GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY IT IS TUESDAY JUNE NINETEENTH. AND WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. I WILL LET EVERYONE KNOW THAT ITEM NUMBER ONE S. B. SIX NINETY ONE LARA AND ITEM NUMBER FOUR S. B. ELEVEN FIFTY FIVE HUESO HAVE BEEN. PULLED FROM OUR HEARING TODAY. SO WE'LL START WITH DOCTOR PAN ITEM NUMBER. SIX S. B.. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR GOOD MORNING NAY. GOOD MORNING MORNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS -- PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR A BILL THAT THE DIRECTS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY GROUP TO STUDY THE PROBLEM OF THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH INTERNET BASED SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. A DRAFT THE MODEL STRATEGIC PLAN FOR SUCH PLATFORMS HELP MITIGATE SPREAD FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH THOSE PLATFORMS. I INTRODUCED S. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE OF A CLEAR ISSUE AND PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES THE SPREAD OF FIRE FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA CERTAINLY [inaudible] SPREADING -- THE ISSUES ABOUT THE FLAT EARTH THOUGH ARE -- AND MAY SEEM SOMEWHAT AMUSING BUT WHEN IT STARTS MOVING TO THINGS LIKE HOLOCAUST DENIAL -- PRODUCTION AND IMMUNIZATION RATES BECAUSE FOR CONTINUED RA REPETITION THAT VACCINES CAUSE AUTISM. GOING TO ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENED. MORE RECENTLY WHERE I YOU HAVE PEOPLE DENYING -- SHOOTINGS THAT HAPPENED AND PLACES LIKE PARK LAND AND AND YEAH AND ACTUALLY I ACTUALLY UP WIND ALSO PRONE TO MANIPULATION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY GET TO A COMPETING PROTESTS AND I AND YOU STAND UP THROUGH MANIPULATION. SPREAD OF FLUFF FALSE INFORMATION THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA THAT FACT WE KNOW THAT -- MANY PEOPLE GET THEIR NEWS PRIMARILY FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. NOW WHAT THE SCIENCE SHOW WALMART TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ON SCIENCE MAGAZINE REPORTED THAT. WHEN THEY INVESTIGATED DIFFERENTIAL DIFFUSION OF ALL THE FAIR BY TRUE AND FALSE NEWS STORIES DISTRIBUTE TWITTER BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN? TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THEY FOUND THAT FALSE INFORMATION FALSEHOODS WOULD DIFFUSE SIGNIFICANT FARTHER FASTER DEEPER MORE BROADLY. THEN TRUE INFORMATION IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION AND FACT THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION SPREAD TWICE AS QUICKLY AND TWICE AS FAR. ARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SINCE SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITES ARE THE PLATFORMS FOR WHICH SOUGHT FALSE INFORMATION SPREADS IT'S GOING TO BECOME MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. SEVERAL COMPANIES ARE COMING UP WITH PLANS TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION BUT PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE AND THEY KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING. BY ASKING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LET'S KNOW IF THEY HAVE A PLAN OF WHAT THOSE PLANS ARE WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW NEWS. SPREADS CONTINUE WORKING GROUP TO STUDY STRATEGIC PLAN MILES BE THE FIRST STEP IN WORKING TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF FALSE INFORMATION OPEN THE FUTURE WILL BE A BETTER BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM. HARM THAT CAN COME FROM THAT CAUSED BY UNTRUE STORIES THIS REALLY BECOMES AT THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY. AND CERTAINLY -- THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER WHAT. I ACTUALLY LIMITING WHAT ANYONE WANTS TO SAY OUR CANCER INCLUDING EVEN. SAYING FALSE INFORMATION -- HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT'S HOW WE ARE PROMOTING HOW THAT'S BEING POTENTIALLY BEING DISSEMINATED IN FACT EVEN OVER TRUTH OUT ACCURATE AND TRUE INFORMATION AND THAT UNDERSTANDING IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS ABOUT OUR SOCIETY MAQRIZI EXPECT WE ASK WHEN I BUT THANK YOU YOU HAVE WITH ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL. ALRIGHT CNN IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SIDE IT THAT BAD APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A STUDY BILL AND AND REALLY TAKING A GOOD LOOK AT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH IN OUR SOCIETY BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME VERY. FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO FREE SPEECH AND THOSE ARE DELICATE WHEN WE DEAL WITH THE INTERNET AND DISSEMINATION OF OF INFORMATION SO I THINK I DO THINK WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL IN. HOW WE SEEK TO RESTRICT INFORMATION EVEN IF WE FIND IT OFFENSIVE OR DIFFICULT OR OR UNCOMFORTABLE? SO I APPRECIATE YOU WAITING IN THIS DIRECTION BUT WE'LL WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES ON RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE OKAY. AND WILL TAKE UP A VOTE ONCE WE HAVE QUITE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND THE SOUND OF IT YOU MAY CLOSE UP OKAY WELL AT FOR I APPRECIATE THAT AND THEN FORM SUCH A STUDY -- WOULD CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT. THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS NOT THE CORE OF OUR NATION AND OUR SOCIETY AND WE WON'T BE SURE THAT THAT IS PROTECTED. WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW INFORMATION IS BEING ASSEMBLY OCCLUDING MISINFORMATION AND THAT AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU. AND WE JUST SAW SENATOR DODD. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR SENATORS WILL DODD [inaudible] AND LARA. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SENATOR WORK WE'RE GOOD ITEM NUMBER TWO S. B..

FOR WHAT TOOK THE STAIRS IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S MY POINT FOR THE DAY BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN FOR MY HEALTH. I THINK THAT IF IT BIT FOR FATHER'S DAY SO. YOU GOT A UNIT WHERE THOU GOT TO USE YEAH [inaudible] ALRIGHT WELL MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OPERA YOUR CONSIDERATION I HAVE BEFORE YOU SEND A BILL. TEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH WILL UPDATE AND ENHANCE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND PRODUCE A MORE REASONABLE BIDDING EXPERIENCE FOR CALIFORNIA'S SUBCONTRACTORS. CURRENT LAW MANDATES INSURANCE COVERAGE HELD BY CONTRACTING PARTIES TO BE DISCLOSED TO BIDDERS DURING THE BIDDING PROCESS FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO SIMILAR MANDATE FOR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL OR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS AND AS A RESULT SUBCONTRACTING BIDDERS ARE OFTEN LEFT IN THE DARK. FORCED TO BE WITHOUT KNOWING THE TRUE COSTS A MEAN KERWIN PARTICIPATING IN THE PROJECTS OWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. THESE DISCLOSURES INCLUDE EXCLUSIONS. TERM OF COVERAGE AND THE MOUNT A PRIMA CONTRIBUTIONS BEING REQUIRED. ALL VITAL COMPONENTS OF INSURANCE POLICY AND FACTORS THAT CONTRACTORS WHO RELY ON IN CRAFTING A BIT. IT'S VERY COSTLY FOR CONTRACTORS TO MODIFY DETAILED BIDS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO ACCOUNT FOR UNFORESEEN COSTS FROM AND INSURANCE POLICIES DEFICIENCIES. BUT THAT'S WHAT MANY OF OUR STATES GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS ARE FACED WITH THE UNDER THIS CURRENT PROCESS. S. B. TEN SEVENTY SEVEN REQUIRES COMMERCIAL PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OWNERS TO PROVIDE FULL AND ACCURATE INSURANCE POLICY INFORMATION TO CONTRACTORS WHO ARE BIDDING ON THEIR JOBS. JUST OF THOSE OPERATING THE RESENT THAT RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION WILL HAVE DONE FOR YEARS WHICH WITH MUCH SUCCESS. ADDITIONALLY SPT AND SEVENTY SEVEN CLOSES LOOPHOLES IN CURRENT LAN BELIEVE MANY OF OUR SUB AND GENERAL CONTRACTORS HOLDING THE BAG FOR LIABILITY THAT SHOULD RIGHTFULLY BE COVERED BY THE PROJECTS RAP INSURANCE POLICY. THIS BILL SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN SUBCULTURES A SUB CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AND THEN UNION ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION AND HAS WIDESPREAD INDUSTRY SUPPORT. WITH ME TODAY SKIP DOM ON BEHALF OF AMERICA SUB CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH DAVE STEP CO. A CONSTITUENT OF MINE AND A ROOFING SUBCONTRACTOR.

TECHIES GET DAHMER BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN SUB CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS BILL REALLY FOLLOWS THE TREND THAT WAS A STEP THAT STARTED LAST YEAR WITH THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KELLY ARROWS TWELVE TWENTY THREE THAT ESTABLISHED PHONE TIMELY DISCLOSURE PAYMENTS. BY PROJECT DONORS TO THE CONTRACTORS THEY KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS THERE WAITING FOR THEM TO BE PAID WITH -- AND SECONDLY THE BILL ESSENTIALLY. GOES TOWARD TRANSPARENCY AND FULL DISCLOSURE IN A TIMELY FASHION OF ALL THE INFORMATION MY SUBCONTRACTORS NEED IN ORDER FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER TO BID AND AT WHAT AMOUNT. THE BILL DOES NOT HARM ANYBODY IN THE PROCESS IT'S GOOD STATE POLICY TO HAVE FALLEN INTO TRANSPARENT DISCLOSURES. AND IT DOES NOT SHIFT LIABILITY IS THE VERY LATE OPPOSITION ASSERTS -- SO WE WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU EXPLICITLY. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH MY NAME IS DOCTOR RONALD CONSTANT. IN I AM THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNION WITHIN CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION. AND WE ARE THE CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. MY ASSOCIATION IS COMPRISED OF UNION AFFILIATED COMMERCIAL ROOFING CONTRACTORS DOMICILED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

AND GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DAVE STUFF CON WITH EVERHART RIFFING LOCATED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. CURRENTLY EMPLOYING TWO HUNDRED UNION EMPLOYEES. AND PAST PRESIDENT CURRENT DIRECTOR THE ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND A CURRENT DIRECTOR THE UNION ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION WHO IS ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AS YOU JUST HEARD. WHAT I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU BRIEFLY AS A A STORY PERSONAL STORY FROM MY COMPANY IS THIS IS THE PART OF THE COMPANY? THAT I MOSTLY DEAL WITH -- LITIGATION INSURANCE ISSUES WORKERS COMP ISSUES. A SCHOOL DISTRICT. HIRES A GENERAL CONTRACTOR. THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR SUBCONTRACTS TO ME AND I AM ROLE IN THE SIT PROGRAM. THE PROJECT GETS DONE IN FIVE YEARS LATER THE OWNER SCHOOL DISTRICT. FILED A CLAIM AGAINST THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOR PROBLEMS ON THE PROJECT. THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR UNBEKNOWNST TO ME FILES A CLAIM DIRECTLY WITH MY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY. MY PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY NOTIFIES ME OF A CLAIM. AND I TELL THEM IT'S A NO STEP MEANWHILE THE HIGHER DEFENSE ATTORNEY FOR ME. THE FIRST MEANING ON SITE IS HELD TO GO OVER THE PROBLEMS THAT. GENERATED THE CLAIM. SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSIP ADMINISTRATOR. ANNOUNCES THAT THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR WAS NEVER ENROLLED IN THE SEP AND THEREFORE IS NOT COVERED BY THE SET. NOW THE QUESTION IS WHY. WE'RE THEY ALLOW DOING NEVER IN ROLE AND HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN. SO FAR THERE'S BEEN NO ANSWER THAT VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION. MY INSURANCE COMPANY FINALLY HAD TO SEND THE LETTER DECLINATION FOR THE COVERAGE AS IT DOES NOT EXIST FOR THIS PROJECT. THEY ALSO PRISON LIMBO THE OWNER HAS DEMANDED RESTITUTION FOR THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IT SPENT ON AN OPERATING WATERTIGHT SOLAR SYSTEM THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR HAS TO MAKE IT RIGHT. BUT BELIEVES IT HAS A CLAIM AGAINST ME MY INSURANCE COMPANY RIGHTFULLY US TONIGHT LIABILITY. FOR ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS CLAIM. THE DISTRICT DOES THAT CARRIER. IS STANDING ON THE SIDELINE SAYING THERE'S A DISCONNECT IN COVERAGE. BECAUSE THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR WAS NEVER ENROLLED AND THE REFER HAS A SUBCONTRACT WITH THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR NOT THE OWNER. IF YOU CAN KEEP UP WITH THAT. THE DISTRICT GO SIP ADMINISTRATOR SAYING HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN. MEANWHILE THE POTENTIAL FROM THE ENTIRE LIABILITY REMAINS ON MY COMPANY ON A PROJECT FOR WHICH I SEEM TO BE CURRENTLY UNINSURED THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE CHRIS WALKER SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SHEETMETAL OR CONDITIONING CONTRACT I GIVE.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT HE BERNACCHI A MAP CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE CONFERENCE THE PLUMBING HEATING PIPING INDUSTRY THE NATIONAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION AND UNITED CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MARKLAND EARLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ROOFING CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. HERE IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SAY NUNS ANY OPPOSITION. DON'T YOU THINK ROOM AT THE TABLE FOR THE OPPOSITION PLEASE WELL. AND WHETHER COMING UP. WE COULD ESTABLISH FORCED STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAU CHIU. HOLDEN KALRA KILEY [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] REYES [inaudible] GONZALEZ FLETCHER. WE DO HAVE A QUORUM [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAVE WALRATH I REPRESENT THE COALITION PRODUCT WHAT SCHOOL HOUSING. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED AND IT IS ON THE INDEMNIFICATION QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED. I DURING THE TESTIMONY OF THE SUPPORTERS. ESSENTIALLY. AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT EMPLOYER. AN OWNER OF A PROJECT. WHEN WE GO HOW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR STATE FUNDS? AND IT'S OVER MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVE TO GO TO A PRE QUALIFICATION PROCESS. THAT REQUALIFICATION PROCESS HAS TO BE CONSISTENT. WITH THE STRUCTURE DEVELOP I THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AND IF IT'S OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICH ALMOST EVERYTHING ELSE. I WILL BE LOOKING AT USING CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS WHO ARE REGISTERED AND WE MUST USE THOSE WERE REGISTERED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AS AN OWNER WE ARE NOT BUILDERS WE'RE NOT CONTRACTORS. AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OUR JOB IS PROVIDE AN EDUCATION STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ADEQUATELY HOUSE. SO THE SITUATION COMES UP AND THE WAY WE'VE READ THIS BILL. IS THAT THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS WOULD CHANGE. AND BY CHANGING THOSE PROVISIONS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT ON I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED LIABILITY THAT THEY DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE. FOR PROBLEMS THAT WERE CREATED ON THE JOB SITE. MOST LIKELY UP BY PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYEES CONTRACTORS THAT WE HAVE HIRED. UNDER THE PROCESS THAT SUPPOSEDLY WILL PROVIDE US QUALITY. CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT COMES IN AND DOES NOT HAVE [inaudible] SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. THE LIABILITY ISSUE WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. OUR OUR CONCERN IS THAT A UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE'RE CURRENTLY INDEMNIFY. THE TAXPAYER WOULD BE ON THE HOOK. FOR TRYING TO CORRECT THE SITUATION. THAT WAS NOT OF THEIR MAKING. FOR THOSE REASONS WERE UP. I THINK THAT. MARIN PIN AND I WITH THAT STATEWIDE EDUCATIONAL WRAP UP PROGRAM JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY WE REPRESENT -- WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT ARE OUR MEMBERS -- IT WE FIVE FIND IT OVER HOT WE COVER OVER FIVE THOUSAND CONTRACTORS IN THE PAST. AND JUST FOR A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ABOUT UP OPPOSITION BEING THEY SAID IT WAS GOING TO SAY WHEN A FACEBOOK FRIENDS ANYMORE SKIP IT WE ARE. WE YEAH WE TRY WHAT THAT WHAT STAFF CUT MEAN TO THEM MONTHS AGO ASKING FOR DAYS PLOT THIS SECTION TO COME OFF. AND WE'VE. FIVE SIX WEEKS PRESS ARE NEED I NEED FOR THAT OUT CLASS TO COME UP BUT NOT INTO RECENTLY WERE TOLD THAT THAT WAS NOT COMING OFF SO THAT'S WHY. THAT WE HAVE TO AYE WHY ACTUALLY WENT FROM SUPPORT AMENDED TO OPPOSE THEM AND THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITE. RUNNING AROUND ACROSS THE WEEKLY CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO BOTH MUST AMENDED. AND OUR CONCERNS ARE PRIMARILY WITH THE INDEMNITY PROVISIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND CENTER PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE INDEMNITY. SURE WHO I'LL BE THAT'S MISTER DOM. ALRIGHT SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE LETTER OF OPPOSITION FROM THE SCHOOL CONSTITUENCIES. INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN AN IMMUNITY RELIABILITY AND WHEREAS THE LETTER SAID THAT SUBCONTRACTOR SIT ON THE SIDELINES -- WE DON'T THINK THAT THE ROOFER SHOULD PAY FOR THE ELECTRICIAN'S ERRORS. SO WHAT THE BILL DOES CLARIFY FOR ALL TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION A CONSISTENT BIDDING PROCESS WHEREBY WE KNOW AS SUBCONTRACTORS Y. TYPE OF INSURANCE IS BEING OFFERED TO US UNDER THIS RAP PROGRAM. IT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR WOULD OFFER ADEQUATE LIABILITY PROVISIONS IN TERMS OF DEDUCTIBILITY. THE TERM OF THE POLICY HOW LONG AFTERWARDS THAT THE PROJECT IS DONE EXCEPTIONS TO THE POLICY. THAT I THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. BUT THEN TO SAY THAT THIS IS A COST TO THE TAXPAYERS WHEN IN FACT. IF THEY HAD OFFER THIS INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY AND INFO IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE KETTLE CALLING THE POT BLACK. IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF THEM NOT OFFERING AN ADEQUATE INSURANCE POLICY TO BEGIN WITH. THAT WE HAVE TO LABOR WITHIN COULD BE ON THE HOOK FOR YEARS TO COME. SO WE DON'T THINK THEIR ARGUMENTS ARE VALID. I THINK THEY MISINTERPRETED THE BILL. AND THIS IS STATE POLICY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO LAST YEAR WITH PAYMENTS FROM PUBLIC ENTITIES. SO FOR THAT REGARD FOR THOSE REASONS WE THINK THAT THEM THEIR ARGUMENTS HAVE MISPLACED. I I STRUGGLE A BIT WITH THAT THAT EXPLANATION I THINK I'M NOT. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THAT THIS IS IN FACT SHIFTING THE INDEMNITIES OF THOSE I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS BILL AND HAVING GONE THROUGH THIS. BEEN HAVING BEEN ON THE SCHOOL BOARD WHERE THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS CAUSED BY A SUBCONTRACTOR IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TAXPAYERS WERE THEN OUT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THEIR INVESTMENT. EVEN THOUGH WE WON THE SUIT WE BASICALLY PAID PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR [inaudible] AND HAVING BEEN. A PART OF A GOVERNING ORGANIZATION NOT THE EXPERTISE AND CONSTRUCTION. THAT IT SOARED SHIFTING THAT BURDEN OBLIGATIONS FOR INSURANCE OUR OBLIGATIONS TO BE PROACTIVE SHIFTING THAT'S A PUBLIC AGENCY IS IS REALLY THAT RESEMBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT THE EXPERTS AND THAT'S SO AYE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS BILL. SHIFTS THE INDEMNITY. IN IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY IF I WAS BY I DO BRISTLE A BIT AT YOUR POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK ISSUE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE THAT EXPECTING. A PUBLIC AGENCY TO TO BE -- TO BE EXPERTS IN IN SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY'RE REALLY NOT AND TO BE PUTTING ONLINE VERY. LIMITED PUBLIC DOLLARS ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMETHING IS FUNDED THROUGH A THROUGH BOND OR OR OTHER PROVISIONS SO IT'S I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE'RE PUSHING BACK ON ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND LOCAL AGENCIES. THANK YOU OTHER WHY I THINK I THINK THE POINT WAS WITH THE MORE INFORMATION. THAT ACTUALLY IF WE IF. WE ALL HAD. IMPLENIA FORMATION WHAT ACTUALLY WOULD SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND IN THE LONG RUN. I THINK THAT'S A POINT HE WAS MAKING. YEAH OKAY LA IF LITIGATION ENSUES THAT'S THE TAXPAYER HOPE YEAH WE DON'T BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS. WITH ADDITIONAL. DISCLOSURES THAT THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING ARE GONNA BE LASSEN THAT'S I THINK THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BILL. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECONDS SENATOR. YOU MAY CLOSE. I GET ALL THIS DOES IS IT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SO ALL PARTIES HAVE ACCESS TO IT SO THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR THEIR WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR I BELIEVE THAT WITH THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IT ACTUALLY WILL SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS. BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LESS LITIGATION AND I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA PLEASE DON'T AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I. CHAO CHU.

FIFTEEN HUNDRED FROM THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS SENATOR DODD. GOOD MORNING TO NUMBER THREE SB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE STARTS WHEN IT WOULD ANSWER. GREAT GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. OUT S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS A COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FUTURE DATA BREACHES AND PUNISH COMPANIES THAT FAIL TO PROTECT DATA. THE EQUIFAX BREACH AFFECTED A HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION CONSUMERS 59% OF THE UNITED STATES POPULATION. MAKING IT THE LARGEST THEFT OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. IN HISTORY. UNDER CURRENT LAW CONSUMERS IT. IN THE FACT HAVE NO RECOURSE AGAINST EQUIFAX OR OTHER BIG CORPORATIONS THAT NEGLECT PROTECTING OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. WITH MORE MORE BRIDGES. IT PERSONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE DARK WEB ESTABLISHING THE DIRECT CONNECTION BETWEEN TO THE TO IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IF YOUR IDENTITY GET STOLEN HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW WHETHER THE DATA CAME FROM EQUIFAX BREACH WORK COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PARTY. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S DATA BREACH LAWS GIVING CONSUMERS RECOURSE SO THEY'LL BE AN INCENTIVE FOR COMPANIES TO TAKE REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES. TO PROTECT OUR DATA. THIS BILL CLARA CLARIFIES THAT THE CONSUMERS COVERED BY DATA BREACH PROTECTIONS NOT JUST A CUSTOMER. THE EQUIFAX BREACH DEMONSTRATED THE CONSUMERS CANNOT ALWAYS BE DEFIED THAT'S CUSTOMERS. A LOT THIS BILL ALSO ALLIANCE THE INFORMATION PRACTICES ACT WITH THE CONFIDENTIAL. CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION ACT BY ADDING DAMAGES OF BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FAILURE TO TAKE REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES AND FAILURE TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS. THUS DISCOURAGING BRIDGES BY ADDING TEETH OFF. HE HAD HOLDS COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE HARM THEY BECAUSE AS A RESULT OF DATA BREACHES BY CLARIFYING THAT THE CONSUMER ME EEK TO READ. SEEK REDRESS UP TO FOUR YEARS FROM WHEN THEY SUFFER FINANCIAL HARM NOT WHEN THE BREACH JUST WHEN THE BRIDGE CURSE. THE BILL ALSO MAKES CLEAR THE CONSUMERS CAN JOIN A CLASS ACTIONS TO HOLD A NEGLIGENT THE COMPANY ACCOUNTABLE. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE ON AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF WHAT A REASONABLE SECURITY MEASURES AND HOW TO DEFINE THEM. IN A SEPT IN THIS THAT SENATE WE TOOK NARROWING AMENDMENTS THAT MAKE CLEAR THE BILL ONLY APPLIES IF THE BUSINESS. DOES NOT. IN CRYPTO REDACT DATA LET ME JUST REPEAT THAT. IN WE TOOK A AMENDMENTS THAT MAKE CLEAR THAT. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES IF A COMPANY DOES NOT ENCRYPT REDACTED AT ALSO. KEEP THE NAMES PLOT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OR FINANCIAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION. IT DOESN'T APPLY IF IT DOES NOT MAINTAIN REASONABLE SECURED. SECURITY SECURITY MEASURES REQUIRED UNDER THE EXISTING LAW. AND IS BREACHED. AGAIN THIS IS THE COMMONSENSE MEASURE TO HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM FUTURE DATA BREACHES AND PUNISH COMPANIES THAT FAIL TO PROPERLY PROTECT. OUR SENSITIVE PERSONAL DATA. WITH ME TODAY -- I HAVE BUT TIMOTHY BLOOD WHO'S A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS CALIFORNIA IT EMILY RUSH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALPERS. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU. I AM SICK AND I'M EMILY RASH I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALPERS THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP. I WORKOUT PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL AND WE WORKED ON BILLS TWENTY YEARS AGO TO ESTABLISH THE NATION'S FIRST SECURITY FREEZE MEASURE GIVING CONSUMERS THE ABILITY ABILITY TO BETTER PROTECT THEIR INFORMATION. AS WELL AS DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION BELLS AYE BUT UNFORTUNATELY CONSUMERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE STILL AT THE RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT. ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY THERE WAS SEVENTEEN POINT SIX MILLION AMERICANS OR 70% OF THE POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN THAT WERE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT IN. TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THE MEAN FRAUD AMOUNT WAS OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR IDENTITY THEFT VICTIMS. AND I AM WE ARE READY TO WE ALREADY KNEW THAT. IDENTITY THEFT AND DATA BREACHES WERE A BIG PROBLEM BUT THEN OF COURSE -- THE EQUIFAX DATA BREACH OCCURRED LAST YEAR IT WAS LAST MAY WHEN EQUIFAX FAILED TO INSTALL BASIC SECURITY UPDATES ON THEIR SYSTEMS. DIDN'T DISCOVER IT THAT PROBLEM FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AND OVER HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS HAD THEIR DATA BREACH DATA BREACHED. I'M I WAS ONE OF THEM WHAT OF THOSE NEARLY HALF OF AMERICA WHO POPPED UP ON THE LIST FROM EQUIFAX. AND I MADE SURE THAT I'D SIT SAT DOWN. AND HONEST IT TOOK AWHILE TO MAKE SURE THAT I WENT THROUGH AND I ACTUALLY ASKED FOR SECURITY FREEZE FROM EACH OF THE THREE MAJOR CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. SIGNED UP TO GET A PIN NUMBER SO THAT I COULD JUMP HELP PROTECT MYSELF FROM NEW ACCOUNT FRAUD. ON BUT ALL HAVE TO MONITOR THIS FOR YEARS TO COME BECAUSE AMONG YOU KNOW THE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WERE BREACHED OF MIND WHERE THINGS LIKE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER DRIVER'S LICENSE THINGS THAT WON'T GO AWAY. UNDER THIS BILL WE ARE REALLY HERE AND WE DECIDE TO CO SPONSOR THE SPELL -- AND WORK WITH SENATOR DIED BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO PREVENT THE NEXT NEGLIGENT DATA BREACH FROM OCCURRING HERE IN THE STATE. I'M THE WITH THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT WHEN A COMPANY IS NEGLIGENT WITH CONSUMERS DATA. AND A BREACH OCCURS THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE CONSUMER. ON FOR THE WORK THE TO DO THAT WE HAVE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT OURSELVES MUCH LESS THE FACT THAT WE COULD BE THEM VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO BUSINESSES THAT DO NOT ENCRYPT A REDACT CONSUMERS DATA. THAT KEEP CONSUME AT EITHER THEN OUR NAME PLUS EITHER SO SECURITY NUMBER DRIVER'S LICENSE OR FINANCIAL ACCOUNT INFORMATION SO THAT. THE PIECES OF INFO THAT WILL MAKE IT MOST LIKELY THAT WE ARE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT LATER. IF THE BUSINESS FAILS TO PROTECT OUR DATA AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW AND THEN THE DATA IS PREACHED IN THOSE INSTANCES. I AM A CONSUMER COULD SEEK RECOURSE FROM THE COMPANY AND E THINK THAT'S IN HIGH HARLEY APPROPRIATE. I'M BENEFICIAL FOR CONSUMERS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WILL ACTUALLY INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO KEEP OUR INFORMATION SECURE IN THE FIRST PLACE. I URGE DRIVE OUT. THANK YOU. WHOSE. THANK YOU AGAIN MY NAME IS TIMOTHY BLOOD I'M FROM SAN DIEGO IDEA IN IN ADDITION TO BEING A BOARD MEMBER OF CHAU SEE -- I'VE ALSO LITIGATED NUMBER OF DATA BREACH -- BILL ARE CASES I'M. CALIFORNIA'S BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF DATA PRIVACY FOR DECADES LITERALLY SINCE THE SINCE THE EARLY SEVENTIES. YOU RITA A BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN THE LAWN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS. IT WAS UP PASSED YESTERDAY IN HIS IS CURRENT AND ADDRESSES THE CONCERNS THE CALIFORNIANS CALIFORNIANS HAVE OVER DATA PRIVACY. PROBLEM IS TECHNOLOGY HAS OUTSTRIPPED THE LAW SO WE DON'T NOW HAVE A* ANY STATUTORY PROTECTION THAT ACTUALLY WORKS IT ENDS UP PROVIDING THE INCENTIVES OF OF GOOD COMPANIES TO PROTECT DATA. IT INCENTIVIZE BAD COMPANIES TO NOT PROTECT DATA AND HAS THE EFFECT OF ALLOWING A DATA PROP IDENTITY THEFT THIEVES -- OPPORTUNITIES TO OBTAIN DATA -- AYE PRIVACY DATA PRIVATE DATA AND THEN -- USING IT USE THAT THE STEEL ARE. CONSUMER INFORMATION AND MONEY. I'M THIS BILL DOES A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS I'M. FIRST OF ALL CHANGES THE DEFINITION OF OF A CONSUMER TO ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE WAY USED TO BE IS THE PERSON OR THE COMPANY THAT YOU HAD A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH. A WAS THE ONE THAT HAD YOU WRITE YOUR AT PRIVATE INFORMATION THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE NOW IT IS LARGE DATA AGGREGATORS THAT HAVE YOUR INFORMATION. PEOPLE YOU DO NOT HAVE ANY COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH EQUIFAX IS A GOOD EXAMPLE THEY'RE NOT JUST A CREDIT BUREAU. BECAUSE OF THEY ARE ALSO DATA AGGREGATOR IN FACT THEY ARE PRIMARILY A DATA AGGREGATOR AND REGULAR CONSUMERS HAVE NO. BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANIES LIKE EQUIFAX IN TERMS OF OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DO WITH THAT INFORMATION SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. THAT CHANGES THAT SO THAT IT WOULD APPLY TO WOULD MAKE THIS STATUTE AFFABLE OUGHT TO PROTECT ALL PEOPLE -- DOT RATHER THAN JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP THE SECOND THING IT DOES IS IT PROVIDES FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES AND I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION. ON WHAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES PROVISION DOES THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT CONCEPTS AT ISSUE HERE. ONE CONCEPT IS IDENTITY THEFT SO THAT'S WHEN AID IDENTITY THIEF TAKES YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND ACTUALLY USE THAT TO DRAIN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY TO PROFIT SOMEHOW ILLEGALLY FROM YOUR INFORMATION. WE WANT TO PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. ONCE THERE IS A DATA BREACH WHICH IS WHEN THE DATA THIEVES GO IN AND TAKE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM A COMPANY THAT IS NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECTING IT. PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE STEPS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT. AND WHAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES DO IS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED TO SPEND. TO TAKE THOSE STEPS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. SO FOR EXAMPLE EQUIFAX CHARGES TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION NOW THIS IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE PROTECTION IT'S NOT GONNA GOING TO PREVENT IDENTITY THEFT. BUT IT IS GOING TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF IDENTITY THEFT FROM OCCURRING. IT WILL EFFECTIVELY IF PEOPLE HAVE IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION. IT WILL DISINCENTIVE BUYS IDENTITY THIEVES. FROM FROM STEALING INFORMATION TO BEGIN WITH. AND THEN USING UP THE PROFIT BECAUSE IT'LL BE HARDER FOR THEM TO PROFIT IF PEOPLE HAVE IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION. SO IT'S TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AND SO FOR IT AND THE STATURE DAMAGES RANGE FROM. A TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION WHAT TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH THAT ONE CAN DO THE MATH -- TUNER DOLLARS IS LESS THAN ONE YEAR'S WORTH OF IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION. MOST EXPERTS WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT IS IN ALMOST ALL DAY THAT. A DATA BREACH CASES ONE YEAR IS NOT REALLY ENOUGH IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION BUT IT'S A GOOD START. A THOUSAND DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY DOING THE MATH IS JUST OVER FOUR YEARS OF IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION. IF YOU HAVE YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY AYE NUMBER TAKEN THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE PIECE OF INFORMATION AND YOU WILL NEED TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM IDENTITY THEFT FOR FAR MORE THAN FOUR YEARS BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR SOUL SECURITY NUMBER. FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE SO HAT IS THE PURPOSE OF STATUTORY DAMAGES IT'S IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE HAVE NOT SUFFERED ECONOMIC HARM. PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED ECONOMIC HARM. THEY NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM IDENTITY THEFT. NOW KEEP IN MIND WHAT THIS ENDS UP DOING. THE BILL WILL INCENTIVIZE BAD COMPANIES COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY TAKING THE TIME AND EFFORT. PROTECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION AND IT INCENTIVIZE THEM TO ACT LIKE THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPANIES THAT ACTUALLY DO PROTECT PEOPLE'S INFORMATION. THE OTHER THING IT DOES IS IF PEOPLE BY ADEQUATE IDENTITY THEFT PROTECTION. THEN IT STARS THE DATA THIEVES. THEY THE THIEVES LIKE ANY FEE. FOLLOW THE PATH LEAST RESISTANCE IF THEY CANNOT PROFIT OFF OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN STEPS TO PROTECT YOURSELF. IDENTITY THEFT WILL DECREASE. PETER UP PLEASE I ABSOLUTELY AND THEN THE LAST PIECE OF IS THE NOTIFICATION. PORTION OF IT THE NOTIFICATION PORTION OF THE STATUTE -- RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO -- CONSEQUENCES TO A COMPANY THAT FAILS TO IDENTIFY PEOPLE IN THE EVENT OF A OF A DATA BREACH. OF THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE STATURE DAMAGES TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO DO THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IF YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. JERRY MEMBERS KEVIN BACON AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THAT. SET THE COURT ON BEHALF OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARINGHOUSE ALSO IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST MAY CONSUMERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS IN SUPPORT. SHANE GUSMAN ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS UNITE HERE AT UTILITY WORKERS UNION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SING KNOWN AS OUR OPPOSITION ONE MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M SARAH BOOT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. SCOPE OF THIS BILL IS MASSIVE IT APPLIES TO BUSINESSES OF EVERY SIZE NON PROFITS ASSOCIATIONS UNIONS. BASICALLY IT'S YOUR DATA IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BILL'S EXPANSION OF WHO CAN SUE MASSIVE. ANY CONSUMER CAN BRING A CLAIM CONSUMERS DEFINED AS ANY NATURAL PERSON NOT EVEN LIMITED CALIFORNIANS. MOST TROUBLING IS THIS BILLS MASSIVE EXPANSION OF LIABILITY SP ELEVEN TWENTY ONE CREATES TO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND THEY DON'T REQUIRE ANY PROOF OF INJURY. EVEN WORSE THE NEW DEFINITION OF DATA BREACH IN THIS BILL DOESN'T EVEN REQUIRE THAT A CONSUMER'S DATA BE TAKEN. ON TOP OF ALL THAT S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD IMPOSE A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS MAXIMUM OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN STATUTORY DAMAGES PER PERSON PER INCIDENT AGAIN WITH NO PROOF OF INJURY. LIABILITY FACED BY BUSINESS OR NON PROFIT WOULD BE STAGGERING LEFT BUT COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE A SMALL BUSINESS WITH JUST A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS BUT SUFFERS A DATA BREACH COULD BE FACING CIVIL LIABILITY OF UP TO MILLION DOLLARS. AND NOT ONLY THAT THE STATUTORY DAMAGES ARE CUMULATIVE MEETING THE STOCK ON TO OTHER DAMAGES SO FOR EXAMPLE IF S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS ADOPTED. AND NOT PRIVACY INITIATIVE IS PASS WHICH ALSO CONTEMPLATES A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STATUTORY DAMAGES PER PERSON PER BREACH. ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT SAME SMALL BUSINESS WITH A THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. IS LOOKING AT BUT DAMAGES OF UP TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN FACE OF SUCH MASSIVE RISK BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS ARE GONNA BE LEVERAGED INTO AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE STRENGTH OF THEIR DEFENSE SO THE ARGUMENT TO THIS BILL IS ONLY GONNA APPLY. TO BAD ACTORS ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE IT WILL UNQUESTIONABLY RESULT IN SHE COUNTY TO PREACH LAWSUITS. AND ALL THESE LAWSUITS ARE NOT GONNA MAKE CALIFORNIANS ANY SAY FURTHER NOT GONNA PREVENT DATA BREACHES BUSINESSES ALREADY HAVE SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVES TO AVOID DATA BREACHES IN THESE INCLUDE CIVIL LAWSUITS BY CUSTOMERS AND CREDIT CARD COMPANIES. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS BY AG'S DAMAGES TO THE REPUTATION DAMAGES TO THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND OUR CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW -- COMPANIES RD. IN MANY CASES BUT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE -- MITIGATION SERVICES LIKE PRE CRIME. IN THE WAKE OF A BRIDGE AGAIN THAT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A POP RIGHT THERE AS WE HEARD. ONE THE OTHER THING THIS BILL IS NOT GONNA HELP THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY INJURED DUE TO A DATA BREACH OF S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY ONCE ADOPTED A CONSUMER CLAIMS ARE MOST LIKELY CAN BE ROLLED INTO EARLY CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENTS. SO IF THE CONSUMER DOES SUFFER AN INJURY AT A LATER DATE THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITHOUT RECOURSE. NO ONE FINAL POINT I WANT TO MAKE -- THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A SAFE HARBOR FOR COMPANIES ENCRYPT DATA -- ENCRYPTION IS DEFINITELY STRONGER PROTECTION BUT IT'S NOT IRON CLAD YOU CAN HAVE -- BROUGH A BREACH THAT RESULTS IN THE DECRYPTION OF DATA DO TO ASSIST TICKET CRIMINAL -- COULD BE AN ERROR BY AN EMPLOYEE OFTEN DATA IS IN TRANSIT AND IT'S NOT CRYPTIC AT THAT TIME -- AND SO COMPANY THAT GOES OUT TROUBLE TO TAKE THE HEIGHTENED MEASUREMENT TIGHTEN MEASURE OF ENCRYPTION AND THEN ULTIMATELY FACES A BREACH THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNDER THE SAME. STATUTORY PENALTIES ANYBODY ELSE GET IT THIS AT THE OTHER DAY THIS LAWSUIT. EVEN THE END OF THE DAY THE LAWSUITS CREATED BY THIS BILL. THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP CYBERCRIME. NOT GONNA PREVENT DATA BREACHES IN THERE NOT THAT HELP MAKE VICTIMS HOLE SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSIST WHICH CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN DORY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL DISASSOCIATION. ON I THINK THAT IT IS CLEAR THAT SENATOR DODD AS HE IS -- A GOOD AT HAS IDENTIFIED A TIMELY SOCIETAL ISSUE. THAT IS IMPORTANT EVERYONE ON A DATA BREACH IS A REGULAR NEWS THEY'RE HAPPENING OFTEN THE PUBLIC AWARE OF IT. ON AND THEY'RE LEGITIMATELY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TO DO -- THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT DONE BY OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL THE TIME -- NOW SENATOR A COUPLE HARRIS FIFTY MILLION RECORDS OR BREACH OF A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. TWENTY FOUR MILLION OF THOSE WERE PREACHING TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH MEANS IN THAT YEAR THREE FIFTHS OF CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCED SOME FORM OF DATA BREACH AS IDENTIFIED UNDER THIS BILL. ON THERE IS A PLETHORA OF EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THAT THIS TREND IS GOING TO CONTINUE WE'RE NOT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO SOLVE IT. ON AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS THAT NOW THE CRIMINALS ARE INCREASINGLY GOING AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES 43% OF THE TIME. IN CERTAIN TYPES OF ATTACKS ARE SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED SMALL BUSINESS -- THE US NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY LANCE FOUND THAT 6% OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE UNABLE. STAYING THERE BUSINESS SIX MONTHS AFTER A CYBERCRIME ATTACK. SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE. THE QUESTION REALLY BECOMES IS SUING. ARM A THE WAY TO SOLVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE A HAMMER EVERYTHING DOES START TO LOOK LIKE A NAIL EVENTUALLY WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT TO SUE ABOUT THIS. AND I THINK THAT -- WHAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE COURSE OF LITIGATION IS THAT? COM CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WHILE THEY DON'T ALWAYS CIVIC WE BENEFIT THAT MUCH OF CONSUMERS ARE A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE'VE ALL RECEIVED THOSE. ON NOTICES IN THE MAIL THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT YOU KNOW EX COUPON OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OUT OF A OUT OF A A A CLASS ACTION. THE ARGUMENT REALLY COMES DOWN TO DOES IT THE TO HER. AND WHY I'M HERE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CLEAR THERE'S ALREADY. FROM LARGE AMOUNT OF DETERRENCE ON THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SURVEY THAT SHOWS THAT THAT ACTUALLY ANY DAY TO BE BREACH ALREADY COST THE VICTIM. WHICH IS OR TALK ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN ATTACKED CREE ON A AN AVERAGE OF THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ON IN THERE EQUIFAX LAWSUIT WHICH IS ON THE A YOU KNOW SORT OF THE STATED. THAT ONE OF THE MAIN STATED -- MOTIVATORS OF THE BILL THEIR TWENTY THREE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST A EQUIFAX I'M THEY DROPPED. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN MARKET SHARE THE DAY AFTER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COMPANIES ALREADY HAVE TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY -- AND SO WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT THIS IS A BLUNT INSTRUMENT. AS ARE UP MY COLLEAGUES ARE TESTIFIED IT DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HOW SERIOUS THE DATA THAT'S PREACHED IS AND WHAT THE PENALTY SHOULD BE. ON IT ACCUMULATES -- IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT BECAUSE IT HITS EVERYBODY IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOMB THERE BEEN SEVENTEEN NOTICED. DATA BREACHES IN CALIFORNIA SINCE I TESTIFIED THIS ON THIS IN THE SENATE THAT INCLUDES THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. I'M WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY THE BILL BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES -- PUBLIC ENTITIES -- AND SO ON IT'S A BLUNT INSTRUMENT BECAUSE I'M IT DOES NOT ALLOW ON EH HELP PEOPLE ACTUALLY PREVENT. DATA BREACHES IT JUST PUNISHES AND THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY IS. ON I GET THAT THERE'S A STANDARD OF REASONABLENESS HERE BUT BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN IN A STATUTE THAT REQUIRES. PUBLIC NOTICE OF DATA BREACHES WHICH WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE ON AND IF YOU LOOK THROUGH THAT THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL'S -- LIST A LOT OF PEOPLE BE COVERED UNDER THIS BILL THEIR OFFICES HAVE BEEN BROKEN INTO AND THEIR PHYSICAL. COMPUTERS OF INSTALLING ON AND SO YOU KNOW DOES OF THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE AND THE DEFENSE SAYING WE TOOK EVERY REASONABLE PRECAUTION WE COULD BUT THERE WAS A DATA BREACH. THEY WILL GET SUED THEY WILL HAVE TO SETTLE BECAUSE OF THE ASTRONOMICAL NUMBERS ASSOCIATE WITH THE BILL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW THE THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. TO GIVE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE.

SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS. WRITE A LETTER [inaudible] CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ID ONE QUESTION THAN ONE COMMENT SO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT BALLOT MEASURE IN THIS TOPIC THAT'S GOING TO NOVEMBER I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN THAT MEASURE AND YOUR BILL COULD YOU GO INTO THAT JUST SO WE HAVE A SENSE. IF IT HAPPENS TO PASS. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER I I HAVE NOT. I DON'T KNOW MAYBE MY WITNESSES COULD -- OPINED ON THAT I HAVEN'T SPENT MUCH TIME. NOT YET IT THERE IS OVERLAP AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT IN COME AUGUST OR LATER. IN THE YEAR THERE IS -- CHATTERING OUT AMENDMENTS THAT CAN BE DONE WITH THIS BILL SOME I THINK IT WOULD BE IT EASY. LANGUAGE FIX TO THIS BILL THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THAT -- THAT BALLOT MEASURE PASSED AND THEN THIS WOULD BE AFFECTED AND THAT COULD BE CURIOUSLY BUT THERE IS OVERLAP -- YOU KNOW MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS pVERY MUCH APPRECATE THE AUTHOR AND YOUR SUPPORTERS I THINK FOR ADDRESSING SOMETHING THAT WE ALL KNOW NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED RIGHT WE WE WE KNOW ABOUT THIS DATA BREACHES. OF THEIR CATASTROPHIC -- AND I I I I I WAS THE BEEN LISTENING TO THE MARKET ALONE -- IS ENOUGH CLEARLY IT HAS NOT PROVEN TO BE ENOUGH I THINK WE NEED MORE WE NEED MORE FOR CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE -- TO TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS THAT BEING SAID I'M STILL THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS PRECISELY THE RIGHT BALANCE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO TO PRIVACY IN THAT IT HAS TO GO TO THE FLOOR. AND I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE THAT BEEN SAID LOOKING FORWARD TO AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW BEING DISCUSSED. FOR THE NEXT COMMITTEE AND FOR THE FLOOR FOR US TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THIS IS HARD. ARE REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND AND HOPEFULLY -- I DON'T THINK THE RIGHT ANSWER IS DOING NOTHING UP WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING THE QUESTION IS EXACTLY HOW IT STRUCK THAT SO. OUT WITH THAT A I WILL BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS BILL OUT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU CENTER. FOR BRING THIS BOARD IS DEATHLY A TOUGH ISSUE TO TAKE ON AND AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN. FROM MANY IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND AND I APPRECIATE HAVE NOT CHANGED ME WITH SOME OF THEM. ABOUT THIS BILL AS WELL ABOUT IT AND SO THOSE. THOSE A MENTION THAT. IT ONLY APPLIES TO COMPANIES WHO DO NOT ENCRYPT REDACT DATA. AND SO A LOT OF MENTION AS OFTENTIMES A CASE OF FOCUS ALSO SMALL BUSINESS YEAR SMALL DISNEY HURT. BUT THAT I THINK ABOUT A LEASE RETAIL. BUSINESSES -- EVEN DOWN THE HALL TO THE COFFEE SHOP HERE THEY HAD THE YOU SWIPE YOUR CARD OR SOMETIMES THEY HAD TO SQUARE. IS THAT ENCRYPTED. YES IT'S ENCRYPTED AND AND THERE ARE FEDERAL LAWS THAT GOVERN CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND AND VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESSES FOLLOW THEM. TYPICALLY THE THE ONES THAT DON'T FOLLOW THEM ARE THE VERY VERY LARGE COMPANIES TARGET AND HOME DEPOT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE. SHOCKINGLY NOT FOLLOWING -- FEDERAL LAW WITH REGARD -- TO PROCESSING CREDIT CARDS SMALL BUSINESSES OUTSOURCE ALL OF THAT THAT'S THAT ENDS UP BEING TAKEN CARE OF ANYWAY. AND THE AS IT SHOULD BE. AND SO I AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE MOST COMMON. YOU KNOW HAVE FOR AT LEAST BE TELL PURPOSES OFF THE SHELF PRODUCTS ARE ENCRYPTED WITH YOU GET IT TO OTHERS NAPA PRODUCT ANOTHER KIND A PRODUCT THAT'S BECAUSE MOST COMMONLY USED -- BEFORE RETAIL PURPOSES NOW DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE OTHER. AREAS IN WHICH DATA IS COLLECTED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE RELEVANT AS WELL AND SO THERE WOULD BE A BURDEN. AYE ON ALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING SMALL BUSINESSES TO HAVE -- TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO TO PROTECT THE DATA I THINK ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN [inaudible] TO YOU KNOW. IF AS WAS ALLUDED TO BY MY COLLEAGUE NO -- KIND OF WHO SHOULD THE OWNERS BEYOND AND WHO'S IN THE BEST POSITION. PROTECT THE DATA IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER OR IS THAT THE COMPANY BIGGER SMALL -- I ALSO AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT THAT I I YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH WHAT IS TRYING TO BE DONE I DO UNDERSTAND THERE'S GONNA BE MORE WORK DONE ON THE BILL. OPTICALLY AS GOES IN FLORIDA AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OTHER COMMITTEES BEFORE GOES THE FOR I'M I'M. THE SENATE BUT SATISFY SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE POSITIVE. INTO A DEAL WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS I THINK ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS FROM THE OF THE VARIOUS BUSINESS INTERESTS BUT I THINK THE UNDERLYING. GOAL HERE IS A OF IS NOT ONE THE MARKET BY ITSELF WILL CORRECT -- FOR I AND I DO THINK. GEISHAS BETTER PLACED UPON THOSE THAT CAN ACTUALLY. BARRETT NOW THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THAT AGAIN I'LL LOOK FORWARD. TO AMENDMENTS AND AND YOU KNOW THE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS LAWS THAT THAT THE NEXT COMMITTEES GOES FORWARD SO ALL I'M ARGUING IS SUPPORTED TODAY BUT I'M OF THE AYE AGAIN AS I AM. THOSE NUMBERS TO INDICATE WILL BE INCIDENTS SEEING WHAT AMENDMENT SELDOM OCCUR BUT BEFORE BECAUSE OF FLOOR. THANK YOU ISRAEL'S. THANK YOU SENATOR I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT WITHOUT A DOUBT IT WOULDN'T THERE ARE BREACHES. WE DO HAVE VICTIMS I DISAGREE THAT THE VICTIM. IS NOT THE BUSINESS IT IS A CONSUMER. AND THAT'S WHO AT EIGHT IN MY OPINION WHO WE DO NEED TO PROTECT [inaudible] BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT COULD BE PERCEIVED AS AN OVER REACH IT'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. CONSUMERS -- BUT PERHAPS THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE I'M GLAD I SIT IN PRIVACY SO I DO GET TO SEE YOUR YOUR NEXT AMENDMENTS. AND I I AGREE THERE WERE SOME VERY GOOD POINTS BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION THAT I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE AGAIN I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE. TAKE A LONG LOOK AT THOSE -- TO BE SURE THAT WHAT WE DO DOES NOT CAUSE ADDITIONAL HARM I KNOW THAT JUST RECENTLY HERE IN JUDICIARY. WE DID VOTE ON A ASSEMBLY MEMBER TODAY AT CHURCH AT CHAO'S THE BILL. PROVIDING THIRTY DAYS TO REPAIR SO IF THERE IS A BREACH THEN YOU HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO TAKE CARE OF IT OTHERWISE THEN THERE THERE IS A LIABILITY. SO THESE ARE THE SORTS OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD INTO PRIVACY BUT I DO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING CARE TO MAKE SURE THAT. ESPECIALLY WITH THOSE WHO. HOW OF THIS INFORMATION? AND THEY ALLOW A. B. DATA BREACH. THEY DO NEED TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE WITHOUT A DOUBT. BECAUSE THOSE CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BEAR THE BRUNT OF OF HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE'S ERROR -- THE EXAMPLE GIVEN OF A COMPUTER BEING STOLEN OBVIOUSLY THAT WE'VE GOT TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THAT ALSO IN THE BILL. BUT I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I TO OUT TODAY WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT AND DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT COMES -- IN PRIVACY [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A LOT PROBABLY TO BE SET ON THIS BILL IN THIS AREA IT'S A VERY COMPLEX AREA AND IN FACT FOR THE SIX YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE ISSUES LIKE THIS COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THEY'RE ALWAYS ATTEMPTS THAT. INDUSTRY SCREAMS THAT THAT CONSUMER EIGHT OR ORGANIZATIONS TRY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS PUT ON THE TABLE AND WHAT'S REALLY BEEN MISSING IS THE INDUSTRY CONVERSATION IN THIS. THEY'RE OPPOSED ANYTHING THAT THAT GETS ATTEMPT AT AND I THINK YOU'RE VULNERABLE TO ALL OF THESE ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING INCLUDING A STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURE. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN LOOK THAT. AS AS A WAY TO SOLVE ALL OF THESE ISSUES AND THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS INTERNET AND CENTER APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE NEVER THIS TO THOSE WHO ARE NOT ENCRYPTING. OR REDACTING INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE CORE ISSUES MOSTLY TRANSACTIONS NOW THAT HAPPENED AND AND ARE ENCRYPTED OR SHOULD BE AND IF THEY'RE NOT. WE'VE WE'VE LEARNED THAT THROUGH THE TARGET BREACH IN THROUGH THROUGH OTHER BRIDGES THAT'S ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE TO DO EVEN AT THAT AT THE CONSUMER READ AND SO THE FACT THAT. UNENCRYPTED DATA IS MOVING. TRANSITIONING BETWEEN FROM ONE SYSTEM TO THE NACS WHATEVER THOSE SYSTEMS HAPPEN TO BE IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR NOW I REALLY TO WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SOME THESE THINGS ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES. SMALL BUSINESSES TYPICALLY THE LARGER THE BUSINESS THE MORE LIKELY THAT THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR ENTIRE PROCESS AND AND THEY'RE GONNA OWN THE SERVERS OR IF NOT THE COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT TROLL OVER THE SERVERS AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE. A SMALLER BUSINESS IS JUST HOSTING THEIR WEBSITE WHERE THEIR DATABASE ESSENTIALLY ON SOMEBODY ELSE'S SERVER THAT SERVER COULD BE POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE IF THERE'S A NOTHER. DATABASE OR WEBSITE HOSTED ON THAT SERVER THAT IS NOT BEING KEPT UP TO DATE THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE APPROPRIATE CORRUPTION. BECAUSE THAT PROVIDES OFTENTIMES AT ENTRY INTO THAT ENTIRE SERVER. SO IF SOMEONE HASN'T MAINTAINED THEIR SOFTWARE HASN'T RUN PATCHES HASN'T KEPT UP WITH IT THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE. POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES TO ANYBODY WHO'S RESIDENT ON THAT SERVER NOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS THE EYES P. SAFE NOT US DUH THOSE WHO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE STATE NOT US THE SMALL BUSINESSES ONCE A NOT AS AND IT. IT'S ALWAYS NOT US WELL THEN WHO AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS BREACH HAS CAUSED THESE DAMAGES TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER JUST THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE THAT THOSE STRESS THE PANIC. HAVING TO GO THROUGH. A CREDIT CHECK HAVING TO GO THROUGH A PROTECT. THEIR INFORMATION EVEN IF THEIR IDENTITY HAD HAS NOT YET BEEN STOLEN. THAT IS SOME BUT THAT IS POTENTIALLY DAMAGES THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT RISE TO THE TO THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND WENT ONE PARTICULAR DATABASES BREACHED THAT'S A SUBSET OF INFORMATION. THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER DATABASE THAT GETS BREACH THAT THAT ADDS TO THE ABILITY ESPECIALLY WITH DATA AGGREGATORS TO THEN GO IN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ENOUGH TO PUT PIECES TOGETHER TO THEN BE ABLE TO GO. AND AND GET A CREDIT CARD IN SOMEBODY'S NAME THE TAX SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER BECAUSE WITH THAT COMBINATION OF DATA FROM TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES NOW THEY HAVE ENOUGH. SO WHO'S THAT RESPONSIBLE WAS THE FIRST BREACH WAS AT THE SECOND GRADE THIS BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT SO UNTIL WE REALLY HAVEN'T. HAD A A BROADER SOLUTION TO THIS THAN. WE'RE GONNA BE LEFT WITH TRYING TO SORT OUT THE BEST WE CAN DO WHICH IS EXACTLY THIS WHICH ARE BILLS LIKE THIS AND TRY TO SET STANDARDS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT. DOING SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS OF THE DATA THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS THEN YES YOU MIGHT BE ON THE HOOK FOR STATUTORY DAMAGES FOR IT. AND AND IF THAT DOESN'T CHANGE BEHAVIOR A I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE WELL. ON THAT JUST BRIEFLY ON THE CHAPTER AND OUT THE THAT DOESN'T CHAPTER GOD AMENDMENTS GET DONE WHEN THERE'S A CONFLICT BETWEEN BILLS SO IF YOU WOULD DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THIS BILL WOULD INTERACT WITH THE BALLOT MEASURE SHOULD IT PASSED. THAT HAVE TO BE TAKEN IN COMMITTEE OR ON THE FLOOR THOSE ARE NOT AMENDMENTS THERE CAN BE DEALT WITH IN CHAPTER GAPS I DON'T BELIEVE THE HOUSES LOOKS A POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURES THAN AND CONFLICTS THERE. IN ORDER TO DRIVE CHAPTER AND OUTSIDE JUST AS A IT'S WELL WORTH LOOKING AT IS THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THOSE. TWO AND WHETHER THERE'S COMPLETE COVERAGE OR NOT I SO FOR ME THIS BILL SATISFIED THIS COMMITTEE I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON TO OTHERS. COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDS THE WORRY IN THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND FOR OTHERS BUT IF NOT THIS THAN WHAT. YOU KNOW IF IF NOT NOW HOW HOW ELSE DO WE PROCESS IS HOW DO WE HAD TO PROVIDE. SOME SECURITY FOR CUSTOMERS THAT THE WEBSITE AS EVERYBODY IS GOING TO DO WITHOUT EVEN THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A DATA BREACH OR THAT THEY'RE PUTTING. SOME OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION OUT TO BE VULNERABLE. THEY'RE GOING TO IT DO YOU DO GOOD AND INTERACT IN THIS WEB OF OF COMMERCE THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE. AND YET THEY'RE THEN GOING TO SUFFER AT SOME. DAMAGE OR CONCERN OR IMPACT IN THEIR LIVES SHOULD THERE BE A BREACH AND I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT ON US. TO LOOK FOR BETTER SOLUTIONS ENSURE THAT WE'VE GOT SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT THAT DRIVES THE BEST DECISIONS AND BEST PRACTICES. FROM THE COMMUNITY ACROSS SUPPORT AND IF A SMALL BUSINESSES WORRIED ABOUT THIS THEY CAN CONTRACT WITH THEIR EYES P. THEY CAN CONTRACT WITH THEIR WEB PROVIDER. TO ENSURE THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PROTECTIONS NECESSARY AND WE WANT TO DRIVE THEM TO THOSE DECISIONS TO PREVENT BREACHES BEFORE THEY EVER REALLY HAPPEN SO SENATOR. YOU MAY CLUBS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION THIS MORNING YOU KNOW I WAS AT A SMALL BUSINESS BAD FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I THOUGHT VERY HARD ABOUT -- THE PROVISIONS THAT YOU KNOW IN IN THIS BILL YELL FRANKLY -- I IT AS I WENT THROUGH I THINK WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND YELL CUSTOMER NAMES AT OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS. BUT WHAT ONE OF THE ONE OF THINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IS FIRST OF ALL WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S FAIR FOR EVERYBODY. AND ONLY THOSE PEOPLE. THAT -- DON'T REASONABLY TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS -- INFORMATION WE'RE NOT. WHAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE THAT -- HAVE BEEN HACKED BY RUSSIAN HACKERS THAT IT IS WAY BETTER THAN THEM THEY DO ALL THAT USE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THAT THAT'S FEASIBLE AT THE TIME BUT THEY JUST GOT BEAT BY SOMEBODY THAT'S BETTER THAN THEM. THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT SEVENTY THAT STEALS A COMPUTER. YELL OUT OF SOMEBODY'S OFFICE IN GAINS AN ADVANTAGE THAT WAY THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING A DOING ANYTHING REASONABLE AND LET'S TALK ABOUT EQUIFAX TAKING A HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT MILLION. I'D IT CAUSING IT TO BE STOLEN AND THEN THERE DIRECTORS. HIDING IT SELLING OFF THEIR SHARES AND I THINK MAYBE SOME OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE NOT ABOUT -- THE HACKING BUT THEY'RE ABOUT -- DIRECTORS NOT DOING THEIR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO OTHER SPECIFIC SHAREHOLDERS -- THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- RIGHT AT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN I HAD THIS IN THE THE SENATE DID A NUMBER OF SENATORS ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT? THE HOPE WOULD YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY I CAN GET THROUGH THE SIDE WHEN I COME BACK THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE SAFE HARBORS. THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE -- YOU KNOW SOME THINGS THAT THE THAT MAKETHIS BILL MORE FAIR -- OR UNDERSTANDABLE NOT BE OUT OF CONTROL ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS AS YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SO I WOULD LIKE -- TO YA INVITE THE INDUSTRY -- THAT IS OPPOSING THIS BILL IF THEY'VE GOT SOME IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS BILL BETTER FOR CONSUMERS.
