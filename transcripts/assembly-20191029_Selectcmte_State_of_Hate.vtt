00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:46.832
sadly ended and deadly violence.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:47.332
Modern white supremacist

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:47.933
ideology is centered on the

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.736
assertion that the white race

00:17:50.803 --> 00:17:52.905
is in danger of extinction

00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.840
found a rising tide not quite

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:56.375
people who are controlled and

00:17:56.442 --> 00:18:00.679
manipulated by Jews. A white

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:01.346
supremacist believe that almost

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:04.149
any action is justified if it

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:04.716
will help to save the white

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:12.124
race. The hard to speak- but

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:14.059
sometimes it's hard to speak-

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:16.428
in accurate terms about some of

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:16.995
the things going on in our

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:20.499
country now after the twenty

00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:20.966
sixteen election white

00:18:21.033 --> 00:18:24.670
supremacists- which also

00:18:24.736 --> 00:18:28.474
frequently known as the all

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.375
right- but grew. Our on line

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:34.313
active them through and with

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:34.813
group in order is in. In

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:41.787
tactics such targeting. College

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:42.387
campuses like the one we're on

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.623
today. The all right also

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.157
expanded to its propaganda

00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:47.459
efforts through tactics like

00:18:47.526 --> 00:18:49.628
podcasting in world of online

00:18:49.695 --> 00:18:53.999
games where. Are they targeted

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:54.666
an influence young

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:58.604
impressionable individuals. Our

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.204
who were listening and readily

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.574
of. Audience violence and crime

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.676
represent the most serious

00:19:04.743 --> 00:19:05.244
problems emanating from the

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:06.211
white supremacist movement

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:09.515
white supremacists have killed

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:10.082
more people in recent years

00:19:10.148 --> 00:19:12.417
than any type of domestic

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:15.220
extremist fifty for of all

00:19:15.287 --> 00:19:17.656
domestic. Stream is related

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:22.661
murders- of all. Stream related

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:26.398
murders. Of them were committed

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:33.305
by white supremacists. And this

00:19:33.372 --> 00:19:34.506
is not just people who have

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:38.310
adopted this as an ideology it

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:40.345
is also who are influenced by

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.281
the ideology- or by the

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:47.653
rhetoric and so- I just this

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:48.453
past weekend we serve the one

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.923
year anniversary of the tree of

00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:52.291
life synagogue attack that

00:19:52.357 --> 00:19:55.093
occurred in suburban Pittsburgh

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.398
where eight people were killed-

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:00.766
the LA perpetrator of that

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:04.670
process he- was found to have

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:09.474
white now. List directly on.

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:10.008
His cell hard drive on his

00:20:10.075 --> 00:20:17.849
computer. Murmurs in terror

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:18.483
plots represent only this guy's

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.652
got a of this kind of file. As

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.487
there are many more pensive.

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:25.090
That may have ended in by.

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:26.525
Including attempted murders

00:20:26.592 --> 00:20:28.727
thoughts weapons and explosive

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:29.261
violence but they didn't.

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.963
Because I are at law

00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:32.397
enforcement was able to get

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.566
their first in addition white

00:20:34.633 --> 00:20:37.035
supremacists engaged in a lot

00:20:37.102 --> 00:20:39.304
of non ideological. Including

00:20:39.371 --> 00:20:40.906
crimes of violence women and

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:44.543
drug related crimes. Well these

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.578
groups represent only a small.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:52.150
A small. The overall population

00:20:52.217 --> 00:20:54.753
they are not in sick again in

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.154
their influence and are

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:56.788
becoming increasingly ticketed

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:58.390
and organized in some cases

00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:00.492
they have formed alliances and

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:01.126
created umbrella organizations

00:21:01.193 --> 00:21:02.094
is the national front they have

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:02.694
changed their parents to seem

00:21:02.761 --> 00:21:06.264
more professional and rebranded

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:06.798
their organizations with

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:10.636
adopted names like the national

00:21:10.702 --> 00:21:13.772
policy institute to appear more

00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:15.774
academic. An effort to change

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.844
the political landscape they

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.478
have created political is like

00:21:19.544 --> 00:21:20.178
the American Freedom Party to

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:24.383
elect local state and national

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:28.353
candidates and it is. That

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.555
their mission is to infiltrate

00:21:30.622 --> 00:21:32.924
the mainstream and attack

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:35.961
American values. So what do we

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:36.528
do how do we slow down this

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:37.195
proliferation how do we diffuse

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:39.698
this growing type of hate how

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:42.901
can we bounce free speech with

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:43.502
incendiary hate speech on so I

00:21:43.568 --> 00:21:48.106
made yeah. As it is in our

00:21:48.173 --> 00:21:50.542
thirties how do we prepare our

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:51.076
communities to be able to

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:55.247
handle potential for taste.

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:56.381
Hosting hearings says these.

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:56.948

00:38:56.634 --> 00:39:00.871
who worked in. This graph as

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:01.472
well and James known as region

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:12.216
universe. No. Work for. To see

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:30.534
what this okay to. Select text.

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:34.872
Look. We're trying to do the

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:40.411
now just. Some kind of action.

00:39:40.478 --> 00:39:46.383
With extreme is the tux. This

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.786
is all coming at a time in the

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:52.456
U. S. elation person. And also

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:56.727
coming. I went and social

00:39:56.794 --> 00:40:02.366
pollute. The youngest

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.000
demographic is the one that's

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.635
diversifying the most from the

00:40:04.702 --> 00:40:06.403
most recent shootings that we

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.606
see in mass shootings Gilroy

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:10.775
which we have in the church

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:14.345
exactly what that one is but if

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.480
you look at power when you look

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:20.684
at el Paso. But. Did have. Five

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.620
up quite significantly recently

00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:26.524
I am the youngest court is

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:32.129
group that is. The first single.

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:32.663
So the one that's the most

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.198
aren't except for. It

00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:36.700
radicalized on the internet we

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:37.334
see the sea change used to be

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:38.803
the organized groups like Nash

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:40.504
George was moving now wishing

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:42.339
smaller groups with shorter

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:44.341
help lives to more violent and

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:46.343
we're also seeing the do it

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:46.844
yourselfer come from an

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:50.915
ecosystem. Of hate that they

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:51.448
find on a buffet from the

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:52.683
internet. This is the

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.520
diversification United States.

00:40:56.587 --> 00:41:00.424
Now the minor party. This is.

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:06.363
Tuitions. Continued multi Gen

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:18.843
thanks to. Hold us to get. What.

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:27.184
All politically were show up.

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:27.718
The polarization and we're

00:41:27.785 --> 00:41:28.185
getting engaged in the

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:31.422
political process. And one

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.123
things have to be sure. Is

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.591
there seems to be some

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:41.165
correlation. Catalytic pull all

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.166
of that troll or election day

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:46.136
after let twenty sixteen the

00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:46.770
worst day for hate crime going.

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:53.010
Up D. C. two thousand three and

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:54.511
it was also a time of a plot to

00:41:54.578 --> 00:42:01.452
blow up. Apartment gardens.

00:42:01.518 --> 00:42:02.119
What we saw on assassination of

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:05.189
a member of parliament taxed so

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:07.324
we're trying to find out or the

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:14.098
signal literature we make some.

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:14.732
For research well policy policy

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:26.443
makers law. Well brown. 75%

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.147
Protect what last plan.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.950
Research. On does with the

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:42.526
signs. Also nine. Shop all

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:50.467
right. This is what we see what.

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:55.239
Later. One interfere okay what

00:42:55.306 --> 00:43:00.778
is this. He was. Committee

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:16.060
minority time. The run twenty.

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:19.930
We need to step up and take

00:43:19.997 --> 00:43:22.599
measures to protect our

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:24.301
elections from interference. A

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:31.308
plus là. More today than my

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:36.880
twenty years. So this. One

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:44.555
thing for you for over. Two one

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:50.461
on the stuff to. About twenty

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.896
five years ago opens anyway. He

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.099
looks older bomb this is from

00:43:55.165 --> 00:44:01.472
government. That. Two right

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:05.342
right wing. Direct not children

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:12.416
okay. This is. Relation of the

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:16.186
right wing so a Los Europe.

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:18.689
What's happening this thing

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.657
just bear with me on this look

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.726

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:30.667
Good will. Right very pleased.

00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:34.738
We will twenty the latest data.

Okay well. In a year we were

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:49.119
seeing. White supremacist white

00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:54.224
now. Rally in the two years

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.293
leading just into an after

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.964
Charlottesville on the previous.

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:03.600
To try to get me stream one

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:07.471
tamp down but if. For instance.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:11.975
Lose our into one. Other chart

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:17.214

00:45:17.281 --> 00:45:17.714
about two years would to

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:20.517
celebrate. And look what

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:21.685
candidate Obama was about to

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:24.488
win October two three eight

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.156

November twenty sixteen so

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:30.761
trying to analyze that. You're

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:43.340

shooter a year ago. He

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.198
understood the guard because he

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:10.801

looked a big. In the region and

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:58.582
I this might be a week. Still

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:04.254
to lose power more. Some other

they tried to set up their own

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:16.406
sites do the same thing. In

00:56:16.473 --> 00:56:18.675
addition the largest social

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:19.175

have a closer look at their own

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:26.583
rules and began removing white

00:56:26.649 --> 00:56:30.653
nationalist postings. This has

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.622
moved many but not all the

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.457
white nationalist sites in the

00:56:34.524 --> 00:56:36.693
individual. To turn platform to

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.628
be on the screen well this is

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:40.730
our in many que is echo

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.499
chambers them so also you

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:43.133
present a danger. After to the

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:45.001
deadly event listed the

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:48.304
previous law. These it's rob

00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:54.377
with adult. Urgent for us to

00:56:54.444 --> 00:57:00.583
take action. A host of no less.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.151
No less violence in smaller

00:57:01.217 --> 00:57:02.452
groups in loan actors have

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:04.687
sprung up in the past few years

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:06.489

movement and the prop boys

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:16.499
scribe cells as well. In this

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:18.501
part of something. That we all

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.336
right is this. Man is fear.

00:57:20.403 --> 00:57:20.937
Interesting enough others have

00:57:21.004 --> 00:57:26.342
described. This group as as a

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:26.910
multi racial white supremacy

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:30.513
group. Because they have they

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.649
have- tried to change their

00:57:32.715 --> 00:57:34.083
image and even have used a

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.719
front man from one of their-

00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.121
one of their divisions that is

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:40.490
an African American but the

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.057
philosophy still remains the

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:44.561
same. Two final category so

00:57:44.627 --> 00:57:45.161
like to draw your attention to

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:18.862
In addition game which makes

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:22.699
available. Why which were used

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:24.500
in the in the recent attack on

00:58:24.567 --> 00:58:26.402
the synagogue in Halle Germany

00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:26.970
just this past year on could

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:30.306
pour. And live streaming was

00:58:30.373 --> 00:58:32.408
also used in Christ in the

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:33.009
Christchurch attack and would

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.544
have been used in the PO a

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.446
synagogue attack except they

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:36.980

glitch the social network

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.085
providers inability an apparent

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:42.685
lack of interest in solving

00:58:42.752 --> 00:58:46.055
this issue despite calls from

00:58:46.122 --> 00:58:48.258
the Simon Wiesenthal center and

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:48.825
others is both glaring. And

00:58:48.892 --> 00:58:52.929
unacceptable. This is just one

00:58:52.996 --> 00:59:05.975
one. A. Truck games or at night.

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:06.476
The most popular games a

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:08.378
popular game in two thousand

white nationalist and Islamic

00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:20.423
terrorists with impunity. On

instantaneous contact with

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.729
white supremacists and even

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:30.466
ISIS figures in Syria. Just

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.489
attention to the subject of

01:00:26.556 --> 01:00:28.725
hate as a state we need to

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:29.258
increase our awareness and

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:30.293
monitoring and force our

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.528
existing laws and determine

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.263
where we make might. Be digital

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.200
progress. The internet has

01:00:37.266 --> 01:00:38.601
become the fuel that powers

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.303
much of the hate and violence

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.770
resulting from white

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:42.372
nationalist ideology. To this

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.340
end the Simon Wiesenthal

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:46.275
center's created a program to

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:48.244
discuss the perils of social

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:48.911
networking with middle and high

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.813
school students. Been able to

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.248
make this program available in

01:00:52.315 --> 01:00:54.450
southern California through a

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:58.221
cal yes grant. Piloting

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:58.788
preventing violent extremism

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.490
programs. We need to continue

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:04.460
to repeat such. We need to

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:06.629
continue to reach young people

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:07.296
in this manner in the hope that

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:08.531
we can avert them from. A full

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.098
activity in the future thank

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:16.372
you. Thank you very much next

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.208
up we have deputy sheriff Greg

01:01:19.275 --> 01:01:21.277
Jones the community liaison

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:24.280
with the San Bernardino county

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.482
sheriff's department to keep us

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:27.116
a long term perspective on this

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:36.559
issue. Thank you very much.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:42.131
Hello okay. Thank you very much.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:42.765
I would like this I would like

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.434
to think because these

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:44.901
aboriginal and all the

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:48.304
Assemblymembers. And are

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:50.473
senator center Roth- and also

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.341
the pay for this opportunity- I

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.410
represent assembly you know

01:01:54.477 --> 01:01:56.279
county department ensure John

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:56.879
it man. And it was a pleasure

01:01:56.946 --> 01:02:00.083
to be here. My perspective from

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:04.020
this a little bit different.

01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:04.620
Which you just heard what you

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.155
just seen is extremely in

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.758
detail- it's very this topic is

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.993
very very happy it's a hard

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.363
topic to talk about- it's one

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.964
of those things that being in

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.466
the community liaison. Where

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.066
are county I hate always comes

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:22.405
up. Always comes up it is a

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:23.005
discussion that is definitely

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.309
need to be had. You may not

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:26.809
want to talk about it is

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:30.913
definitely needed. And the only

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.081
way to talk about it is in a

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:35.084
former this so like to thank

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:38.221
you. I really want to get to.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.289
And explain from a personal

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.258
standpoint- when law

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:42.892
enforcement response to calls

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:46.429
for service- we don't always

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.631
see- what in and in the end I

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:52.401
season. Tom what we see some

01:02:52.468 --> 01:02:54.103
more likely as a hate incident.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:56.806
Individuals have a freedom of

01:02:56.873 --> 01:02:58.374
speech regardless of how an

01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:58.975
individual may or may not feel

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:02.845
about it. The hard part is

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:03.412
investigating hate crimes as

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:08.217
all. One of the key incidences

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.520
that to be a crime. I'm gonna

01:03:10.586 --> 01:03:12.221
go through my presentation is

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.023
not as long as my counterparts.

01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:16.259
I just wanna give you a very

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:16.893
brief understanding because I'm

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.628
very interested to hear from.

01:03:18.694 --> 01:03:25.067
Jeff. One of the thanks of hate

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.802
crime it has to be within the

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:31.040
seven in the Decatur. Hate

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.575
crime mean to cut back in order.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:36.946
Our part because. Receive so

01:03:37.013 --> 01:03:40.883
the big. Yes nationality rate

01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:48.791
at the. Region's Tory Xin. The

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:52.995
per room. More of these actual

01:03:53.062 --> 01:03:54.163
seat the rest. And the heart.

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:57.433
That's the hard part. When it

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.835
comes we see a lot of hate

01:03:59.902 --> 01:04:00.469
these days in the media. We see

01:04:00.536 --> 01:04:03.973
a lot of it on the net. And

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.945
also the state level- whether

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:09.579
you're on one side of the party

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:12.949
or the- party. These are really

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.482
part are cut our county or

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.618
state or. You don't have a look

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:20.723
see hate. When we get hate. We

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.157
within one of these

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:24.860
characteristics. The difference

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:25.494
is when someone there is a hate

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:29.198
incident. It's either if all

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:36.606
under. Hey by. This will

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:42.511
protect other person right most.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:43.112
Examples include in calling in

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:46.749
Salt. But it's just being hate

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:49.452
real in a public place. Meeting

01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:52.788
bill on your own prop. In this

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:55.625
room alone. How many

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:59.195
individuals have been a victim.

01:04:59.262 --> 01:05:02.565
I hate incident the going back.

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.768
So if you really think back

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:06.369
everyone has been a victim of

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.003
it in support of some type. And

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:12.875
it affects everyone. When it

01:05:12.942 --> 01:05:14.577
comes a speech the first clip.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:18.547
The issue with that is. Speech

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:22.485
protect most speech. We just

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:23.052
three of the if the for her

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:29.158
words. The speech number two.

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:34.630
Right perjury black I'm in.

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:40.469
Section can see. In within say

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:45.174
like how do we are confined to

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:45.708
education within our law

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.209
enforcement officers are law

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:49.779
enforcement health standardize

01:05:49.845 --> 01:06:04.160
Bob hope's piece all. Was gonna.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:08.531
Our training is my post. Like

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:14.904
most states in the in state.

01:06:14.970 --> 01:06:28.484
The our prisons. Some go. Under

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.886
the guidelines. It's the same

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:31.454
throughout the entire United

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.023
States. It's not. We're very

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.759
forty. Every off to me go to

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.928
training we what we get the

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:39.495
necessary information. From

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:42.631
post. We received

01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.232
approximately- right now it's

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:46.969
twenty four weeks of. Within

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.771
those four weeks we have

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.172
approximately two hours the

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.942
deals will culture per city.

01:06:53.008 --> 01:06:56.746
Implicit bias. Within that we

01:06:56.812 --> 01:07:00.549
recognize that the culture-

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:00.983
within the cal thing

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.451
California's pass if you. We

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:06.889
look at. So what's for our

01:07:06.956 --> 01:07:10.659
enemy in for every person see

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:12.695
our camp to our enemies every a

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:16.665
and C. we even have outside

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:20.569
agencies riverside county.

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.571
Agencies north with me. We're

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.642
trying to. Negative. If

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:30.679
somebody actually. Or the right

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:32.782
I'm it with it. Taking that

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.483
into the six months almost

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:38.387
impossible. So when we come

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.054
across with the public and they

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:40.589
want to express that their a

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:44.093
victim of a hate. It's our

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:44.560
responsibility in law

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.462
enforcement. To give an

01:07:46.529 --> 01:07:48.197
understanding of what hate it

01:07:48.264 --> 01:07:50.533
hate speech or hate crime maps.

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:54.370
We should now. The hard part is

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:54.837
our officers are very

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.541
challenged. It's not an excuse

01:07:58.607 --> 01:08:00.609
at all but I do need to make a

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.678
very clear and hopefully we can

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.245
understand that include our

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:06.715
panel. That when it comes to

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.384
culture diversity. We're given

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:12.221
a lot information. But not just

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:12.822
like everyone here has been

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:14.290
affected by hate of hate speech

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:16.625
I hate incident it's not clear

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.194
when it comes a law. For one it

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:18.761
has to be a violation of the

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:26.635
law. When we go back. When it

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:30.639
comes I hate crimes we are

01:08:30.706 --> 01:08:31.273
taught laws related take Raimes

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:36.946
does. Related impact of crime

01:08:37.012 --> 01:08:40.182
best get in documentation. We

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:46.388
are trying to the site. The

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.022
initial investigation is not by

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:50.392
an officer or a deputy. I'll go

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:52.828
to the law to a scene doses of

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.997
the church Gen. They will get a

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.665
good treatment for council or

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.834
whatever is needed. We have. We

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:03.138
will. But the basic investigate

01:09:03.205 --> 01:09:04.240
is all basic education. Is

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:12.381
hammer the lowest also a- is it.

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:16.185
It will be. Eight cation

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:20.823
bearable. Mason the detective

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.258
FOR investigator will look at

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:22.858
in a raven enough information

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.093
from disability the tender

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.328
nationality race religion

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.264
sexual orientation association

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.966
with the person group of one or

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:31.433
more of the perceived

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.537
characteristics. From now will

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.137
look at the local playgroups.

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:38.607
Look at the local organizations

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:39.308
we'll look at the patterns that

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.376
are being developed within our

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:41.944
our our sister agencies

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.747
surrounding counties. Their

01:09:44.813 --> 01:09:46.048
crimes have been committed well

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.684
look the patterns- we are very

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:52.154
fortunate that our department

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:52.688
as part of a regional task

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:56.659
force. That task force- is made

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:59.261
up of multiple agencies within

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:02.197
southern area. We meet

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:02.665
quarterly at the anti

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.967
defamation league. We meet with

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:08.137
other individuals- I can't go

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.973
into detail all the different

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:11.574
agencies because some of that

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.578
is confidential. But I can't

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:16.145
tell you that our regional

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:18.714
partners. Some of the liaisons

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:22.585
are with the FBI. Sometimes we

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:24.620
were on a local. Sometimes

01:10:24.687 --> 01:10:30.492
group like a group that Jeff.

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:32.795
For the national. A lot of the

01:10:32.861 --> 01:10:33.329
hit happens within our own

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:35.030
state in a rural county. This

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.765
is are coming from the area. It

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:40.536
is very deceiving. I was

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:41.136
looking at the city it's with

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:47.009
you to. I've. I was very aye

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:47.643
right that is Lara county it's

01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:48.344
not always over twenty thousand

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.479
square miles for this year

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:51.947
alone we've only documented

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:54.750
seven hate crimes. This year.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.652
Last year was twenty. So the

01:10:56.719 --> 01:11:00.222
question comes up. The

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:02.858
reporting for the team's not

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.126
wanting to be victims they

01:11:04.193 --> 01:11:06.762
afraid or the exchange is under

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:10.399
reporting is it on the Japanese

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:10.899
or the officer side is a

01:11:10.966 --> 01:11:14.336
training or experience. This is

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:18.607
just phone the number a little-

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:24.613
but said of the tax. This is

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.180
this for now this is our our

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:32.321
alone. It is how do we about

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:34.823
hate crime how do we truly

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.825
investigated is it a hate

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:40.329
speech Hey incident. We do it

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:44.500
has crime. A lot Hey there were

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.969
saying is starting at the

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:49.238
university at the university

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:49.805
level a lot of his to social

01:11:49.872 --> 01:11:53.542
media. Live it is to the gaming

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:54.743
systems. A lot of his on the

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.879
national level. It's not hard

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:57.446
to find a hate group of some

01:11:57.513 --> 01:12:00.282
type. Issue with. You have

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.284
individuals going seeking out

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.453
individuals who feel like

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.087
they're being pushed aside. In

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.155
their grooming them. It's

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:16.198
starting in the schools. One of

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:18.167
the aspects of the way one

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:18.734
person is handling the their

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.536
hate crimes is that we're

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.571
taking a deeper look into what

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.707
is what is the ultimatum or

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:25.307
what is the actual what is the

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.442
evidential. What is at the root

01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:32.314
of the issue. If you feel the

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:32.915
been a victim were you know a

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.650
victim please report it. I

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.852
cannot stress that enough I

01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:38.420
would have to think that we

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:42.091
have more hate crimes in just

01:12:42.157 --> 01:12:42.624
five or seven with our own

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.393
county. If you're from outside

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.462
county like riverside or Los

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:49.131
Angeles. Sometimes we look at

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.165
certain counties is with more

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:52.968
of a population. But if it is

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:55.871
room alone if we've had many

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:56.438
individuals been affected by

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:57.673
hate. Think about all the

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.676
individuals who are not.

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:01.276
Because they don't want to be

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:02.711
percent they don't want to be

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.613
on social media. They don't

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.782
want to be verbally and there

01:13:06.849 --> 01:13:12.554
can be verbally attacked. About

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.189
casein investigating hate

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:18.527
crimes. They're very hard very

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.395
hard to prove. Look at the

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:24.366
intention. The larger ones were

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.735
the other rallies and you have

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.437
somebody putting a truck

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:29.071
through a group of individuals

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:32.841
the easy to investigate it's a

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:34.943
motivated that person to kill

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:35.577
somebody did not look like them

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:38.480
because of eight. Park ones is

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.049
if you have in our county the

01:13:41.116 --> 01:13:44.820
which with the incident. On a

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.688
school bus where you have kids

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:47.322
who hanging a noose. Outside of

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.791
a school bus. Driving down the

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:55.097
road. It's eight is children so

01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:56.799
what do we don't want. We start

01:13:56.865 --> 01:14:02.971
with educate. With with going

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:03.539
out talking visuals we meet

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.174
with Burke. We meet with

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.975
individual that may not agree

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:08.811
with us meet with groups that

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:12.614
made that. I'll be with us. But

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:13.215
we need each and everyone of

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:16.185
you when you see something is

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.887
not a slogan we see something

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:20.556
say something. Become part of

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:25.060
the change we need your help.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.295
We need every is assembly

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.430
members help because we have a

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:32.201
closet thank change. Done

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:32.835
because nobody's ever feel like

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:36.905
a victim. No reserve right I

01:14:36.972 --> 01:14:37.472
can't report something or I

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:40.142

assembly thank you very much.

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.845
Where to talk a little bit

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.014
about- the start out with

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:22.584
inside right national. Look it

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:26.521
by not is America this. This

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:40.636
I'm was. Two years ago. Seven

01:15:40.702 --> 01:15:41.203
thousand seventeen. Actually

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:48.343
some. This just. I'd like to

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:50.245
apologize to the local

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.080
community for- depart my

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:56.184
organization had in. Some of

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:56.785
the incidents that took place

01:15:56.852 --> 01:16:06.261
here over the years. It's not

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:09.998
easy to get up here and after

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:10.532
twenty seven years in the

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.567
movement to admit that you were

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.336
wrong that- the life that you

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:18.173
lived. My entire adult life was

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.008
wrong in in correctional so-

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.277
here with me a little bit of

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:24.379
from- slow in the- delivery of

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.148
the speaking here you know I

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.350
spoke for many years in the

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:30.319
national socialist movement and

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:32.120
I can tell you. I don't all

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:34.423
those years this is probably

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.224
one of the hardest speeches-

01:16:36.291 --> 01:16:40.095
I've ever had to give because-

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:40.662
it's not easy to admit one's

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:46.201
wrong with. For the past so

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:50.138
let's move on here. In the

01:16:50.205 --> 01:16:52.140
early years- just like to tell

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.009
you a little bit about my story

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:54.643
and- where I come from and all

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.413
and so on so you can kind of

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.115
get an idea the public can kind

01:17:00.182 --> 01:17:02.217
of get an idea of where how

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:02.784
people get involved in this

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:06.655
movement and- going forward

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.790
from that- that's me as a as a

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:12.494
small child. And so we all

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:18.633
start out like this. Yeah this

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.537
is a- one. Of my people that.

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:23.105
Are we're all human in a lot

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:28.243
time see. I think out in the

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:30.012
outside world because of Haiti

01:17:30.078 --> 01:17:32.748
because the nasty things that a

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.383
white. Man has done- especially

01:17:34.449 --> 01:17:35.017
some of the horrible incidents

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.418
like we have we heard about

01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:38.286
here today like the synagogue

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.022
shootings the mosque shootings

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:40.622
and stuff like that. I think

01:17:40.689 --> 01:17:44.126
it's easy to dehumanize people-

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:46.228
and so to realize or or to

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:48.430
believe that- we're not dealing

01:17:48.497 --> 01:17:52.134
with human beings here so- at

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.102
the risk of coming off as an

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.703
apologist for these people I

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:58.140
certainly am not that but I

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:00.175
want people to understand that-

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.010
you know this is a this is a

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:04.112
two way street and someone

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:04.713
explain kind of how. And why I

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:10.685
join the movement. Can't see

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:11.253
this picture very well this

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:11.887
looks like a rally I think this

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:14.656
is here in California. I also

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.925
want to. Get into a little bit

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:20.762
of a cop deal. People to move a

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:26.101
lot of. That. All this is about.

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:28.603
Do you eight some I can tell

01:18:28.670 --> 01:18:29.271
you some I come from a middle

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.439
class home I didn't have a

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.374
story like a lot of the other

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:34.342
performers do where they were

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:34.943
beaten up they were bullied

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.711
they came from all one family-

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.380
home- they had all these

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:40.549
problems with drugs or or her

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.384
struggles and things like that

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.286
I came from a very good decent.

01:18:44.352 --> 01:18:46.555
Normal middle class family and

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:48.223
I got brought into this

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:50.125
movement I was in this movement

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:54.196
until. March of this year. Is

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.098
so people can come from all

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:56.698
walks of life and get involved

01:18:56.765 --> 01:19:02.204
in this sort of thing. Com. So

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:06.675
there's me again. This was a

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.743
long time ago. Nineteen ninety.

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:18.687
And Rick. Find find common now

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.789

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:24.759
ample religion. The US and

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.864

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.066
idea and we I mean to the point

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:34.669

at one Civic we tarp that you

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:40.175
think could. Up specific things

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:40.809
like religion. And give them an

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.410
identity which says that the

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:43.044
white race is the chosen people

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:46.248

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:48.216
came to us and said you know-

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.385

raped by somebody of another

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:54.089
race we would play on that we

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:54.689
would we would focus on that

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.525
issue because once they're in

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:58.360
there and then some of the

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:00.362
other things that. Maybe they

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.397
didn't agree with or didn't

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.065
understand everything. If we

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:06.635
get him in the door we get him

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:07.202
in the door that's all or

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:08.303
that's all we were trying to

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.405
DO. Hatreds so someone came to

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.073
us and said they don't like

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:12.674
black people or they didn't

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.242
like Jews you know we would

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:14.743
expound on that we had

01:20:14.809 --> 01:20:16.044
literature specifically

01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:18.146
tailored to all of those

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:18.713
different things whether it

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.150
was- crimes between the races

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.052
whether it was the Jewish

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:25.954
question whether it was. God

01:20:26.021 --> 01:20:28.123
that was saying it's religion

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:28.723
we had things that were based

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:30.091
on all these different things.

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.227
Then through recruitment we did

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.329
it I mean every aspect

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:35.931
everything you can imagine.

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:38.400
From video games from music.

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:41.036
From leaflets to podcast I

01:20:41.102 --> 01:20:42.571
think the national socialist

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:47.142
movement now even today has

01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:48.743
probably five podcasts a week-

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.445
which- to video games in the

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.248
last few years. Hello all kinds

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:58.787
of different. Basically. To

01:20:58.853 --> 01:20:59.387
combat these type things what

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:02.591
we need to do is. Some no bill.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.426
And you saw those things

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.094
because once people get all in

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:06.695
this and I keep saying I don't

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:10.732
like to. Cult but in a lot of

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.767
ways it is like a call because

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:15.337
you are you living life in sort

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:18.607
of a bubble. And you don't see

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:19.241
outside that bubble life is so

01:21:19.307 --> 01:21:22.143
much different from me now

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.645
because I'm outside a bubble

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.881
like it's like a whole new life.

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:27.549
Group of human beings like when

01:21:27.616 --> 01:21:31.987
you were in the movement. You

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.090
are in your mind is closed-

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:35.690
many different things. I was I

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:38.660
was top story on the way over

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.096
here. Another guy that had

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:41.696
gotten item is a year before I

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:44.599
didn't. You know my sound crazy

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:50.605
to be. When I holding for first.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:53.475
Look around where that is the

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:56.645
another race we talked I see

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:58.680
that today and I think. That's

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.982
the time. Was that we had a

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:06.755
most. That is the. It's just

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.823
only battle just like a small

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:12.827
act of kindness that normal

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:13.428
right you know I didn't see it

01:22:13.495 --> 01:22:19.200
was things. My. I want to draw

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:24.139
off my experience improvement

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:36.151
and doing now. Here I believe.

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:42.557
And I know a lot of hello. That

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:43.158
sort of thing speak this sort

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:45.560
of thing is pretty easy. In the

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.762
movement when you leave your

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:49.698
hair like originally I just

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:50.231
retired from the movement

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.666
that's that's easy you can

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:55.870
retire. No big deal. When you

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:56.471
start speaking out and do this

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:59.441
sort of. They look at that as

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:02.110
if you are the worst kind of.

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:02.711
The worst kind of in the tool

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.913
bar. When I dropped my

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:05.413
experience my knowledge

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.650
movement. How they think the

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.819
psychology of that why they do

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.854
what do to combat this. And to

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:16.291
help this is my way of giving

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:19.327
back- for a lot of people that

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:22.430
question sincerity. Why am why

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:27.102
I'm doing this sort of thing.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:27.736
We put for me or mental state I

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:28.269
was that I knew what I was

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:32.807
doing. In in this world in a

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:34.342
sense of how to do the work

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.811
business tied in with this

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:44.285
every I knew. Because this was.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:47.288
I was doing for all those years

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:47.922
was on I knew was wrong to go.

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:54.095
But I get out. Why. Because it

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.530
was easy a stock- like a guy

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.967
that that's working at a terror

01:23:59.033 --> 01:24:01.236
that he hates everyday and just

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:06.608
keeps doing doing in. I'm not.

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:07.208
That I'm ashamed to say it but

01:24:07.275 --> 01:24:13.114
it's true. It will be easier to

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.682
stay where I was at why I

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:17.385
didn't stay any longer is like.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:20.555
That was coming violence that

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:22.757
was already happening and the

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.592
violence that's to calm if we

01:24:24.659 --> 01:24:25.193
don't. Come back there in the

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:32.801
correct manner. And drop. My

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:33.401
experience at this when I talk

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:42.477
to you station. In this way

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.646
state and that that's a one I

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:45.246
didn't even know number years

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:58.460
ago. Like this and having a

01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:00.328
conversation trying to- expound

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:02.530
the- ideology I'm assuming of

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:06.367
the movement. He was knocked

01:25:06.434 --> 01:25:08.336
out on the street and people

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:10.271
were laughing and they filmed

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.140
it and kind of walking over him

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:12.807
I think people might have been

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:16.344
spitting on him and filming it

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.246
nobody help this young man. So

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:18.847
at the time when I was in the

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:20.448
movement and we use videos like

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.517
this all the time to you know.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.385
Promote our cause and save like

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:26.020
what we were doing was right.

01:25:26.087 --> 01:25:28.490
When I join the movement I

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.158
thought I was doing what was

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:30.792
right I thought I was standing

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:32.560
up for my people. And that's

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:33.161
what a lot of the people that

01:25:33.228 --> 01:25:34.496
are involved in that their

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:36.264
idealists. They believe they're

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:38.066
standing up for their people

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:38.700
that's why this is going to be

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:40.535
a hard thing to break. They're

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.337
not joining a because they just

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:44.205
blindly hate. Me there is those

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.107
types in there too. But I'm

01:25:46.174 --> 01:25:46.708
saying for me personally and

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.243
for a lot of the people that I

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:50.178
knew. It was about ideology it

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:50.812
was about. Trying to save the

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:54.082
white race as we reckon and

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:54.716
some of the other panelists of

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:57.185
kind of- touch upon here the

01:25:57.252 --> 01:26:04.058
thinking of these guys- in

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:04.526
that. So under the de

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:14.369
humanization subject. Gene this

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.003
young man treated like that in

01:26:15.069 --> 01:26:18.439
a lot of people don't. Gosh why.

01:26:18.506 --> 01:26:19.073
Steal so for the for this guide

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:22.243
I got knocked out in the street.

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:28.216
Because at the time.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:34.489
Minimization of I. But now

01:26:34.556 --> 01:26:47.969
since. I see that wow. A white

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.170
person when they couldn't see

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:50.905
the teaching in a the de

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.540
humanization of so many others.

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.742
You see not that we- didn't

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.878
come to me until out. Until

01:26:56.945 --> 01:26:58.980
after I had time to. Decompress

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.616
my mind in fiscally look back

01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:02.817
and go wow you know I could see

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.086
the human is a of this guy. The

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:08.289
structure that I didn't. Being

01:27:08.356 --> 01:27:10.558
somewhat that propagated hate

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:12.460
and- intolerance and all this

01:27:12.527 --> 01:27:13.027
sort of thing for all these

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:15.163
years I didn't see that did you

01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.763
realization of all those other

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:20.168
people. See it now. That's why

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:23.871
I feel like there's hope. For

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:31.112
all of us if we can. Hey. In

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:34.649
the photo on the left. A rally

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:36.351
that's me there's being with.

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:40.588
Yes ma'am. Other groups that.

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:48.696
Thank you thousands. On right.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:56.871
Marla by default. Yeah that's.

01:27:56.938 --> 01:27:59.440
It's a it's a psych hate

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:04.612
reading violent. Island see a

01:28:04.679 --> 01:28:06.447
Peavey is as one of things I

01:28:06.514 --> 01:28:09.017
work with now- which profit

01:28:09.083 --> 01:28:10.618
called networks that happens

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:14.389
people leave of various forms

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:15.990
of extreme some extremism can

01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:18.393
come in many forms- is not just

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:22.830
the far right. The far left is

01:28:22.897 --> 01:28:24.399
up here- G. hot of mints and

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:26.701
other types of extremism. We

01:28:26.768 --> 01:28:28.403
see it whether it's gang

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.872
members or or- all the

01:28:30.938 --> 01:28:33.875
different kinds of extremism

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:35.443
anti far far right jihadi a

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:38.246
Muslim extremist. Types of

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:40.415
extremists- when they leave

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:48.556
wrong period. So I'm this this

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:49.123
is what I should had up here

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:52.927
okay we have. It may be item

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.964
we've that basis for it Bob in

01:28:57.031 --> 01:29:04.539
sum up. Any yeah okay others

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:06.841
may find some I know that. Okay

01:29:06.908 --> 01:29:09.043
on the right today but felt it

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.644
is important to point out the

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:12.814
other forms of extreme because

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.381
they are all up dangerous.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:18.686
Polarization. Stream question

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:22.790
understanding hi. I know that

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:28.396
hard pill to swallow. But if.

01:29:28.463 --> 01:29:30.665
One of one of the most of it is

01:29:30.732 --> 01:29:34.402
that that I've seen getting a

01:29:34.469 --> 01:29:34.969
number of other people are.

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.537
With you when I. And I've

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:40.241
brought people a few from other

01:29:40.308 --> 01:29:42.543
position if you were

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:43.111
independence and people from

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:46.748
the group and I always keep my-

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:52.253
two of those. As I know we can

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:52.854
reach a lot of this bill that

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.424
are never going to. Virtually

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.024
no matter if someone were for

01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:57.558
me tenure ago I probably

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:00.895
wouldnt of. Left either- but we

01:30:00.962 --> 01:30:04.632
have to understand that be

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:08.269
compassion and understanding.

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:08.836
Does that make not everybody

01:30:08.903 --> 01:30:09.403
can but I know I know that

01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:10.004
that's not even possible for a

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.540
lot of people. But you have to

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:14.675
understand and this is this is

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:16.377
why I'm here today to explain

01:30:16.444 --> 01:30:18.279
how this works and how they

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:18.813
think and how they feel.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.450
Extremists feel isolated. There

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:24.519
increased isolation will only

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.554
further radicalized them. As I

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:28.422
mentioned about simply holding

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:29.023
a door for somebody of another

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.827
race. The movement there's

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:35.563
people won't even go to ethnic

01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:38.199
restaurant they won't go in see

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:42.670
certain movies they won't- they

01:30:42.737 --> 01:30:43.237
won't even talk to somebody

01:30:43.304 --> 01:30:46.374
about the race or or- after.

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:46.941
You know so these people are

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:50.211
ready self. Self isolated so

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.613
it's very hard to reach people

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:56.450
like that so a lot of times

01:30:56.517 --> 01:30:57.051
simply breaking through that

01:30:57.118 --> 01:31:00.955
polarization and getting them

01:31:01.022 --> 01:31:02.156
to understand- that what that

01:31:02.223 --> 01:31:04.559
your human being too I mean

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:07.061
this is a lot of. A lot of the

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.930
ways it broke it down for me it

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.431
was originally I'm from

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:13.467
Minnesota and I moved to

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.369
Detroit in Detroit the whites

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:18.940
are a minority I had I was

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:19.540
forced basically to deal with.

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:22.343
People of all. On a daily basis

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:26.047
for many many so many wonderful

01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:28.482
people from all different

01:31:28.549 --> 01:31:30.751
racial backgrounds and started

01:31:30.818 --> 01:31:31.319
during their store wow this

01:31:31.385 --> 01:31:33.354
person's family is no different

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.724
than mine this person had the

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.693
same struggles but I do and-

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.862
listing is that sound when

01:31:40.928 --> 01:31:44.198
you're in this. Cult like

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:44.799
environment or in this bubble

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:48.469
Utah. Beyond that you don't see

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.304
that Solana times simply

01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:52.673
humanizing the person sitting

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.775
across from you and getting

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:55.343
them out of that isolation

01:31:55.409 --> 01:31:56.477
treating them with compassion

01:31:56.544 --> 01:32:00.748
and kindness- really works a

01:32:00.815 --> 01:32:01.382
friend of mine. Of Daryl Davis

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:03.851
is a black guy that goes in its

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:06.354
hands clamped meetings and

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:09.991
befriends Klansman and a lot of

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:10.458
people think general's

01:32:10.524 --> 01:32:11.659
absolutely crazy I told when I

01:32:11.726 --> 01:32:13.561
first minimized you are crazy.

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:17.899
But what he does works because

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:22.270
he'll sit back home. All those

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.906
stereo types. And fire coming

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:25.573
out bodies. Because we all have

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.240
commonalities with differences.

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.475
Frances are so much less. Than

01:32:27.541 --> 01:32:28.042
the common at these in the

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:32.113
similarity between all the

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:34.515
people of different races. But

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:40.454
it was harder before you see so

01:32:40.521 --> 01:32:43.291
we can do that as a as a come.

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:43.858
People as human beings we're

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:47.028
gonna get somewhat. He you know.

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:48.996
Thinking in this this movie

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:51.899
disengage. Medicalization if

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.702
you come up to these people and

01:32:54.769 --> 01:32:56.871
you you in their face and this

01:32:56.938 --> 01:33:00.107
is what I know thanks to the

01:33:00.174 --> 01:33:00.641
anti for because anti. Six

01:33:00.708 --> 01:33:07.014
seven. Ever. Balloons attacking

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:08.816
people cannot see face all

01:33:08.883 --> 01:33:10.017
these kind of things they don't

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.719
work I've been through that and

01:33:11.786 --> 01:33:15.823
I you. Every once tactics work

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:20.194
if you. Hey how's. In the face

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.063
really hard for you to get

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.697
punched in the face gonna fight

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:26.267
back in you can get the

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:29.971
radicalized usually those kind

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:32.139
of tactics further radicalized

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:34.342
individual drive into that

01:33:34.408 --> 01:33:34.976
space that you're trying to get

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:39.347
them out of. And an attack it

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:40.214
that way that in my mind in

01:33:40.281 --> 01:33:43.217
from my experience as the best

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:46.020
way attacking violence with

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:48.422
violence. Not a word. Meeting

01:33:48.489 --> 01:33:53.194
hate with hate it's not work.

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.464
Ms and solutions and now this

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:58.099
is said to talk about today.

01:33:58.165 --> 01:34:06.841
Thanks also. Working together.

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.175
That all of us together

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:10.578
aberration act I make on this

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:14.148
for. But former ext as well as

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:17.218
from far right for. The move

01:34:17.284 --> 01:34:17.752
and that thing because I

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:20.054
understand how they think what

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.623
bottom their college prep call

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:26.560
it whatever you want but we do

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.462
understand caller but we don't

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:33.300
have a chance. Some of the

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:35.169
academics of. All together we

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:37.905
can provide the kind of support.

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:38.472
It takes to get these people

01:34:38.539 --> 01:34:42.109
out of. And I want to say like.

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:42.743
Similar one email that left him

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.645
after. You know what we need to

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:48.549
have a program. And I said what

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:49.150
do you say your alcohol like

01:34:49.216 --> 01:34:50.251
and- you know what I mean we

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:50.818
need to have a support group

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.620
because they're saying like she

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.388
was saying in this is true for

01:34:54.455 --> 01:34:54.955
just about everybody you've

01:34:55.022 --> 01:34:56.323
lost all your friends you've

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:58.292
lost your support network.

01:34:58.359 --> 01:35:00.161
You've lost most of the people

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:00.795
you know some of these people

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.430
don't have strong family

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:04.231
support networks so everyone

01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:06.500
they knew everyone around them.

01:35:06.567 --> 01:35:08.135
What's in that bubble. And now

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:12.306
that they're out of it. They

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.241
don't have anybody so. It's

01:35:14.308 --> 01:35:18.179
very important. That there's

01:35:18.245 --> 01:35:20.448
programs in place to try to

01:35:20.514 --> 01:35:26.487
help these people. So for some

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.823
it might be further any patient

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:30.624
AB placement. Meaning programs

01:35:30.691 --> 01:35:34.562
get a model. The St immersion

01:35:34.628 --> 01:35:40.134
pro. This a little bit like I

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:40.701
was talking about immersion

01:35:40.768 --> 01:35:43.471
programs would be something

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.071
that works hand in hand with

01:35:44.138 --> 01:35:45.406
community and I'll reach

01:35:45.473 --> 01:35:47.074
leaders whether its mosques

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:49.410
synagogues community centers

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:52.546
churches things like that all

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:53.147
in tears and people from all

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:56.584
different aspects walks a life.

01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:57.184
You take somebody from the men

01:35:57.251 --> 01:36:00.855
and- in person. I'm or one

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:01.455
experience I can draw upon was

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:02.990
I was in a movie called- white

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:07.061
right the filmmakers DHEA con.

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:07.628
Con is an activist from the

01:36:07.695 --> 01:36:11.932
left. From these most long from

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:16.871
them. The end. People in an SL

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.607
and other organise and this

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:21.442
woman's hi in compassion

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:25.379
reached. And ting them touch

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:29.316
them in a lot of different ways

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:30.284
she spent to them like so you

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:33.220
want to throw me out of this

01:36:33.287 --> 01:36:34.388
country would you which throw

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:38.192
me up again and- one of the-

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:38.759
unanswered Adderley couldn't

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:43.764
answer. It in. Them to the car

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:48.903
because the night. Is asking

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:49.370
the question that was

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:52.439
unsettling. Broke down the bear

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:53.007
and some of the people that

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:54.241
were in that fit là. People

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.577
have persevered and done that

01:36:56.644 --> 01:37:00.114
sort of thing and for her she

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:00.748
was a victim she was a victim

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:04.351
of white supremacy- I won't get

01:37:04.418 --> 01:37:06.120
into her story of because

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:06.720
that's not for me to tell but

01:37:06.787 --> 01:37:08.255
she was a victim so it takes.

01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:12.259
His own president at amount of

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:14.228
compassion to be able to do

01:37:14.295 --> 01:37:14.895
things like that it reminds me

01:37:14.962 --> 01:37:18.132
of another woman not hope

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:18.732
Haidar that works with us that

01:37:18.799 --> 01:37:20.401
parallel networks. Hope's

01:37:20.467 --> 01:37:22.503
father was and- and hope is a

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:24.605
black woman her father was

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:26.140
murdered by a white supremacist.

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:26.774
And hope is probably one of the

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:32.146
most forgiving people. She is

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:32.780
the kind of forgiveness that I

01:37:32.846 --> 01:37:34.215
don't think I could ever have

01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:34.882
or that most people could ever

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:36.483
have she attends the parole

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:38.185
hearings for the guy that

01:37:38.252 --> 01:37:40.421
killed our father. She's been

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:42.256
able to forgive and try to

01:37:42.323 --> 01:37:44.325
understand that that sort of

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.560
thing so I think forgiveness is

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:48.195
a powerful powerful tool- and

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:50.364
I'm not suggesting we go to the

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:52.233
level that hope was able to go

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:54.335
to but that's one of the things

01:37:54.401 --> 01:37:54.969
we do with parallel networks as

01:37:55.035 --> 01:37:58.172
we work with. Former jihadis

01:37:58.239 --> 01:38:00.007
former white nationalists

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:00.641
victims of hate that sort of

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:04.078
thing along with academics. And

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:04.712
get everybody to work together

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.614
and build this not community

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.217
because we need to replace wife

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:10.784
parallel networks is because

01:38:10.851 --> 01:38:14.154
we're trying to replace. What

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:14.688
they have lost you know

01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:16.357
building new network for the

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:20.461
people to have something. Up

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:21.028
positive in their life. And

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:24.431
actually today. Our control alt

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:28.235
delete hate magazine this is

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:30.504
something we're gonna be in Sir

01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:34.041
tell them print issue. I had

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:36.243
hoped brings with but it low.

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.245
The press today the map in that

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:38.812
we've produced to break down

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:40.381
these sort of things and to get

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.182
it into the people's hands so

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.251
we can break down hate it's

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:46.353
written completely by farmers-

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.889
victims of hate and academics

01:38:48.956 --> 01:38:52.259
in in these roles. Fifty

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:52.893
extremist let's help from these

01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:54.528
programs. I'm to come in this

01:38:54.595 --> 01:38:58.465
in the future. I would suggest

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:04.805
make. Ms mandates. Sure.

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:05.372
Because that will break down

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:10.177
the state's type old birds so

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:19.320
we going to do it someone has a

01:39:19.386 --> 01:39:22.189
crack addiction problem. And

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:22.823
you go okay well you way for I

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:25.225
think there's a handful of

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:33.100
money in a new part. In the old.

01:39:33.167 --> 01:39:33.734
Is in place you can't just say

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.035
what this and get this person

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:38.005
I've got out so. Problem solved

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:41.008
is done no a lot need long term

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.343
counseling they need at new

01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:44.545
network the need a port group

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:49.650
or they could go back. And

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:50.217
that's what we're trying to

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:50.884
avoid. Having someone say on.

01:39:50.951 --> 01:39:51.485
And then going right back into

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:55.956
the previous. Is something

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:56.557
that's healthy or or if and

01:39:56.623 --> 01:39:58.192
when you do that is well making

01:39:58.258 --> 01:40:02.229
the immersion program.

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:02.796
Mandatory I think would be a

01:40:02.863 --> 01:40:07.000
pop. Does it will show them at

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.869
these other human. And they may

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:11.305
have I stated themselves when

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:11.905
they were in the nationalist

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:12.873
movement- but meet with these

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:16.944
volunteers. That help in this

01:40:17.010 --> 01:40:17.511
type of thing I would make a

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:20.414
difference I really do. When

01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:22.716
the former's have a critical

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.485
role in this because of our

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:27.154
under ending on reach these

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:27.688
people are law you know my

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:31.325
number down form. I somewhat

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:34.862
lot of people don't realize.

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:37.064
There's one guy said to me says.

01:40:37.131 --> 01:40:38.399
Good thing the move brought.

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:41.268
All the in all the years you

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:41.835
were in it has brought blood

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:44.338
sweat and tears. It's not a

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.673
good thing is law negativity

01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:47.274
it's a lot of it it's a rough

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:53.013
life it's not a good if. And.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:53.580
They don't they don't even

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:54.748
realize it's like being lost

01:40:54.815 --> 01:40:56.283
tunnel and not understanding

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:58.652
what you've really lost and

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:01.355
then come out and you see like.

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:01.955
It is like the kid they can't

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:05.592
see any gets new glasses or

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:06.160
contacts I was a kid by the

01:41:06.226 --> 01:41:13.500
way. Dot. You know that's like

01:41:13.567 --> 01:41:14.101
when you finally see like what

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:16.303
you've been missing. Change is

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:24.111
possible. This today. To be

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:24.711
able to do something like this

01:41:24.778 --> 01:41:26.947
check pots. Real change. Born

01:41:27.014 --> 01:41:32.886
this learn the can on learned.

01:41:32.953 --> 01:41:37.024
Jamie. I mean these people

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.725
Tackett people not gonna help

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:42.930
when it is there causation.

01:41:42.996 --> 01:41:52.406
This past the wait. I believe

01:41:52.473 --> 01:41:56.310
that most. Less perfect we all

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:58.912
think we're ashamed of. A bad

01:41:58.979 --> 01:42:05.052
thing. Yeah and I think for

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:10.858
everybody the dad Todd

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:11.425
redemption as well typically

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:15.929
yes. That's all today my

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:16.530
presentation I'd like to thank

01:42:16.597 --> 01:42:28.175
everybody. Getting us in in

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:30.611
some de L. information about

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:34.348
background to and- what you've

01:42:34.414 --> 01:42:37.251
experienced in your and in your

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:40.354
life- we're going to move out

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.756
to- quick comments and I'd like

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.124
to give my colleagues an

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:46.360
opportunity if they have any

01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:47.027
questions but if you don't mind

01:42:47.094 --> 01:42:48.328
I'd like to kick that off

01:42:48.395 --> 01:42:52.199
asked- ask you- two questions

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:54.334
one is- was there was there-

01:42:54.401 --> 01:42:56.837
you have to name names but was

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:58.505
there an individual or an

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:00.374
organization. That approached

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:02.509
you that- and did you suddenly

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:08.048
clock- or did it take some time

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:12.419
and then- you mention peril.

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:12.986
Networks and I don't imagine

01:43:13.053 --> 01:43:16.123
that the only group out there.

01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:18.759
Do you know how organizations

01:43:18.825 --> 01:43:20.394
that are funded- and who who

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.829
sponsors them. Let me do one

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:26.533
question the time yeah the

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.335
first the first part was.

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:32.372
What's your sub was there a an

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:32.973
individual or an organization

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.443
that- reached out to you and-

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:38.845
it clicked suddenly or to take

01:43:38.912 --> 01:43:40.647
some time this was something

01:43:40.714 --> 01:43:42.549
that took me about three years

01:43:42.616 --> 01:43:44.384
about three years and was

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.653
meeting a number of individuals

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:48.288
over that period of years- and

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:50.624
sort of breaking it down so for

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:53.093
me I wasn't really approached

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.597
until I was. Starting to get

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.398
out- in the past year that I

01:43:58.465 --> 01:44:00.901
was in. I approach parallel

01:44:00.968 --> 01:44:04.204
networks I had some contact

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.807
with some other people and-

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:07.341
they started talking to me

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:12.279
about getting out. So yes there

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:12.879
is other far as how the group

01:44:12.946 --> 01:44:14.815
performed that works as a non

01:44:14.881 --> 01:44:18.986
profit so we depend on. I don't

01:44:19.052 --> 01:44:20.921
really know how it all works

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:24.091
yet because new inner. Soul I

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:24.691
think you probably know more

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.126
about it than I do as far as

01:44:26.193 --> 01:44:28.428
how aye aye what you told me

01:44:28.495 --> 01:44:28.996
tonight. And I want to thank

01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:32.299
you. But I do know that- these

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.534
are things that. Seriously need

01:44:34.601 --> 01:44:36.303
funding I don't know how how

01:44:36.370 --> 01:44:38.805
the funding exactly works I'm

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:40.273
sure some of Michael- coworkers

01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.209
and peril on that works

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:44.378
understand. That there's other

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:44.945
organizations such as life

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:47.414
after hate is another one-

01:44:47.481 --> 01:44:50.183
there's a few debt. Is a few

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:50.784
different groups that do this

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:54.388
work but it's. How they get the

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.323
full thing and all but I'm too

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.957
new to it to really be able to

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.558
tell you how they how they get

01:44:58.625 --> 01:44:59.192
some of it does come from the

01:44:59.259 --> 01:45:00.827
private sector- I know there

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:02.429
was some grants that were

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:06.667
supposed to be going to life

01:45:06.733 --> 01:45:09.169
after hate at some point. But.

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:10.671
I don't think that happened. So

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:14.508
yeah thank you questions. All

01:45:14.574 --> 01:45:16.943

people reporting. In his crimes

01:49:14.714 --> 01:49:15.282
against them what you want to

01:49:15.348 --> 01:49:17.384

your comment thank you for your

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:32.365
question. I would say this if

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:32.933
you feel that there when it

01:49:32.999 --> 01:49:33.566
comes so I hate speech. I fight

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:34.768
hate with hate. In a negative

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:40.240
way is the answer. Point.

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:43.443
Responding is isn't he said you

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:45.679
have to love. Try to befriend

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:46.179
try to understand intro

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:50.016
compassion. I would say for the

01:49:50.083 --> 01:49:52.385
individuals who are victims of

01:49:52.452 --> 01:49:56.056
hate crimes you have to port

01:49:56.122 --> 01:50:00.827
crimes there's way that we can

01:50:00.894 --> 01:50:02.996
even combat those. In our we

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:04.631
need we are Daly facing and

01:50:04.698 --> 01:50:07.167
pulls are really the voiceless

01:50:07.233 --> 01:50:08.969
because there are. Sir

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:13.707
political. In the in the

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:14.274
Hispanic or Latino community

01:50:14.341 --> 01:50:14.874
were find are afraid to come

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:15.976
forward because the rate of the

01:50:16.042 --> 01:50:16.543
repercussions of. Partition

01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:21.114
were being again. Freight the

01:50:21.181 --> 01:50:23.950
middle to end this is goes the

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:28.655
most to me also- individuals

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:29.255
are afraid because it will be

01:50:29.322 --> 01:50:32.158
targeted. Hello this man is

01:50:32.225 --> 01:50:33.960
that Mr. Everyone in the

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:37.897
voiceless. It's not our job to

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.265
pick a side of the one side I

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:40.367
Republican press our job right.

01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:43.403
That we live. Hey in courage

01:50:43.470 --> 01:50:48.441
that report the crime. At the

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.042
ranch read in a place. And we

01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:55.482
can figure. Let me add another

01:50:55.548 --> 01:50:57.150
suggestion because in some

01:50:57.217 --> 01:51:02.655
thing is to as prevalent. I

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:03.256
have no doubt that it that it

01:51:03.323 --> 01:51:08.528
it. A you know a survey is a

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:12.365
good way of trying to- assessed

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:14.267
and then show the- extent to

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:18.638
which an issue a exists in a

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:21.741
community whether it's a

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:22.308
college community or city or

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:23.977
neighborhood. And so you may

01:51:24.044 --> 01:51:26.713
want to look at developing a

01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:30.350
way to. Seve that kind of

01:51:30.417 --> 01:51:32.986
information and categorizing it

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:35.055
in a way that is separate and

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:35.688
apart from the criminal justice

01:51:35.755 --> 01:51:40.794
system. Just some good news

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.363
real quick our our leave our

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:46.299
lead story showed thank god

01:51:46.366 --> 01:51:51.738
last year anti Muslim cry

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:56.009
finally went down found that to.

01:51:56.076 --> 01:52:01.281
Twenty seven even. Anti assault

01:52:01.347 --> 01:52:02.949
Muslim still was higher than

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:06.386
that hello anti Arab crimes

01:52:06.453 --> 01:52:08.788
unfortunately with seen

01:52:08.855 --> 01:52:09.422
something he's twenty seventeen

01:52:09.489 --> 01:52:12.992
to. But hope god was on their

01:52:13.059 --> 01:52:14.627
figure it will come Kerr's data

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:16.029
and our data showing a decline

01:52:16.096 --> 01:52:18.231
at the mother I'm twenty

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:18.765
eighteen I of course it's

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:19.399
always to scan number come down

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:19.999
but what we're looking for our

01:52:20.066 --> 01:52:21.201
long term trend lines were

01:52:21.267 --> 01:52:22.702
continuously goes down and

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:24.871
doesn't bounce around a high

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:28.374
number. Our next to a comment

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:44.624
from a night out Lawrence. I

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:47.227
I'm in Iran and first of our

01:52:47.293 --> 01:52:50.897
most I enjoy this. And I Philip

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:51.498
this conversation kids in to

01:52:51.564 --> 01:52:57.036
continue on like. Hopefully we

01:52:57.103 --> 01:52:57.637
can have some more change in

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:00.640
the future so. Although we went

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:01.207
through the hate crimes and

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:03.309
everything like that. Did not

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:04.878
go over was white privilege

01:53:04.944 --> 01:53:06.312
that I went gov. So I exam what

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:10.750
I put. Many people though it

01:53:10.817 --> 01:53:12.652
exist and so one example of my

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:13.253
privileges the fact that we

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:16.356
have. Former White soliciting

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:20.693
here that is for you to be. The

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.262
all around too pretty much.

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:26.166
Take to in a way cool and so.

01:53:26.232 --> 01:53:26.733
Sample of our crews with use

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:28.468
with how. Anybody know to mayor

01:53:28.535 --> 01:53:34.407
rice. So even more examples I

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:37.076
keep is of an armed boys and on

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:37.710
our black men who were killed

01:53:37.777 --> 01:53:40.280
by police I want used to be a

01:53:40.346 --> 01:53:40.847
rice. Temple and so the fact

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:46.519
that. By the bees. Again and we

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:49.155
had a nineteen year old white

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:49.756
by the name of Nicholas crews

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:52.559
who went into a squirrel and

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:55.461
murdered seventeen people and

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:58.198
so nineteen year old boy walked

01:53:58.264 --> 01:53:58.698
out alive breeding and

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:02.101
everything apps for a twelve

01:54:02.168 --> 01:54:02.669
year old black boy who had a

01:54:02.735 --> 01:54:06.573
toy gun was gunned down so that

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:07.207
their- love why approved. And I

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:10.076
want. Rainy days and that's

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:10.643
something that we on is talk

01:54:10.710 --> 01:54:12.412
about more thank you. Thank you

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:18.885
very much. One of the reasons.

01:54:18.952 --> 01:54:21.221
That there's more than the

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:24.824
average security areas that

01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:28.661
were I'm concerned. Outside

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:30.063
folks might want to take

01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:30.630
advantage of the fact that

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:32.365
we're talking about this very

01:54:32.432 --> 01:54:34.667
sensitive topic Bob says more

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:36.636
than the usual more than the

01:54:36.703 --> 01:54:39.272
common amount of security for a

01:54:39.339 --> 01:54:41.608
select committee or for. Any

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:42.242
committee even in that in the

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:45.445
in the capital but that's large

01:54:45.511 --> 01:54:47.380
they're here- but thank you

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:51.050
for. In that up. Next we have

01:54:51.117 --> 01:55:06.399
just in case. Close short good

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:10.103

this event that you guys put

01:55:12.739 --> 01:55:14.507
together for like it's very

01:55:14.574 --> 01:55:15.141
necessary for us to talk about

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:16.976
this all want to thank all you

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.878
guys on the panel. First and

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:22.815
foremost- but I sat there long

01:55:22.882 --> 01:55:23.349
and hard thinking about a

01:55:23.416 --> 01:55:23.950
question a housing company and

01:55:24.017 --> 01:55:29.222
ask. En I mean although I can

01:55:29.289 --> 01:55:30.790
come down here and- of the

01:55:30.857 --> 01:55:33.192
things that. I wanted to touch

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:34.127
on is one of things that. Even

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:34.694
to is. You can't fight hate

01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:36.429
with hate you guys. Touched on

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:40.500
that. Earlier but to me. Of

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:43.403
what do you suppose that.

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:43.970
People of non color when you

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:46.372
have these. All right movements

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:47.940
these national groups and

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:49.175
they're coming down in your

01:55:49.242 --> 01:55:51.244
cities and their come down here

01:55:51.311 --> 01:55:53.813
and what do you. Are you not

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.447
supposed. Not supposed to fix

01:55:54.514 --> 01:55:57.583
anything or to do anything and

01:55:57.650 --> 01:56:00.353
then finally start to speak up

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:00.953
in a- manner you get shut down

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.924
and send away. IT so how do you

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:06.826
expect. Us as a people of color

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:08.361
to dance progress in America.

01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:10.830
We quite frankly were allowed

01:56:10.897 --> 01:56:11.364
to a lot of us come from

01:56:11.431 --> 01:56:13.199
brown's were were already

01:56:13.266 --> 01:56:15.802
fighting a system that isn't

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.870
built for us in America the

01:56:17.937 --> 01:56:22.375
first place. So we do have

01:56:22.442 --> 01:56:23.009
these. Groups come that you say

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:25.111
and you tell us. It's not gets

01:56:25.178 --> 01:56:27.647
a fight hate with hate but what

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:28.247
if but what what has sitting

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:30.383
around goddess all these years.

01:56:30.450 --> 01:56:30.950
Where where has that got us

01:56:31.017 --> 01:56:35.421
look look up. One you guys as a

01:56:35.488 --> 01:56:40.493
pan. The answer that what. As a

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.127
people can we do to combat this

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:52.605
that. You run for office you

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:56.809
get college degree vote. The

01:56:56.876 --> 01:57:00.546
court ruled time to time. I

01:57:00.613 --> 01:57:01.147
know that there is a movement

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:05.385
of people. Stand with. It's

01:57:05.451 --> 01:57:07.720
bigger than you think the

01:57:07.787 --> 01:57:10.156
loudest most of voices of hate.

01:57:10.223 --> 01:57:12.792
I'm sure have one and I can

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:16.629
tell you that the person who

01:57:16.696 --> 01:57:19.699
made me going to do. Bottom. He

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:23.569
was a segregated school and

01:57:23.636 --> 01:57:28.107
living in an attic and he went

01:57:28.174 --> 01:57:28.708
to the dean and the dean said

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:29.342
would separate putting. You in

01:57:29.409 --> 01:57:35.281
will record. He read. You do.

01:57:35.348 --> 01:57:38.451
Assemblymember midday. I can

01:57:38.518 --> 01:57:42.054
add something to that. First

01:57:42.121 --> 01:57:46.359
when it comes to fighting hate

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:47.994
sound are pro testing thing. In

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:50.630
itself is something that I'm

01:57:50.696 --> 01:57:53.733
sure Jeff will attempt to they

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.702
they knew that they expected

01:57:56.769 --> 01:57:59.772
that they would up would not.

01:57:59.839 --> 01:58:00.406
Hundred counter protesters show

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:00.907
up who do you think got

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:02.442
arrested. Testers because

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:08.948
usually anger lead to violence

01:58:09.015 --> 01:58:12.018
which to the rest that do

01:58:12.084 --> 01:58:14.487
anybody any good all it does is

01:58:14.554 --> 01:58:15.321
get the **** in the class white

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:19.158
I'm assist. So that's terminate

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:21.327
those rallies. I and knowing

01:58:21.394 --> 01:58:23.429
what and so there are there are

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:24.330
other ways to pressure concerns

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:26.699
now we have so to media where

01:58:26.766 --> 01:58:27.300
you can go online and calmly

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:30.903
discuss this is Jeff said maybe

01:58:30.970 --> 01:58:31.504
you try to make friends with

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:36.409
somebody maybe not one of those

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.009
right. Please or or something

01:58:37.076 --> 01:58:40.513
else. The negativity that comes.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.549
Of some of those same does not

01:58:43.616 --> 01:58:45.284
do any of any it only benefits

01:58:45.351 --> 01:58:51.023
the extra. To respond to a

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:59.031
young people thank you. I marks

01:58:59.098 --> 01:58:59.665
Ted then I am happy to be here

01:58:59.732 --> 01:59:04.904
and encourage. All folks to

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:10.142
stand. But it needs and I agree

01:59:10.209 --> 01:59:14.313
the young people us. To it hi

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.716
it happens because we do live.

01:59:16.782 --> 01:59:21.087
Lee in a races IT this is Susan

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:24.724
permeates of our ours we see it

01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:25.358
everywhere see it everywhere we

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:31.397
see it. We see an institution.

01:59:31.464 --> 01:59:31.964
Unfortunately we continue to

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:39.338
see it. There is spectrum.

01:59:39.405 --> 01:59:43.609
Eight and we are looking at

01:59:43.676 --> 01:59:44.243
right now you know the most a

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:48.214
strong arm of hate. You can go.

01:59:48.281 --> 01:59:50.182
When I read today you know

01:59:50.249 --> 01:59:53.219
someone CA are. Of color in

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:53.853
line perhaps in the first class

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:59.191
and asking. The right. Where we

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:01.093
see in rivers. Next may by the

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:08.167
conduct. Of the metro train

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:09.769
another pop school. Going do

02:00:09.835 --> 02:00:14.674
you wanna. In the group it up

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:15.741
the girl stood up. Tape those

02:00:15.808 --> 02:00:19.078
remarks. She then came to my

02:00:19.145 --> 02:00:22.915
office I. At the metrolink

02:00:22.982 --> 02:00:23.549
resident a to come to. We had a

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:27.520
meet. You know by videotaping

02:00:27.587 --> 02:00:30.356
and she got it on the news so I

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:32.191
think it's incumbent upon us to

02:00:32.258 --> 02:00:36.295
every single time we see some

02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:39.065
infringe upon. Question whether

02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:42.268
we belong on or not. Certain

02:00:42.335 --> 02:00:48.574
places stand. Do it fully. But

02:00:48.641 --> 02:00:55.948
is but we need to stand up.

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:58.484
Know what to say to you when-

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:01.087
we have these rallies and there

02:01:01.153 --> 02:01:03.723
were fighting and things like

02:01:03.789 --> 02:01:06.692
that the people in the movement

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:07.226
based on that absolutely

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:09.195
thrives on it so when there was

02:01:09.261 --> 02:01:10.396
violence they could get a

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:13.666
chance to fight. Remember rally

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:19.472
was in. And the police. Kiley

02:01:19.538 --> 02:01:22.174
for nothing. The. Out there to

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:22.775
hear it you know like they say

02:01:22.842 --> 02:01:23.376
like el we've got free speech

02:01:23.442 --> 02:01:24.710
in this country but you're

02:01:24.777 --> 02:01:26.979
speaking and nobody hears it

02:01:27.046 --> 02:01:27.546
you know like a tree falling

02:01:27.613 --> 02:01:29.649
press no one hears it I can see

02:01:29.715 --> 02:01:30.316
that on all the route is I ever

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.984
doing past twenty seven years

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:32.618
that route the city where there

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.620
was hardly any be there but-

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:37.857
press it was the most

02:01:37.923 --> 02:01:38.324
demoralizing from the

02:01:38.391 --> 02:01:38.891
standpoint of all. Right now

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:44.930
the list. Ever been at whereas

02:01:44.997 --> 02:01:47.967
store. We have fistfight. And

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:48.601
the battles in like that eyes

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:51.804
let me I need to do that again.

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:52.405
You know we can we have that

02:01:52.471 --> 02:01:53.005
this work. Was boring. So it's

02:01:53.072 --> 02:01:54.640
like we don't feed into that

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:59.011
because I. Think it's- out of

02:01:59.078 --> 02:02:01.080
the movement I think. It keeps

02:02:01.147 --> 02:02:01.614
people there if there's- a

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:06.652
peaceful protest. Since but I

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:12.692
got like to salute. Complete

02:02:12.758 --> 02:02:14.960
warrant for to test. Islands

02:02:15.027 --> 02:02:20.266
then it just blows up the water.

02:02:20.332 --> 02:02:22.902
I want to tell you. So proud of

02:02:22.968 --> 02:02:25.004
having the. I think change

02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:29.842
happen because of you. The way

02:02:29.909 --> 02:02:34.413
use those of us who live in

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:35.047
have expected so many different

02:02:35.114 --> 02:02:38.384
things our reaction was

02:02:38.451 --> 02:02:42.855
different and the dead. About

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:44.890
what would you all do. Excited

02:02:44.957 --> 02:02:50.429
that day. You you hold us to

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:52.031
tell you talk about privilege

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:54.333
we have to talk about that

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:54.867
because that is important.

02:02:54.934 --> 02:02:59.171
Don't in in the room. No pun

02:02:59.238 --> 02:03:02.742
intended. Those are the sorts

02:03:02.808 --> 02:03:04.610
of things we have to talk about

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:08.247
and knowing young. Is that are

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:08.814
that are getting grease to

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.583
becoming the judges that are

02:03:10.649 --> 02:03:12.485
becoming the elected officials

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:13.018
things are going to change

02:03:13.085 --> 02:03:16.322
because of you. They're going

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:16.989
to change because of you not in

02:03:17.056 --> 02:03:18.457
spite of you but because of

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:22.895
you. I thank you for being here.

02:03:22.962 --> 02:03:27.299
The each of these questions

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:30.336
and- general topics are that

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:34.507
taught the subject of a course.

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:40.212
They are they are exercise does.

02:03:40.279 --> 02:03:40.846
But I think. If you don't mind

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:48.888
my. Calling you by first name.

02:03:48.954 --> 02:03:53.826
Bob on compassion of so you can

02:03:53.893 --> 02:03:59.765
confront and be compassionate.

02:03:59.832 --> 02:04:00.366
And I do think that we have to

02:04:00.432 --> 02:04:03.736
confront. Race I'm sorry some

02:04:03.803 --> 02:04:05.237
anti some Islamophobia Walker

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:09.208
said. But then what fall. What

02:04:09.275 --> 02:04:12.478
fall those are saying that's

02:04:12.545 --> 02:04:17.349
not acceptable. That's were I'm

02:04:17.416 --> 02:04:20.519
where what we heard from if-

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:21.120
gives me some hope and some

02:04:21.187 --> 02:04:25.357
ideas since fought about where

02:04:25.424 --> 02:04:26.025
you might go from here which to

02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:30.062
me for this fall. A series of

02:04:30.129 --> 02:04:32.164
select. Committee hearings this

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:36.502
kind of struggle it's- takes a

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:37.069
lot work to put together an

02:04:37.136 --> 02:04:39.238
event like this but we're- with

02:04:39.305 --> 02:04:40.506

here information but what we do

02:04:44.276 --> 02:04:46.545
and information how do we move

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.213
forward and way that's positive

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:50.115
and helps change the world-

02:04:50.182 --> 02:04:52.585

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.320
we've cut- still have a few of

02:04:54.386 --> 02:04:56.989
these will try to move this

02:04:57.056 --> 02:05:00.059
along we've got- because- it's

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:00.593

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:07.032

02:05:07.099 --> 02:05:08.200
keep this going Sherri Gilliam.

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:18.711
Followed by Nicholas first.

02:05:18.777 --> 02:05:20.646
Your call two names the time if

I have two older than most

02:05:25.451 --> 02:05:27.553
people here I combined what

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:28.954
what I don't want to. Be on

02:05:29.021 --> 02:05:31.023
that- there's a twenty five

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:34.760
million. The state okay three

02:05:34.827 --> 02:05:36.228
hundred twenty million when I

02:05:36.295 --> 02:05:38.898
see the white supremacists-

02:05:38.964 --> 02:05:40.900
rally have hand four hundred

02:05:40.966 --> 02:05:41.500
when I have staff people give

02:05:41.567 --> 02:05:47.239

02:05:47.306 --> 02:05:49.575
twenty two yeah thirty seven

02:05:49.642 --> 02:05:53.012
fifty. When I look the police

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:53.646
shooting the mails black people

02:05:53.712 --> 02:05:54.780

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:57.149
night. But the same time look

02:05:57.216 --> 02:05:59.218
this room seven hundred people

02:05:59.285 --> 02:06:00.252
living here. Time six that's

02:06:00.319 --> 02:06:02.655
how many people get killed the

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:05.024
Chicago Bulls. Eight thousand

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.492
in here black kids are killing

02:06:06.558 --> 02:06:08.761
each other the inner cities. We

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:10.496
do not have a white problem

02:06:10.562 --> 02:06:11.063
what we have is a violence

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:14.667
problem. And it's fine for you

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:15.267
guys. I sit here I do except

give your percentage. Don't

02:06:26.645 --> 02:06:28.547
percentage look number. It is

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:30.549
unacceptable what's on our

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:32.785
communities and trying to blame

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:38.824
it on whites. A prince or hate

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:39.391
I grew up in the fifties and

02:06:39.458 --> 02:06:40.392
sixties and the fact. Had real

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:44.096
hatred and real racism.

02:06:44.163 --> 02:06:46.298
Lynchings shootings you can go

02:06:46.365 --> 02:06:46.932
to school with certain people I

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:47.466
was blessed you can go to

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:48.767
certain bathrooms my dad mom in

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.569
up in Florida the legion

02:06:50.636 --> 02:06:52.638
capital of the world they have

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:54.707
some Hollister second change.

02:06:54.773 --> 02:06:56.675
Would really change your mind

02:06:56.742 --> 02:06:57.276
and with that being said at

02:06:57.343 --> 02:07:00.412
that point there was thousand

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:02.648
people that were steps whatever

02:07:02.715 --> 02:07:03.182
you can barely community

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:06.151
without fear of some

02:07:06.218 --> 02:07:06.785
Appalachian are killing you and

02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:08.554
there was no loss protect them.

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:11.190
We have grown pass at one I

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:11.757
wonder when they come a day

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:14.226
when I look the kids hear what

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:18.464
they're saying. And my main. I

02:07:18.530 --> 02:07:22.201
have to assn who's bothered you.

02:07:22.267 --> 02:07:22.768
Most you gotta be good luck

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.470
unless you live in inner

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:25.037
cities. You can one go to

02:07:25.104 --> 02:07:26.905
school when you want. It

02:07:26.972 --> 02:07:27.539
restaurants where you want you

02:07:27.606 --> 02:07:29.074
know use a bathroom where you

02:07:29.141 --> 02:07:30.242
want. Who these people that our

02:07:30.309 --> 02:07:32.378
body is so bad on you we don't

02:07:32.444 --> 02:07:34.513
have a the space. This can

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:35.147
happen allow that in a certain

02:07:35.214 --> 02:07:36.648
way you acted when you get out

02:07:36.715 --> 02:07:40.552
of anything at any point could

02:07:40.619 --> 02:07:41.153
cost you your life if stepped

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.256
on a line. Okay my dad and his

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:44.857
friends now and then eighties

02:07:44.923 --> 02:07:46.992
and nineties. If you ever watch

02:07:47.059 --> 02:07:49.028
barbershop. Them near the

02:07:49.094 --> 02:07:51.096
happiest in a women I've ever

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:52.631
seen let me talk I said how do

02:07:52.698 --> 02:07:54.767
they have that. In their heart

02:07:54.833 --> 02:07:56.368
much hatred. Racism what

02:07:56.435 --> 02:07:58.604
directed toward them what they

02:07:58.670 --> 02:08:00.873
had morning thing they have

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:01.306
strong families and

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.441
relationships what we don't

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:04.977
have anymore. I want you to

02:08:05.044 --> 02:08:06.578
challenge your professors what

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.414
they say Ste do you. And they

02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.582
table assists six go the

02:08:10.649 --> 02:08:11.250
library get your group together

02:08:11.316 --> 02:08:12.284
get you some books I feel two

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:14.620
books and go to that social

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:15.254
media Tweedy and Facebook and

02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:16.789
all that kind of. Garbage

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:20.626
values. Get real information at

02:08:20.692 --> 02:08:21.260
ask your professor questions.

02:08:21.326 --> 02:08:31.070
When they pay you fifty set up.

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:31.603
Born you look at that the

02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:34.339
percent maybe two people. That

02:08:34.406 --> 02:08:36.642
is. Not right for them to do

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:39.111
that and give you that false

02:08:39.178 --> 02:08:39.678
answer and what they know is

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:40.312
most. He is not a you know read

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:43.482
study. You have no idea what

02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:44.049
what they're saying with the

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:44.683
top. What information out there

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:47.019
go also to your history you're

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:47.619
not being taught history more.

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:48.320
And how black people really.

02:08:48.387 --> 02:08:50.556
And what how you were treated

02:08:50.622 --> 02:08:53.492
whatever but challenge them. To

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:54.126
do it challenge yourself what

02:08:54.193 --> 02:08:54.760
you're doing education is fine

02:08:54.827 --> 02:08:56.361
keep that. Up is that with an

02:08:56.428 --> 02:08:58.330
argument we're so far removed

02:08:58.397 --> 02:08:58.931
from the slave ship. A lot you

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:00.933
have idea. What they were

02:09:00.999 --> 02:09:01.600
slaves. At one point so I don't

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:03.969
have a problem when you see it

02:09:04.036 --> 02:09:04.536
what's going to rights that

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.805
white supremacy which three of

02:09:06.872 --> 02:09:07.372
four people. Is that how my

02:09:07.439 --> 02:09:10.709
Charlotte. Top of Chicago. This

02:09:10.776 --> 02:09:11.310
room is about a hundred chair

02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:14.847
so in. Time that sticks. That's

02:09:14.913 --> 02:09:15.481
me black kids are killing each

02:09:15.547 --> 02:09:18.684
other in just a cog. Eight

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:19.251
thousand every year. And I'm

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:21.220
sorry about these people. That

02:09:21.286 --> 02:09:21.820
are on this board I see they

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:25.757
these nice look cushy areas

02:09:25.824 --> 02:09:26.325
some you don't whatever but

02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:26.892
they did that the oldest but

02:09:26.959 --> 02:09:28.427
you'll get them. Ladies be and

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:39.037
go home. Lackey is Betty we

02:09:39.104 --> 02:09:42.941
don't yeah. Don't live like

02:09:43.008 --> 02:09:44.076
that. So get your education

02:09:44.143 --> 02:09:44.710
can. Get more in your community

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:46.578
find was going on share your

02:09:46.645 --> 02:09:48.881
professors and they don't want

02:09:48.947 --> 02:09:49.448
to debate me in my little.

02:09:49.515 --> 02:09:50.749
Girls and stuff to get this be

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:51.383
a cold different coverage will

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:52.751
do that all of the caliphs. But

02:09:52.818 --> 02:09:53.318
we need to have some under

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:54.920
discussion and not just people

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:55.521
just you know famous. Things

02:09:55.587 --> 02:09:56.755
whatever have debate between

02:09:56.822 --> 02:09:57.356
two groups. Leaving give you

02:09:57.422 --> 02:09:58.357
real information so you're

02:09:58.423 --> 02:09:59.992
going to be informed but I love

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:00.626
you guys I'm older. I want you

02:10:00.692 --> 02:10:02.461
guys really that flourished

02:10:02.528 --> 02:10:04.429
your education. I want you to.

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:04.997
Make decisions on the form

02:10:05.063 --> 02:10:07.032
information. And continuous

02:10:07.099 --> 02:10:10.502
original question. But I just

02:10:10.569 --> 02:10:11.069
felt. Hard I had to say that

02:10:11.136 --> 02:10:16.475
thank you very much. The

02:10:16.542 --> 02:10:18.544
perspective. The flowers all by

02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:26.785
Randall. Días. Hello hello I'm

02:10:26.852 --> 02:10:28.086
so first say thank you for a

02:10:28.153 --> 02:10:30.422
actually taking I'm just as

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.023
because I'm not be with that

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:33.125
resistance I'll take the time

02:10:33.192 --> 02:10:36.461
to I was the only college. Here

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:36.995
but a big amount of us are

02:10:37.062 --> 02:10:40.465
college students. Take the time

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:42.167
to talk to us our boat I really

02:10:42.234 --> 02:10:42.701
wanted to was for the- to

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:44.670
German at the end- I know you

02:10:44.736 --> 02:10:46.238
said combating hate with hate I

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:46.838
do agree with that that's not

02:10:46.905 --> 02:10:48.674
okay- but- how as group that as

02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.642
me growing up in inner city.

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:52.945
Are identifying as a white male

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.713
and- female- to be hated Bob

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:58.350
why cited from because my

02:10:58.417 --> 02:10:58.917
father's black. How do we go

02:10:58.984 --> 02:11:02.754
against. Will win like for

02:11:02.821 --> 02:11:03.255
instance the black lives

02:11:03.322 --> 02:11:04.656
matter. Is only after that they

02:11:04.723 --> 02:11:07.025
became notices fixing offices

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:07.659
that are wrong. But then came a

02:11:07.726 --> 02:11:08.393
blue lives matter movie and a

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.128
white lies about a movie and a-

02:11:10.195 --> 02:11:12.331
large management. That's

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:12.898
basically the says kind of

02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:14.633
covering up the sins of the-

02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:15.267
shop. If you take it apart like

02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:18.537
people. So the end and I

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.906
respect what you with the lady

02:11:20.973 --> 02:11:21.540
I said I was that bad indeed.

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:24.509
Are we still have like black

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:25.043
males I know from a from

02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:26.445
Bigelow California for me

02:11:26.511 --> 02:11:28.213
California- I've had multiple

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.048
of my friends be gunned down by

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:33.018
police officers. Whether that

02:11:33.085 --> 02:11:33.552
be whether that be for no

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:34.119
apparent reason or for some

02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:36.154
reason at all. It is still

02:11:36.221 --> 02:11:38.457
wrong. The fact that I'm I'm

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.659
dropped in my home city and if

02:11:40.726 --> 02:11:42.427
I get bored over an officer

02:11:42.494 --> 02:11:43.028
tells me. That the reason why

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:50.636
he pulled me over is because I.

02:11:50.702 --> 02:11:51.270
Look like I belong in a certain

02:11:51.336 --> 02:11:56.341
area. Is absolutely wrong. So

02:11:56.408 --> 02:11:57.009
it and I do want to commend you

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:59.044
for Stephanie Stephanie. Into

02:11:59.111 --> 02:11:59.678
the spaces- because it is hard

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:01.747
for somebody who's- who's hated

02:12:01.813 --> 02:12:02.881
black people come here talk. In

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:03.448
a little black people about

02:12:03.515 --> 02:12:05.984
why. Roth so I do commend you

02:12:06.051 --> 02:12:07.252
on that but in a day I don't

02:12:07.319 --> 02:12:07.819
know like what like what it.

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:10.756
Does to do as as you. Are

02:12:10.822 --> 02:12:16.762
always not heard. Of it basis.

02:12:16.828 --> 02:12:17.362
When we got people base. There

02:12:17.429 --> 02:12:24.503
are protests. Okay thank you

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:27.973
for your state your comment. On

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.344
this question I can only answer.

02:12:32.411 --> 02:12:35.747
Number one I am African

02:12:35.814 --> 02:12:37.683
American to almost of what.

02:12:37.749 --> 02:12:40.485
Number three I'm also. So the

02:12:40.552 --> 02:12:44.523
question. The same questions.

02:12:44.589 --> 02:12:49.494
Have an address the officer one

02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:52.230
it is unacceptable for an

02:12:52.297 --> 02:12:52.831
officer approach somebody say

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:53.398
you like you don't. We don't

02:12:53.465 --> 02:12:56.802
teach it. That's an internal.

02:12:56.868 --> 02:13:02.874
Once it's not recommended there

02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:03.475
to know a lot about being out

02:13:03.542 --> 02:13:17.856
of. The result this is. I want.

02:13:17.923 --> 02:13:18.423
No word three does violence

02:13:18.490 --> 02:13:21.693
published anything ever. Every

02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:22.227
great leader accomplished

02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:28.734
accomplice. It's never ever is

02:13:28.800 --> 02:13:32.337
listen ever in any way. Any

02:13:32.404 --> 02:13:36.475
land. Everyone has the right to

02:13:36.541 --> 02:13:40.479
test. Jeff said. Organizations

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:43.248
a form and they want to get

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:45.751
together one response because

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:47.786
they know they're going to get

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:48.353
a response if not there. Who

02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:55.227
were. Protesting they're

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:58.397
talking to themselves. When it

02:13:58.463 --> 02:14:01.299
comes to. Thirty I'm sorry. Yes

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:06.738
against protests. It there's

02:14:06.805 --> 02:14:09.174
nothing wrong with protests we

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:09.808
are at this point where we are

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:13.512
in this nation you have indeed

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:15.881
who do not look like you in

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.816
positions that would. Have

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:20.719
been. Forty fifty six years ago.

02:14:20.786 --> 02:14:29.060
At all the- I'm fortunate. Sir

02:14:29.127 --> 02:14:29.661
because there was a time that

02:14:29.728 --> 02:14:30.295
somebody look like me was not a

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:30.929
law enforcement officer it just

02:14:30.996 --> 02:14:32.497
wasn't I'm for it because we

02:14:32.564 --> 02:14:32.998
have individuals who are

02:14:33.064 --> 02:14:39.504
status. Members. Nor would not

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:42.808
look like you are aye. For it

02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:47.679
is the what. This single life

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:48.280
matters when the numbers of

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:51.550
statistics when they come out

02:14:51.616 --> 02:14:52.184
it's not popular to say that is

02:14:52.250 --> 02:14:55.220
the test. Police officers

02:14:55.287 --> 02:14:59.458
search more white Americans.

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:02.561
It's not it's not popular about

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:03.128
that you can have a shooting

02:15:03.195 --> 02:15:05.130
somewhere in our nation the

02:15:05.197 --> 02:15:08.066
media is only gonna show one

02:15:08.133 --> 02:15:08.600
aspect. They will show on

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:15.140
others. Sir. All I will also

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:17.476
tell you this everything was

02:15:17.542 --> 02:15:19.444
shooting every in every every

02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:20.078
incident. Late you have to look

02:15:20.145 --> 02:15:26.184
at. Independently it's not all

02:15:26.251 --> 02:15:26.818
down in the- it happened within

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:33.391
in the word. Or New York or

02:15:33.458 --> 02:15:36.361
Florida or county San Marino.

02:15:36.428 --> 02:15:36.962
You can't love everything the

02:15:37.028 --> 02:15:41.132
same. All protest. Because what

02:15:41.199 --> 02:15:42.300
at the other day every does

02:15:42.367 --> 02:15:48.874
matter if. Bill especially he

02:15:48.940 --> 02:15:51.443
is more. We're off to my

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:53.979
department in our jail. The

02:15:54.045 --> 02:15:55.947
certain sees before we have

02:15:56.014 --> 02:16:01.620
more calling from. Bernard job

02:16:01.686 --> 02:16:04.723
duties all the more officers

02:16:04.789 --> 02:16:06.391
but we don't talk about that.

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:08.960
Life is a life and it doesn't.

02:16:09.027 --> 02:16:11.162
It is a thousand watt told or

02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:15.300
one life a mother fears of

02:16:15.367 --> 02:16:15.901
every race. Is still hurting.

02:16:15.967 --> 02:16:22.741
Thank you for the answer. The

02:16:22.807 --> 02:16:23.341
cut off but we were given the

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:26.745
room until fifteen. The court

02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:33.218
also. A major. We had Randall

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.986

possible but we do want. Okay.

Users about- then in a or

02:16:52.904 --> 02:16:56.841
whatever believe that but. Time

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:59.711
we said it seems like we get

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:05.283
our hands. And we put that the

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:05.884
police officers at the we get

02:17:05.951 --> 02:17:10.755
shot. Free. Stand up and others

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:14.693
have when I get this so. And

02:17:14.759 --> 02:17:16.227
it's possible to answer that

02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:19.230
question hopefully but assembly

02:17:19.297 --> 02:17:19.764

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:20.465

and I appreciate you asking and

02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:22.801

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:30.408
am Cooper co author of that

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:30.976
bill. That was signed by the

02:17:31.042 --> 02:17:33.144
governor this year. Changing

02:17:33.211 --> 02:17:36.948
the law. How police should act

02:17:37.015 --> 02:17:40.885

the curb you know because they

02:17:48.526 --> 02:17:51.429
were in the wrong place and

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:52.564
they were the wrong color so I

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:57.402
respect. Your quest. I know

02:18:01.673 --> 02:18:04.542
about it- for many more hours.

02:18:04.609 --> 02:18:06.611
I think Skinner questions.

02:18:06.678 --> 02:18:10.382
Assembly. Trying to address the

02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:12.183
issue that you bring up. Thank

02:18:12.250 --> 02:18:14.953
you. The last we have sage

02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:21.893
keener. Hello I'm sage Greiner

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.527
two questions I'm sorry I know

02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:24.195
it's gonna be a little shorter-

02:18:24.262 --> 02:18:26.665
once reject that- throughout

02:18:26.731 --> 02:18:30.268
your prison he referred to the

02:18:30.335 --> 02:18:32.570
national socialist movement as

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:35.974
Martin these organs and what.

02:18:36.041 --> 02:18:37.242
Is the frequently a man I can I

02:18:37.308 --> 02:18:40.779
have a question rather rather

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:41.346
as saying this the organ is

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:44.949
once a part of- is a particular

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:50.422
reason why you. Said that. Or

02:18:50.488 --> 02:18:53.158
is any reason behind it. That's

02:18:53.224 --> 02:18:53.792
a good question now it force I

02:18:53.858 --> 02:18:55.460
haven't. Times are when I'm

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:55.994
Madera creek say my former

02:18:56.061 --> 02:18:59.731
organization. Very very clear.

02:18:59.798 --> 02:19:00.331
It is my former realization I

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:00.899
have nothing to do with the

02:19:00.965 --> 02:19:04.803
organisers. Thank you I'll be

02:19:04.869 --> 02:19:07.338
more mindful thank you. And my

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:11.476
sense is first after. You had

02:19:11.543 --> 02:19:12.043
said but of what they're not

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:16.915
another. He crimes that happen.

02:19:16.981 --> 02:19:22.020
But for being honest and-

02:19:22.087 --> 02:19:23.555
respect all enforcement. Is

02:19:23.621 --> 02:19:24.189
there project and while there's

02:19:24.255 --> 02:19:35.567
no urgency. AB props there's

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:40.004
reasons with- but they have not

02:19:40.071 --> 02:19:41.940
mother the rest is it as we- as

02:19:42.006 --> 02:19:45.677
a society. That is pushed aside

02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:54.652
more times and often. It's not

02:19:54.719 --> 02:19:57.288
just for your notes. But I can.

02:19:57.355 --> 02:20:02.393
When. The call for service they

02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:09.601
need right now. Our. We

02:20:09.667 --> 02:20:10.101
anything unless somebody

02:20:10.168 --> 02:20:10.668
reported so that's the first

02:20:10.735 --> 02:20:14.973
set to report it. I don't have

02:20:15.039 --> 02:20:15.573
an answer we would not want to

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:24.315
report something. Right. And

02:20:24.382 --> 02:20:27.051
that's the best thing I can say.

02:20:27.118 --> 02:20:29.988
Just real for the first. Your

02:20:30.054 --> 02:20:33.324

02:20:33.391 --> 02:20:35.059
years fifty four now report we

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:39.097

the reporting among Latinos

02:20:58.416 --> 02:21:00.418
