THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES WITH THEIR FEEDBACK RESERVE JUST A LITTLE BIT. WHAT YOU KEEP TALKING WILL SEE I THINK THAT YOU'RE JUST AN EDGE BUT IT PERSISTS WILL TAKE A PAUSE BUT WHAT IS CONTINUE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY APPRECIATE A- SENATE BILL ONE ISN'T. SENATE BILL ONE TEN OKAY THAT'S BETTER OKAY. CORRECT SENATE BILL ONE TEN THE RECOVERY INCENTIVES ARE GONE IS A HARM REDUCTION PUBLIC HEALTH BILL THAT SIMPLY REQUIRES A CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS BE REIMBURSABLE. BY MEDICARE ALL OF THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS NOT IN VIOLATION OF STATE ANTI KICKBACK LAWS FOR HEALTH TREATMENTS. CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN FORM OF BEHAVIORAL BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION THAT USES POSITIVE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO OBTAIN FROM DRUG USE AND TO REMAIN IN DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS- THE- THE VA- THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- CURRENTLY USES CONTINUE TO MANAGEMENT IN THE VA HAS DONE SO SUCCESSFULLY. FOR ABOUT A DECADE- ACROSS CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY DURING COVERT NINETEEN SUBSTANCE USE HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO DRUG USE AND OVERDOSES ARE ALL SKYROCKETING OVERDOSE DEATHS IN PARTICULAR HAVE GONE OFF THE CHARTS- LAST YEAR ALMOST FORTY THOUSAND AMERICANS DIED OF OVERDOSE DEATHS. FIVE MATH IN PARTICULAR- IS RAVAGING OUR COMMUNITIES IN MY OWN DISTRICTS- MATH IS INVOLVED IN A MAJORITY OF OVERDOSE DEATHS AND MATH RELATED HOSPITAL VISITS HAVE JUMPED OVER 6100% BETWEEN. TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. BECAUSE CURRENT NO IN- FOR METHOD WE HOPE THAT TO SOME POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT AS OF NOW THERE'S NO MEDICAL INTERVENTION- WE MUST TURN TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO SAVE LIVES AND HELP PEOPLE TO ABSTAINED. BY CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A PROVEN METHOD TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE THAT IS A KEY TOOL AND INTERESTING AND ADDRESSING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PARTICULARLY FOR MATH AND OTHER STIMULANTS. AS AN EXAMPLE A CLINIC THAT OPERATES A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM- IT MAY OPERATE A CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION PROGRAM IN WHICH A PARTICIPANT COULD RECEIVE GIFT CARDS OR VOUCHERS IN EXCHANGE FOR NEGATIVE URINE TESTS OR TREATMENT PARTICIPATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS. I PERSONALLY KNOW SOMEONE IN SAN FRANCISCO'S A VERY PUBLIC ABOUT THIS WHO IS BADLY ADDICTED TO MATH AND HE PARTICIPATED IN A CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHERE YOU WOULD URINATE A COP EVERY WEEK AND EVERY TIME THE TEST WAS NEGATIVE HE RECEIVED SEVEN DOLLARS. THAT WAS ENOUGH OF AN INCENTIVE TO KEEP HIM ON TRACK AND HE'S BEEN SOBER. FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME NOW- BY CREATING A- INCENTIVE FOR PATIENTS TO STOP USING DRUGS AND RETURNS A DRUG TREATMENT. CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A STRONG TOOL THAT PROVABLY IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES- THIS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL THE PARTICULAR AS WE COME OUT OF THE PEN AND US. HELP PEOPLE- STOP USING AND STOP- AND GET HEALTHY- WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE ADDICTION WORSE HAS MEETINGS IT DEPRESSION OTHER MENTAL HEALTH- WORSE- WE NEED TO TAKE PROACTIVE. STEPS I WOULD TO ALSO NOTE THAT RECENTLY THE BINDING HARRIS. ISSUED A STATEMENT ON A DRUG POLICY PRIORITIES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF ADMINISTRATION- I WANT TO QUOTE IN THAT FROM THE PLAN ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES THIS CALL I AND ADDRESS POLICY BARRIERS RELATED TO CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR STIMULANT USE DISORDER AND EXPLORE REIMBURSEMENT FOR MOTIVATIONAL INCENTIVES AND DIGITAL TREATMENT FOR ADDICTION ESPECIALLY STIMULANT USE DISORDER LEVINE ADMINISTRATION IS ADVOCATING FOR EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE. TODAY THIS PROVEN INTERVENTION- SB ONE TENDS NOT ESTABLISH ANY PROGRAMS ARE SET UP PARTICULAR FORMS OF CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT BUT SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT IT'S LEGAL AND AUTHORIZES MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION OF QUALITY CALIFORNIA CALPERS THREE SIXTY- AND OTHER- REALLY ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ADDICTION ORGANIZATIONS- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE TYRONE CLIFFORD THERE WAS A COUNSELOR AT THE STONE WALL PROJECT WHICH IS A PROGRAM OF THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION.

THANK YOU NOW LET'S MOVE ON THE SHOPTALK YES PLEASE BEGIN YEAH THIS IS. YEAH THIS IS DOCTOR STEVE SHOP SO I'M A PROFESSOR OF FAMILY MEDICINE HERE UCLA- ACTUALLY HELPED DEVELOP THE PRODUCT PROJECTS IN SAN FRANCISCO ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO- I THINK THE TWO THINGS I WANT TO SAY IS TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE THE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IS A TREATMENT. IT'S NOT JUST PAYING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO IT ANYWAY. IF NOW YOU'VE- EXECUTIVE WHILE MARK TWAIN STIMULANT ABSTINENCE AND THAT'S THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS EACH TIME. IT'S AN EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS MANY OF WHOM ARE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR SO IT'S TIME THAT THIS TREATMENT COMES INTO THE TREATMENT SYSTEM. IT'S FLEXIBLE IT CAN BE USED DELIVERED USING VOUCHERS OR CAN BE DELIVERED USING A FISH BALL- IT IT IT IS EVIDENCE BASED AND ALL OF THE DATA ARE CONSISTENT TO SHOW IT WORKS. PERFECT SIZE OF THIS TREATMENT IS THAN THE MODERATE TO HIGH EFFECT SIZE RANGE POINT QUARTER POINT SIX. WHICH IS ABOUT THE SAME EFFECT SIZE FOR MOST ANTIBIOTICS BETTER TREAT USED TO TREAT INFECTIONS- THIS STANDARD IS AROUND THE WORLD I'VE DONE WORK WITH CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT IN SOUTH AFRICA AND THE SAME LEVEL OF THE FACT. THAT IF CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT WERE A MEDICATION IT WOULD BE THE STANDARD OF CARE- AS NOTED ALREADY IS THE STANDARD OF CARE IN THE VA AND WE NEED TO BRING IT FORWARD. AND RAMP IT UP. THIS SHOWS WE CAN. MANAGED WORKS RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS CAN INCENTIVES ARE SPENT THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND WHAT WE SHE'D SEEN IS THE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT HELPS REVERSE THE KEY PART OF ADDICTION TO METHAMPHETAMINE THAT INVOLVES MAKING DECISIONS OF RISK THAT IS AVOIDING DRUGS.

AT THE TIME WE HAVE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MR THANK YOU MODERATOR NOW WILL BRING IT BACK TO TOO MANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SIR EGGMAN IS MOVED THE BILL CENTER GROVE. YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE JUST A FEW QUESTIONS- ON THE SURFACE SENATOR WIENER I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL- BECAUSE I THINK INCENTIVES WILL HELP INDIVIDUALS- YOU KNOW GET OFF DRUGS LEAD TO MORE PRODUCTIVE LIFE. I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE'S NO INFORMATION HERE ABOUT THE INCENTIVES LIKE I MEAN IS IT A FIVE DOLLAR GIFT CARD THEY STAY CLEAN FOR THIRTY DAYS OR IS IT A THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF THEY STAY CLEAN FOR A WEEK SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF INCENTIVES AND WHAT THE PARAMETERS SURROUNDING THAT. SO THE BILL DOES NOT LIKE MICROMANAGE THE EXACT CONTOURS OF THE PROGRAM'S DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO A DIFFERENT WAY. WAYS THE BILL HAS TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT'S A SAYS THAT IT'S LEGAL WHAT WE THINK IT. WE THINK IT ALREADY HAS BUT- THERE IS SOME AGENCIES THINKER IS NOT. ON AND THEN IT AUTHORIZES MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IS ACTUALLY ALREADY LOOKING AT THIS- POSITIVE ABOUT IT AND T. H. SEE- SOMATIC CAL WOULD SET A REIMBURSEMENT SCHEDULE. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT THAT WILL CONTAIN- COPS IN OUR PRESUME THAT IT WOULD BE TEN CAPS. BUT IN TERMS OF THESE PROGRAMS WORK I MENTIONED- THAT AT THE BEGINNING. OF THE SOMEONE. I KNOW IN SERVICES GO WHO WAS VERY ADDICTED TO METH. HE WORRIES HE WOULD KEY IN A CAR OR HAVING YOUR NAY. COP EVERY WEK AND IT WAS NEGATIVE HE WOULD GET SEVEN DOLLARS- THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS- I'M AWARE OF WHERE THEY'LL GET. A TWENTY OR THIRTY DOLLAR GIFT CARD SAID A SAFE WAY- THERE- THE- YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM I BELIEVE THE PROGRAM OF THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION. COBB SALAD SOMETHING LIKE THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. OVER A MULTI MONTH PERIOD SO TYPICALLY THESE ARE. PAYMENTS SECOND AS LOW AS SEVENTY TEN DOLLARS OR MAYBE TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS AND YOU GET IT LIKE ONCE A WEEK TYPICALLY MAYBE ONCE A WEEK OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS. ON IT'S NOT A PERMANENT PROGRAM THE PROGRAM AND- AND IT'S PROBABLY CUTS. OUT AROUND A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS. M. I. APRIL THAT I. SEE ANY OF THE IN THE- I SEE IF OR CEILING- FOR THE REMEMBER THE REIMBURSEMENT OR THE AWARD I DIDN'T SEE A FLOOR OR A CEILING. AND I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ON M. ON A TERMINATION DATE OR A DATE THAT WERE. YOU KNOW WOULD GO ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY SO- AND I KNOW THAT'S YOUR INTENT. I JUST I AM. I LIKE THE IDEA BUT I HAVE TO VOTE ON THE BILL BEFORE ME AND IT I JUST DON'T SEE THAT IN THE BILL. I AM. WE I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO INCLUDE THAT LEVEL OF MICROMANAGEMENT IN THE BILL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WORK IN DIFFERENT WAYS- DH CS WILL HAVE EVERY ABILITY TO DEFINE CONTOURS OF REIMBURSEMENT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW MAXIM MORE MINIMUMS- ANDS- AND SO I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'LL BE AN ISSUE AND I WOULD PERSICO. UNCOMFORTABLE INCLUDING THAT LEVEL OF MICROMANAGEMENT IN THE BILL WERE SIMPLY SAYING BROADLY THAT MEDIC CAL IS AUTHORIZED TO DO THIS- AND THE MEDIC CAL WORK OUT ALL THE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT WILL LOOK LIKE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE AND THE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THE BILL. OKAY SAYING NONE- RIGHT SAY NONE AT SERRA WINNER AT APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AGAIN AS YOU POINTED OUT THIS IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH- I LISTEN MAKE NOTE THAT- BELIEVES INTENDED TO BILLS TO CLARIFY BECAUSE OF SOME QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT WHETHER. OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM CAN ACTUALLY DO THIS AND- THIS- BILL DOES CLARIFY THAT QUESTION. WELL O I APPRECIATE THAT'S WHAT THE BILL'S DOING- WOULD WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I RESPECTFULLY AS FROM A VOTE OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- SO THIS BILL IS A BEEN MOVED BY CENTER EGGMAN THE MOTIONS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS--CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CAN HI CAN I MELINDA'S. EGGMAN RIGHT EGGMAN I AND SALAS HI AND SALAS I GREW. HER TADO. LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE LIMóN ROTH HI ROTH AYE RUBIO AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE. SO THE CURRENT VOTE SEVEN ZERO PUT THE BILL ON CALL THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TWO SB THREE SEVENTY NINE AGAIN BY CENTER WIENER. THESE AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES SENATE BILL THREE SEVENTY NINE- PROHIBITS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM. FROM ENTERING INTO ANY CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER HEALTH FACILITY. THAT LIMITS THE SERVICES THAT YOU SEE PHYSICIANS- AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE. TO PATIENTS- BASED ON NONCLINICAL OFTEN DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIONS ON CARE. IN OTHER WORDS THE BILL WILL ENSURE THE UC PHYSICIANS. AND PROVIDERS EVEN IF THEY ARE AN AFFILIATED HOSPITAL. CAN PROVIDE WHATEVER TREATMENT THEY THINK IS APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PATIENT. WITHOUT BEING BOUND BY NON SCIENCE BASED- TREATMENT RESTRICTIONS. ARE YOU SEE HEALTH SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE BEST HEALTH SYSTEMS IN OUR NATION AND FRANKLY THE WORLD. HAS WORLD RENOWNED LEADERSHIP AND REPRODUCTIVE. AND LGBTQ TWO INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE. ARE YOU SEE YOU SEE TRULY EMBODIES CALIFORNIA PROGRESSIVE VALUES AROUND HEALTH CARE ACCESS. UCHEALTH IS ALSO THE FOURTH LARGEST HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. YOU SEE RECEIVED NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN. STATE FUNDING- AND PLAYS A CENTRAL ROLE IN TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION. OF PHYSICIANS. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE TREATED BY UC. PROVIDERS EVERY YEAR. AND ONE OF UC'S CORE VALUES IS INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE. THE NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE THE MATTER HOW MARGINALIZED YOU ARE. NO MATTER WHAT. NO MATTER THAT SOCIETY MAY HAVE WRITTEN YOU OFF YOU WILL GET HEALTH. IN PARTICULAR. IN PARTICULAR YOU SEE POVIDES STRONG ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE. HEALTH CARE AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. DESPITE THE CORE VALUE USE HEALTH HAS A INTO PHILLY BECAUSE- EARLY PLANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THESE CONTRACTS OVER TIME WITH HEALTHCARE FACILITIES THAT IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON MEDICAL CARE THAT ARE NOT BASED ON SCIENCE OR ANY CLINICAL CRITERIA. THESE RESTRICTIONS CAN BE BASED ON POLITICAL VIEW FOR EXAMPLE HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT IS POLITICALLY OPPOSED TO CERTAIN PROCEDURES IT CAN BE BASED ON RELIGIOUS VIEWS FOR EXAMPLE BISHOP HAS DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN HEALTH CARE VIOLATES RELIGIOUS DOCTRINE OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE NOT BASED IN SCIENCE OR CLINICAL DECISION MAKING. AS PART OF UC'S CONTRACT WITH THESE HOSPITALS YOU SEE PHYSICIANS AND NURSES AND MEDICAL STUDENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM PERFORMING CERTAIN HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU SEE PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE PRACTICING AND IS AFFILIATED HOSPITALS SO YOU SEE THE PHYSICIAN PUBLIC EMPLOYEE. IS BOUND BY THOSE NON SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS. ON SPECIFICALLY OF THE RESTRICTIVE CONTRACTS AT UC HEALTH HAS ENTERED INTO EXPLICITLY PREVENT YOU SEE DOCTORS AND STUDENTS FROM FOR EXAMPLE. BY TREATING A MISCARRIAGE ON THE IN AND THE SITUATION WHERE IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE QUOTE UNQOTE AN ABORTION IF THERE'S STILL A FETAL HEARTBEAT AND REQUIRING A PARENT TO CERTAIN TURMOIL UNTIL THE HEARTBEAT STOPS- PROVIDING EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION TO SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. FORMING A TUBAL LIGATION- WALL A WOMAN IS HAVING A C. SECTION- PERFORMING SURGERY TO ADDRESS AN ECTOPIC PREGNANCY AND YOU'LL HEAR SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT SITUATION TODAY. INSERTING AN IUD INTO A WOMAN PROVIDING SPECIFIC CARE TO TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE DENYING HYSTERECTOMIES AT HOSPITALS WITH RESTRICTIONS. TO TRANSGENDER PATIENTS EVEN THOSE HOSPITALS THAT REGULARLY PERMIT HYSTERECTOMIES FOR OTHER PATIENTS. THESE RESTRICTIONS AND DANGER LIVES THEY DENIED BASIC HEALTH CARE OF THE UC POSITION POLICE IS APPROPRIATE. THIS CONTRACTING PROCESS HAS BEEN DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS WITH LIMITED PUBLIC INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON BASIC PREVENTATIVE CARE AND URGENT CARE. THESE DECISIONS HAVE LEFT PATIENTS ADVOCATES AND LAWMAKERS AND EVEN PHYSICIANS IN THE DARK ON WHAT THESE CONTRACTS MEAN FOR PATIENT CARE. OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YOU SEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE SIGNED AN OPEN LETTER EXPRESSING THEIR OPPOSITION TO THESE DISCRIMINATORY RESTRICTIONS ON UC PRACTITIONERS. AND FACILITIES WITH NONCLINICAL NON SCIENCE BASED HEALTH CARE RESTRICTIONS TONIGHT BASIC CARE AND THIS HAS TO CHANGE OF DISPROPORTIONATELY AS ALWAYS HARMS LOW INCOME PEOPLE. ON OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION CALLERS OBIANO SEE OPPOSITION LETTERS WE RECEIVED AND THE LETTER OF CONCERN FROM YOU SEE HAS NOT BEEN STRAIGHTFORWARD IF YOU READ THE LETTER QUICKLY YOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER. AND IT BARELY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MAYBE THERE IS BUT THESE ARE SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF YOU SEE PRACTITIONERS TO PROVIDE CARE THAT THEY NEED. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL WAS NOT A RUSH BILL. THE UC HAS HAD YEARS AND YEARS TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM THERE HAVE BEEN WORKING COMMITTEES AND ROUND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF DISCUSSIONS FOR YEARS BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A KNOWN ISSUE. AND TODAY YOU SEE HAS NOT RESULTED YOU SEE DID MAKE A CHANGE TO AND THE SO CALLED GAG RULE BECAUSE IT USED TO BE THAT THESE HOSPITALS WOULD EVEN ARE YOU SEE PRACTITIONER. WOULD NOT EVEN BE ALLOWED TO TELL TO TELL A PATIENT THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A TUBAL LIGATION OR SEE GENDER AFFIRMING CARETHEY WEREN'T EVEN ALLOWED TO SAY IT OR MAKE A REFERRAL THAT AT LEAST HAD ENDED AND THAT'S GOOD. BUT THEY STILL CAN'T PROVIDE ON THE ACTUAL TREATMENT. AND SO YOU KNOW WE WE'VE BEEN GOING ON AND AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND THE COMMUNITY HAS OF YOU SEE FOR YEARS NOW AND NOTHING. OR VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED AND WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IF WE DON'T SET A POLICY IN PLACE NOW. WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW A VERY TINY PERCENTAGE OF YOU SEE PATIENTS ARE SUBJECT ARE A PART OF THESE AFFILIATIONS AND SMALL NOW. BUT IT'S GOING TO GROW AND NOW IS THE TIME TO SET THE GROUND RULES AND TO MAKE CLEAR THAT YOU SEE VALUES THE CALIFORNIA VALUES. MEAN THAT PEOPLE GET THE ACCESS TO CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THAT WE DON'T BIND. ARE YOU SEE PRACTITIONERS ARE WITH THESE NON SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS. ON THIS LEGISLATION SENATE SPONSOR BY A CALL CAL. NAY ROLE PRO CHOICE IT CAN. PLEASE TELL. AND IT IS BY THE PARA HEALTH ACCESS. AND A LARGE NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS. FOCUSED ON REPRODUCTIVE AND LGBTQ INCLUSIVE HEALTH CARE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY OR NOT THE DOCTOR JODY STEINHAUER WHO IS A PROFESSOR OF OUT OF STOCK STAR TREK'S CONCHOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SCIENCES. AND DIRECTOR OF THE DIXIE CENTER FOR GLOBAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AS WELL AS MADDY WHO- WHO ELSE JUST USE HER FIRST NAME WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY WHO HAS BEEN IMPACTED. BY THESE POLICIES- AND- THANK AND WE ALSO ELIZABETH KILL FROM THE ACLU WHO WILL BE AVAILABLE AT CERTAIN TECHNICAL QUESTIONS COME UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER- MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON TO LINE DR JUDY STEIN OUR AND MADDIE- BASICALLY WE OF YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES BUT THERE'S A TOTAL FOUR MINUTES- SO- DOCTOR SIGN ARE YOU BECAUSE YOU BEGIN I WILL GIVE A TWO MINUTE WARNING YOU GET TWO MINUTES BUT- THAT HE- EVERY SECOND AFTER THAT AND TAKES AWAY FROM MATTIE'S TESTIMONY TIME SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO WITH TE MAXIMUM FOUR MINUTES- SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE BEGIN WITH- DOCTOR JODY STEINHAUER AND THEN FOLLOWED BY MADDIE SO DR STEIN OUR. HI MY NAME IS DR JODY STEINHAUER I'M AN OBSTETRICIAN GYNECOLOGIST AND DIRECTOR OF THE BIG THE CENTER FOR GLOBAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. I THINK YOU SEE FOR MORE THAN THREE DECADES BEGINNING WHEN I WAS AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ENTERING MEDICAL SCHOOL RESIDENCY AND GRADUATE TRAINING IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. I STATE IT YOU SEE BECAUSE OF THE VALUES THAT GROUND OUR WORK WE PROVIDE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF EVIDENCE BASED CARE TO ALL PATIENTS. I'M TESTIFYING BECAUSE I'M DISTRESSED BY YOU COULD CONTRACT THAT REQUIRE YOU SEE MEDICAL PROVIDERS TO LIMIT THE CARE WE PROVIDE PATIENTS WHICH NOT ONLY CONTRADICTS OUR VALUES BUT ALSO HARMS TRAINEES AND THEIR FUTURE PATIENTS. ARE YOU SEE TRAINING NOT ONE PATIENT CENTERED EVIDENCE BASED CARE. THEY CAN'T DO THAT IN CLINICAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT RESTRICT THEM FROM PROVIDING BASIC STANDARD OF CARE TREATMENTS. WE KNOW FROM STUDIES AT MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE DONE. THE PEOPLE TRAINED IN HOSPITALS THAT RESTRICT THEM FROM PROVIDING FAMILY PLANNING CARE DO NOT LEARN THE BASIC SKILLS THEY SHOULD. THE STUDY SAID THAT MANY MEDICAL STUDENTS GRADUATE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO COUNSEL SOMEONE ABOUT ALL CONTRACEPTIVE OPTIONS. AND MANY OF THE YOUNG RESIDENTS DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE PLACING AN IED OR. DOING POSTPARTUM STERILIZATION. BECAUSE MOST TRAIN STATE HEALTHCARE. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT ON THEIR FUTURE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS. AMPLE WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO PUT PRINCIPLE LIGATION ACTIVISION WHO TRAINED IN A RESTRICTED SETTING MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IT I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT HALF OF WOMEN WHO AREN'T ABLE TO HAVE THEIR DESIRED POSTPARTUM STERILIZATION. APPLE BECAUSE OF RESTRICTED HOSPITAL POLICY I HAVEN'T UNINTENDED PREGNANCY WITHIN ONE YEAR. EVERYONE DESERVES ACCESS TO THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF CARE WHICH IS NOT GOING TO FUTURE THE DC CARE IN WHICH WE GIVE LEICESTER CARE TO UNDERSERVED PATIENTS AND WE SHOULD NOT PUT OUR YOUTH THE CLINICIANS AND TRAINEES IN A POSITION WHERE THEY ARE FORCED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANDARD CARE SHE- ASKED SB THREE SEVEN NINE TO ENSURE YOU SEE REMAIN TRUE TO OUR VALUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANNOUNCED BRING ON MADDY. ON THE LINE. ANY ANY YES PLEASE BEGAN. HELLO CARE AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS NOT IN ON THE TWENTY THIRD TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLD LIFETIME CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BORN AND RAISED IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY IN JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AFTER SPENDING OVER FOUR HOURS WAITING IN CRIPPLING PAIN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM HM HOSPITAL THE ONLY E. ARE WORRIED THAT THEY WOULD DISCOVER THAT I WAS PREGNANT. AFTER EVEN MORE. OUR OF TESTING. AND PRODDING MY DOCTORS DETERMINED THAT I HAD SEVERE INTERNAL BLEEDING CAUSED BY A RUPTURED ECTOPIC PREGNANCY AND WOULD REQUIRE EMERGENCY SURGERY. BUT THEN I CONTINUE TO WAIT. ONLY AFTER HOURS IN DELAYS WHEN IT BECAME EVIDENT THAT MY CONDITION WAS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING THE ABLE TO GET A LIFESAVING CARE THAT NEED. THE NEXT DAY WALKED PROCESS THE TRAUMA I UNDERWENT. SURGERY I ALSO MY SURGERY HAD BEEN DELAYED ESPECIALLY I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT WOULD MERGING. ONLY THEN DID I LEARN THAT ACCORDING THANK JOSEPH TALK POLICY SURGERY WAS CONSIDERED AN ABORTION. IT BECAME CLEAR THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY RECORD THE LOOKING INTO PUBLIC HOURS AND INTERNAL BLEEDING AND PAIN. I KIND CONSERVE KERR WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED DUE DUE TO THE RESTRICTIVE POLICIES THE THING JUST. CALL MY EXPERIENCE WAS FAR MORE TERRIFYING PAINFUL AND TRAUMATIZING THAN ANYONE. IN MY SITUATION SHOULD HAVE. BUT I LEARNED THAT OTHER ABOUT SIMILAR EXPERIENCE WE CAN RECONNECT AND GENDER AFFIRMING CARE. ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE INCLUDING ABORTION IS A RIGHT. NOT A LUXURY RESERVED FOR THOSE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN AN AREA WITH MULTIPLE HEALTH CARE OPTIONS. I LIKE SHOULDN'T BE PUT AT RISK BECAUSE OF A HOSPITAL'S NONMEDICAL IDEOLOGICAL RESTRICTIONS. AND THE STANDARD OF CARE I RECEIVED SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON WHETHER I LIVE IN HUMBOLDT- LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

THE TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON SALLY SLINGER WITH DIGNITY HEALTH. SB THREE SEVENTY NINE WILL NOT EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. HE WILL END PARTNERSHIPS THAT SAVE LIVES. IT UNDERMINES RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THAT TRAIN DOCTORS TO PRACTICE TO THE FULL SCOPE OF THEIR SPECIALTIES. AND SERVE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. DEVASTATED A MEDIC CAL SAFETY NET WHICH IS A LIFELINE FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THERE ARE MANY MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FAITH BASED PROVIDERS AND I'M HERE TO REPLACE THEM WITH THE BACK. DIGNITY HEALTH SERVICES EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF ETHNICITY INCOME IMMIGRATION STATUS SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER IDENTITY WE CARE FOR THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING THAT ST FRANCIS GENDER INSTITUTE THAT SERVES TRANSGENDER PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE ALWAYS DELIVERED EXCEPTIONAL CARE TO CALIFORNIA'S MINORITY AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE ELECTIVE STERILIZATION OR ELECTIVE ABORTIONS BUT WE ABSOLUTELY RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR PATIENTS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS IN CONSULTATION WITH THEIR PHYSICIANS AND REFERRED THEM TO OTHER PROVIDERS IT IS A SERVICE WE DO NOT PROVIDE. AND WE WILL ALWAYS ACT IMMEDIATELY AND PROVIDE ANY NECESSARY SERVICE TO PROTECT THE LIVES OF OUR PATIENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION. NOTHING IN THREE SEVENTY NINE EXPANDS ACCESS TO CARE FOR WOMEN LGBTQ PLUS CALIFORNIANS OR ANYONE ELSE. ELIMINATING UC PARTNERSHIPS ARE HARMS PHYSICIAN RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND HEALTH SERVICES IN EVERY DISTRICT. UNDER SEC. THREE SEVENTY NINE NO ONE WINS AND EVERYONE LOSES PLEASE VOTE NO TO PROTECT ACCESS EQUITY AND QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH NOW LET'S BRING ON- DR CARRIE BYINGTON FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. TWO MINUTES.

I THANK BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR FOR ENGAGING DIRECTLY WITH YOU SEE. YOU SEE HEALTH IS AN ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF ALL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AT SUCH WE ARE COMMITTED TO ELIMINATING DISCRIMINATION EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CARE AND ENSURING PERSONAL HEALTH CARE DECISIONS REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS. THE UNIVERSITY IS OPPOSED TO THE USE OF NON MEDICAL POLICIES TO DETERMINE PROPER CARE. AGE RESTRICTIONS ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH MY RESPONSIBILITIES AS A PHYSICIAN AND AS THE LEADER OF YOU SEE HEALTH. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT PROHIBITING YOU SEE THE FILIATION WITH POLICY BASED APOLOGY RESTRICTED INSTITUTION WILL NOT CHANGE THE PRACTICES. CERTAINLY NO PERSON WILL RECEIVE MORE CARE OR BETTER CARE IF OUR DELINEATIONS ARE DISCONTINUED. TO THE CONTRARY LOW INCOME AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL HAVE LESS ACCESS TO CARE WE BELIEVE THIS IS UNFAIR IN SOME INSTANCES WILL BE LIFE THREATENING AND EXACERBATES HEALTH DISPARITIES. ENGAGEMENT RATHER THAN ISOLATION OFFERS MORE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE CARE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT RELY ON YOU SEE AS A SAFETY NET. IF YOU'RE TAKING A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE GOAL OF THE AUTHOR WE HAVE AMENDED OUR CONTRACT WITH POLICY RESTRICTED PROVIDERS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT OUR PHYSICIANS AND TRAINEES ARE PROTECTED IN THEIR ABILITY TO ADVICE PRESCRIBE REFER AND KEEP ACTIVE AND EMERGENCY WE HAVE REAFFIRMED THAT OUR PROVIDERS CAN ACT CONSISTENT WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AND THE WISHES OF THEIR PATIENTS. THERE IS NO GAG ORDER. WRESTLER CONCERN AT THE THREE SAN NINE NOT IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE CANNOT ABANDON THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES IN SEVENTY SEVEN LOCATIONS WITH NON FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE.

THERESA BECAUSE ANAK ATHEIST DEMOCRAT LGBTQ I A ALLY AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR LIFE HERE FRANCISCO IN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU EXLINE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE- PLEASE CONTINUE MR THANK YOU- THEY'LL BRING IT BACK TO OUR COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS CENTER GROVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CENTERING KERN COUNTY MERCY MEMORIAL HOSPITALS HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE BLOOD AND CANCER CENTER WHICH IS THE ONLY CANCER CENTER IN THE ENTIRE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT PARTICIPATES IN CLINICAL TRIALS. THROUGH THE UCLA CANCER CENTER- THREE UCLA CANCER CENTER PROGRAM- MY CONSTITUENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE STATE I'M RELY ON THIS PARTNERSHIP TO GET ACCESS TO INNOVATIVE CLINICAL TRIALS. I'M CONCERNED AND I DO BELIEVE THAT YOUR BILL WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR MAKING KIDS CONSTITUENTS IN THE CONSTITUENTS WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO GET THIS CANCER CARE. BECAUSE IT LIMITS THEIR- ACCESS TO FACILITY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO OTHER LOCATIONS- CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU THINK THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH A PREDOMINATELY LATINO POPULATION- AND- BASICALLY FROM NORTHERN STOCKTON ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ALMOST THE- GREAT FINE. HOW THIS IS GOING TO BENEFIT OF THE CONSTITUENTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IF THIS BILL PASSES AND MERCY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S DON'T. HAVE ACCESS TO THE UC'S AND STUDENTS. FOR INTERNSHIPS AND- NOT INTERNSHIPS BUT FOR RESIDENCIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE BLEEDING DIRECTOR AND- THE WHAT WOULD YOU GO AHEAD SPEAKER. SO IT SOUNDS REALLY DISTORTED YEAH THERE'S A LITTLE FEEDBACK GOING ON JUST NEED TO SPEAK CLOSELY INTO THE MARK FROM THREE OKAY FOR A BETTER I THINK THAT'S BETTER OKAY. I'LL DO THAT- DIGITAL PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY ASK ANY OF OUR ASPEN GOT SOFTER BUT I'LL GET LOUDER- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION OF CENTER GROVE. TO BE CRYSTAL CLEAR ON THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO AND AFFILIATIONS. I ACKNOWLEDGE WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AFFILIATIONS ARE ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND ACCESS. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ENDING AFFILIATIONS ON WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS UC NOT HAVING AFFILIATION CONTRACTS. LITERALLY PROHIBIT YOU SEE POSITION TO AT SARAH FROM PERFORMING CARE THAT THEY THINK IS NECESSARY. FOR THEIR PATIENTS. AND SO THE SOLUTION. IS FOR THOSE CONTRACTS NOT TO LIMIT THE ABILITY OF UC PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE CENTRAL VALLEY RESIDENTS WITH ALL APPROPRIATE CARE IT IS NOT IN THE INTERESTS OF ANYONE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR ELSEWHERE. TO GO AND SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN YOUR UC POSITION. AND THAT POSITION IS LIMITED IN THE KIND OF CARE THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO YOU THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. AND DOT DOT IS WHAT HARMS ACCESS. TO CARE AND SO IF YOU ARE SET FOR EXAMPLE- A RESIDENT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN YOUR WOMAN WHO'S HAVING A C. SECTION AND YOU WANT TO HAVE A TUBAL LIGATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT C. SECTION. RIGHT NOW YOUR UC PHYSICIAN MAY HAVE TO PERFORM THE C. SECTION. RENDON FINISHER NINE CLOSE YOU OUT. AND THEN SEND YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE TO HAVE A SECOND SURGERY TO DO THE TUBAL LIGATION WHICH IS VERY VERY HARMFUL TO A PATIENT INCREASE RISKS. AND NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE AND YET THAT IS WHAT. THE UC IS FORCING ITS PHYSICIANS TO DO BY ENTERING INTO THESE RESTRICTED AFFILIATIONS SO THAT IS THE SOLUTION. AND. SO I'VE BEEN TO A COUPLE HOSPITALS NOT ALL HOSPITALS FAITH BASED OR NOT FAITH BASED HOSPITALS OR NOT PROVIDE ALL THE SAME MEDICAL SERVICES DOES YOUR BILL REQUIRE OTHER HOSPITALS TO TAKE ON THE SERVICES THAT YOUR BILL WOULD SHUT DOWN IN THESE FAITH BASED HOSPITALS. IT SEEMS- NOT EQUITABLE IF OTHER HOSPITALS THAT THE THAT DON'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT THESE- THESE FAITH BASED OR CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS PROVIDE- IF THEY'RE NOT ROVIDING THOSE SERVICES IT'S KIND OF A AND COUNTER ARGUMENT TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YOU KNOW THESE HOSPITALS PROVIDE EXTENSIVE SERVICES AND CANCER TREATMENTS CANCER AND CLINICAL TRIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND IF OTHER HOSPITALS IN THE STATE THAT ARE NOT FAITH BASED. DON'T PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IT'S KIND OF COUNTER. PRODUCTIVE TO THIS BILL IF YOU'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE FACILITIES THAT DO PROVIDE THIS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A- WHAT THEY CONSIDER I THINK A AND ESTABLISHMENT OF A. I HAVE I DON'T SEE RULES BUT AND ESTABLISHMENT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF CONSCIENCE I GUESS- AND SO IT DOES THE BILL REQUIRE OTHER HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICES THAT ARE IN THESE OTHER HOW THE FAITH BASED HOSPITALS THAT SO CARE IS CONSISTENT AND WE DON'T LOSE. ALL THE CARE THAT WE GET IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ON DISPUTE DURING THE PROMISE THAT THIS IS GONNA- BECAUSE CENTRAL VALLEY PATIENTS TO LOSE THEIR CARE. THE BILL ON REQUIRES DOES NOT SHUT DOWN ANY FACILITIES. IT IS NOT PREVENT AFFILIATIONS FROM HAPPENING. IT SIMPLY PROVIDES THE UC PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER. ON NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE CARE THAT THEY THINK. IS APPROPRIATE AND NOT LITERALLY HAVE YOUR TO I MEAN IF YOU IMAGINE GOING TO YOUR DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR SAYS. I THINK THAT THIS PROCEDURE WOULD BENEFIT YOU. I THINK THAT THIS TREE WILL BENEFIT YOU. BUT BECAUSE THESE SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS. BECAUSE OF THESE POLICY BASED RESEARCH AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO PROVIDE IT TO YOU YOU HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT THEY TRY TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET IT DONE. DOT DOT SINCE IT'S IS NOT APPROPRIATE AND THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT. TELLING HOSPITALS WHAT WHAT SERVICES THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE OR NOT PROVIDE IT'S SAYING THAT IF THE UC. IT'S GOING TO AFFILIATE. AND BASICALLY PARTNER WITH ANOTHER HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO YOU SEE PATIENTS. THEN THOSE UC PHYSICIANS OR PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN MEDICAL JUDGMENT ABOUT WHAT HEALTH CARE IS APPROPRIATE AND NOT HAVE THEIR-THOSE DECISIONS MADE FOR THEM. pNOTHING TO DO WITH CLINICAL JUDGMENT. I REALIZE THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN THESE HOSPITALS BUT YOUR BILL DOES SAY THAT- YOU SEE. THAT PHYSICIANS WOULD BEGIN CONTRACT WITH YOU SEE YOU CEASE TO HAVE YOU SEE. A HOSPITAL FACILITIES SO NOT HAVING THOSE FACILITIES ARE NOT HAVING THOSE PHYSICIANS AVAILABLE FOR AND- RESIDENCIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN MOST OF THESE- MOST OF THE SERVICES IN THESE FAITH BASED HOSPITALS ARE LED AND RAN BY UC PHYSICIANS. WOULD EVENTUALLY I MEAN I REALIZE THAT YOUR BILL DOESN'T SAY DIRECTLY SHUT THEM DOWN BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PHYSICIANS ON STAFF TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS SO THE PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE ACCESS TO CARE- AND THEN IT DOES BASICALLY SHUT DOWN OUR HOSPITALS ARE SIT DOWN SERVICE AT LEAST WE WOULDN'T BUILD PROVIDE SERVICES. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE THE MEDICAL PROVIDERS WOULDN'T BE THERE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE KERRIER HOLDING OVER THEIR HEAD IS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET YOU SEE QUALIFIED MEDICAL PROVIDERS IF YOU CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A PLACE OF CONSCIOUS. IN MY COLLEAGUES THAT I SURE THIS KERN COUNTY WITH SENATOR HER TADO HAS AUTHORIZED A NUMBER OFBILLS THAT ACCESS TO SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE FOR CARE SO THAT PEOPLE GET QUALITY MEDICAL CARE. IN YOUR BILL LIMITS THAT ACCESS TREMENDOUSLY WHETHER IT DOES DIRECTLY OR NDIRECTLY. THESE AND FAITH BASED FACILITIES ARE THE SPACE SPACE HOSPITALS WHO TREAT EVERYBODY EQUITABLY AND THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT QUALITY OF CARE TO THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY ALLOW- NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR CANCER TREATMENTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS AND THINGS LIKE THAT LIKE A PREFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF MY COMMENTS. IT'STHE ONLY ONE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT DOES IT SO IT DOES LIMIT SERVICE IN CARE AND- A MEDICAL SERVICES TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH AGAIN ARE A LARGE POPULATION OF BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THE LARGEST. A FARMWORKER POPULATION IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THE FIVE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE WORLD. THEIR HEALTHCARE WOULD BE LIMITED WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADVENTIST HEALTH DIGNITY HEALTH YOU LOOK AT ALL THESE HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT ARE EXPANDING. AND NOT HAVING ACCESS. TO THOSE POSITIONS FROM THE UC'S CENTER TO DO THEIR INTERN. OR STEAMY THE- RESIDENCIES AT A HOUSE THAT LEE. TO OF THE- MOST GREW. TECH THAT WE HAVE. OUR CONSIDER. WOULD BE- ON. DECK AFFECTED INDIAN CENTRAL VALLEY- I DO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT- HOSPITALS THAT DON'T PROVIDE CANCER TREATMENT OR SOME HOSPITALS DON'T PROVIDE EXTENSIVE TRAUMA CARE THEY DON'T HAVE A- OF VALLEY FEVER CENTER AND NONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW THAT'S IT IN THE HOSPITALS AROUND THE STATE NONE OF THEM PROVIDE THAT KIND OF EQUITABLE CARE. TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THAT CARE IT'S ALL PROVIDED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AND I KNOW THERE'S CANCER TREATMENT FACILITIES IN TRAUMA FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE I'M NOT SAYING THAT- I JUST THINK THAT. YOUR FRANKLY I'M JUST YOUR BILL IS SHORT SIGHTED WITH THE FACT THAT YOU WANT TO FORCE THESE FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE ABORTION AND STERILIZATION SERVICES. TO EVERYBODY WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR WHEN THERE'S A PLANNED PARENTHOOD ON EVERY CORNER. AND WHICH BASICALLY IS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE WHO WANTS IT AND IT'S TOTALLY TAXPAYER FUNDED- THIS LEGISLATURE HAS MADE- THAT COMPLETELY. EVIDENT THAT THAT'S- YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- IT'S- YOU'RE JUST GONNA LIMIT ACCESS AND THIS IS AN ATTACK ON THIS FAITH COMMUNITY THAT DOESN'T PROVIDE THE SERVICES- OF CONSCIENCE THAT YOU THINK AND YOU WANT TO IMPOSE WHAT YOU THINK AND WHAT YOU WANT- ON THESE HOSPITALS WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT IN ORDER TO FURTHER THAT AGENDA YOU WERE GOING TO LIMIT EXTENSIVELY LIMIT. HEALTH CARE SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NOW YOU MAY HAVE THESE GREAT PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO IN SAN FRANCISCO. BUT THERE ARE- A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE TRANSPORTATION. TO DRIVE UP TO SAN FRANCISCO THEY CAN'T TAKE THE TIME OFF WORK TO DRIVE TO UCLA- IN OTHER LOCATIONS TO GET THIS TREATMENT. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS AGAINST THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE GROW ALL YOUR FOOD. AND WE PRODUCE ABOUT 70% YOUR ENERGY. AND FOR YOU TO PASS A PIECEOF LEGISLATION AGAIN THAT AFFECTS THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN SUCH A DRAMATIC WAY TO LIMIT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR OUR RESIDENTS IS. BEYOND ME I WISH SHE WOULD FOCUS ON SAN FRANCISCO BILLS THAT AFFECT AND PROMOTE SAN FRANCISCO INSTEAD OF ATTACKING THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ITS RESIDENTS. THANK YOU CENTER GROVE- CENTER GONZALEZ. YES THANK YOU AND I WANT TO ACTUALLY THINK- THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT IS IN MY OPINION ABOUT HEALTH EQUITY AND HAVING YOU KNOW I'M FROM LOS ANGELES LONG BEACH WHERE WE HAVE A VERY LARGE LGBTQ COMMUNITY VERY VERY SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES IN THE NEEDS AND- MANY OF OUR TRANSGENDER CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS AND THAT'S THE- GIST OF THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO CO AUTHOR. I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THERE ARE- I HAVE DIGNITY HEALTH IN MY BACKYARD AND I HAVE A GREAT DIGNITY HEALTH THE LONG BEACH BECAUSE THEY OFFER SOME OF THE BEST LGBT Q. KERR- AND HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN FOUNDATION SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF INSTITUTIONS ALTHOUGH IT IS ST MARY'S. DIGNITY HEALTH- STILL PROVIDES INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO THESE COMMUNITIES AND- I CAN SEE CONTINUING TO PARTNER IN THIS SENSE AND NOT LIMITING ACCESS TO FOLKS THAT NEED IT THE MOST SO WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND ALL- BE HAPPY TO. MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR OKAY THANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SERRA GONZALEZ TO PREPARE TIME- ACTUALLY TADO AND THEN FOLLOW THE CENTER RAS TO AT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OPEN TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT'S MY UNDER THAT THE FOR HE IS A P. UNIVERSITY. CALIFORNIA QUITE FRANKLY IN THE CENTER VALLEY. WE HAVE ONE YOU SEE. WE HAVE WHEN YOU SEE CAMPUS AND IT DOESN'T HAVE A MEDICAL SCHOOL ONE DAY AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE. HOLDEN- BUT- INSTITUTES AT THE YOU KNOW ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROVIDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM AN OPPORTUNITY- TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE BY HOLD THE- OUR OUR INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE AND- AND I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND I'M AND I THINK THERE'S LKE I SAID. THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE BY HOLDING INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE HAPPY TO SUPPORTER AND WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU. CETERA THANK YOU MISTER YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. FRANKLY AN ISSUE. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND PERHAPS THE EFFORTS TO OR THE FACT THAT IT'S BEING ADDRESSED NOW. PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE. BY QUITE SOME TIME AGO. WE DO HAVE A RATHER UNIQUE SITUATION WITH THE MEDICAL SCHOOL. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE AND I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY. THANK THE AUTHOR THE AUTHORS STAFF. THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF WITH- WORKING THROUGH THOSE RATHER UNIQUE ISSUES AND- COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT- WHILE YOU SEE ARE IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE WILL MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL. GIVES YOU SEE ARE IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE A LITTLE EXTRA TIME. SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A HOSPITAL. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MEDICAL SCHOOL GIVES YOU SEE ARE IN THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. A JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO COMPLY AND DO SO. SO THANK YOU BOTH I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THE OTHER ANY OTHER- CENTER AT. BUT I THINK YOU AND THANK YOU TO OTHER- BUT I ALSO REALIZE IN OF THIS IS AND- AND WE BE SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT AS OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE STATE I'LL HAVE A ARE. FOR COUNTY HOSPITAL HAS AFFILIATE WITH THE WITH USE- AND I KNOW A COMMERCE GO ON RIGHT NOW A WITH JOSEPH'S IN IN JOAQUIN. AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE- ACCOUNTHAAS- AND SO. WE WILL EVERYONE HAVE ALL THE CARE THEY- BUT WE ALSO WANT ME VERY AREFUL THAT WE'RE CUT OFF. TO BE HEALTH CARE. IN DESIST THAT PROVIDE- SO MUCH SO MANY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK TO THE AUTHOR- HAVING THE COURAGE TO BRING THIS FORWARD I YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUTLER THERE'S A LOT OF PHAM. CONCERN ONE READY EITHER I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE THE OTHER TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO WORK THESE ISSUES OUT AND WITH THAT AGAIN I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL MOVE IT IF WHEN APPROPRIATE THINKS I SHOULD BELIEVE IT'S VERY BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GONZALEZ BUT THANK YOU- BUT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS. OKAY. NINE- SO SIR WIENER AYE IT MONTH FOR OF ALL THANK FOR WHAT. WITH ME IN MY COMMITTEE- I AND YEAH THAT. THIS BILL IS CHAO. FOR YES CERTAINLY WE CONCERNED ABOUT- PEOPLE BE ABLE TO. CARE BUT THAT CUTS BOTH WAYS WITH THE BILL RIGHT NOW- BY OF THE MAJOR. IS NO YOU DON'T WANT YOU SEE SAYS. AND OTHER HEALTH FOR. GOING TO AND- SQUARE TO CANNOT BASIC PRACTICE THE OF. THAT THIS IS EXPECTED OF THEM THAT THEY CANNOT- PRACTICE. FIELD PROVIDE ALL THE OPTIONS TO- THE PATIENCE OF THE PATIENT SHOULD KNOW ABOUT- I APPRECIATE THAT UC'S OF THESE TAKEN SOME INITIAL STEPS- WITH- ESSENTIALLY. BEING SURE THAT OUR CONTRACTORS AND A GAG CLAUSE BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I THINK THAT- GOOD. HI ACTUALLY HOPE- I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE TO YEARS AWAY WITH THE OUT I GOT CALL IN YOU SEE. TO HAVE A- WITH YOU AND YOURS THIS OF THIS BILL IN TERMS OF WHAT COMMITMENTS THEY'RE WILLING TO MAKE. IN CONTRACTS MOVING FORWARD. AND AS WELL AS EXISTING CONTRACTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF NOT LIMITING. YOU SEE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FOR FROM FAILED TO PROVIDE THE CARE THAT THEY BELIEVE IS BEST FOR THE PATIENTS. BECAUSE THAT SENDS A WRONG SIGNAL CERTAINLY I'M YOU KNOW I'M A FORMER UC PHYSICIAN I- SEE. RESIDENCY PROGRAM- WE NEED TO TEACH OUR WE TEACH OUR RESIDENTS ABOUT ADVOCACY AND IMPORTANCE OF. ADVOCATING FOR PATIENTS. AND O WHAT KIND OF LESSON DO WE SEND WHEN WE TELL THEM WELL YOU CAN NAVIGATE TO YOUR PATIENTS BUT WHEN AN INSTITUTION DENIES WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PATIENTS. YOU ARE BASICALLY TOLD TO. TURN AWAY AND NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE. AND SAME WITH STAFF MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE MODEL THAT. SO WHO'S BEEN CERTAINLY THIS IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. YOU SEE TO. DEMONSTRATE THROUGH ITS CONTRACTS THE VALUES THAT OF THE INSTITUTION THAT IT DOESN'T RESTRICTS MEMBERS OF ITS OWN FACULTY AND ITS OWN TRAINEES FROM PROVIDING THE MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AND IF THAT CONTRACT IS UNACCEPTABLE TO THAT HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL THAT'S AFFILIATING AND IT'S A HOSPITAL THAT'S NINE CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS. WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OF THAT REFUSES ACCEPT THIS KIND OF PROVISIONS. SO WITH THAT I URGE YOU TO TIRED YOU BY AUTHORS OTHER PEOPLE TO WORK WITH YOU ET'S TRY TO COME TO A RESOLUTION- BUT WE NEED TO ALSO THINK ABOUT THE ROLE EACH OF THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS PLAY. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO CARE IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE. AND I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE. SO WITH THAT. SENATOR WE KNOW WHICH IS LIKE CLOSE. I THANK YOU FOR THOSE REALLY- ELOQUENT AND ON POINT COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I AGREE WITH YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE PERSONALLY INVESTED TIME AND AS I. INDICATED TO YOU- I AM- I AM- YOU KNOW. WILL BE THRILLED FOR YOU TO CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED IF YOU HAVE TIME. BECAUSE WE COULD REALLY USE YOUR YOUR- JUST EXPERIENCE ON THIS ISSUE WORKING WITH US GOING FORWARD- I WANT TO BE REALLY REALLY CLEAR ABOUT. SOMETHING WE DID NOT THIS IS NOT A THE BILL WHERE WE WOKE UP ONE MORNING. AND SAID WE'RE MAD ABOUT THESE AFFILIATIONS. OF LET'S DO A BILL. RIGHT THE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. FOR YEARS. AND WE DO NOT THINK WE WOULD EVER HAVE TO DO A BILL WE DON'T WANT TO DO A BILL. FOR YEARS THE UC COMMUNITY. WAS WORKING PHYSICIAN'S AND STUDENTS THAT WERE REALLY IT'S VERY LOT OF STUFF SETTING TROUBLING TO THEM THE UC AGREES TO THESE RESTRICTIONS. THERE WAS A BAY WERE ADVOCATING WITH AND GAUGING AND WORKGROUPS AND DOING ALL SORTS OF WORK FOR YEARS TO TRY TO GET YOU SEE.

I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN BUT THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS CANCERS GIFTS CAN YOU SEE JUST KEEPS KICKING IT DOWN THE ROAD AND NOT WANTING TO DEAL WITH THAT AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE DON'T STEP IN AND SET STANDARDS. IS THAT FIVE TEN YEARS FROM NOW. IT'S GOING TO BE A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF YOU SEE PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS WHO ARE RESTRICTED BY THESE NON SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS ON CARE. IT IS TIME FOR US TO STEP IN AND SET STANDARDS. FONG I WON SAID IN A NOTE CENTER GROVE'S AFTER SHE MADE THOSE RATHER INFLAMMATORY REMARKS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO WITH A LOT OF INACCURACIES- AS LEFT I HOPE SHE WILL.

WE BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE WILL ALSO HELP ADDRESS THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY HEALTH ACCESS AS WELL AND I THINK THEY'RE GONNA SAY SOMETHING TODAY TO THAT EFFECT SB TWO TOO FAR FOR TWO TO FIVE WILL PROTECT W. TO FREELANCE COMMON LAW TV COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES FROM LOSING THEIR EXISTING. HEALTH CARE A NO COST INSURANCE RESULTING FROM A RECENT CHANGE IN THE LAW THE EMPLOYERS PAY THE INSURANCE WHICH IS RARE AND VOLUNTARY AND REALLY MAKES THIS PLAN. WORK FOR THIS GROUP OF- CALIFORNIANS FREELANCE EMPLOYMENT IS THE BACKBONE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY'S EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES BECAUSE FREELANCE FILMING CREWS ARE HIRED ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS MAY HAVE DOZENS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTION COMPANY EMPLOYERS OVER COURSE OF THE YEAR THEY HAVE NO MEANS TO QUALIFY FOR REGULAR EMPLOYER BENEFIT PLANS TO FILL THIS VOID THE PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN. A FULLY INSURED EMPLOYER SPONSORED HEALTH PLAN WHICH FORM PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY HEALTH BENEFITS AT NO COST TO THE NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA W. TO COMMON LAW EMPLOYEES OF THE TELEVISION COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY HOWEVER DUE TO A RECENT ENACTED LEGISLATION THESE FREELANCERS ARE NOW IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING THIS INSURANCE. SB TWO FIVE FIVE WILL PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING BY ALLOWING THE P. H. B. B. N. ONLY PHP BE TO CONTINUE OFFERING THEIR INSURANCE BUT ONLY IF IT MEETS THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT THE NEW LAW WAS INTENDED TO POLLS SB TWO FIVE FIVE DOES NOT PASS THESE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS WILL LOSE THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE. WHICH IS NOW VOLUNTARILY PAID BY THEIR EMPLOYERS AND WILL BE FORCED TO REPLACE IT WITH A SELF PAID INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE AT A MUCH HIGHER COST THAN THE EMPLOYERS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE A IN. LARGE GROUP. AND I RESPECTFULLY. THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL WHEN APPROPRIATE AND ON THE PHONE I HAVE SHOWN COOLEY. WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFIT PROGRAM. AND BONNIE GOLDFARB THE OWNER OF A BOUTIQUE PRODUCTION COMPANY. AND A COMMISSIONER ON THE CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION. IMPORTANT TO MENTION AS WELL BEFORE I GO TO MY TWO WITNESSES. THAT THE CREW HAVE THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS PAID FOR BY THEIR GUILDS. THIS IS A SMALL SUBSET OF THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY. THAT WOULD BE DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE IF WE WERE NOT TO PASS THIS BILL WHERE THE CREW WOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE SO THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE AS WELL. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I VOTING PLEASE GO TO MY TWO WITNESSES. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON TO THE LINE TO LEAD WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEAN COOLEY FROM PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN AND BONNIE GOLDFARB- WITH THE- COMMISSIONER ON CALIFORNIA FILM COMMISSION.

YOU CAN BRING THE MINE AND WE'LL START WITH JOHN COOLEY. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF SB TWO FIFTY FIVE MY NAME IS SEAN COOLEY AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PRODUCERS HEALTH BENEFITS PLAN THE BILL'S SPONSOR. BOB WHAT'S YOUR CHOICE BY OUR ACRONYM PHD P. HE WAS STARTED AS A WAY FOR EMPLOYERS AND THE TV COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE HELP AND ATTEMPTS TO THEIR FULL TIME W. TWO FREELANCE EMPLOYEES OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE. FOR EMPLOYER HEALTH PLAN. IT'S TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE PROVIDED FOR HIGH. HEALTH COVERAGE AND CURRENTLY IN SHORT TWELVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA FREELANCERS. WHILE PARTICIPATION IN THE PRELIMS PROGRAM IS MANDATORY OF ALL OF OUR TWO HUNDRED PLUS PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS. OPTIONAL NON FREELANCE STAFF COVERAGE IS AVAILABLE OF WHICH PARTICIPATE. 70% OF OUR TOTAL COVERED EMPLOYEES ARE FREELANCERS. PGP INVALUABLE NOT ONLY TO THE LIVES OF THESE FREELANCERS BUT I BELIEVE TO THE STATE AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN A WEEK OF THE GOVERNOR'S STATE HOME ORDERS THE PLAN IMPLEMENTED A SERIES OF COPING NINETEEN RELIEF MEASURES. EXTENDING COVERAGE PERIOD FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN MONTHS DURATIONS TO ENSURE NO ONE LOST COVERAGE DUE TO THE INDUSTRY SHUTDOWN CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC. WE WAIVED ALL OUT OF POCKET FEES WHICH IS ALREADY HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED DEPENDENCIES. AND ISSUED A 20% DISCOUNT ON ALL COBRA PREMIUMS FROM APRIL FIRST THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY. IF ANYONE LOST COVERAGE IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE RELIEF MEASURES WE SUBSIDIZE THEIR COCA PREMIUMS BY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. BECAUSE IT HEALTHY RESERVES INCLUDING GOVERNANCE THE PLAN WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A LIFESAVING FINANCIAL SAFETY NET TO ALL OF OUR COVERED PROFESSORS AT NO COST TO THE STATE. THIS EXAMPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY TAKING CARE OF ITSELF IS TYPICAL OF THE PHD P. STORY. THERE'S NO SCENARIO IN WHICH THE WORKER OR FOR THAT MATTER THE EMPLOYER OR THE ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. BENEFITTED THESE FREELANCERS ARE FORCED TO FAXING FORCED TO THE OPEN MARKET TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR. INSURANCE THE EMPLOYER IS WILLING TO PROVIDE AND HAS PROVIDED FOR FREE.

THE MARKETER DESTABILIZE THE MARKET I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PLAN WAS IN EXISTENCE BEFORE THE ACA AND FORTUNATELY I THINK THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBSEQUENT TO THE EIGHTY OR MORE DESIGNS TO. SENSUALLY TAKE HEALTHIER POPULATIONS MOVE OUT OF THE MARKET WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY. BE A PROBLEMATIC AND ACTUALLY RAISE HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER OR WHO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASE AND SO FORTH SO WE WANT TO BE SURE WE DIDN'T. CAUSE THAT TO HAPPEN SO AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH- THE COMMITTEE STAFF TAKING THE AMENDMENTS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS BOTH OF THE PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THIS PLAN BUT ALSO FOR THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE MARKET. AS WELL THE SMALL GROUP MARKET THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET AND SO FORTH.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS SB FIVE SIX TWO WILL ELIMINATE SIGNIFICAN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IMPOSED BY HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE PREVENTING FAMILIES FROM ACCESSING A BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH AUTISM OVERSEE BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT EARLY CAN SHOW REMARKABLE PROGRESS. THE BILL ALSO CODIFIES REQUIREMENTS FOR QUALIFIED AUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONAL AND PARA PROFESSIONAL TO ENSURE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE CITY SIX TELL US THAT ONE IN FIFTY NINE CHILDREN BORN TODAY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY TO HELPING THESE CHILDREN LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL. AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS CRITICAL NOT ALL CHILDREN WITH AUTISM ARE THE SAME THEY RESPOND TO TREATMENT DIFFERENTLY CHILDREN NEED TREATMENT TAILORED TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN OR PSYCHOLOGIST WHO KNOWS THEM BEST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL TREATMENT THAT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR THAT CHILD. EIGHT YEARS AGO SB NINE FORTY SIX PASSED THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IT HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS BUT OTHERS HAVE BEEN PREVENTED FROM RECEIVING ITS BENEFITS BECAUSE OF DRAFTING ERRORS IN ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS NOT EVERY CHILD IN THE RECEIVING. COVERAGE FOR THE TREATMENT THAT THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER PRESCRIBES THEM THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING DENIED COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED EVIDENCE BASED CARE THIS COVERAGE IS THIS IS COVERAGE THEY OR THEIR EMPLOYERS HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR ME SAY THAT AGAIN. THIS COVERAGE HAS BEEN PAID FOR ITS JUST BEING DENIED. FOR THESE PATIENTS BUT TO INTO MEDICATIONS THE PARENTS OR THE STATE ARE LEFT TO COVER THE COSTS OUT OF POCKET FOR THIS CRITICAL CARE ADDITIONALLY FOR MANY CHILDREN THERE IS A. SIX TO TWELVE MONTH WAITING LIST FOR THE ONE FRIEDMAN THAT HEALTHY. WILL COVER TREATMENT DELAYED HIS TREATMENT DENIED IN A DEVELOPING MIND. BY EXPANDING THE TYPES OF QUALIFIED ALREADY STIRRED CERTIFIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE THIS BILL WILL BOTH ADDRESS THIS CRITICAL SHORTAGES AND ALLOW FOR CHILDREN TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THEIR PHYSICIAN HAS PRESCRIBED. THE BILL WILL ALSO ADDRESS ROADBLOCKS THE COVERAGE FOR PATIENTS WHO FOR REASONS OF WORK OR FAMILY PRESSURE CANNOT FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THEIR CHILD'S THERAPY SESSIONS OR WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE RECEIVED SERVICES AT OUR AFTER SCHOOL DAY CARE SETTING. THE SISTER WEEKS THE SITUATION SHOULD NOT BE PRECLUDED FOR COVERAGE. FOR MEDICALLY MCGANN MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENTS AND WITH SB FIVE SIXTY TWO THEY WON'T. I HAVE WITH ME HERE TO TAKE TO TESTIFY JIM LANDRY FROM THE D. I. R. COALITION OF CALIFORNIAN ALISON FAINT A PARENT OF A CHILD WITH AUTISM. AND WHEN APPROPRIATE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE OF. THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO. MODERATOR WE ARE MOVING ON TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON TO THE LINE ARE TO LEAD WITNESSES TO TESTIFY JIM LANTRY FROM THE A. R.

FLOOR TIME COALITION A CALIFORNIA COALITION PARENTS WHO PROVIDERS SEEKING CHOICE TREATMENT. ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH AUTISM DESERVE THE BEST DOCTOR OR PSYCHOLOGIST PRESCRIBED MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THEM RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE TREATMENT EARLY RESPOND BETTER AND RESEARCH SHOWS THE TREATMENT TAILORED TO THE NEEDS-OF THE CHILD IS IMPORTANT AND RESULTS IN THE CHILD ATTAINING HIS OR HER POTENTIAL. NO TWO CHILDREN ARE ALIKE OF THE SENATOR SAID WHAT WORKS FOR ONE CHILD MAY ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL FOR ANOTHER SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT A CHILD RECEIVE THE TREATMENT PRESCRIBED BY THE CLINICIAN WHO KNOWS THE BEST. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE MENTAL HEALTH THIRTY ONE NINETY NINE IT ANTICIPATED THAT AUTISM WOULD BE TREATED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PHYSICAL AILMENTS THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE TWENTY ELEVEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB NINE FORTY SIX WHICH MANDATED THAT ALL PRESCRIBE MEDICALLY NECESSARY EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENTS BE COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE AND AGAIN UNFORTUNATELY THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WHAT DID HAPPEN IS THAT HEALTH INSURANCE WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS COVERED ONLY ONE FORM. OF BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT ABA. AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A B. X. THAT. SOME CHILL NEED. ELSE AS A RESULT PARENTS CHILDREN WITH AUTISM PRESCRIBE A DIFFERENT FORM OF TREATMENT FOR FACED WITH THREE OPTIONS. FIRST WAS TO PAY FOR THE PRESCRIBED TREATMENT OUT OF POCKET EVEN THOUGH THEY OR THEIR EMPLOYERS AND ALREADY PAID FOR THE COVERAGE. FOR MOST PARENTS PARTICULARLY SINGLE PARENTS OF LOW INCOME PARENTS THIS OPTION WAS UNAFFORDABLE. SECOND WAS DANCE REGIONAL CENTERS TO PAY FOR THE TREATMENT IN SOME CASES OCCURRED CONTRARY TO LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF MINE FORTY SENATE BILL NINE FORTY SIX. IN THE THIRD OPTION WAS SIMPLY TO ACCEPT THE ONE FORM OF THERAPY THAT WHAT'S COVERED EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE IDEAL OR EVEN BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CHILD. IT ALSO RESULTED IN A LONGER TERM CARE COST EMAILS FROM HEALTH INSURANCE CARRIER MORE MONEY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY COSTING THE CHILD TIME CAN NEVER BE RECOVERED. THIS BILL RECTIFY THAT WOULD FINALLY ACHIEVE THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF MENTAL HEALTH PARITY BILL SB NINE FORTY SIX. ONE POINT OUT THE QUALIFIEDAUTISM SERVICE PROFESSIONALS THIS BILL ADDS ARE ALREADY CLASSIFIED AS MENTAL HEALTH. PROVIDERS. THAT WERE INCLUDED IN SENATE BILL. SO BILL EIGHT FIVE.

COME AGAIN TWO MINUTES APIECE MAXIMO FOUR MINUTES FOR BOTH WITNESSES TOGETHER. SO PLEASE BEGIN WITH MELISSA CORTEZ. GOOD AFTERNOON- MELISSA CORTEZ THE GOVERNMENTAL ADVOCATES REPRESENTING THE CENTER FOR AUTISM AND RELATED DISORDERS. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE CHANGE IN THE DEFINITION OF BEHAVIOR HEALTH TREATMENT THAT IS IN THIS BILL. CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES COVERAGE FOR ALL EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENTS I WANT TO GO BACK AND EXPLAIN HOW THE ORIGINAL MANDATE WAS DRAFTED WHY IT WAS DONE THAT WAY. AT THAT TIME DAMAGE THE NGO I HAD SIGNED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THEM THE LARGE HEALTH PLANS SH IN THOSE AGREEMENTS THE PLANT HAD AGREED TO SPECIFICALLY COVER APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS. AND THIS IS ONLY AFTER VERY LARGE VOLUMES OF DENIAL ROUTINELY OVERTURNED BY INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW. BUT THOSE SETTLEMENT DIDN'T COVER ALL PLANTS AND THEY REQUIRED TREATMENT BY LICENSED PROVIDERS. AND CALIFORNIA ABA PROVIDERS ARE CERTIFIED BUT NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE THE LEGISLATION WAS NEEDED TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THAT LAW WAS BEING DEBATED THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHERE THEY'RE ASKING THAT FLOOR SIGN THE INCLUDED. THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT NOR WAS THERE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AT THAT TIME TO SUPPORT MANDATED COVERAGE. BUT THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT TO CLOSE THE DOOR TO EMERGING MODALITIES AND THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WAS DRAFTED TO INCLUDE ALL OTHER EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THIS MEANS. THAT IF AND WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH RESEARCH TO FIND THE AN INTERVENTION IT'S EVIDENCE BASED. IT IS COVERAGE THAT WOULD NOT A DRAFTING ERROR. BUT YOU'RE PER REPORT ON THIS BILL STATE THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF RELATIONSHIP BASED INTERVENTIONS. AND THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT MORE TIME SHEPHERD SAID THE BASED ON UNCONTROLLED STUDIES WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES SO WE'RE HERE TALKING ABOUT MANDATED COVERAGE. FOR UNPROVEN INTERVENTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS IF KIDS ARE MOVED INTO LESS EFFECTIVE OR INEFFECTIVE TREATMENTS. SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT ADA VERSUS FOR TIME THIS IS ABOUT PRESERVING A STANDARD OF CARE THAT IS BASED ON SCIENCE AND RESEARCH FOR THAT REASON WE ORIGINAL ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW SPRING ON NYCLU RECESS. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS. THANK YOU MISTER SHE AND MEMBERS WITH WITH THE CAL. SO HOW PLANS. I'M IN A- TO FIVE TWO WHICH EXPANDS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COVERAGE IN A MANNER. THAT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EXISTING MEDICAL LITERATURE AND BEST PRACTICES. HEALTH PLANS APPLY EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES TO COVERAGE DECISIONS TO HELP INSURE ENROLLEES RECEIVE THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT SETTING. THE UNDERLYING FOUNDATION OF THIS APPROACH IS THE SYSTEMIC OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EVIDENCE BASED METHODS TO TREATMENT. FOR AUTISM SERVICES APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS OR ABA- IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EVIDENCE BASED-TREATMENT BOB SO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH SB FIVE SIXTY TWO AND ITS PREDECESSOR BILLS- THAT HAVE BEEN VETOED IN THE PAST. I'M IS THAT IT ESTABLISHES A SUB STANDARD SET OF REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVIDERS BY ALLOWING NON EEA TRAIN PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE DIRECT AUTISM CARE. THIS WILL DECREASE THE QUALITY OF AUTISM CARE BECAUSE WILL RESULT IN A DIMINISHMENT OF EVIDENCE BASED CARE PROVIDED TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM DURING CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL ALSO ELIMINATES THE ABILITY THE HEALTH PLANS TO REVIEW THE TREATMENT PLAN AND EVALUATE THE LOCATION OF TREATMENTS. OR TO ASSESS WHETHER PARENTAL PARTICIPATION- IS- BEING PROVIDED- YOU. COULD YOU WITH THE SERVICE AND WE BELIEVE THAT. BOTH OF THESE THINGS GO AGAINST THE CLINICAL BEST PRACTICES. AND BECAUSE BEST PRACTICE RESEARCH HAS PROVEN THAT CHILDREN HAVE A BETTER RESPONSE ST TO TREATMENT. THAT MASTER SKILLS BETTER IT BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED BY PARENTS OR GUARDIANS. SO FOR THE REASONS STATED. AB IS IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE SIXTY TWO THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES-IN OPPOSITION AGAIN NAME POSITION.

AMONG PRIVATE INSURERS- INTO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT- WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITY AND THE LONG TERM IMPORTANCE OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURAL REFORM AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD PRECIADO BUT THE-COMMITTEES DILIGENCE AND YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE MISTER CHAIR- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WORKING OUT FOR INSTANCE A CONTRACTING MODEL OR REIMBURSEMENT MODEL ACROSS MULTIPLE PLANS. IN MULTIPLE TYPES OF DISTRICTS RURAL URBAN- YOU KNOW LARGER DISTRICTS- OR SMALLER DISTRICTS THERE'S A THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIABILITY IN EXPERIMENTATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR HOW TO BETTER MERGE BOTH OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM EDUCATION SYSTEM SO WE MAXIMIZE- THIS SERVICE TO STUDENTS WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF TRAUMA OUT THERE AND WE KNOW THAT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. REQUIRES CONSISTENCY THAT RELATIONSHIP. WITH STUDENTS IN THE TRUST THAT'S BUILT THERE YOU CAN'T DO MENTAL HEALTH AND PROPER TRAUMA CARE WITH STUDENTS IF YOU'RE OPERATING IN FITS AND STARTS SO- YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY I KNOW THERE'S BUDGET ACTION UNDERWAY THIS YEAR ON ON THE PUBLIC INSURANCE SIDE OF IT ON THE MEDICARE OUTSIDE. AND I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THOSE ISSUES SO WE'RE HOPING THAT THROUGH SOME OF THAT WORK IN FLESHING OUT THOSE OPPORTUNISM THE PUBLIC SIDE BUT ALSO BY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN GET DH CS I'M MORE FOCUSED ON REALLY MAKING- FINDING MODELS THAT WORK.

THANK YOU TO SHARE MEMBERS- THIS BILL DEALS WITH THE NURSING HOME SECTOR AND FRANKLY A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND YOU THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE BOTH THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE THAT WE BRING TO THE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE OFTEN TIMES ALONE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE IN THEIR MOST VULNERABLE. STATE AND OFTEN SUFFERING INDIGNITIES AND EXACERBATIONS OF HEALTH IMPACTS- FROM THERE SETTING- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS WORK GOING ON IN THE CARE ECONOMY AND OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS IN NURSING HOMES ACROSS pPUTTING THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THEIR HEART ON THE LINE EVERY DAY TO HELP PEOPLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT PUBLIC DOLLARS GO TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT ON THE FRONT LINES THE PEOPLE WORKING THE PEOPLE RECEIVING THE CARE SO THIS BILL IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO BUILD MORE TRANSPARENCY ON THE BACK END OF THIS SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE ADEQUATE DATA ON EXACTLY HOW THE CORPORATE STRUCTURES ON THE PRIVATE SIDE OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY INDUSTRY ARE OPERATING WE KNOW THERE'S SOME COMPLEX BUSINESS MODELS OUT THERE THIS IS A VERY LARGE INDUSTRY AT THE BALL FRANKLY OF THIS SKILLED NURSING FACILITY INDUSTRY. IS RUN ON THE PRIVATE SIDE IN THREE QUARTERS A CARE IN THE STATE IS DELIVERED THAT WAY AND THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT AN ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS THE LOCAL LEVEL- OF THIS OF THE FOR PROFIT SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY I WE KNOW THERE'S VERY GOOD WORK GOING ON OUT THERE BUT WE KNOW THERE'S ALSO- THE RISK. IN SOME OF THESE CORPORATE STRUCTURES ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO RELATED PARTIES- WHERE MULTIPLE CORPORATE ENTITIES- MAY HAVE A HOLDING OPERATE A SUPPLY COMPANY ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE CARE ALWAYS RELATED INJURIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE MADE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE THE CARE IS REALLY BEING DELIVERED. TO WHERE IT NEEDS AND IS NEEDED BOTH STE- THIS BILL IS- DEBT HE REALLY DOESN'T. CHANGE FUNDAMENTA THE STRUCTURE THE INDUSTRY AND IT DOESN'T ATTEMPT TO DO SO IT'S MUCH MORE SO ABOUT BRINGING THAT DATA TO LIGHT AND HOPEFULLY WITH A BIT OF SUNLIGHT- WE CAN HAVE MORE TRUST IN THE PLACES THAT WE SEND OUR PARENTS AND OUR LOVE ONES TOO AND THAT. SOMEDAY WE OURSELVES WILL WILL END UP THERE SO I CONSIDER THIS A DOWN PAYMENT- ON- A MORE TRANSPARENT MORE CARING AT A MORE HUMANE A PATH TO AGING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THE DETAILS ARE LOOKS LOOK FORWARD TO THAT WORK BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK. WE CERTAINLY ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS- AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU ALL AS AS THIS LESSON LEGISLATION MOVES TOWARD ALSO WANT TO THANK THOUGH THEY THEY HEALTH FACILITIES A GOOD FAITH EFFORTS IN WORKING WITH THIS YEAR THEY THEY REALLY COME TO THE TABLE EARLY AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT WEEK WE CAN TALK THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAILS IN COMMUTER GOING FORWARD BUT I.

AS THE OTHER DIMINISH THURSDAY WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. IN NURSING HOME. ONE THING THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THE CALL AT NINETEEN HUNDRED HAD TO CLOSE. LOSS ARSENAL BRACKETS THAT. IN AN EQUITABLE PROPER GERMAN INDUSTRY AFFECTED PARTICIPANTS SAFETY AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF WORKERS AND THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR RESIDENTS. CROWDED UNDERSTAFFED AND LACK OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT IN THE COLD IN THE SYSTEM ARE AT THE ROOT OF THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY WHICH IS WHY WOULD BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT REFORMS. THAT WILL MOVE OUR STATE NURSING HOME SYSTEM TOWARDS ONE THAT IS BUILT ON QUALITY CHAIR CORPORATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. SB SIX FIFTY AND TO BRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO BILLIONAIRE NURSING HOME OWNERS WHO HAVE GROWN RICHER BY PROPERTY FROM A NETWORK OF. INTER RELATED CORPORATIONS THAT EXTRACT PROFIT AT EVERY LEVEL RATHER THAN INVESTING IN PATIENT CARE. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN KAISER HEALTH NEWS ANALYSTS FOUND THAT- YES WHICH CONTRACT WITH RELATED PARTY. YOU WERE NURSES AND AIDES FOR PATIENTS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF PATIENT INJURED AND INJURIES AND I'M BASED PRACTICES AND THEIR SUBJECT. A COMPLAINT ALMOST TWICE AS OFTEN AS INDEPENDENT HOME. FACILITY OWNERS HAVE USED COMPLICATED OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES TO OBSCURE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATIONAL CONTROL LIMIT LEGAL EXPOSURE A CONTRACT TO RELATE. TO RELATED ORGANIZATIONS THAT INFLATED RATE. SB SIX FIFTY IS ABOUT ENSURING QUALITY RESIDENT CARE BY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND AGAINST ALL THE INDUSTRY FROM FROM PROFIT CENTERS TO TRUE CARE CENTERS. OUR MEMBERS KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO NOT KNOW WHO THE OWNER IS NOR WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORKERS AND RESIDENTS. REPORTED OF SB SIX FIFTY WILL BRING MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY TO THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY AND ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE ARE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE QUALITY OF CARE. PROVIDED TO RESIDENTS AND FOR THE PROTECTION. FOR THE WORKFORCE RATHER THAN INTERCROPPING SHE IMPRACTICAL BRING. ON NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WORKERS MADE. ISSUES THAT ARE IN THE INDUSTRY CAN NO LONG BE A- I WOULD THINK FOR YOUR- AND WAS. REQUEST I. THANK YOU. TONY TICKETS- FOR CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOR NURSING HOME REFORM. OBVIOUSLY THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN BEYOND HORRIFIC FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AND STAFF AND THAT'S WHY CANTOR AT THE ARE YOU A. R. P. SENATOR STERN A LOT OF OTHERS WANT TO TAKE ARE AWFUL pFOR NURSING HOME REFORM SB SIX FIFTY IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PROTECT PLAN A PACKAGE OF BILLS. AIMING TO REPAIR BREAK DOWN THE LONG TERM CARE PROTECTED SO THE RESIDENTS AND STAFF FROM HARM THAT IN IT THAT WAS REALLY ENABLE BY POOR POLICY. MUCH OF THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY BROKEN. FOR SOME NURSE HOMEOWNERS THERE. AND IS NOT TO PROVIDE HIGH CALL CARE TO MAKE. THERE'S A REASON WHY WE CALL THEM FOR PROFIT. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY UNSUCCESSFUL IN ALIGNING QUALITY OF CARE WITH PROFIT IN FACT WE HAVE NOT DONE UPSIDE DOWN SYSTEM. WHAT THE WORST NURSING HOMES CAN BE THE MOST PROFITABLE. SINGLES ARE INCREASINGLY USING RELATED PARTY COMPANIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEMSELVES. THEY PAY THE RELATED PARTIES INFLATED RATES AND TAKE TAKE ITS PROFITS OFF THE BOOKS. THIS IS THE PREDOMINANT WAY OF OPERATING A FOR PROFIT NURSING HOME IN CALIFORNIA. THE REALLY BAD APPLES USE RELATED PARTIES TO RUTHLESSLY STRIPPED MONEY AWAY FROM CARE. THE REST USE RELATED PARTIES TO HIDE THEIR PROFITS TO JUSTIFY RENT SEEKING FROM THE STATE EVERY FEW YEARS. IT'S A RESIDENT TO BE A BRUNT OF THE FINANCIAL GAINS. I'M NOT SURE I CAN ADD. TO THE DISH. WITH NO HOME AND TURN STUFF AMONG RESIDENTS CERTAINLY. CO GOOD. IN MANY WAYS THAT STAGE FOR COVERT. SB SIX FIFTY REQUIRE DECISION MORE. ABOUT THE RELAY PART FINANCES- IT REPORT WITH. REPORTING OF X. WHICH RELATE PARTIES. THAT WILL GO MUCH FARTHER WHAT WE CURRENTLY GET.

WE'RE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS- UNRELATED PARTY- THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPORT PAYMENT- MULTITUDE OF VENDORS THAT MIGHT BE AN UNRELATED PARTIES COULD INCLUDE WORK COMP KERRIER GARDENERS ARE OTHER ANCILLARY CONTRACTS THAT. ALREADY NEGOTIATED WITH HERE WORK WITH THE WINNERS.

AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MODERATOR NOW SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE NOW TO THE COMMITTEE OF QUESTIONS A QUICK COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS EIGHT SEE ACTUALLY SEE CENTER GROVE FOLLOWED BY CENTER ROCKS AS IMMIGRANTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR- BRIEF STORY WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST STARTED- AND- EVERYBODY WAS TRACKING AND WE CHECKED THE FATALITIES NOW BUT WE WERE CHECKING THEM. VERY VERY- IMMEDIATELY ONCE THE PANDEMIC STARTED BACK IN MARCH- AND- THE MAJORITY OF AT THAT TIME IN MARCH AND APRIL POSSIBLY MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE MAJORITY OF THE FATALITIES BECAUSE OF CODE CAME FROM- ONE SKILL THEIR FEEDS A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN MY DISTRICT- ANOTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN INTO LARRY. AS WELL AS BAKERSFIELD- ERA OF COURSE I JUMPED ALL OVER MY POOR THE CALVET FASIR TELLING HIM TO GET IN THERE FIX THIS WHAT'S GOING ON HOUSING GETTING IN THERE HE KNOWS WHERE IS IT COMING FOR AND THAT KIND OF THING. HIS RESPONSE TO ME WAS IS THAT IT WAS- HE HAD NO JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY BECAUSE IT WAS THIS THESE FACILITIES ARE. REGULATED AND LICENSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO- I GUESS IT'S A BROAD QUESTION WHAT IN THIS BILL IS GOING TO- HELP. ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT WE HAD AN- NEED TO SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FATALITIES IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHEN THEY'RE REGULATED BY THE STATE AND WHAT IS GOING TO HELP THE STATE OPERATE BETTER SO THAT THESE FACILITIES- AT. HAVE LESS I DON'T SEE THIS BEING I DON'T WANT ANOTHER PANDEMIC BUT LESS FATALITIES ARE LESS ISSUES WHEN THEY'RE CARING FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. CENTER STERN MONTROSE THAT THROUGH THE CHERRY YEAH I THINK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THANK YOU CENTER GROVE AYE AYE. I WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR SITUATION- RIGHT IN MY OWN FAMILY ACTUALLY IT SAID ANDERSON HOME- IN MY DISTRICT AND- THAT WAS PART OF THE BEGINNING OF MY JOURNEY INTO THIS ISSUE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS HAPPENING- I THINK SHE LOST HALF HER FLOOR AND IT'S ONE OF THE PREEMINENT. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN LA. PUBLIC NONPROFIT BUT NEVERTHELESS LIKE HOW DO WE STOP THIS. PART OF THE PART OF THE CHALLENGES THIS STRAIN WE'VE PUT ON. THE WORK FORCE SIDE OF THINGS AND THE LIMITATIONS THAT WE'VE GOT- INABILITY TO SORT OF CONTAIN QUARANTINE MANAGE THESE THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE A WORK FORCE IS BEING SO HEAVILY IMPACTED. AND SO WHEN NOT ENOUGH THERE'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH DOLLARS IN OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW TO BE ACTUALLY FUNDING. THOSE WHO WORK IN OUR CARE ECONOMY TO DELIVER THE SERVICES THEY NEED HENCE YOU SEEN ALL THESE WAIVERS OF THE RATIOS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE NUMBERS ARE DISMAL- YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE ONE NURSE ON THE FLOOR FOR TWELVE. YOU KNOW PATIENTS AT A TIME WHO ARE SEVERELY IN NEED AND YOU GET BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU STRING THE SYSTEM THAT WAY THE IDEA OF THIS BILL IS IF THERE IS. FACT IN THE SYSTEM IF FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS THERE'S IF THERE ARE TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING WHERE ARE RELATED PARTIES ARE NOT NECESSARILY GIVING THEMSELVES LIKE THE BEST MARKET RATE THAT THERE'S ANY INSULATION IN THESE TRANSACTIONS AND THIS IS. YOU KNOW WE KNOW ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OR SO HAVE BEEN SPENT IN THIS AREA- BY FOR PROFIT UNIVERSITY ED FACILITY SO WE'RE DOING A VERY LARGE ECONOMY HERE SIX BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF TRANSACTING BUT IF THERE'S- IF EVEN HALF A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF. THAT SPENDING WAS INAPPROPRIATE- THAT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS NOW GETTING TO THE FRONT LINES BUSINESS WE THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO RADICALLY IMPROVE CARE WITHOUT US HAVING TO INCREASE TAXES OR GO AFTER OUTSIDE FUNDING IN THE GENERAL BUDGET BUT JUST TO MAKE THE PUBLIC. DOLLARS WORK BETTER SO THAT'S MY I ATTEMPTING YOUR CALL. THANK FOR YOUR CONCERN THANK YOU SIR I APOLOGIZE THEY'RE CALLING ME BACK TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE I'M KINDA DOING DOUBLE DUTY HERE- SO LIKE YOU I DO UNDERSTAND THAT AND- YOU KNOW THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WERE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN AND THE SITUATION WE HAD IN TWENTY TWENTY- I JUST AND I REALLY DO WANT TO SOLUTION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE INFECTED DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY GO BACK INTO THESE FACILITIES- AND- IN EFFECT GREATER NUMBERS OF THE POPULATION IN THOSE FACILITIES. I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL THAT I DO WANT TO SOLUTION I REALLY DO- BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THIS BILL OF FIXES THAT AND- YOU KNOW MOST THIS REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE LIKE FOURTEEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND- HELLO ALTHOUGH I DO KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE FACILITIES- THAT DO HAVE OPERATE IN THAT. PROBABLY THAT MILLION BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF SIX BUT FACILITIES THERE ARE A LOT OF- YOU KNOW AND- HUNDRED THAT DISABILITIES FIFTY BUT FACILITIES. THAT DON'T OPERATE IN THAT MANY STANDARD AND THEY ARE- IN IN ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED I GUESS ON THE MEDICAL SYSTEM BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT'S LIKE FOURTEEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR TWELVE AT TWELVE DOLLARS A DAY FOR A BED. ON A MEDIC CAL THERE'S ME YOU CAN'T EVEN PAY SOMEBODY ONE HOUR'S WORTH OF WORK- WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE OF ONE PATIENT AND SO- THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION THOUGH BECAUSE I REALLY THINK WE DO NEED A SOLUTION FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE. THANK YOU. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY THIS IS A COMMON BY THE WAY NOT A QUESTION. EFFORTS TO IMPROVE- TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARD TO THE OPERATION OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN THE STATE. TO DRIVE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE DOWN TO DIRECT PATIENT CARE WE CERTAINLY NEED TO DO THAT AND THE AUTHOR'S CORRECT AND THE OTHER ONE- COLLEAGUES ARE CORRECT IN. NOTING THAT THERE'S FRANKLY NOT ENOUGH MONEY. IN THIS AREA OF HEALTH CARE TO PROVIDE THE CRITICAL CARE THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE. TO RESIDENTS OF THE STATE UP AND DOWN THE STATE I DO HAVE SOME ISSUES IN SOME CASES SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES OR WITH THE PROCESS THAT'S BEEN DESIGNED- TO OBTAIN VISIBILITY OVER THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITIES THAT DO BUSINESS WITH. THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BASED ON WHAT I WAS ABLE TO READ IN THE AMENDMENTS AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN FLYING BACK AND FORTH. TO THE CREDIT OF THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE CHAIR- UP UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE THIS HEARING STARTED- BUT AS DRAFTED THE BILL APPEARS TO BE A BIT TOO BROAD. OF FRANKLY IN THAT IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THOSE OTHER ENTITIES CONTROLLED CONTROLLED. BY THOSE WHO CONTROL THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S THE CONTROL OF THOSE AFFILIATED BUSINESSES BY OWNERS OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT ALLOWS MONEY TO BE DIVERTED OR SIPHONED AWAY FROM THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE OF RESIDENTS ARE PATIENTS IN THESE FACILITIES. AND CONTROL IS NOT 1% CONTROL IS NOT 5% CONTROL IS CONTROL. OF THE AFFILIATED BUSINESSES CLEARLY IF WE'RE GONNA BE IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS. ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE ST OUT TO ACHIEVE AND SO. I OF FRANKLY BILL LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL I'M I'M COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT I INTEND TO VOTE AYE ON THIS BILL TODAY AND I SIMPLY REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR. AND THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL OF WORK ON THOSE CONTROL ISSUES AS THIS BILL HOPEFULLY MOVES FROM THIS COMMITTEE TO APPROPRIATIONS EFFECT FOR HIS NEXT AND THEN TO THE FLOOR SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY WILL E VOTING AYE BUT I WOULD ASK THAT THOSE ISSUES. BE ADDRESSED- PRIOR TO COMING BACK TO THE FLOOR IN MY HAVING TO VOTE ON IT AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I GUESS I WILL JUST- ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE AND THIS. AND THAT- WE WANT THIS BILL TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND I ALSO IT WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND- THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS PERSONAL TO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME HARDSHIPS. IN PARTICULAR THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL- CLOSELY RELATED TO ALWAYS GOING ON- IN IN A NURSING FACILITY BUT- I JUST WANTED TO SAY I YOU KNOW I DID ACCOUNTING WORK FOR FIVE YEARS AND SO I DO. THINK WHAT'S BEING ASKED HERE AND TO ASK THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE STATED IT'S- WE JUST NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL AND LANGUAGE AND I ALSO HEARD I BELIEVE IT WAS THE OPPOSITION'S COMMENT SAYING THAT THEY'RE ALMOST THERE AND THEY'RE- MAKING PROGRESS. AND I JUST WANT TO COACH THE OTHER TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IS JUST TOO IMPORTANT. NOT TO COME TO A SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. K. C. NONE- S. R. STERN. I WANT TO THANK YOU AND THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH ME AND THE STAFF- I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW. THAT THERE IS STILL STILL SOME MORE WORK TO DO- AND- SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE- FINANCIAL. AUDIT ISSUE I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT WE NEED TO ACT OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND I UNDERSTAND THAT SPONSORS SAID THAT. THEY AGREE THAT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BE SURE THEY'RE ACCURATE AND THAT THEIR MEETING FOR EIGHT AND SO WHAT KIND OF GUARDRAILS OF SOME OF THOSE DETAILS WE STILL HAVE TO WORK OUT. I THINK WE'RE STILL WORKING ON BUT CONCEPTUALLY WE ALL IN IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU AND- THE SPONSORS WORKING WITH- THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND DO YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO GET US THAT DIRECTION I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS WELL. THAT- WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO. DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO FINE TUNE THIS BUT REALLY APPRECIATE THE PROGRESS AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO BECAUSE AGAIN WE DON'T WANT TO SEE. FUNDS THAT WERE PUT IT ACTUALLY TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THE MEDICAL SIDE. YEAH AND BEING DIVERTED AWAY FROM ACTUAL PATIENT CARE- THAT'S BEING PROVIDED BY A PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES SO. WITH THAT AGAIN WILL BE SAID THANK YOU WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL- AND- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD TAKE YOU MISTER CHAIRED WITHOUT CALM. AB MEMBERS- I'M JUST. TOO FACTUAL POINTS NOTE MY CLOTHES AND THEN I'LL I'LL I'LL RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- YOUR AYE VOTE- WHEN IT COMES TO THE- QUESTION OF THE AUDITOR THE NATURE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING GOING FORWARD. WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN- CLARIFYING THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT'S- FEASIBLE THE BILL DOESN'T EXPLICITLY ACTUALLY CALLED FOR AN AUDIT IT'S A CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT- BUT- THERE. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF AMBIGUITY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING ASKED FOR- SO I WOULD LOVE TO GET. CLARITY ON THAT BEFORE THE FLOOR THEN. SENATOR ROSS POINT AS WELL- WHEN IT COMES TO THIS DEFINITION. OF RELATED PARTY- AND THE COMMON OWNERSHIP DEFINITION NESTED IN THEIR- WE MAY HAVE. CONFUSE THINGS A LITTLE BIT BY NOT JUST CITIN TO THE CODE. THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS THE CFR THE DEFINITION IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY JUST MIRRORS THE CFR- SO AS WE GO FOR JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND AND BUT WE WANT TO KEEP WORKING THROUGH THAT JUST FORGET WHERE IT MAKES SENSE TO ACTUALLY DEPART FROM THE EXISTING FETTER. FEDERAL DEFINITION AND NOT- SO THANKS FOR LET ME GO INTO THE WEEDS A LITTLE BIT ON THE ON THE CLOTHES THERE BUT- THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT DETAILS AS YOU ALL RIGHT WE KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT OUR OWN CONSCIENCE. ABOUT TAXPAYERS WHO ARE PAYING TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE ACTUALLY GETTING WHAT THEY PAID FOR WHICH IS SOME SEMBLANCE OF DIGNITY FOR THE PER PEOPLE WHO SERVE THEM AND FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN. LANGUISHING ALONE FOR THE LAST YEAR I OFTEN IN SILENCE SO THANK YOU FOR IN ADVANCE FOR SPEAKING UP FOR ALL OF THEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER STERN- ACTUALLY STORE MOTION ON THE BILL.

THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH. FOR OUR CHILDREN THIS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE THEY WERE CUT OFF UNEXPECTEDLY FROM THEIR FRIENDS THEIR TEACHERS THEIR COACHES THEIR TEAMMATES. IN SOME CASES THEIR EXTENDED FAMILY MEMBERS. THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE TOUGH QUESTION HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS WAVE OF CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN THE CONTEXT OF TRAUMA. THAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING. EXPERTS HAVE WARNED THAT THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS A TRAUMATIC STRESSOR THIS DRAMATIC STRESSOR MAY LEAD TO A WHOLE GENERATION. OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE. IT'S BEFORE TWENTY EIGHT EXPANDS THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES. IT REQUIRES COMMERCIAL INSURANCE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR CASES SCREENING. RECENT RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE LINK BETWEEN ACES AND A DECLINE IN THE INDIVIDUALS LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CURRENTLY REIMBURSES PHYSICIANS WHO TAKE A SUS TRAINING. WILL PROVIDE A SCREENING TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR COMMERCIAL PAYERS TO COVER A SCREENING. THANKS MANY COVERAGE OF A SCREENING NOW DOCTORS WILL BE ABLE TO MIGRATE WITH. MITIGATE WHAT MAY HAVE BECOME A COMPOUNDING TRAUMA IN THE FUTURE. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TODAY JOINING US REMOTELY DR MARTY BOMB A PEDIATRICIAN WHO PERFORMS A SCREENING AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE.

A SCREENING BEGAN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE JUST FIFTEEN MONTHS INTO SCREENING EXPANSION OF SERVICES AND GAINING MOMENTUM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- WELL WE'VE HAD A LOT OF. BILLS TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RECENTLY I'M UP FOR IT THIS ONE A COUPLE MORE- TODAY I'M PRESENTING SP FOUR SIXTY FIVE AND ONE ACCEPT THE CRIPPLING AMENDMENTS LAID OUT THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE FOR HELPING. OVER CODE WE'VE BEEN DESPERATELY LOOKING AT JUST ALL KINDS OF WAY OF LOOKING AT. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND WHAT KIND OF WASTE WHAT COULD WE DO TO IMPROVE IT WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING IN THEIR- AND SOMETIMES WERE FRUSTRATED WITH THE- WAY IT MOVES AND SO. WE THINK THIS BILL ADDRESSES. TWO ISSUES THAT WILL WILL HELP THINGS. FIRST THIS BILL. TO FOR SERIOUSLY. DISTURBED TO EXPAND ELIGIBILITY. FOR MENTAL. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDED SERVICES FOR KIDS. THIS BILL SPLITS OUT TWO CRITERIA THAT ARE REQUIRED IN COMBINATION CURRENT LAW AND MAKES THEM DISTINCT. M. IN OTHER WORDS BEFORE WAS THERE TOGETHER AND WE'RE GONNA SEPARATE THOSE OUT THAT SHOULD BE CALLED AS HE DEAR SERIOUSLY EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED UNDER DISORDERED THIS UNDER THIS BILL ELIGIBLE FOR THESE FUNDS AT HER WOULD STILL REQUIRE ADDITION DIAGNOSIS AND DEMONSTRATE BEHAVIORS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THEIR AGE THE CONCERN NOT FORCING YOU TO BE INAPPROPRIATELY LABELED UNDER THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT WITH THE AMENDMENT TODAY. AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT INCLUDING THIS BILL ANYTHING TO FURTHER-STIGMATIZE OR HARM YOUTH IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WE SIMPLY WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS BILL THIS BILL IS ABOUT THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH ARE A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE INVESTMENT THAT WE PUT INTO EVERY SINGLE YEAR- UNDER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS ARE PROGRAMS THAT EMBODY THAT WHATEVER IT TAKES APPROACH TO HELP THOSE DEALING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES. SOME COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY STARTED LOOKING AT HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE THE SERVICES. AND TWENTY NINETEEN THE FRESNO COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REQUESTED. TO APPROVE A MULTI COUNTY A PROJECT TO RE FRAME. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS AROUND AN OUTCOME ORIENTED APPROACH THAT REMAINS CLIENT CENTERED. ADDITIONALLY L. A. COUNTY HAS STARTED TO WORK ON A PROJECT WITH THIRD SECTOR TO FACILITATE AN AGENCY WIDE SHIFT. TO AN OUTCOME ORIENTED IT. AN WAY. THIS BILL FOLLOWS THAT LEAD FOCUSING ON HAND HOW THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS- ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MOST DIRE OUTCOMES FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS. CRIMINALISATION HOSPITALIZATION AND HOMELESSNESS. AS BEFORE SIXTY FIVE REQUIRES THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE SERVICES AND OUTCOMES FROM THE F. FS PEACE. WITH A FOCUS ON PREVENTING INCARCERATION HOMELESSNESS AND HOSPITALIZATION. IT ALSO REQUEST RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THESE OUTCOMES. I THINK THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT pAHEAD OF US IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE'RE LOOKING AT MAJORLY OVERHAULING A LOT OF THINGS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ALREADY DO. AND THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THE OUTCOMES OF IT. I THINK THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND I HAVE RENTAL HAGAR AND JIM GROSS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PSYCHIATRIC. POSITIONS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA.

THE KERN SEVEN ZERO THE BILL ON. LET'S NOW MOVE TO I'D NUMBER TEN SB FIVE SIXTEEN AGAIN BY AND- THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I. SAY THIS BE THE FOR MIDDLE BILL TODAY I THINK THERE'S MORE COMING BUT THIS IS JUST FOR TODAY- I THINK CENTER ALONE IS GOING TO TAKE US IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION BUT TODAY I'M PRESENTING SB FIVE SIXTEEN A BILL THAT I THINK HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACT AS A NARROW. AND SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENT TO OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS CAN BE HELD FOR TREATMENT INVOLUNTARILY IF THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA DANGER TO THEMSELVES. OTHERS WERE UNABLE TO FIGHT PROVIDE FOOD CLOTHING SHELTER. TYPICALLY WE THINK ABOUT THIS IS A FIFTY ONE FIFTY OR SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD. PEOPLE CAN BE RELEASED. AT THE END OF TO BE TWO HOURS OR HEARING CAN BE HELD TO DETERMINE WHETHER THAT CONDITION REQUIRES ADDITIONAL INTENSIVE TREATMENT. THE COURT TO RECONSIDER STILL WHETHER THAT PERSON. IS GRAVELY DISABLED THE INITIAL CRITERIA THAT PEOPLE. THEM WERE EVALUATED UNDER- IT ENTERTAINER IF THEY'RE ABLE TO ACCEPT NECESSARY TREATMENT THIS CALL THE FIFTY TO FIFTY OR CERTIFICATION REVIEW UNDER THIS YEAR. THIS CONDEMNED SOMEONE TO BE HELD FOR UP TO. TWO WEEKS GENERALLY OR LONGER IF INDICATED. UNDER THIS BILL A HEARING OFFICER WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CONSIDER INFORMATION REGARDING A PERSON'S MEDICAL CONDITION AS WELL AND HOW THEIR CONDITION BEARS ON THE CERTIFICATION OF WHETHER THEY ARE A DANGER TO SELF OR GRAVELY DISABLED WHEN DETERMINING. WHETHER TO CONTINUE TO HOLD A PERSON FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT AFTER THAT INITIAL SEVENTY TWO HOURS. CURRENT CURRENT LAW FAILS TO ADDRESS THIS PART ABOUT IT IS YOUR MEDICAL CONDITION INTERFERE WITH YOUR ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. HOW DO WE HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE LANGUISHED ON THE STREETS WITHOUT ADEQUATE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE WE'VE ALL SEEN THEM WE'RE DRIVING BY WE SEE PEOPLE ISSUES WITH THEIR FEET OR SHOES WITH THE CUTS- THINGS THAT ARE REALLY GOING ON AND THAT DEEMED THEM EVEN FURTHER. AT RISK AND FURTHER IT WILL FIND PEOPLE IN A HOSPITAL PERHAPS LOSING A LAMB AND PERHAPS EVEN DYING OR IN A LONG TERM FACILITY OR- GUARD AB. IF YOU FROM JUSTICE FACILITY FOR WAY TOO LONG. I KNOW THESE ARE TOUGH ISSUES THAT WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WE ARE NOT TRYING TO GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM WE ARE TRYING TO MORE ADEQUATELY TREAT. THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM AND CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVE THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. I'VE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DISARRAY STAFF- TO BILLS AMENDMENTS ABOUT WHAT A MEDICAL CONDITION IS AND WE'RE BACK HERE TO HEALTH- TO BE CLEAR NOTHING IN THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR MANDATED MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ONLY SEEKS TO RESTORE AN INDIVIDUAL'S CAPACITY TO CARE FOR THEIR NEEDS- THIS BILL I BELIEVE CAN HELP PEOPLE AND I THINK IT. STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN. PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PERSONAL RIGHTS. AND MAKING SURE THEY STAY SAFE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND WITH ME HERE TODAY. IS AGAIN. RANDALL HAGAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION AND JIM GROSS IF PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE IS OR WHAT THIS IS A SUPPORT- RANDALL HAGAR AGAIN FROM THE PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA AND JIM GROSS OF THE SAME- BRING THE HUNGER PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LEVEL ACRE CAMPUS IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS APPLY CALIFORNIA- THE DOCTOR EGGMAN TO REALLY GOT IT RIGHT THERE ARE VERY INCONSISTENT CERTIFICATION DETERMINATIONS BECAUSE SOME HEARING OFFICERS IN COURTS. DO AS SOME OFFICERS GO ACCEPT EVIDENCE OF A MEDICAL CONDITION AS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF GREAT DISABILITY THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL FIXES AND IN DOING SO IT HELPS US TO PREVENT. OR TREAT HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE UNFORTUNATELY SUFFERING FROM ON THE STREETS AND IN SOME CASES DYING- WE CAN'T LET PEOPLE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL BLACK THE CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES AND ALSO HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS- WE CAN'T LET THEM FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS WE CANNOT. AFFORD T LET THEM MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT THEY- WITHOUT TREATMENT IF THEY DO SO THEY WILL RETURN AND I'LL BE WORSE IN BOTH RESPECTS AND ARE MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS SO WE- ARE BRING THIS- IN THE HOPES THAT WE CAN MAKE. THIS VERY SMALL CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE A VERY LARGE. DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IT'S THIS MR GOING TO BE JIM GROSS GOING TO BE TOUGH.

HAVE BEEN RECENTLY SO THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TO LEAVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AVAILABLE FOR TESTING THAT IS DEEMED EXPERIMENTAL OR INVESTIGATIONAL. BROADENED THE DEFINITION OF BIOMARKERS TO INCLUDES UNEDITED. PHENOTYPIC EIGHT. AND APPLY THE BILL TO MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE STREAMLINES THE BIOMARKER TESTING PROCESS BY PROHIBITING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR BIOMARKER TESTING IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED OR METASTATIC STAGE THREE AND FOUR CANCER. BIOMARKER TESTING LOOKS AT PATIENTS GENE MUTATION DRIVING THE CANCER TO HELP MATCH THEM TO EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENTS TREATMENTS TARGETED AT THE GENETICS OF A PATIENT'S CANCER IMPROVE SURVIVAL RATES AND QUALITY OF LIFE BOTH THE MYERBERG- TEST AND TARGETED THERAPY ARE EACH SUBJECT TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION BY HEALTH PLANS AND BOTH MUST BE SEPARATELY APPROVED BY THE PLAN FOR THE PATIENT TO GET ACCESS TO THE TARGETED THERAPY. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION CAN CAUSE DELAYS ANYWHERE FROM A FEW DAYS TO A FEW WEEKS WHICH IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH THE APPROPRIATE TARGETED THERAPY FOR SPECIFIC BIOMARKER TESTING THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TREAT THEIR DISEASE SLOW RECURRENCE OR PROGRESSION AND LEAD TO A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. MANY OF US UNDERSTAND PERSONALLY THAT PATIENTS AND FAMILIES SUFFERING FROM CANCER ESPECIALLY IN THE LATER STAGES DESERVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THIS BILL HAS RETREAT IS RECEIVED STRONG SUPPORT LIST IN THE ANALYSIS AND- ALSO AS- SORRY IS RECEIVED AS STRONG SUPPORT WAS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS- AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY AT WE HAVE DOCTOR STEPHEN WONG FROM UCLA HEALTH SYSTEMS AFFILIATE AND KRISTEN SANTIAGO WITH LONG LAUNDRY TIVITY.

ON WHENEVER HE- SO CAN BRING THEM ON THE LINE I BELIEVE DOCTOR WONG IS THE FIRST ONE TO BEGIN AND AGAIN IT'S TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS TOTAL FOUR MINUTES SO I GIVE A TWO MINUTE WARNING THAT MEANS YOU'RE STARTING TO EAT INTO THE OTHER PERSON'S TIME. SO DOCTOR WONG. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. PLEASE BEGIN HELLO OKAY VERY GOOD. RESEARCHER MEMBERS MY NAME IS DOCTOR STEPHEN ONE. I'M AN INDEPENDENT USUALLY TRAIN ONCOLOGISTS AND FORMER ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE UROLOGY UCLA. WHO CO AUTHORED A PUBLISHED A MAJOR DISCOVERY OF BREAST CANCER AND THAT IS THE THIRD TO LOGGING WHICH IDENTIFIED A VERY AGGRESSIVE DISEASE. IDENTIFICATION OF THIS GENE INVOLVING INTO A VERY IMPORTANT BIOMARKER I CURRENTLY WORK IN SEVERAL ONCOLOGY PRACTICES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA. SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE ADDRESSES A- VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE ONCOLOGY CARE THAT IS A DELAY IN PATIENT TREATMENT CAUSED BY PILOT THURSDAY SHOULD PROVIDE A MARKET TESTING. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT GENES SUCH AS THE HER TWO AND MANY OTHER BIOMARKERS IN MANY CANCERS MUST BE IDENTIFIED FOR MOST OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT RESULTING IN. IMPROVED PATIENT HEALTH AND SURVIVAL. THERE'S NO A PLETHORA OF BIOMARKERS NECESSARY FOR OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT FOR BEST OUTCOMES IN CANCER. AS A PRACTICING ONCOLOGIST I PERSONALLY HAVE. EXPERIENCED DELAYS TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND GETTING BIOMARKER TESTS APPROVED FOR PATIENTS. TO HEALTHCARE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS. BUT STILL IT CAN VERY FROM HEAT IS THE FUTURE YOU'VE HEARD. DEPENDING ON THE PATIENT'S HEALTH INSURANCE AND OTHER- BARRIERS IN SOME CASES THE PATIENT NEVER RECEIVED ABOUT MARKETERS BECAUSE THE POSITION DOESN'T HAVE THE STAFF OR RESOURCES OR MOTIVATION TO DEAL WITH THE PROCESS. PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PAPERWORK AND SUCH ABANDON THE PROCESS THIS COOL IN THE SPORT CARE. FOR ANY CANCER PATIENT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE STAGED REPORT CANCER METASTATIC CANCER. DIESEL IS GETTING THE BIOMARKER TESTS PROVED. MEANS A DELAY IN STARTING APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. THE ARGUMENT THAT COST WOULD BE EXORBITANT OUTWEIGHED BY THE EXPERIENCE AT INSTITUTING THE MOST APPROPRIATE THERAPIES THAT MOST ACOSTA. BERICHTETE I HAVE SEEN CANCER PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED AND METASTATIC CANCER START INAPPROPRIATE THERAPY BECAUSE- THEY CAN'T GET THE BIOMARKER TESTS APPROVED IN TURN. LEADING TO SUBOPTIMAL CARE OF THE PATIENTS. AND POTENTIALLY REDUCE OVERALL PATIENT RESPONSE AND SURVIVAL. AS A COLLEGES WE WANT TO PROVIDE OUR PICNIC. OUR PATIENTS THE BEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR THIS PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. FOR BOND MARKET TESTING FOR PATIENTS WITH CHANGE THE REPORT CANCERS IS ONE. AND VALUABLE STEP FOR. HELLO AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STERN MON ARGUES SUPPORT THE BUDGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH OF THIS NOW MOVES TO KRISTIN. HE EXACTLY TWO MINUTES YOU HAVE TO MAKE. PERFECT THANK YOU CHAIR AND OF THE COMMITTEE THANK CENTER LIMóN FOR INTER THE LETTER LIKE THAT IN MY- I AM CHRISTMAS. AND I WORK FOR THE LONG TIME FOUNDER HARD TO SAY- BUT IT'S A LONG VACATION AT.

MY ON AND ARE FAMILY ARE LAW. THAT SHE HAD PUSHED AND TO BUY MARKET. WITH DELAY DO TO PRIOR AUTHOR. WHICH WOULD LIGHT CARE. AND FOR NOT EVERYONE IS SO LUCKY AND THAT IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. ALL PATIENTS SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TIMELY GUIDELINE DAYS BIOMARKER TESTING REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHETHER THEY RECEIVE THEIR CARE IN A LARGE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTRE OR IN A SMALLER COMMUNITY SETTING. I AM A PROTECTING IS STANDARD OF CARE FOR MANY TYPES OF CANCER AND SAVE LIVES. THIS BILL WILL HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY SICK AND DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY TO WAIT FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO BE COMPLETED. BEFORE THEY RECEIVE BIOMARKER TESTING. CLINICAL GUIDELINES RECOMMEND BIOMARKER TESTING TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE TREATMENT OPTIONS. ANYTHING THAT DELAYS BIOMARKER TESTING WILL DELAY WHEN A PERSON CAN START. THEIR INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT. PRIOR OFF. PROVIDE TESTS. PROCESS TO CAUSE FROM PAUL DELAY FOR PAY. HI AUTHORIZATION BY MARK TESTS WHICH IS- ENOUGH THAT SORRY PRIOR PROVIDE HAS- IT IS GOES AGAINST STANDARD OF CARE REQUEST RIGHT STANDARD OF CARE WE FOLLOW GUIDELINE- AND IT'S AN EXTRA STEP THAT IS NOT NEEDED AND CAN LEASE RIGHT.

SO ONCE YOU'RE ON THE LINE AGAIN FOUR MINUTES TOTAL TWO MINUTES PIECE AGO TWO MINUTE WARNING POINT TWO MINUTES SO LET'S BEGIN WITH NICKEL RECESS. SO ONCE NECKLACES ONLINE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THIS IS NICHOLAS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE. AS IT IS IN PRINT TODAY OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BENEFIT MANDATES IT IS VERY WELL INTENTIONED AND I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT I HAVE HAD WITH THE OTHER STATUS. OF ANY COMEDIANS OUT AS WELL HOWEVER IT IS A BENEFIT MANDATE AND WE GENERALLY OPPOSE THEM BECAUSE EITHER INCREMENTALLY OR EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE PREMIUMS. ON INDIVIDUALS FAMILIES AND EMPLOYERS. I FELT VERY CALM EFFECTIVE THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS RELATIVELY MODEST BUT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE COLLECTION OF MANDATES BEING PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVELY. WITH RESPECT SPECIFICALLY TO SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE OF THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 1100% OF ENROLLEES OF HEALTH INSURANCE DO YOU HAVE BENEFIT COVERAGE FOR BIOMARKER TESTING. ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS FOR YOU PROGRAM. THE ISSUE THEN IS WHETHER THESE TESTS ARE COVERED BECAUSE THEY ARE COVERED. THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL IN PRINT IS THAT IT CHANGES THE WAY THE COVERAGE FOR BIOMARKER TESTING IS REVIEWED. IN A MANNER THAT WOULD COMPEL COVERAGE. OR MENTAL OR NERVOUS. CONTEST THAT. REALLY WANT TO BE PAID FOR THEIR PRODUCTS THAT THEY DEVELOP BUT ACCORDING TO OUR HEALTH PLAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS. SOME OF THE GENETIC BIOMARKER DATA SAID INTO THE MARKET ARE NOT BACKED BY THE EVIDENCE OR MEDICAL LITERATURE. I KNOW THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY- ARE TO TEND TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE AND WE WILL DEFINITELY REVIEW THEM. TO SEE IF THEY WORK. ON AND GET BACK TO BE OFFERING COMMITTEE OF ABOUT WHETHER THE IMPACT. OUR POSITION MOVING FORWARD. SO YOU MIGHT. TO WERE DIRECTED TOWARD THE BILL IN. THAT WE HAVE SOME MORETO DO REAL THE MEN TAKE TODAY. WE WILL DO NOTIFY AUTHOR UP AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUDGET WE DO READ REMAIN IN OPPOSITION TO THE- YOU KNOW IMPRINTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NO SPRING ON PER. YOUNG FOR THE CAN CHAMBER. AFTER MR IN COMMITTEE PRESS FOR YOUNG THE CAL CHANGE OF COMMERCE I'D LIKE TO ASK OF THE CENTER MISTER LOUISA AND EXPRESSING- FOR THE STATE OF THE ARE IN WE'RE WITH THE- WE WILL ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT THE MEN. AND HOW THEY IMPACT OUR ON THE BILL AS THE BILL IS TODAY WERE STILL IN OUR BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY SB FIVE FIVE IS A WELL INTENTIONED BILL BUT IT BECAUSE- SOME CONCERN INTO AFFECT ONE OF PRIOR OFF. WAIVER AND THE OTHER BECAUSE IMPACT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE ON EMPLOY AND EMPLOYEES SO THAT FIRST CAN BY A MORE TEST THE NEW A- PERSONALIZED. THERE'S LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CAPITAL HAND ACT DICTATE TREATMENT. BIOMARKER TESTING. HOPE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL SO THAT CONCERN NUMBER ONE AND THEN THE SECOND CAUSE FOR CONCERN OF THE JUST MENTIONED THE COST IMPACT THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE. BASED ON THE SUBURBAN HOUSES OBVIOUSLY THE COST IMPACT- THAT NEEDED TO BE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INCREASE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS AND THAT'S NOT HUGE INTERNET AT ALL HOWEVER. IF YOU DO LOOK AT THIS IN CONTACT WITH ALL THE OTHER BENEFIT MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. THE COLLECTIVE- IMPACT THAT THEY WILL HAVE ON EMPLOYER PREMIUMS. IS- FAIRLY DRAMATIC INTO LOOKING AT THE SPECIFICALLY FROM AN EMPLOYER BASED PERSPECTIVE THERE'S EIGHTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT HAVE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE THROUGH AN EMPLOYER PLAN. AND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL PREMIUM FOR FAMILY COVERAGE OF OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO- IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THIS HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT YEAR FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND A BIG PART OF THAT STRUGGLE BEEN AFFORDING HEALTHCARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES SO. AGAIN SB FIVE THIRTY FIVE AS WELL INTENTIONED CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT AND- IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE. THAT EMPLOYERS ARE GOING THROUGH A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT TIME IN TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT FACT WHEN WE DO- APPROACH IS THAT MANDATES SO AGAIN LOOK. TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS. SAID IN. GETTING I ON THE AND- WHAT DIRECTION GO THANK YOU SO MUCH FREE TIME OPPOSED TODAY. THANK YOU THAT'S NOT MOVE ITS ON ADDITIONAL. AND OF BILL- SO LET'S MOVE TO THE GALA SAID ON THE PUBLIC OUR LET'S MOVE ROOM TO FORTY. SAN ANDREAS FORTY- I PLEASE OPEN THE- TO WITNESS WHICH IS. IN OP. TO SB THIRTY FIVE. IT'S NAME OR EXIT AND DOES ONLY. THANK MISTER AND LAY AND IF YOU TO SPEAK AND OPPOSITION OF B. THIRTY PM PRESS ONE AND THEN THERE AT THE TIME. MIND TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN THE ONE ELEMENT PLEASE. OF MINE TO. IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE AND THEN. ZERO NINE TWO TWENTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THAT THE ONE IS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES. TODAY HAVE BEEN OPPOSED BUT LOOK FOR TO RECEIVING AND THEN IT IN ABOUT ANY OPPOSITION GOING FOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT I. I DON'T. COME IN Q. OKAY THANKS FOR MUCH OF. NOW OF COURSE OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBER. OKAY SENATOR. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR- I AM AMONG YOU TELL ME WHAT THE CAR OF THIS IS I AM IT BE. MINIMAL TO DO TESTING FOR CANCER TREATMENT OR CAN'T SEE IF YOU ARE THE CANCER. S. CELLS. THE SO I THE OVER COST OR THE PER TEST IT DID I MEAN THIS IS INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT SO IT DEPENDS AND I THINK AS ONE OF THE OPPOSITION- INDIVIDUALS TESTIFYING IT STATED THIS IS OUR IT'S COVERED- FOR FOLKS IT WHO WHO HAVE ACCESS TO IT AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE COST. OF THE BILL IMPRINTED VERSES THE COST OF THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING- COULD ALSO DIFFER BECAUSE WE DID TAKE BE AMENDMENTS TO LEAVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR TESTING THAT IS DEEMED EXPERIMENTAL OR INVESTIGATIONAL. SO I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER FOR YOU. OKAY SO BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE THE ESTIMATE IS BASICALLY TWO CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH YES- THAT SUBURBAN HOUSES CORRECT THAT IS THE ANALYSIS TO CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH- TO HAVE THIS. EXTRAORDINARY TESTING THAT WOULD GIVE YOU AN INDICATION IF YOU HAVE CANCER. AND DO YOU CONSIDER THAT. TOO MUCH. DO I CONSIDER TWO CENTS PER. I DO NOT CONSIDER TO SENSE NEITHER DO I MA'AM SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE BANK TO. OKAY THANK YOU CENTER GROVE I WILL MAKE NOTE THERE IS A SUBURBAN NOW IS SO WE HAVE A SOME OF THAT AND THE ANALYSIS BUT- TERMS OF THE COST AND THAT THE TWO CENTS PER MEMBER PER MONTH WAS. SPECIFICALLY CALPERS HMS. OKAY ARE THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THREE MEMBERS. OF THE- SO. OKAY SO THIS. OCTOROK LIKE TO MAKE A BOMB- ACTUALLY THE QUESTION AFTER TOWARD YOU DOCTOR SO.

AT THE LATE SO THAT IT ACTUALLY. DID THE OPPORTUNITY TREATING. AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE FOCUS AGAIN ON PEOPLE STATE STREET FORCE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SEVERE. FORMS OF CANCER WHERE IT'S CAN BE LIFE OR DEATH SO I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO BE AS WORRIED BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CENTER LAMONT.

THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT- SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR TODAY AND FOR THE TIME THAT YOU AND YOUR STAFF OF SPENT ENGAGING WITH ME ON AN ISSUE THAT I KNOW WE ALL TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. AS WE STAND HERE TODAY. WE ALL HOPE THAT THE WORST OF THIS PANDEMIC IS OVER. WE LOOK TO THE COMING SUMMER WITH HOPE AND OPTIMISM. BUT AS WE DO. WE SHOULD PAUSE AND GIVE AND GRIEVE OVER THE LIVES OF MORE THAN SIXTY THOUSAND OF OUR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN CUT SHORT BY COBIT NINETEEN. THIS INVISIBLE BUT DEADLY VIRUS THAT HAS BROUGHT US SO MUCH MISERY IN OUR STATE. WE SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY MINDFUL THAT MOST OF THOSE WHO THAT WHO HAVE DIED. WE'RE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY. EITHER BY VIRTUE OF BEING POOR. FOR ELDERLY ARE CHRONICALLY ILL FOR BECAUSE THEY WERE AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO RISKED THEIR LIFE. TO HARVEST OUR FOOD TEND TO THE SICK OR KEEP US SAFE. AS WE DO LOOK BACK ON ALL THOSE LIVES LOST WE SHOULD ALSO ASK OURSELVES. WHAT COULD WE HAVE DONE DIFFERENT. AND IF GOD FORBID SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN. WHAT COULD WE DO BETTER. ULTIMATELY STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THE HIGHLY INFECTIOUS VIRUS COMES DOWN TO HUMAN BEHAVIOR. A VIRUS SPREADS VIA ACTIVITY THAT COMES SO NATURALLY TO ALL OF US AND SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US CRAZY SIMPLE HUMAN INTERACTIONS WITH OUR FAMILY WITH OUR FRIENDS HI EVEN WITH STRANGERS. PREVENTING THE SPREAD REQUIRES PEOPLE TO CONTAIN ALL OF THAT INTERACTION. AND AT TIMES UNPLEASANT AS IT MAY BE IT REQUIRES OUR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT HUMANS FROM INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER. IF WE ARE TO DO THIS AND IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISIONS THAT GOVERNMENT MAKES IT A TIME OF SUCH STRESS IN PERIL. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT OUR DECISIONS BE BASED ON DATA. AND SCIENCE. AND THAT WE SHARE THE INFORMATION THAT POWERS THOSE DECISIONS WITH THE PUBLIC. THINK OF HOW MANY TIMES. YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED OVER THIS PAST YEAR TO EXPLAIN THE DECISIONS THAT THE STATE HAS MADE. WHY ARE SOME SCHOOLS OPENED AND SOME CLOTHES. WHILE I WAS OUTDOOR DINING BAND WHILE INDOOR MALLS WERE OKAY. ARE WE TOLD THAT FRESH AIR AND VENTILATION WERE KEY BUT WE SHOULD STAY INSIDE OUR HOMES WHY CAN'T I GO OUT AND GET MY HAIR CUT OR EVEN STYLED IF I WEAR A MASK WHY CAN'T MY KIDS PLAY SPORTS. OUTSIDE IF YOU ARE LIKE ME YOU WERE ASKED THESE QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND WERE UNABLE TO ANSWER THEM BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER SHOWN THE DATA THAT BACKED UP THOSE DECISIONS. THIS LACK OF PUBLIC DATA HAS LED TO A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL POLICIES. THAT HAVE LED TO A LACK OF ADHERENCE TO THESE GUIDELINES. THAT WILL LEAD TO MORE INTERACTIONS WERE INFECTIONS. OR HOSPITALIZATIONS AND SADLY MORE DEATHS. TO DO BETTER WE NEED IF YOU WILL NORTHSTAR THE NORTH STAR TO GUIDE NOT JUST OUR PUBLIC POLICY BUT OUR PERSONAL DECISIONS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL HAVE FAITH IN. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. SB SEVEN FORTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO COLLECT AND MAKE AVAILABLE MORE DATA. ABOUT THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE ARE MORE THAN A YEAR INTO THE CODE NINE PANDEMIC WE STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE SCIENCE SUPPORTING OUR BELIEF ABOUT THE HEIL THE HOW THE VIRUS IS SPREAD AND WHICH MEASURES ARE MOST EFFECTIVE IN SHOWING INST SLOWING OR STOPPING THAT SPREAD. IN THE FUTURE PANDEMIC WHICH IS THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. WE NEED MORE THAN INTUITION AND ANECDOTES WE NEED SCIENCE AND GOOD SCIENCE DEPENDS ON GOOD PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON THE ISSUES THAT HAVE DIVIDED CALIFORNIANS THIS PAST YEAR OPEN CLOSE OPEN CLOSE. EVERYONE SHOULD WANT TO HAVE THE KIND OF DATA THAT CAN GROUND THESE DECISIONS. WHILE THE STATE IS COLLECTED AT LEAST SOME DATA ON NEARLY FOUR MILLION CASES VERY LITTLEOF THAT INFORMATION IS SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY. CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES A STATEWIDE SUMMARY OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA INCLUDING AGE SEX AND ETHNICITY. BUT LITTLE ELSE. AND EACH COUNTY THERE HAVE BEEN. GUIDELINES ON DISCLOSURES. BUT IT REALLY HAS COME DOWN TO RUBIK'S CUBE OF SCRAMBLED INFORMATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN IN RESPONSE TO YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND PROTECTING PRIVACY AS A GOAL THAT WE BOTH SHARE. I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. IF ENACTED IMPROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. IT WILL GIVE BONA FIDE RESEARCHERS BETTER AND QUICKER ACCESS. TO DATA THAT TAKEN THAT CAN FUEL THEIR STUDY THAT COULD SAVE LIVES. UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME TO A SIMILAR pAGGREGATED DATA. THAT WOULD HELP POLICY MAKERS CRAFT BETTER DECISIONS AND HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE RISK OF VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. BUT EVEN WITH THE MODEST EXPANSION IN THIS BILL AS AMENDED. WE WILL STILL BE PROVIDING FAR LESS INFORMATION AND SO MANY JURISDICTIONS. ROSS THE COUNTRY. THE NEW TAUGHT US I JUST ONE EXAMPLE THE STATE DISCLOSES SUMMARY DATA THAT SHOWS WHETHER COVERT PATIENTS WERE INFECTED BY KNOWN CONTACT PROVIDE COMMUNITIES SPREAD AND WHETHER THERE'S A SUSPECTED EXPOSURES OCCURRED AT HOME IN A SOCIAL SETTING A WORKER FROM TRAVEL THERE'S NO REASON CALIFORNIA CAN'T DO AS MUCH FOR OUR RESIDENTS OR MORE. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU AND OTHERS IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD TO TRY TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. MEMBERS WE HAVE AFTER GROCERY CLERKS ARE HEALTH CARE WORKERS OR TEACHERS ARE FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHERS TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS AWFUL AND HISTORIC TIME. WE'VE ASKED OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO SHELTER IN PLACE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. TO STAY SAFE. YET THEY HAVE ALL PUT AT FURTHER YET THEY HAVE ALL BEEN PUT AT FURTHER RISK BY THE DATA DESERT THAT KEEPS POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC. FROM KNOWING AS MUCH AS WE SHOULD AND AS MUCH AS WE COULD ABOUT THIS DISEASE. WE HOPE THAT WE WILL NOT SEE ANOTHER PANDEMIC IN OUR LIFETIME OR IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIFETIME. THAT EVEN AS SOME MAY FEEL A SENSE OF RELIEF. AS VACCINATIONS RATES GO UP. LAST WEEK THE PLANET SET A NEW RECORD FOR THE NUMBER OF COBIT CASES DIAGNOSED. AND OTHER STATES IN OUR COUNTRY OR SEEN RENEWED SURGES. THE MORE THE DISEASE LIVES ON THE MORE VARIANCE IT PRODUCES IN THE GREATER THE RISK THAT EVEN CALIFORNIA COULD SEE ANOTHER SEARCH. FINALLY MEMBERS IMAGINE IF YOU COULD GO BACK TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND YOU WERE AND WE HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. WHAT WOULD YOU DO DIFFERENTLY TO TRY TO SAVE AS MANY. AS POSSIBLE OF THOSE SIXTY THOUSAND LIVES WHAT COULD WE DO DIFFERENTLY. THE SINGERS THAT SINGLE THING THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE MOST IN OUR CONTROLS INFORMATION. IN A PANDEMIC INFORMATION SAVES LIVES AND WE HAVE THE POWER TO GATHER IS TO USE IT AND THE SHERIFF. IF IT WERE AVAILABLE. AND IF IT WERE AVAILABLE THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT. MATTER AND WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO PROVIDE THEIR TESTIMONY AS WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU CENTER GLAZIER- I WANT TO BE JUST VERY CLEAR BECAUSE YOU MADE A STATEMENT BUT I WANNA BE SURE THE MEMBERS IS COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND.

THE PUBLIC RELEASE OF AGGREGATED DATA. AND THAT IS NOT PART OF THE MAN IS THE PROPOSAL THAT CHAIRMAN. OKAY OKAY SO. I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE NOT AN ON WORDS BUT- BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT AGGREGATED DATA BUT YOU ALSO SPECIFICALLY SAID YOU WERE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS EXCEPT FOR ONE WHICH HAD TO DO WITH AGGREGATED DATA AND THAT I TOLD HER I COULDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IF YOU DID THAT BUT NOW YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS SO TO ME THAT WOULD FIT YOUR ALSO ACCEPTING THE ONE THAT I ASKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

INABILITY OF THE STATE TO USE DATA TO GREATER RISK BASS RESPONSE TO TARGET RESOURCES AND INTERVENTIONS TO LIMIT THE COLLATERAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY BROAD BASED STATEWIDE POLICIES BECAUSE OF DECADES OF FUNDING CUTS TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE STATE IS LIMITED CAPACITY TO ANALYZE COLLECTED DATA. FOR THE MORE THE DATA COLLECTED INCOMPLETE AND INSUFFICIENT TO CREATE A SIGN PLEASE RESPONSE EXAMPLES OF THAT FAILURE WITH THE INDISCRIMINATE CLOSURE OF OUTDOOR SPACES PLAYGROUNDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF UNFOUNDED INTERVENTIONS LIKE DEEP CLEANINGACTIVITIES. ON THE FLIP SIDE THE LACK OF GOOD DATA USE RESULTED IN AN ECLECTIC ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THE FAILURE TO IMPLEMENT TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED THE FURTHER SPREAD OF INFECTION SENATE BILL SEVEN FORTY FOUR WILL BE A STEP TOWARD RIGHTING THE STATE'S DEL PUBBLICO SYSTEM BY ADDING.

THANK YOU NEXT LINE. DOCTORS AT THE TIME HAVE NO FURTHER IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE MISTER CHAIR. OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY THE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE- LET'S NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MADE BEFORE WE BEGIN- MAYBE I JUST WANT TO COULD GO OVER WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE I KNOW YOU JUST GOT HANDED DOWN BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS- AGAIN WHAT THINGS THAT- WE WANTED TO DO IS- ACTUALLY INCREASED THE DATA DATA FIELD SO WE HAVE. SO THERE'S MORE CONSISTENT COLLECTION OF DATA- PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO AGAIN HOUSING YOUNG PEOPLE MAY ALSO THINK THAT YOU WOULD GET ACTUALLY FROM CONTACT TRACING- SO IF YOU'RE OF CONDUCTING CONTACT TRACING YOU IT IS INFORMATION THAT YOU DO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY LIVE SIDETRACKED HOUSING YOU'D HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WORKPLACE YOU HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT TRAVEL HISTORY BECAUSE THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONTACTS AND SO FORTH. UPDATED YOUR NUMBER OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH- I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT OF THAT SO THAT THE STATE CONNECTION COMPILE THIS DATA ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTIES I DO KNOW THAT DEMANDED TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH PROVIDERS I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS ON HEALTH PROVIDERS ACTUALLY COLLECTING THIS DATA AND TO THE DEGREE THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO ANSWER THIS ACTUALLY THIS IS A CHALLENGE THAT- THAT I THINK CENTER WIENER AND I WORKED ON AND TRY TO COLLECT SOME DATA REGARDING. FOR EXAMPLE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND JUST FOR HAVING TO FIELD ACTUALLY GETTING THE DATA ON THAT THE OTHER PART THAT WE DID IS THAT- WE DID CREATE A MECHANISM BY WHICH RESEARCH BUT A FIGHT RESEARCHERS AND- YOU TO PROTECT PRIVACY COULD ACTUALLY OF ACCESS TO DATA BUT THEN HAD TO KEEP COULD NOT RELEASE INDIVIDUAL DATA AGAIN TO PROTECT PRIVACY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALSO DONE WITH OTHER DATASETS AS WELL- SO THEY'D HAVE TO DO IT ONLY UNDER A BONA FIDE EMMA YOU. AND THAT WE DID DELETE IT- TURN THE PARTS THAT CALLED FOR- ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC YEP BOB. PUBLIC CATION. MANDATED PUBLIC REPORT- UNDER DISCUSSION INCOME. OF DATA TO ENSURE. WE IN. REQUIRED A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE. DATA IN A WAY THAT COULD COMPROMISE PRIVACY RECOGNIZING I THINK IT'S A MENTION BY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT. EVEN IF THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE D. INDEMNIFIED. IT SOMEONE COULD READ DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF WHAT THE REPORT IS YOU CAN REVERSE ENGINEER IT TO FIGURE OUT LIKE- IT'S CERTAIN NUMBER CASES IN CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS SO FORTH. SO AGAIN TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS AND THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAVE THAT DISCRETION. SO JUST ONE AGAIN GO OVER WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE INVOLVED- SO WITH THAT I SEE A CENTER WIENER HAS THIS- MICROPHONE UP YES. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- THANK YOU FOR THE BILL- CENTER GLAZER- AND THAT'S CHAIR MENTIONED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. WE WORKED ON. WE REALIZED EARLY ON IN THE PANDEMIC THAT DATA WAS NOT BEING COLLECTED. ON THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND COVERED IMPACTS AND SO WE- WE DID PASS LEGISLATION IS HERE WORKING WITH US OUR LAST YEAR WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE- TO REQUIRE- DATA COLLECTION AROUND COVE AND OTHER REPORTABLE. REPORTABLE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES RELATING TO SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY I DO JUST WANNA STAY HUMBLE STATUS AGAIN. THOUGH WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT DATA BACK BILL HAS BEEN IN THE FACT THAT LAW HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF HIS URGENCY. FOR I WON'T USE ANY SWEAR WORDS RIGHT NOW WITH THEIR SWIRLING AROUND IN MY HEAD BUT FOR SEVEN YOU KNOW WHAT MONTHS. SEVEN MONTHS THAT HAS BEEN THE LAW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE STILL DO NOT HAVE THAT T. C. PH HAS LIMITED DATA ABOUT CONTACT TRACING. BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL COVERT TESTS WE DO NOT HAVE MORE THAN VERY SPORADIC INCONSISTENT DATA. AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS YOU KNOW I'VE SIGNIFICANT FRUSTRATIONS WITH CDPH AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. BUT THERE'S ALSO ISSUES OF HOW- HOW LIVES REPORT RESULTS SINCE THE DATA GETS COLLECTED AND THEY GOT STRIPPED OUT. BECAUSE THE NATIONAL. LAB STANDARDS DON'T INCLUDE THOSE FIELDS SO THIS WILL APPLY TO THESE FIELDS AS WELL THE NATIONAL STUDENT LAB STANDARD SETTING ORGANIZATION. WON'T HAVE THESE FIELDS AND SO THEY'LL THEY'LL ASK A WHEN YOU GET YOUR BLOOD WORK. BUT THEN IT'S GOING TO GET STRIPPED OUT SO IT'S IT IS ABSOLUTELY MADDENING AND I'VE ENORMOUS FRUSTRATIONS. WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR NOT DEALING WITH THIS FOR NOT WORKING IT OUT FOR NOT FINDING A WAY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING- THE STATE AND I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR. THAT WE HAVE A AND MORE FORTUNATELY WE SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF MORE MOVING CLOSER TO THE LIGHT AT THE END OF TOWN. TOWN OVER THIS PANDEMIC. BUT IT'S BEEN A HUGE LOSS OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF DATA COLLECTION- AND I KNOW CENTER CABALLERO HAD A BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE WHERE I THINK THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR BETTER. DATA COLLECTION BY IT IS A STRUCTURE ALL ISSUE IN OUR HELL CARE SO- AND ASSIST X. AND BECAUSE HARM IN A CALL HARM. DURING THE SPEND. ON SAUDI HI I SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT INFORMATION I'M GLAD THAT THE ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY DISCLOSURE WORKED OUT THIS DATA WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE TO HEALTH OFFICIALS TO. RESEARCHERS AND I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO GET AGGREGATED DATA- CAL IN A WAY THAT IS USABLE- TO- TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE AND TO AND TO FOCUS RESOURCES. BUT BOY DO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE IT'S A COMPLETE MESS I'LL BE HONEST. RIGHT OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BUT YES THERE ARE LENDERS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SO FIRST I WANT TO THANK SENATOR GLAZER FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND I KNOW THIS- PROBABLY WAS A TOUGH PUSH- GIVEN ALL THE CHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE IN THIS BILL BUT- FIRST YOU KNOW. WE'VE HAD SEVERAL CHANGES TO THIS BILL JUST DURING THIS HEARING THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN MADE AWARE OF IN. WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION IN THE SUPPORT PRIOR TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ANNOUNCING WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WERE IN KIND OF EXPLAINING WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE AT THE BILL SO I'M JUST. EIGHT CONCERNED THAT. PERHAPS THEIR OPINIONS OF CHANGE OR PERHAPS THEY HAVE SOME INPUT- NOW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE AMENDMENTS ARE AS AS DO ALL OF US IN OUR I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WE'VEALREADY HEARD FROM THEM I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE STILL ON THE LINE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY- SHARES MY CONCERN BUT I THINK. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR IT HASN'T CHANGED HER MIND OR ARE THEY NOW OKAY WITH THAT OR ARE THEY REALLY OPPOSED TO IT NOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I THIS IS A TOUGH SPOT FOR US TO BE IN DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS I NEED MAYBE PERHAPS- GET. THIS SHIP IT IS TRY TO AND I DON'T SPEAK FOR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS- TRYING TO STAND IN CRAFTING THESE AMENDMENTS- WE DID WE DID- SHARE THEM WITH- THE PEOPLE AT PRIVACY CONCERNS AND- THEY WERE. BOB YEAH SO THE DEALER OF AMENDMENTS AND YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE TRY TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS I'LL TELL YOU THE HEALTH OFFICERS AND HEALTH EXECUTIVES THERE CONSISTS YOU FRY HEARD THEIR CONCERNS ISN'T JUST ON THE PRIVACY OTHER THEY HAD THOSE CONCERNS THEY ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON THE DATA COLLECTION AND THE WORKLOAD AND STABILITY TO GET THE DATA ITSELF- SO DIED EXPECT THEY WILL REMAIN OPPOSED BECAUSE WE ARE CALLING ON THE LINE THAT'S ON THE MIDDLE PART OF THE BILL IS CALLING ON THEM TO ACTUALLY COLLECT AND ARGUE AND MAINTAINED- MORE DATA SO THAT YOU HEARD THEM. BASS PARTY OPPOSITION WAS THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GET THE STATE- AND SO FORTH BUT WERE CALLING ON THEM THAT NO YOU NEED TO TRY HARDER TO DO THAT. SO THEIR OPPOSITION PRICES UNCHANGED BECAUSE OF THAT. OKAY AND THANK YOU FOR THAT- IT'S I WILL TELL YOU I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A HARD TIME HEARING THEM AND UNDERSTANDING THEM BUT I CERTAINLY DID THE PHONE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THE PHONE LINE SAY OR IF IT'S THEIR PHONE LINE BUT- I HEARD AND- MAYBE HALF OF WHAT THEY SAID TO THAT TO FRUSTRATION TO IT JUST WASN'T VERY CLEAR- SO. THEN I IF I COULD MOVE TO- PERHAPS. PERHAPS POSING A QUESTION TO- THE AUTHOR JEREMY. ASSISTANCE IS WILLING TO ANSWER YES. I THANK YOU- SO SENATOR GLAZERS- AND THIS IS HOW I UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND THE SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS IS THAT- ESSENTIALLY. ABOUT THE BALK AT THE CONTACT TRACING IS NOW BEING PUSHED DOWN TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS- IT IS THAT WOULD YOU SAY THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BILL- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE- BROADER STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT TO EVERY COUNTY FACES THIS IS NOT MY INTENTION TO DO- WHITING WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT I WANT TO ROBUST CONTACT IN TRACING OPERATION IN EVERY COUNTY AND SOMETHING THAT THE STATE'S STRUGGLE TO BE ABLE TO DO. THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC THE STATE COLLECTS THIS INFORMATION TO DIFFERENT WAYS THROUGH THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER AND THEN TO CONTACT TRACING HOPING THAT THAT COMMUNITY COORDINATED SO THAT THAT THAT INFORMATION CAN BE DONE IN A IN A IN A IN A SYNCHRONIZED AWAY SO WE I DON'T WANT DUPLICATION AND I WANT TO FISH AND SEA AND SO THAT'S THE GOAL HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR WONDERFUL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ON THAT ONE PART OF THE OBJECTION TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND A PATHWAY. THROUGH THAT I HEARD THEIR CONCERNS. OKAY BECAUSE- JUST WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE FIRST TWO. PARAGRAPHS HERE OF THE AMENDMENTS IT LOOKS AS THOUGH. I MEAN AREN'T WE KNOW WHEN INFORMATION WE WANT TO BE SHARED BETWEEN THE COUNTY THE LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH- WE ARE ASKING THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION GIVE IT TO CD PH WHICH IS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S INFORMATION THAT. PRIOR TO THIS POINT WAS INFORMATION THAT CDPH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE GATHERING IN IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM IT DO I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. YES SIR BUT SO BASICALLY IT'S POSSIBLE IN THE PROCESS OF INTERVIEWING SOMEBODY ELSE DOING THE EXAM AND SO FORTY MY COLLECTED SOME OF THIS INFORMATION BUT I- NOT A REQUIREMENT HE ALSO BE COLLECTED THROUGH CONTACT TRACING THAT USUALLY IT'S DONE BY THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT RIGHT OKAY GETTING BUT WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS IT'S NOT THE POSITIONS THEMSELVES WHO ARE COLLECTING THIS DATA- REQUIRED TO COLLECT NOT CONSISTENTLY NO OKAY THANKS I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE HAD. GREAT EVEN WHEN- YOU KNOW WE HAD THE INCIDENT LAST YEAR. AS YOU RECALL WHERE. THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS- HAD A MEMBER WHO CONTRACTED CODED. NONE OF US WERE CONTACTED BY LOCAL COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. TO DO ANY CONTACT TRACING. WITH CLEARLY SO I THINK THAT MARK SURE POINTS THAT THERE'S A BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATION BUT I UNDERSTAND. THAT HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS SAYING. YOU KNOW WE'RE SO WANTED TO BEGIN WITH AND BEING ABLE TO COLLECT THIS DATA AND THEN GET IN A TIMELY MANNER TO PUBLIC HEALTH IS. A LITTLE MORE THAN WE CAN BEAR- BUT I AGREED THAT WE'VE GOT AND COORDINATE THIS EFFORT BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING I MEAN. THE CONTACT TRACING JUST IS NOT WORKING SO- THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION I APPRECIATE THAT. HELLO RIGHT BILL'S BEEN BILL BY SERRATORE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OKAY SAYING NONE- SYSTEMS LATER FIRST OF ALL- I KNOW WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE BILL I HOPE I HAVE EXPRESSED AND GENERAL SUPPORT OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I WILL JUST HAVE TO EXPRESS THAT IS CHAIR OF A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT- YOU WAITED UNTIL LITERALLY WALKED UP THERE- TO NOTIFY US YOU DID ACCEPT AMENDMENTS IN FACT THE LAST WE HEARD YOU WERE NOT SET UP TO GET APOLOGIZE TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE CONFUSION THAT THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THEN OF COURSE ALSO MAKES A LITTLE CONFUSING FOR THE PEOPLE TESTIFIED AS WELL SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN NOT REPEAT THAT IN THE FUTURE TALK ABOUT THINGS GOING TO FUTURE BUT I ALSO THINK THIS BILL DOES ADDRESS SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS WE NEED TO MOVE IT FORWARD. SO WITH THE FACT THAT YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE BILL- AND ALSO I THINK DEAL WITH IT HE SAID THAT- PERHAPS WE CAN ALSO DO SOME ADDITIONAL WORK TO FINE TUNE IT- BUT- WITH THAT- IT WILL. HELP WE'LL LOOK GET IT OFF THE- OF. YOU CAN TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS. AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL.
