00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:45.892
WAS INTRODUCED. THAT ALONE IS

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:50.563
FRUSTRATING. WHAT MAKES IT WORSE

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.664
IS THE CLAIMS MADE BY THAT

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:53.900
LETTER. ARE MISLEADING

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.702
MISLEADING TO SAY THE LEAST IT

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:00.139
OFTEN. SO OFTEN TIMES SIMPLY

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:04.911

DRIVERS AS THE OPPOSITION

00:09:09.248 --> 00:09:11.050
CLAIMED IN THEIR LETTER. AS THE

00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:12.485
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE BILL

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:14.020
WOULD SHIP SOME RESPONSIBILITIES

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:16.155
FROM RETAILERS AND RESTAURANTS

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:16.889
THE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.263
UNCLEAR WHO THE PENALTY FALLS ON

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.731
AGAIN IT'S THE ANALYSIS POINTS

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:28.067
OUT THESE FALLS WOULD FALL ON

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.902
THIRD PARTY DELIVERY COMPANIES

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:34.140
THAT'S ON PAGE FOUR LINE

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.207
SEVENTEEN AND IT MAKES IT

00:09:35.274 --> 00:09:37.143
PERFECTLY CLEAR. FOR THOSE WHO

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.245
DON'T BELIEVE ME I WELCOME THEM

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.680

ANALYSIS OF THE BILL IF THAT'S

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:43.482
NOT ENOUGH I SUGGEST REACHING

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:45.351
OUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ABC SO

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.919
THE DEPARTMENT CAN PROVIDE THEM

00:09:46.986 --> 00:09:48.955

INSISTED ON EMPLOYEE STATUS.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.831
THEN USE A BILL PASSED IN

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.499
GEORGIA IS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH

00:10:00.566 --> 00:10:02.702
CLAIMS. BY COMMITTEE STAFF SPENT

THING. WHAT GEORGIA BILL DOES

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.317
IT'S THE SAME THING THAT HAS TO

BE EIGHT FORTY SIX WEEKS TO DO.

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.320
IT ALLOWS FOR ALCOHOL TO BE

BACKS OF VULNERABLE WORKERS AND

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.794

RETAILERS ASSOCIATION

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:17.296
CALIFORNIA'S RETAILERS HAVE BEEN

00:13:17.363 --> 00:13:18.864
USING THIRD PARTY DELIVERY

00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:20.166
COMPANIES TO MAKE DELIVERIES

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.535
INCLUDING ALCOHOL SALES FOR A

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.637
NUMBER OF YEARS. AS THE CHAIRMAN

00:13:24.703 --> 00:13:25.738
SAID CONTRARY TO THE

OPPOSITION'S POSITION THIS IS

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:29.141
NOT A NEW AUTHORITY AND THIS IS

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.543
NOT NEW AUTHORITY BEING GRANTED

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.178
THIS BILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.646
CLOSES AN IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.915
GAP IN THE ABC'S OF THE WORDING.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:36.949
BECAUSE THIRD PARTY DELIVERY

00:13:37.016 --> 00:13:38.350
COMPANIES ARE NOT ALCOHOL

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:40.553
LICENSEES THE ABC CANNOT AFFORD

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.588
ENFORCE AGAINST THE COMPANY. IF

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.023
A DELIVERY IS MADE TO A MINOR

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.991
INTOXICATED PERSON IRONICALLY

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.860
THE ONLY OPTIONS THEN LEFT IT TO

00:13:47.927 --> 00:13:49.828
THE A. B. C. R. TO ENFORCE

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:50.796
AGAINST THE RETAILER EVEN THOUGH

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.032
THEY HAVE MADE NO MISTAKE IN THE

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:53.532
PROCESS OR THE DRIVER

00:13:53.599 --> 00:13:55.634
THEMSELVES. THERE IS AUTHORITY

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:57.102
UNDER CURRENT LAW TO ENFORCE

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.771
AGAINST THE DRIVER THAT'S NOT

00:13:58.837 --> 00:13:59.738
CREATED BY THIS THAT'S IN THE

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.373
PENAL CODE WHEN PROVIDING

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.408
ALCOHOL TO A MINOR IS AGAINST

00:14:02.474 --> 00:14:04.977
THE LAW. SO EVEN THOUGH THE

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:06.212
OPPOSITION IS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.013
WHAT THIS BILL MAY DO RELATIVE

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.215
TO THE DRIVERS IT ACTUALLY HAS

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.583
AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT THE

DRIVERS AND AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

00:14:12.251 --> 00:14:14.186
PROTECT THE RETAIL COMMUNITY AND

00:14:14.253 --> 00:14:15.788
MOVE THE RESPONSIBILITY WHERE IT

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.156
BELONGS TO A THIRD PARTY

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:20.192
DELIVERY COMPANY. IF A MISTAKE

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.327
IS MADE. SO THIS BILL

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:23.295
SPECIFICALLY BY CLOSING THE GAP

00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:25.531
REQUIRES COMPANIES TO SECURE A

00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:27.032

MINIMIZED AND IF THEY'RE MADE

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:39.111
THEY CAN BE PURSUED AGAINST THE

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:40.913
DELIVERY COMPANY THEMSELVES.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.715

EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT HAS NOT

00:37:56.374 --> 00:37:57.842
BEEN INVOKED ON SUCH A WIDE

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:00.011
SCALE IN MODERN TIMES IT WAS

00:38:00.077 --> 00:38:01.712
WRITTEN TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC

00:38:01.779 --> 00:38:04.448
TYPES OF EMERGENCIES LIKE FIRES

COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TYPE OF

REPRESENTING CALIFORNIANS FOR

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:20.758
GOOD GOVERNANCE A COALITION OF

00:39:20.825 --> 00:39:22.293
VOTERS WHO WERE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:23.894
HOW THIS PROLONGED STATE OF

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:26.764
EMERGENCY IS ERODING DEMOCRATIC

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.666
NORMS IN OUR STATE. ALTHOUGH WE

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:31.068
ARE NON PARTISAN. MANY OF US ARE

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:33.170
LONG TIME DEMOCRATS WHO NOW CALL

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.406
OURSELVES POLITICALLY HOMELESS

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:36.607
BECAUSE WE NO LONGER SEE OUR

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:39.643
PARTY STANDING UP FOR SOME OF

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.412
OUR CORE VALUES. I PERSONALLY

00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.247
HAVE BEEN A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT

00:39:43.314 --> 00:39:45.716
FOR THIRTY YEARS SENATOR DODD I

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:48.085
HAPPEN TO LIVE IN YOUR DISTRICT

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:49.220
. I'VE NEVER VOTED FOR A

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.988
REPUBLICAN BUT I WAS HAPPY TO

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:53.457
ACCEPT SENATOR MELINDA SAYS

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:55.826
INVITATION TO TESTIFY TODAY. THE

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.294
QUESTION POSED BY THIS

00:39:57.361 --> 00:39:59.997
RESOLUTION IS NOTHING LESS THAN

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:01.899
WHETHER OUR STATE WILL ABANDON

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:04.335
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS BETWEEN

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.669
THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:07.171
THAT IS ENSHRINED IN OUR STATE

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.907
CONSTITUTION. THIS IS NOT A

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.575
PARTISAN ISSUE AT LEAST IT

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:15.012
SHOULD NOT BE. TO BE CLEAR THIS

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.981
RESOLUTION IS NOT A REFERENDUM

00:40:17.047 --> 00:40:18.349
ON ANY SPECIFIC PUBLIC HEALTH

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:20.017
POLICIES ARE IN GOVERNOR

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:22.052
NEWSOM'S LEADERSHIP. THE

00:40:22.119 --> 00:40:23.120
QUESTION POSED BY THIS

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.855
RESOLUTION IS NOT WHICH POLICY

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:27.258
SHOULD BE ENACTED BUT WHO SHOULD

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.226
BE CRAFTING THOSE POLICIES. OUR

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.628
STATE GOVERNMENT LIKE OUR

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.163
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DESIGNED

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:33.564
TO USE CHECKS AND BALANCES TO

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:35.666
GUARD AGAINST THE INHERENT

00:40:35.733 --> 00:40:38.402
DANGER OF ANY ONE PERSON GAINING

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:40.771
TOO MUCH POWER. THE EMERGENCY

00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.373
SERVICES ACT ALLOWS THE

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:44.475
EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO TEMPORARILY

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.177
USURPED SOME LEGISLATIVE POWERS

00:40:46.243 --> 00:40:47.845
WHEN THE PRICES REQUIRES SWIFT

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:50.047
ACTION. BUT IT REPRESENTS SUCH

00:40:50.114 --> 00:40:52.016
AN EXTRAORDINARY DISRUPTION TO

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:54.852
THE BALANCE OF POWER THAT IT

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:57.054
MUST BE LIMITED IN DURATION. THE

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:58.756
JUDICIAL BRANCH SO FAR HAS

00:40:58.823 --> 00:41:00.291
ESSENTIALLY PUNTED THE ISSUE

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:02.226
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:41:02.293 --> 00:41:04.195
ACCORDING TO THE THIRD DISTRICT

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.629
COURT OF APPEAL WOULD SAVE THE

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:07.765
EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT FROM AN

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:10.167
UNCONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION OF

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:11.769
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS IS THAT

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.971
THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE POWER

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:16.173
UNDER SECTION EIGHTY SIX TWENTY

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.975
NINE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE. TO

00:41:18.042 --> 00:41:19.410
TERMINATE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.445
IF THE CUB GOVERNOR REFUSES TO.

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:24.148
BUT IF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.183
WILLING TO CONSIDER AND GOOD

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.219
FAITH WHETHER THE EMERGENCY IS

00:41:28.285 --> 00:41:30.521
OVER THE NOT SAFEGUARD IS

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:33.991
MEANINGLESS. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:36.260
THE CRISIS IS A POWER GRAB GRAB

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.595
FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS FAR

00:41:37.661 --> 00:41:39.897
FROM NORMAL. THIS IS GONE ON

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.098
THROUGHOUT HISTORY AROUND THE

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.067
WORLD AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.669
STATE LEGISLATURES AND COURTS

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.404
HAVE HAD TO REIGN IN THE ABUSE

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:49.940
OF EMERGENCY POWER. BY GOVERNORS

00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:52.209
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS PEOPLE

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.912

SOCIETY WE OFTEN TAKE OUR

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:59.617
DEMOCRACY FOR GRANTED. BUT

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:02.586
DEMOCRACY IS FRAGILE. IF WE

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:04.755
NORMALIZE SUSPENDING OUR USUAL

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.790
LAW MAKING PROCESS FOR A LONG

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:09.627
LONG PERIOD OF TIME WE CHIP AWAY

EXTINGUISHED. WELL GOVERNORS AND

00:56:14.104 --> 00:56:16.306
PRESIDENTS HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW

00:56:16.372 --> 00:56:18.308
TO DEAL WITH THAT. THEY NOW HAVE

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:20.844
A LOT MORE POWER. YEAH WHOSE

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:23.747

SUPPORT IT I THINK THAT THE ONE

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:17.467
PROBLEM HERE IS THAT DECLARING

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:20.170

TODAY WELL ANYTHING THIS BILL

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.179
PREVENTS THE GOVERNMENT FROM

TAKING RAPID ACTION IN THE

00:58:37.714 --> 00:58:38.815
FUTURE SHOULD THE STATE

MAKE SURE THAT ANY COULD SURGE

00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:58.835
THAT MIGHT COME AT US IN THE

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:00.236
FUTURE WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATELY

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.504
AND APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED WE

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:03.706

CALIFORNIA BECOMING IN- TO

FINDING THANK YOU SENATOR WOKE

TO THE CHAIR NOW THERE IS I KNOW

00:59:17.353 --> 00:59:19.155
THAT THE OPPOSITION IS TRYING TO

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:21.257
PRESENT THIS AS THOUGH WE WILL

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:23.693
LOSE OUT ON- ALL THE FUNDING IN

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.162
THE RESOURCES THAT WE MIGHT NEED

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:28.531
IN THE FUTURE IF. ANOTHER SURGE

00:59:28.598 --> 00:59:30.099
TAKES PLACE BUT THAT IS SIMPLY

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:32.402
NOT THE CASE AND I THINK THAT'S

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:32.969
FEAR MONGERING TACTICS THAT

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:35.705
APPARENTLY HAVE WORKED- QUITE

00:59:35.772 --> 00:59:39.075
WELL BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

00:59:39.142 --> 00:59:40.209
THANK YOU STORE SO ON MY OWN

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.278
TIME. REALLY ENJOYED THE DEBATE

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:44.180
TODAY BECAUSE IF TODAY WAS

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:46.783
FASTER THIS I COULD I COULD LIST

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.284
THE GOVERNOR'S MISSTEPS HIS OVER

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.453
REACH ANY SECRET DEALS IN LIKE A

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.188
CATALOG THEM ALL FOR YOU BUT

00:59:52.255 --> 00:59:54.791
IT'S NOT TESTED THIS I'M NOT

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.125
GONNA DO THAT. SO TO ME THIS IS

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:57.560
ALL ABOUT RESTORING THE

00:59:57.627 --> 01:00:00.163
CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE. BETWEEN

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:00.964
THE THREE BRANCHES OF

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.932
GOVERNMENT. AND TO SAY THAT WE

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.867
THINK WE CAN'T DO THAT WE JUST

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.235
DID THAT YESTERDAY IF YOU ALL

01:00:06.302 --> 01:00:08.037
RECALL WE DIDN'T LIKE A COURT

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.973
CASE AND WE PASSED SB ONE

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.108
EIGHTEEN. WENT TO HOUSE THE SAME

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:14.143
DAY GOVERNOR SIGNED IT THE SAME

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:18.081
DAY. SO ALL WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS

01:00:18.147 --> 01:00:21.017
TO GIVE THE PEOPLE'S VOICE BACK

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:22.685
ONE MAN RULE I THINK IT'S BEEN

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:25.188
DETRIMENTAL TO OUR SOCIETY. AND

01:00:25.254 --> 01:00:26.189
IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CLOSE THE

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.824
FACT I THINK LONG TERM ON

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.826
GOVERNMENT. AND YOU KNOW AS WE

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.361
PULL AWAY FROM THIS CREDIT FROM

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:35.965
THIS CRISIS. I HOPE WE CAN. LOOK

01:00:36.032 --> 01:00:39.635
BACK WITH LESS PASSION AND LOOK

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:41.404
TO SEE WHAT WE DID RIGHT AND

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.839
WHAT WE DID WRONG SO WE DON'T

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:45.341
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN I

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:45.908
MEAN I THINK TOO OFTEN. THE

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.377
GOVERNMENT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:49.312
WE JUST KIND OF YOU KNOW. YOU

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.314
LIKE CANCERS IN A WILL YOU KNOW

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:53.649
A CYCLING AROUND AND I THINK YOU

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:55.518
KNOW THE WORLD'S GETTING SMALLER

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.120
THROUGH GLOBALIZATION. I'M

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.421
ASSUMING WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.290
PANDEMICS NOT LAST IN WE DIDN'T

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.760
GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME. AND SO

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:04.994
WE HAVE A CHANCE AT LEAST GET

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:09.232
BACK ON. ON THAT ROAD BUT I

01:01:09.298 --> 01:01:09.932
THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT THING

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.901
IS THAT. WE NEED TO FIX THE

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.102
THINGS SAID THAT WENT WRONG THIS

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:14.837
TIME BECAUSE A LOT PEOPLE PAID

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:24.947
CONSTITUTIONAL BALANCE THAT THE

EITHER BE CONTINUED OR OR

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:38.187

FUNDING THE WAIVERS WE DISCUSSED

01:02:40.323 --> 01:02:42.492

FINDING AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.432
SOME CLARITY ON THE EXTENT TO

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:52.068
WHICH THIS WOULD WOULD HINDER

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.504
OUR ABILITY TO ACT QUICKLY. HOW

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.906
TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE IN

01:02:56.973 --> 01:03:00.042
THE IN THE- IN COVE IT AS IF

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.311
THERE'S ANOTHER SURGE OF CENTRAL

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:05.081
. SO A COUPLE OF ISSUES IF YOU

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.383
DON'T MIND WILL BOTH ANSWER ALL

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.017
TALK ABOUT THE HOSPITAL WAIVERS

01:03:08.084 --> 01:03:09.719
AND THEN MAYBE- BRIAN YOU CAN

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:11.287
TALK ABOUT THE FIELD- FOR THE

01:03:11.354 --> 01:03:12.922
HOSPITAL WAIVERS IT WOULD AND

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.857
SOME OF OUR FUNDING- BECAUSE WE

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:16.959
DO GET FUNDING THROUGH FEMA. IT

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:18.528
WOULD ALSO MORE IMPORTANTLY AND

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:20.163
THE WAIVERS I DISCUSS RELATED TO

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:22.765
BOTH OUT OF STATE. LICENSURE

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.734
THAT WOULD HAVE TO RUN. THAT

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.335
STRUCTURE CHANGES TO RUN THROUGH

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:28.371
THE LEGISLATURE IN RECORD TIME-

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.339
THE SENATOR- DID MENTION THAT

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:31.941
THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE BUT

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.609
UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE MASS

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:35.711
AMOUNT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE-

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.847
THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:40.449
THAT IS THROUGH. A PUBLIC-

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:42.652
EXECUTIVE ORDER- SO BOTH THE

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.820
HOSPITAL OUT OF STATE WAIVER AS

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.055
WELL AS THE SPACE WAIVER DETER

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:48.424
CRITICAL TO AGAIN. THE WALL TIME

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:50.493
ISSUES OF SEPARATING PATIENTS

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.961
PARTICULAR IMMUNO COMPROMISED

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.530
PATIENTS I AM IN ADDITION WHAT I

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.532
DIDN'T GET TO MENTION IS WE ARE.

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:59.068
SEEING A LOT OF PATIENTS COME IN

01:03:59.135 --> 01:04:00.002
SICKER BECAUSE THEY DELAYED

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:02.672
CARE. SO WHILE THE NUMBERS MIGHT

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:04.540
BE GOING DOWN OUR HOSPITALS AND

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:07.577
EMS SYSTEMS ARE. HIGHLY IMPACTED

01:04:07.643 --> 01:04:11.547
BECAUSE PATIENTS WAITED- LONGER

01:04:11.614 --> 01:04:12.949
TO GET THEIR CARE AND ARE COMING

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.451
IN STICKER- SO THERE'S STILL THE

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.987
PUBLIC EMERGENCY- EXECUTIVE

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.388
ORDERS ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.824
RECOGNIZE THIS AND- AND PULL

FOR THE FOR SERVICE ONE OF THE-

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.199
BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:32.535
HAVE WOULD BE SOME OF THE- RULES

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.303
IN THE ADAPTATION OF RULES THAT

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.205
ALLOW US TO DO CERTAIN

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.507
PROCEDURES IN THE FIELD- THAT.

01:04:38.574 --> 01:04:40.009
POTENTIALLY COULD GO AWAY AT A

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:42.578
TIME WHEN WE'RE STILL HIGHLY

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.848
IMPACTED- BY THE VIRUS. AND THE

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.216
PATIENTS THAT NEED OUR HELP THE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.252
OTHER ONE IS- OUR ABILITY TO

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.120
ASSIGN FIELD PERSONNEL INTO

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.855

TAKE IT AWAY IT DOESN'T. MATTER

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:08.638
HOW FAST YOU CAN BRING IT BACK

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:10.006
IF YOU'RE TAKING IT AWAY WHEN IT

PLAYBOOK. NOBODY HAD A PLAYBOOK

01:07:14.196 --> 01:07:14.897
ON THIS THING I THINK THE

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.899
GOVERNOR GOT RIGHT I THINK HE

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:19.201

HUMAN BEINGS WITH NO PLAYBOOK

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.976

TWENTY NINE OTHER STATES THAT

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:52.121
HAVE ENDED THEIR STATE OF

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:54.023
EMERGENCY ARE THEY ALL NOW AT

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:56.992
RISK. IF THERE IS A CODE RED

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:57.826
SERGE. DO YOU THINK THAT THEY

01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.995
HAVE NOT CONTEMPLATED WHAT MIGHT

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.931
HAPPEN. IF THEY HAVE ANOTHER

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.165
SURGEON THEY DON'T HAVE A STATE

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:06.902
OF EMERGENCY IN PLACE TWENTY

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.605
NINE OTHER STATES. SO THEY ARE

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:10.239
PUTTING THEIR CONSTITUENTS AT

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.808
RISK. THE THE OTHER EIGHT POINT

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.810
I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT YOU

01:10:14.877 --> 01:10:16.312
KNOW THERE'S SUCH A THING

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:17.746
CALLED. A STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:10:17.813 --> 01:10:19.848
DECLARED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:22.384
FACT I HAD ONE RECENTLY IN MY

01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:24.420
OWN CITY WHERE WE HAD A FIRE. WE

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:25.921
DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.023
THEN THE STATE KICKS IN AND THEN

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:29.158
FEMA CAN KICK IN AND

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:30.292
REIMBURSEMENTS ARE MADE AND

01:10:30.359 --> 01:10:32.227
EVERYONE IS TAKING CARE OF.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.363
THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE. AND

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.298
THAT IS STILL THE CASE TODAY WE

01:10:36.365 --> 01:10:38.400
DON'T HAVE A STATEWIDE SURGE OF

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.002
COVERED RIGHT NOW WE MAY NOT

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.370
HAVE ANOTHER STATEWIDE SURGE OF

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.439
COVERAGE SO RATHER THAN. USE

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.641
THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH

01:10:45.708 --> 01:10:47.543
OF KEEPING THE ENTIRE STATE IN A

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.345
STATE OF EMERGENCY WHY NOT

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:50.980
LOCALIZE IT WHY NOT ALLOW LOCAL

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:52.848
COMMUNITIES. IF THEY HAVE A

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.084
SURGE IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.285
DIFFICULTY WITH CAPACITY IN

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:57.186
THEIR HOSPITALS OR OTHER

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:58.954
SERVICES. ALLOW THEM TO DECLARE

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:00.856
STATE OF EMERGENCY AND THEN THE

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.124
STATE CAN STEP IN AND HELP IN

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.760
THE FEDS CAN STEP IN AND HELP IF

01:11:04.827 --> 01:11:07.229
NECESSARY. BUT TO DO SO. YOU

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:09.264
KNOW IT INTO ETERNITY DOESN'T

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.466
MAKE ANY SENSE I MEAN I'M

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:12.401

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:16.205
STATE OF EMERGENCY **** AND

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:19.008
THEY'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO SAY SO.

01:11:19.074 --> 01:11:20.442
SO IT GOES ON FOREVER. BECAUSE

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.077
THAT'S WHAT THE SUGGESTION WAS

01:11:22.144 --> 01:11:23.212
TODAY THAT IT JUST GOES ON

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:25.114

. SENATORS THIS MEASURE AS

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:42.871
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY ON THE

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.773
SENATE FLOOR IS OVER FOUR

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.141
HUNDRED DAYS OLD. AND THE STATE

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.677
OF EMERGENCY HAS BEEN IN PLACE

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:49.311
FOR OVER SEVEN HUNDRED DAYS IN

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.246
FACT THE STATE OF EMERGENCY HAS

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.749
BEEN EXTENDED THREE TIMES SINCE

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.784
IT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN MARCH OF

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:57.686
TWENTY TWENTY. THIS RESOLUTION

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.421
IS ABOUT ONE THING AND ONE THING

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.356
ONLY AND THAT I THE BALANCE OF

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.091
POWER. THE BALANCE BETWEEN

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.927
EXECUTIVE POWER AND LEGISLATION

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:07.796
LEGISLATIVE POWER TO BE PRECISE.

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.264
MANY OF THE GROUPS AND

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:09.965
INDIVIDUALS WHO OPPOSE THIS

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.166
RESOLUTION THINK THAT THE

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:12.901
STATE'S COVERT RESPONSE WILL

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.637
COME TO A CRASHING HALT AND IT

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.639
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY. LOCAL

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:18.907
GOVERNMENT WILL STILL HAVE THE

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:20.442
POWER TO DECLARE A LOCAL STATE

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:22.077
OF EMERGENCY IS TO NOTIFY THE

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:23.578
STATE THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.681
MEET A POTENTIAL SURGE. OF A

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.316
LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEELS EMERGENCY

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:29.117
ORDERS ARE NECESSARY TO TACKLE

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:31.019
AN OUTBREAK OR TRIAGE MEDICAL

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:33.121
RESOURCES AN EMERGENCY ORDER BY

01:16:33.188 --> 01:16:35.090
THE LOCALS ENGAGES STATE

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:38.493
RESOURCES. THIS IS PRECISELY HOW

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.429
EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WORKS FOR

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:41.964
WILDFIRES IN PRETTY MUCH ANY

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:44.366
OTHER DECLARED EMERGENCY. SO

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.100
WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW THE

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:47.002
GOVERNOR'S OWN WORDS OF LOCALISM

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.638
IS DETERMINATIVE. DURING HIS

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:52.341
SMARTER PRESS CONFERENCE. THEN

01:16:52.407 --> 01:16:53.575
LETTING LOCALS DECIDE. IS WHAT'S

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.245
BEST LET'S TAKE FOR SECOND LET'S

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.747
CONSIDER THE OPPOSITION IS

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.015
CORRECT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF

01:17:00.082 --> 01:17:01.950
ARGUMENT AND ASSUMING THAT ALL

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:02.784
OF THESE THINGS COME TO A

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:04.820
CRASHING HALT HAVE WE NOT SPENT

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:10.559
THE LAST TWO YEARS. PREPARING

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.893
PREPARING THE STATE FOR THE

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.095
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE HAVE WE'VE

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.763
DONE NOTHING IN THE PAST TWO

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.698
YEARS ARE WE CAUGHT COMPLETELY

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.300
FLAT FOOTED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:20.302
THE SUGGESTION IS THE GOVERNOR

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:21.837
IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE IN HIS

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.472
SMARTER PRESS CONFERENCE INSURED

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:26.241
CALIFORNIANS THAT WE ARE READY

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.809
AS YOUR FIVE DOES NOT LIMIT THE

01:17:27.876 --> 01:17:29.511
GOVERNOR'S POWER TO ISSUE

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:30.379
EXECUTIVE ORDERS IT JUST

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:32.280
DOESN'T. IF WE BELIEVE THE

01:17:32.347 --> 01:17:33.482
OPPOSITION'S CLAIMS THEY ARE

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.417
INHERENTLY SAYING THAT THE

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.386
LEGISLATURE IS IN. INCAPABLE OF

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:40.455
DOING ITS JOB EDITING CAPABLE OF

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.157
RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES ARE

01:17:42.224 --> 01:17:44.459
GIVING COMMUNITIES THE RESOURCES

01:17:44.526 --> 01:17:45.627
THEY NEED TO ADDRESS CRITICAL

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.729
SITUATIONS. AND I DON'T BELIEVE

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.331
THAT AND I HOPE YOU DON'T EACH

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:51.099
LEGISLATOR IN THE ASSEMBLY AND

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.267
SENATE AGREED AT THE BEGINNING

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.468
OF THIS PANDEMIC TO GRANT THE

01:17:53.535 --> 01:17:55.203
GOVERNOR WITH EMERGENCY POWERS

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.705
TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS AT HAND

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:57.939
BECAUSE IN THE FIRST DAYS OF

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:59.908
COVERED NOBODY KNEW WHAT WE WERE

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:01.610
DEALING WITH. HEALTH EXPERTS

01:18:01.676 --> 01:18:02.711
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND ACROSS

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:03.879
THE WORLD WERE ATTEMPTING TO

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:06.048
DECIPHER THE GENETIC CODE OF

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.716
THIS BUYERS TO DETERMINE HOW IT

01:18:07.783 --> 01:18:09.051
WORKED. WE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.018
ANSWERS THE CHAIRMAN WAS RIGHT

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.187
ABOUT THAT. AND MISTAKES WERE

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:13.288
MADE AND WE LEARN FROM THOSE

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:15.190
MISTAKES. BUT WE ENDED SCHOOL

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.358
YEARS AND WE SHUTTERED

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:17.859
BUSINESSES AND WE IMPLEMENTED

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:19.294
LOCKDOWNS AND REINFORCED REMOTE

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.896
WORK AND WE IMPLEMENTED ALL

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:22.264
SORTS OF POLICIES IN TESTING AND

01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:25.801
NOW AFTER TWO YEARS. OF THIS. WE

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:26.768
HAVE BECOME INCREDIBLY MORE

01:18:26.835 --> 01:18:28.904
AWARE. OF HOW THIS VIRUS SPREADS

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:30.505
AND ITS IMPACTS. AND IT'S

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:32.207

OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE ARE

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:39.181
EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH THIS IN

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:40.515
THIS CONSTANT STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.651

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:45.153

SUCCUMB. TO KEVIN NINETEEN. THE

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.261
SUGGESTION BY SOME OF THE
