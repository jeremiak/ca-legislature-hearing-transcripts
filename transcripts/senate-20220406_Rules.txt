I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY GALLEY FOR THIS APPOINTMENT. AN OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE HEALTH CARE IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT AND I AM EXTREMELY GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANCE TO LEAD A DEPARTMENT THAT PROVIDES THIS RIGHT TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. BY EIGHTEEN YEARS IN STATE GOVERNMENT MOST RECENTLY AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS. AND PRIOR TO ABOUT WORKING ON HEALTH POLICY AS LEGISLATIVE STAFF HAS PROFESSIONALLY PREPARED ME FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. AND PERSONALLY GROWING UP AS A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN MY MOTHER AND FATHER ARE IMMIGRANTS FROM ECUADOR IN ITALY. TAUGHT ME THE VALUES OF HARD WORK RESILIENCE AND PROBLEM SOLVING. THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE SHAPED MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE POWER OF MEDIC HEALTH AS THE ULTIMATE EQUITY TOOL AND A CORNERSTONE OF THE STATE'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. EVERY ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS. TO POSITIVELY IMPACT INDIVIDUALS AND LEAD TO THRIVING COMMUNITIES. BY LIFTING THE EXPERIENCES AND OUTCOMES OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WE ARE LIFTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. FINALLY I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE TO THE DH CS TEAM I'M INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED TO WORK WITH SO MANY DEDICATED PUBLIC SERVANTS AND UNSUNG HEROES WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION. AND WORKED TIRELESSLY TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF CALIFORNIANS. THAT CONCLUDES MY OPENING REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU YOU SO MUCH DIRECTOR- CENTER LAYERED WHAT I GO AHEAD AND LET YOU START US OFF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND MADAM DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR WILLING TO BE WILLING TO MEET WITH ME I REALLY ENJOYED IT. AND I THOUGHT I'D FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT IS TO. THAT EFFECT AND AS THE CHAIR OF EDUCATION WHERE I'VE CALLED OUT ACRONYM ALERTS I BETTER SAY THE ACRONYM FIRST. THERE ARE THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDICS HELP THAT WE ALL KNOW AS CAROLINE. THAT THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST INITIATIVES IN YOUR DEPARTMENT- AND I KNOW WITH% REACHES OUTSIDE INCORPORATES PEOPLE FROM OTHER NON PROFITS AND THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE SYSTEM THE SAME WAY PRIOR TO THESE REFORMS. I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD JUST TALK ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE REFORMS BUT ALSO HOW YOU. INTEND TO MONITOR AND EVALUATE THEIR SUCCESS. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CALLEVA IS REALLY OUR MULTI YEAR INITIATIVE TO TRANSFORM THE WAY WE DELIVER CARE IT MOVES AS TED POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH THAT REALLY PRIORITIZE PREVENTION. WHOLE PERSON CARE AND REALLY EXTEND SUPPORTS AND SERVICES BEYOND HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CARE SETTINGS DIRECTLY INTO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES WE REALLY WANT TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE IN LIFE ADDRESS SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH AND REALLY BREAK DOWN THE WALLS OF HEALTH CARE AND BRING DOWN THOSE SILOS BETWEEN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. I'M I THINK ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES THAT IRAQ THAT WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SPORTS FEATURES OF CALAIS MAINE I WILL SAY THIS MORNING I WAS AT A SEPARATE SACRAMENTO COVERED WHICH IS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IN CALIFORNIA AND SACRAMENTO- AND IT. IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING ARE DESCRIBED WRITING ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND TO HEAR THE EXPERIENCES OF OUR COMMUNITY OF THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS REALLY MEETING INDIVIDUALS WHERE THEY ARE WHETHER IT'S ENCAMPMENTS. OR YOU KNOW IN IN CORNER SHOPS I REALLY HOW THE APP PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET IT THEIR ID'S TO GET A PHONE. ESCORT THEM TO. AT A MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND REALLY REALLY ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS THAT INDIVIDUAL HAS IN IN NAVIGATING THIS COMPLEX DELIVERY SYSTEMS. AS PART OF CAL AIM WE ARE REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EVALUATE THE KEY COMPONENTS IN SOME OF THESE PIECES THAT THAT ARE REALLY TESTING THE BOUNDARIES OF HEALTH CARE AND SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF EVALUATIONS ON THESE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS EVALUATIONS ON SOME OF THE OTHER REFORMS THAT ARE PART OF CAL AIMED I MEAN REALLY DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF THESE INITIATIVES. AND HOW DOES THIS HELP YOU DEAL WITH PREVENTION RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF. REIMBURSING PEOPLE FOR THE HEALTH COSTS. AFTER THEY'VE HAD THE INCIDENT. I WANTED TO KEEP THE- OF. ARE POP HEALTH MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND THIS IS REALLY MEANT TO IDENTIFY REALLY UPSTREAM MISSED OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY ADDRESS. THAT THE IMPACTS OF HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW A TRADITIONALLY OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IS MODELED ON- YOU KNOW REACTIONS TO FALLS REACTIONS TO HOSPITALIZATIONS. REACTIONS TO CHRONIC OUTCOMES AND SO WITH THIS POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH REALLY LOOKING AT THE DATA LOOKING AT WHO ARE THE MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND HOW DO WE DEVELOP DEVELOP. INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE UPSTREAM IMPACTS I THINK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONE OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS WE HAVE IS IT'S HOME MODIFICATIONS. AND SO THINKING THROUGH A YOU KNOW A RAIL IN A PERSON'S HOUSE MIGHT PREVENT FUTURE FALLS INTO HOW DO WE GO UPSTREAM TO DESIGN. AN ENVIRONMENT DESIGNED SYSTEMS THAT REALLY ADDRESS OUR OUR INDIVIDUALS NEEDS AND YOU'RE ALSO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER AND IN THE QUESTION. YOU'RE ALSO ENGAGING MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND OTHER STRATEGIES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL. THAT HAS EXISTED AND- OF WHILE YOU JUST MADE THE CASE FOR WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN HELP YOU REACH OUT INTO SOME OF THESE THINGS HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY ENGAGE THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE NONTRADITIONAL OR NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN IN THE SYSTEM TO SORT OF BRING THEM IN. TO HOW YOU'RE MANAGING. I THINK ONE OF THE KEY INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE IS OUR OUR PATHFINDING AND THESE ARE AND IT'S OVER A BILLION DOLLARS I'M REALLY DEDICATED TO BUILDING OUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS BUILDING OUT THE CAPACITY BETWEEN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SOME OF THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. I THINK ABOUT AGAIN SACRAMENTO COVERAGE JUST SO VIVID IN MY MIND GIVEN THIS MORNING'S EXPERIENCE BUT REALLY THEY WENT FROM ABOUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT SIX COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS I'M IN HAS GROWN TO TWENTY SEVEN AND ARE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT USE THESE DOLLARS- IN THE FUTURE TO BUILD OUT EVEN MORE AND HOW TO BECOME A- ACCOUNT THE BROADER. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT CAN CAN SERVER SERVER THAT THE MEDICARE POPULATION SO I THINK STATEWIDE THESE DOLLARS ARE INTENDED TO REALLY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU BECOME A MEDICAL PROVIDER COLLABORATION DOLLARS B. YEAH IN ORDER TO REALLY. MATCH THOSE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THEN CAPACITY DOLLARS REALLY ACTUALLY BUILDING OUT SOME OF THE WORK FORCE BUILDING OUT SOME OF MAYBE EVEN THE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. IT REALLY SUPPORT THESE PROVIDERS AS THEY BECOME REALLY CRITICAL PARTNERS IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THEN WHEN THE- AND THE LAST QUESTION A HUNDRED MILLION ASKING THIS. IS BY THE NUMBERS I HAVE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE UPDATED IS THAT YOU'RE CARRYING A 14% VACANCY RATE IN THE DEPARTMENT. A. N. HOPEFULLY SOME OF THAT IS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND YOU COULD RECOVER BUT POWER YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS AMBITIOUS REFORM ALL CARRYING A VACANCY RATE OF THAT DISCUSSION YESTERDAY WITH SENIOR STAFF ON THAT POINT AND WE'RE THINKING THROUGH AT OTHER ARE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY WEEK STATEWIDE TO KIND OF FIND ITS STATE WORKFORCE THAT IS MAYBE NOT TRADITIONALLY BEEN PART OF THE DH YES PORTFOLIO AND HOW WE CAN REALLY ADVERTISE AND RECRUIT FROM MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS I THINK. I REALLY AT THE PANDEMIC HAS TAUGHT US THAT WE ARE KIND OF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELEWORK WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD TEAMS VIRTUALLY AND I REALLY THINKING THROUGH STRATEGIES ON HOW TO DO THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THE A YOU ALLOWING ME TO WALK THROUGH THESE IT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL I. LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED SENATOR COM L'ARBRE. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND- THANK I WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU DIRECTOR BASS I KNOW WE WERE NOT ABLE TO- MEET IN PERSON BUT I. HAVE HEARD WELL WE'VE MET BEFORE AND I HAVE TO SAY- BRETT FELDMAN- WITH- THE DIRECTOR STREET MEDICINE AT USC- AND A CONSTITUENT. HAS BEEN RAVING ABOUT YOU AND SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT BECAUSE IT IS NICE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW. LAST YEAR I CURATE AB THREE SIX NINE WHICH WAS A STREET MADISONVILLE AND IT WAS VETOED BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT EIGHT SPARKED A CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE ABOUT HOW WE WORK TO- MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S ALSO BEEN INTEGRATED INTO- THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I DO KNOW THAT- DOUG DR FELDMAN- AS PART OF THE AD HOC GROUP THAT HAS BEEN CONVENE ALSO AS A RESULT- AND THAT YOU'VE HAD- THERE'S A GROUP CONSISTING OF FOUR HEALTH PLANS AND FOURTH STREET MEDICINE. ORGANIZATIONS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AND I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF POSITIVE FEEDBACK- IS COMING FROM THOSE MEETINGS AND SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR TAKING THIS ON- I GUESS DO YOU ALSO PLAN ON ISSUING AND ALL PLAN LETTER TO ALLOW EIMBURSEMENTS TO OCCUR. WHICH HAS BEEN THE THING AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE. THAT- DR FELDMAN SAID. YOU KNOW HE HAS BEEN PROVIDING STREET MEDICINE FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HE HAS COBBLED TOGETHER MONEY FROM NONPROFIT FROM GRANT. AND FROM- THE INSTITUTION IT WORKS WITH THE SCHOOL TO GO INTO THE STREETS. TO PROVIDE CARE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE ON HOUSE AND HE HAS NEVER BEEN PAID. AND HE IS NOT ALONE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER PROVIDERS OUT HERE DOING THIS WORK WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN PAID AND THIS IF IT IS TO HAPPEN THROUGH CALTRAIN. WILL ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR. SO I WANNA JUST THANK EVERYONE FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A PAIN IN THE SIDE. TO SPARK THIS KIND OF CONVERSATION- I'M RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE STILL DELAYS WITH CAL AIM. SO WITH ALL OF THAT. AND I AM APPRECIATE DEEPLY HOW YOU HAVE REMAINED ENGAGE WITH THE STAKE HOLDERS AND HAVE REALLY TAKEN THE FEEDBACK AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU WHERE WE ARE AS IT RELATES TO- ST MEDICINE IN MANAGED CARE THAT PARTICULAR SPACE. A CALENDAR. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE QUESTION AND AGREED IT'S REALLY BEEN A GREAT CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU KNOW I THINK OF SOME FRUITFUL DIALOGUE BETWEEN THAT KIND OF THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO I PLANS AND PROVIDERS REALLY RECOGNIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES HERE IT RELEASED THREE MEDICINE PROVIDES IS JUST IS IT IS SO IN A LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH CAL AIM IN TERMS OF REALLY MEDIAN INDIVIDUALS WHERE THEY ARE BECOMING TRUSTED PROVIDERS BECOMING TRUSTED- YOU KNOW- INDIVIDUALS THAT AT THAT OUR ENROLLEES I REALLY. LOOK TO YOU AND KIND OF RECOGNIZE THAT THERE THAT THERE IS- YOU KNOW THERE'S THAT TRUST THEIR TO PROVIDE KIND OF THE PATHWAYS TO CARE WE'VE BEEN MEETING AND WE'RE WE'RE EXPLORING AT FLEXIBILITIES BETWEEN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND OUR PROVIDERS AND CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH WAYS TO STREAMLINE AND REALLY I PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT- THE R. STREET MANAFORT ST MEDICINE PROVIDERS CAN. PROVIDE SERVICES SIMILAR TO I THINK ABOUT THE WAY THE OBGYN- SERVE OUR INDIVIDUALS TODAY IS REALLY VERY STREAMLINED PROCESS NOT HAVING TO GO THROUGH PRIMARY CARE AT POINT OF CONTACT IN REALLY HAVING THE ABILITY TO REALLY KIND OF WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE PLAN SO THAT- THIS IS A STREAMLINED AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- ANOTHER IMPORTANT BENEFIT OF THAT I AM HAPPY TO KNOW IS BEING RECOGNIZED. IS DOING SERVICES- AND I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE LIST OF PREVENTATIVE SERVICES THAT ARE COVERED UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SO THEY PROVIDE- CRITICAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS TO ENGAGE IN A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM AND I THINK THAT DILUTES SERVICES ARE CRITICAL FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE MISTRUST- WITH THE BIRTHING MEDICAL INDUSTRY- AND I APPRECIATE IN YOUR RESPONSES THAT YOU ALSO UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT A ROLE DOULAS PLAY AND HOW WE DELIVER CARE. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ENSURE THAT HOSPITALS AND SOCIAL SERVICES UNDERSTAND. I THINK AT. MATERNITY CARE IS ONE OF OUR AS THREE TOP- COVERAGE OF QUALITY STRATEGY METRIC AND GOALS AND SO REALLY ORGANIZING OUR ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON THOSE THOSE THREE IT SO ITS MATERNITY CAROL TO SEE THE THREE THE MATERNITY CARE THOUSAND PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND BAD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION SO WE'VE REALLY KIND OF I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR WHAT OUR PLANS ARE PROVIDERS THAT WE WANT TO SEE I'M VAST IMPROVEMENTS IN THOSE CRITICAL AREAS WE HAVE A- GOALS SEPT FIFTY BY TWENTY FIVE WHERE WE WANT. I'M CERTAIN PERCENTAGE INCREASES IN SOME OF THESE METRICS RELATED TO THOSE CLINICAL. THE GOAL GOALS AND SO REALLY ORGANIZING OUR ENTIRE ENTIRE DELIVERY SYSTEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF KIND OF HOW WE CAN MOVE THE MARK THERE AND I WILL ALSO SAY YOU KNOW THE WORK FORCE IS CLEARLY. AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE- SECTOR AND I THINK AS WE THINK THROUGH NEW OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS JEWELERS WE CAN RECOGNIZE THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO DRIVE DOWN SOME OF THESE COSTS TO BE PARTNERS. WITH SOME OF OUR OUR TRADITIONAL HEALTH HEALTH CARE- PROVIDERS SO THAT WE CAN REALLY MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY TO TOUCH THE LIVES OF OUR MEDICARE ENROLLEES. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT MY- MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU IS. BECAUSE YOU YOU YOU TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH A COUPLE OF TIMES. AND WE KNOW THAT- EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTORS ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE OVERWHELMED BY THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE COMING IN AFTER TRYING TO HARM THEMSELVES- THERE'S BEEN A 51% INCREASE IN SUICIDAL ATTEMPTS BY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HANDS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ACROSS ETHNICITIES- GENDER ORIENTATION I MEAN THIS IS REAL THIS IS SO REAL. AND SO WHAT IS THE OVERALL PLAN TO COMBAT. THIS OVERWHELMING INCREASE IN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH ISSUES. BEYOND MONEY WHAT'S OUR STRATEGY. I THINK SOME OF THE WORK WE HAVE UNDERWAY AND REALLY HAVE DEPLOYED TO DATE IS SOME OF THAT THE CAL WORK BEHAVIORAL HEALTH POLICIES WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN NOW RISKY BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES WITHOUT A DIAGNOSIS DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD WE'VE ALSO SIMPLIFIED THE CRITERIA FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THAT CHILDREN EXPERIENCING A SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA SUCH AS HOMELESSNESS HOT WATER SYSTEM INVOLVEMENT OR JUVENILE JUSTICE- INVOLVEMENT HAVE ARE AUTOMATICALLY ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE ALSO CREATED A NO WRONG DOOR POLICY TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS DO NOT NEED TO DISRUPT ANY OF THEIR TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT ONE SYSTEMS THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEM FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM ENSURE THAT THEY GET CARE SOON AS THE AS IT REALLY IS AS THEY PRESENT- I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE'VE KIND OF THAT DEPLOYED RECENTLY IN THE FALL WE AWARDED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO FIFTY ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES AT. EIGHT FIVE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN SKEWS ME- MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE TEAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO REALLY RECOGNIZING THAT SOME OP ED THAT WE WANTED TO BUILD OUT OUR RESPONSE CAPABILITIES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THOSE DOLLARS WERE AWARDED IN THE TRUTH THAT TOOK TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET SO REALLY GOT THOSE DOLLARS OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND THEN IN TERMS OF OUR FUTURE KIND OF. OUR FUTURE WORK IN WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW IN TERMS OF PLANNING AND PREPARING FOR IS THE CHILDREN NEED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WE WILL BE LAUNCHING A VIRTUAL SERVICES AND AECOM PLATFORM REALLY TO ENGAGE UPSTREAM WITH WITH CHILDREN AND YOUTH I'M- BE A RESOURCE FOR THE OUR MOTION ALL AND SOCIAL HEALTH AND- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONVENING A THINK TANK TO REALLY THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN DEPLOY AND BUILD OUT THIS PLATFORM. YEAH ADDITIONAL DOLLARS RELATED. TO BUILDING. IN OUR OUR- CARE HEALTH. AND REALLY I JUST DOLLARS IN TERMS CAPACITY BETWEEN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. AND THEN- I WOULD FINALLY ALSO NOTE WE ARE HAVE SOME AND SOME DOLLARS THAT WE ARE AT WILL BE ISSUING REGARDING EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES REALLY STATEWIDE WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE. COMMUNITIES DEVELOPED PROGRAM SOME OF THOSE REALLY REALLY ARE RESPONSIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO SCALE STATEWIDE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT THE CONCERNS AND NEEDS OF OUR YOUTH. AND THEN FINALLY IS PARTY PUTTING YOU FOR HER HELP INITIATIVE WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION RELATED TO BUILDING OUT THE CONTINUE MUCH INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER IT BE WELLNESS CENTERS. IF YOU YOU KNOW MORE RESIDENTIAL TYPE SETTINGS THOSE DOLLARS WE WILL BE RELEASING OUR PEOPLE ARE THE RK FOR THOSE DOLLARS I'M COME EARLY JACK GEODE AND SO REALLY WANTING RECOGNIZING WE NEED TO BUILD OUT THIS CONTINUUM AND REALLY ATTRIBUTING. SOME RESOURCES TO DO SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT- REALLY INFORMED RESPONSE I HAVE TO TELL YOU I HAVE GOTTEN MORE INVOLVED IN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THAN I CARE TO FOR OF A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO. I HAVE BEEN SPENDING MUCH MORE TIME WITH JEWELERS IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THIS KIND OF WORK. AND OBVIOUSLY I MEAN STREET MEDICINE I JUST GIVEN THE DISTRICT AYE MAN AND WHAT IS UPON US AS A STATE I BELIEVE THESE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES. I APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT HAS SPENT WITH MY OFFICE ON THESE ISSUES. I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO SAY IT AGAIN AND MY COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FEEL LIKE THEY FACE UNDUE BURDENS AND TRYING TO BECOME. MEDICARE PROVIDERS I HAVE HEARD THAT IN THE SPACES THAT I HAVE REFERENCED IN MY QUESTIONS- IT SO I JUST ASK THAT YOU. CONTINUE TO FIND A WAY TO BREAK. PROVIDERS IT IS TRUSTED PARTNERS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS RELY ON I BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN- I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR APPOINTMENT CONFIRMATION TODAY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. BUT JUST FOR THE RECORD I'M ASKING THAT YOU ALL WORK TO COME FIND A WAY TO MAKE THIS WORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CAMARGO SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM. A GOOD AFTERNOON HOW ARE YOU. IT SO I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT AND WERE BROUGHT FORTH BY MY COLLEAGUE AND I EVEN GAVE A VERY VERY INFORMED RESPONSE EVERYTHING CAL AIM THAT I HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS REGARDING CALLIE MYTH THAT'S OKAY. SO I GUESS I'M HOW DOES DHS PLAN TO WORK WITH THE LOCAL AGENCY PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ENSURE A SUCCESSFUL ROLLOUT OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF CALLIN I DON'T THINK THAT. THE COORDINATION PIECE WAS MENTIONED IN YOUR RESPONSE I'D LIKE A RESPONSE TO THAT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. NO DEFINITELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK. AGAIN HELLO I'M IS REALLY BREAKING DOWN THE WALLS OF HEALTH CARE IN THE SILOS OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND YOUR POINT WE NEED TO BUILD THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOME OF THESE NEW PROVIDERS OR NEW. ORGANIZATION THAT WE WANT TO ENGAGE IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AND SO THOSE POP DOLLARS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER I'M REALLY AREN'T OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS TO THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO BRING THEM INTO THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. WE HAVE OVER A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WILL- START REALLY SEEN- COME THIS SUMMER REALLY TOOK TO IT. I KIND OF PUT A AND M. THREE BIG BUCKETS REALLY THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON HOW DO YOU BECOME A MEDICAL PROVIDER HOW DO YOU ENGAGE AND KIND OF BUILD. BUILD OUT YOUR YOUR- YOUR A CAPACITY. I THAN COLLABORATION DOLLARS REALLY HOW DO WE BUILD OUT THE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THESE ORGANIZATIONS OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OF LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS DIFFERENT COUNTY DEPARTMENTS- HOUSING AND HOMELESS- ENTITIES. HOW DO WE BUILD OUT THOSE COLLABORATION DOLLARS ARE INTENDED TO REALLY. BUILD AND BRIDGE THOSE- PARTNERSHIPS TO REALLY THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS AND REALLY I'M- KIND OF LOOK AT A PERSON A COMPREHENSIVELY. AND THEN WE HAVE CAPACITY DOLLARS. THERE'S ACTUALLY INTENDED TO BUILD OUT CAPACITY WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW DOLLARS THAT MIGHT ADD SUPPORT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OR SUPPORT WORKFORCE ON DAHLE ONBOARDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. DOLLARS TO SUPPORT IT PURCHASES ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE NECESSARY SUPPORTS TO REALLY BUILD UP THIS PROVIDER NETWORKAND- INSURE THIS COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS AND OUR PROVIDERS. THANK YOU THINK YOU MEMBER IMAGE I OFTEN SAY IN THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES THAT WERE SHAPED BY THE ENVIRONMENT OR WHAT ARE. AND YOU KNOW OUR LIVES WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE LIVE IN WE'RE SHAPED BY OUR OWN EXPERIENCES. IN SO. OF BEING A BUSINESS OWNER WHEN WE SET OUT NEW PLANS IN- OF THE BUSINESS. WE WANT TO TABLE GOALS OR- MEASURABLE GOALS AND SO. IN THAT ASPECT WITH CITIES WHICH DH CS PLAN TO MONITOR EVALUATE THE SIX SUCCESS OR MEASURABLE GOALS OF AND- OF THE AIMED KILLING HIM PLAN. THAT WE WILL BE COLLECTING REALLY ROBUST INFORMATION REGARDING ENCOUNTER DATA- IN TERMS OF. WHAT SERVICES ARE BEING AS THE PROVIDER SUPPORTED I HOW THESE SERVICES ARE BEING AND- YOU KNOW YOU I DON'T THINK THEY'RE HOW WE WILL STRATIFY THE INFORMATION TO KNOW IF DIFFERENT POPULATIONS ARE RECEIVING CERTAIN SERVICES IN OTHER POPULATIONS ARE RECEIVING OTHER SERVICES. HOW WE THINK THROUGH WHERE ARE STATEWIDE PRESENCE WITH OUR OUR ROLL OUT OF TELLING HIM I'M AND THEN I THINK ALSO REALLY TO POINT OUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS IS A PART OF A DEMONSTRATION PART A PART OF THIS IS. YOU KNOW THROUGH WAIVERS AND SO WE WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH A ROBUST EVALUATION I'M HOW WE ARE DELIVERING ON THE CALENDAR DIRECTIVES AND HOW WE PLAN TO KIND OF. CONTINUE THE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROCESS AS AS WE WORK THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE. OVER THE OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. THANK YOU MA'AM FOR THAT RESPONSE I APPRECIATE THAT. THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE TO- ACTUALLY IF TO MAURY APOLOGIZE BUT THAT THE SECOND TO THE LAST QUESTION IS. WHAT ARE THE TRADE OFFS IF THE ANNIE LIKE WHAT ARE THE TRADEOFFS OF ENTERING NTO A SEPARATE STATE WIDE CONTRACT WITH KAISER PERMANENT TAKE. RATHER THAN- A RECONFIRM A PER CLAIM PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING A DIFFERENT PROCESS OF REALLY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES INTO KAISER. IS THERE A TRADE OFF AND- WITH THIS NEW PLANNER IS IT NEEDING HOW BENEFICIAL WILL BE PRESS. AT WE ARE PROPOSING THAT WE HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL TO ENTER INTO DIRECT CONTRACT WITH KAISER AND WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE KAISER IS A BIT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER OUR OTHER MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY ARE BOTH THE PLAN AND A PROVIDER I'M THEY REALLY BASED ON KIND OF THEIR STRICKEN ORDERS AT A FACILITIES- AND ARE DIFFERENT IN THAT OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS CAN REALLY BUILD OUT THEIR NETWORKS BY CONTRACTING OUT WITH DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN GROUPS ARE PROVIDER OFFICES. HI THERE IS A BIT DIFFERENT- AND SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL REALLY WE ARE GETTING MORE FROM KAISER- IN THE MEDICAL SPACE THAN WHAT WE DO TODAY TODAY KAISER HAS SOME EXEMPTIONS FROM CERTAIN- CERTAIN MANAGED CARE REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS FACILITY SITE REVIEWS MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESSES UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER WOULD BE TREATED NO DIFFERENT FROM OUR OTHER MANAGED CARE PLANS THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW ALL OF THE SAME RULES- AND SO WE WOULD HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT OF THEIR FUNCTIONS I'M TODAY KAISER HAS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDI CAL ENROLLEES- AND THEY ARE IN TWENTY TWO I COUNTIES WE DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH THEM IN FIVE COUNTIES. AND THEN WORK THROUGH- THAT KIND OF A PRIVATE PLAN SAYS DELEGATE PLAN IN IN THE UPPER COUNTIES UNDER THIS PROPOSAL HIGHS ARE WILL BE- IN THIRTY TWO COUNTIES SO ANY PLACE THAT THEY HAVE A COMMERCIAL LINE OF BUSINESS THEY WOULD ALSO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THE IN THE MEDICAL SPACE. UNDER IS. HIGHS ARE ENROLLMENT IS REALLY. ON SO OPEN ENDED HAS SIR IT HAD HIGHS ARE AND ALLOW. SIX TO TWELVE MONTHS AND LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE BE USED THEY LOSE. THEIR JOB. THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY DAY'S TIPS MAINTAIN OUR SELECT KAISER AS PART OF. AS A MEDIC CAL IN ROLE THAT PLAN. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL. WE WOULD MAINTAIN THAT CONTINUITY ABOUT FAMILY LINKAGE I'M ABILITY BUT WE ALSO BE AN OPENING ACT AND RULE MEANT YOU DO ELIGIBLES. I MEAN SO IF INDIVIDUAL SELECT KAISER FOR ART THERE MEDICARE'S- PLAN THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN HIGHS ARE FOR THEIR THEIR MEDICAL SPACE OF THESE ARE SOME OF OUR- I'M INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC HEALTH NEEDS SOME OF OUR COMPLEX CASE MANAGEMENT. I'M AT. INDIVIDUALS AND THEN FINALLY A FOSTER CARE. YOU'VE CROSSED COUNTY LINES- AS PLACEMENT CHANGE THINKING THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH TO HAVE TEIR HEALTH INFORMATION TRANSITION WITH THEM AS THEY MOVED ACROSS COUNTY LINES. SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE NOT UNIONIZED TWICE OR THEY THAT THE PROVIDER KNOWS THAT THAT THAT THE CHILD IS ALLERGIC TO CERTAIN. MEDICATIONS ARE REALLY THINKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE POLICY QUESTIONS ON HOW. A KAISER SPOKESMAN IN THE STATE COULD REALLY BENEFIT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM. I ALSO AND AS AS A RESULT OF SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE PROPOSAL. REALLY THINKING THROUGH OPPORTUNITIES TO DIVERSIFY THE MIX OF ENROLLEES OF MEDIC HOW- PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AND SO. I THROUGH THE DEFAULT ENROLLMENT PROCESS ALSO WORKING THROUGH AN AD THE ABILITY TO ASSIGN A RANDOM MIX OF MEDIC HOW- INDIVIDUALS THAT THE CASE MIX OF KAISER. IS VERY SIMILAR TO OUR CASE MIX OF OTHER MEDICAMENT LANDS. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK ONE THING TO NOTE IS- UNDER THIS PROPOSAL KAISER IS COMMITTED PROVIDING IN PERSON SPECIALLY CARE ACCESS IN SOME OF OUR- AREAS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE I WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE SPECIALLY CARE ACCESS NEEDS WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH KAISER COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND- I'M OUR COMMUNITIES ARE WITH REGARD TO THE LOCATION AND WHAT TYPES OF SPECIALTIES. BUT REALLY. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE GETTING HIGHS ARE TO PARTICIPATE AND MEDICARE MORE THAN TODAY WE'RE GETTING THEM TO WORK ON WITH NINE KAISER MEMBERS IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE WORK WITH OUR AND OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND SPECIALLY CARE ACCESS. I'M AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT BENEFICIAL- A PROPOSAL FOR THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. IN OUR MEDICAL BENEFICIARIES. THANK VERY MUCH FOR THE I. THAT RISK. I'M DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA THE CAMPAIGN. OR THE- OF MEDICARE I'M- PATIENTS IT WOULD BE SEEN. AT BECAUSE- IS THEIR ESTIMATE OR- ADD DATING SERVE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEDI CAL ENROLLEES WE KNOW THAT- WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I'M WE KNOW THAT OUR OUR ENROLLMENT IN MEDI CAL AS WE START GOING TO RE REDETERMINATION WILL- WILL GO DOWN AND SO LIKELY THAT THAT NUMBER WILL GO DOWN FOR KAISER IS WELL SO. FROM THE START OF THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT IT WOULD BE A REQUIREMENT TO GROW ABOUT 25% SO. TODAY THEIR CAPTAIN ROMAN IN THIS IS REALLY PUSHING MEDIC AT KAISER TO GROW. IN THE MEDICAL SPACE MORE THAN THEY DO TODAY. OKAY WAS GOOD I DIDN'T PLAN ON ASK THAT. BUT BASED ON RESPONSE THANK YOU THE LAST QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. IS GIVEN THE RECENT SIGNIFICANT FINES. AGAINST LA CARE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE- SKEWS ME AND WITH THE EXPERIENCE. WE NOW HAVE ROUGHLY OVER THIRTY YEARS AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME TO DECIDE DH CS AND THE LEGISLATURE CONDUCT A TOP TO BOTTOM REVIEW A BIT. YES MEDICARE MANAGED CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE. INCLUDING THE TWO TIER MODEL OR THE TWO PLAN MODEL. I THINK I'M- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I WOULD POINT TO OUR OUR NEW MANAGED CARE CONTRACT THAT WILL GO LIVE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THIS IS REALLY OUR OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS. WE'VE INSTITUTED AN ADDED MANY NEW REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARD TO MANAGED CARES. ARE OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO BE TRANSPARENT TO BE ACCOUNTABLE. IT REALLY MOVE TOWARDS QUALITY AND EQUITY AS THEY DELIVER THEIR SERVICES. AND SO I THINK UNDER THAT WITH WITH OUR NEW CONTRACTS WE'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE A LOT MORE INSIGHT INTO HOW OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS OPERATE HOW THEY DELEGATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES- THEY DELEGATE THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO YOU. AND WHY THEY'RE DELEGATING THE RESPONSIBILITIES AND WITH THIS INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC I THINK WE WILL ALL HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING FOR HOW OUR PLANS DELIVER THEIR SERVICES. I'M AND REALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD THEM MORE ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS BASS THAT YOU'RE VERY. YOU'RE VERY QUALIFIED AND YOU HAVE A GREAT GRASP OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM SO- IT. APPEARS THAT WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED. FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME ASK THOSE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR GROWTH- AGAIN AS ALWAYS IT'S GREAT TO GO LAST BECAUSE OF PEOPLE HIT A NUMBER OF THE TOPICS THAT ARE RELEVANT AND- CURRENT TODAY INCLUDING.

THE PAST SEVEN YEARS KELLY TO TRUST COUPLED WITH TIME AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS ROLE IS THROUGH THESE EXPERIENCES THAT I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND THE POWER PUBLIC SERVICE OUR JOB IS GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONLY TO LEFT HIGHER THOSE WHO'VE BEEN MARGINALIZED BUT TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE ABLE TO LIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES THIS IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR WORK AT COLLEGES CHEST AND IT'S OUR PURSUIT AND- HEALTHY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL.

I'D LIKE TO THANK MY WIFE TRACY MCCARTHY. MY SONS DECLAN CONNOR MY MOTHER SUZANNE MCCARTY. MY GRANDMOTHER DOROTHY MCCARTY AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY FOR ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME. FROM A VERY YOUNG AGE MY PARENTS INSTILLED IN US THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE VIRTUE OF WORKING TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL. AS A LONG TIME LEGISLATIVE STAFF MEMBER NOW PART OF THE KELLY CHESS TEAM. I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO WORK FOR AND WITH AMAZING PUBLIC SERVICE. I'VE SEEN WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN LEGISLATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERS CHALLENGE US. TO PUSH THE STATUS QUO AND MAKE CHANGES WE NEVER THOUGHT POSSIBLE. WHEN I FIRST STARTED WORKING ON HEALTHCARE POLICY IN THE SENATE WE WERE JUST STARTING TO IMPLEMENT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS WERE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR BASIC LIMITED SCOPE MEDICAL SERVICES. TODAY WE REFORMED OUR HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETS CREATED A THRIVING COVERED CALIFORNIA MARKETPLACE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. WITH EXPANDED FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN YOUNG ADULTS SENIORS AND NOW THIS YEAR WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF MAKING UNDOCUMENTED ALL UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE AMAZING PROGRESS WE'VE MADE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M PROUD TO PLAY EVEN THE SMALLEST PART. I'M HONORED AND EXCITED TO BE PART OF THIS WORK AND TO CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIRMAN I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONVERSATION TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- N. F. TO MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN IF WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GO TO OUR TO MEMBERS THAT MAKE IT PULLED FOR HEALTH COMMITTEE JUST IN CASE- SO. AND WE'RE WORKING ON SOME TECHNOLOGY HERE SO CENTER COME LONGER WHY DON'T I START WITH YOU. SO THAT YOU CAN AND YOU CAN ASK I WOULD ASK YOU TO DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO EITHER THE UNDER SECRETARY OR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF SINCE WE'RE TAKING THEM BOTH AT THE SAME TIME BUT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME POSITION I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THAT SO IF YOU'LL JUST DIRECT THE QUESTION. AND MY COLLEAGUES FOLLOW SUIT I WILL LET YOU GO AHEAD. THANK YU THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH AGAIN I APPRECIATED THAT TIME- THAT WE HAD TOGETHER THE OTHER DAY- AND- YOU KNOW I'M STILL IMPRESSED. I YOU KNOW MR MCCARTHY WHEN YOU WERE TALKING YOU SAID YOU KNOW THAT- GRATEFUL FOR THE PUSH PUSH PUSH TAT COMES FROM. THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE ALSO INVESTED IN THIS JOURNEY THAT YOU ALL ARE ON. AND- YES TO THAT BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY YOU ALL HAVE A HEAVY LIFT WHICH IS TO CHANGE HOW WE DELIVER HEALTH CARE SERVICES- IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SETTINGS. IN A WAY THAT IS. EFFECTIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE. AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY DOES DESERVE THREE PUSHES- I. WOULD LIKE TO ASK THIS OF- MARCO- AND THAT WE I ASK THIS WHEN WE MET. ABOUT THE CARE COURTS- THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORTH THAT IS- I THINK VERY DARING- AN INTERESTING. AND ALSO WILL REQUIRE THE BUY IN FROM COUNTIES- WHO HAVE. SAID AT LEAST IN A COUPLE OF MEETINGS THAT I HAVE HAD- APPLAUD. THE- TEN THE OF THE PROPOSED. AND ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT CAPACITY AND IMPLEMENTATION- AND THE REAL WORK THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW BEHIND THE CURTAIN AND SO WOULD LOVE YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW. YOU ALL ARE WORKING THROUGH THOSE CANDID DISCUSSIONS HOW YOU ARE SUPPORTING COUNTIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY- BUT WANT TO BE PART OF THIS- WOULD LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON SORT OF THAT PROCESS- THE CHALLENGES AND THE OPPORTUNITIES. A CENTER COME LONGER FIRST THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO MEET WITH US AND THANK YOU FOR PUSHING US ON ST MEDICINE AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS SO CONTINUE TO PROCESS THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M CARE COURT IN PARTICULAR WHAT I WILL SAY THERE IS THAT I THINK THAT WE HAVE FAILED THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT I WILL JUST START WITH IS THAT. THIS ISN'T FOR ALL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND THIS ISN'T INTENDED TO BE FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE MENTAL UNLESS BUT RATHER FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEVERE SCHIZOPHRENIC DISORDERS OR PSYCHE AS AT A PARTICULAR SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THAT CATEGORY. AND IT IS GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER HOLISTICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO NOT PLAY HOT POTATO WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE HOLISTIC NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE AND THE WAYS THAT WE ALTERNATELY WRAP OURSELVES AROUND THEM. I TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ON A TRAJECTORY THAT AVOIDS CONSERVATORSHIP AND AVOIDS INCARCERATION BECAUSE IT IS TOO EASY TO GET TO THOSE POINTS AND THEN ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE NECESSARY MENTAL HEALTH CARE WHAT ALSO WILL SAY IS THAT I'M THIS IS A FRAMEWORK. CAN WE PUT OUT A FRAMEWORK WITH THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT OF CONVERSATION WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF WHAT THIS REALLY WILL MEAN ON THE GROUND. TOO OFTEN WE PUT TOGETHER IDEAS IN THEORY HERE IN SACRAMENTO BUT WE TEND TO NOT REALIZE ALL THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ON THE GROUND AND SO WE HAVE PUT OUT A PROPOSAL OR CONCEPT FOR A FRAMEWORK WITH THE IDEA THAT WE ENGAGE IN DEEP AND THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION WITH OUR COUNTY PARTNERS ARE CIVIL RIGHTS PARTNERS OTHERS. IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE COMING DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS A PATH OF ADOPTING. THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE SPENT. NOT ENOUGH TIME. AND KNOWLEDGE IN. HOW POVERTY HOW MENTAL HEALTH HOW ACCESS TO CARE OR LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. HOW THAT TRULY DOES AFFECT NOT JUST INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. AND THE STOP GAP SHOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW THE CRIMINAL COURTS. WE SHOULD BE GOING BACK TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT REAL HOLISTIC. PREVENTATIVE CARE LOOKS LIKE- SO IGUESS I'LL ASK THIS QUESTION OF MINUTES MR MCCARTHY- YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE- JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM REALIGNMENT OF JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. FROM ST COUNTY FROM STATE CUSTODY TO THE COUNTIES THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WAS ESTABLISHED- EFFECTIVE JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW- WHAT'S ATTENTIONS IN THIS SPACE RIGHT HOW WE ADDRESS- THIS POPULATION HOW DO WE RAMP UP WHAT THE OFF RAMPS LOOK LIKE. AND SO JUST WONDERING YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU'RE SUPPORTING COUNTIES THAT MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO CARE FOR SOME OF THESE USED- THAT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE SEEING. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER SO WE ARE AT THAT AGE YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE WITH IN THE OFFICE OF USING COMMITTEE RESTORATION WE HAVE BROUGHT ON JUDGE KATHRYN SERRA FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY TO LEAVE THAT OFFICE IT'S A- REAL WIN FOR THE STATE TO BRING IN SUCH A THOUGHTFUL LEADER. SO SHE HAS STARTED WORKING SHE HAS ACTUALLY MET WITH EVERY SINGLE COUNTY PROBATION OFFICER IN THE STATE. AND SHE AND HER T. SMALL TEAM BECAUSE WE'RE STILL BUILDING OFFICE BUT HER TEAM ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE PLANS THAT EACH COUNTY SUBMITS IN ORDER TO ACCESS GRANT FUNDING- TO CARE FOR THIS REALIGNED POPULATION THAT IS SO VULNERABLE. AND SO PART OF THAT WORK IS THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING FEEDBACK TO THE COUNTIES ON WAYS TO IMPROVE THE PLAN SO THAT THERE REALLY IS A GOOD COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR HOW TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE ISSUES AS THEY COME OUT OF. THE FACILITIES. I'M JUDGE TWO ZERO ALSO WORKING. THE STATE WITH OTHER STATE PARTNERS TO THINK ABOUT THIS- AND IS ALSO- WORKING WITHIN EVEN WITHIN OUR AGENCY TO THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION SO. THE WORK IS JUST GETTING STARTED BUT I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT LEADER WHO'S GOING TO TAKE US THERE. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- I HOPE ALSO INTO YOU KNOW INFUSED IN THAT IS. ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE WE CANNOT ALLOW THESE YOUNG FOLKS TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS- AND THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE BLAME GAME HAPPEN AND IT'S THE COUNTY pAT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S REALLY THE USE RIGHT IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY NEED. I WOULD JUST MY FINAL QUESTION IS- JUST TO THE UNDERSECRETARY AND I KNOW THAT- CAL HHS HAS TWO KEY STRATEGIES. TO SUPPORT- THE COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS IS COLLECTIVE WORK AND ONE OF THE STRATEGIES IS INCREASING THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND VISIBILITY OF THE HOMELESSNESS INVESTMENT. AND JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU BECAUSE WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING. THE HOMELESS POPULATION I MEAN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW STREET MEDICINE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE GIVING IT GRANTS AND CAMMING GRANTS ETCETERA ETCETERA BUT PEOPLE ALSO WANT TO KNOW. THE BANG FOR THE BUCK- AND THE VISIBILITY OF WHAT WE ARE GIVING. OUT TO OUR PARTNERS AND WHAT WE'RE GETTING BACK IN SO JUST FOR ME THE FRAME OF THE WORK THAT YOU DO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU. I THINK THIS IS OUR AND THIS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK HOMELESSNESS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IN OUR FACE ON A DAILY BASIS. I YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STREET AND SEE OUR OWN NEIGHBORS WHO ARE HOMELESS AND STUFF FOR US I THINK THAT THE THING HERE IS THAT WE ARE WE ARE PART OF THIS THE R. SECRETARY CO CHAIRS WITH SECRETARY LUIS. CASTRO TO MEET AS THAT INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AND THE IDEA AROUND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IS REALLY THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING EACH OTHER'S PROGRAMS AND DOLLARS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE TRYING TO SERVE. I TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER AND ENSURING THAT WE HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY AND INSIGHTS ON HOW DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. THERE ISN'T THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S FLEXIBILITY WITH REGARDS TO HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE DELIVERED AT THE LOCAL GROUND BECAUSE WHAT WORKS IN SAN DIEGO MAY NOT ORK IN OAKLAND OR IN FRESNO. AND SO THERE HAS TO BE IN A LOT AYE AYE AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE HAS TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT IN A PRUDENT WAY AND SO WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH OUR- PARTNERS AT THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. TO REALLY ALIGN THE INCENTIVES AND THE METRICS THAT WE- THE- THAT WORK VALUE THEIR- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GENERATE OR JUST AS WE GO SO THAT WE'RE NOT WAITING FIVE YEARS LATER FOR AN EVALUATION. I PARTICULAR GRANT PROGRAM TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT THE DOLLARS ONCE BANNED OR THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WEREN'T REALLY ACHIEVED. AND SO FOR US IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOLDING OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE THINGS THAT WE ARE FINDING. IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HOLDING OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHETHER THAT'S COUNTIES ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE WORKING WITH US ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL IN THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I JUST I JUST WANT TO SAY AND I SHARED A LITTLE BIT OF THIS WITH YOU WHEN WE MET. YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE COME BEFORE US AND THEY'RE SELLING THEMSELVES. AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME BEFORE US. AND THEY BELIEVE WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. AND THEY ARE HONEST ABOUT THE WORK THAT IS IN FRONT OF THEM. AND THEY ARE PREPARED BECAUSE THEY ARE AWARE. AND THAT'S YOU TO I HAVE EXTREME CONFIDENCE IN YOU ALL AND I AM VERY EXCITED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONFIRM YOU BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN YOU AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE WALKING EYES WIDE OPEN INTO THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU AND- SO I JUST I HOPE YOU ACCEPT A COMPLIMENT AND I WE ARE VERY LUCKY. VERY LUCKY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATOR COM AUGUR A SENATOR GROWTH THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEN THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE TODAY I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. VISIT WITH YOU PRIOR TO THIS HEARING BUT I DO REMEMBER YOUR CONFIRMATION- AS UNDERSECRETARY MR MEET. IN TWENTY I WAS TWENTY TWENTY M. AND SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS NOW THAT I SUPPORTED YOUR CONFIRMATION THE PAST AND I'M JUST GOING TO BE HONEST WITH YOU AND SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WHATSOEVER THAT AND YOU KNOW YOUR JOB WELL YOU DO THERE I HAVE NO DOUBT IN THAT AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO PRIORITIZE AND GET WORK DONE AND YOU DO SHOWS THAT QUALITY. SO I HAVE A HUGE CONCERN WHEN OUR STAFF AND ON HAVE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE VALENSI LAB AND YOU CAN'T GET THAT INFORMATION TO OUR STAFF. I BELIEVE IN WHAT MIKE A COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES SAID ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY SOMEONE TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT IT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY WITH THE- LAB- BRANCH LAVISH YOU. SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE FOR YOU MISTER MAGE IS THAT. IT TOOK ROUGHLY NINE MONTHS FOR CD PHP COMPLETE REVIEW THE VINCE BILLION SEALAB- THE BRANCH LAB HOW DO YOU RECONCILE YOUR FOCUS WITH THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS IN MY OPINION IT COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS. IN THE REVIEW AT THE. VALENCIA BRANCH LAB. THE FIRST I OF. YOU ASKING ME THIS QUESTION AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE I MADE MADE MYSELF AVAILABLE TO YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS THE REPUBLICAN STAFF ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. AND HAVE ALSO ANSWERED ALL QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT MY WAY. I ALSO AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH THE VALENCIA LAB I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION AROUND THE VALENCIA LAB IN PARTICULAR. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU AND OTHERS WERE WATCHING TODAY FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT WE DAD AND HOW IT IS THAT WE DID AT. THE FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE WAS A DELAY IN TERMS I HAVE. HAD THEIR THE REVIEW IN THE REPORT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HAVE. A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT WAS INDEPENDENT WE ASKED NOT ONLY OUR OWN INVESTIGATORS TO GO WHEN WE ASKED A THIRD PARTY ACCREDITING BODY TO GO IN. AND WE ASK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO GO IN AND TO REVIEW ALL THREE CAME BACK AND CLEARED THE LABORATORY. I SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND. THE DELAY WASN'T BECAUSE WE WERE HIDING ANYTHING BUT RATHER WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS MULTIPLE LAYERS INDEPENDENT OF OURS. REVIEWING THE LABORATORIES BUSINESS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS RIGHT. THE OTHER THING THAT I WILL SAY SENATOR IS THAT THE GOAL HERE WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARKET AND TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTING. UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC MORE THAN 50% OF THE SPECIMENS COLLECTED AND PROCESSED AT THIS LABORATORY. CAME FROM LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN DISTRICTS FROM ALL OF YOU ARE AT THE DIETS ADDITIONALLY WE WERE ABLE TO RECOUP ALL OF THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND FROM EITHER FEMA OR INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT OF THE TESTING THAT WE DID AT THE LABORATORY AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ALL FOUR SEARCHES ARE FIVE SURGES THAT WE'VE HAD. THIS LABORATORY HAS BEEN THE TOP PERFORMING ONE OF THE TOP PERFORMING VOLUME LABORATORIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE WAS A LOT OF UP AND DOWN WITH REGARDS THIS AT THE VERY BIG.I THINK THAT THERE WAS- A LOT OF MISINFORMATION- IN REGARDS TO WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED AT THE LABORATORY BUT I WILL SAY THIS UNEQUIVOCALLY I AM EXTREMELY PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS ENDEAVOR THERE WAS ONLY THE ABILITY TO DO TWO THOUSAND TAX A DAY TO DAY THERE'S A COMMERCIAL CAPACITY WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY. WAS IT PERFECT ABSOLUTELY NOT COULD WE HAVE DONE A BETTER YES BUT WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. AND OUR GOAL HERE WAS TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES AND WE DID EXACTLY THAT. THANK YOU AND I AND I APOLOGIZE I CUT JUST THE FIRST PART OF IT BUT NOT THE LAST PART YOU SAID IT WAS DISTRICT- IT WAS THE- PLAN WAS DISRUPTED WAS THEIR PURPOSEFUL PLAN TO DISRUPT THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SELLING ME- NO SENATOR HAD APOLOGIZED FOR THE WHOLE PLAN WAS TO DISRUPT THE MARKET TO REDUCE THE COST OF TESTING. ANDMAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS ADDITIONAL PLAYERS THAT CAME INTO THE COMMERCIAL MARKET. IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND TESTING SO WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO THIS PARTICULAR ENDEAVOR WE WENT INTO IT WITH THE IDEA OF THAT. TEST SHOULDN'T BE COSTING TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. I SAID THAT ONLY RICH INDIVIDUALS CURRENT OR AFFLUENT INDIVIDUALS CAN GET ACCESS TO IT BUT THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN COULD HAVE ACCESS TO TESTING. OKAY I APOLOGIZE I JUST DIDN'T CATCH WHAT YOU SAID. BUT IT WAS DISTRICT THE MARKET SO I GOT DISTRICT BUT I WASN'T SURE SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT. AND I DO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT- AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I REALLY DO I JUST THERE WAS THIS INFORMATION IT CAME BACK TO US VIA STAFF AND OUR- CAUCUS STAFF. THAT THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS THERE AND THERE WASN'T A LOT AND BEING DONE. BUT I DO FOR RESPONSE IN. NOW I'M NOT SAYING WE'RE TRYING TO DO YOU DIDN'T DO YOUR JOB BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE. VERY EFFECTIVE AT WHAT YOU DO I MEAN IT'S VERY APPARENT TO ME AS AN EMPLOYER IF I WAS INTERVIEWING FOR A POSITION. THAT YOU ARE SOMEONE THAT WOULD WALK IN HAVE TWENTY ITEMS ON THE SCHEDULE EVERY DAY TAKE THEM IN TASK OF EMERGENCY SHOWED UP EXCITED AND- AND THEY GO RIGHT BACK TO THE IMMEDIATE TASK AT HAND. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT YOU ARE THAT TYPE OF PERSON. I AM SO I DO HAVE LIKE I SAID IT QUESTIONS ON THE LAND SEALAB IN THEN- I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD THE DISTRICT THE MARKET PIECE. AND I APPRECIATE- THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOW RESPONDING WITH TESTING. THAT IS A FOR EVERYBODY THAT EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE INCLUDING MYSELF RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO FIND TESTING IN THE COST OF TESTING WAS EXPENSIVE. AND IT DOES MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND WE WANT. UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS TEST. M. AS WELL. I DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND FOR. THANK YOU SIR ANSWERING QUESTION. AND NEXT. POLICE TO REACH OUT TO ME DIRECTLY NEXT TIME IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR STAFF THEN GET WHAT EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED. I KNOW I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT NURSING HOMES IN YOUR DISTRICT BEFORE. AND SO IF THERE IS AN INSTANCE IN THE FUTURE WHERE YOU FELT LIKE OR YOUR STAFF LIKE I HAVE NOT PROVIDED YOU ARE MY TEAM HASN'T PROVIDED YOU WHAT YOU NEED. YOU CAN REACH ME BY CELL PHONE AT ANY POINT IN TIME AND I WILL MAKE SURE TO. RESPOND TO YOU DIRECTLY. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO. YOU WERE VERY HELPFUL WHEN I WAS AND DEALING WITH AS THE NURSING HOME CRISIS IS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT WORK. AT CODE RELATED SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND MR MCCARTHY THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS- I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY NOT SO MUCH IN THE SENATE BUT IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH THE DD COMMUNITY THE IDEA. THAT DEVELIN TO SAVE THIS ABILITY COMMUNITY. N. M. SELF DETERMINATION IS THE FUTURE SELF DELIVERY FOR PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL. ABILITIES IT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM IS LAGGING C. H. H. ESSAY DUE TO IMPROVE. AS THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION CENTER YES I AGREE THE SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAMS IT'S A REAL SORT OF PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW THE D. D. SYSTEM WORKS. GIVING CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES A LOT MORE DIRECT SAY OVER THE SERVICES THEY GET AND- REALLY GIVING THEM THE DECISION MAKING POWER- FOR THE SERVICES SO. IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT SOMETHING THAT WE SUPPORT AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT- I THINK THE ROLLOUT HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE BECAUSE IT IS A NEW THING FOR. THE REGIONAL CENTERS. IMPLEMENTED AND THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE WITH HOW TO DO IT. AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THE DEPARTMENT AND US. TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THEM AND ALSO PUSH THEM TO ROLL IT OUT. ONE THING THAT ISN'T AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PROGRAM IS HAVING SOMEONE. WHO CAN DO. PERFORM THE FINANCIAL WORK FOR THE CONSUMER THEIR FAMILY AND THAT. THAT'S NOT AN EASY JOB AND I THINK WE- PROBABLY NEED TO FOCUS MORE ON SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO MAKE SURE THOSE PEOPLE ARE IN PLACE. FOR THE CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES REALLY ARE COMFORTABLE. UNDERSTANDING THE CHOICES THEY'RE MAKING AND HOW THEIR THEIR SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDED. BUT I AGREE WITH YOU IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT SERVICE WE WANT TO SUCCEED. I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE ASSEMBLY WHEN THAT BILL WAS COMMITTEE. INDEM YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COMMENTS IN THERE AT THAT WERE BASED ON IN THAT COMMITTEE WHEN I WAS I THE ASSEMBLY LIKE I SAID IS. IS SEVEN. WAS IT WAS A LITTLE DISTURBING BECAUSE IT IT WAS SOMETHING AMENDMENTS CONTINUE TO HAD TO BE TAKEN SO THAT WE COULD HAVE SELF DETERMINATION SO. PARENTS DID HAVE THE RIGHTS. AND TO MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN THAT WERE DEVELOPED REALLY DISABLED. AND SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHY THERE IS A LAG TIME ON THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTS. I REALLY DO THAT- YOU GUYS ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM GETS BACK ON TRACK. AND BECAUSE- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PARENTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO. TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR KIDS WHETHER IT'S- WHAT DIVERSE TO BUY WHAT. IF THEY NEED DIAPERS WHAT- WHAT HEALTH PLAN THEY THINK IS THE BEST FOR THEM IN CONJUNCTION WITH THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH THANK YOU YOU. BOTH AND- AGAIN MISTER UNDER. THAT SECRETARY THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE ON THE VALENSI ELEVEN OFFERING UP TO. YOUR CELL PHONE TO HELP WITH IF WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES AND STAFF HAS COMMENTS ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SIR BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK OU SENATOR GROVE OF MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU I'D LIKE TO DIRECT MY FIRST QUESTION TO YOU- MARKLE IF I'M GOING TO SO I DON'T KNOW IF OF YOUR LAST NAME BUT I THINK WE HAD IT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET PERSON PERSON. A COUPLE YEARS AGO- AND WE SHARED I SHARED WITH YOU THAT MY GRANDSON WAS GOING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IN ARE YOU IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU GAVE ME BUT T&lt;c.cyan&gt; HE'S DOING VERY&lt;/c&gt; WELL HE WAS ON THE DEAN'S LIST YOU KNOW ALL THE TIME BUT HE DIDN'T DIE TAKE UP MY- RECOMMENDATION. THAT YOU SHARED WITH ME TO GO IN AND TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW BEING IN THE GOVERNMENT OF. I MAYBE BECAUSE GRANDMA'S BEEN. IN GOVERNMENT A LONG TIME WHO KNOWS BUT- ANYWAY I'M MY COLLEAGUE- CENTER COM LONGER ACTUALLY- HOUSE THE QUESTION I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND THAT'S THE- CARE. COURT PROPOSAL. WHICH IS SET UP TO ACTUALLY ARE TREATED TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN I HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. CONSORTIUM FOR THE STATE NOT TOO LONG AGO AND THEY WERE CONCERNED. ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA COME THEIR WAY AND I THINK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH. I DO WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE. I DEVELOPED THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER ON THE GOALS THAT ARE PROMISE THERE. I LOOKED AT THE BUDGET- THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING IS ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. OF FOR THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND WHEN I WENT DOWN THAT LIST MARK WILLIAMS. I NOTICED THAT THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENT TRAINING PROGRAM. WAS THE- NOT THE LEAST BIT IT WAS LOW ON THE ON THE- THING AND IT IS REALLY. THOSE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REALLY LACKING. THEY WHEN A PERSON ARRIVES AND EMERGENCY OF THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND- THE TRIAGE THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE REALLY THEY'RE SERVING. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT- IN THIS PROGRAM. SO DO YOU WILL YOU HAVE ANY. OPPORTUNITY THE LETTER TO DO. ON THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE THERE AFTER YOU DO AN ASSESSMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT PARTICULAR AREA. REALLY NEEDS. MORE RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. OF FOLKS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHO ARE REALLY GOING TO BE RUNNING ARC- COUNTY AGENCIES. IN RECEIVING IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. IF YOU WILL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BETTER FIRST IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AND I SO TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE- IS DOING WELL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SO THAT'S WONDERFUL. I WILL JUST TELL YOU YOU'RE CORRECT THAT I THINK THAT WE COULD DO ABSOLUTELY MORE AND I THINK WORKFORCE MORE BROADLY. ACROSS HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT PARTICULARLY IN BABY HAVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT. THAT THAT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL WAS DESIGNED TO BUILD ON TOP OF PRIOR INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR MADE. AND ONE AREA THAT I WILL POINT YOU TO IS OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES WHERE WE HAVE SPECIFIC WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS BEING MADE. TO BUILD UP THE WORK FORCE AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SO THERE IS ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. I BY INCREASING RESIDENCY PROGRAMS BY CREATING PIPELINES THAT ARE PROGRAMSTHAT CHECK TRACKS THAT ARE INTENDED TO BUILD ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND NOT BE DUPLICATIVE SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. IS REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE EXISTING GAPS THAT WE HAVEN'T FUNDED NOW THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE FIND AND AREN'T UP AND GOING I THINK. PART OF IT IS TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE X. RAYED. MAKE IT. PEOPLE IN CHAIRS AND PROVIDING IN THE CAN AND SO PART OF OUR WORK ON CALIFORNIA'S REALLY WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT ADDITIONAL GAPS THERE MIGHT BE IN THE SPACE OUR INTENT WITH THE ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL WAS REALLY TO LOOK AT WHAT ADICIONAL GAPS THAT WE HAVE THAT WE DIDN'T FIND OR DIDN'T HAVE ALREADY IN THE PIPELINE TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE IS HANDS DOWN I AM ISSUE THAT HAS ONLY BEEN- ESCALATED EVEN MORE- THE PANDEMIC IT WAS A CUTE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IN THE BEHAVIOR HOUSE BASED. IT IS PERHAPS EVEN MORE OUT GIVEN THAT ARE UNDER STRESS ANXIETY OUR FROM THE PAST TWO YEARS SO I HEAR YOU 1% SENATOR SOMETHING WE THANK VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO AND CONTINUE TO ENTER AND WORK ON. AS AS WE CONTINUE THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN I SEE A VERY CLOSELY TIED TO THE OPIOID. YOU KNOW PROP I'M TREATED. HEALTH THREE FOR THOSE AND SAW IT'S JUST GETTING BACK SO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TO INTO A AND YOU'RE GOING TO THAT. I HAVE YOU KEEPING ME ON FROM UP TO THE MINUTE I CERTAINLY CAN REACH OUT TO YOU BUT IT IS AN AREA THAT I THINK OF A CRITICAL IN TERMS OF US REALLY ARE DOING WHAT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO END HOMELESSNESS AND WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE ALL WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD REDUCE IT TO ZERO. OUT OF A LOFTY GOAL OF COURSE BUT THE- SUBSTANCE ABUSE SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. SO WITHOUT TO- THEY HAD ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT TOM MY COLLEAGUE- FINISHER ROBERT WAS ASKED ABOUT THE- SELF DETERMINATION PROGRAM AND ARE YOU ANSWER THAT VERY WELL IN IN THE OFFICE SO THAT SAW VERY GOOD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO RAMP THAT. AND IT. IT FINAL DECREE. BECAUSE DURING THE WITHOUT THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON. YOUR NOMINATION HANDOFF IT CERTAINLY WILL BE SUPPORTING. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR US SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU. BOTH FOR YOUR SERVICES IS FASCINATING FOR ME BECAUSE I WAS A CABINET SECRETARY FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I NEVER HAD TO HAVE A DEPUTY SECRETARY UNDERSECRETARY BE SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION SO I THINK. I VERY I THINK IT'S A TRIBUTE TO WHAT A BIG DEAL THEY ARE SO- YOU JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND MAY BE AND NOW THAT IT'S BEEN MENTIONED BY TWO PEOPLE. OF MR MCCARTHY MAYBE I'M GETTING INTO THE WEEDS BUT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE TO SELF DETERMINATION ARE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THE LEGISLATURE GAVE MONEY LAST YEAR. BORN OMBUDSMEN AND FOR THE RECORD THAT'S A SWEDISH WORD SO IT'S NOT. AS THE ONE GUY ON THE COMMITTEE- ON NOT. BEING ON GENDER NEUTRAL BUT THE- ON OMBUDSMAN FOR THE FAMILIES TO ACTUALLY TRY TO NAVIGATE THE PROCESS AND I JUST DIDN'T KNOW OFFICIALS TOO IN THE WEEDS TO KNOW. WHETHER THAT'D BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO WHETHER THERE'S ANY FIRST RESULTS FROM THAT OF. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER THAT THE TRUTH IS I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A CREW THAT- WAS ONE PERSON BUT I WILL FIND OUT AND I'LL GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. THAT'S VERY MUCH AND THEN. WHEN THE DISCUSSION WENT A LITTLE BIT OF HOMELESSNESS AND- LET ME START WITH THE UNDERSECRETARY AND SEE IF THE DEPUTY SECRETARY WANTS TO CHIME IN. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING TO ADDRESS STATEWIDE PROBLEMS FROM SACRAMENTO WHERE IT IS REALLY DIFFERENT AND TO. TAKE A LEAF OUT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD'S OF BOOK WHAT ME ASK A DISTRICT RELATED QUESTION AND THAT IS THAT. YOUR WE SOME CITIES IN MY DISTRICT WITH HOMELESS POPULATIONS. THE ON A PER CAPITA. SORT OF DOLES OUT. MONEY ON A PER CAPITA BASIS OF SOME OF THE CITIES THAT HAVE AN OVERWHELMING IMPACT CAN'T GET IN FRONT OF THE ISSUE. IT ONE YEAR IN SACRAMENTO AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO ADDRESS THINGS TO YOU. DOES THAT COME ACROSS TO YOU IS THAT SOMETHING YOU TRY TO COMPENSATE FOR HOW YOU'D MINISTER THE PROGRAMS. SENATOR THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION FUNDAMENTALLY I THINK ONE PRINCIPLE THAT I OFTEN TELL OUR TEAM IS THAT. WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT OUR POLICY IDEAS IN THEORY BUT THEN WE NEED TO REALLY TEST THEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM IN PRACTICE AND WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT. IT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO GET INTO THE GROUND AND YOUR STAND WHAT ARE STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS REALLY THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IN SACRAMENTO HERE WE MIGHT HAVE THIS NOVEL IDEA AROUND X. Y. NZ BUT THEN WE GET ON THE GROUND AND WE REALIZED. WELL THAT REALLY IN PRACTICE DOESN'T WORK AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO OR WHAT I'M TRYING TO SHOW BY EXAMPLE IS REALLY HOW DO WE GET INTO THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND ONE BEAUTIFUL THING ABOUT THE STATE IS THAT WE ARE BIG AND DIVERSE AND SO PART OF IT IS THAT EACH LOCALITY IS GONNA HAVE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND ONE THING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO STRIVE FOR IS HOW DO YOU GIVE PEOPLE FLEXIBILITY WHILE STILL AT THE SAME TIME. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HOLDING PEOPLE LOOK PAUL AND THAT WE'RE BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT PROCESS FEEDS ON THAT PARTICULAR TOPIC AROUND HOMELESSNESS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING ADMINISTERED BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES IN HOUSING AGENCY WHERE WE COME INTO PLAY HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT. OUR HEALTH BEING PART OF HOUSING HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT WRAPPING AROUND THE SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS AND THE HEALTH PROGRAMS IN A HOLISTIC WAY SO THAT WHEN YOU HOW SOMEONE THAT YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES SO THAT THEY CAN STATE HOUSE OR IF THEY'RE ON THE BRINK OF BECOMING HOMELESS SAYS. THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO SERVE. I'M THEM SO THAT. I'M HOME. AND SO I THINK FOR SERVICE ME. I TO YOUR YOUR DIRECT QUESTION IT'S ALL A- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES AND OUR IDEAS IN SACRAMENTO. I'D GET TRANSLATED INTO PRACTICE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS. BEING WILLING TO TAKE REST AND PART OF THAT IS BEING WILLING TO ITERATE CONSTANTLY. IT'S OKAY IF SOMETHING DOESN'T GO AS WE PLANNED BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO ARE JUST. SO THAT WE CAN CORRECT AND ADDRESS THAT CHALLENGE OR THAT ISSUE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION DOES WHAT I THINK IT IN THE INTEREST OF HAVING A CONVERSATION. A. R. WOULD JUST SORT OF SAY ON THE GROUND. THE MARKET IN THE TOWN WHERE I USED TO BE MAYOR YEARS AGO AND THEY HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE POPULATION COMPARED TO THE URBAN AREAS. THE LARGEST PROGRAM YES THEY DO. OVERNIGHT SHELTER THEY DO FAMILY SHELTER THEIR SHOWERS THE AND THEY HAVE ALL THESE THINGS BUT THEY ALSO HAVE. AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT THERE. THEY HAVE BEDS FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A REHAB PLACE AND NOT GOING TO THE STREET AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL. THEY EVEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME HAD LOCKED. A LOCKED FACILITY FOR THINGS THAT WERE RELATED THERE. THEY HAD ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. ALL THOSE THINGS MIGHT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF YOUR DEPARTMENT EVEN THOUGH. THE SUBJECT OF HOUSING IS OVER AND- OF THE BUSINESS AGENCY HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY COORDINATE FOR THOSE HOLISTIC WRAPAROUND SERVICES SINCE YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE. FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT MIGHT TIED TO THOSE THINGS. THAT FIT IN THAT LARGER CONTINUUM OF SERVICES. BUT I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK I'M GREAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK. FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE BUILD PROGRAMS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE NOT BASED ON. STRUCTURES OF GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T MATTER THAT I THAT I SERVICE IS BEING DELIVERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OR SOCIAL SERVICES OR- PARTNER. SERVICE AND ABOUT AND A MATTER IS. VISUAL FRIEND OF. TOM AT. A B. ALSO THIS AND WE- A MATTER. THEM TO ONE AND HAVE US AROUND THEM TO THE CHALLENGE HERE TO VERY FOR IN ON WITH YOU. IS THE WAY FIND IS OUT OF BOTH THE STATE LEVEL BUT- A THE FEDERAL. IT'S BAY ON. ARE PIECE AND WHAT WE TRYING DO AND DIRECTOR BOSS ALLUDED TO THIS AROUND OUR WORKAROUND CAL AIMS SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM. AND COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSIONS IS REALLY FIGURING OUT WAYS IN WHICH WE BLANDON PARADE DOLLARS IN ORDER FOR US TO SERVE THE INDIVIDUAL. IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY ON THE GROUND SO. FOR US IT'S LESS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HAVE SOMEONE HAS DIABETES OR HIV AND AIDS BUT REALLY WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS AND THEN HOW DO WE WRAP AROUND THEM. IN A MUCH MORE HOLISTIC WAY AND THAT IS HARD THAT IS QUARTER CHANGE BOARD AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE'RE SO ACCUSTOMED. TO DOING THINGS AND BUCKETS AND WE'RE ACCUSTOMED TO SAYING LET US TREAT ACTS AND ARTISTRY WHY RATHER THAN SAYING- HOW DO WE LOOK AT YOU AND IN TOTAL AND A GOOD EXAMPLE HERE IS. YOU CAN PROVIDE SOMEONE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE YOU CAN PROVIDE A CHILD HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID OR COVERED CALIFORNIA THEY MAY GO TO A DOCTOR. THEY MAY GET A PRESCRIPTION FOR AN ANTIBIOTIC BUT IF THAT KID DOESN'T HAVE FOOD ON THE TABLE OR A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. THAT NOT ANTIBIOTIC REALLY DOESN'T DO THEM ANY GOOD AND SO FOR US IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE BRIDGE THE GAPS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES WITHIN OUR OWN ORGANIZATION. AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW DO WE PUSH FUNDING DOWN TO THE LOCAL PARTNERS TO BE MORE HOLISTIC AROUND THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN ONE BIG COMPONENT OF THAT IS OUR WORK. PLAN WHICH DIRECTOR BASS REALLY TALKED ABOUT IN GREAT DEPTH. IN IT AND SINCE WE'RE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IT CALLS TO MIND- I RAN AN AIDS SERVICE AGENCY AT THE HEIGHT OF THE EPIDEMIC. AND I REMEMBER ONE APPLICATION FOR HOUSING WHERE ONE TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR GRANT. AND. THERE WAS AN INCH. OF TYRAEL STATE I HAD FILE THAT WERE ON. BE ARC. IN THAT IS WHAT I HEAR FROM THE NONPROFIT ACROSS MY DISTRICT ON A WHOLE HOST OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THANKS THAT. THAT IT REALLY IMPLIES. THE CAPACITY. IN WHEN I WAS AT RESOURCES WE WOULD HAVE THIS ON LAND CONSERVATION AND SO WE WOULD DO A THING. WHERE WE WOULD EXPECT A ONE PAGE LETTER OF INTENT AND THEN JUDGE. WHETHER THERE WAS A REAL APPLICATION HERE AND THEN TRY TO WORK WITH THEM ON THE CAPACITY TO GET IT DONE SO THEY WEREN'T INITIALLY SCREENED OUT. BY THE BASIS OF THEIR CAPACITY. DO YOU KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING ACROSS THE STATE WITH MAYBE SMALLER ENTITIES THAT. THAT ENGAGE WITH YOUR AGENCY. SENATOR YOU COULDN'T OF SAID I COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON AND I THINK PART OF OUR WORK NEEDS TO BEAND IT CONTINUES TO BE. HOW DO WE KIND OF CREATE ARE THE ABILITY FOR US NOT TO HAVE THE OVERLY CUMBERSOME PROCESS FEES FOR NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE DOING BUSINESS WITH PASSED. TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE WITH US AND I THINK TOO OFTEN WE SCREEN OUT FOLKS OR WE DON'T OUT WE LOOK AT PEOPLE BASED ON EXPERIENCE BUT NOT ON APTITUDES ARE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WILL MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL IN PARTICULAR. OUT ROLE OR RESPONSIBILITY AND SO I WHAT YOU JUST SAID IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ACROSS ALL TWELVE DEPARTMENTS AND FIVE OFFICES WITHIN THE AGENCY. REALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE DELIVER BETTER GOVERNMENT SERVICES IN REAL TIME AND THEN MORE IMPORTANTLY WE CAN ADJUST ACT ROCK MORE RAP. H. R. IN ORDER FOR US TO ADAPT BUT I THINK WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING TOO OFTEN IS THAT WE'RE SO RISK AVERSE. ADD THAT IN IT REALLY STIFLES OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO PUSH THE TEAM ON. IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE REALLY ENGAGE PEOPLE FASTER QUICKER. AND LEARN IN REAL TIME I JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC I MEAN IF ANYTHING WE LEARNED FROM THIS IS THAT COVERED HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT EXCELLENT FOR CHANGING. MY BISECTOR GALLEY SAYS I TOOK ALL THE TIME I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE OUR CALL THAT EXPERIENCE AND APPLY IT IN ALL AREAS OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. K. I. A- I COULD KEEP GOING ON THIS BUT THIS IS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL NO NO WE HAVE. A PEOPLE N THE LINE. FOR SERVICE SERVER SUPPORTING YOU BUT MOREOVER I WOULD FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON EXACTLY SOME OF THESE ISSUES AS WE GO. WE WOULD LOVE THAT SENATOR- THANK YOU- CENTER LAYERED- JUST A QUICK. UPDATE I'M GONNA GO BACK TO OUR VICE CHAIR WHO MEANT TO HAVE A QUESTION FOR- FOR- MR MCCARTHY. AND THEN I HAVE A ONE QUESTION BUT THEN I'M GOING TO TAKE A BREAK BEFORE WE GO SPEAKERS. I AM- OF A CORPORATE. WHO ARE IN THE DEATH OF THIS DISCUSSION WITH THESE TWO APPOINTEES AND- DIRECTOR OF VICE. WE'VE GONE ON FOR QUITE A WHILE AND SO I AM GOING O TAKE A BREAK BEFORE WE GO TO SPEAKERS. ARE AFTER WE CONCLUDE HERE IN JUST A COUPLE MOMENTS SO I WANTED PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE LAY OF THE LAND. MANBIJ STEER VERY QUICKLY MR MCCARTY I DID NOT MEAN TO. OF PASS YOU BY BECAUSE I WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND- MY QUESTION IS VERY QUICK AND IT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ASKED BECAUSE I MISSED THE FIRST PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS ON. ON THE WHOLE CARE ON AGENCY APPOINTMENTS BUT IT'S THE HOSPICE CARE FRAUD. IN THE STATEAUDIT. AND ARE WONDERING IF YOU HAVE FOUR OF THERE ARE ANY IMMEDIATE ACTIONS THE AGENCY IS TAKING OFF. WORK TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. TO STOP THE FRAUD SUCH AS I HEARD THERE MIGHT BE A MORATORIUM ON NEW HOSPICE PROVIDERS- SO THEY CAN REALLY DIG DEEPER INTO. WHETHER THERE'S ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IN POVERTY. SOME OF THE PROBLEM THAT'S- WE A LITTLE OF INTEL. SURE YEAH TO ANSWER THANK YOU THE QUESTION CENTER IS A REALLY IN. ISSUE BECAUSE PEOPLE IN HOSPICE AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE SO VULNERABLE AND SO IF THERE ARE ENTITIES OUT THERE THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE FAMILIES IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO STOP SO YOU ARE CORRECT THERE IS A MORATORIUM IN PLACE THAT WAS PART OF A LEGISLATION PASSED BY SENATOR ALLEN- THERE'S A ONE YEAR MORATORIUM IN PLACE ON LICENSES- TO ALLOW OUR DEPARTMENTS TO GET A HOLD OF THIS ISSUE AND IT CUTS ACROSS MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS SO. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LICENSES THE PROVIDERS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS THAT METCALF- WORK OUR DEPARTMENTS WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHEN THERE IS FRAUD- PART APARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ALSO FALL BECAUSE THEY- PROVIDE SERVICES TO FOLKS IN HOSPICE SO. WE ARE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME ACTIONS THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS CAN TAKE AND ARE TAKING NOW. TO BETTER PARTNER AND TO ADDRESS THE FRAUD WORKING TOGETHER BEEFING UP THEIR SYSTEMS TRAINING THEIR WORKERS AND ALSO WITH. THE PROCESSES FOR REVIEWING FOR REFERRING FRAUD DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M- BERMAN OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS REVIEWING THE REGULATIONS AND WORKING ON UPDATES. IT IS IMPORTANT ALTHOUGH THE OTTERS EXCELLENT REPORT HAD A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS MANY OF WHICH WERE ACTUALLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE STATUTORY CHANGES. TO THE LAWS SURROUNDING HOSPICE LICENSURE AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE ARE VERY EAGER TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES. TO PROTECT THIS VERY VOCAL POPULATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND THAT'S VERY GOOD TO HEAR SO. AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AND I WILL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING ON. YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WELL THANK YOU I THANK YOU BOTH I B. R. ONLY HAVE ONE. QUESTION AND CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I THINK MY- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE CERTAINLY. ARE GONE INTO GREAT DETAIL AND OF COURSE BECAUSE- MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE CRITICAL AND YOU COVER. REALLY IMPORTANT ROLES- THE QUESTION AND IT WAS ASKED RELATED TO ANOTHER PROGRAM BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR ROLES IN THE BREATH OF WHITE- THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT DOES- AS IT RELATES TO THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND WE VERY RECENTLY DID ANOTHER APPOINTMENT. ARE RELATED TO- TO THAT ISSUE AND AN OVERSIGHT OF- AGING ARM. YOU KNOW. IT'S MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE M. BOTH OF YOU WERE ENGAGED IN THAT HAVE FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SPENT. OF FUNDING- RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC TO DEAL WITH SOME ISSUES- AROUND- ISOLATION R. AS WELL AS RELIANCE ON HOME DELIVERED SERVICES DURING A PANDEMIC. A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SHIFTING- IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND CERTAINLY AS IT RELATES TO THE FIVE BOLD GOALS IN THE TWENTY THREE STRATEGIES. AND BY TWENTY THIRTY FOUR FIVE CALIFORNIA OF ALL AGES. HOW ARE WE GOING TO KIND OF BUILD ON THAT PROGRAM AND THEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE AGENCIES THAT YOU'D EVEN HAVE DIRECTION OVER. THAT WILL BE AT TEN DOESN'T UNDER SECRETARY I WILL ASK IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT FIRST AND THEN I'LL GO ABSOLUTELY THE DEPUTY SECRETARY AFTER YOU. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THIS QUESTION I APPRECIATE YOU IN YOUR OFFICE ALSO BEING PART OF A ROUND TABLE DISCUSSION IN SAN DIEGO I WHEN WE WERE BUILDING THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON IN THE SENSE. THIS REALLY IS A WHOLE OF SIX EIGHTY AND IT'S A WHOLE OF AGENCY PLAN AND YOU GOT TO THIS WITNESS OUR NEW DIRECTOR DIRECTOR SUSAN TO MORRIS I WHO CAME BEFORE YOU LAST WEEK WAS LEADING THAT'S- HER JOB TO BE AT. THE TABLE BECAUSE AGING IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT IS JUST FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF BEIJING IT IS A CONVERSATION AROUND CALTRAIN IT'S A CONVERSATION AROUND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IT'S A CONVERSATION AROUND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO. OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE AT EVERY TABLE THE ONE UNDER SAYING THAT THE MASTER PLAN RAGING AS WE MADE THIS COMMITMENT THAT WE WOULD NOT CREATE A PLAN THAT. THAT CAL BACKED. AND A APRIL. WE HAVE OUT IS OUR PERMIT ALSO HAS CALVET. ACTS DEPARTMENT TO MOVE THE NEEDLE I WITH THREE TO THE FIVE. PERCENT YOU ALLUDED TO AND I'M HAVEN'T DONE. TO HOLD THE SIX. TO ME SURE THAT WE'RE TRACK TO THE GO. THAT WE FIGHT IN THE MASS PLAN. FOR AGING FINAL YOU WILL LOSE TO THE- THAT THERE'S LOTS MORE. JUST OUR OWN AGE. AND IF I THIS AFTERNOON SECOND GALLEY WILL BE CAN. A CABINET WORK GROUPS AROUND. ALL THE OTHER SECRETARIES WHETHER IT'S NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS TO CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING TO REALLY TALK ABOUT HOW WE FURTHER INTEGRATE SOME OF THOSE PIECES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE PART OF MOVE. IN THAT NEEDLE THE PARTICULAR MATCH THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED SO WHAT I WILL SAY TO THIS IS THAT THIS IS NOT A LAME DUCK. LAN IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ACTIVELY. OUT USING THERE'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY INITIATIVE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN LAUNCHED ARE IS A DATA DASHBOARD THAT IS REALLY HELPING US MOVE THE NEEDLE. AND THEN THERE'S LOCAL PLAY BOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AS A RESULT TO GALVANIZE LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DO THE SAME THING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPUTY SECRETARY MCCARTY GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I WE JUST HAD ALL ALL ON THIS ISSUE MAYBE DRILL DOWN A LITTLE AND- YOU KNOW ONE AREA THAT IS OF SUCH A PARTICULAR CONCERN IS ARE. HOMELESS AGING POPULATION SO MUCH OF THE STATE THE FASTEST GROWING PART OF OUR ALMOST POPULATION OUR- OUR AGING POPULATION. AND SO DIRECTOR TOMAR SUSPEND SO GOOD AT REACHING OUT AND PARTNERING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN CAL HHS AND OUTSIDE OF OUR AGENCY. TO BRING THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT OUR AGING POPULATION NEEDS AND HOW WE SING SPACE SO. PARTNERING WITH H. CD TO TALK ABOUT- S. S. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS AND HOW THOSE CAN BE. DEVELOPED IN AND THOUGHT ABOUT IN AN AGING FRIENDLY WAY I'M TALKING ABOUT- SOME OF OUR OUR COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOW THAT CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE AGING. WISHES SO IT'S IMPORTANT. DEPARTMENT AGING IS NOT A LARGE APARTMENT BUT THEY CAN LEVERAGE THEIR REAL EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA BY WORKING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND DIRECTOR TOMAR SAYS JUST DONE A TERRIFIC JOB. THANK YOU I ARE APPRECIATE THAT I THINK- AND MAYBE YOU'LL CARRY A MESSAGE BACK TO- I MISS BASS- BECAUSE I THINK I GOT STUCK ON ONE QUESTION ABOUT WHERE'S THE HOUSING. BUT I THINK THE BIGGER THE BIGGER ISSUE WHAT I'M HEARING WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT- ISSUES RELATED TO AGING POWER CHORD CAL AIMED THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS THE CHILD HEALTH INITIATIVE- YOU KNOW I HAVE BEGUN TO HEAR LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BLUEPRINTS MASTER PLAN STRATEGIES GOALS AND THAT'S THE WORK YOU DO THAT'S THE DEEP DIVE THAT EACH DEPARTMENT DOES. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT INTEGRATION IS I KNOW THAT WE DON'T LIKE SILOS BUT THEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CROSS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WITH SPECIFIC. MANDATES WE ALL GET NERVOUS WE WANT YOU TO DO IT BUT WE GET NERVOUS BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T CROSS SILOS VERY WELL- AND SO OF COURSE I WANT EVERY SUCCESS WHEN I HEAR HOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM INTEGRATE ALL OF THE SERVICES THEY NEED WHETHER IT'S BASIC HEALTHCARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- DO WE HAVE THE- AT WORK FORCE ISSUES PEOPLE WHO NEED JOBS. BUT THEN THE WORKFORCE ISSUES OF THOSE THAT NEED TO DO THE JOB I GET A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I JUST WORRY ABOUT HOW WE CONNECT ALL THE DOTS BUT I WILL GO BACK TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE SAID OF WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY WE'VE WE HAVE AD.

THAT'S WHY THE VICE CHAIR IS SO IMPORTANT. TO KEEP ME ON TRACK- SENATOR GROWTH AND PRETEND S. THANK YOU MISS DELLA CREWS FOR MEETING WITH ME THIS MORNING I'M SORRY IT WAS A KIND OF ABRUPT AND SHORTENED JUST HAD DIRECT QUESTIONS AND- AND I DIDN'T- ANTICIPATE TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS REGARDING THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD. TODAY BECAUSE WE HAD DISCUSSED IT THIS MORNING THIS IS THE VICE- THE VICE CHAIR BROUGHT IT UP I GUESS WE SHOULD JUST PUT IT ON THE RECORD. AM I SHARED WITH YOU THIS MORNING THAT I HAD A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS FARMWORKERS MAINLY- THAT REALLY REACHED OUT I MEAN THERE WERE OVER SEVENTY FARMWORKERS THAT REACHED OUT WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE GETTING THIS APPOINTMENT TO THE SEISMIC. COMMISSION SAFETY SEISMIC OR SIX FIVE SIX EIGHT TWO COMMISSION. AT WHEN WE TALK TODAY AT YOU DID ASK THE QUESTION OF RELEVANCE LIKE WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE LRB AND THE GROUND FARMWORKER VOTE AND- FARMWORKERS BALLOTS BEING HELD UP FOR. FIVE YEARS AND ALL OF THAT THAT TOOK PLACE THAT I WAS VERY VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN BECAUSE THEY'RE MY CONSTITUENTS RIGHT THEY WERE THE FARMWORKERS THAT. THAT I REPRESENT. SO IN THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION THERE IS NO RELEVANCE BETWEEN AND THE- AS I EXPRESS TO YOU BEFORE. IT'S THEIR CONCERN ABOUT EQUITY JUSTICE AND AN EQUALITY OF PROVIDE. A BALANCED APPROACH AND THEY FEEL THAT YOU DID NOT PROVIDE A BALANCED APPROACH WITH YOUR ROLE AT THE LRB. AND THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT AND YOU KNOW THE SEISMIC SAFETY OVER PRIVATE PROPERTY OVER HOSPITALS OVER- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE MANDATES THAT THAT B. S. THEY WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BALANCED APPROACH WHEN YOU DEAL WITH ALL SIDES. VERSES WHAT DATE THEY SAW AND FROM THEIR OWN EYES AND WITH THEY'VE CONVEYED IN HEARING AFTER HEARING AFTER HEARING- WITH YOUR POSITION AT THE LRB. REGARDING THE PROSECUTION FM FARMWORKERS AND FARMERS IN THAT SITUATION SO HOW ABOUT WE JUST START THERE IF THAT'S OKAY. ABSOLUTELY IT WAS MY HONOR AND MY PLEASURE TO SERVE AS A GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEE TO THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD. AS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR- APPOINTED BY GOVERNOR BROWN IN HIS SECOND TERM AS GOVERNOR HIS FIRST INCLUDED THE CREATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD AND- WE WERE DIRECTOR AND IN THAT CAPACITY AS HIS APPOINTEES TO. BRING BRING REALITY IN BRING TRIPS TO THE PROMISE OF THE LAW AS IT WAS. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. AND IT WAS IN THAT CAPACITY AS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AND THEN LATER AS A REGIONAL DIRECTOR OF THAT I WAS PROUD TO BRING SOME OF THE- FIRST TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDERS REINSTATING WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN FIRED IN RETALIATION FOR THE UNION. ORGANIZING AND SOME THIRTY YEARS. AND NOT EVER THERE WILL BE AS- BOTH HISTORIC AND STILL CURRENT ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL AREAS- FOR. FOR STATE ACTION BOTH IN NEUTRAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN ONCE A DISCRETIONARY DECISION IS MADE BY THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE TO MOVE TOWARDS PROSECUTION. AND I WILL NOTE THAT IN MY CAPACITY AS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR AS WELL AS AS A REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE SALINAS OFFICE- WE INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED- BOTH SIDES OF THE PROVERBIAL I'LL BOTH EMPLOYERS AS WELL AS UNIONS. I'M THIRD ROW IN CASE WAS HANDLED BY THE AGRICULTURALLY RELATIONS BOARDS BY SELLING OFFICE AND IN MY CAPACITY AS A REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR THE SALINAS OFFICE AND OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. UNDER THAT UNDER THAT GUIDANCE AND LEADERSHIP OF OUR GENERAL COUNSEL SOMETHING ADVISED AGAIN. I DID PARTICIPATE AND IMPORTANT STRATEGIC CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE USE OF OUR DISCRETIONARY POWER TO MOVE TOWARDS PROSECUTION GIVEN. OUR FINDINGS OF. THE FINDINGS OF OUR AND- WITH REGARD TO CHARGES THAT WERE FILED. BY THE UNIONS AS WELL AS BY WORKERS ACT AROUND INDUSTRIES- IT HAS BEEN SEVEN LONG YEARS SINCE I'VE SERVED IN THAT CAPACITY OF THEM CULTURALLY RELATIONS BOARD- AND THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A FINDING OF WRONGDOING OR OF ANY BIAS IN THE COURSE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL'S. INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS OF THAT CASE SO I RESPECT THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD AND TO EXPRESS THEIR THEIR CONCERNS- I AM REMINDED OF THE WORDS OF SUCH CHAVEZ WHO SAYS THAT WE DON'T NEED PERFECT POLITICAL SYSTEMS BUT WHAT WE DO NEED US PERFECT PARTICIPATION. AND I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH PEOPLE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW I HAVE BANNED INSPIRED- TO CONTINUE. ACTIVATING THOSE RIGHTS AND MOVING TO ENSURE THAT THEIR OWN FORCING REPRESENTED. AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY- BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I'M I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS SENATOR WITH REGARD TO THIS CASE- I WOULD NOTE THAT I WAS NOT. THE PROSECUTOR ON THE GROUND CASE AS THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR AND SALINAS OFFICE- AND AGAIN JUST STATE ONCE MORE FOR THE RECORD THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A FINDING OF WRONGDOING OR BIAS. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M LOOKING AT THE DOCUMENTS THAT YOU PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON RULES YOU HIGHLIGHT YOUR WORK I'M SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHLIGHT YOUR WORK IN PROMOTING ADVOCACY. THROUGH LITIGATION. AT THE COW. RULE LEGAL ASSISTANCE LEAVE C. EIGHT C. R. L. A. AND M. CENTER EVERY SENSE- ON A CENTER RACE AND POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS IN THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD. AND YOU HIGHLIGHT THAT AS- AS ADVOCACY THROUGH LITIGATION SO I TAKE THAT AND IF I'M WRONG PLEASE CORRECT ME. THAT YOU ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE PEOPLE BY FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST THEM AGAINST OR FOR. INDIVIDUALS IS HOW I TOOK THAT M. IS THIS THE APPROACH THAT YOU THINK THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION SHOULD BE TAKING AND IS OR IS THAT YOUR INTENT TO BRING THAT TO. THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THE COMMISSION QUESTION- MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES HAVE PROVIDED ME WITH THE FAMILIARITY AND A COMFORT WITH MULTIPLE SKILL SETS WITH REGARDS TO ADVOCACY IN PUBLIC SERVICE I'M SO I HAVE EXPERIENCE REPRESENTING INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS AGAINST PUBLIC AGENCIES AS WELL AS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES NORMA AND IT'S THIS UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THAT YOU KNOW THOSE AGAIN THE PROVERBIAL I'LL THAT I BELIEVE REALLY BRINGS AN IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE TO THE WAYS IN WHICH I COULD ADVISE THE STATE. AROUND WAYS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN FACT AVOIDING LITIGATION AGAINST THE STATE FOR FAILURES TO PROVIDE FOR EXAMPLE LANGUAGE ACCESS AFTER A DISASTER OR EQUITABLE RECOVERY OPPORTUNITIES- AFTER DISASTER- AND IT IS THAT PERSPECTIVE AS AN ADVOCATE IN THOSE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS PRIOR TO MY EXPERIENCE BECOMING A PUBLIC SERVICE PUBLIC SERVANT AND MOVING INTO PUBLIC SERVICE THAT I FEEL PROVIDES AGAIN NOT THAT DEEP FAMILIARITY WITH THE TOOLS THAT ADVOCATES USE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING ACCESS TO THOSE TOOLS AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE RIGHTS UNDER THE LAW. ARE MADE REAL BY ADVOCATES AND BY ADVOCACY- AT AT AT THE SAME TIME HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND AS A PUBLIC SERVANT I THINK HELPS ME TO ENSURE THAT I AM WORKING TO AVOID- EVER NEEDING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE ARE HAVING TO LITIGATE- IN ORDER TO ENSURE. THAT PEOPLE'S RIGHTS ARE RESPECTED AND PROTECTED. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW WE A DIFFERENT OF OPINION ON THIS IS BECAUSE I KNOW. OF TAXPAYER WERE USED IN THIS FIVE YEAR LONG BATTLE ADDED THESE FARMWORKERS JUST. PERSISTENTLY FOUGHT FOR AND I KNOW WITH THEM VOTE WAS FINALLY COUNTED IT WAS- FIVE TO ONE I MEAN IT WAS FIVE FOR EVERY FIVE. VOTES AGAINST WHAT WAS BEING FORCED UPON THEM THERE WAS ONE VOTE IN SUPPORT. SO CURRENTLY THE COMMISSION- THE COMMISSION'S ROLE FOR THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION. IS A ROLL IT'S ADVISORY IS THAT CORRECT IT IS ADVISORY YOU FEEL THAT THE SIZING SEISMIC SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE A LARGER ROLE IN ENFORCEMENT AND LITIGATION EARTHQUAKE BUILDING. AND CODES OR I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT OUT WHAT YOUR INTENT IS BASED ON THE BACKGROUND AND KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE ABOUT AND YOUR PAPERWORK THAT YOU FILLED OUT WITH THE RULES COMMITTEE ABOUT- YOU KNOW TAKING A STANCE. FORD YOU KNOW ACTIVISM THROUGH THROUGH LITIGATION A REPRESENTATION TO THE LOCATION IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHEN YOU GET TO THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION NOR IS IT ONE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE COMMISSION IS INTERESTING ON TAKING NOR IS IT ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE COMMISSION TAKE. I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK IT IS A POWERFUL STAFF THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN TO BRING THE COMMISSION. UNDER CAL- YES AT THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BECAUSE WITHOUT. YOUR SUPPORT AND NOT CENTERING OF EARTHQUAKES WITHIN OUR LARGER. ENVIRONMENT LARGER EMERGENCY RESPONSE BODY I THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO IS BRING THE FULL RANGE OF STATE RESOURCES TO BEAR- BOTH. IN PREPARATION FOR AND MITIGATION OF A POSSIBLE EARTHQUAKE EVENTS BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT- THE FULL RANGE OF STATE OPPORTUNITIES IN OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. IMPORTANT LABOR PROTECTIONS THAT CURRENT FLOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE OFFICE OF CAL STAR ARE ALSO. BROUGHT TO BEAR IN THOSE EFFORTS. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTY AND MULTIPLE DISASTERS. AND IT IS WELL SUPPORTED BY DATA THAT IS NOW COMING OUT NATIONALLY IN THIS DISASTER STRICKEN COMMUNITIES. THAT THERE ARE SPECIFIC WINNERS AND LOSERS AND DURING A DISASTER AND THE DATA IS SHOWING THAT. THE MORE MONEY THE MORE FEDERAL MONEY IN PARTICULAR THAT FLOWS INTO A COMMUNITY- ACTUALLY AN INVERSE. IMPACT ON DEEPENING AND EXACERBATING RACE AND ETHNICITY AND RACIAL INEQUITIES SEVEN EQUITIES AROUND RACE AND ETHNICITY. SO IT I BRING. TO THIS TO THIS EFFORT INSIDE OF THE COMMISSION A PERSPECTIVE AND THE RECOGNITION THAT THERE ARE MANY POPULATIONS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS BEING ONE OF THEM. THAT ARE STRUCTURES IN OUR SYSTEMS HAVE MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE. SIR I PROVISIONS WHETHER IT'S THE- PHONE ABILITY WITH EXPERIENCE INSIDE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS AND OUR SYSTEMS AS A RESULT IN THEIR LANGUAGE. SHARE THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS- THIS COMMUNITY I THINK ALLOWS ME TO ENSURE THAT. BANDOW'S EXPERIENCES NOT PERSPECTIVE ARE ARE SHARED BY THE MULTIPLICITY OF STATE AGENCIES THAT ACTUALLY DO YOU HAVE THAT JURISDICTION AND NOT AUTHORITY OVER ENSURING WORKER PROTECTIONS COMMUNITY SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS AFTER AFTER A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE. SO AGAIN JUST TO BE VERY CLEAR IT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IS- BUT THE COMMISSION IS CONSIDERING IS BECOMING IN ANY WAY. A LITIGATION ARM- TO ENSURE THAT THAT- EXISTING LAWS OR REGULATIONS I THINK YOU MENTIONED BUILDING CODES- ARE BEING ENFORCED BY TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS THAT WE CAN BRING TO BEAR EACH OTHER'S. I SPECIFIC SKIL SETS EXPERTISE AND TO ENSURE THAT THOSE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE UPHELD AND PROTECTED THANK YOU MA'AM. AND IT WAS JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR PREVIOUS BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE THE FARMWORKERS IN THEIR COMMUNITY HAD- AND- WITH HEALER BE AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT. YOUR INTENT AS- A MEMBER OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION TO TAKE THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION IN THAT DIRECTION THAT WAS MY QUESTION. CERTAINLY NOT MY INTENT AND WILL LIKELY NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO AND THE CAPACITY AS A- SOCIAL SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE COMMISSION. WHAT I DO BRING A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAYS IN WHICH MANY OF OUR- MOST. FEDERAL AND STATE STRUCTURES AND SYSTEMS CAN SERVE TO. TO MARGINALIZE AND TWO SQUARED ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES I AM WHO ARE IN DIRE NEED OF THOSE REPORTS AND HOW WE CAN BE MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT DESIGNING. AND TO THOSE MARGINS TO ENSURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF OUR SERVICES AND OUR SUPPORT OUR IMPACT- AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY BALLS OR NEED TO EITHER A REQUEST LITIGATION TO MEDICATE MYSELF. I'M MORE TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OR THE NATURE OF EACH JURISDICTION AND IMPORTANT THE SECOND STATE TO COMMISSION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE AND I REALLY DO WANT TO KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE. AND EVEN DURING THE LITIGATION PIECE OF THE L. R. B. AND YOU MENTIONED IT HERE IN YOUR COMMENTS LANGUAGE ACCESS BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THOSE FARMWORKERS WERE. ONLY SPANISH SPEAKING BUT THERE IS ALWAYS REPRESENTATION THERE WITH MULTIPLE LINGUISTS THERE BECAUSE AMONG COMMUNITY IN THE SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY. AND M. AGAIN FOR YOU MAKING THAT STATEMENT TODAY THAT IS AND- IS ONE GOOD THING THAT I APPLIED YOU ONE AND I THINK THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE HE SAID SOMETHING REALLY POSITIVE. AND BECAUSE I KNOW I CAN MATCH YOU WITH THE ELLERBEE STUFF SO- THANK YOU MA'AM FOR RESPONDING. TO THOSE QUESTIONS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU A SENATOR GROVE. CENTER LAYERED GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN THANK YOU. MR A CRUISE FOR YOUR SERVICE HOME ONE MEME STAND BACK BECAUSE THE QUESTION THAT HAPPENED WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON. ON PAST SERVICE TO FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THE SEISMIC SAFETY COMMISSION AND WHILE YOU ARE OF FILLING A CERTAIN- A SLOT IN THE APPOINTMENT OF PROCESS. HOW DO YOU VIEW THE GLOBAL- RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMISSION WHAT DO YOU THINK- IT NEEDS TO DO NOW AND IS DOING WELL OR ISN'T DOING WELL. THANK YOU CENTER FOR THAT QUESTION- I MOVED AND TO REFER TO YOUR RECENT REPORT THAT WAS DONE AFTER THE RICH BY OUR EARTHQUAKE EVENTS AT THE RIDGECREST EARTHQUAKE EVENT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED AND THAT WAS DONE BY THE COMMISSION AND THEN- WERE MADE YEAH AND THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION UNDERTAKEN TO SEE WHAT WAS. THE RESPONSE LIKE WHAT THINGS WERE ABLE MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THE EVENT. AND THEN WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS EVENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE DOING BETTER IN THE FUTURE. I THINK IT'S THAT KIND OF REALLY DEEP THINKING- THAT ALLOWS FOR THE COMMISSION TO TRULY PLAYED A ROLE IN DEEPENING CALIFORNIA'S RESILIENCE TRAFFIC OFFENSE- I LISTEN TO SOME AMAZING BUNKERS THE OTHER DAY TALK ABOUT RESILIENCE AND HOW. HOW THAT WORD CAN ACTUALLY. NUMBER HOWEVER OR OR ALLOW FOR US TO USE SITE OUTSIDE OF OUR- RESPONSIBILITY TO ACTUALLY BE THERE TO PICK UP THOSE PROGRAMS JUST TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES ARE ARE IN FACT. RECOVERY AFTER THESE EVENTS AND- AND TO ENSURE ALSO THAT WE ARE MORE PREPARED FOR FUTURE EVENTS AND I THINK IT'S THAT IDEA- UNDERSTANDING THAT RESILIENCE ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE CAN JUST PUT ON A COMMUNITY AFTER AN ADVENTIST HAPPENED BUT RESILIENCE IS ACTUALLY BUILT. WHEN WE ARE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT UNDERSTANDING AND HONORING THE SUFFERING THE- FONT CARE. AND VERY CLEARLY ARTICULATING WHAT ARE THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND ONLY THEN ARE WE ABLE TO BUILD THAT RESIDENTS ITSELF. I AM I AM REALLY MOVED BY THE ASSAM WORK PRODUCT OF THE COMMISSION- WITH VERY LITTLE RESOURCES IN THE PAST AND TO BRING THAT KIND OF WORK PRODUCT TO THE STATE- AND I AND I THINK THAT IT SPENDING A VERY IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT- AND STRUCTURAL SHIFTS AT AGAIN HOW THE COMMISSION SECOND SIDE OF. YES MARIN- BECAUSE IN THAT. WAY THAT KIND OF THOUGHTFULNESS AND NOT. AND- I WOULD SAY THAT. ANYONE USE THE WORD POSTMORTEM BECAUSE THAT TO TWO MORE. THIS PARTICULAR SAID. BUT ABILITY TO LOOK BACK. ON TO LEARN. FROM THE EVENTS AND TO LIFT UP THE EXPERIENCES OF THE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES- RICH CREEK BRIDGE WEST. PRESSED EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED IN A VERY LITTLE PART OF CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW THAT. ARE REAL CALIFORNIA FACES. SPECIFIC INSIGNIFICANT AND VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGES ARE BOTH SHOOTING TO BE PREPARED AND TO MITIGATE ANY IMPACTS AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THAT. THEY ARE RECOVERING AND HAVE ACCESS TO THE KINDS OF RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED GIVEN THEIR LOCATION AND THEIR JOB. THAT IS. IT CAN BE KIND OF REMOTE TO AND REMOVED FROM. MANY OF THOSE RESOURCES SO. I'M AT THAT REPORT AND I RECKON. THE POWER OF THAT THINKING. I'M AND THE RECORD THAT THEY ARE SOME VERY CRITICAL ANDPOWERFUL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAPPENED THE INDISPENSABLE TO LOOKING DEEPER AT AROUND. I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE COMMISSION WOULD I'M NOT ONLY NEVER DO AGAIN BACK CONTINUE TO DO BETTER NOW IN THIS LARGER CALLAWAY ASKING. WELL. IF- JUST TO COMMENT AND- SO THE CONVERSE CATEGORY- I HAD THE MISFORTUNE. TO BE HONEST CITY COUNCIL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE OF THE CITY THAT 60% OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE IN THE CORE DOWNTOWN WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE WE HAD REMOVED THE- THE BUILDINGS DOWNTOWN WAS CLOSE FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS THERE WERE A WHOLE HOST. OF ISSUES AND WE HAD SOMEBODY COME TO US TWO YEARS OUT FROM THAT EARTHQUAKE CAN SAY. ARE YOU HAVE BUILDINGS IN THE DOWNTOWN THAT ARE STRUCTURALLY SOUND AGAINST AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE STATE DID A REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE A COMPLETE INSPECTION ON ALL THE BUILDINGS AND THEIR STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY DOWNTOWN. IT TURNED OUT OF A SCHEDULED TO COME TO US THE TUESDAY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE. AND NOT STUDY ACCURATELY PREDICTED. THE PLACES THAT PEOPLE DIED THE PLACES PEOPLE TRAPPED AND THE BUILDINGS THAT WERE DESTROYED. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE LARGER ROLE THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK. IN THE COMMISSION. IT IS ALWAYS NOT A MATTER OF- IF THERE'LL BE ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE BUT WHEN. AND THERE'S A MATTER OF HOW WE WILL BE PREPARED AND I THINK WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME. IS THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS OF PREVIOUS QUAKES LEARN FROM THEM. AND INCORPORATE THAT IN POLICY AND I WAS JUST THINKING WHEN I WORKED HERE. MY GRANDMOTHER EVEN LIVED IN SANTA ROSA FOR THAT EARTHQUAKE THAT HAPPENED WHENEVER IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO IT WAS TRAPPED IN A BEDROOM UNTIL SOMEBODY CAME IN. AND GODART AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN EVERYWHERE SO WILL YOU. HE JUST TO CLOSE THIS YEAR YOU REALLY THINK THAT IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT KIND OF WORK ON THIS COMMISSION AND YES YOU'VE YOU HAVE AN EQUITY LINES BECAUSE OF THE CATEGORY RAN BUT YOU'RE ONE OF FIFTEEN COMMISSIONERS AS THE GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY. FOR EVERYTHING HERE AND YOU'RE READY TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT I WAS HEARING FROM YOU. YES CAPTURE THAT BEAUTIFUL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH US SENATOR TOM WALKER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND I APOLOGIES IF SOME OF MY QUESTIONS- WE'RE ALREADY ANSWERED- BUT I WASN'T TRANSIT WALKING ACROSS THE STREET- SO THANK YOU MISS DELA CRUZ I AM. SORRY THAT YOU AND I WERE NOT ABLE TO- SPEAK BEFOREHAND BUT- X. I'M EXCITED TO HAVE YOU- BEFORE US AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU- NEAR EARTHQUAKES DO NOT GET ALONG I AM A GIRL FROM THE MIDWEST AND SO AND I AM BLIND WITHOUT MY GLASSES AND SO. YOU KNOW I SHAKING EARTH WITHOUT ANY WARNING IS JUST A BAD COMBINATION FOR ME- SO I APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS SPACE. I- HAVE TO ALSO COMMENDED YOU FOR- YOU KNOW SERVING ON THE MANY AND DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH SHE SAID I PRESUME AS A BOARD MEMBER I CAN CERTAINLY SEE FROM YOUR- SELECTION THAT YOU ARE COMMITTED TO COMMUNITY AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO BEEN REFERENCED AND- MANY OF YOUR RESPONSES. AND I TOO WAS ABLE TO READ- THE- LETTER OF OPPOSITION- REGARDING YOUR APPOINTMENT AND I WILL JUST SAY THIS YOU KNOW- YOU CAN'T HAVE HATERS IF YOU DON'T HAVE FANS. SO I HOPE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT- I HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT- EARTHQUAKES AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER ABOUT- TSUNAMIS. AND I TEND TO BE WHEN I HAVE INSOMNIA TURN ON THE TELEVISION AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME I DON'T KNOW WHY THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW KEEPS SHOWING UP- ON LATE NIGHT TV. AND THEN IT CAUSES ME TO THINK ABOUT THE TSUNAMI WARNING SIGNS THAT I SEE WHEN I AM TRAVELLING OUT OF MY DISTRICT GETTING CLOSER TO THE WATER- AND JUST WOULD LOVE TO KNOW FROM YOU WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PROTECT. OUR COASTAL POPULATIONS AGAINST THE THREAT POSED EITHER BY A DISTANT OR NEAR SOURCE TSUNAMI EVENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION- I LOVE LIVING AND NUMBER COUNTY THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS TO IT AND THERE'S ALSO AN AMAZING WELL- OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO LEARN. I'M VERY CRITICALLY AND VERY CAREFULLY ADD WHAT IS WORKING ON OUR COASTLINE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE SAFE. WE AND CINEMA COUNTY ARE ALSO- I WOULD SAY- WE LIVE ON A COAST THAT REMINDS US EVERY DAY OF THE POWER OF MOTHER NATURE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR RESPECTING AND UNDERSTANDING OUR IMPACT ON HUMAN BEINGS I'M SO WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF VERY TRAGIC DEATHS WITH REGARDS TO LARGE SNEAKER WAVES THAT CAN SNEAK UP ON PEOPLE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH OUR COASTLINE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE INCREASING LEVEL- SIGNAGE AND WARNINGS INCREASING PRESENCE ARMS RANGERS AND COAST GUARD- ON OUR COAST I THINK HAS REALLY UPPED THE INTEREST AND THE- UNDERSTANDING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THAT OF THE DANGER BOTH AROUND KIND OF WAVES WHICH WE KNOW WILL INCREASE WITH INTENSITY AS CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASES. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASE BUT ALSO- ALL OF THOSE NOMINEES SIGNS ARE ALL OF OUR CALL SIGN AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT THAT WHAT I SEE IN SONOMA COUNTY AND WHAT I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO AND BRING TO THE COMMISSION IS HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT THOSE THAT INFORMATION IS BEING SHARED WITH ALL OUR WITH OUR PEOPLE THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY. I MOVED FIVE EIGHT THE SIGNAGE BEING IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH I AM ALWAYS LOOKING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING NOT ONLY LANGUAGE ACCESS BUT MEMBERS JUSTICE AND THAT WE ARE BRINGING INFORMATION THAT IS RELEVANT AND ACCESSIBLE. TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T NECESSARILY. WE ENGLISH OR ARE UNDER WHAT'S ON THE SIGN. OR READ SPANISH THAT FOR THE MATTER STAGE IS THAT MUCH OF THE- INITIAL STAGES ARE PROVIDING IMPORTANT PUBLIC SIGNAGE THROUGHOUT OUR UP AND DOWN OUR COAST LINES AS WELL AND PROCESS. AND AND THIS IS THAT IS A ISSUE THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART GIVEN MY HOME COUNTY AND- THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING SURE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE A SECOND CHANCE. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- AD YES BECAUSE- WE YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A SESSION NOT LONG AGO AND- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSERVATION AND CLIMATE AND WE WERE- IT WAS SHARED WITH US THAT NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE DROUGHT BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH FUTURE FLOODS- AND SO A TSUNAMI ACTIVITIES I THINK ARE REALLY REAL. MY SECOND LAST QUESTION- DOES HAVE TO DO WITH- MY FAVORITE MY FAVORITE TOPIC EARTHQUAKES- AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WARNINGS ARE ONE ASPECT OF THE GAME BUT I FEEL LIKE- ANOTHER ASPECT IT SORT OF IS SEISMIC RETROFITTING AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO REALLY- SHORE UP AND STRENGTHEN. OF CIVIC INSERTED INTO STRUCTURE IT'S REALLY INTEGRAL TO HOW WE LIVE AND OPERATE AND I HAVE BEEN. ODDLY ENOUGH HEARING MORE AND MORE FROM FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT. WHO EITHER- RUN A SOCIAL SERVICE NONPROFITS- HOSPITALS. SHELTERS RULES I'M TALKING ABOUT SEISMIC RETROFITTING AND- SORT OF SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED FROM THE STATE MORE GUIDANCE THAT IS NEEDED FROM THE STATE EXTENSIONS- HELP AND- YOU KNOW AS I'M WALKING BACK AND FORTH FROM THIS BUILDING TO- OUR OTHER OFFICE SPACE AND IT'S HOT AND IT'S HOT IN JANUARY WHEN IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HOT WHICH IS MY TRIGGER FOR EARTHQUAKES- I JUST WONDERING HOW CAN YOU. CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU ELEVATE THE ISSUE OF YOU KNOW SORT OF A STATE WIDE TO THE SEISMIC RETROFITTING PLAN OR SOMETHING THAT KIND OF MOVES US CLOSER TO HER BUT I THINK UNDERSTANDING AND ACKNOWLEDGING I THINK HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN. TO SHORE UP SO MANY OF THESE- BUILDINGS AND FACILITIES THAT THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF CONSTITUENTS EITHER NEED- WILL WATCH AS IF THE ACCESS THERE IS A PROBLEM OR GOING IN AND OUT OF EVERY DAY TO WORK FOR TO LIVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO I- WE RECENTLY REVIEWED THAT ONE OF THE COMMISSION- NEWEST PUBLICATIONS WHICH IS AN UPDATE FOR BOTH HOMEOWNERS AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS- AROUND. HOW TO ENSURE- HOW DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND CURRENT STATUS OF YOUR PROPERTY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS IN FACT. EARTHQUAKE RESILIENT EARTHQUAKE READY AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE MORE THAT INFORMATION GETS OUT. THROUGHOUT COMMUNITIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND WHAT TO SEE- WE WERE WE ARE GOING TO GET A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE NEEDS ARE IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. AND SO I AM REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PUBLICATION OF THIS UPDATE IT'S A IT'S A GUIDE THAT IS YOU KNOW. THE TO BE VERY ACCESSIBLE AND READER FRIENDLY AND TWO AND TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP SOME OF THOSE SKILLS THAT MAY NOT YET BE AND ARE LARGER POPULATIONS TO BE ABLE TO GO CHECK OUT WHAT IS YOUR BRACING ON YOUR FOUNDATION LOOKS LIKE. AND- AND ALSO TO DIRECT OUR HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS- TO. TWO PEOPLE WHO CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR THEM WERE TRAINED TO OUR LICENSE TO- HAVE ACCESS TO. AND TO THE RIGHT SKILLSET AND TO THE RIGHT- SET OF TOOLS IN ORDER TO TRULY MAKE THESE PROPERTIES- SAFE AND READY. AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND THE SECOND THAT WE RECOGNIZE AS THE NEED FOR FUNDING TO FACILITATE AND TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION- I WOULD SAY THE OTHER THING IN THIS IS REFLECTING A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SENATOR LAYERED ASKED. ABOUT LOOKING BACKWARDS AT EARLIER EVENTS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN THEIR FRENCH. PRESSED A RECORD WAS THAT DOES. REQUESTS FOR SEISMIC SAFETY OR STRUCTURAL SOUNDNESS TRACKS WERE VOLUNTARY AND NOT MANDATORY IN CERTAIN AREAS. AND I THINK THOSE ARE CALLED INTO QUESTION AND DEFINITELY EQUITY QUESTIONS FOR ME AND SO- WHILE IT MAY NOT BE NECESSARY THE MOST POPULAR THING I DO THINK IN CERTAIN AREAS THERE IS A MANDATORY EQUIREMENT THAT YOU GO GET CHECKED OUT FOR. AFTER STRUCTURAL SOUNDNESS AND I'D LOVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE EXPAND THAT MANDATORY. OF THE INSPECTION AND WEBER SAID A RECOGNITION THAT IF YOU MEET THOSE THOSE MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS IF YOU'RE YOU'RE COMING AND EVEN IF YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING STYLE. THERE IS ACCESS TO FUNDS THAT WILL OPEN UP TO FACILITATE AND ENCOURAGE YOU TO MOVE TOWARDS RECORD RESILIENCE. AND I THINK THAT THE COMMISSION IS VERY CLEAR THAT. AT THOSE FUNDS DO NOT IT GEN AND INSUFFICIENT. WAYS FOR FOLKS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. ANOTHER ADDITIONAL. THREATS AND RISKS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE OWN OF THEIR OWN. THESE. THAT WOULD. AND PRESIDENT CELANESE AT RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A PRESS THAT MAY NOT KNOW- HOW MAY NOT THE WHATEVER ARE THE RIGHT NOW TAKE OUT TO MAKE PLACE IS A THEY THAT THEY RUN FAVOR FOR THEM I'M SORRY THIS IS A AREA THAT I AM AREN'T VERY INTERESTED IN MOVING FOR. FORWARD WITH AND I FEEL. I'M BACK- COLLEAGUES TO SIMILAR INTEREST AND OUT SOME OF THESE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AND- MEETING OUR NEEDS WITH THE RIGHT TOOLS AND WITH THE RIGHT RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT OUR STATE AS A WHOLE IS PROTECTED AND MORE RESILIENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOU TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR COM LOGGER- MAKING SURE MEADOW VICE CHAIR DID YOU WANT TO. FINISH UP. VERY QUICKLY ON. GET MY- THE PRESS HERE I THINK YOU MITHILA CRUISE FOR- WHAT APPEARS TO BE A VERY ROBUST WAY AND ON IF NOT VOLUNTEER WORK WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER NON PROFITS AND THE PUBLIC AGENCIES OVER YOUR CAREER AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION. REGARDING APARTMENT THE TO MAKE THE RULES STAFF AND LET ME BOB GIVE A PREAMBLE TO THAT I AM VERY STRONG ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL CONTROL AND YOU ACTUALLY SAID ARE YOU SUGGESTED THE COMMISSION COULD PUT OUT A BROCHURE TO RENTERS EXPLAINING HOW TO DETERMINE IF THE HOUSE THE RENT IS UP TO CODE AND WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS WOULD BE IF THEY ASK THE COUNTY TO DO AN INSPECTION. AND I'M I'M KIND OF WONDERING WHY WE WOULD WANT THE FIVE MAKE COMMISSION SHOULD BE REACHING BEYOND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OUR CODE ENFORCEMENT AND GOING DIRECTLY TO RANCHERS WITH SOMETHING I THINK COULD BE VERY CONFUSING TO THEM AND ALMOST WITH. THAT THERE COULD BE THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE AGAIN FOR LITIGATION THAT MIGHT HAVE NOT BEEN YOUR PURPOSE BUT. BACK TO BEING A- OFFICIAL IT WILL. OUR CITY AND THE KING LEVEL. THAT COULD CREE REAL. OUT THERE ARE YOU KNOW NOT BECAUSE- SUGGESTING THAT. ARE WHAT THEY ARE RENTING IS WHO POTENTIALLY MIGHT NOT UP TO CODE AND START SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL. AND ADVICE AND THEN DRAFT CODE ENFORCEMENT OUR TO DO WHAT COULD BE A MASSIVE- INVESTIGATION MANY PROPERTIES SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT AND I DON'T WANT TO BE READING IT INCORRECTLY BECAUSE THAT WASN'T IN THE MEETING. YES COULD HAVE BEEN IF SOMETHING DIFFERENT BEDS ARE I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR EXPLANATION ON THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CENTER BATES- ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY APPRECIATED ABOUT THE KIND OF REMAKING OF THE INSIDE OF THE COMMISSION AS THE RECOGNITION. SPECIFIC INTERESTS THAT COME FROM FOLKS WHO ARE SERVING IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND WE HAVE ROBUST REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON THE COMMISSION- AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT I ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE COMMISSION AND IT'S- RECOGNITION THAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE MUCH BROADER THAN. FIFTEEN OF US COMMISSIONERS AND THAT- WE ARE EACH TASKED WITH THE IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES OF BRINGING THINGS HERE ARE YOU ARE STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITIES AND- AND AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT. OFFICIAL I SEE THAT AS BEING HYPOCRITICAL TO MY ROLE I'M IN THE STATE LIKE HI CITY AND SO. I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- MAKING AVAILABLE A PAMPHLET THAT'S DIRECTED TO OUR COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL. PROPERTY OWNERS ARE HOMEOWNERS AROUND HOW THEY COULD KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE- AND A PAMPHLET THAT WOULD ALSO GO TO RENTERS OF THOSE OF THOSE SAME PROPERTIES AND- THAT WOULD CHALLENGE LOCAL CONTROL IN PARTICULAR- I THINK AS YOU KNOW. WE RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF OUR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND BEING ABLE TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE WHAT THEY ARE SEEING. WHAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO ENFORCE THEIR EXISTING RIGHTS ARE BRINGING TO THEM IT IS A REALLY CRITICAL FUNCTION. OF THEIR CAPACITY. AND SO I- I THINK THAT I'M I'M- ADJUSTING AT ALL THAT- M. THAT WOULD BE DIRECT TO RENTERS PLAN AND ANYWAY IN FACT IT WOULD JUST BE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS MORE AND MORE UNDERSTANDING AND COMFORT WITH UNDERSTANDING HOW WE BECOME MORE RESILIENT AS YOU KNOW IN IN EACH OF OUR ROLES IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER YOU ARE A PROPERTY OWNER OR WHETHER YOU ARE VENTURA WHO CAN HELP YOUR- AND- YOUR- YOUR LANDLORD OR YOUR COMMERCIALS AND MORE AND TO FIND THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO KEEP. THEIR PROPERTY SAFE AND AS A RESULT TO KEEP YOUR LIFE SAFE- I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WORKING AS AN AS AN EQUITY ADVOCATE- WE REALLY COME AT THINGS WITH AN ASSET FRAME NOT A DEFICIT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A GREATER AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN THE HANDS OF GREATER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO ACTIVATE PEOPLE'S SKILL SETS AND THERE ARE CONNECTIVITY TO GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. AND THEIR OWN RECOGNITION OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND OUR STATE'S LARGER. EFFORT AND SO. JUST JUST THREE. I AM SUGGEST THAT WE REMOVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER IMPORTANT ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. JUST THAT ANY MORE INFORMATION I THINK IN THE HANDS OF MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY AROUND THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF. PUBLIC SAFETY AND STRUCTURAL SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES I'M IS A GOOD THING. THANK YOU FOR THAT RESPONSE I GUESS WE WILL CONTINUE TO NOT TOTALLY AGREE ON THAT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE. THE SIZE MAKE COMMISSION WOULD ACTUALLY SUPERSEDE THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THEIR ENFORCEMENT ON PROPERTIES THAT ARE NOT UP TO. SNUFF ACCORDING TO WHATEVER. THE REQUIREMENTS ARE IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THOSE DIFFERENT OF FOR LET'S SAY COASTAL PROPERTIES WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF MY DISTRICT. AND THOSE THAT MIGHT BE MORE IN LAND IN TERMS OF THE RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THE NOMINEES ARE FOLLOWING EARTHQUAKES AND WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST WARNING SYSTEM ALONG THE COASTAL PROPERTIES ALREADY. SO I JUST THINK THAT SOMETHING- THAT SUBORDINATES LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO A SEISMIC COMMISSION IN IN PARTICULAR YOUR APPOINTMENT TO THAT WHICH IS AND SOCIAL SERVICES NOT CODE ENFORCEMENT. INSTABILITY OF THE BUILDINGS AND WEBER WITH THE CODE FOR A AND VARIOUS REGIONS IS A LITTLE OVERREACH- BY THE WAY I LOOK AT IT LAST QUESTION. ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE IS FOR TRADITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF FOR THE APPOINTMENT TO THE SOCIAL SERVICE FEET. ON THE SEISMIC COMMISSION AND I ASK YOU THAT BECAUSE ONCE UPON A TIME I WAS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND HAPPENED TO BE THERE DURING A COUPLE AT LEAST ONE OF THE EARTHQUAKES WE HAVE A CASELOAD THAT DEFINE WHERE THOSE ARE VERY LOW INCOME AND VERY VULNERABLE PROPERTIES OLD ONES BY THE WAY. SO IT WOULD BE VERY EASY THROUGH THE SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY IF YOU ARE THE REPRESENTATIVE. IN THE ADOPTION OF WE NEED EDUCATION TO USE THAT AS A VEHICLE BY TWO TO BE RELATING TO THROUGH THE COUNTIES TO THERE ARE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. OF HOW TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THOSE FOLKS THAT ACTUALLY ARE. OUR IN. OUR SOCIAL SERVICES CASELOADS. THANK YOU SENATOR SO- YOUR LAST EVER. THE IT SHOULD HIS. OF THIS POSITION APPOINTMENT- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS FIRST POSSESSION OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES REPRESENTATIVE ON THE COMMISSION IS ACTUALLY A NEW POSITION AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING THE COMMISSION. AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. A TRADITIONAL HISTORICAL ROLE IN THIS CAPACITY I WOULD SAY THAT. AGAIN GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE. IN LOOKING AT OUR PREPAREDNESS AS WELL AS DISASTER IMMEDIATE DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AND OTHER DISASTERS HAS PREPARED ME VERY WELL FOR BEING ABLE TO LUCK WITH A CRITICAL EYE TOWARDS. OUR CURRENT BENEFITS STRUCTURE IS IN PLACE. TO ENSURE EQUITABLE APPARENT NURSES WAS AFFABLE RECOVERY AS I MENTIONED IN MY IN MY COMMENTS EARLIER. AND WE ARE SEEING NATIONAL DATA THAT SHOWS US THAT THERE GREATER NUMBER OF FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT FLOWS INTO A CAMINO. COMMUNITY AFTER A DISASTER ACTUALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS INEQUITIES- IT DEPENDS AND EXACERBATES THEM AND SO I THINK AND MY ROLE AS- THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMISSIONER. AND IN THIS. IN THIS COMMISSION BE TO. A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAYS IN WHICH SOME OF THOSE EXISTING SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES ACTUALLY SERVE TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE. WHO MOST NEED TO BE SERVED AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION AS I HAVE DONE IN PAST DISASTERS- I WAS. VERY VERY HAPPY TO FIND- SOME OLD FRIENDS AND SOME AND SOME NEW FRIENDS AND SIDE OF. AND CDSS DURING THIS THE COUNTY FIRE IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEE ON IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE AVAILABLE AND A NEW AND CREATIVE. FUNDING STREAMS TO ADDRESS A PARTICULAR NEEDS AND SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES THAT WERE ACTUALLY EXCLUDED FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESS FEDERAL- AND OTHER STATE BENEFITS PROGRAMS AND S- IT WOULD BE THAT COMBINATION OF MY- DEEP EXPERIENCE IN DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. AS WELL AS AND MY CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH MANY OF THE STATE INSTITUTIONS- ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING CREATIVE AND RECOGNIZING SOME OF THOSE GAPS. AT WHEN HEARING OF THE FEDERAL AND SOME OF THE GAPS THEN WE KIND OF. CREATE BUYING THEM AND NOT BE MORE CREATIVE RECOGNIZING THAT. THE UNIQUENESS OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT THAT CREATES FOR SO MANY OF US IN PUBLIC SERVICE TO. BE CREATIVE AND HAVE OUR EYES I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT WIDER OPEN TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SEEING AND SERVING EVERYONE WHO NEEDS US. THANK YOU FOR THOSE RESPONSES. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MEADOW VICE CHAIR- I THINK I PROBABLY HAVE A ONE QUESTION AND THEN A COMMENT BEFORE WE GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. I'M JUST GOING TO QUICKLY- ASK IN TERMS OF.

CONFIRM THAT OBVIOUSLY YOUR COMMITMENT IS TO DO THIS AND- I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR THAT ON THE RECORD GIVEN. THE APPOINTMENT. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MADAM CHAIR- THAT'S WHY IS NOT NECESSARILY AN APPOINTMENT THAT I SOUGHT OUT- I RESPONDED TO OUR QUESTION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO CONSIDER THIS APPOINTMENT GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY DURING THE SONOMA COUNTY WILDFIRES AND IT WAS AN HONOR FOR ME TO CONSIDER AND THEN TO MAKE THE DECISION THAT IN FACT THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT. AREA FOR ME TO DEEPEN MY SKILLS AND TO ENSURE THAT I WAS ALSO BRINGING THAT PERSPECTIVE FROM A VERY UNIQUE IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITY AND TO- INTO THE LARGER STATE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE CINEMA COUNTY- DEALS WITH THE THREATS OF TSUNAMIS WE HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM MAJOR EARTHQUAKES AND WE ARE NOW GROUND ZERO FOUR- THESE NEW URBAN WILDFIRES THAT WE WILL SEE INCREASING IN INTENSITY AND SO THAT COMBINATION OF EXPERIENCE AND MY DEEP DEDICATION AND LOVE TO. ALL OF MY COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT I COME FROM THAT I SEE IN THAT I LOVE ON- WITH ALL OF MY HEART AND MAKES IT CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY SOMETHING THAT- HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO BUT THE DESIRE TO DO- I WOULD SAY THAT MY WORK ETHIC IS- IS. IS VERY STRONG AND. COME FROM FAMILIES THAT. THAT HAVE SHOWN. HOW AND HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO DEVELOP. A WORK ETHIC THAT IS STRONG AND POWERFUL THAT ALSO CONNECTS YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT CITING OUT OF IT BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT. FIND YOUR WAY THAT. KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE COOL BUT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT IT IS CONNECTED TO. YOUR HEART'S WORK AND TO WHAT IT IS THAT YOU HAVE THE ABILITY AND CAPACITY TO DO AND THAT IS A DECISION THAT I MADE. WHEN I SAID YES YOUR THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT I HAVE I HAVE IN FACT BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED DIVAN TO EVERY MEETING I HAVE. LEARNED A WHOLE NEW AREA- WHAT CALIFORNIA'S CHALLENGES ARE- AND HOW AND STARTED TO DREAM I'M WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMISSION ABOUT HOW WE CAN MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. IN AN EQUITABLE WAY- IN A WAY THAT ENSURES JUSTICE AND IN A WAY THAT RENT RESPECTS- THE NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES- AND WHAT THEY COULD BRING AS ASSETS. TO THE LARGER STATE EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MORE RESILIENT. AND NOW WE ARE ABLE. TO WITHSTAND THE CHALLENGES THAT OUR FUTURE BRINGS.
