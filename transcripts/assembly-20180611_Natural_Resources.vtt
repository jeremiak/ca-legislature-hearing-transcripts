A REALLY SIGNIFICANT LOCAL AND

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.956 region:rollup2
ASPECT TO THIS THAT CAN ONLY BE

00:33:09.788 --> 00:33:12.824 region:rollup2
DONE THROUGH LOCAL GROUPS LIKE

00:33:10.956 --> 00:33:14.526 region:rollup2

LEVEL.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:19.764 region:rollup2
AND SO WE FEEL LIKE IT'S REALLY

00:33:18.263 --> 00:33:22.334 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF THIS WORK

00:33:19.764 --> 00:33:24.970 region:rollup2
TO REMAIN LOCAL HOWEVER WHEN WE

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:28.006 region:rollup2

I'M HAVING TO IS AS. YOU

REFERENCE BEING ABLE TO AND.

00:33:30.642 --> 00:33:33.144 region:rollup2
A CASH FLOW THE STATE ON THESE

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:35.347 region:rollup2
PROJECTS WE CAN SOMETIMES GO AS

00:33:33.144 --> 00:33:37.215 region:rollup2
MUCH AS I ONE TO TEN MILLION

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:38.917 region:rollup2
DOLLARS I THAT WERE CASH FLOWING

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:39.584 region:rollup2
FOR THE STATE. AND THAT PURSUIT

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:40.352 region:rollup2
CREATES A REALLY SERIOUS

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:42.153 region:rollup2
HARDSHIP.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:43.822 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOCAL CONSERVATION

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:45.190 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IN FOR THE OTHER FOLKS

00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:46.524 region:rollup2
THAT THEY TAKE ON THIS MONEY.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.726 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THE

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:50.161 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION DISTRICTS DO WITH

00:33:47.726 --> 00:33:50.762 region:rollup2
HOW LITTLE MONEY THEY ACTUALLY

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.197 region:rollup2
RECEIVE IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:53.632 region:rollup2
AMAZING TO ME. I YOU KNOW REALLY

00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:55.500 region:rollup2
GREAT EXAMPLE IS THAT WE

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:56.668 region:rollup2
RECENTLY RECEIVED AT THE TAHOE

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.737 region:rollup2
RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT.

00:33:56.668 --> 00:34:01.706 region:rollup2
RECENTLY RECEIVED A FORTY SEVEN

00:33:58.737 --> 00:34:03.642 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A SMALL.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:05.477 region:rollup2
AS STRATEGIC PLANNING GRANT AND

00:34:03.642 --> 00:34:06.845 region:rollup2
TURNED THAT INTO A MULTI MILLION

00:34:05.477 --> 00:34:07.679 region:rollup2
DOLLAR EASEMENTS IN WHICH

00:34:06.845 --> 00:34:09.748 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA DO ALL THE

00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:10.282 region:rollup2
RESTORATION PROJECTS ON JUST

00:34:09.748 --> 00:34:11.983 region:rollup2
THAT FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:14.185 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:15.987 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TYING UP.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.088 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE TO TEN MILLION

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:18.623 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WORTH OF THEIR ASSETS

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:19.658 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS IS THAT.

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:21.259 region:rollup2
THE CONSERVATION DISTRICTS

00:34:19.658 --> 00:34:22.727 region:rollup2
AREN'T ABLE TO DO THE IMPORTANT

00:34:21.259 --> 00:34:24.796 region:rollup2
WORK THAT THEY'RE CHARGED WITH

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:26.064 region:rollup2
DOING NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IF

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:27.432 region:rollup2
THEY DO DO THAT WORK THEY

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:29.100 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES HAVE TO COME UP WITH

00:34:27.432 --> 00:34:30.468 region:rollup2
CREATIVE MEANS OF PAYING FOR IT

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.202 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:33.471 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:33.939 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS IN A TIMELY WAY

00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:34.706 region:rollup2
WHICH THAT HURTS LOCAL

00:34:33.939 --> 00:34:36.541 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:38.910 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY THERE ONLY OTHER

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:40.378 region:rollup2
OPTION IS REALLY TO TAKE ON AND

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.013 region:rollup2
LOANS WHICH THEN RUN THEM

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:43.114 region:rollup2
ANOTHER INTEREST RATE THAT GOES

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:44.115 region:rollup2
ON TOP OF THAT. AND WHEN THEY'RE

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:46.151 region:rollup2
ONLY BEING PAID SOMEWHERE

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:47.886 region:rollup2
BETWEEN TWO PERCENT AND FIFTEEN

00:34:46.151 --> 00:34:49.921 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OVERHEAD YOU OUT OF

00:34:47.886 --> 00:34:51.156 region:rollup2
THREE FOUR FIVE PERCENT LOAN ON

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.357 region:rollup2
TO THAT AND IT MAKES IT ALMOST

00:34:51.156 --> 00:34:55.093 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO GET THE

00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:57.062 region:rollup2
WORK DONE. SO THIS ISSUE IS SO

00:34:55.093 --> 00:34:58.196 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO LOCAL CONSERVATION

00:34:57.062 --> 00:34:59.998 region:rollup2
