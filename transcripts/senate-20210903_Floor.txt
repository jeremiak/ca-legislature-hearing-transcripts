THAT WE EAT. INDIVIDUAL FOOD COMPANIES LIKE MCDONALD'S WENDY'S WHOLE FOODS CHIPOTLE- OTHER STATES LIKE NEW YORK HAVE ALREADY PROACTIVELY BEEN PHASING OUT OR BANNING P. FILES FROM PAPER BASED FOOD PACKAGING IN A RECENT REPORT. FOUND THAT NEARLY 80% OF NONSTICK PANS AND CONTAMINATED. SITE TESTING- THE BIG WE HAVE A COATING IS MADE FROM P. FAST. SO THIS BILL. BANS THE USE OF P. FAST IN PLANT BASED FOOD PACKAGING BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IT REQUIRES COOKWARE MANUFACTURERS TO DISCLOSE THE USE OF P. FIVE ANOTHER CAT HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS FROM THE GSES CANDIDATE CHEMICAL LISTING THEIR PRODUCTS. ONLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THEN ON THE PACKAGING WE TWENTY FOUR IT PROHIBITS MISLEADING MARKETING CLAIMS ON COOKWARE CLAIMED.
