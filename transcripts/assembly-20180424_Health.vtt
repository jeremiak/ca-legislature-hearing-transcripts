01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:39.355 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO NINETY THREE THANK

BUT AND OTHER OTHERS IN

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:44.827 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.029 region:rollup2
SEEING NO MORE BRING IT BACK TO

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:48.631 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR

01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:50.433 region:rollup2
COMMENTS MISTER FLOOR.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:51.768 region:rollup2
AND THE PACIFIC THANK YOU TO THE

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:53.136 region:rollup2
AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS UP

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:54.370 region:rollup2
AROUND. I DO APOLOGIZE I'M HAVE

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:56.439 region:rollup2
TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:59.375 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR BILL. THERE WAS A LOT

01:07:56.439 --> 01:08:00.443 region:rollup2
SAID TODAY ABOUT HELLFIRE IN THE

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.210 region:rollup2
FIRE SERVICE IN.

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
AS YOU MAY KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:02.912 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHERE I COME FROM I

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.647 region:rollup2
WORK FOR CAL FIRE FOR A NUMBER

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.648 region:rollup2
OF YEARS. AND IN THEIR MINIMUM

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.182 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS IT'S EIGHTEEN

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:07.951 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:09.519 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:11.387 region:rollup2
SO THERE IS NO THIS CORRELATION

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:12.989 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE FIRE SERVICE AND AN

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:15.358 region:rollup2
EMT TRAINING.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:16.626 region:rollup2
SPACES RELEASED A CAL FIRE IS

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:19.295 region:rollup2
NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE.

01:08:16.626 --> 01:08:21.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IN THEIR OWN HOME.

01:08:19.295 --> 01:08:22.398 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS SO JUST MAKE A

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.032 region:rollup2
NOTE OF THAT BECAUSE I AM

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:25.301 region:rollup2
CONCERNED.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:26.803 region:rollup2
AS AN EMT MYSELF AS A PARENT I

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
WENT TO PARAMEDIC SCHOOL IN SAN

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:31.240 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN COUNTY.

01:08:28.605 --> 01:08:32.375 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GO INTO THESE HOMES.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.811 region:rollup2
THESE ARE TYPICALLY THE WORST

01:08:32.375 --> 01:08:36.613 region:rollup2
DAY THAT THESE PEOPLE NEVER HAD.

01:08:34.811 --> 01:08:39.215 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE WALK INTO THEM THEY

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.816 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE THE UTMOST TRUST.

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:41.084 region:rollup2
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.051 region:rollup2
TO HELP THEM.

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:43.886 region:rollup2
ARE NOT GONNA DO SOMETHING.

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:45.555 region:rollup2
TO HARM THEM

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.689 region:rollup2
AND I FEEL BAD TO SPEAK

01:08:45.555 --> 01:08:48.057 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION THIS BILL BECAUSE

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.859 region:rollup2
I'VE WORKED WITH EX CONS AT CAL

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.960 region:rollup2
FIRE.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.996 region:rollup2
TWO THE GUYS I WORK WITH THE SAN

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.397 region:rollup2
ANDREAS WERE FORMALLY

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:56.065 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED AND SOME OF THE

01:08:54.397 --> 01:08:56.933 region:rollup2
BEST GUYS I'VE EVER MET MY LIFE.

01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:58.635 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLE HUMAN

01:08:56.933 --> 01:09:00.903 region:rollup2
BEINGS AND THEY HAVE A PATH TO

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.438 region:rollup2
BECOME INCREDIBLE AND SUCCESSFUL

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.840 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY WHICH IS

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.674 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.775 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU'RE A RECOVERING

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
ALCOHOLIC

01:09:05.775 --> 01:09:07.710 region:rollup2
YOU PROBABLY SHOULD WORK IN A

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:09.212 region:rollup2
BAR.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:11.147 region:rollup2
IF YOUR BANK ROBBER YOU PROBABLY

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.981 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T WORK AT A BANK TELLER.

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.983 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THESE

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.951 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHEN WE TAKE A PATIENT IN

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.352 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL WE LOADED UP INTO

01:09:14.951 --> 01:09:17.420 region:rollup2
THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE.

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:19.422 region:rollup2
A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T HAVE A

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.858 region:rollup2
MEDALIST.

01:09:19.422 --> 01:09:22.692 region:rollup2
BUT THIS HAS A BAG OF PILLS.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:24.494 region:rollup2
AND WE TAKE HIM TO THE ER WITH

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:26.229 region:rollup2
US AND THE DOCTOR GOES THROUGH

01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:27.363 region:rollup2
THOSE OR THE MEDIC ON THE CALL

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.930 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN TRY TO FIGURE OUT

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.699 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:31.134 region:rollup2
PATIENT WHAT SUMMERS PREVIOUS

01:09:29.699 --> 01:09:32.802 region:rollup2
MEDICAL HISTORY MAY BE.

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:34.404 region:rollup2
IT BE VERY VERY EASY TO TEMPT

01:09:32.802 --> 01:09:35.605 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY INTO.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:36.706 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY

01:09:35.605 --> 01:09:39.475 region:rollup2
MAY OR MAY NOT OF HAD IN THE

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:41.044 region:rollup2
PAST AND OTHERS MY CONCERN IS.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.512 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO HELP THESE FOLKS OUT

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:44.547 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO GET THEM TO BECOME

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:46.149 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL. BUT IF THEY HAVE

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:47.316 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:48.651 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.819 region:rollup2
TO TEMPT THEM WITH THAT I THINK

01:09:48.651 --> 01:09:51.421 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:52.622 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN SUCCESS. SAYS MY

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.990 region:rollup2
CONCERN TO THIS BILL AYE I DO

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:55.792 region:rollup2
FILLED APOLOGIZE FOR BEING IN

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.527 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO IT. BUT I DO THINK

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:59.128 region:rollup2
THE EM THE FIREFIGHTER

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.530 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA I'M.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.664 region:rollup2
ANALOGY IS IS IS A GREAT

01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.566 region:rollup2
ANALOGY BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY

01:10:01.664 --> 01:10:04.634 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. BUT IT

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:06.135 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ACTUALLY RELATE TO THE

01:10:04.634 --> 01:10:08.071 region:rollup2
INDIAN THE LICENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:10.440 region:rollup2

KIND OF PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.249 region:rollup2
LIKE MY COLLEAGUE NEXT TO ME

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:23.720 region:rollup2
SET OF REASONS.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.388 region:rollup2
KIND OF PUTTING IT IN

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.892 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FOR YOU. MY LICENSE

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:31.627 region:rollup2

AND I UNDERSTAND.

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:41.337 region:rollup2

TO WORK THERE JUST HAVE THE

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:58.287 region:rollup2
BASIC SKILLS IT IN BASIC FIRST

01:11:01.591 --> 01:11:05.528 region:rollup2
AND AS THE ART DIRECTOR SPOKE A

MOMENT AGO. THE REAL THRUSTING

01:11:05.528 --> 01:11:09.532 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR US IS.

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:11.834 region:rollup2
THE SANCTITY OF CONFIDENCE WITH

01:11:09.532 --> 01:11:14.036 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:15.905 region:rollup2
CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE.

01:11:14.036 --> 01:11:17.573 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:18.941 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO WERE TREATING.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:20.209 region:rollup2
AS OUTLINED PREVIOUSLY WITH THE

QUITE SURE.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:27.717 region:rollup2
HOW THIS RESOLVES ANY OF THAT?

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:29.085 region:rollup2
AND IN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.586 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO OUTSIDE THE WORK

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:32.121 region:rollup2

PRACTICE.

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:39.061 region:rollup2
OR UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:40.363 region:rollup2
PRACTICE BECAUSE THEY'VE.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.964 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY'VE GOT A DUI ARREST

01:11:40.363 --> 01:11:43.232 region:rollup2

AT THE FIRST PART OF THIS

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:14.130 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION. IT DOESN'T

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:14.931 region:rollup2
CORRELATE WITH THIS LATTER PART.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.766 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THE BROADER SCOPE

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:17.266 region:rollup2

THIRTY PERCENT AND THIS IS JUST

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:40.323 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE GROUPS

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:41.557 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO HAVE A LICENSE.

01:12:40.323 --> 01:12:43.125 region:rollup2
THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL JOBS

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:45.494 region:rollup2
REQUIRE LICENSE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:47.196 region:rollup2
AND IT IT'S BEEN SAID BY SOME OF

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:49.265 region:rollup2
THE SPEAKERS THAT. YOU YOU

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:50.433 region:rollup2

AND YOU COMPLETE YOUR SENTENCE

01:12:53.269 --> 01:12:56.138 region:rollup2
FOR SOME OF THEM IT BECOMES A

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:59.008 region:rollup2
LIFE SENTENCE.

01:12:56.138 --> 01:13:01.377 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FOR PARTICULAR JOBS.

01:12:59.008 --> 01:13:03.379 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED

FROM FROM THE BILL.

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:10.019 region:rollup2
SO WHEN ANY CONCERN THAT A

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:11.554 region:rollup2
PERSON WOULD HAVE HAVING AN EMT

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:14.090 region:rollup2
OR HAVING A FIREFIGHTER COME

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:14.690 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR HOME I THINK IT WOULD

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:19.028 region:rollup2
BE THE SAME CONCERN NO MATTER

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:20.529 region:rollup2

GO THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'RE

NOT GUARANTEED A JOB JUST

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.444 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EMT LICENSE.

01:13:34.844 --> 01:13:36.946 region:rollup2
STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:38.381 region:rollup2
PROCESS

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:39.582 region:rollup2
AND THE EMPLOYER WILL STILL JUST

01:13:38.381 --> 01:13:45.388 region:rollup2
DECIDE WHO THEY'RE GOING TO

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:47.857 region:rollup2

ISSUES THAT ARE NOT IN THIS BILL

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:59.568 region:rollup2
OF AND WHAT I MEAN IS. EARLY ON

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.270 region:rollup2
THE MEMBER MENTIONED THAT.

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:02.705 region:rollup2
SHE'S AGREEING TO THE A

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.373 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY QUESTION SO

01:14:02.705 --> 01:14:05.708 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHETHER

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:07.643 region:rollup2
SOMEONE FALLS OFF THE WAGON OR

ON THE JOB WOULD NOT BE.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:12.381 region:rollup2
BE AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE THIS

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.215 region:rollup2
THE DISCIPLINARY PIECE WOULD

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:16.018 region:rollup2
REMAIN THE SAME.

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:16.953 region:rollup2
ALSO AS THE MEMBER STATED WERE

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:17.787 region:rollup2
NOT INCLUDING.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.322 region:rollup2

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.792 region:rollup2
SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE WERE

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:24.627 region:rollup2
ALSO NOT.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.795 region:rollup2
CHANGING WITH.

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:27.263 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY THERE ARE.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.831 region:rollup2
TO NINETY SO.

01:14:27.263 --> 01:14:31.534 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SORT OF

01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:33.369 region:rollup2
SEXUAL OFFENSES THAT WOULDN'T BE

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:33.936 region:rollup2
IMPACTED HERE AS WELL ARM AND

01:14:33.369 --> 01:14:35.404 region:rollup2
THEN THE OTHER THING THAT I

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:37.139 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:39.508 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND. IS THAT.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:41.944 region:rollup2
WHILE THERE MAY NOT BE A

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:43.312 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR FIREFIGHTERS AT

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:47.083 region:rollup2
CAL FIRE TO HAVE THE MT.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:49.318 region:rollup2
MOST. OF THE LOCAL AGENCIES.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:51.020 region:rollup2
DO REQUIRE IT AND AS A PRACTICAL

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.854 region:rollup2
MATTER IF YOU DON'T HAVE EMT

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.923 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A VERY HARD

01:14:51.854 --> 01:14:55.191 region:rollup2
TIME GETTING A JOB AS A

01:14:53.923 --> 01:14:56.292 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTER AND THAT'S OUR

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:58.527 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AND SO.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:15:00.262 region:rollup2

YEAH I WOULD JUST.

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:05.668 region:rollup2
MAYBE MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFERENT

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.836 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WORK WITH A MOMENT

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:09.205 region:rollup2
DAILY BASIS.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:10.773 region:rollup2
AND I SEE WHO GETS HIRED WHO

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:13.542 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GET HIRED.

01:15:10.773 --> 01:15:15.244 region:rollup2
BUTTON TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.845 region:rollup2

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.716 region:rollup2
FOR THE MOST PART.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:23.219 region:rollup2
GETS ACCEPTED.

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:24.854 region:rollup2

I BECAME BEST SYMPATHETIC TO

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:32.681 region:rollup2
THE CAUSE.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:34.517 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE I THINK IN OUR

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.918 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WE'VE GONE TOO FAR WHEN

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:37.286 region:rollup2
YOU START TO THINK ABOUT PEOPLE

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:39.088 region:rollup2
MAKE MISTAKES.

01:17:37.286 --> 01:17:39.989 region:rollup2
COMING FROM PREACHER'S KID BOMB

01:17:39.088 --> 01:17:41.490 region:rollup2

THEN AT THE PUNISHMENT AND THAT

01:17:56.172 --> 01:17:59.909 region:rollup2
BEING THE BECOMING A GREATER

01:17:58.274 --> 01:18:01.277 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WHAT WAS ACTUALLY OF

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:02.411 region:rollup2

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:49.792 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES ARM BUT THE

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:51.226 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT POINT IS THE FACT WARY

01:18:49.792 --> 01:18:53.229 region:rollup2

BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS

01:19:05.741 --> 01:19:09.645 region:rollup2
FOR EXISTING LICENSE HOLDERS AS

01:19:07.876 --> 01:19:11.614 region:rollup2
WELL IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING.

01:19:09.645 --> 01:19:12.848 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE LINE OF WORK.

01:19:11.614 --> 01:19:14.083 region:rollup2
IF SOMEBODY GOT IT DO YOU LIE

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:27.730 region:rollup2
BOOK BECAUSE AGAIN I'M VERY

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:28.664 region:rollup2
SYMPATHETIC TO THIS BECAUSE IT

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:30.299 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME GOOD

01:19:28.664 --> 01:19:31.133 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE LEFT OUT

01:19:30.299 --> 01:19:31.800 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:33.402 region:rollup2
WRONG.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:34.670 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO

01:19:33.402 --> 01:19:36.271 region:rollup2

01:19:42.077 --> 01:19:44.580 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:46.815 region:rollup2
THERE IS THAT THE PROCESS IS IS

01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:48.183 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GET A. REPORT BACK FROM

01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:50.653 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT

01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:51.920 region:rollup2
AN EMT ADD THAT WE HAVE

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:53.889 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED FOR INSTANCE.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.025 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN ARRESTED. IT STARTS

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:58.060 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS SO ONCE THEY'RE DONE

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:59.161 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR COURT CASE.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.629 region:rollup2
WE'D START LOOKING WE REQUEST

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.764 region:rollup2

THE SAME PROCESS.

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:15.311 region:rollup2
SO ONCE WE GET ALL THE DOCUMENTS

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:17.246 region:rollup2
AND WE FIND OUT.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:18.914 region:rollup2

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:21.483 region:rollup2
THE COURT ORDERED DID THEY

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:22.818 region:rollup2
COMPLETE THE COURT REQUIREMENTS?

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:24.953 region:rollup2
HOW LONG AGO THE THE CONVICTION

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:26.455 region:rollup2
MAY HAVE BEEN?

01:20:24.953 --> 01:20:27.556 region:rollup2
WE PUT WE LOOK AT IT ALL AND

01:20:26.455 --> 01:20:29.124 region:rollup2
DOES IT MEET THE MODEL DISCOVERY

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:31.193 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES

01:20:29.124 --> 01:20:32.895 region:rollup2
THAT PART ESTABLISHED.

01:20:31.193 --> 01:20:34.830 region:rollup2
BY THE STATE WHICH ALL THE

01:20:32.895 --> 01:20:36.265 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS HAD IT APART AND

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:38.467 region:rollup2
BACK INTO THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:40.302 region:rollup2
TEN.

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:41.570 region:rollup2
THEN THE ADMINISTRATOR WILL MAKE

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:43.972 region:rollup2
A RECOMMENDATION TO OUR MEDICAL

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:45.374 region:rollup2

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:06.128 region:rollup2
IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:09.531 region:rollup2
THE ADMINISTRATOR AT SACRAMENTO

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:11.467 region:rollup2
COUNTY I'VE APPROVED.

01:21:16.972 --> 01:21:19.742 region:rollup2
DENIAL.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:21.610 region:rollup2
INTO REVOCATION OF THAT EMT

SO WE HAVE THOSE PROCESSES IN

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:30.419 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS NOT ONE OF

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:33.422 region:rollup2

PARK AND REC IF THEY HAVE AN E.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.899 region:rollup2

YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IT AND I

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:27.709 region:rollup2
THINK I ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:29.344 region:rollup2
HAVE TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF MY

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:31.046 region:rollup2
MOUTH WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT.

01:22:29.344 --> 01:22:32.714 region:rollup2
YOU NOT AS AS AN EMT IF YOU'RE

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:34.283 region:rollup2
WORKING OUT THERE.

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:35.284 region:rollup2
REALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.819 region:rollup2
SUPERVISION WAS JUST YOU AND

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:38.821 region:rollup2
YOUR PARTNER IN IN DEALING WITH

01:22:36.819 --> 01:22:39.988 region:rollup2
WITH PATIENTS AT THE WORST.

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:41.690 region:rollup2
IN DEALING WITH PERSONAL

BELONGINGS AS WELL.

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:44.993 region:rollup2
BUT ONE THING I MUST SAY YOU

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:46.361 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:48.096 region:rollup2
NOT BEING A FIREFIGHTER MYSELF

01:22:46.361 --> 01:22:50.098 region:rollup2
BUT BEING.

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:51.533 region:rollup2
DISPATCHED TO WILDFIRES WITH.

01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:53.101 region:rollup2
.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.302 region:rollup2
FIRE PERSONNEL I CAN TELL YOU

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.604 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:53.302 --> 01:22:57.105 region:rollup2
.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:59.141 region:rollup2
THOSE CAMP CREWS ARE IMMIGRANTS

01:22:57.105 --> 01:23:00.809 region:rollup2
HOW PEOPLE REFER THEM TO ONE OF

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:01.143 region:rollup2
THE HARDEST WORKING GUYS OUT

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:02.678 region:rollup2
THERE I THINK.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:04.213 region:rollup2
.

01:23:02.678 --> 01:23:06.849 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES ARE HERE CAN CAN.

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:07.716 region:rollup2
CAN. AGREE WITH ME ON THAT THE

01:23:06.849 --> 01:23:09.351 region:rollup2
OTHER THE HARDEST WORKING GUYS

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:12.054 region:rollup2
NOTHING ON THE FIRE LINE. I'VE

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:13.489 region:rollup2
SEEN THEM I I'VE TING CARE SOME

01:23:12.054 --> 01:23:14.122 region:rollup2
OF THEM IF THEY GOT HURT.

01:23:13.489 --> 01:23:16.425 region:rollup2
BUT THEN OPPOSED IT PUTS ME AT

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:17.926 region:rollup2
AN AWKWARD SITUATION ON ON THE

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:19.761 region:rollup2
OTHER END OF IT. AS AN EMT AND

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:20.529 region:rollup2
AND.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:22.564 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MOTHER KALI TALKED

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:25.334 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT. NOT EVERY DEPARTMENT

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:26.235 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A INTO LICENSE.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.436 region:rollup2
I'M SOME OF SOME DO AND SOME

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:28.470 region:rollup2
DON'T SO I GUESS IN A SENSE IT

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:30.038 region:rollup2
LIMITS.

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.839 region:rollup2
YOUR AVAILABILITY RIGHT THAT YOU

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:32.207 region:rollup2
CAN ONLY APPLY FOR CERTAIN

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:34.309 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:35.677 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MAYBE AS.

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:37.312 region:rollup2
TIME CHANGES MORE DEPARTMENTS

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:39.281 region:rollup2
WILL START REQUIRING THAT.

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:39.781 region:rollup2
BUT RIGHT NOW THEIR LIMITED

01:23:39.281 --> 01:23:42.584 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT NATURE.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:44.920 region:rollup2
.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:46.355 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT SAID IT IS I'M TORN

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.956 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO GIVE

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:49.725 region:rollup2

WHAT THOSE ARE SO MAYBE. IF

THE OTHER CURRENT STATUTE

COURT.

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:49.518 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:52.287 region:rollup2
THAT TAKES A LOT.

01:24:49.518 --> 01:24:53.755 region:rollup2
AWHILE AGO MOST OF THE AGENCIES

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:55.457 region:rollup2
THAT I DEAL WITH HERE IN

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:56.925 region:rollup2
SACRAMENTO COUNTY. A THEY WILL

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:58.660 region:rollup2

THE COURT PROCESS.

01:24:59.962 --> 01:25:03.065 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE LIGHT THEIR

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:05.167 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION IS STILL GOOD

01:25:03.065 --> 01:25:06.702 region:rollup2
UNTIL MY AGENCY TAKE SOME TYPE

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:10.205 region:rollup2
OF ACTION ON IT.

01:25:06.702 --> 01:25:12.240 region:rollup2

01:25:10.205 --> 01:25:13.875 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.577 region:rollup2
STAFF BASED ON WHAT IT IS.

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:17.179 region:rollup2

PROBATIONARY TYPE. CERTIFICATION

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:23.585 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO WORK.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:26.254 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH

01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:28.223 region:rollup2
MY AGENCY AND DO CERTAIN THINGS.

01:25:26.254 --> 01:25:29.224 region:rollup2
DURING THAT PROBATION BUT MOST

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:31.827 region:rollup2
OF THE TIME THAT'S NOT UNTIL

01:25:29.224 --> 01:25:33.295 region:rollup2
AFTER THEIR COURT CASES.

01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:34.429 region:rollup2
THEN I JUST ONE MORE QUESTION

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.465 region:rollup2
COMES TO MIND.

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:37.866 region:rollup2

QUALIFICATIONS OR SPEAK.

01:26:02.224 --> 01:26:04.793 region:rollup2

THERE'S A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:22.510 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LACK OF RESOURCES.

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:23.945 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE AN IDEA I THINK IT'S

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:25.814 region:rollup2

VERY VERY BROAD FROM OUR OF.

01:44:26.127 --> 01:44:29.497 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE HOW WE VIEW THIS IS

THE ROADMAP WITH MAYBE A PIECE

01:58:51.925 --> 01:58:55.662 region:rollup2
MISSING AT THIS POINT OKAY.

01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:56.997 region:rollup2
SO JUST A COMMENT YOU KNOW

01:58:55.662 --> 01:58:58.999 region:rollup2
HAVING SERVED WITH THE TWO

01:58:56.997 --> 01:59:01.301 region:rollup2

SO MUCH INFORMATION CAME OUT IS.

01:59:03.603 --> 01:59:07.974 region:rollup2
ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT WAS.

01:59:05.805 --> 01:59:08.508 region:rollup2
IT JUST ENDED TOO SOON IN A WAY

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:09.743 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE HAD SEVERAL

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:10.176 region:rollup2
HEARINGS.

01:59:09.743 --> 01:59:11.111 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:12.379 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:59:11.111 --> 01:59:14.280 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.617 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF UNIVERSAL CARE IS

01:59:15.882 --> 01:59:19.519 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. I THINK EVERYONE

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:21.588 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT.

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:23.189 region:rollup2
BUT HOW YOU GET THERE OR THE

01:59:21.588 --> 01:59:23.390 region:rollup2
ROADBLOCKS IN AND WE CAME UP

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:25.625 region:rollup2

01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:28.728 region:rollup2
HAVING TO GET WAIVERS FROM THE

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW.

01:59:28.728 --> 01:59:31.531 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT WOULD INVOLVE I MEAN

01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:33.800 region:rollup2
THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES AND

01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:35.802 region:rollup2
COSTS AND THE SURPRISING I KNOW

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.203 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT? LOOKING AT

01:59:35.802 --> 01:59:39.339 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO REDUCE

01:59:37.203 --> 01:59:40.840 region:rollup2
COSTS AND THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM

01:59:39.339 --> 01:59:43.009 region:rollup2
TO ME HE. WAS OTHER.

01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:44.377 region:rollup2

01:59:43.009 --> 01:59:45.712 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF WE WANNA.

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:47.414 region:rollup2
WILL MOVE AHEAD AND REALLY

01:59:45.712 --> 01:59:48.681 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THAT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE

01:59:47.414 --> 01:59:50.950 region:rollup2
WE KEEP OUR SELECT COMMITTEE

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:52.886 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU. TRYING

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:57.657 region:rollup2
TO ACCOMPLISH. Y. THINK I THINK

01:59:55.989 --> 01:59:59.359 region:rollup2
IT'S ON THIS IS SUCH A COMPLEX

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:00.860 region:rollup2

WITH HOW WE COULD HOW WE COULD

02:00:06.466 --> 02:00:09.536 region:rollup2
MOVE PAST THOSE AND SO IT'S KIND

02:00:08.301 --> 02:00:10.704 region:rollup2
OF BEYOND THE PURVIEW OF THE

02:00:09.536 --> 02:00:11.905 region:rollup2
SELECT COMMITTEE IN MY OPINION

02:00:10.704 --> 02:00:13.440 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

02:00:11.905 --> 02:00:15.141 region:rollup2

A RECENT STUDY BY UC SAN DIEGO

INDICATED THAT HIGHLY DEPRESSED

AND DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD

02:04:36.669 --> 02:04:40.006 region:rollup2
SOME MAY ARGUE THAT SCREENING

02:04:38.338 --> 02:04:40.573 region:rollup2
TAKES TOO MUCH TIME AND WE'VE

02:04:40.006 --> 02:04:41.507 region:rollup2
HEARD WE'VE EVEN HEARD THAT

02:04:40.573 --> 02:04:42.642 region:rollup2

FOR THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:50.083 region:rollup2

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:47.960 region:rollup2
DUE TO INCREASE STRESSORS.

02:07:46.893 --> 02:07:49.629 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS JUST

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:51.030 region:rollup2
FOR A MINUTE.

02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:53.566 region:rollup2
RESEARCH UNFORTUNATELY SHOWS

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:54.100 region:rollup2
THAT THESE DISORDERS.

02:07:53.566 --> 02:07:55.201 region:rollup2
ARE NOT BEING DETECTED AND

02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:56.969 region:rollup2
TREATED.

02:07:55.201 --> 02:07:57.503 region:rollup2
DETECTION STARTS WITH HAVING

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:59.939 region:rollup2
PATIENTS COMPLETE A QUICK

02:07:57.503 --> 02:08:01.541 region:rollup2
SURVEY.

02:07:59.939 --> 02:08:02.508 region:rollup2
THAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED OTHER

02:08:01.541 --> 02:08:04.577 region:rollup2
VALIDATED SCREENING TOOL BY

02:08:02.508 --> 02:08:05.411 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS.

02:08:04.577 --> 02:08:07.413 region:rollup2
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF STUDIES

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:08.748 region:rollup2
SHOWING THE EFFECTIVENESS

02:08:07.413 --> 02:08:10.550 region:rollup2
OF SCREENING TO DETECT THESE

02:08:08.748 --> 02:08:12.285 region:rollup2
DISORDERS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:14.320 region:rollup2
EARLY AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT.

02:08:12.285 --> 02:08:15.988 region:rollup2
YET THE SCREENING RATES REMAIN

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:17.323 region:rollup2
LOW. AND I BELIEVE THAT ONE OF

02:08:15.988 --> 02:08:18.891 region:rollup2
THE REASONS THESE ARE LOW

02:08:17.323 --> 02:08:20.793 region:rollup2
NUMBERS COMES FROM A LACK OF

02:08:18.891 --> 02:08:22.328 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE REFERRAL. THAT WE

02:08:20.793 --> 02:08:23.729 region:rollup2
HAVE TO REFER TO BEHAVIORAL

02:08:22.328 --> 02:08:24.864 region:rollup2
HEALTH SPECIALIST ONCE WE

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:26.399 region:rollup2
SUSPECT THAT THERE IS A MENTAL

02:08:24.864 --> 02:08:27.500 region:rollup2
HEALTH DISORDER.

02:08:26.399 --> 02:08:29.035 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS LONG CONFIRMED

02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:30.069 region:rollup2
UNTREATED MATERNAL DEPRESSION

02:08:29.035 --> 02:08:31.404 region:rollup2
LEADS TO TREATMENT RESISTANT

02:08:30.069 --> 02:08:33.506 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AND IMPACTS FAMILY

02:08:31.404 --> 02:08:35.641 region:rollup2
STABILITY. AS I TELL ALL MY

02:08:33.506 --> 02:08:36.943 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IF MOMS ARE IN A GOOD

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:38.244 region:rollup2
PLACE THE FAMILY ISN'T IN A GOOD

02:08:36.943 --> 02:08:39.478 region:rollup2
PLACE.

02:08:38.244 --> 02:08:41.080 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO CRITICAL BUT YOU KNOW

02:08:39.478 --> 02:08:42.815 region:rollup2
THAT HUNDREDS OF STUDIES CONFIRM

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:44.116 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CHILD OUTCOMES

02:08:42.815 --> 02:08:45.685 region:rollup2
WHEN THESE DISORDERS ARE LEFT

02:08:45.685 --> 02:08:48.654 region:rollup2
PREGNANCY THERE'S A HIGHER RISK

02:08:47.119 --> 02:08:49.188 region:rollup2
OF ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES

AND PRETERM BIRTH.

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:55.828 region:rollup2
THE WORST FAMILY OUTCOME IS

02:08:53.759 --> 02:08:56.862 region:rollup2
STUFF IN THOSE SUICIDE IS RARE

02:08:55.828 --> 02:08:57.897 region:rollup2
IT IS KNOWN TO BE THE LEADING

02:08:56.862 --> 02:08:59.165 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE PERINATAL

QUESTIONS.

02:24:27.225 --> 02:24:31.096 region:rollup2
.

02:24:29.895 --> 02:24:31.830 region:rollup2

CLARIFICATION.

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:37.802 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES INVOLVED.

02:24:36.468 --> 02:24:39.237 region:rollup2
YEAH THE MOM HAS ONE TYPE OF

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:40.405 region:rollup2
INSURANCE THE CHILD MIGHT BE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:42.007 region:rollup2
COVERED UNDER ANOTHER. THIS

02:24:40.405 --> 02:24:44.609 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT KINDS OF.

02:24:42.007 --> 02:24:45.710 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW COVERAGES.

02:24:44.609 --> 02:24:47.612 region:rollup2
HOW WOULD THIS BILL AFFECT?

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:49.381 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:52.551 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS NAVIGATING YOU KNOW

02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:53.985 region:rollup2
RECOVERED.

02:24:52.551 --> 02:24:55.453 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY QUESTION I THINK

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:56.721 region:rollup2
THAT THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS

02:24:55.453 --> 02:24:57.789 region:rollup2
WOULD DEPEND ON WHO'S DOING THE

02:24:56.721 --> 02:24:59.357 region:rollup2
SCREEN SPECIFICALLY IF THE SPELL

02:24:57.789 --> 02:25:01.293 region:rollup2
WAS.

02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:02.661 region:rollup2
AND ACTED AND THE PEDIATRICIAN

02:25:01.293 --> 02:25:04.429 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDED THE SCREEN AND I

02:25:02.661 --> 02:25:05.931 region:rollup2
DURING THE PEDIATRIC VISIT FOR

02:25:04.429 --> 02:25:06.998 region:rollup2
THE CHILD AND IDENTIFIED THAT

02:25:05.931 --> 02:25:08.767 region:rollup2
THE MOTHER WAS SUFFERING FROM

02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:10.168 region:rollup2
POSTPARTUM. IF THE MOTHER OF THE

02:25:08.767 --> 02:25:11.870 region:rollup2
CHILD WERE UNDER DIFFERENT

02:25:10.168 --> 02:25:13.672 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PERHAPS THE FATHER OR

02:25:11.870 --> 02:25:15.140 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PARENT. PROVIDED THE

02:25:13.672 --> 02:25:16.575 region:rollup2
CHILD'S INSURANCE AND THE MOTHER

02:25:15.140 --> 02:25:18.210 region:rollup2
WAS ON HER OWN.

02:25:16.575 --> 02:25:20.478 region:rollup2
THAT HOW THE CASE MANAGEMENT

02:25:18.210 --> 02:25:21.746 region:rollup2
WOULD GO BETWEEN A PEDIATRICIAN

02:25:20.478 --> 02:25:23.281 region:rollup2
WHO TO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

02:25:21.746 --> 02:25:24.649 region:rollup2
CARE OF THE MOTHER AND FOR THE

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:27.118 region:rollup2
TREATING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER

02:25:24.649 --> 02:25:28.753 region:rollup2
IN TWO DIFFERENT SYSTEMS I'M NOT

02:25:27.118 --> 02:25:29.688 region:rollup2
SURE HOW THOSE WOULD INTERACT.

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:31.323 region:rollup2
I DO KNOW THAT THE HEALTH PLAN

02:25:29.688 --> 02:25:32.691 region:rollup2
WITH THE CHILD'S INSURANCE WILL

02:25:31.323 --> 02:25:34.559 region:rollup2
BE COVERING. YOU NO THE

02:25:32.691 --> 02:25:35.327 region:rollup2
PEDIATRIC ISIT AND THE MOTHER'S

02:25:34.559 --> 02:25:37.095 region:rollup2
HEALTH INSURANCE WOULD BE

02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:38.597 region:rollup2
COVERING THE MOTHER'S MENTAL

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:40.231 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES.

02:25:38.597 --> 02:25:41.866 region:rollup2
BUT HOW THOSE TWO WOULD BE

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:43.768 region:rollup2
MANAGED IF YOU HAD TWO DIFFERENT

02:25:41.866 --> 02:25:45.537 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS NOT NECESSARILY WITH

02:25:43.768 --> 02:25:47.105 region:rollup2
ONE INSURANCE COMPANY. HOW THE

02:25:45.537 --> 02:25:49.074 region:rollup2
CASE MANAGEMENT COORDINATION

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:50.875 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK IS A QUESTION THAT WE

02:25:49.074 --> 02:25:52.811 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AS WELL?

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:55.280 region:rollup2
SO DOES THE BILL REQUIRE THE

02:25:52.811 --> 02:25:55.914 region:rollup2
OBGYN TO DO THE INITIAL POST

02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:58.783 region:rollup2
PARTUM.

02:25:55.914 --> 02:26:00.752 region:rollup2
SCREENING.

02:25:58.783 --> 02:26:02.754 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:26:00.752 --> 02:26:05.023 region:rollup2
BUT THEN LATER THEY ALWAYS GO

02:26:02.754 --> 02:26:07.225 region:rollup2
FOR THE WELL BABY. SO.

02:26:05.023 --> 02:26:09.227 region:rollup2
DOES A COVER THAT TOO I MEAN

02:26:07.225 --> 02:26:10.195 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S A PROGRESSION.

02:26:09.227 --> 02:26:11.496 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

02:26:10.195 --> 02:26:13.131 region:rollup2
BIT OF SORT OF.

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:14.132 region:rollup2
MAYBE THIS IS ALL ABOUT APPLES

02:26:13.131 --> 02:26:15.066 region:rollup2
AND ORANGES THAT YOU'RE I THINK

02:26:14.132 --> 02:26:16.434 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKED ABOUT INSURANCE

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:18.203 region:rollup2
COVERAGE ISSUE AND THIS ISN'T

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:20.038 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS

02:26:18.203 --> 02:26:21.640 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SCREENING AND SHE'LL.

02:26:20.038 --> 02:26:22.941 region:rollup2
BE OBG.

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.576 region:rollup2
DOWN THE ROAD WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

02:26:22.941 --> 02:26:25.543 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TREATMENT.

02:26:24.576 --> 02:26:26.711 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S ABOUT IT IS THAT

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.746 region:rollup2
THAT AS A PROBLEM BUT THAT'S AN

02:26:26.711 --> 02:26:29.547 region:rollup2
ONGOING PROBLEM THAT WOULD BE

02:26:27.746 --> 02:26:30.782 region:rollup2
SEPARATE FROM MY DEL THERE ISN'T

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:32.450 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TREATMENT WE GOING TO

02:26:30.782 --> 02:26:33.652 region:rollup2
THAT AND WE WE HAVE.

02:26:32.450 --> 02:26:36.554 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS THIS IS SIMPLY ABOUT

02:26:33.652 --> 02:26:39.224 region:rollup2
THE SCREEN.

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:40.625 region:rollup2

WORK SOMETHING OUT AS THIS GOES.

02:26:48.333 --> 02:26:50.402 region:rollup2

02:27:24.569 --> 02:27:27.038 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD COUNTLESS MEETINGS ON

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:28.373 region:rollup2
THIS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO

02:27:27.038 --> 02:27:29.007 region:rollup2
THAT'S I THINK. MOST OF YOUR

02:27:28.373 --> 02:27:30.508 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO GET

02:27:29.007 --> 02:27:32.143 region:rollup2
ANSWERED I WOULD SAY THOUGH IT I

02:27:30.508 --> 02:27:33.144 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

02:27:32.143 --> 02:27:35.013 region:rollup2
BETWEEN COVERAGE ISSUE.

02:27:33.144 --> 02:27:36.648 region:rollup2
AND SCREEN THIS THIS STILL

02:27:35.013 --> 02:27:38.683 region:rollup2
REFERS TO SCREEN.

02:27:36.648 --> 02:27:41.052 region:rollup2
SO AS AS COVERAGE MAY PROGRESS

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:41.653 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF TREATMENT OF A MAMA

02:27:41.052 --> 02:27:43.354 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BABY

02:27:41.653 --> 02:27:45.023 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:46.291 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S ENTAILED

02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:48.259 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE PARAMETERS OF THIS

02:27:46.291 --> 02:27:49.394 region:rollup2
BILL THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:51.396 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD

02:27:49.394 --> 02:27:53.231 region:rollup2
ADDRESS. BUT IT'S NOT THAT'S

02:27:51.396 --> 02:27:54.999 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ADDRESSED WAY

02:27:53.231 --> 02:27:56.634 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS VEHICLE ONE. OF THE

02:27:54.999 --> 02:27:58.370 region:rollup2
OTHER THING I HAD WAS FOURTEEN

02:27:56.634 --> 02:27:58.837 region:rollup2
STATES HAVE ALREADY PASSED LAWS

02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:00.839 region:rollup2
RELATING.

02:27:58.837 --> 02:28:01.940 region:rollup2
SIMILAR.

02:28:00.839 --> 02:28:04.142 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S DIFFERENT WON SOME

02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:06.711 region:rollup2
OF THEM EDUCATION MANDATE.

02:28:04.142 --> 02:28:09.147 region:rollup2
SCREENING MANDATES.

02:28:06.711 --> 02:28:10.715 region:rollup2
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION AWARENESS

02:28:09.147 --> 02:28:11.750 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGNS WITH JUST VERY

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:14.386 region:rollup2
CRITICAL.

02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:14.919 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE IN THE TASK FORCE WAS

02:28:14.386 --> 02:28:17.589 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT.

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:18.823 region:rollup2
SO.

02:28:17.589 --> 02:28:21.292 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SCREENING

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:23.862 region:rollup2
MANDATES.

02:28:21.292 --> 02:28:25.430 region:rollup2
AND. WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN AS FAR

02:28:23.862 --> 02:28:27.432 region:rollup2
AS OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE

02:28:25.430 --> 02:28:35.273 region:rollup2
SCREENING MANDATES HOW THAT HAS

02:28:27.432 --> 02:28:36.508 region:rollup2
WORK OR NOT WORK?

02:28:35.273 --> 02:28:38.376 region:rollup2
JOY BURKHARD I WAS WITH THE

02:28:36.508 --> 02:28:40.011 region:rollup2
MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH TASK

02:28:38.376 --> 02:28:41.279 region:rollup2
FORCE THAT ISSUED THE REPORT.

02:28:40.011 --> 02:28:43.014 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK EACH OF OUR

COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED

02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:47.018 region:rollup2

02:28:45.316 --> 02:28:49.354 region:rollup2
TASK FORCE FUNCTION MUCH LIKE A

02:28:47.018 --> 02:28:51.623 region:rollup2

HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE AND.

02:28:59.998 --> 02:29:03.735 region:rollup2
IT DOCUMENT SOME OF THE WORK

THAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE.

02:29:03.735 --> 02:29:05.670 region:rollup2
THIS WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA I

02:29:04.636 --> 02:29:07.439 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:10.108 region:rollup2
EVERYONE KNOWS OF HAS BEEN IN

02:29:07.439 --> 02:29:11.509 region:rollup2

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:15.847 region:rollup2
RESOLUTIONS CAMP AWARENESS

02:29:13.378 --> 02:29:17.649 region:rollup2

02:29:15.847 --> 02:29:18.950 region:rollup2
BEEN ADDRESSED NOT PUBLICLY

02:29:17.649 --> 02:29:20.685 region:rollup2
FUNDED YET.

02:29:18.950 --> 02:29:23.154 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS ANOTHER BILL THAT.

02:29:20.685 --> 02:29:24.456 region:rollup2
THAT A BRAIN MAIENSCHEIN IS ALSO

02:29:23.154 --> 02:29:26.391 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:29:24.456 --> 02:29:28.593 region:rollup2
A FUNDING BILL FEDERAL FUNDS

02:29:26.391 --> 02:29:29.227 region:rollup2
BILL WHICH WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS

02:29:28.593 --> 02:29:32.897 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AS

02:29:29.227 --> 02:29:34.566 region:rollup2
WELL. ON THE REPORT CALLS FOR

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:36.301 region:rollup2
THE URGENT NEED TO SCREEN.

02:29:34.566 --> 02:29:38.102 region:rollup2
SCREEN WOMEN SO THESE STORIES

02:29:36.301 --> 02:29:39.904 region:rollup2
DON'T KEEP HAPPENING IT'S A

02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:41.472 region:rollup2
STARTING PLACE WE KNOW IT'S A.

02:29:39.904 --> 02:29:42.574 region:rollup2
VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM THAT

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:45.210 region:rollup2
THERE'S MULTIPLE PLAYERS THAT

02:29:42.574 --> 02:29:46.778 region:rollup2
CAN AND TAKE A ROLL. THE REPORT

02:29:45.210 --> 02:29:49.080 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGES THE CRITICAL ROLE

02:29:46.778 --> 02:29:50.448 region:rollup2
OF THE OBGYN IN SCREENING FOR

02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:51.950 region:rollup2
THESE DISORDERS BECAUSE THEY CAN

02:29:50.448 --> 02:29:53.852 region:rollup2
OCCUR AS FREQUENTLY DURING

02:29:51.950 --> 02:29:55.220 region:rollup2
PREGNANCY. NOT JUST IN THE POST

02:29:53.852 --> 02:29:57.322 region:rollup2
PARTUM WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT

02:29:55.220 --> 02:29:58.723 region:rollup2
OFTEN WE ALSO KNOW A LOT OF

02:29:57.322 --> 02:30:00.158 region:rollup2
WOMEN WILL SUFFER FROM A

02:29:58.723 --> 02:30:01.626 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. BEFORE

02:30:00.158 --> 02:30:02.927 region:rollup2
THEY GET PREGNANT

02:30:01.626 --> 02:30:04.963 region:rollup2
THESE DISORDERS WHEN LEFT

02:30:02.927 --> 02:30:05.496 region:rollup2
UNTREATED CAN LEAD TO PRETERM

02:30:04.963 --> 02:30:07.432 region:rollup2
BIRTH WHICH WE NO COST THE

02:30:05.496 --> 02:30:09.067 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:30:07.432 --> 02:30:10.201 region:rollup2
THOUSAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

02:30:09.067 --> 02:30:10.768 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:12.937 region:rollup2
THAT OBGYN SERVICE THE HOME

02:30:10.768 --> 02:30:14.839 region:rollup2
BASE.

02:30:12.937 --> 02:30:16.407 region:rollup2
NO OTHER DOCTOR SHOULD NOT ON

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:17.508 region:rollup2
SCREEN SO DOCTOR SHOULD SCREEN

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:19.744 region:rollup2
OTHER SHOULD AS WELL BUT O.

02:30:17.508 --> 02:30:20.378 region:rollup2
BITCOINS MUST BE THE HOME BASE

02:30:19.744 --> 02:30:22.780 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S OF KNOWLEDGE IN THIS

02:30:20.378 --> 02:30:25.383 region:rollup2
REPORT.

02:30:22.780 --> 02:30:27.318 region:rollup2
.

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:30.021 region:rollup2
STILL MY LAST QUESTION IS THERE

02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:34.058 region:rollup2
A BEST PRACTICE PROTOCOL.

02:30:30.021 --> 02:30:36.461 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ON WELL CHILD VISITS.

02:30:34.058 --> 02:30:38.897 region:rollup2
IS THAT PART OF WHAT.

02:30:36.461 --> 02:30:39.330 region:rollup2
A PEDIATRICIAN IS LOOKING AT.

02:30:38.897 --> 02:30:41.232 region:rollup2
YEAH AND IF I COULD.

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:42.433 region:rollup2
.

02:30:41.232 --> 02:30:43.835 region:rollup2
BRIAN IF WE COULD MENTION ONE OF

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:45.803 region:rollup2
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE LOOKING

02:30:43.835 --> 02:30:47.305 region:rollup2
OUT ITS TO HAVE OBGYN SCREEN AND

02:30:45.803 --> 02:30:48.773 region:rollup2
PERHAPS DROP THE SCREENING

02:30:47.305 --> 02:30:50.041 region:rollup2
MANDATE ON OTHER PROVIDERS WE

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:51.776 region:rollup2
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE.

02:30:50.041 --> 02:30:53.144 region:rollup2
THAT FIRST TIME.

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:54.679 region:rollup2
SO AT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

02:30:53.144 --> 02:30:56.180 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIANS.

PEDIATRICIANS BUT VERY VERY ST

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:01.286 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS HAVE COME OUT WITH

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:02.887 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:31:01.286 --> 02:31:04.489 region:rollup2
SCREENING PEDIATRICIANS ARE VERY

02:31:02.887 --> 02:31:06.457 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN THIS.

02:31:04.489 --> 02:31:08.092 region:rollup2
THIS I'M WORK BECAUSE UNTREATED

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:08.526 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION NEGATIVELY IMPACTS AS

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:10.495 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE HEARD CHILD

DR WHICH IS WHY OBGYN SO CALLED

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.971 region:rollup2

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:21.172 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT OBGYN SCAN PRESCRIBE

02:31:19.971 --> 02:31:21.773 region:rollup2

PATHWAYS SIX CETERA THAT'S NOT

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:27.612 region:rollup2
THE ROLE OF THE PEDIATRICIAN AT

02:31:25.977 --> 02:31:29.781 region:rollup2

02:32:04.649 --> 02:32:08.152 region:rollup2

REVIEW.

02:41:52.469 --> 02:41:54.805 region:rollup2
OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

02:41:53.604 --> 02:41:56.407 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT

02:41:54.805 --> 02:41:57.875 region:rollup2
STRIDES IN INCREASING ACCESS TO

02:41:56.407 --> 02:41:59.043 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE WHY ARE UNINSURED

02:41:57.875 --> 02:42:00.611 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS DROPPED. BY NEARLY

02:41:59.043 --> 02:42:02.313 region:rollup2
HALF.

02:42:00.611 --> 02:42:03.914 region:rollup2
HOWEVER. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE MADE

02:42:02.313 --> 02:42:05.416 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN INCREASING

02:42:03.914 --> 02:42:06.917 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE MANY

02:42:05.416 --> 02:42:08.586 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO FOREGO NEEDED

02:42:06.917 --> 02:42:09.887 region:rollup2
MEDICAL TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE

02:42:08.586 --> 02:42:11.822 region:rollup2
CONTINUED YOUR BY YOUR INCREASES

02:42:09.887 --> 02:42:13.357 region:rollup2
AND HEALTHCARE COSTS.

02:42:11.822 --> 02:42:15.593 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE HAS BECOME FAR TOO

02:42:13.357 --> 02:42:17.728 region:rollup2
EXPENSES AND IF IT CONTINUES

02:42:15.593 --> 02:42:18.195 region:rollup2
WILL BECOME UNSUSTAINABLE NOT

02:42:17.728 --> 02:42:20.164 region:rollup2
JUST FOR THOSE WITHOUT

02:42:18.195 --> 02:42:22.166 region:rollup2
INSURANCE.

02:42:20.164 --> 02:42:23.434 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WITH IT.

02:42:22.166 --> 02:42:24.501 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY DOES IT IMPACT THE

02:42:23.434 --> 02:42:26.503 region:rollup2
STATE'S ABILITY TO FUND

02:42:24.501 --> 02:42:28.305 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PRIORITIES SUCH AS

02:42:26.503 --> 02:42:29.873 region:rollup2
EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION. AND IS

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:31.775 region:rollup2
HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

02:42:29.873 --> 02:42:33.978 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:42:31.775 --> 02:42:35.079 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES TO AFFORD. AN OFFER

02:42:33.978 --> 02:42:36.680 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE BENEFITS TO THEIR

02:42:35.079 --> 02:42:38.182 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:39.583 region:rollup2
IN FACT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS

02:42:38.182 --> 02:42:40.884 region:rollup2
STATE BUDGET EXPENDITURES ON

02:42:39.583 --> 02:42:43.020 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE HAVE INCREASED BY

02:42:40.884 --> 02:42:44.488 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT YEAR OVER. YEAR

02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:45.789 region:rollup2
THE PAST TEN YEARS AND

02:42:44.488 --> 02:42:47.558 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSES ARE

02:42:45.789 --> 02:42:48.959 region:rollup2
INCREASINGLY FOR DON OFFERING

02:42:47.558 --> 02:42:50.060 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYEES HEALTHCARE

02:42:48.959 --> 02:42:51.662 region:rollup2
INSURANCE WERE ONLY FIFTY FIVE

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:53.163 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES.

02:42:51.662 --> 02:42:54.064 region:rollup2
HAVE REPORTED PROVIDING

02:42:53.163 --> 02:42:55.399 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE INSURANCE TO

02:42:54.064 --> 02:42:57.267 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:42:55.399 --> 02:42:58.902 region:rollup2
WHICH IS DOWN FROM SIXTY NINE

02:42:57.267 --> 02:43:00.204 region:rollup2
PERCENT IN TWO THOUSAND.

02:42:58.902 --> 02:43:01.238 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE'RE SEEING

02:43:00.204 --> 02:43:02.806 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MAKE SERIOUS AND

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:04.675 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DEBILITATING HELD

02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:06.610 region:rollup2
DECISIONS DUE. TO THE COST OF

02:43:04.675 --> 02:43:07.645 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE.

02:43:06.610 --> 02:43:09.280 region:rollup2
IN A RECENT REPORT BY THE

02:43:07.645 --> 02:43:10.748 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO WAS FOUND

02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:12.349 region:rollup2
UP FORTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS

02:43:10.748 --> 02:43:15.252 region:rollup2
SKIPPED A RECOMMENDED MEDICAL

02:43:12.349 --> 02:43:16.220 region:rollup2
TESTS OR TREATMENT. DUE TO COST.

02:43:15.252 --> 02:43:17.855 region:rollup2
WHAT ALL THIS INFORMATION

02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:19.356 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CURRENT

02:43:17.855 --> 02:43:21.592 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORY OF HEALTHCARE COSTS

02:43:19.356 --> 02:43:23.260 region:rollup2
IS UNSUSTAINABLE?

02:43:21.592 --> 02:43:24.828 region:rollup2
IT BEGAN TEN YEARS TO GO ON

02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:27.298 region:rollup2
UNADDRESSED IN THAT COULD WELL

02:43:24.828 --> 02:43:28.666 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE WILL WORSEN.

02:43:27.298 --> 02:43:29.500 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES WILL

02:43:28.666 --> 02:43:31.101 region:rollup2
INCREASE AND THE

02:43:29.500 --> 02:43:33.037 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE USE OF MEDICAL

02:43:31.101 --> 02:43:34.204 region:rollup2
CARE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN AND

02:43:33.037 --> 02:43:36.140 region:rollup2
CANNOT AFFORD THEIR HEALTHCARE

02:43:34.204 --> 02:43:37.675 region:rollup2
WILL EXPAND.

02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:39.677 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY I HAVE OP AUTHORED

02:43:37.675 --> 02:43:41.311 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN THE

02:43:39.677 --> 02:43:42.846 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE PRICE RELIEF ACT

02:43:41.311 --> 02:43:44.281 region:rollup2
WHICH WILL ESTABLISH AN

02:43:42.846 --> 02:43:46.183 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT HEALTH CARE COST.

02:43:44.281 --> 02:43:47.451 region:rollup2
QUALITY AND EQUITY COMMISSION TO

CAN COLLECT FROM PARIS.

02:43:53.757 --> 02:43:56.527 region:rollup2
THE ELEVEN MEMBER COMMISSION

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:58.929 region:rollup2
WOULD BUILD OFF OF WOULD BUILD

MEDICARE ADVANTAGE REYES TO

02:44:04.068 --> 02:44:07.738 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A CAPITATED AMOUNT

02:44:05.636 --> 02:44:09.306 region:rollup2
THAT HEALTH PLANS MUST USE AS A

02:44:07.738 --> 02:44:11.208 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR PREMIUMS.

02:44:09.306 --> 02:44:12.576 region:rollup2
BY BUILDING UPON EXISTING MODELS

02:44:11.208 --> 02:44:14.511 region:rollup2
WE CAN ESTABLISH A TRANSPARENT

02:44:12.576 --> 02:44:15.846 region:rollup2
PROCESS BY WHICH INCREASES IN

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:17.848 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COSTS CAN BE KEPT

02:44:15.846 --> 02:44:19.683 region:rollup2
REASONABLE. CONTINUE TO EXPAND

02:44:17.848 --> 02:44:21.018 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE AND PROVIDE OUR

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:22.086 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WITH THE

02:44:21.018 --> 02:44:24.254 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO RECEIVE A FAIR RETURN

02:44:22.086 --> 02:44:25.989 region:rollup2
ON INVESTMENT.

02:44:24.254 --> 02:44:27.424 region:rollup2
IN DOING SO WE CAN HELP ADDRESS

02:44:25.989 --> 02:44:28.859 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF

02:44:27.424 --> 02:44:30.160 region:rollup2
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BY

02:44:28.859 --> 02:44:31.495 region:rollup2
DRESSING UNREASONABLE AND

02:44:30.160 --> 02:44:32.763 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS RATES WHILE

MAINTAINING ACCESS TO QUALITY

02:44:32.763 --> 02:44:35.499 region:rollup2
CARE FOR ALL.

02:44:34.431 --> 02:44:36.800 region:rollup2
I WANTED ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:44:35.499 --> 02:44:38.335 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE REGULARLY

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:40.404 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT THE BILL. SIDE LEGAL

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:41.538 region:rollup2
HELP TO CLARIFY WHERE CERTAIN

02:44:40.404 --> 02:44:43.140 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS OF GOT LOST IN

02:44:41.538 --> 02:44:44.441 region:rollup2
TRANSLATION OR MISINFORMATION IS

02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:45.642 region:rollup2
ADDED TO THE CONFUSION ABOUT THE

02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:47.244 region:rollup2
BILL.

02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:48.712 region:rollup2
A FREE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S

02:44:47.244 --> 02:44:49.880 region:rollup2
BEEN REYES IS THAT THIS BILL

02:44:48.712 --> 02:44:51.582 region:rollup2
WOULD LET LEAD TO RATIONING OF

02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:52.716 region:rollup2
CARE AND COST POSITIONS TO FLEE

02:44:51.582 --> 02:44:54.251 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND HOSPITALS CLOSE

02:44:52.716 --> 02:44:56.120 region:rollup2
OUR DOORS.

02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:57.755 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT TRUE RATHER A. B.

02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:59.156 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WHAT COUNTER

02:44:57.755 --> 02:45:00.557 region:rollup2
WHAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING IN

02:44:59.156 --> 02:45:02.426 region:rollup2
OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:03.360 region:rollup2
TODAY THE RATION OF HEALTHCARE

02:45:02.426 --> 02:45:04.962 region:rollup2
BY THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT. THE

02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:07.097 region:rollup2
MOST

02:45:04.962 --> 02:45:09.133 region:rollup2
AYE DO THE COST OF CARE MANY ARE

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:09.666 region:rollup2
REGULARLY CHOOSING TO FORGO A

02:45:09.133 --> 02:45:11.135 region:rollup2

THE FOOD ON THE TABLE OR PAY

THEIR UTILITY BILL.

02:45:14.571 --> 02:45:16.740 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT

02:45:15.406 --> 02:45:19.176 region:rollup2
RATES ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE NEED

02:45:16.740 --> 02:45:20.644 region:rollup2
TO MAINTAIN AND EXPAND ACCESS TO

02:45:19.176 --> 02:45:22.813 region:rollup2
NOT JUST QUALITY MEDICAL CARE

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:24.047 region:rollup2
BUT AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE.

02:45:22.813 --> 02:45:25.149 region:rollup2
REGARDING PHYSICIANS AND

02:45:24.047 --> 02:45:26.617 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS WE ARE ALREADY

02:45:25.149 --> 02:45:28.385 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF

02:45:26.617 --> 02:45:29.353 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE

02:45:28.385 --> 02:45:31.188 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONTLINE OF OUR

02:45:29.353 --> 02:45:33.056 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND WATCHING

02:45:31.188 --> 02:45:33.891 region:rollup2
US HOSPITAL'S CONSOLIDATE. AND

02:45:33.056 --> 02:45:35.526 region:rollup2
SHUDDER HEALTHCARE FACILITIES IN

02:45:33.891 --> 02:45:36.660 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS.

02:45:35.526 --> 02:45:38.128 region:rollup2
AS OPPOSED TO OUR CURRENT

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:40.097 region:rollup2
REALITY ASSAULT RATION

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:41.165 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE DUE TO COST AB THIRTY

02:45:40.097 --> 02:45:42.866 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SEVEN WOULD ENSURE THAT

02:45:41.165 --> 02:45:44.802 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATES ARE TIED TO

02:45:42.866 --> 02:45:47.171 region:rollup2
IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND

02:45:44.802 --> 02:45:48.639 region:rollup2
REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES.

02:45:47.171 --> 02:45:50.073 region:rollup2
FURTHER AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN

02:45:48.639 --> 02:45:51.675 region:rollup2
ALSO TAKES INTO ACCOUNT WHAT IS

02:45:50.073 --> 02:45:53.076 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:54.278 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE.

02:45:53.076 --> 02:45:55.612 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE'S A FAIR AND

02:45:54.278 --> 02:45:57.347 region:rollup2
REASONABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT

02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:58.715 region:rollup2
FOR PROVIDERS.

02:45:57.347 --> 02:45:59.716 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE HEARD IS

02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:01.985 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:02.786 region:rollup2
ADDRESS INADEQUATE MEDICAL RATES

02:46:01.985 --> 02:46:04.288 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE A DRIVER OF COST

02:46:02.786 --> 02:46:05.856 region:rollup2
SHIFTING BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND

02:46:04.288 --> 02:46:06.857 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL RATES.

02:46:05.856 --> 02:46:08.292 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

02:46:06.857 --> 02:46:10.260 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT

02:46:08.292 --> 02:46:10.794 region:rollup2
COST SHIFTING FROM A MORE

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.496 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT HAS

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:14.231 region:rollup2
OCCURRED. ABOUT USUALLY AT A

02:46:12.496 --> 02:46:15.566 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY LOW RATE THE BILL

02:46:14.231 --> 02:46:16.934 region:rollup2
DOES INCLUDE LANGUAGE TAKE INTO

02:46:15.566 --> 02:46:17.835 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THE NUMBER OF. NUMBER OF

02:46:16.934 --> 02:46:19.136 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PATIENTS PROVIDERS

02:46:17.835 --> 02:46:20.971 region:rollup2
SERVE

02:46:19.136 --> 02:46:21.972 region:rollup2
THE FISCAL IMPACT ASSOCIATED AND

02:46:20.971 --> 02:46:23.740 region:rollup2
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RATE AS

02:46:21.972 --> 02:46:24.942 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:26.877 region:rollup2
LASTLY CONCERN WE HAVE HEARD

02:46:24.942 --> 02:46:28.011 region:rollup2
REGULARLY THIS BILL AS A VEILED

02:46:26.877 --> 02:46:29.780 region:rollup2
ATTEMPT AND MEANT MEDICARE FOR

02:46:28.011 --> 02:46:31.348 region:rollup2
ALL OR TO KEEP RATES AT AT OR

02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:32.716 region:rollup2
NEAR MEDICARE AMOUNTS.

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:33.550 region:rollup2
THIS IS UNTRUE AND AS AN

02:46:32.716 --> 02:46:34.985 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT I BELIEVE IS

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:36.687 region:rollup2
MISLEADING A MISREPRESENTATION

02:46:34.985 --> 02:46:37.588 region:rollup2
OF EFFORTS MY OFFICE MADE TO

02:46:36.687 --> 02:46:38.889 region:rollup2
HELP STAKEHOLDERS READ THROUGH

02:46:37.588 --> 02:46:40.090 region:rollup2
THE BILL LANGUAGE.

02:46:38.889 --> 02:46:41.792 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IN ONE OF THE

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:42.893 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS WE USED TO HELP

02:46:41.792 --> 02:46:44.862 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS UNDERSTAND THE

02:46:42.893 --> 02:46:45.929 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROVISIONS WE INCLUDED

02:46:44.862 --> 02:46:47.297 region:rollup2
AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MEDICARE

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:48.899 region:rollup2
RATE CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:50.000 region:rollup2
PROVIDER MAYES.

02:46:48.899 --> 02:46:50.934 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WOULD READ THAT

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.436 region:rollup2
RATES COULD BE UNDER TWENTY FIVE

OR HIGHER.

02:46:53.937 --> 02:46:56.506 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SOME MISREPRESENTED THIS

02:46:55.706 --> 02:46:57.774 region:rollup2
AFTER TO STATE THAT THE BILL

02:46:56.506 --> 02:46:58.709 region:rollup2
WOULD SET RATES AT A HUNDRED

02:46:57.774 --> 02:47:00.377 region:rollup2

CALIFORNIA THAT PAYMENT

02:47:04.848 --> 02:47:09.620 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS WILL NEED AN ESTIMATE

02:47:06.917 --> 02:47:10.220 region:rollup2
A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND.

02:47:09.620 --> 02:47:10.754 region:rollup2

THEIR JOBS.

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:14.291 region:rollup2
THAT'S OF OF A HYPOTHETICAL

02:47:12.623 --> 02:47:15.926 region:rollup2
DOES NOT BASED IN FACT AND IT'S

02:47:14.291 --> 02:47:17.060 region:rollup2
INCORRECT AND MISLEADING.

02:47:15.926 --> 02:47:18.729 region:rollup2
RATHER AS MANY OF YOU KNOW

02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:20.964 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATES ARE OFTEN USED BY

02:47:18.729 --> 02:47:22.232 region:rollup2
POSITIONS HOSPITALS INSURERS TO

CONTRACT RAISE. IT IS USED AS

02:47:24.468 --> 02:47:27.104 region:rollup2
THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH

02:47:32.643 --> 02:47:36.313 region:rollup2
APPROACH USED FOR A. B. THIRTY

02:47:34.044 --> 02:47:38.115 region:rollup2
EIGHTY SEVEN ONE THAT DOES NOT

02:47:36.313 --> 02:47:40.050 region:rollup2
SET A PROVIDER RATE CEILING JUST

02:47:38.115 --> 02:47:42.686 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITE THAT SETS A FLOOR

02:47:40.050 --> 02:47:43.954 region:rollup2
USING EXISTING. MEDICARE RATES

02:47:42.686 --> 02:47:45.289 region:rollup2
I'M NOT LOOKING TO GO BACK AND

02:47:43.954 --> 02:47:47.324 region:rollup2
SET RATES WHERE THEY WERE TWENTY

02:47:45.289 --> 02:47:48.659 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THIS IS THE PROSPECT

02:47:47.324 --> 02:47:50.093 region:rollup2
OF BILL WHEREBY THE COMMISSION

02:47:48.659 --> 02:47:52.162 region:rollup2
WILL BE LOOKING AT TODAY. AND

02:47:50.093 --> 02:47:53.263 region:rollup2
GOING INTO THE FUTURE.

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:54.698 region:rollup2
THE NOTION OF THIS ONLY GONNA

02:47:53.263 --> 02:47:56.767 region:rollup2
LEAD TO CUTS IN CURRENT RATES

02:47:54.698 --> 02:47:57.768 region:rollup2
ARE SIMPLY NOT TRUE. AS THE

02:47:56.767 --> 02:47:59.469 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS REQUIRED TO SET

02:47:57.768 --> 02:48:00.570 region:rollup2
REYES A FAIR MARKET VALUE. AND

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:01.338 region:rollup2
FOSTER A MORE ACTIVE WILL

02:48:00.570 --> 02:48:02.506 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR ALL

02:48:01.338 --> 02:48:05.142 region:rollup2

SIMPLY PUT SHARON MEMBERS THE

02:48:05.142 --> 02:48:09.146 region:rollup2
STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE.

02:48:07.611 --> 02:48:10.814 region:rollup2
AND IF WE MAINTAIN THIS IS THE

02:48:09.146 --> 02:48:11.949 region:rollup2
WAY THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET

02:48:10.814 --> 02:48:13.684 region:rollup2
UP WE'RE GONNA SEE MORE

02:48:11.949 --> 02:48:15.752 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS MORE SMALL

02:48:13.684 --> 02:48:17.487 region:rollup2

SUSTAINABLE SYSTEM TO.

02:48:25.295 --> 02:48:29.299 region:rollup2

ENSURE THAT EVERYONE CAN COME TO

02:48:29.299 --> 02:48:32.636 region:rollup2

02:52:39.282 --> 02:52:41.451 region:rollup2

RESULTED FROM PRICE INFLATION.

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:20.116 region:rollup2
THIS CONFIRMS A CONSENSUS IN THE

02:54:19.082 --> 02:54:21.685 region:rollup2
EXPERT LITERATURE THAT THE CORE

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:23.019 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH HEALTHCARE COSTS IN

HEART OF THIS ISSUE WE'RE URGING

02:54:29.192 --> 02:54:34.597 region:rollup2

TO CO SPONSOR AB THIRTY EIGHTY

02:54:45.508 --> 02:54:48.645 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

02:54:46.943 --> 02:54:50.347 region:rollup2
THE BILL IS CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO

PROVIDE.

02:54:53.083 --> 02:54:55.852 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION AND THE BILL

02:54:54.351 --> 02:54:56.419 region:rollup2
WOULD DO THREE THINGS

02:54:55.852 --> 02:54:58.321 region:rollup2
FIRST IT WOULD SET THE BASE

02:54:56.419 --> 02:55:00.023 region:rollup2
RATE.

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:03.026 region:rollup2
SECOND WOULD HEAR APPEALS AND

02:55:00.023 --> 02:55:04.494 region:rollup2
THIRD SET A GLOBAL BUDGETS.

02:55:03.026 --> 02:55:06.396 region:rollup2
FIRST THE COMMISSION WITHOUT THE

02:55:04.494 --> 02:55:08.064 region:rollup2
BASE RATE FOR DOCTORS HOSPITALS

02:55:06.396 --> 02:55:09.799 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH PLANS USING MEDICARE

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:12.002 region:rollup2
AS A BENCHMARK.

02:55:09.799 --> 02:55:13.770 region:rollup2
WE CHOSE MEDICARE BECAUSE IT IS

02:55:12.002 --> 02:55:15.672 region:rollup2
A TRIED AND TRUE PROCESS FOR

02:55:13.770 --> 02:55:17.440 region:rollup2
SETTING FARE RATES THAT ARE

02:55:15.672 --> 02:55:18.975 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT TO EVERYONE.

02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:20.076 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY MEDICARE

02:55:18.975 --> 02:55:21.845 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ALLOW THE RELATIVE

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:24.714 region:rollup2
MARKET POWER OF MAJOR HEALTH

02:55:21.845 --> 02:55:26.750 region:rollup2
CARE PLAYERS TO DICTATE PRICES.

02:55:24.714 --> 02:55:28.251 region:rollup2
FOR STATE LICENSED HEALTH PLANS

02:55:26.750 --> 02:55:29.552 region:rollup2

EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUAL

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:33.656 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS. THE BILL WOULD USE

02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:35.592 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE AS THE BASIS

02:55:33.656 --> 02:55:37.160 region:rollup2
FOR PREMIUMS.

02:55:35.592 --> 02:55:38.928 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS ARE

02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:39.929 region:rollup2
PRIVATE MEDICARE PLANS LIKE THE

02:55:38.928 --> 02:55:42.465 region:rollup2
ONES OFFERED BY KAISER AND

02:55:39.929 --> 02:55:43.533 region:rollup2
HEALTH NUTS.

02:55:42.465 --> 02:55:44.868 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN DOES NOT

A DO MANAGED CARE OR VALUE BASED

02:55:44.868 --> 02:55:48.271 region:rollup2
PURCHASING.

02:55:46.636 --> 02:55:50.440 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS WOULD

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:51.808 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT

02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:53.309 region:rollup2
WITH ONE ANOTHER AND HEALTH

02:55:51.808 --> 02:55:54.711 region:rollup2
PLANS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO

02:55:53.309 --> 02:55:56.479 region:rollup2
HAVE ENOUGH DOCTORS AND

02:55:54.711 --> 02:55:58.281 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND THEIR NETWORKS TO

02:55:56.479 --> 02:56:00.450 region:rollup2
GUARANTEE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE.

02:55:58.281 --> 02:56:02.252 region:rollup2
LAW AS THEY DO TODAY.

02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:04.087 region:rollup2
THE RATE PAID TO HEALTH PLANS

02:56:02.252 --> 02:56:05.922 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ADJUSTED BY AGE. RISK

02:56:04.087 --> 02:56:07.690 region:rollup2
LEX AND OTHER PERMISSIBLE RATING

02:56:05.922 --> 02:56:09.092 region:rollup2
FACTORS BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THEIR

02:56:07.690 --> 02:56:10.226 region:rollup2
THIRTIES USE LESS HEALTH CARE

02:56:09.092 --> 02:56:12.495 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR SEVENTIES

02:56:10.226 --> 02:56:13.897 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTIES.

02:56:12.495 --> 02:56:16.099 region:rollup2
FOR DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS TO

02:56:13.897 --> 02:56:16.866 region:rollup2
PROVIDE CARE OUTSIDE OF THE

CONTRACT WITH THE STATE LICENSE

02:56:16.866 --> 02:56:20.136 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN THE BASE RATE WILL

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:21.971 region:rollup2
BE BASED ON WHAT MEDICARE PAYS

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:22.505 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WITH ONE HUNDRED

02:56:21.971 --> 02:56:23.907 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF MEDICARE AS THE

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:25.041 region:rollup2
FLOOR.

02:56:23.907 --> 02:56:26.843 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD APPLY TO OUT OF

02:56:25.041 --> 02:56:28.344 region:rollup2
NETWORK CAREAS WELL AS THE CARE

02:56:26.843 --> 02:56:30.146 region:rollup2

OPERATING COSTS.

02:56:51.968 --> 02:56:55.104 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION MUST REVEAL

02:56:52.669 --> 02:56:56.406 region:rollup2

THE WAITRESS OR TO THE CHEF.

03:05:05.561 --> 03:05:08.064 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CHANGE THE EXPENSES

03:05:06.929 --> 03:05:09.799 region:rollup2
OCCURRED BY THAT RESTAURANT

03:05:08.064 --> 03:05:10.833 region:rollup2
OWNER.

03:05:09.799 --> 03:05:13.269 region:rollup2
HE SIMPLY IS LEFT WITH HALF THE

03:05:10.833 --> 03:05:15.004 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

03:05:13.269 --> 03:05:17.440 region:rollup2
THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS

03:05:15.004 --> 03:05:19.108 region:rollup2
THE ONLY CAPS THE PRICES PAID.

03:05:17.440 --> 03:05:19.809 region:rollup2
TO DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS AND

03:05:19.108 --> 03:05:22.311 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS AND

03:05:19.809 --> 03:05:23.212 region:rollup2
OTHERS AND HEALTH PLANS.

03:05:22.311 --> 03:05:25.114 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE

03:05:23.212 --> 03:05:26.415 region:rollup2
IN THE UNITED STATES

03:05:25.114 --> 03:05:27.350 region:rollup2
SINCE THE NIXON WAGE AND PRICE

03:05:26.415 --> 03:05:28.884 region:rollup2
CONTROLS OF THE NINETEEN

03:05:27.350 --> 03:05:30.119 region:rollup2
SEVENTIES.

03:05:28.884 --> 03:05:32.655 region:rollup2
AND FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS

03:05:30.119 --> 03:05:35.224 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL. IS ANYTHING LIKE THE

03:05:32.655 --> 03:05:36.626 region:rollup2
RATE SETTING SYSTEM IN MARYLAND

03:05:35.224 --> 03:05:38.194 region:rollup2
HAVING SERVED NINE YEARS AS THE

03:05:36.626 --> 03:05:40.062 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT CEO OF THE MARYLAND

03:05:38.194 --> 03:05:41.697 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. I'M HERE

03:05:40.062 --> 03:05:43.099 region:rollup2
TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS NOT AT

03:05:41.697 --> 03:05:44.834 region:rollup2
ALL THE CASE NOTHING COULD BE

03:05:43.099 --> 03:05:45.868 region:rollup2
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

03:05:44.834 --> 03:05:47.803 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO

03:05:45.868 --> 03:05:49.405 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING DRIVERS

03:05:47.803 --> 03:05:51.507 region:rollup2
OF HEALTH CARE COSTS NOR DOES IT

03:05:49.405 --> 03:05:53.943 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGED. AND SEPARATE

03:05:51.507 --> 03:05:55.478 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SPENDING INCREASES

03:05:53.943 --> 03:05:57.913 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE SPENDING

03:05:55.478 --> 03:06:00.082 region:rollup2
INCREASES THAT WE ARE INCURRING.

03:05:57.913 --> 03:06:02.118 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD IT'S THE RESULT OF

03:06:00.082 --> 03:06:03.919 region:rollup2
HAVING COVERED MILLIONS MORE

03:06:02.118 --> 03:06:05.554 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS UNDER THE

03:06:03.919 --> 03:06:08.024 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HEALTH CARE

03:06:05.554 --> 03:06:09.725 region:rollup2
SPENDING SOME IS REALLY

03:06:08.024 --> 03:06:11.093 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT REALLY GOOD AND WE

03:06:09.725 --> 03:06:12.662 region:rollup2
SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE

03:06:11.093 --> 03:06:14.497 region:rollup2
IMPACT OF THIS BILL.

03:06:12.662 --> 03:06:15.698 region:rollup2
IT IS UNPRECEDENTED.

03:06:14.497 --> 03:06:17.199 region:rollup2
FOR HOSPITALS THAT WOULD RESULT

03:06:15.698 --> 03:06:18.801 region:rollup2
IN A KIND OF EIGHTEEN BILLION

03:06:17.199 --> 03:06:20.369 region:rollup2
DOLLARS A YEAR.

03:06:18.801 --> 03:06:21.737 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF HOSPITALS IN

03:06:20.369 --> 03:06:24.740 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

03:06:21.737 --> 03:06:27.276 region:rollup2
OPERATING IN THE RED AT A LOSS.

03:06:24.740 --> 03:06:29.178 region:rollup2
THAT IS DOUBLE THE NUMBER TODAY.

03:06:27.276 --> 03:06:30.780 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT HOSPITALS WILL

03:06:29.178 --> 03:06:31.580 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

03:06:30.780 --> 03:06:33.416 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:34.283 region:rollup2
SINCERELY I'VE SPENT THIRTY

03:06:33.416 --> 03:06:37.486 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THE HOSPITAL

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:39.722 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION. AREA OF WORK.

03:06:37.486 --> 03:06:41.290 region:rollup2
I HAVE NEVER.

03:06:39.722 --> 03:06:42.792 region:rollup2
THREATEN HOSPITAL CLOSURES I'M

03:06:41.290 --> 03:06:44.794 region:rollup2
HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE

03:06:42.792 --> 03:06:46.595 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS ORDER

03:06:44.794 --> 03:06:47.630 region:rollup2
OF MAGNITUDE WOULD RESULT IN

03:06:46.595 --> 03:06:49.565 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL CLOSURES IN THE STATE

03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:51.400 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION AND

03:06:49.565 --> 03:06:54.904 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANT A HUNDRED AND

03:06:51.400 --> 03:06:55.871 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS LOST.

03:06:54.904 --> 03:06:57.039 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE

03:06:55.871 --> 03:06:59.175 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT

03:06:57.039 --> 03:07:01.944 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN WHY IS THAT. ON WE DID

03:06:59.175 --> 03:07:03.279 region:rollup2
BRING A CHART TO HELP EXPLAIN.

03:07:01.944 --> 03:07:05.414 region:rollup2
IT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE IN

03:07:03.279 --> 03:07:06.716 region:rollup2
THAT CHART MEDICARE TODAY

03:07:05.414 --> 03:07:08.484 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CARE FOR PEOPLE OVER

03:07:06.716 --> 03:07:10.886 region:rollup2
THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE.

03:07:08.484 --> 03:07:13.756 region:rollup2
PAYS LESS THAN THE COST

03:07:10.886 --> 03:07:15.758 region:rollup2
OF CARING FOR A SENIOR. MEDICARE

03:07:13.756 --> 03:07:18.027 region:rollup2
PAYS TWENTY THREE PERCENT LESS

03:07:15.758 --> 03:07:20.362 region:rollup2
THAN THE COST OF CARING FOR A

03:07:18.027 --> 03:07:22.264 region:rollup2
SENIOR IN THE HOSPITAL MEDI CAL

03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:24.133 region:rollup2
PAYS THIRTY TWO PERCENT LESS

03:07:22.264 --> 03:07:25.634 region:rollup2
THAN THE COST.

03:07:24.133 --> 03:07:27.603 region:rollup2
TREATING A MEDI CAL PATIENT IN

03:07:25.634 --> 03:07:29.171 region:rollup2
THE HOSPITAL. AND YES

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:30.940 region:rollup2
THOSE COSTS

03:07:29.171 --> 03:07:33.509 region:rollup2
PURPOSELY SHIFTED BY GOVERNMENT

03:07:30.940 --> 03:07:35.377 region:rollup2
UNDER FUNDING ON TO PRIVATELY

03:07:33.509 --> 03:07:36.612 region:rollup2
INSURED INDIVIDUALS. MEANING THE

03:07:35.377 --> 03:07:39.248 region:rollup2
PRICES THE PRIVATELY INSURED

03:07:36.612 --> 03:07:41.317 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS PAY ARE HIGHER WHAT

03:07:39.248 --> 03:07:43.152 region:rollup2
WOULD THIS BILL DO. IT DOES NOT

03:07:41.317 --> 03:07:44.954 region:rollup2
FILL THE EMPTY BUCKET OF

03:07:43.152 --> 03:07:46.822 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IT DOES NOT FILL THE

03:07:44.954 --> 03:07:48.090 region:rollup2
EMPTY BUCKET OF MEDICAID ALL IT

03:07:46.822 --> 03:07:48.657 region:rollup2
DOES IS TAKE THAT PRIVATE

03:07:48.090 --> 03:07:50.993 region:rollup2
INSURED AMOUNT AND BRING IT

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:52.962 region:rollup2
DOWN.

03:07:50.993 --> 03:07:54.697 region:rollup2
YES WHAT THIS RED LINE SHOWS YOU

03:07:52.962 --> 03:07:55.798 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF RATES

03:07:54.697 --> 03:07:58.367 region:rollup2
WERE SET AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

03:07:55.798 --> 03:07:59.769 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE. IT

03:07:58.367 --> 03:08:01.971 region:rollup2
COULD BE MORE IT COULD BE LESS

03:07:59.769 --> 03:08:03.339 region:rollup2
IT IS SIMPLY UNCLEAR IN THE BILL

03:08:01.971 --> 03:08:04.373 region:rollup2
WE USED A FIGURE THAT WAS BEING

03:08:03.339 --> 03:08:05.574 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED AS THE BILL WAS

03:08:04.373 --> 03:08:07.510 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED AT A HUNDRED AND

03:08:05.574 --> 03:08:09.912 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE.

03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:11.113 region:rollup2
THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.

03:08:09.912 --> 03:08:13.482 region:rollup2
IT'S IS ALSO A PROBLEM BECAUSE

03:08:11.113 --> 03:08:15.317 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS STILL HAVE TO PAY THE

03:08:13.482 --> 03:08:16.719 region:rollup2
EXPLODING COSTS OF CARE LABOR.

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:18.721 region:rollup2
DRUGS

03:08:16.719 --> 03:08:20.289 region:rollup2
SURGICAL SUPPLIES EMERALD EYES

03:08:18.721 --> 03:08:22.691 region:rollup2
OTHER IMAGING EQUIPMENT I. T.

03:08:20.289 --> 03:08:24.827 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS AND THE ENORMOUS COST OF

03:08:22.691 --> 03:08:26.896 region:rollup2
BEING SEISMICALLY PREPARED

03:08:24.827 --> 03:08:28.464 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

03:08:26.896 --> 03:08:30.166 region:rollup2
IN THIS STATE.

03:08:28.464 --> 03:08:32.868 region:rollup2
THAT DOESN'T GO AWAY IF WE

03:08:30.166 --> 03:08:34.970 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PAY LOWER PRICES

03:08:32.868 --> 03:08:36.071 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS HAD TWO CHOICES SHORT

03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:38.307 region:rollup2
CHANGE PATIENT CARE.

03:08:36.071 --> 03:08:39.475 region:rollup2
THAT IS.

03:08:38.307 --> 03:08:41.577 region:rollup2
THERE LARGEST CHANGEABLE COST IS

03:08:39.475 --> 03:08:42.111 region:rollup2
NEXT.

03:08:41.577 --> 03:08:43.345 region:rollup2
AND THAT MEANS LAYING OFF

03:08:42.111 --> 03:08:44.847 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

03:08:43.345 --> 03:08:46.415 region:rollup2
OUR WORKERS COMPRISE MORE THAN

03:08:44.847 --> 03:08:47.983 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT OF A TYPICAL

03:08:46.415 --> 03:08:49.718 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S COST IT IS THE ONLY

03:08:47.983 --> 03:08:52.054 region:rollup2
CHOICE THAT THIS PRICE CAPPING

03:08:49.718 --> 03:08:53.489 region:rollup2
BILL ALLOWS. AND UNDER THIS BILL

03:08:52.054 --> 03:08:54.990 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WILL STILL BE STRAPPED

03:08:53.489 --> 03:08:56.625 region:rollup2
WITH OUT OF POCKET DRUG COSTS

03:08:54.990 --> 03:08:58.727 region:rollup2
AND OTHER COMMON OUT OF POCKET

03:08:56.625 --> 03:09:00.062 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EXPENSES.

03:08:58.727 --> 03:09:01.630 region:rollup2
NO MANY SAY THERE IS WIDESPREAD

03:09:00.062 --> 03:09:02.698 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT. THAT WE HAVE TO

03:09:01.630 --> 03:09:04.533 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE

03:09:02.698 --> 03:09:06.435 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE

03:09:04.533 --> 03:09:07.937 region:rollup2
IT'S GOT TO BE ADDRESSED AND THE

03:09:06.435 --> 03:09:09.772 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS WE SHOULD LOOK TO

03:09:07.937 --> 03:09:11.941 region:rollup2
SHOULD NOT COMPROMISE EITHER THE

03:09:09.772 --> 03:09:13.943 region:rollup2
QUALITY OR AVAILABILITY. OF CARE

03:09:11.941 --> 03:09:15.644 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY EIGHTY

03:09:13.943 --> 03:09:16.779 region:rollup2
SEVEN IS A FLAWED APPROACH FOR

03:09:15.644 --> 03:09:18.113 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

03:09:16.779 --> 03:09:19.381 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

03:09:18.113 --> 03:09:20.382 region:rollup2
I WILL SAY THAT THE CALIFORNIA

03:09:19.381 --> 03:09:21.617 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION STANDS

03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:24.019 region:rollup2
READY.

03:09:21.617 --> 03:09:25.421 region:rollup2
PLAY A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS

03:09:24.019 --> 03:09:26.689 region:rollup2

MORE AFFORDABLE IN THE STATE OF

03:09:26.689 --> 03:09:31.727 region:rollup2

COMPLEX PROBLEM. IDENTIFY

03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:37.700 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND MOVE WITH ALACRITY

03:09:36.332 --> 03:09:38.868 region:rollup2
IN THAT DIRECTION WITHOUT

03:09:37.700 --> 03:09:40.569 region:rollup2
COMPROMISING THE CARE FOR

03:09:38.868 --> 03:09:41.470 region:rollup2
MILLIONS.

SIGNIFICANT UNINTENDED QUANT

BECOME LAW.

03:10:46.368 --> 03:10:49.905 region:rollup2
IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE

WELL RECENT COVERAGE GAINES

03:11:12.394 --> 03:11:15.698 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CELEBRATED.

03:11:14.096 --> 03:11:17.032 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PERSISTS IN BEING

03:11:15.698 --> 03:11:18.200 region:rollup2
AMONGST THE WORST STATES WHEN

03:11:17.032 --> 03:11:19.635 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO MEDI CAL

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:21.337 region:rollup2
PROVIDER RATES.

03:11:19.635 --> 03:11:22.538 region:rollup2
PAYING RATES WELL BELOW THE COST

MORE ADMINISTRATIVE TIME THAN

MOST OTHER PAYERS.

03:11:28.143 --> 03:11:31.680 region:rollup2
THIS RESULTS IN MANY PHYSICIANS

03:11:29.678 --> 03:11:34.083 region:rollup2
CHOOSING NOT TO SEE MANY. OR IN

03:11:31.680 --> 03:11:36.251 region:rollup2
FACT ANY MEDI CAL PATIENTS.

03:11:34.083 --> 03:11:37.987 region:rollup2
AND THE STATE SHIFTING COSTS FOR

03:11:36.251 --> 03:11:38.954 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ON TO THE

03:11:37.987 --> 03:11:40.856 region:rollup2
PURCHASERS OF COMMERCIAL

03:11:38.954 --> 03:11:42.157 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

03:11:40.856 --> 03:11:43.759 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN WILL

03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:44.893 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE ACCESS PROBLEMS THAT

03:11:43.759 --> 03:11:46.328 region:rollup2
DOES NOTHING TO CORRECT THE

03:11:44.893 --> 03:11:48.330 region:rollup2
UNFAIR LOW FEE SCHEDULE FOR MEDI

03:11:46.328 --> 03:11:49.732 region:rollup2

03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:52.101 region:rollup2
NEARLY UNCHANGED IN THE THIRTY

03:11:49.732 --> 03:11:53.435 region:rollup2
YEARS I'VE PRACTICED.

03:11:52.101 --> 03:11:54.937 region:rollup2
BY RATE SETTING ONLY COMMERCIAL

PRODUCTS AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN

03:11:54.937 --> 03:11:57.172 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR

THOSE STILL WANTING TO SEE MEDI

03:11:57.172 --> 03:12:01.176 region:rollup2

03:11:58.941 --> 03:12:02.644 region:rollup2

03:12:01.176 --> 03:12:04.013 region:rollup2
NOTHING IN THIS BILL MEANING

03:12:02.644 --> 03:12:05.781 region:rollup2
FULLY ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF

03:12:04.013 --> 03:12:07.249 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL RATHER. IGNORING THE

03:12:05.781 --> 03:12:08.617 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ISSUES WHILE IMPOSING

03:12:07.249 --> 03:12:10.786 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATE CUTS BASED ON

03:12:08.617 --> 03:12:12.321 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WILL MAKE ALREADY POOR

03:12:10.786 --> 03:12:13.422 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND EVEN

03:12:12.321 --> 03:12:16.358 region:rollup2

BENEFICIARIES. EVEN WORSE.

03:12:16.358 --> 03:12:18.727 region:rollup2
IT IS OUR STRONG BELIEF THAT

03:12:17.593 --> 03:12:20.062 region:rollup2
PASSAGE OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:22.297 region:rollup2

03:12:20.062 --> 03:12:24.032 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE OF PHYSICIANS.

03:12:22.297 --> 03:12:25.968 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS MUCH TO OFFER IN

03:12:24.032 --> 03:12:27.503 region:rollup2
TERMS OF CLIMATE AND ACTIVITIES.

03:12:25.968 --> 03:12:29.104 region:rollup2
BUT NOT AT THE COST OF BEING

03:12:27.503 --> 03:12:30.806 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO PAY BACK LOANS

03:12:29.104 --> 03:12:31.640 region:rollup2
PURCHASE NEEDED EQUIPMENT. AND

03:12:30.806 --> 03:12:33.609 region:rollup2
REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE IN

03:12:31.640 --> 03:12:35.077 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

03:12:33.609 --> 03:12:37.479 region:rollup2
THIS WILL IMPACT POSITIONS IN

03:12:35.077 --> 03:12:38.514 region:rollup2
ALL SIZES A PRACTICE.

03:12:37.479 --> 03:12:39.748 region:rollup2
PROPONENTS SAY THAT U. S.

03:12:38.514 --> 03:12:41.850 region:rollup2
POSITIONS GET PAID MORE THAN

03:12:39.748 --> 03:12:42.718 region:rollup2
THEIR EUROPEAN COUNTERPARTS.

03:12:41.850 --> 03:12:44.486 region:rollup2
BUT THEY FAILED TO POINT OUT THE

03:12:42.718 --> 03:12:46.288 region:rollup2
PUBLIC POLICY REGION REASONS FOR

03:12:44.486 --> 03:12:47.823 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SELF.

03:12:46.288 --> 03:12:49.158 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA EXPECTS POSITIONS TO

SELF FINANCE THEIR COLLEGE IN

03:12:49.158 --> 03:12:52.361 region:rollup2
MEDICAL EDUCATION.

03:12:50.859 --> 03:12:54.129 region:rollup2
LEAVING MEDICAL SCHOOL GRADUATES

03:12:52.361 --> 03:12:54.763 region:rollup2
TO GRADUATE WITH HUNDREDS OF

THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF PERSONAL

03:12:56.398 --> 03:12:59.601 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS UNLIKE IN THE

03:12:57.833 --> 03:13:00.969 region:rollup2
EUROPEAN NO FAULT SYSTEM MUST

SELF FINANCE THEIR LIABILITY

03:13:02.404 --> 03:13:05.607 region:rollup2
STATE TOPPING FIFTY THOUSAND

03:13:03.705 --> 03:13:07.342 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

03:13:05.607 --> 03:13:09.178 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE NEARLY

03:13:07.342 --> 03:13:10.612 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THAT OF EUROPEAN SYSTEMS.

03:13:09.178 --> 03:13:12.047 region:rollup2
AND PHYSICIANS NOW SPENT TWENTY

03:13:10.612 --> 03:13:13.482 region:rollup2
FIVE TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THEIR

03:13:12.047 --> 03:13:15.951 region:rollup2

ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS.

03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:19.188 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN FACT HAS THE

03:13:17.252 --> 03:13:21.457 region:rollup2
HIGHEST COST TO PRACTICE

03:13:19.188 --> 03:13:23.192 region:rollup2
MEDICINE IN THE ENTIRE NATION.

03:13:21.457 --> 03:13:23.992 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN DOES

03:13:23.192 --> 03:13:26.028 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO ADDRESS THESE

03:13:33.335 --> 03:13:37.072 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA POSITIONS ARE ALREADY

03:13:34.803 --> 03:13:38.607 region:rollup2
LEAN AND EFFICIENT.

03:13:37.072 --> 03:13:40.109 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS

POINT FIVE PERCENT PER YEAR THE

03:13:45.581 --> 03:13:50.252 region:rollup2
LOWEST IN THE ENTIRE NATION.

03:13:48.517 --> 03:13:51.220 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY THAT

03:13:50.252 --> 03:13:52.855 region:rollup2
MANY PHYSICIANS WOULD

03:13:51.220 --> 03:13:54.656 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY LEAVE THE STATE.

03:13:52.855 --> 03:13:55.724 region:rollup2
OR RETIRE EARLY.

03:13:54.656 --> 03:13:57.593 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD CLEARLY STRUGGLE TO

03:13:55.724 --> 03:13:58.193 region:rollup2
RECRUIT THE NEXT GENERATION OF

03:13:57.593 --> 03:13:59.728 region:rollup2

HERE.

03:13:59.728 --> 03:14:03.031 region:rollup2
FINALLY WE DO NOT HAVE FAITH

03:14:01.530 --> 03:14:04.066 region:rollup2
THAT ELEVEN POLITICAL APPOINTEES

03:14:03.031 --> 03:14:05.367 region:rollup2
WILL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY

03:14:04.066 --> 03:14:07.002 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE RATES OF OVER A

HUNDRED THOUSAND POSITIONS.

03:14:07.002 --> 03:14:10.572 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT WOULD ENSURE OUR

03:14:08.537 --> 03:14:11.473 region:rollup2
PRACTICES WOULD REMAIN VIABLE.

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:13.575 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL FOR DISASTER HERE IS

03:14:11.473 --> 03:14:14.710 region:rollup2
IMMENSE.

03:14:13.575 --> 03:14:16.145 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY MORE CONCERNS AND

03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:17.379 region:rollup2

THE OPPOSITION IS DEFENDING A

03:23:13.882 --> 03:23:18.319 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW IS BROKEN.

03:23:16.851 --> 03:23:20.955 region:rollup2
IT IS BROKEN FOR WORKERS FOR

03:23:18.319 --> 03:23:22.724 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS FOR GOVERNMENT AND FOR

03:23:20.955 --> 03:23:24.392 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

03:23:22.724 --> 03:23:25.760 region:rollup2
MOST OF ALL IT'S BROKEN FOR

03:23:24.392 --> 03:23:27.729 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE A

03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:30.398 region:rollup2
SHORTAGE OF PROVIDERS WHO HAVE A

03:23:27.729 --> 03:23:32.567 region:rollup2
LACK OF ACCESS FOR RURAL AREAS.

03:23:30.398 --> 03:23:34.069 region:rollup2
AND IT IS BROKEN FOR MEDI CAL

PATIENTS

03:23:34.069 --> 03:23:37.839 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL PROVIDERS.

03:23:36.538 --> 03:23:40.141 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PUNISHING

03:23:37.839 --> 03:23:41.876 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AT ITS CORE IT IS

03:23:40.141 --> 03:23:43.344 region:rollup2
ABOUT ACCESS

03:23:41.876 --> 03:23:45.747 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ABOUT ADDRESSING THE

03:23:43.344 --> 03:23:47.782 region:rollup2
INEQUITIES IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM

03:23:45.747 --> 03:23:48.717 region:rollup2
THAT LEAD TO A LACK OF ACCESS.

03:23:47.782 --> 03:23:50.819 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THE NAME OF THE

03:23:48.717 --> 03:23:53.054 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS THAT COMMISSION ON

03:23:50.819 --> 03:23:55.690 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE COST QUALITY IN

03:23:53.054 --> 03:23:56.825 region:rollup2
EQUITY YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THEM.

03:23:55.690 --> 03:23:58.593 region:rollup2
I WANT TO START OFF BY

03:23:56.825 --> 03:24:01.196 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE.

03:23:58.593 --> 03:24:03.565 region:rollup2
CHART THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP.

03:24:01.196 --> 03:24:04.532 region:rollup2
WHICH TIES INTO THE ISSUE OF

03:24:03.565 --> 03:24:06.234 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT AND

03:24:04.532 --> 03:24:08.837 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

03:24:06.234 --> 03:24:10.038 region:rollup2
A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF EVIDENCE

03:24:08.837 --> 03:24:11.940 region:rollup2
SHOWS THAT PROVIDERS THAT

03:24:10.038 --> 03:24:14.109 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATELY SERVE LOW

03:24:11.940 --> 03:24:15.610 region:rollup2
INCOME AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS

03:24:14.109 --> 03:24:17.679 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL AND MEDICARE

03:24:15.610 --> 03:24:19.914 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

03:24:17.679 --> 03:24:21.382 region:rollup2
CHARGE LOWER PRICES TO PRIVATE

03:24:19.914 --> 03:24:23.118 region:rollup2
PAYERS

03:24:21.382 --> 03:24:24.552 region:rollup2
IN FACT A TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY

03:24:23.118 --> 03:24:26.287 region:rollup2
THAT FOUND THAT FOR EVERY

03:24:24.552 --> 03:24:28.590 region:rollup2
PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE

03:24:26.287 --> 03:24:30.859 region:rollup2
MEDICAID POPULATION SO THE MEDI

03:24:28.590 --> 03:24:33.061 region:rollup2
CAL POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA THE

03:24:30.859 --> 03:24:36.097 region:rollup2
AVERAGE HOSPITAL CHARGE TO

03:24:33.061 --> 03:24:37.665 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PAYERS DECREASED BY ONE

03:24:36.097 --> 03:24:39.901 region:rollup2
POINT TWO PERCENT WHICH IS A

03:24:37.665 --> 03:24:41.669 region:rollup2
DROP OF ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS.

03:24:39.901 --> 03:24:43.638 region:rollup2
NOT INCREASE DECREASE.

03:24:41.669 --> 03:24:45.140 region:rollup2
AND WHY.

03:24:43.638 --> 03:24:47.775 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PROVIDERS WITH HIGH MEDI

03:24:45.140 --> 03:24:49.744 region:rollup2
CAL AND MEDICARE POPULATIONS ARE

03:24:47.775 --> 03:24:52.180 region:rollup2
MORE EFFICIENT AND COST

03:24:49.744 --> 03:24:54.415 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE. IN OTHER WORDS THEY

03:24:52.180 --> 03:24:57.085 region:rollup2
DO MORE WITH LESS

03:24:54.415 --> 03:24:59.287 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE NOT IMMUTABLE.

03:24:57.085 --> 03:25:00.555 region:rollup2
IN FACT MED PAC WHICH IS THE

03:24:59.287 --> 03:25:02.357 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY

03:25:00.555 --> 03:25:04.125 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WHICH ADVISES

03:25:02.357 --> 03:25:06.261 region:rollup2
CONGRESS ON MEDICARE.

03:25:04.125 --> 03:25:07.495 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT IN A QUOTE WHEN A

03:25:06.261 --> 03:25:09.764 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL RECEIVES HIGHER

03:25:07.495 --> 03:25:11.232 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FROM COMMERCIAL PAYERS

03:25:09.764 --> 03:25:13.501 region:rollup2
THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THE

03:25:11.232 --> 03:25:16.037 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S LOWER. IT THEREFORE

03:25:13.501 --> 03:25:18.640 region:rollup2
HAS LESS INCENTIVE

03:25:16.037 --> 03:25:20.341 region:rollup2
KEEP ITS COSTS LOW.

03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:21.609 region:rollup2
ON THE FLIPSIDE MED PAC HAS ALSO

03:25:20.341 --> 03:25:23.611 region:rollup2
SHOWN THE PROVIDERS UNDER

03:25:21.609 --> 03:25:25.480 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PRESSURE WHO RESEARCH

03:25:23.611 --> 03:25:27.415 region:rollup2
RECEIVE LOWER COMMERCIAL RE

03:25:25.480 --> 03:25:30.285 region:rollup2
EMBRACE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE ABLE

03:25:27.415 --> 03:25:32.520 region:rollup2
TO RESTRAIN THEIR COSTS.

03:25:30.285 --> 03:25:34.956 region:rollup2
HI COMMERCIAL PRICES.

03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:36.591 region:rollup2
ARE NOT CORRELATED WITH SERVING

03:25:34.956 --> 03:25:38.827 region:rollup2
LARGE POPULATIONS OF MEDI CAL

03:25:36.591 --> 03:25:41.296 region:rollup2
ARE MEDICARE THEY ARE CORRELATED

03:25:38.827 --> 03:25:42.797 region:rollup2
WITH HAVING MONOPOLY POWER.

03:25:41.296 --> 03:25:44.532 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE IN IN AN AREA WHERE

03:25:42.797 --> 03:25:46.768 region:rollup2
YOU CAN COMMAND HIGHER PRICES

03:25:44.532 --> 03:25:47.869 region:rollup2
THEN YOU WILL. YOU WILL HAVE

03:25:46.768 --> 03:25:49.837 region:rollup2
HIGHER COMMERCIAL PRICES

03:25:47.869 --> 03:25:52.340 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF YOU SERVE A SINGLE

03:25:49.837 --> 03:25:54.242 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL IN RELIEF OR NOT.

03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:55.810 region:rollup2
AND WHY. BECAUSE WE LET THEM

03:25:54.242 --> 03:25:57.579 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL MARKET IS

03:25:55.810 --> 03:25:59.380 region:rollup2
FRAGMENTED OPAQUE AND DRIVEN BY

03:25:57.579 --> 03:26:00.882 region:rollup2
PROFIT.

03:25:59.380 --> 03:26:02.817 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY EIGHTY SEVEN SIX TO

03:26:00.882 --> 03:26:04.552 region:rollup2
REMEDY THE INEQUITIES THAT WE

03:26:02.817 --> 03:26:06.554 region:rollup2
HAVE IN OUR EXISTING BROKEN

03:26:04.552 --> 03:26:08.256 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BY TAKING IN ACCOUNT

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:10.091 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THAT SERVE MEDI CAL

03:26:08.256 --> 03:26:12.026 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS THAT ARE IN RURAL

03:26:10.091 --> 03:26:13.461 region:rollup2
AREAS THAT ARE IN UNDERSERVED

03:26:12.026 --> 03:26:15.463 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES. WHERE THERE ARE IT

03:26:13.461 --> 03:26:17.165 region:rollup2
IS A LACK OF ACCESS WHEN THEY

03:26:15.463 --> 03:26:19.534 region:rollup2
SAT BASE RATES?

03:26:17.165 --> 03:26:23.104 region:rollup2
THAT WILL CREATE A LINK A

03:26:19.534 --> 03:26:24.906 region:rollup2
REASONABLE LINK BETWEEN MEDI CAL

03:26:23.104 --> 03:26:27.642 region:rollup2

03:26:24.906 --> 03:26:28.810 region:rollup2
LINK THAT DOES NOT EXIST RIGHT

03:26:27.642 --> 03:26:30.945 region:rollup2
NOW. THIS BILL WILL BRING

FEW OF THE POINTS AND

03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:56.070 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY THE POINT SPACEY HA

03:26:54.335 --> 03:26:57.805 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL WOULD LEAD TO

WORKERS WE SEE THIS AS A THINLY

03:27:04.879 --> 03:27:07.749 region:rollup2
VEILED THREAT THE FACT OF THE

03:27:06.714 --> 03:27:09.484 region:rollup2

LETTING ARBITRARY MARKET FORCES

DECIDE THAT. DOCTORS AND

ABOUT VARIATION DID YOU KNOW

THAT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS THE

03:28:58.493 --> 03:29:03.664 region:rollup2

ARE BEING THROWN AT YOU THERE

ARE REAL REASONS AN IMPORTANT

03:29:15.543 --> 03:29:18.479 region:rollup2
REASONS FOR VARIATIONS IN COST.

03:29:17.845 --> 03:29:22.383 region:rollup2
AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS

03:29:18.479 --> 03:29:23.418 region:rollup2
AND PRICES.

03:29:22.383 --> 03:29:24.852 region:rollup2
THANK YOU I'LL TRY TO DO THIS

03:29:23.418 --> 03:29:26.087 region:rollup2
QUICKLY.

03:29:24.852 --> 03:29:28.089 region:rollup2
IT IS A BROKEN SYSTEM FOR

03:29:26.087 --> 03:29:29.857 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AS WELL WE RECOGNIZE

03:29:28.089 --> 03:29:30.291 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT TO SEE IT FIXED BUT

03:29:29.857 --> 03:29:31.826 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO SEE A FIX

03:29:30.291 --> 03:29:33.728 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLY.

03:29:31.826 --> 03:29:35.730 region:rollup2
WE ARE FOR TRANSPARENCY BUT WE

03:29:33.728 --> 03:29:37.932 region:rollup2
ARE NOT FOR PRICE FIXING THAT

03:29:35.730 --> 03:29:39.700 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DEAL WITH ACTUAL COSTS.

03:29:37.932 --> 03:29:41.536 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THIS BILL CONTAINS

03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:43.304 region:rollup2
GLOBAL CAPS

03:29:41.536 --> 03:29:44.472 region:rollup2
BELIES ANY ARGUMENT THAT IT

03:29:43.304 --> 03:29:46.140 region:rollup2
WOULD KEEP UP WITH THE ACTUAL

03:29:44.472 --> 03:29:47.642 region:rollup2
COST OF CARE.

03:29:46.140 --> 03:29:50.111 region:rollup2
IF CAPS HAVE TO BE REDUCED

03:29:47.642 --> 03:29:51.846 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE OVER EXPENDED. ON

03:29:50.111 --> 03:29:52.747 region:rollup2
NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES WHY

03:29:51.846 --> 03:29:54.282 region:rollup2
PUNISH THE PROVIDERS ON THE BACK

03:29:52.747 --> 03:29:56.217 region:rollup2
AND.

03:29:54.282 --> 03:29:57.819 region:rollup2
AND MAY I REMIND THE LEGISLATURE

03:29:56.217 --> 03:29:59.086 region:rollup2
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HAD

03:29:57.819 --> 03:30:00.087 region:rollup2
SIMILAR LANGUAGE ABOUT

03:29:59.086 --> 03:30:01.556 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE IN THE

03:30:00.087 --> 03:30:03.057 region:rollup2
PAST.

03:30:01.556 --> 03:30:04.692 region:rollup2
THIS BILL DOES NOT DEFINE WHAT

03:30:03.057 --> 03:30:05.993 region:rollup2
THAT PERCENT YES BUT THIS

03:30:04.692 --> 03:30:08.062 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS PLAYED WITH A

03:30:05.993 --> 03:30:10.097 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT IN S. B. FIVE IN

03:30:08.062 --> 03:30:11.666 region:rollup2
AB FIVE THIRTY THREE. AND A

03:30:10.097 --> 03:30:13.901 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

03:30:11.666 --> 03:30:15.603 region:rollup2
IN AB SEVENTY TWO FOR NON

03:30:13.901 --> 03:30:17.505 region:rollup2
CONTRACT PROVIDERS GIVING THE

03:30:15.603 --> 03:30:18.739 region:rollup2
BULK OF CARE IN THE EMERGENCY

03:30:17.505 --> 03:30:20.241 region:rollup2
ROOM WHEN THERE ARE NO

03:30:18.739 --> 03:30:21.509 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED PROVIDERS AVAILABLE.

03:30:20.241 --> 03:30:23.077 region:rollup2
WHY DO WE BELIEVE THAT THE

03:30:21.509 --> 03:30:24.112 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT LOOK AT A

03:30:23.077 --> 03:30:26.180 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

03:30:24.112 --> 03:30:27.448 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT WHICH IS WELL BELOW

03:30:26.180 --> 03:30:29.283 region:rollup2
THE COST OF CARE? ONE LAST

03:30:27.448 --> 03:30:30.151 region:rollup2
COMMENT

03:30:29.283 --> 03:30:32.820 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IN THE LAST TWENTY

03:30:30.151 --> 03:30:34.555 region:rollup2
YEARS HAS FALLEN WAY BELOW THE

03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:36.023 region:rollup2
ACTUAL INFLATION RATE.

03:30:34.555 --> 03:30:38.025 region:rollup2
IN WHAT IT PAYS POSITIONS IN

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:41.329 region:rollup2
THIS STATE AND NATION WIDE IT IS

03:30:38.025 --> 03:30:44.265 region:rollup2
NOT A GOOD. MARKER.

03:30:41.329 --> 03:30:44.732 region:rollup2
OKAY.

03:30:44.265 --> 03:30:44.999 region:rollup2
NOW QUESTIONS FROM THE

03:30:44.732 --> 03:30:47.268 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

03:30:44.999 --> 03:30:48.970 region:rollup2
SO

03:30:47.268 --> 03:30:50.505 region:rollup2
STERN BANKS I THINK AS CHAIR. I

03:30:48.970 --> 03:30:51.806 region:rollup2
WAS KALRA WHAT BOB AND I WANT TO

03:30:50.505 --> 03:30:52.874 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE EFFORT IN TEND

03:30:51.806 --> 03:30:54.408 region:rollup2
TO THIS BILL.

03:30:52.874 --> 03:30:56.444 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS.

03:30:54.408 --> 03:30:57.612 region:rollup2
ON AFFORDABILITY IN OUR

03:30:56.444 --> 03:30:58.946 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

03:30:57.612 --> 03:31:00.548 region:rollup2
AND HOWEVER SICK COME AS NO

03:30:58.946 --> 03:31:02.049 region:rollup2
SURPRISE THAT I'M I DON'T

03:31:00.548 --> 03:31:03.584 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH

03:31:02.049 --> 03:31:05.786 region:rollup2
IS TO COST CONTAINMENT.

03:31:03.584 --> 03:31:07.488 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK THAT GOVERNMENT

03:31:05.786 --> 03:31:09.056 region:rollup2
PRICE SETTING IS THE BEST

03:31:07.488 --> 03:31:10.525 region:rollup2
THE BEST APPROACH AND WE'VE

03:31:09.056 --> 03:31:11.359 region:rollup2
HEARD SOME OF THAT IN. AMONGST

03:31:10.525 --> 03:31:13.094 region:rollup2
THE WITNESSES TODAY DO HAVE A

03:31:11.359 --> 03:31:15.463 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

03:31:13.094 --> 03:31:17.031 region:rollup2
A FOR YOU IF THAT'S OKAY.

03:31:15.463 --> 03:31:18.633 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS WELL KNOWN AS A SOME

03:31:17.031 --> 03:31:19.901 region:rollup2
THE WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT ABOUT

03:31:18.633 --> 03:31:21.502 region:rollup2
COST SHIFTING IN HEALTH CARE AS

03:31:19.901 --> 03:31:23.204 region:rollup2
A RESULT OF LOW REIMBURSEMENT

03:31:21.502 --> 03:31:24.539 region:rollup2
RATES IN IN MEDI CAL. A FOR

03:31:23.204 --> 03:31:26.007 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT HAVE A LARGE

03:31:24.539 --> 03:31:27.775 region:rollup2
SHARE OF MEDI CAL PATIENTS

03:31:26.007 --> 03:31:29.310 region:rollup2
AND I CAN THINK OF A HANDFUL OF

03:31:27.775 --> 03:31:30.645 region:rollup2
THEM BOUT WITH IN THE INLAND

03:31:29.310 --> 03:31:31.679 region:rollup2
EMPIRE WHERE I REPRESENT.

03:31:30.645 --> 03:31:33.447 region:rollup2
I'M HOW WOULD THEY MAKE ENDS

03:31:31.679 --> 03:31:34.482 region:rollup2
MEET IF THEY FURTHER SQUEEZE

03:31:33.447 --> 03:31:35.950 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FROM PRIVATE PAY

03:31:34.482 --> 03:31:37.718 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:39.453 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO BE UNWORKABLE.

03:31:37.718 --> 03:31:40.721 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND

03:31:39.453 --> 03:31:42.990 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS FIRST OF ALL

03:31:40.721 --> 03:31:44.859 region:rollup2
THERE'S A. A FALSE PRESUMPTION

03:31:42.990 --> 03:31:46.394 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN PUT FORTH THAT THOSE

03:31:44.859 --> 03:31:48.763 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TAKING ON MORE MEDI CAL

03:31:46.394 --> 03:31:50.898 region:rollup2
AND MEDICARE PATIENTS ARE BARB

03:31:48.763 --> 03:31:53.267 region:rollup2
DOING IT SIMPLY BY. INCREASING

03:31:50.898 --> 03:31:53.834 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES THE REALITY IS

03:31:53.267 --> 03:31:54.635 region:rollup2
THAT THE FACTS DON'T DICTATE

03:31:53.834 --> 03:31:55.903 region:rollup2
THAT

03:31:54.635 --> 03:31:57.972 region:rollup2
THE FACTS ACCEDED TO THAT THOSE

03:31:55.903 --> 03:31:59.774 region:rollup2
THAT TAKE MORE MEDI CAL.

03:31:57.972 --> 03:32:01.509 region:rollup2
AND MEDICARE PATIENTS ACTUALLY

03:31:59.774 --> 03:32:03.177 region:rollup2
GET A LOWER COMMERCIAL RATE WHAT

03:32:01.509 --> 03:32:04.679 region:rollup2
IS DRIVING THE COMMERCIAL RATES

03:32:03.177 --> 03:32:06.714 region:rollup2
IS NOT THAT THEY'RE ALL TAKING

03:32:04.679 --> 03:32:08.883 region:rollup2
CARE. OF THOSE THAT ARE ON MEDI

03:32:06.714 --> 03:32:10.151 region:rollup2
CAL BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS

03:32:08.883 --> 03:32:11.385 region:rollup2
THAT IN THIS BILL WE DO HAVE THE

03:32:10.151 --> 03:32:13.888 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY.

03:32:11.385 --> 03:32:15.323 region:rollup2
AND IT'S INCLUDED NOT ONLY.

03:32:13.888 --> 03:32:16.757 region:rollup2
IN THE ORIGINAL.

03:32:15.323 --> 03:32:18.626 region:rollup2
BUT DROPPED IN THE AMENDED

03:32:16.757 --> 03:32:20.561 region:rollup2
DRAFT BUT ALSO IN.

03:32:18.626 --> 03:32:22.563 region:rollup2
IN MY ACCEPTING THE POLICY

03:32:20.561 --> 03:32:24.131 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE CHAIR

03:32:22.563 --> 03:32:27.902 region:rollup2
AND THE STAFF AND THE STAFF.

03:32:24.131 --> 03:32:30.972 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO MAKE

03:32:27.902 --> 03:32:33.140 region:rollup2
UP FOR THOSE CLINICS HOSPITALS

03:32:30.972 --> 03:32:35.710 region:rollup2
DOCTORS THAT TAKE. MORE MEDI CAL

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:37.144 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND WE DO THAT BY JUST

03:32:35.710 --> 03:32:39.113 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMERCIAL RATE IN A WAY

03:32:37.144 --> 03:32:40.781 region:rollup2
THAT REWARDS THEM. REWARDS THEM

03:32:39.113 --> 03:32:42.583 region:rollup2
FOR TAKING CARE OF THE MOST

03:32:40.781 --> 03:32:43.718 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE AND

03:32:42.583 --> 03:32:45.086 region:rollup2
REWARDS THEM.

03:32:43.718 --> 03:32:46.921 region:rollup2
FOR ACTUALLY DOING A PUBLIC

03:32:45.086 --> 03:32:49.357 region:rollup2
SERVICE THE REALITY IS IF IT

03:32:46.921 --> 03:32:50.891 region:rollup2
WERE TRUE IF IT WERE TRUE THAT

03:32:49.357 --> 03:32:52.426 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT TOOK ON MORE MEDI CAL

03:32:50.891 --> 03:32:53.594 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WERE BEING COMPENSATED

03:32:52.426 --> 03:32:54.962 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY BY COMMERCIAL

03:32:53.594 --> 03:32:55.863 region:rollup2
RATES AND WE DON'T WANT TO MESS

03:32:54.962 --> 03:32:57.531 region:rollup2
WITH THE COMMERCIALLY BECAUSE OF

03:32:55.863 --> 03:32:59.367 region:rollup2
IT. THEN IN SO MANY RULE

03:32:57.531 --> 03:33:01.402 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY HAVE AN

03:32:59.367 --> 03:33:02.670 region:rollup2
EXCESS OF MEDICAL RATES THEN

03:33:01.402 --> 03:33:04.605 region:rollup2
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DOCTORS BEING

03:33:02.670 --> 03:33:05.806 region:rollup2
PAID LESS THAN DOCTORS AND OTHER

03:33:04.605 --> 03:33:07.742 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ON THE COMMERCIAL

03:33:05.806 --> 03:33:08.976 region:rollup2
RATES AND IN FACT. IN MANY RURAL

03:33:07.742 --> 03:33:10.311 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES DOCTORS OF GETTING

03:33:08.976 --> 03:33:11.946 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES EVEN BELOW

03:33:10.311 --> 03:33:13.614 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RIGHT NOW AND WHY IS

03:33:11.946 --> 03:33:15.349 region:rollup2
THAT. THE DOCTORS HAVE NO

03:33:13.614 --> 03:33:17.418 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE THEY HAVE NO BARGAINING

03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:19.320 region:rollup2
POWER WITH THESE CONSOLIDATED

03:33:17.418 --> 03:33:21.956 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS WITH THESE MONOPOLISTIC

03:33:19.320 --> 03:33:26.327 region:rollup2
MONOPOLISTIC HOSPITALS AND AND.

03:33:21.956 --> 03:33:27.294 region:rollup2
THE DEAD TAPES SUGGEST THAT

03:33:26.327 --> 03:33:28.496 region:rollup2
THEY DO IS JUST NOT TRUE.

03:33:27.294 --> 03:33:29.063 region:rollup2
AND SO MY AND MY MY ANSWER TO

03:33:28.496 --> 03:33:30.331 region:rollup2
YOU THE SHORT ANSWER IS MEDI

03:33:29.063 --> 03:33:31.899 region:rollup2
CAL.

03:33:30.331 --> 03:33:33.401 region:rollup2
.

03:33:31.899 --> 03:33:34.502 region:rollup2

03:33:34.502 --> 03:33:37.038 region:rollup2
MAJOR PART OF WHAT WE'RE GOING

03:33:35.636 --> 03:33:38.873 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN THE

03:33:37.038 --> 03:33:40.708 region:rollup2
WEEKS AHEAD HOW DO WE ACCOUNT

03:33:38.873 --> 03:33:41.609 region:rollup2
FOR THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE SO

03:33:40.708 --> 03:33:43.844 region:rollup2
MANY MEDI CAL.

03:33:41.609 --> 03:33:45.980 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN OUR STATE AND HOW

03:33:43.844 --> 03:33:47.581 region:rollup2
THE WE INCENTIVIZE DOCTORS TO

03:33:45.980 --> 03:33:49.350 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TAKE MEDI CAL PATIENTS

03:33:47.581 --> 03:33:50.451 region:rollup2
AND MEDICARE PATIENTS BUT FOR

03:33:49.350 --> 03:33:51.819 region:rollup2
DOCTORS TO GOING TO RURAL

03:33:50.451 --> 03:33:52.486 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES UNDERSERVED

03:33:51.819 --> 03:33:53.954 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY DON'T GO

03:33:52.486 --> 03:33:55.489 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. AND THEY DON'T GO

03:33:53.954 --> 03:33:58.993 region:rollup2
THERE BECAUSE THE COMMERCIAL

03:33:55.489 --> 03:34:00.361 region:rollup2
RATES DON'T INCENTIVIZE AND.

03:33:58.993 --> 03:34:00.528 region:rollup2
THING I REPRESENT A RURAL AREA

03:34:00.361 --> 03:34:02.096 region:rollup2
AND.

03:34:00.528 --> 03:34:03.564 region:rollup2
LIKE I GET SOME

03:34:02.096 --> 03:34:06.767 region:rollup2
SOME CONTRADICTORY NAM.

03:34:03.564 --> 03:34:07.468 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS FROM I'M SO MY LOCAL

03:34:06.767 --> 03:34:09.136 region:rollup2
UP LOCAL DOCKS IN HEALTHCARE

03:34:07.468 --> 03:34:10.905 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS. THAT I'M HAPPY TO

03:34:09.136 --> 03:34:12.206 region:rollup2
TALK TO THEM IT IT I GOT A

03:34:10.905 --> 03:34:12.807 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS A COUPLE

03:34:12.206 --> 03:34:14.208 region:rollup2
MORE IF.

03:34:12.807 --> 03:34:15.910 region:rollup2
IF THIS BILL SUPPOSED TO REIN

03:34:14.208 --> 03:34:17.144 region:rollup2
IN COSTS A WHITE AS A SOLELY

03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:18.779 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON GOVERNMENT PRICE FIXING

03:34:17.144 --> 03:34:20.414 region:rollup2
HAS THIS.

03:34:18.779 --> 03:34:22.683 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT UTILIZATION IN THE

03:34:20.414 --> 03:34:24.218 region:rollup2
COST OF LABOR FOR EXAMPLE WHICH

03:34:22.683 --> 03:34:25.486 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO MAJOR COST DRIVERS?

03:34:24.218 --> 03:34:26.620 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S PART OF THE REASON

03:34:25.486 --> 03:34:28.022 region:rollup2
THE AND I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED

03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:29.990 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION BECAUSE THE LAST

03:34:28.022 --> 03:34:31.359 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS. UP WITH WITH THE

03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:33.494 region:rollup2
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WE HAVE

03:34:31.359 --> 03:34:35.296 region:rollup2
SEEN INCREASED ACCESS TO PEOPLE

03:34:33.494 --> 03:34:37.231 region:rollup2
HAVE UPPER HEALTH INSURANCE CARD

03:34:35.296 --> 03:34:38.632 region:rollup2
YOU SEE HEALTHCARE COSTS GO UP

03:34:37.231 --> 03:34:39.900 region:rollup2
BUT UTILIZATION HAS GONE DOWN.

03:34:38.632 --> 03:34:41.502 region:rollup2
SO THAT TELLS US THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:34:39.900 --> 03:34:43.437 region:rollup2
ARE ARE RATIONING THEIR

03:34:41.502 --> 03:34:45.840 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE BECAUSE COSTS ARE

03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:46.907 region:rollup2
GOING UP AND SO THAT IT'S.

03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:48.509 region:rollup2
THE THE.

03:34:46.907 --> 03:34:50.811 region:rollup2
.

03:34:48.509 --> 03:34:52.012 region:rollup2
EUROPEAN QUESTIONING AND.

03:34:50.811 --> 03:34:53.547 region:rollup2
THAT POINT ENTITIES RELIGIOUSLY

03:34:52.012 --> 03:34:54.915 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION IN THE COST OF LABOR

03:34:53.547 --> 03:34:56.450 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT ALL THOSE

03:34:54.915 --> 03:34:58.285 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE ALL THOSE COSTS ARE

03:34:56.450 --> 03:35:00.154 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTED FOR. AND THE README

03:34:58.285 --> 03:35:02.456 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THE COMMENTS MADE

03:35:00.154 --> 03:35:05.159 region:rollup2
BY OPPOSITION WHICH ACTUALLY IS

03:35:02.456 --> 03:35:06.694 region:rollup2
AS IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF.

03:35:05.159 --> 03:35:07.762 region:rollup2
I COUNTING FOR ALL THOSE

03:35:06.694 --> 03:35:09.697 region:rollup2
INCREASED COSTS AND IF YOU LOOK

03:35:07.762 --> 03:35:11.332 region:rollup2
AT WHAT CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

03:35:09.697 --> 03:35:12.967 region:rollup2
THE BASED AT BASE COSTS AND

03:35:11.332 --> 03:35:14.001 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS IT IS INCREASED

03:35:12.967 --> 03:35:15.569 region:rollup2
LABOR COSTS. IT IS.

03:35:14.001 --> 03:35:16.203 region:rollup2
.

03:35:15.569 --> 03:35:18.873 region:rollup2
THE.

03:35:16.203 --> 03:35:19.707 region:rollup2
ENOUGH YOU HAVE MAINTENANCE OR

03:35:18.873 --> 03:35:20.608 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE NEW FACILITIES ARE

03:35:19.707 --> 03:35:22.676 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

03:35:20.608 --> 03:35:24.245 region:rollup2
AND SO THE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF

03:35:22.676 --> 03:35:26.580 region:rollup2
THE GLOBAL CAP WHICH WAS

03:35:24.245 --> 03:35:29.216 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO IS TO ENSURE YES IF

03:35:26.580 --> 03:35:30.251 region:rollup2
WE DO SET RATES FOR BUT SERVICES

03:35:29.216 --> 03:35:31.685 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS

03:35:30.251 --> 03:35:32.887 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN IN MARYLAND

03:35:31.685 --> 03:35:34.221 region:rollup2
IS THAT PEOPLE JUST STARTED.

03:35:32.887 --> 03:35:36.123 region:rollup2
INCREASING NUMBER THE SERVICES

03:35:34.221 --> 03:35:38.192 region:rollup2
THEY DID TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND

03:35:36.123 --> 03:35:40.194 region:rollup2
IT WAS NASA CONNECTED TO CARE.

03:35:38.192 --> 03:35:41.729 region:rollup2
AND AND WHAT WAS NEEDED SO THAT

03:35:40.194 --> 03:35:43.597 region:rollup2
MARYLAND A FEW YEARS AGO

03:35:41.729 --> 03:35:45.399 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT SORT OF PUTTING

03:35:43.597 --> 03:35:46.767 region:rollup2
GLOBAL CAPSULAR DEFERRED OR A S.

03:35:45.399 --> 03:35:48.736 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU REPRESENTATIVE IN TERMS

03:35:46.767 --> 03:35:50.504 region:rollup2
OF LABOR COSTS. BUT I MENTION

03:35:48.736 --> 03:35:52.006 region:rollup2
THE GLOBAL CLOCK CAP BECAUSE

03:35:50.504 --> 03:35:52.506 region:rollup2
THAT IS A WAY TO ENSURE THAT

03:35:52.006 --> 03:35:54.074 region:rollup2
COST ON TO SPIRAL OUT OF

03:35:52.506 --> 03:35:56.210 region:rollup2
CONTROL.

03:35:54.074 --> 03:35:57.511 region:rollup2
ON LABOR SIDE WHAT HAVE YOU AND

03:35:56.210 --> 03:35:59.013 region:rollup2
THEN THE HOSPITAL OR THE

03:35:57.511 --> 03:36:01.849 region:rollup2
DOCTOR'S AT THE DEAL WITH THAT

03:35:59.013 --> 03:36:02.917 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING LESS ON

03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:05.286 region:rollup2
THE POLL ON THE. RIGHT SIDE.

03:36:02.917 --> 03:36:07.154 region:rollup2
THANK YOU OF VICE CHAIR MAYES.

AGREEMENTS WITH HOSPITALS LABOR

03:36:08.722 --> 03:36:13.994 region:rollup2
COST INCREASES HAVE BEEN STEADY

03:36:11.859 --> 03:36:15.429 region:rollup2
AT AROUND TWO PERCENT WE ACCOUNT

03:36:13.994 --> 03:36:17.598 region:rollup2
FOR MAYBE ONE TO TWO PERCENT OF

03:36:15.429 --> 03:36:18.833 region:rollup2
OVERALL COST INCREASES IN THE

03:36:17.598 --> 03:36:21.502 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SECTOR. WHICH.

03:36:18.833 --> 03:36:23.671 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN OUT PIECING

03:36:21.502 --> 03:36:26.373 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUG CROSS COSTS AS

03:36:23.671 --> 03:36:29.210 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER ONE FASTEST GROWING.

03:36:26.373 --> 03:36:31.612 region:rollup2
PRICE INCREASE IN HEALTH CARE

03:36:29.210 --> 03:36:32.913 region:rollup2
SO. LET ME REPHRASE THAT

03:36:31.612 --> 03:36:34.281 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL COSTS HAVE BEEN GOING

03:36:32.913 --> 03:36:35.115 region:rollup2
UP FASTER THAN PRESCRIPTION DRUG

03:36:34.281 --> 03:36:35.850 region:rollup2
COSTS

03:36:35.115 --> 03:36:37.885 region:rollup2
AND.

03:36:35.850 --> 03:36:39.720 region:rollup2
WE CAN PROVIDE A CITATION ON

03:36:37.885 --> 03:36:41.055 region:rollup2
THAT BUT CLEARLY IF WERE ONE

03:36:39.720 --> 03:36:43.190 region:rollup2
PERCENT TWO PERCENT OF THE

03:36:41.055 --> 03:36:45.059 region:rollup2
OVERALL PRICE INCREASES OVER

03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:46.961 region:rollup2
TIME AND HOLDING STEADY.

03:36:45.059 --> 03:36:49.430 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT REALLY THE DRIVER OF

03:36:46.961 --> 03:36:50.998 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH. PRICE.

03:36:49.430 --> 03:36:51.999 region:rollup2
WELL IT AND IT JUST ONE MORE

03:36:50.998 --> 03:36:53.567 region:rollup2
QUESTION BECAUSE IT ACTION

WHAT'S GOING TO GET TO THAT TO

03:36:53.567 --> 03:36:56.670 region:rollup2
THAT POINT I MEAN IN READING

03:36:55.336 --> 03:36:57.671 region:rollup2
THIS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

03:36:56.670 --> 03:36:58.239 region:rollup2
DAYS IT SEEMED LIKE THE

03:36:57.671 --> 03:36:59.340 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS IN THE POLITICS OF

03:36:58.239 --> 03:37:00.841 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:02.877 region:rollup2
A SEEM LITTLE OFF

03:37:00.841 --> 03:37:04.812 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT.

03:37:02.877 --> 03:37:06.480 region:rollup2
.

03:37:04.812 --> 03:37:08.015 region:rollup2
YEAH I DON'T I GUESS I'M I'M.

03:37:06.480 --> 03:37:09.016 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION I HAVE IS HOW WILL.

03:37:08.015 --> 03:37:10.517 region:rollup2
HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN

03:37:09.016 --> 03:37:11.852 region:rollup2
HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN

03:37:10.517 --> 03:37:13.287 region:rollup2
UNREGULATED PAY RAISES AND

03:37:11.852 --> 03:37:14.455 region:rollup2
BENEFIT INCREASES FOR CERTAIN

03:37:13.287 --> 03:37:16.490 region:rollup2
GROUPS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

03:37:14.455 --> 03:37:18.092 region:rollup2
LIKE NURSES AND. I AM ALLIED

03:37:16.490 --> 03:37:18.893 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHAT THE

03:37:18.092 --> 03:37:19.894 region:rollup2
SAME TIME COMPLETELY

03:37:18.893 --> 03:37:21.095 region:rollup2
CONSTRAINING THE RATES AND

03:37:19.894 --> 03:37:23.163 region:rollup2
CHARGES OF THE PEOPLE THE

03:37:21.095 --> 03:37:24.999 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL'S OPPOSITION GROUPS.

03:37:23.163 --> 03:37:27.268 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE TO PAY THOSE WORKERS IT

03:37:24.999 --> 03:37:29.370 region:rollup2
IN ECONOMIC SENSE IN IT AND FROM

03:37:27.268 --> 03:37:30.237 region:rollup2
AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE IT JUST

03:37:29.370 --> 03:37:32.840 region:rollup2
DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HOW

03:37:30.237 --> 03:37:35.676 region:rollup2
DO WE? HOW DO WE? JUSTIFY THOSE

03:37:32.840 --> 03:37:37.311 region:rollup2
TO. THOSE PAY RATE INCREASES ARE

03:37:35.676 --> 03:37:38.178 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTED FOR AND HOW THE RATES

03:37:37.311 --> 03:37:40.948 region:rollup2
ARE JUST.

03:37:38.178 --> 03:37:42.750 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE IS OF A BARGAINING

03:37:40.948 --> 03:37:43.851 region:rollup2
UNIT HOSPITAL AND THEY AGREED TO

03:37:42.750 --> 03:37:45.519 region:rollup2
GIVE THE NURSES A TWO PERCENT

03:37:43.851 --> 03:37:47.054 region:rollup2
PAY RAISE WELL IN THE AND NUMBER

03:37:45.519 --> 03:37:49.790 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN ANNUAL. REVIEW SO

03:37:47.054 --> 03:37:51.258 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER. AS THAT OCCURS RATES

03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:52.559 region:rollup2
CAN BE ADJUSTED BY THAT SAME

03:37:51.258 --> 03:37:53.494 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE ACCOUNT FOR THAT.

03:37:52.559 --> 03:37:56.664 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE COMMISSION IS

03:37:53.494 --> 03:38:00.401 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO FACTOR LABOR COSTS

03:37:56.664 --> 03:38:02.202 region:rollup2
INTO THE BASE RATE SO NOT. NOT

03:38:00.401 --> 03:38:04.905 region:rollup2
THE YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME BACK

03:38:02.202 --> 03:38:06.907 region:rollup2
HIM GONNA APPEAL IT THE BASE

03:38:04.905 --> 03:38:09.076 region:rollup2
RATE NEEDS TO FACTOR IN YOUR THE

03:38:06.907 --> 03:38:11.478 region:rollup2
COST OF LABOR THE COST OF DOING

03:38:09.076 --> 03:38:13.681 region:rollup2
BUSINESS. PLUS A REASONABLE RATE

03:38:11.478 --> 03:38:15.583 region:rollup2
OF RETURN. AND IN ADDITION ON

03:38:13.681 --> 03:38:17.751 region:rollup2
TOP OF THAT ACT AREAS WHERE

03:38:15.583 --> 03:38:19.219 region:rollup2
THERE ACCESS PROBLEMS ALL OF

03:38:17.751 --> 03:38:20.688 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN THE BASE

03:38:19.219 --> 03:38:22.790 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ABOVE THAT YOU CAN

03:38:20.688 --> 03:38:23.824 region:rollup2
APPEAL FOR BUT ALL OF THAT

03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:25.025 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

03:38:23.824 --> 03:38:27.094 region:rollup2
BAIT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A

03:38:25.025 --> 03:38:28.729 region:rollup2
SORT OF ONE. A HOMOGENEOUS

03:38:27.094 --> 03:38:30.597 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD RATE IT'S

03:38:28.729 --> 03:38:33.300 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BASED ON MEDICARE WHICH

03:38:30.597 --> 03:38:34.568 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE VARIATION WITHIN IT BY

03:38:33.300 --> 03:38:36.170 region:rollup2
REGION AND BY.

03:38:34.568 --> 03:38:36.737 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS SERVICE.

03:38:36.170 --> 03:38:39.406 region:rollup2
OKAY KIND OF THE OPPOSITION

03:38:36.737 --> 03:38:40.474 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:38:39.406 --> 03:38:41.642 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN RESTORE TALK

03:38:40.474 --> 03:38:43.344 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL

03:38:41.642 --> 03:38:44.712 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION I JUST BRIEFLY WANT

03:38:43.344 --> 03:38:45.446 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE

03:38:44.712 --> 03:38:47.314 region:rollup2
COMMENTS I THINK THE FIRST ONE

03:38:45.446 --> 03:38:48.615 region:rollup2
WOULD BE. THAT WE HAVE GREAT

03:38:47.314 --> 03:38:49.917 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT AN ELEVEN MEMBER

03:38:48.615 --> 03:38:51.719 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS GOING TO

03:38:49.917 --> 03:38:53.220 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY SEPARATES FOR BEFORE

03:38:51.719 --> 03:38:55.055 region:rollup2
UNDER HOSPITALS OVER A HUNDRED

03:38:53.220 --> 03:38:56.590 region:rollup2
THOUSAND PHYSICIANS. IN A MANNER

03:38:55.055 --> 03:38:57.891 region:rollup2
THAT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE I KNOW

03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:59.159 region:rollup2
THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT THE

03:38:57.891 --> 03:39:00.861 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TAKE THESE FACTORS INTO

03:38:59.159 --> 03:39:01.462 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT. BUT IF THEY GET IT

03:39:00.861 --> 03:39:03.497 region:rollup2
WRONG.

03:39:01.462 --> 03:39:04.531 region:rollup2
THE RAT THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR

03:39:03.497 --> 03:39:07.001 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS.

03:39:04.531 --> 03:39:08.669 region:rollup2
QUITE SEVERE AND SECONDLY THE

03:39:07.001 --> 03:39:09.903 region:rollup2
STATISTICS THAT ARE CITED BOTH

03:39:08.669 --> 03:39:11.305 region:rollup2
IN THE ATTACK LANGUAGE AND THAT

03:39:09.903 --> 03:39:13.774 region:rollup2
THE PROPONENTS CONTINUE SITE ARE

03:39:11.305 --> 03:39:15.175 region:rollup2
BASED ON NATIONAL A STATISTICS

03:39:13.774 --> 03:39:16.777 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO POINT

03:39:15.175 --> 03:39:18.145 region:rollup2
OUT IN CALIFORNIA. AGAIN THE

03:39:16.777 --> 03:39:19.480 region:rollup2
POSITION GROWTH WITH OVER THE

03:39:18.145 --> 03:39:21.315 region:rollup2
LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS BASED

03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:22.549 region:rollup2
ON MEDICARE DATA ACROSS ALL

03:39:21.315 --> 03:39:24.218 region:rollup2
PAYERS IS THREE POINT SIX

03:39:22.549 --> 03:39:26.153 region:rollup2
PERCENT THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IS

03:39:24.218 --> 03:39:27.755 region:rollup2
FOUR POINT FIVE AT WE ARE THE

03:39:26.153 --> 03:39:29.556 region:rollup2
LOWEST AS FAR AS WAS USED IN

03:39:27.755 --> 03:39:31.625 region:rollup2
SERVICE AS HAS BEEN THE LOWEST

03:39:29.556 --> 03:39:33.594 region:rollup2
GROWTH. OF ANY STATE I'M SO THE

03:39:31.625 --> 03:39:35.396 region:rollup2
FACT THAT NOW AS A RESULT OF

03:39:33.594 --> 03:39:36.063 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO PUT FAITH IN

03:39:35.396 --> 03:39:37.665 region:rollup2
ELEVEN MEMBER COMMISSION THAT'S

03:39:36.063 --> 03:39:38.432 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

03:39:37.665 --> 03:39:41.735 region:rollup2
ALL THESE FACTORS.

03:39:38.432 --> 03:39:43.103 region:rollup2
QUICKLY IS REALLY UNREALISTIC

03:39:41.735 --> 03:39:44.638 region:rollup2
AND AS FAR AS THE WORLD ACCESS.

03:39:43.103 --> 03:39:46.273 region:rollup2
MOST OF YOUR RURAL MEMBERS TO

03:39:44.638 --> 03:39:48.876 region:rollup2
RURAL HOSPITALS ARE SEEN

03:39:46.273 --> 03:39:49.610 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ON MEDI CAL AND

03:39:48.876 --> 03:39:52.012 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:54.448 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ALTHOUGH IT SPEAKS TO

03:39:52.012 --> 03:39:56.050 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL MEDICARE DOES NOTHING

03:39:54.448 --> 03:39:57.518 region:rollup2
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY.

03:39:56.050 --> 03:39:59.119 region:rollup2
TO RAISE THOSE RATES WERE

03:39:57.518 --> 03:40:00.554 region:rollup2
INCREASED ACCESS IF IF THEY WANT

03:39:59.119 --> 03:40:01.889 region:rollup2
TO PUT IN AN INCREASE IN MEDICAL

03:40:00.554 --> 03:40:02.723 region:rollup2
RATES UP TO MEDICARE I THINK

03:40:01.889 --> 03:40:04.525 region:rollup2
THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE COULD

03:40:02.723 --> 03:40:06.627 region:rollup2
HAVE. BREWING TALK ABOUT THIRD

03:40:04.525 --> 03:40:07.828 region:rollup2
OF THE MARKET AND AGAIN MEDI CAL

03:40:06.627 --> 03:40:10.864 region:rollup2
ON POSITION SERVICES BATES ABOUT

03:40:07.828 --> 03:40:12.466 region:rollup2
SIXTY PERCENT. OF OF MEDICARE

03:40:10.864 --> 03:40:15.269 region:rollup2
AND IT'S OFTEN BELOW COST.

03:40:12.466 --> 03:40:16.804 region:rollup2
IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE.

03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:18.439 region:rollup2
HONESTLY ON WORKABILITY OF

03:40:16.804 --> 03:40:20.374 region:rollup2
APPEALS SYSTEM.

03:40:18.439 --> 03:40:22.409 region:rollup2
HAVING SPENT MANY YEARS IN

03:40:20.374 --> 03:40:24.378 region:rollup2
MARILYN THIS IS NOT AT ALL HOW

03:40:22.409 --> 03:40:25.212 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM IN MARYLAND WORKS IT

03:40:24.378 --> 03:40:26.847 region:rollup2
WAS A SYSTEM THAT WORKED

03:40:25.212 --> 03:40:27.681 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY FOR FORTY YEARS AND

03:40:26.847 --> 03:40:29.616 region:rollup2
THEN.

03:40:27.681 --> 03:40:31.852 region:rollup2
THE STATE.

03:40:29.616 --> 03:40:33.353 region:rollup2
TOOK A WHOLE NEW APPROACH.

03:40:31.852 --> 03:40:34.755 region:rollup2
BUT THERE THE RATES ARE SET

03:40:33.353 --> 03:40:36.557 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COSTS

03:40:34.755 --> 03:40:38.058 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED BY A HOSPITAL. HAS A

03:40:36.557 --> 03:40:38.826 region:rollup2
VERY OFTEN HIGHER IN AN URBAN

03:40:38.058 --> 03:40:40.327 region:rollup2
AREA AND THEY ARE IN A RURAL

03:40:38.826 --> 03:40:41.795 region:rollup2
AREA. THEIR HIGHER FOR A

03:40:40.327 --> 03:40:43.931 region:rollup2
TEACHING HOSPITAL THAN A NON

03:40:41.795 --> 03:40:44.798 region:rollup2
TEACHING HOSPITAL THEY HAVE TO

03:40:43.931 --> 03:40:46.100 region:rollup2
REFLECT THE CHALLENGE

03:40:44.798 --> 03:40:47.735 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT HOSPITALS

03:40:46.100 --> 03:40:48.769 region:rollup2
TREATING LARGE NUMBERS OF

03:40:47.735 --> 03:40:51.472 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID WITH

03:40:48.769 --> 03:40:53.874 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT. UNDER FUNDING NEED

03:40:51.472 --> 03:40:55.275 region:rollup2
TO STAY AFLOAT IT IS NOT AN

03:40:53.874 --> 03:40:56.877 region:rollup2
APPEALS PROCESS IS A VERY

03:40:55.275 --> 03:40:58.212 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGEABLE GROUP OF PEOPLE

03:40:56.877 --> 03:40:59.546 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S

03:40:58.212 --> 03:41:02.015 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE SETTING

03:40:59.546 --> 03:41:04.151 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL RATES THERE IS NO

03:41:02.015 --> 03:41:05.285 region:rollup2
TIME. TO MEDICARE. AND BY THE

03:41:04.151 --> 03:41:06.787 region:rollup2
WAY.

03:41:05.285 --> 03:41:09.056 region:rollup2
FOR A COUNTRY THAT IS JUST

03:41:06.787 --> 03:41:11.425 region:rollup2
INCREASED OUR FEDERAL DEFICIT BY

03:41:09.056 --> 03:41:13.427 region:rollup2
ONE AND A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS.

03:41:11.425 --> 03:41:15.162 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS TO FEDERAL MEDICARE

03:41:13.427 --> 03:41:16.530 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS HAS MORE TO DO WITH

03:41:15.162 --> 03:41:18.365 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FEDERAL

03:41:16.530 --> 03:41:20.033 region:rollup2
DEFICIT AND DEBT THAN IT DOES

03:41:18.365 --> 03:41:21.268 region:rollup2
WITH ANY HEALTHCARE POLICY? WHY

03:41:20.033 --> 03:41:23.270 region:rollup2
WOULD WE IN CALIFORNIA ONE A

03:41:21.268 --> 03:41:24.738 region:rollup2
TETHER OURSELVES TO A RATE

03:41:23.270 --> 03:41:27.207 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING DRIVEN? BY DEFICITS

03:41:24.738 --> 03:41:28.842 region:rollup2
AND DEBT.

03:41:27.207 --> 03:41:30.210 region:rollup2
MISS MISTER CHAIR BY GOOD REVIEW

03:41:28.842 --> 03:41:31.879 region:rollup2
IF I COULD RESPOND TO THAT YOU

03:41:30.210 --> 03:41:33.313 region:rollup2
KNOW ALL ALL. ALL OF THOSE

03:41:31.879 --> 03:41:34.348 region:rollup2
FACTORS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

03:41:33.313 --> 03:41:35.716 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IN THE BASE

03:41:34.348 --> 03:41:37.384 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS AND WOULDN'T EVEN

03:41:35.716 --> 03:41:38.452 region:rollup2
REQUIRED APPEAL OF COURSE THE

03:41:37.384 --> 03:41:40.154 region:rollup2
APPEAL PROCESS AND STILL

03:41:38.452 --> 03:41:41.421 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE. SO WHETHER IT'S A

03:41:40.154 --> 03:41:43.190 region:rollup2
TEACHING HOSPITAL A RESEARCH

03:41:41.421 --> 03:41:44.892 region:rollup2
FACILITY IN A RULE COMMUNITY IN

03:41:43.190 --> 03:41:46.460 region:rollup2
URBAN COMMUNITY HIGHER COST

03:41:44.892 --> 03:41:48.529 region:rollup2
LIVING LOWER COST LIVING THAT'S

03:41:46.460 --> 03:41:49.730 region:rollup2
ALL CAUGHT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

03:41:48.529 --> 03:41:51.165 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED BASE RATE.

03:41:49.730 --> 03:41:53.066 region:rollup2
AND WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE

03:41:51.165 --> 03:41:54.001 region:rollup2
FACT THAT. THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT

03:41:53.066 --> 03:41:55.702 region:rollup2
THAT AND RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY

03:41:54.001 --> 03:41:57.871 region:rollup2
ONLY TAKE MEDI CAL ON MEDICARE

03:41:55.702 --> 03:41:58.605 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IS A PROBLEM.

03:41:57.871 --> 03:41:59.373 region:rollup2
THE FACT THEY DON'T HAVE

03:41:58.605 --> 03:42:00.774 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST THOSE COMMUNITIES AS

03:41:59.373 --> 03:42:02.476 region:rollup2
A PROBLEM.

03:42:00.774 --> 03:42:02.943 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT A WE ACTUALLY

03:42:02.476 --> 03:42:03.477 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCOUNT FOR THOSE

03:42:02.943 --> 03:42:05.813 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES AND GIVE

03:42:03.477 --> 03:42:06.814 region:rollup2
CREDIT.

03:42:05.813 --> 03:42:08.615 region:rollup2
TO THOSE DOCTORS IN THOSE

03:42:06.814 --> 03:42:10.117 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS THAT ARE. SOLELY

03:42:08.615 --> 03:42:12.052 region:rollup2
TAKING CARE OF LOW INCOME

03:42:10.117 --> 03:42:12.886 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS THE WE CANNOT YOU

03:42:12.052 --> 03:42:14.655 region:rollup2
JUST COMMERCIAL RATES

03:42:12.886 --> 03:42:15.455 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

03:42:14.655 --> 03:42:16.523 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEVERAGE TO

03:42:15.455 --> 03:42:19.459 region:rollup2
DO THAT.

03:42:16.523 --> 03:42:21.161 region:rollup2
IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT.

03:42:19.459 --> 03:42:23.030 region:rollup2
JERRY JUST FIVE IF I CAN CLOSE

03:42:21.161 --> 03:42:24.798 region:rollup2
BY JUST SAYING.

03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:26.600 region:rollup2
AGAIN MISTER KALRA UNDERSTAND OF

03:42:24.798 --> 03:42:27.634 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM I'M I THINK IT'S

03:42:26.600 --> 03:42:29.002 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE ALL NEED TO TO

03:42:27.634 --> 03:42:30.470 region:rollup2
WORK OUT WORK ON.

03:42:29.002 --> 03:42:32.206 region:rollup2

TOGETHER A TO TRY TO LOWER THE

03:42:42.883 --> 03:42:45.586 region:rollup2
COST IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM I

03:42:44.985 --> 03:42:45.819 region:rollup2
JUST THINK THIS THE THE WRONG

03:42:45.586 --> 03:42:48.622 region:rollup2
APPROACH

03:42:45.819 --> 03:42:51.391 region:rollup2

ASSERTIONS THAT WAS MADE THAT

03:43:02.336 --> 03:43:07.908 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. WOULD LEAD OPPOSITION

03:43:05.138 --> 03:43:10.177 region:rollup2

RECENTLY ON THIS ISSUE AND THAT

03:43:13.180 --> 03:43:16.049 region:rollup2
WAS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT

03:43:14.514 --> 03:43:17.484 region:rollup2
WAS PRESENTED THAT.

03:43:16.049 --> 03:43:19.386 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WOULD.

03:43:17.484 --> 03:43:20.187 region:rollup2
BASICALLY BE IN A POSITION

03:43:19.386 --> 03:43:22.489 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY COULDN'T.

03:43:20.187 --> 03:43:23.423 region:rollup2
EARN ENOUGH IN THEIR PRACTICE

03:43:22.489 --> 03:43:24.958 region:rollup2
IN TO PAY OFF LOANS AND THAT IT

03:43:23.423 --> 03:43:26.093 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE SUCH A TREAT AN

03:43:24.958 --> 03:43:27.327 region:rollup2
ACCESS PROBLEM WHICH YOU KNOW

03:43:26.093 --> 03:43:28.729 region:rollup2
UPS YOU WANT CONTROL COSTS BUT

PARTS OF OUR STATE RIGHT NOW.

03:43:36.203 --> 03:43:39.539 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

03:43:37.905 --> 03:43:40.907 region:rollup2
THE THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL AND

03:43:39.539 --> 03:43:42.009 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE COMPENSATED AND

03:43:40.907 --> 03:43:43.810 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY.

03:43:42.009 --> 03:43:45.279 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PRACTICE.

03:43:43.810 --> 03:43:47.147 region:rollup2
OR FOR HOSPITALS.

03:43:45.279 --> 03:43:48.949 region:rollup2

03:44:31.892 --> 03:44:35.395 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

03:44:33.527 --> 03:44:36.563 region:rollup2
FOR DOCTORS. COMING OUT OF

03:44:35.395 --> 03:44:37.464 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL WITH A LOT OF

03:44:36.563 --> 03:44:39.199 region:rollup2
DEBT.

03:44:37.464 --> 03:44:40.567 region:rollup2
DE.

03:44:39.199 --> 03:44:41.702 region:rollup2
AFFRONT FIRST OF ALL DOCTORS ARE

03:44:40.567 --> 03:44:43.403 region:rollup2
NOT BE INCORPORATING THIS INTO

03:44:41.702 --> 03:44:44.338 region:rollup2
THEIR DATA AND THAT AND THAT

03:44:43.403 --> 03:44:46.673 region:rollup2
WILL BE TAKE AT LEAST THREE

03:44:44.338 --> 03:44:49.276 region:rollup2
YEARS TO GET DATA. OF REAL

03:44:46.673 --> 03:44:51.211 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SECONDLY WE BELIEVE

03:44:49.276 --> 03:44:53.680 region:rollup2
THAT WITH THIS IN PLACE YOU'LL

03:44:51.211 --> 03:44:55.515 region:rollup2
HAVE A SAVINGS AND PUBLIC PLANS.

03:44:53.680 --> 03:44:57.117 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE SAVINGS NOT ONLY TO

03:44:55.515 --> 03:44:58.885 region:rollup2
BE SEEK TO HELP IMPROVE MEDI CAL

03:44:57.117 --> 03:45:01.021 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES BUT WE ALSO

03:44:58.885 --> 03:45:03.457 region:rollup2
WANT TO AB FUND AT A MUCH HIGHER

03:45:01.021 --> 03:45:05.025 region:rollup2
LEVEL PROGRAMS THAT RIGHT NOW.

03:45:03.457 --> 03:45:06.259 region:rollup2
ARE AVAILABLE TO DOCTORS THERE

03:45:05.025 --> 03:45:07.694 region:rollup2
JUST UNDER FUNDED THEY'RE

03:45:06.259 --> 03:45:09.429 region:rollup2
WEIGHTLESS FOR THEM DOCTORS

03:45:07.694 --> 03:45:10.931 region:rollup2
GOING INTO RESIDENTS HE'S PUT UP

03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:12.332 region:rollup2
LONG REPAYMENT PROGRAMS.

03:45:10.931 --> 03:45:14.134 region:rollup2
WE WANNA WORK OF REDUCE LOAN

03:45:12.332 --> 03:45:16.169 region:rollup2
DEBT FRY DOCTORS COMING OUT OF

03:45:14.134 --> 03:45:17.537 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SCHOOL AND WE THINK THAT

03:45:16.169 --> 03:45:19.039 region:rollup2
WE CAN DO THAT WITH COST SAVINGS

03:45:17.537 --> 03:45:20.040 region:rollup2
ON THIS BILL.

03:45:19.039 --> 03:45:21.475 region:rollup2
WITH COSTS AND THE COSTUMES

03:45:20.040 --> 03:45:23.977 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN THE

03:45:21.475 --> 03:45:25.412 region:rollup2
EXPECTED RISE IN HEALTHCARE

03:45:23.977 --> 03:45:27.781 region:rollup2
COSTS IN THE DO WHAT ONE OR TWO

03:45:25.412 --> 03:45:29.049 region:rollup2
DECADES AHEAD WITHOUT ALONE WE

03:45:27.781 --> 03:45:31.084 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT WE CAN HAVE IN

03:45:29.049 --> 03:45:32.252 region:rollup2
PUBLIC PLANS ALONE. BILLIONS OF

03:45:31.084 --> 03:45:33.520 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS

03:45:32.252 --> 03:45:34.721 region:rollup2
YOU MENTION MEDICARE RATES IS

03:45:33.520 --> 03:45:36.123 region:rollup2
GOING ON A MISSION MEDICARE RESA

03:45:34.721 --> 03:45:37.824 region:rollup2
OUT YOU KNOW A LOT OF US HAVE

03:45:36.123 --> 03:45:39.259 region:rollup2
WORKED ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME

03:45:37.824 --> 03:45:41.061 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT HOW LOW MEDICARE

03:45:39.259 --> 03:45:42.229 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE. UP

03:45:41.061 --> 03:45:43.196 region:rollup2
WOULD SHOOT WHICH YOU STATE WHAT

03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:44.031 region:rollup2
YOU WERE SAYING A MINUTE AGO

03:45:43.196 --> 03:45:45.432 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

03:45:44.031 --> 03:45:46.633 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CREATING MORE

03:45:45.432 --> 03:45:48.034 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE AS I

03:45:46.633 --> 03:45:50.203 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IT SOME OF THE

03:45:48.034 --> 03:45:52.406 region:rollup2
DOCTORS WHO ACCEPT PRIVATE PAY

03:45:50.203 --> 03:45:54.341 region:rollup2
AND MEDI CAL ESSENTIALLY USE A

03:45:52.406 --> 03:45:56.243 region:rollup2
PRIVATE PAY PATIENTS TO HELP IN

03:45:54.341 --> 03:45:57.210 region:rollup2
A WAY. UP MAKE UP FOR THE FACT

03:45:56.243 --> 03:45:59.479 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEDICARE RATES REALLY

03:45:57.210 --> 03:46:00.047 region:rollup2
LOW AND AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT

03:45:59.479 --> 03:46:02.282 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

03:46:00.047 --> 03:46:03.750 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:46:02.282 --> 03:46:04.985 region:rollup2
THAT THOUGHT THANK YOU MET THE I

03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:06.453 region:rollup2
THINK IN A STATEMENT THAT'S THE

03:46:04.985 --> 03:46:07.587 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THAT SOMETHING REALITY.

03:46:06.453 --> 03:46:09.156 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT.

03:46:07.587 --> 03:46:11.591 region:rollup2
THIS COMMISSION CAN SET THAT AS

03:46:09.156 --> 03:46:12.893 region:rollup2
A REALITY THAT THOSE DOCTORS ARE

03:46:11.591 --> 03:46:14.594 region:rollup2
TAKING MORE MEDI CAL PATIENTS

03:46:12.893 --> 03:46:15.629 region:rollup2
MEDICARE BUT PATIENTS WOULD GET

03:46:14.594 --> 03:46:17.197 region:rollup2
A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT THE

03:46:15.629 --> 03:46:19.066 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATE. THE REALITY IS

03:46:17.197 --> 03:46:20.734 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT THE COST DRIVER OF

03:46:19.066 --> 03:46:22.202 region:rollup2
THE COST WEBER IS NOT BECAUSE

03:46:20.734 --> 03:46:23.904 region:rollup2
DOCTORS ARE TAKING MORE MEDI CAL

03:46:22.202 --> 03:46:25.372 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PATIENTS DESPISES IS

03:46:23.904 --> 03:46:26.773 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.

03:46:25.372 --> 03:46:27.607 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF THE HOSPITALS OF

03:46:26.773 --> 03:46:29.309 region:rollup2
YOU SEEN DRAMATIC INCREASE IN

03:46:27.607 --> 03:46:31.077 region:rollup2
RATES IS NOT BECAUSE THOSE

03:46:29.309 --> 03:46:32.379 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS HAVE THE DISPROPORTION

03:46:31.077 --> 03:46:33.914 region:rollup2
NUMBER MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE

03:46:32.379 --> 03:46:35.882 region:rollup2
PATIENTS COMPARED TO OTHER

03:46:33.914 --> 03:46:37.250 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT DON'T SEE. THAT

03:46:35.882 --> 03:46:38.985 region:rollup2
KIND OF INCH INCREASING RATES

03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:41.388 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS COMMISSION WILL HAVE

03:46:38.985 --> 03:46:44.024 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY.

03:46:41.388 --> 03:46:46.026 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE A LEAD TO THAT LEAD TO

03:46:44.024 --> 03:46:47.360 region:rollup2
THE RECOGNITION OF THOSE DOCTORS

03:46:46.026 --> 03:46:49.563 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY

03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:50.864 region:rollup2
TAKING PATIENTS THAT ARE ANNIE

03:46:49.563 --> 03:46:52.466 region:rollup2
TAKING MEDICARE AND TAKING MEDI

03:46:50.864 --> 03:46:53.934 region:rollup2
CAL PATIENTS.

03:46:52.466 --> 03:46:55.902 region:rollup2
AND TO COMPENSATE THEM

03:46:53.934 --> 03:46:56.636 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE THEM FOR DOING THAT

03:46:55.902 --> 03:46:57.571 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN RURAL

03:46:56.636 --> 03:46:58.738 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

MEDI CAL MEDICARE PATIENTS AND

03:47:01.541 --> 03:47:04.311 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIALISTS AND

03:47:02.943 --> 03:47:05.846 region:rollup2
ANOTHER THAT WILL GO A FAMILY

03:47:04.311 --> 03:47:06.947 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS OTHERS ARE GOING

03:47:05.846 --> 03:47:08.281 region:rollup2

INCENTIVE FOR DOCTORS TO GO INTO

03:47:13.520 --> 03:47:16.189 region:rollup2
THOSE RULE COMMUNITIES. AND

03:47:15.555 --> 03:47:17.090 region:rollup2

.

03:47:25.465 --> 03:47:27.901 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT DRUG COSTS NOT

03:47:27.033 --> 03:47:29.369 region:rollup2

03:47:27.901 --> 03:47:31.171 region:rollup2
REALLY ONE OF THE THINGS ONE OF

03:47:29.369 --> 03:47:33.540 region:rollup2
THE OTHER COSTS THAT CONSUMERS

03:47:31.171 --> 03:47:35.375 region:rollup2
OFTEN FEEL THE PINCH. ON WHY

03:47:33.540 --> 03:47:36.009 region:rollup2

ITSELF.

03:47:41.281 --> 03:47:45.418 region:rollup2
MUCH HAS BEEN SAID THAT THIS

03:47:43.283 --> 03:47:46.119 region:rollup2
COMMISSION CAN NOT PROPERLY SET

03:47:45.418 --> 03:47:48.021 region:rollup2
RATES.

03:47:46.119 --> 03:47:49.723 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE PACE

03:47:48.021 --> 03:47:50.857 region:rollup2
WITH THIS INDUSTRY I WOULD LIKE

I'M SURE YOU CAN ADDRESS THE

03:47:52.592 --> 03:47:56.696 region:rollup2

THEM IN SO.

03:47:59.466 --> 03:48:02.736 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CHALLENGES I THINK IT

03:48:01.101 --> 03:48:04.704 region:rollup2
AND MANY IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

03:48:02.736 --> 03:48:06.573 region:rollup2
FACED A BECAUSE I KNOW. MANY OF

03:48:04.704 --> 03:48:08.675 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE GRAPPLED

03:48:06.573 --> 03:48:10.343 region:rollup2
WITH THE ISSUE OF. PERCEPTION

DRUGS.

03:48:10.343 --> 03:48:13.914 region:rollup2
AND PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS.

03:48:12.345 --> 03:48:16.683 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES IN

03:48:13.914 --> 03:48:18.318 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF

03:48:16.683 --> 03:48:19.553 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WE CAN DO BUT I DO

03:48:18.318 --> 03:48:20.620 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THROUGH THIS BILL WE CAN

03:48:19.553 --> 03:48:22.255 region:rollup2
DO MORE THAN WE'VE EVER DONE

03:48:20.620 --> 03:48:23.990 region:rollup2
BEFORE. AND SOME OF THE POLICY

03:48:22.255 --> 03:48:25.625 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT.

03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:27.394 region:rollup2
MOVED FROM THE CHAIR AND HIS

03:48:25.625 --> 03:48:28.662 region:rollup2
STAFF THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING A

03:48:27.394 --> 03:48:30.096 region:rollup2
DOES EVEN FURTHER THAN THE

03:48:28.662 --> 03:48:31.498 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE BEING CLUED IN TERMS OF

03:48:30.096 --> 03:48:32.532 region:rollup2
JUST DOING A REPORT. ON

03:48:31.498 --> 03:48:34.734 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT I

03:48:32.532 --> 03:48:36.570 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY FINDING WAYS IN WHICH

03:48:34.734 --> 03:48:38.104 region:rollup2
WE CAN DETERMINE METHODS OF THE

03:48:36.570 --> 03:48:39.139 region:rollup2
STATE GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY CAN

03:48:38.104 --> 03:48:40.440 region:rollup2
ACT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.

03:48:39.139 --> 03:48:41.875 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE KEY THINGS ABOUT

03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:44.177 region:rollup2
THIS COMMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY

03:48:41.875 --> 03:48:45.612 region:rollup2
PROVIDES RATHER THAN HAVING US

AS MUCH AS I BUT I BELIEVE IN

03:48:45.612 --> 03:48:48.648 region:rollup2
ALL OF US HERE. DECIDE HOW MUCH

03:48:47.647 --> 03:48:50.517 region:rollup2
WEIGHT SHOULD BE AND DECIDE WHAT

03:48:48.648 --> 03:48:51.685 region:rollup2
THE COSTS RIDERS ARE IS TO GET

03:48:50.517 --> 03:48:53.253 region:rollup2
EXPERTS AND GET A COMMISSION

ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY AND SHINE A

03:49:12.339 --> 03:49:14.841 region:rollup2
LIGHT ON THOSE AREAS THAT

03:49:14.207 --> 03:49:16.142 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE HAVE CONTROL OVER AND

03:49:14.841 --> 03:49:18.211 region:rollup2
NOT.

03:49:16.142 --> 03:49:19.279 region:rollup2
EXPOSE THEM UNSELFISHLY THE

03:49:18.211 --> 03:49:21.314 region:rollup2
PHARMACEUTICALS AND SHOULD YOUR

LAST YEAR IS A GREAT START. BUT

03:49:23.183 --> 03:49:26.186 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS COMMISSION WE CAN

03:49:24.184 --> 03:49:27.554 region:rollup2
FURTHER EXPOSED THAT'S THE

03:49:26.186 --> 03:49:28.455 region:rollup2
THOUGH TRUE COST DRIVER.

03:49:27.554 --> 03:49:29.956 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT THE DOCTORS IN THIS

03:49:28.455 --> 03:49:31.391 region:rollup2

AND WE CAN THEN TURN OUR

03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:38.665 region:rollup2
ATTENTION AND FOCUS ON THAT BUT

03:49:36.663 --> 03:49:40.266 region:rollup2
WHICH DOES AFFECT THE RATES.

03:49:38.665 --> 03:49:41.635 region:rollup2
AS TO.

03:49:40.266 --> 03:49:43.036 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST QUESTION WAS

03:49:41.635 --> 03:49:44.170 region:rollup2
POSED A QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT THE

03:49:43.036 --> 03:49:45.338 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE OF THE KID AND I

03:49:44.170 --> 03:49:46.773 region:rollup2
COMMISSION I THINK A LOT'S BEEN

03:49:45.338 --> 03:49:48.742 region:rollup2
SAID THAT THIS COMMISSION CAN'T

03:49:46.773 --> 03:49:49.342 region:rollup2
PROPERLY SET RATES ARE THAT WILL

03:49:48.742 --> 03:49:51.745 region:rollup2
FALL BEHIND OUR THAT APPEALS

03:49:49.342 --> 03:49:53.079 region:rollup2
WILL BE. SORT OF UNREAL THE.

03:49:51.745 --> 03:49:54.114 region:rollup2
SURE THIS NINE MEMBER

03:49:53.079 --> 03:49:55.949 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

03:49:54.114 --> 03:49:57.884 region:rollup2
IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT SURE

03:49:55.949 --> 03:49:59.019 region:rollup2
IT'S IDEA BEHIND THIS IS THAT IT

03:49:57.884 --> 03:50:02.289 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A LIVING WAGE.

03:49:59.019 --> 03:50:03.990 region:rollup2
AND BEFORE WE EVEN GOT TO RATES

03:50:02.289 --> 03:50:05.458 region:rollup2
WE DO TAKE A LEAST THREE YEARS.

03:50:03.990 --> 03:50:07.360 region:rollup2
OF A IN GETTING DATA.

03:50:05.458 --> 03:50:09.062 region:rollup2
AND AND GETTING REAL DATA THAT

03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:10.964 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE TO HELP TO ESTABLISH

03:50:09.062 --> 03:50:12.332 region:rollup2
THE RATES ONCE RATES ARE SET THE

03:50:10.964 --> 03:50:13.667 region:rollup2
REEVALUATED EVERY YEAR THEY ARE

03:50:12.332 --> 03:50:15.235 region:rollup2
JUST OF EVERY YEAR COST LIVING

03:50:13.667 --> 03:50:16.636 region:rollup2
GO DIG INTO GENERAL COST OF

03:50:15.235 --> 03:50:18.271 region:rollup2
LIVING INCREASES. THINKING TO

03:50:16.636 --> 03:50:19.839 region:rollup2
RATES OF THE UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS I

03:50:18.271 --> 03:50:21.274 region:rollup2
JUST DID A LABOR AGREEMENT AND

03:50:19.839 --> 03:50:22.876 region:rollup2
COST ONE UPPER ONE AT ONE

03:50:21.274 --> 03:50:27.314 region:rollup2
SEGMENT OF THE LABOR FORCE. AND

03:50:22.876 --> 03:50:27.981 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A LIVING COMMISSION.

03:50:27.314 --> 03:50:28.648 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT A COMMISSION IS GOING

03:50:27.981 --> 03:50:30.150 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT EVERY FIVE YEARS IT'S

03:50:28.648 --> 03:50:32.385 region:rollup2
AN ANNUAL REVIEW AT AND THEN

03:50:30.150 --> 03:50:35.155 region:rollup2
ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT OF RATES.

03:50:32.385 --> 03:50:35.855 region:rollup2
I'M DEFICIT OBSERVED.

03:50:35.155 --> 03:50:38.525 region:rollup2
MISTER MISTER BY MAY.

03:50:35.855 --> 03:50:39.926 region:rollup2
.

03:50:38.525 --> 03:50:40.894 region:rollup2
SO EAT DE.

03:50:39.926 --> 03:50:42.829 region:rollup2
THE CASSETTE COMMISSION

03:50:40.894 --> 03:50:44.864 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE WAS VERY MUCH BASED

03:50:42.829 --> 03:50:45.899 region:rollup2
ON SUCCESSFUL MODELS THAT COVER

03:50:44.864 --> 03:50:49.002 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:50:45.899 --> 03:50:51.037 region:rollup2
SO WHICH IS INDEPENDENT.

03:50:49.002 --> 03:50:52.972 region:rollup2
HAS STRONG CONFLICT OF OF

03:50:51.037 --> 03:50:55.542 region:rollup2
INTEREST STANDARDS.

03:50:52.972 --> 03:50:58.011 region:rollup2
AND IS MADE UP OF EXPERTS

03:50:55.542 --> 03:50:59.979 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IN HEALTH CARE FINANCING

03:50:58.011 --> 03:51:01.715 region:rollup2
AND HEALTH CARE ECONOMICS IN A

03:50:59.979 --> 03:51:03.083 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND

03:51:01.715 --> 03:51:03.616 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BASED ON SOME OF THE

03:51:03.083 --> 03:51:05.719 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN MARYLAND OF

03:51:03.616 --> 03:51:08.188 region:rollup2
HAVING.

03:51:05.719 --> 03:51:09.689 region:rollup2
AN INDEPENDENT BOY THAT HAS

03:51:08.188 --> 03:51:12.325 region:rollup2
BUILT FLEXIBILITY INDEPENDENCE

03:51:09.689 --> 03:51:14.160 region:rollup2
AND AUTHORITY TO REACT

03:51:12.325 --> 03:51:17.097 region:rollup2
THE CHANGES IN THE MARKET.

03:51:14.160 --> 03:51:18.264 region:rollup2
AND TO SET RATES.

03:51:17.097 --> 03:51:20.600 region:rollup2
WITH THE GUIDANCE THAT THE

03:51:18.264 --> 03:51:21.668 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE SETS OUT IN TERMS OF

03:51:20.600 --> 03:51:23.103 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE

03:51:21.668 --> 03:51:26.406 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS FOR.

03:51:23.103 --> 03:51:27.907 region:rollup2
BUT HAS THAT EXPERTISE AND

03:51:26.406 --> 03:51:29.209 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENCE THE OTHER THING IS

03:51:27.907 --> 03:51:30.076 region:rollup2
IS THAT THERE IS AN ADVISORY

03:51:29.209 --> 03:51:32.512 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

03:51:30.076 --> 03:51:34.681 region:rollup2
WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ME AND

03:51:32.512 --> 03:51:36.950 region:rollup2
GIVE ADVICE AND INPUT TO THAT

03:51:34.681 --> 03:51:38.251 region:rollup2
COMMISSION THAT IS MADE UP OF

03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:39.819 region:rollup2
MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH CARE

03:51:38.251 --> 03:51:41.988 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THEIR VOICES ARE

03:51:39.819 --> 03:51:43.089 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IN SETTING

03:51:41.988 --> 03:51:45.091 region:rollup2
THESE RATES.

03:51:43.089 --> 03:51:47.560 region:rollup2
AND THE AUTHOR IS ACCEPTING

03:51:45.091 --> 03:51:49.195 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ADD EVEN.

03:51:47.560 --> 03:51:50.730 region:rollup2
MORE PROVIDERS LIKE SPECIFY

03:51:49.195 --> 03:51:53.333 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS SUCH AS PRIMARY CARE

03:51:50.730 --> 03:51:55.168 region:rollup2
DOCTORS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I'M A

03:51:53.333 --> 03:51:57.337 region:rollup2
SOLO PRACTITIONER. BECAUSE THAT

03:51:55.168 --> 03:51:59.005 region:rollup2
IS AN IMPORTANT VOICE SO ALL OF

03:51:57.337 --> 03:52:01.141 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE PART OF THE

03:51:59.005 --> 03:52:03.243 region:rollup2
ADVISORY COMMITTEE EXPERTS ON

03:52:01.141 --> 03:52:05.945 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION. AND IN SETTING

03:52:03.243 --> 03:52:07.714 region:rollup2
THE PACE AMOUNTS THE COMMISSION

03:52:05.945 --> 03:52:09.549 region:rollup2
WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT WRITTEN

03:52:07.714 --> 03:52:12.318 region:rollup2
TESTIMONY THERE WILL BE A

03:52:09.549 --> 03:52:15.188 region:rollup2
PROCESS WHERE THE STAKEHOLDERS

03:52:12.318 --> 03:52:16.756 region:rollup2
GO IN AND TALK ABOUT. WHY

03:52:15.188 --> 03:52:19.759 region:rollup2
CERTAIN RATES NEED TO BE A

03:52:16.756 --> 03:52:21.861 region:rollup2
CERTAIN WAY SO ALL OF THAT IS IS

03:52:19.759 --> 03:52:23.263 region:rollup2
BAKED INTO THE PROCESS?

03:52:21.861 --> 03:52:24.798 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S GUIDANCE INTO WHAT

03:52:23.263 --> 03:52:26.833 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY NEED TO TAKE INTO

03:52:24.798 --> 03:52:30.537 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT SO IT HAS INDEPENDENCE

03:52:26.833 --> 03:52:31.771 region:rollup2
BUT HAS GUARD RAILS TO MAKE SURE

03:52:30.537 --> 03:52:33.673 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS.

03:52:31.771 --> 03:52:36.709 region:rollup2
AFFECTED UPS AND THEN ALSO WITH

03:52:33.673 --> 03:52:38.778 region:rollup2
THE GLOBAL CAP THAT IS BASICALLY

03:52:36.709 --> 03:52:40.346 region:rollup2
AWAY FOR THE COMMISSION TO KIND

03:52:38.778 --> 03:52:41.781 region:rollup2
OF TRACK ARE THEIR SPIKES IN

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:44.617 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE THEIR

03:52:41.781 --> 03:52:46.586 region:rollup2
SPIKES IN. VOLUME ARE THERE

03:52:44.617 --> 03:52:47.821 region:rollup2
OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE GOING ON

03:52:46.586 --> 03:52:50.457 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COMMISSION NEEDS TO

03:52:47.821 --> 03:52:51.825 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT WOULD CAUSE THERE

03:52:50.457 --> 03:52:52.759 region:rollup2
TO BE AN ADJUSTMENT IN THE BASE

03:52:51.825 --> 03:52:54.227 region:rollup2
AMOUNT.

03:52:52.759 --> 03:52:56.696 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THE IDEA BEHIND

03:52:54.227 --> 03:52:57.864 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE.

03:52:56.696 --> 03:52:59.466 region:rollup2
THANK YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CHAIR

03:52:57.864 --> 03:53:01.167 region:rollup2
IF IF THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS

03:52:59.466 --> 03:53:02.802 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MEDI CAL STUFF.

03:53:01.167 --> 03:53:04.037 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:53:02.802 --> 03:53:05.338 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MRS THURMAN APPRECIATE

03:53:04.037 --> 03:53:06.539 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY RESPOND.

03:53:05.338 --> 03:53:08.007 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL THERE'S BEEN A LOT

03:53:06.539 --> 03:53:09.809 region:rollup2
OF INTERESTING IDEAS PUT OUT

03:53:08.007 --> 03:53:10.443 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW TO INCREASE MEDI CAL

03:53:09.809 --> 03:53:11.945 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS BUT THEY'RE NOT IN

03:53:10.443 --> 03:53:12.745 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

03:53:11.945 --> 03:53:14.614 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY NOT IN THE

03:53:12.745 --> 03:53:16.483 region:rollup2
BILL.

03:53:14.614 --> 03:53:18.551 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE.

03:53:16.483 --> 03:53:20.086 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT COMMERCIAL RATES

03:53:18.551 --> 03:53:21.955 region:rollup2
REALLY OFFSET LOSSES.

03:53:20.086 --> 03:53:23.756 region:rollup2
COME TO MY OFFICE COME TO THE

03:53:21.955 --> 03:53:25.024 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AROUND ME. THE ONLY

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:26.526 region:rollup2
REASON I CAN SEE MEDI CAL

03:53:25.024 --> 03:53:28.228 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IS BECAUSE I TAKE

03:53:26.526 --> 03:53:29.162 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES.

03:53:28.228 --> 03:53:30.430 region:rollup2
I WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS AND

03:53:29.162 --> 03:53:32.131 region:rollup2
IN FACT.

03:53:30.430 --> 03:53:33.233 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN I SHUT MY

03:53:32.131 --> 03:53:34.801 region:rollup2
DOOR TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE

03:53:33.233 --> 03:53:35.869 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PROGRAM.

03:53:34.801 --> 03:53:37.437 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE LAST

03:53:35.869 --> 03:53:39.672 region:rollup2
THE ANTI PHYSICIANS IN SAN DIEGO

03:53:37.437 --> 03:53:41.474 region:rollup2
COUNTY STILL SEEING THOSE FOLKS.

03:53:39.672 --> 03:53:42.208 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE BANKRUPTING MAY

03:53:41.474 --> 03:53:43.142 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE

03:53:42.208 --> 03:53:44.744 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PATIENTS TO OFFSET MY

03:53:43.142 --> 03:53:46.513 region:rollup2
LOSSES.

03:53:44.744 --> 03:53:47.847 region:rollup2
SO IT IS SIMPLY TRUE.

03:53:46.513 --> 03:53:48.781 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS AN OFFSET THAT THE

03:53:47.847 --> 03:53:50.650 region:rollup2
STATE IS PUTTING ON THE

03:53:48.781 --> 03:53:51.217 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES.

03:53:50.650 --> 03:53:52.685 region:rollup2
WE CAN GIVE YOU THE DATE I'M

03:53:51.217 --> 03:53:55.221 region:rollup2
SURE.

03:53:52.685 --> 03:53:55.822 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS COMMENTS HERE ABOUT

03:53:55.221 --> 03:53:58.091 region:rollup2
THE CONSOLIDATION DRIVING UP

03:53:55.822 --> 03:53:59.859 region:rollup2
COSTS.

03:53:58.091 --> 03:54:01.628 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD INCREASE

03:53:59.859 --> 03:54:03.463 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION DOCTORS LIKE

03:54:01.628 --> 03:54:05.632 region:rollup2
MYSELF IN THE LATTER PART OF OUR

03:54:03.463 --> 03:54:07.634 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND I WILL TELL YOU I

03:54:05.632 --> 03:54:08.101 region:rollup2
WILL BE ONE OF THOSE DOCTORS

03:54:07.634 --> 03:54:09.602 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK TO AN EARLY

03:54:08.101 --> 03:54:10.803 region:rollup2
RETIREMENT.

03:54:09.602 --> 03:54:11.971 region:rollup2
I PRACTICE THIRTY YEARS I COULD

03:54:10.803 --> 03:54:13.339 region:rollup2
PROBABLY PRACTICE ANOTHER FIVE

03:54:11.971 --> 03:54:15.008 region:rollup2
TO TEN.

03:54:13.339 --> 03:54:17.477 region:rollup2
AS A SOLO PRACTITIONER MY ONLY

03:54:15.008 --> 03:54:18.845 region:rollup2
OPTIONS UNDER THIS BILL ASSUMING

03:54:17.477 --> 03:54:19.979 region:rollup2
THAT WE SEE THE SAME BEHAVIORS

03:54:18.845 --> 03:54:21.047 region:rollup2
BY THE LEGISLATURE SETTING RIGHT

03:54:19.979 --> 03:54:22.982 region:rollup2
OR THIS. THIS WITH A PANEL

03:54:21.047 --> 03:54:23.850 region:rollup2
SETTING RIGHTS.

03:54:22.982 --> 03:54:25.485 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO JOIN A LARGER

03:54:23.850 --> 03:54:26.719 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION FURTHER INCREASING

03:54:25.485 --> 03:54:28.454 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION.

03:54:26.719 --> 03:54:31.558 region:rollup2
OR CLOSE MY PRACTICE

03:54:28.454 --> 03:54:32.659 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION DRIVES UP PRICES.

03:54:31.558 --> 03:54:33.927 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO

03:54:32.659 --> 03:54:35.762 region:rollup2
PUSH PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

03:54:33.927 --> 03:54:37.964 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

03:54:35.762 --> 03:54:39.465 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW THIS COMMISSION

03:54:37.964 --> 03:54:40.533 region:rollup2
WOULD WORK TO WATCH AND MAKE

03:54:39.465 --> 03:54:42.068 region:rollup2
SURE THESE ARE REASONABLE RATES

03:54:40.533 --> 03:54:43.836 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH INCREASED LABOR

03:54:42.068 --> 03:54:45.471 region:rollup2
COSTS AND INCREASE INFLATION.

03:54:43.836 --> 03:54:46.105 region:rollup2
LET ME REMIND EVERYBODY IN THE

03:54:45.471 --> 03:54:47.440 region:rollup2
ROOM ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE

03:54:46.105 --> 03:54:49.108 region:rollup2
SG ARE.

03:54:47.440 --> 03:54:49.642 region:rollup2
AND THE DOC FIX THAT WE HAD TO

03:54:49.108 --> 03:54:51.611 region:rollup2
GO AFTER EVERY YEAR FOR A

03:54:49.642 --> 03:54:53.479 region:rollup2
DECADE.

03:54:51.611 --> 03:54:54.847 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MEDICARE WAS ALSO GOING

03:54:53.479 --> 03:54:56.649 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE OF THOSE THINGS AND

03:54:54.847 --> 03:54:57.584 region:rollup2
NEVER DID.

03:54:56.649 --> 03:54:58.618 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL

03:54:57.584 --> 03:54:59.953 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:54:58.618 --> 03:55:01.921 region:rollup2
SPARE CASH THEN THE STATE HAS

03:54:59.953 --> 03:55:03.790 region:rollup2
NEVER COME UP WITH. TO MAKE UP

03:55:01.921 --> 03:55:05.692 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE LOSSES YEAR AFTER YEAR

03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:07.026 region:rollup2
AND KEEP DOCTORS OFFICE OPEN.

03:55:05.692 --> 03:55:08.861 region:rollup2
FOR MEDICARE AND I WILL REMIND

03:55:07.026 --> 03:55:10.129 region:rollup2
ALSO THAT THERE ARE COUNTIES IN

03:55:08.861 --> 03:55:11.664 region:rollup2
THIS STATE.

03:55:10.129 --> 03:55:12.165 region:rollup2
THAT COULD NOT HAVE THAT THERE

03:55:11.664 --> 03:55:14.467 region:rollup2
WAS NO PATIENT ENTERING

03:55:12.165 --> 03:55:15.768 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

03:55:14.467 --> 03:55:17.203 region:rollup2
THAT COULD FIND OPPOSITION

03:55:15.768 --> 03:55:18.905 region:rollup2
ACCEPTING THEM PARTICULARLY IN

03:55:17.203 --> 03:55:20.206 region:rollup2
SPECIALTIES LIKE ORTHOPEDICS

03:55:18.905 --> 03:55:22.175 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T COVER

03:55:20.206 --> 03:55:23.943 region:rollup2
THE COSTS OF CARE THE DOCTORS

03:55:22.175 --> 03:55:25.945 region:rollup2
WERE NOT WILLING TO SEE MEDICARE

03:55:23.943 --> 03:55:27.680 region:rollup2
LET ALONE MEDIC CALATHUS RATES.

03:55:25.945 --> 03:55:30.316 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF GLOBAL BUDGETING.

03:55:27.680 --> 03:55:32.085 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T INCLUDE PHARMA.

03:55:30.316 --> 03:55:34.087 region:rollup2
IN ANY PART OF THIS BILL.

03:55:32.085 --> 03:55:36.122 region:rollup2
HOW DO U. GLOBALLY BUDGET AND

03:55:34.087 --> 03:55:37.590 region:rollup2
NOT END UP CUTTING PAYMENT?

03:55:36.122 --> 03:55:39.058 region:rollup2
TO PHYSICIANS HOSPITALS DENTISTS

03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:40.326 region:rollup2
AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

03:55:39.058 --> 03:55:41.961 region:rollup2
WHEN FORMA INCREASES ARE STILL

03:55:40.326 --> 03:55:43.296 region:rollup2
OUT OF CONTROL.

03:55:41.961 --> 03:55:45.064 region:rollup2
FINALLY THE IDEA OF AN APPEALS

03:55:43.296 --> 03:55:46.132 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

03:55:45.064 --> 03:55:46.1000 region:rollup2
MANY OF YOU ARE PROBABLY

03:55:46.132 --> 03:55:48.568 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH INDEPENDENT

03:55:46.1000 --> 03:55:50.103 region:rollup2
DISPUTE RESOLUTION THAT'S COME

03:55:48.568 --> 03:55:51.604 region:rollup2
UP MANY TIMES BEFORE.

03:55:50.103 --> 03:55:52.705 region:rollup2
IT IS A FAILED PROCESS IN MANY

03:55:51.604 --> 03:55:54.507 region:rollup2
WAYS BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL

03:55:52.705 --> 03:55:56.442 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS OR EVEN SMALL

03:55:54.507 --> 03:55:57.944 region:rollup2
GROUPS OF PRACTITIONERS SIMPLY

03:55:56.442 --> 03:56:00.113 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE TIME AND THE

03:55:57.944 --> 03:56:02.015 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO GO AFTER

03:56:00.113 --> 03:56:03.983 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS CURRENTLY. THAT ARE

03:56:02.015 --> 03:56:05.885 region:rollup2
UNDER PAYING CLAIMS OR REFUSING

03:56:03.983 --> 03:56:07.754 region:rollup2
TO PAY REASONABLE CLAIMS FOR

03:56:05.885 --> 03:56:09.155 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE.

03:56:07.754 --> 03:56:10.623 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO EXPECTATION THAT

03:56:09.155 --> 03:56:12.191 region:rollup2
SMALLER PRACTICES AND EVEN

03:56:10.623 --> 03:56:13.426 region:rollup2
MEDIUM SIZED PRACTICES ARE GONNA

03:56:12.191 --> 03:56:14.994 region:rollup2
HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO GO UP

03:56:13.426 --> 03:56:16.929 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE COMMISSION.

03:56:14.994 --> 03:56:17.697 region:rollup2
THAT HAS AT THIS TIME ORIGINALLY

03:56:16.929 --> 03:56:19.365 region:rollup2
OUT OF NINE MEMBERS KNOW

03:56:17.697 --> 03:56:21.134 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS.

03:56:19.365 --> 03:56:23.136 region:rollup2
AND NOW MAYBE ONE PHYSICIAN ON A

03:56:21.134 --> 03:56:24.771 region:rollup2
PANEL OF ELEVEN.

03:56:23.136 --> 03:56:25.772 region:rollup2
THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE BEFORE

03:56:24.771 --> 03:56:27.740 region:rollup2
THIS BILL HAS ANY SENSE TO IT.

03:56:25.772 --> 03:56:29.008 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:30.343 region:rollup2
AND IF I MAY ADD ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:56:29.008 --> 03:56:32.412 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

03:56:30.343 --> 03:56:34.147 region:rollup2
THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAW HERE IS

03:56:32.412 --> 03:56:37.717 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL THIS APPROACH.

03:56:34.147 --> 03:56:39.385 region:rollup2
ATTACKS ONLY ONE ASPECT.

03:56:37.717 --> 03:56:40.253 region:rollup2
SPENDING IN PRICING DOES ADDRESS

03:56:39.385 --> 03:56:43.056 region:rollup2
MEDICARE DOESN'T ADDRESS

03:56:40.253 --> 03:56:44.924 region:rollup2
MEDICAID. WE ARE NOW ON A RACE

03:56:43.056 --> 03:56:46.125 region:rollup2
TO THE BOTTOM.

03:56:44.924 --> 03:56:48.194 region:rollup2
IT ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO

03:56:46.125 --> 03:56:49.295 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

03:56:48.194 --> 03:56:50.730 region:rollup2
FROM A HOSPITAL ORGANIZATIONS

03:56:49.295 --> 03:56:52.598 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE THE PLANNING THAT IS

03:56:50.730 --> 03:56:54.801 region:rollup2
NEEDED.

03:56:52.598 --> 03:56:55.968 region:rollup2
TO OPERATE A SIGNIFICANT

03:56:54.801 --> 03:56:57.703 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION ONE WHY MEAN BY

03:56:55.968 --> 03:56:59.505 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:56:57.703 --> 03:57:01.307 region:rollup2
IN MARYLAND THE RATE SETTING

03:56:59.505 --> 03:57:03.409 region:rollup2
COMMISSION FOCUSED ON RATES OF

03:57:01.307 --> 03:57:05.945 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

03:57:03.409 --> 03:57:07.313 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSES TO READ BASS

03:57:05.945 --> 03:57:10.416 region:rollup2
THE RATES AT WHICH HOSPITAL'S

03:57:07.313 --> 03:57:12.785 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS AND OTHERS ARE SET.

03:57:10.416 --> 03:57:13.219 region:rollup2
FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT EMPLOYS

03:57:12.785 --> 03:57:15.054 region:rollup2
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:57:13.219 --> 03:57:16.422 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

03:57:15.054 --> 03:57:17.657 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO PLAN NOT ONLY FOR

03:57:16.422 --> 03:57:18.791 region:rollup2
THE CARE THEY'RE PROVIDING TODAY

03:57:17.657 --> 03:57:21.260 region:rollup2
BUT THE CARE THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:57:18.791 --> 03:57:23.196 region:rollup2
PROVIDING IN FIVE TO TEN YEARS

03:57:21.260 --> 03:57:24.097 region:rollup2
WITH BOARDS OF TRUSTEES FROM THE

03:57:23.196 --> 03:57:25.898 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHO GOVERN THOSE

03:57:24.097 --> 03:57:27.767 region:rollup2
DECISIONS.

03:57:25.898 --> 03:57:28.835 region:rollup2
THEY CAN'T WAIT TO NO THREE

03:57:27.767 --> 03:57:30.269 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE DAYS AT A

03:57:28.835 --> 03:57:31.771 region:rollup2
TIME.

03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:33.372 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PAID

03:57:31.771 --> 03:57:35.041 region:rollup2
FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED

03:57:33.372 --> 03:57:37.243 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE

03:57:35.041 --> 03:57:39.045 region:rollup2
SO THIS SYSTEM IS NOT ONLY NOT

03:57:37.243 --> 03:57:41.514 region:rollup2
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

03:57:39.045 --> 03:57:43.182 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING COSTS OF CARE? LABOR

03:57:41.514 --> 03:57:45.384 region:rollup2
DRUGS AND ALL THE REST THE

03:57:43.182 --> 03:57:46.352 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF SUBSIDY THAT'S NEEDED.

03:57:45.384 --> 03:57:48.221 region:rollup2
AND AS THE PROPONENTS HAVE

03:57:46.352 --> 03:57:50.056 region:rollup2
ARGUED IF YOU'RE A HOSPITAL

03:57:48.221 --> 03:57:52.258 region:rollup2
TREATING THE LARGE NUMBERS OF

03:57:50.056 --> 03:57:54.227 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS.

03:57:52.258 --> 03:57:56.529 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE NO PATIENCE TO SHIFT

03:57:54.227 --> 03:57:58.631 region:rollup2
THOSE UNFUNDED COSTS TO AND

03:57:56.529 --> 03:58:00.333 region:rollup2
THEIR WORKING DAY BY DAY TO MAKE

03:57:58.631 --> 03:58:01.901 region:rollup2
ENDS MEET BUT THE SYSTEM

03:58:00.333 --> 03:58:03.336 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY DOES NOT TAKE INTO

03:58:01.901 --> 03:58:05.238 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THE PLANNING. THAT'S

03:58:03.336 --> 03:58:06.973 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO TAKE CARE DELIVERY

03:58:05.238 --> 03:58:08.541 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NEED IT TO BE. IN

03:58:06.973 --> 03:58:10.343 region:rollup2
MARYLAND ONE OF THE FLAWS OF THE

03:58:08.541 --> 03:58:13.379 region:rollup2
RATE SETTING SYSTEM IS THAT

03:58:10.343 --> 03:58:15.548 region:rollup2
MARYLAND HAD AN OLDER.

03:58:13.379 --> 03:58:17.283 region:rollup2
SET OF CAPITAL OLDER HOSPITALS

03:58:15.548 --> 03:58:18.618 region:rollup2
OLDER FACILITIES BECAUSE IT

03:58:17.283 --> 03:58:20.586 region:rollup2
WASN'T UNTIL THE RATE SETTING

03:58:18.618 --> 03:58:22.355 region:rollup2
COMMISSION RELEASED FUNDS. THAT

03:58:20.586 --> 03:58:25.057 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS COULD THEN PLANET TEN

03:58:22.355 --> 03:58:27.393 region:rollup2
YEAR CYCLE. OF REPLACING THAT

03:58:25.057 --> 03:58:29.328 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL PLANT SO THERE IS MUCH

03:58:27.393 --> 03:58:31.063 region:rollup2
TO BE LEARNED I BELIEVE FROM THE

03:58:29.328 --> 03:58:32.698 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT THERE THIS

03:58:31.063 --> 03:58:33.800 region:rollup2
BILL DOES NOT DO. MAKES YOU

03:58:32.698 --> 03:58:39.205 region:rollup2
WON'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS WAS

03:58:33.800 --> 03:58:41.941 region:rollup2
INTERESTING ABOUT COUNT.

03:58:39.205 --> 03:58:44.744 region:rollup2
LABOR COSTS DRUG COSTS IN OTHER

03:58:41.941 --> 03:58:45.845 region:rollup2
COSTS BUT THE AUTHOR DID SAY

03:58:44.744 --> 03:58:47.680 region:rollup2
THAT THE STRUCTURE CREATES A WAY

03:58:45.845 --> 03:58:49.415 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL DRUG COSTS

03:58:47.680 --> 03:58:51.050 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE. AND HAS BUILT IN A

03:58:49.415 --> 03:58:52.652 region:rollup2
WAY TO ADDRESS WITH LABOR COSTS

03:58:51.050 --> 03:58:53.920 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WHAT'S

03:58:52.652 --> 03:58:55.421 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING IS THAT WE'VE HEARD

03:58:53.920 --> 03:58:56.489 region:rollup2
FROM TWO SIDES ON THE SAME

03:58:55.421 --> 03:58:58.157 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND THEY'RE CITING

03:58:56.489 --> 03:58:59.358 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE THAT'S DATA.

03:58:58.157 --> 03:59:00.560 region:rollup2
BUT A BUT THE AUTHOR DID

03:58:59.358 --> 03:59:01.527 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT THERE'S A WAY TO

03:59:00.560 --> 03:59:02.962 region:rollup2
ADDRESS LABOR COSTS IN DRUG

03:59:01.527 --> 03:59:04.797 region:rollup2
COSTS AND SO.

03:59:02.962 --> 03:59:05.832 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THERE'S SOME CHALLENGES

03:59:04.797 --> 03:59:08.100 region:rollup2
HERE BUT I THINK THERE'S

03:59:05.832 --> 03:59:10.937 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CREATIVE TO WORK WITH

03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:11.537 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN I THINK

03:59:10.937 --> 03:59:11.837 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES THREE QUESTIONS YOU

03:59:11.537 --> 03:59:19.011 region:rollup2
CREATIVELY.

03:59:11.837 --> 03:59:21.414 region:rollup2
TO BIGELOW.

03:59:19.011 --> 03:59:23.749 region:rollup2
THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR.

03:59:21.414 --> 03:59:24.350 region:rollup2
I FIND IT.

03:59:23.749 --> 03:59:25.218 region:rollup2
LIKE MANY MEMBERS HERE A KIND

03:59:24.350 --> 03:59:27.854 region:rollup2
OF.

03:59:25.218 --> 03:59:28.821 region:rollup2
IF USING SCENARIO HERE.

03:59:27.854 --> 03:59:29.956 region:rollup2
AND WHEN I TRIED TO LOOK AT THIS

03:59:28.821 --> 03:59:30.856 region:rollup2
AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE

03:59:29.956 --> 03:59:32.225 region:rollup2
ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:59:30.856 --> 03:59:35.261 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

03:59:32.225 --> 03:59:37.964 region:rollup2
BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND HOSPITALS.

03:59:35.261 --> 03:59:38.831 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO BE.

03:59:37.964 --> 03:59:40.833 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA BE A STAGGERING

03:59:38.831 --> 03:59:42.101 region:rollup2
NUMBER WHO ALL HAVE INDIVIDUAL

03:59:40.833 --> 03:59:44.604 region:rollup2
SOCIO ECONOMIC.

03:59:42.101 --> 03:59:46.539 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

03:59:44.604 --> 03:59:49.675 region:rollup2
DOES YOUR.

03:59:46.539 --> 03:59:51.210 region:rollup2
I'LL CONTEMPLATE. A SEPARATELY.

03:59:49.675 --> 03:59:52.111 region:rollup2
PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR EACH

03:59:51.210 --> 03:59:54.747 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR AND HEALTH

03:59:52.111 --> 03:59:56.115 region:rollup2
PLAN.

03:59:54.747 --> 03:59:57.850 region:rollup2
YEAH DOT NODDED FOR EVERY

03:59:56.115 --> 03:59:59.719 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR. THEN HOW WILL

03:59:57.850 --> 04:00:01.420 region:rollup2
THEY BE ABLE HOW WILL ANY

03:59:59.719 --> 04:00:03.589 region:rollup2
SUCCESS COME FROM THIS IF YOU'RE

04:00:01.420 --> 04:00:05.992 region:rollup2
NOT ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

04:00:03.589 --> 04:00:08.361 region:rollup2
THE LABOR COSTS THE AND THE

04:00:05.992 --> 04:00:11.097 region:rollup2
PATIENT LOAD.

04:00:08.361 --> 04:00:12.732 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT?

04:00:11.097 --> 04:00:13.966 region:rollup2
ITALIAN HOW IN THE* SO. AS

04:00:12.732 --> 04:00:15.735 region:rollup2
MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES LABOR

04:00:13.966 --> 04:00:17.770 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND

04:00:15.735 --> 04:00:19.272 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE

04:00:17.770 --> 04:00:21.140 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED IN THE BASE ADJUSTMENT

04:00:19.272 --> 04:00:22.608 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN AN APPEAL. BUT ACTUALLY

04:00:21.140 --> 04:00:25.211 region:rollup2
A BASS ADJUSTMENT AND THEIR.

04:00:22.608 --> 04:00:26.379 region:rollup2
IS A LARGE SCALE OPERATION HAS

04:00:25.211 --> 04:00:28.014 region:rollup2
A LOT OF LABOR WHERE THEY DO

04:00:26.379 --> 04:00:29.382 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A BARGAINING UNIT. AND

04:00:28.014 --> 04:00:30.716 region:rollup2
THE CONTRACTS WE APPLAUD THAT

04:00:29.382 --> 04:00:35.655 region:rollup2
CAN BE FACTORED IN TO A RATE

04:00:30.716 --> 04:00:37.857 region:rollup2
INCREASE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL BUT.

04:00:35.655 --> 04:00:38.691 region:rollup2
.

04:00:37.857 --> 04:00:41.827 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW IF

04:00:38.691 --> 04:00:43.596 region:rollup2
I CAN BUY DIFFER ON HOW MEDICARE

04:00:41.827 --> 04:00:44.764 region:rollup2
WORKS HOW MEDICARE RATES ARE SET

04:00:43.596 --> 04:00:45.798 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAS NOT LET EVERY DOCTOR

04:00:44.764 --> 04:00:47.333 region:rollup2
HAS INDIVIDUAL MEDICARE WAIT

04:00:45.798 --> 04:00:48.634 region:rollup2
THEY GET. IT'S ALSO BASE OUR

04:00:47.333 --> 04:00:49.669 region:rollup2
REGION SPACE ON COST ADJUSTMENT

04:00:48.634 --> 04:00:50.503 region:rollup2
OR WHAT HAVE YOU RIGHT BEFORE

04:00:49.669 --> 04:00:52.972 region:rollup2
YOU RESPOND THAT CLEARLY IT'S A

04:00:50.503 --> 04:00:53.539 region:rollup2
ONE ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

04:00:52.972 --> 04:00:54.240 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY AND WHAT YOU'RE

04:00:53.539 --> 04:00:55.741 region:rollup2
OPENING THE DOOR TO IS A TENS OF

04:00:54.240 --> 04:00:58.444 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS

04:00:55.741 --> 04:01:00.212 region:rollup2
SOLUTION FOR A PLAN.

04:00:58.444 --> 04:01:02.648 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE CONFLICT

04:01:00.212 --> 04:01:04.150 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO THIS AND. AND I KNOW

04:01:02.648 --> 04:01:05.418 region:rollup2
YOU WANT RESPOND TO THAT BUT

04:01:04.150 --> 04:01:06.819 region:rollup2
WITH ONLY NINE MEMBERS

04:01:05.418 --> 04:01:09.822 region:rollup2
INCREASING GET ELEVEN.

04:01:06.819 --> 04:01:11.891 region:rollup2
IS A REALLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

04:01:09.822 --> 04:01:12.625 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR THIS COMMISSION TO

04:01:11.891 --> 04:01:14.994 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT MAGNITUDE OF AN

04:01:12.625 --> 04:01:16.996 region:rollup2
ISSUE A CHALLENGE.

04:01:14.994 --> 04:01:17.897 region:rollup2
IT'S IS A MAJOR ENDEAVOR AND

04:01:16.996 --> 04:01:20.066 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY IT WILL BE UP OF

04:01:17.897 --> 04:01:21.100 region:rollup2
FUNDED COMMISSION TO ALLOW STAFF

04:01:20.066 --> 04:01:22.201 region:rollup2
STARTUP TO THAT ADVISORY

04:01:21.100 --> 04:01:24.103 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE. TO HELP PROVIDE

04:01:22.201 --> 04:01:26.372 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ALLOW FOR A PROCESS

04:01:24.103 --> 04:01:27.907 region:rollup2
IS SET BOTH BASE RATES ADJUSTED

04:01:26.372 --> 04:01:30.876 region:rollup2
RATES AND ALLOW FOR AN APPEALS

04:01:27.907 --> 04:01:31.410 region:rollup2
PROCESS AS WELL. AYE IF THERE'S.

04:01:30.876 --> 04:01:33.112 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR NEED IT IS A

04:01:31.410 --> 04:01:34.080 region:rollup2
DOCTOR.

04:01:33.112 --> 04:01:35.581 region:rollup2
BUT A COUNTRY TO STOP THE NEEDS

04:01:34.080 --> 04:01:37.183 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE UP FACILITIES

04:01:35.581 --> 04:01:38.818 region:rollup2
ISSUES BUT THEY HAVE TO ACCOUNT

04:01:37.183 --> 04:01:40.586 region:rollup2
FOR. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS ARE

04:01:38.818 --> 04:01:42.421 region:rollup2
VERY INDIVIDUALIZED THAT FRANKLY

04:01:40.586 --> 04:01:43.856 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. IT'LL GET COMPENSATED

04:01:42.421 --> 04:01:47.560 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THE TAKE THAT OUT OF

04:01:43.856 --> 04:01:48.995 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN GENERAL FUND OF THEIR

04:01:47.560 --> 04:01:50.930 region:rollup2
ALL OF THEIR OPERATIONS.

04:01:48.995 --> 04:01:52.598 region:rollup2
AND SO AND THEIR DOCTORS SUCH AS

04:01:50.930 --> 04:01:54.200 region:rollup2
THE OUR OUR GOOD DOT HERE THE

04:01:52.598 --> 04:01:55.901 region:rollup2
RIGHT TESTIFIED SAYING. YOU KNOW

04:01:54.200 --> 04:01:56.936 region:rollup2
THE COMMERCIAL RATES.

04:01:55.901 --> 04:01:59.005 region:rollup2
HELP ME TO OFFSET OUR MEDICARE

04:01:56.936 --> 04:01:59.572 region:rollup2
MEDICAL MEDICARE MEDICAL RATES

04:01:59.005 --> 04:02:01.240 region:rollup2
WELL THEN WHO THE ACTOR THAT

04:01:59.572 --> 04:02:03.209 region:rollup2
CAN.

04:02:01.240 --> 04:02:04.910 region:rollup2
BE ANNOUNCED SO IF THAT'S THE

04:02:03.209 --> 04:02:05.544 region:rollup2
CASE IN THE REGION HE PRACTICES.

04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:06.145 region:rollup2
THEN THAT COULD VERY WELL BE

04:02:05.544 --> 04:02:07.613 region:rollup2
WHAT COMMERCIAL RATES ARE SET

04:02:06.145 --> 04:02:07.980 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT. CUTTING

04:02:07.613 --> 04:02:09.315 region:rollup2
AYE I KNOW THAT.

04:02:07.980 --> 04:02:10.249 region:rollup2
.

04:02:09.315 --> 04:02:11.851 region:rollup2
THERE THERE WAS A SUGGEST THAT

04:02:10.249 --> 04:02:12.885 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA RE BASS.

04:02:11.851 --> 04:02:15.588 region:rollup2
BUT THE RATES ARE THE REALITY IS

04:02:12.885 --> 04:02:17.523 region:rollup2
WE BATES IS NOT EQUAL REDUCE.

04:02:15.588 --> 04:02:19.392 region:rollup2
AND SO ON UP TO A DEFERRED TO

04:02:17.523 --> 04:02:21.494 region:rollup2
THIS AREA HERE ON THE POINT OF

04:02:19.392 --> 04:02:23.029 region:rollup2
HOW YOU ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL

04:02:21.494 --> 04:02:24.030 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL ICONS GIVEN THE FACT

04:02:23.029 --> 04:02:26.565 region:rollup2
THAT MEDICARE DOESN'T DO THAT.

04:02:24.030 --> 04:02:31.103 region:rollup2
BUT HOW WITH THIS ACCOUNT FOR

04:02:26.565 --> 04:02:31.904 region:rollup2
LOCALIZED DIFFERENCES IN CLASS.

04:02:31.103 --> 04:02:33.205 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIGELOW THAT'S AND AN

04:02:31.904 --> 04:02:34.607 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK

04:02:33.205 --> 04:02:36.142 region:rollup2
WHEN WE.

04:02:34.607 --> 04:02:36.709 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE CONTEMPLATING WHAT THE

04:02:36.142 --> 04:02:39.779 region:rollup2
AUTHOR THE STRUCTURE OF THIS

04:02:36.709 --> 04:02:42.014 region:rollup2
BILL WE REALIZE THAT THERE IS A

04:02:39.779 --> 04:02:43.449 region:rollup2
TRIED AND TRUE FORMULA OUT THERE

04:02:42.014 --> 04:02:45.618 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE WORKHORSE OF

04:02:43.449 --> 04:02:47.987 region:rollup2
MEDICARE. WE REALIZED WE DID NOT

04:02:45.618 --> 04:02:50.156 region:rollup2
NEED A COMMISSION TO REINVENT

04:02:47.987 --> 04:02:52.691 region:rollup2
THE WHEEL AND SAT AS YOU SAID

04:02:50.156 --> 04:02:54.427 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND DIFFERENT.

04:02:52.691 --> 04:02:55.928 region:rollup2
RATES FOR ALL THE PROVIDERS IN

04:02:54.427 --> 04:02:57.897 region:rollup2
THE STATE ESPECIALLY A STATE AS

04:02:55.928 --> 04:03:00.366 region:rollup2
LARGE AS AS CALIFORNIA. THE

04:02:57.897 --> 04:03:02.768 region:rollup2
MEDICARE SYSTEM DOES THE WORK

04:03:00.366 --> 04:03:04.970 region:rollup2
FOR US AND THAT'S WHY MEDICARE

04:03:02.768 --> 04:03:06.906 region:rollup2
IS USED AS THE BENCHMARK IN THE

04:03:04.970 --> 04:03:08.774 region:rollup2
BASIS FOR THE COMMISSION TO SET

04:03:06.906 --> 04:03:09.275 region:rollup2
RATES. MEDICARE TAKES INTO

04:03:08.774 --> 04:03:11.077 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT

04:03:09.275 --> 04:03:13.879 region:rollup2
COST

04:03:11.077 --> 04:03:15.915 region:rollup2
THE COST OF CARE LABOR COSTS IT

04:03:13.879 --> 04:03:18.117 region:rollup2
DOES ADJUSTMENTS FOR REGIONAL

04:03:15.915 --> 04:03:20.653 region:rollup2
WAGE DIFFERENCES IT LOOKS THAT

04:03:18.117 --> 04:03:22.555 region:rollup2
IF A FACILITY DOES MEDICAL

04:03:20.653 --> 04:03:24.557 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. IF THEY ALL HAVE A

04:03:22.555 --> 04:03:26.292 region:rollup2
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

04:03:24.557 --> 04:03:28.561 region:rollup2
MEDICAID OUT OR LOW INCOME

04:03:26.292 --> 04:03:30.229 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES AND EVEN DOES AN

04:03:28.561 --> 04:03:31.730 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PAYMENT IF THERE'S AN

04:03:30.229 --> 04:03:33.933 region:rollup2
OUT LIAR CASE IF THERE HAPPENS

04:03:31.730 --> 04:03:35.301 region:rollup2
TO BE A CASE WHERE. IT IS VERY

04:03:33.933 --> 04:03:37.770 region:rollup2
VERY EXPENSIVE.

04:03:35.301 --> 04:03:39.004 region:rollup2
EVEN DEALS WITH CRITICAL ACCESS

04:03:37.770 --> 04:03:40.506 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS

04:03:39.004 --> 04:03:41.474 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE HOSPITALS I BELIEVE

04:03:40.506 --> 04:03:44.310 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIRTY FOUR IN THE STATE

04:03:41.474 --> 04:03:46.512 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE IN. RURAL

04:03:44.310 --> 04:03:48.314 region:rollup2
AREAS AND THEIR SMALL HOSPITALS

04:03:46.512 --> 04:03:51.117 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY ARE THE ONLY SOURCE

04:03:48.314 --> 04:03:52.918 region:rollup2
OF CARE FOR MEDICARE ENROLLEES

04:03:51.117 --> 04:03:53.853 region:rollup2
AND SO A LOT OF THAT WORK IS

04:03:52.918 --> 04:03:56.822 region:rollup2
DONE.

04:03:53.853 --> 04:03:58.390 region:rollup2
AND SO MEDICAID PROVIDERS WHO

04:03:56.822 --> 04:04:00.025 region:rollup2
ACCEPT MEDICARE.

04:03:58.390 --> 04:04:01.327 region:rollup2
KNOWWHAT THAT IS AND THE

04:04:00.025 --> 04:04:03.062 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS GOING TO USE THAT

04:04:01.327 --> 04:04:04.463 region:rollup2
AS THE BASIS.

04:04:03.062 --> 04:04:05.564 region:rollup2
TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAKE

04:04:04.463 --> 04:04:07.967 region:rollup2
SENSE FOR THE STATE OF

04:04:05.564 --> 04:04:09.802 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE VARIOUS

04:04:07.967 --> 04:04:11.403 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT ARE BUILT INTO. THE

04:04:09.802 --> 04:04:13.305 region:rollup2
BELL I MEAN.

04:04:11.403 --> 04:04:15.307 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE

04:04:13.305 --> 04:04:16.475 region:rollup2
RATES ALLOW FOR STATE LAW

04:04:15.307 --> 04:04:18.944 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TIMELY

04:04:16.475 --> 04:04:20.613 region:rollup2
ACCESS LANGUAGE ACCESS AND

04:04:18.944 --> 04:04:22.014 region:rollup2
NETWORK ADULTS ADEQUACY.

04:04:20.613 --> 04:04:22.948 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALL EXISTING STATE

04:04:22.014 --> 04:04:24.083 region:rollup2
LAWS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO

04:04:22.948 --> 04:04:26.151 region:rollup2
DISAPPEAR THE BASE RATES HAVE TO

04:04:24.083 --> 04:04:27.953 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR THE.

04:04:26.151 --> 04:04:29.688 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT IN

04:04:27.953 --> 04:04:30.623 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FORTY PERCENT OF

04:04:29.688 --> 04:04:32.691 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ENROLLEES ARE IN

04:04:30.623 --> 04:04:33.993 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

04:04:32.691 --> 04:04:35.861 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT'S SO IMPORTANT

04:04:33.993 --> 04:04:37.530 region:rollup2
IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE

04:04:35.861 --> 04:04:39.398 region:rollup2
A VERY UNIQUE.

04:04:37.530 --> 04:04:40.766 region:rollup2
DELEGATED MODEL.

04:04:39.398 --> 04:04:43.402 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS LIKE

04:04:40.766 --> 04:04:43.969 region:rollup2
KAISER THAT HAVE DONE INCREDIBLE

04:04:43.402 --> 04:04:45.938 region:rollup2
WORK.

04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:47.907 region:rollup2
AND REALLY DO SOME VALUE BASED

04:04:45.938 --> 04:04:49.308 region:rollup2
CARE.

04:04:47.907 --> 04:04:51.243 region:rollup2
THE INTENT OF AB THIRTY EIGHTY

04:04:49.308 --> 04:04:52.745 region:rollup2
SEVEN IS NOT TO DISRUPT THAT

04:04:51.243 --> 04:04:54.346 region:rollup2
MODEL.

04:04:52.745 --> 04:04:56.715 region:rollup2
WE DID NOT WANT TO DISRUPT THE

04:04:54.346 --> 04:04:58.851 region:rollup2
WORK THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO

04:04:56.715 --> 04:05:01.520 region:rollup2
GET TO VALUE BASED CARE. AND SO

04:04:58.851 --> 04:05:03.589 region:rollup2
THE BILL VERY CLEARLY USES

04:05:01.520 --> 04:05:04.590 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

04:05:03.589 --> 04:05:06.559 region:rollup2
AND A PERCENTAGE OF MEDICARE

04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:08.127 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGE RISK ADJUSTED OF

04:05:06.559 --> 04:05:10.796 region:rollup2
COURSE FOR THE TO HER POPULATION

04:05:08.127 --> 04:05:13.432 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SET THE CAPITATED

04:05:10.796 --> 04:05:15.167 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS TO HEALTH PLANS.

04:05:13.432 --> 04:05:16.769 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH THE

04:05:15.167 --> 04:05:17.903 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS RELATIONSHIPS THAT

04:05:16.769 --> 04:05:19.538 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS HAVE WITH

04:05:17.903 --> 04:05:20.973 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED PROVIDERS

04:05:19.538 --> 04:05:22.274 region:rollup2
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US

04:05:20.973 --> 04:05:23.475 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LABOR

04:05:22.274 --> 04:05:24.076 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT HAVING SIXTY FIVE

04:05:23.475 --> 04:05:25.544 region:rollup2
PERCENT ENROLLMENT IN KAISER

04:05:24.076 --> 04:05:26.912 region:rollup2
PLANS.

04:05:25.544 --> 04:05:29.315 region:rollup2
BUT THAT WOULDN'T DISRUPT THIS

04:05:26.912 --> 04:05:31.183 region:rollup2
MODEL AND SO JUST TO ANSWER YOUR

04:05:29.315 --> 04:05:33.052 region:rollup2
QUESTION A LOT OF THE WORK IS

04:05:31.183 --> 04:05:34.787 region:rollup2
DONE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

04:05:33.052 --> 04:05:36.288 region:rollup2
AND THE COMMISSION WILL ADJUST

04:05:34.787 --> 04:05:39.658 region:rollup2
FOR THE REALITIES TO CALIFORNIA.

04:05:36.288 --> 04:05:42.394 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WHEN I HEAR THAT.

04:05:39.658 --> 04:05:43.996 region:rollup2
I'M I'M. ALMOST HEARING IS STILL

04:05:42.394 --> 04:05:45.764 region:rollup2
A ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

04:05:43.996 --> 04:05:48.167 region:rollup2
PLATFORM.

04:05:45.764 --> 04:05:50.536 region:rollup2
AND WHAT'S WRITTEN IN THE BILL.

04:05:48.167 --> 04:05:52.004 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS TO GIVE.

04:05:50.536 --> 04:05:53.739 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE IN UNDERSTANDING

04:05:52.004 --> 04:05:55.941 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME. OFF

04:05:53.739 --> 04:05:58.277 region:rollup2
RAMPS FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO

04:05:55.941 --> 04:06:00.145 region:rollup2
APPEAL THAT'S ALMOST OFF THE

04:05:58.277 --> 04:06:01.146 region:rollup2
TABLE BECAUSE WE'RE A GONNA BE

04:06:00.145 --> 04:06:02.781 region:rollup2
PREDETERMINED.

04:06:01.146 --> 04:06:04.383 region:rollup2
SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED MAYBE

04:06:02.781 --> 04:06:06.085 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION. SINCE YOU

04:06:04.383 --> 04:06:09.054 region:rollup2
COMMENTED A MAYBE YOU CAN MAYBE

04:06:06.085 --> 04:06:10.089 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THAT.

04:06:09.054 --> 04:06:10.756 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ME YES PLEASE THANK

04:06:10.089 --> 04:06:12.658 region:rollup2
YOU SOME WOMEN UP THE BILL DOES

04:06:10.756 --> 04:06:13.926 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATE SETTING DIFFERENT

04:06:12.658 --> 04:06:14.927 region:rollup2
RATES FOR DIFFERENT HOSPITALS

04:06:13.926 --> 04:06:16.328 region:rollup2
AND DIFFERENT PHYSICIAN GROUPS

04:06:14.927 --> 04:06:17.496 region:rollup2
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE BILL AT

04:06:16.328 --> 04:06:19.431 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION DOES HAVE THE

04:06:17.496 --> 04:06:21.100 region:rollup2
POWER TO SET. DIFFERENT RATES

04:06:19.431 --> 04:06:23.302 region:rollup2
FOR DISINFORMATION GROUPS IN THE

04:06:21.100 --> 04:06:24.436 region:rollup2
SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF THE FACT

04:06:23.302 --> 04:06:26.038 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE SAYING THAT MEDICARE

04:06:24.436 --> 04:06:27.706 region:rollup2
RT TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT FOR

04:06:26.038 --> 04:06:28.874 region:rollup2
ONE. OF THERE'S A LOT OF

04:06:27.706 --> 04:06:30.576 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS AND MEDICARE ESPECIALLY

04:06:28.874 --> 04:06:32.945 region:rollup2
AT NIGHT WHEN THEY WOULD ZONE

04:06:30.576 --> 04:06:34.213 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS URBAN OR

04:06:32.945 --> 04:06:35.948 region:rollup2
OR RURAL.

04:06:34.213 --> 04:06:37.349 region:rollup2
IT AS A MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

04:06:35.948 --> 04:06:38.384 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE

04:06:37.349 --> 04:06:40.185 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

04:06:38.384 --> 04:06:41.854 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THAT MEDICARE

YEAR.

04:08:16.281 --> 04:08:25.524 region:rollup2
AND SO. THAT'S. THE PPP.

04:08:20.619 --> 04:08:30.028 region:rollup2
.

04:08:25.524 --> 04:08:30.896 region:rollup2
SO ANNA.

04:08:30.028 --> 04:08:32.631 region:rollup2

POLICY COMIC JUST SAYS SIMPLY

04:08:35.601 --> 04:08:39.405 region:rollup2
PPP. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:08:37.569 --> 04:08:41.874 region:rollup2
STAFF REPORT UNDER PAGE TWENTY

04:08:39.405 --> 04:08:43.242 region:rollup2

THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND A

04:09:01.760 --> 04:09:04.997 region:rollup2
SON SENATE PROVIDE YEARS THE

04:09:03.095 --> 04:09:07.399 region:rollup2
REASON WHY IS THAT IS THOSE

04:09:04.997 --> 04:09:09.234 region:rollup2
EARLY YEARS THAT. WE. WOULD

04:09:07.399 --> 04:09:10.402 region:rollup2

ORGANIZATIONS.

04:09:11.570 --> 04:09:14.139 region:rollup2
IS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

GET THEIR PROPERTY BUT FOR SOME

04:09:14.139 --> 04:09:17.176 region:rollup2
THE THE.

04:09:14.773 --> 04:09:18.644 region:rollup2
THINK TANKS AND OTHERS THAT CAN

SUCH AS TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE ON

04:09:41.433 --> 04:09:46.438 region:rollup2
BEHALF OF CONSUMERS AND SO THE

04:09:44.069 --> 04:09:47.806 region:rollup2
INTENTION HERE IS TO REPLICATE

04:09:46.438 --> 04:09:49.908 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM THAT WE'VE

CAN SOMEONE UP THERE IS AND I

04:12:02.641 --> 04:12:05.911 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HAPPY TO AND JUST THAT

04:12:03.875 --> 04:12:07.446 region:rollup2
HISTORY HERE. RATE SETTING.

04:12:05.911 --> 04:12:09.114 region:rollup2
WAS EXPERIMENTED WITH STARTING

04:12:07.446 --> 04:12:11.483 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE

04:12:09.114 --> 04:12:13.151 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY FIVE STATES THAT HAD

04:12:11.483 --> 04:12:15.087 region:rollup2
RATE SETTING PROGRAMS.

04:12:13.151 --> 04:12:17.522 region:rollup2
WEST VIRGINIA WAS DIFFERENT

04:12:15.087 --> 04:12:19.524 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WEST VIRGINIA ORIGINALLY

04:12:17.522 --> 04:12:21.026 region:rollup2
ONLY HAD RATE SETTING FOR THE

04:12:19.524 --> 04:12:23.328 region:rollup2
PRIVATE INSURANCE SIDE THEY WERE

04:12:21.026 --> 04:12:24.863 region:rollup2
UNABLE. TO GET THE WAIVERS

04:12:23.328 --> 04:12:26.765 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO DO RATE SETTING ON

04:12:24.863 --> 04:12:27.966 region:rollup2
THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SIDE

04:12:26.765 --> 04:12:29.434 region:rollup2
OF THE EQUATION.

04:12:27.966 --> 04:12:31.069 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE OTHER STATES LET RATE

04:12:29.434 --> 04:12:32.738 region:rollup2
SETTING GO BY THE WAYSIDE AND

04:12:31.069 --> 04:12:33.872 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT WEST VIRGINIA.

04:12:32.738 --> 04:12:35.273 region:rollup2
HAS NOW BEEN BATTLING FOR THE

04:12:33.872 --> 04:12:37.609 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WAS

04:12:35.273 --> 04:12:38.844 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL IN UP REMOVING RATE

04:12:37.609 --> 04:12:40.012 region:rollup2
SETTING IS BECAUSE OF THOSE

04:12:38.844 --> 04:12:42.214 region:rollup2
OTHER TWO BARS.

04:12:40.012 --> 04:12:43.115 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE EXPERIENCING EXACTLY

04:12:42.214 --> 04:12:45.484 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE WE'RE TALKING

04:12:43.115 --> 04:12:46.018 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT IS WHEN THEY MOVED TO

04:12:45.484 --> 04:12:48.620 region:rollup2
RATE SETTING MEDICARE AND

04:12:46.018 --> 04:12:50.555 region:rollup2
MEDICAID. REIMBURSING IT COST

04:12:48.620 --> 04:12:51.089 region:rollup2
AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND

04:12:50.555 --> 04:12:53.792 region:rollup2
FEDERAL AND STATE BUDGET

04:12:51.089 --> 04:12:55.260 region:rollup2
PRESSURES ABOUT GREW. AS THOSE

04:12:53.792 --> 04:12:56.828 region:rollup2
RATES WENT BELOW COST THEY

04:12:55.260 --> 04:12:58.730 region:rollup2
COULDN'T JUST SET RATES FOR THE

04:12:56.828 --> 04:13:00.832 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR IT RESULTED IN

04:12:58.730 --> 04:13:02.401 region:rollup2
LOSSES. AND THAT'S WHEN THE

04:13:00.832 --> 04:13:04.169 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL COMMUNITY IN PARTICULAR

04:13:02.401 --> 04:13:05.170 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

04:13:04.169 --> 04:13:07.973 region:rollup2
MOUNTED AN EFFORT TO HAVE IT

04:13:05.170 --> 04:13:08.607 region:rollup2
REPEAL THE MORE SUCCESS.

04:13:07.973 --> 04:13:10.075 region:rollup2
SO AS WE SEE THIS STORY INTO A

04:13:08.607 --> 04:13:11.910 region:rollup2
FACT WE CAN START TO SEE HOW

04:13:10.075 --> 04:13:12.544 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED HERE.

04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:14.112 region:rollup2
IT IS COMING BACK TO A ONE SIZE

04:13:12.544 --> 04:13:15.681 region:rollup2
FITS.

04:13:14.112 --> 04:13:17.683 region:rollup2
ALL WITH LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR

04:13:15.681 --> 04:13:19.217 region:rollup2
INJECTION.

04:13:17.683 --> 04:13:20.752 region:rollup2
AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT MANY OF

04:13:19.217 --> 04:13:22.854 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE.

04:13:20.752 --> 04:13:24.256 region:rollup2
THAT ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE

04:13:22.854 --> 04:13:26.191 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO EVERYONE.

04:13:24.256 --> 04:13:27.793 region:rollup2
THAT DEBT THAT ARE IN NEED AND I

04:13:26.191 --> 04:13:29.861 region:rollup2
REPRESENT THAT RULE AREA THAT

04:13:27.793 --> 04:13:30.362 region:rollup2
YOU. SPEAK ABOUT AND I KNOW IT

04:13:29.861 --> 04:13:32.631 region:rollup2
VERY DEARLY WHEN MOST MY

04:13:30.362 --> 04:13:33.231 region:rollup2
DOCTORS.

04:13:32.631 --> 04:13:33.965 region:rollup2
OR A CLOTHES SHOP BECAUSE THEY

04:13:33.231 --> 04:13:35.033 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

04:13:33.965 --> 04:13:37.235 region:rollup2
STAND BUSINESS IT'S BEEN VERY

04:13:35.033 --> 04:13:39.171 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING.

04:13:37.235 --> 04:13:40.672 region:rollup2
BUT. I FIND IT JUST PERPLEXING

04:13:39.171 --> 04:13:42.741 region:rollup2
HERE THAT THERE'S SO MANY OPEN

04:13:40.672 --> 04:13:43.842 region:rollup2
ENDED QUESTIONS.

04:13:42.741 --> 04:13:45.811 region:rollup2
THAT WERE TRYING TO PUSH A BILL

04:13:43.842 --> 04:13:46.912 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

04:13:45.811 --> 04:13:48.246 region:rollup2
WHEN IS STILL NEEDS MORE TIME TO

04:13:46.912 --> 04:13:49.147 region:rollup2
BE.

04:13:48.246 --> 04:13:51.116 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED.

04:13:49.147 --> 04:13:52.217 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I STILL

04:13:51.116 --> 04:13:54.186 region:rollup2
THINK THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO

04:13:52.217 --> 04:13:57.055 region:rollup2
THIS. IS WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF

04:13:54.186 --> 04:13:58.890 region:rollup2
THE. SOME OF THESE PLANS.

04:13:57.055 --> 04:13:59.524 region:rollup2
ARE FROM OUT OF STATE AND BY

04:13:58.890 --> 04:14:00.559 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES ARE NOT GOING TO BE

04:13:59.524 --> 04:14:01.960 region:rollup2
MANDATED.

04:14:00.559 --> 04:14:03.528 region:rollup2
UNDER THE SAME TERMS AND

04:14:01.960 --> 04:14:05.497 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AS THE ONES WITHIN

04:14:03.528 --> 04:14:10.936 region:rollup2
THE STATE HOW COULD YOU ADDRESS

04:14:05.497 --> 04:14:11.737 region:rollup2
THAT FOREST TODAY.

04:14:10.936 --> 04:14:14.573 region:rollup2
MISTER BIGELOW IS YOUR QUESTION

04:14:11.737 --> 04:14:16.341 region:rollup2
AROUND HEALTH PLANS THAT ARE OUT

04:14:14.573 --> 04:14:19.678 region:rollup2
OF STATE HEALTH PLANS YEAH. THE

04:14:16.341 --> 04:14:21.880 region:rollup2
REASON THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON.

04:14:19.678 --> 04:14:22.781 region:rollup2
REGULATING DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND

04:14:21.880 --> 04:14:25.951 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLANS.

04:14:22.781 --> 04:14:25.951 region:rollup2
AND HAVE.

04:14:26.017 --> 04:14:28.887 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS DIRECTED TO LOOK

04:14:27.385 --> 04:14:30.655 region:rollup2
AT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS BECAUSE

04:14:28.887 --> 04:14:33.391 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE

04:14:30.655 --> 04:14:35.093 region:rollup2
CAN REGULATE HEALTH PLANS

04:14:33.391 --> 04:14:37.262 region:rollup2
DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS.

04:14:35.093 --> 04:14:38.396 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT. PRESCRIPTIONDRUGS

04:14:37.262 --> 04:14:39.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S FEDERAL

04:14:38.396 --> 04:14:41.233 region:rollup2
PREEMPTION AND THERE'S THE

04:14:39.798 --> 04:14:42.801 region:rollup2
COMMERCE CLAUSE AND LOTS OF.

04:14:41.233 --> 04:14:44.703 region:rollup2
LEGAL ISSUES.

04:14:42.801 --> 04:14:46.938 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON

04:14:44.703 --> 04:14:48.006 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE OUT BUT.

04:14:46.938 --> 04:14:49.541 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS THE POWER TO

04:14:48.006 --> 04:14:51.209 region:rollup2
REGULATE HEALTH PLANS AND SO

04:14:49.541 --> 04:14:52.277 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO.

04:14:51.209 --> 04:14:53.612 region:rollup2
DO IF THEY ARE SELLING IN

04:14:52.277 --> 04:14:54.146 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAN THEY ARE

04:14:53.612 --> 04:14:55.547 region:rollup2
REGULATED BY THE STATE OF

04:14:54.146 --> 04:14:59.985 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

04:14:55.547 --> 04:15:02.587 region:rollup2
CAN.

04:14:59.985 --> 04:15:04.723 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN'T WE DON'T HAVE TO

04:15:02.587 --> 04:15:06.491 region:rollup2
WORRY ABOUT OUR STATE ENTITIES

04:15:04.723 --> 04:15:07.526 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CERTAIN

04:15:06.491 --> 04:15:10.228 region:rollup2
THINGS IN THE STATE OF

04:15:07.526 --> 04:15:11.329 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND NOT BE REGULATED.

04:15:10.228 --> 04:15:16.768 region:rollup2
AND GET A DIFFERENT VALUE. ON

04:15:11.329 --> 04:15:19.271 region:rollup2
RETURN.

04:15:16.768 --> 04:15:21.640 region:rollup2
NO THE PLANTS THAT ARE PROVIDE

04:15:19.271 --> 04:15:22.974 region:rollup2
AIR IN CALIFORNIA ARE REGULATED

04:15:21.640 --> 04:15:23.909 region:rollup2
EVERITT THERE HAVE CALIFORNIA

04:15:22.974 --> 04:15:25.010 region:rollup2
ENROLLEES ARE REGULATED BY THE

STATE WHEN ASKING A DIFFERENT

HEALTH PLANS REGULATE IN THE

04:15:36.922 --> 04:15:39.357 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SUBJECT

SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS SO WE'RE

04:15:55.740 --> 04:15:57.943 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA HAVE A CONFLICT

04:15:56.274 --> 04:15:59.778 region:rollup2
BETWEEN FEDERAL. LAWS AND

04:15:57.943 --> 04:16:01.580 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S.

04:15:59.778 --> 04:16:02.647 region:rollup2
MAYBE YOU GUYS CAN MAYBE IT GOT

ANY.

04:16:06.685 --> 04:16:11.056 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE DON'T GET IT TO COME.

04:16:08.820 --> 04:16:13.425 region:rollup2
YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF

04:16:11.056 --> 04:16:15.527 region:rollup2
AND EMPLOYERS HAVE ARE SELF

LABOR MANAGEMENT TRUST FUNDS.

04:16:16.962 --> 04:16:19.598 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO

AS A RISK APPLY ANSWER TAPPED

04:16:19.598 --> 04:16:24.436 region:rollup2

04:16:22.234 --> 04:16:26.171 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE REGULATED BY THE

04:16:24.436 --> 04:16:27.672 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR UNDER

04:16:26.171 --> 04:16:30.775 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED THE RISA.

04:16:27.672 --> 04:16:32.744 region:rollup2
AND ARISTA PLANS ARE NOT

04:16:30.775 --> 04:16:33.778 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY THE

.

04:16:35.213 --> 04:16:40.485 region:rollup2
THE BUT THE WAY THAT THIS BILL

04:16:37.382 --> 04:16:43.855 region:rollup2
IS CRAFTED IS THAT RISA PLANS

04:16:40.485 --> 04:16:45.390 region:rollup2
CAN OPT IN TO HAVING THE RATES

04:16:43.855 --> 04:16:47.325 region:rollup2
THAT ARE AT THE BASE AMOUNTS

04:16:45.390 --> 04:16:49.094 region:rollup2
THAT ARE SET BY THE COMMISSION.

04:16:47.325 --> 04:16:52.197 region:rollup2
BUT IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY

04:16:49.094 --> 04:16:53.932 region:rollup2
IMPOSE UPON OR REGULATE SELF

04:16:52.197 --> 04:16:55.333 region:rollup2
INSURED AGGRESSIVE PLANS BECAUSE

04:16:53.932 --> 04:16:57.269 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE PREEMPTED BY THE

04:16:55.333 --> 04:16:58.536 region:rollup2

04:17:44.049 --> 04:17:46.518 region:rollup2
A LOT MORE BILLS AT TODAY TO AND

04:17:45.617 --> 04:17:47.585 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALMOST TWO HOURS AND OUR

04:17:46.518 --> 04:17:49.321 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION I DO NOT WANT TO

04:17:47.585 --> 04:17:50.255 region:rollup2
LIMIT THE DISCUSSION I THINK

04:17:49.321 --> 04:17:52.190 region:rollup2
THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS

04:17:50.255 --> 04:17:54.526 region:rollup2
BUT. QUESTIONS BEEN ANSWERED

04:17:52.190 --> 04:17:56.461 region:rollup2
PLEASE DON'T ASK IT AGAIN.

04:17:54.526 --> 04:17:58.430 region:rollup2
SO THE NEXT PERSON TO ASK GO

04:17:56.461 --> 04:18:00.332 region:rollup2
WILL BE MISSED BURKE AND ON DECK

04:17:58.430 --> 04:18:00.932 region:rollup2
IS MISTER BONTA WON'T.

04:18:00.332 --> 04:18:02.600 region:rollup2
PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN

04:18:00.932 --> 04:18:04.102 region:rollup2
THE QUEUE SO.

04:18:02.600 --> 04:18:05.403 region:rollup2
SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THERE

04:18:04.102 --> 04:18:06.805 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME QUESTIONS I

04:18:05.403 --> 04:18:07.939 region:rollup2
ASKED THE SPONSORS WHEN THEY

04:18:06.805 --> 04:18:08.673 region:rollup2
CAME TO MY OFFICE AND THEN I

04:18:07.939 --> 04:18:10.675 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS FOR

04:18:08.673 --> 04:18:12.644 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION I'M MAKING QUESTION

04:18:10.675 --> 04:18:13.211 region:rollup2
STILL CONTINUES TO BE WHAT IS

04:18:12.644 --> 04:18:14.245 region:rollup2
YOUR PROJECTED SAVINGS WITH

04:18:13.211 --> 04:18:17.549 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:18:14.245 --> 04:18:19.551 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND THEN OR WITH THIS.

04:18:17.549 --> 04:18:20.185 region:rollup2
GROUP AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION

04:18:19.551 --> 04:18:22.220 region:rollup2
WHICH IS STILL PRAYER THE SAME

04:18:20.185 --> 04:18:23.888 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS EITHER I DO HAVE

04:18:22.220 --> 04:18:25.857 region:rollup2
SOME CONCERN NOT TOO DIFFERENT

04:18:23.888 --> 04:18:27.759 region:rollup2
FROM MR BIGELOW IS THAT THERE'S

04:18:25.857 --> 04:18:28.326 region:rollup2
THIS I'M GETTING THE SENSE AND

04:18:27.759 --> 04:18:29.427 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MISTER CHAIRMAN AS

04:18:28.326 --> 04:18:30.695 region:rollup2
WELL.

04:18:29.427 --> 04:18:31.363 region:rollup2
IS I'M GETTING THE SENSE THAT

04:18:30.695 --> 04:18:33.765 region:rollup2
THERE HASN'T BEEN A REAL

04:18:31.363 --> 04:18:35.567 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND AND WHAT

04:18:33.765 --> 04:18:37.569 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ME NOW IS THAT.

04:18:35.567 --> 04:18:38.737 region:rollup2
DO YOU HAVE ANY MODELING ON WHAT

04:18:37.569 --> 04:18:41.139 region:rollup2
THE EFFECT THIS WILL HAVE ON

04:18:38.737 --> 04:18:43.675 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS CAN YOU SHOW US. THE

04:18:41.139 --> 04:18:45.410 region:rollup2
ACTUAL BALANCE SHEET OR HOW YOU

04:18:43.675 --> 04:18:46.878 region:rollup2
PROJECT THIS WILL WORK WITH THE

04:18:45.410 --> 04:18:48.446 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS OF

04:18:46.878 --> 04:18:50.148 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN

04:18:48.446 --> 04:18:52.050 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

04:18:50.148 --> 04:18:53.785 region:rollup2
THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS YOU SAY

04:18:52.050 --> 04:18:56.121 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW MORE

04:18:53.785 --> 04:18:58.189 region:rollup2
ACCESS FOR URBAN AND RURAL

04:18:56.121 --> 04:18:58.757 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HOWEVER YET I SEE

04:18:58.189 --> 04:18:59.758 region:rollup2
NONE OF THEM HERE SUPPORTING

04:18:58.757 --> 04:19:01.926 region:rollup2
YOU.

04:18:59.758 --> 04:19:04.396 region:rollup2
AND THAT GIVES ME GREAT PAUSE.

04:19:01.926 --> 04:19:05.230 region:rollup2
SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS.

04:19:04.396 --> 04:19:09.467 region:rollup2
FOR THE SUPPORTERS AND THEN I AM

04:19:05.230 --> 04:19:11.669 region:rollup2
A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE.

04:19:09.467 --> 04:19:12.704 region:rollup2
SO ON THE OVERALL PROJECTED

04:19:11.669 --> 04:19:15.407 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

04:19:12.704 --> 04:19:17.876 region:rollup2
AND MODELING QUESTION.

04:19:15.407 --> 04:19:21.379 region:rollup2
WE WERE PURPOSEFUL IN NOT

04:19:17.876 --> 04:19:24.215 region:rollup2
SETTING THIS AS A CAP BILL.

04:19:21.379 --> 04:19:26.384 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A A SPECIFIC

04:19:24.215 --> 04:19:28.353 region:rollup2
TARGETED MEDICARE RATE THAT WE

04:19:26.384 --> 04:19:30.288 region:rollup2
SET MAY RATES THAT THAT WOULD

04:19:28.353 --> 04:19:32.991 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ONE APPROACH THERE IS

04:19:30.288 --> 04:19:35.126 region:rollup2
NOT ONE OVERALL SORT OF.

04:19:32.991 --> 04:19:36.861 region:rollup2
SAVINGS NUMBER THAT WE'RE AIMING

04:19:35.126 --> 04:19:39.364 region:rollup2
FOR HERE BECAUSE WE DON'T

04:19:36.861 --> 04:19:41.733 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT IT IS PRUDENT.

04:19:39.364 --> 04:19:44.002 region:rollup2
TO CUT FOR THE SAKE OF CUTTING

04:19:41.733 --> 04:19:46.371 region:rollup2
THERE IS A REASON THAT THIS IS

04:19:44.002 --> 04:19:48.406 region:rollup2
ABOUT BOTH IMPROVING ACCESS AND

04:19:46.371 --> 04:19:51.476 region:rollup2
QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE WHILE

04:19:48.406 --> 04:19:53.645 region:rollup2
ALSO CONSTRAINING UNREASONABLE.

04:19:51.476 --> 04:19:55.079 region:rollup2
PRICE INCREASES THEY'RE NOT

04:19:53.645 --> 04:19:56.247 region:rollup2
TIED TO OUTCOMES THAT ARE NOT

04:19:55.079 --> 04:19:58.316 region:rollup2
TIED TO QUALITY THAT ARE TIED TO

04:19:56.247 --> 04:19:59.984 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION.

04:19:58.316 --> 04:20:01.986 region:rollup2
WE DON'T PRESUME TO KNOW WHAT

04:19:59.984 --> 04:20:03.521 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN A COMPLEX HEALTHCARE

04:20:01.986 --> 04:20:06.691 region:rollup2
MARKET

04:20:03.521 --> 04:20:07.892 region:rollup2
RATHER THE BILL IS VERY MARYLAND

04:20:06.691 --> 04:20:10.195 region:rollup2
INSPIRED.

04:20:07.892 --> 04:20:11.663 region:rollup2
BUT THE BILL SORT OF REVISITS

04:20:10.195 --> 04:20:13.631 region:rollup2
MARILYN'S EXPERIENCE THEY

04:20:11.663 --> 04:20:14.599 region:rollup2
STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE

04:20:13.631 --> 04:20:16.334 region:rollup2
WHEN THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT

04:20:14.599 --> 04:20:18.703 region:rollup2
WAS QUITE DIFFERENT.

04:20:16.334 --> 04:20:21.539 region:rollup2
AND WE ASK OURSELVES WHAT WOULD

04:20:18.703 --> 04:20:24.209 region:rollup2
MARILYN DO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

04:20:21.539 --> 04:20:25.944 region:rollup2
HAVE A SENSE OF THAT THEY ARE

04:20:24.209 --> 04:20:29.047 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO PULL WITHIN THEIR

04:20:25.944 --> 04:20:30.281 region:rollup2
COMMISSION. PHYSICIAN COSTS

04:20:29.047 --> 04:20:32.684 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS TO THE

04:20:30.281 --> 04:20:35.687 region:rollup2
EXTENT ALLOWED BY FEDERAL LAW.

04:20:32.684 --> 04:20:37.055 region:rollup2
AND OUTPATIENT COSTS AND

04:20:35.687 --> 04:20:38.790 region:rollup2
SERVICES INCLUDING OF A GLOBAL

04:20:37.055 --> 04:20:41.126 region:rollup2
CAP.

04:20:38.790 --> 04:20:42.894 region:rollup2
IN MARILYN'S EXPERIENCE THE DID

04:20:41.126 --> 04:20:44.262 region:rollup2
NOT START WITH ALL PEERS

04:20:42.894 --> 04:20:46.197 region:rollup2
THE LAW WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN

04:20:44.262 --> 04:20:48.099 region:rollup2
SEVENTY ONE. AND IT TOOK UNTIL

04:20:46.197 --> 04:20:50.735 region:rollup2
NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN FOR THEM

04:20:48.099 --> 04:20:52.437 region:rollup2
TO GET THE NECESSARY WAIVERS TO

04:20:50.735 --> 04:20:53.438 region:rollup2
PULL IN THE PUBLIC PROGRAMS BUT

04:20:52.437 --> 04:20:54.806 region:rollup2
IT PRECEDED ANYWAY WITH SETTING

04:20:53.438 --> 04:20:58.276 region:rollup2
RATES.

04:20:54.806 --> 04:20:59.644 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST

04:20:58.276 --> 04:21:01.079 region:rollup2
DRIVERS AND HEALTH CARE ARE A

04:20:59.644 --> 04:21:03.248 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF MUCH MORE THAN

04:21:01.079 --> 04:21:04.983 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL COSTS IN A VACUUM.

04:21:03.248 --> 04:21:06.851 region:rollup2
YOU DO HAVE TO FACTOR IN OTHER

04:21:04.983 --> 04:21:09.354 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS

04:21:06.851 --> 04:21:11.389 region:rollup2
SO THE PART OF THE REASON WHY WE

04:21:09.354 --> 04:21:13.091 region:rollup2
DID THE THE REVIEW OF LITERATURE

04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:14.626 region:rollup2
IN THE OUTCOMES IN THE SUCCESSES

04:21:13.091 --> 04:21:16.895 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WORKED AND WHAT DIDN'T.

04:21:14.626 --> 04:21:19.230 region:rollup2
OVER THE COURSE OF FORTY YEARS

04:21:16.895 --> 04:21:21.399 region:rollup2
AGO. YOU KNOW EXPERIMENT WITH.

04:21:19.230 --> 04:21:22.734 region:rollup2
REGULATING THE INDUSTRY THE

04:21:21.399 --> 04:21:24.802 region:rollup2
REGULATION WORKED

04:21:22.734 --> 04:21:26.671 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AND IN MARYLAND IT

04:21:24.802 --> 04:21:29.040 region:rollup2
WORKED PARTICULARLY WELL DUE TO

04:21:26.671 --> 04:21:30.909 region:rollup2
THE FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE IT WAS

04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:32.710 region:rollup2
NOT OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE.

04:21:30.909 --> 04:21:36.214 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT ALLOWED FOR THE

04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:37.949 region:rollup2
COMMISSION TO SHIFT OVER TIME.

04:21:36.214 --> 04:21:39.751 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT WAS

04:21:37.949 --> 04:21:41.085 region:rollup2
FOCUSED SOLELY ON HOSPITALS AND

04:21:39.751 --> 04:21:42.520 region:rollup2
NOT ON THE BROADER HEALTH CARE

04:21:41.085 --> 04:21:44.088 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHICH THEY ARE NOW TRYING

04:21:42.520 --> 04:21:46.991 region:rollup2
TO FIX.

04:21:44.088 --> 04:21:47.592 region:rollup2
AND SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S

04:21:46.991 --> 04:21:49.160 region:rollup2
HARD TO GIVE YOU AN ANSWER

04:21:47.592 --> 04:21:50.495 region:rollup2
BECAUSE PART OF WHAT WE'RE

04:21:49.160 --> 04:21:52.096 region:rollup2
TRYING TO ACHIEVE HERE IS

04:21:50.495 --> 04:21:53.831 region:rollup2
PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF ONE

04:21:52.096 --> 04:21:55.500 region:rollup2
SIZE FITS ALL. WE COULD HAVE

04:21:53.831 --> 04:21:58.136 region:rollup2
GONE THAT ROUTE WE DIDN'T WE'RE

04:21:55.500 --> 04:22:00.138 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT

04:21:58.136 --> 04:22:02.207 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THIS REALLY IS

04:22:00.138 --> 04:22:04.409 region:rollup2
ABOUT ENSURING ACCESS. AND

04:22:02.207 --> 04:22:05.977 region:rollup2
CORRECTING FOR MARKET FAILURES

04:22:04.409 --> 04:22:08.479 region:rollup2
IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHICH

04:22:05.977 --> 04:22:10.882 region:rollup2
ARE EVIDENT IN. UNNECESSARY

04:22:08.479 --> 04:22:13.384 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL CLOSURES BECAUSE A

04:22:10.882 --> 04:22:14.986 region:rollup2
PROVIDER CAN'T COMPETE BECAUSE

04:22:13.384 --> 04:22:16.421 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN A REGION THAT IS TOO

04:22:14.986 --> 04:22:18.156 region:rollup2
POOR.

04:22:16.421 --> 04:22:21.492 region:rollup2
TO ATTRACT PHYSICIANS AND

04:22:18.156 --> 04:22:22.427 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PAYMENTS TO IT.

04:22:21.492 --> 04:22:24.362 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T KNOW THAT ANSWER THE

04:22:22.427 --> 04:22:26.898 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

04:22:24.362 --> 04:22:28.299 region:rollup2
HONESTLY I THINK.

04:22:26.898 --> 04:22:29.500 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A HUGE HIT WITH THE

04:22:28.299 --> 04:22:30.501 region:rollup2
RECORD OF WHAT YOU ARE ASKING

04:22:29.500 --> 04:22:32.904 region:rollup2
FOR IS IS.

04:22:30.501 --> 04:22:34.906 region:rollup2
MONUMENTAL.

04:22:32.904 --> 04:22:36.541 region:rollup2
AND TO NOT HAVE HAD A PROCESS I

04:22:34.906 --> 04:22:37.742 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK YOU DO RESPONDED TO

04:22:36.541 --> 04:22:39.344 region:rollup2
THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EITHER

04:22:37.742 --> 04:22:40.645 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A PROCESS IN WHICH YOU

04:22:39.344 --> 04:22:41.746 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT INCLUDED STAKEHOLDERS

04:22:40.645 --> 04:22:43.815 region:rollup2
OF WHICH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

04:22:41.746 --> 04:22:45.783 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED HOSPITALS. AND WORK

04:22:43.815 --> 04:22:47.385 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO GET TO WHAT ARE THE

04:22:45.783 --> 04:22:48.987 region:rollup2
REALISTIC THERE ARE I MEAN A

04:22:47.385 --> 04:22:50.888 region:rollup2
BALANCE SHEET IS NOT CONJECTURED

04:22:48.987 --> 04:22:52.323 region:rollup2
THAT IS NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE TO

04:22:50.888 --> 04:22:53.491 region:rollup2
ADD TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

04:22:52.323 --> 04:22:55.159 region:rollup2
NOT THE RIGHT. TO MAKE SURE

04:22:53.491 --> 04:22:56.461 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MEMBERS ARE PAID WHAT

04:22:55.159 --> 04:22:57.629 region:rollup2
THEY DESERVE TO BE PAID WHICH I

04:22:56.461 --> 04:23:00.265 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT.

04:22:57.629 --> 04:23:01.866 region:rollup2
SO IT GIVES ME GREAT PAUSE THAT

04:23:00.265 --> 04:23:03.301 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS HAS NOT HAPPENED

04:23:01.866 --> 04:23:04.869 region:rollup2
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROCESS WAS

04:23:03.301 --> 04:23:06.371 region:rollup2
AND I DO AT NO ONE LIKES DOING

04:23:04.869 --> 04:23:08.139 region:rollup2
IT IT'S HARD WORK IT TAKES A LOT

04:23:06.371 --> 04:23:09.674 region:rollup2
OF TIME. AND YES IT DOES NOT

04:23:08.139 --> 04:23:11.409 region:rollup2
FALL ALWAYS IN OUR DEADLINES TO

04:23:09.674 --> 04:23:13.278 region:rollup2
DO THINGS IN THIS YEAR BUT WITH

04:23:11.409 --> 04:23:15.013 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THIS BIG IT SHOULD BE

04:23:13.278 --> 04:23:16.314 region:rollup2
WRITTEN IRRESPONSIBILITY.

04:23:15.013 --> 04:23:18.983 region:rollup2
SO THAT IS NOT ONE THAT'S THE

04:23:16.314 --> 04:23:20.151 region:rollup2
FIRST THING I AT GALLAGHER HAD.

04:23:18.983 --> 04:23:22.654 region:rollup2
IF I COULD JUST RESPOND TO THAT

04:23:20.151 --> 04:23:24.389 region:rollup2
THE TWO QUESTIONS WHAT ONE IS ON

04:23:22.654 --> 04:23:25.523 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT TO SAY WELL.

04:23:24.389 --> 04:23:26.591 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE

04:23:25.523 --> 04:23:28.459 region:rollup2
THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY SETTING

04:23:26.591 --> 04:23:29.727 region:rollup2
RATES RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW I CAN

04:23:28.459 --> 04:23:31.696 region:rollup2
TELL YOU WE'RE GONNA SAVE X.

04:23:29.727 --> 04:23:32.664 region:rollup2
BILLIONS X. MILLIONS. AND AND

04:23:31.696 --> 04:23:33.898 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA GIVE THIS MUCH

04:23:32.664 --> 04:23:36.200 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

04:23:33.898 --> 04:23:38.069 region:rollup2
THAT IS UP.

04:23:36.200 --> 04:23:39.671 region:rollup2
A FALSEHOOD COULD CHART BUT

04:23:38.069 --> 04:23:41.272 region:rollup2
THERE CHOOSING A NUMBER ENDING

04:23:39.671 --> 04:23:43.574 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

04:23:41.272 --> 04:23:44.542 region:rollup2
IF WE DID THAT ARM THE BILL TO

04:23:43.574 --> 04:23:45.543 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU THOSE ARE THOSE NUMBERS

04:23:44.542 --> 04:23:46.878 region:rollup2
TO BE OUT AS WE DON'T WANT TO DO

04:23:45.543 --> 04:23:48.012 region:rollup2
THAT WE THAT'S IDEA OF GETTING

04:23:46.878 --> 04:23:49.580 region:rollup2
EXPERTS.

04:23:48.012 --> 04:23:51.115 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY SET THE RATES SET

04:23:49.580 --> 04:23:52.383 region:rollup2
THE BASEMENTS OF THE JUST AMAZED

04:23:51.115 --> 04:23:54.352 region:rollup2
ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY

04:23:52.383 --> 04:23:55.987 region:rollup2
AT THE END OF THE DAY MAY BE

04:23:54.352 --> 04:23:57.155 region:rollup2
COSTLY FLAT WHERE THEY ARE. AND

04:23:55.987 --> 04:23:58.556 region:rollup2
THEY WON'T GO UP TEN PERCENT A

04:23:57.155 --> 04:23:59.157 region:rollup2
YEAR THE MIKE WHAT THREE PERCENT

04:23:58.556 --> 04:24:00.758 region:rollup2
A YEAR WHICH YOU'RE SUGGESTING

04:23:59.157 --> 04:24:02.193 region:rollup2
IT'S COSTING TOO.

04:24:00.758 --> 04:24:03.327 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SELLING IT AS COST

04:24:02.193 --> 04:24:05.530 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT AND THAT IS COST

04:24:03.327 --> 04:24:07.098 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT SO MIKE MINE CURIOUS

04:24:05.530 --> 04:24:08.800 region:rollup2
I GUESS FURTHER AGAIN IS NOT THE

04:24:07.098 --> 04:24:10.435 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IF IN FACT THIS IS

04:24:08.800 --> 04:24:12.537 region:rollup2
COST CONTAINMENT IN THAN FACT

04:24:10.435 --> 04:24:14.539 region:rollup2
THIS WILL GIVE. MORE ACCESS TO

04:24:12.537 --> 04:24:15.873 region:rollup2
URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES HAVE

04:24:14.539 --> 04:24:17.475 region:rollup2
YOU I MEAN THERE SHOULD BE ONE

04:24:15.873 --> 04:24:18.509 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL THERE SHOULD BE ONE

04:24:17.475 --> 04:24:20.078 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO GO

04:24:18.509 --> 04:24:21.612 region:rollup2
THROUGH WITH YOU AND AND AND SEE

04:24:20.078 --> 04:24:22.947 region:rollup2
WHAT THIS ACTUAL PROCESS WOULD

04:24:21.612 --> 04:24:24.382 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE WITH YOUR EXPERTS.

04:24:22.947 --> 04:24:25.383 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE MOVE THIS BILL INTO

04:24:24.382 --> 04:24:26.784 region:rollup2
ACTION

04:24:25.383 --> 04:24:28.553 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD

04:24:26.784 --> 04:24:31.255 region:rollup2
WHY WE WOULD DO THIS WITHOUT ANY

04:24:28.553 --> 04:24:33.191 region:rollup2
DATA OR ANY ACTUAL ACTUAL

04:24:31.255 --> 04:24:34.125 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AT THIS IS THAT THIS IS

04:24:33.191 --> 04:24:35.993 region:rollup2
NOT SOMETHING THAT IS.

04:24:34.125 --> 04:24:37.261 region:rollup2
.

04:24:35.993 --> 04:24:39.363 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S TO

04:24:37.261 --> 04:24:40.531 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. AND WHEN A

04:24:39.363 --> 04:24:42.100 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL IT'S GOING TO GOING TO

04:24:40.531 --> 04:24:43.167 region:rollup2
THE RED BOOK FOR A FIRST OF ALL

04:24:42.100 --> 04:24:44.369 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NUMBER HAAS WAS IN THE

04:24:43.167 --> 04:24:45.636 region:rollup2
BED THEIR NUMBER OF HOSTELS THAT

04:24:44.369 --> 04:24:48.306 region:rollup2
ARE CLOSE INCLUDING MY OWN

04:24:45.636 --> 04:24:49.507 region:rollup2
BACKYARD. ENDS AND SO THAT'S

04:24:48.306 --> 04:24:51.275 region:rollup2
ALREADY HAPPENING BUT I WILL SAY

04:24:49.507 --> 04:24:52.009 region:rollup2
THIS CLUB IS THE TOLL OF THE

04:24:51.275 --> 04:24:54.045 region:rollup2
JIMMY CONCERN.

04:24:52.009 --> 04:24:55.947 region:rollup2
ONE IS A REASON WHY WE PUT INTO

04:24:54.045 --> 04:24:57.048 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT OF THE BILL AND THEN

04:24:55.947 --> 04:24:58.583 region:rollup2
I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR WHO

04:24:57.048 --> 04:25:00.151 region:rollup2

04:24:58.583 --> 04:25:01.586 region:rollup2
STRINGENT DATA COLLECTION.

04:25:00.151 --> 04:25:02.954 region:rollup2
AND THAT DATA CLUTCH IS GOING TO

04:25:01.586 --> 04:25:04.222 region:rollup2
HAPPEN WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS IS

04:25:02.954 --> 04:25:05.923 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAPPEN BEFORE WE SET

04:25:04.222 --> 04:25:07.391 region:rollup2
RATES FOR PHYSICIANS.

04:25:05.923 --> 04:25:09.427 region:rollup2
SECONDLY THERE'S A ROBUST

04:25:07.391 --> 04:25:11.195 region:rollup2

WE WERE GETTING CHAMBER OF

04:25:19.504 --> 04:25:22.673 region:rollup2
COMMERCE OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH.

TO BE GOOD FOR ALMOST EVERY

EMPLOYER IN OUR STATE BUT WE

KNOW THAT HOSPITAL'S A LARGE

04:25:26.911 --> 04:25:29.781 region:rollup2
CHRISTIAN GROUPS ARE MEMBERS OF

04:25:28.579 --> 04:25:31.215 region:rollup2
THOSE CHAMBERS. UNLESS WE HAVE

04:25:29.781 --> 04:25:32.083 region:rollup2

COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHICH. DID

04:25:59.977 --> 04:26:03.347 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY COST CONTAINMENT.

04:26:01.579 --> 04:26:05.550 region:rollup2
AS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF WHAT

04:26:03.347 --> 04:26:06.784 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO DO THIS IS COST

04:26:05.550 --> 04:26:08.119 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT NOT COST CUTTING.

04:26:06.784 --> 04:26:09.887 region:rollup2
IT'S COST CONTAINMENT SO THAT WE

04:26:08.119 --> 04:26:11.389 region:rollup2
CAN CONTROL THE RATE OF GROWTH

04:26:09.887 --> 04:26:13.591 region:rollup2
IN THE OUT YEARS SO THAT WE CAN

04:26:11.389 --> 04:26:15.593 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME SORT EXPECTATIONS BUT

04:26:13.591 --> 04:26:16.794 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO COST CONTAINMENT. OR

04:26:15.593 --> 04:26:18.629 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WILL GO ON PLACE

04:26:16.794 --> 04:26:19.597 region:rollup2
UNTIL ALL THE DATA IS THERE WITH

04:26:18.629 --> 04:26:20.164 region:rollup2
ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE

INTO PLAY.

04:26:39.750 --> 04:26:42.620 region:rollup2
THE I MEAN ISN'T THAT SORT OF

04:26:40.918 --> 04:26:43.955 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IS

04:26:42.620 --> 04:26:45.189 region:rollup2
TO COLLECT THE DATA FIRST AND

04:26:43.955 --> 04:26:46.190 region:rollup2
THEN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

COMMISSION AND NO WITHOUT

04:26:46.190 --> 04:26:47.892 region:rollup2

HEALTH CARE THE UNSUSTAINABLE

04:29:49.740 --> 04:29:51.475 region:rollup2
RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE WE'VE

04:29:50.374 --> 04:29:53.077 region:rollup2
HAD.

04:29:51.475 --> 04:29:54.678 region:rollup2
JOINT COMMITTEE HEARINGS ON IT

04:29:53.077 --> 04:29:56.480 region:rollup2
IT COMES UP AND ANIMATES ALMOST

04:29:54.678 --> 04:29:58.649 region:rollup2
EVERY DISCUSSION IN HEALTH CARE

04:29:56.480 --> 04:30:00.551 region:rollup2

WILLINGNESS TO TAKE THIS ISSUE.

04:30:01.952 --> 04:30:05.056 region:rollup2
HEAD ON I THINK PROBABLY IN THIS

04:30:03.387 --> 04:30:05.856 region:rollup2
ROOM THERE IS WIDE AGREEMENT ON

04:30:05.056 --> 04:30:06.991 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS I DON'T

04:30:05.856 --> 04:30:08.592 region:rollup2
THINK ANYONE WILL DENY THAT

04:30:06.991 --> 04:30:10.261 region:rollup2
RISING COSTS ARE PROBLEM.

04:30:08.592 --> 04:30:11.228 region:rollup2
I THINK FOR SURE THERE'S WIDE

04:30:10.261 --> 04:30:12.763 region:rollup2
DISAGREEMENT AND I WHAT THE

04:30:11.228 --> 04:30:14.565 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE SOLUTION AS I AM I

04:30:12.763 --> 04:30:15.900 region:rollup2
WILL SAY THAT. IF THIS WERE A

04:30:14.565 --> 04:30:17.101 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WERE EASY TO SOLVE

04:30:15.900 --> 04:30:18.069 region:rollup2
AND WERE AMENABLE TO THAT A

04:30:17.101 --> 04:30:19.503 region:rollup2
QUICK AND EASY SOLUTION WOULD

04:30:18.069 --> 04:30:20.805 region:rollup2
HAVE A BY NOW WE DON'T. BECAUSE

04:30:19.503 --> 04:30:23.407 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD AND IT'S TRICKY AND

04:30:20.805 --> 04:30:24.408 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT SO I'M ALSO NOT

04:30:23.407 --> 04:30:25.609 region:rollup2
SHOCKED THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

04:30:24.408 --> 04:30:27.044 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT IN THE FIRST

04:30:25.609 --> 04:30:28.512 region:rollup2

THAT A SIGNIFICANT ABOUT THIS

04:30:37.688 --> 04:30:40.991 region:rollup2
BILL I SHARE THEM WITH YOU WHEN

04:30:39.256 --> 04:30:41.826 region:rollup2

IT REAL QUICKLY I I YOU KNOW WE.

04:30:44.829 --> 04:30:48.966 region:rollup2
.

04:30:46.831 --> 04:30:50.301 region:rollup2
AS AS DEMOCRATS AS AS AS HUMANS

04:30:48.966 --> 04:30:51.702 region:rollup2
CARE DEEPLY ABOUT ACCESS TO HIGH

04:30:50.301 --> 04:30:52.870 region:rollup2
QUALITY HEALTHCARE THAT THAT

04:30:51.702 --> 04:30:54.772 region:rollup2
REALLY DRIVES OUR COMMITMENT TO

04:30:52.870 --> 04:30:55.539 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE.

04:30:54.772 --> 04:30:57.374 region:rollup2
I WONDER IF IT'S GONNA BE

04:30:55.539 --> 04:30:58.342 region:rollup2
UNDERMINED AS AS AN UNINTENDED

04:30:57.374 --> 04:31:00.678 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCE OF POINTS OF THIS

04:30:58.342 --> 04:31:02.246 region:rollup2
BILL. AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU

04:31:00.678 --> 04:31:03.047 region:rollup2
SAID ABOUT REWARDING IN

04:31:02.246 --> 04:31:04.815 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THOSE THAT TAKE ON

04:31:03.047 --> 04:31:07.017 region:rollup2
MORE MEDI CAL.

04:31:04.815 --> 04:31:08.352 region:rollup2
I ALSO HEAR REGULARLY FROM

04:31:07.017 --> 04:31:09.954 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT

04:31:08.352 --> 04:31:10.888 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN PRACTICE THAT.

04:31:09.954 --> 04:31:12.389 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT MIX OF THE

04:31:10.888 --> 04:31:13.858 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL PAYER THAT THAT AND

04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:15.893 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYERS AND MEDICAL

04:31:13.858 --> 04:31:17.695 region:rollup2
PAIRS COMBINED HELP THEM.

04:31:15.893 --> 04:31:18.362 region:rollup2
HAVE A HAVE A BUSINESS THAT'S

04:31:17.695 --> 04:31:19.964 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE ON THAT THE

04:31:18.362 --> 04:31:21.065 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES SUBSIDIZE

04:31:19.964 --> 04:31:22.233 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY THE MEDICARE RIGHT I

04:31:21.065 --> 04:31:24.101 region:rollup2
THINK A MEDIC COUNTIES HAVE TO

04:31:22.233 --> 04:31:25.002 region:rollup2
GET HIGHER THEY JUST DO. SO I'M

04:31:24.101 --> 04:31:26.537 region:rollup2
NOT SAYING THAT YOU THINK THIS

04:31:25.002 --> 04:31:27.638 region:rollup2
IS THE ONLY SOLUTION I AM I

04:31:26.537 --> 04:31:28.973 region:rollup2
THINK WE CAN STILL PURSUE SOME

04:31:27.638 --> 04:31:30.474 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT WE

04:31:28.973 --> 04:31:31.242 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BIG BILLS THE LOT OF US

04:31:30.474 --> 04:31:32.676 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED TO RAISE MEDICARE

04:31:31.242 --> 04:31:33.511 region:rollup2
RATES LIKE THAT SHOULD BE PUT BY

04:31:32.676 --> 04:31:35.412 region:rollup2
THE WAYSIDE.

04:31:33.511 --> 04:31:36.614 region:rollup2
AS BEEF CONTINUE TO EXPLORE

04:31:35.412 --> 04:31:38.048 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE OF IF THAT'S WHAT THE

04:31:36.614 --> 04:31:39.283 region:rollup2
THE WILL THIS BODY HAS. A WAY

04:31:38.048 --> 04:31:41.952 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE PROVIDER SHORTAGE

04:31:39.283 --> 04:31:42.486 region:rollup2
WE'VE WE'VE THAT IN AND WHETHER

04:31:41.952 --> 04:31:43.287 region:rollup2
THIS WILL EXACERBATE IT.

04:31:42.486 --> 04:31:44.455 region:rollup2
IF THIS IS THE ONLY STATE THAT

04:31:43.287 --> 04:31:46.490 region:rollup2
HAS A.

04:31:44.455 --> 04:31:48.592 region:rollup2
AT COMMISSION THAT SETTING RATES

04:31:46.490 --> 04:31:50.361 region:rollup2
AND OTHER STATE DOES.

04:31:48.592 --> 04:31:51.328 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ALREADY HARD TO TO TO

04:31:50.361 --> 04:31:53.597 region:rollup2
TO LIVE HERE AND WORK HERE AS A

04:31:51.328 --> 04:31:53.931 region:rollup2
PROVIDER BECAUSE OF OF STUDENT

04:31:53.597 --> 04:31:55.566 region:rollup2
DAD AND AND.

04:31:53.931 --> 04:31:57.001 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE ON A

04:31:55.566 --> 04:31:58.202 region:rollup2
GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION THE

04:31:57.001 --> 04:31:59.970 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL THAT DO THAT'S BEEN

04:31:58.202 --> 04:32:01.739 region:rollup2
REYES I AND I I I KNOW YOU'VE

04:31:59.970 --> 04:32:02.273 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED IT TO TO SOME EXTENT

04:32:01.739 --> 04:32:03.674 region:rollup2
BUT I STILL THINK THAT'S A

04:32:02.273 --> 04:32:04.675 region:rollup2
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE TO? GET OUR

04:32:03.674 --> 04:32:07.778 region:rollup2
ARMS AROUND.

04:32:04.675 --> 04:32:10.781 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS BILL TAKES ON.

04:32:07.778 --> 04:32:12.016 region:rollup2
SOME COST DRIVERS BUT NOT ALL.

04:32:10.781 --> 04:32:13.951 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE A GLOBAL A

04:32:12.016 --> 04:32:15.452 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL THAT APPROACH AND I

04:32:13.951 --> 04:32:17.221 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE HAVE LIMITS WE HAVE

04:32:15.452 --> 04:32:18.789 region:rollup2
RISA THAT WE HAVE THE COMMERCE

04:32:17.221 --> 04:32:20.324 region:rollup2
CLUB HAS. YOU KNOW I GET THE

04:32:18.789 --> 04:32:22.293 region:rollup2
FEDERAL INTERPLAY WITH STATE LAW

04:32:20.324 --> 04:32:23.961 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T DO IT ALL. BUT I THINK

04:32:22.293 --> 04:32:25.429 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TRY OUT TO THE EXTENT

04:32:23.961 --> 04:32:27.164 region:rollup2
WE CAN ADDRESS ALL COST DRIVERS.

04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:28.799 region:rollup2
AT A HIGH PRICE SPECIALTY DRUGS

04:32:27.164 --> 04:32:32.036 region:rollup2
ARE A COST DRIVER.

04:32:28.799 --> 04:32:34.271 region:rollup2
I. T. SEISMIC. EQUIPMENT.

04:32:32.036 --> 04:32:35.206 region:rollup2
GENERAL WASTE INEFFICIENCY IS

04:32:34.271 --> 04:32:36.941 region:rollup2

04:32:36.941 --> 04:32:40.211 region:rollup2
MAYBE  <u><c.green>WILL LEAVE THAT. IT</c></u>

04:32:38.509 --> 04:32:42.146 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RATES ACCOMPA SOME OF

04:32:40.211 --> 04:32:42.780 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE ALL OF THOSE ME MAYBE

04:32:42.146 --> 04:32:43.647 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T BUT I THINK THOSE ARE

04:32:42.780 --> 04:32:44.748 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE REAL.

04:32:43.647 --> 04:32:46.417 region:rollup2
AND THEN FINALLY YOU KNOW THIS

04:32:44.748 --> 04:32:46.617 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY MY MISS

04:32:46.417 --> 04:32:48.118 region:rollup2
BURKE.

BILLS READY TODAY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WHO

04:34:19.543 --> 04:34:22.346 region:rollup2
THINK IT TO THE AUTHOR FOR

04:34:20.844 --> 04:34:24.848 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION I

04:34:22.346 --> 04:34:27.251 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT?

04:34:24.848 --> 04:34:27.718 region:rollup2
ALL GREAT SOCIETIES ARE DEFINED

04:34:27.251 --> 04:34:29.219 region:rollup2
BY THE COURAGE OF OUR

04:34:27.718 --> 04:34:30.754 region:rollup2
CONVICTIONS

04:34:29.219 --> 04:34:31.322 region:rollup2
TO BE BOLD AND COURAGEOUS IN

04:34:30.754 --> 04:34:33.324 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING ISSUES THAT ARE.

04:34:31.322 --> 04:34:33.891 region:rollup2
HARD.

04:34:33.324 --> 04:34:35.893 region:rollup2
TO DO HARD CONVERSATIONS TO

04:34:33.891 --> 04:34:38.829 region:rollup2
HAVE.

04:34:35.893 --> 04:34:41.565 region:rollup2
I MET WITH YOURSELF WHEN

04:34:38.829 --> 04:34:44.001 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS WITH OPPOSITION.

04:34:41.565 --> 04:34:45.069 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HEAR ALL PERSPECTIVES.

04:34:44.001 --> 04:34:46.236 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

04:34:45.069 --> 04:34:47.404 region:rollup2
TOOK AWAY FROM WAS A YOUNG MAN

04:34:46.236 --> 04:34:49.173 region:rollup2
WHO IS A DOCTOR WHO IS STUDYING

04:34:47.404 --> 04:34:50.474 region:rollup2
TO BECOME A DOCTOR ACTUALLY ON

04:34:49.173 --> 04:34:51.942 region:rollup2
HIS LAST YEAR OF RESIDENCY WHO

04:34:50.474 --> 04:34:53.077 region:rollup2
SAID HE'S GOING TO BE GRADUATING

04:34:51.942 --> 04:34:54.745 region:rollup2
WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

04:34:53.077 --> 04:34:56.280 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN DEBT.

04:34:54.745 --> 04:34:57.648 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU KNOW IS IS A REAL

04:34:56.280 --> 04:34:59.049 region:rollup2
ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD NOT ONLY

04:34:57.648 --> 04:35:00.684 region:rollup2
FOR STATE BUT FOR THE ENTIRE

04:34:59.049 --> 04:35:01.952 region:rollup2
COUNTRY.

04:35:00.684 --> 04:35:03.954 region:rollup2
AND TO THINK ABOUT HIM BECOMING

04:35:01.952 --> 04:35:05.055 region:rollup2
A DOCTOR AND WHAT THAT LOOKS

04:35:03.954 --> 04:35:06.990 region:rollup2
LIKE TO PRACTICE YOU DON'T GO

04:35:05.055 --> 04:35:08.759 region:rollup2
INTO THE FIELD OF MEDICINE OR IN

04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:09.927 region:rollup2
THE FIELD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

04:35:08.759 --> 04:35:10.995 region:rollup2
OR ANY OTHER FIELD BECAUSE

04:35:09.927 --> 04:35:12.997 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN A FOR YOURSELF YOU DO

04:35:10.995 --> 04:35:14.064 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE YOU WANT HELP PEOPLE.

04:35:12.997 --> 04:35:15.199 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT WE'RE IN A

04:35:14.064 --> 04:35:16.467 region:rollup2
SITUATION RIGHT NOW WHERE WE

04:35:15.199 --> 04:35:18.535 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THE COST OF

04:35:16.467 --> 04:35:20.170 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE. IS NOT AFFORDABLE

04:35:18.535 --> 04:35:22.573 region:rollup2
EVEN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS

04:35:20.170 --> 04:35:24.274 region:rollup2
NOT AFFORDABLE AS GOOD AS IT IS.

04:35:22.573 --> 04:35:25.709 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T

04:35:24.274 --> 04:35:27.544 region:rollup2
BEFORE TO BE HONEST THE TO YOUR

04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:28.479 region:rollup2
POINT VERY EARLY ON.

04:35:27.544 --> 04:35:30.614 region:rollup2
IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT

04:35:28.479 --> 04:35:33.684 region:rollup2
RATIONING OF HEALTHCARE.

04:35:30.614 --> 04:35:34.785 region:rollup2
THAT IS A VERY REAL THING.

04:35:33.684 --> 04:35:36.787 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S AN

04:35:34.785 --> 04:35:38.756 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE A

04:35:36.787 --> 04:35:40.524 region:rollup2
BROADER LARGER CONVERSATION

04:35:38.756 --> 04:35:41.992 region:rollup2
ASIDE FROM THIS COMMITTEE WHICH

04:35:40.524 --> 04:35:43.293 region:rollup2
IS CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH TIME WITH

04:35:41.992 --> 04:35:44.928 region:rollup2
ALL THE MANY QUESTIONS AND

04:35:43.293 --> 04:35:46.463 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND COMMENTS THAT.

04:35:44.928 --> 04:35:47.898 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AND I'M SURE

04:35:46.463 --> 04:35:49.333 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC HAS AS WELL AND

04:35:47.898 --> 04:35:51.402 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS HAVE.

04:35:49.333 --> 04:35:53.337 region:rollup2
TO COME TO A FINAL CONCLUSION AS

04:35:51.402 --> 04:35:55.472 region:rollup2
TO WHAT THIS IS WHAT I DO

04:35:53.337 --> 04:35:56.373 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE. OF IT.

04:35:55.472 --> 04:35:57.074 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT SETS THE TONE FOR

04:35:56.373 --> 04:35:59.209 region:rollup2
WHAT THE COMMISSION COULD

04:35:57.074 --> 04:36:00.277 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY BE LIKE.

04:35:59.209 --> 04:36:02.012 region:rollup2
AND THAT IF WE CAN HAVE THIS

04:36:00.277 --> 04:36:03.814 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION HERE.

04:36:02.012 --> 04:36:05.849 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PEOPLE WHILE IT MAY SEEM

04:36:03.814 --> 04:36:06.450 region:rollup2
A SMALL NUMBER IS CERTAINLY MORE

04:36:05.849 --> 04:36:07.551 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS

04:36:06.450 --> 04:36:09.953 region:rollup2
NONE.

04:36:07.551 --> 04:36:11.922 region:rollup2
AND SO TO EVEN COME TO THE TABLE

04:36:09.953 --> 04:36:13.257 region:rollup2
WITH DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS

04:36:11.922 --> 04:36:14.825 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT IDEAS DIFFERENT

04:36:13.257 --> 04:36:16.326 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL

04:36:14.825 --> 04:36:17.461 region:rollup2
WANT TO HEAR I MEAN WE CAN HEAR

04:36:16.326 --> 04:36:18.862 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS ALL DAY

04:36:17.461 --> 04:36:19.630 region:rollup2
LONG.

04:36:18.862 --> 04:36:21.865 region:rollup2
BUT WE WANT TO COME TO A

04:36:19.630 --> 04:36:23.700 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT WE DO TO

04:36:21.865 --> 04:36:26.336 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE.

04:36:23.700 --> 04:36:27.704 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY HAVE AXIS BUT CAN USE.

04:36:26.336 --> 04:36:29.740 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE SO THAT THEY'RE

04:36:27.704 --> 04:36:30.307 region:rollup2
NOT LANDING IN EMERGENCY ROOMS

04:36:29.740 --> 04:36:32.009 region:rollup2
SO THAT THEY'RE NOT WITHOUT

04:36:30.307 --> 04:36:33.844 region:rollup2
CARE.

04:36:32.009 --> 04:36:35.078 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT IS AFFORDABLE AND THE

04:36:33.844 --> 04:36:36.814 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PRACTICE

04:36:35.078 --> 04:36:38.782 region:rollup2
MEDICINE OUR STATE CANNOT.

04:36:36.814 --> 04:36:40.784 region:rollup2
AND SO I COMMEND THE HOSPITALS

04:36:38.782 --> 04:36:42.052 region:rollup2
FOR BEING AT THE FOREFRONT.

04:36:40.784 --> 04:36:44.521 region:rollup2

04:36:42.052 --> 04:36:46.056 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CARE AS WELL AS THE

04:36:44.521 --> 04:36:48.158 region:rollup2
SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL ISN'T.

04:36:46.056 --> 04:36:49.793 region:rollup2
AND IN INTRODUCING IDEAS AND THE

04:36:48.158 --> 04:36:51.328 region:rollup2
THOUGHT PROCESS US TO WHAT WE

04:36:49.793 --> 04:36:52.896 region:rollup2
CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE

04:36:51.328 --> 04:36:54.131 region:rollup2
THAT CALLS CALIFORNIA HOME CAN

04:36:52.896 --> 04:36:56.100 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY

04:36:54.131 --> 04:36:57.468 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE. I THINK THAT'S WHERE

04:36:56.100 --> 04:36:59.136 region:rollup2
WE ALL WANT TO GET OUT I MEAN

04:36:57.468 --> 04:37:00.771 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

04:36:59.136 --> 04:37:02.539 region:rollup2
THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

04:37:00.771 --> 04:37:03.907 region:rollup2
WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

04:37:02.539 --> 04:37:05.609 region:rollup2
MEDICARE AND IDEA THAT.

04:37:03.907 --> 04:37:08.145 region:rollup2
SOME OPPOSED EVEN THE BEGINNING

04:37:05.609 --> 04:37:10.047 region:rollup2
OF THAT SEVERAL DECADES AGO AND

04:37:08.145 --> 04:37:10.747 region:rollup2
NOW HAS PROVIDED.

04:37:10.047 --> 04:37:12.716 region:rollup2
COVERAGE TO MILLIONS OF

04:37:10.747 --> 04:37:13.851 region:rollup2
AMERICANS.

04:37:12.716 --> 04:37:16.453 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY THESE

04:37:13.851 --> 04:37:18.122 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS ARE NEVER EASY.

04:37:16.453 --> 04:37:20.624 region:rollup2
AND CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO

04:37:18.122 --> 04:37:21.792 region:rollup2
COME TO A SOLUTION RIGHT NOW.

04:37:20.624 --> 04:37:22.926 region:rollup2
BUT I HOPE THAT ALL THE

04:37:21.792 --> 04:37:24.161 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS WHETHER THEY'VE

04:37:22.926 --> 04:37:25.596 region:rollup2

04:37:24.161 --> 04:37:26.763 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

04:37:25.596 --> 04:37:28.799 region:rollup2
OR WHETHER.

BECAUSE I BELIEVE. THAT WE CAN

04:37:33.737 --> 04:37:35.906 region:rollup2
COME TO A SOLUTION I DON'T

WANT TO HAVE A SOLUTION.

04:37:38.842 --> 04:37:41.078 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET

04:37:39.443 --> 04:37:42.679 region:rollup2

04:38:43.140 --> 04:38:45.709 region:rollup2
AND CERTAINLY CONVERSATIONS THAT

04:38:43.774 --> 04:38:46.643 region:rollup2
ARE NEED.

04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:48.478 region:rollup2
SO MISS LIMON WE HAVE FIVE

04:38:46.643 --> 04:38:49.813 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WAITING TO SPEAK SO

04:38:48.478 --> 04:38:51.548 region:rollup2
IRATE SO I WILL BUILD UP WITH

04:38:49.813 --> 04:38:55.319 region:rollup2
WALDRON A THINK A LOT OF MY

04:38:51.548 --> 04:38:55.919 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES HAVE SHARED SOME OF

04:38:55.319 --> 04:38:56.520 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS I'M GONNA TRY TO

04:38:55.919 --> 04:38:58.121 region:rollup2
LIMIT IT TO ONE QUESTION FOR

04:38:56.520 --> 04:38:59.189 region:rollup2
EACH SIDE. UP FOR THE SUPPORTERS

04:38:58.121 --> 04:39:01.358 region:rollup2
MY FIRST QUESTION IS.

04:38:59.189 --> 04:39:07.965 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THIS DOESN'T WORK WHAT

04:39:01.358 --> 04:39:10.334 region:rollup2
HAPPENS THEN?

04:39:07.965 --> 04:39:13.203 region:rollup2
WE DEFAULT TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM

04:39:10.334 --> 04:39:15.005 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ALSO NOT WORKING. AND

04:39:13.203 --> 04:39:17.140 region:rollup2
IS DRIVEN BY.

04:39:15.005 --> 04:39:20.277 region:rollup2
PURE MARKET CONSIDERATIONS

04:39:17.140 --> 04:39:22.179 region:rollup2
AND MONOPOLISTIC TAKEOVERS OF

04:39:20.277 --> 04:39:25.115 region:rollup2
OUR HEALTH CARE I MEAN THIS THE

04:39:22.179 --> 04:39:27.284 region:rollup2
CURRENT. REALITY IS.

04:39:25.115 --> 04:39:29.720 region:rollup2
SUPER NOT GREAT AND I THINK THAT

04:39:27.284 --> 04:39:31.488 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE MODELS THAT.

04:39:29.720 --> 04:39:34.658 region:rollup2
WE CAN DRAW FROM THAT WE CAN

04:39:31.488 --> 04:39:36.093 region:rollup2
LEARN FROM AND APPLY. AND REALLY

04:39:34.658 --> 04:39:39.196 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

04:39:36.093 --> 04:39:40.797 region:rollup2
LEAVE HERE SO. IT IT IS YOU KNOW

04:39:39.196 --> 04:39:42.266 region:rollup2
WE'RE TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT

04:39:40.797 --> 04:39:43.200 region:rollup2
IS CHALLENGING WERE TAKING ON

04:39:42.266 --> 04:39:44.935 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT IS ONE OF THE

04:39:43.200 --> 04:39:46.136 region:rollup2
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING OUR

04:39:44.935 --> 04:39:48.005 region:rollup2
STATE TODAY.

04:39:46.136 --> 04:39:50.574 region:rollup2
AND.

04:39:48.005 --> 04:39:52.209 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OVER TIME WE WILL GET

04:39:50.574 --> 04:39:54.244 region:rollup2
TO REALIZE.

04:39:52.209 --> 04:39:56.146 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IF

04:39:54.244 --> 04:39:57.447 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT.

04:39:56.146 --> 04:39:58.682 region:rollup2
OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND I THINK

04:39:57.447 --> 04:40:01.485 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE BIG TAKEAWAY FROM

04:39:58.682 --> 04:40:04.021 region:rollup2
MARYLAND IS WE NEED TO.

04:40:01.485 --> 04:40:05.122 region:rollup2
ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO BE

04:40:04.021 --> 04:40:07.424 region:rollup2
MADE OVER TIME ONE MORE THING

04:40:05.122 --> 04:40:09.459 region:rollup2
ALL SAY ON THAT. THERE IS A TON

04:40:07.424 --> 04:40:10.027 region:rollup2
OF EXPERIMENTATION THAT HAPPENS

04:40:09.459 --> 04:40:11.395 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME AND HEALTHCARE

04:40:10.027 --> 04:40:13.964 region:rollup2
POLICY.

04:40:11.395 --> 04:40:17.234 region:rollup2
PAYMENT REFORM IS ONE BIG

04:40:13.964 --> 04:40:19.503 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENT IN ONE BIG IDEA. THE

04:40:17.234 --> 04:40:22.305 region:rollup2
IDEA OF VALUE VERSUS VOLUME THAT

04:40:19.503 --> 04:40:24.107 region:rollup2
YOU CAN PULL THE MONETARY LEVERS

04:40:22.305 --> 04:40:26.209 region:rollup2
AND MAKE OUTCOMES BE DIFFERENT

04:40:24.107 --> 04:40:28.612 region:rollup2
BASED ON THAT. THAT IS BEING

04:40:26.209 --> 04:40:29.980 region:rollup2
DRIVEN BY BOTH THE PUBLIC SECTOR

04:40:28.612 --> 04:40:31.214 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR

04:40:29.980 --> 04:40:31.682 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EASY TON OF

04:40:31.214 --> 04:40:33.116 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTATION THAT'S

04:40:31.682 --> 04:40:35.986 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

04:40:33.116 --> 04:40:36.853 region:rollup2
AND GUESS WHAT. IN THAT PROCESS.

04:40:35.986 --> 04:40:38.622 region:rollup2
THEIR HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE

04:40:36.853 --> 04:40:41.625 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES.

04:40:38.622 --> 04:40:44.127 region:rollup2
AND WE KEEP GOING BECAUSE TRYING

04:40:41.625 --> 04:40:46.663 region:rollup2
FOR BETTER IS IMPORTANT.

04:40:44.127 --> 04:40:48.498 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR

04:40:46.663 --> 04:40:49.499 region:rollup2
CURRENT REALITY.

04:40:48.498 --> 04:40:52.135 region:rollup2
AND THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE

04:40:49.499 --> 04:40:53.704 region:rollup2
USING IS THAT MARILYN OR WHAT

04:40:52.135 --> 04:40:56.073 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE ARE YOU USING. THAT

04:40:53.704 --> 04:40:57.140 region:rollup2
THIS HAS A CHANCE OF WORKING.

04:40:56.073 --> 04:40:58.942 region:rollup2
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT DATA BUT

04:40:57.140 --> 04:41:00.377 region:rollup2
DATA IS NOT EVIDENCE WHAT'S THE

04:40:58.942 --> 04:41:01.745 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE YOU'RE USING THAT THIS

04:41:00.377 --> 04:41:03.313 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO HELP GET YOU THERE.

04:41:01.745 --> 04:41:05.115 region:rollup2
WELL IT'S THE THE GRAND

04:41:03.313 --> 04:41:06.550 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENT WITH MEDICARE IT'S

04:41:05.115 --> 04:41:08.285 region:rollup2
THE GRAND EXPERIMENT WITH

04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:10.787 region:rollup2
MARYLAND IT IS THE GRAND

04:41:08.285 --> 04:41:12.556 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENT IN MASSACHUSETTS.

04:41:10.787 --> 04:41:14.224 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE COUNTRIES OF

04:41:12.556 --> 04:41:15.559 region:rollup2
FRANCE GERMANY THE NETHERLANDS

04:41:14.224 --> 04:41:17.627 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL USE OUR MEDICARE

04:41:15.559 --> 04:41:18.028 region:rollup2
PAYMENT SYSTEM TO MODEL THEIR

04:41:17.627 --> 04:41:20.297 region:rollup2
OWN.

04:41:18.028 --> 04:41:22.899 region:rollup2
IN FACT I WILL SAY BECAUSE IT

04:41:20.297 --> 04:41:24.401 region:rollup2
HASN'T BEEN SAID TO ME THAT WHEN

04:41:22.899 --> 04:41:26.770 region:rollup2
THEY THAT SELECT COMMITTEE

04:41:24.401 --> 04:41:28.772 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT WHAT IS EVERYBODY ELSE

04:41:26.770 --> 04:41:31.174 region:rollup2
DOING THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

04:41:28.772 --> 04:41:31.742 region:rollup2
THAT'S MAKING THEIR SYSTEMS BOTH

04:41:31.174 --> 04:41:34.511 region:rollup2
CHEAPER AND HIGHER QUALITY.

04:41:31.742 --> 04:41:35.746 region:rollup2
HAVE.

04:41:34.511 --> 04:41:37.748 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE LOWER BUT THEY'RE

04:41:35.746 --> 04:41:39.916 region:rollup2
GETTING BETTER OUTCOMES FROM

04:41:37.748 --> 04:41:41.918 region:rollup2
THEIR SYSTEMS THE ONE THING THEY

04:41:39.916 --> 04:41:45.322 region:rollup2
ALL HAD IN COMMON WAS THAT THEY

04:41:41.918 --> 04:41:48.125 region:rollup2
REGULATED. PRICES.

04:41:45.322 --> 04:41:49.159 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT IS ESSENTIALLY

04:41:48.125 --> 04:41:50.961 region:rollup2
THE STARTING POINT FOR THIS

04:41:49.159 --> 04:41:52.129 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION THE ONE THING THAT

04:41:50.961 --> 04:41:53.697 region:rollup2
ALL INDUSTRIALIZED WEALTHY

04:41:52.129 --> 04:41:54.731 region:rollup2
NATIONS TO IN THEIR HEALTH CARE

04:41:53.697 --> 04:41:56.767 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IS THEY REGULATE PRICES.

04:41:54.731 --> 04:41:58.435 region:rollup2
IN HEALTHCARE.

04:41:56.767 --> 04:42:00.237 region:rollup2
SO I GUESS FOR ME IS A LISTEN TO

04:41:58.435 --> 04:42:02.005 region:rollup2
THIS THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT.

04:42:00.237 --> 04:42:03.540 region:rollup2
.

04:42:02.005 --> 04:42:05.108 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT

04:42:03.540 --> 04:42:05.308 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTATION IS NEEDED BY

04:42:05.108 --> 04:42:06.877 region:rollup2
ALSO.

04:42:05.308 --> 04:42:08.011 region:rollup2
.

04:42:06.877 --> 04:42:09.012 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER THAT WELL

04:42:08.011 --> 04:42:10.781 region:rollup2
WE'LL JUST FAILED LIKE THE

04:42:09.012 --> 04:42:11.481 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS FAILING NOW IS REALLY

04:42:10.781 --> 04:42:13.483 region:rollup2
HARD.

04:42:11.481 --> 04:42:15.185 region:rollup2
IT IT'S JUST A HARD ANSWER TO

04:42:13.483 --> 04:42:16.887 region:rollup2
KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH BECAUSE IF

04:42:15.185 --> 04:42:17.854 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM FAILS. OUR COMMUNITY

04:42:16.887 --> 04:42:19.823 region:rollup2
FEELS WITH IT.

04:42:17.854 --> 04:42:21.224 region:rollup2
.

04:42:19.823 --> 04:42:22.259 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW THIS ARE SOME OF THE

04:42:21.224 --> 04:42:23.560 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING

04:42:22.259 --> 04:42:24.561 region:rollup2
OURSELVES NUMBER ONLY ASKING

04:42:23.560 --> 04:42:26.096 region:rollup2
OURSELVES THESE QUESTIONS

04:42:24.561 --> 04:42:27.297 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CARE AND BECAUSE WERE

04:42:26.096 --> 04:42:29.499 region:rollup2
INVESTED IN TRYING TO SEE WHAT

04:42:27.297 --> 04:42:31.968 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION WOULD BE.

04:42:29.499 --> 04:42:34.171 region:rollup2
AT FOUR IN THE OPPOSITION YOU

04:42:31.968 --> 04:42:36.072 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT AND WANTING TO BE

04:42:34.171 --> 04:42:37.908 region:rollup2
AT THE TABLE TO ADDRESS HEALTH

04:42:36.072 --> 04:42:40.343 region:rollup2
CARE AFFORDABILITY WHAT ARE YOU

04:42:37.908 --> 04:42:42.212 region:rollup2
DOING NOW TO ADDRESS HEALTH CARE

04:42:40.343 --> 04:42:45.182 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY. AND WHAT HAVE YOU

04:42:42.212 --> 04:42:46.883 region:rollup2
PUT ON THE TABLE.

04:42:45.182 --> 04:42:47.984 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE ALL

04:42:46.883 --> 04:42:49.586 region:rollup2
ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOME

04:42:47.984 --> 04:42:50.086 region:rollup2
ANSWERS IT IS AS WE'VE HEARD

04:42:49.586 --> 04:42:52.656 region:rollup2
OTHERS IN THE NATION SAY

04:42:50.086 --> 04:42:54.391 region:rollup2
COMPLEX.

04:42:52.656 --> 04:42:55.792 region:rollup2
WHAT PART OF CMA RIGHT NOW IS

04:42:54.391 --> 04:42:57.661 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CARE FOR ALL

04:42:55.792 --> 04:42:59.396 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COALITION THAT HAS

04:42:57.661 --> 04:43:01.832 region:rollup2
PUT FORWARD OTHER IDEAS ON HOW

04:42:59.396 --> 04:43:02.966 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THE COST?

04:43:01.832 --> 04:43:04.367 region:rollup2
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SUPPORTING

04:43:02.966 --> 04:43:05.335 region:rollup2
THAT COALITION AND SOME OF THE

04:43:04.367 --> 04:43:07.370 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BILLS THAT ARE

04:43:05.335 --> 04:43:08.004 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE NOW.

04:43:07.370 --> 04:43:09.739 region:rollup2
I WILL TELL YOU FROM CALIFORNIA

04:43:08.004 --> 04:43:11.308 region:rollup2
MEDICAL ASSOCIATION STANDPOINT

04:43:09.739 --> 04:43:12.642 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN ANNUAL SESSION.

04:43:11.308 --> 04:43:14.110 region:rollup2
THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING

04:43:12.642 --> 04:43:15.011 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AT THE ANNUAL SESSION

04:43:14.110 --> 04:43:16.379 region:rollup2
OF OUR HOUSE OF DELEGATES

04:43:15.011 --> 04:43:17.914 region:rollup2
REPRESENTING PHYSICIANS IN

04:43:16.379 --> 04:43:19.583 region:rollup2
ALMOST A PRACTICE ALL OVER THE

04:43:17.914 --> 04:43:20.550 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

04:43:19.583 --> 04:43:22.686 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS NOW WE'RE

04:43:20.550 --> 04:43:23.854 region:rollup2
GETTING OUR AGENDA FOR NEXT YEAR

04:43:22.686 --> 04:43:25.188 region:rollup2
WHY NOT NEXT YEAR THIS COMING

04:43:23.854 --> 04:43:26.890 region:rollup2
OCTOBER.

04:43:25.188 --> 04:43:28.158 region:rollup2
AND WELL WE USUALLY TACKLE FOR

04:43:26.890 --> 04:43:29.593 region:rollup2
FIVE MAJOR ISSUES AT THAT

04:43:28.158 --> 04:43:31.094 region:rollup2
MEETING.

04:43:29.593 --> 04:43:32.429 region:rollup2
THE RECOMMENDATION FROM OUR

04:43:31.094 --> 04:43:34.130 region:rollup2
GROUP THAT PUTS TOGETHER THAT

04:43:32.429 --> 04:43:37.501 region:rollup2
AGENDA AND IS NOW GOING TO OUR

04:43:34.130 --> 04:43:38.635 region:rollup2
BOARD. IS AN ALL SESSION ON COST

04:43:37.501 --> 04:43:40.337 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT COST IN AFFORDABLE

04:43:38.635 --> 04:43:42.072 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE.

04:43:40.337 --> 04:43:43.640 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT BLIND TO IT WE ACCEPT

04:43:42.072 --> 04:43:45.408 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE WE WANT TO BE PART

04:43:43.640 --> 04:43:46.810 region:rollup2
OF THAT SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE.

04:43:45.408 --> 04:43:48.245 region:rollup2
AND WE CONTINUE TO BE THERE WHAT

04:43:46.810 --> 04:43:50.380 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR

04:43:48.245 --> 04:43:52.449 region:rollup2
DRACONIAN BACKWARD LOOKING WAYS

04:43:50.380 --> 04:43:53.950 region:rollup2
OF TRYING TO FIX THE SYSTEM.

04:43:52.449 --> 04:43:55.719 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S A

04:43:53.950 --> 04:43:57.587 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION HAPPENING BUT I

04:43:55.719 --> 04:43:59.689 region:rollup2
ALSO THINK THAT THERE HAS TO BE

04:43:57.587 --> 04:44:00.891 region:rollup2
SOMETHING MORE CONCRETE PUTS A

04:43:59.689 --> 04:44:02.225 region:rollup2
TABLE WE'VE HAD A YEARS OF

04:44:00.891 --> 04:44:05.462 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT OUR SYSTEM THAT

04:44:02.225 --> 04:44:06.463 region:rollup2
NEEDED FIXING. I'M AND I SPENT

04:44:05.462 --> 04:44:07.797 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MORE THAN TWO HOURS

04:44:06.463 --> 04:44:09.132 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WITH LOCAL CMA

04:44:07.797 --> 04:44:10.534 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES TALKING ABOUT

04:44:09.132 --> 04:44:11.835 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:44:10.534 --> 04:44:13.270 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CAME OUT AFTER A TWO

04:44:11.835 --> 04:44:15.305 region:rollup2
HOUR CONVERSATION IS THEIR

04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:15.839 region:rollup2
REGRET THAT THEY HAVEN'T BROUGHT

04:44:15.305 --> 04:44:18.074 region:rollup2
A CONCRETE SOLUTION TO THE

04:44:15.839 --> 04:44:19.709 region:rollup2
TABLE.

04:44:18.074 --> 04:44:21.745 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SO I

04:44:19.709 --> 04:44:23.446 region:rollup2
THINK A LESSON FOR EVERYBODY OUT

04:44:21.745 --> 04:44:25.849 region:rollup2
THERE IS UNLESS WE'RE BRINGING

04:44:23.446 --> 04:44:27.517 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS TO THE TABLE.

04:44:25.849 --> 04:44:30.287 region:rollup2
THIS IS GOING TO KEEP HAPPENING

04:44:27.517 --> 04:44:32.088 region:rollup2
UP AYE ICY THIS BILL AS A

04:44:30.287 --> 04:44:35.091 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND THAT NEEDS TO

04:44:32.088 --> 04:44:35.525 region:rollup2
HAPPEN I'VE SAID IF THERE'S NOT

04:44:35.091 --> 04:44:37.394 region:rollup2
A BILL THERE'S NOT A

04:44:35.525 --> 04:44:38.061 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

04:44:37.394 --> 04:44:38.962 region:rollup2
UGH BUT I HAVE GREAT CONCERNS I

04:44:38.061 --> 04:44:40.463 region:rollup2
HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE

04:44:38.962 --> 04:44:42.299 region:rollup2
BILL BECAUSE.

04:44:40.463 --> 04:44:43.767 region:rollup2
YET WHAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS

04:44:42.299 --> 04:44:45.468 region:rollup2
URBAN AND RURAL WELL AS THE

04:44:43.767 --> 04:44:47.304 region:rollup2
SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY THERE'S A

04:44:45.468 --> 04:44:49.005 region:rollup2
WHOLE LOT IN BETWEEN. AND IN A

04:44:47.304 --> 04:44:51.341 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT HAS A HIGH COST

04:44:49.005 --> 04:44:52.809 region:rollup2
OF LIVING WHERE I MYSELF CAN

04:44:51.341 --> 04:44:55.345 region:rollup2
ONLY GO SEE A PROVIDER ON A

04:44:52.809 --> 04:44:57.013 region:rollup2
FRIDAY OR SATURDAY. AND THAT

04:44:55.345 --> 04:44:58.448 region:rollup2
ALONE IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO

04:44:57.013 --> 04:45:01.351 region:rollup2
FIND.

04:44:58.448 --> 04:45:04.287 region:rollup2
I I I THINK BACK TO THIS IDEA

04:45:01.351 --> 04:45:07.924 region:rollup2
WILL THIS IS GREAT. IF YOU. IF

04:45:04.287 --> 04:45:09.426 region:rollup2
YOU END UP AYE CAPPING RATES.

04:45:07.924 --> 04:45:11.828 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA HELP FOLKS BUT WHAT

04:45:09.426 --> 04:45:13.463 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IF THE RATES ARE CAPPED

04:45:11.828 --> 04:45:15.565 region:rollup2
AND I CAN'T FIND A HOSPITAL OR

04:45:13.463 --> 04:45:18.435 region:rollup2
DOCTOR IT DOES ME AND MY

04:45:15.565 --> 04:45:20.370 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY NO GOOD. TO CAP RATES

04:45:18.435 --> 04:45:22.005 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NOT A DOCTOR TO SEE

04:45:20.370 --> 04:45:23.340 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITAL TO GO TO AND I

04:45:22.005 --> 04:45:24.641 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THIS IS PART OF THE

04:45:23.340 --> 04:45:27.510 region:rollup2
GREATER CONVERSATION.

04:45:24.641 --> 04:45:29.746 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS PART OF THE CONCERN

04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:31.448 region:rollup2
UP THAT I HAVE. I AM GOING TO

04:45:29.746 --> 04:45:33.016 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I HAVE A

04:45:31.448 --> 04:45:34.451 region:rollup2
LOT OF RESERVATIONS ABOUT THIS

04:45:33.016 --> 04:45:35.986 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS BEEN SAID THERE'S A

04:45:34.451 --> 04:45:37.087 region:rollup2
LOT AT TO CONSIDER AND I DON'T

04:45:35.986 --> 04:45:38.622 region:rollup2
WANT A REPEAT A LOT OF THE

04:45:37.087 --> 04:45:39.556 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I THINK.

04:45:38.622 --> 04:45:41.024 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID.

04:45:39.556 --> 04:45:42.859 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT US TO THINK ABOUT

04:45:41.024 --> 04:45:44.027 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IN SOME COMMUNITIES

04:45:42.859 --> 04:45:46.162 region:rollup2
THAT IS REALLY.

04:45:44.027 --> 04:45:48.631 region:rollup2
THE FEAR AND WERE NOT DRIVEN ON

04:45:46.162 --> 04:45:49.933 region:rollup2
FEAR THAT FEAR IS REAL I TALKED

04:45:48.631 --> 04:45:51.368 region:rollup2
TO HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN MY

04:45:49.933 --> 04:45:52.736 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT STRUGGLE TO

04:45:51.368 --> 04:45:54.571 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO PEOPLE

04:45:52.736 --> 04:45:55.405 region:rollup2
SAY WILL GO TO A KAISER GUESS

04:45:54.571 --> 04:45:55.872 region:rollup2

04:45:55.405 --> 04:45:58.074 region:rollup2
LIVE.

04:45:55.872 --> 04:46:00.543 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S.

04:45:58.074 --> 04:46:02.078 region:rollup2
SOMETHING DATA I WILL BE TAKEN

04:46:00.543 --> 04:46:03.646 region:rollup2
INTO CONSIDERATION AND AS THIS

04:46:02.078 --> 04:46:05.415 region:rollup2
BILL MOVES FORWARD I WILL

04:46:03.646 --> 04:46:06.583 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN

04:46:05.415 --> 04:46:08.818 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT.

04:46:06.583 --> 04:46:10.854 region:rollup2
BUT I DEFINITELY AT I

04:46:08.818 --> 04:46:12.689 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S REASON

04:46:10.854 --> 04:46:14.057 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I

04:46:12.689 --> 04:46:15.492 region:rollup2
HOPE THAT WE WILL SEE A

04:46:14.057 --> 04:46:17.427 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EFFORT AN EFFORT.

04:46:15.492 --> 04:46:20.263 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY STARTS TO MAKE

04:46:17.427 --> 04:46:23.133 region:rollup2
COMPROMISES AROUND WHAT NEEDS TO

04:46:20.263 --> 04:46:25.235 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO MOVE THIS FORWARD.

IN ONE OF MY BIGGEST DRIVERS

04:47:31.768 --> 04:47:34.871 region:rollup2
BEING ON HEALTH COMMITTEE HAS

04:48:44.874 --> 04:48:50.079 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS M. CCS FOR EXAMPLE IS A

04:48:47.844 --> 04:48:51.948 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PROGRAM. WHOSE REACH

04:48:50.079 --> 04:48:53.983 region:rollup2
GOES FAR BEYOND THE MEDI CAL

04:48:51.948 --> 04:48:56.019 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS IF YOU HAVE

04:48:53.983 --> 04:48:57.687 region:rollup2
A VERY SICK CHILD WHOSE HEALTH

04:48:56.019 --> 04:48:59.522 region:rollup2
CARE EXPENSES WOULD EXCEED A

04:48:57.687 --> 04:49:01.558 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE FAMILY'S

04:48:59.522 --> 04:49:03.393 region:rollup2
INCOME. THAT FAMILY CAN QUALIFY

04:49:01.558 --> 04:49:04.827 region:rollup2
FOR CCS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

04:49:03.393 --> 04:49:06.729 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE WE HAVE

04:49:04.827 --> 04:49:08.164 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WHICH ALSO SERVES

04:49:06.729 --> 04:49:11.701 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.

04:49:08.164 --> 04:49:13.703 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY OF OF THE HIGH

04:49:11.701 --> 04:49:15.405 region:rollup2
NEEDS POPULATIONS YOU'RE TALKING

04:49:13.703 --> 04:49:18.041 region:rollup2
ABOUT ARE ALREADY COVERED.

04:49:15.405 --> 04:49:19.309 region:rollup2
UNDER PUBLIC PROGRAMS.

04:49:18.041 --> 04:49:20.276 region:rollup2
THIS BILL IS SPECIFICALLY

04:49:19.309 --> 04:49:22.478 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TO LOOK AT THE

04:49:20.276 --> 04:49:23.046 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL MARKET TO THE EXTENT

04:49:22.478 --> 04:49:24.214 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO HAVE INDIVIDUALS

04:49:23.046 --> 04:49:29.152 region:rollup2
WITH.

04:49:24.214 --> 04:49:29.152 region:rollup2
VERY S. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH CARE

04:49:29.219 --> 04:49:32.989 region:rollup2
MEDICARE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS

04:49:31.154 --> 04:49:35.558 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

04:49:32.989 --> 04:49:36.960 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY SORT OF SET UP

04:49:35.558 --> 04:49:38.728 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THOSE I'M

04:49:36.960 --> 04:49:40.430 region:rollup2
REIMBURSEMENTS BECAUSE THEY DO

04:49:38.728 --> 04:49:42.365 region:rollup2
COVER I'M VERY SICK POPULATIONS

04:49:40.430 --> 04:49:44.067 region:rollup2
ALREADY.

04:49:42.365 --> 04:49:45.768 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH RARE

04:49:44.067 --> 04:49:47.537 region:rollup2
DISEASE AND GENETIC INVOLVED

04:49:45.768 --> 04:49:49.239 region:rollup2
DISEASE IS THAT.

04:49:47.537 --> 04:49:51.541 region:rollup2
IT CAN TAKE UP TO EIGHT YEARS

04:49:49.239 --> 04:49:53.443 region:rollup2
BEFORE PEOPLE EVEN DIAGNOSED.

04:49:51.541 --> 04:49:55.745 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT POINT THERE PROBABLY

04:49:53.443 --> 04:49:57.447 region:rollup2
COULD BE IN A COMMERCIAL PLAN.

04:49:55.745 --> 04:49:59.415 region:rollup2
NOT IN THE MEDICARE PLAN.

04:49:57.447 --> 04:50:01.117 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE PROVIDERS THAT ARE

04:49:59.415 --> 04:50:02.719 region:rollup2

RECORD BECAUSE.

04:50:05.588 --> 04:50:10.560 region:rollup2

COMMITTEES TO THAT.

04:50:15.465 --> 04:50:18.868 region:rollup2
NO THERE'S SOME UNIQUE CASES

04:50:17.667 --> 04:50:21.004 region:rollup2
THAT WE WANT TO BE SURE THOSE

04:50:18.868 --> 04:50:22.238 region:rollup2
PATIENTS STILL HAVE CARE.

04:50:21.004 --> 04:50:23.239 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING OUT ON

THOSE UNIQUE SITUATIONS AND

04:50:24.674 --> 04:50:27.443 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

04:50:26.009 --> 04:50:28.912 region:rollup2
WILL BE COUNTY FOUR AS INDICATED

04:50:27.443 --> 04:50:31.014 region:rollup2

TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

04:50:32.382 --> 04:50:35.251 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS THAT'S NOT THE CASE

04:50:33.816 --> 04:50:36.185 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY THAT THOSE WOULD BE

04:50:35.251 --> 04:50:37.954 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WILL BE OUT OF THE

04:50:36.185 --> 04:50:40.523 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AS TO. HOW WE SET

04:50:37.954 --> 04:50:42.725 region:rollup2
UP BY THE ENSURE QUALITY

04:50:40.523 --> 04:50:43.860 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES OCCUR?

04:50:42.725 --> 04:50:44.527 region:rollup2
ON IT IN A SMALL MARKET REFERRAL

04:50:43.860 --> 04:50:46.229 region:rollup2
SPAWNED A IS SO MY COMMENTS WERE

04:50:44.527 --> 04:50:47.597 region:rollup2
COMPARING CALIFORNIA TO

04:50:46.229 --> 04:50:48.831 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

04:50:47.597 --> 04:50:50.300 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN HERE IS NOT

04:50:48.831 --> 04:50:51.934 region:rollup2
OR DOCTORS GOING TO CANADA TO

04:50:50.300 --> 04:50:54.203 region:rollup2
OUR DOCTORS GOING TO OREGON SO

04:50:51.934 --> 04:50:56.005 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS IT WOULD BE.

04:50:54.203 --> 04:50:57.240 region:rollup2
NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT FUNDED BY

04:50:56.005 --> 04:50:58.942 region:rollup2
BETTER CAL BUT THERE'S JUST NO

04:50:57.240 --> 04:51:00.543 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE

04:50:58.942 --> 04:51:01.144 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

04:51:00.543 --> 04:51:01.678 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT WE ARE CONCERNED

04:51:01.144 --> 04:51:01.878 region:rollup2
THERE.

04:51:01.678 --> 04:51:04.380 region:rollup2
OKAY.

04:51:01.878 --> 04:51:06.182 region:rollup2
.

04:51:04.380 --> 04:51:08.084 region:rollup2
YEAH I WANT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT

04:51:06.182 --> 04:51:09.819 region:rollup2
MEDICAL NECESSITY HOPE THAT THE

04:51:08.084 --> 04:51:11.187 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THE COMMISSION WITH

04:51:09.819 --> 04:51:15.558 region:rollup2
THE FIND THAT.

04:51:11.187 --> 04:51:16.859 region:rollup2
SO REGARDING FOREIGN MILITARIES.

04:51:15.558 --> 04:51:18.127 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS AN

04:51:16.859 --> 04:51:19.662 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN AN

04:51:18.127 --> 04:51:20.596 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR ME TRYING TO GET

04:51:19.662 --> 04:51:22.365 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ACCESS.

04:51:20.596 --> 04:51:22.966 region:rollup2
THE.

04:51:22.365 --> 04:51:24.534 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT THE PHYSICIAN

04:51:22.966 --> 04:51:26.636 region:rollup2
WANTS.

04:51:24.534 --> 04:51:28.504 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT I HAVE.

04:51:26.636 --> 04:51:30.073 region:rollup2
WILL ACCEPTING TREATMENTS REMAIN

04:51:28.504 --> 04:51:32.442 region:rollup2
UNCHANGED TO WORSEN UNDER THIS

04:51:30.073 --> 04:51:33.676 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

04:51:32.442 --> 04:51:35.311 region:rollup2
THE HOPE THAT IT THAT THE THE

04:51:33.676 --> 04:51:36.579 region:rollup2
GREATER ACCESS MEANING YOU CRANK

04:51:35.311 --> 04:51:37.480 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE OF THE HOPE OF THE

04:51:36.579 --> 04:51:39.115 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WERE CERTAINLY NOT

04:51:37.480 --> 04:51:40.750 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO CHANGE ACCESS. OR

04:51:39.115 --> 04:51:41.284 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE ABILITY FOR DOCTORS

04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:42.752 region:rollup2
OR HOSPITALS BUILT RETREAT

04:51:41.284 --> 04:51:45.621 region:rollup2
PATIENTS.

04:51:42.752 --> 04:51:48.658 region:rollup2
INSULT THE IT COULD INCREASE

04:51:45.621 --> 04:51:49.425 region:rollup2
ACCESS BY BOB IN IN CERTAIN

04:51:48.658 --> 04:51:51.294 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE MAY NOT

04:51:49.425 --> 04:51:52.495 region:rollup2
BE ACCESS RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVE

04:51:51.294 --> 04:51:54.197 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY FOR A DOCTOR TO BE

04:51:52.495 --> 04:51:55.264 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. UP

04:51:54.197 --> 04:51:55.932 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY COULD GET HIGHER

04:51:55.264 --> 04:51:57.266 region:rollup2
COMMERCIAL RACING THEY CURRENTLY

04:51:55.932 --> 04:51:59.202 region:rollup2
GET THAN YOU COULD ACTUALLY

04:51:57.266 --> 04:52:01.170 region:rollup2
INCREASE ACCESS BUT ABSOLUTELY

04:51:59.202 --> 04:52:02.238 region:rollup2
NOT NOT INTENDING ON REDUCING

04:52:01.170 --> 04:52:03.439 region:rollup2
ACCESS AT ALL IN ANY WAY.

04:52:02.238 --> 04:52:04.807 region:rollup2
SO THE FORMULA AREAS THAN WITH

04:52:03.439 --> 04:52:06.309 region:rollup2
THOUGHT BECAUSE.

04:52:04.807 --> 04:52:08.745 region:rollup2
THE FORMALLY ORDERS AS THEY

04:52:06.309 --> 04:52:10.747 region:rollup2
STAND NOW WITH. REMAIN NO

04:52:08.745 --> 04:52:15.818 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO CLINICAL PRACTICE

04:52:10.747 --> 04:52:17.620 region:rollup2
WOULD BE MADE UNDER THE SPELL.

04:52:15.818 --> 04:52:20.123 region:rollup2
OKAY BECAUSE PART OF THEIR.

04:52:17.620 --> 04:52:21.324 region:rollup2
DRIVING IS TO LOOK AT REDUCING

04:52:20.123 --> 04:52:22.825 region:rollup2
THE COST OF DRUGS AND MEDICAL

04:52:21.324 --> 04:52:22.992 region:rollup2
DEVICES.

04:52:22.825 --> 04:52:26.596 region:rollup2
AND.

04:52:22.992 --> 04:52:28.297 region:rollup2
.

04:52:26.596 --> 04:52:29.799 region:rollup2
CONTROL HER IN STATE HEALTH CARE

04:52:28.297 --> 04:52:30.867 region:rollup2
COSTS OF ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

04:52:29.799 --> 04:52:32.702 region:rollup2
THAT CAME OUT IN THE SINGLE

04:52:30.867 --> 04:52:35.271 region:rollup2
PAYER COMMITTEE WAS.

04:52:32.702 --> 04:52:36.305 region:rollup2
FORMULARIES AND DRUGS AND TRYING

04:52:35.271 --> 04:52:38.207 region:rollup2
TO MATCH THEM UP TO.

04:52:36.305 --> 04:52:39.842 region:rollup2
.

04:52:38.207 --> 04:52:41.344 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE VETERANS

04:52:39.842 --> 04:52:43.246 region:rollup2
AFFAIRS AND THEN.

04:52:41.344 --> 04:52:44.647 region:rollup2
THEREFORE MILLER SO I'M JUST

04:52:43.246 --> 04:52:47.283 region:rollup2
CONCERNED BECAUSE I WANT TO

04:52:44.647 --> 04:52:50.953 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE FOR MILLER ACCESS

04:52:47.283 --> 04:52:53.256 region:rollup2
NOT RESTRICTED FURTHER.

04:52:50.953 --> 04:52:54.724 region:rollup2
OKAY.

04:52:53.256 --> 04:52:57.593 region:rollup2
SO THE BILL ADDRESSES HEALTH

04:52:54.724 --> 04:52:59.662 region:rollup2
PLAN PREMIUMS.

04:52:57.593 --> 04:53:00.930 region:rollup2
.

04:52:59.662 --> 04:53:01.531 region:rollup2
ALL THE DIFFERENT PLANS A

04:53:00.930 --> 04:53:02.031 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THOUGH THAN DESIGNED

04:53:01.531 --> 04:53:04.400 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY.

04:53:02.031 --> 04:53:05.001 region:rollup2
I'M.

04:53:04.400 --> 04:53:06.836 region:rollup2
HOW DOES THE BILL DO ANYTHING

04:53:05.001 --> 04:53:08.638 region:rollup2
TO?

04:53:06.836 --> 04:53:10.706 region:rollup2
PREVENT

04:53:08.638 --> 04:53:12.308 region:rollup2
THE CALLS FROM FROM SIMPLY BEING

04:53:10.706 --> 04:53:12.909 region:rollup2
PASSED THOUGHT THAT THOUGH COST

04:53:12.308 --> 04:53:18.815 region:rollup2
OF THE PREMIUMS COPAYS BECAUSE

04:53:12.909 --> 04:53:19.382 region:rollup2
NOW THEY.

04:53:18.815 --> 04:53:21.517 region:rollup2
PREMIUMS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

04:53:19.382 --> 04:53:23.719 region:rollup2
REDUCED

04:53:21.517 --> 04:53:24.720 region:rollup2
BUT SOMEWHERE THAT COSTS US A

04:53:23.719 --> 04:53:26.222 region:rollup2
GOES LIKE SQUEEZING A TO.

04:53:24.720 --> 04:53:28.224 region:rollup2
TOOTH PASTE STIR

04:53:26.222 --> 04:53:28.825 region:rollup2
IT GOES ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER

04:53:28.224 --> 04:53:29.325 region:rollup2
THE COSTS ARE NOT GOING TO GO

04:53:28.825 --> 04:53:31.527 region:rollup2
AWAY.

04:53:29.325 --> 04:53:32.495 region:rollup2
SO.

04:53:31.527 --> 04:53:35.264 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO PREVENT THAT

04:53:32.495 --> 04:53:39.402 region:rollup2
FROM BEING PUSHED ONTO HIGHER

04:53:35.264 --> 04:53:41.003 region:rollup2
DEDUCTIBLES OR CO PAYS.

04:53:39.402 --> 04:53:42.538 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CHAIR BY MAY AND

04:53:41.003 --> 04:53:43.372 region:rollup2
MISS WALDRON TO GREAT QUESTION

04:53:42.538 --> 04:53:45.341 region:rollup2
AND.

04:53:43.372 --> 04:53:49.212 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL

04:53:45.341 --> 04:53:51.280 region:rollup2
LAWS RELATING TO UP CAPPING AND

04:53:49.212 --> 04:53:52.949 region:rollup2
PREVENT AND AND WENT MANAGING

04:53:51.280 --> 04:53:54.617 region:rollup2
OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE STILL IN

04:53:52.949 --> 04:53:57.353 region:rollup2
PLACE THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

04:53:54.617 --> 04:54:00.223 region:rollup2
HAS LIMITS. ON WHAT INDIVIDUALS

04:53:57.353 --> 04:54:02.125 region:rollup2
CAN PAY OUT OF POCKET AND YEARLY

04:54:00.223 --> 04:54:03.593 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LIMITS ON DEDUCTIBLES

04:54:02.125 --> 04:54:04.961 region:rollup2
THAT CURRENTLY AT SEVEN THOUSAND

04:54:03.593 --> 04:54:07.196 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FOR AN

04:54:04.961 --> 04:54:10.233 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL. ALL OF THAT IS IN

04:54:07.196 --> 04:54:13.536 region:rollup2
PLACE THERE'S ALSO LIMITS ON.

04:54:10.233 --> 04:54:14.937 region:rollup2
PREVENTING HEALTH PLANS FROM

04:54:13.536 --> 04:54:16.172 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO HAVE A LIMIT ON

04:54:14.937 --> 04:54:18.374 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH CARE THEY PAY FOR

04:54:16.172 --> 04:54:20.076 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY OR OVER A LIFETIME SO

04:54:18.374 --> 04:54:21.477 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE GOT RID OF LIFETIME

04:54:20.076 --> 04:54:22.545 region:rollup2
LIMITS. IN THEIR STATE

04:54:21.477 --> 04:54:25.214 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS IN TERMS OF NETWORK

04:54:22.545 --> 04:54:29.118 region:rollup2
OUT TO SEA ADEQUACY TIMELY. AND

04:54:25.214 --> 04:54:29.118 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE AND LANGUAGE

04:54:29.185 --> 04:54:32.455 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS ALL THE PROTECTIONS

04:54:31.454 --> 04:54:35.191 region:rollup2
AROUND.

04:54:32.455 --> 04:54:37.126 region:rollup2
TAPPING OUT OF POCKET COSTS ARE

04:54:35.191 --> 04:54:38.227 region:rollup2
THEY ALL STAY IN PLACE UNDER

04:54:37.126 --> 04:54:40.496 region:rollup2
THIS LAW.

04:54:38.227 --> 04:54:45.935 region:rollup2
SO WHERE WITH THE COSTS AGO

04:54:40.496 --> 04:54:48.271 region:rollup2
WOMEN HOW THAT THE COVERS.

04:54:45.935 --> 04:54:50.973 region:rollup2
THE IDEA IS THAT OF THIS BILL IS

04:54:48.271 --> 04:54:53.176 region:rollup2
TO REALLY GET AT PRICES.

04:54:50.973 --> 04:54:54.944 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION HAS GONE DOWN IN

04:54:53.176 --> 04:54:57.713 region:rollup2
THIS COUNTRY AND PRICES HAVE

04:54:54.944 --> 04:55:00.049 region:rollup2
SKYROCKETED. AND SO THE IDEA IS

04:54:57.713 --> 04:55:02.485 region:rollup2
TO GUIDE OF GET A HANDLE ON THE

04:55:00.049 --> 04:55:03.653 region:rollup2
PRICES THAT ARE CHARGED.

04:55:02.485 --> 04:55:05.288 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S AND WE'VE SEEN WE

04:55:03.653 --> 04:55:06.789 region:rollup2
DID S. B. FIVE WAS SPONSORED S.

04:55:05.288 --> 04:55:08.391 region:rollup2
B. FIVE FORTY SIX.

04:55:06.789 --> 04:55:10.293 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH BROUGHT

04:55:08.391 --> 04:55:12.528 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY TO THE WAY HEALTH

04:55:10.293 --> 04:55:14.630 region:rollup2
PLAN SET PREMIUMS AND FOR THE

04:55:12.528 --> 04:55:16.399 region:rollup2
LARGE GROUP. AND WE HAVE NOW TWO

04:55:14.630 --> 04:55:18.267 region:rollup2
YEARS OF ROBUST DATA THERE'S

04:55:16.399 --> 04:55:20.102 region:rollup2
BEEN TWO PUBLIC MEETINGS.

04:55:18.267 --> 04:55:22.939 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

04:55:20.102 --> 04:55:23.906 region:rollup2
SHOWED IS THAT A BIG DRIVER ONE

04:55:22.939 --> 04:55:26.342 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY

04:55:23.906 --> 04:55:28.144 region:rollup2
DRIVING INCREASES IN PREMIUMS

04:55:26.342 --> 04:55:29.946 region:rollup2
AND WHAT CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING

04:55:28.144 --> 04:55:32.048 region:rollup2
OUT OF POCKET. IS DOCTORS AND

04:55:29.946 --> 04:55:33.216 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS.

04:55:32.048 --> 04:55:34.250 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS A PIECE OF

04:55:33.216 --> 04:55:35.651 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE ONE OF THE FASTEST

04:55:34.250 --> 04:55:37.486 region:rollup2
GROWING.

04:55:35.651 --> 04:55:40.456 region:rollup2
PARTS DRIVER COST DRIVERS IN OUR

04:55:37.486 --> 04:55:42.291 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS

04:55:40.456 --> 04:55:42.925 region:rollup2
ARE THE BIGGEST CHUNK OF WHAT WE

04:55:42.291 --> 04:55:46.762 region:rollup2
ARE SPENDING OUR PREMIUM DOLLARS

04:55:42.925 --> 04:55:47.797 region:rollup2
ON.

04:55:46.762 --> 04:55:49.232 region:rollup2
JUST BRIEFLY DOCTORS AND

04:55:47.797 --> 04:55:50.299 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS ARE THE MAIN PART OF

04:55:49.232 --> 04:55:53.903 region:rollup2
ANY MEDICAL SERVICE SO THAT

04:55:50.299 --> 04:55:57.473 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

04:55:53.903 --> 04:55:59.041 region:rollup2
OKAY A I THINK WE WE WANT CEMEX

04:55:57.473 --> 04:56:00.476 region:rollup2
VERY QUICKLY.

04:55:59.041 --> 04:56:01.477 region:rollup2
OKAY SO AS FAR AS.

04:56:00.476 --> 04:56:04.213 region:rollup2
HOW MANY HOSPITALS ARE IN

04:56:01.477 --> 04:56:04.847 region:rollup2
MARYLAND?

04:56:04.213 --> 04:56:06.382 region:rollup2
FORTY HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF

04:56:04.847 --> 04:56:08.951 region:rollup2
MARYLAND.

04:56:06.382 --> 04:56:10.219 region:rollup2
SO FORTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO.

04:56:08.951 --> 04:56:12.588 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THOSE ON THE COMMITTEE

04:56:10.219 --> 04:56:14.223 region:rollup2
THEY HAD AT THE TIME THEY HAD

04:56:12.588 --> 04:56:15.524 region:rollup2
RATES SETTINGS BUT.

04:56:14.223 --> 04:56:17.426 region:rollup2
I WAS JUST DOING SIMPLE MATH IF

04:56:15.524 --> 04:56:18.227 region:rollup2
YOU SUBTRACT.

04:56:17.426 --> 04:56:20.296 region:rollup2
CHRISTMAS WEEK AND.

04:56:18.227 --> 04:56:22.331 region:rollup2
.

04:56:20.296 --> 04:56:24.433 region:rollup2
NEW YEAR'S WEEK THAT'S FIFTY

04:56:22.331 --> 04:56:26.569 region:rollup2

HOSPITALS THAT'S EIGHT WEEKS

04:56:26.569 --> 04:56:29.205 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE WOULD HAVE TO BE

04:56:27.536 --> 04:56:30.906 region:rollup2
WORKED ON NOT EVEN TO MENTION

04:56:29.205 --> 04:56:32.808 region:rollup2
THE HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR SO

04:56:30.906 --> 04:56:35.244 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS.

04:56:32.808 --> 04:56:36.679 region:rollup2
WITH ACTUAR EARLY ACTUARIAL IS A

04:56:35.244 --> 04:56:38.147 region:rollup2
RETURN ON INVESTMENT ALL OF THE

04:56:36.679 --> 04:56:39.949 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAVE TO LOOK AT.

04:56:38.147 --> 04:56:42.051 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A HUGE STAFF.

04:56:39.949 --> 04:56:44.654 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST.

04:56:42.051 --> 04:56:45.888 region:rollup2
COMMENTS. IF I MAY ASSEMBLY

04:56:44.654 --> 04:56:46.856 region:rollup2
MEMBER AND IN THE STATE OF

04:56:45.888 --> 04:56:49.125 region:rollup2
MARYLAND REMEMBER THE RATE

04:56:46.856 --> 04:56:51.093 region:rollup2
SETTING SYSTEM WAS ALL ABOUT

04:56:49.125 --> 04:56:52.528 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE RATE OF INCREASE.

04:56:51.093 --> 04:56:54.297 region:rollup2
IT DID NOT LOOK AT WHAT THIS

04:56:52.528 --> 04:56:57.166 region:rollup2
BILL IS PROPOSING IN THAT IS TO

04:56:54.297 --> 04:56:58.868 region:rollup2
SET. INDIVIDUAL RATES AT SOME

04:56:57.166 --> 04:57:01.370 region:rollup2
BASE

04:56:58.868 --> 04:57:03.305 region:rollup2
FOR ALL PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS

04:57:01.370 --> 04:57:04.740 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITALS FORTY HOSPITALS

04:57:03.305 --> 04:57:06.509 region:rollup2
ONLY AND WAS TO CONTROL THE RATE

04:57:04.740 --> 04:57:07.677 region:rollup2
OF INCREASE OVER TIME.

04:57:06.509 --> 04:57:09.979 region:rollup2
OKAY JUST VERY QUICKLY COMMENTS

04:57:07.677 --> 04:57:12.181 region:rollup2
ON THEM.

04:57:09.979 --> 04:57:17.553 region:rollup2
.

04:57:12.181 --> 04:57:19.622 region:rollup2
OKAY SO.

04:57:17.553 --> 04:57:20.790 region:rollup2
SO PLAYERS YOU KNOW SEEM TO BE

04:57:19.622 --> 04:57:22.324 region:rollup2
MOVING TO COMPARATIVE

04:57:20.790 --> 04:57:24.727 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT AND

04:57:22.324 --> 04:57:25.961 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN ORDER TO DECIDE.

04:57:24.727 --> 04:57:27.563 region:rollup2
WHAT TO PAY FOR A MONTH NOT TO

04:57:25.961 --> 04:57:28.998 region:rollup2
PAY FOR?

04:57:27.563 --> 04:57:30.566 region:rollup2
BUT FOR PATIENTS WITH RARE

04:57:28.998 --> 04:57:32.234 region:rollup2
DISEASES AND OTHER CHRONIC

04:57:30.566 --> 04:57:34.136 region:rollup2
DISEASES YOU KNOW.

04:57:32.234 --> 04:57:36.339 region:rollup2
ARE EXPENSIVE TO TREAT THE REAL

04:57:34.136 --> 04:57:38.908 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THAT.

04:57:36.339 --> 04:57:40.743 region:rollup2
A NEW PAYER LIKE AN OLD PAIR OF

04:57:38.908 --> 04:57:42.778 region:rollup2
CAPT BECAUSE FOCUSES ON

04:57:40.743 --> 04:57:44.046 region:rollup2
COMPARATIVE COST EFFECTIVENESS

04:57:42.778 --> 04:57:45.614 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN CLINICAL

04:57:44.046 --> 04:57:48.050 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVENESS.

04:57:45.614 --> 04:57:49.418 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS AND SERVICES SO.

04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:51.787 region:rollup2
PHILIP WE'RE GONNA BE LOSIN

04:57:49.418 --> 04:57:52.388 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF CARE TO.

04:57:51.787 --> 04:57:52.855 region:rollup2
MAKE UP FOR THAT ON THE OTHER

04:57:52.388 --> 04:57:54.957 region:rollup2
END.

04:57:52.855 --> 04:57:56.292 region:rollup2
.

04:57:54.957 --> 04:57:58.260 region:rollup2
IN IN OUR UNIVERSAL CARE.

04:57:56.292 --> 04:57:59.929 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WE LOOK AT OTHER

04:57:58.260 --> 04:58:01.797 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES

04:57:59.929 --> 04:58:03.466 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GOVERNMENT SET RATES

04:58:01.797 --> 04:58:05.301 region:rollup2
AND REGULATED PRICES BUT ALL THE

04:58:03.466 --> 04:58:07.536 region:rollup2
COSTS ROSE NO ONE WAS ABLE TO

04:58:05.301 --> 04:58:09.105 region:rollup2
GET A HANDLE ON REDUCING COSTS

04:58:07.536 --> 04:58:09.638 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

04:58:09.105 --> 04:58:10.506 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE ALL WOULD'VE

04:58:09.638 --> 04:58:12.441 region:rollup2
REALLY.

04:58:10.506 --> 04:58:15.811 region:rollup2
LOOK THAT CLOSER.

04:58:12.441 --> 04:58:17.079 region:rollup2
IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY BUT. YOU

04:58:15.811 --> 04:58:17.980 region:rollup2
KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE

04:58:17.079 --> 04:58:21.050 region:rollup2
OTHER.

RARE DISEASES IN EXETER. YOU

FOR THE UNDER SERVED WITH THE

04:58:25.588 --> 04:58:29.325 region:rollup2
QUALITY CARE NOT JUST THE BASE

04:58:27.757 --> 04:58:30.826 region:rollup2
CARE HOW DO WE GET NEW

04:58:29.325 --> 04:58:33.195 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS.

04:58:30.826 --> 04:58:35.164 region:rollup2
IN LIFE SCIENCE TO FOLKS IF

04:58:33.195 --> 04:58:36.699 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE CAPPED.

04:58:35.164 --> 04:58:37.233 region:rollup2
WHERE'S THE INCENTIVE FOR AN

04:58:36.699 --> 04:58:39.201 region:rollup2
INVASION INNOVATION IN OUR

04:58:37.233 --> 04:58:40.870 region:rollup2
STATE.

04:58:39.201 --> 04:58:41.504 region:rollup2
PERSONALIZE MEDICINE IS

04:58:40.870 --> 04:58:43.205 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK

04:58:41.504 --> 04:58:45.441 region:rollup2
AT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY IN

04:58:43.205 --> 04:58:46.909 region:rollup2
THE LONG TERM REDUCE COSTS IF WE

04:58:45.441 --> 04:58:48.711 region:rollup2
TREAT THE PATIENT THE RIGHT WAY.

04:58:46.909 --> 04:58:50.513 region:rollup2
AND MISS BURKE AND I HAVE A

04:58:48.711 --> 04:58:51.847 region:rollup2
BILL TALK UP BAKA GENETIC

04:58:50.513 --> 04:58:53.382 region:rollup2
TESTING I MEAN IF WE KNOW WHAT

04:58:51.847 --> 04:58:54.250 region:rollup2
WE'RE DEALING WITH IT'S CHEAPER

04:58:53.382 --> 04:58:55.918 region:rollup2
TO TREAT.

04:58:54.250 --> 04:58:57.853 region:rollup2
BUT INSTEAD OF BRINGING THE META

04:58:55.918 --> 04:58:58.921 region:rollup2
CHO UP WHICH A FEW OF US HAVE

04:58:57.853 --> 04:59:00.256 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT WE NEED TO IMPROVE

04:58:58.921 --> 04:59:02.625 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL.

04:59:00.256 --> 04:59:04.660 region:rollup2
AND THE RATE.

04:59:02.625 --> 04:59:06.395 region:rollup2
I FEEL THIS BILL IS BRINGING.

04:59:04.660 --> 04:59:10.733 region:rollup2
A COMMERCIAL CARE NOW.

04:59:06.395 --> 04:59:14.003 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S MY CLOSING STATEMENT.

04:59:10.733 --> 04:59:15.504 region:rollup2

OBSERVATION AND THIS HAS NOTHING

04:59:36.292 --> 04:59:38.427 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THE COMMITTEE BUT. I

04:59:37.660 --> 04:59:40.229 region:rollup2
REMEMBER SITTING IN THIS

04:59:38.427 --> 04:59:41.597 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ROOM FOR ABOUT FIVE OR

04:59:40.229 --> 04:59:43.833 region:rollup2
SIX HOURS.

04:59:41.597 --> 04:59:44.466 region:rollup2
WHEN MISTER BONTA WAS CHAIR.

04:59:43.833 --> 04:59:44.667 region:rollup2
AND WE DISCUSSED THE VACCINATION

04:59:44.466 --> 04:59:46.735 region:rollup2
BILL.

04:59:44.667 --> 04:59:49.338 region:rollup2
A.

04:59:46.735 --> 04:59:50.573 region:rollup2
I WISH WE GAVE THAT PERIOD OF A

04:59:49.338 --> 04:59:52.575 region:rollup2
TIME TO THIS BILL THIS'S

04:59:50.573 --> 04:59:53.876 region:rollup2
WHISPERED TALKING ABOUT CHANGING

04:59:52.575 --> 04:59:54.944 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THIS IS NO REFLECTION

04:59:53.876 --> 04:59:57.947 region:rollup2
TO THE CHAIR OF COURSE THIS IS

04:59:54.944 --> 04:59:59.715 region:rollup2
JUST. A COMMENTARY ON THE WAY WE

04:59:57.947 --> 05:00:01.817 region:rollup2
PROCESS THINGS HERE. WITH THIRTY

04:59:59.715 --> 05:00:03.652 region:rollup2
FOUR BILLS IN ONE NIGHT WHEN ONE

05:00:01.817 --> 05:00:05.554 region:rollup2
OF THEM MAKES SUCH A.

05:00:03.652 --> 05:00:06.755 region:rollup2
DRASTIC CHANGE IMPACT AND AND

05:00:05.554 --> 05:00:08.524 region:rollup2
AND AND INDUSTRY.

05:00:06.755 --> 05:00:10.059 region:rollup2
.

05:00:08.524 --> 05:00:11.360 region:rollup2
I THINK ONCE ITS OWN TIME.

05:00:10.059 --> 05:00:12.795 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN BEING FOCUS THAT

05:00:11.360 --> 05:00:14.663 region:rollup2
WITH A THIRTY THREE OTHERS.

05:00:12.795 --> 05:00:16.098 region:rollup2
SO.

05:00:14.663 --> 05:00:17.466 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF BASIC QUESTIONS AND

05:00:16.098 --> 05:00:18.667 region:rollup2
THEN A THIRD QUESTION OF

05:00:17.466 --> 05:00:20.636 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I HAVEN'T REALLY

05:00:18.667 --> 05:00:22.171 region:rollup2
HEARD BEING RAISED ABOUT. A AND

05:00:20.636 --> 05:00:23.606 region:rollup2
MAYBE I'M WRONG ON THIS BUT

05:00:22.171 --> 05:00:25.274 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL.

05:00:23.606 --> 05:00:27.042 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE

05:00:25.274 --> 05:00:29.945 region:rollup2
WITH THE OF THE LOSS FROM

05:00:27.042 --> 05:00:30.479 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS CAN YOU. PLEASE.

05:00:29.945 --> 05:00:32.448 region:rollup2
OFFER SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL

05:00:30.479 --> 05:00:34.116 region:rollup2
GIVEN.

05:00:32.448 --> 05:00:35.684 region:rollup2
THE TIME CRUNCH WE HAVE OF WHERE

05:00:34.116 --> 05:00:37.753 region:rollup2
DO YOU GET THAT I KEEP ON

05:00:35.684 --> 05:00:38.954 region:rollup2
HEARING THAT BUT I HAVEN'T.

05:00:37.753 --> 05:00:40.723 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HAPPY TWO AND IT'S VERY

05:00:38.954 --> 05:00:42.791 region:rollup2
SIMPLE IF I MAY USE THIS CHART

05:00:40.723 --> 05:00:43.859 region:rollup2
TO EXPLAIN. BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE

05:00:42.791 --> 05:00:46.328 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IS TAKING THAT

05:00:43.859 --> 05:00:47.696 region:rollup2
GRAYBAR PRIVATE INSURANCE THE

05:00:46.328 --> 05:00:50.666 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IS THE

05:00:47.696 --> 05:00:51.901 region:rollup2
IMPACT IF THE RATES WERE SET AT

05:00:50.666 --> 05:00:54.570 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

05:00:51.901 --> 05:00:55.971 region:rollup2
PERCENT. OF MEDICARE SO IT'S

05:00:54.570 --> 05:00:58.540 region:rollup2
VERY THIS IS ALL STATE DATA IT'S

05:00:55.971 --> 05:00:59.742 region:rollup2
VERY EASY FOR US TO MODEL. ONE

05:00:58.540 --> 05:01:01.477 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

05:00:59.742 --> 05:01:02.945 region:rollup2
OF THE MEDICARE RATES TODAY

05:01:01.477 --> 05:01:04.914 region:rollup2
WOULD BRING IT TO THAT RED LINE

05:01:02.945 --> 05:01:06.682 region:rollup2
SHOT SLIGHTLY ABOVE COST BECAUSE

05:01:04.914 --> 05:01:08.884 region:rollup2
MEDICARE. PAYS TWENTY THREE

05:01:06.682 --> 05:01:09.919 region:rollup2
PERCENT BELOW COST TODAY THREE

05:01:08.884 --> 05:01:11.086 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

05:01:09.919 --> 05:01:12.421 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IT'S BARELY BREAKING

05:01:11.086 --> 05:01:14.256 region:rollup2
EVEN THAT'S THE EIGHTEEN BILLION

05:01:12.421 --> 05:01:16.091 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. IF THEY WERE SET AT

05:01:14.256 --> 05:01:18.127 region:rollup2
MEDICARE RATES THE LOSSES WOULD

05:01:16.091 --> 05:01:19.762 region:rollup2
BE FAR GREATER. IF THEY WERE SET

05:01:18.127 --> 05:01:22.097 region:rollup2
AT HIGHER THAN A HUNDRED AND

05:01:19.762 --> 05:01:23.232 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF MEDICARE

05:01:22.097 --> 05:01:24.733 region:rollup2
THE LOSSES WOULD BE LESS.

05:01:23.232 --> 05:01:26.101 region:rollup2
BUT IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHETHER

05:01:24.733 --> 05:01:26.902 region:rollup2
THERE IS ANY COST CONTAINMENT

05:01:26.101 --> 05:01:28.571 region:rollup2
ANY PRICE SAVINGS.

05:01:26.902 --> 05:01:30.673 region:rollup2
GET.

05:01:28.571 --> 05:01:32.841 region:rollup2
I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU.

05:01:30.673 --> 05:01:34.843 region:rollup2
THAT OF MISTER COLOCAR KALRA BUT

05:01:32.841 --> 05:01:36.378 region:rollup2
JUSTANSWER THEN THEN THAT GOES

05:01:34.843 --> 05:01:37.746 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE ASSUMPTION OF THE.

05:01:36.378 --> 05:01:39.582 region:rollup2
IN THE FIRST EXAMPLE YOU GAVE OF

05:01:37.746 --> 05:01:41.250 region:rollup2
THE RESTAURANT WHERE YOU.

05:01:39.582 --> 05:01:42.952 region:rollup2
WE PAY A BILL AND THEN YOU

05:01:41.250 --> 05:01:44.520 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A BILL AND THEN YOU MAKE

05:01:42.952 --> 05:01:45.588 region:rollup2
A PAYMENT THAT'S NOT HAVE TO

05:01:44.520 --> 05:01:46.956 region:rollup2
SIGH HEFTY AMOUNT OF THE BILL.

05:01:45.588 --> 05:01:48.457 region:rollup2
WELL.

05:01:46.956 --> 05:01:49.491 region:rollup2
THAT ALL DUE RESPECT THAT

05:01:48.457 --> 05:01:50.459 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE DOESN'T REALLY APPLY

05:01:49.491 --> 05:01:52.227 region:rollup2
HERE BECAUSE.

05:01:50.459 --> 05:01:53.996 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:01:52.227 --> 05:01:55.531 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT THE PLAYERS DON'T

05:01:53.996 --> 05:01:56.765 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WALKING INTO.

05:01:55.531 --> 05:01:57.1000 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THE WHOLE IDEA IS

05:01:56.765 --> 05:02:00.235 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

05:01:57.1000 --> 05:02:00.869 region:rollup2
THE FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE COST

05:02:00.235 --> 05:02:03.172 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THE RESTAURANT IS GONNA

05:02:00.869 --> 05:02:06.375 region:rollup2
CHARGE IS ALREADY GONNA HAVE

05:02:03.172 --> 05:02:09.244 region:rollup2
ASSUMED THE LOWER PRICES.

05:02:06.375 --> 05:02:11.013 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PAIN.

05:02:09.244 --> 05:02:12.748 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT KIND OF THEN

05:02:11.013 --> 05:02:14.650 region:rollup2
ERODES THE ARGUMENT ON THIS

05:02:12.748 --> 05:02:16.852 region:rollup2
DOESN'T. MATTER YOU'RE TALKING

05:02:14.650 --> 05:02:18.220 region:rollup2
ABOUT. COSTS IF I MAY OFFER A

05:02:16.852 --> 05:02:20.322 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE A TO THE

05:02:18.220 --> 05:02:22.591 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED.

05:02:20.322 --> 05:02:24.560 region:rollup2
BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON. ON

05:02:22.591 --> 05:02:25.961 region:rollup2
THE COST OF CARE WHETHER THAT'S

05:02:24.560 --> 05:02:27.196 region:rollup2
FOR A VERY EXPENSIVE PEDIATRIC

05:02:25.961 --> 05:02:29.932 region:rollup2
CASE.

05:02:27.196 --> 05:02:31.467 region:rollup2
FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WITH CANCER.

05:02:29.932 --> 05:02:32.234 region:rollup2
FOR SOMEONE NAME BUT YOU KNOW

05:02:31.467 --> 05:02:34.203 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OTHER CONDITIONS THE

05:02:32.234 --> 05:02:36.472 region:rollup2
ACTUAL COST OF THAT CARE DOESN'T

05:02:34.203 --> 05:02:37.973 region:rollup2
CHANGE AT ALL. WHAT THIS BILL

05:02:36.472 --> 05:02:39.375 region:rollup2
DOES IS SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GONNA

05:02:37.973 --> 05:02:41.043 region:rollup2
DETERMINE HOW MUCH WE'RE GONNA

05:02:39.375 --> 05:02:43.012 region:rollup2
PAY YOU FOR THAT SERVICE?

05:02:41.043 --> 05:02:44.747 region:rollup2
SO THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES

05:02:43.012 --> 05:02:45.714 region:rollup2
AND THE SURGERY AND CHEMOTHERAPY

05:02:44.747 --> 05:02:47.750 region:rollup2
AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S A

05:02:45.714 --> 05:02:49.118 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT VISIT. IS STILL

05:02:47.750 --> 05:02:50.552 region:rollup2
THERE THE DRUGS ARE STILL GOING

05:02:49.118 --> 05:02:53.155 region:rollup2
UP A TEN POINT SIX PERCENT A

05:02:50.552 --> 05:02:54.657 region:rollup2
YEAR. ALL OF THE CLUSTER THERE

05:02:53.155 --> 05:02:57.126 region:rollup2
WERE SIMPLY SETTING HOW MUCH

05:02:54.657 --> 05:02:59.061 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PAID FOR THAT VISIT

05:02:57.126 --> 05:03:00.429 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE CHALLENGE AND

05:02:59.061 --> 05:03:02.197 region:rollup2
THE LOSSES AND THE CONCERN ABOUT

05:03:00.429 --> 05:03:04.433 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS LEAVING THE STATE.

05:03:02.197 --> 05:03:05.734 region:rollup2
AND HOSPITAL CLOSURES COMMIT.

05:03:04.433 --> 05:03:07.603 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA BEHIND THE

05:03:05.734 --> 05:03:09.938 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS A SET.

05:03:07.603 --> 05:03:10.572 region:rollup2
SET THE COST. SET THE PAYMENT

05:03:09.938 --> 05:03:12.307 region:rollup2
BASED ON WHAT THE COSTS ACTUALLY

05:03:10.572 --> 05:03:15.010 region:rollup2
ARE.

05:03:12.307 --> 05:03:16.612 region:rollup2
I IN SO BY PUTTING.

05:03:15.010 --> 05:03:18.147 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY A FICTITIOUS CHART UP

05:03:16.612 --> 05:03:20.149 region:rollup2
THERE AS TO WHAT BUT EVEN THOUGH

05:03:18.147 --> 05:03:21.316 region:rollup2
WE'VE SAID.

05:03:20.149 --> 05:03:22.351 region:rollup2
WE'VE SAID TIME AND AGAIN

05:03:21.316 --> 05:03:23.552 region:rollup2
THERE'S A ME FLEXIBILITY WITH

05:03:22.351 --> 05:03:24.620 region:rollup2
COMMISSION WHAT I MEAN BY

05:03:23.552 --> 05:03:26.288 region:rollup2
PETITIONS OF NO ONE OF SADNESS

05:03:24.620 --> 05:03:28.624 region:rollup2
AT HOW TO DRIVE SENT ACROSS THE

05:03:26.288 --> 05:03:29.391 region:rollup2
BOARD. DOES ALLOW THIS REPEATED

05:03:28.624 --> 05:03:30.526 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS

05:03:29.391 --> 05:03:31.694 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF YOU BY THE HOUSE TO

05:03:30.526 --> 05:03:32.928 region:rollup2
BE USED TIME AND AGAIN I'VE SEEN

05:03:31.694 --> 05:03:35.164 region:rollup2
DOZENS OF LETTERS WITH THAT

05:03:32.928 --> 05:03:36.565 region:rollup2
CLEARLY THE FOLKS ABOUT THOSE

05:03:35.164 --> 05:03:37.232 region:rollup2
LETTERS AND ACTUALLY THE BILL.

05:03:36.565 --> 05:03:38.801 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD A REALIZE NO

05:03:37.232 --> 05:03:39.835 region:rollup2
ONE IS SUGGESTING SETTING RATES

05:03:38.801 --> 05:03:41.503 region:rollup2
AT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

05:03:39.835 --> 05:03:43.172 region:rollup2
PERCENT AND IT ALSO DOESN'T

05:03:41.503 --> 05:03:44.873 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE DIFFERENT.

05:03:43.172 --> 05:03:46.942 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE

05:03:44.873 --> 05:03:49.611 region:rollup2
THAT HOSPITALS AND AND.

05:03:46.942 --> 05:03:52.347 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ACTUALLY SEE CLINTON

05:03:49.611 --> 05:03:54.483 region:rollup2
IN REAL TIME. AND SO. THAT'S WHY

05:03:52.347 --> 05:03:56.251 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE A

05:03:54.483 --> 05:03:58.053 region:rollup2
CHART ALTHOUGH I DO. UNDERSTAND

05:03:56.251 --> 05:04:00.622 region:rollup2
WHY BUT IN THOSE NUMBERS OUT

05:03:58.053 --> 05:04:02.224 region:rollup2
THERE AYE IS EASIER.

05:04:00.622 --> 05:04:02.825 region:rollup2
BUT THEN ACTUALLY.

05:04:02.224 --> 05:04:03.625 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHAT THE BILL DOES

05:04:02.825 --> 05:04:05.360 region:rollup2
AND DOES NOT.

05:04:03.625 --> 05:04:07.596 region:rollup2
IF I MAY THOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

05:04:05.360 --> 05:04:09.498 region:rollup2
IF THE BILL SPECIFIED THE NUMBER

05:04:07.596 --> 05:04:10.165 region:rollup2
WE COULD GIVE YOU AN EXACT.

05:04:09.498 --> 05:04:12.067 region:rollup2
NUMBER.

05:04:10.165 --> 05:04:13.135 region:rollup2
YOU NEED EARLY OFFERING OF THE

05:04:12.067 --> 05:04:14.570 region:rollup2
BILL HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT

05:04:13.135 --> 05:04:16.305 region:rollup2
MEDICARE IS WHAT WAS BEING

05:04:14.570 --> 05:04:18.474 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED THAT'S WHY WE MODELED

05:04:16.305 --> 05:04:20.209 region:rollup2
IT. IF THE BILL SPECIFICALLY

05:04:18.474 --> 05:04:22.344 region:rollup2
TELLS US WHAT PERCENT OF

05:04:20.209 --> 05:04:23.378 region:rollup2
MEDICARE WE COULD MODEL THAT.

05:04:22.344 --> 05:04:24.446 region:rollup2
AS WELL WOULD BE HAPPY THAT IS

05:04:23.378 --> 05:04:28.083 region:rollup2
NOT WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE

05:04:24.446 --> 05:04:29.718 region:rollup2
BILL WAS SIMPLY AS AN EFFORT TO.

05:04:28.083 --> 05:04:31.520 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE TO STAKEHOLDERS WHAT

05:04:29.718 --> 05:04:33.222 region:rollup2
THE WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE

05:04:31.520 --> 05:04:34.356 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS AND SAID HONEY

05:04:33.222 --> 05:04:36.358 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE COM HUNDRED KEEPER

05:04:34.356 --> 05:04:37.626 region:rollup2
SENT DOT DOT DOT. THEY TOOK

05:04:36.358 --> 05:04:38.727 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

05:04:37.626 --> 05:04:40.996 region:rollup2
THE US WERE SAYING WAS GONNA

05:04:38.727 --> 05:04:43.065 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IT'S FALSE. I UNDERSTAND

05:04:40.996 --> 05:04:46.135 region:rollup2
WHY THEY'RE BEING SOME DESIRE

05:04:43.065 --> 05:04:47.669 region:rollup2
FOR FOR. THE CONFUSION CREATED

05:04:46.135 --> 05:04:49.738 region:rollup2
HERE OFTENTIMES IS INTENTIONAL.

05:04:47.669 --> 05:04:50.572 region:rollup2
ARM THAT IS NOT WHAT WE EVER

05:04:49.738 --> 05:04:51.507 region:rollup2
SUGGESTED

05:04:50.572 --> 05:04:52.941 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING

05:04:51.507 --> 05:04:54.176 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT HELPFUL.

05:04:52.941 --> 05:04:55.511 region:rollup2
THE CONVERSATION AND WE'RE NOT

05:04:54.176 --> 05:04:56.545 region:rollup2
GOING TO GIVE A NUMBER BECAUSE

05:04:55.511 --> 05:04:58.413 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT THIS BILL DOES NOT SET

05:04:56.545 --> 05:04:59.915 region:rollup2
A NUMBER.

05:04:58.413 --> 05:05:01.683 region:rollup2
IF WE DID IDIOT WHOLLY DIFFERENT

05:04:59.915 --> 05:05:03.018 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND I THINK TO BE

05:05:01.683 --> 05:05:04.186 region:rollup2
SOME MERIT DARDEN'S ME MADE

05:05:03.018 --> 05:05:06.655 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION IF THAT'S WHAT THIS

05:05:04.186 --> 05:05:07.289 region:rollup2
BILL ACTUALLY DID IT'S JUST THAT

05:05:06.655 --> 05:05:07.556 region:rollup2
HAVE US IS THAT IS THAT IS THAT

05:05:07.289 --> 05:05:08.790 region:rollup2
A NUMBER.

05:05:07.556 --> 05:05:10.692 region:rollup2
VOTER RESPECT

05:05:08.790 --> 05:05:11.260 region:rollup2
NOT A COUNTERPOINT COUNTERPOINT

05:05:10.692 --> 05:05:12.494 region:rollup2
HERE IT'S NOT SIXTY MINUTES

05:05:11.260 --> 05:05:15.030 region:rollup2
TODAY.

05:05:12.494 --> 05:05:18.133 region:rollup2
BUT BUT JUST PLEASE ADDRESS THE

05:05:15.030 --> 05:05:19.268 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

05:05:18.133 --> 05:05:21.003 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I IDEA

DON'T OF PAIRS OF REPRESENTATIVE

05:05:26.775 --> 05:05:30.112 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO. AT LEAST SPEAK TO

05:05:28.810 --> 05:05:32.981 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS.

05:05:30.112 --> 05:05:33.515 region:rollup2
IF MISTER CHAIR YOU.

05:05:33.515 --> 05:05:37.352 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES.

COUPLE MINUTES HERE.

05:05:37.352 --> 05:05:48.030 region:rollup2
AND AND NO PRESSURE TERESA.

05:05:47.396 --> 05:05:48.831 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER IS

05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:51.567 region:rollup2
THERE AND.

05:05:48.831 --> 05:05:53.335 region:rollup2
WE DID SEND IN AN OPPOSE LETTER.

05:05:51.567 --> 05:05:55.070 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

05:05:53.335 --> 05:05:56.672 region:rollup2
WITH THE BILL FRANKLY FOR. ALL

05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:57.739 region:rollup2
THE REASONS YOU YOU HAVE HEARD

05:05:56.672 --> 05:06:00.008 region:rollup2
ABOUT TODAY.

05:05:57.739 --> 05:06:01.243 region:rollup2
JUST IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON

05:06:00.008 --> 05:06:01.910 region:rollup2
OUR OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM.

05:06:01.243 --> 05:06:03.879 region:rollup2
.

05:06:01.910 --> 05:06:05.447 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT.

05:06:03.879 --> 05:06:06.615 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THEY

05:06:05.447 --> 05:06:07.950 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT WOULD BE IN TERMS OF

05:06:06.615 --> 05:06:10.185 region:rollup2
MONEY BEING REMOVED FROM THE

05:06:07.950 --> 05:06:11.887 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BUT. WE HAVE THIRTY SIX

05:06:10.185 --> 05:06:12.988 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA AND.

05:06:11.887 --> 05:06:15.257 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED MEDICAL OFFICE

05:06:12.988 --> 05:06:16.792 region:rollup2
BUILDINGS AND WE I WORK WITH OUR

05:06:15.257 --> 05:06:18.894 region:rollup2
MEDICAL GROUPS TWELVE THOUSAND

05:06:16.792 --> 05:06:20.929 region:rollup2
POSITIONS AND SO IT WOULD HAVE.

05:06:18.894 --> 05:06:22.631 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR

05:06:20.929 --> 05:06:23.932 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO RUN OUR INTEGRATED

05:06:22.631 --> 05:06:25.801 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEM SOUP MORE

05:06:23.932 --> 05:06:27.903 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY SINCE YOU ARE AN

05:06:25.801 --> 05:06:29.238 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SYSTEM.

05:06:27.903 --> 05:06:31.039 region:rollup2
CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT

05:06:29.238 --> 05:06:32.507 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE

05:06:31.039 --> 05:06:33.609 region:rollup2
IMPACT WOULD BE BECAUSE I THINK

05:06:32.507 --> 05:06:35.611 region:rollup2
THERE WERE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

05:06:33.609 --> 05:06:37.112 region:rollup2
TAKEN TO CLARIFY THAT THE BILL

05:06:35.611 --> 05:06:38.680 region:rollup2
IS NOT INTENDED TO IMPACT

05:06:37.112 --> 05:06:40.315 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED RATES.

05:06:38.680 --> 05:06:42.384 region:rollup2
SO THE CAPITATED RATE THAT WE

05:06:40.315 --> 05:06:45.420 region:rollup2
PAY ARE DELEGATED MEDICAL GROUP

05:06:42.384 --> 05:06:47.623 region:rollup2
THIS SPONSORS ARE. NODDING BUT.

05:06:45.420 --> 05:06:49.424 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD BE SET

05:06:47.623 --> 05:06:51.260 region:rollup2
WOULD BE PAID ARRAY BASED ON

05:06:49.424 --> 05:06:53.595 region:rollup2
MEDICARE ADVANTAGE.

05:06:51.260 --> 05:06:56.531 region:rollup2
SO. WE WOULD STILL BE EXPECTED

05:06:53.595 --> 05:06:58.667 region:rollup2
TO RUN OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM.

05:06:56.531 --> 05:06:59.201 region:rollup2
WITH A RATE THAT WOULD BE VERY

05:06:58.667 --> 05:07:01.136 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE GET

05:06:59.201 --> 05:07:03.071 region:rollup2
TODAY.

05:07:01.136 --> 05:07:05.073 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THEY'RE NOT INTENDING

05:07:03.071 --> 05:07:06.875 region:rollup2
TO IMPACT THE CONTRACTED RATES.

05:07:05.073 --> 05:07:08.410 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES SENSE BECAUSE THAT.

05:07:06.875 --> 05:07:09.912 region:rollup2
REALLY IS SORT OF RATE SETTING

05:07:08.410 --> 05:07:12.014 region:rollup2
IT'S AGREED TO BETWEEN THE PAIR

05:07:09.912 --> 05:07:14.249 region:rollup2
IN THE PROVIDER AND THAT'S HOW

05:07:12.014 --> 05:07:16.952 region:rollup2
YOU GET TO VALUE. AND. YOU KNOW

05:07:14.249 --> 05:07:17.586 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES PERFORMANCE SPACE CARE

05:07:16.952 --> 05:07:20.489 region:rollup2
WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT TO

05:07:17.586 --> 05:07:21.790 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE. BUT IF YOU.

05:07:20.489 --> 05:07:24.726 region:rollup2
THEORETICALLY LOWER WHAT WE'RE

05:07:21.790 --> 05:07:25.794 region:rollup2
GETTING DIDN'T AS THE PAIR.

05:07:24.726 --> 05:07:29.498 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S LESS MONEY IN THE

05:07:25.794 --> 05:07:32.134 region:rollup2
SYSTEM FOR EVERYTHING ELSE.

05:07:29.498 --> 05:07:35.237 region:rollup2
THANK.

05:07:32.134 --> 05:07:37.472 region:rollup2
OKAY.

05:07:35.237 --> 05:07:45.347 region:rollup2
BUT ONCE OF.

05:07:37.472 --> 05:07:45.914 region:rollup2
LIKE YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I.

05:07:45.347 --> 05:07:47.683 region:rollup2
WE GOT THAT WERE SHAKING HER

05:07:45.914 --> 05:07:48.884 region:rollup2
HEAD TO GET WELL GIVEN WHAT I'M

05:07:47.683 --> 05:07:51.586 region:rollup2
HEARING THOUGH IT FOR FIRST OF

05:07:48.884 --> 05:07:53.088 region:rollup2
ALL IF IF YOU DON'T TRY TO TAKE

05:07:51.586 --> 05:07:54.790 region:rollup2
A CERTAIN STEP AND.

05:07:53.088 --> 05:07:56.992 region:rollup2
IN IN IN ADDRESSING AN ISSUE

05:07:54.790 --> 05:07:58.193 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MOVE.

05:07:56.992 --> 05:07:59.828 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF

05:07:58.193 --> 05:08:02.264 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M HEARING RIGHT NOW AND

05:07:59.828 --> 05:08:02.764 region:rollup2
WHAT WE USUALLY HERE. IS JUST

05:08:02.264 --> 05:08:04.700 region:rollup2
THE NEGATIVES OF WHAT'S

05:08:02.764 --> 05:08:05.834 region:rollup2
SOMETHING.

05:08:04.700 --> 05:08:07.369 region:rollup2
OF OF HOW SOMETHING IS NOT GOING

05:08:05.834 --> 05:08:09.071 region:rollup2
TO WORK.

05:08:07.369 --> 05:08:12.174 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

05:08:09.071 --> 05:08:14.276 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN MAKE SOMETHING WORK.

05:08:12.174 --> 05:08:16.578 region:rollup2
I'M NOT WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS

05:08:14.276 --> 05:08:17.646 region:rollup2
BILL TODAY BECAUSE. OF AND I

05:08:16.578 --> 05:08:19.247 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO ELABORATE ON JUST

05:08:17.646 --> 05:08:21.750 region:rollup2
THE NEGATIVES.

05:08:19.247 --> 05:08:23.685 region:rollup2
I THINK IF IF THERE IS A BODY

05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:25.787 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMMISSION TO LOOK AT

05:08:23.685 --> 05:08:28.623 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FULL TIME.

05:08:25.787 --> 05:08:30.025 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT.

05:08:28.623 --> 05:08:31.526 region:rollup2
FAR OUT OF REACH THAT IT CAN

05:08:30.025 --> 05:08:33.362 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY TRIED TO ADDRESS

05:08:31.526 --> 05:08:35.697 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE ISSUES.

05:08:33.362 --> 05:08:37.165 region:rollup2
AND IT CAN'T BE MORE CHALLENGING

05:08:35.697 --> 05:08:39.301 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING

05:08:37.165 --> 05:08:40.635 region:rollup2
WITH RIGHT NOW WHEN.

05:08:39.301 --> 05:08:42.771 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE A LOT OF THE

05:08:40.635 --> 05:08:46.575 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS ARE. COMPROMISED TO

05:08:42.771 --> 05:08:48.210 region:rollup2
THE POINT WHERE IT BECOMES.

05:08:46.575 --> 05:08:49.578 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE OR. ALICE

05:08:48.210 --> 05:08:51.780 region:rollup2
MARGINAL OF IMPACT.

05:08:49.578 --> 05:08:53.181 region:rollup2
.

05:08:51.780 --> 05:08:55.183 region:rollup2
BUT WILL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

05:08:53.181 --> 05:08:57.285 region:rollup2
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT WAS MORE

05:08:55.183 --> 05:08:59.554 region:rollup2
OF JUST THE ACCOUNTABILITY.

05:08:57.285 --> 05:09:01.957 region:rollup2
OF OF THIS COMMISSION.

05:08:59.554 --> 05:09:03.225 region:rollup2
AT WHAT WHEN YOU ESTABLISH IT.

05:09:01.957 --> 05:09:03.992 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT VOTING FOR THESE

05:09:03.225 --> 05:09:05.827 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THESE ARE SELECTED

05:09:03.992 --> 05:09:05.994 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS.

05:09:05.827 --> 05:09:08.230 region:rollup2
SO.

05:09:05.994 --> 05:09:10.399 region:rollup2
.

05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:12.634 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE PRESSURES THAT WILL

05:09:10.399 --> 05:09:13.802 region:rollup2
FORCE UP?

05:09:12.634 --> 05:09:16.638 region:rollup2
FORCE UPON THIS BODY.

05:09:13.802 --> 05:09:18.673 region:rollup2
TELL.

05:09:16.638 --> 05:09:21.243 region:rollup2
HOW IT MAKES DECISIONS AND HOW

05:09:18.673 --> 05:09:24.513 region:rollup2
IT MANEUVERS AND HOW?

05:09:21.243 --> 05:09:26.081 region:rollup2
A IT RESPONDS MOST. IMPORTANTLY.

05:09:24.513 --> 05:09:27.449 region:rollup2
VIDEO IS THIS SOMETHING THAT

05:09:26.081 --> 05:09:28.383 region:rollup2
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF IT WAS

05:09:27.449 --> 05:09:29.918 region:rollup2
UNDER THE.

05:09:28.383 --> 05:09:32.020 region:rollup2
INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS.

05:09:29.918 --> 05:09:33.789 region:rollup2
A DEPARTMENT SO THAT THERE IS A

05:09:32.020 --> 05:09:36.391 region:rollup2
POLITICAL ENTITY WHO GETS

05:09:33.789 --> 05:09:39.795 region:rollup2
ELECTED STATEWIDE WHO THEN. IS

05:09:36.391 --> 05:09:40.462 region:rollup2
MORE ACCOUNTABLE LIKE. THAT I'M.

05:09:39.795 --> 05:09:41.897 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT THIS THROUGH I

05:09:40.462 --> 05:09:43.765 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO SUGGEST THAT ONLY

05:09:41.897 --> 05:09:44.933 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I FELT THAT THERE NEEDS

05:09:43.765 --> 05:09:46.635 region:rollup2
TO BE A GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY

05:09:44.933 --> 05:09:48.170 region:rollup2
ON THIS BODY.

05:09:46.635 --> 05:09:49.738 region:rollup2
SURE YEAH AND MISS SHARE OF A

05:09:48.170 --> 05:09:51.339 region:rollup2
GOOD I I APPRECIATE THAT

05:09:49.738 --> 05:09:51.873 region:rollup2
CONCERNED I THINK THAT THE KEY

05:09:51.339 --> 05:09:53.575 region:rollup2
IS TO MAKE AS TO THAT MUCH

05:09:51.873 --> 05:09:54.976 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT. I DO NOT HAVE

05:09:53.575 --> 05:09:56.445 region:rollup2
SIMPLY HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS ON

05:09:54.976 --> 05:09:57.813 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE WE SEE WHAT'S

05:09:56.445 --> 05:09:59.948 region:rollup2
HAPPENED IN OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM

05:09:57.813 --> 05:10:01.249 region:rollup2
AND AND. IT IN HOW ELECTIONS ARE

05:09:59.948 --> 05:10:02.350 region:rollup2
WON AND LOST IF YOU HAVE A JUST

05:10:01.249 --> 05:10:02.951 region:rollup2
UNDER THE INSURANCE COMMISSION

05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:05.287 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ONE

05:10:02.951 --> 05:10:06.388 region:rollup2
ELECTED INDIVIDUAL. THAT WOULD

05:10:05.287 --> 05:10:07.222 region:rollup2
HAVE ALL THAT POWER.

05:10:06.388 --> 05:10:09.057 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY THE THOUGH THE

05:10:07.222 --> 05:10:10.992 region:rollup2
APPOINTEES ARE SELECTED FROM

05:10:09.057 --> 05:10:13.962 region:rollup2

05:10:30.212 --> 05:10:32.247 region:rollup2

OTHER COMMISSIONS OF THE STATE

05:11:01.109 --> 05:11:03.745 region:rollup2

THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I I

05:11:13.421 --> 05:11:15.423 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

05:11:14.523 --> 05:11:16.391 region:rollup2
I WAS LOOKING FOR ONLY BECAUSE

05:11:15.423 --> 05:11:18.293 region:rollup2

NEED TO. BE MINDFUL OF AND WORK

05:11:35.076 --> 05:11:38.146 region:rollup2

WE HAVE.

05:12:04.272 --> 05:12:08.777 region:rollup2
UNSUSTAINABLE ESCALATING COSTS

IN THE NECK WITH A LITTLE OF

05:12:16.551 --> 05:12:18.153 region:rollup2
THIS WILL HAPPEN TO ME IN THE

05:12:17.152 --> 05:12:19.621 region:rollup2
NEXT.

HMO EXECUTIVE BUT I WILL RUN

05:12:30.599 --> 05:12:34.669 region:rollup2
INTO A DOCTOR.

05:12:33.034 --> 05:12:35.904 region:rollup2
PROBABLY A FAMILY DOCTOR AND

05:12:34.669 --> 05:12:37.939 region:rollup2
THEY'LL BE UNEASY ABOUT THE

05:12:35.904 --> 05:12:40.575 region:rollup2
SQUEEZE.

05:12:37.939 --> 05:12:42.577 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL.

05:12:40.575 --> 05:12:44.546 region:rollup2
POSITIONS OUT THERE.

WITH THAT.

05:12:44.546 --> 05:12:47.649 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT BE

05:12:45.714 --> 05:12:48.917 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS NAY MAIM NAY MAYBE

05:12:47.649 --> 05:12:49.985 region:rollup2
APPETITE AS SOON THAT MAYBE THEY

05:12:48.917 --> 05:12:52.687 region:rollup2
DON'T PUTS BUT THEY'RE GOING TO

05:12:49.985 --> 05:12:53.154 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT THIS WILL SQUEEZE.

05:12:52.687 --> 05:12:54.656 region:rollup2
THE AVERAGE DOCTOR IN

05:12:53.154 --> 05:12:56.758 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

05:12:54.656 --> 05:12:56.925 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?

05:12:56.758 --> 05:12:58.526 region:rollup2
TO.

05:12:56.925 --> 05:13:00.862 region:rollup2
TO ATTEMPT TO SATISFY THEIR

05:12:58.526 --> 05:13:02.597 region:rollup2
KIDS.

05:13:00.862 --> 05:13:03.865 region:rollup2
WHY WAS START BY SAYING THAT?

05:13:02.597 --> 05:13:05.800 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL IS NOT INTENDED

05:13:03.865 --> 05:13:06.401 region:rollup2
TO SQUEEZE.

05:13:05.800 --> 05:13:07.902 region:rollup2
DAM.

05:13:06.401 --> 05:13:09.404 region:rollup2
BUT THE BALLY PRACTITIONERS ARE

05:13:07.902 --> 05:13:10.405 region:rollup2
ANY DOCTOR FOR THAT MATTER BUT

05:13:09.404 --> 05:13:11.439 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU'RE RAISING THE ISSUE

05:13:10.405 --> 05:13:12.841 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AND I UNDERSTAND

05:13:11.439 --> 05:13:14.109 region:rollup2
WHY FAMILY PRACTITIONERS SOLO

05:13:12.841 --> 05:13:15.143 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS.

05:13:14.109 --> 05:13:17.112 region:rollup2
OTHER ALREADY FEELING SQUEEZE

05:13:15.143 --> 05:13:19.381 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW WITH GRINS.

05:13:17.112 --> 05:13:19.681 region:rollup2
AND UP IN MANY CASES THEY'RE

05:13:19.381 --> 05:13:21.883 region:rollup2
UNDERPAID.

05:13:19.681 --> 05:13:23.051 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THIS BILL

05:13:21.883 --> 05:13:23.852 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

05:13:23.051 --> 05:13:25.654 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAY THEM WHAT THEY

05:13:23.852 --> 05:13:27.355 region:rollup2
DESERVE. ALLOW THE COMMERCIAL

05:13:25.654 --> 05:13:28.623 region:rollup2
RATES THEY DON'T RESPECT US ALL

05:13:27.355 --> 05:13:30.592 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS WHAT LEVERAGE THEY

05:13:28.623 --> 05:13:30.959 region:rollup2
HAVE RIGHT NOW. TO INCREASE THE

05:13:30.592 --> 05:13:32.293 region:rollup2
RACE THEY GET.

05:13:30.959 --> 05:13:33.728 region:rollup2
VERY LITTLE.

05:13:32.293 --> 05:13:35.263 region:rollup2
THIS WILL ACTUALLY GIVE THEM THE

IN ORDER TO BUILD A PIPELINE

05:14:00.055 --> 05:14:02.857 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT. TO

05:14:01.990 --> 05:14:04.359 region:rollup2
ANY INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR NOT

05:14:02.857 --> 05:14:04.893 region:rollup2

THEM THAT HAVE CALLED ME

05:14:04.893 --> 05:14:07.996 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY AND TALKING ABOUT

THIS BILL TALKED MY STAFF ABOUT

05:14:07.996 --> 05:14:11.333 region:rollup2
THIS BILL. EYES OTHERS DOES NOT

05:14:10.298 --> 05:14:12.767 region:rollup2
ABOUT TARGETING DOCTORS

05:14:11.333 --> 05:14:14.336 region:rollup2
THERE'S AND AND THAT WE WANT

05:14:12.767 --> 05:14:15.737 region:rollup2
DOCTORS OTHER DOCTORS AND

05:14:14.336 --> 05:14:17.806 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS I DO

MOST SERVICE. I TO GET PAID.

05:14:17.806 --> 05:14:20.642 region:rollup2
IN AND TO GET THE RESOURCES

05:14:19.541 --> 05:14:21.910 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO CONTINUE IN

05:14:20.642 --> 05:14:23.411 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

05:14:21.910 --> 05:14:26.181 region:rollup2
THERE'S A YOUNG DOCTOR.

05:14:23.411 --> 05:14:27.916 region:rollup2
THEY NOT ONLY HAVE TO CONSIDER.

05:14:26.181 --> 05:14:29.017 region:rollup2
THEIR PRACTICE FOR THE NEXT

05:14:27.916 --> 05:14:30.051 region:rollup2
FOUR FIVE YEARS BUT THAT IT THE

05:14:29.017 --> 05:14:31.653 region:rollup2
NEXT HOPEFULLY THIRTY FORTY PLUS

05:14:30.051 --> 05:14:33.221 region:rollup2
YEARS.

05:14:31.653 --> 05:14:35.056 region:rollup2
AND SO THE SYSTEMS UNSUSTAINABLE

05:14:33.221 --> 05:14:36.091 region:rollup2
DOES A BENEFIT THEM AND THE WAY

05:14:35.056 --> 05:14:37.525 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN GOING

05:14:36.091 --> 05:14:38.727 region:rollup2
AS WE EVEN HEARD FROM MISTER

05:14:37.525 --> 05:14:39.694 region:rollup2
BIGELOW LOT OF PRACTICE ARE

05:14:38.727 --> 05:14:40.962 region:rollup2
CLOSING DOWN BUT THE CURRENT

05:14:39.694 --> 05:14:42.230 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

05:14:40.962 --> 05:14:43.298 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:44.466 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TO CREATE A SYSTEM

05:14:43.298 --> 05:14:46.434 region:rollup2
THAT SUSTAINABLE AND THAT

05:14:44.466 --> 05:14:47.936 region:rollup2
INCLUDES ENSURING IT SUSTAINABLE

05:14:46.434 --> 05:14:50.405 region:rollup2

DEDICATE THEIR TIME TO THE

05:14:59.280 --> 05:15:03.685 region:rollup2
UNION?

05:15:01.182 --> 05:15:04.919 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A A BIT OF GOOD

05:15:03.685 --> 05:15:06.688 region:rollup2
NEWS IN THIS PICTURE.

05:15:04.919 --> 05:15:09.424 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA RANKS FIRST IN THE

05:15:06.688 --> 05:15:10.024 region:rollup2
NATION FOR PERCENTAGES OF BOTH

05:15:09.424 --> 05:15:10.859 region:rollup2
MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS

05:15:10.859 --> 05:15:13.061 region:rollup2
CHOOSE TO REMAIN IN THE STATE.

05:15:12.594 --> 05:15:15.196 region:rollup2
AND.

05:15:13.061 --> 05:15:17.232 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL CERTAINLY IS NOT TO

05:15:15.196 --> 05:15:19.267 region:rollup2
SEE THEM OF LEAVE.

05:15:17.232 --> 05:15:22.437 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WILL

05:15:19.267 --> 05:15:24.539 region:rollup2
POINT OUT YOU TO IS KIND OF AT A

05:15:22.437 --> 05:15:26.441 region:rollup2
POINT IN HISTORY WHEN. UP PRIOR

05:15:24.539 --> 05:15:28.743 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PASSED NURSE

05:15:26.441 --> 05:15:31.679 region:rollup2
STAFFING RATIOS CALIFORNIA WAS

05:15:28.743 --> 05:15:35.416 region:rollup2
UNDER A TERRIBLE NURSE AS

05:15:31.679 --> 05:15:37.018 region:rollup2
NURSING SHORTAGE. AND THE RATIOS

05:15:35.416 --> 05:15:38.787 region:rollup2
HELPED TO.

05:15:37.018 --> 05:15:40.789 region:rollup2
COMPEL.

05:15:38.787 --> 05:15:42.657 region:rollup2
DOES THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR GRAY

05:15:40.789 --> 05:15:44.692 region:rollup2

TRAINING AND EDUCATION. WE HAVE

05:15:50.431 --> 05:15:53.468 region:rollup2
ERASE THE NURSING SHORTAGE IN

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A

05:15:53.468 --> 05:15:57.872 region:rollup2
RESULT AND I DO THINK THAT ONE

05:15:55.904 --> 05:15:59.941 region:rollup2
OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN GET TO

05:15:57.872 --> 05:16:01.576 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ON

05:15:59.941 --> 05:16:01.976 region:rollup2

IS BY.

05:16:04.312 --> 05:16:08.249 region:rollup2
CREATING A SIGNIFICANT POLICY

05:16:06.448 --> 05:16:10.685 region:rollup2
CHANGE BECAUSE ITIT'S BEEN FAR

05:16:08.249 --> 05:16:11.886 region:rollup2
TOO LONG SINCE WE'VE SEEN A REAL

05:16:10.685 --> 05:16:12.954 region:rollup2

A FOLLOW UP LOS

05:16:17.025 --> 05:16:19.694 region:rollup2
YOU KALRA I KNOW THAT THAT.

05:16:18.593 --> 05:16:21.629 region:rollup2
CHANGES HARD TO THIS IS WHAT

YOU'RE PROPOSING IN THE GET

05:16:21.629 --> 05:16:24.966 region:rollup2
CHANGES PRODUCT TO CANCEL.

CERTAIN OF THE DEVICE.

05:16:26.768 --> 05:16:30.004 region:rollup2
TERRIBLE THINGS CAN HAPPEN.

05:16:28.736 --> 05:16:32.373 region:rollup2
THE OTHER CAMP IS CAUTIOUSLY

05:16:30.004 --> 05:16:33.007 region:rollup2
OPTIMISTIC.

05:16:32.373 --> 05:16:34.375 region:rollup2
ON THE UPSIDE IT'S MY CHANGES SO

05:16:33.007 --> 05:16:36.044 region:rollup2

SO ARE YOU ARE YOU.

MAKE A STRAIGHT FACE THAT A

05:16:40.915 --> 05:16:44.752 region:rollup2
GREAT NUMBER OF DOCTORS WOULD

05:16:42.550 --> 05:16:46.621 region:rollup2
BUT HAVE THEIR SITUATIONS. ARE

05:16:44.752 --> 05:16:48.022 region:rollup2
INCREASE AS FAR AS THAT THAT

05:16:46.621 --> 05:16:48.556 region:rollup2
THAT THE FINANCIAL WHEREWITHAL

05:16:48.022 --> 05:16:50.091 region:rollup2

THAT BY.

05:16:50.091 --> 05:16:53.561 region:rollup2
MAKING SOME ADJUSTMENTS AT THE

05:16:52.193 --> 05:16:56.097 region:rollup2
ENDS THAT THAT WHOLE OVER ALL

05:16:53.561 --> 05:16:57.198 region:rollup2
THAT MANY THAT MORE THAN. FIFTY

05:16:56.097 --> 05:16:58.867 region:rollup2

THAT'S OUR GOAL.

05:17:05.106 --> 05:17:09.377 region:rollup2
OUR GOAL IS TO DO THAT BECAUSE

05:17:07.175 --> 05:17:10.411 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT THEIR PLENTY. OF

05:17:09.377 --> 05:17:11.579 region:rollup2

SUSTAINABLE.

05:17:19.921 --> 05:17:24.626 region:rollup2
AS AS MUCH AS IT IS TO MAKE.

05:17:22.657 --> 05:17:25.226 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES

05:17:24.626 --> 05:17:29.330 region:rollup2
AND PROFOUNDLY SUSTAINABLE AS

05:17:25.226 --> 05:17:32.300 region:rollup2
WELL.

05:17:29.330 --> 05:17:33.835 region:rollup2

A WAY TO CONTAIN A. REDUCE ITS

05:17:59.160 --> 05:18:01.963 region:rollup2

05:18:59.654 --> 05:19:02.490 region:rollup2
REDID IT DID LOOK LIKE IT'S

05:19:01.089 --> 05:19:04.525 region:rollup2
TARGETING PROVIDERS.

05:19:02.490 --> 05:19:06.661 region:rollup2
AND AND.

05:19:04.525 --> 05:19:09.430 region:rollup2
AND. I WAS IN A PHILOSOPHICAL.

05:19:06.661 --> 05:19:10.264 region:rollup2
.-THE LIMIT HERE BECAUSE FOR THE

05:19:09.430 --> 05:19:11.1000 region:rollup2
SAME REASON THAT I WANT TO

05:19:10.264 --> 05:19:13.468 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE NURSE.

05:19:11.1000 --> 05:19:14.435 region:rollup2
NURSES WAIT FOR THE SAME REASON

05:19:13.468 --> 05:19:16.104 region:rollup2
I WANT PROTECT A JANITOR'S WHAT

05:19:14.435 --> 05:19:17.338 region:rollup2
WAGE INCREASE AND FOR THE SAME

05:19:16.104 --> 05:19:18.840 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT I WANT. A

05:19:17.338 --> 05:19:20.508 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION TRADES.

05:19:18.840 --> 05:19:22.210 region:rollup2
EMPLOYED TO INCREASE HIS OR HER

05:19:20.508 --> 05:19:23.811 region:rollup2
WAGE

05:19:22.210 --> 05:19:25.213 region:rollup2
IS THE SAME REASON NOW

05:19:23.811 --> 05:19:26.681 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHIC THAT I HAVE TO BE

05:19:25.213 --> 05:19:27.782 region:rollup2
CHALLENGED TO.

05:19:26.681 --> 05:19:28.916 region:rollup2
ALLOW SOMEBODY TO DO THE BEST

05:19:27.782 --> 05:19:31.285 region:rollup2
THEY POSSIBLY CAN.

05:19:28.916 --> 05:19:33.521 region:rollup2
IN THE MARKETPLACE.

05:19:31.285 --> 05:19:35.323 region:rollup2
I DO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE

05:19:33.521 --> 05:19:38.693 region:rollup2
ARE SOME.

05:19:35.323 --> 05:19:40.795 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD CALLS THROUGH SOME.

05:19:38.693 --> 05:19:42.397 region:rollup2
EXAGGERATED COST OR OR REAL HIGH

05:19:40.795 --> 05:19:44.132 region:rollup2
COST.

05:19:42.397 --> 05:19:46.134 region:rollup2
I MEAN CERTAINLY EARNED IS

05:19:44.132 --> 05:19:48.269 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY IN THE SPECIALTIES.

05:19:46.134 --> 05:19:48.736 region:rollup2
SPECIAL SPECIAL PROCEDURES

05:19:48.269 --> 05:19:50.138 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AN UNPLANNED

05:19:48.736 --> 05:19:52.273 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES.

05:19:50.138 --> 05:19:54.742 region:rollup2
I KNOW WHICH BUT THIS IS THE

05:19:52.273 --> 05:19:55.276 region:rollup2
DILEMMA THAT I MEAN.

05:19:54.742 --> 05:19:56.644 region:rollup2
I WAS ALSO LITTLE BIT HARD

05:19:55.276 --> 05:19:58.279 region:rollup2
PRESSED.

05:19:56.644 --> 05:19:59.380 region:rollup2
COULD BECAUSE SEVERAL YEARS AGO

05:19:58.279 --> 05:20:01.349 region:rollup2
I POSED A BILL THAT HAD A

05:19:59.380 --> 05:20:02.383 region:rollup2
SIMILAR PARADISE. AND I THINK

05:20:01.349 --> 05:20:03.584 region:rollup2
IT'S A BUT A BILL THAT MISTER

05:20:02.383 --> 05:20:05.253 region:rollup2
BONTA CARRIED.

05:20:03.584 --> 05:20:07.188 region:rollup2
I HOPE I GET THE NUMBER RIGHT.

05:20:05.253 --> 05:20:09.357 region:rollup2
AB THREE FIVE FIVE.

05:20:07.188 --> 05:20:10.224 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DID CITY FLOOR IN

05:20:09.357 --> 05:20:12.060 region:rollup2
THE DID TALK ABOUT GOING TO A

05:20:10.224 --> 05:20:14.996 region:rollup2
PANEL.

05:20:12.060 --> 05:20:16.698 region:rollup2
AND IDEA AT THAT POINT AT THAT

05:20:14.996 --> 05:20:17.331 region:rollup2
POINT HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT.

05:20:16.698 --> 05:20:18.833 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS

05:20:17.331 --> 05:20:20.101 region:rollup2
FEASIBLE.

05:20:18.833 --> 05:20:21.536 region:rollup2
MEANING SETTING A FLOOR AND

05:20:20.101 --> 05:20:22.870 region:rollup2
DOCTORS EARLIER BOTH OF THIS

05:20:21.536 --> 05:20:25.139 region:rollup2
PANEL TO.

05:20:22.870 --> 05:20:26.140 region:rollup2
TO PROTEST THE INCOME I MEAN

05:20:25.139 --> 05:20:28.042 region:rollup2
THE THE.

05:20:26.140 --> 05:20:29.177 region:rollup2
PROCEDURE PRICE

05:20:28.042 --> 05:20:31.479 region:rollup2
OR WHAT THEY BRING IN SORRY.

05:20:29.177 --> 05:20:32.647 region:rollup2
.

05:20:31.479 --> 05:20:33.815 region:rollup2
AND I'M HOPING THAT SOMETHING

05:20:32.647 --> 05:20:35.483 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE WORKED ON I DON'T

05:20:33.815 --> 05:20:36.951 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE PERFECT SOLUTION

05:20:35.483 --> 05:20:38.853 region:rollup2
IS AND AND ALL THE.

05:20:36.951 --> 05:20:40.188 region:rollup2
ALL THAT I'VE SAID.

05:20:38.853 --> 05:20:41.923 region:rollup2
BUT I AM COMFORTABLE WITH

05:20:40.188 --> 05:20:43.357 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHERE YOU'RE

05:20:41.923 --> 05:20:45.259 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET IN THAT SOMETHING

05:20:43.357 --> 05:20:46.127 region:rollup2
THAT I WANT TO SUPPORT AND I

05:20:45.259 --> 05:20:48.229 region:rollup2
WOULD URGE. ALL TO SUPPORT.

05:20:46.127 --> 05:20:49.597 region:rollup2
.

05:20:48.229 --> 05:20:51.265 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY RAN OUT OF TIME

05:20:49.597 --> 05:20:54.068 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS. SIDE

05:20:51.265 --> 05:20:54.669 region:rollup2
I THINK CONVERSATION CONTINUE.

05:20:54.068 --> 05:20:55.970 region:rollup2
LOOK I'M STILL SKEPTIC ON THE

05:20:54.669 --> 05:20:58.072 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

05:20:55.970 --> 05:21:00.041 region:rollup2

THE.

05:21:05.646 --> 05:21:08.316 region:rollup2
THE FAIREST APPROACH.

05:21:07.348 --> 05:21:10.585 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE.

05:21:08.316 --> 05:21:11.786 region:rollup2
AT BOTH.

05:21:10.585 --> 05:21:13.187 region:rollup2

CONSULTING WITH THE OPPOSITION.

05:21:14.722 --> 05:21:18.726 region:rollup2
.

05:21:16.824 --> 05:21:20.094 region:rollup2
AND HOW

05:21:18.726 --> 05:21:23.164 region:rollup2
LIKE A A I JUST FINE HARD IN

05:21:20.094 --> 05:21:23.965 region:rollup2
SOME CASES TO BELIEVE.

05:21:23.164 --> 05:21:25.299 region:rollup2
THAT IT DIDN'T A BILL WE CREATE

05:21:23.965 --> 05:21:26.300 region:rollup2
A FAIR SYSTEM.

05:21:25.299 --> 05:21:27.769 region:rollup2
BUT BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT IF

05:21:26.300 --> 05:21:28.870 region:rollup2
ANYONE CAN DO IT.

05:21:27.769 --> 05:21:29.737 region:rollup2

WITH THE OPPOSITION SAYS I

05:21:38.079 --> 05:21:40.047 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT'S MERITED AYE

05:21:38.679 --> 05:21:41.482 region:rollup2
IT'S HARD TO FORESEE A

05:21:40.047 --> 05:21:43.584 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

05:21:41.482 --> 05:21:45.253 region:rollup2
DESIGNING A RATES THAT ARE GOING

05:21:43.584 --> 05:21:46.988 region:rollup2
INCLUDE FACILITY UPGRADES ARE

05:21:45.253 --> 05:21:49.023 region:rollup2

IT.

05:21:49.023 --> 05:21:52.293 region:rollup2
ANY NATURAL BECAUSE I ME WHAT

05:21:50.525 --> 05:21:54.128 region:rollup2
HAPPENS IF THE FACILITY UPGRADE

PRICES SPIKE UP FOR ONE YEAR

05:21:58.166 --> 05:22:00.601 region:rollup2
AND THEN GO DOWN FOR ANOTHER

05:21:59.233 --> 05:22:03.004 region:rollup2
YEAR LEGAL QUESTIONS ARE HARD.

05:22:00.601 --> 05:22:03.538 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER.

05:22:03.004 --> 05:22:05.206 region:rollup2

THAT BRINGS A LOT OF EXPERTISE.

05:25:04.819 --> 05:25:09.824 region:rollup2
OKAY I THINK EVERYBODY HAS

05:25:06.187 --> 05:25:10.758 region:rollup2
SPOKEN EXCEPT FOR ME.

05:25:09.824 --> 05:25:12.126 region:rollup2
AND I GOT A LOT OF NOTES AND I'M

05:25:10.758 --> 05:25:13.127 region:rollup2
NOT GONNA BELIEVE FOR A LOT OF

05:25:12.126 --> 05:25:14.795 region:rollup2
POINTS BUT IT THERE ARE SOME.

05:25:13.127 --> 05:25:16.464 region:rollup2
MYTHS I'M A PUT SOME THINGS OUT

05:25:14.795 --> 05:25:18.165 region:rollup2
THERE THAT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT

05:25:16.464 --> 05:25:18.866 region:rollup2
THAT THAT DIDN'T COME UP

05:25:18.165 --> 05:25:21.369 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY.

05:25:18.866 --> 05:25:21.736 region:rollup2
OR DICK CAME UP THAT I MAY MAY

05:25:21.369 --> 05:25:22.203 region:rollup2
NOT AGREE WITH.

05:25:21.736 --> 05:25:25.072 region:rollup2
.

05:25:22.203 --> 05:25:26.140 region:rollup2
.

05:25:25.072 --> 05:25:28.142 region:rollup2
NOBODY TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

05:25:26.140 --> 05:25:29.944 region:rollup2
WHEN MEDICARE RATES GO DOWN THAT

05:25:28.142 --> 05:25:31.946 region:rollup2
ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLAR

05:25:29.944 --> 05:25:34.582 region:rollup2
DEFICIT INCREASE IS GOING TO

05:25:31.946 --> 05:25:37.618 region:rollup2
CAUSE MEDICARE RATES TO GO DOWN.

05:25:34.582 --> 05:25:39.754 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO CAN AFFECT MEDICAID.

05:25:37.618 --> 05:25:41.822 region:rollup2
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

05:25:39.754 --> 05:25:43.124 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

05:25:41.822 --> 05:25:46.026 region:rollup2
AND ALTHOUGH SAVINGS THAT WE'RE

05:25:43.124 --> 05:25:46.861 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT MAY EVAPORATE.

05:25:46.026 --> 05:25:49.163 region:rollup2
WITH THOSE DECREASE IN MEDICARE

05:25:46.861 --> 05:25:50.531 region:rollup2
RATES.

05:25:49.163 --> 05:25:51.732 region:rollup2
THIS IS MORE COMMENTARY NOT

05:25:50.531 --> 05:25:52.800 region:rollup2
ASKING TO CONTENT JUMP JUSTICES

05:25:51.732 --> 05:25:54.702 region:rollup2
COMMENTARY.

05:25:52.800 --> 05:25:56.504 region:rollup2
.

05:25:54.702 --> 05:25:58.272 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT HOSPITALS BEING A

05:25:56.504 --> 05:25:59.974 region:rollup2
DRIVER IN THE COST AND THEY ARE

05:25:58.272 --> 05:26:01.041 region:rollup2
THE LEADING COST OF I BELIEVE

05:25:59.974 --> 05:26:03.110 region:rollup2
THAT CAME FROM.

05:26:01.041 --> 05:26:04.812 region:rollup2
MICHELLE CREEK CABRERA ABOUT

05:26:03.110 --> 05:26:07.314 region:rollup2
THEIR THAT THE LEADING COST

05:26:04.812 --> 05:26:08.416 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE FASTEST GROWING COST.

05:26:07.314 --> 05:26:10.451 region:rollup2
THAT MAY BE TRUE.

05:26:08.416 --> 05:26:12.486 region:rollup2
BUT.

05:26:10.451 --> 05:26:15.289 region:rollup2
DRUG PRICES ARE ONE OF THE

05:26:12.486 --> 05:26:16.724 region:rollup2
REASONS THAT HOSPITALS ARE.

05:26:15.289 --> 05:26:18.325 region:rollup2
COSTS ARE GOING UP AND SURGERY

05:26:16.724 --> 05:26:20.060 region:rollup2
CENTERS

05:26:18.325 --> 05:26:22.329 region:rollup2
AND THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT SO WE

05:26:20.060 --> 05:26:24.165 region:rollup2
LEARNED THAT LAST YEAR WE TALKED

05:26:22.329 --> 05:26:25.966 region:rollup2
ABOUT DRUG PRICES. YES DRUG

05:26:24.165 --> 05:26:28.002 region:rollup2
PRICES MAY BE ON DRUGS MAY ONLY

05:26:25.966 --> 05:26:30.137 region:rollup2
BE THIRTEEN PERCENT BUT WHEN YOU

05:26:28.002 --> 05:26:31.338 region:rollup2
FACTOR IN HOSPITALS AND SURGERY

05:26:30.137 --> 05:26:32.840 region:rollup2
CENTERS THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO

05:26:31.338 --> 05:26:35.042 region:rollup2
OVER TWENTY.

05:26:32.840 --> 05:26:36.977 region:rollup2
SO SO.

05:26:35.042 --> 05:26:37.545 region:rollup2
JUST PUTTING THE INFORMATION

05:26:36.977 --> 05:26:39.213 region:rollup2
PRINT IT MAY INFORMATION OUT

05:26:37.545 --> 05:26:40.448 region:rollup2
THERE.

05:26:39.213 --> 05:26:42.283 region:rollup2
I AM CONCERNED WE HEARD A BILL

05:26:40.448 --> 05:26:44.085 region:rollup2
TODAY WE HAVE TWENTY HOSPITALS

05:26:42.283 --> 05:26:46.487 region:rollup2
WE WE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING

05:26:44.085 --> 05:26:50.091 region:rollup2
AT SEISMIC EXTENSION ON SEISMIC.

05:26:46.487 --> 05:26:52.726 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS.

05:26:50.091 --> 05:26:55.095 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE

05:26:52.726 --> 05:26:56.297 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO REBUILD HOSPITALS

05:26:55.095 --> 05:26:57.965 region:rollup2
LOMA LINDA IS TEARING DOWN A

05:26:56.297 --> 05:26:59.333 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL IN BUILDING A MILLION

05:26:57.965 --> 05:26:59.900 region:rollup2
SQUARE FEET I CAN'T EVEN

05:26:59.333 --> 05:27:01.569 region:rollup2
COMPREHEND A MILLION SQUARE

05:26:59.900 --> 05:27:02.603 region:rollup2
FEET?

05:27:01.569 --> 05:27:03.571 region:rollup2
I CANNOT COMPREHEND MILLION

05:27:02.603 --> 05:27:05.172 region:rollup2
ANYTHING.

05:27:03.571 --> 05:27:06.674 region:rollup2
.

05:27:05.172 --> 05:27:08.442 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IS A HUGE HUGE COST

05:27:06.674 --> 05:27:10.511 region:rollup2
HUGE COST

05:27:08.442 --> 05:27:12.780 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S SIGNIFICANT.

05:27:10.511 --> 05:27:13.814 region:rollup2
STUDENT DEBT I WISH IT WAS TWO

05:27:12.780 --> 05:27:14.982 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR FOR

05:27:13.814 --> 05:27:16.417 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS GET NOW SCHOOL BUT

05:27:14.982 --> 05:27:17.351 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER IS.

05:27:16.417 --> 05:27:19.854 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS WAY

05:27:17.351 --> 05:27:21.889 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THAT.

05:27:19.854 --> 05:27:23.357 region:rollup2
AND WHILE YOU DID SO SOMEONE DID

05:27:21.889 --> 05:27:24.825 region:rollup2
SAY THAT YEAH THERE WE'VE WE

05:27:23.357 --> 05:27:27.061 region:rollup2
HAVE NIPPED THE BOTTOM ON

05:27:24.825 --> 05:27:29.363 region:rollup2
NURSING SHORTAGES NOT MY

05:27:27.061 --> 05:27:33.133 region:rollup2
DISTRICT. HUMBOLDT COUNTY.

05:27:29.363 --> 05:27:34.702 region:rollup2
NURSING SHORTAGE CRISIS.

05:27:33.133 --> 05:27:36.237 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

05:27:34.702 --> 05:27:36.737 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF TIMES YOU SAID RURAL.

05:27:36.237 --> 05:27:38.606 region:rollup2
YOU OUGHT TO COME TO MY

05:27:36.737 --> 05:27:40.074 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

05:27:38.606 --> 05:27:41.208 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T KNOW RURAL INTO YOU'VE

05:27:40.074 --> 05:27:42.610 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT COME TO

05:27:41.208 --> 05:27:43.511 region:rollup2
MISS AGUIAR-CURRY.

05:27:42.610 --> 05:27:44.912 region:rollup2
FLORA.

05:27:43.511 --> 05:27:46.347 region:rollup2
PARTS MISTER MAYES MISTER

05:27:44.912 --> 05:27:48.816 region:rollup2
BIGELOW.

05:27:46.347 --> 05:27:50.251 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT.

05:27:48.816 --> 05:27:52.553 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AND EVEN

05:27:50.251 --> 05:27:54.255 region:rollup2
WITH INCREASE MEDICARE RATES.

05:27:52.553 --> 05:27:55.523 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE HOW WE GET DOCTORS

05:27:54.255 --> 05:27:58.025 region:rollup2
WHERE WE NEED THEM TO GET

05:27:55.523 --> 05:27:59.493 region:rollup2
BECAUSEWE HAVE TO PAY DOCTORS

05:27:58.025 --> 05:28:01.462 region:rollup2
WERE THAT WE HAVE TO HELP THEIR

05:27:59.493 --> 05:28:02.630 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND SO. YOU TALKED

05:28:01.462 --> 05:28:04.532 region:rollup2
ABOUT INST PEOPLE SOMEONE TALK

05:28:02.630 --> 05:28:06.267 region:rollup2
BUT IN THE INDUSTRIAL KIND EYES

05:28:04.532 --> 05:28:07.801 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES AND HOW THEY HAVE. THE

05:28:06.267 --> 05:28:10.471 region:rollup2
ONE THING THAT THEY'VE ALL DONE

05:28:07.801 --> 05:28:11.605 region:rollup2
TO IT TO MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE

05:28:10.471 --> 05:28:13.641 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE IS IS FIX PRICES.

05:28:11.605 --> 05:28:14.708 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO THINGS.

05:28:13.641 --> 05:28:16.877 region:rollup2
OTHER THING THEY'VE DONE IS

05:28:14.708 --> 05:28:18.879 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZED MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR

05:28:16.877 --> 05:28:21.015 region:rollup2
ALL PROVIDERS NOT JUST DOCTORS.

05:28:18.879 --> 05:28:22.449 region:rollup2
BUT NURSES AND EVERYONE ELSE.

05:28:21.015 --> 05:28:23.951 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO GET THAT OUT THAT

05:28:22.449 --> 05:28:24.818 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BIG BIG COMPONENT FOR

05:28:23.951 --> 05:28:27.521 region:rollup2
US GOING FORWARD.

05:28:24.818 --> 05:28:27.922 region:rollup2
.

05:28:27.521 --> 05:28:29.890 region:rollup2
I COULD GO ON.

05:28:27.922 --> 05:28:30.524 region:rollup2
AND I I I DO GET CONCERNED

05:28:29.890 --> 05:28:33.327 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

05:28:30.524 --> 05:28:35.262 region:rollup2
WHEN REVENUES GO DOWN BUT THIS

05:28:33.327 --> 05:28:35.996 region:rollup2
AT MEAN TO THE WORK FORCE.

05:28:35.262 --> 05:28:38.332 region:rollup2
AND.

05:28:35.996 --> 05:28:39.366 region:rollup2
AND I I DO HAVE HAVE CONCERNS

05:28:38.332 --> 05:28:41.402 region:rollup2
ABOUT DOT SO.

05:28:39.366 --> 05:28:43.938 region:rollup2

BUT I WANT TO SAY YOU KNOW.

05:28:43.938 --> 05:28:47.875 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE COST IN AFFORDABILITY

05:28:46.140 --> 05:28:49.310 region:rollup2
IS IS A REAL PROBLEM ONCE A

05:28:47.875 --> 05:28:51.278 region:rollup2
PERSONAL STRUGGLE FOR SO MANY

05:28:49.310 --> 05:28:52.413 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SO MANY PEOPLE IN MY

05:28:51.278 --> 05:28:53.881 region:rollup2

I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THAT'S

05:29:00.955 --> 05:29:04.325 region:rollup2
GOING TO COST IN THE AND.

05:29:02.222 --> 05:29:05.993 region:rollup2
I DON'T HOW OR HOW MANY DOCTORS

CALLS. WE KNOW THAT THEIR FEARS

05:29:23.077 --> 05:29:25.713 region:rollup2
ARE REAL AND SOME OF THESE FEARS

05:29:24.445 --> 05:29:26.814 region:rollup2
ARE GENERATED FROM THAT

05:29:25.713 --> 05:29:28.115 region:rollup2

05:29:50.204 --> 05:29:53.073 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECT.

PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

05:29:56.210 --> 05:30:00.247 region:rollup2
THAT.

05:29:58.178 --> 05:30:01.949 region:rollup2
I'M AYE AYE. AYE ASK HARD

05:30:00.247 --> 05:30:04.251 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

05:30:01.949 --> 05:30:05.286 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ANSWERS AND IT IS NOT

05:30:04.251 --> 05:30:06.553 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF

05:30:05.286 --> 05:30:08.355 region:rollup2
TRYING TO.

05:30:06.553 --> 05:30:09.957 region:rollup2
SQUASH AND ISSUE IT'S IN THE

05:30:08.355 --> 05:30:11.492 region:rollup2
SPIRIT OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

05:30:09.957 --> 05:30:13.327 region:rollup2
AND BRING THOSE ISSUES OUT SO WE

05:30:11.492 --> 05:30:15.296 region:rollup2
CAN TALK ABOUT THEM.

05:30:13.327 --> 05:30:16.697 region:rollup2
I THINK YOU'VE WITNESSED TODAY.

05:30:15.296 --> 05:30:17.731 region:rollup2
THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THIS

05:30:16.697 --> 05:30:19.066 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAVE QUITE FEW

05:30:17.731 --> 05:30:20.100 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND

05:30:19.066 --> 05:30:22.136 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH.

05:30:20.100 --> 05:30:23.070 region:rollup2
.

05:30:22.136 --> 05:30:24.171 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERYONE ON THIS

05:30:23.070 --> 05:30:25.172 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WANTS TO ADDRESS COST

05:30:24.171 --> 05:30:26.273 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT.

05:30:25.172 --> 05:30:27.608 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY

05:30:26.273 --> 05:30:30.344 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT RATE REGULATIONS

05:30:27.608 --> 05:30:31.445 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT RIGHT DIRECTION.

05:30:30.344 --> 05:30:32.079 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THE

05:30:31.445 --> 05:30:33.414 region:rollup2
BILL'S GOING WITHOUT A COMMITTEE

05:30:32.079 --> 05:30:34.515 region:rollup2

05:30:33.414 --> 05:30:36.684 region:rollup2
AND.

05:30:34.515 --> 05:30:37.351 region:rollup2
AS IT CONTINUES TO THE MOVE

05:30:36.684 --> 05:30:39.219 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE PROCESS I HOPE TO BE

05:30:37.351 --> 05:30:40.521 region:rollup2
OPEN TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS

05:30:39.219 --> 05:30:42.289 region:rollup2

05:30:46.160 --> 05:30:48.962 region:rollup2

COST CONTAINMENT. WHILE

05:30:56.103 --> 05:31:00.474 region:rollup2

05:31:00.474 --> 05:31:04.978 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT CARROT A CARROT.

05:31:03.243 --> 05:31:06.814 region:rollup2

DO IT BUT IT IS THE MOST

06:48:00.056 --> 06:48:03.559 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE WAY TO DO IT. AND HERE

06:48:01.557 --> 06:48:05.661 region:rollup2

THE SEDATION IS NOT A DENTAL

06:48:10.166 --> 06:48:14.537 region:rollup2
ISSUE IT'S A MEDICAL ISSUE THEY

06:48:11.801 --> 06:48:16.272 region:rollup2

SOME MEDICAL INTERVENTION.

06:48:16.272 --> 06:48:19.075 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE ISSUE HERE AND SO

06:48:17.573 --> 06:48:21.043 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE INTEGRATION IS

06:48:19.075 --> 06:48:22.244 region:rollup2
MISSING. AND IT IS A LEUPOLD

06:53:06.762 --> 06:53:09.932 region:rollup2
HAD CLOTHES ON OUR BACK

06:53:08.264 --> 06:53:11.267 region:rollup2
WE HAD THE FOOD WE HAD A ROOF

06:53:09.932 --> 06:53:12.368 region:rollup2
OVER OUR HEADS.

06:53:11.267 --> 06:53:13.669 region:rollup2
BUT I NEVER REALIZED THE

06:53:12.368 --> 06:53:15.304 region:rollup2
MAGNITUDE OF BILLS THAT WERE

06:53:13.669 --> 06:53:17.506 region:rollup2
PILING UP IN THE FINANCIAL

06:53:15.304 --> 06:53:19.008 region:rollup2
HARDSHIP YOU'RE ACTUALLY IN.

06:53:17.506 --> 06:53:20.209 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY

06:53:19.008 --> 06:53:21.644 region:rollup2
WOULD BRING MEALS FOR US EVERY

06:53:20.209 --> 06:53:23.746 region:rollup2
WEEK YOU'D GET ANONYMOUS

06:53:21.644 --> 06:53:24.213 region:rollup2
SPONSORS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

06:53:23.746 --> 06:53:25.414 region:rollup2
ON OUR EXTRACURRICULAR

06:53:24.213 --> 06:53:26.615 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

06:53:25.414 --> 06:53:28.317 region:rollup2
I WE THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE MY

06:53:26.615 --> 06:53:29.652 region:rollup2
MOM WAS SICK WHICH IT WAS BUT IT

06:53:28.317 --> 06:53:31.287 region:rollup2
WAS ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE IN SUCH A

06:53:29.652 --> 06:53:32.755 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP.

06:53:31.287 --> 06:53:34.089 region:rollup2
THIS MEDICATION THAT POTENTIALLY

06:53:32.755 --> 06:53:35.958 region:rollup2
COULD SAVE MY MOM'S LIFE WAS

06:53:34.089 --> 06:53:37.259 region:rollup2
BREAKING MY PANTS POCKETS.

06:53:35.958 --> 06:53:38.727 region:rollup2
I REMEMBER MY FATHER SHOWING ONE

06:53:37.259 --> 06:53:40.496 region:rollup2
OF HER ORAL CHEMOTHERAPY

06:53:38.727 --> 06:53:42.064 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS THE SMALL BOTTLE

06:53:40.496 --> 06:53:43.365 region:rollup2
CONTAINING ONLY THIRTY PILLS

06:53:42.064 --> 06:53:44.600 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

06:53:43.365 --> 06:53:47.269 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE DOLLARS

06:53:44.600 --> 06:53:48.637 region:rollup2
AND FORTY TWO CENTS.

06:53:47.269 --> 06:53:49.972 region:rollup2
ALL THESE DIFFERENT MEDICATIONS

06:53:48.637 --> 06:53:51.573 region:rollup2
WERE CAUSING MY PANTS THOUSANDS

06:53:49.972 --> 06:53:52.908 region:rollup2
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

06:53:51.573 --> 06:53:54.710 region:rollup2
ONE DAY I WAS HOPING MY FATHER

06:53:52.908 --> 06:53:55.944 region:rollup2
SORT THROUGH ALL THE BILLS. WE

06:53:54.710 --> 06:53:57.379 region:rollup2
LEARNED THAT MY MOM WAS SIGNING

06:53:55.944 --> 06:53:58.781 region:rollup2
UP FOR EVERY CREDIT CARD SHE

06:53:57.379 --> 06:53:59.748 region:rollup2
RECEIVED IN THE MAIL.

06:53:58.781 --> 06:54:01.617 region:rollup2
JUST SO SHE COULD PAY FOR THESE

06:53:59.748 --> 06:54:02.851 region:rollup2
MEDICATIONS.

06:54:01.617 --> 06:54:03.986 region:rollup2
MY DAD TOLD ME THERE WERE TIMES

06:54:02.851 --> 06:54:05.354 region:rollup2
THAT THEY STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR

06:54:03.986 --> 06:54:06.588 region:rollup2
HOME AND THEN MY MOM'S PARENTS

06:54:05.354 --> 06:54:08.057 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP OUT WITH THE MORTGAGE

06:54:06.588 --> 06:54:09.324 region:rollup2
FROM TIME TO TIME.

06:54:08.057 --> 06:54:11.260 region:rollup2
THESE MEDICATIONS WERE SO

06:54:09.324 --> 06:54:12.828 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE TO CONTINUE AND AFTER

06:54:11.260 --> 06:54:14.897 region:rollup2
FIGHTING FOR SEVEN YEARS MY MOM

06:54:12.828 --> 06:54:15.998 region:rollup2
DECIDED SHE WAS TOO TIRED.

06:54:14.897 --> 06:54:17.499 region:rollup2
SHE NO LONGER HAD A FIGHT AND

06:54:15.998 --> 06:54:18.434 region:rollup2
HER SOMETIMES CANCER RIGHT

06:54:17.499 --> 06:54:20.202 region:rollup2
ATTACKS MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN A

06:54:18.434 --> 06:54:21.270 region:rollup2
FAMILY.

06:54:20.202 --> 06:54:22.638 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY CANCER SEEMS TO

06:54:21.270 --> 06:54:27.109 region:rollup2
LOVE MY FAMILY.

THIS IS BEEN A TRAUMATIC TIME

06:54:47.629 --> 06:54:50.899 region:rollup2
FOR MY FAMILY AND I.

06:54:49.364 --> 06:54:52.735 region:rollup2

FINANCIAL ASPECT OF IT.

06:54:56.638 --> 06:55:01.977 region:rollup2

AND NO FAMILY. AND ALSO THE

06:55:01.977 --> 06:55:06.782 region:rollup2

ASPECT OF IT.

06:55:06.782 --> 06:55:09.785 region:rollup2
NO ONE DESERVES THE HARDSHIPS

06:55:08.083 --> 06:55:11.854 region:rollup2
OCCURS ALONG WITH THAT MENTALLY

06:55:09.785 --> 06:55:13.455 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY.

07:05:23.999 --> 07:05:27.669 region:rollup2
PLANS YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO.

07:05:25.567 --> 07:05:29.204 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THAT COST CARE CAP FOR

07:05:27.669 --> 07:05:30.672 region:rollup2
ANTI CANCER DRUGS WAS DIFFERENT

07:05:29.204 --> 07:05:32.307 region:rollup2
FROM ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT PRINT

07:05:30.672 --> 07:05:33.875 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THIS IS

07:05:32.307 --> 07:05:35.510 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME.

07:05:33.875 --> 07:05:38.646 region:rollup2
WHEN THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUG

07:05:35.510 --> 07:05:39.914 region:rollup2
CAPS IN PLACE NOT IN STATUTE.

07:05:38.646 --> 07:05:41.750 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW KIND OF INSULATES THE

07:05:39.914 --> 07:05:42.917 region:rollup2
CONSUMER FROM THE ACTUAL COST OF

07:05:41.750 --> 07:05:45.553 region:rollup2
THOSE DRUGS AND HELPS THEM

07:05:42.917 --> 07:05:46.321 region:rollup2
ACCESS THEM WITH THE SAME TIME

07:05:45.553 --> 07:05:48.189 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO ABSORB

07:05:46.321 --> 07:05:49.624 region:rollup2
THE. EXTREMELY HIGH COSTS FOR

07:05:48.189 --> 07:05:50.892 region:rollup2
ALL THESE DRUGS WHICH GET

07:05:49.624 --> 07:05:52.594 region:rollup2
SOCIALIZED OUT ON THE PREMIUM

07:05:50.892 --> 07:05:53.428 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION OF THE

07:05:52.594 --> 07:05:54.929 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT WE'VE CHOSEN TO

07:05:53.428 --> 07:05:56.564 region:rollup2
TAKE. WHO WERE SAYING AS WE'D

07:05:54.929 --> 07:05:58.666 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS DRUG TO FALL UNDER THE

07:05:56.564 --> 07:06:00.635 region:rollup2
RUBRIC WITH ALL THE RAP

07:05:58.666 --> 07:06:04.606 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THINK?

07:06:00.635 --> 07:06:05.840 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

07:06:04.606 --> 07:06:07.308 region:rollup2
CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

07:06:05.840 --> 07:06:09.677 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR

07:06:07.308 --> 07:06:11.246 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ANYONE.

07:06:09.677 --> 07:06:12.647 region:rollup2
MISS KOREA THINK YOU KNOW I LIKE

07:06:11.246 --> 07:06:14.549 region:rollup2
TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING

07:06:12.647 --> 07:06:17.552 region:rollup2
THIS TO OTHERS COMMITTEE.

07:06:14.549 --> 07:06:19.687 region:rollup2
I AM THE KNEES OF OF. MY AUNT

07:06:17.552 --> 07:06:21.389 region:rollup2
WHO HAD A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY AND

07:06:19.687 --> 07:06:23.224 region:rollup2
DIED OF BREAST CANCER.

07:06:21.389 --> 07:06:24.793 region:rollup2
TO MY AUNTS HAVE HAD ADDITIONAL

07:06:23.224 --> 07:06:26.861 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTS UPSWINGS.

07:06:24.793 --> 07:06:29.297 region:rollup2
AND LIKELY THERE.

07:06:26.861 --> 07:06:29.998 region:rollup2
THEIR HEALTH IS OKAY.

07:06:29.297 --> 07:06:34.302 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS IS AN

07:06:29.998 --> 07:06:35.970 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY CRITICAL CRITICAL.

07:06:34.302 --> 07:06:38.506 region:rollup2
MEASURE TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS

07:06:35.970 --> 07:06:39.340 region:rollup2
OF THE HEALTH. AND WELFARE OF

07:06:38.506 --> 07:06:42.110 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR STATES I

07:06:39.340 --> 07:06:44.012 region:rollup2
THINK YOU.

07:06:42.110 --> 07:06:44.879 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE ESTIMATES.

07:06:44.012 --> 07:06:46.147 region:rollup2
DID A MUCH OF I HEARD YOU

07:06:44.879 --> 07:06:47.048 region:rollup2
CORRECTLY WAS A ROOM.

07:06:46.147 --> 07:06:48.850 region:rollup2
FOR.

07:06:47.048 --> 07:06:50.051 region:rollup2
FTA HEALTH PLANS FOR AN

07:06:48.850 --> 07:06:51.586 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT THAT WOULD GET YOU HAS

07:06:50.051 --> 07:06:52.987 region:rollup2
THIRTY TWO TO BE SUPPORTIVE FOR

07:06:51.586 --> 07:06:54.622 region:rollup2
NOW.

07:06:52.987 --> 07:06:56.191 region:rollup2
SOME SOME OF THE OTHER HEALTH

07:06:54.622 --> 07:06:57.459 region:rollup2
PLANS SO SHE ASIANS HAVE AN

07:06:56.191 --> 07:06:58.726 region:rollup2
OPPOSING WAS A MINUTE POSITION

07:06:57.459 --> 07:06:59.994 region:rollup2
ON IT AND THEY'VE LIKE THAT I

07:06:58.726 --> 07:07:01.095 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE ASK IS THAT THE

07:06:59.994 --> 07:07:02.330 region:rollup2
COST.

07:07:01.095 --> 07:07:05.066 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION COST CAP HE SAID IT

07:07:02.330 --> 07:07:05.667 region:rollup2
TO FIFTY SO MIR'S WHAT'S IN

07:07:05.066 --> 07:07:08.837 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR ALL OTHER OUTPATIENT

07:07:05.667 --> 07:07:13.007 region:rollup2
DRUGS.

07:07:08.837 --> 07:07:14.609 region:rollup2
BIGELOW.

07:07:13.007 --> 07:07:15.610 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME

07:07:14.609 --> 07:07:17.145 region:rollup2
ROOM FOR AGREEMENT HERE.

07:07:15.610 --> 07:07:20.915 region:rollup2
AND MOVEMENT.

07:07:17.145 --> 07:07:21.683 region:rollup2
THERE'S TWO COURSES.

07:07:20.915 --> 07:07:24.953 region:rollup2
THE PLANS CAN MOVE TO THE TWO

07:07:21.683 --> 07:07:25.520 region:rollup2
FIFTY.

07:07:24.953 --> 07:07:27.956 region:rollup2
AND MAYBE WORK WITH YOU AND

07:07:25.520 --> 07:07:28.823 region:rollup2
HAVE.

07:07:27.956 --> 07:07:30.825 region:rollup2
SOME SOLIDARITY ON THIS VERY

07:07:28.823 --> 07:07:33.261 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

07:07:30.825 --> 07:07:34.229 region:rollup2
LAKE SECOND COURSES.

07:07:33.261 --> 07:07:36.097 region:rollup2
WE REDUCE EVERYTHING TO TWO

07:07:34.229 --> 07:07:38.967 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

07:07:36.097 --> 07:07:41.169 region:rollup2
AND MAKE IT ACROSS THE BOARD.

07:07:38.967 --> 07:07:42.036 region:rollup2
WHAT CHOICE?

07:07:41.169 --> 07:07:43.538 region:rollup2
OF THOSE TWO WOULD YOU LIKE TO

07:07:42.036 --> 07:07:45.740 region:rollup2
HAVE.

07:07:43.538 --> 07:07:47.775 region:rollup2
AS AN OPPORTUNITY SO I A

07:07:45.740 --> 07:07:49.544 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY

07:07:47.775 --> 07:07:51.579 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A PRICE INDEX

07:07:49.544 --> 07:07:52.447 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THIS AND SO. I'M

07:07:51.579 --> 07:07:53.448 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE.

07:07:52.447 --> 07:07:54.382 region:rollup2
WITH. A LOT OF THE TO THIS

07:07:53.448 --> 07:07:56.618 region:rollup2
PLACE.

07:07:54.382 --> 07:07:57.886 region:rollup2
I THINK IT SO WHEN THIS BILL WAS

07:07:56.618 --> 07:07:59.787 region:rollup2
PASSED FIVE YEARS AGO.

07:07:57.886 --> 07:08:01.890 region:rollup2
IT WAS A HARD NEGOTIATION AND

07:07:59.787 --> 07:08:04.225 region:rollup2
WE DID AND OF HAVING A CPI INDEX

07:08:01.890 --> 07:08:05.960 region:rollup2
ADDED TO THE BILL. AND IT HAS

07:08:04.225 --> 07:08:07.362 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN UTILIZED BY THE HEALTH

07:08:05.960 --> 07:08:09.664 region:rollup2
PLANS.

07:08:07.362 --> 07:08:09.864 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CPI FOR

07:08:09.664 --> 07:08:12.400 region:rollup2
THE.

07:08:09.864 --> 07:08:14.536 region:rollup2
MEDICAL PRICE INDEX UNDER THAT

07:08:12.400 --> 07:08:16.404 region:rollup2
COMES IN THE E. CATEGORIES.

07:08:14.536 --> 07:08:17.939 region:rollup2
AND YOU AVERAGE A COSTS THEY

07:08:16.404 --> 07:08:19.207 region:rollup2
COULD OF BEEN IT ABOUT TWO

07:08:17.939 --> 07:08:21.075 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY DOLLARS AND IT

07:08:19.207 --> 07:08:23.178 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER

07:08:21.075 --> 07:08:24.145 region:rollup2
THE YEARS AS THE PRICE INDEX

07:08:23.178 --> 07:08:25.780 region:rollup2
GOES UP SO THEY CAN UTILIZE IT

07:08:24.145 --> 07:08:26.147 region:rollup2
OR NOT UTILIZE IT AS THEY SEE

07:08:25.780 --> 07:08:27.815 region:rollup2
FIT AND IF NOT.

07:08:26.147 --> 07:08:31.786 region:rollup2
SAU.

07:08:27.815 --> 07:08:33.588 region:rollup2
HAVING HEARD THAT.

07:08:31.786 --> 07:08:35.356 region:rollup2
YOU'RE STILL AT GROUND ZERO.

07:08:33.588 --> 07:08:37.458 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE ALSO ASKING FOR THE

07:08:35.356 --> 07:08:39.961 region:rollup2
SUNSET TO BE REMOVED.

07:08:37.458 --> 07:08:41.329 region:rollup2
SO WHY NOT TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY.

07:08:39.961 --> 07:08:43.198 region:rollup2
TO NEGOTIATE A REALLY GOOD DEAL

07:08:41.329 --> 07:08:45.199 region:rollup2
HERE.

07:08:43.198 --> 07:08:46.768 region:rollup2
IN ONE WAY BRING.

07:08:45.199 --> 07:08:48.503 region:rollup2
EVERYONE TO PARITY AT THE TWO

07:08:46.768 --> 07:08:49.804 region:rollup2
FIFTY AND LET THEM USE THE CPI

07:08:48.503 --> 07:08:51.472 region:rollup2
INDEXING.

07:08:49.804 --> 07:08:53.575 region:rollup2
OR REDUCE EVERYBODY DOWN TO THE

07:08:51.472 --> 07:08:56.277 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED AND LET THEM CAPTURE

07:08:53.575 --> 07:08:56.744 region:rollup2
THE CPI AT THAT LEVEL

07:08:56.277 --> 07:08:58.079 region:rollup2
SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE AN

07:08:56.744 --> 07:09:00.148 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO WIN. AND GET

07:08:58.079 --> 07:09:02.750 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY WHAT THEY WANT.

07:09:00.148 --> 07:09:04.886 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AT TWO HUNDRED PLUS CPI

07:09:02.750 --> 07:09:07.522 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND IF SOMEONE BRINGS

07:09:04.886 --> 07:09:08.489 region:rollup2
US CONSIDERATIONS AND AMENDMENTS

07:09:07.522 --> 07:09:10.491 region:rollup2
WILL CONSIDER THAT WE'VE. YET TO

07:09:08.489 --> 07:09:11.826 region:rollup2
SEE IT SO I'M I'M SUGGESTING

07:09:10.491 --> 07:09:12.694 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT NOW APES FAVORITE

07:09:11.826 --> 07:09:14.062 region:rollup2
YEAH I APPRECIATE THE

07:09:12.694 --> 07:09:15.630 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS I DON'T KNOW THAT

07:09:14.062 --> 07:09:17.332 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT THIS

07:09:15.630 --> 07:09:18.499 region:rollup2
MOMENT BUT I APPRECIATE IT. AND

07:09:17.332 --> 07:09:19.567 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO HAVE A

07:09:18.499 --> 07:09:21.502 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

07:09:19.567 --> 07:09:22.937 region:rollup2
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S AT TWO

07:09:21.502 --> 07:09:23.905 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PLUS CPA I'M I DON'T

07:09:22.937 --> 07:09:25.640 region:rollup2
THINK I'M.

07:09:23.905 --> 07:09:27.408 region:rollup2
TOTALLY ARTICULATING

07:09:25.640 --> 07:09:29.010 region:rollup2
SINCE EVERYBODY IS ALREADY AT.

07:09:27.408 --> 07:09:30.578 region:rollup2
A TWO FIFTY ARE ALL THE OTHER

07:09:29.010 --> 07:09:32.513 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS OR TWO FIFTY.

07:09:30.578 --> 07:09:35.583 region:rollup2
AND YOU'RE ASKING THESE TO BE

07:09:32.513 --> 07:09:37.752 region:rollup2
SEPARATE AT TWO HUNDRED.

07:09:35.583 --> 07:09:39.587 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT NOT BE GOOD FOR YOU

07:09:37.752 --> 07:09:41.556 region:rollup2
TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT THE TWO

07:09:39.587 --> 07:09:43.691 region:rollup2
FIFTY WHERE THEY'RE ALL.

07:09:41.556 --> 07:09:46.361 region:rollup2
AT PARITY OR WOULD IT BE EASIER

07:09:43.691 --> 07:09:47.395 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO REDUCE EVERYBODY.

07:09:46.361 --> 07:09:49.163 region:rollup2
FROM TWO FIFTY DOWN TO TWO

07:09:47.395 --> 07:09:51.266 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND HAVE EVERYBODY AT

07:09:49.163 --> 07:09:55.036 region:rollup2
PARITY AND STILL ENJOY THE. THE

07:09:51.266 --> 07:09:55.903 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF CPI.

07:09:55.036 --> 07:09:57.405 region:rollup2

GOING OUT OF THAT.

07:10:01.809 --> 07:10:05.079 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOESN'T CALL TO REDUCE

07:10:03.544 --> 07:10:05.680 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING TO TWO HUNDRED AND IT

07:10:05.079 --> 07:10:07.282 region:rollup2
TOTALLY NOT I'M TALKING AS AN

07:10:05.680 --> 07:10:09.317 region:rollup2
OPTION.

07:10:07.282 --> 07:10:10.318 region:rollup2
AND I'M SURE THEAUTHOR WOULD.

07:10:09.317 --> 07:10:12.053 region:rollup2

PRE EXISTING BILL BUT WAS IT

07:10:19.761 --> 07:10:24.032 region:rollup2
