LAUNCH A CLOUD BASED SYSTEM US

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.390
AND LEVERAGING LIKE AMAZON'S

01:42:43.457 --> 01:42:46.226
DELIVERY PLATFORM IN. THAT HAS

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:46.994
BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE ALONG SIDE

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:50.631

THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE

01:42:52.699 --> 01:42:54.234
DELIVERED. SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:56.670
ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD NOW AND

01:42:56.737 --> 01:42:59.640

THERE'S ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:07.848
THAT- COULD BE CONSIDERED. I

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:10.217

TIME LINES JUST SEEM TOTALLY

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.575

EACH LIKE. OFFICE AND THAT WAS

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.526

MONTHS FOR ANALYSES ON WHETHER

01:44:23.156 --> 01:44:24.091
OR NOT IT DATA DASHBOARD MAKES

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:25.892
SENSE TO ACTUALLY. MAKE

01:44:25.959 --> 01:44:29.229
SOLUTIONS HAPPEN NOW IN

01:44:29.296 --> 01:44:31.331
PROGRESS NOW HAVE. WITH THAT

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD

01:44:38.205 --> 01:44:39.373
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:41.642
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PORTION

01:44:41.708 --> 01:44:43.977
OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE I'VE

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:45.646
YOU THIS THIS FAILURE AS

01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:47.781
PREDOMINANTLY IN I. T. FAILURE-

01:44:47.848 --> 01:44:49.916
IT'S HORRIFYING TO THINK ABOUT

01:44:49.983 --> 01:44:51.284
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SOME OF

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:52.386
THE SYSTEM STILL RUNNING AND

01:44:52.452 --> 01:44:54.588
COBALT. AND BY THE WAY I IN MY

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:55.889
DAY I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD

01:44:55.956 --> 01:44:57.724
PROGRAM AND I KNOW COBLE SO IF

01:44:57.791 --> 01:45:00.527
PUBLIC SERVICE DOESN'T WORK OUT

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:02.329
FOR ME YOU SHOULD LOOK ME UP.

01:45:02.396 --> 01:45:05.032
SO I'M GRATIFIED TO HEAR THAT

01:45:05.098 --> 01:45:06.433
WE'VE GOT A STRIKE TEAM THAT'S

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.300
GOING TO BE INVESTIGATING

01:45:07.367 --> 01:45:09.536
REPLACEMENT OF THAT SYSTEM. AND

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:10.671
I'M SURE THAT THE INDUSTRY

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:12.673
PARTNERS THAT YOU HAVE- THAT

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.708
YOU HAVE ENGAGED. ARE GOING TO

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:17.077
TELL YOU THAT- THE WAY TO SOLVE

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:18.545
THESE PROBLEMS IS TO MAKE IT SO

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:19.780
THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN FILE

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:21.815
CLAIMS WITHOUT HAVING. ANY KIND

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.517
OF PROBLEM AND THE ONES THAT DO

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:25.819
HAVE PROBLEMS- ENABLE THEM TO

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:27.354
SUBMIT THEIR DOCUMENTS

01:45:27.421 --> 01:45:28.889
ELECTRONICALLY AND HAVE A AN

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.724
AUTOMATED REVIEW PROCESS. TO

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:31.692
MAKE IT SHOULD MAKE IT SO THAT

01:45:31.758 --> 01:45:33.393
A- HUMAN DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:35.128
GET INVOLVED. AND THAT'S HOW

01:45:35.195 --> 01:45:38.165
YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HAVING

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:39.399
TO STAFF ON HUGE CALL CENTERS.

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:44.838
IF I JUST ENDING A SYSTEM IN.

01:45:44.905 --> 01:45:46.006
GET THE HOMES ALL WITHOUT

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:47.974
ACTUALLY HAVING TO CALL. SO

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:51.578
YOUR DOG GO AHEAD IF YOU'D LIKE.

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.213
I WOULD HAVE TOTALLY AGREE WITH

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:53.880
YOU AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:45:53.947 --> 01:45:55.415
EXCITED THAT- WILL BE AWARDING

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:56.850
A VENDOR IN OCTOBER FOR

01:45:56.917 --> 01:45:59.152
COMPLETE AND REPLACEMENT OF OUR

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:02.022
SYSTEM. I KNOW WE'RE ALL

01:46:02.089 --> 01:46:03.323
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT

01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:04.758
I HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH IN THE

01:46:04.825 --> 01:46:07.127
SHORTER TERM. BECAUSE AS YOU

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.262
MENTIONED. CARE IS TO IS

01:46:09.329 --> 01:46:11.665
CURRENTLY BEING NEGOTIATED AND

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:14.067
CONGRESS. AND I SHOULD THAT

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:16.069
PASS IT IS LIKELY THAT THE

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.704
STRUCTURE OF THOSE ENHANCED

01:46:17.771 --> 01:46:20.040
FEDERAL. THAT WILL BE MORE

01:46:20.107 --> 01:46:22.042
COMPLEX THAN IT HAS BEEN BEFORE

01:46:22.109 --> 01:46:23.410
SO IN OTHER WORDS INSTEAD OF

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:24.644
JUST A FLAT AMOUNT PER WEEK

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:25.946
IT'S LIKELY TO BE PERHAPS A

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.748
PERCENTAGE. OF THE REPLACEMENT

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:29.616
WAGES THAT THE CLAIMANT HAD

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:31.651
EARNED AND I'M CONCERNED AND

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:33.253
HERE'S MY QUESTION DOES OUR

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.988
EXISTING SYSTEM HAVE THE

01:46:35.055 --> 01:46:38.058
CAPACITY. TO HANDLE THEY CALL

01:46:38.125 --> 01:46:40.026
FOR LIKE THAT AND WHAT KIND OF

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.194
DIFFICULTY ARE WE GONNA HAVE

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:46.733
SPENDING THAT UP. YES WE'VE

01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.369
ACTUALLY BEEN- THEY REACHED OUT

01:46:49.436 --> 01:46:50.170
TO US ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:52.572
ITERATIONS AND- HOW LONG WOULD

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:56.543
IT TAKE A- IT IT DEPENDING ON

01:46:56.610 --> 01:47:01.181
THE COMPLEXITY OF WHAT THE

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:03.183
PACKAGE INCLUDES. FROM ANY TIME

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:07.721
MORTGAGE. HIGHER WAGES THAT IS

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:08.688
VERY CHALLENGING- MATTER

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:10.857
BETWEEN TWELVE THE TWENTY WEEK

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:15.829
PROGRAMMING. SO IF I'M STANDING

01:47:15.896 --> 01:47:17.898
EVEN IF CONGRESS WERE TO ACTON

01:47:17.964 --> 01:47:20.734
EXTEND FEDERAL A SUPPLEMENTAL

01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:22.369
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:24.171
SHOULD THAT TAKE THE STRUCTURE

01:47:24.237 --> 01:47:25.438
THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT

01:47:25.505 --> 01:47:26.606
TO TAKE US UP TO TWENTY WEEKS

01:47:26.673 --> 01:47:29.176
BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO START

01:47:29.242 --> 01:47:31.611
PROCESSING THOSE CLAIMS. YEAH

01:47:31.678 --> 01:47:33.246
ABSOLUTELY BEEN COMMUNICATING

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:35.615
BACK THE NATIONAL LEVEL AS WELL

01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:37.717
AS FAR AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT

01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:40.353
OF. LABOR EVERYONE VERY AWARE

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:41.855
OF IT AND WE'RE NOT THE OLY

01:47:41.922 --> 01:47:43.657
STATE IN THIS IN THIS SITUATION

01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:45.826
MANY MANY OTHER STATES HAVE

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:47.494
ANTIQUATED SYSTEM BUT WELL. THE

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:48.795
FEDERAL LEVEL HAS NOT SPENT

01:47:48.862 --> 01:47:51.431
MONEY ON MODERNIZATIONS FOR

01:47:51.498 --> 01:47:54.067
YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO

01:47:54.134 --> 01:47:57.938
THAT'S WHY SO MANY. A I AND

01:47:58.004 --> 01:48:00.574
INSTALLATION. IF I COULD DOWN

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.274
ON THAT JUST FOR A MINUTE I'M

01:48:01.341 --> 01:48:03.877
IN STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHY

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:05.278
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND I'M

01:48:05.345 --> 01:48:07.914
NOT AN EXPERT I YOUR IT

01:48:07.981 --> 01:48:09.549
SYSTEMS BUT I KNOW SOMETHING

01:48:09.616 --> 01:48:12.552
ABOUT IT. IF INFORMATION ON

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:15.522
PAST CLIMATE HISTORY IN SALARY

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:17.591
IS THERE IN THE SYSTEM AND

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.292
