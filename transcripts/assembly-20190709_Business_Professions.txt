REGULARLY SCHEDULED BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS HEARING -- FOR FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS THE FOLLOWING BILLS HAVE BEEN PULLED BY AUTHOR SB THREE TWENTY FIVE BY SENATOR HILL AND SB FOUR EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR PAN AGAIN A TWO BILLS HAVE BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR. WE DIDN'T CURRENTLY ARE ABSENCE A QUORUM SO BE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND THEN WE'LL GO AND FILE ORDER WILL BEGIN THEN WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS SB FIFTY ONE BY. THE SENATOR HERTZBERG. CENTER HERTZBERG WELCOME. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I'M READY SHERMAN. I'M READY. AND I PUT MY FILE UP HERE BECAUSE I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. AS THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA BY A WIDE MARGIN. SHOWS RECENTLY TO LEGALIZE RECREATIONAL CANNABIS. LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. CHALLENGES THE FEDERAL BANKING SYSTEM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHARACTERIZES CANNABIS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHICH MEANS THAT IN THE BANKING SYSTEM. YOU CAN'T DEPOSIT THE PROCEEDS OF THAT BUSINESS IT'S IT'S CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. SO WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU TRY TO BALANCE ON THE ONE HAND. THE PUBLIC POLICY IS INFORMED BY THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA ONE ON THE OTHER HAND YOU'VE GOT A COMPLETELY CONTRADICTORY FEDERAL POLICY. HOW DO YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM? THAT PROBLEM HAS BEEN FURTHER EXACERBATED BY. THE FACT THAT IS RESOLVED THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY IS CASH. SENATE MCGUIRE INFORMS ME DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACCURATE THAT THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS BURIED NORTHERN CALIFORNIAN BARRELS. GENTLEMAN CAME TO MY OFFICE AND SAID HE HAD FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THE TRACTOR TRAILER YOU CAN PARK IN MY GARAGE. IT'S CREATED AN EXTRAORDINARILY PUBLIC SAFETY -- PROBLEM IT IS THE TREASURER WHO IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH NOW FOR TWO YEARS THEN SHE WAS THE AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. TALKS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ACCOUNTING. AND RECORD KEEPING IN THIS INDUSTRY. AND ALSO IT HAS A HORRIBLE IMPLICATION IN TERMS OF COST WE'VE SEEN IN OUR BUDGET BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS BECAUSE BECAUSE GOVERNMENT OFFICES GOT A PUT ON BULLETPROOF GLASS GOVERNMENT OFFICES HAVE TO HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES. IT TAKES SOMETHING LIKE THAT THREE THREE POLICE TODAY A FULL DAY TO COUNT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOUR ACCOUNT OF THREE TIMES RIGHT. HE GOT C. H. P. ESCORTS TAKEN MONEY TO THE BANK TO GET PEOPLE BEING ROBBED. WHAT DO YOU DO HOW DO YOU FIGURE IT OUT? INNER THIS MEASURE. IT IS NOT A PERFECT MEASURE ALTHOUGH EVERY OTHER BILL I'VE EVER TO DEUCE HAS BEEN SO FIRST EVER OMITTED THAT. NOT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT I'M THE BILL WHAT IT IS IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A CREATIVE WAY. TO AT LEAST. GO AS FAR AS WE CAN UNDER THESE VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN INTERIM DEAL UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT SOME TIME BECAUSE OTHER STATES HAVE LEGALIZED CANNABIS. IS GOING TO CHANGE ITS RULES SO HOW DO WE CREATE AN INTERIM BRIDGE THAT WORKS WITHIN THE SYSTEM REASONABLY WELL THAT SOLVES MANY PROBLEMS YOU CAN AND TAKES US DOWN THE ROAD IT'S FAR AS YOU CAN. THAT'S AS CONSERVATIVE AS POSSIBLE AND NOT TOO COMPLEX. SO INSTEAD OF COMING UP WITH A COCKAMAMIE PUBLIC BANK IDEA -- WHICH COULD TAKE FORTY YEARS TO GET IT IMPLEMENTED AND IT NEVER WORKED THE IDEA WAS TO BOLT ON TO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF OF BANKS AND SH AND CREDIT UNIONS. ARE A PROCESS WHEREBY WE CAN CREATE A LIMITED CHARTER WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WHY HAVE WE STRUCTURED THE WAY WE STRUCTURE WITH THE TREASURE. RESTRUCTURED AGAIN BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERIM PLAY. THE IDEA IF IT'S A BANK IT HAS TO LIVE BY AND LIVE UNDER THE RULES OF THE BANKING COMMISSIONER WHATEVER IT'S CALLED TODAY'S FANCY NEW NAMES ON MIDDLE GUY RIP I STILL CALM BANK. PHONE BANKING COMMISSION WE A NEW BANK COMMISSIONER. SO THAT MEANS THAT THE RULES INVOLVING FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS REPORTING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT LOOKS AND FEELS AND SMELLS LIKE A BANK ITWILL DO EXCEPT IT HAS A LIMITED CHARTER TO SERVE FOR PURPOSES. AND IT'S WHAT'S CALLED A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM WHAT CREATES THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S THAT WE USE THE FEDERAL WIRE WE USE THE CLEARING HOUSES IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. WHICH THEN BRINGS IT TO THEIR JURISDICTIONS SECONDLY WE USE FDIC DEPOSIT INSURANCE A TOUR FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A POP THAT BRINGS IT UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION. SO HOW DOES A STATE ORGANIZED THAT IN A WAY CREATES A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM OUTSIDE THE FEDS. IT DOES IT BY ONE USING PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES I'VE TALKED TO SAID THAT THEY WOULD INSURE Là COMPANIES WILLING TO TO ENSURE THE COST OF INSURANCE EXPENSIVE IT'S A HECK OF A LOT LESS THAN SECURITY GUARDS. INSURANCE AND ALL THE THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE INFORMED BY ANYBODY IN THE BANKING BUSINESS I MEAN THE KIND OF HIS BUSINESS. AND SECONDLY YOU DON'T ALLOW DEPOSITS TO BE MOVED INTO FEDERAL INSTITUTIONS THAT MEANS IF I HAVE THE SAY THE EVAN LOW CANNABIS CHARTER BANK RIGHT AND I GOT AN ACCOUNT AT THE BANK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS I GIVE EVAN LOW BANK MY CASH. CANNABIS BAKE MY CASH THEY DEPOSIT GIVE ME A RECEIPT THE BANKS IT'S THERE HE THEN EVAN LOADS BANK GIVES ME A OUR CHECK A CHECK BOOK. THAT CHECKBOOK LOOKS LIKE A CHECK LIKE THIS. IT SAYS BASICALLY THIS CHECK IS ISSUED BY EVAN LOW BANK PURSUANT TO SUCH AS CAN ONLY BE DEPOSITED EVAN LOW'S BANK OR ANYBODY WITH WHOM EVAN LOW HAS IT HAS IT HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH. NOW IN ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE'S THE GIPSON CANNABIS BANK. AND SO GIPSON BANK AND EVAN LOW BANK HAVE AN AGREEMENT I'LL TAKE YOUR CHECKS YOU TAKE MY CHECKS WE JUST CAN'T PUT IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. SO THERE'S AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GOT OBERNOLTE IN THEM HIGHER BANK. AND A BRAWL IN SOUTHERN CAL IN IN ORANGE COUNTY RIGHT SO YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT BANKS YOU GUYS HAVE AN AGREEMENT IT DOES MONEY DOESN'T TOUCH. THEIR NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE BANKS IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE EMPTY THERE ARE CERTAIN OFTHE CLOSE BECAUSE BANKING BRANCHES ARE CLOSING. SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE THIS COULD BE AN EASY DEAL HAVE AN URGENCY PROVISION BECAUSE LAST YEAR I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE LAST ADMINISTRATION I BELIEVE IN EVERY. INSTINCTS THAT I EVER EVERY PIECE OF POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE I HAVE THE DISCOVER WILL SIGN. KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED YOU NEVER KNOW AND THAT WE MADE THIS AN URGENCY BILL WE HAD ALMOST FULL SUPPORT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN THIS DEAL. AND BASICALLY THE BOTTOM LINE OF FINISH HERE IS THAT WHAT DO YOU USE THE MONEY FOR IN THIS LIMITED CHARTER BANKS. USE THEM. FOR ONE AREN'T YOU CAN USE TO PAY YOUR RENT I'M A LANDLORDS AND HAVING SOMEBODY COME A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PAY THE RENT THE CAN THE PROJECT. LANDLORD CAN TAKE AND THE AND GET THE MONEY AND THEN THEY CAN TRANSPORTED BY ARMORED CAR TO THEIR BANK OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. TO TO PAY YOUR VENDORS AND AGAIN THESE HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED LICENSED FOLKS IT CAN'T JUST BE ANYBODY PLAN AROUND. AND YOUR VENDORS SO NOW I'M A PLUMBER INSTEAD I GETTING TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MY PERSON GOES OUT PUTS THE PIPES AND WATER THE PLANTS THEY GET A CHECK. IT'S A BETTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THIRD. IT'S TO BE USED TO INVESTMENT IN THE STATE WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE LOCAL INVESTMENTS OF OUR MAKE RETURN ON MY MONEY. I DO THAT AND FOURTH WE MOST IMPORTANCE TO PAY -- GOVERNMENT FEES SO THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ALL THIS HEARTACHE IN EXPENSE AND BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS WITH RESPECT -- TO COLLECTING MONEY THEY CAN ACCEPT THESE CHECKS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ACCEPT IT IF THEY WANT TO IT'S NOT A PERFECT APPROACH. A CERTAIN IS A LOT OF HOLES IN IT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WANT TO GO FARTHER IN THIS AND THAT THE IDEA IN OUR DISCUSSIONS THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE TREASURES OFFICER THEN THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS OFFICE. WAS HOW CAN WE AT LEAST TAKE A STEP THAT WILL PROVIDE SECURITY ALLOW FOR PEOPLE TO EASILY PAY THEIR TAXES OR OTHER FEES. AND AND THE UP THE ULTIMATE GATE THE DITCH DIGGERS ME TWO MORE QUICK POINTS ON RACE POINT NUMBER ONE IS THE LAST TWO POINTS ARE ARE. ONE IS THE IDEA THAT THIS WILL BE EASY TO TRANSFER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS ONCE THIS BECOMES LEGAL THE BIG CODES ARE GOING TO COME IN AND BUY THESE PEOPLE UP. AND IT'S REALLY EASY TO BUY THEM UP BECAUSE THEY LOOK LIKE SMELL LIKE BANKS RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO BUY THE ACCOUNTS. SECOND THING IS HOW TO BANKS MAKE MONEY. THEY TAKE MISTER OBERNOLTE IS A SMALL BANK ACCOUNT AND THEY THEY GET TAKE IS A THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN THEY LANDED THAT AT ANY GIVEN 1% INTEREST THEY LET IT OUT TO SOMEBODY ELSE 48% INTEREST THEY MAKE THE 7% THEY PAY EXPENSES TO MAKE A PROFIT. THIS WILL BE A LANDING IN THIS BANK WE CALL THE BANK IT'S REALLY A FEE FOR SERVICE SO NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN GIPSON CHARGES ME. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO KEEP AN ACCOUNT IS BANK AND EVERY CHECK THAT ARE RIGHT DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT OF THE CHECK. HE CHARGED ME A HUNDRED DOLLARS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS CHECK WITH THAT'S A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND A LOT MORE SAFE AND SECURE. THEN WHAT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IS. WE'RE TRYING IN GOVERNMENT TO AT LEAST TRY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AND WE WERE FACED WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE HOW DO WE AT LEAST IN GOOD FAITH SHOW TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THIS TREMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO DO THIS THING. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE COME BEFORE US THEIR ACTION FORMING THESE BANKS TO MAKE COST TEN MILLION BUCKS TO FORM ALL OF I FIGURE IT OUT. BUT IT IS A IT IS IN MY JUDGMENT A THOUGHTFUL SO INTERIM SOLUTION AS WE FACE IS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE BETWEEN THE TENSION BUT WHAT THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TOLD US THEY WANT. AND WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS IMPOSED IN THE LAW WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. FOR THEIR BRILLIANCE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CASEY O'CONNOR LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE TREASURER FIONA MA. I WAS THE TREASURES LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AS WELL AND THE AGENCY HAD BEEN COLLECTING SALES AND USE TAX PAYMENTS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX UP UNTIL RECENTLY ONE CD TFA TOOK OVER THAT RESPONSIBILITY WHEN ENTITIES WERE SPLIT -- UNLIKE MOST BUSINESSES CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARRIVE TO OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICES WITH DUFFEL BAGS FULL OF CASH TO FILL THEIR TAX OBLIGATIONS STANDARD OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES LIKE AUDITS BECAME VERY DIFFICULT FOR US WHEN MOST TRANSACTIONS ARE COMPLETED IN CASH. CONDITIONALLY THESE BUSINESSES FACE SECURITY RESTS BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF CASH IN THEIR POSSESSION SO WE SAW AND HEARD FIRST HAND HORROR STORIES FROM MEMBERS OF OUR BE A WE DISTRICT. PEOPLE THAT WERE RUN OFF THE ROADS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT BY ONLY OVERTAKEN BECAUSE EVERYONE KNOWS THIS INDUSTRY OPERATES IN CASH THEY KNOW WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THEIR TAX PAYMENTS. AND THEY WOULD SHOW UP TO OUR OFFICES IN TO BE PRETTY DEVASTATING TO HEAR THE STORIES. AND THE CHARGES WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THIS -- PROCESS NOW TO FIND A VIABLE WAY TO BANK THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND WE BELIEVE SB FIFTY ONE IS A NECESSARY REAL SOLUTION TO GET THE CASH OFF THE STREETS NOW. HEIGHTENED PUBLIC SAFETY AND INCREASE THE TAX COLLECTION AND TRANSPARENT AUDITING OF THE MONIES IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY INTO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE I'LL SEE THE REST OF MY TIME TO SEE CA THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ANY FRANK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS TO GIVE A QUICK INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS -- AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED -- ARE COMPLAIN CANNABIS INDUSTRY BRINGS IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. EACH QUARTER -- HOWEVER WE'VE BEEN SHUT OUT OF THE MAKING SUSHI -- SYSTEM THIS CREATES NOT ONLY MONETARY ISSUES BUT SOME SEVERE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES FOR OUR MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES -- TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE A MEMBER COMPANY THAT WAS FORCED TO TRANSPORT UP TO MILLION DOLLARS EACH MONTH IN CASH. WHAT THIS TO THAT THAT CDFA REGIONAL OFFICE IN SANTA ROSA WHAT THIS MEANT WAS THAT THEY SPEND ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY -- IN STAFFING AND TRANSPORT FEES AND THAT'S NOT TO MENTION THE FEES RELATED TO CASHIERS CHECKS AND WHATNOT SO A BIG MONETARY AND PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE ON INDUSTRY. HIS OFFENSE ALSO FOR OURSELVES -- WE ACTUALLY IS THE ASSOCIATION HAVE HAD. BANKING ISSUES WE ACTUALLY RECENTLY HAD OUR PACK ACCOUNT SHUT DOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE THE NAME CANNABIS IS IN IT -- SO THIS IS AN EMBARRASSING AND FRUSTRATING ISSUE FOR FOR US WHO DOESN'T WE DON'T DEAL WITH ANY SORT OF CANNABIS BUSINESS ITSELF IT IS TO TRADE ASSOCIATION -- SO FOR THESE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS WERE IN PRAGUE TO PART OF THIS BILL AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT NAY MANY AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO.

AND THIS CHAIRMAN PERMISSION TO HAND OUT A A ARTICLE FROM THE LOS ANGELES TIMES AND THEN A PICTURE OF SOME OF THESE CANISTERS. PLEASE YES AND THEN WHILE YOU'RE HANDLES OUT AYE IF YOU CAN KILEY ESTABLISH A QUORUM SO MANY CENTER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL LOW [inaudible] BROWN'S [inaudible] BLOOM. ARAMBULA. CHEN. CHIU CUNNINGHAM EGGMAN. ALL GIPSON. GLORIA. GRAYSON. HOLDEN IRWIN MCCARTY MEDINA MULLIN OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE HERE TING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANDERSON WE'VE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM. THIS CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO MEET WITH ME AND YOUR STAFF WORKING WITH MY OWN STAFF. THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED UNDER THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WE'RE TRYING HERE TO DEAL WITH IN SMOKE SHOPS. IT PROHIBITS RETAILERS OF TOBACCO OR TOBACCO RELATED PRODUCTS THESE ARE CALLED SMOKE SHOP YOUR HEAD SHOPS. FROM SELLING NITROUS OXIDE CANISTERS. NITROUS OXIDE HAS A USEFUL PURPOSE IN A VERY CONTROLLED CIRCUMSTANCE. USED IN FOR EXAMPLE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE. BUT IT HAS A DANGEROUS USE AS WELL. THE CANISTERS ARE SOLD WITH THE CRACKER WHICH IS A DEVICE USED TO INGEST. SMOKE. AND THAT IS ADOPTED. TO BE ABLE TO ATTACH THIS CANISTER. WHICH THAT INDIVIDUAL CAN THEN DIRECTLY INGEST. THIS NITROUS OXIDE. THE STREET NAME OF THIS IS WHAT. IT'S USED TO INHALE THIS DANGEROUS. BUT ALTHOUGH HELPFUL. JUST SOME UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. IN MANY CASES IT'S VERY DANGEROUS AS A WITNESS WILL SURELY INDICATE. THEY'RE NOT COMMONLY KNOWN THESE DANGERS. AND THESE CANISTERS IN THE ADAPTERS ARE VERY READILY AVAILABLE THAT SMOKE SHOPS IT PROLIFERATE IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND PEOPLE WHO GO WHEN THEY'RE PROBABLY DON'T KNOW MOST OF THEM DON'T KNOW. THAT THESE CANISTERS ARE AVAILABLE. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO USE THE NITROUS OXIDE THOUGH THEY DO FIND [inaudible] THE SUPPLY. A VERY CONVENIENT [inaudible] SUPPLY. NOW THE INDIVIDUALS CAN. ACCESS THESE CANISTERS FROM OTHER SOURCES. WE KNOW THAT. BUT YOU CAN'T CUT OFF EVERY SOURCE BUT MUCH THE GOAL OF THE BILL IS. SINCE THE SMOKE SHOPS ARE SO. EVIDENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. TO SIMPLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY OUR YOUTH. TO HAVE ACCESS. I AM INFORMED THAT THIS DOCTOR'S OXIDE HIGH IS A VERY BRIEF HIGH. AND IT REQUIRES CONTINUAL NURTURING. THE EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS THAT INDIVIDUALS TAKE. HAZARDS THEIR HEALTH. ALL THE MORE. IT REPLACES NIGHT NOT OXYGEN IN THE BRAIN AND DAMAGES TO BRING. INDIVIDUALS OF DIED. AND BEEN CRIPPLED. IT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN STANDARD DRUG TESTS. IT IS AFFECTING. I BELIEVE A LOT OF OUR CITIZENS. AND THE MOST VULNERABLE. ONE OF MY STAFF. WANTED TO HAVE A CHOIR. THE CANISTER. TO SHOW IN COMMITTEE. SHE WENT TO THE HAVE. A SMOKE SHOP. AND REQUESTED A CANISTER. AND I BELIEVE IT'S PERMISSION TO SHOW THAT CANISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN. IT'S JUST A LITTLE GREEN THING RIGHT HERE. AND IT WAS INTERESTING. THE PERSON JUST. WIPED OUT A BOX. AND IT ACROSS THE COUNTER. SHE SAID DON'T YOU REQUIRE ANY MORE INFORMATION. FOR ME NOW. EXCEPT DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY MORE. DON'T YOU WANT TO BUY MORE. WELL THAT'S TROUBLING BECAUSE THAT INDIVIDUAL. OBVIOUSLY WANTED TO SELL MORE. BUT WHAT HE ALSO KNEW. IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. A CHOIR AMPLE SUPPLIES OF THE SAYING SO THEY CAN SUSTAIN. THEY'RE VERY TEMPORARY HICE. I'D LIKE. TO INTRODUCE TO YOU TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BARBARA WATCH FOR SOME TESTIMONY. RELATING HER VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. AND ONE THAT I FEAR FOR TOO MANY OTHER [inaudible] CALIFORNIANS. AND AMERICANS. ARE EXPERIENCING BARBARA THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR. HI GOOD MORNING -- CAN YOU HEAR ME YEAH. MY NAME IS BARBARA LARGE I'M A NATIVE OF LOS ANGELES LIVING IN WEST LA. I'M AN ATTORNEY A WRITER A MOTHER OF TWO ADULT CHILDREN. I AM HERE BECAUSE MY TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD SON SUSTAINED BRAIN DAMAGE FROM A SEVERE ADDICTION TO NITROUS OXIDE. WHICH HE FED BY REGULARLY PURCHASING HUNDREDS OF CANISTERS FROM SMOKING TOBACCO SHOPS ACROSS LA. HUFFING OR INHALING NITROUS IS ADDICTIVE AND BECAME MY SON'S DRUG OF CHOICE. WHILE HE RESIDED IN A SOBER LIVING. A ROOMMATE INTRODUCED IT TO HIM AS A WELL KNOWN OPTION FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GET HIGH WITHOUT GETTING CAUGHT. ONCE KIDS IN SOBER LIVINGS ARE ABLE TO LEAVE THE PREMISES. MANY GO DIRECTLY TO LOCAL SMOKE SHOPS TO BUY WEAPONS BECAUSE THAT DRUG IS 1100% UNDETECTABLE ON DRUG TESTS. THESE KIDS CAN'T BUY IT ONLINE OR HAVE IT DELIVERED BECAUSE ALL DELIVERIES IN PACKAGES ARE SEARCHED BY STAFF AT SOBER LIVINGS OUR PARENTS. SO THEIR ONLY OPTION IS TO GO BUY THIS PRODUCT FACE TO FACE IN THE STORES. AND THIS SOON BECAME MY SON'S DRUG OF CHOICE. PEOPLE DESCRIBE THE HIGH FROM HAVING NITROUS AS THIRTY SECONDS OF ABSOLUTE BLISS. WHAT THAT EUPHORIA REALLY IS THOUGH IS BRAIN CELLS STARVING FOR OXYGEN? WHEN INHALED THE GAS DISPLACES ALL OF THE ON ALL THE OXYGEN IN THE LUNGS WHICH PRODUCES A SUDDEN DEPRIVATION OF OXYGEN TO THE BRAIN? THIS CAN CAUSE NOT ONLY BRAIN DAMAGE LIKE MY SON. BUT ALSO STROKES PARALYSIS HEART FAILURE AND DEATH FROM ASPHYXIATION. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE LOST HER BROTHER TO SUDDEN SNIFFING DEATH FROM HAVING NITROUS OXIDE. ON ONE OCCASION MY SON TURNED BLUE AND HAD TO BE SLAPPED BACK INTO CONSCIOUSNESS. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT THE DANGERS OF INHALING NITROUS EXTEND TO NON USERS AS WELL. MANY PEOPLE USE NITROUS AS SOON AS THEY BY IT MOST OFTEN IN PARKING LOTS BEHIND SMOKE SHOPS AND EVEN WHILE DRIVING. MY SON DESCRIBED THE ACTUAL PARKING LOT BEHIND HIS FAVORITE SMOKE SHOP AS BEING LITTERED WITH SPENT CANISTERS AND BALLOONS ALL OVER THE GROUND. HE ALSO ADMITTED TO HUFFING RIGHT THERE IN HIS CAR AND THEN DRIVING OFF. MOREOVER RECENT NEWS REPORTS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF FATAL CAR CRASHES WHERE THE DRIVERS HIGH ON NITROUS PASSED OUT BEHIND THE WHEEL. ONE SUCH FATAL TWENTY NINETEEN ACCIDENT INVOLVED A YOUNG MAN WHO DROVE HIS CAR STRAIGHT INTO A FAMILY OF FOUR WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. POLICE FOUND TWELVE USED CANISTERS OF NITROUS OXIDE INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG. A LONG WITH THEIR PURCHASE RECEIPT FROM A SMOKE SHOP. I RECENTLY PAID A LOCAL A VISIT TO MY LOCAL SMOKE SHOP TO SEE FOR MYSELF HOW EASY IT IS TO BUY THIS DRIVE AND HOW OWNERS AND EMPLOYEES FREELY SELL IT WITHOUT REGARD TO CONSEQUENCES. I'M GIVING A PARTY I LIED TO THE SALES PERSON DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED WITH ITS. HE POINTED TO A PLASTIC TUB BRIMMING WITH VIBRANT COLORED BALLOONS BOOKENDED BY BOXES OF WEAPONS. I SAW MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS SUCH AS SPECIAL BLUE MARKETED BY AN ANGRY FIRE BREATHING DRAGON. HERE'SA MATCHING DRAGON ON THIS THE CRACKER HERE. AND RADHIKA BRAND BOASTING A TOPLESS WOMAN WITH DOLLOPS OF WHIPPED CREAM ON HER BREASTS. THEN OF COURSE IN THE SMOKE SHOP THERE WAS THE ORIGINAL WHIPPET FEATURING A HAPPY HOMEMAKER FOR SHOWING OFFER DISPENSER. IN DRUG PARLANCE FOR CRACKER. ALL ALONG SIDE VAPE PENS VAPE DO CIGARETTES AND CANDIES. WHY WOULDN'T AN INDIVIDUAL COMING IN TO JUST BUY CIGARETTES THE ATTRACTED TO THESE DISTINCTIVE DISPLAYS? AND CONVINCE HIMSELF SPONTANEOUSLY CAN'T HURT TO TRY. IF YOU COULD KINDLY WRAP UP WITH REACHING FOR MINUTES. SORRY REACHING FOUR MINUTES IF YOU COULD KINDLY WRAP YOUR TESTIMONY OKAY. HOME OKAY ALTHOUGH MY SON HAS SINCE COMMITTED TO A LIFE OF SOBRIETY THE TRUTH IS ON ANY DAY OR NIGHT HE CAN WALK INTO ANY SMOKE SHOP. TO BUY VAPE USES SUDDENLY FIND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH EVERYTHING HE NEEDS TO RESUME HIS DEADLY ADDICTION TO NITROUS OXIDE. HE CAN EVEN SMELL THE ROBBERY LOWER OF THE BALLOONS WHICH IS INDEED TRIGGERING TO HAVE. IT WOULD BE LOGICAL FOR AIRPLANE GLUE PAINT THINNER AND THEIR ASSOCIATES YOU VERY MUCH CAN I JUST FINISH IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY IN THE STATE CAPITAL ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. CNN ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. DOCTOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS. HAS BEEN AS ONE OF THE HEAD. YOU OF SAID RECENT FROM FREQUENTLY WE MAKE IT HARD IN CALIFORNIA FOR SMALL BUSINESS -- TO TO TO MAKE IT -- IN LOVE THE SMALL PIECE IN OFFICE SMOKE SHOPS ARE MOM AND POP SHOPS -- SO THE SO THIS IS A LEGAL SOMETHING THAT IS SOLD. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS BECAUSE I JUST SAT HERE AND LOOKED IT UP. ON AMAZON. A AND I CAN HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO MY DOOR -- WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR TWENTY TWO NINETY NINE A PACK OF FIFTY SO IF WE BAN THEM. FROM BEING SOLD IN STORES. ISN'T ISN'T JUST IN THE EASIER THING TO DO FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER THEM ONLINE AND HAVE THE SAME. EASY ACCESS. WELL FIRST OF ALL THOSE COULD NOT THEN GO TO ANYONE WHO WAS IN A TREATMENT FACILITY IS A WITNESS TO TESTIFY. BUT THAT SAID. YES. THEY COULD GO ONLINE. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU CAN GET ONLINE THAT CAN BE VERY HARMFUL. MY POINT IN THIS IS SIMPLY TO MAKE IT LESS AVAILABLE. AND LESS AVAILABLE MEANS IN SMOKE SHOPS. THAT'S A SIMPLE FORMULA TO MAKE IT LESS AVAILABLE. MAKE THE NITROUS OXIDE LESS AVAILABLE. AND HOPEFULLY WAY PRESENTING THIS BILL AND INFORMATION AS WE HAVE TO THE COURSE OF CARRYING THIS BILL. INCREASE THE AWARENESS. OF FAMILIES BEEN VEGETABLES. OF THE DANGERS. OF NITROUS OXIDE. IT'S KIND OF A STEALTH. AFFLICTION RIGHT NOW AND THE PEOPLE KNOW MORE ABOUT IT. WE BELIEVE. THERE WILL BE LESS OF IT USED. MAY I ADD MAN I IS IT POSSIBLE TO ADD NO NOT NOT AT THIS TIME UNLESS IS A CRESCENT DIRECTLY AND MADE. TO HER QUESTION NO NO IT IN LESS THAT'S OKAY YEAH THERE IS. NO NOT AT THIS TIME ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THIS TIME [inaudible] MR BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- A SENATOR NIELSEN I I WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO CALL ATTENTION -- TO THIS ISSUE -- I'VE I BELIEVE IT'S ONE OF MANY INVOLVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I THINK -- FRANKLY -- WITH -- OF MOST OF THE CATEGORIES OF SUBSTANCES THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THAT ARE BEING ABUSED. WE'RE FIGHTING INCREMENTAL BATTLES. AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS ULTIMATELY IS THE SOLUTION. BUT AS YOU POINT OUT I THINK IT MAKES -- AND WOULD MAKE AN INCREMENTAL DIFFERENCE -- THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY OF CALLING ATTENTION PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE DANGERS OF THIS OTHERWISE SEEMINGLY. INNOCENT. PRACTICE AND AND YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK HERE BILLS A PANACEA I DON'T THINK YOU THINK IT'S BASS EITHER -- BUT IT ISN'T AN INCREMENTAL STEP IN A SUPPORT. IT WAS AN EYE OPENER ASSEMBLYMAN WHEN. BARBARA BROADER SON. AND I GOT TO SEE THE IMPACT ON ONE HUMAN BEING. THAT WAS SUFFICIENT. TO WHAT MY INTEREST AND PASSION ON THE SUBJECT MATTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. AND SEEING NONE THEN SEVEN IS A MAY I ASK YOU A SPECIFICALLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS ON THE NOTION THAT IF WE OF THEN HELP SUPPORT. SOME OF THESE PURCHASES TO THE NON. LICENSE -- ESTABLISHMENTS YEAH THIS IS IN TOBACCO SHOPS AND TOBACCO SHOPS AND ARE REGULATED MORE HEAVILY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THE QUESTION OF THE THOUGHT BEHIND INDIVIDUALS THEN GOING ELSEWHERE AND LESS REGULATED ENVIRONMENTS -- COULD THAT BE A CHALLENGE FOR US TO REALLY TACKLE THIS ISSUE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY COMMENTS WITH RESPECT THAT. WELL I THINK I DID COMMON THIS GERMAN JUST A BIT AGO. CERTAIN. IT'S AS EASY AS THE INTERNET. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. AND IT'S AN ARGUABLE THAT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SUN. WHAT THEY THEN SEEK OTHER SOURCES SURE? BUT WE ALSO HAD THE ADDITIONAL VALUE OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING. OF THE QUICK THE AVAILABILITY. IN OUR COMMUNITY EACH OF THIS. HOPEFULLY THEN TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM GOING TO INTERNET AND OR BLACK MARKET SOURCES. YOU BET YOU NEVER STOP THE BLACK MARKET SOURCES FOR WHATEVER. IT WILL BE THERE. BUT WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE [inaudible] PUBLIC AWARENESS. OF SOMETHING THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS. TO OUR SOCIETY. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NIELSEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. WELL MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING IT.

MISTER CHAIR I MEMBERS SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES VETERINARIANS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOMMEND THE USE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS FOR MEDICINAL USE ON THEIR ANIMAL PATIENTS. PADS OUR FURRY FRIENDS SUFFER FROM MANY OF THE SAME IF NOT SIMILAR ELEMENTS THAT HUMANS DO. AND WHICH MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT. SINCE VETERINARIANS ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED ON HOW THEY CAN DISCUSS THE USE OF MEDICAL CANNABIS PRODUCTS LET ALONE PROVIDE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS ON DOSAGE OR APPLICATION OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS. PET OWNERS WOULD LIKE TO TREAT THEIR ANIMALS OFTEN TO TURN TO THE INTERNET FOR ADVICE OR SIMPLY SEEK THE COUNSEL OF THE RETAIL CANNABIS CLERK. BEHIND THE COUNTER FOR RECOMMENDATIONS RATHER THAN GETTING THE ADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE MOST QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL THEIR LOCAL VETERINARIAN. PET OWNERS ARE AND INTENTIONALLY PUTTING THEIR PETS HEALTH AND SAFETY IN DANGER. ANIMAL CANADA. CANNABINOID RECEPTORS SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT FROM HUMANS SO DOSAGES MUST BE ADJUSTED FOR THE TYPE OF ANIMAL ITS WEIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY THE CONDITION YOU ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT ANIMALS PROVIDE FOR THE SAFE USE OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND TO ALLOW THOSE VETERINARIANS WHO WISH TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION. ON CANNABIS USE I'VE AUTHORED SB SIX TWENTY SEVEN MY STAFF HAS WORKED WITH COMMITTEE STAFF ON A NUMBER OF CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. CERTAINLY WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS ALONG WITH TOP TOUGH COMPROMISES ON THIS MEASURE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS EFFORT AND ALL THE WORK WITH THE KIDS COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS AS WELL.

EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD. AND WE OPPOSE SB SIX TO SEVEN WE DID OPPOSE IT BACK IN APRIL FOR THE VERY REASONS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE TAKING MANY OTHER MOMENTS BUT SOME OF OUR CONCERNS STILL STAND. AND I WANTED THE AUTHORS OFFICE THE BOARDING KNOWLEDGE THAT CANNABIS AND CANVAS PRODUCTS MAY HAVE POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS ANIMALS. HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR FUNDING FOR CAMPUS RESEARCH SO THAT AN AREA AND AND THE PUBLIC ARE INFORMED ON THE POSSIBLE EFFECTIVE USE OF CANNABIS TO TREAT ANIMALS. AND ENSURE THE FULL PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS AND THEIR ANIMALS. MOTHER MEDICATIONS AND LEADERS TRUCKS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO ANIMAL PATIENTS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH. THOSE WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS SCHEDULED ONE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE **** CANNABIS. IN ADDITION THERE SEEMS TO BE A MUST COME TO THE MENTOR MEDICAL FOR CAN DEVELOP GUIDELINES IS THE WAY THE MEDICAL BOARD CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED THERE. HOWEVER BY THE TIME THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA WAS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THEIR GUIDELINES. CMC ARE ALREADY HAD OVER A DECADE'S WORTH OF RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF CANNABIS IN HUMANS AND NBC WAS ABLE TO RELY HEAVILY ON AND NEAR THE MAJORITY OF THE GUIDELINES ALREADY DEVELOPED. BY THEIR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION BY OF REGULATORY BOARDS. THAT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE FOR OUR BOARD. AS THE THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THE MC ARE HAS PERFORMED NO RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF CANNABIS FOR ANIMALS AND OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION RENTAL FOR HAVE NO SUCH GUIDELINES TO RELY ON IN FACT THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION BATTERIES THE BOARD MEETING OF SIXTY TWO JURISDICTIONS. INCLUDING ALL THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES IS RELYING ON OUR BOARD STRAPPED GUIDELINES FOR DISCUSSING CANNABIS. AB SB WOULD CERTAINLY FOLLOW OUR LEAD ON GUIDELINES FOR RECOMMENDED CANNABIS. IF THIS BILL IS PASSED IN THE PORT IS PORT OR SORRY. IF THE BILL IS PASSED IN THE IN IS FORCED TO DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR RECOMMENDED CANNABIS WITHOUT ANY RESEARCHER MEANINGFUL ASSISTANCE PLEASE CONSIDER THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THIS WILL HAVE ON ANIMALS. AND DINNER IS A CALIFORNIA THIS NATION AND THE SUBSEQUENT COUNTRIES TO FOLLOW. RESEARCH MUST BE DONE AND NECESSARY FUNDS MUST BE PROVIDED IT IS ONLY THEN THAT THE SPORT CAN DEVELOP EFFECTIVE AND MEANINGFUL GUIDELINES FOR DEPENDENT MEANS TO USE WOULD RECOMMEND CANNABIS BUT ANIMAL PATIENTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE JOURNAL ABOUT THANK YOU. CONDITIONALLY THIS IS AN UP MY NAME IS GOING TO GET ON THE FOR THE PHYSICIAN FROM FRESNO CALIFORNIA AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON THE STATE. IT ESSENTIALLY WOULD DONE THE STATE BANKRUPT IN ORDER TO SET UP THEIR OWN BE A FOR VETERINARY SPECIES. TO CHECK THE DIVERSION INTO THE HUMAN SPECIES.

AND WE REALLY NEEDED BUT THIS BILL HIDE INITIALLY SAID SIX YEARS CAN BE SUPERVISED BY POSITION I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HAGGLING HAPPEN THAT NUMBER WAS REDUCED. TO FOUR AT SOME POINT. SO I THINK THE NUMBER SHOULD BE CHANGED FOR BASED ON THE NEED IN THE VALLEY WE NEED MORE BE IS TO BE THERE THE NUMBER SHOULD BE CHANGED BACK. TO SIX THE SECOND THING I WANT TO TELL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS TO LOOK AT AB THREE FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND CONTRAST THIS BILL WITH THAT. BECAUSE AB TWO THOUSAND SEVEN CREATED AN OPIATE CRISIS IN THIS STATE. THEY'RE A BUNCH OF OTHER OF PROVISIONS I WOULD WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE RETROACTIVE -- AFFECTED PROVISIONS IN SECTION JACKSON FIVE HAVE NOT BEEN DELETED YET THOUGHT AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT THE VIOLATIONS OF THE EXISTING LAW IN EFFECT UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WILL BE IN FOR SUPPORTER EXISTING LAWS. THAT IS BASED IN LINE FIFTEEN TO SIXTEEN PAGE. TEN LINE FORTY TWO PAGE ELEVEN LING. TO THE REFERENCE TO PRACTICE ADMINISTRATORS HAS NOT BEEN REMOVED CLARIFIED AMENDED TO REFLECT RESTRICTIONS ON UNLICENSED PRACTICE ADMINISTRATORS WHICH REMAIN MY GREATEST WORRY PAGE FIVE LINE. TWENTY TWO TO TWENTY FOUR LANGUAGE ADDITIONS TO REFLECT IN THE AMENDMENT FOR BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. CODE -- TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED AT THE END OF PARAGRAPH ARE INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE THESE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; --&lt;/c&gt;</u> PRACTICE SEGMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE DRAFTED BY UNLESS UNLICENSED PERSON AND ENFORCED BY UNLICENSED PERSON. ON THEN THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WHO IS ACTUALLY THE GUY DESIGNATED TO SUPERVISE THE P. IT SHOULD HAVE SOME DEGREE OF SAFETY AND DROPPING ORDER AMENDING THE CONTENT OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE PRACTICE. AGREEMENT IF HE SO DESIRES WITHIN THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION FIVE BEGINNING THREE FIVE ZERO TWO POINT THREE BUT SPECIFICALLY PAGE. NINE LINES THIRTY SIX TO FORTY AND PAGE TEN LINES. ELEVEN TO FOURTEEN POSITION ASSISTANT MUST AND I'D BUY UNDERSCORED THAT TOWARD POSITION ASSISTANT MUST BE DESIGNATED AS AN AGENT. OF THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN. PAGE TEN LINE EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN THANK YOU. YOU MAY WISH TO SUMMARIZE DR. NO DO YOU WISH TO SUMMARIZE YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER IT WHEN THE SUSPICION TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION THIS AMENDMENT WOULD CLEAR THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TALK TO GO AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE WAS HE TALKED TO US BEING COMING UP IN. A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS WILL PROVIDE A TESTIMONY FOR THE BOARD AND OTHERS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION SO -- PLEASE FEEL FREE PRESENT WHEN YOU'RE READY. AB MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TIM AND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMEND A POSITION WE JUST WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR TIME AND LISTENING TO OUR CONCERNS OUR CONCERNS ARE CENTERED AROUND. ENSURING THAT THE PHYSICIAN AND SUPERVISING THE PA HAS THE SAME PRIVILEGES TO BE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OUR CONCERN IS A POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE A PHYSICIAN. WHO IS SUPERVISING A PA IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT -- WHO DOESN'T HAVE PRIVILEGES IN THAT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PHYSICIANS WHO ARE ON CALL THE CARDIOLOGISTS FOR EXAMPLE? WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE A CARDIOLOGISTS SUPERVISING A PA IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING WHO THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN IS -- IN OUR EXPERIENCE WHEN IT COMES TO MALPRACTICE SUITS -- THE ATTORNEYS WILL TRY AND CAPTURE AS MANY POSITIONS AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHO THE SUPERVISING POSITION IS WE THINK THIS WILL LEAD -- TO UNNECESSARY -- IDENTIFICATION OF PHYSICIANS PULLED INTO THAT PROCESS HI WERE ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LOW AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JED GRANT I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOREDOM A PA PRACTICED EMERGENCY MEDICINE FOR TWENTY YEARS. OF A COMPANY BY XAVIER MARTINEZ WHO IS A PUBLIC MEMBER OF THE BOARD AS WELL AS SUPPORT STAFF AND COUNCIL. I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF POSITION ASSISTANCE THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND CENTER CAL EURO FOR TAKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND FOR WORKING WITH US TO TRY AND RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. I AGREE WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT IF YOU BUT SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC PROTECTION PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL CAN BE RESOLVED. THE AUTHOR STRESSES THE IMPORTANT ACCESS TO CARE THAT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW AND WE AGREE HOWEVER THE POPULATION THIS BILL WILL SERVICE VULNERABLE AND NEEDS PROTECTION. THE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT BOARD HAS FOUR MAIN CONCERNS WITH SB SIX NINETY SEVEN THE FIRST BEING SUPERVISION. THIS BILL ALLOWS A PA TO PRACTICE OUTSIDE THE SPECIALTY OR USUAL AND CUSTOMARY PRACTICE OF THE SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WHICH IS IN EFFECT UNSUPERVISED PRACTICE SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNED. JUST REYES BY KELLY SAID. THE TRAINING IS GENERAL IN NATURE WHICH ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY IN ABILITY TO CHANGE MEDICAL SPECIALTY HOWEVER IS NOT TO THE DEPTH OF A RESIDENCY TRAINED PHYSICIAN. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THE FOURTH YEAR OF MEDICAL SCHOOL PHYSICIANS TAKE STEP TO THE UNITED STATES MEDICAL LICENSURE EXAMINATION BUT HAVE NOT YET COMPLETED RESIDENCY TRAINING AND HAVE VERY SIMILAR -- LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE IS A NEW PA GRADUATE. RECOGNIZING THIS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD RECENTLY ENACTED LEGISLATION TO GRANT A RESTRICTED LICENSE TO PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE THIS SIMILAR LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE TO PA'S WHICH ALLOWS HIM TO PRACTICE SUPERVISED UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF RESIDENCY. ADDITIONALLY THE MEDICAL BOARD PASSED REGULATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR REQUIRING SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS PRACTICE IN THE SAME. SPECIALTY OR USUAL AND CUSTOMARY PRACTICE THE PUBLIC NEEDS US PROTECTION WHICH MAY BE REMOVED BY THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR TIMES WHEN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE POSITION MAY BE REQUIRED BECAUSE IT DEFINES SUPERVISION IS SPECIFICALLY NOT REQUIRING THE PRESENCE OF THE PHYSICIAN. THEIR TIME SUCH AS DURING SURGERY OR IN CASES INVOLVING DISCIPLINE WHEN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE POSITION MAY BE REQUIRED. WE FEEL THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS THIS PROTECTION WHICH MAY BE REMOVED BY THE BILL. NUMBER TWO THE BILL REMOVES -- PHYSICIAN SYSTEM BOARDS OF FORTY TO MAKE REGULATIONS MEDICINE IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING OUR HAS ARE THE LAWS RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF MEDICAL PRACTICE. THE P. BOARD NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO CRAFT REGULATIONS TO ALLOW FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LAWS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS TO ALLOW FOR CHANGES IN THE CLINICAL PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT. NOTABLY WE HAVE SEVERAL REGULATIONS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING APPROVED INCLUDING BILL INTRODUCED BY CHAIRMAN LOW LAST YEAR WHICH WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. WHICH FREEZES PA BE REGULATORY AUTHORITY ON JUNE SEVENTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER BOARD OF YOUR OWN APARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND HAS SUCH STRICT CONEY AND RESTRICTIONS NOR WHY SUCH RESTRICTIONS WOULD BE NEEDED. NUMBER THREE I NECESSARY CHANGES COMING UP FOR US PLEASE. SO THERE ARE SOME CHANGES TO PRESCRIBING LAWS THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH AS WELL AS ALLOWING UNLICENSED PERSONS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SCOPE AND DEFINITION OF DUTIES OF THE PA. WE DO. APPRECIATE THE COOPERATION WE'VE HAD FROM THE AUTHOR AND SPA -- SPONSORS AND WE ANTICIPATE WORKING WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK BRIEFLY IN OPPOSITION MR MEMBERS TO MATT AND MARK FROM ALSO REPRESENTS THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF PLASTIC SURGEONS AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA RHEUMATOLOGY ALLIANCE YOU ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE LISTEN IN A POSITION.

THANK YOU AND I I'LL START BY THANKING YOU SENATOR COMING AT ALL I KNOW YOUR PASSION AND COMMITMENT. TO INCREASING ACCESS IN PLACES LIKE THE VALLEY IN THE CENTRAL COAST AND THIS BILL GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS TRYING TO ADDRESS IT. I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE OPPOSITION FROM THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS. PARTICULARLY REGARDING SUPERVISION. AND HOW WE ENSURE THAT. MANY PHYSICIANS DON'T GET INCLUDED INTO SUPERVISING IF THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE. DOING ON OUR SHIPS HOW DO WE ALLOW PHYSICIANS' ASSISTANCE TO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS THAT NURSE PRACTITIONERS HAVE. WHILE STILL INSURING THAT SUPERVISION IS THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA -- THIS -- PROCESS HAS ENCOURAGED. THERE'S A STAKEHOLDERS GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN MEETING -- THESE ISSUES ON AT THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE EMERGENCY ROOM WORKING ON IN TERMS OF LANGUAGE WE JUST COULDN'T GET THE LANGUAGE. BACK FROM LEDGE COUNCIL IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEADLINE OF OF THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE BUT WERE VERY SENSITIVE TO IT WE'VE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO WORK ON THE LANGUAGE MAKE SURE -- THAT NUMBER ONE THAT WERE IDENTIFYING THE SUPERVISOR WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND NUMBER TWO THAT THAT. THAT THEY THAT THE SUPERVISOR HAVE THIS THE SAME MEDICAL TRAINING AT THAT THE PA HAS -- WEEK WE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND I THINK IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED I WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE WORKING ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SIX TO FOUR RATIO. THAT. INITIALLY THE BILL -- HAD A HAD THE SIX PA'S. TO TWO A DOCTOR THAT SUPERVISING AND DOCTOR PAN HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF AUTHORITY TO SAY THAT IT'S IT'S ADEQUATE SUPERVISION TO HAVE SIX UNDER SO WE INDIFFERENCE TO DOCTOR PAN. MADE IT THE ORIGINAL FOR AND SO THAT THAT WE'RE NOT CONTEMPLATING. BUT OTHERWISE -- ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE OF THE ISSUES ARE ARE BEING DISCUSSED AND WE'RE WORKING ON LANGUAGE AS WE SPEAK. THEN THREE YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIVE MAY WITH THE AUTHOR'S INTENT ON WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL ONE APPROPRIATE. WILD.

LIKEWISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CLUB OF NATURE. MEMBERS WORK THEN JUST WAITING FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO AUTHORS THAT WE HAVE LEFT THAT'S FILE ITEM NO THREE SB TO SEND FIVE BY DOCTOR PAN. AND FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE WHICH IS SB SIX SEVEN NINE BY SENATOR BATES OKAY MEMBERS WILL THEN MOVE ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE SB TO SEND A FIVE BY DOCTOR PENS. WELCOME -- THANK YOU. MY WITNESSES COME [inaudible] CHECK AGAIN. OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- TODAY A BRING YOU SB TWO SEVENTY FIVE THE BILL SPONSORED BY THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY WHICH ADD SEXUAL BEHAVIOR WHICH INCLUDES AN APPROPRIATE ACTIONS IN COMMUNICATIONS OF A SEXUAL NATURE. THEIR PRECURSOR TO OURS HARMFUL. AS SEXUAL CONTACT WITH A CLIENT OR FORMER CLIENT TO THE LIST OF VIOLATIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE IN MINISTRY. LARGE LAW JUDGES PROPOSED DECISION TO INCLUDE AN ORDER REVOCATION OF LICENSE. CURRENT LAW THE FIND SEXUAL CONTACT IS MEETING QUOTE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE OR THE TOUCHING OF AN INTIMATE PART OF THE PATIENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEXUAL AROUSAL GRATIFICATION -- ABUSE UNQUOTE. ADDITIONALLY CURRENT LAW DEFINES AN INTIMATE PART AS QUOTE THE SEXUAL ORGAN ****. GROWING OR PRODUCTS OF ANY PERSON AND THE BREAST OF A FEMALE UNQUOTE. THEREFORE YOU COULD ACTUALLY LICKED THE NIPPLE OF THE MALE PATIENT AND THAT WOULD NOT MEET THIS DEFINITION. WHICH IS CLEARLY OUTDATED. THIS IS FAR TOO NARROW THE DEFINITION HAS CAN AND HAS CREATED SITUATIONS WHERE THE BOARD HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REVOKE THE LICENSES OF PSYCHOLOGISTS. WHO HAVE HAD INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT? IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS ALL BUT ONE ALL BUT ONE OF THE CASES THAT WENT BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WERE UNABLE TO RESULT IN A REVOCATION. DUE TO THIS OUTDATED NARROW DEFINITION. SO SB TWO SEVENTY FIVE WITH THE FIND SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AS QUOTE INAPPROPRIATE CONTACT THE COMMUNICATION OF A SEXUAL NATURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEXUAL AROUSAL GRATIFICATION EXPLOITATION FOR ABUSE. SEXUAL BEHAVIOR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE PROVISION OF APPROPRIATE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS RELATED TO SEXUAL ISSUES ON QUOTE. THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY WANTS TO ENSURE THAT SEXUAL BEHAVIOR WITH A CLIENT EVEN IF IT HAS NOT ACTUALLY RESULTED IN ACTUAL INTERCOURSE TO SEXUAL CONTACT CONTACT. IS AN EGREGIOUS ETHICAL VIOLATION THAT MERITS THE HIGHEST LEVEL DISCIPLINE. AND THE REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY HAS EXPERIENCED CASES INVOLVING INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONTACT THAT THAT THAT DID NOT MEET THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF SEXUAL CONTACT. AND THEREFORE DID NOT REQUIRED THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO RECOMMEND WROTE REVOKING THE LICENSE. SO SOME EXAMPLES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIORS THAT THE BOARD HAS SEEN AND DISCIPLINARY CASES THAT DID NOT REACH THE LEVEL OF SEXUAL CONTACT INCLUDE. KISSING A CLIENT. TOUCHING EXPOSING ONESELF AND APPROPRIATELY. SO WHICH MEANS THAT A PSYCHOLOGIST COULD ACTUALLY **** AND FROM THEIR PATIENT. AND THE BOARD WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REVOKE THE LICENSE. SENDING FLIRTATIOUS SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE EXPLICIT TAX. MESSAGES OR EMAILS TO CLIENTS. SETTING THE CLIENTS PHOTOS INCLUDE NUDITY THE GENITALIA GENERAL'S SEXUALLY SUGGESTIVE POSES. AND WE KNOW TECHNOLOGISTS CHANGE WE NEED THE ALSO UPDATE THE CODE ADDRESS SEXTING. OUR BY ROMANTIC OR SEXUAL GIFTS FOR A CLIENT SO I GUESS YOU CAN SEND SOMEONE SEX TOY THAT WOULD NOT VIOLATE THE COAT. SB TWO SEVENTY FIVE WOULD MAKE THIS CLEAR UNDER THE LAW THAT THESE SEXUAL CAUGHT BEHAVIORS WITH A CLIENT OUR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND I HOPE EVERYONE HERE CAN AGREE. THAT SHOULD BE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. SEXUAL BEHAVIOR IN THIS I CAUGHT PSYCHOTHERAPIST CLIENT RELATIONSHIP BY A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL IS AN ETHICAL VIOLATION. AS IT VIOLATES A DUTY OF CARE INHERENT IN A THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP. AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU GO SEEK HELP FROM A FROM A PSYCHOLOGIST. YOU KNOW YOU YOU GO IN THERE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LEVEL OF TRUST BUT ALSO LEVEL VULNERABILITY BECAUSE IN PART OF THE THEIR PEAK RELATIONSHIP YOU -- EXPECTED TO I EXPECTED TO I MEAN IN ORDER TO GET THE TREATMENT YOU NEED. SHARE SOME OF YOUR MOST INTIMATE NO ANXIETIES FEARS AND COLLUDING ONES THAT ARE SEXUAL YOU ARE IN A VULNERABLE POSITION. THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST CLIENT RELATIONSHIP IS UNIQUE TO YOUR STEERING SOME THE MOST INTIMATE PARTS OF YOUR PSYCHE. YOU TALK TO YOUR THERAPIST ABOUT THINGS YOU DON'T TALK TO ANYONE ELSE. EVEN A SPOUSE OR SIGNIFICANT OTHER -- FAMILY MEMBER. THAT CREATES A POWER DYNAMIC THAT SHOULD NOT BE EXPLOITED. NOW THE WELL THE BOARD HAS DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ADDRESS PROSECUTE YOUR PROSECUTORIAL ROLE. THE BOARD BELIEVES THAT INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THE CLIENT BEYOND SEXUAL CONTACT IS SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND SHOULD BE PROSECUTED JUDICATA SUCH. WE MUST GIVE THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS IN PLACE THE POWER TO STOP SEXUAL PREDATORS AND PREVENT THEM FROM CONTINUING TO PRACTICE BY BEING ABLE TO REVOKE THE LICENSE. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY PRESIDENT. STEPHEN PHILLIPS WHO'S GOING TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE BOARD EXPERIENCE AND THE NEED FOR SB. TWO SEVENTY FIVE AND THEN I ALSO HAVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ANSON AT SOREK THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO ENSURE THAT WE DEAL WITH. WITH THIS VERY SERIOUS ISSUE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A FIGHT UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LOW -- VICE CHAIRMAN BRO AND HIS TEAM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DOCTOR STEPHEN PHILLIPS AND I COME TO YOU TODAY AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. THE BOARD IS PLEASED TO BE THE SPONSOR BEST BE TWO SEVENTY FIVE AND SINCERELY THANKS CENTER PAN FOR ALL THREE IN THIS BILL. IN THIS AGE OF OUR SENSITIVITY TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION BY PEOPLE IN A POSITION OF POWER. A REMEDY TO THE PROBLEMS OF WE'RE LOOKING AT IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT -- SOME MEMBERS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY PROVISION. BUT WITHOUT THE PROVISION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE ARE LEFT IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN ONLY ALLEGE THAT PEOPLE ENGAGE AND UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT. WHICH DOES NOT ALLOW US IN VIRTUALLY ANY CASE TO GET REVOCATION. SO WE'RE LEAVING SEXUAL PREDATORS. IN A POSITION WHERE THEY STILL HAVE A LICENSE TO PRACTICE PSYCHOLOGY AND SEE PATIENTS. VIOLATING THE TRUST OF A PATIENT IN THIS WAY IS PERHAPS THE MOST EGREGIOUS VIOLATION OF THE DUTY AND TRUSTED HIS REPOSE AND A PSYCHOLOGIST. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF A CASE IN WHICH THERE WAS PROBATION GIVEN RATHER THAN REVOCATION. THE PSYCHOLOGIST BEGAN SEEING A CLIENT AND FOR ANXIETY AND IN THE FIRST SESSION AS THE CLIENT IF SHE'S HAVING SEX AND HOW OFTEN. SCOTT PSYCHOLOGIST AND MADE SUBJECTIVE STATEMENTS THE CLIENT TOLD HER HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE WAS AND HOW ATTRACTIVE SHE WAS AND HOW LUCKY HER BOYFRIEND WAS. THE PSYCHOLOGIST TOLD THE CLIENT ABOUT ANOTHER CLIENT WHO SPREAD THEIR LEGS TO SHOW THEY HAVE NO PANTIES. AND SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS INTIMATE WITH HIS WIFE HE THOUGHT ABOUT. THEN THE RELATIONSHIP CHANGED THEY STARTED USING FAMILIAR NAMES AND HE WOULD PUT HIS HAND ARE BACK. THEY NO LONGER DISCUSS THERAPY AND BEGAN HOLDING HANDS KISSING ON THE FACE THE DEMIGOD SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER DURING SESSIONS. AND AT ONE POINT THE PATIENT'S STRADDLED THE THERAPIST ON THE COUCH. THERE WAS UNDRESSING INVOLVED. THE PSYCHOLOGIST REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PATIENT WITH NUDITY. THE PSYCHOLOGIST THREATEN THE CLIENT IF SHE SPOKE ABOUT BEHAVIOR. AND SHE SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME SUICIDAL. THE RESULT OF OUR PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM BECAUSE WE COULD NOT SEEK REVOCATION UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PSYCHOLOGIST RECEIVED PROBATION AND STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SEE PATIENTS. THIS TYPE OF OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR PARTICULARLY IN THE DIGITAL AGE. IS ONE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WE HAVE AN OUTDATED DEFINITION THAT NEEDS A MUCH BROADER SENSE SO THAT WE CAN STOP SEXUAL PREDATORS FROM USING THEIR CYCLE PSYCHOLOGIST LICENSE. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IN INSTALLATION IF YOU WISH TO DO SO [inaudible] PLEASE. HI MY NAME IS GONNA PUT UP SINGLE I'M A LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEN THEN ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEE NINE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM KEY MEMBERS AT THIS TIME DOCTOR EGGMAN. I THINK YOU THINK A DOCTOR PAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AND CERTAINLY THE THINGS THAT YOU DESCRIBED -- ARE NOT OKAY AND UNDER IN NO CONDITION THIS. THE THINGS YOU DESCRIBED ALRIGHT BUT I GUESS I'M WONDERING THAT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY -- CAN'T REVOKE SOMEBODY'S LICENSE BUT THE BNP CODE CLEARLY COVERS SEXUAL CONTACT THAT ANYBODY'S LICENSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MUST FOLLOW -- SO THE SECTIONS SAID. SEVEN TWENTY SIX AND SEVEN TWENTY NINE SEEM TO COVER ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING -- THAT AGAIN THE BORDER PSYCHOLOGY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMOVE SOMEBODY'S LYSONS BY THE BNP CODE WHICH GOVERNS -- SOMEBODY HAVING A VALID LICENSE THOSE THOSE POLICIES ALREADY IN PLACE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF PROTECTION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I MEAN IF YOU DO IF WE JUST GOING TO PSYCHOLOGIST I MEAN IS A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THERAPY LCSW -- AND HAVE TV'S POSITION PSYCHIATRISTS IF YOU WILL -- SO I SO I GUESS IS MY QUESTION IS IF THESE ARE ALREADY COVERED THE BNP CODE THAT THAT GO FOR ALL THE HELPING PROFESSIONS WHY DO WE NEED THIS SPECIAL. ONE JUST FOR PSYCHOLOGIST. NO I THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND AND I GUESS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD JUST SAY IS IS THAT -- IN RELATION -- TO IS THAT THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY AND I DON'T ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IT IS RESULTS THEIR BILL SO. AND AS YOU HEARD IN THE TESTIMONY HAD CHALLENGES ACTUALLY -- PROSECUTING BECAUSE THE THE SENSHI TO TWENTY GENERAL OFF THE OJ WITH WILL NOT REVOKE THE LICENSE BUT PERHAPS AND LET ME HAVE THAT FOR PSYCHOLOGY SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE CODE SECTIONS THAT YOU REFER TO KNOW WHY THEY CAN'T ACT. SO -- SEVEN TWENTY SIX I'M SORRY A THREE SPURS FOR PSYCHOLOGY -- SO DOES BMP SEVEN TWENTY SIX ACTUALLY ENDS YOU WITH PER UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT AND THE BOARD HAS HAD A HISTORY OF USING UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT FOR SEXUAL BEHAVIORS BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO SKATE REVOCATION FOR THAT. SO THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN OF COURSE USE UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT BUT YOU'RE GONNA END UP WITH THE PROBATION MAYBE FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS MAYBE SOME ETHICAL CLASSES CLASSES COURSES ABOUT BOUNDARIES -- BUT THEN YOU'RE AGAIN FREE AND CLEAR TO PRACTICE -- SO THERE. IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S FOR THE NINE CASES WE'VE SEEN OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET REVOCATION. FOR ALL OF THOSE END UP AN UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT THEY END UP IN PROBATION THEY END UP RIGHT BACK OUT THERE AND ABLE TO PRACTICE AND AGAIN WE'RE A CONSUMER COMPLAINT DRIVEN AGENCY. SO WE ONLY GET TO GO AFTER THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE GET THAT DOESN'T EVEN INCLUDE THOSE PATIENTS THAT HAVEN'T COME FORWARD THAT MAY HAVE ALSO BEEN EXPLOITED BY THESE THERAPISTS. SO. OUR ABILITY TO TAKE THAT EXTRA MEASURE USED TWENTY NINE SIXTY POINT ONE AND ARE PRESS THAT ARE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS PRACTICE ACT. THAT'S THE REVOCATION MECHANISM THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE FOR THIS -- NOT UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT WHICH SO FAR DOES NOT RESULT IN REVOCATION EVEN IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES LIKE THE ONE DR PHILIP TO AND SEVEN TWENTY NINE YOU SAY DOES NOT A WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT AS WELL SEVEN TWENTY NINE IS IT SUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT USES SEXUAL CONTACT. AND THAT CONTACT UP AND INTO MEANT. IT'S SEXUAL INTERCOURSE OR CONTACT SODOMY ORAL COPULATION SEXUAL CONTACT WITH THE PATIENT OR CLIENT. THAT IS YOU UP WITH TOUCHING OF AN INTIMATE PART IN THE PENAL CODE AND OF COURSE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE BREAST OF A MAN OR TOUCHING OF ANY OTHER PARTS OTHER THAN THE **** GROWING AND THE BOX. SO THEY'RE VERY NARROW FOR THAT PURPOSES. INTERMENT PART FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEXUAL AROUSAL GRATIFICATION OR ABUSE. IF I COULD RESPOND JUST BRIEFLY -- WE HAVE SITUATIONS NOW WHERE PEOPLE ARE USING THINGS LIKE DIGITAL MEDIA WHERE THEY HAVE NO PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH A CONTACT. WITH THEIR COMPLETELY PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE COMPLETELY SEXUAL ISING. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CLIENT -- THEY COULD ENGAGE IN PHONE SEX WITH THE CLIENT AND STILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT THE MEASURE THAT WE BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND CURRENTLY KISSING IS NOT INCLUDED IN TOUCHING OF AN INTIMATE PART SO THEY CAN CONTINUE. TO KISS AND MAKE OUT ESSENTIALLY -- AND THAT DOES NOT COUNT AS WELL. SO THEN I GUESS MY THEN I GUESS THEY QUIT IF IF THIS IS A WIDESPREAD. ISSUE. WHICH I I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS BUT IF IT IF IT IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE THEN WHY IS IT JUST PSYCHOLOGISM WHY ARE WE DOING AND ALL THE HELPING PROFESSIONS ALSO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD. YEAH RESPOND TO THAT IS FIRST OF ALL -- THE BOARD'S PSYCHOLOGY CAME TO ME WITH THIS -- I THINK THAT IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE DESIRE TO AND FELT THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR OTHER BOARD STYLE BE CERTAINLY THAN HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY PROPOSAL FOR AMENDMENTS. TO ADDRESS THAT -- YEAH BUT I SO I I THINK THE BOARDS ECOLOGY CAME TO ME WITH THIS PROPOSAL BUT IF THE REASON IF YOU'RE IF THINK ISSUE IS IT'S TOO NARROW. I CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE THE COMMITTEE TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE OTHER BOARDS OUT I'VE BEEN AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE STAFF TO GO AND ASK EACH BOARD DO YOU NEED THIS -- SO YOU KNOW WE WERE NOT PROPOSED ANY AMENDMENTS -- TO TO TO TRY TO DRESS THOSE CONCERNS OF THAT WAS A SIGNET THAT'S THE MAIN CONCERN OF THE COMMITTEE -- WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO TO TO ENTERTAIN AND AND AND EXAMINE THAT -- BUT THAT'S NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELL SO -- IT IT IS A POOR TO PSYCHOLOGY BILL AND THAT'S SO WHY IT IS THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW BUT CERTAINLY WOULD BEEN OPEN -- TO SEE IF PROPOSALS FOR AMENDMENTS TO SAY WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S OTHER YOU WRITE THIS OTHER THERAPISTS AND EIGHT OF THE CODE DOESN'T ADDRESS THOSE AS WELL AND HAVE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER BOARDS. RACE BECAUSE HE NOW SAYS CLINICALLY SAY SAID THE THE THINGS YOU'RE DESCRIBING HER ALREADY COVERED UNDER THE CODE RIGHT SO THAT'S MEAN. SO I GUESS THAT'S MY ISSUE IF IF YOU KNOW OFFICES ALL CLEARLY COVERED UNDER THE CODE. THEN WHY WOULD WE JUST DO ONE SMALL JUST THAT THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU. AN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. SEE NONE SENATOR PENN DO YOU WISH TO CLOSE. YES -- SO I WOULD I WOULD MAE NOTE THAT AGAIN -- THE BEHAVIORS ARE. COVER BUT THE PENALTY -- IS UNFORTUNATELY -- YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO REMOVE THE LICENSE AND SO DO YOU THINK ABOUT A THERAPIST WHO ENGAGES IN THIS KIND BEHAVIOR WE CAN PUT THEM ON PROBATION. BUT THE BOARD AND WHO IS HERE WHO IS TRIED. AS AS BEEN UNABLE TO BE ABLE -- TO ACTUAL REVOKE THE LICENSES OF PEOPLE THIS BEHAVIOR NOW HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE'VE UNFORTUNATELY I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES -- AMONGST WHETHER IT'S OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE STAFF OTHER PEOPLE WE SAID THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THERE SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT. THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY SAYS. HIS JOB IT IS TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAYS THERE SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT CONSERVE AND THERE'S CONSEQUENCES IF IT. BASICALLY IS AN ABUSE OF THAT. THE PATIENT CLIENT RELATIONSHIP -- THE THE THERAPIST CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. TO THE AGREE DISAGREE THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WE SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION OF REVOKING THE LICENSE BECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. THEY WILL STILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE CONTACT FUTURE PATIENTS ARE I'M GOING PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE ON PROBATION AT THAT THE MEDIA TAKING CLASSES ANY UNDER SUPERVISION BUT AN INVENTION PROVISIONAL AND AND SO IT'S THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY WHO'S HERE SAYING WE NEED THIS. RIGHT IT'S NOT DOCTOR PAN GOING -- I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE IS THE BOARD'S PSYCHOLOGY SAYS WE'VE TRIED WE'VE TRIED AND WE CAN'T MAKE -- PROGRESS. AND I THINK SO CERTAINLY FOR ALL OF US WHO WORKED SO HARD TO BE SURE WE CREATE A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT HERE. WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE EVEN MORE VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE SEEKING SAIKIA ELSE A PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP. ARE PROTECTED. I WOULD YOU KNOW IT AGAIN I'VE CERTAINLY BEEN OPEN TO IF THERE ARE ANY AMENDMENTS OR SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE -- PROPOSED. YOU KNOW NONE OF OUR BILLS ARE PERFECT WE ALWAYS SEEK TO PERFECT OUR BILLS THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS CERTAINLY I WOULD WELCOME THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT SO FAR HAVE NOT BEEN PROPOSED -- ANY AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WHETHER IT'S NOT BROAD ENOUGH FOR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS -- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS BILL HAS. GONE THROUGH THE SENATE I KNOW YOU'RE DIFFERENT HOUSE -- BUT THERE'S HAD BEEN NO NO VOTES THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- AND AND SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR PATIENTS THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE BOARD IS ASKING OUR HELP. I HOPE YOU WILL STEP UP AND HELP THEM TO GIVE THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED. TO GO AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY SHOULD NOT BE CONTINUING TO PRACTICE PSYCHOLOGY. AND DISCOVERED THAT ARE STRICTLY ASK FOR AN I. BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SENATOR PAN -- FOR THE YOUR COMMITMENT IT IN THIS AREA WE OF COURSE IN ASSEMBLY BEING P. WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY TYPE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT -- AND SHARE THE TYPE OF CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE ALSO ARTICULATED A SIMILAR RELATED IS -- OUR DUTY AS A COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOKS ARE CURRENTLY AND WHETHER OR NOT FOR EXAMPLE IS IT REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THAT THE CURRENTLY ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. ENTER AND WE'VE BEEN SEEING GRANTING PROBATION -- AND SUSPENDING LICENSES -- CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE ASSEMBLY WE'VE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER BOARDS AND ENTITIES UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WILL SHARE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SEE IF THIS IS A PERVASIVE ISSUE. A BUT UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS TIME IS TOO NARROW IN SCOPE WHICH IS WHY WE DO NOT OFFER ANY IMMENSE AT THIS TIME SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT AND WILL JOIN YOU. IN THESE COLLECTIVE EFFORTS AS WE EXPLORE EDITION OPPORTUNITIES MOVING INTO THE FUTURE -- SO HAVING SAID THAT -- IS THERE MOTION. CENTER AND WE WILL -- KEEP THIS SET HERE IN IS THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESERVATION THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PANICKING WELL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL ITEM WHICH IS.
