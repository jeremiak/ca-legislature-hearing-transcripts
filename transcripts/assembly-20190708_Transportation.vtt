00:33:05.016 --> 00:33:05.550
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONE OF THE

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:06.250
KEY SELLING POINTS FOR US WAS TO

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:06.918
SAY THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.353
STATE MATCHING FUNDS OF WE GOT

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.020
OUR OWN MEASURE.

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:10.054
ON SB ONE WAS A REAL GREAT GAME

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.256
CHANGER IN THAT REGARD AND WE

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.225
THINK OF COURSE SENATOR BELL --

00:33:14.292 --> 00:33:15.193
CARE FRAZIER AND THE WHOLE

00:33:15.259 --> 00:33:16.361
LEGISLATURE FOR THEIR SUPPORT

00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.528
THAT MEASURE.

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.930
ON THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:21.132
IS ONE PROGRAM THAT GUARANTEES

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:22.233
THAT WE WILL GET THESE MATCHING

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.768

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:27.305
FIFTY THOUSAND UNDER THE CURRENT

00:33:27.372 --> 00:33:28.806
FORMULA PER YEAR -- BUT IN THE

00:33:28.873 --> 00:33:29.941
COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WE GOT A

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:31.175
GRANT FROM NINETEEN MILLION

00:33:31.242 --> 00:33:32.610

REGIONAL BY WAY.

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:35.813
AND IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US OVER

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.782
TWENTY YEARS TO GET THAT MONEY

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:40.451
SO -- IF IF THE PROGRAM WERE A

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.587
100% COMPETITIVE SO AS A RESULT

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:43.621
WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:46.090
SOME KIND OF POT FOR OF

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.692
COMPETITION ESPECIALLY FOR THE

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.360
SMALL COUNTIES -- WE DO FEEL

00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:50.995

OF 50% FOR NO OFFENSE AND 50%

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:09.180
COMPETITIVE SO THAT WE WOULD

00:34:09.247 --> 00:34:10.114
HAVE ENOUGH OF A COMPETITIVE

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:12.717
FORMULA -- BUT WE HAD A REALLY

00:34:12.784 --> 00:34:14.285
EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION AMONG ALL

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:26.330
COUNTIES.

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.532
BUT IT ALSO GIVES US A CHANCE TO

00:34:27.598 --> 00:34:28.900
DO REALLY MEANINGFUL PROJECT

00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:30.601

LANGUAGE IS CURRENTLY WORDED.

00:34:56.694 --> 00:34:58.863
AND WE HOPE THAT AS IS MEASURE

00:34:58.930 --> 00:34:59.530
MOVES ALONG THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:34:59.597 --> 00:35:00.531

SEVERAL OF OF THOSE PROJECTS

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.284

FULLY FUNDED.

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:09.887

SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:19.597

THAT TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR POT

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:32.977
IS ELIMINATED AND I BELIEVE SO

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.046
IS THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:38:35.112 --> 00:38:36.881
DOLLAR GUARANTEE FOR SMALLER --

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:45.756

SEVERAL OF THESE COUNTIES.

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:51.696
THEY DON'T GENERATE VERY MUCH

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:52.296
PER YEAR AND SO WE REALLY DO

WHEN YOU MOVED TO STRICTLY

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.046
FORMULAIC COLLOCATION IT COULD

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:58.282

ABOUT 11% OF THE POPULATION OF

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.931
SELF HELP COUNTIES AND THEY'VE

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.633

FUNDING SO.

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.702
THE THE ORGANIZATION I I WILL

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:28.178
ORGANIZATION DELIBERATED AND

00:42:28.245 --> 00:42:30.047
TRIED TO WORK AND COME UP WITH

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:30.814
FORMULAS THAT.

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:32.483
NOT ONLY TOOK CARE OF THOSE THAT

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.718

INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:57.474
THE SPLIT BETWEEN -- LARGE

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.243
COUNTIES AND SMALL COUNTIES

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.644
SMALL COUNTIES HAVE A SEPARATE

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:04.448
OUGHT. 15%.

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.917
THE REMAINDER GOES TO THE OVER.

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:10.988

INCLUDED IN THE GROWING EXTRA

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:19.396
15% SO IT'S KIND OF THE

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:19.997
COMPROMISE OF HE WANTS IT THAT

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.131
WAY [inaudible]

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:22.366
COMPROMISES.

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:22.933
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.269
COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:25.569
[inaudible]

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:28.372
MR BIGELOW.

I I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS --

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.309
MISSED ABOUT.

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.777
THIS IS REALLY A WE BOTH WORKED

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:35.512
ON THIS IS COUNTY SUPERVISORS IN

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:36.347
THE PAST.

00:43:36.413 --> 00:43:37.681
IT IS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.383
THOUGH FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:42.653
MAKING UP 11% OF THE POPULATION

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.620
IT REALLY.

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:45.856
ISN'T THE REAL THRUSTING ISSUE

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.024
THE THRUSTING ISSUES AMOUNT OF

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:49.126
MILES THE SERVER AND WITH THE

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.828
PREVIOUS FORMULA THE PREVIOUS

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:52.196
FORMING A KIND OF GAVE A LITTLE

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:53.931
ADDED VALUE TO THOSE SMALLER

00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:55.933
COMMUNITIES. TO MANAGE

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.068
THEMSELVES IN A BETTER WAY --

00:43:58.135 --> 00:44:00.304
MAYBE YOU COULD ADDRESS HOW HOW

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.305
YOU HOW YOU.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.740
YOU SAW COMING TO THIS SOLUTION

00:44:02.806 --> 00:44:04.308
SO I CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.442
BECAUSE I HAVE A ONE OF THE

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:06.643
COUNTIES THAT'S GOT IN

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:07.611
OPPOSITION.

00:44:07.678 --> 00:44:09.613
I'M TORN BETWEEN THIS WHOLE

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:12.449
SCENARIO I KIND OF LIKE YOUR

00:44:12.516 --> 00:44:14.518
IDEA AND I I'M TORN WITH THE THE

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.553
FOLKS WHO ARE OPPOSING IT SO.

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.688
HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.823
MILEAGE IS LIKE A TWO HUNDRED

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.424
FIFTY THOUSAND TWO OR MILLION

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:22.893
DOLLAR A YEAR ACCOUNT OUT OF THE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:23.894
I WOULD SAY.

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:27.965
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FIVE POINT.

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.735
TWO BILLION FROM SB. ONE OKAY SO --

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:34.271
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT WAY --

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:36.140
VARIOUS PARTS OF THE FORMULA FOR

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:38.976
SP -- ONE BENEFIT ONE GROUP FOR

00:44:39.043 --> 00:44:40.110
THE OTHER GROUP THIS THIS

00:44:40.177 --> 00:44:43.180
FORMULA SLIGHTLY BENEFITS OF

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:46.683
SMALLER COUNTIES BECAUSE OF THE

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:51.355
INFILL EMPHASIS ON THE FACT THAT --

00:44:51.422 --> 00:44:52.990
WE'RE WE'RE BASING IT ON THE

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.658
WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDS TO

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:57.428
BASE IT ON THE THE FACT THAT

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.797
THEY PASSED THE OF SALES TAX SO

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.398
WE BASE SOME OF IT ON REVENUE

00:45:01.465 --> 00:45:03.133
AND ON POPULATION.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.337
SO -- IT'S FOR THIS ONE SUB

00:45:07.404 --> 00:45:09.339
ACCOUNT IT'S BASED ON THAT KIND

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:11.341
OF FORMULA AS A COMPROMISE OTHER

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.744
OTHER FORMULAS.

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:14.678
BENEFIT.

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:17.014
COUNTIES THAT ARE LARGELY MILES

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:18.816
LIKE THE GAS TAX FORMULA COURSE

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.117
DOES.

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:23.420
AND LIKE URBAN COUNTIES GET LESS.

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:26.657
BASED ON POPULATION PER CAPITA.

00:45:26.723 --> 00:45:28.625
THEN SOME SMALL COUNTIES WITH

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:32.196
LARGE LANE MILES SO IT'S KIND OF

00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:34.198
I WOULD LOOK AT IT LIKE THAT IS

00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:37.367
PART OF THE IT'S ONE SUBGROUP.

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:39.570
SO WE TRY TO TREAT THEM FAIRLY

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:40.571
AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:41.772
COMPROMISE I THINK THEY WORKED

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:44.007
OUT AND WE WE HAVE A SIZE THEY

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.709
WORKED IT OUT THEY WORKED IT OUT

00:45:45.776 --> 00:45:48.145
THEY WERE THE ONES THAT CAME UP

00:45:48.212 --> 00:45:49.346
WITH THE SCARBOROUGH.

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.481
SO THE FINAL QUESTION IS YEAH

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.316
YOU DON'T SEE AN ISSUE WITH THE

00:45:52.382 --> 00:45:53.817
THE ISSUE OF COMPOUNDING THE THE

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:55.352
REVENUES FOR THE LOCAL SO WHEN

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:56.520
THEY HAVE YOU HAVE A MAJOR

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:57.688
SUBDIVISION.

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.189
THAT'S CREATED AND THEY DO HAVE

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.358
AS AN EXAMPLE THE NINETEEN

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:01.959
THOUSAND THAT WAS UTILIZED.

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:04.394
YOU AT THAT NUMBER WITH THE THE

00:46:04.461 --> 00:46:07.297
LOCAL MATCH FROM THE LOCAL

00:46:07.364 --> 00:46:08.565
COMMUNITY.

00:46:08.632 --> 00:46:09.199
YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE A LARGER

00:46:09.266 --> 00:46:11.068
CHUNK OF THAT.

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.369
I THINK HERE YOU KNOW ON THE

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.972
ACCOUNT MAYBE NOT AND DRAW DOWN

00:46:15.038 --> 00:46:16.773
ON IT MORE THAN.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.876
THEN THE OTHERS COULD EVER GET.

00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:21.745
TO I THINK MOST OF THE FORMULAS

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.213
BASED ON POPULATION AND PART OF

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.015
PART OF ITS BASED ON THE REVENUE

00:46:25.082 --> 00:46:26.617
FROM THE SALES TAX OR DEVELOPER

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:27.651
FEES SO.

00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:29.052
IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT'S SKEWED

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:32.890
TOWARDS POPULATION.

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:35.325
AMONG THE SMALL COUNTY GROUP.

00:46:35.392 --> 00:46:36.560
OKAY SO YOU KIND OF YOU KIND OF

00:46:36.627 --> 00:46:39.596
GOT A LOOK AT THE THE FORMULA

00:46:39.663 --> 00:46:41.698
THE WEIGHTS WORK IT WAS A

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:44.935
COMPROMISE EVERYBODY AGREED.

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:47.604
TO RATHER MOST PEOPLE AGREE.

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:48.805
TO YEAH I WAS JUST LOOKING OTHER

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:51.108
MEMBER.

00:46:51.175 --> 00:46:53.443
IF I MY CAR FOR THE THE ISSUE --

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.745
IT'S THE NOTION THAT -- LET'S

00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:58.215
SAY -- ONE LARGER COUNTIES

00:46:58.282 --> 00:46:59.583
SERVICES GO LESS ANGELES THAT

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.851
PARTY HAS A SALES TAX BUT THEY

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.085
HAVE A DEVELOPER FEES WELL THE

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:03.086
WAY THE LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IS

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.454
CURRENTLY WRITTEN IS THAT THEY'D

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:05.489
STILL BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THIS

00:47:05.556 --> 00:47:06.757
QUOTE SMALL COUNTIES COMPETITIVE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:07.791
POT.

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:09.693
THAT'S THAT'S THE ISSUE IT AT

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.295
HAND AS FAR AS I SEE IT I DON'T

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.396
KNOW THAT THAT WAS.

00:47:12.462 --> 00:47:15.899
INTENDED OR NOT IT'S JUST THE

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:17.868
WAY THAT.

00:47:17.935 --> 00:47:19.136
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN SO THAT THAT'S

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:20.370
THE ONLY ISSUE THERE WOULD STILL

00:47:20.437 --> 00:47:21.004
BE ABLE TO USE THAT MONEY DOES

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:24.274
THAT MATCH. FOR THEIR THEIR

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:28.045
FORMULA FUNDS -- TAKE THE SMALL

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.313
COUNTY PART CAN BE USED BY LOS

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.914
ANGELES IT'S A IT'S GOT TOO MANY

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:35.118
PEOPLE.

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.653
THAT WAY SO I I THINK I THINK WE

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:37.888
DIVIDE WEEKLY THE CURRENT

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.990
VERSION OF THE BILL.

00:47:40.057 --> 00:47:41.158
PUTS A SUB ACCOUNT. FOR SMALL

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:41.458
[inaudible]

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:42.793
COUNTIES.

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:47.664
SO IT'S A SEGREGATED SUB ACCOUNT.

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.233
IT IS.

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:51.001

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:51.235

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.968

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.478
BUT WAS SB ONE AND I THINK

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:25.581

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.052
SOFT NUMBER.

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:32.188
AT SOME POINT IN TIME.

01:06:32.254 --> 01:06:34.056
WHAT THIS WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.092
THE MAINTENANCE?

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:37.760
OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAYS

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.862
TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE ONLY HAVE

01:06:39.929 --> 01:06:40.496
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND

01:06:40.563 --> 01:06:41.464

OF THOSE TYPES OF IMPROVEMENTS.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:19.902
ON THE OTHER HAND WE NEED TO

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:23.406

23% OR 4%.

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:40.656
OF THE FLOW AND IT'S A LITTLE

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.692
CONCERNING OF CALTRANS DOESN'T.

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.360
KNOW THAT.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:48.931
YET -- WE'RE NOTMEAN IT IS IT'S

01:07:48.998 --> 01:07:50.699
HARD TO MAKE POLICY ON THAT

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.967
BASIS BUT IT.

01:07:52.034 --> 01:07:53.269
AS AS THE CHAIR SAID AS OR EVEN

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:55.805
A SOFT NUMBER AVAILABLE TODAY

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.973
HOW HOW WILL HOW WILL HOW WILL

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:02.144

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.446
THIS BILL [inaudible]

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.381
STATE WHAT.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.248
SO -- COMPLETE TO SALOMON'S ARE

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:08.050
INCLUDED IN THE PROJECTS IN THE

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:10.319
SHOP -- AND SO IT BECOMES VERY

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.254
DIFFICULT TO TRY TO PARSE OUT

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.823
HOW MUCH IS SPENT ON EACH

01:08:13.889 --> 01:08:15.858
DIFFERENT PIECE OF THAT PROJECT

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:16.659
BECAUSE THERE'S VARIOUS

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.561
ENVIRONMENTAL SUPPORT DESIGN

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:21.030
COSTS -- THAT SERVE MULTIPLE

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:22.164
PURPOSES OF THE PROJECTS BECOMES

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.599
VERY DIFFICULT TO TRY TO

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.135
QUANTIFY THE ACTUAL COST ELEMENT

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.804
OF ANY PIECE OF A PROJECT AS A

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.940
RESULT OF THAT.

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:31.841
ALSO AT THIS TIME -- YOU KNOW WE

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:32.842
COULD TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN GET

01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:34.410
SOMETHING TO YOU LATER AT A

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:36.145
LATER DATE -- TO AT A COST

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.346
ESTIMATE BUT AT THIS POINT IT

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:40.349
BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO DO

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:43.352
THAT SUFFICE YESTERDAY IT WILL

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.186
LIKELY GO UP.

01:08:44.253 --> 01:08:44.787
WHATEVER THE CURRENT STATE OF

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:45.588
AFFAIRS IS IT WILL LIKELY

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:47.122
INCREASE.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.058
IF THIS BILL BECOMES LAW.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:49.992
BECAUSE IT'LL BE FOUR IT'LL BE

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:51.760
FORMALIZED AND IT'LL BE

01:08:51.827 --> 01:08:54.864
BROADCAST. TO IN AN AND I'M NOT

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.098
SAYING THAT'S A BAD THING IT'S

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:57.867
JUST WILL BE IT IT'S GOOD TO

01:08:57.933 --> 01:09:00.903
KNOW THAT.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.373
I I THINK -- AND I REALLY

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.176
RESPECT THE QUESTION I I AND I I

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:08.344

MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO

01:09:09.144 --> 01:09:09.378
UNDERSTAND.

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.679
THAT WE'RE NOT INTRODUCING A NEW

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:14.550
CONCEPT CURRENTLY SHOP PROGRAMS

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.118
FOR FOR MAINTENANCE -- DO

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.453

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.055
AND CAL TRANS HAS POLICY CENTER

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.857
THIS SHOULD HAPPEN -- THE

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:23.659
CHALLENGES THAT IT'S NOT

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:25.728
STRUCTURE AND SO SOMETIMES IT

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:26.395
HAPPENS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T --

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:28.030
THIS BILL ALSO PROVIDES

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.832
FLEXIBILITY YOU HAVE TO BRING A

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:32.601

WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PUT A

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:39.708
STRAIGHT JACKET ON THE AGENCY%

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.343
BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE.

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.313
BEEN IN PLACE FOR A WHILE --

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:45.748
ACTUALLY MEANS SOMETHING AND

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:50.219
HAVING A STOCKS IN THE BOOKS --

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.954
WILL WILL DO THAT.

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:54.256
GOOD IS IT FAIR TO SAY I MEAN I

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:55.824
USE THE WORD -- YOUR FORMALIZING

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:56.492

SO -- FOR DINNER WITH THE MULLIN

01:28:47.955 --> 01:28:49.090
DEALS AND MY NIECE AND NEPHEW WE

HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT THIS BILL

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:50.692
BECAUSE WE TRY TO BRING

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.093
SOMETHING TO THE TABLE PERIODIC

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.262
THEY TALK ABOUT BILLS IN THE

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.029
PROCESS.

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:57.298
AND SO I'M GOING TO SHARE A

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:59.834
COUPLE OF THEIR CONCERNS -- AND

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.536
GRANTED THEY HAVE READ THE BILL

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:02.937
BUT I'M GONNA TELL YOU THE ONES

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:03.137
THAT.

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:04.439
THE CONCERNED ABOUT.

01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:05.973
SECONDHAND SMOKE.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:11.345
IN A CONFINED AREA -- INDIVIDUAL

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:12.814
CONTROL OF CONSUMPTION.

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:14.582
THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.584
IF IF YOU'VE HAD TOO MUCH SMOKE

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:20.288
IN A THE CAR OR WHATEVER.

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:21.923
OTHER INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:25.059
APPRECIATE THAT SMOKE.

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:26.961
FOR GETTING INTO A BAR I MEANT

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.263
RENTING ONE OF THESE -- VEHICLES

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:31.866
AND THE RESIDUAL SMOKE IS STILL

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:34.202
IN IT AS WE KNOWS AND THERE'S NO

01:29:34.268 --> 01:29:35.870
SMOKING ROOMS BUT YOU STILL KNOW

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.572
IT'S BEEN SMOKED IN RIGHT.

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:38.506
SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:40.475
QUESTIONS THEY COME UP WITH JUST

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.042
IF YOU.

01:29:41.109 --> 01:29:45.379
DON'T THINK YOU -- AND THE ISSUE.

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.647
RELATED TO THIS BILL IS.

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:47.715
YOU WOULDN'T BE ON THIS BUS

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:50.084
UNLESS YOU WERE INTENDING TO

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:53.955
PARTAKE OF OF CANNABIS OR GOING

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:56.657
TO ARE GOING TO A CANNABIS

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.326
FACILITY WHERE YOU WOULD PARTAKE

01:29:58.392 --> 01:30:00.795
THERE THEN GET ON THE BUS.

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:03.331
THE IDEA IS THAT -- THIS IS LIKE

01:30:03.397 --> 01:30:06.033
A UP OF A LIQUOR TOUR WINE TOUR

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.702
APPEAR TO OR WHERE THEY WOULD BE

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:09.137
DOING THAT THE CONCERN THAT WE

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:11.172
HAVE IS TO IN THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.073
BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:12.807
ELSE.

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:15.076
IS AFFECTED BY THAT THROUGH

01:30:15.143 --> 01:30:17.545
EXTERIOR GOING OUT A WINDOW THAT

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:18.713
THE SMOKING AFFECTION ONE

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.748
OUTSIDE OR GET INTO THAT THE

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.350
DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE SO THE THE

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:23.518
IDEA IS THAT THOSE THAT ARE

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.820
SMOKING AND PARTICIPATING IN

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.121
THIS AND PARTAKING OF THAT.

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.356
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THEY

01:30:28.422 --> 01:30:29.757
WOULD FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THAT

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.125
THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:30:31.192 --> 01:30:33.094
THEY'RE PROTECTED -- WHEN THEY

01:30:33.161 --> 01:30:34.262
GET OUT OF THERE IN SOME WAY

01:30:34.328 --> 01:30:35.463
THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING INTO A

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:36.998
VEHICLE SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:37.598
TRY?

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.367
TO LOOK AT THAT SOMEHOW TO BUT

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.803
THE PARTY BUS BUS BILLS THAT

01:30:41.869 --> 01:30:42.470
I'VE HAD PREVIOUSLY TO THIS HAVE

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:43.738
LOOKED AT MAKING SURE THAT

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:44.872
THEY'RE NOT GETTING ONTO A

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:46.474
VEHICLE BUT THIS IS.

01:30:46.541 --> 01:30:50.878
MAINLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE --

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:51.746
DESIGNATED.

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:54.348
TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT BEHAVIOR

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:56.417
AND ACTIVITY -- IN THE ANOTHER

01:30:56.484 --> 01:30:58.386
ONE WAS -- THE WINDOWS ROLLED UP.

01:30:58.452 --> 01:31:00.054
AND GET TAUGHT ME ROLL DOWN THE

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:01.355
WINDOWS AND THE SMOKE'S COMING

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:02.223
OUT OF IT IS IF THAT'S NOT

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:03.291
ALLOWED IN THIS BILL THEY

01:31:03.357 --> 01:31:04.158
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED THROUGH THAT

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:06.060
SMOKE TO LEAVE THAT VEHICLE

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.396
THAT'S WHY IN THE DRIVER'S AREA.

01:31:08.462 --> 01:31:09.030
THE SMALL CAN'T.

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:10.631
IN FUEL IMPACT THE DRIVER THE

01:31:10.698 --> 01:31:11.866
DRIVER IS AT ALL.

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:13.267
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN ENGINEER

01:31:13.334 --> 01:31:15.403
GOING INTO DESIGN MAKING SURE

01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:17.371
THAT THAT IS CLOSED IN AIR TIGHT

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:18.573
TO THAT THERE'S NOT -- THE SEAL

01:31:18.639 --> 01:31:20.775
CAN'T BE BROKEN AND THEY'RE NOT

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:22.276
ALLOWED TO HAVE SMOKE.

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:26.414
EXITING THE THE VEHICLE AS WELL

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.017
COULD THAT BE A SAFETY ISSUE.

01:31:30.084 --> 01:31:30.585
WITH THE WINDOWS ARE CAN BE

01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:33.321
ROLLED DOWN.

01:31:33.387 --> 01:31:34.021
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT ANY

01:31:34.088 --> 01:31:34.822
BASIS FOR THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:35.489
BREAK THE WINDOW YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:31:35.556 --> 01:31:36.858
THAT'S ALSO PART OF PARTY BUSES

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:37.992
AND LIMO ZINES NOW THE VENT

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:38.826
WINDOWS DON'T GO UP AND DOWN.

01:31:38.893 --> 01:31:40.228
THERE HAS TO BE A AN ABILITY TO

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:42.129
TO BREAK THAT WINDOW IN ORDER TO

01:31:42.196 --> 01:31:43.331
ACCESS IT THE TICKET.

01:31:43.397 --> 01:31:45.833
