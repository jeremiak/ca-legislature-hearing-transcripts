00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.361
KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT THIS

00:23:16.428 --> 00:23:17.529

HOW TO IMPLEMENT CCPA.

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.272
THE CHAMBERS WORKED DILIGENTLY

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.607
TO DISTILL THE NUMEROUS CONCERNS

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.542
OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY INTO A

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:31.276
SHORTLIST OF CRITICAL ISSUES

00:23:31.343 --> 00:23:31.910
THAT WOULD END.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:33.979

00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:54.966
THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:55.967
UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE TWO

00:23:56.034 --> 00:23:57.469

CONCERNS AND PROPOSING A

00:24:14.286 --> 00:24:15.620
COMPROMISE ALTERNATIVE TO THE

00:24:15.687 --> 00:24:17.189
ORIGINAL BILL ALTHOUGH IT

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:17.756
DOESN'T ADDRESS ALL OF OUR

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:19.391
CONCERNS IT'S THE FIXES IT DOES

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:20.859
OFFER ARE CRUCIAL TO BUSINESSES

BOIL DOWN TO JUST TWO FIXES

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:31.436
ADDING THE WORD REASONABLY AND

00:24:31.503 --> 00:24:32.270
FRONT OF CAPABLE OF BEING

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:33.839
ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEFINITION

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:35.373

DE IDENTIFIED DATA WHICH MY

00:24:38.276 --> 00:24:38.910
COLLEAGUE JIM HELPER WILL

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:39.811
EXPLAIN.

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:41.313
THE CZ PA DEFINES PERSONAL

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:42.981
INFORMATION VERY BROADLY AS

00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.382
INFORMATION THAT IDENTIFIES

RELATES TO DESCRIBES OR IS

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:48.320
CAPABLE OF BEING ASSOCIATED WITH

WORK COULD REASNABLY BE LINKED

00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:51.489
TO A PARTICULAR CONSUMER

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:52.858
HOUSEHOLD.

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:53.959
ODDLY THE DEFINITION CREATES A

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:55.026
REASONABLENESS STANDARD FOR DATA

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:56.394
THAT CAN BE LINKED TO A PERSON

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:58.196
BUT NOT DATA THAT IS CAPABLE OF

00:24:58.263 --> 00:25:01.099
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH A PERSON

00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:01.833
WHICH IS MORE BROAD.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.134
THAT MEANS THAT PERSONAL

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:04.069
INFORMATION TO THE C. CPA'S

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:05.637

00:25:05.704 --> 00:25:07.339
IN THEORY BE ASSOCIATED WITH

00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:08.773
SOMEONE AND THAT COULD PRODUCE

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.375
SOME EXTREME RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE

00:25:10.442 --> 00:25:11.776
IF A CUSTOMER MAKES PURCHASES AT

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:13.178
A BRICK AND MORTAR STORE.

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:14.479
THAT STORE COULD BE REQUIRED TO

00:25:14.546 --> 00:25:16.014
SEARCH SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:16.948
FROM THE DATES OF THOSE

00:25:17.015 --> 00:25:18.650
PURCHASES TO FIND WHERE THE

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.151
CUSTOMER APPEARS ON IT.

00:25:20.218 --> 00:25:21.386
AND PROVIDE THAT FOOTAGE BACK TO

00:25:21.453 --> 00:25:22.320
THE CUSTOMER OR DELETED EVEN IF

00:25:22.387 --> 00:25:23.121
THE STORE NEVER LINK THAT

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:25.257
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE BACK TO

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:25.757
ANYONE.

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.158
A STORE MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF

00:25:27.225 --> 00:25:28.460
ASSOCIATING THAT DATA WITH A

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:29.961
CUSTOMER AND THEREFORE ARGUABLY

00:25:30.028 --> 00:25:31.630
MUST DO SO UNDER THE LAW.

00:25:31.696 --> 00:25:32.697
IT'S AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:33.798
BUSINESS AND IT DOESN'T ADVANCE

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.967
PRIVACY BUT EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY

00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:36.801
THREE BUT ALLEVIATE MUCH OF THIS

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:37.769
CONCERN BY ADDING THIS

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:39.137
REASONABLE THE STANDARD BEFORE

CAPABLE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH --

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:42.807
FINALLY WE DO AGREE TO REMOVE

00:25:42.874 --> 00:25:44.209
FROM THE BILL THE DEBATE OVER

00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:45.243
HOW TO ADDRESS THE PRIVACY

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.345
IMPLICATIONS OF ALLOWING ONE

COMPLY WITH C. CPA AND I CAN

00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:32.324
TELL YOU THAT A MAJOR CHALLENGE

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:34.059
OF THE LAW IS THAT IT IS SO

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.827
DIFFICULT. FOR BOTH CONSUMERS

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:38.730
AND BUSINESSES TO UNDERSTAND.

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:40.732
THE DEFINITIONS THEY ARE IN SOME

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.300
CASES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE NEW

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:45.003
HEARD SERWIS DESCRIPTION OF THE

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.838
CHALLENGE OF OF PERSONAL

00:26:46.905 --> 00:26:48.807
INFORMATION THE DE IDENTIFIED

00:26:48.873 --> 00:26:50.375
DEFINITION CURRENTLY SAYS

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.344
BASICALLY THE DE IDENTIFIED DATA.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.945
IS INFORMATION THAT IS NOT

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:56.348
PERSONAL DATA THAT CIRCULAR AND

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:57.916
IT DOESN'T PROVIDE GUIDANCE

00:26:57.983 --> 00:27:04.489
ABOUT WHAT TO DO IN ORDER TO DE

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:04.823
IDENTIFY DATA.

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:06.291
DO IDENTIFYING DATA IS A PRO

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:06.825
PRIVACY GOOD PRACTICE AND

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:07.692
THERE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.793
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS THE CPA TO

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:10.795
PROVIDE GUIDANCE ABOUT TO STEER

00:27:10.862 --> 00:27:12.230
BUSINESSES TOWARD DOING THAT

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:13.598
TOWARD THE IDENTIFYING.

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.000
THE AMENDMENT THAT ALISTAIR BIG

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:16.735
THAGARD PROPOSED WOULD FOLLOW

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:19.637
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FTC'S

00:27:19.704 --> 00:27:21.406
PRIVACY FRAMEWORKS APPROACH TO

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:23.241

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.076
IS LINKED OR REASONABLY LINK A

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:27.212
BALL TO A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:29.047
AND THIS IS A WELL TESTED PRO

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.349
PRIVACY APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN

00:27:31.416 --> 00:27:34.219
IN THE LAW FOR FOR NOW ALMOST

00:27:34.285 --> 00:27:36.755
SEVEN YEARS THE CCPA WOULD TREAT

00:27:36.821 --> 00:27:38.790
DATA LINK A BALL TO A HOUSEHOLD

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:40.658
ALSO IS PERSONAL INFORMATION.

00:27:40.725 --> 00:27:41.960
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TEAM NO

00:27:42.027 --> 00:27:43.728
OTHER MAJOR PRIVACY LAW

00:27:43.795 --> 00:27:45.397
INCLUDING IN THE G. P. R. IN

00:27:45.463 --> 00:27:46.464
EUROPE WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.867
LOOKED TO AS A MODEL FOR CCPA.

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:50.635
AND THIS REQUIRES CAREFUL

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:51.870
CONSIDERATION AND MISTER

00:27:51.936 --> 00:27:53.405

WITH YOU ON HOW TO IRON OUT OF

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.642
SOME OF THE STICKY ISSUES HERE

00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:59.344
FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE LISTED AS

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:00.812
LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSEHOLD.

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.080
IN A BUSINESS RACK BUSINESSES

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:04.382
RECORDS MAYBE ROOMMATES WHO

00:28:04.449 --> 00:28:06.418

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:09.120
SPOUSE.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.922
AND FRAUDSTERS COULD ALSO POSE

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.158
AS A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER AND MAKE A

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.793
REQUEST THAT THEY MIGHT DO BUT

00:28:21.699 --> 00:28:22.567
REQUEST.

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:23.868
THAT SEEMS TO COME FROM ONE

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:25.236
MEMBER OF THE HOUSEHOLD COULD

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:27.172
GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

00:28:27.238 --> 00:28:29.040
INCLUDE PRIVACY PROBLEMS FOR

OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND

00:28:30.942 --> 00:28:32.310
MAJOR OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES FOR

BUSINESSES FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.613
ALSO BE CONFLICTING REQUESTS

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.247
FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE THE SAME

THE CCPA THEN NARROWS THE

THEY'RE USED FOR A PURPOSE

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.351
THAT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE

00:39:18.923 --> 00:39:20.458
IT'S CONFUSING AND IT'S IT'S NOT

WORKABLE -- IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:22.993
HOW BUSINESS WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.295
FIGURE OUT WHY THE GOVERNMENT

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:25.396
AND HE MADE THAT INFORMATION

AND EVEN IF THEY COULD FIGURE

00:39:27.832 --> 00:39:29.033
THAT OUT WHY THE GOVERNMENT

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.000
RECORDS WERE RELEASED TO THE

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:32.136

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:32.903
INSTANCES WHERE BUSINESS WOULD

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:33.904
BE DEEMED TO USE THAT

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.108
PUBLIC.

00:39:37.174 --> 00:39:38.375
SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A POPULAR

00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:39.677
REAL ESTATE WEBSITE THAT GIVES

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:41.078

IT TO CREATE A SERVICE FOR

POTENTIAL HOMEBUYERS.

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:46.217

SERVICE AND MAKE A PROFIT. TO

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.224
SEE HOW THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:54.125
FOR WHATEVER REASON THE

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.560

LIMITATION ON THE USE OF

JUST A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT FIX

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:02.066
AND IT'S NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:04.235

FOR PRIVACY REFORM.

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:07.224
I'M THE FIRST THING THAT I WANT

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.526
TO SAY TO YOU IS THAT WE ARE NOT

00:52:09.593 --> 00:52:14.097
OPPOSED TO THE EXEMPTION OF

00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:16.733
LOYALTY PROGRAMS FROM CCPA.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.902
WHICH SORT OF MAKES YOU WONDER

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.537
WHY I'M SITTING HERE -- THE

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.205
FIRST THING TO SAY IS THAT IT IS

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:24.007
IMPORTANT THAT COMPANIES AND

00:52:24.074 --> 00:52:26.142
PROGRAMS DISCLOSE WHAT'S BEING

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:28.378
DONE WITH THE DATA OF CUSTOMERS

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:32.082
IF BY PARTICIPATING IN A LOYALTY

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.316
PROGRAM YOUR DATA IS BEING

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.352
SHARED WITH THIRD PARTIES AND

00:52:35.418 --> 00:52:35.552
SOLD.

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:36.987
YOU SHOULD BE TOLD.

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:39.222
HOWEVER THE REALITY IS THAT

00:52:39.289 --> 00:52:40.423
PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR THESE

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.925
PROGRAMS VOLUNTARILY THEY

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:44.928
CONSENT THEY AFFIRMATIVELY OPTED

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:45.562
BECAUSE THEY GET STUFF THAT THEY

00:52:45.629 --> 00:52:47.163
WANT.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:48.632
BUT THERE'S A BIGGER SORT OF A

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:50.066
PROBLEM HERE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:52:50.133 --> 00:52:53.103
NON DISCRIMINATION LANGUAGE IN

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.271
CCPA ARE BRINGING THIS UP

00:52:54.337 --> 00:52:55.572
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME EARLIER

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:56.806
VERSIONS OF THE BILL THAT TACKLE

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:57.507
THIS.

00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:59.843
AND NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.811
GETTING FURTHER -- A FURTHER

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:04.681
DISTANCE FROM WHERE WE SHOULD BE

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:07.083
WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THAT

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.919
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CIVIL

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:09.986
RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:53:10.053 --> 00:53:11.655
PRIVACY AS PROTECTED IN OUR

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.256
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.491
AND BASICALLY THE WHOLE PREMISE

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.126
OF OF CCPA IS THAT WE AREN'T

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.928
FORCING A BASIC RIGHT THAT

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:18.929
PEOPLE HAVE.

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:20.864
THAT RIGHT REALLY CAN'T CALM

00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:23.800
WITH A FEE IT CAN'T COME WITH A

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:25.435
POLL TAX.

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.337
WE IT CAN'T COME WITH A FEE

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:30.073
REASONABLY RELATED TO THE VALUE

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.043
OF YOUR DATA SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.977
THIS PORTION.

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.746
OF CCPA WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:53:36.813 --> 00:53:38.815
IMPACT OF THE LANGUAGE THAT IS

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.350
THERE.

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.184
AND I THINK WE HAVE AN

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:42.886
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO DO SOMETHING

00:53:42.953 --> 00:53:45.155
BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE DONE

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.022
BECAUSE I WANT TO BE CLEAR THE

00:53:46.089 --> 00:53:48.458
PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY.

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:51.661
OUR PRIVACY VIOLATIONS.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:53.263
AND ABUSES THEY'RE NOT THE

00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:55.332
PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE TALKING TO

00:53:55.398 --> 00:53:57.267
YOU TODAY THEY ARE THE POOR THEY

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.035
ARE THE ELDERLY THEY ARE THE

00:53:59.102 --> 00:54:00.971
PEOPLE THAT DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH.

00:54:01.037 --> 00:54:02.706
THAT TO REALLY SUFFERS AND

00:54:02.772 --> 00:54:04.608
THERE'S NO I MEAN CALIFORNIA'S

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:06.276
HIGHEST COST OF LIVING.

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.877
IN THE COUNTRY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE

00:54:07.944 --> 00:54:09.879
PRIVACY BUDGETS AND JEEZ I WORK

00:54:09.946 --> 00:54:12.248
FOR A NONPROFIT AND I DON'T HAVE

00:54:12.315 --> 00:54:13.583
A PRIVACY BUDGET I MEAN THE

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:14.951
REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO

00:54:15.018 --> 00:54:16.519
OPT OUT SEQUENTIALLY OVER AND

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:17.721
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:20.090
AND PAY A FEE EVERY SINGLE TIME

00:54:20.156 --> 00:54:22.859
THAT WE ARE NOT REALLY GRANTING

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:24.194
THEM A RIGHT.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.862
WE ARE GRANTING THEM A GAUNTLET

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.931
OF FEES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.900
BE ABLE TO JUMP OFF IT SO I WANT

00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:34.170
TO ENCOURAGE THE OFFICE WHEN YOU

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.205
TAKE A LOOK AT THE NON.

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:37.974
DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE AND

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:39.843
SPEAKER MULLIN SAID SOMETHING

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:41.311
ABOUT NOT WANTING.

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:42.579
THINGS TO BE FINANCIALLY

00:54:42.646 --> 00:54:44.547
BURDENSOME I THINK MAYBE THAT

00:54:44.614 --> 00:54:46.883
PART ABOUT FEES REASONABLY

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:48.585
RELATED TO YOUR DATA.

00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:49.986
IT NEEDS SOME CHANGING AND I

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.554
HOPE THAT WE CAN DO THAT.

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.223
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT DEL

00:54:53.289 --> 00:54:54.724
NEXT ONE IS PLEASE HI ELSTER

TECH WERE CALIFORNIA'S FOR

00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:57.460
CONSUMER PRIVACY OF RESPECTFUL

00:54:57.527 --> 00:54:58.328
IN OPPOSITION.

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:00.730
NO I AM NOT INTO COMMERCE I WANT

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.666
COMMERCE TO CONTINUE -- ADDRESS

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.300
THE BILL THAT WAY ORIGINALLY I'M

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:05.468
A MEMBER OF MULTIPLE LOYALTY

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:07.504
PROGRAM TO THINK THEY'RE FINE I

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:09.739
HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THEM -- AND

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.441
IN FACT MOST -- CALIFORNIA

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:15.145
REMEMBER THEM AND AND AND REALLY

00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:16.046
LIKE THEM.

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:16.613
WHAT I WOULD SAY -- THERE'S

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.147
NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT

00:55:17.213 --> 00:55:18.148
PROHIBITS LOYALTY PROGRAMS ZERO

00:55:18.214 --> 00:55:19.049
ZILCH.

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.483
THIS BILL IS FINE WITH WILL BE

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.885
PROGRAMS SO THIS.

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:24.554
THE REASON FOR THIS LAW IS

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:26.823
OBVIOUSLY NOT SIMPLY TO CLARIFY

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:29.492
THE PRIVACY PROGRAM DID THAT --

00:55:29.559 --> 00:55:30.660
LOYALTY PROGRAMS ARE PERMITTED.

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.028
SO NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO POINT

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.363

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.632

PROGRAM TO BE SOLD IN.

00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:49.646

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.880
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:04.547
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY BUYING

00:58:04.614 --> 00:58:08.051
DIAPERS THERE.

00:58:08.117 --> 00:58:10.386

LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM -- AND

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:15.792
AND MY FEAR IS THAT IF WE DON'T

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:17.360
DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND WE DON'T

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:19.028
GO THOUGHT FOR WITH HIS BILL --

00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.263
WE RUN THE RISK OF ACTUALLY

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:21.064
LOSING THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.132
BECAUSE IF I'M A PART OF A

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.767
LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAM.

00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:27.971
AND I SAY NOW UNDER C. C. P. A.

00:58:28.037 --> 00:58:29.105
I. ONE OPT OUT.

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:30.940
NO NOT HAVE MY INFORMATION USED

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:33.610
WELL IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT YOU

00:58:33.676 --> 00:58:34.677

CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.180
BECAUSE I'VE OPTED OUT SO.

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:39.282
I'M I'M NOW OPTING OUT OF YOU

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.283
BEING ABLE TO USE MY PERSONAL

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.517
INFORMATION OR ANY OF MY

00:58:41.584 --> 00:58:43.953
INFORMATION BUT YOU STILL HAVE.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.422
TO GIVE ME THAT DISCOUNT -- AND

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.091
SO THERE'S REALLY BEEN BECOMES

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:50.026
NO INCENTIVE FOR THAT COMPANY TO

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:51.761
CONTINUE TO OFFER THAT LOYALTY

00:58:51.828 --> 00:58:53.162
REWARDS PROGRAM.

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:54.964
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.599
AGAINST ME BECAUSE I'M OPTING

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:57.700
OUT THE PROGRAM SO THEREFORE YOU

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:58.268
STILL HAVE TO GIVE ME THE

00:58:58.334 --> 00:58:59.736
DISCOUNT SO THEN WHAT IS THE

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:01.304
POINT OF ME EVER EVER HAVING TO

00:59:01.371 --> 00:59:03.106
SIGN UP. FOR THE LOYALTY REWARDS

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:04.340

HAVE TO GIVE ME THE DISCOUNT

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:09.479
ANYWAYS -- AND AND SO I THINK

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:10.847
THAT.

00:59:10.914 --> 00:59:11.848
WHEN WE?

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:14.717
YOU KNOW WE HAD TO ACT FAST AND

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:15.218
IT TO TAKE IN A LOT OF

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:16.953
INFORMATION WHEN WE WERE OFF

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.054
WHEN WE WHEN WE HAD TO TAKE A

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:18.855
VOTE.

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:20.323
ON THE C. C. P. A I THINK THAT

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.492
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY WE DID THE

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:23.960
RIGHT THING -- THROUGH THE

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:25.128
CHAIRS WORK IN CENTER HERTZBERG

00:59:25.194 --> 00:59:26.696
WORK IN EVERYBODY ELSE'S -- BUT

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.131
WE NEED TO CLEAN UP SOME STUFF

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:28.731
AND WE NEED TO CLARIFY SOME

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:31.234
THINGS ARE AND THE THE REALITY

00:59:31.301 --> 00:59:32.268
IS IS THAT A LOT OF THESE ROLE

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.404
LOYALTY REWARDS PROGRAMS EXIST.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:35.905

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.877

THAT WE HAVE.

01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:44.907
IN THE WAY THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:48.143
HOW HOW THINGS CAN BE TRACKED.

01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:50.145
HOW WE KNOW WHERE LOCATIONS ARE

01:10:50.212 --> 01:10:51.547
THE PURCHASES THAT YOU'RE MAKING

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.282
THE WAY THAT ADVERTISING CAN BE

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:55.250
TARGETED DIRECTLY YOU YOU JUST

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:56.885
PURCHASED SOMETHING OUT A STORE?

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.358
ITEM SHOWS UP.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.993
ON YOUR FEET.

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:05.861
WITH THAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY I

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.263
DON'T THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.398
FOR A SOCIAL MEDIA SITE TO

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:11.467

THIS AND MANY OTHER INSTANCES

01:11:24.647 --> 01:11:26.382
PROBABLY THE MOST PREVALENT IS

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.684
WITH TOBACCO USE RIGHT WE'VE

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:30.519

IS IS LEGALLY.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:12:00.382
ABLE TO HAVE THAT PRODUCT -- SO

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.517
AGAIN WE'RE DOING THIS AND MANY

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:02.885
OTHER ASPECTS.

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.620

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:09.591
THE WAY THAT THIS IS IMPACTED

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.794

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:14.463

I I STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:42.177

SUGGESTION AS THE BILL MOVES

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.850
FORWARD OF A WAY THAT THAT MIGHT

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:48.817
MAKE IT BETTER.

01:14:48.884 --> 01:14:50.686
THE BILL'S IS PRETTY STARK IT

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:52.788
SAYS THAT THE BUSINESS SHALL NOT

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:55.123
ALLOW A PERSON UNDER NOW IT'S

01:14:55.190 --> 01:14:55.757
THIRTEEN YEARS OF AGE TO CREATE

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:57.092
AN ACCOUNT.

01:14:57.159 --> 01:14:57.993
SO.

01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:59.428
THE PROBLEM IS THAT A BUSINESS

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.230
REALLY HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING FOR

01:15:01.296 --> 01:15:02.297
SURE.

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:05.367
THAT SOMEONE'S THIRTEEN OR OR

01:15:05.434 --> 01:15:06.201
OLDER.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.469
SO I'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:08.503
IF IT THERE WAS LANGUAGE LIKE

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.139
SHALL TAKE REASONABLE STEPS OR

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.374
ME EVEN TIGHTER THAN THAT BUT I

01:15:12.441 --> 01:15:13.141
MEAN JUST.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:15.010
BUT YOU USED YOU RAISE THE THE

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.478
EXAMPLE OF YOUR DAUGHTER LYING

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:18.113
AND SAYING SHE WAS TWENTY ONE

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.081
OKAY SO MAYBE.

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.482
THE MAYBE THE THE THOUGH THAT

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:22.217
WASN'T A STRONG ENOUGH STANDARD

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:24.152
THAT THE THAT THE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.320
SITE WAS USING.

01:15:25.387 --> 01:15:26.655
BUT I MEAN LET'S SAY THAT THEY

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.290
ASK FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:29.691
NUMBERS SO SHE STOLE HER MOTHERS

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:30.893
AND PUT IT IN THERE OKAY IS THAT

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:32.427
A REASONABLE STEP.

01:15:32.494 --> 01:15:32.995
BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BAR

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.631
THERE IT WHICH WE SAY THAT THE

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:39.234
BUSINESS HAS MET THAT BAR.

01:15:39.301 --> 01:15:40.736
YOU KNOW AND AND IF.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:41.970
THE SOMEONE THAT WASN'T THIRTEEN

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:42.604
OPEN AN ACCOUNT THAT YOU KNOW

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:44.306
THE BUSINESS WASN'T AT FAULT

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:44.773
THERE BECAUSE THEY DID

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.774
EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD.

01:15:45.841 --> 01:15:47.476
SO -- I I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE

01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.311

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.888
BE DONE YOU KNOW FROM THAT

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.790

WITH EVERYTHING THAT I'VE SEEN.

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:06.595
I FIND HARD TO BELIEVE THEY

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.130
WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME KIND

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.998
OF MECHANISM.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.433

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.252
REASONABLE AND IS MET THE

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:31.386
STANDARD OF THE BILL.

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:34.890
WITHOUT SAYING THAT ANYTHING

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:35.524
THAT GETS THROUGH THE BUSINESSES

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.758

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:46.401
IT'S GREAT NOW BUT AS SOON AS

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.270
OLDER AND START GOING TO SCHOOL

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:49.638

TABLET OR PHONE OR ANY TYPE OF

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.409
DEVICE -- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.278
THAT A BECAUSE THE INFORMATION

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.046
THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPOSED TO

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:00.349
AS GOOD AS I MAY THINK I AM AT

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.417
AT AT CENSORING THEM JUST LIKE

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:03.051
MY DAD THOUGHT HE WAS GOOD AT

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:04.319
CENSORING US WHEN IT CAME TO

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.721

YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE TO PUT IN

01:17:06.688 --> 01:17:08.590
THE CODE TO WATCH MOVIES ABOUT

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:12.260
AT OUR WHATEVER IT WAS AND YOU

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:13.362
KNOW.

01:17:13.428 --> 01:17:14.463
IN A DEAD YOU DON'T REMEMBER A

01:17:14.529 --> 01:17:15.630
LOT OF THINGS IT'S CLEARLY YOUR

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:20.302
BIRTHDAY -- NINETEEN FIFTY BUT

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.137
IT YET I I BUT I BUT I AM

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:24.806
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HOW THE HELL

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.675
COMPANIES -- WHAT THE WHAT THE

01:17:26.742 --> 01:17:27.843
LIABILITY IS AND HOW COMPANIES

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:30.512
IT CAN POSSIBLY BE ABLE -- TO TO

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:32.247
RISE TO THE STANDARD OF BEING

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.982
ABLE TO GUARANTEE THAT A KID WHO

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.117
WAS IN THIRTEEN IS AGAIN IT IS

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:36.618
IS IS GETTING A PARENTAL CONSENT

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:37.619
AYE AYE.

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.854
I MEAN I WANT TO BELIEVE IT'S

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.088
POSSIBLE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:41.356
POSSIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW AND SO

01:17:41.423 --> 01:17:42.657
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IT WE HAVE

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:43.792
TO BE CAREFUL IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:44.393
LIABILITY WILL PLACE ON THE

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.193
COMPANY.

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:46.661
AS WELL AS THE STANDARD BECAUSE

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.163

IT'S NOT THAT IT'S THE PLATFORMS

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:03.678
FAULT IT'S THAT THE PEOPLE THAT

WITH COMMON SENSE MEDIA CO

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:36.190
SPONSOR OF THE CCPA --

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:37.792
RESPECTFULLY WE MUST OPPOSE THE

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:39.994
BILL AS AS DRAFTED IN AS AMENDED

01:31:40.061 --> 01:31:41.195
AS AS DETAILED OUR POSITION

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.697
LETTER WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS

01:31:42.763 --> 01:31:43.764
NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.032
ANALYSIS.

01:31:45.099 --> 01:31:47.435
WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO

01:31:47.501 --> 01:31:50.171
HAVE A NON INTERNET WAY TO

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:52.273
CONTACT BUSINESS UNDER THE CCPA

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.441
CONSUMERS GET A NUMBER OF NEW

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:54.475
RIGHTS.

01:31:54.542 --> 01:31:56.110
THEY CAN ASK FOR IT THEY CAN ASK

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.279
BUSINESSES TOP SELLING AT THEY

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.814
CAN ASK A BUSINESS TO DELETE IT.

01:31:59.881 --> 01:32:01.215
BUT THEY HAVE TO EXERCISE THESE

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:02.183
RIGHTS THEY HAVE TO

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.351
AFFIRMATIVELY A START BUTTON AND

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:04.886
THE CCPA WAS DRAFTED TO MAKE

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.954
THAT PROCESS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:08.356
REQUIRING AT LEAST TWO POINTS OF

01:32:08.422 --> 01:32:10.291
CONTACT. TO ENSURE THAT USER

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.493
RIGHTS CAN ACTUALLY BE

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.362
MEANINGFULLY EXERCISED. ONE OF

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:15.263
THOSE POINTS OF CONTACT ON THIS

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:19.133
CCPA AS A TOLL FREE TELEPHONE

01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:19.967
NUMBER.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:20.768
AND THE KEY PART HERE I THINK IS

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.104
THAT IT IS A TELEPHONE NUMBER.

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.239
AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THAT.

01:32:25.306 --> 01:32:27.041
THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:30.645
CONSUMERS TO CONTACT BUSINESSES.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.179
REGARDING POSTAL MAIL ALSO KNOWN

01:32:32.246 --> 01:32:33.948
AS A SNAIL MAIL BECAUSE IT TAKES

01:32:34.015 --> 01:32:36.017
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:40.922
BUT THIS IS NOT A SUFFICIENT --

01:32:40.988 --> 01:32:42.523
THIS DOES NOT WOULD NOT REPLACE

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:43.991
THE TELEPHONE NUMBER.

01:32:44.058 --> 01:32:45.393
AND SHE DOESN'T SEVENTEEN NEARLY

SIXTY FIVE AND OVER.

01:32:48.462 --> 01:32:49.597
AND ADULTS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:50.564

ROUGHLY THREE IN TEN ADULTS WITH

01:32:53.801 --> 01:32:56.037
LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES UNDER

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:58.773
DO NOT ON SMARTPHONES IN ORDER

01:32:58.839 --> 01:32:59.573
FOR THESE PEOPLE THAT MEANING

01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.242
FLEA EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS THEY

01:33:01.309 --> 01:33:02.476
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE A PHONE

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:04.979
CALL 95% OF AMERICANS HAVE

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.681
ACCESS TO A SOFT ON INFORMATION

01:33:06.747 --> 01:33:07.648
OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:08.683
COLLECTED BOUGHT AND SOLD JUST

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:09.984
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE'S.

01:33:10.051 --> 01:33:10.584
AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.153
EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS BY MAKING

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:13.821
A CALL AND NOT HAVE TO SEND

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.389
SOMETHING IN THE MAIL AND HOPE

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:17.625
THAT SOME DAY ARRIVES AND HOPE

01:33:17.692 --> 01:33:18.192
THAT SOMEDAY THAT THEY GET A

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.126

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:21.128

THANK YOU MY CHáVEZ TIONAL

01:33:22.697 --> 01:33:25.533

I WANT TO STATE FOR THE RECORD

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:29.470
THAT -- THE OPPOSITION LETTERS

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:31.372
WERE DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS OF

01:33:31.439 --> 01:33:33.441
THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE THAT --

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:35.843
THEY ARRIVED LATE SO THAT'S THE

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:37.244
REASON WE DID NOT INCLUDE THEM

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:39.046
IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.848
AND OUT SO WITH THAT I I THINK

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:41.949
THIS IS A BILL THAT WE COULD

01:33:42.016 --> 01:33:44.051
ACTUALLY UP BILL COMPROMISE SON

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:48.489
I THINK TAUGHT SO IT'S A IT'S A

01:33:48.556 --> 01:33:49.423
IS IS NOT REALLY.

01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:50.257

CONSIDERING THE FACT THIS IS THE

01:34:04.171 --> 01:34:05.573
FIRST COMMITTEE SO I I FEEL VERY

MUST OPPOSE THE LANGUAGE RIGHT

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:28.348
NOW AS IT IS DRAFTED -- WE AGREE

01:46:28.415 --> 01:46:29.783
THAT THERE IS A DISTINCTION

01:46:29.850 --> 01:46:31.318
BETWEEN AN EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE

01:46:31.384 --> 01:46:33.620

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:47.734
DRAFTED.

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:50.103
THERE IS FAR TOO MUCH SPACE FOR

01:46:50.170 --> 01:46:52.806
INDUSTRY TO ABUSE THE OPENING

01:46:52.873 --> 01:46:53.840
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN THAT

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.742
WE THINK THAT ANY EXCEPTION

01:46:55.809 --> 01:46:57.210
SHOULD APPLY ONLY TO INFORMATION.

01:46:57.277 --> 01:46:59.546
THAT'S NECESSARY FOR AN EMPLOYER

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:01.548

WITHOUT A REQUIREMENT THAT

THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE PLANNING TO

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:29.776
CONCEIVE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT

01:47:29.843 --> 01:47:31.545
EMPLOYERS FEEL FREE TO TIE JUST

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:33.480
ABOUT ALL TYPES OF INFORMATION.

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:34.915
TO EMPLOYMENT SO THE RISK OF

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:36.817
ABUSE IS REAL IN ADDITION UNDER

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:38.118

01:56:19.605 --> 01:56:22.542
THIS BILL TAKES THATSEVERAL

01:56:22.608 --> 01:56:23.643
STEPS FURTHER AND SAYS.

THERE ARE SOME SPECIAL

HAVE WITH THE BILL IS THAT.

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:36.923
THIS POLICY WHICH IS IN PLACE

01:56:36.989 --> 01:56:37.490
FOR THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY

PATROL CREATES A SITUATION WHERE

01:56:39.959 --> 01:56:41.627
DATA THAT COULD BE USED TO HELP

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:42.929

SUSPECT'S WHEREABOUTS.

01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.136
ON A PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD.

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:51.804
WE'LL BE RENDERED USELESS IF

01:56:51.871 --> 01:56:53.439
THIS IF THESE DATA CAN ONLY BE

01:56:53.506 --> 01:56:55.007
KEPT FOR SIXTY DAYS YOU MAY HAVE

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:56.609
A SITUATION WHERE THREE MONTHS

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:57.710
FOUR YEARS DOWN THE LINE YOU

01:56:57.777 --> 01:56:59.078
HAVE A CASE.

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.613
AND YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHETHER

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:02.148
OR NOT THIS PARTICULAR PERSON

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:04.450
WEATHER IS A SUSPECT OR A VICTIM

01:57:04.517 --> 01:57:05.885
OR WHOMEVER.

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:07.120
MAY HAVE BEEN IN A PARTICULAR

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:09.589
LOCATION AND IF THERE IS A HELP

01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:11.023
YOUR DATA THAT CAN ILLUMINATE

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:12.058
THAT SITUATION.

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:14.527
THIS BILL WOULD EFFECTIVELY LEAD

01:57:14.594 --> 01:57:15.962
TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THOSE DATA

01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:17.897
FAR BEFORE THEY MIGHT BE USEFUL

01:57:17.964 --> 01:57:19.799
IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS WE

01:57:19.866 --> 01:57:20.400
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:57:20.466 --> 01:57:21.434
PRIVACY.

01:57:21.501 --> 01:57:22.368
AND WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:24.904
TAKING AMENDMENTS THAT ATTEMPT

01:57:24.971 --> 01:57:25.805
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:27.039
BUT THE REALITY IS PUTTING A

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:28.141
TIME LINE.

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:29.909
MEANS THAT AT SOME POINT THESE

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.377
DATA WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE

01:57:31.444 --> 01:57:33.179
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE FOR

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.647
THE PURPOSES OF SOLVING CRIMES.

01:57:34.714 --> 01:57:36.082
AND SO FOR THE RECENT THOSE

01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:37.417
REASONS WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL.

01:57:37.483 --> 01:57:39.285
THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL

01:57:39.352 --> 01:57:40.887
WITNESSES OPPOSITION.

01:57:40.953 --> 01:57:43.389
MEMBERS THE PUBLIC OPPOSITION.

01:57:43.456 --> 01:57:44.891
SING ON BRINGING BACK THE MEDI

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:49.862
ANY QUESTIONS -- SO MY FIRST

01:57:49.929 --> 01:57:52.465
QUESTION IS THE CURRENT LAW AND

01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:54.300
CONTAINS AN EXCEPTION AROUND.

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:55.835
KEEPING IT KEEPING THE DATA FOR

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:56.969
INVESTIGATIONS I DON'T SEE THAT

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:58.204
IN THE CURRENT STATUTES MY

01:57:58.271 --> 01:57:59.872
CONCERN IS THAT THAT WOULD ONLY

01:57:59.939 --> 01:58:01.441
APPLY TO THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:03.342
OTHER DIVISIONS IS THAT.

01:58:03.409 --> 01:58:05.144
MY READING CORRECT NO THE INTENT

01:58:05.211 --> 01:58:07.146
IS -- ADDITIONALLY -- AND APPLY

01:58:07.213 --> 01:58:10.683
THE SAME LAW TO BOTH SIXTY AND

01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:11.584
OTHER LIFE WAS MADE UC'S SO TO

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:12.618
THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS ANY.

01:58:12.685 --> 01:58:14.320
ARE OVERSIGHT IN THE DRAFTING

01:58:14.387 --> 01:58:15.888
LANGUAGE THEN WE WANT TO FIX IT

01:58:15.955 --> 01:58:17.523
BECAUSE THE IDEA IS TO ALL YOU

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:18.257
KNOW.

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:19.759
WE HAVE A CONSISTENCY BETWEEN

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.160
LET'S SAY THE H. SIX P. AND

01:58:21.227 --> 01:58:22.728
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

01:58:22.795 --> 01:58:25.431
SO OB TO I UNDERSTAND TO SEIZE

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.099
CAN RETAIN THE INFORMATION FOR

01:58:27.166 --> 01:58:28.367
LONGER THAN SIXTY DAYS IF THERE

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:30.336
ISN'T SOME KIND OF INVESTIGATION

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:32.772
GOING ON SO WE WANTED THE SAME --

01:58:32.839 --> 01:58:35.074
PROCEDURES IN AND RIGHTS TO BE

01:58:35.141 --> 01:58:35.908
FORTY TWO OTHER LINES OF LAW

01:58:35.975 --> 01:58:37.510
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AS WELL.

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:39.212
SO I LIKE I WASN'T MADE AWARE OF

01:58:39.278 --> 01:58:42.014
THAT PARTICULAR ON SHORT COMING

01:58:42.081 --> 01:58:44.283
UNTIL TODAY SO WE WILL FIX IT TO

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:48.354
MAKE SURE THAT SO IT WILL

01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:49.489
PROVIDE FOR THAT EXCEPTION FOR

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:51.524
INVESTIGATION TO CONTINUE GOING

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:53.593
ON TO TO ONE OF THE ISSUES WAS

01:58:53.659 --> 01:58:55.561
UP YOU KNOW WE WE WERE EXPECTING --

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:56.696
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE AT THE

01:58:56.762 --> 01:58:57.797
TABLE BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL

01:58:57.864 --> 01:58:59.232
RECENTLY THAT YOU FOLKS ARE AT

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.533
THE TABLE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT

01:59:00.600 --> 01:59:01.834
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:03.603
AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:05.304
BECAUSE WE WE WEREN'T GETTING

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:06.539
ANY RESPONSES FROM LAW

01:59:06.606 --> 01:59:09.041
ENFORCEMENT WHATSOEVER.

01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:10.977
SO -- IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:12.178
KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD

01:59:12.245 --> 01:59:13.746
LIKE FIRST TO TWEAK THE A FEW

01:59:13.813 --> 01:59:15.047
FREE TO DO SO BUT THE INTENT

01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:17.550
AGAIN TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS.

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:18.851
TO YOU KNOW APPLY THE SAME ALL

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:21.220
TO BOTH SIEGE BE AND ALSO ON THE

01:59:21.287 --> 01:59:21.721
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

01:59:21.787 --> 01:59:22.021
[inaudible]

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:24.524
ON I APPRECIATE THE OBVIOUS IT'S

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:26.125
IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS LAST

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:28.928
SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER THAN SIXTY

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:30.730
DAYS.

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:31.364
SO THEY HAVE AN ELDER CHAIN THAT

01:59:31.430 --> 01:59:33.332
INFORMATION -- SO MY QUESTION IS

01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:35.201
AND THIS IS A TECHNICAL QUESTION

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:36.068
WHICH YOU MAY OR MAY NOT ANSWER

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:36.969
TO IS IT POSSIBLE BECAUSE ONE OF

01:59:37.036 --> 01:59:37.637
THINGS ALLOWS FOR IS THE

01:59:37.703 --> 01:59:39.539
RETENTION OF THE DAY TO BE ON

01:59:39.605 --> 01:59:42.141
THE SIXTY DAYS IF IT'S THE

01:59:42.208 --> 01:59:42.408
ANONYMOUS.

01:59:42.475 --> 01:59:43.910
I THINK I THAT RIGHT -- IS IT

01:59:43.976 --> 01:59:46.612
POSSIBLE TO THEN RETAIN THE DATA

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.381
IN A D. ANONYMIZED FASHION AND

01:59:48.447 --> 01:59:52.652
USE IT AT A LATER DATE FOR AN

01:59:52.718 --> 01:59:54.554
INVESTIGATION BY.

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:57.323
ANONYMOUS THING IT YEAH THE

01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:59.058
DETAILED THE LANGUAGE KILEY SAYS

01:59:59.125 --> 01:59:59.258
THAT.

01:59:59.325 --> 02:00:00.626
IF THEY DO NOT ANONYMIZED

02:00:00.693 --> 02:00:02.628
INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE TO

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:03.462
DELETE IT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:04.931
RIGHT GIVEN THAT CAMBIADO TO

02:00:04.997 --> 02:00:05.464
MENTION EARLIER.

02:00:05.531 --> 02:00:06.332
I'M SO IF THEY WANT TO TRANSFER

02:00:06.399 --> 02:00:08.100
THE DATA TO ANOTHER AGENCY OR

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.602
OTHER IN THE TEETH AND THE NEED

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:10.570
TO AN ITEMIZED OUT DATA.

02:00:10.636 --> 02:00:11.170
AND IF THE ANONYMOUS AGAIN AND

02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:11.804
AGAIN TAKE IT OUT OF THAT IF

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:13.105
THEY WERE TO BE IN A SITUATION

02:00:13.172 --> 02:00:13.806
SUCH AS MISTRESS HAS A LOW

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.041
DESCRIBES WHERE THEY WANTED TO

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.242
DO AN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF

02:00:16.309 --> 02:00:18.611
OTHER CRIMES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED

02:00:18.678 --> 02:00:19.245
IN A SIMILAR.

02:00:19.312 --> 02:00:20.546
WAY THAT'S HOW THE LANGUAGE IS

02:00:20.613 --> 02:00:21.681
CURRENTLY DRAFTED SO THAT WOULD

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:26.519
BE POP TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE.

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:26.719
I YES.

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:29.121
OKAY.

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:29.956
A COUPLE THANK YOU I THINK THAT

02:00:30.022 --> 02:00:31.791
THAT'S TECHNICALLY OF DO YOU

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:32.825
HAVE A RESPONSE I WAS FOR

02:00:32.892 --> 02:00:33.059
SEVERAL.

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:33.726
THROUGH THE CHAIR I I DON'T KNOW

02:00:33.793 --> 02:00:34.327
HOW THAT WOULD BE PHYSICALLY

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:35.895
POSSIBLE I MEAN EFFECTIVELY THE

02:00:35.962 --> 02:00:37.129
DATA THAT ARE CAPPED IS A

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:38.130
LICENSE PLATE NUMBER YOU KNOW

02:00:38.197 --> 02:00:38.831
ABC.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:39.365
ONE TWO THREE AND THEN A

02:00:39.432 --> 02:00:40.967
LOCATION AT A TIME THERE'S

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:42.101
REALLY NO OTHER DATA THAT YOU

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:43.336
CAN ATTACH TO IT.

02:00:43.402 --> 02:00:44.870
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LPR

02:00:44.937 --> 02:00:46.205
CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

02:00:46.272 --> 02:00:48.140
RUNNING AGAINST ANY DMV DATABASE

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:49.742
SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:50.977
INFORMATION.

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:53.045
SO IN ORDER TO ANONYMIZE IT YOUR

02:00:53.112 --> 02:00:55.281
AFFECTED LEE I THINK THE HOUSE

02:00:55.348 --> 02:00:56.115
IS POINTS THIS OUT IN THE FORMER

02:00:56.182 --> 02:00:56.382
COMMITTEE.

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:57.650
YOU HAVE TO SCRAMBLE THE PLATE

02:00:57.717 --> 02:00:59.051
NUMBER OF THE CHARACTERISTICS I

02:00:59.118 --> 02:01:00.987
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU.

02:01:01.053 --> 02:01:02.788
I MEAN I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S PUT

02:01:02.855 --> 02:01:04.457
INTO LIKE A ROSE IN.

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:06.125
A STATE WHERE THE LINES INTO

02:01:06.192 --> 02:01:08.260
LET'S NOT THE BILL DOESN'T SEEM

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:10.429
TO CONTEMPLATE BUT A HOST YOU

02:01:10.496 --> 02:01:11.297
WOULD DO IT.

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:12.965
IN AND AND TO THE POINT ABOUT

02:01:13.032 --> 02:01:19.171
THE SIXTY DAYS WE WE AGREE THAT

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:19.772
WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD

02:01:19.839 --> 02:01:22.508
BE -- COMPATIBLE WITH EXISTING

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:24.210
LAW THAT APPLIES THE SIEGE BE

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:26.178
BUT WERE OPPOSED TO THAT STILL.

02:01:26.245 --> 02:01:27.446
EVEN EVEN THOUGH THE LANGUAGE.

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:28.114
THAT.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:29.482
IF THERE'S INVESTIGATION PENDING

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:31.484
OR IN CONNECTION WITH A FELONY

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:33.352
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THAT SIXTY DAYS

02:01:33.419 --> 02:01:34.286
SO IT'S HELPFUL TO BE SURE.

02:01:34.353 --> 02:01:35.221
BUT IT DOESN'T GET OUT THE

02:01:35.287 --> 02:01:36.589
SITUATION I DESCRIBED WHICH IS

02:01:36.656 --> 02:01:37.189
THREE YEARS FROM NOW WE DON'T

02:01:37.256 --> 02:01:39.058
HAVE INVESTIGATION PENDING AND

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:41.093
THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND YOU

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:42.294
HAVE SOMETHING THAT COMES AND

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:43.663
SAYS -- WE HAVE THIS COLD CASE

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:44.163
BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:45.364
INVESTIGATION.

02:01:45.431 --> 02:01:46.666
YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CALL

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:51.604
BACK THE DATA BECAUSE THEY WOULD

02:01:51.671 --> 02:01:52.972
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:53.939
SO I MEAN I'M SORRY I'M LOOKING

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:54.974
AT MY COLLEAGUES TO MY RATE

AFTER SIX YEARS I SEE THE

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.796
CONCERN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT -- I

02:02:16.862 --> 02:02:18.731
WOULD LOVE THE IDEA OF A

02:02:18.798 --> 02:02:20.166
COMPROMISE WHERE WE COULD.

02:02:20.232 --> 02:02:21.400
ANONYMIZE IT AND THEN IF

02:02:21.467 --> 02:02:22.935
NECESSARY LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:24.737
CLYDE BACK VERSUS HAVING THIS

02:02:24.804 --> 02:02:25.871
DATA SITTING OUT THERE AND

02:02:25.938 --> 02:02:27.306
ESPECIALLY GIVEN I SEE THE

02:02:27.373 --> 02:02:28.841
BENEFITS ALONG FORCE MAN I AM

02:02:28.908 --> 02:02:30.009
CONCERNED WITH THE SALE OF THIS

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:31.744

02:02:31.811 --> 02:02:32.445
REPORT.

02:02:32.511 --> 02:02:33.979
AND SO CAN WE FIND THE HAPPY

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:35.715
MEDIUM BETWEEN PROTECTING OUR

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:37.116

AND I I WOULD.

02:02:42.221 --> 02:02:43.856
LIKE TO KNOW IF THAT WAS

02:02:43.923 --> 02:02:47.827
TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE.

02:02:47.893 --> 02:02:50.262
THANK YOU MISTER.

02:02:50.329 --> 02:02:50.863
ONE I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA

02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:52.131
ANSWER THAT I I THINK I MEAN THE

02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:52.565
IDEA WITH.

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:53.999
WITH ANONYMIZING DATA IS THAT IT

02:02:54.066 --> 02:02:55.301
CANNOT BE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.669
BE ABLE TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER

02:02:56.736 --> 02:02:59.105
SO IF YOU WERE TO KEEP IT AFTER

02:02:59.171 --> 02:03:01.340
SIXTY DAYS YOU WOULD ENCRYPTED.

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:03.876
AND BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.377
THE BILL PROBABLY DISCUSSION

BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THE WHOLE

02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:17.123
POINT OF ANONYMIZING THE DATA.

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.624
IS SO THAT YOU DISSOCIATE THE

02:03:18.691 --> 02:03:20.559
IDENTITY WITH THE DATA AND IF

02:03:20.626 --> 02:03:21.193
THERE WAS A WAY OF PUTTING IT

02:03:21.260 --> 02:03:22.528
BACK TOGETHER THAT WOULD DEFEAT

02:03:22.595 --> 02:03:24.730
THE PURPOSE OF HAVING ANONYMIZED

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:26.165
AT THE FIRST PLACE.

02:03:26.232 --> 02:03:27.366
BUT I'M OPEN TO HAVING -- THE

02:03:27.433 --> 02:03:29.201
DATA BEING AN ENCRYPTED AS WELL

02:03:29.268 --> 02:03:29.835
I MEAN I'VE GOT SOMETHING THAT

02:03:29.902 --> 02:03:32.004
LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WILLING AND

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:33.839
ABLE TO DO -- SO I YOU KNOW I'M

SO WE WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO

02:03:41.413 --> 02:03:41.914
TO TO DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS I

02:03:41.981 --> 02:03:43.649
THINK THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:46.318

DURING THIS PROCESS OF WORKING

IN ADDITION THE RECEIPT PAPER IS

02:24:12.443 --> 02:24:13.544
VERY DIFFICULT TO RECYCLE

02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:15.046
BECAUSE OF ITS VERY SMALL SIZE

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:17.415
AND BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY THEY

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.517

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:33.097
TO CREATE THE PAPER RECEIPTS SO

02:24:33.164 --> 02:24:34.198
AGAIN WE THINK THAT WE CAN

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:36.034
UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES MUCH

02:24:36.100 --> 02:24:39.237

02:24:58.289 --> 02:24:58.656
REDUCTION.

02:24:58.723 --> 02:25:00.691
AND THAT'S ITEM THAT THE

CONSUMER SAYS THEY DO NOT WANT.

02:25:03.394 --> 02:25:04.562

02:27:39.317 --> 02:27:41.152
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND WASTE

02:27:41.219 --> 02:27:42.587
REDUCTION AND AT THE SAME TIME.

02:27:42.653 --> 02:27:44.088
OF PROTECTING -- CONSUMER

02:27:44.155 --> 02:27:45.723

IF I COULD TO ASK THAT WE CLEAR

02:28:12.683 --> 02:28:15.152
SOME ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION ANY

02:28:15.219 --> 02:28:17.688
TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE COMING UP

02:28:17.755 --> 02:28:17.989
[inaudible]

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:24.562
WELCOME. FIFTY TO PROCEED.

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:25.563
TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:26.697
MEMBERS MY NAME'S MATT SATIN ON

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.199
WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT

02:28:28.266 --> 02:28:29.700
ASSOCIATION.

02:28:29.767 --> 02:28:30.901
WE'RE NOT HERE TO DEFEND

02:28:30.968 --> 02:28:32.803
RECEIPTS BUT WE ARE HERE TO

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.306
OBJECT TO A MANDATE FOR CERTAIN

02:28:35.373 --> 02:28:37.041
TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY -- TO BE PUT

02:28:37.108 --> 02:28:38.142
IN THE FOUR WALLS OF A

02:28:38.209 --> 02:28:39.477
RESTAURANT AND THAT'S THE WAY WE

02:28:39.543 --> 02:28:40.978
READ THE BILL THE BILL DOES

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:43.047
REQUIRE THAT WE MOVED TO AN

02:28:43.114 --> 02:28:44.482
ELECTRONIC RECEIPT PLATFORM AS

02:28:44.548 --> 02:28:45.883
FAR AS I UNDERSTAND EVEN WITH

02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:46.984
THE AMENDMENTS.

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:49.787
AND SO WE ARE FORCED TO MAINTAIN

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:51.455
THE TRADITIONAL PAPER RECEIPT

02:28:51.522 --> 02:28:53.124
SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT AN ISSUE --

02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:55.826
BUT ALSO WE MUST HAVE THE

02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:57.928
ELECTRONIC RECEIPT TECHNOLOGY

02:28:57.995 --> 02:28:59.730
AND THAT PATHWAY -- UNDER THE

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:01.799
BILL AND SO THAT IS A MANDATE

02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:03.067
FOR A CERTAIN TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY

02:29:03.134 --> 02:29:04.769
WITHIN RESTAURANTS MANY

02:29:04.835 --> 02:29:06.504
RESTAURANTS ARE NOT THERE YET IT

02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:08.139
IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE RETAIL

02:29:08.205 --> 02:29:09.573
AND RESTAURANT ESTABLISHMENTS --

02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:11.442
THEY DO HAVE -- ELECTRONIC

02:29:11.509 --> 02:29:13.511
RECEIPT CAPABILITIES BUT IT'S

02:29:13.577 --> 02:29:15.813
INCREDIBLY COSTLY IT'S COSTLY

02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:17.815
FOR RESTAURANTS -- AND SO WE

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:19.350
LIKE I SAID REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN

02:29:19.417 --> 02:29:21.352
BOTH AVENUES SO THAT IS A POINT

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:24.288
OF OBJECTION -- AND THEN THERE

02:29:24.355 --> 02:29:26.290
IS THE ISSUE WITH RESTAURANTS

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:26.924
WHETHER THEY'RE IN A FRANCHISE

02:29:26.991 --> 02:29:29.727
MODEL MANY OF THE FRANCHISE

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:32.129
CONTRACTS WITH THE FRANCHISEE.

02:29:32.196 --> 02:29:33.831
THEY DO STIPULATE THAT THESE

02:29:33.898 --> 02:29:36.033
TYPES OF COSTS HAVE TO BE BORN

02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:37.501
AND ACCEPTED IN ABSORBED BY THE

02:29:37.568 --> 02:29:39.537
ACTUAL INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEES SO

02:29:39.603 --> 02:29:41.372
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS JUST ON

02:29:41.439 --> 02:29:42.673
BIG BUSINESS -- IT COULD NOT BE

02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:43.908
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH WHEN IT

02:29:43.974 --> 02:29:45.676
COMES TO RESTAURANTS AND THEN

02:29:45.743 --> 02:29:46.344
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:47.845
OUT TO YOU -- WHICH WAS

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.280
INFORMATION TO ME WHICH IS MANY

02:29:49.347 --> 02:29:50.815
RESTAURANTS ACTUALLY ARE LEASING

02:29:50.881 --> 02:29:52.216
THE EQUIPMENT THEY'RE LEASING

02:29:52.283 --> 02:29:53.784
THE POINT OF SALE SYSTEM SO

02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:55.686
THEY'RE LOCKED INTO A CONTRACT.

02:29:55.753 --> 02:29:57.655
FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME -- AND

02:29:57.722 --> 02:29:59.523
THAT WILL BE IN PLACE WHEN THIS

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:01.659
BILL COMES IN WITH THE MANDATE --

02:30:01.726 --> 02:30:02.326
TO GO TO ANOTHER TYPE OF

02:30:02.393 --> 02:30:04.362
TECHNOLOGY SO FOR US IT IT

02:30:04.428 --> 02:30:05.996
REALLY IS BOILING DOWN TO

02:30:06.063 --> 02:30:07.431
REQUIRING US TO HAVE THAT

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:09.400
TECHNOLOGY IT'S INCREDIBLY

02:30:09.467 --> 02:30:11.302
COSTLY FOR RESTAURANTS -- I

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:12.503
AGREE THAT OVER TIME THEY'RE

02:30:12.570 --> 02:30:14.372
GOING TO GET THERE BUT MOVING

02:30:14.438 --> 02:30:15.873
THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE IS JUST

02:30:15.940 --> 02:30:17.608
MOVING THE DATE AT WHICH WE ARE

02:30:17.675 --> 02:30:19.176
FORCED TO TAKE THAT --

02:30:19.243 --> 02:30:21.245
TECHNOLOGY I KNOW THERE ARE SOME

02:30:21.312 --> 02:30:25.316
EXEMPTIONS -- WITH REGARD TO THE

02:30:25.383 --> 02:30:26.450
MILLION DOLLARS IN GROSS

02:30:26.517 --> 02:30:27.585
RECEIPTS OR LESS -- BUT THAT

02:30:27.651 --> 02:30:29.019
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT'S

02:30:29.086 --> 02:30:30.421
A SMALL ENTITY OR SMALL

02:30:30.488 --> 02:30:31.956
RESTAURANT YOU CAN HAVE A SMALL

02:30:32.022 --> 02:30:33.457
RESTAURANT THAT HAS HIGH SALES

02:30:33.524 --> 02:30:35.659
VOLUME -- IN EASILY HIT THAT

02:30:35.726 --> 02:30:39.497
MARK SO THAT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:41.499
FOR OUR SMALL RESTAURANTS -- AND

02:30:41.565 --> 02:30:43.200
THEN OF COURSE THE ENFORCEMENT

02:30:43.267 --> 02:30:45.569
PIECE IS VERY CONCERNING -- IT

02:30:45.636 --> 02:30:47.204
YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY.

02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:49.140
ALLOWS FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT --

02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:51.108
DISTRICT ATTORNEYS -- AND CITY

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.643
ATTORNEYS AND THAT IS OF CONCERN

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:53.911
TO US BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS

02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:55.746
TO BECOME SORT OF A A NEW DRIVE

02:30:55.813 --> 02:30:57.615
BY LAWSUIT TYPE OF ISSUE -- THAT

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.983
WE FACED A NUMBER OF OTHER

02:30:59.049 --> 02:31:01.352
THINGS -- I'VE GOT LOTS OF OTHER

02:31:01.419 --> 02:31:02.887
THINGS BUT OF THE INTEREST OF

02:31:02.953 --> 02:31:03.521
TIME ALL LEAVE IT THERE MISTER

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:04.989

BUSINESS REPRESENTING ABOUT

02:31:10.761 --> 02:31:11.295
TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:13.097
OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE ALSO IN

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:14.765
OPPOSITION FOR MANY THE REASONS

02:31:14.832 --> 02:31:16.467
MISTER SUDDEN MENTION -- WE DO

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:17.701
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND

02:31:17.768 --> 02:31:19.670
APPRECIATE THE GOAL OF REDUCING

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:20.971
A PAPER WASTE AND PROTECTING

02:31:21.038 --> 02:31:23.040
HUMAN HEALTH -- ASIDE FROM THE

02:31:23.107 --> 02:31:24.542
SCIENCE AND THE FACTORS OF MANY

02:31:24.608 --> 02:31:26.243
OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND

02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:28.045
RAISED IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEE --

02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:29.346
OUR MEMBERS ARE REALLY CONCERNED

02:31:29.413 --> 02:31:30.681
WITH THE BOTTOM LINE OF

02:31:30.748 --> 02:31:33.017
INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY COSTS

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:34.885
TO ADOPT THIS -- MANDATE AND IT

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.320
IS IN OUR VIEW A MANDATE

02:31:36.387 --> 02:31:38.122
REQUIRING THE OPTION OF AN

02:31:38.189 --> 02:31:39.924
ELECTRONIC RECEIPT -- OUR

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:41.292
RESEARCH AND IF I BE RESEARCH

02:31:41.358 --> 02:31:42.927
HAS SHOWN -- THAT SMALL

02:31:42.993 --> 02:31:44.595
BUSINESSES SPENDING A DRASTIC

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:46.297
THIS PROPORTION AMOUNT OF TIME

02:31:46.363 --> 02:31:47.865
AND MONEY TO COMPLY.

02:31:47.932 --> 02:31:49.633
WITH REGULATIONS -- ROUGHLY

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:52.336
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HOURS AND

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:52.937
SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR SPENT

02:31:53.003 --> 02:31:54.839
ANNUALLY BY AND IF I BE MEMBERS

02:31:54.905 --> 02:31:56.273
THAT'S A NATIONAL SURVEY.

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:57.541
IN MANY CASES HIGHER HERE IN

02:31:57.608 --> 02:31:59.443
CALIFORNIA I CAN TELL YOU AND IF

02:31:59.510 --> 02:32:00.578
I THE MEMBERS ARE SMALL BUSINESS

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:02.146
OWNERS IN GENERAL ARE VERY

02:32:02.213 --> 02:32:03.647
BUSINESS BUSY RUNNING THEIR

02:32:03.714 --> 02:32:05.449
SMALL BUSINESS -- BUT I'VE

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:06.851
GOTTEN SO MANY PHONE CALLS

02:32:06.917 --> 02:32:08.853
SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE AND

02:32:08.919 --> 02:32:09.820
ACTUALLY BY THE BILL NUMBER

02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:11.655
WHICH IS VERY UNCOMMON -- FOR A

02:32:11.722 --> 02:32:13.157
LOT OF OUR ISSUES THEY'RE VERY

02:32:13.224 --> 02:32:14.391
CONCERNED THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:32:14.458 --> 02:32:15.392
ANXIETY ABOUT IT ONE MEMBER

02:32:15.459 --> 02:32:16.894
CALLED AND SAID IT WOULD COST

02:32:16.961 --> 02:32:18.662
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST

02:32:18.729 --> 02:32:19.430
TO GET.

02:32:19.497 --> 02:32:20.898
THE TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED JUST TO

02:32:20.965 --> 02:32:22.333
BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT ELECTRONIC

02:32:22.399 --> 02:32:24.235
RECEIPTS OTHERS COSTS AS WE

02:32:24.301 --> 02:32:25.870
MENTIONED -- AND THEN ALSO THE

02:32:25.936 --> 02:32:27.471
FEAR OF LITIGATION LITIGATIONS

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:28.839
OF COURSE EXPENSIVE FOR ANY

02:32:28.906 --> 02:32:30.140
BUSINESS BUT FOR SMALL

02:32:30.207 --> 02:32:31.842
BUSINESSES CAN BE CRIPPLING AND

02:32:31.909 --> 02:32:33.110
UNDER OF COURSE IN ADDITION ALL

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:34.745
THE CCPA QUESTIONS AND WE'VE

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:36.046
BEEN WORKING THROUGH.

02:32:36.113 --> 02:32:37.848
SOME OF THESE WITH THE AUTHOR --

02:32:37.915 --> 02:32:38.849
A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:40.684
VERY ANXIOUS AND CONCERNED ABOUT

02:32:40.751 --> 02:32:42.052
THE IDEA OF COLLECTING EMAIL

02:32:42.119 --> 02:32:42.987
ADDRESSES.

02:32:43.053 --> 02:32:44.488
EMAILING RECEIPTS HAVING TO

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:49.693
STORE THAT DATA AND IF THAT DATA

02:32:49.760 --> 02:32:51.529
WAS COMPROMISE IS THE LITIGATION

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:52.162
TRIES A HUGE CONCERN AS WELL AND

02:32:52.229 --> 02:32:52.830
THE QUESTION OF LIABILITY SO FOR

02:32:52.897 --> 02:32:53.464
THOSE REASONS AND MANY OTHERS.

02:32:53.531 --> 02:32:54.598
AS MISTER SUTTON SAID IN THE

02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:56.634
INTEREST OF TIME -- DOESN'T MAIN

02:32:56.700 --> 02:32:57.368
REASONS AND IF I BE AS GOOD

02:32:57.434 --> 02:32:58.769
OPPOSE AS WELL THANK YOU.

02:32:58.836 --> 02:33:01.171
THANK YOU VERY MUCH A NEXT

02:33:01.238 --> 02:33:03.040
WITNESS PLACE.

02:33:03.107 --> 02:33:04.108
WHICH TURN MEMBERS MARGARET LAST

02:33:04.174 --> 02:33:04.675
YOU KNOW HALF THE CALIFORNIA

02:33:04.742 --> 02:33:05.676
RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AT ONCE

02:33:05.743 --> 02:33:07.044
AGAIN I WOULD LIKE SPENT THANK

02:33:07.111 --> 02:33:08.379
YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS THE

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:10.514
AUTHORS OFFICE FOR TAKING THESE

02:33:10.581 --> 02:33:11.949
AMENDMENTS I HAVE SPENT A GREAT

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.083
DEAL TIME WITH YOUR STAFF ON A

02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.951
NUMBER OF BILLS AND HER LAST FEW.

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:17.021
WEEKS -- WE STILL REMAIN OPPOSED

02:33:17.087 --> 02:33:18.522
WE APPRECIATE THE NEW AMENDMENTS

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:19.957
THAT THE AUTHOR TOOK -- THEY'RE

02:33:20.024 --> 02:33:21.659
MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN

02:33:21.725 --> 02:33:23.360
MANY WAYS -- BUT THERE ARE

02:33:23.427 --> 02:33:24.962
SEVERAL ISSUES THAT I WE HAVE

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:27.398
CONCERNS ABOUT RECEIPTS ARE AND

02:33:27.464 --> 02:33:29.033
SOME SORT OF PROOF OF PURCHASE

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:30.568
ARE OFTEN USED FOR PRODUCT

02:33:30.634 --> 02:33:32.937
RETURNS AND FROM LOSS PREVENTION --

02:33:33.003 --> 02:33:35.339
IF I CUSTOMER CHOOSES TO RECEIVE

02:33:35.406 --> 02:33:39.243
NO RECEIPT AND THEN ULTIMATELY

02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:40.244
DECIDES.

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:41.045
TO RETURN AN ITEM.

02:33:41.111 --> 02:33:42.012
FINDING PROOF OF PURCHASE WILL

02:33:42.079 --> 02:33:44.582
BE AT CHALLENGING FOR COMFORT

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:47.084
STORES THAT REQUIRE THAT AND SO

02:33:47.151 --> 02:33:49.086
ADD TO THAT IS AN ISSUE FOR US

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:51.455

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:44.975
SOMETHING BECAUSE I USUALLY JUST

02:39:45.042 --> 02:39:46.643
USE MY CREDIT CARD THAT I USE TO

02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.178
PURCHASE THE ITEM TO TO VERIFY --

02:39:48.245 --> 02:39:49.913
THAT I DID BUY THE ITEM THERE

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:52.316
AND AND AND THEY CAN LOOK THAT

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:52.883
UP JUST THROUGH RUNNING THE

02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:54.184
CREDIT CARD THAT I USE THAT THE

02:39:54.251 --> 02:39:56.086
AT THE POINT OF PURCHASE -- YOU

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:58.755
KNOW I I KNOW THAT.

02:39:58.822 --> 02:40:00.290
MADE IN MY THAT THERE COULD BE

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:01.525
OTHERS BUT IN TERMS OF GROCERY

02:40:01.591 --> 02:40:03.727
STORES COSCO IS THE ONLY ONE

02:40:03.794 --> 02:40:05.395
THAT I CAN REALLY THINK OF OFF

02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:06.697
THE TOP OF MY HEAD THAT REALLY

02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:08.899
USES A RECEIPT -- TO VERIFY

02:40:08.966 --> 02:40:10.467
BEFORE EVERYBODY LEAVES THAT YOU

02:40:10.534 --> 02:40:11.568
KNOW YOU REALLY DID PURCHASE THE

02:40:11.635 --> 02:40:12.469
IN FOR A YEAR REALLY DID

02:40:12.536 --> 02:40:14.004
PURCHASE THE PRODUCTS THAT.

02:40:14.071 --> 02:40:15.072
YOU'RE TRYING TO LEAVE THE STORE

02:40:15.138 --> 02:40:17.708
WITH AND SO -- YOU KNOW THAT

02:40:17.774 --> 02:40:18.742
NEED TO BE A CONCERN THAT NEEDS

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:20.043
TO BE ADDRESS ALTHOUGH I ALSO

02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:21.445
DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING

02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:26.383
THAT THEY CAN FIGURE OUT -- BUT%

02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:28.118
BUT BEING ABLE TO VERIFY.

02:40:28.185 --> 02:40:28.819
EVEN WITH AN ELECTRONIC RECEIPT --

02:40:28.885 --> 02:40:30.487
BEING ABLE TO VERIFY PROOF OF

02:40:30.554 --> 02:40:32.923
PURCHASE IS IMPORTANT -- AND

02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:35.058
THEN YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS

02:40:35.125 --> 02:40:36.193
THAT WAS INTERESTING THAT CAUGHT

02:40:36.259 --> 02:40:38.295
MY ATTENTION WAS THE IDEA THAT

02:40:38.362 --> 02:40:39.463
THERE ARE BE PA'S THAT ARE BEING

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:40.964
USED.

02:40:41.031 --> 02:40:42.599
OUR OR OR THAT ARE THAT ARE

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:46.003
EXISTING ON THE THE RECEIPTS --

02:40:46.069 --> 02:40:47.104
I MEAN IF THAT'S THE CASE ON THE

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:48.972
NECESSARY SHOULD ALREADY AREN'T

02:40:49.039 --> 02:40:50.640
LEGAL IN A PROP SIXTY FIVE SO.

02:40:50.707 --> 02:40:53.443
IT BE INTERESTING TO TO KNOW

02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:55.012
WHETHER OR NOT THERE REALLY IS

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:56.279
B. P. A.'S.

02:40:56.346 --> 02:40:57.581
ARE THAT ARE THAT ARE PRESENT

02:40:57.647 --> 02:40:58.648
THERE BECAUSE THOSE ARE

02:40:58.715 --> 02:41:00.150
EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IT BOB

02:41:00.217 --> 02:41:01.184
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE RECOGNIZING

02:41:01.251 --> 02:41:03.987
WE'VE DEALT WITH QUITE A LONG

02:41:04.054 --> 02:41:04.621
TIME AGO AND SO IT WOULD BE GOOD

02:41:04.688 --> 02:41:06.023
NOW -- IF THAT REALLY ACTUALLY

02:41:06.089 --> 02:41:09.192
TRULY IS THE CASE -- AND AND IF

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:09.826
THERE IS A PROJECTS AFFECTED OR

02:41:09.893 --> 02:41:11.995
NOT -- SO.

02:41:12.062 --> 02:41:14.998
YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT -- THIS

02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:16.700
IS SOMETHING THAT WE WE NEED TO

02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:19.002
ADDRESS -- YOU KNOW WE'RE VERY

02:41:19.069 --> 02:41:22.105
RACE -- OF WASTEFUL.

02:41:22.172 --> 02:41:25.475
SPECIES AND IT'S USUALLY WHEN IT

02:41:25.542 --> 02:41:27.444
COMES TO CONVENIENCE AND OTHER

02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:29.112
STUFF LIKE THAT -- IN IT AND

02:41:29.179 --> 02:41:30.480
IT'S NOT SMART FOR US TO

02:41:30.547 --> 02:41:31.748
CONTINUE JUST OVERLOOK SMALL

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:33.216
THINGS LIKE THIS THE THIS IS A

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:35.352
CONVENIENCE FOR US -- THAT YOU

02:41:35.419 --> 02:41:36.887
KNOW WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

02:41:36.953 --> 02:41:38.588
ESTABLISH BUT WE ALSO ARE LIVING

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:39.823
IN THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.725
ADVANCED TIME OF OUR LIVES.

02:41:41.792 --> 02:41:42.325
SO THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:43.927
CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE

02:41:43.994 --> 02:41:45.095
FORWARD I I APPRECIATE THE

02:41:45.162 --> 02:41:47.831
COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS SPECIFYING

02:41:47.898 --> 02:41:50.901
THAT -- YOU KNOW. TO MAKE

02:41:50.967 --> 02:41:52.803
RECEIVED OPTIONAL BEEN TWENTY

02:41:52.869 --> 02:41:53.303
TWENTY TWO AND REQUIRED

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:54.971
BUSINESSES TO OFFER PAPER OR YOU

02:41:55.038 --> 02:41:56.440
RECEIPTS BEGINNING IN.

02:41:56.506 --> 02:41:57.274
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE HELP AND

02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.708
I THINK THAT IN MY OPINION

02:41:58.775 --> 02:41:59.309
THAT'S WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE

02:41:59.376 --> 02:42:00.143
COST.

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:02.612
OF ANY POTENTIAL TURN OVER THAT

02:42:02.679 --> 02:42:03.680
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE WHEN IT COMES

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:04.848
OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE USING

02:42:04.915 --> 02:42:05.816
TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A NEW

02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:06.683
SYSTEM.

02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:08.718
OF PROVIDING ANY RECEIPT -- AND

02:42:08.785 --> 02:42:09.453
THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT THE

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:10.954
LEGISLATURE TENDS TO DO IS

02:42:11.021 --> 02:42:12.022
INFLAMMATION.

02:42:12.089 --> 02:42:13.757
IT TOOK TO REDUCE THE COST IS IS

02:42:13.824 --> 02:42:15.859
IS IS DROUGHT THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:42:15.926 --> 02:42:17.094
TIME OR THE REQUIREMENT.

02:42:17.160 --> 02:42:18.728
OF WHEN YOU HAVE TO WHEN YOU

02:42:18.795 --> 02:42:20.797
HAVE TO FOLLOW -- THIS SPECIFIC

02:42:20.864 --> 02:42:22.466
REGULATION SO I I DON'T THINK

02:42:22.532 --> 02:42:23.433
THAT THIS IS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR

02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:24.835
FORM NOT DOABLE FOR THE BUSINESS

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:25.735
THAT ARE AFFECTED I THINK THIS

02:42:25.802 --> 02:42:26.403
IS JUST.

02:42:26.470 --> 02:42:27.537
SOMETHING NEW AND IT'S A CHANGE

02:42:27.604 --> 02:42:28.705
IN EVERYBODY'S RESISTANT TO

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:29.906
CHANGE ESPECIALLY BUSINESS WHEN

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:31.374
SOMETHING'S BEEN WORKING AND I

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:32.442
UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT I

02:42:32.509 --> 02:42:33.610
UNDERSTAND THE SENTIMENT OF

02:42:33.677 --> 02:42:35.378
BEING CONCERNED OUT OF COST BUT

02:42:35.445 --> 02:42:37.781
I THINK THAT -- YOU'VE DONE THAT

02:42:37.848 --> 02:42:39.483
BY PUSHING OUT THE THE TIME

02:42:39.549 --> 02:42:41.218
FRAME I AND I JUST ASK THAT YOU

02:42:41.284 --> 02:42:42.686

02:42:42.752 --> 02:42:44.621
OF THE ISSUES OF PROOF PROOF OF

02:42:44.688 --> 02:42:45.589
PURCHASE SYSTEM MAKE SURE THAT

02:42:45.655 --> 02:42:46.756
WE'RE NOT PUTTING BUSINESSES IN

02:42:46.823 --> 02:42:47.958
ANY POSITION WHERE THEY'RE GOING

02:42:48.024 --> 02:42:48.992
TO HAVE TO HIRE SOMEBODY TO

02:42:49.059 --> 02:42:49.226
STAND.

02:42:49.292 --> 02:42:50.760
AT THE DOOR -- TO PROVE THAT

02:42:50.827 --> 02:42:52.295

SHOWING ME YOUR PHONE OR

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:54.297
SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THAT I MEAN

02:42:54.364 --> 02:42:55.298
THERE COULD BE OTHER POTENTIAL

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:56.366

BE MY CONCERN BUT I THINK THAT

02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.839

PLANET BY REDUCING OUR OUR WAYS

CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES I

02:43:34.371 --> 02:43:35.539
WALK INTO A STORE AND I DON'T

02:43:35.605 --> 02:43:36.640
WANT TO RECEIPTS AND THEY

02:43:36.706 --> 02:43:37.807
PRINTED AND HAND IT TO ME AND

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:39.643
THAT FEELS LIKE TRUE WASTE AND I

02:43:39.709 --> 02:43:40.110
WISH THEY WOULD JUST.

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:40.844

THEY PRINT IT SAID PHASE ONE

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.815
FEELS LIKE ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT

02:43:45.882 --> 02:43:47.784
POLICY CALL AND AS A MOTHER I

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:49.052
ACTUALLY NEVER LET MY KIDS

02:43:49.119 --> 02:43:50.554
HANDLE RECEIPTS BECAUSE I KNEW

02:43:50.620 --> 02:43:52.055
ABOUT B. P. A. B. PS AND

02:43:52.122 --> 02:43:53.423
ESPECIALLY ON THE ONLY.

02:43:53.490 --> 02:43:54.925
ONE IN CHILDREN I KNOW WELL MY

02:43:54.991 --> 02:43:56.560
BACKGROUND -- BUT ESPECIALLY IN

02:43:56.626 --> 02:43:58.295
CHILDREN THAT REALLY HAS AN

02:43:58.361 --> 02:43:59.596
IMPACT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THEIR

02:43:59.663 --> 02:44:00.730
BODIES AND SO THIS IS.

02:44:00.797 --> 02:44:02.032
AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE SHOULD

02:44:02.098 --> 02:44:03.200
BE TAKING SERIOUSLY BOTH FROM

02:44:03.266 --> 02:44:04.034
ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE BUT

02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:05.669
ALSO THE TOXICITY OF THE

02:44:05.735 --> 02:44:09.539
RECEIPTS IS REAL -- BUT I AM

02:44:09.606 --> 02:44:11.341
CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT ON

02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:12.842
SMALL BUSINESSES AND YOU AND I

02:44:12.909 --> 02:44:14.311
HAVE HAD THIS CONVERSATION --

02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:15.879
AND I'M CONCERNED WHEN I THINK

02:44:15.946 --> 02:44:17.447
ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS IS A

02:44:17.514 --> 02:44:19.783
THRESHOLD YOU KNOW I DO AGREE

02:44:19.849 --> 02:44:20.984
THAT I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY

02:44:21.051 --> 02:44:22.352
LOCAL RESTAURANTS THAT ARE

02:44:22.419 --> 02:44:23.820
PRICEY IN THE BAY AREA THAT

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:25.522
REACH A MILLION DOLLARS.

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:27.090
A MOM AND POP RESTAURANT A LOCAL

02:44:27.157 --> 02:44:28.358
JEWELRY STORE YOU KNOW YOU CAN

02:44:28.425 --> 02:44:29.759
THINK OF A LOT OF EXAMPLES.

02:44:29.826 --> 02:44:31.261
AND SO I DON'T WANT THE

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:32.662
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TO BE SO

02:44:32.729 --> 02:44:33.964
COSTLY THAT WERE HURTING OUR

02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:35.365
LOCAL BUSINESSES AND SO I WOULD

02:44:35.432 --> 02:44:36.766
ACTUALLY INVITE THE OPPOSITION

02:44:36.833 --> 02:44:38.835
AS WELL -- YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:39.903

FOR THE FOLKS CONCERNED IN MY

02:44:45.942 --> 02:44:47.310
DISTRICT ARE DRESSED.

THANK YOU.

02:45:32.222 --> 02:45:33.356
I MISS SMITH HAD.

02:45:33.423 --> 02:45:35.158
I AM I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE

02:45:35.225 --> 02:45:36.593
INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL I I

02:45:36.660 --> 02:45:38.662
THINK YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENTALLY

02:45:38.728 --> 02:45:40.830
IT MAKES SENSE ON TO BE REDUCING

02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:42.332
WASTE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:44.734
I HAVE TWO CONCERNS PRIMARILY

02:45:44.801 --> 02:45:46.069
ONE I THINK THAT THERE

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:48.038
REGULATION OR THE THE DANGER OF

02:45:48.104 --> 02:45:49.773
THIS SMALL CHEMICALS IS THIS

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:50.840
SHOULD BE A SEPARATE.

02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:52.442
ISSUE AND AND HANDLE REGULAR

02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:54.010
REGULATORY LEE SEPARATELY.

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:55.478
BUT ONE THING THAT I JUST I

02:45:55.545 --> 02:45:57.981
CANNOT GET AWAY FROM -- FROM MY

02:45:58.048 --> 02:45:59.382
CAMPAIGN AND AND NOW TO MY

02:45:59.449 --> 02:45:59.816
SERVICE HERE IN THE

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:01.451
LEGISLATURE'S HEARING TIME AND

02:46:01.518 --> 02:46:02.986
TIME AGAIN FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL

02:46:03.053 --> 02:46:04.354
SIZES NOT JUST SMALL BUSINESSES

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:05.755
BUT ANYBODY EVEN A MIDSIZE

02:46:05.822 --> 02:46:06.923
BUSINESS EVEN SOMEBODY WITH

02:46:06.990 --> 02:46:07.524
GROSS RECEIPTS OVER A MILLION

02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:08.591
DOLLARS.

02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:10.126
THAT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS

02:46:10.193 --> 02:46:12.162
IN CALIFORNIA IS GETTING TOO

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:14.331
HIGH AND NOT UNLIKE A LOT OF

02:46:14.397 --> 02:46:16.199
WELL INTENTIONED TAX MEASURES

02:46:16.266 --> 02:46:17.167
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF OUR OUR

02:46:17.233 --> 02:46:18.435
ASSEMBLY THIS YEAR.

02:46:18.501 --> 02:46:20.603
THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH IN

02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:22.539
PUSHING THESE COSTS ON TO

02:46:22.605 --> 02:46:23.940
BUSINESS IS BECOMING.

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:25.709
PROHIBITIVE I MEAN I APPRECIATE

02:46:25.775 --> 02:46:26.776
THAT IT'S EVEN A COUPLE OF YEARS

02:46:26.843 --> 02:46:27.911
OUT BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S A

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:28.978
COUPLE OF YEARS OUT MEANS THAT'S

02:46:29.045 --> 02:46:30.313
A FEW MORE YEARS OF COMPLIANCE

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:31.481
WITH INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:32.282

THAT'S INCREASE IN WORKERS COMP

02:46:33.883 --> 02:46:35.819

PREMIUMS.

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:40.490

02:48:06.242 --> 02:48:08.178
LOSS OF A PROBLEM THERE I'M

QUITE OFTEN AND MAYBE I'M THE

02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:24.921
EXCEPTION BUT QUITE OFTEN WHEN I

02:49:24.988 --> 02:49:25.788

02:49:26.956 --> 02:49:28.224
I GO LOOKING FOR IT AND I CAN

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:29.826

EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT APPS MOST

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:45.341

02:49:56.085 --> 02:49:57.153
BETTER BETTER BETTER PERSONAL

OPPOSITION IS NOT THE CONSUMER

02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:56.118
PROTECTION ISSUE.

02:59:56.185 --> 02:59:58.187
IT'S IT'S THE TECHNICALITY ON

02:59:58.254 --> 03:00:00.022
HOW DISCLOSURES AND CONSENT NEED

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:02.158

THIS BILL FOCUSES ON A UNIQUE

03:09:08.336 --> 03:09:09.638
IF THE DONATION IS NOT

03:09:09.705 --> 03:09:12.941
RESTRICTED THAN THE BILL DOES

03:09:13.008 --> 03:09:14.109
NOT APPLY.

03:16:58.306 --> 03:16:59.741
SAY.

03:16:59.807 --> 03:17:03.778
HOW ARE WE GOING TO DEVIATE FROM

AND THAT IS TO USE OTHER FORMS

03:17:32.807 --> 03:17:35.510
OF DISCLOSURE. TO ENSURE THAT

03:17:35.577 --> 03:17:41.115
THE POTENTIAL DONORS UNDERSTAND.

03:17:41.182 --> 03:17:43.651
THE VALUATION PROCESS.

03:17:43.718 --> 03:17:48.122
BUT TO INSTEAD CHANGE GENERALLY

03:17:48.189 --> 03:17:49.657
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

03:17:49.724 --> 03:17:52.760

03:17:52.827 --> 03:17:54.929
OF THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION.

03:17:54.996 --> 03:17:56.965

03:17:57.031 --> 03:17:58.299

THAT WE BELIEVE.

03:18:00.168 --> 03:18:03.504

03:18:03.571 --> 03:18:05.974
WHICH WE CAN NEVER AGREE WITH.

03:18:06.040 --> 03:18:08.042

OPPOSITION -- I THINK THE AUTHOR

03:20:11.666 --> 03:20:13.101
IS RAISED A VERY.

03:20:13.167 --> 03:20:16.003
A REAL AND TANGIBLE PROBLEM WITH

03:20:16.070 --> 03:20:17.538
THAT WERE EXPERIENCING WITH

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:20.942

ABOUT -- GAP PRINCIPLES HOW

03:20:26.447 --> 03:20:28.216
WOULD YOU SOLVE THE PROBLEM THEM

03:20:28.282 --> 03:20:29.784

03:20:33.087 --> 03:20:33.421
THROUGH THE CHAIR.

03:20:33.488 --> 03:20:37.024
THE THE ISSUE IS HOW DO YOU

03:20:37.091 --> 03:20:38.493
REFLECT.

03:20:38.559 --> 03:20:40.695
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

03:20:40.762 --> 03:20:42.196
THE VALUE THAT MAY OCCUR UNDER

03:20:42.263 --> 03:20:42.797
GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

03:20:42.864 --> 03:20:45.733
PRINCIPLES AND AS THEY POINT OUT

03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:48.636
WHAT THAT PRODUCT MAY BE WORTH.

03:20:48.703 --> 03:20:49.937
WHEN IT'S DISTRIBUTED?

03:20:50.004 --> 03:20:51.172
IN SOME OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD

03:20:51.239 --> 03:20:52.907
WE HAVE OFFERED SPECIFIC

03:20:52.974 --> 03:20:56.844
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE USED TO

03:20:56.911 --> 03:21:00.348
DISCLOSE THAT WITHOUT DEVIATING

03:21:00.415 --> 03:21:02.216
FROM GAP.

03:21:02.283 --> 03:21:02.984
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:05.653
HAS MANY TOOLS AVAILABLE AND CAN

03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:08.790
WORK WITH US TO ENSURE THAT THE

03:21:08.856 --> 03:21:10.758
CITY TO IS ANOTHER FORMS ARE

03:21:10.825 --> 03:21:11.926
FILED WITH THE AG.

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:14.162
AND THE STATE TAX RETURN DOES

03:21:14.228 --> 03:21:15.797
ACCURATELY REFLECT THAT.

03:21:15.863 --> 03:21:17.532
WITHOUT SAYING BUT DON'T APPLY

03:21:17.598 --> 03:21:19.467
GAP AND THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR

03:21:19.534 --> 03:21:19.934
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM.

03:21:20.001 --> 03:21:22.170
SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO DISCUSS

03:21:22.236 --> 03:21:23.337
WITH THEM WAYS.

03:21:23.404 --> 03:21:25.406
TO GIVE DONORS AND UNDERSTANDING

03:21:25.473 --> 03:21:27.875
OF THAT DIFFERENTIAL BUT IT

03:21:27.942 --> 03:21:30.244
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CHANGING.

03:21:30.311 --> 03:21:31.179
ALRIGHT SO THROUGH THE CHAIR OF

03:21:31.245 --> 03:21:31.779
THE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

03:21:31.846 --> 03:21:36.651
OFFICE WHAT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH

03:21:36.717 --> 03:21:39.987
THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED.

03:21:40.054 --> 03:21:41.322
I CAN JUST SAY FRESNO WE ARE

03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:42.056
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH

03:21:42.123 --> 03:21:43.558
OPPOSITION AND TRYING TO FIGURE

03:21:43.624 --> 03:21:45.259
THIS OUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE THE

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:47.094
FAX ME A LETTER UNTIL MONDAY

03:21:47.161 --> 03:21:47.829
YESTERDAY AT BELIEVE.

03:21:47.895 --> 03:21:48.930
PREVIOUS TO THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:21:48.996 --> 03:21:51.699
WORKING WITH THE CAL CP GAMES.

03:21:51.766 --> 03:21:53.267
ON WHAT I THINK ARE SIMILAR SORT

03:21:53.334 --> 03:21:57.305
OF OVERLAPPING CONCERNS BUT NOT --

03:21:57.371 --> 03:21:59.173
NOT ENOUGH TIME.

03:21:59.240 --> 03:22:00.741
TO GET TO THOSE SO I HOPE THAT

03:22:00.808 --> 03:22:02.310
WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING

03:22:02.376 --> 03:22:04.111
THIS FOR WITH THAT PASSED THE

03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:05.513
LETTER WAS THIS MAY KNOWN TO US

03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:07.782
YESTERDAY -- AND THAT BEING SAID

03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:08.349
I MEAN WE HAD TO HAVE SOME

03:22:08.416 --> 03:22:09.150
SPECIFIC.

03:22:09.217 --> 03:22:10.651
RESPONSES ABOUT THAT I WOULD SAY

03:22:10.718 --> 03:22:12.353
THAT.

03:22:12.420 --> 03:22:14.489
NO WE ARE INTERESTED IN.

03:22:14.555 --> 03:22:16.324
PRECLUDING THIS UNDERLYING

03:22:16.390 --> 03:22:17.925
REPORTING PROBLEM IN THE FIRST

03:22:17.992 --> 03:22:19.760
PLACE INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT TO

03:22:19.827 --> 03:22:21.395
HAPPEN AND THEN PUT AN ASTERISK

03:22:21.462 --> 03:22:23.030
ON IT HEY YOU SEE THE LITTLE

03:22:23.097 --> 03:22:25.233
DISCLAIMER -- DISCLOSURE ABOUT

03:22:25.299 --> 03:22:27.068
IT SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN

03:22:27.134 --> 03:22:29.136
TRY TO WORK THIS OUT.

03:22:29.203 --> 03:22:29.737
WE'RE CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO

03:22:29.804 --> 03:22:33.174
DOING THAT -- AND I'LL MAIL IT

03:22:33.241 --> 03:22:34.909
TIENEN RESPOND MORE SPECIFICALLY

03:22:34.976 --> 03:22:37.178
BUT AGAIN WE HAVE A LOT OF

03:22:37.245 --> 03:22:38.479
DISCUSSION THAT HAS TO OCCUR.

03:22:38.546 --> 03:22:40.081
YOU KNOW AS THE BILL MOVES

03:22:40.147 --> 03:22:41.649
FORWARD ON THIS PART I WILL MISS

03:22:41.716 --> 03:22:42.316
THE MORE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED A

03:22:42.383 --> 03:22:44.886
VERY A REAL ISSUE.

03:22:44.952 --> 03:22:45.953
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THESE

03:22:46.020 --> 03:22:47.288
CHARITIES OUGHT TO BE VALUE IN

03:22:47.355 --> 03:22:48.489
THIS VERY SPECIFIC CLASS OF

03:22:48.556 --> 03:22:50.191
ASSET THE WAY THAT THEY ARE --

03:22:50.258 --> 03:22:51.492
BUT I DO THINK THE OPPOSITION

03:22:51.559 --> 03:22:52.793
ALSO HAS A POINT THAT WE

03:22:52.860 --> 03:22:54.195
SHOULDN'T DEVIATE FROM GENERALLY

03:22:54.262 --> 03:22:55.463
ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

03:22:55.530 --> 03:22:56.631
BECAUSE THAT.

03:22:56.697 --> 03:22:57.698
PUTS US IN A SEPARATE CATEGORY

03:22:57.765 --> 03:22:58.900
THAN  ENTIRE

03:22:58.966 --> 03:22:59.734
COUNTRY WHICH IS VERY

03:22:59.800 --> 03:23:01.335
PROBLEMATIC SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT

03:23:01.402 --> 03:23:02.169
THE BILL TODAY I'D LIKE TO

03:23:02.236 --> 03:23:03.871
ENCOURAGE YOU. TO TRY AND WORK

03:23:03.938 --> 03:23:05.606
OUT SOME LANGUAGE THAT STILL

03:23:05.673 --> 03:23:07.875
COMPLIES WITH GAP -- IN THE END

03:23:07.942 --> 03:23:08.676
AT THE SAME TIME SOLVE YOUR

03:23:08.743 --> 03:23:12.480
PROBLEM BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

03:23:12.547 --> 03:23:14.248
THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND HERE.

03:23:14.315 --> 03:23:15.483
WE HOPE THAT THERE IS A MIDDLE

03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:16.017
GROUND WE'VE IDENTIFIED.

03:23:16.083 --> 03:23:17.451
THE ISSUE AT YOU KNOW I I WORK A

03:23:17.518 --> 03:23:18.452
LOT WITH NON PROFITS AND MY TAKE

03:23:18.519 --> 03:23:19.987
ON THIS IS.

03:23:20.054 --> 03:23:21.856
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AN ISSUE WITH

03:23:21.923 --> 03:23:23.391
REPORTING FOR CHARITIES AND WE

03:23:23.457 --> 03:23:25.192
JUST DON'T WANT THAT TO BE AN

03:23:25.259 --> 03:23:26.460
ISSUE FOR THE NON PROFITS AND WE

03:23:26.527 --> 03:23:28.696
THAT THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO HAVE.

03:23:28.763 --> 03:23:30.698
SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S

03:23:30.765 --> 03:23:32.833
REPORTABLE AND HOW IT'S

03:23:32.900 --> 03:23:34.502
REPORTABLE AND JUST FOR THOSE

03:23:34.569 --> 03:23:35.736
THAT DON'T FOLLOW IT'S AS REAL

03:23:35.803 --> 03:23:37.805
SMALL SLIVER -- OF WHAT WE'RE

03:23:37.872 --> 03:23:39.307
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF

03:23:39.373 --> 03:23:41.275
DONATIONS -- THIS IS NOT ALL

03:23:41.342 --> 03:23:44.011
DONATIONS THIS IS HAS TO BE DONE --

03:23:44.078 --> 03:23:45.446
SPECIFIC -- SO I I WANT TO MAKE

03:23:45.513 --> 03:23:46.581
THAT CLEAR THIS IS A SMALL

03:23:46.647 --> 03:23:48.683
PROBLEM ON A SMALL SLIVER BUT

03:23:48.749 --> 03:23:50.217
BIG ENOUGH PROBLEM FOR US TO SAY

03:23:50.284 --> 03:23:53.054
WE DON'T WANT NONPROFITS TO HAVE.

03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:54.288
TO DEAL WITH IT YOU KNOW

03:23:54.355 --> 03:23:56.223
ATTORNEY GENERAL AND COMPLIANCE

03:23:56.290 --> 03:23:57.258
ISSUES AND SO THAT'S IMPORTANT

03:23:57.325 --> 03:23:57.858
FOR US AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

03:23:57.925 --> 03:23:59.427
COMING FROM AND CERTAINLY WE

03:23:59.493 --> 03:24:02.563
WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

03:24:02.630 --> 03:24:03.664
WITH OPPOSITION.

03:24:03.731 --> 03:24:04.298
THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE TWO

03:24:04.365 --> 03:24:04.932
QUESTIONS ALSO BUT I THINK THE

03:24:04.999 --> 03:24:06.267
FIRST QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED

03:24:06.334 --> 03:24:08.302
PARTIALLY BY BY THE OPPOSITION.

03:24:08.369 --> 03:24:09.804
AND THE ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS

03:24:09.870 --> 03:24:12.139
WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY -- WAS

03:24:12.206 --> 03:24:13.474
REALLY DOT BURDENSOME TO LET'S

03:24:13.541 --> 03:24:15.610
SAY GO FROM GAP TOO FAST BE FOR

03:24:15.676 --> 03:24:18.512
EXAMPLE AND YOU KNOW --

03:24:18.579 --> 03:24:21.315
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW

03:24:21.382 --> 03:24:23.784
SUBJECTING MYSELF TO TWO

03:24:23.851 --> 03:24:25.086
DIFFERENT REGULATORY ACCOUNTING.

03:24:25.152 --> 03:24:26.787
METHODS WOULD BE PUT IN SOME I

03:24:26.854 --> 03:24:28.789
MEAN NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND THE

03:24:28.856 --> 03:24:30.858
QUESTION ORIGINALLY WAS WHETHER

03:24:30.925 --> 03:24:32.193
OR NOT IT'S DOABLE.

03:24:32.259 --> 03:24:33.527
YOU KNOW FOR YOU KNOW FOR FOR

03:24:33.594 --> 03:24:35.696
YOU FOLKS TO BASICALLY GO FROM

03:24:35.763 --> 03:24:37.665
ONE SYSTEM TO ANOTHER FROM YOUR

03:24:37.732 --> 03:24:38.966
CAP TOO FAST BE.

03:24:39.033 --> 03:24:40.434
SUE BUT IF THERE'S A MIDDLE

03:24:40.501 --> 03:24:41.102
GROUND THAT WOULD BE -- YOU KNOW

03:24:41.168 --> 03:24:42.436
ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH PARTIES I

03:24:42.503 --> 03:24:43.604
THINK YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE THE

03:24:43.671 --> 03:24:45.439
SOLUTION BUT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE

03:24:45.506 --> 03:24:47.008
THAT -- WE DO HAVE A REAL

03:24:47.074 --> 03:24:47.975
PROBLEM AND YOU HAVE JUST DONE

03:24:48.042 --> 03:24:49.176
HEARING FROM FROM THE AG'S

03:24:49.243 --> 03:24:51.579
OFFICE OF OF ALL THE EXAMPLES

03:24:51.646 --> 03:24:52.747
THAT WE WILL BE CITED I THINK

03:24:52.813 --> 03:24:53.447
YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A REAL

03:24:53.514 --> 03:24:54.348
PROBLEM.

03:24:54.415 --> 03:24:56.751
AND DOT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR

03:24:56.817 --> 03:24:58.185
THE AG'S OFFICE THEY'LL.

03:24:58.252 --> 03:24:59.720
KNOW THE BILL BASICALLY REQUIRES

03:24:59.787 --> 03:25:01.822
THE VALUATION TO TAKE PLACE AT

03:25:01.889 --> 03:25:04.158
THE DESTINATION OF THE LET'S SAY

03:25:04.225 --> 03:25:06.961
THE DONATION -- N. OR AT THE

03:25:07.028 --> 03:25:11.999
TIME OF THE RECEIPT SO THE

03:25:12.066 --> 03:25:13.668
QUESTION IS IF.

03:25:13.734 --> 03:25:14.201
IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN

03:25:14.268 --> 03:25:15.102
WOULDN'T YOU ALSO BE CREATING

03:25:15.169 --> 03:25:16.303
SOME SOMEWHAT OF A VARIATION.

03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:18.773
IN THE VALUATION PROCESS ITSELF

03:25:18.839 --> 03:25:20.441
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE VALUATION --

03:25:20.508 --> 03:25:23.044
COULD FLUCTUATE FROM ONE COUNTRY

03:25:23.110 --> 03:25:24.645
TO ANOTHER SO YOU DON'T HAVE ANY

03:25:24.712 --> 03:25:26.847
CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT --

03:25:26.914 --> 03:25:28.816
THROUGHOUT THAT PROCESS SO SOME

03:25:28.883 --> 03:25:30.651
WONDERING IF THAT'S AN ISSUE BUT

03:25:30.718 --> 03:25:32.186
I THINK COMPARED.

03:25:32.253 --> 03:25:33.587
TO COMPARED TO THE CURRENT

03:25:33.654 --> 03:25:34.755
SYSTEM I THINK IS STILL BETTER

03:25:34.822 --> 03:25:36.490
BUT YET I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS

03:25:36.557 --> 03:25:37.792
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S AN

03:25:37.858 --> 03:25:38.492
ISSUE.

03:25:38.559 --> 03:25:40.194
ARE YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO TO

03:25:40.261 --> 03:25:42.997
THE VALUATION OF THE DONATION

03:25:43.064 --> 03:25:45.032
ITSELF WELL WHITE SOME CHARITIES

03:25:45.099 --> 03:25:46.400
I MEAN THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE

03:25:46.467 --> 03:25:48.469
CHARITIES THAT ACCEPT RESTRICTED

03:25:48.536 --> 03:25:50.204
DONATIONS IT CANNOT BE USED IN

03:25:50.271 --> 03:25:51.639
THE UNITED STATES TO DO SOME

03:25:51.706 --> 03:25:53.708
ADDITIONAL HOMEWORK. TO EVALUATE

03:25:53.774 --> 03:25:55.476
THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

03:25:55.543 --> 03:25:58.612
GIFT -- THEY'RE ALREADY DOING

03:25:58.679 --> 03:25:59.280
THIS.

03:25:59.346 --> 03:26:00.581
WITH THEIR ACCOUNTANTS WHEN

03:26:00.648 --> 03:26:03.984
THEY'RE FILING THE IRS -- FORM --

03:26:04.051 --> 03:26:05.152
NINE NINETY THE ACCOUNTS AND THE

03:26:05.219 --> 03:26:06.353
CHARITIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

03:26:06.420 --> 03:26:08.889
WHAT ASSETS ARE RESTRICTED WHAT

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:10.791
ARE TEMPORARY RESTRICTED AND

03:26:10.858 --> 03:26:12.893
WATER PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED SO

03:26:12.960 --> 03:26:14.762
THIS HOME WORK CAN BE DONE ALSO

03:26:14.829 --> 03:26:16.497
DONATIONS THAT ARE NOT APPROVED

03:26:16.564 --> 03:26:17.698
BY THE FDA.

03:26:17.765 --> 03:26:19.366
THEY CAN'T USE US PRICES FOR

03:26:19.433 --> 03:26:21.135
THOSE DONATIONS SO THEY'VE HAD

03:26:21.202 --> 03:26:22.636
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE FAIR

03:26:22.703 --> 03:26:24.505
MARKET VALUE THE WAY THINGS

03:26:24.572 --> 03:26:26.941
STAND RIGHT NOW WITH FAST BE.

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:29.343
IS THAT THEY GET TO USE THE BEST.

03:26:29.410 --> 03:26:32.213
PRICE THE BEST PRICE.

03:26:32.279 --> 03:26:34.215
OF AVAILABLE FOR THE DRUG AND

03:26:34.281 --> 03:26:37.017
THEY GET TO USE US PRICES EVEN

03:26:37.084 --> 03:26:38.085
THOUGH THEY KNOW AT THE TIME

03:26:38.152 --> 03:26:39.453
THEY GET THE DONATION OR SHORTLY

03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:41.155
THERE AFTER THAT IT'S GONNA GO

03:26:41.222 --> 03:26:42.923
TO KENYA.

03:26:42.990 --> 03:26:44.458
AND SO THIS IS RESULTED IN

03:26:44.525 --> 03:26:47.394
UNBELIEVABLY RIDICULOUS RESULTS

03:26:47.461 --> 03:26:49.396
WERE CHARITIES ARE BASICALLY

03:26:49.463 --> 03:26:51.298
INCREASING THE PRICES OF

03:26:51.365 --> 03:26:57.071
DONATIONS. 81000%.

03:26:57.138 --> 03:26:58.205
I MEAN THAT'S JUST ABSURD AND IF

03:26:58.272 --> 03:26:59.240
THIS WAS A MUTUAL FUND.

03:26:59.306 --> 03:27:02.042
YOU WOULD GO CRAZY RIGHT IF IF

03:27:02.109 --> 03:27:04.211
YOUR MUTUAL FUND ADVISORS COULD

03:27:04.278 --> 03:27:05.646
INCREASE.

03:27:05.713 --> 03:27:08.115
THE VALUE OF THEIR FUNDS AND YET

03:27:08.182 --> 03:27:09.917
CHARITIES ARE DOING THIS TIME

03:27:09.984 --> 03:27:11.986
AFTER TIME BECAUSE FAST BE HAS

03:27:12.052 --> 03:27:14.155
NOT ACTED AND FAST BE THUS FAR

03:27:14.221 --> 03:27:15.856
DOES NOT CONSIDER DONOR

03:27:15.923 --> 03:27:17.124
RESTRICTIONS.

03:27:17.191 --> 03:27:19.059
AND SO CAN IT BE DONE YES IT CAN

03:27:19.126 --> 03:27:21.629
BE DONE WILL IT REQUIRE WORK YES

03:27:21.695 --> 03:27:23.164
IT WILL BE RE REQUIRE WORK BUT

03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:24.298
IT CAN BE DONE.

03:27:24.365 --> 03:27:25.933
AND IT WILL PROMOTE A LEVEL

03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:27.601
PLAYING FIELD FOR CHARITIES THAT

03:27:27.668 --> 03:27:29.603
ARE PUT ACCEPTING PREDOMINATELY

03:27:29.670 --> 03:27:31.172
CASH DONATIONS.

03:27:31.238 --> 03:27:33.474
THESE CHARITIES CAN'T COMPETE

03:27:33.541 --> 03:27:35.242
WITH DONATIONS LIKE SOME OF

03:27:35.309 --> 03:27:36.043

PHARMACEUTICALS THERE'S NO

03:27:39.480 --> 03:27:41.615
COMPETITION.

A NAVAL VETERAN MYSELF.

03:32:31.805 --> 03:32:33.373
I WAS GOING TO TAKE THE TROLLEY

03:32:33.440 --> 03:32:34.575
TO THE BASE.

03:32:34.641 --> 03:32:36.343
WHEN I LEARNED THAT?

03:32:36.410 --> 03:32:37.578
IT WAS QUITE A WALK TO THE

03:32:37.644 --> 03:32:38.946
TROLLEY LINE.

03:32:39.012 --> 03:32:41.482
I DECIDE TO GRAB MY HELMET AND

03:32:41.548 --> 03:32:44.985
SET UP TO RENT A BIRD SCOOTER.

03:32:45.052 --> 03:32:47.221
TO GET TO THE TROLLEY STATION.

03:32:47.287 --> 03:32:48.755
I RENTED TO BIRD SCOOTERS THE

03:32:48.822 --> 03:32:50.657
PREVIOUS DAY.

03:32:50.724 --> 03:32:52.392
WAS SO I WAS FAMILIAR WITH.

03:32:52.459 --> 03:32:56.830
THEIR OPERATION.

03:32:56.897 --> 03:32:59.900
WHILE ON THE SCOOTER.

03:32:59.967 --> 03:33:03.370
I BEGAN TO DESCEND THE HILL.

03:33:03.437 --> 03:33:04.738
WHICH BECAME A LITTLE STEEP.

03:33:04.805 --> 03:33:06.473
WHAT I APPLIED THE BRAKES?

03:33:06.540 --> 03:33:08.008
THEY DIDN'T WORK.

03:33:08.075 --> 03:33:10.177
THE BRAKES FAILED.

03:33:10.244 --> 03:33:11.812
IMMEDIATELY I ASK MYSELF WHAT

03:33:11.879 --> 03:33:14.181
SHOULD I DO. ONE THING THAT CAME

03:33:14.248 --> 03:33:15.616
TO MIND WAS DRIVING.

03:33:15.682 --> 03:33:17.518
OR RIDING OVER SOMEONE'S

03:33:17.584 --> 03:33:19.253
DRIVEWAY AND HOPE I CAN GO OVER

03:33:19.319 --> 03:33:20.387
THE RETAINING WALL.

03:33:20.454 --> 03:33:21.555
THEN I LOOKED DOWN AT THE BOTTOM

03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:23.524
OF THE HILL AND I SAW THAT THE

03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:24.391
ROAD COMING IN FROM THE RIGHT

03:33:24.458 --> 03:33:24.725
WAS.

03:33:24.791 --> 03:33:25.993
IN THE SENDING ONE SO I THOUGHT

03:33:26.059 --> 03:33:27.060
MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT TO THE

03:33:27.127 --> 03:33:29.329
BOTTOM AND AND CLIMB UP THAT

03:33:29.396 --> 03:33:32.132
HILL TO SLOW DOWN.

03:33:32.199 --> 03:33:32.766
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING AFTER

03:33:32.833 --> 03:33:33.634
THAT.

03:33:33.700 --> 03:33:36.737
I BLACKED OUT AND I ENDED UP IN

03:33:36.803 --> 03:33:38.205
THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT.

03:33:38.272 --> 03:33:40.107

03:33:49.716 --> 03:33:53.153
IN MY BIRTHDATE.

03:33:53.220 --> 03:33:54.688
HE THEN INFORMED ME THAT THE

03:33:54.755 --> 03:33:57.324
TEAM WANTED TO TAKE ME TO THE

03:33:57.391 --> 03:34:03.330
ARE -- THE CLEAN UP MY WOUNDS HE

03:34:03.397 --> 03:34:04.898

AGREE TO DONATE MY ORGANS -- IF

03:34:09.770 --> 03:34:11.572
I CAN COME OUT OF IT.

03:34:11.638 --> 03:34:12.339
OKAY.

03:34:12.406 --> 03:34:17.878
SO ANOTHER STRESSFUL MOMENT IN

03:34:17.945 --> 03:34:19.713
AFTER THE EMERGENCY THE

03:34:19.780 --> 03:34:23.884
AMBULANCE IT HAD GOT ME THERE --

03:34:23.951 --> 03:34:25.319
DUE TO THE BRAKE FAILURE I

03:34:25.385 --> 03:34:27.421
SUFFERED A CONCUSSION.

03:34:27.487 --> 03:34:29.890
RATHER SERIOUS ONE EVEN THOUGH I

03:34:29.957 --> 03:34:33.760
HAD MY HELMET ON AND FASTENED.

03:34:33.827 --> 03:34:36.663
SOME POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS.

03:34:36.730 --> 03:34:38.632
ROAD RASH BURNS ON THE BACKS OF

03:34:38.699 --> 03:34:40.467
MY HANDS ON MY KNEES AND MY

03:34:40.534 --> 03:34:42.069
ELBOWS.

03:34:42.135 --> 03:34:43.470
EXPOSED TEN TENDONS IN MY LEFT

03:34:43.537 --> 03:34:45.239

03:34:49.343 --> 03:34:50.510

I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR TWO

03:34:52.145 --> 03:34:54.014
AND A HALF DAYS AND STILL HAVE

03:34:54.081 --> 03:34:56.283
SOME RECURRING PAIN.

03:34:56.350 --> 03:34:58.919
MOSTLY IN THE FORM OF HEADACHES

03:34:58.986 --> 03:35:02.522
AND COGNITIVE ISSUES

03:35:02.589 --> 03:35:02.823
[inaudible]

03:35:02.889 --> 03:35:04.224
THESE SCOOTERS.

03:35:04.291 --> 03:35:06.193
MAY PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE

03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:08.095
TRANSPORTATION OPTION.

03:35:08.161 --> 03:35:09.396
BUT THEY NEED TO BE WELL

03:35:09.463 --> 03:35:11.231
MAINTAINED.

03:35:11.298 --> 03:35:14.534
SO THAT RIDERS CAN BE SAFE

03:35:14.601 --> 03:35:14.835
[inaudible]

03:35:14.901 --> 03:35:16.270
IMAGINE.

03:35:16.336 --> 03:35:18.572

THAT THE BRAKES WEREN'T WORKING.

03:35:22.709 --> 03:35:24.911
SO YOU PLOW INTO A CAR IN FRONT

03:35:24.978 --> 03:35:26.546
OF YOU OR TAKE A ONLY CHILD

03:35:26.613 --> 03:35:30.017

03:35:30.083 --> 03:35:31.918

AND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

03:35:59.980 --> 03:36:02.783
VERY IMPORTANT -- NEW TECHNOLOGY

03:36:02.849 --> 03:36:06.019
TO BE EXAMINED WITHIN THIS

03:36:06.086 --> 03:36:06.520
COMMITTEE AND WITHIN THE

03:36:06.586 --> 03:36:07.187
LEGISLATURE.

03:36:07.254 --> 03:36:08.188
THIS HARKENS BACK A LITTLE BIT

03:36:08.255 --> 03:36:09.589
TO UBER AND LEFT WHEN THEY

03:36:09.656 --> 03:36:11.258
SUDDENLY.

03:36:11.325 --> 03:36:13.460
CLUSTER BOMB THE CITIES AND THEN

03:36:13.527 --> 03:36:14.928
WE WERE LEFT TO TRY TO REGULATE

03:36:14.995 --> 03:36:18.332
AND PROTECT CONSUMERS AFTERWARDS.

03:36:18.398 --> 03:36:21.168
THE EAST GOODERS ARE EVERYWHERE.

03:36:21.234 --> 03:36:22.936
AND CURRENTLY THEY HAVE NO

03:36:23.003 --> 03:36:25.839
INSURANCE THAT IS ON THEM SHOULD

03:36:25.906 --> 03:36:27.040
SOMEONE USING THE EAST GIRDER

03:36:27.107 --> 03:36:30.877
SCOOTER RUN INTO A BLIND PERSON.

03:36:30.944 --> 03:36:32.879
AUSTRIAN -- SOMEHOW INVOLVE

03:36:32.946 --> 03:36:34.281
THEMSELVES IN AN ACCIDENT WHERE

03:36:34.348 --> 03:36:35.649
SOMEONE IS HARMED.

03:36:35.716 --> 03:36:36.917
ADDITIONALLY THERE IS NO

03:36:36.983 --> 03:36:38.819
PROTECTION FOR PERSONS LIKE THE

03:36:38.885 --> 03:36:40.520
WITNESS THAT YOU JUST HEARD.

03:36:40.587 --> 03:36:42.322
SHOULD THEY HAVE A DEFECT IN

03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:44.591
THEM OR SHOULD THEY FAIL TO

03:36:44.658 --> 03:36:46.059
OPERATE APPROPRIATELY.

03:36:46.126 --> 03:36:47.160
IN MANY INSTANCES THEIR

03:36:47.227 --> 03:36:48.595
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM IS PAYING

03:36:48.662 --> 03:36:50.297
SOMEONE ELSE FIVE DOLLARS A

03:36:50.364 --> 03:36:52.065
NIGHT TO PICK THEM UP TAKE THEM

03:36:52.132 --> 03:36:53.467
HOME PLUG THE MAN IN CHARGE THEM.

03:36:53.533 --> 03:36:55.402
SO THERE ISN'T ANY TYPE OF

03:36:55.469 --> 03:36:57.704
MOTIVATION FOR THEM LEGALLY TO

03:36:57.771 --> 03:36:58.805
MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS

03:36:58.872 --> 03:37:01.174
ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND ARE SAFE

03:37:01.241 --> 03:37:02.743
FOR CONSUMERS.

03:37:02.809 --> 03:37:04.077
IN READING THE OPPOSITION I'VE

03:37:04.144 --> 03:37:06.012
SEEN WHERE THEIR CONCERNS RAISED

03:37:06.079 --> 03:37:08.048
ABOUT HOW THIS WILL STIFLE NEW

03:37:08.115 --> 03:37:09.249
TECHNOLOGY WELL THAT'S SOMETHING

03:37:09.316 --> 03:37:10.951
WE HEARD DURING THE UBER AND

03:37:11.017 --> 03:37:12.419
LIFT DISCUSSIONS AS WELL.

03:37:12.486 --> 03:37:13.787
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CITY AND

03:37:13.854 --> 03:37:15.355
COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE

03:37:15.422 --> 03:37:17.190
MOST RIGOROUS PROGRAM WHICH DOES

03:37:17.257 --> 03:37:18.525
REQUIRE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

03:37:18.592 --> 03:37:19.960
WORTH OF INSURANCE ON BEHALF OF

03:37:20.026 --> 03:37:20.961
THE COMPANY.

03:37:21.027 --> 03:37:23.163
IN THEY HAD NUMEROUS APPLICANTS

03:37:23.230 --> 03:37:24.831
TO RECEIVE TWO SLOTS THAT WERE

03:37:24.898 --> 03:37:26.633
AVAILABLE INCLUDING THOSE WHO

03:37:26.700 --> 03:37:28.402
ARE NOW -- COMPLAINING ABOUT

03:37:28.468 --> 03:37:29.770
THIS LEGISLATION.

03:37:29.836 --> 03:37:31.772
SO THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE IS NOT

03:37:31.838 --> 03:37:33.774
GOING TO STYMIE THE INNOVATION

03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:35.909
OR THE PRESENCE OF THESE ITEMS

03:37:35.976 --> 03:37:37.544
ON THE STREET.

03:37:37.611 --> 03:37:39.146
ANOTHER GRAVE CONCERN IS WITHIN

03:37:39.212 --> 03:37:41.815
THESE CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS.

03:37:41.882 --> 03:37:43.550
ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK.

03:37:43.617 --> 03:37:45.018
AND I READ ONE OF THE OUR

03:37:45.085 --> 03:37:46.453
OPPONENTS SAYING THIS IS A FUN

03:37:46.520 --> 03:37:48.955
NEW ATHLETIC TYPE OF SPORT.

03:37:49.022 --> 03:37:50.924
AND ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK IS A

03:37:50.991 --> 03:37:53.293
LOT LIKE PLAYING IN FOOTBALL OR

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.162
OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE TYPE.

03:37:55.228 --> 03:37:56.630
WELL SIMILAR TO THE ANALOGY JUST

03:37:56.696 --> 03:37:57.697
MADE.

03:37:57.764 --> 03:37:59.900
IF YOU RENT A CONVERTIBLE IT

03:37:59.966 --> 03:38:01.168
MIGHT BE FUN WITH THE WIND

03:38:01.234 --> 03:38:02.702
BLOWING THROUGH YOUR HAIR AND

03:38:02.769 --> 03:38:04.304
YOU MAY ENJOY THE DRIVE.

03:38:04.371 --> 03:38:05.172
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU SHOULD

03:38:05.238 --> 03:38:07.007
ASSUME THE REST OF THAT CAR IS

03:38:07.073 --> 03:38:08.909
GOING TO LOSE ITS WHEELING

03:38:08.975 --> 03:38:09.776
YOU'RE GOING TO DRIVE OFF THE

03:38:09.843 --> 03:38:11.378
EDGE OF THE PACIFIC COAST

03:38:11.445 --> 03:38:12.245
HIGHWAY.

03:38:12.312 --> 03:38:14.114
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES YOU WITH AN

03:38:14.181 --> 03:38:15.649
ENJOYABLE BENEFIT.

03:38:15.715 --> 03:38:16.917
THE OTHER THING IS A RELEASE AND

03:38:16.983 --> 03:38:18.685
WAIVER OF LIABILITY AND THAT

03:38:18.752 --> 03:38:20.620
WOULD INCLUDE THE MANUFACTURER

03:38:20.687 --> 03:38:22.489
WHO MAY MAKE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT

03:38:22.556 --> 03:38:23.723
OF THE FALLS APART OR BRAKE

03:38:23.790 --> 03:38:25.225
FAILURE.

03:38:25.292 --> 03:38:28.595
SO THE TECHNOLOGY IS BENEFICIAL

03:38:28.662 --> 03:38:30.263
THE IDEA IS GOOD.

03:38:30.330 --> 03:38:32.499
IT MUST HOWEVER BE REGULATED TO

03:38:32.566 --> 03:38:33.767
PROTECT THE CONSUMERS IT CAN'T

03:38:33.834 --> 03:38:35.435
MERELY BE.

03:38:35.502 --> 03:38:36.803
A RELEASE ON TO THE STREET A

03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:38.405
COLLECTION OF REVENUE BUT NO

03:38:38.472 --> 03:38:41.408
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE THE

03:38:41.475 --> 03:38:43.043
IMPACTS THAT THESE HAVE ON

03:38:43.109 --> 03:38:44.444
SOCIETY WITH THE PRODUCTS

03:38:44.511 --> 03:38:45.745
BECAUSE WHEN MOST PEOPLE GET

03:38:45.812 --> 03:38:47.180
INJURED IF THEY'RE PEDESTRIANS

03:38:47.247 --> 03:38:47.914
ARE AT CETERA.

03:38:47.981 --> 03:38:49.449
THAT FALLS UPON THE CITIES THE

03:38:49.516 --> 03:38:50.884
COUNTIES IN THE STATE TO PAY

03:38:50.951 --> 03:38:52.085
THEIR MEDICAL BILLS.

03:38:52.152 --> 03:38:53.653
SO THAT SHOULD BE REFLECTED

03:38:53.720 --> 03:38:55.455
WITHIN THE INSURANCE SO THAT IT

03:38:55.522 --> 03:38:56.823
CAN BE SPREAD AMONGST ALL OF THE

03:38:56.890 --> 03:38:58.859
USERS AT A FRACTION OF A PENNY

03:38:58.925 --> 03:38:59.960
PER RIDE.

03:39:00.026 --> 03:39:01.261
RATHER THAN PERHAPS HAVING --

03:39:01.328 --> 03:39:02.729
MEDI CAL PICK UP A HALF MILLION

03:39:02.796 --> 03:39:03.964

INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS WILL

03:41:23.169 --> 03:41:24.104
START THERE.

03:41:24.170 --> 03:41:26.172
THE BILL REQUIRES A STAGGERING

03:41:26.239 --> 03:41:27.874
MINIMUM OF FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

03:41:27.941 --> 03:41:32.479
pTHAT WHICH IS FAR IN EXCESS OF

WHAT CITIES AROUND THE WORLD

03:41:33.747 --> 03:41:35.281
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY

03:41:35.348 --> 03:41:36.750
REQUIRE THE BILL WOULD ALSO

03:41:36.816 --> 03:41:38.418
REQUIRE THE IT INDUSTRY TO

THIS IS THE THE USER OR CONTACT

03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:51.231
ISSUE THAT THE AUTHOR IS TALKING

03:41:51.297 --> 03:41:53.466
ABOUT SO JUST AS AN EXAMPLE I

OVER THE HEAD WITH IT THIS GOOD

03:42:00.907 --> 03:42:01.675
OUR COMPANY THAT IRAQ.

SHOULD WE BE HELD LIABLE FOR

03:42:09.282 --> 03:42:11.418
THAT -- THAT ACTUALLY MAKES IT

03:42:11.484 --> 03:42:13.119
SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE YOU KNOW NO

03:42:13.186 --> 03:42:15.488
INCENTIVE TO NOT DO BAD THINGS

03:42:15.555 --> 03:42:16.690
WHEN THEY'RE RENTING THE IS I'M

YOU KNOW PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO

03:42:20.293 --> 03:42:21.995
DO THAT DESPITE THE COMPARISONS

03:42:22.062 --> 03:42:23.797
MADE BY THE BILL'S SPONSOR AND

03:42:23.863 --> 03:42:25.165
REFLECT IN THE ANNOUNCED IT IS

03:42:25.231 --> 03:42:26.533
IT IS NOT ACCURATE SUGGEST THAT

03:42:26.599 --> 03:42:27.834
THE INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ANY

03:42:27.901 --> 03:42:30.003
MARKET ANYWHERE TO MAINTAIN THIS

03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:32.272
TYPE OF INSURANCE -- WE AGREE

03:42:32.338 --> 03:42:33.173
THAT THERE SHOULD BE A

03:42:33.239 --> 03:42:35.141
REASONABLE UNIFORM STANDARD WHEN

03:42:35.208 --> 03:42:38.178
IT COMES TO INSURANCE -- BUT WE

03:42:38.244 --> 03:42:39.713
HAVE YOU KNOW WANT TO MAKE VERY

03:42:39.779 --> 03:42:41.481
CLEAR THAT THE WHAT'S CURRENTLY

03:42:41.548 --> 03:42:44.551
IN THE BILL AND IS NOT WORKABLE --

03:42:44.617 --> 03:42:45.251
YOU KNOW THERE IS AN AB

03:42:45.318 --> 03:42:46.553
REFERENCE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

03:42:46.619 --> 03:42:48.521
COULD BANKRUPT COMPANIES -- AND

03:42:48.588 --> 03:42:50.690
SO I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE

03:42:50.757 --> 03:42:52.358
AUTHOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON ON

03:42:52.425 --> 03:42:54.060
THIS BILL AND THE BILL ALSO

03:42:54.127 --> 03:42:55.862
PROPOSES REMOVING A COMPANIES

03:42:55.929 --> 03:42:58.031
RIGHT TO INCLUDE WAIVER RELEASE

03:42:58.098 --> 03:42:59.399

AGREEMENTS WHICH ARE STANDARD

03:43:00.967 --> 03:43:02.302
CLAUSES DESIGNED TO PROTECT

COMPANIES FROM LIABILITY. FOR

03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:05.572
INCIDENTS BECAUSE THROUGH NO

03:43:05.638 --> 03:43:07.540
FAULT OF THEIR OWN THERE IS NO

03:43:07.607 --> 03:43:09.042
REASON WHY SHARED M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; BUILT&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:43:09.109 --> 03:43:10.744
MICRA MOBILITY SHOULD BE SINGLED

03:43:10.810 --> 03:43:12.145
OUT AMONG INDUSTRIES IN

03:43:12.212 --> 03:43:14.114
CALIFORNIA FOR SUCH LIMITATIONS

03:43:14.180 --> 03:43:16.850
ON THEIR FREEDOM OF CONTRACT.

03:43:16.916 --> 03:43:19.285
FINALLY A LOCAL CONTROL -- SO

03:43:19.352 --> 03:43:20.253
THE BILL YOUR SERVICE LOCAL

03:43:20.320 --> 03:43:22.322
CONTROL BY PROHIBITING PILOTS

03:43:22.388 --> 03:43:24.457
ARE OFFERING THESE SERVICES TO

03:43:24.524 --> 03:43:25.658
BECAUSE CUSTOMERS BEFORE A

03:43:25.725 --> 03:43:28.228
DETAILED ORDINANCES ESTABLISHED.

03:43:28.294 --> 03:43:29.696
THIS RESTRICTION IS SIMPLY DOES

03:43:29.763 --> 03:43:30.864
NOT REFLECT THE APPROACH THAT

03:43:30.930 --> 03:43:32.365
SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE

03:43:32.432 --> 03:43:34.334
TAKEN AND MAY PREFER IT ALSO

03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:35.902
DOES NOT REFLECT THAT THERE ARE

03:43:35.969 --> 03:43:37.704
SOME BIG CITIES CAN THAT CAN YOU

03:43:37.771 --> 03:43:39.405
KNOW HAVE THE MANPOWER TO DO

03:43:39.472 --> 03:43:40.974
THESE ORDINANCES AND OTHERS MAY

03:43:41.040 --> 03:43:42.976
WANT TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM FIRST.

03:43:43.042 --> 03:43:44.911
AND YOU KNOW FIGURE IT OUT AND

03:43:44.978 --> 03:43:46.279
THEN MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE

03:43:46.346 --> 03:43:47.680
THE STAFF TO TAKE ON AN WHOLE

03:43:47.747 --> 03:43:49.149
ORDINANCE TO WORK THROUGH THAT

03:43:49.215 --> 03:43:50.016
PROCESS.

03:43:50.083 --> 03:43:51.384
AND SO WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL

03:43:51.451 --> 03:43:53.186
SEVERELY LIMIT ACCESS TO THIS

03:43:53.253 --> 03:43:54.687
NECK NEW TECHNOLOGY IN

03:43:54.754 --> 03:43:56.389
CALIFORNIA WOULD DENY CALIFORNIA

03:43:56.456 --> 03:44:01.828
FROM ADOPTING A RAIDER WAY TO

GET TO A PLACE WHERE THIS BILL

03:47:07.714 --> 03:47:09.382

03:47:09.449 --> 03:47:12.352
LITTLE BIT PERPLEXED BY THIS

03:47:12.418 --> 03:47:13.186
DISCUSSION AROUND MY ABILITY

03:47:13.252 --> 03:47:15.154
BECAUSE AS I LISTEN TO THIS

03:47:15.221 --> 03:47:17.256
STORY -- I WOULD THINK

03:47:17.323 --> 03:47:19.025
NEGLIGENCE LAW WOULD APPLY THAT

03:47:19.092 --> 03:47:20.526
IF THE COMPANY WERE NEGLIGENT IN

03:47:20.593 --> 03:47:22.895
KEEPING UP THE SCOOTER AND

03:47:22.962 --> 03:47:23.563
SCOOTER DUE TO AS WHAT'S

03:47:23.629 --> 03:47:25.131
DESCRIBED THE COMPANY WOULD BE

03:47:29.369 --> 03:47:30.670
THERE'S A HOLE THERE THAT WE

03:47:30.737 --> 03:47:32.271
NEED TO FELL BUT NONE THE LESS I

03:47:32.338 --> 03:47:34.140
THINK AS LONG AS IT'S CLEAR.

03:47:34.207 --> 03:47:36.142
THAT IT'S YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS

03:47:36.209 --> 03:47:38.044
INCUMBENT UPON THE COMPANY'S

03:47:38.111 --> 03:47:39.912
RESPONSE IT WAS.

03:47:39.979 --> 03:47:40.546
IT WAS THE NEGLIGENCE OR COMPANY

03:47:40.613 --> 03:47:41.914
ENOUGH TO TO NEGLIGENCE THE USER

03:47:41.981 --> 03:47:43.916
THAT I'M COMFORTABLE BUT I YOU

03:47:43.983 --> 03:47:45.385
KNOW IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME WHY

03:47:45.451 --> 03:47:46.019
THAT'S NECESSARY MAYBE YOU HAVE

03:47:46.085 --> 03:47:46.986
AN ANSWER.

03:47:47.053 --> 03:47:48.354
YES I CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR YOU

03:47:48.421 --> 03:47:50.623

03:47:50.690 --> 03:47:51.724
TECHNET AND THE OTHERS WANT TO

03:47:51.791 --> 03:47:53.292
HAVE A COMPLETE RELEASE AND

03:47:53.359 --> 03:47:55.128
WAIVER OF ALL LIABILITY FOR

03:47:55.194 --> 03:47:56.529
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SCOOTERS

03:47:56.596 --> 03:47:58.097
INCLUDING THEIR FAILURE TO

03:47:58.164 --> 03:47:59.465
MAINTAIN THEM.

03:47:59.532 --> 03:48:03.036

CLICKING ACCEPT AGREEMENTS.

03:48:15.615 --> 03:48:16.649
THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THIS

03:48:16.716 --> 03:48:18.217
BILL IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT

03:48:18.284 --> 03:48:19.552
DOES NOT HAPPEN.

03:48:19.619 --> 03:48:21.954
AS FAR AS PICKING UP A SCOOTER

03:48:22.021 --> 03:48:22.522
AND HITTING SOMEONE OVER THE

03:48:22.588 --> 03:48:23.189
HEAD WITH IT.

03:48:23.256 --> 03:48:24.924
THAT WOULD NOT LEAD TO LIABILITY

03:48:24.991 --> 03:48:26.626
OF THE COMPANY ANYMORE THAN IT

03:48:26.692 --> 03:48:27.860
WOULD BE IF SOMEONE OR PICK UP A

PARK BENCH AND SLAMMING ON

03:48:29.228 --> 03:48:30.696

03:54:05.131 --> 03:54:06.399
THE RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE THAT

03:54:06.465 --> 03:54:08.134
THAT OCCURRED BY THIS GROUP THE

03:54:08.200 --> 03:54:12.204
IRA -- THEY ACTUALLY.

03:54:12.271 --> 03:54:13.639
MADE FAKE ACCOUNTS.

03:54:13.706 --> 03:54:14.707
TARGETED TOWARDS DIFFERENT

03:54:14.774 --> 03:54:17.676
GROUPS OF PEOPLE -- AND THEY AND

03:54:17.743 --> 03:54:19.345
THEY RELEASE FAKE INFORMATION

03:54:19.412 --> 03:54:20.746
BASICALLY.

03:54:20.813 --> 03:54:21.881
WITH THE WITH THE GOAL OF AN

03:54:21.947 --> 03:54:22.882
CITING.

03:54:22.948 --> 03:54:25.484
THOSE GROUPS. TO TO ACTION INTO

03:54:25.551 --> 03:54:27.086
EVEN THOUGH THE INFORMATION IT

03:54:27.153 --> 03:54:28.654
CONTAINED IN THOSE CONTAINING

03:54:28.721 --> 03:54:30.423
THOSE THINGS WASN'T TRUE.

03:54:30.489 --> 03:54:32.191
AND WE'VE MADE OURSELVES.

03:54:32.258 --> 03:54:34.560
SORT OF EASY TARGETS BY THIS BY

03:54:34.627 --> 03:54:36.829
THIS POLARIZATION AND BY WHAT

03:54:36.896 --> 03:54:38.931
HAS HAPPENED ON SOCIAL MEDIA --

03:54:38.998 --> 03:54:40.933
I ALSO JUST FROM MY OWN PERSONAL

03:54:41.000 --> 03:54:42.201
EXPERIENCE.

03:54:42.268 --> 03:54:44.236
I'VE REALIZED.

03:54:44.303 --> 03:54:46.672
THAT IN MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE.

03:54:46.739 --> 03:54:49.041
I'VE BEEN SURROUNDED BY LIBERALS.

03:54:49.108 --> 03:54:50.810
YEAH I WAS OUT AS YOU KNOW I

03:54:50.876 --> 03:54:53.746
GREW UP IN A VERY RURAL AREA --

03:54:53.813 --> 03:54:56.348
BUT WENT TO UC BERKELEY YOU KNOW

03:54:56.415 --> 03:54:58.651
FOR FOR MY UNDERGRAD I WAS I WAS

03:54:58.717 --> 03:55:00.119
CERTAINLY IN THE MINORITY.

03:55:00.186 --> 03:55:02.788
YOU IN THAT PLACE IN TERMS OF OF

03:55:02.855 --> 03:55:04.423
MY OF MY VIEW POINT.

03:55:04.490 --> 03:55:07.460
AND THEN I WENT ON YOU KNOW TO

03:55:07.526 --> 03:55:09.295
ACTUALLY SERVE HERE AS A FELLOW --

03:55:09.361 --> 03:55:11.630
AND THEN ULTIMATELY CAME TO THIS

03:55:11.697 --> 03:55:12.665
PLACE YOU KNOW TO THIS CAPITAL

03:55:12.731 --> 03:55:14.867
WHERE AGAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE

03:55:14.934 --> 03:55:16.569
BENEFITTED I THINK FROM BEING

03:55:16.635 --> 03:55:17.970
ABLE TO HEAR.

03:55:18.037 --> 03:55:19.839
THE OTHER SIDE OF OF OF

03:55:19.905 --> 03:55:21.574
VIEWPOINTS HERE MULTIPLE

03:55:21.640 --> 03:55:24.210
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES -- AND SO

03:55:24.276 --> 03:55:25.945
IN IN MY OWN LIFE IN EVEN THOUGH

03:55:26.011 --> 03:55:28.781
IT DIDN'T WORK YOU GUYS DIDN'T

03:55:28.848 --> 03:55:31.484
CONVERT ME -- I HAVE.

03:55:31.550 --> 03:55:32.384
I WOULD SAY THAT [inaudible]

03:55:32.451 --> 03:55:33.953
YOU KNOW.

03:55:34.019 --> 03:55:35.488
AND I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU CAN

03:55:35.554 --> 03:55:38.090
APPRECIATE THIS -- TO BECAUSE IT

03:55:38.157 --> 03:55:39.225
WORKS BOTH WAYS YOU GAIN A

03:55:39.291 --> 03:55:40.392
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE

03:55:40.459 --> 03:55:41.460
PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM WHAT

03:55:41.527 --> 03:55:42.895
THEIR PERSPECTIVES ARE.

03:55:42.962 --> 03:55:44.697
EVEN IF YOU DON'T ULTIMATELY

03:55:44.763 --> 03:55:47.132
AGREE ON A POINT -- YOU BECOME

03:55:47.199 --> 03:55:48.534
MUCH MORE WELL ROUNDED MUCH MORE

03:55:48.601 --> 03:55:51.136
INFORMED -- AND MUCH BETTER TO

03:55:51.203 --> 03:55:52.972
BE ABLE TO RELATE IN A CIVIL

03:55:53.038 --> 03:55:56.575
SOCIETY -- AND SO I THINK THE

03:55:56.642 --> 03:55:57.743
ANSWER TO SOME OF THIS

03:55:57.810 --> 03:55:59.745
POLARIZATION IS REALLY TO ENSURE

03:55:59.812 --> 03:56:01.447
THAT THERE IS MORE SPEECH AND

03:56:01.514 --> 03:56:03.015
THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF

03:56:03.082 --> 03:56:04.550
CENSORSHIP THAT HAS BEEN.

03:56:04.617 --> 03:56:07.353
THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING -- I

03:56:07.419 --> 03:56:08.954
THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

03:56:09.021 --> 03:56:10.656
THAT THESE PLATFORMS FACEBOOK

03:56:10.723 --> 03:56:11.423
AND TWITTER.

03:56:11.490 --> 03:56:13.125
HAVE BECOME.

03:56:13.192 --> 03:56:14.159
PLACES WHERE WE'RE HAVING

03:56:14.226 --> 03:56:15.361
DISCUSSIONS OF MAJOR PUBLIC

03:56:15.427 --> 03:56:16.862
CONCERN.

03:56:16.929 --> 03:56:18.364
THERE PLACES WHERE WE'RE HAVING

03:56:18.430 --> 03:56:19.865
AN ELECTION PERIOD.

03:56:19.932 --> 03:56:21.233
WHERE A LOT OF YOU KNOW

03:56:21.300 --> 03:56:24.136
CAMPAIGNS ARE WON AND LOST ON

03:56:24.203 --> 03:56:25.237
INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING

03:56:25.304 --> 03:56:27.573
OUT ON ON THESE PLATFORMS?

03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:29.174
AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET NEWS

03:56:29.241 --> 03:56:30.276
NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE GET THEIR

03:56:30.342 --> 03:56:32.044
NEWS JUST BY LOOKING AT THEIR

03:56:32.111 --> 03:56:34.880
TWITTER FEED -- SO IN THAT CASE

03:56:34.947 --> 03:56:37.283
HOW THOSE PLATFORMS ARE MANAGED

03:56:37.349 --> 03:56:38.851
AND WHO DOES THE MANAGING

03:56:38.918 --> 03:56:42.588
MATTERS -- AND I THINK THAT --

03:56:42.655 --> 03:56:43.656
YOU KNOW.

03:56:43.722 --> 03:56:45.190
THIS DOES HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND

03:56:45.257 --> 03:56:46.058
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO THINK

03:56:46.125 --> 03:56:47.560
ABOUT THIS BUT I THINK THE

03:56:47.626 --> 03:56:49.461
ANALYSIS WHICH THE ANALYSIS I

03:56:49.528 --> 03:56:50.930
THINK WAS GREAT ON THIS.

03:56:50.996 --> 03:56:52.097
MR Là ME.

03:56:52.164 --> 03:56:54.066
YOU KNOW I THINK COVERED ALL THE

03:56:54.133 --> 03:56:55.601
ISSUES BUT HERE'S WHAT I THINK

03:56:55.668 --> 03:56:57.169
IT REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:56:57.236 --> 03:56:58.771
ANALYSIS THIS IS THE MAJOR POINT.

03:56:58.837 --> 03:57:01.440
IS IT THIS BILL ACKNOWLEDGES AND

03:57:01.507 --> 03:57:02.808
THIS IS ON PAGE SEVEN THIS BILL

03:57:02.875 --> 03:57:04.109
ACKNOWLEDGES THE STRONG PUBLIC

03:57:04.176 --> 03:57:05.477
POLICY ARGUMENT.

03:57:05.544 --> 03:57:07.212
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA WEBSITE SHOULD

03:57:07.279 --> 03:57:09.081
BE PERMITTED TO EXERCISE THEIR

03:57:09.148 --> 03:57:10.983
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. TO NOT

03:57:11.050 --> 03:57:13.018
ALLOW CERTAIN SPEECH ON THEIR

03:57:13.085 --> 03:57:13.752
PLATFORMS.

03:57:13.819 --> 03:57:15.321
WHILE STILL SEEKING TO REDUCE

03:57:15.387 --> 03:57:17.323
THE LIKELIHOOD THAT CONTENT

03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:19.592
REGULATION WILL BE BASED ON

03:57:19.658 --> 03:57:21.093
POLITICAL POLITICAL IDEOLOGY.

03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:22.394
IT STRIKES THAT BALANCE UNDER

03:57:22.461 --> 03:57:24.597
THIS BILL.

03:57:24.663 --> 03:57:25.931
THOSE PLATFORMS WILL STILL BE

03:57:25.998 --> 03:57:28.534
ABLE TO TAKE OFF ANY SPEECH THAT

03:57:28.601 --> 03:57:31.003
IS INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE IT'S

03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:33.205
OBSCENITY THAT HATE SPEECH.

03:57:33.272 --> 03:57:36.842
AND THEY CAN ALSO REMOVE ANY.

03:57:36.909 --> 03:57:38.844
YOUR POSTS OR TWEETS THAT WOULD

03:57:38.911 --> 03:57:40.346
BE INCONSISTENT.

03:57:40.412 --> 03:57:41.714
WITH THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS

03:57:41.780 --> 03:57:42.915
THAT THEY'VE OUTLINED AS HEY

03:57:42.982 --> 03:57:45.217
THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD WE WOULD

03:57:45.284 --> 03:57:47.486
ACCEPT ON OUR SITES -- AND IT

03:57:47.553 --> 03:57:48.854
MAKES THAT VERY CLEAR.

03:57:48.921 --> 03:57:50.756
AND SO LOOK I THINK THAT THIS

03:57:50.823 --> 03:57:52.257
STRIKES THE BOUNCE NOW SOME.

03:57:52.324 --> 03:57:54.193
THE LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT COMES IN

03:57:54.259 --> 03:57:54.893
HERE IS A THESE SITES ARE

03:57:54.960 --> 03:57:56.261
PRIVATE.

03:57:56.328 --> 03:57:58.030
THEY'RE NOT LIKE GOVERNMENT --

03:57:58.097 --> 03:57:59.732
AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS

03:57:59.798 --> 03:58:01.800
CONCERNED WITH GOVERNMENT THAT'S

03:58:01.867 --> 03:58:02.601
TRUE.

03:58:02.668 --> 03:58:04.236
BUT RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE

03:58:04.303 --> 03:58:06.572
WERE THE FIRST THE CALIFORNIA

03:58:06.639 --> 03:58:07.740
STATE SUPREME COURT.

03:58:07.806 --> 03:58:09.074
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO

03:58:09.141 --> 03:58:10.576
RECOGNIZE IS THAT PRIVATE

03:58:10.643 --> 03:58:12.745
PROPERTY PRIVATE PLATFORMS CAN

03:58:12.811 --> 03:58:14.980
BECOME LIMITED PUBLIC FORMS.

03:58:15.047 --> 03:58:16.148
AND THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE

03:58:16.215 --> 03:58:17.983
ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE THE

03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:21.620
PRUNE YARD -- SHOPPING MALL CASE.

03:58:21.687 --> 03:58:23.255
IN WHICH THE COURT FOUND THAT

03:58:23.322 --> 03:58:24.423
PEOPLE THAT WERE.

03:58:24.490 --> 03:58:27.326
HANDING OUT FLYERS INFORMATION

03:58:27.393 --> 03:58:30.496
IN A PRIVATE SHOPPING MALL -- AS

03:58:30.562 --> 03:58:31.263
WERE IN FACT LET AND THEY

03:58:31.330 --> 03:58:33.298
COULDN'T BAR THEM FROM DOING SO

03:58:33.365 --> 03:58:34.900
THEY CAN BUY THEM FROM HANDING

03:58:34.967 --> 03:58:36.335
OUT THESE FLYERS.

03:58:36.402 --> 03:58:38.303
BECAUSE IT HAD BECOME A LIMITED

03:58:38.370 --> 03:58:40.105
PUBLIC FORUM IN THE COURT SAID.

03:58:40.172 --> 03:58:41.874
THAT IN RELEVANT PART.

03:58:41.940 --> 03:58:43.375
THIS BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT THAT

03:58:43.442 --> 03:58:44.009
HAS.

03:58:44.076 --> 03:58:45.644
HAS SET ITSELF OPEN TO THE

03:58:45.711 --> 03:58:46.445
PUBLIC.

03:58:46.512 --> 03:58:47.713
AND ALLOWED PEOPLE TO COME AND

03:58:47.780 --> 03:58:49.081
GO AS THEY PLEASE THE VIEWS

03:58:49.148 --> 03:58:50.282
EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE

03:58:50.349 --> 03:58:51.517
PUBLIC IN PASSING OUT THE

03:58:51.583 --> 03:58:54.787
PAMPHLETS OR SEEKING SIGNATURES

03:58:54.853 --> 03:58:55.087
[inaudible]

03:58:55.154 --> 03:58:58.157
MAKING POSTS -- FOR A FOR A

03:58:58.223 --> 03:58:59.458
PETITION ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE

03:58:59.525 --> 03:59:01.627
IDENTIFIED WITH THE SHOPPING

03:59:01.694 --> 03:59:02.695
MALL THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:59:02.761 --> 03:59:04.029
IDENTIFIED WITH THE PERSON

03:59:04.096 --> 03:59:05.197
MAKING THAT.

03:59:05.264 --> 03:59:07.933
MAKING THAT STATEMENT SO TO ON

03:59:08.000 --> 03:59:10.069
FACEBOOK AND TWITTER WE'RE NOT

03:59:10.135 --> 03:59:11.804
US YOU KNOW.

03:59:11.870 --> 03:59:13.205
WHEN SOMEONE MAKES A POST WHEN?

03:59:13.272 --> 03:59:15.274
WHEN WE GO ON AS WE DO OFTEN DO

03:59:15.340 --> 03:59:16.942
MANY OF US OUT THESE ACCOUNTS WE

03:59:17.009 --> 03:59:19.578
MAKE A STATEMENT ABOUT OUR

03:59:19.645 --> 03:59:22.681
BELIEFS -- BILLS THAT WERE

03:59:22.748 --> 03:59:23.282
WORKING ON THINGS THAT WE'RE

03:59:23.348 --> 03:59:24.850
DOING EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S A

03:59:24.917 --> 03:59:26.819
STATEMENT FROM US IT'S NOT A

03:59:26.885 --> 03:59:28.487
STATEMENT FROM FACEBOOK.

03:59:28.554 --> 03:59:29.321
IT'S NOT A STATEMENT FROM

03:59:29.388 --> 03:59:30.055
TWITTER.

03:59:30.122 --> 03:59:32.391
AND SO I THINK THAT THIS THIS

03:59:32.458 --> 03:59:33.959
FITS RIGHT INTO THAT MOULD OF

03:59:34.026 --> 03:59:35.994
CALIFORNIA LAW THAT WAS

03:59:36.061 --> 03:59:37.596
ESTABLISHED.

03:59:37.663 --> 03:59:38.864
SPEAKING OF SEVERAL DECADES AGO

03:59:38.931 --> 03:59:41.433
ACTUALLY -- AND AND I THINK IT

03:59:41.500 --> 03:59:43.202
RECOGNIZES THAT LOOK WE DO NEED

03:59:43.268 --> 03:59:44.737
TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT THERE

03:59:44.803 --> 03:59:46.405
IS MORE SPEECH.

03:59:46.472 --> 03:59:47.639
THAT THERE IS THAT THAT PEOPLE

03:59:47.706 --> 03:59:49.341
ARE GETTING MULTIPLE VIEWPOINTS

03:59:49.408 --> 03:59:50.743
AND ARE NOT GETTING INTO THESE

03:59:50.809 --> 03:59:52.144
ISOLATED BUBBLES WHERE WE ARE

03:59:52.211 --> 03:59:54.213
VULNERABLE.

03:59:54.279 --> 03:59:55.180
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE

03:59:55.247 --> 03:59:58.016
VULNERABLE TO THESE TYPE OF OF

03:59:58.083 --> 04:00:00.219
ATTACKS THAT WE'VE SEEN.

04:00:00.285 --> 04:00:01.687
I THINK THIS IS ONE ANSWER TO IT

04:00:01.754 --> 04:00:03.155
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER THINGS

04:00:03.222 --> 04:00:04.156
THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO AS

04:00:04.223 --> 04:00:07.192
WELL -- BUT WE CAN'T HAVE

04:00:07.259 --> 04:00:08.694
CENSORSHIP AND I THINK THIS

04:00:08.761 --> 04:00:10.062
AGAIN THIS STRIKES THE RIGHT

04:00:10.129 --> 04:00:11.396
BALANCE PRESERVING.

04:00:11.463 --> 04:00:12.664
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS TO TAKE DOWN

04:00:12.731 --> 04:00:14.233
SPEECH OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT

04:00:14.299 --> 04:00:15.367
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR TERMS AND

04:00:15.434 --> 04:00:17.469
CONDITIONS -- THAT'S NOT

04:00:17.536 --> 04:00:20.305
CONSISTENT WITH OBVIOUSLY VALUES

04:00:20.372 --> 04:00:22.808
OBSCENE ALL OF THAT -- BUT THEN

04:00:22.875 --> 04:00:24.109
ALSO SAYS WE'RE NOT GONNA BAR

04:00:24.176 --> 04:00:26.044
PEOPLE JUST BASED ON THERE

04:00:26.111 --> 04:00:27.880
POLITICALVIEW POINTS -- SO I

04:00:27.946 --> 04:00:29.014
WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON

04:00:29.081 --> 04:00:30.716
THIS ON THIS LEGISLATION WE

04:00:30.783 --> 04:00:32.451
WORKED ON IT SINCE LAST YEAR AND

04:00:32.518 --> 04:00:34.086
MADE IT A BETTER BILL -- AND I

04:00:34.153 --> 04:00:34.953
THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:00:35.020 --> 04:00:36.922
ANALYSIS -- THE ANALYSIS WOULD

04:00:36.989 --> 04:00:39.158
AGREE WITH THAT AND SO I'D ASK

04:00:39.224 --> 04:00:41.460

SIMILAR NUMBER GALLAGHER IS GOAL.

04:01:21.834 --> 04:01:23.335
HOWEVER HIS BILLS THIS BILL IS

04:01:23.402 --> 04:01:24.770
BASED ON A FLAWED PREMISE THE

04:01:24.837 --> 04:01:26.371
MODERATION DECISIONS ARE BASED

04:01:26.438 --> 04:01:28.006
ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT.

04:01:28.073 --> 04:01:29.408
ONLINE PLATFORMS AND FORCE THE

ONLINE AND OFF.

04:01:34.713 --> 04:01:36.048
THIS REQUIRES REMOVING CONTENT

04:01:36.114 --> 04:01:37.916
THE POSES A THREAT OF HARM. TO

04:01:37.983 --> 04:01:39.451
THE PUBLIC AND PERSONAL SAFETY

04:01:39.518 --> 04:01:41.720
OR CONTENT FOR PROMOTING HATRED

04:01:41.787 --> 04:01:42.287
OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CERTAIN

GROUPS [inaudible]

04:01:43.555 --> 04:01:45.891
ALLEGATIONS THAT PLATFORMS

ENGAGE IN PRACTICES LIKE SHADOW

04:01:47.392 --> 04:01:48.493
BANNING AGAINST CONSERVATIVE

COMMENTATORS ARE UNFOUNDED.

04:01:50.295 --> 04:01:51.296
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS BILL

04:01:51.363 --> 04:01:52.898
IN PIZZA PLATFORMS ABILITY TO

04:01:52.965 --> 04:01:54.299
MODERATE TROLLS SPREADING

CLAIMING THAT SANDY HOOK.

04:02:02.274 --> 04:02:03.475
TRAGEDY WAS A HOAX IT IS

04:02:03.542 --> 04:02:05.811
UNACCEPTABLE.

04:02:05.878 --> 04:02:07.312
THE ANSWER TO NEEDING MORE

04:02:07.379 --> 04:02:08.113
SPEECH IS NOT THIS TYPE OF

04:02:08.180 --> 04:02:10.282

04:02:15.787 --> 04:02:16.989
TO DO MORE MODERATION TO DO A

04:02:17.055 --> 04:02:18.757
BETTER WE ARE LEARNING.

04:02:18.824 --> 04:02:21.727
AND THIS BILL WORKS AGAINST THAT.

04:02:21.793 --> 04:02:23.228
IN A FOUNDATIONAL LEVELS ALSO

04:02:23.295 --> 04:02:24.663
OFTEN VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFINE

04:02:24.730 --> 04:02:25.998
WHAT IS POLITICAL.

04:02:26.064 --> 04:02:27.065
NOT ALL PEOPLE FIND THE SAME

04:02:27.132 --> 04:02:28.867
ISSUES TO BE POLITICAL.

04:02:28.934 --> 04:02:30.202
SO FRAMING THINGS AS POLITICAL

04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:32.738
OR NOT ON A CASE BY CASE POST BY

04:02:32.804 --> 04:02:36.642
POST BASIS IS ONYX UNWORKABLE -

04:02:36.708 --> 04:02:37.676
AND IS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT

04:02:37.743 --> 04:02:39.378
THAT ONE PERSON'S POLITICAL

04:02:39.444 --> 04:02:39.912
SPEECH IS ANOTHER PERSON'S

04:02:39.978 --> 04:02:41.380
INCITEMENT.

04:02:41.446 --> 04:02:42.614
PEOPLE USE THESE PLATFORMS

04:02:42.681 --> 04:02:43.215
BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO FIND

04:02:43.282 --> 04:02:44.816
CONTENT THEY LIKE SOME USERS ONE

04:02:44.883 --> 04:02:46.618
PARTICULAR CONTENT SOME USERS AS

04:02:46.685 --> 04:02:47.953
THE PLATFORMS NOT TO SHOW THEM

04:02:48.020 --> 04:02:49.621
CONTENT THEY FIND OBJECTIONABLE.

04:02:49.688 --> 04:02:50.355
THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE THE

04:02:50.422 --> 04:02:51.957
PLATFORMS TOOLS TO SERVE THEIR

04:02:52.024 --> 04:02:53.158
USERS.

04:02:53.225 --> 04:02:54.126
FINALLY IT'S NOT CLEAR WITH THIS

04:02:54.192 --> 04:02:56.061
BILL REQUIRED TO THE EXTENT THAT

04:02:56.128 --> 04:02:57.863
ENVISIONS PLATFORMS LISTING OUT

04:02:57.930 --> 04:02:59.064
TYPES OF POLITICAL SPEECH IS

04:02:59.131 --> 04:03:00.265
ACCEPTABLE ACCEPTABLE OR

04:03:00.332 --> 04:03:02.534
UNACCEPTABLE BE HOLY AND HELPFUL

04:03:02.601 --> 04:03:04.036
TO HELP THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE.

04:03:04.102 --> 04:03:05.304
IF IT'S SUGGESTING THE CON THE

04:03:05.370 --> 04:03:06.538
PLATFORMS CAN ONLY MODERATE

04:03:06.605 --> 04:03:08.040
CONTENT THAT VIOLATES EXISTING

04:03:08.106 --> 04:03:09.441
TERMS OF SERVICE AND THAT'S

04:03:09.508 --> 04:03:11.009
UNNECESSARY DUPLICATIVE AND WILL

04:03:11.076 --> 04:03:12.711
HIGHLIGHT -- COMPLETELY

04:03:12.778 --> 04:03:14.379
ERRONEOUS REASONS THE CONTENT IS

04:03:14.446 --> 04:03:15.747
MODERATED.

04:03:15.814 --> 04:03:17.115
SO WE THINK THAT THIS BILL

04:03:17.182 --> 04:03:18.917
CONFUSES USERS UNNECESSARILY THE

04:03:18.984 --> 04:03:20.018
TEARS FROM CLEAR CONTENT

04:03:20.085 --> 04:03:21.486
OPERATION STANDARDS AND IMPEDES

04:03:21.553 --> 04:03:22.955
IN THAT MODERATION.

04:03:23.021 --> 04:03:24.523
THANK YOU THANK YOU ADDITIONAL

04:03:24.589 --> 04:03:26.091

04:03:40.272 --> 04:03:41.573
SO WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

04:03:41.640 --> 04:03:43.041

SURE DO YOU HAVE A COUPLE

04:03:48.981 --> 04:03:50.282
CONCERNS THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE

04:03:50.349 --> 04:03:52.084
IS -- WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN

04:03:52.150 --> 04:03:53.051
ACTUALLY GET TO WHAT YOU'RE

04:03:53.118 --> 04:03:54.886
TRYING TO GET OUT AND THAT THIS

04:03:54.953 --> 04:03:56.488
IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.

04:03:56.555 --> 04:03:57.689
I MEAN IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THT

04:03:57.756 --> 04:03:59.224
THE BETTER FOCUS WOULD BE ON THE

04:03:59.291 --> 04:04:00.826
ALGORITHMS THAT PLATFORMS USE

04:04:00.892 --> 04:04:02.260
NOT NECESSARILY.

04:04:02.327 --> 04:04:04.429
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT YOU

04:04:04.496 --> 04:04:05.931
KNOW GOOGLE SEARCHES ANOTHER

04:04:05.998 --> 04:04:08.433
SEARCH ENGINE PLATFORMS THAT OP --

04:04:08.500 --> 04:04:12.170
IMPLEMENT ALGORITHMS -- THAT --

04:04:12.237 --> 04:04:15.407
FOCUS MORE ON WHAT WE WHAT WE

04:04:15.474 --> 04:04:17.275
PUT INTO THAT THAT THE SEARCH

04:04:17.342 --> 04:04:18.443
BARS AND THEN THEY CONTINUE TO

04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:19.444
SHOW US INFORMATION THAT THEY

04:04:19.511 --> 04:04:20.912
THINK WE WANT TO SEE RATHER THAN

04:04:20.979 --> 04:04:21.780
MORE.

04:04:21.847 --> 04:04:23.615
UNFILTERED INFORMATION -- SO

04:04:23.682 --> 04:04:25.417
THAT WE ARE WORLD VIEW IN TERMS

04:04:25.484 --> 04:04:26.385
OF WHAT WE'RE SEARCH SEARCHING

04:04:26.451 --> 04:04:28.086
ON ON A SEARCH ENGINE IS MORE

04:04:28.153 --> 04:04:30.255
FOCUSED BASED ON WHAT THEY THINK

04:04:30.322 --> 04:04:32.491
WE WANT TO SEE OR WANT TO READ --

04:04:32.557 --> 04:04:34.292
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE SHOULD BE

04:04:34.359 --> 04:04:35.794
EXPOSED TO WHICH IS EVERYTHING

04:04:35.861 --> 04:04:37.129
IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS

04:04:37.195 --> 04:04:39.731
OR MULTIPLE DIFFERENT --

04:04:39.798 --> 04:04:42.834
PERSPECTIVES -- I I JUST YOU

04:04:42.901 --> 04:04:44.236
KNOW WHAT MY I HAVE A BIG

04:04:44.302 --> 04:04:47.039
CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT.

04:04:47.105 --> 04:04:48.707
HE WE ARE.

04:04:48.774 --> 04:04:50.609
PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO

04:04:50.675 --> 04:04:52.144
ALLOW HATE SPEECH WHICH ISN'T

04:04:52.210 --> 04:04:54.212
ALWAYS.

04:04:54.279 --> 04:04:56.448
SPEECH THAT IS OVER AT AND AND

04:04:56.515 --> 04:05:01.319
THERE'S A THERE'S A WAY TO SPEAK --

04:05:01.386 --> 04:05:02.254
OR TO USE HATE SPEECH WITHOUT IT

04:05:02.320 --> 04:05:03.822
NECESSARILY SOUNDING VARIANCE IN

04:05:03.889 --> 04:05:05.724
THE AREA ARE LIKE YOU ARE USING

04:05:05.791 --> 04:05:07.025
HATE SPEECH AND PROVIDING

04:05:07.092 --> 04:05:08.326
PROTECTION UNDER THIS LAW AND

04:05:08.393 --> 04:05:10.695
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW -- FOR THAT

04:05:10.762 --> 04:05:12.531
TYPE OF SPEECH OR PROVIDING

04:05:12.597 --> 04:05:13.532
POTENTIAL PROTECTION FOR

04:05:13.598 --> 04:05:14.533
SOMEBODY THAT'S TRYING TO

04:05:14.599 --> 04:05:16.134
INFLUENCE AN ELECTION INS INFO

04:05:16.201 --> 04:05:17.402
INFLUENCE A CIVIL DISCOURSE OF

04:05:17.469 --> 04:05:19.604
ALL OF OF OUR STATE.

04:05:19.671 --> 04:05:21.773
OUR BY PROTECTING CERTAIN KIND

04:05:21.840 --> 04:05:23.141
OF SPEECH BECAUSE I'M SAYING

04:05:23.208 --> 04:05:24.843
IT'S POLITICAL SPEECH OF THAT'S

04:05:24.910 --> 04:05:26.011
MY POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE THAT'S

04:05:26.078 --> 04:05:27.145
POLITICAL SPEECH AND THEN IS

04:05:27.212 --> 04:05:28.046
PROTECTED IN.

04:05:28.113 --> 04:05:29.314
AND THEN THAT BECOMES AN

04:05:29.381 --> 04:05:29.915
INTERESTING QUESTION AT THAT

04:05:29.981 --> 04:05:32.084
GOES TO COURT ABOUT HOW YOU

04:05:32.150 --> 04:05:33.718
DIFFERENTIATE YOU KNOW.

04:05:33.785 --> 04:05:34.920
IS THIS POLITICAL SPEAKERS IS

04:05:34.986 --> 04:05:36.088
NOT POLITICAL SPEECH FOR SUCH

04:05:36.154 --> 04:05:37.089
GREAT AT THAT QUITE A JUDGMENT

04:05:37.155 --> 04:05:38.090
THAT AN INTERNET COMPANY OR

04:05:38.156 --> 04:05:39.458
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES CAN HAVE

04:05:39.524 --> 04:05:40.525
TO MAKE ON THE ROUND OF WHETHER

04:05:40.592 --> 04:05:41.426
OR NOT THIS IS A POLITICAL

04:05:41.493 --> 04:05:42.961
SPEECH OR NOT POLITICAL SPEECH.

04:05:43.028 --> 04:05:44.563
AND THEN I COULD JUST SEE THIS

04:05:44.629 --> 04:05:46.932
COMING BACK -- TO IF THIS EVER

04:05:46.998 --> 04:05:48.166
WENT TO COURT COMING BACK TO THE

04:05:48.233 --> 04:05:49.101
LEAD IN THE COURT SAYING YOU GOT

04:05:49.167 --> 04:05:50.368
TO GO BACK TO LEGISLATION

04:05:50.435 --> 04:05:50.902
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MORE

04:05:50.969 --> 04:05:51.903
CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT THIS

04:05:51.970 --> 04:05:55.240
ACTUALLY MEANS -- BECAUSE AS

I DO HAVE.

04:06:07.686 --> 04:06:08.286
THOSE TYPES OF CONCERNS BUT THEN

04:06:08.353 --> 04:06:11.623
ALSO I KEEP FALLING BACK ON IS

04:06:11.690 --> 04:06:13.925
IS THIS REALLY A PROBLEM -- AND

WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE ACTUAL

04:06:16.728 --> 04:06:17.496
PROBLEM THAT REALLY TRYING TO

COMPANIES ARE DESCRIBING SAYING

04:07:01.106 --> 04:07:02.374
BECAUSE IT IT DOESN'T HELP A

04:07:02.440 --> 04:07:03.942
COMPANY TO BE BANNING REALLY

04:07:04.009 --> 04:07:05.710
ANYBODY FOR ANYTHING -- BUT THE

YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE THOSE ARE

04:07:11.783 --> 04:07:13.351
MY HOPE HIGH PROFILE INDIVIDUALS

04:07:13.418 --> 04:07:14.819
THAT ARE BEING BANNED THOSE ARE

04:07:14.886 --> 04:07:15.987
THE ONES THAT COME TO MIND SEEM

pPLATFORM IS BEATING UP ON A

04:07:19.257 --> 04:07:21.493
CONSERVATIVE -- THE INDIVIDUAL

04:07:40.045 --> 04:07:42.280
POLITICAL BANTUS SO IT MAY SEEM

04:07:42.347 --> 04:07:43.248
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE

04:07:43.315 --> 04:07:44.482
NEWS THAT IT TENDS TO BE MORE

04:07:44.549 --> 04:07:45.951

NECESSARILY MEAN IT'S

04:07:46.518 --> 04:07:47.586
REPRESENTATIVE.

04:07:47.652 --> 04:07:49.287
OF THE ACTUAL PLATFORM BANNING

04:08:10.075 --> 04:08:10.842
TRYING TO GET OUT WHAT YOU'RE

04:08:10.909 --> 04:08:11.309
TRYING TO GET OUT IN.

04:08:11.376 --> 04:08:13.612
IF THAT'S REALLY POSSIBLE TO DO

04:08:13.678 --> 04:08:16.114
I A I A I THINK THAT.

04:08:16.181 --> 04:08:19.417
POLITICAL SPEECH ARE WHEN DONE

04:08:19.484 --> 04:08:21.119
IN IN THAT IN THAT ON IT WITH

04:08:21.186 --> 04:08:22.420
THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE

04:08:22.487 --> 04:08:25.490
KNOW THAT MEANS IS SHOULD BE.

04:08:25.557 --> 04:08:26.358
YOU KNOW SHOULD BE SEEN AS THAT

04:08:26.424 --> 04:08:28.260
AND SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENTIATED

04:08:28.326 --> 04:08:29.494
WHETHER IT'S A CONSERVATIVE YOU

04:08:29.561 --> 04:08:32.364
ARE LIBERAL VIEW -- BUT I JUST

04:08:32.430 --> 04:08:35.400
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT BASED ON THE

04:08:35.467 --> 04:08:37.035
ROLE SOCIAL MEDIA HAS PLAYED IN

04:08:37.102 --> 04:08:38.436
THE SPEECH ENDS UP ON SOCIAL

04:08:38.503 --> 04:08:39.771
MEDIA AND HOW IT INFLUENCE.

04:08:39.838 --> 04:08:41.339
INFLUENCE A CIVIL DISCOURSE IN

04:08:41.406 --> 04:08:42.574
OUR SOCIETY HOW IT INFLUENCES

04:08:42.641 --> 04:08:45.510
OUR POLITICS -- THAT THESE

04:08:45.577 --> 04:08:46.945
PLATFORMS THE TO BE ABLE TO

04:08:47.012 --> 04:08:48.747
EXERCISE THEIR ABILITY TO TO

04:08:48.813 --> 04:08:51.383
REMOVE THINGS -- THAT ARE EITHER

04:08:51.449 --> 04:08:54.452
OVER OR NOT OVER -- IN IN A IN

04:08:54.519 --> 04:08:55.420
THIS.

04:08:55.487 --> 04:08:57.789
MAKES THAT MORE COMPLICATED IN

04:08:57.856 --> 04:08:59.858
MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE HOW DO

04:08:59.924 --> 04:09:00.725
YOU.

04:09:00.792 --> 04:09:03.495
HOW DO YOU CHARGE A PLATFORM OF

04:09:03.561 --> 04:09:04.262
BEING ABLE TO DECIDE?

04:09:04.329 --> 04:09:05.830
YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING IS HATE

04:09:05.897 --> 04:09:10.502
SPEECH UP OR POLITICAL SPEECH

04:09:10.568 --> 04:09:12.971
WHEN IT'S NOT RIGHT IN YOUR FACE --

04:09:13.038 --> 04:09:15.006
SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE

04:09:15.073 --> 04:09:16.841
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE BUT AGAIN I

04:09:16.908 --> 04:09:18.476
THIS IS A TOUGH ISSUE TO TAKE ON

04:09:18.543 --> 04:09:19.844
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU CAN

04:09:19.911 --> 04:09:21.346
TAKE THIS ON AN IMMUNOLOGIST

04:09:21.413 --> 04:09:22.213
OBVIOUSLY SOME FROM HARD YOU'RE

04:09:22.280 --> 04:09:23.581
DOING WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT.

04:09:23.648 --> 04:09:25.216
AND AND GENERALLY WHEN I DON'T

04:09:25.283 --> 04:09:26.685
HAVE SUPPORT ON BILLS IS BECAUSE

04:09:26.751 --> 04:09:30.088
IT THERE WAS MY IDEA.

04:09:30.155 --> 04:09:30.822
YOU KNOW.

04:09:30.889 --> 04:09:32.123
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT GOOD

04:09:32.190 --> 04:09:34.125
IT'S A GOOD IDEA JUST MEANS I'M

04:09:34.192 --> 04:09:34.993
THE ONLY ONE THAT CLEARLY CARES.

04:09:35.060 --> 04:09:39.431
SO -- YOU KNOW I I I I I I I

04:09:39.497 --> 04:09:40.832
THINK THAT -- WHAT YOU'RE DOING

04:09:40.899 --> 04:09:41.633
IT IS A COMPLIMENT WHAT WHAT

04:09:41.700 --> 04:09:43.234
YOU'RE DOING IS -- IT IS

04:09:43.301 --> 04:09:45.170
COMMENDABLE I I JUST I I WORRY

04:09:45.236 --> 04:09:46.204
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GET THERE

04:09:46.271 --> 04:09:47.572
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

04:09:47.639 --> 04:09:49.407
CAN DO WITH IN STATE LAW AND

04:09:49.474 --> 04:09:50.075
THEN IT GOES INTO WHETHER OR NOT

04:09:50.141 --> 04:09:51.109
THERE SHOULD BE.

04:09:51.176 --> 04:09:53.211

REALLY HARD TO TAKE TO GET TO A

04:10:26.978 --> 04:10:28.680
PLACE TO SUPPORT THIS I DON'T

04:10:28.747 --> 04:10:31.216
THINK I'M THERE -- A AND IT'S

04:10:31.282 --> 04:10:33.118
IT'S ECONOMY AS MISTER CALDERON

04:10:34.652 --> 04:10:36.121
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND IT'S

04:10:36.187 --> 04:10:37.922
NOT WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA

04:10:37.989 --> 04:10:43.495
COMPANIES OR ANY COMPANIES

04:10:43.561 --> 04:10:43.795
[inaudible]

04:10:43.862 --> 04:10:45.697
BEST -- KIND OF STRATEGY. TO

04:10:45.764 --> 04:10:46.798
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY

04:10:46.865 --> 04:10:48.566
POLITICAL PARTY ESPECIALLY IN A

04:10:48.633 --> 04:10:50.668
COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE SO DIVIDED

04:10:50.735 --> 04:10:51.302
AND DO YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THAT

04:10:51.369 --> 04:10:52.804
YOU'RE GOING TO PISS OFF A LOT

04:10:52.871 --> 04:10:53.738
OF CUSTOMERS AND AND THAT

04:10:53.805 --> 04:10:55.740
DOESN'T SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S

04:10:55.807 --> 04:10:58.710
INTENTIONALLY HAPPENING -- AND

04:10:58.777 --> 04:11:00.345
THEY SAID THAT WOULD BE THE

04:11:00.412 --> 04:11:01.613
COSTS ARE THAT WOULD BE THE

04:11:01.679 --> 04:11:02.881
BENEFIT THE COST.

04:11:02.947 --> 04:11:03.648
AS CHAIR OF THE ELECTIONS

04:11:03.715 --> 04:11:04.516
COMMITTEE AND AND HAVING

04:11:04.582 --> 04:11:06.251
AUTHORED BILLS AROUND THIS ISSUE

04:11:06.317 --> 04:11:07.652
I REALLY DO WORRY ABOUT.

04:11:07.719 --> 04:11:11.122
THE FACT THAT THIS MIGHT CAUSE

04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:13.358
COMPANIES TO PAUSE.

04:11:13.425 --> 04:11:15.493
IN REMOVING CONTENT FROM THEIR

04:11:15.560 --> 04:11:17.729
PLATFORMS THERE REALLY IS A HARM

04:11:17.796 --> 04:11:19.197
TO THE PUBLIC WHETHER IT'S ARMED

04:11:19.264 --> 04:11:21.533
OUR DEMOCRACY OR WHETHER IT'S A

04:11:21.599 --> 04:11:26.004
THE HARMED OUR PUBLIC SAFETY IN

04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:27.839
TERMS OF OF YES AND SURROUND

04:11:27.906 --> 04:11:28.773
VACCINATIONS ARE OPPOSING

04:11:28.840 --> 04:11:29.641
VACCINATIONS A YOU KNOW.

04:11:29.707 --> 04:11:31.810
THERE'S A LOT OF WE KNOW AS YOU

04:11:31.876 --> 04:11:33.077
ALLUDED TO THAT THESE PLATFORMS

04:11:33.144 --> 04:11:34.746
CAN BE WEAPONIZED FOR BAD -- AND

04:11:34.813 --> 04:11:36.347
I THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THESE

04:11:36.414 --> 04:11:40.318
PLATFORMS MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO

04:11:40.385 --> 04:11:42.220
TO TRY -- TO DEBT PUSH BACK

04:11:42.287 --> 04:11:44.522
AGAINST THAT AND I WORRY THAT

04:11:44.589 --> 04:11:46.491
THIS BILL WILL HARM THEIR

04:11:46.558 --> 04:11:47.826
ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THAT'S A

04:11:47.892 --> 04:11:50.528
HUGE HALL -- IT'S A HUGE COST IN

04:11:50.595 --> 04:11:52.096
MY MIND AND SO AND SO THE COST

04:11:52.163 --> 04:11:53.498
BENEFIT ANALYSIS JUST DOESN'T

04:11:53.565 --> 04:11:55.567
WAY OUT BUT I TOTALLY APPRECIATE

04:11:55.633 --> 04:11:56.734
I AGREE WITH.

04:11:56.801 --> 04:11:58.470
THE FACT THAT WE ARE TO POLARIZE

04:11:58.536 --> 04:11:59.671
I THINK THAT I DO HAVE BIG

04:11:59.737 --> 04:12:01.706
CONCERNS AROUND THE ALGORITHMS

04:12:01.773 --> 04:12:02.874
THAT ARE USED BY THESE COMPANIES

04:12:02.941 --> 04:12:05.977
THAT CREATE THESE ECHO CHAMBERS

04:12:06.044 --> 04:12:07.479
YOU KNOW -- MAKE THINGS THAT

04:12:07.545 --> 04:12:11.316
MUCH WORSE -- AND YEAH REALLY

04:12:11.382 --> 04:12:12.116
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS FOR

04:12:12.183 --> 04:12:15.887
THIS ISSUE -- AND LOOK FORWARD

04:12:15.954 --> 04:12:16.454
TO WORKING WITH YOU ON MORE

04:12:16.521 --> 04:12:17.388
ISSUES.

04:12:17.455 --> 04:12:18.790
THANK YOU ON THE SPOT OKAY AND

04:12:18.857 --> 04:12:20.158
YEAH I AM I WANT TO THANK YOU

04:12:20.225 --> 04:12:23.561
FOR YOUR COMMENTS I I ABSOLUTE

04:12:23.628 --> 04:12:25.129
GRIEVING BEING IN THIS BODY FOR

04:12:25.196 --> 04:12:26.431
JUST A FEW MONTHS I KNOW I'M

04:12:26.498 --> 04:12:27.765
BETTER FOR THE DIVERSITY OF

04:12:27.832 --> 04:12:28.967
THOUGHT THAT IS SHARED AMONG

04:12:29.033 --> 04:12:31.302
STATUS -- YOU INCLUDED AND I

04:12:31.369 --> 04:12:33.505
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT

04:12:33.571 --> 04:12:35.173
BUT I ALSO AM CONCERNED WITH.

04:12:35.240 --> 04:12:36.641
I ACTUALLY LOVE THE BREVITY AND

04:12:36.708 --> 04:12:39.043
CLARITY OF THE LAWS THE BRINGING

04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:40.678
FORWARD BUT THE BUT THE BREVITY

04:12:40.745 --> 04:12:42.647
OF THIS ONE DOES GIVE ME PAUSE

04:12:42.714 --> 04:12:43.114
BECAUSE I DO HEAR THE

04:12:43.181 --> 04:12:43.982
OPPOSITION'S.

04:12:44.048 --> 04:12:45.984
PROBLEMS AND I THINK THERE ARE

04:12:46.050 --> 04:12:47.051
THESE CONCERNS WITH.

04:12:47.118 --> 04:12:49.153
HOW WILL THEY DEAL WITH THE

04:12:49.220 --> 04:12:50.555
THINGS THAT I THINK HOPEFULLY WE

04:12:50.622 --> 04:12:52.156
ALL AGREE ARE HARMFUL TO

04:12:52.223 --> 04:12:52.857
POLITICAL DISCOURSE AND TO

04:12:52.924 --> 04:12:55.360
FERRET FREE ELECTIONS AND SO

04:12:55.426 --> 04:12:56.461
TAKING THAT FREEDOM AWAY FROM

04:12:56.528 --> 04:12:57.195
THEM?

04:12:57.262 --> 04:12:58.963
IS NOT BENEFICIAL ESPECIALLY

04:12:59.030 --> 04:13:00.365
GIVEN THAT THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM

04:13:00.431 --> 04:13:01.165
BEFORE US THAT.

04:13:01.232 --> 04:13:02.767
APPEARS TO BE NEED TO BE

04:13:02.834 --> 04:13:04.702
CORRECTED BUT I DO THINK I MEAN

04:13:04.769 --> 04:13:06.304
PER YARD WITH WHAT I THOUGHT OF

04:13:06.371 --> 04:13:08.506
WHEN I READ THIS -- I THINK THAT

04:13:08.573 --> 04:13:11.075
THE COURTS WILL THEY FIND THAT

04:13:11.142 --> 04:13:14.412
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE

04:13:14.479 --> 04:13:15.313
LIMITED PUBLIC FOR AT SOME POINT.

04:13:15.380 --> 04:13:15.947
I THINK IT'S OUT THERE I DON'T

04:13:16.014 --> 04:13:17.215
THINK THAT'S A CLEAR ANSWER BUT

04:13:17.282 --> 04:13:19.050
I GET BELIEVE THAT'S BEST IN THE

04:13:19.117 --> 04:13:20.652
HANDS OF THE JUDICIARY WHO WILL

04:13:20.718 --> 04:13:21.686
DO A VERY.

04:13:21.753 --> 04:13:23.221
SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS ON THE

04:13:23.288 --> 04:13:24.556
THINGS YOU MENTIONED WHETHER OR

04:13:24.622 --> 04:13:26.224
NOT THEY ARE FOR AND THAT.

04:13:26.291 --> 04:13:28.726
SHOULD BE -- AB THOSE FIRST

04:13:28.793 --> 04:13:30.461
AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS ARE

04:13:30.528 --> 04:13:32.297
APPLICABLE TO AND THEN.

04:13:32.363 --> 04:13:34.432
GOING FOR WHAT THAT MEANS SO

04:13:34.499 --> 04:13:37.468
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS.

04:13:37.535 --> 04:13:39.237
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHAMUS KILEY.

04:13:39.304 --> 04:13:40.705
SO I WAS THAT A LITTLE SKEPTICAL

04:13:40.772 --> 04:13:42.373
AND THIS IDEA WAS BROUGHT LAST

04:13:42.440 --> 04:13:44.442
YEAR BUT I THINK THAT -- IN I IF

04:13:44.509 --> 04:13:45.343
I'M NOT MISTAKEN THERE ARE A

04:13:45.410 --> 04:13:47.011
COUPLE CHANGES THIS YEAR THAT --

04:13:47.078 --> 04:13:48.880
pI THINK OUR OUR BIG IMPROVEMENTS

04:13:48.947 --> 04:13:49.480
TO MAKE THE BILL MORE WORKABLE

04:13:49.547 --> 04:13:51.115
WHERE IT SAYS THAT -- YOU

04:13:51.182 --> 04:13:52.984
ACTUALLY ARE ALLOWED -- TO

04:13:53.051 --> 04:13:54.485
FILTER CONTENT ON THE BASIS OF

04:13:54.552 --> 04:13:55.887
POLITICS OR ANYTHING ELSE ALONG

04:13:55.954 --> 04:13:56.854
WITH THAT'S DISCLOSED IN YOUR

04:13:56.921 --> 04:13:58.690
TERMS OF USE AND SO YOU CAN HAVE

04:13:58.756 --> 04:14:01.059
A WEBSITE THAT CATERS TO A

04:14:01.125 --> 04:14:02.260
PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW AND

04:14:02.327 --> 04:14:02.794
DOESN'T LIKE.

04:14:02.860 --> 04:14:03.795
HAVING ANYTHING ELSE THERE AND

04:14:03.861 --> 04:14:05.330
THAT'S FINE YOU JUST GOT TO BE

04:14:05.396 --> 04:14:07.799
UP FRONT ABOUT IT -- AND ALL

04:14:07.865 --> 04:14:08.666
RAISES A SECOND WHAT A LITTLE

04:14:08.733 --> 04:14:09.534
BIT MORE ABOUT OF THE SOME OF

04:14:09.601 --> 04:14:10.268
THE OTHER COMMENTS THAT HAVE

04:14:10.335 --> 04:14:12.470
BEEN MADE -- IS.

04:14:12.537 --> 04:14:13.905
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WOULD HAVE TO

04:14:13.972 --> 04:14:17.575
CUT SOME STANDARDS OUT OF WHOLE

04:14:17.642 --> 04:14:18.610
CLOTH IN DETERMINING.

04:14:18.676 --> 04:14:20.011
NGUYEN -- CONTENT IS BEING

04:14:20.078 --> 04:14:21.879
CENSORED ON THE BASIS OF

04:14:21.946 --> 04:14:23.615
POLITICAL AFFILIATION -- THERE'S

04:14:23.681 --> 04:14:24.649
A WELL ESTABLISHED MY MISS THE

04:14:24.716 --> 04:14:26.184
AUTHOR'S PRESENTATION BUT OVER

04:14:26.250 --> 04:14:27.018
THIS BUT THERE'S WELL

04:14:27.085 --> 04:14:28.720
ESTABLISHED CASE LAW AROUND

04:14:28.786 --> 04:14:29.787
FIRST AMENDMENT JURISPRUDENCE

04:14:29.854 --> 04:14:31.122
FOR LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS WHEN

04:14:31.189 --> 04:14:32.757
YOU CAN -- DETERMINE WHETHER

04:14:32.824 --> 04:14:33.925
YOU'RE SHUTTING SOMEONE DOWN IN

04:14:33.992 --> 04:14:34.859
THE MALL ON THE BASIS THAT

04:14:34.926 --> 04:14:36.494
POLITICS OR ON A LEGITIMATE

04:14:36.561 --> 04:14:38.162
BASIS LIKE THEY'RE CREATING A

04:14:38.229 --> 04:14:39.497
DISTURBANCE OR SOMETHING ALONG

04:14:39.564 --> 04:14:41.466
THOSE LINES SO I THINK THAT --

04:14:41.532 --> 04:14:43.067
THE BILL AS PRESENTED NOT

04:14:43.134 --> 04:14:45.236
PRESENTED NOW REPRESENTS A A

04:14:45.303 --> 04:14:46.804
PRETTY THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO

04:14:46.871 --> 04:14:48.806
WHAT I'VE YOU AS AS A REAL

04:14:48.873 --> 04:14:50.041
PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE.

04:14:50.108 --> 04:14:52.210
A FORUM THAT HOLDS ITSELF OUT AS

04:14:52.276 --> 04:14:54.145
A PUBLIC FORUM BUT UNBEKNOWNST

04:14:54.212 --> 04:14:57.548
TO THE USERS -- IS -- IS CAUSING

04:14:57.615 --> 04:14:59.317
SOME CONTENT NOT TO BE SEEN I

04:14:59.384 --> 04:15:00.718
THINK THAT'S REALLY PROBLEMATIC

04:15:00.785 --> 04:15:02.020
AND I THINK THE AUTHORS DONE A

04:15:02.086 --> 04:15:03.021
GOOD JOB TO ADDRESSES SO I'M

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:04.088
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL EVEN

04:15:04.155 --> 04:15:06.758
THOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE I SUPPORT

04:15:06.824 --> 04:15:08.993
IT LAST YEAR.

04:15:09.060 --> 04:15:10.061
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR OBERNOLTE.

04:15:10.128 --> 04:15:10.595
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN

04:15:10.662 --> 04:15:12.664
LIKEWISE I DON'T THINK I SUPPORT

04:15:12.730 --> 04:15:14.065
THIS BILL LAST YEAR EITHER.

04:15:14.132 --> 04:15:15.667
BUT YOU'VE ADDED SOMETHING I

04:15:15.733 --> 04:15:17.001
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH

04:15:17.068 --> 04:15:18.569
IS THAT SENSE THAT SAYS.

04:15:18.636 --> 04:15:19.537
THE SHALL NOT REMOVE OR

04:15:19.604 --> 04:15:20.972
MANIPULATE CONTENT EXCEPT AS

04:15:21.039 --> 04:15:22.473
PROVIDED BY.

04:15:22.540 --> 04:15:24.175
THE SOCIAL MEDIAS TERMS AND

04:15:24.242 --> 04:15:25.543
CONDITIONS OF USE SITE A

04:15:25.610 --> 04:15:27.045
QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION.

04:15:27.111 --> 04:15:28.379
WHICH IS THAT WITH THAT

04:15:28.446 --> 04:15:29.914
PROVISION IN THERE I MEAN IF THE

04:15:29.981 --> 04:15:31.849
CONTENTION IS -- WE NEED TO

04:15:31.916 --> 04:15:32.684
STILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE HATE

04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:34.185
SPEECH SURE WE STILL NEED TO BE

04:15:34.252 --> 04:15:34.986
ABLE TO MOVE.

04:15:35.053 --> 04:15:37.188
REMOVE -- THINGS THAT THAT WE

04:15:37.255 --> 04:15:38.656
THINK ARE ACCURATE -- WHAT IF

04:15:38.723 --> 04:15:40.024
YOU JUST SAY THAT WE RESERVE THE

04:15:40.091 --> 04:15:41.492
RIGHT TO DO THOSE THINGS IN YOUR

04:15:41.559 --> 04:15:42.260
TERMS AND CONDITIONS WHY DOES

04:15:42.326 --> 04:15:43.027
THAT?

04:15:43.094 --> 04:15:44.495
NOT GIVE YOU THE AUTHORITY TO DO

04:15:44.562 --> 04:15:47.231
THAT WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A

04:15:47.298 --> 04:15:48.966
CONCERN WITH THE BILL.

04:15:49.033 --> 04:15:49.600
I THINK IT'S GONNA PART GIVE --

04:15:49.667 --> 04:15:50.601
HESITATION. TO THE PLATFORMS ARE

04:15:50.668 --> 04:15:52.070
SEEKING A MODERATE THAT TYPE OF

04:15:52.136 --> 04:15:54.105
CONTENT WHEN IT'S SOME.

04:15:54.172 --> 04:15:56.140
USERS VIEWED AS AND POLITICAL

04:15:56.207 --> 04:15:58.309
TERMS AND IT TO THE EXTENT THAT

04:15:58.376 --> 04:15:59.377
THIS BILLS.

04:15:59.444 --> 04:16:01.679
ASKING PLATFORMS TO LIST OUT

04:16:01.746 --> 04:16:03.181
VARIOUS TYPES OF POLITICAL

04:16:03.247 --> 04:16:05.016
FLAVORS OF POLITICAL SPEECH THAT.

04:16:05.083 --> 04:16:05.950
IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW WON'T ALLOW

04:16:06.017 --> 04:16:06.984
ON THE PLATFORM I DON'T THINK

04:16:07.051 --> 04:16:08.953
THAT HELPS ANYONE -- IN A

04:16:09.020 --> 04:16:10.755
LENGTHENING THE TERM SERVICE FOR

04:16:10.822 --> 04:16:11.989
ONE IS SOMETHING WE GET A LOT OF

04:16:12.056 --> 04:16:15.426
FLACK ON BUT I YOU KNOW. TO THE

04:16:15.493 --> 04:16:17.228
EXTENT THAT IT IS.

04:16:17.295 --> 04:16:19.197
THE BILL WAS READ TO ALLOW US TO

04:16:19.263 --> 04:16:20.732
MODERATE CONTENT BASED ON

04:16:20.798 --> 04:16:22.533
EXISTING TERMS OF SERVICE WHAT'S

04:16:22.600 --> 04:16:23.501
THE GAME.

04:16:23.568 --> 04:16:25.603
ALSO AND SO WHAT PUTTING THE

04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:28.639
POLITICAL -- PROHIBITION IN

04:16:28.706 --> 04:16:30.708
THERE THEN IT'S GOING TO CAUSE A

04:16:30.775 --> 04:16:33.010
WHOLE RANGE OF CON OF CONTENTS

04:16:33.077 --> 04:16:35.246
THAT IT WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE

04:16:35.313 --> 04:16:36.314
SOME OF THE COMMITTEE.

04:16:36.380 --> 04:16:37.815
AS POTENTIAL POLITICAL AND

04:16:37.882 --> 04:16:40.384
BECAUSE THE PLATFORMS A LOT OF

04:16:40.451 --> 04:16:41.786
DIFFICULTY IN AND MODERATE.

04:16:41.853 --> 04:16:43.421
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT.

04:16:43.488 --> 04:16:46.524
OKAY WELL THE I THINK IT'S OUR

04:16:46.591 --> 04:16:48.326
JOB HERE TO TRY AND STRIKE A

04:16:48.392 --> 04:16:50.194
BALANCE ON A COMPROMISE BETWEEN.

04:16:50.261 --> 04:16:51.629
SOCIETAL GOOD ON THE ONE HAND

04:16:51.696 --> 04:16:54.298
AND INCONVENIENCE TO CITIZENS

04:16:54.365 --> 04:16:54.966
AND BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA THE

04:16:55.032 --> 04:16:55.700
OTHER.

04:16:55.767 --> 04:16:57.001
AND LAST YEAR I DIDN'T THINK

04:16:57.068 --> 04:16:58.269
THAT THIS BILL WAS THERE THIS

04:16:58.336 --> 04:16:59.036
YEAR I ACTUALLY DO THINK IT'S

04:16:59.103 --> 04:17:00.538
THERE.

04:17:00.605 --> 04:17:02.907
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE.

04:17:02.974 --> 04:17:04.675
YOU COULD COMPLY WITH US -- IN

04:17:04.742 --> 04:17:06.344
HONOR THE SPIRIT OF IT NOW AND

04:17:06.410 --> 04:17:07.445
STILL BE ABLE TO DO THE THINGS

04:17:07.512 --> 04:17:08.613
THAT YOU SAY YOU NEED TO DO SO

04:17:08.679 --> 04:17:10.615
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL AND I

04:17:10.681 --> 04:17:12.183
I I DO THINK THAT -- THAT YOU'VE

04:17:12.250 --> 04:17:13.518
DONE A GREAT JOB OF SOMEONE THAT

04:17:13.584 --> 04:17:16.154
AND AND WORKING WITH THE

04:17:16.220 --> 04:17:17.622
OPPOSITION'S ON THIS.

04:17:17.688 --> 04:17:19.023
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR GABRIEL.

04:17:19.090 --> 04:17:20.691
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- SO I

04:17:20.758 --> 04:17:22.627
JUST WANTED -- TO IT SHARE MY

04:17:22.693 --> 04:17:24.095
THOUGHTS THE THE AUTHOR I HAD A

04:17:24.162 --> 04:17:25.163
LONG CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT A

04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:26.631
REALLY -- I I THINK A POSITIVE

04:17:26.697 --> 04:17:28.833
CONVERSATION FORCE I'M NOT QUITE

04:17:28.900 --> 04:17:29.433
THERE YET ON THE BILL I DON'T

04:17:29.500 --> 04:17:31.102
THINK THAT IT'S IN A PLACE THAT

04:17:31.169 --> 04:17:31.602
I CAN SUPPORT AND I DO

04:17:31.669 --> 04:17:32.770
APPRECIATE.

04:17:32.837 --> 04:17:34.238
HIS HIS PRINCIPLE APPROACH TO

04:17:34.305 --> 04:17:35.439
THIS I THINK HE'S COMING AT IT

04:17:35.506 --> 04:17:36.240
FROM THE RIGHT PLACE I THINK HE

04:17:36.307 --> 04:17:37.074
HAS.

04:17:37.141 --> 04:17:38.176
THE RIGHT VALUES AND MINE BUT I

04:17:38.242 --> 04:17:39.343
I BELIEVE THESE ARE SOME OF THE

04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:40.545
MOST CHALLENGING PUBLIC POLICY

04:17:40.611 --> 04:17:41.979
QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA FACE OVER

04:17:42.046 --> 04:17:42.780
THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES IS HOW

04:17:42.847 --> 04:17:44.415
DO WE REGULATE SPEECH ON THE

04:17:44.482 --> 04:17:46.818
INTERNET HOW TO WE ON ONE HAND --

04:17:46.884 --> 04:17:48.452
LEAVE OURSELVES THE OPPORTUNITY

04:17:48.519 --> 04:17:49.253
TO TO GET RID OF SOME OF THE

04:17:49.320 --> 04:17:50.655
REALLY -- TROUBLING AND SCARY

04:17:50.721 --> 04:17:52.657
HATE SPEECH AND DARK THINGS THAT

04:17:52.723 --> 04:17:53.257
WE SEE ON THE INTERNET BUT THE

04:17:53.324 --> 04:17:55.126
OTHER TIME PRESERVE FREEDOM OF

04:17:55.193 --> 04:17:57.061
SPEECH AND AND I THINK WE SHOULD

04:17:57.128 --> 04:17:58.629
PROCEED WITH REAL CAUTION HERE.

04:17:58.696 --> 04:18:00.765
AND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S

04:18:00.832 --> 04:18:02.433
THOUGHTFULNESS I KNOW THAT HE'S

04:18:02.500 --> 04:18:03.267
COMING FROM A GOOD PLACE BUT

04:18:03.334 --> 04:18:05.870
UNFORTUNATE THINK THAT THIS JUST

04:18:05.937 --> 04:18:07.705
NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE WORK.

04:18:07.772 --> 04:18:08.840
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHAUNA SCENE

04:18:08.906 --> 04:18:10.174
OR THE COMMONS.

04:18:10.241 --> 04:18:12.944
OR QUESTIONS OUT [inaudible]

04:18:13.010 --> 04:18:14.612
SEC HI.

04:18:14.679 --> 04:18:15.613
HONESTLY I STRUGGLE WITH IS A

04:18:15.680 --> 04:18:17.515
LITTLE BIT -- AS WE HEARD.

04:18:17.582 --> 04:18:19.016
OF THE AUTHOR BROAD THIS -- A

04:18:19.083 --> 04:18:21.652
SIMILAR BILL TO US LAST YEAR.

04:18:21.719 --> 04:18:24.622
AND I ENDED UP SUPPORTING AT OUT

04:18:24.689 --> 04:18:26.524
WITH HIS COMMITMENT TO PUT THOSE

04:18:26.591 --> 04:18:28.392
CHANGES IN.

04:18:28.459 --> 04:18:31.596
NOW SUBSEQUENT TO THE HEARING OF

04:18:31.662 --> 04:18:32.730
AT LEAST COUPLE THINGS OF A HAVE

04:18:32.797 --> 04:18:35.766
HAPPENED IN ONE OF WHICH WAS THE

04:18:35.833 --> 04:18:37.301
THE NEW ZEALAND SITUATION.

04:18:37.368 --> 04:18:39.470
ON AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS

04:18:39.537 --> 04:18:42.506
THE ON THE A CASE OF A COURT

04:18:42.573 --> 04:18:45.243
CASE AND THAT'S ALSO DESCRIBED

04:18:45.309 --> 04:18:46.744
IN THE ANALYSIS AND THAT'S THE

04:18:46.811 --> 04:18:50.114
OF THE TWITTER CASE -- THE ON

04:18:50.181 --> 04:18:52.083
ALL JOHNSON VERSUS TWITTER AND

04:18:52.149 --> 04:18:53.651
WHICH ACTUALLY CAME OUT.

04:18:53.718 --> 04:18:56.754
ADEN TO BE IN FAVOR OF TWITTER.

04:18:56.821 --> 04:18:58.422
SO THE QUESTION IN MY MIND WAS

04:18:58.489 --> 04:19:00.291
YOU KNOW IS IT A RIGHT TIME FOR

04:19:00.358 --> 04:19:02.760
US TO IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR US.

04:19:02.827 --> 04:19:04.695
TO TO REGULATE I MEAN DO WE WANT

04:19:04.762 --> 04:19:08.099
TO ENCOURAGE SOCIAL MEDIA. TO DO

04:19:08.165 --> 04:19:11.269
LESS OR MORE OFTEN IN WHEN IT

04:19:11.335 --> 04:19:13.271
COMES TO REGULATING SPEECH.

04:19:13.337 --> 04:19:14.171
I KNOW THAT THE COUPLE CYCLES

04:19:14.238 --> 04:19:17.575
AGO I ATTEMPTED -- TO WORK IN A

04:19:17.642 --> 04:19:19.277
SIMILAR VEIN AND THAT IS I TRY

04:19:19.343 --> 04:19:21.913
TO TACKLE THE ISSUE OF FAKE NEWS.

04:19:21.979 --> 04:19:24.248
N. -- OBVIOUSLY IT IN GO GO TOO

04:19:24.315 --> 04:19:26.384
FAR BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU

04:19:26.450 --> 04:19:28.619
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIRST NAME

04:19:28.686 --> 04:19:29.253
AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MINEFIELD

04:19:29.320 --> 04:19:30.888
SO -- SO IT'S IT'S A VERY

04:19:30.955 --> 04:19:33.391
DIFFICULT AREA TO KINDA NAVIGATE --

04:19:33.457 --> 04:19:35.660
I TO ADMIT BUT I DO WANT TO

04:19:35.726 --> 04:19:38.362
COMMEND -- MISTER GALLAGHER FOR

04:19:38.429 --> 04:19:40.031
VENTURING INTO AN AREA THAT I

04:19:40.097 --> 04:19:41.299
THINK.

04:19:41.365 --> 04:19:43.034
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MORE

04:19:43.100 --> 04:19:44.769
CLOSELY.

04:19:44.835 --> 04:19:46.604
SO I'M THAT'S THE REASON I GAVE

04:19:46.671 --> 04:19:49.974
A NINE RECOMMENDATIONS TO A

04:19:50.041 --> 04:19:51.642
MEMBERS ARE YOU KNOW FEEL FREE.

04:19:51.709 --> 04:19:53.778
TO VOTE THE WAY THEY SO DESIRE.

04:19:53.844 --> 04:19:56.480
I YOU KNOW.

04:19:56.547 --> 04:19:57.615
I I STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE

04:19:57.682 --> 04:19:59.817
DECISION WHETHER TO TO TO

04:19:59.884 --> 04:20:02.253
SUPPORT OR NOT BUT I I THINK OUR

04:20:02.320 --> 04:20:03.554
I WANT TO STAY CONSISTENT

04:20:03.621 --> 04:20:05.256
BECAUSE I I SUPPORTED YOUR BILL

04:20:05.323 --> 04:20:07.224
LAST YEAR -- WITH SIMILAR

04:20:07.291 --> 04:20:08.993
LANGUAGE AND AND IN HOPES THAT

04:20:09.060 --> 04:20:10.761
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO TO LOOK AT

04:20:10.828 --> 04:20:12.430
THIS ISSUE MORE CLOSELY BECAUSE

04:20:12.496 --> 04:20:14.699
THIS IS AN AREA LIKE I SAID IN A

04:20:14.765 --> 04:20:16.100
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO

04:20:16.167 --> 04:20:17.702
REALLY VENTURE INTO.

04:20:17.768 --> 04:20:20.204
ALSO I ADMIRE YOU FOR THAT --

04:20:20.271 --> 04:20:20.972
REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF

04:20:21.038 --> 04:20:23.040
TODAY'S HEARING -- TO SO WITH

04:20:23.107 --> 04:20:26.143
THAT I I'M GONNA ASK OUR THE

04:20:26.210 --> 04:20:28.412
BILL HAS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED.

04:20:28.479 --> 04:20:30.381
SO -- TO HIT IT SO SUPPOSED TO

04:20:30.448 --> 04:20:32.049
GO TO ARTS ENTERTAINMENT THAN

HELP ME MOVE THIS ALONG LET'S

04:21:21.032 --> 04:21:22.533
WORK ON THAT I THINK A LOT OF

04:21:22.600 --> 04:21:23.601
THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY

04:21:23.667 --> 04:21:25.002
THE OPPOSITION THEY CAN BE

04:21:25.069 --> 04:21:26.337
PLUGGED INTO THE TERMS AND

04:21:26.404 --> 04:21:27.605
CONDITIONS NUMBER.

04:21:27.671 --> 04:21:28.672
ONE BUT WE COULD ALSO WRITE

04:21:28.739 --> 04:21:30.374
THESE TYPES OF THINGS INTO THE

04:21:30.441 --> 04:21:32.009
BILL AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF

04:21:32.076 --> 04:21:33.310
THINGS THAT WE DO NEED TO

04:21:33.377 --> 04:21:35.179
DISCUSS BECAUSE HERE'S THE OTHER

04:21:35.246 --> 04:21:37.214
THING WE ALL AGREE ON IT'S BEEN

04:21:37.281 --> 04:21:38.382
WEAPONIZED.

04:21:38.449 --> 04:21:39.984
IN THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW

04:21:40.051 --> 04:21:42.953
TODAY OKAY IT'S BEEN WEAPONIZED

04:21:43.020 --> 04:21:44.722
UNDER THE CURRENT POLARIZATION

04:21:44.789 --> 04:21:45.823
UNDER THE CURRENT.

04:21:45.890 --> 04:21:47.224
YOU KNOW PEOPLE GOING INTO THEIR

04:21:47.291 --> 04:21:49.126
RESPECTIVE ECHO CHAMBERS THAT'S

04:21:49.193 --> 04:21:50.528
WHERE WE'RE VULNERABLE AND

04:21:50.594 --> 04:21:52.329
THAT'S WHERE. FOR EXAMPLE THE

04:21:52.396 --> 04:21:54.331
MULLER REPORTS SHOW THAT WERE

04:21:54.398 --> 04:21:54.632
VULNERABLE.

04:21:54.698 --> 04:21:57.034
AND YOU KNOW YEAH THE JUDICIARY

04:21:57.101 --> 04:21:59.503
COULD DECIDE THIS ISSUE I THINK.

04:21:59.570 --> 04:22:01.272
BY PASSING LEGISLATION IS ONE

04:22:01.338 --> 04:22:02.907
WAY TO GET IT TO GET IT TO THAT

04:22:02.973 --> 04:22:05.709
LEVEL RIGHT AND HAVE THEM DECIDE.

04:22:05.776 --> 04:22:07.344
YOU KNOW ONCE AND FOR ALL HEY

04:22:07.411 --> 04:22:09.146
WHAT IS THE SITUATION HERE BUT

04:22:09.213 --> 04:22:11.248
THE BOTTOM LINE IS LET'S WORK ON

04:22:11.315 --> 04:22:12.716
THIS BECAUSE IT ISN'T BEING.

04:22:12.783 --> 04:22:14.018

RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK IS IS
