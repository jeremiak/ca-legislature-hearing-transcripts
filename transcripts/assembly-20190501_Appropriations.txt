CARRILLO. CHAU. DEEP [inaudible] FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN [inaudible] PHONE [inaudible] GABRIEL [inaudible] GARCIA [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] NORTH. JUNE FIRST FOR COURT QUIRK PRESENT AND READY TO VOTE. YOU MAY PROCEED WITH THEIR OPPOSING ARGUMENT THINGS GET MORNING TURN MEMBERS MAKING ALL RIGHT ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. CONTINUING CONCERN OF THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN THE INCREASING COST OF HEALTHCARE IN THE STATE AND THIS BILL WILL SERVE TO FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT PROBLEM BY INCREASING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON PHYSICIANS AND MANDATING ADDITIONAL COSTS TO CONSUMERS. THERE UNNECESSARY REFERRALS FOR SERVICES WHICH ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE COVERED BY HEALTH PLANS RESULTING IN LARGE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THE UNNECESSARY CONVERSATION ABOUT NON PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS MANDATED IN THE INFORMED CONSENT TAKES AWAY FROM THE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS THAT CAN BE HAD. IN ALREADY SHORT APPOINTMENT TIMES THE MANDATED REFERRAL IF APPROPRIATE STILL LEAVES PATIENTS HOLDING THE BILL FOR THESE SERVICES AS THEY'RE TOLD THEY'RE RECEIVING A REFERRAL. BUT THIS ISN'T A REALITY IN MEDICINE OR REFERRAL IS THE THING IT'S OFTEN A PHYSICAL DOCUMENT TELLING PATIENTS TO SEE A SPECIFIC PROVIDER FOR SERVICE THAT WILL OFTEN BE COVERED BECAUSE OF THAT POSITION REFERRAL. THE PROPONENTS IMAGINE THE REFERRAL IN THIS BILL TO BE AKIN TO A SUGGESTION OR RECOMMENDATION SUCH AS LIKE A HOUSE PAINTER INFORMAL CASUAL AND NON COMMITTAL. THESE NON PHARMACOLOGICAL SERVICES ARE LARGELY LARGELY PAID FOR OUT OF POCKET AND PROVIDING A REFERRAL WILL GIVE A FALSE SENSE TO THE PATIENT THAT THEY'LL BE RECEIVING SOME SORT OF COVER BENEFIT. BECAUSE THEIR DOCTOR REFERRED THEM FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOU KNOW VOTE ON AB. EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT THANK YOU ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION. JERRY HEX REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS AND ALSO AT THE COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGIST IS RICK -- NINE LIKE IN MY COMMENTS ON THE POLICY TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WE ALSO I TALKED WITH -- OUR ATTORNEYS LAST NIGHT WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY. SO THERE MAY NOT BE COSTS -- TO THE STATE -- IN THE ANALYSIS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THEY'LL BE COSTS FOR PROVIDERS ALSO FOR PATIENTS AS WAS MENTIONED MANY OF THESE SERVICES ARE NOT COVERED UNDER INSURANCE OR MEDIC CAL -- BUT ALSO. THE CONSENSUS YOU KNOW WE DON'T LIVE IN AN ERA ANYMORE WHERE PEOPLE ARE JUST -- ADDING THINGS TO MEDICAL TIRED EVERYTHING'S ELECTRONIC AT THIS POINT AND SO ADDING THINGS -- WE ALREADY DO INFORMED CONSENT FOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR OTHER THINGS BY ADDING THINGS JUST YOU KNOW AS AN ITEM. ALSO MAKES US TO HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS MEDICAL RECORDS ARE DONE THAT'S VERY COSTLY TO PROVIDERS POTENTIALLY NOT EVEN POSSIBLE -- AND THEN IN ADDITION IF THERE'S A MANDATE FOR REFERRALS OR IN EVEN INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED -- SOMETIMES THAT'S OUTSIDE OF WHAT IS THE STANDARD OF CARE SO YOU'RE ASKING PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION SOME INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES. THAT MIGHT NOT BE A RECOMMENDED SERVICE BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF THEIR MEDICAL HOME AND SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SOME PHYSICIANS DON'T INHERENTLY KNOW. ABOUT CHIROPRACTORS SERVICES OR ACUPUNCTURE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S BEST YOU ALSO DO NOT NEED A REFERRAL FOR MOST OF THESE FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY WHICH IS WITHIN THE MEDICAL HOME AND MOST OF THOSE. FOLKS ARE WORKING -- WITHIN A MEDICAL GROUP THOSE REFERRALS THAT -- ARE APPROPRIATE AND ARE ALREADY DONE BUT YOU DON'T NEED A REFERRAL TO GO TO A CHIROPRACTOR AND YOU DON'T NEED A REFERRAL TO GO TO ACUPUNCTURE. SO PUTTING A MANDATE IN LAW FOR PHYSICIANS TO HAVE TO REFER OR EVEN GIVE INFORMATION. IS INAPPROPRIATE AND POTENTIALLY WE'RE PUTTING SOMETHING INTO A MAN ICAL RECORD THAT COULD BE -- A LIABILITY ISSUE TO THAT POSITION LATER ON SO FOR THESE REASONS FOR OPPOSING TODAY THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE DEPARTMENT FINANCE FILE. DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS. I'M JUST GONNA NOTE MR LOW -- I DIDN'T FIND THIS TO BE AT A COST TO THE STATE AND SO FOR THAT REASON IN THIS FISCAL COMMUNITY WE DID HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- I AM VOTING FOR IT TODAY I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THAT THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS AND PERHAPS BEFORE YOU TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR YOU MAY -- WANT TO AS HAVE THEM SHARE THOSE CONCERNS SO BUT FOR TODAY -- ON THE FISCAL QUESTION -- WE WILL GO AHEAD AND I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION NOW THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM.
