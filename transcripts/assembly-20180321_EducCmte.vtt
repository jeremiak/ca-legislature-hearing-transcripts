SO I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT

01:01:07.631 --> 01:01:10.600 region:rollup2
CREATING A STATE MANDATE WHICH

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.935 region:rollup2
STATE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR FOR

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.103 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT CONDUCT THAT. THAT

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:14.404 region:rollup2

01:01:20.544 --> 01:01:23.380 region:rollup2
WONDER IF YOU SHOULD BE TALKING

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.014 region:rollup2
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.582 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN THE STATE EDUCATION

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.216 region:rollup2
CAN

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:27.751 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AGAIN THEY COULD DO THIS

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:29.286 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:30.921 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IT'S NECESSARY TO

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:32.689 region:rollup2
CREATE A STATEWIDE MANDATE AND

01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:34.891 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.259 region:rollup2
CREATE A PROTECTED CLASS SO I I

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:36.860 region:rollup2
I SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE STRUGGLING

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.794 region:rollup2
THAT'S WE SEE THAT IN THE END

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.361 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:40.030 region:rollup2
SENATE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.664 region:rollup2

OF.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:55.045 region:rollup2
BECAUSE

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:56.146 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONNAIRES ARE DESIGNED

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:58.782 region:rollup2
BY THE PARTNER OF EDUCATION OF

01:01:56.146 --> 01:02:01.985 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IT WAS THOUGHT.

01:01:58.782 --> 01:02:03.920 region:rollup2
BY MY CONSTITUENTS THAT THAT'S

01:02:01.985 --> 01:02:07.490 region:rollup2
WHERE IT NEEDED TO GO.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.959 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S. THE RULING THERE. AS

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.894 region:rollup2
FAR AS PROTECTED CLASS NAT

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:12.996 region:rollup2
THAT'S A BATTLE FOR THEM TO WAGE

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:13.563 region:rollup2
AT SOME FUTURE TIME.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:08.491 region:rollup2
PUTTING A GUARD OR OFFICER IN

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.764 region:rollup2
PUTTING GUNS IN SCHOOLS IN THE

01:12:13.462 --> 01:12:16.065 region:rollup2

MORE SUBTLE.

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:23.372 region:rollup2
WE SAW THIS WITH THE INCIDENT

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:25.208 region:rollup2
MONTEREY LAST WEEK WHERE THREE

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:27.210 region:rollup2

POLICE OFFICER. ACCIDENTALLY

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:33.382 region:rollup2
DISCHARGING A GUN IN CLASS.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:34.584 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH PLACING A

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:36.252 region:rollup2
SECURITY GUARD A RESOURCE

01:12:34.584 --> 01:12:38.154 region:rollup2

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:41.591 region:rollup2
OF THAT PERSON'S GOT.

01:12:39.622 --> 01:12:43.092 region:rollup2
FOR MANY STUDENTS THE PRESENCE

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:44.160 region:rollup2
OF AN ARMED OFFICER MAKE SCHOOL

01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.595 region:rollup2
FEEL MORE LIKE A DETENTION

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.495 region:rollup2
CENTERS ON A SCHOOL.

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.564 region:rollup2
A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE SEEN AS

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:49.966 region:rollup2
SUSPECTS.

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:51.968 region:rollup2
SADLY ALL TOO OFTEN THAT FEELING

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:53.169 region:rollup2
IS REINFORCED WHEN OFFICERS ON

01:12:51.968 --> 01:12:54.270 region:rollup2
CAMPUS ARE BROUGHT INTO WHAT

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:56.339 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE ROUTINE SCHOOL

01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:57.607 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINARY MATTERS. ONLY TO

01:12:56.339 --> 01:12:59.342 region:rollup2
ESCALATE THE INCIDENT TO THE

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.842 region:rollup2
POINT SOMETIMES OF USING

01:12:59.342 --> 01:13:01.677 region:rollup2
EXCESSIVE FORCE AGAINST

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:02.878 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:04.480 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALL SEEN THE VIDEOS IN

01:13:02.878 --> 01:13:05.915 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:06.949 region:rollup2
STUDENTS PUSHED WERE THROWN TO

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.284 region:rollup2
THE GROUND BY OFFICERS IN THEIR

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:10.453 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

01:13:08.284 --> 01:13:11.487 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES WERE OFFENSES AS MINOR

01:13:10.453 --> 01:13:13.289 region:rollup2
AS FAILING TO PUT AWAY A CELL

01:13:11.487 --> 01:13:14.624 region:rollup2
PHONE.

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:16.459 region:rollup2
FOR THESE STUDENTS AND MANY

01:13:14.624 --> 01:13:17.627 region:rollup2
OTHERS THE PRESENCE OF A SCHOOL

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:18.494 region:rollup2
RESOURCE OFFICER FEELS LIKE A

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.162 region:rollup2
THREAT NOT A SOURCE OF

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:21.964 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:23.399 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR WAYS

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:24.667 region:rollup2
TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF POLICE

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.502 region:rollup2
IN OUR SCHOOLS NOT TO INCREASE

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.503 region:rollup2

SAFE.

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:32.675 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS INTO

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:34.410 region:rollup2
WELCOMING AN INCLUSIVE PLACES.

01:13:32.675 --> 01:13:35.711 region:rollup2
THAT SUPPORT THE SOCIAL AND

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.313 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:39.181 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY

01:13:37.313 --> 01:13:40.416 region:rollup2
NEED TO BUILD COMMUNITY AND

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:42.251 region:rollup2
ADDRESS CONFLICT WITH NON

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:44.186 region:rollup2
PUNITIVE METHODS.

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:45.655 region:rollup2
LET'S FOCUS ON PROVIDING STE

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.789 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WITH THOSE RESOURCES

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.957 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN INVESTING IN

01:13:46.789 --> 01:13:49.759 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE MEASURES THAT WILL

01:13:47.957 --> 01:13:51.360 region:rollup2

WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:10.266 region:rollup2
DISTURBING PROBLEM IN OUR

01:16:08.531 --> 01:16:11.600 region:rollup2

AND OTHER REMEDIES ART ALL THAT

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.771 region:rollup2
SIMPLE.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:17.973 region:rollup2
BUT ONE THING THAT I THINK IS TO

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:19.041 region:rollup2
SHOULD RESONATE VERY CLEARLY. AS

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:19.642 region:rollup2
IT IS NOT OKAY TO LEAVE ALL OF

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.444 region:rollup2
OUR CHILDREN.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:23.446 region:rollup2
DEFENSELESS.

01:16:21.444 --> 01:16:24.547 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE.

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:26.415 region:rollup2

LOCAL CONTROL.

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:37.560 region:rollup2

NOT OKAY TO LEAVE.

01:16:44.567 --> 01:16:49.071 region:rollup2

THIS ONE SHOULD RESONATE IN.

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2

FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS AS A

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:07.723 region:rollup2
THREAT.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:09.959 region:rollup2
TO THEM AS.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:11.861 region:rollup2

RECKLESS BEHAVIOR OR

YOUR APPROACH TO THIS

01:22:56.939 --> 01:22:59.041 region:rollup2
I DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN ELF

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.909 region:rollup2
IN THE ROOM THAT'S GOT TO GET

01:22:59.041 --> 01:23:01.944 region:rollup2

01:23:09.384 --> 01:23:13.889 region:rollup2

BEGIN WITH THE MEMBER I DO HAVE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:52.013 region:rollup2
A QUESTION FOR YOU SO. I I THINK

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:52.647 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S UP I THINK THE BELIEF

01:35:52.013 --> 01:35:52.814 region:rollup2
OF MANY OF US THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:35:52.647 --> 01:35:54.549 region:rollup2

01:35:52.814 --> 01:35:55.850 region:rollup2
PENALIZE BEING POOR THAT'S WHY

01:35:54.549 --> 01:35:57.385 region:rollup2
WE DID THAT YOU KNOW THAT

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:59.554 region:rollup2

ON AREAS SAN DIEGO.

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:06.961 region:rollup2
I THINK PROVIDERS POWERFUL

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:08.596 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THAT WE DON'T HAVE YOU

01:36:06.961 --> 01:36:09.864 region:rollup2
KNOW HARM PEOPLE CORRECTIVE FOR

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:11.1000 region:rollup2
FOR BEING POOR.

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:14.068 region:rollup2
BUT YEAH  <u><c.green>THAT THERE ARE</c></u>

01:36:11.1000 --> 01:36:15.336 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALS AND I KNOW WE'RE

01:36:14.068 --> 01:36:17.505 region:rollup2
STILL WORKING ON THIS WHERE.

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:18.606 region:rollup2
YET MAYBE INDIVIDUAL.

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:20.775 region:rollup2
THAT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO PAY

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:22.443 region:rollup2
THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AND

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:24.145 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY.

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:25.613 region:rollup2
A INCOME BRACKET WERE YOU KNOW

01:36:24.145 --> 01:36:27.248 region:rollup2
POVERTY RISES THAT MAYBE THERE

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:28.850 region:rollup2
ARE SOME OUT LIARS AND SO ARE

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:30.551 region:rollup2
THERE ANY EXAMPLES WHERE WE'RE

01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:31.819 region:rollup2
COLLECTION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:33.721 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY.

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:35.757 region:rollup2
FOR IT FOR A SCHOOL DISTRICT.

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:37.925 region:rollup2
INSIDE JUST WANT TO YOU KNOW

01:36:35.757 --> 01:36:39.227 region:rollup2
ASK YOU YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:41.896 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND AND I'VE HEARD

01:36:39.227 --> 01:36:44.432 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICALS ABOUT STUDENTS AND

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:46.534 region:rollup2
DRONES AND RICH AREAS IN PARENTS

01:36:44.432 --> 01:36:48.102 region:rollup2
NOT WANTING TO PAY FOR.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:49.370 region:rollup2
DRUMS WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW WERE

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:51.372 region:rollup2
BEING USED BY SCHOOLS.

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:53.374 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS AN AFTER SCHOOL

01:36:51.372 --> 01:36:54.876 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND AND.

01:36:53.374 --> 01:36:56.444 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE UNIQUE IN NOT

01:36:54.876 --> 01:36:56.644 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE WANT TO WORK ON.

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:58.446 region:rollup2
OFTEN.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.881 region:rollup2
.

01:36:58.446 --> 01:37:01.349 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES IT'S A THIRD PARTY

01:36:59.881 --> 01:37:03.951 region:rollup2
OPERATING THAT AFTER SCHOOL

01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:04.952 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND SO THE THIRD PARTY

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:06.054 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:07.388 region:rollup2
THE PARENT.

01:37:06.054 --> 01:37:08.489 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY CONTRACTUAL

01:37:07.388 --> 01:37:10.725 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP THAT THEY COULD

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:12.960 region:rollup2
STILL PURSUE. IF IT'S BEING DONE

01:37:10.725 --> 01:37:14.529 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE SCHOOL BY ALL MEANS

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:16.431 region:rollup2
A SCHOOL COULD AND IT'S AN AFTER

01:37:14.529 --> 01:37:18.499 region:rollup2
SCHOOL PROGRAM I I THINK WE DID

01:37:16.431 --> 01:37:20.101 region:rollup2
INTEND TO SAY THAT. THAT

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:22.437 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO OTHERWISE COULDN'T

01:37:20.101 --> 01:37:24.505 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR FOR FREE OR REDUCED

01:37:22.437 --> 01:37:26.007 region:rollup2
PRICES COULD CONTINUE TO ATTEND

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:26.874 region:rollup2
AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WITHOUT

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:28.843 region:rollup2
PAIN.

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:30.445 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE ARE USUALLY

01:37:28.843 --> 01:37:33.114 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED IN A WAY THAT YOU GET

01:37:30.445 --> 01:37:34.982 region:rollup2

01:37:33.114 --> 01:37:35.817 region:rollup2
TIME FRAME AND IF YOU.

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:37.118 region:rollup2

PAYING YOUR BILL COULD NOT

01:37:37.118 --> 01:37:41.756 region:rollup2
UTILIZE SOMETHING THAT IS EXTRA

01:37:39.854 --> 01:37:43.324 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE SCHOOL DAY. I'M SO I

01:37:41.756 --> 01:37:45.560 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER TOOLS

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:47.962 region:rollup2

STARTED THIS WITH WITH THE FACT

01:37:51.899 --> 01:37:53.968 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:55.970 region:rollup2
DEBT COLLECTORS WERE BEING USED

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:58.072 region:rollup2
AND FOUND OUT LATER BY A SCHOOL

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:59.841 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT THE THEY WERE

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:01.743 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GETTING BACK. AND THEY

01:37:59.841 --> 01:38:03.378 region:rollup2
WERE LOSING MONEY USING A DEBT

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:05.079 region:rollup2
COLLECTOR IT WAS THE THREAT OF

01:38:03.378 --> 01:38:07.648 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION AND IN MEANTIME

01:38:05.079 --> 01:38:08.616 region:rollup2
RUNNING PEOPLE'S CREDIT NAM. AND

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.984 region:rollup2
THOSE WERE MAINLY.

01:38:08.616 --> 01:38:11.686 region:rollup2
MIDDLE CLASS OR MIDDLE CLASS

DIFFERENT SITUATION.

01:38:18.826 --> 01:38:22.363 region:rollup2
SO I IF THERE'S SPECIFIC THINGS

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:23.765 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN RIDE INTO PROTECT.

01:38:22.363 --> 01:38:24.832 region:rollup2

WITH PARENTS IN A FINANCIAL

01:39:57.758 --> 01:40:00.494 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE THEY ARE NOT

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:02.196 region:rollup2

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.697 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

01:40:02.196 --> 01:40:06.167 region:rollup2

SITUATIONS CHANGE.

01:40:06.167 --> 01:40:08.402 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE BY SEEN

01:40:07.268 --> 01:40:09.804 region:rollup2
ASPECT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:11.606 region:rollup2
HERE WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT

01:40:09.804 --> 01:40:14.008 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE STAMP GREEN AYE AYE

OF THE DEBTS OF THEIR PARENTS.

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:21.015 region:rollup2
THERE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY

01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:22.583 region:rollup2
UNFAIR ABOUT THAT IT IS NOT THE

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:24.418 region:rollup2
CHILD'S FAULT WE SHOULD NOT

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:27.054 region:rollup2
PENALIZE A CHILD.

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:28.456 region:rollup2
FOR HAVING AYE IN SITUATIONS

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:29.056 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE THEIR PARENTS ARE

01:40:28.456 --> 01:40:30.725 region:rollup2
NOT POOR.

01:40:29.056 --> 01:40:32.493 region:rollup2
HAVING HAVING PARENTS WERE

01:40:30.725 --> 01:40:33.461 region:rollup2
UNWILLING TO PAY FOR SOMETHING

01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:35.229 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE

01:40:33.461 --> 01:40:36.430 region:rollup2
FREE. AND SO WE JUST WANT TO

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.298 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE CHILD IS LEFT

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.933 region:rollup2
HARMLESS.

01:40:37.298 --> 01:40:40.334 region:rollup2
IN ANY KIND OF SITUATION BY

01:40:38.933 --> 01:40:41.469 region:rollup2
WHICH THE PARENTS RESPONSIBLE

01:40:40.334 --> 01:40:42.637 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE ACCEPTED THE

01:40:41.469 --> 01:40:43.671 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT ON THINGS LIKE

01:40:42.637 --> 01:40:45.673 region:rollup2
VANDALIZE SCHOOL BOOKS RIGHT

01:40:43.671 --> 01:40:47.341 region:rollup2
THAT IS A SITUATION.

01:40:45.673 --> 01:40:48.576 region:rollup2
BY WHICH MOST OF THE TIME AT THE

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:49.677 region:rollup2
CHILD IS NOT THE PART OF THE

01:40:48.576 --> 01:40:52.947 region:rollup2
CHILD IS IN FACT.

01:40:49.677 --> 01:40:54.148 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO COSTS.

01:40:52.947 --> 01:40:54.482 region:rollup2
FOR THAT KIND OF THE THE OTHER

01:40:54.148 --> 01:40:56.384 region:rollup2
PART OF THE.

01:40:54.482 --> 01:40:57.685 region:rollup2
THE DECK

01:40:56.384 --> 01:41:00.288 region:rollup2
DO KNOWN PRACTICE WHAT WHAT

01:40:57.685 --> 01:41:01.522 region:rollup2
USUALLY HAPPENS HOW SCHOOLS ARE.

01:41:00.288 --> 01:41:02.123 region:rollup2
IS THAT ARE THEY ARE MOST THEN

01:41:01.522 --> 01:41:03.457 region:rollup2
USING THAT COLLECTORS ARE TO.

01:41:02.123 --> 01:41:05.159 region:rollup2
I HAVE

01:41:03.457 --> 01:41:06.294 region:rollup2
SO. WE FOUND WHEN WE FIRST

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:08.162 region:rollup2
STARTED THAT MOST WERE NOT USING

01:41:06.294 --> 01:41:08.863 region:rollup2
DEBT COLLECTORS IN AND SAN DIEGO

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:11.332 region:rollup2
WAS A.

01:41:08.863 --> 01:41:13.100 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND HAVE

01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:14.535 region:rollup2
SENT STANDING UPRIGHT HAS SINCE

01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:17.371 region:rollup2
STOPPED THAT PRACTICE.

01:41:14.535 --> 01:41:19.941 region:rollup2
HOWEVER I IN FURTHER REVIEW IN

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:21.409 region:rollup2
FACT MEETING WITH THE OPPONENTS

01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:23.244 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND THAT IN FACT

01:41:21.409 --> 01:41:24.979 region:rollup2
SOME RURAL SCHOOLS USE THAT KIND

01:41:23.244 --> 01:41:26.180 region:rollup2
OF CONTRACT WITH DEBT COLLECTORS

01:41:24.979 --> 01:41:27.315 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THEIR

01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:29.517 region:rollup2
NORMAL.

01:41:27.315 --> 01:41:31.385 region:rollup2
JUST COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:32.687 region:rollup2
RECEIVABLE SO THAT'S WHAT HE WAS

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:32.887 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HAVING TO DEAL

01:41:32.687 --> 01:41:34.989 region:rollup2
WITH.

01:41:32.887 --> 01:41:35.890 region:rollup2
TO USE A THIRD PARTY YOU

01:41:34.989 --> 01:41:38.092 region:rollup2
OUTSOURCE.

01:41:35.890 --> 01:41:39.560 region:rollup2
COLLECTING JUST LIKE THINGS

01:41:38.092 --> 01:41:41.162 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:42.396 region:rollup2
ARE RIGHTFULLY BEING CHARGED.

01:41:41.162 --> 01:41:43.764 region:rollup2
AND WE WON ENSURE.

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:45.299 region:rollup2
THAT THAT COULD BE DONE IN A

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:46.267 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THAT DOESN'T VIOLATE

01:41:45.299 --> 01:41:48.669 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:50.304 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO DOESN'T PUT PEOPLE'S.

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:51.639 region:rollup2
.

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:53.708 region:rollup2
CREDIT AT JEOPARDY.

01:41:51.639 --> 01:41:54.742 region:rollup2
CREDIT SCORE.

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.109 region:rollup2
I SEE SO THAT'S AN ALTERNATIVE

01:41:54.742 --> 01:41:57.345 region:rollup2
YOU'D ACTUALLY.

01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:58.713 region:rollup2
THE OPEN TO.

01:41:57.345 --> 01:42:00.381 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN DO IT WHERE DOESN'T

01:41:58.713 --> 01:42:02.016 region:rollup2
VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW WHERE SCHOOL

01:42:00.381 --> 01:42:03.618 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS SIMPLY.

01:42:02.016 --> 01:42:05.353 region:rollup2
I I HATE THAT THERE OUTSOURCING

01:42:03.618 --> 01:42:06.821 region:rollup2
BUT THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH A

01:42:05.353 --> 01:42:08.189 region:rollup2
THIRD PARTY IN ORDER TO DO KIND

01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:09.323 region:rollup2
OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT A

01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:10.825 region:rollup2
SCHOOL THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:11.125 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PREVENT SO WHAT THAT

01:42:10.825 --> 01:42:12.893 region:rollup2
OFTEN THAT.

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:15.930 region:rollup2
COPYRIGHT.

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:17.798 region:rollup2
WISE ONE OKAY AND OTHER NON.

01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:19.333 region:rollup2
THE ACTINS OF A DEBT WELL WHAT

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:20.501 region:rollup2
WAS HAPPENING IN SAN DIEGO WAS A

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:22.970 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL DEBT COLLECTION

01:42:20.501 --> 01:42:24.939 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHERE THEIR CONTRACT

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:26.507 region:rollup2
AFTER TRYING TO. RECEIVE THE

01:42:24.939 --> 01:42:27.708 region:rollup2

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:29.310 region:rollup2
THEY SENT IT TO A DEBT

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:30.378 region:rollup2
COLLECTOR I'VE SOLD IT FOR

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:32.646 region:rollup2
PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THEY IN

01:42:30.378 --> 01:42:32.847 region:rollup2
FACT LOST MONEY BY DOING THIS

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:35.816 region:rollup2
AND.

01:42:32.847 --> 01:42:36.250 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THE DEBT

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.486 region:rollup2
COLLECTORS WORKED.

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:40.054 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:42:38.486 --> 01:42:40.388 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANNA OFFEND ANYONE'S

01:42:40.054 --> 01:42:41.956 region:rollup2

01:42:40.388 --> 01:42:44.458 region:rollup2
.

01:42:41.956 --> 01:42:45.893 region:rollup2
I PURSUED THE DEBT.

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:48.095 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT'S TRADITIONAL LIKE

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:50.364 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER DEBT IN EVENTUALLY

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:52.233 region:rollup2
LEADING TO PEOPLE'S AYE CREDIT

SCORE BEING RENT.

01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:54.402 region:rollup2
SO YOU IT SEEMS LIKE THE CONCERN

IS WITH THE CREDIT MOSTLY ON AND

01:42:54.402 --> 01:42:57.204 region:rollup2
YOUR AND.

01:42:56.203 --> 01:42:59.073 region:rollup2

TO REGISTER OFFICIAL DEBT

01:42:59.073 --> 01:43:00.541 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY COLLECTING THAT'S MAYBE

01:43:01.809 --> 01:43:04.278 region:rollup2

HAPPENS I THINK IT'S SCHOOLS

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:24.131 region:rollup2
AND.

01:43:23.264 --> 01:43:25.1000 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE LARGE ENOUGH

POSITION THAT DOES THAT THAT

01:43:37.578 --> 01:43:40.581 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY.

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:41.248 region:rollup2
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE.

01:43:40.581 --> 01:43:42.983 region:rollup2
YEAH I GUESS SO I'M.

01:43:41.248 --> 01:43:44.018 region:rollup2

01:43:42.983 --> 01:43:45.453 region:rollup2
STILL A LITTLE UNCLEAR AND I YOU

01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:46.887 region:rollup2
KNOW.

01:43:45.453 --> 01:43:48.222 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE IS CATEGORICALLY

SOMETHING QUITE FRANKLY THAT I

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:18.152 region:rollup2
THINK WE'RE DOING A DISSERVICE

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:21.021 region:rollup2

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:29.263 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT DEBT WHEN IT GOES TO

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:32.500 region:rollup2
IMPACT YOUR CREDIT SCORE.

01:44:30.998 --> 01:44:33.934 region:rollup2

NOT THERE'S AN EXCEPTION BUT IT

01:44:33.934 --> 01:44:37.671 region:rollup2
WITH THAT IF YOU USE AN

THAT YOU TO CLOSE THE KIND OF

ASSOCIATION AND I WILL BE BRIEF.

01:48:27.167 --> 01:48:30.871 region:rollup2
WORLD LANGUAGE PROGRAMS PROVIDE

01:48:28.736 --> 01:48:32.006 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WITH LINGUISTIC AND

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:34.108 region:rollup2
INTERCULTURAL KNOWLEDGE SKILLS

01:48:32.006 --> 01:48:35.409 region:rollup2
AND PROFICIENCIES NECESSARY TO

01:48:34.108 --> 01:48:37.111 region:rollup2
INTERACT WITH SPEAKERS OF OTHER

01:48:35.409 --> 01:48:38.245 region:rollup2

01:48:37.111 --> 01:48:40.314 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THEIR READINESS FOR

01:48:38.245 --> 01:48:42.282 region:rollup2
LIFE WORK AND CITIZENSHIP IN OUR

01:48:40.314 --> 01:48:44.118 region:rollup2
DIVERSE EVOLVING AND

01:48:42.282 --> 01:48:45.252 region:rollup2
INTERCONNECTED SOCIETY. BUT IN

01:48:44.118 --> 01:48:46.720 region:rollup2
ED CODE AND OTHER OFFICIALS

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:47.955 region:rollup2
STATE DOCUMENTS THESE PROGRAMS

01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:50.124 region:rollup2
ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS WORLD

01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:51.859 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE BUT AS FOREIGN LANGUAGE

01:48:50.124 --> 01:48:53.026 region:rollup2
AND THIS POSES DIFFICULTIES ON

01:48:51.859 --> 01:48:54.695 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS FRONTS.

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:56.930 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE WORD FOREIGN

01:48:54.695 --> 01:48:58.399 region:rollup2
OFTEN HAS A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.933 region:rollup2
THAT SETS ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE OR

01:48:58.399 --> 01:49:01.535 region:rollup2
OBJECTS

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:04.204 region:rollup2
APART FROM OTHERS AS BEING

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:06.340 region:rollup2
STRANGE. ALIEN DIFFERENT AND

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:08.442 region:rollup2
UNFAMILIAR. AND THE FACT THAT

01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:10.310 region:rollup2
THESE FOUR TERMS ARE THE MOST

01:49:08.442 --> 01:49:11.612 region:rollup2
COMMON SYNONYMS OF THE WORD

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:13.414 region:rollup2
FOREIGN PROVIDES COMPELLING

01:49:11.612 --> 01:49:15.582 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE THAT CLASSIFYING THE

01:49:13.414 --> 01:49:17.651 region:rollup2
STUDY OF LANGUAGES AS FOREIGN.

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:19.520 region:rollup2
RISKS PROMOTING A CONNOTATION

01:49:17.651 --> 01:49:21.455 region:rollup2
THAT IS IN DIRECT CONTRAST TO

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:22.890 region:rollup2
THE UNIFYING WORK WE DO S. WORLD

01:49:21.455 --> 01:49:24.825 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE EDUCATORS.

01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:26.660 region:rollup2
AND TO THE DISTINCT VALUE THAT

01:49:24.825 --> 01:49:28.262 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S VAST LINGUISTIC AND

01:49:26.660 --> 01:49:33.233 region:rollup2

GLOBAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

01:49:33.801 --> 01:49:35.836 region:rollup2
AND IN FACT IN CALIFORNIA A

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:38.272 region:rollup2
STATE THAT IS RICH IN DIVERSITY

01:49:35.836 --> 01:49:39.540 region:rollup2
NO LANGUAGES TRULY FOREIGN.

01:49:38.272 --> 01:49:41.275 region:rollup2
CHANGING ALL REFERENCES IN AT

WORLD LANGUAGE SENDS A CLEAR

01:49:43.143 --> 01:49:46.180 region:rollup2
MESSAGE THAT OUR WEALTH OF

01:49:44.411 --> 01:49:48.215 region:rollup2
NATIVE AND ACQUIRED LANGUAGES

01:49:46.180 --> 01:49:49.616 region:rollup2
ARE AN ASSET. THAT SETS

01:49:48.215 --> 01:49:52.052 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA APART AND CERTAINLY

01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:53.220 region:rollup2
NOT A FOREIGN PHENOMENON IN OUR

01:49:52.052 --> 01:49:54.788 region:rollup2
LINGUISTIC AND CULTURALLY

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:57.558 region:rollup2
DIVERSE SOCIETY.

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:59.293 region:rollup2
IN FACT AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE

01:49:57.558 --> 01:50:01.361 region:rollup2
AND THE NUMEROUS NATIVE AMERICAN

01:49:59.293 --> 01:50:03.330 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN CALIFORNIA

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:05.833 region:rollup2
ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT FOREIGN. BUT

01:50:03.330 --> 01:50:08.469 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THESE TRULY AMERICAN

01:50:05.833 --> 01:50:10.471 region:rollup2

01:50:08.469 --> 01:50:12.039 region:rollup2

AFTER HOLDING SELECT COMMITTEES

02:51:13.230 --> 02:51:16.266 region:rollup2
THAT

02:51:14.064 --> 02:51:17.567 region:rollup2
THAT DATA NINETY EIGHT IS NINETY

02:51:16.266 --> 02:51:19.503 region:rollup2
EIGHT IS NINETY EIGHT PROBLEM IT

02:51:17.567 --> 02:51:21.338 region:rollup2
EIGHT AND SO. I THINK IN THE

02:51:19.503 --> 02:51:23.273 region:rollup2
ORIGINAL INTENT OF LC A FAST WE

02:51:21.338 --> 02:51:25.942 region:rollup2
EX WE HAD EXPECTED PEOPLE TO

02:51:23.273 --> 02:51:27.177 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN. THE SAME EFFORTS IN

02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:28.445 region:rollup2
THE SAME PROGRAMS THEY HAD

02:51:27.177 --> 02:51:29.713 region:rollup2
BEFORE.

02:51:28.445 --> 02:51:31.248 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY SCHOOLS DID

02:51:29.713 --> 02:51:32.983 region:rollup2
NOT DO THAT.

02:51:31.248 --> 02:51:34.451 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY TOOK THE CT MONEY

02:51:32.983 --> 02:51:35.986 region:rollup2
THAT WAS THERE PUT IT BACK INTO

02:51:34.451 --> 02:51:37.254 region:rollup2
THE BASE GRANT AND DIDN'T

02:51:35.986 --> 02:51:39.556 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY FEEL THE NEED TO

02:51:37.254 --> 02:51:40.957 region:rollup2
FUND. THE CT PROGRAMS.

02:51:39.556 --> 02:51:41.858 region:rollup2
AND SO I WANT TO SAY THAT

02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:43.527 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF FOR SOME STRANGE

02:51:41.858 --> 02:51:45.262 region:rollup2
REASON.

02:51:43.527 --> 02:51:47.564 region:rollup2
THE GRANTING PROCESS OF WHATEVER

02:51:45.262 --> 02:51:48.765 region:rollup2
HAPPENS HERE DOESN'T WORK OUT

02:51:47.564 --> 02:51:50.267 region:rollup2
THE WAY IT SHOULD AT SOME POINT

02:51:48.765 --> 02:51:52.602 region:rollup2
WITH FOLKS AFTER A PERIOD OF

02:51:50.267 --> 02:51:54.304 region:rollup2
TIME. ASISTIR STILL SHOULD HAVE

02:51:52.602 --> 02:51:54.838 region:rollup2
A COMMITMENT TO CT.

02:51:54.304 --> 02:51:56.339 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE MONEY IS STILL

02:51:54.838 --> 02:51:58.208 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:51:56.339 --> 02:51:59.809 region:rollup2
AND THE KIDS ARE STILL THERE AND

02:51:58.208 --> 02:52:01.912 region:rollup2
THE NEED IS STILL THERE.

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:03.847 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK WHEN WE DID THE

02:52:01.912 --> 02:52:05.615 region:rollup2
GRANT PROCESS SEVERAL YEARS AGO

02:52:03.847 --> 02:52:07.150 region:rollup2
BEFORE SOME OF YOU WERE HERE. WE

02:52:05.615 --> 02:52:08.919 region:rollup2
END UP DOING IT BECAUSE SCHOOLS

02:52:07.150 --> 02:52:11.321 region:rollup2
REMAINED ON DOING THE DISTRICTS

02:52:08.919 --> 02:52:12.856 region:rollup2
DID NOT DO CT. YET THE MONEY

02:52:11.321 --> 02:52:14.291 region:rollup2
THAT THE CATEGORICAL FUNDS THAT

02:52:12.856 --> 02:52:15.959 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN IN CT

02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:17.327 region:rollup2
WE'RE BASICALLY NOW PUT BACK

02:52:15.959 --> 02:52:18.862 region:rollup2
INTO EL CFF AND IT'S THE BASS

02:52:17.327 --> 02:52:19.863 region:rollup2
GRANT.

02:52:18.862 --> 02:52:21.464 region:rollup2
AND THE ASSUMPTION WAS THAT

02:52:19.863 --> 02:52:22.999 region:rollup2
THOSE THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE

02:52:21.464 --> 02:52:24.267 region:rollup2
IT AND SOME SCHOOLS DID AND SOME

02:52:22.999 --> 02:52:25.602 region:rollup2
DID NOT.

02:52:24.267 --> 02:52:27.571 region:rollup2
AND SO AS A RESULT THEY WE

02:52:25.602 --> 02:52:29.673 region:rollup2
CREATED THIS NEED THAT FOLKS

02:52:27.571 --> 02:52:31.374 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO BASICALLY DO CT AND WE

02:52:29.673 --> 02:52:32.375 region:rollup2
CREATED THIS QUIET PROCESS TO

02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:33.677 region:rollup2
KIND OF HELP KICK OFF THE

02:52:32.375 --> 02:52:35.178 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

02:52:33.677 --> 02:52:36.947 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:38.615 region:rollup2
THAT THE MONEY IS THERE IN

02:52:36.947 --> 02:52:41.318 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THERE IN THE LOCAL AND

02:52:38.615 --> 02:52:43.653 region:rollup2
IN THE BASS GRANT. AND LCF F. TO

02:52:41.318 --> 02:52:44.988 region:rollup2
DO C. T. BECAUSE IT WAS THERE

02:52:43.653 --> 02:52:46.756 region:rollup2
BEFORE THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

02:52:44.988 --> 02:52:48.792 region:rollup2
FORMULA AND ALL THAT MONIES PUT

02:52:46.756 --> 02:52:50.227 region:rollup2
PUT IN. SO OFTEN TIMES WHEN THE

02:52:48.792 --> 02:52:51.661 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR VETOED THESE BILLS.

02:52:50.227 --> 02:52:53.396 region:rollup2
HE'S VETOING BECAUSE HE KEEPS

02:52:51.661 --> 02:52:55.232 region:rollup2
SAYING OVER AND OVER I DON'T

02:52:53.396 --> 02:52:56.366 region:rollup2
WANT CATEGORICAL WHEELS DID

02:52:55.232 --> 02:52:57.934 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO COME BACK AGAIN.

02:52:56.366 --> 02:52:59.870 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE ALL THAT CATEGORICAL

02:52:57.934 --> 02:53:01.004 region:rollup2
MONEY WOULD BACK INTO IT SO I

02:52:59.870 --> 02:53:03.106 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN AS

02:53:01.004 --> 02:53:05.675 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS A COMMITMENT TO SEE T.

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:06.943 region:rollup2
E.. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE OUR

02:53:05.675 --> 02:53:08.478 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE ALL OF OUR KIDS

02:53:06.943 --> 02:53:10.413 region:rollup2

OF DEVELOPING COMPREHENSIVE

02:53:13.817 --> 02:53:17.520 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR ALL KIDS AND SO I

02:53:15.652 --> 02:53:19.956 region:rollup2
THINK WE DO THIS BUT IF FOR SOME

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:21.591 region:rollup2
STRANGE REASON. STUFF DISAPPEARS

02:53:19.956 --> 02:53:23.026 region:rollup2
A FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THE

02:53:21.591 --> 02:53:25.528 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR DOESN'T SIGN THIS. WE

02:53:23.026 --> 02:53:26.897 region:rollup2
AS A STATE AND U. S. DISTRICT

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:28.031 region:rollup2
