ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN HUNDRED BY SOMETHING MEMBER KALRA AND ACTUALLY TO DISCOVERY. MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THREE CHANGES TO EXISTING PITCHES MOTION PROCEDURES TO ENSURE GREATER ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS AND THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL FOR PERSONS CHARGED WITH CRIMES. AS A FORMER DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER I HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE CHALLENGE OF PURSUING A TIME NOT WAIVE JURY TRIAL OR MY CLIENT HAD THE WAY THEIR RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. AGAINST HIS OR HER RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. ASSEMBLY IN THIS BILL IT'S AN EFFORT TO BRING PITCHES MOTION TIMELINES TO ALIGNMENT WITH THE REGULAR CRIMINAL DISCOVERY NOTICE TIMELINES. AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED WOULD AMEND THE EVIDENCE CODE TO ALIGN THE TIME PERIOD OF PITCHES DISCOVERY MOTIONS WITH THE NOTICE PERIOD FOR DISCOVERY MOTIONS. IN CRIMINAL CASES FROM SIXTEEN DAYS TO TEN DAYS. THIS IS NOT ONLY BENEFIT DEFENSE ATTORNEYS BUT PROSECUTORS -- THE ACT BUT PROSECUTORS ENSURING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO USUALLY ACT AS THEIR LEAD WITNESSES DO NOT HAVE ANY HISTORY THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE THEIR SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION OF A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT. THIS BILL ALSO MAKES A NEEDED TECHNO CORRECTION OF THE CHANGES MADE IN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE FROM LAST YEAR BY ENSURING THAT COURTS MAY NOT ISSUE A PROTECTIVE ORDER. LIMITING THE USE OF RECORDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AVAILABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THIS POINT THIS LIMITS THE ABILITY TO IS TO PROTECT ORDER IF THE PUBLIC RECORDS WERE OBTAINED PROPERLY AND WITH THE WITH IN ACCORDANCE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. LASTLY TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY WOULD ALSO REPEAL RESTRICTIONS EXEMPTING SUPERVISING OFFICERS FROM THE DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS THROUGH A PITCHES MOTION FOR THEIR PRIOR MISCONDUCT WHEN IT IS PERTINENT TO A DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS WHICH MEANS. PART INTO THE FACTS OF THE CASE AT HAND NOT OPENING UP RECORDS FOR A FISHING EXPEDITION. IT WOULD ALSO -- FOR THE SAME PROTECTIONS ALONG FOR SOME BY SUBJECTING THE PITCHES MOTION FOR SUPERVISING OFFICER RECORDS THE SAME JUDICIAL SCRUTINY ALREADY REQUIRED UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT WILL BE LIMITED TO WHAT IS RELEVANT TO THE CASE AS DETERMINED BY THE JUDGE. BY MAKING THESE MODEST CHANGES CALIFORNIA TO MAKE PITCHES PROCEDURES LESS BURDENSOME AND TIME CONSUMING WHILE INCREASING FAIRNESS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. AND PROVIDING GREATER TRANSPARENCY -- I WAS JUST LAST WEEK BUT WITH THIS BILL ALREADY ON THE THIRD READING FILE. WE RECEIVE LATE OPPOSITION FROM LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE -- BUT GUARDING JUST THE LAST PROVISIONS THE LEAGUE DOES NOT HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- WE ARE IN EARNEST TALKS WITH THE PLEASE PROUDLY IN NEARING DOES NARROWING AND CLARIFYING THE SCOPE ABOUT THIRD ITEM WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS THIS BILL GOES THE SENATE. AND HAVE COMMITMENTS BUT TO TAKE APART A TAKE ON APPROPRIATE MOMENTS -- TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL IS A PROBABLY NARROWED IN ITS FIRST SENATE COMMITTEE. BUT THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AIBO. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA. IS CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TO URGENT AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE BROUGHT FORWARD BY OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE. I WANT TO OFFER A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE FROM SOMEBODY THAT HAS -- JOINT PITCHES MOTIONS AS A PROSECUTOR AND ALSO MADE PITCHES MOTIONS DEFENDING PEOPLE THERE'S NOTHING MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO A SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT. TO A JURY TRIAL INTO DUE PROCESS THEN THE ABILITY TO CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AND THIS IS IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR DEFENSE THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR PROSECUTION BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU. AS A DEPUTY A THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS CARRY A CASE FOR TO A JURY. NOT KNOWING WHETHER YOU'RE GOING TO PUT A POLICE OFFICER ON THE STAND HAS IMPEACHMENT MATERIAL IN THERE FILE THAT YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN ACCESS. TO THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO SHORTEN THE TIME FRAME FOR PITCH IS TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH DEFENSE AND PROSECUTION GETS THOSE RECORDS IN A TIMELY FASHION. IT'S CONSISTENT WITH DUE PROCESS I KNOW A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES ON OUR SIDE OF THE AISLE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THIS BILL -- BUT I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE I THINK IT'S A GOOD CHANGE IN LAW AND I HAVE A COMMITMENT FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE TO NARROW THE THIRD PORTION OF IT IN THE SENATE. AND CLEAR UP SOME ISSUES THAT I THINK -- WILL REMOVE OPPOSITION FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CUNNINGHAM SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CARL YOU MAKE CLOTHES IF YOU WISH. THANK YOU MISTER NICE WANT THINK A COLLEGE OF SCIENCE A MISSILE FROM BRINGING BACK PERSPECTIVE BOTH AS A PROSECUTOR AND A DEFENSE ATTORNEY AS YOU INDICATED -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOUGHT.

ASSEMBLY BILL THREE THIRTY BY SOMETHING MEMBER GABRIEL AND OTHERS AND I PLAN TO COURTS. MR GABRIEL. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB THREE THIRTY WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SARGENT SHRIVER CIVIL COUNCIL PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE VITAL LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS IN LIFE CHANGING CIVIL LEGAL MATTERS. AND I'VE ALSO BEEN PROVEN TO HELP IMPROVE OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL RELEASED A RIGOROUS EVALUATION WHICH FOUND THAT SHRIVER PROGRAMS NOT ONLY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR LITIGANTS. BUT THAT THEY ALSO INCREASE SETTLEMENTS REDUCE COST TO THE COURT SYSTEM AND PROVIDED NUMEROUS OTHER EFFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS. THE SHRIVER PROGRAM WAS CREATED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. AND IT WOULD SEND A POWERFUL MESSAGE TO EXPAND THIS PROGRAM WITH THE SAME BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. INVESTING IN THIS WHERE THE PROGRAM WILL BRING JUSTICE TO MORE CALIFORNIANS IN MORE PARTS OF THE STATE'S. AND EXPAND SERVICES TO CRITICAL AREAS SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THANK YOU AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THINGS GABRIEL YES MISS CUNNINGHAM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. ALL RIGHTS ARE JUST BEGINNING COLLEAGUES IF YOU GO. TO A NUMBER OF COURT ROOMS IN FAMILY COURT ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ON ANY GIVEN DAY YOU WILL SEE A LINE OF PEOPLE. THAT ARE SELF REPRESENTED AND TRYING TO WORK THROUGH SERIOUS DISPUTES INVOLVING THEIR CHILDREN -- AND IT IS A COMBINATION OF TRAGEDY AND COMEDY TO WATCH THAT -- THIS PROGRAM RAISES A FEW NOMINAL FEES BY NOMINAL AMOUNT. AND IT FUNDS REPRESENTATION FOR THOSE PEOPLE. WHICH FREES UP OUR COURT SYSTEM. IS BETTER FOR CHILDREN IN THE LONG RUN AND ALLOWS THEM ACCESS TO COUNSEL THAT CAN HELP RESOLVE THEIR DISPUTES THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE ON THEIR OWN -- I URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THEY WAS CUNNINGHAM MISTER MALONE HERE RIGHT NOW I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO ADD TO THAT -- I'VE SEEN THIS PROGRAM IN ACTION IT'S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S A GOOD EXPENDITURE. OF MONEY IT'S IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE ONLY PLACE WE CAN FIND IT IS THROUGHA SMALL INCREASE IN FEES THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE REALLY NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT AS WE GO FORWARD BECAUSE FEES GO UP AND UP AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE JUSTICE. SYSTEM IS -- RESULT OF THAT -- BUT AS FOR THIS BILL I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE IT'S A IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. THANK YOU MUCH BLOOM SAYING NO DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

TODAY SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO EXPERIENCE MISCONDUCT AT THE HANDS OF THEIR EMPLOYER. ARE ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE OR PURSUE A CLAIM UNDER PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS PAGO. THESE EXISTING OPTIONS ARE OFTEN INEFFECTIVE REMEDIES THAT CAN TAKE MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS TO PROCESS OR RESULT IN THE SURVIVOR RECEIVING A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CIVIL PENALTIES. RECOVERED FOR LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS A RECENT STUDY FOUND HAVING BEEN FIRED OR FEARING TERMINATION. BECAUSE OF THEIR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION AND 34% REPORT HAVING TO QUIT A JOB.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT HR THIRTY ONE WHICH RECOGNIZE THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF HARVEY BERNARD MILK. HOW THE MILK WAS BORN ON MAY TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN THIRTY AND WOOD NEAR NEW YORK? PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER MODERN FIGURE HARVEY MILK'S LIFE AND POLITICAL CAREER EMBODY THE RISE OF THE LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE NATION AND AROUND OUR WORLD. HARVEY MILK MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO WITH HIS PARTNER SCOTT SMITH. ANDHE OPENED HIS NOW FAMOUS CAMERA SHOP IN THE ON CASTRO STREET IN THE HEART OF THE CITY'S BLOSSOMING GAY DISTRICT. SOON BECAME A COMMUNITY LEADER FOUND IN THE CASTRO VALLEY ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL MERCHANTS. MILK RAN SEVERAL TIMES FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL UNTIL HE WAS ELECTED TO REPRESENT DISTRICT FIVE ON THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. MILK WAS ONE OF THE FIRST OPENLY GAY POLITICIANS TO HOLD PUBLIC OFFICE WHEN HE WAS ELECTED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN LOOK WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEFEAT OF PROPOSITION SIX CALMLY KNOWN AS THE BRIGGS INITIATIVE IN NOVEMBER OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I AM VERY ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT THE FOLKS IN THIS STATE WERE ASKED WHETHER OR NOT. WE SHOULD HIRE A BAN GAYS AND LESBIANS FROM BEING PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS THAT WAS ON THE BALLOT IN HARVEY HELPED LEAD THE FIGHT TO DEFEAT IT WHICH THE VOTERS DID. HARVEY MONK'S LIFE WAS CUT SHORT AS MANY OF YOU WELL KNOW. HE WAS ASSASSINATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ALONG SIDE THEN SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR GEORGE MOSCONI. BY A FORMER COLLEAGUE DAN WHITE. HARVEY MILK WAS JUST FORTY EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE WAS KILLED. ARE YOU LOOKS KILLER SADLY RECEIVED A VERY LENIENT SENTENCE SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW THAT DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF A TAPED CONFESSION HE WAS ONLY CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER IN ONLY SERVE FIVE YEARS IN PRISON. MAY BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE HOMOPHOBIA IT WAS SO COMMON IN THOSE DAYS. ARE YOU LOOK IS CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THOSE INFLUENTIAL POLITICIANS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY DESPITE HAVING ONLY SERVED IN PUBLIC OFFICE FOR A BIT OF A BIT LESS THAN A YEAR. THERE ARE NUMEROUS INSTITUTIONS AND SCHOOLS IN THIS STATE AND ACROSS THIS COUNTRY THAT BEAR HARVEY MILK'S NAME A TESTAMENT TO HIS CONTRIBUTIONS. HARVEY MILK WAS STATIONED IN SAN DIEGO. AS A NAVY DIVING INSTRUCTOR IN. NINETEEN FIFTY FOUR AND TWENTY TWELVE SAN DIEGO BECAME THE FIRST CITY IN UNITED STATES TO HONOR MILK WITH THE STREET. WITH HIS VERY OWN NAME. MEMBERS ARE PROUD TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT TODAY WE ARE BUILDING THE U. S. AND S. HARVEY MILK. IN THE SHIPYARDS IN SAN DIEGO THAT SHIP IS EXPECTED TO BE COMMISSIONED IN JUST A FEW YEARS FROM NOW.

AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION CALIFORNIA LOST ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE END OF REDEVELOPMENT. WHILE WE HAVE MOVED A NUMBER OF NEW POLICIES IN RECENT YEARS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS INCLUDING FUNDING. WE NEED MORE RESOURCES TO BUILD THE ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOMES FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY GIVEN OUR HOMES AS CRISIS ON OUR STREETS.

WHY IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY? FORTY AND IN THE BOTTOM TENTH IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING. AB THIRTY NINE PROPOSES A ROAD MAP FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET TO WHERE WE USED TO BE IN THE TOP TEN IN THE NATION. IN PER PEOPLE K. THROUGH TWELVE FUNDING. THIS IS A BILL THAT SUPPORTED BY ALL EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS THE PTA TEACHERS SCHOOL BOARDS SCHOOL THIS IS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS I ASKED FOR A AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M ALSO A JOINT AUTHORED THIS MEASURE AND THIS MORNING WE ADOPTED OUR BUDGET FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THE GOOD NEWS WILL HAVE ABOUT THREE BILLION IN NEW MONEY. FOR OUR SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE BAD NEWS IS A WERE STILL FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL FUNDING. IT'S REALLY A DISGRACE ALL HOW LOW WE FALLEN. FRANKLY SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND PROP THIRTEEN THE STATE IF YOU LOOK AT THE HIGH. HI. FUNDED SCHOOLS ACROSS OUR NATION. NEW YORK ILLINOIS MASSACHUSETTS THEY ALL HAVE ABOUT THE SAME IN STATE FUNDING IS THE LOCAL FUNDING WHICH EVAPORATED OF COURSE THAT GOES BACK. TO PROP THIRTEEN SO IS ONLY TWO WAYS YOU CAN GO ABOUT FIXING THIS ISSUE CALIFORNIA FRANKLY SHOULD BE NUMBER. ONE THAT WOULD BE ABOUT FORTY FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS I'M NOT SURE WE CAN GET THERE OVERNIGHT BUT WE SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE WE SHOULD BE TWENTY FIVE WE SHOULD BE THE TOP HALF WE LEAD IN. ENVIRONMENT HEALTH CARE A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE SO MANY OTHER ISSUES BUT NOT AND FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE BASICS OF OUR STATE. SO TO GET THERE WHAT YOU COULD DO TWO THINGS YOU COULD INCREASE REVENUES OR YOU CAN RE PRIORITIZE OTHER STATE PROGRAMS REALLY ONLY TWO OPTIONS. SO TO GET TO THE MIDDLE. WOULD BE ROUGHLY TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT WOULD HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE UC CSU SYSTEM EVERY CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM AND EVERY STATE PARK. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT. THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH HERE SO REALLY IT'S ABOUT US GOING TO THE VOTERSOF CALIFORNIANS SAYING ARE YOU OKAY BEING FORTY FIRST. IS IF YOU'RE NOT THERE REALLY ARE LIMITED OPTIONS AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE FIND OUR FUTURE THAT'S OUR SCHOOLS IN THIS DOES IT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT JUST MONEY AS A MONEY PER SE BUT THIS IN THIS IMPACTS SCHOOL CLASS SIZE. MAKE SURE WE CAN PAY OUR TEACHERS LIVING WAGES SO THEY CAN LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY WORK. MAKING SURE WE CAN HAVE THESE ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS LIKE ARTS AND MATH IN SPORTS AND COUNSELORS IN SCHOOL NURSES AND THE BASICS IN OUR CLASSROOMS WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TODAY.

GRADUATING READING TEST SCORES FORTY SEVENTH EIGHTH AND GRADUATING MATH TEST SCORES AND IN TERMS OF OF TEACHER TO STUDENT RATIO WE WERE DEAD LAST. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. I THINK IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT WE ARE FAILING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO K. TWELVE EDUCATION. DOWN. TO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT IS THAT WE ARE FORTY FIRST. IN TERMS OF PER PUPIL SPENDING. THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED IT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED IMMEDIATELY THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST WITH RESPECT YOUR AYE AYE. HEY WE TRY THAT AGAIN RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS EXCELLENT BILL.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTY ONE BY SOMETHING MEMBER GONZALEZ AND ACTUALLY TO EMPLOYMENT. THIS IS ALICE YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. OUR LEGISLATURE IN OUR STATE HAS PASSED IN THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY AGAIN SEXUAL HARASSMENT PAY INEQUITY DISCRIMINATION WAGE THAT. AND OTHER AGREE JUST LABOR VIOLATIONS. BUT THESE LAWS ARE COMPLETELY WORTHLESS IF THEY CAN'T BE ENFORCED IN COURT OR BY STATE AGENCIES BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER HAS FORCED THEIR WORKERS TO SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS. IN AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN OR KEEP THEIR JOB. MANDATING THAT EMPLOYERS. EMPLOYEES USE ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE CLAIMS ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO FORCE THEIR WORKERS INTO SECRETIVE HEARINGS WHICH HIGH LABOR VIOLATIONS FROM THE PUBLIC. PROTECT SERIAL ABUSERS AND ULTIMATELY SILENCES VICTIMS. SINCE THE RISE OF THE ME TOO MOVEMENT WE'VE CONTINUE TO SEE WORKERS HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION ON THE JOB SPEAK UP AND SPEAK OUT AGAINST US AND JUST PRACTICE FORCED ARBITRATION. THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION EARLIER THIS YEAR WE SAW GOOGLE WORKERS REFUSE TO ACCEPT BINDING ARBITRATION AS A CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT. BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE LEVERAGE IN ACCESS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET GOOGLE TO CHANGE THEIR POLICIES UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE WORKERS WORKING AT LOW WAGE JOBS YOU DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING DON'T HAVE THIS KIND OF LEVERAGE. ARBITRATION CAN BE A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ESPECIALLY WHEN BOTH PARTIES FREELY AND HAVE EQUAL. ENTER INTO IT FREELY INVOLUNTARILY AND HAVE EQUAL BARGAINING POWER. IT'S FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL WHEN ONE PRAYS ABILITY TO EARN A LIVING DEPENDS ON SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO WAIVE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHTS. AB FIFTY ONE IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO SIMPLY REQUIRE THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE TO SIGN SUCH AGREEMENTS WITHOUT THE THREAT OF JOB LOSS OR RETALIATION. IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT EMPLOYERS FROM USING ARBITRATION OR ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS TO RESOLVE WORKPLACE DISPUTES AS LONG AS A WORKER AGREES. THIS BILL EXPRESSLY STATES THAT IT'S NOT INTENDED TO INVALIDATE ANY EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. OTHERWISE ENFORCEABLE BY LAW OR TO APPLY TO POST DISPUTE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS IN NEGOTIATED SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS THE BOTTOM LINE IS ALL CONTRACTS MUST BE VOLUNTARY NOT THE RESULT OF COERCION. MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTE ON THIS BILL ASHER AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL DO THE SAME THIS YEAR I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS GONZALES SAYING. NO DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM.

IT THE COMMERCIAL MARKET MOVES TO A MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL I CAN TELL YOU THAT LOOK CAREFULLY AT THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THIS I REMAIN UNCONVINCED THAT THE LIMITED NUMBER OF PATIENTS RECEIVING. ASSISTANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM WILL FUNDAMENTALLY DISRUPT THE PATIENT CARE THE PATIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVE. MANY OF YOU MAY BE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS APPROACH WHICH FIXES A REIMBURSEMENT I UNDERSTAND THAT DISCOMFORT BUT I'M CONVINCED THAT THE MARKET DOMINATION BY TWO LARGE COMPANIES. HAS MADE COMPETITION VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT ALLOW THESE COMPANIES TO DEMAND REIMBURSEMENT THAT IS FIVE TIMES HIGHER THE MEDICARE RATE AN EVEN HIGHER. WHEN THE MARKET DOESN'T FUNCTION COMPETITIVELY IN FOR PROFIT COMPANIES EXPLOIT THE DOM THEIR DOMINANCE FOR EXCESSIVE PROFIT MARGINS IT'S TIME TO PRESS THE INTERVIEWING WE ALL END UP PAYING?

THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS FROM OVER PRICED INEFFECTIVE CAREER TRAINING PROGRAMS BY REINSTATING A VERSION OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE. RECENTLY SCRAPPED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. THIS RULE WAS IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THE ALL TOO COMMON STORY OF STUDENTS PROMISED BY RECRUITERS THAT THEY WILL FIND A JOB IN AN INDUSTRY. WHO TAKE OUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN DEBT? ONLY TO FIND UPON GRADUATION THAT THEY CAN'T GET ANY OF THE PROMISED JOBS THEY'RE UNEMPLOYED AND FACE ASTRONOMICAL DEBT REPAYMENT OR EVEN LOAN DEFAULT. THE FEDERAL GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE APPLIES TO CREW TRAINING PROGRAMS A TOOK ADVANTAGE OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. UNDER THE RULE A PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T PASS MUSTER FOR MORE THAN HALF OF ITS GRADUATES. WHO HAD STUDENT EXCESSIVE STUDENT LOAN BURNS WHEN WEIGHED AGAINST THEIR INCOMES AFTER COLLEGE WOULD FAIL? BASED ON INITIAL DATA FROM THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA DID NOT PASS THIS TEST. THOUGH SHODDY PROGRAMS GRADUATED OVER FIFTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO LEFT SCHOOL WITH ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT DEBT. LAST YEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP MOVE TO SCRAP THE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT RULE WITHOUT THE RULE BAD PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO PREY UPON OUR STUDENTS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.

ASSEMBLY BILL TEN SIXTY SIX BY SOMETHING MEMBER GONZALEZ AND ACTUALLY TO UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION MAKING APPROPRIATION THERE. FOR IT'S GONZALEZ THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. WE PROVIDE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT ITS HEYDAY WAS DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION BECAUSE WE REALIZE WHEN PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OUT OF WORK. IT AFFECTS NOT ONLY THEIR LIVELIHOOD BUT THE LIVELIHOOD OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN A COMMUNITY OF THEIR CHILDREN. IT IT IT IT SHOULD IT ACTUALLY CAN CAUSE -- WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UNEMPLOYED AND THEY HAVE NO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IT COULD CAUSE HOPE HOMELESSNESS PEOPLE? RUIN THEIR CREDIT AND YET IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME RULES AROUND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WHEN IT COMES TO LABOR DISPUTES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS CLEAR. I WE SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE LOCKED OUT AS AN EMPLOYEE YOU GET. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOMETIMES IN THE PAST YOU HAVEN'T. STRIKING WORKERS HAVE NOT HAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS BILL IS TRYING TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD INSANE IF YOU'RE LOCKED OUT FROM YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU CAN GET AN EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AFTER ONE WEEK? IF YOU'RE ON STRIKE WITH YOUR EMPLOYER YOU CAN FILE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AFTER FOUR WEEKS. MEMBERS I'D ASK YOU TO THINK WHAT IT BE LIKE TO BE ON STRIKE FOR FOUR WEEKS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WORKERS DO. EASILY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT TO DEAL IN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR A REDUCED PAYMENT TO STAY OUT ON STRIKE OVER FOUR WEEKS IT'S VERY RARE THAT WE HAVE THESE KINDS OF STRIKES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ONCE IN AWHILE WE DO. AND WHEN WE DO MASS DEVASTATION HAPPENS TO THOSE FAMILIES AND TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. THIS IS A VERY BAD I THINK COMPROMISED BILL I WORKED HARD WITH THE CHAIR OF INSURANCE TO MAKE SURE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD PUT BRING FORWARD. BUT THIS HELPS TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AND IF YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT LARGE CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER AND LEVERAGE DURING LABOR WORKERS. HAVE TOO MUCH INCENTIVE. IN A LABOR DISPUTE TO STAY ON STRIKE THEN DON'T WORK. FOR DON'T VOTE. FOR IF YOU CARE ABOUT WORKERS AND YOU THINK THAT MIDDLE CLASS WORKERS AND LOW INCOME WORKERS MIGHTNEED A LITTLE BIT OF LEVELING I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ MR DAILY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. IT WILL HELP MAKE THE RIGHT TO STRIKE A REALITY FOR LOWER INCOME WORKERS BY EASING THE FINANCIAL PAIN OF A LONG LABOR DISPUTE. VERY FEW WORKERS WILL EVER BE ON STRIKE FOR MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS. AND THEN BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS UNDER THIS BILL AS I SAID VERY VERY FEW WORKERS. WOULD EVER. WANT TO BE ON STRIKE FOR MORE THAN FOUR WEEKS. BUT FOR THE WORKERS WHO FEEL COMPELLED TO TAKE THE STEP OF GOING ON STRIKE THE DIFFICULT STEP. THIS BENEFIT MAY WELL ALLOW THEM TO LEAST FEED THEIR FAMILIES. OR PAY THEIR BILLS.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN OH FIVE BY SOME THE MEMBER O'DONNELL AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY CHARTER SCHOOLS. MR O'DONNELL THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SEEKS TO REFORM THE CHARTER SCHOOL AUTHORIZATION. APPEALS. IN RENEWAL PROCESSES. NOW I SHOULD NOTE IF YOU WANT TO CLOSE EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS BILL IS NOT FOR YOU. IF YOU WANT TO REVISIT THE AUTHORIZATION AND RENEWAL PROCESS FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS THIS BILL IS FOR YOU. BUT AGAIN THIS BILL IN OF ITSELF WILL NOT CLOSE ANY CHARTER SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT I HAVE COMMITTED TO TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE TO FURTHER REFINE THE CHARTER APPEAL PROCESS AGAIN THIS BILL WILL BE AMENDED. I HAVE ALSO COMMITTED TO TAKING A MEMBERS TO CLARIFY THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS ON TRIBAL LAND WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN APPEAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE. UNIQUE SITUATIONS. THERE ARE WEAKNESSES IN CURRENT LAW WHICH ARE HURTING OUR STUDENTS AND WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION. IT IS THE DUTY OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ACTION. CURRENT LAW ALLOWS THOSE SEEKING TO OPEN A CHARTER SCHOOL TO GO AUTHORIZES. SIMPLY PUT THIS MEANS THAT AFTER BEING REJECTED BY ONE BOARD. THEY CAN GO SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER BOARD FOR FOR APPROVAL OFTEN FAR FROM HOME. THIS CAN RESULT IN OVERSIGHT BY A BODY THAT IS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. A LACK OF LOCAL OVERSIGHT CAN LEAD TO POOR FISCAL MANAGEMENT AND CERTAINLY. POOR STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS BILL SEEKS TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO CONSIDER FISCAL ACADEMIC OR FACILITY IMPACT THAT A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL MAY HAVE. ON A NEIGHBORHOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL THAT'S A NEW CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S NOT A RE AUTHORIZED CHARTER SCHOOL THAT'S NOT WHEN IT'S EVEN EXISTENCE TODAY. DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONSIDER FISCAL IMPACT FOR EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WILL NOT. BE PART OF THE RE AUTHORIZATION PRESENT PROCESS. ONCE THE CHARTER COMES BACK FOR RENEWAL AUTHORIZES WILL CONSIDER THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ITSELF. THIS WILL ALLOW THE AUTHORIZED OR TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO A PROBLEM BEFORE IT BECOMES AN EMERGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE ONE SCHOOL WAS DENIED BY BOTH THE DISTRICT AND THE COUNTY AND WAS APPROVED BY THE STATE. BUT CLOSED DUE TO FISCAL MANAGEMENT. PARENTS WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE SCHOOL WAS CLOSING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THIS SCHOOL CLOSURE LESS STUDENTS STRANDED AND UNDER THIS BILL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN WARNINGS. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES ALL TEACHERS IN CHARTER SCHOOLS TO HOLD REQUIRED CREDENTIAL. FOR THEIR TEACHING ASSIGNMENT. FINALLY THE BILL ALLOWS CHARTER STREE SO TO RECEIVE HELP WHEN THEY'E STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY. AND ONCE AGAIN THIS BILL WILL NOT CLOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND I SHOULD NOTE THAT WHEN THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION STATS WORK IS COMPLETE WE WILL CONTINUE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH ALL PARTIES. AND I WANT TO STRESS ALL PARTIES ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THE S. P. I. AS URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE FORWARD DO NOT WAIT FOR HIS TASK FORCE BUT CERTAINLY WE WILL CONTEMPLATE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AS WE SHOULD. CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO PROTECT ALL STUDENTS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK. THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL MISTER MERCH SUSHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY TORN WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND I I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE CREATING FINANCIAL FISCAL CHALLENGES FOR DISTRICTS. MANY OF OUR LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS. I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE I I I I WANT TO SUPPORT ANY MEASURE THAT. WILL CRACK DOWN ON BAD CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY BAD CHARTER SCHOOLS OUT THERE. AND THAT WE SHOULD SHUT THEM DOWN [inaudible] MY CONCERN. IS THAT THIS BILL MAY RISK SHUTTING DOWN [inaudible] GOOD. EXISTING CHARTER SCHOOLS AND I ALTHOUGH. THE AUTHOR [inaudible] STATED THAT. THIS WILL NOT. YOU KNOW I WENT OVER A SPECIFIC PROVISION AND THE BILL. SECTION FOUR SEVEN SIX OH FIVE SUBDIVISIONS J. [inaudible] THAT LIMITS. THE APPEAL PROCESS [inaudible] FOR ANY ADVERSE DECISION BY THE GOVERNING AUTHORITY TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION TO BE LIMITED ONLY TO PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS. SO IN OTHER WORDS. IF A GOOD CHARTER SCHOOL. IS PERFORMING WELL ACADEMICALLY IS IS IS PRODUCING BE. ACADEMIC RESULTS AND YET. IS SHUT DOWN. FOR POLITICAL OR OTHER REASONS THAT MAY BE ON SPECIFIED. THEY WOULD HAVE NO RIGHT TO AN APPEAL. IF IT WAS NOT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PROCEDURAL VIOLATION THAT'S THE FIGHT IN THE BILL SO. I HAVE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR WITHOUT OBJECTION. WELL THE AUTHOR COMMIT THAT WILL ENSURE THAT GOOD CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE PRODUCING. GOOD ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. WE'LL HAVE A RIGHT TO APPEAL TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. MR O'DONNELL. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WELL WHAT I'VE ALREADY SAID IS THIS BILL IS HALF DONE BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS WE HAVE THE S. P. EYES COMMITTEE COMMISSION OUT THEIR TASK FORCE I GUESS IS WHAT THEY CALL IT. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A REAL AUTHORIZATION PROCESS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY. THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE RIGHT TUNING IN AGAIN -- IT AND I COULD JUST MISTER SPEAKER AND THAT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER CLARIFIED I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IS A POINT OF CONTENTION FOR MANY. AND I AM COMMITTING TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT AND AMENDING THE BILL FURTHER. MISTER SPEAKER MISTER MURATSUCHI IF I MAY I FIND THAT RESPONSE INSUFFICIENT. YOU KNOW THIS IS. I I I I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS A YOU KNOW. OBVIOUSLY VERY COMPLICATED AND VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE. AND ON TOP OF THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A TASK FORCE THAT IS. PREPARING TO ISSUE THE RECOMMENDATIONS. IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO COMMIT TODAY RIGHT NOW THAT HE WILL. AMEND THE BILL TO INSURE THAT GOOD CHARTER SCHOOLS PRODUCING GOOD ACADEMIC. RESULTS WILL NOT BE SHUT DOWN THEN I WILL BE WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI. MR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH FIVE AS A PROUD. JOINT AUTHOR OF THE MEASURE. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ACT HAS LARGELY BEEN UNTOUCHED SINCE IT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE. THAT WE NAILED IT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS AGO THAT WE GOT IT EXACTLY RIGHT IT IS CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE. TO REVIEW. MODERNIZE AND IMPROVE THE LAW TO LOOK AT OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES PLUS IDENTIFY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND ADJUST ACCORDINGLY THIS BILL. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL CONTROL LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS ARE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BY AND ARE ACCOUNTABLE. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY ARE ENTRUSTED TO MAKE FINAL DECISIONS ABOUT THE EDUCATION OF THE STUDENTS LIVING WITHIN THE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND TO DO WHAT IS BEST. FOR STUDENTS PARENTS TEACHERS OTHER SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT CLOSING CHARTER SCHOOLS IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE'RE PROVIDING A QUALITY EDUCATION. TO OUR STUDENTS AND DOING WHAT'S BEST FOR THE DISTRICT AND THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE AYE VOTE ON AB. FIFTY TO FIVE THANK RESPOND TO MR PATERSON NEW YORK MEMBERS A SPEAKER THANK GOD RISE -- YEAH Là RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION HERE -- THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL CHARTER SCHOOL IN FRESNO CHARTERED BY FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IS AN ABSOLUTELY AWARD WINNING CHARTER SCHOOL. AND YET BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL IN WORKINGS. OF THE FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD AND A RECENT ELECTION. THE FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL BOARD. A FEW MEMBERS ATTEMPTED. AND WE'RE GAINING SOME TRACTION. TO SIMPLY DE CHARTER. PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST A CHARTER SCHOOLS IN UNITED STATES. IT WAS BECAUSE THE FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. STEPPED UP AND SAID CLEARLY. IF YOU DE CHARTER THIS SCHOOL WE WILL IMMEDIATELY. REACH CHARTER IT. AND SO I'D LIKE. TO SUGGESTED THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REALLY GOOD REASONS FOR PROTECTING [inaudible] QUALITY PERFORMING [inaudible] CHARTER SCHOOLS. FROM MISGUIDED POLITICAL INTERVENTION. AND IT WAS THE ABILITY OF THE FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AND IF YOU KNOW FRESNO COUNTY IT IS A BIG. GEOGRAPHIC PLACE LOTS OF MILES. AND IT WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ABILITY. I TO RE. TO TO PUSH BACK ON WHAT AMOUNTED TO A A MISGUIDED EFFORT TO UNDO A REALLY QUALITY -- AT A PRACTICE ON THE CAMPUS OF FRESNO STATE UNIVERSITY IT'S RENOWNED IN AND AWARD WINNING. SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE START TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF SUGGESTING THAT. ONLY OF A FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. OR ONLY SOME OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED AND THEREFORE -- WE OUGHT TO JUST. ESSENTIALLY HANDS OFF AND LET THEM DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WHAT I REALLY THINK IS IMPORTANT IS AND WHY I'M GOING TO BE A RESPECTFUL NO HERE. IS THAT THERE REALLY I THINK MUST BE. A REALLY SAFE HARBOR. FOR QUALITY CHARTER SCHOOLS. THAT FIGHTING THE THE WINDS OF SOME POLITICAL. POINT OF VIEW OUR BIAS. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO FRESNO. COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT YOU AND IT'S AND IT'S BEEN MORE THAN JUST ONCE WHERE FRESNO COUNTY OF OFFICE EDUCATION HAS STEPPED IN AND SAID. TO FRESNO UNIFIED YOU WILL NOT THE CHARTER DECERTIFY OR WE WILL STEP IN. AND CERTIFY SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL GOOD BALANCE GOING ON AT LEAST IN THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT AND I FEAR THAT THIS. BILL REALLY WENT ON DO THAT OPTION. SO I'M GONNA BE A RESPECTFUL -- NO HERE OF HOPE OTHER MEMBERS WOULD THINK SERIOUSLY AND ALSO OPPOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS PATTERSON MS CARILLO [inaudible] MISS KOREA [inaudible] MR OF DONALD -- IF YOU DRESS ANY QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOTHES MS CARILLO. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GOING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL TODAY. MY DISTRICT ASSEMBLY DISTRICT FIFTY ONE IS HOME TO THE HIGHEST DENSITY CHARTER DISTRICT IN THE STATE. THIS IS WHAT I'VE INHERITED AS A NEW MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE. AND SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE WE HAVE VOTED ON SEVERAL BILLS. THAT HOLD CHARTERS ACCOUNTABLE. I BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL. I BELIEVE IN OUR TEACHERS. BUT I ALSO KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN MY DISTRICT. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN A GOOD CLASSROOM. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE IN A MAGNET PROGRAM. I ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE KICKED OUT OF THAT MAGNET PROGRAM. PUT INTO AN HONORS PROGRAM GET KICKED OUT OF THAT. AND THEN FINALLY GET PLACED INTO A REGULAR CLASSROOM. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE RE ENROLLED. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE A TEACHER. THE LOOKED OUT FOR ME THE PRINCIPLE THAT LOOKED OUT FOR ME. THAT MADE SURE THAT I GRADUATED. I WENT TO ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL IN BOYLE HEIGHTS WHICH HAD AT THE TIME IN THE NINETIES. THREE TRACKS AB AND C.. FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS OVERCROWDED. HALF OF MY CLASS MORE THAN HALF OF MY CLASS DROPPED OUT I WAS ONE OF THEM. BUT I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GRADUATE ON TIME. I THINK ABOUT THOSE CLASSMATES. WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM WHY WERE THEY FORGOTTEN? IN ITS BECAUSE WE HAD A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. THAT WASN'T LOOKING OUT FOR THEM. IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHICH I'VE SPOKEN ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT BEFORE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT. THE CHICANO STUDENT WALKOUTS WHICH THIS BODY RECOGNIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME [inaudible] LAST YEAR. IN THIS STUDENT PROTEST. WAS ABOUT THREE THINGS. THAT WERE THE MOST PRIORITY. LACK OF RESOURCES OVERCROWDED CLASSROOMS. AND RUN DOWN FACILITIES THAT WAS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BATHROOMS WERE LOCKED IN STUDENTS HAD TO RELIEVE THEMSELVES IN BUSH'S. THERE WAS NO DIGNITY TO BEING A STUDENT ON THE EAST SIDE. LINCOLN WILSON FRANKLIN GARFIELD ALL IN MY DISTRICT ROOSEVELT. WHICH IS WHERE I WENT TO SCHOOL. ALL PRO TESTED IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. WE HAVE DE FUNDED OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE HAVE PRIORITIZED INCARCERATION. THERE WASN'T A NEW HIGH SCHOOL BUILT IN MY COMMUNITY. UNTIL THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. SO FOR DECADES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FAILED. STUDENTS LIKE ME. IN MY COMMUNITY. I CANNOT. IN GOOD CONSCIOUS. IN BEING A RESPONSIBLE MEMBER OF THIS BODY. CONTINUED TO POLITICIZE EDUCATION. FOR KIDS LIKE ME ACROSS THE STATE. IT. HURTS MY HEART. THERE WE PICKED PARENTS AGAINST EACH OTHER I HAVE PARENTS IN MY DISTRICT. THAT SEND THEIR KIDS TO TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS. CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS CHOICE HAS ALWAYS BEEN. AN A THING THAT PEOPLE CAN HAVE IF THEY COULD AFFORD IT. MY PARENTS WANTED TO SEND MY SISTERS AND I TO A PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY KNEW. OUR TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR FAILING KIDS THEY JUST COULDN'T AFFORD IT. AND I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD A MOM THAT FIGURED OUT HOW TO WORK THE MAGNET PROGRAM. AND SHE FIGURED IT OUT FOR ME IN MY YOUNGER SISTERS. THAT'S NOT THE CASE FOR EVERYONE. AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE. FOR NEW IMMIGRANT AMERICANS WHO ARE LEARNING THE SYSTEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHY WE CONTINUE TO POLITICIZE EDUCATION WHEN THE ISSUE REALLY IS ABOUT FUNDING? THE REAL ISSUE IS A WHY HAVE WE NOT PRIORITIZE. PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IT BECAUSE KIDS LOOK MORE LIKE ME. BECAUSE THERE IMMIGRANT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS BLACK OR BROWN KIDS ACROSS THE STATE. I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. AND THE NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. AND I WANT TO GET US TO A PLACE. WHAT WE THOUGHT HAVING THIS POLITICAL FIGHT THIRTY SECOND AND HAVE THE FIGHT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WHICH IS ABOUT FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS? I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIOUS. SUPPORT ANY ADDITIONAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE PITS PARENTS AGAINST EACH OTHER. IN KIDS AGAINST A SYSTEM. THAT HAS FOR DECADES NOT SERVICE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS CARILLO. THERE'S NO APPLAUSE DURING DEBATE MEMBERS MISTER SMITH. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY AS SOMEONE WHO HAS SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER. IN THE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT. AND IMPROVE PUBLIC EDUCATION MUCH TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES CONCERNS. I HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS OF EVERYONE IN THIS BODY WHOSE COMMUNITY CONTAINS FAMILIES WHO WANT A BETTER OPTION. WHO WANT CHOICE WHO WANT TO BE AWAY FROM WHAT THEY PERCEIVE AND SOMETIMES RIGHTFULLY SO? TO BE A FAILING. LOOK SCHOOL SYSTEM. IT IS UNAVOIDABLE IN THIS MOMENT. THAT WE ARE POLITICIZING. THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS. GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE A NEW FUNDING STREAM TO INCREASE OUR LOCAL CONTROL BASS GRANT NOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS. THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION INCREASINGLY CHALLENGES EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND VERY OFTEN CHARTERS ARE NOT SERVING THOSE STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. TO THE POINT WE ARE NOW. WHERE IF WE DON'T MAKE THESE CRITICAL DECISIONS IF WE DO NOT ALLOW LOCALLY ELECTED SCHOOL BOARDS? TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND WE SAY WE KNOW BETTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEN WE ALSO DO NEED TO BE WILLING TO STEP WHAT UP WITH THE FUNDING. TO IMPROVE EVERY SINGLE PUBLIC SCHOOL. BUT WHAT THIS MEASURE SPEAKS TO RIGHT NOW IS ALLOWING US TO TAKE A PAUSE. TO HAVE A VEHICLE TO SEND OVER TO THE SENATE WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A TASK FORCE. TO SET US ON A COURSE ON HOW WE MERGE BOTH OF THESE WORLDS. BECAUSE I COME FROM A TIME WHEN I WORKED AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHERE I SPENT MY WEEKENDS SERVING INTERCITY SCHOOLS TRYING TO MAKE IT JUST. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS PAINTING REINSTALLING BATHROOM DOORS AND AT THE TIME THE CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT WAS IN ITS INFANCY AND I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. STOP AT NOTHING FOR THOSE KIDS TO BE LED BY INNOVATIVE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS IN WHAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF A CHARTER MOVEMENT. IT SHOWED PROMISE AND IN MANY CASES AND IN MANY OF YOUR COMMUNITIES YES IN FACT IT HAS DELIVERED THAT PROMISE. BUT WHERE WE COMPLETELY DROPPED THE BALL IS IN ENSURING THAT WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CHARTER SCHOOL MOVEMENT. AIMED AT INFORMING A FEEDBACK LOOP OF IMPROVING SCHOOLS FOR ALL KIDS HAS NOW BECOME ABOUT POLITICS AND SILOS WE HAVE A UNIQUE MOMENT HERE TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP. IN GETTING US IN THAT DIRECTION I IS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM COMMITTED. TO MOVING THIS VEHICLE ALONG TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TO HONOR AND RECOGNIZE THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE EVERY DAY RIGHT NOW IN GREAT CHARTERS I HAVE SOME IN MY COMMUNITY. I HAVE GRANADA HILLS CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC DECATHLON TOP PERFORMER EVERY YEAR NATIONALLY. SCV AYE INTERNATIONAL DOES FANTASTIC AN INNOVATIVE THINGS WITH THEIR STUDENTS WE HAVE TO HONOR THAT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OUT OF THOSE CLASSROOMS. AND GET SERIOUS ABOUT FUNDING THE REST OF PUBLIC EDUCATION SO THAT NO FAMILY HOUSE TO MAKE A CHOICE. THAT'S THE POINT WE'RE AT COLLEAGUES. FAMILIES SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE SO LET US GET THERE LET US CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS PROCESS TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL. IS A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL THIS MEASURE HELPS US GET THERE DOCTOR WEBER [inaudible] YOUR RECOGNIZED. MISTER SPEAKER IN MEMBERS I RISE -- IN OPPOSITION. TO FIFTEEN OH FIVE I THINK MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT -- SO IS NO NEWS TO ANYONE I DID NOT GO FOR THIS BILL. AND I WAS GREATLY CONCERNED EVEN IN THE COMMITTEE THAT WHEN THE BILL CAME FORWARD IT ALREADY HAD WAS PASSED WOULD SEEM LIKE A KANGAROO COURT IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE THERE WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE THERE TO SPEAK. BUT THE BILL HAVE FOUR AUTHORS ON IT AND ALL OF THOSE FOR MOST THAT FIVE BUT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE RIGHT ON THE COMMITTEE. THE ONLY FOUR VOTES TO PASS IT SO THE DONE DEAL IN THE COMMITTEE WAS NOT EVEN WORTH HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT. BUT MY CONCERN IS FAIRLY SIMPLE THIS IS -- THIS IS A SERIOUS CONVERSATION. THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. IN THIS HOUSE. AMONG A LOT OF PEOPLE AND NOT JUST AMONG THE FEW A ONE ORGANIZATION OF TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT DECIDE THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS. THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THIS TO TALK ABOUT KIDS. THE ONE PIECE THAT DOES TALK ABOUT KIDS SAYS BUT IT WILL REMOVE FROM THE CHARTER LEGISLATION. WOULD DELETE THE PROVISION RELATING A AND I'M MAY I HAVE PERMISSION TO READ THE BILL OBVIOUSLY TO EVERYBODY. WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINETY FIVE SAYS THIS BILL WILL DELETE THE PROVISION RELATING TO INCREASES IN PUPIL ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR. THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO REVOKE A CHARTER. THE BILL WOULD ALSO DELETE THE PROVISION FOR APPEAL OF THE REVOCATION OF A CHART ABOUT CHARTERING AUTHORITY. FOR ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT A STUDENT PERFORMANCE. THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. NOT ALL THE OTHER STUFF BUT MOST IMPORTANT THAT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT MY COMMUNITY. AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW CHARTERS HAVE DONE WHATEVER THAT WE THINK THEY'VE DONE TO THE TO THE DISTRICTS. BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT PRIOR TO CHARTERS COMING TO EXISTENCE THAT WAS ALSO UNDER PERFORMANCE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT THAT WASN'T THIS GREAT EXPERIENCE IN THE SCHOOLS BUT MOST OF THE KIDS WERE IN INNER CITIES. AND SO IT IT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE ALL OF A SUDDEN CHARTER COMES IN THEN OBVIOUSLY THINGS HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS THAT IS NOT THE CASE AND WE KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE. BECAUSE YOU ALL AROUND IN THE NINETIES AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN SCHOOLS IN THE ISSUES OF UNDER PERFORMANCE WAS STILL THERE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND AS I STATE IN THE COMMISSION THESE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PREMATURE WHY WOULD YOU FORM A TASK FORCE YOU WILL SAY GO AHEAD AND WE CAN MAKE CHANGES AS WE GO ALONG BUT WHY WOULD YOU FORM A TASK FORCE. WHOSE JOB IS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF CHARTERING AN AUTHORIZATION AND FINANCES. AND BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE FROM CHARTERS FROM SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM LEADERSHIP ALTHOUGH SO TOGETHER TO LOOK AT THIS VERY COMPLEX ISSUE. WE TRY TO BE FAIR ABOUT IT AND THEN WE ALSO LEGISLATION PUSH IT FORWARD WITH THE IDEA THAT WE AS A SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. PUSH IT FORWARD. SO THEN IT BECOMES EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO AMEND AND TO CHANGE. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. AND THAT'S WHY THE EVIDENCE IS IN HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS THERE'S VERY LITTLE IN THIS BILL THE TALKS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FOR KIDS IN TERMS OF PERFORMANCE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE THE MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE CLAMORING FOR BETTER SCHOOLS. AND WITH US TO COME IN AND CREATE A PROCESS THAT ONE MAY DID NOT THEM AN OPPORTUNITY THERE SOME DISTRICTS TO DO VERY GOOD JOB AND I SOMEHOW DON'T. AND WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT IN TERMS OF THE BOARDS THEMSELVES IN CHARTERING AND IF THE MAIN REASON TO ACCEPT OR DENY A CHARTER IS BASED ON HIS FINANCIAL ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MANY MANY OF OUR CHARTS WOULD NEVER GET CHARTER. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT WOULD IS GOING TO IMPACT THE ECONOMICS AS THEIR WE THOUGHT CHARTERS WE'RE GOING TO INFORM DISTRICTS ABOUT HOW TO BE BETTER. AND INSTEAD THEY HAVE BECOME THE ENEMY OF EACH OTHER. AND WE NEED TO GET BACK TO THAT BUT THISBILL WILL MAKE THEM EVEN MORE ENEMIES. BECAUSE I CHARTERS ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONVERSATION. THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY GET A CHARTER BECAUSE NOW THEY ONLY HAVE THE BOARD TO DEAL WITH IN THE POLITICS OF THE LOCAL BOARD TO HAVING BEEN ON ONE BEFORE I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. AND NO APPEAL PROCESS THAT SOUNDS SO UNFAIR TO ME AND IN A DEMOCRACY THAT YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL TO A HIGHER POWER. TO ANOTHER BOARD WE HAVE A STATE BARD THAT'S BEEN AUTHORIZED TO DO TO BASICALLY HANDLE THE EDUCATION OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WITH WOOD WHAT CUTTING OFF THOSE AVENUES AND MAKING IT ONLY SO THAT THEY CAN ONLY GO ONE WAY. I THINK THIS IS PREMATURE. I THINK THAT THE ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX AND OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TELLING US THAT. AND THAT WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS ABSENCE OF A REPORT THAT COMES OUT TO TELL US HOW ARE STE WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR CHARTERS HOW TO BEST AUTHORIZES CHARTERS WHAT KIND OF ISSUES NEED TO BE THERE. CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS WE MAY WE MADE ASSUMPTIONS IN HERE THAT THE CHARGES ARE BREAKING THE SCHOOLS FINANCIALLY WE MAY DISCOVER THE REPORT THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE. THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE. BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING THE CHILDREN OBVIOUSLY THEY NEED THE RESOURCES TO WORK WITH THE KIDS. JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE ARE UNPREPARED TO ANSWER AND TO RUSH THIS BILL THROUGH EVEN HANG IT UP THE AND WHAT WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING ELSE AND ALL WAS A SURPRISE AND NOW IT'S COMING FORWARD. YOU KNOW THAT IN ITSELF IS RATHER INTERESTING. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE ARE NOT PREPARED TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND I WOULD ARGUE I WOULD URGE YOU NOT TO EITHER TO ABSTAIN WHICH REALLY NOT TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL AT THIS TIME BECAUSE THERE'S MUCH MORE INFORMATION NECESSARY. AND WE TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE IN THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK GOD WEBER MISTRUST AN OLDIE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I RISE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO FIFTEEN OH FIVE AND I'D LIKE TO RELATE A PERSONAL STORY I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ANYONE IN THIS CHAMBER KNOWS ABOUT ME BUT MY OLDEST SON. HAD SOME SEVERE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER HE WAS BORN WITH A ADVANCED INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY IN A DIMINISHED EMOTIONAL CAPACITY. AND LIKE MANY GIFTED CHILDREN THAT CAUSED HIM A LOT OF PROBLEMS EARLY IN HIS LIFE. WHEN IT CAME TIME TO SEND HIM TO KINDERGARTEN? WE HAD A REALLY STARK DECISION TO MAKE BECAUSE SENDING HIM TO SCHOOL WITH OTHER CHILDREN WOULD HAVE REQUIRED MEDICATING HIM. AND MY WIFE AND I WERE UNWILLING TO DO THAT. SO WE MADE THE CHOICE TO HOME SCHOOL HIM BUT IT WAS A DIFFICULT CHOICE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL I DON'T. THINK THAT I'M QUALIFIED TO TEACH A CHILD. YEAH MY WIFE FELT THE SAME WAY SO WE HOME SCHOOLED WITH THE AID OF A CHARTER SCHOOL AND WAS A VIRTUAL ACADEMY IT TURNED OUT TO BE PERFECT FOR US WE COULD GO ONLINE EVERY DAY. WE HAD A LESSON PLAN WE GOT WEEKLY VISITS FROM A CERTIFIED TEACHER WE PARTICIPATED IN STANDARDIZED TESTING THEY GAVE US THE CONFIDENCE THAT WE NEEDED. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND WHEN IT CAME TIME. FOR HIM TO GO -- TO HIGH SCHOOL HE SAID TO HIS HIS BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS HAD RESOLVED HE EXPRESSED. A DESIRE TO GO TO PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL AND WE AGREED AND HE WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. HE WENT ON HE GOT STRAIGHT IS FROM HIS FIRST DAY THERE HE WAS VALEDICTORIAN OF HIS CLASS. I HE'S NOW CAL TECH. HE'S GETTING STRAIGHT IS THERE IS MAJORING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS YOU CAN TELL I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM. WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. WITHOUT THE AID OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL THAT WE PARTICIPATED IN. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS AND THIS BILL ACTUALLY HAS A LOT OF SUPPORTABLE THINGS AT IT I'M NOT AGAINST. HOLDING CHARTER SCHOOLS ACCOUNTABLE I'M NOT AGAINST SHUTTING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT FAIL THE CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE SERVING I'M NOT AGAINST CHAU SHUTTING DOWN CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT FAIL TO ACHIEVE HIGHER ACADEMIC RESULTS. THAN -- OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS FOR WHOM CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST OPTIONS AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS IN THIS BILL OTHER PROVISIONS. THAT ARE CLEARLY INTENDED TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CHARTER SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS DON'T GET THEIR CHARTERS RENEWED AND A LOT OF THE CHARTERS WILL BE SHUT DOWN. UNDER THIS BILL ARE THE GOOD CHARTERS LIKE THE ONES THAT HELPED ME AND MY FAMILY WHEN WE WERE IN NEED TO SO I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. ON FIFTEEN OH FIVE THANK YOU METRO MILE T.. MR MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF ASSEMBLY BILL. FIFTEEN OH FIVE I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND THE CHICANO STUDENT WALKED OUT. IN EAST LA. IS OF HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. AND IF THIS BODY CHOOSES AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNS. DOCTOR WEBER BILL TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND MY BILL TO TEACH ETHNIC STUDIES IN THE HIGH SCHOOLS WILL MAKE SURE. THAT STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THAT HISTORICAL OF THAT IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT IT WAS TRUE. THE BEFORE IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT LATINO STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WERE TRACKED. AND MOST OF THEM WERE TRACKED. IN THE IN. NOT COLLEGE BOUND NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT I THINK THERE WERE LESS THAN [inaudible] TEN COLLEGE LATINO COLLEGE STUDENTS ATTENDING UCLA. YESTERDAY MONDAY WE CELEBRATED. THE HUNDRED YEAR. OF UCLA. AND THE NUMBER OF LATINOS IT UCLA TODAY. IS MANY MANY TIMES MORE THAN IT WAS IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT BUT THE STUDENTS THAT WALKED OUT IN. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE'RE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STUDENTS THAT WALKED OUT IN LA UNIFIED THIS YEAR. AND I WAS IN LA. I WAS AT MADISON HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES. AND WHEN I WALKED MARCHED AND CHANTED WITH THE STUDENTS PARENTS [inaudible] AND TEACHERS. OF UC OF OF OF LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I WAS VERY MUCH REMINDED. OF THE WALKED OUT OF NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT AND I DO THINK THAT WE ARE AT A JUNCTURE. WHERE WE DO NEED TO DECIDE? ARE WE OR ARE WE NOT GONNA SUPPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THIS NATION. IS THIS A SYSTEM THAT SAID IT WAS FOR EVERYONE. BEFORE THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT WAS ONLY THE FEW WHO WERE EDUCATED. BUT THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAME ABOUT IN THIS NATION WHEN IMMIGRANTS. WITH IMMIGRANTS. CAME ONTO THE SHORES. AND THE UNITED STATES NEW AND RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD TO EDUCATE ALL. AND THAT IS WHEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STARTED IN THE UNITED STATES. SO WE NEED TO DECIDE TODAY. WILL WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PUBLIC EDUCATION. I VERY MUCH AGREE. THAT IT IS A DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE AND THAT. BEING NUMBER FORTY ONE IN THE NATION. IN FUNDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND HAVING THE LARGEST CLASS SIZE PER TEACHER. HAVING THE LESS. AMOUNT OF COUNSELORS PER STUDENT. IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. AND WE SAW. DURING THE LA UNIFIED. TEACHERS STRIKE. THAT CHARTERS DO DRAW UPON. AND TAKE AWAY FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WHAT BEGAN AS A MODEL IS NOW BECOME AN INDUSTRY. AN INDUSTRY THAT TAKES AWAY FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION. DECISIONS ARE MADE BASS WHEN THEY ARE CLOSE TO HOME THERE IS NO BETTER ENTITY TO MAKE THE DECISIONS THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD AND I SAY THAT BOTH. AS A TEACHER AND A PAST SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON A. B.. FIFTEEN OH FIVE MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I'M GONNA START BY ADMITTING THIS IS A TOUGH SUBJECT. A LOT OF YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I CAME FROM THE LABOR MOVEMENT. I REPRESENTED -- TEACHERS. I'M ALSO A CHARTER SCHOOL PARENTS. AND AND THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO ADMIT. THERE'S A CONFLICT THERE AND I COULD PROBABLY TELL YOU IN DOUBT. EVERYTHING GOOD OR BAD. ABOUT MY KIDS SCHOOLS. I SEE IT UP CLOSE. I SEE THE FACT. THAT MY KIDS GO TO A SCHOOL DESPITE A DISTRICT THAT OVERWHELMINGLY LATINO IN SPANISH SPEAKING. TO A SCHOOL THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ENGLISH LEARNER AT I'VE NEVER SEEN A SPECIAL ED STUDENTS. ON THE ONE HAND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE INNOVATION. THAT SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ENGAGING IN. AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOVEMENT IS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE VERY LIMITED. IN THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT INNOVATION AND SCALE IT. SO THAT EVERY KID IN EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL WOULD HAVE THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES. MY KIDS ATTEND. COOPERATIVE CHARTER SCHOOLS IT DIDN'T START THAT WAY. START WITH ONE OR TWO IT'S CALLED HIGH TECH HIGH IT'S VERY FAMOUS. AND WHEN IT STARTED THERE WAS NOTHING TO NOT LOVE ABOUT IT BESIDES THE LACK OF DIVERSITY WHICH HAS ALWAYS BOTHERED ME IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAUSED MY DAUGHTER. BEING HALF BLACK AND HALF LATINA TO PULL HERSELF. OUT OF A CHARTER SCHOOL BECAUSE SHE WAS SICK OF BEING PARADED AROUND FOR AUTHORIZES AS IF SHE WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SCHOOL. SHE SAID THIS IS AT AT TEN COULD SAY THIS IS WRONG. THEY WANT TO ACT LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT SERVING STUDENTS LIKE ME. MAYBE BECAUSE WORK HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY THAN THE PEOPLE IN OUR DISTRICT BUT IT'S NOT. AND SO BECAME THIS IDEA BUT NOW EVEN A GRADE SCHOOL LIKE HIGH TECH HIGH. CONTINUES TO OPEN UP ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER SCHOOL. SO SCHOOL THAT USED TO BE KIND OF A NEIGHBORHOOD SERVING AREA SCHOOL NOW HAS INTO ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS AWAY ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL. IT HAS FIVE OR SIX HIGH SCHOOLS. TWO OR THREE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FOUR MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE EACHERS WHO PUT IN TIME AT A SCHOOL GET MOVED AROUND FROM SCHOOL TO SCHOOL. SO YOUR BEST MOST QUALIFIED TEACHERS ARE BEING MOVED OUT OF WHAT USED TO BE A LITTLE GREAT BET. OF OF OF EXPERIMENT. OF TRYING THINGS AND MAKING THEM WORK. OF ACTUALLY CREATING A MARKET PLACE OF THE TEACHERS WERE PROVIDED. A GOOD SALARY AND AND THE INCENTIVE TO STAY THERE IS NOW BEING DESTROYED BECAUSE AS THAT GROWS. THAT'S NOT BE PROVIDED WERE SEEN IN OUR LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITUATION BY WHICH TO TEACHERS. TO TEACHERS WHO HAVE BEEN LONGEST SERVING THERE AND HAVE GREAT RECORDS THEY ARE THE STATE THE TEACHERS WHO PROVIDE THE MOST TO STUDENTS. ARE ARE NOT BEING HAVING THEIR CONTRACTS RENEWED BECAUSE THE CHARTER SCHOOL. HAS NO BASIS BY WHICH THEY KEEP A TEACHER R. DON'T AND ONCE YOU BECOME TOO EXPENSIVE. YOU'RE EXPENDABLE. THAT NOT ONLY HURTS THE TEACHER BUT IT HURTS EVERY KID IN THAT SCHOOL. ALL I CAN SAY IS CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT ON ITS OWN. A BAD IDEA I SUPPORT CHOI HAVING SOME LIMITED CHARTER SCHOOLS. I I I I HAVE ALWAYS TOLD THE TEACHERS UNION THAT TO OPPOSE ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS SEEM COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. THIS IS HOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL TEACHERS SHOULD WANT TO NOT HAVE TO ABIDE BY SOME STREET CURRICULUM TO BE ABLE TO EXPERIMENT. TO TO HAVE NEW LIVE LEARNING STANDARDS FOR ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT KIDS BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING ANYMORE. AND WE'RE LEAVING BEHIND SO MANY KIDS. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO RECONCILE THAT. I'VE BEEN CALLED A HYPOCRITE AN IN THAT'S I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD. I'M NOT SAYING THIS CHARTER SCHOOLS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY KIDS BUT NOBODY ELSE WHAT I'M SAYING IS IT'S TIME TO PRESS PAUSE. BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET BACK TO WHAT THIS MOVEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. HOW WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH THE IDEAS THAT ARE IN KEEPING IN CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THAT WE DON'T DECIMATE? COMMUNITIES BY PULLING KIDS OUT THE BEST IN THE BRIGHTEST OUT OF OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SENDING THEM SOMEWHERE ELSE UNTIL THAT SCHOOL WANTS TO CLOSE DOWN OR CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE DOING THINGS. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE ANSWER I DON'T. BUT I WANT ONE OF THESE BILLS TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS TASK FORCE WILL COME UP WITH REALLY GOOD IDEAS AND WE NEED A VEHICLE TO PUT THOSE IDEAS THAN. THIRTY SECONDS I HOPE TODAY THAT WE KEEP THIS DISCUSSION GOING BY PASSING ONE OF THESE BILLS. I'M CHARTER SCHOOL PARENT WHO WANTS TO BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE WE WILL HAVE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT WORK HAND IN HAND WITH OUR TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN A VERY LIMITED WAY. THE CONTINUE AND THAT WILL PROTECT OUR TEACHERS AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO MY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU NOBODY AT THE STATE BOARD. REALLY CARES WHAT I THINK ABOUT MY LOCAL CHARTER SCHOOL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. MS QUIRK SILVA. DIRECTNESS. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. MEMBERS WE ARE AT A CRISIS WE'RE IN A CRISIS IN EDUCATION SO TODAY'S DISCUSSION IN THIS BILL PERTAINS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WITH. OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION BUT THERE ARE SO MANY CRISIS IS AN EDUCATION WE CAN ALL OF US STAND HERE ALL DAY LONG AND TALK ABOUT THE GOOD THINGS THE BAD THINGS AND REALLY THE DESTRUCTIVE THINGS. LAST NIGHT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE A DOCUMENTARY THAT WAS PUT ON BY THE FIRST PARTNER -- JENNIFER. NEWSOM. THE GREAT AMERICAN LIE. AND THIS DOCUMENTARY FOCUSED UP IN ALL OAKLAND. AND IT SHOWED SOME PART OF PUBLIC SCHOOL JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS AND WHAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH EVERY SINGLE DAY -- AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE SCHOOLS BUT THE MESSAGES ARE FAILING STUDENTS AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER MYSELF FOR THIRTY YEARS. I HAVE SEEN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TEACHERS THAT ARE DEDICATED THAT IT YOU WOULD WANT YOUR CHILD TO HAVE WHO HAVE. DEVOTED THEIR TIME SPENT EXTRA HOURS ON THE WEEKENDS AND NIGHTS BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN THE SCHOOLS. PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT OFFER EVEN SCHOOL CHOICE IN THEIR SCHOOLS PARENTS TAKE THEIR KIDS IN MY CITY TO WHAT WE CALL THE HILL SCHOOLS AND THE FLAT LAND SCHOOLS ARE HAVING LINES WITH PARENTS PULLING THEM OUT. AND THESE ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND SO WHAT WE CREATE EVEN IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE THE HAVES AND THE HAVE NOTS THE PARENTS THAT CAN PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION HAVE ACCESS TO MOVE THEIR KIDS. THEY MOVE THEM AND WHAT HAPPENS IS MANY OF OUR TITLE ONE SCHOOLS ARE LEFT WITH THE LEAST QUALIFIED TEACHERS WITH PARENTS NOT BEING ABLE TO ADVOCATE AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN DISCUSS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND AGAIN CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE INNOVATIVE THEY CAN BE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SOME OF THE OPPOSITE SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY MAKING A DECISION ON ARE WE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT CONVERSATION OR WE GONNA STAND STILL. OR GO BACKWARDS AND TO BE HONEST ALL RIGHT TO THE AUTHOR. MADE A COMMITMENT LAST WEEK WHEN TALKING TO HIM. UP AND TO SEE T. A. WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH FOR THIRTY YEARS BUT I AM CONFLICTED IN SO TODAY I WILL GIVE MY VOTE. TO MOVE FORWARD BUT I URGE US TO CONTINUE THIS CRITICAL CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ARE FAILING STUDENTS WE HAVE FOURTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I WANT TO KNOW I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE REPORTS IN THE LC FF I CARE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU. FOR THIRTY YEARS OF TEACHING I SAT WHAT THE BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTY FIVE STUDENTS WITH NO EXTRA HELP NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY WE PUT INTO THE SCHOOLS MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SPECIAL ADD. IN MY CLASS WITH MAYBE A A SPECIAL ED TEACHER COMING IN FOR THIRTY MINUTES I HAD TO PUT UP A BOARD TO SHOW HOW MANY KIDS WERE COMING IN AND OUT IN AND OUT. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE PROFESSIONALS THEY ARE TO BE IN THE CLASS WITH US THERE'S SO MUCH THAT I CAN SAY MEMBERS BUT WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S CHARTER SCHOOLS WE HAVE TO BE BETTER WE CANNOT CONTINUE. TO PUT KIDS IN UP PLACES AND I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHARTER OR PUBLIC WHERE THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTED. PARENTS ARE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST BY WORKING JOBS AND THE LEAST THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT IS THAT OUR KIDS CAN GO TO SCHOOL AND A SAFE PLACE AND THAT THEY CAN LEARN. THAT'S WHAT EDUCATION ABOUT IT'S ABOUT LEARNING LEARNING TO WRITE TO READ A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT LITERATURE AND HISTORY AND CHARACTERS AND WE POLITICIZE THIS AND WE HAVE. THIS WAR BETWEEN CHARTERS AND PUBLIC SCHOOL WE'RE MAKING IT WORSE SO TODAY I WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL. BUT WITH GREAT CONCERN AND I ASK OUR MEMBERS TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE AND BRING THESE PEOPLE TOGETHER PARENTS TEACHERS AND LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS BECAUSE UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER WE CONTINUE THIS GREAT DIVIDE. AND THAT MOVIE LAST NIGHT DOCUMENTARY A GREAT LIFE I ASKED. I URGE YOU TO SEE IT BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY BEING TORN APART. THERE WAS QUIRK SILVA MS KAMLAGER-DOVE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU AYE AYE RISE. IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT WITH TREPIDATION BUT ALSO WITH SOME FAITH AND HOPE. THAT WE WILL USE THE POLITICAL COURAGE AND ANGER THAT IS ON THIS FLOOR TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO FIX OUR FAILING PUBLIC. SCHOOL EDUCATION SYSTEM. WE ARE POLITICIZING OUR KIDS AND WE ARE POLITICIZING THEIR FUTURE. BY DEMONIZING CHARTERS AND VICTIMIZING PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THERE ARE GOOD AND BAD ACTORS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. WE SHOULD BE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT FULLY FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION ABOUT RETOOLING PROP. NINETY EIGHT ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE LANDLORDS PROPERTY OWNERS WITH UNDER IN ROLLED SCHOOLS. BECAUSE PARENTS ARE USING THEIR CHOICE TO PUT THEIR KIDS SOMEPLACE ELSE. I'M A STEP MOTHER OF TWO KIDS IN A PUBLIC IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS I AM COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHERE OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO GO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TEACHERS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAFETY? ALL OF THOSE SCHOOLS WE'RE NOT LOOKING ABOUT THE CAFETERIA THE LANDSCAPING OR ANY OF THAT. AND WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS ARE IN FLUX ARE IN CRISIS WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND AN OBLIGATION TO FIND CHOICE SO THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING OUR KIDS. SO WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE FUNDING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION. WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT BECAUSE OF BUSING BECAUSE WHITE FOLKS TOOK THEIR KIDS OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE PASSED PROP THIRTEEN THAT WE RE DIRECTED FUNDING AND COMMITMENT? AWAY FROM OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE MOST FOLKS DON'T WANT TO WORK FIVE JOBS. TO AFFORD PRIVATE TUITION. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD TO TAKE THEIR LET'S KEEP IT REAL. SO I'M VOTING TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. BUT IN THAT VOTE IS A VOTE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR OUR KIDS RICH KIDS POOR KIDS MIDDLE CLASS KIDS WHO ALL DESERVE THE RIGHT. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR CHILD TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND AND KNOW THAT THEIR CHILD WILL BE SAFE. MS MELENDEZ YOUR RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I KNOW WE HAVE A A WHOLE PACKAGE OF BILLS COMING FORWARD TO ADDRESS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WE HAD. A LOT OF PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS ON THIS FLOOR ABOUT HOW CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE AFFECTED -- SOMEONE'S LIFE HOW PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE AFFECTED SOMEONE'S LIFE AND THAT'S GREAT BECAUSE THERE'S ROOM FOR ALL BUT LET'S REMEMBER THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY EMAILS I'VE RECEIVED AND I KNOW YOU RECEIVE THEM. TO ABOUT PARENTS WHO SAY THE PUBLIC SCHOOL IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WASN'T THE RIGHT FIT FOR MY CHILD. OR THE PUBLIC SCOOL IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD WAS FAILING. THE KIDS WHO ATTEND THERE. WE HAVE A MORE THAN HALF OF AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG BOYS YOU DON'T READ AT GRADE LEVEL IN pTHAT IS A FAILURE. WE HEARD THE CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT WHERE CALIFORNIA RANKS WITH RESPECT TO EDUCATION OUR LEVEL OF SUCCESS. THIS FUNDING HAS GONE LIKE THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH FUNDING IS GONE UP THE LEAD LOOKS OF SUCCESS HIS PAID FLAT. THAT'S NOT SUCCESS IN MY EYES I DON'T THINK IT IS YOURS EITHER. BUT TO DENY PARENTS AND CHILDREN. THE OPTION TO PUT THEIR CHILD IN A SCHOOL THAT BEST SUITS THEM WHETHER IT'S THEIR ACADEMIC NEEDS WHETHER IT'S THEIR BEHAVIORAL NEEDS. IT'S NOT OUR PLACE TO TO STAND BETWEEN THE PARENT AND CHILD AND THEIR EDUCATION BECAUSE YOU ONLY GET TO DO IT ONCE THERE'S NO GOING BACK. THERE NO DO OCCURS SO I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS BATTLE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE CHARTER SCHOOLS. I I UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL SIDE OF IT BUT FROM A PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE MY GOODNESS ARE SO MANY PEOPLE IN HERE. WHO ARE PARENTS MANY OF YOU NOW THANKFULLY IT'S A DIFFERENT LEGISLATURE IN THE MAKE UP IS YOUNGER AND YOU HAVE YOUNG KIDS AND WE HAD KIDS STILL IN SCHOOL? SO. I WOULD THINK THIS IS VERY PRESSING ON YOUR MIND. THE FACT THAT THIS THAT THE EDUCATION YOUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO GET OR NOT ABLE TO GET. IT'S SOMETHING YOU ONLY GET TO DO ONCE. THIS IS NOT A BATTLE BETWEEN PUBLIC SCHOOL IN CHARTER SCHOOL THIS IS A BATTLE FOR YOUR KIDS EDUCATION. I WOULD URGE YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU MISS MELENDEZ DOCTOR EGGMAN. YOUR RECOGNIZED. I THINK IT WAS SPEAKER MEMBERS -- I ALSO DID NOT PLAN TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL TODAY BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE I DID KNOW WAS ECONOMY COMING UP TODAY -- AND SO I I I DO ALSO TAKE OFFENSE TO IT A COMING UP AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T QUITE SURE AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HERE IT IS. AND LIKE ALL OF YOU I HAVE GOOD CHARTERS AND I HAVE NOT SO GOOD CHARTERS. AND I ALSO LIVE WHERE I PERSONALLY LIVE IN MY DISTRICT IS A HIGH POVERTY AREA. IT IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POVERTY AREAS IN MY CITY. AND ITS PEOPLE KNOW WHEN I MOVED% THERE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHILD AND NGUYEN KINDERGARTEN BEGAN ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD A CHILD AND SO I HAD TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT I WAS GONNA DO I AM A PRODUCT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. K. THROUGH TWELVE ALL THE WAY UP TO PHD ARE GOING TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND I'M A GIANT SUPPORTER IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- NGUYEN AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET MY CHILD INTO A MAGNET. THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE THAT IS A MAGNET AT ANOTHER PUBLIC SCHOOL. SHE'S NOW GRADUATING WITH A CAUGHT NOW PROMOTING A FIFTH GRADE. HER NEXT STEP IS TO FOR HER TO CONTINUE IN THAT MAGNET. SHE'S A TEN YEAR OLD IS A CENTER TO A COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL ACROSS TOWN. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MIDDLE YEARS ACADEMY AS THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A GOOD OPTION TO ME. MY TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHIN IN MY AREA. HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST TEST SCORES IN THE COUNTY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN OPTION FOR ME. SO I THEN AM BASED WIT THE ISSUE DO I SEND MY KID TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL DO I SEND MY KID TO A PAROCHIAL DO I SEND MY KID TO A CHARTER. AND NONE OF THOSE ARE EASY DECISIONS. I WANT LIKE EVERYBODY WANTS EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL WE HAVE TO BE FULLY FUNDED SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. BUT THE KID SHOULDN'T BE THE ONES PUT IN THE MIDDLE AND THE PARENTS SHOULDN'T BE THE ONE TO PUT IN THE MIDDLE. LIVING AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE PLACE I CAN TELL YOU UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE OF SPOKE THE CHARTER SCHOOL THAT I GO AND SEE ARE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE MOSTLY BROWN AND BLACK KIDS. WHO ARE WHO ARE THERE ATTENDING AND MANY DOING VERY WELL? MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO I ECHO THE THE THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SCHOOLS WERE NOT TALKING A STUDENT OUTCOMES. I AM ALSO PREPARE FOR THIS CONVERSATION GO FORWARD BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME REAL I ALSO THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR DATA WE'VE GOT TASK FORCE GOING ON FOR US TO BE. DOING THIS VERY QUICKLY COULD PUT AN URGENCY CLOSET DO THIS LATER. IS ALSO A LITTLE. DISINGENUOUS. BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE AND I WANT TO HEAR. AND IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE AMENDMENTS ON THE SIDE HAT MEANS GOT TO COME BACK HERE FOR CONCURRENCE. I THINK WE ALL WANT AN APPEAL PROCESS THAT IS FAIR. I ALSO HAVE A DISTRICT THAT HAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WHITE FLIGHT I HAVE FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS REPRESENTING ONE CITY. LET ALONE THE COUNTY. SO IN LESS THERE'S A GOOD PROCESS. FORD FOR SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO APPEAL THE PROCESS OF EITHER RE CHARTERING OR NEW CHARTER TO THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. I THINK IS A FLOP WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IS REALLY TALK ABOUT IT IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CALL. CONVERSATION CONTINUING AND A COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS MR O'DONNELL. YOU MAY CLOSE YES I THINK YOU MISTER. SPEAKER AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION HERE AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A CONVERSATION ABOUT CHARTERS ARE BAD. CHARTER GOOD CHARTERS ARE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT SUPPORTING ALL CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS AND ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTION HERE TODAY IS NOT OUR CHARTERS BAD AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE VOTE MEANS NOT AT ALL NOT AT ALL. IT IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT AND I JUST WANNA SPEAK TO MY MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO BROUGHT UP THAT HE HAD A LOCAL BOARD THAT EITHER ATTEMPTED TO OUR DID SHUT A HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL DOWN. FOR THE LEGAL SHOULD THIS BILL PASS THAT IS NOT THE INTENT HERE AND I DO WANT. TO RE RE ITERATE. AND I THINK I'VE DONE IT A COUPLE TIMES HERE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO DISCUSSING AND AMENDING THE RE AUTHORIZATION AUTHORIZATION PROCESS AND MAKING IT. FAIR I KNOW MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON SAYS SHE WANTS IT FAIR OKAY YEARS I'M LOOKING AT YOU RIGHT NOW I'M SAYING THE WORD FAIR. OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES WHO BROUGHT UP THERE ARE MANY HIGH PERFORMING. CHARTER SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I ABSOLUTELY CONCUR IN FACT ONE OF MY OWN FAMILY MEMBERS. HAS ATTENDED A CHARTER SCHOOL AND WHY AS MICE MY COLLEAGUE FROM STAMMERED YOU KNOW BROUGHT UP. IT WAS THE BEST FIT AND HAVE A CHARTER SCHOOL WORKS FOR YOU YOU SHOULD SEND YOUR CHILD THERE. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. RE LOOKING AT THE AUTHORIZATION AND RE AUTHORIZATION PROCESS SO WITH THAT -- I I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION A VERY SIMPLY.
