ONCE.

00:30:44.175 --> 00:30:45.810

FREE TIME.

00:30:47.312 --> 00:30:48.513

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.632
THE RIGHT TO READ MY CASE FILE

AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.418
MATTERS BECAUSE HOW ARE WE

00:31:27.485 --> 00:31:29.053

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:03.093
OPPOSITION.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.928
WE DO HAVE A MOTION BUT WE DON'T

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:04.962
HAVE A SECOND [inaudible]

00:41:05.029 --> 00:41:08.165

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:18.776
RAN THIS BILL FORD I DO HAVE A

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:19.677
QUESTION --

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:20.711
I THINK THERE WAS.

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.012
MAYBE ONE VALID ARGUMENT THAT

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.380
RACE BY OR AT LEAST QUESTION

00:41:23.447 --> 00:41:24.849
RAISED BY THE OPPONENTS --

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.650
IF IT CHILD IN THIS BILL --

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:27.918
UNDER THIS BILL --

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.920
DID WANT TO JOIN A HATE GROUP --

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:33.691
OR COULD BE A DANGER TO THEM OR

00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:35.626
OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS BILL

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.761
PROHIBIT PARENTS FROM --

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:40.865
ALLOWING THEM TO DO THAT OR

00:41:40.931 --> 00:41:42.366
FACILITATING THAT.

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:42.967
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:41:43.033 --> 00:41:45.135
SO IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY WANTED

00:41:45.202 --> 00:41:46.904
TO JOIN A HATE GROUP.

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:48.839
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO UNDER THE

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:49.773
LAW THEY THEY WOULDN'T AND YOUR

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.243
BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.911
PARENTS TO FACILITATE THAT THAT

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:54.478
IS CORRECT.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.079
OKAY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.615
CLARIFY THAT PERHAPS AS THE BILL

00:41:57.681 --> 00:41:59.216
MOVES FORWARD ABSOLUTELY OKAY

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.517
AND THEN ON THE OTHER QUESTION I

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:01.552
HAVE IS ABOUT THE INTERNET

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.187
ACCESS WHICH OF COURSE IS

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:05.256
SOMETHING IN TODAY'S WORLD THAT.

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:05.789
YOU COULD ARGUE IS VERY

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:06.657
IMPORTANT --

00:42:06.724 --> 00:42:08.058
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:09.860
RESTRICTING OR EVEN STOPPING

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.962
ACCESS TO THE INTERNET --

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.063
FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS COULD

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.267
BE APPROPRIATE A CHILD WHO IS.

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.568
USING THE INTERNET TOO MUCH NOT

00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:20.137
CONCENTRATING ON THEIR STAY

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:21.805
VIEWING INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL --

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.874
WITH THIS PROHIBIT PARENTS FROM

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:26.677
RESTRICTING THAT ACCESS BASED ON

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.746
ANY OF THOSE --

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:31.048
REASONS IT'S A REASONABLE --

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.950
IS REASONABLE ACCESS TO THE

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.318
INTERNET RIGHT NOW IS IS THERE

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.452
IS THERE GOING TO BE TO FIND

00:42:35.519 --> 00:42:37.187
SOMEWHERE IN THE BILL OR WHO

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.957
WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:42.326
WHAT THE PARENTS?

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.193
THE PARENT MAKE ABSOLUTELY AND

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.728
ALSO THERE'S MECHANISMS TO

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.964
CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THAT A CHILD

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:49.566
IT ARE IN BACK NOT NAVIGATING TO

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:51.735
SITES THEY SHOULD NOT BE --

00:42:51.802 --> 00:42:54.605
VIEWING AND PARTICIPATING IN SO

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:55.706
JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:56.640
LOT OF MEDALS IN THERE IF --

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.008
IF A FOSTER YOU THOUGHT THAT

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.743
THERE ACCESS WAS BEING

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:00.844
RESTRICTED UNREASONABLY.

00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:02.379
WHO WOULD THEY BRING THAT TO

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.914
THAN TO THEIR CASE WORKER TO

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:05.516
MAKE THE TERM FINAL

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.583
DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S UP

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.152
THERE'S ODDS THERE'S THE ODDS

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:09.186
BUT CEMENT OKAY THAT?

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:11.655
THEY CAN MAKE THEIR CONCERNS

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:13.590
MADE KNOWN UNTO THOSE INTO TO

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:15.092
THAT INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT AND

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.460
THEN THEY WILL ACT AS A CONDUIT

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:17.861
TO WANT TO THE INVESTIGATION

00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:18.562
ALSO TRIED TO RE WRITE

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:19.964
RESOLUTION PERFECT.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:24.168
THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE WELCOME

00:43:24.234 --> 00:43:25.970
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:26.570
THANK YOU AND AND I THINK WE

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:27.404
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT.

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:29.840
MAKING POLICY BASED ON TESTIMONY

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:31.575
THAT'S FEAR MONGERING THAT'S

00:43:31.642 --> 00:43:33.744
INACCURATE AND THAT IS IS REALLY

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.579
MEANT TO DRIVE AN EMOTIONAL

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:36.847
RESPONSE.

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:38.682
THE LOT OF THE LOGIC JUST.

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:42.920
SEEMS TO TO FAIL SO I I THINK.

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:44.688
MR GIPSON YOUR YOUR POLICIES IS

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.090
ABSOLUTE IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:46.690
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO

00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:47.858
MAKE SURE.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.626
THAT FOSTER KIDS BE RESPECTED

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:50.894
WITH WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:53.530
AND AND NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:56.000
OF THE IGNORANCE OF THE

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:58.102
CIRCUMSTANCE THAT A LOT OF TRANS

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.437
GENDER ANOTHER YOUTH ARE.

00:44:00.504 --> 00:44:01.605
THE DIFFICULTIES THAT THERE

00:44:01.672 --> 00:44:02.940
GOING THROUGH.

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.174
THIS NOTION THAT THERE WAS ****

00:44:04.241 --> 00:44:07.211
NILLY THING AND CAN BE TALKED

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.545
OUT OF SOMETHING.

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:10.147
IS JUST THERE'S NO SCIENTIFIC

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.282
BASIS FOR IT AND HAS CAUSED A

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:15.719
GREAT DEAL OF OF STRIFE AND AND

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.755
PROBLEMS HISTORICALLY NOT JUST

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:19.356

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:21.258
TRANSGENDER YOUTH.

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.760
THIS IS HAPPENED IN.

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:24.428
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AND

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:25.796

I MEAN I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:40.010
I THINK --

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:42.646
THE POINTS THAT I FOR CALLING

00:44:42.713 --> 00:44:44.181
MISS FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP AS FAR

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.015
IS --

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.583
DEFINING SOME OF THESE POINTS ON

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.853
GOING FORWARD WOULD DEFINITELY

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.656
BE BENEFICIAL. FOR WERE MAY BE

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:53.157
PLAN OFF SOME POSSIBLE

00:44:53.223 --> 00:44:55.125
OBJECTIONS FROM SOME OF THE

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:59.496
LANGUAGE IN THE FUTURE --

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.999
YOU KNOW I I DO HAVE A CONCERN

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:03.434
AND I SEE BOTH SIDES OF THIS.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:04.268
AND I YOU KNOW I I THINK THE

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:05.636
BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:06.837
MY AREA AND ESPECIALLY MY

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:10.441
DISTRICT IS THE LACK OF ACCESS

00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:11.508
TO FOSTER PARENTS.

00:45:11.575 --> 00:45:14.144
AND THE LACK OF HOMES LACK OF

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.612
HOMES ESPECIALLY --

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.448
FOR FOR SPECIAL NEEDS THAT NEED

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.682
TO GET INTO THE FOSTER CARE

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:21.185
SYSTEM BECAUSE OF BAD SITUATIONS.

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.821
AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE.

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:28.759
ANYTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT --

00:45:28.826 --> 00:45:29.960
YOU NO MORE PARENTS BEING ABLE

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.195
TO GET IN --

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.396
A I DO WANNA MAKE SURE THERE IS

00:45:32.463 --> 00:45:33.430
SOME KIND OF A MECHANISM WHERE

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:36.500
IF THERE IS A CHILD IN A FOSTER --

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.837
SITUATION AND AND THEY DO YOU --

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.371
DECIDE THEIR IDENTITIES

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:42.506
DIFFERENT OR THERE IS A

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.041
SITUATION WHERE THE FOSTER

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.676
PARENT NO LONGER FEELS

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.878
COMFORTABLE THERE IS AN OUT --

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.647
SO YOU DON'T HAVE SOMETHING IT'S

00:45:50.714 --> 00:45:51.715
INTO SOMETHING BAD --

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.650
FOR EITHER THE PARENT OR THE

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:54.251
CHILD BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:55.619
LOOSE --

00:45:55.686 --> 00:45:56.887
GOOD FOSTER PARENTS --

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.589
REGARDLESS WHAT THEIR RELIGIOUS

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:00.057
VALUES ARE --

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.492
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:05.562
ARE ON ENSURING THE CARE --

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:06.563
BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:07.965
ENOUGH FOSTER'S THERE'S THERE'S

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.166
NOT ENOUGH --

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.534
ESPECIALLY --

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:12.202
FOR CHILDREN THE EYEPIECE AND

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:13.237
SPECIAL NEEDS.

00:46:13.303 --> 00:46:15.305
SO I I JUST YOU KNOW MY QUESTION

00:46:15.372 --> 00:46:16.773
FOR YOU --

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.908
MISTER GIBSON I KNOW YOU WORKED

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.511
VERY DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THAT

PARENTS YESTER NOW.

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.358
I THINK THIS BILL HAS A GREAT

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:37.995
POTENTIAL OF ONE INCREASING --

00:46:38.061 --> 00:46:39.763
OF PARENTS TO TAKING IN FOSTER

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:40.864
CHILDREN.

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:42.399
ALSO UNDERSTANDING.

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:44.668
OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND THE

00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:45.769
TRAUMA THAT THESE FALSE SO

WITH ADULTS AND BEING AT THE

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.786
TABLE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.

FOSTER YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.922
HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE ITS

00:47:04.988 --> 00:47:06.857
FIRST CONCEPTION SO THIS IS

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.692
ALMOST TWENTY OF THIRTY YEARS

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:11.128

THIS BILL GOES A LOT FURTHER AND

00:47:20.003 --> 00:47:21.138
I JUST WANT TO INVITE THE

I GREW UP IN FOSTER CARE MYSELF

WHERE I EMANCIPATED --

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:17.707
I WAS ABLE TO BE IN THE SAME

ALSO TAKE THEIR LAST NAME BUT

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:27.517
FOR ME PERSONALLY IT FELT LIKE I

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:28.618
WAS LOSING A PIECE OF MY

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:29.819
IDENTITY.

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.054
THAT I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:32.222
WITH LEADER GOT IT TATTOOED

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:33.323
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO PERMANENT

00:56:33.389 --> 00:56:34.691
AND IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT I

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:36.259
WANTED TO BE PART OF THIS UNIT.

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.494
BUT THAT'S MY DECISION AND

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.763
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE AS A PERSON

00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:41.464
AND THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO GROW UP

00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:43.500
IN OUR TAKEN FROM THEIR

00:56:43.566 --> 00:56:45.068
COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILY IN

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.269
PEOPLE THAT THEY KNOW.

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:47.871
SCRAPS OF IDENTITY OR SOMETIMES

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:49.973
THE ONLY THING WE HAVE SO FOR

00:56:50.039 --> 00:56:51.241
THAT EXAMPLE SPECIFICALLY.

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.709
WITH THAT BEING SAID THAT DID

00:56:52.776 --> 00:56:55.111
NOT WATER DOWN MY FAMILY BONDS

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.546
WHEN I SPEAK OF MY MOM AND MY

00:56:56.613 --> 00:56:57.747
SISTERS.

00:56:57.814 --> 00:57:00.583
THEY ARE MY MOM AND MY SISTERS

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.885
RATE -- SO

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.520
THERE'S THAT ELEMENT OF THAT AND

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:04.487
IT YOU KNOW I THINK THE FIRST

00:57:04.554 --> 00:57:05.488
YOUTH BILL OF RIGHTS IS

00:57:05.555 --> 00:57:07.323
BEAUTIFUL AND IMPACTFUL FOR LOTS

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.924
OF REASONS.

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:09.325
IT DOESN'T POWER THE YOUNG

00:57:09.392 --> 00:57:10.426
PERSON A DOES HE QUIPPED

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.395
CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO KNOW WHAT

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:13.897
THEIR RIGHTS ARE BECAUSE A LOT

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:14.464
OF TIMES THEY'RE IN SURVIVAL

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.231
MODE.

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:17.000
AND A LOT OF TIMES THE SYSTEM

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.434
AND SOCIETY HAS GIVEN UP ON THEM

00:57:18.501 --> 00:57:21.171
TIME AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN SO

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.172
IF WE CAN EQUIP THEM WITH ONE

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:23.540
POLICIES BILL OF RIGHTS ON HOW

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:24.440
TO NAVIGATE.

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:26.476
THE SYSTEM THAT'S THE LEAST THAT

00:57:26.543 --> 00:57:27.677
WE CAN DO WHEN CHILDREN AND

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.212
YOUNG PEOPLE ENTERED THE FOSTER

00:57:29.279 --> 00:57:30.980
CARE SYSTEM THE STATE OF

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:32.515
CALIFORNIA ST WE CAN PARENT

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.717
BETTER THAN YOUR CURRENT

00:57:34.784 --> 00:57:35.418
CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.420
AND SO BY A IN GIVING THEM

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.521
CERTAIN ENTITLEMENTS AND RIGHT

00:57:38.588 --> 00:57:43.126
IT'S IT'S VERY MINIMAL MINIMAL.

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.060
THAT MEANS THAT NOT EVERYONE

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:44.694
FINDS PERMANENCY IN THE CHILD

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:45.962
WELFARE SYSTEM A LOT OF FOLKS

00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:48.164
EMANCIPATE WHEN THEY ARE

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:49.933
EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY ONE AND STILL

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:50.500
DON'T HAVE A FAMILY TO CALL

00:57:50.567 --> 00:57:51.601
THEIR OWN.

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:52.802
GIVING THEM THE TOOLS THEY NEED

00:57:52.869 --> 00:57:54.037
TO BE A SELF ADVOCATE TO

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.072
NAVIGATE COLLEGE IS INCREDIBLY

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.340
IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:59.275
DOCUMENT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

00:57:59.342 --> 00:58:01.077
DOES IS IT UPDATES IT FOR THE

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.111
YOUNG PEOPLE THAT.

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.546
DON'T FIND THE STABILITY WITHIN

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:06.349

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:27.437
IT IS THEIR BILL OF RIGHTS IS

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:29.172
IT'S AN EXTENSION OF WHAT WAS

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:30.540

AND WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:18.073
ABOUT THAT I THINK IT IS AS THE

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.442
DAY GOES ON SHOULD ALSO JUST

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.011
NOTE THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF

OTHER PLACEMENT TYPES --

01:11:22.878 --> 01:11:24.146
SO THOSE NUMBERS I GAVE YOU

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.080
DON'T ADD UP TO A HUNDRED THAT

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:27.549
OUR 2100% BUT A NUMBER OF THE UP

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.917
THERE ARE OTHERS OTHER PLACEMENT

01:11:28.984 --> 01:11:30.219
TYPES WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVE

01:11:30.285 --> 01:11:31.553
COURT SPECIFIED HOMES PRE

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.621
ADOPTIVE HOMES.

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.289
TRIAL HOME VISITS A NUMBER OF A

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:36.191
NUMBER OF SITUATIONS --

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.826
AND AS WELL AS AS IT WAS

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:39.328
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:11:39.395 --> 01:11:40.796
HEARING WE DO HAVE IN A NUMBER

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:42.431
OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO --

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:43.999
ARE LIVING I'M IN IN

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.901
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAMS OR

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.604

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:49.972
EXTENDED FOSTER CARE.

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:50.873
SO -- WE

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:53.208
HAVE A NUMBER OF THE MOST OF

01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:54.510
THAT AND THAT THE MINOR

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.345
DEPENDENCE IN OUR SYSTEM LIVE IN

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.846

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:03.686
TYPES.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:04.853
SO THERE ARE THE THE QUESTION I

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.487
THINK THAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:06.088
ABOUT --

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.856
ULTIMATELY IS SO WENT WHAT

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.058
HAPPENS WHITE WIRE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.359

IN SITUATIONS ARE IN IN HOMES

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:13.462
THAT AREN'T --

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:15.731
IN THE COUNTY IN WHICH THEY

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.331
THEIR FOR THEIR PARENTS HAVE

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.800
PRESIDED AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:12:17.866 --> 01:12:20.502
REASONS FOR THAT THE THE MOST

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:22.538
OFTEN IT'S BECAUSE THERE WITH

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.339
HER THERE WITH THE RELATIVE. TO

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:26.975
THAT THE RELATIVE OF MAY IN MAY

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.477
LIVE IN A DIFFERENT COUNTY BUT

01:12:28.544 --> 01:12:30.846
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THE THE

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:31.814
CONNECTIONS WITH THAT YOUNG

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.182
PERSON TO MINIMIZE THAT THE

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:35.117
EFFECTS OF TRAUMA --

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.319
A RELATIVE PLACEMENT IS OFTEN

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:39.254
SOUGHT AND SO THERE'S A GOOD --

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.090
I'LL GIVE YOU SPECIFIC NUMBERS

01:12:41.156 --> 01:12:41.757
FOR THAT --

01:12:41.824 --> 01:12:42.925
LATER --

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.593
ANOTHER REASON IS THAT SOMETIMES

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.795
YOUNG PEOPLE --

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.964
BECAUSE OUR IN ORDER TO PLACE

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.432
SIBLINGS TOGETHER TO KEEP KEEP

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.767
THAT LEVEL OF FAMILY CONNECTION

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:54.636
SOMETIMES THERE NEEDS TO BE A A

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.138
PLACEMENT ACROSS THE COUNTY LINE

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:56.705
EITHER.

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:57.873
AGAIN WITH A RELATIVE OR

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.241
SOMETIMES WITH A PRIVATE FOSTER

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:00.876
FAMILY AGENCY THAT'S ABLE TO

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:03.445
SUPPORT A LARGER GROUP OF OF

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.380
YOUNG PEOPLE TO STAY TOGETHER --

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:06.949
IN CERTAIN SOME SITUATIONS

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:08.650
DEPENDING ON THE THE NATURE OF

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:11.687
THE OF THE COUNTY --

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:14.389
AND THERE MAY NOT BE AS AT THAT

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:17.426
TIME AND SO IN ORDER --

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.528
TO HAVE AN EXPEDITIOUS --

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.230
PLACEMENT IN A FAMILY --

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:23.031
IT REQUIRES THAT A FAMILY --

01:13:23.098 --> 01:13:24.967
BE -- ACROSS

01:13:25.033 --> 01:13:26.301
THERE ANOTHER JURISDICTION BE

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:27.603
IDENTIFIED AND AND THE YOUNG

01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:29.037
PERSON'S PLACE THERE.

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:30.305
AND THEN ALSO AS A PART IT

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.007
SOMETIMES AS A PART OF THE YOUNG

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.041
PERSON'S HEALING FROM THE

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.510
COMPLEX TRAUMA THAT THEY'VE

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.377
EXPERIENCED.

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:36.178
THERE --

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.312
THEY NEED A STRUCTURED

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.782
RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AT LEAST FOR

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.316
IN A SHORT IT FOR A SHORT TIME.

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:45.187
AND THOSE OFTEN READ REQUIRE --

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.555
OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENTS THOSE

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.023
RESOURCES MARKET EVERY

PLACED OUT OF COUNTY.

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.002

YOU A WAY --

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.172
TO A POTENTIAL WAY TO THINK

01:14:03.238 --> 01:14:05.774
ABOUT THE NUMBERS AND HOW HOW

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:06.375
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE WERE TALKING

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.176
ABOUT IT.

BY CATEGORY.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.048
ITHINK THE THE BACKGROUND --

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.516
KIND OF OUTLINED --

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.018

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.192
THAT I OFTEN LOOK AT IT IS HOW

01:14:23.258 --> 01:14:24.927

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:38.086
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO TALK

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:39.154

ACCESSIBLE IS ONE THE MOST

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:43.792
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS THAT THE

CREATE A YOUTH CENTER PROCESS.

01:18:06.615 --> 01:18:07.849

CONNECTIONS HEALTH AND WELLNESS

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:22.464
AND MENTAL HEALTH TODAY I THINK

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:23.532
WE CAN ASK OURSELVES ABOUT THE

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.133
LANGUAGE WERE USING AND HOW WE

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.935
TALK ABOUT THIS POPULATION WE

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:28.570
CAN CALL THESE PLACEMENT CHANGES

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:29.971
OR WE CAN CALL THEM LIFE

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.239
DISRUPTIONS.

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:32.541
TODAY WILL FOCUS ON THE LAST

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:33.775
PILLAR THAT MY MEMBERS HAVE

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.278
ELEVATED AND HIGHLY OUR MEMBERS

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:38.013
THOUGHT SENTIMENTS AND

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.015
RECOMMENDATIONS BOTH BROADLY AND

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:41.416
IN REGARDS TO PRESUMPTIVE

01:18:41.483 --> 01:18:43.151
TRANSFER.

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:44.419
WHEN MY MEMBERS WHO HAVE LIVED

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:46.021
EXPERIENCE TALK ABOUT MENTAL

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.889
HEALTH AND WELLNESS STORIES THAT

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:50.158
MISDIAGNOSES OVER MEDICATION

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.960
ABSENT CARE GIVERS AND

01:18:52.027 --> 01:18:53.095
LONELINESS ARE THEMES THAT

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.230
QUICKLY EMERGE?

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:56.164
AND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.300
SOLUTIONS THINGS SUCH AS SYSTEM

01:18:58.366 --> 01:19:00.302
CORONATION SOMEONE TO BE ON

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.571
THEIR SIDE BETTER SERVICES THAT

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:03.872
ARE NOT TYPICAL CLINICAL

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:06.241
APPROACHES SUCH AS ART THERAPY

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.943
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES

01:19:08.009 --> 01:19:11.213
SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ANIMALS --

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:12.747
THOSE THEMES EMERGE TO JUST AS

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:13.548
QUICKLY.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:15.550
THEY'VE EVEN COINED A NEW TERM

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:18.220
CALLED THERAPISTS OF ORIGIN FOR

01:19:18.286 --> 01:19:21.123
CONTINUITY IN SERVICES.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.290
AND THE SENTIMENT ALWAYS ENDS UP

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:23.325
BEING.

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:24.926

SAYING.

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:33.969
YET WE KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM OF

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:35.437
DELIVERY IS INCREDIBLY

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.405
BUREAUCRATIC IT'S HARD TO

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.774
NAVIGATE AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS AS

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:40.976

PORTION OF YOUNG FOSTER LEADERS.

AT THE FOSTER LEADERS THAT I

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.919
SUPPORT TELL ME OF THEIR EXTREME

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:26.154
SOCIAL ANXIETY BEING FORCED TO

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.156
TAKE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS AS

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.424
YOUNG AS AGE.

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:30.458
TEN LONELINESS ISOLATION AND

01:20:30.525 --> 01:20:33.461
HOPELESS HOW THEIR MENTAL HEALTH

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.297
AND TRAUMA PREVENTED THEM FROM

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:36.965
HAVING SUCCESSFUL PLACEMENTS AND

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.000
LIFELONG CONNECTIONS PLACEMENTS

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:40.468
AND PEOPLE THEY WISH WERE STILL

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.904
IN THEIR LIVES BUT WEREN'T

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.873
EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT THEM.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.507
MENTAL HEALTH HAS EVEN BECAUSE

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:46.741
SOME YOUNG PARENTS TO HAVE THEIR

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.810
OWN CHILDREN BE INVOLVED IN THE

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:50.412
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

01:20:50.478 --> 01:20:52.147
THESE CHALLENGES INCREASE WHEN

01:20:52.214 --> 01:20:53.315
THEY ARE REMOVED FROM THEIR

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:54.583
COMMUNITIES OF ORIGIN.

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:56.184
THERE'S AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.053
YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR RURAL

01:20:58.119 --> 01:21:00.288
COUNTIES THAT ARE PLACED OUTSIDE

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:01.990
DUE TO THE LACK OF ADEQUATE

01:21:02.057 --> 01:21:02.958
FOSTER HOMES.

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.859
ISN'T ENOUGH.

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:06.161
THE EXPERIENCE CHANGES IN

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.263
PROVIDERS.

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:09.898
THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR

01:21:09.965 --> 01:21:12.033
NATURAL SUPPORTS AND THAT

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.502
CONSTANT DISRUPTIONS EXTREMELY

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:16.071
TRAUMATIZING BUILDING UPON THE

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.505
TRAUMA THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:19.374
EXPERIENCE AND CAUSE THEM TO

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:22.110
ENTER THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM.

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.778
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME A

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.247
GOING MONTHS WITHOUT MEDICAL

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.749
SERVICES AFTER PLACEMENT CHANGE

01:21:27.816 --> 01:21:30.151
AND A LACK OF ADEQUATE PLANNING

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.386
TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THEIR

01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:32.821
WELLNESS NEEDS MATT.

01:21:32.887 --> 01:21:33.888
ADDITIONALLY MY YOUNG LEADER

01:21:33.955 --> 01:21:35.690
STATE THAT A LACK OF CONNECTION

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:38.426
ISN'T SOMETHING THAT IS ABLE TO

01:21:38.493 --> 01:21:39.394
BE MET WITH THERAPY.

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.496
THERE ARE VERY FEW THERAPEUTIC

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.365
FOSTER HOMES AND ASK YOUR TWO

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.533
PEAS IN RURAL COUNTIES THERE ARE

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.302
NONE IN MY COMMUNITY AND WE DO

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:48.970
NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.472
BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT

01:21:50.538 --> 01:21:51.906
FOSTER YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.475
AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE FORCED

01:21:53.541 --> 01:21:54.743
TO LEAVE THEIR COMMUNITIES OF

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:55.744
ORIGIN.

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.245
WE NEED STRONGER COORDINATION OF

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:59.447
CARE AND FUNDING FOR RESOURCE

01:21:59.514 --> 01:22:01.216
POOR AREAS OF CALIFORNIA SUCH AS

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:03.018
MINE TO ENSURE THAT OUR YOUNG

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:05.253
PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO BE REMOVED

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:09.291
FROM OUR COMMUNITY IS.

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.326
IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO POINT TO

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:12.360

BACKGROUND SHE I'M PRETTY

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:16.765
FAMILIAR WITH THE SETTLEMENT

01:22:16.831 --> 01:22:18.333
BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY

01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:21.403
FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL YEARS --

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.605
AND THE PRIOR PRIORITIES INCLUDE

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.006

SCANNED RATHER QUICKLY BEING

01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:33.782
SEMI FAMILIAR WITH IT --

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.583
WHEN I DID SOMETHING JUMPED OUT

01:22:35.650 --> 01:22:38.553

01:22:44.926 --> 01:22:46.461
THIS NUMBER STOOD OUT NOW

01:22:46.528 --> 01:22:50.098
BECAUSE OF RIDLEY ALARMING BUT

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:51.833
HEALTH FAMILIAR WAS --

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.335
BOTH CALLIN NICER BUT IN

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:55.136
ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THAT IS NOT

01:22:55.203 --> 01:22:57.539
UNCOMMON TO THIS VERY DAY WILL

WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE WITH

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:07.449
IS THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE?

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:09.484

01:30:57.485 --> 01:30:58.786
COUNTY AND USUALLY THAT'S

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.055
RELATED AS MR ROSE SAID.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.858
THE SERVICE NEED LEVEL ISN'T

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:05.927

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.397
THAT SUFFICIENT RESIDENTIAL

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:10.932

THE PLACEMENT IS APPROPRIATE AND

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:35.590
HELPFUL AS POSSIBLE AND TO AVOID.

01:31:35.656 --> 01:31:37.058
MULTIPLE PLACEMENTS SO THAT'S

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:39.126

01:31:46.367 --> 01:31:47.535

PLACE IT DETERMINES THEIR TO AN

01:31:53.975 --> 01:31:57.845

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:06.520
THE NEEDS IF IT'S THAT THE NEED

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:09.190

01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:10.524
GROUP HOME.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.193
AND NOW --

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.762
ESSERE TP A SHORT TERM THERAPY

01:32:14.829 --> 01:32:16.631

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:22.770
FOR THAT I'M THE MIDDLE HEALTH

01:32:22.837 --> 01:32:25.206
PLAN WILL DO AN ASSESSMENT TO

01:32:25.273 --> 01:32:26.741

ASSESSED FOR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS.

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:32.446
AND THEN.

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:34.215
THERE WILL BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:32:34.282 --> 01:32:35.483
WHETHER PERCENT OF TRANSFERS

RECOMMENDATION THAT IS MADE AND

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.904
THAT IS SOMETHING AS A TREATING

01:32:56.971 --> 01:32:58.606
AGENCY THAT IT'S BEEN A CONCERN

01:32:58.673 --> 01:33:00.241
OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THAT

HAS BEEN EXPRESSED IN OTHER

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:01.976
SETTINGS.

01:33:02.043 --> 01:33:02.877
BUT I WANT TO MENTION THAT

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:07.081
BECAUSE AS THE RESPONSIBLE --

01:33:07.148 --> 01:33:08.749

WE CURRENTLY ARE ABLE.

01:33:21.329 --> 01:33:23.597
TO SO IF THE CHILD IS PLACED OUT

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:26.867
OF COUNTY THEN THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:28.536

TRANSFERRED THEN THE HOST MENTAL

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:34.475
HEALTH PLAN HAS RESPONSIBILITY

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:37.011
TO RANGE FOR AND PROVIDE.

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:39.046
FOR THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.281

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.916
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:33:43.017 --> 01:33:43.751
TALKING ABOUT.

01:33:43.818 --> 01:33:45.486
AND SO.

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:46.687
I'M THEY RECEIVE THEIR

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:49.357
RESPONSIBILITY PRIOR TO SERVICES

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.525
IT'S SO IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:53.794
SERVICES AS WAS MENTIONED IS A

01:33:53.861 --> 01:33:55.730
PART OF HEALTH SERVICES.

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:57.565
AND SO BEFORE SERVICES CAN BE

01:33:57.631 --> 01:34:00.501

MENTAL HEALTH IS A PART OF

HEALTH SERVICES NEEDS TO BE GAME

01:34:07.141 --> 01:34:08.609
AN ASSESSMENT WHICH HOPEFULLY

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:10.144
HAS BEEN DONE ALREADY.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:12.079
NEEDS TO THE HOST MENTAL HEALTH

01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:13.414
PLAN IS TO RECEIVE AN

01:34:13.481 --> 01:34:14.949
AUTHORIZATION NEEDS TO BE GIVEN

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.717
AGAIN AS IT WOULD IN ANY HEALTH

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:17.852
SERVICE.

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:19.353
WHETHER YOU NEED SURGERY OR WITH

ALWAYS WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE

01:34:31.599 --> 01:34:34.168
COURT APPROVED JB TO TWENTY FORM

01:34:34.235 --> 01:34:35.636
WHICH BASICALLY ALLOWS.

01:34:35.703 --> 01:34:39.473
IF IF MEDICATIONS ARE PRESCRIBED

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:40.174
REST.

01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:41.575
AND SO THOSE ARE SOME DOCUMENTS

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.477
THAT ARE VERY CRITICAL BEFORE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:45.246
SERVICES CAN REALLY BEGIN.

01:34:45.312 --> 01:34:47.882
AND THEN THE PRACTITIONER WHO'S

01:34:47.948 --> 01:34:48.516
GOING TO WORK WITH THE CHILD OR

01:34:48.582 --> 01:34:49.116
YOUTH.

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:50.351
WORKS WITH THEM TO DEVELOP A

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:52.853
CLIENT PLAN TALK ABOUT SERVICES

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.789
TALK ABOUT FREQUENCY AND SET THE

01:34:54.855 --> 01:34:56.257
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES AND SO

01:34:56.323 --> 01:34:57.925
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:34:57.992 --> 01:35:01.562
AS THE PROCESS BEGINS.

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.396
SO THEN WE GET THE CONTRACTS AND

01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:06.200
OF COURSE THERE'S MONEY INVOLVED --

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.668
AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:09.070

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:10.604
BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:13.541
IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT WHAT ARE

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:14.809

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.310
WE DEVELOP CONTRACTS AND WE

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.711
TALKED ABOUT --

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.313
THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH PLANS

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.147
THAT PROVIDE THE SERVICES

01:35:20.214 --> 01:35:22.883
DIRECTLY AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.285
MANY COUNTIES MOST COUNTIES

01:35:24.351 --> 01:35:25.786
CONTRACT OUT.

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.555
MUCH OF THEIR FOR A LARGE

01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:28.956
PORTION OF THEIR MEDI CAL

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.191
SPECIALTY MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES

01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:32.226
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE CHILDREN

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:33.427
WHO ARE IN.

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:35.996
RESIDENTIAL CARE --

IN A S. T. R. T. P. AND MANY

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.034
TIMES IN --

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:41.569
IN A FOSTER HOME AS WELL.

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:45.806
IN A RESOURCE FAMILY HOME AND SO

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:48.409
ON WE CANNOT DO THE COUNTY

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.311
MENTAL HEALTH PLAN CANNOT DO

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:52.546
THEIR SERVICES WITHOUT OUR

01:35:52.613 --> 01:35:52.813
PARTNER.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.815
THE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.251
THAT IS SO CRITICAL AND SO WE DO

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:58.986
CONTRACT WITH THEM AND SO

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.421
THERE'S A WHOLE PROCESS FOR

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:01.889
NEGOTIATING RATES.

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.524
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT COSTS THE

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.026
PROJECTION OF AMOUNT OF SERVICES

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.895
BOTH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD BUT

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:08.896
ALSO.

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.798
OVERALL IF MOST COMMONLY

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:12.399
PROVIDERS SERVE MORE THAN ONE

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:13.734
CHILD -- SO

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:14.969
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROJECTED

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.637
AMOUNT OF MINUTES AND THAT'S HOW

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:17.905
YOU COME UP WITH THE RATE.

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:20.941
AND IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THERE

01:36:21.008 --> 01:36:22.276
ARE MULTIPLE KINDS OF SERVICES

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.245
SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A RATE

01:36:24.311 --> 01:36:25.846
FOR EACH KIND OF SERVICE.

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:26.747
SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.382
CONTRACTING PROCESS IS NOT A

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:31.051
SIMPLE PROCESS AND OUR OUR

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.620
PARTNERS WILL BE PROBABLY

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:34.355
MENTIONING THAT WHEN IN THE NEXT

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:35.322
PANEL.

01:36:35.389 --> 01:36:37.558
BUT THAT'S KIND OF THE PROCESS

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:38.993
FOR DEVELOPING THE CONTRACT

01:36:39.059 --> 01:36:40.794
THERE STILL HAS TO ALL OF THE

01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:42.196
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS HAVE

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:42.997
TO GO BACK TO THE BOARD OF

01:36:43.063 --> 01:36:43.931
SUPERVISORS.

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.666
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MAKES

01:36:45.733 --> 01:36:48.235
THE DECISION AND AUTHORIZES AND

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.303
APPROVED THE CONTRACT AND SIGN

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.637
IT.

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:50.971
THERE ARE SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:52.973
ABLE TO DO --

01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:55.075
BROADER AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOWS

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.944
HIM INDIVIDUAL FLEXIBILITY ON A

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:58.646
CASE BY CASE BASIS.

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:01.115
AND SO DOES IT TO COUNTY BY

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:06.554
COUNTY DECISION AND SO AS YOU AS

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.988
IS REALLY SHOULD MENTION THERE

01:37:08.055 --> 01:37:09.790
ARE FIFTY SIX MENTAL HEALTH

01:37:09.857 --> 01:37:11.859
PLANS SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:13.394
NEGOTIATION BACK AND FORTH.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.196
AND THEN SO JUST A COMMENT ABOUT

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:17.765
FUNDING --

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:21.101
SO MENTAL HEALTH PLANS THE WAY

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:23.270
THEY'RE REIMBURSED FROM FEDERAL

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:24.972

PROVIDER IS THEIR OWN COUNTY

01:37:32.947 --> 01:37:33.914
EMPLOYEE.

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:36.250

THEY CAN SUBMIT CLAIMS FOR

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:44.058
REIMBURSEMENT SO AS YOU CAN SEE

01:37:44.124 --> 01:37:45.993
THERE'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:46.660
SOME TIME.

01:37:46.727 --> 01:37:49.230
SO FOR A CONTRACT PROVIDER IT

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.432
CAN TAKE AROUND AND THIS IS AN

01:37:51.498 --> 01:37:53.334
AVERAGE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS BY

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.903
THE TIME A CHILD SO.

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:58.639
IT THE PROCESS TAKES SOME TIME

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:01.075

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.518
DRAW DOWN THEN.

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:45.619
THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:48.455

THE STATE WILL THEN PROCESS THE

ONE THAT'S FROM THE FIRST FROM

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:18.919
THE FOR SERVICE SO THAT'S KIND

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:20.888
OF HOW THE FUNDING GOES --

01:39:20.954 --> 01:39:23.424
THE OTHER 50% COUNTY USE THE

01:39:23.490 --> 01:39:25.959
REALIGNMENT THEY RECEIVED --

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:28.762

01:39:28.829 --> 01:39:30.030
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

TWENTY ELEVEN AND THEN THERE ARE

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:32.032

RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER CC ARE.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:35.903
THERE ARE SOME PROP THIRTY

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.304
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:39.039
IN THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET THAT

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:41.075
THE COUNTIES ALSO RECEIVE SO

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:43.811
THAT'S KIND OF A REAL QUICK --

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:45.646
FINANCIAL PIECE OF THE MENTAL

01:39:45.713 --> 01:39:47.448
HEALTH COSTS AND THEN JUST A

01:39:47.514 --> 01:39:50.417
QUICK COMMENT ABOUT CHALLENGES --

01:39:50.484 --> 01:39:52.953
AS YOU CAN SEE MET BASED ON THAT

01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.722
TIME FRAME THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:57.024
PART PLANTS ARE OPERATING ON

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:58.959
PREVIOUS REVENUES THEY'RE NOT

01:39:59.026 --> 01:40:00.694
OPERATING IN THE YEAR.

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.363
THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:03.297
BASED ON THE REVENUE THEY

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.665
RECEIVE THE CAP BECAUSE THEY

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.100
HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.735
SO THAT IS JUST THE COUNTIES ARE

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:09.636
USED TO THAT BUT THAT IS THE

01:40:09.703 --> 01:40:12.072
PROCESS THINKER THE COST THERE'S

01:40:12.139 --> 01:40:13.741
A CEILINGS WITH THE GENERAL FUND

01:40:13.807 --> 01:40:15.142
THAT THEY HAVE --

01:40:15.209 --> 01:40:16.543
WORK THROUGH WITH THEIR BOARD OF

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:17.745
SUPERVISORS.

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.446
AND SO THEY HAVE A BUDGET

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:20.881
CEILING SOME COUNTIES GET

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:22.249
GENERAL FUND FROM THE COUNTY

01:40:22.316 --> 01:40:23.751
SOME MENTAL HEALTH PLANS.

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:25.552
GET GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FROM

01:40:25.619 --> 01:40:29.022
THE COUNTIES SOME DO SUPERVISORS

01:40:29.089 --> 01:40:31.024
SO CASH FLOW CAN BE A CHALLENGE

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:33.227
AT TIMES AND SO THOSE THINGS AS

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.628
WE NOW LOOK AT CROSSING COUNTY

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:35.763
LINES.

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:36.764
WITH PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.399
THERE'S AN IMPACT BECAUSE NOW

01:40:38.465 --> 01:40:40.801
THERE ARE AS WE SET TALKED ABOUT

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:42.102
EARLIER THERE ARE.

01:40:42.169 --> 01:40:45.205
COUNTIES WHERE THERE ARE NO --

01:40:45.272 --> 01:40:48.008
RESIDENTIAL GROUP HOMES FOR

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:50.010
FOSTER HOMES LOCALLY AND SO KIDS

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:52.012
ARE PLACED AT A COUNTY AND SO

01:40:52.079 --> 01:40:53.280
THERE'S AN IMPACT THERE.

01:40:53.347 --> 01:40:54.681
AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:56.183
COMMENT NEVADA COUNTY WANTED TO

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.923
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER WHICH

REPRESENTS SIXTEEN COUNTIES --

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:08.562
SO THAT'S HOW MANY OF THE

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.197
COUNTIES ARE FUNCTIONING TODAY.

01:41:10.264 --> 01:41:12.332

DECREASED CONSIDERABLY.

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:54.581
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:55.649
TIMES UNFORTUNATELY WHERE

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:56.483
CHILDREN DO NEED TO BE IN

01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:59.019

FACILITY IN THEIR COUNTY AND

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:11.631

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.270
THEY CAN BE SPENDING MONEY IN

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:39.139
THE WAY THAT WE ENVISIONED WITH

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:41.041
WHAT C. C. R. WAS WAS ULTIMATELY

01:49:41.107 --> 01:49:43.376

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:47.447
HAS IT IS JELLING IN THE WAY OR

01:49:47.514 --> 01:49:50.617
AS QUICKLY AS WE HAD INTENDED

01:49:50.684 --> 01:49:52.285
UNDER CC ARE SO THAT'S A PIECE

01:49:52.352 --> 01:49:53.820
THAT I THINK WE ABSOLUTELY NEED

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:56.056
TO WORK ON AND IF WE CAN START

01:49:56.122 --> 01:49:58.425
TO RETHINK THE SYSTEM MAY IT'S

01:49:58.491 --> 01:49:59.326
OF THE KIDS.

01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:01.461
THEN WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB IN

01:50:01.528 --> 01:50:03.196
SOME OF THE MORE RURAL AREAS

01:50:03.263 --> 01:50:03.630
WHERE THERE HAVEN'T

01:50:03.697 --> 01:50:04.497
TRADITIONALLY BAD.

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:06.466
BAD AS MUCH SUPPORTS.

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.234
AND YOU KNOW THE COMMENTS THAT.

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:09.402

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:14.341
NOT GOOD FOR KIDS.

01:50:14.407 --> 01:50:16.476
THAT'S WHY THESE HUGE PUSH AWAY

HAVING.

01:50:52.445 --> 01:50:55.215

01:50:55.281 --> 01:50:57.417
ON KIND OF A MID LEVEL KIDS AND

01:50:57.484 --> 01:50:59.652

BUT I WOULD ASK THAT WE REALLY

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.808

THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:42.695
TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THAT.

01:51:42.762 --> 01:51:45.565
THE RED TAPE THE THE OLD WAYS OF

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:48.935

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:57.770
KID.

01:57:57.837 --> 01:58:00.540
AS THEY GROW INTO ADULTHOOD JUST

01:58:00.606 --> 01:58:02.475

QUESTION WHAT ABOUT MENTAL

01:58:08.714 --> 01:58:10.416
HEALTH BENEFITS TO THOSE

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:15.688

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.061
SIDE OF THE TABLE THERE ARE

01:58:22.128 --> 01:58:23.129
EAGERLY AWAITING THAT BUT I

01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:23.763

PARENTS TO BELIEVE THAT THEIR

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:38.945
HEALTH PLAN.

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:40.613
THEIR PRIVATE HEALTH PLAN WILL

01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:43.082
PROVIDE --

01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:44.917

TO BECOME FOSTER PARENTS --

02:00:18.411 --> 02:00:20.680
I SPENT TWO YEARS BECOMING A

02:00:20.746 --> 02:00:22.381
FOSTER PARENT.

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:23.549
THROUGH LA COUNTY --

02:00:23.616 --> 02:00:26.018
IN OUR QUEST TO ADOPT A CHILD.

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.753
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:29.088
FRUSTRATING AND DIFFICULT

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.357
EXPERIENCE THAT I'VE EVER HAD

02:00:31.424 --> 02:00:33.626
WITH ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY --

02:00:33.693 --> 02:00:35.127
EVERY TIME WE HAD SOMEONE COME

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:36.162
TO OUR INSPECTOR HOME WHICH WAS

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:37.763
A MULTITUDE OF TIMES THEY

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:39.332
CONSTANTLY WILL COME UP WITH

02:00:39.398 --> 02:00:40.866
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN SEEMING

02:00:40.933 --> 02:00:42.802
VERY ARBITRARY --

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:44.503
REQUIREMENTS FOR US --

02:00:44.570 --> 02:00:46.439
EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE REQUIREMENTS

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:47.406
YOU KNOW THAT WOULD HAVE COST US

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:49.208
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF

02:00:49.275 --> 02:00:51.877
IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR HOME --

02:00:51.944 --> 02:00:54.413
I WAS TOLD AFTER GOING THROUGH

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.082
THAT I ASKED TOO MANY QUESTIONS

02:00:56.148 --> 02:00:57.483
AND CLEARLY I WAS NOT THE KIND

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.718
OF PERSON THAT THEY WANTED IN

02:00:58.784 --> 02:01:00.786
THEIR SYSTEM.

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:04.457
AND OF YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:05.825
DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER ADOPTION IS

02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:07.226
GOOD OR BAD BUT IT WAS BEEN MADE

02:01:07.293 --> 02:01:08.894
VERY CLEAR TO ME AT THE TIME I

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.763
AND I THINK SUBSEQUENTLY

02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:12.264
REINFORCED OVER AND OVER TO ME.

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:13.666
THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT DOES

02:01:13.733 --> 02:01:15.601
NOT VALUE ADOPTION.

02:01:15.668 --> 02:01:17.003
THAT THAT'S NOT THAT'S THE LAST

02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:18.104
RESORT AS FAR AS THEY'RE

02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:19.939
CONCERNED AND THAT MESSAGE IS

02:01:20.006 --> 02:01:21.374
GIVEN TO A POTENTIALLY ADOPTIVE

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.308
PARENTS.

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:23.643
AND YOU KNOW BEING TOLD THAT

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:24.977
YOU'RE SORT OF THE IF EVERYTHING

02:01:25.044 --> 02:01:26.212
ELSE FAILS MAYBE WILL CONSIDER

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:27.847
YOU BUT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE CARE

02:01:27.913 --> 02:01:28.981
OF THIS CHILD AND WE EXPECT YOU

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:30.282
TO LOVE THIS TRIAL BUT WE ALSO

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:31.484
EXPECT YOU.

02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:32.585
TO FAVOR UNIV NOT JUST RE

02:01:32.652 --> 02:01:33.986
INVOCATION REPLACEMENT WITH THIS

02:01:34.053 --> 02:01:35.688
FAMILY MEMBERS --

02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:36.589
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE WHETHER

02:01:36.656 --> 02:01:37.957
THAT'S GOOD FOR THE CHILD OR NOT

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.825
BUT I DEFINITELY BELIEVE IT ENDS

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.527
UP WITH A LOT OF PARENTS NOT.

02:01:41.594 --> 02:01:42.895
NOT WANTING TO GO INTO THE

02:01:42.962 --> 02:01:44.697
SYSTEM WHO WERE POTENTIALLY GOOD

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:45.398
PARENTS.

02:01:45.464 --> 02:01:47.366
A LOT OF CHILDREN BEING

02:01:47.433 --> 02:01:49.802
SEPARATED FROM PARENTS AFTER.

02:01:49.869 --> 02:01:50.936
ONE TO THREE YEARS.

02:01:51.003 --> 02:01:52.605
I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF OVER AND

02:01:52.672 --> 02:01:54.640
OVER AGAIN I'M BACK INTO THE

02:01:54.707 --> 02:01:57.009
SYSTEM.

02:01:57.076 --> 02:01:59.578
AND AGAIN I AM NOT GONNA I THIS

02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:00.846
IS NOT THE PLACE TO HAVE AN

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:01.614
ARGUMENT ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:02.982
APPROPRIATE ARE GOOD FOR THOSE

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:04.350
CHILDREN OR ANY OF THOSE ISSUES

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:05.518
AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.952
COMPLICATED AND NUANCED.

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:08.654
THERE'S LOTS OF PERSPECTIVES BUT

02:02:08.721 --> 02:02:10.723
FROM A SOMEONE WHO SPENT YEARS

02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:11.991

02:03:47.686 --> 02:03:48.354
FIVE FROM SOMEBODY INFORMING

02:03:48.420 --> 02:03:49.622
THEM THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE THIS

02:03:49.688 --> 02:03:52.958
CHILD BACK IN A SECOND COURT

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:54.860
ROOM ON TUESDAY.

02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:56.495
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING ELSEWHERE.

02:03:56.562 --> 02:03:58.497
AND TO ALL APPEARANCES IT WAS

02:03:58.564 --> 02:03:59.331
SOMEBODY THAT WAS SORT OF CARING

02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:00.966
THEIR QUEUE ON A WEDNESDAY

02:04:01.033 --> 02:04:02.868
AFTERNOON BEFORE THANKSGIVING.

02:04:02.935 --> 02:04:04.937
HAD NO IDEA THEY WERE TALKING TO

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:06.639
PEOPLE ACTUALLY BEEN CARE FOR

02:04:06.705 --> 02:04:08.407
THIS CHILD FIRST EMPEROR LOOKING

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:09.542
TO ADOPT.

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:11.443
AND WHAT MADE THE STORY STAND

02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:13.412
OUT OF MY MIND BECAUSE HE SPENT

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:14.980
THREE DAYS IN THE HAPPIEST PLACE

02:04:15.047 --> 02:04:15.881
ON EARTH.

02:04:15.948 --> 02:04:19.885
AND THAT CHILD WHO WAS WITH HIM

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:20.452
DIDN'T APPEAR IN ANY OF THE

02:04:20.519 --> 02:04:22.021
PICTURES.

02:04:22.087 --> 02:04:22.688
IF I COULD JUST WAS SO TRAUMATIC

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:23.689
FOR THEM.

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:25.157
THEY THEY STARTED EDITING RIGHT

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:27.259
AWAY -- BUT

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:30.129
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT.

02:04:30.196 --> 02:04:32.531
THE POINT I DEFINITELY THINK.

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:33.833
WE DO NEED PEOPLE.

02:04:33.899 --> 02:04:37.002

02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:38.137
ON BEHALF OF KIDS WHO WERE IN

02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:39.839
THESE.

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:41.373
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE YOU DO

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.709
NEED PEOPLE OF GOOD CARING

02:04:43.776 --> 02:04:46.345
HEARTS --

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:49.682
FOR ALL THE CRAP THAT COMES DOWN.

02:04:49.748 --> 02:04:51.250
EIGHTY A FOSTER PARENT A GOOD

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:53.552
FOSTER PARENT IS SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:04:53.619 --> 02:04:54.587
BASICALLY SAYING.

02:04:54.653 --> 02:04:56.589
THEY'RE WILLING TO TRY TO HELP A

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:58.157
CHILD GROW WHOLE.

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:00.292
IN LOVE'S OVERFLOW.

02:05:00.359 --> 02:05:01.827
BRING THAT CHILD IN THE HOUSE

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:02.661
AND SO.

02:05:02.728 --> 02:05:03.662
THEY HAVE PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:05:03.729 --> 02:05:06.532
WILLING TO BE THAT PERSON.

02:05:06.599 --> 02:05:07.533
WHO TAKE THEMSELVES OUT OF THE

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.735
SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY A GREAT

02:05:09.802 --> 02:05:13.639
DISCREDIT TO LOTS OF KIDS --

02:05:13.706 --> 02:05:16.709

PROVIDE HER FIRST PERSON ACCOUNT

02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:19.678
BUT I CERTAINLY.

02:05:19.745 --> 02:05:21.380
HEAR HEAR THOSE STORIES SOME

02:05:21.447 --> 02:05:23.015
PEOPLE MYSELF.

02:05:23.082 --> 02:05:23.816
ARE I ACTUALLY JUST WANTED TO

02:05:23.883 --> 02:05:25.317
SAY.

02:05:25.384 --> 02:05:27.386
I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR CALIFORNIA --

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:28.888
BEING HERE.

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:30.422
I THINK IN THIS WHOLE SYSTEM THE

02:05:30.489 --> 02:05:33.225
THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD ASK IS.

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:34.727
TO WHAT EXTENT HAVE WE IN A

02:05:34.793 --> 02:05:36.528
SYSTEMATIC WAY.

02:05:36.595 --> 02:05:39.632
OR CAN WE IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.

02:05:39.698 --> 02:05:42.935
IN SOME OF THESE RURAL COUNTIES.

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:45.871
FIND A WAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:47.640
TWO STRUPPER CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:05:47.706 --> 02:05:49.441
WHAT TO THE LOCAL INS LOOKS LIKE

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:51.076
THE THINGS THAT.

02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:53.345
IF YOU'RE IN MODOC COUNTY OR

02:05:53.412 --> 02:05:54.914
TAME A COUNTY OR DEL NORTE

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:55.948
COUNTY.

02:05:56.015 --> 02:05:58.651
WHAT TO THE LOCALS WHO HAVE A

02:05:58.717 --> 02:06:00.119
CONCERN IN THIS AREA WHO BE SORT

02:06:00.185 --> 02:06:01.887
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WANT?

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:04.356

LOVES OVER FOR THE TYPE OF

02:06:04.957 --> 02:06:07.326
PERSON.

02:06:07.393 --> 02:06:08.494
WHAT DID THEY SEE IS THE THING

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.361
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT THEY

02:06:09.428 --> 02:06:11.096
COULD DO MOST DIRECTLY? TO HELP

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.765
SOLVE THE IMPLEMENTATION SOME

02:06:12.831 --> 02:06:14.166
THESE PROGRAMS.

02:06:14.233 --> 02:06:14.867
I THINK --

02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:17.002
MY COLLEAGUE MISTER STONE HAS

02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.870
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

02:06:17.937 --> 02:06:18.170
[inaudible]

02:06:18.237 --> 02:06:21.440
KIND OF FRAME THIS CONVERSATION

02:06:21.507 --> 02:06:22.875
WERE SPENDING YEARS WORKING TO

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.643
IMPLEMENT IT.

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:26.679
BRING IT DOWN THE COUNTY LEVEL.

02:06:26.745 --> 02:06:27.846
AND IT'S GREAT FOR US IN

02:06:27.913 --> 02:06:29.014
SACRAMENTO KINDA CONCEIVE OF

02:06:29.081 --> 02:06:30.516
THESE THINGS AND AND TRY TO ROLL

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:32.184
THEM OUT.

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.619
BUT I AM REMINDED THAT THE END

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:35.587
OF THE DAY WE NEED TO RELEASE

02:06:35.654 --> 02:06:37.156
ENERGY.

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:38.424
IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ON

02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:40.125
THESE PROBLEMS.

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:42.127
AND THAT MEANS YOU HAVE.

02:06:42.194 --> 02:06:43.462
TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND KIND OF

02:06:43.529 --> 02:06:45.898
UNDERSTAND WHERE THAT ENERGY IS.

02:06:45.965 --> 02:06:48.667
AND I I'LL GIVE A SHOUT OUT --

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:50.602
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO I WORKED

02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:53.038
ON A BILL AUTHORED BY LOU PAP

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:55.407
BUT WHICH WAS THE FIRST BILL

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.509
DEAL WITH CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION.

02:06:57.576 --> 02:06:59.712
WHICH CONCEIVE OF PUTTING.

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:01.747
A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AND ALL

02:07:01.814 --> 02:07:03.382
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SUPPORT

02:07:03.449 --> 02:07:04.817
OF LOCAL CONVERSATION.

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:07.219
ON WHAT MIGHT MAKE SENSE AT THAT

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:08.554
LOCAL LEVEL TO DO A CHILD ABUSE

02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:09.521
PREVENTION.

02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:12.358
SO IS NOT A CASE OF SURPLUS AND

02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:13.792
THIS IS HOW YOU'LL DO IT.

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:14.960
IT WAS A CASE OF SACRAMENTO

02:07:15.027 --> 02:07:16.662
PUTTING RESOURCES INTO SUPPORT A

02:07:16.729 --> 02:07:18.831
CONVERSATION ABOUT WE THINK THIS

02:07:18.897 --> 02:07:19.999
IS AN ISSUE.

02:07:20.065 --> 02:07:21.600
WHAT MAKES SENSE TO LOCALLY ON

02:07:21.667 --> 02:07:24.103
HOW TO TACKLE THAT?

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.771
IT'S SORT OF WITHIN AS WE AS WE

02:07:25.838 --> 02:07:29.408
WORK ON THIS SYSTEM OF REFORMS.

02:07:29.475 --> 02:07:31.477
AND TRYING TO SUPPORT.

02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:33.679
THE TRANSFER ACROSS COUNTY

02:07:33.746 --> 02:07:35.014
BOUNDARIES WHERE THAT'S GOING TO

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.015
HELP A CHILD.

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:38.283
HOW DO WE GET ACROSS AT COUNTY

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.451
LINE AND HAVE THE MOST

02:07:39.518 --> 02:07:42.354
HOSPITABLE IMPLEMENTATION?

02:07:53.298 --> 02:07:56.902
BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT.

02:07:56.969 --> 02:07:58.771
WE NEED TO TAP INTO WHAT'S GOING

02:07:58.837 --> 02:08:00.839

WHAT WE ARE SEEING WHAT WE WERE

02:19:43.975 --> 02:19:45.610
HOPEFUL THAT WE'VE --

02:19:45.677 --> 02:19:47.946
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSPORTING PLACE A

02:19:48.012 --> 02:19:49.547
WEEK COULD ACTUALLY LIMIT THE

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.049
NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS WE'VE

02:19:51.116 --> 02:19:52.984
COUNTIES BECAUSE AS YOU CAN

02:19:53.051 --> 02:19:55.019
IMAGINE EACH CONTRACT COMES WITH

02:19:55.086 --> 02:19:56.855
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS REPORTING

REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTATION

02:19:59.157 --> 02:20:00.325
REQUIREMENTS TO SO WE WERE

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:00.925

02:20:00.992 --> 02:20:02.427
THINKING THAT A PRESUMPTIVE

02:20:06.331 --> 02:20:08.266
THESE PROCESSES WHILE WE'VE

02:20:08.333 --> 02:20:10.235
EXPERIENCED ACTUALLY IS THE

02:20:10.301 --> 02:20:11.603
OPPOSITE THAT --

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:14.439
WE ARE SEEING MORE COMPLICATION

02:20:14.506 --> 02:20:17.876
MORE DOCUMENTATION AND THAT WE

02:20:17.942 --> 02:20:19.978
ARE IN NOW --

02:20:20.044 --> 02:20:21.913
NOT ALWAYS COMFORTABLE PLACE

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:24.682
SELF TRYING TO MEDIATE BETWEEN

02:20:24.749 --> 02:20:26.618
PLACING COUNTY AND RECEIVING

02:20:26.684 --> 02:20:28.219
COUNTY -- TO

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:29.621
MAKE SURE THAT THE PAPERWORK IS

02:20:29.687 --> 02:20:36.227
IN PLACE SO THAT WE CAN --

02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:39.430
RECEIVE THE CHILD AND STUFF OF

02:20:39.497 --> 02:20:40.265
THE REQUIREMENTS OF A C. R. T.

02:20:40.331 --> 02:20:42.600
P. AND ONE OF THE PURPOSES FOR

02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:43.968
REST THE RTP.

02:20:44.035 --> 02:20:46.137
IS OF COURSE THESE KIDS COME IN

02:20:46.204 --> 02:20:49.140
WITH VERY HIGH INTENSITY NEEDS

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.609
AND A VERY SHORT STAY AND WE

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:53.244
WANT TO WE ARE COMMITTED TO

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:55.079
MAINTAINING THAT --

02:20:55.146 --> 02:20:57.348
STAY AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE

02:20:57.415 --> 02:20:59.217
BECAUSE WE REALLY TRULY BELIEVE

02:20:59.284 --> 02:21:00.985
THAT KIDS NEED TO BE SERVED IN

02:21:01.052 --> 02:21:04.222
THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY ARE --

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:06.724
CONGREGATE THEY CARE IS GOOD FOR

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:09.027
SOME THINGS BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY

02:21:09.093 --> 02:21:12.030
THE NORMALIZED PLACEMENT

02:21:12.096 --> 02:21:14.532
EXPERIENCE THAT YOU WANT TO TRY

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:15.200
TO HAVE.

02:21:15.266 --> 02:21:17.335
SO WE SEE OURSELVES AS KIND OF

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.937
LIKE THE EQUIVALENT OF A NICE

02:21:19.003 --> 02:21:21.139
YOU RIGHT YOU GO TO THE I SEE

02:21:21.206 --> 02:21:22.373

02:21:23.474 --> 02:21:25.310
THAT -- STAY

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:27.245
IN THE I SEE YOU ALLOWS YOU TO

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:29.280
NOT BE AS A CUE TO WHICH DOESN'T

02:21:29.347 --> 02:21:31.549
MEAN YOUR FIXED BY YOU ARE WELL

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:33.451
ENOUGH TO BE THREE DEAD.

02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:39.090
AT AT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW AT

02:21:39.157 --> 02:21:41.860
A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF HEALTH CARE.

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:45.663
STILL OUR HOPIS THE READ THAT

02:21:45.730 --> 02:21:48.766
DAVIES STREAMLINING OFF THIS

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:51.202
PROCESS IS SO THAT --

02:21:51.269 --> 02:21:53.037
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE ON A

02:21:53.104 --> 02:21:54.606

02:22:00.678 --> 02:22:02.080
WAS THE RIGHT NOW WHILE WE ARE

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:04.048
SEEING IS --

02:22:04.115 --> 02:22:07.585
ED ENOCH QUEST THE FOR PAPER

02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:09.287

INTAKE.

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:16.160
AND ALSO WE ARE SEEING DENIALS

02:22:16.227 --> 02:22:19.497

02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:28.172
THIS IS COMPLICATING THAT --

02:22:28.239 --> 02:22:30.375
THAT PROCESS A LITTLE BIT OF

02:22:30.441 --> 02:22:32.644
FUNDING IS ALSO A NEED TO AS

TO FIVE TO SIX KIDS TOP OF THAT --

02:22:59.904 --> 02:23:02.840
THAT THAT COUNTY WAS PREVIOUSLY

02:23:02.907 --> 02:23:04.876
RESPONSIBLE FOR FROM PAYMENT

02:23:04.943 --> 02:23:06.110
STANDPOINT AND WHAT THAT MEANS

02:23:06.177 --> 02:23:07.912
IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE A CONTRACT

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:09.881
A CONTRACT ALSO ESTABLISHES THE

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:11.182
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS

02:23:11.249 --> 02:23:12.216
AVAILABLE.

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.419
AND THEREFORE WHEN --

02:23:14.485 --> 02:23:16.120
OF COURSE WITH THE INCREASE THE

02:23:16.187 --> 02:23:18.189
NUMBER OF OF KIDS BEING PLACE

02:23:18.256 --> 02:23:21.092
THAT ARE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFERS --

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:23.461
WE ARE IN A POSITION OF NEEDING

02:23:23.528 --> 02:23:25.630
TO REQUIRE ANY A SIGNIFICANT

02:23:25.697 --> 02:23:26.898
INCREASE SOMETIMES OF THE

02:23:26.965 --> 02:23:28.533
FUNDING NECESSARY FOR US TO

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:29.634
CONTINUE.

02:23:29.701 --> 02:23:38.810
TO OPERATE UNDER THAT CONTRACT.

02:23:38.876 --> 02:23:41.412

COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS

02:23:46.050 --> 02:23:47.385
ASSOCIATION I WANT TO TALK A

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:48.953
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT

02:23:49.020 --> 02:23:50.688
SEE WTA PLAYED IN TWELVE NINETY

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:51.322
NINE AND GIVE SOME THOUGHTS ON

02:23:51.389 --> 02:23:52.256
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER.

02:23:52.323 --> 02:23:53.257
AND TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THEMES

02:23:53.324 --> 02:23:54.359
THAT WE'RE SEEING AND HEARING

02:23:54.425 --> 02:23:55.994
ABOUT FROM COUNTIES I KNOW IT'S

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:57.128
SORT OF THE LAST RABBIT PANEL

02:23:57.195 --> 02:23:59.030
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY PROVIDE SOME

02:23:59.097 --> 02:24:00.565
SUGGESTIONS AS WELL SO I WANT.

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:01.766
TO TRY TO I'LL TRY NOT TO GET

02:24:01.833 --> 02:24:02.233
TOO MUCH INTO THAT --

02:24:02.300 --> 02:24:03.468
AT THE MOMENT.

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:07.338
SO AS FAR AS FOUR YEARS AGO --

02:24:07.405 --> 02:24:08.940
AS NOTED IN THE MATERIALS IN THE

02:24:09.007 --> 02:24:10.475
BACKGROUND PAPER IT WAS CLEAR WE

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:12.577
WERE ENGAGED FOR MANY YEARS AND

02:24:12.643 --> 02:24:14.212
THIS LONG STANDING ISSUE IT WAS

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:16.080
FRUSTRATING. TO NOT BE ABLE TO

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:18.149
GET OUR YOUTH AND CHILDREN THAT

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.884
WE PLACE OUT OF COUNTY --

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.252
FOR THE REASONS THAT MISTER ROSE

02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:23.221
NOTED IN HIS TESTIMONY --

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:24.455
THOSE SERVICES AS QUICKLY AS

02:24:24.522 --> 02:24:26.457
POSSIBLE AND FOR THERE TO BE

02:24:26.524 --> 02:24:27.792
CONFUSION ABOUT WHO WAS

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:29.360
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT AND NOT A

02:24:29.427 --> 02:24:30.928
LOT OF CONSISTENCY THERE.

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:32.663
SO WE WORKED WITH THE OTHER

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:33.798
STAKEHOLDERS IN WITH THE TWO

02:24:33.865 --> 02:24:36.200
SPONSORS TO HELP IN DRAFTING THE

02:24:36.267 --> 02:24:37.802
FINAL BILL WHICH WE WERE ABLE TO

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:38.836
SUPPORT.

02:24:38.903 --> 02:24:40.138
AND WE DID SUPPORT THE

02:24:40.204 --> 02:24:41.506
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER AS WELL.

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:43.408
WE SUPPORTED IT BECAUSE WE

02:24:43.474 --> 02:24:45.610
REALLY NEEDED THAT CLARIFICATION

02:24:45.676 --> 02:24:46.978
BUT WE ALSO FELT THAT IT WAS

02:24:47.045 --> 02:24:48.279
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT ABILITY

02:24:48.346 --> 02:24:49.614
TO WAIVE THAT IN CERTAIN

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:51.449
CIRCUMSTANCES AND MR CHARTER

02:24:51.516 --> 02:24:52.450
EXPLAINED A LITTLE BIT OF THIS

02:24:52.517 --> 02:24:54.018
BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:24:54.085 --> 02:24:55.353
WOULD LOOK AT OUR THE STABILITY

02:24:55.420 --> 02:24:56.521
OF THE THERAPEUTIC.

02:24:56.587 --> 02:24:57.522
RELATIONSHIP THAT THAT YOU THIS

02:24:57.588 --> 02:24:59.057
ALREADY FORMED IF THEY'RE

02:24:59.123 --> 02:25:00.591
RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:01.492
SERVICES IN THEIR EXISTING

02:25:01.559 --> 02:25:03.561
COUNTY --

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:04.195
AND IF YOU COULD MAINTAIN THOSE

02:25:04.262 --> 02:25:07.098
AND IT WAS ABOUT THE BAY AREA OR

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.900
IT MIGHT NOT BE THAT LONG ACROSS

02:25:08.966 --> 02:25:11.102
COUNTY LINES [inaudible]

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:14.072
HAS OR OF OTHER SORT OF

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:16.007
NONTRADITIONAL SERVICES AS MS

02:25:16.074 --> 02:25:17.208
HERNANDEZ NOTED ON THE FIRST

02:25:17.275 --> 02:25:19.243
PANEL SUCH AS ART THERAPY ONCE

02:25:19.310 --> 02:25:20.111
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GREAT

02:25:20.178 --> 02:25:21.579
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED YOU

02:25:21.646 --> 02:25:22.680
WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOU

02:25:22.747 --> 02:25:23.781
SHOULD --

02:25:23.848 --> 02:25:25.249
POTENTIALLY SEVER THAT EVEN FOR

02:25:25.316 --> 02:25:26.951
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THE

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:28.252
YOUTH IS IN THAT --

02:25:28.319 --> 02:25:30.588
I S. T. R. T. P. OR PLACED WITH

02:25:30.655 --> 02:25:32.790
A RELATIVE OUT OF COUNTY --

02:25:32.857 --> 02:25:35.326
SO THE ABILITY ALSO FOR THE HOST

02:25:35.393 --> 02:25:36.627
COUNTY -- OR

02:25:36.694 --> 02:25:37.662
FOR THE PLACING COUNTY TO BE

02:25:37.728 --> 02:25:39.464
ABLE TO DO A CONTRACT WITH THE

02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:41.499
PROVIDER WHO'S IN THE COUNTY

02:25:41.566 --> 02:25:42.934
THAT AT THE YOUTH IS LIVING IN

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:44.936
WAS ALSO A CONSIDERATION AS WELL

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:45.837
IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A

02:25:45.903 --> 02:25:47.071
RELATIONSHIP AND THEY CAN JUST

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:48.506
EXPAND THAT CONTRACT.

02:25:48.573 --> 02:25:50.208
THATMAKES A LOT OF SENSE IF

02:25:50.274 --> 02:25:51.342
IT'S BRAND NEW THERE'S NO

02:25:51.409 --> 02:25:52.577
CONTRACT THERE'S NO EXISTING

02:25:52.643 --> 02:25:53.511
RELATIONSHIP.

02:25:53.578 --> 02:25:55.046
PERHAPS BETTER THAN TO ALLOW

02:25:55.113 --> 02:25:55.947
THAT PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER TO

02:25:56.013 --> 02:25:58.049
OCCUR AND HAVE THAT CONTRACT IS

02:25:58.116 --> 02:26:01.385
PICKED UP BY THE COUNTY --

02:26:01.452 --> 02:26:02.687
OF PLACEMENT.

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:03.588
WE ALSO FELT IT WAS VERY

02:26:03.654 --> 02:26:04.755
IMPORTANT FOR THE COUNTY SOCIAL

02:26:04.822 --> 02:26:06.657
WORKER THE PLACING AGENCY TO BE

02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:07.892
MAKING ALTERNATELY THAT

02:26:07.959 --> 02:26:10.027
DETERMINATION WITH INPUT FROM

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:12.130
OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WITH INPUT

02:26:12.196 --> 02:26:13.731
FROM THE CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM.

02:26:13.798 --> 02:26:14.765
BUT ULTIMATELY WERE THE ONES

02:26:14.832 --> 02:26:16.601
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CARE CUSTODY

02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.436
AND CONTROL OF THAT YOUTH AND WE

02:26:18.503 --> 02:26:19.804
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SORT OF

02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:22.406
VAST THAT DECISION ULTIMATELY

02:26:22.473 --> 02:26:24.008
WITH THAT COUNTY SOCIAL WORKER.

02:26:24.075 --> 02:26:25.409
ON AND FINALLY I DO WANT TO SAY

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.311
AND REMIND US THAT THE WE'RE

02:26:27.378 --> 02:26:28.679
TALKING A LOT ABOUT THE S. T. R.

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:29.914
T. P..

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:31.616
AND GROUP HOME RELATED ISSUES

02:26:31.682 --> 02:26:33.284
THIS APPLIES TO ALL CHILDREN AND

02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:34.285
YOUTH AND MUCH OF OUR

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:36.220
CONVERSATION IN THE ORIGINAL

02:26:36.287 --> 02:26:38.289
ORIGINAL LEGISLATION THOUGHT

02:26:38.356 --> 02:26:39.690
ABOUT THOSE PLACES WITH RELATIVE

02:26:39.757 --> 02:26:40.892
CARE GIVERS WHO MIGHT LIVE

02:26:40.958 --> 02:26:42.160
ACROSS COUNTY LINES.

02:26:42.226 --> 02:26:43.461
WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:45.062
NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND HOW CAN

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.631
WE MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

02:26:46.697 --> 02:26:48.466
FOR THEM TO RECEIVE SERVICES SO

02:26:48.533 --> 02:26:49.534
THAT ISSUES I THINK ARE MORE

02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:50.968
ACUTE AND WE'RE TALKING MORE

02:26:51.035 --> 02:26:52.069
ABOUT THEM WITH THE?

02:26:52.136 --> 02:26:53.804
CONGREGATE FACILITIES BUT I DO

02:26:53.871 --> 02:26:54.972
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:26:55.039 --> 02:26:56.274
NOTE THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES

02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:58.009
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER FOR OUR

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.343
RELATIVE CAREGIVERS ANOTHER

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:01.746
FOSTER PARENTS RESOURCE FAMILIES

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:03.147
WITHIN THESE CHILDREN ARE PLACED.

02:27:03.214 --> 02:27:04.715
SO SOME OF THE THEMES THAT WERE

02:27:04.782 --> 02:27:06.117
HEARING I THINK KIND OF CLOSER

02:27:06.184 --> 02:27:08.319
TO TWO AREAS ONE IS COMPLEXITY

02:27:08.386 --> 02:27:09.654
AND YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:11.055
DIFFERENT CONTRACTS ACROSS

02:27:11.122 --> 02:27:12.857
DIFFERENT COUNTY LINES WHEN

02:27:12.924 --> 02:27:14.292
WE'RE PLACING FROM ONE COUNTY TO

02:27:14.358 --> 02:27:15.593
ANOTHER.

02:27:15.660 --> 02:27:17.628
JUST EVEN THE FORMS ARE

02:27:17.695 --> 02:27:20.665
DIFFERENT CONSENT FOR THEY

02:27:20.731 --> 02:27:22.166
DIFFER BY COUNTIES THERE THERE'S

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:24.101
FIFTY PLUS OF THOSE AS WELL --

02:27:24.168 --> 02:27:25.469
THE CONTRACTING DIFFERS BY

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:27.205
COUNTY WHAT THE CONTRACT LOOKS

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:28.773
LIKE WHAT THEY CHOOSE TO PAY FOR

02:27:28.839 --> 02:27:30.474
AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

02:27:30.541 --> 02:27:31.576
AND THEN ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:32.577
REMEMBER BECAUSE OF THE

02:27:32.643 --> 02:27:33.744
CONTINUUM OF CARE OF FORMER

02:27:33.811 --> 02:27:34.745
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT

02:27:34.812 --> 02:27:36.614
TRANSITION FROM THE OLD GROUP

02:27:36.681 --> 02:27:39.116
HOME FACILITIES INTO THESE S. T.

02:27:39.183 --> 02:27:40.418
R. T. PEAS.

02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.386
AND SO WITH A REQUIREMENT THAT

02:27:42.453 --> 02:27:43.254
THEY ALL HAVE THAT MENTAL HEALTH

02:27:43.321 --> 02:27:44.789
CONTRACT ON THERE JUST NOT A

02:27:44.855 --> 02:27:46.824
PLACE YET AND THAT CAN LEAD TO A

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:49.026
LACK OF TIMELINESS OF SERVICES.

02:27:49.093 --> 02:27:51.362
MISTER COOLEY.

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:53.231
YES MISTER COOLING JUST A VERY

02:27:53.297 --> 02:27:54.865
BRIEF QUESTION ON THIS SO AS

02:27:54.932 --> 02:27:56.234
YOUR COMMENT UPON THE

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.735
DIFFERENCES AMONG THE FIFTY

02:27:57.802 --> 02:27:58.970
EIGHT COUNTIES I MEAN THAT KIND

02:27:59.036 --> 02:28:00.204
OF IMPLIES.

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:02.373
IF YOU COULD STANDARDIZE THINGS

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:04.308
THAT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS I

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:05.676
THINK THERE COULD BE SOME

02:28:05.743 --> 02:28:06.811
STANDARDIZATION ACROSS THE

02:28:06.877 --> 02:28:08.479
THINGS I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:09.513
RIGHT NOW AND I WANT TO

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.414
ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK AT THE

02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:12.083
STATE BOTH DEPARTMENTS TO TRY TO

02:28:12.149 --> 02:28:13.618
HELP WITH THIS --

02:28:13.684 --> 02:28:15.119
THERE IS A A CLEARING HOUSE

02:28:15.186 --> 02:28:17.054
WHERE ALL OF THOSE RELEASE OF

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.990
INFORMATION CONSENT FORMS ARE

02:28:19.056 --> 02:28:20.758
BEING POSTED ON THE INTERNET SO

02:28:20.825 --> 02:28:22.893
IF THE COUNTY IS PLACING OUT OF

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:25.062
COUNTY THEY CAN GO AND PULL DOWN

02:28:25.129 --> 02:28:26.497
THAT TOOK LEASES AVAILABLE.

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:27.932
THE CONTRACTING I THINK IT'S

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:30.401
TRICKY BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE

02:28:30.468 --> 02:28:32.003
FIFTY PLUS COUNTY COUNCILS YOU

02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:33.904
HAVE THE WE'VE DONE IT THIS WAY

02:28:33.971 --> 02:28:35.172
THESE CONTRACTS WORK THERE IN

02:28:35.239 --> 02:28:36.040
PLACE.

02:28:36.107 --> 02:28:37.008
CERTAINLY I THINK MORE

02:28:37.074 --> 02:28:38.009
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE

02:28:38.075 --> 02:28:40.177
CONTRACTS AND WE'D LOVE TO WORK

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:41.412
WITH FOLKS TO SEE IF THERE ARE

02:28:41.479 --> 02:28:43.014
SOME COMMON ELEMENTS THAT COULD

02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.649
BE STANDARDIZED AND THEN MAYBE

02:28:44.715 --> 02:28:45.416
THE COUNTY.

02:28:45.483 --> 02:28:46.984
KIND OF ADS IN A FEW THINGS THAT

02:28:47.051 --> 02:28:48.185
MIGHT BE COUNTY SPECIFIC IT

02:28:48.252 --> 02:28:49.487
REGARDING --

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:51.289

PENETRATION RATES THAT WERE

02:29:35.333 --> 02:29:37.301
STILL I THINK WORKING WITH OUR

02:29:37.368 --> 02:29:38.536
PARTNERS ON BEHAVIOR HOW TO TRY

02:29:38.602 --> 02:29:40.338

INCREASE THE SERVICES THAT ARE

02:29:42.807 --> 02:29:44.342
PROVIDED TO THE YOUTH.

02:29:44.408 --> 02:29:45.176
IN ALSO --

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:46.911
INSURE THAT THE DATA ARE REALLY

THERE SO WE CAN TRACK THAT OVER

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:49.780

02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:57.688
TRANSITION.

02:29:57.755 --> 02:29:58.823
AND THEN I THINK FINALLY JUST

02:29:58.889 --> 02:30:00.791
SORT OF A CAPACITY OF PROVIDERS

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.059

TEEPEES.

02:30:03.260 --> 02:30:04.528
THERE'S SOME THERE'S MANY

02:30:04.595 --> 02:30:05.029
THEY'RE NOT MAKING THE

02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:06.630
TRANSITION FOR SOME REASON

02:30:06.697 --> 02:30:07.998
WHATEVER REASON THERE'S A NUMBER

02:30:08.065 --> 02:30:09.633
OF REASONS THAT ARE VERY

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:10.735
LEGITIMATE THEY DECIDED NOT TO

02:30:10.801 --> 02:30:11.535
DO THAT.

02:30:11.602 --> 02:30:13.003
SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:14.105
YOU KNOW RECEIVE OUR CHILDREN

02:30:14.171 --> 02:30:15.773
ANYMORE AS PLACEMENTS THERE ARE

02:30:15.840 --> 02:30:17.508
SOME WHO ARE WORKING WITHOUT

02:30:17.575 --> 02:30:18.476
WORKING WITH THE STATE TO TRY TO

02:30:18.542 --> 02:30:19.210
DO THAT.

02:30:19.276 --> 02:30:21.612
BUT WE KNOW THE STATE DOESN'T

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:22.380
BELIEVE THEY'RE GONNA MAKE IT

02:30:22.446 --> 02:30:23.881
THEY'RE SORT OF ON A LIST OF I

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:24.682
DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:25.850
ABLE TO PUT A PROGRAM TOGETHER

02:30:25.916 --> 02:30:27.051
THAT WE CAN BLAST.

02:30:27.118 --> 02:30:28.285
SO WE'RE GONNA LOSE SOME

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:29.887
CAPACITY THERE.

02:30:29.954 --> 02:30:31.455
THE THING IS CC ARE THE WHOLE

02:30:31.522 --> 02:30:33.157
POINT IS TO GET THE YOUTH OUT OF

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:34.125
THESE FACILITIES TO HAVE THESE

02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.160
BE SHORT TERM VERY THERAPEUTIC

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:38.295
AND I MEAN JUST AS DOCTOR

02:30:38.362 --> 02:30:40.464
CATALDO WAS TALKING ABOUT --

02:30:40.531 --> 02:30:41.732
YOU'RE NOT FIX NECESSARILY BUT

02:30:41.799 --> 02:30:43.000
YOU'RE TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:44.402
HELP PLACE YOU IN THE COMMUNITY

02:30:44.468 --> 02:30:46.170
WHAT WOULD REALLY RATHER DO AND

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:47.371
WHAT I THINK SEIZE HERE SUCCESS

02:30:47.438 --> 02:30:49.006
DEPENDS ON AS THE COUNTY'S

02:30:49.073 --> 02:30:50.241
ABILITY TO REALLY RECRUIT AND

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:51.575
SUPPORT FAMILIES.

02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:54.645
AND SUPPORT THEM WHERE THEY ARE

02:30:54.712 --> 02:30:56.814
RAP SERVICES ARE THOSE BEDS IN

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:59.583
THOSE THE THAT ARE MORE CALL

02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:03.187
SURE IS OKAY WE OKAY WITH THAT

02:31:03.254 --> 02:31:04.588
THE SERVICES HAVE GOT TO BE

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:05.890
THERE IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:31:05.956 --> 02:31:06.657
AND WE'RE JUST WE'RE NOT THERE

02:31:06.724 --> 02:31:07.792
YET -- I

02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:09.727
THINK MR ROSE'S POINT ABOUT THE

02:31:09.794 --> 02:31:11.429
CHILD SPECIFIC RECRUITMENT WE

02:31:11.495 --> 02:31:13.197
ARE DOING A GREAT JOB WE THINK

02:31:13.264 --> 02:31:15.032
OF FINDING RELATIVES OR OTHER ON

02:31:15.099 --> 02:31:17.568
SORT OF NON RELATED BUT EXTENDED

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:18.669
FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CAN TAKE IN

02:31:18.736 --> 02:31:19.537
THE CHILDREN.

02:31:19.603 --> 02:31:21.305
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THEN IF THAT

02:31:21.372 --> 02:31:22.940
CHILD IS REUNIFIED OR SAY THEY

02:31:23.007 --> 02:31:24.241
TAKE GUARDIANSHIP OR ADOPTION

02:31:24.308 --> 02:31:25.309
THEY DON'T TEND TO TAKE ANOTHER

02:31:25.376 --> 02:31:26.977
KID THEY'RE GOD THEY'RE NOT A

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:28.679
FOSTER HOME IN THE SENSE OF THE

02:31:28.746 --> 02:31:29.413
TRADITIONAL.

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:30.414
LICENSE TONE THAT MAY HAVE

02:31:30.481 --> 02:31:33.017
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY OVER TIME

02:31:33.083 --> 02:31:33.951
OKAY WE'VE WORKED WITH THAT

02:31:34.018 --> 02:31:35.352
YOU'D NOW WILL TAKE ANOTHER.

02:31:35.419 --> 02:31:36.654
ONE AND SO --

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:38.422
I THINK THERE WAS SOME THINKING

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.090
THAT PERHAPS THE SORT OF ODD

02:31:40.157 --> 02:31:42.126
STABILITY FUND THE FOSTER PARENT

02:31:42.193 --> 02:31:43.527

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:45.296
TIME AND THEN WE KIND OF GET

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:46.464
ENOUGH OF AND WE CAN BE DONE

02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:47.264
WITH THAT --

02:31:47.331 --> 02:31:48.566
WERE DEFINING THAT THAT'S NOT

02:31:48.632 --> 02:31:49.667

THE THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN OF

02:41:28.045 --> 02:41:29.579
THAT CAT THE THE OF THE PLACING

02:41:29.646 --> 02:41:31.314
COUNTY COORDINATE WITH SERVICES

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:32.716
IN THAT RECEIVING COUNTIES IS

02:41:32.783 --> 02:41:35.419
REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT --

02:41:35.485 --> 02:41:38.121
AND SO I I I I UNDERSTAND I IS

02:41:38.188 --> 02:41:39.956
POINT ABOUT THE THAT IT HAS

02:41:40.023 --> 02:41:41.558
WORKED OUT WELL FOR FOR YOUTH

02:41:41.625 --> 02:41:43.260
AND IN THAT --

02:41:43.326 --> 02:41:44.895
IN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS.

02:41:44.961 --> 02:41:46.563
BUT ACTUALLY IN IN TERMS THE HOW

02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:47.664
THE MONEY FLOWS WE HAD A VERY

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:49.266
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THAT WHEN

02:41:49.332 --> 02:41:50.934
WE FIRST READ THE BILL --

02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:54.504
IN WHICH IT WAS GONNA BE YOU

02:41:54.571 --> 02:41:55.739
KNOW IT WAS IT WAS KIND OF TO

02:41:55.806 --> 02:41:59.409
ENSURE THE COUNTIES THAT

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:00.877
RECEIVED AS THOSE YEARS WITH --

02:42:00.944 --> 02:42:02.279
WERE COVERED IN THE FIRST YEAR

02:42:02.345 --> 02:42:03.980
WITHIN A YEAR THAT THEY GOT THE

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.248
THE OF THAT THOSE COSTS WERE

02:42:05.315 --> 02:42:06.483
COVERED FOR THEM --

02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:07.851
SO IS IT WAS BECAUSE OF

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:09.086
POTENTIAL VETO THAT WE HAD TO

02:42:09.152 --> 02:42:10.921
CHANGE THAT AND WE KNEW THAT THE

02:42:10.987 --> 02:42:12.122
TIME WE CHANGE IT WAS GONNA BE A

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:13.523
PROBLEM AND FRANKLY WE REALLY

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:15.192
WANTED -- TO

02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:16.827
WE WANTED TO PUSH THIS ISSUE WE

02:42:16.893 --> 02:42:18.495
WANTED TO GET A FINAL RESOLUTION

02:42:18.562 --> 02:42:20.063
TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF IT UP

02:42:20.130 --> 02:42:21.731
FOR SO LONG --

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:23.300
I THINK THE THE THE LAST THING

02:42:23.366 --> 02:42:25.168
IS THAT THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE

02:42:25.235 --> 02:42:27.537
TAKEN ON YOU KNOW THEIR WHERE

02:42:27.604 --> 02:42:28.905
THEY WANTED TO OR NOT ANOTHER

02:42:28.972 --> 02:42:30.440
ISSUE BUT I HAVE TAKEN ON A

02:42:30.507 --> 02:42:32.375
FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM --

02:42:32.442 --> 02:42:33.677
WITH THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONEY TO

02:42:33.743 --> 02:42:36.680
PROVIDE THAT ENTITLEMENT AND AND

02:42:36.746 --> 02:42:37.714
AND NOW THEIR BOARDS OF

02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:39.483
SUPERVISORS ARE ARE FACING A

02:42:39.549 --> 02:42:40.484
REALLY DIFFICULT TASK AND THAT

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:41.118
IS.

02:42:41.184 --> 02:42:42.652
THAT YOU KNOW YOU THE YOUNG

02:42:42.719 --> 02:42:44.454
PERSON WHO IS ENTITLED TO THE

02:42:44.521 --> 02:42:45.689
SERVICES IN TITLE THE SERVICES

02:42:45.755 --> 02:42:47.090
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THAT COUNTY

02:42:47.157 --> 02:42:48.391
CAN PAY FOR IT.

02:42:48.458 --> 02:42:49.059
AND THE COUNTIES OF TAKING ON

02:42:49.126 --> 02:42:50.527
THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PAYING

02:42:50.594 --> 02:42:51.862
FOR IT NOW THE QUESTION BECOMES

02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:53.430
ONE OF WELL HOW DO YOU DO THAT

02:42:53.497 --> 02:42:54.331
HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE.

02:42:54.397 --> 02:42:55.632
THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE GET

02:42:55.699 --> 02:42:56.900
THOSE SERVICES.

02:42:56.967 --> 02:43:00.370
SO I IT IT'S IT'S A COMPLICATED

02:43:00.437 --> 02:43:01.738
IT COMES.

02:43:01.805 --> 02:43:08.478

02:43:08.545 --> 02:43:09.946

AND THE YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY

02:44:20.283 --> 02:44:21.785
THINK --

02:44:21.851 --> 02:44:22.919
MORE BROADLY IN THE BILL OF THE

02:44:22.986 --> 02:44:24.120
TECH KIND OF BRAINSTORMING

02:44:24.187 --> 02:44:25.121
VISION -- A

02:44:25.188 --> 02:44:26.890
SYSTEM THAT WOULD SERVE THE

02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:28.892
UNIQUE NEEDS FOR OUR CHILDREN

02:44:28.959 --> 02:44:30.994
YOUTH IN CARE --

02:44:31.061 --> 02:44:32.996
THINKING OUT LOUD AND ON SOME OF

02:44:33.063 --> 02:44:35.298
THE THINGS THAT INTEGRATING SOME

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:35.932
OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD FROM MY

02:44:35.999 --> 02:44:37.734
MEMBERS --

02:44:37.801 --> 02:44:40.503
THERE'S SEVERAL IDEAS ARE START

02:44:40.570 --> 02:44:42.072
WITH I'M ONE OF THEM PROBABLY

02:44:42.138 --> 02:44:43.173
THE MOST PROCESS WOULD BE TO

02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:45.275
RADICALLY MOBILIZE RESOURCES FOR

02:44:45.342 --> 02:44:46.743
CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN CARE WE'VE

02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:48.278
TALKED ABOUT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN

02:44:48.345 --> 02:44:49.813
CONGREGATE CARE.

02:44:49.879 --> 02:44:53.550
AND AT THE IDEA ONE OF THE CORE --

02:44:53.617 --> 02:44:54.784
TENANTS OF C. C. R. WAS THAT A

02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.453
YOUNG PERSON WOULD GET SERVICES

02:44:56.519 --> 02:44:57.821
NO MATTER WHERE THEY WERE PLACE

02:44:57.887 --> 02:44:59.189
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO FILL UP

02:44:59.256 --> 02:45:00.624
TO A GROUP HOME OR CONGREGATE

02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:03.393
CARE SETTING. TO GET THE

02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.662
THERAPEUTIC HELP THAT THEY NEED --

02:45:05.729 --> 02:45:07.097
AND THE THE FOLKS ARE ON THE

02:45:07.163 --> 02:45:09.165
TABLE CAN CORRECT MY NUMBERS BUT

02:45:09.232 --> 02:45:10.834
THE AMOUNT OF THE MONEY THAT

02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:12.569
WE'RE SPENDING PER YOUTH PER

02:45:12.636 --> 02:45:14.104
MONTH IN GROUP HOMES.

02:45:14.170 --> 02:45:15.739
IS VERY VERY HIGH IF I HAD TO

02:45:15.805 --> 02:45:17.907
GUESS WOULD BE BETWEEN EIGHT TO

02:45:17.974 --> 02:45:18.475
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

02:45:18.541 --> 02:45:19.876
MONTH IF WE WERE TO USE THOSE

02:45:19.943 --> 02:45:21.711
RESOURCES TO REALLY SUPPORT THE

02:45:21.778 --> 02:45:25.181
FAMILY WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES.

02:45:25.248 --> 02:45:26.283
WITH THE SERVICES THAT MADE

02:45:26.349 --> 02:45:27.951
SENSE TO THEM AND REALLY

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:28.952
SUPPORTED THEM IN THEIR OWN

02:45:29.019 --> 02:45:32.422
COMMUNITIES I BET WE COULD GET A

02:45:32.489 --> 02:45:34.557
LOT OF THINGS DONE.

02:45:34.624 --> 02:45:36.693
I'M ANOTHER IDEA OR TO SUPPORT

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:39.029
THAT IDEA WOULD BE TO LOOK AT

02:45:39.095 --> 02:45:40.597
THE ESTHER TEEPEES BY DO HAVE ON

02:45:40.664 --> 02:45:42.799
SITE THERAPISTS AND CLINICIANS

02:45:42.866 --> 02:45:44.567
OR ARE CONTRACTED WITH THEM.

02:45:44.634 --> 02:45:45.969
INSTEAD OF HAVING AN ON SITE

02:45:46.036 --> 02:45:47.771
PERSON COULD WE MOBILIZE THAT

02:45:47.837 --> 02:45:49.673
PERSON TO GO VISIT THOSE TWELVE

02:45:49.739 --> 02:45:50.707
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR OWN

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:52.809
COMMUNITIES IS THAT A STRUCTURE

02:45:52.876 --> 02:45:56.079
THAT MAKES SENSE. FOR CALIFORNIA.

02:45:56.146 --> 02:45:57.314
ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO UPLIFT

02:45:57.380 --> 02:46:00.183
TODAY IS WRAPAROUND SERVICES A

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.518
LOT OF THE TRUMP FAMILY TEAM IN

02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:02.319
DIFFERENT --

02:46:02.385 --> 02:46:03.687
MODELS THAT WE HEAR ABOUT AND

02:46:03.753 --> 02:46:06.122
TALK ABOUT TODAY HAVE STAND OR

02:46:06.189 --> 02:46:08.692
HAVE ELEMENTS OF WRAP AROUND --

02:46:08.758 --> 02:46:10.527
AND THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT

02:46:10.593 --> 02:46:11.728
HAS HAD.

02:46:11.795 --> 02:46:13.563
A LOT OF THE EVIDENCE BASED OF

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:15.965
PRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES THAT WOULD

02:46:16.032 --> 02:46:17.500
BE WORTHWHILE TO RE LOOK AT

02:46:17.567 --> 02:46:20.837
ANOTHER IDEA ANOTHER SOLUTION.

02:46:20.904 --> 02:46:22.305
WOULD BE TO EXPAND THE NET OF

02:46:22.372 --> 02:46:25.275
WHAT ELIGIBLE SERVICES ARE SO WE

02:46:25.342 --> 02:46:26.776
WOULD WIDEN THE TYPES OF

02:46:26.843 --> 02:46:28.378
SERVICES THAT THE STATE OF

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:30.747
CALIFORNIA WOULD FIND. TO BE

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:32.749
MORE RELEVANT AND CONNECTED TO

02:46:32.816 --> 02:46:34.117
THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE

02:46:34.184 --> 02:46:35.552
SERVING --

02:46:35.618 --> 02:46:38.288
COULD INCLUDE NONTRADITIONAL OF

02:46:38.355 --> 02:46:40.056
SUPPORT AND HEALING THIS COULD

02:46:40.123 --> 02:46:41.624
BE COMMUNITY BASED OR CULTURALLY

02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:42.525
BASED.

02:46:42.592 --> 02:46:44.828
PROGRAMS AND SO THE IDEA WOULD

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:47.197
BE TO HAVE AN ARRAY OF SERVICES

02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:48.431
THAT REALLY MEET YOUNG PEOPLE

02:46:48.498 --> 02:46:49.666
WHERE THEY'RE AT IN THEIR OWN

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:50.934
COMMUNITIES.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:52.268
SPECIFICALLY I'D ALSO LIKE TO

02:46:52.335 --> 02:46:55.171
UPLIFT THE EXPANSION OF SERVICES

02:46:55.238 --> 02:46:56.773
FOR TAE YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:58.641
AS THEIR NET NAVIGATING

02:46:58.708 --> 02:46:59.709
ADULTHOOD.

02:46:59.776 --> 02:47:01.010
A LOT OF THEM HAVE COME TO A

02:47:01.077 --> 02:47:02.746
PLACE IN THEIR LIVES WHERE THERE

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:04.481
ONE TEEN RESOURCES THEY'RE

02:47:04.547 --> 02:47:06.149
WANTING TOOLS.

02:47:06.216 --> 02:47:07.784
AND AT THAT JUNCTURE IN TIME

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:09.386
THERE'S NOT A LOT TO OFFER AND

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:11.154
SO I'D LIKE TO SUPPORT AND

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:12.088
EXPAND --

02:47:12.155 --> 02:47:13.289

THE COROLLARY CHALLENGES --

FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS AT THE

THERE'S A LEARNING CURVE AND SO

02:48:12.615 --> 02:48:14.684
TO THAT END WE HAVE INVESTED

02:48:14.751 --> 02:48:16.085
VERY HEAVILY ON A?

ABOUT THE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS.

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:10.206
SOLUTION FOR IT FOR THE PURPOSE

02:49:10.273 --> 02:49:11.641
OF ADDRESSING THE LEARNING CURVE

IS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED

02:49:13.877 --> 02:49:15.378
THROUGH THIS LEARNING PROCESS.

02:49:15.445 --> 02:49:17.013
AID A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE KIND

02:49:17.080 --> 02:49:19.716
OF GUIDE THAT WE PLAN TO RELEASE

02:49:19.782 --> 02:49:21.150
AND MARCH THAT I THINK BRENDA

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:22.785
RELATES CAN ALSO SPEAK --

02:49:22.852 --> 02:49:24.687
TO WHERE WE ARE WE ARE

02:49:24.754 --> 02:49:26.789
IMPLEMENTING A VERY CAREFUL STEP

02:49:26.856 --> 02:49:29.025
BY STEP PROCESS THAT WILL

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:32.095
COMMUNICATE CLEARLY NOT ONLY HOW

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:34.030
AB WAIVER DECISION.

02:49:34.097 --> 02:49:35.932
SHOULD BE REACHED BUT ALSO ONCE

02:49:35.999 --> 02:49:38.868
IT IS REACHED EXACTLY WHAT NEEDS

02:49:38.935 --> 02:49:41.104
TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO AVOID --

02:49:41.170 --> 02:49:42.205
THE CONFUSION ESSENTIALLY OVER

02:49:42.272 --> 02:49:46.242
TIME CAN THING WE I DID ONE AND

02:49:46.309 --> 02:49:47.844
PUT INTO SIZE IS THAT.

02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:49.279
WE STILL FEEL THAT EACH CHILD

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:50.613
SPECIFIC DETERMINATION IS

02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:52.348
CRITICAL THAT JUMPING TO ANOTHER

02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:53.550
ONE SIZE FITS ALL IN THIS

02:49:53.616 --> 02:49:55.652
SITUATION IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT

02:49:55.718 --> 02:49:58.087
ANYONE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND --

02:49:58.154 --> 02:49:59.789
I'M ASSUMING THAT OTHERS MIGHT

02:49:59.856 --> 02:50:01.758
AGREE WITH ME ON THAT BUT THE

02:50:01.824 --> 02:50:05.328
CHILD AND FAMILY TEAM --

02:50:05.395 --> 02:50:07.263
MODEL THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED

02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:08.498
BOTH PRIOR TO SEE SEE OUR BUT

02:50:08.565 --> 02:50:10.600
THEN VERY MUCH EMPHASIZED IN CC

02:50:10.667 --> 02:50:11.301
ARE.

02:50:11.367 --> 02:50:12.702
WE THINK IS WHERE THE RUBBER

02:50:12.769 --> 02:50:15.204
MEETS THE ROAD IN NOT ONLY

02:50:15.271 --> 02:50:17.240
ANSWERING THIS QUESTION ABOUT

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.008
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER BUT ALSO

02:50:19.075 --> 02:50:20.910
ALL OF THE OTHER COMMENTS YOU

02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:22.345
MAY HAVE HEARD AROUND.

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:24.280
HOW WHAT IS IT THAT WOULD BEST

02:50:24.347 --> 02:50:25.615
MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CHILD

02:50:25.682 --> 02:50:27.216
WHAT OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES

02:50:27.283 --> 02:50:28.718
WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE? TO

02:50:28.785 --> 02:50:31.087
STABILIZE THE PLACEMENT TO PRINT

02:50:31.154 --> 02:50:32.121
TO TO HELP THE FAMILY REALLY

02:50:32.188 --> 02:50:34.490
CARE FOR THE CHILD BEFORE THEY

02:50:34.557 --> 02:50:36.292
EVEN GET TO AN S. T. R. T. P..

02:50:36.359 --> 02:50:37.427
AND THEN ONCE THEY'RE IN A NEST

02:50:37.493 --> 02:50:39.596
YEAR T. P. HOW DO WE CORRECTLY

02:50:39.662 --> 02:50:41.364
PLAN FOR AN IMPLEMENT THEIR

02:50:41.431 --> 02:50:42.899
THEIR TRANSITION TO A HOME

02:50:42.966 --> 02:50:44.267
SETTING --

02:50:44.334 --> 02:50:45.535
AND SO THAT CHILD SPECIFIC

02:50:45.602 --> 02:50:46.970
DETERMINATION I THINK IS REALLY

02:50:47.036 --> 02:50:49.639
CRITICAL AND SO RATHER THAN.

02:50:49.706 --> 02:50:50.306
AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN

02:50:50.373 --> 02:50:52.041
CONFUSION AROUND THE PRESUMPTIVE

02:50:52.108 --> 02:50:54.243
WORD PRESUMPTIVE --

02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:56.512
AND SO AS A RESULT FOR S. T. R.

02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:58.915
T. P. PLACEMENTS IN PARTICULAR

02:50:58.982 --> 02:51:00.383
WE REALLY NEED TO EMPHASIZE THAT

02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:02.151
FOR EVERY CHILD THERE HAS TO BE

02:51:02.218 --> 02:51:06.189
A VERY CAREFUL CONSIDERATION.

02:51:06.255 --> 02:51:06.723
AND THEN LASTLY WE WOULD

02:51:06.789 --> 02:51:07.657
EMPHASIZE THE PLANNING AND

02:51:07.724 --> 02:51:09.092
COLLABORATION AT THE SYSTEM

02:51:09.158 --> 02:51:12.462
LEVEL AND SO CCAR HAS REQUIRED

02:51:12.528 --> 02:51:15.131
PURSUANT TO AB.

02:51:15.198 --> 02:51:16.599
EIGHTEEN ELEVEN VERY RIGOROUS

02:51:16.666 --> 02:51:18.401
TRANSITION PLANS BOTH ACTUALLY

02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:19.969
AT THE TOP PACIFIC LEVEL BUT

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:21.304
MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THIS

02:51:21.371 --> 02:51:22.405
CONVERSATION.

02:51:22.472 --> 02:51:24.574
AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WHERE EVERY

02:51:24.641 --> 02:51:26.342

02:51:27.977 --> 02:51:31.848
IS REQUIRED TO YES CHARITY PIECE

02:51:31.914 --> 02:51:32.949
THEY PLAN TO PLACE AND

02:51:33.016 --> 02:51:34.484
REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTY THAT

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:36.786
THAT IT'S AND SO WE ARE NOW

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:38.321
REALLY PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH

02:51:38.388 --> 02:51:40.023
COUNTIES TO ASK WHO ARE THE

02:51:40.089 --> 02:51:42.225

RELATIONSHIPS ARE FINANCIAL --

02:51:49.265 --> 02:51:51.200
CONTRACTS WITH THOSE S. T. R. T.

02:51:51.267 --> 02:51:53.202
P. IS AND SO WE'RE REALLY TAKING

02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:55.471
A STEP BACK AND WORKING TO

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:58.408

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:05.995
HOME KATHY CENTER LÏNG.

02:55:06.062 --> 02:55:07.230
THANK MADAM CHAIR AND AS A

02:55:07.296 --> 02:55:08.130
MEMBER STONE --

02:55:08.197 --> 02:55:09.098
APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO

02:55:09.165 --> 02:55:09.966
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL

02:55:10.032 --> 02:55:11.534
SUGGESTIONS.

02:55:11.601 --> 02:55:13.703
I THINK ALL SORT OF GO ON THREE

02:55:13.769 --> 02:55:15.304
TRACKS SO THE FIRST IS RELATED

02:55:15.371 --> 02:55:16.939
TO THE PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER.

02:55:17.006 --> 02:55:18.341
I THINK WHAT WE'RE FINDING AND

02:55:18.407 --> 02:55:20.409
LOOKING AT THE DATA IS THAT IT'S

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.011
NOT LIKELY THAT THEY'LL BE A ONE

02:55:22.078 --> 02:55:23.679
SIZE FITS ALL SORT OF DO OR

02:55:23.746 --> 02:55:25.481
DON'T KIND OF ANSWER.

02:55:25.548 --> 02:55:28.417
THAT -- DATA --

02:55:28.484 --> 02:55:29.919
I THINK ONE OF MY PRIOR

02:55:29.986 --> 02:55:31.520
PANELISTS MENTIONED WAS THAT IT

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:33.856
SEEMS LIKE LARGER COUNTIES ARE

02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:36.058
MORE LIKELY TO WAIVE PRESUMPTIVE

02:55:36.125 --> 02:55:37.126
TRANSFER THAN SMALLER COUNTIES

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:38.527
AND A WORSE TO BE THAT THAT'S

02:55:38.594 --> 02:55:39.795
BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE A GREATER

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:41.130
CAPACITY TO PROVIDE.

02:55:41.197 --> 02:55:43.032
THOSE SERVICES IN THEIR COUNTY

02:55:43.099 --> 02:55:45.001
OR CARE COORDINATE VIA THEIR

02:55:45.067 --> 02:55:46.869
COUNTY JUST YOU KNOW LARGER

02:55:46.936 --> 02:55:48.104
COUNTY OFTEN EQUALS LARGER

02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:49.305
RESOURCES.

02:55:49.372 --> 02:55:51.140
AND SO SORT OF THAT AVAILABILITY

02:55:51.207 --> 02:55:53.209
OF SERVICES AND THINKING ABOUT

02:55:53.276 --> 02:55:55.745
THAT PERHAPS SOLUTIONS THERE AND

02:55:55.811 --> 02:55:57.947
THE KIND OF WORK BOOKER COOKBOOK

02:55:58.014 --> 02:55:59.615
THAT MS GRAY LEDGE IS TALKING

02:55:59.682 --> 02:56:00.049
ABOUT.

02:56:00.116 --> 02:56:01.851
CAN HELP THAT COUNTY THINK ABOUT

02:56:01.918 --> 02:56:05.021
WHAT VERSUS WHAT THAT HOST

02:56:05.087 --> 02:56:06.822
COUNTY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:08.224
AND THEN MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:09.625
TRULY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

02:56:09.692 --> 02:56:11.560
THE CHILD AND NOT JUST BASED ON

02:56:11.627 --> 02:56:13.095
KIND OF THE AVAILABILITY OF A

02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:14.230
PLACEMENT FOR EXAMPLE.

02:56:14.297 --> 02:56:15.564
RELATED TO THE PRESUMPTIVE

02:56:15.631 --> 02:56:17.300
TRANSFER WAVING IT OR NOT WAVING

02:56:17.366 --> 02:56:19.502
AT I THINK --

02:56:19.568 --> 02:56:21.103
WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:22.805
HOW TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY TO

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:24.340
SERVE OUR YOUTH IN OUR

02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:27.677
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE EPS C. T.

02:56:27.743 --> 02:56:29.445
ENTITLEMENT IS THAT YOU HEARD

02:56:29.512 --> 02:56:30.513
ABOUT AS WELL AND THAT.

02:56:30.579 --> 02:56:32.048
FALL HEARING RELATED TO MENTAL

02:56:32.114 --> 02:56:33.549
HEALTH --

02:56:33.616 --> 02:56:35.584
IT'S IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT IF

02:56:35.651 --> 02:56:37.253
THE YOUTH HAS THAT NEED THAT

02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:37.820
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THAT

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:38.754
FILLED.

02:56:38.821 --> 02:56:40.890
AND SO I THINK CONTINUING THE

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:42.558
DISCUSSIONS THAT ALREADY EXIST

02:56:42.625 --> 02:56:44.827
RELATED TO IS THE PROBLEM THAT

02:56:44.894 --> 02:56:46.729
MORE MONEY IS NEEDED --

02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:47.997
IS THERE A PROBLEM THAT THE

02:56:48.064 --> 02:56:49.498
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND

02:56:49.565 --> 02:56:51.334
PROVIDERS ARE THERE IS A PROBLEM

02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:52.368
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:56:52.435 --> 02:56:54.170
AUTHORIZE ADDITIONAL TYPES OF

02:56:54.236 --> 02:56:55.538
SERVICES --

02:56:55.604 --> 02:56:57.573
DO WE NEED TO A GREATER CAPACITY

02:56:57.640 --> 02:56:59.408
TO DO KIND OF ONE OFF CONTRACTS

02:56:59.475 --> 02:57:00.876
WITH THE PARTICULAR PROVIDER.

02:57:00.943 --> 02:57:02.511
I FEEL LIKE ALL OF THOSE ARE

02:57:02.578 --> 02:57:04.347
LIKELY PART OF THE SOLUTION AND

02:57:04.413 --> 02:57:05.414
WERE THERE WERE THERE FOR EVERY

02:57:05.481 --> 02:57:06.882
CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO

HAPPEN BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE

02:57:07.917 --> 02:57:08.851
THINGS.

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:10.519
I THINK NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AND

02:57:10.586 --> 02:57:12.922
THEN FINALLY I THINK THESE ARE

02:57:12.989 --> 02:57:14.957

DO TO MAKE IT BETTER.

02:57:18.794 --> 02:57:20.863
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE'S

02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:24.033
SORT OF ONE MAGIC WAND THE OF

02:57:24.100 --> 02:57:25.401

02:57:33.409 --> 02:57:34.710
CRITICAL THING AND YOU'VE HEARD

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:36.545

TO THE YOUTH WHERE THEY ARE

02:57:45.554 --> 02:57:46.022
WRAPPING THEM AROUND THE

SERVICES AND REALLY FIGURING OUT

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:49.158

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:52.828

HIGHER NEEDS WE'D EXPECTED AND

02:57:56.365 --> 02:57:57.600
HOPED THAT THERE WOULD BE A A

02:57:57.666 --> 02:58:00.469
CADRE OF FAMILIES WHO WOULD BE

02:58:00.536 --> 02:58:02.438
WILLING AND ABLE. TO SUPPORT

02:58:02.505 --> 02:58:04.006
THOSE YOUTH OUTSIDE OF A GROUP

02:58:04.073 --> 02:58:05.041
HOME --

02:58:05.107 --> 02:58:06.809

REALLY MATERIALIZE SORT OF

02:58:12.214 --> 02:58:14.050
THERAPEUTIC FOSTER CARE IS ONE

02:58:14.116 --> 02:58:15.918
WAY OF REFERRING TO THEM WHETHER

MAYBE THAT SAID --

02:58:30.299 --> 02:58:31.901
SUPPORTING THEM IN THE MOMENT --

02:58:31.967 --> 02:58:33.436
WE'VE GOT THAT SORT OF URGENT

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:36.338

02:58:45.648 --> 02:58:47.216
WE CAN DO --

02:58:47.283 --> 02:58:48.851
TO BRING TO BEAR IT'S JUST A

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:50.686
MATTER OF OF GETTING THOSE ALL

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:53.122
IN PLACE AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET

02:58:53.189 --> 02:58:53.923
SO.

02:58:53.989 --> 02:58:54.924
MY THOUGHTS.

02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:56.892
TICKET GOES BACK TO THE AMOUNT

02:58:56.959 --> 02:58:58.661
OF MONEY THAT IS SPENT --

02:58:58.727 --> 02:58:59.995
AND HOMES AND IF WE CAN USE THAT

02:59:00.062 --> 02:59:03.332
FOR THE FAMILIES TO SUPPORT THEM

02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:03.632
[inaudible]

02:59:03.699 --> 02:59:05.768
MISTER SCHROEDER.

02:59:05.835 --> 02:59:08.104
THAT SORT OF I THINK YOU'VE JUST

02:59:08.170 --> 02:59:09.271
BEEN CAPS ELATED SIR WHAT'S THE

02:59:09.338 --> 02:59:10.239
C. R. HAS BEEN ABOUT WHICH IS

02:59:10.306 --> 02:59:11.240
HOW DO WE TAKE.

02:59:11.307 --> 02:59:12.808
MONEY THAT WE WERE PREVIOUSLY

02:59:12.875 --> 02:59:14.143
SPENDING FOR FOR PRETTY

02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:15.678
EXPENSIVE RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:17.880
IN THE THAT MONEY --

02:59:17.947 --> 02:59:19.348
INTO --

02:59:19.415 --> 02:59:20.716
FAMILY BASED --

02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:22.618
SETTINGS FOR FOR YOUTH AND THEN

02:59:22.685 --> 02:59:24.487
WRAP SERVICES SUPPORT AROUND

02:59:24.553 --> 02:59:25.955
THAT FAMILY THAT YOUNG PERSON SO

02:59:26.021 --> 02:59:27.389
THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED.

02:59:27.456 --> 02:59:28.691
SO I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE HIT THE

02:59:28.757 --> 02:59:30.259
NAIL ON THE HEAD SO I THINK

02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:31.760
WE'VE GOT THE MECHANISMS IN

02:59:31.827 --> 02:59:33.829
PLACE THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE

02:59:33.896 --> 02:59:37.333
MAKE THIS MECHANISMS WORK --

02:59:37.399 --> 02:59:38.601
I I EITHER THERE A COUPLE THINGS

02:59:38.667 --> 02:59:40.469
THAT THAT COME TO MIND AS IT IS

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:41.704
I THINK ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF

02:59:41.770 --> 02:59:43.105
PRESUMPTIVE TRANSFER.

02:59:43.172 --> 02:59:45.274
AND ONE IS THAT THAT CONTINUES

02:59:45.341 --> 02:59:46.442
CARRY FORM.

02:59:46.509 --> 02:59:48.177
SORTOF PRESUMED AND THEN MADE

02:59:48.244 --> 02:59:50.179
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS ABOUT --

02:59:50.246 --> 02:59:52.114
INTEGRATION OF EFFORTS BETWEEN --

02:59:52.181 --> 02:59:53.782
COUNTY MIDDLE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS

02:59:53.849 --> 02:59:54.950
AND AND CHILD WELFARE

02:59:55.017 --> 02:59:55.885
DEPARTMENTS IN JUVENILE

02:59:55.951 --> 02:59:57.453
PROBATION DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS

02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:59.188
OF THOSE YOUTH WHO NEED --

02:59:59.255 --> 03:00:00.489
AND SOME TYPE OF OUT OF HOME

03:00:00.556 --> 03:00:03.792
CARE IT'S STILL --

03:00:03.859 --> 03:00:06.028
IS SOMETHING IT'S IN PROCESS --

03:00:06.095 --> 03:00:08.631
THE A I THINK THAT --

03:00:08.697 --> 03:00:10.733
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS I I CAN'T

03:00:10.799 --> 03:00:11.333
REMEMBER DIANA POINTED OUT OR

03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:13.202
NOT -- BUT

03:00:13.269 --> 03:00:16.906
IF YOU HAVE A A PARTICULAR --

03:00:16.972 --> 03:00:18.440
CHILD WELFARE AB DEPARTMENT IS

03:00:18.507 --> 03:00:20.442
PREPARED TO PLACE A CHILD WITH A

03:00:20.509 --> 03:00:22.011
PARTICULAR STR TP.

03:00:22.077 --> 03:00:23.012
BUT THE MENTAL HEALTH --

03:00:23.078 --> 03:00:24.380
PLAN IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY

03:00:24.446 --> 03:00:25.881
DOESN'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

03:00:25.948 --> 03:00:26.615
THEM.

03:00:26.682 --> 03:00:28.484
THEN ONE OF THINGS YOU CAN DO IS

03:00:28.551 --> 03:00:32.388
JUST AND AND THEN IT BECOMES THE

03:00:32.454 --> 03:00:33.923
RESPONSIBILITY THE RECEIVING

03:00:33.989 --> 03:00:34.790
COUNTY.

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:37.226
AND I AND I I I THINK THAT --

03:00:37.293 --> 03:00:38.627
THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT

03:00:38.694 --> 03:00:39.795
AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A LOOK

03:00:39.862 --> 03:00:42.231
AT AT WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF

03:00:42.298 --> 03:00:43.766
THAT KIND OF CARE FOR KIDS AND

03:00:43.832 --> 03:00:45.734
AND ENSURING THAT THAT THAT DOES

03:00:45.801 --> 03:00:46.769
OCCUR.

03:00:46.835 --> 03:00:48.070
AND THAT THOSE EFFORTS ARE

03:00:48.137 --> 03:00:49.271
COORDINATED.

03:00:49.338 --> 03:00:51.240
I THINK THE THE BOTTOM LINE IS

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:52.074
IN THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL

03:00:52.141 --> 03:00:54.376
ABOUT FROM DAY ONE IS TO ENSURE.

03:00:54.443 --> 03:00:56.512
THAT YOU GET THE SERVICES THEY

03:00:56.579 --> 03:00:57.313
NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT NAY

03:00:57.379 --> 03:00:58.247
NOTHING NEEDED FOR AS LONG AS

03:00:58.314 --> 03:01:00.049
THEY NEED IT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

03:01:00.115 --> 03:01:01.383
THIS IS ALL ABOUT --

03:01:01.450 --> 03:01:03.085
AND THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY

03:01:03.152 --> 03:01:04.386
THERE'S A POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR

03:01:04.453 --> 03:01:06.121
THAT -- FOR

03:01:06.188 --> 03:01:07.756
THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MEMBER

03:01:07.823 --> 03:01:10.092
AGENCIES A PIECE OF THAT IS THAT

03:01:10.159 --> 03:01:12.328
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PART OF THAT

03:01:12.394 --> 03:01:14.563
CAN'T BE SO ONEROUS THAT THEY

03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:16.298

IN NOT TOO SMALL IS THIS THAT

03:01:24.573 --> 03:01:26.242

03:01:26.308 --> 03:01:26.809
PROVIDERS HAVE EVER SIMILAR

03:01:26.875 --> 03:01:28.310
ISSUE -- AND

03:01:28.377 --> 03:01:29.712
SO I I I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK

03:01:29.778 --> 03:01:30.980
AT THAT PIECE AS WELL SO THAT

03:01:31.046 --> 03:01:32.982
ANY FIX THAT WE COME UP FOR THIS

03:01:33.048 --> 03:01:34.650

03:01:34.717 --> 03:01:35.584
A NEED.

03:01:35.651 --> 03:01:36.752

03:02:09.151 --> 03:02:12.588
EXPERIENCING ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF

03:02:12.655 --> 03:02:14.056
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH

03:02:14.123 --> 03:02:16.525
PER CHILD PLACED IN RESIDENTIAL

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:17.126

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

03:02:21.297 --> 03:02:26.268
AND TO THAT END AGAIN THE WHOLE --

03:02:26.335 --> 03:02:28.570
QUESTION OF WAIVER OR NOT THERE

03:02:28.637 --> 03:02:31.006
IS THE THE ASSOCIATION FORMALLY

03:02:31.073 --> 03:02:34.910

RESPONSIBILITY RICH BECAUSE IT'S

03:02:44.153 --> 03:02:46.355
THE FIRST TWO LETTERS ARE SHORT

03:02:46.422 --> 03:02:47.389
TERM.

03:02:47.456 --> 03:02:51.060
ALONG WITH THE PLACING COUNTY

03:02:51.126 --> 03:02:52.628
FOR THAT MENTAL HEALTH PLAN TO

03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:54.797
CONTINUE A CONTINUITY OF CARE

03:02:54.863 --> 03:02:57.433
BECAUSE THAT WE WANT THOSE

03:02:57.499 --> 03:02:58.200
CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO COME BACK

03:02:58.267 --> 03:02:59.001
HOME.

03:02:59.068 --> 03:03:01.236
SO THAT IS VERY MUCH IF YOU TAKE

03:03:01.303 --> 03:03:02.538
THE DAHLE MENTAL HEALTH DOLLAR

03:03:02.604 --> 03:03:04.239
AMOUNT AND THE PLACE AND THE

03:03:04.306 --> 03:03:06.442
RESIDENTIAL RATE AMOUNT TOGETHER

03:03:06.508 --> 03:03:08.377
YOUR YOUR YOUR SPOT ON AND SO I

03:03:08.444 --> 03:03:09.712
WANTED TO SAY THAT.

03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:12.815
THE OTHER THING WELL TO NOT TALK

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:14.249
ABOUT FINANCE FOR A MINUTE.

03:03:14.316 --> 03:03:17.252
IS THAT JUST AS ACTUALLY AS AN

03:03:17.319 --> 03:03:18.387
ADOPTEE.

03:03:18.454 --> 03:03:22.658
AND SO SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT --

03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:25.227
SIXTY YEARS AGO --

03:03:25.294 --> 03:03:26.729
OR MORE --

03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:29.665
ADOPTED IN BEING ADOPTED IN A

03:03:29.732 --> 03:03:31.433
DAY AND AGE THAT THAT WAS NOT

03:03:31.500 --> 03:03:33.602
THE NORM THAT WAS NOT COMMON.

03:03:33.669 --> 03:03:36.972
AND AND BI RACIAL ADOPTIONS WAS

03:03:37.039 --> 03:03:38.674
DEFINITELY NOT COMMENT MY MAIDEN

03:03:38.741 --> 03:03:41.243
NAME IS HE WORKED.

03:03:41.310 --> 03:03:43.312
WHICH IS A VERY GERMAN NAME --

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:44.847
SO -- YOU

03:03:44.913 --> 03:03:46.582
KNOW MY SISTER AND I WERE TO OF

03:03:46.648 --> 03:03:48.417
FOR NON WHITES IN THE TOWN WE

03:03:48.484 --> 03:03:49.451
GREW UP IN.

03:03:49.518 --> 03:03:53.355
SO WE WE WHAT I KNOW IS THAT

03:03:53.422 --> 03:03:56.058
TRAUMA INFORMED CARE.

03:03:56.125 --> 03:03:57.760
TRAINING IS GOING TO MAKE A

03:03:57.826 --> 03:04:00.729
DIFFERENCE BOTH --

03:04:00.796 --> 03:04:02.331
FOR THE PLACING AGENCIES FOR THE

03:04:02.398 --> 03:04:04.800
MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS FOR THE

03:04:04.867 --> 03:04:06.735
FOR THE FAMILIES THE PARENTS AND

03:04:06.802 --> 03:04:08.637
FAMILIES WHO WORK SERVING THE

03:04:08.704 --> 03:04:10.572
CHILDREN BUT WHO ARE ALSO THE

03:04:10.639 --> 03:04:12.241
HOPEFULLY.

03:04:12.307 --> 03:04:14.610
THE THE KICK THE PARENTS WERE

03:04:14.676 --> 03:04:15.811
GETTING THEIR CHILDREN BACK ARE

03:04:15.878 --> 03:04:17.346
LEARNING AND UNDERSTANDING SOME

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:19.448
OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO I THINK

03:04:19.515 --> 03:04:20.349
THAT.

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:21.817
TRADE IS REALLY CRITICAL AND SO

03:04:21.884 --> 03:04:26.388
WE MORE MORE MORE ACROSS THE

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:28.624
BOARD WITH YOUR PROVIDER OR A

03:04:28.690 --> 03:04:29.491
KIT -- CARE

03:04:29.558 --> 03:04:31.527
GIVER OF ANY KIND SO I THINK

03:04:31.593 --> 03:04:33.162
THAT'S CRITICAL AND THEN

03:04:33.228 --> 03:04:35.597
DEFINITELY --

03:04:35.664 --> 03:04:37.766
AS WE LOOK AT JUST THE

03:04:37.833 --> 03:04:39.401
UNFORTUNATELY JUST STICKS OF

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:41.870
SERVICE THERE ARE DOCUMENTS AND

03:04:41.937 --> 03:04:43.572
THE SOONER THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE

03:04:43.639 --> 03:04:45.774
LINED UP AS A DETERMINATION IS

03:04:45.841 --> 03:04:48.243
MADE ON WHERE THE CHILD IN YOU

03:04:48.310 --> 03:04:48.911
THIS CHILD OR YOUTH IS GOING TO

03:04:48.977 --> 03:04:49.478
GO.

03:04:49.545 --> 03:04:50.813
THE SOONER THOSE THINGS ARE

03:04:50.879 --> 03:04:52.781
LINED UP SO WHEN THAT CHILD GOES

03:04:52.848 --> 03:04:54.283
WERE EVER THEY'RE GOING WHETHER

03:04:54.349 --> 03:04:57.586
LOCALLY OR OUT OF COUNTY.

03:04:57.653 --> 03:04:59.321
EVERYTHING IS GOOD TO GO SO THAT

03:04:59.388 --> 03:05:00.956
IMMEDIATELY JUST AS WE SAID THE

03:05:01.023 --> 03:05:02.391
MINUTE THAT CHILD.

03:05:02.458 --> 03:05:06.094
GOES SOMEWHERE SERVICES FOLLOW

03:05:06.161 --> 03:05:07.763
FOR CAN START AND I JUST THINK

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:09.031
THAT'S CRITICAL BECAUSE WE

03:05:09.097 --> 03:05:11.600
ALREADY KNOW THE MORE SUPPORT WE

03:05:11.667 --> 03:05:13.435
CAN PROVIDE THOSE CHILDREN WITH

03:05:13.502 --> 03:05:18.540
CONTINUITY OF CARE THE BETTER.

03:05:18.607 --> 03:05:19.875
THANK YOU SO MUCH IT JUST AND

03:05:19.942 --> 03:05:21.376
