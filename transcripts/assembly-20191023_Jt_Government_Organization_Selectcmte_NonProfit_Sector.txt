AS THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE NONPROFIT SECTOR I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NON PROFITS- AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT WE ALSO DISCUSSED SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. THAT COME TO NONPROFIT PARTICULARLY AROUND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IN CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT ARE THE FOURTH LARGEST INDUSTRY BY EMPLOYMENT PRODUCE IN ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR. TEAM CALIFORNIA JOBS. EVERY YEAR CALIFORNIA NONPROFITS GENERATE TWO HUNDRED EIGHT BILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE IMMOBILIZE THE EQUIVALENT OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE. THOUSAND AND A FULL TIME JOB DONE BY VOLUNTEERS. THE FEEDER CHILDREN SHELTER HOMELESS AND VIRTUALLY EVERY CRITICAL CHALLENGE FACING US TODAY DURING THE THOMAS FIRE AND THE MONICA DEBRIS FLOW NONPROFIT. ARE THE AUGMENT THE WIDE RANGE OF COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES UTILIZING UNIQUE SKILL SET AND THE TALENTS OF MANY COMMITTED INDIVIDUALS THERE ARE MANY NONPROFITS NOT ONLY ON THE PANEL TODAY THAT PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. THAT IS WHY IN THIS HEARING IS SO IMPORTANT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I CHAIRMAN A GRADE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

THE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NONPROFIT SECTOR. TODAY AS THE ROLE OF NONPROFITS EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE SANTA BARBARA COUNTY LIKE MOST CALIFORNIANS OF RECENT ARE NO STRANGER TO ESTHER'S AND OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH ALL OF YOU DURING THE UNRELENTING THOMAS FIRE IN THE TRAGEDY OF THE MONTH TO CEDAR MUD SLIDES WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES OF THAT DISASTERS NO CITY OR COUNTY- IS AN ISLAND THESE LARGE SCALE DISASTERS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION- OF WORKING TOGETHER THE STATE'S MUTUAL SYSTEM IN THE IDEAS. OF NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS TODAY. DISASTROUS CAN CERTAINLY BRING OUT THE BEST IN PEOPLE IS WERE CUT CUSTOM HEARING STORIES OF HEROES AND I MISS THE CHAOS OF WILD FIRES AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS. FAR TOO OFTEN THE PEOPLE COMMUNITIES HIT HARDEST BY DISASTERS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE. WE KNOW NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS CAN AND WILL IT DO FILL CRITICAL UNMET NEEDS DURING THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE. ASTERS THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY INVESTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE URGENCY LEGISLATION AB SEVENTY TWO. TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN AS A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO ENHANCE DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. I AM PLEASE WE HAVE BAKER CALIFORNIA'S.

AND WE WILL DO TWO PANELS- IN AFTER THE PANEL WE WILL ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND ONE MINUTE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO PUBLIC COMMENT AHEAD AND HAVE YOU WILL BEGIN WHO NEVER LIKE TO. THERE WE ARE THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AS BEAUTIFUL DRIVE UP HERE TO VISIT SANTA BARBARA CA TAT MY NAME IS ABBY AND I AM THE CHIEF OF THE OFFICE OF PRIVATE SECTOR. NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COORDINATION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TAKE A COUPLE BREATHS WHENEVER I SAY THAT TITLE- BECAUSE IT IS A VERY LONG TITLE BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY AIMED ENCOMPASSES THE THING THAT I DO I ALSO COORDINATE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES. WITH THE PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION WITH THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS OF VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND- FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. I AM NOT EXTERNAL AFFAIRS BUT WHAT I DO IS I MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND I A I LIKE TO CONSIDER MYSELF THE CALLAWAY YES MATCH MAKER. SO WHENEVER A NON PROFIT COMES TO CALLOW YES AND WORKS WITH US I MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED WITH THE EXPERTS THAT DO WHAT THEY DO SO IT IS. A SAY SHELTERING MASCARA SHELTERING THEN THE RED CROSS. I KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT DENISE AND HER COLLEAGUES ARE CONNECTED TO THE STATE OFFICIALS THAT THAT WORK ON THAT SUBJECT AS WELL AND- MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S PLAY. NICE IN THE SANDBOX TOGETHER IT GETS. KIND OF STRESSFUL DURING DISASTERS AS YOU WOULD ALL IMAGINE AND SO I I'D MEDIATE AND I MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED. IN ORDER TO SERVE THE CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THE DISASTER. SO THAT'S THAT'S MY ROLE IN A VERY SMALL NOT SHOW. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF HOW I HAVE- WORKED ON SOME OF THE DISASTERS THAT WE'VE HAD IN HOW THAT COORDINATION ROLE HAPPENS AND THE VALUE OF IT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD THE- LARGE NORTH BAY FIRES UP IN CINEMA COUNTY. AND AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE HAD- THE FIRED THE THOMAS FIRE DOWN HERE. AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER FIRES AND- I BELIEVE IS ORANGE COUNTY. A IT WAS A MASSIVE EFFORT AND IT WAS REALLY TAXING ON ALL OF OUR NON PROFITS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD AND SOME OF THESE NONPROFITS ARE- MASTERS AT THEIR CRAFT. WHEN IT COMES TO SHELTERING YOU GET OUT OF THE WAY WHEN A FOR THE RED CROSS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY- HAVE WHAT THEY DO BUT YOU JUST GET OUT OF THEIR WAY AND LET THEM DO THEIR JOB. SAME COMES FOR FEEDING YOU KNOW WE HAVE. A WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN WE HAVE THE- ADVENTIST WE HAVE A SOUTHERN BAPTIST. ALL THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY ARE EXPERTS AT MASS FEEDING. AND SO WE GET OUT OF THE WAY NOW AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. DURING A DISASTER. EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS TO HELP AND SO THEY COME TO US AND THINK HOW DO WE HELP HOW DO WE HELP. ONE OF THE BIG ONES THAT WE HAD THAT CAME TO US GOOGLE. AND WAS A. A GRAND ME FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT. A MONETARY DONATION THAT'S ALWAYS FAST AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SEND THEM TO WHERE THEY NEEDED TO GO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WENT TO THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY FOUNDATIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BEING AFFECTED. NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN- WITHIN THEIR LIKE WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING WANT TO DO SOMETHING. THEY HAVE A FLEET OF FOOD TRUCKS FANCY FOOD TRUCKS BECAUSE THEY FEED ALL THEIR GOOGLE LORS EVERY DAY. AND THEY WANTED TO GIVE THEM AND SEND THEM TO THE SHELTERS. THAT'S A BIG NO NO. I'M LOOKING AT IT GOING. I WOULD BE GREAT I THINK THE SURVIVORS WOULD LOVE IT BECAUSE THAT'S COOL RIGHT YOU KNOW OKAY I HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING AT LEAST I. HAVE A COOL MEAL FROM A GOOGLE FOOD TRUCK. BUT IT'S- ALL OF OUR NON PROFITS ARE ALREADY THERE PLANNING THIS ALL OUT. FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO THE MEALS HOW DO FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HOW TO DO THIS HAVE TO DO THAT THEY'VE GOT THE SUPPLIES. AND IF WE BROUGHT IN A BUNCH OF FOOD TRUCKS ALL THAT WOULD DO IS MESS THEM UP THE LAST THING WE WANTED TO DO. AND SO WHAT MARK MY STAFF AND I WE HAD TO GET CREATIVE AND THINK WELL HOW DO WE DO THIS WHAT WE DO. SO WHAT WE ENDED UP DOING WAS SENDING THE FOOD TRUCKS TO THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS. WHEN PEOPLE WERE STANDING IN LINE TO GET THEIR SERVICES AND TO TALK TO THEIR INSURANCE PEOPLE INTO THE COUNTY FOLKS. THEY COULD HAVE A FREE MEAL IF THEY WANTED TO FROM THE GOODWILL TRUCKS AND SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A WIN WIN. BUT THAT'S WHY THE IMPORTANCE OF MY OFFICE IS TO STOP THAT KIND OF A MESS BECAUSE ALL THAT WOULD HAVE DONE IS MAKE A HEARTACHE FOR THE NON PROFITS THAT WORK SO TIRELESSLY. TO DO WHAT THEY'RE DOING SO THAT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE'RE ABLE TO. COORDINATE THAT EFFORT BECAUSE AT THE STATE LEVEL WE WHERE WE CAN SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND MAKE SURE THAT THE BEST IS THERE. SO ONE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION ABOUT CALLOW YES THAT'S BEYOND ME. IS WE HAVE AN AMAZING TEAM THAT'S GRANTS MANAGEMENT. AND WE HANDLE THE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT GRANTS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN WE TURN AROUND. AND HAND THOSE OUT. BASED TO THE LEVEL OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WE SO THEY CAN BY FIRE TRUCKS THEY CAN BY POLICE CARS THEY CAN DO ALL THAT KIND OF- PUBLIC SAFETY THINGS. BUT ALSO PART OF THAT IS WE HAVE THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION. AND THE- VICTIM SERVICES. GRANTS AND WE SUPPORT OUR NON PROFITS FOR THAT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO- BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN AND YOU ALL KNOW FIRST HAND. ARE DISASTERS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE VIOLENCE. THERE ARE MORE MENTALLY TAXING AND DRAINING. AND SO WE NEED- OF MORE COUNSELORS AND MORE CRISIS COUNSELORS. AND THAT'S THE NON PROFITS THAT STEP UP INTO THAT ROLE. AS A WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PREPARE THEM FOR THE DISASTERS. BY FUNNELING MONEY. INTO THOSE NONPROFITS TO BRING THAT INFORMATION UP SO THAT'S A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. AS WELL TO ASSIST THE NONPROFITS SO. THAT'S MARI SEVEN MINUTES AND I WILL BE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND I'M ALWAYS HERE. SO IF YOU SEE ME AND YOU HAVEN'T QUESTION BY ALL MEANS FIND BE AFTERWARDS THAT I CAN ANSWER THEM. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. AT THIS TIME WE'LL HEAR FROM ABIGAIL BROWN. ACTUALLY NO EXCUSE ME I SKIPPED OVER CARE BAKER. WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I CAN'T APPLY DO ENOUGH FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS HEARING I THINK IS THIS FULL ROOM REALLY SHOWS THERE ARE MORE PASSIONATE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT CARE ABOUT- VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES UP AND I JUST WANNA I KNOW ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE HERE JUST THANK. EVERYONE FOR THEIR EFFORTS AND THEIR PASSION AND THEIR CARE- IT MATTERS AND I'M JUST SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS HEARING HI TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS MAKING IN THIS SPACE- I AM OF A SENIOR ADVISER HELLO YES NEWLY APPOINTED TO CO CHAIR OF THE LEASE DOES CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN. WHICH IS THE EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY SPOKE OUT- AND IS THE ARCHITECT OF THAT CAMPAIGN I JUST THOUGHT I'D TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO EXPLAIN THE COMPONENTS OF THE CAMPAIGN- AND THEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE- THIS WAS ANNOUNCED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOME I THINK. PROBABLY THE DAY AFTER HE WAS SWORN IN AND BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY TO BOTH HE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY ENSURE THAT ARE MORE MOST DIVERSE AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS REALLY ARE READY FOR WILD FIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS. AND SO A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WAS SET ASIDE IN THIS TRAILER BILL AND- I WORKED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM AND LEGISLATURE TO REALLY SORT OUT WHAT ARE THE STRATEGIES FOR PUTTING OUT MONEY TO WORK SO I WANTED TO KIND OF EXPLAIN OUT WHERE THAT MONEY IS AT WORK- FIRST OF ALL WE DECIDED TO TARGET SIX COUNTIES. TO IN THE NORTH TO CENTRAL AND TWO IN THE SOUTH THAT WE KNEW WE NEEDED IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IT INCLUDED SHASTA LAKE FRESNO TULARE. SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES. AND THEN WHAT WE SAID ALL OTHER COUNTIES THAT YOU MAY APPLY. FOR THE REMAINING DOLLARS AND WE WERE ABLE TO FIND EIGHTEEN ADDITIONAL COUNTIES SO WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES. THAT ARE AT THE CENTER OF THIS INITIATIVE RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE OTHER INVESTMENTS OUT OF THE FIFTY MILLION THAT BENEFIT THE WHOLE STATE AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CLARIFY THAT IN A SECOND- THE THING IS I THINK REALLY EXCITING ABOUT IT IS THE ENTIRE FIFTY MILLION. WENT OUT TO NON PROFITS THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY- LANDED SO- WHETHER IN SAN BERNADINO AND YOU'RE THE ORGANIZATION AL SOUL. WHO WORKS PRIMARILY WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY YOU WERE THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT RECEIVED THESE DOLLARS AND THEN YOU ARE IN A POSITION WHERE YOU SUB GRANTS. TO OTHER NON PROFITS THAT WORK WITH OTHER PRIORITY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SO WHAT ARE THOSE POPULATIONS THOSE ARE SENIORS. AS A PEOPLE DISABILITIES NON ENGLISH SPEAKERS MIGRANT UNDOCUMENTED- MEMBERS OF TRIBES- ALL POP PEOPLE IN POVERTY. THE REST SOCIALLY ISOLATED THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT OFTEN GET CAUGHT AND CAN'T GET OUT. SO THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE IS TO REALLY BE SURE THAT WE CAN EDUCATE THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH THE DOLLARS THAT ARE SPENT ON A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN. SO SOME OF THE DOLLARS ARE SET ASIDE FOR COMMUNICATION- INVESTMENT SO CURRICULUM- AND IT'S GIVEN IN SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ENGLISH SPANISH VIETNAMESE KOREAN AND TAGALOG. ARMENIAN CHINESE THESE ARE THE SIX MOST FREQUENTLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES IF YOU DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH HERE IN IN CALIFORNIA ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENT WENT TO BUILDING OUT OUR VOLUNTEER AND SERVICE TEAM ASSETS IN OUR STATE YOU KNOW SANTA BARBARA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING PROGRAMS THESE DOES CALIFORNIA LILIANA IN THE HOUSE. AND JUST WANNA AND CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOUR INNOVATION THIS IS A PHENOMENAL EIGHT OUR FAMILY PREPAREDNESS- A TRAINING THAT IS OFFERED IN SPANISH- THE WILL TRANSLATED IN OTHER LANGUAGES SO- WHAT WE DID DO IS ALSO DEDICATE SOME OF THE FUNDS TO GROW THE LEASE DOES PROGRAM MODEL IN. UP TO SIXTY DIFFERENT MARKETS WERE AND THAT'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AND ALSO GROW SEARCH COMMUNITY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS DOWN OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCILS WILL BE PUT TO WORK. WITH EDUCATING- OFFERING THEIR CURRICULUM AND- COUNTY SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT INVESTMENT. FINALLY I THINK THE THING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN IS A PEOPLE CENTERED CAMPAIGN BUT IT'S INFORMED BY DATA. UP FOR THE FIRST TIME WHAT WE'VE DONE IS OVERLAPPED- HAZARD DATA AND CREATED HEAT MAPS WITH DIFFERENT SOCIAL VULNERABILITY POPULATIONS SO THAT YOU CAN LOOK OUT OF ANY GIVEN COUNTY AND THIS IS BEEN DONE FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. SO YOU CAN LOOK HERE IN SANTA BARBARA AND LOOK AT WHAT NICHE OF SANTA BARBARA IS AT RISK FOR EARTHQUAKE. WHAT IS AT RISK FOR FLOODING IF THAT WERE AN ISSUE FOR- WILD FIRES AND THEN BE ABLE TO LOOK AT WELL WE'RE TO OUR SENIORS LIVE AND WHERE TO OUR- MIGRANT COMMUNITY LIVE. AND BE ABLE TO THEN DO A VERY TARGETED CAMPAIGN RIGHT IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY. SO BY HAVING KIND OF THIS DATA SCIENCE REALLY LEADING AND ARE DESIGNED- ALONG WITH THE STRENGTH OF TRUSTED BROKERS THAT ARE IN THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY FAITH BASED AS WELL AS OTHER NON PROFITS I THINK WERE ABLE TO LIKE CAPITALIZE. ON THOSE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THEIR BABIES AND REALLY MAKE SURE WE GET ARE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES REALLY EDUCATED. AND PREPARE. AND WITHOUT A JUST BUT YOU ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANKS I THINK WE'LL GET THROUGH THE ENTIRE PANEL SURE I WILL OPEN UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS AT THAT POINT SO- WILL TURN OVER TO DENISE FOR. THE PRESENTATION THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I DON'T HAVE A PRESENTATION I'D DENISE EVER HARD ON THE DIVISION DISASTER EXECUTIVE FOR THE PACIFIC DIVISION FOR THE AMERICAN RED CROSS. SO MY TERRITORY IF IT'S THE STATE A COMMONWEALTH OR TERRITORY IN IT TOUCHES THE PACIFIC OCEAN. I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PREPARING RESPONDING AND RECOVERING TO DESERVE TO DISASTERS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WERE BROKEN INTO SIX REGIONS AND THAT WAY WE HAVE RED CROSSERS IN COMMUNITIES ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE RESPONDING EVERY DAY HELPING PEOPLE PREPARE EVERY DAY. AND STAYING THERE THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM RECOVERY WE ARE A 90% VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION SO ON DISASTERS WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH CAL CAL VOLUNTEERS ON A CALIFORNIA COURT PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING IN THESE REGIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY. WORKING ON PREPAREDNESS NOW FOR US PREPAREDNESS IS NOT JUST PREPAREDNESS FOR DISASTERS NUMBER ONE DISASTER WE GO ON EVERY DAY IS A HOME FIRE. AND SO WE'VE USED THAT THAT DISASTER AND OUR EFFORTS AROUND THAT TO INFORM THE LARGER DISASTER PREPAREDNESS SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE ALSO MAPPED OUT THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS BY INSTALLING SMOKE ALARMS THE ADVANTAGE OF INSTALLING A SMOKE ALARM IS YOU'RE BRINGING SOMETHING TO THEM THEY INVITE US INTO THEIR HOUSE. AND THEN WE CAN SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THE LARGER EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS- WE ARE TARGETING AND- TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATION. SOCIAL YOU VULNERABLE AND AS WELL AS ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE- AND SO WE'RE DOING A LOT OF EFFORTS AROUND THAT. TO REALLY TRY AND HELP THOSE POPULATIONS GET PREPARED. AS FAR AS DISASTERS GO EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THE RED CROSS THAT SHELTERING. I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS IF YOU DON'T YOU KNOW NOW- AND WE ARE OFTEN THE FIRST LINE OPENING SHELTERS IN MIGHT BE AN EVACUATION CENTER JUST WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES WITH NO NOTICE AND FIND A PLACE TO STAY. OR A LONGER TERM SHELTER I WILL TELL YOU THE DISASTERS ARE CHANGING. WE KEEP SEEING THIS IS THE LARGEST WILDFIRE WE'VE EVER SEEN IT'S THE MOST ACREAGE IT'S THE MOST FATALITIES IT'S THE MOST LOS HOMES. WE'RE ALSO SEEING A HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THE STATE. AND AS A RESULT WE'RE SHELTERING LONGER. WE DO OTHER THINGS IN OUR SHELTERS AND WE DO OTHER THINGS AS PART OF OUR RESPONSE WERE PART OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY EFFORT. SO WE ALSO DO FEEDING. OR WE WORK WITH PARTNERS TO DEFEATING I THINK ABBY MENTIONED SOME OF THEN THE SALVATION ARMY WORLD CENTRAL KITCHEN WE HAVE PARTNERS. WHO STEP IN AND HELP AT THE STATE WHAT WE DO IS WE PUT TOGETHER WHAT IS CALLED THE TASK FORCE. AND OFTEN TIMES THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WILL GRAB A ROLE IN THE TASK FORCE WE GRAB SHELTERING SALVATION ARMY ON THE LAST ONE GRAM FEEDING- AND WE KIND OF. PARSE OUT THE WORK. BIG DISASTERS OF ALSO CHANGE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WE RESPONDED. TO THE FIRES- I'LL BE HONEST THE SOCIAL MEDIA OUT LACKS WE HAD ON UNSOLICITED DONATIONS AND THE USE OF VOLUNTEERS WAS REALLY A STRUGGLE FOR US WE CHANGED OUR POLICIES. SO NOW WHEN PEOPLE DO BRING UNSOLICITED DONATIONS THE STUFF FROM YOUR CLOSET TO A SHELTER WE PUT IT IN A BOX TRUCK AND WE TRY AND FIND A PARTNER. TO HELP US SORT AND WASH AND PUT THAT THOSE THINGS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY NEED THEM SAME THING WITH VOLUNTEERS A LARGE PART OF OUR RESPONSE LAST YEAR TO THE CAMPFIRE. WAS WHAT WE CALL INVENT BASE VOLUNTEERS PEOPLE WHO SAID I SEE THIS AWFUL DISASTER I WANT TO HELP AND SO OUR GOAL IS TO REALLY TRY AND BRING THEM IN THE DOOR AND PUT THEM TO WORK. THAT WAY THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITIES DO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A PIECE OF THIS DISASTER. ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS TO COME OUT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS OF DISASTERS IS. AND IN SOME WAY WITH ABBY'S HELP WE'VE GOTTEN BETTER AT IT- BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS TO SEE. WHAT DISASTER COSTS COULD BE REFUNDABLE BY FEMA. AND KIND OF SHIFT SOME OF THOSE THINGS OVER TO THE STATE AND THE STATE WAS DOING THOSE THAT ENABLED US TO PUT A LOT MORE MONEY INTO LONG TERM RECOVERY. SO WE'RE WORKING IN THE COMMUNITY IS STILL ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRES WERE ACTUALLY STILL WORKING ON SOME OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN FIRES. BUT WE'RE DOING NOT ONLY FUNDS FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT GRANTS TO COMMUNITIES AND TRYING TO HELP THEM BUILD UP THEIR CAPACITY TO RECOVER FROM DISASTERS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO CHANGE THE FACE OF NOT ONLY DISASTER RESPONSE BUT DISASTER RECOVERY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AS PART OF THAT WERE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVE IN DISASTERS. AND SETTING UP LOCAL LONG TERM RECOVERY COMMITTEES. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR DURING THE CAMP FIRE THAT WAS A REAL STRUGGLE FOR US WE SHELTERED FOR NINETY NINE DAYS. THE RED CROSS THAT THAT IS NOT OUR MODEL TO SHELTER FOR NINETY NINE DAYS NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR US TO DO AND HARD FOR ALL OF OUR PARTNERS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. BECAUSE IT'S HARD FOR THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY DISASTERS AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO START LOOKING AT IS WITH THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THIS STATE. WHEN PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOME WHEN A TOWN LIKE PARADISE LEASES FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES WHAT IS THE SOLUTION. NORMALLY WE FIND MY A RENTAL OR ANOTHER HOUSE THEY GET INSURANCE AND THEY MOVE ON WE HAD PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT FIND A NEW PLACE TO LIVE- AND THEY STAYED IN OUR SHELTERS AND SAID THAT IS WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE A WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THE DISASTERS THAT I DO THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON- BUT THE PREPAREDNESS PART. IS ALSO GOING TO HELP THIS THE MORE WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO. HAVE THE SUPPLIES THEY NEED TO EVACUATE THE MORE WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO HAVE THE INSURANCE THEY NEED TO RECOVER AND TO HAVE A PLAN THE BETTER OFF WE ARE AND THAT'S WHERE THIS PARTNERSHIP HIS IS REALLY GOING TO HELP US CHANGE. THAT FACE OF DISASTER. THANK. THANK YOU ARE AND I WILL HEAR FROM OUR LAST ANALYST WITH DIRECT RELIEF. EXCUSE ME I EVERYONE- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THE MONNING GRAY FOR HAVING US I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK IT'S A PERFECT SEGUE FOR US AS- THE RED CROSS IS GREAT WORK- PROVIDING- HUMAN SUPPORT- VOLUNTEERS- IN PARTICULAR AND FROM DIRECTLY CAMP POINT WHERE A MEDICAL RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS SO WE BRING. A RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH NEEDS- WERE FOUNDED IN SANTA BARBARA- FOR THOSE OF YOU TO ADD THE DON'T KNOW WE'VE BEEN AROUND ABOUT SEVENTY YEARS AND OUR PRINCIPAL FOCUS IS ENGAGING WITH- MEDICAL MANUFACTURES- HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY TO RECEIVE DONATED MEDICINE SUPPLIES. AND OTHER- MEDICAL GOODS AT OUR FACILITY HEARING TO LEAD TO AN INTER DEPLOY THOSE TWO PROVIDERS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE WE WERE IN ABOUT A HUNDRED COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND THEN WITHIN THE UNITED STATES ALL FIFTY UNITED STATES- AROUND THE PROVISION OF HEALTH SERVICES- TYPICALLY VIA- FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER SCREENSHOT OF A CLINICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. SO I THINK I THIS PANEL WAS PERFECT WE'VE LONG WORKED- IN CALIFORNIA SINCE OUR INCEPTION- AND WITH ABBY AND HER TEAM AT- CALLOW YES REALLY AS AN ENTITY THAT WORKS TO LEVERAGE THE DONATIONS FROM- INDUSTRY AND ENCOURAGE THE- SORT OF PARTICIPATION AMONG PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO. PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN RELIEF SERVICES- I CAN TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF QUICK EXAMPLES- TO THAT AND ON THE NETWORK THAT WE'VE BUILT OUT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED- CARE PROVIDERS AGAIN THOSE CLINICS HEALTH CENTERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THEY IN TURN BASICALLY ARE ABLE TO- BE APPROVED TO RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM DREXEL LEAF WHICH REQUIRES AN APPLICATION AND VETTING PROCESS OF THEIR MEDICAL LICENSE. AND THEN DEMONSTRATION THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING CARE TO OF HONORABLY- ARE VULNERABLE MEDICAL POPULATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THAT WHEN A PERSON SEES HAPPEN- WE ALREADY HAVE AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP A CONTACT OF TOUCH POINTS IN A COMMUNITY THAT'S AFFECTED- SO MOST RECENTLY FOR INSTANCE IN A FEW COUNTY- WITH THE CAMPFIRE WE HAD EXISTING RELATIONS. WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN THE FIRES BROKE OUT- OUR GOAL THEN WAS. LIFE ANY MEDICAL RESOURCES THAT WERE NEEDED FOR THEIR RESPONSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICAL SHELTERS- FIRST BY CONTACTING OUT BEING HELLO YES AS A MEMBER OF THE BUSINESS OPERATION CENTER THAT WE'VE BEEN A PART OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THEN THOSE EXISTING HEALTH CARE ENTITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH THAN WHAT THOSE MEDICAL NEEDS ARE AND THEN TO TRY TO LEVERAGE THOSE DONATIONS- FROM- INDUSTRY. SO WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE- COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NINETY FIVE MASS OF OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS NEBULIZERS INHALERS- AND THEN WHEN THE MEDICAL SHELTERS FORMED- GIVEN THE- AMOUNT OF EVACUATIONS- THAT OCCURRED- WE'RE AVAIL. ABLE TO EQUIP WITH- MEDICAL KITS- OUR HEALTH KIDS TO COUNTY HEALTH- PROFESSIONALS- ALL THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEEDED TO PROVIDED HEALTH CARE- FOR THAT SEVERAL WEEK PERIOD IN THE- THE INITIAL RECOVERY EFFORTS- SO THAT'S- KIND OF ONE EXAMPLE. HERE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY- WE HAVE A LONG TIME RELATIONSHIP WITH- SANTA BARBARA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH IS PART OF THAT YES AT EIGHT FUNCTION OUR WORK WITH- THAT- EM- WERE REALLY AGAIN. HELPING TO BOLSTER AND ANY LOCAL EVENT THAT OCCURS AND ACCESS RESOURCES ON BEHALF OF. I COUNTY OFFICIALS AND OTHER LOCAL NGOS. SEIZES WE COULD TRYING TO LEVERAGE ANY FUNDING THAT- CAME OUR WAY AND THEN ALSO WITH MEDICAL MATERIAL- NAMELY DO A QUICK PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING BACK INTO THEIR HOMES FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER THE DEBRIS FLOW WITH PROTECTIVE SUITS GLOVES GOGGLES. MASKS THINK THAN THEY NEEDED TO BECOME SAFE WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO- ACCESS VACCINES TO ENSURE EVERYBODY WAS VACCINATED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT- AS THEY WENT BACK IN- TO- THEIR HOMES. AND I THINK LASTLY WHAT WE'VE SEEN A LARGER ROLE IN- THAT PUBLIC PRIVATE- PARTNERSHIP IN CONNECTION IS SUPPORT OF LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS- HERE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IN ADDITION TO BUTTE AND INTER COUNTY- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN AS AN ORGANIZATION IS THAT WILLINGNESS TO HELP. AND AS ABBIE REFERENCE CASH IS A REALLY GREAT WAY TO QUICKLY MOVING TO PROVIDE THOSE REALLY SPECIFIC RESOURCES THAT. FOLKS NEED AND WE RECOGNIZE HERE IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY- SOME ARE LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEEDED TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING. BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU REALLY COULD NEVER FOR CAT HAVE FORECAST WHAT HAPPENS RIGHT. SO WE PURCHASED NUMBER OF VEHICLES- ATVS SEARCH AND RESCUE YEAR- AND TRY TO BASICALLY PROVIDE A PIPELINE FOR PRIVATE DONATIONS INTO. A QUICK- LOCAL FIRST RESPONDERS- AND THEN I THINK VERY LASTLY- THIS IS SORT OF A STANDING INVITATION FOR ANYBODY HERE TO COME VISIT US. WE HAVE A BRAND NEW FACILITY THAT WAS PURPOSE BUILT- FOR OUR ORGANIZATION AND REALLY WE SEE IT AS A PUBLIC ASSET- THAT'S RUN BY A NONPROFIT. IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT WAREHOUSE- FACILITY IT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT THE ST STE IN THE UNITED STATES AS A NONPROFIT WHOLESALE PHARMACY. UP FOR WHAT WE DO HAVE A- CALL THAT WE REFERRED AT. ALL IT'S A BASICALLY COMMUNITY ORGANIZING- SPACE THAT WE CAN USE TO HOST EVENTS. MEETINGS THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO ANYBODY HERE. THAT NEEDS TO THAT- SPACE PLEASE. LET US KNOW AND THEN IN ADDITION I THINK RELATED TO THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT OR IN. THOSE WITH POWER LOSS PARTICULAR- WE HAVE NINE HUNDRED NINETY NINE SOLAR POWER. AND THEN A GENERATOR WE BASICALLY STOPS A LITTLE MICRO BREAD- WHICH IS IN ABILITY THAN FOR US TO STAY ON WITH POWER DURING ANY EVENT THE IDEA BEING THAT THE PANELS CAN CHARGE DURING THE DAY AND THEN IF WE NEED TO TAP A DIESEL GENERATOR TO RUN I WE CAN AND THE PURPOSE THERE'S TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN STAY OPERATIONAL TO REALLY SUPPORT- STATE AND LOCAL NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH- MAJOR EVENTS- SO AGAIN STANDING INVITATION TO COME VISIT AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO. BE PART OF THIS PANEL. Q. I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE FEEDBACK AND- THAT THE PRESENTATIONS AND INFORMATION I HAVE ONE QUESTION. IT SOUNDS LIKE A- REGRETTABLY WE'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCE THEM MORE RECENTLY OR OVER THE YEARS BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT STILL RISES IN IN THE MOMENTS IS HOW HOW DOES A COMMUNITY DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC ROLES OF RESPONSE- IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE IN- IN THAT SPACE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF. AND SO IN THIS MOMENT WERE NICE WERE CALM WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER'S ROLES. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT TO A PARTICULAR IN THE FIRST FORTY EIGHT TO. YOU KNOW FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO WEEK IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHO'S DOING WHAT DEPENDING YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SOME QUESTIONS ARE THERE GREATER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC ROLES BETWEEN NON NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. UP PARTICULARLY TO MAXIMIZE- IMPACT- THE DISASTERS ARE GETTING BIGGER NOT SMALLER YEAH OF ALL THE SEND MAYBE EVERYONE'S TO ADD TO THIS- I THINK REALLY THE WHAT WE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT- COORDINATING BODIES IN THE CAR IN A COUNTY- IS THE BOW AT THE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION ACTIVE IN DISASTER ALL THOSE ENTITIES. THAT IDEALLY ARE INVOLVED IN A RESPONSE THAT REALLY SHOULD KNOW EACH OTHER AND AS EXIT A GREAT EXAMPLE IN BUTTE THEY DIDN'T HAVE A BOW OUT SET UP. AND THESE VOTE ORGANIZATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT. WE HAVE CHARLENE HERE WHO'S. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUT OF AT HI. I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT BEAU ADS OR IN THEIR SOMETIMES CALLED CO ADDS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACTIVE IN DISASTERS CAN BE AN ORGANIZING BODY CAN DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THAT. PEOPLE CAN KNOW EACH OTHER BEFORE THE INCIDENT. THAT THAT THAT STRUCTURE I THINK IS A REALLY SOUND ONE- AND IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT ALL SEE ABOUT BEING WITH TO ADD. I'M SURE WELL IT THE VOTE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND UNFORTUNATELY- SANTA BARBARA COUNTY HAS HAD LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH DISASTERS LATELY. SO YOUR VOTE IS QUITE STRONG HERE AND SO WHEN NON PROFITS RISE UP OR PEOPLE RISE UP AND THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS THEY CAN KIND OF FINAL THEMSELVES INTO THIS OF- OUT SYSTEM- BUT- ARE HONESTLY. DISASTERS ARE SO BIG THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM FOR EVERYONE TO PARTICIPATE. AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS THROUGH OUR DIFFERENT LAYERS OF CONNECTIONS WITH THE VOEPEL WE HAVE A REGIONAL BOW OUT AND THEN WE HAVE OUR- OUR STATEWIDE THE LAD AND LIKE CURRENT MISSION WITH CHARLENE HERE. AND WE TRY TO COORDINATE THAT WE TRY TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND TRY TO HELP AND ASSIST THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY DO. WHAT THEY DO BEST THAT WE PRACTICE CONSTANTLY AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATING OUR PLANS. AND TRYING TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY- IT'S DIFFICULT DURING STEADY STATE BUT. WE'LL DO NOT HAVE- THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO FAR BACK TO THINK ABOUT WHEN THE LAST DISASTER WAS. AND SO THEY'RE OFTEN WILLING TO COME IN AND SO THAT THAT'S KIND OF HOW WE COORDINATE BUT- EVERY DISASTERS DIFFERENT AND SO THEY ALL. A CHAMPIONS AND LEADERS WILL RISE OUT OF A DISASTER AND IT WE GRAB THEM AND PUT THEM TO WORK. THANK YOU. SEVERAL QUESTIONS. BALDING AS AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK. IT IS THE ADDRESSES IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TO STANDARDIZE PRACTICE. AND I KNOW THROUGH MY OWN EXPERIENCE- INVOLVED BUT I STORE MERCED TO COMMITTEES I REPRESENT A WHICH IN TWO DIFFERENT COUNTIES WE ARE WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS AND TRYING TO THE. THE MOST CHALLENGING THING I'VE FOUND IS GETTING ALL OF THE NON PROFITS THAT WORK IN HOMELESSNESS TO COORDINATE THE WAY THAT SUFFICIENT IN A WAY THAT WE'RE NOT DUPLICATIVE OF WORK AND RESOURCES AND SO ON IN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES. AND IT STRIKES ME. YOUR THAT IS CERTAINLY THIS HEARING TODAY BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW I AS WE CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. COMMERCIALLY CAMPAIGN. WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS AND WE ESTABLISH STANDARDS STRUCTURE THROUGH THAT WHEN IS THAT PROGRAM- COULD BE EXPANDED TO ALL COUNTIES. ARE. ONE IS AND HOW DO WE AUDIT OR OR OR- YOUR BEST KEEP TRACK OF LESSONS LEARNED. GOING TO DISASTERS ARE GREAT QUESTIONS- I KNOW WHEN I WAS FORMERLY THE CHIEF SERVICE OFFICER CALIFORNIA VOLUNTEERS IN CHARGE OF AMERICORPS VOLUNTEERS AND DONATIONS FOR DISASTERS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SURPRISED ME COMING INTO THE JOB IS THAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT WOULD HAVE INDUSTRY GROUP INFORMATION ABOUT LIKE ALL THE NON PROFITS IN THE HOMELESS ARENA ALL THE NONPROFIT. DOING TUTORING IN EDUCATION LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE AN ASSET THAT THE STATE MUST BE TRACKING AND ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE WAS NO SUCH DOCUMENTS. AND THERE ARE ASSOCIATION FOR SOME NONPROFIT KIND OF INDUSTRY GROUPS FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM. BUT BUT THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT I KNOW OF THAT IS FORMALLY SET UP ACROSS TO ALL ISSUES. SO YOU'VE GOT THAT KIND OF COMPLICATION- AND SECONDLY AS FAR AS THEY'RE THE KIND OF THE GROWTH EXPANSION OF LEAST US I MEAN. REACHING A CONCENTRATE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES. WILL BE ARE ARE KIND OF. WHAT I HOPE WILL BE PHASE ONE. WE LOOK AT THOSE RESULTS RIGHT WE SEE THE STRATEGIES THAT WE TRY AND THEY ARE ALL BEING CAPTURED IN REPORTS- AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- WE ARE HOPING TO COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU UPDATES ON. OUR OUR PROGRESS AND MY HOPE IS THAT IF IT DOES PROVE TO BE AS EFFECTIVE IN THIS KIND OF I THINK NATION LEADING OF A PRACTICE AS I THINK IT IS. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL LOVE TO EXPAND IT- BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO WAIT AND SEE HOW IT GOES. DO YOU THINK THE. AN AUDIT LIKE A STATE AUDIT AUDIT TO GOING TO LOOK AT BEST PRACTICES WOULD BE USEFUL. WELL I IF YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY PREPAREDNESS. BEST PRACTICES OR I CAN I CAN LET YOU KNOW AS PART OF THE LEASES CALIFORNIA PROJECT WE'RE DOING A FULL BLOWN INVENTORY IT'S LIKE AN AUDIT OF ALL OF THE PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGNS BOTH FEDERAL STATE LOCAL. I'M AND THOSE THAT ARE GEARED TOWARD WILD FIRE EARTHQUAKE AND FLOOD SAID IT CAN INFORM THE CURRICULUM THAT WE'RE GETTING OUT THERE. BUT AS FAR AS A AS A KIND OF AN AUDIT IF YOU'RE REFERRING MORE TO THE POPULATIONS IN THE NONPROFIT. I WASN'T SURE WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING MORE TO I WAS SPECIFIC FOR TO THE- OFFERING A AUDIT LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE TO CHURCH OR OTHERS ABOUT IT. STATE AUDITOR WHICH OFTENTIMES. I FIND AGENCIES- LOOK AT THE STATE OUR OFFICES CAN OF A PUNITIVE ACTION. RIGHT WHEN IN FACT MY VIEW THE SAY OURSELVES I USED TO CHAIR THE COMMITTEE IS THAT WE HAVE THE IMMENSE ASSET IN THE STATE AUDITOR AND- ALL THE EMPLOYEES OVER THERE AND THEY LOOK AT. PROGRAMS AND OF COURSE THEY ACROSS DIFFERENT AGENCIES I AM A COME BACK WITH JUST TREMENDOUS COMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE IT'S A TOOL I THINK WE OUGHT TO USE A LOT MORE. MONIQUE AND I AND OUR COLLEAGUES- BUT I JUST CURIOUS IF THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO DO AN INTERNAL AUDIT. RIGHT WHAT YOU CAN DO YOUR PROGRAMS BUT IT'S HARD TO SOMETIMES GET AFTER THE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK MY FAVORITE. OF IDEA THE WILL THE ONE THING I TO SPEAK TO IS THAT THERE'S- COUNTLESS STATE AGENCIES ALL THAT HAVE PARTNERSHIPS. WITH THE NONPROFIT COMMUNITY RIGHT- DIFFERENT GRANT PROGRAMS SO IF THERE WOULD BE A WAY TO KIND OF CONSOLIDATE ALL THAT INFORMATION ABOUT THE IDEA I THINK THAT WOULD. BE REALLY INTERESTING. AN INTERESTING IDEA. SO I ALSO DID WANT TO ADD THAT THERE THERE'S WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AN ORGANIZATIONAL MECHANISM. THERE'S PREPARED AND THEN THERE'S RESPONSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE RED CROSS WE DEMO YOU WITH CALORIE YES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT OUTLINES WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IN CASE OF A DISASTER. NOT ONLY UNFUNDED BY THE WAY NOT ONLY THAT BUT- WE ALSO HAVE EIGHT THE TASK FORCE STRUCTURE THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AT THE STATE THAT EXISTS I CAN'T AT THE COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT LEVEL SO THAT IS A REPEATABLE. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PRETTY ESTHER RESPONSE AND THAT WE'RE REAPING THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ORDINATING AT ENTITY WITH I'M BETTER AT IT IF THEY THERE THERE'VE BEEN SOME HICCUPS ALONG THE WAY. BUT THAT STRONG COUNTY EMERGENCY MA'AM. DISASTERS ALWAYS START LOCALLY. IF THE IF THEY FOLLOW THE STRUCTURE THAT SET. THEY'LL HAVE A BLACK REPRESENTATIVE THE HAVE A RED CROSS REPRESENTATIVE THEY'LL HAVE ALL OF THE AGENCIES IN THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND THAT IS THE KEY TO COORDINATING THE DISASTER RESPONSE. YEAH I COMPLETELY HERE YOU'RE SAYING AT A FOR OUR ORGANIZATION WE'VE BEEN AUDITED SOMETHING LIKE FIFTY OR SIXTY TIMES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MEDICINE IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE. BUT FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE AUDIT IS IMPUTED VÀ NATURE'S MUCH AS IT'S TO DEMONSTRATE THE BEST MODELS THAT EXIST IN WHERE TO SORT OF POINT YOURSELF. I TRY TO A FIRE TO BE HAVE A GOAT'S WANTING MY WE FOCUS REALLY HEAVILY ON COMPLIANCE BUT I THINK RELATED TO THAT THESE CONCEPTS AND WHAT DID YOU JUST TOUCHED ON I THINK WHAT ALBEIT AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS CENTER AT THE TIME TO BE THAT PUBLIC PRIVATE WORKING GROUP SO THAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED READ. ASSET AND ROLES AS AN EMERGENCY SO THEN YOU HAVE SOME CLARITY DURING AN EVENT WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES WHO CAN YOU RELY ON HOW YOU ACCESS THINGS YOU MAY NOT EVER HAVE THOUGHT YOU NEEDED. AND THAT STRUCTURE PROVIDES THAT AND THEN I KNOW HERE LOCALLY WITH ARE AWARE PREPARE INITIATIVE WE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT AS WELL TRYING TO BREAK- BRIDGE THOSE- PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN CITY OFFICIALS COUNTY OFFICIALS AND THEN THE LOCAL NONPROFITS THROUGH BOW OUT OR OR OTHER MEANS- AND THEN I THINK LASTLY IT'S ENSURING FROM OUR STANDPOINT IS A NONPROFIT AND I THINK IT. OTHER NONPROFITS HERE TRYING TO BE VERY GOOD AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS SO THAT WHEN AN EMERGENCY HAPPENS YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO RECREATE WE ALL YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO DO THINGS YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. YOU HAVE ASSISTING RELATIONSHIPS NOT THINK COMP NOTE COMBINATION OF THOSE FACTORS ARE GONNA HELP- PROMOTE MORE. EFFICIENCY AND GREATER ACTIVITY IN RELIEF EFFORTS. I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN IN THIS PRESENTATION WE HEARD ABOUT TWO ISSUES THAT I THINK EVERY SINGLE COMMUNITY IS- IN CALIFORNIA. IS GRAPPLING WITH ONE IS- THE NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES AND- IN GENERAL THE PARTICULAR ANY TIME OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE. AND THE SECOND ONE IS HOUSING. AT CAN YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO DO. WHAT YOU'RE SEEN AND WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT TO SEE IN THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF NONPROFITS COORDINATING WITH GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR MAYBE NOT QUITE MEETING BUT HAVING DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT THESE TWO ISSUES I KNOW THAT. IN THE LEGISLATURE THOSE ARE NOT LITTLE ISSUES THOSE ARE REALLY BIG ISSUES THAT. EVERY COUNTY GRAPPLING WITH IN IN A IN A VERY DIFFICULT WAY. SURE I CAN SPEAK VERY BROADLY ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO VERY VERY BIG ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY I HAVE A MENTAL ANXIETY AND SO THEREFORE I SEE THE NEED AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE SOME OF THE TRAUMA THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DURING THESE DISASTERS AND SO I AM WORKING WITH OUR- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY THE NEW SECRETARY ON FORMING SOME KIND OF A TASK FORCE FOR CRISIS COUNSELING. AND BRING PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE THE PRIVATE SECTOR YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL THESE TELEHEALTH THERE'S ALL THE DOCTORS OUT THERE EVERYBODY WANTS TO GIVE BACK BUT SOMEBODY HAS TO COORDINATE THAT FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND THEN WE HAVE TO BRING IN THE NON PROFITS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY WORKING ON IT AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON WITH YOU HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. TO BRING THAT TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS A IT IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER JUST THE RIDGE CREST EARTHQUAKE THOSE PEOPLE WITH THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF TROOPS CONSTANTLY AFTERWARDS. OF. WE HAD TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING AND SO THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON BUT- AS YOU KNOW AS AS EVERYONE KNOWS MENTAL HEALTH HAS. A LONG WAY TO GO AND- THERE'S A STIGMA RELATED TO IT WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK THAT DOWN BECAUSE IT'S OKAY. TO WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY AFTER YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A HORRENDOUS OF IT LIKE THAT. A REGARDING THE HOUSING I KNOW THE GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS A- MASSIVE PLAN AND IT'S THROUGH THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING. AND SO I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THAT BUT I DO KNOW IT IS HAPPENING SO. THE ONLY THING I'LL CHIME IN ON- HELP- SOME REAL ESTATE INSPIRING MODEL. TURNING TO ROLL OUT LIKE KAISER PERMANENT DAYS WORK FOR CATHOLIC CHARITIES TO EIGHT I'M A MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. THAT YOU CAN BE TRAINED IN. AND THIS IS A SPECIAL I THINK IMPORTANT FOR THOSE IN THE NONPROFIT FIELD. THAT OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES IN THE FRONT LINE OF WORK. PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE STRUGGLES AND THEY THEMSELVES DON'T REALIZE HOW THE TWO MAY BE DEVELOPING. DIFFERENT ISSUE IS. THERE IN THIS VERY INTENSE ENVIRONMENT. AND. SO I THINK THERE'S EXCITING MODELS LIKE THAT OUT THERE AS WELL. AND I'LL ADD ON TO THAT WHAT WORRIES. ME IS WITH THIS EVERY YEAR THESE LARGE FIRE THESE. DISASTERS IS THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO. WHAT YOU KNOW WE STRUGGLE WITH THIS AND THE RED CROSS ARE RESPOND OR IS. THE ONES THAT RESPONDED TO THE CAMPFIRE SOME OF THEM IT RESPONDED SANTA ROSA THE YEAR BEFORE- I DID YOU SEE YOU TODAY THAT THERE'S A DOCUMENTARY COMING OUT ON NETFLIX AND I WATCHED. THE PREVIEW FOR. FIRE AND THEY PUT ME RIGHT BACK THERE AND I DO THIS FOR A LIVING- WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ALL WORK TOGETHER AND TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN A RESPONSIBLE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IS THE NEXT TIME THE SKY TURNS DARK. THE NEXT TIME IT FEELS FULL OF SMOKE THERE IS WIDESPREAD ANXIETY- AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REALITY GOING FORWARD AND SO ANY KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN PUT TOGETHER. BOB HI MATT I THINK WILL MAKE ALL OF OUR RESPONSES STRONGER. YEAH I JUST ADD THAT- IN IN A LOT OF OUR DOMESTIC RELIEF OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS I THINK AGAIN WE RESPONDED TO. OUR EVENTS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS AND PROBABLY THE PAST TEN COMBINED- AND THE GROWING NEEDS ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT TOWARDS IS A RECOGNITION OF THE- THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF- MENTAL HEALTH. AND ACTUALLY HOW THAT CAN AFFECT EVEN CHRONIC DISEASE- AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH OF THIS COME OUT- THAT IS OLD RESEARCH BUT I THINK IT'S BEING REVISITED- RELATED TO TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AS AS A MODEL IN PARTICULAR- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK DONE AND THE ACES SPACE REGARDING. EVER ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENT AND HOW THOSE A FACT- HEALTH- RELATED TO TRAUMA INFORMED CARE- THEY SAY AFTER WITNESSING- SOMEBODY PASSED AWAY ONE OF THE MOST- SECOND- MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT- HAPPENED INDIVIDUALS IS- FOR- TRAUMA IS RELATED TO BEING. A PART OF OUR IN AN EMERGENCY WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE NO CONTROL- WE'VE SEEN A BIG MOVEMENT IN PORTER RICO TEXAS AND THEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN SHASTA IN SANTA ROSA AND- DEVELOPING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE PROGRAMS- IN FACT SOME OF THE HEALTH CENTERS THAT WERE WORKING WITH IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. TAKING IT SO FAR AS WHERE THEY'RE LOBBING THEIR STATE LEGISLATURE TO SEE IF THEY CAN GET COVERAGE. FOR BILLABLE VISITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROVISION OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE- THERE SOME GREAT WORK BEING DONE HERE LOCALLY I KNOW. AS WELL I THINK. MOVEMENT AROUND FROM INFORMED CARE IN TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH. A LOT OF SUCCESS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL NOTE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT ON HOUSING AND SO THAT WAS THAT PIECE THAT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS. THE DRILL DOWN FOR A MINUTE ON THE. BOTH THE BILL ITSELF FIRST I'M I'M KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT AMERICANS WE HAVE IN PLACE TO CASPER YES- IN ADVANCE OF. THIS DISASTER IS THE AND THEN SECOND YOU QUEUE YOU REFERRED TO THE- VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS- IN ASSISTING IN DISASTERS OF ADDS. WHAT EXISTS TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. IN LAWS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN WE ISSUE- GRANT FUNDING THIS IS NOT A REQUIREMENT. THESE ORGANIZATIONS REFINING PARTICIPATE IN THESE. COORDINATED RELIEF ACTIVITIES. I'M CERTAIN YOU GO WHERE YOU GO. I DO A LITTLE ROOM I WAS PREPARING TO ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION AND THEN YOU SAID THE SECOND QUESTION AND I. TOTALLY LOST THE FIRST QUESTION. SO WE COULD REPEAT THE FIRST WHICH IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAST OUR PREPARE US TESTER PROGRESS YES YES- WE DO HAVE EXERCISES WE ARE CONSTANTLY PRACTICING- THROUGH OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES BEYOND THE LOCAL LEVEL. AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE A MASSIVE EXERCISE THAT ATTACH TO THE DIFFERENT FLEET WEEKS OF AND WE TRY TO PRACTICE WHAT WE PREACH WHEN IT COMES IN AND WE ALWAYS TRY TO BRING IN OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS TO PRACTICE WITH US. SOMETIMES IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE EASIEST BECAUSE THEY HAVE DAY JOBS THEY HAVE TO KEEP THE ORGANIZATION RUNNING AND MANY OF THEM ARE ON LIKE A SHOE STRING BUDGET AS IT IS. AND SO BEING ABLE TO STEP OUT OF THAT TO PRACTICE THE PREPAREDNESS BUT WE DO ENCOURAGE IT AND WE TRY TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THEM. A REGARDING THE VO ADS AT THE MOMENT THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS OF SUPPORTING THEM. OUT IT'S A FINE LINE AND I'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VOTE WHETHER LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT IT AS TO HOW MUCH INPUT FROM THE STATE DO THEY ACTUALLY WANT- BECAUSE- WE LIKE TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NONPROFIT THEY DON'T WANT US TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO ALL THE TIME THEY THEY- DO WHAT THEY DO BEST- AND SO. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN HELP THEM BUILD UP THAT SUPPORT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. IS AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL HAVING- NONPROFITS BE INJECTED WITH EITHER CASH OR SUPPORT SERVICES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND MAKING THOSE CONNECTIONS FOR THEM. AND SO IT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON- AS THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS COMING IN. AND TRYING TO BUILD THAT UP BUT- AS I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY AWARE. CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIFFERENT AND VERY DIVERSE ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE VERY INDIVIDUAL THEY HAVE A INDIVIDUAL. NEEDS AND THEY HAVE INDIVIDUAL RESOURCES. AND SO BRINGING THEM ALL TOGETHER. IT'S A HERCULEAN TASK JUST TO BRING NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN TOGETHER TRYING TO BRING. ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TOGETHER AND HAVE SOMETHING STANDARDIZED ACROSS THE BOARD. IT IS NOT THE EASIEST THING BUT WE ARE WORKING ON IT. AND I'M TRYING TO ASSIST THEM IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN. ALL THE STAFF THAT WORK WITHOUT. SUPPORT DOLLARS VO ADDS AS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT- ARE KIND OF LEFT TO THEIR- OWN YOU KNOW BUDGETS AND THEIR OWN BAND WITH. TO BE ABLE TO GATHER THEIR PEERS TOGETHER. OF FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS A REALLY IMPORTANT COORDINATING BODY. BUT BUT IT'S NOT AS IF THEY HAVE A BUDGET FOR THAT UNLESS THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS PROVIDED IT IT'S NOT- A STREAM OF FINE SAID HELLO YES. HOUSE. CURRENTLY SO I'M JUST I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW THAT- AS I UNDERSTAND IT WE HAVE SIXTEEN VO ADS OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND- WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF DISASTERS. IN THE VAUD ADDS STRONG IN ALL OF OUR COUNTIES. OKAY AT THIS TIME OR DO SOME A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL PRACTICE WE DON'T HAVE. A LOT OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS HERE ARE FROM MY COMMITTEE OR MODE SELECT COMMITTEE- SORT OPEN UP TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS FROM. THE FOLKS IN ATTENDANCE AND HOPEFULLY THAT'LL ALLOW SOME OF YOU TO POTENTIALLY GET. ARE THE PANEL- HAVING SAID THAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH ONE HOUR OF OUR TWO HOURS THAT WE HAVE THIS ROOM. SO WILL MAYBE TAKE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE TO FIVE QUESTIONS THE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL AND REPEAT THAT. GOOD MORNING CATHY MARIE MAYOR OF SANTA BARBARA. WELCOME EVERYONE. FOR HER MY QUESTION IS ABOUT. AND ELECTRICITY- I'M ON THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS HERE IN SANTA BARBARA AND THE EQUIPMENT TO MEASURE POLLUTE IN AND FOR AWHILE A SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES DEPENDS ON POWER. SO I JUST WANTED TO KNOW. YOUR THOUGHTS ON LOSS OF POWER I MEAN DURING AN EMERGENCY WILL LOSE ELECTRICITY SO MAYBE WERE PREPARED ON SOME LEVEL BUT THERE'S THIS NEW- PS PS FROM THE- UTILITY COMPANIES. IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO FIND SOME LEVEL OF COMFORT AND SECURITY ON THAT SUBJECT THANK YOU. TAG. LIKE TO LOOK AT IT MAY. SAYS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO AND WE DO IT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE AFTER A DISASTER IF THERE IS A WHOLE EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTION WHICH IS HOW WE SET IT UP AROUND POWER AND SO FOR SHELTERING OR THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE DO DO WE GET GENERATORS WE TRYING TO FIND PLACES THAT ALREADY HAVE GENERATORS IN ADVANCE SO WE CAN SURE THAT THE SHELTER HAS. A GENERATOR- MY RULE OF THUMB IS THAT THE SHELTER MEANS POWER IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TOILETS- AND SO YOU KNOW THERE IS A THERE IS A STATE WIDE PLAN FOR AFTER A DISASTER- AS- AN AND WE CAN. USE THAT ENTITY AMERICORPS NATION THAT'S WHERE THE FEMALE LEVEL COMES IN AND GETS ESCALATED TO TRY AND HELP SOURCE THOSE GENERATORS THE. BILL FOR A DISASTER I'M GOING TO TURN TO YOU GUYS. HOW DO I DANCE MOVES OUT OF. THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT ALL SIR A HUGE ISSUE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA OPEN ON THE STATE- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS MORE PRACTICE AT AT THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND P. JEANNIE IN FACT WERE ACTIVATED RIGHT NOW HOURS OPERATIONS CENTER BECAUSE OF A- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF THAT IS HAPPENING. TONIGHT AT SUNSET I BELIEVE- AND THEN TOMORROW AND FRIDAY OR THE WORST DAYS FOR THE RED FLAG AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WHICH TRANSLATES TO ABOUT A MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED- IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- ARE. VERY WELL PREPARED FOR AND WE'RE CONSTANTLY PUSHING AND TRYING TO GET MORE INFORMATION. GOING ON WITH THE UTILITIES. TRYING TO HAVE THEM BE MORE US SURGICAL LIKE WITH HOW THEY'RE DOING IT THAT THE NEED IS DEFINITELY THAT THERE WE WE'VE SEEN THAT. BUT HOW THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT HAS NOT BEEN- UP TO OUR FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOME. AND HOW THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO HANDLE IT AND SO. ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PUSH AND PUSH AND PUSH AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY AT THE READY. TO TRY TO DO THAT- MY JOB DURING THAT DURING THOSE KIND OF EVENTS IS TO DEAL WITH THE BUSINESS ASPECT OF IT BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW YOU LOSE YOUR REFRIGERATION FOR FIVE DAYS. THERE GOES YOUR WHOLE THING AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT I WAS ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY WITH UNION PACIFIC BECAUSE THEY'RE. SIGNALING RUN ON ELECTRICITY AND THEY WEREN'T GETTING INFORMATION FROM THE UTILITIES AS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD PUT THE GENERATORS. I MEAN IT WAS JUST. UP CONSTANTLY TRYING TO GET MORE AND MORE INFORMATION AND WE ARE MAKING HEADWAY- BUT IT'S STILL WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO SO WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT. YEAH I WOULD JUST ADD I THINK IT'S A IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE AND I THINK A LOT OF IT OF COURSE YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT I THINK- POWER OUTAGES OUT TALK ABOUT SOLAR IN SOME CAPACITY AND I THINK WHAT'S- THE- PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS. A SHIFT WHERE IT LOOKED AT HELLO WHAT IS THE LONG TERM SORT OF INVESTMENT IN RETURN ON SOLAR NOW IT'S MORE OF AN EMERGENCY NEED TO HOW DO I STAY. ACTIVE AND- OPENED DURING AN EVENT- WE PUT THOSE RESOURCES IN AT OUR FACILITY IN ENSURING NOT JUST SOLAR BUT ALSO THE BACKUP BATTERIES AS WELL. ABBIE ALLUDED TO REFRIGERATION THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR US FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED ACCESS TO INSULIN'S AND VACCINES IF WE SHIP STUFF AND THEN IT GOES TO A- GREATER NAY LOSE POWER- WITH THIS SURVEY RECENTLY AND FOUND ABOUT HALF OF THE- CLINICS CALIFORNIA THAT WE WERE SUPPORTING HAD NO. ALTERNATIVE BACKUP POWER SOURCES TO WE'VE BEEN ACTUALLY INVESTING MORE IN THAT AREA- MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S HERE WHO HIT OVERSEEN OLIVER. IMPORTER GO ALL OF THE HEALTH PROVIDERS IMPORTER I HAVE JUST RADICALLY RETHOUGHT THE PROVISION OF HEALTH WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT POWER RIGHT AND THAT THIRD NO THEY- GET HIT WITH POWER OUTAGES AGAIN. SO WE'VE DONE SOLAR AND- FOR ALL OF THE HEALTH CLINICS. IMPORTER RICO AND I THINK ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO READ. ACTIVITY LOCAL. ABOUT SOLAR AN ASSOCIATE A BACKUP BATTERIES I THINK IN IT AND WE'RE ALSO NOW STARTING TO STOCK WORKABLE BATTER- THAT OUR SOUL IS NOT JUST GENERATORS BUT BATTERIES CAN BE CHARGED VIA SOLAR AND DEPLOYED OUT OF WE WERE CLOSE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE COPD OR. MACHINE THAT NEED AT. A POWER SOURCE SO IT'S DEFINITELY AN INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S JUST CHANGING THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOLAR IS THIS LONG. INVESTMENT THAT IS GOING TO PAY OFF SOME RETURN TO NOW THE NEEDED INVESTMENT BECAUSE AS P. JEANNIE STATED THE CO I THINK IT'S- TEN YEARS- THEY HE ESTIMATED THAT. CALIFORNIA WILL BE IN THIS P. S. P. S. MODE IS WE TRY TO SOURCE OUT AT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE ASSOCIATED- WINS AND THEN FIRES AND THE POWER. LÀ WITH IT. QUESTION HERE. MY NAME IS SHERRIN BURN AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MUNCIE TO ASSOCIATION AND WE WENT THROUGH THE- THIS WEEKEND WITH THE P. S. P. S. RIGHT SO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A SOLAR POWERED MICRO GREAT FOR THE LAST YEAR FOR ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GOT A WHOLE LOT OF INTEREST. IN FINISHING THAT OUT RIGHT FOR THIS VERY REASON. SO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SOME. REALLY MONTHS OFFICE ABOUT THIS IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOING- THROUGH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO ENABLE MORE COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO SOLAR POWERED MICRO. A SECOND QUESTION FOR YET WHICH IS I ALSO CHAIR OF THE BEHAVIOR ONE THIS COMMISSION FOR THIS COUNTY- AND HAVE PARENTS IMPORTER RICO- THAT WENT THROUGH HURRICANES IRMA AND MARIA. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- IT'S WELL KNOWN THE PORTER RICO AND CUBA HAVE THE BEST TRAUMA MEDICINE IN THE WORLD. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY GO THROUGH SO MANY. HURRICANES SANTA BARBARA COUNTY- BEHAVIOR WELLNESS HAS HAD TO DO SO. MUCH MENTAL HEALTH DISASTER RESPONSE. PREPAREDNESS YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY. THAT I THINK WE MIGHT BE BEST IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF. HOW TO DELIVER THAT MODEL VERY FOR TO BLEED INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND I'D LOVE TO SEE IF. YOU KNOW WE'VE REPORTED ON THIS TO THE STATE BEHAVIOR WELLNESS- COMMISSION OVERSIGHT BOARD- I'D LOVE TO SEE. OTHER COUNTY BE ABLE LEARN FROM OUR COUNTY ON HOW TO DO THAT. I'M GONNA JUMP IN ON- RESPONSE FOR THE STATE TO I KNOW MY OFFICE IS CURRENTLY LOOKING AT AT THE AUDIT WHICH ABOUT ON ITS EARLIER OF THE CPC- BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. OF ALL SAY IT'S BEEN MISREPORTED OR PERHAPS NOT JUST. NOT REPORTED- IN ENOUGH DETAIL- IS THE FACT THE PROCEEDINGS CPUC HAVE INVOLVED INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES RIGHT. START POURING THROUGH SOME OF THE- PREVIOUS- PROPOSALS THEY'VE BEEN PUT FORTH BY VARIOUS PARTIES AND FOR EXAMPLE. THE PLAN TO REPLACE WOULD POLLS. IS CURRENTLY SET AT TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO REPLACE ALL THE POLLS WHICH STRIKES ME AS ODD BECAUSE WHEN POLLS DON'T LAST TWO HUNDRED YEARS. AND I SUSPECT WE START DIGGING A LITTLE DEEPER WE'RE GONNA FIND A REAL LACK OF EFFORT- ON PERHAPS- THROUGH CP HE'S CPU SEES PART. ALSO WE HAVE TO TAKE SOME RESPONSIBILITY STATE LEGISLATURE FOR NOT HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE THIS ISSUE WE'VE CERTAINLY- HELD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND WE'VE GONE OUT TO OUR UTILITIES AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN THAT AREA- WE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY IS A STATE IN THAT AREA SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION. YOU KNOW WHY DID WE ARE NOT FINISH THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR PUSH THE IN A FLOOD OF STRUCTURE AT LEAST. PUT IT ON PAR WITH RENEWABLES AND- TO THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OVER HERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THOSE THINGS- WHETHER SOME CROSSOVER SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE I'M GONNA BE PUSHING THE CPC AT ALL CERTAINLY. KEEP THE AMOUNTS OFFICE- NORTH FIVE A WE'RE DOING PERHAPS SOME WE CAN PARTNER TOGETHER ON WITH OTHER MEMBERS LEGISLATORS WILL. NOT JUST ADDED OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ARE- A OUR OFFICES HAVE BEEN HEARING A LOT FROM CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THIS- I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT TO ADDISON IS IN THE ROOM TODAY AND THEY'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS. BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT COME THE BEGINNING OF THE LETTER. GEN I IN JANUARY WE'LL SEE MORE DISCUSSIONS AND PERHAPS POLICY PROPOSALS- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO- AS A STATE OR LOCAL. THIS IS ON THE OF THIS IS UNCHARTERED TERRITORY. AND THE REASON THAT WE HAVE THE POWERSHOT UPS WAS WAS DONE TO PREVENT. MASSIVE FIRES I MEAN THAT DO THE REASON IS A GOOD REASON THAT WE WERE WHAT WE WERE DOING. ON THE IMPLEMENTATION IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE I THINK FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT ONE- AND I KNOW THAT TO OUR OUR GOVERNOR AND MANY LEGISLATORS. THE STATE. ARE ASKING OURSELVES THE HARD QUESTIONS. WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WHERE WE GONNA MAKE THE FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS WHERE IT'S- GOING TO COME. VISIT IN A LOCAL. COMMUNITY COMMUNITY- WHAT IT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH COUNTY AND COMMUNITIES AND WE GONNA LOOK THE SAME IN HIGH PROPOSED. HIGH PROPENSITY- PRONE FIRE AREAS AS IT WOULD IN OTHER AREAS AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES. ON THAT I. IMAGINE WILL BE PART OF AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STATE OF PASSION. TO YOUR SECOND POINT. ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH. THIS WE ACTUALLY- SUZANNE CAN BE PART OF THAT THE- PANEL. THE SECOND PANEL SO I'LL JUST. ALTHOUGH A LOT THEN I TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. FOLLOW UP OF IT TOO AND. ADD TO WHAT I ALREADY SAID IN THAT THE OPPOSITION TO A LOT OF US INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES WAS RIGHT ADVOCACY GROUPS RIGHT- WHEN YOU GO BACK LOOKED PROCEEDINGS AND ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK- TURN WHICH LOOKS AFTER- RATEPAYERS INTEREST AND I THINK THERE'S A LARGER ISSUE AND- ALL RAISE THIS AND THIS MAY NOT BE A POPULAR STATEMENT. IN THIS COMEDIAN THIS CROWD I REPRESENT CAN INLAND CALIFORNIA I'M SITTING ON COASTAL CALIFORNIA BUT- THE REALITY OR UTILITY RATES HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES FOR PEOPLE I REPRESENT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A HOT OR COLD CLIMATE RIGHT SO IS CALIFORNIA'S PURSUED YOUR REAL LETTER SHE AND ALL OF THE KIND OF WORTHWHILE GOALS THAT WE SAT IN MANY CASES AND SHE GREAT PROGRESS ON. THAT'S COME AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME OF THE POOREST PEOPLE IN THE STATE RIGHT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE A TWO THREE FOUR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR EACH ANY BILL- AND THEN YOU GO TO NANCY SCANNERS DISTRICT IN BERKELEY AND YOU HAVE A FAIRLY YOU KNOW WEALTHY PEOPLE WITH EIGHTY DOLLAR BILLS- SO IT'S NOT BEEN- WITH NOT FOUND A WAY TO CAN EQUALIZE OUR INVESTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE FOR A FINANCE PERSPECTIVE. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BECOME EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WE HAD DISCUSSIONS IN THE GEO CAN BE THIS PAST YEAR. WHEN THE AREAS MOST. AFFECTED BY THE WILD FIRES WERE LOOKING TO. FOR TO HELP THESE ERRORS BUT I THINK THE ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS IS THAT WE'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO PITCH IN TOGETHER IS A STATE. TOWARDS COMMON GOALS RECOGNIZE EACH OF OUR REGIONS HAS DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. AND TRY TO FIND- YOUR FAIR WAY TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE- THE RATE. ABBASI OPPOSITION THAT PROBABLY IS STOOD IN THE WAY OF NEEDED INVESTMENTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE SO SORRY FOR THE LONG ANSWER BUT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. YOUR FOLLOW UP. AT THIS POINT WHY DON'T WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL AND THEN WELL ACTUALLY IT WILL TAKE ONE MORE QUESTION HERE AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. GOOD MORNING I'M A SEVENTY RESIDENT OF SANTA BARBARA. AND THE ONE THREE THANK YOU TO YOU. OF COMING HERE. MY DAUGHTER MY SON IN LAW WERE ALMOST BURNED TO DEATH IN THE TO FIND. SOME WILL ACQUAINTED WITH THE SERVICES AND THE FALCONS WORK- ONE OF THE THINGS I HEARD ABOUT HOUSING. WITH ONE TO INTERVIEW YOU. LOSE A WHOLE HELL. FORTUNATE FOR THEM THEY WERE RENTED. BUT IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED THERE CAN NO LONGER LIVE UP THERE BECAUSE THERE'S TOO MANY REGULATIONS THEY BOUGHT THE HOME THIRTY YEARS AGO THE REGULATIONS WERE DIFFERENT. AND NOW THEY CAN'T GO BACK. FIVE HUNDRED OF. OUR FIVE HUNDRED GALLON WATER TANK AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE ROAD AND SO. IS THERE A WAY TO ALLOW PEOPLE OR GET SOME ASSISTANCE FOR THEM TO GO BACK- TO THAT AREA I KNOW SOME OF THAT AREA. IS UNINHABITABLE BECAUSE IS BURNED SO BADLY BUT- I THINK IF WE HAD THE REGULATIONS WHERE THEY MIGHT RECEIVE SOME. OUR SYSTEM OF THE COULD BACK IN THE BILL. OF THE ONE OF THANK YOU THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK IS LIKE TWENTY NINE CATS IN THE BACK. OF AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITHOUT THE RED CROSS BECAUSE WELL MY CHILDREN WERE IN THE ROOM WHERE I COULD GO TO THE LOCAL RED CROSS AND JUST SIT THERE. WITH SOMEONE AND THEY WOULD TALK TO ME AND ASSURE. ME OF SO WE DO NEED TO THE CUT. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE WAY YOU DO GET INFECTED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM REALLY GLAD THE RED CROSS IS THERE FOR YOU- THAT THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE TRAIN DO THERE YOU KNOW IT I KEEP USING THE TERM WHOLE COMMUNITY BUT IT DOES TAKE. A WHOLE COMMUNITY TO RECOVER FROM THIS DISASTER THESE TYPES OF DISASTERS AND THAT INCLUDES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO YOU KNOW FROM BREED REMOVAL TO SOME PAYMENTS TO PEOPLE TO REBUILDING CODES TO I MEAN. IT IS ALL DESIGNED TO HELP PUT PEOPLE IN A BETTER SPACE AND TO LET THEM RECOVER THE PROBLEM IS THAT NONE OF IT IS FAST- IN A REBUILDING PARADISE IS GONNA TAKE. AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS HOW LONG YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE HOME BURNS DOWN COMPLETELY. THE GROUND IS BASICALLY HAZARDOUS MATERIAL AND IT'S GOT TO BE DUG OUT THAT'S THE VERY FIRST STEP SO. THAT IS PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITHOUT AND AVAILABILITY OF HOMES TO RENT OR PURCHASE EVEN IF YOU GET A CHECK FROM YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF THAT STRUGGLE IS WHAT DO WE DO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN ANSWER I KNOW IT'S DEFINITELY BEING TALKED ABOUT. AT AT THE GOVERNMENT LEVEL- BUT- I BAG I DON'T THINK I HAVE AN ANSWER. IN EVERY DOESN'T EITHER LOOKING OUT. THAT I HAVE AN ANSWER. A ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE TRY TO THEM AS A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND- LIKE DENISE MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT A SHELTER TASK FORCE WE ALSO HAVE A HOUSING TASK FORCE BECAUSE THIS IS A MASSIVE ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE WHEN YOUR HOUSE BURNS DOWN. AND IT'S YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S ALL THESE NEW REGULATIONS AND NEW RULES THAT ARE COMMON TO PLACE WE CAN'T AUTOMATICALLY WAIVE THOSE BECAUSE WHAT ABOUT THE PERSON THAT BOUGHT THAT BUILT THEIR HOUSE THE DAY BEFORE THE DISASTER AND THEY DIDN'T BURN THAT'S NOT REALLY FAIR ALL THAT. ALL THAT FUN STUFF AND SO WHAT THEY TRY TO DO IS INDIVIDUALLY HELP AND WALK THROUGH AND THEY WORK VERY CLOSELY OF THE HOUSING TASK FORCE IS MADE UP OF NOT ONLY STATE FOLKS BUT ALSO THE BULK OF IT BEING LOCAL AUTHORITIES. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN ASSIST AND HELP WITH THAT AND SO THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IT IS A HUGE. HUGE G. DAY TO CAL UP IN THAT CROSS THE BOARD RURAL COASTAL YOU NAME IT. HOUSING IS AN ISSUE AND SO I THERE'S A- FORCE THAT IS WORKING ON THAT AS WE SPEAK. I'M GONNA JUMP IN AND TAKE THE BOAT SIR FOR OUR PANEL ON THAT HOUSING- I DON'T DRIFT OFF TOO FAR INTO HOUSING IN THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY- BUT CERTAINLY DO JUST A PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE BEFORE YOUR NEXT PANEL. YEAH WE'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND HOMES PER YEAR STATEWIDE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO BUILD THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES STATEWIDE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS A THREE MILLION HOME SHORTFALL. IN SUPPLY. AND I JUST IF YOU'RE POSITIVE THINK OF THAT IF WE'RE GONNA GO FROM BUILDING HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES TO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES THAT MEANS WE NEED FOUR TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE TO WORK ON BUILDING HOMES AND WE'VE DONE A FAIRLY INEFFECTIVE JOB IN LAST THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS IN CALIFORNIA OF TRAINING YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO THOSE TYPES OF JOBS TO BE PLUMBERS CARPENTERS WRITERS SO. ON THE UPSIDE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT TO HAVE A WHOLE GENERATION OF PEOPLE HAVE GOOD PAYING JOBS- ON THE DOWNSIDE WE DON'T HAVE AN EDUCATION SYSTEM PLACE THIS PREPARING STUDENTS TO DO THOSE THINGS. SO IT IS A IT IS A- ALMOST- UNTHINKABLE SOLUTION ARE IMMEASURABLE- PROBLEM. FOR CALIFORNIA ADDRESS WE DO HAVE A GOVERNMENTS COMMIT DRESS YET I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES- WANT TO ADDRESS IT IT'S A REQUIRE ALL OF US TO GET OVER A LOT OF THINGS JUST LIKE OUR PREVIOUS POINT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THEM THESE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO. GET OVER THEMSELVES THE COSTA COMMITTEES ARE GONNA HAVE TO BUILD HOUSES WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF. PEOPLE I'M HAPPY BUT IF WE ALL PITCH IN TOGETHER STATEWIDE I THINK WE CAN. WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS SO WE CAN ACTUALLY- HAVE SOME ECONOMIC BENEFIT FOR A NOT A WHOLE GENERATION. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL BECAUSE WE'RE DRIFTING FAR OFF OF OUR SUBJECT. LET'S LOOK LET'S GIVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THIS PANEL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY SO WELCOME OUR NEW PANEL LET ME WILL GET STARTED MOMENTARILY. AND WHILE WE WELCOME THE NEW PANEL I JUST WANNA RECOGNIZE WE DO HAVE SANTA BARBARA MAYOR CATHY MARIE- HERE SUPERVISOR GREG HART IS HERE AND WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM CONGRESS MEMBER CARVAJAL'S OFFICE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JACQUI AT. I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRISTY SMITH'S OFFICE SENATOR JACKSON'S OFFICE A SUPERVISOR APARTMENT IN WILLIAMS AND- SANTA BARBARA FIGHT REPRESENTATIVES ARE HERE WHEN THE SIMS MO AND JACKIE READ.

THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY AND- GIVEN US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR SUCCESSFUL PARTNERSHIPS HERE LOCALLY WITH SOME OF OUR NON PROFITS. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE- THE PREVIOUS PANELS- TERMINOLOGY AS THEY WENT THROUGH THEIR VARIOUS. VISITATIONS ESPECIALLY THE WORDS WHOLE COMMUNITY BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE KNOW HERE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR X. SIX HERE- AS FACE- ON PRESIDENT DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES. SO I THINK I'M GONNA KINDA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT IT'S- HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN WORKING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT- AND THEN CUT UP. FOCUS MY TIME ON THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE COUNTY. BARBARA PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENT COMMUNITIES I SEE A LOT OF FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES OUT IN THAT AUDIENCE HERE TODAY THAT WE HAVE SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH AND I COULD TALK FOR DAYS ON WHAT WE ALL THAT- WENT THROUGH AND SOME OF THE STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND- GREAT THINGS THAT WE FOUND. WE PUT TOGETHER AT AND- AND WERE SUCCESSFUL OUT HERE LOCALLY BUT I'M GONNA STICK TODAY WITH THE PARTNERSHIP RESIGNED COMMUNITIES. I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS AS WE MOVE THROUGH. I'M PLANNING FOR THE NEXT DISASTER AS WERE STILL RECOVERING FROM THE THOMAS FIRE AND ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW IS THAT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY. KNOWS THAT THEY HAVE A ROLE- WITH US IN HELPING COVER AND THAT MEANS BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS CHURCHES NONPROFIT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. IN EVERYONE OF THEIR ROLES ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS THERE'S A LITTLE WILL ROOM THERE THERE'S ROOM TO HELP THERE'S ROOMS TO FIND WAYS TO SAY YET THERE'S ROOM. TO PARTNER TOGETHER. AND THERE'S ALSO A FEELING OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL OF US THEY'RE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER. AND I KNOW THAT FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S WHY THE PARTNERSHIP RESILIENT COMMUNITIES CAME TOGETHER. UNITED AND PARTNERED WITH US. THE THOMAS FIRE NO ONE NINE DEBRIS FLOW. WE EXPERIENCED HERE IT WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION CHOIR A LOT OF COORDINATION WITH OUR NONPROFIT SECTOR. THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE TYPICALLY THOUGHT OF AS THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE ESPECIALLY RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES. TO TELL YOU TODAY. ISN'T THE ONLY PARTNER THAT'S REALLY NEEDED WHEN A FULL SCALE EVENT HAPPENS. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERYONE IN OUR WHOLE COMMUNITY. ALSO DOES NOT FAMILIAR NAVIGATING PROJECTS THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACIES. SOMETIMES IT CAN BE A HUGE CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP. AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNMENT ARE YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF OUR GOVERNMENTS ARE PEOPLE AND THEIR PEOPLE WORKING HARD. AND FOLLOWING MANY PEOPLE BEFORE THEM. IN SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND- THAT IN IN OUR OPERATION AND GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WERE OFTEN TAUGHT. THAT BY THE TIME YOU ENTER YOUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR WORK IS ALIGNED WITH YOUR MISSION AND MAKE SURE THAT- THAT YOU CARRY OUT YOUR MISSION AND A FAIR AND ETHICAL WAY. AND THE EASY BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES A LOT OF REGULATIONS AND SOMETIMES WHEN WE HAVE AN EMERGENCY IT'S HARD TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND RECOGNIZE. THAT WE NEED ASSISTANCE. SO ONE OF THE KEY FUNDAMENTAL THINGS IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ALIGNMENT. OF A NON PROFIT- WITH ONE OF OUR MISSIONS AND IN OUR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. AND I THINK THAT EVERY TIME YOU USE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY APPROACH YOU'RE GONNA FIND ALIGNMENT WITH WHATEVER THE MISSION OF THAT NONPROFIT OR VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION IS. AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. DEBT EMERGENCIES GIVE US A CHANCE TO TEST NEW PARTNERSHIPS A CHANCE FOR US ALL TO THINK DIFFERENTLY AND A PROBLEM SOLVED DIFFERENTLY. AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY PIECES OF THAT IS FOR US ON THE GOVERNMENT SIDE TO LISTEN. MEANS LISTENING. TO CRITICISMS SOMETIMES MAYBE THEY'LL COME IN COMMITTEE MEETINGS OR THROUGH ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT THOSE CRITICISMS ARE REALLY WHERE YOU'RE GAPS ARE. AND A AND THEIR OPPORTUNITIES FOR. US TO WORK HARDER AND WORK DIFFERENTLY TO LEVERAGE OUR NONPROFIT RELATIONSHIPS. TO HELP FILL THOSE GAPS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND I KNOW THAT. DISASTERS START AND END LOCALLY. AND IT REALLY IS US. WE HAVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HELPING TO BACK US TO GET US THOSE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND THE RESOURCES WE NEED WHEN IT AND EMERGENCY EXCEEDS OUR ABILITY. TO RESPOND HERE LOCAL. BUT IT'S REALLY US IN A COMMUNITY THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE LONG AFTER DISASTER TO PULL THINGS TOGETHER. SO. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE HAVE TO DO EVEN BEFORE THE DISASTER IS WORK TOGETHER AND TO COMMUNICATE TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN A DISASTER STRIKES ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO BE PREPARED TO DO IS ASK OURSELVES WHO HAS THAT EXPERTISE IN THIS TYPE OF DISASTER VISIT US LOCALLY IS THIS SOMETHING WE REGULARLY HAVE LIKE A WILDFIRE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THAT'S WHAT ONE NINE PRESENTED US. WITH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAT WE NEEDED SOME SPECIALIZED HELP FOR AND THAT'S WHERE THE PARTNERSHIP A RESILIENT COMMUNITIES CAME TOGETHER AND ASKED THE COUNTY WHAT DO YOU NEED WOULD BE HELPFUL TO GET SOMEONE THERE COULD BE A PROJECT EXPERT FOR YOU THE COULD COME TOGETHER AND UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES OF WORKING THROUGH- THE RECOVERY. AND THE REBUILDING OF MODESTY TO. AND I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GROUP BE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE ALIGNMENT OF INDIVIDUAL GROUPS. AND HOW. HOW THAT HAPPENS- WE KNOW IN EMERGENCY SOME GROUPS POP UP ORGANICALLY- SOME. ARE MORE STRATEGIC AND I'VE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND SERVE MANY COMMUNITIES. SOME OF THEM COME TOGETHER AND MODIFY THEIR SCOPES AND BECOME A BIGGER FORCE FORCE. AND OTHERS- CONTINUE THE WORK THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE WERE. DOING ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS. AND I THINK THEY IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE TURNED TO A LOT OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND DEBRIS FLOWS AND WE TRIED TO LEARN AS MUCH AS WE COULD AND WE WERE THE ONLY ONES DOING THAT THE PARTNERSHIP REZAEI COMMUNITIES ALSO WAS OUT THERE HIRING SCIENTISTS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT COULD HAPPEN AS WE CONTINUALLY LIVED UNDER ADDITIONAL RISK. WITH STORMS IN THE FORECAST. AND THEY DONATED- PROJECT EXPERT TO HELP US WORK THROUGH SOME OF THAT CHOREOGRAPHING THE RESTORING THE WATER POWER GAS THE ROADS THE BRIDGES THAT WERE OUT. WHILE YOU'RE MOVING DUMP TRUCKS FULL OF MUD AND DEBRIS OUT OF THE COMMUNITY. SO THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT AND THEN THEY ASK THEMSELVES WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO WHAT ELSE CAN WE HELP WITH. MET WITH A LOT OF VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF INSTALLING THE NETS AND WANNA LET PAT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NETS AND WHAT THEIR- GROUP REALLY WAS TASKED WITH. BUT I THINK THAT. IN ORDER TO WRAP UP. IT LEE IS THIS MATCH MAKER THAT ABIGAIL BROUGHT UP EARLIER FUNCTION. THAT WILL GET YOU. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT TOOK INDIVIDUALS FROM OUR FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT. FROM OUR LEGAL TEAM. FROM OUR POLICY MAKERS ARE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. OUR DEPARTMENT THAT ACTED AS REGULATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR OUR METAL INTERESTS WERE PROTECTED. DURING THESE. AND A LOT OF. FOLKS THE PARDON THERE TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE WERE SIX UP. SO I THINK THAT AS AS- I WRAP UP AND TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PARTNERSHIP. IT REALLY IS THEN THE- THE ABILITY TO BE FLEXIBLE THE ABILITY PATIENT. AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK HARD. WITH WITH EACH OTHER. FOR THE OVERALL GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATT THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY HI MY NAME IS PAT MCELROY- I WAS A FIRST RESPONDER FOR THIRTY SEVEN YEARS IS COUNTY. AND WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WAS MANAGING THE THOMAS FIRE AND THE DEBRIS FLOW. AND SO- UPON MY RETIREMENT I STARTED WORKING WITH A GROUP THAT WAS FORMED AFTER THE DEBRIS FLOW NUMBER GO THROUGH SOME QUICK SLIDES BUT NOTHING NOTHING. I PROMISED TO TOO LONG. I BELIEVE IN THE CLIMATE CHANGES HAPPENING. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH IT IN THE OLD LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN THE FIRE WORLD. AND WHAT I'M WHAT I'M- REALIZING THAT IS THAT IT'S NOT ONLY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE A BIT MEANS IT. WORK VISAS WERE HAVING ARE NOT ONLY GETTING BIGGER THEY'RE BECOMING MORE FREQUENT. AND THE RESULTS AFTERWARDS ARE ARE BECOMING MORE OBVIOUS TO US SO. WHEN I LOOK AT THESE DISASTERS NOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT I THINK ABOUT IS WHAT WE'VE DONE BEFORE STILL GOING TO BE A FACTOR BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK THE PROBLEM DIFFERENTLY AND I THINK WE LOOK AT THE PROBLEM- DIFFERENTLY. BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE WE'RE. FIGHTING FIRES- I WOULD FROM THOMAS FIRED MENDOCINO COMPLEX AFTER RETIRED FOR HELP WITH AN INVESTIGATION AND I'M GONNA TYPE ONE TEAM AND WE TOOK OVER FROM TO TYPE ON TEAMS THAT HAD FOR THREE WEEKS WE HAD IT FOR TWO WEEKS AND TURN IT OVER TO SOMEBODY ELSE. SO THAT'S ONLY SIX OR SEVEN WE. THAT'S JUST ON PRESIDENT HAS TO OUR THOUSAND ACRES BURNED IN THE THOMAS FIRE BY THE WAY. RIGHT OUT BACK TO THE DEBRIS FLOW PROJECT WE WERE A GROUP OF PEOPLE FORM RIGHT AFTER THE- THE INCIDENT. AND IT. THE FIRST MET IN THE- DINING CAR TOSSED THEY WERE BEING. AND WE. THEY CAME TO ME EVERYONE SOMETHING AND THEN THE PEOPLE WITH THE KIND OF THE NEW SERVER. WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS. WE HELP WE KNEW THAT AND WITH THE RESPONDING AGES TWENTY FLOOD CONTROL FIRST BOND. THEY HAVE NO ABILITY TO ADD TO THEIR TAX. SO WE ARE LOOKING AREA. HE WAS WORKING AND WE- MORE. YOU'RE GREAT. OKAY WHAT GROUPS LIKE THAT OR WHAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT SO WE WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ON IS THE AREA ABOVE. BASICALLY MOUNTAIN DRIVE WHERE THE DEBRIS FLOWS CAME FROM AND WE WOULD WE KEPT IT LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF SITES LIKE THIS IS PART ONE POINT OF THIS. CANYON AND THIS IS TWO HUNDRED ALL OF MIL ROUTE WHO KNOWS THAT THE CHARACTER OF THE DEBRIS IT IS A- CLOSE. WHAT. ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND IN THAT YEAH IN SWITZERLAND AND JAPAN WE FOUND SOME TO DARGIE WE STARTED A RAISING SOME MONEY WE WERE VERY LUCKY EARLY ON HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE GIVE US SOME SIZEABLE DONATION JUST TO GO OUT FIND WHAT THERE IS OUT THERE. AND SO MATT SAID WE WENT TO THE COUNTY COULD. AFTER SPENDING MY CAREER IN GOVERNMENT. THE LAST THING I WANT IS SOME CITIZENS ARE GOVERNMENT FOR COMING UP AND TELLING ME HOW TO DO MY JOB. SO WE ASKED THEM WHERE COULD WHERE CAN WE HELP WHERE DO YOU NEED HELP. WOULD IT HELP YOU IF WE WERE LOOKING UP FOR THESE CANYONS DURING. MAPPING THE DURING SEVENTY FIVE- GEO MAPPING AND THEY SAID YES SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID. IN THIS TEAM STARTED. SMALLER GROUP IN THE WINTER. AS WE MOVED HERE THERE'S SOME NEWS PART THAT'S CELEBRATE OUR- FIRE OUR GROUP. BRING WITH THE COUNTY. AWESOME. WE WERE VERY CLEAR TURN WE WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE AND CORRECT AND I KIND OF WANT BUT HOW WOULD DEAL WITH OTHER AGENTS WE WANTED. WITH RESPECT TO LIVE IN THIS AREA. OUR CONCERNS IMPACT ON TRAIL. AND WE CON. THREE IT IS ALSO WITH. THE BRIEF WELL AND LOOKING YES I WAS. WHAT WE WANT TO DO. OTHER WEEK. CAN STOP A REPORT WE BREAK. WE STOPPED LARGE MATURE. A LOT WAS A SETTLEMENT WATER TO CONTINUE THROUGH DO IT SO IT'S TIED UP ABOVE THE CREEK SO THAT DOESN'T IMPEDE THE ANIMAL OR FISH PASSAGE THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE ENGAGED LARGE GROUPS OF THE COMMUNITY DIFFERENT- INTEREST GROUPS ON WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY NEEDED TO SEE FROM AS WE MADE CHANGES CONTRAILS RATE. CHANGES BASED ON HABITAT. WE HAD TO GO THROUGH WHAT WE WANT. SO ALL THESE THERE. WHICH ARE NOT BEING MODIFIED- COUNTY STARTING IN TWENTY STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY SO GIVE PROTECTION WHILE IT ADDS A PROTECTION WHILE THOSE TO BE BASES ARE BEING MODIFIED THESE WITH IT. THESE ARE THE AREAS THE ANNUAL WE WENT OUT FOR PERMITS. COLD SPRINGS. ROLL UP PRIVATE. AND SO FOUNDER THREE AND ORDERS A WITH THEM SURE. WE GOT THERE MISSION WORK ON. IF YOU REMEMBER CANYON HOT SPRINGS ON FEDERAL LAND WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT THE DAY WE GOT OUR PERMITS FOR THESE OTHER THINGS WAS THE DAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LAST DECEMBER.

ASKED TO NAME A FINISHING ACOSTA QUESTIONS WITHIN THE NEXT- TWENTY DAYS SO THAT WILL BE DONE FOR THE WINTER. BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD WE NOT HAD. TO POUR OUT OF OUR COUNTY. AND. THE WEAK COMPS I'D LISTEN WHEN. VIA MAIL COMMUNITY OUR ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CALIFORNIA READER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD ALL OF WHOM WE NEEDED TO GET A PERMIT FROM THE WHICH WE TOOK EVERYTHING SERIOUSLY AND SATISFY THEIR CONDITIONS AND- THESE ARE TEMPORARY INSTALLATIONS THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL PART- PROTECTION UNTIL THE- THIRD THE GROUND THE GROUNDWORK COVERS TO LEAVE GROWTH OCCURS AND THE CONDITION STABILIZE SO THIS ISN'T A PERMANENT SOLUTION IT'S THIS IS A- SOMETHING TO BUY IS THE TIME. UNTIL. THE REWROTE THE CURVES AND NOT RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE ACTIVATION MAPS ARE BEING WITHDRAWN. AND THEY ARE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THAT THEIR PRODUCTION FOR THE SEASON LOOKING AT THE RECALL BOTH LOOKING AT THE USGS REPORTS AND A NEW FACTOR THERE CONSIDERING DECIDING WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THE RED ZONE AND ARE NOT.

ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO WAS ALSO CALIFORNIA HOPE IT'LL TO. V. MY ROLE IN THE WANT TO SEE THOSE CENTER I THINK. THE BETWEEN. JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS IT SERVED AS THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR THE MOST AFFECTED AND MULTIPLE WONDERFUL POPULATION- WE HAD WRAPS THAT WE HAD REVISOR WILLIAMS THERE WE HAD- BRIGADE HAD OUR WHOLE TEAM WHICH WAS- SIX CRISIS. COUNSELORS HAVE THEM WHERE. WE HAD WE'VE THERE WAS ECONOMIC VENTURES. WE HAD- EIGHT OH FIVE CONSERVATION OF. MOST OF THE VERY. THEY'RE BUILT THAT WERE LOST IN THE DEBRIS FLOW. WE ALSO HAVE OKAY OKAY.

IT REALLY IT REALLY. AND IT REALLY MADE ME REALIZE THAT PART. TRANSITION INTO MY ROLE WITH CALIFORNIA- CALIFORNIA HOPE DID REALLY A LOT OF OUR REGION A LOT OF EDUCATION A LOT OF. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TO KIND OF GIVING PEOPLE TOOLS OF FOR COPING SKILLS GOING TO THE POLLS I MEAN EVEN BEING BROWN BLOCKING ON DOORS JUST CHECK IN ON PEOPLE AND REALLY MAKING SURE. ONE WAS OKAY AND THE ASSURING THEM THAT THEY WERE STILL HELP OUT. WE SERVE. XIN TO BRIDGE THE GAP WITH. AB A RECENT THAT PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BEEN AWARE OF. ANYWHERE FROM HELPING THEM APPLY TO GROUND TO DIRECT RELIEF AROUND THE UNITED WAY GRANTS ALL THAT. ALL THAT THE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AWARE OF. ALSO A LOT OF OUT REACH AGAIN- WAS DONE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY- WITH THE HELP OF A LOT OF TRUSTED PARTNER IN THE COMMUNITY. A LOT OF US ARE KNOWN- ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- A LOT OF SPANISH OUT REACH WE HAD A REALLY GOOD- COMMUNITY MEETING ACCESS OR NOT I THOUGHT THEY HAD A TREMENDOUS- ATTENDANCE IT WAS AMAZING AND WE WERE ABLE TO RIGHT THEN AND THERE- REGISTER PEOPLE FOR A WHERE. PREPARE FOR NEXT SOUL OR JUST KIND OF. GIVING THEM THOSE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE THEIR FAMILIES IN CASE OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD COME UP- KIND OF. REALLY EDUCATING AND- LETTING THEM KNOW THAT WE ARE HERE TO HELP WE WERE ABLE TO REALLY ASSIST AND- GETTING THEM PREPARED AND THAT THEY'RE STILL RESOURCES OUT THERE IF THEY'RE LACKING ANY. SO. THIS COLLABORATION BETWEEN NONPROFIT GOVERNMENT IS I THINK IT. YEAH. SO HOW IS EVERYONE DOING GETTING HUNGRY AND. DON'T WORRY THE FOOD BANK IS HERE- SO MY NAME IS DEREK TALKING ON THE SEA OF THE FOOD BANK SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- GRAIN FOR INVITING US HERE SO HOW WE KEEP PEOPLE FED THE EVENT OF A MAJOR DISASTER. I'M JUST GONNA BRIEFLY EXPLAIN WHAT THE FOOD BANK DOESN'T A DAILY BASIS AND THEN HOW WE IF IT THAT DURING A DISASTER SITUATION SO WE OPERATE EVERY DAY BASICALLY SOURCING STORING AND DISTRIBUTING FOOD AROUND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. WE DISTRIBUTE TEN MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD PER YEAR THREE THREE HUNDRED MEMBER AGENCY ORGANIZATIONS SO A LOT OF YOUR FAVORITE ORGANIZATIONS THEY COME TO THE FEEDBACK THEY GET THEIR FOOD- AND HALF OF WHAT WE DISTRIBUTE FRESH PRODUCE- SO WE ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING FOOD TO REALLY AN INCREDIBLE ONE IN FOUR PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTY. SO IT MIGHT BE IN VERY SMALL WAYS IN TERMS OF SOME FOOD FOR SOME FRUIT FOR HEAD START PROGRAM RIGHT THROUGH TO SENIORS WHO WE MIGHT BE PROVIDE LONG TERM SUPPORT TO- AND TYPICALLY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING WITH ARE THE WORKING POOR WE'RE GETTING NEAR THE END OF THAT AND THEIR PAY PERIOD AND YOU KNOW ARE REALLY STRUGGLING IN OUR FOOD IN SECURE. THAT'S A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US- WE ALSO RUN A NATIONAL AWARD WINNING FOOD LITERACY PROGRAMS THAT HELP ARMS KIDS STARTING AT PRESCHOOL LEVEL RIGHT UP TO YOU HIGH SCHOOL ABOUT HOW TO BE HEALTHY WITH FOOD AND WATER THE PRACTICAL SKILLS INVOLVED. SO THAT'S HOW WE DEAL WITH WHAT IS THE DAILY DISASTER OF ANGER BUT WHAT ABOUT WHEN THERE IS- AND THIS IS AN IMMEDIATE DISASTER THAT AFFECTS A HUGE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY. WE FEEL THAT OUR LOGISTICAL AND NETWORK STRIP THAT WE USE EVERY DAY ARE ACTUALLY VITAL ORGAN DURING THIS ACTOR- SO WHERE THE PRIMARY. USDA TO THAT WOULD COME IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING A DISASTER. AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPEATING. A LOT OF THE SCHOOLS WERE SHUT DOWN- AND THEN. TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING FREE AND REDUCED. CHEST SO THOSE KIDS WERE SUFFERING- AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO PUT ON- LUNCH MEALS FOR THOSE PEOPLE. I'M AND THEN WHEN MANY OF OUR MEMBER AGENCIES WERE NOT ABLE TO OPERATE DURING THE FIRE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SEND AND THEIR STAFF OUT INTO THE YOU KNOW DANGEROUS AIR QUALITY CONDITIONS. WE HAD TO SET UP NEW DISTRIBUTIONS THAT TAKE AWAY TYPICALLY TOOK PLACE INDOORS BECAUSE OF THESE CALIFORNIA ALL THE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE OUTSIDE BEFORE- AND THAT ENABLED US TO MAKE USE OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED- NEIGHBORHOOD OF VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE. THEY SAY THAT IN A DISASTER A BY THE SECOND DAY YOUR PLAN DISASTER PLAN THE ONE THAT YOU SPENT ABOUT DOLLARS. COMING UP WITH A ITS KIND OF IN THE DUMPER- AND WATCHED HAVE TO RELY ON IS THE RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU DEVELOP OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS- AND THAT'S CERTAINLY BEEN THE YOU KNOW A BIG LESSON FOR US. SO OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE BEEN WORKING INTENSIVELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS- SUCH AS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THE RED CROSS AND SALVATION ARMY. TO PUT TOGETHER A DISASTER FEEDING PLAN FOR THE COUNTY- YOU KNOW THE COUNTY HAS A DISASTER PLAN BUT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE A FEEDING PLAN ELEMENT IN IT. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PLAN BRING TOGETHER ALL THE PARTNERS. THAT WILL ENABLE US TO OPERATE- DURING A DISASTER- WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER DISASTER FEEDING TASK FORCE THAT WILL MEET EVERY YEAR AND CHANGE THE PLAN AND TRAIN AROUND THE PLAN. SO HOPEFULLY. A PLAN THAT LAYS OUT LAST BEYOND DAY TO. DISASTER SO WHAT IS REALLY KEY FOR US IS OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE NETWORK SO I TALK ABOUT THREE HUNDRED LOCAL NONPROFIT AGENCIES. THOSE ARE REALLY AGENCIES AGO FROM LARGE TO TIENEN THEY'RE ALL OVER THE- THE DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AND ALSO A LOT OF AGENCIES WON'T BE ABLE TO RUN IN THE DISASTER SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RELY ON A WHOLE. CRAZY QUILT DIFFERENT AGENCIES. I WE ALSO RELY ON REGIONAL FOOD BANKS SO YOU KNOW DURING THE. THOMAS DISASTER WE COULDN'T GET FOOD. PRINTER. BECAUSE THE ONE A ONE SHUT DOWN. SO WITHIN ONE DAY THOSE PROGRAM. TO BE RESUPPLIED OUR SISTER FEEDBACK IN VENTURA. WE HAVE A THEIR FOOD BANKS IN SLOW COUNTY- IN BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO. SO FOOD CAN COME IN FOR LOCALLY VERY QUICK TO US. AND THEN ALSO WERE MEMBERS OF A NATIONAL NETWORK WHICH COLD FEET AMERICA. THE NET TWO HUNDRED. AND BASED IN TWENTY SEVEN BASS MILLIONS OF HOW WOULD. FROM THAT WERE MADE TO THE U. S. SO IT'S REALLY A VITAL SO AT THE FOOD BANK REALLY LEARN THOMAS AFTER WE HAVE A NEW DESIGN I'M ENGINEER STARTING THE WEEK. THANKS FOR TRAINING. AND ALSO WE'RE DEVELOPING A NEW CADRE OF DISASTER VOLUNTEERS WHO WILL HELP BILL TO MAINTAIN THESE NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRIBUTIONS- SO THEY NEVER REALLY LACKING AT THE MOMENT IS IN IMPROVE SOUTH COUNTY- OUR FACILITY SO IT'S OKAY TO ASK FOR HELP RIGHT THE DISASTER AND EVEN BEFORE DISASTER SO WE HAVE A SOUTH COUNTY FACILITY THAT'S VERY KINDLY- LEASED. BY THE COUNTY SANTA BARBARA I'M A BIT. OUR STATE. FOOD FROM OUR NORTH CANTON WAREHOUSE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET DOWN THE ONE A ONE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO FIND THE SITE TO DEVELOP AN EMERGENCY FOOD STORE FOR THE SOUTHERN OF PART OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL DAYS FOR FOOD BILL TO COME IN FROM AIR OR FROM C. SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE SOME FOOD ON HAND FOR MULTIPLE DAYS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP PEOPLE FED HERE. SO. I ASK- SO. YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US HERE TO TAKE PART. IT'S ALL OF OUR PANELISTS. START AT SHE THE CONVERSATION NO I'VE HAD THE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE OF WORKING WITH ALL. NOT JUST IN IN IN THE NATURAL DISASTER A RESPONSE MOMENTS BUT IN OTHER MOMENTS AND ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT TO US IT COMES TO MINE IS. HOW IT IS WHAT YOU. SCALE UP. THE OTHER COUNTY ARE THERE THE STATE. I'LL SURE FOR MY EXPERIENCE WOULD BE GREAT IF THE ROOM DOES TOO SO. OR NOT. MY BROTHER COUNTY. WORKS SHARE IT. AND THAT'S WHAT HELPS US ALL TO GET GOING SO SAVE FOR MY CELL MONO STATEWIDE OF. THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON A STATE WIDE WORKGROUP LOOKING AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISASTER RESPONSE. THE WORLD IS A SMALL WORKGROUP PUTTING TO OTHER A TOOL KIT FOR THE STATE AND THEN A TOOL KIT FOR COUNTIES THAT'S ONE AYE BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT IT'S A WAY OF SHARING EXPERIENCES HAVING A CHANCE TO REPLICATE- WE DO A LOT OF CONSULTATION ALSO WITH OTHER COUNTIES EVEN AS RECESS BI&amp;LT;C.CYAN&amp;GT;. COMING ACROSS THEIR ONE&amp;LT;/C&amp;GT; YEAR AND- AT. THE SURFACE WITHOUT SO WE DO A LOT OF TALKING WITH OTHER COUNTY THIS IS ALL. SO THAT SOME OF THE WAYS THAT WE DON'T. FOR A FOR THE FIRST RESPONDER POINT OF VIEW IT IS RECOGNIZED IT'S. RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. AND THAT'S IT WHAT WHAT WE DISCOVERED- ESPECIALLY THOMAS FUNDED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER EVERYBODY THAT RESPONDED- WE HAD TO GO TO A MENTAL HEALTH DEBRIEFING WHAT WILL THEY WANTED ACCESS OR NOT THEY HAD TO BE BRIEF. AND THAT BRAND NEW NEVER HAPPENED FOR THE WOULDN'T OF BEEN EVEN CONCEIVABLE THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO BUT THE FOR THE FIRST TIME UNITED STATES LAST. YEAR MORE FIREFIGHTERS DIED BY SUICIDE IN THE TRAUMA. AND SO IT YEAH IT'S RECOGNIZING THE TOLL THAT. THESE EXPERIENCES TAKE ON INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY AND I SCALING IT UP I THINK IT'S JUST RECOGNIZED A LOT OF IS JUST RECOGNIZING HOW WIDESPREAD THE PROBLEM IS AND- IN A BIG BIG THEY COUNTIES THAT- NGO BUT THINGS ARE THERE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES ARE THERE ARE GROWING. AT THE END GROWING IN RECOGNITION OF THE PROBLEM. SO REMEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW HOW WE WOULD SAY THAT- THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES HERE LOCALLY TO MEET A MARATHON OF A RECOVERY PERIOD. HE HAD LEAN HEAVILY ON OUR PARTNERS FROM THE OTHER COUNTY IS THE CITIES IN JURISDICTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS. WE SHARE RESOURCES REALLY WELL HERE AND IN. WITH THE CITY AND- ANY OTHER SPECIAL DISTRICTS WE SHARE RESOURCES WE SHARE- WEEK WE GO UP AND DOWN THE STATE WE TALK ABOUT OUR EXPERIENCES HERE AND DO A LITTLE BIT OF LESSONS LEARNED WITH OTHER. WITH OTHER EXECUTIVES- AND ALSO LOCAL LOCALLY. WE HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OTHER RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE COUNTY SO THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THE SAN LUIS RECURRENT VENTURA HAS. AND ANOTHER ONE WAS DE CONFLICTING- AREAS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS AND YOU KNOW THE THOMAS FIRE STARTED VENTURA COUNTY AS- WELL AS IN. THE USE OF DIFFERENT MATIX SOME DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY AS WE- IT'S WORKING ON THOSE KIND OF THINGS YOU KNOW BEFORE THE EVENT BEFORE THE EMERGENCY TO MAKE SURE. FIRST TO TYPE FAMILY HERE ON. POST YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES LIVE INVENTOR A LOT OF- PEOPLE CAN YOU SOUTH OF PEOPLE COMMUTE NORTH TO BE YOURSELF. WE ARE ALL RELIED ON EACH OTHER AND THE MORE WE CAN SHARE RESOURCES AND OUR EXPERIENCES THAT ARE OFFERED IN THE. I'M A DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT QUESTION AND MAYBE PUSH BACK AND CHALLENGE YOU GUYS BUT. THE TWO COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE MOST NONPROFITS PER CAPITA IN THE STATE ARE SANTA BARBARA. NOW SOME OF YOU MAY THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF SOCIETY SOCIAL ILLS EXIST IN MARIN COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. YEAH I SAY THAT JUST OBVIOUSLY BUT- BUT BUT BUT IT DOES IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION THAT I SHALL NEVER LEMOND BROUGHT UP WHICH IS HOW DO WE TAKE YOU KNOW WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE IS A CONCENTRATION OF. WEALTH GENEROSITY NON PROFITS- EXPERIENCE AND HOW DO WE TAKE THAT AND APPLY THE LESSONS LEARNED. TO COUNTIES YOUR STATEWIDE THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES RIGHT. I THINK THERE'S YOUR THAT'S REALLY THE BEST TAKE AWAY FROM TODAY I'M EXCITED TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN FOLLOW UP VIA SAMAT IT'S MUCH INSTALLATION WORKING WITH SOME OF THE PANELISTS IN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS TO TAKE SOME OF THIS AND- BECAUSE IT IS CONCERNING THAT. I COUNTY WHERE THERE'S ENORMOUS PHILANTHROPIC WHERE THERE'S ENORMOUS. YELLOW EXPERTISE- AN ENORMOUS- WEALTH AND FEDERAL BUT WE STILL STRUGGLE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THESE HORRIFIC INCIDENTS RIGHT. AND SO WHAT WE DO YEAH- YOU'LL A MERCED COUNTY OR A. YOUR KERN COUNTY KINGS COUNTY. PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT THAT THAT THAT SAME SUPPORT STOP. I'M KIND OF CURIOUS ON THE SCALING I'D LIKE TO THINK ABOUT SCALING NOT IS WORKING WITH OTHER PARTNERS AS MUCH AS- WE ARE. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE LEAST AMONG US WHEN IT COMES TO THE LEASE RESOURCE COUNTIES WITH THE LEAST NUMBER. I'LL JUMP IN WITH I MEAN I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO REMEMBER THAT- YEAH IF WE TALK ABOUT THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE- SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THERE'S ANY THREE COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA HAVE MORE FOOD INSECURITY THAN HERE. ONE FOR CHILDREN THAT IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY IS LIVING IN POVERTY- SO THERE'S A KIND OF STARK FIGURES THAT ARE UNDERNEATH THE- THE WEALTH AND EVERYTHING THAT'S BUT I AGREE THE IN TERMS OF SERVICES SO IT IS DOWN TO US I MEAN WE AS AN ORGANIZATION. SHARE WITH ALL OUR PART TO BANKS. CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE NATION TERMS OF SHARING WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN OUR SKILLS- BUT THEN ALSO LOOKING AT HOW NATIONALLY WE CAN RE DIRECT- FOOD. DONATIONS TO AREA THAT MOST NEED IT SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN DISCUSSING. LOCALLY WOULD FREAK OUT IF WE TOOK OUR FOOD AND GAVE IT TO ANOTHER- COUNTY OR STATE PEOPLE VERY PROPRIETARY ABOUT HUNGER. AND IT BEING A LOCAL SOLUTION BUT WE FEEL THAT AT A NATIONAL LEVEL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE. I THINK FOR. BY GOING BACK TO THE FIRE MODEL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRULY GOING TO BE AS A COMMAND SYSTEM FOR US AND ONE OF THAT. AND THAT'S OUR MUTUAL AID GETS THROUGH THIS WHOLE STATE AND THE WHOLE. GOAL WESTERN UNITED STATES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE FIRE SCOPE WHICH IS THE GOVERNING. ORGANIZATION FOR THAT STARTED A MENTAL HEALTH PHONE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND WE HAVE LOCAL. LOCAL LEADERS ON THAT COMMITTEE- VETERAN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY NOW BUT THEY PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH EVERY AREAS IT'S GOVERNED BY IT'S A COMMAND SYSTEM AND FIRE SCOPE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW SO THERE IS A MUTUAL AID. CAPACITY NOW THAT COULD BE MONICA YOU I THINK COULD BE USED AS A MODEL FOR AGENCIES LIKE TO VAN THAT THE TO START NETWORKING. THE SAME WAY THAT YOU BUILD MUTUAL AID FOR WHAT. YOU'RE BUILDING. DIFFERENT TYPE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE HOW WHICH IS BEING RECOGNIZED AS MENTAL HEALTH. AS A MENTAL HEALTH AFTER EFFECTS OF TRAUMA BY DUE TO INCIDENTS. I AGREE MUCH. I THINK WE'RE INCREDIBLY BLESSED TO HAVE THE RESOURCES WE DO IN THIS COUNTY AND I DO RECOGNIZE NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE THAT BUT I CAN SAY I AM CERTAIN THAT ALL THOSE RESOURCES ALL THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT NEEDED AND MY CASE WITH BEHAVIORAL WELLNESS RESPONSE BABY RALPH RESPONSE AND THE REASON WHY IT'S A CULTURE CHANGE JUST LIKE YOU HAD DESCRIBED THE MENTAL HEALTH DEBRIEFINGS THAT OCCUR WITH FIRST RESPONDERS. MANY TIMES A COMMUNITY THEY MAY NOT FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THEREFORE NEED TO REQUEST FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT'S NOT TRUE IT'S TRAINING I HEARD THAT MENTAL HEALTH FOR TOSSED OUT IS A TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL FIRST AID WHICH IS UNIQUELY THAT TRAINING FOR PER DISASTER RESPONSE. ANYBODY CAN BE AND ON THAT. I'VE. HERE IN OUR COUNTY WHO. EXPERIENCED A SUICIDES WE HAD ONE SCHOOL THAT HAD THE SUICIDE OF FIVE SENIORS AND ONE WILL NOT SUICIDES ONE WITH THE DEATH OF THE DEBRIS FLOW BUT LOST FIVE SENIORS AND ONE YEAR. THAT SCHOOL WAS WELL EQUIPPED FOR THAT THE REASON THEY WORDS WE HAD RESPONDED IN THE PAST. AND WE HAD WORKED TOGETHER AND SETTING UP SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN THINGS CAME AND HIT I KNOW HOW TO RESPOND WITH THEIR INTERNAL CAPACITIES. SO THERE'S WAYS TO SET THAT UP IN ANY COMMUNITY NO MATTER THE SIZE IT'S GIVING. PEOPLE NEED IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE LICENSED THERAPIST THAT'S NOT REQUIRED FOR MIDDLE HOLD US TO RESPONSE. SO SOMEONE EMIGRATE APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT. LEATHER IS BACK TO. EDUCATION WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH HOW TO LEVERAGE THESE KIND OF THINGS LIKE TODAY'S HEARING WAS MEANT TO DO BUT IT REALLY IS THAT- SOME OF THOSE MODELS EXIST IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE RURAL COUNTIES UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- ACROSS OUR CENTRAL VALLEY THERE ARE A LOT OF GROUPS THERE ARE OF A LOT THERE ARE A LOT OF UNITING OF DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THOSE COUNTIES THEY DO COME TOGETHER MONTHLY QUARTERLY AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEPARTMENTS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF INITIATIVES. I THINK LEVERAGES SOME OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL HELP START BUILD LÀ MORE AND WITH AND THOSE SAME THINGS THOSE SAME PRINCIPLES APPLY TO THE NONPROFIT TO THE OTHER AGENCIES YOU KNOW- A LOT OF THE AGENCIES HERE TODAY AND WE WORK WITH REGULARLY ARE NOT JUST SPECIFIC TO ONE COUNTY THERE AS YOU KNOW ACROSS THE COUNTY ACROSS THE REGION ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I THINK THAT- THEY DON'T LOOK CARRIES AS GEOGRAPHIC TO DEVISE A LOOK AT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OFFER HELP WILL THEY CAN AND I REALLY DO THINK THAT. THAT THOSE. THOSE COLLABORATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WHERE THERE'S- A THERE'S A NEED AND I'VE I'VE SEEN SOME OF THEM WHEN IT COMES TO WATER AND WATER CONSERVATION BETWEEN SEVERAL RURAL COUNTIES OR- IN- PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE. WHERE THEY NEED TO RELY ON EACH OTHER'S TOWERS TO. BOOST THOSE MICROWAVE. SIGNALS ON THE PUBLIC RADIO- SAFETY NETWORK AL. COMP OBVIOUSLY IN THE FIRE FIRST RESPONDER- ARENAS- OUR SHARE OF DISASSOCIATION TO HAVE AGREEMENTS- BETWEEN ALL OF THEMSELVES HELP EACH OTHER OUT. THEY NEED TO. RESOURCES AND RELATIONSHIPS AND TAKEN THE NEXT LEVEL. THE QUOTED UP FOR SOME MORE QUESTIONS OUT HERE WILL START RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDDLE IN FRONT OF ME OUR OUT. WE'LL GET RIGHT TO YOU YOUR NUMBER TWO WELL FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR- WORK- HERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND ALSO FOR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY. PAT ALLUDED IN HIS LAST ANSWER TO MY QUESTION WHICH IS IN. OUR LEARNING PROCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA LEARNING HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NATURAL DISASTERS WE FACE- FIRST RESPONDERS- REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM FOR COORDINATION AND THAT THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM DEVELOPED OUT OF THAT AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN REPEATED DISASTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS A REALLY HIGH LEVEL OF COOPERATION AND COORDINATION IN THE FIRST RESPONSE BUT WHEN THE RESCUE PHASE OF A DISASTER IS OVER. AND WE GO INTO WHAT WE CALL THE SECOND RESPONSE WHICH IS EVEN RECOVER- THERE IS NO SYSTEM LIKE THAT- TO COORDINATE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VOLUNTEER GROUPS AND SO WE SEE- IN GENERAL LESS COOPERATION AND COORDINATION AMONG ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS IN RECOVERY AND AS CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASES THE THREAT MATRIX AND THE FREQUENCY AND SCOPE OF THE DISASTERS WERE FACING MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IT TIME FOR US TO CONSIDER SOME KIND OF INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM FOR THE SECOND RESPONSE IN DECLARED DISASTERS AND IF SO HOW WOULD WE- GO ABOUT DOING THAT. WHAT VI&amp;LT;C.CYAN&amp;GT; YES OF COURSE- THERE'S&amp;LT;/C&amp;GT; THERE THERE THAT THEY HAVE. FRAMEWORK TO THAT VERY WELL BOB VO AD IS ONE SUCH ORGANIZATION BUT THE- THE- SO MUCH OF IT IS A RECOGNIZING OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. THAT ARE. WORKING AS A SECOND RESPOND IS FINDING OUT WHO EACH OTHER LOUIS FOR THERE ARE BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU SOMEBODY THAT WAS- BACK IN THE MISTS OF TIME WAS AROUND WHEN THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM. STARTED WE DIDN'T GET ALONG. WE WERE JUST THERE AT THE SAME PLACE BUT WE WERE COMMUNICATING WELL- WE WERE SHARING. AND IF IT DID TAKE IT FOR FOUR DECADES TO GET TO WHERE. YOU KNOW IT THE THOMAS FIRE YEAH THE LARGEST MUTUAL AID RESPONSE FOR FIRE AND HISTORY UNITED STATES EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE. HERE AND THAT KIND OF GOT LOST WITH THE DEBRIS FLOW BUT- THE RECOGNITION OF THAT BUT- IT IT'S. IT'S BEEN FIGHTING TO GET THROUGH TO GET THE COMMUNICATION BETTER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK IN AND THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE POPULATED BUT IT ISN'T GONNA COME EASY IT'S NOT GOING TO COME UP. WITHOUT RESISTANCE THAT'S NOT CONNECT. WITH A BREAKING DOWN SOME WALLS. I CAN ANSWER THAT ON BEHALF OF THE STATE THANK YOU THE- AND HE THE MAX SYSTEM. YEARS IN ROWS TO GET IT RIGHT WE ARE STARTED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER RECOVERY FRAMEWORK THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO PLACE COUNTIES ARE DEVELOPING THAT AND THERE ARE RECOVERY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS THAT MATCH OUR EMERGENCY SUPPORT FUNCTIONS AND THERE ARE ECONOMIC THEIR HEALTH AND HOPE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HOUSING INFRASTRUCTURE. I DON'T NATURAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT TOOK US MANY MANY YEARS AND MANY MANY TRIALS AND HUGE TO PASTORS IN ORDER TO GET TO WORK OUR WITH THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND WE. ARE DOING THAT ON THE FOR THE RECOVERY SIDE BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A HUGE AGE GAP. AND SO WE ARE WORKING ON IT I WANTED THANKS FOR THAT. THOUGHT OF. IT IS AB AND WE'RE TRYING TO FILL IT. GOOD QUESTION I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. SO WILL FOLLOW UP AFTER THE COMMITTEE AND SEE WHAT YOU ALL ARE WORKING ON AND HOW WE MIGHT WORK TOGETHER EARLY NEXT YEAR AND ASSIST YOU IN. MAKING SOME PROGRESS THE. GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS ANOTHER SAVVY SO SOMETHING ON I'M NEWLY ELECTED BOARD PRESIDENT OF LIKE I SAID THAT I SAID I WANT TO THANK UNITS HAVE A MEAL. FOR A LIFTING UP THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE- DURING RECENT DISASTERS EVEN WHEN THE SCHOOLS WERE ALL CLOSE WE WERE THE ONE PLACE THAT WAS OPEN- YOU KNOW PROVIDING FREE CHILDCARE FOR A COMMUNITIES- AND IT'S JUST A POINT THAT WE ALL STRATEGICALLY. FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE FOR THE PLACES THAT ARE TRUSTED SPACES IN OUR COMMUNITY- BECAUSE WE DON'T US EVEN THOUGH WE DO ALL OF THIS WITH SO MUCH LOVE. LOVE DOESN'T PAY TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IT DOESN'T PAY TO DO ALL THE EXTRA WORK THAT IT TAKES TO DO THIS- AND ALSO I WANT TO THANK PAT FOR YOUR ANALYSIS AROUND. THIS BEING SUCH UP UP BASIC ISSUE AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE- AND I FEEL LIKE IF WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT. ALL OF WHAT WE DO AS A COLLECTIVE IT'S GONNA BE BANDAIDS AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THIS- IN A LARGER FRAME OF MIND BECAUSE WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND- THEY KEEP IT EXACERBATED. AS AS WELL IN YOUR HAND AND ALSO. YEAH EXTRANET THE IN. MY ORGANIZATION RUNS TWO ONE ONE VENTURE AND WE COVER. UP TWENTY ONE COUNTIES WITH TO ON COVERAGE REALLY PLEASED TO SUPPORT A SANTA BARBARA WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS- SO PARTIAL SOLUTION. TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM BUCKET BRIGADE- I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HERE IS REALLY ACCESS. SO IF YOU CAN NAME ALL OF THE PHONE NUMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. I WILL BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE AFTER THIS MEETING. I CAN'T DO THAT WELL YOU CAN ARE AT. YOUR ON- I CAN'T DO THAT AND THIS IS WHY TWO ONE ONE IS REALLY- A BRILLIANT SOLUTION FOR KNITTING TOGETHER THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE RESPONDING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT. THE RECOVERY PHASE THE SECOND PHASE. OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BECAUSE THESE. DISASTERS ARE TRIGGERING. MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE COMMUNITY TWO ONE ONE IS. RESPONDING TO THOSE KINDS OF NEEDS HOUSING FOOD MENTAL HEALTH. EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND THEN ALSO A DISASTER SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. A SEPARATE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC- SO FROM VENTURA COUNTY SORRY FOR BRINGING THE THOMAS FIRE YOUR THIS WAY- WE DID THAT THAT'S MY FAULT- BUT- WHAT- WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO HOWEVER IS TO REALLY. LINK PEOPLE WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED IN THE DISASTER POSTERS ASTOR. AND NOW FROM FOR THEIR SPECIAL POPULATION AS WELL AS AS- WHAT WE SAW YOU. THE I THINK FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE THOMAS FIRE WHERE YOU HAD PEOPLE. EATING WHO'VE NEVER REALLY HAD TO GO TO ANY KIND OF SOCIAL SERVICE. SYSTEM. FOR HELP BEFORE ON THERE REALLY FISH OUT OF WATER SO. THINK REALLY THAT ACCESS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO A LOT WITH. AND WE ACTUALLY JUST STARTED A DISASTER COMMUNITY INFORMATION EXCHANGE SYSTEM AND SO WERE WELCOMING ORGANIZATIONS TO JOIN INTO THAT. THIS IS A UNIQUE WAY TO BE ABLE TO- TO COLLABORATE AND DO THAT KIND OF CARE FOR CASE MANAGEMENT SO FOLKS DON'T DROP- BETWEEN- BETWEEN THE CRACKS. CHALLENGE THINGS HAPPEN SO ARE OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT TWO ON ONE BUT I REALLY THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE- CAN INVEST IN. ON 3% GOING UP TO ABOUT 99% VERY QUICKLY OF THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS- ON A CELL PHONE LANDLINE TO THEIR TWO ONE ONE IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HELLO EVERYONE OF LOS AFTER TODAY IT WAS BORN AND GREW UP HERE IN SANTA BARBARA. AND BACK IN THE SIXTIES AS A KID I REMEMBER. OUR FIRST DISASTER FIRE THE COYOTE FIRE THAT WAS NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR MEN OF THE PRINCES SCHOOL AT THAT TIME.

AS A KID AND SEEING SOME CONTROLLED BURNS OR ALSO KNOWN I GUESS AS FUEL BRAKES. AGENCY THAT. EVERY SO OFTEN IN THE SIXTIES AND THROUGHOUT THE SEVENTIES BUT NOT SO MUCH MIDDLE. NOW DAYS. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THIS IS STILL GOING ON. AND I THINK. ALSO. THAT MADE A PRETTY OWNERS THAT HAVE A LOT OF EDUCATION IN THE MUNCY IT'LL SYCAMORE BACK OF THE RIVIERA SHOULD YOU KNOW CLEAR THEIR VEGETATION. IT WOULD BE 1100% PERFECT BUT IT COULD SEEM HOMES COULD SAVE LIVES SO I'M JUST. DURING THE WEEK WE DO NEED SOME MORE CONTROLLED BURNS IN OUR STATE AND FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROP EIGHT WITH A LOT OF VEGETATION TO CLEAR THAT OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THAT'S IT. HI MANY IN THAT IT GIVES THEM THE- HERE I'M I'M HERE I CAN'T FIT ALL THE MANY HOUSE ON ONE LABEL- I THINK MY PRIMARY- ROLE HERE IS AS A- MOM OF A SON WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AT THE MARIE BROUGHT UP.

COULD HELP OTHER AREAS WITH DIFFERENT RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S NOT DIFFERENT ON PROFITS OR INCOME LEVEL PER CAPITA- SO THE MONEY CEDAR RECOVERY CENTER OF MUNCIE TO CENTER RECOVERY. REBUILDING IN BUSINESS. THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE REPLICATED WORK VERY WELL AS A HUB. IT DOESN'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD MATTER WHAT INCOME LEVEL A COMMUTE THE WHAT THERE WAS VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACE THAT AN OWNER COULD DONATE PROBABLY GET A TAX WRITE OFF FOR IT- IN THIS CASE THEY WITH THE SPACE WAS DONATED FOR SIX MONTHS FROM NOW OR FULLER FOUNDATION- SO- IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT TYPE OF BUILDING IT IS OUR SPACES.
