I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO THE JANUARY ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AT THIS TIME WE DO HAVE ENOUGH MEMBERS PRESENT TO ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. HERE. I DON'T CARE. HERE WOULD. WE HAVE A QUORUM. I WANT TO WELCOME OUR COMMITTEE I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME ALL MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO OUR COMMITTEE HEARING. ONA BE FIFTEEN OH SIX AND LET ME FIRST START BY WELCOMING. THE MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC% BOTH HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM AS WELL AS. OUTSIDE. TO. THE CAPITAL TO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE ARE AND I WANT TO ALSO JUST THINK ALL OF YOU FOR ENGAGING IN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT AND I KNOW WE HAVE A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES AND VIEWPOINTS ON THIS ISSUE BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. LET ME ALSO SAY AT THE OUTSET. THAT I ASK EVERYONE TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE PROSPECTIVE SPA THAT WE WILL BE HEARING TODAY AGAIN I KNOW THEY'RE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE AND I ASK FOR THAT RESPECT. LET ME START WITH SOME HOUSEKEEPING MATTERS DUE TO THE VERY HIGH TURNOUT AT THIS HEARING IN FACT WE'RE ESTIMATING WE HAVE PROBABLY. AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE AS CAN BE SEATED IN THIS HEARING ROOM. I'M GONNA TAKE A MOMENT TO TAK ABOUT THE ORDER OF BUSINESS WE'RE GONNA FIRST OPEN TODAY'S HEARING WITH TESTIMONY FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM WHO IS THE BILL AUTHOR. AS WELL AS FROM WITNESSES REPRESENTING THE SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. ARE WE WILL THEN BEGIN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE HEARING. AT THE BEGINNING A PUBLIC COMMENTS I'M GONNA FIRST GIVE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO DO NOT WISH TO SPEAK THE OPTION TO JUST RAISE YOUR HANDS. TO INDICATE IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WILL THEN BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENTS. THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION THE HEARING. WE'RE ESTIMATING OVER A THOUSAND FOLKS ACCORD HERE AND DUE TO THE NUMBER PEOPLE WHO WISHED TO BE PART OF PUBLIC COMMENT AND OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE. IS ABLE TO EXPRESS THEIR PERSPECTIVE WE WILL BE LIMITING PUBLIC COMMENT SIMPLY TOYOUR NAME. YOUR ORGANIZATION IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING ONE OR WHAT CITY YOU'RE FROM AND WHETHER YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE BILL. AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT THE COMMITTEE WILL TAKE A VOTE ON THE BILL. AYE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR COOPERATION. I'M GONNA START WITH SOME OPENING COMMENTS. AS OUR COMMITTEE KNOWS AS MANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC KNOW LAST YEAR WE PASSED A HISTORIC HOUSING PACKAGE REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. HAS BEGUN TO TACKLE THE STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS FIFTEEN BILLS ARE THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BEGIN TO MAKE A DOWN PAYMENT TOWARD ADDRESSING. THE WORST CRISIS OUR STATE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED. BUT THAT BEING SAID WE ALL KNOW THERE IS NO SILVER BULLET IT IS GOING TO TAKE A MULTI PRONGED EFFORT A MULTI YEAR EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY. CRISIS. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS HOUSING COSTS ONTINUE TO SOAR. OUR STATE IS THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN YOU FACTOR IN HOUSING COSTS CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE. IN THE COUNTRY THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. WE KNOW ALSO. AND LET ME ALSO ASK FOR QUIET IN SILENCE ARE WE DO NOT. AB JUST GONNA MAKE ANOTHER HOUSEKEEPING RULE. WE DO NOT PERMIT PEOPLE OUGHT TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENTARY DURING THE HEARING ARE AGAIN OUT OF RESPECT FOR. THE TESTIMONY AND FOLKS WERE SPEAKING. WE NOT ONLY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS WE ALSO HAVE A TENANT CRISIS. AT THIS TIME ONE THIRD OF ALL RENTERS PAY MORE THAN A HALF OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD RENT. WHEN YOU ADD TRANSPORTATION COST NUMBER JUMPS DRAMATICALLY. AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA RENTAL HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS OUT PACING INCOME GROWTH AT A LEVEL THAT IS SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE. AS OF THE END OF THIS PAST YEAR. IN MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO YOU SAW ONE BEDROOM APARTMENTS THAT ARE RENTING FOR ALMOST THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON AVERAGE. TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT RENTS ARE AVERAGING CLOSE TO FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. A RECENT STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PROJECTS TRIPLE DIGIT RENT INCREASES TO HIT MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO APP I SEE SURVEY FROM THIS PAST FALL. RENTERS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY AS HOMEOWNERS TO SAY THAT THERE HOUSING COSTS ARE CAUSING A FINANCIAL STRAIN SIXTY ONE PERCENT COMPARED TO THIRTY PERCENT. A AT THIS TIME A THIRD OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE SAYING THAT THE COST OF HOUSING IS MAKING THEM SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MOVING OUT OF THE STATE. OVER HALF OF ALL RENTERS ARE CONSIDERING LEAVING THEIR REGION OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF OUR COUNTRY'S HOMELESS. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HOMELESSNESS HAS RISEN STE FIFTEEN PERCENT STATEWIDE. CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF ALL PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE ALL KNOW THE IMPACTS OF THIS CRISIS ON TENANTS WHO COULD BE PRICED OUT OF THEIR HOMES DISPLACED FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES. AS A RESULT. BOB WE'RE GONNA SEE HEAR ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS PROPOSAL BUT I THINK EVERYONE HERE KNOWS THAT AB FIFTY NO SIX WOULD REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE NINETEEN. NINETY FIVE THERE HAS BEEN MOMENTUM AT BOTH THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT OUR SKYROCKETING HOUSING COSTS. I THINK EVERYONE HERE KNOWS WHERE NUMBER OF US STAND I AM A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC MY CITY IS IN CRISIS ARE AND THAT WAS REFLECTED BY THE FACT THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. HAS VOTED TO SUPPORT THIS BILL UP BUT MY CITYLIKE MANY CITIES AND AREAS AROUND THE STATE ARE ARE IN A CRISIS AND AND AND ARE RANCHERS NEED RELIEF SO WITH THAT. LET ME ASK IF THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WHO HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. AND IF NOT. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL. AND AT THIS TIME ALSO ASK. WITNESSES ARE ON THE SUPPORT SIDE IF YOU WOULD ALSO LIKE TO JOIN A MISTER BLOOM AT THE DíAS OF THE WITNESSES ON EACH SIDE WILL BE ABLE TO TESTIFY FOR NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES. ARE AND A AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WITNESSES COULD FIELD QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. MISTER BLOOM WELCOME. MORNING AND THANK YOU UP OF MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR. COMMITTEE MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE AND WHO ARE WATCHING AND OR LISTENING IN TO THIS VERY IMPORTANT DEBATE. MISTER CHAIR YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ME REPEAT SOME OF THE VERY REMARKS THAT YOU JUST MADE. I APPRECIATE YOUR COAUTHOR SHIP OF THIS BILL BUT I THINK THE THINGS THAT YOU JUST SAID MANY OF THEM BEAR REPEATING BECAUSE THEY ARE SO IMPORTANT AND SO CRITICAL. A IN THE DEBATE AND IN FACT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN LARGE PART DUE TO YOUR WORKS MISTER CHAIRMAN THE GOOD WORKS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGN NUMEROUS PIECES OF LANDMARK LEGISLATION ADDRESSING THE STATE'S RAPIDLY ESCALATING HOUSING CRISIS. WE CREATED NEW FUNDING STREAMS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF LAND ZONED FOR A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT MANY AREAS OF THE STATE. AND WE REMOVE BARRIERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. SO WE CAN BE OPTIMISTIC THAT OVER TIME THESE MEASURES WILL MAKE A MEANINGFUL DENTON THE CONSTRUCTION SHORTFALL THAT HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING. BUT WE HAVE TO BE FRANK WITH ONE ANOTHER. NEW UNITS INSUFFICIENT QUANTITIES WILL TAKE YEARS TO BUILD. IN THE MEANTIME. CURRENT DRAMATIC SHORTAGE OF UNITS CONTRIBUTES TO RAPIDLY ESCALATING RENTS IN MUCH OF THE STATE AFFECTING A VAST RANGE OF CALIFORNIANS ON A DAILY BASIS FROM YOUNG TO OLD. ACROSS ALL ETHNIC GROUPS AND EVEN INCLUDING THOSE HOLDING GOOD MIDDLE INCOME JOBS. NOT SURPRISINGLY. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO WEATHER THE ECONOMIC STORM OF THIS CRISIS ARE THE WEALTHY. ALSO NOT SURPRISINGLY POOR AND DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIANS ARE MOST DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED. AS RENTS INCREASE ON THOSE WITH LIMITED INCOMES QUALITY OF LIFE DECREASES IN INVERSE PROPORTION DIRECTLY AFFECTING THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR FOOD. UTILITIES MEDICATION FUEL SCHOOL SUPPLIES AND OTHER ESSENTIALS. FREQUENTLY IT EVENTUALLY LEADS TO DISPLACEMENT. PERHAPS TO COMMUNITY FAR AWAY THAT REQUIRES LONG COMMUTES THAT INCREASES TRAFFIC AND GREENHOUSE GASES. OR IT MAY MEAN TEMPORARY QUARTERS ON A FRIEND OR RELATIVE'S COUCH. BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER AFFORDABLE UNITS AVAILABLE FOR RENT. FOR MANY. FAR TOO MANY THE NEXT STOP IS HOMELESSNESS. AND UNDOUBTEDLY WILL NOT THE ONLY BECAUSE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTING BECAUSE OF THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS. THAT WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR MORE IN MANY AREAS JUST IN THE PAST YEAR. I NEEDN'T REMIND YOU THAT CALIFORNIA HAS NEARLY ONE QUARTER THE NATION'S HOMELESS AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND AND THAT'S UP FROM. ONE FIFTH. ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE STRUGGLING TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING CRISIS. THEY NEED ADDITIONAL TOOLS CRAFTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP SLOW RAPIDLY INCREASING RATS AND PROTECT RUNNERS WHO ARE FACING DISPLACEMENT. THIS IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY TO PROTECTING FAMILIES FROM BEING UPROOTED. BUT ALSO TO ENSURING AN ADEQUATE LOCAL WORKFORCE. AND MAINTAINING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. CONTINUING TO PRICE EVERYDAY CALIFORNIANS OUT OF THE HOUSING MARKET. WILL DAMAGE OUR ECONOMY HAS COMPANIES FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO RECRUIT TO RECRUIT EMPLOYEES. LOCAL GOVERNMENT CALIFORNIA HAVE LOOKED TO RENT CONTROL. AS ONE TOOL. FOR HELPING. NOW EVERY ADOPTED RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE IN CALIFORNIA'S DIFFERENT WHY. BECAUSE LONG BEFORE THE STATE INTERCEDED IN THE MATTER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND VOTERS WERE CRAFTING ORDINANCES UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THEIR LOCAL CONDITIONS. SOME PROVIDED FOR VACANCY DE CONTROL LONG BEFORE COSTA HAWKINS MANDATED. MANY EXEMPTED NEW CONSTRUCTION. ON THIS ISSUE I BELIEVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND VOTERS KNOW HOW TO BEST ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS. GIVEN THE CURRENT CRISIS. I THINK WE HAVE TO RETURN LOCAL DECISION MAKING TO WHERE IT FITS BEST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AGAIN AB FIFTEEN NO SIX SEEKS TO HELP CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AFFECTED. A DAY. BY EXORBITANT AND UNAFFORDABLE RENT INCREASES THAT THREATEN THEM WITH DISPLACEMENT. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN QUALITY OF LIFE. OR BOTH. A FEW YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHEN WE HOPE EXPANDED HOP HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES TAKE HOLD. THAT WILL BE TOO LATE. TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE FELLOW ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT HAS YET TO BE THE SUBJECT OF LEGISLATION OR INDEED OF MUCH CONVERSATION INTERNALLY HERE IN THE CAPITAL. AND IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. SURELY THAT WILL BE BE DEMONSTRATED BY TODAY'S HEARING. BUT IT IS IN MY OPINION A CONVERSATION THAT WE CAN NO LONGER AVOID. AND PRESENTS AN ISSUE THAT IS CRYING OUT FOR RELIEF AND LEGISLATIVE ACTION. OUR TEACHERS GROCERY STORE WORKERS CAR MECHANICS AND NURSES PEOPLE WHO WE INTERACT WITH. EACH AND EVERY DAY MANY OF WHOM HAVE LIVED AND WORKED IN OUR COMMUNITIES THEIR ENTIRE LIVES AND MAKEUP. FABRIC OF OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE BEING PRICED OUT. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE BARELY GETTING BY EACH MONTH OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE TAKEN POSITIVE STEPS TO ALLEVIATE THESE FINANCIAL STRESSES. WHEN INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE. INCREASED FUNDED CHILDCARE SLOTS INVESTED IN THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR WORKING FOR. BUT ALL OF THESE GAINES INTENDED TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE ARE COMPROMISED IF WE CAN'T CONTROL THE COST OF HOUSING. AB FIFTY KNOW SIX IS NOT A SILVER BULLET THAT'S GOING AND THE HOUSING CRISIS OVERNIGHT. I RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY REMOVING A BARRIER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PRESERVE SOME AFFORDABILITY AND NEIGHBORHOODS. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WILL NOT LEAD OVERNIGHT TO RENT CONTROL STATEWIDE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL STILL HAVE TO PASS THEIR OWN ORDINANCES TAILORED TO LOCAL CONDITIONS EITHER BY GOING TO THE VOTERS ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR COUNCIL OR BOARD. SOME CITIES AND COUNTIES WILL CHOOSE TO PURSUE RENT CONTROL POLICIES MANY AS HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WILL NOT. NOT ALL JURISDICTIONS ARE READY FOR RENT CONTROL WE HAVE RECENT LOCAL ATTEMPTS IN SANTA ROSA BURLINGAME AND ALAMEDA THAT. WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL. SO IN CONCLUSION THIS MEASURE IS BUT ONE TOOL FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND FOR OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WE HAVE THAT CAN RIGHT NOW HELP OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND I WON INTRODUCED THREE WITNESSES THAT ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY. ALLISON REGAN WITH THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD DEAN PRESTON WITH TENANTS TOGETHER AND SINEAD FRANKLIN. WHO IS A FORMER APPOINTEE TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING COMMISSION AND THE BAY AREA RENTER? THANK YOU. BLOOM. WELL TURNED OVER TO EUROPE WITNESSES AND WHATEVER YOU HAVE. WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ALLISON REGAN I'M A DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM STATED THIS IS A LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS WILL NOT RESULT IN RENT CONTROL STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND ONLY SIXTEEN CITIES CURRENTLY HAVE ORDINANCES ON THEIR BOOKS. BUT IN THE AREAS WHERE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS MOST ACUTE AND WHERE RENT STABILIZATION HAS PROVEN EFFECTIVELY TO PREVENT DISPLACEMENT OF LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. POPULATIONS BY THE WAY WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO A ROBUST ECONOMY THESE AREAS THE STATE SHOULD NOT MANDATE HOW THOSE ORDINANCES ARE IMPLEMENTED. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. AND ALSO THESE ORDINANCES ARE EACH UNIQUE SOME OF THEM ALREADY MOST OF THEM IN FACT EXEMPT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES DUPLEXES TRI PLEX THE SMALLER PROPERTIES. TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ECONOMIC REALITIES IN THEIR AREAS. ALSO WANTED TO POINT OUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. OF USING THE COST OF USING COSTA HAWKINS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ELLIS ACT. COSTA HAWKINS ALREADY CREATES A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE. TO FOR LANDLORDS TO A DRIVE EXISTING TENANTS OUT OF THEIR UNITS SO THAT THESE UNITS CAN BE RENTED AT MARKET RATES. WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ELLIS ACT IT'S COSTA HAWKINS ON STEROIDS. THE OTHER SIDE ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO EMPTY ENTIRE BUILDINGS OF TENANTS. OSTENSIBLY TO LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET. BUT THE MEAGER PENALTIES OF THE ALICE ACT ARE DWARFED IN COMPARISON TO THE PROFITS TO BE MADE WITH VACANCY DE CONTROL UNDER COSTA HAWKINS. THEREFORE WHEN USING CONJUNCTION WITH THE ELLIS ACT COSTA HAWKINS HAS LED TO THE PERVERSE CONSEQUENCE OF INCENTIVIZING HARASSMENT AND ABUSE IN AREAS. WHERE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS MOST ACUTE? FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT LIKE SAKE THAT CITIES LIKE WEST HOLLYWOOD SANTA MONICA. AND SAN FRANCISCO. TIME ITSELF. MAY I FINISH MY STATE YOU CAN FINISH YOUR SENTENCE THINK WE HAVE ALL STEPPED UP IN RESPONSE TO THE STATE'S EVER INCREASING DEMANDS. TO INCREASE GREATER AND HAVE GREATER AND DENSER DEVELOPMENT THE STATE SHOULD NOT THEREFORE TIE THE CITY'S HANDS IN CRAFTING EVEN MORE SOLUTIONS TO SOLVE THIS CRISIS THANK YOU. YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WITNESS PLACE. THE MORNING MY NAME IS SHOULD NAY FRANKLIN MINOR AND. IVORY A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE TODAY I SERVED AS AN APPOINTEE UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN FOR THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING COUNCIL. AND I TRAVELED THE STATE HEARD FROM MANY CALIFORNIANS ABOUT THEIR FEAR OF DISPLACEMENT BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND PERSPECTIVE OF A SMALL LANDLORD LIKE MY GRANNY WHO WAS A SHARECROPPER SHE MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO LIVED IN THE HOUSING PROJECTS. BOUGHT AN APARTMENT BUILDING BY SAVING HER MONEY CLEANING OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND SHE RENTS IT OUT TO SECTION EIGHT TENANTS TO GIVE BACK. NOW I MOVE BACK TO MY COMMUNITY IN OAKLAND. AFTER LAW SCHOOL AND MARRIED MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART. AND WE ENDED UP RENTING A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I GREW UP IN WE'RE RAISING OUR TWO DAUGHTERS WHO LIVE THERE FOR TEN YEARS. BECOME A BIG PART OF THAT COMMUNITY AND JUST LAST YEAR OUR LANDLORD RAISED R. RENT BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. THEY GIVE US A TWO MONTHS NOTICE FOR THIS INCREASE WAS OVER A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE. AND THEY COULD DO THIS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS. NOW WE LIVE THERE AS I SAID FOR TEN YEARS. WE'VE PAID MORE IN RENT THAN THEY PAID ME PURCHASE THE HOME OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO. NOT KNOWING ARGUES THAT WE'RE ENTITLED TO EQUITY IN OUR HOUSE. THAT'S THEIR PROPERTY RIGHT. BUT AT A MINIMUM WE'RE ENTITLED TO STABILITY. THAT'S A HUMAN RIGHT. SO I URGE YOU TODAY TO STAND WITH THE FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHO ARE USE HOUSING IS BEING HELD IN THE BALANCE BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS THANK YOU? THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER PRESTON. GOOD MORNING. SHARE CHU AND. AB MEMBERS WE CAN MAKE SURE MIKE IS ON THANK YOU LET'S RESTART THE TIME GREAT THANK YOU COME MORNING. DEAN PRESIDENT THAT COULD OF DIRECTOR OF TENANTS TOGETHER CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION FOR RENTERS RIGHTS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU. TODAY AYE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN OH SIX. AS WE'VE HEARD CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST RENTS IN THE NATION AND SOME OF THE WORST CONDITIONS FOR TENANTS I CALIFORNIA TENANTS ARE BEING GOUGED EVERY DAY ACROSS THE STATE. AND ASK YOUR CHU NOTED. THIRD OF TENANTS PAY OVER HALF OF THEIR INCOME TO RENT. TENANTS TOGETHER OPERATES A STATEWIDE HOTLINE. WHERE WE TALK WITH TENANTS ACROSS? ALL OF THE STATE ABOUT THEIR HOUSING ISSUES WE JUST HAD A CALL LAST WEEK FROM THE RICHMOND. RESIDENT IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL. BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS AYE SHE RECEIVED A ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN PERCENT RENT INCREASE HER RENT WENT FROM SEVENTEEN FIFTY TO THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH THAT'S NOT A RENT INCREASE NOTICED THAT'S AN EVICTION NOTICE. AND WE GET SIMILAR CALLS FROM TENANTS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE EVERY DAY AND THE VICTIMS OF THESE KIND OF ABUSIVE RENT INCREASES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. PEOPLE OF COLOR. SENIORS IMMIGRANTS AND WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING ALREADY FOR DAILY SURVIVAL AND THEN FACE THESE KIND OF INCREASE. NONE OF THIS IS INEVITABLE IT IS BECAUSE OF UNCHECKED REAL ESTATE SPECULATION. AND INDUSTRY WRITTEN LAWS LIKE COSTA HAWKINS COSTA HAWKINS ENCOURAGES RUN AWAY RENTS INCENTIVIZE EVICTIONS AND REDUCES THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANKS TO COSTA HAWKINS A GROWING NUMBER OF UNITS IN CALIFORNIA ARE TOTALLY EXEMPT FROM ANY RENT LIMITS WHATSOEVER AND COSTA HAWKINS INCENTIVIZE THIS LANDLORDS ENTERING CONTROL CITIES TO KICK OUT. AFFORDABLY HOUSE TENANTS SO THEY CAN REALIZE ON LIMITED RENT INCREASES FOR THE NEW TENANTS. AB FIFTEEN OH SIX WILL ALLOW CITIES TO CRAFT APPROPRIATE POLICIES. TECH TENANTS FROM EXCESSIVE RENT INCREASES AND DISPLACEMENT THE BILL MANDATES NOTHING BUT FUN TIES THE HANDS OF A LOCAL OFFICIALS TO SOLVE AN ACUTE CRISIS. THE LANDLORD LOBBY IS FULLY CAPABLE OF WAY. MAY I JUST FINISH THE CENTER COULD FINISH THE SENTENCE THINK IF THE WOMEN LOBBYIST FULLY CAPABLE OF WEIGHING IN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS THEY DO AND WE KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE SPARRED WITH THEM OVER RENT CONTROL LOCALLY. AYE IN MANY COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T NEED OR DESERVE THE STATE THROUGH COSTA HAWKINS PUTTING A THUMB ON THE SCALE IN FAVOR OF EXCESSIVE RENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE ASK FOR AND I'VE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COLLEAGUES UNLESS YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL QUESTIONS TO THE SUPPORT WITNESSES I'D LIKE TO INVITE UP THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES TO MAKE THEIR STATEMENTS AND THEN. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY ASK QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION BEFORE. PUBLIC COMMENT. SO THIS TIME I LIKE TO INVITE THE OPPOSITION. TO THE DíAS. I THINK WE'VE THREE SEATS SO EVERYONE CAN STAY SITTING AT THE HEARING TABLE. WE HAVE WITH US DEMóCRATAS OF FROM CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION CENTER RAY FROM FBI MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND CREAM THERESA GREASY FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF REALTORS EACH OF YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AS. IN THE ORDER THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED. SCOTT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DEBORAH CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION YOU KNOW I HATE TO DATE MYSELF BUT I WAS HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WHEN WE PASSED COSTA HAWKINS. YOU KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT ARE THE LEGISLATURE AGREED TO DO THAT BECAUSE AFTER TWENTY YEARS OF EXTREME RIGHT CONTROLLING R. LURKED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WE SAW WE HAD LOST A LOT OF HOUSING. WE SAW THAT WE HAD LOST. PEOPLE WHO HAD MOVED. TO NEIGHBORING. JURISDICTIONS GENTRIFICATION AND NEW CONSTRUCTION HAD COME TO A NEAR HALT. TODAY HOUSING PRICES ARE NOT INCREASING BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY WE AGREE. WITH THE PROPONENTS HERE THAT HOUSING PRICES ARE INCREASING BUT I WILL SAY IT'S BECAUSE. WE HAVE NOT DONE OUR JOBS AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION I HAVE TO COMMEND THIS BODY YOU HAVE DONE GREAT WORK. WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE HOUSING PACKAGE AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT WE BELIEVE COSTA HAWKINS WILL PUT A HALT ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE ALREADY DONE. I'M IN RECENT REPORTS THE STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST CONCLUDED THAT RENT CONTROL WILL DO NOTHING. TO INCREASE OUR SUPPLY AND IN FACT WILL DISCOURAGE NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND WHILE IN THE BAY AREA YOU SEE CRANES IN THE AIR EVERY DAY. IN FACT WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND NEW HOUSING UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN THE PAST YEARS. THAT SEEMS LIKE A BOOM INTO YOUR REALIZE THAT WE CREATED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW JOBS AT THE SAME TIME. THEY'RE COMING IN IN MASS AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO HOUSING ECAUSE OUR BALANCE OF JOBS AND HOUSING IS NOT THERE. YOU KNOW THE HOUSING COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT AB FIFTY NO SIX DOES NOT REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT RENT CONTROL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEY DON'T. BUT CURRENTLY RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS ALREADY TOLD US THEY WILL ADOPT MORE EXTREME FORMS OF RENT CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF RENTAL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LOCATED IN SMALL MOM AND POP. HOMES AND YOU ARE ALSO RIGHT SECONDS IN. YOU ARE ALSO CORRECT THAT THE ELLIS ACT HAS BEEN USED BECAUSE OWNERS HAVE WALKED OUT THEY'VE LEFT. THEY HAVE LEFT THE MARKET AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT AGAIN. BECAUSE OF THE ELLA SATURDAY WILL BE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE A LIVING TURN CONCLUSION. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE MORE EXTREME RIGHT BECAUSE I CAN'T TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU IF I COULD ASK MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC DURING THE TESTIMONY OF MISTER CARLTON SHE WAS INTERRUPTED A NUMBER OF TIMES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS SPARE TIME SO. I APPRECIATE THE JAZZ HANDS OR IN SOME INSTANCES KNOW OF IT THAT GIVES US SOME INDICATION WITHOUT INTERRUPTING SPEAKERS. AND I WOULD UP I'D AND ASK FOR THAT. SILENCE INDICATION OF WHERE FOLKS ARE THINKING IS CARLTON LET'S PROCEED TO THE NEXT WITNESS. AB MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY MY NAME IS CYNTHIA RAY SENIOR DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITIONS WITHOUT PI MANAGEMENT. OUR COMPANY MANAGES SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND RENTAL HOUSING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THOUSANDS OF OWNERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS SENIOR DIRECTOR OF ACQUISITIONS MY ROLE IS TO HELP CLIENTS DEVELOP AND GET NEW RENTAL PROJECTS APPROVED AND BUILT. THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON NEW RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE FUTURE OF COSTA HAWKINS HAS ALREADY PUT A NUMBER. OF A NUMBER OF. NEW SITES ON HOLD. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR MANY YEARS WITH ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATING TO LAND AND% CONSTRUCTION THESE PROJECTS WILL SIMPLY NOT PENCIL. IF SUBJECTED TO RENT CONTROL FOR LIFE. I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND THAT I'M WORKING WITH DEVELOPERS ON TWO DIFFERENT HOUSING. PROJECTS RIGHT HERE IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO THAT WOULD BRING OVER EIGHT HUNDRED UNITS OF NEW HOUSING MANY OF THEM AFFORDABLE. BOTH DEVELOPERS HAVE PUT THEIR PROJECTS ON HOLD AND ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS OTHER OPTIONS GIVEN THE BILL'S CALL FOR RENT CONTROL IN SACRAMENTO. AND A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE. I HAVE CLIENTS HAVE FOUND THAT BUILDING PROJECTS IN NEIGHBORING STATES IS PREFERRED BECAUSE OF THE PREDICTABILITY AND HE'S OF CONSTRUCTION. I HONOR CLIENTS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT FIND THEMSELVES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS EITHER SLOWING DOWN PROJECTS ARE RECONSIDERING THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND COSTA HAWKINS. AS A COMPANY WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT CALIFORNIANS FACE WHILE AB FIFTEEN NO SEX MAY HELP SOME TENANTS IN THE VERY SHORT TERM. IT WILL HAVE A DEVASTATING IMPACT IN THE LONG RUN AND WILL WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER HOUSING COSTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THAT MOST OF THE NEW HOUSING BUILT TODAY WAS ACTUALLY APPROVED AND HAS BEEN IN THE PROCESS FOR FIVE TO TEN YEARS. IF A BE FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN COMES ALONG FIVE SECONDS WE ARE GOING TO SEE A FAR FEWER NEW HOUSING PROJECTS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. ON BEHALF UP. OF OUR BUILDER AND ALL FOR CLIENTS. I WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON AB FIFTEEN OF SIX THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND FINAL WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIFTY NO SIX FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. IT'S MURDER MEMBERS OF THE COSTA HAWKINS RENTAL HOUSING ACT WAS A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE A REACHED BY A BROAD SPECTRUM OF HOUSING GROUPS BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. AB FIFTEEN NO SIX SEEKS TO UNDO THIS LONGSTANDING LAW BY REPEALING IT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS BILL WOULD DISCOURAGE THE CREATION OF RENTAL HOUSING AND IMPAIR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. WHICH IS ANTITHETICAL TO THE STATED GOAL OF THE BILL. NEEDLESS TO SAY CA OUR CONTINUES TO BE A MAJOR PROPONENT OF AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING AND SUPPORTED MANY OF THE BILL'S CONTAINED IN LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATIVE HOUSING PACKAGE. THOSE MEASURES ADDRESSED THE TWO MAIN FACETS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. WHICH OR THE LACK OF FUNDING AND THE LACK OF SUPPLY ADDITIONALLY THE SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF MANY OF THOSE MEASURES. CAN BE ATTRIBUTED. AND WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH COMPROMISE IN BRINGING HOUSING ADVOCATES TOGETHER FROM ALL SIDES. AND SEE OUR FEELS AS THOUGH. WILD HOUSING PACKAGE WAS SUCCESSFUL WE FEEL AS THOUGH WE TOOK TWO STEPS FORWARD WITH RESPECT THAT HOUSING PACKAGE IN TERMS OF HELPING TO ALLEVIATE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. BUT NOW WITH AB FIFTEEN NO SIX WE FEEL IS THAT WE'RE TAKING A STEP BACKWARDS. AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE AB FIFTEEN OF SIX NEITHER ADDRESSES THE LACK OF FUNDING NOR THE LACK OF SUPPLY AND TO THE CONTRARY WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISH EXISTING RENTAL HOUSING STOCK. AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOUSING THAT'S A CERTAINLY SIERRA LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE. ON OTHER. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITHOUT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE LEMME ASK IF THERE ANY QUESTIONS. ABSOLUTELY SO ARE WE WILL IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS I ACTUALLY HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS BUT IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS. WE CAN PROCEED TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. DOCTOR WHAT. PALM THINK YOU MISTER BLOOM FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO HAVE A QUESTION I I AM NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE. SO I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ELLIS ACT SO. IS AT A STATE ACT A FEDERAL ACT. AND WHY IS THAT NOT UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR POTENTIAL REFORM AS WELL. ALAS. ALAS MS REAGAN TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION IF THAT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU AND WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO VOTE FROM THE OUTSIDE IS A STATE LAW IT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. AND THAT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A SUPREME COURT CASE WHICH PROHIBITED LANDLORDS FROM EXITING THE RENTAL MARKET SO IT WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW LANDLORDS WHO NO LONGER WANTED TO BE LANDLORDS. TO PEGS AT THE RENTAL MARKET THE PROBLEM IS IS WHEN COSTA HAWKINS WAS PASSED LATER IT THEN CREATED THIS THAT AND AS RENTS HAVE CONTINUE TO SKYROCKET TO WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. IT'S WHEN IT'S USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH ELLIS AND THAT'S WHY THE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE ELLIS ITSELF IS NOT SO PROBLEMATIC BUT IT CREATES THIS INCENTIVE. TO DRIVE TENANTS OUT OF ENTIRE BUILDINGS SO THAT THEN THE LANDLORD CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ABILITY TO REROUTE THOSE UNITS AT MARKET RATES. AND THE ELLIS ACT DOES PROVIDE PENALTIES FOR DOING SO BUT THOSE PENALTIES ARE SO MEAGER. THAT THE PROFITS TO BE MADE ENCOURAGE LANDLORDS TO ABUSE BOTH OF THESE LAWS AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY DRASTICALLY. THE OPPOSITION HAVE A UNIQUE. I THINK THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD THE ELLIS ACT DOES ALLOW RENTAL PROPERTIES TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS BUT YOU CANNOT RE RANCHER UNITS THERE ARE PENALTIES FOR DOING SO IN OF CITIES ARE ENFORCING THOSE. I WOULD TURN TO THE CITY AND SAY WHY ARE YOU ENFORCING THOSE LAWS YOU HAVE TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS YOU HAVE TO CONVERT IT TO YOUR OWNER OCCUPIED OR NOT. I USE IT AT ALL SO THOSE ARE THE ONLY ALLOWANCES IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE YOUR RENTAL UNIT OFF OF THE MARKET. I'M. NO THE QUESTION THAT JUST A QUESTION I'M. QUITE FRANKLY I AM NOT USE TO SEEING A BILL THAT HAS BASICALLY JUST ONE LINE. SO THERE. SO MY QUESTION IS. WHERE THERE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IF YOU MISTER BLOOM DID YOU MEET WITH BOTH SIDES AND BECAUSE TYPICALLY WE SEE IN OUR PROCESS WE USUALLY SEE? BILLS COME FORWARD AND PROPOSED A MET AMENDMENTS AND SO ON BUT I HAVE. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS OUR BEEN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS HERE TO BRING EVERYONE TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN. OPENING CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS WITH. ANY AND ALL SIDES ON THIS ISSUE THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS BUT. THIS IS A VERY POLARIZED ISSUE AND FRANKLY NOT THAT MANY. GOT PEOPLE HAVE. HAVE RESPONDED WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN. SUPPORT OR OPPOSE. SO SO THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY HAVE HAS THE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. YOU SAID THERE BECAUSE IT HAS OUR BEEN ANY SORT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW WE GOT WHERE WE HER SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOU MEAN BY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. OVER SUPERFINAL BRING NORMAL HE REBUILDING PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE ARE INVITED TO TWO WAY AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND COME TO OUR OFFICE. MIGHT I HAVE AN OPEN DOOR POLICY AND AND IN MY OFFICE WE DON'T TURN ANYONE AWAY FOR A. FROM CONVERSATION AND. THAT THAT DOOR WILL REMAIN OPEN. DOCTOR WELL ANSWER THE QUESTION IN PART SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN VERY WILLING TO CONVENE. A STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION IF ONE IS DESIRE BUT AT THIS POINT WITH THIS ISSUE. AYE I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST TO. TO ENGAGE WITH THAT BY EITHER SIDE. TAKE THE MESSENGER ELECT UNUSUAL LITTLE MORE ARTICULATE AND LESS AND WILL LIKE TO CONTRADICT THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MR STONE. THANK YOU IT'S BLOOM AT THIS POINT PROP YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS BY. THE THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THE. THE CLAIM FOR THE FOR LACK OF HOUSING THAT THAT THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE. IT CONTINUE. LACK OF HOUSING I THINK FOR THOSE OF US. WHO'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING IN DEVELOPMENT IN. OUR JURISDICTIONS AS A AS OF LOCAL ELECTED AS WE HEAR THAT QUITE A BIT DOESN'T ALWAYS. PAN OUT TO BE. EXACTLY TRUE AND ESPECIALLY WITH A AN ISSUE LIKE THIS THAT THAT IS SO POLARIZED EVERYONE'S KIND OF JUMPING INTO THE MOST. EXTREME. POSITION ON IT IN IN ORDER TO MAKE A POINTS BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO BE COGNIZANT. OF ANY BALANCING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IF WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING SOME POTENTIAL THREAT TO THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW HOUSING ESPECIALLY LOW INCOME HOUSING RENTAL HOUSING WHICH IS VERY. NEEDED IN A LOT OF OUR AREAS COASTAL JURISDICTIONS THAT THAT HAVE A REAL DEARTH OF OF RENTAL HOUSING SUCH HOPING THAT YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT I CERTAINLY. AGREE WITH YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. AS A. SUPPORTER OF AND AUTHOR OF. SOME OF THOSE BILLS THAT ARE INTENDED TO INCREASE THE HOUSING SUPPLY THINK IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE OF MR PRESS AND I THINK IN AT SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON THAT TO. ON SPECIFICS ABOUT IT NAMED HIM AND AND. AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT FRUSTRATIONS OF THOSE OF US WHO. SUPPORT RENT CONTROL LAWS THAT SO OFTEN AND THE ARGUMENT IS ADVANCED WITH NO DATA TO SUPPORT IT WHATSOEVER THAT THE IMPOSITION OF RENT CONTROL AND A COMMUNITY WILL LEAD. TO. NO NEW CONSTRUCTION OR DETERRENCE CUT TO CONSTRUCTION THESE ARE THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE EVERY TIME AGAINST RENT CONTROL BEFORE CITY ADOPT SENT. AND IT DOES NOT PAN OUT TO FACTORS THAT GO INTO WHETHER HOUSING GETS BUILT OBVIOUSLY INCLUDING WHAT INTEREST RATES ARE. MATERIALS COST ZONING LAWS ON AND THE INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDABLY POINTS TO RENT CONTROL. AS A DETERRENT TO HOUSING I WANTED TO JUST IN RESPONSE THE FOCUS THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC STUDIES. THAT THAT SUPPORT THE POSITION THAT NOT ONLY IS RANKED OWN NOT TO TURN CONSTRUCTION WHO ARE FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT ESTABLISHED THE RENT CONTROL DID NOT ADVERSELY. IMPACT THE CONSTRUCTION OF RENTAL HOUSING. THERE WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE STUDY BY APPLE BAND THAT WAS PREPARED FOR THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE. THAT ESTABLISHED NOT ONLY THAT RENT CONTROL PRIMARILY BENEFITS A LITTLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHICH WE ALL KNOW UP BUT ALSO THAT IT DID NOT DSCOURAGE THE CONSTRUCTION OF OF NEW HOUSING. AND IN FACT THAT BERKELEY AND SANTA MONICA TO CITIES THAT HAD STRICT. RENT CONTROL WITH VACANCY CONTROL PROVISIONS ACTUALLY DID BETTER THAN OTHERS. CITIES ON AND STOOD OUT FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AUTHORED WHAT'S IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX THE BERKELEY RAMP OR COMMISSIONED A STUDY LOOKING AT NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO TWO THOUSAND FIVE CONSTRUCTION. AYE AND FOUND A HIGHER PRODUCTION. OF HOUSING PER CAPITA IN RENT CONTROL CITIES WHEN THEY STUDIED ALL THE BAY AREA CITIES AND MOST RECENTLY JUST LAST YEAR OF THE HAAS INSTITUTE I ISSUED A STUDY. AND THEY SAID AYE AYE QUOTE WHEN WE LOOK AT HOUSING TRYING TO HALT A PRODUCTION. I THINK YOU AND THEN I ALSO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS NOT REALLY BEEN RAISED BUT I BUT I KNOW IS THE KEY ISSUE. IS THE ONE OF THE. ECONOMICS AND I THINK MOST ECONOMISTS FEEL THE RENT CONTROL IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE OF COURSE A LOT OF WHAT WE DO IS NOT. STRICTLY BY THE BOOK WITH RESPECT TO WHAT ECONOMISTS WANT OR DON'T WANT. OUR ENTIRE TAX SYSTEM. WHAT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH ECONOMIC SENSE AND SO FOR US AGAIN THERE THERE ARE TRADE OFFS WHEN WE'RE DOING SOMETHING AND I DON'T DISAGREE? WITH THE ANALYSES OF THE IMPACT THAT GREAT CONTROL DOES HAVE ON THE ECONOMY BUT YET WE'RE WE'RE PLAYING WITH AN ECONOMY THAT IS SURE SO. HAS PROGRESSED SO FAR IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION THAT SOMETIMES IT IS UP TO GOVERNMENT PROVIDE SOME BALANCE IN IN THE RAIN THAT IT SO PERHAPS YOU COULD COMMENT ON. THAT THE ECONOMICS OF IT BUT COURSE. IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT HEAVILY LOADED BECAUSE ALL WE'RE DOING IS APPEALING COSTA HAWKINS. BUT I THINK LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE GONNA HAVE TO DO THEIR OWN ECONOMICANALYSIS ABOUT WHAT THAT IMPACT IS VERSES THEIR PARTICULAR RENTAL MARKET. WHAT THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS ARE WHAT THEIR SUPPLIES ARE WITH THEIR DEMANDS ARE SO IT'S IT'S? IT'S NOT NECESSARILY EASY THING TO ANSWER BUT I JUST LOOKING FOR A COMMENT ON HOW WE BALANCE THE THE ECONOMIC FOR THE BALLOT ECONOMIC CRITICISMS. OF. WHAT RATE CONTROL DOES VERSUS OPENING THIS UP TO JURISDICTIONS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT DECISION? I'LL JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT I THINK REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS. ALLOWING THE INDIVIDUAL CITIES TO ADDRESS THEIR PARTICULAR ECONOMIC NEEDS IS THE BALANCE THAT NEEDS TO BE STRUCK SO IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT AREAS THAT ARE HARDEST HIT BY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WHERE. FAMILIES ARE BEING DISPLACED THEY'RE MOVING ON NOT ONLY OUT OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SOMETIMES OUT OF THE REGION. THAT HARMS THESE AREAS ECONOMICALLY IT ALSO HARMS USERS ECONOMICALLY WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORK THEY CAN'T BE PART OF THAT COMMUNITY. THAT'S A WELL DOCUMENTED ECONOMIC HARDSHIP SO ALLOWING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO GOVERN TO DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS ARE BASS BY NOT TAKING AWAY ALL OF THE TOOLS IN THEIR TOOL BOX. THAT WILL EASE THAT ECONOMIC STRESS. THANK YOU A SHOULD I NAY FROM WEST HOLLYWOOD BUT. BECAUSE THE BAY AREA WHERE THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING BY. HOUSING CRISIS IS VERY VERY REAL AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT ECONOMIC BOOM THE UNDERLYING. ECONOMIC LOSS FOR VARIOUS STRAT OF OUR SOCIETY IS REALLY CRITICAL THAT THEY AREAS TO SUCH A DICHOTOMY OF OF WIN AND LOSE RIGHT IN THE SAME AREAS THAT. IT'S REALLY VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM AT AT ASSEMBLYMEMBER WE WE SEE THAT SAME DYNAMIC IN WEST HOLLYWOOD AND IN SANTA MONICA. IN WEST LOS ANGELES. IN MY DISTRICT. SO I THINK WE ACTUALLY TRY SIERRA FORTUNATELY WE SHARE. THE SAME THE SAME ISSUES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER STONE LET'S TURN IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER STEINORTH. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER BRING THIS BILL FORD I THINK IS A DISCUSSION THAT. HAS BEEN. DISKS REALLY BROUGHT AROUND FOR A LONG TIME IN AND I TAKE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF. COURSE I'M I'M LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SIDE OF HOW WE INCREASE THE. SUPPLY OF HOUSING WOULD BE ABLE TO REALLY PROVIDING AND SOLVE ALL OF THESE CONCERNS I I WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS THE OPPOSITION IF YOU DON'T MIND. DEALING WITH SUPPLY QUESTIONS. SO I'VE READ THE RECENTLY A REPORT IT'S RECOMMENDING THAT HOUSING INCENTIVIZING THE BUILDING OF MORE HOUSING IS BEING THE BEST APPROACHES TO SOLVING THE STATEWIDE HOUSING CRISIS. WOULDN'T RENT CONTROL REALLY PUT A DAMPER ON. PEOPLE'S INCENTIVES TO BUY ME BY WHAT IT DEVELOPER BUILD MORE HOMES ARE WHY WOULD A A HOMEOWNER DECIDE TO RENT OUT THEIR HOME. IF THEY DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR OWN PRIVATE PROPERTY. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE QUESTION YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S DID SAY THAT THAT RENT CONTROL WILL DO NOTHING TO INCREASE HOUSING SUPPLY AND IN FACT WOULD INTERFERE WITH HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. IS PROBABLY THE DUELING. THE DUELING STUDIES IF YOU WILL STANFORD UNIVERSITY FOUND IT CITIES WITH LANDLORDS WHOSE PROPERTIES WERE COVERED BY RENT CONTROL RUSE REDUCE THEIR SUPPLY BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. AGAIN WE HAVE THE SMALL OWNERS WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR FEAR OF RENT CONTROL ON THE WAY THAT WOULD APPLY TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. SO IF IN FACT WE END UP WITH EXTREME FORMS OF RENT CONTROL LIKE WE DO THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN WE SAW. HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. SLOWING DOWN I THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT IN OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. MISS RAY ALSO HAS A A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE DEVELOPERS OF TOLD HER WE'RE GONNA STOP WE'RE GONNA STOP RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO SEE WHAT THE STATE INITIATIVE WILL DO AND IF IT DOES ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO PASS MORE EXTREME FORMS OF RENT CONTROL WERE NOT GOING TO PROCEED. VERY GOOD MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS WILL HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HOMES WE RECENTLY SAW WITH THE TRAGIC FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THE ESTIMATES ARE TEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED NINETEEN HOMES WERE DESTROYED IN THOSE PLACES. YOU KNOW MY CONCERN IS WHAT'S THE INCENTIVE FOR DEVELOPERS AND FOR HOMEOWNERS TO GO AHEAD AND AND REBUILD OR TO REPURCHASE THOSE HOMES AB AND THEN WE COUPLE THAT ALSO WITH. THE DISCUSSIONS OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS ABOUT APPLYING SPLIT ROLE. SPLIT WILL TAXATION WHICH WOULD LEAD YOU TO MODIFY PROP THIRTEEN ANY ANY COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION OR ANY HOUSING UNITS SINGLE FAMILY DWELLING THAT WOULD BE OPEN FOR RENT WOULD THEN BE. I'M SUBJECT TO CURRENT REASSESSMENT OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY HOW IN THE WORLD COULD YOU. TAKE THOSE TWO ELEMENTS AND SAY THAT WE WANT TO. REVALUED THE PROPERTY TAXES AND BUT YET WE'RE GOING TO CONTROL HOW MUCH YOU'RE ABLE TO RENT YOUR YOUR PERSONAL PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR. YOU HAVE AN INCREASE IN COST ON ONE SIDE YOU HAVE A. DECREASES SPARSE THE AMOUNT YOU'RE ABLE TO CHARGE HOW IN THE WORLD TO WE POSSIBLY SEE THAT WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE HOLD ON TO HOMES AND NOT JUST GO AHEAD AND SELL THEM. AND YET YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ALSO FACE IN FACT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM FACES IS THAT THE% ENEMIES OF THE NOT MY BACKYARD INDIVIDUALS COME TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. PUT PRESSURE ON THE OFFICIALS TO STOP HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR THE NEWBIES THEY CAN STOP HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM AS WE GO FORWARD. IF WE DON'T ALL TOGETHER THE SNAPPERS IN THE ROOM DON'T COME TOGETHER WE ALL COME TOGETHER AND PROMOTE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IF WE ALL CAME TOGETHER IN THE BUSES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND DEMANDED THE HOUSING PRODUCTION WE WOULD SEE A HUGE CHANGE IN OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WELL IF I IF IF I MIGHT. I THINK GOT FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM DO SUPPORT HOUSING CONSTRUCTION CERTAINLY. THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SUPPORTS HOUSING CONSTRUCTION I CAN TELL YOU THAT. AND. FOR RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS THAT I MONITOR VERY CLOSELY UMP SAN FRANCISCO SANTA MONICA WEST HOLLYWOOD LOS ANGELES. CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING. HAS CONTINUED APACE IN THESE COMMUNITIES WE VALUE HOUSING THE DEBATE IN THESE RENT CONTROL CITIES IS OVER HOW MUCH HOUSING NOT WHETHER TO BUILD HOUSING AND I WOULD DARE SAY THAT THESE COMMUNITIES OUT PACE. MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE NO RENT CONTROL JURISDICTION THERE'S YOU KNOW WE CAN. AUTHORIAL TERMS LIKE GUT NIMBY ISM ALL DAY LONG THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROTECTING. ARE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FROM EXORBITANT RENT INCREASES AND WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION THERE. DEBATE OVER HOW MUCH HOUSING TO BUILD IS A WELCOME DEBATE IN ANY COMMUNITY I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT ONE AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THEM A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND. WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT THE HOUSING PATRICK PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR A LOT OF THAT REALLY WE SAW REMOVING SOME OF THE CONTROL FROM LOCAL CONTROL WEEK WE BROUGHT A LOT OF THAT IT TO STAY CONTROL TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT AND. HELP WITH THE NIMBY ASPECT OF IT BUT YET WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD BE TURNING IT RIGHT BACK TO VERY LOCAL CONTROL AND PUTTING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY SO IT'S A WE'RE IN A BIT OF A CONFLICT HERE. NOW BUT YOUR POINT ABOUT TRYING TO BUY AYE A ASSEMBLYMEMBER I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CONFLICT IT HERE AT ALL I THINK THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT THE STATE STEP BACK AND SAY. WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A AYE STATEWIDE. APPLICATION OF LAW ON PARTICULAR ISSUES AND WE DID THAT. I KNOW THAT. THAT YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR ARE A BELIEVER IN LOCAL CONTROL AND I AGREE TO THAT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES ON WHICH A LITTLE MORE LOCAL CONTROL IS THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO GO THERE'S NO ONE SIZE THAT FITS ALL HERE. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY ALSO THAT. THAT. WHEN WHAT WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING SUPPLY THE ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY AND IF YOU LOOK AT MANY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING MY OWN. UNLESS WE ARE BUILDING DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE HOUSING THAT IS BEING BUILT TODAY IS UNAFFORDABLE TO EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS AND THAT ALSO IS THE ISSUE THAT. A TO ADDRESS HERE YES AND AND MISTER BLOOM YOU AND I ARE OF LIKE MIND ON A LOT OF THESE AND TOPICS WE ARE YOU KNOW WE JUST APPROACH FROM A LITTLE DIFFERENT ANGLES. BECAUSE I ALSO BELIEVE AND AND REALLY TRYING TO INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A LOT OF WAYS I BELIEVE WE CAN DO THAT IS BY MAKING MORE HOUSING AFFORDABLE. WHICH IS INCREASE THE OVERALL SUPPLY BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE. IT MY OPINION WE HAVE A LOT OF. WE WE HAVE A LOT OF A DEMAND AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF UNITS ARE COMING IN FOR FOR. WE YOU KNOW JOBS BUT NOT AS MANY UNITS FOR HOUSING AND SPECIALLY IN THESE URBAN AREAS OF THE COSTA COMMUNITIES THAT WE'VE BEEN REFERRING TO. SO BUT LET'S DON'T CHANGE THE TOPIC JUST A LITTLE BIT LET'S TALK ABOUT IN ITS IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE DO HAVE A RIGHT CONTROL. IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN RENT CONTROL UNITS DO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MAINTENANCE IN THE UPKEEP OF THE PROPERTIES. DOESN'T RENT CONTROL DISCOURAGE THE UPKEEP AND MODERNIZATION FRIENDLINESS LANDLORDS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE A RETURN ON THEIR INVESTORS MAY AGAIN I'M GONNA AS MEMBERS OF PUBLIC PLEASE. PLEASE. DO NOT EXPRESS BUCKLEY YOUR PROSPECTIVE AGAIN THE JAZZ HANDS ON THE THUMBS ARE FINE BUT. WE DON'T WANT. THAT THE CONVERSATION BE INTERRUPTED. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR I THINK GOD IS REAGANISM THE BEST POSITION ANSWERED THANK YOU I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S UP A LARGE MISCONCEPTION THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLD ABOUT RENT CONTROL I THINK ONE POINT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE. A THE CASE LAW REQUIRES THAT ANY RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE THAT'S IT THAT'S PASSED MUST GUARANTEE A PROPERTY OWNER A FAIR RETURN A FAIR AND REASONABLE RETURN. ON HIS OR HER INVESTMENT SO THAT IS WHY THIS ARGUMENT THAT IT DISINCENTIVE VISES CONSTRUCTION IS COULD COMPLETE RED HERRING BECAUSE CASE LAW PROHIBITS THAT. THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THE SAME GOES TO FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES. IF A IF A LANDLORD FINDS THAT HE OR SHE IS HAVING TO EXPEND CAPITAL. INVESTMENT IN A IN A MAIN THAT'S PROJECT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE. COME TO THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THOSE RENTING THOSE RENTAL RATES COULD BE INCREASED ON THAT BASIS SO ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE RAISING HAVE BEEN. I'M ALREADY ADDRESSED IN EITHER BY CASE LAW OR BY THE ORDINANCES UNDER WHICH THESE LAWS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED. I'M AND I JUST I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD JOBS THAT I SAT ON THE ON THE RENT BOARD IN IN OAKLAND. AND SO FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS LANDLORDS WERE ABLE TO COME AS AN AND PETITION TO GET RENT INCREASES FOR THOSE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THEY ALSO DURING THE DURING THE BIG DEBT CRISIS IN THE HOUSING CRISIS. I'M FACING THEIR LOANS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET INCREASES I MEAN INCREASES IN THEIR RENTS AND SPECIFICALLY APPLY FOR THOSE INCREASES. BUT TENANTS BECAUSE OF COSTA HAWKINS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET INCREASES SPECIFICALLY IN THE SITUATION WE HAVE NOW WITH THIS HOUSING SHORTAGE HOUSING CRISIS IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO LANDLORDS DOING THOSE FAULTY LOANS. BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND A LAW THAT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS WE CAN'T LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN'T. MEET THE NEED OF THEIR RESIDENTS TO KIND OF AUGMENT THE RED SPECIFICALLY IN A LOT OF IN IN THE BAY AREA COMMUNITIES BUT BASICALLY WHEN I WAS ON THE COUNCIL IN COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO BASIS SO IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ON THE LOCAL LEVELS SO THAT THEY CAN REALLY SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THIS IS A. IS A HISTORICAL MOMENT THAT WE'RE FACING IN CALIFORNIA. IF I COULD ASK FOR THE OPPOSITION TO RESPOND AS WELL PLEASE I THINK THE ONLY THING. WHAT I WOULD ADD IS WHEN YOU HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ONLY THAT ROLL BACK RENTS WHEN THEY WERE FIRST? ADOPTED SOME OF THE OWNERS NEVER CAUGHT UP BECAUSE TENNIS NEVER MOVED WITH THE VACANCY DE CONTROL THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER COSTA HAWKINS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE INCREASES IT ONLY ALLOWED UP TO SIXTY PERCENT OF THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT IS NOT IN FACT SOMETHING THAT HELPS THE LANDLORD. A RECOUP COSTS AND. EVEN THOUGH IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY WILL ALLOW YOU TO COME BEFORE OF THE RAM BORDEN ASK. FOR AN INCREASE IS NOT ALWAYS GRANTED TOWARDS GRANTED OVER THIRTY YEARS DEPENDING UPON WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO YOUR PROPERTY SO IT AGAIN IT'S NOT A SURE THING AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WITH. THE RENT CONTROL IN OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. OKAY AND THEN JUST MY FINAL QUESTIONS WITH THE CHAIRS. PERMISSION I JUST WANNA ASK. FOR RENT CONTROL AN OBJECT IS TO. IT IS IT MEANS TESTED. MEANS TESTING. NO LONGER. I WAS IS SHORT ANSWER IS NO IT'S NOT MEANS TESTING SOMETIMES THE INDUSTRY. HAVE PROPOSES THAT IT'S BEEN FLOATED AT DIFFERENT TIMES IT'S GENERALLY VIEWED WHEN YOU DIG INTO IT AS A SOLUTION LOOKING FOR A PROBLEM IN THAT TENANTS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY LOW IN MY. INCOME AND THOSE WHO ARE VERY HIGH INCOME GO OFTEN TEND TO GO OFF AND BUY PROPERTY. AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AROUND PRIVACY INVASION AND ALSO POTENTIAL DISCRIMINATION THAT ARE ONLY HIGHER INCOME TENANTS WHO WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL IN SOME WAY WOULD BE RENTED TOO SO THAT'S WHY. ADVOCATES GENERALLY ARE OPPOSED AND WHY NONE OF THE JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RENT CONTROL ALTHOUGH THEY'VE DISCUSSED THAT. OVER THE YEARS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY DIG INTO IT. USUALLY THE BETTER POLICY IT IS TO. IS TO NOT MEANS TESTED THERE'S CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THAT THAT JUST HAPPENS NATURALLY BASED ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WHO RENTS ASSAULTED SIMPLY SOMEONE MAKING MINIMUM WAGE WOULD HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO THE SAME UNIT AS SOMEONE MAKING A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. BUT ALSO IN A SITUATION AS MYSELF WHO SERVED AS YOU KNOW POLICY MAKER FOR THE STATE AND MY HUSBAND SERVED AS A VETERAN. YOU KNOW WHERE MIDDLE INCOME WE'RE DOING FINE YOU KNOW INCOME WISE YOU THINK BUT OUR LANDLORD RAISE OUR RENT BY FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS RENT A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH LIVE THERE FOR TEN YEARS. AND WE WERE FACED WITH SAYING DO WE HAVE TO MOVE OUR KIDS FROM THE HOME THAT THEY'VE LIVED IN THEIR WHOLE LIVES ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE. AWAY FROM GRANDPARENTS I MEAN IT ISN'T AN ISSUE OF LIKE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE OF CLASS IT'S AN ISSUE OF A HUMAN RIGHT IN TERMS OF A RIGHT TO STABILITY. AND SO THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER OR NOT I'M A MIDDLE CLASS PERSON WHETHER OR NOT I'M A POOR PERSON WHETHER NOT A RICH PERSON WHO HAS MILLION DOLLAR HOME. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE STABLE HOUSING AND THAT'S THAT GOES IN LINE WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO WE NEED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE NEED TO MAINTAIN STABILITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READY HOUSE. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T WE'RE GONNA JUST CABS CIRCULAR CONTINUOUS PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER STEINORTH MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU CHAIR. OBVIOUSLY HIGH COSTS OF OUR HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA IS A SERIOUS. TO THE LEVEL OF OF PRICES AND. HOT TOPIC AS A DEMONSTRATED UP. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM AND ALSO ON THE OR WEIGHS IN ON OUR SIDE. UNDERSTAND SEVERAL HUNDRED SO WHAT PEOPLE ARE ALL DAYER EITHER. IN SUPPORT WAR OPPOSITION. A LET ME EXPRESS MY VIEW. AND. ADD JUST SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS. BASICALLY. THAT IS SO AB FIFTEEN OR SIX IT IS OUR. TO REPEAL. R. COSTA HAWKINS SO. NOT RENTAL HOUSING ACT. YOU ARE NOT QUITE THE DIRECTLY SAYING THAT UP BUT THE. I DON'T FEEL. THAT THE REPEATING HIS TO ASK THE IS GONNA. TO SOLVE THE. SUCH A HIGH COST OF HOUSING. PROBLEMS. AND THE WE ARE DEBATING US OUT HERE WAS IN KHAN SO. IT WOULD HELP. ON THE OTHER HAND I SNUCK WILL NOT ACCEPT. IS NOT GONNA HELP X. IS GONNA EXACERBATE. OF THE SITUATION. FROM. THROUGHOUT THOSE STATE. THE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OUT WOULD INITIATE. YEAH FOR THE RENT CONTROL. WHERE? DO YOU THINK A MAYBE. ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM TEN ANSWERED THAT QUESTION. ON DO YOU BELIEVE. THIS TO REPEALING. THIS ACT DOT IS GONNA TRULY. ELIMINATE. OUR DOG GO CRISES SET IN THE PROBLEM WE ARE FACING. BEFORE YOU ANSWER THEM IN MY OBSERVATION IS NOT. UP BECAUSE OF AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL. NO CITIES I THINK OF. NEAR SOMEWHERE DOESN'T OFF FIFTEEN. A LOCALLY A S. ON A MONICA. LOS ANGELES. APOLLO ONTO A BEVERLY HILLS. AND SOME FRANCISCO PALM SPRINGS ISIS. SEVERAL OF THOSE CITIES AND NAMED THE WHO. I HAVE ADOPTED NO RENT CONTROL. ARE THE CITY'S. HAVE YOU CITIES SOLVE THE PROBLEM. HAVE YOU DONE ANY COMPARISON IS STUDIES. THAT THE THE. OUT MANNED SO. IN THE CITIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE AFFORDABLE. THEN THE OTHER CITIES SO THAT OUR. THAT HAVE NOT PUT UP DID. OF THE OUTRAGE CUANDO CONTROL MEASURES DUST SO BUMPY SECOND SECONDARY RUSSIA. AND ALSO. FURTHER. EXPANSION. OF Lú RENT CONTROL POSSIBILITY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. AND THE OR SO NOT ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION HOMES SO WHICH WERE EXAM. FROM RENT CONTROL. BY IDEAS SO A COSTA HAWKINS CBO. NOW WITH THE MANY NEW BUILDINGS ARE. R. WOULD BE SUBJECT TO. RENT CONTROL WORKS. SO. IT IS THAT IS SO GOOD IN INS INCENTIVE SO FOR. HOUSING CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES SO WOULD BE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BUILD THE MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES. AT WE HEARD CUSTOM PLY AND DEMAND THAT TO ME. OUR BASIC. THEORY OF THE ECONOMY AS A SUPPLY AND DEMAND. IF A SUPPLY IS. SUFFICIENT THAT THE PLANNING. THE COST OR QUOTA. AND THE WE ARE LIMITING THE CONSTRUCTION. WE ARE DE. INCENTIVIZING. DR CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO A FOOT OF BUILDING. AFFORDABLE HOMES. AND THAT THAT WOULD BE MAYBE THIRD. AND THE NORMAL FORCE THE QUESTION MIGHT BE. TAKEN THOSE. I HAVE ABOUT HALF. NOT TOO MANY. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. COMING UP. WHICH VIA OPPOSITE. PROVIDING INCENTIVES UP FOR CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BUILD MORE HOMES A SUCH AS SO REMOVING. SEEK HiA REQUIREMENTS CALIFORNIA IS SO NOTORIOUS. ARE ON THE REGULATION ITSELF FOR ANY BUSINESS BUT THEN PUT. IN HOUSING. OUR LAST TIME WHEN I HEARD GOV PROBABLY DON'T COSTS ARE. HAS GONE OUT THE WINDOW SO MAYOR OR PROCEDURE IRVINE. ONE YOU NEED JUST OUT TO GET. ARE PERMITTED ON ALL THE REQUIREMENTS. WE'RE COSTS UP THE PERMIT IS ARAFAT WILL COST A BEEN THERE. OF WHEN NOT A CONDOMINIUM UNIT OR DID FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND NOW WE WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE. EASING THOSE WHO REGULARLY R. EITHER A STATEWIDE. ONE LOCOG OF REGULATIONS TO. AYE IS. AND THE BILL THE MORE OF CONSTRUCTION SO THAT WAY OTHER BE MORE SUPPLIES AND THEN WHEN THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION. THE PEOPLE WOULD LOWER. THE COST OVER. HOSTING. BUT THE WE ARE RESTRICTING AND THE DISINCENTIVE ON SING AND DO YOU THINK GOD THIS IS SO RIGHT APPROACH FOR OVERALL. IS SOUNDS TONIGHT. LENDL'S SO INCREASE OUR OUR IS STILL PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IN HOUSING. BUT THE LAW TO ME COMMONSENSE TOPS ME ISN'T IT IS SO NOT THE ANSWER IS SO NOT THE PROBLEM IT HAS COSTA IS SOME MORE OFF OUR. SUPPLY AND WITHIN THE DEMAND AND THE DISINCENTIVE FIVE. INCENTIVIZING THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO APPEAR IN THE WAR HOUSING. SO WHY CAN WE WHY DON'T WE IN OUR ASK. NAY HOMES TO BE BUILT UP BY. ENCOURAGING THING ENCOURAGING THEM AND THEN ALSO REMOVING SO ALL THE HER DOING SO SUCH AS A SEQUEL AND THE ROLE LOCAL REGULATIONS. THAT'S MY LAST QUESTION. THANK YOU MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I MUST SAY I'M GRATEFUL THAT THERE WASN'T A NUMBER FIVE ON YOUR ON YOUR LIST. LET ME SEE IF I CAN WORK MY WAY UP THROUGH YOUR QUESTION SIR. ALL TRY TO DO IT IN ROUTE IN REVERSE ORDER BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH ASAP QUESTION YOU RAISE ABOUT SEQUEL AND FRANKLY I THINK. IT WOULD BE A GRAVE ERROR FOR US TO TURN THIS. HEARING INTO A DEBATE ABOUT SEAQUEST SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR DISCUSSION ON THAT ON THAT ISSUE. TO SOME DEGREE CERTAINLY YOU AND I AGREE THAT THERE IS A SUPPLY HOUSING SUPPLY ISSUE AND IN THE STATE. IN FACT THAT'S WHAT MUCH OF LAST YEAR'S HOUSING PACKAGE WAS ABOUT. ADDRESSING THAT SUPPLY ISSUE WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE ON THE SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS THAT WERE ENACTED INTO LAW LAST YEAR EVEN SOME OF THOSE HAT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE PROCESS. BUT I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ADDRESSING THAT VERY ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO REEMPHASIZE THAT. IF YOU AND I AND OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COME TOGETHER WITH EVEN MORE. WAYS OF PROVIDING FOR MORE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AS I BELIEVE WE SHOULD. BY THE TIME WE PASSED THOSE LAWS THOSE. AYE DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO BUILD COME UP WITH PLANS TO DO SO PUT IT THROUGH THE PROCESS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES BEGIN CONSTRUCTION AND ACTUALLY. HAVE THOSE UNITS COME ONLINE SEVERAL YEARS AT A MINIMUM ARE GOING TO PASS THE PIPELINE FOR CONSTRUCTING THOSE HOMES IS VERY LENGTHY. AS I TRIED TO ARTICULATE IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS. OF QUESTION THAT WE ARE PRESENTED WITH HERE TODAY IS WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHO TODAY. ARE BEING IMPACTED BY RENTS THAT ARE TOO DAMN HIGH THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD. AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION HERE TODAY BUT I RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES AND CONTINUE TO LEGISLATE. ON AT THE. A BILL SIGNING IN IN IN THE FALL THAT. R. CHAIR AND MANY OTHER MEMBERS. ATTENDED IN THE EYE AND I WAS THERE VIRTUALLY EVERY SPEAKER SAID WE HAVE BEGUN. THE WORK BUT THERE'S MUCH MUCH MORE TO DO SO I THINK WERE IN A COURT ON THAT. WITH RESPECT TO. THE WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES LOCAL GOVERNMENT THE ABILITY TO TAILOR SOLUTIONS TO THEIR OWN NEEDS AND SO YOU ARE GOING TO FIND IF THIS BILL. OF PASSES AND IS SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO DETERMINE WITH MORE WITH THEM MORE REFINED PAN. WHAT THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCES WILL DO THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT CREATES STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT? A THIS IS A BILL THAT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE FOR THEMSELVES AS THEY ARE THE CAN. ON WHAT ADDITIONAL OTHER ELEMENTS THAT WERE PROHIBITED BY COSTA HAWKINS WOULD NOW BE INCLUDED OR NOT INCLUDED IN THEIR LOCAL ORDINANCE. WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION. I I WANT TO REPEAT THAT A. THIS BILL IS ABOUT. PRESERVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OF WAITING DISPLACEMENT AND COMMUNITIES. WHAT IS RENT CONTROL DOING RIGHT NOW WITH COSTA HAWKINS? WE SEE IN VIRTUALLY EVERY RIGHT CONTROL JURISDICTION A DIMINUTION OF THE NUMBER AS RENTS GO UP AS UNITS TURN. AND. VACANCY DE CONTROL IS IMPLEMENTED WE SEE THE DELTA BETWEEN AFFORDABLE AND UNAFFORDABLE RANTS INCREASING RATHER THAN DECREASING. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM SO WE HAVE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE A DIMINISH NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A. AND FINALLY. ON THERE IS AND I THINK I'VE I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS BUT. COMEY TEAR OFF. YOUR FIRST QUESTION. ABOUT WHETHER. THIS BILL WILL ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM. A I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY ONE BILL THAT ELIMINATES THE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO LOOK ACROSS THE BOAR AT SOLUTIONS WE HAVE ALLOWED AND I WILL TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AS I THINK MANY OF US SHOULD WHO COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE ALLOWED FOR MANY YEARS TOOL AND AND AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ALLOW THIS PROBLEM TO GROW AND FASTER. SUCH THAT WE TOOK DAY HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS THAT IS SO DEEP AND SO WIDE THAT IT. DEMANDS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT ON THE PART OF ALL OF US TO SOLVE IT SO NO THIS. IS NOT GOING TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM IT IS GOING TO DRAMATICALLY HELP. LET ME ARE OF COURSE SO HERE FROM OPPOSITION ASIDE THOUGH WHAT DO YOU ALL FEEL BETTER CAR. IS SO TO MY COMMENTS AND CONCERNS SO ONE NIGHT TO THAT TO AND THE WRONG SO. MISTER BLOOM TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SO YOU ARE. NOT IN THE CONTROLLING OUR YOU KNOW ON PARTY. UP I WON US OVER THE PROBLEM IF I CAN BE HELP ON A SOME OF THE PROBLEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN. IN NOT SINGLE ASSOCIATED ALMOST SINGLE BR IS. WHEN I SOLVE THAT PROBLEM I REALIZED IT. BUT THAT IS TO SERIOUSNESS. I'M NOT OF INTEREST BY THE PUBLIC TO COME IN AND I FEEL LIKE A. THE ELIMINATION OF WITH THIS. YOU KNOW COSTA HAWKINS SAID IS GONNA SOLVE ENTIRE NO PROBLEM DUSTER IMPRESSION I GET THE PART I I WANT THE PUBLIC KNOW ABOUT IT. BUT THAT THERE ARE SO MANY. THE PROBLEM SET THAT THE WE FROM THIS. LEGISLATURE WE CREATE. NOT OF THINGS SO SUCH AS SOME MINIMUM WAGE. WE WE. ARE INCREASE AYE AND THE WORKERS SO. CERTAIN CRITERIA OF CONSTRUCTION NOT WORKERS TO WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID TO IN THE PREVAILING WAGE WHICH IS TO MUCH MUCH A HIGH YEAR. RATE THAN THE MARKET RATE. WE MEN DAY. THE DEVELOPERS SOUGHT TO TREAT THEIR. WORK US OUT TO BE SO CALLED THE FAIRLY PA. BY PREVAILING WAGE WHATEVER. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT THOSE THOSE ARE ADDING TO THE OHIO COST OF CONSTRUCTION. AND ARE IN THIS OUR CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY. NOBODY WOULD INVESTING MONEY. IF SO. THEY DON'T SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF UP GOOD TO RETURN. AND. COSTA BUILDING IS SO HIGH BUT THE RETURN NEWMAN OF CONTROLLING OR YOU CANNOT HAVE OUR OF FEAR AMONG OR PROFIT UP LIKE OF THE MIND. ARCH. TROLL. SO ARE. THIS IS A CONTRADICTING IT US AYE AYE STRUGGLE IN THIS OP DOC ARE SO SO CLEAN ACTIVELY HOME. EVEN THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ALL ON THE FLOOR OUT WE NOW ARE ADDRESS THAT. IS SO. ONE SIDE TO IS ARE LESS CONTROL LESS OR MORE AND SO ON AFFORD ONE THE OTHER HAND. WE WE ARE. BUT ENCOURAGE. WE ARE ADDING THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION SOCIAL CONTRADICTING HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT INDOSIAR REASSESS WHAT. I THINK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES EVERY DAY BUT I. WANT TO REMIND THAT. THE COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFULLY. OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT. WE ARE LOOKING AT. ONE BILL THAT ADDRESSES A DIFFERENT ISSUE FROM HOUSING SUPPLY. THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THIS IS A BILL THAT RESPONSE TO AN ISSUE. REGARDING WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES TODAY THAT FIXING THE SUPPLY IN THE FUTURE. OUT REALLY DOESN'T HELP REALLY DOESN'T SOLVE AND I THINK WE SHOULD REMAIN FOCUSED THEIR. BUT I WOULD I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THE YOU HAVE SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER SHORT OF OF COURSE AGREEING THAT THAT RENT CONTROL IS THE ANSWER I THINK. THOUGHTS HE EVER GETTING CLOSER I YOU KNOW I HAVE TO SAY. I'M MY BIGGEST FEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE KIDS IN COLLEGE AND I GET IT. IF WE IMPOSE RENT CONTROL. CITIES WILL DO IT FOREVER NO VACANCY THE CONTROL. RENTERS IN NEW YORK STILL PLAYING PAYING NINETEEN FORTY SEVEN RENTS AND WHEN MY KIDS COME INTO COLLEGE THEY WILL NOT FIND A PLACE TO LIVE. THEY JUST WON'T SO WE HAVE TO DO SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO PROMOTING HOUSING. THAT WE'VE WE SHRUNK OR OF COURSE OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO STAY IN PLACE THERE WILL BE NO PLACE FOR OUR NEW. EMPLOYEES TO LOOK THERE WILL BE NO PLACES FOR OUR KIDS COMING OUT OF COLLEGE TO LIVE. SO. I THINK RENT CONTROL UNFORTUNATELY WILL DISCOURAGE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION GOING FORWARD AND WE WILL REPEAT THAT I'M SORRY WILL REPEAT THAT AND I GET IT THAT RENT CONTROL WILL HELP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AT THIS MOMENT BUT IT WON'T STOP THERE. ANDTHAT'S THE MOST UNFORTUNATE PART OF THIS DEBATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NOW GO TO. MISTER BONTA. BUT FIRST I WANT I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR I'M. TO BLOOM FOR IT FOR YOU ADVOCACY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON BRINGING THE SOME IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR FOR THIS DISCUSSION. WHEN I THINK ART CHAIR OF OUR A HOUSING COMMITTEE. AS WELL FOR ALL THE GREAT THINGS YOU GOT DONE LAST YEAR. AND THEY CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR COULD YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING CRISIS IN STATE OF EMERGENCY WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK AND ALL THE WORK. A TO CONTINUE SO IS JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOU. I I'M A CO AUTHOR THIS BILL I'M GOING AYE TODAY AND I REALLY. APPRECIATE. A THIS CONVERSATION I UP AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT. YOU THIS IS THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE WHO TOOK TIME OUT YOUR BUSY DAYS FOR FOR FOR BEING HERE FOR IT FOR STEPPING UP AND STANDING UP IN. AND EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS AND A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO THE ALAMEDA WINTERS COALITION FOR FOR BEING HERE AND FOR AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT. YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY WE JUST ARE WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE TO. RECOGNIZE THE DEEP PAIN AND HURT AND HARM THAT OUR CURRENT CALIFORNIANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WHEN WERE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR IN A STATE OF CRISIS WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK WE NEED ALL TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. AND SO YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN STATED BUT I THINK IT BEARS RESTATING THAT. THIS BILL. WILL MANDATE. AND REQUIRE AND IMPLEMENT NOTHING IN THE FORM OF RENT CONTROL. IT WILL ALLOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE. THE. SOLUTIONS CAN BE CRAFTED ABOUT IT IN A WAY THAT FITS THAT THAT PROBLEMS AND AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE BEING FACED. AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT I THINK YOU KNOW THIS IS COSTA HAWKINS HAS BEEN. A STATEWIDE ONE SIZE FITS ALL BAR A PROHIBITION AND TODAY WE SIMPLY. ASK THAT WE REMOVE THAT BAR THAT WE LIFT THAT PROHIBITION THAT WE ALLOW FOR A CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE. AND THAT. LOCALS. WHO ARE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM WHO WHO SEE IT? IN IN IN THE FACES AND HERE IN THE WORDS OF THEIR CONSTITUENTS. AND THE RESIDENTS CAN CAN HELP ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. FAKE IT PROVIDES A TOOL A RESOURCE AN OPPORTUNITY SOME LOCALS WILL NOT NOT USE IT AT ALL. SOME WILL. AND AND. I TRUST THAT DURING THAT PROCESS. ALL SIDES THE TAPE WILL BE INVITED TO TO. UP PARTICIPATE NOT CONVERSATION THAT SOME OF THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. CERTAIN SOME AN ATTACK WHAT CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE BEEN. RAISED AROUND SUPPLY SIDE. PROVIDING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHAT WILL BE ADDRESSED AND AND AND CAN BE. IN AND A SOLUTION CAN BE CRAFTED THAT THAT MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TO HAVE ROBUST SUPPLYING CALIFORNIA THAT THE WORK THAT WE STARTED LAST YEAR CONTINUES. AND. WHILE THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED THE FUTURE IS A TIME HORIZON FOR THESE NEW UNITS TO BE. BROUGHT ONLINE THAT TENANTS WHO ARE HURTING NOW. WHO NEED HELP NOW? I WILL BE PROTECTED AND AND SUPPORTED. SO YOU KNOW I. I I THINK WE OUGHT NOT. DEPRIVE OUR LOCAL LEADERS OF OF A TOOL. THAT THEY CAN USE TO PROTECT THEIR TENANTS. AN AND CALIFORNIANS IN IN IN THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK. THAT IT'S. NOT PRUDENT TO PRE DECIDE THIS ISSUE. AND TO REMOVE THIS POTENTIAL TOOL UP FROM EVEN BEING CONSIDERED AYE I THINK WE NEED IT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AND I AND I THINK. THAT CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE IT THAT THAT TENANTS DESERVE IT THAT IT'S IT'S PART OF OUR ONGOING EFFORT TO STAND UP FOR. AND PROTECT AND DEFEND AYE CALIFORNIANS WHO WHO WERE AYE FACING CHALLENGES IN WHO ARE WHO ARE HURTING. AND THAT'S OUR JOB THAT'S WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES IT IT PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS FACING CALIFORNIANS AND AND THIS. IS I'M NOT JUST A PROBLEM EXISTED EMERGENCY IN A CRISIS GIVEN OPPORTUNITY ACTIVATE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE'VE AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE LIVES. OF CALIFORNIANS AND A PROVIDE A TOOL TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT CAN THAT CAN REALLY HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE SO I I AM PROUD.

MISTER CHU YOU AYE EACH YEAR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN. ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING AND AND AND IT CONTINUES AND. NOTE TODAY THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE I'M IN A VOTE I AND I ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THE SAME THANK YOU. THING IS A BONTA MISTER CHAPMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WANT US ON THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAVE TRAVEL FROM A FAR. LET ME START OFF BY ECHOING SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ALREADY. THAT THE WE'D THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT WE NEED ABOUT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW UNITS EVERY YEAR JUST TO MEET THE DEMANDS. THAT WE FACE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT THE RENTS HERE IN THE STATE. ARE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL ON IN FACT THE AVERAGE SHELL AMOUNT RENT. ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES A. OTHER DEPARTMENT OF URBAN HOUSING. IS AROUND THIRTEEN HUNDRED. DOLLARS A MONTH. AND THAT IS THE SECOND HIGHEST IN THE NATION. AND AS WE HEARD FROM THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR IN. A MANY OF YOU EARLIER. YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE IMPACTS OF THESE. PHENOMENA ARE HAVING. ON THE RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. WHICH IS ALSO A REASON WHY IN THE PAST LEGISLATORS CYCLE WE PASSED A TOTAL OF FIFTEEN HOUSING BILLS AS MISSION. EARLIER. AND BUT AWARENESS PUT ALL FIFTEEN OF THEM. OUR. IT WAS. NEVERTHELESS JUST ONE STEP TOWARDS. THESE VERY PRESSING ISSUES THAT WE FACE. WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS AS WE GO. TRUE QUESTION BECOMES WHETHER EXPANDING RENT CONTROL IN THE STATE IS YET ANOTHER SOLUTION. I MUST ADMIT THAT TOPPING THE RENT IN SOME SITUATIONS MAY APPEAR. TO CONTROL THE UPTAKE IN RAN. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. YET IN THE LONG RUN. I WE SOLVING THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT WAS BEEN RACED. I MEAN FIRST OF ALL POINT TO THE VERY RECENT STUDY IN THAT'S THE TWENTY SIXTEEN STUDY THAT WAS. ARE DISCUSSED EARLIER BY THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. WHICH IS A NONPARTISAN NON BIASED ANTI THAT WE. IN FACT OFTEN LOOK TO THAT I OFTEN LOOK TO. THEIR CONCLUSION. AS LATE AS TWENTY SIXTEEN. WAS THAT RIGHT CONTROL IS NOT LETME UNDERSCORE IS NOT A VEHICLE. TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. NOW SOME OF ITS FINDINGS IN FACT COINCIDE WITH MANY OF THE STUDIES OUT THERE CONDUCTED BY ECONOMISTS I THINK WE TALK ABOUT ECONOMIST EARLIER. WHICH INDICATES SAID EXPANDING NOW EXPANDING RANKED ROLE. HOOKS ACTUALLY EXACERBATE THE HOUSING SITUATION. THIS INCENTIVIZE NEW CONSTRUCTION. BECAUSE DILAPIDATED HOUSING CONDITIONS BE DUE TO LACK OF MAINTENANCE. AND MAY EVEN DISCOURAGE HOUSEHOLDS FROM MOVING. TO MARKET RATE HOUSING WHERE IT MAY OTHERWISE BENEFIT THEM. IN FACT THE LA ILL ALSO SAYS THAT MARKET RATE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED. ASSOCIATED WITH LESS LESS DISPLACEMENT. REGARDLESS OF THE COMMUNITIES INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICY. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT ALSO DISPLACEMENT. NOW. AS WE ALL KNOW ON THE CURRENT LAW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED. CITIES ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ADOPT RENT CONTROL. YES. UNDER THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY CITIES HERE IN THE STATE OF CAIFORNIA. ONLY FIFTEEN OF THEM FIFTEEN. HAVE RENT CONTROL AND THAT'S LIKE THREE PERCENT. LIFTING COSTA HAWKINS MAY INDEED HELP SOME CITIES AND SOME RESIDENTS. BUT IT MAY ALSO HURT OTHERS AT THE SAME TIME. JUST YESTERDAY AYE I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD. CONSTITUENTS WHO RAISED TWO CHILDREN AS A SINGLE MOTHER. WHO REALIZE ON INCOME FROM A VERY SMALL INVESTMENT PROPERTY? AS HER LIVELIHOOD. SHE SAID THAT SHE NEEDS THE ABILITY TO CHARGE MARKET RATE. AGAIN MARKET RATE. TO PAY FOR. HER MORTGAGES HER INSURANCE THE PROPERTY TAX UTILITIES IMPROVEMENTS AND REPAIRS JUST TO KEEP. THE RENTAL PROPERTY. ALSO SHE DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY RETIREMENT BENEFITS BENEFITS FROM HER DECEASED HUSBAND. BUT THIS BILL WILL COMPLETELY CHANGE THAT. AND SHE'S ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES IN MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE CONSIDER ALL ASPECTS WHEN WE PASS A LAW. I THINK THAT A COMPLETE REPEAL A COMPLETE REPEAL OF A TWENTY YEAR. OLD LAW. MAY HAVE IN FACT SOME ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE OVERALL HOUSING SITUATION AND ON THE VERY RESIDENTS THAT THE LAW IS INTENDED. TO BENEFIT. NO I WAS OPEN AND I HAVE BEEN OPEN. TO MEETING INCREMENTAL CHANGES. TO THE EXISTING LAW. NAMELY COSTA HAWKINS. AND AS WE KNOW THE LAW HS THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS. SINGLE FAMILY HOMES THEY CONCEDED CONTROL. AND NEW BUILDINGS ARE NEW HOMES. AND WAS OPEN TO BASICALLY TWEAKING ANY PART OF THAT. WE CAN ALSO DO A PILOT PROJECT FOR CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS. YET. IT UP IT'S A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR THAT NEAR SIGH. HAVE MADE ANY CONCESSIONS AND PRINTS AND THEREFORE THE LAST YEAR. SO PLEASE SAID A COMPLETE REPEAL WITHOUT A REPLACEMENT A BACK UP PLAN IS JUST TOO RISKY. ON MY BOOKS. SO I'M JUST GOING. JOHN GOOD ABSTAINED FROM VOTING TODAY. I DO WANT ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR IN. MANY OF YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. TRY TO FIND WAYS TO REFORM COSTA HAWKINS. THANK WAS CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AYE KNOW WE WANNA GET PUBLIC COMMENT. AND LESSER ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OF I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BUT A DOCTOR WOULD. YEAH I THOUGHT WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS AND MAKING COMMENTS O SO KATE MAKE COMMENTS THE IT IS ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PUBLICCOMMENT DOESN'T HAVE DISCUSSION AFTER PUBLICLY SO WE WILL HAVE TO. IT'S GOT ABSOLUTELY. AND THEN I WILL HOLD MY COMMENTS OKAY GREAT. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL THE MEMBERS THE PUBLIC FOR THE DISCUSSION I WANT TO THANK THE WITNESSES AS WELL AS OF THE BILL AUTHORED THIS HAS BEEN A A DIFFICULT DISCUSSION. OF IT AND LET ME SAY I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS WHERE MY PERSPECTIVE IS AS I SAID EARLIER I AM A CO AUTHOR OF OF THIS BILL. I WANT TO HE APPRECIATE THAT THE THAT. THE ISSUES AND BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND OBVIOUSLY. WE DON'T HAVE AGREEMENT ON ON ON ON SOME OF THAT AND AND THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSION AROUND WHETHER THIS WILL. A REPEAL EXCLUDE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND I WOULD JUST NOTICE WAS SAID BEFORE JUST IN THE BAY AREA. OUT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS HALF OF NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE IN RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS EVEN THOUGH THOSE RENT CONTROLLED RESTRICTIONS ONLY. OCCUPY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF LAND IN THE BAY AREA WHILE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN THE BAY AREA THAT DO NOT HAVE RENT CONTROL. HAVE SEEN ZERO CONSTRUCT AND AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO GRAPPLE WITH. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION AROUND. ACANCY DE CONTROL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WHEN. RENT CONTROL. WAS BEING DEBATED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND EARLY EIGHTIES. SOME OF THE CITIES DECIDED TO MOVE FOR THE VACANCY TO CONTROL MANY DID NOT. ARE AND THOSE THAT DID. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY JUST FOR EXAMPLE IN SANTA MONICA UP WHEN VACANCY DE CONTROL WAS IMPOSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE WITH COSTA HAWKINS. YOU SAW AFFORDABILITY IN CITIES LIKE SANTA MONICA GO FROM. EIGHTY THREE PERCENT DOWN TO FOUR PERCENT ONE VACANCY DE CONTROL CAME AND SO AGAIN IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. I DO HAVE REALLY TWO QUESTIONS TO THE OPPOSITION. I THINK WE ALL AGREE AS MS CARLTON AND MY COLLEAGUE MISTER BLOOM UPSET WE ALL AGREE WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. IF WE HAD MORE HOUSING TODAY. IF RENTS WERE STABLE WE WOULD NOT HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BUT AS MISTER BLOOM POINTED OUT. ON EVEN IF WE DO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO FROM LAST YEAR THIS YEAR BEYOND. OUR TO ENSURE MORE HOUSING IT WILL TAKE YEARS. TO PUT HOUSING. ON THE GROUND TO HAVE IT BUILT TO HAVE FOLKS HOUSE. AND SO WE HAVE A CRISIS TO DAY. WE'VE A CRISIS OF NOW. WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED AND WHO WERE BEING EVICTED AND THEY ARE OUR NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR FAMILIES THEY ARE FOLKS WHO ARE HERE IN THIS ROOM. AND AND WITH THE URGENCY OF NOW. MY QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION IS IF NOT THIS. WHAT WOULD YOU PROPOSE TO DAY THAT WE COULD GET DONE TODAY TO PREVENT? THOUSANDS OF TENANTS FROM BEING EVICTED. MILLIONS A CALIFORNIANS FOM BEING. HOUSING UNSTABLE. THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION. IN YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S FASCINATING IS IS WE HAVEN'T SAT DOWN TO TALK ABOUT A COMPROMISE. AND I THINK THE MOST MOST UNFORTUNATE PART IS THAT WE'VE BEEN THREATENED WITH AN INITIATIVE RIGHT. ONE OF THE PROPONENTS THERE HAS BEEN A PROPONENT OF STOPPING ALL CONSTRUCTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AMOUNT OF LOS ANGELES. IT'S TRUE AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT I THINK. WE ARE NOT. OPPOSED TO TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT ON THE TABLE AGAIN THREATENING US A LOOMING IS AN INITIATIVE AND THAT JUST ANYTHING WE DO HERE THE LEGISLATURE. WILL BE OVER RIDDEN POTENTIALLY. BY A STATE INITIATIVE OF COURSE EVERYBODY'S GONNA THROW MILLIONS pOF DOLLARS AND SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND INITIATIVE AND THAT'S VERYUNFORTUNATE. SO I WOULD SAY WE ARE NOTADVERSE TO TALKING ABOUT COMPROMISES AND WE STAND READY TO SIT AT THE TABLE AND TALK. BUT AT THIS POINT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SAY ANYTHING PUBLICLY ABOUT IDEAS I COULD ADDRESS THE EVICTION COARSER SENATE DEMOCRATS AS WELL. AYE I'M TRULY JUST ASKING THE QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE'VE COLLEAGUES LIKE MR CHOW YEAH WHO AND PROBABLY OTHERS THAT WOULD BE WILLING. TO CONSIDER COSTA HAWKINS REFORM IF THEIR IDEAS ON THE TABLE BUT AT THIS MOMENT THERE ARE NO AND THAT IS ENTERED IT I GET IT AND THAT'S FAIR IN FACT. LAST YEAR WE COMPROMISED. ON INCLUSIONARY ZONING SO WE HAVE. CLEARED IT UP THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COULD ALLOW FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OF ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION. THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE COMPROMISE THAT WE DID LAST YEAR. AND I. I I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS. NEW CONSTRUCTION. RENT CONTROL. SO MEASURES LIKE THAT ARE CERTAINLY SOMETHING AGAIN THAT WE STAND READY TO TALK ABOUT. AND THEN ONE AND THIS IS A BIT MORE OF A DETAILED QUESTION BUT ONE ASPECT OF OF COSTA HAWKINS THAT I HAVE HAD. SERIOUS ISSUES WITH OVER THE YEARS IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S A A DATE LIMITTION. ARE AFTER WHICH NEW CONSTRUCTION CANNOT HAVE RENT CONTROL APPLY TO IT SO ARE AS OF NINETEEN NINETY FIVE ALL LAWS THAT HAD BEEN ON THE BOOKS SO FOR EXAMPLE MY CITY IN NINETEEN OF THE NINE OR MANY OTHERS IN. OF THE LATE SEVENTIES TO THE EARLY EIGHTIES NO NEW CONSTRUCTION AFTER SAY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IN SAN FRANCISCO COULD HAVE WRECKAGE APPLY TO IT. WE ARE NOW MOST FORTY YEARS FROM THAT AND THAT IS MEANT FORTY YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION AND SAN FRANCISCO AND AGAIN YOU CAN. PICK YOUR CITY AND ONE RANKING JEWEL MIGHT OF APPLIED. ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO RENT CONTROL. WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT MY? TODDLER WHO'S ALMOST TWO YEARS OLD BY THE TIME HE IS AN ADULT SEEN AS THIRTIES. WE COULD SEE RENT CONTROL STARK. DWINDLE BE DEMOLISHED AND EFFECTIVELY AND AND AND AND AT SOME POINT RANK CONTROL IF IF COSTA HAWKINS DOESN'T CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. THE WRECKAGE WAS TALKING CALIFORNIA WILL DISAPPEAR. I AND IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THAT IS WHERE WHAT YOU SUPPORT THAT RENT CONTROL IN ALL THE CITIES IT EVEN CURRENTLY HAVE A CONTROL. THAT THAT RENT CONTROL STOCK SHOULD SHOULD NO LONGER EXIST. WE A RIGHT I DON'T THINK WE WANT OUR KIDS MOVING BACK HOME WITH US DO WE AND I THINK THAT'S ONE HUNDRED CHALLENGES E WANT THEM TO HAVE A LIFE. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO THOSE PROVIDE ASSURANCES. FOR THOSE A NEW CONSTRUCTION WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHEN YOU CONSTANTLY CHANGE THE DATE. WE'VE GOTTA FIND A WAY TO PROVIDE SOME ASSURANCES. FOR THOSE WHO ARE BUILDING NEW HOUSING IF WE JUST LEAVE IT WIDE OPEN. A FOR EVERY JOB LOCAL JURISDICTION TO MAKE THEIR OWN CALL ON WHETHER IT'S BELOW. CP I THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THAT DOESN'T HELP. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW. WHERE IS THE POINT AT WHICH WE WILL STOP AND WILL WE CONTINUALLY MOVE THAT MARKER? IF WE COULD FIND A WAY TO SAY WHAT THAT MEANS I THINK THAT WOULD HELP AND IT WOULD HELP WITH NEW CONSTRUCTION SO WHILE THAT'S NOT A FIRM ANSWER. I THINK WHAT IT IS IS A WAY FOR US TO COME TO THE TABLE TO TALK. THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT. IT MISTER BLOOM D. OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU WANNA MAKE AN OTHERWISE OR THE PUBLIC AREA I'LL JUST A RESPOND BRIEFLY TO OF THE LAST FEW COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD AND AND EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION AND. TO THE OPENING CA. THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM OPPOSITION TO HAVE A DIALOGUE AND DISCUSS COMPROMISE SOME CERTAINLY. CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT AND IT. FURTHER TO THE POINT. AYE AYE CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER TRY TO SPEAK UP FOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAO. BUT. AYE I HEAR HIS COMMENTS AND I SEE THEM MORE AS AN ADMONITION THAN A SUGGESTION A REQUEST. THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A AT ALTERNATIVES I WOULD. POINT OUT ONE OTHER THE OTHER THING AND THAT IS SO. THAT WE ARE. FACED WITH CERTAIN FACTS WITH RESPECT TO THE. ASSEMBLY. OF LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE THAT PUTS. ANY DISCUSSION OF A COMPROMISE WHETHER THIS AND AND AND OTHER FACTS EXTERNAL TO OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT REALLY DEMAND THAT WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. HERE AND NOW AND SO I WANT TO JUST SAY FOR THE RECORD HERE. REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME HERE TODAY I THINK THERE'S GOOD REASON FOR US TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. I'D CERTAINLY. OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THISBILL MOVE FORWARD SO THAT THE. BILL COULD COME TO THE FLOOR AND HAVE A BROADER DEBATE THERE WOULD BE DISCUSSION BETWEEN NOW AND THEN IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN. BUT. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY GOOD THAT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT. HE'D ON US AND LOW PRESSURE ON TO FIND THE RIGHT SOLUTION. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WHETHER REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME I JUST WANNA SAY I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU MR BLOOMIN AND WITHOUT AND LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS FOR THIS STAGE OF THE HEARING. ARM AS I STATED AT THE OUTSET NAM I WANT TO WE WERE GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. IGHT AT THIS MOMENT I WANNA FIRST GIVE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WISH TO. STAND OF THE VERY LONG LINE OF THE OPTION TO RAISE YOUR HANDS TO INDICATE IF YOU ARE AND SUPPORTER OPPOSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT.

AT THIS TIME PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED MATTER IS BACK IN THE HANDS OF THE COMMITTEE ALLOWS THE. SURGEONS TO CALL THE ABSENT MEMBERS BACK FOR DISCUSSION. OUR COLLEAGUES. DISCUSSION. COMMENTS QUESTIONS. MR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM. I AM VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S LONG PAST TIME. THAT WE TAKE THE HANDCUFFS OFF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO DO THE APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS NECESSARY TO LOOK AT AT WHAT HOW WHEN. TO DEAL WITH WITH RENT CONTROL IN THEIR OWN JURISDICTIONS AGREE THAT THIS IS JUST A A TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE. ENSURING THAT WE'RE HANDING AS MANY TOOLS AS POSSIBLE DOWN TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DO WHAT THEY WHAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO DO. OF I'M ALSO A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED SINCE I HEAR SO MUCH FROM THE OPPOSITION AND OTHERS THAT THERE ARE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS HERETHERE ARE WAYS TO LOOK AT COSTA HAWKINS AND. AND MAY BE SIX INCUMBENT AMENDMENT RATHER THAN JUST AN APPEAL. THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED ELEVEN MONTHS AGO AND I I KNOW YOU VERY WELL MISTER BLOOM I KNOW YOUR DOORS OPEN AND THAT YOUR. VERY ACCESSIBLE TO HAVING CONVERSATIONS AROUND IT IN AND WHY WE HAVE TO WAIT. THIS LONG TO HAVE THAT NOTION BROUGHT FORWARD IS IS A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING AND SO FOR I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME CONCERN. AND SOME SOME INTEREST AMONG MEMBERS HERE IN LOOKING AT SOME OTHER WAY OF APPROACHING IT AND MAY BE MODIFIED COSTA HAWKINS OUTSIDE THE ONLY WAY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN IS FOR US TO PASS THIS BILL HERE TODAY. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T ALL THIS THE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING TO STOP. HOW SUPPORT AN ABSOLUTE REPEAL ANYWAY BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN? KING THAT EXTRA STEP AND CONTINUING TO TALK THEN THAT'S I THINK VERY LAUDABLE IN IN ORDER TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION A POLICY MOVING FORWARD BUT THE ONLY WAY WE MOVE IT FORWARD TODAY IS TO PASS IT OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE SO I ASK ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. TO SUPPORT. THIS BILL TODAY THIS EFFORT AND EVEN IF IT IS FOR YOU AN INTERIM STEP. THAT'S FINE BY NICK REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS IS AN APPROPRIATE. STEP FOR CALIFORNIA THIS TIME TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER STONE. OTHER COMMENTS MISTER STEINORTH. I HAVE A QUESTION AND I HAVE A STATEMENT YOU WHEN MY MISTER BLOOM FIRST THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTING THIS TODAY. I'M YOU SAY YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR LOCAL CONTROL ON THAT THIS BILL ESSENTIALLY DOES ACT LOOK WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE CITIES AND ALSO SEES ACT. I'M NOT CERTAIN. OKAY BECAUSE I I MEAN THEY'RE THE CHAMPIONS OF LOCAL CONTROL. THE NO POSITION AS FAR NO MUSICIAN VERY GOOD. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE SERGEANTS FOR DOING AN ADMIRABLE PROFESSIONAL JOB IN AND MANAGING PUBLIC TESTIMONY TODAY I THINK WE ALL WILL AGREE THAT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. OPINIONS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE AND I THINK THIS ARTIST OF DONE AT A GREAT JOB IN KEEPING THAT. MOVING FORWARD AND I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR ALSO FOR BRING THIS FORWARD IT'S IT'S A LOT OF WORK IT'S HEAVY LIFTING I UNDERSTAND. THEY CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THIS AND AND TO BOTH THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS FOR MAKING VERY GOOD ARGUMENTS. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY THOUGH I BELIEVE TO RECONCILE COULD BE THE TIPPING POINT CALIFORNIA. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT THE SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS IS INCREASING THE SUPPLY OF HOMES. REPEALING COSTA HAWKINS DOES NOT SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. IT POTENTIALLY COULD EXACERBATE IT. AGAIN I ASK EVERYONE TO PLEASE IF YOU NEED TO TALK. TAKE IT OUTSIDE MR STEINORTH THANK YOU. AND IT HURTS SMALL PROPERTY OWNERS THE MOST BY EXTENDING RENT CONTROL THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS AND ALLOWING RENT CONTROL ANY UNIT FOR LIFE WITH ONLY MINOR INCREASES. THIS WILL HURT SMALL OWNERS IS THE MAJORITY OF THE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS ARE OWNED BY INDIVIDUALS NOT BIG CORPORATIONS. THERE ARE A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND SINGLE FAMILY RENTALS. NOW I APPRECIATE AGAIN THE AUTHORS OF PROPONENTS INTENTIONS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE AND SAFE OUT OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA BUT I'M. I'M CONFIDENT THAT AB FIFTEEN NO SIX WILL DO THE. OPPOSITE OF THE DESIRED GOALS I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS MISTER DOCTOR WHAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE IT THE AUTHOR FOR THIS WORK ON THIS I BELIEVE WHICH IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED TOPIC. WE'RE FACING A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABSOLUTE NOTE ABOUT NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. MAJORITY RATHER SPEND MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT COSTS AND THAT'S CLEARLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. BUT I TO BELIEVE THE ROUTE CRISIS BECAUSE OF THIS CRISIS OUR FAILURE TO BUILD ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND KEEP UP WITH OUR GROWING POPULATION. WE TOOK STEPS LAST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE HURDLES THAT CREATED THIS DYNAMIC BUT WE'RE STILL VERY FAR BEHIND. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S AT COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE REDEVELOPMENT SOLELY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GET BACK TO WHERE WE WERE. IN MY COMMUNITY THE LAST AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WAS BUILT WHEN WE HAD DEVELOPED HAD REDEVELOPMENT WE DON'T HAVE THAT CRITICAL RESOURCE NOW AND I THINK IT'S REALLY HURT US. AND HURT PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. PRIOR TO THE WILDFIRES INCIDENTS NUMBER COUNTY. AND MENDOCINO COUNTY. R. VACANCY RATE IN BOTH COUNTIES WAS ABOUT OR LESS THAN TEN TWO PERCENT. AND THIS IS ONLY WORSENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER. FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED HOMES THAT NEED TO BE REBUILT IN MY TO COUNTIES. AND MANY OF THESE SERVE OUR MULTI FAMILY HOMES. AND I I SUPPORT BECAUSE I THE MEASURES TO CONTAIN RISING COSTS. BUT I'M NOT CONFIDENT CAUGHT A COTTON QUITE CONFIDENT. THAT A COMPLETE REPEAL OF COSTA HAWKINS IS THE ANSWER. IN MY DEBT DISTRICT WERE DEDICATED TO REBUILDING. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO FACILITATE AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF HOUSING IN ME MAY TH AND MAY IN FACT. HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT BY DISCOURAGING NEW CONSTRUCTION DURING A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST. WITH RESPECT TO THE AUTHOR I THINK THE MESSAGE FROM ADVOCATES AS THIS IS A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT APPROACH. THAT IS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN MY OPINION DOES NOT RESULT NECESSARILY A GOOD POLICY. WELL I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE ISSUE OF RISING RENTS AND ITS IMPACT ON PEOPLE. AMONG ABLE TO SUPPORT A PRO PROPOSAL THAT IS REPRESENTED IS ONE THAT NEEDS NO FURTHER WORK MODIFICATION A COMPROMISE AND FOR THAT REASON. I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. OTHER. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AGAIN. OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. IT'S ABOUT A. I'M MISTER BUT MY I DIDN'T MAKE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS THAT MAY OF GOTTEN LOSSES IN IN THE US SOME OF THE DISCUSSION IN AND APPRECIATE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO. CAME HERE IS STILL HERE WHO STOOD UP TO SPEAK OF TO COMMENT YOU'RE BUSY DAY. TO SHARE WITH US YOUR INPUT I'M IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED HELP MAKE TODAY'S THAT DISCUSSION MORE ROBUST AND MORE RICH. MR BOMBS NOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS DO. DO CITIES. OR COUNTIES. FOR IT LOCAL LEADERS WHO DO NOT WISH. TO. CHANGE OUT. THAT THE CURRENT STATUS OF. SINGLE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS BEING EXEMPT. THE RULES UNDER CONSTRUCTION THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS WITH THE BAR. AND AND DON'T WISH TO CHANGE VACANCY HE CONTROLLED IT WOULD WHAT PAKPATTAN AB FIFTY NO SIX. REQUIRE THAT THEY DO THAT. NO. AND AND FOR THOSE WHO DO WISH TO BECAUSE. THEY BELIEVE IT'LL SOLVE A PROBLEM IN THEIR IN THEIR CITY OR THEIR LOCALITY. DO THEY HAVE TO. TO. ADOPT ALL COMPONENTS OF. REPEAL OF EVERY ONE OF THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT IS CURRENTLY COSTA HAWKINS TOUCHES KNOW ME THEY COULD THEY COULD TAKE SOME OF THE COULD LEAVE SOME RIGHT. THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA AND THEY COULD ARM PROVIDE. A SET OF NUANCE TO. THE SOME OF THE COMPONENTS FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT ROLLING DEFINITION OF WHAT NEW CONSTRUCTION HAS. SO THAT IT'S NOT STUCK IN IN IN IN CEMENT AT A MOMENT IN TIME AND A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW. SOMETHING BUILT AFTER NINETEEN NINETY FIVE IS STILL CONSIDERED NEW CONSTRUCTION ONE IT'S NOT. AND IF YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A A REASONABLE. PERIOD OF TIME FOR RETURN ON INVESTMENT I MEAN ALL ALL THAT CAN BE PART OF THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WOULD GO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT THAT'S CORRECT. AND MOM AND POPS IF A LOCAL DISTRICT JURISDICTION CHOSE TO DO THEY CAN BE EXEMPTED. AND AND FOCUS COULD BE PUT ON WALL STREET ARE CORPORATIONS WITH INVESTOR OWNED SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND CONDOS CORRECT TRIP. TO OFFICE OKAY SO I MEAN IT. THE POINT HERE IS THAT THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES. FROM DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. TO. I'M TAKING A AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGES IN ALL THREE OF THE LOWER LEGS OF THE THREE LEGGED STOOL R. COSTA HAWKINS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN. CAN. CRAFT. A TAILORED SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM FITS IN THEIR IN THEIR JURISDICTION RIGHT YES. AND AND IF THE BABY FIFTY NO SIX DOESN'T PASSED TODAY. I'M WE KNOW THIS DISCUSSIONS CANNOT CONTINUE I I APPRECIATE THE. ITEM OVERTURES THAT WERE MADE THAT THAT THE COMMITMENTS TO ONGOING DISCUSSION BUT. IF AB FIFTY KNOWS IT DOES MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY. THE NUMBER TIME FOR FOR THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND. AT I AGREE THAT THERE ARE ARE ARE MANY FACETS TO THE DISCUSSION ON THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPINIONS. BUT THE DISCUSSION HAS IS ABSOLUTE IMPORTANT AND NEEDS TO CONTINUE IT MUST CONTINUE I DO IF. I DO SUPPORT FULL REPEAL COSTA HAWKINS AND I CERTAINLY SUPPORT. OUR CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION AS WE GO FOR THIS IS THE FIRST HOUSE THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE. THEY WILL BE OUT MUCH MORE OPPORTUNITY TO. UNRAVEL SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED TODAY TO DISCUSS THEM TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND CREEK FIXES THAT WORK FOR FOLKS. TOM BUT THE BOTTOM LINE CONTINUES TO BE. THAT. CALIFORNIANS. AND DESERVE. FOR US TO DELIVER TO THEM SOME EASEMENT OF OF THEIR PAIN. OF THEIR SUFFERING OF THEIR ANGUISH OF THEIR HURT AND WEAVING OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT TODAY. UP SO I WILL BE PART I WILL BE A VOTE FOR IT FOR THAT. AND STANDING UP FOR CALIFORNIANS IN AND PROVIDING A RELIEF TO THEM. AND I HOPE THIS DISCUSSION CAN CONTINUE AND AGAIN APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP MISTER BLOOM. AYE AS WELL AS YOURS I'M MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. DISCUSSION. MISTER CHOI. I CHAIRMAN I AM CURIOUS WHETHER ANYBODY HAS TAKEN TO TALLIES OF. UP PUBLIC SUPPORT IN THE POLLS. THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF ATTEMPTS TO BUT THEY HAVE AN ADDED UP ALL THE HASH MARKS YET SO WE'LL WE'LL TRY TO DO THAT LATER ON. THERE'S NO WHICH IS THE VISUAL OR. WITHOUT ACTUALLY COUNTY IT'S ACTUALLY FROM WHAT WE CAN. IT FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE CLOSE. SO THAT'S. OKAY I. IT IS WHAT IT IS. I YEAH I ACT I CAN I CAN TELL QUITE. SUPPORT AND GLOW. OPPOSE. NECK AND NECK. IS SOMEBODY HAS SWELLED COUNTER. I APPRECIATE THE WITH THE PUBLIC FOR COMING OUT AND EXPRESSING I THINK. WE ARE TRULY. WITNESSING A DEMOCRACY. AT WORK A. IS A VERY. R. DIFFICULT FOR US SO WE OR INDIVIDUAL. A MEMBERS HERE. HOW WE HAVE A CERTAIN POSITIONS ARE AND ON DIFFERENT A PORCH? BUT I HOPE WELL WE OR HALF US IN COMMON. MY. A IN OUR HEART TO. IT INCLUDING MYSELF LAW. AS I STATED R. O. DURING THE QUESTION SESSION THAT SAW A AYE I TAKE IT AS A VERY SERIOUS HEALTH CRISES SO IN CALIFORNIA FOR RISING. UP COST OF A HOUSING AND A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE OR AND NOW. ALL OF A FIFTY PERCENT OFF AUDIO INCOME. IS SO USED TO FOR A HOUSING AND THE LIVING VERY LATER FOR OTHER. LIVING EXPENSE IS SOUGHT THIS IS SO. BAKER PRICE IS SARAH AND THE WE NEED TO ADDRESS HOW WE CAN COME UP WITH AND I'M AS I MENTIONED AWHILE AGO. THRUST IF SO CONCERNS ON THAT. AT LEAST I HAVE A AND A SOMEWHAT THE EXPRESSIONS OF THAT I HAD THE FROM MY MEMBERS. BUT TODAY I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED US ALL. ARE I'M NOT IN THE POSITION TODAY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. AT THIS TIME. LET ME ASK IS THERE A MOTION. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD SO MOVED. MOTION MADE BY MISTER BONTA SECOND BY MISTER STONE I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AND I WILL ASK THE AUTHOR. TO CLOSE BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE. UP LET ME ALSO. START MY COMMENTS BY THANKING ALL OF YOU FOR. THIS DISCUSSION WHAT I THINK THE SERGEANTS FOR THEIR HARD WORK TODAY I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR. AND YOUR STAFF AND AND THAT AS WELL AS MY STAFF AND AND MISTER BONTA STAFF. THE CO AUTHORS OF THIS BILL AFTER MOVING THIS FORWARD ONE THANK ALL THE WITNESSES AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AROUND HOUSING ISSUES HERE IN OUR STATE CAPITOL. OF FREE WORK. AS HAS BEEN SAID THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT ALWAYS NEAT. IT IS OFTEN MESSY BUT THANK YOU FOR TAKING PART IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BELLS ONE THANK ALL OF MY CONSTITUENTS ON BOTH SIDES THEY'RE PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF SAN FRANCISCANS. THAT CAME OUT ANNA ON THIS ISSUE ARE AND. AND IN AND SAY I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE PERSPECTIVE THAT EVERYONE BRINGS TO THIS TABLE. I THINK IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS LAST MONTH UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT AB FIFTEEN SIX OR SIX. UNANIMOUS SUPPORT I THINK THAT IS BASED ON WHAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON. ARE THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR CITIES AND OUR STATE THAT WE'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. I AND MY DISTRICT HAS BEEN ONE THE EPICENTERS OF OF THAT CRISIS. LET ME ALSO SAY. THAT I DON'T THINK ANYONE BELIEVES THAT RENT CONTROL IS PERFECT BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT WE HAVE FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE THAT IS PROTECTING. SOME ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IN OUR CITIES. ARM WHEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED. WEEP I BELIEVE THE RENT CONTROL CAN'T OFFER MUCH NEEDED RELIEF TO TENANTS WHILE STILL ENSURING THE PROPERTY OWNERS RECEIVE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY EVERY LOCAL JURISDICTION IN CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE. AND THIS IS WHY I THINK THAT EVERY CITY COUNTY SHOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING WHAT STRATEGIES WORK FOR THEM. ARE WE KNOW HISTORICALLY IN THE PAST THAT NOT EVERY CITY WILL DECIDE TO ENACT RENT CONTROL. AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE. NOR WILL THERE BE CITIES THAT HAVE EXISTING POLICIES THAT MAY I UP TO WERE NOT UP TO MEND THEM BUT IT'S IMPORTANT. TO ALLOW CITIES TO HAVE THOSE CHOICES. AM I WANT TO SAY TO THE OPPONENTS I APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVES I HAVE CERTAINLY BEE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THEM AND ALL OF US I THINK ARE OPEN TO OTHER IDEAS AND HOW WE ADDRESS THIS. BUT AS I WAS TRYING TO MAKE THE POINT EARLIER TODAY I THINK WITHOUT OTHER IDEAS. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BILL NON. I'VE LIVED FOR ALMOST MY ENTIRE LIFE ADULT LIFE HAS ATTENDANCE AND I KNOW. I'VE SPOKEN TO THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO ARE SUFFERING IMMENSELY. WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN EVICTED OR WHETHER THEY ARE ON THE VERGE OF BEING EVICTED. IMMIGRANT TENANTS. FAMILIES WHO ARE TENANTS CHILDREN WHO ARE TENANTS. SENIORS DISABLED WHO ARE TENANTS. LGBT YOUTH. FROM AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY A LATINO COMMUNITY OUR API COMMUNITY. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE SUFFERING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS DISCUSSION MOVE FORWARD AND THAT IS WHY I'M A CO AUTHOR. THAT'S WHY COLLEAGUES I DO HOPE YOU CONSIDER MOVING THIS FORWARD IN WITH THAT. MISTER BLOOM FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE.
