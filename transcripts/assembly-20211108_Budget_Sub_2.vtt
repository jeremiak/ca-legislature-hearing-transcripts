HIGHLIGHT SO DIVING RIGHT IN ON

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:06.564
THE FIRST PAGE WE FOCUS FIRST

00:31:06.631 --> 00:31:09.334
ON THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.101
HOW IT'S HANGED OVER TIME. HIS

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:11.636
STAR THE ROLE OF THE STATE HAS

00:31:11.703 --> 00:31:13.371
BEEN SMALL STUDENT HOUSING

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.973
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:17.208
STUDENT CHARGES. THEY HAVEN'T

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:18.977
BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE STATE.

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:20.612
THIS IS STILL THE CASE ACROSS

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:22.981
MOST OF THE COUNTRY. WE FOUND

00:31:23.047 --> 00:31:24.315
FOR STATES THAT EXPLICITLY

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:26.150
PROHIBIT STATE FUNDING FROM

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.052
BEING USED FOR STATE FUNDING.

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:29.320
WE DIDN'T FIND ANOTHER STATE

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:32.991
THAT SUBSIDIZES STUDENT HOUSING.

00:31:33.057 --> 00:31:34.325
IN THE LATE EIGHTIES IN

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:35.760
CALIFORNIA THE STATE DID

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:37.595
PROVIDE A SMALL AMOUNT OF ONE

00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:39.297
TIME FUNDING TO CREATE A

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:41.065

HELP CSU CAMPUSES. ADD HOUSING-

00:31:45.136 --> 00:31:47.472
AT LOW BORROWING COSTS. SO THEN

00:31:47.538 --> 00:31:49.574
JUMPING FORWARD A FEW DECADES

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.242

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:14.666
TWENTY TWO AND THEN SEVEN

00:32:14.732 --> 00:32:15.466
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THE NEXT

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.502
TWO YEARS. OF THE TOTAL

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.270
ALLOTMENT THE FUNDS ARE SPREAD

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:21.639

50% ALLOTTED TO THE COLLEGES

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:28.379
30% TO CSU AND 20% TO UC. AND

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.514
THEN OF THE COLLEGE ALLOTMENT

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.416
SPECIFICALLY TWENTY FIVE

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.151
MILLION AS RESERVE FOR PLANNING

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:36.921
GRANTS. COLLEGES TO- GET THESE

00:32:36.988 --> 00:32:38.189
GRANTS CAN USE IT EITHER TO

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:40.458
BUILD NEW HOUSING OR TO CONVERT

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:43.227
COMMERCIAL SPACE AND TO HOUSING.

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:44.629
THE NEW PROGRAM HAS TWO MAIN

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.030
GOALS- THE CHAIR ALREADY

00:32:46.097 --> 00:32:47.598
REFERENCED THIS IN HIS OPENING

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.367
REMARKS ONE GOAL IS CAPACITY

00:32:49.434 --> 00:32:50.968
JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:52.737
BEDS WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL OF

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:53.938
HELPING TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:55.773
ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AND THEN THE

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.575
OTHER GOAL IS TO MAKE THAT

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.911
HOUSING AFFORDABLE PARTICULARLY

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:03.514
FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS.

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:05.049
ALTHOUGH THE STATE CREATED THIS

00:33:05.116 --> 00:33:06.351
NEW PROGRAM THERE ARE NO

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:09.253
SPECIFIC CAPACITY GOALS THAT

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.988
THE STATE WANTS TO FUND AN EX

00:33:11.055 --> 00:33:14.492
NUMBER OF BEDS OR ACTS- SHARE

00:33:14.559 --> 00:33:16.294
OF THE UNDERGRADUATE POPULATION.

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:17.595
STATE LAW DOES HAVE A FEW

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.197
PROVISIONS RELATING TO HOUSING

00:33:19.263 --> 00:33:21.065
SO IT ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO OFFER

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:23.368
HOUSING IT ALLOWS CAMPUSES TO

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:25.303
REQUIRE STUDENTS TO LIVE IN

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:27.271
THAT HOUSING. AND OF CAMPUSES

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:29.307
DON'T HAVE HOUSING THEN THERE

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.908
TO GIVE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:33.745
BEDS TO HOMELESS YOUTH AND

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.646
FOSTER YOUTH. NONE OF THE

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:37.582
SEGMENTS THE GOVERNING BOARDS

00:33:37.648 --> 00:33:38.716
OR THE SYSTEM OFFICES HAVE

00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:40.885
UNIFORM CAPACITY GOALS THAT

00:33:40.952 --> 00:33:42.286
APPLY TO ALL CAMPUSES THE

00:33:42.353 --> 00:33:43.721
CAMPUS IS THAT THEIR OWN

00:33:43.788 --> 00:33:46.424
CAPACITY GOALS. MANY CAMPUSES

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.959
ONE HOUSE ALL INTERESTED FIRST

00:33:48.025 --> 00:33:49.994
YEAR STUDENTS SOME ALSO TRIED

00:33:50.061 --> 00:33:51.429
TO HOUSE INTERESTED SECOND YEAR

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:54.399
STUDENTS. IN ADDITION TO GOALS

00:33:54.465 --> 00:33:56.000
AROUND UNDERGRADUATE CAPACITY

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.136
CAMPUSES OFTEN HAVE GOALS TO

00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.871
HOUSE THAT SPECIFIC SHARE OF

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:01.706
GRADUATE STUDENTS AND STUDENTS

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:04.876
WITH FAMILIES. UNSURPRISINGLY A

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:07.078
CAMPUS'S STUDENT BODY HAS A BIG

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.312
IMPACT ON THE SIZE OF ITS

00:34:08.379 --> 00:34:11.082
HOUSING PROGRAM SO CAMPUS IS

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.417
THAT HAVE A HIGH SHARE OF

00:34:12.483 --> 00:34:14.218
STUDENTS COMMUTING AND LIVING

00:34:14.285 --> 00:34:15.486
LOCALLY THEY TEND TO HAVE

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.088
EITHER NO HOUSING PROGRAM OR A

00:34:17.155 --> 00:34:19.657
SMALL PROGRAM. THOSE CAMPUSES

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:21.259
WITH A HIGH SHARE OF NON LOCAL

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:23.161
STUDENTS THOSE AT CAMPUSES THAT

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.495
ARE DRAWING STUDENTS FROM ALL

00:34:24.562 --> 00:34:25.630
OVER THE STATE WHERE STUDENTS

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.031
ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA TO

00:34:27.098 --> 00:34:28.933
ATTEND COLLEGE THEY HAVE MUCH

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.136
LARGER PROGRAMS. PAGE THREE OF

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:34.005
THE HANDOUT SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:37.708
CAPACITY ADDED SINCE TWENTY

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:38.976
FIFTEEN. BOTH SEGMENTS UC AND

00:34:39.043 --> 00:34:40.778
CSU HAVE ADDED SUBSTANTIAL

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:43.681
HOUSING CENTS TWENTY FIFTEEN

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:47.218
CSU REPORTS ADDING A MORE THAN

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.453
FOURTEEN THOUSAND BEDS THROUGH

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.888
TWENTY EIGHT PROJECTS YOU SEE-

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:53.157
HAS REPORTED ADDING ALMOST

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:55.059
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BEDS AT

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.561
TWENTY THREE CAMPUS PROJECTS.

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:57.829
AND SO IN ADDITION TO THOSE BUT

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.663
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.364
CONSTRUCTED OR LAST FIVE SIX

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.999
YEARS THEY'RE ALSO BOTH

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.167
SEGMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:05.503
CONSTRUCTING MORE SEE ISSUES IN

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.505
THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:08.606
TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MORE THREE

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.208
SIX PROJECTS AND YOU SEE IS IN

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.009
THE PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTING.

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.544
ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.313
ADDITIONAL BEDS THREE TWENTY

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:21.052
ONE PROJECTS. FOR PROVIDE SOME

00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:22.587
MORE DATA ON THIS SO YOU CAN

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.755
SEE THAT YOU SEE EVERY CAMPUS

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:26.557
HAS ADDED SOME BAD SINCE TWENTY

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:28.526
FIFTEEN. SANTA CRUZ HAS ADDED

00:35:28.593 --> 00:35:30.228
THE FEW ESTIMATE NUMBER OF BEDS

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.362
BUT I WOULD NOT THERE IN THE

00:35:31.429 --> 00:35:33.531
MIDST OF A PROJECT THAT PROJECT

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:35.399
IS ADDRESSING SOME

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:35.967
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AT THE

00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.503
MOMENT I THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:39.103
MORE ABOUT THAT PROJECT LATER

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:40.638
TODAY. AT CSU ABOUT HALF THE

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.273
CAMPUSES HAVE ADDED BEDS ARE

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.175
LAST FIVE SIX YEARS SAN DIEGO

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.943
SAN LUIS OBISPO SAN FRANCISCO

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.412
HAVE ADDED THE HIGHEST NUMBER

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:52.049
OF NEW BALANCE. PAGE FIVE THE

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.551
FIGURE AT THE TOP SHOWS HOW

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.753
BEDS HAVE INCREASED IN TANDEM

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.355
WITH ENROLLMENT GROW SO IT

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.956
TRIES TO COMPARE WHETHER THE

00:35:59.023 --> 00:36:00.491
INCREASE AND BEDS HAS KEPT PACE

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.393
WITH AN ROAMING GROWTH. AND

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.861
HOUSING CAPACITY HAS SLIGHTLY

00:36:03.928 --> 00:36:07.365
OUTPACED AT AT EACH SEGMENT.

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.766
I'M SO WHAT YOU SEE IT'S GONE

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.601
UP LESS THAN ONE PERCENTAGE

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:13.070
POINT- THE BUT IT HAS GONE UP

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.106
SO THE NUMBER OF BEDS HAVE HAS

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:17.375
INCREASED ABOUT 15% OVER THIS

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:19.377
PERIOD WHILE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:36:19.443 --> 00:36:20.945
INCREASED FOURTEEN PERCENT.

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:23.648
THAT'S THE ISSUE THE- INCREASES

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:26.250
A BIT MORE NOTABLE ITS NUMBER

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:28.986
THE IT SHARE OF BAD HAVE

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:29.654
INCREASED EIGHTEEN PERCENT.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.855
WELL IT SAN ROMAN INCREASED TWO

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:33.224
POINT 3% SO THAT PROBABLY

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.326
SOUNDS LOW TO YOU BECAUSE CSU'S

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:36.727
UNDERGRADUATE RESIDENT

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:37.862
ENROLLMENT HAS GONE UP MUCH

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.264
MORE THAN TWO POINT 3% BUT IT'S

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.999
BEEN OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN

00:36:42.066 --> 00:36:44.402
GRADUATE ENROLLMENT AND

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.170
NONRESIDENT ENROLLMENT. TURNING

00:36:46.237 --> 00:36:47.672
TO THE COLLEGES FOR A MOMENT

00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:49.540
PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN THERE

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:50.841
WERE ELEVEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:52.643
THAT HAD HOUSING PROGRAMS

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.945
ALMOST ALL OF THESE WERE IN

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:56.614
RURAL AREAS. AND ALMOST ALL OF

00:36:56.681 --> 00:37:00.985
THEM ARE LONG STANDING. IN

00:37:01.052 --> 00:37:01.586
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY

00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:02.987
ORANGE COAST COLLEGE OPENED A

00:37:03.054 --> 00:37:03.854
STUDENT HOUSING FACILITY AND

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.489
IT'S THE LARGEST FACILITY

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.558
AMONGST THE COLLEGES RIGHT NOW

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.093
EIGHT HUNDRED BAGS THAT'S FOUR

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.494
TIMES LARGER THAN ANY OTHER

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:11.429
COMMUNITY COLLEGE HOUSING

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:13.564
PROGRAM- AS ITS ACCOUNTING FOR

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.433
ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ALL

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:16.000
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BEDS RIGHT

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:23.107
NOW. SO I'M. WE ALSO LOOKED AT

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.208
HOW DOES THE CAMPUS FIGURE OUT

00:37:24.275 --> 00:37:25.676
WHETHER THERE IS A ON DEMAND

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:28.613
STUDENT DEMAND. AND WE FOUND

00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:29.547
THAT CAMPUS IS THEY USE A

00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:31.282
SIMILAR PRODUCT PROCESS SO

00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:32.850
EVERY YEAR THEY'RE LOOKING AT

00:37:32.917 --> 00:37:34.452
THEIR ON CAMPUS OCCUPANCY

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.687
RATES. AT WAIT LISTS FOR THEIR

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:39.523
ON CAMPUS HOUSING AND NOT

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.024
VACANCY RATES WITHIN THE

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.826
COMMUNITY. AND IF THEIR WEIGHT

00:37:41.892 --> 00:37:43.327
UNSURPRISINGLY IF THEIR WAIT

00:37:43.394 --> 00:37:45.162
LISTS ARE LONG THERE VACANCY

00:37:45.229 --> 00:37:47.665
RATES IN THE AREA ARE VERY LOW

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:48.933
AND THEIR HEART CAMPUS HOUSING

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.568
GOALS AREN'T BEING MET. THEN

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.269
THEY INITIATE A MORE INTENSIVE

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:54.005
STUDENT HOUSING STUDY TO TRY TO

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:56.207
FIGURE OUT WHERE IS THE UNMET

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:57.842
DEMANDS HOW DO THEY BUILD

00:37:57.908 --> 00:37:59.844
ACCORDINGLY. SO THE SURVEY

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.245
STUDENTS TYPICALLY AND

00:38:01.312 --> 00:38:02.980
UNDERTAKE A MUCH FULLER

00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:03.881
ANALYSIS OF THE LOCAL HOUSING

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:06.117
MARKET. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

00:38:06.183 --> 00:38:08.085
FEW UC CAMPUSES THAT HAVE AMMO

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:09.520
USE WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES SUCH

00:38:09.587 --> 00:38:10.688
THAT IF THEY INCREASE

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:11.756
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THEY ARE

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.324
REQUIRED TO INCREASE THEIR

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.826
BADS. UC DAVIS AND UC SANTA

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.628
CRUZ FALL IN THIS CATEGORY YOU

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.630
MIGHT ALSO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:23.968
LATER TODAY. WE LOOK WAIT LESS-

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.603
BUT THE FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.038
FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.506
OF CODE MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.840
DATA FOR YOU IT MIGHT BE

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:31.842
SLIGHTLY ANOMALOUS. BUT NONE

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:33.310
THE LESS THAT DATE AS REPORTED

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:35.546
HERE FOR TALK FALL TWENTY

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:37.748
TWENTY ONE. CSU HAD WAIT LISTS

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:40.885
AT THIRTEEN CAMPUS AS TOTALING

00:38:40.951 --> 00:38:41.786
ABOUT EIGHTY SEVEN HUNDRED

00:38:41.852 --> 00:38:44.555
STUDENTS. AND THAT YOU SEE

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.123
EIGHT CAMPUSES HAD WAIT LISTS

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.492
TOTALING SLIGHTLY MORE THAN

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:49.694
SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.595
THE TO UC CAMPUSES THAT DIDN'T

00:38:51.662 --> 00:38:53.164
HAVE WAIT LISTS FOR UC SAN

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.733
FRANCISCO IT ACTUALLY REPORTED

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.202
A 20% VACANCY RATE RIGHT BEFORE

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.470
THE PANDEMIC IT BROUGHT A

00:38:59.537 --> 00:39:01.672
HOUSING STRUCTURE ONLINE. AND

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.274
IN SAN FRANCISCO STILL DEALING

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:06.243
WITH SOME LINGERING EFFECTS OF

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.411
THE DESTRUCTION OF COALBED. I'M

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:08.946
AND THEN SANTA CRUZ REPORTED

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.214
THAT ALTHOUGH IT MAINTAINS

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.982
WEIGHTLESS TYPICALLY BY THE

00:39:12.049 --> 00:39:13.384
TIME THING SHUFFLE OUT IT ENDS

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:14.685
UP WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:39:14.752 --> 00:39:16.821
VACANCIES AND AT ON CAMPUS

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:19.790
HOUSING PROGRAM. SO IN ADDITION

00:39:19.857 --> 00:39:21.058
TO THE BEDS THAT HAVE ALREADY

00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:22.293
BEEN BILL AND THAT ARE IN THE

00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:23.928
MIDST OF CONSTRUCTION AS WE

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:26.130
SPEAK BOTH SEGMENTS HAVE PLANS

00:39:26.197 --> 00:39:28.566
TO BUILD MORE. CSU WHEN YOU

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.167
LOOK AT THEIR OUT YOUR PLANS

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:31.635
THEY HAVE SEVENTEEN HOUSING

00:39:31.702 --> 00:39:33.270
PROJECTS NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:35.306
AT ELEVEN CAMPUSES WHAT AT

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:39.043
ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND ADDS. AND

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.444
THEN YOU SEE HAS ELEVEN.

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:41.312
HOUSING PROJECTS UNDER

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:44.014
DEVELOPMENT SIX CAMPUSES ADDING

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:46.817
MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND BEDS.

00:39:46.884 --> 00:39:48.352
SO SHIFTING FOR JUST A MOMENT

00:39:48.419 --> 00:39:51.689
FROM CAPACITY TO AFFORDABILITY.

00:39:51.756 --> 00:39:53.057
CAMPUS IS AS YOU KNOW THEY

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:54.959
SACKED THEIR STUDENT HOUSING

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:57.061
CHARGES EVERY YEAR AND THEY

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.529
HAVE TWO MAIN GOALS OF TRYING

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.563
TO COVER THAT PROGRAMS

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:01.565
OPERATING COSTS AND ANNUAL DEBT

00:40:01.632 --> 00:40:03.467
SERVICE COSTS WHILE AT THE SAME

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:04.969
TIME HAVING A CHARGE THAT

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:07.705
STUDENTS CAN AFFORD- IDEALLY

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.840
THAT'S BELOW WHAT THE MARKET IS

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:12.543
CHARGING IN THEIR AREA. LIVING

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.844
ARRANGEMENTS WILL AFFECT THAT

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.680
CHARGE SO CAMPUS IS TYPICALLY

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.649
HAVE A RIGHTY OF TYPES OF

00:40:18.716 --> 00:40:20.584
HOUSING OPTIONS FROM SINGLE TO

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.987
DOUBLE TO TRIPLE ROOMS TO THAT

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.622
SHARE A COMMUNAL BATHROOM ON

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.824
ONE FLOOR. TWO APARTMENTS AND

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:28.659
QUADS INN SUITES WHERE THEY

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:29.960
MIGHT SHARE A KITCHEN AND A

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:32.296
BATHROOM WITH JUST A FEW ROOMS

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:34.431
AND THE PRICES FOR ALL OF THOSE

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:37.835
TWO VERY. AT CSU THE ON CAMPUS

00:40:37.902 --> 00:40:39.236
HOUSING CHARGE WE JUST LOOK FOR

00:40:39.303 --> 00:40:40.704
A DOUBLE ROOM JUST TO GIVE YOU

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:42.706
SOME SENSE OF THE VARIATION

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:45.075
AMONGST CAMPUSES. AND THE

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:47.578
CHARGE RANGES FROM MORE THAN

00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.646
ELEVEN THOUSAND AT FULLER TEN

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.481
AND CHANNEL ISLANDS TO LESS

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.116
THAN SIX THOUSAND PER ACADEMIC

00:40:52.183 --> 00:40:54.685
YEAR AT CSU MONTEREY I'M SORRY

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:56.987
MARITIME AND FRESNO. THAT DATA

00:40:57.054 --> 00:40:58.656
IS ALSO PROVIDED IN MORE DETAIL

00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:01.392
ON THE NEXT PAGE. YOU SEE SENSE

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.960
THAT IT DOESN'T SYSTEMATICALLY

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:04.862
COLLECT DATA ON ITS ON CAMPUS

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:06.797
CHARGES AT ALL CAMPUSES

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.799
RELATIVE TO THE LOCAL MARKETS

00:41:08.866 --> 00:41:11.769
BUT THAT- IT DOES IT INTENDS TO

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:14.104
HAVE ITS ON CAMPUS CHARGES

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:17.174
BELOW MARKET RATE. SO AS I

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.676
MENTIONED ON PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:21.078
SEE THE DATA FOR CSU FOR THE

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.613
SAKE OF TIME I'M JUST GONNA

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.882
LEAVE THAT FOR YOUR REFERENCE.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:27.151
PAGE NINE FOCUSES ON A KEY-

00:41:27.218 --> 00:41:29.987
ASPECT WE WERE ASKED TO- AT

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:31.722
INVESTING- LEARN MORE ABOUT

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:34.258
WHICH IS HOW CAMPUSES FINANCE

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.227
THEIR FACILITY PROJECTS. FOR

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:37.995
SOME PROJECTS UNIVERSITY SELL

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:40.731
BONDS AND THEY REPAY THE DEBT

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:42.099
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE BONDS

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:44.034
FROM THE ANNUAL STUDENT HOUSING

00:41:44.101 --> 00:41:46.136
CHARGES TYPICALLY REPAYMENT

00:41:46.203 --> 00:41:47.504
OCCURS OVER ROUGHLY THIRTY

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:50.507
YEARS. CAMPUSES LIKE LIKE MANY

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:52.042
OF YOU WITH MAYBE A HOME

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:54.044
MORTGAGE THEY DO PUT A LITTLE

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.512
BIT DOWN TYPICALLY SOMETHING

00:41:55.579 --> 00:41:57.481
LIKE FIVE OR 20% THEY PAYING

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.383
CASH UP FRONT THIS TENDS TO

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.085
HELP THEM GET MORE FAVORABLE

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:05.055
BARLEY IN TERMS. SOME PROJECTS

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.223
USE UP PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.558
PARTNERSHIP WHICH ARE THESE

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.793
LOCALLY NEGOTIATED AGREEMENTS

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.662
BETWEEN A PRIVATE PARTNER TO

00:42:11.729 --> 00:42:12.863
AND A DEVELOPER AND THEN THE

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.599
CAMPUS. IN THE SAME WAY THAT A

00:42:15.666 --> 00:42:17.701
REVENUE BOND IS RETIRED THOUGH

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.603
A P. THREE THAT WILL ALSO BE

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:21.238
RETIRED USING ANNUAL STUDENT

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.140
HOUSING CHARGES TO COVER THE

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.042
DEBT SERVICE PAYMENT OVER THE

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:28.012
AMORTIZATION PERIOD. IN MANY

00:42:28.078 --> 00:42:30.047
CASES WITH THE P. THREE THE P.

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.315
THREE ISN'T THE PARTNER IS NOT

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:32.750
ONLY HELPING WITH CONSTRUCTION

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:33.984
BUT THEY'RE ALSO MAINTAINING

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:35.819
AND OPERATING THE FACILITY FOR

00:42:35.886 --> 00:42:37.421
A SET PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.323
AFTER THAT TIME LAPSES SAY

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:40.424
THIRTY YEARS FULL CONTROL OF

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.259
THE FACILITY- GOES TO THE

00:42:42.326 --> 00:42:45.229
CAMPUS. AND THE THIRD MAIN WAY

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:48.198
THAT- SOME PROJECTS AND AS A

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:49.900
MUCH LESS COMMON WAY IS THROUGH

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:52.202
DONOR SUPPORT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:54.138
AT THE COLLEGES TWO THIRDS OF

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.072
THEIR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:56.907
FINANCED WITH LOCAL BONDS AND

00:42:56.974 --> 00:42:58.642
THEN ROUGHLY A THIRD THROUGH A

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.678
P. THREE ARRANGEMENT. WHEN YOU

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:02.646
LOOK AT CSU CAMPUSES MOST OF

00:43:02.713 --> 00:43:04.581
THEIR PROJECTS ARE DONE WITH

00:43:04.648 --> 00:43:07.518
REVENUE BONDS. AND THEN YOU SEE

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:10.721
HAS USED A MIX OF BONDS P.

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:13.090
THREE IS AND ON OUR SUPPORT-

00:43:13.157 --> 00:43:15.125
OVER OVER THE COURSE OF TIME P.

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.094
THREES HAVE BEEN MORE PREVALENT

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:21.498
THAT YOU SEE THAT OTHERS. SO

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:22.900
THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:24.501
WILL AFFECT WHAT KIND OF

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:26.136
FINANCING APPROACH A PROJECT

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.706
TAKES. SO THOSE CAMPUSES THAT

00:43:28.772 --> 00:43:30.741
HAVE LARGE AND OR LONG STANDING

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:33.410
HOUSING PROGRAMS RELATIVELY LOW

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:36.146
LEVELS OF THAT EXISTING HOUSING

00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:37.314
FACILITIES THAT ARE IN GOOD

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.149
CONDITION. UNSURPRISINGLY THESE

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:39.683
OTHER ONES THAT HAVE MORE

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.719
BUDGET CAPACITY THEY CAN STILL

00:43:41.785 --> 00:43:43.754
CHARGE ANNUAL HOUSING CHARGES

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.122
AND THEN THEY CAN BUILD UP

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.523
THEIR RESERVES AND WHEN THEY GO

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:47.791
TO THE MARKET THEY'LL HAVE MORE

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.059
TO MAKE IS THE DOWN PAYMENT

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.527
BILL TYPICALLY GET BETTER

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.997
BORROWING TERMS. NEWER CAMPUSES

00:43:53.063 --> 00:43:54.665
CAMPUSES WITH SMALLER HOUSING

00:43:54.732 --> 00:43:56.367
PROGRAMS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.935
ASSOCIATED THAT WITH AN OLDER

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.336
HOUSING STOCK THAT NEEDS

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.205
SUBSTANTIAL RENOVATION. THEY'RE

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:02.439
NOT GONNA HAVE THE SAME LEVEL

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.041
OF RESERVES TYPICALLY SO WHEN

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.342
THEY GO OUT TO THE MARKET THEIR

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.945
BAR IN TERMS WILL TYPICALLY BE

00:44:08.012 --> 00:44:10.781
SOMEWHAT LESS ADVANTAGEOUS. SO

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.316
AGAIN BOTH SETS OF GROUPS ARE

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:14.084
ABLE TO ACCESS THE MARKET JUST

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.586
TENDS TO BE NOT AS FAVORABLE

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:16.987
FOR SOME CAMPUSES RELATIVE TO

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:20.791
OTHERS. SO THEN ON PAGE ELEVEN

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.559
ANOTHER TOPIC WE WERE ASKED TO

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.695
LOOK INTO IS WHAT ARE THE

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.563
CONSTRAINTS WHY IS IT THAT SOME

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.700
CAMPUSES- ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.301
ADDING CAPACITY AT AN

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:33.871
AFFORDABLE RATE. AND ONE THAT

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:35.506
OBVIOUSLY CAME UP AGAIN AND

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.875
AGAIN WAS FINANCING. BUT IT

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:39.410
WASN'T FINANCING IN THE SENSE

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.045
OF HITTING A DEBT LIMIT OR DEBT

00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:42.980
CAPACITY BOTH OF THE SYSTEMS

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:44.281
REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:46.116
BILLIONS OF ROOM LEFT UNDER

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.184
WHAT MIGHT BE A LIKE A

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.919
THEORETICAL OR EVEN PRACTICAL

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:49.953
THAT STEALING LIKE THEY CAN'T

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.488
GO TO THE MARKET AND ACCESS

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:53.457
ADDITIONAL BORROWING. AND THEY

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:55.325
REPORTED THAT DEBT LIMITS

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:56.827
WEREN'T THE THING THAT WAS

00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.128
PREVENTING ANY PARTICULAR

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:01.632
CAMPUS FROM PURSUING A PROJECT.

00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:03.400
BUT WHAT ALMOST EVERY PROJECT

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:05.636
VOICE TO US IS THAT IT'S JUST

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:08.238
HARD TO MAKE PROJECTS VIABLE SO

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:09.473
WHAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS MAKE

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.474
SURE THAT THEY BUILD THE

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.709
FACILITY AT SUCH A WAY THAT

00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:13.710
THEY CAN COVER THE ANNUAL

00:45:13.777 --> 00:45:15.746
OPERATING COSTS THE ANNUAL DEBT

00:45:15.813 --> 00:45:17.648
SERVICE COSTS AND STILL HAVE A

00:45:17.714 --> 00:45:19.016
RATE CHARGING STUDENTS THAT

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.417
THEY THINK IS AFFORDABLE THAT

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:21.819
STUDENTS WOULD STILL BE WILLING

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:23.687
TO PAY. SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:26.390
FOR ALL PROJECT ALMOST ALL

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:27.858
PROJECTS. WHAT SOME CAMPUS ARE

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:29.393
ABLE TO DO PARTICULARLY THOSE

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:30.861
THAT HAVE LOTS OF HOUSING

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:32.362
FACILITIES IS THEY CAN TAKE THE

00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:33.997
OLDER FACILITIES THAT MIGHT

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:35.999
HAVE RETIRED THEIR DEBT SERVICE

00:45:36.066 --> 00:45:37.267
BUT THEY'RE STILL HAVING

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:39.136
REVENUE FROM STUDENT CHARGES SO

00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:40.404
THEY HAVE RESERVES. THEY CAN

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:42.072
USE THAT TO CROSS SUBSIDIZE THE

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:43.640
NEWER HOUSING FACILITIES FOR

00:45:43.707 --> 00:45:45.109
THE FIRST FEW YEARS TO MAKE

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:47.377
THOSE RATS MORE MANAGEABLE FOR

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:50.481
STUDENTS. ANOTHER MAJOR

00:45:50.547 --> 00:45:52.349
CONSTRAINT THAT WE HEARD FROM

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.384
ALMOST EVERY CAMPUS. DEALT WITH

00:45:54.451 --> 00:45:56.453
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SO CAMPUS

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.622
SAYS FOR ANY LARGE PROJECT HAVE

00:45:58.689 --> 00:45:59.957
TO FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA

00:46:00.023 --> 00:46:01.291
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT SO

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:04.228
THE SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS SEES.

00:46:04.294 --> 00:46:06.063
AND CAMPUS IS COMMONLY REPORT

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:07.464
THAT THOSE PROCESS FEES AND

00:46:07.531 --> 00:46:09.166
POTENTIAL LITIGATION ASSOCIATED

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.300
WITH THEM CAN INCREASE THEIR

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:11.935
COST AND LENGTH AND THEIR

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:14.238
PROJECT TIME. NOW HAVING SAID

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:15.706
THAT AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW

00:46:15.772 --> 00:46:17.774
CONCERNS MISTY QUAD TRACED BACK

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:19.510
DECADES AND THE STATE

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.178
PERIODICALLY HAS DONE THESE

00:46:21.245 --> 00:46:22.846
INTENSIVE REFUSE TO TRY TO

00:46:22.913 --> 00:46:24.781
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND TRY

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.750
TO BALANCE ALL OF THE ISSUES AT

00:46:26.817 --> 00:46:29.586
STAKE. SO FOR THE SAKE OF THIS-

00:46:29.653 --> 00:46:31.255
HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR TIME

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.023
FRAME WE DIDN'T DO A DEEP DIVE

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.658
ON THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THE

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.260
STATE MIGHT HAVE TO DO FURTHER

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:38.295
STREAMLINING IT COULD BE AN

00:46:38.362 --> 00:46:39.630
AVENUE YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:41.131
MOVING FORWARD BUT AGAIN THAT

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.766
HAS BEEN DONE PERIODICALLY BY

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:45.369
THE STATE TO TRY TO IMPROVE AND

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.404
STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS. WHERE

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.605
WE HEARD FINANCING AN

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.307
ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS FROM

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:51.942
ALMOST EVERY PROJECT IN CAMPUS

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.178
WE TALKED TO A FEW OF THEM SAID

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:55.679
THEY HAD THE ADDED CHALLENGE OF

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:58.148
LAND ACQUISITION. SO WE TENDED

00:46:58.215 --> 00:46:59.349
TO HEAR THAT'S UNSURPRISINGLY

00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:01.251
FROM CAMPUSES THAT ARE FEEL

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.819
FULLY BUILT OUT AND OR THEY

00:47:02.886 --> 00:47:04.621
FACE GEOGRAPHIC CONSTRAINTS

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:06.523
FROM BUILDING OUT THEY THEY-

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.358
BUMP UP AGAINST AN OCEAN OR A

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:10.327
FOREST OR MOUNTAIN OR CITY

00:47:10.394 --> 00:47:11.295
DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:12.963
OBVIOUSLY MAKE IT MORE

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.298
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BUILD.

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:16.300
THIS CAMPUS IS STILL PURSUE

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:17.634
HOUSING PROJECTS BUT THEY TEND

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.203
TO HAVE TO DEMOLISH AND BUILD

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:21.038
UP OR RENOVATE AND BUILD UP SO

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:25.008
THAT THEY CAN NOT THE CAPACITY.

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:25.842
SO BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THERE

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.077
WOULD BE INTEREST IN THIS NEW

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:28.545
PROGRAM THAT THE STATE RECENTLY

00:47:28.612 --> 00:47:30.747
CREATED ON PAGE TWELVE WE DO

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:32.349
PROVIDE SOME VERY PRELIMINARY

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:35.185
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT PROGRAM.

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:37.321
SO APPLICATIONS WERE DUE UNDER

00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.522
STATE LAW THEY WERE DUE TO THE

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.057
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OCTOBER

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:41.191
THIRTY FIRST SO JUST ABOUT A

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.492
WEEK AGO. AND THE

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:44.461
ADMINISTRATION- VERY JUST ARE

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:46.230
GENEROUSLY IN QUICKLY SHARED

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:46.830
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION WITH

00:47:46.897 --> 00:47:49.566
US. FINANCED RECEIVED A HUNDRED

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:51.235
AND THIRTEEN APPLICATIONS

00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:52.836
TOTALING THREE POINT THREE

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:55.172
BILLION. SO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:57.140
THE CHART EACH STATEMENT

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:59.676
REQUESTED MORE THAN THEIR TOTAL

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:01.378
PROGRAM ALLOTMENTS NOT JUST

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:03.380
THEIR ALLOTMENT FOR TWENTY ONE

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:03.981
TWENTY TWO BUT ACTUALLY THEIR

00:48:04.047 --> 00:48:05.349
TOTAL ALLOTMENT ACROSS THE

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:07.451
THREE YEARS. SO THERE WAS LOTS

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:10.254
OF INTEREST IN THIS PROGRAM

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.423
LOTS OF APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.292
FOR THE LAST TWO PAGES OF- I'M

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:17.494
SORRY- WHAT WE ALSO TRIED TO DO

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:18.695
JUST A FEW WOULD FIND IT

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.264
INTERESTING US TO TAKE SOME OF

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.965
THAT PRELIMINARY INFORMATION

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:23.166
AND GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW

00:48:23.233 --> 00:48:24.401
FAR THE STATE DOLLARS WOULD

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.703
STRETCH. SO BASED UPON JUST A

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.005
SAMPLE OF THOSE APPLICATIONS

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:30.607
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PEEK AT-

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:32.809
THE COST PER BED COULD RANGE

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:35.812
FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:36.780
THOUSAND TO MORE THAN THREE

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.548
HUNDRED THOUSAND. SO WITHIN

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:41.451
THAT RANGE- THIS THE PROGRAM

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:43.387
THIS NEW CASH PROGRAM THE STATE

00:48:43.453 --> 00:48:46.690
CREATED COULD FIND BETWEEN

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:47.224
SEVEN THOUSAND AND TWELVE

00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.659
THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PADS. SO

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.093
THAT WOULD INCREASE TOTAL

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.095
HOUSING CAPACITY ACROSS THE

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:54.031
THREE SEGMENTS BY 427%

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.466
DEPENDING ON WHERE THE EXACT

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.235
COST PER BAD LANDED. HAVING

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.636
SAID THAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE VERY

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.171
DIFFERENT EFFECTS ACROSS THE

00:49:01.238 --> 00:49:02.806
THREE SEGMENTS BECAUSE OF THE

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.508
WAY THE PROGRAM ALLOTMENTS WORK

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:06.109
WITH 50% RESERVE FOR THE

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:07.678
COLLEGES TWENTY FOR IT THE

00:49:07.744 --> 00:49:09.513
UNIVERSITIES. SO YOU MIGHT SEE

00:49:09.579 --> 00:49:11.415
HOUSING CAPACITY DOUBLE AT THE

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.784
COLLEGES. MAYBE INCREASE

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:17.554
SOMEWHERE LIKE 325% AT CSU AND

00:49:17.621 --> 00:49:21.692
THEN ONE OR 2% THAT YOU SEE.

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.694
THOSE APPLICATIONS AGAIN WILL

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.162
COME YOUR WAY AND MARCH THE

00:49:25.228 --> 00:49:26.463
ADMINISTRATION WILL GO THROUGH

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:27.698
THOSE APPLICATIONS AND THEN

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:29.900
GIVE YOU A FIRST STEP TO REVEAL

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:33.003
COME MARCH. THE LAST TWO PAGES

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.304
NOW THEY HAVE NOT JUST FOCUSED

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.173
ON THE TAKE AWAY SO WE DID THIS

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:37.841
ENDEAVOR AND TALKING WITH THESE

00:49:37.908 --> 00:49:39.042
VARIOUS GROUPS ON WHAT WE

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:42.512
WALKED AWAY- WITH IS THAT.

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:43.747
THERE IS A SENSE THAT CAMPUSES

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:45.449
HAVE BEEN AND ARE ADDING

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.884
CAPACITY SO EVEN WITHOUT STATE

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.486
FUNDS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.822
NAVIGATE THESE CHALLENGES-

00:49:51.888 --> 00:49:53.390
THEY'VE THEY'VE ADDED BEDS

00:49:53.457 --> 00:49:54.157
THERE NOW IN THE MIDST OF

00:49:54.224 --> 00:49:56.326
CONSTRUCT IN THEM AND THEY HAVE

00:49:56.393 --> 00:49:58.895
PLANS FOR MORE. CAMPUSES ARE

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:00.364
ALSO SOMEWHAT UNIQUE AS THE

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.032
LANDLORD BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.367
REQUIRE STUDENTS TO LIVE ON

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:05.469
CAMPUS AND AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:07.137
THEIR PROJECT RISK IS SOMEWHAT

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:08.472
LOWER BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:09.272
SOMEWHAT GREATER

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:10.974
PREDICTABILITY. AND WHAT THEIR

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.509
FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS WILL BE

00:50:12.576 --> 00:50:13.844
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY CAN

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.012
REQUIRE AGAIN STUDENTS TO SHOW

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:30.227
UP AND PAY. I WE KNOW THAT AT

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:31.728
LEAST AT THIS TIME OVER THE

00:50:31.795 --> 00:50:32.963
COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:34.231
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN AT

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:36.466
HISTORICAL LOWS. INTEREST RATES

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.135
ARE A BIG FACTOR IN WHETHER A

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.436
CAMPUS WANTS TO PURSUE A

00:50:39.503 --> 00:50:41.438
HOUSING PROJECT SO IT'S BEEN

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.006
VIEWED AS A PARTICULARLY

00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.142
ATTRACTIVE TIME TO BUILD. NO

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:46.610
INTEREST RATES MIGHT START

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:48.745
GOING UP OVER THE NEXT COMING

00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:51.181
QUARTERS AND YEARS- IF THEY GO

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:52.182
UP A LITTLE BIT I THINK

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:54.084
CAMPUSES MIGHT STILL VIEW IT AS

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:55.952
FAVORABLE IF THEY GO UP STEEPLY

00:50:56.019 --> 00:50:57.954
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T STAND DYNAMICS

00:50:58.021 --> 00:51:00.123
ARE GOING TO CHANGE. OUT WHAT

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.258
IT TAKES TO MAKE A PROJECT

00:51:01.324 --> 00:51:04.461
FISCALLY VIABLE IS GOING TO BE

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:04.961
MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANTLY

00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:07.631
AFFECTED. WE ALSO WALKED AWAY

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.166
RECOGNIZING THAT CAMPUS

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:09.966
CHALLENGES TEND TO BE A

00:51:10.033 --> 00:51:12.102
LOCALIZED. SO ALL OF THESE

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.537
FACTORS I MENTIONED THIS

00:51:13.603 --> 00:51:15.172
MORNING I CAMPUSES FISCAL

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:18.008
CONDITION IT'S EXISTING HOUSING

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.210
STOCK THE STATE OF THAT STOCK.

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:21.678
THE CURRENT LOCAL HOUSING

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:23.647
MARKET CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.215
THAT AREA THE SPECIFIC

00:51:25.282 --> 00:51:26.917
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT A

00:51:26.983 --> 00:51:29.019
CAMPUS IS DEALING WITH. THE

00:51:29.085 --> 00:51:31.455
COMMUNITY CONCERNS THIS DIFFER

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:34.524
ACROSS ACROSS CAMPUS AS- SUCH

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.626
THAT IF THE ANY STATE POLICY

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.228
RESPONSE LIKELY WOULD WANT TO

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.396
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.664
OFFER SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.199
CAMPUSES TO DEAL WITH THOSE

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:44.167
PARTICULAR CHALLENGES THEY'RE

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:48.538
FACING. WE ALSO RECORD A WALKED

00:51:48.605 --> 00:51:51.675
AWAY- WITH THIS RECOGNITION

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:53.743
THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.345
THE STATE HAS FOR ADDRESSING

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:58.815
AFFORDABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:51:58.882 --> 00:52:00.250
ONE MAJOR WAY THE STATE HAS

00:52:00.317 --> 00:52:02.419
TRIED TO DO THIS IS STARKLY IS

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:03.487
AND IN TERMS OF HELPING

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:04.621
STUDENTS WITH THEIR LIVING

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.122
COSTS IS THROUGH FINANCIAL AID

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.358
PROGRAMS. AND OVER THE LAST FEW

00:52:08.425 --> 00:52:09.426
YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:10.827
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE

00:52:10.894 --> 00:52:12.262
AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID FOR

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.264
LIVING COSTS AS PROVIDED MORE

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:15.599
AID FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:16.666
STUDENTS WHO ARE GOING FULL

00:52:16.733 --> 00:52:18.068
TIME FOR STUDENTS WITH

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:19.870
DEPENDENT CHILDREN FOR FOSTER

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:21.771
YOUTH. AS PART OF THE MIDDLE

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:23.306
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP TWO POINT OH

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:24.574
IT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:27.010
LIVING AID FOR UC AND CSU

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.412
STUDENTS. AND THEN IN ADDITION

00:52:29.479 --> 00:52:30.847
TO THESE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:32.382
AID PROGRAMS THE STATE HAS

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:33.884
CREATED THESE RAPID RE HOUSING

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.886
PROGRAMS. AND WHAT MIGHT BE

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.654
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU IS CAMPUSES

00:52:37.721 --> 00:52:39.055
REPORT THAT THOSE RAPID RE

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.390
HOUSING PROGRAMS ARE WORKING SO

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.259
THEY'RE SETTING ASIDE SLOTS

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.160
WHEN A STUDENT INDICATES THAT

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:45.495
THEIR HOUSING SITUATION IS

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:46.696
VULNERABLE WHERE THEY CAN PUT

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:48.164
THEM IN A RESIDENTIAL HALL AND

00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:49.966
GIVE THEM STABLE HOUSING. FOR

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:51.301
SOME COURSE OF TIME BEFORE THEY

00:52:51.368 --> 00:52:52.469
CAN MOVE THEM AND EITHER TO

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:53.870
ANOTHER HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:56.840
THAT'S STABLE ARE JUST STAYING

00:52:56.907 --> 00:52:59.209
RIGHT THERE IN. A RESIDENTIAL.

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.911
SO WE WALKED AWAY NOT REALLY

00:53:00.977 --> 00:53:02.345
HAVING A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:03.580
HOW THE NEW HOUSING GRANTS

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:04.614
WOULD INTERACT WITH THESE

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:05.949
TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID

00:53:06.016 --> 00:53:07.217
PROGRAMS AS WELL AS THE RAPID

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.419
RE HOUSING PROGRAMS. AND I

00:53:09.486 --> 00:53:10.854
THINK IT'S STILL OPEN ISSUE

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.022
WHETHER THOSE HOUSING GRANTS

00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:14.291
WILL BE MORE OR LESS EFFECTIVE-

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:16.226
AT HELPING STUDENTS THAN THESE

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:18.395
OTHER PROGRAMS NOW A BIG CAVIAR

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:19.963
IS THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.131
YOUR FINANCIAL AID IN RAPID

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:22.198
REHOUSING PROGRAMS. THEIR

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.534
ONGOING AND THIS IS A ONE TIME

00:53:24.601 --> 00:53:26.069
THEN THE HOUSING PROGRAM AS ONE

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:27.971
TIME SO THAT'S A BIG

00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.639
CONSIDERATION FOR YOU. THE

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.341
FOURTH AND FINAL TAKE AWAY IS

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:32.642
THAT THE STATE IS FACING

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:34.377
SIGNIFICANT FISCAL TRADE OFFS

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.946
SO IF THE STATE WANTS YOU SEE

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.347
AND SEE IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE TO

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:39.316
ADD STUDENTS. FOR SOME CAMPUSES

00:53:39.382 --> 00:53:40.717
THAT WILL MEAN NOT ONLY KNEW

00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.185
HOUSING SPACE BUT NEW ACADEMIC

00:53:42.252 --> 00:53:44.554
SPACE. AND CAMPUSES RELY VERY

00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:46.556
HEAVILY ON THE STATE FOR THEIR

00:53:46.623 --> 00:53:48.625
ACADEMIC SPACE. THE STATE

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.193
OBVIOUSLY STILL WANTS CAMPUSES

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.394
TO SERVE OTHER EXISTING

00:53:51.461 --> 00:53:53.630
STUDENTS AND SAFE- WELL

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:54.965
MAINTAINED FACILITIES AND ALL

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:56.399
THE SEGMENTS ARE REPORTING

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.233
BACKLOG OF DEFERRED

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:59.402
MAINTENANCE. SO BIG FISCAL

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:00.503
TRADE OFFS FOR YOU BETWEEN

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.339
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. NEW

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.274
ACADEMIC SPACE AND NO HOUSING

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:07.177

YOU TALK ABOUT OTHER BRANDS YOU

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.633
KNOW WHEN EVERYONE PART OF THE

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.601
COST OF THE TO LIVE THERE. ARE

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:32.602
THE NUMBER OF UNITS AT A

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.536
CONSTRUCTION BUT THERE WASN'T

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:35.005
TOO MUCH THERE WAS TOO MUCH IN

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.272
DEPTH ON HOW MUCH IT COST TO

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.174
CONSTRUCT EACH UNITS. OF NEW

00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:39.442
HOUSING LEAVE TALK I THINK YOU

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:43.747
SAID BETWEEN. ONE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:44.280
THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.249
THOUSAND. IS IT IS IT. IS THAT

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:47.617
THAT THAT'S QUITE A RANGE.

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:49.786
RIGHT IS ARE THERE ANY FACTORS

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.154
BUILT INTO THAT RANGE THAT

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.589
YOU'RE AWARE OF AS FAR AS JUST

00:54:52.656 --> 00:54:54.724
JUST. JUST JUST TO SEE CSU OR

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.426
UC DO A BETTER JOB. AT

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:57.861
CONSTRUCTING HOUSING IN A MORE

00:54:57.927 --> 00:55:00.096
EFFICIENT MANNER COST. COST

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.264
FRIENDLY MANNER ACCEPT OR DO

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:02.599
YOU HAVE ANY. CAN YOU ADD

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:04.267
ANYTHING TO THAT CONVERSATION.

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:06.503
YEAH IF IT'S HELPFUL WE LOOKED

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.972
AT THE CSU IN THE- FIRST ROUND

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:10.607
OF APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED EIGHT

00:55:10.674 --> 00:55:13.243
APPLICATIONS. AND THEIR COST

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:16.246
PER PROJECT PER BAD. RANGE FROM

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:17.580
TWO HUNDRED AND TWO THOUSAND

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:19.182
TWO I THINK THREE HUNDRED AND

00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:19.983
FOUR THOUSAND SO IF A NOTABLE

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:22.118
RANGE THEIR AVERAGE WAS TWO

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.453
HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.121
WHEN WE LOOK OVER PROJECTS WE

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:27.257
HAVE LIMITED DATA ON THE OTHER

00:55:27.323 --> 00:55:28.525
SIX MONTHS AND SOME OTHER

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:30.927
HOUSING PROJECTS OVER TIME-

00:55:30.994 --> 00:55:33.463
AND- IT IS ALSO HOUSING CUT

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.998
CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE GOING UP

00:55:35.065 --> 00:55:36.132
SO EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT IT YOU

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:37.434
SEE HOUSING PROJECT FROM FOUR

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.735
YEARS AGO WE KNOW IT'S NOT A

00:55:38.802 --> 00:55:40.503
GREAT. INDICATOR WHAT THEY PAY

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:41.371
IF THEY WANT TO THE MARKET

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:43.740
TODAY. BUT THOSE TEND TO BE IN

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:46.776
THE HIGH ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:55:46.843 --> 00:55:47.711
TWO HUNDRED THOUSANDS. SO THIS

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:49.512
IS A BIT OF GAS WORK WE REALLY

00:55:49.579 --> 00:55:50.647
WERE JUST TRYING TO GIVE YOU A

00:55:50.714 --> 00:55:52.382
SENSE OF ROUGHLY HOW MUCH YOUR

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:54.751
CAPACITY WOULD ADD. I THINK I

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:55.919
APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THE

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:57.353
QUESTION AT THE FISCAL ANALYSTS

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.122
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:01.291
MUCH SHOULD A BAD COST AND WHAT

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:02.559
FACTORS SHOULD YOU BE

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:03.693
CONSIDERING AND TRYING TO

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.495
CONTROL THE COST. AND AS YOU

00:56:05.562 --> 00:56:06.896
WORK WITH FINANCE OVER THE NEXT

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:07.664
FEW MONTHS ARE THESE

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.165
APPLICATIONS YOU'VE GOT TOO

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:10.667
HIGH OF A COST COULD MAYBE RE

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:11.801
ENGINEERING THE BUILDING TO

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:14.003
GIVE YOU MORE BEDS BUT STILL. A

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.438
GOOD FACILITY WHERE STUDENTS

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.107
ARE STATE FAN THEY HAVE GOOD

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:22.779
COMMUNAL. SPACE- BUT WE HAVEN'T

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:24.314
I. DON'T REALLY. INTO HOW TO

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.749
FIGURE. WHETHER THE RATE ARE

00:56:25.815 --> 00:56:27.283
ARE BALLPARK REASONABLE WHEN

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.285
YOU LOOK AT HISTORY THERE

00:56:29.352 --> 00:56:32.489
BALLPARK REASONABLE. OKAY IT

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.857
WOULD JUST ONE MORE QUESTION SO

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:36.392
AND SO I THAT AND ALSO WE DON'T

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:38.261
HAVE ANY DATA RELATIVE TO.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:40.196
WHETHER OR NOT- HOW MANY

00:56:40.263 --> 00:56:42.365
BENEFACTORS ARE GIVING. TO

00:56:42.432 --> 00:56:44.734
BUILD. TO AYE ANYONE OF THE

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.369
SYSTEMS TO BUILD STUDENT

00:56:46.436 --> 00:56:47.403
HOUSING AND I YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.439
A CIRCUS AND IN SANTA BARBARA

00:56:49.506 --> 00:56:51.674
RIGHT NOW RIGHT. SO I MEAN IS

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.610
THAT HAPPENING ALL OVER THE UC

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.445
SYSTEM CSU SYSTEM AS A ONE

00:56:55.512 --> 00:56:57.280
SEGMENT GETS MORE MONEY. FROM

00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.915
BENEFACTOR ENSURE THAT PLAN HOW

00:56:58.982 --> 00:57:00.049
MUCH WE SUPPORT EACH SYSTEM AS

00:57:00.116 --> 00:57:03.720
WELL ANY OPINIONS YEAH- AS WE

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:04.888
LOOKED AT HOW THE COMMUNITY

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:07.557
COLLEGE AND CSU PROJECTS WERE

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.659
FUNDED SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN. I

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.194
DON'T THINK WE CAME ACROSS A

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:12.729
SINGLE PROJECT A STUDENT

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:14.697
HOUSING PROJECT THAT WAS

00:57:14.764 --> 00:57:16.599
FINANCED IN ANY NOTABLE WAY

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:17.901
FROM PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT I

00:57:17.967 --> 00:57:19.636
DON'T KNOW IF THEY GOT MUCH IN

00:57:19.702 --> 00:57:21.471
THE PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT. YOU

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:23.039
HEAR ABOUT IT AT UC CAMPUSES

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.240
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A BIG

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:25.441
ONE ON THE NEWS OF LATE

00:57:25.508 --> 00:57:26.409
REGARDING THE UC SANTA BARBARA

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:29.312
PROJECT BUT EVEN NOT YOU SEE

00:57:29.379 --> 00:57:31.581
IT'S NOT HOW- IN. ANY NOTABLE

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.383
SHARE OF THEIR FACILITIES ARE

00:57:33.449 --> 00:57:36.119
FINANCE P. THREES- FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.453
OVER THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.222
WERE ACCOUNTING FOR ABOUT 40%

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.690
ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OR ACCOUNTED

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:43.126
THROUGH REVENUE BONDS. SO YOU

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.694
CAN ASK OUR OBVIOUSLY YOUR

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:46.129
SEATS TO GIVE YOU MORE ACCURATE

00:57:46.196 --> 00:57:47.430
INFORMATION THIS AFTERNOON BUT

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:49.566
I HAVE A SENSE IT'S- LIKE LESS

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.167
THAN 10% OF THEIR HOUSING

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.203
FACILITIES ARE FUNDED THROUGH

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.470
PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT THAT

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.306
MIGHT EVEN BE. TOO HIGH BUT BUT

00:57:56.372 --> 00:58:00.510
I APPRECIATE THAT THE GAS AND.

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:01.110
YOU SEE IS IN THE ROOM SO THEY

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:01.711
CAN CLARIFY. OKAY THANK YOU.

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:02.712
THE ONLY REASON I IS THAT

00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:04.914
COULD. IF THE BENEFACTORS

00:58:04.981 --> 00:58:06.449
DESIGNING THE BUILDING. THAT

00:58:06.516 --> 00:58:07.984
COULD IMPACT THE ULTIMATE COST

00:58:08.051 --> 00:58:09.919
OF THE BUILDING. AND THEN YOU

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.387
HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER IT'S

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:11.955
WORTH HAVING THAT BENEFACTOR

00:58:12.021 --> 00:58:13.790
EVEN IN THE END MAYBE YEAH ONE

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.191
OF THE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.392
WAYS IN THIS I THINK IS A

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:18.161
FUNDAMENTAL TENSION BEFORE YOU

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:19.562
IS YOU CAN START GETTING

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.197
GREATER ASSUREDLY ON THE COST

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:24.033
PER BED BY PRESCRIBING SOME OF

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.668
THE ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS OF

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:27.804
THE BUILDING HOW MANY STUDENTS

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:29.372
YOU WANT IN A ROOM. HOW MANY

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:31.474
BATHROOMS YOU WANT PER STUDENT

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.776
ACCESS TO KITCHENS EXIDE ROCK

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.378
THAT WILL ALL AFFECT HOW MANY

00:58:35.445 --> 00:58:37.614
WINDOWS YOU WANT PER PROBE AS

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.716
ROOM ARE COMMON STUDY SPACE

00:58:39.782 --> 00:58:41.417
AREAS HOW MUCH YOU WANT FOR IN

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:43.253
ROOM SOURCES COMMON STUDY SPACE

00:58:43.319 --> 00:58:44.520
BUT THESE ARE THINGS THE STATE

00:58:44.587 --> 00:58:45.855
TRADITIONALLY HAS NOT WEIGHED

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.725
IN ON- AND SO THE BIG TENSION

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.592
IS DO YOU WANT TO BE

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.094
PRESCRIPTIVE SO YOU KNOW WHAT

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.395
YOU'RE GETTING SPECIFICALLY

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:54.297
WITH THE DOLLARS. OR DO YOU

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:55.598
WANT TO JUST GIVE THE CAMPUSES

00:58:55.665 --> 00:58:56.900
MONEY MAYBE HAVE A REPORT ON

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.468
THE BACKEND IN TERMS OF HOW

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.136
MANY BEDS WERE ADDED THE PRICE

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.105
PER BED WHAT THE RESULTING

00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:04.173
MONTHLY RENTS WILL BE AND GET

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.875
US FUNDS ON THAT WHOLE HOLD

00:59:05.942 --> 00:59:07.143
THEM ACCOUNTABLE ON THAT BACK

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:08.711
AND IT IS THAT. IT'S A

SO- THE WILL COME OF THAT BACK

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.755
THAT THE SECOND BUT- THE FIRST

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:28.091
PICTURE THE FIRST THING IS. AS

01:00:28.157 --> 01:00:29.092
YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S VERY

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:31.127
DIVERSE YOU KNOW SOME SEE

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.228
ISSUES AND FRESNO AND

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.930
BAKERSFIELD AND CSU SAMBAR TO

01:00:33.997 --> 01:00:35.665
DINO AND- MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:38.201
THE- HUGE NEED. FOR STUDENT

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.403
HOUSING IT'S A COMMUTER CAMPUS

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.572
OR THERE IS. A LOT OF HOUSING

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:44.741
NEXT TO THE CAMPUS AS WELL. AND

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.175
THEN IT YOU THAT YOU SEE IS.

01:00:46.242 --> 01:00:47.977
THAT IT'S MORE NEED FOR STUDENT

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:50.413
HOUSING- BUT SOME IT SOUNDS

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.247
VERY DIFFERENT WHERE AS YOU

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:53.282
KNOW THAT UC. BERKELEY AND

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:54.617
SANTA BARBARA AND SANTA CRZ LA

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.086
DOES NOT LAND BUT IT DAVIS AND-

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:00.223
RIVERSIDE MERCED. THERE'S A LOT

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.224
OF LAND SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:04.227
APPLES AND ORANGES. BUT I'M

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:08.197
KIND OF. PERPLEXED BECAUSE-

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.098
WHEN I'VE GONE TO TALK TO.

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:10.299
CHANCELLORS AND PRESIDENTS AS

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:14.203
HAS. CHAIR MEDINA A LOT OF THEM

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:17.407
HAVE SAID- THE SAME THING WHICH

01:01:17.473 --> 01:01:19.242
IS THEY WANT TO BUILD MORE

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:22.245
HOUSING. AND IT'S KIND OF A LOW

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:24.313
RISK PROPOSITION BECAUSE YOU

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.449
HAVE STUDENTS. THERE'S MORE

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.518
COMING THEIR HOUSING AND SECURE

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.153
IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU CAN

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:32.055
FORCE THEM OR COERCE THEM TO

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:32.789
COME ON CAMPUS FOR THE FIRST

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.390
COUPLE YEARS WHICH IS A GOOD

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.725
THING THEY DO BETTER IF THEY'RE

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:38.661
ON CAMPUS. YOU KNOW THAT

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:39.262
THEY'RE GONNA COME YEAR AFTER

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:41.230
YEAR FOR. UNLESS YOU HAVE A

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.231
GLOBAL PANDEMIC WITH I WAS A

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:44.100
LITTLE BLIP SO IT'S PRETTY

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.935
SOLID BUSINESS PROPOSITION YOU

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:46.736
KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.938
EVERY YEAR YEAH YOU ARE GROWING

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:51.607
EVERY YEAR. AND SO YOU GET INTO

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.709
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY. YOU

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:55.044
WOULDN'T IF YOU HAD A POT OF

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.146
MONEY TO BUILD THE HOUSING IF

01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.081
YOU BUILD IT THEY WILL THEY

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.215
LITERALLY WILL CON BECAUSE

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:01.117
THEY'RE THERE ANYWAY. SO A LOT

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:02.985
OF THESE CAMPUSES HAVE SAID

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:04.787
THAT THEY'RE RUNNING THEY RUN

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:07.790
INTO COMPETING- FINANCIAL

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.292
CONSTRAINTS WITH THEIR DEBT

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:10.526
CAPACITY AND SO I HEARD THAT

01:02:10.593 --> 01:02:12.562
OVER AND OVER UC'S NC ISSUES

01:02:12.628 --> 01:02:14.897
THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND THEN

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:16.632
YOUR RESEARCH WHAT I 100%

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:17.533
BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHEN

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.668
YOU TALK TO THE SYSTEM AND

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.702
WE'LL GET TO THIS WILL BE

01:02:19.769 --> 01:02:22.038
PASSED UC AND CSU TO COME OUT.

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.005
THERE SAYING DIFFERENTLY AND

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.242
THEN WE HAD SOME CHANCES AT THE

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.843
END WHO ARE SPEAKING SO. CAN

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:28.211
YOU HELP US ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:32.682
FIRST. EIGHT I YEAH I APOLOGIZE

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:33.616
IN ADVANCE IF IT'S NOT A

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.818
PARTICULARLY SATISFYING ANSWER

01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:36.619
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IS

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:38.855
THAT. CAMPUS IS FEES FISCAL

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:40.556
CHALLENGES AND THEY SEEM LIKE

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:42.391
REALLY SERIOUS CHALLENGES AND

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.293
THIS IS THE PERENNIAL WE TALK

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.728
TO ANY LOCAL OR STATE AGENCY

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:48.164
THEY ARE ALWAYS FACING A

01:02:48.231 --> 01:02:50.099
SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGE.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.767
AND I AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:53.536
OUR REASONS WHY THEY ARE TO

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.637
MAKE A HOUSING PROJECT PENCIL

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:57.073
OUT. THEY HAVE TO BE SKILLED AT

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.207
WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO GET ALL

01:02:58.274 --> 01:02:59.709
THE PIECES TO WORK JUST RIGHT

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:01.177
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO DESIGN

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:03.079
A FACILITY. TO BE ABLE TO GO

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.647
OUT THE MARKET AT THAT TIME

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:07.350
DELIVER IT ON SCHEDULE ON PRICE

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.584
AND THEY NEED TO HAVE THE DEBT

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.553
SERVICE AND THE OPERATING COSTS

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.588
THAT WILL GO INTO PERPETUITY

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:15.658
THERE AFTER. AND PENCIL IT ALL

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.527
OUT AND THAT IS DIFFICULT. I'M

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.295
NOT SURPRISED THAT WHETHER IT'S

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:21.030
YOU OR ME GOING OUT TO TALKING

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.965
TO PEOPLE WE ARE HEARING THAT

01:03:23.032 --> 01:03:25.034
FINANCING AS A CHALLENGE. I

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:27.203
THINK THE KEY. CHALLENGE THE

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:30.606
KEY FOR POLICY ISSUE IS IT'S A

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.842
CHALLENGE. ARE YOU PREVENTED

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:34.844
FROM DOING WHAT YOU WANT OR IS

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.612
IT A CHALLENGE THAT YOU FACE

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:38.414
AND I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IS

01:03:38.481 --> 01:03:40.316
THESE ARE SERIOUS CHALLENGES

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:41.984
BUT THEY DON'T PREVENT US FROM

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:44.287
BUILDING. THEY DON'T PREVENT US

01:03:44.353 --> 01:03:46.322
FROM BEING ABLE TO. FIGURE OUT

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.224
THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING AND

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.425
BE ABLE TO COVER THE DEBT

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.760
SERVICE AND THE OPERATING COSTS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.195
AND STILL HAVE A MONTHLY CHARGE

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:55.798
THAT IS WITHIN THE- REALM OF

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.166
REASON FOR MOST STUDENTS. SO

01:03:57.233 --> 01:03:58.267
THEN IT BECOMES LAW HOW CAN THE

01:03:58.334 --> 01:04:02.338
STATE- HAVE A- IMPORTANT ROLE

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:06.275
HERE- AND IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:08.211
TRICKIER BECAUSE YOUR- AGAIN

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:08.978
WE'RE TRYING TO SIGN IN THE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.246
ABSENCE OF STATE MONEY WHAT

01:04:10.313 --> 01:04:11.847
WOULD OTHERWISE HAPPEN AND

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.082
CAMPUSES ARE SHOWING YOU THAT

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.917
THEY'VE BUILT OUR BUILDING HAVE

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:17.420
PLANS TO BUILD THE MARKET IS

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:19.155
SAYING IT'S A GOOD ENVIRONMENT

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:22.391
TO BUILD- BUT THIS ISN'T SAYING

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:23.793
YOU WILL NOT YOU WILL HEAR FROM

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.761
DISTRICTS. I PROBABLY FOR YEARS

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:28.497
TO COME THAT VACANCY RATES ARE

01:04:28.564 --> 01:04:31.100
LOW WAIT LISTS ARE LONG.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.036
HOUSING IS HARD ESPECIALLY FOR

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:37.640
A LONG FROM FOLKS TO COVER- AND

01:04:37.707 --> 01:04:38.741
I'M SORRY TO HAVE SUCH A

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.309
DISSATISFIED ANSWER AT THE

01:04:40.376 --> 01:04:41.777
MOMENT BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:43.479
UNFORTUNATELY I NORMALLY YOU

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.014
AND THE RESURGENT GOVERNOR LIKE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:46.449
ALL THE STATE POLICY SOLUTION

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.351
IS OBVIOUS THAN HERE AS YOU

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.352
PROBABLY HEARD WITH ALL YOUR

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.653
HOUSING CONVERSATIONS THERE'S

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.089
NOT LIKE A SIMPLE OBVIOUS

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.458
SOLUTION. MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:57.660
OUT SOME PRIORITY RULES THAT

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.228
REALLY GIVE THE GRANTS TO THOSE

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.364
VERY ISOLATED AREAS THAT ARE

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.432
NOT ABLE THEY THEY THEY PROVE

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:05.268
TO YOU THAT THEY CAN'T OVERCOME

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.036
IS MORE THAN JUST A CHALLENGE

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:08.170
IT'S AN INSURMOUNTABLE

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:10.172
OBSTACLE. AND YOU SOMEHOW

01:05:10.239 --> 01:05:11.140
FIGURE OUT WHERE ARE THOSE

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:13.342
PLACES AND HOW CAN WE GIVE THEM

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:15.011
JUST ENOUGH SO THAT THEY CAN

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.245
MAYBE GO TO THE MARKET AND

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.280
ACCESS THAT MAYBE THEY JUST

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:18.347
DON'T HAVE THE RESERVE LEVELS

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.749
BECAUSE THEIR DEBT LOAD RIGHT

01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:22.184
NOW IS HIGH. AND CREDIT RATING

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:23.586
RAIDERS ARE LOOKING NOT THOUGHT

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.721
SO MAYBE THAT'S THE AREA AND

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:27.123
MAYBE YOU CAN STILL DO THAT IN

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.324
THE MIDST OF THE NEW PROGRAM

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.091
YOU JUST LOOK AT THE

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:30.826
APPLICATIONS VERY CAREFULLY TO

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.328
TRY TO MAKE THIS JUDGMENT CALL

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.329
AS TO WHETHER IT'S JUST A

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:36.032
CHALLENGE OR AN INSURMOUNTABLE

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:36.999
BARRIER. YEAH I THINK THAT'S

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.268
THE ISSUES THAT LOCAL FIRST. WE

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:40.603
HAVE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.104
BECAUSE WE JUST. WE HAVE THAT-

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:43.706
DURING OVER THREE YEARS IF YOU

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.209
I GUESS THE ISSUE IS. YOU KNOW

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.944
LIKE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I USED

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.112

01:05:50.179 --> 01:05:52.715
TEN YEARS- AS YOUR COUNCIL

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.617

A- WEEK SOMETIMES YOU DO LIKE

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.888
TE KIND GAP FINANCING YOU LOOK

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.189

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:03.092
HOUSING PROJECTS THAT ARE. IN

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:03.659
NEED GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT TO

01:06:03.726 --> 01:06:04.627
PUT HIM OVER THE TOP. SO THAT

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:06.362
WE WANT TO DO TO JUST PUT LIKE

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:07.830
A LITTLE BIT OF CASH TO PUT

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:08.964
THEM OVER THE TOP THE DOWN

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.900
PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. TO HELP

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.668
THEM. TO LOWER THEIR

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:14.203
AFFORDABILITY ABOUT WHICH WE

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.372
HEAR FROM YOU SEE SAN DIEGO.

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:18.507
WHICH IS WHICH IS CASH. BUT

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.076
SOME OTHERS ARE SAYING WOULD

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.410
EVEN NEED THAT WE JUST NEED US

01:06:21.477 --> 01:06:23.245
TO HAVE THIS POT OF MONEY OVER

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.314
THERE TO ALLOW US TO DRAW DOWN.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.950
KIND OF LIKE COSIGN. AND SO

01:06:28.017 --> 01:06:29.919
WE'RE KIND OF AT A LOSS. WHICH

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:32.054
ONE TO DO SO DO WE DO THEM BOTH

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.456
DO WE DO THAT AS IS IT EITHER

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:36.959
OR- BASED UPON WHAT WE HEARD

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.061
THE FIRST OPTION SEEMS LIKE IT

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.097
WOULD BE MORE PROMISING. AND

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.898
THAT LIKE WITH A REVOLVING LOAN

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.266
FUND ONE OF THE MAJOR

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:45.267
ADVANTAGES AS LOW COST

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:47.103
BORROWING AND THE FIELD IS

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.437
TELLING U RIGHT NOW LOW COST

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:50.172
BORROWING IS NOT AN ISSUE.

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.941
INTEREST RATES ARE LOW WE CAN

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:55.277
GO TO MARKET AND ACCESS CASH-

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:57.480
BUT- BEING ABLE TO GO IN ACCESS

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:59.248
CASH YOU STILL ON AGAIN FOUGHT

01:06:59.315 --> 01:07:01.650
TO HAVE THIS PROJECT. RESULT IN

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.119
MONTHLY CHARGES THAT STUDENTS

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.321
CAN AFFORD. SO IT MIGHT BE

01:07:05.388 --> 01:07:06.355
SOMETHING LIKE THE GAP

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.157
FINANCING WHERE IF WE JUST GAVE

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:09.258
THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE THEY

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.460
WOULD BE ABLE TO PENCIL OUT.

01:07:11.527 --> 01:07:16.098
THE PROJECT- AT THAT WOULD

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.600
OBVIOUSLY WE'D HAVE TO AS AN

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.934

01:07:54.103 --> 01:07:55.971
THOSE IMPORTANT ISSUES-

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.406
ESPECIALLY FOR NONTRADITIONAL

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.074

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:25.100
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.469
EARLY CONVERSATIONS THAT DO

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:28.070
MAKE THIS AN ALLOWABLE PRACTICE

01:08:28.137 --> 01:08:30.005
WHERE COLLEGES PROBABLY WORST

01:08:30.072 --> 01:08:31.974
YES YOU WOULD GET TOGETHER TO

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:33.075

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.231
NATURE OF ALL OF THOSE

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:57.833
APPLICATIONS. WHEN WE WERE

01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:00.469

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.275
EXPRESSING INTEREST IN THE IDEA

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:07.510
I THINK WE WERE STILL AT TWO

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.079
PRELIMINARY OF A STAGE FOR THEM

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.448
TO HAVE. SPECIFICITY AND HOW IT

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.149
WOULD WORK WHO IS WHICH

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:15.351
STUDENTS WOULD BENEFIT WHERE

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.186
THE CAMPUS- FACILITY WOULD BE

01:09:17.253 --> 01:09:18.621
LOCATED BUT I IMAGINE IN THESE

01:09:18.687 --> 01:09:20.055
FOUR APPLICATIONS THERE IS THAT

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:22.992

THEY'RE TRYING TO WORK IT OUT I

01:09:29.798 --> 01:09:30.466
THINK THERE'S STILL THIS

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.101
PRACTICAL ISSUE OF WILL THEY BE

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.235
ABLE TO WORK OUT ALL THOSE

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:34.937
REALLY CRUCIAL DETAILS. WILL

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.205

REVISIT THAT. AND THEN TO SOME

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:23.792
OF YOUR CAMPUSES ARE SAYING IN

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.527
ADDITION TO THAT. IT WAS THE

01:19:25.594 --> 01:19:27.662
ONLY A TALKED ABOUT TWO IS FIND

01:19:27.729 --> 01:19:30.532
OUT. CASH STATE APPROPRIATION

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.634
TO HELP. OTHER BY DOWN THE

01:19:32.701 --> 01:19:34.169
AFFORDABILITY LIKE SAN DIEGO'S

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:36.605
GONNA MENTION A LITTLE BIT. OR

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:39.875
JUST. DO YOUR- UP FRONT COSTS

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:42.444
IN YOUR- TOWN HE ENDURED SUCH

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.245
FOR YOUR DOWN PAYMENT WOULD

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:44.880
HAVE COVERED CHICHI KIND OF

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:45.747
CATEGORIZE THAT IS THAT

01:19:45.814 --> 01:19:47.249
ACCURATE. THAT'S ALRIGHT I

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:48.884
THINK THAT THE REVOLVING LOAN

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.318
FUND HAS ADVANTAGE THAT WE CAN

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.887
BECAUSE WE CAN NOW LEVERAGE IT

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.089
AND REDEPLOY IT. IT'LL IT'LL

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:56.091
HELP US FINANCE MANY MORE

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.292
THOUSAND BEDS. I MEAN I DO

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.827
THINK THERE IS GAP FINANCING

01:19:58.894 --> 01:19:59.694
THAT'S IMPORTANT IN THE

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:02.330
UNCERTAIN SAID SITUATIONS BUT-

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:03.665
THE REVOLVING LOAN FUND ENABLE

01:20:03.732 --> 01:20:04.799
US TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.701
THAT AND THEN ALSO- REDEPLOYED

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.503
AS A PRINCIPAL IS PAID BACK-

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.704
SO. THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE

01:20:09.771 --> 01:20:10.939
THAT WOULD STRETCH OUT OVER

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.641
DECADES- IN RUNNING OUR

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.643
PROGRAMS YEAH. AND THEN YOU

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:17.979
KNOW WE WE'VE SEEN SOME CITIES.

01:20:18.046 --> 01:20:19.714
YOU HAVE ALL THE- THE HIGHER

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:20.849
EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA'S

01:20:20.916 --> 01:20:24.085
MAINLY THE UC. WE HAVE. HUGE

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:27.556
ENROLLMENT- DEMAND AND JUST

01:20:27.622 --> 01:20:29.558
LIMITED SUPPLY AND IN SOME OF

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:32.027
THE UC CAMPUSES. LIKE BERKELEY

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:36.364
AND- AND LA- SANTA CRUZ AND

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.300
SANTA BARBARA YEAH WE'RE JUST.

01:20:38.366 --> 01:20:40.068
NOT IT'S NOT A PLAN TO GO

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:43.071
AROUND SO SOME CITIES HAVE SUED

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:45.640
AND GROUPS HAVE SUED AND- TWO

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:46.841
TWO QUESTIONS ONE THERE IS

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:52.581
APPARENTLY AT A LOWER COURT.

01:20:52.647 --> 01:20:53.114
DECISION IN BERKELEY. WHAT

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:55.617
WHICH THAT- THIS WHAT IMPACT

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.587
ALL. GROWTH IT FOR IN YOU SEE

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.155
AND CAN CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:03.124
THAT YOU MUST HAVE ONE FOR ONE-

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:04.793
NEW NEW BAD WHEN YOU BRING ON

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.027
THE STUDENTS RELATED TO YOUR

01:21:06.094 --> 01:21:08.063
LONG RANGE PLAN CAN YOU GIVE US

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:10.098
AN UPDATE ON THAT. YEAH THE

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:11.533
LOWER COURT ACTUALLY RULED THAT

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.135
ENROLLMENT WAS A VIABLE- A

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:15.570
FACTOR IN IN SECRET

01:21:15.637 --> 01:21:16.871
DETERMINATIONS WHICH THE NEVER

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.873
BAN- A PREVIOUSLY AND THAT'S

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.342
SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:21.810
CHALLENGING BUT MOST OF OUR

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:22.744
SETTLEMENTS- AS YOU KNOW CHAIR

01:21:22.811 --> 01:21:25.480
MCCARTY DO INVOLVE FOR EXAMPLE

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:26.214
YOU KNOW SANTA CRUZ IN THEIR

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:27.215
LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:28.316
SAID THAT THEY WOULD BUILD A

01:21:28.383 --> 01:21:29.517
NEW BAD FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.419
STUDENT. THAT WAS BROUGHT ON UC

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:35.290
SANTA BARBARA- HAD SAID THE-

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:37.592
THE- THE SAME THING YOU KNOW

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:39.027
THEY'RE UNDER POTENTIAL THREAT

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:41.363
FROM THE CITY BELIEVED ON- ON

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:42.998
ON THEIR ENROLLMENT I THINK

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.599
YOU'LL FIND GOING FORWARD

01:21:44.666 --> 01:21:46.835
ESPECIALLY IN THESE VERY- THE

01:21:46.901 --> 01:21:48.570
LAND CONSTRAINED CAMPUSES AT

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:53.408
THAT WILL BE A FACTOR OF MANY.

01:21:53.475 --> 01:21:54.042
OF OUR A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT

01:21:54.109 --> 01:21:57.812
PLANS. OKAY AND THEN DID YOU

01:21:57.879 --> 01:21:58.947
WANT TO POTENTIALLY ADDRESS

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:02.284
THIS. THIS UC SANTA BARBARA.

01:22:02.350 --> 01:22:04.619
ISSUE AND WHAT SOME OF THE NEXT

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:07.555
STEPS ARE THERE RELATED TO THE-

01:22:07.622 --> 01:22:09.024
THE DESIGN AND I'LL SAY THAT I

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.158
WENT DOWN AND TOWARD THIS

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.193
FACILITY OVER THE SUMMER THE

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:14.729
HOUSE CANCER YANG I THOUGHT IT

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:15.330
WAS AN AMAZING IDEA. THAT YOU

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.499
SEE HAS. UC SANTA BARBARA HAS A

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.334
HUGE HOUSING CRISIS THERE AND I

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:20.869
LIVE ESTAS OVERPOPULATED AND

01:22:20.935 --> 01:22:22.404
KIDS LIVING IN SQUALOR THERE.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:25.173
HE SENT TO HAITI IN ISLA VISTA.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.841
AND SO THEY HAVE THIS. THIS

01:22:26.908 --> 01:22:28.543
PAST WHERE THEY HAVE SOME YEAH.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:31.346
ESSENTIALLY THEIR COURTYARD AND

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:34.015
SOME OTHER LOWER INTENSE USES

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.150
AND SO SANTA BARBARA'S GONNA

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:37.252
MOVE THOSE A MILE AWAY IT IS A

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:38.553
PROPERTY THEY BOUGHT LIKE AN

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.322
ABANDONED BAG. WAREHOUSE WHICH

01:22:40.388 --> 01:22:41.790
I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA AND

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:44.326
THEN USE THAT AREA ON CAMPUS.

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.193
TO DO A DANCE HOUSING PROJECT

01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:47.862
WHICH IS. GREAT YOU KNOW.

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.931
INFILL ANYA SMART GROWTH.

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:52.267
OPPORTUNITY THERE- AND WHEN I

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.835
TOWARD I DIDN'T I DIDN'T EVEN

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.337
RECOGNIZE TOWARD THE MOCK UP

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:56.571
AND I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE THE

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:58.373
FACT THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A MOCK

01:22:58.440 --> 01:22:59.007
UP WE DON'T HAVE ACTUAL WINDOWS

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.809
THAT THERE WEREN'T. THE WINDOWS

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:02.711
AND SO THAT'S BECOME THE ISSUE

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:05.146
AND SO FORTH SO. I THINK THE

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:07.382
ISSUE IS WE WANT MORE STUDENT

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:09.351
HOUSING THERE WE LIKE THIS

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:10.852
FORTY FIVE. HUNDRED INTERNET

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:13.121
THING THAT ALLOWS US TO. MEET

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.889
THE NEEDS OF SANTA BARBARA

01:23:14.956 --> 01:23:18.026
WHICH- YOU KNOW HAS A HUGE

01:23:18.093 --> 01:23:20.061
HOUSING CRISIS IN THAT CITY.

ON THE ISSUE OF THIS- HOW PA.

01:24:23.158 --> 01:24:23.725

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT-

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.267
THAT WILL NEED TO GO NOT ONLY

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.735
TO THE REGIONS BUT ALSO TO THE

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:35.403
COASTAL COMMISSION FOR REVIEW

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:37.572

HAS TO BE REVIEWED- AS YOU BUT

01:24:42.744 --> 01:24:46.381
I DO KNOW CHAIRMAN PARTY BY THE

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:49.284
HEIGHT- IF THEY HAD. THAT ALL

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:50.985
THOSE- IT HAPPENS AND IT WOULD

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:52.086
COME TO THE REGION'S FOR

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:53.888
APPROVAL BOTH FOR SEQUEL- FOR

01:24:53.955 --> 01:24:55.723
BUDGET FOR DESIGN AND AN

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:57.492
EXTERNAL FINANCING THAT'S

01:24:57.559 --> 01:24:58.092
SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.028
VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE- AS AS YOU

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.362
MENTIONED EVEN WITH THE GIFT

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:02.397
WOULD STILL BE OVER A BILLION

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.832
DOLLARS IN FINANCING AND THAT

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.633
WOULD BE A BIG PART OF OUR- OUR

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.335
OVERALL LOVE. A PORTFOLIO WE

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:08.703
WANT TO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.239
THE IMPACT ON ON CREDIT- YOU

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.674
KNOW IT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:15.076
SIZE AND SCOPE IN DESIGN AND-

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:15.977
I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:19.047
SCRUTINY TO- TO THE PROJECT-

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:20.448
BUT THAT BEING SAID AS YOU. AS

01:25:20.515 --> 01:25:22.517
YOU NOTED- UC SANTA BARBARA

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:24.018
REALLY REALLY NEEDS HOUSING

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:24.586
THEY'RE SEEING IT MORETHAN

01:25:24.652 --> 01:25:26.754
EVER THIS FALL. THEY HAVE THEIR

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.324
A 118% OF THE HOUSING CAPACITY

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.493
BECAUSE- I LOVE THIS THAT WE'RE

01:25:31.559 --> 01:25:32.760
YOU KNOW KIDS USED TO JUST CRAM

01:25:32.827 --> 01:25:35.263
AND THEY'VE THEY'VE- HAD MUCH.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:36.364
LESS DENSITY THERE BECAUSE OF

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:37.799
THE PANDEMIC AND SO KIDS HAVE

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.467
BEEN LEFT WITHOUT HOUSING. THE

01:25:39.534 --> 01:25:40.768
UC SANTA BARBARA'S BEEN DOING A

01:25:40.835 --> 01:25:43.071
LOT OF TROUBLES FOR DOUBLES AND

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.305
QUADS OR TRIPLES AND THINGS

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:46.274
LIKE THAT- AND THEY HAVE NOT

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:47.876
ADDED ANY HOUSING SINCE THE

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:50.078
FALL OF TWENTY- TWENTY

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.212
SEVENTEEN SO. WE'RE GOING TO

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.447
WORK FOR THE CAMPUS AND SUPPORT

01:25:52.514 --> 01:25:53.915
THEM ANYWAY WE CAN TO TRY TO

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:56.551
GET MORE HOUSING IS. AS QUICKLY

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:59.187
AS POSSIBLE- I ALSO THINK THAT

01:25:59.254 --> 01:26:00.321
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF DOING

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:01.322
THINGS IN COMBINATION WITH SOME

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.124
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE.

TO CAP THEIR ENROLLMENT- AND

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.815
LESS THEY BUILT A UNIT OF

01:26:27.882 --> 01:26:29.584

ABOUT NINE THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.160

NEW BD FOR ALL NEW ENROLLMENT

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:48.069
SO WOULD IT WOULD LET IT WOULD

01:26:48.136 --> 01:26:49.704
MITIGATE SOME OF THE IMPACT ON

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:52.106
THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:53.207
THEIR RENTAL MARKET. SO IT'S

01:26:53.274 --> 01:26:54.976
BEEN OF THE OF THE OBJECTIVE.

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:57.011
OF THE LEGISLATURE IN FACT JUST.

01:26:57.078 --> 01:26:57.612
PRETTY MUCH A COUPLE

01:26:57.679 --> 01:26:59.013
LEGISLATORS ARE HERE IN THE

01:26:59.080 --> 01:26:59.647
ROOM TODAY TO INCREASE

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:02.884
ENROLLMENT. SO IS THIS SOME.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:03.985
SOME ROUND ABOUT WAY TO

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:05.853
ACTUALLY. ENSURE THAT THEY

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.554
DON'T HAVE TO INCREASE

01:27:06.621 --> 01:27:09.123
ENROLLMENT- NO I THINK WE WANT

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.258
TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT WE ALSO

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.326
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:13.094
BEING- YOU KNOW SENSITIVE TO

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.963
THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND-

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:16.598
SANTA CRUZ IN PARTICULAR THE

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:20.201
CHANCE WILL BE- TESTIFYING BUT-

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:21.903
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE. OUR

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.605
COMMUNITY WHERE THEY THE- CITY

01:27:23.671 --> 01:27:25.740
REALLY FEELS THAT THE STRAIN OF

01:27:25.807 --> 01:27:28.042
THE GROWTH HAS BEEN- IMPACT ON

01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:29.811
THEIR HOUSING MARKET. WELL I

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.980
LIVE RIGHT BY LONG BEACH STATE.

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:33.915
AND IT'S A BIG CAMPUS AND I

01:27:33.982 --> 01:27:34.749
KNOW IT WAS THERE WHEN I MOVED

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:37.485
IN. RIGHT SO I HAD TO PUT UP

01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:38.686
WITH THE IMPACTS AND I SEE A

01:27:38.753 --> 01:27:40.655
GREATER BENEFIT. TO THAT THAN

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:42.590
JUST MY OWN HOME SO I THAT

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:44.125
CONCERNS ME THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:45.460
UNIVERSITIES WOULD BE ALLOWED

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.629
TO. TO IN EFFECT LIMIT THEIR

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.497
GROWTH. IS THAT WELL AND I

01:27:49.564 --> 01:27:50.732
DON'T SENATE REASONABLE CONCERN

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:51.933
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.734
LIMITING THE GROWTH OF JUST

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:53.935
SAYING THAT THEY WILL IT WILL

01:27:54.002 --> 01:27:56.037
ADD A BAD WHICH WE CAN DO. YOU

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:56.871
KNOW WHY AND HOW THEY CAN'T DO

01:27:56.938 --> 01:28:00.475
THAT WHEN. THEY DON'T HAVE ONE

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:00.975
OF THE DON'T HAVE THAT.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:03.011
RESOURCES TO A BEDS ONE HALF.

01:28:03.077 --> 01:28:04.812
WHAT WE DO ASSIST WE DO HAVE.

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:05.913
AS A SYSTEM HOW THE ABILITY TO

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:08.983
ADD MORE BEDS TO- YOU KNOW TO

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:10.184
MEET THE GROWING DEMANDS. OKAY

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:11.285
I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR THAT

01:28:11.352 --> 01:28:12.954
BUT- I JUST GOTTA GET IN. MY

01:28:13.021 --> 01:28:15.590
CONCERN. WILL BE THIS BE SOME

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:16.057
ATTEMPT BY INDIVIDUAL

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.593
UNIVERSITIES. TO LIMIT THEIR

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.628
GROWTH YEAH I KNOW IT WASN'T I

01:28:20.695 --> 01:28:21.696
MEAN THIS WAS DRIVEN MOSTLY BY

01:28:21.763 --> 01:28:23.398
THEIR- YOU KNOW NEGOTIATIONS

01:28:23.464 --> 01:28:25.166
AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT.

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:28.469
pCOMMUNITIES. NOT BY ANY DESIRE

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.171
TO- I MEAN THEY WANTED TO GROW

01:28:30.238 --> 01:28:31.639
I MEAN BASICALLY GROW BY FIFTY

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:34.008
PERCENT. BY PROVIDE HOUSING TO

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:35.610
DO THAT. THANK YOU THINK AND I

01:28:35.677 --> 01:28:36.644
JUST ANOTHER QUESTION WITH

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:40.248
REGARD TO THE UCSB PROJECT- SO

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.850
I MEAN IT IS IT. IS YOU. THE IT

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.052
INDIVIDUALS OFFER THEM TWO

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:45.687
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT

01:28:45.753 --> 01:28:47.655
NOW THERE'S ALSO OTHER. MONEY

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:48.956
FROM THE UNIVERSITY COMING AND

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:50.091
I DO BELIEVE THE PROJECTS LIKE

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.960
ONE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS PLUS.

01:28:53.027 --> 01:28:54.762
I SAW HOW MUCH SWAYED AS AN

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.764
INDIVIDUAL DONOR HAVE. OVER THE

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:58.166
ULTIMATE DESIGN OF A FACILITY

01:28:58.232 --> 01:29:00.201
WHICH FOR WHICH THEY WANT TO.

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.370
GET MONEY FOR THE- THE DONOR-

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:04.405
I. TEND TO NOT HAVE MUCH SWAY

01:29:04.472 --> 01:29:06.407
THAT YOU KNOW THE DESIGN IS ALL

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.643
DONE BY APPROVED BY THE REGENTS

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:09.944
AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.313
REGION'S- YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:14.449
THAT THE DONOR HAD SOME VERY.

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:16.851
SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT- ABOUT

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.286
HOUSING AND HE'S PUT THEM INTO

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.554
EFFECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:23.324
MICHIGAN SO- YOU KNOW HE HE HAS

01:29:23.391 --> 01:29:24.759
WEIGHED IN WITH THE CAMPUS

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:26.227
ARCHITECTS ON THAT. KNOW

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.361
WHETHER THAT IS THE ULTIMATE

01:29:27.428 --> 01:29:29.330
DESIGN YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE IT

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:31.065
WILL HAVE TO SEE THERE ARE.

01:29:31.132 --> 01:29:32.767
SOME ADVANTAGES OF IT IN TERMS

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:33.534
OF AMASSING BUT THEY'RE ALSO

01:29:33.601 --> 01:29:36.270
SOME. SOME CONCERNS ABOUT IT.

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.272
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN A- A

01:29:38.339 --> 01:29:41.743
POSTCODE WORLD. OKAY AND ABSENT

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.778
THE FINANCING. I MEAN. IT WILL

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:44.479
LOOK BACK TO THE FOR. OTHER

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:45.980
OTHER EXAMPLES ACROSS THE UC

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:47.749
SYSTEM WHERE. A DONOR HAS

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.951
GIVEN. A GOOD SUM OF MONEY AND

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:52.653
THEY GET TO. HAVE A ROLE IN

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.288
THAT IS THE DESIGN. IS

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:55.590
INDIVIDUAL TO NOT HAVE A ROLE

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.191
IN THE DESIGN THERE ARE.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.459
PROJECTS THAT ARE CALLED DONOR

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.128
DEVELOPED PROJECTS WHERE THE

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:02.497
DONOR WILL ACTUALLY- BUT- IT

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.031
ALL HAS TO GO THROUGH THE BOTH

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.700
THE CAMPUS DESIGN PROCESS AND

01:30:05.767 --> 01:30:07.168
THE REGION'S BUT THEN THE DONOR

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.703
WILL ACTUALLY. THESE ARE MOSTLY

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.371
FOR ACADEMIC BUILDINGS THE

01:30:10.438 --> 01:30:11.139
DON'T THEIR DONOR WILL

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:13.141
ACTUALLY- CONSTRUCT THE

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.776
BUILDING AND THEN GIFTED TO

01:30:14.842 --> 01:30:17.145
THE- TO THE UNIVERSITY SO

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.212
SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:19.947
EXAMPLES OF I DON'T TO DEVELOP

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:22.316
PROJECTS. YOU GOT IT THANK YOU.

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:24.152
I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT

01:30:24.218 --> 01:30:25.119
SOMEONE'S GIVING MONEY FOR A

01:30:25.186 --> 01:30:26.087
BUILDING AND I GET TO PARTAKE

01:30:26.154 --> 01:30:27.121
IN THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.656
ARE THEY DRIVING THE COST UP SO

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:30.358
MUCH. THAT IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:30.992
WORTH HAVING THAT DONOR

01:30:31.058 --> 01:30:32.293
INVOLVED IN THE- OF THE

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.694
CONSTRUCTION OF THAT FACILITY

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:34.662
THAT'S WHAT THAT'S ONE OF

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:35.696
THINGS THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:37.298
CLOSELY YEAH THANK I THINK THE

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:39.133
AND THERE AGAIN THAT'S FOR. THE

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.468
RESIDENTIAL HOUSING SITE AS

01:30:40.535 --> 01:30:42.503
WELL AS THE OTHER FACILITIES I

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:43.538
JUST LAST ONE HAS TO DO WITH

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.573
THE DESIGNED THIS BUILDING AND

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.408
UCSB APPARENTLY HAD NO WINDOWS.

01:30:47.475 --> 01:30:48.876
AND I BELIEVE THE STATE OF

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:50.244
CALIFORNIA AND PROBABLY.

01:30:50.311 --> 01:30:51.412
PROBABLY NONE OF THE LOCAL

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:55.817
LEVEL THROUGH BUILDING. CODES I

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:56.384
DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD A

01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.884
BUILDING. A RESIDENTIAL

01:30:56.951 --> 01:30:58.152
FACILITY WITHOUT WHEN. YEAH

01:30:58.219 --> 01:31:01.289
ONCE- VETERANS AN EXIT- I HOME

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:03.024
CAN'T DO THE- MIKE. RIGHT YOU

01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.091
KNOW HOME WINDOWS HAVE TO BE SO

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:06.160
EITHER HAVE TO BE SO MANY. PER

01:31:06.227 --> 01:31:07.795
SQUARE FOOTAGE OF A BEDROOM.

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:09.831
HOW WOULD IT BE THAT. A

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:11.199
RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX TO BE

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:12.934
DESIGNED WITHOUT ANY WINDOWS.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.801
WELL THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:14.969
WILL BE COMING THROUGH IN THE

01:31:15.036 --> 01:31:16.037
IN THE DESIGN PROCESS AND ONE

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:17.538
OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN-

01:31:17.605 --> 01:31:19.440
ALREADY. YOU KNOW CRITICIZED IN

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.641
IN SOME OF THE PRESS. IT

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:22.343
DOESN'T- YOU KNOW I TOWARD THE

01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:24.912
MOCK UP AS AS- J. MCCARTY I

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:29.784
DID. ITS THE- THE- THE BEDROOMS

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.118
HAVE NO WINDOWS IN THESE

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:33.087
VIRTUAL WINDOWS ARE. YOU KNOW

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.255
95% OF THEM HAVE VIRTUAL

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.090
WINDOWS. THE COMMON AREAS HAVE.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:39.327
HUGE WINDOWS SO IT'S- THE

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:40.728
NOTION OF THE DESIGN IS THAT

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.296
THE COMMON AREAS WHERE STUDENTS

01:31:42.363 --> 01:31:44.165
WOULD SPEND. MOST OF THEIR TIME

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.367
IN THOSE ARE ARE YOU KNOW HAVE-

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:49.237
AMPLE- LIGHT AND LOTS OF LOTS

01:31:49.303 --> 01:31:50.905
OF WINDOWS. BUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.240
MASSING OF THE BUILDINGS A LOT

01:31:52.306 --> 01:31:54.141
OF THE- BEDROOMS THEMSELVES ARE

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:56.310
INTERIOR. AND I GUESS IS THE UC

01:31:56.377 --> 01:32:00.414
COULD DO THAT BECAUSE- THEIR

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:01.048
STATE AGENCY THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:02.416
FOLLOW- LOCAL BUILDING. ARE WE

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.452
THOUGHT THE FOLLOWED. CODES IN.

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:05.086
TITLE TWENTY FOUR AND ALL THOSE

01:32:05.152 --> 01:32:07.255
THINGS SO. BUT WE KNOW WE

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:08.289
THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WILL

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.390
BE LOOKED AT- DURING THIS

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.826
PROCESS SO AS SOON I'M ASSUMING.

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:12.860
THE CITY OF SANTA BARBARA

01:32:12.927 --> 01:32:14.161
COUNTY SARAH BARNHAM WHATEVER

01:32:14.228 --> 01:32:16.664
MAYBE. DOESN'T HAVE AND I'M NOT

01:32:16.731 --> 01:32:17.498
ASKING YOU TO ANSWER THIS

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:18.366
QUESTION DOESN'T HAVE A

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.934

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:25.726
CARS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.027
TO LIVE ANYWHERE. CLOSE TO

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.195
CAMPUS SO THEY'RE LIVING IN A

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:31.432
COUPLE HOURS AWAY AND THEN-

01:39:31.498 --> 01:39:34.068
THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:37.604
JUST- SLEEPING IN THE CARS. SO

01:39:37.671 --> 01:39:39.006
I THINK I JUST WANT TO

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:41.575
REITERATE MY SUPPORT. FOR ALL

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:43.677
THE SEGMENTS TO REALLY. AS

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:45.846
AGGRESSIVELY AS POSSIBLE BUILD.

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:47.648
AS MUCH HOUSING IF THEY COULD

01:39:47.715 --> 01:39:49.683
DO I APPRECIATE THAT. THE

01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:50.984
DIALOGUE OF ALL THE LOCAL

01:39:51.051 --> 01:39:52.619
PLANNING CODES I THINK THAT IS

01:39:52.686 --> 01:39:54.588
VERY MUCH UP TO LOCAL

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:57.024
JURISDICTIONS WE HOPE THAT THE

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:59.193
PLANNING DOT. LOOK CAMPUSES CAN

01:39:59.259 --> 01:40:00.894
WORK WITH PLANNING DEPARTMENT

01:40:00.961 --> 01:40:02.096
PLANNING DEPARTMENTS IN CITIES

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.298
I KNOW THAT THAT BERKELEY WERE

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:05.632
WHERE YOU WERE AT THE SCENE A

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.667
LOT OF CONTENTION WITH CITY

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:08.068
FUND THAT'S BEEN ONGOING EVER

01:40:08.135 --> 01:40:09.770
SINCE I WAS A STUDENT THERE. SO

01:40:09.837 --> 01:40:10.871
I THINK IT IS IT IS VERY

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:13.273
IMPORTANT TO CAMPUSES HAVE A

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.808
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:16.377
LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUT- HAVING

01:40:16.443 --> 01:40:18.278
SAID THAT THIS IS DEFINITELY A

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:23.117
PRIORITY FOR US. WELL WE KNOW

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.752
THAT. WE CAN'T HAVE A- ROLE

01:40:24.818 --> 01:40:27.221
LOOKED WITHOUT A HOUSING- WE

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:28.288
KNOW THOSE HAND IN WITH THE

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:29.957
HEARD. WHAT HAPPENED SENATE TO

01:40:30.023 --> 01:40:35.729
USE AGO WHEN I IN. HE SAW. THE

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.798
CHANCELLOR DOUBLE SEND OUT THE-

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:39.333
ASK PEOPLE TO YOU KNOW CAN THE

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.434
PEOPLE PUT UP STUDENT AND

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:42.669
PEOPLE TO PEOPLE PUT. UP RIGHT.

01:40:42.736 --> 01:40:45.272
AND SO- THIS IS WHAT PRIORITY

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:46.540
IT'S THE THIS IS A LIFE THINK

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:47.174
IT'S NOW JUST MONEY THAT WE YOU

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.809
AN OF DISCUSS. SOMETHING THAT

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.577
IS COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR THE

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:54.214
SADNESS TO BUILD. HOUSING AND I

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:56.650
APPRECIATE THE TWENTY SEVEN

01:40:56.717 --> 01:40:57.418
THOUSAND UNITS THAT IS BEING

01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:58.952
BUILT OR BEING PLANNED OF THE

01:40:59.019 --> 01:41:01.722
NEXT FIVE YEARS. I WOULD HOPE.

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:03.657
THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.492
DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:08.495
DIFFERENT- CAMPUSES- PARTLY

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:10.798
BECAUSE- YOU'RE SOME CAMPUSES

01:41:10.864 --> 01:41:14.568
SAN DIEGO'S GET UCLA IRVINE-

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:15.569
DAVIS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT

01:41:15.636 --> 01:41:18.972
MORE AGGRESSIVE OTHERS ARE-

01:41:19.039 --> 01:41:20.441
YOU'RE STILL KIND OF LAGGING IN

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.842
TERMS OF SANTA CRUZ OR SANTA

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.944
BARBARA BERKELEY- OBVIOUSLY

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.179
MERCED THE BRAND NEW CAMPUS

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:27.014
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:27.681
BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:29.783
WOULD BE. EQUAL NUMBER OF

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.518
DIPLOMATIC DISTRIBUTION BUT

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:32.019
ALSO THAT SOME OF THESE

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:34.788
CAMPUSES. REALLY- CATCH UP

01:41:34.855 --> 01:41:36.457
BECAUSE WHERE THERE'S LESS

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:38.258
HOUSING ARE SOME OF THE MOST

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.760
IMPACTED AREAS WHICH IS SANTA

01:41:39.827 --> 01:41:41.395
CRUZ SANTA BARBARA IN BERKELEY-

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:42.996
PROBABLY THE- MOST DIFFICULT

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.765
PLACES FOR STUDENTS TO FIND OFF

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:49.002
CAMPUS HOUSING SO. I THINK IT

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.170
IS. YOU KNOW VERY IMPORTANT

01:41:50.237 --> 01:41:50.938
THING WITH WANT TO MAKE SURE WE

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:52.539
ARE. A SUPPORT THE CAMPUS IS

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.374
WHY WE THE SIX AND- THE

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:55.976
DIFFERENT CHEN COMPLY TO US.

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:56.777
BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT

01:41:56.844 --> 01:41:59.012
OF SUPPORT YOU ALL NEED TO GET

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:01.849
THIS. HOUSING BUILT BECAUSE WE

01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.750

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:14.695
HUGE ISSUE IN TERMS OF

01:42:14.761 --> 01:42:15.596
RECRUITING AND RETAINING AND

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.064
RETAINING. WE'VE GOT A GREAT

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.966

01:42:37.351 --> 01:42:39.520
CONTROL WHICH WAS A- HUGE WIN

01:42:39.586 --> 01:42:40.621

AND ALL THESE- IN ALL THESE

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:17.958

BECAUSE AS AS YOU SAID. WE'RE

01:43:42.816 --> 01:43:43.517

TWENTY THOUSAND MORE.

01:43:49.556 --> 01:43:51.858
CALIFORNIANS BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:43:51.925 --> 01:43:53.093
AND THAT'S THROUGH FUNDING THEM

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.628
THROUGH US WHICH THIS YEAR WE

01:43:54.695 --> 01:43:56.530

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:03.203
WEEKS I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.771
COMPLAINED WORK WE DID FIND

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:06.473
THESE NEW STUDENTS BUT AS YOU

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.040
KNOW ALL THE STUDENTS DON'T

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:08.809
COME UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO.

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:09.710
THERE'S NO REASON TO PUT MONEY

01:44:09.776 --> 01:44:10.744
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR

01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:11.645
STUDENTS ACTUALLY DON'T SELL

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:13.947
OUT. THERE YOURSELF. WE

01:44:14.014 --> 01:44:15.382
AUTHORIZE THOSE STUDENTS IN

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:16.817
THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND THE

01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:17.951
MONEY WILL BE THERE IN A FEW

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.987
WEEKS. IN THE GENERAL BUDGET

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:21.922
WILL WILL WILL WILL- RATIFIED

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:23.957
THAT WILL BE THERE. AT THE END

01:44:24.024 --> 01:44:25.559
OF JUNE TO FUND IS TO IS WHEN

01:44:25.626 --> 01:44:28.095
THEY COME INTO FALL TWENTY

01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:29.096
TWENTY BUT WE WITH MY NOSE

01:44:29.162 --> 01:44:30.497
MISTER. AND I WERE COULD MISTER

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:32.532
DRAKE TO COME TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:35.869
DEFINED AT LEAST. TWENTY

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:36.737
THOUSAND BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:44:36.803 --> 01:44:39.306
BECAUSE WE ALREADY FUNDED SIX.

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.207
SIX THOUSAND YEAH PLUS THIS

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:42.943
YEAR SO THAT'S WHAT. YOU KNOW

01:44:43.010 --> 01:44:44.144
FOURTEEN THOUSAND MORE TO GO.

01:44:44.211 --> 01:44:45.445
FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS AND I

01:44:45.512 --> 01:44:46.980
THOUGHT IN BUSINESS OR NOT YOU

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.582
KNOW WE WANT TO FIND AT LEAST

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:49.783
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. PER YEAR

01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:51.118
SO I THINK THAT NUMBER SHOULD

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.285
BE BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:54.021
THOUSAND. NEW SLOTS FOR

01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:56.123
CALIFORNIANS AND SO THIS. GOES

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.791
HAND IN HAND TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:57.858 --> 01:44:58.692
THEIR WORKING HOURS FOR THE

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.327
HOUSING SO THAT HOUSING YES SO

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.062
WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE ARE TOTAL

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.263
SUPPORT TO MAKE SURE WE DO THEM

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:08.835
BOTH. IT'S TO EXPAND ACCESS

01:45:08.902 --> 01:45:10.270
YEAH YOU JUST REPORT REAL QUICK

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:13.073
KANA WHERE THISGOES IS. TODAY

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.074
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TO UC'S THAT

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:15.709
HAVE AGREEMENTS WHY SHOULD NEXT

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.644
YEAR ALL OF THEM WHY SHOULDN'T

01:45:17.711 --> 01:45:18.612
CSU IS WHY SHOULDN'T COMMUNITY

01:45:18.679 --> 01:45:20.280
COLLEGES. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:22.015
THIS THAT THIS COULD GO. SO I

01:45:22.082 --> 01:45:23.483
THINK GIVING INDIVIDUAL

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:25.519
UNIVERSITIES THE AUTHORITY. TO

01:45:25.585 --> 01:45:27.754
SAY HEY ARMAMENTS CAT UNLESS WE

BUILD NEW HOUSING UNITS- CAN

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.191
HAVE SOME UNINTENDED

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:34.027
CONSEQUENCES. AND I GET THAT.

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.262
PLACES LIKE YOU SEE GRANTED

01:45:35.328 --> 01:45:36.530
SANTA CRUZ ACCEPT OR THEY MIGHT

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:38.198
NOT GROW LIKE GROWTH. BUT THE

01:45:38.265 --> 01:45:39.066
FACT OF THE MATTER IS

01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:40.934
COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA HAVE TO

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:41.501
GROW THEY HAVE TO GET THEIR

01:45:41.568 --> 01:45:42.736
RAIN AND NUMBER SIX ADDRESS.

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:44.337
AND YOU SAY WELL WE'RE OUT

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:46.306
UNLESS YOU GIVE US MORE MONEY

01:45:46.373 --> 01:45:49.509
FOR HOUSING IS AN ACCEPTABLE TO

01:45:49.576 --> 01:45:50.911
ME. BUT AGAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:52.145
IN THIS ROOM I WORKED HARD ON

THIS WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE HOW

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:04.678
THE UC'S RESPOND TO THIS. AND I

THINK THERE WILL BE LESSONS

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:08.181
LEARNED FROM THE FIRST FROM THE

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:10.383
FROM THE DONOR BECAUSE THAT'S

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:11.751
JUST ONE DONOR WILL HAVE MANY

01:48:11.818 --> 01:48:13.987
OTHERS IN THE FUTURE AND GOING

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:15.755
BACK TO MR MEDINA SO TO MY

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:17.891
COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE- HIS

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:19.960
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE-

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:24.264
CONTRIBUTION- WAS CONDITIONAL-

01:48:24.331 --> 01:48:26.099
ON ON MAKING SURE THAT THEIR

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:29.469
PLANS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

01:48:29.536 --> 01:48:30.737
IMPLEMENTED. AT IT I HEAR YOU

01:48:30.804 --> 01:48:31.738
SAYING THAT THAT WASN'T A

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:33.907
CONDITION AND IF IT WAS

01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:34.941
CERTAINLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:48:35.008 --> 01:48:36.309
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT IN THE

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.245
FUTURE BECAUSE BY THE TIME YOU

01:48:38.311 --> 01:48:39.846
FIGURE OUT. WHETHER OR NOT

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:40.580
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:40.647 --> 01:48:41.982
COMPLY WITH THAT CONDITION THE

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:43.650
UC'S ALREADY SPENT ENORMOUS

01:48:43.717 --> 01:48:45.452
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY TRYING

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:47.220
TO PUT TOGETHER PLANS. TO

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:48.922
FIGURE OUT IF THEY MEET THAT

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:51.391
CONDITION BUT I THINK. KNOWING

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:53.226
THAT WE ARE SETTING A PRECEDENT

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:55.462
IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT HAPPENS

01:48:55.528 --> 01:48:57.297
ON THIS UC CAMPUS IS EXTREMELY

01:48:57.364 --> 01:49:00.433
IMPORTANT. FOR THE FUTURE- SO

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:03.136
JUST WANTED TO. TO MAKE THAT

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:05.739
COMMENT THE OTHER IS REGARDING-

01:49:05.805 --> 01:49:06.873
EACH OF THE CAMPUSES MAKING

01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:09.175
SURE THAT ALL THE CAMPUSES HAVE

01:49:09.242 --> 01:49:10.977
THE SAME AMOUNT OF HOUSING

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:13.580
OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK THAT MAY

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:15.749
NOT WORK ON EVERY CAMPUS

01:49:15.815 --> 01:49:16.750
BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE NOT THE

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:19.219
SAME. ARE THERE SOME CAMPUSES

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.554
THAT DO REQUIRE MORE- STUDENT

01:49:21.621 --> 01:49:24.190
HOUSING. UP CLOSE TO CAMPUS

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:28.628
OTHERS THE AVAILABILITY IS-

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:30.096
THERE'S GREATER AVAILABILITY

01:49:30.163 --> 01:49:31.998
AVAILABILITY YEAH. I WOULD ALSO

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:33.500
KNOW JUST WHAT THAT YOU'RE

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:34.668
MCCARTY WAS SAYING EARLIER IS

01:49:34.734 --> 01:49:35.769
THAT THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NON

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.304
FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM OUR

01:49:37.370 --> 01:49:39.906
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS- YOU KNOW WE

01:49:39.973 --> 01:49:42.442
HAD A STUDY DONE IT. UC MERCED

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.444
IF A STUDENT WAS THERE LIVING

01:49:44.511 --> 01:49:45.545
ON CAMPUS FRESHMAN YEAR THEIR

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.113
GRADUATION RATE WENT UP ABOUT

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:49.516
TWENTY PERCENT. AND THEY DO YOU

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:50.817

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.621
SURE THAT. STUDENTS NOT ONLY

01:49:54.688 --> 01:49:55.789
COME TO THE CAMPUSES BUT ALSO

01:49:55.855 --> 01:49:59.559
CONTINUE- AND PERSIST AND ON

01:49:59.626 --> 01:50:00.760
CAMPUS HOUSING IS ONE OF THE

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.595
BEST. PREDICTORS OF THAT SO

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:03.630
IT'S ANOTHER REASON THAT WE

01:50:03.697 --> 01:50:05.765
SUPPORT MORE HOUSING ON CAMPUS.

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:07.334

01:53:23.663 --> 01:53:24.063
FOR THE PROGRAM IS THE

01:53:24.130 --> 01:53:26.399

AFFORDABILITY FOR OUR STUDENTS.

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:34.066
THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY TO

AND YOU CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:44.310
WAYS TO POTENTIALLY ENHANCE THE

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:47.246
THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER ONE

IDEA FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:50.016
ENSURE MCCARTY I THINK THIS

01:59:50.082 --> 01:59:52.351
GUEST YOUR EARLIER QUESTION OF

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:54.220
THE ALEJO. GAP FINANCING. S.

01:59:54.287 --> 01:59:55.955
PRESENTLY ENVISIONED THE HIGHER

01:59:56.022 --> 01:59:57.023
EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT

01:59:57.089 --> 01:59:59.926
PROGRAM SEEKS TO PROVIDE 1100%

01:59:59.992 --> 02:00:01.227
OF THE FUNDING FOR A HOUSING

02:00:01.294 --> 02:00:02.762
PROJECT. AND CERTAINLY THIS

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:03.896
APPROACH WILL PROVIDE

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:05.531
CONSIDERABLE AFFORDABILITY FOR

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:08.367
MANY STUDENTS. HOWEVER IF THERE

02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:10.036

02:00:10.102 --> 02:00:11.604
GRANT PROGRAM TO WORK IN

02:00:11.671 --> 02:00:13.339
COMBINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA

STATE UNIVERSITIES RECESSED MY

02:00:14.540 --> 02:00:16.475
REVENUE BOND PROGRAM. WE THINK

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.411
THE POTENTIAL EXISTS TO A

02:00:18.477 --> 02:00:20.012
GREATER IMPACT BY COMBINING THE

WITH THE STRENGTHS OF OUR

02:00:23.082 --> 02:00:24.650
SYSTEM MY REVENUE BND PROGRAM.

02:00:24.717 --> 02:00:26.218
THE IDEA WOULD BE TO UTILIZE

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:28.387
CRAP DOLLARS AS A DOWN PAYMENT

02:00:28.454 --> 02:00:30.156

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:34.360
SYSTEM I REVENUE BOND DEBT. BY

02:00:34.427 --> 02:00:35.261
LOWERING THE LEVEL OF THE

02:00:35.328 --> 02:00:36.729
PROJECT DEBT SERVICE WHICH IS A

02:00:36.796 --> 02:00:37.997
FIXED EXPENDITURE A

02:00:38.064 --> 02:00:39.098
CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN

STUDENTS. THE AMOUNT OF THE

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:45.438
DOWN PAYMENT WOULD BE BURIED

02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:46.806
DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE

02:00:46.872 --> 02:00:47.773
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL

02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.508
PROJECT. BUT THE CONCEPT WOULD

02:00:49.575 --> 02:00:51.344
SPREAD THE GRANT DOLLARS OVER A

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.179
LARGER NUMBER OF PROJECTS.

02:00:53.245 --> 02:00:54.513
THEREBY POTENTIALLY PROVIDING

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:56.382

THIS KIND OF NOTION OF A OF A

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:45.591
REVOLVING FUND. OR BOTH IT WAS

WHO WHICH SHOULD BE. WHAT ARE

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:49.595
THE TOP THINGS THAT WE COULD DO

02:02:49.662 --> 02:02:51.330
FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVES.

02:02:51.397 --> 02:02:54.266
THE FOCUS ON AND YOUR STUDENT

02:02:54.333 --> 02:02:54.867
HOUSING PRIORITIES AT THE CSU

02:02:54.934 --> 02:03:01.273
SYSTEM. WELL I WOULD SAY AS I

02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:02.608

YOU WILL IS THE FINANCIAL

02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:13.986
VIABILITY OF A PROJECT BASED ON

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:15.154
THE REVENUES YOU CAN OCCUR IN

02:03:15.221 --> 02:03:16.789
THE EXPENSE DOESN'T DEBT

02:03:16.856 --> 02:03:19.191
SERVICE AND AFFORDABILITY SO I

02:03:19.258 --> 02:03:20.593
THINK THE VALUE OF THESE

02:03:20.659 --> 02:03:23.529
PROGRAMS THE GRANT PROGRAM AS

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:26.065

FUND A PROGRAM. IS THAT IT

02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:31.203
COULD IMPACT THE AFFORDABILITY.

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:33.172
IT COULD PROVIDE IF YOU WILL

02:03:33.239 --> 02:03:34.573
EIGHT A SUBSIDY OR A DOWN

02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:35.975
PAYMENT OF SOME SORTS THAT CAN

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:38.010
LOWER KIND OF FIXED COSTS THE

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:40.179
CASE NUMBER OF ALL THE FUN- YOU

02:03:40.246 --> 02:03:42.348
KNOW THIS- THE UC'S MISTER

02:03:42.414 --> 02:03:44.216
BREWSTER NOTED YOU KNOW

02:03:44.283 --> 02:03:45.184
SOMETHING THAT 0% OBVIOUSLY

02:03:45.251 --> 02:03:47.686
WOULD BE WELCOME WE ARE A BET

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:49.688
AND THAT FROM LOW COST CAPITAL.

02:03:49.755 --> 02:03:51.924
SO THE INTEREST RATE I WOULD

02:03:51.991 --> 02:03:53.492
NEED TO BE LOWER TO TRACK OF

02:03:53.559 --> 02:03:55.027
SPORTS BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY

02:03:55.094 --> 02:03:56.996

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:58.631
THE GRANT PROGRAM YEAH IDEAS BE

02:03:58.697 --> 02:04:00.099
BY DOWN THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT

02:04:00.166 --> 02:04:01.734
AS THE L. A. O. SAID IT'S

02:04:01.801 --> 02:04:03.068
FAVORABLE TERMS IN THE SENSE

02:04:03.135 --> 02:04:04.336
IT'S REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE

02:04:04.403 --> 02:04:05.271
DEBT SERVICE IT NEEDS TO BE

02:04:05.337 --> 02:04:09.909
CARRIED CITING BOTH. BOTH

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:11.243
PROGRAMS HAVE MERIT. OKAY THANK

ON THAT ALSO. FOR WHERE THE

02:04:15.548 --> 02:04:17.550
LOCAL MARKET IS ABLE TO HAVE

02:04:17.616 --> 02:04:19.718
SUCH LOW RENTS COMPARED TO WHAT

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.387
THE UNIVERSITY HAS. THAT WOULD

02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:23.689
BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

02:04:23.756 --> 02:04:25.491
ESPECIALLY IF WE HAD EXISTING

02:04:25.558 --> 02:04:29.795
CAPACITY- WHETHER IT'S- NOT

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:30.329
REAL CAPACITY BECAUSE FOR

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:33.032
SOCIAL DISTANCING. IF IT IF THE

02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:34.567
USE OF STUDENT HOUSING IS DOWN

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:35.801
BECAUSE OF PRICING BECAUSE THEY

02:04:35.868 --> 02:04:37.369
CAN FIND THINGS IN THE LOCAL

02:04:37.436 --> 02:04:40.005
COMMUNITY. THAN SOME OTHER

02:04:40.072 --> 02:04:43.242
STRUCTURE COULD BE HELPFUL.

02:04:43.309 --> 02:04:45.911

PEOPLE TO GET MORE HOUSING

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:04.797
BUILT. I THINK THE POTENTIALLY

02:05:04.864 --> 02:05:06.432
I THINK IT'D BE MORE FOCUSED ON

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:07.800
AFFORDABILITY AND THEN OF

02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:09.301
COURSE AND THAT COULD

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:09.935
POTENTIALLY TRANSLATE INTO MORE

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:13.839
HOUSING- IF YOU IF YOU THINK

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:17.443

YOUR GOALS. PERHAPS TEN OR

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.491
TWENTY MILLION. MIGHT MEET THAT

02:05:32.558 --> 02:05:33.893
AFFORDABILITY TARGET WHICH CASE

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:36.328
YOU CAN FREE UP THE OTHER

TO THE EXTENT THAT

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:42.201
AFFORDABILITY IS ONE OF THESE

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:44.403
CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WE'RE

02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:45.738
LOOKING AT A PROJECT DOESN'T

AT FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE

02:05:48.807 --> 02:05:50.843
PROJECT WITH A FOUR BUILDING

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:52.478
FOR STUDENTS. ANY DOLLAR THEY

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:53.712

02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:56.916
OF AFFORDABLE PROJECT AND

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:59.184
THEREFORE- POTENTIALLY COULD

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:01.387
RESULT IN MORE PROJECTS. SO

02:06:01.453 --> 02:06:02.755
WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:06:02.821 --> 02:06:05.424
IS RATHER THAN HAVE- ALL THE

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:06.659
MONEY IS STILL FIFTY MILLION

02:06:06.725 --> 02:06:08.394
BEFORE COSTS ON ONE PROJECT CA

THAT THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:13.933
PROJECTS WHICH WOULD PRODUCE.

02:06:13.999 --> 02:06:15.567
THE COST AT ALL THOSE PROJECTS

02:06:15.634 --> 02:06:17.069
NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIFTY

02:06:17.136 --> 02:06:17.836
MILLION ONE PROJECT BUT

02:06:17.903 --> 02:06:20.205
OBVIOUSLY YOU WOULD SPREAD THAT

02:06:20.272 --> 02:06:21.674
AFFORDABILITY. A NUMBER OF

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.708
DIFFERENT PROJECTS IS THAT WHAT

02:06:22.775 --> 02:06:24.343
YOU'RE SUGGESTING. YEAH EXACTLY

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.145
AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT WHICH

02:06:26.211 --> 02:06:28.380
VARY BY PROJECT AND

02:06:28.447 --> 02:06:30.316
CIRCUMSTANCE. WE LOOK AT

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:33.485
POTENTIAL IS THERE YES GOTTEN.

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:34.653
JUST QUESTION FOR SYSTEM CHANCE

02:06:34.720 --> 02:06:36.655
ONCE YOU ADVANCE ON. THE

02:06:36.722 --> 02:06:39.692
FLEXIBILITY TO INCLUDE-

02:06:39.758 --> 02:06:41.327
RENOVATION PROJECTS I DID HAVE

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:43.162
A QUESTION WHICH IS. HOW

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:44.930
TRADITIONALLY RENOVATION

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:46.765

MAIN INTEREST EARNERS WHICH YOU

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:49.301
JUST MENTIONED DESERVE REASON

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.803
WHY THERE AREN'T. ADEQUATE

02:06:50.869 --> 02:06:54.206
RESERVES TO DO THE RENOVATION

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:54.773

HOUSING PROJECTS. FOR SOMEOF

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:57.776
THE PROJECTS THEY'RE QUITE

02:06:57.843 --> 02:07:00.412
EXPENSIVE YES STILL EIGHTY TO A

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:02.381
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SO THE

02:07:02.448 --> 02:07:04.350
RESERVES WERE HIT PRETTY HARD

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.018
WITH CODED EVEN WITH THE

02:07:06.085 --> 02:07:08.287
FEDERAL FUNDING- THEY'VE BEEN

02:07:08.354 --> 02:07:10.889
IT'S BEEN PROVED BUT- FOR ONE

02:07:10.956 --> 02:07:12.491
PROJECT TO TAKE ON A EIGHTEEN

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:14.093
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS

02:07:14.159 --> 02:07:15.961
RECLINERS SERVICES DIFFICULT.

02:07:16.028 --> 02:07:18.430
GONE AND THEN WE DO YEAH. WE DO

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:19.965
ENCOURAGE THEM TO USE RESERVES

02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:21.433
TO HELP BUY DOWN THE DEBT IF

02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.770
THERE IS A ISSUE WITH THAT WHAT

02:07:24.837 --> 02:07:26.505
THEY CAN AFFORD. IN TERMS OF A

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:29.341
THE ADDITIONAL BED PER. PER

02:07:29.408 --> 02:07:31.377
DOLLAR INVESTED- WOULD BE

02:07:31.443 --> 02:07:32.878
CHEAPER TO DO RENOVATION

02:07:32.945 --> 02:07:34.713
PROJECTS RATHER THAN TO DO NEW

02:07:34.780 --> 02:07:35.247
CONSTRUCTION IS THAT WHAT

02:07:35.314 --> 02:07:37.416

02:20:38.062 --> 02:20:39.397
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY GOING

02:20:39.464 --> 02:20:40.665
TOWARD PLANNING WITH NO.

02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:45.270
CONSTRUCTION. YEAH I HAVE BEEN

02:20:45.336 --> 02:20:47.071
ADDRESSED THAT. AS I MENTIONED

02:20:47.138 --> 02:20:48.373
OUR COLLEGES ARE CURRENTLY IN

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:51.075
EARLY STAGES OF ENGAGING IN

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:53.278
HOUSING IS A NEW VENTURE SO

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:54.445
MANY OF THEM HAVE TAKEN AN

02:20:54.512 --> 02:20:58.683
pNEEDS HOW THEY CAN UTILIZE THE

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:02.353
LAND- AND HOW TO CONSTRUCT IN A

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.222
MANNER. THAT MAINTAINS

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:06.124
AFFORDABILITY SO THAT THEY CAN

02:21:06.191 --> 02:21:09.027
CANCEL OUT THESE COSTS- THIS

02:21:09.093 --> 02:21:11.095
WILL GIVE US. AND THE

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.630
LEGISLATURE IN THE DEPARTMENT

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:15.700
FINANCE. GOOD LANDSCAPE OF WHAT

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:17.202
IS OUT THERE WHAT IT WILL TAKE

02:21:17.268 --> 02:21:18.970
FOR A LONG TERM INVESTMENT THIS

02:21:19.037 --> 02:21:20.672
SOAK YOU CAN STRUCTURE

02:21:20.738 --> 02:21:22.273
STRUCTURE THIS IS FOCUS ON

02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:24.075
FIRST FUNDING THOSE THAT ARE

02:21:24.142 --> 02:21:26.077
SHOVEL READY. BUT THE

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:27.645
INFORMATION THAT COMES IN FROM

02:21:27.712 --> 02:21:29.314
THOSE PLANNING RANTS REALLY CAN

02:21:29.380 --> 02:21:31.015
HELP BUILD OUT THAT LONG TERM

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:34.752
PROGRAMS THAT THEN- A GIVES US

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:37.021
LEEWAY TO SEE HOW MUCH MORE THE

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:38.957
STATE COULD NOT EAT. IN SETTING

02:21:39.023 --> 02:21:40.558
GOALS FOR AFFORDABILITY AND

02:21:40.625 --> 02:21:42.160
LONG TERM CONSTRUCTION

02:21:42.227 --> 02:21:44.028

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:46.097
COMMITMENT TO THE ONE BILLION-

02:21:46.164 --> 02:21:49.100
INCLUDED IN SB ONE SIX NINE OR

02:21:49.167 --> 02:21:51.369
ALSO- IN TANDEM BUILDING

02:21:51.436 --> 02:21:55.640
POTENTIALLY. A REVOLVING LOAN

02:21:55.707 --> 02:22:00.078
IN THE FUTURE. OKAY I DON'T

02:22:00.144 --> 02:22:01.179
THINK I GOT AN ANSWER TO MY

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:02.914
QUESTION LET ME JUST RESTATE IT

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:06.050
SO ON. YOU HAVE SEVENTY ONE

02:22:06.117 --> 02:22:09.687
APPLICANTS ASKING. FOR THREE

02:22:09.754 --> 02:22:10.221
HUNDRED THIRTEEN. MILLION

02:22:10.288 --> 02:22:13.691
DOLLARS IS THERE A CHEAPER MORE

02:22:13.758 --> 02:22:16.427
EFFICIENT WAY TO HELP THE

02:22:16.494 --> 02:22:18.529
SEVENTY ONE INSTITUTIONS. WITH

02:22:18.596 --> 02:22:20.632
THEIR PLANNING WHAT DO YOU

02:22:20.698 --> 02:22:22.200
REALLY EXPECT THE STATE TO KICK

02:22:22.267 --> 02:22:23.668
IN THREE HUNDRED MILLION

02:22:23.735 --> 02:22:26.304
DOLLARS TO. HELP THESE CAMPUSES

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.239
PLAN WITH NOT A SINGLE UNIT

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:37.215
BEING BUILT. ONE APPROACH THAT

02:22:37.282 --> 02:22:39.450
AT GREATER SYSTEM WIDE

02:22:39.517 --> 02:22:40.585
STRUCTURE THAT CAN HELP

02:22:40.652 --> 02:22:43.955
COLLEGES BUILD UP PLANS FOR

02:22:44.022 --> 02:22:45.657
HOUSING AND THEY CAN PROVIDE

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:48.960
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT CAN-

02:22:49.027 --> 02:22:51.829
BUILD THESE LONG TERM PLANS

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:53.665
INTEGRATED INTO THE FACILITIES

02:22:53.731 --> 02:22:55.667
MASTER PLAN PART OF A SYSTEM.

02:22:55.733 --> 02:22:58.937
AND SO THAT WORK AND THEN-

02:22:59.003 --> 02:23:01.272
SUPPORT AND REDUCE THE COSTS

02:23:01.339 --> 02:23:04.375
NEEDED FOR PLANNING GRANTS- AND

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:07.812
THEN FOCUS ON CONSTRUCTION FOR

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.414
THESE SYSTEMS. I THINK THAT'S A

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:10.748
GREAT IDEA I MEAN IT'S MY HOPE

02:23:10.815 --> 02:23:13.051
IS THAT YOUR OFFICE COULD WORK

02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:15.119
WITH THE SEVENTY ONE CAMPUSES

02:23:15.186 --> 02:23:17.622
TO REALLY. FIND A WAY TO BE

02:23:17.689 --> 02:23:18.690
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT REGARDING

02:23:18.756 --> 02:23:21.693
THE- PLANNING BECAUSE WE WOULD

02:23:21.759 --> 02:23:23.628
RATHER HAVE THIS MONEY GO TO

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:25.997
CONSTRUCTION RATHER THAN. THE

02:23:26.064 --> 02:23:27.899
IDEA OF CONSTRUCTION WITH THE

02:23:27.966 --> 02:23:29.067
PLANNING OF CONSTRUCTION WITH

02:23:29.133 --> 02:23:30.935
NOT A SINGLE UNIT BEING BUILT.

02:23:31.002 --> 02:23:32.937
ON WE DID SEE TWENTY ONE

02:23:33.004 --> 02:23:35.974
CAMPUSES APPLY FOR THE FUNDS

02:23:36.040 --> 02:23:36.541
WHICH IS VERY EXCITING COULD

02:23:36.607 --> 02:23:37.408
YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF.

02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:38.476
WITH THIS TWENTY ONE CAMPUSES

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:40.311
ARE LOCATED WAS IT FAIRLY WELL

02:23:40.378 --> 02:23:42.480
DISTRIBUTED WAS IT. MORE URBAN

02:23:42.547 --> 02:23:45.049
VERSUS RULE OR CAN YOU JUST

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.185
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THE-

02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:50.688
WHO THIS TWENTY CAMPUSES ARE.

02:23:50.755 --> 02:23:52.757
YEAH WE CURRENTLY HAVE A WIDE

02:23:52.824 --> 02:23:55.059
DISPERSION COLLEGES THAT WERE

02:23:56.794 --> 02:23:59.297
CONSTRUCTION. SOME OF THESE ARE

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:02.000
AND- REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:24:02.066 --> 02:24:04.002
AFFECTED BY FIRES AND THEY HAVE

02:24:04.068 --> 02:24:05.603

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:08.139
SEVERELY REDUCED LOSSES SEEN

02:24:08.206 --> 02:24:10.608
OTHER PROJECTS IN URBAN AREAS

02:24:10.675 --> 02:24:12.076
THAT ARE DEALING WITH DENSITY

02:24:12.143 --> 02:24:14.879
ISSUES OR AFFORDABILITY ISSUES

02:24:14.946 --> 02:24:16.981
AND- THAT LEVERAGING STATE

02:24:17.048 --> 02:24:18.950
DOLLARS CAN KEEP THE COSTS

02:24:19.017 --> 02:24:20.918
DOWN. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME

02:24:20.985 --> 02:24:23.154
THAT ARE IN SUBURBAN AREAS-

02:24:23.221 --> 02:24:25.857
THAT ARE UTILIZING SPACE AND

02:24:25.923 --> 02:24:29.327
MORE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AS

02:24:29.394 --> 02:24:29.927

PARTNERSHIPS SO AS YOU CAN SEE

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:36.134
THE DIVERSITY OF THE- PROJECT

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.935
BECAUSE MY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

SYSTEM OFFICE HAS A GREATER

02:25:02.026 --> 02:25:05.329

COST OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY

02:45:47.771 --> 02:45:50.040

PRICE. AND THIS PROBLEM HAS

02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:23.973

THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST

02:46:35.518 --> 02:46:37.554
PERCENTAGES IN THE UC AND CSU

02:46:37.620 --> 02:46:39.656
SYSTEMS AND- WE'RE MOVING DIRT

02:46:39.723 --> 02:46:41.024
RIGHT NOW ON A PROJECT THAT

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:43.226

HUNDRED BETS. AT ONE OF OUR TEN

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:46.696

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:24.367
THE COMMUNITY. THIS DECISION IS

02:47:24.434 --> 02:47:26.536
NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO CAP

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:27.904

STATE'S ENROLLMENT GOALS. IT'S

02:47:36.079 --> 02:47:37.380
ALSO MEANT TO REDUCE THE

02:47:37.447 --> 02:47:39.582
CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD LIKELY

02:47:39.649 --> 02:47:40.450

02:49:44.841 --> 02:49:46.142
THE PROJECT UNDERWENT A

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:49.012
THOROUGH ANALYSIS UNDER SCORING

02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:49.979
THE CAMPUS IS COMMITMENT TO THE

02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:51.814
ENVIRONMENT. THE JUDGE DIDN'T

02:49:51.881 --> 02:49:54.484
FIND ANY ISSUES WITH THAT YEAH

02:49:54.551 --> 02:49:56.953
I ARE. BUT DID IDENTIFY SOME

02:49:57.020 --> 02:50:00.089
FOR FREE PROCEDURAL ISSUES WITH

02:50:00.156 --> 02:50:01.257
THE RICH GENTLE APPROVAL. THIS

02:50:01.324 --> 02:50:03.092
PROCEDURAL MATTER HAS SINCE

02:50:03.159 --> 02:50:05.161
BEEN CORRECTED. BUT OPPONENTS

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:06.796
CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE

02:50:06.863 --> 02:50:09.098
PROJECT IN COURT. DELAYS THAT

02:50:09.165 --> 02:50:11.367
SIGNIFICANTLY ADD EXPENSES TO

02:50:11.434 --> 02:50:14.571
THE PROJECT. UC SANTA CRUZ HAS

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:15.638
BEEN A CHAMPION FOR

02:50:15.705 --> 02:50:17.307
ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP AND

02:50:17.373 --> 02:50:19.309
JUSTICE CENTS ARE FOUND. AND I

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:21.711
BELIEVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AT

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:23.012
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL

02:50:23.079 --> 02:50:25.281
QUALITY ACT SEQUEL IS ESSENTIAL

02:50:25.348 --> 02:50:26.683
FOR ENSURING THAT PROJECTS AND

02:50:26.749 --> 02:50:27.517
DEVELOPMENTS ARE

02:50:27.584 --> 02:50:30.353
ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE AND

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:30.887
DON'T POSE A THREAT TO THE

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:33.289
ENVIRONMENT. SIX HAS BEEN IN

02:50:33.356 --> 02:50:34.657
THE FIFTY YEARS SINCE SAID THAT

02:50:34.724 --> 02:50:36.793
ITS ENACTMENT A FORCE FOR GOOD

02:50:36.859 --> 02:50:38.361
IN CALIFORNIA AND MAINTAINING

02:50:38.428 --> 02:50:40.063
ITS INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS

02:50:40.129 --> 02:50:42.065
IS IMPORTANT. THE PUBLIC'S

02:50:42.131 --> 02:50:43.533
ABILITY TO CHALLENGE AN

02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:45.568
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF FORMED

02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:48.404
BY A PUBLIC AGENCY IS ESSENTIAL

02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:50.707
TO WAS EFFECTIVENESS. BUT THAT

02:50:50.773 --> 02:50:51.908
DOESN'T MEAN THAT SEQUEL

02:50:51.975 --> 02:50:54.043
COULDN'T BE IMPROVED. IN MY

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:56.045
EXPERIENCE SEEK BUT CAN BE USED

02:50:56.112 --> 02:50:58.381
BY OPPONENTS TO SERIOUSLY DELAY

02:50:58.448 --> 02:51:00.149
OTHERWISE GOOD NEEDED AND

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:02.018

HOUSING WEST PROJECT. THIS

02:51:05.788 --> 02:51:08.024
ULTIMATELY RAISES PROJECT COSTS

02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:09.292
AND INHIBITS OUR EFFORTS TO

02:51:09.359 --> 02:51:11.060

MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOALS WE CAN

WHAT HOW WE COULD HELP YOUR JOB

02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:02.632
TAKE YOUR CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR

02:54:02.698 --> 02:54:04.500
ALSO OTHER CAMPUSES ARE IN.

02:54:04.567 --> 02:54:06.936
VERY IMPACTED AREAS BUT ALSO IN

02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:09.705
IN AREAS WHERE THE COMMUNITIES

02:54:09.772 --> 02:54:12.542
GENERALLY ARE POSING ANY KIND

02:54:12.608 --> 02:54:15.378
OF DEVELOPMENT. WELL SO I ONE

02:54:15.444 --> 02:54:17.847
OF THE REASONS THAT THAT WE AS

02:54:17.914 --> 02:54:18.981
PART OF OUR LONG RANGE

02:54:19.048 --> 02:54:20.850
DEVELOPMENT PLAN OUT HAD

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:22.585
PROMISED A HOUSE A 100% OF OUR

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:25.054
NEW ENROLLMENT. IT'S TO HELP

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:27.323
MITIGATE THAT THE CONCERNS OF

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:30.092
OUR CITY AND COUNTY ABOUT THE

02:54:30.159 --> 02:54:32.795
IMPACTS O STUDENTS. ARE

02:54:32.862 --> 02:54:34.831
ALREADY TIGHT HOUSING MARKET.

02:54:34.897 --> 02:54:37.700
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS

02:54:37.767 --> 02:54:39.635
THAT YOU KNOW THAT IS OURS ONE

02:54:39.702 --> 02:54:43.506
OF OUR STRATEGIES UP I I'M NOT.

02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:47.009
A LAWYER AND SO I THINK THAT IF

02:54:47.076 --> 02:54:48.711
WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SECRET

02:54:48.778 --> 02:54:50.880
STRATEGIES IT BETTER TO HAVE

02:54:50.947 --> 02:54:52.648
THE LEGISLATOR CHAIR AND THE

02:54:52.715 --> 02:54:53.783
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WORK

02:54:53.850 --> 02:54:55.952
TOGETHER. TO DEVISE SOME POLICY

02:54:56.018 --> 02:54:57.753
STRATEGY THAT COULD BALANCE THE

02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:00.256
GOALS FOR. PROJECTIONS AND

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:03.092
STUDENT HOUSING. I THINK THAT

02:55:03.159 --> 02:55:05.628
IN TERMS OF OUR CAMP. AND IN

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:07.029
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CITY

02:55:07.096 --> 02:55:08.798
AND THE COUNTY DOES DOES NOT

02:55:08.865 --> 02:55:11.033
HAVE HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED I

02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:12.134
THINK OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:14.370
YEARS. OF MANY OF OUR CITY AND

02:55:14.437 --> 02:55:15.738
COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE

02:55:15.805 --> 02:55:17.273
SUPPORTIVE OF BUILDING MORE

02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:19.075
CAMPUS HOUSING BECAUSE THAT

02:55:19.141 --> 02:55:21.110
WILL REDUCE OF THE DEMANDS ON

02:55:21.177 --> 02:55:23.746
THE COMMUNITY. BUT THERE WILL

02:55:23.813 --> 02:55:26.716
BE THOSE WHO WILL FILE LEGAL

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:28.618
CHALLENGES ROUTE REALLY

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:30.486
REGARDLESS OF THE PROJECT I

02:55:30.553 --> 02:55:31.821
THINK REGARDLESS OF THE

02:55:31.888 --> 02:55:33.856
BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY SO.

02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:37.860
THAT'S PART OF THE CHALLENGE

02:55:37.927 --> 02:55:38.895
THAT THAT WE FACE IN SANTA CRUZ.

02:55:38.961 --> 02:55:39.695
IN SUCH AS RESULT A COME

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:42.331
COLLEAGUE- MISTER DONALD-

02:55:42.398 --> 02:55:44.333
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ENTER INTO

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.202
AN AGREEMENT TO BUILD HOUSING

02:55:46.269 --> 02:55:48.204
FOR. INCREASED ENROLLMENT

02:55:48.271 --> 02:55:50.439
BECAUSE- BASICALLY YOU'VE BEEN

02:55:50.506 --> 02:55:52.441
UNABLE TO BUILD HOUSING DOES

02:55:52.508 --> 02:55:54.977
THAT IN ESSENCE A FORCE YOU TO

02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:56.512
CAP YOUR ENROLLMENT BECAUSE OF

02:55:56.579 --> 02:55:58.414
YOUR INABILITY TO BUILD.

02:55:58.481 --> 02:55:59.815
HOUSING DUE TO LOCAL

02:55:59.882 --> 02:56:02.919
COMMUNITIES ISSUE. H. NO I

02:56:02.985 --> 02:56:05.755
DON'T THINK SO I THINK THAT-

02:56:05.821 --> 02:56:07.556
IT'S DELAYS OUR ABILITY

02:56:07.623 --> 02:56:09.959
PALESTINIANS SO WHAT WHAT WE

02:56:10.026 --> 02:56:11.894
HAVE NOW IS IN OUR CREST

02:56:11.961 --> 02:56:14.764
PROJECT WE'RE ADDING SEVERAL

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:16.032
HUNDRED BELTS AS PART OF THE-

02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:18.567
REVISION. THIS BIG PROJECT OUT

STUDENT HOUSING WEST I'M I

02:56:20.469 --> 02:56:21.604
THINK WE'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO

02:56:21.671 --> 02:56:23.306
GET TO BUILD IT AYE I DO WORRY

02:56:23.372 --> 02:56:24.507
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'LL BE

02:56:24.573 --> 02:56:26.442
ABLE TO AFFORD IT. ONCE IT

02:56:26.509 --> 02:56:27.777
FINALLY CLEARS THE LEGAL

02:56:27.843 --> 02:56:30.112
HURDLES IT HIGHLIGHTS FOR ME

02:56:30.179 --> 02:56:32.281
THE NEED FOR OUR USES ACTORS TO

02:56:32.348 --> 02:56:34.817
ALWAYS HAVE HOUSING PROJECTS IN

02:56:34.884 --> 02:56:37.486
DEVELOPMENT. IF WE ANTICIPATE

02:56:37.553 --> 02:56:39.288
THAT THAT TIMELINE IS THE

02:56:39.355 --> 02:56:41.757
LENGTH OF THE PIE I DELAYS DUE

02:56:41.824 --> 02:56:43.893
TO LITIGATION. IT MEANS THAT WE

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:45.728
SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE US SOME

02:56:45.795 --> 02:56:48.064
PROJECT IN DEVELOPMENT SO THAT

02:56:48.130 --> 02:56:50.066
THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

02:56:50.132 --> 02:56:52.168
DELIVER BAD IN A TIMELY WAY.

02:56:52.234 --> 02:56:54.637
WANT TO DIMINISH AT IN OUR TWO

02:56:54.704 --> 02:56:55.438
THOUSAND AND FIVE LONG RANGE

02:56:55.504 --> 02:56:57.273
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. WE DID

02:56:57.340 --> 02:56:59.342
RECEIVE A NUMBER OF LEGAL

02:56:59.408 --> 02:57:01.344
CHALLENGES TO THAT PLANT.

02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:03.746
INCLUDING FROM OUR COMMUNITY

02:57:03.813 --> 02:57:06.182
GOVERNMENT AND AS PART OF THE

02:57:06.248 --> 02:57:08.017
THAT COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT

02:57:08.084 --> 02:57:09.852
AGREEMENT THAT RISK. THAT

02:57:09.919 --> 02:57:11.988
LITIGATION THE CAMPUS HAD

02:57:12.054 --> 02:57:15.524
SIMILAR- DEMANDS A DEBT THAT WE

02:57:15.591 --> 02:57:18.427
MET. FOR A GROWING HOUSING AS

02:57:18.494 --> 02:57:20.997
WE GREW ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO THE

02:57:21.063 --> 02:57:23.499
ENROLLMENT OUT TARGET CAP FOR

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:24.934
THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

02:57:25.001 --> 02:57:26.402
WAS REDUCED AS PART OF THE

02:57:26.469 --> 02:57:28.771
APPLICATION. AND SO THAT'S ONE

02:57:28.838 --> 02:57:29.905
THING THAT WE'RE HOPING TO

02:57:29.972 --> 02:57:33.075
AVOID OUT THROUGH THIS HOUSING-

02:57:33.142 --> 02:57:35.511
COMMITMENT. TO HOUSE A 100% OF

02:57:35.578 --> 02:57:38.781
STUDENTS IS. A GROWING TO

02:57:38.848 --> 02:57:39.382
TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS

02:57:39.448 --> 02:57:42.618
WOULD BE MEAN ADDING. NINE

02:57:42.685 --> 02:57:43.219
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS

02:57:43.285 --> 02:57:45.588
MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND

02:57:45.654 --> 02:57:48.290
FIVE HUNDRED. AND TO OUR TWO

02:57:48.357 --> 02:57:48.858
THOUSAND AND FIVE LONG RANGE

02:57:48.924 --> 02:57:52.228
DEVELOPMENT PLAN. BECAUSE WE-

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:53.829
ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO ACCESS

02:57:53.896 --> 02:57:55.431
FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ON OUR

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:57.233
CAMPUS. THAT WOULD BE A

02:57:57.299 --> 02:57:59.402
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

02:57:59.468 --> 02:58:00.169
NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT WE'RE

02:58:00.236 --> 02:58:05.141
ABLE TO. ACCOMMODATE. ON OUR

02:58:05.207 --> 02:58:06.542
CAMPUSES RESIDENTIAL. THE OTHER

02:58:06.609 --> 02:58:08.878
HALF OF I JUST HAVE BE ON IS I

02:58:08.944 --> 02:58:11.547
CAN'T I DON'T I CAN REALLY GROW

02:58:11.614 --> 02:58:13.416
ENROLLMENT WITHOUT HOUSING.

02:58:13.482 --> 02:58:14.917
WHERE WOULD THOSE STUDENTS LIVE

02:58:14.984 --> 02:58:17.253
WE CAN'T BRING STUDENTS TO

02:58:17.319 --> 02:58:20.823
SANTA CRUZ. AND THEN AND THEN

02:58:20.890 --> 02:58:21.390
NOT HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM TO

02:58:21.457 --> 02:58:25.528

RETENTION AND SUCCESS IS

03:00:04.026 --> 03:00:05.794
DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO HOW MUCH

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:08.030
TIME STUDENTS SPEND ON CAMPUS.

03:00:08.097 --> 03:00:09.665

ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINTS IT'S

03:00:36.091 --> 03:00:37.760
ALSO IN THE PROGRAMMING. THE

03:00:37.826 --> 03:00:39.695
COMMUNITY BUILDING THAT HAS TO

03:00:39.762 --> 03:00:41.764
UNFOLD IN THE SPACE IN WHICH

03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:44.200
THE DORMS ARE LOCATED. THAT YOU

03:00:44.266 --> 03:00:46.368
REQUIRES RESOURCES AND LIKE THE

03:00:46.435 --> 03:00:48.404
BRICK AND MORTAR THE DATA TELLS

03:00:48.470 --> 03:00:50.372
US THAT IT IS MONEY EXTREMELY

03:00:50.439 --> 03:00:52.408
WELL SPENT BECAUSE THE RETURN

03:00:52.474 --> 03:00:54.009
IS ONCE AGAIN HIGHER

03:00:54.076 --> 03:00:55.678
PERSISTENCE AND GRADUATION

03:00:55.744 --> 03:00:57.680
RATES AND LOWER EQUITY GAPS AND

03:00:57.746 --> 03:01:00.349
THAT IS OUR GOAL- WITH ALL THIS

03:01:00.416 --> 03:01:02.818
IN MIND- A CENTRAL PART OF

03:01:02.885 --> 03:01:04.987
CASTING FORTUNES MASTER PLAN.

03:01:05.054 --> 03:01:07.389
IS TO BUILD WHAT I CALL A

03:01:07.456 --> 03:01:08.357
TWENTY FOUR HOUR CAMPUS

03:01:08.424 --> 03:01:09.858
COMMUNITY NO LONGER DO WE WANT

03:01:09.925 --> 03:01:10.926
TO BE KNOWN AS A COMPUTER

03:01:10.993 --> 03:01:12.962
COMMUTER CAMPUS BUT A CAMPUS

03:01:13.028 --> 03:01:15.097
COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO DO THAT

03:01:15.164 --> 03:01:16.398
THOUGH WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:16.465 --> 03:01:17.466
INVEST IN MORE AFFORDABLE

03:01:17.533 --> 03:01:18.934
HOUSING FOR STUDENTS AND THE

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:21.637
KEY WORD THERE IS AFFORDABLE

03:01:21.704 --> 03:01:23.105
LET'S BE CLEAR HERE ORANGE

03:01:23.172 --> 03:01:24.873
COUNTY IS NOT AND AFFORDABLE

03:01:24.940 --> 03:01:27.176
AREA TO LIVE FOR OUR STUDENTS

03:01:27.243 --> 03:01:29.812
WITH THE COST TO RENT A TYPICAL

03:01:29.878 --> 03:01:30.879
TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT BEING

03:01:30.946 --> 03:01:32.281

DOLLARS A MONTH NOT INCLUDING

03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:35.351
UTILITIES. I'M AYE OUR STUDENTS

03:01:35.417 --> 03:01:36.685

03:01:36.752 --> 03:01:39.788
RENTAL RATE MARKETS OF ANY

03:01:39.855 --> 03:01:41.624
SERVICE REGION IN THE SYSTEM.

03:01:41.690 --> 03:01:43.926
AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NUMBER

03:01:43.993 --> 03:01:44.426
THREE IN THE NATION FOR

03:01:44.493 --> 03:01:45.661
GRADUATING STUDENTS FROM POOR

03:01:45.728 --> 03:01:47.396
HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED

03:01:47.463 --> 03:01:49.064
COMMUNITIES AND WE HAVE MORE

03:01:49.131 --> 03:01:50.199
THAN A THOUSAND STUDENTS ON A

03:01:50.266 --> 03:01:51.700
WAITING LIST TO GET INTO OUR

03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:54.069

03:02:02.911 --> 03:02:04.146
TALKED ABOUT OVER AND OVER

03:02:04.213 --> 03:02:05.881
AGAIN. HE COST OF BUILDING AND

03:02:05.948 --> 03:02:07.049
OPERATING THEM HAS TO BE

03:02:07.116 --> 03:02:08.150
COVERED WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE

03:02:08.217 --> 03:02:09.618
GENERATED WE DON'T HAVE A

03:02:09.685 --> 03:02:11.153
SEPARATE ONGOING FUNDING

03:02:11.220 --> 03:02:13.589
SOURCE. TO SUBSIDIZE OUR

03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:15.024
HOUSING SO I CAL STATE

03:02:15.090 --> 03:02:17.293
FULLERTON WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWO

03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:19.428
HOUSING PROJECTS IN PROGRESS.

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:19.862
ONE OF THOSE HOUSING

03:02:19.928 --> 03:02:21.730
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IS OUR

03:02:21.797 --> 03:02:23.198
PHASE FOUR PROJECT WHICH IS

03:02:23.265 --> 03:02:24.333
AMENDMENT MCCARTY YES MA'AM

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:26.435
MCCARTY HAS SEEN. AND IS

03:02:26.502 --> 03:02:27.269
CURRENTLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION

03:02:27.336 --> 03:02:30.105
STAGE OF YOU DRIVE BY THE FIFTY

03:02:30.172 --> 03:02:30.773
SEVEN FREEWAY YOU SEE IT

03:02:30.839 --> 03:02:32.875
RISING. I'M IS MORE THAN HALF

03:02:32.941 --> 03:02:34.576
CONSTRUCTED IT'LL BE COMPLETED

03:02:34.643 --> 03:02:36.979
IN- AN ONLINE READY FOR

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:38.414
STUDENTS IN JUST ABOUT TEN

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:40.482
MONTHS IN AUGUST TWENTY TWO.

03:02:40.549 --> 03:02:44.820
AND IT'LL ADD SIX HUNDRED BEDS-

03:02:44.887 --> 03:02:46.322
TO OUR CAMPUS. THAT'S THE GOOD

03:02:46.388 --> 03:02:47.956
NEWS BUT ONCE THAT PROJECT IS

03:02:48.023 --> 03:02:49.725
COMPLETED THE CAMPUS WHAT WILL

03:02:49.792 --> 03:02:51.960
BEGIN TO PHASE FIVE PROJECT.

03:02:52.027 --> 03:02:54.496
WHICH WILL INCLUDE DEMOLISHING

03:02:54.563 --> 03:02:55.531
THREE OUTDATED HOUSING

03:02:55.597 --> 03:02:58.400
BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT IN

03:02:58.467 --> 03:02:58.934
NINETEEN EIGHTY AND WHICH

03:02:59.001 --> 03:03:00.169
CURRENTLY HOW STUDENTS THAT

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:03.105
HAVE- IN IN INTO THE FACILITIES

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:04.340
THAT HAVE EXCEEDED THEIR USEFUL

03:03:04.406 --> 03:03:06.975
LIFE AND- WILL SOON FRANKLY BE

03:03:07.042 --> 03:03:08.911
UNINHABITABLE DUE TO FIRE LIFE

03:03:08.977 --> 03:03:11.380
SAFETY CODES ADA ISSUES AND ALL

03:03:11.447 --> 03:03:13.615
FAILING UTILITY LINES. BY A BY

03:03:13.682 --> 03:03:14.883
THE WAY AS A SIDE NOTE THIS

03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:16.352
UNDERSCORES WHAT WAS TALKED

03:03:16.418 --> 03:03:17.720
ABOUT EARLIER THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:03:17.786 --> 03:03:19.822
HAVING THE FUNDS NOT ONLY TO

03:03:19.888 --> 03:03:21.323
CONSTRUCT NEW HOUSING BUT A

03:03:21.390 --> 03:03:22.391
DRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:03:22.458 --> 03:03:25.060
BEFORE IT BECOMES SORT OF BIRD.

03:03:25.127 --> 03:03:26.095
WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW THAT

03:03:26.161 --> 03:03:27.663
IT'S CHEAPER TO KNOCK THE

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:29.798
BUILDING DOWN AND START OVER-

03:03:29.865 --> 03:03:31.033
THE ELIMINATION OF THESE

03:03:31.100 --> 03:03:33.969
BUILDINGS WELL A RACE ABOUT

03:03:34.036 --> 03:03:34.570
THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BEDS

03:03:34.636 --> 03:03:36.372
LEADING US. AFTER THE FIRST

03:03:36.438 --> 03:03:38.741
PROJECT DONE WITH ONLY TO LEARN

03:03:38.807 --> 03:03:41.910
FIVE BEDS UNTIL WE COMPLETE

03:03:41.977 --> 03:03:43.145
PHASE FIVE. AS I SAID BECAUSE

03:03:43.212 --> 03:03:44.913
HOUSING IS SELF SUPPORTING THAT

03:03:44.980 --> 03:03:46.248
THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO

03:03:46.315 --> 03:03:47.149
PAY FOR THEMSELVES IT'S

03:03:47.216 --> 03:03:48.617
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT

03:03:48.684 --> 03:03:50.619
ANYTIME A CAMPUS HAS TO

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:52.321
ELIMINATE BANDS SUCH AS THE

03:03:52.388 --> 03:03:53.856
ACTION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:03:53.922 --> 03:03:56.625
HERE. THAT IMPACTS REVENUE FOR

03:03:56.692 --> 03:03:57.659
HOUSING FOR OUR SELF SUPPORT

03:03:57.726 --> 03:03:59.261
AND THAT'S RATHER DO THAT.

03:03:59.328 --> 03:04:00.462
ULTIMATELY GOES DIRECTLY

03:04:00.529 --> 03:04:01.797
TOWARDS SUPPORTING FUTURE

03:04:01.864 --> 03:04:04.032
HOUSING PROJECTS. SO WITHOUT

03:04:04.099 --> 03:04:05.667
ANY HELP TO OFFSET THIS LOSS OF

03:04:05.734 --> 03:04:07.703
REVENUE WE HAVE LESS RESOURCES

03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:09.104
TO PUT TOWARD SUPPORTING FUTURE

03:04:09.171 --> 03:04:11.240
HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT'S WHY

HAVING THIS HEARING ABOUT HERE

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:17.446

03:04:17.513 --> 03:04:18.647
HOUSING NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS

03:04:18.714 --> 03:04:20.082

FUTURE DEBT SERVICE WILL BE

03:04:23.685 --> 03:04:25.020
SIGNIFICANT AND IT WILL MAKE IT

03:04:25.087 --> 03:04:26.388
VERY DIFFICULT TO PURSUE OUR

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:28.590

COST OF THESE BEDS THAT WILL

03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:07.129

SCOPE OF EACH RESPECTIVE CAMPUS

03:05:58.380 --> 03:05:59.781
THIS WAS TOUCHED ON AS WELL FOR

03:05:59.848 --> 03:06:02.117
EXAMPLE FOR A SMALL CAMPUS WITH

03:06:02.184 --> 03:06:03.218
THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS

OTHER IF THEY ARE FOR PROP THE

03:08:03.839 --> 03:08:05.374
MANY TIMES IN THEIR- OWN BY

THESE. MAJOR REITS WHO ARE

03:08:07.009 --> 03:08:08.877
FOCUSED ON OUR Y. AND TAKING

03:08:08.944 --> 03:08:10.679

03:08:13.015 --> 03:08:14.282
STUDENT HOUSING IN SOMEBODY'S

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:16.318
AREAS. THAT THE CHARTS ARE

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:18.286
AFFORDABILITY. SOME OF THEIR

03:08:18.353 --> 03:08:19.921
SON THEY'RE MORE EXPENSIVE MOST

03:08:19.988 --> 03:08:21.523
LIKELY MORE EXPENSIVE ON CAMPUS

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:22.424
BUT ACTUALLY IN SOME OF THE

03:08:22.491 --> 03:08:23.925
CAMPUS IT SAYS HERE. THAT ARE A

03:08:23.992 --> 03:08:27.129
LITTLE BIT LESS EXPENSIVE. SO

03:08:27.195 --> 03:08:29.464

03:08:36.204 --> 03:08:37.205
RIGHT AROUND HERE IT'S- YEAH

03:08:37.272 --> 03:08:38.040

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:41.643
GENERAL COUNSEL FOR CSU. DO YOU

03:08:41.710 --> 03:08:43.245

WE SEE AROUND CSU CAMPUS THREAT

03:08:45.947 --> 03:08:46.381
CALIFORNIA FULLERTON AND

03:08:46.448 --> 03:08:50.285
ELSEWHERE. I THINK YEAH-

03:08:50.352 --> 03:08:51.853
INSULIN MCCARTY WE TALKED ABOUT

03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:53.221
THIS A LITTLE BIT WHEN YOU WERE

03:08:53.288 --> 03:08:55.123
HERE ON CAMPUS. THERE'S A

03:08:55.190 --> 03:08:57.959
REASON WHY- THEY WERE

03:08:58.026 --> 03:09:00.395
DEVELOPERS THAT ARE PRODUCING

03:09:00.462 --> 03:09:01.763
HOUSING DEPARTMENT HOUSING

03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:05.200
DEVELOPMENTS OFF- OFF OF THE-

03:09:05.267 --> 03:09:06.868
CAMPUS. AND THAT IS BECAUSE

03:09:06.935 --> 03:09:08.437
THEY THEY SEE THE DEMAND. FOR

03:09:08.503 --> 03:09:10.005
THAT HOUSING AND THEY BELIEVE

03:09:10.072 --> 03:09:12.808
THAT THEY CAN- MAKE IT A YOU

03:09:12.874 --> 03:09:13.375
KNOW AS YOU SAID THESE ARE

03:09:13.442 --> 03:09:15.010
PROFITABLE AND ENTERPRISES THIS

03:09:15.077 --> 03:09:16.712
IS NOT A NON PROFIT SO THEY

03:09:16.778 --> 03:09:18.447
BELIEVE THAT IT IS. NOT

03:09:18.513 --> 03:09:19.581
FINANCIALLY VIABLE FOR THEM TO

03:09:19.648 --> 03:09:23.051
DO THIS- THERE THERE ARE- OFF

03:09:23.118 --> 03:09:25.654
CAMPUS AND PRIVATE DORMITORIES

03:09:25.721 --> 03:09:27.456
AROUND CAL STATE FULLERTON AND

03:09:27.522 --> 03:09:28.990
ACTUALLY THE CITY OF FULLERTON

03:09:29.057 --> 03:09:30.425
IS IN THE PROCESS UP. RIGHT NOW

03:09:30.492 --> 03:09:32.327
WELL CONSIDERING- I NEW

03:09:32.394 --> 03:09:35.397
PROJECT- RIGHT OFF OFF OF

03:09:35.464 --> 03:09:37.165
CAMPUS. THERE'S A BIG

03:09:37.232 --> 03:09:40.202
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE- THE-

03:09:40.268 --> 03:09:41.169
AT AND THEY SERVE THEIR

03:09:41.236 --> 03:09:43.705
PURPOSE- THERE IS WE HAVE. A

03:09:43.772 --> 03:09:44.973
NEED FOR HOUSING IF WE DIDN'T

03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:46.541
HAVE THOSE OFF CAMPUS PRIVATE

03:09:46.608 --> 03:09:49.144
HOUSING FOR PROFIT HOUSING-

03:09:49.211 --> 03:09:51.213
FACILITIES WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE

03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:54.349
TO. HOUSE STUDENTS. BUT THEY

03:09:54.416 --> 03:09:55.517
ARE TRADITIONALLY AND I'M I'M

03:09:55.584 --> 03:09:56.785
MOST OF THE TIME MORE

03:09:56.852 --> 03:09:58.787
EXPENSIVE. AND IN FACT THERE

03:09:58.854 --> 03:10:00.455
ARE ONE OF OCT PARATROOPERS AND

03:10:00.522 --> 03:10:01.356
THERE'S A PROGRAMMING

03:10:01.423 --> 03:10:06.561
DIFFERENCE REMEMBER I SPOKE.

03:10:06.628 --> 03:10:08.830
ABOUT THE- THE S. PERSISTED OF

03:10:08.897 --> 03:10:11.099
STEW ON CAMPUS SIX AS ARE. IN

03:10:11.166 --> 03:10:13.101
GRAD RATES AND LOWERING EQUITY

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:14.369
GAPS. THERE'S A LOT OF

03:10:14.436 --> 03:10:16.972
PROGRAMMING THAT GOES ON IN

03:10:17.038 --> 03:10:19.307
RESIDENTIAL LIFE ON CAMPUS AND

03:10:19.374 --> 03:10:22.144
THAT DOES NOT GO ON. ANY

03:10:22.210 --> 03:10:23.311
ANYWHERE THE TO THE SAME DEGREE

03:10:23.378 --> 03:10:25.881
THE SAME QUALITY OFF CAMPUS.

03:10:25.947 --> 03:10:28.316
AND SO WE ARE WE ARE FOCUSED ON

03:10:28.383 --> 03:10:31.586
PROVIDING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:10:31.653 --> 03:10:33.522
ON OUR CAMPUS BUT WITH GREAT-

03:10:33.588 --> 03:10:35.123
PROGRAMMING THAT GOES WITH IT

03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:36.892
THAT YIELDS THE DEMANDS THAT WE

03:10:36.958 --> 03:10:38.527
NEED TO SEE AN ORDER TO-

03:10:38.593 --> 03:10:40.829
JUSTIFY THAT HOUSE. YEAH AND

03:10:40.896 --> 03:10:42.731
THEN I KNOW YOU UC'S ARE

03:10:42.798 --> 03:10:44.766
DIFFERENT AND THEN SEE ISSUES

03:10:44.833 --> 03:10:45.867
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL

03:10:45.934 --> 03:10:48.670
CAN'T HOUSING AT THE UC SYSTEM.

03:10:48.737 --> 03:10:50.038
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT THEY'RE

03:10:50.105 --> 03:10:51.273
PROVIDING ENOUGH HOUSING FOR

03:10:51.339 --> 03:10:52.874
ABOUT HALF OF THEIR OVERALL

03:10:52.941 --> 03:10:56.611
UNDERGRADUATE SAID. AND IN CSU-

03:10:56.678 --> 03:10:58.613
I THINK WAS LIKE YOU KNOW A

03:10:58.680 --> 03:11:00.015
QUARTER AND THEN COMMITTEE

03:11:00.081 --> 03:11:01.817
CALLS ARE LIKE 1% IT YOU KNOW

03:11:01.883 --> 03:11:03.018
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT SINCE

03:11:03.084 --> 03:11:04.386
SEGMENTS. BUT WHICH WHEN WE

03:11:04.452 --> 03:11:06.188
SPOKE TO THE PRESIDENT'S THEIR

03:11:06.254 --> 03:11:07.355
LEADERSHIP AT SAC STATE THEY'RE

03:11:07.422 --> 03:11:09.157
SAYING ROUGHLY AT THIS CAMPUS

03:11:09.224 --> 03:11:11.293
HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND AGAIN

03:11:11.359 --> 03:11:13.061
IT'S NOT APPLES TO APPLES THEY

03:11:13.128 --> 03:11:13.662
WERE SAYING THAT THERE IS A

03:11:13.728 --> 03:11:15.864
FORMULA THAT THAT THE EXPERTS

03:11:15.931 --> 03:11:16.731
SAID THAT YOU NEEDED TO HAVE

03:11:16.798 --> 03:11:19.334

YOUR STUDENTS EITHER ON CAMPUS.

03:11:21.436 --> 03:11:23.738
OR ADJACENT TO CAMPUS. AND SO

AT SAC STATE THERE'S TWO

03:11:26.508 --> 03:11:29.778
THOUSAND- THERE'S ROUGHLY TWO

03:11:29.845 --> 03:11:31.079
THOUSAND ON CAMPUS HOUSING

03:11:31.146 --> 03:11:32.948
UNITS IN LIKE I SAT AROUND

03:11:33.014 --> 03:11:34.950
CAMPUS WITHIN A MILE THERE'S

03:11:35.016 --> 03:11:36.484
ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND BETS AND

03:11:36.551 --> 03:11:38.053
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVE BEEN

03:11:38.119 --> 03:11:39.387
BUILT THE LAST TEN YEARS I

03:11:39.454 --> 03:11:42.190
THINK. ALL OF THEM LAST- TEN

03:11:42.257 --> 03:11:45.594
YEARS ME 90% LEASED. SO THAT'S

03:11:45.660 --> 03:11:46.962
SET UP THE PHONE ON THERE AND

03:11:47.028 --> 03:11:48.363

03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:52.133
FULLER TEN. YOU HAVE ROUGHLY

03:11:52.200 --> 03:11:53.869
TWO THOUSAND ON CAMPUS- THE

03:11:53.935 --> 03:11:56.438
DADS AND YOUR FORTY THOUSAND

03:11:56.504 --> 03:11:58.673
CAMPUS SO DO YOU HAVE IT SOUNDS

03:11:58.740 --> 03:12:02.244
LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT. OF

03:12:02.310 --> 03:12:08.049
FOR PROFIT HOUSING. AROUND ARE

03:12:08.116 --> 03:12:08.683
NOWHERE NEAR THAT NUMBER TO GET

03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:09.951
TO THE A- THE FORM. THAT A

03:12:10.018 --> 03:12:11.419
THIRD AT YOU KNOW HOW FOR A

03:12:11.486 --> 03:12:13.121
YEARS TO. WITH AND LISTEN THEY

03:12:13.188 --> 03:12:16.625
CAN AREA. I'M NOT I WILL AS

03:12:16.691 --> 03:12:18.693
ACTUALLY BUT- I WOULD ANSWER

03:12:18.760 --> 03:12:19.728
YOUR QUESTION WAY I'M I HAD

03:12:19.794 --> 03:12:21.830
CURIOSITY WITH TO THIS AS WELL

03:12:21.897 --> 03:12:24.099
BECAUSE CSU'S HAVE IN A REMOTE

03:12:24.165 --> 03:12:25.500
OF THE C. ISSUES HEADQUARTERS

03:12:25.567 --> 03:12:26.902
BEEN KNOWN AS COMMUTER CAMPUSES

03:12:26.968 --> 03:12:28.336
WHERE STUDENTS COME AND GO TO

03:12:28.403 --> 03:12:30.305
SCHOOL AND LEAVE AND THERE'S

03:12:30.372 --> 03:12:32.841
BEEN A TRANSFORMATION OF MOST

03:12:32.908 --> 03:12:34.576
OF OUR CAMPUSES TO BE MUCH MORE

03:12:34.643 --> 03:12:36.711
COMMUNITY DRIVEN CAMPUSES WHERE

03:12:36.778 --> 03:12:40.181
STUDENTS- EXPERIENCE THE%

03:12:40.248 --> 03:12:41.950
UNIVERSITY CO CURRICULAR EARLY

03:12:42.017 --> 03:12:43.251
AS WELL AS IN THE CLASSROOM

03:12:43.318 --> 03:12:44.686
BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THE

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:47.088
BENEFITS OF THAT. SO I ASKED ON

03:12:47.155 --> 03:12:48.690
THE TO DO TO DO A STUDY OF

03:12:48.757 --> 03:12:50.458
WHERE OUR STUDENTS LIVE THAT

03:12:50.525 --> 03:12:52.994
COMES MORE CAMPUS 50% OF OUR

03:12:53.061 --> 03:12:54.863
STUDENTS WE HAVE FORTY ONE AND

03:12:54.930 --> 03:12:56.598
A HALF THOUSAND STUDENTS 50% OF

03:12:56.665 --> 03:12:58.867
OUR STUDENTS LIVE EITHER IN OUR

03:12:58.934 --> 03:13:00.535
ZIP CODE WE ARE PRETTY MUCH OUR

03:13:00.602 --> 03:13:02.304
OWN ZIP CODE OR IN ONE

03:13:02.370 --> 03:13:03.571
EDUCATION ZIP CODE RIGHT NEXT

03:13:03.638 --> 03:13:06.775
TO US. SO WE HAVE ONLY TWO

03:13:06.841 --> 03:13:08.209
THOUSAND BEDS ON CAMPUS THERE'S

03:13:08.276 --> 03:13:10.712
PROBABLY ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR

03:13:10.779 --> 03:13:13.181
THOUSAND BEDS- ADJACENT TO THE

03:13:13.248 --> 03:13:15.750
CAMPUS AND THEN STUDENTS LIVE

03:13:15.817 --> 03:13:16.451
IN WHICH IS WHY WE NEED

03:13:16.518 --> 03:13:18.186
STUDENTS HOW SOON HOUSING THEY

03:13:18.253 --> 03:13:20.522
SHOT THEMSELVES INTO APARTMENTS

03:13:20.588 --> 03:13:23.091
AND- HOUSES AND ANYTHING THEY

03:13:23.158 --> 03:13:26.227
CAN GET. WITH TOO MANY PEOPLE

03:13:26.294 --> 03:13:27.996
IN NOT GOOD CONDITIONS AND

03:13:28.063 --> 03:13:29.230
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR STUDENTS

03:13:29.297 --> 03:13:30.432
FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

03:13:30.498 --> 03:13:32.701
WHO CAN ONLY AFFORD TO THAT-

03:13:32.767 --> 03:13:34.269
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

03:13:34.336 --> 03:13:35.603
ACHIEVE BY CORRECT CREATING

03:13:35.670 --> 03:13:38.039
MORE HOUSING ON CAMPUS THE

03:13:38.106 --> 03:13:39.908
DOUBLE EFFECT OF PRODUCING

03:13:39.975 --> 03:13:41.242
QUALITY HOUSING FOR THEM THAT

03:13:41.309 --> 03:13:43.178
THEY DESERVE AND NEED AND THE

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:44.746
PROGRAMMING AROUND IT SO THAT

03:13:44.813 --> 03:13:46.481
THEY WILL PERSIST AND TO

03:13:46.548 --> 03:13:48.316
GRADUATION I THINK THAT ANSWER

03:13:48.383 --> 03:13:50.919
YOUR QUESTION. YEAH IT SO IT IS

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:52.654
THAT A OUGH FORMULA THOUGH THE

03:13:52.721 --> 03:13:55.023
30% IT IS NOT A GOAL FOR

03:13:55.090 --> 03:13:56.324
EXAMPLE FULLER TENDED DO YOU

03:13:56.391 --> 03:13:57.892
WANT TO HAVE A GOAL THAT YOU

03:13:57.959 --> 03:14:00.862
HAVE ENOUGH. ON CAMPUS HOUSING

03:14:00.929 --> 03:14:02.764
OR RELATIVELY CLOSE THE WHAT

03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:04.332
LET'S SAY WALKABLE HOUSE YOU

03:14:04.399 --> 03:14:06.568
COULD WALK TO CAMPUS FROM THE

03:14:06.634 --> 03:14:08.670
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FOR A THIRD

03:14:08.737 --> 03:14:09.437
OF YOUR STUDENTS OR IS THAT

03:14:09.504 --> 03:14:15.510
JUST SOMETHING THAT SACRAMENTO.

03:14:15.577 --> 03:14:16.144
WAS DOING ON THE ROAD. I THINK

03:14:16.211 --> 03:14:17.812
IT'S A GOOD ROUGH- THUMBNAIL

03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:18.880
BUT I BUT IT ALSO IS TO DEPEND

03:14:18.947 --> 03:14:21.016
ON THE- AND SOME TALKED. I I

03:14:21.082 --> 03:14:25.720
THINK IT WAS- UC SAN DIEGO OR-

03:14:25.787 --> 03:14:27.589
THAT AVAILABILITY OF LAND CAL

03:14:27.655 --> 03:14:28.623
STATE FULLERTON DOESN'T HAVE

03:14:28.690 --> 03:14:31.426
THE LAN- AND NOT ONLY DO WE NOT

03:14:31.493 --> 03:14:33.728
HAVE THE LAND- THE- WE ARE

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:35.096
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY

03:14:35.163 --> 03:14:37.332
DENSE URBAN AREA. SO IT WOULD

03:14:37.399 --> 03:14:39.467
BE GREAT TO HAVE A FIFTY

03:14:39.534 --> 03:14:41.302
PERCENT- IT RATHER THAN A THIRD

03:14:41.369 --> 03:14:42.904
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT DOABLE

03:14:42.971 --> 03:14:44.773
OUR GOAL IS TO GET TO FIVE

03:14:44.839 --> 03:14:46.474
THOUSAND BEDS ON CAMPUS. WHICH

03:14:46.541 --> 03:14:48.843
WILL CREATE A CRITICAL MASS ON

03:14:48.910 --> 03:14:50.779
CAMPUS ALLOW US TO INCREASE

03:14:50.845 --> 03:14:52.080
SUBSTANTIALLY THE NUMBER OF

03:14:52.147 --> 03:14:53.882
FIRST TIME FRESHMEN. OR FIRST

03:14:53.948 --> 03:14:55.150
TIME COMMITTEE COLLEGE TRANSFER

03:14:55.216 --> 03:14:56.317
STUDENTS THAT COME TO CAMPUS

03:14:56.384 --> 03:14:58.119
THAT ARE ON CAMPUS BECAUSE THAT

03:14:58.186 --> 03:14:59.187
IS WHERE WE THINK WE CAN HAVE

03:14:59.254 --> 03:15:01.156
THE GREATEST IMPACT. AND THEN

03:15:01.222 --> 03:15:02.791
WELL WE ARE WE WOULD BE MORE

03:15:02.857 --> 03:15:04.492
THAN HAPPY TO SEE A MORE

03:15:04.559 --> 03:15:06.494
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT OFF CAMPUS-

03:15:06.561 --> 03:15:08.630
BUT WE WILL. YOU KNOW WHAT WE

03:15:08.696 --> 03:15:12.100
CAN CONTROL. IS WHAT'S GOING ON

03:15:12.167 --> 03:15:13.635
ON CAMPUS. THANK YOU I

03:15:13.701 --> 03:15:17.505
QUESTIONS MISTING MISTER TANK.

03:15:17.572 --> 03:15:22.077
IF YOU HAD YOUR YOUR- IF YOU

03:15:22.143 --> 03:15:23.645
HAVE THE FUNDS HOW MUCH CAN

03:15:23.711 --> 03:15:24.646
CAMPUS HOW MUCH HOUSING CAMPUS

03:15:24.712 --> 03:15:28.049
WOULD YOU WANT TO BUILD. I'M

03:15:28.116 --> 03:15:28.650

CAMPUS HOUSING WOULD YOU WANT

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:32.921
TO BUILD THIS IS A GOOD WOULD

03:15:32.987 --> 03:15:34.789
BE FIVE THOUSAND WOULD BE MORE.

03:15:34.856 --> 03:15:36.925
WELL OUR MASTER PLAN WHICH WE

03:15:36.991 --> 03:15:38.126
JUST GOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD

03:15:38.193 --> 03:15:39.461
OF TRUSTEES CALLS FOR FIVE

03:15:39.527 --> 03:15:41.429
THOUSAND. I MEAN THAT IS. WHEN

03:15:41.496 --> 03:15:42.864
WE ONLY HAD TWO THOUSAND BEDS

03:15:42.931 --> 03:15:44.699
ON CAMPUS THAT IS THE-

03:15:44.766 --> 03:15:46.601
ASPIRATIONAL GOAL. I THINK WHAT

03:15:46.668 --> 03:15:48.436
WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS GET TO

03:15:48.503 --> 03:15:48.970
FIVE THOUSAND CREATE THAT

03:15:49.037 --> 03:15:51.506
COMMUNITY- THAT SORT TWENTY

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:54.209
FOUR HOUR ON CAMPUS- A LIFE

03:15:54.275 --> 03:15:55.310
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND

03:15:55.376 --> 03:15:58.813
THEN- A SCALE UP FROM THERE. AS

03:15:58.880 --> 03:16:01.049
AS WE GROW AS A CAMPUS. ARE

03:16:01.116 --> 03:16:03.418
YOU. AS BEING THE LARGEST CSU.

03:16:03.485 --> 03:16:05.553
I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A-

03:16:05.620 --> 03:16:08.289
A CHANGE AS WE COME BACK FROM-

03:16:08.356 --> 03:16:11.426
VIRTUAL LEARNING- TO A- BOTH A

03:16:11.493 --> 03:16:13.428
HYBRID KIND OF. RELATIONSHIP

03:16:13.495 --> 03:16:14.429
WHERE WE HAVE STUDENTS ON

03:16:14.496 --> 03:16:15.463
CAMPUS AT DIFFERENT TIMES

03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:18.733
DURING THE DAY. SO I THINK FIVE

03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:19.467
THOUSANDS WHERE WE'RE HEADED

03:16:19.534 --> 03:16:21.803
RIGHT NOW. GREAT HE YOU'D

03:16:21.870 --> 03:16:23.238
MENTIONED YOU'RE HAVING TO TEAR

03:16:23.304 --> 03:16:24.939
DOWN BUILDINGS THAT WERE BUILT

03:16:25.006 --> 03:16:26.841
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. CAN YOU

03:16:26.908 --> 03:16:28.977
GIVE US A- UNDERSTANDING OF

03:16:29.043 --> 03:16:31.412
WHY. THEDEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:16:31.479 --> 03:16:32.881
WASN'T TAKEN CARE OF OUT OF

03:16:32.947 --> 03:16:35.416
RESERVES. BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY

03:16:35.483 --> 03:16:36.684
IF YOU. IF YOU'RE BRINGING IN

03:16:36.751 --> 03:16:38.253
INCOME YOU'D SET ASIDE PART OF

03:16:38.319 --> 03:16:42.991
THEIR INCOME. FOR RESERVE SO.

03:16:43.057 --> 03:16:43.591
YOU COULD DO YOUR MAINTENANCE

03:16:43.658 --> 03:16:44.859
ANNUAL. SELL I WILL A QUESTION

03:16:44.926 --> 03:16:46.628
A COUPLE OF WAYS FIRST OF ALL

03:16:46.694 --> 03:16:48.263
WE DO SET ASIDE SIGNIFICANT

03:16:48.329 --> 03:16:51.666
AMOUNT FOR MAINTENANCE OF OUR

03:16:51.733 --> 03:16:53.768
FACILITIES AND- WE HAVE A LOT-

03:16:53.835 --> 03:16:55.537
THAT'S THOSE ARE THE BUILDING

03:16:55.603 --> 03:16:56.337
TO BE HAVE TO TEAR DOWN IS

03:16:56.404 --> 03:16:57.805
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED

03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.374
BEDS- AND WE HAVE. AS I SAID

03:16:59.440 --> 03:17:01.109
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AS THE REST

03:17:01.176 --> 03:17:02.844
OF THEM ARE MUCH NEWER AND-

03:17:02.911 --> 03:17:05.680
HAVE BEEN KEPT UP QUITE WELL-

03:17:05.747 --> 03:17:07.815
THE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:17:07.882 --> 03:17:08.917
WITH THIS BUILDING THAT WOULD

03:17:08.983 --> 03:17:10.151
BE THAT THAT'S THAT WERE BUILT

03:17:10.218 --> 03:17:11.753
IN THE NIGHT. IN EARLY NINETEEN

03:17:11.819 --> 03:17:12.921
EIGHTIES IT'S LIKE NINETEEN

03:17:12.987 --> 03:17:15.123
EIGHTIES EIGHTY FIVE OR EIGHTY

03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:16.324
FOUR I'M IS THE USEFUL LIFE OF

03:17:16.391 --> 03:17:17.392
THOSE BUILDINGS HAS JUST THEY

03:17:17.458 --> 03:17:18.560
JUST WORN OUT. THERE

03:17:18.626 --> 03:17:22.063
SEISMICALLY UNSAFE THE BONES OF

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:25.266
THE BUILDINGS THE HVAC AND THE-

03:17:25.333 --> 03:17:27.635
AND THE PLUMBING AND THEIR

03:17:27.702 --> 03:17:30.138
MULTI STORY- HAS ROTTED AND

03:17:30.205 --> 03:17:31.673
DECAYED TO THE POINT WHERE THE

03:17:31.739 --> 03:17:33.007
USEFUL LIFE OF THE BUILDINGS IS

03:17:33.074 --> 03:17:34.375
OVER AND NO AMOUNT OF DEFERRED

03:17:34.442 --> 03:17:36.844
MAINTENANCE- WOULD HAVE. TAKING

03:17:36.911 --> 03:17:38.079
CARE OF THAT ISSUE THEY THEY'VE

03:17:38.146 --> 03:17:39.781
JUST. THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE

03:17:39.847 --> 03:17:41.316
BUILDINGS AS OVER AND THEIR

03:17:41.382 --> 03:17:42.951
SEISMICALLY UNSAFE SO WE NEED

03:17:43.017 --> 03:17:46.120
TO TAKE THEM DOWN- BUT- WE

03:17:46.187 --> 03:17:48.056
DEFINITELY PAY GREAT ATTENTION

03:17:48.122 --> 03:17:49.824
TO THE ISSUE- EXTENDING THE

03:17:49.891 --> 03:17:52.227
LIFE OF OUR- ALL OUR BUILDINGS

03:17:52.293 --> 03:17:53.661
ARMENIA MOST OF THE BUILDINGS

03:17:53.728 --> 03:17:54.996
ON THE CAMPUS THE ACADEMIC

03:17:55.063 --> 03:17:56.297
BUILDINGS THEY HAVE. BUILT IN

03:17:56.364 --> 03:17:57.799
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES NINETEEN

03:17:57.865 --> 03:17:59.167
SIXTIES NINETEEN SEVENTIES SO

03:17:59.234 --> 03:18:00.435
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS

03:18:00.501 --> 03:18:04.872
CONSTANTLY AN ISSUE. THAT WE'RE

03:18:04.939 --> 03:18:05.506
PAYING GOOD ATTENTION TO. RIGHT

03:18:05.573 --> 03:18:07.809
THE- BUT THE APARTMENT BUILDING

03:18:07.875 --> 03:18:08.943
OF THIRTY FIVE YEARS THAT IS

03:18:09.010 --> 03:18:11.646
NOT A USEFUL LIFE SO WAS IT

03:18:11.713 --> 03:18:14.449
BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL PROJECT

03:18:14.515 --> 03:18:17.619
WAS JUST POORLY CONSTRUCTED WAS.

03:18:17.685 --> 03:18:20.321
NOT MAINTAINED OVER ITS THIRTY

03:18:20.388 --> 03:18:21.489
FIVE YEARS TO MEAN THE BUILDING

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:23.524
SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN

03:18:23.591 --> 03:18:24.058
THIRTY FIVE YEARS IF IT'S

03:18:24.125 --> 03:18:26.094
PROPERLY BUILT AND- PROPERLY

03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.463
MAINTAINED. YEAH I THINK IT'S A

03:18:28.529 --> 03:18:31.332
COMBINATION OF THINGS- YOU KNOW

03:18:31.399 --> 03:18:32.767
YOU CAN THAT BUILDING CODES

03:18:32.834 --> 03:18:33.901
WERE VERY DIFFERENT BACK THEN

03:18:33.968 --> 03:18:38.373
FOR- SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS AND-

03:18:38.439 --> 03:18:40.475
THE- YOU KNOW I WAS NOT THERE

03:18:40.541 --> 03:18:42.010
WHEN THAT BUILDING WAS BUILT SO

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:44.112
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE- SPECS

03:18:44.178 --> 03:18:45.613
WERE BUT I IMAGINE. THEY WOULD

03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:46.914
BE COMPLETE COMPLETELY

03:18:46.981 --> 03:18:48.616
DIFFERENT TODAY BUT AS WE'VE

03:18:48.683 --> 03:18:51.953
GONE AS WE'VE GONE IN TO. DO

03:18:52.020 --> 03:18:54.222
THE REPAIRS FOR THAT THE THAT

03:18:54.289 --> 03:18:55.423
BUILDING AND WE COULD WE'D WE'D

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:57.492
LOOK AT DOING THE REPAIRS

03:18:57.558 --> 03:18:59.193
COMPLETELY REPLACING ALL OF THE

03:18:59.260 --> 03:19:01.262
PLUMBING AND HVAC AND

03:19:01.329 --> 03:19:03.164
RETROFITTING IT FOR SEISMIC THE

03:19:03.231 --> 03:19:05.400
COST OF DOING THAT EXCEEDS THE

03:19:05.466 --> 03:19:06.301
COST OF TEARING IT DOWN TO

03:19:06.367 --> 03:19:07.702
BUILDING A NEW BUILDING. THAT'S

03:19:07.769 --> 03:19:09.737
THE REAL ROUTE THERE WE COULD

03:19:09.804 --> 03:19:11.606
FIX THE BUILDING. AND WE COULD

03:19:11.673 --> 03:19:13.508
HAVE THESE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

03:19:13.574 --> 03:19:14.809
BEDS IN THE OLD BUILDING THAT

03:19:14.876 --> 03:19:16.678
IS SAFE AND WE CAN MODERNIZE

03:19:16.744 --> 03:19:18.046
THE BUILDING BUT IT WOULD COST

03:19:18.112 --> 03:19:19.380
MORE TO DO THAT THAN TO TEAR

03:19:19.447 --> 03:19:20.982
DOWN AND BUILD A NEW BUILDING

03:19:21.049 --> 03:19:23.785
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BILL. NOW

03:19:23.851 --> 03:19:24.385
UNDERSTAND I JUST I JUST WANNA

03:19:24.452 --> 03:19:26.220
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- LEARNING

03:19:26.287 --> 03:19:28.256
THOSE TYPES OF LESSONS I

03:19:28.323 --> 03:19:30.024
REPRESENT A CITY. WE HAVE

03:19:30.091 --> 03:19:31.793
PLENTY OF BUILDINGS IN OUR CITY

03:19:31.859 --> 03:19:33.661
THERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OR-

03:19:33.728 --> 03:19:37.765
SO AGAIN- HERE WE'RE WE'RE

03:19:37.832 --> 03:19:39.567
GIVING OUT THIS GRANT MONEY.

03:19:39.634 --> 03:19:41.936
WHAT I WOULD HOPE. I SAID IT

03:19:42.003 --> 03:19:43.938
SOUNDS LIKE BOTH WHAT HAPPENED

03:19:44.005 --> 03:19:45.840
WAS POOR CONSTRUCTION AND POOR

03:19:45.907 --> 03:19:47.608
MINUTES SOUNDS SOUNDS LIKE.

03:19:47.675 --> 03:19:53.014
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. HAPPENED-

03:19:53.081 --> 03:19:54.716
SO. IF YOU DON'T THE BLACK OF

03:19:54.782 --> 03:19:56.150
PREVIOUS BEEN A- BUT THERE'S NO

03:19:56.217 --> 03:19:57.085
THAT A- SHOULD NOT LST MORE

03:19:57.151 --> 03:19:59.387
THAN. THIRTY FIVE YEARS I DON'T

03:19:59.454 --> 03:20:01.322
CARE- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT

03:20:01.389 --> 03:20:02.724
TALKING ABOUT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY

03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:04.092
BUILDING GO TO TALK ABOUT

03:20:04.158 --> 03:20:04.692
NINETEEN EIGHTY BUILDING CODE

03:20:04.759 --> 03:20:06.427
SO. I HAVE TO BUILDING HAS

03:20:06.494 --> 03:20:09.063
BUILDING PROTECT EVOLVED.

03:20:09.130 --> 03:20:10.732
THEY'RE PLENTY OF BUILDINGS IN

03:20:10.798 --> 03:20:11.532
THERE PLENTY OF APARTMENT

03:20:11.599 --> 03:20:14.135
BUILDINGS BUILT IN NINETEEN

03:20:14.202 --> 03:20:15.903
EIGHTY FIVE THAT. ARE FINE.

03:20:15.970 --> 03:20:18.339
TOTALLY FINE. I AND MANY

03:20:18.406 --> 03:20:19.974
MEANINGFUL TO SO SOUNDS LIKE

03:20:20.041 --> 03:20:21.809
AND IT WAS. YOU KNOW SOME

03:20:21.876 --> 03:20:23.177
PEOPLE FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL

03:20:23.244 --> 03:20:24.746
AND DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS.

03:20:24.812 --> 03:20:27.882
THE LAST THING WE WANT IS MONEY

03:20:27.949 --> 03:20:28.983
IN THE GRANT PROGRAM TO GO TO.

03:20:29.050 --> 03:20:31.185
APARTMENT THAT AREN'T BILL WELL

03:20:31.252 --> 03:20:34.288

ABSOLUTELY YEAH I. AND I HAD

03:20:37.158 --> 03:20:38.860
SORRY TO INTERRUPT PRESENT

03:20:38.926 --> 03:20:40.561
VIRGIN MEMBER CHIANG IF I COULD

03:20:40.628 --> 03:20:43.498
I WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM OF THE

03:20:43.564 --> 03:20:44.632
FOUR FULLER TEN IF THIS IS THE

03:20:44.699 --> 03:20:46.667
CASE BUT IN THE EIGHTIES

03:20:46.734 --> 03:20:47.735
RELATED TO THE EIGHTY FOUR

03:20:47.802 --> 03:20:50.605
OLYMPICS BOTH CAL STATE LA CAL

03:20:50.671 --> 03:20:52.273
STATE DOMINGUEZ SENATE MAY BE

03:20:52.340 --> 03:20:54.442
THE SAME AT FULLERTON. THERE

03:20:54.509 --> 03:20:55.376
WAS HOUSING BUILT FOR THE

03:20:55.443 --> 03:20:57.278
OLYMPICS AND IT WAS WOOD FRAME

03:20:57.345 --> 03:20:59.080
AND NOT THE BEST CONSTRUCTION

03:20:59.147 --> 03:21:01.382
WENT UP PRETTY QUICKLY AND BOTH

03:21:01.449 --> 03:21:03.017
CAL STATE LA AND TO MAKE A

03:21:03.084 --> 03:21:04.185
CELLS WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE

03:21:04.252 --> 03:21:05.887
THEIR HOUSING THAT CAME IN WITH

03:21:05.953 --> 03:21:07.488

PRESIDENT VIRTUES MENTIONING IS

03:21:10.391 --> 03:21:12.126
THE SAME SO WOOD FRAME NOT

03:21:12.193 --> 03:21:13.461
GREAT CONSTRUCTION SO WE WOULD

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:15.329
AGREE ON A PERCENT ON A BETTER

03:21:15.396 --> 03:21:18.766
CONSTRUCTION COMMONSENSE THAT

03:21:18.833 --> 03:21:19.367
SOUNDS LIKE THOSE ARE THREE.

03:21:19.434 --> 03:21:20.835
BUILDINGS BUILT PERHAPS FOR

03:21:20.902 --> 03:21:22.637
TEMPORARY GAVE THANKS FOR WHAT

03:21:22.703 --> 03:21:23.504
YOU WERE BILLED WITH. A

03:21:23.571 --> 03:21:25.673
TEMPORARY HOUSING IN MIND NOT.

03:21:25.740 --> 03:21:28.075
LONG TERM HOUSING- I JUST WANNA

03:21:28.142 --> 03:21:29.911
MAKE SURE THAT ANY MONEY.

03:21:29.977 --> 03:21:32.046
THAT'S BEING USED AT THIS FROM

03:21:32.113 --> 03:21:33.047
THE STATE FROM THE GRANT

03:21:33.114 --> 03:21:35.249
PROGRAM. IS NOT GOING TO BE

03:21:35.316 --> 03:21:39.020
BUILT FOR HOUSING THAT'S ONLY

03:21:39.086 --> 03:21:39.620
GOING TO LAST FOR. THIRTY FIVE

03:21:39.687 --> 03:21:42.890
YEARS. AT MIDNIGHT IT IS A

03:21:42.957 --> 03:21:44.225
CHALLENGE FOR US ESPECIALLY

03:21:44.292 --> 03:21:46.861
THOSE CAMPUSES THAT. MAY NOT BE

03:21:46.928 --> 03:21:49.997
ABLE TO- CHARGE THE RENTAL

03:21:50.064 --> 03:21:51.899
RATES TO FORWARD STAY A STEEL

03:21:51.966 --> 03:21:53.468
FRAME BUILDINGS SO WE HAVE

03:21:53.534 --> 03:21:55.069
ENDED UP WITH SOME WOOD FRAME

03:21:55.136 --> 03:21:56.737
BUILDINGS FOR STEEL. AND

03:21:56.804 --> 03:21:58.439
CERTAINLY THE LONGER TERM WOULD

03:21:58.506 --> 03:22:00.575
BE A PRE CAST FACILITY WHICH IS

03:22:00.641 --> 03:22:02.543
VERY DIFFICULT TO FORT SO I

03:22:02.610 --> 03:22:04.078
APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND

03:22:04.145 --> 03:22:05.446
THAT'S KIND OF REFLECTS THE

03:22:05.513 --> 03:22:07.114
ECONOMICS BELT CAMPUSES TRY TO

03:22:07.181 --> 03:22:09.550
BALANCE WITH THE- THE RATES AND

03:22:09.617 --> 03:22:12.119
THE LOCAL MARKET. AND THE OTHER

03:22:12.186 --> 03:22:13.688
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WOULD

03:22:13.754 --> 03:22:14.856
SAY SOME WOMEN AT CHIANG IS

03:22:14.922 --> 03:22:17.625
THAT THEY THE GOOD NEWS IS-

03:22:17.692 --> 03:22:18.860
WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF OUR

03:22:18.926 --> 03:22:20.528
CONSTRUCTION OF OUR FACE FOR AS

03:22:20.595 --> 03:22:21.996
I SAID WHICH S A BUILDING THAT

03:22:22.063 --> 03:22:24.532
IS- STATE OF THE ART AND- WELL

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:25.967
HAD AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO

03:22:26.033 --> 03:22:29.237
DO IS REPLACE THIS OLD-

03:22:29.303 --> 03:22:31.138
BUILDING THAT. AS I SAID IS

03:22:31.205 --> 03:22:34.175
UNSAFE WITH EXACTLY THE SAME-

03:22:34.242 --> 03:22:35.610
TYPE OF BUILDING SO THE QUALITY

03:22:35.676 --> 03:22:37.178
OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND THEY

03:22:37.245 --> 03:22:40.548
DEL USEFUL LIFE WILL BE MUCH

03:22:40.615 --> 03:22:42.049
LONGER. YOU SHOULD I JUST I

03:22:42.116 --> 03:22:43.217
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THIS POINT

03:22:43.284 --> 03:22:45.520
JUST BECAUSE- ON. HOW WANT TO

03:22:45.586 --> 03:22:46.554
BE SURE THAT WERE. YOU KNOW

03:22:46.621 --> 03:22:48.089
INVESTING IN THE FUTURE WE'RE

03:22:48.155 --> 03:22:50.024
NOT JUST YOU KNOW PORN DOWN.

03:22:50.091 --> 03:22:52.193
POUR MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.

03:22:52.260 --> 03:22:53.661
EXACTLY RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE

03:22:53.728 --> 03:22:54.695
THAT WE KNOW WE LOOK AT

03:22:54.762 --> 03:22:56.664
RENOVATING THIS THIS BUILDING

03:22:56.731 --> 03:22:58.232
AND IT JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE

03:22:58.299 --> 03:22:59.033
TO DO IT. FOR THAT EXACT

03:22:59.100 --> 03:23:01.168
REASON. KNOWN UNDERSTOOD BUT I

03:23:01.235 --> 03:23:03.204
THINK THE- THE QUESTION IS WHY

03:23:03.271 --> 03:23:04.805
DID IT MAKE SENSE TO BUILD IT

03:23:04.872 --> 03:23:06.707
THAT WAY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

03:23:06.774 --> 03:23:08.442
