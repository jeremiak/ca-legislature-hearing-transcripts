PROFOUND WE FOUND WAS THAT MORE

THAN HALF OF PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.574 region:rollup2

ASSISTANCE OF A DIAPER BANK THE

00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:22.254 region:rollup2

00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:32.931 region:rollup2
OF THE MOST.

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.100 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT.

00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:36.635 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.836 region:rollup2
OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION THAT THE

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.937 region:rollup2
INDICATOR THAT CAN INDICATE

00:25:37.836 --> 00:25:40.639 region:rollup2
WHETHER OR NOT A PARENT WILL

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:42.174 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE MATERNAL DEPRESSION A

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:46.011 region:rollup2
PATERNAL DEPRESSION.

00:25:42.174 --> 00:25:47.479 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY LACK OF DIAPER.

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:49.248 region:rollup2
HELPED LACK OF DIAPERS FOR

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:50.582 region:rollup2
THEIR INFANT.

00:25:49.248 --> 00:25:52.184 region:rollup2
THIS WAS PROFOUND TO ME

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:53.852 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY HAVING SPENT TWENTY

00:25:52.184 --> 00:25:55.487 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THE ANTI HUNGER.

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:56.155 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:58.991 region:rollup2
THAT LACK OF FOOD.

00:25:56.155 --> 00:26:00.859 region:rollup2
BUT THAT CAME IN SECOND.

00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:02.361 region:rollup2
SECOND TO NOT HAVING ENOUGH

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:04.530 region:rollup2
DIAPERS AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT

00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:06.632 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:08.434 region:rollup2
IS FOR A CHILD ON THAT THAT HAS

00:26:06.632 --> 00:26:10.469 region:rollup2
A PARENT WHO IS DEPRESSED THEY

00:26:08.434 --> 00:26:12.037 region:rollup2
ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ENGAGED AS

00:26:10.469 --> 00:26:13.372 region:rollup2
AN INFANT. LESS LIKELY TO BE

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.740 region:rollup2
HAPPY THEY HAVE STRESS

00:26:13.372 --> 00:26:15.908 region:rollup2
INDICATORS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:17.443 region:rollup2
OTHER INFANTS.

00:26:15.908 --> 00:26:19.478 region:rollup2
AT THE BEGINNING EXPERIENCING

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:22.514 region:rollup2

A HIGH COST COUNTY.

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:49.814 region:rollup2
THE FIRST HURT ON PAGE TWO SHOWS

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.249 region:rollup2
OF THE CUPBOARDS GRANTS HAVE

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:53.852 region:rollup2
LOST MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ITS

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:54.486 region:rollup2
VALUE SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:35:53.852 --> 00:35:55.353 region:rollup2
OF CAL WORKS IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:35:54.486 --> 00:35:56.688 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:58.690 region:rollup2
DURING THIS PERIOD STATE

00:35:56.688 --> 00:35:59.791 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS FRICKLEY SUSPENDED

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.292 region:rollup2

THE COLA.

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.563 region:rollup2
THIS ENSURED THE COOLER ENSURES

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:06.998 region:rollup2
THAT THE VALUE THE GRANTS KEEP

00:36:05.563 --> 00:36:08.366 region:rollup2
PACE WITH INFLATION.

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.501 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION POLICYMAKERS ALSO

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:11.269 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE GRANT LEVELS DURING

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:12.671 region:rollup2
THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH ALSO

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:14.439 region:rollup2
ERODED THE VALUE OF COVER

00:36:12.671 --> 00:36:15.640 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE TODAY.

00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:17.275 region:rollup2
THE POLICY MAKERS HAD INCREASE

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.910 region:rollup2
GRANT LEVELS ANNUALLY TO ACCOUNT

00:36:17.275 --> 00:36:20.278 region:rollup2
FOR INFLATION THE MAXIM CAO

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.713 region:rollup2
GROUP WITH CAL WORKS GRANT. BE

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:22.947 region:rollup2
ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND

00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:24.115 region:rollup2
THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER MONTH IN

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:25.717 region:rollup2
THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:28.887 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DOLLARS

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:30.388 region:rollup2
HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSED

00:36:28.887 --> 00:36:32.757 region:rollup2
PROPOSED VALUE OF JUST SEVEN

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:34.292 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS.

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:36.194 region:rollup2
FEELING THE MUSCLE INCREASE

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:37.595 region:rollup2
GRANTS FOR INFLATION EACH YEAR.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.363 region:rollup2
SEVERELY PRODUCES THE RESOURCES

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:39.597 region:rollup2
THAT PARENTS COULD USE TO

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:42.967 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE FAMILY OR

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:43.768 region:rollup2
PAY THEIR RENT.

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.236 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE A VEST AND CAL WORKS

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:46.204 region:rollup2
GRANTS IS EXPRESSLY TROUBLING

00:36:45.236 --> 00:36:47.739 region:rollup2
WHEN COMPARED TO THE COST OF

00:36:46.204 --> 00:36:49.040 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. THE CHART

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:50.875 region:rollup2
ON PAGE THREE SHOWS THAT THE

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.278 region:rollup2
MEDIAN RENT AND HIGH COST

00:36:50.875 --> 00:36:54.412 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAS FAR OUTPACED CAO

00:36:53.278 --> 00:36:55.380 region:rollup2
WORKS GRANTS IN RECENT YEARS.

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:56.981 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THE CAL WORKS GRANT

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.716 region:rollup2
FALLS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:36:56.981 --> 00:37:00.885 region:rollup2
FOUR DOLLARS SHORT OF THE COST

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:02.754 region:rollup2
OF COVERING A TWO BEDROOM RENTAL

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:04.456 region:rollup2
AND HIGH COST COUNTY.

00:37:02.754 --> 00:37:06.257 region:rollup2
EVEN A LOW COST COUNTY SUCH AS

00:37:04.456 --> 00:37:07.926 region:rollup2
FRESNO FOR SACRAMENTO MEDIAN

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.560 region:rollup2
RENTS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:09.461 region:rollup2
CAL WORKS GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.729 region:rollup2
THREE.

00:37:09.461 --> 00:37:12.063 region:rollup2
THE CALYX GRANDPA'S THREE

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:13.898 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:16.601 region:rollup2
SHORT OF THE MEDIAN RENT FOR TWO

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.969 region:rollup2
BEDROOM HOME IN THOSE COUNTIES.

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:19.838 region:rollup2
BECAUSE COVERS GRANTS HAVE LOST

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:21.973 region:rollup2
VALUE MAXIMUM CAO WORKS GRANT IN

00:37:19.838 --> 00:37:23.742 region:rollup2
HIGH COST COUNTY FILL SO THE

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:25.777 region:rollup2
FAMILIES OUT OF THE POVERTY. THE

00:37:23.742 --> 00:37:26.377 region:rollup2
POVERTY IS DEFINED AS FIFTY

00:37:25.777 --> 00:37:27.979 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:29.781 region:rollup2
LINE. AND THAT MEANS FOR A

00:37:27.979 --> 00:37:31.716 region:rollup2
FAMILY OF THREE. MAKING ENDS

00:37:29.781 --> 00:37:33.151 region:rollup2
MEET ON LESS THAN ELEVEN

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:34.552 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR.

00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:35.920 region:rollup2
IN FACT THE CHART ON PAGE FOUR

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:37.288 region:rollup2
SHOWS THE ABSENT A GREAT

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.923 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:41.159 region:rollup2
THE CAL WORKS GRANT WILL REMAIN

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:42.961 region:rollup2
BELOW THE POVERTY LINE FOR THE

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:44.629 region:rollup2
ELEVENTH STRAIGHT YEAR.

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:46.264 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ANALYZE

MAXIMUM TOWER CAO WORKS GREAT

00:37:46.264 --> 00:37:50.435 region:rollup2
WILL BE JUST FORTY ONE PERCENT

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:51.803 region:rollup2
OF THE FEDERAL PARTY LINE.

00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:53.438 region:rollup2

IN DEEP POVERTY HAS PROFOUND

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:04.949 region:rollup2
EFFECT ON CHILDREN AFFECTING THE

WELL BEING WELL INTO ADULTHOOD.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.318 region:rollup2
BUT EXPERTS CHART SHOW HOW THE

00:38:05.884 --> 00:38:08.887 region:rollup2
MAXIMUM COVERAGE GRANT STACKS UP

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:10.989 region:rollup2
AGAINST POVERTY THRESHOLDS IN

MACAU WORKS CURRENT IS ABOUT

00:38:36.548 --> 00:38:40.385 region:rollup2
HALF OF THIS PARTY THRESHOLD.

00:38:39.417 --> 00:38:41.653 region:rollup2

MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS

00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:52.764 region:rollup2
THAT IT DOES VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.930 region:rollup2
FRESNO IS CONSIDERED A LOW COST

00:39:57.195 --> 00:40:00.298 region:rollup2
COUNTY IN THE COMICS PROGRAM SO

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.666 region:rollup2
THE CELTICS GRANT LEVEL IS LOWER

00:40:00.298 --> 00:40:03.167 region:rollup2
TO REFLECT THIS GEOGRAPHIC

00:40:01.666 --> 00:40:04.736 region:rollup2

IN CONCLUSION THERE IS ABUNDANCE

00:40:14.812 --> 00:40:17.782 region:rollup2
OF EVIDENCE THAT CAL WORKS

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:19.417 region:rollup2

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.233 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT POVERTY IMPOSES A

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:36.934 region:rollup2
VERY STEEP COST ON CHILDREN OR

FROM EXPERTS IN THE STATE WHO

00:41:21.713 --> 00:41:24.983 region:rollup2
ARE DEALING WITH CHILDREN ABOUT.

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:26.317 region:rollup2
THE REALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:28.086 region:rollup2
OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.554 region:rollup2
ON CHILDREN WE ALSO LEARNED THAT

00:41:28.086 --> 00:41:30.788 region:rollup2
LIVING IN POVERTY PARTICULARLY

00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:32.023 region:rollup2
DEEP POVERTY IS AMONG THE MOST

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:33.324 region:rollup2
PERNICIOUS.

00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:34.659 region:rollup2

AND.

00:41:34.659 --> 00:41:37.995 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW BASED ON

00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:40.231 region:rollup2
THAT HEARING ABOUT THE RESEARCH

00:41:37.995 --> 00:41:41.032 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TELLING US FOR AWHILE.

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:42.333 region:rollup2
IN KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THE

00:41:41.032 --> 00:41:43.868 region:rollup2
HIGHEST CHILD POVERTY RATE IN

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:45.603 region:rollup2
THE NATION.

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:47.405 region:rollup2
AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE.

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:48.806 region:rollup2
A DANGEROUSLY HIGH NUMBER OF

00:41:47.405 --> 00:41:49.741 region:rollup2
VERY POOR CHILDREN WHO ARE

00:41:48.806 --> 00:41:51.075 region:rollup2
LIVING IN A STATE OF NEAR

00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:52.710 region:rollup2
DESTITUTION AND THAT WE SHOULD

00:41:51.075 --> 00:41:54.178 region:rollup2
CALL IT WHAT IT IS.

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.780 region:rollup2
I'M AND KNOWING THAT WE CAN DO

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.715 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND NOT

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.484 region:rollup2
DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS JUST

00:41:57.715 --> 00:42:01.252 region:rollup2
SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND THE

00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:02.320 region:rollup2
CURRENT CONDITION.

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:04.989 region:rollup2
THAT CHILDREN THIS PROGRAM LIVE

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.290 region:rollup2
IN IS A STAIN ON OUR STATE.

00:42:04.989 --> 00:42:08.059 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR OF TALKED

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:09.327 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:11.662 region:rollup2
LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY AS A

00:42:09.327 --> 00:42:13.631 region:rollup2
DEVASTATING EFFECT ON CHILDREN.

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:15.333 region:rollup2
IT'S TOXIC STRESS THE DAMAGES

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:16.634 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DEVELOPING BRAINS

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:18.002 region:rollup2
CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY HAD

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:20.171 region:rollup2
NOW AVERAGE OF SEVEN TO TEN

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:21.239 region:rollup2
PERCENT LESS GRAY MATTER. IN THE

00:42:20.171 --> 00:42:22.540 region:rollup2
FRONTAL LOBE TEMPORAL LOBE IN

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.409 region:rollup2
THE HIPPOCAMPUS

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.909 region:rollup2
THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN TIED TO

00:42:24.409 --> 00:42:26.177 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:27.111 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING.

00:42:26.177 --> 00:42:28.846 region:rollup2
THEN CHILDREN WHO WHO ARE NOT

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.314 region:rollup2
POOR.

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.949 region:rollup2
GROWING UP POOR IS A LIFETIME OF

00:42:30.314 --> 00:42:34.085 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IT

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.685 region:rollup2
DECREASES THE LIKELY HAD DICK

00:42:34.085 --> 00:42:36.788 region:rollup2
CHILDREN GRADUATE FROM HIGH

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:37.989 region:rollup2
SCHOOL. IT LESSENS THE

00:42:36.788 --> 00:42:41.292 region:rollup2
LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE.

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:43.094 region:rollup2
GAINFULLY I'M EMPLOYED AND A

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:44.395 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE EARNING ADULTS.

00:42:43.094 --> 00:42:45.897 region:rollup2
ON THEY SUFFER FROM NEGATIVE

HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:48.733 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:51.002 region:rollup2
MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CONTACT WITH

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:53.137 region:rollup2
THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:42:51.002 --> 00:42:53.771 region:rollup2
DEEP POVERTY AND POVERTY FUELS

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.606 region:rollup2
THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:57.108 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:59.143 region:rollup2
POOR CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:42:57.108 --> 00:43:00.745 region:rollup2
BECOME POOR DOLLS.

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:02.046 region:rollup2
NEARLY HALF OF ADULTS WHO ARE

00:43:00.745 --> 00:43:03.848 region:rollup2
PERSISTENTLY POOR DURING THEIR

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:05.149 region:rollup2

THE AGE OF FIVE

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:10.354 region:rollup2
COMPARE TO LESS THAN ONE PERCENT

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:12.523 region:rollup2
OF ADULTS WHO NEVER EXPERIENCED

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:13.891 region:rollup2
POVERTY AS CHILDREN.

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:15.293 region:rollup2
IF WE WANT TO STOP THE CYCLE OF

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:16.527 region:rollup2
POVERTY WE NEED TO STOP HAVING

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:19.163 region:rollup2
KIDS GROWING UP.

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:20.731 region:rollup2
SO DEEPLY IN IT.

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:22.100 region:rollup2
I'M PARTY ALSO AFFECTS THE

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.701 region:rollup2
PARENTS ABILITY TO MOVE FROM

WE LIVE TONIGHT.

00:43:30.842 --> 00:43:34.378 region:rollup2
IT'S DIFFICULT AN UNREASONABLE

00:43:32.543 --> 00:43:36.080 region:rollup2
TO THINK THAT A PERSON LIVING IN

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:38.749 region:rollup2
THAT A SEVERE ECONOMIC

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.551 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCE. CAN FOCUS ON THE

00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:42.120 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL AND JOB READINESS

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.421 region:rollup2
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE CAL

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.956 region:rollup2
WORKS PROGRAMS.

00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:46.023 region:rollup2
OFFERS SO WERE ALSO UNDERMINING

00:43:44.956 --> 00:43:47.892 region:rollup2
WANTED TO KEEP.

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:49.460 region:rollup2
UP.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:50.695 region:rollup2
GOALS OF THE PROGRAM THAT IS

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:53.164 region:rollup2
HELPING PEOPLE MOVE FROM WELFARE

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:55.333 region:rollup2
TO WORK. ON IF WEEK.

00:43:53.164 --> 00:43:57.435 region:rollup2
CONTINUALLY REQUIRED THAT THEY

00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:58.503 region:rollup2
LIVE IN A DEEP STATE OF POVERTY

00:43:57.435 --> 00:44:00.438 region:rollup2
THE GOOD NEWS AS WE KNOW HOW TO

00:43:58.503 --> 00:44:02.106 region:rollup2
REVERSE THE DAMAGE.

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:03.941 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE RESOURCES OF VERY

00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:05.843 region:rollup2
POOR FAMILIES WORKS THE RESEARCH

00:44:03.941 --> 00:44:08.079 region:rollup2
TELLS US.

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:10.248 region:rollup2
THAT IF LOOK AT VERY LOW INCOME

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:12.950 region:rollup2
FAMILIES IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL

00:44:10.248 --> 00:44:13.451 region:rollup2
WELL BEING IT VASTLY IMPROVES

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.852 region:rollup2
THE WELL BEING OF THEIR

00:44:13.451 --> 00:44:16.521 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:18.122 region:rollup2
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EVEN MODEST

THERE'S THERE'S I'M A A NUMBER

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:53.024 region:rollup2
OF EMERGING STUDIES.

00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:54.659 region:rollup2

MONEY FROM INDIAN GAMING?

00:45:03.901 --> 00:45:07.371 region:rollup2
I'M WHAT THEY FOUND THAT EVEN IN

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:08.706 region:rollup2
VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:10.107 region:rollup2

FAMILY FUNCTIONING IMPROVED.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.215 region:rollup2
.

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:18.783 region:rollup2
WE KNOW HOW TO REVERSE AND

00:45:17.215 --> 00:45:21.085 region:rollup2
PREVENT THE EFFECTS OF THE TOXIC

00:45:18.783 --> 00:45:22.820 region:rollup2
STRATHEARN CHILDREN'S BRAINS.

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:24.589 region:rollup2
LET ME LET ME BECAUSE IF I COULD

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:26.157 region:rollup2
BY IMAGINING A SCENARIO WHERE WE

00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:27.391 region:rollup2
KNEW OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR

00:45:26.157 --> 00:45:28.960 region:rollup2
PATHOGEN THAT WAS IN THE AIR IN

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:30.728 region:rollup2
THE WATER.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.797 region:rollup2
AND WE KNEW THE DAMAGE IT DID TO

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
THE BRAINS OF DEVELOPING CHILD.

00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:37.134 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW HOW TO A RACKET.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.436 region:rollup2
ARM WE WOULDN'T HESITATE.

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:40.371 region:rollup2
WE WOULD WE WOULD NOT HESITATE

00:45:38.436 --> 00:45:42.039 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE VALUE CHILDREN AND WE

00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.274 region:rollup2
WANT HEALTHY CHILDREN TO THRIVE

00:45:42.039 --> 00:45:44.909 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR THEM IT'S

00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:45.910 region:rollup2
MORALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:46.444 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.679 region:rollup2
SOCIETY WE KNOW ALL THOSE

00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:49.780 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:51.215 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THE

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.718 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND WE KNOW HOW TO.

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:55.720 region:rollup2
TO FIX IT AND TO NOT DO SO WE

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:56.654 region:rollup2
AYE I THINK IS UNACCEPTABLE WHY

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:58.656 region:rollup2
IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

00:45:56.654 --> 00:46:01.025 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT.

00:45:58.656 --> 00:46:04.128 region:rollup2
MORE CASH ASSISTANCE FOR LOW

00:46:01.025 --> 00:46:05.663 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES I'M IN SPITE OF

00:46:04.128 --> 00:46:07.098 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS

00:46:05.663 --> 00:46:09.133 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WE LEARNED

00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:11.168 region:rollup2
JUST YESTERDAY. I THINK REALLY

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:12.837 region:rollup2
GETS TO OUR MANY OF THE ISMS

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:14.305 region:rollup2
THAT UNDERLIE A LOT OF THAT.

00:46:12.837 --> 00:46:15.840 region:rollup2
WELFARE STEREOTYPES THAT HAVE

00:46:14.305 --> 00:46:17.475 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZED THE NATIONAL

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.810 region:rollup2
DEBATE OVER THE PROGRAM.

00:46:17.475 --> 00:46:21.612 region:rollup2
BUT KNOWING WHAT WE NOW NOT

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.747 region:rollup2
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IS AND.

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:24.448 region:rollup2
AS I SAID BEFORE A FEW TIMES IS

00:46:22.747 --> 00:46:26.484 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:28.352 region:rollup2
WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE AND THE

00:46:26.484 --> 00:46:29.253 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION TO WORK TOGETHER

00:46:28.352 --> 00:46:31.155 region:rollup2

WE BROUGHT TO THEM AS WELL.

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:17.728 region:rollup2
A.

00:48:15.926 --> 00:48:18.929 region:rollup2
I DID GO TO SCHOOL.

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:22.967 region:rollup2
BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:25.336 region:rollup2
MY PARENTS.

00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:28.572 region:rollup2
BEING INVOLVED.

00:48:25.336 --> 00:48:29.573 region:rollup2
IN MY EDUCATION. I WOULD HIDE

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:31.976 region:rollup2
FOOD IN MY CLOSET.

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:35.546 region:rollup2
.

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:37.281 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNEW.

00:48:35.546 --> 00:48:40.384 region:rollup2
THAT I WOULDN'T GET MEALS.

00:48:37.281 --> 00:48:42.086 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHEN

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:47.591 region:rollup2
MY STOMACH WAS HURTING. I WOULD

00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:49.193 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT.

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:51.328 region:rollup2

00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:02.306 region:rollup2
I WAS THERE.

00:48:59.036 --> 00:49:04.642 region:rollup2
IN THIS CHILDHOOD.

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:07.211 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AND NO ONE'S SEEN ME.

00:49:04.642 --> 00:49:08.646 region:rollup2
EVEN AS YOUNG AS FIVE OR SIX

00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:10.314 region:rollup2
YEARS OLD FOR. I WOULD SIT IN

00:49:08.646 --> 00:49:13.584 region:rollup2
CLASS.

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
AND I REMEMBER MY.

00:49:13.584 --> 00:49:18.489 region:rollup2
HUNGER WAS SO PAINFUL. AND I

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:22.626 region:rollup2
WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A PAINFUL GROW

00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:24.628 region:rollup2
IN MY STOMACH.

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:26.363 region:rollup2
I COULDN'T WAIT FOR LUNCH.

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:27.465 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT. WAS THE

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:31.602 region:rollup2
ONLY GOOD MAIL THAT I WOULD

00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:33.971 region:rollup2
RECEIVE.

00:49:31.602 --> 00:49:35.806 region:rollup2
GROWING UP.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:40.411 region:rollup2
ALL I CRAVED THAT WAS TO BE

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:44.181 region:rollup2
NORMAL FOR.

00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:48.452 region:rollup2
INSUFFICIENT WITH OTHER KIDS.

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:49.420 region:rollup2
AS A MOTHER OF TWO KIDS.

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:52.690 region:rollup2
I TURNED TO CAL OR.

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:54.058 region:rollup2

.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.371 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HOUSING IN CONTRA COSTA

00:50:05.002 --> 00:50:09.540 region:rollup2
COUNTY IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FOR.

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:12.209 region:rollup2
FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IT IS.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.078 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN HUNDRED.

00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:19.550 region:rollup2
THE CASH AID I RECEIVED.

00:50:14.078 --> 00:50:22.653 region:rollup2
WENT TO UTILITIES FOOD AND GAS.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:24.088 region:rollup2
.

00:50:22.653 --> 00:50:25.589 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO WAY I COULD AFFORD

00:50:24.088 --> 00:50:26.891 region:rollup2
LIVING ON MY OWN.

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.725 region:rollup2
IT WAS

00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:29.326 region:rollup2
CASH GRANT.

00:50:27.725 --> 00:50:32.196 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:35.266 region:rollup2
REYES.

00:50:32.196 --> 00:50:37.868 region:rollup2
IF THE CASH GRANT WAS RAISED.

00:50:35.266 --> 00:50:39.403 region:rollup2
WHAT I WOULD DO ON HONESTLY?

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:40.938 region:rollup2
IS TO PROVIDE.

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:43.607 region:rollup2
MY ELDEST SON.

00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:45.609 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOES.

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:46.844 region:rollup2
HE WOULD GO AROUND.

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:48.412 region:rollup2
WHICH SHOES THAT DIDN'T FIT HIM

00:50:46.844 --> 00:50:51.348 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:54.218 region:rollup2
THAT HAD HOLES ON THE BOTTOM.

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:58.355 region:rollup2
AND HIS SOCKS WOULD GET WET.

00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:59.423 region:rollup2
IN THE WINTER.

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:03.627 region:rollup2
BOYS GROW.

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:06.263 region:rollup2
SO FAST.

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:11.135 region:rollup2
ALMOST EVERY MONTH IT SEEMS.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:12.736 region:rollup2
ARUM.

00:51:11.135 --> 00:51:14.939 region:rollup2

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:16.707 region:rollup2
HE OFTEN GOT TEASED.

00:51:14.939 --> 00:51:19.743 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW.

00:51:16.707 --> 00:51:21.478 region:rollup2
THE IN SHOES ARE YOU KNOW PANTS

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:23.480 region:rollup2
THAT FIT HIM WELL.

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:25.049 region:rollup2
I AM.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.450 region:rollup2
IN IT BROUGHT ME BACK TO WHEN I

00:51:25.049 --> 00:51:28.452 region:rollup2
WAS A KID.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:32.423 region:rollup2
I WAS.

I SAW A LOT OF THOSE KIDS AND.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:57.787 region:rollup2
WANTED TO TAKE EVERYBODY HOME

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.122 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:59.689 region:rollup2
WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE HAD

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.391 region:rollup2
SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN BY NOW.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:05.428 region:rollup2
AND.

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:06.963 region:rollup2

01:06:05.428 --> 01:06:08.765 region:rollup2
NOT JUST AS A TEACHER BUT AS A

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:11.234 region:rollup2
HUMAN BEING TO SEE KIDS

STRUGGLING AND I CAN RELATE TO

01:06:11.234 --> 01:06:13.470 region:rollup2
THE STORY ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH

QUITE FRANKLY TRYING TO HAVE

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.117 region:rollup2
WITH THE OTHER KIDS HAD WAS

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:30.153 region:rollup2

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:31.120 region:rollup2
EMBARRASSING AND SO I APPRECIATE

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.789 region:rollup2

KNOW WE SAY IT'S TIME EVERY TIME

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:47.770 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:48.371 region:rollup2
WE DO KEEP.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.074 region:rollup2
.

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:52.242 region:rollup2
KIDS IN THE FOREFRONT WE TALK

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:54.310 region:rollup2
ABOUT MOVING CALIFORNIA FORWARD

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:56.346 region:rollup2
AND HOW KIDS IN THE EDUCATION

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:58.214 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS BUT

01:06:56.346 --> 01:07:00.783 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T HAVE. CHILDREN THAT

01:06:58.214 --> 01:07:02.318 region:rollup2
HAVE A HOME TO GO TO FOOD TO EAT

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.953 region:rollup2
THEN YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR TALK IS

JUST TALK.

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:06.923 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE KICKED WE CAN'T MOVE

CALIFORNIA FORWARD IF WE CAN

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:10.727 region:rollup2
EDUCATE KIDS WE CAN EDUCATE KIDS

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:12.295 region:rollup2
IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOOD THEY

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:13.730 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. SO

THANK YOU AGAIN AND I APPRECIATE

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.198 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS AND I KNOW WE'RE

ALL HERE.

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:18.067 region:rollup2
IN FOR THE SAME REASON I'M THE

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:19.369 region:rollup2
CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES IN THE

01:07:18.067 --> 01:07:21.437 region:rollup2
STORIES THAT I HEAR.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:23.206 region:rollup2
AND IN MY COMMITTEE AS WELL ARE

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:24.741 region:rollup2
ARE QUITE FRANKLY DISTURBING

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.309 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE THE SIX LARGEST

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:27.477 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND YET

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:29.479 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:07:27.477 --> 01:07:29.712 region:rollup2
ABOUT. MOVING CHILDREN OUT OF

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.780 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:32.348 region:rollup2
.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:33.516 region:rollup2
IN AND I LOOK THROUGH THE REPORT

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:35.518 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS THE ELEVENTH

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:37.820 region:rollup2
STRAIGHT YEAR WE HAVE NOT A. WE

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:38.988 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE BEEN BELOW THE POVERTY

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:41.758 region:rollup2
BUT THE POVERTY LINE WE HAVEN'T.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:45.228 region:rollup2
INCREASED.

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:46.596 region:rollup2
THE GROUNDS OF THE I'M FROM LA

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:49.165 region:rollup2
COUNTY AND IN LA COUNTY. THE.

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:50.533 region:rollup2
.

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.767 region:rollup2
LIVING THOUGH THE RENTS HAVE

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:53.202 region:rollup2
ALMOST.

01:07:50.767 --> 01:07:54.571 region:rollup2
TRIPLED IN IN THE LAST THIRTY

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:56.072 region:rollup2
YEARS.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:58.675 region:rollup2
PROBABLY MORE I'VE JUST IN MY

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:00.343 region:rollup2
AREA AND WE CAN'T WE HAVE I KNOW

01:07:58.675 --> 01:08:02.045 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T KEEP UP.

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:03.746 region:rollup2
WITH THE LEVEL OF OF THE

01:08:02.045 --> 01:08:05.782 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN RENTS BUT IF WE CAN

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.849 region:rollup2
DO SOMETHING FOR THESE CHILDREN

01:08:05.782 --> 01:08:07.050 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THIS SOLUTION

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.518 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:10.920 region:rollup2
.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:12.488 region:rollup2
THE THESE HOW SUBSIDIZE HOMES

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.724 region:rollup2
BUT ABOUT ALSO BRING STIGMA TO

01:08:12.488 --> 01:08:15.925 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE FAMILIES THAT YOU

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:18.828 region:rollup2
KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS SECTION

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.862 region:rollup2
EIGHT. ARM CHILD THAT'S ALSO

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.463 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:23.633 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC FOR THE CHILDREN AND

01:08:20.463 --> 01:08:25.435 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO EMBARRASSING AND SO I.

01:08:23.633 --> 01:08:27.270 region:rollup2
WE WANT US TO LOOK AT THIS WITH

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:29.272 region:rollup2
THE BEST INTENTIONS OBVIOUSLY

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:31.374 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:33.910 region:rollup2
CAN PROVIDE THESE WITH THE LAST.

01:08:31.374 --> 01:08:36.446 region:rollup2
BUT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF OF OF A

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:37.714 region:rollup2
STIGMA TO THE FAMILIES. AGAIN I

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.082 region:rollup2
DO APPRECIATE BOTH THE.

01:08:37.714 --> 01:08:40.550 region:rollup2
THE COMMENT ABOUT THE US

01:08:39.082 --> 01:08:43.453 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZE HOMES BY.

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.554 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO PART OF THE TRAUMA

01:08:43.453 --> 01:08:46.222 region:rollup2
THAT WERE IMPOSING ON SOME OF

01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:47.857 region:rollup2
THESE KIDS AND FAMILIES AT THAT

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:49.592 region:rollup2
NOW NOT ONLY ARE YOU ARE CAL

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:50.960 region:rollup2
WORKS AND CAL FRAZIER. FAMILY

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:52.729 region:rollup2
BUT YOU'RE ALSO A SECTION EIGHT

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.297 region:rollup2
FAMILY AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:55.264 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THIS

01:08:54.297 --> 01:08:57.266 region:rollup2
WITHOUT.

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:58.134 region:rollup2
ADDING TO THE BURDEN ONTO THESE

01:08:57.266 --> 01:09:01.504 region:rollup2
FAMILIES I THINK YOU.

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:04.507 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:09:01.504 --> 01:09:07.310 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATH.

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:09.412 region:rollup2
SO.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.680 region:rollup2
LET ME START OFF WITH.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:12.281 region:rollup2
CORRECT IN ALL OF YOU WE ARE THE

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.216 region:rollup2
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:14.517 region:rollup2
WORLD.

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.385 region:rollup2
I ACCORDING TO WHAT THE

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:17.053 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR SAID.

01:09:15.385 --> 01:09:19.055 region:rollup2
.

01:09:17.053 --> 01:09:20.256 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:22.992 region:rollup2
QUITE FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:24.794 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE THE PROPOSAL'S TODAY

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:25.928 region:rollup2
MY BELIEF IS THAT WE NEED TO.

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.196 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT WAS CUT IN TWO

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.498 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE AND GET IT ALL

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:29.666 region:rollup2
BACK.

01:09:28.498 --> 01:09:31.434 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.935 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THAT WE WEREN'T THE

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:33.936 region:rollup2
FIFTH LARGEST WE WERE BELOW THAT

01:09:32.935 --> 01:09:35.438 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO STEP UP

01:09:33.936 --> 01:09:39.075 region:rollup2
OUR GAME IS A STATE START TAKING

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:41.077 region:rollup2
CARE OF OUR FAMILIES.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:42.712 region:rollup2
WITH THAT SAID.

01:09:41.077 --> 01:09:45.214 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES THE STATE

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:46.716 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

01:09:45.214 --> 01:09:48.351 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.453 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:51.120 region:rollup2
WITH WE WE'VE DONE THESE

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:53.189 region:rollup2
MEASURES THAT WOULD THESE THINGS

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.258 region:rollup2
HAS HAPPENED BUT YET WE STILL

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.660 region:rollup2
HAVE THESE HUGE GAPS.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:59.028 region:rollup2
SO. WHAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS

01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.897 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE HOW HOW

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:02.432 region:rollup2
IS THAT ACTUALLY HELPS?

01:10:00.897 --> 01:10:03.900 region:rollup2
VERSUS HURT VERSUS SPREAD THAT

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:06.169 region:rollup2
POVERTY GAP.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.336 region:rollup2
SINCE WE HAVE DONE THAT.

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:09.272 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THE

01:10:07.336 --> 01:10:11.040 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ON THAT.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:12.575 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WHEN THAT CAME

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.310 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT WAS YOU NOW WE RISE

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:15.111 region:rollup2
ALL SHIPS AND MY CONCERN WAS

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.913 region:rollup2
WILL SOME OF THE SHIPS ARE GOING

01:10:15.111 --> 01:10:18.915 region:rollup2
TO SEEK.

01:10:16.913 --> 01:10:19.415 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THOSE THAT DON'T DO

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:22.218 region:rollup2
WELL OUR OUR FAMILIES IN

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:23.653 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.887 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.988 region:rollup2
TO THE JOB AND IF THEY DO GET

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.556 region:rollup2
THE JOB AND THEY GET CUT OFF THE

01:10:25.988 --> 01:10:28.558 region:rollup2
BENEFITS THEY FALL DOWN THE

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:31.527 region:rollup2
CLASS.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:32.895 region:rollup2
AND EVEN IN A WORSE POSITION.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:34.163 region:rollup2
I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MY FAMILY

IT'S A HARD PATH.

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:53.616 region:rollup2
.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:57.820 region:rollup2

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:59.655 region:rollup2
A LOT WITH ALL THE ACES SCORES.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:01.557 region:rollup2
ONE OF MY COMMENTS IN THAT

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:03.626 region:rollup2
HEARING WAS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

01:11:01.557 --> 01:11:05.628 region:rollup2
AT IT IN MIND COURAGE AND WHAT I

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.195 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE BACK FOR DEPARTMENT

01:11:05.628 --> 01:11:07.396 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE IN THE ALLEY ó ON

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:09.132 region:rollup2

OF OUR FAMILIES HAVE MULTIPLE

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.770 region:rollup2
SOCIAL WORKERS THAT TRACK THEM

01:11:12.635 --> 01:11:17.140 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:20.376 region:rollup2
IN DIFFERENT SILOS WE DON'T NEED

01:11:17.140 --> 01:11:21.677 region:rollup2
FOR TWO THREE AND FOUR.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:24.447 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SOCIAL WORKERS

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:26.949 region:rollup2
TRACKING ONE FAMILY.

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:28.417 region:rollup2
COMPLETE WASTE OF FONTS.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:30.887 region:rollup2
WE CAN TAKE THAT WE CAN SPREAD

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:32.321 region:rollup2
THAT OUT WE CAN HAVE ONE PERSON.

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.289 region:rollup2
TRACK THESE FAMILIES IN TRACK

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:35.458 region:rollup2
THESE CHILDREN'S THROUGH A

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.226 region:rollup2
LIFETIME.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:38.895 region:rollup2
IN DECREASE CASELOADS AND MAKE

01:11:37.226 --> 01:11:39.495 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:41.497 region:rollup2
GETTING THE ADEQUATE THE HELP

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:43.166 region:rollup2
THAT THEY NEED. SO LESS OF THEM

01:11:41.497 --> 01:11:44.367 region:rollup2
ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS.

01:11:43.166 --> 01:11:47.103 region:rollup2
AND I QUITE FRANKLY THINK THAT

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:49.605 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A MUCH MUCH BETTER USE.

01:11:47.103 --> 01:11:50.940 region:rollup2
OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:52.241 region:rollup2
SAID IN THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.043 region:rollup2
KNOW I'VE I'VE READ TO CHILDREN

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:56.012 region:rollup2
WITH DISABILITIES A I SAY QUITE

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.879 region:rollup2
A BED.

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:59.081 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD AND I YOU PROGRAM MANY

01:11:56.879 --> 01:11:59.715 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO THREE AND FOUR SOCIAL

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:03.286 region:rollup2
WORKERS THAT ARE TRACKING YOUR

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:04.820 region:rollup2
CHILD. IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHY.

01:12:03.286 --> 01:12:05.755 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL THERE AYE I KNOW

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.789 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ALL THERE BECAUSE THEY

01:12:05.755 --> 01:12:07.990 region:rollup2
CARE ABOUT MY CHILDREN IN THE

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.592 region:rollup2
CARE OF ALL YOUR CHILDREN HER

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:11.060 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS.

01:12:09.592 --> 01:12:12.895 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T NEED MULTIPLE ONES

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.197 region:rollup2
DOING THE SAME THING.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:15.464 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.699 region:rollup2
FAMILY THAT COULD BE GETTING THE

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:18.634 region:rollup2
HELP THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:20.036 region:rollup2
GETTING.

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:21.170 region:rollup2
YOU COULD BE ONE MORE FAMILY.

01:12:20.036 --> 01:12:22.371 region:rollup2
GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.172 region:rollup2
NEED MAKING SURE THAT THAT

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:25.975 region:rollup2
FAMILY DOESN'T FALL THROUGH THE

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:27.476 region:rollup2
CRACKS.

01:12:25.975 --> 01:12:28.277 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

01:12:27.476 --> 01:12:31.013 region:rollup2
TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE ARE.

01:12:28.277 --> 01:12:33.349 region:rollup2
FAR.

01:12:31.013 --> 01:12:34.617 region:rollup2
FAR OVERLY SIDELOAD.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:35.918 region:rollup2
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:37.486 region:rollup2
THE AGENCIES AND THERE NEEDS TO

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:38.087 region:rollup2
BE BETTER COMMUNICATION AND

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:40.256 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS NEED TO BE LOOKED

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:41.324 region:rollup2
AT SO I. REALLY WOULD LIKE TO

01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.959 region:rollup2
SEE THE NUMBERS BACK

01:12:41.324 --> 01:12:45.561 region:rollup2
WHEN WE GET BACK IN MAY ON

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:47.663 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. THAT WOULD RESEMBLE A

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:48.965 region:rollup2
WAY TO CUT THAT BACK ORDER.

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:50.766 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT OF WAY WERE WE SHOULD

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.101 region:rollup2
REFORM THAT.

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:54.570 region:rollup2
SO THAT WITH THESE FAMILIES ARE

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:55.171 region:rollup2

AND WE ONLY HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT

01:12:58.174 --> 01:13:00.309 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE THE FIFTH

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:02.044 region:rollup2
LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:03.045 region:rollup2

MINIMUM WAGE IN THAT.

01:13:53.129 --> 01:13:55.598 region:rollup2

VERY LITTLE EMPLOYMENT HISTORY

01:14:17.653 --> 01:14:21.691 region:rollup2
AND VERY LITTLE.

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:24.026 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL HISTORY LANGUAGE.

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:25.561 region:rollup2

ALL THE STRESS THAT THE TEND

01:14:28.297 --> 01:14:31.434 region:rollup2
INTO THAT.

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:34.203 region:rollup2
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:36.205 region:rollup2
CAN WE OFFER SOME GOOD SERVICES.

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:37.840 region:rollup2
AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE THEM

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.709 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.777 region:rollup2
BUT GETTING OUT OF THE CRISIS

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:42.745 region:rollup2
OF VERY DEEP POVERTY IS IS OFTEN

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:44.480 region:rollup2
A PREREQUISITE TO BE ABLE TO

TAKE ADVANTAGE.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.049 region:rollup2
OF THOSE SERVICES AND THAT IF

YOU GET THE SERVICES YOU CAN GET

01:14:47.049 --> 01:14:49.752 region:rollup2
THE JOB AND THEN WHAT YOU GET

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
THE JOB YOU GET THE BENEFIT.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:52.888 region:rollup2
OF A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE OR

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.758 region:rollup2
YOU GET THE BENEFIT OF AN EARNED

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:56.993 region:rollup2
INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO WE'VE YOU

01:14:55.758 --> 01:14:58.794 region:rollup2
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE FOLKS

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:59.395 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ENTRUSTED TO MOVE

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:01.397 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK.

01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:03.599 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:15:01.397 --> 01:15:05.701 region:rollup2
EIGHT YOU ARM IT'S AN IMPEDIMENT

01:15:03.599 --> 01:15:07.703 region:rollup2
TO THE TO THE GOAL OF MOVING

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:08.871 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK IF

01:15:07.703 --> 01:15:11.273 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T LIFT UP.

01:15:08.871 --> 01:15:13.676 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THAT THAT THE FLOOR IN

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:15.878 region:rollup2
WHICH VERY POOR FAMILIES LIVE SO

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:18.647 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCING

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:20.182 region:rollup2
SUCH A DEGREE OF TOXIC STRESS.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:22.952 region:rollup2
THAT AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:24.120 region:rollup2
IF IF TODAY'S GOAL IS WHERE MY

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:27.356 region:rollup2
LEVIN TONIGHT BEHIND BEATING MY

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:29.458 region:rollup2

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:32.194 region:rollup2
IT'S TOUGH TO TO IT TO MAKE IT A

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:34.730 region:rollup2
PRIORITY.

01:15:32.194 --> 01:15:36.198 region:rollup2
AND FOR CHILDREN WHO GROW UP IN

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:38.300 region:rollup2
THOSE ENVIRONMENTS.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.803 region:rollup2
THE DAMAGE THAT TALKED THE

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.371 region:rollup2
TOXIC OF POVERTY DOES TO THEM

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:44.507 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THEIR BRAINS

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.775 region:rollup2
WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH. MAKES

01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:48.544 region:rollup2
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:49.345 region:rollup2
TO. THEIR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:52.214 region:rollup2
IS POOR THEIR EMPLOYMENT.

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:53.616 region:rollup2
.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:55.785 region:rollup2
SORT OF OUTCOMES ARE POOR SO WE

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:58.554 region:rollup2
WANT.

01:15:55.785 --> 01:15:59.088 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND CAL WORKS BE ABLE

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.122 region:rollup2
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.657 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:03.359 region:rollup2
POSITIVE THINGS THAT THE STATE

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:05.027 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE ON TO

01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:06.529 region:rollup2
HELP LOWER WAGE WORKERS HAVE A

WOULD GET NEXT YEAR BASED ON THE

01:20:15.277 --> 01:20:19.214 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE SINGLE

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:20.449 region:rollup2

AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:45.341 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IS BECAUSE OF THE

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:48.677 region:rollup2
ECONOMIC EXPANSION. WITH A RAPID

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:49.345 region:rollup2
DECLINING CASELOAD AND WE HAVE A

LOT OF MONEY FOR. A FOR SERVICES

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.193 region:rollup2
MORE THAN WE COULD SPENT

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:05.994 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT WE DIDN'T SPEND.

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:08.097 region:rollup2
WE WOULD WE GAVE BACK.

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:09.698 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SIMPLY.

BUREAUCRACIES THAT RUN THESE.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:16.805 region:rollup2
HUGE PROGRAMS WERE NOT THAT

01:21:15.738 --> 01:21:18.574 region:rollup2
NIMBLE ARM AND THEN WE'VE HAD A

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:19.608 region:rollup2
RAPID ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHICH

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:21.744 region:rollup2
HAS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:23.445 region:rollup2
CASELOAD DECLINE AND WE SEE THE

01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:24.046 region:rollup2
SHIFT ON THE OTHER END THE

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:24.246 region:rollup2

THE SINGLE ALLOCATION BASED ON A

01:21:55.144 --> 01:21:57.746 region:rollup2
A CASELOAD REDUCTION.

01:21:55.978 --> 01:21:59.882 region:rollup2

DECADES OLD METHODOLOGY IS

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:33.562 region:rollup2
FLAWED.

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:34.863 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING

EACH HAVE A PROPOSAL TO. TALK

02:11:03.356 --> 02:11:06.058 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:11:03.556 --> 02:11:07.793 region:rollup2
.

02:11:06.058 --> 02:11:09.328 region:rollup2
THE FIRST ONE THAT I WILL

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:10.796 region:rollup2
DISCUSS IS THE.

02:11:09.328 --> 02:11:12.798 region:rollup2
IS THE TIME CLOCK.

02:11:10.796 --> 02:11:15.368 region:rollup2
FOR COWARDS.

02:11:12.798 --> 02:11:17.069 region:rollup2
AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE.

02:11:15.368 --> 02:11:20.339 region:rollup2
.

02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:22.441 region:rollup2
THAT FEDERAL CLOCK ALLOWS UNDER

02:11:20.339 --> 02:11:22.975 region:rollup2
CANNOT ALLOW US FOR. A RECIPIENT

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:24.176 region:rollup2
TO STAY ON EIGHT FOR SIXTY

02:11:22.975 --> 02:11:26.145 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

02:11:24.176 --> 02:11:27.012 region:rollup2
ALMOST SOME TWO THIRDS OF THE

02:11:26.145 --> 02:11:28.881 region:rollup2
STATES IN THE UNITED STATES

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:29.815 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IN FACT DO YOU HAVE A

02:11:28.881 --> 02:11:31.917 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN MONTH TIME CLOCK.

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:33.119 region:rollup2
.

02:11:31.917 --> 02:11:36.555 region:rollup2
WE A AND.

02:11:33.119 --> 02:11:38.324 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. IT TIME

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:39.992 region:rollup2
OF SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS

02:11:38.324 --> 02:11:41.594 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STATE.

02:11:39.992 --> 02:11:42.862 region:rollup2
MAYBE CHANGE THAT CLOCK AND WE

02:11:41.594 --> 02:11:45.264 region:rollup2
WENT TO.

02:11:42.862 --> 02:11:47.967 region:rollup2
WE MADE TWO CHANGES ACTUALLY WE

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:48.501 region:rollup2
WE WE STARTED THE SO CALLED

02:11:47.967 --> 02:11:50.069 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR MONTH FLEXIBLE

02:11:48.501 --> 02:11:51.771 region:rollup2
CLOCK.

02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:52.671 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWED RECIPIENTS APART

02:11:51.771 --> 02:11:54.240 region:rollup2
SPEIGHT IN A WIDE RANGE OF

02:11:52.671 --> 02:11:55.741 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

02:11:54.240 --> 02:11:57.543 region:rollup2
AND THEN AFTER THOSE TWENTY

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:58.978 region:rollup2
FOUR MONTHS WERE USED UP.

02:11:57.543 --> 02:12:00.379 region:rollup2
A FAMILIES CAN HAVE AN

02:11:58.978 --> 02:12:02.448 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR MONTHS ON

02:12:00.379 --> 02:12:03.983 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THAT WAS BASED ON THE

02:12:02.448 --> 02:12:05.117 region:rollup2
CANNIBALS.

02:12:03.983 --> 02:12:06.819 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S THOUGH WORLD THAT

02:12:05.117 --> 02:12:08.621 region:rollup2
WE'VE LIVED IN CENTS TWO

02:12:06.819 --> 02:12:09.488 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TWELVE. WE ONLY

02:12:08.621 --> 02:12:11.690 region:rollup2
HAVE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS ON

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:14.226 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:15.494 region:rollup2
FOR YOU FOR A. OF A PERCENTAGE

02:12:14.226 --> 02:12:18.164 region:rollup2
OF OUR FAMILIES A PORTION OF OUR

02:12:15.494 --> 02:12:20.399 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THIS THIS ACTUALLY AXES

02:12:18.164 --> 02:12:21.767 region:rollup2
OF SIGNIFICANT BARRIER. AND IT

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:23.469 region:rollup2
DOES SO I THINK IN TWO WAYS

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:24.804 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL FOR FAMILIES WHO

02:12:23.469 --> 02:12:26.505 region:rollup2
HAVE I THINK SIGNIFICANT

02:12:24.804 --> 02:12:27.573 region:rollup2
BARRIERS JUST TO BE ABLE TO

02:12:26.505 --> 02:12:29.375 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE ON

02:12:27.573 --> 02:12:30.743 region:rollup2
WELFARE TO WORK. PEOPLE WITH

02:12:29.375 --> 02:12:32.745 region:rollup2
LEARNING DISABILITIES PEOPLE WHO

02:12:30.743 --> 02:12:34.079 region:rollup2
MAY NOT WHOSE ENGLISH IS NOT

02:12:32.745 --> 02:12:35.748 region:rollup2
THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE.

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:37.216 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

02:12:35.748 --> 02:12:39.452 region:rollup2
ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE THEY

02:12:37.216 --> 02:12:40.653 region:rollup2
FREQUENTLY NEED MORE TIME JUST

02:12:39.452 --> 02:12:41.921 region:rollup2
LIKE WE SEE WITH PEOPLE HAVE

02:12:40.653 --> 02:12:43.422 region:rollup2
DISABILITIES WE HAVE AN

02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:44.824 region:rollup2
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.

02:12:43.422 --> 02:12:46.358 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE HAVE THAT

02:12:44.824 --> 02:12:47.726 region:rollup2
TIME THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:50.496 region:rollup2
GET THROUGH ACTIVITIES.

02:12:47.726 --> 02:12:51.864 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A OR A POPULATION

02:12:50.496 --> 02:12:53.599 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY COULD USE NOT ONLY

02:12:51.864 --> 02:12:54.967 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN MONTHS BUT PROBABLY

02:12:53.599 --> 02:12:57.069 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT IN SOME CASES

02:12:54.967 --> 02:12:59.171 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR. PARTICULAR

02:12:57.069 --> 02:13:00.339 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE.

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:02.208 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SECOND GROUP OF

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:03.976 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT WE SEE THAT ARE I

02:13:02.208 --> 02:13:05.177 region:rollup2
THINK IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY

02:13:03.976 --> 02:13:06.479 region:rollup2
THE LIMIT OF A FORTIETH MONTH

02:13:05.177 --> 02:13:07.513 region:rollup2
CLOCK.

02:13:06.479 --> 02:13:08.781 region:rollup2
OUR FAMILY SEWER AND EDUCATION

02:13:07.513 --> 02:13:10.850 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS

02:13:08.781 --> 02:13:12.818 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY

02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:13.953 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT. I GOT THROUGH COLLEGE

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:16.155 region:rollup2
IN FOUR YEARS.

02:13:13.953 --> 02:13:17.556 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT VERY COMMON ANYMORE

02:13:16.155 --> 02:13:19.191 region:rollup2
AND I THINK PARTICULARLY FOR

02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:20.826 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS WHO HAVE

02:13:19.191 --> 02:13:23.195 region:rollup2
OTHER WORK ACTIVITIES THAT THEY

02:13:20.826 --> 02:13:25.264 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MEET. ON THEIR PROGRESS

02:13:23.195 --> 02:13:25.898 region:rollup2
THROUGH TO A FOUR YEAR DEGREE OR

02:13:25.264 --> 02:13:28.133 region:rollup2
EVEN GETTING THROUGH A TWO YEAR

02:13:25.898 --> 02:13:29.702 region:rollup2
DEGREE. CAN FREQUENTLY TAKE

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:32.838 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS OR MORE.

02:13:29.702 --> 02:13:34.440 region:rollup2
I DO A LOT OF COWARDS TRAINING

02:13:32.838 --> 02:13:35.441 region:rollup2
THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.709 region:rollup2
COLLEGES LIKE AT THE MEET A LOT

02:13:35.441 --> 02:13:38.344 region:rollup2
OF RECIPIENTS.

02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:40.412 region:rollup2
ARM AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I

02:13:38.344 --> 02:13:43.048 region:rollup2
GET IT EVERY SESSION IS AYE MAK

02:13:40.412 --> 02:13:44.650 region:rollup2
MIKE I I HAVE I'M I'VE GOT A

02:13:43.048 --> 02:13:46.552 region:rollup2
NOTICE THAT MY FORTY EIGHT

02:13:44.650 --> 02:13:48.120 region:rollup2
MONTHS ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE. BUT

02:13:46.552 --> 02:13:50.389 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM THAT I MEAN THAT THE

02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:52.157 region:rollup2
COUNTY HAS PUT ME IN. WILL I'M

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:53.058 region:rollup2
WILL END AFTER MY FORTY EIGHT

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:55.027 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:56.829 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

02:13:55.027 --> 02:13:58.530 region:rollup2
AND I LITERALLY DON'T DON'T HAVE

02:13:56.829 --> 02:14:00.165 region:rollup2
AN ANSWER FOR THEM I HAVE NO

02:13:58.530 --> 02:14:01.767 region:rollup2
SUGGESTION FOR THAT.

02:14:00.165 --> 02:14:03.135 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLD AT THIS POINT ABOUT

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:04.870 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY SHOULD DO I THE ONLY

02:14:03.135 --> 02:14:06.539 region:rollup2
THING REALLY THEY CAN DO IS TRY

02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:08.107 region:rollup2
TO GET A LEGAL SERVICE ATTORNEY.

02:14:06.539 --> 02:14:09.975 region:rollup2
MAYBE GO BACK AND COUNT AND SEE

02:14:08.107 --> 02:14:11.310 region:rollup2
IF THAT COUNTY ACCURATELY COUNT

02:14:09.975 --> 02:14:13.178 region:rollup2
OF THE NUMBER OF MONTHS. BUT

02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:14.680 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT THERE'S NOTHING WE

02:14:13.178 --> 02:14:16.382 region:rollup2
CAN DO TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:19.451 region:rollup2
PERSON COMPLETES THAT PROGRAM.

02:14:16.382 --> 02:14:21.186 region:rollup2
SO FOR THESE REASONS AND I JUST

02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:23.622 region:rollup2
THINK ON THE GROUNDS OF BASIC

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:25.791 region:rollup2
EQUITY AND THE FACT THAT THE.

02:14:23.622 --> 02:14:27.593 region:rollup2
TO REMIND US ALL THAT THE

02:14:25.791 --> 02:14:31.130 region:rollup2
DECISION TO GO TO A SIXTEEN

02:14:27.593 --> 02:14:34.099 region:rollup2
MONTH CLOCK. WAS DONE.

02:14:31.130 --> 02:14:36.635 region:rollup2
AS WE ELIMINATED A LIFE THERE

02:14:34.099 --> 02:14:38.437 region:rollup2
WITH THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS OVER

02:14:36.635 --> 02:14:40.139 region:rollup2
A PERSON'S TIME ON AID THE

02:14:38.437 --> 02:14:41.740 region:rollup2
ENTIRE TIME THEY'RE ON A WE YOU

02:14:40.139 --> 02:14:44.476 region:rollup2
SO NOT HAVE ANY TIME LIMIT AT

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:46.245 region:rollup2
ALL. SO FOR US TO GO FROM THAT

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:48.647 region:rollup2
A SIXTY MONTHS DOWN TO FORTY

02:14:46.245 --> 02:14:50.115 region:rollup2

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:52.718 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE

02:14:53.886 --> 02:14:57.756 region:rollup2
COWARDS.

02:15:59.284 --> 02:16:04.156 region:rollup2
AGAINST PARTY TIME AS A REGULAR

02:16:02.121 --> 02:16:05.290 region:rollup2
PERSON GOING TO COLLEGE.

02:16:04.156 --> 02:16:07.026 region:rollup2
SHE ALSO GETS THIRTY TIME AS THE

02:16:05.290 --> 02:16:08.494 region:rollup2
SIP.

02:16:07.026 --> 02:16:09.862 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY

02:16:08.494 --> 02:16:11.664 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO

02:16:09.862 --> 02:16:14.066 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THINKING.

02:16:11.664 --> 02:16:17.636 region:rollup2
LIKE I THINK FOR THE DIRECTOR

02:16:14.066 --> 02:16:18.737 region:rollup2
ATARI.

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:19.805 region:rollup2
I USUALLY DIRECTOR BY MY MEMORY

02:16:18.737 --> 02:16:20.472 region:rollup2
DOESN'T GO BACK FAR ENOUGH TO

02:16:19.805 --> 02:16:22.541 region:rollup2
TELL WHETHER THAT WAS A

02:16:20.472 --> 02:16:23.475 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ERROR OR WHAT HAPPENED

02:16:22.541 --> 02:16:25.811 region:rollup2
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S AND.

02:16:23.475 --> 02:16:27.713 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENCY.

02:16:25.811 --> 02:16:29.682 region:rollup2
NO OBJECTION TO THAT

02:16:27.713 --> 02:16:31.350 region:rollup2
THE THE ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE

02:16:29.682 --> 02:16:31.984 region:rollup2
A PURPOSE TO HAROLD'S. COMMENTS

02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:33.252 region:rollup2
ON THE SIXTY VERSUS FORTY EIGHT

02:16:31.984 --> 02:16:35.020 region:rollup2
MONTHLY.

02:16:33.252 --> 02:16:36.755 region:rollup2
IS THE IT'S A TIME LIMIT IN

02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:38.424 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ON ADULTS

02:16:36.755 --> 02:16:39.725 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ON. CHILDREN CHILDREN

02:16:38.424 --> 02:16:41.660 region:rollup2
REMAIN ELIGIBLE UNTIL THEY TURN

02:16:39.725 --> 02:16:43.962 region:rollup2

BUT I MEAN THAT'S NOT TO.

02:16:49.468 --> 02:16:53.772 region:rollup2
ARGUE.

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:55.641 region:rollup2

WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY

02:17:09.354 --> 02:17:12.424 region:rollup2

POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IS

THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST

02:22:47.526 --> 02:22:50.862 region:rollup2
YEAR MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM

HAVE TO STAFF INCLUDED.

02:22:50.862 --> 02:22:53.865 region:rollup2

02:22:59.104 --> 02:23:01.673 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE.

02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:03.742 region:rollup2
TO GO AWAY TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:23:01.673 --> 02:23:05.677 region:rollup2
THAT WILL MAINTAIN BALLPARK

02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.279 region:rollup2
STRONG PROGRAM INTEGRITY

02:23:05.677 --> 02:23:08.580 region:rollup2
STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE.

02:23:07.279 --> 02:23:09.981 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME ALSO

02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:11.650 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DELIVER.

02:23:09.981 --> 02:23:13.085 region:rollup2
ON THE PROMISE OF GETTING

02:23:11.650 --> 02:23:14.686 region:rollup2
WELFARE BENEFITS IMPROVE MORE

02:23:13.085 --> 02:23:16.288 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY AND

02:23:14.686 --> 02:23:18.757 region:rollup2
ACCURATELY OVERTIME.

02:23:16.288 --> 02:23:20.992 region:rollup2
SO JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

02:23:18.757 --> 02:23:22.027 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS WE GO FOR IT I AS WE

02:23:20.992 --> 02:23:23.295 region:rollup2
GO INTO THAT PROCESS I WANTED TO

02:23:22.027 --> 02:23:25.263 region:rollup2
KNOW.

02:23:23.295 --> 02:23:26.498 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:23:25.263 --> 02:23:29.968 region:rollup2
WERE REALLY STRIVING FOR IN THIS

02:23:26.498 --> 02:23:32.003 region:rollup2
PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:23:29.968 --> 02:23:33.538 region:rollup2
PROGRAM'S REALLY. ON TREAT

02:23:32.003 --> 02:23:35.173 region:rollup2
EVERYONE THE SAME.

02:23:33.538 --> 02:23:37.442 region:rollup2
WEEK I THINK IN THE PAST IT

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:39.778 region:rollup2
WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT AND

02:23:37.442 --> 02:23:40.979 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD MR AMERICAN OTHER OF

02:23:39.778 --> 02:23:42.747 region:rollup2
VENUES MAKE THE FOLLOWING

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:44.716 region:rollup2
COMMENT. THAT IT'S NO ACCIDENT

02:23:42.747 --> 02:23:46.918 region:rollup2
THAT MEDI CAL HAS SOMEWHAT FEWER

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:49.054 region:rollup2
RULES THEN THE SNAP PROGRAM THAT

02:23:46.918 --> 02:23:50.222 region:rollup2
WE KNOW IT'S CAL FRESH. AND THAT

02:23:49.054 --> 02:23:52.691 region:rollup2
THE WILL POWER TO PROGRAM THE

02:23:50.222 --> 02:23:55.193 region:rollup2
TANF PROGRAM HAS MANY MORE RULES

02:23:52.691 --> 02:23:57.262 region:rollup2
THAN THE THAN THE SNAP PROGRAM

02:23:55.193 --> 02:23:58.396 region:rollup2
MORE THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS.

02:23:57.262 --> 02:24:01.433 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE.

02:23:58.396 --> 02:24:02.501 region:rollup2
OF SORT OF A BIAS THAT HAS.

02:24:01.433 --> 02:24:04.369 region:rollup2
WE CREATED OVER TIME TOWARDS

02:24:02.501 --> 02:24:06.805 region:rollup2
CASH ASSIST.

02:24:04.369 --> 02:24:08.440 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT BIAS IS I

02:24:06.805 --> 02:24:10.542 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:11.877 region:rollup2
A LEGACY THAT WE ALL LIVE WITH

02:24:10.542 --> 02:24:14.212 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY ALL

02:24:11.877 --> 02:24:15.247 region:rollup2
OVER THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK

02:24:14.212 --> 02:24:17.082 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

02:24:15.247 --> 02:24:18.350 region:rollup2
WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE GO

02:24:17.082 --> 02:24:20.051 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND MAKING

02:24:18.350 --> 02:24:21.720 region:rollup2
THOSE DETERMINATIONS. IS TO MAKE

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:23.455 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE REALLY IS NO BIAS

02:24:21.720 --> 02:24:24.990 region:rollup2
THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT CAST.

02:24:23.455 --> 02:24:27.759 region:rollup2
ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN WE LOOK AT

02:24:24.990 --> 02:24:29.828 region:rollup2
SNAP BENEFIT FROM EBT CARD OR A

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:30.829 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL CARD LIKE THEY ARE ALL

02:24:29.828 --> 02:24:32.497 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE

02:24:30.829 --> 02:24:33.832 region:rollup2
SAME. IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND THE

02:24:32.497 --> 02:24:36.034 region:rollup2
SHALL BE TREATED THE SAME WAY BY

02:24:33.832 --> 02:24:37.068 region:rollup2
CLIENTS AND SO THAT I THINK ONE

02:24:36.034 --> 02:24:38.803 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:24:37.068 --> 02:24:40.705 region:rollup2
FOR IS THE HAVE REALLY SIMILAR

02:24:38.803 --> 02:24:42.707 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AROUND PROGRAM

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:44.042 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY THAT WOULD APPLY

02:24:42.707 --> 02:24:45.777 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:24:44.042 --> 02:24:47.245 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FOR US THE AYE WE'VE

02:24:45.777 --> 02:24:49.514 region:rollup2
HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS

02:24:47.245 --> 02:24:52.317 region:rollup2
IDEA THAT THE DEPARTMENT. MAY

02:24:49.514 --> 02:24:54.452 region:rollup2
NOW IN THE ABSENCE OF KBA GO

02:24:52.317 --> 02:24:55.687 region:rollup2
BACK TO REQUIRING APPLICANTS TO

02:24:54.452 --> 02:24:57.389 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COME TO THE WELFARE

02:24:55.687 --> 02:24:57.956 region:rollup2
OFFICE CAO WORKS APPLICANTS TO

02:24:57.389 --> 02:24:58.557 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COME TO THE WELFARE

02:24:57.956 --> 02:25:00.525 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

02:24:58.557 --> 02:25:02.561 region:rollup2
TO PROVE THEIR IDENTITY NOW A

02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:03.828 region:rollup2
FEW YEARS AGO WESTERN CENTER WAS

02:25:02.561 --> 02:25:05.497 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:07.432 region:rollup2
S. B. NINE FORTY FIVE BY SENATOR

02:25:05.497 --> 02:25:09.234 region:rollup2
PAN. THAT ACTUALLY CREATES A

02:25:07.432 --> 02:25:10.268 region:rollup2
PATH FOR.

02:25:09.234 --> 02:25:12.904 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TO BE.

02:25:10.268 --> 02:25:14.906 region:rollup2
ONLINE APPLICATION AND FOR TO

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:16.174 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY TO GET ELIMINATE THE

02:25:14.906 --> 02:25:17.576 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT THERE BE FACE TO

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:19.644 region:rollup2
FACE INTERVIEWS.

02:25:17.576 --> 02:25:21.479 region:rollup2
SO THAT PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE

02:25:19.644 --> 02:25:23.181 region:rollup2
HEARING ABOUT THIS.

02:25:21.479 --> 02:25:25.016 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL DRAFT ACL.

02:25:23.181 --> 02:25:26.918 region:rollup2
WOULD SEEM TO.

02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:29.054 region:rollup2
BE INCONSISTENT WITH S. B. NINE

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:31.623 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN AND WE WOULD BE

02:25:29.054 --> 02:25:34.292 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT IF THE RESPONSE

02:25:31.623 --> 02:25:36.027 region:rollup2
STILL LIMITING KBA WAS TO CREATE

02:25:34.292 --> 02:25:37.395 region:rollup2
ANOTHER STEP FOR RECIPIENTS TO

02:25:36.027 --> 02:25:39.097 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

02:25:37.395 --> 02:25:40.098 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY'LL BE A

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:41.733 region:rollup2
MEETING OF THE MINDS BETWEEN THE

02:25:40.098 --> 02:25:43.368 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:25:41.733 --> 02:25:46.838 region:rollup2
THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO FIND AN

02:25:43.368 --> 02:25:49.174 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT DOESN'T.

02:25:46.838 --> 02:25:51.209 region:rollup2
ASSIST APPEAR TO REOPEN THAT

02:25:49.174 --> 02:25:52.677 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION DISCUSSION AROUND S.

02:25:51.209 --> 02:25:54.913 region:rollup2
B. NINE FORTY SEVEN IF I COULD

02:25:52.677 --> 02:25:56.548 region:rollup2
CLARIFY. FOR THE COMMITTEE S. B.

02:25:54.913 --> 02:25:58.016 region:rollup2
NINE FORTY SEVEN WAVED THE

02:25:56.548 --> 02:26:00.151 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR FACE TO FACE

02:25:58.016 --> 02:26:01.586 region:rollup2
INTERVIEW IT DID NOT ELIMINATE

02:26:00.151 --> 02:26:02.887 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE.

02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:03.922 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION ESTABLISHING

02:26:02.887 --> 02:26:07.025 region:rollup2
IDENTITY

02:26:03.922 --> 02:26:08.526 region:rollup2
THIS THE THE DIFFERENCE AND.

02:26:07.025 --> 02:26:10.262 region:rollup2
WHEN AS WE REFER TO CASH RATHER

02:26:08.526 --> 02:26:11.296 region:rollup2
THAN THE OTHER BENEFITS

02:26:10.262 --> 02:26:12.964 region:rollup2
IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THINKING

02:26:11.296 --> 02:26:16.401 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:26:12.964 --> 02:26:18.536 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO SEEK THE BENEFIT.

02:26:16.401 --> 02:26:19.504 region:rollup2
ARE IN ANY WAY. LESS GOOD LESS

02:26:18.536 --> 02:26:22.240 region:rollup2
WORTHY.

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:23.475 region:rollup2
IT IS THAT.

02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.343 region:rollup2
THE SNAP BENEFIT AND THE

02:26:23.475 --> 02:26:27.078 region:rollup2
MEDICAID BENEFIT.

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:28.246 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO CASH

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:29.914 region:rollup2
EXCEPT ACTUALLY BUT THE MEDICAL

02:26:28.246 --> 02:26:31.416 region:rollup2
PROFESSION IN ONE INSTANCE OF

02:26:29.914 --> 02:26:32.117 region:rollup2
RETAILERS ON THE OTHER AND IN

02:26:31.416 --> 02:26:33.585 region:rollup2
BOTH CASES THAT LEGAL BRIGHT

02:26:32.117 --> 02:26:36.888 region:rollup2
TRAIL BEHIND.

02:26:33.585 --> 02:26:39.791 region:rollup2
AND WE IN THE OIG AND D. H. CS

02:26:36.888 --> 02:26:42.560 region:rollup2
MEDICAID FRAUD GOAL AFTER.

02:26:39.791 --> 02:26:45.096 region:rollup2
THE CASH PROGRAM IS A TARGET FOR

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.399 region:rollup2
THE SOPHISTICATED.

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:49.701 region:rollup2
CYBER CRIMINALS WEEK WEEK WE

02:26:47.399 --> 02:26:51.670 region:rollup2
HAVE. CURRENTLY EXPERIENCES

02:26:49.701 --> 02:26:53.738 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE HAVING OUR CLIENTS

02:26:51.670 --> 02:26:54.906 region:rollup2
BESIEGED ONLINE BY VERY

02:26:53.738 --> 02:26:57.909 region:rollup2
SOPHISTICATED SCAMS

02:26:54.906 --> 02:27:00.211 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO.

02:26:57.909 --> 02:27:02.614 region:rollup2
IN ANY WAY IMPLY THAT IT IS THE

02:27:00.211 --> 02:27:04.115 region:rollup2
POOR PERSON SEEKING BENEFITS.

02:27:02.614 --> 02:27:06.017 region:rollup2
AGAINST WHOM WE ARE PROTECTING

02:27:04.115 --> 02:27:07.919 region:rollup2
THE CASH PROGRAM CALIFORNIA HAS

02:27:06.017 --> 02:27:08.586 region:rollup2
A THIRD.

02:27:07.919 --> 02:27:09.988 region:rollup2
THIRD OF THE WHOLE CASH PROGRAM

02:27:08.586 --> 02:27:11.156 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRIES IN CALIFORNIA

02:27:09.988 --> 02:27:12.624 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORTED WE BELIEVE WE'VE

02:27:11.156 --> 02:27:14.092 region:rollup2
DEFENDED.

02:27:12.624 --> 02:27:15.527 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO DEFEND ITS

02:27:14.092 --> 02:27:17.929 region:rollup2
INTEGRITY UP TO THIS POINT I'VE

02:27:15.527 --> 02:27:20.532 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO SAY WHENEVER ASKED.

SAY YES I. DO I HAVE NO QUALMS

02:27:25.336 --> 02:27:28.440 region:rollup2
IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE PRESERVE

02:27:27.072 --> 02:27:30.809 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO GO ON SAYING THAT

02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:32.477 region:rollup2

TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION AND

02:27:38.783 --> 02:27:41.419 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE THE

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:45.390 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION GOING

02:27:41.419 --> 02:27:45.690 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

02:27:45.390 --> 02:27:47.225 region:rollup2
CAROL SURE.

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:49.694 region:rollup2
.

02:27:47.225 --> 02:27:51.162 region:rollup2
A YEAH WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH MR

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:52.197 region:rollup2
LIKE PORN AYE AYE THAT'S THE

02:27:51.162 --> 02:27:52.797 region:rollup2
CASE AND EFFECT I THINK THE

02:27:52.197 --> 02:27:54.199 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES AN

02:27:52.797 --> 02:27:55.100 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT JOB. APPOINTEE NOW

02:27:54.199 --> 02:27:57.168 region:rollup2
WITH THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS

02:27:55.100 --> 02:27:58.903 region:rollup2
ARE FOR PROVIDING IDENTIFICATION

02:27:57.168 --> 02:28:00.872 region:rollup2
I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT RIGHT

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:02.607 region:rollup2
NOW. ALL VIRTUALLY EVERY

02:28:00.872 --> 02:28:03.875 region:rollup2
APPLICANT FOR TOWER STILL DOES

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:04.943 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO TO THE WELFARE OFFICE

02:28:03.875 --> 02:28:06.478 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:28:04.943 --> 02:28:07.779 region:rollup2
PRODUCE IDENTIFICATION THEY'RE

02:28:06.478 --> 02:28:08.446 region:rollup2
GOING AFTER PRES.

02:28:07.779 --> 02:28:09.681 region:rollup2
UP.

02:28:08.446 --> 02:28:11.449 region:rollup2
A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR THEIR

02:28:09.681 --> 02:28:13.084 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT AND WE

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:14.419 region:rollup2
DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE WHAT'S

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:15.987 region:rollup2
ROTH PROGRAM INTEGRITY STANDARDS

02:28:14.419 --> 02:28:17.756 region:rollup2
AND EFFECT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:28:15.987 --> 02:28:18.757 region:rollup2
THE PROOF WITHIN THE EVIDENCE

02:28:17.756 --> 02:28:19.791 region:rollup2
THAT THE SEAT THIS PROGRAM

02:28:18.757 --> 02:28:21.326 region:rollup2
REALLY DIDN'T PRODUCE ANY

02:28:19.791 --> 02:28:22.060 region:rollup2
DUPLICATE AID FRAUD.

02:28:21.326 --> 02:28:23.561 region:rollup2
THE NOT THE NUMBERS ARE

02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:25.029 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY LOW THAT IT ACTUALLY

02:28:23.561 --> 02:28:26.931 region:rollup2
PRODUCED AND I THINK THAT IS

02:28:25.029 --> 02:28:28.433 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT

02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:29.968 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FEATURES THAT ARE BUILT

02:28:28.433 --> 02:28:30.502 region:rollup2
IN AROUND THE FILE CLEARANCE

02:28:29.968 --> 02:28:31.603 region:rollup2
THAT ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR

02:28:30.502 --> 02:28:31.970 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS.

02:28:31.603 --> 02:28:34.839 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

02:28:31.970 --> 02:28:36.341 region:rollup2
.

02:28:34.839 --> 02:28:36.841 region:rollup2
NO NO OFFENSE INTENDED TO THE

02:28:36.341 --> 02:28:38.910 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

02:28:36.841 --> 02:28:40.378 region:rollup2
I AS I NOTED I THINK MUCH OF

02:28:38.910 --> 02:28:41.746 region:rollup2
WHAT WE OUR LIVING WITH HERE IS

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:43.948 region:rollup2
A LEGACY ISSUE.

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:45.583 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE WOULD

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:47.752 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT WE SUPPORT THE

02:28:45.583 --> 02:28:48.920 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION THAT

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:50.955 region:rollup2
WE ADOPT THE FILE CLEARANCE

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:52.524 region:rollup2
PROCESS AS PART OF THE STATUTE

02:28:50.955 --> 02:28:54.259 region:rollup2
SO THAT IT THE BONNET WE CLEAR.

02:28:52.524 --> 02:28:55.360 region:rollup2
TO PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE AS WELL

02:28:54.259 --> 02:28:56.995 region:rollup2
NOTES THAT WE HAVE STRONG

02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:58.763 region:rollup2
PROGRAM INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

02:28:56.995 --> 02:29:00.064 region:rollup2
IN THAT WHERE WE'RE BEING VERY

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:01.866 region:rollup2
CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY WERE

02:29:00.064 --> 02:29:03.168 region:rollup2
SPENDING THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. AND

02:29:01.866 --> 02:29:03.635 region:rollup2
THEN LASTLY I THINK WE WOULD

02:29:03.168 --> 02:29:06.604 region:rollup2
ALSO DOORS.

02:29:03.635 --> 02:29:07.772 region:rollup2

02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:09.207 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE

02:29:07.772 --> 02:29:10.775 region:rollup2
THAT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAYS

02:29:09.207 --> 02:29:12.110 region:rollup2
THAT THE MEDS PROGRAM CAN BE

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:14.012 region:rollup2
ENHANCED AND MADE BETTER.

02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:15.180 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST

02:29:14.012 --> 02:29:17.816 region:rollup2
NOTE THAT IS.

02:29:15.180 --> 02:29:19.818 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS THIS HUB.

02:29:17.816 --> 02:29:20.885 region:rollup2
PROJECT ONLINE I DO THINK THAT

02:29:19.818 --> 02:29:22.587 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL

02:29:20.885 --> 02:29:24.389 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVOCATES

02:29:22.587 --> 02:29:26.658 region:rollup2
AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

REGARDING KBA IN OUR CONCERNS I

02:29:48.680 --> 02:29:52.383 region:rollup2
THINK FOR THOSE SAME REASONS WE

02:29:50.215 --> 02:29:53.785 region:rollup2
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MOVE

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:56.221 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL TO RELEASE AND ALL

02:29:53.785 --> 02:29:57.589 region:rollup2
COUNTY LETTER. AND WE ARE SEEING

02:29:56.221 --> 02:30:00.158 region:rollup2
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT IS

02:29:57.589 --> 02:30:01.125 region:rollup2
SEEKING TO PENALIZE IMMIGRANTS

02:30:00.158 --> 02:30:02.260 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR USE OF CRITICAL

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:04.529 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:06.164 region:rollup2
AND THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY

02:30:04.529 --> 02:30:07.665 region:rollup2
BEEN IN THE PAST IN THE MEDIA

02:30:06.164 --> 02:30:09.234 region:rollup2
AND IS ALREADY HAVING AN IMPACT

02:30:07.665 --> 02:30:10.401 region:rollup2
ON INDIVIDUALS WERE ASKING TO

02:30:09.234 --> 02:30:12.237 region:rollup2
DESCEND ROLE AND SO WE WOULD

02:30:10.401 --> 02:30:14.005 region:rollup2
JUST ASK THAT WE TAKE. CAREFUL

02:30:12.237 --> 02:30:16.207 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION OF ANY NEW

02:30:14.005 --> 02:30:17.408 region:rollup2
BARRIERS OR ANY NEW HURDLES AND

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:18.743 region:rollup2
REALLY THINK ABOUT THE SPEED OF

02:30:17.408 --> 02:30:20.912 region:rollup2
WHICH WE ARE MOVING IN WITH

02:30:18.743 --> 02:30:22.347 region:rollup2
THESE PROPOSALS. AND BECAUSE OF

02:30:20.912 --> 02:30:24.849 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

02:30:22.347 --> 02:30:26.217 region:rollup2

WHOSE PARENTS ARE.

02:30:29.821 --> 02:30:32.390 region:rollup2
DO NOT HAVE IMMIGRATION STATUS

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:35.460 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD BE VERY

02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:37.028 region:rollup2
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF

02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:38.963 region:rollup2
CHANGE THIS QUICK CHANGE WOULD

02:30:37.028 --> 02:30:39.597 region:rollup2
HAVE AN EFFECT ON THOSE

02:30:38.963 --> 02:30:40.965 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE SEEKING

02:30:39.597 --> 02:30:42.700 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE. AND FOR THOSE

02:30:40.965 --> 02:30:45.370 region:rollup2
REASONS WE SUPPORT THE STAFF

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:46.604 region:rollup2

PROBLEMS WITH THE CAL SHAPE

02:31:24.008 --> 02:31:28.012 region:rollup2

VEGETABLE EBT PILOT AGAIN WITH

03:02:54.597 --> 03:02:56.165 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES

03:02:55.565 --> 03:02:56.699 region:rollup2
SO AS EVERYONE HAS MADE CLEAR

03:02:56.165 --> 03:02:57.133 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT OF HUNGER IN

03:02:56.699 --> 03:02:58.868 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY

03:02:57.133 --> 03:03:00.736 region:rollup2
UNACCEPTABLE. AND THE FEDERAL

03:02:58.868 --> 03:03:02.238 region:rollup2
COFFERS BENEFIT WHAT WHO BENEFIT

03:03:00.736 --> 03:03:03.172 region:rollup2
IS INADEQUATE TO LAST THE MONTH.

03:03:02.238 --> 03:03:04.874 region:rollup2
I AM IN ONE PARTICULARLY CRUEL

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:06.442 region:rollup2
IRONY HERE IS THE ON

03:03:04.874 --> 03:03:08.044 region:rollup2
AFFORDABILITY OF FRESH FRUITS

03:03:06.442 --> 03:03:09.846 region:rollup2
AND VEGETABLES IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:08.044 --> 03:03:10.646 region:rollup2
FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE

03:03:09.846 --> 03:03:12.215 region:rollup2
PRODUCE MORE FRUITS AND

03:03:10.646 --> 03:03:13.649 region:rollup2
VEGETABLES THAN ANY STATE IN THE

03:03:12.215 --> 03:03:15.051 region:rollup2
NATION YET CLOSE TO FORTY

03:03:13.649 --> 03:03:16.452 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

03:03:15.051 --> 03:03:17.687 region:rollup2
CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ENOUGH TO EAT

03:03:16.452 --> 03:03:19.322 region:rollup2
PERIOD.

03:03:17.687 --> 03:03:20.857 region:rollup2
I'M IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HAD

03:03:19.322 --> 03:03:22.525 region:rollup2
WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

03:03:20.857 --> 03:03:23.993 region:rollup2
US AUTHORIZE CALIFORNIA LAW TO

03:03:22.525 --> 03:03:25.628 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THE HEALTHY FOOD

03:03:23.993 --> 03:03:26.929 region:rollup2
PURCHASE PILOTS. THAT WOULD

03:03:25.628 --> 03:03:28.564 region:rollup2
CREATE A SCALABLE FRESH FRUIT

03:03:26.929 --> 03:03:30.266 region:rollup2
AND VEGETABLE PURCHASE PROGRAM

03:03:28.564 --> 03:03:31.567 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED ON EBT.

03:03:30.266 --> 03:03:33.469 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WAS AUTHORIZING

03:03:31.567 --> 03:03:34.070 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LAW IT WAS CONTINGENT

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:35.204 region:rollup2
UPON THE RECEIPT OF A FEDERAL

03:03:34.070 --> 03:03:36.472 region:rollup2
GRANTS

03:03:35.204 --> 03:03:37.807 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THAT GRANT BECAME MADE

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:39.508 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY

03:03:37.807 --> 03:03:40.476 region:rollup2
MASSACHUSETTS WITH THE LUCKY

03:03:39.508 --> 03:03:41.878 region:rollup2
RECIPIENT OF A GRAND STATE OF

03:03:40.476 --> 03:03:43.746 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

03:03:41.878 --> 03:03:45.381 region:rollup2
BUT WHILE AT THAT TIME OUR

03:03:43.746 --> 03:03:46.949 region:rollup2
LOSSES MASSACHUSETTS GAIN AT

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:48.117 region:rollup2
THIS POINT WE NOW HAVE SEVEN

03:03:46.949 --> 03:03:48.985 region:rollup2
YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN

03:03:48.117 --> 03:03:50.686 region:rollup2
LOOK TO IN THE STATE OF

03:03:48.985 --> 03:03:51.821 region:rollup2
MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THEY STARTED

03:03:50.686 --> 03:03:54.023 region:rollup2
WITH THE PILOT AND NOW HAVE A

03:03:51.821 --> 03:03:55.424 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE EBT INTEGRATED.

03:03:54.023 --> 03:03:57.293 region:rollup2
HEALTHY INCENTIVE PURCHASE

03:03:55.424 --> 03:03:58.694 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND SO RATHER THAN

03:03:57.293 --> 03:04:00.363 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DESIGN EBT PROGRAMMING

03:03:58.694 --> 03:04:02.331 region:rollup2
FROM SCRATCH WE CAN MODEL UPON

03:04:00.363 --> 03:04:03.733 region:rollup2
THEIR EXPERIENCE AND PROVIDE A

03:04:02.331 --> 03:04:04.901 region:rollup2
DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH FOR THE

03:04:03.733 --> 03:04:06.068 region:rollup2
PURCHASE OF CALIFORNIA FRUITS

03:04:04.901 --> 03:04:07.870 region:rollup2
AND VEGETABLES THAT WILL ALLOW

03:04:06.068 --> 03:04:09.105 region:rollup2
CALTRAIN SHOPPERS TO STRETCH THE

03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:10.540 region:rollup2
BUDGET THROUGHOUT THE MONTH.

03:04:09.105 --> 03:04:12.208 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT SORT

03:04:10.540 --> 03:04:14.010 region:rollup2
OF STATEWIDE EBT INTEGRATED

03:04:12.208 --> 03:04:15.912 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LOTS OF LOCAL WELL LEFT

03:04:14.010 --> 03:04:16.479 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS HAVE SPRUNG UP IN

03:04:15.912 --> 03:04:18.080 region:rollup2
FARMERS MARKETS AND SOMEONE

03:04:16.479 --> 03:04:19.849 region:rollup2
GROCERY STORES BUT THEY ALL USE

03:04:18.080 --> 03:04:21.083 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN DIFFERENT COUPONS AND

03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:22.752 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS AND NAMES. AND

03:04:21.083 --> 03:04:24.954 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS.

03:04:22.752 --> 03:04:26.489 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS HAVE

03:04:24.954 --> 03:04:28.090 region:rollup2
IN SOME WAY ALMOST TAKING US

03:04:26.489 --> 03:04:29.825 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE USE OF FOOD STAMPS

03:04:28.090 --> 03:04:31.227 region:rollup2
I'M MORE USING VOUCHERS AND WE

03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:32.428 region:rollup2
ARE BURKE PUTTING THOSE

03:04:31.227 --> 03:04:34.196 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BURDENS

03:04:32.428 --> 03:04:35.431 region:rollup2
ON THE LOCALS TO ACTUALLY

03:04:34.196 --> 03:04:36.699 region:rollup2
PROCESS INTO ACCOUNTING WHEN

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:38.668 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE DOING OUTREACH IN

03:04:36.699 --> 03:04:40.703 region:rollup2
PROMOTION AND ALL. THE THINGS

03:04:38.668 --> 03:04:41.671 region:rollup2
THAT LOCUSTS DO BEST.

03:04:40.703 --> 03:04:42.672 region:rollup2
AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA NOTED THE

03:04:41.671 --> 03:04:44.340 region:rollup2
BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AREA ARE

03:04:42.672 --> 03:04:46.142 region:rollup2
AMONG THE TOP FROM OF HUNGER IN

03:04:44.340 --> 03:04:48.110 region:rollup2
THE NATION AND AND AT THE SAME

03:04:46.142 --> 03:04:49.879 region:rollup2
TIME IN THE AGAIN THE IRONY KERN

03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:51.013 region:rollup2
COUNTY IS NOW THE TOP PRODUCING

03:04:49.879 --> 03:04:52.181 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL COUNTY IN THE

03:04:51.013 --> 03:04:53.816 region:rollup2
NATION WITH FRESNO INTO ARE

03:04:52.181 --> 03:04:54.650 region:rollup2
CLOSE BEHIND.

03:04:53.816 --> 03:04:57.053 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE AGRICULTURE ABUNDANT

03:04:54.650 --> 03:04:58.187 region:rollup2
SIDE BY SIDE WITH EXTREME HUNGER

03:04:57.053 --> 03:04:59.555 region:rollup2
AND POVERTY I'M AND WE'RE NOT

03:04:58.187 --> 03:05:00.690 region:rollup2
CONNECTING THE TWO. AND

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:02.325 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THAT

03:05:00.690 --> 03:05:03.960 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS

03:05:02.325 --> 03:05:05.361 region:rollup2
ARE RELIANT ON VOUCHERS AND

03:05:03.960 --> 03:05:07.263 region:rollup2
LOCAL PHILANTHROPY KERN COUNTY

03:05:05.361 --> 03:05:08.564 region:rollup2

INTEGRATING ON EBT WE CAN HAVE A

03:05:11.534 --> 03:05:14.971 region:rollup2
MORE EQUITABLE APPROACH TO REACH

03:05:12.802 --> 03:05:16.806 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE STATE. AND LINK

BUDGET REPRESSED BECAUSE WE KNOW

03:05:39.428 --> 03:05:42.031 region:rollup2
IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

03:05:40.262 --> 03:05:42.631 region:rollup2
AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE RUN

03:05:42.031 --> 03:05:44.367 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM CALLED DOUBLE UP THE

03:05:42.631 --> 03:05:45.234 region:rollup2

03:53:49.148 --> 03:53:53.953 region:rollup2
.

03:53:51.251 --> 03:53:55.922 region:rollup2
ALL BALK ALL CONCLUDE BY BY BY

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:57.857 region:rollup2
SHARING SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

03:53:55.922 --> 03:54:00.760 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF

03:53:57.857 --> 03:54:02.962 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM SO. I THINK THAT THE

03:54:00.760 --> 03:54:04.931 region:rollup2
HEADLINES OF THE LAST WEEK ALONE

03:54:02.962 --> 03:54:06.900 region:rollup2
ARE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MAIN

03:54:04.931 --> 03:54:08.768 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF THE PROGRAM

03:54:06.900 --> 03:54:10.570 region:rollup2
THERE'S A. PRONOUNCEMENT ON

03:54:08.768 --> 03:54:12.438 region:rollup2
FEDERAL LAW AND POLICY IT SEEMS

03:54:10.570 --> 03:54:15.174 region:rollup2
LIKE EVERY DAY SOMETIMES TWICE A

03:54:12.438 --> 03:54:17.043 region:rollup2
DAY. AND THAT CREATES A STRAIN

03:54:15.174 --> 03:54:19.345 region:rollup2
ON THE ON THE SERVICE PROVIDERS

03:54:17.043 --> 03:54:21.948 region:rollup2
WHO ARE ON THE GROUND AND TRIED

03:54:19.345 --> 03:54:24.183 region:rollup2
TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OF THE OF

03:54:21.948 --> 03:54:27.220 region:rollup2
THE. THAT THE NEW POLICY

03:54:24.183 --> 03:54:29.022 region:rollup2
PRONOUNCEMENTS CREATE. AND ALSO.

03:54:27.220 --> 03:54:31.124 region:rollup2
.

03:54:29.022 --> 03:54:33.593 region:rollup2
IT ALSO GENERATES

03:54:31.124 --> 03:54:35.295 region:rollup2
I'VE ALONG LIST OF PRIORITIES

03:54:33.593 --> 03:54:37.030 region:rollup2
AND IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT

03:54:35.295 --> 03:54:38.731 region:rollup2
TO CHOOSE AMONGST THOSE

03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:41.267 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES WHETHER IT'S TPS

03:54:38.731 --> 03:54:44.370 region:rollup2
HOLDERS OR DHAKA OR ASYLUM

03:54:41.267 --> 03:54:45.738 region:rollup2
SEEKERS OR CHILDREN OR THE API

03:54:44.370 --> 03:54:47.941 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ALL

03:54:45.738 --> 03:54:50.410 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY COMPELLING

03:54:47.941 --> 03:54:52.378 region:rollup2
DEMANDS AND THERE'S THERE'S A

03:54:50.410 --> 03:54:54.781 region:rollup2
LOT MORE NEED. THAN CAN

03:54:52.378 --> 03:54:56.683 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY BE MATT EITHER WITH

03:54:54.781 --> 03:54:58.418 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING LEVELS OR FRANKLY

WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

03:54:58.418 --> 03:55:03.222 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE AND I THINK THE.

03:55:00.153 --> 03:55:05.058 region:rollup2
THE THE PROGRAM RUNS INTO THE

03:55:03.222 --> 03:55:07.360 region:rollup2
SAME CONCERNS THAT ANY PROGRAM

03:55:05.058 --> 03:55:08.261 region:rollup2
THAT THE MINISTER THROUGH A CBO

03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:10.830 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE RUNS INTO THAT

03:55:08.261 --> 03:55:11.531 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LONG STANDING LEGACY

03:55:10.830 --> 03:55:14.801 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND.

03:55:11.531 --> 03:55:16.769 region:rollup2
AROUND CAPACITY IN MANY AREAS

03:55:14.801 --> 03:55:18.905 region:rollup2

WHERE POSSIBLE WORKED VERY

03:55:30.183 --> 03:55:33.686 region:rollup2
CLOSELY AND TRY TO IDENTIFY

OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND CAPACITY

03:55:33.686 --> 03:55:37.423 region:rollup2
IN REGIONS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED

03:55:35.455 --> 03:55:38.858 region:rollup2

EXISTING STATUTORY STRUCTURE.

04:08:19.752 --> 04:08:23.222 region:rollup2

A STEP BACK TO LOOK AT WHERE THE

04:08:41.240 --> 04:08:45.711 region:rollup2
GAPS IN SERVICES. ARE BUT THERE

04:08:42.908 --> 04:08:48.247 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY LEGITIMATE ISSUES

04:08:45.711 --> 04:08:50.182 region:rollup2
AROUND PRIORITIZING.

04:08:48.247 --> 04:08:52.117 region:rollup2
VERY COMPELLING.

04:08:50.182 --> 04:08:53.986 region:rollup2

.

04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:17.276 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

04:09:13.739 --> 04:09:18.710 region:rollup2
ALSO TRIES TO COORDINATE CLOSELY

04:09:17.276 --> 04:09:21.346 region:rollup2
WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO

04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:22.714 region:rollup2

EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AT THERE IS A

04:09:26.518 --> 04:09:29.354 region:rollup2
NEED IN THE COMMUNITY YOU MAY

04:09:27.719 --> 04:09:31.123 region:rollup2
HAVE A SERVICE PROVIDER THAT

04:09:32.991 --> 04:09:34.726 region:rollup2
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT HE SAYS

04:09:34.259 --> 04:09:35.894 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IT IT'S A VERY

04:09:34.726 --> 04:09:38.063 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

04:09:35.894 --> 04:09:39.865 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AREA AND SO THEY'RE NOT

04:09:38.063 --> 04:09:41.166 region:rollup2
ALWAYS ABLE TO TO SHIFT

04:09:39.865 --> 04:09:43.068 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AND AND.

04:09:41.166 --> 04:09:44.603 region:rollup2
WE WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE

04:09:43.068 --> 04:09:46.872 region:rollup2
UNWORKABLE TO MAKE THOSE AMOUNTS

04:09:44.603 --> 04:09:48.307 region:rollup2
OF THEM.

04:09:46.872 --> 04:09:49.541 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD TO

04:09:48.307 --> 04:09:50.609 region:rollup2
THAT AND SAY THAT THEIR.

04:09:49.541 --> 04:09:52.678 region:rollup2
ARE STRONG EXISTING STATE

04:09:50.609 --> 04:09:54.179 region:rollup2
PROTECTIONS AROUND THE WAYS THAT

04:09:52.678 --> 04:09:56.114 region:rollup2
EMPLOYERS SOMETIMES TARGET THEIR

04:09:54.179 --> 04:09:56.748 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND A REALLY

04:09:56.114 --> 04:09:58.417 region:rollup2
HIGH LATE THAT.

04:09:56.748 --> 04:09:59.751 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW PART OF THAT I

04:09:58.417 --> 04:10:01.186 region:rollup2
THINK IS MAKING SURE THE

04:09:59.751 --> 04:10:03.355 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT IS AVAILABLE AND

04:10:01.186 --> 04:10:05.057 region:rollup2
PREPARED TO RESPOND ESPECIALLY

04:10:03.355 --> 04:10:05.657 region:rollup2
AT A LOCAL LEVEL WITH REGARDS

04:10:05.057 --> 04:10:07.593 region:rollup2
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IN HER

04:10:05.657 --> 04:10:08.427 region:rollup2
STYLE.

04:10:07.593 --> 04:10:09.461 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE CONCERN AND WHY I

04:10:08.427 --> 04:10:10.729 region:rollup2
BROUGHT IT UP AS WE WENT FROM

04:10:09.461 --> 04:10:12.898 region:rollup2
THIRTY MILLION TO FORTY FIVE

04:10:10.729 --> 04:10:15.300 region:rollup2
MILLION AND YET WE WERE TOLD THE

04:10:12.898 --> 04:10:18.170 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF OUR LOCAL REGION.

04:10:15.300 --> 04:10:19.505 region:rollup2
WAS SET FROM THE YEAR PRIOR THAT

04:10:18.170 --> 04:10:21.073 region:rollup2
IT HAD NOT CHANGED WITH THE

04:10:19.505 --> 04:10:23.408 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN FUNDING. I WOULD

04:10:21.073 --> 04:10:25.844 region:rollup2
HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT LINEARLY

04:10:23.408 --> 04:10:26.812 region:rollup2
INCREASED AS FUNDING INCREASED

04:10:25.844 --> 04:10:29.014 region:rollup2
BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE

04:10:26.812 --> 04:10:31.984 region:rollup2
CASE AND SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO

04:10:29.014 --> 04:10:35.020 region:rollup2
REALLY DO AGAIN AS TIMES CHANGE.

04:10:31.984 --> 04:10:37.089 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FUND NEEDS TO ALSO BE

04:10:35.020 --> 04:10:39.291 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT OUR CURRENT

04:10:37.089 --> 04:10:41.493 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE INTO JUST WANTED

04:10:39.291 --> 04:10:43.262 region:rollup2
TO BRING THAT FORWARD?

04:10:41.493 --> 04:10:45.964 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE BUILDING

04:10:43.262 --> 04:10:48.834 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IS BOTH A FUNCTION OF

04:10:45.964 --> 04:10:52.004 region:rollup2
OF FUNDING AND TIME.

04:10:48.834 --> 04:10:53.472 region:rollup2
IT TAKES ORGANIZATIONS TIME TO

04:10:52.004 --> 04:10:55.774 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO.

04:10:53.472 --> 04:10:57.309 region:rollup2
HIGHER STOCK.

04:10:55.774 --> 04:10:58.610 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THE ADMINISTRATIVE

04:10:57.309 --> 04:11:00.979 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR

04:10:58.610 --> 04:11:01.580 region:rollup2
SOMETIME VERY COMPLEX CASES ON.

04:11:00.979 --> 04:11:03.048 region:rollup2
AND.

04:11:01.580 --> 04:11:06.184 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS FOR

04:11:03.048 --> 04:11:08.153 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE FOR A LEGAL PRACTICE.

04:11:06.184 --> 04:11:09.087 region:rollup2
THAT IS THAT IT'S THAT'S NOT

04:11:08.153 --> 04:11:10.722 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT.

04:11:09.087 --> 04:11:12.324 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS CAN THAT HAPPEN

04:11:10.722 --> 04:11:14.993 region:rollup2
HOW THE PRIOR EXPERIENCE CAN

04:11:12.324 --> 04:11:15.694 region:rollup2
PIVOT TO AND SOMETIMES EVEN EVEN

04:11:14.993 --> 04:11:17.729 region:rollup2
A YEAR.

04:11:15.694 --> 04:11:19.698 region:rollup2
SO.

04:11:17.729 --> 04:11:21.466 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAY

04:11:19.698 --> 04:11:23.335 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A

04:11:21.466 --> 04:11:25.037 region:rollup2
PERFECT CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN

04:11:23.335 --> 04:11:26.505 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN FUNDING AND

04:11:25.037 --> 04:11:28.640 region:rollup2
INCREASED ORGANIZATIONAL

04:11:26.505 --> 04:11:29.908 region:rollup2
CAPACITY. THERE ARE AS I

04:11:28.640 --> 04:11:32.277 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER I BELIEVE LIKE

UNDERSERVED AREAS AND SO WHERE

04:11:38.850 --> 04:11:41.586 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT HAS

BUILD?

04:11:45.924 --> 04:11:49.494 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY SO THAT

04:11:47.659 --> 04:11:50.862 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ABLE TO DELIVER ON

04:11:49.494 --> 04:11:53.165 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT CAN BE VERY

04:11:50.862 --> 04:11:54.533 region:rollup2
COMPLEX AND VERY DEMANDING THEY

STATE FUNDING AND ITSELF
