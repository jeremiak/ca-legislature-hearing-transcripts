OCTOBER TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORTS THAT A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN INDIO CALIFORNIA FOUND A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN.

MISTER GLORIA AMATUS CHAIRMAN THANK YOU AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THIS IS SOMETHING I HAD THE BILL SOME AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IN THE FLORIDA HAD UNICORNS DO SO. I AM I WOULD SAY I THINK THIS IS AN AREA FOR THEIR. ACTION BY THE BY THIS BY THIS COMMITTEE AND WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. RENTAL OR PURCHASE AT IN MY DISTRICT WITH MULTI FAMILY DENSE URBAN WHATEVER. YOU CAN GET BY ON THE RANCH OR THE EIGHT. OR THE MORTGAGE BUT IS THE H. AWAY FEED THAT I DON'T THINK HAS A LOT OF CLARITY IN IT YEAH I THINK SOME OF THE EXCESSES THAT OR THE. BADDIES YOU'RE DESCRIBING A MOMENT AGO. IN AUGUST OF THIS BILL ADDRESSES SOME OF AB OF SOME FURTHER EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE TO TAKE THESE UNITS WHICH ARE MAYBE ON THEIR FACE SOMEWHAT MORE AFFORDABLE BUT ONCE YOU PUT THE H. AWAY FEE ON TOP OF IT. BECOME UNATTAINABLE AND THEN AS WE LOOK AS A STRATEGY OF TRYING TO DO MORE URBAN INFILL AND DENSER. KINDS OF PROPERTIES WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE THE FEES THAT ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER MAKE THE PLACE WORK AND NOT A BARRIER TO ACTUAL HOMEOWNERSHIP. OR OR BE IMPLEMENTED AT A FAIRLY WAIT REASONABLE RATES ARE JUST AN OBSERVATION FOR ADDITIONAL WORK ON IT. THAT THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE IN FOR THE BILL AND MAYBE ENCOURAGED TO DO MORE IN THE SPACE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S A SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD THAT TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC. GREAT THANK YOU AND. I WOULD ALSO AGREE WITH THAT MR GLORIA THINK THIS IS A. SENSIBLE NARROWLY TAILORED APPROACH TO HELPING TO ADDRESS FINANCIAL MISMANAGEMENT AND FRAUD. IN THESE AREAS AND WITH THAT I HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION OF THE COMMITTEE WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM SO WHEN WE DO WE WILL. MAKE THAT MOTION WITH THE FORT. MUCH THANKS FOR VISITING. MISTER DALY. FILE ITEM FIFTEEN AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ALL BEGIN BY CONFIRMING THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS MORNING. AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF AND OUR SPONSORS. AND THE OPPONENTS. AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IF IT DOES MOVE FORWARD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS BILL IS TO STRENGTHEN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT BY CLOSING LOOPHOLES THAT UNDERMINE THE LAWS APPLICABLE WOODY INEFFECTIVENESS. UNDER THAT ACT WHEN PROPOSED PROJECT COMPLIES WITH OBJECTIVE PLANNING RULES THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT DENY THE PROJECT OR REDUCE ITS DENSITY. UNLESS IT MAKES OF FINDING THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC ADVERSE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY. THE CANNOT OTHERWISE BE MITIGATED. UNFORTUNATELY SOME LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE REQUIRED HOUSING PROJECT PROJECTS TO OBTAIN REZONING IS OR VARIANCES ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT BASIS. EVEN WHEN PROJECTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOUSING DENSITY AND OTHER OBJECTIVE STANDARDS. SUCH REZONING IS OR ZONING VARIANCES ARE AWAY FROM LOCALS TO EVADE COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT ON THE GROUNDS THAT PROJECTS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY INCONSISTENT WITH THESE EXISTING ZONING STANDARDS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO UPHOLD THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH IS TO ENSURE THAT MORE HOUSING GETS BUILT CALIFORNIA. HERE TODAY WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF MY BILL ARE. AIRING GUERRERO. OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND MICHAEL LANE WHO'S THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FAHRINGER WITH CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS LAST YEAR THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS PASSED BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO UNDER SIMILAR SITUATION AS TODAY HOUSING CRISIS. SINCE IT WAS PAST IT'S BEEN CONSTANTLY RE JIGGER TRYING TO REALLY CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND MAKE IT EFFECTIVE. AND I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY TO TO THE LOOPHOLES THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE ONE HAS TO DO WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY. AND THE OTHER IS ZONING AND JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE QUICK EXAMPLES. AND IN ONE CITY FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT ZONING. WHICH IS FREE OF ANY DENSITY REQUIREMENTS. THIS BY NECESSITY REQUIRES WHEN YOU GOING TO GET A PROJECT TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE REZONED WHICH AUTOMATICALLY MAKES IT NOT FALL UNDER THAT HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AND A SECOND EXAMPLE RELATED TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND EXEMPTION AND THERE IS A A CITY MEMO WHERE THAT THE CITY STAFF RECOMMENDS. THAT THEY COME UP WITH CREATIVE EXCUSES AND. HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS A LITTLE BIT OF A SOMETIMES A REACH JUST IN ORDER TO EVADE. THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO CLOSE THOSE LOOPHOLES AND TRY TO MAKE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN GET SOME UNITS BUILT. WERE CURRENTLY ON THAT EACH CD SAYS WE NEED TO BUILD ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS A YEAR. AND WE'RE PRODUCING ABOUT HALF OF THOSE SO THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO SPUR. BUILDING AND AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED IT THE MOST THANK YOU. CHURCH IN MEMBER. MICHAEL IN WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION IN CALIFORNIA GREAT WORK WAS DONE LAST YEAR WITH THE HOUSING PACKAGE INCLUDING BILLS BY SOME A MEMBER DALY AND SENATOR SCANNER TO STRENGTHEN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. HOWEVER THERE IS AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED IN LAST YEAR'S LEGISLATION NAMELY THE USE AND ABUSE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY EXEMPTION THE ACT WHICH IS OFTEN GONNA CATCH ON LEUPOLD. TO DELAY DOWNSIZING DENY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. AB THIRTY ONE NINETY FOUR CLARIFIES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ONE HOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARD IN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. IS TO BE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED AND UNDER WHAT LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES IT MAY BE INVOKED. THESE CLARIFICATIONS AB THIRTY ONE NINETY FOUR INCREASE OBJECTIVITY TRANSPARENCY CONSISTENCY AND PREDICTABILITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKING AND PROJECT APPROVALS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR LITIGATION. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE AYE VOTE THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORTERS. HI LIZ BRONTE FROM CALIFORNIA BE I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE AJ'S A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL IN ESPECIALLY ARE MORE EXCLUSIONARY SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES. I'M AFFILIATED WITH AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS A SUCCESSFULLY SUING PLACES LIKE UPLAND SOUTH LEO FOR AJ VIOLATIONS AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IT'S NOT. THIS ISN'T SO MUCH A SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN DIEGO ISSUE THIS IS MUCH MORE OF A AND A EXCLUSIONARY SUBURBAN. THANKS. IT'S A. IN SUPPORT. AND OTHERS. OPPOSITION. CITY GEORGE REPRESENTING AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF AND THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS STAFF WE APPRECIATE THAT. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE ACTUAL AMENDMENTS YET SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY ONE WHERE THE OTHER WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT. OUR MAIN CONCERN IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE ZONING IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT IN THE GENERAL PLAN ARE INCONSISTENT. THAT IF YOU WANT TO USE THE HIGHEST DENSITY IF DEVELOP ONCE YOU THE HIGHEST DENSITY IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S FINE WITH US BUT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT. NOT THE LAND USE ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN IT'S TOO GENERAL IT'S OUT THIRTY YEARS AND I THINK IT INVITES SPRAWL IF YOU'RE NOT REALLY CAREFUL BECAUSE. IF THE DEVELOPER DOESN'T WANNA DO REZONING. AND IT'S MAYBE ZONE FOR HOUSING BUT NOT YET AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PUSHING OUT AG LAND THAT WERE STILL WEAK CONSISTENT WITH S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE. FOR THE TRANSIT IS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IT CETERA SO. IF IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND USE ELEMENT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO AGREE TO THAT IS JUST TO BROUGHT INTO GENERAL IT'S MEANT TO BE. AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH S. B. THREE SEVENTY FIVE WHATEVER CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE BELL. ON THE ISSUE OF. ADVERSE IMPACT THAT DEFINITION AND THERE WERE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT IT DOES IT'S AN INTENT LANGUAGE SECTION. SOME OF THE DAY THAT TERMS THAT ARE USED IN THERE ARE NOT DEFINED SO WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S AND IT'S NOT CLEAR US EXACTLY WHAT IT DOES. ON AND WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO COURT TO DECIDE SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN ISSUES FOR US. CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION I'M ALL JUST ECHO THE ISSUES THAT APA BROUGHT UP REGARDING THE ADVERSE IMPACTS SECTION WE DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCLEAR NEW LANGUAGE. ADDED TO THE BILL AND SO WHILE THE PROPONENTS ARGUING THAT THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE CLARITY WE THINK THAT COURTS ARE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH LITIGATION TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THOSE NEW PROVISIONS ACTUALLY MEAN. SEE STOCK IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING AND ZONING FOR HOUSING IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THE STATE. AND SO WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT THE INTENT OF THIS MIL BILL MIGHT BE FOCUSED ON URBANIZED AREAS AND MAYBE INFILL PROJECTS WHERE. I'M THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ZONING AND NOT BEING AS HIGH AS ALLOWED IN THE GENERAL PLAN WE THINK THERE'S GONNA BE PERVERSE IMPACTS IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS OF THE STATE. WHERE ZONING MAY ALLOW FOR LOW DENSITY HOUSING RIGHT NOW BUT BECAUSE OF THE LONG TERM DESIGNATION IN THE GENERAL PLAN THIS IS ALLOWING AND SOMEONE TO COME IN AND GET A PROJECT APPROVED? THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE UNDERLYING ZONING ORDINANCE AND DOING CONSTRUCTION IN A WAY THAT'S INCONSISTENT WITH OUR BROADER SPRAWL GOALS WITH PROTECTIONS FOR NATURAL RESOURCES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO WE ALSO WOULD APPRECIATE I'M LANGUAGES EPA MENTIONED. TO LINK THIS TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT DENSITIES ON A PARCEL BY PARCEL BASIS RATHER THAN JUST ASSUMING THAT ANY RURAL PARCEL THAT ALLOWS FOR SOME LEVEL OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW. SHOULD BE AT THE MAXIMUM GENERAL PLAN WHEN YOU SAYS A NATION SO AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON THESE ISSUES. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. OPPOSITION. JOINT FORCE WITH THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. OKAY COLLEGE ME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS. I JUST WANNA THANK A MR DEL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN. CHAMPION OF MAKING SURE THAT THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT IS ONE THAT WORKS TO ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT WE NEED OF MAKING SURE THAT JURISDICTION'S ARE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT THEY SHOULD BE BUILDING. DURING OUR HOUSING CRISIS I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS OUGHT TO THIS BILL I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMITTEE ON. FUTURE LANGUAGE I THINK I'M. I HAS SHARED THE CONCERN ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT BE INADVERTENTLY ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT IN GREENFIELDS AN AG LAND BY RELYING TOO HEAVILY ON ZONING AND OUR GENERAL PLAN SO. LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU AND CONTINUE TO REFINE THIS BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE MADE SOME GOOD HEADWAY TODAY. AND DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE THAT SO WITH THAT. BY THE DO PASSES AMENDED RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMITTEE WE CAN'T TAKE A VOTE AT THIS TIME WITHOUT A QUORUM BUT WE'LL DO THAT AT THE APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARM I NEGLECTED TO MENTION THE. CERN THAT I SHARE WITH SOME OF THE OPPONENTS ABOUT. THE DEVELOPMENT IN RURAL AREAS OR ON GREEN FIELDS SO WE ARE WE ARE READY TO CONTINUE TALKING TO ON THAT SUBJECT. ESPECIALLY TO ADDRESS A THE PROSPECT OF SPRAWL. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. IT'S A COLOR. FILE ITEM THIRTEEN AB THIRTY EIGHTY FIVE.

FOUND PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT EITHER WITH THE CITY OR COUNTY ARE WITH PRIVATE BUSINESSES HIRING PARTNERS.

SCOTT ON THE I THINK THIS A GREAT BILL I THINK I'M I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT TODAY A COUPLE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE IN THE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE WAS IS. A GOOD ANGLE AT DOING THIS I WORKED WITH THE UNITED WAY. AYE IN SAN DIEGO ON HOMELESSNESS AND. SECTOR SHAPE THEIR INVOLVEMENT THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN. UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN STRONG SUPPORTERS OF HOMELESSNESS. AND I I THINK TO WHAT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS YOU HAVE MATCHING FUNDS AVAILABLE AND. THE THIS IS ALLOWING CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT ARE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. TO. GET HELP FROM THE STATE BUT IT'S ALSO IN THE FOR THE PLACES THAT DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING ON HOMELESSNESS. IT'S NOT INCLUDING THEM IN THIS WHERE THAT MONEY WOULD GO TO SOMETHING ELSE SO I THINK THIS IS OUR. BOTH THE RIGHT THING TO DO FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT AT HIS FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE AS WELL AND IT'S A IT'S A. GREAT BILL AND I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SUPPORT IT ONCE WE GET A QUORUM IN HERE AND I WAS WISEMAN ON FOR IN A SECOND BUT. IF I'M PLEASED TO MOVE THIS BILL SCRAPED OFF. MISTER GLORIA. THEY CAN IT'S MAIENSCHEIN A LOT OF EXTRA SUCK IT IS WHILE I'M JUST OUT COMMENTS I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S OPERATED SOMETHING LIKE THIS INCENTIVE FOR MANY YEARS WITHOUT THE PROJECT TAKE BACK THE STREETS PROGRAM. I WOULD SAY IN THE CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A STATE TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO SHOW TO. KATHLEEN TAXPAYERS THAT WERE WILLING TO ASK THOSE WHO ARE ABLE BODIED NAY AND WILLING TO WORK TO WORK ON CERTAINLY A GOOD NUMBER OF FOLKS. WHO ARE HOMELESS ARE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THAT BUT FOR THOSE THAT ARE ARE CREATING AN AVENUE? TO PUT THEM TO WORK AYE AS WELL AS TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DEVELOP SKILL SETS THAT CAN ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY SOMEDAY MAKE THEM. THIS. INDEPENDENT I THINK IS ACTUALLY NECESSARY AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FOR TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS LIKE ALFA PROJECTS OF PROJECT IN SAN DIEGO AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR YEARS AND SOME TO GET SOME STATE SUPPORT. A TO CONTINUE THAT WORK WHICH IS REALLY PRODUCTIVE I THINK MR MAIENSCHEIN LIKE I HAVE SEEN OF FOLKS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THAT PROGRAM COME BACK AND AND AND GET BACK ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET WHICH SHOULD BE OUR OBJECTIVE WHEREVER POSSIBLE SO. I APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TO INCLUDE A CEO SEES. I KNOW THAT ARE WHAT WE TRY TO DO IN SAN DIEGO'S CONSOLIDATE ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS UNDER A CONTINUUM OF CARE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT BE. A COLLABORATIVE REALIZED APPROACH SAN DIEGO DOING IT BUT THE AGING TWENTY CITY NOT DOING IT IS NOT IS NOT GONNA CUT IT. AND HOUSING FIRST DE CONNECTION I APPRECIATE THAT ANOTHER I RECOGNIZE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH UNITS OF FOR EVERYONE AND. THE IDEA THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE WORKING. POTENTIALLY GETTING UNIT WOULD BE IDEAL BUT. I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE WITH THE CHAIRMAN TO TO GET THE STUFF BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS BUILT ON THE SCOTT ON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING AFFORDABLE FOR DEVOTING YES. THANK YOU MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I REALLY DO I I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THERE LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS ON HOW WE SOLVE THIS ALMOST CALLS HOMELESSNESS ISSUE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THING THAT WE WE TOOK A LOT OF BIG STEPS LAST YEAR WHEN NOW WE PASS OUR HOUSING STE. MEASURES. AYE BUT AGAIN IT'S A MULTI EFFORT MULTI YEAR EFFORT. WITH MULTI. APPROACHES ON ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE BECAUSE THERE IS DIGNITY THAT COMES WITH HAVING A JOB. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU'RE GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT CAN WORK AS YOU STATED MISTER GLORIA THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INCLUDE THIS AS PART OF A PLANNED. TO TRY TO HELP. SOLVE THE HOMELESS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND AGAIN THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY IF THERE ARE SOME OPENINGS WITH IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT INDIVIDUAL SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO QUALIFY YOU GOTTA BE IN THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING TO. TO TO TO TO BE A TO BE IN LINE WITH THE HOUSING FIRST. REQUIREMENTS AND HOUSING FOR SUPPORT PROGRAM AND AND SO YOU KNOW I I I I I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THESE THESE EXTRA. A NON PROFITS IN ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE CITIES ARE PARTNERING PARTNERING WHAT'S A HIT YET WE CAN GET YOU KNOW SUPPORT HOUSING PROGRAM THAT WE CAN GET YOU A JOB AND.

NOT PREACHY AT THE SUPPORT OF THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND WHEN THERE'S A TIME RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. GREAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. ALRIGHT LET'S GO NOW TO MS COVER EURO TO FILE ITEM FOURTEEN THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. WELCOME. IF YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. CALIFORNIA'S IN THE DEPTHS OF A HOUSING CRISIS MARKED BY A SEVERE LACK OF HOMES AND APARTMENTS AFFORDABLE FOR VERY LOW LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. THERE'S MUCH TO DO TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF BUILDING HOMES AND TO MAKE IT LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO INCREASING SUPPLY AND AFFORDABILITY IS THE IMPOSITION OF EXCESSIVE IMPACT AND DEVELOPER FEES. THAT WERE NOT REQUIRED BY THE SENIOR COUNTY IN INITIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND THAT ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE OVERALL COST OF THE PROPOSED HOUSING UNITS. THAT IS WHY I AM PROUD TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN TODAY WHICH WOULD PROHIBIT CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM CHARGING. ADDING NEW IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES TWO APPLICANTS FOR HOUSING PROJECTS ONCE AN APPLICATION IS DEEMED SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE BY THE JURISDICTION. THESE NEW IMPACT OR DEVELOPMENT FEES ARE USUALLY REQUIRED AS A CONDITION FOR APPROVAL OF ANY PROJECT. AND A DEVELOPER OR BUILDER HAS NO RECOURSE BUT TO AGREE TO THEM IF THEY WANT THE PROJECT APPROVED. HOWEVER ALL TOO OFTEN THESE FEES ARE REVEALED LATE IN THE PROCESS WELL AFTER THE DEVELOPER BUILDER HAS BUDGETED FOR THE PROJECT AND STARTED TO SPEND MONEY ON PROPERTY ACQUISITION. AND PROFESSIONALS BASED ON PUBLIC P. FEE SCHEDULES. IN FACT ACCORDING TO A RECENT UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING AND INNOVATION STUDY. CERTAINTY FOR DEVELOPER FEES IS A SIMPLE POLICY CHANGE AND POLICY MAKERS AT ALL LEVEL WORKING TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING SHORTAGE SHOULD BEGIN WITH. IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT AS A DEVELOPER BUILDER TO BUDGET A PROJECT IN A BAD ABOUT. A MISSED THE UNCERTAINTIES AS TO WHAT FEES REQUIREMENTS OR OTHER FEES COULD COME INTO PLAY. AT ANY STAGE OF THE PROCESS WHEN DEVELOPMENT FEES ARE NOT REVEALED NOT READILY ACCESSIBLE REASONABLE AND PREDICTABLE IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT. A PLAN BUDGET AND BUILD WHICH ONLY EXACERBATES CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE I WISH TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN THE CHAIR FOR ALL OF THEIR HARD WORK. AND COMMIT TO TAKE THE COMMUNITY THE HOUSING COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH ONE DEFINE THE IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES UNQUOTE. AND ADD THREE OFF RAMPS THAT PROVIDE RELIEF FROM THESE REQUIREMENTS SEQUEL HEALTH AND SAFETY AND INFLATION COSTS ESCALATORS. I WILL TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGREE TO THEM. CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND ONE WE CANNOT IGNORE I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. WITH ANY OPPOSITION THAT SHOULD REMAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. UP WITH ME IN SUPPORT IS LA SUBSTANCE IN CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ACTUALLY IF WE COULD JUST FOR A MOMENT DOCTOR WHAT. COULD WE JUST A TAKE A QUORUM BEFORE YOU HEAD OUT. PERFECT EVEN BETTER SORRY SO I STARTED ME TO CUT YOU OFF JUST WANNA IS GOING TO GET THERE COMMITTEE BUSINESS IN ORDER. WANNA GRAB HIM WHILE HE'S HERE I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK GREAT THANK YOU AND. WANT WE WANT WE CALL QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY CHIU HERE THROUGH HERE. MAIENSCHEIN. THEIR MAIN CHIANG HERE CHAU. CHOI. GLORIA GLORIA HERE LAMONT. WHO WOULD? WELL WE HAVE QUORUM THANK YOU. WITHOUT TWO WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSISTANCE IN HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THE SPONSORS OF AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF AND SECOND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CABALLERO SO EXPERTLY STATED ABOUT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AGAIN THE NATURE OF THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD HELP TAKE A STEP IN ADDRESSING THAT. WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE OF JUST HOW DIRE THIS HOUSING CRISIS HAS BEEN SINCE THE BOTTOM OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS HAS BEEN THE SLOWEST RECOVERY IN HISTORY AND WE ARE STILL NOWHERE NEAR A HEALTHY HOUSING MARKET. EVERY DAY WE SEE CALIFORNIANS HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WORSEN WHILE THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET WE CAN TAKE MEANINGFUL STEPS TO ENSURING TRANSPARENCY IN CONTAINING THE COSTS. THIS BILL IS ONE OF THOSE MEANINGFUL STEPS BY SEEKING TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY AROUND THE CONSTANT. AROUND THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING FEES THAT ARE LEVIED ON HOUSING PROJECTS. WHILE WE HAVE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO PAYING THESE IMPACT FEES AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL THERE'S ALSO GROWING CONCERN THAT THESE EXACTIONS ARE REVEALED LATE IN THE PROCESS CAUSING PROJECTS TO BE RECONSIDERED. AND DRIVING UP THE COST ON FUTURE HOME BUYERS. CREATING THE SHIRT HE AROUND THESE FEES INVOLVING. HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS ALLOWS A PROJECT. ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE HOUSING AT LEVELS CITIZENS CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD. EACH LATE HATE CANNOT THOUSANDS TO THE COSTS AND IN CALIFORNIA EVERY TIME THERE'S AN INCREASE OF A IN THE COST OF A HOME BY A THOUSAND DOLLARS IT PRICES ON OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER STUDY FOR HOUSING ERSTE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION RELEASED A STUDY LAST MONTH REGARDING THE OVERALL COST OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FEES. BY DOING A CASE STUDY OF SEVEN CALIFORNIA CITIES AMONG THE MAIN FINDINGS THEY SUGGESTED THAT CALIFORNIA ADOPT A FEE TRANSPARENCY POLICY AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES FOR SETTING IN CHARGING FEES AND TO DEFINE WHEN FEES CAN BE LEVIED. AND CHANGED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. I WOULD LIKE TO AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE.

WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT A. B. THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS. WE UNDER PRODUCE HOUSING UNITS FOR FROM NUMEROUS YEARS NOW AND ONE REASON FOR THAT IS THE HIGH IN EXCESS OF BECAUSE OF FEES. AB THIRTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY AND FAIRNESS TO THE FEE PROCESS. IT WILL MAKE HIM. MAJOR DAN AND SOLVING OUR HOUSING CRISIS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO OTHER SUPPORTERS. NONPROFIT. CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. YEAH I GOT IT WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. LOUIS MANDE WITH CALIFORNIANS TRANSPORT.

LET'S GO NOW TO THE OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING TRACY RIGHT FOR A CAR REPRESENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS A COMMITTED TO TAKING DO. HELP WITH THIS BILL WE DO HAVE CONCERNS. WE WOULD NEED TO SEE THE LANGUAGE. BEFORE THAT WE WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION BUT I THINK THAT THE OVERALL ISSUE OF THE BILL BEING PREMATURE STILL EXISTS. LAST YEAR EIGHTY EIGHT SEVEN NINE WAS PASSED. BY THIS BODY AND PROVIDES A A HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES LEVIED DURING DEVELOPMENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE A BETTER WAY. TO MAKE THIS DECISION BASED ON DATA UP FROM THAT REPORT AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THIS DECISION IS IS LOOKED AT NEXT YEAR THANK YOU. SENATE GEORGE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. WE DID WORK WITH THE STAFF OF THE AUTHOR WE APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO COMMITTEE STAFF ON THIS BILL. WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN. UP UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT ARE STILL NOT FIXED IN THE BILL THAT ARE HUGE ISSUES FOR US. WE CANNOT PASS ON IMPACTS FOR A FIRE STATION OR WATER TREATMENT FACILITY TO SOMEBODY ELSE. IF WE GET REDEVELOPMENT BACK IN THAT CAN BUY DOWN THOSE COSTS WERE READY TO DO THAT HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WELL. BUT WE CANNOT AGREE TO JUST NOT IMPOSING THE FEES. WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THE APPLICATION STAGE TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT THE FEES WILL BE FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT. WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE OFF RAMPS BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH WE JUST ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO PUBLISH OUR FEES SO THAT THE. DEVELOPER CAN CALCULATE HIM OR HERSELF WHAT THE FEES ARE WE WILL GIVE THEM AN ESTIMATE AT THE TIME OF THE APPLICATION CATION STAGE. WE AGREED TO ADD ENTITLEMENT FREEZING THE FEES FOR TWO YEARS WE CAN'T DO UNLIMITED FREEZING OF FEES. WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS TO NOT BUILD SOON AND WE ARE TRYING TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE. BUILT AS SOON AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO UNFORTUNATELY OF THE WAY THE BILL IS RIGHT NOW WE STILL VERY MUCH OPPOSE THINKING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. CHILDREN OF COURSE ABOUT THE URBAN CARRIES A CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. CHRISSY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL. BY ONE MAKE CLOTHES LARIFIED A PRACTICABLE THINGS UP FOR STUFF AND FORGIVE ME I'M IS COMING OR DID YOU ACCEPT THE. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. YES WE HAVE A WE HAVE NEGOTIATED ON AMENDMENTS WHICH WHICH ONES I JUST WANNA BE REAL CLEAR THAT THAT YEAH I'M ASKING THE. ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT I CAN I CAN ARTICULATE AND THAT WAS GREAT DOUBLE CHECK SO. THAT WE IT'S JUST OF THREE MOMENTS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. WE WILL NOT BE TAKING THE FIRST AMENDMENT AROUND THE PUBLICATION A REQUIREMENT ON THE WEBSITE. WE WILL TAKE THE SECOND AMENDMENT OF A DEFINING IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES AS THOSE FEES ARE ESTABLISHED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEN FOR THE THIRD. WHAT WE AGREED TO WAS TO FREEZE THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT FEES ARE WITHOUT INCLUDING COMMUNITY BENEFIT AGREEMENTS AT THE POINT THAT THE PROJECT OUT WHEN THAT WHEN THE PROJECT APPLICATION IS COMPLETE? AND REQUIRE THOSE FEES TO BE FROZEN FOR UP TO TWO YEARS SO THAT'S WHAT. WE HAVE WORKED OUT. YOU SO TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR IT THAT BANKING MISTREATMENT IN IN YOU TAKING. ONE IN THREE BUT NOT TO. ACTUALLY TWO AND TWO AND THREE SLIGHTLY AMENDED NOT ONE. GOT IT OKAY YEAH I THINK IT WAS HIGH LEVEL THAT IS REALLY HIGH NUMBERS THAT I HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING UP WITH. SO I THINK CERTAINTIES REALLY IMPORTANT AND I AND I KNOW OUR FRIENDS THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY FEEL THE SAME WAY IN ANOTHER OF US WOULD BUY A BIG MAC IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PRICE IT WAS. ON THE FRONT BY EVE SPEC THAT AS A CONSUMER NOTHING SHOULD BE DIFFERENT. I THINK THAT JURISDICTION'S SHOULD PUBLISH THESE I RECOMMEND THIS DYNAMIC BUT ONCE THE. PROJECT IS DEEMED COMPLETE THEN THEY PURCHASE THE RIGHT THAT THAT'S THAT'S HIDDEN THEY CAN SHIFT LATER BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE PIPELINE THING IN THAT SHOULD BE HELD SEPARATELY. I I I I GUESS THAT THAT THAT THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAD BASS NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND THE CLARITY ON ON THE AMENDMENTS. TO BE SUPER CLEAR COMMUNITY BENEFITS SO YOU DID AS WAS MENTIONED THAT'S NOT INCLUDED THAT'S CORRECT I'M NIGHT IS ONE OF THE DESPITE EXPAND ON THAT JUST A LITTLE BIT YOU KNOW I DIDN'T MISS COMEY ON AYE BOTH SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I THINK WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT SOMETIMES TAKES TO GET A PROJECT. APPROVED OF BY DECISION BODY OUT AND THAT'S REALLY SEPARATE FROM FEES NUMBER TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS SUPER CLEAR IN TODAY'S HEARING I KNOW IT'S IN THE BACK UP. HERE NEAR TO IT SAYING YES. BUT WE ARE THE END GOAL YOUR OBJECTIVE IN THIS ACTUALLY BUILD MORE HOUSING RIGHT AND TO REMOVE A DECISION MAKING BODIES ABILITY TO ACCESS A SIKH COMMUNITY BENEFITS IN ORDER TO GET A PROJECT TO PROVE. THAT WE WOULD WANT TO GIVE UP THAT OPPORTUNITY RIGHT RIGHT. AND THEN BUSTED OUT WE THIS IS NOT INCLUSIVE OF UTILITIES THAT'S CORRECT IS A BOOK OF MUNICIPAL UTILITIES AND PRIVATE UTILITIES CRACKED SO THAT THE WHOLE IDEA IS. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO AFFECT THE HOOK UPS ALL OF THAT SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING IN ADDITION THERE THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT FIRE STATION. AND. IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A FIRE STATION BECAUSE YOU'RE BUILDING A WHOLE NEW DEVELOPMENT THEN YOU BETTER START THE PROCESS STERN GET UP TO GET A FEE. AND BE ABLE TO ADD THAT IN SO I'M NOT TRYING TO. STOP THAT OR IF YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT PROCESS TO SAY YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THAT PROCESS BECAUSE I JUMPED IN AND I GOT MY. MY APPLICATION COMPLETE WHAT IT REALLY IS A STELLAR IS TO HIGHLIGHT HERE'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE'S. HERE'S. THE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON YOUR ON YOUR PROJECT AND THAT WAY YOU HAVE A PART AN OPPORTUNITY PARTICIPATE AS PART OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS AS WELL SO. GROUP BUT IS NOT INCLUSIVE OF UTILITIES THAT'S CORRECT IT'S NOT PRIVATE WHICH YOU INCREASINGLY I HEAR FROM SOME OF MY FOLKS IN SAN DIEGO THAT'S A PROBLEM AS WELL YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG TICKET. INVOICE IT SENT TO THEM IT IS. AND SO YOU KNOW I I DID PARTY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL CONTINUE TO TRY AND LOOK AT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE BECAUSE I HEAR THAT'S A CONCERN PROVOKES ARE TRYING TO BUILD HOUSING BUT. I LIVED LEADS WHAT I'M THIS IS REALLY A WORKING PROXY PROGRESS IN PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS THAT THE ONES THAT ARE. THAT ARE REQUIRED BY LAW ALREADY WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THOSE WERE JUST TRYING TO SAY YOU'VE GOT TO TELL. YOU GOT IT PARTICULATE THEM AND THEN. IF YOU'RE GOING TO INCREASE THEM FOR ANY REASON YOU GOTTA GO TO THE REGULAR PUBLIC PROCESS AND. AND THAT THAT THOSE ARE NOT THE ONES WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONCE GET ADDED ON. WITHOUT ANY NEXUS OR CONNECTION TO ANYTHING. WHO LASSOED TO SAY THAT THE PROVISION FOR A THIS BEING GOOD FOR TWO YEARS I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP COMMUNITIES HOLE RIGHT I MEAN IF? IF SOMEONE'S A SLOW WALK IN OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO GET IN ON A BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE E. YOUR BILL DOES NOT SPEAK TO THAT SO. HE THIS IS GOOD FOR TWO YEARS BUILD OR YOU LOSE THAT OR YOU LOSE THE FREEZING OF THE FEET STRIKE I THINK THAT'S EMILY REASONABLE I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATION TO BE OUT THERE FOR WORKING SO HARD TO USE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR VERY DEEP ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE I THINK YOU AND I HAD MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL THAN ANY OTHER BILL THAT I HAVEN'T FOR ME TODAY. AND I ALSO WERE VERY MUCH I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF CERTAINTY AND TRANSPARENCY OF WHAT DEVELOPERS HAVE TO PAY. IN ORDER MOVE THINGS FORWARD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS AND. AGAIN TO ALSO JUST CLARIFY. IT WE WOULD BE FREE SEEN IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES ONE THE APPLICATION'S COMPLETE NOT INCLUDING. COMMUNITY BENEFIT AGREEMENTS UTILITY FEES ETCETERA SO. I ALSO WILL JUST CLARIFY THAT THESE AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD BE TAKEN UP BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE TODAY ALONG WITH OTHERS THAT THEY MAY THINK ABOUT AS IT MOVES THROUGH COMMITTEE. BUT I JUST THINK IF YOUR WORK I I DO YOU LOOK FOR TO ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON THIS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS AND IF THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN HANDLE. SOME THESE THORNY ISSUES BUT I THINK THE GOAL IS ONE THAT THAT I SUPPORT AND I THINK MANY THIS COMMITTEE WANNA SUPPORTS WE LOOK FOR TO THE CONTINUE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE SHOULD MISTER CHAIR I REALLY DO APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS GREAT ANY OTHER FILE CULTS. ACTUALLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE OKAY A WE DO A QUORUM SO THERE'S BEEN A MOTION BY MISTER GLORIOUS OUR SECOND. SECOND BY DOCTOR WOULD. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONLESS TO PASS REFERRED TO. A COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. CHIU PIPE CHIU AYE MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN NIGHT CHAO. CHOI GLORIA. GLORIA IDLING LONG. WHO WOULD? WOULD I. RIGHT. VERY MUCH IF FOR VOTES YOUR BILL IS OUT AND WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS LET'S NOW GO TO MISS FRIEDMAN. S. FREEMAN HAS TWO ITEMS TODAY. FILE ITEM THREE AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THREE AND FILE ITEM FOR A. B.. TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE MY UNDERSTANDING IS ARE YOU LIKE FOR FILE AND THREE FOR US TO BRING THAT UP FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. IDEA TO TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST OR CALLING FOR WE'RE GONNA START WITH TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE OKAY LET'S GET THE BUSINESS OUT OF THE WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR THE DEDICATED WORK ON THIS MEASURE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE. IS TRYING TO. CREATE UNIFORM AND MORE TRANSPARENCY WHEN IT COMES TO LOCALS PROCESSING A DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION IN A MORE CONSISTENT TIMELY WAY. THE DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION PROCESS HAS BECOME LONG AND ARDUOUS IN MANY AREAS AND CAN DELAY PROJECTS AND ULTIMATELY CATALYZE A PROJECTS DEMISE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE GIVES MORE ASSURANCE TO DEVELOPERS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THEIR DENSITY BONUS APPLICATION BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPORT BACK TO DEVELOPERS AT THE TIME OF THEIR APPLICATION IS DEEMED COMPLETE. THE INCENTIVES THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR A CITY COUNTY CITY OR. A CITY COUNTY OR. I MUST INFORM THE DEVELOPER OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS PARKING RATIO INCENTIVES CONCESSIONS ARE WAIVERS ARE REDUCTIONS IN DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WHETHER THE APPLICANT PROVIDE ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. SHOULD THE PROJECT DRASTICALLY CHANGE AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY IS FOR THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF THE DENSITY BONUS THE PARKING RATIOS WAIVERS AGAIN SOFT CONCESSIONS DEEMED ELIGIBLE. BASED ON THOSE CHANGES DURING THE COURSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT. THIS BILL BUILDS ON RICHARD BLOOM SPILL AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE WHICH REQUIRES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO NOTIFY A DENSITY BONUS APPLICANT IF THEIR APPLICATION IS COMPLETE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR CERTAINTY FOR THE DEVELOPER AND FLEXIBILITY FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHEN PROCESSING THE APPLICATIONS. THE BILL ALSO DECLARES A LEGISLATURE'S INTENT BY ESTABLISHING A UNIFORM PROCESS FOR THE REVIEW OF DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS. INCLUDING THE REQUEST FOR AN SENATE'S CONCESSIONS WAIVERS ON REDUCTIONS OF DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS IN A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN AND APPLIES TO ALL CITIES INCLUDING CHARTER CITIES. THE LEGISLATURE HAS DECIDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS A PRIORITY AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE GIVES DEVELOPERS THE CERTAINTY INSURANCE. ABOUT INCENTIVE TO DO THAT THIS BILL HAS NO REGISTERED OPPOSITION WITH ME TODAY I HAVE MICHAEL CUSUMANO A LOCAL DEVELOPMENT IN MY DISTRICT IN BURBANK. TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHAEL CUSUMANO. AS WE ALL KNOW OUR STATE IS IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE ARE ESPECIALLY DEFICIENT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR STATE. THIS IS NOT NEWS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IN RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS YOU'VE ENACTED LAWS OVER THE PAST YEARS IN THE PAST DECADE SUCH AS THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. THE PROVIDE A PATHWAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY TO CREATE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AT NO ADDITIONAL COST THE PUBLIC. MANY CITIES HOWEVER ESPECIALLY THOSE CITIES THAT HAVE NOT MET THEIR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OBLIGATIONS FREQUENTLY DELAY OR SIMPLY TO RIFF REFUSED TO PROCESS. HOUSING PROJECTS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU HOUSING BUILT IN THEIR CITIES AND THEY CERTAINLY DON'T WANT SACRAMENTO DICTATING TO THEM. THAT THEY MUST ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TAKE THE CITY OF BURBANK FOR EXAMPLE. THE CITY OF BURBANK IS ADDED OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND NEW JOBS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BUT ONLY FIFTY FIVE UNITS OF NEW HOUSING. THIS RESULT HAS RESULTED IN AN ACUTE HOUSING CRISIS IN THAT CITY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS CREATED LAW SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING PROJECTS THE PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN COMMUNITIES LIKE BURBANK. THAT FALL SHORT OF MEETING THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT ALLOCATIONS. BUT CURRENT LAW DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR DEFIED SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS OR TIME FRAMES. FOR CITIES TO PROCESSES APPLICATIONS. IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT THE EASIEST WAY TO STOP A PROJECT IS NOT TO DENY IT. BUT JUST TO DO DELAY IT UNTIL IT DIES ON ITS OWN. AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE WILL PROVIDE FOR SPECIFIC GUIDELINES IN A REASONABLE TIME FRAMES FOR CITIES TO REVIEW DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS. NOTE THAT THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO PROJECT BEING SUBMITTED AS DENSITY BONUS APPLICATIONS WHICH QUALIFY UNDER THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GUIDELINES IT DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU LUXURY HOUSING PROJECTS OR OFFICE BUILDING PROJECTS OR OTHER PROJECTS THAT DON'T HAVE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHIN THEM. IN ALL OF THESE DENSITY PRIZE OF DENSITY BONUS PROJECTS OF REMAIN SUBJECT TO FULL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW UNDER SEAQUEST. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HOUSING A BALANCE THAT IS EVIDENT IN OUR STATE. IT MUST TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR PRINT THE PRIVATE SECTOR. PLAYED A ROLE IN CREATING A SOLUTION AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY THREE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. THANK YOU. THE KILLERS GOT OTHER SUPPORTERS. CITY GEORGE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION. ASSESSMENT STEPPED. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. AS AMENDED WERE NOW IN FULL SUPPORT. SO WE JUST WENT EXPRESS THAT THINKS. THANK YOU NEXT. PORTER SHAWN TO PICK IT UP WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. REBECCA MARKETS REPRESENTING LEADING H. CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. AARON CAREER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. OTHER SUPPORTERS. ANY OPPOSITION. CASEY NOW LET'S BRING THIS. OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA SO LEASE SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA APOLOGIES TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR THE LATE. AND OPPOSITION ARE THE SPELL WE JUST TOOK A POSITION YESTERDAY EYES SO I APOLOGIZE I'M THE CITY HAS ANALYZE THE BILL MAY DETERMINE THAT THE BILL PLACES OWNER ES ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON CITIES TO COMPILE THIS INFORMATION FOR EACH DENSITY BONUS PROJECT. THE CITY IS DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN ON. CLARIFYING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. OUR OTHER CONCERN IS FISCAL THAT THE SKIN AT ADDED COST TO THE PROPER AND TO THIS REVIEW AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE REIMBURSED BY THE STATE SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE'D LIKE TO ADDRESS BUT. AM THOSE ARE CONCERNS THINKING. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I WAS ABOUT TO COMPLEMENT YOU FOR MOVING FOR THE DENSITY BONUS BILL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID OPPOSITION ON BUT THIS IS A DENSELY MONA'S BILL. BUT. BUT YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF HARD WORK TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND I KNOW THAT YOU TOOK AMENDMENTS EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THAT DID REMOVE. THE OPPOSITION AT THE TIME. I AND I DO HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE BUT. LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION BY THE COMMITTEE. CA NINETY OF ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU LIKE TO MAKE JUST THIS IS WHAT A REAL ISSUE MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE DEVELOPERS WHO WANT TO COME INTO THESE PROJECTS AND WE DO DESPERATELY NEEDED AND IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN TO SEE THE PROJECTS TO STALLED INTO OBLIVION IS BEEN VERY VERY FRUSTRATING AND I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT. THE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AND MR BECAUSE SOMEONE ELSE WAS WILLING TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS AND I AGAIN THANK YOU AND I URGE MY VOTE. RIGHT IS OUR MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. MOTION BY DOCTOR WOULD SECOND BY MISTER GLORIA. MADAM SECRETARY. MOTION TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMEDIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT CHU. CHU AYE MAIENSCHEIN MAIENSCHEIN AYE CHILD. CHOI. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LEE MONTH. WOULD. WOULD I. YOUR BILLS OUT WE WILL ADD ON. OTHERS HANDLED ONE WE NOW GO TO FILE ITEM THREE AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THREE I JUST REITERATE THIS IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. MISTREATMENT. THANK YOU. THIS BILL IS SOMETHING THAT I FIND EXTREMELY INTRIGUING AND WANTED TO BRING IT TO YOU AND. TODAY BECAUSE I'M GOING TO PURSUE IN THE FUTURE WE FEEL THAT WE DO NEED WORK ON IT. I WANT TO THANK MISTER CHAIR AND HIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HIS STAFF FOR HELPING US I GET THIS FAR WITH THE BILL. THE IDEA BEHIND THIS BILL IS TO TRY TO BRING MUCH NEEDED HOUSING INTO OUR URBAN AREAS AND TO EAT THE TO ENCOURAGE VERTICAL HEIGHT AS A WAY OF NOT ONLY ADDING MORE UNITS BUT A PERVERT PRESERVING OPEN SPACE. AND BE MORE EFFICIENT AND HOW WE BUILD BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS OF BUILDING LARGER BUILDINGS THAT REQUIRE STEEL FRAME THESE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN ARE REAL RARITY IN THE AREAS WHERE WE NEED THE MOST HOUSING. I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF MY OWN HOME CITY OF GLENDALE WHERE WE DID A PROGRAMMATIC  <u><c.green>I OUR FOR OUR</c></u> DOWNTOWN TO REALLY TRY TO ENCOURAGE HOUSING. AND WE GOT SEVERAL APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN PROBABLY EIGHT OR NINE BUILDINGS AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BUILDINGS. EVEN THOUGH THAT THE LOTS WERE ZONED FOR TWENTY STORIES. ALL OF THOSE BUILDINGS ARE UNDER SIX STORIES BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS OF BUILDING THOSE LARGER BUILDINGS WHICH IN MY MIND WAS A REAL MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE NOT ONLY MORE HOUSING AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT LARGER UNITS FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOVING IN BECAUSE TO MAKE THOSE PRO. FORMAS WORK ON THE SHORTER BUILDINGS THEY REALLY HAVE TO CRAM THE UNITS AND AND THEY END UP WITH VERY SMALL UNITS WHICH AFFECTS BUT RESIDENTS QUALITY OF LIFE. AND WHAT WE END UP WITH LESS BE ABLE TO HOUSE LESS PEOPLE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A DAY. DRIVING INTO THAT VERY AREA TO WORK SO WE HAVE THE GOAL IN THE STATE OF HAVING MORE DANCE HOUSING NEAR OUR JOB CENTERS AND THE PLACES HERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO A RECREATION. AND YET WE HAVE THIS ECONOMIC HURDLE THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR DEVELOPERS TO OVERCOME TO FULLY UTILIZE THE LAND THAT'S THERE IN THOSE AREAS. SO OUR SPONSOR BROUGHT A VERY INTERESTING CONCEPT FOR THAT I'D LIKE HIM TO A TO TALK ABOUT AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. WE FEEL THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON THIS BILL WHEN WHEN HE'S FINISHED. BUT HIS FAMILY MEMBER AYE IT THANK YOU I CHAIR CHAIRMAN CHIU. AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE KING CELL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UP FOR GROWTH CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE PROJECT OF THE UP FOR GROWTH NATIONAL COALITION. UP FOR GROWTH IS A DIVERSE AND GROWING COALITION OF HOUSING PRODUCERS MAJOR EMPLOYERS AND OTHER PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS HAVE JOINED TOGETHER TO PROMOTE POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE AND ENABLE MORE HOUSING ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. ACCESSIBLE TO JOBS IN TRANSPORTATIONS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS PROPOSED BY AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THREE THE VERTICAL HOUSING PROGRAM IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PROVEN STRATEGY LAUDED BY ON THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN AND AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AND IS USED ACTUALLY IN TWELVE STATES AROUND THE U. S.. TO REDUCE AND INNATE BARRIERS AND ENABLE DENSE WALKABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION NEAR TRANSIT. BY INDUCING INVESTMENTS TO CREATE PROJECTS THAT MAXIMIZE SEVEN CAPACITY NEAR TRANSIT STATIONS THE VERTICAL HOUSING PROGRAM PROVIDES THE MISSING FINANCING TO PRODUCE SCORES OF AFFORDABLE AND MARKET RATE UNITS. WITHIN  GIVEN PROJECT THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE BUILT WITHOUT THIS TOOL WHILE BRINGING AT THE SAME TIME THE PER UNIT COST DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AND AT LEAST DOUBLING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AYE IN UNDERLYING TAX BASIS COMPARED TO SIMILAR. SIMILAR DEVELOPMENT. THERE WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE PRODUCED UNDER THE STATUS QUO. THIS PROVISION RIVER REFLECTS BOTH A HIGHER LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE UNITS SET ASIDE WITHIN A GIVEN PROJECT. THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE GENERATED AND DEEPER LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY THAT IS REQUIRED UNDER CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND THE BILL WOULD PRODUCE AFFORDABLE UNITS AT AROUND HALF OF THE COST OF WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD DEVELOP ON THEIR OWN. THE PROGRAM PAYS FOR THE COST OF THE INCREASED DENSITY IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED IN DOES NOT ACCRUE TO DEVELOPER PROFIT. ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN A HIGHER DENSITY PROJECT COSTS ROUGHLY THIRTY PERCENT MORE PER SQUARE FOOT ON AVERAGE. THEN TO BUILD A LOWER DENSITY I HOUSING PROJECT YET RENTS IN MANY PLACES EVEN AROUND TRANSIT ARE NOT THIRTY PERCENT HIGHER. TO PROVIDE FOR THAT DENSER PROJECT TO MAKE. FINANCIAL. SENSE ESPECIALLY WHEN AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE CONTEMPLATED AS PART OF THE PROJECT IN OTHER WORDS IS FAR MORE ECONOMICALLY RATIONAL TO BUILD LOW DENSITY PROJECTS RATHER THAN HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS. NOW WHICH ULTIMATELY COST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MUCH NEEDED OUR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. CONTACT DEVELOPMENT HOUSING UNITS IN FOR GOES THE PROP POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE UNITS ALTOGETHER. IN FACT RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN IN MANY AREAS AROUND THE STATE. WITHIN A HALF MILE RING AROUND TRANSIT WHO DID THAT THE PRODUCERS OF MID RISE LOWER DENSITY APARTMENT BUILDINGS ARE ABLE TO PAY MORE FOR LAND AND. THEN THE DEVELOPERS OF HIGH RISE MORE UNIT. LARGER APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IT'S OF THIS THIS VEHICLE THIS TOOL PROVIDES A WAY FOR HIGH DENSITY PROJECTS TO PENCIL OUT. I LIKELY PROVIDING THE SAME RETURNS TO THE HOUSING PRODUCER AS WITH THE LESS EXPENSIVE LOWER DENSITY PROJECT THAT DOESN'T OFFER THE SAME PUBLIC BENEFITS AS THIS INCREASED DENSITY WOULD. ESSENTIALLY THIS VEHICLE BRIDGES THE DELTA IN CREATES AN ECONOMIC RATIONALE FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD A HIGH DENSITY WALKABLE PROJECT TO REALIZE THE FULL SUITE. OF PUBLIC BENEFITS INCLUDING IN ADDITION TO THE QUANTITY QUALITY AND AFFORDABILITY BENEFITS ARE CREATING ADDITIONAL AYE JOB CREATION AND EMPLOYMENT INCOME. CAUSING DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN VEHICLE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS BECAUSE THE PROJECTS WOULD BE LOCATED NEAR TRANSIT STATIONS AND SERVING INCOMING POPULATIONS THROUGH ACCOMMODATE OF WHAT WE CALL IN PLACEMENT RATHER THAN THE DISRUPTIVE DISPLACEMENT. OF EXISTING POPULATIONS AND ON THAT LAST POINT THIS LEGISLATION ALSO INCORPORATES IDENTICAL DISPLACEMENT LANGUAGE FROM LAST YEAR'S S. B. THIRTY FIVE BARRING DISPLACEMENT THROUGH DEMOLITION AND REDEVELOPMENT. WOULD ALSO HELP IMPROVE I INVESTMENT IN ECONOMICALLY DIVESTED COMMUNITIES. THIS PROGRAM WOULD MAKE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICIES MORE WORKABLE ACROSS THE STATE MANDATES UNTETHERED FROM ECONOMIC REALITY REQUIRING THE PRODUCTION OF A CERTAIN KIND OF HOUSING QUICKLY BECOME JUST ANOTHER BARRIER. TO PRODUCING ANY KIND OF HOUSING AT ALL. THE VERTICAL HOUSING PROGRAM PROVIDES OF A VIABLE FINANCING MODEL TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE ENABLE MORE UNITS THROUGH INCLUSIONARY HOUSING POLICIES THAT THAT THAT THOSE POLICIES WOULD OTHERWISE SEEK TO MANDATE. INTO REALITY AND FINALLY THE PROGRAM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACHIEVE AFFORDABILITY GOALS AND ACCOMPLISHES WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD TYPICALLY REQUIRE. DOUBLE THE CAPITAL TO ACHIEVE EITHER BY DELIVERING PROJECTS THEMSELVES WERE BY BUYING DOWN RENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND APPRECIATE THE TIME. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ANYMORE REPRESENTING BRIDGE HOUSING A BRIDGE HOUSING IS A NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER I THAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY THAT MOST OF THE LARC. MANY OF THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PROJECTS IN THE STATE PRIMARILY INFILL AND IN URBAN AREAS. WE APPRECIATE. YET THE OFF THAT WE SUPPORT THE BILL WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRINGING THE CONVERSATION FORWARD ABOUT HAVING ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT. POST REDEVELOPMENT. HAVING HOUSING INCREMENTS FINANCE AYE IS AN IMPORTANT. MECHANISM FOR BRINGING LARGE PROJECTS FORWARD. ARE AND WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN CORNELIUS BURKE WITH THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. WE SUPPORT THE BILL WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELL. ON THIS BILL INCREASES HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. PROVIDES ELEGANT DENSITY AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON THIS BILL IN THE FUTURE. LIMITS OF THEIR OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL AS IT IS AGAIN THIS IS FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY. SHOT OF TAKING WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING JUSTIN FANS ALL BE HAVE A TECHNET IN SUPPORT. LOUIS Y. DIFFERENT CALIFORNIAN BE IN SUPPORT. AND LET ME ASK IS THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IT IS MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING DAVID WOLFE THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. MEMBERS WERE I THINK REALLY INTRIGUED BY THE CONCEPT OF VERTICAL HOUSING. WITH OIL AND GROWING IN EXPENSIVE AND DOWN THE STATE. EXPLORING VERTICAL HOUSING ESPECIALLY IN HIGH TRANSIT AREAS I THINK MAKES A HIGH DEGREE OF SENSE. HOWEVER WORK CONCERNED WITH THIS SPELL AS YOU'VE BEEN CONCERNED WITH OTHER BILLS REGARDING BRINGING BACK SOME FORM OR ANOTHER OF REDEVELOPMENT. REGARDING THE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL THRESHOLD. IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN EITHER TAX INCREMENT FINANCING OR APPROVING BONDS AGAIN THIS IS NOT A FOREIGN POSITION FOR US WE TESTIFIED HERE LAST WEEK AGAINST AB THIRTY THIRTY SEVEN AS WELL. ON THAT FRONT. I THINK ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH TAX INCREMENT FINANCING AND MONEY BEING TAKEN FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS IN BEING DIVERTED FOR SOME OTHER CAUSE. HAVING THAT VOTER APPROVAL WHICH LASTS FAR BEYOND. THE DEBT THAT WAS APPROVED EITHER BY THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE OTHER LOCAL ENTITY. AND NOT JUST MAKES AUDIT SENDS SPECIAL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PROJECTS THAT COULD LAST THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS LONG AFTER THIS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE OUT OFF OUT OF OFFICE. IN ADDITION MEMBERS IT'S WORTHY TO NOTE HERE TO THAT AB TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THREE ALSO INCLUDES AN ELEMENT OF INCLUSIONARY ZONING. WHERE BEFORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND YOU DEVELOPMENT NEEDS TO BE SUBSIDIZED BY THE BUILDER? IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT A RECENT STUDY ON INCLUSIONARY ZONING SHOWED THAT ONLY ELEVEN HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WERE PRODUCED OVER THIRTY FIVE YEAR PERIOD. AND AT THAT RATE IT WOULD TAKE AT LEAST A HUNDRED YEARS TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE WERE JUST ARGUE THAT. WE LISTEN WE DO NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED TO BE BUILDING A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF NEW HOUSING YEAR WERE ONLY BUILDING HALF THAT. AGAIN THIS PROPOSAL IS INTRIGUING BUT INCLUDING AN INCLUSIONARY ZONING PIECE JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE BEST WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. THANKS. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. IT'S GOING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY COMMENTS. I WILL FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORTH THE BIG IDEA. THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AT THIS TIME DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. I THINK THIS IS A VERY INTRIGUING IDEA IT'S A NEW IDEA FOR FOR MANY OF US. AND I'LL JUST SAY CASE FOLKS ARE WONDERING OF THE AUTHOR KNIGHT HAD GOOD CONVERSATIONS AND HAD AGREED IN CONCEPT ON A NUMBER OF. POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS BUT GIVEN THAT THIS BILL WOULD OF HAD TO THREAD NOT JUSTICE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO COMMITTEE STARTING AT ONE THIRTY THIS AFTERNOON WITH. AMENDMENTS THAT. WOULD HAVE HAD MORE STAFF. WORKING THROUGH THE NIGHT AND LIKELY UNABLE TO PULL TOGETHER BY THEN. I THINK WE DECIDED TO START THE CONVERSATION ARE AND HOPEFULLY CONTINUE THIS YEAR TO POTENTIALLY. CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR WITH THE AUTHOR ALDOUS LAY OUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WERE LAID OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND. SINCE IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HAD TO ENGAGE WITH THE SPONSOR. NO I THINK FIRST OF WE ARE VERY SCARCE. PUBLIC DOLLARS TO INVEST IN HOUSING. AND. I THINK THE IDEA THAT SOME OF THESE DOLLARS MIGHT GO TO SUPPORT MARKET RATE HOUSING IT'S INTRIGUING BUT VERY MUCH A NEW CONCEPT. GIVEN HOW FEW DOLLARS WE HAVE THAT WE WOULD DEVOTE TO A AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT. THE AUTHOR AND I HAD DISCUSSED. SECONDLY THE THIRTY FIVE YEAR SUBSIDY HOW THAT. AND THE FACT THAT WE WOULD POTENTIALLY BE DOING THIS FOR THREE AND A HALF DECADES WAS ALSO A DIFFERENT ISSUE RELATED TO THAT TEN. OF LOVE TO GET SOME UNDERSTANDING OF THAT AND THEN THIRDLY. THERE ARE PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE THE SUBSIDIES WOULDN'T BE NECESSARY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO DOWNTOWN LA DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. ARE OAKLAND SAN JOSE YOU WOULDN'T NEED THE SUBSIDIES AND AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IN THE BILL AS DRAFTED THAT CREATED THAT DISTINCTION SO. UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN YOU WOULD WANT TO AND SENT HOUSING. CREATION THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE INCENTIVE FIGURED OUT THAT FINE BALANCES. IS A CONCEPT I THINK WE NEED TO TO WRAP AROUND SO IF YOU HAVE ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THAT LOVE THEM BUT OTHERWISE. OUTLOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION. ON THIS INNOVATIVE IDEA. ABSOLUTELY. AND AND ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT RIGHT NOW THOUGH AS WE GO MISTER CLARE. I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN I YOU KNOW I RECOGNIZE ROB VOTING ON THIS TODAY THIS IS A CONCEPT I THAT I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT AND I I JUST WANNA OFFER ENCOURAGEMENT ON THIS. IT WE HAVE SUCH A PROBLEM SUCH A MASSIVE SCALE AS MY COLLEAGUE POINT OUT HER COMMENTS A REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORTS SINCE NEW TOOLS ITS NEW EFFORTS. WERE PARTNERING ON AN EFFORT TO TRY AND OF EXAMINED OF REDEVELOPMENT AND AND PROVIDE ANOTHER TOOL BUT. GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE PROBLEM ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THIS IS WHAT I'M ASKED ABOUT MORE THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE IN THE STATE. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US TO TRY BUT FOR ITS NEW SOLUTIONS AGAIN ONE LIKE OUR CHAIRMAN COMMEND YOU FOR THINKING BIG AND TRY TO BRING US SOME DOES SOMETHING TO REACT TO. I'M SORRY WE CAN'T MISS A TAKE ACTION TODAY. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THIS IS SORT OF FLUSH OUR DISCUSSION I THINK THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONING. OUR THE COMMENTS IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS OR ARE ON POINT. ENCOURAGE YOU CAN HE LOOK AT THAT AND HOPEFULLY RETURN. IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE A WAS A NEW POTENTIALLY COULD VOTE ON SUGGESTS AT GAMEWORKS ENCOURAGEMENT WITH APPRECIATION OF THE AUTHOR. MR VENTURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST TO ECHO A MUCH MORE A LITTLE BIT FOR STUFF THANKS FOR THEM THE WAY YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT ON WHAT I'M INTRIGUED BY AND IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER. COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IS YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONCERNING THE QUALITY OF THE UNITS TO WHEN I WAS THAT WAS GOOD TO HEAR THAT. WOULD TIGHTEN THAT TECHNO BUILDING MORE BUT I I LIKE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT INSTEAD OF BECAUSE WE'RE BILLING SHORTER WE'RE BUILDING THE SMALLER CRAMMING PEOPLE IN THERE. YOU'RE GIVING THOUGHT TO ACTUALLY THE QUALITY OF WHAT'S BEEN CREATED TO SO I AM I DON'T THINK WE WANT THESE YOU KNOW KIND OF STARTING KANSEN IS PACKING PEOPLE INTO. VERY SMALL UNITS THAT REALLY AREN'T AS PLEASANT PLACES TO LIVE. IF WE ARE GONNA HAVE HIGHER DENSITY. THERE'S THERE'S THINGS THAT GO WITH THAT AND AND I THINK THAT ALSO S. BECAUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO WRITE WHAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THAT. ARM IN WHAT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT PARKING WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT. THESE OTHER IN A. SEWER AND WATER HOOKUPS ALL THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN IS YOU HAVE MORE UNITS IN MORE IMPACT ON AN AREA IN EVEN IN AREAS. YOU KNOW LET IT IT IN OTHER THE CHAIRMAN BROUGHT UP SAN FRANCISCO LA SAN DIEGO. SORT OF BIGGER CITIES THAT HAVE MAYBE LARGER DOWNTOWNS BUT EVEN THERE. KNOW THERE IS THERE IS EIGHT A MAXIMUM RIGHT THERE IS A TIPPING POINT THERE FOR SO CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE EVEN IN THOSE PLACES LET ALONE SMITH'S OCEAN OUR CITIES BUT I I REALLY WANNA CREDIT YOU MISS FRIEDMAN I THINK. I LIKE TO. DO THAT THAT YOU'RE TAKING ON SOMETHING THAT'S BIG BUT SECONDLY. THAT WAS JUST KIND OF UNIQUE TAG HERE AND A NUMBER OF THESE HOUSING. ITEMS WE HERE WE DON'T AND HER TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ACTUAL QUALITY OF THE UNIT ISN'T SO HATS OFF TO YOU FOR DOING THAT. THANKS. YEAH I MEAN I IF YOU DON'T MIND AUTISTIC ONE SECOND HER TO RECYCLING HOUSE WHEN ISN'T TURN IT OVER TO YOU HOWEVER YOU WANT TO RESPOND SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A AND FIRST OF ALL I REPRESENT ONE OF THE GROUND ZEROES OF THE HOUSING CRISIS BEING LOS. ANGELES. AND THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE AROUND IT. AND SEE EVERY SINGLE DAY THE IMPACT OF NOT JUST WHAT'S HAPPENED WHEN CITIES REFUSE TO BUILD BUT ALSO THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS OF POLICIES BUT THE LOCAL ON THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT THEY RESULT IN THE TYPE OF HOUSING THE RESULTS IN AND. SO IN A LOT OF WAYS I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GONE BACKWARDS WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE DOING IS LOOKING AT WHAT WE WANT WE WANT LARGER. TALLER INFILL NEAR TRANSIT IN NEAR JOBS AND A LOT OF THESE COMMUNITIES SO HOW DO WE GET THERE AND THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ACTUALLY GET US THAT TYPE OF HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING IN. A BUNCH OF STIPULATIONS AND JUST SEEING WHAT WE GET I THINK WE NEED TO WORK FROM OUTSIDE AND WORK BACKWARDS AND TO YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THESE ARE IN THE AREAS WE WANT THEM. I THINK THAT WE DO THE SAME THING WE ASK OUR MUNICIPALITIES AND WE CAN YOU KNOW TALK ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS IN THE BILL BUT WE ASK MUNICIPALITIES WHO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS THAT COULD BOOST BENEFIT FOR THIS TYPE OF GROWTH LET THE PLANNERS DO THEIR WORK WHERE THEY REALLY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THIS AND WHERE IS THE MARKET UNABLE TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING BEAT BECAUSE OF. THE THE REALITIES OF THE AREA THE FINANCING THE TYPE OF AREA THAT IT CURRENTLY IS SO THAT THEY CAN ENVISIONED A DIFFERENT FUTURE FOR THOSE TRANSIT HEAVY BUT HOUSING POOR AREAS AND IDENTIFY THOSE AND LET THIS WORK IN THOSE AREAS. BUT EXCLUDING AREAS WHERE THE MARKET HAS SHOWN THAT IT'S ALREADY ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND AT WHATEVER POINT WHERE THE MARKET TAKES OVER AND BECAUSE NOW YOU'VE CREATED A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S DESIRABLE WITH THESE PROJECTS. YOU CAN PULL THE PROJECT BACK AND LET THE FREE MARKET TAKE EFFECT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL WORK THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO GO INTO THIS BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN. YOU'RE ALL COMFORTABLE IN VOTING ON A TO MAKE EVERYBODY COMFORTABLE HAT THIS ARE PROJECTS THAT COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THIS KIND OF HELP THAT THERE ARE AREAS WHERE IT'SNECESSARY WERE. WHERE THE COMMUNITIES HAVE THE VISION TO WANT TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF HOUSING AND TO CREATE THOSE WALKABLE BIKE ALL NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE CAN? ALREADY HAVE THE TRANSIT ALREADY HAVE THE JOBS BUT I'M VERY VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS CONCEPT THIS IS A TOOL THAT I CAN IDENTIFY MANY AREAS IN MY DISTRICT IN ADJACENT TO MY DISTRICT. WHERE THIS IF THIS WERE IN PLACE WE COULD START CREATING HOUSING YOU KNOW ALMOST IMMEDIATELY SO I'M PASSIONATE NIGHT I PROMISE YOU'LL BE SEEING THIS BILL AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE? BUT I THINK THANK YOU AND AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR ON BEHALF OF UP FOR GROW THINGS OFF HER FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN AND THINK THE CHAIR. VERY VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INSIGHT AND INTO THE HOUSES ON THE ON THE BILL WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH A PROCESS OVER THE COMING MONTHS.

WHAT I THINK THAT WAS THE QUICKEST PRESENTATION TODAY'S APPRECIATE THAT FAMOUS SHARED THANK YOU MISTER GRAY MISTER MONTAGUE TO MISTER MILLER? MISTER MULLIN FILE ITEM SIX AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PRESENTING AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO. FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS ARE THE BACKBONE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE IN OUR STATE. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO GRANTS THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY TO ADJUST THE INTEREST RATE ON LOANS COUPLED WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS UTILIZING. FEDERAL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS WE NEEDED TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS FEASIBLE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS UTILIZING THESE TAX CREDITS CAN BECOME IN FEASIBLE OR AT RISK WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MUCH INTEREST ACCRUING ON LOANS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. AND OTHER PUBLIC LENDERS WHEN THESE LOANS ACCRUE MORE INTERESTING COMMITTEE ACCOMMODATED IN A PROJECTS CAPITAL ACCOUNT. THIS CAN MAKE THE PROJECT IN FEASIBLE ALTOGETHER. IN OTHER CASES AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FACE ADVERSE THREE THAT ADVERSITY WHEN IT READS SYNDICATING YES THAT IS A WORD WE SYNDICATING. A TAX CREDIT PROPERTY AND MUST MATERIALLY MODIFY AN EXISTING BELOW MARKET RATE EACH CD LOAN. FOR EXAMPLE EXTENDING THE LOAN BY MORE THAN FIVE YEARS QUALIFIES AS A MATERIAL MODIFICATION OF ALONE UNDER IRS RULES. THIS CHANGES THE TAX TREATMENT OF THE LOAN IN A WAY. WHICH THE PROJECTS ACCESS TO FOUR PERCENT TAX CREDIT EQUITY IS REDUCED IN THESE CASES S. ADJUSTMENT IS SUBSTANTIAL AND JEOPARDIZES THE PROJECT'S FEASIBILITY. WHILE H. CITY CURRENTLY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE ON SOME LOANS AND TO INCREASE THE RATE ON CERTAIN OTHERS THIS BILL WOULD GIVE AGE CD BROAD AUTHORITY TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE INTEREST RATE ON ANY HCV LOAN WHEN NEEDED. TO HELP PROJECTS PENCIL OUT. LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTING THEIR INTEREST RATES IN THE SITUATIONS FOR YEARS. AND THIS FLEXIBILITY IS NEEDED AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL. I'M VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENT NOTED ON PAGE FOUR OF THE ANALYSIS I HAVE HERE WITH ME TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THIS. IS KEVIN KNUTSON HE IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY ECONOMICS AND TOM COLLISHAW PRESIDENT CEO OF SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. AND ANSWER ANY OF YOUR HIGHLY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ON WHAT IS A HIGHLY TECHNICAL BUILT. THANK YOU MISTER IS SAYING WE SHOULD BE ASKING YOU THOSE HIGHLY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. BOB I'M SORRY WILL HAD JUST GIVING UP WITH THAT RIGHT TURN IT OVER TO SPONSOR MY HEARING IMPAIRMENT ACTUALLY COMES IN HANDY ON THESE HIGHLY TECHNICAL BILLS. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. YOUR WITNESSES. HI GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KEVIN CONNEXXION AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICANT X. SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. HE ECONOMIC HAS PROVIDED FINANCING TAX CREDIT CONSULTING SERVICES TO NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TRACK CALIFORNIA. INCLUDING THOSE USING STE HCD PROGRAMS. THIS BILL IS A VERY SHORT BILL BUT IT'S IT IS COMPLEX AND SO IF YOU'LL BEAR WITH ME FOR JUST A MINUTE. A TRY TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THESE UNDERLYING ISSUES. IN RECENT YEARS WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH A TD TO CRAFT OTHER LEGISLATION SIMILAR TO THIS TO ENABLE A CD. STAY NIMBLE AND KEEP PACE WITH A CONSTANTLY EVOLVING WORLD OF TAX CREDIT FINANCE. AND TO DO SO IN A WAY THAT LEVERAGES THE MOST PRIVATE EQUITY CAPITAL FROM LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. AND THE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE STATE'S GOALS FOR SERVING THE MODERN INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TWO WOULD ALLOW EACH CD IN ITS FIRST PART. TO REDUCE THE INTEREST RATE ON ANY OF ITS LOANS FROM THE TYPICAL THREE PERCENT SIMPLE ANNUAL INTERESTS. EFFORT BUT ACCRUING CHARGE A MOST HCD LOANS WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. IT CITY LONG PROVIDE FIFTY FIVE YEAR LOANS AT THREE PERCENT SIMPLE INTEREST WITH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS DEFERRED AT THE END OF THE TERM. IN EXCHANGE FOR RESTRICTIONS WHICH LIMIT IRAN'S TERROR LEVELS AFFORDABLE TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. THE CURRENT ANNUAL THREE PERCENT SIMPLE INTEREST ON THESE LOANS IS IN THE ANNUAL DEDUCTION. TO THE OWNERS OF THIS HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE OWNER REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PAID. OWNERS OF TAX CREDIT PROPERTIES MUST FILE WITH THE IRS EVERY YEAR AS PART OF THEIR TEN SIXTY FIVE FEDERAL TAX RETURN. AND ANNUAL ACCOUNTING OF EACH PART PARTNERS CAPITAL ACCOUNT. PUT VERY SIMPLY A CAPITAL ACCOUNT IS AN ANNUAL TALLY. OF PARTNERS CUMULATIVE EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PROJECT. REDUCED BY THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF TAX DEDUCTIONS. AND OUR CASH FLOW TAKEN FROM THE PROJECT. FOR NEARLY ALL LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROJECTS THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT STARTS VERY HIGH. AS THE TAX CREDIT INVESTOR LIMITED PARTNER MAKES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIRST YEAR TO. AND SLOPES DOWNWARD OVER TIME AS THE PARTNER TAKES INTEREST DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS. REMEMBER THAT THE ACCRUING INTEREST ON EACH CD LOAN IS INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL DEDUCTIONS REDUCES THE CAPITAL COUNTS. IN MOST THE PROJECT TO WORK ON OUR STATE CAPITOL COUNTS ARE NOT AN OBSTACLE. BUT FOR SMALL AND I WANT TO SEE A GROWING NUMBER OF PROJECTS THEY APPEAR TO BE. IF ANY POINT IN A TAX CREDIT PARTNERS CAPITAL CAN'T REACHES ZERO DURING THE FIFTEEN YEAR TAX CREDIT WE CAPTURE PERIOD. ONE OF TWO THINGS MUST GENERALLY HAPPENS. THE FIRST IS AT THE PARTNER MUST STOP TAKING ANYMORE THE PROMISED TAX CREDITS OR DEDUCTIONS. AND LESSEN UNTIL THEIR CAPITAL COUNTY COMES POSITIVE AGAIN. IF THIS OCCURS DURING ELEVEN YEAR PERIOD DURING WHICH THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT IS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED. IT'S LIKELY BE CATASTROPHIC FOR THE PROJECT. THE SECOND POSSIBILITY IS THAT THE PROJECT IS GENERATED WAS CALLED MINIMUM GAIN WHICH IS A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROJECTS TAX BASIS. AT OUTSTANDING DEBT. YOU'RE CONTINUE TAKING THE LOW INCOME HOUSING CREDITS AND DEDUCTIONS EVEN THOUGH DOING SO MAKES THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT GO NEGATIVE. NOW THE WORDS THE BENEFITS INVESTOR HAS TAKEN OUT OF THE PROJECT EXCEED WHAT THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED. THE SECOND OUTCOMES CERTAINLY BETTER THAN THE FIRST HOWEVER IT HAS ANOTHER QUITE NEGATIVE OUTCOME. BEFORE THE TAX CREDIT INVESTOR CAN EXIT THE PROJECT THE PROJECT CAN BE RETURNED TO THE SPONSOR. TAXES MUST BE PAID ON THE NEGATIVE CAPITAL ACCOUNT THE EXTRA BENEFITS. AT THE END OF FIFTEEN YEARS. WHEN THE OPERATION OF THE NONPROFIT SPONSOR TYPICALLY HAS THE OPTION TO REPURCHASE THE PROJECT FROM A TAX CREDIT PARTNERSHIP. INSECT BITE OF THE TAX CREDIT INVESTOR. THE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PAY. TAXES ON BEHALF OF A TAX CREDIT INVESTOR ON THE NEGATIVE CAPITAL COUNT. THOSE ACCOUNTS ARE GONE NEGATIVE BY TWO TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS NOT BE DIFFICULT TO SPONSOR. USUALLY NONPROFIT NONPROFIT MIGHT HAVE TO COME OUT OF POCKET I HAVE MILLION TO MILLION DOLLARS. REAL CASH TO REPURCHASE THE PROJECT IN THE TAX CODE PARTNERSHIP. OBVIOUSLY ON BOTH OF THESE OUTCOMES AS CONSULTANTS ADVOCATES WE DO OUR BEST TO STRUCTURE PROJECT TO MINIMIZE. THIS PROBLEM AND PRESERVE THE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THIS ISN'T A NEW ISSUE FOR US RESTRUCTURED HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS OVER THE YEARS. WITH GOOD SUCCESS AT AVOIDING OR LEAST MINIMIZING THESE PROBLEMS. WE DO COLLABORATE WITH MANY LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES WHO STRUCTURE UPFRONT THE TERMS OF THEIR SOFT LOANS. IN WAYS THAT MAINTAIN CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND AVOID THE PROBLEMS ARE DESCRIBED. PACIFIC LEAVE THESE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BEEN WILLING TO SET INTEREST RATE ON THEIR LOANS. AT OR NEAR ZERO PERCENT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE ANNUAL TAX DEDUCTIONS. THE PROJECT WAS TAKEN MAINTAIN THE CAPITAL COUNTS IN THE POSITIVE SIDE. THE ONLY PUBLIC FOR THE HOUSING LENDER WE WORK WITH YOU LACKS THE AUTHORITY. TO ADJUST INTEREST RATES IN THESE SITUATIONS IS A TWO CD. GIVING IT TO YOU THE AUTHORITIES ARE JUST AS INTEREST RATES ON LOANS WILL MAKE A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE FOR NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE THIS IS NOT A NEW ISSUE IT'S GREATLY EXACERBATED BY RECENT EVENTS. FIRST IS FEDERAL TAX REFORM. BY REDUCING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REDUCE THE VALUE OF OUR LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. AND THE TAX LOSSES TO INVESTORS RESULTING LOWER TAX CREDIT PRICING. LOWER PRICING MAKES CAPITAL CAMPERVANS WORSE. TAX REFORM ALSO EFFECTIVELY TOOK AWAY SEVERAL OPTIONS WE USED TO HAVE FOR SLOWING DOWN THE FLOW OF TAX BENEFITS GIVING US FEWER OPTIONS. TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. SECOND MAKE MAJOR CHANGES COST INCREASES AS YOU KNOW CONSTRUCTION COSTS IN OPERATING COSTS. CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND EXERT NEGATIVE PRESSURE AND CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. HIGHER COSTS MEANS DEVELOPERS ALSO GENERALLY A BIGGER FUNDING GAPS WHICH MEANS WE NEED MORE MONEY FROM EIGHT CD. MORE MONEY FOR MAKE CITY OUGHT THREE PERCENT OCCURRING INTEREST. ALSO HURTS THE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS. ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT POST TAX REFORM ENVIRONMENT OUR OFFICE TO SING A NUMBER OF PROPOSED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. WHICH DESPITE HAVING FINANCING COMMITMENTS IN HAND SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL THE COSTS. OR SIMPLY INFEASIBLE ATTACKS BASIS. DUE TO CAPITAL COUNTY ISSUES. IN SOME CASES PROJECTS CAN BE MADE FEASIBLE ON A TAX BASIS BUT THE FIX A SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PRIVATE TAX TAX CREDIT LEVERAGE EQUITY THEY CAN RAISE. RESULTING IN A BIGGER GAP IN THE NEED FOR MORE STATE OR LOCAL PUBLIC SUBSIDY. AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY ONSITE SECOND PART AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY TO MAKE IT ASK YOU TO WRAP IT UP. OKAY YOU'RE ABLE TO LOCATE WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF ITEMS LAKE WOULD CERTAINLY HELP US UPDATE TO. IT TO THE HOME PROGRAMS AND WORK IN TODAY'S FINANCIAL MARKETS WHICH IS A SPORT BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. I'M TOM COLLEGE SHOWED PRESIDENT CEO OF SELF HELP ENTERPRISES WERENONPROFIT SERVING THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY DOING HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT FOR FARMWORKERS AND OTHER. WORKING FAMILIES AND WE EXPERIENCED THAT THIS PROBLEM FIRST HAND LAST YEAR WE HAD ACTUALLY TWO PROJECTS IN. TULARE COUNTY. WILL BOTH SUPPORTED BY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES ONE GOT HELD UP BECAUSE OF THIS VERY PROBLEM SO IT IS A VERY REAL PROBLEM. WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EFFORT TO CREATE MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR H. CD TO BE ABLE TO FIX. THESE THINGS UNDER A NUFF BARRIERS AND CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITHOUT TO. ADDING ADDING THIS BARRIER WITH THAT FOR INVESTORS THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS. REBEKAH MARCUS REPRESENTING LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT.

ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER CHAU. I JUST WANTED TO GET THE SIMPLIFICATION SO SO THIS BILL ALLOWS SOCIAL ALLOW HCV TO SET THE YEAR OF THE INTEREST RATE. SO WOULD THE POINT FOUR FOUR TWO AS THE DID THE FLOOR IS THAT IS IS THAT WHAT IT IS OR. HOW WE GIVING THEM ARE COMPLETE DISCRETION AND IF SO THEN OF IF OF FOUR POINT TWO FOUR POINT TWO PERCENT IS TO THE FLOOR THEN? WHAT IS SO MAGICAL ABOUT DATA I DIDN'T QUITE FOLLOW THAT EXPLANATION? THAT THE IDEA IS TO GET THE FLOOR WOULD BE POINT FOUR POINT FOUR TWO PERCENT THAT'S I FIGURE THAT'S ESTABLISHED BY EIGHT CD THAT'S REPRESENT OF THEIR. ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE LONG. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY BACK TO THE AUTHOR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ENTERTAINING THE BILL. WERE WORKING WITH HCV GOING FORWARD ABOUT ADDITIONAL AYE ISSUES WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF FIRST LET ME JUST THINK. BICU OR CONSULTANT TEAM AND YOURSELF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WE REALLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEM. AND THEIR. THEIR SIGNIFICANT HELP ON THIS LEGISLATION ABOUT THE BILL'S BEEN DOUBLE REFER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE LATER THIS AFTERNOON SO PROCEDURALLY. I CANNOT ADOPT ANY AMENDMENTS IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE NEXT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT ADDRESSED ISSUES REYES IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND APPRECIATE BOTH CONSULTANTS FOR WORKING. TOGETHER ON THIS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GONNA FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE PROVISIONS THAT REFLECT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. I'M SO THE BILL REMOVES BARRIERS TO WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF EIGHTY USES LOW COST ENERGY EFFICIENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. ACCEPTS RING DWELLING UNITS IN JUNIOR EXCEPT FOR DAHLE UNITS ARE KEY TO HELP SOLVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS THESE UNITS CAN BE BUILT FAIRLY QUICKLY AND AT A FAIRLY. AT A SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER I RATE THE NEW CONSTRUCTION A FACT A STUDY FROM THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION. DOCUMENTED THAT DESPITE NUMEROUS EIGHTY YOU LOTS BEING ENACTED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. UNFORCED IN MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES CONTINUE TO IMPOSE BARRIERS TO I EIGHTY USE. FOR EXAMPLE ARTESIA HAS A LOCAL ORDINANCE NOW THAT ONLY ALLOWS LOTS THAT ARE TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR GREATER TO BUILD IN EIGHTY YOU. WHICH EFFECTIVELY ADVANCE THEM I THIS IS. AS YOU KNOW THE REASON THAT WE ARE ALL BECOMING MUCH MORE HEAVILY INVOLVED THE STATE LEVEL YOURSELF THIS COMMITTEE. ON MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES ARE ARE FOCUSED ON LAWS THAT WILL HELP STREAMLINED THE CONSTRUCTION OF HOUSING. I'M PROUD TO. TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SUCCESSES THANKS TO GET OUR CHAIR AND HIS LEADERSHIP DURING HIS TIME ON THE BOARD OF CITY COUNCIL FRANCISCO. OUR APPLICATION TO SAN FRANCISCO OR UP FROM FORTY ONE AND TWENTY FIFTEEN TO ONE THOUSAND FORTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SETS A NUMBER COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA ALSO ENCOURAGING THE BUILDINGS OF EIGHTY USE IN JUNIOR EIGHTY YEARS UP WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B.. TWENTY EIGHT NINETY AND I HAVE FOR THE TWO WITNESSES. YOUR WITNESSES MISSPENT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DENISE PING STAN I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY. CURRENT GO LOCAL ZONING BOARD ADMINISTRATOR OF MEMBER A FORMER CURRENT PLANNING CHIEF AND A MEMBER ABOUT A DOZEN HOUSING COMMITTEE SAID THE BAY AREA. AS A VOLUNTEER. AND THE FOLKS WHO WERE IN THE EIGHTY YOU ADVOCACY GROUP IN CALIFORNIA ARE ALL VOLUNTEERING OUR TIME BECAUSE THERE IS NO PAID LOBBYIST YOU CAN COME HERE AND REPRESENT HOMEOWNERS. WHO TAKE THEIR BUILDING PERMIT TO THE COUNTER AND TRY TO GET IT APPROVED TO ADD A HOUSE OR AT HOMES IT OUT WITHIN THEIR BUILDING ENVELOPE TO HOUSE PEOPLE WHO WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING AND HOUSE THAT MAYBE US OVER SERVING THEM? THIS BILL WAS DRAFTED BY EXPERTS AT UCLA'S CITY ALLOWED. WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON EIGHTY YOU POLICY FOR A DECADE IN LOS ANGELES AND WHO OF DIRECTLY WITNESSED A CONTINUING BARRIERS THAT REMAIN TO ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA? I'M HERE TODAY WITH ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES AT THE TURNER CENTER AT UC BERKELEY WHO AGAIN HAS BEEN STUDYING THE EFFECT OF CALIFORNIA'S RECENT EIGHTY YOU LAWS. AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME VERY ENCOURAGING OUTCOMES IT'S ALSO QUITE CLEAR THAT WE WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE DONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO. THERE WERE JUST BERRIES THAT WERE UNFORESEEABLE VENDOR THAT WE DIDN'T SEE AND SO THIS SET OF PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THESE THIS BILL. TAKES CARE OF THE REMAINING ZONING BARRIERS THAT CONTINUE TO PREVENT HOMEOWNERS FROM PULLING THAT BUILDING PERMIT WHEN THEY GO TO THE ZONING COUNTER IN SPITE OF STATE LAW THAT SAYS CITY SHOULD ISSUE MINISTERIAL PERMITS FOR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. DID THE BILL REMOVES MAJOR BARRIERS THAT CONTINUE IN COMMUNITIES INCLUDING LARGE MINIMUM LOT SIZES ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING POINTED OUT. A PARKING RESTRICTIONS IF YOU IF YOU PULL IT I'M. AND. FEES AND CODES WHICH I UNDERSTAND ARE BEING REMOVED FROM THE BILL. THE BILL ALSO HAS GOT PROVISIONS IN IT THAT WERE DRAFTED BY PLANNERS IN THE FIRE RECOVERY ZONES IN THE NORTH COUNTY WHO HAVE IDENTIFIED EIGHTY USE AS THE ONLY FEASIBLE MEANS OF PROVIDING HOUSING QUICKLY. IN RESPONSE TO THE MAJOR CATASTROPHIC FIRES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS FACED AND WHO THEMSELVES REVIEWED EARLY DRAFTS OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT INCLUDED ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT WERE NECESSARY. FOR NOT ONLY THE KEEP THE FIRE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE HOUSING QUICKLY BUT FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO EQUALLY SHARE. THE PROVISION OF HOUSING TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME CITIES THAT ARE STELLAR ACTORS INNER I ADOPTING REALLY GOOD BEST PRACTICES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO. THAT IS ADOPTING MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS IN THE BUILDING ENVELOPE THAT MIGHT HAVE A BASEMENT OR SOMEONE YOU SPACE AND LETTING EIGHTY USE BE BUILT AND THEIR. MOTHER SOME REALLY GOOD GOOD ACTORS THERE'S A LOT OF CITIES THAT ARE STILL TRYING TO AVOID COMPLYING WITH STATE LAW AND AS IT RELATES TO EIGHTY USE. SO THIS BILL. BY REMOVING THOSE REMAINING ZONING BARRIERS ALLOWS HOMEOWNERS TO BUILD SAFE LEGAL BUILDING PERMITTED HOUSING. ON THEIR PROPERTY AND AND TO GET YES WITH THE CITY WHEN THEY SHOW UP WITH THAT BUILDING PERMIT APPLICATION AND SAID ARE BEING TOLD. THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T GET IN A BUILDING PERMIT BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET A MINIMUM LOT SIZE OR SOME OTHER STANDARD THAT FRANKLY CITY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO ELIMINATE. THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS. A GOOD MORNING AND I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING ENDEAVORS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA. I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR AT THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AND TO DATE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ON ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS. AND BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL AND AND SEVERAL OF OUR EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATIONS TO. INCREASE THE PRODUCTION OF EXCESS WRIGGLING UNITS TO THE TURNER CENTER CONSIDERS EIGHTY USED TO BE IN A SOCIAL A PIECE OF A BROADER. A SOLUTION TO THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS OZZIE'S UNITS REPRESENT A PARTICULARLY EFFICIENT AND AFFORDABLE A FORM OF HOUSING AND SPECIFICALLY EIGHTY USE REQUIRE NO SUBSIDY. ARE GENERALLY RENDER THAT BELOW MARKET RATE ANTS INDIVIDUALS WHO OFTENTIMES HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WITH THE OWNER SUCH AS A FAMILY MEMBER OR CARETAKER. AND MORE OVER. EIGHTY USE CAN INCREASE HOUSING OPTION USING AREAS WERE LARGER SCALE DEVELOPMENT IS NOT PHYSICAL FEASIBLE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT. MAJORITY OF THE STATE IS. ZONE FOR SINGLE FAMILY DETACHED HOUSING SO GIVEN THESE BENEFITS TERMS CENTER BELIEVES THAT REMOVING BARRIERS TO THE VELVET EIGHTY YOU SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. AND THIS BILL THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS TO ACHIEVE HIS GOALS ARE WORK HAS SHOWN SCALING BACK OWNERS DESIGN REQUIREMENTS. WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE INTEREST AND PRODUCTION IN THIS FORM OF HOUSING OUT MORE OVER THE CREATION OF A SPECIFIC SMALL STRUCTURES BUILDING CODE. SHE ALSO MEANINGFULLY REDUCE THE COST AND COMPLEXITY OF EIGHTY USE AND AS WE SEE WITH OTHER RECENT LEGISLATION ELIMINATING OBSTACLES. FOR HOMEOWNERS INTERESTED IN EIGHTY USE IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO CREATE MORE. INTEREST IN IN HOUSING. AND TO ALSO OF GREAT UNITS THAT ARE CURRENTLY. BUILT ILLEGALLY. SO THIS SERVICE BECAUSE POTENTIAL TO CONTINUE MOMENTUM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT LEGISLATION AND THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT REFLECTS SEVERAL OF OUR EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS. I SHOULD MENTION WE BROUGHT WITH US TODAY SOMEONE YOU ACTUALLY IS HELPING HOMEOWNERS BUILD EIGHTY USER TRYING TO JOE SERRANO THE CBO TENT MAKERS. WHO'S BEEN ACTIVE PARTICULARLY AND LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THE BAY AREA TO HELP HOMEOWNERS WHO NEED AN EIGHTY YOU TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE OR ANOTHER WHY STAY IN THEIR HOME. AND TO LEGALIZE EXISTING ILLEGALLY SO HE'S HERE IF YOU WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF HIM GREAT THANK YOU WELCOME. ARE THERE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING DEBORAH CARL'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. PARANORMAL REPRESENTING BRIDGE HOUSING ALSO IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL AIM AT THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. SO SEND MATT NOT LIGHTHOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS HERE ON BEHALF OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY CALIFORNIANS FOR THE BILL. LOSE MONDAY FOR CALIFORNIA MEANS FOR THE BILL. I'M AB VETERANS YEAH I WAS WORKING PARTNERSHIPS USA REPRESENTING A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY ARE ALONG WITH AYE AYE YIN AYE UNITE HERE LOCAL MAIN SEEM AN ABC LOCAL SEVEN. I IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS AMENDED TO RESTRICT SHORT TERM RENTALS THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. A GOOD MORNING I AM MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF THE COW FREE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED PURPOSE A POSITION ON THE BILL ON AND AS I UNDERSTAND. I'M FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAFF AND AND AS INDICATED BY THE AUTHOR. AND AMENDMENTS TO BE TAKEN IN THE COMMITTEE I IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE WILL PRESERVE. MUNICIPAL UTILITIES RIGHT ABILITY TO COLLECT FEES FOR SERVICES THEY'RE PROVIDING INTERNET FOR FOR WATER IF WATER ELECTRICITY HOOKUPS AND SO WHEN THAT MEN INSIDE TAKEN WILL REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANKS. THANK YOU WHAT WE HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS NANCY CHINA'S HAS BEEN US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS OVER A THOUSAND SCHOOL BOARDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT OUR COMMENTS TO THE FEE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AND A BUT FIRST OFF I WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE BROADER GOALS OF THE BILL AND I AGREE WITH PROPONENTS THAT EIGHTY USE ARE THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF. RESOLVING THE HOUSING CRISIS. WE IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY LIVE THE HOUSING CRISIS EVERY DAY WE KNOW DEFECTS OUR STUDENTS AND POSE A SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES TO US FOR RECRUITMENT RETENTION OF STAFF. THAT SAID. EXACERBATING THE CRISIS OF SCHOOL FACILITIES IS NOT THE ANSWER SO WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. FIRST YES SIR. UP FIRST OFF I WNT TO MENTION THAT PROP FIFTY ONE WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN ACTUALLY PROHIBITS THE. THE AMENDMENT THAT EXCUSE ME IT LOCKED IN THE GOVERNMENT FEET THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THAT AUTHORIZES LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO ASSESS DEVELOPMENT FEES IT PROPOSES CAPS AND IT REQUIRES JUSTIFICATION STUDIES. AND THAT CAN ONLY BE AMENDED BY AN ACT OF THE VOTERS. AND ALSO I WANT TO SAY THAT. THE OVERCROWDING. THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING IN THE GROWTH THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING WE STILL HAVEN'T CAUGHT UP FROM THE TWO THOUSAND HOUSING BOOM THESE NEED THESE FUNDS ARE ARE VERY MUCH NEEDED. THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO RAISE OUR OUR IMPACT FEES OR TO QUALIFY FOR STATE UNDING WHICH IS VERY MUCH LACKING. AND. I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT. WE ALSO THINK WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND NINE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STUDY WHICH WILL SHED SOME MORE LIGHT ON HOW IMPACT FEES. ARE WORKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND. DISPEL THE MYTH THAT PEOPLE WHO LIVE AN ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN BECAUSE WE KNOW FROM OUR DAILY INTERACTION WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE AND ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE ARE FINE. HOUSING FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW THE. AND IF I COULD JUST TO THE AUTHOR I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WILL BE TAKEN THE FEES SECTION OUT WORK IN IRAQ THAT ACCIDENT YET JUST A GREATER CLARIFY. ON CLIMATE AND MOST THE OPPONENTS HERE AROUND THE FEE PROVISIONAL WE ARE STRIKING. THE FREE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL OUT I APPRECIATE THAT IT WASN'T CLEAR TO US THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU. I THINK WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT BE AMENDMENT AND IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE THERE'S TWO OTHER BILLS AMENDING THE SAME SECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE RIGHT NOW ON THIS ON TOPIC. I DID JUST BECAUSE WHEN THE HOUSING AT UNIVAR MAKE COMMITTEE WANNA POINT OUT THAT OFTEN WHEN LOCAL AGENCIES DE FOR OR WAVE IMPACT FEES WERE GETTING SOME LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY AND I THINK THAT'S A CONCEPT THAT HASN'T REALLY BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT. OF EIGHTY USE AND I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LAND USE RELATED PROVISIONS IN THE BILL AS EVERYONE KNOWS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE PASSED TWO MAJOR LAWS OVERHAULING EXCESS REDRAWING UNIT LAW. IT'S JUST BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JUNE I'M SORRY JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOW AT THE TAIL END OF UPDATING THEIR ORDINANCES AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN. REWRITING THE CODE IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY I'M I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPACT SPECIFICALLY ON COUNTIES WHERE I THINK SOME OF THIS BILL. IS REALLY FOCUSED ON URBAN AREAS AND NOT THE UNINCORPORATED AREAS WHERE THERE MIGHT BE REASONS FOR A SORT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS THAT. THE SIZE OF THESE UNITS IN UNINCORPORATED AREAS IS GONNA TEND TO BE MUCH LARGER AND SO THE IMPACTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BE GREATER FOR INSTANCE PLASTER COUNTY RIGHT UP THE HILL FROM US. ALLOWS TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF EXCESS THREE RESIDENTIAL USES SO THAT COULD INCLUDING EIGHTY YOU ARE GARAGE AT CETERA AND THAT'S THE MINIMUM SIZE ALLOWED. IT GOES ALL THE WAY UP TO NO RESTRICTIONS ON SIZE FOR ACCESSORY RESIDENTIAL USES IF YOU HAVE A LARGER PARCEL. ONE OTHER ISSUE FOR US IN TERMS OF THE LIMITATIONS ON RESTRICTIONS ON PARCEL SIZE IS AN UNINCORPORATED AREAS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PLACES THAT DON'T HAVE SEWER AND WATER SERVICE. SO BY JUST STRIKING THE ABILITY TO USE PARCEL SIZE IS A SCREENING CRITERIA FOR WHETHER AND EIGHTY YOU CAN STATE ON A PARCEL OR NOT. YOU'RE GOING TO FORCE PEOPLE INTO A SITUATION WHERE THEY GET ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THEN WHEN THEY GO TO TRY TO PULL THEIR WELL OR SEPTIC PERMIT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE UNIT APPROVED SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S A POLICY OUTCOME THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. FINALLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE'S A VERY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO REQUIRE INSTEAD OF AS THE TWENTY SIXTEEN LIES DEAD. TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS WHERE EIGHTY USE ARE PERMITTED THE LAW WOULD NOW CHANGED TO REQUIRE THE OPPOSITE SO BASICALLY THE ORDINANCE WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY RE WRITTEN TO SAY WHERE THEY ARE EXCLUDED AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD SEEK TO LIMIT THE ABILITY TO PRECLUDE EIGHTY USE IN AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY OR OTHER ISSUES LIKE THAT BY IMPOSING A STANDARD. THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER PARTS OF LAND USE LAW WHICH IS THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE VERSUS THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE STANDARD SERVER THESE REASONS AND MANY MORE OUTLINES ARE LETTERS AYE WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHER OPPOSITION YESTERDAY MORNING THAT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JASON RYAN LEE CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO EIGHTY USE I MEAN THAT'S EXISTING LAW AND WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE CONCERNS. WHETHER COLLEAGUES OVERSEE SACK. FAIR I JUST WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION SCHOOL BUSINESS OFFICIALS AND CONTINUES OPPOSITION. FOR HIM TO DEAL WITH THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING CONTINUED OPPOSITION. JOHN OF COURSE ABOUT THE URBAN KINDS OF CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. TRACY RAN ROLL COUNTY REPRESENTS A CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. OR ENABLE NC REPRESENT THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION JUST ONE AT THAT WE WERE ACTUALLY JUST AN US SENATE GOVERNANCE OF FINANCE FOR A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN ON. ONE OF THE TWO BILLS UP SO WE ARE CONCERNED WE APPRECIATE YOUR AMENDMENTS HOW THESE BILLS ARE GOING TO INTERACT AS A CONTINUE TO MALES. I THINK YOU BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. WAS A MONTH SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. WITH THE STRIKING OF THE FEE PROVISION AND HOW WILL THAT. IMPACT THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

THE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STAFF THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM BEING PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS THEY. FURTHER WORK ON THIS FEE PROVISION ISSUE RIGHT THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING THAT ONLY BECAUSE. VERY OFTEN THIS IS ONE OF THE ELEMENTS THAT DOESN'T GET CONSIDERED AN AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. AT LEAST IN THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT THERE'S DEFINITELY CHILDREN LIVING AND SOME OF THESE UNITS. AND SO THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL SO THINK YOU. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION. ME JUST SAY TO US TO THE AUTHOR AS YOU KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS. THESE EIGHTY USE AND MAKING SURE WE CAN. TRADE AS MANY THEM AS POSSIBLE IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND I APPRECIATE TO YOU TRY TO TAKE ON THIS TASK OF HELPING TO REWRITE THE CODE THAT. IS CURRENTLY. HAS A LOT OF CONFUSION TO IT TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE. ARE SAN FRANCISCO EXPERIENCES YOU KNOW WE HAD A MANY DECADES DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER LEGALIZING LAWS. ME SIX YEARS TO PASS A LOCAL ORDINANCE TO DO THAT. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME HEADWAY BUT NOW THERE'S DISCUSSION NOW THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS HOW IMPORTANT EIGHTY USE OUR. THERE'S DISCUSSION OF HOW WE CLEAN UP THE LEGISLATION I ROLL LOCALLY TO DO THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL. OF THE ONLY THING I VAST AND I WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS THAT YOU AND YOUR SENATE AUTHORS ARE ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE HOPEFULLY. WE'VE CERTAINLY RELATE THAT TO OUR COUNTERPARTS IN VERY MUCH HOPE THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO A GOOD PLACE AND. AGREED TO A REALLY A ONE. ONE SET OF UP PROVISIONS THAT HELP TO. GIVE US A CLEAR SENSE OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO ON EIGHTY USE BUT GIVEN THAT. WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU AGREE TO TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. I'M HAPPY TO.

A UNIFIED APPROACH ABSOLUTELY AND I WOULD JUST SAY GOOD LUCK. I HAD WITH THAT EASIER SAID THAN DONE HERE WITH THAT. IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MOVED BY MISTER CHALLEN THINK SECONDED BY MISTER GLORIA. IT DOESN'T OTHER FEET WELL WON'T HAVE THE FEE PROVISIONS AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT THAT IS MAKING. I TOOK OUT THE FEE PROVISION. WITH THAT. MADAM SECRETARY THE ROLE. CHU I'D I MAIENSCHEIN. MAIN CHIANG NO CHILD. CHAO AYE CHOI. CHOI AYE. GLORIA AYE GLORIA AYE LEE MONTH. WE MONTH I WOULD. WHAT I? YOUR BILLS OUT LIKE YOU THANK YOU. MISTER EDUARDO GARCIA FILE ITEM ONE AB TWENTY FIVE. SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. IT WAS CHAIR COLLEAGUES. IT'S REPRESENTS YOU AB TWENTY FIFTY SIX OUR MOBILE HOME PARK REHABILITATION BILL. THAT AIMS PRIMARILY TO ALLOW PARTICULAR LOAN FUNDS TO BE USED FOR WE HAVE IRRITATION A MOBILE HOME PARKS. BEGINNING NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THE MOBILE HOME PARK REHABILITATION RESIDENT OWNERSHIP FUND WAS CREATED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE LOANS TO ASSIST WITH. CONVERSION OF SIX SIX MOBILE HOME PARKS TO BE OWNED BY ITS RESIDENTS. HOWEVER THE FUND HAS BEEN UNDER UTILIZED IN JANUARY TOSSING SEEM. THE MOST RECENT NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR PROGRAMS ALTERED IN ZERO APPLICATIONS RECEIVED. A BECAUSE OF THIS WE PROPOSE A FEW CHANGES THAT WILL SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE THE ABILITY FOR PARK CONVERSIONS TO OCCUR. THE BILL FOCUSES IN ON TWO THINGS IT ALLOWS DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT TO MAKE LOANS IN ORDER REHABILITATED MOBILE HOME PARK. PROVIDED THAT NO LESS THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THE RESIDENTS ARE LOW INCOME. IN ALSO REQUIRES THE PROGRAM LOANS. MUST SUPPORT IN ACQUISITION REHABILITATION THAT A CD DETERMINES WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFIT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOMEOWNERS. AND THAT RENT WILL REMAIN AT AN AFFORDABLE LEVEL. MEMBERS OF PARTING OR EVEN REHABILITATE OUR MOBILE PARKS CAN BE EXPENSIVE COMPLEX AND BURN SOME. HIS BILL HOPES TO MAKE A SERIES OF CHANGES THAT WILL LESSEN THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR THESE RESIDENTS WHILE ALLOWING THESE FUNDS TO GO TOWARDS REHABILITATING HIS MOBILE PARKS. AND IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE TODAY PROTEST WARNING OF BUYING ACOSTA AND INFERIOR FOR FROM THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE CORPORATION FUND. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS BY A GUEST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR RURAL HOUSING CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. JUST BRIEFLY AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID WE HAVE THIS SURPLUS AND IMPROPER FUND. WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF WORK IN RECENT YEARS AGO. DO TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT MORE USABLE. WE THINK THIS BILL ADDS TO. TO THAT IN A WAY THAT WILL I THINK. IN A FINALLY TIP THAT BALANCE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING. TO AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE. ATTEMPTED ACCESS THE PROGRAM. AND LOOKED AT. ACQUIRING A PARK AND GOT AS FAR AS REALLY PLANET TRYING TO. RUN THE NUMBERS AND PUT ME DOWN PROPOSAL TOGETHER. AND ONE OF THE CHIEF IMPROVEMENTS OF THIS BILL ARE IS ALL IT WAS ALSO HAS BEEN IMPEDIMENT WHICH IS HOW DO YOU MAKE THESE PROJECTS PENCIL IN A WAY. THAT PRESERVES THE AFFORDABLE RENTS. IN ADDITION WE SEE A NEED TO HAVE FUNDING THAT WILL ASSIST IN THE REHABILITATION OF PARKS EVEN IF THEY AREN'T REQUIRED WITH IMPROPER FUNDS. THIS BILL DOES THOSE TWO THINGS AND UP. WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE PRESERVATION OF EXISTING MOBILE HOME PARKS FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD ASK WHEN I VOTE. I DAY FERRIER I'M THE HOUSING DIRECTOR FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES ASSISTANCE CORPORATION THE LAST TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THAT LAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS I WAS THE DIRECTORATE CHIP. A COMMUNITY HOUSING IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS A NONPROFIT DEVELOPER BASED IN CHICO WOULD DEVELOPED OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THE. OF SACRAMENTO VALLEY. SO. MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE DEATHLY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INVENTORY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND SO IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT THAT WE. BOTH PRESERVE AND IMPROVE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND. ONE OF THE MECHANISMS FOR A PRETTY MUCH EVERY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM IS DEFERRED PAYMENT FINANCING WHICH. IS A WAY OF SUBSIDIZING SIMPLE OF ELEGANT WAY OF FINANCING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND OF THIS PROGRAM HAS NOT HAD THAT ACCESS TO THOSE THAT THAT TERM MOVE OF FINANCING AND SO. MANY RIGHT RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS SINGLE FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS HAVE OF SUCH LIES FINANCING THROUGH A DEFERRED PAYMENT LOANS. MORTGAGE SUBSIDY ALLOWANCES THAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USE THOSE SO I WOULD URGE YOU TO TO PASS THIS BILL AND IN SUPPORT THAT FINANCING. THANK YOU ARE THE SUPPORTERS.

CHOW AYE CHOI. SHOWING NO GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LAMONT. THE MONTH I WOULD. YOU BILLS UP WILL TAKE LEAVE IT OPEN FOR OTHER AUTHORS. OUR SECOND LAST BILL TODAY IS BY MISTER BLOOM. FILE ITEM FIVE A. B. TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS REALLY PERMITTED. PLEASE. THANK YOU AND AND GOOD MORNING THE ALICE ACT TO WAS CREATED TO MANY YEARS AGO IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. I HARDLY REMEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE MYSELF. BUT IT WAS CREATED TO ADDRESS A VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE AND RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO ALL TENANTS IN THE BUILDING. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT. HOWEVER OVER THE YEARS SOME LANDLORDS HAVE EXPLOITED THE ACT AND USE IT AS A TOOL TO AVOID COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL RENT CONTROL LAWS. THE ELLIS ACT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITS WITHDRAWING LESS THAN ALL THE UNITS IN THE BUILDING FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. AND THE LAW INDICATES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CALCULATING RENTAL AMOUNTS WHEN UNITS. ARE RE OFFERED FOR RENT THIS ALL GETS VERY TECHNICAL BUT THERE IS ALSO LANGUAGE GOVERNING THE TENTH LEAST TERMINATION DATE. THAT SOME LANDLORDS HAVE INTERPRETED AS ALLOWING MULTIPLE WITHDRAWAL DATES IN ADDITION THERE IS NO PROVISION THAT SPECIFIES THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE DAY. THAT APPLIES IF THE PROPERTY IS PUT BACK ON THE RENTAL MARKET. SOMETHING THAT WAS INTENDED BY THE ORIGINAL LAW. SOME LANDLORDS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THIS CONFUSION BY REMOVING UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. AND RETURNING THEM IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION AS UNCONTROLLED UNITS TO AVOID THE ACT'S RESTRICTIONS AND EVADE RENT CONTROL GOING FORWARD. SOME OF APPLY DIFFERENT WITHDRAWAL DATES TO DIFFERENT UNITS AND CLAIMED THAT RETURNING ONE UNIT TO THE MARKET. DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE LANDLORD TO RE OFFER ANY OTHER UNITS TO FORMER TENANTS AGAIN AS THE ACTOR OF OF OF REQUIRES. THIS ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW LESS THAN ALL OF THE UNITS FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. AND IN EFFECT NEVER ACTUALLY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET AT ALL. OF WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THREE OF THE ALICE ACT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SUCCESSFULLY AFFECTING OUR AFFECTING ALL OF THE. EXISTING TENETS AND INCREASING THE ROUTES TO MARKET. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY AMONG OTHER THINGS CLARIFYING THAT THERE IS ONE EXIT DATE AND BY ENHANCING FINES FOR VIOLATIONS IN MY WITNESSES CAN GO INTO. GREATER DETAIL OF ABOUT WHAT THESE CLARIFICATIONS ARE AND HOW THEY WILL. EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THINGS MOVING FORWARD. I'VE HAD PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS WITH CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND HAVE LISTENED CLOSELY TO THE COMMENTS THAT MANY OF YOU YOUR STAFFS AND COMMITTEE STAFF HAS PROVIDED AND. BASED ON THAT INPUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS THAT I WILL BE TAKING IN THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT. THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE PARTICULARLY WITH THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. OF HOW FOR A. CONTINUED UP UNTIL THE CURRENT MOMENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE. DISCUSSIONS GOING FORWARD. AS NEEDED. I END AND TO WILL NEGOTIATE TO AS MANY POINTS AS POSSIBLE GOING FORWARD BUT I THINK THAT WE HAVE REACHED A A VERY IMPORTANT. POINT IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS AND WE'VE AGREED TO DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS A EXTEND THE FOR THE A TWO YEAR TIME PERIOD TO FIVE YEARS AND LEAVE ALL OTHER TIME PERIODS. AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY. ELIMINATE THE CAP ON PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THE ACTOR. WHO WE WILL PROHIBIT PIECEMEAL RETURN TO THE RENTAL MARKET BY CREATING ONE EXIT DAY? AND CLARIFY THAT THE CHANGES TO THE LAW IN THIS BILL ARE ALL PROSPECTIVE AND NOT RETROACTIVE IN ADDITION. WE'RE GONNA BE DELETING PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT RELATE TO AS I MENTIONED EXTENDING THE FIVE YEAR TIME PERIOD. TO TEN YEARS. WILL DELETE THE A PROVISION THAT APPLIED TO LAST LAW FOR RENT TWO VACANT UNITS AND EXTEND. OF THE. NOTICES THERE WAS PROVISION EXTENDING NOTICES FROM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS TO ONE YEAR. AND TO WE ARE GOING TO DELETE THAT PROVISION. AND SO I I COME TO YOU SAYING THAT I THINK WE'VE DONE WHAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED OF. OF OF MYSELF AND AND THE ADVOCATES AND IT WAS TO TRY AND REACH A COMPROMISE AND I'M. COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND WITH APPLICANTS ON ALL SIDES OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. A IF AS I HOPE THE BILL MOVES FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE I HAVE WITH ME OUT AT TWO WITNESSES HERE. A TODAY ALISON REGAN WITH THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD AND BRIAN ACOSTA WHO IS REPRESENTING THE SANTA MONICA RENT CONTROL BOARD. WHAT IS AND IS NOW DECIDING WHO'S GOING TO GO AND? I THINK A MINUTE OFFERS ARE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS BRIAN AUGUSTA ON BEHALF OF THE TEN MARK WENT ABOARD AND ALSO. CALVET RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION BOTH IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. YEAH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BILL AND SO I DO I DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHAT MISTER BLOOM JUST EMPHASIZED. ABOUT THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE AGREEING TO I'M HOPEFULLY COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. BECAUSE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN WHEN THE LANDLORDS AND REAL ESTATE COMMUNITY CAME TO THIS LEGISLATURE. THEN THEY SAID WITH THE ALICE ACT ITEM WE NEED RELIEF WE NEED PROTECTION. FROM. I OF LOCAL ORDINANCE AT THAT WE PERCEIVE MAY. FORCE US TO REMAIN IN THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS AND WE NEED REALLY FROM THIS NASH CASE THAT WE THINK WILL MAKE A STATE AND AROUND HOUSING BUSINESS AND IN THAT RESPECT. THE ELLIS ACT WAS A SHIELD A SHIELD. FOR LANDLORDS TO. WHO MAY AS I SAY BE FORCED TO STAY IN THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS TO DO? THE OPERATION OF THE LOCAL ORDINANCES WAS A SHIELD NOW MANY YEARS LATER. EMPHATICALLY WITH THE ADDITION OF COSTA HAWKINS. TO OUR SET OF LAWS REGULATING LOCAL RENT CONTROL AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE ARE SEEING A DIFFERENT TREND AND THAT TREND IS THAT THE SHIELD HAS BEEN TURNED IN SOME CASES INTO A SWORD. A SWORD THAT CAN BE USED TO EVADE. A CLEAR REQUIREMENTS OF THE LOCAL ORDINANCE WITH RESPECT TO BOTH GOOD BECAUSE REQUIREMENTS AND INSURING. BOTTOM THE PRESERVATION OF RENT CONTROL UNITS AND SO THAT PARTICULAR WITH THESE AMENDMENTS TODAY IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IT'S ABOUT. IF YOU AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THE ALICE ACT WHICH IS THE HOT. IT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR A CLAMOR TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS. NOTHING WE'RE DOING IN THIS BILL AFFECTS ANY LANDLORD DESIRING TO DO THAT BUT WHAT WE ARE. ATTEMPTING TO DO HERE IS TIGHTEN UP THE RULES FOR THOSE ARE USING ALICE ACT. IN IN A WAY THAT IT'S GAMESMANSHIP TO AVOID THE APPLICATION OF THE LOCAL ORDINANCE AND. AND IN SO DOING WE ARE I THINK CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE ACT. UPDATING IT IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE ARE SEEING AS ARE THE TRENDS BY SOME UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WHO WERE USING ALICE ACT NO WAY THAT WAS NEVER INTENDED. I THINK WITH THE AMENDMENTS TODAY AND WITH THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH CA WE HAVE A BILL THAT'S VERY NARROWLY TAILORED TO THAT OBJECTIVE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE AND I ABOUT. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS ALLISON REGAN I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD OF COURSE ONE ECHO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER OSTROM ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM HAS SAID I ALSO JUST WANT TO POINT OUT. THIS BILL IS REALLY IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING BILL IT'S MEANT TO ADDRESS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS A CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. BECAUSE IT SEEKS TO CURB THE MOST EGREGIOUS ABUSES THAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND WHERE SOME UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS WILL TARGET THE MOST VULNERABLE FAMILIES WHO ARE AT RISK FOR DISPLACEMENT. SO THIS CLOSE OF SOME OF THOSE LOOPHOLES AND GETS BACK TO WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL WAS WHICH WAS TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO COMPLETELY LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET. AND SO AS AS BRIAN SAID WE'RE SEEING IT BEING USED NOW IS A SWORD INSIDE OF THE SHIELD THEM THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE USED AS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD JUST AT. ONE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS A THIS WAS A POINT OF FOR. OUR CONTENTION AND NOW AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND ALSO OF INTEREST TO US SOME MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THERE'S AN ISSUE. RELATING CA VACANT UNITS OF AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT TO A WE HAVE AGREED TO IT AFTERWARD RENTAL TO THE WORD UNIT. IN SECTION SEVEN OF SIX OH POINT FOR OF OF THE LAW. AND AND THAT IS BROUGHT US TOGETHER AROUND THAT VACANT UNIT ISSUE. THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORTERS. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SILVIUS ELITES JOHN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN SUPPORT OF THAT TEN A PROTECTIONS IN THIS MEASURE THINKING. ANYA LAWLER ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. AT LUIS WERE ON DAY WITH CALIFORNIA MADE SPLIT. NOW TO THE OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SHAUN TO TAKE IN ON THE UP CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. WANT THINK DIESEL NUMBER FOR WORKING WITH US DILIGENTLY LATE INTO THE NIGHT YESTERDAY AND TODAY I THINK WE'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS A WITH REGARD TO THE AMENDMENTS AND WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT AND THAT. I THINK HAS MOVED FORWARD ONCE YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE I THINK ORGANIZATION WILL REASSESS THEIR POSITION TO YOU A COUPLE THINGS I JUST WANNA POINT OUT REGARDING THE ALSO ACT AS. IT REALLY WAS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION PASSED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT A PROPERTY OWNER COULD EXIT THE MARKET AND IT'S IMPORTANT PUT THIS INTO CONTEXT THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE TO USE. THE OUTSIDE WHETHER IT'S IN SAN FRANCISCO WEST HOLLYWOOD OR SANTA MONICA THEY ARE VERY SMALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS ACCORDING TO DATA FROM EACH OF THOSE CITIES THE AVERAGE UNIT SIZE IS LESS THAN FOUR CITIES ARE SMALL MOM AND POPS. WHO ARE USING THE ELLIS ACT? AN OWNER WHO HAS A LARGE BUILDING DOES NOT TYPICALLY DO THIS IT DOESN'T MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE THEY'RE IN THE BUSINESS OF STAYING IN THE RENTAL MARKET. SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT NOTICE ALSO WHEN THE OUTSIDE IS USED IT'S ALWAYS USED AS A LAST RESORT IT IS INCREDIBLY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO GO TO AN OUTSIDE PROCEEDING. IT COSTS UPWARDS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS SOLDIERS DO USE IT AS A LAST RESORT. THAT BEING SAID I THINK OUR OBJECTIVES WITH THIS LEGISLATION WAS TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS BALANCE. AND THAT LITTLE UNITS COULD BE RETURNED TO THE RENTAL MARKET AFTER A APPEARED OF TIME THAT WAS REASONABLE AND I THINK WE'VE GONE TO THAT WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT IN. YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THAT WE FACE A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS SO WE WOULD LIMIT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN UNITS TO THEM RENTAL MARKET. HOT SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WE APPRECIATE THESE ON NUMBER WORKING TOWARDS THAT GOAL AND I THINK WERE. WE'VE GONE THERE BUT ONCE YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO. ASSESS OUR POSITION THINKING. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED OF THE ELLIS ACT WAS A BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE THE THAT WAS REACHED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO ALLOW RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. IDEA TO BURDENSOME ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ALSO WAS OF AS WAS PREVIOUSLY NOTED PRIOR TO THE ELLIS ACT UNLIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS A RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS WERE FORCED. TO STAY IN BUSINESS EVEN WHEN SUBJECTED TO EXTREME FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. THE L. SAT DOES PROVIDE A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO GIVE CERTAINTY TO BOTH PROPERTY OWNERS A AND TENANTS ALIKE. SEE OR OPPOSES AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR. BECAUSE AMONG OTHER THINGS. IT SEEKS TO WEAKEN THIS BIPARTISAN COMPROMISE BY DISCOURAGING RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS FROM RETURNING RENTAL UNITS A TO THE MARKET IF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IMPROVE. SEE OUR CONTINUES OF COURSE. TO ACTIVELY SUPPORT A HOUSING LEGISLATION THAT INCREASES SUPPLY. AND WE DO. LOOK FORWARD TO OF REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE MENTIONED. BY SIMPLY MEMBER BLOOM HOWEVER AT THIS TIME WE MUST OPPOSE AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR AS IT IS IN PRINT. BECAUSE IT WILL EXACERBATE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BY KEEPING MUCH NEEDED RENTAL UNITS OFF THE MARKET EVEN LONGER. SEER LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY FOUR THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME MEMBERS OF RANKINGS AND I REPRESENT FOR REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS. I IN THE DAY TWO OF US WROTE THAT ELLIS ACT. ENDOWMENTS WHEN I HAD MORE HERE AND I WASN'T QUITE AS GREAT. THE. I'M TO SPEAK TO THE BILL. THAT MISTER BLOOM HAS OUTLINED IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AT SOME FUTURE DATE PROBABLY BY. THE NEXT COMMITTEE HEARING. LOG THIS IS. AND I JUST WANT A. EMPHASIZE A COUPLE POINTS. LOCAL GOVERNMENT STILL HAVE TREMENDOUS CONTROL OVER AND ELLIS ACTION. THEY CAN REGULATED IF YOU WANTED DEMOLISH IT THEY CAN REGULATE IT IF YOU WANT TO CREATE IT A HOMEOWNERSHIP PART OF OPPORTUNITY OR A CONDOMINIUM. IF YOU WELL THEY CAN REGULATE IT IN TERMS OF WHO OCCUPIES IT EVEN IF IT'S A OWNER OCCUPIED UNITS. THEY CAN DECIDE. IF YOU WANNA CHANGES LAND USE THE ONLY TWO THINGS THEY CAN'T DO TODAY. IS TO. LEAVE IT A. TOTALLY UNOCCUPIED UNIT OR EVENTUALLY. GET TO AN OWNER OCCUPIED UNIT. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSTRUCT OF HOW IDEALISTS ACTION OR THE ELLIS ACT DOES NOW MISTER BROOM HAS A PRICKLY POINTED OUT IF THERE ARE FRAUDULENT IF YOU WILL. ACTIVITIES ARE ACTIONS BY A PROPERTY OWNER. TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS TEMPORARILY COME BACK. WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AS LONG AS WE RECENTLY ADDRESS IT AND MISTER BLOOM I THINK IS ADEQUATELY. PRESENTED AN OUTLINE FOR A DISCUSSION AN AMENDMENT TO THE ELVES. SO PROBABLY. A SUBJECT TO AS WE ALWAYS SAY. LET. TO US WHEN WE SEE THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO BRING ALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER SECOND. IF WE REGULATE. ELLIS ACTIVITY SO HARD BIKE SAN FRANCISCO HOUSE AND. LANDLORD ACTIVITY. IT IS BEEN DOCUMENTED BY INDEPENDENT THINK TANKS THAT THIRTY THOUSAND UNITS ARE OFF THE MARKET IN JUST IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WE KNOW WHAT IT'S DOCUMENTED. OUR AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER COMMUNITY REALTOR COMMUNITY. AT DOCUMENTED AND STUDY THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT STUDY. THIRD AND FINAL POINT. DOUBTS YOU WHAT. MISTER BLOOM OUTLINED. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE SUCH A CONSTRUCT. THAT. WE PERMANENTLY MAKE SURE THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER THAT DOES WANT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS LEGITIMATELY WANT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. NEVER COMES BACK AGAIN BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BILL COMING INTO COMMITTEE. AND I'D I TRUST THAT IS NOT MR BLOOM'S OBJECTIVE IS TO ASSURE THAT IF THE PROPERTY OWNER IS GOING TO GO OUT. TEMPORARILY GO OUT AND THEY WANT TO IMPROVE THE PROPERTY THEY GO WINNING RENOVATE THE PROPERTY. THAT THAT PROPERTY OWNER HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO DO THAT LEGITIMATELY DO THAT AND THEN GO BACK IN THE RENTAL HOUSING BUSINESS IF THEY SO CHOOSE. OR HAVE THEIR FAMILY OWNER OCCUPY THAT VERY UNIT. AND. WITHOUT THIS THIS PUTS US IN A THAT A DIFFICULT POSITION. OTHER OPPONENTS HAVE EXPRESSED AS THE BILL. IS CAME TO COMMITTEE. ALL OF US ARE OPPOSED TO IT WE'RE GLAD THAT MR PEROT. HAS. HAS REACHED SOME. DISCUSSION DECISION POINTS HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MR BLOOM AND PROPONENTS THANK YOU. OTHER OPPONENTS MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEEP CARLSON FOR THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA RENTAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATION. BUT WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE'RE INTERESTED IN AND LOOKING AT THE AMENDMENTS COUPLE OF POINTS TO ADD ON. ENOUGH THE REPETITIVE. THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS THAT DEPICTIONS. IN COMMUNITIES. IS. BASICALLY INFINITESIMAL COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF UNITS IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S GONE UP LIKE THIRTY PERCENT OR FORTY PERCENT GAP TO LOOK AT THE GROSSMAN'S DANCES AND THAT. WAS ONE OF OUR MAJOR CONCERNS. WITH THE THE REQUIREMENT OF A OF AN ENTIRE YEAR FOR EVERYBODY UNDER THE ELLIS ACT. AND WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT MR BLOOM IS LOOKING TO. LOOKING TO CHANGE THAT. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY HAD A. IT WAS SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN THEIR FAMILY. THAT DEATH HAD TO YOU KNOW HAD TO MOVE THE UNIT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO AN OCTAVE AT SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE AMENDMENTS TAKING A LOOK AT THEM WE DO APPRECIATE. A BIT ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOMS CONSIDERATION OF OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT BEEN RAISED IN DIRE AND. WE WILL REASSESS OUR POSITION ONCE WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT OPPONENT. I MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PET RIGHT WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WE TOO ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND I WON'T BE REPETITIVE. WERE POSTED BILL FOR SIMILAR REASONS THAT YOU'VE ALL HEARD WE DO APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOMS WILLINGNESS. IT TO AMEND THE BILL AND WE WILL REASSESS OUR POSITION WHAT WE SEE THE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU. CURRENT LET'S SERVE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION. DISCUSSION. SURE MISTER CHOI. THANK YOU AUTHOR AWESOME AND WHEN NOT BLOOM OUT FOR YOUR. BEALL. ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO. TIGHTEN UP. AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO FOUR GUNMEN. A TO STAY OR INTERESTED IN OFFERING THEIR RENTAL UNITS ARE. BY INCREASING OUT. THE EARS OF FROM FIVE YEARS OF TO TENURE HERSELF FROM. A TWO YEAR STUFF TO FIVE YEARS EXTENDING THE AMOUNT WAS NOTICES SIDE THAT THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE AND THEN ALSO TEN ON SO. RIGHT TO COME BACK. NOT AT THE SAME RATE. ALL OF THESE SO TO ME. DO YOU OWN SHORTLY BELIEVE I DISAPPEARED CLEAN UP THAT THIS LANGUAGE ELECT IS. WE INCREASE OUR FUTURE AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS. WHAT WILL IT DISCOURAGE? THE ARE LANDLORDS ALL PROPERTY OWNERS SET TO ENTER. CARPENTER MARKETS. MY ANSWER TO THAT. IF HOUSE A INTERESTED IN INVESTING AWESOME RIGHT TO UNITS. OUR DO MY BEST TO STAY AWAY FROM. SUCH CITIES. WITH FIAT WITH PROVINCIAL. BECAUSE OUT FAR MORE MY HANDS ARE TIED UP. HOW WOULD YOU IN ENCOURAGE ME? TO ENTER FOUGHT FOR EXAMPLE. THE CURRENT BUILDING. IS A DILAPIDATED DOT OWNER IMPROVE. AND IT ACOSTA YOU KNOW. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO WHAT YOU EVEN REBUILDING MAY COST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND THEN I HAVE THOUGHT. ALL FOUR THAT THAT'S A NEW NEED THAT THE SAME SAME SAME PRIZE. HOW HOW CAN I RECOUP BY THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AFTER INVESTING? BECAUSE OF THE DISCOURAGE MONEY. THAN I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE IT UP. AND THEN THE UNICELLULAR WATER YOU KNOW. BECOME. IS SO BAD THE INHABITABLE AND THEN THE YOU'RE GO AFTER HIM. CALL NOT THE. A MAINTAINING THE UNIT THAT THIS ASIDE LIKE A CATCH TWENTY TWO IS SOMEONE. NEGATIVITY AND THAT DISCOURAGE MONTH OF WOODLAND ALL DONE. TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOMES. WHAT I THINK I THINK HER THE QUESTION? ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. AND THE. ALL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES HAVE VISIONS OF THAT ALLOW THE LOCAL. AND STABILIZATION BOARD TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN RENT THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE NEED FOR UPKEEP AND IMPROVEMENTS. AND I TOOK A AND PROPERTIES. A BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THIS BILL. IS. TRYING TO SEEK A BALANCE. FOR THOSE LANDLORDS WHO LEGITIMATELY NEED OR DESIRE TO GO OUT OF THE RENTAL BUSINESS AND THEY WERE. SOME COMMENT STUFF FROM THE. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL ABOUT TARA. LANDLORDS WHO MAY WANT TO. I HAVE A UNIT TO A VACANT AND ARE MAKING IN A VACANT ORDER TO LOCATE. A PARENT OR. SOMEONE WHO NEEDS TO MOVE INTO THE BUILDING AND THAT'S COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD. AND WE LEAVE THAT UNTOUCHED BUT THIS. LOG. SEEKS TO DRAW BALANCE THAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE NOT MUCH BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE FAVORABLE TO TENANTS WHO ARE ALSO IN THE CURRENT HOUSING MARKET. FACING A CRISIS WHEN THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVE THROUGH AN INFECTION AND AFFORDABLE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. WHO ARE FORCED TO LEAVE AND AFFORDABLE UNIT? AND ALL OF THE PROPERTIES AROUND THEM ARE UNAFFORDABLE. AND THAT IS ALSO A CRISIS IN AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I THINK WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THAT ISSUE BUT. OF IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. WE ARE NOT TO. REPEALING THE LAW AND NOT SEEKING TO REPEAL LAW WERE SIMPLY SEEKING TO MAKE IT MORE FAIR FOR ATTENDANCE. AND TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY FOR LANDLORDS. HE HAS HAD THEIR THE COMMENTS MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU SHERMAN I THINK MISTER BLOOM OF FOR YOUR. YOUR COMMENTS IN THE PRESENTATION AND AND FORGIVE ASH TROUBLE LITTLE WITH THIS ISSUE IN PART BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE RENT CONTROL IN SAN DIEGO AND SO SOME OF IT IS UNFAMILIAR TO ME. UNDERSTANDING HOW FOLKS WOULD NAVIGATE. YOU'VE EXISTING PROVISIONS ARE ALICE OR WHAT IS PROPOSED. IS ALL DIFFICULT ME SO PLEASE GO EASY ON ME IF YOU WOULD BUT BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU HAVE COMMITTED TO DIED THIS MORNING CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF THE MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. AT THIS TIME. I'M ASKED MS REGAN TO DO CAPITA BECAUSE SHE'LL DO WITH MORE CLARITY THAT I. NASCAR GO EASY ON THE. ABSOLUTELY SO AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE THIS THIS DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO. CHANGE. BUT THE LANDLORD'S ABILITY TO LEAVE THE RENTAL MARKET WHAT IT DOES IS IT. BALANCES OUT. THE IT VIENT INCENTIVE NOW TO EMPTY THE BUILDING IN ORDER TO PUT IT BACK ON THE MARKET TO CHARGE MARKET RATES ESSENTIALLY SO. WHO'S AT RISK HERE ARE THE CURRENT TENANTS WHO ARE WHO ARE PROBABLY LONG TERM LOW RENT TENANTS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE. IT BECAUSE IF SOMEONE HAS IT HAS USED THE ALICE BILL PROPERLY THEY WILL HAVE LEFT THE RENTAL MARKET ENTIRELY. AND SO THE CONCERN WAS FOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ARE ONLY SEEKING TO USE IT AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE IN ORDER TO EMPTY THE BUILDING AND SO WHAT THE MEASURES ARE. OUR TO OUR INCREASE RIGHT NOW THERE'S A RESTRICTION. THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS IN PLACE OF SOMEONE RE ENTERS THE MARKET IN TWO YEARS WE'VE INCREASED THOSE TO FIVE YEARS OF THE SAME RESTRICTIONS ARE PLACED BUT THE TIME LIMIT IS TWO TO FIVE OKAY. FOR EVERY INSTANCE OF THERE'S TWO YEARS AND NOW GOES TO FIVE YEARS ARACHNIDS FOR OKAY. THE SECOND PROVISION IS A FIVE YEAR RESTRICTION PROVISION THAT REMAINS AS IT IS WE ORIGINALLY WERE UPPING THAT TEN WE'VE WITHDRAWN THAT AT THE REQUEST OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. THE OTHER THING THAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE ELIMINATED THERE'S THERE WAS A CAP ON DAMAGES FOR SOME OF THE PROVISIONS WE'VE TAKEN THAT OUT. AND THEN. THE OTHER THING IS WE'VE CLARIFIED IT'S A IT'S A CLARIFICATION. WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL TO HAVE ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PROPERTY WHERE IT CONCERNS OF THE TIMELINES FOR THESE RESTRICTIONS AND WE'VE CLARIFIED THAT. IN VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE BILL TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT THAT THERE IS ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE FOR THE PROPERTY AND ALSO THAT. BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN ONLY WITHDRAW ALL OF THE UNITS FROM THE FROM THE RENTAL MARKET YOU CAN'T THEN. RETURN THEM TO THE RENTAL MARKET IN A PIECEMEAL FASHION IN THE PROPERTIES OF THEIR ON THE RENTAL MARKET ARTS OFF. OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND THE FOUR MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY CSUS AGREED TO WITH SOME OF THE STAKEHOLDERS HER HERE. IS THAT THAT THE TWO YEAR. TIME LIMIT NOW GOES TO FIVE YEARS EVE NOT YOU'VE OUT REMOVE THE TEN YEAR EXTENSION KEEPING AT THE EXISTING FIVE WHICH IS CURRENT LAW. THAT THERE'S NO CAP ON DAMAGES FOR PROPERTY OWNERS WHO VIOLATE THE TERMS OF ALICE. TIME AND THAT THERE IS A UNIFORM WITHDRAWAL DATE NOT A PEACE MILLON SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THE BILL THAT WERE FACED WITH. THEIR TWO PROVISIONS THAT I WOULD BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I WANNA MAKE SURE WITH FIVE POINT ONE IS A DIVERT PIPELINE PROVISION I RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE COULD BE IN A RAIN DALLAS PROCESS TODAY. I'M I THINK PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS NOW IN ADVANCE OF THIS BECOMING LAW A WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THAT IN THIS BILL SO WE'VE AGREED WE'VE AGREED TO THAT IN PRINCIPLE EMERGES. FIRING UP THE LANGUAGE. THE RESULT OF. OKAY. SOME HERE AND THAT AND THAT WILL BE CLEAR IN THAT YOU DON'T. UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR OUR DESIRE TO DO SOME ADDITIONAL ACTION YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO TREAT PEOPLE. WHO FOLLOWING THE RULES CURRENTLY? IN THAT WAY HIM AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO CHANGE IT YOU KNOW. DIDN'T SPY SAFE YOUR INTERNET TODAY YOU PLAY BY TODAY'S RULES IF THE LAW CHANGES SUBSEQUENTLY. THEN THE THAT THOSE RULES WILL APPLY OKAY. AND THEN THE THE LAST QUESTION IS WITH CARTED TO THE VACANT UNITS. ISSUE I AND MR BUT I THINK YOU WERE SAYING THAT THERE'S A. A TERM WHICH I DON'T MAYBE THE SIGNIFICANCE IS LOST ON ME BUT VENTED. UNIT YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT. SURE THERE THERE WAS A REQUEST US A SEVENTY SIXTY POINT FOUR WE'VE CHANGED THE WORD ACCOMMODATIONS TO UNIT. BECAUSE WE WILL AGAIN THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE POSITION THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE WITHDRAWAL DATE AND SOME COURTS HAVE BEEN CONFUSED BY THE USE OF THE WORD ACCOMMODATIONS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IN ONE THING AND ONE SECTION ANOTHER THING AND SOMETHING ELSE. SO WE CHANGE THE WORD TO UNIT. DEPARTMENT SUSPICION ASKED US TO ADD THE WORD RENTAL IN FRONT OF THAT UNIT THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS THAT IT MIGHT SOMEHOW CHANGED THE MEANING OF THE SECTION OTHERWISE. OKAY. IN TURN OF. SO KNOW JUST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAN WE APPRECIATE THAT I THINK CLARIFYING IT SAY RENTAL UNIT IS INTERPRETED A LOT OF ME OR SOMEBODY WAS ACTUALLY IN THE UNIT AND IT WAS OCCUPIED. AS OPPOSED TO A UNIT THAT MAYBE. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO CLARIFY. THAT I COULD LEADING TO LAW SCHOOL SO I THAT THAT'D AYE SIGNIFICANCE IS LOST UPON ME BUT I I. I I I IF YOU GUYS ARE SAFE QUESTION IS THIS BASICALLY WHAT THE CURRENT FORM OF THE BLL YES I JUST WANTED TO MENTION TO MEMBERS WE CIRCULATED COPY THE MOST RECENT SET OF AMENDMENTS I ACTUALLY. WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTIES FOR ENGAGING AS INTENSELY AS YOU'VE HAD AN AND RECENT DAYS ARE TO TO TO TRY TO TAKE TO CREATE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON THIS. SO I JUST IF I CAN SUM UP BY I LIKE HUMANS CHEN I THINK THAT'S ADMIRABLE I'D OFTEN IN THIS BUSINESS PEOPLE SAID NEVER SPECTER CORNERS AND JUST HOLLER NOTHING GETS DONE. I'M INTIMATELY THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE ANYWAY THIS IS REALLY THE BAR CONTEXT OF HOUSING CRISIS UNDERSTAND MISTER BLOOM IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND I APPRECIATE PARTY'S GETTING TO THE TABLE AND I HEAR FOLKS ARE WILLING TO WORK. AYE I CAN I WILL LIMIT LOOK AT THIS AND WHILE MY COLLEAGUES AT RESPOND BUT. I IN THAT SPIRIT OF COOPERATION YOU KNOW I I I CAN SEE THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUING AYE SIR THE RESERVE. EIGHTY FIVE SIR FINAL DECISION BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. AGAIN I SORT OF STRUGGLE WITH THIS ISSUE AYE AYE GENERAL SENSE. BUT YOU KNOW IF I IF BOTH PARTIES CAN COME TO AGREEMENT WHO AM I TO SAY NO RIGHT. BUT AYE AYES ARE LOOK FOR THIS CONTINUING DISCUSSION AND A GET DEEP APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR WHO. AYE AYE LIKES HIS MY HOUSING GURU OF I LOOKED HIM ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE I KNOW HE CARES ABOUT HIS PASSION AS I DO. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM FIRST PERSON AT THIS TABLE TRYING TO WORK ON THIS AS WELL AS THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO ON DIDN'T HAVE TO SET THE TABLE BUT ARE WORKING HARD TO TRY TO GET TO. GET TO THE SOMETIME LEVEL CONSENSUS. MISS A MONTH THANK YOU. I THINK YOU. ARE EVERYONE FOR WORKING SO MUCH ON THIS AND HOPE OVER THE LAST TO AM YOU KNOW TWO DAYS THERE'S BEEN A FLURRY OF INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. I GUESS I SHOULD START OFF BY JUST SAYING THAT AND YOU KNOW MY LENDS FOR THIS WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN A MINUTE MIGHT OF BEEN LAST YEAR. I'M DUE TO A COUPLE THINGS ONE TO THE FACT THAT AND NOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT RENT CONTROL I DON'T JUST THINK ABOUT IT YOU KNOW STAINED IN ONE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. BUT AS A TRUE REALITY THAT. WE MAY HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE WHERE THIS MAY BE A STATEWIDE ISSUE SO I THINK OF IT IN THE CONTEXT OF LIKE WHAT WOULD THIS MEAN NOT JUST FOR MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE YEARS. OF WORKING ON THIS BUT SHOULD THIS TIME AND THAT HAPPENING AND THROUGH A STATEWIDE BALLOT INITIATIVE ON WHAT KIND OF IMPACT HAS AND THE SECOND PIECE IS. BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH. OBSCURE CREATIVE. SCARY KIND OF HOUSING SITUATION IN MY DISTRICT LIKE I DO NOW WITH THE NATURAL DISASTERS. AND I HAVE. SO MANY EXAMPLES NOW OF THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT OF THE BOX. AND AND IN THINGS THAT. I. I COULDN'T HAVE NECESSARILY THOUGHT OF. BUT BEFORE THIS BUT THAT ALSO WORRY ME BECAUSE. I DID THERE'S A LOT OF HOUSING THAT NEEDS TO BE REBUILT AND BUT THERE'S ALSO I MEAN THERE WAS A PERIOD IN INVENTOR OF WHERE WE WERE WE WE CAN FAN FIND VACANCIES ANYWHERE AND WE NEEDED TO PUT PEOPLE AND. ANY SEE MY COLLEAGUE WHOSE EXPERIENCES I MEAN WE'RE SO. IT'S JUST DIFFERENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE SOLUTION IS. BUT THOSE TO THOSE TWO THINGS I THINK AND HAVE ME LOOKING AT THIS BILL I'M IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAT I MAY HAVE OTHERWISE LOOKED AT IT. AND AND I KNOW. THAT I'VE. WE'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH WITH ASK QUESTIONS. HAD THEY WENT THROUGH THE IN ALLEGANY OUNCES AND YOU KNOW POINT OUT SOME SOME AREAS THAT WERE HOW. THAT WERE OF CONCERN AND I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT. THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT ON MULTIPLE SITES. BY I THINK THE CLARIFICATION ON AND IN A DEFINED DEFINING THE WITHDRAWAL DATE. ON WHEN I'M UNITS GO BACK INTO THE MARKET ARE PIECES THAT. I THINK OUR AS WAS SPOKEN NEEDED I'M AND THIS WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE A LOOP AROUND. LA. I ALSO AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ONES ABOUT WHEN YOU KNOW THAT THE TIMING TWO TO FIVE FIVE TO TEN. JUST CREE OTHER PARTICULAR ISSUES SO. IE I DEFINITELY I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE I IT DOES CHANGE HOW I THINK ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM TO THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE HAD AND TO THE BACK AND FORTH. AND I THINK THAT EM IT MERITS A ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HAPPENS IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ON AND HOW THOSE ARE DEFINED BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT AS THIS MOVE FORWARD. I WORRY JUST ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN I HAVE FOR ENTIRE STATE SHOULD THIS THAT RENT CONTROL BECOME A AN ISSUE THE ENTIRE STATE NOT JUST MUNICIPALITIES AND ALSO. AND LIVING IN PRECARIOUS SITUATIONS WHERE WE DON'T KNOW. ONE DAY TO ANOTHER WHAT THAT HOUSING MARKET LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THAT'S HOW QUICKLY IT CHANGE IN A DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE NATURAL DISASTERS. AND OF THE COMPASS JIM WOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND. SO I DID BACK IN JANUARY WE HEARD BILL ON RENT CONTROL IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND AT THAT TIME I CONVEYED. CONVEYED MY. MY HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR IN THE STAKEHOLDERS WOULD YEAH I I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A COMPROMISE AND SO I WHAT I WOULD. REALLY WANT TO SAY IS I'M WAS START BY COMMENDING THE AUTHOR AND FOR BRINGING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO CASH INCOME TO COMMON GROUND ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW THESE ARE THESE ARE REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES. ALSO. APPRECIATE THE OPTICIANS RECOGNITION THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM HAS BEEN ABUSED AT LEAST IN PART BY SOME FOLKS. AND WE NEED TO REVISIT THE PROTECTIONS ARE OFFERED TO TENANTS AND I THINK THAT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I STILL HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE BILL I THINK THERE'S STILL WORK TO DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS CONTINUE CONVERSATION CONTINUE THOUGH SO. THERE COULD BE SOME BAD ACTORS. AND THAT HAVE EXPLOITED LOOPHOLES AND TEN PROTECTION LAWS AND I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE SO FAR SO. SO BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN COMMITTEE A COMMITTEE TODAY WANT THANK YOU OFTEN STAKEHOLDERS FOR THEIR WORK. THANKS FOR COME TO COME TOGETHER TO THE TABLE*. ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU CAN. BOB I WILL HAVE US SECOND CHANCE LOOK AT HIS BILL WHEN HE GOES TO JUDICIARY. ARE BUT I WANT TO DO WHEN I THINK OF BOTH SIDES FOR. FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT IS PROCESS IT'S A VERY IMPRESSIVE. A SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND THERE WITHOUT I WANT APPROVED A BILL. GREAT THIS MOTION MOVE THE BILLS ARE SECOND. BY DOCTOR WOULD LET ME MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS A FIRST OF ALL IN MY CITY IN SAN FRANCISCO IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE HAD. OF THOUSANDS OF TENANTS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO THE ELLIS ACT SANTA. A THE THE STORIES RELATED TO THEM AND THE INTENSITY OF THE CRISIS HAVE WAIT ON ALL OF US WHO ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS. I THINK THE EARLY INTENT OF THIS LAWS ONE THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON TO ALLOW. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES FOR PROPERTY OWNERS THAT WANNA GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS TO TO DO THAT ARMED BUT I DO AGREE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION THAT IN RECENT YEARS. WITH SOME OWNERS WE HAVE SEEN THE SHE'LL TURN INTO A SORT. AND ARE AND I KNOW THAT THESE ARE VERY TECHNICAL AND AND DIFFICULT POLICY AREAS TO. TO WRAP AROUND BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE. BOTH SIDES COME TO THE TABLE. AND THE INTENSITY OF YOUR. DISCUSSIONS ON THIS I DO WANNA SAY THERE WERE THERE WAS A COMMENT SUGGESTED THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LOT OF CONTROL OVER ELLIS ACT IN AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CERTAINLY MY CITY. OF OUR CITIES UNITED AND AND AND IN BELIEVING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME LEVEL OF RELIEF OF THE I ALSO WANNA JUST ASKS AND MR KINGSTON ARM YOU HAD REFERENCE THE SUGGESTION THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO THERE THIRTY THOUSAND VACANT UNITS. I'VE HEARD THAT STATISTIC NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY GIVE ME A REPORT THAT SUGGESTS THAT SO IF YOU HAVE ONE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE ELEVEN ASKING FOR FOR THE BETTER PART OF FOR. MANY MANY MONTHS. AND I DO KNOW. AND UNDERSTAND FROM THE AUTHOR THAT. THERE'S A COMMITMENT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS AND I THINK THAT IS. ARE ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE SO WITH THAT I HAVE NOT MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASS IT. WITH THE COMMITMENT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHORS MADE I HAD THOUGHT I WAS AN EARLY CO AUTHOR OF THIS I JUST CHECKED I DON'T THINK I AM HAPPY TO BE ADDED. TO THAT IS A SIGH GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND UNLESS THERE'S ANY FINAL DISCUSSION. LEAVE IT TO THE AUTHOR TO MY CLOSING COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN ND MEMBERS OF THE. COMMITTEE THERE. WERE OUT I THINK MORE THAN ONE COMMENT MADE ABOUT ISSUES THAT GO WELL BEYOND. THE. THAT THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE US HOWEVER I WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK THE. DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD TO THIS POINT AND I KNOW THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING PROVIDE. US WITH A GOOD MODEL FOR RESOLVING SOME OF THOSE LARGER ISSUES WE'RE AT A POINT IN TIME IN THE STATE WHERE THE HOUSING CRISIS I THINK IS. WELL UNDERSTOOD DE UP BEYOND THE WALLS OF THIS BUILDING A AND AND AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF OPINIONS ABOUT. WHAT THE BEST RESOLUTION IS TO THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT? DISCUSSIONS AROUND RENT CONTROL ARE ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK IT'S NO SECRET TO ANYONE THAT DATA. WE HAVE. AT THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT. MAY HAVE A MAYOR MAY NOT GO FORWARD. I I THINK I SHARE WITH THE CHAIR OF THE OPINION THAT THAT HE HAS STATED AFFECT THIS I NOTICE. THAT LEGISLATION IS A BETTER WAY TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES AND SO. SINCE THE WORK OF. A LARGER DISCUSSION HAS BEEN RAISED HERE IN THE CHAIR'S NOT. RULING ME OUT OF ORDER I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS HERE WE OUGHT TO BE. TRYING TO USE THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT IT HAPPENED THUS FAR AS A MODEL FOR RESOLVING SOME OF THOSE DISPUTES AS WELL. AND TO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ARRIVAL. RIGHT. THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PUSHING THROUGH PASSING REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY CHU HI SHOE I MAIENSCHEIN. AND CHANT NO. CHAO. SHALL I CHOI. CHOICE YOU KNOW. GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LIMA. THE MORE I WOULD. BUT I. YOUR BILLS OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. COLLEAGUES WITH ONE FINAL ITEM IN THAT IS MINE OF FILE ITEM TWELVE A. B. THIRTY SEVENTY TWO AND GOING TO HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES HOPEFULLY THIS IS A FAIRLY BRIEF ITEM. AB THIRTY SEVENTY TWO WOULD INCREASE OUR STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM BY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. OUR STATES TAX CREDIT PROGRAM HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL ARE IN ITS GOALS AND WOULD IN TURN LEVERAGE ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAX CREDIT LOCAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENTS. IF THIS BILL SOUNDS FAMILIAR AYE IT SHOULD FOR ALL OF YOU WHO WERE IN THE ASSEMBLY THE LAST SESSION. IT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO MY A. B. THIRTY FIVE BILL AND I WANNA THANK EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY FROM LAST SESSION WHO VOTED FOR IT REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. WHILE WE MADE REAL HEADWAY ON HOUSING LAST YEAR WITHOUT INCREASE IN THIS TAX CREDIT THE RECENT REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. IN THE RECENTLY ENACTED FEDERAL TAX PLAN FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO TWENTY ONE PERCENT. HAS HAD AN EXTREMELY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS TO THE TUNE OF REDUCING OUR FOR DOUBLE RENTAL PRODUCTION BY ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND RENTAL UNITS A YEAR. AND ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL TAXES. NOW THE ONE CHANGE WE DO HAVE IN THIS MEASURE COMPARED TO WHAT WE VOTED ON A IN THE LAST SESSION. IN ADDITION TO INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM. WELL THAT THE SIZE THE PROGRAM IS THE SAME AS THE LAST BILL BUT THIS BILL ALSO ELIMINATES THE CAP ON INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX CREDIT AND THAT WAS DESIGNED. TO FURTHER INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE PROGRAM TO INVESTORS AND TO HOPEFULLY COUNTERBALANCE A LITTLE BIT OF THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'VE LOST WITH THE REDEVELOPMENT ELIMINATION. DURING THE GREAT RECESSION OF THE DRYING UP OF HOUSING BOND MONIES IT'S CRITICAL I BELIEVE THAT WE EXPAND THIS TAX CREDIT TO HELP LEVERAGE WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT. ANOTHER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THROUGH OTHER SOURCES AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT TURN IT OVER TO OUR. WITNESSES WITNESSES IN SUPPORT ABOUT MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I MICHELENA NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF IN CALIFORNIA JUST BRIEFLY AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX BECAUSE THE BACKBONE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE.
