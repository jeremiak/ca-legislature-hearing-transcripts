TO URGE A NO VOTE ON THE BUDGET.

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.756
I WILL STIPULATE THAT THERE'S

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:06.658
MUCH IN THIS BUDGET. TO BE

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:08.960
ATTRACTED TO. MUCH THAT IS

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:12.397
POSITIVE. BUT THAT DOES NOT

00:22:12.464 --> 00:22:14.099
OUTWEIGH WHAT I THINK ARE THE

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:17.335
NEGATIVE. ALL THE NEGATIVES

00:22:17.402 --> 00:22:18.470
THERE'S A STANDARD HERE NOW

00:22:18.537 --> 00:22:20.772
IT'S A PROCESS THAT DOESN'T

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:23.308
EXIST A BUDGET PROCESS. I USED

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:24.376
TO BE THAT THE BUDGET WAS

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.445
SUBMITTED SUBCOMMITTEES WOULD

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.980
MEET DELIBERATE. THEN THERE

00:22:29.047 --> 00:22:32.584
WOULD BE A VOTE IN EACH HOUSE-

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:33.785
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE TO

00:22:33.852 --> 00:22:35.387
RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES IN

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.589
THE TWO HOUSE. THAT PROVIDED AN

00:22:37.656 --> 00:22:39.458
OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATE TORS

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:42.127
AND PROTECTING THE CITIZENS TO

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:43.895
DIRECTLY IMPORT THE BUDGET.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.864
WELL FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WE

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:47.132
HAVE NOT HAD A CONFERENCE

00:22:47.199 --> 00:22:50.402
COMMITTEE. IT IN THAT IN A VERY

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.871
TOUGH BUDGET YEAR. WE DIDN'T

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:53.772
HAVE A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:57.175
NOW IN A VERY POSITIVE. BUDGET

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:58.376
YEAR WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A

00:22:58.443 --> 00:22:59.878
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I ASSUME

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.446
THAT THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEES

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:03.315
IN THE SENATE. THE DAYS ARE

00:23:03.381 --> 00:23:07.018
DONE. THAT'S A SAD THING BUT

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:11.990
IT'S THE REALITY. OF THE TIME.

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:13.825
SO NOW WE DEAL WITH A PROCESS.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:17.028
THERE IS COMPROMISE. THIS

00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.830
MORNING IN BUDGET COMMITTEE THE

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.466
PUBLIC DID GET THE COMMENT I

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:22.033
THINK THERE WERE TWENTY FIVE

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.204
PEOPLE. GOT TO CALL IN FOR ONE

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:28.607
MINUTE. AND SAY I'M SO AND SO

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.275
AND I LIKE TO BUT- I DON'T LIKE

00:23:30.342 --> 00:23:32.878
THE BUDGET. THAT'S THE EXTENT

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:35.080
OF THE PUBLIC INPUT. NO

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.848
SPECIFICS THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:40.552
TO CONVEY. NO OTHER VENUE

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.187
THROUGH LEGISLATORS AS IN A

00:23:42.254 --> 00:23:44.656
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. SO

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:49.194
THEY'RE FROZEN OUT. NOW I CAN'T

00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:52.030
BE THE RESIDENT HISTORIAN HERE

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.099
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST BUDGET.

00:23:54.166 --> 00:23:55.801
THAT I REMEMBER VOTING FOR OR

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:58.837
AGAINST. WHERE IN THE GOVERNOR

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:01.439
HAD NOT MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:05.010
THE MAJORITY PARTY. THAT'S NOT

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:07.879
THE CASE TODAY. YOU'RE BETTING

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:10.949
THE FUTURE THAT THERE WILL BE A

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:12.717
RESOLUTION WITH THE MAJORITY

00:24:12.784 --> 00:24:15.921
AND THE GOVERNOR ON MANY ISSUES.

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:18.256
I TRUST THEY WILL BE BUT

00:24:18.323 --> 00:24:19.591
THEY'RE GONNA FOLLOW THEN IN

00:24:19.658 --> 00:24:24.963
THIS PLETHORA. NOW APPROACH TO

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.065
NINETY FIVE BILLS NOT BOOKS

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:29.568
THAT'S JUST OBSCENE. AND MANY

00:24:29.634 --> 00:24:32.637
OF THESE PROVISIONS AND BILLS.

00:24:32.704 --> 00:24:36.474
IN THE TRAILER BELOW DELUGE

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:40.145
WILL BE MAJOR POLICY. DON'T GO

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:40.712
THROUGH ANY POLICY COMMITTEE

00:24:40.779 --> 00:24:43.215
HEARING. I DON'T HAVE ANY

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:48.520
PUBLIC INPUT IT'S JUST A JOB.

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:50.889
THAT IS NO WAY TO CONDUCT THE

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:53.458
LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS. MEETING

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:56.161
STATUTORY BUSINESS OR

00:24:56.228 --> 00:24:58.263
LEGISLATIVE OR BUDGET BUSINESS

00:24:58.330 --> 00:24:59.931
BUT THAT'S THE WAY WE'RE DOING

00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:08.740
THESE DAYS. THE. IN A YEAR OF

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:10.675
NOW SURPLUS LAST YEAR WE HAD A

00:25:10.742 --> 00:25:12.210
HECK OF A DEATH NO GO AHEAD THE

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:13.879
SURPLUS WELL WE'RE STILL

00:25:13.945 --> 00:25:17.682
DRAWING FROM THE RESERVES EVEN

00:25:17.749 --> 00:25:21.786
IN THIS YEAR. A SURPLUS.

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.188
DRAWING FROM THE USERS AND

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:25.323
DOING SOME VIRUS NOW WE'RE

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.292
DOING A LITTLE BIT OF DEBT

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:27.826
RETIREMENT BUT NOT NEARLY

00:25:27.893 --> 00:25:29.861
ENOUGH. WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.963
MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.231
AND WHAT WOULD MOST ASSUREDLY

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:35.600
DOING IS BUILDING THE BASE FOR

00:25:35.667 --> 00:25:38.270
THE FUTURE. AND CLOTHING AS

00:25:38.336 --> 00:25:39.404
RETIRED BY THE GOVERNOR

00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:41.206
CREATING A BUNCH OF NEW

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:44.242
DEPARTMENTS. NOT DEPARTMENTS DO

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:45.911
NOTHING IN GOVERNMENT EXCEPT

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:49.614
GIRL. THEY DON'T GROW SMALLER

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:52.851

ALL OF THE ANY OF THESE WHO ARE

00:26:04.162 --> 00:26:07.365
WORTHY OF A DEPARTMENT STATUS

00:26:07.432 --> 00:26:08.667
OR THAT WE WOULD BE CRIPPLED

00:26:08.733 --> 00:26:10.936
WITHOUT HAVING DEPARTMENT

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:14.806

BLAST NEW INFLATION. CASH

00:26:25.884 --> 00:26:28.453
EXPANDING TO THE FIFTY OR OLDER

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.089
REGARDLESS OF STATUS. IT'S

00:26:31.156 --> 00:26:32.624
GONNA END UP COSTING UP TO A

00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:34.859
BILLION DOLLARS. IN FUTURE

00:26:34.926 --> 00:26:40.198

IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS NOT

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.068
NEW BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:44.736
EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED. IN

MOMENTS OF THIS BUDGET. IT'S A

00:26:55.013 --> 00:26:56.648
PRUDENT BUDGET I WOULD ARGUE

00:26:56.715 --> 00:27:01.486
NOT. IT'S A HELPFUL BUDGET AND

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:03.021
SOME THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE

00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:04.389
TO REDUCE ARE GETTING TO BE

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:07.092
RESTORED. AND MANY OF US COULD

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:10.628
SUPPORT THAT. IF NOT ALL OF US.

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:12.630
BUT NOT THE WHOLE PACKAGE AND

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:15.367

WINDFALL REVENUES. AND MY

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.322
CONCERN ABOUT THE BUDGET THAT'S

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:38.690
BEFORE US DESPITE THE RECORD

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.458
SITTING WINDFALL REVENUES BOTH

THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:44.095
THIS ONE BEFORE US TODAY STILL

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:45.296

HIGHER. BOTH PROPOSALS FAILED

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:51.836
THE FAILED TO RESTORE FUNDING

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:52.904
THAT WAS TAKEN FROM THE RAINY

00:27:52.971 --> 00:27:55.140
DAY FUND LAST YEAR WHEN WE AT

00:27:55.206 --> 00:27:56.908
THAT TIME WE DID THINK WE HAVE

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.309
A DEFICIT IN TENS OF BILLIONS

00:27:58.376 --> 00:28:00.445
OF DOLLARS. THESE CURRENT

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.180
PROPOSALS INCLUDE WITHDRAWING

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.581
EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

RAINY DAY FUND IN THE CURRENT

00:28:05.283 --> 00:28:07.519
YEAR AND IN ADDITION BORROWING

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:09.454

TACTICS IT SHOULD BE COMMON

00:28:16.461 --> 00:28:18.663
SENSE TO REVERSE BUDGET SAVINGS

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.598
ACTIONS NOW. THAT THE BUDGET

00:28:20.665 --> 00:28:22.667
HAS DRAMATICALLY TURNED AROUND

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.536
DOES ANYONE REALLY THINK THAT

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.037
THE VOTERS WHO OVERWHELMINGLY

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:28.173

VOTED TO CREATE THE RAINY DAY

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:30.575
FUND. I THOUGHT THAT THE

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.143
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.145
WOULD NOT FULLY FUND THE RAINY

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:35.613
DAY FUND IN A YEAR WHEN WE ARE

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.816
SEEING RECORD REVENUES EVEN

00:28:37.882 --> 00:28:39.717
WORSE THIS ANYONE THINK THAT

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:40.785
THE VOTERS THOUGHT THE

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.253
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:43.922
WOULD BE BORROWING. FROM THE

00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.590
RAINY DAY FUND IN A YEAR WITH

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:48.293
RECORD REVENUES I THINK NOT FOR

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.961
THESE REASONS I CANNOT SUPPORT

BUDGET PROVIDES MORE FUNDING

00:29:14.619 --> 00:29:16.054
FOR SCHOOLS BUT FAILS TO

00:29:16.121 --> 00:29:17.956
ADDRESS PARENTS CONCERNS BY NOT

00:29:18.022 --> 00:29:19.257
REQUIRING CHILDREN TO BE BACK

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:24.496
IN SCHOOL FULL TIME AND NOT. BE

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.130
AS SOON AS- THEY CONTINUE USED

00:29:25.196 --> 00:29:25.797
USE THE BORROWING STRATEGY FROM

00:29:25.864 --> 00:29:27.465
ONE YEAR WHEN KOBE WAS RAMPANT

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:28.700
IN THE STATE DID NOT HAVE A

00:29:28.766 --> 00:29:30.668
CLEAR PICTURE OF ITS FINANCES.

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:33.171
AND I WILL ADMIT THAT THERE ARE

00:29:33.238 --> 00:29:34.172
SOME GOOD THINGS IN THIS

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:37.008
BUDGET. FUNDING THE TWO

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:37.575
THOUSAND NINETEEN RATE STUDY

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.244
FOR THE DDS COMMUNITY HELPING

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.812
SMALL BUSINESSES WITH GRANTS TO

00:29:40.879 --> 00:29:42.680
RE OPEN. EXPANDING MENTAL

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:44.949
HEALTH TREATMENT BEDS AND FULLY

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:45.517
FUNDING THE BARSTOW VETERANS

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:51.823
HOME. BUT THIS IS NOT D. BUDGET.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.625
WHY ARE WE CONTINUING TO BORROW

00:29:53.691 --> 00:29:55.727
MONEY FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:56.928
WITH ALL OF THE SURPLUS AND

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.429
FINDING THAT WE HAVE THAT DOES

00:29:58.496 --> 00:30:00.198
NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WE

00:30:00.265 --> 00:30:02.233
HAVE A DROUGHT DECLARATION

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.268
WE'RE NOT SPENDING A SINGLE

00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:05.637
PENNY. NOT A SINGLE PENNY ON

00:30:05.703 --> 00:30:07.705
NEW WATER STORAGE PROJECTS WITH

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:10.742
THE SPENDING PLAN. IN TWO

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:11.342
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE VOTERS

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.977
WERE SOLD ON A GAS TAX INCREASE

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:14.312
TO PROVIDE FIVE BILLION IN

00:30:14.379 --> 00:30:16.214
SPENDING FOR ROADS THAT REVENUE

00:30:16.281 --> 00:30:18.616
IS NOW FIFTY BILLION. IS THERE

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:20.685
A NEED TO CONTINUE THE TAX ON

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.120
CALIFORNIANS WHEN GAS IS NOW

00:30:22.187 --> 00:30:23.655
OVER FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON

00:30:23.721 --> 00:30:25.423
NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:26.457
IS THERE A NEED TO

00:30:26.524 --> 00:30:28.793
AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE THE GAS

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.095
TAX NEXT MONTH. ADDITIONALLY

00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:32.664
WHAT CAN BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:34.432
FIXING THE BROKEN SYSTEMS AT

00:30:34.499 --> 00:30:36.234
EDT WHICH YOU ARE ALL WELL

00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:38.436
AWARE OF. HOW CAN THIS BUDGET

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.238
FAILED TO FIX THE BILLIONS OF

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:41.372
DOLLARS IN FRAUD THAT HAD BEEN

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:43.074
ALLOWED. TO FALL INTO THE HANDS

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:44.609
OF INMATES AND FRAUDSTERS

00:30:44.676 --> 00:30:45.543
INSTEAD OF UNEMPLOYED

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.879
CALIFORNIANS WHO ACTUALLY NEED

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:52.483
THE ASSISTANCE. AND FINALLY. I

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.485
FIND IT TO BE NONSENSE TO PAUSE

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:55.620
THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY

00:30:55.687 --> 00:30:57.288
SPENDING AUTHORITY WHEN WE CAN

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:58.590
TAKE IT AWAY PERMANENTLY RIGHT

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:01.626
NOW WITHIN I VOTE ON S. C. R.

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:02.560
FIVE THE REJECTION OF THE

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:03.928
AMENDMENTS THAT I OFFERED MAKE

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:05.530
NO SENSE WHEN YOU CONSIDER

00:31:05.597 --> 00:31:08.132
THEIR INCLUSION AND THIS WITH

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:10.668
THE PAUSE BUTTON IN THIS BUDGET.

00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:11.603
IF YOU WERE WILLING TO TAKE

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:13.471
YOUR POWER BACK BUT ONLY UNTIL

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.273
THE END OF SESSION. WHAT SENSE

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.643
DOES THAT MAKE. IF THE MAJORITY

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:20.478
PARTY IS WILLING TO ABDICATE

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:21.512
ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:23.681
GOVERNOR. THEN WHY HAVE A

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.551
LEGISLATURE AT ALL. IS OUR ONLY

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.419
FUNCTION NOW RELEGATED TO

CURRENTLY IN PLACE IS THAT NOW

00:31:36.527 --> 00:31:39.631
OUR ONLY FUNCTION. I REJECT THE

00:31:39.697 --> 00:31:40.932
PREMISE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS

FIGHTING FOR THE ISSUES AND

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:46.337
SPENDING PRIORITIES THAT AFFECT

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:48.273
THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:49.407

POWERS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF

THE LEGISLATURE FIRST. IT WAS

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:57.982
TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE'S VOICE IS

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.449

MY BUDGET REQUEST. DESPITE ALL

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:20.898
THESE GOOD THINGS I HAVE

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:21.933
CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF

00:33:21.999 --> 00:33:23.801
TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING SENT

00:33:23.868 --> 00:33:25.570
OUT IN THE STATE WITHOUT ANY

00:33:25.636 --> 00:33:28.373
ACCOUNTABILITY DETAILS ARE

00:33:28.439 --> 00:33:30.241

BILLION DOLLARS IN FINES IN

THIS BUDGET WHICH LIT WHICH

00:33:35.113 --> 00:33:36.314
LITTLETON NO DETAIL IS

00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:40.551
AVAILABLE. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:41.652
THAT THE MONEY THAT THE PEOPLE

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.354

TWENTY EIGHT ANY OTHER

00:33:58.536 --> 00:34:01.305
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING

00:34:01.372 --> 00:34:01.906
NONE SINNERS CAN I WOULD LIKE

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:06.277
TO CLOSE. THANKS SO MUCH- I

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:08.980
APPRECIATE THAT OUR COLLEAGUES

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:10.381
FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:13.718
AISLE- DID PRAISE MANY ASPECTS

00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:16.187
OF THIS BUDGET. BECAUSE I THINK

00:34:16.254 --> 00:34:17.855
IT'S A GREAT BUDGET BUT ALLOW

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:20.825
ME TO CORRECT A FEW OF THE

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:23.060
THINGS THAT WERE REFERENCED.

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:26.497
FIRST OFF. THIS IS NOT THE

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:27.899
FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.867
APPROVED A BUDGET BEFORE WE

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:30.802
HAVE COME TO THE FULL

00:34:30.868 --> 00:34:33.838
AGREEMENT- WE PASSED TO A

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:38.476
BUDGET LAST YEAR- INSTANCE PROP

00:34:38.543 --> 00:34:39.844
TWENTY FIVE WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.246
A NUMBER OF TIMES WHERE. THERE

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.481
WERE STILL A FEW THINGS TO WORK

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:46.484
OUT AND- BEFORE WE ARE AT THE

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.685
WYNDHAM MEN MINTS THAT WE HAD

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:50.655
TO DO- BEFORE WE HAD ASSIGNED

00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:52.557
BUDGET SO THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL.

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:54.792
AND THE OTHER POINT THAT I

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:56.861
WANTED TO CORRECT IS THIS ISSUE

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:59.297
OF THAT WE THAT THIS BUDGET

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.299
THAT WHAT THEY ARE SPENDING

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:04.435
PLAN. IS BASED ON BORROWING

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:06.370
FROM THE RESERVES NOT AT ALL.

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.172
THERE WAS THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:11.676
RESERVES IN THE BUDGET WE

00:35:11.742 --> 00:35:14.212
THE EXPECTATION OF DROP IN

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:16.013
REVENUE. WHICH OF COURSE WOULD

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.484
FORTUNATELY DID NOT EXPERIENCE

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:21.986
AND SO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. NOT

00:35:22.053 --> 00:35:24.188
ONLY RESTORES THAT BUT IT

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:28.326
INCREASES THE DEPOSITS IN OUR-

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.328
BSA ARE MEETING OUR BUDGET

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:32.163
SURPLUS ACCOUNT OUR SAFETY NET

00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:34.599
RESERVE IN OUR PROP NINETY

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:37.001
EIGHT SCHOOLS RESERVE. AND THE

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:39.270
RAINY DAY FUND RIGHT NOW HAS

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.272
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION MORE

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:42.540
THAN IS CONSTITUTIONALLY

00:35:42.607 --> 00:35:44.575
REQUIRED SO WE ACTUALLY WITH

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:46.177
THE ADOPTION OF THIS BUDGET

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:47.945
WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST RESERVES

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.914
YET EVER IN THE STATE'S

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.083
HISTORY. SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:54.085
CORRECT THAT ONE I'M IN

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:57.054
ADDITIONALLY. THERE WERE SOME

00:35:57.121 --> 00:35:59.223
REFERENCE IN THE- COMMITTEE

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:00.625
THAT PERHAPS THIS WAS NOT

00:36:00.691 --> 00:36:02.226
BALANCE TO THAT WE WOULD BE

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:03.761
FACING A DEFICIT IMMEDIATELY

00:36:03.828 --> 00:36:07.131
NEXT YEAR. IN FACT THE-

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:08.799
PROJECTION BASED ON

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.769
EXPENDITURES HERE ARE FOR A

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.971
BALANCED BUDGET FOR THE NEXT

00:36:14.038 --> 00:36:17.975
FOUR FISCAL YEARS. SO I THINK

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:18.576
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.411
BE VERY PROUD ABOUT I THINK

00:36:20.478 --> 00:36:22.246
THIS IS A BUDGET THAT REALLY

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:24.081
HELPS CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:26.817
BEEN SO AS WE KNOW ALL OF US

00:36:26.884 --> 00:36:28.653
IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC
