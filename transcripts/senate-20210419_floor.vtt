NOT FINISHED SO LET'S OKAY NICE

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.177

JUDICIAL REVIEW IN THE UNITED

WEAKENED SLIGHTLY IN THE

00:31:38.563 --> 00:31:40.832

TRYING TO A ROAD THAT CHOICE.

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:48.506

00:32:10.061 --> 00:32:12.130
THOUSAND ANNUAL DEATHS. NO ONE

00:32:12.196 --> 00:32:14.599
FORTUNATELY AS I REFERENCED DUE

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.868
TO A WEAKENING OF THE RULING IN

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:19.203
THE NINETIES. THERE HAVE BEEN

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.873
MANY STATE ACTIONS TO TRY TO

00:32:21.939 --> 00:32:25.543
WEAKEN. BROUGH VERSUS WADE AND

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.446
IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS ALONE

00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.648

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.317
NEW TATE LEVEL RESTRICTIONS

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:34.319
HAVE BEEN ENACTED NOT ALL HAVE

00:32:34.385 --> 00:32:36.587
BEEN APPEALED BUT THAT SO MANY

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:38.489
HAVE BEEN PASSED BY DIFFERENT

00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:41.125
LEGISLATURES. CLINIC VIOLENCE

00:32:41.192 --> 00:32:43.127
AND THREATS WHEN PROVIDERS ARE

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:45.763
ON THE RISE. AARON IT IS MORE

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:47.465
AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN TO

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:49.233
EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT DEPENDING

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.135
ON WHERE THEY LIVE BECAUSE OF

00:32:51.202 --> 00:32:52.503
HAVING NO CLINIC ANYWHERE NEAR

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.340
THEM. AS A REFLECT ON THIS

00:32:55.406 --> 00:32:57.575
ANNIVERSARY I THINK ABOUT THE

00:32:57.642 --> 00:32:59.711
CURRENT SUPREME COURT AND

00:32:59.777 --> 00:33:02.313
WHETHER THAT CURRENT MAJORITY

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.082
WILL RESPECT THE WILL OF THE

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.750
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE ONE I

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.585
REFERENCE THE WILL I MEAN. THAT

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:11.122
POLLS AS RECENT AS AUGUST

00:33:11.189 --> 00:33:12.690
TWENTY NINETEEN SHOW THAT SEVEN

00:33:12.757 --> 00:33:15.259
IN TEN AMERICANS DO NOT WANT

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:17.095
ROE VERSUS WADE OVERTURNED. AND

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.930
IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:22.433
AMERICANS 59% HAVE INDICATED A

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.770
GREATER CONCERN IS WITH STATES

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.771
THAT ARE MAKING IT TOO

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:29.741
DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN TO EXERCISE

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.809
THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES.

00:33:31.876 --> 00:33:33.378
FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS A

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:35.179

GENDER EQUITY WILL REMAIN

GRANDSON. TWO SECONDS MAYBE

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:42.973
AFTER HE CAME OUT OF THE WHEN

THE AISLE SAY THAT THAT IS NOT

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.765
A LIFE AND THE WOMAN HAS A

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.300
RIGHT TO CHOOSE TO TERMINATE.

TO CHANGE THERE'S NEW

00:41:16.006 --> 00:41:18.008
TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE THAT SHOWS

00:41:18.075 --> 00:41:19.643
THAT THESE BABIES IN THE WOMB

COLLEAGUES TO- TAKE A DEEP

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:53.911
BREATH CAN SUPPORT THOSE THOSE

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:55.112
YOUNG GIRLS THAT WILL NEVER BE

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.181
BORN THOSE YOUNG BOYS THAT MAY

00:41:57.248 --> 00:41:59.483
HAVE A PROMISING FUTURE- THAT

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.784
WILL HAVE A PROMISING FUTURE IF

THEY WERE ABLE TO BE BORN. I

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:03.520
WOULD LIKE YOU TO THINK ABOUT

THE FOUNDING OF PLANNED

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:05.756

SPECIFIC CLINICS ARE ACTUALLY

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.228
LOCATED AND HOW THAT IS TRULY A

00:42:11.295 --> 00:42:13.597
RACIAL ISSUE. AND I WOULD ASK

OFF TO COLLEGE AND I HOPE THAT-

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:06.383
SHOULD SHE EVER FIND HERSELF IN

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:07.718
A POSITION WHERE SHE'S.

00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:09.186

BACK ON. WHAT SHE WAS TAUGHT IN

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.292
THE HOME WHICH SHE WAS TAUGHT

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:18.195
IN HER CHURCH THAT EVERY- WITH

CREATED AND TO TAKE THAT INTO

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:23.901
CONSIDERATION I DON'T. I FEEL

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.169
AS THOUGH AFTER HAVING BEEN IN

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:28.439
THE LEGISLATURE NOW FOR ALMOST

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:31.041
TEN YEARS THAT. IS IF THERE IS

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:33.277
AN EFFORT FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:37.147
NUMBER ONE IN. IN PROVIDING THE

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.849
MOST NUMBER OF ABORTIONS IN THE

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.984
COUNTRY I DON'T THINK THAT

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.752
THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.854
STRIVING TOWARD I DON'T THINK

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:46.890
PUSHING POLICIES. THAT TAKE THE

LIFE OF AN IS AN INNOCENT CHILD

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:52.296
THOSE AREN'T VALUES. THOSE ARE

00:43:52.363 --> 00:43:55.032
NOT VALUES. WE TALK ALL THE

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:59.470
TIME IN THESE CHAMBERS ABOUT.

00:43:59.536 --> 00:44:01.772
THE VALUE OF A LIFE THE

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:04.141
SANCTITY OF THE LIFE. AND I

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.943
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY DOT

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.712
MINDSET DOESN'T APPLY WHEN

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:09.313
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN UNBORN

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:18.922
CHILD. ABORTION. PUSHING

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.591
POLICIES THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.593
GET AN ABORTION TO MAKE IT

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:23.994
CHEAPER TO GET AN ABORTION TO

00:44:24.061 --> 00:44:26.397
MAKE THEM MORE ABUNDANT THOSE

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:30.334
ARE NOT VALUES I RESPECTFULLY

00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.669
ASK FOR DON'T VOTE THANK YOU.

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:33.303

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:38.542
DEBATE. SEEING NONE SENATE-

STRONG SUPPORTER OF AS OUR SIX

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.917
YEAR PEOPLE CAN HAVE WHATEVER

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:49.153
PERSONAL VIEWS- THEY WANT TO

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.088
HAVE ABOUT ABORTION AND WHAT

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:53.323
MAKES SENSE OF WHAT A WOMAN

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:54.758
BELIEVES MAKE SENSE FOR HER AND

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.828
HER LIFE AND- THOSE ARE ALL

00:44:57.895 --> 00:44:59.963
OPINIONS AT EACH PERSON AS AN

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.000
INDIVIDUAL HIGHS- BUT THE ISSUE

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:06.270
HERE. IS WHETHER WOMEN HAVE THE

00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:08.338
AGENCY AND THE INDEPENDENCE AS

00:45:08.405 --> 00:45:10.407
HUMAN BEINGS TO MAKE CHOICES

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:11.542
ABOUT THEIR OWN BODIES AND

00:45:11.608 --> 00:45:14.344
ABOUT THEIR OWN LIVES. AND

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:14.845
FRANKLY IT'S NONE OF MY

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:17.714
BUSINESS. WHETHER WOMAN DECIDES

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:19.316
SHE WHETHER SHE WANTS TO GET

00:45:19.383 --> 00:45:20.184
PREGNANT WHETHER SHE WANTS TO

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.819
CARRY TO TERM THAT IS HER

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:24.354
CHOICE AND HER CHOICE. ALONE

00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.190
AND WE HAVE MOVED PAST THE

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:27.391
POINT IN TIME NOT EVERYWHERE IN

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.026
THE WORLD BUT WE SAY WE MOVED

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.861
PAST IN THIS COUNTRY. THE POINT

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:32.763
IN TIME WHERE WOMEN WERE VIEWED

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.898
AS PROPERTY OF THEIR HUSBANDS

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.533
OR THEY WERE SUBSERVIENT IN

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.669
SOCIETY AND THEY JUST HAD TO DO

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:40.838
WHAT THEY WERE TOLD- THAT'S NO

00:45:40.904 --> 00:45:42.539
LONGER. THE CASE IN THIS

00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:43.841
COUNTRY AND I HOPE ONE DAY

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:45.642
AROUND THE WORLD- AND IF A

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.444
WOMAN CAN MAKE REPRODUCTIVE

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:49.346
CHOICES FOR HERSELF AND CONTROL

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.448
HER OWN BODY AND CONTROL THE

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:55.018
TIMING OF WHETHER AND WHEN- SHE

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:57.020
HAS A CHILD. THEN THERE IS NO

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:59.823
WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT FULL

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:01.058
INDEPENDENCE AGENCY AND

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:04.561
EQUALITY. SO I ASKED FOR AN AYE

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.497
VOTE. SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:08.999

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:10.567
IN SUPPORT AND I'M KIND OF

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:13.804
MIXED HERE BECAUSE PERSONALLY.

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:16.340
I BELIEVE IN LIFE IN PRO LIFE.

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:19.710
BUT I. WHOLEHEARTEDLY INSTEAD

00:46:19.776 --> 00:46:21.912
FAST BELIEVE IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.081
TO CHOOSE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO DO

00:46:24.148 --> 00:46:27.584
WITH HER BODY AS SHE SEES FIT.

00:46:27.651 --> 00:46:28.952
THEY MANY TIMES WHEN

00:46:29.019 --> 00:46:30.821
INDIVIDUALS CHOOSE TO HAVE AN

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.856
ABORTION IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.158
THE TERMINATOR PRESENT A

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:36.193
PREGNANCY IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.363
OF HEALTH COMPLICATIONS BOTH

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:41.398
FOR THE WOMAN AND THE FOETUS-

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:43.567
BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT'S

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:48.772
ONE OF. MATURITY. THEIR ABILITY

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:51.241
TO RAISE A CHILD THE FINANCIAL

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.644
WORLD WERE ABOUT TO PROVIDE FOR

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:56.613
THAT CHILD AND I GUESS MY REAL

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.183
ROB HERE IS THAT. THOSE WHO ARE

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:02.119
STILL PRO LIFE IN THE WOMB.%

00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:04.454
WELL THE FIRST ADVOCATE FOR

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.156
DEATH OF THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:08.225
ONCE THEY BECOME A TEAM AND

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.460
THEY CROSS THE LINE. SO YOU

00:47:10.527 --> 00:47:12.229
CAN'T BE PRO LIFE IN THE WOMB

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:14.097
N. M. PRO DEATH ONCE THEY

00:47:14.164 --> 00:47:16.066
BECOME AN ADULT SO ON THAT

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.602
REASON AND THOSE REASONS HI

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.204
SCOTT FOR AYE VOTE. SENATOR

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:25.375
KAMLAGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:29.947
I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SR SIX- I

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.248
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:33.550
THAT WE FOCUS THIS DISCUSSION

00:47:33.617 --> 00:47:36.520
ON HEALTH EQUITY AND HEALTH

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:40.624
ACCESS. ACHIEVING HEALTH EQUITY

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:43.393
REQUIRES FINDING THE SYSTEMIC

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:45.362
RACISM THAT CREATES BARRIERS TO

00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:47.497
ALL KINDS OF SEXUAL AND

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.933
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. WE

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.069
HAVE SEEN FROM THIS PAST YEAR

00:47:52.135 --> 00:47:54.137
THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS LAID BARE

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.439
SO MANY RACIAL DISPARITIES IN

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:58.609
HEALTH CARE. BUT WE CAN ALSO

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:01.178
SEE WHO IS MOST AFFECTED. BY

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:03.847
INCREASED ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:05.949
AND IN SKYROCKETING SEXUALLY

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:09.753
TRANSMITTED DISEASE GREAT. WE

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.889
ARE CONTINUING TO FACE

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:15.492
RELENTLESS ATTACKS ON OUR

00:48:15.559 --> 00:48:17.861
ABILITY TO KEEP PROVIDING

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:19.963
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.600
CARE YES INCLUDING ABORTION.

00:48:23.667 --> 00:48:27.904
AND THOSE ATTACKS EQUATE THE

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.741
SILENCING OF WOMEN. WOMEN ARE

00:48:30.807 --> 00:48:33.076
NOT A MONOLITHIC GROUP. WOMEN

00:48:33.143 --> 00:48:35.012
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:37.080
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR

00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:39.750
BODIES AND HOW THEY WANT TO

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:45.055
LIVE. N. AS WE FIGHT SO OFTEN

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.556
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE A

00:48:46.623 --> 00:48:48.992
RIGHT. WHY DOES IT SEEM TO BE

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:52.462
OKAY. TO DENY THE RIGHTS OF

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:55.632
WOMEN TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT HOW

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:58.702
WE WANT TO LIVE. THERE WAS A

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:01.405
REALLY GREAT OP ED. IN LAST

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.839
WEEK'S NEW YORK TIMES WRITTEN

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:05.542
BY ALEXIS MCGILL JOHNSON THE

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.377
CURRENT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:10.647
PLANNED PARENTHOOD- ACTUALLY

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:14.318
QUITE ELOQUENTLY TALKS ABOUT.

00:49:14.384 --> 00:49:16.086
PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S FOUNDING

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.523
AND ITS FOUNDER. AND NO LONGER

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:22.993
EXCUSES. THE VALUES AND

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.928
BEHAVIOR OF THAT PARTICULAR

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:30.567
PERSON. EUGENICS WRONG

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.436
AFFILIATING WITH THE KLU KLUX

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:36.440
KLAN WRONG. CENTRALIZING BLACK

00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:38.241
AND BROWN IN IMMIGRANT WOMEN

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:42.646
WRONG. BUT FOCUSING ON BODILY

00:49:42.713 --> 00:49:45.015
AUTONOMY AND SELF DETERMINATION

00:49:45.082 --> 00:49:46.783
FOR WOMEN IS SOMETHING QUITE

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.251
FRANKLY WE ALL SHOULD BE

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:52.522
SUPPORTING. FINN ABORTIONS ARE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:55.425
NOT ONE IN THE SAME. MANY FOLKS

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.594
HAVE THEM BECAUSE WHAT'S

00:49:57.661 --> 00:49:58.895
GROWING INSIDE OF THEM STOPS

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:03.967
GROWING. IT STOPS GROWING. AND

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.836
THOSE DECISIONS THAT WOMEN HAVE

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:09.106
TO MAKE. ARE PROBABLY THE ONE

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.640
DECISION THEY NEVER WANT TO

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:15.479
HAVE TO MAKE. BUT IT IS ABOT

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.948
THE HEALTH OF THE MOTHER. AND

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:18.815
THE FACTTHAT THERE IS

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:21.418
SOMETHING INSIDE OF THAT MOTHER

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.286
TO BE OR MOTHER WHO WANTED TO

00:50:23.353 --> 00:50:31.361
BE. THAT IS NOT TO GROWING.

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:36.733
THAT SCIENCE. AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.203
IT IS LIFE. SO I WOULD JUST

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:45.041
URGE US. TO NOT CONTINUE TO

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:48.545
SUGGEST THAT WOMEN ARE SECONDS.

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:49.746
AND THAT THE RIGHT FOR US TO

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:52.149
DETERMINE HOW OUR BODIES ARE

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:54.851
TREATED IN WHO HAS CONTROL OVER

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:57.654
THEM. IT'S NOT SECONDS. AND

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.790
THAT WE SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS

00:50:59.856 --> 00:51:02.626
AND CLINICS VETERAN COMMUNITY

00:51:02.692 --> 00:51:04.027
IS QUITE FRANKLY THAT NO ONE

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.562
REALLY CARES ABOUT UNTIL IT'S

00:51:05.629 --> 00:51:08.532
EXCITING. TO ALLOW THOSE

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:10.133
ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.935
CLINICS TO PROVIDE CARE THAT

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.837
OFTEN TIMES NO ONE ELSE IS

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:19.876
PROVIDING. SO I ASK. WE SUPPORT

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:22.212
SELF DETERMINATION AND BODILY

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:24.948
AUTONOMY AND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:26.950
CHOOSE AND THINK AND MAKE

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:29.052
DECISIONS FOR HERSELF BY

JUST WANT TO SHARE MY OWN

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.515
PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS

00:51:58.582 --> 00:52:00.817
MATTER AS A- AS A LATINO

00:52:00.884 --> 00:52:03.320
CATHOLIC. WHO HAS OFTEN BEEN

CATHOLIC MY POSITIONS ON. ON

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.927
ALLOWING A WOMAN'S CHOICE. AND

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.963
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OFTEN

00:52:13.029 --> 00:52:15.398
RAISED BEEN SOMEBODY

00:52:15.465 --> 00:52:17.968
PERSONALLY. THAT SUPPORTS LIFE

00:52:18.034 --> 00:52:22.072
SUPPORTS- IT I'M NOT I'M

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.974
PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:27.777
TRULY. AND THAT'S AN AREA WHERE

00:52:27.844 --> 00:52:33.049
I OFTEN STRUGGLE. BUT I LOOK AT

00:52:33.116 --> 00:52:35.118
THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF

00:52:35.185 --> 00:52:38.355
WHAT IT REALLY IS I OFTEN I

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.689
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:42.459
HEARING ARGUMENTS HOW BLESSED

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:46.496
GOVERNMENT IS MORE. AND- FROM

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.465
FROM ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE

00:52:48.532 --> 00:52:52.702
OFTEN SAYS LESS GOVERNMENT IN

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:53.270
YOUR LIFE IS BETTER WE WANT

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:56.172
FREEDOM. AND THEN WHEN I HEAR

00:52:56.239 --> 00:52:57.374
HOW THEY ARGUE FOR MORE

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.510
GOVERNMENT. IN DETERMINING

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.945
INDIVIDUAL FAMILY PLANNING I

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:03.980
CAN'T RENTS ARE RECONCILED THAT

00:53:04.047 --> 00:53:05.282
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:07.117
ME. AND WITH THIS REALLY

00:53:07.183 --> 00:53:09.853
TRANSLATES TO. IS IT WILL YOU

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.787
KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.923
IMPOSING LAWS ON LOCAL

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:13.490
GOVERNMENT THAT'S CALLED AN

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.559
UNFUNDED MANDATE. THIS IS THIS

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.527
IS AN UNFUNDED MANDATE ON ON

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:20.196
WOMEN'S LIVES. A GOVERNMENT

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:22.198
DECIDES YOU HAVE TO HAVE.

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:25.302
CHILDREN BUT DOES NOTHING. TO

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:27.137
SUPPORT THE UPBRINGING OF THOSE

00:53:27.203 --> 00:53:29.773
CHIP CHILDREN. BACKED UP BY AN

00:53:29.839 --> 00:53:31.841
IDEOLOGY OF PEOPLE THAT SAY. WE

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:34.311
SUPPORT LIFE BEFORE IT'S BORN

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.413
BUT WON IT ONCE IT'S BORN. WE

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:39.249
DON'T SUPPORT IT ANYMORE. LET

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:40.817
THOSE CHILDREN LIVE IN POVERTY.

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:42.819
LET THEM LIVE IN INEQUALITY

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:44.321
WITHOUT EQUAL ACCESS TO

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:46.590
DRINKABLE WATER WITHOUT EQUAL

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.558
ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION.

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.760
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING HERE NOT

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:56.499
PROVIDING. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

00:53:56.566 --> 00:53:58.568
FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE.

00:53:58.635 --> 00:54:00.570
AND JUST TRYING DOT TRYING TO

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:04.874
UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEBODY ON THE-

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:08.445
ONE HAND COULD SUPPORT. LIFE

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.045
BEFORE IT'S BORN BUT ONCE IT'S

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:14.484
BORN. NOT SUPPORTED AT WHEN.

00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:16.920
IT'S MOST APPROPRIATE THIS IF

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:20.724
YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS IS.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.259
THIS IS GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.462
FAMILY PLANNING THE GOVERNMENT

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:28.164
SAYING YOU MUST HAVE A CHILD

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:30.333
AND WE WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.435
HOW THAT CHILD IS RAISED

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:33.803
WHETHER IT'S PROVIDED WITH A

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.705
LITTLE HOME HEALTH CARE

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:38.274
EDUCATION. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:40.810

THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:40.670
SUPREME COURT DECISION ROE

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:42.472

JUST POINT OUT SINCE I'M

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.209
GENERALLY A DIVIDEND SPACE TO A

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:48.712
POLICY MAKER THAT ACTUALLY-

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:51.214
HERE IN CALIFORNIA- OUR

00:55:51.281 --> 00:55:53.883
POLICIES- FOR THOSE WHO SAY

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.385
THEY WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:58.421
OF ABORTIONS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN

00:55:58.488 --> 00:55:59.522
VERY SUCCESSFUL. SHE REDUCE THE

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:00.290
PORTIONS OF THE STATE OF

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.625
CALIFORNIA BY OVER 60% SINCE

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:10.033
THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. SO

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.468
I HAVE YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.769
ACTUALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:14.938
SOME WE REALLY ABOUT REDUCING

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.506
ABORTIONS YOU SHOULD BE

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:19.843
DEFINITELY FULLY IN SUPPORT OF-

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:21.878
ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION- MANY

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.113
OTHER POLICIES WELL THAT WE

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.314
HAVE PURSUED HERE IN THE STATE

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.516
OF CALIFORNIA- TO REDUCE THE

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.985
NUMBER OF ABORTIONS. HOWEVER I

00:56:29.052 --> 00:56:30.987
ALSO POINT OUT AND I KNOW THAT-

00:56:31.054 --> 00:56:32.622
THAT OTHER SEPARATE POINT ON

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.657
THE FLOOR THAT IS A POSITION I

00:56:34.724 --> 00:56:36.726
THINK THAT. MIGHT COME TO

00:56:36.793 --> 00:56:39.162
HEALTH CARE- THAT SHOULD REALLY

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:41.397
BE A DECISION BETWEEN THE-

00:56:41.464 --> 00:56:42.799
PATIENT AND THE DOCTOR

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:45.435
INDIVIDUAL THE DOCTOR. ABOUT

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:48.872
THEIR OWN HEALTH AND- YOU KNOW

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.874
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT BELIEFS.

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.410
THEY AND THE IT'S TAKEN STATION

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:55.945
SINCERELY FOLLOW THEIR OWN

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.380
BELIEFS BUT THEN THE QUESTION

00:56:57.447 --> 00:57:02.685
IS DO WE AS GOVERNMENT IMPOSE-

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:03.853
THESE RULES TO RESTRICT

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.088
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL CHOICES

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:06.623
ESPECIALLY THOSE CHOICES DON'T

00:57:06.689 --> 00:57:09.025
AFFECT. THE HEALTH OF THE

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:13.062
PEOPLE AROUND THEM. AND- SO. I

00:57:13.129 --> 00:57:14.597
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:19.235
RECOGNIZE THAT- WE SHOULD NOT

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:21.971
BE INTERFERING IN THIS WAY IN

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:23.673
THE PRIVATE PERSONAL DECISIONS

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.309
OF WOMEN. THAT EVERY PERSON HAS

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.577
THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:28.211
THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:30.446
DECISIONS THAT INCLUDES ACCESS

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:32.315
TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NOW

00:57:32.382 --> 00:57:32.882
INCLUDES ABORTIONS WHICH IS

00:57:32.949 --> 00:57:35.885
HEALTHCARE. AND SO CERTAINLY I

00:57:35.952 --> 00:57:37.654
THINK THAT FOR THOSE WHO WANT

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.388
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

00:57:38.454 --> 00:57:39.522
ABORTIONS WE SHOULD CONTINUE

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:40.623
SUPPORT POLICIES THAT WE

00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.625
PURSUED HERE TO SEE THE

00:57:42.692 --> 00:57:43.159
CALIFORNIA WHICH HAVE BEEN

00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:44.594
SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO. AND

00:57:44.661 --> 00:57:46.095
CERTAINLY WE NEED TO ENSURE

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.931
THAT OUR CONSTITUTION.

00:57:47.997 --> 00:57:49.365
CONTINUES TO PROTECT THE

00:57:49.432 --> 00:57:53.002
PRIVACY. OF THE PEOPLE OF THE

00:57:53.069 --> 00:57:54.971
WHOLE COUNTRY THE EXPOSITION OF

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.706
ROE VERSUS WADE. RESPECTFULLY

00:57:56.773 --> 00:57:58.641
ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT PRESS ARE

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:01.144
SIX THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:05.181
FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:07.283
SINGMAN CENTER SKINNER YOU MAY

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.185
CONCLUDE. THANK YOU MADAM

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:18.528
PRESIDENT. THESE TOPICS I

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:20.997
SUPPOSE SOME OF US MAY AT TIMES

00:58:21.064 --> 00:58:23.533
WANT TO SKIRT BRINGING FORWARD

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.936
CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES- AND

00:58:27.003 --> 00:58:29.739
HAVING DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE

00:58:29.806 --> 00:58:32.308
VERY PERSONAL VERY SENSITIVE

00:58:32.375 --> 00:58:35.345
AND FOR MANY VERY EMOTIONAL.

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.480
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.148
SOMETIMES HAVE THESE DEBATES

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:44.687
BECAUSE. WHAT I WOULD ASSERT IS

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.856
THAT WE CAN NO WAY. FOR TO

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:51.561
UNDERSTAND. WHY WHAT GOES

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.463
THROUGH ONE'S MIND WHAT ARE THE

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.764
FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED HER

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:57.800
DECISION. WHEN SHE CHOOSES

00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.235
EITHER TO PROCEED WITH THE

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:02.772
PREGNANCY OR TO ABORT. AND THAT

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.807
IS REALLY WITH THE BRILLIANCE

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:06.442
AND IMPORTANCE OF THE COURT'S

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:09.512
RULING IS IN ROE VERSUS WADE.

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:12.448
IS THAT IT GAVE WOMEN. AGENCY

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:15.051
OVER THEIR BODIES AGENCY OVER

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.754
THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES IT

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.858
DOES NOT IMPOSE ABORTION. IT

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:25.361
DOES NOT IMPOSE THAT SOMEONE

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:27.163
PROCEED WITH THE PREGNANCY

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:29.966
RATHER IT GIVES THE WOMAN THE

00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:34.070
WOMAN THE ABILITY TO DECIDE.

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:37.206
NOW IT IS INTERESTING. THE

00:59:37.273 --> 00:59:37.740
EVOLUTION OF THE POLITICAL

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:41.978
VIEWPOINTS ON THIS ISSUE. IN

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:43.880
FACT IT IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:46.215
THROUGHOUT THE SIXTIES AND PART

00:59:46.282 --> 00:59:48.151
IN GOOD PART OF THE SEVENTIES.

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:51.888
WHO WAS OVERALL FAR STRONGER

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:52.522
PRO CHOICE THAN THE DEMOCRATIC

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:56.559
PARTY. THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:59.195
REVERSED ITSELF SOME OVERTIME.

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.965
BUT THE ISSUE FOR ME IT'S NOT

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:05.134
AN IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE. MY STRONG

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:07.236
BELIEF IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO

01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:08.938
HAVE AGENCY OVER HER BODY AND

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.240
HER REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES HAS

01:00:11.307 --> 01:00:14.410
NOTHING TO DO WITH ALL IDEOLOGY

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.946
IT'S ABOUT PERSONAL EXERCISE IN

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:20.817
THE SAME WAY. THAT WE DO NOT AS

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:21.918
A GOVERNMENT IMPOSED

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.486
INTERFERENCE ON THE EXERCISE OF

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.154
PERSONAL CHOICE REGARDING ONE'S

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:29.792
RELIGIOUS VIEWS. OR EVEN ONES

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:35.331
POLITICAL VIEWS. THE

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:37.567
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR WHICH A

01:00:37.633 --> 01:00:40.470

THEIR HEALTH IS IMPACTED IT MAY

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.908

THEY GOT PREGNANT. OR MAYBE ANY

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:51.114
OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS. BUT

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.783
THAT IS THE WOMAN'S RIGHT. AND

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.452
THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:00:56.519 --> 01:00:58.955

I ALSO RISE TO ADJOURN IN

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:57.506
MEMORY OF JIM MOLAN I SERVE THE

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.141
SAME SIX YEARS IN THE STATE

01:17:59.207 --> 01:18:01.276
ASSEMBLY AS JANE DID IN THE

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:04.546
SAME CLASS. HE WAS KNOWN AS WAS

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.515
NOTED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.717
CHRONICLE MEMORIAL AS THE CAL

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:10.419
RIPKEN OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.553
BECAUSE HE NEVER MISSED A

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:13.422
SINGLE VOTE ON THE FLOOR OR THE

01:18:13.488 --> 01:18:16.425
COMMITTEE DURING HIS SIX YEARS.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:20.796
IN WHAT WAS. USUALLY A VERY

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:23.965
RAMBUNCTIOUS HOUSE. HE WAS THE

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:26.134
ADULTS YOU COULD TELL THAT HE

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:28.103
HAD BEEN A COACH AT A HIGH

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.671
SCHOOL TEACHER FOR OVER THREE

01:18:29.738 --> 01:18:30.939
DECADES BY THE WAY HE

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:35.010
NAVIGATED. OF THAT SYSTEM. IT A

01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.012
VERY DRY SENSE OF HUMOR. WE

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:38.547
WERE ONCE BOTH CALLED TO THE

01:18:38.613 --> 01:18:40.549
SPEAKER'S OFFICE AS FIRST

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:41.716
TIMERS AND I REMEMBER HE SAID

01:18:41.783 --> 01:18:43.318
TO ME. THIS IS LIKE BEING

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:44.653
CALLED TO THE DEAN OF BOYS

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:47.022
OFFICE. WHEN WE WENT TO TURNED

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:50.358
OUT TO- THE OTHER SIDE WAS

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:51.326
GOING TO PRESENT A BUDGET

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:53.228
PROPOSAL AND HE WANTED THE TWO

01:18:53.295 --> 01:18:56.431
OF US TO GO IN AND LISTEN AND

01:18:56.498 --> 01:18:59.000
THEN GO OUTSIDE AND RESPOND ON

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.069
BEHALF OF THE HOUSE. WE DID

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.071
THAT AND I THOUGHT I GAVE A

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:06.374
GREAT ARTICULATE ANALYSIS OF

01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:08.643
THE BUDGET AND THEN JEANS COM

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:11.079
WE JUST LOOKED AT THE SCRUM OF

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:12.981
REPORTERS AND SAID THE GOOD

01:19:13.048 --> 01:19:14.216
THING SO MANY PRISONERS ARE

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:15.817
BEING LET OUT EARLY BECAUSE ALL

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.552
BE OUT ON THE SIDEWALKS WITH

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.988
THE KINDERGARTENERS. AND IT WAS

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:21.056
ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WE

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:23.458
COULDN'T HELP YOURSELF JUST

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:26.361
LAUGHED OUT LOUD. I DID IN THE

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.396
MEMORIES FOR A LOCAL TEACHER

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:29.865
WHO WAS A LONGTIME CITY COUNCIL

01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.534
MEMBER. AND HE WALKED OVER AND

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.470
SAID- I KNEW ROOF AND JUST WENT

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.572
THROUGH A FRIENDSHIP. HE WAS

01:19:37.639 --> 01:19:39.407
JUST CLEARLY SOMEBODY THAT.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.309
KNEW HIS COLLEAGUES AND WAS

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.312
BELOVED. AND THEN THERE WAS

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:45.847
THIS TIME WHEN WE EACH HAD

01:19:45.914 --> 01:19:47.249
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS IN OUR OWN

01:19:47.315 --> 01:19:52.254
DISTRICT. I HAD A HORRIBLE BILL

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.421
THAT FLEW OUT OF THE STATE

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.856
SENATE SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:58.026
HAPPEN ANYMORE- I KNOW. THAT

01:19:58.093 --> 01:19:59.060
WOULD HAVE REMOVED ALL THE

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.729
LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ON ON

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.664
BOARD AND REPLACE THEM WITH A

01:20:02.731 --> 01:20:05.967
WHOLE NEW GROUP OF PEOPLE. JEAN

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:07.802
REVERSED HIMSELF WAS THE SWING

01:20:07.869 --> 01:20:10.472
VOTE IN KILLING THAT BILL. AND

01:20:10.539 --> 01:20:12.340
THEN LO AND BEHOLD HE HAD A

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:15.310
CITY IN HIS DISTRICT THAT ARE

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.011
ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:17.913
JUDGMENT AGAINST IT ON A LAND

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.548
USE MEASURE IT WAS A CITY THAT

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.815
WAS VERY SMALL. AND HE HAD A

01:20:20.882 --> 01:20:24.252
BILL THAT WOULD HAVE FIXED IT

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.054
THAT THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS JUST

01:20:26.121 --> 01:20:28.790
HATE I DIDN'T LIKE THE BILL BUT

01:20:28.857 --> 01:20:30.258
