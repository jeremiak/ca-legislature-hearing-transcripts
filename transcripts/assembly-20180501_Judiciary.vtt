00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:05.263 region:rollup2
LEAD BASED PAINT ALWAYS HAS THE

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:07.665 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL TO BE UNSAFE IN THE

00:46:05.263 --> 00:46:09.300 region:rollup2
FUTURE IF IT DETERIORATES. BUT

00:46:07.665 --> 00:46:11.235 region:rollup2
ISN'T THIS TRUE OF ALMOST EVERY

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.737 region:rollup2
PRODUCT IN YOUR HOME.

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:14.538 region:rollup2
IF ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE

CARPETING THAT ISN'T TACK DOWN

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:17.908 region:rollup2
TO LEAD TO FALLS IN BROKEN HIPS

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:19.343 region:rollup2
NATURAL GAS HEATING THAT LEAKS

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:23.581 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY GOES BEYOND THE CASE

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:12.363 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSE.

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:12.997 region:rollup2

ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS LIABILITY BUT

00:47:30.548 --> 00:47:33.951 region:rollup2
IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE

LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT.

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:37.254 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE ASSIGNING LIABILITY

ENTIRE. PAINT INDUSTRY.

CYNICAL.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:21.732 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO GET OUT FROM

BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND A

00:49:18.355 --> 00:49:20.257 region:rollup2
A CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND FROM THE

00:49:19.957 --> 00:49:22.193 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION.

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:23.027 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:49:22.193 --> 00:49:24.562 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S.

00:49:23.027 --> 00:49:25.830 region:rollup2
THEIR NOT SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING

00:49:24.562 --> 00:49:27.465 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THIS FORWARD.

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.933 region:rollup2
.

00:49:27.465 --> 00:49:30.868 region:rollup2
BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S

00:49:28.933 --> 00:49:32.336 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE THAT COULD COMPLETELY

00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:33.237 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE LIABILITY THESE

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:34.939 region:rollup2
THREE COMPANIES.

00:49:33.237 --> 00:49:36.474 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE

00:49:34.939 --> 00:49:38.142 region:rollup2
AUTHOR FEELS LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT

00:49:36.474 --> 00:49:40.044 region:rollup2
FOR WITH THIS AND.

00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.611 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THE

00:49:40.044 --> 00:49:42.313 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION IF THE INITIATIVE

00:49:40.611 --> 00:49:47.284 region:rollup2
PASSES.

00:49:42.313 --> 00:49:48.953 region:rollup2
OF WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO.

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:50.855 region:rollup2
JOINT HAPPY FOR C. MTA I

00:49:48.953 --> 00:49:51.655 region:rollup2
APOLOGIZE I'M NOT PREPARED TO

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:52.490 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO THE INITIATIVE SEEMED

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:54.191 region:rollup2
HAY.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.359 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:56.660 region:rollup2
WITH YOU OFFLINE SO I THINK I

00:49:55.359 --> 00:49:58.295 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.897 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A

00:49:58.295 --> 00:50:00.998 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WITH THE THREE

00:49:59.897 --> 00:50:03.868 region:rollup2
COMPANIES BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE

00:50:00.998 --> 00:50:04.935 region:rollup2
TODAY. UMP THEY'VE SENT YOU.

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:05.870 region:rollup2

PERSPECTIVE.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:09.673 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS WHY I THINK WE HAVE

00:50:08.105 --> 00:50:10.140 region:rollup2
WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.042 region:rollup2
THIS ENTAILS NOW IF I

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:13.544 region:rollup2

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:15.045 region:rollup2
YOUR ONLY REPRESENTING ONE OF

00:50:13.544 --> 00:50:16.914 region:rollup2
THE THREE COMPANIES BUT YOU'RE

00:50:15.045 --> 00:50:19.884 region:rollup2
NOT ASSOCIATE YOURSELF WITH THE

00:50:16.914 --> 00:50:21.352 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE AT THIS TIME RIGHT.

00:50:19.884 --> 00:50:23.420 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT. THAT QUESTIONS

00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:24.488 region:rollup2

WELL OKAY AND AND MY

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.062 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPPOSITION

ARGUMENT IS.

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:35.232 region:rollup2
YOU BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE

00:50:33.597 --> 00:50:37.501 region:rollup2

00:51:18.976 --> 00:51:21.111 region:rollup2

00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:23.380 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT A QUESTION I CAN

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:52.556 region:rollup2
FIRST IT CALLS OUT THE PRESENCE

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:54.391 region:rollup2
OF LEAD PAINT FOR WHAT IT IS.

00:54:52.556 --> 00:54:56.393 region:rollup2
A POISON THAT IS A DAMAGE TO

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:57.794 region:rollup2
PROPERTY AND A HEALTH HAZARD.

00:54:56.393 --> 00:54:59.129 region:rollup2
THE MERE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.864 region:rollup2
IN OUR WALLS IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:03.100 region:rollup2
CONCERN BECAUSE ANY DISTURBANCE

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:05.068 region:rollup2
CAN FLAKE LET US INTO THE AIR.

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.403 region:rollup2

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:07.938 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:09.773 region:rollup2
THIS MUST BE DEALT WITH

EVENTUALLY AND EVERY HOME.

00:55:09.773 --> 00:55:13.410 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AS PROPERTIES BUILT

TO TAKE ACTION.

00:55:28.859 --> 00:55:31.662 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF STARTING

00:55:30.394 --> 00:55:33.030 region:rollup2
THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TO

PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AFTER

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.533 region:rollup2
SIGNING A VAGUE DISCLOSURE FORM

00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:38.735 region:rollup2
IS UNREASONABLE.

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:39.636 region:rollup2
THE PRESUMPTION THAT LEADS.

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:41.371 region:rollup2

THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO.

00:59:11.882 --> 00:59:15.385 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE LOAD RIGHTS OF

LEVELS IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER.

00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:22.926 region:rollup2
AND THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT

00:59:22.159 --> 00:59:24.728 region:rollup2
DIMINISHING

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:25.896 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THERE'D BEEN OVER

00:59:24.728 --> 00:59:27.364 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN

00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:28.432 region:rollup2
REPORTED ANNUALLY WITH ELEVATED

00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:29.499 region:rollup2
BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OF THE PAST

00:59:28.432 --> 00:59:31.134 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS AGAIN THESE

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:33.236 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE NOT DIMINISHING. AND

00:59:31.134 --> 00:59:34.638 region:rollup2
THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CHILDREN IN

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:36.473 region:rollup2
THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE NEW TO

00:59:34.638 --> 00:59:37.908 region:rollup2
THESE HOMES ARE LIVING IN HOMES

00:59:36.473 --> 00:59:39.876 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PAINTED WITH WITH

00:59:37.908 --> 00:59:41.478 region:rollup2
LEADED PAINT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:42.979 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

00:59:41.478 --> 00:59:44.114 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE

00:59:42.979 --> 00:59:45.282 region:rollup2
HAZARDS THAT THEY'RE MOVING INTO

00:59:44.114 --> 00:59:46.683 region:rollup2
AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC

00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:48.285 region:rollup2
MEANS TO ADDRESS THOSE OR TO

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:49.686 region:rollup2
MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOMES.

00:59:48.285 --> 00:59:51.488 region:rollup2
AND SO THE EXPOSURES ARE

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:53.790 region:rollup2
PERSISTENT IN THEIR ON GOING IN

00:59:51.488 --> 00:59:55.292 region:rollup2
THE VERY VERY WIDESPREAD.

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.860 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE DAMAGE COSTS

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:57.794 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S BRAINS IS PERMANENT

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.196 region:rollup2
AND THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL

00:59:57.794 --> 01:00:00.397 region:rollup2
OF EXPOSURE TO LOOK FOR CHILD

00:59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.798 region:rollup2
THE ONLY REASONABLE COURSE OF

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.732 region:rollup2
ACTION IS PREVENTION. AND WHEN

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:04.067 region:rollup2
IT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH LET

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:05.502 region:rollup2

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.903 region:rollup2

CONTAINMENT.

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.207 region:rollup2
SO IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE TALKING

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.174 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE IS IRREVERSIBLE

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:12.609 region:rollup2

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.809 region:rollup2
IF THAT DISCLOSURE IS

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:26.743 region:rollup2
MEANINGLESS THEN EXIT SIMPLY WHY

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.044 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE IT.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.012 region:rollup2
IF IT DOESN'T CREATE KNOWLEDGE

01:02:28.044 --> 01:02:29.980 region:rollup2
AND SO WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:31.681 region:rollup2
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:33.516 region:rollup2

01:02:39.055 --> 01:02:42.125 region:rollup2
REMEDIATE. THE POTENTIAL HAZARD

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:43.193 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH DAMAGES

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.427 region:rollup2
THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE

01:02:43.193 --> 01:02:45.462 region:rollup2
DAMAGES WILL BE UTILIZED TO

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:48.565 region:rollup2
ABATE THE HAZARD SO WE HAVE

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:49.199 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:49.399 region:rollup2

THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT ARE THE

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:59.643 region:rollup2
BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION ISN'T

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.777 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CLEAR DANGER OF LEAD

01:02:59.643 --> 01:03:02.779 region:rollup2
AND LEAD PAINT.

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.547 region:rollup2
WHICH WHILE ONCE WAS CONSIDERED

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.782 region:rollup2
AN INDUSTRY STANDARD AND IS IN

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:07.484 region:rollup2

01:03:08.051 --> 01:03:11.721 region:rollup2
A IT WE'VE NOW LEARNED THAT

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:13.390 region:rollup2
IT'S CLEAR ON AND DANGEROUS

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:15.725 region:rollup2
HEALTH EFFECTS ARE.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:17.360 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED SO THE ISSUE

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:18.828 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE

DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF THEORIES

01:03:48.525 --> 01:03:51.361 region:rollup2
FOR DEALING WITH THAT.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:53.363 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT THAT THE

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:55.231 region:rollup2

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2

01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:57.006 region:rollup2
TO IT. AS YOU INDICATED YOUR SON

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:57.840 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS THE WINDOWSILL AND

01:07:57.006 --> 01:07:59.242 region:rollup2
THE WALLS.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.543 region:rollup2
IF IT CHIPS OR FLAKES THE COULD

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.778 region:rollup2
INGEST IT WHEN THEY'RE AROUND ON

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:03.513 region:rollup2
THE ON THE FLOOR.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:04.647 region:rollup2
THIS IT DOESN'T LIMIT IT TO

01:08:03.513 --> 01:08:06.282 region:rollup2
INTERIOR PAINT WHERE THEY'VE

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:07.917 region:rollup2
SEEN THE HEALTH HAZARD AND IT

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:09.185 region:rollup2
THE EXTERIOR PAINT THEY I DIDN'T

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.553 region:rollup2
FIND ENOUGH EVIDENCE AFTER

01:08:09.185 --> 01:08:11.421 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION TO

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:12.855 region:rollup2
SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BE A

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.357 region:rollup2
HEALTH HAZARD.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:15.391 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD DEEM IT UP

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:16.859 region:rollup2
INJURY TO THE PROPERTY BECAUSE

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:17.994 region:rollup2
THERE IS TOO MANY EXTERIOR BY

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:20.697 region:rollup2
MENTAL ISSUES AND CONDITIONS

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:23.066 region:rollup2
THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE. ONTO THE.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:25.034 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF LEAD WITH REGARDS TO

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:26.202 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE THE HOME OUTSIDE THE

01:08:25.034 --> 01:08:27.837 region:rollup2
INTERIOR AND SO THAT WAS OUR

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:29.472 region:rollup2
POSITION IS THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:30.773 region:rollup2
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INTERIOR AND

01:08:29.472 --> 01:08:32.175 region:rollup2
EXTERIOR FOR PURPOSES OF

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:33.376 region:rollup2
DETERMINING WHEN AND IT'S A

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:34.310 region:rollup2
ENTRY TO THE PROPERTY. GENETIC

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:35.211 region:rollup2
WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.914 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:39.549 region:rollup2
THATCH ONE THAT WAS EXPERIENCED

01:08:37.914 --> 01:08:40.450 region:rollup2
DURING THE EIGHTEEN LAWSUIT WAS

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:41.818 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IT WAS

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.187 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO PROVE.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:45.622 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT HARM CHILDREN WHO

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:47.290 region:rollup2
ARE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:48.358 region:rollup2
HOW THEIR AND JUST TO LET A

01:08:47.290 --> 01:08:49.659 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXACTLY MY

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.259 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHY THE AUTHOR

01:08:49.659 --> 01:08:50.994 region:rollup2
WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:54.097 region:rollup2
IT.

01:08:50.994 --> 01:08:55.365 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR UP FOR

01:08:54.097 --> 01:08:56.833 region:rollup2
TO BE PROVEN BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:08:55.365 --> 01:08:58.334 region:rollup2
COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT

01:08:56.833 --> 01:09:00.269 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WERE PLAYING RIGHT

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:01.237 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE HOUSES. ARE JUST AS WHEN

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.772 region:rollup2
THEY'RE ON THE INSIDE OF THE

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.040 region:rollup2
HOUSE MIGHT BE JUST AND LEAD THE

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:05.041 region:rollup2
ON THE OUTS ON THE OUTSIDE THE

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.609 region:rollup2
HOUSE MIGHT BE DOING THE SAME SO

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:07.310 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT I THINK WE WOULD

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.211 region:rollup2
MAYBE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.946 region:rollup2
OPINION ON THAT BUT BUCKLEY

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.847 region:rollup2
DISAGREED BUT YES BUT YOU'RE NOT

01:09:09.946 --> 01:09:12.482 region:rollup2
DISPUTING.

01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:15.852 region:rollup2
THE PORTION THIS BILL HAVING TO

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:16.719 region:rollup2
DO WITH ACTUAL HARM IS WHAT I

01:09:15.852 --> 01:09:17.720 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THOUGHT I'D HEARD FROM.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:19.188 region:rollup2
FROM YOU SO SO THAT ASPECT OF

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.757 region:rollup2
THE BILL YOU'RE FINE WITH NO WE

01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:22.558 region:rollup2
ARE JUST DISCUSSING BETWEEN TORT

01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:24.060 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:25.294 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY AND SUBJECT PLEASE.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.996 region:rollup2
REVIEWED DON'T WANNA AND

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.997 region:rollup2
DOMINATE BUT OF THE ISSUE WITH

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:29.666 region:rollup2
REGARD TO CONSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.566 region:rollup2
VERSUS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.301 region:rollup2
THAT DISCLOSURE THAT YOU'RE IN A

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:33.536 region:rollup2
PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOME

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.471 region:rollup2
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CLEAN.

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:36.272 region:rollup2
HAVE LEAD PAINT AND IT WHETHER

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.840 region:rollup2
OR NOT THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT YOU

01:09:36.272 --> 01:09:39.709 region:rollup2
ON NOTICE I'M THAT YOU NEED TO

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.378 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING CHOIR AS NORMAL

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:43.379 region:rollup2
TIGHTLIPPED TORT LIABILITY

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:45.114 region:rollup2
REQUIRES A BIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:46.949 region:rollup2
YET I THINK THAT THE ISSUE ABOUT

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:48.284 region:rollup2
HARM IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO YOU

01:09:46.949 --> 01:09:50.686 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT KIDS ARE NOT

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:52.522 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO LEAD PAINT. ON A

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:53.556 region:rollup2
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DEBORAH

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:55.024 region:rollup2
TEASES THE ONE WHO CARRIED THE

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:57.226 region:rollup2
BILL THAT SAID IF YOU ACTUALLY

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:59.195 region:rollup2
REMEDIATE AND COVER ENCAPSULATE

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.629 region:rollup2
THE LEAD. SO THAT IT IS NOT A

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.631 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:03.966 region:rollup2
THAT IS HOW YOU.

01:10:01.631 --> 01:10:06.669 region:rollup2
UP PREVENTED SO I THINK THAT

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:08.471 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS ON WANTS TO.

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:10.640 region:rollup2
TRY TO PUT FORTH A BILL THAT

01:10:08.471 --> 01:10:12.208 region:rollup2
SAYS AUTOMATICALLY THE PRESENCE

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.477 region:rollup2
OF ANY LEAD IN A IN A.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:16.045 region:rollup2
AND ANY ONE DROP OF LEAD IN THE

01:10:14.477 --> 01:10:17.513 region:rollup2
HOUSE IS A HEALTH HAZARD IS AN

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.815 region:rollup2
ISSUE WHEN THERE'S LEAD IN THE

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.750 region:rollup2
SOIL THERE'S LET YOUR

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:22.618 region:rollup2
STRAWBERRIES THERE'S LEAD. ON IN

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.921 region:rollup2
YOUR TOYS ON THAT THAT'S WHERE

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:26.355 region:rollup2
WE GET ON A TO OUR DISAGREEMENTS

01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:27.390 region:rollup2
ARE IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:29.192 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:30.827 region:rollup2
WAIT TO HAVE KIDS. EXPOSED TO

01:10:29.192 --> 01:10:32.228 region:rollup2
LEAD POISONING IT'S ABOUT THERE

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:34.597 region:rollup2
ARE MANY WAYS TO.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:36.866 region:rollup2
TRY AND MITIGATE THE HEALTH

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:37.900 region:rollup2
IMPACTS OF LEAD AND WE DON'T

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:40.369 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT STATUTORILY MAKING

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:42.205 region:rollup2
IT. ANY OUNCE OF LEAD ANYWHERE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:45.074 region:rollup2
IN THE HOUSE AS A THE OFFICIAL

01:10:42.205 --> 01:10:46.275 region:rollup2
DAMAGE THAT CAN BE SUED OVER. IS

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.410 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT REMEDY.

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:48.478 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN A AND I'LL ASK A

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:49.912 region:rollup2
QUESTION THAT I ASKED BEFORE.

01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:51.948 region:rollup2
.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:53.416 region:rollup2
SO. I HANDFUL LEAD PAINT

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:54.817 region:rollup2
COMPANIES MADE BILLIONS OF

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:56.619 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SELLING

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:59.021 region:rollup2
PAINT WITH LEAD IN IT THAT THEY

01:10:56.619 --> 01:11:00.656 region:rollup2
KNEW WERE GONNA HARM CHILDREN.

01:10:59.021 --> 01:11:02.592 region:rollup2
AND ENTIRE GENERATIONS OF

01:11:00.656 --> 01:11:04.026 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WERE HARMED AND UNDER

01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:06.062 region:rollup2
YOUR LEGAL THEORY THEY WOULD NOT

01:11:04.026 --> 01:11:07.630 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO BE HELD LIABLE.

01:11:06.062 --> 01:11:08.965 region:rollup2
I DISAGREE WITH THAT GUIDE THE

01:11:07.630 --> 01:11:10.233 region:rollup2
COURT UNDER THE EIGHTEEN YEARS

01:11:08.965 --> 01:11:11.300 region:rollup2
OF LITIGATION THERE'S A BILLION

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:13.069 region:rollup2
DOLLAR ABATEMENT FUND AGAINST

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.170 region:rollup2
THOSE THREE COMPANIES UNDER THE

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:15.605 region:rollup2
THEORY PUBLIC NUISANCE TO

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:17.306 region:rollup2
OVERRIDE OUR ELIMINATE THE

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:19.475 region:rollup2
HEALTH HAZARDS. ASSOCIATED WITH

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:21.043 region:rollup2
INTERIOR INTERIOR PAINT USING

01:11:19.475 --> 01:11:23.045 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL HOMES WHICH ALL OF

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:23.913 region:rollup2
THE DATA AND JOURNAL AND ALL OF

01:11:23.045 --> 01:11:26.249 region:rollup2
THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THAT

01:11:23.913 --> 01:11:28.351 region:rollup2
CASE FOCUSED ON IT AND DIGITAL

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:29.919 region:rollup2
CRIBS TOYS. ALMOND WINDOWSILLS

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:30.887 region:rollup2
AS BEING THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:32.555 region:rollup2
LEAD EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN STONE

01:11:30.887 --> 01:11:33.489 region:rollup2
IN HIS POINT YOU'RE SUPPORTING

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.390 region:rollup2
THAT COURT CASE.

01:11:33.489 --> 01:11:35.825 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE QUIRKY

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:37.627 region:rollup2
SOME JUST YOUR YOUR COMMENT AS

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:39.262 region:rollup2
IF I APPRECIATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:11:37.627 --> 01:11:40.429 region:rollup2
WAS THAT WE'RE SUGGEST NATION TO

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:41.597 region:rollup2
BE HELD LIABLE AND I'M NOT

01:11:40.429 --> 01:11:43.499 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT AT ALL I'M JUST

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:44.834 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING THAT. THIS GOES

01:11:43.499 --> 01:11:47.136 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT TO INCLUDE EXTERIOR

01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:48.805 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL PAINT AND LIMITS BE

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.072 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE THAT IS

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.474 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IN NORMAL TORT

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:52.408 region:rollup2
LIABILITY SO OUR CHALLENGE

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.409 region:rollup2
THOUGH IS.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:55.011 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE OF US WHO THINK THE

01:11:53.409 --> 01:11:55.645 region:rollup2
COURT CASE OUGHT TO STAND WE

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:57.146 region:rollup2
HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT'S

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:58.080 region:rollup2
ABOUT TO NEGATE IT.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:59.982 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.684 region:rollup2
WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN.

01:11:59.982 --> 01:12:01.951 region:rollup2
MY PERSPECTIVE IS WELL A COUPLE

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:03.319 region:rollup2
OF THINGS.

01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.387 region:rollup2
I'M NOT.

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.488 region:rollup2
WEHAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON

01:12:04.387 --> 01:12:06.889 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT INITIATIVE BUT I AM

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:08.558 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR WITH IT AND.

01:12:06.889 --> 01:12:09.992 region:rollup2
IT PROPOSES FROM MY

01:12:08.558 --> 01:12:11.594 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING PLEASE CORRECT ME

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.428 region:rollup2
IF I'M WRONG BUT PROPOSES A BOND

01:12:11.594 --> 01:12:13.229 region:rollup2
IN WHICH TO.

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:15.064 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE.

01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:16.732 region:rollup2
HEALTH HAZARDS INCLUDING LEAD

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:18.367 region:rollup2
PAINT AND IT SUGGESTS THAT A LED

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:19.302 region:rollup2
PENA HOME IS NOT A PUBLIC

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.970 region:rollup2
NUISANCE IF THE VOTERS APPROVED

01:12:19.302 --> 01:12:21.938 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:23.105 region:rollup2
VOTERS THAT THEY DON'T AGREE

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:24.340 region:rollup2
WITH THE COURT CASE IN THAT THEY

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:25.274 region:rollup2
DON'T AGREE. THAT THEY SHOULD

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.976 region:rollup2
MOVE FOUR DOES A PUBLIC NUISANCE

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.977 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:29.045 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT

01:12:27.977 --> 01:12:30.947 region:rollup2
TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE VOTERS

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:31.881 region:rollup2
APPROVE OF THAT THEORY OR NOT

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:33.950 region:rollup2
AND THEN COME BACK AND DEAL WITH

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:35.218 region:rollup2
IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. IT

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.352 region:rollup2
COULD BE THAT THE VOTERS MAY BE.

01:12:35.218 --> 01:12:37.854 region:rollup2
DECEIVED ABOUT WHAT THIS

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:39.655 region:rollup2
MEASURES ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:41.290 region:rollup2
IS ALLOWING THREE TOXIC PAINT

01:12:39.655 --> 01:12:43.326 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TO ESCAPE THEIR

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:45.494 region:rollup2
BILLION ONE POINT ONE BILLION

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:47.496 region:rollup2
DOLLAR LIABILITY. WITH ONE LINE

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:48.664 region:rollup2
IN THAT INITIATIVE THAT

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:50.166 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES WHAT IT TOOK EIGHTEEN

MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED THE

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.289 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.992 region:rollup2

NUISANCE.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.233 region:rollup2

WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED REALLY

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.970 region:rollup2
WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OUTRAGED

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:29.739 region:rollup2
AT THE COURT DECISION ACCORDING

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:32.008 region:rollup2

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:57.1000 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY CAUSED THE INJURY.

01:23:56.565 --> 01:23:58.433 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY HEALTH

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:00.335 region:rollup2

INDIVIDUAL WITH REGARDS TO

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:05.407 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE TO LEAD BASED PAINT WE

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:06.708 region:rollup2
HAVE A HUGE CONCERN OF THE FACT

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:08.343 region:rollup2
THAT IT UNDERMINES THE WHOLE

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:10.445 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE OF TORT LIABILITY AND

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:11.780 region:rollup2
HOLDING IN THE COMPANY. UP

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.848 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:13.415 region:rollup2
A PRODUCT THAT THEY HAVE CREATED

01:24:12.848 --> 01:24:15.050 region:rollup2
AND THE INJURIES THAT THAT

01:24:13.415 --> 01:24:16.451 region:rollup2
PRODUCT HAS COST

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.353 region:rollup2
AND IF WE CAN GO THROUGH I CAN

01:24:16.451 --> 01:24:19.788 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON HOW WE READ THE BILL

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.923 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE READ HOW BROAD THE

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.424 region:rollup2
EXPOSURE IS UP FOR LIABILITY IN

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:23.492 region:rollup2
THIS BILL.

01:24:22.424 --> 01:24:24.860 region:rollup2
IT'S BEYOND THE RISK MAP A

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:26.261 region:rollup2
LIABILITY DOCTRINE THAT HAS BEEN

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:27.796 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS IT'S

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:29.164 region:rollup2
BEYOND MARKET SHARE LIABILITY

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:30.699 region:rollup2
THAT'S DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:32.501 region:rollup2
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. AYE

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:34.236 region:rollup2
REFERENCE TO ANY PROPOSAL OF

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:35.504 region:rollup2
SUCH EXTREME TORT LIABILITY AS

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:36.872 region:rollup2
PROPOSED IN AB TWENTY SEVENTY

01:24:35.504 --> 01:24:38.574 region:rollup2
FOUR SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:39.942 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF THE BILL. IT SAYS

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:41.910 region:rollup2
THAT ANY DISTRIBUTOR

01:24:39.942 --> 01:24:44.079 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURER OR ANYBODY WHO

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:46.048 region:rollup2
PROMOTED THE TYPE OF LEAD

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.815 region:rollup2
PIGMENT THAT CAUSE THE INJURY

01:24:46.048 --> 01:24:48.183 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:49.584 region:rollup2
THE PLANE PASSED TO ESTABLISH.

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:51.920 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:53.155 region:rollup2
SO UNDER THE PROPOSAL A BILL IT

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.456 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT YOU HAD TO

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:56.158 region:rollup2
HAVE IT MANUFACTURED SOLD

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:58.827 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED BY

01:24:56.158 --> 01:24:59.728 region:rollup2
PIGMENT IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.462 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO SATISFY THEIR BURDEN

01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:02.030 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE KEY

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:03.465 region:rollup2
ROVISIONS ARE KEY ISSUES IN THE

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:04.633 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING LITIGATION.

01:25:03.465 --> 01:25:06.201 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO IF YOU DON'T

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:07.436 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS THE

01:25:06.201 --> 01:25:08.537 region:rollup2
ACTUAL LEAD PAINT PIGMENT.

01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:10.472 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:11.006 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURED OR PROMOTED IN

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:11.840 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT CAUSED THE

01:25:11.006 --> 01:25:13.609 region:rollup2
INJURY.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.743 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY SHOW

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:16.078 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MANUFACTURED

01:25:14.743 --> 01:25:18.080 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED LED

01:25:16.078 --> 01:25:20.115 region:rollup2
PIGMENT FOR PURPOSES AB IN LEAD

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:21.249 region:rollup2
BASED PAINT INSIDE A HOME.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.217 region:rollup2
THERE'S ACTUALLY LED PIGMENT WAS

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:23.552 region:rollup2
UTILIZED FOR A NUMBER OF

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:25.087 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REASONS CERAMICS

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:26.788 region:rollup2
OPINION ON SHIPS OPINION ON

01:25:25.087 --> 01:25:28.090 region:rollup2
BRIDGES THERE IS NO INDICATION

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.524 region:rollup2
THAT ALL LEAD PIGMENT WAS

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.193 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE

01:25:29.524 --> 01:25:33.395 region:rollup2
PURPOSE OF LEAD BASED PAINT ON

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:34.896 region:rollup2
HOMES. SO WE HAVE A HUGE CONCERN

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:36.231 region:rollup2
THAT SOMEBODY CAN BE HELD LIABLE

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:38.033 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS THEORY OF LIABILITY

01:25:36.231 --> 01:25:39.768 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEY NEVER PRODUCE

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:40.869 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT THAT IS AT ISSUE

01:25:39.768 --> 01:25:42.037 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS TO EXPOSURE TO

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:43.705 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND THE HEALTH HAZARDS

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:45.107 region:rollup2
IT'S CREATED. THERE AND AGAIN

01:25:43.705 --> 01:25:46.208 region:rollup2
GOING BACK TO THE LITIGATION FOR

01:25:45.107 --> 01:25:47.275 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT CASE WAS

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:48.343 region:rollup2
LITIGATED COMPANIES WERE

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.378 region:rollup2
DISMISSED

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:50.812 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:52.714 region:rollup2
AGAIN THEY NEVER DISTRIBUTED

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:54.049 region:rollup2
PROMOTED OR MARKETED LED PIGMENT

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:55.584 region:rollup2
FOR PURPOSES OF LEAD PAINT A

01:25:54.049 --> 01:25:56.752 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND SO THE

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:58.120 region:rollup2
COURT DISMISSED THEM. BOTH

01:25:56.752 --> 01:25:58.720 region:rollup2
COMPANIES UNDER THE THEORY OF

01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.654 region:rollup2
LIABILITY WOULD NOW BE BROUGHT

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.323 region:rollup2
BACK IN.

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:03.225 region:rollup2
ONCE THE PLAINTIFF ESTABLISHES

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:04.726 region:rollup2
THAT BURDEN OF PROOF WHICH WE%

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:06.328 region:rollup2
SEE AS AS SOMEWHAT LIMITED.

01:26:04.726 --> 01:26:07.729 region:rollup2
THE BURDEN IS NOW ON THE

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:08.363 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT TO PROVE A NEGATIVE.

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.231 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY DID

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:11.366 region:rollup2
IT

01:26:09.231 --> 01:26:13.502 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE MANUFACTURER PROMOTE.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.636 region:rollup2
LED PIGMENTS AND DURING THE

01:26:13.502 --> 01:26:16.371 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OR THE

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.872 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA NEITHER ONE OF

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.540 region:rollup2
THOSE RACES OF WHICH ARE

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:19.908 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.043 region:rollup2
PROVING A NEGATIVE IS ABOUT

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:22.878 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING I WOULD SAY IF NOT

01:26:21.043 --> 01:26:24.446 region:rollup2
IMPOSSIBLE I WILL UTILIZE ONE OF

01:26:22.878 --> 01:26:25.347 region:rollup2
THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE

01:26:24.446 --> 01:26:26.415 region:rollup2
COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THIS WHO

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:28.450 region:rollup2
HAVE SAID. WE.

01:26:26.415 --> 01:26:29.685 region:rollup2
A COMPANY THAT I WILL SAY IT

01:26:28.450 --> 01:26:31.186 region:rollup2
WAS NOT AYE INVOLVED IN THE

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:32.788 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING LITIGATION BUT AS

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:34.222 region:rollup2
SAID WE OFTEN A KEEP RECORDS OF

01:26:32.788 --> 01:26:35.457 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE DO DO WE DON'T

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.892 region:rollup2
KEEP RECORDS OF THINGS THAT WE

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:38.827 region:rollup2
DON'T DO AND SO PROVING A

01:26:36.892 --> 01:26:39.895 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE.

01:26:38.827 --> 01:26:41.897 region:rollup2
BUT LET'S GO EVEN BUT BEYOND

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:43.365 region:rollup2
THAT. UNDER THIS BILL AGAIN GET

01:26:41.897 --> 01:26:44.933 region:rollup2
LET'S TALK ABOUT A COMPANY THAT

01:26:43.365 --> 01:26:46.234 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED LED PIGMENT IN

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:47.436 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:48.470 region:rollup2
CERAMICS

01:26:47.436 --> 01:26:49.704 region:rollup2
SO THAT SATISFIED THEIR BURDEN

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:51.206 region:rollup2
OF PROOF AND THEN IT GOES ON TO

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:52.140 region:rollup2
THEIR AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. THEY

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.575 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SHOW

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.077 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY BUT THEY DIDN'T

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:56.978 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTE OR MARKET LED PIGMENT

01:26:55.077 --> 01:26:58.346 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA. AND A CERTAIN

01:26:56.978 --> 01:26:59.681 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA DURING THE

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:00.916 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TIME PERIOD EVEN THOUGH

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:02.117 region:rollup2
THEY COULD SHOW IT WAS NEVER

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:04.152 region:rollup2
UTILIZED FOR THAT THE PACE IT

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:05.620 region:rollup2
WOULD STILL BE LIABLE. FOR ALL

01:27:04.152 --> 01:27:06.721 region:rollup2
INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH LEAD

01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:08.390 region:rollup2
PICNIC CALIFORNIA HUNDRED

IN THE RISK BY A BILL THE

01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:12.861 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THIS IS

01:27:11.460 --> 01:27:14.229 region:rollup2
JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY.

AGAIN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:35.917 region:rollup2
CREATING THE PRODUCT LA TIMES LA

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:37.185 region:rollup2

UTILIZED IN THE STATE AND I

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:41.323 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR

THEY NEVER CREATED A PRODUCT SO

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:54.302 region:rollup2
AGAIN OUR CONCERN IS THIS GOES

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:55.604 region:rollup2
WELL BEYOND JUST HOLDING THE

DRUG MANUFACTURERS WHO KNEW THAT

01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:16.051 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT WAS DANGEROUS THEY

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:17.719 region:rollup2
WERE WORN BY THE FDA ABOUT IT

01:29:16.051 --> 01:29:18.520 region:rollup2

CONTRIBUTION THERE. AND I WILL

01:31:38.159 --> 01:31:40.795 region:rollup2
SAY THAT JOINED SEVERAL

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:42.464 region:rollup2

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:44.199 region:rollup2
SINGLE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY

01:31:42.464 --> 01:31:46.601 region:rollup2

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:49.237 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT JOINT

01:31:47.769 --> 01:31:50.505 region:rollup2
AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ALSO

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:51.940 region:rollup2
APPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE

01:31:50.505 --> 01:31:54.442 region:rollup2
DEFENDANT'S UNDER AYE PUB PUBLIC

01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:56.644 region:rollup2
NUISANCE THEORY. AND DEFENDANTS

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:58.213 region:rollup2
WERE UNDER EXISTING CASE LAW

01:31:56.644 --> 01:32:00.048 region:rollup2
DEFENDANTS COULD PRESENT

01:31:58.213 --> 01:32:01.583 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SHARE OF

01:32:00.048 --> 01:32:03.151 region:rollup2
THE LIABILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:04.519 region:rollup2
THE COURT TO APPORTION LIABILITY

01:32:03.151 --> 01:32:06.154 region:rollup2
AMONG THE DEFENDANTS THEY

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:07.956 region:rollup2
PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE THEY CHOSE

01:32:06.154 --> 01:32:09.724 region:rollup2
NOT TO PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE. IN

01:32:07.956 --> 01:32:11.526 region:rollup2
ORDER TO APPORTION THE LIABILITY

01:32:09.724 --> 01:32:14.229 region:rollup2
AMONGST THEMSELVES AND SO THEN

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:15.430 region:rollup2
THEY ENDED UP JOINTLY AND

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:16.631 region:rollup2
SEVERALLY LIABLE.

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:17.399 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS ANYONE IN THE

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.299 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION HAVE ANY.

01:32:17.399 --> 01:32:20.068 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:32:18.299 --> 01:32:21.469 region:rollup2
THE COMMENTS ON HOW THEIR

01:32:20.068 --> 01:32:22.103 region:rollup2
THEORY OF LIABILITY HERE DESERVE

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:23.705 region:rollup2
DIFFERS FROM WE'VE SEEN IN THE

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:24.806 region:rollup2
PAST YEAH I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:25.640 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS THAT I THINK THAT YOU

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.108 region:rollup2
MADE A GOOD POINT WHICH IS

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:29.711 region:rollup2
PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IS WHAT

01:32:27.108 --> 01:32:31.913 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE IS. ONE ARM ADD TO THE

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:33.381 region:rollup2
POINT AT HAND ON WHEN YOU HAVE

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:35.016 region:rollup2
NAMED DEFENDANTS THAT ARE ALL

01:32:33.381 --> 01:32:36.184 region:rollup2
BEING SUED TOGETHER THAT IS AN

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.552 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. THE

01:32:36.184 --> 01:32:38.686 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH JOINED SEVERAL IS

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:40.221 region:rollup2
THERE'S NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS WHO

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:42.357 region:rollup2
ARE NOT AT THE TABLE WHO MAY BE

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:44.526 region:rollup2
BANKRUPT OUT OF BUSINESS OR NOT

01:32:42.357 --> 01:32:46.127 region:rollup2
SUIT OR OR FOUND SAID SAID THAT

01:32:44.526 --> 01:32:46.327 region:rollup2
CONCERN.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:49.030 region:rollup2
JUST.

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:50.365 region:rollup2
JUST. APPORTIONED AMONG THE

01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:52.066 region:rollup2
NAMED DEFENDANTS DOESN'T SOLVE

01:32:50.365 --> 01:32:53.401 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM THE OTHER THING I'D

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:55.070 region:rollup2
SAY TO THE WISCONSIN AND THE

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:58.073 region:rollup2
INCIDENT THAT IS TRUE WHAT WAS

01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:59.774 region:rollup2
SAID. BUT IN FACT THAT THE.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:01.543 region:rollup2
STILL REQUIRES DAMAGES AND A

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:02.944 region:rollup2
BREACH OF DUTY WHICH THESE TWO

01:33:01.543 --> 01:33:05.380 region:rollup2
CASES ELIMINATES WHEN YOU PUT IT

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:07.082 region:rollup2
ALL TOGETHER.

01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:08.416 region:rollup2
IT'S A IT'S A LIABILITY STORE.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.717 region:rollup2
IF I JUST MAY FOLLOW UP ON THAT

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:11.019 region:rollup2
EVEN FURTHER MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:12.153 region:rollup2
WITH REGARDS THE WISCONSIN CASE

01:33:11.019 --> 01:33:13.822 region:rollup2
THAT AFTER THAT CASE COME OUT

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.789 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THE FOLLOWING

01:33:13.822 --> 01:33:16.091 region:rollup2
YEAR PASSED LEGISLATION THAT

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:17.058 region:rollup2
SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO UTILIZE

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.827 region:rollup2
MARKET SHARE LIABILITY OR RISK

01:33:17.058 --> 01:33:19.594 region:rollup2
BY BUILDING A LONGER. AND WITH

01:33:18.827 --> 01:33:21.563 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THAT CASE

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AGAIN IT WAS THE

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:24.666 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS OF THE ACTUAL

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:25.600 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT WERE INVOLVED NOT

01:33:24.666 --> 01:33:26.868 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WHO TOUCHED AN

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.969 region:rollup2
INSTRUMENT COMMERCE NOT ANYBODY

01:33:26.868 --> 01:33:29.804 region:rollup2
WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED

01:33:27.969 --> 01:33:31.139 region:rollup2
WITH THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURES THE

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:31.606 region:rollup2
PROJECT IN SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:33:31.139 --> 01:33:32.474 region:rollup2
BROUGHT UP EARLIER BY

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:34.042 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

01:33:32.474 --> 01:33:36.311 region:rollup2
THE INABILITY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL

01:33:34.042 --> 01:33:37.612 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONE UMPS WOULD

01:33:36.311 --> 01:33:39.347 region:rollup2
WHOSE PRODUCT WAS ACTUALLY IN

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.849 region:rollup2
THE HOME AT THE TIME THEY IT

01:33:39.347 --> 01:33:41.883 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:33:40.849 --> 01:33:43.418 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

01:33:41.883 --> 01:33:44.619 region:rollup2
NOT ANYBODY AGAIN AND THE

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:46.287 region:rollup2
STREAM OF COMMERCE AND SO THIS

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:47.288 region:rollup2
BILL GOES FAR BEYOND THAT I'M

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:49.190 region:rollup2
AND HOLDS ANYBODY WHO'S

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:49.757 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REGARDLESS

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:53.628 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER CAN THEY ACTUALLY

01:33:49.757 --> 01:33:54.162 region:rollup2
MADE THE PRODUCT.

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.164 region:rollup2
IF YOU AND YOUR QUESTIONS

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:58.500 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

01:33:56.164 --> 01:33:59.601 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE STILL LOOKING FOR A

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.870 region:rollup2

PASS A MAKE A MAKE A MOTION AND

01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:04.272 region:rollup2
AND JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS I

01:34:03.071 --> 01:34:06.274 region:rollup2
THINK. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

01:34:04.272 --> 01:34:07.775 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF US ARE GRAPPLING

01:34:06.274 --> 01:34:08.843 region:rollup2
WITH IS HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:34:07.775 --> 01:34:09.944 region:rollup2
QUESTION I ASKED A LITTLE

01:34:08.843 --> 01:34:11.546 region:rollup2
EARLIER WHICH IS.

01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:13.214 region:rollup2
HOW MANY OF US CAN ACTUALLY

01:34:11.546 --> 01:34:14.716 region:rollup2
REMEMBER? WHAT PAINT WAS ON THE

01:34:13.214 --> 01:34:16.217 region:rollup2
WALLS OF OUR HOMES WHEN WE WERE

01:34:14.716 --> 01:34:18.720 region:rollup2
LITTLE KIDS AND IF IT TURNED OUT

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:20.021 region:rollup2
THAT WE? BECAME POISONED

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.822 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LEAD PAINT AND OUR

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:22.757 region:rollup2
BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:25.593 region:rollup2
POISONED AND TENS OF THOUSANDS

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:27.228 region:rollup2
OF CHILDREN. ARE POISONED AND I

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:28.696 region:rollup2
CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER THE PAIN

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:31.332 region:rollup2
TO MY WALLS FROM SHERWIN

01:34:28.696 --> 01:34:33.368 region:rollup2
WILLIAMS. OR CONAGRA OR.

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:34.569 region:rollup2
NATIONAL LEAD INDUSTRIES AND

01:34:33.368 --> 01:34:36.404 region:rollup2
THEY FIGHT THIS FOR EIGHTEEN

01:34:34.569 --> 01:34:37.305 region:rollup2
YEARS AN ACCORD WHOLESOME LIABLE

01:34:36.404 --> 01:34:38.806 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY DECIDE TO GO TO

01:34:37.305 --> 01:34:40.441 region:rollup2
THE BALLOT. AND POTENTIALLY WITH

01:34:38.806 --> 01:34:42.310 region:rollup2
A VOTE IN NOVEMBER THEIR

01:34:40.441 --> 01:34:44.312 region:rollup2
LIABILITY WOULD GO AWAY.

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:45.680 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION TO YOU BECAUSE YOU

01:34:44.312 --> 01:34:49.250 region:rollup2
ARE NOW THE FACE OF THE

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.250 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION HERE IS WHAT ARE WE

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:51.920 region:rollup2
THIS AYE IT'S A IT'S A

01:34:50.151 --> 01:34:54.155 region:rollup2
RHETORICAL QUESTION BECAUSE. I

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.523 region:rollup2
ASSUME. YOU HAVE AN ANSWER THAT

01:34:54.155 --> 01:34:57.559 region:rollup2
SUGGESTS THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:59.294 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS.

01:34:57.559 --> 01:35:00.628 region:rollup2
IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT ANSWER.

01:34:59.294 --> 01:35:01.729 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD PAY IF THEY

01:35:00.628 --> 01:35:03.464 region:rollup2
SHOULD PAY THEIR ONE POINT ONE

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:05.133 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS? THAT'S A

01:35:03.464 --> 01:35:06.968 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THING BUT MY GUESS IS

01:35:05.133 --> 01:35:09.204 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT YOUR PERSPECTIVE. OF

01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:09.804 region:rollup2
BUT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THAT'S

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:12.540 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:13.474 region:rollup2
TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE.

SO YOU HAVE.

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:14.709 region:rollup2
AGAIN I JUST REITERATE WE HAVE

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:15.877 region:rollup2
NO POSITION ON THE BALLOT WE

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:16.778 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SUPPORTED THAT AND WE

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.012 region:rollup2
HAVE NO POSITION ON THE

01:35:16.778 --> 01:35:19.280 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING CASE AND SO AGAIN AT

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.381 region:rollup2
THAT CASE STANDS IN THEIR PAIN

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.349 region:rollup2
THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:23.284 region:rollup2
THE COURT FOUND THAT THEY

01:35:21.349 --> 01:35:24.352 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCT. THAT

01:35:23.284 --> 01:35:25.553 region:rollup2
HARM THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD

01:35:24.352 --> 01:35:27.021 region:rollup2
THAT'S CREEK CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.589 region:rollup2
COURT HAS ALREADY SPOKEN THEY'VE

01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:28.756 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT IMPORTS SYSTEM HAS

01:35:27.589 --> 01:35:30.058 region:rollup2
SAID.

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:31.793 region:rollup2
THEY ARE LIABLE FOR ONE POINT

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:32.961 region:rollup2
ONE BILLION DOLLARS NOW THEY'RE

01:35:31.793 --> 01:35:34.462 region:rollup2
GOING TO THE PUBLIC.

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:35.396 region:rollup2
I'M TRYING TO DECEIVE THE PUBLIC

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:35.897 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING THROUGH

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.999 region:rollup2
DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING BY

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:41.369 region:rollup2
SENDING.

01:35:37.999 --> 01:35:42.003 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS OFFICES HUNDREDS OF

01:35:41.369 --> 01:35:44.539 region:rollup2
EMAILS.

01:35:42.003 --> 01:35:47.041 region:rollup2
AND AND A AND PUSHING FORTH

01:35:44.539 --> 01:35:48.109 region:rollup2
MESSAGES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY.

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:49.844 region:rollup2
PLEASE THE DECEPTIVELY FALSE

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:50.678 region:rollup2
SO I'D

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:51.879 region:rollup2
AYE DON'T IT I'M NOT GOING TO

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.780 region:rollup2
DISPUTE THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:35:51.879 --> 01:35:53.448 region:rollup2
THOSE EMAILS OR ANYTHING THAT'S

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.649 region:rollup2
GOING ON AGAIN WERE NOT INVOLVED

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:56.517 region:rollup2
IN THE CAMPAIGN ON THE

01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:58.253 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE BUT HERE. AGAIN I

01:35:56.517 --> 01:36:00.688 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:02.223 region:rollup2
HOLD ANY COMPANY LIABLE FOR THE

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:03.591 region:rollup2
HARM THAT WAS CREATED BY A

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:05.059 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPANY THAT CREATED

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.527 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCT SO NO LIABILITY

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:07.528 region:rollup2
KNOWN FOR THE COMPANIES THAT HAD

01:36:06.527 --> 01:36:09.163 region:rollup2
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:10.632 region:rollup2
YET NO LIABILITY I DON'T THINK

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:12.066 region:rollup2
THAT THEY. ANYONE WHO'S THAT.

01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:14.135 region:rollup2
MARKETED OR PROMOTED LED PIGMENT

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:15.703 region:rollup2
FOR CERAMICS SHOULD BE WITHHELD

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:16.971 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED PERCENT LIABLE FOR

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:18.206 region:rollup2
LEAD PAINT THAT WAS UTILIZED

01:36:16.971 --> 01:36:19.440 region:rollup2
INSIDE A HOME AN EXPOSE CHILDREN

01:36:18.206 --> 01:36:20.675 region:rollup2
TO LEAD POISON I DON'T THINK

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.543 region:rollup2
THAT'S A FAIR DUE PROCESS

01:36:20.675 --> 01:36:23.778 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS. IF YOU HAD NOTHING TO

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:24.946 region:rollup2
DO WITH THE PRODUCT THAT YOU

01:36:23.778 --> 01:36:25.913 region:rollup2
SHOULD SOMEHOW NOW BE HUNDRED

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:27.115 region:rollup2
PERCENT ON THE HOOK THAT'S OUR

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:28.483 region:rollup2
CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE WE

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:29.250 region:rollup2
COULD PROBABLY HAVE A LONG

01:36:28.483 --> 01:36:30.852 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:33.254 region:rollup2
BUT LISTEN AT THE END OF THE

01:36:30.852 --> 01:36:34.422 region:rollup2
DAY THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES ARE

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:35.690 region:rollup2
THE NEW TOBACCO COMPANIES OF TWO

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:37.425 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN.

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.893 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WORDS AFTER MANY MANY

01:36:37.425 --> 01:36:40.695 region:rollup2
DECADES OF DECEIVING THE PUBLIC

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:42.096 region:rollup2
KNOWING.

01:36:40.695 --> 01:36:42.864 region:rollup2
AND INTENTIONALLY DECEIVING THE

01:36:42.096 --> 01:36:44.232 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THEIR

01:36:42.864 --> 01:36:45.833 region:rollup2
PRODUCTS.

01:36:44.232 --> 01:36:46.668 region:rollup2
THERE NOW TRY TO ESCAPE

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:47.302 region:rollup2
LIABILITY THROUGH WHATEVER WAY

01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:48.903 region:rollup2
THEY CAN.

01:36:47.302 --> 01:36:50.138 region:rollup2
THEY TRY TO DO TO THE COURT

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:51.272 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THE COURT SYSTEM FOUND

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:52.874 region:rollup2
THEM LIABLE NOW THEY'RE TRYING

01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:55.276 region:rollup2
TO GO TO THE BALLOT. WHAT WE'RE

01:36:52.874 --> 01:36:57.412 region:rollup2
SIMPLY SAYING IS ARE WE NEED TO

01:36:55.276 --> 01:37:00.315 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IS GOING

01:36:57.412 --> 01:37:01.616 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:37:00.315 --> 01:37:03.051 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING POISONED?

01:37:01.616 --> 01:37:03.818 region:rollup2
BY LEAD AND I HAVEN'T HEARD

01:37:03.051 --> 01:37:05.520 region:rollup2
ANYTHING.

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:06.854 region:rollup2
TO SUGGEST FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:08.856 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO DO

01:37:06.854 --> 01:37:09.924 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.892 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVE

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:11.959 region:rollup2
THAT DISCUSSION TO TRY AND

01:37:10.892 --> 01:37:13.394 region:rollup2
RESOLVE THE ISSUE.

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:14.696 region:rollup2
BUT I WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:16.130 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WITH

01:37:14.696 --> 01:37:17.031 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO ALL COMPANIES IN THE

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:17.999 region:rollup2
STREAM ACCREDITS MBA AND WAITING

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.1000 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR THE RIGHT APPROACH

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:21.269 region:rollup2
BUT WE BEAT SUPPORTIVE.

01:37:18.1000 --> 01:37:22.837 region:rollup2
AT TRYING TO LOOK AT A.

01:37:21.269 --> 01:37:24.505 region:rollup2
HOLISTIC.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:26.674 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHERE'S LEAD COMING

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:28.209 region:rollup2
FROM POWER KIDS GETTING EXPOSED

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.977 region:rollup2
WHO CAUSED THE DAMAGE HOW MUCH

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:31.279 region:rollup2
OF IT IS NATURAL WHAT WE DO IS A

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:33.448 region:rollup2
STATE. WHERE DOES THE FUNDING

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:35.983 region:rollup2
COME FROM ALL OF THOSE ARE GOOD

01:37:33.448 --> 01:37:36.617 region:rollup2
DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE THAT WOULD

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:36.818 region:rollup2
BE ONE TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:38.286 region:rollup2
WITH?

01:37:36.818 --> 01:37:38.886 region:rollup2
CREATING LITIGATION AND WE DON'T

01:37:38.286 --> 01:37:40.321 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THAT

01:37:38.886 --> 01:37:41.422 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:37:40.321 --> 01:37:43.157 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:45.793 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS AT

01:37:43.157 --> 01:37:48.096 region:rollup2
THIS TIME AGAIN COMPANIES WHO

01:37:45.793 --> 01:37:49.697 region:rollup2
MARKETED AT FALSELY ADVERTISE TO

01:37:48.096 --> 01:37:51.165 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS. WHO HAD INTERNAL

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:52.200 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS SAYING THEY KNEW THAT

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:54.535 region:rollup2
THIS WAS GOING TO?

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:56.170 region:rollup2
THIS WAS GOING TO IMPACT QUOTE

01:37:54.535 --> 01:37:58.139 region:rollup2
NEGRO AND PER WRITTEN FAMILIES.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:00.541 region:rollup2
THE IMPACTS THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:01.743 region:rollup2
AROUND THE STATE ARE AND NOW

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:03.411 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTERS.

01:38:01.743 --> 01:38:04.445 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT SOMEHOW HOMEOWNERS

01:38:03.411 --> 01:38:04.946 region:rollup2
OR LIABILITY FOR FOR WHAT'S

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:07.648 region:rollup2
HAPPENING.

01:38:04.946 --> 01:38:08.916 region:rollup2
.

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:11.219 region:rollup2
WE WE WE DON'T HAVE SOLUTIONS

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:12.920 region:rollup2
AND AND AND LESS YOU CAN TELL US

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:14.088 region:rollup2
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. I

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.089 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED WE NEED DIFFERENT

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:18.192 region:rollup2
WAYS TO GO OUT THE SO WITH THAT

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:19.560 region:rollup2
I AM OF THIS BILL.

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.094 region:rollup2
THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AND

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:23.264 region:rollup2

I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK

01:38:27.969 --> 01:38:32.240 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT I MAY. ALTHOUGH

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:34.208 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE SHELL DOES SAY THAT

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.743 region:rollup2
THE INJURED PARTY MAY ESTABLISH

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:37.812 region:rollup2
A PRIMA FACIE CASE THAT A

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:39.013 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PARTY. OUGHT IS THE

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:40.248 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF THE INJURY OF THE

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:42.150 region:rollup2
INJURED PARTY PROVES BY

01:38:40.248 --> 01:38:44.919 region:rollup2
PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE.

01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:46.788 region:rollup2
THAT A PARTY PRODUCE SOLD

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:47.722 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED.

01:38:46.788 --> 01:38:49.524 region:rollup2
THE TYPE OF LEAD PAINT ON

01:38:47.722 --> 01:38:50.591 region:rollup2
PIGMENT THAT CAUSED INJURY MY

01:38:49.524 --> 01:38:52.126 region:rollup2
QUESTION DEALS WITH THE WORD

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:53.861 region:rollup2
PROMOTED.

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:55.430 region:rollup2

TIMES BE A HELD LIABLE. ARE IT

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.476 region:rollup2
IN THIS A SCHEME OF THINGS.

01:39:07.008 --> 01:39:09.777 region:rollup2
AND IF IF IT'S SO YOU KNOW HOW

01:39:08.476 --> 01:39:10.778 region:rollup2

COVER?

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:17.251 region:rollup2
SO I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT

01:39:15.383 --> 01:39:18.986 region:rollup2
AND THE LA TIMES THE OAKLAND

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:21.088 region:rollup2
SHOULD. OTHER PUBLICATIONS THAT

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:23.090 region:rollup2
RAN ADS FOR LEAD BASED PAINTS

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:24.358 region:rollup2
THAT IS SIMPLY ALL THAT THEY DID

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:26.093 region:rollup2
IT THEY DID NOT AFFIRMATIVELY

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:27.562 region:rollup2
PROMOTE LEAD PAINT FOR USE IN

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:29.230 region:rollup2
HOMES IN THE WAY THAT THE.

01:39:27.562 --> 01:39:30.731 region:rollup2
DEFENDANTS IN OUR LAWSUIT DID

01:39:29.230 --> 01:39:32.200 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE WAY THAT THE REST

01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:33.701 region:rollup2
OF THE LEAD INDUSTRY DEAD AND

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.002 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WERE AS WELL AS LONG AS

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:36.571 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INDICIA

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:37.738 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE

01:39:36.571 --> 01:39:39.574 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT IS VERTICALLY

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:41.576 region:rollup2
VERTICALLY. IN INTEGRATED

01:39:39.574 --> 01:39:43.744 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES WHERE COMPANIES LIKE

01:39:41.576 --> 01:39:46.147 region:rollup2
SHERWIN WILLIAMS AND THEY WENT

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:47.582 region:rollup2
FROM MINE TO STORE SO THEY WHERE

01:39:46.147 --> 01:39:49.383 region:rollup2
THE PRODUCERS THEY WORD THE

01:39:47.582 --> 01:39:50.852 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTORS THEY WHERE THE

01:39:49.383 --> 01:39:52.386 region:rollup2
PROMOTERS THEY WERE THE SELLERS.

01:39:50.852 --> 01:39:54.088 region:rollup2
THEY ON THE MINDS THE SMELTERS

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:55.289 region:rollup2
THE REFINERIES THE RETAIL STORES

01:39:54.088 --> 01:39:57.625 region:rollup2
ETCETERA THEY HANDLED EVERY

01:39:55.289 --> 01:39:58.993 region:rollup2
ASPECT FROM PRODUCTION SET SAIL.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:40:00.494 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:01.796 region:rollup2
PROMOTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:02.997 region:rollup2
THOSE TYPES OF PROMOTIONAL

01:40:01.796 --> 01:40:04.565 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES WHERE THEY

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:06.434 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVELY PUT OUT THEY

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:08.169 region:rollup2
CREATED THE ADS THEY DISSEMINATE

01:40:06.434 --> 01:40:10.004 region:rollup2
THE ADS THEY PRODUCED HANDBOOKS

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:11.873 region:rollup2
AND JINGLES. THAT TOLD THAT

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:13.441 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS TO USE OUR PRODUCT IN

01:40:11.873 --> 01:40:15.676 region:rollup2
YOUR HOMES WE'RE NOT TALKING

01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:18.579 region:rollup2
ABOUT NEWSPAPERS THAT SIMPLY

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:19.113 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED THE ADS THAT WERE

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.314 region:rollup2
CREATED.

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:23.050 region:rollup2
IF EVERY NEWSPAPER BECAME

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:24.519 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WRONGDOING

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:25.820 region:rollup2
THAT WAS PERPETRATED BY THE

01:40:24.519 --> 01:40:27.255 region:rollup2
PUBLISHING OF ADS IN THEIR

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:29.023 region:rollup2
PAPERS THEY WOULD LONG BE OUT OF

01:40:27.255 --> 01:40:30.424 region:rollup2
BUSINESS. AND I DON'T THINK

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:31.559 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE FIRST

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.827 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT WORKS I DON'T THINK

01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:34.328 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW COURTS WOULD

01:40:32.827 --> 01:40:34.829 region:rollup2
INTERPRET THIS STATUTE IF

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:38.699 region:rollup2
ADOPTED. IT THIS BILL IF

01:40:34.829 --> 01:40:40.701 region:rollup2
ADOPTED.

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:41.535 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALL SUCH A.

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:42.670 region:rollup2
I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.504 region:rollup2
PROMOTED PASSED.

01:40:42.670 --> 01:40:45.573 region:rollup2
OUR LANGUAGE

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:47.008 region:rollup2
SO.

01:40:45.573 --> 01:40:48.009 region:rollup2
IN YOUR DEFENSE OF OF MR CAO

01:40:47.008 --> 01:40:50.177 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:40:48.009 --> 01:40:51.612 region:rollup2
YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPANY

01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:53.714 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE LIABLE

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:55.616 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE OTHER VERBS WE USED IN

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:56.984 region:rollup2
THE US OUT ALSO PROMOTED AND

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:58.686 region:rollup2
THEN YOU WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT

01:40:56.984 --> 01:41:00.121 region:rollup2
JINGLES AND I'M THINKING PR

01:40:58.686 --> 01:41:02.423 region:rollup2
AGENCIES AND. AND.

01:41:00.121 --> 01:41:04.292 region:rollup2
GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT MAYBE HAD

01:41:02.423 --> 01:41:05.192 region:rollup2
ZERO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ON THE

01:41:04.292 --> 01:41:06.928 region:rollup2
DANGERS OF LEAD PAINT.

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:09.096 region:rollup2
WHO?

01:41:06.928 --> 01:41:11.666 region:rollup2
WHY IS THAT WERE NECESSARY WHO

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:13.801 region:rollup2
ARE YOU? CAPTURING THAT WOULDN'T

01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:15.570 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE BE CAPTURED ON AND WHY

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:17.171 region:rollup2
DO WE NEED THE WORD PROMOTED.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:18.372 region:rollup2
YET SO I LOOK AT IT I WILL GIVE

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.941 region:rollup2
YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:21.208 region:rollup2
ON THE LAWSUIT THAT WE FILED

01:41:19.941 --> 01:41:23.377 region:rollup2
WITHIN NINE OTHER CITIES AND

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:25.046 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN THIS CASE. M. ARE AT

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:26.948 region:rollup2
HIGHER. PUBLIC NUISANCE BECAUSE

01:41:25.046 --> 01:41:29.383 region:rollup2
OF ACTION WAS PREDICATED UPON

01:41:26.948 --> 01:41:31.118 region:rollup2
PROMOTION SO THAT DEFENDANTS IN

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:32.486 region:rollup2
OUR CASE WERE FOUND LIABLE FOR

01:41:31.118 --> 01:41:33.020 region:rollup2
CREATING A PUBLIC NUISANCE IN

01:41:32.486 --> 01:41:34.889 region:rollup2
OUR TEN JURISDICTIONS. FOR

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:36.824 region:rollup2
THEIR.

01:41:34.889 --> 01:41:37.925 region:rollup2
NOT JUST PROMOTE AT PRODUCTION

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:39.493 region:rollup2
OF LEAD PAINT NOT JUST FOR

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.295 region:rollup2
PUTTING UP DANGEROUS PRODUCT

01:41:39.493 --> 01:41:42.530 region:rollup2
INTO THE STREAM OF COMMERCE NOT

01:41:41.295 --> 01:41:43.698 region:rollup2
JUST FOR SELLING A DANGEROUS

01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:46.067 region:rollup2
PRODUCT BUT FOR THEIR

01:41:43.698 --> 01:41:47.601 region:rollup2
AFFIRMATIVE PROMOTION. OF OF

01:41:46.067 --> 01:41:49.170 region:rollup2
LEAD PAINT WHILE KNOWING ABOUT

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:50.271 region:rollup2
HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS WHILE

01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:51.806 region:rollup2
KNOWING THAT IT WAS GOING TO

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:53.541 region:rollup2
CREATE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

01:41:51.806 --> 01:41:55.643 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND SO

01:41:53.541 --> 01:41:57.678 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT AFFIRMATIVE

01:41:55.643 --> 01:41:59.280 region:rollup2
PROMOTION THAT WAS FAR MORE

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:00.014 region:rollup2
EGREGIOUS THAN PUTTING A

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.449 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO THE

01:42:00.014 --> 01:42:02.817 region:rollup2
STREAM OF COMMERCE THAT'S WHAT

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:04.485 region:rollup2
THEY WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

01:42:02.817 --> 01:42:06.620 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT. EXISTING PUBLIC

01:42:04.485 --> 01:42:08.923 region:rollup2
NUISANCE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:10.057 region:rollup2
LIABILITY FOR SO SO MAYBE THE

01:42:08.923 --> 01:42:13.260 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE

01:42:10.057 --> 01:42:14.428 region:rollup2
SHOULD INCLUDE AND PROMOTED

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:17.331 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN OR PROMOTED.

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:19.867 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY ALTHOUGH

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:21.168 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:23.037 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO PROMOTED. LEAD

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:25.673 region:rollup2
PAINT.

01:42:23.037 --> 01:42:26.841 region:rollup2
THAT YOU NEED THE STAND ALONE

01:42:25.673 --> 01:42:28.409 region:rollup2
TERM PROMOTED WITHOUT TYING IT

01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:29.310 region:rollup2
TO KNOWLEDGE

01:42:28.409 --> 01:42:30.711 region:rollup2
SOME SORT CONSTRUCTING KNOWLEDGE

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:32.980 region:rollup2
OF OF.

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:35.850 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTING THAT

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:37.318 region:rollup2
REQUIRES US TO KEEP AYE I'M.

01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:38.285 region:rollup2
YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT MAKING ME MORE

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:39.920 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE YOU'RE MAKING ME

01:42:38.285 --> 01:42:41.222 region:rollup2
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I AM.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.623 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR AT WHO YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:43.791 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET OUT AND IT SEEMS

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:45.760 region:rollup2
THAT THERE COULD BE.

01:42:43.791 --> 01:42:47.194 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO MAY BE OUR SHOULD NOT

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:48.596 region:rollup2
BE HELD LIABLE YEAH AND ONE WAY

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:50.464 region:rollup2
THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE

01:42:48.596 --> 01:42:52.233 region:rollup2
THIS IS BY SAYING. THAT IT'S THE

01:42:50.464 --> 01:42:54.001 region:rollup2
PROMOTERS WHO HAD KNOWLEDGE OF

01:42:52.233 --> 01:42:55.503 region:rollup2
THE HARMS THAT THAT WE'RE GOING

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:56.504 region:rollup2
TO BEAT THAT WOULD RESULT FROM

01:42:55.503 --> 01:42:58.139 region:rollup2
THE LEAD PAINT THAT THEY ARE

01:42:56.504 --> 01:42:59.373 region:rollup2
PROMOTING. THANK YOU AND I'M TO

01:42:58.139 --> 01:43:01.042 region:rollup2
THE AUTHOR I I ASSUME WE'LL

01:42:59.373 --> 01:43:02.977 region:rollup2
WE'LL SEE SOME OF THESE CHANGES

01:43:01.042 --> 01:43:04.445 region:rollup2
IF THE* OUT TODAY. YEAH GOOD

01:43:02.977 --> 01:43:05.946 region:rollup2
POINT SET SUCH WHAT I'M A

01:43:04.445 --> 01:43:07.415 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO OPPOSITIONS POINTS

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:08.115 region:rollup2
CONCERNS FROM THAT ARE MY

01:43:07.415 --> 01:43:09.950 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AND.

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:12.386 region:rollup2
I'M TAKING CAREFUL NOTES HERE

01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:16.590 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME WASTE IMPROVE THE

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:17.191 region:rollup2
BILL STRENGTHENED TECHNIQUE.

01:43:16.590 --> 01:43:17.992 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN A SECOND WE DO

01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:20.227 region:rollup2
HAVE EMOTIONS.

01:43:17.992 --> 01:43:22.830 region:rollup2
THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

01:43:20.227 --> 01:43:24.598 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:26.167 region:rollup2
SO.

01:43:24.598 --> 01:43:28.002 region:rollup2
MISTRESS IN THIS REMINDS ME SO

01:43:26.167 --> 01:43:28.936 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE ASBESTOS CASES WE

01:43:28.002 --> 01:43:30.371 region:rollup2
HAD SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:32.006 region:rollup2
INJURED IN TRYING TO FIND THE

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:34.241 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURERS. TRYING TO FIND

01:43:32.006 --> 01:43:36.410 region:rollup2
THOSE UNTIL FINALLY THAT THE

01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:36.911 region:rollup2
ISSUE WAS RESOLVED I THINK WE

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:37.978 region:rollup2
ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT

01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:39.280 region:rollup2
DIRECTION.

01:43:37.978 --> 01:43:41.782 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT THE CHILDREN ARE

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.184 region:rollup2
SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM.

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:43.818 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE

01:43:43.184 --> 01:43:46.187 region:rollup2
FOR THESE CHILDREN THEY'VE BEEN

01:43:43.818 --> 01:43:48.189 region:rollup2
EXPOSED AND THEY WILL SUFFER THE

01:43:46.187 --> 01:43:50.524 region:rollup2
REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF

01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:51.992 region:rollup2
THIS EXPOSURE. AND TO MAKE IT

01:43:50.524 --> 01:43:53.427 region:rollup2
EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS IS THE FACT

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:55.062 region:rollup2
THAT THE LEAD OR THE PINK

01:43:53.427 --> 01:43:56.464 region:rollup2
COMPANIES KNEW WHAT THEY WERE

01:43:55.062 --> 01:43:58.466 region:rollup2
DOING.

01:43:56.464 --> 01:44:00.434 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY AFTER THE EIGHTEEN

01:43:58.466 --> 01:44:02.269 region:rollup2
YEARS FINALLY THEY ARE FOUND.

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:04.305 region:rollup2
A LIABLE THEY'RE TOLD TO PUT THE

01:44:02.269 --> 01:44:07.074 region:rollup2
ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS UP

01:44:04.305 --> 01:44:07.608 region:rollup2
AS A FUND BECAUSE OF THISIS.

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:07.875 region:rollup2
THE DAMAGE THEY'VE ALREADY

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.910 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:12.113 region:rollup2
THERE WERE SOME.

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:13.914 region:rollup2
STUDIES THAT WERE SHARED WITH US

01:44:12.113 --> 01:44:15.616 region:rollup2
ALSO. IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE

01:44:13.914 --> 01:44:17.384 region:rollup2
COST OF ABATEMENT VERSUS THE

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:22.089 region:rollup2
COST OF HAVING TO KNOW CARE FOR

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:23.958 region:rollup2

A LANDLORD CAN STILL MOVE IT

02:07:38.985 --> 02:07:42.622 region:rollup2
TURNED OUT TO DO THE REHAB AS WE

COURT SAYS.

02:09:29.762 --> 02:09:32.898 region:rollup2
THERE ARE FOUR LATE PAYS WHICH

ARE TOLERABLE GIVE THE TENANT

02:09:32.898 --> 02:09:35.434 region:rollup2
MORE TIME.

02:09:34.567 --> 02:09:37.270 region:rollup2
SECOND THERE ARE SAID THERE WERE

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:38.838 region:rollup2
TWO POINTS.

02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:40.539 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN A

02:09:38.838 --> 02:09:42.541 region:rollup2
LAMB OR CHOOSES TO TERMINATE THE

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:44.877 region:rollup2
TENANCY IT'S THE MOST

02:09:42.541 --> 02:09:47.747 region:rollup2
EXPEDITIOUS Y.. AND THEY DON'T

HAS BEEN. ALLEGED.

02:09:50.416 --> 02:09:54.153 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY YOU TERMINATE THE

02:09:51.784 --> 02:09:55.788 region:rollup2
TENANCY THAT THE TENET IS

02:09:54.153 --> 02:09:57.757 region:rollup2

AND THE OTHER TENANTS THE GOOD

02:09:59.492 --> 02:10:03.396 region:rollup2
TENANTS ARE COMPLAINING.

02:10:01.427 --> 02:10:04.897 region:rollup2
THOSE GOOD TENANTS DO NOT WANT

02:10:03.396 --> 02:10:07.333 region:rollup2
TO ACT AS A WITNESS THEY WILL

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:09.435 region:rollup2
NOT TAKE OFF FROM WORK. THEY

02:10:07.333 --> 02:10:11.070 region:rollup2
WILL NOT GO TO COURT THEY WILL

02:10:09.435 --> 02:10:13.072 region:rollup2
THEY WILL CHOOSE OTHER

02:10:11.070 --> 02:10:14.640 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE PATHS.

02:10:13.072 --> 02:10:16.442 region:rollup2
THEY'LL LEAVE AND VACATE.

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:17.810 region:rollup2

TENET THERE IN RESIDENTS

02:10:20.346 --> 02:10:23.149 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION BEFORE THE

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.750 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE IS WHO ARE WE TRYING

02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:26.352 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT LAMBERTS DON'T DO

02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:28.087 region:rollup2
THIS MALICIOUSLY.

02:10:26.352 --> 02:10:30.222 region:rollup2
THIS CARLTON POINTED OUT THERE A

02:10:28.087 --> 02:10:32.391 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OTHER LAWS ARE ANTI

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:33.959 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION LAWS WHICH WE

02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:36.128 region:rollup2

SO WE ARE NOT IN A A MYSTERY OR

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:47.606 region:rollup2
A BLACK HOLE IF YOU WILL.

02:10:45.438 --> 02:10:49.642 region:rollup2

AND OTHER REASONS.

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:56.148 region:rollup2
PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE

WELL REMAINS IN PLACE THEY

02:13:47.019 --> 02:13:49.121 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL ORDINANCES

02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:49.989 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOUNDS DAYS ACTUALLY

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:53.192 region:rollup2
LIST TWELVE SPECIFIC.

02:13:49.989 --> 02:13:56.161 region:rollup2

HAVE YOU.

02:14:04.303 --> 02:14:08.173 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID I DO LIKE THE

02:14:06.739 --> 02:14:10.976 region:rollup2
FACT THAT IT THAT THE BILL DOES

02:14:08.173 --> 02:14:11.410 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:14:10.976 --> 02:14:11.744 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THAT STEP.

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:12.945 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT.

02:14:11.744 --> 02:14:14.480 region:rollup2
.

02:14:12.945 --> 02:14:15.681 region:rollup2

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:16.782 region:rollup2
DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO DO THAT.

02:14:15.681 --> 02:14:18.150 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO BE A GOOD THING I

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:20.052 region:rollup2
THINK IT WAS IT WAS AN EASY

02:14:18.150 --> 02:14:21.220 region:rollup2
PROCESS PUBLICITY GO THROUGH

02:14:20.052 --> 02:14:23.455 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE OTHER A LOT OF

02:14:21.220 --> 02:14:25.124 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IN DIFFICULT HEARINGS BUT

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:26.458 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S THE ROLE OF OF. A

02:14:25.124 --> 02:14:28.360 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GO TO THAT

02:14:26.458 --> 02:14:30.362 region:rollup2
PROSTITUTE BUT IT'S BEST FOR

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:33.165 region:rollup2
THEM. AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:35.200 region:rollup2
THE THE. THE ANY DEGREE OF.

02:14:33.165 --> 02:14:35.901 region:rollup2
CONCERN A CRITICISM THAT THIS

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:37.236 region:rollup2
IS TOO BROAD BECAUSE NOT A

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:38.637 region:rollup2
SPECIFICITY WELL LOCAL

02:14:37.236 --> 02:14:40.706 region:rollup2
ORDINANCES CAN ADD THAT

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:42.741 region:rollup2
SPECIFICITY SPECIFICITY AS IT

02:14:40.706 --> 02:14:43.842 region:rollup2
SUITS THEIR JURISDICTION AND

02:14:42.741 --> 02:14:45.978 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT SAN JOSE DID AND AND

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:47.079 region:rollup2
SO GIVEN THE FACT. THAT THIS

02:14:45.978 --> 02:14:47.980 region:rollup2
BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THE WORK

02:14:47.079 --> 02:14:49.815 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DONE.

02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:50.449 region:rollup2
A BY THEJURISDICTION I

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:51.350 region:rollup2
REPRESENT.

02:14:50.449 --> 02:14:52.985 region:rollup2
I'M CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE

02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:54.753 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING IT AND HOPE THAT

02:14:52.985 --> 02:14:56.555 region:rollup2
OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TAKE

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:58.390 region:rollup2
THE ACTIONS THAT. THE DIFFICULT

02:14:56.555 --> 02:14:59.692 region:rollup2
ACTIONS THAT SOUNDS A DID TO

02:14:58.390 --> 02:15:01.460 region:rollup2
COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND

02:14:59.692 --> 02:15:04.563 region:rollup2

02:24:14.746 --> 02:24:18.116 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THE GRAMM LEACH

02:24:15.714 --> 02:24:19.117 region:rollup2
BLILEY ACT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO

ENSURE THE SECURITY AND

CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:25.657 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:28.059 region:rollup2
THE GOP ACT THAT TO SEE ISSUES

02:24:25.657 --> 02:24:29.394 region:rollup2
SAFEGUARD RULES WHICH REQUIRES

INFORMATION SECURE.

02:24:34.766 --> 02:24:36.902 region:rollup2
THE CREDIT REPORTING INDUSTRY

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:38.870 region:rollup2
ALSO FOLLOWS GOOD BUSINESS

02:24:36.902 --> 02:24:39.771 region:rollup2
PRACTICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:40.972 region:rollup2
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS

02:24:39.771 --> 02:24:43.308 region:rollup2
AND TECHNOLOGY AMONG OTHER

02:24:40.972 --> 02:24:45.143 region:rollup2
NATIONAL STANDARDS.

02:24:43.308 --> 02:24:46.444 region:rollup2
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND

02:24:45.143 --> 02:24:47.979 region:rollup2
AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY

02:24:46.444 --> 02:24:49.981 region:rollup2
ALL THE CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS IS

02:24:47.979 --> 02:24:50.949 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THESE PRACTICES

02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:52.684 region:rollup2
AND ASSIST IN PREVENTING

02:24:50.949 --> 02:24:54.319 region:rollup2
PREACHES. RATHER THAN EXPOSING

02:24:52.684 --> 02:24:56.888 region:rollup2
OUR SYSTEM TO OTHER POTENTIAL

02:24:54.319 --> 02:24:57.956 region:rollup2
SECURITY VULNERABILITIES.

02:24:56.888 --> 02:24:58.657 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:24:57.956 --> 02:25:00.725 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING SECURITY

02:24:58.657 --> 02:25:02.294 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITIES IN THE SYSTEM.

02:25:00.725 --> 02:25:03.662 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT

02:25:02.294 --> 02:25:05.430 region:rollup2
EACH OF THE VULNERABILITIES HAVE

02:25:03.662 --> 02:25:06.598 region:rollup2
TO BE ASSESSED TO RISK AS WELL.

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:07.899 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE THAT SOME WOMEN'S

02:25:06.598 --> 02:25:11.236 region:rollup2
WILLINGNESS TO FURTHER DISCUSS

02:25:07.899 --> 02:25:12.704 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZING OUR SECURITY RISK.

02:25:11.236 --> 02:25:14.506 region:rollup2
WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH OTHER

02:25:12.704 --> 02:25:16.608 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL.

02:25:14.506 --> 02:25:18.376 region:rollup2
THE CIVIC WAY THE BILL REQUIRES

02:25:16.608 --> 02:25:19.978 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHALL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT

02:25:18.376 --> 02:25:21.346 region:rollup2
A SOFTWARE UPDATES OR PATCH

02:25:19.978 --> 02:25:23.381 region:rollup2
WITHIN THREE DAYS.

02:25:21.346 --> 02:25:24.416 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE.

02:25:23.381 --> 02:25:25.850 region:rollup2
THE WORD EMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO BE

02:25:24.416 --> 02:25:28.353 region:rollup2
FURTHER TO.

02:25:25.850 --> 02:25:30.555 region:rollup2
A FINE THE MEAN ASSETS A TO IT

02:25:28.353 --> 02:25:32.157 region:rollup2
ASSESS PLAN AND TEST

02:25:30.555 --> 02:25:33.658 region:rollup2
AS THAT IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES

02:25:32.157 --> 02:25:35.927 region:rollup2
PLACE BEFORE PATCH CAN BEGIN TO

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:37.295 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:25:35.927 --> 02:25:38.496 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE

02:25:37.295 --> 02:25:39.931 region:rollup2
COULD BE GOT COMPLICATIONS

02:25:38.496 --> 02:25:42.300 region:rollup2
MANDATING A TIME FRAME THE

02:25:39.931 --> 02:25:44.169 region:rollup2
THIRTY DAYS WITHOUT FLEXIBILITY.

02:25:42.300 --> 02:25:46.004 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF WE FIND OUT

02:25:44.169 --> 02:25:47.839 region:rollup2
THAT A PACK OR SECURITY UPDATE

02:25:46.004 --> 02:25:49.341 region:rollup2
HAD THE BILL THE PROBLEM NAY NEW

02:25:47.839 --> 02:25:51.676 region:rollup2
PATCH OR UPDATE IS NOT READY AT

02:25:49.341 --> 02:25:53.478 region:rollup2
THAT TIME. I WAS STILL OBLIGATED

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:56.181 region:rollup2
TO AND IT INSTALL THAT PATCH OR

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:57.148 region:rollup2
UPDATE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS.

02:25:56.181 --> 02:25:59.351 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION THERE HAVE BEEN

02:25:57.148 --> 02:26:01.353 region:rollup2
TIMES IN A SOFTWARE UPDATE OUR

02:25:59.351 --> 02:26:03.088 region:rollup2
PATCH IS NOT OF THE APPROPRIATE

02:26:01.353 --> 02:26:05.090 region:rollup2
RECOURSE BUT UNDER THIS BILL IT

02:26:03.088 --> 02:26:06.491 region:rollup2
IS MANDATED.

02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:07.792 region:rollup2
FINALLY WHEN THE MOST TROUBLING

02:26:06.491 --> 02:26:09.094 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IS A

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:10.362 region:rollup2
CIVIL PENALTY OF FIVE HUNDRED

02:26:09.094 --> 02:26:11.663 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR EACH PERSON WHOSE

02:26:10.362 --> 02:26:12.831 region:rollup2
INFORMATION COULD BE POTENTIALLY

02:26:11.663 --> 02:26:14.633 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED WITHOUT SHOWING ANY

02:26:12.831 --> 02:26:16.067 region:rollup2
INJURY.

02:26:14.633 --> 02:26:17.769 region:rollup2
WHAT THE ANALYSIS STATED THAT

02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:19.938 region:rollup2
THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE REASONABLE

02:26:17.769 --> 02:26:21.640 region:rollup2
I WOULD SUGGEST OTHERWISE?

02:26:19.938 --> 02:26:23.541 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT IT WHAT IF WE TAKE

02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.809 region:rollup2
THAT BUT FAX EXAMPLE.

02:26:23.541 --> 02:26:25.410 region:rollup2
AND TAKE TEN PERCENT OF THE

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:26.645 region:rollup2
RECORD RELEASE SAYS CALIFORNIA

02:26:25.410 --> 02:26:27.912 region:rollup2
SHARE.

02:26:26.645 --> 02:26:29.447 region:rollup2
AND ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THOSE

02:26:27.912 --> 02:26:31.349 region:rollup2
PEOPLE FILE TO RECOVER THE FIVE

02:26:29.447 --> 02:26:32.584 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

02:26:31.349 --> 02:26:33.518 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO A COST OF

02:26:32.584 --> 02:26:35.520 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:36.388 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:38.590 region:rollup2
THIS IS OVER A QUARTER OF

02:26:36.388 --> 02:26:39.824 region:rollup2
EQUIFAX'S MARKET CAP.

02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:42.360 region:rollup2
THIS PROVISION HAS THE ABILITY

02:26:39.824 --> 02:26:43.528 region:rollup2
TO BANKRUPT COMPANIES.

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:45.764 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE SAME STANDARD APPLIED

02:26:43.528 --> 02:26:46.331 region:rollup2
TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS UNIVERSITY

02:26:45.764 --> 02:26:47.699 region:rollup2
SYSTEM CITY COUNTIES IN THE

02:26:46.331 --> 02:26:48.867 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:26:47.699 --> 02:26:50.669 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK NOT BECAUSE THAT

02:26:48.867 --> 02:26:51.202 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND BECAUSE

02:26:50.669 --> 02:26:52.437 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HAVE TO EACH OF

02:26:51.202 --> 02:26:54.172 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:26:52.437 --> 02:26:56.174 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE OF ORGANIZATION'S I

02:26:54.172 --> 02:26:57.075 region:rollup2
SHOULD STATE AND GOVERNMENT.

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:59.077 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

02:26:57.075 --> 02:26:59.944 region:rollup2
CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND OTHER

02:26:59.077 --> 02:27:01.613 region:rollup2
ACTIONS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:03.114 region:rollup2
PROPER REMEDY.

02:27:01.613 --> 02:27:04.616 region:rollup2
FOR THESE REASONS WE STILL MUST

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:05.917 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL

02:27:04.616 --> 02:27:07.118 region:rollup2

RESPECT TO.

02:27:57.569 --> 02:28:00.905 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THE OPPOSITION KIND

02:27:59.637 --> 02:28:02.674 region:rollup2
OF LOOKING TO CONGRESS AND THE

02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:04.209 region:rollup2
FEDERAL.

02:28:02.674 --> 02:28:05.810 region:rollup2
AGENCIES TO HELP ADDRESS THIS

02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:07.379 region:rollup2
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN SOME

02:28:05.810 --> 02:28:08.780 region:rollup2
WAYS A LOT OF PROGRESS BEING

02:28:07.379 --> 02:28:11.249 region:rollup2
MADE THERE YET WE ARE LEFT IN

02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:13.685 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO PROTECT.

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:16.588 region:rollup2
OUR OWN INDIVIDUALS AND AND

02:28:13.685 --> 02:28:17.055 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE SUFFERED

02:28:16.588 --> 02:28:18.056 region:rollup2
IN POTENTIALLY SUFFER

02:28:17.055 --> 02:28:19.591 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY.

02:28:18.056 --> 02:28:21.092 region:rollup2
FROM SOME OF THAT THE DATA

02:28:19.591 --> 02:28:22.761 region:rollup2
BREACHES AND OFTENTIMES

02:28:21.092 --> 02:28:24.195 region:rollup2
COMPANIES DON'T TAKE IT VERY

02:28:22.761 --> 02:28:25.797 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY TOO OFTEN THERE WAS A

02:28:24.195 --> 02:28:26.898 region:rollup2
PATCH OF.

02:28:25.797 --> 02:28:29.501 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WASN'T IMPLEMENTED

02:28:26.898 --> 02:28:30.902 region:rollup2
AND I'D.

02:28:29.501 --> 02:28:32.537 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE BECAUSE

02:28:30.902 --> 02:28:34.172 region:rollup2
ARE OFTEN PATCHES THAT ARE QUITE

02:28:32.537 --> 02:28:35.440 region:rollup2
AS STABLE I WOULD HOPE COMPANIES

02:28:34.172 --> 02:28:36.941 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD NOT RELEASED

02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:38.610 region:rollup2
SOFTWARE PATCHES THAT THAT HAVE

02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:40.178 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY TESTED. BUT

02:28:38.610 --> 02:28:42.881 region:rollup2
IN AN ENTERPRISE ROUND THAT

02:28:40.178 --> 02:28:44.182 region:rollup2
OFTEN SOMETIMES IS AN ISSUE AND

02:28:42.881 --> 02:28:46.217 region:rollup2
SO MAYBE THERE IS THERE IS SOME

02:28:44.182 --> 02:28:47.852 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY THERE OR WERE WAYS

02:28:46.217 --> 02:28:49.287 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THAT IF A LARGE

02:28:47.852 --> 02:28:51.489 region:rollup2
ENTERPRISE.

02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:53.158 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO.

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:54.592 region:rollup2
TO TEST AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT

02:28:53.158 --> 02:28:56.261 region:rollup2
IF THEY ARE RAISING THAT ISSUE.

02:28:54.592 --> 02:28:57.796 region:rollup2
THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

02:28:56.261 --> 02:28:59.798 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PATCH NEED TO TAKE THAT

02:28:57.796 --> 02:29:01.566 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY AND GET. A REPLACEMENT

02:28:59.798 --> 02:29:04.702 region:rollup2
IN AND AND ULTIMATELY SOLVE THAT

02:29:01.566 --> 02:29:05.804 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. BUT TO JUST IGNORE

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:07.505 region:rollup2
UPGRADING SOFTWARE IS

02:29:05.804 --> 02:29:08.473 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TO NOT TAKE AN

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:10.141 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE STEP WHEN THERE'S AN

02:29:08.473 --> 02:29:11.075 region:rollup2
A A VULNERABILITY THAT HAS BEEN

02:29:10.141 --> 02:29:13.111 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:14.345 region:rollup2
SHOULD NO LONGER BE EXCUSABLE

02:29:13.111 --> 02:29:16.114 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COMES UP

02:29:14.345 --> 02:29:20.084 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AND IN THE

02:29:16.114 --> 02:29:20.084 region:rollup2
EQUIFAX ROUND WE KEEP LEARNING.

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:23.354 region:rollup2
AND SO MANY COMPANIES THAT JUST

02:29:21.786 --> 02:29:24.923 region:rollup2
WANNA SAY LOOK THIS REALLY ISN'T

02:29:23.354 --> 02:29:26.524 region:rollup2
OUR PROBLEM AND FACT ARE

02:29:24.923 --> 02:29:29.394 region:rollup2
LOBBYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:31.262 region:rollup2
NOW FOR COMPLETE COMMUNITIES?

02:29:29.394 --> 02:29:33.031 region:rollup2
FROM THESE KINDS OF THESE KINDS

02:29:31.262 --> 02:29:34.732 region:rollup2
OF BRIDGES AND YET THERE'S REAL

02:29:33.031 --> 02:29:36.601 region:rollup2
COST INDIVIDUALS TO OUR

02:29:34.732 --> 02:29:38.336 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENTS. WHEN THERE'S A

TWEETING OR FINE TUNING SOME OF

02:30:41.065 --> 02:30:43.902 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE INCLUDING THE WORD

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:45.403 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT I THINK THE INTENT

02:30:43.902 --> 02:30:47.205 region:rollup2
THERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:30:45.403 --> 02:30:48.806 region:rollup2
GET THE BALL ROLLING ONCE. ONCE

02:30:47.205 --> 02:30:49.340 region:rollup2
THE ENTITY FINDS OUT THAT

02:30:48.806 --> 02:30:50.041 region:rollup2
THERE'S OF ON ABILITY AND

02:30:49.340 --> 02:30:51.309 region:rollup2
THERE'S A FIX

02:30:50.041 --> 02:30:52.610 region:rollup2
TO GET THE BALL ROLLING WHETHER

02:30:51.309 --> 02:30:54.412 region:rollup2
IT'S THREE DAYS OR WHATEVER IT

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:56.648 region:rollup2
THE DAY IT IS. ARE WE REMAIN

02:30:54.412 --> 02:30:58.116 region:rollup2
VERY FLEXIBLE ON SOME OF THE.

02:30:56.648 --> 02:30:59.817 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE SUGGESTIONS BEING

02:30:58.116 --> 02:31:01.920 region:rollup2
MADE THE REALITY IS THAT WE WE

02:30:59.817 --> 02:31:03.388 region:rollup2
HAVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION

02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:05.423 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IS INFORMATION THAT'S

02:31:03.388 --> 02:31:07.225 region:rollup2
BEING COMPROMISED. AND YES THERE

02:31:05.423 --> 02:31:09.494 region:rollup2
ARE A FEDERAL LAWS OUT THERE

02:31:07.225 --> 02:31:11.029 region:rollup2
THAT PROTECT US ALL CERTAIN ALL

02:31:09.494 --> 02:31:12.530 region:rollup2

02:31:11.029 --> 02:31:14.432 region:rollup2
OF THOSE LAWS ACTUALLY PERTAIN

02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:16.067 region:rollup2
TO APPLYING ANY PATCHES. AND

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:17.802 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO TIMELINE AS WELL SO I

02:31:16.067 --> 02:31:19.437 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO FORCE

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:21.739 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF TIME

02:31:19.437 --> 02:31:22.674 region:rollup2
LINE SAY THAT THE COMPANIES ARE

YOU KNOW VERY HARD CRITERIA TO

AND THEY ARE YOU KNOW AND IT

02:31:32.083 --> 02:31:34.752 region:rollup2
ALSO THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE

02:31:33.484 --> 02:31:36.020 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THAT ONCE A

02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:37.789 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY HAS HAS BEEN

02:31:36.020 --> 02:31:39.591 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED AND THEY. ARE THEY

02:31:37.789 --> 02:31:41.459 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRED TO START ASSESSING

02:31:39.591 --> 02:31:42.760 region:rollup2
THE SITUATION SO THERE'S NO NEED

02:31:41.459 --> 02:31:43.861 region:rollup2

COULD EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:50.969 region:rollup2
THAT PATCH IS ACTUALLY SUITABLE

02:31:49.901 --> 02:31:52.370 region:rollup2
OR APPROPRIATE FOR THAT

02:31:50.969 --> 02:31:53.771 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SYSTEM SO THERE'S A

02:31:52.370 --> 02:31:55.306 region:rollup2

02:35:10.434 --> 02:35:12.870 region:rollup2
CAN'T GET FINANCING.

02:35:11.536 --> 02:35:14.505 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS WERE

02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:16.107 region:rollup2
YOU MAYBE HAVE AN ALL CASH BUYER

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:18.309 region:rollup2
AND THEY COME IN WHEN THAT

02:35:16.107 --> 02:35:19.977 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL GOES TO SELL THEIR

02:35:18.309 --> 02:35:21.779 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO. I THINK

02:35:19.977 --> 02:35:24.282 region:rollup2
ABOUT BEING A BLIND TO GET BYERS

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:24.849 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEIR BUYERS ARE GOING

02:35:24.282 --> 02:35:25.283 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO GET GOVERNMENT

02:35:24.849 --> 02:35:26.384 region:rollup2
FINANCING.

02:35:25.283 --> 02:35:28.085 region:rollup2
SO FOR THOSE REASONS.

02:35:26.384 --> 02:35:29.921 region:rollup2
WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

02:35:28.085 --> 02:35:31.022 region:rollup2
BAN THESE ON A GO FORWARD BASIS

02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:32.590 region:rollup2

PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES.

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:38.029 region:rollup2
BAND THOSE BECAUSE GOVERNMENT

02:35:36.794 --> 02:35:39.831 region:rollup2
FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE THANK

02:41:00.684 --> 02:41:03.320 region:rollup2
RUNS ESSENTIALLY WITH AWAY AND

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:04.288 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S WORTH ASKING THE

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.923 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND IT'S WORTH

02:41:04.288 --> 02:41:07.658 region:rollup2
CLARIFYING AS WE MOVE THROUGH IT

02:41:05.923 --> 02:41:08.292 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE AUTHOR IS. FINE

02:41:07.658 --> 02:41:10.694 region:rollup2
WITH THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO

02:41:08.292 --> 02:41:12.263 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN WHY. THIS WAS.

02:41:10.694 --> 02:41:13.864 region:rollup2
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE

02:41:12.263 --> 02:41:15.266 region:rollup2
NEED TO DEAL WITH IN CALIFORNIA

02:41:13.864 --> 02:41:17.801 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CITY'S

02:41:15.266 --> 02:41:19.470 region:rollup2
CROPPING UP BUT STILL ALLOW FOR.

02:41:17.801 --> 02:41:22.173 region:rollup2
WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS FOR

02:41:19.470 --> 02:41:24.341 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

02:41:22.173 --> 02:41:25.843 region:rollup2
SOME BROADER COMMUNITY BENEFIT?

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:27.411 region:rollup2
IN THROUGH MITIGATION FEES ARE

02:41:25.843 --> 02:41:28.846 region:rollup2
ONGOING MITIGATION FEES AS

PROPERTIES MOVE THAT'S WHAT WAS

02:41:28.846 --> 02:41:32.716 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED THAT'S A STRUCTURE

02:41:30.814 --> 02:41:34.151 region:rollup2
THINK WE WANT TO MAINTAIN A

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:35.319 region:rollup2
THROUGH THROUGH BILL BUT THEN

02:41:34.151 --> 02:41:37.288 region:rollup2
GET RID OF THESE.

02:41:35.319 --> 02:41:38.389 region:rollup2
UNKNOWN.

02:41:37.288 --> 02:41:39.557 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE REALLY IS NO

02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:40.691 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BENEFIT THERE'S NO

02:41:39.557 --> 02:41:43.260 region:rollup2
PUBLIC BENEFIT THERE'S NO IT'S

02:41:40.691 --> 02:41:43.794 region:rollup2
JUST SOMEBODY WHO WHO FIGURED

02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.329 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO BUILD INTO THE

02:41:43.794 --> 02:41:47.097 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE?

02:41:45.329 --> 02:41:48.399 region:rollup2
BUY SELL THIS HOUSE AND IF

02:41:47.097 --> 02:41:49.333 region:rollup2
ANYBODY EVER CELLS THIS HOUSE

02:41:48.399 --> 02:41:51.001 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA GET SOMETHING IN MY

02:41:49.333 --> 02:41:51.468 region:rollup2
POCKETBOOK. THAT.

02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:53.137 region:rollup2

UNDERSTAND.

02:41:53.137 --> 02:41:57.074 region:rollup2

THAT THIS BILL IS IS IS

02:42:04.582 --> 02:42:07.885 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE IN ITS CONSTRUCT BUT

02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:09.453 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY THIS COMMITTEE THE

02:42:07.885 --> 02:42:10.955 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS IS WHAT IT IS I THINK

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:12.723 region:rollup2

TERMS OF.

02:43:12.383 --> 02:43:17.154 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION AND THOSE SORTS OF

02:43:14.018 --> 02:43:19.456 region:rollup2
THINGS. UP BECAUSE AT THE

02:43:17.154 --> 02:43:21.358 region:rollup2
FEDERAL STATUTE WHICH DEFINES

02:43:19.456 --> 02:43:22.493 region:rollup2
WELL REGULATION THAT THE FINES

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:24.228 region:rollup2

02:43:22.493 --> 02:43:26.664 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T REALLY.

02:43:24.228 --> 02:43:28.365 region:rollup2
ALTER THAT BECAUSE IF WE DO.

02:43:26.664 --> 02:43:29.733 region:rollup2
WE CHANGE THE LANGUAGE OF IT AND

02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:31.368 region:rollup2
STATE LAW WE COULD BE IN A

02:43:29.733 --> 02:43:33.070 region:rollup2

ARE NOT TAKING THAT IS VALID AND

02:43:35.205 --> 02:43:37.775 region:rollup2
THEN WE HAVEN'T CURED THE

02:43:35.906 --> 02:43:39.510 region:rollup2
PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT

02:43:37.775 --> 02:43:40.044 region:rollup2
HOME BUYERS AND SELLERS THAT OUR

02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:41.378 region:rollup2

02:43:41.378 --> 02:43:44.515 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT.

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:46.016 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS THAT THEY CAN'T

02:43:44.515 --> 02:43:47.651 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR LENDING.

02:43:46.016 --> 02:43:49.286 region:rollup2
THAT'S BACKED BY BY FANNIE AND

02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:50.220 region:rollup2
FREDDIE SO BUT BUT THAT

02:43:49.286 --> 02:43:52.690 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

02:43:50.220 --> 02:43:54.358 region:rollup2

PROTECT THE BURNED COMMUNITY OR

02:44:00.030 --> 02:44:02.1000 region:rollup2
ADJACENT CONTIGUOUS PROPERTIES I

02:44:01.832 --> 02:44:04.868 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THE DEFINITIONS

02:44:02.1000 --> 02:44:08.038 region:rollup2
COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR.

02:44:04.868 --> 02:44:09.606 region:rollup2
INCORPORATING SOME SORT OF.

02:44:08.038 --> 02:44:11.108 region:rollup2
EASE MENTOR WHATEVER IT WOULD BE

02:44:09.606 --> 02:44:12.376 region:rollup2
THAT RUNS WITH THE LAND THAT.

02:44:11.108 --> 02:44:13.877 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF

02:44:12.376 --> 02:44:15.646 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY PARK FOR EXAMPLE OR

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:17.481 region:rollup2
CONSERVATION OF OPEN SPACE OR

02:44:15.646 --> 02:44:18.782 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I I DON'T

02:44:17.481 --> 02:44:20.117 region:rollup2
THINK I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS

02:44:18.782 --> 02:44:21.018 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS.

02:44:20.117 --> 02:44:22.553 region:rollup2
RAISING THAT BUT I I DON'T

02:44:21.018 --> 02:44:23.554 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:44:22.553 --> 02:44:25.656 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE REALLY SIMPLY TRYING

02:44:23.554 --> 02:44:27.358 region:rollup2
TO DO IS?

02:44:25.656 --> 02:44:29.026 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT THE CHAIR SAID AS.

02:44:27.358 --> 02:44:30.828 region:rollup2
BAN PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES IN

02:44:29.026 --> 02:44:32.663 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

02:44:30.828 --> 02:44:34.465 region:rollup2
LIKE FORTY OF THE FORTY THREE

02:44:32.663 --> 02:44:35.632 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. THAT ARE

02:44:34.465 --> 02:44:37.034 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY JUST DEFERRED PROFIT

02:44:35.632 --> 02:44:38.302 region:rollup2
FOR BUILDERS

02:44:37.034 --> 02:44:39.903 region:rollup2
THAT THEY GET TWO PERCENT OF THE

02:44:38.302 --> 02:44:41.638 region:rollup2
SALE.

02:44:39.903 --> 02:44:43.907 region:rollup2
IN PERPETUITY EVERYTIME

02:44:41.638 --> 02:44:45.509 region:rollup2
THE THE PROPERTIES TURNED OVER.

02:44:43.907 --> 02:44:47.378 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S REALLY THAT DOESN'T

02:44:45.509 --> 02:44:49.213 region:rollup2
GO TO ANYTHING THAT'S BENEFICIAL

02:44:47.378 --> 02:44:51.115 region:rollup2
FOR ANY HOMEOWNER AND REALLY

02:44:49.213 --> 02:44:52.316 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND. AS I GOT

02:44:51.115 --> 02:44:54.218 region:rollup2
INTO THIS ISSUE AND STUDY THAT I

02:44:52.316 --> 02:44:56.086 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S A.

02:44:54.218 --> 02:44:56.854 region:rollup2
IT IT'S A PRETTY BIG PROBLEM.

02:44:56.086 --> 02:44:58.856 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

02:44:56.854 --> 02:45:00.557 region:rollup2
PROTECTING BUYERS AND SELLERS.

02:44:58.856 --> 02:45:01.558 region:rollup2
AND THEN I THINK THE WITNESS HAD

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:03.394 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS ON THE IDEA I JUST

02:45:01.558 --> 02:45:05.229 region:rollup2
WANTED TO ADD THAT THE BILL OF

02:45:03.394 --> 02:45:06.130 region:rollup2
SPEAKS TO A PUBLIC TRANSIT FEES

02:45:05.229 --> 02:45:08.332 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED.

02:45:06.130 --> 02:45:09.500 region:rollup2
AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY

02:45:08.332 --> 02:45:10.634 region:rollup2
NINETEEN.

02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:13.737 region:rollup2
NOW I THINK THE POINT THAT THE

02:45:10.634 --> 02:45:15.139 region:rollup2
OPPONENTS OF RAISING IS AS NOT

02:45:13.737 --> 02:45:17.107 region:rollup2
LAWRENCE. WELK THAT'S RIGHT

02:45:15.139 --> 02:45:17.608 region:rollup2
CONCERNS THAT CERTAIN FATTY

02:45:17.107 --> 02:45:18.408 region:rollup2
FOODS.

02:45:17.608 --> 02:45:20.644 region:rollup2
WHERE?

02:45:18.408 --> 02:45:22.346 region:rollup2
?

02:45:20.644 --> 02:45:23.914 region:rollup2
AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN EVEN

02:45:22.346 --> 02:45:25.883 region:rollup2
POINT OUT THESE THINGS OPERATE

02:45:23.914 --> 02:45:28.585 region:rollup2
IN PERPETUITY SO I THINK WHAT I

02:45:25.883 --> 02:45:30.521 region:rollup2
HEAR BEING SAID IS THAT WHEN.

02:45:28.585 --> 02:45:34.091 region:rollup2
THIRD GENERATION FOR GENERATION

02:45:30.521 --> 02:45:35.659 region:rollup2
IS THAT BEING ESTABLISHED A NEW.

02:45:34.091 --> 02:45:36.760 region:rollup2
AND IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT

02:45:35.659 --> 02:45:38.228 region:rollup2
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.898 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED AT THE OUTSET AND

02:45:38.228 --> 02:45:43.534 region:rollup2
THEN EVERY TIME THAT YOU HAVE A

02:45:40.898 --> 02:45:45.536 region:rollup2
SALE THAT'S NOT REESTABLISHED.

02:45:43.534 --> 02:45:47.371 region:rollup2
IT IT GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

02:45:45.536 --> 02:45:48.472 region:rollup2
DATE. THAT MAKE SOME SENSE YEAH

02:45:47.371 --> 02:45:50.340 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

02:45:48.472 --> 02:45:51.241 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT YEAH YEAH THAT IF AND

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.976 region:rollup2
IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT.

02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:54.978 region:rollup2
OKAY AND

02:45:52.976 --> 02:45:56.079 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT I JUST CLARIFY I THINK

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:57.381 region:rollup2
THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT TO HONE

02:45:56.079 --> 02:45:59.249 region:rollup2
RANCHES

02:45:57.381 --> 02:46:00.651 region:rollup2
YOU NO PHASE DEVELOPMENT AND SO

02:45:59.249 --> 02:46:02.286 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE HOMES HAVE EVEN BEEN

02:46:00.651 --> 02:46:04.421 region:rollup2
BUILT YET. SO IT'S NOT A MATTER

02:46:02.286 --> 02:46:05.456 region:rollup2
OF THE RESALE IT'S THE FACT THAT

02:46:04.421 --> 02:46:06.623 region:rollup2
AS THEY ARE SOLD WITH THIS

02:46:05.456 --> 02:46:07.891 region:rollup2
IMPACT

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:09.693 region:rollup2
FEET RIGHT AND MY UNDERSTANDING

02:46:07.891 --> 02:46:10.394 region:rollup2
IS THAT FEE IS TIED TO A

02:46:09.693 --> 02:46:12.162 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC DATE.

02:46:10.394 --> 02:46:14.331 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL

SO THAT PROGRAM WAS CREATED.

02:46:15.866 --> 02:46:19.269 region:rollup2
BEFOREHAND SO EVEN IF THAT
