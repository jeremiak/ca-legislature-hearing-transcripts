SO -- WE WILL BE TAKING ACTION ON ANYTHING JUST HAVING A DISCUSSION. OF AND SO AS A RESULT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A QUORUM A CALL ROLE BUT I DID WANT TO WAIT TO AT LEAST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE SOME GROUND OVER THE I'LL. ARRIVE OF DISCUSSIONS THAT OUR SUBCOMMITTEES TYPICALLY FOCUS ON PRISONS AND COURTS BUT AS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY. WE ALSO COVER HOW THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. SUPPORT CITIES AND COUNTIES IN COORDINATING RESOURCES AND SERVICES IN TIMES OF DISASTER. IN THE LAST YEAR OUR STATE HAS INTO UNPRECEDENTED NATURAL DISASTERS THAT HAVE CAUSED DEVASTATION TO CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE. WHILE WE CAN CALCULATE THE LOSS OF PHYSICAL STRUCTURES THE COST OF LIVES LOST IS IN IMMEASURABLE. ONE THIS NEW REALITY IS SOMETHING THAT AS A STATE WE CAN BETTER BE PREPARED FOR AND WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. TO ENSURE THAT EFFICIENT COORDINATION AND ADEQUATE RESOURCES I FIT EFFICIENTLY DELIVERED WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. TODAY WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL CITY AND COUNTY. AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THAT COORDINATION HAPPENS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WHO RIDE ON THE EYES AND TO IMPROVE DISASTER RELEASE AND RESPONSE. I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF THE MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS. SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN HOW GREAT OKAY AT THIS TIME WE DO HAVE A PANEL IN THE PANELIST ARE HELEN KIRSTINE WHO IS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OKAY SOMEONE FROM TWO PEOPLE FROM THE DIRECTOR WHO'S FROM THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT. OFFICE OF B. EMERGENCY SERVICES AND YOU'LL GIVE US YOUR NAMES WHEN YOU START SOUNDS GOOD. ARRAY RIORDAN IS ALSO HERE WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS SERVICE ASSOCIATION AND THE REST OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND HOLLY HOWARD WHO IS ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ARE WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN WITH OUR I THINK WITH THE DIRECTORS. GOING TO SPEAK FIRST I'M SORRY. OUR LEGISLATIVE ALICE IS GOING TO SPEAK FIRST AND THEN WE'LL GO TO THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRED MEMBERS MY NAME IS TELLING CHRISTINE NOT JUST LAID OF ANALYST'S OFFICE SO YOU SHOULD HAVE A HAND OUT IN FRONT OF YOU THAT THE SERGEANTS PASSED OUT THAT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ONLINE. AND THAT WILL -- GUIDE MY REMARKS THIS AFTERNOON SO I'M GONNA SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- YES HIS ROLE RELATED TO DISASTERS EMERGENCIES I MEAN AT FIRST JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THEIR ROLE I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL BECAUSE THEY ARE HERE TO PROVIDE. MORE OF AN IN DEPTH. DESCRIPTION OF THEIR ROLE AS WELL AS I'M SOME DISCUSSION OF THAT THEIR ROLE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE RECENT DISASTERS -- BUT I'M JUST GONNA BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THAT AND THEN I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET ACTIONS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TAKEN --% RELATED TO DISASTERS AND EMERGENCY -- ITEMS -- FOR YES ITS BUDGET AS WELL AS SOME OF COVER SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT WILL BE IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET -- AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING THOSE FURTHER AT AN UPCOMING HEARING BUT I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON THOSE SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE. ONE WE COVER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO DISASTERS AND WE REALLY DIVIDE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES INTO FOUR MAIN AREAS -- IN THIS HANDOUT YOU CAN KIND OF SLICE AND DICE THEM DIFFERENT WAYS BUT REALLY HOWEVER YOU LOOK AT IT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN DISASTERS SORT OF FROM BEGINNING TO END ACTUALLY EVEN BEFORE DISASTER STARTS TO WELL AFTER THE DISASTER OCCURS. SO THE FIRST THING THAT THEY'RE INVOLVED IN WAS RELATED TO PLANNING. A SO THEY PREPARE VARIOUS STATE PLANS RELATED TO DISASTERS INCLUDING THE STATE'S HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN WHICH IDENTIFIES SOME OF THEM MADE. HAZARD WE HAVE THE STATE LIKE EARTHQUAKES WILDFIRES AND FLOODS WERE WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT -- HAZARDS IN THE STATE AS WELL AS WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE. THEY ALSO PREPARE THE STATE'S DISASTER PLAN AND THEY ALSO SUPPORT LOCAL ENTITIES AS WELL AS OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND THE PREPARATION OF THEIR PLANNING ACTIVITIES. THE SECOND MAJOR FUNCTION THAT WE COVER HERE IS COMMUNICATIONS SO THE DEPARTMENT DOES A NUMBER OF THINGS RELATED TO COMMUNICATIONS THEY FACILITATE EMERGENCY WARNINGS. THEY ALSO -- SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION EFFORTS I'M GONNA CALL IT JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT THEY DO THE ACTUAL DUE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN THIS AREA -- BUT A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WILL COME BACK TO LATER IN THE HAND OUT INCLUDING. AYE SUPPORTING THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM IT IS A SYSTEM THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IS DESIGNED TO GIVE PEOPLE ADVANCE WARNING OF AN UPCOMING EARTHQUAKE. ID ALSO. PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE STATE'S NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM SO FOLKS CAN CALL IN IN THE EVENT OF A DISASTER AND SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM REGENCY RESPONDERS. AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY RADIO SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS FIRST RESPONDERS TO CONTACT EACH OTHER AND COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER I'M IN TIMES OF A DISASTER AS WELL AS OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. THE THIRD MAIN FUNCTION THAT THEY PERFORM IS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY AND THEY REALLY MONITORING COORDINATE THE RESPONSE RECOVERY EFFORTS OF THE STATE. AND THAT INCLUDES FOR EXAMPLE TASKING OTHER DEPARTMENTS -- WITH RESPONDING SO FOR EXAMPLE IF WE NEED TECH COLLINS MEDICINAL SUPPORT FROM THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHICH IS ALSO HEARD IN THE SUB COMMITTEE THEY WOULD BE THE ONE WHO ATTACKED THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WITH COMING IN PROVIDING THAT ASSISTANCE. THEY ALSO COORDINATE THE STATE'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AND THIS IS A SYSTEM OF NEIGHBOR HELPING NEIGHBOR WHERE ONE COMMUNITY IF THEY'RE OVERWHELMS I'M CAN GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM OTHER JURISDICTIONS EITHER WITHIN THE STATE OR IN SOME CASES IN THE EVENT OF A VERY MAJOR DISASTER SOMETIMES EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE STATE -- I ALSO WANTED TO JUST POINT OUT IN THIS AREA THAT THEY HAVE SOME FIRE ENGINES THAT OUR STATE ON FIRE ENGINES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OFFER USING MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WILL COME BACK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN -- PROVIDED IN PAST YEARS AND SO THEY FACILITATE. THE PROVISION OF THOSE ENGINES AND AND THE COORDINATION OF THOSE ENGINES AS WELL. AND THEN THE FOURTH MAJOR ACTIVITY IS THE ADMINISTRATION OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE FUNDING -- BASTER IS BASICALLY THE CONDUIT FOR STATE ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS FEDERAL ASSISTANCE -- AND THEIR COUPLE KEY KINDS OF ASSISTANCE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IN TERMS OF STATE ASSISTANCE. ONE OF THE MAJOR -- AREAS A STATE ASSISTANCE IS THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT AND THIS IS A FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED TO HELP PREPARE A PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S PROVIDED TO HELP LOCALS FOR EXAMPLE -- A COVER SOME OF THE COSTS RELATED TO DISASTER RESPONSE AS WELL -- AGAIN WILL COME BACK TO THIS WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP IN MIND ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO VERY LARGE DISASTERS. SO WHEN THE STATE EXPERIENCES DISASTERS OF THE SCALE WITH EXPERIENCE UNFORTUNATELY A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE CAN SOMETIMES GET WHAT'S CALLED A MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MAKES AVAILABLE A VARIETY OF TYPES OF FEDERAL FUNDING INCLUDING FOR THINGS LIKE FIRE RESPONSE DEBRIS REMOVAL -- ALSO IT HELPS. I STILL WITH OTHER THINGS LIKE REBUILDING PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE -- AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM THAT IT MAKES AVAILABLE WHICH I'M GONNA ALSO COME BACK TO LATER BUT I WANT TO JUST MENTION IT QUICKLY HERE. IT'S CALLED THE DISASTER THE HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM. AND THIS PROGRAM IS AT EIGHT BECAUSE BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IT IS WITH THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED VERY SIGNIFICANT DISASTERS IT PROVIDES FUNDING TO HELP US MITIGATE FUTURE DISASTERS. SO UP 220% OF THE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE WE GET FOR SHIP RESPONDING TO REBUILDING FROM THE DISASTER WE CAN GET -- IN THE FORM OF ASSISTANCE TO HELP US. REALLY BE MORE RESILIENT TO FUTURE DISASTERS. SO JUST ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS TYPICALLY WITH FEDERAL GADIS FEDERAL DISASTER FUNDS IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COVERS ABOUT 75% OF THE COST USUALLY THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COVER THE REMAINING 25% ALTHOUGH THAT CAN VARY. DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO WE SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED THE LAST FEW YEARS THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE. THE FUNDING IT'S BEEN PROVIDED THROUGH -- AS CURRENT YOUR ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE DISASTER RESPONSE IN ECONOMIC -- OR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT EXCUSE ME -- THIS IS JUST THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A FOR EXAMPLE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT THIS SUMMARIZES SUMMER IT SUMMARIZES THOSE AUGMENTATIONS AND THERE'S A LOT GOING IN ON IN THIS CHART I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH EVERY ITEM BECAUSE IT'S IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT BUT I WANT. TO POINT OUT A FEW THEMES THAT YOU SEE HERE THINGS THAT WE'VE FUNDED A COUPLE OF TIMES IN RECENT YEARS ONE IS CDA ACTIVE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT -- WHICH I MENTIONED BEFORE WE PROVIDED BUT ONE TIME AND SOME ON GOING AUGMENTATIONS RELATED TO CD A IN RECENT YEARS IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ANOTHER MAJOR THEME IS FIRE ENGINES -- AND ALL AGAIN MULTIPLE TIMES IN RECENT YEARS AND IN ALL THESE YEARS ACTUALLY PROVIDED SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING EITHER -- FOR BUYING ADDITIONAL ENGINES OR AND OR FOR PRE POSITIONING MUTUAL AID ENGINES SO ACTUALLY IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AS PART OF THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT. PROPOSAL THAT WAS TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ENGINES ON A NISSAN MANY FOR PRE POSITIONING AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS MANY IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR BOTH. OB PURCHASING ADDITIONAL ENGINES AS WELL AS PRE POSITIONING. AT ANOTHER MAJOR THEME YOU'LL SEE A MULTIPLE YEARS OF FUNDING FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM MOST OF THAT WAS PROVIDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO BUILD OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THAT SYSTEM -- AND THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RELATED PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL OR THAT WERE PRE OF THAT YOU'LL SEE HERE. I WON I WON A COTTON SPECIFICALLY IS THE NINE ONE ONE SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS CONSIDERED BY THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR AND APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT FINDS AN UPGRADE OF THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE NEXT GEN NINE ONE SYSTEM. OUT OF A SPECIAL FUNDS -- AND THERE'S SOME STRUCTURAL IMBALANCES BATTLE BUT ON THE NEXT PAGE. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE WE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PACKAGE THE FIRST TO I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO MUCH DETAIL THOSE WERE BOTH INCLUDED AS PART OF AB SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. ON THERE IS SOME MONEY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION AS WELL AS A GENERAL FUND LOAN IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO SUPPORT THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM -- AND THEN IN NINETEEN TWENTY YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS -- WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE -- AT AN UPCOMING HEARING I BELIEVE I'VE JUST BRIEFLY GOING TO SUMMARIZE SOME OF THOSE -- THERE SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING INCREASE THE FEDERAL TRUST FUND AT THE ALREADY. I RELATED TO THAT HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED SO THIS THE STATE IS -- EXPECTING TO RECEIVE A BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIS PROGRAM. SO THAT COULD BE A BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE CAN INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO HELP THEM BE MORE RESILIENT TO POTENTIAL DISASTERS WHETHER IT BE HARDENING BUILDINGS FOR EARTHQUAKES IN MAKING THE MORE -- STRENGTH STRONGER FOR EARTHQUAKES OR CREATING DEFENSIBLE SPACE FOR FIRES ON ALL THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS FUNDING SO THERE COULD BE A BILLION DOLLARS AND THE DEPARTMENT IS -- WORKING TOWARDS -- PROVIDING GRANTS FOR THAT FUNDING GRANTS. AT THE SECOND BULLET HERE IS RELATED TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM THERE ACTUALLY TWO SEPARATE PROPOSALS HERE WHAT IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO SET NAPA -- TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT UPGRADED TO THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM AS WELL AS JUST SUPPORT THE EXISTING SYSTEM. ON BECAUSE OF THAT FUND CONDITION ISSUE I MENTIONED THERE'S ALSO A SEPARATE PROPOSAL FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT WHAT'S CALLED IS WHAT'S CALLED FIRST NAT. ON WHICH IS CONSERVE A BACKBONE BROADBAND -- TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT THE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. THERE'S ALSO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND THAT WOULD ON AN ONGOING BASIS SUPPORT THE PRE POSITIONING OF THOSE ENGINES SO WE'VE FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS IN PAST YEARS IN THIS WOULD BE ON GOING FUNDING. THERE'S ALSO A PROPOSAL FOR ONE TIME FUNDING FOR CDA -- SO WE'VE PROVIDED SO AS I MENTIONED BEFORE SOME PAST FUNDING IN THIS WOULD BE I AM% ANOTHER YEAR FUNDING FOR THAT FUNDING AUGMENTATION FOR THAT. PROBABLY REFLECTS JUST THAT THE GROWING AMOUNT OF DISASTERS WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. THERE'S ALSO -- SOMEONE TIME FINDING SIXTEEN MILLION PROPOSED FOR THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEM THAT WILL BASICALLY COMPLETE THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER SAID ONE TIME COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SYSTEM -- AND NOT NEED TO BE AN ONGOING FUNDING SO FINDING SOLUTION DEVELOPED FOR THAT SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE ON GOING COST -- THAT WILL ALSO COME ABOUT IS PART OF THAT SYSTEM. AND IN THE LAST -- I ITEM I WANNA HIGHLIGHTED THE PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS THERE'S A MULTI YEAR FUNDING PROPOSAL RELATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS -- AND REALLY OPERATING THAT SYSTEM TO ME IT'LL AND ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY TO THAT SYSTEM. SO THOSE ARE REALLY THE KEY BUDGET ITEMS OF NOTE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS -- MAYBE EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT MUCH OF A REAL QUICK ONE IF I COULD GET. YOU SAID THAT OF A BILLION DOLLARS. WAS COMING. TO HELP MITIGATE THESE -- PROPOSALS. BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT. DID I MISUNDERSTAND THAT WEARS YEAH INCOME FROM SO THERE'S A BILL THERE'S WE'RE EXPECTING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS YOU'RE NOT GONNA SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS WHY. ONE THE DEPARTMENT HAS A BASE BUDGET AMOUNT TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS AND SO AND THAT'S QUITE SUBSTANTIAL SO THEY CAN ALREADY RECEIVED QUITE A BIT OF FEDERAL FUNDS WITHOUT A BUDGET AUGMENTATION. AND THEN ALSO THE SIXTY MILLION IS -- AN ONGOING FUNDING -- INCREASE AND SO ACTUALLY THEY'RE EXPECTING TO RECEIVE THAT FEDERAL FUNDING -- FIND INCREASE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AND SO THEY ARE PROPOSING TO SIXTY MILLION TO ALLOW THEM TO RECEIVE IT OVER SEVERAL YEARS SO ULTIMATELY WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THAT ALL IS A BUDGET INCREASE THIS YEAR. ON BUT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT LEGISLATURE WILL BE MADE VERY SOON -- AND THEIR DIFFERENT TIMELINES FOR THE SPECIFIC ONES BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONE OF WANNA BE KEEPING AN EYE ON NOT BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM. IN THE BECOMING FOR THE FIT YES THIS IS FEDERAL FUNDING NOT STATE FUNDING. YEAH BECAUSE YOU HAVE A HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION AND THEN THIRTY MILLION OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THAT'S NOT IT QUITE CLOSE TO A BILLION YEAH NO SORRY THE BILLION -- IT'S JUST THAT'S REALLY JUST RELATED TO THAT FEDERAL TRUST THE FIRST BULLET THERE UNDER THAT ONE TWENTY THREE THAT FEDERAL TRUST FUND AUTHORITY -- INCREASE OF THE SIXTY MILLION SO BASICALLY SIXTY MILLION IT'S OFF ON GROWING FUNDING BUT THAT'S ON TOP OF THE BASE FEDERAL FUNDS AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAVE -- WHICH IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK IT'S MAYBE AROUND SIX HUNDRED MILLION SO THEY HAVE QUITE A BIT OF FEDERAL FUNDS AT FORTY IN WITH THIS AUGMENTATION THEY'RE ANTICIPATING BEING ABLE TO ACCEPT THE FULL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT DAY. ANTICIPATE RECEIVING MY UNDERSTANDING THANK YOU CAN QUE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WEBER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE MY NAME IS GRACE COKE I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE DIRECTOR OF MARKET OUR DUTY SENDS HIS APOLOGIES FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY BUT I AM PRIVILEGED -- TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR PROGRAMS.

SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO TWO DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU -- ONE OF THEM IS OUR STRATEGIC PLAN'S SUMMARY WHICH IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPDATED. AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DISCUSSION IF YOU GO TO THE CENTER FOLDER THAT DOCUMENT -- I'LL JUST BUCKET THE DESCRIPTIONS AND OVERVIEWS IN AT IN LINE WITH THAT. AND THEN -- BEHIND YOU AND PERHAPS IN FRONT OF YOU YOU HAVE A DOCUMENT THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN BEFORE IT'S SUCH JUST KIND OF HOUSE SOME OF OUR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES ARE ORGANIZED. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HOMELAND SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS. SO BRIEFLY. OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT PROPERTY LIVES AND PROPERTY BUILD CAPABILITIES AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES FOR RESILIENT CALIFORNIA WE DO THAT THROUGH A VARIETY OF OF INTER GOVERNMENTAL. COOPERATIVE RELATIONS WITH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND NONPROFITS IN ALL PHASES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. IN THE CORNER YOU HAVE MITIGATION OF PREPAREDNESS RECOVERING RESPONSES SO IT'S KIND OF THE CONTINUE ON OF NONSTOP PLANNING PREPAREDNESS RESPONDING AND RECOVERING -- SO BASICALLY -- STATE WORK COUNCIL IN NINETEEN FORTY THREE WE BECAME THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY IN TWO THOUSAND FOR A WE MERGED WITH THE OFFICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PLANNING WHICH IS WHERE AND WHEN WE GOT A LOT OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS VICTIM SERVICES PROGRAMS AND PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS. THAN A TWO THOUSAND NINE WE MERGE WITH THE OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHICH THEN ALLOWS THE DIRECTOR TO NOT ONLY BE THE EMERGENCY SERVICES EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR BUT ALSO THE HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICE AND THE ADVISER. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE MERGE WITH THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS WHICH IS A VERY LARGE GROUP I THINK HELLO OUTLINED A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THOSE AND IN SHORT ORDER. CURRENTLY WE HAVE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED PERMANENT FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND WE'VE HIRED HUNDREDS OF OTHER TEMPORARY HELP TO HELP US MEET THE NEED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OF DISASTERS -- SO IN OUR PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS DIRECTOR WHICH IS IN THE BLUE SECTION OF THE OF THE ORG CHART. THAT -- DIRECTORATE HAS STAFF AND RESOURCES WITH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN REGARD TO EMERGENCY PLANNING. UP ALSO THEY MAINTAIN OUR SYSTEMS OF EMERGENCY PLANNING AND HOW WE RESPOND INCLUDING THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE'LL HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT LATER TODAY. THEY ALSO MANAGE VERY TECHNICAL PROGRAM SO LAKE EARLY. THE EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING PROGRAM -- ALL OF OUR CATASTROPHIC DISASTER PLANNING OUR DAM EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS. HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING AND A VERY RICH ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM WHO ANNUALLY TRAINS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND FIRST RESPONDERS EMERGENCY MANAGERS. AND OTHER PROFESSIONALS IN A VARIETY OF ALL HAZARD -- A TRAINING COURSES AND AS WELL AS CREDENTIALING. IN OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY DIRECTORATE WE THEY'VE BEEN VERY BUSY AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM ERIC. BUT THAT ENCOMPASSES OUR REGIONAL WE HAVE THREE ADMINISTRATIVE REGIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- WE ALSO THAT ALSO ENCOMPASSES OUR FIRE AND RESCUE AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY AS WELL AS OUR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WARNING CENTER. AND THAT HOUSES OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AS FAR AS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF THAT TECHNOLOGY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCURATE DEPICTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON A DURING AND AFTER A DISASTER SO THE KEY THE REGIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND OUR OFFICES WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WORK WITH THEM ON PLANNING EXERCISES -- REVIEWING THEIR PLANS BUT ALSO IN DURING RESPONSE SO THEY WORK TOGETHER TO RESPOND -- TO TO DISASTERS WITH THEM AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE RECOVERY. AS HELEN MENTIONED ARE FIRE AND RESCUE MANAGES THE STATE FIRE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM AS WELL AS MAINTAIN AS EXTENSIVE PROGRAMS FOR STATE OWNED EQUIPMENT -- FIREFIGHTING CAPABILITIES WITH WATER RESCUE URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE IN A LOT OF A LOT OF OTHER FIRST RESPONDER ABOUT PROGRAMS. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HOMELAND SECURITY MANAGES THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SIDE OF MUTUAL AID AS WELL AS OTHER. MASS PLANNING ACTIVITIES THAT INVOLVE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SUCH AS CORNERS MUTUAL AID -- LARGE SADIE LARGE STADIUM SPECIAL EVENT PLANNING AND TRANSIT SECURITY. THEY ALSO -- PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THREAT AND RISK VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS. IN A RECOVERY SECTION WHICH IS -- HAS GROWN RAPIDLY OVER THE LAST ACTION THAT OVERS A LOT OF THOSE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT PROGRAMS THAT HELEN SPOKE. TO AS WELL AS THE MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM AND I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION ON THAT BILLION DOLLAR SOME OF THE NUMBERS -- HAVE GONE DOWN SO WE'RE LOOKING ANYWHERE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION IT'S DEPENDENT UPON THAT NUMBER IS DEPENDENT UPON THE TOTAL COST OF THE DISASTER FOR ELIGIBLE COSTS WHICH IS -- INFLUX SO JUST WANTED TO TO MENTION THAT IT THAT MIGHT BE CLOSER TO EIGHT HUNDRED BUT IT IS A MOVING TARGET AND THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT WAS ACCURATE IT IS OVERTIME. AND HAS TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT -- IN THAT SECTION THEY NOT ONLY PROVIDE OUR DAY TO DAY FACILITIES AND CAPITAL OUTLAY SUPPORT. THEY ALSO PROVIDE EMERGENCY LOGISTICS FOR STAGING OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE RESOURCES WATERSHED PROTECTION -- STAGING IN BASE CAMP OPERATIONS AS THAT IS WHERE OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATION WHICH IS IN THE RED SECTION OF OUR OF OUR HAND OUT OF THE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER FOR THE NEXT CHEN. NINE ONE ONE ALL OF THE NINE ONE ONE PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS. MANAGING THE STATE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE. NUMBER ACCOUNT OR THAT SPECIAL FUNDING. AS WELL AS THE FIRST RESPOND OR NETWORK A THAT'S FIRST THEY ALSO LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH OUR OF OUR STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS IN REGARD TO STATEWIDE INTER OPERABILITY COORDINATION. TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALL ABLE TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY WHEN CALLED TO A DISASTER -- AND THEY BASICALLY MAINTAIN OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY PHYSICAL SITES AND THREE HUNDRED MICROWAVE PATHS AT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRST RESPONDERS -- AND UTILITIES CAN ALL COMMUNICATE -- WHEN NEEDED DURING AN EVENT? OUR FINAL AHEAD DIRECTOR IT IS THE FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION AND THAT IS THE AREA THAT HANDLES YOUR TYPICAL ADMIT ALL OFFICES BUT ALSO -- THOSE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS VICTIM SERVICES EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PUBLIC SAFETY. SO OVERALL ABOUT TWO BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANTS -- YOU KNOW GRANTS TO A LOT OF THE NON PROFITS TO SUPPORT SOME VITAL VICTIM SERVICES PROGRAMS. WE ALSO HAVE THREE VERY SPECIAL OFFICES THAT SERVER CRITICAL ROLE IN ALL OF OUR DIRECTORATES AND THAT IS ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. OF THAT FOCUS ON DISABILITY INTEGRATION AND INCLUSION. ARE PRIVATE SECTOR NGO WHO FOCUSES IN ON INCORPORATING ALL OF OUR BUSINESS SECTOR -- PARTNERS INTO OUR PLANNING AND OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORTS. AS WELL THOSE ARE TRIBAL OFFICE TO INTEGRATE WITH ALL OF THE HUNDRED NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND OTHERS. AS WELL AS A MILITARY LIAISON -- WHEN WE EMBARK UPON THE -- SUPPORT FOR THE MILITARY. SO THAT IS KIND OF AN OVERVIEW NOT WANTING TO DUPLICATE ANY OF OF WHAT HELEN SAID BUT ALL I'D LIKE TO IN THE SEARCH ANY QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO HAVE DIFFERENT WHATEVER I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. SIR. WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THE SUN? BREAK DOWN HERE AT THE VERY VERY TOP YOU HAVE DIRECTOR GOVERNOR'S HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER YES DOES THAT INDICATE. THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A MINISTER SOME FEDERAL AUTHORITY IN THAT. IS IT ALL STATE IT'S A WELL IT'S A FEDERAL DESIGNATION THAT ALLOWS EVERY STATE HAS A OF THE DESIGNATED HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER SO OUR DIRECTOR SERVICES% THAT ROLE SO IT'S A DUAL ROLE. SO THERE IS THAT THERE IS A LOT OF COORDINATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BOTH ON HOW MUCH SECURITY AS WELL AS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT BECAUSE IT'S IT'S EQUALLY CONFUSING IS THAT YOU HAVE AT THE VERY TOP AND YOU HAVE AN OVER UNDER. THE RESPONSE SECTION. AND YOU HAVE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT HOMELAND SECURITY WAY DOWN THERE AS WELL. SO I'M CONFUSED BY THAT YET -- SO A MEMBER LACKEY I WAS GONNA. GET INTO EXPLAINING A LITTLE GREATER DETAIL FOR YOU HOW ARE THE HOMELAND SECURITY RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN A RESPONSE RECOVERY DIRECTOR IT WORKS. THE DIRECTOR SERVES AT EVERY STATE AS IT HAS A HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER OUR HOMELAND SECURITY FUNCTIONS WHICH INCLUDE OUR STATE THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER -- IN OUR STATE PRESIDENT SYSTEM ARE OVERSEEN BY CHEAP PAYS AND WHO'S HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US TODAY HE OVERSEES THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY FUNCTIONAL FEDERAL AUTHORITY. WELL WE HAVE FEDERAL WE HAVE THE FORTY TO OVERSEE GRANT DOLLARS THAT COME IN FOR BOTH A HOMELAND SECURITY FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS A MULTITUDE OF OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY COULD NOT JURISDICTIONAL AUTHORITY. WHAT WE WE COORDINATE WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS SO -- THERE'S INFORMATION WHICH OVER AND CLEAR TO ME THAT WILL WORK ON OUR THESE AND MAYBE IT MAYBE THE QUESTION IS ARE. WE ARE DIRECTOR OVER HERE IS THIS THE SAME PERSON IS DOWN AND IN THE OF THE SECTION THAT TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE THEY'RE DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHAT YES THE DOOR GO AHEAD. THIS OTHERS THE DIRECTOR WHO'S THE STATE'S HOMELAND SECURITY ADVISER AND THEN SHE PAYS IN WHO OVERSEES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT BRANCH AND OUR HOMELAND SECURITY FUNCTION. AND THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THAT HOMELAND SECURITY GROUP IS THE SHARING OF INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE FROM LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES THERE ARE FUSION CENTER OPERATIONS. OKAY. ALL RIGHT TO THE DIFFERENT INFECTIOUS THANK YOU. SO THE MORNING SO THAT TAKE TO INDICATE ON THIS SAID THAT CHART BEHIND YOU IN IN FRONT OF YOU -- THE THIRD OF THE THREE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF YES BEING -- HOMELAND SECURITY CALLOW YES ACTS AS THE DIRECTOR AXES THE GOVERNOR'S HOMELAND SECURITY -- ADVISER -- THIS HELLO YES SERVES AS THE HOME CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA STATE THREAT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SAFEGUARDS THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BY SERVING AS A DYNAMIC SECURITY NEXUS BETWEEN THE STATE'S PRIMARY FUSION CENTER IN THE FOR REGIONAL. AND ONE MAJOR URBAN AREA FUSION CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE STATE BRED ASSESSMENT CENTER THE STACKS OUR PRIMARY FUSION CENTER IS LOCATED AT CALLOW YES IT SERVES. AS AN INFORMATION CLEARINGHOUSE OF STRATEGIC THREAT ANALYSIS AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS REPORTING. AND ALSO PROVIDES A STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP ACROSS THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNITY. THE STACKS SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO PREVENT AND PREPARE FOR AND ALSO MITIGATE AND RESPOND TO ALL CRIMES AND ALL HAZARDS THAT AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S CITIZENS. AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO THERE'S A VERY COLLABORATIVE EFFORT UNDER WAY THROUGH THE STATE THREAT ASSESSMENT CENTER THAT HAS A MULTITUDE. OF OTHER STATE AGENCY PARTNERS -- OUR CHIEF IRAQ'S DIRECTLY WITH THE SPECIAL AGENTS IN CHARGE OF MULTIPLE -- FBI OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL AS COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION THROUGH OUR REGIONAL FUSION CENTERS WITH OUR REGIONAL AND FEDERAL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION AT THE CAL STAR AT THE STACK. WE HAVE COLOCATED THE SITE CALIFORNIA SIDE STACKED IN COORDINATES INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND SHARING WITH A VARIETY OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THREAT DETECTION PREVENTION. REMEDIATION RESPONSE AND RECOVERY STRATEGIES IT'S ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY. THE FOUR CORE PARTNERS IN THE CAL SEEK OUR KAHLO YES THE STATE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. I'D LIKE NOW -- AS WE'VE SORT OF LAID OT THE THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF YES TALK -- IN A LITTLE GREATER DETAIL ABOUT THE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES. THAT WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT BEFORE WE GO THERE JUST TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TIME THAT -- DIRECTOR KILLER DUDE SHE HAS SERVED AS DIRECTOR -- IT'S BEEN A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS OF OF UNFORTUNATE ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE STATE -- INCLUDING THE DROUGHT -- WHICH WAS A SIGNIFICANT. IMPACT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN THE GREATEST IMPACTS WERE SEEN AT AT ANY ONE TIME WE HAD. NEARLY TWO THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS -- WHO'D LOST. A WATER SUPPLIES FROM THEIR MUNICIPAL FROM BOTH MUNICIPAL AND PRIVATE WELLS -- WE ALSO IN THIS TIME EXPERIENCE THE NAPA EARTHQUAKE THAT REFUGIO OIL SPILL A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE ACTIVITY ACROSS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES. ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST WE HELP TO OVERSEE THE RESPONSE -- WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY TO THE EARLY CO CANYON NATURAL GAS LEAK. THE SAMBAR TO DENOTE TERRORIST INCIDENT WAS SOMETHING THAT CHIEF PAYS AND THEN OUR HOMELAND SECURITY -- BRANCH WITH IN OUR RESPONSE AND RECOVERY DIRECTOR IT WAS. DEEPLY INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THE RESPONSE. TO WE'VE ALSO EXPERIENCE NEARLY A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION TREES LOST AS A RESULT OF THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS AS PART OF THE TREE MORTALITY PROGRAM. THAT WE SUPPORT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CAL FIRE. WE'VE ALSO BEEN DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- SOME RECOGNIZED FOR THE PUBLIC SOME NOT THIS INCLUDES THAT HAPPENS APPETITE IS C. OUTBREAK. ZECA VIRUS -- AND A BULLET THREAT AND WE'RE STILL CURRENTLY DEALING WITH ANY BREAK IN POULTRY FLOCKS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE FLOODS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE WERE TREMENDOUS WITH FIFTY FOUR OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IMPACTED DURING THAT EVENT. THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FLOOD EMERGENCIES ALSO SAW -- THE EMERGENCY AT THE ORVILLE WHICH RESULTED IN THE LARGEST NON HURRICANE EVACUATION IN US HISTORY. WE WE WENT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN INTO TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ON JANUARY NINTH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN EXPERIENCED THE DEVASTATING MONOSYLLABIC SLIDES IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN MANY OF THE THE STATE'S LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES OR EXPERIENCE WE HAD TEN OF THE TOP TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SIX OF THE TOP TWENTY LARGEST FIRES. AND OF COURSE THE DEADLIEST BEING THE CAMPFIRE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER HELLO YES HEADQUARTERS WHERE WE IT THAT IS THE HUB OF COORDINATION OF ALL STATE AGENCIES. RESPONSE IN SUPPORT OF COMMUNITIES IMPACTED BY DISASTER. THAT FACILITY WAS ACTIVATED A HUNDRED AND ONE DAYS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN DAYS AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN TOTAL ACROSS TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNOR PROCLAIM SIXTEEN EMERGENCIES. WE REQUESTED AND RECEIVED THREE PRESIDENTIAL MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ALSO REQUESTED AND RECEIVED TWELVE FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS IN THESE -- SIGNIFICANT IN THAT THE FIRE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FUNDING. SO THAT WE CAN AVOID IT MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATIONS AROSE AS A RESULT OF FIRES. AND SO TWELVE OF THOSE FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANTS WERE AWARDED IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WAS SAID EARLIER SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIRES ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FIRES HIT SISKIYOU COUNTY IN A NUMBER OF YEARS. WAS THE KLAMATH FUND WE SAW THE WEST FIRE DOWN NEAR THE CALIFORNIA BORDER IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY OF GREAT SIGNIFICANCE THE HOLIDAY FIRE AND SANTA BARBARA. THE CAR FIRE THAT STRETCH FROM SHASTA IN -- FROM TRINITY TO SHASTA COUNTIES WE EXPERIENCE THREE CATEGORIZED CATEGORY THREE TORNADO AND FORTY THREE MILE AN HOUR WINDS. SOMETHING THAT THE TRULY WAS UNPRECEDENTED FIND CALIFORNIA FIRE HISTORY -- WE EXPERIENCE THE CRANSTON FIRED RIVERSIDE THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRE. CONSUMED -- ACREAGE ACROSS FOUR COUNTIES IN COLUSA GLENN LAKE IN MENDOCINO COUNTY. AT THE TIME WAS THE LARGEST FIRE -- IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY FOR A FROM A GROUP OF THE YEAR A NOVEMBER EIGHTH -- AND INTO NOVEMBER WE EXPERIENCE THE CAMPFIRE THE DEADLIEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY AS WELL AS THE WALLS THE FIRE AND HELL FIRES AND VENTURE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. LAST YEAR'S FIRES RESULTED IN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX LIVES LOST MORE THAN ONE MILLION ACRES BURNED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND STRUCTURES BOTH HOMES AND BUSINESSES JUST DESTROYED. TO COMBAT THESE DEVASTATING FIRES -- CALLOW YES ENACTED. UP THE PRE POSITIONING OF RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS PRE POSITIONING OF FIRE AND RESCUE RESOURCES PROVIDES QUICK REACTION TIME TO STATE INCIDENTS WHILE REASSURING COMMUNITIES THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDS READY TO SUPPORT. THOSE RESOURCES ARE PRE POSITIONED READY AND AVAILABLE TO COMBAT THE THREAT. IN ITS IMMEDIATE START. IN HOPES THAT IT DOES NOT REACHED CATASTROPHIC LEVELS AND THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALLOW YES RECEIVED EIGHTY SIX PRE POSITIONING REQUEST AND ALL THOSE REQUESTS WERE FILLED. AND IN MANY CASES THOSE PRE POSITIONED RESOURCES WERE UTILIZED AS INITIAL ATTACK TO MINIMIZE THE FURTHER IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- THROUGH THAT PRE POSITIONING WE SAW ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED FIREFIGHTERS FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES PLACED IN STRATEGIC LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE RESPONSE TIMES. FIRE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN RESPONSE WERE STRETCHED TO THE LIMITS. SO IN ADDITION TO DOING THE PRE POSITIONING CHIEF MARSHALL AND HIS TEAM RESPONSIBLE -- FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THE FIRES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BEING SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE EXHAUSTED OUR AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND MANY SITUATE AND MANY CASES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALLAWAY AS COORDINATED ALMOST THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND RESOURCES THROUGH OUR FIRE AND RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. ON THE JULY FIRES ALONE -- THE CAR AND MENDOCINO COMPLEXES FROM OUT OF STATE. FOR THE NOVEMBER WILD FIRES THE CAMP HILL AND WALLS A THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ENGINES WERE BROUGHT IN. THIS REFLECTS THE MOST SEVERE THREAT POSED TO FIRES. IN THESE HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS SUCH AS PARADISE IN MALIBU. THE SHEER MAGNITUDE OF THE CAT CATASTROPHIC NOVEMBER WILDFIRES OVERWHELMED OUR ABILITY TO MEET THE STATE'S NEED FOR ENGINES WATER TENDERS AND OVERHEAD PERSONNEL. WE WERE UNABLE TO FILL THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE REQUESTS WE RECEIVED FOR THE CAMP HILL AND WALLS THE FIRES. THAT AMOUNTED 261% OF ALL OF OUR UNFILLED REQUESTS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM OVERSEEN BY CHIEF PAYS AN AND IS LAW ENFORCEMENT BRANCH. WAS EXTREMELY BUSY OVER THE COURSE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR THE CAMP FIRE OFFICERS AND VOLUNTEERS CAME FROM FIFTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES SIX DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES INCLUDING -- YES C. H. P.

THE RESPONSE RECOVERY FUNCTIONS THAT ABOUT ESTABLISH A FEDERAL LEVEL THIS FRAMEWORK -- BILLS ON THE STATE'S EXPERIENCE AND RECOVERY DOCUMENTS AND GUIDANCE.

HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY TURNED BACK OVER TO GRACE TO TALK A LITTLE GREATER DETAIL ABOUT OUR RECOVERY REIMBURSEMENT. PROGRAMS UNLESS THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS NO I THINK HELEN M. KIND OF OUTLINE THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT AND THAT WAS THE THE FUNDING MECHANISM. BY WHICH WE SUPPORT THE LOCALS -- DUE TO THE OVERWHELMING NATURE OF IT NOT ONLY FUNDS -- IT WE CAN FIND THE CITIES THIS. THE COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS -- TO ADDRESS THEIR EMERGENCY DISASTER RESPONSE FOR STEAK PROCLAIMED EMERGENCIES THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF PUBLIC PROPERTY DAMAGED OR DESTROYED BY THE EMERGENCY. AND WE CAN ALSO -- PROVIDE THE SOME OF THE MATCHING FUND THAT HELEN SPOKE TO FOR COST SHARING REQUIRED -- FOR EXAMPLE IF IT'S A SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE DISASTER WE CAN FIND A PORTION OF THE LOCAL CARSHARE THROUGH THIS MECHANISM -- IN GENERAL ED TYPICALLY THE SHARE IS NO MORE THAN 75% OF THOSE ELIGIBLE COSTS. SO THE ELIGIBLE COSTS INCLUDE OVER TIME AND THE OVERTIME ASSOCIATED WAGE FOR ADDED COST FOR THE RESPONSE NOT TYPICALLY YOUR NORMAL BASE SALARY ACTUAL TRAVEL AND PER DIEM SUPPLIES MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT. REPAIR PERMANENT RESTORATION A REPLACEMENT COSTS COSTS FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES. THE COST OF BASIC ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR WHICH THOSE ARE NECESSARY FOR AND ADMINISTRATIVE COST AND COST FOR WORK PERFORMED UNDER INTER AGENCY ASSISTANCE -- IT WHETHER IT'S THROUGH ANOTHER STATE AGENCY OR A UNIVERSITY. AND THE LOCAL CULTURE IS REQUIRED UNDER THE FEDERAL FEDERAL PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. AND UNDER THAT -- THE STATE IF THE TWENTY FIVE IF IT IS FEDERALLY COST SHARED. THE STATE WOULD FURTHER CARSHARE WITH THE LOCALS SO THAT 25% WOULD BE -- EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN AND A POINT SEVEN FIVE FOR THE STATE AND SIX AND A QUARTER FOR THE LOCALS. SEWED SO EVERYONE HAS A STAKE IN THE IN THE CONTROLLING AND MANAGING OF THOSE COST SO [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] ALL CONTINUE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WEBER AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE VIA BOARD MY NAME IS HOLLY PORTER I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND I'M ENTERING MY EIGHTH YEAR IN THIS ROLE AND MY AIM TODAY IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PERSPECTIVE. HOW WE WORK WITH CARILLO YES AND GAPS THAT I SEE FROM A MORE GRANULAR AT THE GROUND LEVEL? SO WHAT'S AN EMERGENCY MANAGER WELL YOU COULD SAY THAT I AM A PAID PESSIMIST. I AM A PAID TO THINK ALL DAY ABOUT WORST CASE SCENARIOS AND HOW WE CAN WORK TO MAKE DISASTERS LESS IMPACTFUL WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN. UNFORTUNATELY OUR STATE IS SEEN SEVERAL HISTORICALLY DEVASTATING DISASTERS IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHICH HAS A FIRM TO THE NEED FOR A STRONG AND ROBUST STATE AND LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY. IN A REAL SENSE SUCCESSFUL EMERGENCY MANAGERS ARE LIKE CONDUCTORS. WE KEEP THE ORCHESTRA OF PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL AND SANK BY MEDIATING. FACILITATING AND COMMUNICATING NGUYEN FIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT MEDICAL SERVICES PUBLIC WORKS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. SO I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU A REAL WORLD SCENARIO TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT EMERGENCY MANAGERS DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WHY THEY'RE SO CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY EFFORT. LET'S SAY THERE'S A FAST MOVING FIRE THAT BREAKS OUT IN A FICTIONAL TOWN THAT WILL CALL ME VERY. CALIFORNIA. LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THE FIRST TO ARRIVE ON SCENE SHE GOES DOOR TO DOOR URGING RESIDENTS TO EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY TO A TEMPORARY EVACUATION POINT. AT THE LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL NEAR BY. THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICER GETS THIS INFORMATION FROM DISPATCHING TWEETS OUT FIRE IN MAYBERRY EVACUATIONS IN PROGRESS TEMPORARY EVACUATION POINT IS MAYBERRY UNION HIGH SCHOOL. WHILE THE OFFICERS WORKING DILIGENTLY TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF HARM'S WAY FIRE PERSONNEL ARRIVE ON SCENE ESTABLISH UNIFIED COMMAND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND BEGIN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL EVACUATIONS AND FIRE RESOURCES. FIRE PERSONNEL NOTIFY THE MAYBERRY COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ABOUT THE FAST MOVING FIRE AND THEY REQUESTED EMERGENCY MANAGER FIELD LIAISON AT THEIR COMMAND POST. THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR MAYBERRY IMMEDIATELY DISPATCH AS A STAFF MEMBER TO THE LOCATION WHERE THAT COMMAND STAFF IS GATHERED FIRE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT EMERGENCY MANAGER BEGINS COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTY'S EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER. EMERGENCY MANAGERS AT THAT EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER ARE CONTACTING THE AMERICAN RED CA RED CROSS. THEY'RE REQUESTING CANTEEN SERVICES IT'S THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THEIR INFORMING THE RED CROSS THAT AN OVERNIGHT SHELTER MAY BE NEEDED. MAYBERRY COUNTY EMERGENCY MANAGERS CALL THE HIGH SCHOOL JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THE OF THOSE INCOMING GAS. LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGERS ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF MAJOR HIGHWAYS MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE FIRE OR IN THE CASE OF MAYBERRY IT COULD BE THE ONLY ROAD IN AND OUT OF THAT COMMUNITY. MIGHT THERE BE A NEED FOR A LARGE ANIMAL EVACUATIONS IF SO A CALL FOR ASSISTANCE MAY BE NEEDED TO COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES. SO THE FIRST PRIORITY IS MOBILIZING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES. EMERGENCY MANAGERS ARE STAFFING UP THE PUBLIC INFORMATION CALL CENTER THEY'RE COORDINATING FOR MASS CARE AND FEEDING ALERTING COUNTY DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TEAMS AND PUTTING COUNTY STAFF ON CALL OR ON STAND BY FOR TO SET UP A LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTER. MARY EMERGENCY MANAGERS ARE ALSO CONTACTING THE TERRITORIAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR CALLOW YES AND THEIR NOTIFYING THE STATE WARNING CENTER. EMERGENCY MANAGERS IN MAYBERRY ARE ASSISTING WITH BOTH UNINCORPORATED AREA PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING CALLS AND HELPING CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY INITIATE MASS NOTIFICATION MESSAGES WHEN ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICERS ARE CALLED TO WORK AT THE MAY VERY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO ASSIST WITH SOCIAL MEDIA PRESS CONFERENCES MEDIA CALLS AND WEBSITE UPDATES. THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS UPDATING THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVES. ALL OF THIS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU IS HAPPENING WITH WITHIN JUST THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF THAT FIRE BREAKING OUT. SO WHAT I'VE DESCRIBED HERE SOME OF THE ACTION CENTRAL TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. MOBILIZING EMERGENCY PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES PUBLIC ALERT AND WARNING MASS CARE AND FEEDING WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION COORDINATING MESSAGING AMONG VARIOUS AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE DISASTER RESPONSE. WERE INVOLVED IN THE COORDINATION OF LIFELINE RESTORATION LIKE WATER POWER POWER FUEL NATURAL GAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS. AND THEN THERE'S THE LONG JOURNEY OF DISASTER RECOVERY FROM DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO DEBRIS REMOVAL TO LONG AND SHORT SHORT TERM HOUSING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF CULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. IN SHORT IT'S A BIG JOB SO IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALL OF THOSE CRITICAL AND IMMEDIATE ACTIONS ARE EXPECTED OF AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFF OF ONE OR TO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS IN MANY CITIES. AND COUNTIES HERE IN OUR STATE. MEANWHILE DISASTERS OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS ARE OCCURRING REGULARLY. THERE'S A WELL KNOWN SAYING IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT ARE ALL DISASTERS ARE LOCAL. WELL THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY REMAIN LOCAL DEPENDS UPON THE INVESTMENT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT. NECESSARY TO PREPARE FOR RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM DISASTERS. I'M INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO WORK FOR HAS INVESTED HEAVILY IN THESE CAPABILITIES. I HAVE FIFTEEN NON ADMINISTRATIVE EMERGENCY MANAGERS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH ACCOMPLISHING ALL THE ACTIONS I'VE DESCRIBED TODAY BUT THIS IS NOT COMMON. ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CALIFORNIA. TYPICALLY AND SOME MID SIZED AND AND SMALLER CITIES AND EVEN SOME COUNTY'S. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HAS FEW IF ANY STAFF RESOURCES. HOWEVER THEY'RE VERY ROLE REQUIRES INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION WITH MANY CITY AND COUNTY DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AND SOME LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE EMERGENCY MANAGERS ONE POSITION THAT'S BURIED IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND OF EITHER FIRE OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOME JURISDICTIONS A SIGN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AS OTHER DUTIES AS ASSIGNED TO AN ANALYST OR SOMEONE EVEN IN PUBLIC WORKS. EFFECTIVE EMERGENCY MANAGERS MUST DISPLAY SPECIALIZED JOB KNOWLEDGE AWARENESS OF CURRENT PENDING LEGISLATION. FAMILIARITY WITH REGULATIONS EXPERIENCE WITH PLANNING TRAINING AND DRILLS AND A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF FEDERAL TRIBAL STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ALL ASSOCIATED WITH EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. IN THE ABSENCE OF A FULLY CAPABLE WELL RESOURCE LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY THE STATE MUST. BACK FILL. MOBILIZING PEOPLE AND RESOURCES TAKES TIME AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE WHEN IT COMES TO DISASTER RESPONSE. FOR SAN DIEGO COUNTY THE STATE IS A SAFETY NET WHEN LOCAL RESOURCES ARE EXHAUSTED AND STATE OR FEDERAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED. ANYTIME WE ACTIVATE OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WE HAVE A CALLOW YES REPRESENTATIVE SITTING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER WITH US. THIS FACILITATES COMMUNICATION TO THE STATE'S SOUTHERN REGION EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER AND THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE INFORMED. CALLAWAY YES STAFF OR THERE DURING THE TO ASSIST US IN GETTING THE NECESSARY PERSONNEL EQUIPMENT AND RESOURCES THAT WE CAN'T FIND WITHIN OUR OWN COUNTY. WHEN IT COMES TO RESPONSE THE STATE'S POSTURE UNDER DIRECTOR GIL DO CHEESE LEADERSHIP IS PROACTIVE AND FORWARD LEANING? THEY DEPLOY EARLY AND RETREAT LATER IF THE SITUATION WARRANTS WE'VE APPRECIATED THE RESPONSIVENESS AND AVAILABILITY OF CALLOW YES DURING SOME OF THE TOUGHEST DAYS OUR COMMUNITY IS FACED. FOLLOWING THE LILAC FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN THE STATE EMBEDDED STAFF FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME IN OUR RECOVERY OPERATIONS CENTER. NAVIGATING THE MYRIAD OF ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND APPLICATION PROCESSES FOR STATE AND FEDERAL PUBLIC AN INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS CAN BE VERY DAUNTING. MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RELY UPON CALLOW YES FOR THEIR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE IN THESE PROGRAMS AND AND DISASTER RECOVERY IN GENERAL. MY OFFICE IS IN DAILY CONTACT WITH SOMEONE FROM CALLOW YES WE MIGHT BE IN CONTACT REGARDING HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT INVESTMENTS. HAZARD MITIGATION PLANNING OR DISASTER PLANNING FOR PEOPLE WITH ACCESS AND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS HELLO YES MAYBE CONSULTING WITH US AS THEY WRITE NEW STATEWIDE GUIDANCE ON ANY NUMBER OF TOPICS WE TALK WITH EACH OTHER IN ADVANCE OF DURING AND AFTER A MAJOR WEATHER EVENTS. SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE DAILY WITH CALLOW YES STAFF AND CONSIDER THEM PART OF OUR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT TEAM. RECENTLY CALLOW YES LAUNCHED AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CREDENTIALING PROGRAM THIS PROVIDES A BENCHMARK DEFINING THE STANDARDS AND EXPERIENCE NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED A QUALIFIED EMERGENCY MANAGER. BY SETTING STANDARDS CALLOW YES IS TAKING THE LEAD AND PROFESSIONAL ISING ARE DISCIPLINE. BUT THE GAPS I SEE YOU'RE RELATED TO SHEER NUMBERS. NO ONE QUESTIONS THE NEED FOR BIG RED OR BIG BLUE. THE PURPOSE AND MISSION OF FIRE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IS WELL KNOWN AND WIDELY UNDERSTOOD. HOWEVER FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER HURRICANE KATRINA THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION STILL STRUGGLES TO GET BIG ENOUGH FAST ENOUGH TO ACCOMPLISH THE MISSION AT HAND. AND THE MISSION OF COURSE IS ABOUT SAVING LIVES IN PROTECTING PROPERTY. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN I SAY. I WORK IN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AND THE PERSON WHO'S CUTTING MY HAIR DOESN'T RESPOND BACK -- SO YOU DRIVE AN AMBULANCE. IN THIS CONTEXT I WILL TAKE OFF MY PESSIMIST HAT AND SAY. I BELIEVE WE'LL GET THERE. I JUST PRAY IT DOESN'T TAKE SEVERAL MORE DEVASTATING DISASTERS TO PROVE THAT ROBUST EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT STAFFING AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN THIS INCREASINGLY COMPLEX THREAT ENVIRONMENT THAT WE LIVE IN. CHARMING THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS PENDING ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM COMMITTEE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. PANELISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ATTENDING TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM RAIMENT RIORDAN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EXCEPT THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THE CITY OF SAN JOSE. BEFORE STARTING AT SAN JOSE. I'M MIGHT LOOK TWENTY FIVE BUT I HAVE THIRTY ONE YEARS EXPERIENCE AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AT THE LOCAL THE COUNTY THE STATE. AND FEDERAL RESPONSE LEVELS INCLUDING WORK WITH A SPECIAL DISTRICTS. IN ADDITION I'M CURRENTLY THE STATE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ASSOCIATION. THAT REPRESENTS OVER THREE SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MEMBERS. WHO ARE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MANAGERS AND CITIES COUNTIES PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICAL HEALTH AND PRIVATE SECTORS WHILE? ONE OF SEIZE US THAT'S THE ACRONYM FOR THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ASSOCIATION OUR MISSION IS TO WORK WITH CALORIE US TO SUPPORT. PLANNING TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FIELD. I'M HERE TO DATE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE CONDITION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. AT THE LOCAL CITY LEVEL. ANY RELATIONSHIP TO OUR VOTE RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OR CALORIE US. THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CALLAWAY THIS IS GOOD. AND LIKE ALL RELATIONSHIPS THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH LOCAL LONG FIRE THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IS TREMENDOUS AS RESULTS BUT AS DIRECTOR LIBERAL INDICATED THAT. MEDICINE PORT RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO DISASTERS. CALLAWAY US IN THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY. ARE BOTH AGREE AND TEACHER THEIR COURSES THAT DISASTERS ARE LOCAL. LOCAL POLICE FIRE AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ARE THE FIRST TO RESPOND. THE FIRST TO TAKE ACTION. THE FIRST TO MAKE DECISIONS ON A LEARNING AND WARNING. IT IS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAS TO MANAGE THE RECOVERY FOLLOWING THE DISASTER. WE THE FIRST TO WHOM THE PUBLIC LOOKS EXPECTED FERMENTATION DECISIONS AND COMMUNITY FOCUS LEADERSHIP. WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE A VISION OF COMPASSION IN ACTION. WHILE MEETING THE PUBLIC'S BASIC NEEDS. WHILE DISASTROUS TRULY OUR LOCAL WE ALWAYS LOOK TO CALORIE AS FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND GAUGE BENT. BEFORE DURING AND AFTER AN EMERGENCY. SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AGAIN DIRECT LINE ROAD DID INDICATE THE INCREASED NUMBER OF DISASTERS THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING. AND BY DEFINITION DISASTER CONDITIONS EXCEED. THE NORMAL CAPABILITIES OF LOCAL POLICE FIRE MEDICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH. REQUIRES RESPONSE AND PROFESSIONALISM OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. WHO PLAN TRAINED AND ORGANIZE RESOURCES AND FACILITIES? IN RESPONSE TO THE CATASTROPHIC INCIDENCES LIKE THE CURRENT FLOODS. THE LAST TWO YEARS OF FIRES IN BUTTE SO NO MY NAPA COUNTIES. AND FOR OUR OVERDUE FUTURE CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA YES WE ARE PESSIMISTS. EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONALS ARE THE ONES WHO DEVELOP THOSE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE VISION OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ELECTED OFFICIALS. EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSE OFFICIALS. IT IS THE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONAL. WHO PREPARES THOSE PLANTS PROCEDURES IN THE WARNING SYSTEMS? IS A LOCAL EMERGENCY MANAGER HER LEARN. AND PLANS AND EXECUTES HIS OBLIGATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH CALORIE YES. AS CALLOW YES IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR MANY THINGS OF WE DISCUSSED TODAY INCLUDING THE COORDINATION OF MUTUAL AID. THE PROCLAMATION EMERGENCY PROCESS. POST DISASTER FUNDS FROM FEMA AND PRE DISASTER FUNDING STREAMS. THE FUNDING STREAMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THROUGH CALORIE US TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ARE INSUFFICIENT. THEY RELY A LOT ON FEDERAL BUDGET APPROVALS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT OP PROCESS SEES. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS STE CHALLENGE THEM TO SUSTAIN AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WITHIN THESE LIMITED FUNDS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT FOR PERFECT POSITIONS. HAVE BEEN EITHER ELIMINATED DUE TO BUDGET CUTS IN THE RECESSION. OR THERE MINIMIZED AND BECAUSE A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE FOCUS AND PURPOSE OF WHAT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CAN'T PROVIDE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. AS RESULT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT POSITIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED OR CONTINUE BE UNDER FUNDED. BASIC PLANS EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER PROPONENTS ARE FREQUENTLY OUT OF DATE AS A RESULT. IN MANY CASES THE ROLE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. HAS BEEN DELEGATED TO LAW OR FIRE STAFF. AS AN ADDITIONAL DUTY ON TOP ALL THOSE OTHER PRIMARY LIFE SAFETY TASKS. THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE DO NOT MAKE IT SOMETIMES TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN MANY CASES THE FUNDING STREAMS STOP AT THE OPERATIONAL AREA WHICH IS THE JURISDICTION BOUNDARIES OF THE COUNTY. AN REPRESENTATIVES OF MEMBERS UP WITHIN THAT AREA -- BUT DON'T MAKE IT TO ACTUALLY LOCAL THE CITY GOVERNMENT. FOR EXAMPLE IS SANTA CLARA COUNTY THE STATE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PERFORMANCE GRANTS. DO NOT CORRECT DIRECTLY GO TO CITY PROGRAMS. THEY'RE DIVIDED AMONG OTHER PROGRAMS BY THE OP AREA. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN THE STANDARDIZED EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT'S REGULATIONS WERE PUBLISHED. SAM'S BECAME THE GUIDING BEACON FOR PLANTS TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION. I WAS PROUD TO SIT ON THE GOVERNOR'S ADVISORY BOARD THAT HELPED CREATE THE PROGRAM. I IT WAS NEW AND INNOVATIVE. IT WAS SO EFFECTIVE THAT AFTER NINE ELEVEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CLEAN THE CONCEPTS AND PROGRAMS OF SAM'S. TO CREATE THE NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO WHICH WE ALSO REQUIRED TO FOLLOW. SAM'S IS CRITICAL IT'S CRITICAL FOR OUR EXPECTS BUT IT MUTUAL AID STANDARDIZING RESPONSE. BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT LEVELS. AN ACCREDITING A CREDENTIALING IS PRODUCT. THE SUMS PROTOCOLS HOWEVER HAVE BECOME OUTDATED AND NEED TO REBOOT. LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO WORK WITH CARILLO YES TO UPDATE AND REFRESH THE SAM SYSTEM. BECAUSE SO MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT DISASTER RESPONSE RECOVERY OVER THESE TWENTY THREE YEARS. TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF HEALTH SERVICES CAN BE A CHALLENGE. SPECIFICALLY TO SAN JOSE. IF YOU STRICTLY INTERPRET THE SAM'S REGULATIONS CALORIE US PERSONNEL. CANNOT DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE WITH SAN JOSE THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE COUNTY FOR INFORMATION. CONDITIONS FOR DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN CALAVERAS AND THE CITY. CAN MAKE SENSE AND NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. RECOVERY FROM A DISASTROUS DIFFICULT. IT TAKES FREQUENT TWISTS AND TURNS AND LEAVES GAPS IN FULL RECOVERY. HELLO YES. IS EXPERIENCING THE GRAYSON ARMY RETIREMENTS THE EXPERIENCE OF SO MANY. AND SO MANY NEW STAFF FOR COMING ON COLLEGE BASIS LEAVING AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS AS WELL. TRAINING IN UNDERSTANDING THE RECOVERY PATH IS CRITICAL FOR BOTH STATE AND LOCAL PERSONNEL. DURING OUR INITIAL RECOVERY FROM THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COUNTY CREEK FLOOD. WE HAD NO LESS THAN FIVE CALLOW YES. PRIMARY CONTACTS REPLACE EACH OTHER. EACH HAVE THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION OF WHAT WAS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A CLAIM. WHICH MADE THE TASK OF INITIATING RECOVERY VERY DIFFICULT. WITH THE FREQUENCY DISASTERS INCREASING. RECOVERY HOUSE TO BECOME SECOND NATURE. HELLO YES NEEDS TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT DEVELOPING A MORE CLEANLY DEFINED RECOVERY PROTOCOLS SYSTEM. RECOVERY IS NOT EVEN PART OF THE SAMS PROCESS. ANOTHER REASON FOR THE INTEGRATION UPDATE OF SAM'S. UNDERSTANDING HOW CALORIE US THE TERMS THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL PROCLAMATION OF EMERGENCY. NEEDS TO BE REFRESHED IN JUST THE AND DISCUSSED AMONGST THE AGENCIES. HISTORICALLY UNTIL TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT WAS ROUTINE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE ACT. GRANT. PRIOR TO DISASTER SINCE THEN THE HASN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN EVERY YEAR IT TYPICALLY FUNDED AFTER A DISASTER. BOB THIS ALSO THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY THE TIGHTS EMERGENCIES WE SAW DECLARED BEFORE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE'RE NO LONGER DECLARE EMERGENCIES EVEN THOUGH IT HAD SO MANY. OTHERS NOT DECLARED AS OFTEN. ARE THE IMPACTS THE UP THE FACT THAT THIS WORK RIVERS AS WE SEE TODAY. ARE SIGNIFICANT AND LANDING TO A VISION OF FUTURE FREQUENT THAT DECORATIONS THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. BY IN THE DECLARATION OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHAT THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE THE SAN JOSE IS THAT INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE WAS NOT PART OF THE DECORATION. BUT IT WAS SORELY NEEDED BY OUR PUBLIC WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE WITH THE DONATIONS OF OVER SIX POINT FOUR MILLION. THAT WE AS A CITY DEVELOPED OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AT THAT TIME TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLIC. WELL THESE ARE AREAS OF CONCERN WE DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE CARILLO YES IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THE BACK FILL THE STATE PROPERTIES LOST -- AT THE PROP THE TO ME THE STATE PROPERTY TAXES I COLLECTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AFFECTED BY THESE RECENT WILDFIRES THAT WAS A GREAT MOVE. TECHNOLOGY ALSO NEEDS TO BE ADVANCED IN THE FEEL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT. THE CURRENT STATEWIDE DATE IN SITUATIONS STATUS REPORTING SYSTEM MAINTAINED BY CALORIE US. IS WOEFULLY OUTPACED BY OTHER AVAILABLE SYSTEMS. THE ATTEMPT TO CREATING A COMMON OPERATING PICTURE IS CRITICAL AND NECESSARY DURING RESPONSE. UNTIL RECENTLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM KNOWN AS CAL E. LIKE CAL D. O. C. TYPING AT THE RIGHT. ARM HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- USE OR INTEGRATION -- IF A DISASTER IS LOCAL IN THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EMERGENCY IS LOCAL. DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL UP. TO THE STATE. AN INTEGRATED THE CONCEPTS AND ISSUES THAT WE BOTH HAVE IN RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. IN CONCLUSION. WHAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE INVESTMENTS AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WHAT ARE THEY AND WHAT DO THEY MEAN? ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE A BILLING SCIENCE FOR EVERYONE DOLLAR INVESTED PREPAREDNESS MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. SIX DOLLARS AN RECOVERY COSTS ARE SAVED. IT IS BETTER TO FOCUS ON PLANNING TRAINING MITIGATING A CONCERT WITH EACH OTHER. THAT SPENT ALL OUR RESOURCES TRYING TO RECOVER FROM THE LAST DISASTER. WE NEED A ROBUST INSIST STATE INVESTMENT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT READY NESS AND RESILIENCE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME RECENTLY COMMENTED THAT THERE WAS A NEW NORMAL IN THE GLOBAL DISASTER AFFECTING CALIFORNIA. HE FURTHER NOTED THAT THE HOT SEASON IT'S HOTTER. THE WET SEASON IS WATER. HIS BUDGET CALLS FOR GREAT DEVELOPS FOR TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH THINGS THE NEW WARNING SYSTEM THE EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM WHICH IS NEEDED. NOT ALL THESE PROGRAMS MAY NOT ALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE NOT REACH DOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE'RE HERE TO ASK THE DIALOGUE ON THESE ISSUES THAT I REYES AND OTHERS. CAN BE COVERED THOUGHT I COULD COME OF ALL THIS TIME FOR A BILL THAT WE CAN. OPEN THESE DIALOGUES. BOB WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT VOMIT TO CONTINUE THE GOOD RELATIONSHIP WE HAVE CAL WITH CALORIE US. AND ALLOW US TO BE OPEN HONEST AND DIRECT AND HOW WE CAN MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TOGETHER. LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS ASKING FOR SEAT AT THE TABLE AN ENGAGEMENT OF THESE EFFORTS. I THANK YOU -- DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS THE SYSTEM. A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- YOU MENTIONED THAT SOME OF YOU HAVE -- PERSONS WHO IS IN CHARGE OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND THAT'S SPECIFICALLY THAT JOB. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY COUNTIES HAVE THAT. WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON SO EVERY CALIFORNIA COUNTY HAS AN OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES RIGHT AS HOLLY A VERY ELOQUENTLY -- ILLUSTRATED. IT RUNS THE GAMUT FROM THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT HAS I THINK OVER A DOZEN STAFF TO A MODOC COUNTY THAT HAS. AN INDIVIDUAL DOING IT ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER DUTIES WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. SO -- IN THE YES OFFICES ARE ORGANIZED A DIFF -- I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT ACROSS THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- MOST OF THEM -- WOULD PROBABLY TWO THIRDS OF THEM ARE AT IN IN EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FIRE. BUT THE REST ARE ORGANIZED IN CA OWES OFFICE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES -- PUBLIC WORKS OFFICES -- AND THE COMMITMENT THAT THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE TO EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT COUNTY TO COUNTY AND A LOT OF THAT IS DRIVEN BY. THEIR EXPERIENCES THOSE JURISDICTIONS SIMILAR TO SAN DIEGO THAT HAVE -- OVER THE LAST DECADE PLUS EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. HAVE HAVE. I HAVE COMMITTED -- EIGHT EIGHT TWO THEIR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM -- BUT A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS I THINK IT CONTINUES TO BE AN EDUCATION FOLKS ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT -- OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE AND EMS PERSONNEL DO VERY HEROICALLY. AND THE COMMITMENT OF OF RESOURCES -- IS IS PROVIDED THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME -- BECAUSE OF THAT AGAINST AMBIGUOUS NATURE MANAGEMENT -- SO THERE'S NOT NOT THE SAME LEVEL OF COMMITMENT. WHAT IMPACT OR HAVE WE HAD A CHANCE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND HELPING? WITH THIS HAVE THEY BEEN VERY HELPFUL HAVE THE IMPEDED PROGRESS AND WHAT IT WHAT IS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM -- WE JUST WERE RECENTLY MADE AWARE OF SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT -- IS BEING PROPOSED AND WE'RE SAYING AS FAR AS OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENT IT IS -- THE SAME OR IN SOME CASES A LITTLE HIGHER. SO I THINK THAT THEIR COMMITMENT DEALING AT THIS AS ON A NATIONAL BASIS WITH SO MANY STATES BEING HIT. OTHER IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ADDITIONALLY THE ENACTMENT OF WHAT ERIC VIEWED AS A LONG TERM RECOVERY -- WE HAD. FOR A DISASTER. RECOVERY FRAMEWORK -- THAT. ALLOWS FOR THE MISSION TASKING A FEDERAL ENTITY SUCH AS HUD COME SIT WITH THE STATE AND THE LOCALS TO TO ADDRESS COMPLEX ISSUES. OF THE FEDERAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES -- PERSONNEL TO COME WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH TO WORK OUT HOSPITALS AND OUR OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUES. SO I THINK THE COMMITMENT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT GOVERNMENT I THINK THE COMMITMENT IS THERE. AN EIGHT BUT I THINK AS WITH EVERYTHING THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THE DOCUMENTATION THE CERTIFICATION THE QUALIFICATIONS ALL VERY -- VERY IMPORTANT AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. THERE. ARE WE AT YOUR RECOMMENDATION -- YOUR COM THINGS SHOULD HAPPEN SHOULD MOVE UP FROM THE LOCAL TO THE STATE LEVEL IN TERMS OF PLANNING -- DO WE HAVE THAT IN PLACE IN TERMS OF A ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE PLANNING AND THE RESOURCE DISTRIBUTE DISTRIBUTION AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. DO YOU WANNA STARTED YOU WANT US TO TALK ABOUT WILL GO AHEAD AND START. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE SAM'S PROCESS REALLY CLEARLY IDENTIFIES FIVE LEVELS OF RESPONSE IN COORDINATION. AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THERE IS A LOT OF FREE STUFF OF DEMAND IN ELEMENTS PUT ON US. I ENDED BE KEY RIGHT NOW WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WAS THE CAL THE CAL E. O. C. OR WEB EOC PLATFORM. INFORMATION HOW IT SHARES FROM THE FEEL ALL THE WAY UP THE HELLO YES LEVEL. WELL THE SYSTEM THAT'S AVAILABLE STOPS FOR OUR JURISDICTIONS STOPPED AT THE COUNTY. THE LOCAL LEVEL DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT SYSTEM. IT UNTIL THE LAST YEAR SO WE ARE WORKING ON DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS BUT IT'S AN OLDER SYSTEM IT DOESN'T HAVE THE TO BEGIN THAT THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN HELP. MANAGE THE DATA THE DATA STREAM THAT EXIST RIGHT NOW AND THERE ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS THAT COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN THE SHARING. OF INFORMATION FROM THE FIELD ALL THE WAY UP TO THE STATE. YEAH THEM THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT HAPPY TO LOOK AT THAT WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS CRITICAL SO WE HAVE A COUPLE OTHER TOOLS BUT I KNOW THE DIRECTOR MET WITH CEASE -- THE OTHER DAY AND I'M SURE THIS MAY HAVE COME UP BUT HE IS VERY OPEN TO LOOKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE THE SYSTEM OR SYSTEMS THAT WE USE. DO YOU SEE ANY OF IT AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT THAT'S IT CONCERNING THE GAP THAT'S THERE DO YOU SEE ANY ADDITIONAL GAPS THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF THAT -- WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OF THE OPERATIONS WELL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS BROUGHT UP AS A CREDENTIALING WHICH IS FABULOUS IT'S SOMETHING WE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN LOOKING TOWARD. AND HELPING UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN. IMPLEMENT THAT WITHIN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SUPPORT CALLOW YES IN THE CONCEPT OF MUTUAL AID. WITHIN THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEMS OF FIRE LAW THE VERY WELL ESTABLISHED. VERY SMOOTH. THERE'S A SYSTEM CALLED AM OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHICH I DID NOT GET INTO WITH THE TIME CONSTRAINT. BUT THAT DOES NEED SUPPORT DOES NEED NURTURING PRIMARILY BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE THE LOCAL LEVEL IS THIS THE LONG FIRE. IS VERY WELL INTEGRATED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND ACCEPTED AND EMBRACED AND SUPPORTED WITH EVEN REPRESENTATIVES IN THE YES OFFICE. THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T TRANSLATE RIGHT NOW TO THE ALMA COORDINATION SYSTEM AND THEY COULDN'T USE MORE NURTURING THOSE ARE OTHER AREAS THAT WE CAN THE CREDENTIALING. CAN COME INTO THE CAMERA PROCESS WE CAN SEE BECAUSE THE TIME COMES WE'RE GONNA SEND HELP HELP DOWN TO SAN DIEGO THERE TO SEND HELP US. WITH A CATASTROPHIC EVENT OCCURS. AND REALLY WANT TO KNOW. IF ALWAYS COMING I KNOW SHE CAN DO THE JOB I DON'T KNOW HER STAFF. SO WHAT IS IT THEIR STAFF DOES SO WE CAN ACCEPT THAT THAT CAPABILITY AND OUR EOC AND VICE VERSA. THEY WOULD KNOW US AND OUR RESOURCES AND OUR CAPABILITIES SO IS A METHOD IN MEANS THAT WE NEED TO EVALUATE AND LOOK AT THESE MORE EFFECTIVELY. OKAY -- IF YOU HAVE TO ASSESS I MEAN WE'VE HAD NUMBER THINGS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST YEAR PROBABLY THINGS WE NEVER EXPECTED BUT I GATHER FROM. MUCH DISCUSSION IT BECOMES A NEW NORMAL NOW -- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAS GONE WELL? IN AN IN HOUSE IN THE OPERATION AND WHAT WOULD YOU. SAY ANY OF YOU THAT WE REALLY NEED TO IMPROVE ON I KNOW WE GOT THE LOCAL COORDINATION WHAT HAVE YOU -- WELL. YOU KNOW I I THINK WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF THE OF THE PROPERTIES LOSS OF LIVES LOST MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROPERTY AND SO WE ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION. I WILL THAT WE DO. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES FRIDAY AS WELL AS WE COULD -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT ENDING FOR THE IN IN TERMS OF THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR IS TO DO BETTER. I THINK -- THE LIKE TO SAY THE COLLECTIVE RESPONSE FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT THE AND COMMUNITIES AND AMEND IMPACT I THINK IS. IS THAT A LEVEL WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE I THINK THAT STARTS WITH. A WHAT WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE HEARING CALIFORNIA IS A PARTNERSHIP AT AT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. WITH CALLAWAY US. CAL FIRE THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT. THE FEMA REGIONAL OFFICE AND THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL THE LEADERS OF THAT ORGANIZATION. OUR MEETING REGULARLY. DURING ALL PHASES OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ON ON PLANNING FUNCTIONS THERE TOGETHER -- IN OUR UNIFIED COORDINATING GROUP AND IN THE FIELD -- REPRESENTING THE ADMINISTRATION -- AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS PARTNERSHIP THERE THAT ALLOW WHEN THE UNIFIED COORDINATING GROUP IS STOOD UP AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER QUICKLY ESTABLISH THOSE STATE PRIORITIES AND JUST BE ABLE TO ADJUDICATE. THOSE COMPLEX RESOURCE REQUESTS THAT ARE COMING UP FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT PARTNERSHIP A LEADERSHIP LEVEL HAS SERVED AS WELL -- THE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK JUST BECAUSE OF THE SHEER NUMBER OF EVENTS WE'VE HAD IN THE COMPLEXITIES OF THOSE EVENTS EACH OF EACH OF THAT. THE LAST THREE EVENTS WE PAT EACH ONE HAS GROWN INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX THAN THE LAST -- WE ARE SEEING OUR STATE AGENCIES -- THAT HAVE CRITICAL ROLES TO PLAY WHETHER IT'S PROCUREMENT WHETHER IT'S MASCARA AND SHELTERING. WE HAVE SEEN THOSE STATE AGENCIES AND THEIR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMPONENT WITHIN THAT AGENCY STEP UP THEIR GAME SIGNIFICANTLY -- IN IN AREAS WHERE CALAWAY YES USED TO HAVE TO TAKE A MORE HANDS ON ROLE IN IN DIFFERENT -- FUNCTIONS DURING THE RESPONSE IN SUPPORT OF COMMUNITIES WE GOT STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE TAKING THEIR ASSIGNMENT AND RUNNING WITH IT VERY EFFECTIVELY -- OTHER AGENCIES ARE BEGINNING TO COME ALONG TOO SO WE'RE SAYING THAT THE THE TRAINING AND CAPABILITY KEEP BUILDING CAPACITY LEVEL OF STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES -- NOW I I THINK THE THE YOU KNOW ALL THAT PRACTICE REALLY HAS REFINED A LOT OF OUR OF OUR SYSTEMS BUT IT'S ALSO. YOU NOTE TO YOUR POINT MAKING SURE THAT WERE SUPPORTING THE LOCALS AND THEIR CAPABILITIES AND I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED THE CREDENTIALING PROGRAM AND BEING ABLE. TO TO OFFER THAT THOSE PROGRAMS TO YOUR STAFF AND BEING ABLE TO BE MORE -- INTEGRATED AND ASSURED SO WE CAN SHARE THOSE RESOURCES FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. I ALSO THINK THAT THE WIN AT ERIC MENTIONED THE FIRST YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS THAT FOR THE ANIMAL THE ANIMAL ISSUES DURING DISASTERS IS HUGE WHETHER IT'S LIVESTOCK OR PERSONAL PETS. IT'S A HUGE ISSUE IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF ATTENTION WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES ASSIGNED LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS SO WE'RE SEEING THE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND FORMALIZATION OF THE HAVE LONG TERM HOUSING. STILL FOR EVEN FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN A BIG BIG DEAL BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING ISSUES ALREADY SO SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH THE EXPERIENCE KNOWING THE NEEDS WORKING WITH THE LOCALS TO SOLVE LOCAL PROBLEMS. IS GOING TO HELP THE STATE AND FEDERAL OF BECOME MORE EFFECTIVE AND HAVE SOLUTIONS AND IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS MORE QUICKLY AND REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS SO THAT YOU CAN RECOVER MORE QUICKLY THAT'S THAT'S OUR DIRECTORS GOAL. IS TO HELP THESE COMMUNITIES RECOVER MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE QUOTA EFFECTIVELY. EVEN IN OUR JURISDICTION -- IN SAN JOSE AS WE'VE UPDATED OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS PLAN. WE'VE MADE -- URGENCY OPERATION PLANNED -- ENGAGING MORE SPECIFICALLY IN CREATING A NEW SECTION IN OUR SAM'S ORGANIZATION CALLED RECOVERY -- AND WE HAVE DOESN'T DESIGNATED STAFF WOULD COME AT THE START OF THE EMERGENCY. TO START MANAGING THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST. HOW ARE YOU GET REIMBURSED BUT IN THE END? IT'S THE CARE OF THOSE MOST VULNERABLE IS THE CARE OF THOSE NOT JUST TODAY AND THIS WEEK BUT NOW THEIR HOME IS GONE WHAT WE DO. THE HOUSING CRUNCH THE THE HOUSING THE INTEGRATION OF THOSE -- NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS. IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY CAN DO AS A SUPPORT MECHANISM. AND BLENDING ALL THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW WE AS A GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN'T DO IT ALL OURSELVES. WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BEST BRING IN THESE OTHER DISH FOR RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND MAKE A COMMUNITY BASED RESPONSE AND RECOVERY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING TO KEEP THE DON'T CHANGE UP. AND LOOK AT SAM'S IN OUR OWN ORGANIZATION AS A WAY OF SAYING HEY WE HAVE TO OPEN UP SAM'S IT'S IT'S TOO IT'S TOO DOGMATIC IT IT'S OLD. THIS TIME TO TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THAT MEANS TO US. THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING I I I I CAN REMEMBER AS OF BEING A PART OF ONE OF THE SAN DIEGO FIRE SOME YEARS AGO. THAT THE LOOK LIKE THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY. TO OF ORDER THE PLANE AND THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THEY HAD NOT HAD TO DO THAT BEFORE AND SO WE WE HAVE THESE PLANES THAT COULD DROP THE STUFF EVERYWHERE. AND THEY SPENT FOREVER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO WHERE WE NEED TO THE GORE NOT WE WAS VERY LATE IN THE GAME. BUT THERE WAS A BIG ISSUE ABOUT THAT AND MUCH FEAR AFTERWARDS SO THAT WAS THEN AT THAT POINT. A DISCUSSION THAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE THIS IN ADVANCE OF NOT WAIT TO THE FIRE TO FIGURE OUT WHO HAS WHO CAN SIGN THE PIECE OF PAPER RIGHT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SOME COORDINATION AND IT WAS REALLY QUITE UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED THE PLANES. TO TO TO FLY OVER THIS HUGE PLANES THAT WERE RUN BY I DON'T KNOW WITH US MARINES WHAT IS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE COULD NOT GET WHO HAD THE AUTHORITY TO SIGN. IT AND SO YOU HIT ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS WORKING A MUCH BETTER AND THAT WAS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR UNIFIED COORDINATING GROUP. THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE MILITARY AND THE NATIONAL GUARD SO THAT THOSE WHEN THEY BECOME ISSUES ARE MITIGATED IMMEDIATELY RUN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE REACH BACK THEY CAN MAKE THE PHONE CALLS. AND GET IT RESOLVED. BY TRAGEDY HAPPENED SAN DIEGO INTO -- AS PEOPLE LOOK AT THE FIRES ONLY TRYING TO GET SOME RELIEF AND NO ONE COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE ORDER THE PLANE. AND A UNFORTUNATE DOCTOR WHATEVER FIELD YOU YET YOU'LL BE A ENCOURAGED TO LEARN THAT GUY CAL FIRE LOCALLY HAS VERY UNIQUE AGREEMENTS NOW WITHOUT YOUR NAVY AND MARINE SO THAT THEY TRAIN TOGETHER. AND WE CAN CALL -- FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SUPPORT LOCALLY WHEN THERE IS A BIG FIRE BUT I THINK. ANOTHER THING THAT -- THAT HAPPENS DURING THOSE THE AND THREE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN RELATES. SOMEWHAT TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN MORE RECENTLY AND YOU ASKED ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT COULD BE DONE -- WHAT CAN IMPROVE UPON IT'S BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED THAT IN THE FIRES IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT? UP PROBLEMS WITH WITH ALERT AND WARNING AND SO THE STATE IS IS STEPPING UP AND YOU KNOW GOING TO BE SOON RELEASING SOME SOME GUIDELINES BUT TRAINING TO GO ALONG WITH THAT FOR LOCALS -- BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A TWO DAYS DOWN THE ROAD RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT WHEN THE FIRE BREAKS OUT GETTING THE WORD TO PEOPLE ON WHAT PROTECTIVE ACTIONS THEY NEED TO TAKE IMMEDIATELY. AND SO I KNOW THAT SOMETHING THE STATE'S WORKING ON BUT THE ROLLING OUT THAT TRAINING AND HAVING THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HAVE THAT SOFTWARE AND THOSE RESOURCES TO ALERT THE PUBLIC IS CRITICAL. WITH GREAT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH WE NOW HAVE BUT WE'RE OPEN FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE -- TO HAVE A MINUTE -- TO HAVE SOME COMMENTS CONCERNING WHAT THEY'VE HEARD -- IF SO -- PLEASE COME TO THE MIKE THE MICROPHONE IS THERE MAKE SURE YOU GIVE US YOUR NAME.
