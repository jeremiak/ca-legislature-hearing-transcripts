PRODUCTION TODAY. THEN THERE'S

00:24:22.194 --> 00:24:23.495
BLUE HYDROGEN WHICH IS HYDROGEN

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:25.297
THAT'S PRODUCED FROM FOSSIL FUEL

00:24:25.363 --> 00:24:28.900
FEEDSTOCKS. WITH CARBON CAPTURE

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:31.636
THE BOARD PRODUCTION. BOB AND-

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:33.505
THAT CAN SOME- IT'S NOT ALL OF

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.174
THE OF THE- NATION'S AND THEN

00:24:36.241 --> 00:24:38.710
FINALLY- THERE'S GREEN HYDROGEN.

00:24:38.777 --> 00:24:40.512
WHICH ENCOMPASSES A BUNCH OF

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.780
CARBON NEUTRAL PRODUCTION

00:24:41.847 --> 00:24:43.448
PATHWAYS INCLUDING ELECTRICAL

00:24:43.515 --> 00:24:45.350
ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN WHICH IS

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:47.085
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS POWER TO GAS

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:47.853
WHICH IS THE CONVERSION OF

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:51.156
ELECTRICAL POWER. INTO GASHES

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:54.860
ENERGY- OUR AND- THERE'S OTHER

00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:56.661
4 DEGREES HYDROGEN- THAT CAN BE

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:59.464
DONE. AS WELL SO THOSE ARE

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:00.866
ROUGHLY THE THREE TYPES THERE

00:25:00.932 --> 00:25:02.601
ARE SOME DIFFERENT COLORS YOU

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.369
KNOW ABOUT BLACK HUNDRED WHICH

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.538
IS AT THE CORE PINK IDEAS AND

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:07.939
FOR NUCLEAR BUT THESE ARE THE

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:09.708
THREE BIG ONES- AND SO THE COST

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:12.244
POSITION YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:12.878
RIGHT OF THE SLIDE. OUR GREAT

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:14.646
HAD HIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:17.983
TODAY- RIGHT ABOUT TWO DOLLARS A

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:21.119
KILOGRAM- BLUE HYDROGEN- BUT TO

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:22.821
TWENTY SEVEN AND THEN ROUGHLY

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.055
FIVE TO NINE DOLLARS FOR GREEN

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:26.591
HYDROGEN ALTHOUGH- WITH SKILL

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:31.296
THOSE NUMBERS CAN CAN COME DOWN-

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.831
BECAUSE NEXT WHAT. SO IN TERMS

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.332
OF USE FOR HYBRID I THINK THIS

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:36.434
IS REALLY. THE CENTRAL QUESTION

00:25:36.501 --> 00:25:38.370
BEFORE US I THINK IT'S CLEAR

00:25:38.436 --> 00:25:40.272
HYDROGEN. DOES HAVE A ROLE TO

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:41.606
PLAY IN THE QUESTION IS REALLY

00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:43.575
WHAT ARE THE SWIM LANES AND I

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:45.243
SHOULD JUST PREFACE THIS BY

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:48.113
SAYING THAT. WE ARE ABOUT TO DO

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:49.748
A CONTRACT TO FIND A HYDROGEN

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.850
ROADMAP WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:53.752
THIS- DOES THAT WORK- FROM A

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:56.087
RESEARCH PERSPECTIVE IS ONGOING

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:56.955
BUT ROUGHLY THE THREE

00:25:57.022 --> 00:25:59.057
CATEGORIES. THAT WE SEE HAD

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.726
GOING- LONG TERM OR TO HELP

00:26:01.793 --> 00:26:04.763
SUPPORT THE ELECTRIC GRID- TO DO

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:06.831
THE HARD TO TRANSPORTATION THAT

00:26:06.898 --> 00:26:09.301
ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY. AND THEN

00:26:09.367 --> 00:26:11.102
SOME HARD TO ELECTRIFY

00:26:11.169 --> 00:26:13.672
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS- JUST ON

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:14.572
THE ELECTRIFICATION PIZZA

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:15.941
TRANSPORTATION SINCE THAT'S GOT

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:18.276
A LOT OF ATTENTION. I DO WANT TO

00:26:18.343 --> 00:26:21.579
COME A LEVEL SET THERE- WE- HAVE

00:26:21.646 --> 00:26:23.581
BEEN PUTTING IN A LOT OF

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.483
INVESTMENT INTO THE SPACE. AND I

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.485
CAN TELL YOU YOU KNOW AT THIS

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:29.187
POINT I THINK HEAVY DUTY IS

00:26:29.254 --> 00:26:30.789
REALLY. OF THE MUCH BETTER NEED

00:26:30.855 --> 00:26:33.391
SH SO- BLOOMBERG NEW ENERGY

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:36.361
FINANCE TRACKS. NEW VEHICLE

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.030
MODEL INTRODUCTIONS- THERE ARE

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:42.367
PUBLIC. AND TODAY BY. TWENTY

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:45.136
TWENTY FOUR. THEY ARE PROJECTING

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:45.937
FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MODELS

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:48.106
OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE COMING

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:51.009
TO MARKET OTHER ANNOUNCED AND-

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.410
THREE MODELS HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:53.445
VEHICLES OF THE PASSENGERS PICKS

00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:56.281
LIKE TO TRACK SO. ON THE ON THE-

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:57.515
TRANSPORTATION SIDE WE REALLY

00:26:57.582 --> 00:26:59.084
SEE A LOT OF MOMENTUM FOR

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:02.053
ELECTRIC ON PASSENGER BUT- HEAVY

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.188
DUTY WHERE THERE'S LONG HAUL

00:27:03.254 --> 00:27:04.489
ROUTES I THINK IS IT IS

00:27:04.556 --> 00:27:06.524
IMPORTANT EACH AND- SO A LOT OF

00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.860
THE INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING ON

00:27:08.927 --> 00:27:09.627
THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE ARE TO

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:11.796
SUPPORT THAT. WE HAVE ABOUT

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:13.798
FIFTY FIVE HYDROGEN. REFUELLING

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:16.034
STATIONS TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:17.702
EXPECT TO GET TWO HUNDRED BY THE

00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:19.537
END OF NEXT YEAR. OUR STATE

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:25.176
GOAL. OF TWO HUNDRED BY THE END

00:27:25.243 --> 00:27:27.412
OF. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE- NEXT

00:27:27.479 --> 00:27:28.813
MONTH. SO SOME OF THE LIMIT OF

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.082
THAT URGES NEED TO WORK THROUGH

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:32.617
THE COST IS- CURRENTLY GREEN. IS

00:27:32.684 --> 00:27:35.587
MORE. THAN GRAD TO PER- AND SO

00:27:35.653 --> 00:27:36.788
THAT'S SOMETHING CAN COME DOWN

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:37.956
WITH SKILLED WITH FURTHER

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:39.624
INNOVATION BUT THAT'S WHERE WE

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:42.127
ARE TODAY- THE PIPELINE CAPACITY

00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:44.195
LIMITS THAT EXIST. ARE ALSO ARE

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:47.799
A CONCERN- SO WE COULD GET UP TO

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:49.634
TWENTY PERCENT. THIS IS 20%

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.336
BLAND- IN THE EXISTING NATURAL

00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:54.072
GAS PIPELINE- BUT THAT STILL

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:55.507
DOESN'T FULLY DECARBONISE THE

00:27:55.573 --> 00:27:57.242
PIPELINE YOU CAN'T GO FURTHER

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:59.511
THAN THAT- BECAUSE OF THE

00:27:59.577 --> 00:28:01.679
LIMITATIONS WITH THE GAS THAT'S

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:04.249
SUCH A SMALL MOLECULE-

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:07.552
DEFICIENCY IS- IS NOT IS. AS

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:08.753
GOOD A DIFFERENT CERTAINLY FOR

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.455
LIKE TO GET CALLS ABOUT TWICE AS

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.357
MUCH ELECTRICITY PER MILES ABOUT

00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:14.726
ELECTRIC VEHICLE- AND THEN

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.494
THOUGH FOR EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGIES

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.363
LIKE HE PUMPED WATER HEATING.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:19.664
ARE IT'S ABOUT FOUR TIMES WORTH

00:28:19.731 --> 00:28:21.099
MISSIONS TO ELECTROCUTE PUMPED

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.133
AND HYDROGEN- THOSE

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.436
APPLICATIONS- AND THEN THERE'S

00:28:24.502 --> 00:28:25.904
STILL YOUR POLLUTION FROM

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.539
COMBUSTION SO. HIS ARE ALL

00:28:27.605 --> 00:28:28.840
ISSUES TO WORK THROUGH AND I

00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.308
THINK REALLY THE MAIN QUESTION

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.043
HERE'S AGAIN YOU KNOW WHAT ARE

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.312
THE OPTIMAL SOME LANES. FOR

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:37.882
HYDROGEN AS WE GO FORWARD TO-

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:43.688
OUR. CLIMATE GOALS OUR NEXT

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:45.190
LINE. SO HOW DO CHEN VESTMENTS

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.758
THAT WE MAY- AT THE ENERGY.

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:47.492
TODAY ALSO IT'S OVER QUARTER

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.594
BILLION DOLLARS- AND JUST FOR

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:52.997
CONTEXT. THAT IS MORE. THAN IT

00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.332
EVERY SINGLE NATION IN THE WORLD

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:56.067
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF JAPAN ON

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:58.203
ABSOLUTE BASIS. AND IT'S NUMBER

00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:59.737
ONE IN THE WORLD ON A PER CAPITA

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:01.773
BASIS MOST OF THAT INVESTMENT

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.708
HAS GONE TOWARDS. THE

00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:06.377
TRANSPORTATION SIDE- FOR A

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:08.113
REFUELING STATIONS THERE'S ALSO

00:29:08.179 --> 00:29:09.781
BEEN SOME INVESTMENTS THROUGH

00:29:09.848 --> 00:29:12.016
OUR EPIC PROGRAMS. AND OTHER

00:29:12.083 --> 00:29:13.885
DEMONSTRATION- YOU KNOW

00:29:13.952 --> 00:29:14.986
INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AND SO

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:17.322
FORTH AND THEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.858
BUDGET- THAT'S PROPOSED FOR

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.192
TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE YEARS A

00:29:21.259 --> 00:29:22.360
HUNDRED MILLION. UP FOR THAT

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:23.761
THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON NON

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:26.331
FOSSEL HYDROGEN. HOW TO EXPAND

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:28.199
THE MARKET FOR THAT AND- WE HOPE

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:32.537
THAT INVESTMENT WILL HELP DRIVE

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.771
DOWN SO THE COST WE'RE TALKING

00:29:33.838 --> 00:29:37.008
UP. AND IT IS IN A WE'RE DOING-

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:37.509
THE STUDENTS TO BILLION

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:39.878
ALTOGETHER FOR. OUR RECHARGING

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:41.779
REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

00:29:41.846 --> 00:29:43.515
BUDGET AND SO WE EXPECT SOME OF

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.550
THAT WILL GO TOWARD SOME OUTSIDE

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:48.586
REGION IN OUR- I TRANSPORTATION

00:29:48.653 --> 00:29:52.056
PROGRAM BUDGET EXCELLENT. SO

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:53.658
JUST TO LEVEL SET AGAIN ON THE

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:56.494
STATIONS- WE'RE AT FIFTY FIVE

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:59.430
TODAY HUNDRED BY ANY NEXT YEAR

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:00.532
TWO HUNDRED BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:30:00.598 --> 00:30:02.500
FIVE WHICH IS THE STATE COAL-

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.269
THAT'S ANOTHER TO SUPPORT I

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:06.504
BELIEVE TWO HUNDRED NINETY

00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:09.073
THOUSAND VEHICLES- YOU KNOW NOT

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.177
INTENDED THAT SCENARIO- ART SO

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:14.045
THAT IS WHERE WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.680
KEEPING TO THE DIRECTIVE AN

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:16.814
EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT IS A

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:19.817
CIRCLE- IN THE DIRECTION OF THE

00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:20.685
LEGISLATURE HONEST BUT THAT'S

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:24.722
THE KIND OF. STATUS BUT DID FOR

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:27.158
YOU AND ROUGHLY THE COST PER

00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:30.128
STATION IS ABOUT ONE POINT TWO

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:35.300
MILLION DOLLARS- HYDROGEN. ARE

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:36.501
REFUELING STATION CALIFORNIA.

00:30:36.568 --> 00:30:38.503
EXCELLENT I THINK I THINK THAT

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.805
WAS IT SO I'M HAPPY TO OPEN UP

00:30:40.872 --> 00:30:43.274
TO QUESTIONS OR OR HEAR FROM

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:44.442
SURE RIGHT OFF WE CAN TAKE

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:48.112
pWE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE SECOND

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:51.349
SPEAKER AND THEN DO QUESTIONS-

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.351
TO THE TWO OF YOU I BELIEVE. AND

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.686
I THINK THAT WE'RE OUR SECOND

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:55.887
SPEAKERS WILL BE CRAIG SIEGEL

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.255
FROM THE CALIFORNIA AIR

00:30:57.322 --> 00:31:00.191
RESOURCES BOARD. THAT'S RIGHT

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:02.794
CHAIRS AND- CHAIR AND OFF WAS

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.628
UNAVOIDABLY DETAINED AT THE LAST

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:05.330
MINUTE AND SENDS HER REGRETS IN

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:06.831
REGARDS SO YOU'LL HALF AND

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:07.865
FRAYED TO SETTLE THE POOR

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.701
SUBSTITUTE IN ME. I'M CRAIG

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:10.902
SEGAL AND DEPUTY EXECUTIVE

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:11.970
OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA AIR

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.838
RESOURCES BOARD WAY FOCUS ON

00:31:13.905 --> 00:31:15.573
MOBILE SOURCES INCENTIVES AND

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.041
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:31:17.108 --> 00:31:18.576
SPEAK HERE WITH YOU TODAY.

00:31:18.643 --> 00:31:19.911
ALTHOUGH MANY APPLICATIONS FOR

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:21.412
HYDROGEN INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.214
ENERGY STORAGE APPLICATIONS I'LL

00:31:23.281 --> 00:31:24.649
BE FOCUSING MY DISCUSSION TO IT

00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:26.484
AS A TRANSPORTATION FUEL NEXT

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:28.620
SLIDE PLEASE. FIRST I'D LIKE TO

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:29.854
TALK ABOUT- INCENTIVES FOR THE

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.522
USE OF GREENER HYDROGEN AS A

00:31:31.589 --> 00:31:33.191
VEHICLE FUEL. THE LOW CARBON

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.759
FUEL STANDARD IS CALIFORNIA'S

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.728
MAIN PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE THE

COMMERCIALLY SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS

00:40:48.045 --> 00:40:49.246
IS RAMPED UP STATE TIME AND THEN

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.514
ACCELERATE. FURTHER OTHER MUCH

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.682
IS BEING DISCUSSED OVER VARIOUS

00:40:51.749 --> 00:40:53.551
COLORS OF HYDROGEN. BROWN

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.219
BLUEGREEN ETCETERA THERE'S A HER

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.887
A STICKS AND ULTIMATELY WE CAN'T

00:40:56.954 --> 00:40:58.455
HOLD ONE TECHNOLOGY TO COMBAT

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.890
AIR POLLUTION CLIMATE CHANGE A

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:01.392
HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHERS.

00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:02.626
ANYTHING THAT IS CLEANER THAN

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:04.128
FOSSIL FUELS HELPS WHICH IS ONE

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.196
REASON THESE CARBON INTENSITY

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:07.164
METRICS HELP US SEE CLEARLY. I

00:41:07.231 --> 00:41:08.532
BILLS THAT YOU DIFFICULT AND TOO

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:09.667
IMPORTANT NOT TO USE EVERY TOOL

00:41:09.733 --> 00:41:11.869
IN THE TOOLBOX. WE MUST BE

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:13.103
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:13.704
TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE OVER

00:41:13.771 --> 00:41:15.739
TIME AS A PROGRAMS HELP THEM DO.

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.107
A PATIENT THAT PERTINI TO

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.542
PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:20.477
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY

00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:24.548
MUCH. THANK YOU- I THINK I WILL.

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.250
SEE IF ANY OF THE OTHER

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:29.854
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.255
BEFORE I ASK MY OWN. MISTER

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:34.091
BENNETT SURE GO AHEAD. OKAY WILL

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:36.193
DO BENNETT AND THEN WILL DO

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.328
MISTER MCCARTY IN THE MISTER

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:41.599
KALRA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH-

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:46.437
SHARE. FRIEDMAN OF THEY JUST

00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:47.671
MAKE A QUICK COMMENT SO THAT MY

00:41:47.738 --> 00:41:48.906
QUESTIONS ARE NOT MISSED

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:52.042
MISCONSTRUED BUT I CLEARLY THINK

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:53.544
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GO

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.446
GREEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE GET

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:58.015
TO A 100% GREEN HYDROGEN AS SOON

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:01.285
AS POSSIBLE- SECOND- I THINK

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:03.621
pIT'S REALLY HEALTHY IF WE MAKE

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:07.224
SURE THAT WE KEEP AS MANY AS AS-

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:09.326
THE CAR BUT A SPOKESPERSON THERE

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:10.794
JUST TO JUST MENTION THAT WE

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.296
KEEP AS MANY TECHNOLOGIES

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.732
AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE I HARK

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:16.467
BACK TO THE NINETEEN FIFTIES

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:18.369
WHEN THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.938
ENGINE COMPANIES- PURCHASED UP

00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.172
THE PATENTS FOR ALL OF THE

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:24.408
ELECTRIC CARS. AND DESTROYED

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.176
DOES HOW MUCH DIFFERENT THE

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:27.811
WORLD WOULD BE TODAY- FOR THE

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.480
LAST SEVENTY YEARS WE WOULD HAVE

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.382
HAD ELECTRIC CAR TECHNOLOGY

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:32.850
COMPETING WITH INTERNAL

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:35.586
COMBUSTION TECHNOLOGY AND ALL

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:38.222
THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD HAVE

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:39.690
TAKEN PLACE- SO. WHEN I ASK

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:41.225
THESE QUESTIONS THAT THEY'RE

00:42:41.292 --> 00:42:42.793
THEY'RE NOT QUESTIONS THAT HAVE

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.561
ANY NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.497
TOWARDS ELECTRICITY AND BATTERY

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:48.799
POWERED CARS WE NEED BOTH- NOT

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:51.235
JUST CARS BUT IT'S IN THE HOLE

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.437
TRANSPORTATION- SECTOR- BUT MY

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:56.640
QUESTION- FOR- I THINK BOTH

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.609
PROBABLY SEE YOU SEE. MORE

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:00.644
APPROPRIATELY- THERE'S A

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:03.113
REFERENCE TO THE ELECTRICITY

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.216
BEING MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:07.584
NEEDED THREE THOUSAND KILOWATT

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:10.688
HOURS- FOR- TEN THOUSAND MILES

00:43:10.754 --> 00:43:13.924
IN A BATTERY CAR- SEVEN THOUSAND

00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:15.526
THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT HOURS FOR

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:16.694
TEN THOUSAND MILES AND A- FUEL

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.431
CELL VEHICLE- I ASSUME THAT-

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:24.802
THAT THAT DATA. FROM. SIX

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:26.670
STANDARD IS IT THE BEST

00:43:26.737 --> 00:43:30.674
ELECTROLYSIS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.176
OUT THERE TODAY IS THAT CORRECT

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:34.244
. THAT PROCESS IS ESTIMATED TO

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:35.312
HAVE SOMEONE YEAH FOR THE

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:36.880
QUESTION ACTUALLY MY ADVISER CAN

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:40.017
RIDER DID THAT. CALCULATION CAN

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:43.420
ARE YOU ARE YOU ON. YES HELLO

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:46.623
SOME YEAH THAT THAT'S BASED ON

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.892
THE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT HAVE

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:51.128
LOOKED AT THE WORLD WE- THERE

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:52.663
ARE A FEW DIFFERENT PATHWAYS

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.431
ACTUALLY THEY THE COMPRESSOR

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:56.100
METHODOLOGY IN TRANSPORTATION

00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:58.302
AND OTHERS LARGER DIVERGENCE

00:43:58.369 --> 00:43:59.937
ANYTHING EFFICIENTLY WHERE IF

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.972
YOU SOME OF THE QUALIFIED

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:03.674
PERSONS COMPRESSED WE USED TO

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:08.045
AND- FAVORABLY FOR THE- HYDROGEN

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:10.914
DISTRIBUTION THERE- BUT THERE

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.017
THAT BUILDERS EASY CALCULATION

00:44:13.083 --> 00:44:14.785
BUT THERE ARE OTHER STUDIES

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:19.957
THAT- CORROBORATE- THAT.

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:20.591
RELATIVE EFFICIENCY. USING THE

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:22.993
LIQUID OR THE GAS FORM RECEIVING

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.929
GOT GREAT. BLOCKING YOUR HIGHER

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:28.332
OR WITH YOU LIKE WOULD WITH

00:44:28.399 --> 00:44:30.167
MICHAEL AND MY THE NEXT QUESTION

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:31.835
WITH THAT IS THAT- THERE'S A

00:44:31.902 --> 00:44:34.838
REFERENCE IN THE REPORT- AND

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:37.307
THIS COMPARES HYDROGEN AND

00:44:37.374 --> 00:44:38.842
BATTERY TECH AND FUEL CELL AND

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.611
BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ON THE

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:42.846
ELECTRICITY NEEDED TO PRODUCE

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.915
TEN THOUSAND MILES- IS THERE A

00:44:44.982 --> 00:44:46.650
COMPARISON OUT THERE IN TERMS OF

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:49.353
TOTAL LIFECYCLE- WITH THE NUMBER

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.822
OF RARE EARTHS AND- MINERALS

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:55.192
pEARTH MINERALS NEEDED FOR

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.627
BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES AND FUEL

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:59.563
CELL TECHNOLOGY AND IS THERE A

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.098
STUDY OUT THERE THAT WOULD

00:45:01.165 --> 00:45:04.134
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW MUCH.

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:05.235
HOW MUCH GREENHOUSE GAS

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:07.404
EMISSIONS WILL THERE BE IN THE

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.939
MINING OF RARE EARTH MINERALS I

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.774
KNOW WE HAVE- WE'RE VERY

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:12.309
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE SOURCE OF

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:14.044
LITHIUM BUT THERE ARE OTHER RARE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.212
EARTH MINERALS THAT ARE ALSO

00:45:15.279 --> 00:45:17.281
GOING TO BE REQUIRED- FOR

00:45:17.347 --> 00:45:19.216
BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. ARE THERE

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:20.884
FEWER RARE EARTH MINERALS THAT

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.586
ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED FOR THE

00:45:22.653 --> 00:45:24.621
HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY. YEAH THAT'S

00:45:24.688 --> 00:45:27.558
A GREAT QUESTION- SO IF YOU'LL

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:28.859
SELECTRIC VEHICLES USING

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:31.462
ELECTRIC DRIVETRAIN SO MANY OF

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:34.064
THEM ARE THE SAME SO FOR

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.265
EXAMPLE. DO YOU DINAMIC PRESENT

00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:36.733
ANY- YOU KNOW IN THE BACK THAT'S

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.603
AND SO FORTH. BUT OTHERS LIKE

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:43.841
LITHIUM. NICKEL COBALT. YEAH AND

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:49.046
THE BATTERIES- DID YOU SEE

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:49.680
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WOULD NOT BE.

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.116
IN ALL THE I'M HAVING SAID THAT

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:53.617
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE BATTERY

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:56.086
INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW. IS A

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:59.156
MOVEMENT AWAY FROM- SO THERE'S

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.491
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO IT

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.326
SPARKS JUST OPENED A FACTORY IN

00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:04.628
AND CALIFORNIA'S DOING COBALT

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:07.397
FREE LITHIUM ION. AND NICKEL

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:10.767
FREE. ACTUALLY SO OVER TIME THE

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:13.203
NUMBER OF THOSE YOURS IS GOING

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:14.605
TO GO DOWN- I DON'T KNOW IF

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:15.939
THERE'S ANYTHING UNIQUE

00:46:16.006 --> 00:46:17.241
OBSTRUCTING IS ANY OTHER

00:46:17.307 --> 00:46:19.977
REPRESENTS ENOUGH FUEL CELL

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:22.179
VEHICLE THAT WOULDN'T BE THAT

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.181
EASY IT IDON'T I DON'T BELIEVE

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:25.949
THERE ARE. BUT I THINK ALL ADAMA

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:26.984
IS IN TERMS OF LIFE CYCLE

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:28.218
EMISSIONS WE SEE DRAMATICALLY

00:46:28.285 --> 00:46:30.087
LOWER EMISSIONS FROM BOTH KIND

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:31.555
OF THE V. BOTH BATTERY ELECTRIC

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.724
AND FUEL CELLS THAT YOU

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:34.658
TRADITIONAL SUIT GAS OR DIESEL

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.494
FLOWER POWER TRUCK. AND IN BOTH

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:40.531
CASES THANKS TO TOOLS INCLUDING

00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:41.598
IT CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION THE

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.567
GRAD AND THE CONTINUING LOW

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:46.036
CARBON FUEL STANDARD SIGNAL ON

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:46.837
CARBON INTENSITY THE SKILLS

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.038
CONTINUE TO GET LAST COVINGTON'S

00:46:48.105 --> 00:46:50.674
OVERTIME SAYS YOUR MISSION

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.075
VEHICLE PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:54.645
IMPROVE. I RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.246
OF THEM WITH IMPROVEMENTS WILL

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.749
HAVE FOR LIFE CYCLES I'M JUST

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:00.684
CURIOUS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.219
THAT'S OUT THERE NOW IF YOU TOOK

00:47:02.286 --> 00:47:03.854
FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END

00:47:03.921 --> 00:47:05.989
LIFE CYCLE COST YOU HAVE A- A

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.524
BIG BATTERY THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:09.126
DEAL WITH IN TERMS OF RECYCLING

00:47:09.193 --> 00:47:11.328
AND- FUEL CELL YOU HAVE A MUCH

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:13.330
SMALLER BATTERY. TO ALMOST THAT

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.532
OF THE BATTERY THE SIZE OF IN A

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:17.768
PASSENGER CAR AT THIS POINT

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:19.703
TIME- SO RIGHT NOW IN COMPARISON

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:21.738
DO YOU HAVE- IS THERE AND NOW

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:23.373
THIS IS THIS IS RIGHT NOW TOTAL

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:28.245
LIFECYCLE. COST IT DO DO WE HAVE

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:33.350
THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS. TO COOK

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:33.984
OR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO.

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.886
YES WE DO AFTER AND THERE'S A

00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:37.187
USEFUL STUDY- THE INTERNATIONAL-

00:47:37.254 --> 00:47:38.222
COMMITTEE AND CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:40.090
THAT OFFER. GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:42.359
SENIOR DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED-

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.094
BICYCLE FISHING SEES THAT STUDY

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.929
WHICH IS FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

00:47:45.996 --> 00:47:47.564
I'M EVEN IN THE U. S.'S POWER

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:49.366
GRANTED WHICH TENDS TO BE STILL

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:50.701
RELATIVELY HIGH CARBON INTENSITY

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:52.903
RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA. IT'S

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.671
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ORDER OF ON

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:57.507
IT 60% OR MORE. THAT'S TRUE

00:47:57.574 --> 00:47:59.276
WEALTHY SPEAKING FOR FUEL CELL

00:47:59.343 --> 00:48:00.978
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL I THINK IT'S

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.579
ALSO IN THAT SERVE SIXTY

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:04.448
PERCENT. LEVEL I'D BE HAPPY TO

00:48:04.514 --> 00:48:05.716
MAKE SURE THAT STUDY SHARED BACK

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.684
OVER TO YOU- THROUGH OUR

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.820
LEGISLATIVE SO IF I CAN JUST BE

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.455
CLEAR LACK LIFE CYCLE OF A OF A

00:48:11.521 --> 00:48:14.891
FUEL CELL POWERED BY. THIS A

00:48:14.958 --> 00:48:17.027
HEAVY DUTY TRUCK LIFECYCLE FUEL

00:48:17.094 --> 00:48:19.730
CELLAR CELL FUEL CELL POWERED

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:22.532
HEAVY DUTY TRUCK LIFE CYCLE OF A

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:24.768
BATTERY POWERED HEAVY DUTY TRUCK

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:25.936
. WHICH ONE HAS THE BETTER

00:48:26.003 --> 00:48:28.939
OVERALL LIFECYCLE IMPACT. YOU

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.574
KNOW I THINK I SEE SIMILAR

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.975
BENEFITS USING FUEL CELLS AND

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:34.011
BATTERIES BUT GET ARE PRETTY

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:34.911
HEAVILY ON THE USE ALL RIGHT

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:38.181
THANK YOU. AND THEN- AND THEN IF

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:39.950
I COULD JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION-

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:42.286
I NOTED YOUR REPORT THAT THE

00:48:42.352 --> 00:48:44.721
BIDEN MINISTRATION HAS-

00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:47.124
ALLOCATED EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.159
TO TRY TO CREATE FOR REGIONAL-

00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:54.298
CENTERS. OUT THERE- IT TO CREATE

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:56.199
GREEN HYDROGEN SO GREEN HIDES A

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:59.202
CLEAN HYDROGEN HUBS OF FOUR OF

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:02.039
THEM IN THE UNITED STATES SO-

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.674
NOT GREAT AT MATH BUT THAT'S TWO

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.742
BILLION DOLLARS EACH I THINK OF

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:08.078
THIS EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS- WHAT

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:10.447
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AS

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:11.381
A LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO HELP

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:14.117
MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA. IS ONE OF

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:16.486
THE SITES OF THOSE FOUR REGIONAL

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:21.258
HUBS. SO YEAH THANK YOU SO MANY.

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.160
PEOPLE WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS A FEW

00:49:23.226 --> 00:49:25.562
WEEKS AGO I WOULD. YEAH WE'RE

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:27.264
VERY INTERESTED TO SUPPORT

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:29.566
FEDERAL DOLLARS FROM INSTRUCTORS

00:49:29.633 --> 00:49:31.501
PACKAGE COMPANY CALIFORNIA FOR.

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:32.636
EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THERE

00:49:32.703 --> 00:49:35.305
EVERYTHING FROM CARBON CAPTURE

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:37.741
TWO TWO BATTERIES TO HOW DO YOU

00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:38.775
. AND WE HAVE TO GT JIM WITH

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.744
THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS I THINK

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:42.813
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. HAVE A

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:45.649
CONVENING- OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.283
BRING TOGETHER DIFFERENT

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.118
STAKEHOLDERS OR WORKING IN THE

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:51.254
SPACE TO TRY TO GET ALIGNMENT.

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:52.989
BONTA OVERALL CALIFORNIA

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.592
PROPOSAL- THAT'S CERTAINLY MY

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:57.461
HOPE I BELIEVE THAT. BY THE

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:00.397
MONEY WILL GO FARTHER STE- IF

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:02.099
IT'S IN CALIFORNIA JUST GIVEN

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:04.601
THE- EXPERTISE THIS YEAR IN

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.470
STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:11.708
YOU CHAIR. THANK YOU AB ASSEMBLY

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.944
MEMBERS FOR SHARING THIS AND

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:16.480
JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON- THE

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.482
QUESTIONS YOU MISTER BENNETT.

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:19.850
SAID ABOUT ASK ABOUT THE

00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:21.618
ECONOMICS OF THE STATIONS AND

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.353
THEN JUST COMPARE SING- BIG

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.690
PICTURE THE FUEL CELL HYDROGEN

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.892
AND THE ELECTRIC CARS BUT YEAH

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:33.230
BIG PICTURE WE ALL REALIZE THAT-IN ORDER TO TACKLE OUR CLIMATE

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.631
CHANGE GOALS ARE GHG REDUCTIONS

00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.299
AND- AIR POLLUTION THROUGHOUT

00:50:36.366 --> 00:50:37.601
OUR COMMUNITIES AT. THAT'S WILL

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:40.170
NEVER TALK ABOUT FRANKLY. IS-

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:43.373
GLOBAL SOURCES AND SO GETTING-

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.642
CLEAN CARS. ON THE ROAD IN

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.077
GETTING POLLUTING CARS OFF THE

00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:48.612
ROAD IS YOU KNOW NOT ROCKET

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:50.480
SCIENCE BUT THE DETAILS ARE WHAT

00:50:50.547 --> 00:50:52.449
MATTER AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:54.451
EASY OR ELSE WE WOULD DONE THIS

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:56.353
A LONG TIME AGO AS WAS NOTED.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.789
CERTAINLY THE COST OF THE

00:50:58.855 --> 00:50:59.956
INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMETHING THAT

00:51:00.023 --> 00:51:01.792
THAT IS HIS CAME OUT CAN WE GO

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.627
BACK TO THAT SLIDE THE YOU HAD

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:06.196
WERE AT AND IN CALIFORNIA TODAY.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.731
VERSUS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE FOR

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.500
IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:11.501
NUMBER OF STATIONS. I THINK IT

00:51:11.568 --> 00:51:14.371
WAS I THINK WAS THE LAST LINE OF

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:17.007
MARKET YEAH. YES SIR CAN YOU

00:51:17.073 --> 00:51:18.008
TELL US FIFTY OR SO IN

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.343
CALIFORNIA FIFTY FIVE TODAY

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:21.511
HUNDRED BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:23.947
YES I KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE HERE

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:26.316
AND SECRETARY I BELIEVE THAT'S

00:51:26.383 --> 00:51:29.386
OVER IN WEST SAC RIGHT. AND YOU

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.888
SEE YOU SEE WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:34.024
A COST OF ONE. IT'S ABOUT ONE

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.325
ONE POINT TWO MILLION IS THE

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.093
PREPARATION FOR. YEAH THAT

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:39.396
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF IT'S A ONE

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.364
POINT SOMETHING MILLION PER

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:45.035
STATION. AND WE'RE PUTTING IN IN

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.703
THE BUDGET WHAT IS IT AGAIN OR

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.440
WAS IT ON THIS. PACKET HERE. HOW

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:53.009
MUCH STATE MONEY. WE'RE PUTTING

00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:58.582
A HUNDRED MILLION. FOR THESE.

00:51:58.648 --> 00:52:00.717
WELL THE HUNDRED MILLION IS FOR

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.620
GREEN HYDROGEN RICH AT LARGE THE

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:04.688
I SHOULD SAY YOU KNOW THAT MONEY

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:06.656
WE'VE SPENT MANY OF THESE ARE IN

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.158
THE PROCESS OF FIFTY FIVE

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:09.326
REPRESENT THE ONES THAT ARE

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:11.428
COMPLETED BILLABLE RIGHT NOW FOR

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.430
USERS BUT THERE'S A BUNCH MORE I

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:14.564
GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION IS TO

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:16.399
GET TO FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED OR TWO

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.668
HUNDRED HOW MUCH ARE WE ASSUMING

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:20.470
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.138
STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:25.609
NEEDS TO PUT UP FRONT FOR THE

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.210
ONE MILLION PER STATION BECAUSE

00:52:27.277 --> 00:52:28.545
OBVIOUSLY THE STATION'S GOING TO

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:29.980
GET SOME MONEY FROM THEIR

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:32.082
CONSUMERS MAY BE SIGNED OFF TO

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:33.350
MAKE IT PENCIL OUT WHICH IS WHY

00:52:33.416 --> 00:52:35.418
WE NEED THE SUBSIDY FOR A LOT OF

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.687
THINGS WE DO SO HOW MUCH OF IT

00:52:37.754 --> 00:52:39.556
DO WE NEED TO PUT IN THEIR PER

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:42.292
STATION TO MAKE THESE.

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.227
FINANCIALLY PENCIL OUT. YEAH SO

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:47.831
I THINK- AND- CANTOR CREEK

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:49.366
PLEASE CLICK THE FIVE MINUTES

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:52.702
REMEMBER THIS BUT I BELIEVE THAT

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:55.539
. THE STATE CONTRIBUTION FOR-

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.940
HUNDRED FUEL CELL STATIONS IS

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:59.175
SOMETHING ON THE ORDER 40% OF

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:02.178
THE TOTAL COST. AND ON THE TV

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:05.215
STATIONS IT'S ABOUT 30% SO JUST

00:53:05.282 --> 00:53:06.149
FOR COMPARISON LEVEL TWO

00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:08.018
CHARGING WOULD TYPICALLY BE

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.586
ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND FIVE

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:11.655
HUNDRED AND WE WOULD GIVE US

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:12.622
FORTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR GRANT

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:16.826
FOR THAT- YEAH THAT'S YOU KNOW.

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:17.961
THIS IS A KIND OF TROUBLES IN

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.863
OUR JUST DESSERTS ARE YOU GOING

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.431
STATIONS ARE MARKETS LIKE A GAS

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:24.467
STATION- BUT I BELIEVE IT'S LIKE

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:28.004
FOR KIDS- CRAZE THAT'S NOT RIGHT

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:29.573
TO YOU. THAT I BELIEVE SO BY

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.107
DEFERRED CAN IN YOUR KINGDOM

00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:33.577
YEAH YES- ROUGHLY OVER HALF HIS

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.345
THROUGH A SOME TYPE OF THE

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:37.480
SUBSIDY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND

00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:39.783
THEN EVENTUALLY WHEN THESE ARE

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.485
GONNA. AVAILABLE AND UTILIZED BY

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.987
THE PUBLIC ON A LARGER SCALE

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.589
IT'S LIKE A GAS STATION TODAY

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:47.624
WERE PEOPLE OPEN UP IN THE GET

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:50.794
MINOR PEOPLE PAY THEIR BILL- AND

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.761
JUST YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:54.698
JUST ENLIGHTEN US IN A IN A IN

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.333
A- LAY PERSON. WHY DO YOU THINK

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:59.135
IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.737
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ZERO

00:54:00.804 --> 00:54:01.705
EMISSION VEHICLES AGAIN I THINK

00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:03.540
WE SHOULD BE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:05.942
SO WHETHER THEIR BATTERY PLUGIN

00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:08.445
BY ELECTRICITY OR- HYDROGEN.

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:10.614
FUEL SELLERS YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.581
POTENTIALLY THERE'S SOME YOU

00:54:11.648 --> 00:54:12.983
KNOW ZERO EMISSION FUEL THAT'S

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:15.885
CREATED I DON'T KNOW THAT'S NOT

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:18.254
THERE TODAY BUT- WHAT. WHY DO WE

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.957
THINK THAT THAT- THE HYDROGEN

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:23.093
HAS LAGGED BEHIND AS FAR AS

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:24.861
BEING PICKED UP FROM. THE

00:54:24.928 --> 00:54:26.429
CONSUMERS AND THE MARKETPLACE

00:54:26.496 --> 00:54:29.366
VERSUS. BATTERY ZERO EMISSION

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:32.135
VEHICLES. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.437
THAT'S THE QUESTION AND I WOULD

00:54:34.504 --> 00:54:36.906
I WOULD JUST OPEN BY SAYING OUR

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.441
FIDELITY ULTIMATELY IS TO OUR

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.276
CLIMATE GOALS SO WE'RE NOT

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:42.312
COMING IN WITH ANY PREFERENCE

00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.747
OTHER THAN THE MOST PRAGMATIC

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:47.550
WAY TO REDUCE POLLUTION- AND YOU

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:49.686
KNOW WE FUNDED FOR A LONG TIME

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:50.453
ACTUALLY IT'S A BIT COLD

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.422
MEASURE. EVM STRUCTURE FEEL SOME

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.724
OF IT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED IS THE

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.693
COST OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.161
IT'S SORT OF SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.596
HAPPENED IN SOLAR WITH

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:02.432
CRYSTALLINE SILICON PANEL OF

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:04.367
SOLAR PANELS WE JUST SAW THIS

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:05.902
INCREDIBLE COST REDUCTIONS SO

00:55:05.969 --> 00:55:07.337
TEN YEARS AGO WAS ABOUT A

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:08.672
THOUSAND DOLLARS A KILOWATT HOUR

00:55:08.738 --> 00:55:11.141
LITHIUM ION BATTERY TODAY IT'S

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:11.708
ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY AND

00:55:11.775 --> 00:55:13.043
THERE'S A REALLY CREDIBLE

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:15.245
PATHWAY TO GET DOWN TO TWO SIXTY

00:55:15.311 --> 00:55:16.646
TO EIGHTY DOLLARS. FOR LITHIUM

00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.581
ION AND SO WHAT'S WHAT HAS

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.850
REALLY DRIVEN THIS IS THAT THE-

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.385
YAMS THAT ARE MAKING THE

00:55:22.452 --> 00:55:25.989
VEHICLES LOOKED AT THAT MASS AND

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:27.757
ALSO THE FACT THAT THE ELECTRIC

00:55:27.824 --> 00:55:29.859
SYSTEM IS UBIQUITOUS THERE'S

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:32.429
POWER EVERYWHERE IN EVERY HOME-

00:55:32.495 --> 00:55:34.464
WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.032
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:37.734
IN COMBAT YOU KNOW HOW TO BUILD

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:38.401
A NEW. HIGH COLLECTED SALT

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:40.570
CHARGEABLE UNITED AS THE RUN IT

00:55:40.637 --> 00:55:42.005
A SEPARATE PIPELINE

00:55:42.072 --> 00:55:45.241
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND SO THE WE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:47.243
HAVE A SONG THAT AND THEN WHAT

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.278
HAPPENS IT'S JUST BEEN

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:49.946
OVERWHELMING INVESTMENT IN

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.015
ELECTRIC VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SO

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:54.217
EVERY MAJOR CAR MANUFACTURER IN

00:55:54.284 --> 00:55:56.286
THE WORLD TODAY IS BUILDING

00:55:56.352 --> 00:55:57.554
ELECTRIC MODEL AND I THINK YOU

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.888
SAW THE SUPERBOWL THERE WERE

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.724
SEVEN ADS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:02.826
THAT OCCURRED ONLY TWO BEDS FOR

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.661
KNOWLEDGE OF VEHICLES FROM MY

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:14.170
****

00:56:14.237 --> 00:56:15.538
OF COURSE. EVERYBODY LOOKS AT

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.107
MARKET CAP AND THE FACT THAT.

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:20.110
TESLA BECAME THE MOST THE FIRST

00:56:20.176 --> 00:56:23.079
COMPANY TO. BURST KHARQAN WORLDS

00:56:23.146 --> 00:56:23.880
OF TO BE A TRILLION DOLLAR

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.282
COMPANY- HAS KIND OF RESETTING

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:28.718
SO THE MARKET IS REALLY BETTER

00:56:28.785 --> 00:56:30.086
JAMES. THE OEMS THAT ARE

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.989
FURTHEST ALONG AN EASY OPTION

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:35.358
CURVAS Y. THINK YOU SEE. FORWARD

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:37.694
NOW RISING WITH- YOU KNOW WHAT

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:39.562
TO DO WITH THE ELECTRIC F. ONE

00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.297
FIFTY AND SO FORTH THAT'S REALLY

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.565
THE MAIN. TREND THAT'S BEEN

00:56:42.632 --> 00:56:43.633
HAPPENING IN THE IN THE ART

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.869
INDUSTRY LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:46.870
I THINK ALL IT OFFER IN ADDITION

00:56:46.936 --> 00:56:48.638
TO CHURCHILL'S GOOD POINTS. ARE

00:56:48.705 --> 00:56:49.906
IN TERMS OF WHEN THEY HEAR

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:51.508
SOMEONE BRING YOUR QUESTION IS

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.475
GOING FORWARD AND HOW TO THINK

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.577
ABOUT THIS. I THINK I JUST SAY

00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:56.613
THAT NONE OF US KNOW. EXACTLY

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.314
WHAT THE PATH IS FOLKS TAKE TO

00:56:58.381 --> 00:57:00.016
AN END OF COMBUSTION. NO OTHER

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:02.152
IN HEAVY DUTY OR LIGHT DUTY. SO

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.586
IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND IS

00:57:03.653 --> 00:57:05.388
SUCH A GOOD THING THAT CAUGHT

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:06.723
THE PLUNGING COST OF BATTERIES

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.359
ENABLE ALL SORTS OF GREAT.

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:13.930
CHANGES. IN THE TRANSPORTATION

00:57:13.997 --> 00:57:16.266
SYSTEM. RALPH LOW. OF THAT. IN

00:57:16.332 --> 00:57:18.034
OUR MARKETS. IS GET UP TO ONE

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:18.902
HUNDRED. THERE'S VERY LIKELY TO

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.537
BE ROLLED A RANGE OF

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:21.171
TECHNOLOGIES AND DIFFERENT USES

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.472
AND USE CASES IT MAY BE

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:23.606
DIFFERENT STORIES AND

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:25.975
LIGHT DUTY SECTORS. SO ONE OF

00:57:26.042 --> 00:57:27.777
THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW YOU SEE

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:30.280
IN. THE PROGRAM SO FAR IS THIS

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:32.448
NEUTRALITY ESTÁ TECHNOLOGY IN

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:34.117
THIS DESIRE TO ENSURE SYSTEMS.

00:57:34.184 --> 00:57:37.654
ARE BROADLY AVAILABLE AND GIVEN.

00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.721
RESERVES ARE MOVING FROM A NICHE

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:40.723
TECHNOLOGY. TO THE ANSWER FOR

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:42.392
EVERYBODY ACROSS MANY USES. I'M

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:43.593
INTERESTED TO SEE HOW THE MARKET

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:46.996
DEVELOPS ACROSS MANY OF THESE

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:54.537
OPTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA.

00:57:54.604 --> 00:57:57.040
THANK YOU THINK YOUR CHAIRS FOR

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:59.375
HOLDING THIS MEETING- I DO

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:02.045
BELIEVE THAT- IT'S REALLY LONG

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.413
OVERDUE IN TERMS OF HAVING THE

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:05.114
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW HOW

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:08.785
HYDROGEN DOES FIT INTO ZERO

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.920
EMISSION IN THE FUTURES PRICE

00:58:10.987 --> 00:58:12.055
BUT IT APPLIES TRANSPORTATION

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:16.359
AND- IN LOOKING AT. THE ABILITY

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:20.230
TO SCALE IT I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:24.334
WHERE. IN THE URGENCY- TO MOVE

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.102
FORWARD AND EXPAND THE

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.637
APPLICATIONS NEEDS TO BE

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.705
BALANCED CERTAINLY WITH THE

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:30.740
SOURCING OF IT PARTICULARLY WHEN

00:58:30.807 --> 00:58:33.643
YOU LOOK AT- IN OF THE GREEN

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:35.278
HYDROGEN VERSUS GRAY AND BLUE

00:58:35.345 --> 00:58:37.680
HYDROGEN THINK THAT ALTHOUGH

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:44.020
CERTAINLY AT THIS POINT- THE-

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:46.289
ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTION. IS IT

00:58:46.356 --> 00:58:49.993
IS MORE OF A KIND OF- A MORE

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:52.795
INTENSIVE PROCESS I THINK THAT

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.664
WE NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:58.001
ABOUT MOVING TOO QUICKLY JUST TO

00:58:58.067 --> 00:59:01.871
EXPAND USAGE OF HYDROGEN. BY

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:03.640
CONTINUING TO GOING DOWN THE

00:59:03.706 --> 00:59:05.708
ROUTE OF USING FOSSIL FUELS TO

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:08.044
CREATE THE HYDROGEN I KNOW THAT

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:10.580
IN ORDER TO SCALE UP OF THAT AND

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:13.016
THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.150
IN THE CONVERSATION AS PART OF

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:17.553
THE PLAN OF HOW TO GET- A LARGER

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.157
WELL. A LARGER VOLUME OF USAGE-

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:24.494
BUT I DO I LIKE IT AS IT WAS

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.696
DISCUSSED AND IN THE REPORT-

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.932
FOCUSING ON WHAT USES ARE MOST

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:30.900
OF THEM MAKE THE MOST SENSE FOR

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:34.103
HYDROGEN AND IT IS SEEMS AND I

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:36.406
AGREE COMPLETELY ON KIND OF THE

00:59:36.472 --> 00:59:38.174
DIESEL. ON A SHORT HAUL THE

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.475
PORTS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE

00:59:39.542 --> 00:59:40.643
NUMBER IT'S REALLY INTERESTING

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.412
TO SEE WHAT THE PORT OF OAKLAND

00:59:42.478 --> 00:59:44.547
IS DOING. THAT IF WE KNOW THAT

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:45.415
THAT'S GOOD THAT IS. THE BEST

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:47.850
THE MOST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK SO

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:49.185
TO SPEAK IN TERMS OF USING OUR

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.254
HYDROGEN AND WE CAN DO IT IN A

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.722
WAY THAT WE'RE USING. REALLY

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:53.990
GREEN HYDROGEN- THAT THAT.

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:55.858
SHOULD BE UP AT LEAST IN THE

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:58.061
SHORT TERM. OR MUCH OF OUR

00:59:58.127 --> 00:59:59.829
RESOURCES SHOULD GO TOWARDS I

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:03.199
THINK THAT- GO PUTTING RESOURCES

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.734
INTO THE GRADING OF THE

01:00:04.801 --> 01:00:06.069
TECHNOLOGY I THINK WE'LL

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:12.141
FURTHER. MOVE US AWAY FROM LONG-TERM GOALS- IN TERMS OF- ZERO

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.444
MISSION GOALS FOR OUR STATE AND

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:15.278
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.713
EMISSIONS I KNOW THE- TECHNOLOGY

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:17.847
CHANGES. USUALLY WHEN

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.482
TECHNOLOGIES ARE NEWER THEY'RE

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.918
NOT AS EFFICIENT AS THEY ARE TWO

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:23.319
THREE FOUR FIVE TEN YEARS DOWN

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:24.754
THE LINE SO. I'M HOPEFUL THAT

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.622
WITH HYDROGEN IT'LL BE JUST THE

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:29.125
SAME AS WE SAW WITH SOLAR AND-

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:30.193
IN OVERSEEING THE CLUTCH OF

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.862
VEHICLES ON HAVE YOU. AND THE

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.897
ABILITY TO CREATE ENERGY TO

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:38.868
FUEL- IN A POLITE VEHICLE THAT

01:00:38.935 --> 01:00:40.503
YOUR VEHICLE IS MUCH DIFFERENT.

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:43.573
THE ABILITY TO FUEL I'M-

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:45.708
HYDROGEN VEHICLES BUT I'M HOPING

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.276
THAT WITH THE INVESTMENT WITH

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.678
THE STATE INVESTMENT WE CAN MOVE

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.880
IN A MORE POSITIVE ACTION SO. I

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:53.416
AM. I JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THAT

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:59.756
I DO HAVE- SOME. CONCERNS ABOUT

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:02.792
. USING A- AT. THE END L. NAMAN

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.861
. TO CREATE THIS. OTHERWISE

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:06.529
RENEWABLE POTENTIALLY RENEWABLE

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:09.132
SOURCE. AND SO- BUT I'M VERY

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:10.299
GRATEFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATION

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:11.567
BECAUSE I THINK AGAIN IS LONG

01:01:11.634 --> 01:01:13.536
OVERDUE. AND IT'S SOMETHING I

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.638
THINK WE NEED TO REVISIT. A

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.206
PRETTY REGULARLY AS TECHNOLOGY

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:18.074
CONTINUES TO ADVANCE AND

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.809
HOPEFULLY IN A DIRECTION WE CAN

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:20.877
GET MORE MORE EFFICIENT IN

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.678
CREATING. A GREEN TECHNOLOGY

01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:24.347
KNOWN SAN JOSE WE HAD DIED AND

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:25.681
WILL DIE JESTERS WHAT HAVE YOU

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.950
WHICH A- MIXED RESULTS. IN TERMS

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:31.454
OF THE- THE BUILDING TO CREATE-

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.256
HYDROGEN BUT AGAIN EVEN THAT

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.357
TECHNOLOGY IS DRASTICALLY

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:36.359
IMPROVING WE SEE GREAT ADVANCES.

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:37.693
IN GERMANY AND OTHER PLACES WITH

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.097
THAT AND SO I LOOK FORWARD. TO

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.666
I'M KIND OF CONTINUAL. CHECK INS

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:46.235
REPORT BACKS ON HOW WE CAN IT

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.804
REALLY ADVANCE. THE

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.705
DISSEMINATION OF THE OF GREEN

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:54.644
HYDROGEN. AS OUR NUMBER ONE

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:55.545
FOCUS THANK YOU. THANK YOU

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:59.415
SUMMER FONG. I THANK YOU CHAIR

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.884
STAFF WERE- FOR HAVING THIS I

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.820
JUST WANTED TO MAYBE THIS

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.823
QUESTION IS- FIRST YOU- AT THE

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:11.194
CDC- IN TERMS OF. WHAT PROJECTS

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.663
ARE IN THE WORKS WHEN IT COMES

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:15.898
TO YOU- SCALING UP HYDROGEN

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.067
PRODUCTION WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.636
BEING PLANNED AND WHAT WHAT ARE

01:02:20.703 --> 01:02:22.605
THE METRICS MOVING FORWARD.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.773
MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE CARP TO AND

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.242
I GUESS THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.910
THAT THE THAT QUESTION TO BOTH.

01:02:27.977 --> 01:02:29.812
THANK YOU SENTIMENTS SO. THE

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.915
NUMBER OF- MEASURES. WE'RE DOING

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:39.655
THROUGH THE- EPIC. PROGRAM

01:02:39.722 --> 01:02:41.757
YOU KNOW IT IN TERMS OF ITS

01:02:41.824 --> 01:02:42.892
APPLICATIONS AND SO FORTH. I'M

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.962
NOT I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE- THE

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.930
TOP OF. ITEM ON THE LIST OF.

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:51.467
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION- PROJECTS I

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:53.402
DON'T I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE-

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.138
STE. YEAH ALL RIGHT OFFER IN

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.873
ADDITION TO MEMBERS WE'VE HAD A

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:57.507
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS IN

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:00.076
THIS SPACE. WHICH WE'RE HAPPY

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:02.111
BEING YET SHARE FURTHER BUT IN

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:03.045
ESSENCE WE'VE LOOKED AT

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.915
DIFFERENT SORTS OF WAYS AND TO

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.417
TEST OUT THE USE OF FUEL CELL

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:10.052
VEHICLES- THROUGHOUT THIS

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:13.723
INCLUDES FUNDING- IN BUSES

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:15.758
TRUCKS REYES SHUCKS IMPORTS AND

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.627
LYFT. AND WE'VE SEEN YOUR

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:18.594
DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN FUELING

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.029
STATIONS THE CONTESTANTS AND

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:21.931
HEAVY DUTY USES ESPECIALLY I'M

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:23.666
REDUCING POLLUTION AND

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:25.535
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO A

01:03:25.601 --> 01:03:27.336
LOT OF THE GOALS OF THESE

01:03:27.403 --> 01:03:28.905
PROGRAMS ON THAT YOU'VE HEARD ON

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.506
THE FUEL SIDE IN THE LOW CARBON

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.275
FUEL STANDARD. THE GOAL IS TO

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.943
SEND THIS VERY CLEAR YOU'RE NOT

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.278
PRESCRIPTIVE MESSAGED HELP

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.913
ENSURING THE CARBON INTENSITY

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.881
KEEPS FALLING. BY THE TECHNOLOGY

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.350
DEMONSTRATION SIDE AND THERE IS

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.752
AN EFFORT TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.620
WORKS IN VARIOUS DEMOS IN

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:46.055
VARIOUS CONTEXTS WHICH ARE

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:48.057
SHOWING US THAT IS REALLY STRONG

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:49.792
AND YOU'LL HEAR AND I THINK WHEN

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.093
POTENTIAL AND HIGHLIGHT. IT'S

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:53.262
REALLY STRONG POTENTIAL IN HEAVY

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.264
DUTY VEHICLE IMPORT USES HIS

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:56.632
GIVEN THAT SO MANY OF THE

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:57.800
STRANGELY AT SIX BUT WAS

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:59.468
COMMUNITIES TO SO MUCH CUSHION

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:00.870
SO IT'S EXCITING TO SEE LET'S

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:03.372
BEGIN WITH A COCKER. CERTAINLY I

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.274
CERTAINLY- WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.510
RENEWABLES I'M I'M SURELY TECH

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.213
AGNOSTIC I GUESS THE QUESTION

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.514
MAYBE S WITH IN A DIFFERENT

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.482
WAY- SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:15.351
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- IN

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.754
THE IN THE IN HIS BUT BUDGET

01:04:18.821 --> 01:04:19.555
PROPOSAL- WHAT WOULD THAT MONEY

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:25.728
BE SPENT ON. AND WHAT PROJECTS

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.463
WOULD BE FUNDED. SO THE ARE

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:28.764
GENERALLY CAN. FOR PROJECTS S I

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:31.767
CAN'T SAY SIX SIX WHAT. IN A-

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:32.668
BUT I WOULD SET THE UP CHEN

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:33.502
SPEAKING. IS THERE IS A

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.071
EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS TO

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:35.905
DEVELOP THE CRITERIA. FOR

01:04:35.972 --> 01:04:37.540
PROJECTS SO AND HE'S VERY BY

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.609
PROGRAM I KNOW I LOOTED FOR

01:04:39.675 --> 01:04:40.643
INSTANCE TO THE H. V. I. P.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.745
PROGRAM WHICH ARE VOUCHERS- IN

01:04:42.812 --> 01:04:44.447
THAT CASE YOU'RE JST COMING TO

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.982
LEICESTER FUNDS TO YOU KNOW.

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:48.651
PURCHASE A VEHICLE- IN OTHER

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.486
CASES ESPECIALLY IN CASES OF

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.121
PILOT PROJECTS WHAT WE TRY TO

01:04:52.188 --> 01:04:53.889
DO. IS DEVELOP CRITERIA FOR WHAT

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.224
WE WANT TO SEE DEMONSTRATED

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:56.425
WHETHER FOR INSTANCE SAY IT'S A

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.827
BETTER APPROACH DEAD REYES TRUCK

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.996
REFUELING. OR HELPING TRANSIT

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:01.430
AGENCIES MOVE FORWARD AND WE ASK

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:03.532
FOR COMPETITIVE BIDS SO REALLY

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:05.334
TRY TO CREATE. AN IN

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:07.169
COLLABORATION WITH THE PUBLIC

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:07.837
AND THROUGH THESE PUBLIC PROCESS

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.639
THESE. PATHS THROUGH WHICH WE

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.940
CAN LEARN ARE COMMERCIALIZED

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:11.841
ACKNOWLEDGES AND THAT AS

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:13.075
TECHNOLOGIES BECOME MORE

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:15.011
COMMERCIAL. THE TENDER GRADUATE

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:15.911
FROM THIS BEACH HEADS INTO

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:17.380
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS WHERE WE CAN

01:05:17.446 --> 01:05:19.148
ACT YOU KNOW FOLKS EQUITIES

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:22.151
SCALE. AND I LASTLY I NOTICED

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:22.652
ONE OF THE REAL FOCUSES

01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:23.886
THROUGHOUT THOSE MORE SCALE

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:25.288
PROGRAM. THAT MAKING SURE WE'RE

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.089
TAKING CARE NOT JUST ABOUT BIG

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:28.291
FLEETS BUT A SMALL FLEET SO

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.192
MAKING SURE THAT THEY CAN

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:31.761
ACCESS. THIS TECHNOLOGY TO JUST

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:33.029
GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF THAT

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.564
KANEMI. OKAY SO YOU. JUST ADDED

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.533
THAT SO WE TYPICALLY TRY TO LIKE

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.469
LEVEL SET OR WHERE PROCESS ISN'T

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.405
ON THE GRANTS ARE FOCUSED ON.

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:46.108
WHAT IS THE MOST PRAGMATIC WAY

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:48.077
TO LOWER THE COST OF FOR.

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:49.078
EXAMPLE FOR ELECTROLYTIC

01:05:49.145 --> 01:05:50.780
HYDROGEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.682
EXACTLY WHAT PROCESSES YOUR

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.517
BOOK. THE MOST PROMISE AND THEN

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:55.818
EVERYTHING YOU WORKSHOPS%

01:05:55.885 --> 01:05:57.320
EVERYTHING SO WE DON'T TAKE

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:59.422
ACTION ON DESIGN PROGRAM UNTIL.

01:05:59.488 --> 01:06:01.891
WE'VE GOTTEN STAKEHOLDER INPUT-

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:08.197
IT'S A GREAT. BUT NOW WE CRAFTED

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:09.665
FROM THAT. OKAY SO TERMS OF

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.734
METRIC- AND YOU MENTIONED THAT A

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:14.036
NUMBER OF THE GRANTS THAT YOU'RE

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.004
DEVELOPING M. IS TO ENCOURAGE

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.440
THE PURCHASE OF A OF A RENEWABLE

01:06:17.506 --> 01:06:20.009
HYDROGEN VEHICLES SO- ANYWAY AND

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:21.510
I THINK YOU MENTIONED A METRIC

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.612
WHERE YOU WE WENT FROM THIRTY

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.214
FIVE HUNDRED- GASOLINE

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:29.118
EQUIVALENT- PRIVILEGED TO NOW

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:31.620
ONE POINT THREE MILLION- SO HOW

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:33.889
MANY L. HYDROGEN VEHICLES OR HOW

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.324
TO IF YOU SELL VEHICLES ARE ON

01:06:35.391 --> 01:06:37.827
THE ROAD RIGHT NOW AND HOW IS

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.128
THAT GROWING OVER TIME. SAYS

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.429
GRAHAM CONSIDERABLY IT'S REALLY

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.398
TAKEN OFF MY DUTY I THINK THAT

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:43.566
THERE ABOUT NINETY SIX HUNDRED

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:44.800
VEHICLES WE FUNDED THROUGH

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.002
RECEIVE YOUR P. IN TERMS OF

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:48.571
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THERE A

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:49.839
LITTLE BIT FURTHER BEHIND THE

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.907
CURVE. SO I'M AWARE FOR INSTANCE

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:52.842
ABOUT THIRTY DRAYAGE TRUCKS WE

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.344
FUNDED WITHIN TRANSIENT OTHER

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.179
THIRTY SIX TRUCKS IN TECHNOLOGY

01:06:57.246 --> 01:06:58.013
DEMONSTRATION LAXER TALKING TENS

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.548
OF VEHICLES. BUT THEY'RE REALLY

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:01.584
IMPORTANT STARTING POINTS THAT

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:02.551
SERVE TRACKS ABOUT THE

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:03.686
CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.988
EARLIER EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:09.358
THE COMES TO CONSUMER PURCHASES.

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.326
YOU'RE TALKING IT OUT. AT

01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:11.927
TECHNOLOGY A GNOSTIC PROGRAM

01:07:11.994 --> 01:07:12.795
WHERE CONSUMERS ARE DRIVING THE

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.264
CHOICE. AND HENCE YOU KNOW THESE

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:17.333
OVER TEN THOUSAND. I THINK SOME

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.467
OF MY STAFFERS AND AROUND TWELVE

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.269
THOUSAND. VEHICLES IN CONSUMER

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:23.239
PROGRAMS VERSUS AND BEGINNING TO

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:26.108
SEE A FUEL CELL VEHICLE ROLLOUTS

01:07:26.175 --> 01:07:28.744
AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. IS YOUR AT

01:07:28.811 --> 01:07:30.546
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THAT FOR

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:32.648
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE THE

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:35.117
EMPHASIS IS WHICH- I GUESS THAT

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:37.086
WAS AS MORE THAN HIS BEEN ON

01:07:37.153 --> 01:07:38.888
LIGHT DUTY AND THAT'S WHY

01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:39.722
THERE'S BEEN MORE VERSES HEAVY

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:43.225
DUTY OR- HOW DO YOU- I GUESS HOW

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.161
DO YOU ASSESS AS SHOULD WE BE

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:46.996
FOCUSING ON HEAVY DUTY OR SHOULD

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:49.698
WE- PRIORITIZE. OUR DO YOU- HOW

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.867
DO YOU LOOK AT THEM. WELL I

01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:53.102
THINK THIS IS A TECH DEVELOPMENT

01:07:53.169 --> 01:07:54.804
CURVE STORY YOU KNOW LIKE THE

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:55.638
VEHICLES AND GENERALLY BAN

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.373
SOMEONE AHEAD OF THE CURVE IN

01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.674
TERMS OF ITS ZERO EMISSION

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.209
VEHICLES GENERALLY AND THAT'S

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:00.943
TRUE FOR BOTH BATTERY AND FUEL

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.045
CELL- AND THAT'S RAPIDLY

01:08:03.112 --> 01:08:04.413
BEGINNING TO CHANGE IN PART

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:05.581
THROUGH. STATE INVESTMENT

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:08.150
DOLLARS SO YOU KNOW IT WILL STAY

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:09.652
TRUE AND AT LEAST IN A CURRENT

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:11.554
STATUS THE LIKE TO THE PROGRAMS

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:13.355
THOSE THEIR FUEL NEUTRAL. AT AT

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.024
HOLDEN AND WE CAN FOLLOW THAT

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:16.692
CHOICE WHICH I THINKMAKES SENSE

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.528
AS WE SEE REGULATORY WRAP UP TO

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:21.730
A 100% IMPORT TO STAY FLEXIBLE.

01:08:21.797 --> 01:08:23.732
AND HEAVY DUTY. THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:08:23.799 --> 01:08:25.167
IS RAPIDLY DEVELOPING YEAH WE

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:26.869
REALLY SIZE BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:08:26.936 --> 01:08:28.537
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES START TO

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:29.438
TAKE OFF WILL BEGIN TO SEE THE

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.640
SAME THING THE FUEL CELL. AND WE

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.375
THINK ABOUT GETTING ALL THE WAY

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.543
TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION PORTED TO

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:36.045
STAY SOMEWHAT FLEXIBLE GIVEN

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:37.713
THESE DIFFERENT USE CASES ONE

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.348
THING I WOULD SAY OVERALL THOUGH

01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:41.484
IN THIS IS I THINK PART OF THE

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.985
OVERALL BUDGET PROPOSAL THIS

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.086
YEAR. A STRONG FOCUS IN HEAVY

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.888
DUTY IS QUITE IMPORTANT THERE

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.990
FEWER OVERALL VEHICLES WHICH IS

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.159
ONE REASON THE NUMBERS WIND UP A

01:08:50.226 --> 01:08:50.693
BIT LOWER. THEY'RE REALLY

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.828
PLEADING VEHICLES IN THE TEND TO

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.063
EXPOSE ON EACH A COMMUNITIES

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:56.165
PARTICULARLY ACUTELY IT'S ALSO A

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:57.399
PLACE WHERE FOR DRIVE TECHNOLOGY

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.535
DEVELOPMENT WE SEE IT SPREAD.

01:08:59.602 --> 01:09:00.402
INTO LIGHT DUTY IN BACK AND

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:02.471
FORTH SO I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING

01:09:02.538 --> 01:09:04.507
HERE IS THE SORT OF PORTFOLIO

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.008
APPROACH REALLY SPEAKS TO

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.776
SEVERAL THINGS IT SPEAKS TO

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.712
RELATIVE VOLUMES OF VEHICLES IN

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:11.614
THE MARKET. IT SPEAKS TO WEAR

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.315
TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE CURRENT.

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:14.783
IN SPEAKS TO THE NEED AT LEAST

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.520
IN MY VIEW- TO HAVE PROGRAMS

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:20.523
THAT CAN FIND. OUT AT DIFFERENT

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:21.624
POINTS ON THAT CURVE SOME

01:09:21.690 --> 01:09:22.791
PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.560
COMMERCIALISE TECHNOLOGIES SOME

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:30.733
THAT ARE FOCUSED. SPECIFICALLY

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:32.034
ON EQUITY NEEDS OUR SMALL FLEET

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.369
NEEDS. AND SOME THAT ARE

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.436
DRIVING. DEVELOPMENT ONE THING

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.437
THAT IS REALLY STRIKE ME ABOUT.

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:36.939
PROGRAMMING GENERAL. YOU DO SEE

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.541
THAT SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE BETWEEN

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:39.108
THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. AND

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.242
REGULATORY PROGRAMS SUCH THAT

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.511
EACH OF THESE CADRES. YOU SEE

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.779
TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING FROM

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.748
INITIAL BEACH HAD ALL THE WAY TO

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.049
MARKET. AND PART OF WHAT WE HOPE

01:09:47.116 --> 01:09:49.451
TO DO AND WHICH WE REALLY VALUE-

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:52.221
AND- YET. GUIDANCE FROM IN THESE

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.590
COMMITTEES FROM THE PUBLIC- IS

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.992
YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:58.727
BALANCE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO- BE

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.830
PRESENT FOR ALL PARTS OF THAT

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:04.066
TRANSFORMATION. SO IN TERMS OF-

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:07.503
SCALING UP- DO YOU HAVE INTERNAL

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:09.004
METRICS WERE WITH ORACLE

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.639
POLITICAL GOAL POSTS WHERE YOU

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.942
YOU WANT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF AYE

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:14.476
CHEN VEHICLES. YOU KNOW EACH

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.979
YEAR BEING SOLD OR OVER DUBBED

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:20.783
BY A WINDOW I MEAN DO YOU GET

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.351
DOWN TO THAT THAT LEVEL OR- ARE

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.420
YOU JUST TRYING TO JUST GET MORE

01:10:24.486 --> 01:10:25.454
PEOPLE TO BUY ARJUN VEHICLES.

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.156
WHAT WILL WE DO TRACK PRETTY

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.725
CLOSELY ACTUALLY- IN CONTRACTING

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.026
WITH VARIOUS PARTS OF FROM THE

01:10:31.093 --> 01:10:32.728
CALIFORNIA FIRST YOU SYSTEM TO

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.863
TRACK. YOUR PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:35.831
ACROSS ALL THESE INCENTIVE

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.366
PROGRAMS AND THE METRICS TO

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.001
TRACK VERY LITTLE BIT BY PROGRAM

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.302
I MEAN FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.071
FOCUSED ON A PILOT PROJECT. YOU

01:10:42.137 --> 01:10:43.105
MIGHT BE LESS INTERESTED IN

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:44.239
TOTAL VOLUME I'M MORE INTERESTED

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:45.774
IN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.142
KNOWLEDGE IS PRODUCED AND

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.011
EXPERIENCE OF THE USERS. WHICH

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:50.346
FOR SOME THE OTHER PROGRAMS WERE

01:10:50.412 --> 01:10:52.014
REALLY INTERESTING UNDERSTANDING

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.682
NOT JUST VEHICLE VOLUME AND

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.084
WE'RE INTERESTED AGAIN IN ALL

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.952
KINDS OF THEIR MISSION VEHICLES

01:10:57.019 --> 01:10:57.786
IN ITS GETTING OUT OF COMPASSION

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.455
THAT MATTERS. OF COURSE WE ALSO

01:10:59.521 --> 01:11:01.090
TRY TO TRACK WHICH SORTS OF

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.358
TECHNOLOGIES ARE TAKING OFF FROM

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.826
A USER EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN SO

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.027
THESE YOU KNOW INVOLVES TRYING

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.629
TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FROM

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:07.963
HOW PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.365
REAL ABILITY THE CHARGING

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.800
NETWORK- TO- YOU KNOW THE

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:13.369
EXPERIENCE OF THE VEHICLE AND

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:14.870
HOW THAT SCALES BETWEEN FOLKS IN

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.639
DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS CLASSES

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.973
ECCENTRICITY LET DIFFERENT

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.508
METRICS THE GOING TO THAT'S AND

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.510
WE TRY TO KEEP LEARNING I KNOW

01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:22.411
THAT'S A- BIG PICTURE ANSWER

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:23.679
SURE THAT'S IN PART BECAUSE

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:25.147
THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:25.748
PIECES. NO I'VE I APPRECIATE

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.750
THAT- ENTER ENTER IN TERMS OF

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.885
SCALING UP HYDROGEN PRODUCTION

01:11:29.952 --> 01:11:31.186
HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:37.660
LOOK- MOVING FORWARD. FOR THE

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:40.329
FUTURE- I. TELL GO I CAN. TO

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:42.665
SOME OF THE- MY STAFF JUST AS-

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:45.300
PER SO WE- SET. MILLION IN OUR

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:46.669
TRANSPORTATION PROBE INTO

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:48.804
HUNDRED PRODUCTION FAR THIS TO.

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.739
PLANTS EXPECTED TO COME ONLINE.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.474
BY NEXT YEAR AND THEN THE NOPE

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:53.575
IT JUST WENT UP FOR THREE MORE

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.245
WHICH WILL BE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN

01:11:56.311 --> 01:11:58.614
PRODUCTION PLANTS. OKAY THEN

01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:00.482
THAT'S SO THAT'S IN THE IN NEXT

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.084
TWO THREE YEARS YOU YOU EXPECT

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.819
EXPECT FOR AT FIVE FIVE FIVE

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.421
PLANNED TO GIVE TO RIGHT NOW AND

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.256
THREE IN THE WORKS. CORRECT AND

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.357
THEN JUST TO YOUR EARLIER

01:12:08.424 --> 01:12:10.559
QUESTION DOES NOT KNOWLEDGE THIS

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:14.096
GOAL ON. FUEL CELL VEHICLES THE

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.632
GOVERNOR'S CALL YOU DON'T GET A

01:12:16.699 --> 01:12:19.301
FIVE MILLION- THESE ARE ZERO

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.203
EMISSION VEHICLE SAY COMPASS.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.539
ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL BUT AGAIN

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:28.343
AS CREEK. POINTED OUT WE HAVE

01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.244
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. ALSO

01:12:29.311 --> 01:12:30.913
VEHICLES THE IN THE ELECTRIC IS

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:33.148
WE'RE AT TODAY. OKAY NO I MEAN

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:35.484
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A- YOU

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:36.919
MADE A LOT OF TIMES I THINK. YOU

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.554
KNOW WE HEAR THE NOMINAL NUMBERS

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:41.490
I GUESS FOR MYSELF I WILL SAY

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:43.425
THAT THE GOAL I WAS JUST KIND OF

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.693
CURIOUS FROM AN AGENCY

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.862
STANDPOINT WHETHER YOU HAVE. YOU

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.230
KNOW PERCENTAGES OF WILL UP A

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.832
PERCENTAGE OF CARS ON THE ROAD

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.433
THAT YOU WANT TO BE AYE CHEN

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.268
THAT YOU WANT TO HELP ELECTRIC

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.571
THAT YOU WANT TO BE- WHATEVER

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.706
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S THERE. SO I

01:12:57.773 --> 01:13:00.843
BRIDGE PUT NOTE. YEAH NO I MEAN

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:02.511
THAT'S REALLY THIS IS WHERE THAT

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:04.513
AT SOME POINT THE MARKET HAS TO

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.614
JUST DECIDE OUR FACILITIES TO

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:08.417
THE- GOALS THAT WE WERE IT'S-

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:10.486
INTERMISSION THOUGH HARD TARGET

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:12.721
THAT WE DO HAVE. TO GET CARDS AS

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.223
THE VEHICLES WE DO THEIR

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:16.158
INFRASTRUCTURE AND A HARD TARGET

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:16.792
THAT WE DO HAVE- THE DIRECTION

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:19.328
WE'RE CALLING. FOR EXECUTIVE

01:13:19.394 --> 01:13:24.266
ORDERS TO GET TO TWO HUNDRED.

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.734
YOU'LL SELL STATIONS. DID

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.402
KNOWLEDGE. WAS ARE GOING TO GO

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.971
AS TO HOW. HYDROGEN FUEL TANK

01:13:29.037 --> 01:13:30.339
PLANTS ARE HOUSING. YOU'LL STILL

01:13:30.405 --> 01:13:32.074
DIGITAL BY TWENTY FIVE CORRECT

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:35.244
AND WE'RE FIFTY FIVE TODAY. YEAH

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:36.945
A PART OF I THINK THE SUCCESS

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.413
WE'VE HAD HONESTY'S BEEN SOME

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.182
LIKE GNOSTIC AS TO THE

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:41.450
TECHNOLOGY TYPE THAT'S NOT

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.485
ALWAYS TRUE I GET A MENTION THIS

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:44.653
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WE'RE

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.320
TRYING TO LEARN AND

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:48.090
COMMERCIALIZE. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:48.891
HELPING FLEET OWNERS MAKE

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:52.027
CHOICES- REALLY WANT N CHOOSING

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.029
BASED UPON THE NEEDS OF THEIR

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.597
FLEET AND THAT ALSO ENCOURAGES I

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.599
THINK MANUFACTURERS DEVELOP AND

01:13:57.666 --> 01:13:59.134
RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES VEHICLE

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.837
TYPES. SO THE HOPE HERE REALLY

01:14:01.904 --> 01:14:02.871
IS FOR THE STATE'S INVESTMENT

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.740
DOLLARS TO DO THE THINGS THE

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.708
PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS CAN'T IN

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:07.342
TERMS OF BOTH CREATING STRONG

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:09.845
REGULATORY SIGNAL AND THEN ON

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:10.345
THE INCENTIVE SIDE. I'M

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.681
PROVIDING FOR THE PRETTY HIGH

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:13.849
DEGREE OF UNCONSTRAINED CHOICE

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:16.485
OR WE CAN THAT RECOGNIZES THAT

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.387
PARTICULARLY CREATING PATHS FOR

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.755
SMALLER OPERATORS SMALLER

01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:21.690
BUSINESSES AND REDUCE EXPOSURE

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:22.691
TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:25.527
FRONTLINE- HAS PARTICULAR VALUE

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.863
TO US- AN- BY LAST QUESTION AND

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:30.165
A CURIOSITY YOU MENTIONED-

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.601
MARKET DYNAMICS WHAT IS. WHAT IS

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.002
THE MARKET TELLING YOU WHAT IS

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:36.405
WHAT ARE CONSUMERS SAYING WHAT

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.740
ARE THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:39.541
RIGHT NOW IS IT IS IT

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:42.311
INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IT THE REBATE

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.513
IS IT I MEAN IS IT A COMBINATION

01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:50.752
OF BOTH IS IT IS WHAT WHAT WHAT. DO YOU SEE RIGHT NOW AND IN

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.821
TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. SO THE

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:53.922
FIRST SAYS PRETTY GOOD NEWS

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.457
UNLIKE YOU DECIDE TO PROP HEARD

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:56.992
THE MILLIONS OF FLORIDIANS

01:14:57.059 --> 01:14:58.293
AVERAGE JUST SOLD AND WE'RE UP

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:58.861
TO LIKE EIGHTY SEVEN. THAT

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:00.863
MODELS AVAILABLE. TO PART OF

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:01.563
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS HELPING

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.664
PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:04.299
REALLY DIFFERENT MARKET THAN

01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:05.901
THEY MAY PERCEIVE IT TO BE FROM

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:07.369
THE TIME THE LAST BY THE

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:08.370
VEHICLE. AND HELPING THEM

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.771
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE ARE

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:10.405
GENERALLY. CHEAPER VEHICLES TO

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:13.675
ROT SO HUGE DEMAND RIGHT FOR-

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:15.310
VEHICLE REBATES YOU KNOW IT'S

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:17.346
LIKE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:18.447
ALMOST SENIOR P. REBATES AND

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:20.449
GONE OUT CLEAN CARS FOR ALL IS

01:15:20.515 --> 01:15:22.651
GOING UP. WE DO SEE A LOT THERE

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:23.952
AND SIMILARLY HUGE DEMAND. IN

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:26.221
BOTH H. FIFTEEN CORE PROGRAMS

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:27.522
FOR THESE VEHICLES AND PEOPLE

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:28.657
LOVE THEM YOU KNOW WHEN THE

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.325
DRIVER. SO THAT'S BAD AT LEAST

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:31.560
IS NEVER THE ISSUE THEY DON'T

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:33.929
BREAK DOWN THE LAST LONGER

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.831
ESPECIALLY WITH THESE- CRAZY

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.466
TIMES THEY'RE A LOT CHEAPER TO

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:39.935
FUEL. SO THOSE ARE ALL WINS-

01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:41.136
PEOPLE OF COURSE I WAS A

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.337
QUESTIONS ABOUT RANGE WHICH IS

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:43.906
ALWAYS GOING OUT THERE QUESTIONS

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:45.540
ABOUT FEELING WHICH IS SEIZING

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:49.645
THE WANT TO SPEAK TO BUT THAT'S

01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.346
ALSO EVER EXPANDING. REALLY FEEL

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:52.881
LIKE WERE RIGHT ON THE CUT CARE.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.449
WHERE WE'VE SEEN THIS SORT OF.

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:55.584
MAJOR EXPANSION. MOVING

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:59.221
THOROUGH. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLY

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.456
FORWARD YOU KNOW A LOT OF HOW

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:02.758
WE'VE CALIBRATED THESE PROGRAMS.

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:03.659
IS TO CONTINUE SENDING

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.960
CERTIFICATES STRONG COST SIGNALS

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:07.729
TO IMPROVE THE FUELS. ARMIES HAD

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:08.664
BEEN TRYING TO. CONTINUE TO

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:10.666
BUILD OUT. YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:12.734
INFRASTRUCTURE CC WILL SPEAK TO.

01:16:12.801 --> 01:16:14.269
AND THEN ON THE LIGHT DUTY AND

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.871
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES SIDES.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.940
MAKING SURE THAT THIS CHANGE

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.474
WORKS FOR SMALL FLEETS YOU KNOW

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.510
WORKS FOR EQUITY COMMUNITIES.

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:23.512
AND ALSO THAT THE GOOD NEWS GETS

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:24.446
OUT IS ON THESE HUGE PRIVATE

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:26.315
INVESTMENTS. AND BEGIN TO REALLY

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:29.184
TAKE OFF BY THEM THE FURNITURE

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:30.185
HELP SHIELD ON ANYTHING HE IS

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.420
HERE. I THANK YOU FOR THE

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.854
INFORMATION IF I COULD JUST ASK

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.356
OUT IF YOU COULD GIVE US THE

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:35.824
INFORMATION OF WHERE THOSE

01:16:35.891 --> 01:16:36.658
PLANTS ARE GONNA COME THOSE-

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:37.559
THREE ADDITIONAL ONES I'D-

01:16:37.626 --> 01:16:39.695
APPRECIATE IT. THANKS VERY MUCH

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:40.862
. YEAH WE'LL DO THAT THANK YOU

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:45.467
SEVEN. THANK YOU MISTER LEE.

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.703
THANK YOU CHAIR I HAD HOPED THAT

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:48.236
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WOULD

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.105
EVENTUALLY ASK MY QUESTIONS BUT-

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.773
I HAVE ONE SIMPLE QUESTION

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.643
BEFORE- FOR CC I THINK WOULD BE

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.978
MOST EFFICIENT. WELL FIRST OF

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.713
ALL I'M VERY EXCITED THAT

01:16:57.779 --> 01:16:58.347
POTENTIAL PERHAPS TO HAVE

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.649
ANOTHER A TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE

01:17:00.716 --> 01:17:02.517
WE NEED I THINK ALL OPTIONS ON

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:03.685
THE TABLE HERE. BUT IN A

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.687
DISCUSSION ABOUT GRAY BLUE AND

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.723
GREEN HYDRANT DO WE KNOW RIGHT

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.391
NOW IS A STATE WHAT IS THE BREAK

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.393
UP PERCENTAGE OF HYDROGEN BEING

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.528
PRODUCED IS A MAJORITY ONE

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.998
VERSION OR THE OTHER. YES WE DO

01:17:16.064 --> 01:17:18.734
SO- UNFORTUNATELY GRANT HUNDREDS

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.437
IS ONLY ABOUT 1% OR SO OF THE

01:17:22.504 --> 01:17:24.840
HYDROGEN BEING. PRODUCED IN

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:29.311
CALIFORNIA- AND- YOU KNOW

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:30.712
BECAUSE POINT THE VAST MAJORITY

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:32.848
BUDGET BOTH DOMESTICALLY IN

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:35.884
CALIFORNIA AND GLOBALLY IS- FROM

01:17:35.951 --> 01:17:39.488
FOSSIL FUELS. AND THAT'S JUST A

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:41.656
FUNCTION OF COST I MEAN IT'S

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:44.126
BEEN ON THE MARKET IS VERY IN

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.894
TUNE TO THAT AND AS I MENTIONED.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.562
THE COST IS ROUGHLY TWO DOLLARS

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.898
A KILOGRAM WERE THE GRAY

01:17:49.965 --> 01:17:53.602
HYDROGEN AND IN THE FIVE TO TEN

01:17:53.668 --> 01:18:03.779
NINE DOLLARS FOR A GREEN TODAY.

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.947
ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AM LITERALLY

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:08.683
COLOR BLIND SO I COULDN'T TELL

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:10.886
IF I COULD SEE IT. I WOULD SAY

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.654
THAT- THAT LOW CARBON FUEL

01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:13.455
STANDARD PROGRAM I'VE TALKED

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:15.257
ABOUT BEFORE HELPS THE SEAT THAT

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:16.958
FURTHER SO ONE THING THAT IS ONE

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.260
REEMPHASIZE THAT HAVEN'T

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:21.063
CONTINUED SIGNAL. OUR PRODUCTION

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:21.663
PROTHESIS REDUCE CARBON

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:25.400
INTENSITY. SHOULD HELP TRACKING

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:26.268
PRIVATE INVESTMENTS WHERE WE

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.537
ONCE IN. BUT I STILL BE ABLE TO

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:29.704
TELL WHAT COLOR THEY ARE. I'LL

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:35.477
NEVER BE A FIGHTER PILOT. OKAY

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.447
YOU KNOW I HAD A QUESTION

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:41.583
SIMILAR TO MR LEE'S QUESTION ON

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.385
THE HYDROGEN CLASSIFICATIONS BY

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.188
COLOR I BELIEVE OF THE SPEAKER

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.857
FROM CARB MENTION THAT RIGHT NOW

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:50.992
WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON ANY GOALS

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.261
BY CLASSIFICATION- PRODUCTION

01:18:53.328 --> 01:18:55.597
METHOD. YOU KNOW BUT EACH

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:57.466
HYDROGEN PRODUCTION METHOD HAS A

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:59.935
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:03.805
SO I WAS CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHEN

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.574
DO YOU THINK WE WOULD BE READY.

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.109
OR WHY YOU SAID THAT LIKE RIGHT

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:10.612
NOW THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON

01:19:10.679 --> 01:19:11.613
THE PRODUCTION METHOD OF

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.315
HYDROGEN. WHAT THIS IS AND HOW

01:19:13.381 --> 01:19:14.816
WE THINK ABOUT THE CARBON

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:16.685
INTENSITY OF IT I DON'T WANT FOR

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:17.652
A SECOND TO SUGGEST THAT WE

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:18.687
THINK ABOUT PRODUCTION MANY FEEL

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.822
THAT WE DON'T NEED TO THINK

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:21.389
ABOUT OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:24.059
PIECES OF THE PUZZLE NOT ALL OF

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:24.693
WHICH ARE ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:25.460
SOME ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:27.362
DISTRICTS AND RATHER REGULATORY

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.330
BODIES. IT JUST COMES TO THE

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.465
CARBON INTENSITY PUZZLE THAT'S

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:32.267
ONE WHERE OUR PARTICULAR TOOL

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.136
NOT LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD AND

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.737
SOME OF HER RELATED POLICIES.

01:19:35.804 --> 01:19:37.239
HAPPENS TO REALLY BE FOCUSED ON

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.574
THE PARTICULAR PATHWAYS FOR

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:41.309
PARTICULAR FUEL AND ITS CARBON

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:42.277
INTENSITY. IT JUST MEANS THAT

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:43.278
RATHER THAN USING THESE

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:45.347
HEURISTICS OF COLOR WE CAN TO

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:46.681
REALLY BE FOCUSED ON WHAT'S TRUE

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:48.683
ABOUT THIS PATHWAY WHICH DOES

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.018
HAVE THE BENEFIT OF PROVIDING

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:52.654
THAT I SHARED SIGNAL. IN ACROSS

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:53.989
THAT MARKET TO CONTINUE REDUCING

01:19:54.055 --> 01:19:55.423
INTENSITY REGARDLESS OF HOW IT'S

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.526
PRODUCED BUT AGAIN THAT IS TO

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.227
SAY THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF THE

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:00.729
THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:01.496
INDUSTRIAL AIR POLICY DON'T

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.598
SUGGEST OTHERWISE. JUST HAPPENS

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:08.370
TO BE WITHIN THE SORT OF GHG.

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:12.007
FRAME ON THE TROLLEYS. SO I HAVE

01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:13.608
A I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:15.810
THANK YOU ALL FOR TAKING SO MUCH

01:20:15.877 --> 01:20:17.746
TIME- FIRST AND I THINK THIS IS

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.447
FOR CC BUT EITHER YOU CAN.

01:20:19.514 --> 01:20:22.384
ANSWER IT- GIVEN THAT. THE

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:23.718
INDUSTRY ESTIMATES THAT THE

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.620
POPULATION OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:28.356
VEHICLES WILL BE SIXTY ONE

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:29.658
THOUSAND BY THE END OF TWENTY

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:30.659
TWENTY SEVEN. SHOULD WE BE

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:33.562
SPENDING. THIS MONEY ON HYDROGEN

01:20:33.628 --> 01:20:35.030
INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE WE GETTING

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:36.965
AHEAD OF THE MARKET HERE. WITH

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:38.466
THE FUELING STATIONS ALL ASSET

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:43.171
TO CC. SO THAT IS THE CHOICES

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:44.573
ABOUT BECAUSE WE ARE

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:47.509
IMPLEMENTING. AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:49.678
THAT THAT SETS THE TWO HUNDRED

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.346
STATION GOAL AND THAT'S THE

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:53.882
MESSAGE AND SO WE ARE AND IN

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:56.284
FACT EIGHTY EIGHT HAD DIRECTED

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:59.688
AT THAT CARVED OUT. OF YOU KNOW

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:01.323
PORTION OF OUR FUNDS FOR FUEL

01:21:01.389 --> 01:21:02.791
CELLS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:06.261
REALLY IS A STEP BY THE GOVERNOR

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:07.729
AND THE LEGISLATURE. ITHINK AT

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:08.663
THE END OF THE DAY YOU KNOW

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.299
THERE ARE. GOING TO BE-

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:14.202
EVOLUTIONS IN THE MARKET WHERE-

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:18.640
YOU KNOW. WALDRON EACH FOR FOUR

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:19.774
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY CALPERS

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:22.978
BECOMES REALLY CLEAR- I WOULD

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.180
SAY TEN YEARS AGO WAS NOT CLEAR

01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:26.881
AT ALL WITH THE FUTURE PASSENGER

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.351
VEHICLES. WAS GONNA LOOK WORK-

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:32.487
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BEEN-

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.122
OVERWHELMINGLY TRENDING TOWARDS

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.391
HIS I THINK. YOU KNOW SIMILARLY

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:38.159
WITH WITH HYDROGEN YOU KNOW

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.394
LOOKING AT OTHER THESE OTHER

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:40.829
NATIONS AND THEIR STUFF IT'S

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:43.164
REALLY HARD TO ELECTRIFY- THAT

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.267
I'M TAKING YOU KNOW SB NATION-

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.135
CERTAINLY LONG HAUL AVIATION.

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:50.672
ELEMENTS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:53.208
RAIL LOCATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL

01:21:53.275 --> 01:21:56.044
POWER SECTOR- WHERE WE CAN

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.846
REALLY SEE. AN ISSUE BUT YOU

01:21:57.912 --> 01:21:58.680
KNOW THIS POINT WE ARE

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.548
IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE THAT WAS

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:03.251
GIVEN TO US SOME YEARS AGO

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:10.492
BURKE. GOING TO- STAY ON COURSE. UNTIL WE GET TO TWO HUNDRED.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:12.294
LET ME ASK YOU MENTION THE

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.695
CARBON. ROAD MAP THAT YEAH DOES

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.462
THAT DOCUMENT. HOW YOU SITE

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:17.232
THESE STATIONS AND WHAT IS THE

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:18.767
STRATEGY AS TO WHERE YOU'RE

01:22:18.833 --> 01:22:21.436
PUTTING THEM ARE YOU LOOKING AT

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:22.837
FOR INSTANCE THE DIFFERENT TYPES

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:25.407
OF VEHICLE CLASSES AND- HOW DO

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.709
YOU MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.710
WHERE THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.745
GOING TO GO. YES THAT'S ALSO

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:32.314
THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS YOU ARE

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.515
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WE

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:34.949
TAKE A LOT OF FEEDBACK AND

01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.584
TRYING TO LOOK COMPREHENSIVELY.

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.386
I DO THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.355
PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE HEAVY

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.691
DUTY SECTOR NOW- HENRYSON MORE

01:22:42.757 --> 01:22:43.958
WHO SHOULD BE GIVING THIS

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.493
PRESENTATION BUT ISN'T BECAUSE

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.262
HE'S VISITING US. IS A BIG TOUR

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.698
OF LITHIUM VALLEY- TODAY IS MUCH

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:52.367
MORE ABOUT- UP TO SPEED AS HE

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:54.602
RUNS ARE. I CAN TRANSPORTATION

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:55.337
PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:58.473
COMMISSION- BUT THAT'S THAT'S

01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:00.342
ALSO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS

01:23:00.408 --> 01:23:01.009
THE HYDROGEN. ROADMAP THAT

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:03.478
ATTENTION IS MORE ROAD MAP FOR

01:23:03.545 --> 01:23:07.182
OUR RESEARCH INVESTMENTS THROUGH

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.249
THE EPIC PROGRAM. WE'RE GOING TO

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:09.751
THE CONTRACT- IN THE COMING

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.720
MONTHS HOW TO REALLY GET VERY

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:14.255
GRANULAR WAY DOWN TO THE DETAIL

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.624
EXACTLY WHERE. THE BEST

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:17.525
INVESTMENT OF OUR HYDROGEN

01:23:17.592 --> 01:23:19.427
RESEARCH MONEY. NEEDS TO GO TO

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.030
FIGURE OUT THE BEST ONE MILLION

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.598
SPECIFICALLY. FIVE HUNDRED

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:30.105
RESEARCH. THANK YOU- ARE YOU

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:32.707
TALKING TO THE AG INDUSTRY ABOUT

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.075
HYDROGEN APPLICATIONS IN

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:38.046
AGRICULTURE IN TERMS OF-

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:38.947
AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES FOR

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:40.915
INSTANCE JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.550
AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE WHEN I

01:23:42.617 --> 01:23:44.319
WAS YOU KNOW HOW BECAUSE I DID

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:45.887
SEE A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:46.755
AGRICULTURAL HYDROGEN VEHICLES

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:47.956
WHICH WAS PRETTY EXCITING YOU

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:49.691
KNOW AND GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:52.127
ELECTRIFYING VEHICLES THAT ARE

01:23:52.193 --> 01:23:53.762
YOU KNOW HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.963
OF ACRES IN DIFFERENT PLACES ALL

01:23:55.029 --> 01:23:56.698
THE TIME I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:57.866
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

01:23:57.932 --> 01:23:59.868
POTENTIAL FOR HYDROGEN FUEL. AS

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:02.003
AS AS AS ZERO EMISSION FUELING

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.670
FOR THESE VEHICLES WHETHER

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:03.772
YOU'RE THINKING AT ALL ABOUT

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.240
WHAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE IF

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:14.616
ANYTHING THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. SO I HAVE NOT MYSELF TALK TO

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:18.486
ANYONE. OUR CULTURE INTO A

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:19.921
HYDROGEN. VEHICLES TO

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:22.490
APPLICATIONS I HAVE VISITED MARC

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.526
IS ELECT TRACTOR COMPANY THAT'S

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:27.829
NOW AND LEARN MORE- LARGEST

01:24:27.896 --> 01:24:29.531
ELECTRIC CHARGING COMPANY

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:31.933
RESIDENT THEY'RE SELLING OF MID

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.003
SIZED TRACTORS- I I'M SURE THERE

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:37.772
ARE SOME AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT-

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.474
BURKE YOU ALSO BUT I'M NOT. I

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:41.810
DON'T KNOW CRAIG ARE YOU- YOU

01:24:41.876 --> 01:24:43.578
ENGAGED IN THAT SPACE YOU KNOW

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:45.480
SOMEONE AND I GUESS WHAT I'D SAY

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.148
THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:49.851
A PARTICULAR- FUEL CELL USES AND

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:51.453
TRACTORS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:52.987
THAT COULDN'T BE A THING AND AS

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.489
EVER IN EVERY CULTURE THERE SO

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.590
MANY DIFFERENT SPACES THERE

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.192
THINK FOR INSTANCE OF WAREHOUSES

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.461
WHERE FORKLIFTS ARE HUGE DEAL

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:00.428
AND FUEL CELLS ARE GOOD USE

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:02.864
FORM- SIMILARLY THERE MAY BE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.232
OTHER FORMS IN THE APARTMENT

01:25:04.299 --> 01:25:05.333
WHERE THIS MAKES SENSE. ONE

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:06.534
THING THAT'S TRUE IN

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.735
AGRICULTURAL USES YOU KNOW WE

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:09.571
NEED TO BE REALLY THOUGHTFUL

01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:10.672
ABOUT WHICH TECHNOLOGIES GET

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:12.474
INTRODUCED AGENCIES ACKNOWLEDGES

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:13.975
MOVE AND SPREAD INTO THOSE

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:16.478
SPACES SO THIS MADMAN HOPEFUL

01:25:16.544 --> 01:25:18.012
ANSWERS WATCH THIS SPACE AND

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.148
ANYTHING CREATING IN. THIS POOL

01:25:20.215 --> 01:25:22.116
OF PROJECTSAND FUNDS SHOULD

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.618
HELP DRIVE CHANGE THERE TOO

01:25:23.685 --> 01:25:25.787
THANKS I THINK THIS IS FOR CAR

01:25:25.854 --> 01:25:27.522
BUT- HOW IS THE STATE TRACKING

01:25:27.589 --> 01:25:30.291
PROGRESS OR TRENDS IN HYDROGEN

01:25:30.358 --> 01:25:32.494
PRODUCTION AND ITS IMPACT ON AIR

01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:34.262
QUALITY AND POLLUTION I KNOW WE

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:35.697
TALKED ABOUT EMISSIONS BUT ARE

01:25:35.763 --> 01:25:38.066
YOU ALSO LOOKING AT THE IMPACT

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:39.734
ON YOUR QUALITY AND KNOCKS AND

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.469
OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTION'S WOULD

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:47.809
OCCUR JUST. WITH REGARD TO

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:48.943
HYDROGEN SPECIFICALLY. SO I'M

01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:50.712
CERTAINLY ARE A GET ON THE WAY

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:51.746

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:12.126
MOST IMPORTANT THING RIGHT NOW

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.895
IN THIS SPACE IS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:15.930
GET FEDERAL MONEY INTO

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:16.965
CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.900
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL RIGHT. I DO

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:21.202
THINK IT BE HELPFUL FOR. PERHAPS

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:23.104
YOUR TO COMMITTEES TOOK TO

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:25.807
CONVENE- THE STAKEHOLDERS AGAIN-

01:27:25.873 --> 01:27:28.576
ON HYDROGEN TO BETTER COORDINATE

01:27:28.643 --> 01:27:31.045
ON A JOINT CALIFORNIA PROPOSAL I

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:33.815
THINK. WE WILL HAVE A BETTER

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:34.649
CHANCE THAN PROBABLY ANY OTHER

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:38.119
REGION. IN THE COUNTRY TO DIRECT

01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:39.153
THIS MONEY INTELLIGENTLY AND

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:42.824
HELP IT. SUPPORT SERVICE SMART

01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:45.960
DEVOLUTION OF ONCE THIS SECTOR-

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.630
AND SO YOU KNOW BUT IT WOULD BE

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:51.099
A BIG WIN FOR CALIFORNIA TO GET.

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:53.701
A MEANINGFUL HUB IN THIS AREA.

01:27:53.768 --> 01:27:55.670
THANK I'LL JUST HAVE TWO THINGS

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:58.573
I'M IN SPEAKING JUST MYSELF AND

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.774
THAT BALLING YEAH THE FIRST IS

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:02.410
CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR YOU READY

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:03.878
PERMITTING THAT IS HEALTH

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:04.779
PROTECTIVE IN COMMUNITY

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.414
PROTECTION. AND PRODUCTION

01:28:06.481 --> 01:28:07.815
FACILITIES I THINK IS REALLY

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.851
CRITICAL NOT JUST FOR HYDROGEN

01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.853
BUT FOR OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:13.655
BACK BETTER FAST ON A LOT OF

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:14.522
DIFFERENT PARTS OF CLIMATE

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:17.358
POLICY TRYING TO BUILD. NOW OUR

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.193
WAY FORWARD THAT'S REALLY

01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:20.094
CRITICAL AND ANOTHER PIECE HOLDS

01:28:20.161 --> 01:28:21.663
KNOWN AS FOR ESPECIALLY THE

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.464
HEAVY DUTY SPACE ON THREE

01:28:23.531 --> 01:28:24.899
MANAGERS TO LOOK PRETTY FAR

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.535
AHEAD SO THE SORTS OF MULTI YOUR

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.604
PACKAGES LEGISLATURES DECIDED ON

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.439
THE PAST FEW YEARS AND FUNDING.

01:28:31.506 --> 01:28:32.674
I'M HAVING A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.776
AND I THINK REALLY CLEAR STUDY

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:36.844
FINDING ON A STATE PROGRAMS AND

01:28:36.911 --> 01:28:38.680
WHAT FOLKS NOT TO THAT AND NOW

01:28:38.746 --> 01:28:39.781
HOW TO PLAN THEIR FLEETS INTO

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:41.215
ZERO EMISSION WILL HELP

01:28:41.282 --> 01:28:45.086
PROVIDING A GREAT DEAL. OF ROOM

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.254
ON ON BOTH ON. BETTER ELECTRIC

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.955
AND FUEL CELL VEHICLES AND

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:49.490
THANKS FOR ASKING THE QUESTION.

01:28:49.557 --> 01:28:50.758
THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT YOU HAD

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.794
NOT ANOTHER QUESTION OF THANK

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.028
YOU VERY MUCH MA'AM SURE FOR

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.997
LETTING ME COME BACK AND UP JUST

01:28:56.064 --> 01:28:58.199
DOUBLE DUTIES AS QUICK AS I CAN

01:28:58.266 --> 01:28:59.534
ONE I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:02.203
THAT- PROBABLY THE ONLY SILVER

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.172
LINING OF THE TRAGEDY THAT'S

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.773
GOING ON TODAY IN THE WORLD IT'S

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:06.774
RESULTING IN THE HIGHER FUEL

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.376
PRICES IS IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:10.712
ACCELERATE. THE ADOPTION OF

01:29:10.778 --> 01:29:12.780
HOUSE OF TECHNOLOGY OUT THERE

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:16.384
WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE- BOTH-

01:29:16.451 --> 01:29:19.554
THE CC AND CARB- IDENTIFYING

01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.755
THAT THE GOAL IS NOT ANY

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.757
TECHNOLOGY THE GOAL IS TO THE TO

01:29:22.824 --> 01:29:24.692
THE MISSION AND THAT IS TO

01:29:24.759 --> 01:29:26.627
DECREASE THE EMISSIONS OVERALL-

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:28.362
BUT FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.898
MORE NOVICES. COULD YOU PLEASE

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:32.100
AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:34.035
COMES FROM THE FOR THE ENERGY

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:38.239
COMMISSION- AND- CHAIR HARSH GOT

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.007
CHILD- COULD YOU JUST SUMMARIZE

01:29:40.074 --> 01:29:42.110
GIVE US THE ELEVATOR PITCH THE

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:44.812
SIXTY SECOND PITCH AS TO WHY-

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:46.748
HYDROGEN SEEMS TO BE BETTER FOR

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:49.484
HEAVY DUTY- RIGHT NOW. THAT'S

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:51.119
IT'S IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:53.921
TIMES IN THE REPORT HERE- BUT-

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:55.223
COULD COULD YOU COULD YOU

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.892
IDENTIFY THAT OR WHOEVER IS THE

01:29:57.959 --> 01:29:58.960
APPROPRIATE PERSON ANSWER THAT

01:29:59.026 --> 01:30:00.495
QUESTION. YEAH I THINK ONE OF

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.463
THE ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES USES

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:04.132
THE RANGE OF THE VEHICLES ARE

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:06.400
WHICH YOU KNOW FOR HEAVY DUTY

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:07.902
TRUCKING AND SO FORTH. ARE RIGHT

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:11.205
NOW YOU KNOW- THE- ABILITY TO DO

01:30:11.272 --> 01:30:14.075
LONG RANGE. ISN'T THERE FOR EASY

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:15.977
TRUCKING OBVIOUSLY TESLA HAS

01:30:16.043 --> 01:30:18.079
ELECTRIC SEMI IN DEVELOPMENT BUT

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:20.081
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF OTHERS.

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:23.451
THAT ARE LOOKING FOR LONG RANGE-

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.186
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME LIKE MID

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:27.188
RANGE YOUR MOTIVES DURING

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:31.159
ELECTRIC. TRUCK YOU KNOW FOR

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.660
DELIVERY VEHICLES AND SO I'M-

01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:33.995
BUT FOR THE MOST PART I THINK

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:37.665
THE HEAVY DUTY SPACE IS. THE

01:30:37.732 --> 01:30:39.367
AREA WHERE HE IS OUR WEAKEST.

01:30:39.433 --> 01:30:41.402
TODAY AT THIS POINT SO I THINK

01:30:41.469 --> 01:30:43.504
THAT WOULD BE THE- DO THAT WOULD

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:46.374
BE KIND OF. Y. SE FUEL CELLS

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:49.277
ARE. ARE STRONGER IN THAT

01:30:49.343 --> 01:30:52.113
POSITION THAN ON PAST YOUR CALLS

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.215
COULD COULD ANY OF THIS

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.250
COMMUNITY ASIDE SCIENTIST. TALK

01:30:56.317 --> 01:30:57.518
ABOUT JUST FROM A SCIENTIFIC

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.754
STANDPOINT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:01.055
AND HYDROGEN VERSUS THE AMOUNT

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:03.658
OF ENERGY AND THEN THE FUEL CELL

01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.493
BATTERY IS THERE. IS THERE ARE

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.663
AND ENERGY INTENSITY THERE THAT

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:14.669
HELPS WITH THE. HEAVY DUTY. I

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.737
THINK IT'S MORE OF AN DENSE. SO

01:31:16.804 --> 01:31:18.406
YOU'RE ABLE TO GET FUEL. SMALLER

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.208
SPACE- YOU KNOW TERMS OF THE

01:31:20.274 --> 01:31:24.378
BILL TO GO- ALONG RANGE. THAT'S

01:31:24.445 --> 01:31:26.247
YOUR ADVANCE. FROM ANY IT'S PER

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:30.685
THAT MENTIONED. IT'S A- HALF OF

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:33.855
THE- TRICITY- TO DO ELECTRIC

01:31:33.921 --> 01:31:35.723
VEHICLE PER MILE THAN A FUEL

01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:37.291
CELL VEHICLE BUT THE DENSITY OF

01:31:37.358 --> 01:31:39.961
THE HYDROGEN IS IT IS A VALUE.

01:31:40.027 --> 01:31:42.830
FOR AND RENT AND SO FORTH IF WE

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.866
GET INTO JUST RECHARGING TIMES

01:31:44.932 --> 01:31:46.500
EXETER RIGHT THERE THERE'S A

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:47.501
REFERENCE IN THE REPORT THAT

01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:49.337
SAYS A SUBSET OF VEHICLE MARKET

01:31:49.403 --> 01:31:50.771
WILL STILL REQUIRE FREQUENT

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.573
RELATIVELY FAST REFUELLING

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:54.575
PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER VEHICLE

01:31:54.642 --> 01:31:59.113
CLASSES. AND SO- MIGHT AT AND

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:02.316
JUST LIKE TO CHECK AND SEE. I'M

01:32:02.383 --> 01:32:03.818
I AM I UNDERSTAND MY

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:04.886
UNDERSTANDING IS YOU COULD

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.889
REFUEL FASTER WITH HYDROGEN THEN

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:11.158
YOU CAN RECHARGING THE BATTERY-

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:14.295
AND SO THIS IS JUST THIS IS

01:32:14.362 --> 01:32:15.930
THAT'S THE STATISTIC THAT I HAVE

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:17.932
IN MY HEAD AND I JUST LIKE TO

01:32:17.999 --> 01:32:18.699
CONFIRM WHETHER THAT'S ACCURATE

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:21.669
OR NOT. THERE IF YOU PULL IN-

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.537
WITH THAT LET'S TALK ABOUT LIGHT

01:32:23.604 --> 01:32:24.939
DUTY VEHICLES RIGHT NOW JUST TO

01:32:25.006 --> 01:32:27.308
KEEP. COMPARING APPLES TO

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:30.611
APPLES- A LIGHT DUTY EVEY PULLS

01:32:30.678 --> 01:32:33.581
IN TO US TO A STATION- IT'S

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.750
GOING TO TAKE. A SIGNIFICANT

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.652
AMOUNT TIME FORTY MINUTES OR SO

01:32:37.718 --> 01:32:40.588
TO CHARGE UP- WHEREAS A LIGHT

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:42.456
DUTY HYDROGEN CAR PULLING INTO

01:32:42.523 --> 01:32:44.325
THE STATION COULD CHARGE IN

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.927
ABOUT FIVE. MINUTES MY

01:32:45.993 --> 01:32:47.962
UNDERSTANDING IS. THAT THE

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:49.830
REFUELING STATIONS SUBSIDIES

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.299
THAT WE'RE GIVING IS ABOUT ONE

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:52.934
POINT TWO MILLION AS YOU SAID

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.636
FOR HYDROGEN AND ONLY ABOUT A

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.071
HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE E. IS

01:32:57.138 --> 01:32:59.874
FOR THE- HE IS THE- HE TO.

01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:02.610
REGULARLY AND SO BASICALLY A

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:03.844
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN TEN TIMES

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:06.547
AS MUCH. BUT ON A PER VEHICLE

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:09.483
BASIS IF YOU COULD CHARGE TEN

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:12.620
TIMES AS MANY VEHICLES. AT THAT

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:14.789
HYDROGEN STATION AS YOU CAN AT

01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:17.558
THE E. V. STATION DOWN ON JUST A

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.093
JUST STRAIGHT UP PER VEHICLES

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.562
BASIS. THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME IN

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:23.230
TERMS OF THE SUBSIDY BECAUSE YOU

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:25.166
CAN CHARGE TEN TIMES AS MANY

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:26.434
VEHICLES BECAUSE YOU CAN

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.669
CHARGING FASTER AND MIKE AM I.

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.571
IN THE BOOK I THINK THIS IS A

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:32.273
THAT'S A GOOD WAY TO THINK ABOUT

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.507
I MEAN REALLY THE HYDROGEN FUEL

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.909
INFRASTRUCTURE PUTTING ITS MORE

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.811
KNOWLEDGE AS TO A GAS STATION.

01:33:36.877 --> 01:33:38.279
NOW HAVING SAID THAT WHAT'S

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:40.614
HAPPENING IN THE V. CHARGING IS

01:33:40.681 --> 01:33:42.583
WE'RE MOVING TO FASTER FASTER

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:44.418
CHART SO THERE IS A THREE AND A

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:46.687
FIFTY K. W. YOU CHARGER. THAT'S

01:33:46.754 --> 01:33:48.322
THROUGH THE U. L. TESTING RIGHT

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:50.124
NOW AND BEING DEPLOYED WHICH IS

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:51.759
A HUNDRED MILES OF CHARGE IN

01:33:51.826 --> 01:33:52.660
FIVE MINUTES OR TWO HUNDRED

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.762
MILES CHARGING IN TEN MINUTES WE

01:33:54.829 --> 01:33:56.464
JUST FUNDED A PROJECT A TWO

01:33:56.530 --> 01:33:57.565
WEEKS AGO AT THE ENERGY

01:33:57.631 --> 01:34:05.006
COMMISSION. FOR US K. W. BUS

01:34:05.072 --> 01:34:06.007
CHARGER SO THE CHARGING STE IS

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:08.075
ALSO OUR RECORD. INCREASING SO.

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:09.343
WHAT EVEN THOUGH YOU DON'T SEE

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:11.278
THOSE ARE VERY ARE IN THE MARKET

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:12.847
TODAY BUT THAT'S THE DIRECTION

01:34:12.913 --> 01:34:15.049
IT'S GOING TO BE A SUBSET OF.

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:17.985
VERY VERY FAST CHARGING- NO IT'S

01:34:18.052 --> 01:34:19.954
A CHARGER FOR MY WILL BE INS AND

01:34:20.021 --> 01:34:21.455
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:24.692
WILL BE AT. A HIGHER STE IT DOES

01:34:24.759 --> 01:34:26.060
WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE TO PUT IN

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:30.331
THE IN THE- IN THE EAST TO YES.

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:31.832
SO ACTION. FASTER BUT THEY WILL

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.667
COME CLOSER TO THE CHURCH'S SORT

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:36.170
OF LIKE A HYDROGEN IT COSTS- SO

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:37.838
TO GET TO THAT A FAST SPEED YOU

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:43.778
COULD DO THAT- AND THEN- IT. THE

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.513
TWO OTHER THINGS I JUST LIKE TO

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.548
CHECK MY UNDERSTANDING AS TOYOTA

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.884
IS GOING TO HAVE TO DRIVE TRAINS

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.787
FOR FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY READY

01:34:52.853 --> 01:34:54.021
BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:56.957
THREE. IS THAT THE DATA THAT YOU

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:59.860
AND CARP HAVE BECAUSE ONCE THE

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:02.496
ONCE THAT IS SET BY THE END OF

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:03.164
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THAT'S THEIR

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:05.399
GOAL THEN WE WOULD START HAVING.

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:06.967
THE ABILITY TO MORE MASS

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:08.436
PRODUCED AS A QUESTION WAS OUT

01:35:08.502 --> 01:35:10.938
THERE YOU KNOW WE GET WHICH IS

01:35:11.005 --> 01:35:11.572
VERY DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE. RIGHT

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:12.506
NOW THEY'RE BUT THEY'RE MAKING

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.475
HYDROGEN TO HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS BY

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:16.710
HAND VIRTUALLY- BUT THEY WOULD

01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:18.612
BE ABLE TO DO THAT IS THAT IS

01:35:18.679 --> 01:35:20.381
THAT THE DATA THAT YOU DID TO

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:21.549
ANYBODY AND EITHER THE TWO

01:35:21.615 --> 01:35:22.783
DEPARTMENTS HAS FROM TOWARD

01:35:22.850 --> 01:35:24.351
OTHERS. READING ON THE CONSUMER

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:25.553
TIME AT THE PASSENGER VEHICLE

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:27.955
SIDE OF IT SO THERE ARE THREE

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:30.658
COMPANIES THAT- BY THE BY THE

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:31.859
END OF FIVE TWENTY FOUR. ARE

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:34.128
HAVE ANNOUNCED PASSENGER FUEL

01:35:34.195 --> 01:35:35.996
CELL VEHICLES THAT'S TOYOTA AND

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.731
HONDA YEAH YOU HAVE W. AND I'M

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:42.036
SORRY MY QUESTIONS ABOUT HEAVY.

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:42.703
DUTY THESE ARE DRIVE TRAIN

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:44.972
FRONT- YEAH I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:45.873
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THOSE. ADS ON

01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:47.374
PAGES THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WAS

01:35:47.441 --> 01:35:48.909
TOLD BY TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:50.511
SYMPTOM SO MAYBE SOMEBODY HAS AT

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:56.517
AND- MY FINAL. COMMENT IS. BOB I

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.119
THINK IT WAS CRAIG THERE FROM

01:35:58.185 --> 01:36:00.387
CARB MADE THE COMMENT THAT ONE

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:02.656
OF THE THINGS THAT- YOU'VE SEEN

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:03.491
AND I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT I

01:36:03.557 --> 01:36:05.359
HEARD THAT RIGHT IS THAT. ONE OF

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:07.394
THE THINGS THAT CAN THAT THAT

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.396
YOU THINK IS A IS A VERY LIKELY

01:36:09.463 --> 01:36:10.898
POSSIBILITIES AT THEIR- ONCE YOU

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:13.234
START IN THE HEAVY DUTY IF YOU

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.236
FOCUS HYDROGEN ON THE HEAVY DUTY

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:16.604
ONCE YOU START AND HEAVY DUTY.

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:18.105
THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAKE IT

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.840
EASIER TO EXPAND INTO THE LIGHT

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.542
DUTY YOU DID DID I HEAR THAT

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:23.377
CORRECT CRAIG IS THAT WHAT YOU

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.545
WERE IMPLYING A THREE YEAH AND

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:26.814
TO BE CLEAR THAT GOES BOTH WAYS

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.782
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ONES

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:29.517
WHERE. SOLVING THE UNIQUE

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:30.851
PROBLEM IN THAT SPACE CONSCIOUS

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.052
THAT OF ENGINEERING VALUE IT

01:36:32.119 --> 01:36:33.320
HELPS US LEARN THAT HELPS US

01:36:33.387 --> 01:36:35.623
FIGURE OUT NO ARRAY TECHNOLOGY

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.525
OPTIONS SO RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WE

01:36:37.591 --> 01:36:38.759
SEE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:39.793
RECORD EXPERIMENTED IN LIGHT

01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:41.595
DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY. AND HEAVY

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.230
DUTY FOLKS CAN BE FIGURING OUT

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.099
BIGGER MORE POWERFUL VEHICLES IN

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:46.800
A LARGE SCALE ENERGY DELIVERY

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.903
LOTTA USEFUL MUTUAL INTERACTIONS

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:52.606
HEARING BOTH SIDES THANK YOU

01:36:52.673 --> 01:36:54.542
VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

THANK YOU FOR HOSTING THIS

01:36:58.646 --> 01:37:03.984
HEARING- GONNA. PRETEXT THIS

01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:05.819
SOME OF MY BACKGROUND ON ALL OF

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:09.023
THIS- WITH THE ADVENT OF LOSING

01:37:09.089 --> 01:37:10.791
ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE THAT MAKES

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:12.726
ME THE LAST DEPARTMENT OF

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:15.229
ENERGY- LEGISLATIVE ENERGY

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:17.765
HORIZON INSTITUTE GRADUATE LEFT

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:21.569
IN THIS BUILDING- AND BEFORE MY

01:37:21.635 --> 01:37:24.471
TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY- I KNOW A

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:27.141
LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT I'M A

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.409
VETERAN BULLET- THEY A SERVE TEN

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:30.177
YEARS IS A TRANSPORTATION AND

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:32.680
LOGISTICS SERGEANT DEALING WITH

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:35.783
HEAVY DUTY- IN MOVING VEHICLES

01:37:35.849 --> 01:37:38.752
ALL OVER IRAQ AND KUWAIT. THE

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:43.157
PORTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE- SO TO

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.792
ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:46.560
THAT THAT I'VE ACTUALLY ALREADY

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:50.731
HEARD- FRANKLY EUROPE'S ALREADY

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:52.433
MOVED FORWARD ON A LOT OF THIS

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:53.667
ON MY ACCOUNT I HAVE SOME

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.803
CONCERNS NOW HEARING THAT WE'RE

01:37:55.869 --> 01:37:56.537
WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT AT

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.639
TESTING AND PROJECTS VERSES

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:00.574
MOVING FORWARD IN IMPLEMENTING

01:38:00.641 --> 01:38:03.143
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THE

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:04.945
FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE FUEL

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:06.547
STATIONS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO TO

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:10.017
LOOK AT LARGE THIS FLEETS.

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.752
ESPECIALLY IN THE TRANSPORTATION

01:38:11.819 --> 01:38:12.920
FREIGHT AND GOODS MOVEMENT THE

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.288
ENTIRE SYSTEM THE ENTIRE

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.957
NETWORK. IT IS BASED UPON GOING

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.993
IN AND FEELING. IT AND THEN

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:24.965
MOVING FORWARD. AS FAR AS HEAVY

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:26.767
DUTY FLEETS TO MISTER BENNETT'S

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:28.502
QUESTION AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:30.237
HELP I KNOW TOYOTA HYUNDAI

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:32.106
MERCEDES BENZ ARE ALREADY IN

01:38:32.172 --> 01:38:34.174
MASS PRODUCTION OF LARGE. HEAVY

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:38.312
DUTY- THE TRUCKS TO REPLACE THE

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:39.513
EIGHTEEN WHEELERS FOR MOVING

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.248
FREIGHT IN AND THEY'RE ALREADY

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:42.750
DOING THIS IN EUROPE AUSTRALIA

01:38:42.816 --> 01:38:44.251
IN THE ASIAN MARKETS THAT

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:45.753
THEY'RE ALREADY MOVING FORWARD.

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:47.655
YOU THESE GUYS ARE LEAVING US IN

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:51.425
THE DUST. ON WE NEED TO GET

01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:53.427
CAUGHT UP OF THIS IS THE

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:54.962
DIRECTION WE'RE TRULY GOING TO

01:38:55.029 --> 01:38:58.432
GO- MY QUESTION FOR CARVE IN.

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.200
TWO TO THE FOLKS ON THE PANEL.

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.302
WHAT PARTNERSHIPS ARE BEING

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:03.470
BUILT WITH EXISTING FUEL STATION

01:39:03.537 --> 01:39:06.407
COMPANIES LATELY GLOVES AND-

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:07.975
FLYERS IN THESE OTHERS THAT THE

01:39:08.042 --> 01:39:10.477
DEAL WITH THE HEAVY DUTY.

01:39:10.544 --> 01:39:12.613
COMMERCIAL TRUCKING FLEETS

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.214
BECAUSE WHAT A I THINK WE NEED

01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:15.916
TO BE DOING IS LOOKING AT THOSE

01:39:15.983 --> 01:39:16.817
PARTNERSHIPS YORDY HAVE FEEL

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:18.319
STATIONS THAT ARE BUILT. THE WAY

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:21.221
HYDROGEN WORKS IS IT'S NOT A

01:39:21.288 --> 01:39:23.924
CHARGE IT SEES GUYS PULL WHEN

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.893
THEY STICK IT IN THERE AND THEY

01:39:25.959 --> 01:39:28.929
FEEL IT UP AND THEN THEY GO. SO

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:31.332
IF THEY GOT A RUN IN AND GO TO

01:39:31.398 --> 01:39:32.800
THE BATHROOM AND GRAB SOME%

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:33.801
SNACKS MAYBE FIFTEEN TWENTY

01:39:33.867 --> 01:39:34.902
MINUTES. BUT BUT THEY'RE NOT

01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:37.971
STUCK THERE FOR A PROLONGED

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:39.640
PERIOD OF TIME. THAT'S HOW

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:42.142
TRANSPORTATION WORKS. THE ON THE

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:45.479
DAY TO DAY. SO WE SHOULD REALLY

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:46.580
BE LOOKING T PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:48.048
THESE GUYS ALREADY DO THIS

01:39:48.115 --> 01:39:49.750
ALREADY IN BUSINESS THIRTY

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:50.751
MOVING FORWARD BUT I HAVEN'T

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:52.453
HEARD ABOUT WE'RE BUILDING

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:54.755
PARTNERSHIPS WITH EXISTING FUEL

01:39:54.822 --> 01:39:57.658
STATIONS. BECAUSE IN THIS IS

01:39:57.725 --> 01:39:59.259
BEEN TALKED ABOUT ON A

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:01.295
DIFFERENT. SUMMITS AND DIFFERENT

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.197
THINGS IS WE'VE DISCUSSED

01:40:03.263 --> 01:40:05.799
BRINGING HYDROGEN INTO THE MIX.

01:40:05.866 --> 01:40:08.268
IS HOW DO YOU SET UP A PROGRAM

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:11.372
WHERE YOU CAN TELL THE TRUCK

01:40:11.438 --> 01:40:13.440
STOP COMPANY HEY YOU YOU'VE GOT

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:15.809
DIESEL YOU'VE GOT GAS WHAT DOES

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.511
IT TAKE US TO PUT A HYDROGEN

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.480
TANK IN THERE FOR YOU GUYS RUN

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.981
SOME HYDROGEN LINES OUT. WHAT

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:22.683
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SO

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.617
EVENTUALLY WE CAN PUT IN A

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:26.320
HYDROGEN TANKS IN AS WE CURB IN

01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:27.621
GET THE INDUSTRY GOING TO MOVE

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:29.590
FORWARD THEN YOU CAN TAKE OUT

01:40:29.656 --> 01:40:30.891
THE DIESEL D. COMMISSIONER

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.960
WHATEVER WHATEVER POINT WE

01:40:33.026 --> 01:40:36.063
EVENTUALLY GET TO THAT. WE NEED

01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:38.832
TO HEAR THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:39.800
THOSE PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE I

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.069
HAVEN'T HEARD THAT TODAY. IN IF

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.637
THIS IS REALLY WERE GONNA GO THE

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.672
STATE. TO INTEGRATE INTO NEW

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:47.975
TECHNOLOGY THE EV'S IN IN THE

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.744
ELECTRIC IT IT'S GREAT. ON THE

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:53.313
SMALL SCALE FOR DRIVING A CAR

01:40:53.380 --> 01:40:55.816
AROUND A LARGE CITY THAT HAS

01:40:55.883 --> 01:40:59.286
ACCESS TO THIS FOR MY PEOPLE IN

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:01.789
RURAL CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.824
THE CHARGING STATIONS WE'RE

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:05.859
WE'RE GETTING MORE MORE BUT- HE

01:41:05.926 --> 01:41:07.661
IS NOT THERE BUT I THINK OF

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:08.529
WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD ON THE

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:10.364
HEAVY DUTY SIDE WHICH IS WHERE.

01:41:10.431 --> 01:41:12.566
MOST OF THE- HARDER EMISSIONS

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:15.669
ARE COMING FROM IT THAT YOU NEED

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:17.438
TO LOOK AT THE HEAVY DUTY YOU

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.473
NEED TO LOOK AT PARTNERSHIPS AND

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.208
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE ANOTHER

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.743
HEARING WHERE WE BRING IN SOME

01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:23.410
OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TO THE

01:41:23.477 --> 01:41:24.912
CHAIRWOMAN'S QUESTION WITH

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:25.479
AGRICULTURE THEOTHER SOME

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:26.847
SMALLER LIGHTER DUTY THINGS

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:29.516
COMING ON SCALE BUT THE BIG

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:32.319
MASSIVE TRACTORS. THE TECHNOLOGY

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:36.056
IS THERE. I HOST MY JUST REALIZE

01:41:36.123 --> 01:41:38.258
THE WORLD EXPO EVERY YEAR. COME

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.693
DOWN CHECK IT OUT THERE'S A LOT

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.296
OF REALLY NEAT STUFF IN THIS

01:41:42.362 --> 01:41:45.866
REALM. BUT INTEL THE FUEL. IS

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:48.235
THERE I MEAN AS A FARMER COULD

01:41:48.302 --> 01:41:50.270
IF THEY REALLY WANTED TO AND

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:51.705
THIS IS WHERE WE GET TO YOU

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:53.707
KNOW. WHO KNOWS HOW LONG DOWN

01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:55.242
THE ROAD INSTEAD HAVING A DIESEL

01:41:55.309 --> 01:41:57.478
TANK OUT ON THEIR PROPERTY THEY

01:41:57.544 --> 01:41:59.480
CAN HAVE A HYDROGEN TANK. BUT

01:41:59.546 --> 01:42:01.315
WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A STATE TO

COMES OVER THE YELLOW LINE TO

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.594
THE GREEN LINE WHICH IS VIOLATED

01:55:34.661 --> 01:55:37.096
THAT PROVIDES CONNECTION TO.

THE FOCUS IN THAT SUSTAINABILITY

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.555
POLICY SO IT WAS EXCITING TO

01:56:02.622 --> 01:56:04.657
HEAR ALL THE ROBUST DISCUSSION

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:07.193
ON OUR HYDROGEN AND ZERO

SO WITH THAT IN ORDER TO PREPARE

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:39.659
FOR A HYDROGEN RAIL- WE DID NOT

01:56:39.726 --> 01:56:41.661

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.282
GET QUITE STORAGE RAWLING WANTS

01:57:03.349 --> 01:57:05.918
TO BE THE FIRST- PASSENGER RAIL

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:08.621
START UP. WITH ZERO EMISSION

01:57:08.688 --> 01:57:10.623
TECHNOLOGY NOT CONVERT BUT TO

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:15.061
ACTUALLY START UP. THAT WAY AND

01:57:15.128 --> 01:57:16.496
- SO WE'RE LOOKING TO

01:57:16.562 --> 01:57:18.731
INSTRUCTORS I DO CHEN PLANT

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:20.533
AHEAD OF TIME. AND TO DO THAT WE

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:23.669
HAVE PARTNERED WITH OTHER

01:57:23.736 --> 01:57:24.737
TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE TRI

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.439
VALLEY. AND SURROUNDING THIS

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:30.276
LOCATION IS ALSO A LOT OF OUR

01:57:30.343 --> 01:57:32.912
GREAT. AND GOODS MOVEMENT WHAT

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:35.915
TRUCKS YEAH MAINLY THE

01:57:35.982 --> 01:57:37.650
WAREHOUSING THAT'S BEEN ONE OF

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:39.185
THE LARGEST- AREAS OF

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:41.621
CONSTRUCTION IS WHERE HOUSING IN

01:57:41.687 --> 01:57:42.722
THIS AREA SO DON'T BE

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:45.925
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH.

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:47.260
SOME OF THOSE WAREHOUSES THAT

01:57:47.326 --> 01:57:50.863
ARE SEEKING TO YOU. THE HYDROGEN

01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:51.998
POWER FOR TRUCK FOR LONG HAUL

01:57:52.064 --> 01:57:53.533
AND HEAVY DUTY SO THIS IS A

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:55.735
HEAVY DUTY ARM FIVE FACILITY

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:58.571
THAT SCALABLE AND INITIAL SCALE

01:57:58.638 --> 01:58:00.072
WILL BE TO BUILD A HYDROGEN

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:03.810
FACILITY TO START. FEELING

01:58:03.876 --> 01:58:06.279
LOSSES WHAT CONTRA COSTA

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:09.015

TRANSIT AGENCIES IN THE AREA

01:58:19.058 --> 01:58:20.960
THAT. SEEKS TO USE HYDROGEN WE

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:22.361
HAVE HAPPENED A VALUABLE SOURCE

01:58:22.428 --> 01:58:23.463
OF HYDROGEN HELPED FUEL THOSE

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:27.200
BUSES AND THEN ONCE THE RAIL IS

01:58:27.266 --> 01:58:30.269
CONSTRUCTED. AND THAT THE TRAINS

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:33.639
ARE BEING BUILT- NOW SAMBAR DINO

01:58:33.706 --> 01:58:35.441
IS GETTING SOME OF THE FIRST

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:38.678
HYDROGEN TRAINS AND- R. I.

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:39.879
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR SO THOSE WILL

01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:41.581
BE OPERATIONAL BY TIME WE'RE

01:58:41.647 --> 01:58:44.250
FINISHED CONSTRUCTING. THE RAIL

01:58:44.317 --> 01:58:46.486
AND THEN WILL HAVE AVAILABILITY

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:47.753
TO EXPAND THE HYDROGEN FACILITY

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:50.957
BUT MORE TO CONTINUE WITH THE-

01:58:51.023 --> 01:58:52.792

02:04:58.991 --> 02:05:02.061
SOLUTIONS. IT DOES SO AT A COST

02:05:02.127 --> 02:05:03.596
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.464
CAREFULLY INTERROGATE PROPOSALS

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:06.432
FOR BRINGING LARGE SCALE

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:09.335
HYDROGEN PROJECTS FORWARD BEFORE

02:05:09.401 --> 02:05:10.903
COMMITTING TO SUCH A PATH.

02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:12.638
DISCUSSION OF COURSE REQUIRES A

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.506
CAREFUL BALANCE WE SHOULD BE

02:05:14.573 --> 02:05:15.875
FULLY EXPLORING THE SOLUTION

02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:17.509
SPACE WE SHOULD NOT BE

02:05:17.576 --> 02:05:19.478
PRECLUDING POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS.

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.947
THAT SAID. WE'RE ON A TIGHT TIME

02:05:22.014 --> 02:05:23.482
LINE WITH LIMITED BY ITS

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:25.351
INVESTMENT APPLE WHICH MEANS

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:26.685
IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO FULLY

02:05:26.752 --> 02:05:29.221
CONSIDER HOW ANY GIVEN SOLUTION

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:31.557
MIGHT FIT INTO A LONG TERM

02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:33.225
TRANSITION PLAN. WHEN WE

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:35.127
CONSIDER THAT FULLER PICTURE

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:36.862
SOME SOLUTIONS WILL STAY IN THE

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:38.530
RUNNING BUT SOME THINGS JUST

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:40.766
FALL DOWN. AND WHEN IT COMES TO

02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:42.835
HYDROGEN IT'S INCREASINGLY CLEAR

02:05:42.902 --> 02:05:44.069
THAT THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTION

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:45.905
PATHWAYS AND SOME END USE

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:49.108
APPLICATIONS THAT JUST WON'T GET

02:05:49.174 --> 02:05:50.843
THE JOB DONE. SO TO BE ABLE TO

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:51.810
CONSIDER WHETHER AND HOW

02:05:51.877 --> 02:05:53.545
HYDROGEN FITS WITHIN THE ECONOMY

02:05:53.612 --> 02:05:55.547
WIDE TO CARBONIZATION PICTURE.

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:57.249
IT'S WORTH CONSIDERING THREE KEY

02:05:57.316 --> 02:06:00.486
FACTORS PRODUCTION TRANSMISSION

02:06:00.552 --> 02:06:02.521
AND STORAGE AND END USE

02:06:02.588 --> 02:06:04.990
PRIORITIZATION. FIRST WHEN IT

02:06:05.057 --> 02:06:07.092
COMES TO PRODUCTION WE'VE HEARD

02:06:07.159 --> 02:06:08.427
IN SOME OF THESE EARLY PROJECT

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:11.063
PRESENTATIONS CONSIDERATION OF

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:13.766
CARBON INTENSITY. FROM THIS

02:06:13.832 --> 02:06:16.001
REFERS TO THE AMOUNT OF CARBON

02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:18.570
EMISSIONS- HIGH- HYDROGEN

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:21.774
PRODUCED BOB THIS HAS TO INCLUDE

02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.976
UPSTREAM EMISSIONS IT'S CRITICAL

02:06:24.043 --> 02:06:25.511
THAT WE NOT JUST CONSIDERED THE

02:06:25.577 --> 02:06:27.446
POINT OF PRODUCTION. BECAUSE

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:29.281
LETTING IGNORES CRITICAL

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:31.450
INFORMATION THAT CAN GIVE A VERY

02:06:31.517 --> 02:06:34.486
MISLEADING PICTURE OF THE CARBON

02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:35.654
INTENSITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT.

02:06:35.721 --> 02:06:36.855
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.590
JUST CONSIDER CARBON BUT ALSO

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:42.194
COMPLETES. THE TRANSITION TO OUR

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.729
CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE HAS TO BE

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.464
TRULY CLEAN NOT JUST DE

02:06:45.531 --> 02:06:48.033
CARBONIZED. FINALLY WHEN IT

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.768
COMES TO PRODUCTION METHODS IT'S

02:06:49.835 --> 02:06:52.104
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER

02:06:52.171 --> 02:06:53.939
TIGHTENING AND RAMP RATES

02:06:54.006 --> 02:06:56.308
SPECIFICALLY HOW FAST AND TO

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:57.643
WHAT DEGREE CAN BE GIVEN

02:06:57.710 --> 02:07:00.112
PRODUCTION PATHWAYS SKILLED TO

02:07:00.179 --> 02:07:02.481
MEET PROJECTED NEEDS. AND WILL

02:07:02.548 --> 02:07:04.450
THE VARIOUS PERFORMANCE LEVELS

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:06.452
THAT ARE BEING PROJECTED SUCH AS

02:07:06.518 --> 02:07:07.786
THE LEVEL OF CARBON CAPTURE A

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:09.288
BLUE HYDROGEN PROJECT MIGHT

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:11.423
ACHIEVE ACTUALLY MEET THOSE

02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:13.692
TARGETS. WE COMBINE THESE

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:16.128
QUESTIONS YOU START TO HAVE REAL

02:07:16.195 --> 02:07:18.697
REAL CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:07:18.764 --> 02:07:19.865
PATHWAYS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND

02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.667
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO REALLY

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.870
FULLY. CONSIDER THEM BEFORE

02:07:24.937 --> 02:07:27.573
TAKING A FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE STICK

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:29.908
APPROACH. SECOND WHEN IT COMES

02:07:29.975 --> 02:07:31.276
TO TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION AND

02:07:31.343 --> 02:07:33.312
STORAGE IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:07:33.379 --> 02:07:36.081
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HYDROGEN LEAKS

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:37.850
. THERE ARE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT

02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:39.918
COME WITH IT. AND THERE'S

02:07:39.985 --> 02:07:41.353
INCREASING INFORMATION COMING

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:43.989
OUT THE POTENTIAL OF HYDROGEN TO

02:07:44.056 --> 02:07:46.125
SERVICES INDIRECT. GREENHOUSE

02:07:46.191 --> 02:07:48.627
GAS POLLUTION. THAT MEANS WE

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:51.330
NEED FAR BETTER INFORMATION AND

02:07:51.397 --> 02:07:54.199
TRACKING ABOUT HYDROGEN LEAKAGE

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.334
TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:56.568
DEGREE TO WHICH THIS MIGHT

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:59.838
ACTUALLY FURTHER IMPACT THE

02:07:59.905 --> 02:08:01.840
CARBON AT THE GLOBAL WARMING

02:08:01.907 --> 02:08:04.710
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HYDROGEN MAY

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:06.345
OR MAY NOT HELP DRIVE DOWN. BOB

02:08:06.412 --> 02:08:08.047
IT'S ALSO GREAT HYDROGEN HAS

02:08:08.113 --> 02:08:10.115
SOME INEFFICIENCIES AND STORAGE

02:08:10.182 --> 02:08:12.818
AND SPACE CONSTRAINTS- THE PILOT

02:08:12.885 --> 02:08:14.420
PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING ONLINE

02:08:14.486 --> 02:08:15.721
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.022
WILL BE IMPORTANT TO COLLECT

02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:18.957
GRANULAR DATA ON AND TO FULLY

02:08:19.024 --> 02:08:21.560
CONSIDER WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:23.595
LINE. AND FINALLY IT COMES TO

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:25.497
THE STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION AND

02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:27.866
USES. WE KNOW THE HYDROGEN HAS

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:29.868
VALUE WE KNOW THAT IT HAS AN

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:32.171
IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY. BUT HE

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:33.739
INEFFICIENCY OF ITS PRODUCTION

02:08:33.806 --> 02:08:35.574
METHOD MEANS THAT VALUE COMES AT

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:37.709
THE COST. ESPECIALLY IN THE NEAR

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:39.778
TERM WE SHOULD BE PLACING A

02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:41.880
LARGE PREMIUM ON THE STRATEGIC

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:44.550
PRIORITIZATION OF ITS USE.

02:08:44.616 --> 02:08:46.418
BECAUSE SUPPLIES WILL BE LIMITED

02:08:46.485 --> 02:08:47.986
WE SHOULD BE DIRECTING HYDROGEN

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:49.288
TO WHERE THERE IS GREATEST

02:08:49.354 --> 02:08:50.722
VALUE. AND THAT INCLUDES

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:53.158
CONSIDERING WHERE THERE WILL BE

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:54.793
STEALING OPPORTUNITIES AND WHERE

02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.595
THERE WILL BE DENNIS. SO EVEN

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:57.763
THOUGH HYDROGEN CAN PLAY A ROLE

02:08:57.830 --> 02:09:01.433
IN EVERY SECTOR. AT AT POSSIBLY.

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.402
YOU KNOW ACT COST ANY GIVEN

02:09:03.469 --> 02:09:05.604
SKILL IT SHOULD NOT AND THERE

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:08.907
WILL BE REAL COSTS WERE WE TO

02:09:08.974 --> 02:09:10.542
COMMIT TO SUCH A WIDE SCALE USE

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:12.611
. IN FACT WHEN WE CAN DIRECTLY

02:09:12.678 --> 02:09:14.179
ELECTRIFIED WE ALWAYS SHOULD

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.914
BECAUSE THE EFFICIENCY GAINS

02:09:15.981 --> 02:09:17.516
WILL HELP US DISPLACE FOSSIL

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:21.086
FUELS FASTER. SO WE SHOULD

02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:23.288
ALWAYS CONSIDER HYDROGEN I

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:26.291
TESTING SECTORAL CONSIDERATIONS

02:09:26.358 --> 02:09:28.327
WITH IN OUR BROADER ECONOMY WIDE

02:09:28.393 --> 02:09:30.496
ASSESSMENT TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:32.764
HOW NEARER EVALUATIONS OF WHERE

02:09:32.831 --> 02:09:34.500
HYDROGEN MANY OR MAY NOT PLAY A

02:09:34.566 --> 02:09:36.301
ROLE IN A GIVEN SECTOR HOW THAT

02:09:36.368 --> 02:09:37.903
ALIGNS WITH THE BIGGER PICTURE

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:39.371
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OTHER AND

02:09:39.438 --> 02:09:42.141
USES FOR HYDROGEN MIGHT BE USED.

02:09:42.207 --> 02:09:46.145
INSTEAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:47.880
VERY MUCH OF THAT WAS OUR LAST

02:09:47.946 --> 02:09:49.882
PANELISTS I'D LIKE TO GO TO SEE

02:09:49.948 --> 02:09:51.483
IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY

02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:55.454
QUESTIONS MISTER MURATSUCHI.

02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:56.889
THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH MADAM

02:09:56.955 --> 02:10:00.025
CHAIR I WAS FOLLOWING THE FIRST

02:10:00.092 --> 02:10:04.129
PANEL. BY BROADCAST AND SO I

02:10:04.196 --> 02:10:04.730
APPRECIATE THIS VERY IMPORTANT

02:10:04.796 --> 02:10:09.067
TO A HEARING. I FIRST HAVE A FEW

02:10:09.134 --> 02:10:12.771
QUESTIONS FOR THE MR NAVIN WITH

02:10:12.838 --> 02:10:13.739
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS

02:10:13.805 --> 02:10:18.577
COMPANY. IF HE IS AVAILABLE GO

02:10:18.644 --> 02:10:20.179
AHEAD AND ASK IF THEY'LL POP

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:22.247
THEM OUT HERE TAUGHT OKAY ALL

02:10:22.314 --> 02:10:25.851
RIGHT- SO MISTER NAV AND YOU.

02:10:25.918 --> 02:10:28.754
DESCRIBE THE- WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.789
VERY EXCITING NEW PROJECT

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:33.091
ANGELES LINK POTENTIALLY THE

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:34.927
LARGEST PRODUCER OF GREEN

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:36.061
HYDRATION AND YOU TALKED ABOUT

02:10:36.128 --> 02:10:39.031
THE- HELLO B. WELL COULD YOU

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:41.667
TALK MORE ABOUT HOW- BASICALLY

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:44.002
THAT THE THAT THAT GREEN

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:47.039
HYDRATION- WOULD DO A WEE BIT

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:50.075
WOULD BE PRODUCED. CERTAINLY

02:10:50.142 --> 02:10:52.311
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THAT GREEN

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:54.846
HYDROGEN WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM

02:10:54.913 --> 02:10:58.383
A CURTAILED. AND NEW BUILD-

02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:01.954
RENEWABLE ENERGY SO THAT'S

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.156
SIMILAR TRADITIONAL RENEWABLES.

02:11:04.223 --> 02:11:08.660
WHAT SOURCED FROM AREAS OF HIGH

02:11:08.727 --> 02:11:11.330
OTHER HIGH SOLAR IRRADIANCE OR A

02:11:11.396 --> 02:11:13.298
HIGH WIND WITHIN THE STATE SO

02:11:13.365 --> 02:11:18.704
THOSE AREAS. OF THE STATE. THAT

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:20.072
TOWARD ARE CURRENTLY- PROVIDE A

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:21.206
SIGNAL AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE

02:11:21.273 --> 02:11:25.344
ELECTRICITY SO WOULD LOOK TO OUR

02:11:25.410 --> 02:11:28.313
- HE IS CURRENTLY CURTAIL OUR-

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:30.449
BOB AND NEW BEEN BUILT SOLAR AND

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:33.552
WIND TO PRODUCE GREEN HYDROGEN

02:11:33.619 --> 02:11:36.321
AND MOVE THE MOVE THAT HYDROGEN.

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:41.226
INTO THE LOS ANGELES BASIN WHERE

02:11:41.293 --> 02:11:43.262
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OFFTAKE

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:46.865
POTENTIAL INCLUDING- THE LOS

02:11:46.932 --> 02:11:47.899

02:11:53.639 --> 02:11:55.674
TRANSPORTATION THAT COMES IN AND

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:57.476
OUT OF THE PORT THAT'S CURRENTLY

02:11:57.542 --> 02:12:00.545
FUELED BY LARGELY DIESEL TRUCKS

02:12:00.612 --> 02:12:02.314
- THAT COULD BE TRANSITION TO

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:04.249
FUEL CELL VEHICLES FOR THOSE

02:12:04.316 --> 02:12:07.419
LONGER HAUL ROCKS. UP AND THAT

02:12:07.486 --> 02:12:10.455
ALSO TO- A HEAVY DUTYINDUSTRY

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:13.258

EXIST WITHIN THE BASIN WELL THAT

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:17.929
WELL AT SOME POINT NEED TO

02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:22.401
DECARBONISE. ABOUT MAY NEED- SO

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:24.503
EVEN THOUGH YOU REPRESENT THE

02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:27.539
GAS COMPANY. YOU'RE ENVISIONING

02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:29.608
THEY THE PROPOSAL FOR THE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:31.176
ANGELES LANG DOES NOT INVOLVE

02:12:31.243 --> 02:12:33.712
ANY USE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE

02:12:33.779 --> 02:12:35.914
PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN.

02:12:35.981 --> 02:12:37.249
WELL THAT'S CURRENT IN THE

02:12:37.316 --> 02:12:39.518
INTENT OF THE PROJECT IS

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:40.419
ACTUALLY TO SOURCE OUR GREEN

02:12:40.485 --> 02:12:43.121
HYDROGEN SO HYDROGEN FROM OUR-

02:12:43.188 --> 02:12:45.190
EXISTING RENEWABLES NEWBUILD

02:12:45.257 --> 02:12:47.392
RENEWABLES AND TO BRING THAT

02:12:47.459 --> 02:12:48.994
HYDROGEN INTO THE PREVIOUS AND-

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:50.862
SOME ALTERNATELY THE END EFFECT

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:53.298
WOULD BE TO DISPLACE- EXISTING

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:56.868
NATURAL GAS. USE WITHIN THE

02:12:56.935 --> 02:13:01.373
BASE. WHAT IS YOUR- PROPOSED

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.942
TIME LINE IN TERMS OF BRING IN

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:07.846
THIS ANGELES FLANK. ONLINE AND-

02:13:07.913 --> 02:13:10.148
WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOU- THE

02:13:10.215 --> 02:13:12.351
MAJOR OBSTACLES THEY USE AND FOR

02:13:12.417 --> 02:13:14.786
C. N. N. GETTING THIS UP AND

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:20.792
RUNNING. CERTAINLY WE- NUMBER OF

02:13:20.859 --> 02:13:21.993
WEEKS AGO SUBMITTED AN

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:23.929
APPLICATION TO THE CQC OR

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:25.797
MINIMAL CAL ESSENTIALLY AN

02:13:25.864 --> 02:13:27.566
ACCOUNT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO.

02:13:27.632 --> 02:13:32.437
START THE PLANNING PROCESS. AND

02:13:32.504 --> 02:13:34.272
THIS WOULD BE A STAKEHOLDER

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:35.273
ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT WOULD

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:39.344
LOOK TO INCLUDE- LEGISLATORS

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:42.180
REGULATORS- THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:13:42.247 --> 02:13:42.647
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

02:13:42.714 --> 02:13:47.252
COMMUNITIES. UP TO. LOOK AT THE

02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:49.421
SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.156
APPLICATION OF GREEN HYDROGEN

02:13:51.223 --> 02:13:54.126
WITHIN THE LOS ANGELES BASED. SO

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:56.128
WE WOULD PROPOSE A MULTI PHASE

02:13:56.194 --> 02:14:01.199
PROCESS TO MOSCOW AND- AND ROUTE

02:14:01.266 --> 02:14:02.601
THE PIPELINE AND THE

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:04.870
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GOES WITH IT

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.773
LOOKING AT THE OFF TAKERS-

02:14:07.839 --> 02:14:10.075
ENVIRONMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:12.411
THE PRODUCERS AS WELL. SO WE

02:14:12.477 --> 02:14:14.045
LOOK AT A PHASED APPROACH TO

02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:16.281
SCOPING AND THEN ULTIMATELY ONCE

02:14:16.348 --> 02:14:18.550
THE SCOPING WAS COMPLETE WE'VE

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:20.585
LEFT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:22.954
APPLY TO- TO BUILD UP THE

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:25.223
FACILITIES. SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:27.225
SAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE P.

02:14:27.292 --> 02:14:28.693
YOU SEE HERE ARE YOU ARE YOU

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.762
BASICALLY. PROPOSING THAT

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:33.865
RATEPAYERS PAY FOR THIS ANGELES

02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:37.002
FLANK. HELLO NOT WORD. AT THE

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:39.004
MOMENT WE'RE LOOKING AT SCOPING

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:42.107
THE PROJECT- AND THEN WE WOULD

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:45.410
LOOK TO. AT SOME POINT IN THE

02:14:45.477 --> 02:14:47.879
FUTURE LOOK AT THE- OF THE

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:50.248
ENTITIES THAT DERIVE THE BENEFIT

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:52.451
FROM THE- OUR PLANET FOR

02:14:52.517 --> 02:14:55.187
STRUCTURE AND ULTIMATELY THE

02:14:55.253 --> 02:14:57.322
COST WOULD ACCRUE TO THOSE-

02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:00.258
ENTITIES ULTIMATELY THOUGH THAT.

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:03.295
WOULD LIKELY REQUIRE EIGHT EIGHT

02:15:03.361 --> 02:15:04.629
NUMBER TO DETERMINE RATES

02:15:04.696 --> 02:15:07.499
SOMETHING FROM US BECAUSE

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:10.035
INITIAL. COULD YOU IDENTIFY THE

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:10.569
MAIN CATEGORIES OF THOSE

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:12.204
ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE PAYING

02:15:12.270 --> 02:15:15.841
FOR THIS WHAT ANGELES LINK. ONE

02:15:15.907 --> 02:15:18.143
ONE COULD ENVISION- DISPATCHABLE

02:15:18.210 --> 02:15:20.278
POWER GENERATION IF YOU DO THE

02:15:20.345 --> 02:15:25.484
INDUSTRY AND. THEN THE ONLY-

02:15:25.550 --> 02:15:27.452
ATTENTIONS. ARE THANK YOU VERY

02:15:27.519 --> 02:15:31.089
MUCH. THANK YOU ANY OTHER

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:33.158
PANELISTS SO I'LL ASK A WHILE

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:35.360
YOU'RE ON THE SCREEN I THINK I

02:15:35.427 --> 02:15:36.795
WILL ASK YOU- YOU MENTIONED

02:15:36.862 --> 02:15:38.396
SOURCING THE GREEN HYDROGEN I

02:15:38.463 --> 02:15:39.631
WAS A LITTLE UNCLEAR WHETHER

02:15:39.698 --> 02:15:41.533
YOU'RE PRODUCING IT OR WHETHER

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:42.634
YOU'RE PURCHASING IT AND BRING

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:46.671
IT IN. WE CERTAINLY A SECOND

02:15:46.738 --> 02:15:51.776
GAS- WOULD- YOURSELVES LARGELY

02:15:51.843 --> 02:15:53.879
AS- A CONNECTION BETWEEN.

02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:58.450
PRODUCTION AND- AND USERS SO WE

02:15:58.517 --> 02:16:00.385
WOULD NOT UNTO OURSELVES I'M

02:16:00.452 --> 02:16:02.087
SUGGEST THAT WE WOULD REDUCE THE

02:16:02.153 --> 02:16:02.621
GRADUATION SO WE CAN BE

02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:05.323
SOURCING. THE HYDROGEN FROM THE

02:16:05.390 --> 02:16:07.158
DEVELOPERS THAT WOULD LOVE TO.

02:16:07.225 --> 02:16:09.694
EITHER INCLUDE DIVERSION AS PART

02:16:09.761 --> 02:16:14.366
OF THEIR EXISTING. RENEWABLES

02:16:14.432 --> 02:16:17.102
GENERATION. IN INDOOR. THE NEW

02:16:17.168 --> 02:16:20.138
BUILT CONSTRUCTION SO WE UNTIL

02:16:20.205 --> 02:16:21.907
OURSELVES WOULD NOT BE A

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:23.308
PRODUCING HYDROGEN THE MIST

02:16:23.375 --> 02:16:24.609
THANK YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED A

02:16:24.676 --> 02:16:26.177
VARIETY OF END USES- YOU

02:16:26.244 --> 02:16:28.079
MENTIONED HEAVY INDUSTRY YOU

02:16:28.146 --> 02:16:29.447
MENTIONED TRANSPORTATION I THINK

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.416
TRANSPORTATION FUEL. BUT THERE'S

02:16:31.483 --> 02:16:34.119
ALSO THIS CONCEPT OF YOU YOU

02:16:34.185 --> 02:16:35.754
ALSO MENTION THOUGH BRINGING

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.924
INTO HOMES SO DOES THAT IS THAT

02:16:38.990 --> 02:16:40.759
STILL THE IDEA THAT YOU BLEND IT

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:43.128
WITH NATURAL GAS THEN AND REDUCE

02:16:43.194 --> 02:16:45.330
THE NATURAL GAS USE BY 7% OR

02:16:45.397 --> 02:16:48.533
SOMETHING OR IS THIS A TWO

02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:50.669
DIFFERENT IDEA FOR. SO ANGELES

02:16:50.735 --> 02:16:51.903
LINK ITSELF WOULD NOT THOSE

02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:53.471
THOSE MOLECULES WOULD NOT BE

02:16:53.538 --> 02:16:55.206
USED FOR HOMES WHAT WILL LIKELY

02:16:55.273 --> 02:16:56.741
HAVE A PARALLEL EFFORT TO LOOK

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:58.677
AT THE VIABILITY OF. A BLENDING

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:00.845
IS I THINK ONE OF THEM ASSEMBLY

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:02.147
MEMBERS MENTIONED BUT THE

02:17:02.213 --> 02:17:04.282
ANGELES LINK ITSELF IS INTENDED

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:06.985
TO BE A- GREEN HYDROGEN I

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:09.421
FLYING. IT WOULD SERVE THE HARD

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:11.022
TO ELECTRIFY SOME SECTORS OF THE

02:17:11.089 --> 02:17:12.891
LOS ANGELES REGION SO IT'S A

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.893
PHYSICAL PIPELINE THAT THEN YOU

02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.429
SOURCE HYDROGEN. AND YOU BRING

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:19.397
UP THE PIPELINE INTO LOS ANGELES

02:17:19.464 --> 02:17:21.099
AND THEN YOU BECOME A

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:23.501
DISTRIBUTION CENTER. FOR ALL

02:17:23.568 --> 02:17:24.936
THOSE DIFFERENT AND USES THAT

02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.404
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SET THE

02:17:26.471 --> 02:17:29.507
IDEA LOW YES CURRENT MANAGER YES

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:31.876
GOT IT THANK YOU NOW THAT'S AYE.

02:17:31.943 --> 02:17:35.847
AYE IT'S IT IT IS VERY

02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:38.183
INTERESTING. I'M LET ME GO BACK

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:39.017
COULD I FOLLOW- JUST. LET ME

02:17:39.084 --> 02:17:40.452
FINISH THE QUESTIONS WE CAN ASK

02:17:40.518 --> 02:17:41.853
WHOEVER YOU YOU WANT TO ASK

02:17:41.920 --> 02:17:43.822
QUESTIONS TO. YEAH THAT'S OKAY

02:17:43.888 --> 02:17:46.424
MISTER LEVIN WHY DON'T YOU ASK

02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:48.426
THE QUESTION OF ME WHY DON'T YOU

02:17:48.493 --> 02:17:49.361
ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT YOU

02:17:49.427 --> 02:17:52.330
WANTED US TO ASK YOU- REGARDING

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:54.199
THE HYDROGEN HUBS YES. CHAIR

02:17:54.265 --> 02:17:57.335
FRIEDMAN- SO FIRST OF ALL WE'RE

02:17:57.402 --> 02:17:58.870
VERY GRATIFIED THAT THE FEDERAL

02:17:58.937 --> 02:18:00.538
GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY REALLY

02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:02.540
STEPPING THROUGH FORWARD WITH. A

02:18:02.607 --> 02:18:05.343
VERY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM. TO

02:18:05.410 --> 02:18:07.445
INCREASE THE SCALE IN PRODUCTION

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:09.881
OF HYDROGEN- THERE ARE THREE

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:11.783
COMPONENTS TO THAT PROGRAM ONE

02:18:11.850 --> 02:18:13.485
IS PRODUCTION. THE OTHERS

02:18:13.551 --> 02:18:16.755
DISTRIBUTION IN THE THIRD IS OFF

02:18:16.821 --> 02:18:19.124
OFFTAKE WHERE IS THAT HYDROGEN

02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:22.560
GOING TO GO. UP THE SPEAKER FROM

02:18:22.627 --> 02:18:25.397
THE UCS. UCS MADE IT VERY CLEAR

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:26.931
THAT THERE ARE STILL MANY

02:18:26.998 --> 02:18:28.700
QUESTIONS ABOUT. HYDROGEN

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.468
PRODUCTION AND THE WHOLE

02:18:30.535 --> 02:18:32.771
MANAGEMENT OF HYDROGEN IN ORDER

02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:35.373
TO ENSURE A CLEAN SOURCE. AND SO

02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.143
THAT HAS TO BE A FACTOR THAT HAS

02:18:38.209 --> 02:18:40.211
BEEN EMPHASIZED VERY STRONGLY

02:18:40.278 --> 02:18:42.213
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.050
BECAUSE OUR STATE HAS BEEN A

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:46.584
LEADER IN MOVING THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:18:46.651 --> 02:18:48.586
FORWARD AND I SPOKE OF ONE OF

02:18:48.653 --> 02:18:50.355
THE PROJECTS WERE INVOLVED IN.

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:51.489
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS AS

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:53.858
WELL. WE ARE IN THE BEST

02:18:53.925 --> 02:18:56.761
POSITION. TO LEVERAGE TO PROVIDE

02:18:56.828 --> 02:18:59.064
COST SHARE. AND LEVERAGE THE

02:18:59.130 --> 02:19:01.533
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING MY

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:04.502
GUESS IS FROM WHAT WE BURDEN-

02:19:04.569 --> 02:19:06.705
YOUR WORKSHOPS. IS THERE. THEIR

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:08.540
FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON

02:19:08.606 --> 02:19:10.608
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. A

02:19:10.675 --> 02:19:11.910
TO INCREASE THE SCALE OF

02:19:11.976 --> 02:19:15.113
RODUCTION. UP BUT IN ORDER TO

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:17.916
MATCH THAT WE NEED. TO ENSURE

02:19:17.982 --> 02:19:19.584
THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE OR

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:22.353
SIGNIFICANT OFFTAKE. AND I THINK

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.256
CALIFORNIA IS IN A VERY GOOD

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:26.491
POSITION. TO COST SHARE THAT

02:19:26.558 --> 02:19:28.927
OFFTAKE PORTION OF IT WE'RE VERY

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:30.895
FAR ADVANCED MORE THAN ANY OTHER

02:19:30.962 --> 02:19:32.464
STATE. IN SOME CASES

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:34.499
INTERNATIONALLY WITH RESPECT TO

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:36.434
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:38.770
UTILIZING HYDROGEN FOR THOSE

02:19:38.837 --> 02:19:43.274
PURPOSES. SO I WOULD HOPE THE

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:43.942
CALIFORNIA IN ITS STRATEGY TO BE

02:19:44.008 --> 02:19:45.744
ONE OF THE HUBS AND I IT WELL

02:19:45.810 --> 02:19:47.545
THE INITIAL LEGISLATION TALKED

02:19:47.612 --> 02:19:50.281
ABOUT FOUR HUBS AT ROUGHLY TWO

02:19:50.348 --> 02:19:52.117
BILLION DOLLARS PER HUB. THE

02:19:52.183 --> 02:19:53.551
LATEST DISCUSSIONS IN THE

02:19:53.618 --> 02:19:55.553
WORKSHOPS WITH DEAL WE IS

02:19:55.620 --> 02:19:58.189
SOMEWHERE AROUND TEN TEN HOBBS

02:19:58.256 --> 02:20:00.325
THAT COULD BE FUNDED UPWARDS OF

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:01.960
A HALF A BILLION TO A BILLION

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:04.896
DOLLARS AT 50% COST SHARE. SO

02:20:04.963 --> 02:20:07.699
THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ONE

02:20:07.766 --> 02:20:08.633
TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS

02:20:08.700 --> 02:20:11.102
CALIFORNIA IS IN A VERY GOOD

02:20:11.169 --> 02:20:13.004
POSITION TO THE PROPERTY COST

02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:15.173
SHARE THAT. BUT IN DOING THAT

02:20:15.240 --> 02:20:16.908
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:18.943
ENSURE THAT THERE'S OFF TAKE FOR

02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:21.713
THAT FUEL AND WE ARE IN A VERY

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.949
GOOD POSITION. TO EXPAND SUCH AS

02:20:25.016 --> 02:20:27.585
THE PROJECT I SPOKE OF EARLIER.

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:30.188
OF THIRTY TRUCKS TO BUILD TWO

02:20:30.255 --> 02:20:31.656
HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED TRUCKS

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.658
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:36.060
OFF TAKE AND MAKE A REAL

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.228
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE

02:20:37.295 --> 02:20:40.231
IMPACT ON CRITERIA MISSIONS ON

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:42.534
PORCH IN THE LIGHT. SO I WOULD

02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:45.069
LIKE TO SEE CALIFORNIA LOOKING

02:20:45.136 --> 02:20:47.505
AT WAYS TO LEVERAGE ITS

02:20:47.572 --> 02:20:51.209
RESOURCES. TO GO AFTER THE

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:52.410
FEDERAL FUNDING I DON'T THINK

02:20:52.477 --> 02:20:55.113
THERE'S ANY DOUBT THE CALIFORNIA

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:57.182
SHOULD AND CAN BE ONE OF THOSE

02:20:57.248 --> 02:20:59.784
HUBS THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE

02:20:59.851 --> 02:21:02.287
IS THAT THERE IS NOT A LARGE

02:21:02.353 --> 02:21:04.455
NETWORK OF PIPELINES THAT IS.

02:21:04.522 --> 02:21:06.257
CLEARLY ONE OF THE POTENTIAL

02:21:06.324 --> 02:21:08.193
POTENTIALLY CHEAPEST WAYS OF

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:10.528
MOVING HYDROGEN. SO WITHOUT THAT

02:21:10.595 --> 02:21:12.764
PIPELINE WHICH DOES EXIST IN

02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:16.668
MUCH GREATER. NUMBERS IN TEXAS

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:18.736
OKLAHOMA IN THE STATES ARE

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:21.906
PRIMARILY ARE REFINED REORIENTED

02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:23.975
WE NEED TO MOVE IT WITH

02:21:24.042 --> 02:21:24.375
TRANSPORTATION AND

02:21:24.442 --> 02:21:27.078
TRANSPORTATION. DOES COST

02:21:27.145 --> 02:21:29.447
CRITERIA MISSIONS WHEN YOU

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:32.383
TRANSPORT BY TRUCK. BUT HERE WE

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:34.385
NOW HAVE FUEL CELL TRUCKS THAT

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:38.156
WE BELIEVE CAN MOVE THAT FUEL.

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:40.358
WITH ZERO EMISSIONS IN THE

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.894
TRANSPORTATION OF IT SO THAT'S

02:21:42.961 --> 02:21:44.295
ANOTHER COMPONENT OF IT THAT I

02:21:44.362 --> 02:21:46.264
THINK WE CAN LEAD THE WAY IN

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:49.367
DOING THAT. THANK YOU I'D LIKE

02:21:49.434 --> 02:21:51.236
TO ASK A QUESTION OF MS

02:21:51.302 --> 02:21:54.973
MCNAMARA- YOU MENTIONED. THE

02:21:55.039 --> 02:21:57.442
NECESSITY FOR US TO EVALUATE

02:21:57.509 --> 02:21:59.310
EMISSIONS NOT JUST OUT

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:01.079
PRODUCTION BUT THROUGH THE WHOLE

02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:04.015
A CHAIN OF USE OF HYDROGEN AND I

02:22:04.082 --> 02:22:06.084
WAS JUST CURIOUS GIVEN THAT IT'S

02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:08.620
A ZERO EMISSION FUEL WHAT YOU

02:22:08.686 --> 02:22:10.855
MEAN BY THAT EXACTLY. WHAT WHAT

02:22:10.922 --> 02:22:15.026
WOULD BE THE MISSED EMISSIONS

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:16.160
DOWN THE ROAD THAT YOU'RE

02:22:16.227 --> 02:22:19.163
THINKING OF. SURE SO. WHEN WE

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:21.866
THINK OF HYDROGEN'S USE ADS IN A

02:22:21.933 --> 02:22:23.468
FUEL CELL VEHICLE FOR EXAMPLE

02:22:23.534 --> 02:22:26.170
YOU WON'T HAVE THE MISSIONS ARE

02:22:26.237 --> 02:22:28.273
RIGHT FROM THE TAIL PIPE ONLY

02:22:28.339 --> 02:22:30.541
WATER. FOUND BUT WE THINK ABOUT

02:22:30.608 --> 02:22:32.377
HOW TO HOW THAT HYDROGEN IS

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.145
PRODUCED YOU COULD HAVE

02:22:34.212 --> 02:22:36.180
ELECTROLYTIC DRIVEN FULLY BY

02:22:36.247 --> 02:22:37.649
RENEWABLE SIR USING CLEAN

02:22:37.715 --> 02:22:39.784
ELECTRICITY TO SPLIT WATER AND

02:22:39.851 --> 02:22:42.220
THERE ARE NO EMISSIONS. FROM BUT

02:22:42.287 --> 02:22:43.588
THERE ARE ALSO DISCUSSIONS AS

02:22:43.655 --> 02:22:45.089
THE FIRST PRESENTATION MENTIONED

02:22:45.156 --> 02:22:48.226
OF USING NATURAL GAS FOR EXAMPLE

02:22:48.293 --> 02:22:49.694
STEAM METHANE REFORMING THE

02:22:49.761 --> 02:22:54.032
PRIMARY METHOD OF PRODUCING.

02:22:54.098 --> 02:22:54.933
HYDROGEN TODAY RIGHT. YOU'RE

02:22:54.999 --> 02:22:55.934
TALKING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION AND

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.402
YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LEADER

02:22:57.468 --> 02:23:00.271
DOWN DOWNSTREAM I THINK I MAY

02:23:00.338 --> 02:23:02.173
HAVE MISSED. IT YES I DID

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:04.075
MENTION IT YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT I

02:23:04.142 --> 02:23:05.743
WAS TALKING ABOUT PRODUCTION

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.912
THERE IS ALSO THE POTENTIAL.

02:23:07.979 --> 02:23:10.315
LEAKAGE OF HYDROGEN WHICH IS NOW

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:11.983
THE SUBJECT OF A DISCUSSION

02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:15.320
PAPER. AND GROWING STUDY- THE

02:23:15.386 --> 02:23:17.555
DEGREE TO WHICH HYDROGEN IS AN

02:23:17.622 --> 02:23:19.123
INDIRECT GLOBAL WARMING

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.825
POLLUTANT AND SO IT'S ALL

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:23.828
LEAKAGE CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE. TO

02:23:23.895 --> 02:23:25.964
GLOBAL WARMING MUCH LIKE NOTHING

02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:28.733
HAVE WE- HOW- RAPE OR THOSE

02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:30.535
STUDIES I MEAN DO WE HAVE ANY

02:23:30.601 --> 02:23:32.270
INDICATION OF HOW IT WOULD

02:23:32.337 --> 02:23:33.571
COMPARE FOR INSTANCE TO METHANE

02:23:33.638 --> 02:23:36.107
OR NATURAL GAS. WHEN IT THE IN

02:23:36.174 --> 02:23:37.342
ITS LEAKAGE PROFILE AND I'M I'M

02:23:37.408 --> 02:23:39.377
NOT SAYING WHETHER AT LEAST MORE

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:40.745
I'M SAYING WHEN IT DOES WHAT'S

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:42.380
THE COME WHAT'S THE SORT OF

02:23:42.447 --> 02:23:43.815
COMPARISON OF DAMAGE DONE AND IS

02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:45.316
IT A GREENHOUSE GAS.

02:23:45.383 --> 02:23:48.486
CONTRIBUTORS IT'S NOT BUT THE

02:23:48.553 --> 02:23:50.088
WAY IT FUNCTIONS AS AS AN

02:23:50.154 --> 02:23:51.422
INDIRECT POLLUTANT SO FOR

02:23:51.489 --> 02:23:54.192
EXAMPLE ONE OF THOSE PATHWAYS

02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:56.260
DESPITE. I'M INTERFERING WITH

02:23:56.327 --> 02:23:57.695
THE MOLECULES THAT BREAKS DOWN

02:23:57.762 --> 02:23:59.630
METHANE SO MAKING EXISTS IN THE

02:23:59.697 --> 02:24:02.200
ATMOSPHERE OR LONGER. THERE IS

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:05.003
RESEARCH. AND SOME UNDERSTANDING

02:24:05.069 --> 02:24:07.672
ALREADY TODAY. OF HYDROGENS

02:24:07.739 --> 02:24:10.241
GENERAL HOWEVER THERE'S ONLY A

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.243
MERGING RESEARCH NOW THAT STILL

02:24:12.310 --> 02:24:14.445
GOING THROUGH. PUBLICATION AND I

02:24:14.512 --> 02:24:16.381
THINK THERE'S BEEN A FEW OUT BUT

02:24:16.447 --> 02:24:18.182
THEY'RE STILL. CERTAINLY UNDER

02:24:18.249 --> 02:24:21.185
DISCUSSION- ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

02:24:21.252 --> 02:24:23.021
FOR IT ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:25.256
SHORTER TIMELINES. THE HOBBIT

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:26.858
OUTSIZED EFFECT MUCH LIKE WE

02:24:26.924 --> 02:24:28.559
THINK OF MATTHEW RIGHT WE LOOK

02:24:28.626 --> 02:24:30.561
AT A SHORTER TIMELINE COMPARED

02:24:30.628 --> 02:24:32.530
TO CARBON DIOXIDE. IT HAS A HIGH

02:24:32.597 --> 02:24:34.465
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL IF YOU%

02:24:34.532 --> 02:24:37.168
LOOK OVER THE LONGER PERIOD THIS

02:24:37.235 --> 02:24:38.369
IS LESS. I WOULD JUST REITERATE

02:24:38.436 --> 02:24:39.504
I THINK IT'S AN AREA OF

02:24:39.570 --> 02:24:42.073
IMPORTANT RESEARCH I THINK IT'S

02:24:42.140 --> 02:24:44.208
AN IMPORTANT AREA TO TRACK- THEM

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:50.214
BUT. BUT BUT IT IS NOT SETTLED.

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:51.349
OKAY YOU KNOW IT IT'S- I FULLY

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:52.817
UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO BE

02:24:52.884 --> 02:24:54.819
VERY AWARE AS WE MOVE INTO THESE

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:57.288
TECHNOLOGIES OF. UNINTENDED

02:24:57.355 --> 02:25:00.391
CONSEQUENCES AND OF ANY OF THEIR

02:25:00.458 --> 02:25:03.261
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS- IT IS

02:25:03.327 --> 02:25:04.429
INTERESTING TO ME AND I DON'T

02:25:04.495 --> 02:25:06.764
KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER THIS

02:25:06.831 --> 02:25:07.965
OR NOT THAT IT'S INTERESTING

02:25:08.032 --> 02:25:09.367
THAT HYDROGEN IS KIND OF GETTING

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:11.969
SO MUCH SCRUTINY. WHEN AND AS

02:25:12.036 --> 02:25:15.039
SOMEONE WHO DEFINITELY SUPPORTS-

02:25:15.106 --> 02:25:16.941
EVEY TECHNOLOGY IN

02:25:17.008 --> 02:25:19.210
ELECTRIFICATION- YEAH I THINK

02:25:19.277 --> 02:25:20.344
THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENCE

02:25:20.411 --> 02:25:20.745
BETWEEN A LECTURE

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:22.613
ELECTRIFICATION WHERE YOU HAVE A

02:25:22.680 --> 02:25:23.481
RENEWABLE SOURCE AND YOU'RE-

02:25:23.548 --> 02:25:26.050
PUTTING INTO YOUR GRID AND POWER

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:27.985
IN YOUR HOME WITH IT. AND THE

02:25:28.052 --> 02:25:30.054
IMPACT THAT WE SEE FOR MINING

02:25:30.121 --> 02:25:31.022
FOR LITHIUM AND THINGS THAT

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:32.857
POWER OF THIS THE KIND OF STATIC

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.625
BATTERIES THAT GO INTO ELECTRIC

02:25:34.692 --> 02:25:37.929
VEHICLES. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION

02:25:37.995 --> 02:25:40.531
IS ARE WE- YES WE NEED TO BE

02:25:40.598 --> 02:25:42.300
SKEPTICAL OR WE NEED TO BE

02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:44.335
CONCERNED BUT ARE WE PUTTING

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:46.070
HYDROGEN THROUGH HOOPS THAT

02:25:46.137 --> 02:25:47.638
WE'RE NOT PUTTING. ELECTRIC

02:25:47.705 --> 02:25:52.276
BATTERIES THROUGH- I YOU KNOW I

02:25:52.343 --> 02:25:54.579
JUST I'VE NEVER HEARD. YOU KNOW

02:25:54.645 --> 02:25:55.513
ENVIRONMENTALISTS COME IN

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.949
RAISING SO MANY CONCERNS ABOUT

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:00.384
ELECTRIC CARS AS I SEEM TO BE

02:26:00.451 --> 02:26:01.319
HEARING ABOUT HYDROGEN AND I'M

02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:03.721
JUST WONDERING. IF YOU HAVE ANY

02:26:03.788 --> 02:26:06.491
COMMENT ABOUT THAT. SURE I

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:08.559
APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION AND YET

02:26:08.626 --> 02:26:10.027
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL

02:26:10.094 --> 02:26:13.131
STAKEHOLDERS. BOTH WHAT I CAN

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:16.234
SAY IS WHERE ICS NOW STANDING ON

02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:19.103
THE THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANT

02:26:19.170 --> 02:26:21.706
ENERGY TRANSITION WE HAVE AN

02:26:21.772 --> 02:26:24.509
OPPORTUNITY. TO LOOK BACK AND

02:26:24.575 --> 02:26:26.043
SEE THAT MISSTEPS WE'VE MADE TO

02:26:26.110 --> 02:26:27.378
DATE THAT THINGS WE SHOULD HAVE

02:26:27.445 --> 02:26:29.113
SEEN AND DID NOT BEFORE WE

02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:31.249
COMMITTED TO PATHWAYS SUCH AS

02:26:31.315 --> 02:26:32.884
ARE FAR GREATER UNDERSTANDING

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:34.852
NOW OF METHANE LEAKAGE FROM

02:26:34.919 --> 02:26:37.889
NATURAL GAS SYSTEM. AB ORDERED

02:26:37.955 --> 02:26:39.290
PROTECT THE CRITERIA AIR

02:26:39.357 --> 02:26:40.958
POLLUTANTS FROM COMBUSTION SOME

02:26:41.025 --> 02:26:43.094
FORMS OF FOSSIL FUELS COMPARED

02:26:43.161 --> 02:26:45.796
TO OTHERS WHEN WE TAKE THIS

02:26:45.863 --> 02:26:47.398
BROADER PERSPECTIVE AND WE LOOK

02:26:47.465 --> 02:26:49.133
AT THE LOCAL AIR POLLUTION WE

02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:50.768
LOOK AT THE- BROADER

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.703
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS WE CAN SEE

02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:54.472
WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN A DIFFERENT

02:26:54.539 --> 02:26:56.407
PATH THAN. BUT TODAY WE'RE

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:58.009
STANDING HERE LOOKING AT THIS

02:26:58.075 --> 02:26:59.510
BROAD SUITE OF SOLUTIONS

02:26:59.577 --> 02:27:02.079
AVAILABLE TO US OR WE HAVE TIME

02:27:02.146 --> 02:27:04.182
ON THE LINE RIGHT WE KNOW WE

02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:05.750
WANT TO TAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE

02:27:05.816 --> 02:27:07.752
PATH. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE'RE

02:27:07.818 --> 02:27:09.654
TRULY THINKING ABOUT ALL THE

02:27:09.720 --> 02:27:12.590
POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS BEFORE WE

02:27:12.657 --> 02:27:15.059
COMMIT TO POWER AGAIN I DO WANT

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:16.360
TO REITERATE THAT THE START OF

02:27:16.427 --> 02:27:19.297
MY COMMENTS IT DIDN'T. TRY TO

02:27:19.363 --> 02:27:21.432
EMPHASIZE THE FACT THAT WE

02:27:21.499 --> 02:27:23.401
SHOULD NOT BE PARALYZED BY THESE

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.169
CONCERNS WE HAVE TO KEEP THE

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:27.438
SUITE OF SOLUTIONS OPEN BUT WE

02:27:27.505 --> 02:27:28.773
SHOULDN'T DO IT WITH A NARROW

02:27:28.839 --> 02:27:30.508
MINDSET WHERE WE WHERE WE GET

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:32.476
MORE WHAT COULD REALLY HELPED

02:27:32.543 --> 02:27:35.112
SHAPE A BETTER PASSWORD. YEAH

02:27:35.179 --> 02:27:36.714
AND YOU ALSO MADE THE POINT I

02:27:36.781 --> 02:27:37.815
THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD POINT

02:27:37.882 --> 02:27:40.318
THAT WE KNOW WHAT WHAT SECTORS

02:27:40.384 --> 02:27:41.419
ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO

02:27:41.485 --> 02:27:43.688
DECARBONISE AND FOCUSING ON

02:27:43.754 --> 02:27:46.090
THOSE WITH THIS RELATIVELY NEW

02:27:46.157 --> 02:27:47.425
TECHNOLOGY I MEAN MAYBE IT'S NOT

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:50.127
RELATIVELY NEW BUT AT LEAST ARE

02:27:50.194 --> 02:27:51.229
SORT OF. COMPREHENSIVE AND

02:27:51.295 --> 02:27:52.463
HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:27:52.530 --> 02:27:54.298
IMPACTS ARE STILL DEVELOPING

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:55.533
THAT FOCUSING ON THE THINGS THAT

02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.401
WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:27:57.468 --> 02:27:59.203
TOUGHER RATHER THAN THE ONES

02:27:59.270 --> 02:28:00.404
THAT. YOU KNOW OUR EASIER DEALT

02:28:00.471 --> 02:28:02.473
WITH WITH OTHER ZERO EMISSION

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:09.080
TECHNOLOGIES. MAYBE IS- CAN IT

02:28:09.146 --> 02:28:11.048
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE THE FOLK

02:28:11.115 --> 02:28:13.084
AYE A- THAT PERSPECTIVE WELL- I

02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:13.651
WILL GO TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:28:13.718 --> 02:28:14.385
BENNETT WHO I THINK HAS SOME

02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:16.053
QUESTIONS AS WELL. THANK THANK

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:17.521
YOU FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:28:17.588 --> 02:28:18.789
GAS REPRESENTATIVE AND THEN I'D

02:28:18.856 --> 02:28:20.591
LIKE TO COME BACK TO THE UNION

02:28:20.658 --> 02:28:21.892
OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS TO

02:28:21.959 --> 02:28:27.632
REPRESENTATIVE. RATHER THAN A

02:28:27.698 --> 02:28:29.600
SWITCHING I'M HAPPY TO SWITCH MY

02:28:29.667 --> 02:28:30.668
ORDER QUESTIONS BUT WE LOVE

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:35.039
THAT- IT WILL. I REALIZE THAT

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:36.874
SHE'S ON THE SCREEN ALL RIGHT

02:28:36.941 --> 02:28:39.010
LET ME JUST WHICH MY ORDER

02:28:39.076 --> 02:28:40.177
QUESTIONS HERE AND IF- IF THAT'S

02:28:40.244 --> 02:28:43.381
OKAY- I APPRECIATE THE- QUESTION

02:28:43.447 --> 02:28:47.551
THAT- MADAM CHAIR- ASKED ABOUT-

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:49.287
THE SCRUTINY IT YOU KNOW IN

02:28:49.353 --> 02:28:51.055
TERMS OF HYDROGEN AND WAS GOING

02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:55.159
FORWARD- THE- N. I. I AGREE WITH

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:57.161
YOU WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE TRYING

02:28:57.228 --> 02:29:01.866
TO- IDENTIFY WATER THE UNKNOWNS

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:03.834
AS AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. OF

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:04.902
STRIVE COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS

02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:06.704
ARE ONE ARE THE EUROPEANS WHO

02:29:06.771 --> 02:29:08.439
SEEM TO BE MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE

02:29:08.506 --> 02:29:10.207
ROAD ON HYDROGEN AND WE ARE ARE

02:29:10.274 --> 02:29:13.978
THEY IDENTIFYING HYDROGEN AS A-

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:16.147
AS A YOU KNOW AS AN-

02:29:16.213 --> 02:29:18.516
ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM OR IS JUST

02:29:18.582 --> 02:29:21.352
IS JUST MOSTLY JUST BE BEING

02:29:21.419 --> 02:29:22.920
IDENTIFIED AS SOMETHING THAT

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:24.822
SHOULD BE RESEARCH. BUT NOBODY'S

02:29:24.889 --> 02:29:26.590
ACTUALLY YOU KNOW NOBODY THAT'S

02:29:26.657 --> 02:29:30.127
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD IS

02:29:30.194 --> 02:29:31.228
IDENTIFYING IT AS AN ACTUAL

02:29:31.295 --> 02:29:32.930
PROBLEM. I APPRECIATE THE

02:29:32.997 --> 02:29:36.934
QUESTION- THIS IS A VERY ACTIVE

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:39.136
POINT OF DISCUSSION IN EUROPE-

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:43.641
AND IN FACT I WOULD- SUGGESTS

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.543
THAT THEY ARE PURSUING FAR MORE

02:29:45.609 --> 02:29:47.845
AMBITIOUS STANDARDS WHEN IT

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.747
COMES TO THE CURRENT INTENSITY

02:29:49.814 --> 02:29:53.751
AND OVERALL- PRODUCTION PICTURE.

02:29:53.818 --> 02:29:55.419
AND ENTITIES PICTURE OF

02:29:55.486 --> 02:29:58.989
HYDROGEN- COMPARED TO WHERE WE

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:02.360
ARE AT. THE NATIONAL LEVEL TODAY

02:30:02.426 --> 02:30:04.495
I WILL SAY THERE ARE SOME GOOD

02:30:04.562 --> 02:30:06.797
INITIATIVES NOW UNDERWAY. I'M

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:08.799
HERE BUT I WOULD SAY WE'RE INTO

02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:11.035
CATCH UP MODE AND- WHAT WE

02:30:11.102 --> 02:30:13.471
CONSIDERED MANY OF THE PROPOSALS

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:15.005
THAT HAVE COME UP AND I SPEAK

02:30:15.072 --> 02:30:17.975
ACROSS THE COUNTRY I DON'T SPEAK

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.710
JUST TO CALIFORNIA. WE'VE SEEN

02:30:19.777 --> 02:30:21.879
OUR OWN LARGE BIASED TOWARDS

02:30:21.946 --> 02:30:23.881
NATURAL GAS BASED HYDROGEN

02:30:23.948 --> 02:30:27.451
SOLUTIONS. AND CALCULATIONS THAT

02:30:27.518 --> 02:30:29.220
WOULD ALLOW HYDROGEN FROM THOSE

02:30:29.286 --> 02:30:32.323
FORMS HERE THAT WOULD NEVER PASS

02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:34.725
THE TEST IN EUROPE I'M SO

02:30:34.792 --> 02:30:35.960
DISAPPOINTED JUST WHEN WE THINK

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:37.661
ABOUT TRADE THAT THEY WOULDN'T

02:30:37.728 --> 02:30:40.097
QUALIFY GREAT AS I CERTAINLY

02:30:40.164 --> 02:30:41.232
UNDERSTAND THAT FROM THE

02:30:41.298 --> 02:30:44.168
STANDPOINT OF PRODUCTION AS

02:30:44.235 --> 02:30:47.271
MADAME BETTER. IDENTIFIED IF

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:48.906
IT'S THE QUESTION OF ARE YOU

02:30:48.973 --> 02:30:50.441
GOING TO PRODUCE IT WITH

02:30:50.508 --> 02:30:51.375
SOMETHING ELSE WITH A FOSSIL

02:30:51.442 --> 02:30:52.843
FUEL VERSUS IF YOU'RE A PRODUCER

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:56.013
WITH RENEWABLES BUT WHAT IS NEW

02:30:56.080 --> 02:30:57.615
TO ME THAT I'M HEARING FOR THE

02:30:57.681 --> 02:30:58.816
FIRST TIME IS JUST THE ACTUAL

02:30:58.883 --> 02:31:00.551
PRODUCING OF HYDROGEN NO MATTER

02:31:00.618 --> 02:31:01.485
HOW YOU PRODUCE IF YOU PRODUCE

02:31:01.552 --> 02:31:03.587
IT WITH RENEWABLES THE IDEA THAT

02:31:03.654 --> 02:31:05.723
IT MIGHT LEAK AND MIGHT CAUSE A

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:07.825
PROBLEM. AT LEAST AT THIS POINT

02:31:07.892 --> 02:31:09.994
TIME I WANT TO PUT IN THE

02:31:10.060 --> 02:31:11.595
CATEGORY OF THAT'S A RESEARCH

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:15.499
POSSIBILITY BUT THERE'S NO.

02:31:15.566 --> 02:31:16.367
EVIDENCE OF THAT YET IS THAT

02:31:16.434 --> 02:31:18.903
CORRECT. HELLO WE'VE ALSO SEEN

02:31:18.969 --> 02:31:20.404
IT M. THE STATE AS A POTENTIAL

02:31:20.471 --> 02:31:22.873
SENSITIVITY TO INCLUDE IN SOME

02:31:22.940 --> 02:31:26.744
COUNTRIES ANALYSES OF THE- OF

02:31:26.811 --> 02:31:29.180
THE PICTURE THE OTHER. THE OTHER

02:31:29.246 --> 02:31:30.848
WAY I'D SAY THAT EUROPE HAS BEEN

02:31:30.915 --> 02:31:32.883
FULLY CONSIDERING HYDROGEN IS BY

02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:34.885
PURSUING THE STRATEGIC ROADMAPS

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.620
THAT LOOK KIND OF THE WIDE AND

02:31:36.687 --> 02:31:38.422
THEN SECTOR BY SECTOR WITHIN

02:31:38.489 --> 02:31:40.357
SURE I STARTED TO BE HARD TO

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:41.725
HEAR THIS EARLIER PRESENTATION

02:31:41.792 --> 02:31:43.828
THAT INCLUDED A CONSIDERATION OF

02:31:43.894 --> 02:31:45.496
THE BIGGER PICTURE OF HYDROGEN

02:31:45.563 --> 02:31:47.298
BECAUSE THAT HELPS GUIDE BEFORE

02:31:47.364 --> 02:31:48.599
COURSE GREAT THANK YOU I

02:31:48.666 --> 02:31:50.201
APPRECIATE AND I DON'T MEAN TO

02:31:50.267 --> 02:31:51.802
CATCH UP ON YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:31:51.869 --> 02:31:53.571
TRYING TO. GET TO GET THROUGH

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:55.973
ALL THE STUFF THAT HE IS THERE

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.174
AN EQUAL CONCERN ON THE EASY

02:31:57.241 --> 02:32:01.378
SIDE ABOUT. IF IMAGINE IF WE

02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:04.515
HAVE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY AS WE

02:32:04.582 --> 02:32:06.584
ELECTRIFY VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:08.419
AS- NIKOL CONCERN ABOUT THE

02:32:08.486 --> 02:32:09.887
RECYCLING OF ALL THESE BATTERIES

02:32:09.954 --> 02:32:11.522
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:13.757
MINING OF ALL THE RARE EARTH

02:32:13.824 --> 02:32:14.525
MINERALS- FOR THE BATTERY

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:17.795
TECHNOLOGY IS THAT ALSO. EQUALLY

02:32:17.862 --> 02:32:21.332
BEING A POINT OF CONCERNS AND

02:32:21.398 --> 02:32:22.566
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAVE

02:32:22.633 --> 02:32:24.668
FURTHER RESEARCH I HEAR BROUGHT

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:26.036
UP FOR HYDROGEN IN THIS HEARING

02:32:26.103 --> 02:32:31.442
I DON'T HEAR THAT BROUGHT UP-

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:32.576
FOR THEBATTERY SIDE OF THIS

02:32:32.643 --> 02:32:34.345
ALSO. WE'RE SIT THIS IS A IN

02:32:34.411 --> 02:32:35.613
IMPORTANT POINT OF CONVERSATION

02:32:35.679 --> 02:32:37.715
AND YES THE SOURCING AS WELL AS

02:32:37.781 --> 02:32:40.050
THE END USE RECYCLING. OF

02:32:40.117 --> 02:32:41.552
MATERIALS THROUGHOUT THE CLEAN

02:32:41.619 --> 02:32:42.720
ENERGY SUPPLY CHAIN FROM

02:32:42.786 --> 02:32:44.655
ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO SOLAR

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.257
PANELS THINKING ABOUT ALL THE

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:48.759
FEES. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:32:48.826 --> 02:32:50.127
WE'RE MAKING THAT THAT SUPPLY

02:32:50.194 --> 02:32:52.363
CHAIN CLEANER MORE DEFINITELY

02:32:52.429 --> 02:32:55.199
PERCEIVED THANK YOU AND DAN I

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.901
APPRECIATE THAT WE ALL ARE

02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:59.003
WRESTLING WITH THIS QUESTION.

02:32:59.069 --> 02:33:01.038
AND I THINK I CAPTURED IT IN

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:04.475
WHAT YOU SAID I JUST WANT TO

02:33:04.542 --> 02:33:05.442
CONFIRM THAT AND THAT IS. WE

02:33:05.509 --> 02:33:07.745
HAVE THIS RACE AND THAT WE COULD

02:33:07.811 --> 02:33:11.682
WAIT TOO LONG. AND STUDY AND

02:33:11.749 --> 02:33:13.984
HAVE THE CLIMB IT GETS SO BAD

02:33:14.051 --> 02:33:16.554
THAT IT IT'S MAKES IT LESS

02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.522
MEANINGFUL WHAT CHANGES WE MAKE

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:20.057
WE ALL KNOW THAT WE THERE'S WE

02:33:20.124 --> 02:33:21.759
HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME.

02:33:21.825 --> 02:33:24.094
AND SO WE HAVE A TRADE OFF TO

02:33:24.161 --> 02:33:26.530
HOW INTENSELY. DO WE DO THE

02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:29.767
RESEARCH FOR SIS- YOU KNOW DOING

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:31.435
SOMETHING AND THEN IF WE SEE A

02:33:31.502 --> 02:33:33.037
PROBLEM TRYING TO ADJUST FROM

02:33:33.103 --> 02:33:34.772
THERE SO THAT WE AT LEAST

02:33:34.838 --> 02:33:36.307
ADJUST. IT AM I CORRECT THAT

02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:38.175
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RECOGNIZING

02:33:38.242 --> 02:33:40.444
THAT ALSO AND THAT'S WH YOU'RE

02:33:40.511 --> 02:33:41.645
SAYING FOCUSING ENERGY ON THE

02:33:41.712 --> 02:33:43.914
MOST VALUABLE USES OF SOMETHING

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:46.951
LIKE HYDROGEN- SO THAT WE CAN

02:33:47.017 --> 02:33:48.152
GET MOVING. AND THEN TURN AROUND

02:33:48.218 --> 02:33:51.989
AND- CONTINUE TO DO THE RESEARCH

02:33:52.056 --> 02:33:54.325
AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM COME

02:33:54.391 --> 02:33:55.459
FROM THERE MY CORRECTOR. THAT'S

02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:57.728
EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU VERY

02:33:57.795 --> 02:33:58.929
MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THANK

02:33:58.996 --> 02:34:03.133
YOU MADAM CHAIR. DO WE HAVE ANY

02:34:03.200 --> 02:34:04.969
OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISTER MAYOR

02:34:05.035 --> 02:34:09.740
CITY. THANK YOU I STAYING WITH

02:34:09.807 --> 02:34:13.444
THEM AS MCNAB ARE A- AND

02:34:13.510 --> 02:34:14.745
FOLLOWING MISTER BENNETT'S LINE

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:17.481
OF QUESTIONS- I WAS AT A RECENT

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:20.150
CONFERENCE WHERE- THE POTENTIAL

02:34:20.217 --> 02:34:22.052
FOR GREEN HYDROGEN NOT ONLY. AS

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:25.389
A- TRANSPORTATION FUEL BUT ALSO

02:34:25.456 --> 02:34:28.859
AS A FORM OF ENERGY STORAGE WAS

02:34:28.926 --> 02:34:31.362
DISCUSSED GREG GOOD COULD YOU

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:34.632
TALK ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW THE-

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:38.268
EFFECTIVENESS OF- GREEN HYDROGEN

02:34:38.335 --> 02:34:43.040
STORING. WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY.

02:34:43.107 --> 02:34:47.344
VERSES BATTERY STORAGE. THANK

02:34:47.411 --> 02:34:53.317
YOU I'M. HYDROGEN IS ARE LESS

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:55.119
EFFICIENT A STORAGE MECHANISM

02:34:55.185 --> 02:34:58.122
THAT BATTERY STORAGE HOWEVER IT

02:34:58.188 --> 02:34:59.556
DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:01.592
STORED AND LARGE VOLUMES AND FOR

02:35:01.659 --> 02:35:04.762
LONG PERIODS WHICH MEANS THAT IT

02:35:04.828 --> 02:35:06.930
IS UNLIKELY THAT HYDROGEN AND

02:35:06.997 --> 02:35:08.599
BATTERIES WILL GO HEAD TO HEAD

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:10.334
FOR THE SAME PURPOSE BUT IN THE

02:35:10.401 --> 02:35:13.404
POWER SECTOR BUT WE CAN IMAGINE

02:35:13.470 --> 02:35:15.572
PERHAPS FOR SEASONAL STORAGE

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:17.408
WHERE WE HAVE LARGE PRODUCTIONS

02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:20.711
RIGHT IT IS SAFE FOR SOLAR- BUT

02:35:20.778 --> 02:35:23.447
WE HAVE. OVERPRODUCTION AT

02:35:23.514 --> 02:35:25.449
CERTAIN PERIODS OF THE YEAR ARE

02:35:25.516 --> 02:35:27.084
WE CAN TURN THAT INTO HYDROGEN

02:35:27.151 --> 02:35:28.986
AND STORING AND THEN USED IT

02:35:29.053 --> 02:35:31.021
DURING PERIODS WHEN WE MAY HAVE

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:33.524
LESS RENEWABLE ABUNDANCE PROBLEM

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:37.261
AND THAT STAGE JUST WITHIN THE

02:35:37.327 --> 02:35:39.329
POWER SECTOR. OR IT CAN BE

02:35:39.396 --> 02:35:39.930
BROUGHT AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED

02:35:39.997 --> 02:35:41.799
TODAY ACROSS OTHER SECTORS AS A

02:35:41.865 --> 02:35:43.600
WAY TO TAKE THAT CLEAN

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:46.170
ELECTRICITY AND USABLE SQUARE.

02:35:46.236 --> 02:35:51.308
THANK YOU AND- IN IN TERMS OF-

02:35:51.375 --> 02:35:55.913
STATE INVESTMENTS ZERO EMISSION

02:35:55.979 --> 02:35:58.515
. VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE FUELING

02:35:58.582 --> 02:36:01.819
INFRASTRUCTURE- IN THE COMMITTEE

02:36:01.885 --> 02:36:03.721
REPORT THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT

02:36:03.787 --> 02:36:06.356
WAS SHARED FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS

02:36:06.423 --> 02:36:10.027
THERE IS A SUMMARY OF A RECENT

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:12.229
REPORT BY EARTH JUSTICE. THAT

02:36:12.296 --> 02:36:17.034
THAT FOCUSES ON YOU KNOW THE.

02:36:17.101 --> 02:36:19.136
THE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE

02:36:19.203 --> 02:36:23.240
SECTORS- LIKE LONG HAUL TRUCKS-

02:36:23.307 --> 02:36:26.510
BUT DISCOURAGING- INVESTMENTS-

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:30.848
AND OR OR THE USE OF HYDROGEN OF

02:36:30.914 --> 02:36:35.552
FOUR FOUR CARS AND BUSES- IT

02:36:35.619 --> 02:36:37.721
WOULDN'T WHICH YOU CAN CURRENT

02:36:37.788 --> 02:36:39.890
THAT AND IF SO. YOU KNOW IT

02:36:39.957 --> 02:36:42.226
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE STATE

02:36:42.292 --> 02:36:44.194
TO CONTINUE TO INVEST LIMITED

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:48.899
RESOURCES INTO- HYDROGENFUELING

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:50.634
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CARS AND

02:36:50.701 --> 02:36:55.806
BUSES. YEAH THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

02:36:55.873 --> 02:36:58.008
AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION ALLEN

02:36:58.075 --> 02:37:00.677
WE DON'T WE DO THINK THAT THERE

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.780
IS SOME ROLE ACROSS ALL THESE

02:37:02.846 --> 02:37:06.150
END USES ACROSS CARS AND BUSES

02:37:06.216 --> 02:37:08.085
REGIONAL TRUCKS AND SAID HERE.

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:11.155
AB BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT WE

02:37:11.221 --> 02:37:12.623
SHOULD WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE

02:37:12.689 --> 02:37:15.159
READILY AVAILABLE I HAVE DIRECT

02:37:15.225 --> 02:37:17.127
ELECTRIFICATION ALTERNATIVES

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:18.896
TODAY THAT ARE RAMPING WITH

02:37:18.962 --> 02:37:20.998
INCREDIBLE SPEED AND COST

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.933
EFFECTIVENESS SO WHEN WE THINK

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.169
ABOUT. HOW TO PURSUE THE FORWARD

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:28.105
COURSE WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING

02:37:28.172 --> 02:37:30.641
PRECLUDING THESE AS AS VIABLE

02:37:30.707 --> 02:37:32.743
TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE CERTAINLY

02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:35.245
DON'T THINK THAT INVESTMENTS

02:37:35.312 --> 02:37:37.080
SHOULD BE STALLED ON BEHALF.

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:39.416
RIGHT JUST WAITING FOR THEM TO

02:37:39.483 --> 02:37:42.352
CATCH UP. I'M WE THINK LIKELY

02:37:42.419 --> 02:37:43.687
MOST OF THESE WILL BE DISH

02:37:43.754 --> 02:37:45.823
APPLICATIONS THAT IT WILL BE A

02:37:45.889 --> 02:37:48.292
VERY SMALL SHARE VEHICLES THAT

02:37:48.358 --> 02:37:50.360
WILL BE LIKE TO BE A COSTS THAT

02:37:50.427 --> 02:37:53.230
WILL BE NITROGEN BUT THERE IS

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:54.798
THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERAL- AND

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:55.699
SO JUST THINKING ABOUT

02:37:55.766 --> 02:37:58.001
INVESTMENTS IN LINE WITH THAT

02:37:58.068 --> 02:38:05.175
BALANCING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:38:05.242 --> 02:38:05.943
DOES ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY

02:38:06.009 --> 02:38:08.011

MARKET AS WELL AS MAJOR HYDROGEN

02:39:11.141 --> 02:39:13.777
PRODUCERS- A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:15.979
ABOUT AMOUNTS AROUND A LOT SO

02:39:16.046 --> 02:39:18.515
I'M NUMBER ONE I WANTED TO

02:39:18.582 --> 02:39:20.117
FOLLOW UP TO THE DISCUSSION

02:39:20.183 --> 02:39:21.718
AROUND HYDROGEN LEAKAGE BY

02:39:21.785 --> 02:39:23.353
SHARING A QUOTE THAT COMES FROM

02:39:23.420 --> 02:39:24.788
THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE

HEALTH OF HUMANS OR WILDLIFE BUT

02:39:33.764 --> 02:39:34.731
FOSSIL FUELS COMPOSED

02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:35.899
SIGNIFICANT HEALTH AND

02:39:35.966 --> 02:39:37.634
ECOLOGICAL THREATS WHEN LEAKED.

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:39.903
SPILLED COMBUSTED THE EUROPEAN

02:39:39.970 --> 02:39:41.705
CAN COMMISSION EUROPEAN UNION

02:39:41.772 --> 02:39:43.707
HAS DONE AN ANALYSIS ON LEAKAGE

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.509
RATES AND SHOWS THAT IT IS

02:39:45.575 --> 02:39:47.244
NEGLIGIBLE AND I WILL ALSO POINT

02:39:47.311 --> 02:39:48.879
OUT THAT HYDROGEN IS NOT A

02:39:48.946 --> 02:39:50.380
GREENHOUSE GAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:39:50.447 --> 02:39:52.649
AT SU CHI YOU ASKED WONDERFUL

02:39:52.716 --> 02:39:53.183
QUESTIONS I WOULD REALLY

02:39:53.250 --> 02:39:54.451
RECOMMEND YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:56.520
ALAMEDA COUNTY FIVE BY FIVE

02:39:56.586 --> 02:39:58.989
ANALISIS WHICH WAS DONE. AROUND

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:03.293
THEIR. FLEET OF NATURAL GAS US-

02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:04.628
DIESEL BATTERY AND FUEL CELL

02:40:04.695 --> 02:40:06.730
ELECTRIC VEHICLE BUSES WHAT

02:40:06.797 --> 02:40:08.332
WE'RE MISSING IN THE DISCUSSION

02:40:08.398 --> 02:40:09.866
IS PERFORMANCE THAT SOMETHING

02:40:09.933 --> 02:40:11.368
THAT CANNOT BE SACRIFICED

02:40:11.435 --> 02:40:12.602
WHETHER YOU'RE TRANSIT DISTRICT

02:40:12.669 --> 02:40:14.438
OR WHETHER YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:15.739
WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT IN A

02:40:15.806 --> 02:40:18.742
MOMENT- SO. ARE A COUPLE OF

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:23.180
COMMENTS MY PAL- I LEFT BUT- WE

02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:24.448
WERE CHATTING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:40:24.514 --> 02:40:26.183
INCENTIVIZING PRODUCTION AND

02:40:26.249 --> 02:40:28.118
MAXIMIZING HOBBS WITH THE IG ME

02:40:28.185 --> 02:40:29.486
LEVIN. AND I WANTED TO

02:40:29.553 --> 02:40:30.721
UNDERSCORE EVERYTHING THAT HE

02:40:30.787 --> 02:40:32.823
SAID BUT REALLY BRING IT BACK TO

02:40:32.889 --> 02:40:34.758
SUPPORT FOR AND YOU SAYS WE HAVE

02:40:34.825 --> 02:40:36.893
THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO GROW AND

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.695
ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION

02:40:38.762 --> 02:40:40.497
TECHNOLOGY BUT WE NEED TO BE

02:40:40.564 --> 02:40:43.233
SUPPORTING AND YOU SAYS SO THREE

02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.634
HUNDRED MILLION TO FINISH LIGHT

02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:46.603
MEDIUM DUTY FUELING NETWORK. BUT

02:40:46.670 --> 02:40:49.539
I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT 62%

02:40:49.606 --> 02:40:50.907
OF THE TEN BILLION DOLLARS

02:40:50.974 --> 02:40:52.509
THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT IN THE LAST

02:40:52.576 --> 02:40:53.510
TWO YEARS FOR IS I'VE

02:40:53.577 --> 02:40:55.278
INFRASTRUCTURE. IS DEDICATED TO

02:40:55.345 --> 02:40:57.414
HEAVY DUTY SO I'D LIKE TO SEE

02:40:57.481 --> 02:40:59.616
LESS THAN THREE PERCENT. OF

02:40:59.683 --> 02:41:00.884
DOLLARS DIRECTED TOWARDS

02:41:00.951 --> 02:41:02.285
HYDROGEN WHICH IS HAPPENING

02:41:02.352 --> 02:41:03.920
RIGHT NOW INTERCEPT SPENDING AND

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:06.890
I FEEL LIKE THAT BUT AS IT WAS

02:41:06.957 --> 02:41:09.059
MEANT FOR ME IT WAS A- OKAY- SO

02:41:09.126 --> 02:41:10.627
WHAT'S- ONE CLOSING. COMMENT IF

02:41:10.694 --> 02:41:12.829
I MAY. A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:14.498
AROUND EFFICIENCY AND IT BEGS

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:16.500
THE QUESTION EFFICIENT FOR HILL

02:41:16.566 --> 02:41:17.567
EFFICIENT FOR THE TRANSIT

02:41:17.634 --> 02:41:19.236
DISTRICT THAT NEEDS TO HAVE

02:41:19.302 --> 02:41:21.104
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS.

02:41:21.171 --> 02:41:22.439
EFFICIENT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD THAT

02:41:22.506 --> 02:41:24.274
NEEDS TO HAVE IS YOUR MACHINE

02:41:24.341 --> 02:41:25.308
VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TAKE

02:41:25.375 --> 02:41:26.443
THEM WHERE THEY NEED TO GO I

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:28.445
WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE

02:41:28.512 --> 02:41:29.679
TO CONSIDER IT THE END USES THE

02:41:29.746 --> 02:41:30.881
END GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO

02:41:30.947 --> 02:41:32.482
TRANSITION FOLKS TO ZERO

02:41:32.549 --> 02:41:33.884
EMISSION VEHICLES THERE'S NO

02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:35.185
REASON IN THE WORLD TO

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:36.153
ARTIFICIALLY LIMIT THOSE AND

02:41:36.219 --> 02:41:38.422
USES. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I

02:41:38.488 --> 02:41:40.757
ONLY GIVE YOU MORE TIME BECAUSE

02:41:40.824 --> 02:41:41.391
YOU'RE SPEAKING FOR DOZENS OF

02:41:41.458 --> 02:41:43.326
COMPANIES SO I SORT OF ADDED

02:41:43.393 --> 02:41:44.428
THEM UP. BUT NOBODY ELSE IS

02:41:44.494 --> 02:41:46.997
GOING TO GET THAT SO YOU'RE

02:41:47.064 --> 02:41:47.697
LISTENING IT WAS THE LAST ONE SO

02:41:47.764 --> 02:41:48.832
NEXT A SPEAKER PLEASE MCHALE'S

02:41:48.899 --> 02:41:50.367
GROWTH WALKER PARA BEHALF OF

02:41:50.434 --> 02:41:53.370
LINDE PLC- WE REPRESENT- EVERY

02:41:53.437 --> 02:41:54.337
ASPECT OF THE HYDROGEN

02:41:54.404 --> 02:41:55.972
PRODUCTION VALUE CHAIN- FROM

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.874
PRODUCTION TO THE REFILLING.

02:41:57.941 --> 02:41:59.476
STATION INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:00.744
A LARGE PORTION OF THE

02:42:00.811 --> 02:42:02.279
LIQUEFACTION- THROUGHOUT THE

02:42:02.345 --> 02:42:05.782
STATE AND NATIONALLY- EARLY WE

02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.284
JUST RECENTLY ONE ELECTROLYZER

02:42:07.350 --> 02:42:09.186
WARD FROM THE C. C. AND WEBER

02:42:09.252 --> 02:42:11.021
VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT. WE'VE

02:42:11.088 --> 02:42:12.589
ALSO- DIRECTLY CONTROLLED BIO

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:14.825
GAS TO REFORM THAT TO- RENEWABLE

02:42:14.891 --> 02:42:16.693
HYDROGEN FOR THE DELIVERY TO THE

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:17.828
VEHICLE SPACE TODAY THAT THAT IS

02:42:17.894 --> 02:42:20.730
A- LOT LOWER THAN ELECTRICITY.

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:22.599
CARBON PATHWAY THAT WE SHOULD

02:42:22.666 --> 02:42:24.835
NOT PRECLUDE BECAUSE OF CARBON-

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:25.435
THE HIGH GLOBAL WARMING

02:42:25.502 --> 02:42:27.370
POTENTIAL OF. MISSIONS LIKE

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:28.805
METHANE BUT ALSO THERE'S OTHER

02:42:28.872 --> 02:42:30.273
INTERESTING PATHWAY SUCH AS

02:42:30.340 --> 02:42:31.541
BIOMASS. WHICH COULD HELP

02:42:31.608 --> 02:42:33.343
MITIGATE OUR WILDFIRE ISSUES

02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:34.644
THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA.

02:42:34.711 --> 02:42:36.513
SO WHAT WE WANNA URGES THAT WE

02:42:36.580 --> 02:42:38.248
CONTINUE TO KEEP AN OPEN MIND ON

02:42:38.315 --> 02:42:39.583
THE RENEWAL PATHWAYS JUST AS WE

02:42:39.649 --> 02:42:42.552
DO IN THE L. IN THE R. P. S. TO

02:42:42.619 --> 02:42:43.620
CONTINUE TO DECARBONISE HYDROGEN

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:45.856
GOING FORWARD- SECOND. THE

02:42:45.922 --> 02:42:46.890
NUMBERS A LOT NUMBERS BEING

02:42:46.957 --> 02:42:48.325
THROWN AROUND A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:50.026
TALKING IN WARNING ABOUT COST.

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:51.695
JUST WANNA LEAVE THIS WITH YOU.

02:42:51.761 --> 02:42:52.762
HYDROGEN ALSO TODAY IN A LIGHT

02:42:52.829 --> 02:42:54.698
DUTY STATION AND WE EXPECT BIG

02:42:54.764 --> 02:42:56.533
GREATER SPEED AT THE HEAVY DUTY

02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.001
STATIONS COMING FORWARD. IS FOUR

02:42:58.068 --> 02:42:59.102
TIMES GREATER THAN THE

02:42:59.169 --> 02:43:00.170
THEORETICAL ONE MEGAWATT

02:43:00.237 --> 02:43:02.405
CHARGER- THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED

02:43:02.472 --> 02:43:03.406
FOR THE HEAVY DUTY CHARGING

02:43:03.473 --> 02:43:04.875
SPACE. LIGHT DUTY HYDROGEN

02:43:04.941 --> 02:43:06.443
VEHICLES RECEIVED A FOUR

02:43:06.510 --> 02:43:07.611
MEGAWATT CHARGE ON EQUIVALENT

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:10.046
BASIS. AND WITH THE STATE

02:43:10.113 --> 02:43:11.014
REBATE. WE ARE DELIVERING TEN

02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:13.383
TIMES THE ENERGY TRANSFER AT 5%

02:43:13.450 --> 02:43:15.152
OF THE STATE REMAKE COST. PER

02:43:15.218 --> 02:43:17.320
KILOWATT. WE'RE JUST GETTING

02:43:17.387 --> 02:43:19.689
PERFECTION AND- TESTING THESE

02:43:19.756 --> 02:43:21.291
EQUIPMENT TODAY FIFTY IS NOT

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:22.792
ENOUGH TO CHIEF. KIND OF

02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:24.861
PROFICIENCY WORK WORK GET URGENT

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:26.796
A CONTINUED INVEST IN THE SPACE.

02:43:26.863 --> 02:43:28.298
BUT ALSO WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT

02:43:28.365 --> 02:43:30.433
FOR THAT WE DO THE SPACE IS A

02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:31.768
SPACE WHERE HYDROGEN WILL

02:43:31.835 --> 02:43:33.003
ABSOLUTELY. DOMINATE AND BRING

02:43:33.069 --> 02:43:34.571
ZERO MISSION TO IT YOU KNOW THE

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:35.639
COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED BY PORT

02:43:35.705 --> 02:43:37.374
TRAFFIC. AND UP AND DOWN OR

02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:38.875
TRANSPORTATION INFREQUENT OURS

02:43:38.942 --> 02:43:42.045
WITHOUT SACRIFICING WEIGHT. VMT

02:43:42.112 --> 02:43:43.813
MATTERS EFFICIENCY FREIGHT

02:43:43.880 --> 02:43:46.049
MOVEMENT MATTERS. THAT THERE ARE

02:43:46.116 --> 02:43:47.784
OTHER TYPES OF EFFICIENCY AZAR

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:49.886
IS ALSO PRODUCTIVITY WE MUST

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:51.288
MAINTAIN PRODUCTIVITY ESPECIALLY

02:43:51.354 --> 02:43:53.089
IN THIS COMMERCIAL PACES. SO TO

02:43:53.156 --> 02:43:54.691
THAT END- WE'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP

02:43:54.758 --> 02:43:56.493
WITH SOME SOME MORE MATH SO YOU

02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.395
GUYS CAN SEE THE NUMBERS BUT-

02:43:58.461 --> 02:43:59.396
THE PREVIOUS TIME. THANK YOU AND

02:43:59.462 --> 02:44:01.464
I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE HERE IN

02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:02.592
WEBSITE. OKAY NEXT CALLER PLEASE

02:45:02.659 --> 02:45:04.327
. THANK YOU AND WE WILL PER LINE

02:45:04.394 --> 02:45:07.030
UP BY EIGHTY TWO YOUR LINE IS

02:45:07.097 --> 02:45:09.766
OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ONE EIGHTY

02:45:09.833 --> 02:45:11.568
TWO I FIND IT FASCINATING THAT

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:14.337
SAMA TESTIMONY IS EXTENDED WHILE

02:45:14.404 --> 02:45:16.506
OTHER TESTIMONY TENDS TO BE

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:19.009
CURTAILED. THAT BEING SAID

02:45:19.075 --> 02:45:20.944
READING FROM A FORBES ARTICLE

02:45:21.011 --> 02:45:24.147
ABOUT WHY ARE WE STILL TALKING

02:45:24.214 --> 02:45:26.683
ABOUT HYDROGEN. ON THE SURFACE

02:45:26.750 --> 02:45:28.451
HYDROGEN SOUNDS LIKE A WONDERFUL

02:45:28.518 --> 02:45:35.225
FUEL. TO WATER WHICH IS HARDLY

02:45:35.292 --> 02:45:37.127
GOING TO DESTROY THE ATMOSPHERE

02:45:37.193 --> 02:45:39.029
WHAT REALLY WHAT REALLY APPEALS

02:45:39.095 --> 02:45:40.497
TO PEOPLE IS THE FACT THAT YOU

02:45:40.563 --> 02:45:42.232
CAN REFUEL HYDROGEN FUEL CELL

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:44.634
VEHICLE AND THE SAME KIND OF WAY

02:45:44.701 --> 02:45:46.603
OF THE FOSSIL FUEL CAR. NO

02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:48.638
LIFESTYLE CHANGES ARE NECESSARY

02:45:48.705 --> 02:45:50.707
YOUR CAR WILL HAVE A COMPLETELY

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:51.975
DIFFERENT ENGINE INSIDE BUT

02:45:52.042 --> 02:45:53.943
UNLESS YOU ENJOY TINKERING WITH

02:45:54.010 --> 02:45:56.713
ITS MECHANICALS YOU WON'T NOTICE

02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:58.581
FROM DAY TODAY YOU CAN JUST HEAD

02:45:58.648 --> 02:46:00.517
TO A FUEL STATION WHEN YOU NEED.

02:46:00.583 --> 02:46:02.652
A FIVE MINUTE POP UP JUST LIKE

02:46:02.719 --> 02:46:05.155
THE GOOD OLD DAYS HYDROGEN'S

02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:07.657
INHERENT FLAW THE PROBLEM IS

02:46:07.724 --> 02:46:09.526
THAT THIS CONVENIENCE HIDES A

02:46:09.592 --> 02:46:10.827
SIGNIFICANT FLAW IN THE

02:46:10.894 --> 02:46:12.562
TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS SOMEHOW

02:46:12.629 --> 02:46:14.364
FAILED. TO BE INCLUDED IN THE

02:46:14.431 --> 02:46:17.534
MARKETING PROPAGANDA OF HYDROGEN

02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:19.169
AND VANGELIS. IT DOESN'T APPEAR

02:46:19.235 --> 02:46:21.204
TO BE WIDELY UNDERSTOOD BY THOSE

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:22.772
WHO HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE

02:46:22.839 --> 02:46:24.174
MESSAGES EITHER THE FILE IS

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:26.943
BASICALLY BECAUSE BUT A LOT OF

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:28.611
PHYSICS. FOR HYDROGEN TO BE

02:46:28.678 --> 02:46:29.646
COMPLETELY GREEN AND MUST BE

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.281
PRODUCED BY ELECTROLYTE AND

02:46:31.348 --> 02:46:33.683
WATER WHICH SPLITS THIS INTO THE

02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:36.186
H. TWO AND O. THAT IS MADE OF.

02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:37.721
YOU CAN PRODUCE H. TWO FROM

02:46:37.787 --> 02:46:40.757
COPPELL FUEL YOU USUALLY METHANE

02:46:40.824 --> 02:46:43.026
BUT THIS CREATES EITHER GRAY

02:46:43.093 --> 02:46:44.260
HYDROGEN WHICH STILL PRODUCES A

02:46:44.327 --> 02:46:46.930
LOT OF CO TWO OR BLUE HYDROGEN

02:46:46.996 --> 02:46:50.133
WHICH CAPTURES 90% OF THE CO TWO

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:51.468
AND STORE THAT MERELY DELAYING

02:46:51.534 --> 02:46:53.470
THE PROBLEM. ONLY ELECTROLYTES

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:56.373
ZING HYDROGEN FROM WATER USUALLY

02:46:56.439 --> 02:46:58.007
USING ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM

02:46:58.074 --> 02:47:00.944
RENEWABLE SOURCES MAKES THE FEEL

02:47:01.010 --> 02:47:03.480
ENTIRELY GREEN. THIS IS AN

02:47:03.546 --> 02:47:05.582
INEFFICIENT SYSTEM THAT WASTES

02:47:05.648 --> 02:47:07.851
ENERGY AND I COULD GO ON AND ON

02:47:07.917 --> 02:47:09.185
EVEN AS THE COLLAPSE

02:47:09.252 --> 02:47:11.154
SUPERMAJORITY DIDN'T SUSPEND THE

02:47:11.221 --> 02:47:14.224
GAS TAX TODAY. AND YOU PEOPLE

02:47:14.290 --> 02:47:16.526
ARE SETTING UP THEIR PONTIFICATE

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:20.697

AS YOU HEARD FROM COMMISSIONER

02:49:23.019 --> 02:49:24.821
HOOK SHIELD THE COST TO BRING

02:49:24.888 --> 02:49:25.822
HYDROGEN ITS POTENTIALLY MORE

02:49:25.889 --> 02:49:27.790
THAN GRAY OR BLUE HYDROGEN.

02:49:27.857 --> 02:49:29.359
UNIVERSAL HYDROGEN IS COMMITTING

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:31.160
TO USING GREEN HYDROGEN BUT TO

02:49:31.227 --> 02:49:32.562
MAKE THAT FEASIBLE THERE NEEDS

02:49:32.629 --> 02:49:33.930
TO BE MORE PRODUCTION AND THE

02:49:33.997 --> 02:49:35.999
COST OF GREEN HYDROGEN MUST COME

02:49:36.065 --> 02:49:37.433
DOWN IF THE STATE IS COMMITTED

02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.468
TO GREEN HYDROGEN OVER OTHER

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:40.737
TYPES OF HYDROGEN THEY NEED TO

02:49:40.803 --> 02:49:41.704
BE INCENTIVES OR SUBSIDIES TO

SCALE REALLY GET THE METRICS OF

02:50:53.109 --> 02:50:53.843
HOW TO RETURN THE HARMONIZATION

02:50:53.910 --> 02:50:56.713
GOALS- WE WOULD SUPPORT THAT

02:50:56.779 --> 02:50:57.914
METHOD GOING FORWARD WITH ALL

02:50:57.981 --> 02:50:58.815
EXPANSION OF HYDROGEN

02:50:58.881 --> 02:51:01.351
ELIGIBILITY. FURTHER WE REALLY

02:51:01.417 --> 02:51:03.186
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:04.387
THAT. YOU KNOW A HUGE DISCUSSION

02:51:04.454 --> 02:51:06.456
FOR HYDROGEN HEAVY DUTY WE HAVE

02:51:06.522 --> 02:51:07.724
SO MANY HAVING TO REMEMBER THE

02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:09.459
WE SUPPORT AS WELL HOW DID YOU

02:51:09.525 --> 02:51:10.927
END UP AT THE STATE. AMENITY

02:51:10.994 --> 02:51:12.629
SECTOR BUT ALSO THE STATE LIKE

02:51:12.695 --> 02:51:14.297
ANY FACTOR WE REALLY CAN'T WRAP

02:51:14.364 --> 02:51:15.999
MY HEAD AROUND THE FACT THAT

02:51:16.065 --> 02:51:17.567
MANY OF THE CARDS THAT ARE

02:51:17.634 --> 02:51:19.035
PLUGGING INTO THE GRID BECAUSE

02:51:19.102 --> 02:51:20.770
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE DO PLUGINS.

02:51:20.837 --> 02:51:21.671
ARE CUTTING INTEGRATED IS ON

02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:23.306
AVERAGE ABOUT 33% RENEWABLE

02:51:23.373 --> 02:51:25.041
WHEREAS ALL OF THE STATIONS THAT

02:51:25.108 --> 02:51:26.709
ARE PART OF LOW CARBON FUEL

02:51:26.776 --> 02:51:28.711
STANDARD BESIDES. SEVEN OR EIGHT

02:51:28.778 --> 02:51:30.046
ARE IN OPERATION SO ALL OF

02:51:30.113 --> 02:51:31.347
CALIFORNIA'S HYDROGEN FILLING

02:51:31.414 --> 02:51:33.916
STATIONS ARE ABOUT 90% RENEWABLE

02:51:33.983 --> 02:51:35.652
ARE HIGHER AND I THINK OF THE

02:51:35.718 --> 02:51:36.786
BABY REPORT THAT WAS PRODUCED

02:51:36.853 --> 02:51:38.554
FROM CARD ITSELF. I DON'T REALLY

02:51:38.621 --> 02:51:49.465
UNDERSTAND. THIS LARGE

02:51:49.532 --> 02:51:51.367
CONFERENCE FOR. ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:51:51.434 --> 02:51:53.036
THAT'S HARD. ON A GRID THAT UP

02:51:53.102 --> 02:51:53.870
30% AS COMPARED TO THE- FUEL

02:51:53.936 --> 02:51:55.738
STATION. THAT ARE MATURE NINETY

02:51:55.805 --> 02:51:56.873
PER MIDDLE OR HIGH. WHAT KIND OF

02:51:56.939 --> 02:51:58.474
A WINNER LOSER HERE WE JUST

02:51:58.541 --> 02:51:59.809
JERRY AND- YOUR TO PARITY IN

02:51:59.876 --> 02:52:02.679
ADDRESSING THAT THE IS THE AND-

02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:04.280
HOW TO RELATE TO GETTING RIGHT

02:52:04.347 --> 02:52:05.682
INFO. FOR YOUR MUCH VEHICLES.

02:52:05.748 --> 02:52:06.883
ARE GOING FOR. WHICH IS REALLY A

02:52:06.949 --> 02:52:08.518
HER. CLICK TELL YOU DISCUSSION

02:52:08.584 --> 02:52:09.619
AND NOT TO ONE OR THE THERE'S

02:52:09.686 --> 02:52:11.788
LIKE HEALTH CAN'T ABOUT THREE

02:52:11.854 --> 02:52:12.388
FOURTHS. THIRTY CREDIT. THANK

02:52:12.455 --> 02:52:16.926
YOU YOUR TIME IS. UP NEXT CALLER

02:52:16.993 --> 02:52:18.461
PLEASE. GET A COMPROMISE SEVENTY

02:52:18.528 --> 02:52:21.764
YEAR IS OPEN. MMHM GOOD EVENING

02:52:21.831 --> 02:52:23.366
GOOD AFTERNOON OF MEMBERS OF THE

02:52:23.433 --> 02:52:25.702
COMMITTEE AND CHAIR- MY NAME IS

02:52:25.768 --> 02:52:27.537
STEVE ROSENBLOOM ON A RESIDENT

02:52:27.603 --> 02:52:29.539
OF PALO ALTO AND I THANK YOU

02:52:29.605 --> 02:52:30.973
VERY MUCH FOR AN INTERESTING

02:52:31.040 --> 02:52:32.108
PROCESS THOSE SORT OF

02:52:32.175 --> 02:52:33.676
INTERESTING PRESENTATIONS ON.

02:52:33.743 --> 02:52:35.945
HYDROGEN AND IN OUR- FUTURE

02:52:36.012 --> 02:52:38.781
ECONOMY- I'D LIKE TO REFOCUS

02:52:38.848 --> 02:52:39.749
YOUR ATTENTION BACK ON THE

02:52:39.816 --> 02:52:41.217
PRODUCTION AND THAT WAS

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:42.785
DISCUSSED IN DETAIL BY CHAIR

02:52:42.852 --> 02:52:45.955
HOPE SHE'LL. AND MISTER SIEGEL

02:52:46.022 --> 02:52:49.392
OF CARBON- AS WE ARE CHAIR HOPE

02:52:49.459 --> 02:52:50.893
YOU POINTED OUT THE CHEAPEST

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:54.197
HYDROGEN IS MADE BY STEAM

02:52:54.263 --> 02:52:55.331
REFORMING OF METHANE. BUT THAT

02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:57.300
HAS A VERY HIGH CARBON INTENSITY

02:52:57.366 --> 02:52:59.836
AND I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS THE

02:52:59.902 --> 02:53:02.338
PRODUCTION END OF THE PROCESS ON

02:53:02.405 --> 02:53:04.941
CARBON INTENSITY AS THE S THE-

02:53:05.007 --> 02:53:07.210
MAIN QUALIFICATION BECAUSE IF WE

02:53:07.276 --> 02:53:09.112
WANT TO GET THE ZERO CARBON. NOW

02:53:09.178 --> 02:53:10.880
WE WANT TO SAVE OUR CLIMATE THAT

02:53:10.947 --> 02:53:14.884
HAS TO BE THE KEY METRIC- IF YOU

02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:16.552
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS I HAVE

02:53:16.619 --> 02:53:18.421
THERE'S A LOT OF DATA ON THIS

02:53:18.488 --> 02:53:19.756
BUT- IT'S NOT AND YOU KNOW DO

02:53:19.822 --> 02:53:21.424
NOT DOWN TO THE SINGLE DIGT

02:53:21.491 --> 02:53:24.427
ACCURACY BUT- IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:53:24.494 --> 02:53:25.461
KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE

02:53:25.528 --> 02:53:27.730
EQUIVALENT PER KILOGRAM OF

02:53:27.797 --> 02:53:29.599
HYDROGEN PRODUCED. IN REFORMING

02:53:29.665 --> 02:53:32.335
OF METHANE PRODUCES ABOUT TWELVE

02:53:32.401 --> 02:53:33.936
KILOGRAMS OF CARBON DIOXIDE

02:53:34.003 --> 02:53:36.639
EQUIVALENT. STEAM REFORMING WITH

02:53:36.706 --> 02:53:39.942
CARBON CAPTURE IS IN THERE TWO

02:53:40.009 --> 02:53:41.978
TO THREE KILOGRAM RANGE AND-

02:53:42.044 --> 02:53:44.213
PRODUCTION BY ELECTROLYSIS OF

02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:46.983
WATER IS IN APPROXIMATELY THE

02:53:47.049 --> 02:53:49.385
ONE OR LESS KILOGRAM. ABOUT

02:53:49.452 --> 02:53:51.220
CARBON DIOXIDE EQUIVALENT RANGE.

02:53:51.287 --> 02:53:54.390
SO WE IN ORDER TO GET. TO THE

02:53:54.457 --> 02:53:56.092
LOWEST POSSIBLE CARBON EMISSION

02:53:56.159 --> 02:53:58.027
WE REALLY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE.

02:53:58.094 --> 02:54:00.763
ON ON THE ELECTROLYSIS END OF

02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:04.000
THE SPECTRUM FOR ALL ALL NEW

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:05.301
INVESTMENTS. AND I THINK THAT

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:06.602
HAS TO BE THE KEY THE KEY

02:54:06.669 --> 02:54:10.373
QUALIFIER. AND I THINK AS CHAIR

02:54:10.439 --> 02:54:12.742
FRIEDMAN ALLUDED TO. IT DURING

02:54:12.809 --> 02:54:14.877
THE PRODUCTION PROCESS WHICH

02:54:14.944 --> 02:54:16.279
INCLUDES THAT WHAT WE CALL

02:54:16.345 --> 02:54:18.781
SCOPES ONE AND TWO. OF THE-

02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:22.118
CARBON EMISSIONS PROCESS- THAT

02:54:22.185 --> 02:54:23.386
THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE

02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:25.054
MISSIONS OCCUR BUT IN SCOPE

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:26.556
THREE WHERE THE END USER USES

02:54:26.622 --> 02:54:27.523
THAT THERE COULD ALSO BE

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:29.625
INVOLVED. SO IT'S UNIQUE BUT I

02:54:29.692 --> 02:54:30.459
REJECT WHICH NEED TO BE

02:54:30.526 --> 02:54:32.128
CONSIDERED THANK YOU THANK YOU

02:54:32.195 --> 02:54:38.167
SO MUCH- NEXT CALLER PLEASE.

02:54:38.234 --> 02:54:39.535
THANK YOU THAT ARE FROM NINE

02:54:39.602 --> 02:54:41.103
SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR LINE IS- OPEN

02:54:41.170 --> 02:54:42.338
PLEASE AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON

02:54:42.405 --> 02:54:43.606
JULIA LEVINS WITH A VIOLENT OR

02:54:43.673 --> 02:54:45.441
TO YOUR SITUATION A CALIFORNIA I

02:54:45.508 --> 02:54:47.476
WANT TO THANK BOTH COMMITTEES.

02:54:47.543 --> 02:54:48.611
FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING HOW

02:54:48.678 --> 02:54:50.012
BEEN REALLY INFORMATIVE AND IT'S

02:54:50.079 --> 02:54:51.380
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.616
CALIFORNIA- TO TACKLE THE ROLE

02:54:53.683 --> 02:54:56.485
OF HYDROGEN IN DECARBONIZING OUR

02:54:56.552 --> 02:54:58.487
ENERGY FACTOR. WE STRONGLY

02:54:58.554 --> 02:55:00.122
SUPPORT THE COMMENTS MADE BY

02:55:00.189 --> 02:55:01.858
MCNAMARA FROM THE CONCERNED HIGH

02:55:01.924 --> 02:55:04.227
HAS. AIRPORT REPRESENTED AND

02:55:04.293 --> 02:55:05.928
SEVERAL OTHERS THAT IT'S VERY

02:55:05.995 --> 02:55:07.663
IMPORTANT THE CALIFORNIA LOOK AT

02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:09.131
GREEN HYDROGEN OVER RENEWABLE

02:55:09.198 --> 02:55:12.101
HYDROGEN LIFE CYCLE BASIS. NOT

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:14.036
JUST LOOK AT THE EMISSIONS FROM

02:55:14.103 --> 02:55:15.571
ONE PART OF THE PRODUCTION

02:55:15.638 --> 02:55:17.740
PROCESS BUT- THE ENTIRE WELL TO

02:55:17.807 --> 02:55:20.443
WHEELS WELL TO. WHATEVER THAT'S

02:55:20.509 --> 02:55:22.345
THE WHOLE LIFE CYCLE BASIS. AND

02:55:22.411 --> 02:55:24.313
I THINK- THE REASON THIS IS

02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.182
IMPORTANT WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE

02:55:26.249 --> 02:55:28.517
AIRPORT PRESENTATION THE AIRPORT

02:55:28.584 --> 02:55:30.519
FLIGHT NUMBER FOUR I REALLY URGE

02:55:30.586 --> 02:55:32.288
ALL OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON

02:55:32.355 --> 02:55:33.522
THE OTHER LISTENERS. TO TAKE

02:55:33.589 --> 02:55:34.690
ANOTHER LOOK AT FIVE NUMBER

02:55:34.757 --> 02:55:36.125
FORCING AIR RESOURCES BOARD

02:55:36.192 --> 02:55:37.827
WHICH WHICH SHOWS A VERY WIDE

02:55:37.894 --> 02:55:39.695
RANGE OF LIFE CYCLE CARBON

02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:41.831
INTENSITY FOR DIFFERENT SOURCES.

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:43.165
IT ALSO UNDERSCORES THAT THE

02:55:43.232 --> 02:55:45.067
ONLY FORM OF HYDROGEN THAT CAN

02:55:45.134 --> 02:55:46.669
ACTUALLY BE CARBON NEGATIVE.

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:48.304
HYDROGEN THAT IS GENERATED FROM

02:55:48.371 --> 02:55:50.006
ORGANIC WASTE. AND THAT'S

02:55:50.072 --> 02:55:51.407
BECAUSE IT THAT CAN HELP TO

02:55:51.474 --> 02:55:53.542
REDUCE METHANE EMISSIONS- THAT

02:55:53.609 --> 02:55:54.777
WOULD OTHERWISE BE RELEASED BY

02:55:54.844 --> 02:55:56.879
LANDFILLS OR BLACK CARBON

02:55:56.946 --> 02:55:57.914
EMISSIONS IT WOULD EITHER BY

02:55:57.980 --> 02:55:59.348
OTHERWISE BE RELEASED ON THE

02:55:59.415 --> 02:56:00.583
OPEN BURNING OF AGRICULTURAL A

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:02.752
FOREST WASTE. WHEN YOU CONVERT

02:56:02.818 --> 02:56:03.986
THAT ORGANIC WASTE TO HYDROGEN

02:56:04.053 --> 02:56:09.091
INSTEAD YOU CAN PROVIDE CARBON.

02:56:09.158 --> 02:56:10.126
NEGATIVE POWER. CAN ORGANICALLY

02:56:10.192 --> 02:56:11.460
TOO HIGH IS ALSO WAITING REDUCE

02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:12.528
SHORT LIVED POLLUTANT

02:56:12.595 --> 02:56:13.796
COUNTERFEITING THE MANSION SHE'D

02:56:13.863 --> 02:56:15.932
BEEN AT THE KLASKO CONFERENCE. I

02:56:15.998 --> 02:56:16.399
THINK THAT CONFERENCE

02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:18.567
UNDERSCORED VERY VERY STRONGLY

02:56:18.634 --> 02:56:19.802
THAT THE MOST URGENT THING WE

02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:21.604
CAN DO TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

02:56:21.671 --> 02:56:22.405
CHANGES TO REDUCE SHORT LIVED

02:56:22.471 --> 02:56:23.706
CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. IT IS THE

02:56:23.773 --> 02:56:24.774
ONLY THING THAT ACTUALLY

02:56:24.840 --> 02:56:27.710
BENEFITS THE CLIMATE RIGHT AWAY

02:56:27.777 --> 02:56:28.611
AND AT SCALE. BOTH PRESIDENT

NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM SHE-

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:32.882
SAID THAT THE MOST URGENT THING

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.784
YOU CAN DO IN THE NEXT TEN TO

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:35.985
TWENTY FIVE YEARS. TO ADDRESS

02:56:36.052 --> 02:56:37.353
CLIMATE CHANGE IS TO REDUCE

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:38.421
SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS

02:56:38.487 --> 02:56:40.489
SHOW. ME TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

02:56:40.556 --> 02:56:42.925
NUMBER ONE. OUR DEFINITION BASED

02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:44.994
ON LIFE CYCLE EMISSIONS. AND

02:56:45.061 --> 02:56:46.462
NUMBER TWO ORGANIC WASTE SHOULD

02:56:46.529 --> 02:56:47.797
BE INCLUDED AS AN ELIGIBLE

02:56:47.863 --> 02:56:48.698

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:39.548
OPPORTUNITIES COMPETING FOR

02:57:39.615 --> 02:57:40.983
INVESTMENT WE DEVELOP AN

02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:43.119
OBJECTIVE VIEW OF MARKETS AND

02:57:43.185 --> 02:57:45.254
CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. FOR WHOM EACH

TECHNOLOGY IS AND WILL WORK WELL

02:57:48.657 --> 02:57:49.825
SO FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE MAY I

02:57:49.892 --> 02:57:51.460
PLEASE SUGGEST THREE POINTS FOR

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:52.995
YOUR CONSIDERATION FIRST THE

02:57:53.062 --> 02:57:54.397
OPENING FRAME IN THE BACKGROUND

02:57:54.463 --> 02:57:56.499
PAPER NEEDS APPROPRIATE CARE

02:57:56.565 --> 02:57:58.567
PARAPHRASING. TO FOCUS ON THE

02:58:06.008 --> 02:58:07.543
COST EFFECTIVE AND AVAILABLE

02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:09.812
WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY IF SOLAR

02:58:09.879 --> 02:58:12.415
PANELS AND BEV'S HAD THIS

02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:13.983
APPROACH TWENTY TWENTY YEARS

02:58:14.050 --> 02:58:15.551
AGO. THERE'S NOW A TREMENDOUS

02:58:15.618 --> 02:58:16.886
PACE OF PROGRESS IN HYDROGEN

02:58:16.952 --> 02:58:18.687

03:04:32.461 --> 03:04:33.796
NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF HYDROGEN

03:04:33.862 --> 03:04:35.831
CARS ON THE ROAD. SO IT'S REALLY

03:04:35.898 --> 03:04:36.932
TIME TO STOP SANCTIONING

03:04:36.999 --> 03:04:38.500
ADDITIONAL PUBLIC INVESTMENT.

03:04:38.567 --> 03:04:39.735
TOWARD THIS VASTLY UNDER

03:04:39.802 --> 03:04:41.503
UTILIZED FUELING NETWORK. GIVEN

03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:43.505
THAT WERE FAR OFF TRACK BUILDING

03:04:43.572 --> 03:04:45.140
ENOUGH CHARGING STATIONS TO KEEP

03:04:45.207 --> 03:04:47.309
UP WITH THE SURGING DVDFAB. AND

03:04:47.376 --> 03:04:48.977
ALMOST ALL THE HYDROGEN WE

03:04:49.044 --> 03:04:50.512
DISPENSED A THOUGHTFUL DERIVED.

03:04:50.579 --> 03:04:52.181
AND THE CLEAN THE LTFS SHIFTED

03:04:52.247 --> 03:04:53.715
UP TOWARDS RENEWABLE HYDROGEN IS

03:04:53.782 --> 03:04:55.584
DEMONSTRABLY FALSE. VIRTUALLY

03:04:55.651 --> 03:04:57.152
ALL OF THE HYGIENIC CALIFORNIA

03:04:57.219 --> 03:04:59.121
THAT'S CLAIMED TO BE RENEWABLE.

03:04:59.188 --> 03:05:00.255
COMES FROM POSSIBLE DRUG CHARGES

03:05:00.322 --> 03:05:02.491
CHEN SHARED WITH THE PURCHASE OF

03:05:02.558 --> 03:05:03.959
BIO GAS CREDIT. IT'S NOT EVEN

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:05.861
PRODUCE FROM ACTUAL BIOGAS IT'S

03:05:05.928 --> 03:05:07.763
JUST FROM BOTTLE GOD. WITH THE

03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:09.498
COUPLING OF CREDITS LANDFILLS IN

03:05:09.565 --> 03:05:14.770
INDIANA. OR FACTORY FARMS IN

03:05:14.837 --> 03:05:15.404
MISSISSIPPI. AND IT'S NOT JUST

03:05:15.471 --> 03:05:16.738
CARD THAT ARE ID. BATTERY

03:05:16.805 --> 03:05:17.606
ELECTRIC TRUCKS ARE UNDERSTOOD

03:05:17.673 --> 03:05:18.907
BE THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.542
TASK. TO DECARBONISE ALMOST ALL

03:05:20.609 --> 03:05:23.111
OF ROAD TRANSPORT. PERSONAL 80%

03:05:23.178 --> 03:05:24.613
OF TRUCKS RUN LESS THAN ONE

03:05:24.680 --> 03:05:25.681
HUNDRED MILES WHICH IS EASILY

03:05:25.747 --> 03:05:27.249
ACHIEVABLE FOR BATTERY TRUCKS.

03:05:27.316 --> 03:05:28.951
THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE MARKET

03:05:29.017 --> 03:05:30.886

MAKING CERTAIN THE INVESTMENT

03:06:08.357 --> 03:06:09.525
FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN THE

03:06:09.591 --> 03:06:11.460
INTEREST IN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY

03:06:11.527 --> 03:06:13.762
AND- TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE

03:06:13.829 --> 03:06:14.796
BEST PATH FORWARD TO

03:06:14.863 --> 03:06:15.797
DECARBONISING. OF NOT JUST A%

03:06:15.864 --> 03:06:17.299
TRANSPORTATION BUT ANYTHING THAT

03:06:17.366 --> 03:06:19.167
IS PRODUCING CARBON IT'S AT ADD

03:06:19.234 --> 03:06:21.537
IN MASS AMOUNTS- IT VARIOUS

03:06:21.603 --> 03:06:22.838

ONES- THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU

03:06:26.742 --> 03:06:28.076
KNOW WE'RE WE SEE THE VOLATILITY

03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:29.411
OF GAS PRICES WE SEE THE

03:06:29.478 --> 03:06:31.947
CONNECTION BETWEEN- AND IT'S-

03:06:32.014 --> 03:06:33.015
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

03:06:33.081 --> 03:06:36.084
NEW BUT THE- THE CONNECTION

03:06:36.151 --> 03:06:38.587
BETWEEN. REALLY BAD- ACTORS

03:06:38.654 --> 03:06:40.622
AROUND THE GLOBE- IN THE OIL

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:42.491
INDUSTRY AND THE CONNECTION TO

03:06:42.558 --> 03:06:43.592
GAS PRICES HERE AT HOME EVERY

03:06:43.659 --> 03:06:46.695
TIME- WE ENTER INTO ANY KIND OF

03:06:46.762 --> 03:06:49.097
A- FRIGHTENING GEOPOLITICAL.

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:50.198
EVENTS LIKES HAPPENING RIGHT

03:06:50.265 --> 03:06:52.467
NOW. A WE NEED TO HAVE ENERGY

03:06:52.534 --> 03:06:53.702
INDEPENDENCE AND THAT NEEDS TO

03:06:53.769 --> 03:06:55.470
BE CLEAN ENERGY IT CANNOT BE

03:06:55.537 --> 03:06:57.406
FOSSIL FUELS IT'S GOT TO BE.

03:06:57.472 --> 03:06:59.975
ZERO EMISSION FUELS. AND SO I

03:07:00.042 --> 03:07:01.276
THINK THAT THIS IS AN EXCITING

03:07:01.343 --> 03:07:03.345
AREA BUT ONE OF COURSE THAT WE

NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT AS WE

03:07:04.713 --> 03:07:06.248
MOVE INTO IT WE DON'T JUST

03:07:06.315 --> 03:07:07.316
REPLACE ONE POLLUTING FUEL WITH

03:07:07.382 --> 03:07:09.284
ANOTHER- SO THERE'S A LOT OF

03:07:09.351 --> 03:07:10.953
POTENTIAL HERE BUT YOU KNOW

03:07:11.019 --> 03:07:12.354
WE'RE CALIFORNIA AND IF WE DO

03:07:12.421 --> 03:07:13.322
HYDROGEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

03:07:13.388 --> 03:07:15.457
RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THESE

03:07:15.524 --> 03:07:16.758
