I THINK YOU RAISE SOME EXCELLENT

00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:54.332
POINTS IN THIS RESOLUTION AND I

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.266
DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:56.300
DISAGREE THAT THE CURRENT

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.769
SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:33:59.404
IN NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT I

00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.937
DO THINK IT'S AN

00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:01.672
OVERSIMPLIFICATION TO SAY THAT

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:02.974
CONGRESS IS UNWILLING TO ACT I

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.709
MEAN I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:05.376
THERE ARE.

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:07.545
DEEP PHILOSOPHICAL DIVIDES AND

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:09.914
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT WHAT SHOULD

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.616
BE DONE ABOUT THAT SITUATION.

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:13.017
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY CLEAR AT

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:14.652
I HOPE EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:15.653
WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.022
IMMIGRATION REFORM AND YOU TAKE

00:34:18.089 --> 00:34:18.623
A HOLISTIC LOOK AT THE ENTIRE

00:34:18.689 --> 00:34:21.626
SYSTEM -- YOU KNOW HAVING SAID

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:23.761
THAT I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE WARY OF

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:25.530
RESOLUTIONS THAT.

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:27.165
CALL ON CONGRESS TO DO THIS --

00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:28.566
URGED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:30.668
THAT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:31.969
CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:33.070
CONGRESS PEOPLE THAT WE WORK

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:34.338
WITH AND WHEN WE WANT TO URGE

00:34:34.405 --> 00:34:35.773
CONGRESS TO DO SOMETHING WE PICK

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.141
UP THE PHONE AND WE TALKED TO

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:37.341
THEM.

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:38.643
SO BY DEFINITION OF WE PASSED A

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:39.944
RESOLUTION IT'S NOT URGING

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.813
CONGRESS IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:43.514
A POLITICAL STATEMENT IT'S NOT A

00:34:43.581 --> 00:34:44.315
A SOMETHING THAT THAT'S SUPPOSED

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.716
TO BE A LEGITIMATE LEGISLATIVE

00:34:45.783 --> 00:34:48.019
TOOL. FOR US SO I'M ALWAYS A

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:50.721
LITTLE WARY OF THAT -- IN AND

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:52.023
JUST SAY ONE MORE THING -- THIS

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:52.590
IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:53.658
BECAUSE I THINK COULD BE A

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:56.494
BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND I I'D LIKE

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:57.829

TUNING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.633
BECAUSE IF WE DID IT IN A WAY

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:03.401
THAT CALLS ATTENTION TO THE

00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.302
ISSUE.

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:05.570
AND NOT A WAY THAT CRITICIZES

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.071
THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION I

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.808
THINK IT COULD BE BIPARTISAN BUT

00:35:10.875 --> 00:35:11.409
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.144

OTHER STATES TO JOIN US WITH

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:41.405
THIS IS THAT IT'S NOT AN

INDIVIDUAL REQUEST IT IS IN FACT

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:44.475

00:36:05.596 --> 00:36:06.697
NINE ELEVEN AND IT COSTS THIS

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.099
THE DREAM ACT ACTUALLY BE PUT ON

CONTINUED TO BE AN ISSUE THAT

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:15.473

BUT IT'S ENOUGH TIME HAS PASSED

00:36:20.678 --> 00:36:22.480
AND TO YOUR POINT WE DO NEED TO

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:24.048
