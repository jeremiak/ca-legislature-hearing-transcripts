NEWPORT BEACH AND LAGUNA BEACH WHICH HAVE ALL BEEN IMPACTED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY BOILS BALL. IN SOME RESPECTS. THIS SPELL HAS BEEN OUR WORST FEARS COME TO LIFE IT'S HAD A DEVASTATING IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ON OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. AND I WANT MY CONSTITUENTS I WANT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS TO NOW THAT WE WILL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WE WILL ENSURE THAT ATTRACT TRAVESTY LIKE THIS DOES NOT OCCUR AGAIN ON OUR WATCH AND WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AMPLIFY ENERGY IS HELD FULLY ACCOUNTABLE I ON THE SUBJECT OF AMPLIFY ENERGY AS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY BEFORE WE BEGIN I DO YOU WANT TO EXPRESS MY EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT IN AMPLIFY ENERGY'S REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. I AS A POINT OF REFERENCE AFTER THE REFUGIO OIL SPILL WHICH OCCURRED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY IN THAT INCIDENT TESTIFIED IN A STATE LEGISLATIVE HEARING JUST SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE INCIDENT. AMPLIFY ENERGY EARLIER REFUSED TO TESTIFY AT THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE HEARING ON OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTH THAT POINT THE REQUESTED AN EXTENSION OF TWO WEEKS. TODAY'S HEARING AS WELL PAST THAT TWO WEEK WINDOW SO THEIR ABSENCE TODAY IS ALL THE MORE DISTURBING. AMPLIFY ENERGY'S REFUSAL TO ENGAGE WITH OUR COMMITTEE THEIR REFUSAL TO ENGAGE WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IS EMBARRASSING AND FRANKLY IT SENDS A VERY CLEAR MESSAGE TO OUR COMMUNITY EIGHT THAT YOU DO NOT CARE AND BE THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE. NEVER THE LESS. I THEIR ABSENCE NOTWITHSTANDING WE HAD A NUMBER OF KEY STAKEHOLDERS JOINING US TODAY FOR A VERY FULL AND ROBUST AGENDA TO ENGAGE THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE PUBLIC. BEFORE MOVING INTO OUR HEARING I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR ANY OPENING REMARKS I'D FIRST LIKE TO INVITE THE CHAIRS AT THE CONVENING COMMITTEES TO OFFER WELCOME REMARKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLIMP. THANK YOU AT AT YOUR PETRIE-NORRIS- AND- THANK YOU GOT YOUR RIVAS FOR YOUR THIS HEARING TODAY. BETWEEN OUR COMMITTEES AND I WANNA THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WERE- STEPPING FORWARD TO SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THAT THAT I SHARE- ALL OF THE COMMENTS- PROMOTE YOUR PETRIE-NORRIS REGARDING THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY NOT BEING HERE TODAY. IT IS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING- THEY SHOULD BE HERE- NEED TO- I'LL BE HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- TO TELL US WHAT THEY KNOW- AND- WE WILL SOLDIER ON WITHOUT THEM BEING HERE BUT- THEIR ABSENCE FROM THIS HEARING IS- NOT GOOD FOR THE PROCESS. AND TO LIKE KERN OF THE CHAIR SAID WE WILL MAKE SURE TO BE HOLDING THEM ACCOUNTABLE. CALIFORNIA'S COAST IS A PART OF THE SOUL OF OUR STATE AND HAS LAWMAKERS IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT IT. UNFORTUNATELY OIL SPILLS AND- THEREFORE THESE HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE REMOVE ALL CONTROL M. INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOURCES FROM OUR COAST WE CAN IMPROVE POLICIES IN RESPONSE BUT THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE A RISK. AS LONG AS WE PUMPED AND TRANSPORT PETROLEUM- THROUGH THE WATER. HI THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO BE DOING IT IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AS THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS RESOURCES ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION. I FOCUSED ON PROTECTING OUR COAST AND REDUCING PETROLEUM USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS AND SIMPLY PROVIDING FOR A SAFER ENVIRONMENT IN A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT. JUST THIS YEAR WE INCREASED FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE STAFF TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS. WE ALSO SPENT FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO PLUG AND ABANDON OFFSHORE WELL IN SANTA BARBARA GIVE YOU AN IDEA- I JUST HOW COSTLY- THIS KIND OF INSTRUCTION FOR STRUCTURE CAN BE THE TOTAL STATE COSTS IS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S NOT EVEN THE ENTIRE. COST OF THE PROJECT WITH AGING OIL INFRASTRUCTURE WE MUST ENSURE THAT RESPONSIBILITY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE TO PROTECT OUR COAST AND ARE INLAND AREAS FROM OIL DESTRUCTION. ADDITIONALLY THIS YEAR WE HAVE ALLOCATED THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TO ENCOURAGE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND I SECURED ONGOING FUNDING TO PROTECT MARINE LIFE AS WELL. WELL WE CAN CONTINUE TO SPEND DOLLARS TO TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WE ALSO NEED TO ADOPT STRONG POLICIES. TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC SPILLS IN THE FUTURE AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH EVERYONE WHO IS PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING IN IDENTIFYING AND ADOPTING THESE POLICIES. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR TAKING THE LEAD AND ORGANIZING THIS HEARING AND OF COURSE TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM- FOR JOINING US ARE YOU A SHOCKING AS THIS BILL IS IT SEEMS LIKE IT HAS BECOME A REGULAR OCCURRENCE THAT WE HAE ACCIDENTS IN THE PETROLEUM SUPPLY CHAIN. WE'VE HAD THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD MANY HEARINGS AND LEGISLATION REGARDING THESE ISSUES AND EACH TIME WE HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE HOWEVER OIL ALWAYS FINDS NEW WAYS TO GET INTO THE ENVIRONMENT TO THE POINT THAT'S BILL SEEM AN AB INEVITABLE. IN THIS CASE WE HAVE A MARINE SPILL ORIGINATING IN FEDERAL WATERS WERE A PIPELINE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT DISPLACEMENT WHICH WAS APPARENTLY UNDETECTED WHERE THIS BILL WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY DETECTED AND REPORTED AND WHERE THE RESPONSE WAS DELAYED. BY LAGS IN REPORTING AND DARKNESS. AS BAD AS THIS BILL HAS BEEN FOR THIS COMMUNITY WE GOT VERY LUCKY. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE THE COMMUNITY AND MANY OTHER COASTAL AND INLAND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. REMAIN AT RISK DUE TO THE INHERENT RISKS OF OIL PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY COMBINED WITH THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE OUTDATED POLLUTION CONTROLS AND AN ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE. AND THE FACT IS THAT THESE RISKS PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE DAILY HEALTH IMPACTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTION. REFINING AND USE EVEN IF ACCIDENTS ARE ELIMINATED USING OIL AS INTENDED UNFORTUNATELY KILLS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. AND LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES SUFFER THE MOST SO LET'S LEARN TODAY FROM THIS BILL AND ONCE AGAIN TRY TO SHARPEN OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO ACCIDENTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER INVEST UP WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LIKE TO MAKE A MARK FIVE MISTER MERCY TO BEGIN WITH YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS FOR CONVENING THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING I REPRESENT. OPEN TOGETHER WITH YOU I REPRESENTED A COASTAL DISTRICT OF FROM MANHATTAN BEACH DOWN THROUGH PALACE BIRDIES AND- YOU KNOW WE ARE CONSTANTLY REMINDED WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR OUR BEAUTIFUL COASTLINE THAT THIS IS- ONE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO PROTECT IT. I SUPPORT BANNING ALL OFFSHORE DRILLING I BELIEVE THAT- AS THE REST OF THE WORLD IS MOVING TOWARD PHASING OUT OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS AND TO RAMP UP. RENEWABLE ENERGY. THERE'S JUST NO GOOD REASON TO CONTINUE WITH OFF SHORE OIL DRILLING NOW I UNDERSTAND AS A- CHAIR BLOOM INDICATED THAT THE- SHUTTING DOWN EXISTING OIL OPERATIONS IS EXTREMELY COSTLY WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OPERATORS. UP PAY THE BILLS TO- PHASE OUT AND TO SHUT DOWN THESE PLATFORMS TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE ACCIDENTS BUT IN THE MEANTIME- MADAM CHAIR I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT. YOUR EXPERIENCE THE ORANGE COUNTY TO EXPERIENCE WHAT THE LATEST IS THE LATEST- ECOLOGICAL DISASTER THAT COMES FROM OFFSHORE DRILLING THANK YOU. HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS FOR CONVENIENCE HERE TODAY THANK OU CARE BERMAN CHAIR RIVAS- FOR MAKING THE JOINT HEARING WE KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM ALONE AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY- I THINK I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO'S PARTICIPATING TODAY THE PANELISTS THE PRESENTERS. WERE INTENDING IN PERSON AND REMOTELY BUT I RECOGNIZE THAT THE CHAIN OF EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE RUPTURE OF THE PIPELINES OF STUFF REMAIN UNDER ACTIVE INVESTIGATION I AM HOPEFUL WE CAN GET SOME INSIGHT TODAY INTO HOW AND WHY THIS OCCURRED. THE BILL HAS BEEN YET ANOTHER REMINDER THAT THERE'S NO 100% SAFE WAY TO EXTRACT OIL OFF OUR COASTLINE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT MEANS MOVING FORWARD OUR TASK IS TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS TO OUR COASTLINE AS WE CYCLE DOWN THE OPERATIONS PERMANENTLY. I REPRESENT NORTH COUNTY SAN DIEGO FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY BORDER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ENCINITAS AND CARDIFF AND THIS IS ALTHOUGH THE SELECT COMMITTEE IS CALLED THE ORANGE COUNTY OIL SPILL RESPONSE IT'S AFFECTED SAN DIEGO WE HAVE EVERY DAY I GET TEXTS FROM PEOPLE THE TAR BALLS WASHING UP ON A BEACH AND THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON OUR ECOSYSTEM. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RISK THAT IT POSES NOT JUST TO THE PLACE OF ORIGIN AND THAT IMMEDIATE AREA. BUT OUR ENTIRE COASTLINE. AS WELL MANAGED. AND HOW WE PREVENT SUCH EVENTS BUT ALSO AN IMPROVING HOW WE RESPOND. I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT HOW WE DID IN OUR RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS. WHERE THINGS WENT RIGHT AND WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE- THANK YOU AGAIN TO EVERYBODY PARTICIPATING TODAY AND THANK YOU AND I'M SURE FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH EVERYBODY HERE TODAY I CURRENTLY REPRESENT- BOTH OF BOTH THE CHICO STATE PARK ESTATE BEACH AND ALSO SUNSET BEACH SUNSET BEACH DID NOT HAVE THE OIL SPILL BUT WE HAVE HEARD OF SOME POTENTIAL AND ACTUALLY SOME TALL BARS HAVE GONE DOWN DIRECTION HOWEVER BOTH A CHICA STATE BEACH. HAS HAD THE OIL SPILL. OF WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT TO HUNTING BEACH. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THEM OUR COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR GATHERED US ALL HERE TODAY. TO DISCUSS ON. WHAT HAPPENED HOW DID IT HAPPEN. WHERE ARE WE AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE. AND I ALSO WANNA THANK A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE TRAVEL. TO ORANGE COUNTY FOR THIS MEETING. UPON LEARNING OF THIS BILL I WAS SURPRISED THE DELAY TO ALERT LOCAL OFFICIALS TO HELP HER. AND THE DELAY IN NOTIFYING THE PUBLIC OF THIS BILL EVENT. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE INFORMED AND PROVIDE THE MOST UP TO DATE INFORMATION TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO THE PUBLIC. ESPECIALLY IN EVENT LIKE THIS THAT POSES A POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS TO NOT ONLY RESIDENTS BUT TO ALSO WILDLIFE ALIKE. IN THE WILDLIFE WAS EXTREMELY BORED TO OUR DISTRICT BECAUSE WE HAVE. BOTH THE CHICA CONSERVANCY. I ALSO WANT TO ASK- MADAM CHAIR IF NOT TODAY BUT IN THE FUTURE WILL HOLD ANOTHER HEARING IS THAT WE HEARD NOW MANY SPECULATION DOESN'T KNOW THAT INVESTIGATIONS TO GROW CURRENTLY GOING ON. BUT THE CARGO SHIP. THE PORT OF LONG BEACH IN THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE AS WELL. BECAUSE REGARDLESS OF HOW WOULD WE KNOW THAT THIS OIL SPILL. BUT HOW WOULD COST HOW IT WAS BECAUSE A LOT OF COMMENTS HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY. AND REPORTED. THAT IT WAS A CARGO SHIP. THERE'S TOO MANY CARS THERE SHOULD BE NONE ALL THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED CARGO SHIP. ON THE COASTLINE OF ORANGE COUNTY BEACHES AND THAT STARTS WITH MY DISTRICT IS WHO WE WRE WHAT WERE RIGHT NEXT TO LONG BEACH PORT. IN ADDITION WE SHOULD ALSO HEAR FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVITED SO SHOULD BE THE LABOR. THE GROUP AS WELL BECAUSE WE NEED TO HEAR FROM THEM ON HOW WE CAN GO FORWARD EXPRESSION WHEN IT COMES TO THE CARGO SHIP AREA. AND INDUSTRY AND WE NEED TO MOVE THESE CARGO SHIP OUT. AGAIN I'M HOT B. L. I'M HOPING THIS COMMITTEE. AND CONTINUED TO WORK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A PARTICIPANT. AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WENT AND DIED. AT THANK YOU FOR IT FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS AND- I THINK THAT IF YOU IN AND OUT WITH THE FOLKS WHO ARE WATCHING. THIS IS THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS AND WE WILL CERTAINLY. HAVE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE WHICH WILL DIVE INTO A MANY OF THOSE THOSE TOPICS THAT TODD THAT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED. AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES.

I AM GRATEFUL TO THE SPEAKER AND OFFICIALS WE WILL HEAR FROM TODAY ABOUT THIS BILL AND WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT OTHER DISASTERS. I KNOW MUCH OF TODAY'S TOPIC WILL BE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS HOWEVER I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE WILL ALSO TOUCH UPON THIS WHICH IS ECONOMIC DISASTER FOR COUNTIES WELL. LOST IN THE MEDIA COVERAGE WAS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TOURISM CAPITAL MANY VERY SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE HOTELS RESTAURANTS AND FISHING COMPANIES WERE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ANY NEW POLICY OR LAWS ARE PRODUCED RELATED TO THIS INCIDENT INCLUDING ECONOMIC LENS AS WELL. AS A ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DECISIONS REGARDING LEGISLATION MOVE FORWARD AS COMMONSENSE DECISIONS AND THAT THIS WON'T END UP BEING A BAD IMPACT ARE HAVING BAD REPUTATIONS NOT ONLY FOR THOSE THAT LIVE ON THE COAST LINE BUT FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WELL.

THANK YOU CAN HEAR ME. OKAY ARE YOU GUYS THANK YOU FOR- FOR HAVING HERE TODAY- KEPT IN YOUR LONG GEORGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I AM THE HARBORMASTER FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE WHICH MEANS I'M IN CHARGE OF ALL THREE HARBORS PROVIDING LAW ENFORCEMENT- KNOWING FOR THE HARBORS WITH THE COASTLINE BUT- IN ORANGE COUNTY. TO HARBOR PATROL ALSO DOES MARINE FIREFIGHTING SEARCH AND RESCUE WORK ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND WILDLIFE PROTECTION- WE HAD ALL THOSE THINGS SO IT'S JUST A MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR US TO DO EVERYTHING TO HAVE. ALL THOSE DIFFERENT ENTITIES ON THE WATER- I'M HERE TODAY TO HELP THE TRANSCRIPT ANY. INFORMATION I CAN WITH THE- DATE OF THAT INCIDENT AND I THINK ABOUT IT IS YOU KNOW GO OVER REAL QUICKLY. OUR. ROLE FROM A RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING. APRAKSIN FIVE THIRTY PM ON FRIDAY OCTOBER FIRST. THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HARBOR PATROL BOATS WERE ENGAGED WITH THE HONEY TO BEACH- SHOW. THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH- DEPUTIES ON SCENE. OVERHEARD LOW POWERED RADIO TRANSMISSIONS OVER THE MARINE RADIO OF AN UNUSUAL ORDER AND POSSIBLE FUEL SPILL IN THE WATER. IN THAT AREA. SO DEPUTY SELF DEPLOYED TO THE AREA BUT BEING AS AT THE AIR SHOW WAS COMING TO AN END MANY BOATS WERE LEAVING. AND SO IT TURNS UP THE WATER AND SO THEY THOUGHT MAYBE A BOAT IS. WHAT WE CALL BURPED OUT AS A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUEL FROM ITS BILL WHICH- AND- AND EXPLAIN THAT LATER IF YOU LIKE- IN IT WOULD JUST TURNED UP BY THE PERFECT PROPS OF EACH OF THE VOTERS ARE TAKEN OFF. SO AFTER DOING A SELF. DEPLOYED PATROL JACK THEY'RE UNABLE TO LOCATE HIS BILL SO THIS WENT BACK TO THEIRREGULAR POSITION- PROVIDING SECURITY FOR THE AIR SHOW. UNTIL IT ENDED IN OF. AND THEN RETURNED BACK TO THE STATION. AT ABOUT SIX FIFTEEN PM- HARBOR PATROL DISPATCH. COULD OVERHEAR A CARGO SHIP REPORTING A POSSIBLE FUEL SPILL. A RECORD REPORTING A SHEEN IN THE WATER- TO THE U. S. COAST GUARD. AND THEN ABOUT EIGHT PM THAT NIGHT THE US COAST GUARD CONTACTED US VIA TELEPHONE- NEWPORT BEACH RICKARD DISPATCH CENTER REQUESTED ASSISTANCE. WITH LOCATING A POSSIBLE OIL SPILL. AND- IN BEING IT WAS ALREADY DARK OUTSIDE IT'S EXTREMELY HARD TO SEE YOU CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS GUY IN THE OCEAN BECAUSE EVERYTHING JUST LOOKS BLACK AND SO TRYING TO LOCATE IN A BLACK SUBSTANCE ON THE WATER WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE- IN IT- SO. WE AGREED WITH THE COAST GUARD THE NEXT MORNING THE SET UP AROUND SEVEN THIRTY SO SOMETIME BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND SEVEN FORTY FIVE. US COAST GUARD HAS MATT INVESTIGATOR ORDERED OUR ONE OF OUR BOATS OUT OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SET OUT AND IT STILL DURING THE DAYLIGHT STILL TOOK US AN HOUR TO LOCATE. THE A PLUME OF OIL ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS IN DIAMETER. AND WHEN IT WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE COLLECTING SAMPLES ARE SHOULD SAY THE COAST GUARD WAS COLLECTING SAMPLES. OF THAT IS WHEN WE HEARD MORE RADIO TRAFFIC- FROM A MARINE RADIO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO. AND IN REPORTING A LARGER OIL SPILL ABOUT FIVE MILES OFF. THE TWENTY TWO BEACH SO WE WENT OUT THERE AND LOCATED THAT LARGE OIL SCHOOL AT THAT TIME. AND SO WE ASKED A- HELICOPTER ONE OF OUR SHIPS HELICOPTERS TO FLY OVER TO CAPTURE VIDEO OF IT. AND TO TRYING TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE AND- IN FROM COMING DOWN COAST UP WE COULD SEE IS LIKE A FUNNEL EFFECT. AND SO WE KIND OF PINPOINTED FROM THE START WHERE WE BELIEVED THAT IT MIGHT BE FROM. AND MY SURGEON ON DUTY- WENT WELL ABOVE AND BEYOND AND- NOTIFIED THAT- LOOKED ON A CHART AND SAW WERE- THE GPS LOCATION OF WHERE WE BELIEVE THE SOURCE WAS COMING FROM AND NOTIFY THE OIL PLATFORMS. BUT NINE THIRTY AM. ON SATURDAY THE TWO THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE- AND WHAT'S- THE- I. LEAGUE IN THEIR SYSTEM. AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE TO DO THE PROTOCOLS AND THAT'S THE- IN BY TEN THIRTY- THE COAST GUARD CALLED US AND SAID THAT- THE VERIFIED THAT THE WORLD'S. OIL SPILL IS COMING FROM THEM AND THAT THEY ARE TAKING OVER THE INVESTIGATION. IN IN THE IN THAT HOURS TIME WE HI I HAVE MY DISPATCH TEAM NOTIFY. ALL THE CITIES ON THE COASTLINE. OF ORANGE COUNTY OF A POSSIBLE OIL SPILL THAT MAY BE AFFECTING THE- ORANGE COUNTY. AND ALSO IN TO INCLUDE OCEANSIDE AND SAN DIEGO IN THOSE CALLS BECAUSE KNOWING THE WITH THE TIDE. IT'S I KNOW IT'S GOING TO GO TO- THINGS HALFWAY BETWEEN CATALINA IN ORANGE COUNTY IN UP IN SAN DIEGO- BOATS AND OTHER THINGS I THINK- I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD NOT ALL. OF. THE POSSIBLE BUT WILL STILL HAVE THEIR WAY. IN THE TWO AFTER. THAT THE WE DO. WE JOIN THE MATTER TEAM AND HELPED OUT HOWEVER WE CAN. PROTECTING THE HARBORS IN. IN THE CLOSING DOWN. BELIEVE US SUNDAY I DON'T I DON'T REMEMBER THE TOP OF MY HEAD- HAVE JUST PROTECT OIL FROM COMING IN- TO OUR HARBORS. MISFIT THANK YOU AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL BURKE WE'LL HEAR FROM ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND THEN JUMP INTO QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. ARE JERRY BROWN AT TWENTY KNOTS FROM ORANGE COUNTY COAST KEEPER. THANK YOU. AND CHAIR MY NAME IS GERRY BROWN EYED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN ADDRESS YEAR TO DATE I AM THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY COURSE KEEPER AND ON DECEMBER FIRST I'D I'D GET SWORN IN FOR MY SEVENTH THREE YEAR TERM ON THE PORT OF LA LONG BEACH- OSCAR. COMMITTEE IN THE HARBOR SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR THE PORT. OKAY FIRST OF ALL. I WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL IN THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY REPRESENT- ANY OIL SPILL IS A CATASTROPHE EMITTERS TREMENDOUS IMPACTS FROM- BUT HAS BEEN HAVE HAS BEEN SAID PREVIOUSLY THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. AND SO WE DON'T MINIMIZE IT BUT- WE'RE LUCKY IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE- I HAVE NOTHING BUT COMPLIMENTS FOR THE QUICK ACTIONS THAT WE'RE TAKING THE EXPEDIENT CLOSING OF THE BEACHES AND HARBORS. UNTIL MORE INFORMATION WAS KNOWN- INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED THE PUBLIC THERE WAS GREAT TRANSPARENCY M. THERE HAS BEEN SINCE THAT DAY IN CONTINUES TODAY DALY REPORTED HIMSELF. WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE ACTIONS OF OUR FOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE OF THE COUNTY OF THE CITY- EVERYBODY DID THEIR JOB AND THEY DID IT WELL SO THANK YOU. THERE ARE TWO STANDARDS THAT I THINK YOU HAVE THE TOOLS TO USE IN THE- THEIR STANDARDS CONTAINED IN THE CALIFORNIA'S NINETEEN NINETY US FOR- STATUTES THE OIL. SPILL RESPONSE AND RESTORATION ACT ONE STANDARD IS BEST ACHIEVABLE PROTECTIONS WE USE THAT TODAY IN WATER QUALITY WE JUST CALL IT BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY BUT- IT DOES EXIST AND IT SAYS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WILL HOLD OIL COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT AS TECHNOLOGY AS A MESSAGE AS SENSORS AS REQUIREMENT- INVOLVES THAT THE OIL COMPANIES WILL IMPLEMENT THAT. M. AFTER THIRTY ONE YEARS I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SHE AN EVALUATION- OF ACTUALLY WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE BLOOMS AND DISPERSANTS THAT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY. AND SELF YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S A. A STARTING PLACE- THE THING IS FOR MEDICATION WE FIND IN MOST REGULAR RATE REGULATIONS THAT ARE THERE'S ALWAYS AN ECONOMIC BALANCING WHAT WHAT CAN YOU DO GOOD WHAT CAN YOU DO TO MITIGATE AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE COST EFFECTIVE. SPECIFICALLY FOR MEDICATION IN THE OSCAR ACT. DID IT UP DOES NOT- IN AND IT SPECIFICALLY STATES ECONOMICS WILL NOT BE A FACTOR. THAT MITIGATION MUST BE DONE REGARDLESS OF THE COST AND IF THE OPERATOR DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY THEN. THE OIL INDUSTRY SHOULD CHIP IN AND SO THOSE ARE TWO VERY OF THE INCREDIBLE OF STANDARDS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY BY. THE MEMBERS OF THE TABLE IN NINETEEN NINETY M. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE ROBUST NOW AS THEY WERE. INTENDED TO BE IN NINETEEN NINETY. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S BEEN SIX MAJOR OIL SPILLS SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. M. I GUARANTEE TO FIX I GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE MORE OIL SPILLS. I ALSO GUARANTEE THAT. THE PLATFORM OPERATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OIL SPILL YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF. THE POINT BEING THAT LARGE COMPANIES ARE GONE. SHELL EXXON UNION ARE CO AND CHEVRON WHO BUILT THESE ARE GONE THERE'S MAYBE SOME UNDERLYING LEASES BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE NOT OPERATING IN YOU HAVE MORE FAR MORE MARGINAL COMPANIES OPERATING IN YET YOU KNOW THE- THE IMPACTS OF AN OIL SPILL ARE SO GREAT. I JUST WONDER IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING BETTER. IF THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN PLATFORMS ARE GOING TO START DECOMMISSIONING A CLEAR PATH TO EXPEDITE DECOMMISSIONING MUST BE DEVELOPED. CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS THREE PLATFORMS OPERATING PLATFORMS PLUS HOLLY WHICH WAS ABANDONED BY RANOCO. TWENTY THREE YEAR IN FEDERAL WATERS WE HAVE TWO OPTIONS. IN COMPLETE REMOVAL RETURNING THE BOTTOM TO ITS NATURAL STATE AND WE HAVE RIGS TO REEFS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT RICK ST- I WAS INVOLVED WITH THE WITH THE ORGANIZATION THAT CALIFORNIA ARTIFICIAL REEF ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM AND WE SPENT TEN YEARS GETTING THE LEGISLATION- AT THE TIME TO BE SPEAKER HERTZBERG. OF IS SPONSORED THE LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ARNOLD- GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS WERE NEVER PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S TIME FRAMES IN THE LEGISLATION THAT MAKE IT INFEASIBLE THE COMMISSION WITHOUT WOULD GO BACK INTO FIX THAT LEGISLATION BUT THAT WAS NEVER DONE AND I THINK OF SERIOUS WORK WOULD BE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATUTE AB TWENTY FIVE OH THREE- JUST VERY EXTREMELY BRIEFLY. IT REQUIRES A AB ROBUST BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF EACH ROOF TO DETERMINE IF THEY IN FACT ARE PRODUCING PRODUCTIVE HABITATS IN WEEKS- IF SHOW THEIR THE PROPOSAL IS TO CUT HIM OFF AT EIGHTY FEET BELOW THE SURFACE CALCULATE THE COST SAVINGS THE OIL COMPANY SAVES BY NOT REMOVING THEM. AND THEY BASICALLY WRITE A CHECK TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 465285% OF THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL. GO TO COASTAL RESTORATION. THE STRUCTURE BELONGS TO PROPERTY OF THE STATE IN THE OIL COMPANIES PERPETUALLY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WELL HAD SAFETY. SO THE POINT IS THIS THE EXIST THE THIS TOOL IN THIS CONVERSATION AND I'M SO DELIGHTED WERE HAVING IT TODAY AND AGAIN I THANK ALL OF YOU- THIS CONVERSATION WENT DORMANT ON THE SHELF SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY DISCUSSION. AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING POSITIVE OUT OF THIS OIL SPILL IT'S POSSIBLY TO REIGNITE THIS CONVERSATION AND TO REPLY BUT WE ALL KNOW WE ALL SIT HERE AND WE ALL REALIZE THESE OIL PLATFORMS NEED TO. BE DECOMMISSIONED AND COME OUT M. I WOULD JUST TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND IN DOING THAT THE BILL THAT WE HAD. IT WASN'T A FIGHT. IT WASN'T TO BATTLE THE OIL COMPANIES WANT A CLEAR PATH TO COMPLIANCE THEY'RE OPERATING AT A MANY CASES AT A LOSS BUT IT'S CHEAPER TO OPERATE AT A LOSS THAN IT IS TO FACE. MILLIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING. THEY'RE LOOKING AND WAITING FOR A CLEAR PATH THAN WE HAVE NOW AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I WOULD GIVE YOU THE LEGISLATORS- AND YOU CAN DO IT AND SO. I THINK THIS IS A SOLVABLE THING I THINK THEY'RE STAKEHOLDERS WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ANYWHERE YOU CAN IN YOUR LEADERSHIP THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME. AND I THINK WHAT WE'LL TRY TO DO IS GO TO OUR- REMOTE TESTIMONY AND GET DIRECTOR BONHAM. ON THE LINE. TAKE TO. YES BACK THE LETTER IN ORDER. YES. HE'S HERE AND THERE AND- LET ME KNOW IF IT'S APPROPRIATE TO TURN IT OFF. WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOU AND WE DON'T SEE THE VIDEO SAID BUT I THINK AUDIO IS JUST FINE. SO WE CAN CARRY. IT IS TRUE MY NAME IS JOE FONG AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. AND I LIKE TO DO A COUPLE OF QUICK INNINGS AND THEN TURNS TO MY COLLEAGUE THE ADMINISTRATOR FOR ARE ALL THIS IS BILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE MISTER ALAN. SO HERE'S THE FIRST THING I LIKE TO. CLARIFY WITH BUSINESS. FINALLY WELLS BILLS YOU'LL IDOLS BILLS BOTH BILLS ARE BAD. HURT US IN SO MANY WAYS THAT WE CARE ABOUT. FULL STOP. HEY ON THIS ASPECT. OUR JOB WHO IS BILL'S STARTS IS TO RESPOND. AND MANAGE IT IN THE MOMENT. I LIKE TO DO IS JUST THANK EACH OF YOU STARTING WITH THIS YEAR. BUT LITERALLY ALMOST EVERY PERSON ON THE PANEL TODAY I'VE SPOKEN WITH SIGNIFICANTLY OFFLINE ONE ON ONE OF THE COURSE OF THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF. UNFORTUNATELY I MET A FEW OF YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. SOME OF YOU ARE KNOWN FOR QUITE SOMETIME. AND I THINK YOU SENDS TO.

BUT WE HAVE COLLABORATED IN THIS BILL ACROSS SO MANY LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. CITIES COUNTIES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH STATE AND FEDERAL THAT COLLECTIVE EFFORT IS ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PARTS OF THIS NO RESPONSE IN MY OPINION. THE NEXT THING I WANT IS JUST SKIP. ALL THE REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED- AND HOW IT HAPPENED. WE KNOW THESE FACTS NOW. BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER A PIPELINE OF. DIRECTOR THE AUDIOS THE IDEA% KEEPS DETERIORATING SO CAN WE GET A PLAN C. I AM LOOKING AT OUR OUR TECH ADMIN FOLKS OVER THERE CAN WE PLEASE GET JUST CALL IN NUMBER FOR.

MAYOR KIM CARR IS JOINING US FROM THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AMERICORPS WASN'T ON THE FRONT LINE OF MUCH OF THIS RESPONSE WERE GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A LITTLE BIT LATE WE HAD OUR STATE OF THE CITY- THE ADDRESS THIS MORNING FROM EIGHT AM TO TEN SO I CAME STRAIGHT HERE- SO ASSEMBLY WOMAN I JUST WANT TO. HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE IF YOU WERE AT IF YOU WANT TO DO SORT OF A THREE TO FIVE MINUTES OKAY VIEW AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM ALL THE PANELISTS AND JUMP INTO SOME MORE Q. AND A PERFECT SO I'LL JUST GO IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU FROM THE BEGINNING OF WHEN WE WERE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE OIL SPILLS SO ON SATURDAY OCTOBER SECOND WE- WE RECEIVED A MESSAGE. THAT THE COAST GUARD HAD PUT OUT A MESSAGE SAYING THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OIL SPILL OFF THE SHORE OF COAST OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SO WE REALLY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT DRAMATIC AT THAT TIME IT WAS SOMETHING TO JUST PUT ON THE RADAR AND SO WE WERE MONITORING IT BUT ALSO THAT DAY AS MOST OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW WE WERE IN THE MIDST OF OUR PACIFIC AIR SHOW AND THAT DAY WE HAD ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BEACH AND HUNTINGTON BEACH TO ENJOY. THE PACIFIC CARE SHOW SO WE WERE MONITORING THIS OIL SPILL BUT REALLY THE FOCUS WAS ON THE AIR SHOW HROUGHOUT THE DAY WE STARTED TO GET MORE MESSAGING ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL OIL SPILL AND WE STARTED GETTING SYSTEM REALLY CONFLICTING MESSAGING ABOUT IT SO AS THE DAY PROGRESSED THE COAST GUARD HAD TOLD US- THAT THIS OIL SPILL WAS SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT BE REACHING OUR SHORE UNTIL MONDAY OCTOBER FOURTH. SO AGAIN WE WERE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS AND AS WE STARTED TO GET SOME FEEDBACK FROM VOTERS WHO WERE OUT IN THE OCEAN- WATCHING THE AIR SHOW WE STARTED TO REALIZE THAT THIS WAS AS IN GOING TO BE HEADING OUR SHORES. ON MONDAY OCTOBER FOURTH. MORE LIKELY IT WAS GOING TO BE HITTING OUR SHORES THAT EVENING. SO OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT MARINE SERVICES- ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. GOT TOGETHER- AND REALLY STARTED TO AN ACTOR OR OIL SPILL RESPONSE PROGRAM- AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY A- FULL. A GIANT BINDER ON WHAT TO DO WHEN THERE'S AN OIL SPILL. AND WE DECIDED THAT MOMENT AT AROUND TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THAT IF THE OIL DID START TO APPROACH THE SHORES. WE WOULD ENACT THAT PROCEDURE- ROUND FOUR THIRTY THAT AFTERNOON. WE WERE TOLD AGAIN THE OIL WOULD NOT BE HITTING OUR SHORES AND TILL. MONDAY OCTOBER FOURTH BUT THEY WERE VOTERS OUT THERE SEEN ACTUALLY THE OIL IS JUST A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF YOUR COAST RIGHT NOW. SO AT THAT MOMENT WE DECIDED TO BE PROACTIVE AND START TO LAY A LOT OF PROTECTIVE BOOM AROUND OUR MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS. LIKE THE TALBERT MARSH LIKE THE BOLSA CHICA ECOLOGICAL RESERVE SEVEN SENSITIVE SITES THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH. AND WE BY BY DOING THIS WE REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH WE AVERTED- A POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL DISASTER- BY NINE O'CLOCK THAT EVENING. THERE WAS OIL ON THE SHORES OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AGAIN THIS WAS SATURDAY- AND THAT EVENING WE DECIDED TO HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE AND LET OUR RESIDENTS KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAD- SO. AGAIN IT WAS VERY CHAOTIC I WOULD SAY FOR THOSE FIRST THIRTY SIX HOURS. BUT THAT SAID. THE NEXT DAY THE U. S. COAST GUARD AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH. THEY CAME TOGETHER AND AS- DIRECTOR BONHAM SAID IT TRULY WAS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK MOMENT- I AM GRATEFUL WITH THE RESPONSE THAT THE COAST GUARD IMPLEMENTED. WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE LITERALLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. ON OUR SHORES CLEANING UP. TAR BALLS WE HAD PEOPLE OUT AT THE TOP BURKE MARCH SKIMMING OIL AND CLEANING THAT AREA UP. AND BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE TAKEN AND BEING REALLY PROACTIVE WE WERE ABLE TO AVERT A LOT OF THE DAMAGE THAT HAPPENED THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN. TO OUR WETLANDS- IT SO. THROUGH ALL OF THIS PROCESS WE WERE ABLE TO RE OPEN OUR BEACHES WITHIN EIGHT DAYS AFTER THE SPELL AND THIS WAS AFTER EXTENSIVE WATER TESTING IN IT AFTER YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING WAS CLEAN AND- THAT IT WAS SAFE FOR OUR VISITORS OUR SERVERS OUR COMMUNITY- BUT TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE IMPACT OF THIS. AS I MENTIONED ON SATURDAY WE HAD THE AIR SHOW WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE OBVIOUSLY ON SUNDAY WE HAD TO COUNSEL THAT. THAT WAS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT TO OUR COMMUNITY THERE WERE RESTAURANTS HOTELS- A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAD GEARED UP FOR A MILLION PEOPLE TO COME TO THE COMMUNITY SO. A LOT OF THAT WAS. THERE WAS NO WAY THAT YOU COULD RECOVER IF YOU ADD BAR PURCHASED YOU KNOW A TON OF FOOD AND A TON OF- PROVISIONS FOR A MASSIVE CROWD TO COME THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM THE HOTELS THAT RECEIVED CANCELLATIONS- FROM THE RESTAURANTS THAT YOU KNOW HAD- THAT THEY HAD TO EITHER SPOILER GIVEAWAY- BUT AS A CITY. SO FAR TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE CLEAN UP THE FIRST WEEK ALONE WE SPENT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE WERE AVERAGING AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY. AND EXPENSES TOWARD THE CLEAN UP- AND IN ADDITION WE DID NOTICE A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF IN RESERVATIONS AT THE HOTEL. WE HAD TO CANCEL SEVERAL EVENTS WE HAD SURF CONTESTS PLANNED WE HAD- FOOD FESTIVALS PLANNED WE HAD A LOT OF EVENTS THAT WE WERE WE HAD TO CANCEL. BECAUSE OF THE OIL SPILL- AND THEN. ALSO I JUST WANT TO SAY THERE WAS A BIT OF A- REPUTATION DAMAGETHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW THIS WAS A INTERNATIONAL EVENT AND SO PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT WHERE TO PUT THEIR- VACATION DOLLARS WHERE TO WHERE THEY WANT TO GO FOR THEIR CONVENTION. THEY TOOK A PAUSE WHEN THINKING ABOUT GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY OVERALL BECAUSE OF THE OIL SPILL- I'M GRATEFUL THOUGH TO SAY THAT WE- ARE BLESSED WITH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER. BEAUTIFUL BEACHES NEVER THE LESS AND SO WE WILL RECOVER AND WE WILL BE MORE RESILIENT AND STRONGER THAN EVER. BUT AS YOU KNOW OUR DIRECTOR BOTTOM SAID THERE IS NO SUCH GOOD THING AS AN OIL SPILL WE CONTINUE TO LEARN WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER- AND I WOULD US IF THE STATE LEGISLATORS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT- OPPORTUNITIES TO GET BETTER. WE REALLY FEEL THAT THE RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT DAYS IT REALLY IS MINUTES IT'S HOURS THAT MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO THINK THAT IF WE WOULD HAVE HAD MAYBE A COUPLE OF MORE HOURS. WE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED SOME OF THE DAMAGE THAT HAPPENED AT TALBERT MARCH THAT WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE CLEAN UP. I'M IF WE COULD HAVE HAD A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME MAYBE WE COULD HAVE PREVENTED SOME OF THAT OIL FROM. SEEPING INTO THAT ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREA BUT NEVER THE LESS I AS I SAID I DON'T WANT TO- SAY ANYTHING REALLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE COAST GUARD BECAUSE THEY WERE FABULOUS- IT WAS JUST THAT INITIAL. PERIOD WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION A LOT OF CAN SIXTEEN AND FOR- IF THERE WAS ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME TIME TO. KIND OF LOOK BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHT COULD WE HAVE DONE BETTER. AND TALKING TO MY- FIRE CHIEF IN MY POLICE CHIEF. WHAT WE CONSISTENTLY HERE IS IF THE COAST GUARD COULD HAVE NOTIFIED US IMMEDIATELY. RATHER THAN THE PROCESS THAT THEY GO THROUGH RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GOING THROUGH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES BEFORE. IT ACTUALLY HITS THE AGENCY MOST AFFECTED BY WHICH IS THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH MAYBE IF THAT COULD BE MORE STREAMLINED AND SO THERE WEREN'T SO MANY SILOS. OF THIS DEPARTMENT DOES THIS THIS DEPARTMENT DOES THAT AND THEN ALSO- WE WERE BLESSED AND THAT WE DID HAVE AN OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN IN PLACE. AND IF I HAD JUST ONE MINUTE A QUICK STORY ABOUT THAT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS OIL SPILL HAD WE NOT HAD A BOAT THAT SANK. THE YEAR BEFORE AND HUNTINGTON HARBOUR AND THAT CREATED A LITTLE BABY MANY OIL SPILL IN HUNTINGTON HARBOUR IN TWENTY TWENTY. SO OUR FIRE CHIEF WAS LOOKING AT A OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN AND SAID. HEY YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE MISSING SOME EQUIPMENT HERE WE NEED THIS WE NEED THAT. AND HE TOOK THE NEXT YEAR APPLIED FOR GRANTS WAS ABLE TO GET THINGS LIKE AN OIL SPILL TRAILER SOME MORE PROTECTIVE BOOM. AND WE LITERALLY JUST GOT ALL OF THOSE ITEMS A FEW MONTHS AGO. AND I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE IF WE DDN'T HAVE THAT STUFF WITH THIS OIL SPILL IN PLACE SO. IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE ALL OVER COASTAL CITIES TO IMPLEMENTED OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLAN AND HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW SOME FUNDING FROM THE STATE. SO THAT THEY CAN GET THOSE GROUNDS- TO GET THAT EQUIPMENT AND THEN ALSO IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE OF A REGIONAL RESPONSE BECAUSE- WE KNOW IN HUNTINGTON BEACH WE HAVE A VERY LARGE MARINE SAFETY. A GROUP A LARGE FIRE DEPARTMENT BUT WE CAN ALWAYS HELP OUT OUR NEIGHBORS I SEAL BEACH. NEWPORT BEACH- AND HAVE MORE OF A REGIONAL- A PRO COACH IF NEED. BUT AGAIN I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF- ALL OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND TO YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN CUDDY PETRI NORRIS FOR BEING THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY- AND THEN TO ALL OF OUR NON PROFITS LIKE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION THE BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS THE BOLSA CHICA CONSERVANCY. AND ALL OF THE VOLUNTEERS WHO VOLUNTEERED NOT JUST MONEY BUT THEIR TIME TO HELP WITH THE CLEANUP SO. AS A DIRECTOR BONTA SAID HE TRULY WAS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR EVERYBODY'S HELP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MAYOR CAR. UP WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND TAKE A TWO MINUTE RECESS THE WEEKEND I. JUST FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET AUDIO CONNECTED WITH DIRECTOR BONHAM. AT THIRTY MINUTES WE WILL BE BACK. ALL RIGHT WE ARE BACK IN ACTION AND- WE ARE GOING TO. DISPENSE WITH THEIR FANCY TECHNOLOGY AND ADD TO THE SOMEWHAT OLD SCHOOL TO- DR BONHAM IS GOING TO BE JOINING US. FOR MYSELF. ALL RIGHT AT DIRECTOR BONHAM WE'VE GOT YOU ON MY CELLPHONE AND- HOPEFULLY AT. HOPEFULLY THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR YOU AS YOU COME THROUGH MY MICROPHONE. YEAH LOOK SO I BETTER HAVE GOOD TESTIMONY AFTER ALL THIS. SURE CAN YOU HEAR ME OK YES. OKAY HEY LET ME JUST HERE'S WHAT I SAID IN THE EARLIER EFFORTS- FIRST NO BILL IS A GOOD SPELL THEY'RE ALL BAD HEY HEARD ISN'T SO MANY WAYS WE CARE ABOUT I ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THEIR CARS EXPRESSION OF- THE PAIN IN THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS BILL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND CHAIR I KNOW YOU FEEL THE SAME. WE SPOKE OFTEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST MONTH. THE SECOND THING I SAID WAS- I- HUGE THANK YOU TO EVERYONE EVERYONE THERE EVERYONE NOT THERE THAT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BUT REALLY LET ME TURN TO THE HEART OF IT. WE CAN GET BETTER WE HAVE TO GET BETTER THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF COMING TO AN OVERSIGHT HEARING. THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE TO ADAPT. RESILIENCY IS THE MEASURE OF LEARNING FROM YOUR LESSONS. THIS HAPPENED AFTER COSCO BUSAN IT HAPPENED AFTER THE SANTA BARBARA SPILL REFUGIO CALIFORNIA STRONG WE CAN GET BETTER. SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I AM PERSONALLY THINKING ABOUT AS AREAS OF. SO THE FIRST EXAMPLE I THINK WE NEED TO EXPLORE CAPACITY AT A LOCAL LEVEL SO MAYOR CARNAGE AND- BLOOD FOR THEM HAVING SUBMITTED A GRANT AND RECEIVED A QUICK MANNER THE RESPONSE AT TALBERT MARSH MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE INJURED. THAT ACTUALLY IS A GRANT PROGRAM I THINK OUR DEPARTMENT RUNS TO US BURKE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT LOCAL RESPONSE EQUIPMENT ABILITY BLOOM MOBILE UNITS UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND THE HUNTINGTON BEACH EXAMPLE OF HOW THEY- FEEL GO FOR WAITED. ON SATURDAY BY DEPLOYING AT TALBERT MARSH IS A CASE STUDY WHY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT CAPACITY OUR CURRENT PROGRAM I THINK WAS IT IS WITH ABOUT SIX PORTS. BUT MAYBE WE NEED TO CONSIDER AT A COUNTY LEVEL. A SECOND AREA OF IMPROVEMENT AND MY MIND IS WE NEED TO GO LOOK AT WHAT A CALL BACK CONTINGENCY PLANS- THE DOCUMENTS THAT THREE IDENTIFY ALL THE SENSITIVE AREAS AND THE STRATEGY. YES THIS BILL WHAT HAPPENS. WHY OF THE THINGS THAT'S US DOWN IN THE EARLY IS WE SPENT A LOT OF THE SITE. TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT PLACE FOR THE INCIDENT COMMAND POST. WE NEED GET BEYOND. AND BASICALLY HAVE DONE OUR REAL ESTATE DUE TO DILIGENCE BEFORE A SPILL SO WE KNOW APPROPRIATE PUBLIC VENUES WE CAN HOST THE COMMAND. THAT ARE NOT FACILITIES OWNED BY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY I THINK A RESPONSIBLE PARTY VENUE CREATES CONFUSION IN THE PUBLIC. AND UNDERCUTS TRUST. OTHER EXAMPLES OF IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE THE WORLD'S BEST OILED WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO SPILLS. THAT IS A REASON WHY WE GOT A SUCCESS IN THIS BILL WE ACTIVATED THAT NETWORK PROMPTLY IT ACTUALLY HAD DISABILITIES AND EXPERTS IN THE AREA. NEARBY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REPLICATE SOME SIMILAR NETWORK. FOR OUR CONSERVATION ENVIRONMENTAL NON PROFITS UP AND DOWN THE COAST SOME WAY TO PRE TRAIN REGULARLY COMMUNICATE WITH AND STAYING CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR AFFILIATE VOLUNTEERS SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT IN THE CHAOTIC BEGINNING MOMENTS. BUT THAT RESOURCES MORE READILY AVAILABLE MORE READILY DEPLOYABLE. WE TO IMPROVE IN TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. YOU HEARD FROM MISTER BROWN THAT. WE USE OLD TECHNOLOGY I WOULD SUBMIT IN RESPONSE BLAME WHETHER OLDER NEWS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IT'S WHAT HELPS DEAL WITH ALBERT MARSH. WE DID NOT USE THIS PERSON COMES HELLO WE DON'T USE THEM IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT OF REGULATION AROUND IT. BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE YET IS CRACKED THE TECHNOLOGY NOT ON MY TALK. AS THE SHERIFF MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT A DARK SHEEN IN THE DARK OF NIGHT ON A DARK OCEAN SURFACE BUT I GOTTA THINK. WITH CALIFORNIA BEING A TECHNOLOGY LEADER THERE MIGHT BE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT SPACE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES US PER TO DO IT TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP EVERY TWO YEARS. IF WE FOLLOWED CURRENT TIMELINE WE WOULD DO A WORKSHOP I THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE NEED TO DO WANTED TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND USE THIS BILL AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR THE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON KIND OF NIGHT TIME. TECHNOLOGY IN MY OPINION. WE'RE IMPROVING IN THE MIDDLE THIS BILL SIR. WAS ARE. IDENTIFIED NONPROFIT LIAISE ALL THROUGH THIS BILL THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER DONE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. ON THEIR OWN THEY CAME UP WITH A TARBALL APPLICATION PEOPLE COULD USE ON THEIR PHONES AND WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY USEFUL ON OUR- LAST AREA OF IMPROVEMENT I THINK THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT. FISHERIES CLOSURES AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND- FORTY FIVE SQUARE MILES STILL CLOSE FOR COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING. I DON'T THINK WE CAN SOLVE THE FISHERIES CALLING HER DYNAMIC AND SPILLS BY BUILDING ANOTHER LABORATORY SOMEWHERE. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT TAKES ABOUT FOURTEEN DAYS TO THE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES FROM FISH WELL TO THE HYDROCARBONS YOU'RE TESTING FOR. BUT THIS BILL WE USE COMMERCIAL FISHING TO HELP US COLLECTED SAMPLES MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO USE COMMERCIAL FISHING MORE COLLECTS SAMPLES FASTER MOVE THE SAMPLES INTO PROCESSING SOONER EVEN THOUGH WE MAY REMAIN WITH A LABORATORY BOTTLE. THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I'LL JUST CONFIRM FOR YOU WE KNOW HOW TO GET BETTER WORKING WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS ON THE PANEL RIGHT THERE WE LEARNED FROM THE REFUGIO SPILL HERE'S WHAT WE DID IN THE ORANGE COUNTY SAN DIEGO STILL. THAT WE HAD NOT DONE IN SANTA BARBARA. WE BROUGHT OUR TRIBAL LIAISONS INTO THIS BILL MUCH SOONER WE IDENTIFIED AN OFFICIAL NONPROFIT ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP IS A LIAISON POINT ACROSS AND INTO THE- COMMUNICATION AND OUR REGION EDUCATION DOT WITH SURFRIDER. WE KEEP WITHIN ONE WEEK ON THIS BILL MORE DEPLOYED EXPERTS AND RESPOND EARNERS OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED WHICH WAS EXCEEDING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER WE DID IN THE SANTA BARBARA WHICH YOU JUST BILL WE HAD THAT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF THE ORIGINAL. I'M KIND OF STANDING UP TO THE UNIFIED COMMAND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM AND WE WILL LEARN FROM THIS BILL WITH YOUR HELP AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE MANAGING THE TECHNOLOGY. ON THE SOFTER. A WELL AND YOU DIRECTOR BONHAM AFTER JOE US IN FOR YOUR I JUST ENGAGE. ON BUT EMERGENCY RESPONSE NOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND LOOK TO LEARN FROM THIS DISASTER AND DAD DO BETTER AS WE- ARE AS WE GO FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE. I'M WITH THAT I THINK WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO OUR PANELISTS. DIRECTOR BOTTOM CAN YOU HEAR ME AS I'M TALKING. ACT I'M THROUGH WHAT WE'LL DO IS. ASK QUESTIONS IF THE QUESTION IS DIRECTED TOWARDS A DOCTOR BOND AND THEN WE'LL- HOLD THEM UP TO THE MIKE. ALL RIGHT SO. I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER REFI. AT THIRTY DIRECTOR OF BOTTOM ARE YOU ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE DIRECTED CHIU ADMINISTRATOR CALLING FROM OCTOBER OR DO WE NEED TO ALSO GET HIM ON THE LINE. LET'S TRY THAT KNOWING THAT MR COHEN HAD A FANTASTIC PRESENTATION AVAILABLE FOR YOU- I THINK SUPPLY HIS SLIDES- AS A SUBMISSION TO THOSE SPECIAL COMMITTEE AFTERWARDS WITH YOUR PERMISSION. AND HE'S ALSO ABLE TO HEAR AND SEE AS WE GO THROUGH THE CONVERSATION. AND I'LL FIGURE OUT A LIAISON WITH HIM AS WE GO THROUGH THIS OKAY WONDERFUL I WILL ADD IT AT LEAST ON MS DAVIS HAS A QUESTION. THAT WILL BE DIRECTED TO OSTBERG I'M GOING TO DIAL ADMINISTRATOR CALLING INTO MY PHONE AS WELL AND DAD. WHAT COLOR IS THAT WE ALL RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS AND YOU KNOW IF THE IF THE DIRECTOR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CAN ANSWER YOU KNOW WHOEVER CAN ANSWER I THINK IS FINE- AND MICHAEL I HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO- YOU KNOW TO. THE TIMELINE OF THE INCIDENT OF YOU KNOW THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION'S PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. SAFETY ADMINISTRATION OFFICE THEY ISSUED A CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER SAYING THE COMPANY RECEIVED A PRESSURE DROP ALARM AT TWO THIRTY AM. BUT THE PIPELINE CARRYING CRUDE OIL WAS NOT SHUT. DOWN UNTIL ABOUT SIX AM. ON SATURDAY AND NOTED. THAT MY OCCUR UNTIL NINE AM. THE STATE LAW CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION. IF THOSE TIMELINES ARE ACCURATE. WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK WE'RE AND THE CHAIR SOUGHT TO PATCH AND MINISTER CULLEN. I DROPPED IN NEW. ARE YOU QUESTION BUT LET ME ANSWER ANYWAY BECAUSE I HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE- ENQUIRING ABOUT. YOU WERE ASKING TIMELINE QUESTIONS THAT ARE INCREDIBLY RELEVANT IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC BUT ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPLICATED IN THE PARALLEL- EVIDENTIARY GATHERING AND INVESTIGATORY FRIENDS. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WALK WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE PUBLISHED RECORD TWO GAMES THERE APPEAR TO BE A VARIETY OF MOMENTS IN TIME. ON FRIDAY EVENING INTO SUNDAY WHERE THERE ARE POTENTIALLY INCONSISTENCIES WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOT HI DAD. BUT I'M ALSO LOOKING INTO WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN BECAUSE SOME OF THESE NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE STATE CRANCH RELATE TO POTENTIAL CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. AND FROM THERE I'M JUST NOT AT LIBERTY TO COMMENT FURTHER. I AGREE WITH MAYOR KERR. THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE AWAY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TO LOOK AT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER PLATFORM LOOK AT THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY MECHANISMS FOR PARTIES TO NOTIFY GOVERNMENT. ABOUT A POTENTIAL SPILL AND FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR A MORE STREAMLINED STRUCTURE CAN ALSO BE NOTIFIED LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL. DID ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU- I HAD THE SAME QUESTION AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS SO ALL ALL GO TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH WAS. IT'S BEEN WIDELY REPORTED THAT THE SPELL WAS LIKELY PRECIPITATED BY AN ANCHOR DRAGGING INCIDENT. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THE PIPELINES CONCRETE% CASING COULD'VE BEEN CRACKED AND THE PIPELINE DRUGS. SO SIGNIFICANTLY WITHOUT TRIPPING ANY SENSORS. SHARE I YOU KNOW IN HINDSIGHT I'LL JUST CONTRAST- UNLIKE THE- TALK ABOUT IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHETHER IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO ATTEND IN PERSON I KNOW- THIS IS EXTREMELY COMPLICATED BUT I COULD NOT HEAR THE IS SOMEONE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH I IS ASKING HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE WITH AN ANCHOR STRIKE THAT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED- THOUGH THE EXACT TIMING OF THE STRIKE IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. HER QUESTION IS HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THAT COULD HAVE RUPTURED THE CONCRETE CASING. OF THE- SO HIGHER ACTION SO CORRECTION ON THE QUESTION CAN YOU HEAR ME DIRECTOR BOTTOM. SO I AM NOT NOR IS OUR DEPARTMENT OR OSCAR THE PIPELINE JURISDICTION EXPERT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PIPE IS VERY SIMILAR TO YOURS AND OUTER CASING OF CONCRETE AND INNER KIND OF CASING OF METAL- APPROXIMATE THIRTEEN AND CHORES ON A CRACK- ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FEET OF THE PIPELINE WAS MOVED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE SHE ALSO CENTER. I THINK THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF- YOU KNOW THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY BEING SUBJECT TO A FEDERAL CORRECTIVE ORDER. THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION- THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF. YOU KNOW. KEELING WITH HOW TO REMOVE THAT SECTION WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR WARDENS MONITORING THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY THIS IS EVIDENCE FOR YOU KNOW POTENTIAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITY I COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW AND WHY THE PIPE ITSELF- YOU KNOW SUFFERED A POTENTIAL STRIKE OR WIDE STRESSED THAT WAY THAT'S REALLY A QUESTION PROGRAMS ARE. OR ARE STATE FARM MARSHALL IS A PIPELINE EXPERT. AND WE WILL BE AT WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AT IN OUR SECOND PANEL YES BUT MY QUESTION WAS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE MOVEMENT AND THE CAUSALITY UNDERSTAND THAT'S UNDER INVESTIGATION. BUT WHY WERE THERE NO SENSORS THAT INDICATED THAT THERE WAS SMOKE. I CAN- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. A LOT OF SENSORS OR ARE. NOT SUFFICIENT MONITORING RELATIVE TO THE PIPELINE OR QUESTIONS BETTER TAKEN TO THEM SO OR THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR BUREAU OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT. AGAIN A LARGE PART OF THIS DYNAMIC IS% FEDERAL JURISDICTION IN FEDERAL WATERS. PIPELINE I KNOW THAT'S A FRUSTRATING RESPONSE FROM US. BUT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND ALSO PER VIEW IS REALLY THRILLING TRIP PRACTICING FOR RESPONSE AND THEN DEALING WITH AN UPSET IN THE MOMENT. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BUT QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBERS EITHER FOR THE DOCTOR FOR ANYONE ELSE AT MR BLAME. HELLO DIRECTOR BOTTOM IT'S A GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN EVEN IF WE CAN'T SEE YOU- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- R. IS THERE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TODAY- THAT WOULD ALLOW BETTER RESPONSE IN THE DARK. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY BUT I CONFESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M NOT THAT BEST TECHNOLOGY EXPERT I AM. REPORTER THE MAIN KIND OF THE LACK OF RADAR IN THIS SPACE IT WAS A CONVERSATION IN THIS SENATE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. THIS IS WHY I RECOMMENDED I THINK THE ADMINISTRATOR ALWAYS SPORTS WE DO. THE REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP A YEAR SOONER THAN WE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE AND WE MAKE THIS NIGHT TIME ISSUE A SPECIFIC FOCUS AND I WOULD TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER. ONE OF THE AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONING ALSO COMING OUT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE A CONVENING WITH OUR EXPERTS IN OUR UNIVERSITY SPACE. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WHO ARE EXPERTS USE UC SANTA BARBARA SCRIPTS INSTITUTE UC SAN DIEGO. I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN WRAPPING AND OTHER IMAGERY TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO GO TO SOLICIT THEIR FEEDBACK AS WELL NOT JUST INDUSTRIES. THAT RAISES AN INTERESTING QUESTION- WE AT LAST YEAR FUNDED A- A WILDFIRE RESPONSE INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DO WE HAVE- ANY KIND OF FORMAL COORDINATED EFFORT AMONGST- ANY OF OUR- A PUBLIC- AT A HIGHER READ SEGMENTS ON THE ISSUE OF OIL SPILLS. YES AND A VARIETY OF WAYS BUT PROBABLY NOT ONE AND SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON LIKE SOME OF THIS TECHNOLOGY RADAR. WITH OUR UNIVERSITIES WE- HAVE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS UP AND DOWN THE STATE- MISTER BROWN B. EARLIER WITNESS MENTIONED HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE LA LONG BEACH FOR OSCAR TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WE ALSO HAVE IS YOU KNOW A FORMAL FONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OLD WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK- FROM THE WILDLIFE RESPONSE SPACE. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE EXISTING MODELS AND ASK AND ANSWER WHETHER WE SHOULD REPLICATE SOMETHING SIMILAR. IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD IN THE UNIVERSITY WORLD. AND WHETHER THOSE TO NOON- KIND OF MODELS COULD HELP US TO BETTER IN SCHOOLS. THANK YOU AND HAVE A DIRECTOR BOTH YOU AND- MAYOR KERR. SPOKE ABOUT THE. OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLANS AND- AFTER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL CITIES AND COUNTIES AND I- TOOK ADVANTAGE OF FOR A NOT DURING THIS MEETING TO SEND A TEXT TO SOMEBODY I KNOW- BACK FROM- MY MAYORAL DAYS- IN IN SANTA MONICA AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT- TO SEE IF SANTA MONICA HAS AN ORAL RESPONSE PLAN THAT IT BEING A- COASTAL CITY AND THE ANSWER IS NO- SO- I THINK IT WOULD BE- WHO BEST TO- TALK ABOUT THIS MORE AS- OUR BUDGET PROCESS MOVES FORWARD- I DO WANT TO- SAY THAT- I DON'T THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THIS I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY- MUCH AS WE DO WITH OTHER- CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. WITH RESPECT TO- OIL DRILLING- BUT- DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE COASTAL CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE FAR RESPONSE PLANS. AND EQUIPMENT. I DON'T NEARLY ALL OF MY HEAD I CAN DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE IN THE CHAIR'S OFFICE WITH THAT INFORMATION- WE DO HAVE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PRIMARILY STRUCTURED. THROUGH THE MAJOR PORTS ALONG THE COAST AND I THINK WE OUGHTA GO LOOK AT AND CONSIDER WHETHER WE NEED TO TAKE OUR EXISTING MODEL WITH HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SEE IF IT'S APPLICABLE AT THE CITY LEVEL AS WELL. AND I'D LIKE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE EXACT NUMBERS OF THE GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO YOU I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION RELATED TO. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING TO A RESPONSE TO BEST PREVENT AND RESPOND TO SPELL SO. AND AS WITH MISTER BROWN POINTED OUT THAT OSTBERG. IT HAS BEEN WHAT THIRTY ONE YEARS SINCE OCTOBER WAS APPROVED- SUIT I GUESS MY QUESTION DIRECTOR FOR YOU IS TO WHAT EXTENT HAVE OUR STATE AND ENTITIES FORCE THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE TECHNOLOGY TRAINING PROCEDURES MANPOWER LEVELS OPERATIONAL METHODS THAT MEET. THE TECHNOLOGY FORCING REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT AND FIVE WHAT MORE SHOULD WE BE DOING AS POLICY MAKERS TO ENSURE THAT THE- TECHNOLOGY FORCING LANGUAGE WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE POWERFUL IS BEING FULLY UTILIZED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING THE BEST THAT WERE REGULARLY UPDATING BEST PRACTICES AND BRINGING THOSE TO BEAR. BOTH IN PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. SO COUPLE THINGS CHAIRMAN AND- NO JOKE HERE THIS IS A QUESTION THE ADMINISTRATOR AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT AND HE- ACTUALLY. IT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC MOMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE- LAST DECADES. SO I DON'T KNOW THE ABILITY TO TOUCH TO HIM MORE I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A LIFELINE CALL TO HIM. WHAT HAS HAPPENED MOST RECENTLY NOT IN TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO ARE ALSO SWEET AND IMPROVEMENTS THE LEGISLATURE ANOTHER'S. THE FINDINGS STRUCTURE PROSPER HAS BEEN CHANGED RECENTLY WHICH ALSO LEADERSHIP TO ALLOW US TO ENSURE CONTINUED CAPACITY. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME CHANGES- IN THE DECADE UP IN DIRECTOR AROUND- INSURANCE ANOTHER BUT FISCAL REQUIREMENTS ON INDUSTRY WE'VE SEEN SOME CHANGES FOR- NOTIFICATION KIND OF DYNAMICS SO I THINK AT LEAST IN MY TENURE THE LAST DECADE I COULD POINT YOU TO SOME IMPROVEMENTS. ON THE TECHNOLOGY SPACE- I HEAR YOU I THINK THE LEGISLATURE IS CORRECT TO PUSH US TO EMBRACE THE FORCEFULNESS OF THAT STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND DO BETTER PUSHING INDUSTRY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEASURE COLIN COLIN IS THE ONE WITH THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THE PLACES WE HAVE PUSHED THEM ON TECHNOLOGY. OKAY LET'S DO THIS LET'S ADD DIRECTOR CAN YOU TRY I'M GONNA TURN AND ASK A QUESTION UNRELATED TO THIS OF THE CAPTAIN WEILAND- ON IT WHILE SOME DOING NOT CAN YOU TRY TO GET. I ADMINISTRATOR CULLEN ON THIS LINE SO THAT HE CAN. BONDS BOND BUT THAT QUESTION AND I THINK THERE WITH SOME OTHER QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ADMINISTRATOR COLIN IS BEST POSITIONED TO RESPOND OKAY AND- WE'RE TRULY A FAIL SAFE IF. YOU'RE ON YOUR PHONE THAT'S BECAUSE I MADE THE MISTAKE OKAY THEN I'LL CALL IT MISTER CONKLING AND GET A SMALL PATCH THE CURRENT DOWN TO GET THANK YOU- RIGHT. WHILE WE'RE WORKING ON ON THAT- CAPTAIN WELL AND- I WOULD. I. ABOUT IT OVER THE PHONE IF YOU HEAR OUR- HELLO. HELLO CURRENT. I'M GONNA MIDDLE. MISTER CULLEN. SURE ADMINISTRATOR CALLING CAN YOU HEAR ME. I CAN'T GET HIM. AT YES WE WITH THAT SORRY CHECK WE'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES LATER CULLEN COMING THROUGH THE- I HAVE CAUGHT UP THERE SO- WE ARE GOING TO HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM HIM. ADMINISTRATOR COLIN ARE YOU ABLE TO RESPOND TO MY EARLIER QUESTION REGARDING THE FIVE. QUITE STRONG TECHNOLOGY FOR THE LANGUAGE THAT IS PART OF OSTBERG HOW HAVE WE UTILIZE THAT AND HOW CAN WE AS POLICYMAKERS- ENSURE THAT WE ARE. USING NOT MORE FORCEFULLY MOVING FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY YOU HAVE. HOW CALENDAR OVERSTOCKS YES- THANKS MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT- TECHNOLOGY AND ADDED I REALLY- BY THE DIRECTOR OF IN OUR ONLY STATUTE WE ARE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE BEST ACHIEVABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CELL RESPONSE IN WALTER BROWN TALKED ABOUT PERHAPS ANYWAY AUDIENCE RECORD BONTA SAID IT YES BUT WHO IS VERY ACTIVE WHICH IS- WE DO COHOST- EVERY TWO YEARS. AT SOME POINT OUT A SINGLE RESPONSE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP YOU KNOW WE ARE PLANNING NOW IN LIGHT OF THIS STILL TO HOLD ONE PERHAPS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF CALENDAR TWENTY TWO. WITH ANY PARTICULAR NOT TO DETECTION ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT- I'LL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO- CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP TECHNOLOGIES AND WIND UP MISTER BLOOM WAS- A US SOLDIER BROWN HOPING OTHERS SEEING OUR STATE WIDE PRESENCE- ARE BEYOND THE COAST ADDING TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S WATERS WE REALLY LOOK AT IT AS AN EXAMPLE ABU CYNICALLY USES WITH MOVING WATERS THAT WOULD ALLOW WATER TO WONDERFUL WE STILL SLOW BUT CAPTURING THE OIL SERVICE NOTICES TECHNOLOGY THAT IS IMMERSED IN THE LAST. DECADE OR SO- THERE'S A COMPETITION I DON'T DISABILITY HOLLOWS CALL THE AS FAR AS YOU KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE IF YEARS AGO IT WAS A COMPANY THAT ONE MILLION DOLLAR PRIZE FOR IMPROVING THE DISK ARE SKIMMERS THAT ARE NOW GOING TO BE EMPLOYED I MANY CLEAN OFFICIALS SAW PERHAPS LARGE AND- BOB- SORT OF RESPONSE OR ALL PAYER IN A FOR WEEK. GOKONGWEI ALL OF THAT IN ABOUT CONSIDER OIL ON INITIATIVES OF THE WATER GAS NEW TECH SO WE'RE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ON WATER ON SHORE TECHNOLOGIES I THINK OF IT OPPORTUNITY. GOING FORWARD IT'S GOING TO BE. WE OPPORTUNITY FOR US AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE LEGISLATURE LAST WEEK BUT I HAVE TO GET. AND I THINK- CERTAINLY IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY HERE I THINK I'M GONNA CERTAINLY FOR ME FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE MOST BAFFLING. ABOUT THIS IS THAT NOW WE'RE LIVING IN A WORLD WHERE WE'RE SENDING. WHAT WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE TO MARS YET WE ARE UNABLE TO INSPECT AN OIL SLICK. UNTIL FIRST LIGHT- I THINK THAT KIND OF BOGGLES. PEOPLE'S MINE. AND FIVE. I THINK THAT THERE IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US IS CALIFORNIA WITH ENGAGEMENT WITH ART. I COULD I MAKE AN NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AS PART OF IT TO DEVELOP NEW AND MORE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO RESPOND MORE SWIFTLY AND MORE ROBUSTLY. I'M ARE THERE OTHER FOR MR CULLEN BEFORE WE- MOVE ON RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES THANK YOU MR COHEN JUST A QUICK QUESTION- WHAT CAN YOU- SUGGEST OTHER STATES DO THAT WE DON'T DO WHEN IT COMES TO OIL SPILLS SUCH AS GULF COAST STATES AND OIL PRODUCTIONS. THAT THE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO TAKE OFF FLYING ON THE M. IN AND FOR EXT ON WE HELP CERTAIN. ARE A THE CUTTING- YOU KNOW AND HE- NOT JUST WITHIN THE STATES FOR WORLDWIDE OUR OIL SOLD. PROGRAMS AND SO THAT WOULD BE AN INTERNATIONAL AREA THAT WE DO LAGGED AND ACCOUNTS UP PERCENT. OF OUR OIL SPILL REPORTS IN THE ARMENIAN ABANDONED OR WITH. THAT ARE ALONG THE COAST IN THE- IN ORDER TO HELP RIVER DELTA- THAT WE WERE NEED TO GET A POP GRIP ON THOSE AS A CITY IN THE K. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSES- EURO TO THOSE WITH. ARE PARTNERS. WITH A SEPARATE THREAT. NINE QUESTION BEFORE DIRECTOR AND WHEN IT'S TIME. I HAVE. A GOOD ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I THINK. DR BOND- IF THE OIL COME FOR NOT RESPONSE FOR THE OIL LEAK. AT THE CONCLUSION THIS AND- WARILLA AT THE OIL COMPLETELY AS US. ARE THERE NOT- IN. CHRIS ASSOCIATED WITH TANKER SHIPS BRINGING AN OIL FROM OTHER COUNTRIES WHOSE STANDARDS ARE NOT THE EQUIVALENT TO THE CALIFORNIA- WHAT ABOUT THE JOB LOSSES AN INCREASE IN THE COST FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU. IT WAS A INCOME I AM BUT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING- WHY TABLE RISING INDUSTRY AND WE NEED THEM IN RESPONSE AND HOW DO YOU CONSIDER THE BROADER ECONOMIC DYNAMICS. LOOK I'M NOT HERE TO INSPECT POLICY FLAG. KILLER ARENA. WE'RE CAST WITH DEALING WITH THE REST- THAT'S HAPPENING FIGHTING THIS BILL AND THEN LEARNING DURING THE NEXT TIME BUT I WILL YOU. DONATION IS MADE CAL LEADER ON THAT FOR TO FACE OUT THE OF FUEL FOR THE CARD CRISIS AND PROTECT EARNED BY. THAT'S GOT TO HAPPEN IN THE CON OF- PROTECTING IN. AND POSE THE- I THINK MAYOR- CAN SPEAKER ELOQUENTLY THE BALLOT OF. ALONG THE COAST AS WELL AS YEAR KNOW AND I THINK HE IS MANY OF THE- THAT APOLLO. STROLLER FIND BY. NOT JOB TO DATE. COMMENT ON WHY TO DO WITH AN INDUSTRY THINK WHEN WE THIS. WHEN WE PRODUCTION. WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO RISKS BUT ALL KNOWS BILL A GOOD IT ARTS IS IN MANY WAYS I'M NOT YOU TO BE FOR. HIGHLIGHTED IN THE MOMENT LEARN FROM EXPERIENCE AND. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT IS ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I DO AGREE WE NEED REALLY FOR ON UPGRADING TECH. THANK YOU FOR. AND I WOULD ISN'T BAD AS A MEMBER ON I DO EXT AS HAS A- RICH ROBUST DEATH. AND DEBATE- AS PART OF OUR SUBSEQUENT HEARING. ON YOU MADE THE POINT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT OFFSHORE DRILLING. HAS FOR THE STATE. I WOULD SIMPLY POINT OUT THAT OUR OFFSHORE DRILLING OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR. ONE THIRD. ONE THIRD OF ONE PERCENT. OF THE UNITED STATES OIL PRODUCTION. WHEN YOU COMPARE LEAVING ASIDE THE O'CLOCK LOGICAL BRISK LEADING IT LEAVING ASIDE THE DAMAGE THAT IT'S DOING TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. WHEN YOU SIMPLY COMPARE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE ACT. WITH THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SHUTTING DOWN OUR COASTAL ECONOMY IN ORANGE COUNTY OR IN SAN DIEGO ORANGE SANTA BARBARA OR SANTA MONICA. FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS. IT REALLY IS INFINITESIMALLY SMALL AND SO THAT IS I THINK WHY I WOULD AGREE. WITH THE POINT MISTER BROWN MADE WHICH IS THAT THERE REALLY IS AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR US TO WORK AND DEVELOP I THINK A COLLABORATIVE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY. AND TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN. THAT WE CAN AND AFTER DRILLING OFF THE COAST AND I. ABSOLUTELY WANT OUR COMMITTEE TO S. ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION- BUT- I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING I WANT THAT I WANT THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. TO BE WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE INTRODUCING. LEGISLATIVE AND PROPOSALS ADDRESS. SHORT TERM AND- WHEN WE RECONVENE THIS COMMITTEE I WANT US TO. BE VERY FOCUSED ON. A PLAN TO PHASE OUT. DRILLING ON THE COAST TO. WITH THAT I'VE GOT ONE QUESTION FOR OUR CAPTAIN WELLAND AT CAPTAIN I WANT TO PICK UP ON AT APPOINT THAT MAYOR KERR MADE REGARDING I AN OPPORTUNITY TO STREAMLINE COMMUNICATIONS IN ORDER TO. FIVE IMPROVE COORDINATION PARTICULARLY IN KIND OF THOSE THOSE EARLIEST HOURS I WOULD JUST LOVE TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND REFLECTIONS ON THAT AND IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE. SALINAS ARE. OF THE IN POINT OUT THAT THE FRIDAY I WAS AT THE- SHOW MY WORKING AT THE COMMAND POST AND THEN- GIVEN OPPORTUNITY FOR MY SERGEANTS TO WORK MY POSITION. BECAUSE I SAID NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON SATURDAY SO GO AHEAD AND- THE TAKE PETS A SPOT AND THEN OF COURSE IT DID BUT- WE WERE IN COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE CITY HUNTINGTON BEACH BALL FIRED POLICE AT THAT COMMAND POST IN THE U. S. COAST GUARD WAS THERE AS WELL. FOR THE AIR SHOW IN SO THAT'S WHERE WE INITIALLY- GOT THE INFORMATION FROM WAS FROM THE COAST GUARD OFFICIAL AT THAT AT THE AIR SHOW- IT IS GOING FORWARD WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS SOME KIND OF- COASTAL C. AND COUNTY. OIL SPILL REPORTING SYSTEM WHERE ANY COASTAL CITY OR-COUNTY COULD BE PART OF THAT SYSTEM. AND IN INTER INFORMATION WHEN THEY HAVE A HAZMAT NOT JUST OIL BUT ANY ANY LARGE BILL. COULD BE ENTERED INTO THAT SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFY ALL THESE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES ALONG THE COASTLINE. IN THE END SO THAT WE EACH OF THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES THEY NEED TO DEPLOY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE THE IMMIGRANT WITH THE AMERICA- IS MUCH INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS BETTER FOR- FOR A BETTER RESPONSE AND FASTER RECOVERY. THE ANY SITUATION IN THE IT WITHIN THAT SYSTEM THE COAST GUARD ANY. ANY OIL COMPANY OPERATING WITHIN- OUR WATERS CAN- REPORT THAT IN THAT THE- BED OR ANY TYPE OF OIL SPILL FROM THE SHIP LARGER THAN SAY A HUNDRED FEET MEANING CARGO SHIPS. OIL TANKERS AND SUCH IN A ANY OR PLATFORMS PIPELINES INTO THE SYSTEM. THAT WILL BE MY RECOMMENDATION BUT OTHERWISE I THINK- AT IS A PRACTICAL STANDPOINT WE DID WE WORKED AS AS QUICKLY. AND EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE EVERY SITTING COUNTY OFFICIAL LIKE I SAID WE MADE AS MANY NOTIFICATIONS EARLY ON. AS POSSIBLE AS WE COULD- BUT I THINK- IT YOU KNOW DO THEY HAVE AN OFFICIAL MESSAGE. FROM FROM- OF THE STATE A WHEN THINGS LIKE THAT HAPPEN THAT THAT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL. THANK YOU CAPTAIN. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS AND I THINK WE WILL BE GOING TO WRAP UP THIS PANELING AND TRANSITION. THANK YOU IF I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THAT COMMENTED SHE MADE- I DO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE STATE AS PART OF NOTIFICATION RIGHT AND WHICH MEANS THE STATE LEGISLATIVE BODY BECAUSE I ACTUALLY DIDN'T GET ANYTHING. I ACTUALLY GOT IT FROM THE CITY AND THANK GOODNESS THAT CITY HUNTER BEACH WAS ON TOP OF IT BUT AS THE INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY TO THE MEMBERS AND I ACTUALLY GOT YOU KNOW A DASH A TEXT MESSAGE FROM THE MAYOR HERSELF AND EXEDRA. THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL TO US BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE NEED TO BE COORDINATION NOT JUST COUNTY CITY BUT ALSO STATE THESE NOTIFICATION IN NOTIFICATION WE GET A LOT. OF FROM WHAT WERE WE ARE IN OUR POSITION WE GET A LOT OF OCCASION. DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERY NOTIFICATION WE GET WE SENT IT OUT TO THE PUBLIC WE ARE VERY MINDFUL WHAT IS SET DOWN WITH NOT SIMPLE MODIFICATION SAY HEY WE HEARD OF THIS AND WE THINK THIS IS HAPPENING WE DON'T KNOW YET I IN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL I WAS AT THE AIR SHOW. ON SATURDAY ALL DAY. AND PEOPLE COMING UP TO MIMIC WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT MINISTERS IN THERE SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IF THE WHERE. A. I. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN LIKE IT WAS MORE JUST LIKE COUPLE PEOPLE WALKING BY SAY HEY DID YOU HEAR THIS A. LOT I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING. AND NIGEL LATER THE- EVENING EARLY EVENING. EARLY AFTERNOON AS WELL WE HEARD THE CITY. SO ADDING IN ANY KIND OF NOTIFICATION PROCESS IT NEEDS TO GO TO A LOT OF IN YOU KNOW DIFFERENT AGENCIES. AND NOT JUST CITY AND COUNTY- BUT I DO HAVE TO. GIVE KUDOS TO THE TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND ALSO TO THE CITY. FOR YOUR- SPEEDY. GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO ALL OF US AND BREAK THEIR AT THAT MOMENT IMMEDIATELY AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THAT- I'VE GOT A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS MADAM CHAIR- I'M- MR POLLAN- WOULD WHAT WAS BOOKED EARLY BEFORE YOU GOT ON WAS ABOUT- THE CITY OF HUNDRED BEACH HAS A BOOKLET A BINDER THAT SHOWS HOW TO DEAL WITH OIL SPILL AND- J. BLOOM JUST CONTACTED ONE OF HIS CLOSEST CITY AND THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE SOMETHING. MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS FOR THE STATE SIDE BECAUSE WE HAVE- COASTAL BEACHES FROM STATE NOT JUST THE CITY IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE BOTH A CHICA STATE BEACH EDAD MY FORMER SENATE SEAT WE HAD THE HUNTER BEACH STATE BEACH AS WELL. SO DO WE AS A STATE HAVE ANY BOOKLET. THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW WE COORDINATE WITH CITIES AND HOW WE MOVE ABOUT CITIES AND LOCAL- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF RESPONSE TO AN OIL SPILL. THANK YOU- PRESIDENT BOND FROM EVERY MISSTEP ADMINISTRATOR THE MISTER COLON OKAY. HELLO OKAY I'M I'M I'M WITH YOU SO- AS- A DIRECTOR BONTA MEASURE EARLIER TOMORROW YEAH YOU REFERENCE THE- AREA CONTINUES PLANS RECALL EIGHTY WERE ARE PLAN THAT THE COAST CALIFORNIA WERE WORKING ON DEVELOPING ON IT ONE SEVENTY SEVEN OF STATE AS WELL YOU'RE NOT WASTING- YOU KNOW- SIX YEARS AGO IN YOU KNOW PLANS. INFORMATION THERE ONLINE THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO IS NOT FACTORED A PROBLEM UNIQUE ALL WEEK THE GOVERNMENT. PLANS IN. I FROM. SENTENCE OPERATORS. ALL LOCAL CONTACT. AND OFTENTIMES MEN TO COUNTIES IN LOCAL SOURCE THAT YOU CAN EASILY ARE ALWAYS INVITED. AND I WILL DO. JOB OUR END TRYING TO BE SURE THAT WE REACH OUT. YEAH- AND BETTER TO PULL YOU KNOW OFFICERS. IN MAINTENANCE FOR CLINTON I AM LOOKING AT- INCREASING THAT- POSTURES WILL. AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN AT DR BONHAM ALSO DID WANT TO RESPOND. TWO QUICK RESPONSES ONE THING WE DID IN THIS BILL WHICH WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER OUR PRIOR. A LOT BIGGER STILL IN SANTA BARBARA WAS WE MUCH MORE QUICKLY. ROTHROCK COUNTIES OF ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO AND SHOULD THE COMMAND POST AND A UNIFIED COMMAND. AND DEVELOPED A RHYTHM WHERE ALL THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EVERY OTHER DAY FOR A PERIOD WERE REPORTING OUT WHAT THEY WERE STRUGGLING WITH WHAT THEY WERE SEEING AND HOW THEY WERE HANDLING. SECOND WE DID THAT IN PART BECAUSE WE NEEDED TO COUNTY'S EXPERTISE ON PUBLIC HEALTH. YOU COUNTIES IN THIS BILL. IMPLEMENTED WATER AND SEDIMENT AND AIR SAMPLING SITES AND ROAMING MONITORING. OVER FORTY FOR SENTIMENTAL WATER QUALITY SITES FROM ON SHERMAN SAN DIEGO OVER EIGHTY- SAMPLE SITES AND ORANGE COUNTY WE NEEDED TO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AND ALL DIRECTLY A CLOSER TO AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT AND I TAKE RELATIVE SUCCESSES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND CHAIR CUTTING BETWEEN THE HOURS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WAS BE USEFUL. BUT I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHETHER ONCE A YEAR OSPREY DOES A WORKSHOP WITH COASTAL MEMBERS. BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR ME AS I WAS CALLING TO INTRODUCE MYSELF. EMBATTLED AT THE SAME TIME AND NOW WE'RE ALL STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME SOME OF THESE TOPICS ARE HIGHLY TECHNICAL AND I WONDER WHETHER A ONCE A YEAR KIND OF INFORMAL WORKSHOP WITH BOTH CHAMBERS WITH COASTAL MEMBERS WHICH IS HAVE OUR CONNECTIVITY A LITTLE BIT STRONGER YOU ARE FAMILIAR WHERE HE A LITTLE BIT BETTER PRE STILL. NOT DURING SCHOOL. THANK YOU FOR THAT SUGGESTION I THINK THAT IS AT A- EXCELLENT IDEA AND TAKE AWAY AS WE- COME OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION TODAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER I'M I'M NOT. SURE OF NOT DONE OKAY. I DIDN'T HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION I'M AND THEN VERIFY TO MOVE ONTO THE NEXT MEMBER IF I'VE GOT A COUPLE ACTUALLY JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH. THAT COMMENT- CHERRY BLOOM IF YOU CAN ALSO WATCH YOU'RE LOOKING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS. AS THE ACT DONE TO OFFER CONSIDERED THE ILLOGICAL AREAS AS WELL- ALLOWING THEM TO ALSO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE OIL SPILL BECAUSE THIS OIL SPILL IS DIRECTLY GOING TO. POTENTIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACT BOTH THE CHICA CONSERVANCY- AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CONSERVANCY IN ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL AND I'M SURE ACROSS THE STATE- BUT I THINK IF ALLOWING THEM TO BE INCLUDED. AND MOST OF THEM ARE NONPROFIT BOTH THE CHEEK OF THE NONPROFIT. MAY EVEN TO WORK WITH THE CITY TO HAVE THEIR OWN PLAN TO COURT WITH THE CITY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU. AND THEN- MEL JUST WANT ONE MORE QUESTION IS AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S EITHER- THE DIRECTOR ADMINISTRATOR- OR MAYBE LATER BUT IN REGARDS TO THE CARGO SHIPS. ARE THEY GIVEN NOTICES WHERE THESE PIPELINES ARE AS THEIR APPROACHING OUR SHORELINES IF SO WHEN AND HOW. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OUT THERE. AND NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT IT IS A CARGO SHIP. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S IT DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW OF IF THEY GET NOTICES AND WHERE THESE PIPELINES ARE AND IF SO HOW DID THEY GET THOSE NOTICES AND WHEN DID THEY GET THOSE NOTICES- BEFORE THEY LEAVE. WHEREVER THEY ARE OR AFTER POACHING US HOW DOES THAT WORK. IT MEANT OR DIRECTOR BONHAM OF WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ONE. RESPOND AND I CAN'T TELL WHETHER MISTER COLLINS ON OUR OFFICE AUDIO BUT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER AS TO THE QUESTION I THINK IT'S A QUESTION PRIMARILY TO UNITED STATES COAST GUARD RELATIVE TO MARITIME MANAGEMENT IN FEDERAL WATERS THIS. LARGE CONTAINERS COME INTO OUR PORTS. I'D LIKE IT'S A CHANCE TO. MAKE SURE WE CONNECT- QUALIFIED EXPERTS WITH YOUR OFFICE AND GET ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S OUR DEPARTMENT OR A STREET CORNER JURISDICTION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL TAKE THAT AS A AS A FOLLOW UP AS WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER READ US AND THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL THANK YOU I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR MR BROWN FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY COAST KEEPER- DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD ASSUME THAT OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS FORTY YEARS OLD WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. IS ARE THE IS THERE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THIS OLD ON OUR COAST. YES YOU ARE. THE OBVIOUS IS THAT WE HAVE AGING SYSTEMS OUT THERE IN THE QUESTION IS THERE THE MONEY BY THE OPERATORS TO KEEP THEM AT THE STATE THEY SHOULD BE- JUST. POINT IT IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THERE'S A R. O. V. DOES A SURVEY OF THE PIPES BETWEEN L. A. PLATFORM L. A. N. EUREKA. AND IN THE SURVEY IT CAME BACK AND SAID THERE'S TWO FIFTY FOUR TO SPARE ROOMS OF THE OIL PIPELINE COMING FROM LA. THAT ARE SUSPENDED THEY'RE NOT IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE GROUND- WATER PASSES UNDER IT- I'M NOT HERE TO SAY THAT'S A GOOD THING OR BAD THING BUT WHO REVIEWS THAT AND WHO DETERMINES AND- WHO. HAS CORRECTIVE ACTION IN MY FIRST THOUGHT IS A BOY THAT WOULD BE AN EASY CATCH FOR A BOAT ANCHOR- IF IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE GROUND. HIMSELF YOU KNOW YES IT IS IN AND THAT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR ISSUES IS. ARE THE OPERATORS DOING EVERYTHING THEY SHOULD BE DOING M. YOU KNOW I WOULD HATE TO THINK THEY'RE JUST WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN THEN THEY'LL FIX IT- AND THAT THAT THAT WE ALL LOSE. IN THAT AND SO- YES THAT'S WHY THEY NEED TO START A DIGGY DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS IN. RIGHT NOW. EVERY PLATFORM WILL SAY WELL OUR PLAN IS TO DO COMMISSION BY SUCH AND SUCH A DATE THAT'S BASED ON WHEN THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF OIL TO PUMP- M. M. A. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE NEED. TO DECOMMISSION AND YOU KNOW WE BROUGH WHEN WE WERE DOING THE BILL BACK THEN WE SIT DOWN WITH OIL COMPANIES AND IN THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGED TO TRY TO FIND A WAY. TO EXPEDITE THE DECOMMISSIONING BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WHEN OIL WAS IS EIGHTY FIVE NINETY DOLLARS THEY'RE DOING WELL IF THESE OIL IS UNDER SEVENTY DOLLARS A BARREL THEY'RE LOSING MONEY. AND IT'S CHEAPER TO RUN THAT WAS AT A LOSS REMIT IS. TO FACE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE HIM OUT. AND SO- YOU WHAT WE'VE WE'VE DEVELOPED THIS SYSTEM BUT WE CAN FIX IT. AND THE OIL COMPANIES WANT TO FIX IT TOO. SO IT DESERVED AS THE CHORE SAYING IT IT. YOU KNOW. OUR DON'T THINK NEED LARGE. TO BAN ANYTHING WHICH BASIS GOING TO REACH IN LAWSUITS AND M. ALLOWED BATTLE. I THINK WE SHOULD TRY COLLABORATION FIRST AND I'VE I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO AND DO IT SURE. BALK AT THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE. MISTER BROWN AND THAT TO OUR OTHER PANELISTS FOR JOINING US TODAY THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING PATIENT WITH OUR TECHNICAL HURDLES AND DIET CERTAINLY- FEELS LIKE A CONVERSATION WE WILL VERY MUCH CONTINUE IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. WITH THAT WE WILL TAKE A LIKE A TWO MINUTE BREAK WHILE WE GET OUR SECOND PANELIST AT READY TO GO AND JAM. I THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH APPRECIATE YOU AND THAT AND ALL YOU TO FORGE COUNTY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR. THANK YOU. CORRECT WE ARE BACK FIVE I WOULD LIKE TO NOW INTRODUCE OUR NEXT PANEL AT THE CENTER TO THE NEXT COLLEGE PIPELINE REGULATION AND SAFETY WE ARE BEING JOINED REMOTELY BY A COUPLE OF A PANELIST JENNIFER WE K&lt;c.cyan&gt; THE CASEY FROM THE&lt;/c&gt; CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION. MIKE RICH WINE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHAL. CHIEF JIM HAUSSLER FROM THE OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE FIRE MARSHAL. AND BILL KAREN WHO IS HERE WITH US IT NOT IN THREE DIMENSIONS FROM THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US I BELIEVE OUR OTHER PANELISTS ARE. ON THE PHONE I'M GONNA GO AHEAD OF MR CARRIM AND- AND TO BEGIN WITH YOU THANKS FOR BEING HERE. YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MY NAME IS BILL. THANK GOD FOR BOEING IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE HI MY FAILURE. WE'RE NOT LINE RUPTURED IT'S BUILT A QUARTER MILLION GALLONS OF GASOLINE INTO A CREEK AND HEAVILY USED CITY PARK THE ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE FAILURE AND THE SUBSEQUENT EXPLOSION AND FIRE STOLE THE LIVES OF THREE BOYS DAMAGE THE CITY'S WATER TREATMENT FACILITY AND BURNED ALMOST TWO MILES OF A SALMON STREAM THAT RUNS THROUGH THE CENTER OF TOWN. THE FAMILIES OF THE BOYS WHO DIED IN THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE SUCCESSFULLY PUSHED FOR THE FUNDING OF THE TRUST. AS PART OF A CRIMINAL PENALTIES PAID BY THE OPERATOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE. CREATING A PUBLIC INTEREST WATCHDOG TO IMPROVE PIPELINE SAFETY. THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST IS THE ONLY NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON PIPELINE SAFETY. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AS YOU WORK TO EXTRACT LESSONS FROM THE OCTOBER FAILURE OF THE AMPLIFY ENERGY PIPELINE AND DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO THE ASSEMBLY TO PREVENT ADDITIONAL SPILLS AND TO IMPROVE THE RESPONSE TO THOSE BILLS THAT TO HAPPEN. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS MY TESTIMONY ON TOOLS THE ASSEMBLY HAS TO REQUIRE MORE FROM PIPELINE OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA. AND ANY REGULATORY GAPS TO ADDRESS TO HELP PREVENT FUTURE SPILLS AND IMPROVE RESPONSE TO SUCH BILLS. I WOULD LIKE TO IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL TOOL TO ADOPT STRICTER REGULATIONS FOR FEDERALLY REGULATED INTERSTATE PIPELINES OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. THE FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION ACT ENACTED IN RESPONSE TO THE EXXON VALDEZ SPILL ALLOW STATES TO REQUIRE STRONGER PLANS THAN THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS UNDER OIL SPILL PREVENTION LOS. AS I OUTLINED VARIOUS REGULATORY GAPS I WILL IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHICH THE ASSEMBLY COULD POSSIBLY ADDRESS WITH THIS AUTHORITY. I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS PIPELINE SAFETY REGULATORY GAPS IN FOUR MAIN AREAS CONSTRUCTION SPILL PLANS INSPECTIONS AND WE DETECTION. THEN THE REGULATIONS STATE THAT ALL OFFSHORE PIPE IN WATER BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWO HUNDRED FEET IN DEPTH MUST BE BELOW THE UNDERWATER NATURAL BOTTOM UNLESS THE PAPER SUPPORTED BY STANCHIONS HELD IN PLACE BY ANCHORS OR HEAVY CONCRETE COATING. THIS FAILURE SITE WAS LOCATED AT NINETY EIGHT FEET IN DEPTH WHICH IS WITHIN THIS RANGE AND WAS AT ONE POINT COVERED IN CONCRETE. WE HOPE THE INVESTIGATION TELLS US WHEN THE CONCRETE COVER WAS DISTURBED AND BROKEN. AND WHETHER THAT WAS RELATED TO THE PIPES FAILURE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS FILM THE REGULATION ONLY APPLIES AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT ANY PARTICULAR DEPTH OR CONCRETE PROTECTION BE MAINTAINED OVER THE LIFE OF THE PIPELINE. WE HOPE TO SEE REGULATIONS UPDATED TO REQUIRE ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF DEPTH OR PROTECTION. IMPROVEMENTS TO SPILL RESPONSE PLAN REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN A PRIORITY THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST FOR YEARS. THESE PLANS ARE KEPT MOSTLY HIDDEN FROM OUTSIDE INPUT AND SCRUTINY. AMPLIFY HAD A SPILL RESPONSE PLAN IN PLACE THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED BY FEMSA. WE DON'T YET HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO KNOW HOW CLOSELY THEY FOLLOWED THAT PLAN. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE LAWS TO BE MADE HERE. THIS IS AN AREA I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA COULD USE ITS FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION ACT AUTHORITY. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA COULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON THIS BILL PLANS WASHINGTON STATE WHO'S DONE THIS. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER AGENCIES TO KNOW IF AN OPERATOR HAS PROPERLY IDENTIFIED SENSITIVE AREAS AND IS ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO PROTECT THEM AND WHETHER THE RESPONSE RESOURCES ARE ADEQUATE AND AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY MANNER. FEDERAL REGULATORS REVIEWING SPILL PLANS DO NOT HAVE THE KIND OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE THAT IS IMPERATIVE IN DETERMINING THE ADEQUACY OF A SPILL RESPONSE PLAN. AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS AMPLIFI CONDUCTED AN IN LINE INSPECTION IN TWENTY NINETEEN. AND TWO OF THE IDENTIFIED EIGHT ANOMALIES HAD BEEN REPAIRED BEFORE THE OCTOBER FAILURE. WE DO NOT YET HAVE INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER THE FAILURE SITE CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES. THE FILM THE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT RULES THAT APPLY TO THIS LINE WOULD REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA COULD AS PART OF ITS OIL SPILL PREVENTION LAWS REQUIRE MORE FREQUENT ASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER THE PIPELINE HAS MOVED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN FLOOR. U. S. CONGRESS AMENDED THE PIPELINE SAFETY STATUTES IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. TO REQUIRE ANNUAL INTERNAL INSPECTIONS BECAUSE PIPELINE ROUTE SURVEYS AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS ON A RISK ADJUSTED SCHEDULE ON CERTAIN UNDERWATER PIPELINES. HOWEVER IT DOES NOT APPLY TO OFFSHORE PIPE. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT NEW LEGISLATION EXTENDING THESE REQUIREMENTS TO INTEREST STATE OFFSHORE LINES UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE OFFICE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND WORK WITH YOUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO EXTEND THEM TO ALL UNDERWATER PIPELINES. IN THIS CORRECT CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER STATED THAT AMPLIFY OBSERVED A LOW PRESSURE ALARM ON IT SKATE A SYSTEM SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THEY NOTIFY THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER OF THIS BILL. LIKE MANY OPERATORS THE ONLY LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM THAT APPLE PIE HAS THIS PRESSURE SENSORS AS PART OF ITS SKATE A SYSTEM. ALL THE IN THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE IS THAT AN OPERATOR HAVE SOME SORT OF LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM. THERE ARE NO PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AS TO HOW SENSITIVE ACCURATE RELIABLE OR ROBUST THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE. ALASKA HAS UNDER ITS OIL SPILL PREVENTION LAWS ADOPTED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR ITS PIPELINES IN CALIFORNIA COULD WORK WITH ALASKA AS PART OF THE PACIFIC STATES BRITISH COLUMBIA OIL SPILL TASK FORCE TO CRAFT NEW PROTECTIVE LANGUAGE BASED ON HOW ALASKA HAS ACCOMPLISHED THIS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS TESTIMONY TODAY I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND TO WORK WITH YOU FURTHER AS YOU FIND WAYS TO KEEP YOUR BEAUTIFUL STATE. INCLUDING A TREASURE COAST LINE SAPER FROM PIPELINE FAILURES. AND HANK YOU MISTER PATTON. AT LET'S NOT GO TO AT JENNIFER LEE CASEY WHO'S JOINING US FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION.

IN OUR NINE INTERVIEWS YOU GET ALONG WORK WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE MARKET ROLE IN BY WEDNESDAY DE. PODER YOUR THE FLOOR. THANK GOOD MORNING TO MEMBERS MY NAME IS JIM ALL. AND I THIS IS DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHIEF OF THE PIPE STATE DIVISION. THANK YOU FOR MEDITATION TODAY AND NOT PURSUE. THIS WITH YOU. THE THIS. IS THE PRIMARY ROLE IN RESPONSE. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO WITH. THE OLDER IDEA OF. NUMBER FOR THE PIPE STATE OF IT. HER ROLE IN THE RESPONSE. MONITOR TRANSFER PIPELINE. TO ENSURE COMPLY WITH. PERFORM FIELD INSPECTIONS OF OPERATORS ACCESS. MONITORED REVIEW BODY PROTECTION PRACTICES PROCEDURES AND POLICIES. INVESTIGATE EVERY RUSHER EXPLOSION TRAIN AROUND THAT WERE FIRED FOLLOWING A PIPELINE UNDER THE PIPELINE SAFETY DIVISIONS ACCORDING. IT IS MANDATED TO PERFORM INSPECTIONS BASED ON THE FEDERAL CODE AND THE STATE OF. THE TIME FRAMES FOR INSPECTIONS CAN VERY BASED ON INSPECTION HIGH. AND INSPECT OPERATORS MORE FREQUENTLY IF NECESSARY TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. NOW HOW OFTEN ARE THE INSPECTIONS DONE AND WHAT PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO ENSURE THE SILENCERS SAY. INSPECTIONS ARE CONDUCTED ANNUALLY UNDER STATE REQUIREMENTS THE FEDERAL INSPECTIONS ARE PERFORMED EVERY FIVE YEARS DEPENDING ON A PIPELINE FACILITY HIRING WORKERS REALLY ARE ALL. IRISES LEADING MAINTENANCE ACTED MORE FREQUENTLY BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED ON THE FEDERAL MANDATE. REFUGIO AND HOW HOW IT IMPROVED ARE PIPELINE SAFETY PROGRAM. ID TWENTY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A SIZEABLE STILL ON LAND IT FLOWED INTO THE OCEAN IN SANTA BARBARA NEAR REFUGIO STATE BEACH. FOLLOWING THE SALE SEVERAL LONGER PASSAGE EIGHT EIGHT IS STRICTLY. STATE PIPELINE SAFETY LAW. EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY FOUR TWENTY SIXTEEN DAS WILLIAMS. RT IS THE BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY ON FIVE LINES THAT COULD IMPACT ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS OF THE COASTAL. SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES REMOTE- INCLUDE REMOTE CONTROL VALVES. THE R. P. F. PARTY'S WILSHIRE- AND EMERGENCY FLOW RESTRICTING DEVICES. LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS AUTOMATIC SHUTDOWN SYSTEM THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE TOP LEVEL- ITEMS THAT WE HAD A PROGRAM TRIES TO ADDRESS. SB FIVE TWENTY SIXTEEN JACKSON REQUIRED THE ANNUAL INSPECTION OF PIPELINES UNDER OUR JURISDICTION. THE PASSAGE OF THE STATUTE A LOT OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF. AND DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES TO BETTER EXECUTE THIS MAN IT IS MANDATED TO THE DUTIES AND GROW TO FILL NEW STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. STATE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SAFETY TECHNOLOGY APART MINDS AND MORE FREQUENT INSPECTIONS THAT REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS. THE FEDERAL PIPELINE SAFETY LAW SAID THE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS THE PIPELINE OPERATORS MUST COMPLY WITH. CALIFORNIA EXCEEDS THE STANDARD MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS IN SOME AREAS OF OUR STATE LOBBYING CLOONEY. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FOUR SB TWO NINETY FIVE. SO CONTACT ON HER CELL. THE PIPELINE ISSUES NOT UNDER OUR JURISDICTION BECAUSE IT IS AN INTERSTATE PIPELINE. OUR OFFICE ONLY REGULATE INTERSTATE PIPELINE. IN GENERAL TERMS OUR OFFICE ONLY REGULATE PIPELINES ARE LOCATED WHOLLY ON STATE LAND OR ITS STATE WATERS BARRING A FEW EXCEPTIONS. HOWEVER EVEN IF LOWER BY MINE LOCATED IN STATE WATERS OR EVEN ON STATE LAND OUR OFFICE WOULD STILL NOT REGULATE IT AND IT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE STATE INCREASE INSPECTION SCHEDULE AND TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOUND IN. EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY FOUR AND SB THREE NINE FIVE. THE PIPELINE WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT OPERATED A LOW PRESSURE BELOW THE STATE JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS. A LOW PRESSURE PIPELINE OPERATED A PRESSURE OF A LOW LEVEL IT IS NOT BECAUSE MENTAL STRESS BELOW A CERTAIN PRESSURE BATTERY. THE PIPELINE FROM LA OR WORRY HERE'S A DAY IN A LOW PRESSURE FIVE ONE. THE LEGISLATURE CONTEMPLATED PLATING LOW PRESSURE TRANSPORTATION PIPELINES I DON'T REALLY. HAVE JURISDICTION WITH SB. ONE SIXTY NINE TWENTY NINETEEN JACKSON. HOWEVER THAT WILL NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. UNDER EXISTING LAW WE DO NOT REGULATE LOW PRESSURE PIPELINE STATE WATER OR ON LAND UNDER THE MORE STRINGENT CALIFORNIA COAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFYING TODAY HE RESIGNED AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO YOU OUT WITH THAT ARE WE WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS A REMINDER WILL JUST EAT FREE IN INTEREST. DO YOU WANT QUESTIONS OF A MORE MINDFUL OF TIME. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RITA. THANK YOU I'M FIVE ONE QUESTION FOR THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST. WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE PAST WEEK DETECTION SYSTEMS AND HOW QUICKLY WOULD AN OPERATOR KNOW THAT THEIR SYSTEM COULD BE LEAKING. IT'S A IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION. THERE'S A COUPLE COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO A LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM. YOU KNOW ONE IS THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT THAT'S LEAKING VERSES- THE TIME PERIOD YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- SO ANYTIME THERE HAVE BEEN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR MORE STRICT STANDARDS PUT ONLY DETECTION SYSTEMS THEY'VE INVOLVED- RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTION AS TO WHAT KIND OF LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEY'VE BEEN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. SO ALASKA'S EXAMPLE IS- OPERATORS NEED TO HAVE A LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM CAPABLE OF PROMPTLY DETECTING A LEAK OF AT LEAST 1% OF DAILY THROUGHPUT. WASHINGTON STATE OF WASHINGTON HAS- ASKED THAT ALL LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS MUST BE CAPABLE OF DETECTING 8% OF MAXIMUM FLOW RATE WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES. SO THOSE BOTH SEEM TO BE KIND OF REASONABLE- OPERATORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REASONABLY MEET THOSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY I THINK THIS QUESTION WOULD BE FOR- EITHER OF THE- STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S- THERE'S ABOUT. FIFTY SIX HUNDRED MILES OF INTERSTATE PIPELINE AND- AND- I'M TOLD- AND IF THAT PIPELINE IS OPERATED AT LOW PRESSURE THEN THEY'RE SUBJECT TO A FIVE YEAR INSPECTION REGIMEN AS OPPOSED TO- ONE TWO YEARS THE STATE REQUIRES FOR. APPLIES THAT ARE OPERATED AT HIGHER PRESSURE THAT ESSENTIALLY CORRECT. EIGHT EIGHT YES SIR- ESSENTIALLY IT WAS UNDER STATE- REGULATIONS WHICH IS FINE LINE IS NOT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BE INSPECTED ANNUALLY BUT ONCE AGAIN- DUE TO SB ONE SIXTY NINE AND A CURRENT REGULATIONS WE WOULD NOT PAY EVEN OUR PROGRAM WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. FORMAT INSPECTION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA CODE BUT IT FALLS UNDER THE FEDERAL CODE SO WE WOULD HAVE INSPECTED IT AT THAT- FIVE YEAR INTERVAL AS WELL. OF FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WITH THE TWO OF THE- PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST. ARE WE ARE THE REASONS A PIPELINE OPERATOR WHICH USED TO OPERATE THE PIPELINE AT A LOWER CAPACITY OR PRESSURE WHAT WITH THOSE RACES BE- YES THERE ARE REASONS- IT COULD BE. THAT IS AN AGING PIPELINE AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME WEAKNESSES AND THAT IT CAN OPERATE MAYBE A LITTLE SAFER AT ALL AT LOWER PRESSURE AND- THEY AND NOT TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE THERE'S ALSO DEMAND REASONS OF WHY THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH PRODUCT THROUGH IT AT ONE TIME- STORAGE ISSUES THINGS LIKE THAT SO THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF REASONS OF WHY AN OPERATOR WOULD CHOOSE TO. RUN AT LOW PRESSURE AT WOULD BE OUR A- COMPARATIVELY- LESS RESTRICTIVE. INSPECTION REGIMENT B. ONE OF THOSE REASONS. I'M NOT SURE I'M I'M NOT SURE HOW BURDENSOME THAT INSPECTION REQUIREMENT WOULD BE IF THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO. HAVE THEM RUN AT LOWER PRESSURE OKAY THANK YOU. OTHER QUITE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVIES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- CHIEF OSTLER MENTION INCREASE REGULATIONS WERE PROPOSED VIA S. B. ONE SIXTY NINE JACKSON. AS THAT BILL DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE LEGISLATORS WHAT OTHER MEASURES NOT ADDRESSED IN THAT BILL COULD BE INDUCED NERDIST THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUR OFFICE AND STATE TO ENSURE WE FIND TROUBLESOME PLATFORMS AND MILES. I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS ARE THERE ADDITIONAL ITEMS IN THAT BILL THAT WOULD HELP. IS THAT A CORRECT STATEMENT. YES SIR- I BELIEVE THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD HELP US IN THAT- PROFIT IN THAT THE BILL ALSO- THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS THAT COULD BE REVIEWED IN ANY OTHER PART ONE AT THAT THE WE BELIEVE WOULD BENEFIT THE- REGULATORY ABILITY- THE STATE FARM ARE. I KEEP JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT QUESTION WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ELABORATE ON SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK THEY PROBABLY- DUE TO THE LIMITED TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE GOING ON WITH ME I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE BEST IF WE COULD- MEETING WITH YOUR OFFICES AND- DISCUSS THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. YES I THINK WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT AS A FOLLOW UP FROM TWO DAYS A CONVERSATION AND FIVE. IT CERTAINLY DID SOUND FROM YOUR TESTIMONY AS AS WELL AS AS FROM YOUR IS THAT THERE IS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO STRENGTHEN AND STATE REGULATIONS RELATED TO LOW PRESSURE PIPELINES IN PARTICULAR AND THAT THERE CERTAINLY MAY BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. I'M SO IS THAT AN ACCURATE CONCLUSION CHIEF. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY ACCURATE STATEMENT. ARSENE AND HEARING NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND PARTICIPATION AND I CERTAINLY THINK THAT THERE IS A LOT FOR US TO FOLLOW UP ON ON BOTH WITH THE STATE FARM MARK MARSHALS OFFICES WELL AS WITH THAT THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST- I THINK THAT THERE ARE. SOME VERY CONCRETE. OPPORTUNITIES AND PROPOSALS ON THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE FORWARD. THANK YOU CHAIR ONE QUICK COMMENT FROM THE EARLIER PANEL THERE WAS TALK ABOUT THE- MUNICIPAL OIL SPILL RESPONSE PLANS I WANT TO POINT OUT A POSSIBLE- FUNDING RESOURCE FOR THAT KIND OF WORK AND- UP IN THE HE'S BEEN DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT TODAY HAS A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM.

WE'VE THERE ARE A TWENTY THREE PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS THERE'S FOUR PLATFORMS IN STATE WATERS WHICH DOESN'T REALLY MAYBE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THAT BIG A NUMBER BUT EACH OF THESE PLATFORMS ARE CONNECTED TO. SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF PIPELINES SO THE MATH AND YES WILL FOLLOW UP AND ENSURE YOU THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S LIKE A SPIDER WEB IT'S A SPIDER WEB AND EVERY STRAND OF THAT WRECK WEBER.
