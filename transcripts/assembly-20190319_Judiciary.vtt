IF IT'S DETERIORATED IT'S A LEAD

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:55.953

COURT DECISION BASICALLY SAID.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.968
WHEN WE RAISED AN ISSUE WITH

OF THIS PROCESS.

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:21.979
YES THERE'S GOING TO BE A

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.414
BALANCING HERE.

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:26.317
AND A LANDLORD WHO HAS NOT

00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:28.252
FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA LAW WHO IS

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.855
NOT MAINTAINED LEAD PAINT HOME

00:36:30.922 --> 00:36:33.057

ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE.

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:37.261
AND YOU GET TO BRING A LAWSUIT

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.729
TO SEE CONTRIBUTION.

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.865
THIS BILL TAKES THAT AWAY IN

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:43.000
DOING SO IT CLEARLY VIOLATES OUR

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.936
DUE PROCESS RIGHTS GRANTED BY

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.270
THE APPELLATE COURT.

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:47.705
AND THE EFFECT OF THAT COULD

00:36:47.772 --> 00:36:49.540
RESULT IN A RE OPENING OF THE

00:36:49.607 --> 00:36:51.409
CASE BECAUSE THE CASE WAS BUILT

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.811
ON A BALANCING OF NOW THE

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.713
EQUITIES OF THIS BILL WERE TO

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.682
BECOME LAW ARE OFF.

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:59.483
WITH RESPECT TO TENANTS.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:02.320
THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THEIR RIGHT

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.789
TO A KEY PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:08.392
THAT THEY MIGHT USE TO BRING --

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:13.564
A A A LAWSUIT AGAINST A LANDLORD

00:37:13.631 --> 00:37:15.232
WHO HAS NOT FOLLOWED THE LAW.

00:37:15.299 --> 00:37:17.501
IN BOTH OF THESE CASES IN THE

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:20.204
LAWSUITS BY MY CLIENTS IN A

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.839
LAWSUIT BY A TENANT.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.374
LANDLORDS AND HOMEOWNERS WHO

00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:25.443
HAVE FOLLOWED THE LAW HAVE

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:27.878
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:37:27.945 --> 00:37:29.480
THEY DON'T NEED THIS BILL.

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:32.683
THIS BILL IS NEEDED BY LANDLORDS.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:34.852
WHO HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE LAW

00:37:34.919 --> 00:37:36.587
AND MY GUESS IS THAT'S PROBABLY

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:38.122
A PRETTY SMALL CHUNK OF THE

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:40.191
FOLKS WHO WHO THE APARTMENT

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:41.659
ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS?

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.194
BUT THESE ARE THE WORST OF THE

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.729
WORST.

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.731
ACTION A REMOVES THEIR

00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:48.766
RESPONSIBILITY TO CONTRIBUTE

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:50.134
AFTER COLLECTING.

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:53.537
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RENT. FOR

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:55.306
WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS.

00:37:55.373 --> 00:37:57.541
IT REMOVES THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:58.943
TO CONTRIBUTE TO CLEANING UP

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.177
LEAD BASED PAINT.

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.113
AND THEN IT REMOVES THE TENANTS

00:38:02.179 --> 00:38:04.649
ABILITY TO ACCESS WHAT MIGHT BE

00:38:04.715 --> 00:38:06.350
THE ONLY EVIDENCE LEFT.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:08.953
IF THEY WANT TO BRING A LAWSUIT

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.688
AGAINST THEIR LANDLORD BECAUSE

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:12.957
THE LANDLORD BROKE EXISTING

00:38:13.024 --> 00:38:15.760
CALIFORNIA LAW. FOR ALL OF THESE

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.695
REASONS WE WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:18.996

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:22.333
THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.735

BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:31.275
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:32.343
LEARNED.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.111

COMMITTEE WERE A PART OF WAS

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.051
THAT THAT PAIN COMPANIES.

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:41.552
HAVE THIS.

00:38:41.619 --> 00:38:43.020
INCLINATION TO WANT TO PASS

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.289

YOUR CONCERN THAT THEY'RE TRYING

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:54.098
TO PASS IT OFF TO OTHER FOLKS

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.800
AND GIVE AND DISINGENUOUS

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.134
PROPAGANDA.

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.703
THAT WAS.

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:01.072
SENT AROUND LAST YEAR ABOUT WHAT

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:02.206
THE ACTIONS THAT THIS

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:03.974
LEGISLATURE WAS TRYING TO DO.

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.844
I THINK THE CREDIBILITY OF THE

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:09.213
PAIN COMPANIES HERE AND THEIR

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.781
WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:11.549
THE PROCESS AND TAKE

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:14.051
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGE TO

00:39:14.118 --> 00:39:14.652
THE BECAUSE THE CERTAINLY IN

00:39:14.719 --> 00:39:15.853
QUESTION.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.621
SO THAT'S WHY THIS BILL.

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:20.257
ENJOY THE AND I RECOMMENDATION

00:39:20.324 --> 00:39:22.927
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:23.694
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:39:23.761 --> 00:39:27.364
SCOUTER.

00:39:27.431 --> 00:39:29.233
SOME I GUESS I DO KIND OF

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.468
STRUGGLE AT THIS BILL LITTLE BIT

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.803
AYE AYE.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.772
ON THE ONE HAND.

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:38.109
FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD LEAD --

00:39:38.175 --> 00:39:39.844
TO INCENTIVIZE MORE CLEAN UP

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.546
WHICH I KNOW WE WE DO NEED AND

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:42.913
YOU KNOW THIS.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:45.983
HAVING THIS IN PLACE WOULD.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.251
I THINK INCENTIVIZE A LOT OF

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:48.819
PEOPLE WHO MAY BE DO HAVE ISSUES

00:39:48.886 --> 00:39:50.621
WITH LEAD PAINT OR POTENTIALLY

00:39:50.688 --> 00:39:51.856
COULD HAVE ISSUES WITH LEAD

00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.090
PAINT.

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.058
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.826
PROGRAM DO ABATEMENT AND THEN

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.328
ALSO GET SOME LIABILITY

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.063
PROTECTION --

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:03.801
IN THE PROCESS --

00:40:03.868 --> 00:40:05.903
I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW.

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:07.972
PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE WHO APPLIED

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:09.440
LEAD LEAD BASED PAINT IN THEIR

00:40:09.507 --> 00:40:11.876
APARTMENTS --

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:13.911
PROBABLY AT THE TIME HAD NO IDEA

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:16.781
THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT.

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:18.249
COULD BE HARMFUL AT THE TIME AND

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:20.050
PROBABLY THE MANUFACTURE WAS IN

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.886
A BETTER PLACE. TO BE THE

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:23.187
DETERMINER OR MAYBE HAVE THE

00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.522
KNOWLEDGE.

00:40:24.588 --> 00:40:26.957
OF THOSE TYPE OF OF OF THE FAX

00:40:27.024 --> 00:40:29.093
SO.

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.161
YOU KNOW IT.

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:31.762
IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT YOU YOU

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:32.396
KNOW YOU'D PUT MORE

00:40:32.463 --> 00:40:34.031
RESPONSIBILITY UPON THE

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:36.167
MANUFACTURE AND THOSE TYPE OF

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.969
SITUATIONS --

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.005
HOWEVER I MEAN I DO THINK MISTER

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:44.708
MOFFETT MAKES A GOOD POINT THAT --

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:47.178
YOU KNOW THERE IS EXISTING LAW.

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.046
WITH REGARD TO LEAD BASED PAINT

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.681
THAT EVERYBODY AT LEAST NOW AND

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:52.483
IN MODERN TIMES KNOWS ABOUT THAT

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:53.818
YOU DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:55.186
ABOUT.

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.754
A DETERIORATING --

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.857

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:03.994
ARE WE BY THIS BILL --

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:05.563
SOMEHOW KIND OF RELIEVING THEM

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:07.131
OF THE OF THE LANDLORD OF THEIR

00:41:07.198 --> 00:41:08.199
RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.034
THOSE --

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.001
TYPE OF ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THAT

00:41:11.068 --> 00:41:14.071
THEY PROBABLY DID NOT KNOW OF IT

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:15.973
WHEN THE PAINT WAS APPLIED AND

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.341
YOU KNOW MANY YEARS LATER.

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:19.109
ARE ARE NOW HAVING TO DEAL WITH

00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:20.144
THIS ISSUE.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:21.245
THERE STILL IS A LEGAL

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:24.315
RESPONSIBILITY CAN YOU MAYBE

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:25.683
SPEAK TO THAT MR CHIU AND LIKE.

00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:29.053
I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS.

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:30.020
HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT I

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:31.589
GUESS PROJECT?

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.390
PROJECT THE QUESTION AND I KNOW

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.658
MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE NOT ON

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:35.926
COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WHEN THIS

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:37.561
COMMITTEE CONSIDER THIS NOW JUST

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:37.995
NOTE.

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:39.730
THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTED THIS

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:40.598
BILL.

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:41.966
TEND.

00:41:42.032 --> 00:41:43.200
TO ZERO IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:44.602
AFTER HEARING A WAY IN ALL THE

00:41:44.668 --> 00:41:46.237
ARGUMENTS AND IT ACTUALLY WENT

00:41:46.303 --> 00:41:47.771
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WENT TO

00:41:47.838 --> 00:41:48.973
THE ASSEMBLY --

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.208
IT WAS VOTED ON UNANIMOUSLY IN A

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.843
BIPARTISAN WAY OFF THE SOME AND

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.478
I THINK YOU REMEMBER THAT.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.045
AND I WILL MENTION THAT LAST

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.580
FROM COMMITTEE THE OPPOSITION

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:58.182
DID NOT RAISE ANY OF THESE

00:41:58.249 --> 00:41:59.817
ISSUES AS THIS BILL WENT THROUGH --

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:01.819
BUT TAKE TO GET YOUR POINT AS

00:42:01.886 --> 00:42:03.554
THE EVIDENCE CLEARLY SHOW DURING

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:06.457
TWENTY YEARS OF LITIGATION --

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.859
CONSUMERS TO HAD NO IDEA WHAT

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.494
WAS THE MANUFACTURERS WHO HID

00:42:10.561 --> 00:42:12.296
THAT EVIDENCE FOR MANY MANY

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.632
DECADES AND IT FINALLY ALL CAME

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:16.901
TO LIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS LAWSUIT.

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:17.935
I ALSO WOULD POINT TO THE

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.036
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHICH IS VERY

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:21.672
THOROUGH WHICH STATES.

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:23.173
THAT PROTECTING PROPERTY OWNERS

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.408
FROM LIABILITY DOESN'T LIMIT

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.277
LEGITIMATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:27.211
PAIN COMPANIES TO SEEK

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:28.746
MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.147
CREATION OF A NUISANCE.

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.283
SO THAT IS PERMITTED IN I THINK

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:33.550
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS RELIED ON

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:35.352
BY THE OPPOSITION --

00:42:35.419 --> 00:42:37.187
IS IS BEING READ IN A VERY

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:39.890
NARROW WAY NOT IN THE CONTEXT --

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:41.358
WITHIN THIS DECISION ALSO

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.927
MENTIONED BECAUSE I HAD NOT

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.428
HEARD THIS ARGUMENT BEFORE BUT

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.263
THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS WOULD

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.832
IMPACT TENANTS IN A NEGATIVE WAY.

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:50.167
WE HAVE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.236
FROM THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE

00:42:52.303 --> 00:42:53.570
TENANTS COMMUNITY.

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.773
AND WE ARE CONCERNED HERE THE

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:56.573
REASON WE NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.241
THIS BILL.

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.776
IS IF THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:00.778
ARE ALLOWED TO SUE EVEN ONE

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:01.812
HOMEOWNER.

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.080
THAT WILL CREATE AN ENORMOUS

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:04.982
CHALLENGE AFFECT THAT DETERS

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.550
OTHER HOME OWNERS AND THEIR

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:08.152
TENANTS FROM BEING ABLE TO

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:10.154
BENEFIT FROM LEAD PAINT Là

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.689
PAINT ABATEMENT PROGRAMS WHICH

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.223
WILL FURTHER LEAD TO THE

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.959
POISONING OF NEW GENERATIONS OF

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:19.263
KIDS AND FAMILIES SO THAT IS

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:20.731
WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:21.365
THE REAL QUICK IS IT JUST A IS

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:21.832
IT A SHE'LL JUST FROM

00:43:21.899 --> 00:43:22.499
CONTRIBUTION IS THAT REALLY WHAT

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.434
THE SHIELD JUST FROM

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.969
CONTRIBUTION ACTIONS.

00:43:25.035 --> 00:43:26.236
IS THAT RIGHT.

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:29.907
YES IT IS IT'S FOR CONTRIBUTION

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:32.409
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:35.679
IS SO NARROW IS THAT AND

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:37.548
TYPICALLY THERE REALLY.

00:43:37.614 --> 00:43:38.782
THESE THREATS OF CONTRIBUTION

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:40.584
LAWSUITS DON'T HAVE ANY MERIT

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:41.819
THE COURT OF APPEALS IN OUR

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.721
LAWSUIT DID NOT SAY THAT THEY

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.990
HAVE A RIGHT OR DUE PROCESS

00:43:46.056 --> 00:43:47.658
RIGHT. TO BRING.

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.293
ADDITIONAL CASES IT WAS DICK

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.795
DATA AS INDICATED ON PAGE SEVEN

00:43:51.862 --> 00:43:53.897
OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS AND IN

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:55.366
ORDER TO BE IT CODE PORT FEES

00:43:55.432 --> 00:43:56.900
ARE OR TO BE LIABLE FOR

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.736
CONTRIBUTION YOU HAVE TO HAVE

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.137
CONTRIBUTED TO THE PUBLIC

00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:00.804
NUISANCE.

00:44:00.871 --> 00:44:02.906
HERE THE PUBLIC NUISANCE WAS THE

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:05.342
MANUFACTURE DISTRIBUTION AND

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:08.012
PROMOTION VIA ADVERTISEMENTS OF

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.747
LEAD PAINT NO INDIVIDUAL

00:44:09.813 --> 00:44:12.216
HOMEOWNER PARTICIPATED IN.

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:14.818
BUT ANY RATIONAL HOMEOWNER WHO'S

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:16.353
AFRAID OF BEING SUED BY LEAD

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.723
PAINT COMPANY WOULD PROBABLY.

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.058
TAKE A STEP BACK AND HAVE A

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:21.992
SECOND THOUGHT ABOUT

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:23.794
PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM IF

00:44:23.861 --> 00:44:24.395
THAT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:26.096
GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE CAN'T LET

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.798
THAT HAPPEN THIS IS BASICALLY.

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:30.234
THE LEAD PAINT COMPANY IS TRYING

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.202
TO GET OUT OF THE JUDGMENT AFTER

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:33.771
THEY'VE ALREADY LOST APPEALS AT

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:36.140
THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL

00:44:36.206 --> 00:44:36.740
AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

00:44:36.807 --> 00:44:37.474
COURT.

00:44:37.541 --> 00:44:38.542
BY TRYING TO GET THEIR MONEY

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:40.744
BACK ON THE BACK AND BY SCARING

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:43.013
PEOPLE FROM TAKING IT.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.782
WILL BUT THE COURT DID SAY.

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:46.517
YOU KNOW IN THE END THE DECISION

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:47.651
FOR THE MORE NOTHING PRECLUDES A

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.286
DEFENDANT FROM TESTING THE LEAD

00:44:49.353 --> 00:44:50.888
PAINT AT SPECIFIC LOCATIONS

00:44:50.954 --> 00:44:52.689
DURING THE REMEDIATION PROCESS

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:53.724
AND SEEKING TO HOLD A FELLOW

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.426
DEFENDANT LIABLE FOR A GREATER

00:44:55.492 --> 00:44:56.894
SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.429
RIGHT WAS IN THE COURT SORT OF

00:44:58.495 --> 00:44:59.696
OPENING THAT UP THAT.

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:01.932
THAT THAT COULD BE THE CASE ALL

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:02.933
OF FELLOW DEFENDANT WOULD BE

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.402
ANOTHER LEAD PAINT COMPANY IT

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:07.471
WOULD NOT BE A HOMEOWNER.

00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:11.575
AND THEN THE THESE CONTRIBUTIONS

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:12.843
COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.945
HOMEOWNERS INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:16.847
AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WE SEEM TO

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:20.884
BE FOCUSED ON APARTMENTS RIGHT

00:45:20.951 --> 00:45:22.886
AND YOU KNOW LARGE TENET

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:25.589
COMPLEXES BUT THIS.

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.091
THIS WOULD ALSO BE A SHIELD FOR

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.625
INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WHO

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.294
APPLIED TO LEAD PAINT CRACKED

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.463
WITHOUT A. B. TWO OH SIX TO

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.064
PROTECT ALL HOMEOWNERS THE LEAD

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.632
PAINT COMPANIES COULD SUE ANY

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.301
HOMEOWNER INCLUDING.

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:39.203
AN INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR SINGLE

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:40.971
FAMILY RESIDENCE.

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:42.639
AND THEN JUST TO MISTER MOFFETT

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:43.974
I'D I WOULD BE HAPPY MAYBE

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:46.110
RESPOND A COUPLE OF THESE THINGS --

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:47.845
BUT SPECIFICALLY YOU SAID THAT

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.179
THEY COULD USE THIS TO COVER UP

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:51.448
EVIDENCE.

00:45:51.515 --> 00:45:53.283
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.752
HOW WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT

00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:56.353
LIKE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

00:45:56.420 --> 00:45:56.820
WHEN YOU'RE SAYING?

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.322
NO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

00:45:58.388 --> 00:46:02.392
DID NOT SAY COVER UP EVIDENCE.

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:03.327
ONE OF THE VERY PLEASED PLEASE

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.728
CLICK ON THE THE YOU KNOW IT AND

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:06.830
AND AND ADDRESSING THE THE

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.365
EARLIER ISSUE I MEAN.

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:10.100
THE THE THE QUOTE YOU READ FROM

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:11.201
THE APPELLATE COURT IS CORRECT

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:12.402
BUT YOU LEFT OFF THE LAST

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:13.604
SENTENCE WHICH IS.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:14.938
YOU KNOW THE THE COURT TALKED

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:17.908
ABOUT THEY'RE LIABLE PAINT

00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:20.177
COMPANIES THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.745
SEE CONTRIBUTION FROM.

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:23.247
BUT THEN THE COURT WENT ON TO

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:24.715
SAVE IN THIS SENSE DIRECTLY

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:27.851
AFTER THAT THE SAME IS TRUE OF

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:28.418
EVIDENCE THAT THE HAZARDOUS

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:29.620
CONDITION.

00:46:29.686 --> 00:46:31.622
IS THE OWNER'S FAULT OR THAT IT

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.957
IS NOT HAZARDOUS I DO SEE THAT

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:35.792
IT SAYS THAT AND SO YOU KNOW

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:38.028
THAT IS THAT'S I THINK THE KEY

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:40.097
POINT OF OF THAT DECISION AGAIN

00:46:40.164 --> 00:46:41.498
IT ALL COMES BACK.

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.300
TO DID THE HOMEOWNER FOLLOW

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:45.202
EXISTING LAW THIS IS SEPARATE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:46.870
AND ASIDE FROM THIS CASE

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:48.071
EXISTING LAW.

00:46:48.138 --> 00:46:50.507
PUTS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ON A

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:52.109
LANDLORD ON A HOMEOWNER TO

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:54.845
MAINTAIN LEAD BASED PAINT IF

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.281
IT'S INTACT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:57.814
WORRY ABOUT IF THEY HAVE

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.683
MAINTAIN THEIR HOME THEY HAVE

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.084
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

00:47:01.151 --> 00:47:03.020
IF THEY HAVE NOT IF IT IS

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:06.323
DETERIORATED THERE MIGHT BE SOME

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.659
SOME CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:10.360
SINCE SOME COMPARATIVE FAULT.

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:13.063
SOME CONTRIBUTIONS THAT IS DUE

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.632
TO THE FUND BECAUSE THEY FAILED

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:16.934
TO FOLLOW.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.502
WHAT HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR THE

00:47:18.569 --> 00:47:20.437
LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THE STATE

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.538
OF CALIFORNIA?

00:47:21.605 --> 00:47:24.074
ALL OF THESE FOLKS CAN CLEAN

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:26.109
THIS STUFF UP TODAY AND LOCAL

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.644
GOVERNMENT HAS THE AUTHORITY AND

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:30.080
POWER IN LAW TO FORCE.

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.715
HOMEOWNERS WITH DETERIORATED

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:34.151
DETERIORATED LEAD PAINT TO FORCE

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.520
THEM TO CLEAN IT UP.

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:36.954
TODAY.

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.156
AND IF THEY WOULD DO THAT TODAY.

00:47:39.223 --> 00:47:40.357
THEY DON'T EVER NEED TO WORRY

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.626
ABOUT THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:44.361
EVIDENCE QUESTION --

00:47:44.428 --> 00:47:45.996
YOU KNOW SECTION B. E. OF THE

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.832
BILL DEALS WITH PARTICIPATION IN

00:47:48.899 --> 00:47:50.500
THE REMEDIATION PROGRAM AND

00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.135
WHETHER THAT CAN BE USED AS

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:56.006
EVIDENCE. FOR IMMUNITY FROM

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:59.610
EXISTING OR OTHER PORTIONS OF

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.245
EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW.

00:48:01.311 --> 00:48:03.013
AGAIN YOU KNOW IS THAT OUR

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.915
LAWSUIT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:07.150
THINK SO THAT'S POTENTIALLY

00:48:07.217 --> 00:48:08.385
ATTENDANCE LAWSUIT.

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:10.053
AND AT TEN IT MIGHT LOOK AT THAT

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.755
AND SAY WELL LOOK YOU KNOW I

00:48:11.822 --> 00:48:13.624
DIDN'T KNOW ALL THE I WAS BEING

00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.092
BECAUSE THIS HARM.

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.693
BECAUSE THE HOME WAS IN A LEAD

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:18.495
PAINT WAS IN A DETERIORATED

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.897
CONDITION BECAUSE THE LANDLORD.

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:22.399
FAILED TO MAINTAIN IT

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:22.699
[inaudible]

00:48:22.766 --> 00:48:26.036
BUT THE ONLY EVIDENCE I HAVE

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.504
BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN MY HOME

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:28.672
I'M NOT WROTE RUNNING AROUND

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.775
COLLECTING EVIDENCE FOR FUTURE

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:33.043
THAT THIS EXISTED.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.811
ARE THE INSPECTION RECORDS AND

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:36.446
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ALONG WITH

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:37.681
PARTICIPATION THE REMEDIATION

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:39.249
PROGRAM.

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.151
AND SO IN SOME WAYS I DON'T

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:42.519
BELIEVE IT'S A COVER UP OF

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:45.122
EVIDENCE BUT THE BILL IS A BAR.

00:48:45.188 --> 00:48:46.490
OF WHAT COULD BE A KEY PIECE OF

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:48.025
EVIDENCE FOR A TENANT IN

00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:49.393
BRINGING A FUTURE LAWSUIT

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:52.696
AGAINST A A RECALCITRANT LAND

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.564
LAND LANDLORDS WHO ISN'T

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.366
FOLLOWING EXISTING CALIFORNIA

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.135
LAW ASIDE FROM THE CASE MAYBE

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.202
JUST TO CLEAR SO WHAT ARE YOU

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.203
SEE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.204
DURING IF SOMEONE.

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.340
PARTICIPATES IN THE REMEDIATION

00:49:03.407 --> 00:49:04.207
PROCESS.

00:49:04.274 --> 00:49:07.210
AND AS MAYBE THERE'S PICTURES OR

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:08.478
SOMETHING AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:49:08.545 --> 00:49:10.580
REMEDIATION PROCESS THAT SHOWS

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:12.182
THAT WAS IN A DETERIORATED

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:14.851
CONDITION --

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:17.421
THAT UNDER THIS BILL --

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.221
BECAUSE THAT WAS PART OF THE

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.457
REMEDIATION PROCESS IT CAN'T BE

00:49:20.524 --> 00:49:22.092
USED AS EVIDENCE BY.

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.061
OTHERS BRING IN AN ACTION THE

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.296
REMEDIATION PROGRAM OUTLINED BY

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:27.364
THE COURT.

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:30.467
REQUIRES AN INSPECTION.

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.969
BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR OTHER

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:34.237
OFFICIAL CHARGED YOU KNOW THAT

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.706
THEY DID THE JURISDICTIONS

00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:37.107
DECIDE SHOULD.

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:38.875
CONDUCT THOSE INSPECTIONS AND

00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:39.910
THEN GO THROUGH AND DO THE

00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:41.311
REMEDIATION.

00:49:41.378 --> 00:49:43.613
AND SO WHATEVER EVIDENCE IS

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:45.082
GATHERED AS PART OF THAT

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.083
INSPECTION.

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:48.085
THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:49.920
LEVEL OF REMEDIATION IS DED

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.321
IN THAT HOME.

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.356
OUR READ OF THE BILL IS THAT

00:49:52.422 --> 00:49:55.459
NONE OF THAT USED.

00:49:55.525 --> 00:49:58.428
AS EVIDENCE THAT THE HOME WAS A

00:49:58.495 --> 00:49:59.863
NUISANCE WAS THAT STANDARD

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.631
VIOLATED EXISTING HEALTH AND

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:04.334
SAFETY CODE IS UNTENABLE.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:06.670
AND AND A HOME BEING UNTENABLE

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:08.338
BRINGS ALONG WITH THAT RIGHTS.

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:16.279
FOR TENANTS [inaudible]

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.782
LAUREN.

00:50:25.555 --> 00:50:26.823
THANK YOU.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.425
I JUST FIND THIS DISCUSSION KIND

00:50:28.492 --> 00:50:30.360
OF ASTONISHING AFTER LAST YEAR

00:50:30.427 --> 00:50:32.062
WHEN AGAIN IT WAS THE PAIN

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:33.330
COMPANIES TRY TO FOIST OFF ON

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:35.065
THE VOTERS.

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:37.501
THEIR LIABILITY AND THEY CREATED

00:50:37.567 --> 00:50:39.202
THIS VAST PROPAGANDA MACHINE

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:40.804
LAST YEAR AS WELL TRYING TO

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.472
SCARE HOMEOWNERS INTO THINKING

00:50:42.539 --> 00:50:43.640
THAT THE COURT.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:45.776
HAD HELD THAT THE HOMES

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:48.011
THEMSELVES WERE THE NUISANCE

00:50:48.078 --> 00:50:49.679
WHEN IT WAS IN FACT.

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:51.314
THE SALE OF THE LEAD PAINT THAT

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.482
WAS THE NEW SINCE I THINK THE

00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:54.384
COURT WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:54.684
[inaudible]

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:56.420
AND AGAIN.

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:58.789
THE ARGUMENTS DEPEND ON OF THE

00:50:58.855 --> 00:50:59.856
ARGUMENTS OPPOSITION REALLY

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.191
DEPEND ON THAT OBFUSCATION AND

00:51:01.258 --> 00:51:03.727
THAT SAME.

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:05.262
DESIRE TO PASS THE BUCK.

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:06.696
BECAUSE THERE'S THE COURT

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.265
DECIDED TO PUT A LIMITED TIME

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:08.999
FRAME.

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.767
THAT'S WHAT'S AT RISK HERE IF WE

00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:11.902
HAD MUCH LONGER TO DEAL WITH I

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:14.571
THINK WE WE COULD START TO PARTS

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:16.573
OF THESE ARGUMENTS MORE FINELY

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.108
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S WORTH

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:18.275
IT.

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.577
AT THE END IN ANY CASE BUT NOW

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:22.112

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.513
SHORT TIME I'M TO GET THE MONEY

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:26.683
THAT MONEY.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.820
BEING SPENT AND GET ACTUAL

00:51:29.886 --> 00:51:31.121
REMEDIATION ARE COMMUNITIES.

00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:32.189
IS HARM TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:51:32.255 --> 00:51:33.223
THAT'S WHY I THINK WE SHOULD BE

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.826
STANDING UP FOR THAT'S THE

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.628

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:07.684
THAT WAS PASSED OF THIS

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:11.187
LEGISLATURE ROUND TWO LIKE MANY

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.756
PEOPLE ARE AT THIS POINT.

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.190
OUR LEGISLATURE PASSES SOME OF

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.825
THE STRONGEST WORKER PROTECTIONS

00:53:15.892 --> 00:53:17.961
IN THE COUNTRY BUT THOSE LAWS

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.029
ARE WORTHLESS IF THEY CAN'T BE

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.463
ENFORCING COURT OR BY THE STATE

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.032
AGENCIES BECAUSE EMPLOYER HAS

AWAY THEIR RIGHTS IN AN

00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:25.969
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:27.537
THIS INCLUDES VIOLATION SUCH AS

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:32.976
WAGE THEFT.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:34.344
MANDATING THAT EMPLOYEES GO TO

00:53:34.411 --> 00:53:35.579
ARBITRATION IS A PRACTICE THAT

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:36.713
ALLOWS COMPANIES TO FORCE

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.048
EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS INTO

00:53:38.114 --> 00:53:39.349

00:53:45.388 --> 00:53:47.190
ARBITRATION CAN BE A HIGHLY

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.325
EFFECTIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.260
METHOD WHEN BOTH PARTIES CHOOSE

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:52.395
IT FREELY IS FAR LESS SUCCESSFUL

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:53.863
WHEN THE MORE POWERFUL PARTY

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:55.498
FORCES THE OTHER TAKES UP TO THE

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:56.399
TERMS.

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.068
THAT IS WHY AB FIFTY ONE DOES

FEDERATION WHEN THE CO SPONSORED

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.184
THE BILL WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR

00:55:21.251 --> 00:55:21.785
FOR BRINGING THIS LEGISLATION

00:55:21.851 --> 00:55:23.253
BECAUSE OF FORCED ARBITRATION IS

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.454
AN AREA THAT AFFECTS SO MANY

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.489
WORKERS ACROSS --

00:55:26.556 --> 00:55:27.123
SO MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES --

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.260
IT BACK ARBITRATION WAS ONLY IN

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:32.862
ABOUT 16% OF WORKPLACES --

00:55:32.929 --> 00:55:33.897
BUT TODAY WE KNOW THE FORCE

00:55:33.963 --> 00:55:36.332
ARBITRATION COVERS ABOUT 68% OF

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:37.901
CALIFORNIA WORKERS --

00:55:37.967 --> 00:55:39.469
MAY AND WE KNOW THE REASON WHY

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:40.937
IS BECAUSE THEY EMPLOYERS DO

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.038
BETTER IN THIS FORUM WE KNOW

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.373
THAT FEWER WORKERS TAKE CLAIMS

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.008
ARBITRATION WE KNOW THAT THE FEW

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:47.010
WORKERS WHO DO TAKE THOSE CLAIMS.

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.044
TO ARBITRATION ARE LESS LIKELY

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:49.112
TO WIN WE KNOW THAT THE FEW

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.413
WORKERS WHO DO WIN WIN

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.848
SUBSTANTIALLY LAST LESS IN

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:52.849
DAMAGES --

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.517
SO THE SYSTEMS CLEARLY BROKEN

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:55.518
AND WILD --

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:56.686
STATES ARE LIMITED IN WHAT THEY

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.221
CAN DO IN THIS SPACE WE BELIEVE

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:59.656
THAT WE'VE CRAFTED A NEARLY

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:00.857
TAYLOR BILL THAT AVOIDS ANY

00:56:00.924 --> 00:56:02.659
FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES --

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:03.927
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SPACE WHERE

00:56:03.993 --> 00:56:05.095
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD WE

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:06.162
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

00:56:06.229 --> 00:56:07.363
COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY SORT

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.898
OF WALKING BACK FROM THIS SORT

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.266
OF FORCED ARBITRATION POLICY

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:13.470
AMBLIN THINGS DIFFERENT

00:56:13.536 --> 00:56:13.770
PROPOSALS --

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.905
AND AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT IF

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:16.840
YOU CONTINUE WITH SYSTEM WHERE

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.241
EMPLOYERS CAN PAY A PRIVATE

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.876
PARTY TO INTERPRET THE LAW IN A

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.244
WAY THAT THE BENEFITS THEM.

00:56:21.311 --> 00:56:22.712
AND THEM FORCE WORKERS TO BE

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.414
STUCK WITH THAT RULING --

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:26.149
PROHIBIT THEM FROM GOING FROM

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.283
GETTING AN APPEAL EVEN IF THE

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.119
RULING IS WRONG AND INTO THE

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:29.953
WORKER THEY CAN'T TALK TO

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:31.254
ANYBODY ABOUT IT THAT THEY

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:32.422
SYSTEMS COULD BE BROKE IT MAKES

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:33.523
A LOS WE PASS YOUR MEANINGLESS

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.524
IT MAKES ALL THE WORK

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:35.391
PROTECTIONS OF RIGHTS

00:56:35.458 --> 00:56:36.226
PROTECTIONS.

THE PASS IF YOU HEARD THAT WE

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:38.795

IF THOSE RIGHTS CAN BE A FORCE

00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:43.199

FIFTY ONE TODAY CLOSE 270% OF

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:55.612
CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE IS BOUND

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:57.547
BY THESE AGREEMENTS.

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.215
NATIONWIDE IT'S MORE THAN SIXTY

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:00.316
MILLION WORKERS.

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.452
ARBITRATIONS CAN BE FAIR LIKE

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:03.620
MENTIONED BEFORE WHEN IT'S

00:57:03.686 --> 00:57:05.021
BETWEEN PEOPLE WITH EQUAL --

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.123
BARGAINING POWER BUT THE REALITY

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.092
IS THAT IF A WAS SINGLE WORKERS

00:57:09.159 --> 00:57:10.059
FORCED AGAINST THEIR EMPLOYER

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:12.028
INTO ARBITRATION THE REAL RESULT

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.196
IS CLAIM SUPPRESSION IN MANY

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:14.430
INSTANCES.

00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:15.698
ESPECIALLY AMONG LOW WAGE WORK

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.400
OF LOW WAGE WORKERS.

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:18.835
AND WE ALL KNOW THAT ONE THIRD

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:21.004
OF OUR NATION --

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:22.305
IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY AND

00:57:22.372 --> 00:57:24.574
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND SO FOR

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:28.011
BRING THEIR CLAIMS --

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:30.280
IT'S ALSO UNFAIR AND ONE SIDED

00:57:30.346 --> 00:57:31.781
WHILE THE ARBITRATION CLAUSES

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:33.049
TAKE AWAY THE CONSUMER AND

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:35.051
EMPLOYERS RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:35.685
CLAIMS HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR

00:57:35.752 --> 00:57:36.586
JURY --

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:37.520
THAT'S NOT THE SAME FOR THE

00:57:37.587 --> 00:57:39.489
CORPORATION THE CORPORATION IS

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.124
STILL OUT TO SUE IN COURT.

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:43.259

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:55.138
DISABILITY.

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:56.306
THE RESULT OF DOING NOTHING IS

00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:58.641
THAT THIS PUBLIC SYSTEM OF

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.977
PUBLIC JUSTICE IS RESULTING IN

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:06.082

ITS PREEMPTION --

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.109

01:00:52.048 --> 01:00:54.283
ISSUE WITH REGARDS THE APPLE I

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.752
FEEL WAS CLEARED UP IN THE

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:57.053
KINDRED NURSING CASE BY JUSTICE

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.421
KAGAN WHEN SHE SAID.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:00:59.722
THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:00.790
NOT ONLY APPLIES TO THE

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.158
INTERPRETATION OF A CONTRACT

01:01:02.225 --> 01:01:04.093
ONCE FORMED BUT ALSO APPLIES TO

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:05.395
FORMATION OF CONTRACT AND IF YOU

01:01:05.461 --> 01:01:07.397
PUT A SET A SPECIAL RESTRICTION.

01:01:07.463 --> 01:01:08.164

ARBITRATION A CONTRACT THAT IS

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.601
NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL CONTRACTS

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:12.802
THEN IT VIOLATES THE FEDERAL

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:13.803
ARBITRATION ACT AND IT IS

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.670
PREEMPTED.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.172
IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY IN --

01:01:16.239 --> 01:01:17.507
THE SECURELY CASE WHITE MEMORIAL

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:20.276

WAS STRUCK DOWN AS PRINTED IN

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:24.080
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AS

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.248
WELL BECAUSE IT ALSO PUT A

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:27.250
SPONSOR A SPECIAL RESTRICTION.

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:28.084
ON THE FORMATION OF AN

01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:29.285
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN A

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:31.521
CONSUMER CONTRACT JUST LIKE AB

01:01:31.587 --> 01:01:32.555
FIFTY ONE IT SAID.

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:33.890
THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE AN

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:34.991
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT'S

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:36.092
REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:37.760
SIGNING A CONSUMER CONTRACT THE

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:39.028
COURT THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF

01:01:39.095 --> 01:01:40.129
APPEALS SAID THAT'S PRINTED IN

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.330
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:42.131
BECAUSE IT PUTS A SPECIAL

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.032
RESTRICTION.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:43.966
ON THE FORMATION OF AN

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.668
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT THAT IS

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:46.569
NOT APPLICABLE TO ALL THE

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:47.870
CONTRACTS SEEM ISSUE APPLIES

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.238
HERE WITH REGARDS TO A. B. FIFTY

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.440
ONE IT BASICALLY SAYS YOU CANNOT

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.874
HAVE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:53.009
THAT'S MADE AS A CONDITION OF

01:01:53.076 --> 01:01:54.510
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT SO WE FEEL

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:55.778
LIKE IT'S LIKELY TO BE PRINTED

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:57.113
AND THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.281
AND WE BELIEVE IT'S THE SAME

01:01:58.347 --> 01:01:59.348
REASON WHY GOVERNR BROWN SAID

01:01:59.415 --> 01:01:59.982
LAST YEAR.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:01.784
THAT THIS BILL PLAINLY VIOLATES

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.286
FEDERAL LAW I DID IT REFERENCE

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:05.154
THE AMENDMENT IN THE ANALYSIS TO

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:06.789
SAY THAT NOTHING BASICALLY IS

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.591
MEANT -- TO

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:09.826
RENDER AN AGREEMENT OTHERWISE

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.694
UNENFORCEABLE UNDER THE FAA IT

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:12.695
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT SAVES

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.830
IT FROM THE PREEMPTION OF THE

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.731
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT YES ONCE

01:02:15.798 --> 01:02:17.200
AN AGREEMENT AS FOR FORMED.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:21.003
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WILL

01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.638
APPLY BUT IT ALSO A CONTRACTS IS

01:02:22.705 --> 01:02:25.741
NOT NEW ARENA IN THE ARMY THERE

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:27.143
IS CASE WITH REGARDS TO THIS --

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.811
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IT WAS

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:29.912
IN AN HUSING CONTRACT IN THE

01:02:29.979 --> 01:02:30.980
COURT DIDN'T STRIKE DOWN THE

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:32.215
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON THAT

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:33.616
BASIS IT JUST SAID IF YOU'RE

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:34.150
GOING TO HAVE ANY HUSING

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:35.184
CONTRACT.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.219
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.020
SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS INCLUDED IN

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:38.654
THAT PROCEDURAL SO IT'S

01:02:38.721 --> 01:02:40.456
CONSTABLE --

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:41.991
I ALSO HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.192
DEBATE LONG ENOUGH TO REALIZE

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.760
THAT MY AB PERSPECTIVE ON THE

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.129
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT MAY NOT

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:46.896
BE THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.231
COMMITTEE --

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.132
AND THAT THIS BILL MAY MAKE IT

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:50.366
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE LIKE IT

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:51.701
DID LAST YEAR AND MAYBE IT IS

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:52.835
ULTIMATELY SIGNED BY GOVERNOR

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.036
NEWSOME WE'RE NOT SURE

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:54.871
NECESSARILY OBVIOUSLY ABOUT THAT

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:55.805
WILL GO.

01:02:55.872 --> 01:02:56.873
BUT IF IT IS I'M ALSO QUITE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.808
CONFIDENT THAT JUST LIKE AB

01:02:58.875 --> 01:02:59.442
TWENTY SIX SEVENTEEN IT WILL BE

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:00.643
IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED AND

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:01.878
BECAUSE OF HOW BROAD THIS BILL

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.112
IS WITH RESPECT TO IT SPLIT

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.248

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:07.617
FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:08.918
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:10.620
IMMEDIATELY CHALLENGED ON THE

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:11.988
BASIS OF FEDERAL PREEMPTION.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.656
IF THAT'S THE CASE --

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:14.657
I FULLY BELIEVE THAT THE INTENT

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:15.791
OF THE AUTHOR IS TO PROTECT

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:16.993
EMPLOYEES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:18.060
THAT PROVIDES ANY ADDITIONAL

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.762
PROTECTION TO EMPLOYEES IT'S

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:20.630
GOING TO ADD ANOTHER LAYER OF

LITIGATION IT'S GOING.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.066
TO COST AND IT'S GOING TO ADD

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.301
DELAY TO THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION

01:03:25.368 --> 01:03:26.802
OF THE UNDERLYING DISPUTE THAT

A RUNAWAY VERDICT THAT WOULD

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.505
ACOSTA TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:11.507

LAWYER WHO WILL BRING.

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.024
A LAWSUIT AGAINST A AN EMPLOYER

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.525
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.294
ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENTLY

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.129
HIGH. TO MAKE IT WORTH IT TO

PROPONENTS TRIED TO MAKE IT

01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:45.041
SOUND LIKE THAT WAS SOMETHING

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.609
NEFARIOUS THAT'S ACTUALLY A

01:05:46.676 --> 01:05:48.678
WORKER BENEFIT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:54.583

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.918

JUSTICE WHEN THE DAY IS OR OVER.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.100
EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION NEEDS TO

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:12.501
BE PRESERVED IMPROVE NOT

CASES WERE SPARE TIME AND

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:33.889
EXPENSE THEY'RE ONLY PRACTICAL

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.458

IF THERE WERE NOT ABLE FAN OF IT

01:07:47.263 --> 01:07:51.000
IF WE'RE NOT REQUIRED TO SIGN IN

OUR GROUP TO ARBITRATION

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.302
AGREEMENT --

01:07:53.369 --> 01:07:53.936
BUT I WHICH I SHOULD BE OFF THE

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.438
TABLE.

01:07:55.504 --> 01:07:56.972
IT WAS JUST.

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.874
SO I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR.

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:00.309
YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY IN THIS

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.445
BILL HAVE HAVE POINTED OUT SOME

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:03.412
OF THE SHORTCOMINGS OF

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:04.747
ARBITRATION I COME FROM THE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:06.715
LABOR MOVEMENT WE WE BELIEVE IN

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:08.818
BINDING ARBITRATION WHEN PARTY'S

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:11.220
VOLUNTARILY ENTER INTO IT AND

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.755
THERE IS SOME EQUITY IN POWER --

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.523
THAT'S MISSING HERE AND SO IN WE

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:15.791
THINK EVEN WITH THE NATIONAL

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.726
ARBITRATION ACT WHAT'S MISSING

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.128
IS THE COERCION PIECE.

01:08:19.195 --> 01:08:20.830
CONSENT TO GO INTERPRETATION

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:22.364
SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON THE TABLE IN

01:08:22.431 --> 01:08:23.866
EVEN AND DISPUTES IT SHOULD BE

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:25.401
SOMETHING THAT A WORKER CAN

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:27.069
ENTER INTO IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.337
SO IF THEY HAVE AN EMPLOYER WHO

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.672
ACTUALLY WILL.

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:30.940
ARBITRATE SOMETHING A TIMELY

01:08:31.006 --> 01:08:31.941
MATTER WERE SEEN THAT THAT'S NOT

01:08:32.007 --> 01:08:33.742
ALWAYS THE CASE --

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.477
YOU KNOW THAT THE ARBITRATORS

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:36.645
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PAID FOR

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:37.580
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONDITIONS

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:38.547
THAT I THINK --

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:40.316
ARE NECESSARY FOR THAT TO BE A A

01:08:40.382 --> 01:08:42.051
GOOD CHOICE FOR A WORKER THE

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.586
TRUTH IS RIGHT NOW THAT THERE IS

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:44.720
NO CHOICE.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.856
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO ADD

01:08:46.922 --> 01:08:48.824
WE WANT TO ADD SOME PRETTY

01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:50.359
CHOICE FOR THE EMPLOYER WHICH

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.694
ALREADY EXIST AND WILL CONTINUE

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.128
TO EXIST BUT THAT THERE'S A

01:08:53.195 --> 01:08:54.263
CHOICE AS WELL FOR THE WORKER

01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.764
AND THAT'S WHETHER OR NOT THERE

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.032
THEIR COURSE TO SIGN IT AS A

01:08:57.099 --> 01:08:58.434
CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT.

01:08:58.501 --> 01:08:59.935
AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD MY

01:09:00.002 --> 01:09:01.403
POINT IS WELL TAKEN BECAUSE NOT

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.639
ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION AS THE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:07.109
AS THE OPTIONS THE CHOICE AND I

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:07.443
DO THINK THAT.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.611
IN ALSO --

01:09:08.677 --> 01:09:10.846
BUT SOMEONE THAT BELIEVES THAT

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:12.748
THE ARBITRATION ABSOLUTE PLAYS

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:13.349
WELL AS A REASON WHY IT DOES

01:09:13.415 --> 01:09:14.283
EXIST.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.384
IT IN OUR SYSTEM IN AN

01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.520
OFTENTIMES RESOLVES ISSUES IN A

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:18.821
MORE EFFICIENT CLASS C..

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:20.322
UP MORE OR A COST EFFECTIVE

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:21.423
MANNER.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:24.326
BUT TO SAY IT SHOULD BE THE IT

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:25.661
IS THE ONLY WAY OR SHOULD OR

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.596
MUST BE THE ONLY WAY AS A

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:28.230
CONDITION OF EMPLOYMENT I THINK

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:29.131
THAT.

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.499
CITING AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:32.201
IT CERTAINLY COULD BE A VALID

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:33.802
AND REASONABLE AND SENSIBLE

01:09:33.869 --> 01:09:35.037
CHOICE WAS GONNA BE A CHOICE I

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:35.905
THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.473
COMES DOWN TO IS THE CHOICE THAT.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.108
MAKES SENSE IN ORDER TO RESOLVE

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:41.310
DISPUTES BUT MAKING SURE THAT

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.145
WORKERS BUT I'M PUT IN A

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:44.647
POSITION --

01:09:44.713 --> 01:09:46.215
NUMBER DAY ONE OR FOR THE FOR

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:48.017
THE FOUR DAY ONE OF EMPLOYMENT.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:48.951
THAT THEY'RE OUT THERE MAKING A

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.753
CHOICE ON SOMETHING WHEN IT'S

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:51.954
REALLY NOT A CHOICE BECAUSE THEY

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.622
CAN SAY NO I WON'T SIGN IT AND

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:54.957
THEN THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.192
AND SO THAT'S A REALLY FALSE

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.192
CHOICE I THINK HAVING THE

01:09:57.259 --> 01:10:03.132
OPPORTUNITY. TO RESOLVE ISSUES

01:10:03.198 --> 01:10:05.868
IN THE WAY THAT MAKE.

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.070
RESOLVING A RESOLVING ISSUES

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:09.972
RESOLVING CONFLICT IN A WAY THAT

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.240
MAKES SENSE AND HAVING ALL

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.875
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE.

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.510
ACTUALLY --

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:16.445
THIS THIS BILL IS DOES THAT

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:17.980
BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ALL OPTIONS ON

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:20.616
THE TABLE NOT JUST ONE OPTION --

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.051
THAT THE EMPLOYER CHOOSES AND

01:10:22.117 --> 01:10:23.586
THEN SO I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:25.521
REASONABLE AND AND THERE'S NO

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.956
DOUBT LOOK ON ON ON BIG ISSUES

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.157
LIKE THIS CERTAINLY.

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.792
THE MAYBE LITIGATION AND AND ALL

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.827
THAT THE COURTS DECIDE --

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.862
BUT I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE THAT --

01:10:33.929 --> 01:10:35.564
THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED AT THAT

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.865
THAT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME BY

01:10:36.932 --> 01:10:41.337
ANALOGY AT SOME POINT BECAUSE

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:41.937
THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS BACK

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.272
AND FORTH.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:44.607
BUT THAT THAT'S GOING TO

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:45.908
CONTINUE TO A CAR UNTIL THERE'S

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:46.809
SOME CERTAINTY AND I THINK THAT

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.611
AT SOME POINT SOME ISSUES AS ARE

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:51.013
SOME CERTAINTY AT THIS IS ONE OF

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.081
THEM SOME OF THE BILL.

01:10:52.147 --> 01:10:53.449
THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:53.983
THERE SECONDS.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:56.418
AND A SECOND THANK YOU.

01:10:56.485 --> 01:11:02.291
OTHER MEMBERS TOGETHER --

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:03.826
YEAH WE'LL JUST. ONE OF THE

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.227
THINGS HERE THAT I THINK IS AN

01:11:05.294 --> 01:11:06.996
ISSUE IS THAT ACTUALLY IT HAS

01:11:07.062 --> 01:11:07.863
BEEN DECIDED.

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.365
THE COURTS HAVE DECIDED THESE

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:11.934
CASES TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.669
ONE IS PREEMPTED BY --

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.804
THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.107
THEN ALSO THAT THESE AREN'T.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.708
CONSIDERED CAUGHT CONTRACTS OF

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.043
ADHESION --

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.578
SO THERE HAS BEEN RULINGS ON

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:24.113
THIS WHERE COURTS HAVE

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:24.747
CONSIDERED A LOT OF THE THINGS

01:11:24.813 --> 01:11:25.748
THAT.

01:11:25.814 --> 01:11:27.116
ARE BEING BROUGHT UP AND HAVE

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.518
DECIDED DIFFERENTLY --

01:11:29.585 --> 01:11:30.919
WHICH IS I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU KNOW

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.454
THE WHY THIS BILLS PAIN BROUGHT

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.889
RIGHT TO TRY AND CODIFY

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.724
SOMETHING IN SORT OF FORCE.

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:38.227
THE ISSUE THAT WAY --

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:39.395
BUT NONE THE LESS I THINK YOU

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:41.130
KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CONTAINER RIGHT

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.264
INTO.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.799
FEDERAL PREEMPTION ISSUES YOU

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.668
KNOW WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK WAS

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:48.637
POINTED OUT AS AS ONE OF THE

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:49.471
YEAH LOOK WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:51.874
HAD LAWS OVERTURNED BECAUSE OF

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:53.976
IT YOU KNOW WHY WOULD THIS.

01:11:54.043 --> 01:11:56.311
BE ANY DIFFERENT --

01:11:56.378 --> 01:11:56.945
THE OTHER THING THE OTHER ASPECT

01:11:57.012 --> 01:12:01.817
ON IF THERE WAS A WAGE AN HOUR

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:05.254
VIOLATION RAY --

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.823
OR IF THERE WAS A VIOLATION OF

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:09.792
SAY OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.460
HAZARD --

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.028
EMPLOYEES WOULD STILL HAVE THE

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:15.964
BENEFIT OF GOING TO GOING TO THE

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:18.100
STATE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.735
FOR PENALTIES AND FINES IS NOT

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.136
CORRECT NO THAT'S NOT TRUE IN

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:21.870
FACT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:23.939
WON'T TAKE AT THE CLAIMS IF

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.708
THERE IS AN ARBITRATION

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.177
AGREEMENT.

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:29.912
SO THEY WOULD NOT IT IS SO UNDER

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.213
THESE UNDER THESE --

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.848
ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THEY

01:12:32.915 --> 01:12:34.283
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO BEFORE

01:12:34.349 --> 01:12:36.218
LABOR COMMISSIONER'S SALE OR GO

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.886
THROUGH THE THE YOU KNOW CAL

01:12:37.953 --> 01:12:39.354
OSHA --

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:41.390
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW PROCESS IS

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:42.224
THAT YOUR AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.659
COLD CALLOUS I KNOW THEY CAN'T

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:44.526
GO TO THE LABOR --

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:47.963
COMMISSIONER AND AS I IN ALL OF

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.132
MY BILLS I I I PROBABLY SOUND A

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:50.999
LITTLE SCHIZOPHRENIC RIGHT

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.801
BECAUSE I OF BILLS THAT SAY I

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:54.303
DON'T LIKE FEE HOW WE SHOULD BE

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:55.437
ABLE TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:55.838
WHILE.

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:58.040
MEN LIKE FIA I'D LIKE THE LAID I

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.809
LIKE THE LABOR CODE WE ARE LIKE

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:01.944
ARE ONES THAT YOU LIKE BETTER

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:02.511
THAN BUT THE POINT WELL THE

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:03.078
POINT IS IT DEPENDS ON THE

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.346
SITUATION AND THAT IS A PERFECT

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.380
EXAMPLE THE FACT THAT.

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.349
YOU KNOW IF I'M BEING CHEATED

01:13:07.416 --> 01:13:08.917
OUT OF WAGE IN OUR ISSUES AND I

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.352
GO REPORT TO THE LABOR

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.286
COMMISSIONER THEY'RE GOING TO

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.855
SEND ME BACK TO MY EMPLOYER AND

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:17.159
I HAVE TO WAIT ON HIM OR HER. TO

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.428
TO HIRE AN ARBITRATOR TO GO I

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.330
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO WHAT'S

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.698
THE WHAT'S.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:24.666
WHAT WHAT'S THE THE PRODUCT

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.502
THERE'S ALSO NO APPEALS PROCESS

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:27.970
WITH AN ARBITRATION SO IF YOU GO

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:29.271
THROUGH ARBITRATION VOLUNTARILY

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.006
THAT'S ONE THING BUT EVEN IF THE

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.374
ARBITRATOR GETS THE WALL WRONG

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:33.742
BLATANTLY WRONG?

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.544
THERE'S NO SENSE THERE'S NO WAY

01:13:35.611 --> 01:13:37.079
TO FIX THAT --

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:38.413
THERE'S NO.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.648
KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS COULD BE

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.183
GOING IF IF YOU'RE CHEATING ME

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.417
OUT OF WAGES AND WORKING

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.019
CONDITIONS IF YOU'RE CHEATING ME

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.220
OUT OF A SAFE WORKING

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:45.821
ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE PROBABLY

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:46.922
DOING A TO A LOT OF OTHER

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:48.257
EMPLOYEES AS WELL.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.792
THERE'S NO WAY TO ADDRESS EIGHT

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.093
A FIX IN A BROADER WAY THROUGH

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.495
ARBITRATION SO THAT'S WHY I

01:13:53.562 --> 01:13:54.229
THINK -- YOU

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.697
KNOW AND AN EMPLOYEE SHOULD

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.733
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENTER

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.601
INTO IT WITHOUT COERCION AND I

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.403
THINK THAT YOU KNOW LOOK I KNOW

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:02.671
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BILLS WE

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.473
WE ARE A LOT OF COURT CASES WE

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.240
READ THEM ALL.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.408
THIS WE THINK IS NARROWLY

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.110
TAILORED TO ADDRESS THE THINGS

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:10.145
THT THE COURT HAS SAID AND AND

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:10.779
YOU KNOW.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:12.514
I I I DON'T HAVE A MAGIC EIGHT

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:14.082
BALL I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.784
COURT IS GOING TO SAY BUT WE

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:16.585
KNOW THAT WE TOOK ALL THESE

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:17.953
CASES AND THINGS THAT HAD BEEN

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:18.987
REJECTED.

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:20.455
AND WROTE A BILL --

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:21.690
THAT THAT WE THOUGHT ALLOWED A

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.292
NARROW PATH TO SAY HEY LET'S

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:24.560
JUST MAKE SURE WORKERS

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:25.861
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE WHAT

01:14:25.928 --> 01:14:27.396
THEY'RE SIGNING ON TO AND

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:28.030
THEY'RE WILLING TO SIGN ON TO

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:28.730
THAT.

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.699
SO IT'S A VALID I THINK APPROACH

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:31.967
BUT YEAH IT TAKES AWAY NOT JUST

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:36.972
COURT BUT WHAT I FIND TO BE --

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:40.909
MY PREFERRED AT COMMISSIONER.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.144
RIGHT NOW I MEAN AND I THINK

01:14:42.211 --> 01:14:43.979
THAT GOES TO SOME OF THIS TOO IS

01:14:44.046 --> 01:14:45.747
I THINK A LOT OF EMPLOYERS FEEL

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:47.015
LIKE WHEN THEY GO.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:47.683
YOU KNOW TO THE LABOR

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:48.951
COMMISSIONER FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.719
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:51.653
WHO'S.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.355
WHO'S EMPLOYED BY AND PAID BY

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:56.091
THE SAME VERY SAME AGENCY --

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.559
THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING NAY IT

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.561
NECESSARILY A FAIR FORM THIS

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.996
THEIR ISER RIGHT.

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:02.464
YOU KNOW AND ALL JUDGES ARE PAID

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:04.333
I'M I'M SORRY MR GALLAGHER BUT

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:07.002
LIKE WHO PAYS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:08.937
LAW JUDGES IT'S THIS WAY.

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:09.938
A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC I MEAN

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:10.939
I'M NOT SAYING I'M SAYING LIKE

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.875
SO PEOPLE HAVE THEIR OF JUDGES

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:13.442
WERE.

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.177
THEIR PREFERRED FORUMS I'M NOT

01:15:15.244 --> 01:15:16.178
SAYING ALL JUDGE I'M SAYING THE

01:15:16.245 --> 01:15:18.146
VERY SAME AGENCY THAT IS

01:15:18.213 --> 01:15:19.748
RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCEMENT IS

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.516
ALSO EMPLOYING THE JUDGE SO

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.484
THERE IS.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.419
OFTEN CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:27.189
NEUTRALITY IN AN EIGHT AND

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.724
SECOND WERE A LITTLE OFF.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:29.458
THE BILL --

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:30.993
MIGHT THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:34.062
TOPIC BUT SO WE CAN DEBATE THE

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:39.201
PRODUCTIVITY OF THE LABOR

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:42.104
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AND THESE

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:43.739
AGREEMENTS.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:46.141
CLUED AN EMPLOYEE FROM GOING TO

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.876
THE LABOR COMMISSIONER.

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:50.078
SO THE OR OR CAL OSHA BECAUSE

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.313
I'M NOT SURE THAT I DON'T KNOW

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.547
ABOUT THE SHOT THAT THAT THAT

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:53.348
THE QUESTION IS.

01:15:53.415 --> 01:15:54.850
OF A WORKER WHO WAS NOT PAID

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.485
WAGES ARE TREATED UNFAIRLY WOULD

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:57.552
STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:58.287
IT WOULD JUST BE THROUGH

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.721
ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:03.025
BRINGING A LAWSUIT OR BRINGING A

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:05.127
CLAIM TO THE BUT LABOR.

01:16:05.193 --> 01:16:06.828
COMMISSIONER AND IF SO FOR TEN

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:07.429
THIRTY ONE OUT JENNIFER IF IF

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:08.130
I'D JUST AT THE LABOR

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:08.697
COMMISSIONER PIECES ACTUALLY

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:09.665
ACCURATE THERE WAS A CALIFORNIA

01:16:09.731 --> 01:16:10.966
SUPREME COURT CASE THE SONIC

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.634
CALABASAS CASE SAYING THAT AN

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.436
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:14.736
PREVENT --

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.371
IT AS A GOING TO THE LABOR

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.572
COMMISSIONER HEARING TO HAVE AN

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.507
ADMINISTRATOR JUDICATA

01:16:18.573 --> 01:16:20.008
ADMINISTRATIVE ADJUDICATION

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.076
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:22.477
EMPLOYER COMMUNITY WOULD BE FINE

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:23.679
ST YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THAT

01:16:23.745 --> 01:16:24.913
GREAT LET THEM GO TO THE LABOR

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.214
COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS JUST

01:16:26.281 --> 01:16:27.549
IT'S AGAIN PREEMPTED RATE YOU

01:16:27.616 --> 01:16:28.183
CAN'T.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.718
HAVE THE SPECIAL RESTRICTION AND

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:30.953
IDENTIFY CLAIMS THAT CAN GO TO

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.120
ARBITRATION AND ONES THAT CAN'T

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.555
BY STATE STATUTE BECAUSE THAT'S

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:34.790
INTERFERING WITH ARBITRATION SO

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.491
IT IS IT AN AMENDMENT THAT WE

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:37.859
WOULD LOVE TO OFFER UP AND SAY

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.094
HEY WE BECAUSE WE WE THINK THE

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:40.262
LABOR COMMISSIONER I HEARING

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:40.796
PROCESS.

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:42.664
VERY EFFICIENT PROCESS --

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.499
AND IT IS ONE THAT GETS THE

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:45.600
RESOLUTION RESOLVED QUICKLY

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.136
HOWEVER WE WOULD BE DISINGENUOUS

01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:49.237
AND OFFERING UP SOMETHING LIKE

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:50.105
THAT IN A MINUTE BECAUSE IT

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:51.573
WOULD BE PRINTED UNDER FEDERAL

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.908
ARBITRATION ACT AS DECIDED BY

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.343
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN

01:16:54.409 --> 01:16:55.410
THE SAUNA CALABASAS CASE.

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:58.347
OCEANS DIFFERENT BECAUSE OSHA IS

01:16:58.413 --> 01:16:58.880
AN AGENCY ENFORCEMENT AND

01:16:58.947 --> 01:16:59.348
THERE'S NO REAL --

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.683
ABILITY FOR A PRIVATE EMPLOYER

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.385
TO BUYING ARE BOUND.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:07.055
DID I SAY THAT RIGHT PROPER

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:07.422
ENGLISH BIND --

01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:10.258
I CAN'T DO THAT THE COURTS HAVE

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.860
ALREADY HELD THAT THAT IS NOT --

01:17:11.927 --> 01:17:13.996
ALLOWED SO YOU CAN'T HAVE A

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:15.697
MANDATORY ARBITRATION FOR OSHA

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:17.766
AGREEMENTS BUT THERE IS FOR

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:19.735
LABOR COMMISSION AGREEMENTS.

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.136
AND THEN I MEAN DO YOU BELIEVE

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.772
THAT ARBITRATORS AREN'T NEUTRAL.

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:26.575
ARE YOU ASKING ME THEM.

01:17:26.641 --> 01:17:28.143
AN ARBITRATOR IS PAID FOR BY THE

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:30.645
EMPLOYER --

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:33.215
I I THINK THAT TIPS IN FAVOR OF

01:17:33.281 --> 01:17:34.449
ONE OVER THE OTHER I'M AND I

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.585
THINK ARBITRATORS LIKE JUDGES

01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:38.053
CAN GET THINGS WRONG AND THAT

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.054
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN APPEAL

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.155
PROCESS BUT THERE'S NO APPEAL

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:41.490
PROCESS THERE IS A NOTATION BUT

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:42.724
THAT ACTUALLY IS IT CORRECT

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:44.026
RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN.

01:17:44.092 --> 01:17:46.495
TAKE AN ARBITRATION AWARD BUT

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.130
AND AND PETITION --

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.765
TO THE SUPERIOR COURT NOW THAT

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.333
OVER TURNED OUT IF IF IF THAT

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.802
SUCH A LAW WAS IF THE LAW WAS

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:55.303
IMPROPERLY APPLIED THAT'S NOT

01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:56.972
TRUE I BELIEVE THAT IS THE CARE

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:58.673
IS NO APPEAL PROCESS AND USE SO

01:17:58.740 --> 01:17:59.307
IF IF YOU IF.

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:00.809
THEY'RE CERTAIN PROCEDURAL

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:01.977
THINGS THAT IF THEY DON'T TO

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:02.944
ARBITRATION ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.746
APPEAL BUT FOR EXAMPLE BASIC

01:18:04.813 --> 01:18:05.847
RULES OF EVIDENCE OF CERTAIN

01:18:05.914 --> 01:18:08.850
THINGS THE ARBITER IT IS FREE.

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.619
TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE WITH IN MANY

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:12.087
CASES THIS ACCRUES TO THE BENTON

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.456
BENEFITS OF PLAINTIFFS BECAUSE

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.825
WHERE BLACK LETTER LAW MIGHT.

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:19.327
WARRANT A SUMMARY JUDGMENT

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:20.762
MOTION RIGHT DISCOVERY ANY OTHER.

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:22.130
STATE DIFFERENT YEAH BUT GIVEN

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:22.898
THE MERITS I WANT TO GIVE SOME

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:23.999
TO THIS PLAINTIFF ANYWAY BUT

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:26.068
APPLICATION OF THE LAW IF IT WAS

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:27.102
IF IF.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:29.104
THE LAW WAS INCORRECTLY APPLIED

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.505
TO THE FACTS THERE IS THE

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:32.407
ABILITY TO PETITIONS TO SUPERIOR

01:18:32.474 --> 01:18:34.076
COURT TO OVERTURN I WOULD LET

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.744
KNOW THAT THAT IS THAT NOT

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:36.511
INCORRECT.

01:18:36.578 --> 01:18:39.181
STATEMENT LAW THAT IS AN

01:18:39.247 --> 01:18:46.521
INCORRECT STATEMENT HOW OLD.

01:18:46.588 --> 01:18:47.422
WE WOULD LIKE.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:48.690
THOSE CASES I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:49.157
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT MY

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.258
UNDERSTANDING A LOT WELL IF I

01:18:50.325 --> 01:18:51.726
HAD THE STATUE IN FRONT OF ME I

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:52.360
WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU BUT YET

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:52.561
YEAH.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:53.895
THERE ARE LIMITED GROUNDS FOR AN

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:54.296
APPEAL --

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:55.097
IT'S IN THAT COULD SILVER

01:18:55.163 --> 01:18:55.931
PROCEDURE UPON THE GROUNDS OF

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:56.465
WHICH YOU CAN VACATE AN

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:57.566
ARBITRATION AWARDS THERE ARE

01:18:57.632 --> 01:18:58.467
LIMITED GROUNDS THERE'S A COURT

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.434
CASE CALL PEARSON DENTAL AND

01:18:59.501 --> 01:19:00.502
WHICH THEY SAID IF THE JUDGE HAS

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:01.169
ARE EXCUSE ME THE ARBITRATOR HAS

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:01.803
APPLIED THE LAW IN A WAY WHICH

01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:04.206
DENIES AT INDIVIDUAL.

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:04.773
THEIR SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS WAS

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.975
DEALING WITH THE FOR ALL THAT TO

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:08.477
SUPERIOR COURT IT'S PAST THERE

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.544
HAS TO BE SOME BASIS TO APPEAL

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:10.946
AN ARBITRATION AWARD OTHERWISE

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:11.646
WE WOULDN'T HAVE ALL THIS

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:12.881
JURISPRUDENCE OUT THERE WITH

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:13.715
REGARD STARBIRD REACHING

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:14.249
AGREEMENTS.

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:15.484
AND ARBITRATION WORDS THAT HAVE

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:16.751
BEEN ISSUED SO THERE ARE LIMITED

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.487
GROUNDS IT'S NOT AS BROAD AS A

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.955
CIVIL COURT CASE BUT THERE ARE

01:19:20.021 --> 01:19:21.223
GRANTS.

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:21.823
TO SO ONCE AGAIN THERE IS THE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:24.326
LAW AND YES YOU CAN APPEAL --

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:25.494
BUT YOU KNOW I MEAN I LOVE THE

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.962
STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE WITHOUT

01:19:27.028 --> 01:19:28.997
ANY BACKUP OR ANY SUPPORT FOR

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:30.532
THEM BUT CLEARLY THERE IS THE

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:31.800
ABILITY TO APPEAL.

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:34.669
AS I JUST STATED PREVIOUSLY WELL

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:36.805
EXCEPT THAT THAT WAS INCORRECT

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:39.174
STATEMENT BECAUSE BE ABLE TO

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.842
APPEAL.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:42.077
A WHAT A ARBITRATOR GETS LAW

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:43.345
WRONG THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.347
CIRCUMSTANCES TO APPEAL.

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:45.981
JUST AN INCORRECT APPLICATION A

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:47.349
LAW.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:48.517
IS IT SO DID YOU JUST SAY THERE

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:49.885
ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.620
APPEAL VERY LIMITED THAT ARE

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.388
MOSTLY AROUND DAY THANK YOU

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:55.157
MISTER SANDERS OF THAT OF THE

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.558
ARBITRATION BUT THE BROAD

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:58.160
STATEMENT THAT YOU MAKE THAT.

01:19:58.226 --> 01:20:00.595
IF A ARBITRATOR GETS THE LAW

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.397
WRONG THAT IS APPEALABLE TO THE

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:04.432
COURT IS NOT CORRECT.

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:05.834
THIS PETRIE-NORRIS JUST SO I CAN

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:07.102
CAN CLARIFY SO.

01:20:07.169 --> 01:20:08.537
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE POINT IS

01:20:08.603 --> 01:20:10.172
THIS LEGISLATION FROM THE AUTHOR

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.740
IS NOT TO CHALLENGE WHETHER

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:13.375
ARBITRATION IS IN FACT A FAIR

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:14.309
EFFICIENT AND JUST MEANS OF

01:20:14.376 --> 01:20:17.145
RESOLVING DISPUTES IT'S SIMPLY.

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:22.317
TO STATE THAT THAT HAS TO BE A A

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.285
CONSENSUAL ARBITRATION RATHER

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:25.287
THAN.

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:26.821
MANDATORY CORRECT THE RIGHT NOT

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.056
TO HAVE WHEN I ENTERED EIGHTY

01:20:28.123 --> 01:20:28.924
MONETARILY WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.392
GET BEATING THE MERITS OR

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:32.594
ARBITRATION.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.363
IN THIS BOOK CORRECT THAT'S

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.199
THAT'S CORRECT ABSOLUTELY.

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:38.166
OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:38.733
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.367
FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:40.268
CLEARLY SOME FLAWS IN.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.037
THE WAY THAT THE FEDERAL

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:43.405
ARBITRATION AGREEMENT OR FEDERAL

01:20:43.471 --> 01:20:45.941
CHASE ACT IS WRITTEN AND IT ENDS

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:47.742
UP WITH VERY UNFAIR APPLICATION

01:20:47.809 --> 01:20:49.110
THAT WE HAVE POINTED OUT HERE

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:49.844
AND I THINK IT'S OUR

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:51.780
RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND THOSE

01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:53.748
THERE IS A CONTINUE TO PUSH. TO

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:56.551
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE THE AS

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.153
POSSIBLE AND THE FACT THAT THESE

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:00.355
THE POWER DIFFERENTIALS ARE SO

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:00.555
STARK.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:01.957
THE FACT THAT.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:03.191
THERE ARE PLENTY OF CASES WHERE

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:05.827
EMPLOYERS WILL REFUSE TO PAY AN

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.662
ARBITRATOR OR DRAG THAT PROCESS

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.831
OUT MEANS THAT IT IS NOT A AN

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:10.999
EXPEDIA PROCESS IT IS NOT A

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.268
QUICK PROCESS AND IT IS PART OF

01:21:13.335 --> 01:21:14.970
THE PRESSURE THAT EMPLOYERS SEEM

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:16.171
TO BE PUTTING VERY WILLING TO

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:19.374
PUT ON EMPLOYEES. TO NOT HAVE.

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.076
CASES HEARD AND TO IT TO

01:21:21.142 --> 01:21:23.912
INTERFERE WITH WITH QUICK AND

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.280
APPROPRIATE JUSTICE IN BECAUSE

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:27.482
ARBITRATION CASES ARE REALLY NOT

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.050
APPEALABLE IN.

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:30.218
THE BROADER SENSE WHAT WE

01:21:30.285 --> 01:21:32.187
NORMALLY SEE AN APPEAL I THINK

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:35.023
IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.025
TO PUSH THE LAW AND SEE MAKE

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:37.659
SURE THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:38.393
ARE.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.995
PROTECTING THE PEOPLE WHO NEED

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:41.429
US TO PROTECT THE MOST THAT'S

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.631
HOW I READ THIS BILL AND I

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.466
APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT

01:21:44.532 --> 01:21:45.667
IT FORWARD THANK YOU YOU MAY

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.635
CLOSE MISTER.

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:47.869
THANK YOU AND I AM I JUST WANNA

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:48.937
CLOSE BY FIRST OF ALL ONCE AGAIN

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.105
THINKING YOUR STAFF WHO DID AN

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.539
INCREDIBLE JOB IN HELPING US

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:52.307
CLEAN UP LANGUAGE --

01:21:52.374 --> 01:21:54.709
AND IT WAS MUCH APPRECIATED I AM

01:21:54.776 --> 01:21:56.278
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT LIKE

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.480
AGAIN THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHETHER

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:00.081
ARBITRATION IS A GOOD VENUE I AM

01:22:00.148 --> 01:22:01.650
I'M A BELIEVER IN ARBITRATION IF

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.151
IT'S ENTERED INTO VOLUNTARILY

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.519
AND THERE'S SOME --

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:05.987
POWER BALANCE I I THINK IT'S A

01:22:06.054 --> 01:22:08.857
GOOD METHOD --

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:09.491
BUT I THINK ALL METHOD SHOULD BE

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:14.195
ON THE TABLE WE WRITE --

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:15.630
CODE IT TO TO GO TO GOVERNMENT

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:16.698
CUT IF HE HAD IT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.466
FEATURE IN AND THAT THERE'S A

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:20.201
REASON BEHIND THAT IN IN SHORING

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:21.403
THAT WORKERS --

01:22:21.469 --> 01:22:23.071
WHEN THEY ARE TAKING A JOB

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.406
AREN'T TOLD BASICALLY YOUR

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.074
LIVELIHOOD OR SIGNING AWAY THESE

01:22:26.141 --> 01:22:26.775
RIGHTS --

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.043
THAT THAT WE NEED TO EXAMINE

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:29.210
THAT I THINK IT'S VERY NARROW

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.478
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO UNDO ANY

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:31.813
EXISTING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.348
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO UNDO ANY

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:34.649
FUTURE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:35.684
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.152
PROVIDE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TO

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:38.987
KEEP EMPLOYERS FROM FORCING AN

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:46.000
DIFFICULT TO SELECT

BURDEN OF JURY SERVICE ON OTHER

01:32:52.066 --> 01:32:53.401
IS STATEWIDE NOW.

01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:55.202
IMPROVING SOMEONE'S PROCESS TO

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.871
ALLOW REQUESTS FOR EXCUSES TO BE

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.014
COURTS MUST CONSTANTLY BALANCE

SO I HAVE LONG BEEN OPPOSED.

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:54.755
TO THESE EXEMPTIONS TO JURY

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.323
SERVICE JURY DUTY IS ONE OF THE

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.992
FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WE

01:34:58.059 --> 01:34:58.959
SERVE.

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.562
AS CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY AND

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:02.897
IF WE'RE GOING TO WHICH WE HAVE

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:04.732
AS OF LEGISLATIVE BODY WE HAVE

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.634
EXEMPTED CERTAIN FOLKS BECAUSE

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:08.402

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:09.537
ANY.

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:11.505
A NUMBER OF OTHER REASONS AND

01:35:11.572 --> 01:35:13.707
FOR ME LAST YEAR WE SAW THIS

01:35:13.774 --> 01:35:15.810
BILL AND WE EXEMPTED.

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.678
OR WE WE CARVED OUT.

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.647
THE CIVIL TRIALS BECAUSE THE THE

01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:21.082
ARGUMENTS THAT ARE MADE REALLY

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:22.650
DO NOT APPLY TO CIVIL TRIALS.

01:35:22.716 --> 01:35:24.018
AND THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE TAKEN

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:24.985
UP LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:26.320

01:35:30.324 --> 01:35:31.158
REMAIN.

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:32.893
AND EVEN IF ULTIMATELY THIS IS A

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.396
PILOT PROGRAM AND IT REQUIRES

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:36.163
SOME REPORTING BACK.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:37.098
BECAUSE IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:38.532
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PROBATION

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:40.668
OFFICERS AND I DO DISAGREE WITH

01:35:40.734 --> 01:35:42.703
SOME OF THE PROMISE OF WHY

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.838
BECAUSE PROBATION OFFICERS WORK.

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.372
AFTER THE FACT NOT BEFORE THE

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.941
FACT AND SO THAT DOES BEFORE

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.976
THAT THAT CONNECTION THAT DOES

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.977
NOT MEAN THAT THERE'S

01:35:50.044 --> 01:35:52.580
NECESSARILY A CONFLICT WHEN A

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:53.981
PROBATION OFFICER IS.

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:57.918
CALLED WHO CAN BE FAIR.

01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:59.053
IN A JURY GETS AT LEAST --

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.154
CONVICTION THEY MAY HAVE

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:01.355
INTERACTIONS WITH THOSE PEOPLE

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.424
OR PEOPLE OF SIR SIMILAR CLASS

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.559
LATER ON BUT THAT'S DURING THE

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.661
PROBATION PERIOD THAT'S NOT.

01:36:07.728 --> 01:36:09.897
AT THE TRIAL BECAUSE BE IN.

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.065
BEING A PROBATIONARY PERIOD

01:36:11.132 --> 01:36:12.199
MEANS THAT THAT THERE IS A

01:36:12.266 --> 01:36:13.767
CONVICTION [inaudible]

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.669
SO THAT.

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.238
THE THIS AROSE IN THIS KIND OF

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.405
CONSTANT AND WE GET THIS REQUEST

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.540
ALL THE TIME WHERE PEOPLE WANT

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.308
TO BE EXEMPTED FROM JURY SERVICE

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.343
BECAUSE IT'S IN CAN BE IN IT'S

01:36:22.409 --> 01:36:23.744
DIFFICULT TO DO.

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:24.912
AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO STOP

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:27.047
THE REQUEST SO IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:28.516
CONSIDER.

01:36:28.582 --> 01:36:30.084
PROBATION OFFICERS WHICH I TAKE

01:36:30.151 --> 01:36:32.353
IT AS A AS A VALID.

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.722
REQUEST THAT I THINK EVEN THE

01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:36.757
JUDICIAL COUNCILS CONCERNS THAT

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.292
WERE RAISED IN THE AND THE

01:36:38.359 --> 01:36:39.727
PROCESSES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE

01:36:39.793 --> 01:36:41.262
THERE ARE MORE.

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.796
THAT PROTECT AGAINST BIAS SO IF

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:45.032
THE IF A PROBATION OFFICER DOES

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.934
HAVE IN EXHIBITS THE BIAS OR A

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.135
CONNECTS TO THE CASE THEY COULD

01:36:48.202 --> 01:36:49.803
BE REMOVED FOR COST BY THE JUDGE

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:50.804
SO THERE ARE OTHER.

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:52.673
MECHANISMS THAT THE COURTS HAVE

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:53.474
IN PLACE.

01:36:53.541 --> 01:36:55.376
BUT IF WE DON'T IF WE'RE GOING

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:57.144
TO TAKE ANY STEPS LIKE THIS WE

01:36:57.211 --> 01:36:58.512
HAVE TO START TO BETTER

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.247
UNDERSTAND THE DATA BECAUSE SO

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:01.916
FAR GROUPS TO COME FORWARD AND

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:03.717
ASKING THE GIVE US ANECDOTAL

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:04.652
EVIDENCE THEY GIVE US.

01:37:04.718 --> 01:37:06.687
A MOTIONAL PEELS THEY SAY WE

01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:08.222
SHOULD BE EXEMPTED BECAUSE

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:09.924
WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY DATA

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:13.260
WITHOUT SHOWING WHAT THE IMPACT

01:37:13.327 --> 01:37:15.095
IS ON THE COURTS OR WHAT THE

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:16.463
NECESSITY IS.

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.631
SO WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED AS

01:37:17.698 --> 01:37:19.366
AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL IS A

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:21.268
PILOT PROGRAM.

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.137
AND REPORTING BACK SO THAT WE

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:24.438
REALLY GET OUR HANDS AROUND

01:37:24.505 --> 01:37:25.906
WHETHER THIS WOULD BE WHAT THE

01:37:25.973 --> 01:37:27.908
IMPACT OF REMOVING PROBATION

01:37:27.975 --> 01:37:28.542
OFFICERS FROM JURY POOLS WOULD

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.376
BE.

01:37:29.443 --> 01:37:30.544
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IT'S

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:33.781
ULTIMATELY NECESSARY AND IF ALSO

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.416
SETS A PROCESS WITH THE WHICH

01:37:35.482 --> 01:37:36.850
I'M HOPING THAT IF THERE ARE

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:38.485
OTHER GROUPS TO COME FORWARD TO

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:39.920
MAKE THIS REQUEST EVEN.

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:41.388
IF ULTIMATELY PROBATION OFFICERS

01:37:41.455 --> 01:37:43.457
GET THEIR WISH THAT ARE ALLOWED

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:44.725
TO BE EXCLUDED FROM JURY POOLS.

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.327
THEN WE HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH

01:37:46.393 --> 01:37:48.729
WE CAN ASK OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:50.431
TO COME FORWARD AND ESTABLISH

01:37:50.497 --> 01:37:51.899
FOR US WHY THEY SHOULD BE

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.601
REMOVED WHAT THE IMPACT IS.

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:55.102
AND THAT GIVES US I HOPE THE

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.238
BETTER ABILITY TO SAY NO OR IF

01:37:57.304 --> 01:37:59.173
THEY CAN ESTABLISH THE REASON

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.341
FOR BEING REMOVED FOR JURY POOLS.

01:38:00.407 --> 01:38:02.910
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHY RATHER THAN

01:38:02.977 --> 01:38:05.212
SPECULATION.

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.513
EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT BECAUSE A LOT

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:08.282
OF IT GETS DOWN TO THE FACT THAT

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:08.882
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SERVE ON

01:38:08.949 --> 01:38:09.817
JURIES.

01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:12.953
AND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.121
AND IT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.055
THIS COMMITTEE SO WHAT WE'RE

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:16.357
REALLY TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE IS

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:17.992
A BIT OF PROCESS BY WHICH WE CAN

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.727
TEST THE PROMISE.

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.662
GET SOME INFORMATION BACK AND

01:38:21.729 --> 01:38:23.430
HOPEFULLY BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:24.598
THE IMPLICATIONS ARETHAT'S

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:26.267
REALLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING IF

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:27.134
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.836
AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD TO THE

01:38:28.902 --> 01:38:30.271
POINT.

01:38:30.337 --> 01:38:31.605
NOT ALLOW.

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:33.674
THIS EXEMPTION UNTIL WE COLLECT

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.410
THE DATA BUT BECAUSE A PROBATION

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.311
OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:38.112
THAT.

01:38:38.178 --> 01:38:39.713
THAT THEIR INVOLVEMENT THERE IS

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.815
THERE IS SOME CREDIBLE ARGUMENT

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:43.083
TO IT I'M NOT SURE I COMPLETELY

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:44.318
BY ALL THE ARGUMENTS BUT AT

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.619
LEAST ENOUGH OF A CREDIBLE

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:45.886
ARGUMENT.

01:38:45.953 --> 01:38:47.755
THAT'S LET'S.

01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:49.823
ALLOW A PILOT PERIOD TO REALLY

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.425
STUDY THIS TO LOOK AT THIS THEN

01:38:51.492 --> 01:38:52.293
WE'LL KNOW BETTER WHAT WE'RE

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:54.161
DEALING WITH THAT'S WHAT I'M

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:55.462
ASKING I NOTICE OR SANTIAGO IS

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:56.864
NOT HAPPY WITH THIS PROCESS.

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:59.233
BUT I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.168
MAKE SURE.

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:04.138
THAT THIS THIS MOVES FOR THAT

01:39:04.204 --> 01:39:06.740
THIS MOVES THROUGH.

01:39:06.807 --> 01:39:07.341
BECAUSE YOU DO THAT WITH THE

01:39:07.408 --> 01:39:08.108
AMENDMENTS THAT I APPRECIATE

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:09.343
THAT BUT THAT I DO HOPE THAT

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:10.010
THIS MOVES FOR THROUGH THAT THAT

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:12.079
GIVES US SOME TANGIBLE.

01:39:12.146 --> 01:39:14.982
EVIDENCE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:17.184
WHETHER WHETHER IT'S AROUND

01:39:17.251 --> 01:39:18.452
PROBATION OFFICERS OR OTHERS.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:19.720
AS WE GET THIS REQUEST BECAUSE I

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.288
PROMISE YOU IF WE GRANT THIS

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:22.956
REQUEST WE WILL START GETTING

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:23.991
MORE AND MORE AND MORE.

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:26.927
AND THAT GETS HARDER AND HARDER

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:27.961
AND HARDER FOR ME IT IS

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:29.630
SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD

01:39:29.697 --> 01:39:32.066
DEFINITELY TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:33.300
BUT THE CAR.

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:34.335
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I DO

01:39:34.401 --> 01:39:35.703
APPRECIATE --

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.671
YOU'RE SAFEGUARDING HUH --

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.807
OF THE IT IN MANY WAYS THE

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:40.908
TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:43.477
OF THE SYSTEM INTEGRITY OF THE

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:45.045
JURY SELECTION PROCESS KNOWING

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:46.380
THAT OFTENTIMES.

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:47.881
IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE TO GET

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:51.685
PEOPLE EVEN WANT PARTICIPATE IN

01:39:51.752 --> 01:39:53.587
AND IN INJURIES AND I KNOW

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:54.655
SUPPORT FROM FOLKS OF OF THOSE

01:39:54.722 --> 01:39:55.522
OF US THAT HAVE.

01:39:55.589 --> 01:39:57.725
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:39:57.791 --> 01:39:59.226
PARTICIPATE IN JURY SELECTION IN.

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:00.961
HERE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:40:01.028 --> 01:40:02.262
EXCUSES PEOPLE.

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:04.231
PRESUMABLY IS WILL OF ALL ASSUME

01:40:04.298 --> 01:40:04.965
THAT THEY'RE ALL --

01:40:05.032 --> 01:40:07.267
OF THE UTMOST INTEGRITY BUT THE

01:40:07.334 --> 01:40:08.535
REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE.

01:40:08.602 --> 01:40:10.371
OFTENTIMES EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.706
OUT OF SERVING ON JURIES AND I

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.174
KNOW THAT IT'S ALWAYS A

01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:15.542
CHALLENGE FOR JUDGES --

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.978
TO BE ABLE TO EMPANEL A JURY I

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.246
WILL SAY --

01:40:19.313 --> 01:40:20.714
AND I DO APPRECIATE THE REPORT

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.116
AND AND TRYING TO AT LEAST GET A

01:40:22.182 --> 01:40:23.617
GRASS GONNA HANDLE.

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.219
OF WHAT KIND OF IMPACT OF THESE

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.887
KINDS OF EXEMPTIONS HAVE ON THE

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:27.888
SYSTEM.

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:31.392
AND I'LL SAY AS A A FORMER --

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:32.726
Là DEBBIE PUBLIC DEFENDER THAT

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.094
WHO HAD A FRANKLY A GREAT

01:40:34.161 --> 01:40:35.896
RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR PROBATION

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:37.631
APARTMENT PROBATION OFFICERS.

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:39.133
I DON'T THINK I WOULD HAVE

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:41.668
ALLOWED A PROBATION OFFICER.

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:45.672
NOW WHAT IS THAT BECAUSE OF MY

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:48.108
OWN BIASES OR BECAUSE OF IT'S

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.743
PRIDE MORE ANECDOTAL THAN IT IS

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.311
STATISTICAL --

01:40:51.378 --> 01:40:53.080
IN TERMS OF BIASES AND IT'S NOT

01:40:53.147 --> 01:40:54.715
THAT THE PROBATION OFFICERS WERE

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:56.250
BIASED PER SE.

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:57.551
I JUST THINK THAT HAVING SUCH AN

01:40:57.618 --> 01:41:00.988
IN DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF THE THE

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:02.022
CASES OF THE COME A JUST SYSTEM

01:41:02.089 --> 01:41:04.625
OF OUR CLIENTS --

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.827
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER TRIAL

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.328
INCLUDING.

01:41:08.395 --> 01:41:09.596
THEIR THEIR SLIP UPS AT TIMES --

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:10.931
I I JUST THINK IT'S AN INTIMATE

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:12.933
KNOWLEDGE OF OF THE SYSTEM THAT

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.135
AND THAT I BELIEVE WARRANTS.

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:16.336
THAT EXEMPTION BUT I DO

01:41:16.403 --> 01:41:18.472
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN BECAUSE

01:41:18.539 --> 01:41:19.873
I THINK IT'S A REAL ONE THAT.

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.141
THERE IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE WORRY

01:41:21.208 --> 01:41:22.576
HERE THAT --

01:41:22.643 --> 01:41:23.310
YOU CAN KIND OF MAKE THAT

01:41:23.377 --> 01:41:24.578
ARGUMENT AND AND PROBABLY A LOT

01:41:24.645 --> 01:41:27.214
OF OTHER AREAS AS WELL ALTHOUGH

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:29.483
I DO THINK WITH PROBATION.

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.618
THAT IT'S WITH ITS --

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:32.653
THE THE BASE OFFICER SO

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:33.487
INTIMATELY INVOLVED --

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:38.625
BUT THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:43.497
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO AT LEAST --

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:46.500
HAVE SOME KIND OF FOLLOW UP --

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.035
THE TO THE TO THE TO THIS BILL

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:50.070
IF IT DOES MAKE IT ALL THE WAY --

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:52.272
TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK ASSIGNED --

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.408
RATHER THAN JUST CREATING AN

01:41:54.475 --> 01:41:55.709
EXEMPTION AND KIND OF JUST NOT

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.110
NOT LOOKING BACK AND SO I LOOK

01:41:57.177 --> 01:41:59.046
FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT THE

01:41:59.112 --> 01:41:59.880
RESULTS OF A OF A SUBSEQUENT

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.048
REPORT WOULD BE.

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.883
AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE A A LOT

01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.685
OF FORMER COLLEAGUES MOTHER

01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:08.856
HAPPY THAT WE JUST SAY TO MUCH

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:10.290
PRESS THREE CHALLENGES.

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:11.658
WELL A AND THE THE PROPERTY

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:12.426
CHALLENGE IS PART OF THIS

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:13.060
BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEES ALWAYS

01:42:13.126 --> 01:42:14.661
PUSH BACK ON REDUCTION APPROACH

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:16.230
TO CHALLENGES THAT WAS PUT IN

01:42:16.296 --> 01:42:18.632
BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE IN THERE

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:19.900
NOW OR LIMITATIONS ON IT.

01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.102
IN THE PAST THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS

01:42:22.169 --> 01:42:23.637
AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN COURT

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:25.806
WERE OPPOSED TO THESE TWO OF MY

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:27.174
THREE PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:28.542
COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT OR

01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:30.043
HAVE BEEN OPPOSED.

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:31.678
BUT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES NOW

01:42:31.745 --> 01:42:33.380
BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATION OF

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.115
PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.

01:42:35.182 --> 01:42:36.450
IS THAT PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND

01:42:36.517 --> 01:42:39.553
OTHERS DON'T WANT TO USE THOSE

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:40.153
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT'S

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.488
WHY.

01:42:41.555 --> 01:42:43.423
LET'S GET SOME DATA LET'S FIGURE

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:46.026
OUT WHAT'S REAL AND THEN SEE

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.861
WHAT WHAT THE LANDSCAPE LOOKS

01:42:47.928 --> 01:42:50.097
LIKE AND AGAIN.

01:42:50.163 --> 01:42:52.733
I'M WILL IF THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:42:52.799 --> 01:42:54.268
APPROVED AND SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:55.435
PROBATION OFFICERS I'M LESS

01:42:55.502 --> 01:42:57.237
CONCERNED BUT I'M MORE CONCERNED

01:42:57.304 --> 01:42:58.605
WITH THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:00.173
AND THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS AND

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.475
THE NEXT GROUP THAT ASKS BECAUSE

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:02.509
THEY WELL.

01:43:02.576 --> 01:43:04.044
AND AT SOME POINT I WON

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:08.649
AFFIRMATIVELY STOP THAT SLIDE.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:09.850

WANT TO EXPAND --

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:21.895
THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE ALLOWED

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.230
TO BE EXEMPTED BUT I THINK FOR

01:43:23.297 --> 01:43:24.798

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.066
I AM -- I'D

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.635

BECAUSE OUR PROBATION OFFICERS

01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:48.956

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.314
CIRCUMSTANCE IN THAT RESPECT AND

JURY ONCE THEY SHOW UP AND THAT

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.317

01:45:46.673 --> 01:45:48.442
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND SO AT IN

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:50.277
THAT'S NOT JUST ON THE SIDE OF

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:51.311

01:45:58.218 --> 01:45:59.886
REQUEST WOULD BE --

01:45:59.953 --> 01:46:03.824
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:06.993
I'LL BE VOTING FOR THIS TODAY

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:07.294
[inaudible]

01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:12.132
THIS RARE.

THE ATTORNEYS ARE SPEAKING UP --

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:19.606
I I WOULD TEND TO AGREE.

01:46:19.673 --> 01:46:20.407
I WOULD TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT

01:46:20.474 --> 01:46:21.775
WITH THE COMMENTS MADE I THINK

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:25.112
THAT THE THE THE ONLY.

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:26.780
GOOD THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT

01:46:26.847 --> 01:46:28.482
THEY CAN STILL SERVE ON CIVIL

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.050
TRIAL CIVIL MATTERS.

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:31.118
SO THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY

01:46:31.184 --> 01:46:33.754
EXCLUDED FROM JURY SERVICE AND

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.255
IT APPEARS THAT THEY WERE

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:38.558
PROBABLY ONE TIRED --

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:40.160
IN MOST CRIMINAL CASES.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:41.828
BUT I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR --

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:43.764
THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:46.266
I WILL BE VOTING ON THIS TODAY --

01:46:46.333 --> 01:46:47.601
BECAUSE THEY CANCER OF ON CIVIL

THIS WHOLE.

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.813
WE'LL HEAR FROM A NON ATTORNEY

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.814
THAT'S WHY I'M GONNA.

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:04.384
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS A

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:07.220
NON ATTORNEY.

01:47:07.287 --> 01:47:10.657
ALL RIGHT WE CHECK THAT BOX.

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:12.359
ALL RIGHT THAT WAS SUCH A

01:47:12.425 --> 01:47:13.894
AGREEMENT CLOSE.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:16.997
THANK YOU ALSO THE NON ATTORNEY.

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:17.864
WELL LOOK I MEAN LOOK REAL ONE

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:18.431
ARE BILLS TO GET THERE AND

01:47:18.498 --> 01:47:19.099
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART BUT WE

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:19.599
ALSO APPRECIATE A GOOD

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:20.100
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AND

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.601
DISCUSSION --

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.737
SO LOOK I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE

01:47:23.804 --> 01:47:25.939
THOUGHTFUL APPROACH AND THE SHOW

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:28.308
THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WORKS --

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:28.875
AND I JUST WANTED TO COUPLE

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:31.812
THINGS THOUGH I MEAN IN TERMS OF

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:33.346
I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS A

01:47:33.413 --> 01:47:35.148
PLAYED A CASELOAD AND A PUBLIC

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:36.650
GOOD TO HAVING PEOPLE AT THEIR

01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:37.517
DESKS --

01:47:37.584 --> 01:47:38.451
WORKING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN'T

01:47:38.518 --> 01:47:39.352
PARTICULARLY OVER IN A

01:47:39.419 --> 01:47:40.520
CONVERSATION ABOUT RESTORATIVE

01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:42.389
JUSTICE PARTICULARLY WHEN WE

01:47:42.455 --> 01:47:43.657
WANT PEOPLE TO GET ON A BETTER

01:47:43.723 --> 01:47:46.793
PATH -- AND

01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.095
THAT'S ONE REASON THAT THE BILL

01:47:49.162 --> 01:47:50.764
AN OFFICER --

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:52.666
DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU LIKE THE

01:47:52.732 --> 01:47:53.934
PRO TO THE PROBATION OFFICER

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.734
DURING --

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:56.069
DURING A JURY --

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:57.671
PROCEEDING MAY HELP YOU IF YOU

01:47:57.737 --> 01:47:58.805
DON'T LIKE THE APPROACH OF A

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.307
POLICE OFFICER MAY MAY HURT YOU

01:48:00.373 --> 01:48:02.075
BUT THEY KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:03.910
ABOUT IT'S THAT JUST DEPENDS ON

01:48:03.977 --> 01:48:04.811
WHAT YOUR APPROACHES AND SO I

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:05.779
DECIDED THAT.

01:48:05.846 --> 01:48:07.380
THAT'S ABOUT IT POINT AND THEN I

01:48:07.447 --> 01:48:09.015
WOULD ARGUE THAT IN SOME CASES

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:09.950
THEY DO HAVE --

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:12.686
THEY MAY KNOW THE THE PARTICULAR --

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:13.353
DEFENDANT --

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.021
BECAUSE YOU YOU WE TALKED ABOUT

01:48:15.088 --> 01:48:16.456
THEM -- THAT

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:17.624
THERE'S A CONVICTION AFTER THE

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:18.258
TRIAL BUT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE

01:48:18.325 --> 01:48:19.526
MAY BE ON PROBATION WHEN THEY'RE

01:48:19.593 --> 01:48:20.727
GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:22.529
LIMITED AMOUNT BUT THIS IS WHAT

01:48:22.596 --> 01:48:24.130
WILL HAPPEN DURING THE A STUDY

01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:25.065
