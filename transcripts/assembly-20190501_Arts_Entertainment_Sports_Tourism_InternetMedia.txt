I'VE HAD  FRONT ROW BLEACHER SEATS TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT A MOM CAN SEE ALL THE JOY ALL THE HEARTACHE ALL THE SADNESS ALL THE STRUGGLE. ALL THE LAWS ALL THE WINS ALL THE VICTORIES AND EVERYTHING THAT COMES IN BETWEEN BUT AS A SINGLE MOM WITH FOUR SONS. THE ONLY THING I DO KNOW IS THAT WITHOUT FOOTBALL WITHOUT YOUTH AND HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. MY KIDS LIVES COULD HAVE GONE IN% A VERY VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION TODAY. FOR BOYS ALL OF THEM ARE OUT OF COLLEGE EXCEPT FOR ONE IS PLAYING BASEBALL. HE DIDN'T CONTINUE ON WITH A BALL THAT PLAYED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY ALL REMARK THAT THE BEST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES REALLY WERE WHEN THEY ALL FOUGHT WITH EACH OTHER -- WITH THEIR TEAMMATES TO WIN GAMES AND TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES -- ONE OF THEM WENT ON TO BE A OBVIOUSLY A SCHOLAR ATHLETE AND THAT STANFORD SO YOU KNOW WE WE ARE VERY MUCH OF AN EMBEDDED KICK UP. CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL FAMILY. SUPER HAPPY TO BE HERE CHECK. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. XENON ANY OPPOSITION PLEASE COME. FOR ONE OUNCE. FOLKS MY NAME IS RON WHITE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL ALLIANCE I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF GOLDEN EMPIRE FOOTBALL ON BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING FOUR THOUSAND YOUTH PARTICIPANTS I STAND IN SUPPORT TODAY OF AB. ONE THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. WE'VE COME FOR SEEN NOT OPEN TO DISCUSSION THE DIS [inaudible] ANY MEMBERS [inaudible] MS FREEMAN. WHERE SOCCER FAMILY BUT I CAN SUPPORT THIS TODAY? THIS CONCUSSIONS [inaudible] TO THE IS THERE ROOM. I THANK YOU THANKS THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING IT UP AND THANKS FOR THE WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT. HOW DOES THE PROCESS WORK WHO -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I JUST WANT TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHO'S ABLE [inaudible] TO HOLD -- THE ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTABLE. IS JUST GOING TO BE BASED ON LAWSUITS. OR IS THERE A BODY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. SO I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION -- SO THIS BILL HAS BEEN MODELED AFTER -- THREE OTHER BILLS -- AB TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN AND A. B. -- TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SO IN IN IN ALL THREE OF THOSE BILLS -- THERE THERE WAS NO FORMAL GOVERNING BODY THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT BODY IN ANY OF THOSE BILLS WE CARRY THAT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTION INTO INTO THIS -- WITHIN FURTHER ADDED WHAT I WOULD CALL A SELF GOVERNING DESIGN IN IN THE BILL SO THERE'S A THERE'S A STATUTE THERE THAT REQUIRES -- THE LEAKS TO DECLARE THEIR COMPLIANCE WITH AB. ONE A PUBLICLY WITH LANCE BEFORE YOU GO ON LET ME. FROM WHAT I RECALL CIF WAS INVOLVED IN THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THE BILLS SO SO SO IT'S AYE AYE. CIF IS THE THE HIGH SCHOOLS. I'M SORRY SO THE THOSE DOES OTHER THREE BILLS HAVE A PIC ABILITY TO THE THE THE AD CODE IN THE EDUCATIONAL CONSTRUCTS. BUT ALSO BEYOND THAT IN INTO -- CLUBS. SO THE THE DESIGN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT IT'S A SELF -- GOVERNING SITUATION BETWEEN PARENTS AND THE ASSOCIATIONS WHERE THE IF THE IF THE ASSOCIATIONS ARE REQUIRED THE FOOTBALL LEAGUES ASSOCIATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO STATE THEIR COMPLIANCE. WITH THE WITH AB ONE AND THE PARENTS WILL THEN HOLD THOSE -- THOSE LEAKS ACCOUNTABLE AND IF THE IF THE PARENT DOESN'T IF THE LEAGUE ISN'T IS NOT COMPLYING WITH AB ONE THE PARENT CAN MOVE THEIR CHILD TO ANOTHER TEAM THAT IS. MISSION -- SOFTENS A TO A QUESTION MARK YEAH I ALREADY KNOW SUPPORTER OF THE MANAGER -- JUST THE FOR THE PROTECTION OF LAW NO YOU ITS THE IN THIS IS SUPPORT [inaudible] FOR CONTACT. A PRACTICE SO PHONE THE OFF SEASON AND THE ONLY -- TWO TIMES AND NOT MORE THAN TWO TIMES A ONE HOUR EACH SO. SOUNDS LIKE ARE YOU YOU ARE ALLOWING IT UP BUT THAT'S A LIMITING THE PRACTICE TIME AND NOT SO DURING THE OFFSEASON IS THAT CORRECT SO -- IT MOSTLY CRACK I MAKE ONE CLARIFICATION SO WERE WERE -- LIMITING FULL CONTACT. IN SEASON TO NO MORE THAN TWO TIMES A WEEK. FOR THIRTY NO MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES HER PRACTICE SO THE THIS THIS IS A PROHIBITING DURING THE OFFSEASON HOURS ON A WRITE. OFF SEASON AS WELL. OFFSEASON OWNS HIS OWN SO THERE'S THERE'S IN SEASON AN OFF SEASON YEAH IN SEASON WHICH IS TYPICALLY -- BAD ABOUT CAMP AND PRACTICES THROUGH THROUGH THE WEEK OF GAMES WHICH IS TYPICALLY IN THE FALL -- THAT'S THE IN SEASON PERIOD PRACTICE FULL CONTACT IS LIMITED TO TWO TIMES A WEEK AT THIRTY MINUTES PER PRACTICE. THAT'S THE MOST STRINGENT GUIDELINES IN THE COUNTRY -- AND THEN THERE'S NO CONTACT ALLOWED IN THE OFF SEASON SO YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY YEAR ROUND TACKLE FOOTBALL. I SEE SO YOU ARE TRYING TO REDUCE THE PROBABILITY OF LET'S SEE VIA ACCIDENTS SELF. FOR ALLOWING FOR CONTACT US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CORRECT RIGHT NOW FACILITIES OTHER LEAGUES THEY CAN HIT FIVE DAYS A WEEK HIGH SCHOOLS RESTRICTED TO TWICE A WEEK FOR NINETY MINUTES SO THIS DEFINITELY COMPRESSES IT. MAKES A MUCH SAFER THOSE FOR THOSE YOUNG ATHLETES AS WITH MOST JUDGES IN THE COUNTRY. SOME COACHES WAIT FIVE DAYS A WEEK IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE COACHING LEVEL THIS REGULATES IT YEAH -- OKAY I'M I'M NOT A NEXT BUT IN FOOTBALL GAMES SO HOW. IN ALL NEGATIVE -- IMPACTS -- THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE COLLISION NOT BUT THE STEER YOU ARE ALLOWING ABOUT THE MINIMIZING THE FOR CONTACT OUT OF PURE YET THE WEATHER DISTORTED. IMPROVE THAT THEIR SAFETY OBVIOUSLY TO IT WE OUR OWN SELF BUT IT WHEN THEY GROW INTO A HIGH SCHOOL OR AND OF COLLEGE OFF. EVEN -- PROFESSIONAL LEVEL. I MEAN THEY I THOUGHT SOME FACT OF LIFE -- FOOTBALL IS SELF FOR CONTACT US SO WHEN YOU TRY TO LIMIT THAT THE WAY THAT THEY WILL BE FULLY TRAINED. FOR THE LATER NOT A LIFE I DON'T KNOW SO THAT SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I IN IN ADDITION TO MY ROLE WITH THE ALLIANCE I'VE BEEN -- AFFILIATED WITH -- FOOTBALL FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND POP WARNER YOUTH FOOTBALL FOR THIRTEEN OF THOSE YEARS -- I RUN A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PLAYER LEAGUE I'M SORRY SO STATION AND LARKSPUR CALIFORNIA -- I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN PRACTICING CONTACT TWICE A WEEK AT TWENTY MINUTES. I'M SO WITH THE ACTUAL PRACTICE IS IS IS IS ACTUALLY LESS AND WE'RE WE'RE VERY WE'RE VERY COMPETITIVE TEAM -- WE PLAY VERY SMART FOOTBALL WE'RE NOT THE BIGGEST WE'RE NOT THE STRONGEST WE JUST PLAY VERY VERY SMART INTELLIGENT -- AND WE WOULD PREPARE THE KIDS WELL SO -- THIRTY MINUTES TWICE A WEEK IS -- PLENTY OF TIME. IT CO INC COMBINED WITH -- ANOTHER -- REQUIREMENT OF THE BILL IS THE COACHES EVERY COACH OF EVERY FOOTBALL TEAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS REQUIRED TO GET CERTIFIED EVERY YEAR AND BLOCKING AND TACKLING TECHNIQUES THAT MINIMIZE THAT IMPLY. SO THIS COMBINATION OF EDUCATION TRAINING REDUCTION OF OF OF CONTACT TIME THESE ARE ALL LOT OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE THAT EXIST THAT WERE CODIFYING. I SEE. OKAY ANOTHER TEST OF SALT -- IS THAT THEY EAT R. I'M SURE HE FOOTBALL INDUSTRY I OR TRY TO COME UP WITH THE HELLO MATT SAID THAT WOULD PROTECT THE BRAINS TO WHATEVER. BUT THOUGH FROM MY THE KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THE WHATEVER SOFT. PAD THIS -- INSIDE. OF THE HELMET. I ONE THIRTY FIVE THERE IS ANY -- ONE TRYING TO DEVELOP BY. THE EXTERNAL IMPACT IS DOUBLE HARD TO YOU KNOW GET. A FACE TO FACE UP OUR HEARTS OF HIS CONTACT THAT THAT WORD WILL BE -- TO PENETRATE THE IMPACT. IF DOES SELF ABSORBED OVER MATERIAL X. TONE ON THE IN A SOFT. THAT THAT MAY BE AN IDEA. YEAH THAT THERE'S THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF TACKLE FOOTBALL PARTICULAR IN THE PAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS -- SO WE'VE MET WITH MULTIPLE HELMET PROVIDERS -- THE THE DESIGN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT A SOFTER EXTERNAL SHALL YES IS REALLY A BODY BY A COMPANY CALLED VICES OUT OF SEATTLE. WASHINGTON WHERE THEY HAVE A THEY'VE THEY'VE PUT FORWARD THIS YEAR USED TACKLE FOOTBALL HELMET -- SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR YOU THAT HAS A SOFT. S. HAS AN OUTER SHELL THAT ACTUALLY GIVES WAY YES ENOUGH ISN'T A HARD ABSOLUTELY SHELL. JUNGLE SO WHERE YOU HAVE LIKE A SHOCK ABSORBER RIGHT. AND VIRGINIA TECH -- TESTS HELMETS OF EVERY YEAR TO CERTIFY THEM AND PUT THEM ON A FIVE STAR SCALE AND PROVIDES RATINGS OF WHAT THE BEST HOW MUCH ARE. SO THERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT -- ADVANCEMENTS IN IN THAT INDUSTRY AND THERE'S EVEN THERE'S OTHER ORGANIZATION -- LIGHT HELMETS OUT OF SAN DIEGO CALIFORNIA THAT HAS THE LIGHT IS COMING ON THE MARKET. AND THE DATE SO THERE AND THAT THAT HOME IS BASED UPON MILITARY AND AEROSPACE THE TECHNOLOGY. SO THERE'S LOTS OF MANAGEMENT AND AND FRANKLY LIGHT HELMETS -- THE LIGHTER HELMET FOR USED IS A VERY INTERESTING OPTION BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE NECK. AND THE ABILITY TO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A THREE AND A HALF POUND HELMET THEIR HOME AND I THINK IS TWO POINT. TWO POINT THREE POUNDS -- SO THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR KIDS IN AND BASED UPON THE KIND OF PLAYER THE POSITION SOME HELMETS MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE. THAN OTHERS. SO GLAD TO HEAR THAT -- INDUSTRIES -- DOING THAT KIND OF A RESEARCH AND YOU KNOW IT IT IT BRINGS UP A GREAT POINT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE FOUND OF THE CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL LINES IS THERE'S A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE. REGARDING -- FOOTBALL AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SHEPHERD THAT DOWN A PATH TO HELP ORGANISATIONS MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CHOICES. YEAH IF AND WHEN THEY HAVE A VERY -- SAFE I HAVE MET THAN YOU CAN WE CAN YOU KNOW UNDO THIS REGULATION. THERE'S THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FOR GREAT TECHNIQUE AND KEEP THE HEAD OUT OF THE GAME AND ACTUALLY THE BEST TECHNIQUE THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS. THE BILL USED AHEAD WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHEN I PLATING AND AND AND GRADE SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL COLLEGE IT'S A COMPLETE DIFFERENT GAME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER COOPER. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- LAST YEAR WILL. THIS COMMITTEE IS WORKING. FOR A VERY VERY SIMILAR BILL LIKE YOURS -- WE'RE TRYING -- TO WORKING WITH SOME OTHER MEMBERS. BUT A BECAUSE IT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT. A LOT OF THE HEAD INJURIES. THAT DOESN'T REALLY NOT NECESSARILY HOW OFTEN IN MEDIA A FACT BUT WHEN THEY GROW TO A OLDER AGE. AND OR SOME A STUDY SHOWS THAT -- THE INCREASING THE THE HEAD TRAUMA AND ALSO BECAUSE THE KIDS OR TO USE. THEIR BRAINS ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED THERE ARE MORE -- VULNERABLE -- TO TO TO TO TO JUST KIND OF THE THE CUT REPEAT IT -- HEAD TRAUMA SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS IS -- I WOULD DEFINITELY ASK MY SUPPORT TOUR. AND YOU JUST BE THE WAY TO WORK AB ONE THE FIRST BILL INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE. A GOOD THIS YEAR SO -- WITH STRAT -- BUT ON SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB ONE COOPER DE PASSED TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR KANSEN CHU HI KANSEN CHU BY DEEP. DEEP HI DAVID CHIU. DAVID CHIU AYE CHOI. CHOI NINE FRIEDMAN. I MISS ARIAN. IS ARIANNA [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER IS IN THE HOUSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LABOR SORRY I'M RUNNING LATE HERE AT THE CHAIR OF ELECTIONS COMMITTEE -- TO JUST GOT DONE DOING THAT AND CAME RIGHT DOWN HERE I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A. B. -- THIRTEEN SIXTEEN NO CALIFORNIA WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING A LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO FREE SPEECH. WITH THAT IN MIND I BELIEVE THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO ALLOW FREE SPEECH. ON THOSE WHO USE THEIR PLATFORMS I NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS OR AFFILIATIONS MIGHT BE AB THIRTEEN SIXTEEN TO PROHIBIT ANY PERSON WHO OPERATES. A SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNET WEBSITE -- IN CALIFORNIA FROM REMOVING OR MANIPULATING CONTENT ON THE PURELY ON THE BASIS OF POLITICAL AFFILIATION. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO BLOCK. HATE SPEECH THERE WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO BLOCK THE OBSCENITY -- THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BLOCK -- INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE -- ALL THOSE THINGS YOU KNOW ARE ARE PROTECTED THEIR FLOW. OUR FIRST AMENDMENT CASE LAW MAKES VERY CLEAR THOSE THINGS CAN BE BANNED AND CAN BE BLOCKED -- AND THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO BE THIS THIS BILL ALSO. ALLOWS THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS UP FRONT AND SAY LOOK WE WILL BLOCK CONTENT. MAYBE THEY WANT TO SAY HEY LOOK WE ARE A CONSERVATIVE SIDE ONLY FOR EXAMPLE AND WE'RE ONLY GONNA. ALLOW CONSERVATIVE VIEW POINTS TO BE EXPRESSED ON ON THIS -- WEBSITE -- OR MAYBE THEY WANT TO SAY WE ARE OF YOU KNOW PROGRESSIVES ONLY. WELL WEBSITE AND AN ESTABLISHED THAT CLEARLY ON THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS WE WE WILL NOT POST -- YOU KNOW CERTAIN THINGS -- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE IF IF THAT WAS CLEARLY WITHIN THEIR TERMS -- IN CONDITIONS -- BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE ALTERNATELY IS IT LOOK THESE PLATFORMS NOW BECOME -- YOU KNOW PLACES WHERE WE ARE DEBATING YOU KNOW ISSUES OF PUBLIC CONCERN WE WERE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WHERE WHERE. WE AS CANDIDATES WERE ELECTION HEARING. ON THESE WEBSITES TO GET INFORMATION OUT IN THE VIEW POINTS OUT -- AND I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE -- CURRENTLY IN OUR SOCIETY IS WE'VE WE HAVE WE HAVE BEGIN THE ISOLATE OURSELVES SO MUCH SO. THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR. OTHER VIEW POINTS AND WE DON'T HEAR OTHER VIEW POINTS AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE IN A IN A CIVIL SOCIETY. IN ORDER FOR TO BE HEALTHY WE NEED TO HEAR LOTS OF DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS -- THIS WAS SORT OF ON I THINK THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED THE MULLER REPORT. ACTUALLY WHERE THE RUSSIAN -- ME OF THE RUSSIAN THE INTERESTS THAT WERE INTERFERE ELECTIONS THEY WERE CREATING. SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS. TO SPECIFICALLY GO TO AREA STE TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET LIKE ISOLATED GROUPS TEA PARTY. BLACK LIVES MATTER -- YOU KNOW AND IN DIFFERENT THEY WERE YOU KNOW THEY WERE TRYING TO BASICALLY TARGET IN SIGHT THOSE GROUPS TO GET ANGRY ABOUT AN ISSUE IN ORDER TO SOW DISCORD -- AND I THINK WHEN WHEN WE WHEN WE ALLOW OURSELVES BECOME MORE ISOLATED THIS IS BEEN FURTHER EXACERBATED BUT WE KNOW THAT FACEBOOK ACTUALLY STARTED ALGORITHM. WHERE YOU WOULD GET MORE OF THE CONTENT THAT WE THINK YOU LIKE -- HEY AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS THAT YOU START GETTING ONLY VIEW POINTS THAT THEY THINK YOU LIKE IF YOU'RE CONSERVATIVE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET CONSERVATIVE VIEWPOINT SEVERE. PROGRESSIVE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET THOSE VIEWPOINTS I THINK THAT CONTINUES. TO REALLY MORE DIVIDE US AN ISOLATED US. RATHER THAN DO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WHICH IS ALLOW FOR THAT FREE FLOW OF DEBATE AND DISCUSSION -- I LEARN MORE. BY HEARING FROM PEOPLE FROM OTHER VIEWPOINTS MIA. AS SAID IN LAST COMMITTEE IN -- MY AUNT AND MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE I'VE BEEN SURROUNDED BY LIBERALS YOU KNOW WHAT TO UC BERKELEY. UC DAVIS -- NHÃ  NOT NOT NOW I'M IN IN IN THIS BODY. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY I'M PROBABLY A A MINORITY VIEWPOINT -- NOT ALWAYS BUT ON A LOT ISSUES. BUT I THINK WE GAIN FROM HEARING EACH OTHER'S PERSPECTIVES. FOR ME MAY BE HEARING FROM A RURAL PERSPECTIVE -- YOU KNOW FROM ISSUES RELATED TO WATER AND HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR AREA IN THE NORTH. LEARNING FROM MY OF MY COLLEAGUE THE CHAIRMAN ABOUT ISSUES THAT AFFECT SAN JOSE AND AND HOUSING ISSUES AND TRANSPORTATION ISSUES. THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE KEEP THAT KIND OF FREE FLOW OF DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WHERE THERE WHERE THEY HAVE BECOME -- THESE PLACES WHERE WE HAVE AND WE NEED TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AS A COUNTRY -- YOU KNOW IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND AS A STATE. SO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES. TO A SUPPORT OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS KEVIN MCKINLEY. AND THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR INTERNET SO SHE XIN WHICH REPRESENTS OVER FORTY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INTERNET COMPANIES. THE INTERNET HAS BECOME WHAT IT IS TODAY THANKS TO THE FACT THAT IT'S FREE OPEN IN ACCEPTING OF YOU POINTS AFFILIATIONS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. PEOPLE FROM EVERY POLITICAL WALK OF LIFE CONFINED COMMUNITIES IN CONTENT THAT INTEREST THEM. IN POLITICAL INTERNET PLATFORMS ENABLE EVERYONE TO LEARN. AND SHARE AND DEBATED FIRST IF USING TOPICS. HOWEVER THIS BILLS BASED ON FLAWED PREMISE. THAT MODERATION DECISIONS ARE BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS THEY'RE NOT BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS. ONLINE PLATFORMS AND FORCE COMMUNITY STANDARDS WHICH ALLOW USERS TO FEEL SAFE SECURE BOTH ONLINE AND OFF. DID EXTENT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER ENVISIONS INTERNET PLATFORMS LISTING OUT. VARIETIES OF POLITICAL SPEECH THAT ARE UNACCEPTABLE ON THE PLATFORM IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE WAY THAT MODERATION DECISIONS ARE MADE TODAY. THE PLAN FOR SEDATE REMOVE CONTENT THE POSES A THREAT OF HARM OR PUBLIC SAFETY. OR PROMOTES HATRED HATRED% VIOLENCE -- AGAINST CERTAIN GROUPS SO ALLEGATIONS THE PLATFORMS ENGAGE AND POLITICALLY BIASED MODERATING IS NOT CORRECT. OR THAT PRACTICES LIKE SHADOW BANNING -- CONSERVATIVES ON SOCIAL MEDIA. IS ALSO NOT CORRECT SO TO THE EXTENT THIS BILL WILL IMPEDE PLATFORMS ABILITY TO MODERATE YOU KNOW TROLL SPREADING ELECTION MISINFORMATION. OR VIDEOS CLAIMING THAT THINGS LIKE SANDY HOAX WERE A HOAX WE FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE -- WE THINK THAT THIS BILL WILL ALLOW BAD ACTORS TO CLAIM THAT THEY'RE BEING CENSORED FOR POLITICAL REASONS WHEN IN FACT OF BEING BANNED OR MODERATED FOR OTHER REASONS -- AND NOT BEING BASED ON YOU KNOW THE SENSOR BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT AT ALL. SO PEOPLE ARE YOU USE THESE PLATFORMS TO FIND CONTENT THEY LIKE SOME USERS ONE PARTICULAR CONTENT. SOME USERS ASK PLATFORMS NOT SHOW THE CONTENT THEY FIND OBJECTIONABLE. AND THIS BILL WOULD UNDERMINE PLATFORMS TOOLS TO SERVE THE USERS -- SO AGAIN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL IS IMPEDING MODERATION AND ALLOWING. BAD ACTORS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TO HAVE ANOTHER AVENUE FOR CLAIMING THAT THEY'RE BEING. MODERATED THE CONTENTS BEING SENSOR BASED ON VIEWPOINT. WHEN THAT'S NOT THE CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DAY US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. TO WHICH ALL DIFFERENT MISTER CHOI CHU. CHU. CHOI. HERE IS A POLITICAL VIEWS ARE OF THAT THAT CONTENT EXCEPT THE S. A PROVIDED A BY. SO IN OTHER WORDS SO. IF THE SET UP. ORG Z. -- THE PURPOSES SO WE ARE TRYING -- TO PROMOTE HERE'S THE RULE OF LAW FOR THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH IF THE SET UP BY HEY WE HAVE ALL RIGHT -- TO CAN I IS SET UP THEIR OWN NON POLITICAL VIEWS -- IN THEIR EXCEPTION EXCEPT HERE IN THAT LINE. ALL THAT AND NOW WE ARE STUCK. IN THE STORE I MEAN. THEY THEY CAN THEY CAN INCLUDE THAT THEY'RE A WHATEVER WE ARE TRYING. TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR LIKE A POLITICAL VIEW-- SO -- THINGS LIKE THAT -- AND THEN -- THEY WE HAVE A RIGHT. TO IN ALL MONITOR POLITICAL VIEWS OR WHATEVER IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T AGREE WITH YOU WITH AND HOW WE IN ALL. OF PROTECT THAT THE FREEDOM FREEDOM OF SPEECH. ARE THAT THEY CANNOT INCLUDE DOT IN THAT THE EXCEPTION. THE EXECUTIVE SEARCH IS RUNNING QUESTION. NOW I WAS A TEACHER. TO ORDER FOR TO THE ALSO YOU WANT TO ANSWER IT NOW OR ANSWERING YOUR CLOSING WELL I I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- DOCTOR CHOI IS IS SAY THAT -- IN GENERAL WE WANT TO PROVIDE FOR A FREE FLOW OF IDEAS ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO GET AT THE ALSO OF RIGHT TO ASSOCIATE. YOU HAVE THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND SO. CERTAIN -- WHETHER IT'S MAYBE A A BLOG PAGE OR OF A PAGE THAT IS SET UP ON SOCIAL MEDIA -- MAY SAY LOOK WE ARE A REST OF SITE WE ONLY WELCOME PROGRESSIVE DISCUSSION AND YOU POINTS HERE AND THEY AND THEY STATE THAT CLEARLY ON THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S THE POINT IS PUT THAT IN YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS UP FRONT SO EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S THE CASE. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FACEBOOK'S PLATFORM FOR EGGS I'M JUST USING FACEBOOK HAS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY USED -- THEY DON'T DO THAT RIGHT THEY SAY HEY COME ON AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS THEY DO HAVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- BUT THEY INVITE EVERYBODY TO COME ON TO THE PLATFORM AND AND AND EXPRESS VIEWPOINT SHARE THINGS WITH THEIR FRIENDS -- AND AND SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE -- YOU SHOULD ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF IDEAS UNLESS THE ISSUE IS. AND LOOK AT THINK OUR BILL ADDRESSES THIS IF THE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OBSCENITY. YUP PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES. YOU KNOW -- IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE LIKE CLIMB FOR THE KILLING OF POLICE OFFICERS FOR EXAMPLE -- OR YOUR YOU YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- NO ISSUES INVOLVED WITH -- MISS SIMPLE MASON RIGHT EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU COULD STILL TAKE DOWN. BUT YOU CAN'T BLOCK. THE INFORMATION PURELY BASED ON ITS POLITICAL CONTENT. OKAY AS OF RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AB. APPRECIATE YOU -- EXPLAINING WE'RE COMING FROM WITH THE BILL I MUST CALL THE LAST NIGHT AFTER READ THIS BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S DRAFTED ATTRACTED HUNDREDS OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- IN A PAST LIFE AND AND I HAVE NOT SEEN TO THE CHALLENGES THAT I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE LET ME STATE AT THE OUTSET I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE WANT TO FOSTER -- A FREE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION -- I THINK THE WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GATHERING IS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE SOME THERE ARE. THAT SOMEHOW THE TEAS AND SEE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE NOT. ADEQUATE -- I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS FOR MAJOR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THEY ALL HAVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS RIGHT RED OKAY SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SOLVE THAT. BUT YOUR BILL SAYS -- IF YOU'RE OPERATING A WEBSITE YOU SHOULD REMOVE OR MEDICALLY CONTENT UNLESS IS PROVIDED BY THE SOCIAL MEDIA. WEBSITES TERMS AND CONDITIONS BUT YOU DON'T PROVIDE ANY GUIDANCE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE IN THOSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS YOU SIMPLY SAY YOU LEAVE IT UP TO THE WEBSITE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SHOULD BE IN THE CITY'S SEES. RIGHT RIGHT. SO IF THERE'S NO GUIDANCE AND THESE IN OF ALL OF THE COMPANIES OR TALK ABOUT HAVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND WHAT ARE YOU SOLVING WITH THIS BILL. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION I'M JUST TRYING TO REALLY ESTABLISH THAT LOOK WE DON'T WANT TO BLOCK. CONTENT PURELY BASED ON POLITICAL -- VIEWED THE POLITICAL VIEWPOINT BRANCH I THINK IS ALREADY AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE ANYWAY AND BUT YOU KNOW BUT STILL LIVE IN WE KNOW% FROM FIRST MEMBER THAT YOU CAN BLOCK THINGS THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE NOT PROTECTED SPEECH. AS AS YOU ALREADY WENT THROUGH BUT I'M ALSO YES GIVING YOU KNOW STILL GIVING -- THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THIS COMING BECAUSE THEY ARE PRIVATE COMPANY THEY'RE NOT. THERE ARE NOT THE GOVERNMENT -- HOWEVER THERE WERE IN THIS KIND OF GRAY ONE WORLD A LITTLE BIT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE NOT THE GOVERNMENT BUT WE KNOW THAT FACEBOOK IS USE A LOT AS AT A PLATFORM FOR A LOT OF ISSUES A DISCUSSION. THEY'RE A MATTER OF PUBLIC CONCERN I MEAN ALL OF US HAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS. WE SEE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY MUCH A LOT OF POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS THAT GO ON ON VARIOUS ISSUES. THE BILLS THAT WERE RUNNING AFTER ENTER A SUBJECT TO THOSE THINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK AND FORTH. ON THE SINK SO THERE IS IT VERY MUCH HAS BECOME. SORT OF A BECAUSE I HAD LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM RIGHT AND SO WE WANT TO PROTECT THAT WHILE ALSO GIVING THE PRIVATE COMPANY. THE ABILITY USE THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS TO STATE OUT RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY HEY HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE OUR SITE AND YOU HAVE TO ABIDE BY THOSE CONDITIONS ARE WE WILL -- YOU KNOW. BLOCKING YOUR OR TAKE DOWN YOUR POST. WHAT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT -- THE COMPANIES ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL HAVE VERY CLEARLY LAID OUT TERMS AND CONDITIONS THERE ARE MANY MANY LAWYERS AND INTERNAL FOLKS WITHIN COMPANIES SPENT A LOT OF TIME FIGURE THIS OUT AND THEY DO LAID OUT AND I WILL SAY PERSONALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. I WISH THAT THE COMPANIES THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE TO ADDRESS THE HATE SPEECH IN THE VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE AND I'LL JUST GIVE EXAMPLES ONE I HAVE PROPOSED PRO LGBT. BILLS THE VIOLENTLY HATEFUL AND HOMOPHOBIC COMMENTS THAT WE GET ON OUR WEBSITES ARE ARE VERY INTENSE WHEN I PROPOSED PRO GUN SAFETY BILLS. THE SUPPORTERS OF GUN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VERY VIOLENTLY AND VEER AT LADY -- OUTSPOKEN IN THEIR PERSPECTIVE WHEN I PROPOSE PRO IMMIGRANT. LAWS -- ANTI IMMIGRANT FORCES -- DESCEND ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE AND OTHER PAGES IN A VERY INTENSE WAY -- AND FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THERE'S ACTUALLY VERY LITTLE CENSORSHIP IF NOT NO CENSORSHIP THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AGAIN I'M JUST. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE A WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS -- YOU'RE LAYERING ON A RULE THAT SAYS IF YOU OPERATE A WEBSITE. YOU CAN'T REMOVE THIS CONTENT AND LET'S IT'S PROVIDED BY YOUR THIESSEN SEES BUT THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING SO I'M JUST NOT IT TO ME FEELS LIKE THIS IS JUST CONFUSING. WHAT THE STANDARD OUGHT TO BE FOR FOR THESE COMPANIES AND AND AGAIN AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT ALSO INTERACTED WITH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS? WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT I JUST DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT CONFUSING THE ROLE SO I'M WONDERING IF THE INTERNET CESSATION KIND OF WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES YOU'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES HAS BEEN? YEAH I THINK THE QUESTION AND I I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF MODERATING CONTENT I MEAN I THINK WE'RE HEARING THAT. UNIVERSALLY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY AND INTERNET ASSOCIATION MEMBERS IN THE BIG INTERNET PLATFORMS ARE TRYING TO DO BETTER MODERATING CONTENT SO I HEAR YOU ON THAT AND WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU -- FUNDAMENTALLY THE PLATFORMS DO NOT MODERATE BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT THEY MODERATE BASED ON HATE SPEECH INCITEMENT ETCETERA. SO THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE WITH THIS BILL THIS BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT OR MAKE IT BETTER. BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT GIVES. FOLKS WHO ARE MODERATED OR CENSORED AN AVENUE TO POINT SEE THIS IS ACTUALLY BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT. AND ONE PERSON HATE SPEECH MAYBE ANOTHER PERSON'S POLITICAL VIEWPOINT RIGHT I MEAN. WE SEE THAT A LOT NGUYEN. YOU KNOW COMMENTATORS WHO ARE YOU KNOW PERPETRATING YOU KNOW HOAX VIDEOS ETCETERA DO GET SENSORS SAYING IT'S BECAUSE I'M CONSERVATIVE IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE CONTENT. SO WE THINK THIS ACTUALLY DOESN'T REMEDY THE SITUATION -- CONTENT STILL TO BE MODERATED BASED ON EXISTING TERMS OF SERVICE AND WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO IS CREATE FURTHER DIVISION BY GIVING -- FOLKS AN INCORRECT VIEW TO POINT TO A SINGER MODERATING ME BASED ON POLITICAL VIEWPOINT LOOK AT THE RECOGNITION CALIFORNIA LAW YOU CAN'T DO THAT. AND WE'RE STILL MODERATING NEED DO A BETTER JOB OF CLEANING UP THE PLATFORMS TO ADDRESS THE THINGS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED. I AM HAPPY TO CONTINUE ENGAGE IN THE CONVERSATION BUT BUT I'M JUST WORRIED THAT WE'RE OR ACTUALLY MAKING THINGS MORE CONFUSING FOR STANDARDS AS OPPOSED TO LESS AND SO FOR THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT AGAIN WE SHOULD WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF MAKING. SURE THAT THERE IS A FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION I JUST WANT THAT TO BE DONE AS CLEARLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU MISTER OF THIS AREA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THIS IS. TYPE I WASN'T GOING TO BRING THIS UP. BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA -- COMPANY THAT ACTUALLY BART THIS SPEECH BUT THIS IS NOT A QUESTION IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT AND SINCE IT JUST HAPPENED RECENTLY AS OF APRIL. TWENTY SEVEN I THOUGHT I JUST RAISE IT AT THIS COMMITTEE HEARING AND THEN I'LL DO MY DUE DILIGENCE OF FOLLOWING UP. ALSO WITH THE WITH I DON'T EVEN WANT TO MENTION THE NAME OF THE COMPANY THE SOCIAL MEDIA INVOLVED HERE. BUT A FRIEND OF MINE WHO POSTED ABOUT HER GRANDMOTHER'S PLIGHT IN SURVIVING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE -- THE POST WAS LABELED AS HATE SPEECH AND REMOVED. TO HAVE THIS IS THE COUNTER OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT EVEN. WHAT EVEN IS? WHAT EVEN IS CONSIDERED HATE SPEECH -- HIS EIGHT I DON'T THINK THIS WOULD OF BEEN LABELED AS SUCH. IT'S A IT'S A THREE PARAGRAPH -- COMMENT TALKING ABOUT THE NEAREST RELIEF THE REFUGEE STATUS -- AND HOW SHE'S BEEN ABLE TO THRIVE BECAUSE OF HER GRANDMOTHER'S PERSEVERANCE -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT ABOUT THAT AND I DON'T WANNA READ THROUGH THIS MISTER CHARM HAPPY TO PROVIDE A PHOTOCOPY OF THIS. BUT THIS WAS JUST ONE OF THE MOST I'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE WAIT LEAVES YOU SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD THINKING WHAT WAS THE HATE SPEECH IN THIS. CONTENT -- SO. I ALMOST FEEL ON ON ANOTHER AND THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME DEFINITION OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED. WHAT WHAT'S THE STANDARD? SO THAT ARBITRARILY THINGS LIKE THIS THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S HISTORY AND PLATE. OF BECAUSE THIS JUST RAISES A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS OF WHY IS THIS BEING MONITORED. ON WHOSE BEHALF WHOSE INTEREST AND WHY WOULD SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS SO WELL WRITTEN SO WELL DOCUMENTED BE CONSIDERED HATE SPEECH. SO -- AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I NEED TO DO MY DUE DILIGENCE ON BUT GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BRING UP BECAUSE YOU ALMOST WANT TO HAVE EVEN MORE CLARITY ON KNOWING WHAT WILL BE CONSIDERED AS HATE SPEECH SO THAT. SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOESN'T FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY -- AND I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THIS TO MISTER CHAIR AND TO THE MEMBERS AS WELL. THANK YOU. MS FREEMAN. ART SO -- I APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND I LIKE MR CHIU VERY MUCH -- AGREE WITH YOUR UNDERLYING CONCEPT THAT. WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT -- ENTER SHIP OF POLITICAL VIEWS -- BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER IF YOU TALK TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT THEY WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS HAPPENING A LOT MORE TO THE LEFT. THEN TO THE RIGHT AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF YOUR FAR LEFT ACTIVISM MY DISTRICT TO CONSTANTLY GET KICKED OFF OF VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA SITES AND THEN KIND OF FIND A WAY TO GET BACK IN AND GET KICKED OFF AGAIN -- I HAVEN'T DELVED INTO EXACTLY WHY BUT IT SEEMS TO BE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY -- PROBLEM SO -- IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER THAT IT'S NOT JUST FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM I CAN GUARANTEE YOU YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF THESE COMPLAINTS FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S YOU THE THE PROBLEM THAT I SEE WITH SOCIAL MEDIA GOES SO MUCH DEEPER AND HAS SO MUCH MORE TO DO WITH THEIR ALGORITHMS. HELP CONTENTS FILTERED AND FED BACK TO PEOPLE -- CREATING -- KIND OF ECHO CHAMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY BE EXPOSED TO THEIR OWN VIEWS WHICH IS NOT A QUESTION OF CENSORSHIP IT'S A QUESTION OF A EYES AND ALGORITHMS AND HOW THEY CHOOSE. TO FEED CONTENT TO PEOPLE WHICH THIS BILL DOESN'T YOU KNOW ADDRESSING WHICH IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT THERE I WOULD HOPE OR THINKING ABOUT AT THIS POINT [inaudible] AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON. AND THEY'RE DEALING WITH THEIR ISSUES OF BOTS AND MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS AND THAT. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY ABOUT WHO'S BEHIND ACCOUNTS THAT THEN START TO SHAPE OPINIONS AND HOW THAT ENDS UP THROUGH THEIR OWN PAID ADVERTISING BECOME EVEN BECOMING EVEN MORE AMPLIFIED. AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THESE WITH A LOT OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. YOU KNOW VERY DEEPLY CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH SITES LIKE FACEBOOK. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YOUR TIME TO JUMP INTO A BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WHAT THEY NEED. IS A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE KIND OF DECONSTRUCTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WAYS OF DEALING WITH IT AND I DO THINK THAT THIS BILL YOU KNOW WHILE I I AGREE VERY WELL INTENTIONED I DON'T KNOW THAT IT REALLY HELPS MOVE THAT. EFFORT FORWARD IN THE WAY THAT IT NEEDS TO BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIGGER [inaudible] ISSUE THEN. YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE CENSORING PARTICULAR POLITICAL VIEWS WHICH THEY MAY OR MAY NOT BE BUT EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T AND I WILL TAKE HIM AT FACE VALUE THAT THEY'RE NOT. THERE'S STILL STUFF THAT'S THAT IS GOING SIDEWAYS HERE THAT'S THAT'S LEADING AND AND IN TERMS OF SUCH AS A BY I HAVE A GUN BILL RIGHT NOW. THERE'S THE VERY THINLY VEILED VIOLENT THREATS ON MY OFFICIAL PAGE THAT. NO ONE'S TAKING DOWN I'M NOT GONNA YOU KNOW REPORT IT MYSELF BUT I IF IF THAT KIND OF CONTENT WAS ROUTINELY BEING CENSORED WE WOULDN'T BE SEEING THESE POSTS POPPING UP LIKE WE ARE -- AND THEN THE SITUATION THAT MISTER NAZARIAN DESCRIBES YOU KNOW VERY TROUBLING AS WELL YOU KNOW WHO GETS TO FLAG THESE AND WHO'S MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND UNDER WHAT SET OF CRITERIA SO. I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY I EVEN THOUGH I AGREE WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF WHAT'S BEHIND IT I JUST THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO BE A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT AND HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYBODY. YOU KNOW WHO WANTS TO TO BRING THAT FORWARD INCLUDING THE SITES THEMSELVES AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ENGAGED IN THAT ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. BUT YOU KNOW THEY MAY VERY WELL SEE MORE EFFORTS LIKE THIS COMING FROM CALIFORNIA AS WE SEE MORE REAL HARM. BEING INFLICTED ON THE COMMUNITY -- THE FACT THAT I HAVE A STAFFER WHO WATCHED OVER AND OVER YOU KNOW WATCHED. THE MASSACRE THAT JUST HAPPENED YOU KNOW -- ACROSS THE OCEAN THAT CAME FROM FACEBOOK IS DEEPLY TROUBLING I MYSELF HAVE SEEN CONTENT POP UP BUT I WILL SAY A LOT LESS LATELY BUT CONTENT THROUGH A FEED. OUR OF EXECUTIONS YOU KNOW -- USED TO HAPPEN A LOT MORE BUT JUST REALLY SHOCKING STUFF AND IT CAN'T JUST BE THE WILD WEST OUT THERE SO. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M I'M SORRY I CAN'T SUPPORT TODAY. YES I HAVE A QUESTION -- OF THE GALLAGHER THE THE WAY THAT THAT I I READ THE SUMMARY OF OF YOUR BILL I WAS DRAFTED BY THE CONSULTANT. ONE OF THE THING THE YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS. IS TO NOT. ALLOW. OF THE SITE LIKE FACEBOOK OR INSTAGRAM. OF FILTER OUT WHAT THEY THINK I WANT TO SEE CHAU SUITS SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF IF I GO ON FACEBOOK AND I DO A LOT OF SEARCHES ON VIDEO ON LIKE THREE FOODS A BARBECUE. AFTER ABOUT A WEEK OR SO. I WAS GONNA START SEEING THAT LOT BECAUSE FACEBOOK. ASSUME THAT THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SEE -- SO YOU WHAT WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS. YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY THAT. HEY FACEBOOK WHICH IS BASED ON CALIFORNIA -- YOU SHOULDN'T BE MANIPULATING CONTENT. OF THE BASE OF THE OVER THE OF SO IT'S AYE AYES WITH THE YOUR YOUR GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT THE SHOULD MANIPULATED BASED PURELY ON THE POLITICAL VIEW POINT. OF YOU KNOW OF THAT CONTENT. RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THERE IS THE END AND I AGREE THEY NEED TO BE MODERATING MORE THIS THE HATE SPEECH THE YOU KNOW THE THE VIOLENT. HARASSMENT YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING ON WHICH THAT'S ALL ABOUT BUT I'D I THINK MISTER NAZARIAN MADE A GREAT POINT WHICH THIS HAPPENED. TO THIS HAPPENED TO A POLITICAL CANDIDATE -- IN THIS LAST ELECTION WHO HIGHLIGHTED IN ONE OF HER ADDS -- YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT HER FAMILY HAD ESCAPED VIETNAM. AND AND THE COMMUTER ROUGE AND SHE AND SHE TALKED ABOUT. THAT EXPERIENCE AND WHAT AND WHAT TRUTHFULLY. OCCURRED THERE AND NOW AND THAT AD WAS BLOCKED -- BY FACEBOOK SO VERY SOON I MEAN THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY IS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS TRYING TO GET AT THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY BLOCK SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE. THAT CONTENT THAT IS BEING BROUGHT FORTH WITH IT. RIGHT -- NOW YOU KNOW LOOK THERE YOU KNOW MAYBE I'LL JUST USE THIS AS MY CLOTHES IF AND LOSSES OTHER QUESTIONS BUT HE HAS BECAUSE I DON'T AND I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE OTHER BILLS BUT YOU KNOW -- I AM TRYING TO GET AT THAT PLACE AND RIGHT NOW MY VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; MY VEHICLE IS IS -- AS&lt;/c&gt; FAR AS I KNOW THE ONLY -- ONE IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM I'M VERY OPEN TO MAKING THESE KIND OF CHANGES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAYBE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IS ON ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- COVERING YOU KNOW THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP -- BUT WE NEED TO DO IT I THINK EVERYBODY IN HERE AGREES WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. TO ADDRESS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH IN THIS VERY REAL PROBLEM THAT IS GOING ON ON ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS -- AND IF WE START GETTING THE PLACE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BLOCK THINGS REALLY BASED ON POLITICAL CONTENT I JUST ASK YOU. PUT YOURSELF IN THAT POSITION YOU KNOW WE ALLHAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS IF YOU POSTED SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU. ABOUT A POLITICAL ISSUE AND FOR WHATEVER REASON FACEBOOK OR TWITTER DECIDED WEBELIEVE THAT THAT. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEET OUR STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. AND YOU HAVE NO RECOURSE YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO RECOURSE NOW TO GO -- AND SAY NO HATE EACH WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS IS NOT PERMISSIBLE THIS IS YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T MAKE WERE IF WE'RE GONNA SAY NO HEY THEIR PRIVATE COMPANY AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS. I THINK WE'VE GOT A REAL PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS -- ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING HOW INFLUENTIAL -- THESE PLATFORMS ARE AND AND AND HOW MUCH THEY REALLY BECOME A PART OF OUR CIVIL DISCOURSE -- IN RECENT YEARS. SO I THOUGHT HEY WORK WITH ME AND AND I'M NOT GONNA. I'M NOT GONNA STEAM ALL THIS THING THROUGH -- YOU KNOW THAT I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME LANGUAGE HELPS MAKE PEOPLE MORE ACCOUNTABLE MAKES IT MORE. COMPREHENSIVE -- YOU KNOW BUT AS I SAID I THINK I'M THE ONLY VEHICLE TRYING TO DO SOME LET'S TRY AND KEEP THIS MOVING FORWARD SO WE CAN DO THAT. THREE AND ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT.
