00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:01.107
ANALYSIS SO THIS IS THE TYPE OF

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.010
ANALYSIS THAT THINK CAL THAT

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.078
DOES -- THEY ARE EXTREMELY

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:09.415

LATER ON WITHIN A FEW YEARS

00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:21.794
AFTER THAT ON AN ALTERNATE SITE

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.829
WAS DETERMINED A SITE THAT WE

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.298
SHOULD LOOK INTO AND THAT WAS

00:09:25.364 --> 00:09:27.500
ACTUALLY. FOR A LACK OF A FORMAL

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.335
NAME CALLED THE STRAWBERRY FIELD

00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:31.103

THAT SO AS A WILLING LET THIS ON

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.714
MY PART AS THE AUTHOR.

00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:43.015
WHEN THERE WAS ANOTHER SITE THAT

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.418
WAS BROUGHT FORWARD WE ALSO MOVE

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.420
TOWARDS THAT SITE WARNING TO DO

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.555

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.264
WE MOVE TOWARDS LOOKING AT THAT

HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE

00:10:08.474 --> 00:10:10.242
FIRST ANALYSIS SO YOU CAN SEE

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.777
THIS KING START TO GET TRICKY IF

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:12.478
YOU'RE NOT.

00:10:12.545 --> 00:10:15.247
REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT WATCHING.

00:10:15.314 --> 00:10:17.083
HOW THIS MOVE FORWARD A LOCAL

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.988
REFERENDUM WHICH ARGUED AGAINST

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.723
THE STRAWBERRY SITE?

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:25.858
AND WAS ARGUING TO LOOK BACK AT

00:10:25.925 --> 00:10:28.394
THE ORIGINALSITE WAS SUCCESSFUL

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.463
THIS ACTION STOPPED THE LAND

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.330
SWAP.

00:10:31.397 --> 00:10:33.165
THE LAND SWAP TO THE STRAWBERRY

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:34.533
SITE.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.369
AND PLACED IT BACK AT THE

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:37.837
ORIGINAL SITE.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:40.873
MANY VOTERS BELIEVED THAT'S WHAT

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.575
THE REFERENDUM DID THE

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:44.477
REFERENDUM ACTUALLY DID NOT

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.846
PLACE IT BACK ACT THE ARTIST

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.981
SITE THAT'S WHAT OUR LEGISLATION

00:10:49.048 --> 00:10:51.217
INTENDS TO DO -- SO THERE HAS

00:10:51.283 --> 00:10:54.687
BEEN LOTS OF NEWS ARTICLES MANY

00:10:54.754 --> 00:10:57.890
PIECES OF OPINION A LOT OF BACK

00:10:57.957 --> 00:10:59.592
AND FORTH THING BUT WHAT I WOULD

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:01.193
SAY TO EVERYBODY HERE.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.863
IS.

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:04.930
WE WANT A CEMETERY.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.733
I THINK THERE'S A 100% AGREEMENT

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.936
THAT NOT ONLY DOES THE VETERANS

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:14.273

PEOPLE IN IRVINE WANNA CEMETERY

00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:19.011
THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN WHERE SO

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:20.446
THERE HAS BEEN THE FIRST SITE

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:21.447
ARTIST SITE.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.948
THE SECOND SIDE THE STRAWBERRY

00:11:23.015 --> 00:11:25.785
SITE AND NOW A THIRD SITE THE

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.752
GOAL SITE.

NOW JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.423
GOAL SITE IS ACTUALLY NOT A GULF

00:11:30.489 --> 00:11:31.724
SITE SO IN MY MIND WHEN YOU SAY

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.059
GOLF YOU'RE GONNA THINK OF

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.194

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.398
AND IT SAYS ON THERE THEY'RE

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:33.599
STILL THERE SO THAT'S OTHER THAN

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:34.733
THAT IT'S ALREADY PRETTY

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.069
RELEVANT AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND

MAKING SO YOU'RE ALREADY ON

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.418
SECOND BASE WITH NO OUTS ON THE

00:15:52.484 --> 00:15:53.719
SITE.

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.654
IT'S READY TO GO IN MY

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:57.423
PROFESSIONAL OPINION CAN BE.

00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:59.758
DEMOLISHED CLEARED BUILT AND

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.860
DELIVERED IN TWO YEARS.

00:16:01.927 --> 00:16:05.397
TAKE IT TO THE BANK TWO YEARS.

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:07.399
ALSO THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.001
THING CERTAINLY TO ME HOPEFULLY

00:16:09.068 --> 00:16:11.203
DO YOU ITS ASPIRATIONAL BUT THIS

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.705
IS THE ACTUAL ORIGINAL FLIGHT

00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:15.641
LINE. NINETEEN FORTY THREE IT

00:16:15.708 --> 00:16:18.010
WAS BUILT AT THE AIR BASE IT'S

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:18.877
STILL THERE.

00:16:18.944 --> 00:16:19.611
THE HANGERS ARE THERE ON THE

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.980
CONTROL TOWER WE LOVE TO SAVE

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:22.348
THAT.

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.383
AND MAKE IT A PART OF THIS

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.518
VETERANS CEMETERY ON MEMORIAL

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:27.019
PARK.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:29.555
THIS THAT MAKES THIS SITE UNIQUE

00:16:29.621 --> 00:16:31.256
THERE ARE NO OTHER SITES THAT

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.258
HAVE THAT.

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.394
IN IN IN A CAN'T BE REPLICATED.

00:16:35.461 --> 00:16:37.062
SO WHY NOT TRY TO SAVE IT AND

00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.498
MAKE IT OF A LEGACY OF THE MEN

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.933
WOMEN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OF

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:43.502
THEM THE WENT THROUGH THERE MANY

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:44.136
OF THEM WHO LOST THEIR LIVES IN

00:16:44.203 --> 00:16:44.770
THE WAR.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:45.938
THERE'S BEEN SOME QUESTIONS

00:16:46.004 --> 00:16:47.773
ABOUT CONTAMINATION I WAS

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.774
INTRODUCED.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.243
HAVING WORKED ON THIS PROPERTY

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:51.877
FOR TEN YEARS I KNOW WE'RE ALL

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.345
THE SITES OF THE CONTAMINATION

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:54.179
ARE.

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:55.481
I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM WE

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.815
HAVE MAPS OF THEM.

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:57.883
WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THEM THEY'RE

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.252
NOT THAT BIG A DEAL FRANKLY.

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.554
BUT WE CAN SET ASIDE SOME MODEST

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:04.089
CONTINGENCY BUDGETS FOR ANY

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.657
CONTAMINATION SAY THEY CAN BE

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:06.992
ACCOMMODATED IN PLACE THEY CAN

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.728
BE ENCAPSULATED OR YOU CAN JUST

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.630
SIMPLY REMOVE THEM [inaudible]

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:12.598
FINALLY.

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:15.167
THIS SITE IS HAS A GREAT SHAPE

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:17.669
TO IT IT CAN BE FULLY UTILIZE

00:17:17.736 --> 00:17:19.071
FOR SIXTY THOUSAND GREAT SITES.

00:17:19.138 --> 00:17:20.305
IT'S GOT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ITS

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:21.940
FRONT DOOR.

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:23.442
AND THERE'S NO HABITAT ON THE

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.444
SITE AND THE SEEK WERE APPROVALS

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:26.745
ARE IN PLACE.

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.881
SO TO ME THIS IS JUST A NO

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.716
BRAINER FOR PLAY.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:32.418
BUT LET'S GO ON TO THE OTHER

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:35.354
SIDE -- THE THE IRREGULAR SHAPE

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.723
OF WHAT'S CALLED THE GOLF COURSE

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.991
SITE SHOULD JUST IMMEDIATELY

00:17:39.057 --> 00:17:41.260
STIFFENED YOU UP JUST LOOK AT

00:17:41.326 --> 00:17:42.461
THE PICTURE OF THE SHAPE OF IT.

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:44.096
IMAGINE TRYING TO DEVELOP

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.964
ANYTHING ON IT.

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:47.499
IT'S IT'S A PROBLEM IT'S GOT

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:50.202
LONG NARROW LEGS.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:51.470
IT'S GOT A FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOOT.

00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:54.206
PERFECT CIRCLE RADIUS SENATE

00:17:54.273 --> 00:17:56.341
THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE.

00:17:56.408 --> 00:17:57.743
TO MANAGE EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:59.244
TO BE DONE CONCENTRICALLY WITH

00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:00.646
THIS CURVE SO RIGHT AWAY THAT

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:02.781
THAT IS A BIG MINUS FOR THAT

00:18:02.848 --> 00:18:03.782
SITE.

00:18:03.849 --> 00:18:05.517
SECONDLY THE FAA ANTENNA STILL

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:08.287
THEIR OPERATING HAS A FIFTEEN

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:09.388
HUNDRED FOOT RADIUS AROUND IT OF

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:10.923
A DEAD ZONE IT'LL ALWAYS BE A

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:13.125
DAD'S ON IT'LL BE WEEDS FOR EVER.

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.626
THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT FROM

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:15.994
THAT SITE.

00:18:16.061 --> 00:18:18.297
THIRD THE ACCESS TO THAT SITE IS

00:18:18.363 --> 00:18:20.265
A LITTLE BIT LESS ATTRACTIVE

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:22.134
THAN TO THE ARTIST SITE BECAUSE

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:23.669
IT'S SHARED.

00:18:23.735 --> 00:18:24.703
IT'S CALL BOSQUE DRIVE AND KATE

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.506
INSTRUMENT SHARED BY THE

00:18:27.573 --> 00:18:28.106
RESIDENCES ARE ALREADY LIVING

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:29.675
THERE.

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:31.310
SO -- OOPS.

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:32.211
HAVE PEOPLE COMING AND GOING TO

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:32.711
THE MEMORIAL PARK IN THE

00:18:32.778 --> 00:18:33.946
CEMETERY.

00:18:34.012 --> 00:18:35.214
SOME TURN LEFT INTO THEIR

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.915
DRIVEWAY SOME TURN RIGHT INTO

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:38.917
THE CEMETERY NOT SO GOOD.

00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:40.419
WHEREAS THE ARTIST SITE HAS IT --

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.521
SON WAY WHICH IS A COLLECTOR

00:18:42.588 --> 00:18:43.722
THERE'S NO HOUSES ON GO STRAIGHT

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.691
IN.

00:18:45.757 --> 00:18:47.159
AND FINALLY -- IF YOU GO TO THE

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.027

COURSE SITE OVER THE A. R. D. A

00:25:23.755 --> 00:25:26.157
SITE AS THE SUPERIOR LOCATION

00:25:26.224 --> 00:25:28.627
FOR A NEW CEMETERY.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:29.294
I'M A BRIEFLY WALK THROUGH JUST

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:29.928
A COUPLE OF FACTS AS TO WHY WE

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:31.730
BELIEVE THE COMMISSION'S ARRIVED

00:25:31.796 --> 00:25:33.498
AT THIS CONCLUSION SO QUICKLY.

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:35.901
FIRST AND FOREMOST -- WE LEAVE

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.335
THE ARE THEY ALREADY A SITE IS

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:38.703
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.771
BASED ON THE OWN REPORT

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:41.539
COMMISSIONED BY CAL THAT THE

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:44.109
COST FOR THE A. R. D. A SITE IS

00:25:44.175 --> 00:25:45.443
NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.144
USING THAT SAME METHODOLOGY

00:25:46.211 --> 00:25:47.812
STAFFS ESTIMATE FOR THE COST TO

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.447
CONSTRUCT THE GOLF COURSE SITE

00:25:49.514 --> 00:25:51.082
IS FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:52.684
THE REASON FOR THE COST

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.685
DIFFERENTIAL IS FAIRLY CLEAR.

00:25:53.752 --> 00:25:55.387
THE GOLF COURSE SITE HAS BEEN

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:57.055
CLEARED OF ALL INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:57.756
ON TRADE WHAT YOU HEARD

00:25:57.822 --> 00:26:00.392
PREVIOUSLY ALL CONCRETE RUNWAY

BUILDINGS TAXI WAYS -- WAS

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.662
SIGNIFICANTLY MEET REMEDIATION

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.363
OF THE SOIL IN PLACE.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.565
THE A. ALREADY A SITE HAS OVER

00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:08.133
SEVENTY FIVE BUILDING STILL

00:26:08.199 --> 00:26:09.034
STANDING ON SITE.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.468
EXTENSIVE UNDERGROUND UTILITY

00:26:10.535 --> 00:26:13.071
INFRASTRUCTURE RUNWAY TAXI WAYS

00:26:13.138 --> 00:26:14.272
AND THE ASSOCIATED.

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:15.840
KNOWN AND IMPORTANTLY UNKNOWN

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:18.143
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ON THAT

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:20.412
SITE -- WITHIN LAST WEEK FIVE

00:26:20.478 --> 00:26:21.546
POINT COMMUNITIES HAS COMMITTED

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.114
TO CONTRIBUTING AN ADDITIONAL

00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:24.950
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:26:25.016 --> 00:26:25.550
CEMETERY CONSTRUCTION ON THE

00:26:25.617 --> 00:26:26.017
SITE.

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.152
IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:28.186
BELIEVE IT'S THIRTY MILLION

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.688
DOLLARS LESS EXPENSIVE TO START

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:30.889
WITH SO.

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:31.523
FIRST POINT BEING THE

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.124
SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS WE

00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:34.559
BELIEVE TO BE THERE FOR THE GOLF

00:26:34.626 --> 00:26:35.694
COURSE SITE.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.362
A SECOND HAS TO DO WITH TIMELY

00:26:37.429 --> 00:26:38.530
AS WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:40.098
THE GOLF COURSE SITE AGAIN

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:41.266
BECAUSE IT MUCH OF THE

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:42.534
REMEDIATION IS ALREADY BEING

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.802
COMPLETE CAN BE CONCLUDED MORE

00:26:43.868 --> 00:26:45.437
QUICKLY.

00:26:45.503 --> 00:26:46.771
DEMOLITION REMEDIATION HAS BEEN

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:48.206
CALLED COMPLETED FOR THE GOLF

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:51.509
COURSE SITE I THIS IS YET TO BE

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:52.344
UNDERTAKEN FOR THE A. R. D. A

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:52.711
SITE.

00:26:52.777 --> 00:26:53.311
I IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT

00:26:53.378 --> 00:26:55.914
CONCEPT PLAN HAS INDEED BEEN

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:56.881
PREPARED FOR THE A. R. D. A SITE

00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:58.249
WE ESTIMATE THE GOLF COURSE SAY

00:26:58.316 --> 00:26:59.784
CAN BE COMPLETED.

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:01.219
APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS SOONER

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.354
GIVEN ALL HE DEMOLITION

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.855
REMEDIATION IT'S ALREADY TAKEN

00:27:03.922 --> 00:27:04.923
PLACE.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.124
I WITH THAT JUST A COUPLE OF

00:27:06.191 --> 00:27:07.959
OTHER CONCERNS I WANNA I WANNA

00:27:08.026 --> 00:27:10.261
RAISE -- FIRST BEING -- IT'S

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:11.796
BEEN SUGGESTED THAT SOME OF THE

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:13.398
BUILDING STILL STANDING ON THE

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.700
A. R. D. A. SITE MAYBE HISTORIC.

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:17.068
ACCORDING TO THE VA ALL HISTORIC

00:27:17.135 --> 00:27:18.203
STUDIES WOULD NEED TO BE

00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:19.838
COMPLETED BEFORE THE FEDERAL

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:20.638
GOVERNMENT WILL REIMBURSE THE

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.439
STATE.

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:22.841
A FURTHER AND AGAIN ACCORDING TO

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:24.009
WHAT WE HEARD JUST THIS WEEK

00:27:24.075 --> 00:27:25.010
FROM THE VA.

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:26.044
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NOT

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:28.213
REIMBURSE THE STATE UNTIL THE

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:29.447
ENTIRE SITE IS REMEDIATED

00:27:29.514 --> 00:27:31.249
MEETING A PHASED APPROACH THAT

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:31.883
WOULD LEAVE THOSE BUILDINGS IN

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.654
PLACE -- WOULD LIKELY NOT BE

00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.256
FEASIBLE.

00:27:38.323 --> 00:27:40.025
SECOND POINT -- A. R. D. A SITE

00:27:40.091 --> 00:27:41.726
IS BISECTED BY PRIMARY ROADWAY --

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.427
ALTHOUGH NOT A DISQUALIFIER

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.028
ACCORDING TO THE VA THEY DO

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:44.529
SPECIFICALLY LISTA PREFERENCE

00:27:44.596 --> 00:27:45.897
FOR UNIFORMS SITES.

00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.432
UNDIVIDED BY ROADWAYS ARE

00:27:47.499 --> 00:27:48.299
EASEMENTS.

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:49.968
GOLF COURSE SITE HAS NO SUCH

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:50.935
ENCUMBRANCES.

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.704
OUR UNDERSTANDING THE FEDERAL

00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:54.739
GRANT PROCESS IS THAT IT IS VERY

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:56.241
CAN.

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.375
AND AGAIN WHILE A SITE BEING

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:59.244
DIVIDED BY ROADWAYS NOT

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.179
NECESSARILY DISQUALIFIER -- WE

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:02.180
BELIEVE THE DIVIDED NATURE OF

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:03.548
THE A OR D. A SITE WOULD BE

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:04.916
INFERIOR TO THE CONTIGUOUS

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:06.885
UNIFORM SHAPE OF THE GOLF COURSE

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:08.453
SITE.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.621
AND ONE LAST POINT -- THE RT

00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:11.289
SITE HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO

00:28:11.356 --> 00:28:13.691
OPPOSITION THE COMMUNITY.

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:14.592
THE A SIDE ACROSS THE STREET

00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:16.094
FROM A CASE RIGHT SCHOOL.

00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:16.628
YOUR MIND UNIFIED SCHOOL

00:28:16.694 --> 00:28:18.329

DURING SCHOOL HOURS.

00:28:27.872 --> 00:28:28.873
THE GOLF COURSE SITE HAS HAD NO

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.775
SUCH OPPOSITION AND DOES NOT

00:28:30.842 --> 00:28:33.111
HAVE THE SENSITIVITY SINCE HE'S

00:28:33.178 --> 00:28:34.679
THE SCHOOLS ARE RESIDENTS.

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.448
IN SUMMARY I WE ESTIMATE THAT

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.449
THE ATA SITE IS SOME THIRTY

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:38.950
MILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:39.984

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:41.953
THIS COUPLED WITH THE OFFER OF

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.520
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS

00:28:42.587 --> 00:28:44.122
RENDERS THE SITE NEARLY SIXTY

MILLION DOLLARS MORE EXPENSIVE

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:48.393
THAN THE GOLF COURSE I FURTHER

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.561
THE AIR DECIDE AS POTENTIAL

00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:50.295
STORE CALLED DESIGNATION.

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:51.696
DIVIDED PSYCH COMPLICATIONS

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:53.698
MAKING IT LESS COMPETITIVE FOR

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:54.766
FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT.

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.134
WELL THE GOLF COURSE SITE FALLS

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:56.801
SQUARELY WITHIN FEDERAL

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.970

00:33:20.331 --> 00:33:21.432
THAT RUNS RIGHT THROUGH IT.

00:33:21.499 --> 00:33:23.234
THIS ROAD WILL WILL RUN THROUGH

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:25.103
VETERANS CEMETERY.

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:28.439
FROM RESIDENCES TO HIGH SCHOOL.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:29.841
I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE INTERRED

00:33:29.907 --> 00:33:30.742
NEXT TO THAT WROTE [inaudible]

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:34.679

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:35.913
IT ALSO HAS WHAT WAS OMITTED

FROM THE STONE WAS REPORT.

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:40.284

TALL ANTENNAS THAT STANDS NEXT

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:43.354
TO THE OLD TOWER.

00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.989
EVEN IF YOU TO MOSTLY OLD TOWER

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:47.692
THAT IN TERNARY WOULD STAND.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.627
WE FEEL THAT THE OUR SITE IS

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:52.163
OVERLY EXPENSIVE.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.266

SAVINGS ARE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:07.211
DOLLARS THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE

00:34:07.278 --> 00:34:08.379
TO SPEND ON A VETERANS CEMETERY

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:10.014
OVER THE COURSE OF TIME.

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:11.749
WE WOULD PREFER THAT YOU TAKE

AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEEDS OF A

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:17.088

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:52.824
ADDRESSED.

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:54.525

WILL BE UPSETTING TO THE SCHOOL

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:12.276
DAY AND AND ALSO THE POSSIBILITY

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:15.613
OF DESENSITIZING THE COMMUNITY

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.849
SHOULD THERE ACTUALLY BE.

NECESSARILY A PROBLEM IN

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.060
ADDRESSING THIS WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:31.596

QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:04.996

IN SCHEDULED FOR DECOMMISSIONING

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.861
BY THE FAA I TRIED DESPERATELY

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:39.630
TO GET THEM TO DO THAT BECAUSE

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:42.099
IT'S OUR TECHNOLOGY AS YOU ALL

00:36:42.166 --> 00:36:43.200
KNOW.

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:43.768
YES.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.570
PLEASE PICK UP SORRY I GPS IS

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:46.370
OBVIATED.

00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:47.905
THERE'S A LIST YES AND IT O THE

00:36:47.972 --> 00:36:49.674
LIST ON IT LAST I CHECKED YEARS

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.643
AGO IT WAS WAY DOWN THE LIST.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.011
SO DONALD IT'S ON A DE

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:59.383
COMMISSIONING LAST SUNDAY YES

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.252
OKAY WHICH WE DON'T KNOW WHEN.

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:03.154
NOT FOR A LONG TIME WELL I DON'T

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:04.689
KNOW NEXT GEN.

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:06.057
GETTING A PILOT DIRECTION MOVES

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:07.925
ALONG SO.

00:37:07.992 --> 00:37:08.559
BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:09.594
TO BE STUDIED CORRECT.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.194
YES IT WOULD BE WORTH LOOKING

00:37:10.261 --> 00:37:11.162
INTO.

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.597
SO LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:14.599
DOES THIS I GUESS OF THE AUTHOR

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.900
DOES THIS BILL TAKE ANY

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.034
AUTHORITY.

00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:19.036
AWAY FROM THE CITY OF IRVINE TO

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.238
MAKE THE LAND USE TERMINATION

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:23.741
THIS CASE AND THAT IS.

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.409
TO THE SITE THE CEMETERY.

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:27.144
AT THE ARTIST SITE OR DECIDED AT

00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.879
THE GOLF COURSE SIDE OR FRANKLY

00:37:28.946 --> 00:37:31.949
DECIDED SOMEWHERE ELSE WITHIN

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:35.920
THE CITY LIMITS -- AS WAS NOTED --

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.421
THE COUNCIL WILL BE BRINGING IT

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:39.857
UP FOR A VOTE THEY MAY AGREE

00:37:39.924 --> 00:37:42.326
WITH THE ART A OR THEY MAY.

00:37:42.393 --> 00:37:45.630
DISAGREE OR HAVE ALTERNATIVE --

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:46.664
MOTIONS.

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:49.567
SO IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY IF THEY

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:53.104
CHOOSE SAY JUST SAY WE MOVE

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:54.338
FORWARD WITH THE ARTIST SITE AND

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.439
THEY BRING IT UP TO THEIR

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:56.540
COUNSEL.

00:37:56.607 --> 00:37:58.376
BUT DO NOT WANT THE ARTIST SITE

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.311
THEY THEY LIST THE GOLF SITE

00:38:00.378 --> 00:38:03.714
THEN OBVIOUSLY WE WOULD HAVE --

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.616
CONFLICTING.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:08.052
WITH THE STATE NAME IN ONE THE

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:10.621
THE COUNCIL NAMING ANOTHER -- IT

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.990
DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE WOULD HAVE

00:38:13.057 --> 00:38:15.660
A MANDATE OVER THEM OR YOU WANT

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:17.561
TO SAY A FRIENDS OVER THEM BUT

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.397
THERE WOULD BE.

00:38:19.463 --> 00:38:23.234
A CONFLICT TO TO RESULT. TO THE

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.369
CITY COUNCIL RETAINS ITS.

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.504
WHEN USE OF THIRTY IN THIS

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:30.341
PARTICULAR CASE TO DECIDE WHERE?

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.410
TO PUT THE CEMETERY OR NOT PUT

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.478
IT AT ALL CORRECT RIGHT.

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:35.913
BUT SO SO LET ME JUST BACK UP

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.248
WITH EXAMPLE FROM LAST TIME SO

00:38:37.314 --> 00:38:41.252
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY SAID THE ARDA

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.453
THAT THERE'S WAS AGREEMENT AT

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.388
THAT TIME.

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.090
THEN LATER ON THEN THE

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:49.126
STRAWBERRY FILLED WAS DECIDED

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:51.462
BECAUSE WE MOVE FORWARD WE

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.130
DIDN'T HAVE A CONFLICT BETWEEN

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:55.533
SITE AND BETWEEN COUNSEL AND

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.467
STATE.

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:59.403
BUT HAD WE HAD A CONFLICT LIKE

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:00.838
POSSIBLY NOW.

00:39:00.905 --> 00:39:03.074
THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE TRYING TO

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.309
RESOLVE THAT BECAUSE LIKE I SAID

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:06.544
IN THE BEGINNING.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:11.549
MY INTENT IS NOT TO OF TO MOVE

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:14.485
FORWARD UP AT ANY POINT ONE OF

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.786
THE REASONS THAT WE MOVED

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:16.954
FORWARD.

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.756
REGARDING NAMING A SITE THIS

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:20.558
TIME WE FELT LIKE WE'VE BEEN

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.493
WORKING AT THIS NOW FOR SIX

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.394
YEARS.

00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:25.496
AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A RESOLUTION

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:27.098
THERE'S GOT TO BE A POINT WHERE.

00:39:27.164 --> 00:39:29.934
WE EITHER MOVE FORWARD IN THIS

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.037
HAPPENS OR IT DOESN'T AND SO THE

00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:34.939
RESULT COULD VERY WELL BE THAT

00:39:35.005 --> 00:39:37.141
THE COUNCIL DOESN'T AGREE WITH

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:41.078
THIS -- THIS SITE AND THEN AND

00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.613
THEN AT THAT POINT WE HAVE A

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.382
CONFLICT AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.251
TO MOVE COMPLETELY FORWARD BUT

00:39:47.318 --> 00:39:49.186
THE STATE DOESNT OVERRIDE THE

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:50.354
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.622
AS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN INVOLVED

00:39:51.689 --> 00:39:55.626
IN THIS ISSUE SINCE. TWO

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:56.494
THOUSAND THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.795
HIS INITIAL MONEY CAME THROUGH

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.163
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NEVER FOR

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.698
WHICH I CHAIRED.

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:02.399
I THINK I VOTED ON THAT I VOTED

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:04.802
ON THE ONE BEFORE YOU HAVE YOU

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.837
HAVE VOTED ON Q. ANY MILLION SO.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:08.172
I'M CERTAINLY INVEST.

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.907
IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:12.610
VETERANS CEMETERY SOMEWHERE --

00:40:12.676 --> 00:40:14.678
IN ORANGE COUNTY.

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.714
I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE WE'RE

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.349
NOT TAKING AWAY THE LOCAL

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:20.284
JURISDICTIONS ABILITY TO MAKE A

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:21.819
LAND USE DECISION.

00:40:21.886 --> 00:40:24.388
BUT INSTEAD ARE AUTHORIZING --

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:27.658
CALVET DECIDED CEMETERY AT SOME

00:40:27.725 --> 00:40:29.460
PLACE IN ORANGE COUNTY.

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.362
WHY DON'T WE DESIGNATE THOSE

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.997
SITES THE GOLF COURSE SITE?

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:35.132
AND THIS ARTIST SIDE AND LEFT

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:36.167
THE CITY COUNCIL.

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.668
MAKE DECISIONS THAT THE CITY

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:39.603
COUNCIL IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE.

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.905
BECAUSE LAST TIME I CHECKED

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:42.807
WE'RE NOT A CITY COUNCIL.

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.275
AND I THINK RIGHT EXACTLY AND I

00:40:44.341 --> 00:40:46.210
AND I CAN HEAR YOUR DISCUSSION

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:48.412
ON THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:49.613
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.715
WE'RE SERIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT

00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:53.784
THE GULF SITE EVEN TWO WEEKS AGO

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:56.187
WE WERE NOT WAS THIS ALL OF THIS

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:58.422
NEW INFORMATION THAT NOW THERE

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:02.159
IS A A RENEWED PREFERENCE IF IT.

00:41:02.226 --> 00:41:05.796
THAT NAMES THE GOLF SITE OR EVEN

00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:06.897
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION JUST CAME

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:08.999
UP IN THE LAST IF YOU WANT TO

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:11.402
CALL IT WEEK OR TWENTY FOURTH

00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.937
OUR IS ANOTHER WAY TO SAY IT.

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:15.739
WE PUT THIS LANGUAGE FORWARD

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.107
ALMOST THREE MONTHS AGO THERE

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:20.010
WAS MANY MANY TIMES THAT ON NOT

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:22.413
ONLY THE CITY BUT THE DEVELOPER

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:24.081
THEMSELVES AND THE VETERANS

00:41:24.148 --> 00:41:25.616
GROUP COULD HAVE CALLED MY

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:27.585
OFFICE AND SAID LET'S SIT DOWN.

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:29.253
AND DISCUSS IT NOT ONCE HAVE WE

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.055
HAD THOSE REQUESTS SO IT IS

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:32.723
REALLY THERE IS A TRUST ISSUE

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.091
HERE WHEN WE'VE BEEN MOVING

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:34.859
FORWARD.

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:37.294
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN NOW I

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:38.796
MEAN EVEN LAST WEEK THERE WERE

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:44.134
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WELL WOULD

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:45.035
WOULD WE JUST LOOK AT POSSIBLY A

00:41:45.102 --> 00:41:45.703
HUNDRED ACRES BECAUSE THAT'S ALL

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.238
WE HAVE TO HAVE WE DON'T HAVE TO

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:49.273
HAVE THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.274
ACRES.

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.809
OF THE ARTIST SITE -- WOULD WE

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:54.044
JUST CONSIDER THAT AND I'VE SAID

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.446
IN THE VERY BEGINNING AND I'M

00:41:55.512 --> 00:41:57.047
HAPPY TO ALWAYS CONVERSE HAPPY

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:59.350
TO SIT DOWN AND WORK THINGS OUT

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.417
AND I WOULD BE.

00:42:00.484 --> 00:42:02.586
AGAIN EVEN AFTER VOTE HAPPY TO

00:42:02.653 --> 00:42:05.189
DO THAT WHAT IT TAKES.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.724
TO OR THREE OR FOUR TO HAVE A

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.226
CONVERSATION AND SO WHEN YOU GET

00:42:09.293 --> 00:42:11.161
SOME OF THIS INFORMATION COMING

00:42:11.228 --> 00:42:12.830
AT THE LAST MINUTE LIKE THIS

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:15.833
MAKES IT HARD TO TO REALLY.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.969
FEEL THAT THIS IS A SINCERE.

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:20.704
BUT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOTION.

00:42:20.771 --> 00:42:21.906
SOME MOTION LANGUAGE THAT WAS

00:42:21.972 --> 00:42:23.140
FLOATING AROUND AND YOU KNOW HOW

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:24.909
I FEEL ABOUT DOING MOTIONS AND

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:26.877
COMMITTEE BUT THERE WAS A MOTION

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.612
LANGUAGE FLOATING AROUND TO

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:31.048
AUTHORIZE THE CALVET THE SITE

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.483
THE CEMETERY.

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.151
AT THE OPTION OF THE CITY OF

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:35.319
IRVINE.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:37.121
AND I DO THE GOLF COURSE SITE

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:39.890
WHERE THE ARTIST SITE AND WHAT

00:42:39.957 --> 00:42:40.457
WHAT IT WAS THAT WITH THAT

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.992
MOTION LANGUAGE BE ACCEPTABLE TO

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:43.661
YOU ASSUMING THAT I HAVE NOT

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.763
BEEN PRESENTED AS THE AUTHOR

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:47.498
WITH THIS BILL WITH ANY OF THAT.

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.967
I'VE I'VE SEEN A LETTER THAT THE

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:52.436
CITY SAID I THINK TO THE SENATOR

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.737
NEVER SENT TO ME.

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:54.805
THAT SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:57.408
HIGHLY IRREGULAR I ALSO THINK

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:59.276
WITH HIGHLY IRREGULAR.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:01.345
IS THAT A CITY ALONG WITH THE

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:04.214
DEVELOPER WOULD SET SENT A SIGN

00:43:04.281 --> 00:43:06.383
A JOINT LETTER TOGETHER -- I WAS

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.852
ON COUNCIL FULLERTON CITY

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:09.987
COUNCIL.

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:11.722
FOR EIGHT BEFORE WHERE YOU HAVE

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:15.426
A CITY AND A DEVELOPER IN

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:16.460
ESSENCE Là BILLY OFF LOBBYING

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:18.696
JOINTLY TOGETHER ON CITY LETTER

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:19.697
HEAD.

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:22.599
VERY IRREGULAR SO THESE MAKE ME

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:25.436
WANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD

00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.271
AS THE BILL IS PRESENTED AND

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:29.440
THEN PUT THE TIME ON THE TABLE

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:30.975
TO REALLY LOOK AND SIT DOWN AND

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.710
MEET I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:34.111
AND MEET WITH FIVE POINT.

00:43:34.178 --> 00:43:35.512
I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.881
MEET WITH THE CITY AND EVEN SOME

00:43:37.948 --> 00:43:39.283
OF THERE ARE SOME -- COUNCIL

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:42.119
MEMBERS I MEAN I HAVE MANY MANY

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.687
TIMES DONE THAT BEFORE AND WE

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:47.291
COME TO A VERY SINCERE SOLUTION

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.425
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE TO THEIR TWO

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:49.560
OPTIONS OF COURSE ONE THIS

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:50.427
COMMITTEE.

00:43:50.494 --> 00:43:51.395
I BELIEVE HAS ONE MORE

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:55.766
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET BEFORE WE GO

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:56.600
HONOR INTERIM STUDY SESSION

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:57.401
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IT

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.736
COULD BE A TO YOUR BILL.

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.971
BUT LET ME MOVE ON AND LET ME

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:05.109
GET TO THE THE REAL ISSUE -- IN

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:07.244
THE DIFFICULT POSITION I THINK

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.380
THAT THIS BILL PUTS US AND THE

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:11.582
SPREADSHEETS THAT I'VE SEEN ON

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:14.752
THE TWO SIDES AND I REALIZE --

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.987
ONE ESTIMATE OF CONSTRUCTION

00:44:17.054 --> 00:44:18.188
FROM CALVET.

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:19.523
MAYBE QUETION BUT IT'S A CALVET

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.458
ESTIMATE.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:22.626
AND THEN THERE'S AN ESTIMATE

00:44:22.693 --> 00:44:23.961
CITY PUT TOGETHER FOR THE GOLF

00:44:24.028 --> 00:44:25.529
COURSE ALTERNATIVE.

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:28.198
AND THE CALVET ARDA TOTALS

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:28.832
NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLARS EVER

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.234
TAKE.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.668
AND THE GOLF COURSE ALTERNATIVE

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:33.804
IF THE CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.472
AND WHO KNOWS BECAUSE PERHAPS IT

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:37.274
SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF THE

00:44:37.341 --> 00:44:37.775
STUDY WE'RE WE ACTUALLY

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:39.043
DETERMINE.

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.010
THE COST OF THESE TWO

00:44:40.077 --> 00:44:42.246
ALTERNATIVES AND SELECT.

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.081
THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SATISFACTORY

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:46.283
SOLUTION RIGHT NOW THIS BILL

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.419
PUTS US IN BUT SOME OF US IN THE

00:44:48.485 --> 00:44:50.187
POSITION WHO SERVE CONSISTENTLY

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.588
ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:52.423
SEVEN YEARS.

00:44:52.489 --> 00:44:54.658
IN THE POSITION OF VOTING FOR

00:44:54.725 --> 00:44:56.226
THE MOST EXPENSIVE. TWO

00:44:56.293 --> 00:44:57.461
ALTERNATIVES.

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:58.796
IF IT'S TRUE IT NINETY ONE

00:44:58.862 --> 00:45:00.197
MILLION DOLLARS AS OPPOSED TO

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.566
STUDYING IT AND TRYING TO

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:04.768
DETERMINE WHETHER IN FACT. TO

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:05.302
FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:06.804
SOLUTION.

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:08.972
IS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY CLOSE TO

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:10.574
THE STATE AND TO THE CITY OF

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:12.910
IRVINE SO YOU SEE THE POSITION

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:15.279
THAT THIS PUTS US AND SOME OF

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:18.282
HIS USER -- BUT WHAT I WOULD ADD

00:45:18.348 --> 00:45:20.951
INTO THAT IS CAL THAT HAS NOT

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:23.320
STUDIED THE SECOND SITE AND THE

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.589
CITY HAS GIVEN INFORMATION ABOUT

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.658
WHAT THEY THINK THE COST IS.

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:30.494
AND WE ALSO HAVE TALK TO TELL

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.563
THAT ABOUT RE LOOKING AT THE

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.298
ARTIST SITE AND THEIR NUMBERS

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:37.034
REGARDING THAT THE COST THAT WAS

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:38.035
GIVEN.

00:45:38.102 --> 00:45:40.471
NUMBER ONE IS IF THE SITE IS

00:45:40.537 --> 00:45:43.740
USED FOR SAY RETAIL OR HOUSING

00:45:43.807 --> 00:45:44.541
THAT.

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:46.477
COULD BE ONE DETERMINATION OF

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:49.613
SITE CLEANUP IF THE SITE IS USED

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.014
FOR BURIAL ARE THOSE SAME

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:54.284
NUMBERS USE SO WE HAVEN'T

00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.053
BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE COULD

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.955
THERE BE AN ADJUSTMENT THERE IF

00:45:58.021 --> 00:46:02.092
YOU'RE USING LAND FOR ONE YEAR

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:03.160
USE VERSUS THE OTHER.

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.194
AND COULD THAT REDUCE THE PRICE

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:06.763
THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE WAS A

00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:09.299
LOT OF THE DEMOLITION COSTS AND

00:46:09.366 --> 00:46:11.201
SO FORTH ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:46:11.268 --> 00:46:13.437
REMOVING CONCRETE AND POSSIBLY

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:16.607
FINDING SOME TYPE OF CONNECT

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:17.774
CONTAMINATION ANOTHER.

00:46:17.841 --> 00:46:18.842
UP.

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.311
TYPE OF SOLUTION COULD BE NOT TO

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:26.383
REMOVE IT AND BRING IN -- DIRT.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.118
PUT OVER THE SITE.

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:29.086
SO THESE ARE SOME WAYS TO LOOK

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:31.321
AT COST SAVINGS THEY'RE NOT A

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.523
100% VETTED THEY'RE JUST

00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:34.491
SOLUTIONS TO LOOK AT LOWERING

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.527
THE COST ONE OTHER OPTION WOULD

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:37.494
BE.

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:39.296
TO SLIGHTLY MODIFY THE BILL TO

00:46:39.363 --> 00:46:41.999
SPECIFY AUTHORIZE CALVET SINCE

00:46:42.065 --> 00:46:43.066
CALVIN IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:46.203
DECIDER THE CITY OF IRVINE IS.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.171
I'M TO GO TO ONE SIDE OR THE

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:48.772
OTHER AND THEN HAVING THE THE

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.340
STATE FUND.

00:46:50.407 --> 00:46:52.109
THE STUDY NECESSARY TO DETERMINE

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:54.678
WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS ARE.

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:56.213
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.781
CALVET STUDY THE FIRST. ONE TO

00:46:57.848 --> 00:46:59.283
DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COSTS

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:01.418
ARE WITH BOTH SIDES WITH THE

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.154
PROS AND THE CONS ARE SO -- NOT

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:05.956
THAT WE MAKE A DECISION -- BUT

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:07.191
THE CITY OF IRVINE WITH MAY BE

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:08.292
ABLE TO MAKE AN INFORMED

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:09.493
DECISION AS TO WHICH SITE IS

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.295
BEST.

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.964
AND YOU'D HAVE YOU KNOW UNTIL

IS THAT RIGHT YES.

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.233
AND THEN THERE WAS A COUPLE

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:50.400
OTHER SITES PROPOSE ONE IN

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:51.802

IS THIS THE OUR SITE STUDY I

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:51.561
BELIEVE JUST BY LOOKING AT

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:52.229
THAT'S THE OWN REPORT

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.864
COMMISSIONED BY CAL THAT LOOKS

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:54.531
LOOKS TO BE OKAY.

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.799
AND IN TERMS OF THE TOXICOLOGY

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.934
OR THE TOXIC STUDY THAT WAS DONE

00:48:58.001 --> 00:48:58.502
ON THE GOLF COURSE I WHO DID

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.304
THAT.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.872
IS THAT IT'S SO FAR BEEN DONE BY

00:49:01.938 --> 00:49:03.273
FIVE POINT IS PART OF THE

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.242
DEVELOPMENT OF THE GREAT PARK SO

00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:06.977
FIVE POINT DID THE STUDY THAT.

00:49:07.044 --> 00:49:09.112
YOU BASE YOUR COST ESTIMATE ON

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.747
IS THAT RIGHT NO I COST ESTIMATE

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.015
IS BASED ON THE INS REPORT.

00:49:12.082 --> 00:49:13.984
ACTIVELY IT WAS AN ADMITTEDLY A

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.552
VERY ROUGH ESTIMATE THAT

00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:17.421
BASICALLY JUST BACKED OUT THE

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.789
PURSE WERE FOOT DEMOLITION OR

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.857
MEDIATION COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH

00:49:20.924 --> 00:49:22.759
OUR TO OFFER THAT NINETY ONE

00:49:22.826 --> 00:49:23.560
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:49:23.627 --> 00:49:25.228
KNOWING IT DIDN'T NEED TO BE

00:49:25.295 --> 00:49:26.129
DONE FOR THE GOLF COURSE THAT'S

00:49:26.196 --> 00:49:27.631
THE ASSUMPTION IT DIDN'T NEED TO

00:49:27.698 --> 00:49:28.965
BE DONE FOR THE GOLF COURSE THAT

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:30.033
CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT AND

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.102
THERE'S BEEN NO OTHER THAN THE

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:33.036
FIVE POINT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:35.439
OTHER NO OTHER ANALYSIS AS TO

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:39.109
THE DEGRADATION.

00:49:39.176 --> 00:49:42.245
OF THE SITE KNOWS THE GOLF

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.347
COURSE LIKE THAT RIGHT WELL

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:44.514
THAT'S A IT'S BEEN THE DIRT HAS

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:45.115
BEEN MOVED SO WE ACTUALLY OF

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:47.217
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AS TO WHAT'S

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:47.884
THERE BECAUSE IT'S ALL IT'S BEEN

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.353
TURNED.

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:51.722
IN SYMPHONY ANALYZE THAT DIRT

00:49:51.788 --> 00:49:52.022
[inaudible]

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:53.590
YES -- THAT DIRT WAS ANALYZED

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:54.558
AND WE HAVE A PROTOCOL FOR

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:55.492
REMOVING TOXIC SUBSTANCES DURING

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:56.960
CONSTRUCTION.

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:58.929
THERE WERE SEVERAL PIPES --

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.364
INSULATED PIPES REMOVED SEVERAL

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:01.832
OTHER REMNANTS REMOVED DURING

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:03.700
THE PROCESS SO WHO DID THAT

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:04.167
STUDY.

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:05.535
ARE THERE WAS A CONSULTANT THAT

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.871
WAS HIRED TO DO THAT DURING THE

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.306
PROCESS I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP

00:50:09.373 --> 00:50:11.074
OF MY HEAD WE GET THAT PLEASE I

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:11.475
CAN PROVIDE THAT.

00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:12.976
TO CERTAINLY SO IN TERMS OF THE

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.878
COST -- YOU HEARD MR FOR SCHOOL

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:16.980
ESTIMATE THE COST TO BE FIFTY

00:50:17.047 --> 00:50:18.615
MILLION DOLLARS -- WITH WITH

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:21.351
CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS DO YOU

00:50:21.418 --> 00:50:22.919
DISAGREE WITH ANYTHING HE SAID.

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:23.553
THE ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW THE A.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.455
R. D. A SITE IS THE NINETY ONE

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:26.823
MILLION FROM THE CAL THAT.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:27.657
ACTUALLY WAS SEVENTY MILLION

00:50:27.724 --> 00:50:29.526
CORRECT IT WAS IN LATER AMENDED

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.661
BY CAL THAT TO NINETY ONE

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.396
BECAUSE OF COSTS PRESS OF

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:37.134
INFLATION WHAT WOULD THE COST BE

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.802
IF WE DIDN'T TAKE UP THE RUNWAY.

00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:39.803
WELL I'D BE MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:40.404
WE'RE ESTIMATING FOR THE GOLF

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:41.071
COURSE I TO BELIEVE IN THE RANGE

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:42.072
OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS SO WE

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.007
DIDN'T REMOVE THE RUNWAY.

00:50:44.074 --> 00:50:45.509
THE SITES WOULD BE.

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:47.577
EVEN COURTING YEAR ESTIMATE

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.012
BASICALLY EQUALS THAT RIGHT.

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:49.913
HARD TO SAY I MEAN THEN YOU'VE

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.248
GOT A COST OF IMPORTING DIRT I

00:50:51.314 --> 00:50:51.915
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST OF THAT

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:54.184
IS BUT YES CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BE

00:50:54.251 --> 00:50:55.051
LESS EXPENSIVE.

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.421
AND AND I ALSO READ -- THAT THE

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.489
GOLF COURSE SITE.

00:50:59.556 --> 00:51:00.490
DEVELOPMENT READY IS THAT

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.225
CORRECT -- YEAH I MEAN DEPENDING

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.059
ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY DEVELOPMENT

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:04.895
READY ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:51:04.961 --> 00:51:06.696
RUNWAYS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.331
HAS BEEN TURNED.

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:10.033
I SEE IN THE IN THE DOCUMENT

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:11.668
THAT I SHOWED YOU AWHILE AGO THE

00:51:11.735 --> 00:51:13.503
REQUEST THAT THIS IS THE IRVINE

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.140
STUDY

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:21.945
I SEE IT SAYS THAT THE THAT A

00:51:22.012 --> 00:51:22.412
CONCEPT PLAN WOULD BE.

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.514
NEEDED TO BE PREPARED FOR THE

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:25.115
GOLF COURSE SITE IS THAT RIGHT

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:25.449
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:26.349
SAYS IN YOUR IN THE IRVINE

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.918
DOCUMENT IT SAYS THAT THAT WOULD

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:30.987
TAKE -- TWELVE MONTHS THAT RITE

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.389
AID SOUNDS RIGHT AND LEFT ON MY

00:51:32.456 --> 00:51:34.191
HEAD BUT YEAH IF IT'S THERE

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:34.825
THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE ESTIMATED

00:51:34.891 --> 00:51:36.560
OKAY.

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.028
IN TERMS OF THE COST.

00:51:38.094 --> 00:51:39.196
IN TERMS THE COST SAVINGS

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:40.897
ASSUMING THAT MR FOR SCHOOL IS

00:51:40.964 --> 00:51:42.799
CORRECT.

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:44.234
RIGHT IN WE LEAVE THE RUN WHEN

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:44.701
PLACE.

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:47.003
WE ESTIMATE THAT TO BE ABOUT THE

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.205
SAME CORRECT WELL KEEP IN MIND

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.539
THERE STILL SEVENTY SEVEN

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:50.574
BUILDINGS ON THE SITE THAT WOULD

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.275
NEED TO BE TORN DOWN IN ADDITION

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:54.044
TO THE RUN ROUTE SEVENTY SEVEN

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.179
BUILDINGS I'M NOT GETTING A

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.214
CHANCE TO CORRECT THIS.

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.717
OKAY BUT YOU'LL GET A CHANCE.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:01.852
THE FIRST BILL -- ALL RIGHT

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:02.152
[inaudible]

00:52:02.219 --> 00:52:05.388
THE ARM.

00:52:05.455 --> 00:52:07.457
AND I HEARD TESTIMONY WITH

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.526
RESPECT -- TO WELL IF YOU IF YOU

AND I SHOULD AS THE SCHOOL

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.095
DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE EVER

00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:13.730
BEEN TO MILITARY FUNERAL EVER

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:16.233
BEEN TO A MILITARY FUNERAL.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.634
YES SIR I YEAH.

00:52:17.701 --> 00:52:19.402
YOUR FATHER SAID AND THEN THERE

00:52:19.469 --> 00:52:21.171
WAS A RIFLE VOLLEY IS THAT RIGHT.

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:24.441
DOES NOT ARISE IF YOU IF YOU

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:25.041
HEARD A RIFLE VOLLEY FROM THE

00:52:25.108 --> 00:52:25.442
FUNERAL.

00:52:25.509 --> 00:52:26.977
ALL RIGHT SO IF YOU HAVE HEARD A

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.178
RIFLE VOLLEY FROM THE FUNERAL AS

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:29.646
SOME OF THAT'S NO DOUBT HAVE.

00:52:29.713 --> 00:52:30.347
YOU YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.715
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ANY

00:52:31.781 --> 00:52:33.783
SORT OF SHOTS FIRED IN ANGER IS

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.286
THAT RIGHT.

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.854
PROBABLY ISN'T TO NOT SEEN IT I

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:39.589
WON'T ASK YOU THAT QUESTION

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:42.492
RIGHT BUT THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:45.195
DESENSITIZATION -- LEAK WAS FROM

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:47.664
THE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:48.732
SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH DOES HAVE

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:51.368
MORE INFORMATION AND DOES WORK

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:53.537
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THEIR

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:54.137
ACTIVE SHOOTER GIRLS.

00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:55.372
SO.

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:56.506
I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ON

00:52:56.573 --> 00:52:57.407
THAT IF YOU'D LIKE I WOULD

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:58.341
BECAUSE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER.

00:52:58.408 --> 00:53:00.377
IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN RIFLE

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:02.145
VOLLEYS AND IN FACT.

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:04.447
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THAT MIGHT

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:05.849
BE A TEACHING MOMENT MIGHT BE

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.217
TEACHING MOMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:53:07.284 --> 00:53:09.219
TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY HEAR.

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:10.587
THE RIFLE VOLLEYS BACK THAT

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:12.055
TEACHING MOMENT CAME FROM

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.490
TEACHER SHARON QUIRK SILVA.

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:14.524
THAT THOSE RIFLE VALLEY'S MAY

00:53:14.591 --> 00:53:16.092
REMIND THE SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:18.028
A VETERAN SOMEONE WHO SACRIFICE

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:21.097
AT LEASTPART OF THEIR LIFE IS

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:22.465
BEING BURIED BUT THE RIGHT.

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:23.633
AND WE REFERENCE THAT IN THE

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.367
FIRST PARAGRAPH OF OUR LETTER

00:53:24.434 --> 00:53:26.503
THAT WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:27.771
THIS AS A AS AN APPROPRIATE.

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:29.406
AND LONG STANDING WAY TO HONOR

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:30.974
THE VETERANS THAT SERVED US IN

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.609
THE RIFLE VOLLEYS WOULD SERVE AS

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:37.514
A TEACHING POINT PERHAPS ON A

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.215
REGULAR BASIS ILLUSTRATE.

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:40.083
PERHAPS ALL RIGHT [inaudible]

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.385

00:53:42.452 --> 00:53:42.986
IN MISTER FOSCO I I KNOW YOU

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:43.954

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:47.591
TO CORRECT.

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:48.992
FROM WHAT I JUST HEARD. THREE

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.328
THINGS THAT I'D RATHER I WANT TO

00:53:51.394 --> 00:53:52.262
SOUND LIKE EVERYBODY NINE AS I

00:53:52.329 --> 00:53:54.197
SAID JOE FRIDAY.

00:53:54.264 --> 00:53:55.131
JUST THE FACTS.

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:56.533
THERE ARE NOT SEVENTY SEVEN

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.869
BUILDINGS ON OUR SITE HELLO BUT

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:00.170
I'M SORRY.

00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.805
YEAH THERE ARE NOT SEVENTY SEVEN

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.773
BUILDINGS ON THE OR TO SITE

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.774
THERE ARE.

00:54:04.841 --> 00:54:06.476
TWENTY FIVE I HAD. THREE

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:07.944
CERTIFIED MEMBERS OF THE

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:10.347
NATIONAL DEMOLITION ASSOCIATION

00:54:10.413 --> 00:54:12.082
CONTRACTORS GO TO THE SITE WALK

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:14.317
AT ALL AND GIVE ME WRITTEN BIDS

00:54:14.384 --> 00:54:15.318
ON REMOVING EVERYTHING.

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:17.487
I HAVE IT.

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.255
THE LOCK STOCK AND BARREL OF ITS

00:54:19.322 --> 00:54:20.890
SIX MILLION DOLLARS.

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.727
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL THEY REMOVE

00:54:23.793 --> 00:54:24.361
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET

00:54:24.427 --> 00:54:25.762
A DAY IT'S A HUNDRED DATES.

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.697
IT'S ALL CLEAR.

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:29.899
AND THE GRADE THE SITE.

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:30.967
AND FOR AN EXTRA MILLION THE ALL

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:33.236
ALL THE UNDERGROUND.

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:35.972
SO THAT'S ABOUT SIX MILLION.

00:54:36.039 --> 00:54:38.041
ALL IN SITES CLEAR LOOKS THE

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.010
SAME AS THE GULF SIDE NOW.

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:41.645
AND THEN FOR FOUR MILLION YOU

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:43.013
BRING UP YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.948
MASQUERADE THE PROPERTY SO NOW

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.083
IT'S ALL SMOOTH NICE DIRT.

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.652
ELECTRIC GAS POWER DRAINAGE

00:54:48.718 --> 00:54:53.456
WATER EVERYTHING'S RIGHT AND NOW

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:56.126
YOU BUILD YOUR SUMMIT THERE. TEN

00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:57.861
BUCKS A SQUARE FOOT IS A

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.929
DYNAMITE CEMETERY.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.564
SO YOU CAN DO THE MATH QUICKLY.

00:55:01.631 --> 00:55:03.433
THIRTY MILLION FORTY MILLION FOR

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.834
THE WHOLE.

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:06.503
HUNDRED EIGHT SOME FIFTY MILLION.

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:09.105
BUILD YOU THE ENTIRE PLACE.

00:55:09.172 --> 00:55:10.340
IN TWO YEARS.

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:11.274
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.209
YOU CAN DO PHASE ONE SO THAT WAS

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.078
ONE THING I HAVE TWO MORE THINGS.

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:17.213
ON SO THAT WAS ON THE COST IT'S

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.049
SIX MILLION THE OWNER REPORT

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.817
SAYS IT'S TWENTY EIGHT MILLION

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:21.317
SO THAT'S A BIG.

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.852
BUMP.

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.087
IT'S NOT SEVENTY SUDDENLY IT'S

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.456
UNDER

00:55:26.523 --> 00:55:29.059
THE SECOND THING IS THAT --

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:30.827
MISTER CARMICHAEL USE THE WORD

00:55:30.894 --> 00:55:32.629
UNIFORM WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:33.863
GOLF COURSE AND I CAN'T THINK OF

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.465
A MORE.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:38.301
MISS ONLY BEHOLD WORD IT IS NOT

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.438
UNIFORM THIS SITE IS HORRIBLY.

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:44.174
DISFIGURED IF YOU WELL ANYBODY

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.875
THAT DEVELOPS AND BUYS LAND

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:47.677
WOULD WALK ON THIS SITE BECAUSE

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:48.912
OF ITS SHAPE.

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:51.147
SO I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHEAPER

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.149
PERSONALLY WHY WOULD YOU.

00:55:53.216 --> 00:55:54.851
TAKE AN INFERIOR SHAPE SITE AND

00:55:54.918 --> 00:55:56.386
START POURING MONEY INTO IT THE

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:59.022
YIELD ON THAT SITE WILL BE POOR.

00:55:59.089 --> 00:56:01.424
SO IT'S A GOOD THING IT -- IS

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.359
BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO GET.

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:04.794
TWO THIRDS OF THE GRAVE SITE YOU

00:56:04.861 --> 00:56:08.098
WITH A GUN ON THE HARD OF SIGHT.

00:56:08.164 --> 00:56:10.533
I'M SORRY THAT'S JUST A FAST.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.901
FINALLY IS NOT TWENTY ONE GUNS

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:14.304
AT SEVEN AND IT'S ONLY FOR GUYS

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.739
AND BULLETS FLYING OUT

00:56:15.805 --> 00:56:16.039
[inaudible]

00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.975
I UNDERSTAND.

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.009
WELL IT.

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:20.977
IS IT NO DOUBT.

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.145
AND I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.646
VETERANS.

00:56:23.713 --> 00:56:25.315
THAT I JUST READ MY DAD AT ALL

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:28.818
YEAH BUT I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE.

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.754
NO MY KNOWN AS A PLEASE.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.789
YOUR COMMENTS.

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:33.957
YOUR EXISTING.

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:34.924
BUT I'M NOT A MILITARY.

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:40.363
IN BACK TO MY QUESTION OR TEASE

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.931
THE DEMOLITION IS NOT.

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:45.201
A FORMIDABLE OF EXPENSIVE ITEM

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:46.803
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:47.971
LET ME AS THE AUTHOR QUESTION.

00:56:48.037 --> 00:56:50.140
THIS BILL DOES NOT PRO.

00:56:50.206 --> 00:56:51.508
OF PROHIBITED PRECLUDE.

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.242
THE FUTURE STUDY OF ALTERNATE

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:52.675
SITES IS THAT RIGHT.

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:53.076
RIGHT [inaudible]

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:55.512
ALL RIGHT.

00:56:55.578 --> 00:56:59.048
THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS.

00:56:59.115 --> 00:57:01.317
IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP.

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:02.886
I HAVE YET TO HAVE AN ANSWER TO

00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:04.154
MY BASIC QUESTION WHICH IS WHY

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.855
ARE WE DOING IT.

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.524
IF THE CITY COUNCIL RETAINS THE

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:09.726
AUTHORITY TO MAKE ITS DECISION

00:57:09.793 --> 00:57:11.161
AS TO WHERE TO CITE CEMETERY.

00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:12.896
OR NOT THIS IS THE CITY COUNCIL

00:57:12.962 --> 00:57:14.864
CAN CHOOSE A SITE BUT IN ORDER

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:16.599
TO HAVE A VETERANS CEMETERY THEY

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.034
HAVE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE

00:57:18.101 --> 00:57:19.068
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:20.203
UNDERSTAND THAT SO IF THEY

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.538
CHOOSE A SITE DIFFERENT FROM

00:57:21.604 --> 00:57:22.472
THIS BILL.

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:23.273
YOU'RE GOING TO BE BACK HERE

00:57:23.339 --> 00:57:25.208
NEXT YEAR WITH ANOTHER BILL IF

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:25.742
YOU AGREE WITH THEIR SITE

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:26.643
SELECTION.

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:28.812
WELL WHAT WE HAVE SAID IS AFTER

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:31.581
THIS MOVES FORWARD AS IT IS WERE

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:32.749
WILLING.

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.884
TO AS IT MOVES TO APPROPRIATIONS

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:37.120
CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION I MEAN

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:39.522
THERE THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.157
CONVERSATIONS THAT COULD.

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:44.394
CHANGE THE FACTS AS FAR AS OF

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:46.830
MORE INFORMATION WE'VE JUST

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:50.433
HEARD RIGHT NOW ALL THAT.

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:51.901
WINDOWS THE SENATE ANALYSIS CAME

00:57:51.968 --> 00:57:53.102
OUT IT SAID THAT THE GULF SITE

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:56.105
WAS READY TO GO AND THAT.

00:57:56.172 --> 00:57:59.375
WHAT THE HELL THAT HAS NOT EVEN?

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:02.011
ANALYZED IT THE SECOND PART IS

00:58:02.078 --> 00:58:03.079
THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:58:03.146 --> 00:58:05.048
THE TIMING WHICH WOULD BE FASTER

00:58:05.114 --> 00:58:07.183
OR I MEAN ON EACH SIDE YOU CAN

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.352
SEE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.186
TIME.

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:11.487
OR AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT'S

00:58:11.554 --> 00:58:13.756
GONNA TAKE TO MOVE BOTH OF THESE

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:16.326
FORWARD DEPENDING ON IF YOU.

00:58:16.392 --> 00:58:18.728
JUST ANALYSIS TO START WITH THE

00:58:18.795 --> 00:58:21.531
GOAL SITE WOULD REQUIRE THE BILL

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:22.699
TO BE SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.134
WHICH COULD BE.

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:26.002
YOU KNOW.

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:27.203
AS EARLY AS THE MIDDLE OF

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:30.139
SEPTEMBER OR IT.

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:31.474
YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL OF THAT TO

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.109
WILL THAT WHICH WILL HOW WILL

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.110
THE GOVERNOR WAY AND WHAT DOES

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:36.079
HE HAVE A PREFERENCE ALL OF

00:58:36.145 --> 00:58:37.814
THESE THINGS NOTHING CAN START

00:58:37.881 --> 00:58:39.182
INTO YOU.

00:58:39.249 --> 00:58:42.585
SECURE THE REMAINING.

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:44.654
WHATEVER IT IS LET'S SEE THIRTY

00:58:44.721 --> 00:58:46.222
MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT

00:58:46.289 --> 00:58:46.522
[inaudible]

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:50.960
RIGHT.

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:52.228
SO THERE'S STILL TIME ATTACHED.

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.730
AND YOU CAN SEE THERE'S PROS AND

00:58:53.796 --> 00:58:56.566
CONS ON BOTH SITE BUT RIGHT NOW

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:57.867
WE WANT TO DO IS MOVE FORWARD

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.302
WHAT WE HAVE BECAUSE THE

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.738
INFORMATION THAT WE HAD UP INTO

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:03.239
THE LAST FEW DAYS.

00:59:03.306 --> 00:59:05.008
WAS THERE WAS NO INTEREST IN THE

00:59:05.074 --> 00:59:06.542
GULF SITE THE GULF SO IT JUST

KIND OF APPEARED AM I GUESS MY

00:59:08.778 --> 00:59:10.313
QUESTION IS WHY DOES THE CITY

THE SITE OF THE GULF SITE

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:14.984
CLEARED ALREADY.

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.587
AND IF THAT WAS OF MAJOR SITE TO

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:21.424
pTHIS LANGUAGE THREE MONTHS AGO

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.860
