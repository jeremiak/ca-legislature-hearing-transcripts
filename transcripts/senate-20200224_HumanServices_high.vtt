AND SMALL. AND SO WE'RE

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.311
WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY WE

THEY COULD BE THERE YOU KNOW.

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:04.802
COUNTING THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:30:04.869 --> 00:30:08.640
COLLECTING US AS THE- AND IT

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.441
COULD BE STAFF SO WE DON'T HAVE

00:30:10.508 --> 00:30:12.210
A SOLID NUMBER ON IT WE JUST

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:13.378
HAVE A BALL PARK BUT WE'RE

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:15.446
WORKING TO SEE HOW WE CAN

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:18.616

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:25.123
OKAY SO THAT THE BIGGER PRIVATE

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.591

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.993
THE BEDS ARE LIKE CAPTURED WHEN

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.929
YOU LOOK HURDLE CAPACITY IN THE

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.931
STATE IT'S NOT SHOWING THE

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:35.533
UTTERANCE BUT IS ESSENTIALLY

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.301
IT'S BEEN LEVEL FOR THE LAST

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:41.439

PART AND OUR POPULATION'S AGING

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:47.979
SO THE THAT. SO YOU THINK THAT

00:30:48.046 --> 00:30:50.081
THE ACTUAL DEMAND FOR THESE IS

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:51.282
ACTUALLY EVEN THOUGH OUR

00:30:51.349 --> 00:30:52.951
CAPACITY IS THE SAME AS

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:55.153

THE SOLUTION WE CAN TO THERE'S

01:11:30.853 --> 01:11:32.621
NO DOUBT THAT OUR CURRENT MODEL

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:33.322
FOR BOARDING CARES IS NEITHER

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.691
SUSTAINABLE NOR SAFE IN MANY

THAT WOULD AMELIORATE THE PROP

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:24.767
IT WOULD DOUBLE THE REVENUE THE

01:13:24.833 --> 01:13:26.034
BORN CARE PROVIDERS COULD

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:31.974

WHO ARE DEVASTATED AND THEY'RE

01:20:30.458 --> 01:20:31.059
LIVING IN HORRENDOUS

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:33.094
CONDITIONS. BUT THERE PEOPLE

THEY'RE LOVELY PEOPLE WHO IN

01:20:34.796 --> 01:20:36.698
THE AREA IN THE RIGHT CONTEXT

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:38.099
FOR EXAMPLE BEING IN A BOARDING

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.235
CARE. WILL THRIVE IN THEIR OWN

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:42.571
WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT- I TAKE

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.105
WITH ME THE OTHER THING IS THAT

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.374
WE HAVE YOU KNOW THESE WE HAVE

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:48.543
LOCKED FACILITIES PEOPLE CALL

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:50.045
THEM I AM THESE. AND WE HAVE

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:51.213
YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS WERE READY

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:52.681
TO GO BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:55.217
PROPER SUPPORTS AND LIVING

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:55.784
ENVIRONMENTS. AND IT'S VERY

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:58.286
COSTLY IS ALSO IN MY OPINION.

01:20:58.353 --> 01:20:59.354
NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:02.090
ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S- THAT'S

01:21:02.157 --> 01:21:02.691
SOMETHING THAT REALLY REALLY

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:05.961
BOTHERS ME. THE THING ABOUT

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.729
BURNING CARE FOR ME IS THAT IN

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:10.432
A BOARDING CARE. IS TYPE OF

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:12.067
SHARED OR COLLABORATIVE

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:15.604
HOUSING. AND IT'S A IT'S A IT'S

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:18.740
A RESOURCE. THAT IS REALLY

01:21:18.807 --> 01:21:20.775
SOMETHING THAT- THAT THAT I

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:23.111
THINK IS NOT. RECOGNIZED IN THE

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:25.347
WAY THAT IT COULD BE. AS

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.048
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE MUST

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:29.117
LEVERAGE. IN OTHER WORDS WE

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.952
SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:31.953
TIME A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.388
MONEY DEVELOPING. NEW

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:35.156
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH TAKES A

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:37.659
LOT OF TIME AT THE SAME TIME

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.427
THAT THIS KIND OF COLLAPSE OF A

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:43.965
SYSTEM IS HAVE IT IS OCCURRING.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.200
THE OTHER THING ABOUT ABOUT

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.302
BOARDING. BUT I'M A I'M A SICK

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:48.703
A MENTAL HEALTH GUY AND

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:49.938
BOARDING CARE MEANS A CERTAIN

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.906
THING TO ME BUT IN THE PROCESS

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.708
OF LEARNING ABOUT THE REST OF

01:21:53.775 --> 01:21:56.077
THE ARE SEE IF YOU CAN ARE FOR

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.380
OLD. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:00.615
THINGS LOTS OF TYPES SO HE'S

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.951
OUT TO DIFFERENT TO POPULATION

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.286
AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.420
WE NEED TO KATE NICE THAT WE

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:10.892
NEED AS IT IS NOT. ONE THING-

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:12.894
FOR MY PEOPLE. IT'S OFTEN THE

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.963
PURPOSE. THE PLACE AND THE

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.065
PEOPLE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT AS

01:22:17.132 --> 01:22:19.067
MUCH AS IT IS THE CARE. AND WE

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:23.171
CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THAT IT'S

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:25.373
BURNING CARE IS A VERY RARE

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.108
ENTITY. I FOLLOW BECAUSE THE

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:29.044
BUSINESS MODEL- OKAY IN IS

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:31.012
ACTUALLY ARE BREAKING AND IT'S

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:32.714
WHY I THINK I YOU KNOW

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:34.816
CERTAINLY WE'RE WE'RE ALL HERE

01:22:34.883 --> 01:22:35.317
FOR DIFFERENT VULNERABLE

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.485
POPULATIONS BUT- OPTED TO SEE

01:22:37.552 --> 01:22:39.421
THIS HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.922
COUNTY AN ALARMING RATE I MEAN

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:44.059
IT. IS IT'S MARCH. EVEN

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.394
FEBRUARY. YOU KNOW I'M SAYING

01:22:46.461 --> 01:22:48.430
IT'S THIS IS A PROCESS THAT IS

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:49.998
EXHILARATING IT IT DOESN'T STOP

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.666
AND WE'RE USING HUNDREDS AND

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:53.034
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF BEDS

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.904
SINCE I TOOK OVER THIS ROLE

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:58.239
THREE YEARS AGO. AND WITH THE

01:22:58.306 --> 01:22:59.307
FIX TO THE BUSINESS MODEL ISN'T

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:00.575
CLEAR THERE'S A LOT OF

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.077
INTERESTING- POSSIBILITIES

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:04.179
NOTHING. SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:05.914
BEEN REYES INCLUDING THE SS I

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:07.415
RATE. BUT THE THING ABOUT THE

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.584
LOSS OF A BOARDING CARE BAD IS

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:11.553
IT'S NOT JUST THAT YOU'RE

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:12.821
LOSING A UNIT. YOU LOSING US.

01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:14.789
AND WE LIVE IN WE HAVE IT WITH

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:17.292
THE NIMBY. NIGHTMARE FOR THOSE

01:23:17.359 --> 01:23:18.093

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:20.995

TEN BEDS AND A SITE WHEN WE'RE

TRYING TO PROMOTE INCLUSION.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.769
AND REINTEGRATION IS REALLY

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:30.271
REALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I DON'T

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.172
THAT'S OF THE VALUE OF A SITE

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:34.075
CANNOT BE LOST. AS WE- PUSH

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.544
THIS EFFORT SO FOR ME IT'S NOT

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:38.947
JUST ABOUT SAVING AND RESTORING

01:23:39.013 --> 01:23:39.581
THE BOARDING CARE NETWORK IT'S

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:43.518
ABOUT GROWING IT. AND YES THE

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.854
RATE IS ONE THING THAT WOULD BE

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.355
FANTASTIC RIGHT HOUSING THAT.

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:49.290
PORTING CARES HAVE GOTTEN A BAD

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.659

SO THERE EASIER BUT ALL THERE'S

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:57.232
BEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.666
BECAUSE THERE HAVEN'T HAD THE

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:02.270
RATES HAVEN'T HAD. CAPITAL TO

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:05.774

THERE'S A LICENSING COMPONENT

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.502
AND I THINK THAT IF WE REFER

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.737
AROUND THE FACT THAT FOR

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:37.472

<u>E NEED TO SEPARATE THE IT IS</u>

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:16.304
THE IDEA OF BOARD WHICH IN ONE

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:18.139
SENSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:20.909
THE AIR WHICH IS A NOT SENSE

01:26:20.975 --> 01:26:22.677
THAT THEY BOARDED THERE ARE

01:26:22.744 --> 01:26:27.348
FACILITIES THAT. CORD I. PRICES

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:27.916
CITIES IN THE PROVIDE BOARD

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.051

ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS DUMPING

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:32.654
PEOPLE INTO THESE CHEAP

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.123
ALTERNATIVES- WHY. BECAUSE

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:36.491
THEY'RE CHEAPER BECAUSE IT

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:39.327
DOESN'T COST THEM AS MUCH SO WE

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:40.128
NEED TO TAKE A LOOK IF WE ARE

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:42.931

CARE IN UNLICENSED FACILITIES-

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.342
I THINK SOME OF THE ANSWERS ARE

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:56.644
PRETTY OBVIOUS WE NEED MORE

01:26:56.711 --> 01:26:57.412

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:44.225
THAT THEY CAN FUND THESE KINDS

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:47.795
PROGRAM. PEOPLE GET DEEP THINK.

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:54.636

STATUTES AND IT DOESN'T MAKE

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:31.639
SENSE IT HAS NEVER MADE SENSE

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:33.875
EVEN BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER FUNDED

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:35.677
IT- I WOULD SAY THAT TO BE

01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:36.644
SYSTEM IT WOULD TO BE

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.546

SOCIAL SUPPORT AND FINANCIAL

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.888

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:49.090
THAT WE FUND THIS LEVELS OF

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.325

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.161
TIERED LEVEL OF CARE SYSTEM.

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:58.366

ABOUT. FOR CC WE TALK ABOUT ALL

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:03.371

01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:05.473
ACTUALLY OVERSEE THE KINDS OF

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:06.641
THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.875
OVERSEE IN THAT THEY'RE MORE

01:29:07.942 --> 01:29:10.244
THAN WILLING TO OVERSEE-

01:29:10.311 --> 01:29:13.681
THEY'VE REGULATE OVER SEVENTY

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:14.282
THOUSAND DIFFERENT FACILITIES

01:29:14.348 --> 01:29:15.750
STATE RIDE ARE DIFFERENT

01:29:15.817 --> 01:29:18.519
PROGRAMS STATEWIDE- YOU KNOW

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:20.755
WHEN I STARTED MY ORGANIZATION

01:29:20.822 --> 01:29:22.023
THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. WE USED

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:23.524
TO DO THEY USED TO DO

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.960
EVALUATIONS EVERY TWICE A YEAR

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:28.629
AND THEN IT WENT TO- ONCE A

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.732
YEAR AND THEN IT WENT TO EVERY

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:31.799
FIVE YEARS AND I HAVE BEEN

01:29:31.866 --> 01:29:33.768
THERE I HAVE WATCHED THEIR BUT-

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:35.670
BEING CUT. CUT CUT CUT AND THE

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.038
KINDS OF SERVICES OVERSIGHT

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.639
THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE ALSO

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.708
BEING CUT. SO TO PRETEND THAT

01:29:40.775 --> 01:29:42.477
WE'VE ACTUALLY FULLY FUNDED

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:43.811

01:29:43.878 --> 01:29:47.248
HAVEN'T- WITH IT ANYONE SPECS

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:47.849
SHINS AN INCREASE IN LICENSE

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:50.084
THE APPLICATIONS. STOP ALLIES

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.720
DOWN CATION POLICY. THE

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:55.389
DEPARTMENT HAS STRUGGLED TO

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:56.958
MEET ITS GOALS THAT THERE'S

01:29:57.024 --> 01:30:02.497
GOING TO INSURE QUALITY OF CARE.

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:04.766
WHY OF THE REASONS THE THANK.

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.300

WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:11.105
IT'S WHERE YOU THAT MONEY IT'S

01:30:11.172 --> 01:30:12.440
CERTAINLY A SWITCH FOR CANDOR

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:13.941
TO BE PRAISING AND ENFORCEMENT

01:30:14.008 --> 01:30:16.944

THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO I

01:33:57.365 --> 01:33:59.333
AND SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.369
A WAY TO. SORT OF TRY TO

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:04.005
REPAIR. IN THAT KIND OF

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.840
SOCIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA THAT

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:08.142
THAT USED TO HELP FAMILIES

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:09.744
DURING THOSE KIND OF INTER

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.846
GENERATIONAL CHALLENGES SO

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:12.880
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BY

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:14.548
BUILDING MORE FOR. YOU KNOW OR

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:16.684
BUILDING OUR WAY OUT OF THIS

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:19.286
WITH WITH SENIOR HOMES ALTHOUGH

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:21.956

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:25.593
THOUGHTS ON THAT. I HAVE SOME

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:26.694
THOUGHTS ON IT BECAUSE MY MOM

ABLE TO STAY AT HOME I WAS BACK

TIMES A YEAR BUT I WAS LUCKY.

01:34:36.237 --> 01:34:38.606
AJ WE'RE IRISH SHEET WE HAVE

01:34:38.672 --> 01:34:40.307
SEVEN KIDS IN THE FAMILY SO WE

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:42.710
COULD TAKE TURNS. HOWEVER AND I

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.578
AGREE WEEK I GREW UP THE SAME

01:34:44.645 --> 01:34:45.980

LIVING WITH THEM WE TOOK CARE

01:34:50.317 --> 01:34:52.219
OF MY AUNT. WHAT I HEAR FROM

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:54.688
PEOPLE TODAY ARE ON THE PHONE

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:57.024
WE GET HUNDREDS OF PHONE CALLS

01:34:57.091 --> 01:34:59.593
EVERY MONTH WHAT I HEAR IS THE

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:02.129
GAS FOR A OF KIDS THEY'RE NOT

01:35:02.196 --> 01:35:05.332
HERE. THEY GO TO WASHINGTON DC

01:35:05.399 --> 01:35:07.301
TO GET A JOB WE GET CALLS FROM

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:08.869
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:11.072
PEOPLE MY MOM'S IN CAL. AND

01:35:11.138 --> 01:35:13.707
SHE'S SECOND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

TO DO. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:16.377
BRIDGE THAT PARTICULAR GAP BUT

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:19.847
DO THINK THAT. YOU KNOW WE

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:21.749
CERTAINLY CAN A- JET AND A LOT

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.818
OF PEOPLE THEIR KIDS DON'T GET.

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:26.153
SO THAT DATA WANT TO DEAL WITH

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.955
I WOULD SUSPECT MORE THAN HALF

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:33.194
DON'T BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.830
YEAH AT. WELL WE'RE NOT. HAVING

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:36.730
INNER CHANNEL. FAMILIES IS NOT

01:35:36.797 --> 01:35:37.965
THE PAM. I'M SURE THINKING IT

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.800
MIGHT BE IT IT'S ONE OF THOSE.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.235
THAT PERHAPS WE NEED TO THINK

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:43.070
ABOUT MORE WHEN PEOPLE DO

01:35:43.137 --> 01:35:45.372
CHOOSE TO LIVE IN THE SAME

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:47.007
WORSE OR CLOSE. THEIR SHARED

01:35:47.074 --> 01:35:48.709
HOUSING- PROJECTS IT WHERE YOU

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:51.112
ARE YOU MATCH. COLLEGE STUDENTS

01:35:51.178 --> 01:35:53.114
WITH AN ELDERLY PERSON WHILE

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.715
THEY ARE LIVING THERE. I THINK

01:35:54.782 --> 01:35:56.817
HONESTLY THAT IT STOPS WHEN

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:57.585
THAT PERSON'S NEEDS BECOME TOO

01:35:57.651 --> 01:36:00.421
HOT- AND THAT'S WHEN IT STOPS.

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:02.022
AND THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE END UP

01:36:02.089 --> 01:36:03.524
GOING INTO A BOARDING CARE

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.059
RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY AND

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:06.627
THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES I

01:36:06.694 --> 01:36:08.429
AGREE PEOPLE. WE NEED TO DO

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.864
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.532
THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS OVER

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:15.469
THE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA- I

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:16.270
GUESS I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS.

01:36:16.337 --> 01:36:17.805
IF I COULD JUST A BRIEFLY WE'RE

01:36:17.872 --> 01:36:21.075
WE'RE WORKING NOT ME ON- ON A

01:36:21.142 --> 01:36:22.710
PROGRAM THAT WILL- YOU KNOW

01:36:22.776 --> 01:36:25.045
REUNITE FAMILIES- PARTICULARLY

01:36:25.112 --> 01:36:25.946
WITH THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.014
FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.315
HAVE BEEN IN ON OFF THE STREETS

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:30.618
AND AN IN AND OUT OF JAIL- ONE

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:31.919
OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT I

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:34.155
THINK IS IT. IS ILLNESS

01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:35.689
FRACTURES FAMILIES AND WE HAVE

01:36:35.756 --> 01:36:37.091
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

01:36:37.158 --> 01:36:39.760
BETTER ACCESS TO TREATMENT ON

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:41.061
THE OTHER THING I'M JUST YOU

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.697
KNOW JUST SAY IT THE YOU KNOW-

01:36:43.764 --> 01:36:46.066
HIPPA. AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:47.935
ARE CHALLENGED BY WHICH ARE

01:36:48.002 --> 01:36:50.437
FEDERAL DON'T HELP BECAUSE THEY

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:51.972
REALLY DON'T ALLOW FAMILIES TO

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:54.942
COMMUNICATE ABOUT CORE ISSUES

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.577
AND THAT'S A BIG BIG PROBLEM.

01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:58.245
YEAH I WILL JUST ADD THAT IN

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.046
ALL OF OUR HOUSING

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:00.080
CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.116
RIGHT THE FIRST UP THE FEEDBACK

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.484
IS MORE HOUSING BUT THE SECOND

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:05.319
IS MORE INNOVATION AND JUST

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:05.920
THREE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:07.855
AROUND THE STATE I'M SAN DIEGO

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:10.824
A COUNTY HAS PRE APPROVED FIVE

01:37:10.891 --> 01:37:12.226
EIGHTY YOU MODELS SO IF YOU USE

01:37:12.293 --> 01:37:13.594
ONE OF THOSE FIVE EIGHTY USE IT

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.728
WILL BE APPROVED YOUR SAME THE

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:16.830
PLANNING COSTS YOU SAVE SOME

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:18.966
TIME THERE NEVADA COUNTY AT THE

01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.234
ROUND TABLE UP THERE THEY SAID

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.068
WE HAVE PLENTY OF SQUARE

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:22.903
FOOTAGE IS JUST WITH THE WRONG

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:24.471
PEOPLE IN THE WRONG. CAN I

01:37:24.538 --> 01:37:26.440
SUBDIVIDE MY HOUSE CAN I CAN I

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:27.575
DO THAT PUT A KITCHEN IN THE

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.009
BACK AND HOW DO WE HELP LOCAL

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:30.211
ZONING AND LOCAL REGULATION

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:31.979
MOVED TO THAT HUGE HOUSE

01:37:32.046 --> 01:37:33.781
BECOMING A TRIPLEX OR A MULTI

01:37:33.847 --> 01:37:35.382
PLEX- AND THEN MY OWN

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.650
NEIGHBORHOOD A NEW AFFORDABLE

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.485
HOUSING UNIT HAS GONE UP THAT

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:40.454
IS HALF SENIORS AND HALF OF

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:41.488
FOSTER YOUTH AGING OUT THE

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:43.190
SYSTEM AND SO AGAIN THAT MIX

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:45.492
GENERATIONAL CROSS- NOT JUST

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.061
SENIOR CENTER SENIOR HOUSING

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.896
BUT CROSS GENERATIONAL SO I

01:37:48.963 --> 01:37:49.763
THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:51.398
EXAMPLES OF THAT AND HOW WE CAN

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:53.000
HELP SCALE AND SPEED. THIS IS

01:37:53.067 --> 01:37:54.702
SAM DISCO THEY MADE A VERY VERY

01:37:54.768 --> 01:37:57.705
DIFFICULT TO BUILD IN LOS UNITS

01:37:57.771 --> 01:38:00.808
AND ALSO I WAS AT A HEARING

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:03.677
FOR- SOMEBODY'S TAXES THIS

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:05.613
ELDERLY COUPLE THEY BUILT OF

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:08.349
DID YOU KNOW AS THE BATHROOM IN

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:10.951
THEIR HOUSE AND TAXES WERE

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:12.453
INCREASED TO THOUGHT DOLLARS A

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:19.026
YEAR. WHICH IS. THAT'S JAMES.

01:38:19.093 --> 01:38:21.028
WE MAY. I THE AND YOUR TAX GO

01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:22.162
UP YOU BUILD IN LOS. IN

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:23.731
PARTICULAR PLACE LIKE. THIS TAX

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:26.767
ARE PRETTY ALREADY SO. WELL I

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:27.368
WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT WE ARE

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.203
THIS TO THE DESERT OF A ENERGY.

01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:31.605
RELATIONSHIPS AND THE THAT THEY

01:38:31.672 --> 01:38:33.240
CAN BE A WIN WIN WHEN YOU'RE

01:38:33.307 --> 01:38:34.608
DEALING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:35.442
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A CHALLENGE

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:36.610
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.078
COGNITIVE ISSUES THAT CAN BE A

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:39.880
CHALLENGE. BUT PUTTING PEOPLE

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:42.283
IN THESE OTHER FACILITIES ISN'T

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:44.485
IT HI IT JUST ISN'T THE PANACEA

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:46.053
THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHEN WE

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:47.688
HAVE TO DO THAT BUT- I JUST

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.390
WONDER IF WE COULD START

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.358
THINKING ABOUT. TAKING

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.727
ADVANTAGE OF FAMILIAR OF FAMILY

01:38:53.794 --> 01:38:55.629
RELATIONSHIPS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.464
RECOGNIZING THEIR VALUE I MEAN

01:38:57.531 --> 01:38:58.465
THEY'VE BEEN A THEY'VE BEEN

01:38:58.532 --> 01:39:00.901
AROUND AS LONG AS HUMANKIND IN

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.436
AND AS THEY GET MORE AND MORE

01:39:02.503 --> 01:39:03.937
ATTENUATED THERE IS THAT

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:05.272
GREATER ISOLATION THAT GREATER

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:06.840
LOSS AND ALL ALL THOSE THINGS

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:07.908
SAID. WHICH IS NOT GOING TO

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:10.144
BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF SO I WOULD

01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:12.579
JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT IT

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:14.381
AND HOPE THAT- WE SEE SOME

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:19.153
DISCUSSION AGAIN IT'S NOT THE

01:39:19.219 --> 01:39:20.821
ANSWER BUT IT COULD BE PART OF

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:25.292
THE- JACK. I HAVE QUESTION FOR.

01:39:25.359 --> 01:39:26.593
I WONDERED IF THERE'S I KNOW

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:29.396

TO POINT OUT- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.464
SENATOR PAN TALKED ABOUT WAS

01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:33.400
THE- IT SEEMS TO BE A STABLE

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:36.169
BAD. IN THE ASSISTED LIVING.

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:37.738
THERE WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A

01:44:37.804 --> 01:44:39.706
TEN THOUSAND- BED COUNT

01:44:39.773 --> 01:44:42.676
INCREASE IN THE LAST. FEW YEARS

01:44:42.743 --> 01:44:43.477
IN AND THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:45.979
DOCUMENTATION FROM C. C. L.

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:49.116
WHAT'S CHANGED IS THE NUMBER OF

01:44:49.182 --> 01:44:50.617
LICENSES SO WE'VE HAD A

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:51.818
DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:54.221
LICENSES AND INCREASE THE

01:44:54.287 --> 01:44:56.857
NUMBER OF BEDS. THAT INCREASE

01:44:56.923 --> 01:44:58.492
IN THE NUMBER OF BEDS IS NOT

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.861
SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNIZE YOUR

01:45:00.927 --> 01:45:03.263
CONVERSATION EARLIER ABOUT THE

01:45:03.330 --> 01:45:04.564
GROWING NUMBER OF SENIORS THAT

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:06.633
NEED THE CARE. BUT WHAT OUR

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:07.934
MEMBERS ARE SAYING IS PEOPLE

01:45:08.001 --> 01:45:09.603
ARE ENTERING INTO ASSISTED

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:10.671
LIVING LATER WHEN THEY'RE

01:45:10.737 --> 01:45:12.539
SICKER. WHEN THEY HAVE HIGHER

01:45:12.606 --> 01:45:14.174
NEEDS AND SO THEY'RE STAYING AT

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:16.209
HOME LONGER THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:18.278
PATCH THINGS- WITH LOCAL

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.047
SERVICES FOR LONGER BEFORE THEY

01:45:20.113 --> 01:45:22.049
GO INTO ASSISTED LIVING. THAT

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.850
PUTS GREATER PRESSURE ON THE

01:45:23.917 --> 01:45:26.119
ASSISTED LIVING STAFF THEN ALSO

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:28.889
PUTS A MORE PEOPLE WHEN THEY DO

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:31.491
RUN OUT OF FUNDS. IF YOU'RE IN

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.026
AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY AND

01:45:33.093 --> 01:45:34.494
YOU'RE PAYING FOR AND FIVE

01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:35.395
THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:36.530
YOU RUN OUT OF FUNDS YOU

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:38.265
PROBABLY ARE NOT GOING TO

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.299
BECOME ELIGIBLE THE BULK OF

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:40.667
THEM ARE NOT GONNA BE ELIGIBLE

01:45:40.734 --> 01:45:42.369
FOR THE SS I SS BE RATE.

01:45:42.436 --> 01:45:44.438
BECAUSE THEIR MONTHLY INCOME IS

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:46.773
OVER THAT POVERTY LIMIT. SO

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:48.208
THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT I

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:50.210
REALLY WORRY ABOUT THEY'RE NOT

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.212

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:54.548
P. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER

01:45:54.614 --> 01:45:55.449
PROGRAM WAS REFERENCE THAN THAT

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:57.884
PROBABLY WOULD BE THE EASIEST

01:45:57.951 --> 01:46:00.620
WAY. TO ADDRESS THAT- INCOME

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:02.856
PERSON AS LONG AS YOU ADDED A

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:06.259
SHIPPER OF COST. NO THE PERSON

01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:07.394
CAN APPLY FOR THE ASSISTED

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:08.729
LIVING WAIVER IF THEIR MONTHLY

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:11.331
INCOME IS TOO HIGH. I THINK

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:11.965
THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS WE CAN

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:15.102

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.079
THAT CAUSED US TO EMBARK ON
