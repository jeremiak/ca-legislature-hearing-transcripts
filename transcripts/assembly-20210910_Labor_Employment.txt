AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM WHEN YOU FIND A BILL THAT DOES THIS MUCH DAMAGE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT NOT JUST CONTINUE THIS THIS EXERCISE SO I'LL BE LAYING OFF TODAY- BUT- THAT CERTAINLY IS NO REFLECTION ON THE IMPORTANCE THAT I FEEL THE NEWSPAPER DISTRIBUTION CARRIERS HAVE THANKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE THINK GO SECOND MISTER WARD. AS CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I AGREE THAT WE- SHOULDN'T BE CONTINUE TO TURN OUR WHEELS AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY WHAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- IT WAS A PROCESS THAT THAT- I WASN'T HAPPY WITH I DON'T THINK- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE COMFORTABLE WITH- AND THERE WAS. LITTLE TO NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE NEWSPAPER INDUSTRY. AND MY OFFICE BUT THIS YEAR WAS DIFFERENT- AND I THINK TO. A SPECIALTIES POINT- WE THERE WAS A GENUINE EFFORT. TO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER TO- TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT IF ANYTHING COULD BE DONE. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE DATA THAT FRANKLY- WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR- BUT I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A COUPLE YEARS THE LAST TWO THREE YEARS. AND SO THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER- OF LABOR'S BEEN A KEY BUT A PARTNER AT THE TABLE BY DOING THESE BECAUSE THE DISCUSSIONS AND CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK THAT- WITH OF THEIR THEIR- DIFFERENT CLAIMS AS TO THE DEGREE OF- MISS CLASSIFICATION. THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN ISSUE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CURRENT MODEL WORKS FOR THE INDUSTRY- BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE PUBLISHERS ARE CONCERNED. LET'S GET THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DIG A LITTLE DEEPER. RATHER THAN- KIND OF THE CHARADE OF DECIDING THESE EXTENSIONS EXTENSIONS FOR EXTENSION SAKE- I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY. DO SOMETHING MORE MEANINGFUL WHEN WE COME BACK- DETERMINE YOU KNOW. BECAUSE THIS INDUSTRY IS DIFFERENT- BUT THERE HAS TO BE THAT RECOGNITION. PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF- OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING TO IT IS MOVED TOWARDS DIGITAL AND HOW A LOT OF PAPERS SPECIAL OF THE LOCAL PAPERS ABOUT PAPERS DESCRIBING BUT- AT THE SAME TIME. WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE WORKERS AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALSO WORKERS ARE CAUGHT UP IN THIS INDUSTRY. THAT MAY VERY WELL BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. AND WE DON'T WANT THAT EITHER AND SO WITH THAT- AGAIN EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION. THE NEWSPAPER- THE NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION- THE LABOR FEDERATION AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN PART OF THE THIS. LONG BUT I THINK IMPORTANT PROCESS BUT THAT IS BUCKLEY US WHEN I BOTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCHER. VENTURA SUBSECTOR CALL PLEASE. MOTION IS RECOMMEND AMENDMENTS BEACON. IN KALRA.
