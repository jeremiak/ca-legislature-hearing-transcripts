IN MAINTAINING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. WHEN I BEGAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT THIS SPRING AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. I WAS AMAZED AT THE EFFORTS AND THE COLLABORATION AS WE EVALUATED HOW TO FIRST AND FOREMOST KEEP INDIVIDUALS SAFE. NOT JUST THE INDIVIDUALS WE PROVIDE SERVICES FOR BUT THE STAFF TO SUPPORT THEM AND THE COMMUNITY AROUND THEM THE FAMILIES- SOME OF THAT WAS LIMITING VISITATION TO REDUCE EXPOSURE. BUT AS AS WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE WE LOOKED AT MAYBE FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE SERVICES CONTINUED BY AUTHORIZING REMOTE ACCESS OR ALTERNATIVE. LOCATIONS TO DELIVER SERVICES. AS THE NEW FOR THIS SO CNTINUE FROM THE STATE'S RESPONSE WE ALSO EXPANDED CAPACITY UNDER DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES. AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY WHICH WAS OPERATED BY OUR SISTER AGENCIES- THIS WORK DIDN'T END THERE AS AS THE- PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CONTINUES WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE BASED ON STATE.

AS WELL AS NEW RATES FOR HELPING PEOPLE PORTANTINO MORE SAFELY WHETHER THAT'S- INCLUDING ONE OR TWO STAFF TO STAY WITH INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORT OF LIVING- I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR ON GOING EFFORTS AS WE EVALUATE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES OF OUR DEPARTMENT STAFF ALSO LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF COMPLETING THEIR TASKS TO ENSURE THAT IT OPERATIONS CONTINUE AND THAT WE CAN SUPPORT IT ABOUT OUR SERVICES SYSTEM- AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND BEYOND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WE ARE EVALUATING. THINGS THAT WORKED WELL THINGS THAT NEEDED ADDITIONAL. NO EFFORTS AND WERE TAKEN WHETHER NOT SEEKING FEDERAL AUTHORITY OR CHANGING SOME OF OUR REQUESTING STATUTORY OR REGULATORY CHANGES- BUT OUR OUR LONGER TERM GOAL WILL BE ENSURING THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES.

IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE KNOW THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT GOING ALL RIGHT AS THE WAIVER IS UP FOR RENEWAL. ARE YOU.

I HAD BEEN TRYING TO FIGHT FOR MY PATIENCE WITH THE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND- IDEAS AND- I TROUBLES AND- MANY OTHER PROVIDERS WHO ARE GIVING A HARD TIME TO MY PATIENTS AND- I BELIEVE- HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT NOT A PRIVILEGE. I ALSO BELIEVE NOT ONLY HEALTHCARE QUALITY HEALTHCARE HEALTH GET RICHER THAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND THAT WAS THE REASON I WANTED TO MOVE ON FROM ME AND I AM. TO THE STATE LEVEL AND BEYOND BOTTOM MEDICAL VOTE. BECAUSE THEY- THE REAL JOB OF MEDICAL VOTE IS TO PROVIDE A QUALITY HEALTHCARE. IT IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY THERE ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES.

WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THE POSITIONS AND PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DOING THE JOB IN A TREMENDOUS WAY. NO PROFESSION IS COMPLETELY OUT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLED BAD APPLES. AND IT IS MY JOB AND MY DUTY TO MAKE SURE THAT NO NEGLIGENCE HAPPENED BECAUSE- TWO THINGS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IN LIFE HEALTHCARE AND LIFE. AND IF SOMEBODY IS NEGLIGENT AND HIT A PATIENT INTENTIONALLY UNINTENTIONALLY RATHER DIFFICULT TO USE A DIFFERENT IF THEY'RE NOT APPLYING THE STANDARD OF CARE TO THE PATIENTS I THINK WE NEED TO SHOULD WE SHOULD HAVE.

OVER A CENTURY. AFTER ESCAPING THE FIRE AND RELOCATING TO CHICO I IMMEDIATELY TOOK INVENTORY OF MY FAMILY MY STAFF. AND ORGANIZED BY PARTNERS ABILITY TO SET UP A TEMPORARY CALL CENTER. YOU CARE FOR PATIENTS WHO WERE DISPLACED. WHICH WAS OVER. FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES WERE WERE DESTROYED. IN ROLE AS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR THE WORLD HEALTH CLINIC I PARTNERED WITH THE FEATHER HOSPITAL INADMISSIBLE. DEMAND PHONES ENSURE THAT MY MEDICAL STAFF WAS AVAILABLE TO- DID TO TAKE CARE OF PATIENTS THAT WERE OUT OF MEDICATIONS ARE NEEDED. ADDITIONAL CARE. SOCIAL YOU PARTNER WITH BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA AND TELLER AND OF. HI HERE TO TELEMEDICINE PLATFORM THAT WAS DEVELOPED SO WE CAN WE CAN. MANAGE THESE PATIENTS DREADED DISTANCE AND COULDN'T FIND PRIMARY CARE WHERE THEY HAD AND WERE A DENTISTRY TO. I WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE BACK HER CURRENT LOCATION WORK IN PARADISE SINCE AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY. ONE FIVE OR SIX PARTNERS INCLUDING MYSELF HAVE LOST EVERYTHING THEY POSSESSED THE NEXT SOCKET THEY HAD WAS HOW DO WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PATIENTS. NATURAL CONSUMER ADVOCACY. I BELIEVE ALL AMERICAN BOARD OF PHYSICIANS ALONG VERY CAREER. EXPERIENCE IS A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR SPECIALIST. INSURER OF NONINVASIVE CARDIOVASCULAR AND OSHER STUDIES SURGICAL ASSISTANT LEADER MEDICAL GROUP FOR TWENTY YEARS AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF A REAL HEALTH CLINIC FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. I HAVE HELD LEADERSHIP POSITIONS ARE HOSPITAL IN COUNTY STATE AND NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS ON MANY LEVELS ALL OF THESE EXPERIENCES HAVE GIVEN ME GREAT INSIGHT INTO A PHYSICIAN'S ACTIVITY AND BEHAVIOR AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE DIFFICULT JUNCTIONS.

BUT ALSO ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ADVOCATED- I'M GENERALLY AGREED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RESPOND BUT THERE'S BEEN A FEW CASES WERE ADVOCATE FOR MORE SEVERE DISCIPLINE. I VOTED FOR A FEE INCREASE FOR ALL LICENSEES MEDICAL BOARD INCLUDING PHYSICIANS AND VIABLE REVENUE THE REASON IT COMES FROM PHYSICIANS. IF YOU INCREASE IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY FOR THE WORK OF THE BOARD TO PROTECT THE HEALTH. OF CONSUMERS AND TO ENSURE THE LICENSING AND REGULATION. POSITIONS IS NOT APPROPRIATELY. I AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACT WITHOUT BY JUDGE FAIRLY. PROTECTIONS AND DISCIPLINE PHYSICIANS WHO FAIL THEIR NATION'S.

WHAT STEPS ARE YOU TAKING AS WE GO FORWARD- IS AN EDUCATION PROGRAM WITH OUR PHYSICIANS ARE.

AND WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO THE FORE THAT HELP US RING THAT A HAND BECAUSE IT IS NOT. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE ESPECIALLY WITH THE US. THE SYNTHETIC OPIOID FENTANYL BEING LIFESTYLE I'M KIND OF. IN OUR PUTTING PUTTING PUT INTO SOME OF THE VERY IMPORTANT DRUGS THAT HELP WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT HAS SEVERAL. SOLO I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU ON THIS BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ME AND DURING MY SENATE TOP. TRIM HERE THANK YOU SENATOR LET'S GO IN THE SAME ORDER IF THAT'S OKAY- DOCTORS DOCTOR. GOOD IDEA DO YOU WANT TO START AND THEN WE'LL GO TO A DOCTOR MAHMOUD. AND DOCTOR TO WORK IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER. YES MARTIN SURE SENT RATES I THINK IT'S AN EXTRA. OF THIS AND YOU MANAGE DAHLE THE- OUR- ACTIONS RETAIN KERR. OF COURSE WE DID WAS MY AGE THAT THE Q. ARE IS MANDATE POSITIONS TO SEE A GREAT DEPRESSION IS GOOD- THE MEDICARE FROM OUR DAHLE. SO GREATER MY PRESCRIPTION AND- AND THEN THE YOU MAY THAT THE SORT OF THE PROJECT WE FOLLOWING HUNDRED PLUS PEOPLE WHO BARBARA GOING TO BE A GOOD PART ABOUT DAYS. YEAH I WAS DEPARTMENTS I WAS UNDER WE CENTER TO OUR. YOUR ARE KNOWN OF THE ACTUALLY TAKING ACTION SO HE- WHO DO NOT FOLLOW. IT MANAGEMENT. TO PAY MANAGE GUIDE OF WHAT FORMER BY. VICE AREN'T GOING TO MAKE ALSO SO THERE ARE GOING TO THE NEW TO FOLLOW. AND IF YOU LOOK ARE AT BE PRESCRIPTION DRUG. DOES ARE INCREASED. RIGHT NOW OUR BUSY HIS AMERICAN THAT THESE IDEAS USE. UNFORTUNATELY VERY LOT OF THROUGH MEXICO THROUGH THE LEGAL FOR. ELITE FOR HER THIS CALL THROUGH AND BE DANGER REGARD THESE. YOU BE TWICE AS AS MARK ARE COULD BE HAN TIME AS POWERFUL AND MARK. HALL WAS. SO SIMPLE FOR TO KNOW ALL BLACK STRING OFF FROM ILLEGALS ANOTHER DECADE SO YOU KIND OF THERE FOR. I THAT I ACT PRESENT THE BORDER EVEN WITH THE D.

SO THAT THE BURDEN DOES NOT FALL- ON DR GET AN IDEA OF COMPLETELY SO- DOCTOR MOVE GO AHEAD. AND IT IS THANK YOU I. TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS THE MOST BURNING YOU SHOW NOT IN JUST CALIFORNIA. IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. WHAT YOU'RE SEEING EVERY DAY IT IS JUST THAT. IS HEARTENING- BOUTIQUE IS VERY SERIOUSLY IN LOSS BOARD MEETING WE INVITED DAY- ONE NATIONAL FIGURE ON PAIN MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SURE EVEN OTHER BOARD MEMBERS. ARE WELL EDUCATED ABOUT PAIN MANAGEMENT. DOCTOR GOOD IDEA OF THAT- SAID WELL. THAT THE PROBLEM IS TWO WAYS NUMBER ONE IS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OTHER NONPRESCRIPTION THE CALLED STREET DRUG WHAT THIS DISTRICT RUGS- I THINK GUILDS DAD. SYSTEM WHERE WE CAN CHECK IS PATIENTS TAKING FROM WITH MANY HOW MANY OF THE POSITIONS OF PROVIDERS THAT CAN MANAGEMENT SO WE CAN KEEP AN EYE ON THAT. AND DEATH CERTIFICATE PROGRAM DEFINITELY HAS GIVEN US- MORE LEEWAY. TO KEEP A HOLD ON THAT BUT- I THINK THE PROBLEM IS MUCH BIGGER THAN JUST THESE COUPLE OF PROGRAM I THINK WE NEED TO GET ON BOARD COMMUNITY AND HAVE SOME EDUCATION PROGRAM AND THE CHILDREN WERE TRYING TO GET A DOCTOR THE TOTAL PEOPLE WHO DO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT. EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND I THINK THERE IS A AND- A IN MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT FOR ALL THE CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST DOING THE PAIN MANAGEMENT OR ANYTHING ELSE THEY NEED TO HAVE A MORE AGGRESSIVE TRAINING. AND THEY NEED TO PINPOINT THOSE PEOPLE. AND IN WELL AHEAD OF TIME BECAUSE- LOT OF PEOPLE WHO GET ADDICTED. TO THE PAIN MANAGEMENT OF PAIN DRUGS- USUALLY ON THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF PROBLEM WE JUST SURGERY OF FRACTURED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OFF OF THE TO GET ON THAT. AND ULTIMATELY THEY GOT ON THE STREET DOT SO I THINK PROBLEM IS VERY CRITICAL SKILLS IS A VERY GOOD JOB EXAMPLE DEATH CERTIFICATE IS REALLY GOING. COMMUNITY EDUCATION IS REALLY GOING. TO BE THE ID- TEACHING ON BOARD. AND ALL OF THE ORGANIZATION WHO. ARE PLAYING PARTY COMMITTEE. SHOULD ALSO BE IN LAW. AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ONE OF THE LEAD. BUT I ALSO TO GATHER WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROBLEM IS AT LEAST. BACK TOWARD IF NOT GETTING WORSE. THANK YOU YOUR THANK YOU DR THORPE ANYTHING TO ADD- THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT WE ARE AS A BOARD WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE BOARD MEETING. TOMORROW FRIDAY IN PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING TOMORROW ON FRIDAYS WERE ACTUALLY CONSIDERING- UPDATED SET OF PRESCRIBING GUIDELINES- ASKING BASS I THINK THE LAST TIME WE UPDATED THE GUIDELINES IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND SO WORK- THANK YOU SEE THAT GO FORWARD. THE BOARD HAS ALSO TAKEN A- A PROACTIVE STANCE IN THIS IN THAT. THERE WERE- THERE WAS. SOME THE BOARD ON. DRUGS ARE PRESCRIBING AND- HOW TO HOW TO FACILITATE- THAT COMBINATION EDUCATE PATIENTS EDUCATING EDUCATING PHYSICIANS ON. THE TRY AND PREEMPT AND NOT CONTINUE TO TURNTHAT THE SHIP I THINK WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS- THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT I'M ONE THING WOULD SAY AS A CAUTION IS THAT. ARE YOU GUYS TAKING CARE OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN PAIN WHO HAVE. BEEN REQUIRING- COMPLEX APPROACH. BOTH IN THE ROLE OF CLINIC PRIMARILY THE ROLE OF BUT ALL IN MY PRIVATE PRACTICE AND CURRENTLY WERE IN DANGER OF IT I'LL BE MAKING ITS SOUL- SO SOCIALLY DISTASTEFUL FOR THESE PEOPLE TO BE TO GO TO THE PHARMACY AND CAN PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION. THAT IS IT WE'RE WE'RE IN DANGER OF ACTUALLY HARMING SOME PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND- MEDICATION FOR ANY KIND OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND BE ABLE TO DO THEIR ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AND FUNCTION AS A FUNCTIONING ADULT SO I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW CLEARLY RUNNING VERY GOOD PASS AYE AYE MY GOAL IS TO TRY TO. ENSURE THAT WE ARE- DOING ALL THESE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WRONG PEOPLE DON'T GET THE MEDICATIONS. BUT STILL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM ARE NOT- THE DISCOURAGED BECAUSE THEY ARE MEETING UP THESE CONVOCATIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL ALL OF YOU FOR THE RESPONSE ON THAT AND CERTAINLY I TOTALLY AGREE DOCTOR FOR WE NEED A BALANCE BECAUSE PAIN MANAGEMENT IS STILL VERY IMPORTANT TO QUALITY OF LIFE ABSOLUTELY THAT PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT CANNOT CERTAINLY GET IT IS JUST KEEPING IT IN THE RIGHT HANDS AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PERHAPS OVERPRESCRIBING FOR THE WRONG REASONS AND THEY GET BETTER EDUCATION SO THAT SOME VERY GOOD NEWS THAT YOU HAVE A NEW SET OF GUIDELINES AND WHEN YOU CAN SHARE A LITTLE SIDE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE WE HAVE A SIMILAR LEGISLATION COMING THROUGH AND IF YOU HAVE IDEAS THAT MIGHT HELP US RATHER THAN REGULATION I MEAN LEGISLATION MAYBE I DON'T THINK WITH SOME OF THE REGULATIONS- WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BUT THANKS AGAIN AND I'LL I'LL I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES BUT TO ALL OF YOU LIKE AGAIN I'LL CONGRATULATE YOU AND THANK YOU GREAT APPRECIATION FOR STEPPING FOR. ONBOARD BEHIND NOT AN EASY SERVICE YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES AND CERTAINLY ARE YOU PEOPLE LETTING YOU AND PEOPLE SOME LIKE SOME DON'T LIKE YOU VERY MUCH THAT TRUMP THE OUTSIDE PART OF THE JOB SO THANK YOU AGAIN AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUNG OP YOU WERE. APPOINTMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR BATES I'M GONNA START WITH YOU MR MAJORITY LEADER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ON. I WOULD AGREE WITH MICHAEL- CENTER SAYING IT'S NOT A EASY SIR LIFE YOU ALL FOR- YOU WILLING JUST TO STEP UP IN. A DOCTOR THORPE BY INSPIRED BY YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU LOVE BEING A DOCTOR. IT'S A GOOD THING. WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S ONLY A HANDFUL OF US. THAT ARE ELECTED TO CREATE THE LEGISLATURE IN A SMALLER HANDFUL WHICH IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS SO IN ORDER TO RUN THIS GREAT STATE. WE DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY WE'VE COME UP WITH A WAY TO DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY TO FOLKS WHO WILL STEP UP. AND FALLEN MOST INSTANCES LIKE YOU ARE SUBSTANTIALLY VOLUNTEERING YOUR TIME TO HELP US. TO HAVE HAVE A LAYER BETWEEN. THE GOVERNMENT AND- AND A GROUP OF FOLKS THAT ARE EXPERTS THE GREAT CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH RESPECT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH YOUR BOARD AND WHETHER IT'S- ARCHITECTURE PHARMACISTS OR WHATEVER. IT IS THAT- WE WERE TRYING TO AS WAS INDICATED- TO OFFER SOME LEVEL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. THERE'S A TENSION THAT EXISTS BETWEEN GETTING THE EXPERTISE ON THE ONE HAND EACH OF YOUR EXPERTS IN YOUR FIELD. AND THE BALANCE WHERE IT'S NOT PROTECTIONISM OF THE INDUSTRY OR THE PROFESSION AND HAS A LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY. TO THE CONSUMERS. AND SO THE REASON I THINK THAT SENATOR BATES TALKED ABOUT HER IT'S NOT EASY SERVE BECAUSE IN THIS AREA OF PUBLIC POLICY IS QUITE DIFFICULT. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THAT REGARD. KERN IN TERMS OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AS WE DO WITH THAT DELICATE BALANCE WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO US WHICH ARE JUST A HANDFUL OF ELECTED FOLKS. WHO ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC- AND WE DELEGATE THAT AUTHORITY YOU. AND I WANNA START WITH A- DOCTOR. UGH GOING INTO THAT DAY HAVE- WHO'S BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR TEN YEARS. I'M INFORMED. THAT THE AVERAGE. TIME FROM THE RECIPIENT OF A COMPLAINT. FROM A DOCTOR THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION TO THE ISSUANCE OF FORMAL DISCIPLINE. IS NINE HUNDRED DAYS. THE UNDERSTAND THEIR SERIES OF EXCUSES AND PROCESS SEASON COMPLEXITIES I SERVED ON THE BOARD OF PHARMACY SOME THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU HAVE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL DETERMINE GENERAL'S A LAWYER AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES. BUT HERE YOU BEEN ON THIS BOARD FOR TEN YEARS SAID YOUR TESTIMONY. AND I WANNA GET YOUR THOUGHTS AS TO WHY THAT'S THE CASE THIS CERTAINLY IS A SAID YOU IN THE INTERVIEW HAVING A PATIENT WAITING IN YOUR WAITING ROOM FOR NINE- DAYS WOULD NOT BE DEEMED AS SATISFACTORY EXPERIENCE. WE NEED TO HAVE TRUST IN THE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO HAVE THE PUBLIC HAVE TRUST IN OUR PROCESS AND WHEN SOMETHING TAKES SO LONG IT CERTAINLY RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON SO QUESTION IS YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT'S GONE BEFORE. AND ALSO IF YOU SEE ANY ROAD MAPS FORWARD TO SHORTEN THAT TIME SO WE CAN BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO N. AND RESPONSIVE. TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE ALL REPRESENT. SO THAT WORK TO THE DOCTOR GOING ON AT. THE GENERAL YEAH BY. YEAH HE'S BEEN. FOR HIS ORDERS FOR VERY I AGREE YOUR DAD I GIVEN LIKE MY CHRISTIAN GREY MY VERY RULES NINE. A CREATED BY STEVE SOMEBODY JUST THEY CAN BE BE SEEN. SO YOU USE ON A ON THERE ARE NOW EVEN THOUGH ARE NOT GROWN UP ALL THE SNOW 470% THE COMPANY THAT WITHIN BODIES ALL WITHIN. ONE YEAR. I KNOW YOU YOU. COMPLY AND LEGAL CASE THE PERSON OF CASES FROM. SIXTY SEVENTEEN SO. EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX FOR FEW DAYS 18% COOPER. EARNED SEVENTY NAY IT'S FIVE POINT. EIGHT FOR. I'M BEATING EASTERN NINE PERSON SO DO HAVE A FROM- LIKE. NOT NINE HUNDRED DAYS BUT- IT'S COMPLEX FRAUD- WILL FROM THE MANY COMES. TO H. Q. YOU DID YOU SAW. COULD BE OPERATED SO TURNING THIS- THE- I KNOW I SHOULD LARGER THEIR MARKET. SO FOR EXAMPLE PROCESS WHICH GO THROUGH AND WE ARE. GOING TO LOOKING HOW DO YOU IMPROVE. THIS YOU BE LOOKING BACK TO WHEREAS SO THINGS- TO MAKE THE PROCESS AGENTS ONE OF WE. BURGER BAKER AS AND- BEDROOM AND WILL YOU BETWEEN EXTREME ON MY OR SO THAT CAN MOVE. ATTRIBUTES HI LEVEL THE FUN FOR. ALL AND GO- DO YOU FOR AND THE HE AND PHYSICIAN DOES NOT. ADDRESS FOR TO THE MEDICAL RIGHT IN TIME AND THOUSAND. THOUSAND PER DAY FOR ALL TO TEN DOLLARS ALSO ASKING THE COST REIMBURSEMENT SO THERE IS A COST REIMBURSEMENT THE ATTORNEYS DON'T. TO REALLY TAKE THESE CASES SO WE'RE ASKING A LOT OF THINGS WE NEED YOUR HELP. OUR GOAL IS TO SHORTEN YOUR. AS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU SIR A MANAGER FORMER CO PLAY YEAH WAS GOING TO ASK THE ISSUE BUT THE OPEN BUT I THINK THAT'S PROPERLY ANSWERED I THIS IS BASE. FOR BUT THIS IS TOO DARK THORPE. A TOOTH. SO CALIFORNIA. BUREAU'S OF THAT LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN DOCTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE COMPLAINTS INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS AGAINST THEM. HOW ARE YOU OR HOW'S THE BOARD. ENSURING THAT AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO DOCTORS ARE NOT BEING UNAIRLY PUNISHED IN THIS PROCESS AND I KNOW. THE DISTANCE IN THE BILL IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IT WAS REFERENCE TO THE QUESTION. BUT IF YOU CAN DRILL A LITTLE DEEPER ON THAT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US CONFIDENCE. THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR. THANK YOU DOCTOR. THANK YOUCENTERS WERE. YES BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR- EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT SEEMS SHORTER THAN THAT SOMEHOW BUT- THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. AND YOU KNOW IS PART OF THAT INITIATION PART OF THAT- TRAINING TO BE ON THE BOARD- IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING WAS PART OF THAT- BEFORE. YOU KNOW BEFORE WE COULD PROCEED WITH THE- THE OLD RECALL OF COURSE- WE GOT A BAD COLD IDEA OF BOARD TRAINING ON IMPLICIT BIAS OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT THE EAGLES STATE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION EIGHT ASSOCIATION OF. PHYSICIANS OF COLOR- CAME TO US AND SAID LOOK THERE'S A WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WE LISTEN TO HER AND WE DON'T HAVE. TAKEN OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WOULD BE A CLUE TO THE REVIEWERS AS TO WHAT THE BACKGROUND OF THE PHYSICIAN IS- SUCH AS THEIR WE DON'T LIST OF PEOPLE SCHOOL ANYMORE OR THE TRAINING PROGRAMS OF THE WARRANT BEFORE OR DID THE TRADE PROGRAMS THEY WORK THE CDVA. PART THANKS SO I THINK THE A- THE OF PEOPLE THERE ARE THE BOARD. CURRENTLY ARE. FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF. EQUANIMITY AND EQUALITY IN TERMS OF NOT DISADVANTAGING ANY. ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER TO YOU WHETHER IT'S PHYSICIAN OR PATIENT FOR THAT MATTER BUT- I THINK THERE IS- YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS MORE WE CAN DO OF COURSE- BUT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE OPEN TO ANY ANY OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE THAT THERE IS A REAL FOCUS ON ON TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT- DECISIONS OF COLOR NOT ON. OUR INAPPROPRIATE LEAD- DISCIPLINED THANK YOU SO MUCH. IS THAT ALL ARE YOU SURE OKAY BUT A LITTLE OKAY WE WOMEN WOMEN RE DIRECT AFTER MR VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM AND I WANT TO COMMEND YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG HAS QUITE ELOQUENT. LAYING OUT JUST HOW DIFFICULT THESE JOBS ARE- SO WE WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL THREE OF YOU ON YOUR APPOINTMENT- I JUST I JUST I HAVE ACTUALLY A FEW QUESTIONS SO- BACK IN DECEMBER AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT. ZOOM CALL WITH THE COUPLE FROM MY DISTRICT WHO LOST A CHILD AND ULTIMATELY ENDED UP FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD NO NO I CAN GO TO A LOT OF DETAILS HERE BECAUSE I KNOW LATER IN THIS YEAR WE'RE HAVING SUNSET REVIEW THE MEDICAL BOARD MAYBE- I WILL DO IT AT THAT TIME. BUT I DO WANT TO RAISE A NUMBER OF. QUESTIONS AND BASED UPON THAT CONVERSATION AND LIKE TO GET YOUR GUISES RESPONSE. THE FIRST ONE HOW CAN THE BOARD IMPROVE THE COMPLAINT PROCESS TO ALLOW FOR REAL TIME STATUS UPDATES OF THE COMPLAINT. AND PROVIDE A PRIMARY CONTACT ALONG WITH CONTACT INFORMATION. I DON'T I DON'T SEE A WHOEVER WANTS TO. I DON'T MIND HERE FROM ALL THREE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS TIME TIME CONCERNED SO MAYBE. ONE OF YOU TAKE THAT ONE WOULD BE GREAT MISTER MAHMOUD LOOKS LIKE HE'S- RECORD ONE BECAUSE I DON'T OF WORK OUT OF THEM OTHER THINGS- THAT IS A REAL CONCERN THAT'S WHAT I SAID IN MY OPENING STATEMENT TO AND THAT IS. FOLLOWED RELAUNCH CONCERN ON THE BEHALF OF THE MONTH. AND WE NEED TO DO MORE WORK ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN IMPROVING. EDUCATE PEOPLE EDUCATE CONSUMERS CALIFORNIANS. IF THERE'S A PROBLEM IF THERE'S AN ISSUE HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN REACH. OUT TO BOARD. AND THIS SHOULDBE IN THE SYSTEM I THINK IS A SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT I THINK RESPONSE TIMES SLOWER. HOW QUICKLY BOARD CAN WORK ON THAT COMPLAIN OF RIGHT THIS SHOULD BE A TIME LIMIT. THAT BOARD GET BACK FOR THE FAMILY. UNEXPECTED THE CONSUMER. HARPER THAT NUMBER IS. AND THAT THE SHOULD HAVE READ YOU MENTION YOU'RE PROFITABLY LIVE UP IT MEANS THAT ON A WEEKLY ON A- BI WEEKLY BASIS GIVEN THE UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING WHEN WE GOT. THAT WOULD NOT ONLY SATISFY THE CONSUMER THAT IS ALSO IS GOING TO INCREASE THE TRUST IN THE CONSUMER YES THE SYSTEM IS WORKING PEOPLE ARE WORKING AND ARE ALSO ALERTED THE BOARD MEMBERS. AND THEY WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE THING YES AND ALSO STAFF OF THE BOARD I THINK STEP INSTRUMENT AS A VITAL TO CONSTITUTIONAL BOARDING GREAT BUT DO NEED TO STAY ON ALERT OKAY YOU'LL BE LOOKING SYSTEM WE GOT IMPORTANT SOMEBODY'S- BROTHER SISTER MOTHER FATHER SON OR DAUGHTER OF A NEIGHBOR. HAD JUST MISSED HAVE HAPPENED AND WE'RE NOT GETTING AND IF WE WILL WAIT FOR MONTHS AND YEARS. SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE A SEAT ANSWER SO WE NEED TO REALLY GET MORE RELAXED AND- MEANS THERE SHOULD BE NO TIME FOR YOUR SET ON BACK AND- MY PLAN IS TO. AND REALLY IT JUST MEETING OUR NEXT MEETING OF THE BOARD TO MOVEUP THIS THING AND I HAVE SOME HOMEWORK DONE AND- IT- BEING ILLEGAL A- SAN. PROCESS IN BURN SO. PEOPLE HAVE TRUST IN BOOK. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL TO ON ON THE- YOU KNOW THAT THE- IS VERY TO THE PROCESS IS SO. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD STAFF DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER- THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY CONTROL OR ANY UPDATES FROM EACH YOU ARE YOU WHO'S DOING THE INVESTIGATION THEY THEY DON'T ALWAYS HAVE UP TODAY REPORTS ON WHAT. THE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IS DOING- IF IT GOES TO THE MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGE THEN THAT'S EVEN MORE SO. EVEN THOUGH WE WERE WE CAN BE VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT UPDATING FROM OUR STAFF AND HAVING A CONTACT PERSON THE STAFF TO UPDATE. THE COMPLAINT. IT IT MADE BE VERY. BECAUSE A LOT OF WE DON'T WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT COMPLAINT AND WOULD HAVE TO. YOU KNOW SO WE I THINK BUILDING IN ABOUT MORE INTEGRATED- WORKING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE DEPARTMENTS AT THE MEDICAL BOARD DEPENDS ON. BUT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROL OVER ISN'T IT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF STREAMLINING THIS PROCESS. AND THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT I THINK EVEN GETTING BACK TO THE FAMILY SAYING WE DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE THIS WEEK I THINK I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL IN TERMS OF- BUILDING CONFIDENCE AND TRUST. SO THIS IS FOR DOCTOR COULD NOT ADD- WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON- WANT TO SENATOR HERTZBERG'S QUESTION SO- HE ASKED YOU ABOUT THE TIME LINE AND I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE YOU'VE ANSWERED THAT. SO IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS- THE COUPLE THAT. I MET WITH- THERE V. VICTIMS THIS AND THEY WERE NEVER INTERVIEWED AT ALL REGARDING THE SUBMITTAL THE COMPLAINT. IS THAT IS THAT STANDARD PROCEDURE NOT YET DOT INTERVIEW THOSE AT A FILE AND IT AND IF AND IF SO WHY- THANK YOU FOR ASKING- NO IT'S NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE ACTUALLY THE STAFF INVESTIGATORS. DURING AN INTERVIEW I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED HERE I THINK WE COULD TO ASK. BY THREE BILLION TRIVIAL- AT THE FAMILIES AND ALSO ON B. AND B.

DELAY YOU'LL HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTION IS GOING ON SO THAT THEY MAHLER STAFF CAN INFORM THE FAMILIES THERE TO GAYS SO.

SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WHO FOR PHYSICIANS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN ANY KIND OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR WERE USING ANY KIND OF- SOLUTIONS AN INAPPROPRIATELY- IT IS PHYSICALLY IN THOSE CASES WERE THESE WERE THOUGHT IT FELT TO BE SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL HARM FOR PATIENTS. IF THEY WISH THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THEY MIGHT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY CHOSE ANOTHER DOCTOR- I THANK I DO. YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH THIS HI I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF. REQUIRING EVERY PROBATIONARY DR TO BE COMMITTED TO THE AFTER DEATH DISCLOSE ACT TO THEIR- TO THEIR PATIENTS NOT THAT I HATE NOT THE PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THE ACCESS THEY DO IF THEY GO ON THE MEDICAL MORE WEBSITE THAT'S CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE MEDICAL OR WEBSITE- BUT UP FRONT WHEN SOMEBODY IS- ACTUALLY ESTABLISHING A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU. IT IS VERY CHILLING. WHO TO SOME PEOPLE- TO SEE WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON WATER WHAT'S YOUR PROBATION ABOUT I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT'S NOT A- BAD IDEA THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHAT I AM SAYING I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE AREFUL ABOUT. WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE OF DOING THAT. AND THANK YOU. THEY'RE GETTING MORE AND THE OTHER TWO. AND THEN I'M DONE AT THAT POINT IN APPROACH AND THAT'S FINE DR YES GO AHEAD- THANK YOU FOR REAL SO WE ACTUALLY WE WORKED QUITE GOOD BASED ON NATION'S NOTIFICATION FROM THE PROBATIONARY POSITION STATE SENATOR HILL AND THE ASSEMBLY HERE AND HE DID REALLY COME OFF THE. DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS. THE GROUP TRANCERS ACTUALLY DOCTOR TO GET THEM ON ALL ORDERS TELL THEM WHAT OF ALL. FOR THE REST OF THE PROGRAM IS ALREADY ON LIST. AND READ THE ORDER.

AND- I EVERYTHING IS ON THE ROPES- IF BAY IF THAT CAN PROMOTED- THEN WE CAN TO THE NEXT STEP THE BOB NORTHEAST BE DONE I AM A PLUG TRUSTED. EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO COME SEE A DOCTOR HONESTLY THAT IS THE MOST SEGREGATION STRIP AND PATIENTS SHOULD KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT DR NOT ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE BUT ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING PROFESSIONALLY AND WHAT HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LIFE AND DEATH. HELLO MY NAME DENIS THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT TO GO OVER THERE AND I'M FIVE EIGHT IT.

OF BASED ON THEIR CATEGORY BUT I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AT THE GRANULAR LEVEL WHETHER IT'S OPIOIDS OR DIVERSITY. OR RESPONSE TIME AND I THINK I WOULD LIKE O ASK EACH OF YOU A MORE GLOBAL QUESTION THAT PULLS IT ALL TOGETHER WHICH IS THAT I THINK THERE'S THE CONCERN. THAT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS TO BE AN HONEST BROKER THAT IS NOT CAPTURED IN SOME WAY BY THE INDUSTRY. AND SO HOW WOULD EACH OF YOU SPEAK TO THAT CONCERN AND HOW YOU WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH REGARD TO YOUR SERVICE TO YOUR POTENTIAL SERVICE AND I DON'T I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR I DON'T KNOW WHAT ORDER WILL GO AGAIN RIGHT NOW DR THORPE DO YOU WANT TO.

POSITION AS WELL BUT I THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW. I AM NOW A WHOLE- FOREVER YOU KNOW KIND OF. UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. IS NOT- NOT TRUE HEY DON'T TALK TO THEM REGULARLY AND THEY DON'T TALK TO ME REGULARLY. AND MY HE- MY ROLE IS AS AN ADVOCATE FOR CONSUMERS IT IS REALLY TIED WITH MY ROLE AS A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR.

AND ITS ITS PRIORITIES AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. AND I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THAT EITHER I'M. HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE QUESTIONS THAT THEY'VE ANSWERED- I THINK THIS IS- A REALLY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION- YOU KNOW I READ ALL OF THE LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVED IN SUPPORT AND THE OBVIOUSLY THE- OPPOSITION AND THE SUPPORT AND- NO DOUBT WHEN WE GO TO PUBLIC. COMMENT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE PHONE OR HERE IN SUPPORT AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION. I THINK THE RULES COMMITTEE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A PREVIEW OF THAT WHEN WE TOOK UP THE APPOINTMENT OF THE- I DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS BECAUSE- THAT DIRECTORS OF FORMER. EXECUTIVE TO THE MEDICAL BOARD SO WE HAD A PREVIEW OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS WHICH IS PROBABLY THE NATURE OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY. I GUESS AND I THINK I WAS GONNA. BASICALLY I ASK YOU ABOUT THE BALANCE OF- THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE MEDICAL BOARD. FIVE AND HOW YOU BALANCE THAT WITH- YOUR JOB AS PHYSICIANS ARE AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE- YOUR PEERS WHO MAY END UP BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE COMPLAINTS BUT I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASK OUR- A GOOD NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU IS DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO DO APPROPRIATE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN I LOOK AT- THE RUN DOWN I'VE BEEN AND TO MY COLLEAGUE THE MAJORITY LEADER'S QUESTION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DAYS AND- AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO INVESTIGATE DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE BOARD HAS. ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR THE EXPERTISE IN LEVEL OF SKILL OF YOUR INVESTIGATORS AND THEN- AS THOSE CASES PROCEED FORWARD I TAKE- GIVE OR TAKE I WILL TRY TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS. AB ELEVEN THOUSAND OR SO COMPLAINTS YOU OVERSEE THE LICENSES OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND. POSITIONS AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE COMPLAINTS HOW THEY PERCEIVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM YOU REALLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF THOSE UNTIL UNTIL THEY REACH A LEVEL THAT THEY COME. TO YOUR PANELS- DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT THE BOARD HAS THE- EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY. HAVE THE INVESTIGATIONS- BE DONE THOROUGHLY WHEN YOU SEE THOSE CASES COME BEFORE YOU UP AGAINST MAYBE. MEDICAL EXPERTS OF THE DEFENDANTS WHO COME BEFORE YOU CAN YOU JUST EACH OF YOU AND I'LL START WITH YOU DR THORPE. WELL ACTUALLY DR AGAIN ON A DAY OF YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR TEN YEARS SO. LET ME START WITH YOU- BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN THERE LONGER I WOULD JUST ASK DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO DO THE KIND OF INVESTIGATION. THROUGH TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. BEFORE THEY COME TO YOU. ARE RUMORED CHAIR OUR- RESOURCES FIRST WHEN I DON'T TALK ABOUT WOULD BE THE BILL'S. ARE WE ARE ASKING IN THE SUNSET LEGISLATIVE PASSED THE INCREASE THE DEALERS TO SELL ON ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS DOLLAR LICENSE FEE GOING FROM SEVEN EIGHTY THREE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE BUT OUR COST WENT UP WITH BOTH H. P- YOU'LL AND- AND DID YOU SELL WHOSE AGES OFFICE WHEN THE BY 40% SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THERE SO WE DO WE DO WHEN OF THOSE. TO THE SUNSET. CARE LEGISLATION COMES FONG- AS FAR AS- THE PART NAY ARE D. I. D. LEVEL. WE'RE ALSO ASK. YOU TO HELP US TO. ALL OF HOURS TO GET. B. R. RT TH GRADE AND UP. DATES THESE ARE BEING BY TRICKS IMPORTANT. FOR OUR STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY INFORM. ON A INFORMED THE- ASIAN CENTER FOR. ARE GOING TO COME STRAIGHT AMERICANS. I THINK THIS IS RELATED STRATEGY THE COMBINATION BOARD THEIR YOUNG PHYSICIANS AND- PUBLIC MEMBERS SO I QUITE A NUMBER OF TIMES ARE YOU I EXPLAINED TO PEOPLE AS- AS A TEACHER- FOR A FORTY YEARS TRAINING GIRL PEOPLE I CAN EXPLAIN. MAJORITY OF THE CASES PROVIDED TO MY FAMILY MEMBERS. ARE USUALLY. MAJORITY OF THE TIME. I ALL RIGHT ALONG WITH THE OTHER FOODS ARE THE ONE WHO ARE PUSH FOR DISCIPLINE. COMPARED TO OUR DAILY JAY CAME UP WITH OUR WATER STIPULATION OUR OWN STAFF PROVIDED SO. LITTLE THAT WOULD BIGGEST RESOURCE NEARLY AS OUR NUMBER ONE IS OUT FINANCES NUMBER TO USED IT WILL BE A PART OF OUR STAFF TO GET THERE AND GET. BORED BORED. IF YOU KNOW YOUR NAY HE SOPHISTRY HE SEEMS VERY BEING INVESTIGATION IS ATTENDING YOUR PARTNER FIRM ARTIFICIAL ROCKET SCIENCE BECAUSE- IN THIS AGE RETIRED THINGS. ARE CHRONIC. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE PERFECT PRIVACY I THINK SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET. THANK YOU DR THORPE LET ME ASK YOU NEXT. THANK YOU. ON DOG DOG HAS JUST HIT ON THE L. THE THERE'S A REALLY THERE'S A STRUCTURAL. WITH THE- STUFF OF MOTHER WARD- WE- WELL THE- OUR REACH IN TERMS OF REVENUE ARE BASED ON LICENSING FEES AND WE ARE SORT OF HELD CAPTIVE BY- AGENCIES WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER RECENTLY- I'M- INTERESTING THE DIFFERENT NOTCHING THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER THE NEXT- FEES FROM THE H. U. I. U. NH AND THE INVESTIGATION UNIT. AT ALSO FEATURE RETURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE AND THAT IS- YOU KNOW THERE'S A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT RIGHT NOW WE WILL BE BANKRUPT IN ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND WE ONLY HAVE A- TWO MONTH- BY FOR REALLY. ALL RIGHT NOW SO. THE MEDICAL BOARD. THEN THERE IS A IN DEPTH NEED TO INCREASE. BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE SOME OTHER THINGS DONE WITHIN THE STRUCTURE FINANCIALLY OF THE BOARD SO THAT THESE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS ARE ALLEVIATE IT AND- CALPERS AND THAT THERE'S EIGHT THE ABILITY OF THE MEDICAL BOARD TO HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO COMPLETE TO CONTINUE TO. PROVIDE GOOD QUALITY OF INVESTIGATIONS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT- OUR CONSULTANTS AND- THERE IS I THINK IT'S A REAL NEED TO ENCOURAGE- AREN'T. YOU KNOW GOOD QUALITY DOCTORS TO BE CONSULTANTS AND THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THERE'RE THEY ARE PAID OF COURSE BUT IT'S NOT IT'S VERY IT'S VERY YEAH HI AM SET. TIME- IT'S VERY. IT DOES A LOT OF GIVE ME SPENT IN REVIEWING. IN WAITING FOR RECORDS COME AND SO- BUT IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING RECORDS REVIEWING THE STANDARDS CARE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK BEING DONE BY THE CONSULTANTS AND- UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW WE WE'RE IT'S A IT'S A VOLUNTARY POOL THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT PEOPLE% HAVE TO BE CONSULTANTS- WITH A LIMITED POOL TO DRAW FROM. WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HADN'T MORE CONSULTANTS THAT WE COULD. DO WE COULD ACCESS YES WORK AND POSSIBLY INCREASING THE RESOURCES WILL- WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT AS WELL BUT- I THINK THE BIGGER ISSUES REALLY ARE ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL. PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY THE FINANCES ARE ARE MADE- SET UP IN THE MEDICAL BOARD UNDERSTOOD DR MAHMOUD ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO WHAT. EITHER HAVE SAID. WELL I THINK OF THE BODY SOMETHING ONLY BECAUSE THEY DAYS AND DOUBLE AND WEBER. IF YOU'LL JUST SUMMER SIXTY DAYS AND- INFUSING. AND COST SHARE FROM THE RESPONDENTS SPEND THAT THE CASE. WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- I WANTED TO COME UP AND REALLY CORD PROBLEM IS MONEY. YOU NEED TO HAVE RESOURCES THAT THAT IS SOURCES ARE BARRED BY A FINANCES. IF. YOU HIDE IN INVEST. AND YOUR OPINION SIR AMOUNT AND IF YOU CAN- CANNOT KEEP IT DOCKED OF THE- INDUSTRY. THAT INVESTIGATORS. YOU'RE DOING LEARN THINGS ON YOU. AND THEN YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE NEW PERSON IF YOU KEEP THEM AT IT. CERTAINLY THEY WERE NOT. ANY REST WHO DOING HIS JOB AND PLUS A YEAR IF IS THERE A THIRD YEAR IS WOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF. AND RELIABLE QUALITY. PAINTING THAT YOU HAVE EXPERT OPINIONS MEDICAL VOTE AGAINST US BUT WHEN HE AND A- LOWER LEVEL OF COST MADE AS DEFENDANT ON THE SPOT IS GOING TO COST. FIVE TIMES AND OBVIOUSLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SPENDING A LOT THAT'S WHY SOMEBODY WILL LOSE IT YES IT'S- STILL REALLY BOTTOM LINE IS. MORE RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE ADDRESSED IF WE CAN ADJUST THAT AND I THINK OF. THIS IS A READY TIMELY- ACTION BEING COMING AND- SENSITIVE YOU WHICH WILL COME TO YOU AND HOPEFULLY. THAT WILL HELP US. DO SOME GOOD RIGHT THANK YOU DR I WOULD THINK- YOU KNOW IT WAS IN TRYING TO GET TO. WHAT YOU'RE HANDED AS A BOARD TO REVIEW WHEN YOU ARE DEALING WITH AN INVESTIGATION. MEDICAL EXPERTS YOU CAN BE AT YOU KNOW IF THE DEFENDANT HAS MORE RESOURCES- YOU YOU'VE GOT AN IMBALANCE OF A SITUATION THERE. BEFORE SOMETHING IS PUT BEFORE YOU TO MAKE A DETERMINATION YOU'RE- YOU'RE GONNA I MEAN GRANTED THAT'S THE BENEFIT. HAVE AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT LEGAL EXPERTISE AN INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES- I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE ALL FACE THAT WHEN I WAS AT A CITY COUNCIL AND WE HAD CLOSED SESSION TO DEAL WITH LITIGATION. OUR CITY-ATTORNEYS WERE SOMETIMES OUT MANEUVERED- AS I LOOK AT OUR ATTORNEY. SO I I'M JUST I'M JUST- YES AS TO WHETHER THERE IS A FORM OF COST RECOVERY THAT WOULD ALLOW YOU BETTER EXPERTISE BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT FOR A MINUTE AND JUST- ASK ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE WE GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND WE WILL TAKE A BREAK AT THAT POINT SO THAT. OUR OUR STENOGRAPHER CAN. LET HER FINGERS- RELAX A BIT BUT- YOU HAVE AS A AS A BODY INTERNAL GUIDELINES FOR LEVELS OF DISCIPLINE. AND YOU FOLLOW THOSE GUIDELINES SO WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I MEAN I ASSUME I'M GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. YOU HAVE GUIDELINES FOR- THE TYPE OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION YOU CAN TAKE WHETHER SOMEONE IS ON. PROBATION. FOR THREE FIVE SEVEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR GUIDELINES ARE BUT- HOW OFTEN DO YOU- I MEAN DO YOU FOLLOW GUIDELINES AS OUTLINED IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION. OR DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO- CHANGE AND GIVE A LESSER. DISCIPLINARY ACTION OUTSIDE OF YOUR GUIDELINES AND DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW OFTEN YOU FOLLOW THOSE GUIDELINES STRICTLY OR WHETHER YOU. GIVE LESS OF A DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND DR MEHMOOD I WILL GO TO YOU FIRST AND LET YOU START THIS TIME. THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE BROAD DISPLAYING RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING OF YOUR STATEMENT. AND WHY WHACKED CHRISTIANS BRING MORE TO THE BOARD THEN OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S HEALTHCARE. AND SAME THING IS THE CASE WITH THAT. ARM MANY TIMES IT HAPPENS THAT PHYSICIANS BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE PRACTICING AND THEY KNOW THE PROBLEM EXACTLY AND THEY ARE ABLE TO PLAY PLAY TO THE KNEE LIKE MANY PLAY PLAY MEANS THAT FIND OUT EXACTLY WHY THIS HAPPENED A- LOT OF TIME WE COME UP AND BRING YOUR QUESTION WHY DOT FRESH MEN. ARE THAT IS THE LAW WHY DOES I GO TO IS LESS SHOULD BE BECAUSE THIS IS A MEDICAL THING AND I DON'T HAPPEN WHEN NOW YOU THINK THAT THIS IS A NORMAL THING WHICH HAPPENED NOT NORMAL THING BUT THIS IS A COMMON THING WHICH HAPPENED A COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU START. DEMANDING PEOPLE. BUT EVERY LITTLE THING THEN THERE'LL BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS. THE NEW. BUT IN OUR STATE IS THAT CONSUMER PROTECTION IS THE NUMBER ONE MISSION AND GOAL. AND THE SECOND THING IS PHYSICIAN ARE OR WHY DOES THE HAVE ADDITION SHOULD BE IN OUR MIND. AND SOMETIMES YOU CAN PLAY A LITTLE BIT WITH THAT AND YOU CAN COME UP WITH A BETTER DECISION MOST THE TIME WHEN I LOOK AT THAT I LOOK AT THE GUIDELINES AND I TRIED TO FOLLOW GUIDELINES SO THAT. I'M NOT TOO MUCH BY ITS BUT OBVIOUSLY OF BEING BOTH OF THESE THINGS THAT IS THIS WHAT IS HAPPENING IS UNUSUAL VERY UNUSUAL IT IS THE- TALK OF THE LANGUAGE AND THAT IS JUST AN ALL UNINTENTIONAL ERROR RATE SOMEBODY. DIDN'T GET HIRED SOMEBODY DIDN'T GET NEARLY- NINE DAMAGED BAG IS GETTING TO THINK SO THANKS IN MY OPINION THINGS READY BUT BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY TO DO YOU HAVE A STATE SOMETIME AND. SOMETIME UNDERSTANDABLE. THANK YOU I. YOUR WHOLE BECAUSE- NEXT SEE WHAT I DO THANK YOU DOT THORPE- YEAH I- SO WHAT I THINK DOCTOR WHO IS SAID IT WHAT WE KNOW WHAT ALL THAT- I THOUGHT I WOULD SAY NINETY FIVE TO NINETY. I WOULD BE A PROBABLY PANEL WILL FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE- OR THE- THE MINISTRY LAW JUDGE- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY- THEY'RE MUCH CLOSER TO THE CASE AND WE ARE WE REVIEW EVERY CASE- IN DETAIL BUT- GENERALLY YOU ARE WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S- THEIR EXPERTISE I THINK LOOKING BACK ON I'M JUST LOOKING AT- DOCUMENTS THAT. WERE PROVIDED TO ME BY THE STAFF AND IN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- THIS IS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE CASES. UNDER EIGHTY ONE DECISIONS THAT WERE ADOPTED WITHOUT CHANGE UP SIX DECISIONS THAT WERE- THE PENALTY REDUCED IN SOME WAY AND EIGHT TIMES AT THE BOARD VOTED TO INCREASE THE PENALTY IN SOME WAY- IN. IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE FORTY THREE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ADOPTIONS WITHOUT CHANGE. AND ONE EACH ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DECISIONS WAS. R. DECREASED AND ONE OF THEM WAS INCREASED SO IT'S- IT IS NOT VERY OFTEN THAT WE THAT WE CHANGE IT BUT WE DO HAVE WE DO FOLLOW THE DISHES ARE GUIDELINES THAT ARE THAT ARE ATTACHED TO EVERY CASE. THANK YOU DOCTOR. DR CONNECTIVE THERE ARE NONE OF YOUR LINES SO ACTUALLY THERE AND I THINK I COULD GO FOR FROM THE MOOD TO- IS HERE TO STAY COMPLETELY CLEARLY. WE DO FOLLOW THE DISAPPOINTED I HAD DIED LAST MOST OF THE TIME AND ENERGY- BECAUSE HE USES YOUR JOURNEY HERE SHE'S A DIRECTOR AND THEY USUALLY. ARE HE WAS. IF YOU DESCEND- I RECOMMENDED. HARDER JERRY FOR US TO SORRY. AND THERE ARE STILL CASES THIS IS WHERE CONSCIOUS I'M VERY. INTERESTING WITH YOUR- TIMES BOTH LONG. HOW FOR. ON THE- RATHER THAN WORK PEOPLE BY STAFF ON THE YOU SAW BY. THEN I DON'T HAVE OF THE TIME. THE AGENTS ARE THERE TO CAN A THAT THROUGH TOO BIG IF YOU DON'T TAKE A- THESE ARE THE MEETING FOR IT'S NOT JUST THE CARE SO YOU GOT TO FOLLOW SO THAT FALL THE ACTOR YEAH I SAW. WE'RE IF YOU DO- BOOK THE- B. A. R. YOUR DECISION. THROUGH THE SUNSET REVIEW AT OUR I BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE. COST RECOVERY PARTICULARLY IF THERE ARE AGREE JUST CASES WHERE VIOLATIONS ARE FOUND. I COULD BE ONE THING TO CONSIDER AND LOOK AT I.

EVERYTHING INCLUDING OUR FUTURE OR HELP UNFORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL JORDAN BOARD. MADE SURE THAT WE GOT NO JUSTICE BECAUSE OVER 95% OF COMPLAINTS ARE CLOSE WITHOUT ANY SORT OF. REACTION DURING THIS PROPERTY WAS ENDING AND THAT DESPITE BEING A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY THE CONSUMER IN THE LAST CONSIDERATION OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD EVEN THOUGH STEP CONSUMERS ACTUAL VICTIMS WILL HAVE THE MAIN HURT AND EVEN KILLED AT THE HANDS OF A FEW COURT DECISIONS.

I AM MORE HORRIFIED BY THE SELECTION OF DOCTOR FOR AMANDA HAVE PRESIDED OVER THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. HAS BEEN PART OF IT FOR ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY BUT IF DOCTOR START PLEASE THAT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD IS NOW A BRANCH OF THE LOBBYING GROUP THIRTY. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION APPOINTING HIM AS A BOARD MEMBER IT'S LIKE ASKING. THE RATHER START THE BANK. THE A CITY IS A- BECAUSE PERFECT NEED. IT ALLOWS SEVERAL DOCTORS HARM OVER AND OVER AGAIN. CALIFORNIANS OF ALL WALKS OF. BUT AUTHORED BREAK THE MOST. WHEN THEY- ARE SO THAT THE ONLY CHOICE. PETER TO UNDER COMMUNITIES. THE ONLY BIG.

AND ANY PLACE OF THE APPOINTMENT FOR AND I. YOU TO SEND THANK YOU. MA'AM THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLAY. THANK YOU MEADOW COME FROM TO EIGHT YOUR IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS UNDER AS AN I'M FROM THE AREA I'M GONNA COUNTY. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK SENATOR WILK FOR SUPPORTING ME AND MY FAMILY- AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US TODAY. I'M HERE TODAY WITH MY HUSBAND ANTHONY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF OUR FAMILY TO OPPOSE THE APPOINTMENT OF DOCTORS MOVED IN ON A DEAD END TORQUE TO THE MEDICAL BOARD. WE ARE VICTIMS OF MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. MORE SPECIFICALLY OUR SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER JORDAN DIED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. AS A RESULT OF EGREGIOUS MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE. THE CURRENT MEDICAL INJURY COMPENSATION REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE HAS DEFINED OUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE AS NOT WORTHY. AND OF HAVING NO VALUE. THIS LAW DESPITE EFFORTS HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS WITH THE HELP OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WHICH THESE DOCTORS WERE MEMBERS- AND HAVE CONTINUED TO FIGHT. JORDAN MORE THAN JUST MISDIAGNOSED SHE SUFFERED AT THE HANDS OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WE TRUSTED TO HELP HER. THEY FAILED THEY FAILED US AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY FAIL JORDAN. AN ENTIRE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL AND THEIR PROVIDERS IGNORED HER SYMPTOMS. FOR TEST RESULTS AND LACKED ANY COORDINATED CARE BETWEEN SPECIALTIES WILL CONTINUE TO PASS THE BUCK AND PASS ALONG TO THE NEXT DOCTOR. MOST OF THE TIME WITHOUT DIRECTION DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. AND THE MEDICAL BOARD DID NOTHING ABOUT IT AFTER WE FILED COMPLAINTS. IN OUR OPINION THE APPOINTEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATION. NO THEY WERE NOT INVOLVED IN HER CARE DIRECTLY AS HE NEVER TREATED JORDAN BUT THEY HAVE AS LOBBYIST BOUGHT THE LAWS AND THEIR FOUNDATION TO ALLOW US THE ABILITY TO HOLD THOSE WERE NEGLIGENT ACCOUNTABLE. AND AS BOARD MEMBERS FAILED TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS. AS SUCH WE BELIEVE THE CMA THE MEDICAL BOARD AND THESE APPOINTEES CONTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PROFESSIONALS WHO COMMIT MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. ACTIVE OR GREGIS NEGLIGENCE AND WE AT THE PATIENTS OFFER. AFTER JORDAN DIED WE FILED FORMAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DATE NOT ONE INVESTIGATION HAS TAKEN PLACE NOT ONE INTERVIEW WITH US HAS TAKEN PLACE. ALL OF OUR INVESTIGATIONS BUT ONE WERE CLOSED WITHOUT ANY RESOLUTION WITHOUT ANY COMMENTS. WITHOUT ANY DISCUSSION. WE WERE ADVISED THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD LIKELY NOT INVESTIGATE IF WE WERE IN CIVIL LITIGATION WHICH WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUT OF OUR OWN POCKET DUE TO THESE APPOINTEES FIGHT AGAINST ANY ADJUSTMENTS MICRO. EVERY COMPLAINT. THAT WAS CLOSED WHAT WITH EXCEPTION TO ONE THAT ONE I INCLUDED A MEDICALLY CITED PAPER OUTLINING OUR COMPLAINTS. NOBODY SHOULD EVER HAVE TO DO THAT. WE DO EXPECT THAT THIS COMPLAINT WILL ALSO BE CLOSED. I WELCOME AND ENCOURAGE EACH ONE OF THESE APPOINTEES TO CONTACT ME VIA SENATOR WORKSHOP IS THAT THEY WISH TO DISCUSS. IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE. CBS NEWS REPORTED ON AN EXCLUSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO STATE MEDICAL BOARDS WHICH FOUND THAT STATE MEDICAL BOARDS RESPONSIBLE FOR DISCIPLINING DOCTORS. REPEATEDLY INJURED THEIR PATIENTS OFTEN FAIL TO DISCIPLINE THOSE SAME DOCTORS. FOUR YEARS THESE IMPORTED APPOINTEES FOUGHT TO ALLOW PATIENTS HARMED BY MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE TO OBTAIN JUSTICE IN THE GLOBAL ARENA PROTECTING PROVIDERS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. NOW THEY WILL SIT ON A MEDICAL BOARD THAT INVESTIGATES LESS THAN 2% OF COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED. POLITICAL APPOINTEES TO THE MEDICAL BOARD THE MEDICAL BOARD CHARTER TO ENSURE PATIENT SAFETY AND TO HOLD DOCTORS ACCOUNTABLE IT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. ACTUALLY WHEN THOSE APPOINTEES HAVE FOR THEIR YEARS WITH THE CMA FOUGHT ALL ATTEMPTS TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO HOLD THESE PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE. JORDAN'S IFE WAS VALUABLE SHE IS WORTHY OF JUSTICE. I NO LONGER TRUST THE PROFESSION THE MEDICAL BOARD NOR THESE APPOINTEES TO PROTECT PATIENTS. OR TO REPRESENT PATIENT SAFETY AS SUCH I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO OPPOSE THE APPOINTMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS SORT COULD NOT ADAPT AND MAHMOUD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM- MADAME MODERATOR NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MEDICAL FROM ONE OF THIRTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

I'M THINKING JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MY SON'S DEATH I TURNED TO THE COURT BUT WAS DENIED ACCESS BECAUSE OF AN OUTDATED LAW ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. SO I TURNED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TRUSTING THEY WOULD STOP THIS DANGEROUS DOCTOR FROM HARMING ANOTHER PATIENT. MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATORS AND ATTORNEYS ATTORNEY GENERAL PROSECUTORS RECOMMENDED REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF THE DOCTOR'S LICENSE. HOWEVER AFTER A FOUR YEAR COMPLAINT PROCESS A DEAL WAS MADE WITH THE BOARD AND THE DOCTOR WAS LET OFF WITH A PUBLIC REPRIMAND A SLAP ON THE WRIST. ONE VIOLATED MEDICAL BOARD GUIDELINES AND TOOK PLACE UNDER THE PRESIDENCY OF DR DALLAS THE MONITOR OF. EMILY LIKE MINE DESERVE A MEDICAL BOARD WE CONTRAST TO FULFILL THE BOARD'S MISSION OF PATIENTS PROTECTION WE DO NOT NEED A BOARD DRIVEN BY THE CMA WHO WOULD RATHER PROTECT DANGERS DOCTORS AND PROTECT PATIENTS.

DR CANNELLA JEFF HAS PERSONALLY FINANCED WITH THE EMMY AWARD THAT GIVES ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO A DOCTOR WHO BRINGS IN THE MOST NEW MEMBERS. BOTH DOCTORS GOING ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR MAINTAIN ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP IN THE FAMILY FILE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD WHICH IS A CHANGE CONFLICT OF INTEREST OUR DOCTOR CORP- EARLIER TODAY ALSO WAS NOT COMPLETELY HONEST.

THANK YOU MEDICAL FROM NINE THIRTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI MY NAME IS ERIC ANDERSON I'M A CONSTITUENT OF SENATOR HERTZBERG IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA I DIDN'T REALIZE WOULD BE LIMITED TIME MIGHT BUT I DID SEND A LETTER NEARLY A YEAR AGO SO PLEASE READ THAT. I WILL JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME NOTES I MADE DURING THE HEARING BEFORE I REACH MY PREPARED STATEMENT I NEED TO CORRECT SOME OF THE MISINFORMATION THESE DOCTORS AFFECT YOU. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN LATIN TRUTHFUL WITH YOU AND THAT ALONE IS ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM FROM SERVING ON THE BOARD. ONE THE MEDICAL BOARD FOLLOW THEIR OWN GUIDELINES PROBABLY LESS THAN 25% OF THE TIME WE HAVE THE EVIDENCE PROVING THAT THESE APPLICANTS WERE NOT TRUTHFUL WITH YOU ABOUT THAT. YOU IT IS NOT THE STANDARD OF PROCEDURE TO INTERVIEW COMPLAINT I FILED A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND OTHER VICTIMS AND KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY ALMOST NEVER INTERVIEW A COMPLAINANT. BEFORE THEY CLOSE THE COMPLAINT THEY ONLY INTERVIEW IT IF IT MOVES ON TO THE NEXT LEVEL I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT SENATOR BATES MADE UP OUR MIND OR HEARING THE PUBLIC SPEAK THAT IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. MY FAMILY HAS FALLEN VICTIM TO MEDICAL ERRORS THREE TIMES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND ALL OF MY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN CLOSED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION. AND I NOW VOLUNTEER FULL TIME AS A PATIENT SAFETY ADVOCATE IN HONOR OF MY SISTER'S DEATH. I CO RUN THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PATIENT BACK THE LEAGUE CARE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WE SPENT THE LEGISLATURE REPORT FOR THE SUNSET REVIEW IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CALLED THE MEDICAL FARCE THE CALIFORNIA WHICH WENT LARGELY IGNORED AND WE WILL BE PROVIDING YOU MORE INFORMATION FOR THE NEXT FUNDS THAT REVIEW. YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE SPECIFIC BUT LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF CALIFORNIA'S DOCTORS USED TO BE MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND OTHER THIRD OF OUR MEMBERS A PORTION OF THOSE ARE MANDATED TO BE MEMBERS BY THEIR LOCAL MEDICAL SOCIETY. THE CMA WE'LL A LOT OF MONEY AND POLITICAL POWER IN THE STATE EVEN THOUGH MOST DOCTORS DON'T EVEN BELONG. A FEW YEARS BACK WHEN SENATOR JERRY HILL WAS BRINGING FORTH IS OFF THE BILL THAT REQUIRES DOCTORS ON PROBATION TO INFORM THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT STATUS. THE CMA WAS VERY BOTH LOCAL A OPPOSITE. TO IT. AND LIKEWISE THE DEATH GONNA DE WHO WAS. AS THE PRESENT OF THE MEADOW BOARD TIME WHAT ALSO VOCAL NOT IN THE- OF THE LARGEST. THERE'S OF ONLINE OF HIM IN OPPOSITION. GONNA DEATH ALSO DONATES A LOT OF MONEY TO THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WHEN I TOLD THE MEDICAL BOARD ABOUT MY PERSONAL MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE VERY. DETAILED GONNA DEATH THAT TO ME ON AN ELEVATOR RIDE TOGETHER BUT I SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAN TO. GO TO AOUT DR. AFTER PICKING MY JAW UP OFF THE FLOOR I REALIZE THAT HE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT HOW REAL VICTIMS ARE SUFFERING. WITH THE SYSTEM AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE THEIR DOCTORS. ONE OF THE DOCTORS THAT WAS AFFILIATED WITH CONTAMINATING OR OF BEING KNOWN AS DR HARI REDDI WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. DEB'S FIRST BEAUTY ON THE MEDICAL BOARD WHAT THE FED ON A PANEL THAT RESTORED. THAT SEX OFFENDERS LICENSE. READY IF THE BROTHER IN LAW OF. READY OF PER HELPED WHO WENT ON TO DONATE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DEATH NEW MEDICAL SCHOOL. I AM IMPLORING. COULD NOT CONFIRM THE EMPLOYEE APPOINTEE. WE NEED A REAL PATIENT ADVOCATE SERVING ON THE MEDICAL BOARD NOT BY DOCTORS. A NUMBER OF OUR ADVOCATES HAVE PUT IN APPLICATIONS TO SERVE ON THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND THEY WON'T EVEN CONSIDER US. WE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD TO FIX ALL OF ITS PROBLEMS BUT WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT KEEPS STACKING THE BOARD WITH NOMINEES LIKE THIS. IT MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER ANDERSON AYE NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OUR LAST WITNESS WILL COME FROM ONE OF UP. FIFTY ONE. MADAM CHAIR THIS IS RANDALL HAGER I APOLOGIZE FOR APPEARING OUT OF ORDER I HAVE THE SUPPORT ON BEHALF OF THE PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS ALLIANCE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THREE POSITIONS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MINUTE BG. YOU AYE I ALLUDED IN MY OPENING AND- SENATOR. FROM SANTA CRUZ- ARTICULATED BETTER THAN I DID AT THE ISSUE OF TRUST. THE ISSUE BEING AN HONEST BROKER NOT CAPTURED BY THE INDUSTRIES WHAT HE SAID- MISTER LAYERED. AND WHAT WE HEARD I THINK- IN THE TONE WORDS AND TEMPERAMENT OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE OPPOSING- WAS THAT ISSUE KEEP COMING BACK WHATEVER THE REASON IS IT'S THE BALANCE THAT WE HAVE TO. ACHIEVE HERE AND SO AT EIGHT IN THE MOST- HUMAN WAYS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WHERE THERE WAS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LIKE LOOK IT'S HARD AYE AYE WE HAVE BEFORE HERE WOULD THAT THE PROFESSIONALS MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US. AND SOMETIMES YOU DON'T AGREE AND THAT'S OK THAT'S OUR JUDGMENT THAT'S OUR JOB BUT IN ORDER TO INSPIRE TRUST IN THE PROCESS WE HAVE TO DO EXTRAORDINARY DUE DILIGENCE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A RATIONAL BASIS FOR DISAGREEING WITH SOME OF THE PROFESSIONALS THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY MAKE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO TO HEAR JUST VERY BRIEFLY EACH OF YOU AS YOU. PROCESS THE UPON THE FOLKS THAT SPOKE HERE. AND THIS THEME OF TRUST.

SO ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION SURE THAT 95% OF ALL CASES ARE CLOSED WITHOUT ANY ACTION- IT IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE INFORMATION. OF ANY ANYONE YEAH. ALTHOUGH I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT IS AN ACCURATE STATEMENT THE NUMBERS ARE MORE- INDEED THE DISCIPLINE RATE IS MORE LIKE- 8% OF THE OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE BELIEVE RATHER IS NOT A BIG DIFFERENCE MINUTES TRUE THAT IN ITS 8% VERSUS 5% BUT THAT'S BECAUSE A MORE ACCURATE PERCENTAGE GOOD I KNOW BUT I'M NOT SURE OF THAT APPROACH AND WIND- THESE NOMINATIONS ARE COMING TO THE FLOOR BUT I'M I LIKE TO MAYBE SEE THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS- SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW MATRIX OF- I CASES AND THEN- BUT SOMETHING ELSE. A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BROUGHT UP I ACTUALLY ASKED A QUESTION I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHICH DOCTOR ANSWERED IT. BUT NUMBER PEOPLE BROUGHT UP THAT THESE CASES ARE CLOSE WITHOUT EVER HER INTERVIEWING THE CLAIM IT SO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT AGAIN IS THAT IS THAT STANDARD- PROCEDURES AND SO IF IT IS AN OBVIOUSLY WAS VIOLATED IN THE CASES THAT WE HEARD TODAY. WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO THE TO THE TO THE DIRT ON THE BOARD THE LONGEST WAIT I WOULD APPRECIATE. FROM CARRILLO SAID THAT'S NOT THE STANDARD PROCEDURE ACTUALLY THE INVESTIGATOR IS SUPPOSED TO TALK TO THE- NUMBER OF THE PATIENTS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE SO THANKS. THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY DID NOT- I THINK THAT'S A VIOLATION. OKAY THANK YOU. THIRTY THORPE. YOU KNOW HONESTLY- I DON'T KNOW AND- I SEE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON THE BOARD FOR EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT I AM WE'LL GET THOSE AT THE LEVEL THAT I GET INFORMATION I EIGHT I HONESTLY JUST DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU- I- THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION THAT WE CAN MAKE THE REQUEST OF. OF STAFF RULES COMMITTEE STAFF TO FOLLOW UP- I WOULD ASK IS ARE ALL OF THESE NUMBERS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF CASES. INVESTIGATED BUT BEEN GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL THE NEXT LEVEL THE PERCENTAGES IT IS ALL OF THIS PUBLIC INFORMATION ARE. CAN CAN ANY OF YOU DOCTOR COULD NOT A DEV IT IS THIS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC READILY- YES HURRICANE SIX. IT'S PRESENTED TO THE BOARD MEETING AND EXHIBIT A BIRD DOG. K. THANK YOU. TOM I DO THINK I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD STAFF RELATED TO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR- WHEN THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THE COMPLAINT AND IS. ARE ABLE TO BE CONSULTED OR HAVE AN INTERVIEW AND SO- TO MY STAFF WHO I KNOW WE'RE LISTENING BETWEEN NOW AND SHOULD THESE APPOINTMENTS COME TO THE FLOOR DEPENDING UPON THE OUTCOME TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE RESPONSE TO THAT SO IF WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US CLEARLY. THESE APPOINTMENTS ARE ARE VERY CRITICAL APPOINTMENTS OUTSIDE TO CONSUMERS AND TO THE PUBLIC. AND CLEARLY- YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM SOME PEOPLE TODAY AND- IT'S HARD FOR US IN THE POSITION THAT WE'RE IN AND WE DON'T DEAL WITH THESE CASES ON A WEEKLY BASIS YOU'RE PART OF PANELS YOU HEAR. YOU GIVE OF YOUR TIME AND- CLEARLY WE'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE IN SUPPORT AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE NOT HAD THE BEST RESULT. FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT'S ALWAYS VERY DIFFICULT AND HARD TO HEAR- ON MY DAD- SO IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US- WILL BE HERE PROBABLY THOSE WHO ARE MOST ARE AGGRIEVED BUT- I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME. REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE HERE ABOUT THE PUBLIC'S TRUST TO THE TO THE POINT OF THE TRUST THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO PLACE AND CLEARLY YOUR VOLUNTEERS YOU ON'T YOU DON'T NEED TO SERVE YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE BUSY LIVES SO I APPRECIATE THAT IT IS A VERY SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE YOU DO. BUT IT IS AN EXPECTATION AND SO IT IS HARD FOR US TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THE SYSTEM HAS NOT- SERVE THEM WELL ALL OUR OUR ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT IN THE POSITION TO JUDGE THAT'S WHY. THERE IS A LEGAL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THAT THAT'S WHY THERE ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IN PLACE LIKE THIS AND SO. THAT OUR PUBLIC TRUST PEACE IS VERY IMPORTANT I THINK YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE- THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE MORE- IN DEPTH. RULES COMMITTEE HEARINGS IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATION- CLEARLY WE'VE HAD SOME DIFFICULT WHAT'S IN THE PAST BUT THIS ONE HAS BEEN. MORE SO I ACTUALLY. WOULD LIKE EACH OF YOU TO CLOSE TO GIVE ME SOME CLOSING COMMENTS ON YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC AND YOUR ABILITY TO BALANCE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE. IT WOULD- AND THEN WILL YOU I WILL MOVE FOR A MOTION AND I WILL TAKE SEPARATE MOTIONS ON ALL THREE JUST BECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO. MADE COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF SOME NOT ALL AS A GROUP SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO JUST TAKE EACH MOTION SEPARATELY WHEN WE GET THERE BUT- DOCTOR GONNA DEVIL OF ME START WITH YOU TO MAKE CONCLUDING COMMENTS THAT I'LL GO TO DR THORPE AND THEN TO DR. MAHMOUD AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND TOM BUT I DO THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT- TO MURDER CHAIR ARE OUR YEARLY.

AND I THINK I AM I'M NOT I'M I'M I THINK I'M SURE THAT I WOULD BE READY TO MAKE ANY ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS ANY BREACH IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AT ANY LEVEL. AND AS I SAID BEFORE AND I E. ECKEL- SEVERAL OTHER SENATORS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE- AT THINGS ARE NOT HAPPENING IN TIMELY FASHION AND THAT DOCTOR FRUSTRATE ME EQUALLY AS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED AND- WE NEED TO MAKE SOME MOVES OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE A- CHALLENGES AND THERE ARE.

CONTINUE TO LEAD THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IN. CALIFORNIA AS OF OUR STANDARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOT. MENTOR THANK AT ONE YES. YOU KNOW HOW ARMED I JUST I KNOW IF IT'S A HE IN THE SKY BUT I THINK IN THE LARGER RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE. IS THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A BOARD OF PHARMACY BOARD OF ACCOUNTANCY THE NURSES AND NURSE PRACTITIONER J. AND EVERYONE OF THESE BOARDS ARE REGULATED I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF IT'S POSSIBLE HOW MANY CASES AND IF THERE'S AN ABERRATION MAY BECAUSE THE MICRO ISSUE MAY BECAUSE THERE'S SOME OTHER ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THIS BOARD. BUT IS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF ALL GETS HER FORTY ARMY BOARD THIS FORTY ONE OR SOMETHING BOARDS ON THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. A SENATOR OF COVERAGE TO THE HEAD OF THAT RIGHT YEAH AND SO TO GET SOME SENSE IS TO SEE IF THERE'S AN ABERRATION BECAUSE OF MICRO BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES N. N. AND- THEY GET TO IN A LARGER SENSE WHICH WOULD HELP US TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS AND HOW THE BOARD IS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL THE OTHER. CONSUMER BOARDS TO HAVE SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES JUST DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE LAW. AND PUBLIC POLICY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NUMBER TOWN A YES- YOU PROBABLY HAVE YOUR HAND UP.

WE CAN SIR BRING UP THIS IN. THAT YOU PROVIDE US TODAY I KNOW A VERY KEEN FOR YOU TO DO THE- TO COME. AND LOOK FOR SOME. IN TERMS OF RESEARCH. THAT THE BOARD PERHAPS. FOR MORE TIME JUST. OF WHETHER THAT. WE ARE READING THAT WILL SIGN ON THE BURDEN CROSS. TRAFFIC OR- ENFORCED INVEST. THAT USED TO BE PRESS STATUS NO LONGER THE- WHAT'S THAT HOW. ISSUE AND THE ON THE- THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE. ABSENT WHAT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DIVE TO TAKE LOOK AT THE BECAUSE ONE AS MANY ONE IS TOO MANY ARE WILLING YOU LOSE A ONE AND YOU NOT GET ANY REST. SO I WILL. MY SUPPORT AS I SAID IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SERVER THAT WE'VE ASKED THE GENTLEMAN- WHO HAVE INCREDIBLE- BACKGROUNDS IN EDUCATION AND DEVOTION FOR MANY YEARS TO THEIR PATIENTS. ARE FOR THEM TO BEAR- ALL OF THE- MISTAKES GOING ON BEFORE THEM AND PRESENT. ALL WE NEED TO FIND A PATH- SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO. YOU KNOW EXERCISE THEIR EXPERTISE BUT DO THAT WITH SOME NOTING THE PARAMETERS THAT THEY NEED TO SERVE WITH THEM SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I ALWAYS LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS AND JOAN MY HEART REACHES OUT TO YOU. THOSE WHO OPPOSE AND PLEASE KNOW THAT I AM COMMITTED TO SEEK SOME SOLUTIONS THAT THIS CAN'T HAPPEN ALSO EASILY TO ANY OTHERS THAT COME FORWARD WITH COMPLAINTS. ON THE MALPRACTICE ISSUES SO WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL- PHYSICIANS OR HEALTH PROVIDERS ACROSS THE BOARD. THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY HARPER MY REMARKS. SENATOR THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN. BREAKING DOWN PROTEIN REALLY QUICK- FIRST OF ALL I THINK. BEING A MEMBER OF THE CMA THAT THAT THAT'S A STRAW MAN ARGUMENT THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T CARRY ANY WEIGHT FOR ME TO ME THAT TELLS ME THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEDICATED. TO THEIR PROFESSION AND WANT TO BE INVOLVED HAVING SAID THAT WE CAN'T HAVE THE SUNSET REVIEW- IS SOON ENOUGH AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED ON THIS BOARD. SO IT IS. OUR I'M- PEREKOP THAT IS NOW. WITH THESE INTO. BUT MAY AS CENTER HER. YOU'LL OUT A JUST. AND WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE- BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. HAPPEN BUT PEOPLE DO TO JOHN. AND YOU KNOW BASIC- AND I WANT TO SEE MORE DATA SO I APPRECIATE APPROACH HIM ASKING FOR THAT BECAUSE THE AND THAT'LL BE REALLY HELPFUL AND- I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S OUT PARTICIPATING TODAY. AND WAS VERY ENLIGHTENING HEARING THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN- I WILL BEFORE I ASK FOR MOTIONS A COUPLE THINGS. I DO FULLY INTEND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE TERROR OF BEING P. RELATED TO THE SUNSET REVIEW AND THESE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS THAT HAVE COME UP. THAT WE WILL MAKE SURE AND GET- CORRESPONDENCE TO BOTH THE MEDICAL BOARD. DIRECTOR AS WELL AS COPYING THE CHAIR OF BMP REGARDLESS OF HOW A RECOMMENDATION COMES OUT OF THIS BODY TODAY FOR. APPOINTEES GOING TO THE FULL SENATE FOR CONFIRMATION THAT IS WHERE THE CONFIRMATION HAPPENS. SO I WILL DO THAT- I DO. I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE FOR MORE MEMBERS HEADING OUR WAY FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD TO BE CONFIRMED WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO AND I SAY THAT TO THE GOOD DOCTORS THAT ARE. HERE WITH US TODAY BECAUSE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THERE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE FOCUS ON THE MEDICAL BOARD RIGHT NOW. AND SO IT ISN'T IT ISN'T JUST R. THREE APPOINTEES TODAY. IT IS ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT AND AS I SAW I THINK YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR MADE. A PUBLIC APPOINTMENT- SO I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN. APPROACHED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC A SMALL NUMBER OF FOLKS TODAY BUT- WE HAVE QUESTIONS WE NEED ANSWERED- I DO BELIEVE. WE SHOULD MOVE THIS FORWARD TODAY- I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW SOON THESE WILL BE ON THE FLOOR FOR CONFIRMATION. BUT I WANT TO GIVE NOTICE THAT THE CONVERSATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE AND I AGREE WITH YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN- PEOPLE'S INVOLVEMENT IN AN ASSOCIATION IS ONE FACTOR. BUT PEOPLE GET INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED AND IT'S IN AND SO- I DO. AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT FOR CERTAIN ARM. WHO CAN APPLY TO BE ON BOARDS THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THE SENATE HAS AN APPOINTMENT THE ASSEMBLY HAS AN APPOINTMENT ON THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE HAVE PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS. I'M I WOULD SAY THAT THERE IS A CONVERSATION THERE ARE FIFTEEN MEMBERS OF THIS BOARD. EIGHT WHICH ARE DESIGNATED BY- BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOARD EIGHT THAT ARE UP FROM THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND SEVEN THAT OUR PUBLIC. MEMBERS MAYBE THERE IS A CONVERSATION WE AN HAVE ABOUT INCREASING THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC MEMBERS. SO THAT THEIR AT LEAST EQUAL. OR MORE THAN GIVEN IT IT IS A PUBLIC PROTECTION BOARD. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD- SUPPORT THAT AS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD BECAUSE IT REALLY IS ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC YOU REPRESENT- CERTAINLY THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT IN YOUR ROLES AND YOU BRING THAT EXPERTISE AS I SAID BEFORE. BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE TO FEEL THAT THERE'S BALLOTS ARE AND THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DECIDE IF WE ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OR NOT. I OFTEN SAY WHEN'S WHEN SOMEONE WANTS TO POINT OUT YOUR LEADER I'M LIKE I'M A LEADER. IF PEOPLE AGREE THAT I AM A LEADER OTHERWISE I AM NOT A LEADER AND SO. I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT IT'S NOT MY DETERMINATION IT'S YOURS. SO OUT WITH THAT. I'M GONNA SEPARATE EACH ONE BUT I HOPE. I APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE- GENTLEMAN TODAY I HOPE YOU TAKE TO HEART SOME OF WHAT WE SAID- WE TAKE OUR JOB AS SERIOUSLY AS YOU TAKE YOURS AND SO. ARE CERTAINLY MORE TO COME LET ME. ASK IF THERE IS A MOTION ON ITEM NUMBER TWO GOVERNOR'S APPOINTEES REQUIRED TO APPEAR NUMBER B. I'LL START WITH DOCTOR DEATH GET ON A DAY OF- FOR A MOTION.
