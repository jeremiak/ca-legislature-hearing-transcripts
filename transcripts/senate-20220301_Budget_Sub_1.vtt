00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:42.272
IMPLEMENTS- THESE PROGRAMS THAT

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:44.908
. EXTENSION OF UNIVERSAL I'M

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.543
PROVISIONAL CAN ARE NAY WOOD IT

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:48.412
IS FIVE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.813
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.115
THAT ARE BEING STARTED SO I'M

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:55.986
RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE WOULD BE

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:57.154
SOME- NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:45:57.221 --> 00:45:58.622
. BUT OR SUPPORTED WAYS HELP

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:01.425
ADDRESS ISSUES. I THINK WHAT

00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:04.161
WHEN IT COMES TO- IT ALL WATER

00:46:04.228 --> 00:46:05.963
RECORD THINK OBVIOUSLY THE LEAD

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:07.731
AWAY MONITOR AND SEE WHAT WHAT

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:12.503
ISSUE. ARISE. IT IS ALSO A THE

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:13.704
WAY THEY WE APPROACH THIS BUDGET

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.938
I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE YOU KNOW

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.540
THERE ARE SO- SIGNIFICANT-

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:17.441
THINGS THAT WERE A AGREED UPON

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.243
LAST YEAR BUT IN THE BUDGET.

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:20.444
UNIVERSAL TRADITION KINDERGARTEN

00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:22.713
BEING ONE OF THEM- IN ADDITION

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:24.748
EXAMPLE UNIVERSAL MEALS ON THE

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.717
TELEVISION SIDE I THINK WE TAKE

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.252
THAT THE PERSON WE'VE TAKEN TO

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.353
REVIEWING THE PROPOSALS THIS

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:30.454
YEAR IS THAT THOSE ARE THE

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.688
PRIORITY BECAUSE THOSE HAVE BEEN

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:33.457
AGREED UPON AND IF THE- IF THERE

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:34.791
ARE CAPACITY ISSUES WOULD BE

00:46:34.858 --> 00:46:37.094
AVAILABLE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:38.028
SAY DO FEWER THINGS IN THIS

00:46:38.095 --> 00:46:39.796
BUDGET. YOUR NEW DIGS SO FOR

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:41.365
EXAMPLE ON THE GLOVES THAT YOU

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.534
CAN DO IS SAY NOT ADOPT AS MANY

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.335
NEW COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:46.937
OR IMPLEMENT NEW INITIATIVES AND

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:48.205
FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:51.141
THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE- PART OF

00:46:51.208 --> 00:46:52.609
WHAT LAST YEAR. I THINK THERE

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:53.677
ARE A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.012
THAT CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED AS

00:46:55.078 --> 00:46:56.613
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:57.814
THAT CAN BE A CHALLENGE THE

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:58.916
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WAS

00:46:58.982 --> 00:47:00.350
FEES BEEN IN PART TO TRY TO

00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:01.752
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT- WE

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.387
KNOW THAT THE STAFFING- ISSUES

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.522
HAVE BEEN PROPERLY SUBSTANTIAL.

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:07.558
ONE THING I WOULD NOTE- JUST A

00:47:07.624 --> 00:47:09.293
SMALL PIECE BUT IN TERMS OF THE

00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:10.961
TWENTY FOUR UNITS ARE OF YOU SEE

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.696
THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THIS

00:47:12.763 --> 00:47:14.798
WAS A REQUIREMENT- WAS SUPPOSED

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:17.201
TO TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.602
ONE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.137
ONE FOUR- TRADITIONAL GUITAR

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:21.371
TEACHERS TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:23.974
UNITS EVERY CD. THAT IN THE LAST

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.843
BUDGET WAS DELAYED TO AUGUST OF

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:27.744
TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THERE IS

00:47:27.811 --> 00:47:29.346
A LITTLE BIT OF BUFFER BUT ONE

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.581
UNDER CURRENT LAW ONCE YOU GET

00:47:30.647 --> 00:47:32.316
THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:34.017
EXPECTATION OF THAT- TAKING

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:34.851
PICTURES HAVE THOSE UNITS AND

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:36.620
SO. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S PART

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:38.455
OF THE CONCERN THAT THAT READING

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.424
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW WITH

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:41.258
GETTING TEACHERS IN THE

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.593
CLASSROOM NOW BUT IT WILL BE.

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:51.301
AND IN. THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:52.536
FOUR FISCAL YEAR. I THANK YOU

00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:53.937
ARE ARMED OF. UP WITH QUESTION

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:55.572
FISH. TO THOSE THREE PER. BUT

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:57.074
BEFORE I THAT. LET ME. BUT OFF

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.675
OF A CALM. THAT MR COOPER MADE.

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.877
IN RISK. TO OR RELY. TO A

00:48:00.944 --> 00:48:03.847
COMMENT MADE BY TEN DETAILER. OF

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:04.715
THE CYBER SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:07.050
BECAUSE- SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.518
THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:12.055
MOVE TO ANOTHER. MOMENT SYSTEMS.

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:13.056
UP FROM THE AVERAGE DAILY

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.658
ATTENDANCE. AND WHILE MANY OF

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:17.594
THE SUPPORT THAT. WE HAVE SCHOOL

00:48:17.661 --> 00:48:20.697
DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT

00:48:20.764 --> 00:48:22.666
WOULD WIN AND WAS UNDER THAT.

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.668
DRAMATICALLY IN MANY CASES THE

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.903
LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.740
WOULD GAIN OF BILLION DOLLARS

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.475
UNDER UNDER ENVIRONMENT SYSTEM

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:34.845
BUT IF IT REMAINS IN PROP NINETY

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.580
EIGHT AND IT'S A FIX HI. OTHER

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:38.515
SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO LOSE A

00:48:38.582 --> 00:48:40.517
BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO

00:48:40.584 --> 00:48:42.686
FUND THE MOMENT SYSTEM SO THE

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:45.222
WAY THAT IT WILL WORK IS IF WE

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:46.890
MADE AN ALLOCATION OF THREE

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:49.393
BILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT THE

00:48:49.459 --> 00:48:50.994
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT LOSE ARE

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.663
HELD HARMLESS BY THOSE THAT

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:54.998
GAINED GAINED AND THE AGGREGATE

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.700
OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHAT

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.902
THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:01.271
WALKED AT TO WHAT MR CABRAL JUST

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:04.241
REFERRED TO. AS TRYING TO NARROW

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:07.210
NEW THINGS IN THE ON GOING

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:10.347
FUNDING THAT THREE BILLION THEN

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:12.416
COMPETES AGAINST MANY OF THE

00:49:12.482 --> 00:49:13.884
THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.452
OR THE THREE BILLION FOR HOME TO

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:19.222
SCHOOL FOUND- TRANSPORTATION OR

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:20.057
THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION THAT

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:22.392
WERE SHORT. IN THE INCREASE IN

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.328
PERSON STORES TO THE DISTRICTS

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:25.729
WE COULD BUY THAT DOWN WITH ONE

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.097
TIME MONEY BUT THEN THAT'S AN

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.165
ONGOING THING FOR THE NEXT

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:30.300
YEAR'S BUDGET IN TWO POINT THREE

00:49:30.367 --> 00:49:32.169
BILLION DOLLARS THAT UNLESS WE-

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:35.439
AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM EVERYONE.

00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.274
IN OUR HEARING ON PROP NINETY

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:38.442
EIGHT IS THAT THE COST OF LIVING

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.344
INCREASE IN PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.546
DOES NOT COVER EXPENSES THAT

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:43.880
THAT WE REALLY NEW TO NEED A

00:49:43.947 --> 00:49:45.916
BIGGER BASE TO K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:49:45.982 --> 00:49:49.319
DISTRICTS. WITH THE ONGOING PROP

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:51.521
NINETY EIGHT MONEY SO AS I MOVED

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:53.357
TO THE FACILITIES QUESTION YOU

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:56.660
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;AN SEE THAT FOR US DECIDING&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:59.396
WHAT TO PRIORITIZE ALL THOSE

00:49:59.463 --> 00:50:00.731
THINGS COMPETE AGAINST EACH

00:50:00.797 --> 00:50:03.333
OTHER. AND WE ARE TRYING TO MEET

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.236
THE NEEDS BUT- IT JUST-

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:07.671
ADVOCATING FOR MOVE TO THE

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.506
ENROLLMENT SYSTEM ABSENT

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:10.774
DESCRIBING HOW MUCH MONEY IT

00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:12.242
WOULD COST TO COMPETE AGAINST

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:13.744
EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.579
SOMETHING I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT.

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.381
NOT TO DRILL DOWN ON LITTLE

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:24.254
WITH. FINANCE CHAU AND- THE

00:50:24.321 --> 00:50:25.722
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THE

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:27.090
CELL WHAT HE'S- THE THING I WANT

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:28.892
TO DROP IS THE TIME FOR. BECAUSE

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:30.394
WE REALLY ASKING TO EXPAND

STARTING IN THE NEXT YEAR THE

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:34.998
BUDGET YEAR. AND THEY WILL NEED

00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:36.733
THE FACILITIES THAT AND

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.201

PANELISTS SAID FACILITIES WERE

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.972
AN ISSUE AND WE NEED TO DO IT.

00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:43.540
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NEED FOR

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:45.475
FACILITIES WHICH WILL START IN

00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.844
THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR HOW DO WE

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.679
MAKE SURE THAT AS PART OF THIS

00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:52.215
EXPANSION WE HAVE ACTUALLY

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:54.651
ADDRESS THAT. TO SYNCHRONIZE

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:57.087
WITH EVERYBODY EXPANDING AT IT

00:50:57.154 --> 00:50:57.888
DURING THE TIME OF THE

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:43.627
FACILITIES- ARE WORKING TO BLEND

00:52:43.693 --> 00:52:44.661
IN PRETTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:46.229
TOGETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:47.664
BEFORE I MOVED TO THE ONLY- LET

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.332
ME. DO A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS

00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:51.668
FIRST. YOU MENTIONED FACILITIES

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:53.603
MONEY BUT IS THERE IS THAT

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:55.539
UNIQUELY FOR THIS PROGRAM OR IS

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:57.073
THAT WITHIN THE FACILITIES MONEY

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.342
THAT IS. SORT OF BRIDGING US THE

00:52:59.409 --> 00:53:05.382
NEXT YEAR TO FOR ALL. K. THROUGH

00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:06.983
TWELVE FACILITIES. THAT WOULD BE

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.185
BRIDGE OUT FOR TAKE FACILITIES

00:53:09.252 --> 00:53:11.922
SO LOOKING RAIN THAT INCLUDE BY

00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:13.256
PRE K. WITH THEN COME. FOR

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:14.224
DISTRICT THAT DON'T HAVE

00:53:14.291 --> 00:53:16.493
CAPACITY OR HAVE OUTDATED

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.028
FACILITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:20.030
APPLY FOR MONEY AND THAT THIS

00:53:20.096 --> 00:53:21.932
WOULD THEN COMPETE WITH THAT IS

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:25.602
THAT. OF THE CASE. YES CERTAINLY

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:27.070
THAT WOULD BE THE CASE OKAY AND

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:28.638
THEN AND THEN ONE COMMENT BEFORE

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:32.108
WE MOVE ON- WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:34.578
LOCAL BONDING CAPACITY. IN MY

00:53:34.644 --> 00:53:36.546
VIEW THAT THEN BECOMES AN EQUITY

00:53:36.613 --> 00:53:38.548
ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.083
LOWER INCOME OR DISADVANTAGED

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:41.685
DISTRICTS HAVE LESS OF A

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:43.920
CAPACITY TO PASS BONDS. AND SO

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.656
THEN IF WERE LONG ON BONDS TO DO

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:51.261
THIS. IT IT REALLY FAVORS

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:53.096
DISTRICTS THAT ARE. OUR

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:54.698
ADVANTAGE TO THOSE THAT ARE

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.399
DISADVANTAGED JUST FOR THE

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:58.368
RECORD OF WHAT'S MOVED TO THE

00:53:58.435 --> 00:54:00.570
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON DRILLING

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:02.939
DOWN ON FACILITIES ANY COMMENTS

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:05.308
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. YEAH I

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:07.010
THINK WE FOR THE NUMBER OF

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.478
CONCERNS AS WELL ON THIS ISSUE

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:11.681
AND I THINK WE DO RECOGNIZE

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:13.249
THAT. WITH OF THESE ISSUES THEY

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:14.985
DO TAKE TIME- WE HAVE HEARD.

00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:16.786
ABOUT THE SEARCH OF THE PROCESS

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.888
IT TAKES TO GET A BIG. THROUGH

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:20.857
THE STATE THROUGH THE- YOU KNOW

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:22.092
THE STATE BECAUSE SCHOOL

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.893
DISTRICTS FOR THE BILL BACK IT'S

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.930
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A OF A- I'M

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.732
INTENSIVELY THE PROCESS. I'M I

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.667
WOULD NOT THAT THE STATE DID IN

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:31.601
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THERE WAS FOR

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.136
AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:54:33.203 --> 00:54:34.904
WAS PROVIDED. I WAS INTENDED TO

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:36.373
BE FOR FACILITIES RELATED EARLY

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:38.141
EDUCATION I THOUGHT THIS WAS

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.109
FUNDING A COULD BE USED FOR. A

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:40.176
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR

00:54:40.243 --> 00:54:41.978
STATE PRESCHOOL OFFER FULL DAY

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:43.513
KINDERGARTEN SO THE STATE HAS

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:45.749
PROVIDED SOME FUNDING- A

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:46.816
QUESTION WOULD BE WHETHER THERE

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:48.685
NEEDS TO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:54:48.752 --> 00:54:50.186
PROVIDED TO MEET THE DEMAND I

00:54:50.253 --> 00:54:50.954
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:54:51.021 --> 00:54:52.756
WORKED OUT. THAT WE ARE

00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:53.857
MONITORING I THINK THAT THE OPC

00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:56.059
OF THE WOMEN'S- MONITORING THAT

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:58.061
PROGRAM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION.

00:54:58.128 --> 00:54:59.162
IT DEFINITELY COULD BE A BETTER

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.296
THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:01.631
FUNDING NEEDED I WOULD NOTE

00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:05.168
THAT- THAT FUNDING IS NON PROFIT

00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:05.802
NINETY EIGHT WITH A FUNDING IN

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:08.805
GENERAL FUND- SO IT'S- JUST LIKE

00:55:08.872 --> 00:55:10.140
THE SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.841
PROGRAM- IS NOT NINETY EIGHT SO

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:13.076
IT. DOESN'T COMPETE WITH OTHER

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:15.745
EDUCATION. PROGRAMS BUT IT DOES-

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:16.813
IT DOES MEAN THAT IT'S COMING

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.748
OUT OF OTHER THAN THE NOMINEE

00:55:18.815 --> 00:55:21.251
GENERAL FUND. FIVE IT CAN BE

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:22.318
BECAUSE OF FACILITIES AND THEN

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.520
THAT WOULD BE FOR EXCLUDED FROM

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.788
THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:25.622
IF YOU WERE TO PURSUE THAT

00:55:25.689 --> 00:55:28.324
OPTION BUT- ARMY IT IS ANOTHER-

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.026
IT'S ONE WAY TO TRY TO PROVIDED

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.294
SUPPORT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:37.867
STATE HAS ALREADY. STARTED DO.

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:40.570

MIKE. TO THE SECOND. BUT I HAVE

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:07.590
SORT OF A- THIS. QUESTION OF

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.058
THE- OF FINE. THE THAT ACTUALLY

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.261
DOES HAS FOR HIM FOR. ACROSS THE

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:14.597
STATE AND THAT IS ABOUT. THE

00:57:14.664 --> 00:57:16.566
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BASIC K.

00:57:16.633 --> 00:57:19.202
EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. THIS

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:22.172
PROGRAM AND- BECAUSE THE FUNDING

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:23.573
FOR THIS PROGRAM COMES THROUGH

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.075
THE FORMULA OR THE ALLOCATIONS

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:27.577
THAT BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:57:27.644 --> 00:57:31.815
DON'T GET. IT APPEARS THAT THE

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:34.584
EXPECTATION IS. THAT IF YOUR

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:36.419
BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:37.253

OF YOUR OWN RESOURCES WHERE

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:39.722
EVERYBODY ELSE IS GETTING

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:42.158
SOMETHING IN THE FORMULA. TO DO

00:57:42.225 --> 00:57:44.527
IT AND THE SAN LUIS COASTAL

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.529

SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY'RE

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.407
GOING TO HAVE A PLUNGE IN

COMMISSION'S MAYBE IN THREE OR

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.649
THREE AND A HALF YEARS. AND SO

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.751
ASKING THEM TO TAKE ON WHAT IS

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:10.386
THE EQUIVALENT OF 3% OF THEIR

BETWEEN BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS IN

WARDEN IS THAT CORRECT. FOR THIS

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:50.913
IS THAT CHRIS FERGUSON SO

TRANSLATE THAT IT BASICALLY

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:10.533
MEANS THEY ABSORB THE COST OF

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.735
THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IN PRE

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:15.705
K. THAT IS NOT ABSORBED THE SAME

WIFE YOUR NON BASIC A DISTRICT

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.542
AND IF IT IS ROUGHLY 3% OF THEIR

FOR THAT THEY HAVE TAX REVENUES-

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.189
BOTTOM THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:34.624
HAVING SAID THAT WE'RE STILL

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.192
PUTTING SOMETHING ON THEM

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.927
WITHOUT GIVING THE MONEY TO DO.

01:01:37.994 --> 01:01:40.830
AND IN THAT ONE PARTICULAR

01:01:40.897 --> 01:01:42.698
DISTRICT ARE GONNA DROP OUT A

01:01:42.765 --> 01:01:43.699

APPOINT CLOSES IT THERE IN A

01:01:55.711 --> 01:01:57.947
WORLD OF HURT OTHERWISE SO. THE

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:00.716
AGENCY TO ME THAT OF THE

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:02.919
EXPECTATION IS THE RITUAL AND

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.854
TAKE CARE OF IT BUT BUT- I THINK

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:07.223
LOADING A NEW PROGRAM ON TO THEM

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.424
AND NOT PAYING FOR SOMETHING

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:10.660
THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IN SOME

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:14.630
FORM. R. AND I'M JUST SPEAKING

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:19.068
TO ONE THEY'RE ONE AND. THE

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:19.769
INTERESTING THING IS THAT. IF

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.206
THE- ON SCHOOL ON BASE AID IT IS

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:24.740

- V. OUR ALLOCATION TO A MOMENT.

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:34.750
AND THEIR DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:36.219
BASIC GRADE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:39.122

01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:41.624
DISTRICT. THAT IS A FARMWORKER

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:44.827
COMMUNITY IT IS A DISADVANTAGED

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.629
COMMUNITY IT IS A VERY SMALL

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:49.365
OVERWHELMING. NUMBER OF FREE AND

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.400
REDUCED MEALS IN THAT SCHOOL

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.136
DISTRICT BUT THERE'S A LOCKET

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:54.303
INSTALLATION INSIDE THE

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:55.738
BOUNDARIES OF THE DISTRICT THAT

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:58.908
WAS A HUGE PROPERTY TAX PAYER.

01:02:58.975 --> 01:03:01.010
AND AS A RESULT. WITH THIS

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:03.079
DISTRICT THAT WAS- MAJORITY OF

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:04.380
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS WAS

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.182
CONSIDERED A BASIC A DISTRICT

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.317
EVERYBODY NORMALLY WOULD LOOK AT

PERCENT. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IS

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:20.763
NOT A FAIR EXPECTATION AND SO. I

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.732
WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.567
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE OUR

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.302

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.258
YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:03.626
HAS A SON IN KINDERGARTEN I KNOW

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.394
HOW VALUABLE THAT IS AND- HAVING

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.830
HAD THAT T. K. EXPERIENCE. WAS

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:08.731
VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIS

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.499
DEVELOPMENT. BUT IS THIS

01:06:10.566 --> 01:06:11.600
SOMETHING WHERE THERE ARE

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:14.303
CONCERNS THAT IF THE BUDGET IF I

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.905

OURSELVES. THE SEARCH. AT THIS

01:06:24.046 --> 01:06:24.914
TIME OF OUR MULTI YOUR

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:27.049
PROJECTION WE DON'T SEE THAT

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:29.185
OCCURRING OKAY- BUT- YOU KNOW

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.586
THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY A

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:31.787
POSSIBILITY THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:33.055
TO DEAL WITH IF AND WHEN THAT

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.690
SITUATION WERE TO OCCUR. AND

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.492

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:52.675
FAMILIES WHO OFTEN JUST NEED

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.677
THE- THE COVERAGE OF THEIR

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:55.411
CHILDREN THAT THEY NEED THE

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.681
CHILD CARE- AND SO TO THE EXTENT

01:06:58.748 --> 01:06:59.582
THAT. YOU KNOW. LET'S JUST

01:06:59.648 --> 01:07:00.549
ASSUME A UNIVERSE IN WHICH WE

01:07:00.616 --> 01:07:02.551
DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH FUNDS TO

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:04.320
COVER BOTH. A UNIVERSAL PRE K.

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:07.223
R. KI K. I. AND WE AND ALSO

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:08.357
SOMETHING LIKE UNIVERSAL

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:11.093
EXPANSION PRESCHOOL ACCESS. I IS

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.294
THERE A SENSE THAT ONE OF THESE

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.462
IS GOING TO BE PRIORITIZED OVER

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:14.530
THE OTHER- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.966
PRIORITIZING KEY K. BUT WHAT. IS

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.734
THAT. IS THAT CHOICE SOMETHING

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:20.202
THAT WAS INTENTIONAL AND I

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:22.505
GUESS. THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS

01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:23.873
THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU

01:07:23.939 --> 01:07:25.941

01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:29.178
Y. PREFERENCE TKO OVER PRESCHOOL

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:31.580
OR VICE VERSA. YOU KNOW I WOULD

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:32.715
SAY THAT- FROM THE

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:33.849
ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:34.984

AHEAD AND BREAK THOSE PROGRAMS

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.935
TOGETHER- IN A WAY THAT THAT

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.970
PROVIDES PARENTS- WITH THE

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.906
CHOICE. OF FOR THEIR CHILDREN SO

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:58.307
THAT THEY THEY CAN BEST CHOOSE

01:07:58.374 --> 01:07:59.875
THE PROGRAM THAT THEY THINK WILL

01:07:59.942 --> 01:08:02.478
WORK BEST FOR THEIR SITUATION

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:03.813
AND THEIR CHILD. RIGHT NOW I

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.181
GUESS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS A

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.182
LITTLE DIFFERENT WHICH IS YOU

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.883
KNOW THAT THAT'S- LIKE RIGHT NOW

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.318
WE'RE PLANTING THE SEEDS FOR

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.753
POTENTIALLY UNIVERSAL T. K. AND

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.055
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. RITE AID

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:13.856
AND IF THAT'S A FAIR WAY TO

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.959
DESCRIBE IT- I END THAT WORKS AS

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:17.660
LONG AS WE HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING

01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.562
TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD WE COME TO

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:21.230
A POINT WHERE MAYBE. THE FUNDING

01:08:21.297 --> 01:08:22.565
OUR REVENUES TAKE A DIFFERENT

01:08:22.631 --> 01:08:24.400
ROUTE NINETY FUNDS TAKE A DIP.

01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:26.502
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE-

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.703
YOU KNOW DEBBIE'S HAVE YOU

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:31.440
THOUGHT THROUGH SORT OF. WHETHER

01:08:31.507 --> 01:08:32.508
THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OR

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:33.442
THE OTHER AND WHY. YEAH I

01:08:33.509 --> 01:08:34.643
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.178
WITH WITH DETAIL ON WHAT A

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.080
PREFERENCE MIGHT BE IN THE

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.215
FUTURE- BECAUSE WE DON'T PREDICT

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:41.217
THAT AT THIS TIME- AND CERTAINLY

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:42.551
WE WOULD HAVE TO. YOU KNOW

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.420
ENGAGED THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR-

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:45.855
PERSPECTIVE STOPS IN A

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.324
CONVERSATION. SHOULD THAT

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.593
SITUATION OCCURRED. ON IT- LA-

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:55.865
DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS. I'M A BIG I THINK IF YOU'LL

01:08:55.931 --> 01:08:57.733
GET INSIDE IS YOUR ARE WITH THE

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.968
TIMING OF IT MATTERS AND THE

01:08:59.034 --> 01:09:00.402
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT I WOULD

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:03.272
SAY THAT- YOU KNOW. WHEN TICKETS

01:09:03.339 --> 01:09:04.874
IMPLEMENTED T. K. IS JUST PART

01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:07.076
OF ALTHEA- AND SO IF YOUR GOING

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.044
TO GET TO THAT POINT I DON'T I

01:09:09.111 --> 01:09:10.813
THINK. THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.381
JUST SORT OF SAYING WE'RE NOT

01:09:12.448 --> 01:09:13.582
GOING TO FUND THESE. THESE

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:14.984
CHILDREN ANYMORE WELL

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.285
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT YOU'RE

01:09:16.352 --> 01:09:17.920
NOT GONNA FIND A GROUP OF- GREAT

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:21.190
EXIST IS UNLIKELY SO NOW I WOULD

01:09:21.257 --> 01:09:22.925
SAY THAT IF WE DO IN THE IN A

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:23.726
RECESSION BUT THE TWO CHOICES

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:27.963
THAT YOU HAVE ARE. FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:29.732
IF THERE ARE THEY WERE NOT OING

TO PROVIDE WILL OFFER OF THE FF

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:33.335
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE REDUCTIONS

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.270
THAT WOULD BE A- BECAUSE THE

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:35.871
MARKETS ON THE SHOULD NOT

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:36.405
NECESSARILY FOCUS ON ONE

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.907
PARTICULAR AREA. WHERE MORE IT

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.608
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUT THESE TWO

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:40.976
KIND OF PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE TO

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:41.710
GO TO MAKE REDUCTIONS OF

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:44.213
MUSTARD. I AS I SAY I TELL YOU

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.481

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:46.982
EXPANSION ANTI K. WILL WILL

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:48.751
BASICALLY BAITED AND WILL HAVE

01:09:48.817 --> 01:09:49.985
NO CHOICE BUT IT'S IT'LL

01:09:50.052 --> 01:09:51.353
ESSENTIALLY. SHOULD WE HAVE

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.855
BUDGET ISSUES DOWN THE LINE IT

01:09:52.922 --> 01:09:53.956
WILL BE A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO K.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.190
AND PRESCHOOL IT IT'LL BE A

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.492
CHOICE BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF

01:09:56.559 --> 01:10:00.462
CARE- PRETTY K. THROUGH TWELVE

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.363

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:17.246
OP FACILITIES- ARE A BARRIER TO

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:19.949
EXPANDING TEAK IN THE SHORT RUN-

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.483

PURPOSE- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY OR

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:43.038

IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.747

I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE

01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:39.240
METRIC THAT THE FEDERAL

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:40.775
GOVERNMENT COLLECTS WHICH IS. A

WE AT LEAST TEN HOURS A WEEK OF.

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.753
BEING IN A SORT OF MORE FORMAL

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.988
REGULAR CLASSROOM. IN CALIFORNIA

THAN THAT AND THEN THE REST OF

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:05.467
THE COUNTRY- AND IN THE STATE

01:25:05.533 --> 01:25:06.935
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ITS OFFICES

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:07.535
THE WORK WE HAD RELATIVELY LOW

THE TAKING ADDITIONAL ACTIONS

01:25:15.543 --> 01:25:18.313
MAKE SENSE. I'M WE WILL ALSO

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:19.981
NOTE THAT DOES THE EXPANSION OF

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:20.782
TRADITIONAL CONVERTIBLE WILL

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:23.585
ALSO LIKELY INCREASE ACCESS- TO

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:25.186
PROGRAMS WHEN WE TALKED TO.

01:25:25.253 --> 01:25:26.454
SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER THE PAST

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:27.755
SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT HOW WE CAN

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:29.691
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF A FOUR

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:32.260
YEAR OLDS. WHO HAVE ACCESS TO A

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.928
TO A CONCERT PROGRAM ONE OF THE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.263
PRIMARY CONCERN THEY MENTIONED

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.232
WAS. THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

01:25:37.298 --> 01:25:38.066
ACCESS TO A PROGRAM FROM

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:39.100
DISTRICTS DON'T RUN THEIR OWN

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:48.610
STATE. PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:51.379
SOME SO THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE-

01:25:51.446 --> 01:25:53.982
A PROGRAM RUNS. GRADING HE CAME

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:54.883
ACROSS THE STATE WILL HELP IN

01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:56.584
THAT THEIR- SETTINGS HONORABLY.

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.286
FOR YEAR OLDS. ARE WE DO NOT

01:25:58.353 --> 01:26:00.855
THAT. WITH THAT THE PERCENT OF.

01:26:00.922 --> 01:26:02.323
IS A REASONABLE POINT BUT WE DO

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:03.358
THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:05.460
RE. THE IN A FEW YEARS. GIVEN

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:05.994
THE SIGNAL THING ABOUT ARE

PROGRAM AT THE PRESCHOOL FOLKS.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.704
WHAT WHAT- APPLE LOOKS LIKE IN

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.474
THE KIND OF THAT IF THAT ARE BIG

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:20.775
. PROGRAM WITH A- WHAT WE THINK

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:23.044
MAYBE A REASON. REQUIREMENT BE

01:26:23.111 --> 01:26:24.112
DRIVES THE SHOW CHILDREN

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:31.319
DISABILITY THAT IN IN THE PRIEST

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:32.554
- ALSO THE EXTENT THAT PROVIDERS

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.621
. DIFFICULT ABOUT THIS FOR.

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:35.223
BELOW THAT YOU WANT TO CONSIDER

WAYS TO. THE FROM. TO ADDRESS

THOSE. AND SORT OF AND

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.194
EVERYTHING. THAT WOULD IMPORTANT

01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:43.097
TO MONITOR ALL THE TIME. I'M

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:44.566

ON THIS ISSUE AND WE WONDER IF

01:27:15.263 --> 01:27:16.598
THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THE

01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:18.466
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO WAIT.

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.701
FOR A FEW MORE YEARS AFTER

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:36.951
CRITICAL FOR THOSE WHO ALSO

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:39.887
OPERATE AS A- CHOPPER. WHICH IS

01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:41.422

PRESCHOOL PRIORITIES. I WANNA

01:59:51.817 --> 01:59:52.552
MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE THE

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:54.654
FOREST FOR THE TREES- I SUPPORT

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.922
A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE

01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:57.590
GOVERNOR HAD A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:59:57.657 --> 02:00:00.660
HAS A PROPOSED- AT THE SAME TIME

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:01.661
I THINK WE KNOW WHAT A HIGH

02:00:01.727 --> 02:00:03.596
LEVEL- THAT OUR SCHOOLS IN

02:00:03.663 --> 02:00:05.498
CALIFORNIA BASIC INSTRUCTION CAN

02:00:05.565 --> 02:00:06.465
BE IMPROVED THERE'S A LOT OF

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.968
ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE- AND

02:00:09.035 --> 02:00:11.003
WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE TWO

02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:12.738
FACTORS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:14.941
IN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OUR

02:00:15.007 --> 02:00:15.908
CLASSROOMS SIZE AND TEACHER

02:00:15.975 --> 02:00:18.044
QUALITY- AND I WILL SAY THAT I

02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:19.946
AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED TO SEE

02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:20.780
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:00:20.846 --> 02:00:22.348
REALART HAS NOT ADDRESS THIS

02:00:22.415 --> 02:00:24.951
MORE HEAD ON. I AND IN A TIME

02:00:25.017 --> 02:00:26.052
WHEN WE DO HAVE BOUNTIFUL

02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:28.054
RESOURCES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:29.455
TO ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE EQUITY

02:00:29.522 --> 02:00:31.324
ANTI K. AND ANYTHING THE

02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:32.525
GOVERNMENT A GOVERNOR IS

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:34.827
ADDRESSING- BUT WE DO NEED TO

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:36.262
MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE

02:00:36.329 --> 02:00:38.264
SHORT UP AND NOW IS THE TIME WE

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:39.231
REALLY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING

02:00:39.298 --> 02:00:41.334
THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:42.868
MORE EMPHASIS PUT JUST ON

02:00:42.935 --> 02:00:45.071
INCREASING THE SHARE OF DIVINITY

02:00:45.137 --> 02:00:46.839
LCF AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT WE CAN

02:00:46.906 --> 02:00:48.507
GET TO THE HARD WORK OF REDUCING

02:00:48.574 --> 02:00:50.309
CLASS SIZES IMPROVING TEACHER

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:52.144
