00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.473
NOT QUITE OPPOSITION --

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:24.575
CONCERNS WINNERS YEAH YES DANIEL

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.110
SILVINO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:27.345
CENTER AGENCIES.

00:37:27.411 --> 00:37:28.446
CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:29.947
NONPROFIT REGIONAL CENTRES

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:31.415
COORDINATE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.950
FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.218
THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:34.819
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:35.186
THEIR FAMILIES.

00:37:35.252 --> 00:37:36.687
THOSE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.422
THE COMMUNITY BY NONPROFITS

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.724
USUALLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.292
HELP FOLKS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:44.362
DISABILITIES LIVE WORK PLAY VOTE

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:45.463
IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.765
OUR ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT IT

00:37:47.832 --> 00:37:49.667
UNINTENTIONAL INCLUDES A SECTION

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:50.701
CALLED THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.737
SECTION SCHEDULE THE TO MULFORD

00:37:52.803 --> 00:37:54.338
INSTITUTIONS CODE.

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:55.239
THOSE ARE HOLIDAYS THEIR

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:56.807
FURLOUGH DAYS THAT THE STATE PUT

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:59.043
FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AS

00:37:59.110 --> 00:37:59.944
ONE OF ITS BUDGET SOLUTIONS.

00:38:00.011 --> 00:38:01.679
SO THERE MANDATORY UNPAID DAYS

00:38:01.746 --> 00:38:02.580
OFF.

00:38:02.647 --> 00:38:03.381
SO ADDING ELECTION DAY TO THIS

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:06.617
LIST IS OTHER FOR LOW DAY HONOR

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:07.718
SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE HOPING.

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.353
I AN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.354
THE AUTHOR TO HAVE THE SECTION

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:11.155
REMOVED --

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.690
SINCE IT IS ACCIDENTALLY

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:14.291
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:38:14.358 --> 00:38:16.794
FURLOUGH DAYS HONOR SOCIETY IN

00:38:16.861 --> 00:38:18.195
OUR COMMUNITY SO --

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:18.796
THAT GLAD THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:38:18.863 --> 00:38:20.231
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT.

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:22.667
ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:25.369
CONCERN OR OPPOSITION.

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.672
SING NUMBER IN BACK TO

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:29.140
COLLEAGUES THIS MYTH.

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:30.107
THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:32.109
IN IN CALIFORNIA DOES EVERY

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:34.245
COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE FOR

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:39.450
A MALE AND A BALLOT.

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:40.418
BECAUSE WHEN I GET THE REASON I

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.420
ASK IS I GET MY MAIL IN BALLOT

00:38:42.486 --> 00:38:43.554
AND I HAVE BEEN A PERMANENT

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:45.523
ABSENTEE BALLOT.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:47.491
SINCE I WAS SOME FORTY ONE NOW I

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:50.528
THINK I WAS IN MY MID TWENTIES --

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:51.629
WHEN I WAS --

00:38:51.696 --> 00:38:52.863
WHEN I STARTED BEING A PERMIT

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.031
MAIL -- BUT

00:38:54.098 --> 00:38:55.766
THE ABSENTEE VOTER.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.134
AND I GET MY ABOUT ALMOST A

00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:58.536
MONTH --

00:38:58.602 --> 00:38:59.804
BEFORE ELECTION DAY.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.106
AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.775
NECESSARY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE HAVE

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.210
ACCESS TO THE POLLS THEY GET

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:07.611
THEIR BALLOT BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:08.846
TO TURN IT IN SOME JUST.

00:39:08.913 --> 00:39:09.947
WONDERING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.282
EVERYBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO BE

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:12.416
ABLE TO GET A PERMIT ABSENTEE

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:13.284
BALLOT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.385
THIS IS.

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:17.588
NECESSARY IF THAT'S THE CASE.

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:18.389
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS ANY

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:21.625
VOTER CALIFORNIA CAN REQUEST --

00:39:21.692 --> 00:39:24.328
BERMAN ABSENTEE BALLOT.

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:25.730
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME POINT AND

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.732
AND AND I'LL I'LL SUPPORT THIS

00:39:27.798 --> 00:39:28.632
FOR NOW BUT I THOUGHT AT SOME

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:31.235
POINT EVERYONE WE ABSENTEE

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.236
BALLOTS.

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:37.241
WITH THE REQUESTED OR NOT.

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:38.075
THIS ORDER CENTER.

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:40.344
SO IN KING COUNTY IS A MOVE TO

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:41.445
VOTERS CHOICE ACT THE VOTING

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:42.446
RIGHTS ACT MODEL EVERY COUNTY

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:43.681
EVERY VOTER IN THOSE COUNTIES

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:45.416
GET THE ABSENTEE BALLOT NOT

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.418
EVERY COUNTY GUYS DON'T HAVE TO

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.519
MOVE TO THAT MODEL.

00:39:48.586 --> 00:39:50.321
IT'S IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:51.355
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO ARE

00:39:51.422 --> 00:39:53.023
THE COUNTIES MOVING TO THE MODEL

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:55.826
OF THE VOTING CENTERS THE ALLY.

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:56.494
YEAH BUT I THOUGHT WHICH IS GIVE

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.328
THEM.

00:39:57.394 --> 00:40:00.064
MANY DAYS A HIT TO VOTE YES THAT

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:00.898
THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:02.099
THOUGHT AND I'LL I'LL.

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.701
NOT SUPPORT IS NOW BUT I THINK

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.236
ITH THE KIND OF CHANGES WE'VE

00:40:05.302 --> 00:40:06.971
MADE IN THE LAST --

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:09.306
I DON'T THREE TWO THREE YEARS

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.908
ALMOST MAKES THIS SOMEWHAT

00:40:10.975 --> 00:40:13.110
UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE FACT

00:40:13.177 --> 00:40:14.345
THAT WE DO HAVE --

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.813
THE VOTING CENTERS THAT ARE OPEN

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.715
IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN LIBRARIES

00:40:17.782 --> 00:40:19.049
AND ALL KINDS OF PLACES THE

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:21.685
PEOPLE CAN BEGIN TO VOTE EARLY --

00:40:21.752 --> 00:40:23.821
WE OF EARLY VOTING WE HAVE A

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:25.489
BALLOT THE CENTERS WE CAN DROP

00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:27.158
THE BALLOT OFF AT THE LIBRARY

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:31.562
THIS THIS THIS SO.

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:33.898
YOU KNOW I AND AND SO I I DON'T

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:35.766
KNOW WHETHER IT'S IT'S NECESSARY

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:36.500
AT THIS POINT --

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.269
TO THEN HAVE A HOLIDAY THAT ON

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:39.436
THAT DAY BECAUSE IF.

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:40.004
WHERE THE HOPE IS THAT MOST

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.671
FOLKS WILL OF VOTED BEFORE THAT

00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:42.139
DAY BUT ALSO THAT THERE WILL BE

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:43.541
ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

00:40:43.607 --> 00:40:45.109
AVAILABLE WITH ITS SUNDAY OR

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.844
MONDAY OR SATURDAY WHEN PEOPLE

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.145
GO TO THE VOTING CENTER SELF?

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:49.547
AND I KNOW MOST COUNTIES IN

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:51.115
MOVING TOWARD IT IT IN SAN DIEGO

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:51.949
EVERYBODY GETS AN ABSENT

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.884
ABSENTEE BALLOT THEY CAN USE

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.452
THAT OR NOT BUT THEY GET.

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:57.621
ONE AND SOUL --

00:40:57.688 --> 00:41:01.859
SO I DON'T EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:03.594
AND THIS ISN'T AN EXPENSE OUT I

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.062
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.063
HAVE ALL THESE HOLIDAYS PAID FOR

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.398
THE AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:08.966
ALL IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.501
THINGS WE'VE DONE SO I THINK

00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:11.969
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD THINK ABOUT

00:41:12.036 --> 00:41:13.537
THAT A LITTLE BIT OF BECAUSE

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.040
WE'VE DONE A LOT ALREADY.

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.208
TO OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:18.843
VOTE SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:20.778
BE ONE DAY AND ONE DAY ONLY YOU

00:41:20.845 --> 00:41:22.313

00:41:22.379 --> 00:41:23.647
THAT THIS ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE

00:41:23.714 --> 00:41:26.217
THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE.

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.852
ACCESS TO THOSE GROUPS NEW

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:28.452
VOTING CENTERS THAT ARE COMMON

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:29.253

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.857
NEED FOR IT EARLIER BUT I'M NOT

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:33.457
SURE IF IT'S STILL STAYS THERE

00:41:33.524 --> 00:41:35.659

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:41.332
DIRECTION --

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.167

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:21.939
WHERE VOTING OCCURS OVER A

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:23.641
PERIOD OF TIME --

THINK UNNECESSARY --

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:40.291
AT THIS TIME --

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.960
BUT JUST BE.

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:44.261
MIGHT BE A NECESSARY DOESN'T

FROM YOU WHY YOU THINK.

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:08.652

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:28.278

00:53:07.117 --> 00:53:08.585
TO MAKE THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.153

MAKE THESE REPORTS AVAILABLE TO
