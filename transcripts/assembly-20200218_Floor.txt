DR ED WHEN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK UGH THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER A MEMBERS- TODAY I RISE ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS. BUT AS I RISE ON BEHALF OF LATINO CAUCUS I THINK ABOUT INTERSECTION MELANIE BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AROUND THIS FLOOR IN THIS CHAMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK LIKE A BLEND OF WHAT IS EVERYTHING IS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT CALIFORNIA IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I COULD STAND YOUR MEMBERS AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBT CAUCUS AND I CAN TALK ABOUT THOSE STRIDES WE'VE MADE BUT I CAN ALSO TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. WILL BE NO THAT L. G. ESPECIALLY OF PEOPLE OF COLOR BROWN AND BLACK FACE GREATER RISKS OF MURDER. OF RAPE. POVERTY THAN ANY OTHER GROUP I COULD STAND HERE ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND SPEAK ABOUT HISTORICALLY HAD IS BEEN BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN THAT HAVE RALLIED BEHIND THE EFFORTS OFTENTIMES IN SILENCE WE CAN THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE ROSA PARKS WE CAN THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE THE LOWER SWEAR TO. WE CAN THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE SHIRLEY CHISHOLM WE CAN THINK ABOUT IN MY OWN COMMUNITY A PATRICIA HATTON AN OBGYN CLINICIAN WHO'S BEEN WORKING WITH BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HER ENTIRE LIFE BUT TODAY I STAND ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS AND I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE STILL WE'VE MADE HUGE STRIDES OFTEN BEHIND THE SCENES A LOT OF TIMES IN FRONT OF THE STANDS. AND I THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES AGAIN OF INTERSECTION AUDI WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE LIVE IN AREAS WHERE POLLUTION IS HIGHER WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN EOPLE LIVE IN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE LESS ACCESS TO WATER WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE OFTEN LIVE IN ZIP CODES THEY DIE SOONER THAN THEIR CALL THANKS HELLO THIS IS NOT THE BINDER BY SOCIOECONOMIC BUT OFTEN JUST ON ISSUES OF RACE. SO AS WE STATE SO EIGHT BLACK WE STAND FOR YES THAT IS HEARD THE PER THAT HAS MADE THE PATH THAT WE CAN TO STRIVE AND WE THAT WE MAKE THOSE BY BEST GOING WITH WHO'S WHO FOR THE SAME SITUATION THAT WE FACE WHEN WE AND WITH OUR- BROTHER SISTER ARE LOOKING OVER THE SERBS THE WOMEN OF ALL DÃ¢N ALL OF US TOGETHER SO I BY SIDE BE WE KNOW. GATHER MEMBERS WE STOP. MATH FOR OTHERS TO CONTINUE THE PATH THAT WE- WILL HELP LAY. ON BEHALF OF THE LATINO CAUCUS I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU DOCTOR EGGMAN MISTER CHIU YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I ALSO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE P. I. LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. EVERY FAVOR A WE REFLECT AND RECOGNIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES THE LEGACY THE STRUGGLES THE CHALLENGES. ARE BUT LIKE OUR COLLEAGUE FROM STOCKTON- MANY OF US ALSO THINK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION ALLEY OF THESE ISSUES. ONE OF MY FAVORITE EVENTS IN MY DISTRICT DURING THIS MONTH IS A CELEBRATION OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITH THE CHINESE LUNAR NEW YEAR. AND IT'S NOT JUST A CELEBRATION OF CULTURE IT'S NOT JUST TO SPUR CELEBRATION OF SOCIAL COMMUNITIES. IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT BEFORE THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT AND THE JAPANESE AMERICAN INTERNMENT THERE WAS SLAVERY THERE WERE JIM CROW LAWS. THE FACT THAT OUR STRUGGLES ARE INTERLINKED THE FACT THAT THE TRIUMPHS OF OUR COMMUNITIES ARE REFLECTED. IN HISTORY BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WOULD NOT BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT FOR AN ORGANIZATION IN SAN FRANCISCO- ROOTED IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY. THAT DECIDED TO TAKE IN A LAW STUDENT I SOME TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO AN ORGANIZATION WHERE I WORKED CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY. THOSE OF US THAT REPRESENT DIVERSITY OFFICE BODY WE WOULD NOT BE HERE BUT FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT BUT FOR THE RIGHTS FIGHT LED BY OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN LEADERS. AND HE NOT ONLY ARE COMMEMORATING HISTORY BUT WE ARE COMMITTED ARE SO. WE HAVE ECONOMIC. FOR ALL HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. EDUCATION FOR ALL IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL SO WITH THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR API IT LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. I STRONGLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER TO MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AS THE LEADER OF THE ASSEMBLY REPUBLICAN CAUCUS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR ONE FIFTY FIVE HONORING BLACK HISTORY MONTH. THE STORY TO A REMARKABLE INDIVIDUALS AND COUNTLESS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SOCIETY AND TO CIVIL RIGHTS BY THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY ARE SO NUMEROUS AND HAVE POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR NATION IN FACT THEY ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION ALL HERE. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DEDICATE THE MONTH OFFEBRUARY EACH YEAR TO STUDYING RECOGNIZING AND CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FOR THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION. AND CHEN AYE VOTE ON THIS ACR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER DEBATE ON THIS MEASURE DOCTOR WEBER YOU MAY CLOSE. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR- CELEBRATING THIS PARTICULAR ACR. WITH THE STATEMENTS BY THE VARIOUS CAUCUSES CONCERNING WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU AND WHAT IT MEANS TO ALL OF US. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN- EIGHT YEARS. SINCE I BEGAN DISCUSSING BLACK HISTORY ON THE FLOOR OF THIS HOUSE. AND I BEGAN TO ASK MYSELF AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS WHAT CAN I SAY TO YOU TODAY. THAT IS DIFFERENT. MY FRIENDS OFTEN TEASE ME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AN EDUCATOR FOR FORTY EIGHT YEARS. AND THEY SAY EVERY TIME I OPEN MY MOUTH I'M ALWAYS TEACHING FOLKS SOMETHING. IT'S IN MY DNA IT'S WHO I AM. AND SO I FIND IT DIFFICULT NOT TO. HOPEFULLY SHARE SOMETHING WITH YOU THAT'S IMPORTANT. BUT AS I THINK ABOUT THE EIGHT YEARS THAT WE HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION HERE ABOUT BLACK HISTORY. I THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. I THINK BE CONSTANT EFFORT TO SAY TO YOU OVER AND OVER HOW IMPORTANT HISTORY IS IN AMERICA. THAT IT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARACTER IS NOT JUST THE GIVING OF INFORMATION. BUT IT'S REALLY THE SHAPING OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT ONE'S INCLUSION. AND ONCE EXCLUSION FROM HISTORY SPEAKS VOLUMES BUT THAT INDIVIDUAL AND FOR THEIR FAMILY AND WHO THEY ARE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT AND WE ASK OURSELVES THE CONSTANT QUESTION WHY IS THIS EXCLUSION STILL THERE. WE HAVE TO ASK WHAT WAS THE INTENT IN THE FIRST PLACE FOR THE SOLUTION. AND AS WE LOOK AT IT THEN WE CAN SEE THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON PEOPLE'S POSSIBILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES. AND THEIR CHILDREN'S POSSIBILITY IN OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE'VE HAD SO MANY DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THAT. I'VE ALSO ASK YOU TO WONDER WHAT THE WORLD WOULD LOOK LIKE. IF WE HAD KNOWN CERTAIN BITS OF HISTORY. IF WE HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE HIDDEN FIGURES. WOULD WE BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN BEING IN STEM BECAUSE WOMEN WOULD PROBABLY ONLY STEM. AND SURELY WOMEN OF COLOR WOULD OWN STEM IN OWN SCIENCE. SO THE LACK OF THAT INFORMATION- THAT MISINFORMATION OF NOT BELIEVING THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE A ROLE IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE. HAS CAUSED US TO SPEND LOTS AND LOTS OF MONEY OF TRYING TO TELL WOMEN YOU CAN DO MATH. YOU CAN DO SCIENCE. WHEN THEY THE OWNERS OF IT. AND THEY SHOULD BE THE ONES DRIVE IT. AND WE ASK WHAT WOULD THE WORLD LOOK LIKE IF WE HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WOULD BE. AND I EVEN ASK MYSELF AND MY STAFF CONSTANTLY WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT HISTORY I WENT RECENTLY TO SEE. THE MOVIE. AND I CAME BACK AND I SAID WHAT DO THINK ABOUT IT AS A HISTORIAN I BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT THE ACCURACY OF THE MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS ACCURATE I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD MOVIE. AND ONE OF MY MEMBERS SAID TO ME YOU KNOW HOW. THEY HAD A THEY HAD FRIENDS WHO DIDN'T LIKE HERE. THEY SAID WHY. SAID BECAUSE WHITES HAD A ROLE IN IT AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHITE PEOPLE. WHAT ABOUT BLACK PEOPLE. AND I ONCE AGAIN HAD TO REMIND THEM THAT THE HISTORY OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. WAS NOT JUST ABOUT BLACK DETERMINATION TO BE FREE. BUT WAS ALSO ABOUT THE COLLABORATORS THE WHITES WHO COULD NOT STAND THE SYSTEM AND FOUND WAYS TO PARTICIPATE. AND IF THEY HAD KNOWN THEIR HISTORY AND HAD LOOKED UP A BOOK LIKE WITHOUT SANCTUARY ABOUT LYNCHING OF THIS COUNTRY. THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN PICTURES OF WHITE MOTHERS AND WHITE CHILDREN LYNCHED ALONG SIDE OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THEY WERE SYMPATHIZERS. THE WHITE SOMETIMES RESTED THEIR FAMILIES THE RESOURCES SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY COULD NO LONGER STAND IN AN UNJUST SYSTEM. AND IF WE KNOW THAT. THAT MIGHT MOTIVATE US SOME POWER TO LOOK FOR OTHER COLLABORATORS IN COOPERATORS AND OTHERS TO STAND WITH US. ON ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE SO AND JUST. THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE SO MANY OF YOU ONE THREE NINE TWO. BECAUSE 85% MEANT THAT MOST OF US WERE NOT AFRICAN AMERICANS WOULD NOT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SOLVE THE INJUSTICE AND DECIDED TO STAY AT. IT'S ALL BECOMES IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HISTORY THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THAT. AND SO AS I THINK ABOUT WHAT AM I GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY. ABOUT HISTORY. AND THEN I HAD TO REMIND MYSELF WHAT I TOLD YOU LAST YEAR. I LIVE FOR THE DAY. WHEN WE DON'T HAVE BLACK HISTORY MONTH. WHEN BLACK HISTORY MONTH IS NO MORE THAN A HISTORICAL STATEMENT OF WHAT WE USED TO DO. THAT WE WANT CELEBRATED HISTORY FOR JUST A MONTH. BUT LOOK AT IS NOW. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A CURRICULUM. THAT ENCOMPASSES ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THAT REALLY PROVIDES FOR US THE NECESSARY INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO GROW AND TO DEVELOP. AND I KNOW THAT SO IT SEEMS LIKE A PIE IN THE SKY. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN IN MUST HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO I THINK OF THAT BECAUSE I THINK OF TWO BILLS THAT YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU HAVE SEEN. AND I LOOK AT THE CONFLICT AND THE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE IN THOSE BILLS THAT HAVE NOT COME ABOUT. AND WE REALLY MUST ASK OURSELVES VERY HONESTLY WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP WE TAKE. OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST STEP WE TAKE IS TO BASICALLY LOOK AT OUR UNIVERSITIES AND SAY ARE WE PREPARING OUR TEACHERS. TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN SO THEY HAVE THE COMPLETE PICTURE OF HISTORY AND NOT JUST A PIECE OF IT. AND IT TAKES TIME TO DO THAT. BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS WITHOUT THE FIRST STEP. AND SO MY GOAL IN TERMS OF BLACK HISTORY IS HAVING TAUGHT IT NOW FOR FORTY EIGHT YEARS AS A UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR AND CHAIRMAN DEPARTMENT AT A NATIONAL PERSON. DEALING WITH BLACK STUDIES. IS TO WORK SO THAT WHEN WE TALK OF HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN WE TALK OF HISTORY IN THE UNITED STATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALL OF US. AND OUR CHILDREN ARE EMPOWERED. BECAUSE THEY SEE NOT ONLY THE STRUGGLE OF ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE TO BE FREE. THEY UNDERSTAND THE PRECIOUSNESS OF FREEDOM. AND THEY ALSO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING IT HAPPEN. IT IS A THING THAT IS NOW TIME THAT WE STOP DOING THE CELEBRATION ONCE A MONTH. A BLACK HISTORY IN CHICAGO HISTORY IN WHATEVER THAT WE STOP DOING THAT. THAT WE MARK THIS TIME SAYS THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE USED TO DO THAT. BUT TO DAY. THIS TIME WE DO IT RIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU I BOUGHT A NAY C. R. ONE FIFTY FIVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT POTENT CLOSE DOCTOR WEBER. ALL THE BAY HAVING CEASED WE WILL MOVE TO A VOTE ON THE MEASURE THE FIRST ROLL CALL WILL BE FOR CO AUTHORS ON ACR ONE FIVE FIVE THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. THIS IS FOR A CO AUTHOR.
