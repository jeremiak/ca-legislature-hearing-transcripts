WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE YOU. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LAYERED MORNING SENATOR MAN AND WE LOOK FORWARD- TO- A TROUBLE UP ON- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TO BE A PART OF YOUR CONVERSATION- AS I. PREPARE MY ROOM. I AM CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS RELEASED THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE MILLION CASES IN MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES. NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT THIS MUST BE THE TOUGHEST EXPERIENCE AND MOST OF US WILL EXPERIENCE IN OUR LIFETIME. I WANT TO COMMEND EVERYONE UP FOR ALL THAT THEY'RE DOING. FOR US TO BEGIN TO SEE SOME OF THE SEARCH DECLINING BUT YET WE KNOW THAT WE ARE STILL IN A PERIOD WHERE WE MUST PARTICIPATE THE MOST CAUTIOUS WAYS I WANT TO COMMEND. OUR STUDENTS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO I TRY TO LEARN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE FOR SURE SAFETY IS A QUESTION AND SECOND NOT ALL THE TOOLS EXIST COULD MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. LET'S FACE IT OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS NOT BUILT TO DEAL WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IT WAS NOT BUILT TO BE LARGELY ONLINE AND WE KNOW THAT WE ESTIMATED MAYBE 70% OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE IN REMOTE. MODES AT WHILE MANY OTHERS HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OLD BRANCH OFTEN IN HIGH. BUT BUT WE OUR SYSTEM BUILT FOR ANY OF THIS- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK THE MILLIONS OF STUDENTS DON'T HAVE A TO HIGH SPEED. TEACHERS AND TRY ON TO REALLY MAKE THEM. OF DISTANCE LEARNING BUT YEAH WE FIND OURSELVES DOING JUST THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AND WE KNOW THAT MANY ARE- EXPERIENCE A HIGHER RATE OF DETECTION RISK. BECAUSE OF PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS. AND SO AGAIN I COMMEND OUR STUDENTS THEIR EDUCATORS THEIR PARENTS- FOR THEIR RESILIENCE DURING THESE TOUGH TIMES- THEY'VE EXPERIENCED THE PANDEMIC THEY'VE EXPERIENCED FIRES THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. MUDSLIDES THE HAVE EXPERIENCE IN FACT YOU SO LOS TO. NATURAL DOES- THE- REYES. THANK YOU OF GEORGE FLOYD IN A ACTS OF HATE WATCHING. THOSE WHITES. STORM MARK. OF THE THREATEN THE PEACE TRANSFER OF POWER. INTO SEE INCREASE IN SPITE HATE OUR STUDENTS ARE WITNESSED ALL OF THIS THEIR DEAL WITH ALL. AND THE DIGITAL. THAT WE WILL STUDENTS GO WITHOUT. IN AND ACCESS UNIT FOR SOME YEARS HAS BEEN ON COVER. AS AN EMBARRASSING FACT CALIFORNIA AND IN EVERY STATE THIS NATION WE MY CLOSE DIGITAL DIVIDE. OUR OFFICE WERE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE THINGS THIS. OUR SCHOOLS- ALONG TASK TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL. WE PROVIDED THAT YOU KNOW OUR OF THAT OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND BINARY WITH- TOMORROW WILL HAVE A- TASK FORCE HEARING FOCUSED ON. MAJOR SOLUTION TO CALL. THE DID DIVIDE AND PROTECT BROAD. CONCERN WE HEAR FROM A NUMBER OF. OFFICERS ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES TO THE SENATE YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL IN A FEW. IN THE ASSEMBLY. WE'VE WORKED A FULL ON PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH. STUDENT TASK. AND ALSO PROVIDE DIRECT WEBINARS FEEL ON A DRESSING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEED. OF OUR STUDENTS ORG- WE HELD FIELD WIDE WEB IN OUR ABOUT EDUCATE ON ITS ADDRESS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. TRANSPORTATION TO HAVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT SO THAT FAMILIES ARE CONNECTED TO SCHOOL- IN THIS TIME WE KNOW IT LITERALLY LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. ARE DISCONNECTED- WE'VE LITERALLY BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT CHECKED IN. TO HELP. FIND WAYS TO GET THEM RECONNECTED IN SCHOOL SO THAT'S WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES AS WE REVIEW THIS BUDGET. THIS IS A GREAT BUDGET- BUT BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT HAS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. FOR TEACHER DEVELOPMENT WORKFORCE PREPARATION OF COAL FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HELP THEM WITH THE RISING COST. BINDING FOR TO SCHOOLS UPWARDS OF TWO HUNDRED FIVE MILLION THE- ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS WE GONNA HELP PROGRAM. THIS IS THE HIGH LEVEL THAT WE HAVE SEEN. WITH EIGHTY FIVE POINT EIGHTY BILLION IMPROPER NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS AND SO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS SICK. BUT WILL MUST TALK ABOUT. THE PART OF THE BUDGET THAT DEALS. REOPENING AND THAT THIS BUDGET AND- TWO BILLION. A CO TESTS. IN RELATED MATTERS IT ALSO ENVISIONS- ANOTHER A BILLION THAT WOULD DEAL WITH WHAT WE CALL EXPLORATION OF LEARNING OSSINING LEARNING GAPS. MORE PROGRAMS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY MORE SUPPORT AND OF COURSE SUMMER PROGRAMS AND SO- WELL THERE ARE CONCERNS- ABOUT MANY PARTS OF THE RE OPENING BUDGET- WE BELIEVE THAT THE CENTERPIECE IS WHAT SCHOOLS NEED. LET'S FACE IT GETTING ACCESS TO THE BACK IS THE GAME TO THAT ALREADY. NEED AND WITHOUT ANOTHER DOSES FROM THE GOVERNMENT WE TERM FOR. TO THE THING THAT WE CAN MANAGING COLD TESTING. ROBUST COVERT TESTING FOR ADULTS AND STUDENTS TO CREATE A PATH. FOR SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT OPEN TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS WE'VE SPOKEN WITH MANY OF YOU WE'VE SPOKEN WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES WE SPOKE WITH SUPERINTENDENTS. AND WE SHARED FEEDBACK WITH THE GOVERNOR TOGETHER STAFF I KNOW THAT GOVERNOR STAFF HAVE BEEN. CAR WITH THE ASSOCIATE OF SUPER. WE LABOR LEADERS WITH SUPERINTEND. AND STAFF TRY AND FIGURE OUT IT AND LEGISLATORS TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE IT'S NOT PERFECT. AND OBVIOUSLY WE'RE ON DEADLINE IT NEEDS TO BE REVISED I LEVELS COME. ARE TAKING PLACE- I WOULD SAY GIVE SCHOOLS WHAT THEY NEED THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED FOR COVERT TESTING TO GET OPEN THE KNOW HOW ON HOW TO DO IT AND HELP. IN MOVE THOSE RESOURCES BECAUSE LET'S FACE OUR SCHOOLS HAVE NEVER BEEN BILL TO PROVIDE COVER TESTING ON SITE AND WE TO HELP THEM- BY PROVIDING FINANCIAL RESOURCES. AND. NEW HOW. TO DO SO- PUT IT IN A START MORE. THE YOU SEE CHAIR AND I'D BE. TO A QUICK- FROM YOU- OR FROM ANY OF THE MEN OF YOUR TO.

MAKING THOSE SCHOOLS HOLE EVEN IF THEY TAKEN A LARGE COSTS- TO TRY TO REOPEN. YES CENTER I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF DISTRICTS IN YOUR AIR THAT HAVE A OPEN AND WORKED TO STAY OPEN. WE BEHALF TO WORK WITH THEM ON WHATEVER THEIR ALLEY.

THANK YOU TAKE CARE WE WILL TO- AND NOW WE'RE GOING MOVE TO ISSUE TWO WHAT IS THE PROPER NINE EIGHT OVERVIEW IN STRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO PAY TO ADDRESS THIS WE ASK ANY. ERIN READY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF. AND CAN CAP AND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE AND OFFICE AND- I SEE THEM ON THE SCREEN SO THAT'S PERFECT WELCOME TO THE- TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS INTERNET AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND TODAY I'LL BE PRESENTING YOU WITH A BRIEF BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEES CALCULATION AND THE K. TWELVE PACKAGE. THERE IN SPECIFICALLY. SO COMPARED TO TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES AS YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD HAMMERING REBOUNDED BY QUITE AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT ALMOST SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- COMPARED TO WHERE WE THOUGHT THINGS WOULD BE AT THE BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S DUE. MOSTLY TO CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESSIVE TAX STRUCTURE ALONG WITH UNFORESEEN HEALTH OF THE STOCK MARKET AND CAPITAL GAINS AGAIN ALL RELATIVE TO WHERE WE THOUGHT THINGS WOULD BE AT THE BUDGET ACT- WITH TEST ONE BEING OPERATIVE IN EACH YEAR THE GUARANTEE CALCULATION CULTURE PROBABLY NEED TO RECEIVE. ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR OF AN INCREASE OR DECREASE THE TO REVENUES PLUS. LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GUARANTEED. IS OUT ABOUT SEVENTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE COMPARED TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY ESTIMATE WE HAD AT THE BUDGET ACT. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS ABOUT ELEVEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS COMPARED TO THE ENACTED LEVEL FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THE BUDGET ACT FOR A TOTAL AMOUNT OF EIGHTY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. THE INCREASE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE ENACTED LEVEL FOR TWENTY ONE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE EXCUSE ME- FOR TOTAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATION OF EIGHTY FIVE. POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. NOW AT THE BUDGET ACT YOU MAY RECALL THAT IN RECOGNITION OF THE EXTREME DROP IN THE GUARANTEE THAT WE WERE EXPECTING BECAUSE OF THE DROP IN REVENUES THAT WAS PROJECTED AT THE TIME- TRAILER BILL LEGISLATION WAS ADOPTED TO REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS BEGINNING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THAT WOULD BE MADE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE PROPERTY NEED MINIMUM GUARANTEE CALCULATION- AND THOSE PAYMENTS WOULD BE EQUAL TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF TOTAL SELL GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND THERE WOULD ALSO BE. A- TEST ONE SHARE REVENGE TO BRING THE SHARE OF- GENERAL FUND REVENUES THAT GO TOWARDS ROUTE NINETY EIGHT IN A TEST TWENTY FROM EIGHT PER. 42% ON AN ONGOING BASIS CURRENTLY INCREASING THE TEST ONE CALCULATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS. NOW WITH REVENUE SIGNIFICANTLY RECOVERED AS I MENTIONED THE PROBABLY NEED TRAJECTORY AS MUCH BACK ON A MUCH HEALTHIER- PASSENGER THEN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED. THE FOR ELIMINATING MUCH OF THE- DROP IN FUNDING A NECESSITY TO THE CAR THE CONVERSATION AROUND SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE BACK IN JUNE. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A ONE TIME PAYMENT INSTEAD IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO ONLY AT WITH NO PAYMENTS NOW YEARS AND ALSO NO- ONGOING TEST ONE PERCENTAGE REDUCTION SO THAT PAYMENT INTO. ONE TWENTY TWO IS EQUAL TO ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN AGAIN THAT'S ONE OF A HALF PER. OF THE CURRENT. OF CELL FROM RED. IN THE BY YEAR- AND WITH A PAYMENT. WOULD IS MADE ON TOP THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED. ARE A TOTAL PROPOSED- TWENTY ONE. NINE EIGHT FUND LEVEL WOULD BE A EIGHT POINT BILLION DOLLARS OR INCREASE OF. POINT TWO BILLION. OVER THE TWO TWENTY FISCAL YEAR ENACTED LEVEL AT THE BUDGET. BUILDING ON TO- SOMETHING CALL THE PROMENADE RESERVE PUBLIC SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT- WHOSE SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT EXCUSE ME BUT THAT WAS PART OF PROPOSITION TWO- AND- AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE ARE. ESTIMATING THAT IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THERE ARE BE DEPOSIT YOUR CHOIR PURSUANT TO THAT CONSTITUTIONALLY WITHIN THE PROPOSITION TO- WORTH SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THOUSAND RESULTS OF THIS IS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ALREADY- THAT BALANCE OF ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS IN EXCESS OF THE 3% RESERVE BALANCE TRIGGER SO 3% OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY TOTAL- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND ONE THAT RESERVE BALANCE TRIGGER THRESHOLD IS MET IT WOULD REQUIRE US SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE OF CAPS TO GO INTO EFFECT BEGINNING IN. FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THE BUDGET. ALSO INCLUDES ELEVEN TO DOLLARS IN CAGE A PORSCHE FOR. THIRTY MONTHS FEDERAL THROUGH. OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS NOW PROPOSING TO FULLY RETIRE THESE REFERRALS IN MONTHS JULY THROUGH NOVEMBER WHICH ON MONTHS THAT ARE SPECIFIED IN STATUTE THAT THEY WERE TO BE RETIRED- AND WE WILL NOT BE HAVING TO. READ DEFERRED THOSE- AT AGAIN AND IN THE MONTHS- OF FEBRUARY THROUGH. JUNE AS WE WOULD HAVE HAD WE NOT BEEN PROPOSING TO RETIRE NOW. BUT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL- DEFERRAL ESTIMATED CURRENTLY AT THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN JUNE TWENTY TWO. TWENTY THREE FOR A NET BUDGETARY COST IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF ABOUT SEVEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOTAL NET PAY DOWN- IN. THE SAVINGS THAT'S RESULTING. N. F. TO- PROVIDING WITH. TO SAFELY REACH. WHEN APPROACHED AND ALSO DIRECTORIES TOWARDS STUDENTS AT BY BE MOST ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY PANDEMIC OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO DOES FROM SIX POINT SIX BILLION ONE TIME. IMMEDIATE EARLY ACTION BOZELL AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE AND THESE PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN SOME OTHER COMMITTEES AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE DISCUSSED AS WELL BUT I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT- ONGOING COSTS FOR COAL INCREASES ON THE LCF ANOTHER CONTROL PROGRAMS EQUAL ABOUT. TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL OTHER ADDITION ADDITIONAL- SPENDING PROPOSALS THAT WE CAN DISCUSS. LATER ON IN MORE DETAIL AND HALFPENNY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT- FROM NARAL ALL AND MAKE COMMENTS AND- AND LIKE I SAID HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY. PARTICULAR ISSUES YOU WANT TO DIVE INTO FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. FIRST AND THEN ASK QUESTIONS OF BOTH OF YOU WHEN THAT HAPPENED SO. THEN WE CAN GO TO A CAN CAP ON FROM THE L. A. L. WELCOME. TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN. CAN COUPON WITH THE END OF THE OFFICE. IN THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE YOU A GOOD. OF THIS YEAR'S. SO I'LL ADD A FEW. AND THEN TRY TO OUR CAR. YES HAVE A HANDOUT. A AND THAT'S AVAILABLE WEBSITE. ELADIO THE CA DOCTOR. THE STAR WITH THE- NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THE- ARE THE CURRENT ARE ARE QUITE A- THE ELEVENTH NINE BILL. IN IN THE TWENTY TWO ONE GET. REPRESENTS AN IN. OF SEVEN CHRIS. CAN TO THE ESTIMATES FROM LAST YEAR. BY A VERY WIDE MARGIN THAT'S A LARGE MAN YOU'RE- IN THE HISTORY PROFITS. NINETY EIGHT. MOST OF THE NEW PROPOSALS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ARE RELATED TO MEETING THAT HIGHER GUARANTEED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY. THAT GROWTH CONTINUES IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE GUARANTEE AND- BY A DENTIST THREE. OVER THERE OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ABOVE HIGHER CHEN FUND UP. AND GROWTH AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. IN ADDITION AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED THERE'S A TWO POINT THREE BILLION. A PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ON TOP OF THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED. ALL THE OF FINANCE MEANT THAT BILLION PROPERTY NINETY EIGHT RESERVE DEPOSIT AND THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT TRIGGERS A CAP ON SCHOOL DISTRICT RESERVES STARTING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THAT CAP IS EQUAL ANNUAL EXPENDITURE IT IS. BECAUSE THE CAPPING SOUNDS DISTRICTS OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR FEWER STUDENTS THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY EXEMPT FROM THE CAP. BUT BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THE LATEST DATA FROM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEDIUM AND LARGE DISTRICTS OF RESERVES THAT EXCEED THE 10% CAP. DISTRICTSMIGHT RESPOND TO THIS CAPEN VARIOUS WAYS THEY CAN BE CLASSIFIED TO RESERVES TO AVOID TO CAP. OR THEY COULD. YOU CAN EXEMPTION FROM THE COUNTY OFFICES OFFICES OF EDUCATION WE THINK THOSE TWO APPROACHES ARE PROBABLY WHAT MOST DISTRICTS WILL DO. ALTERNATIVELY THOUGH THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SPEND DOWN RESEARCH. AS FAR AS THE ESTIMATES OF THE I THINK THE GUY THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD IT WAS THE MOST POINT. OVER THE YEAR PERIOD. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES ARE VERY TO OUR IS IN TWO BOTH TERMS OF GENERAL REVENUE. ON THE PROPERTY TAX. OTHER ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE I JUST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ABOUT BARS OVER THE ENTIRE THREE YEAR BUDGET. SO VERY COSTARS. THANK YOU IN A SIGNIFICAN ECONOMIC ANSWER. THIS BASE RIGHT NOW WE ARE EXPECTING. TO SEE AT LEAST SOME CHANGES IN REVENUE- BY NAY. THOSE CHANGES BECAUSE TRUST FUND IS OPERATIVE WOULD ALSO AFFECT CARE AND- BUT SURPRISINGLY THOSE CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEED MIGHT NOT MEAN MORE OR LESS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS. THE EXTENT TO GUARANTEE IS HIGHER LIKELY THE STATE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A LARGER DEPOSIT INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVES. AND TO THE EXTENT THE GUARANTEE IS LOWER. THE STATE IS LIKELY GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SOME OF THAT DROPPED. BY MAKING A SMALLER DEPOSITS INTO THE PROPOSITION AND THE RESEARCH. ADMINISTRATION ONE ST SOME PAY. AND WE THAT'S WHERE. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MINIMUM CARE. AS ARE COVERED GROUND THAT IT HAD LOST LAST YEAR. AND BARRING ANOTHER RECESSION IT LOOKS LIKE GROWTH THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BE. ENOUGH TO NOT ONLY COVER THE COST OF AT BUT I SOME OTHER AGREED TO. ANOTHER CONSIDERATION WHICH IS PERHAPS AN EVEN BIGGER ISSUE FOR THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE IS WELL THAT THE STATE IS FACED A GROWING OPERATING DEFICIT ON THE NON. JUST NINETY EIGHT OF THE BUT- UNDER THE ADMIN. FOR THAT DEATH IS GROWS TO NEARLY A LOT BILLION BY. FOUR TWENTY FIVE. ABSENT CHANGES THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT THAT DOUBLES WOULD GO TO NEARLY SEVEN BUILD WALLS. SO THE SUPPLEMENT PAYMENT CHANGES. I DON'T DELIVER THAT DAY. BUT THEY DO MAKE A LITTLE BIT YOU TO DO LESS. A SHIFT THIS SPEND PROPOSED. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS A TOTAL OF NAY POINT ONE BILLION YEN NEW PROPER NINETY SPENDING. I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY COVER IN THE MID OF THE MOVING TO. OF THAT NINETEEN POINT ONE BILLION. POINT FIVE BILLION IS THE ONE TIME. IN TWO POINT SIX BILLION IS FOR ON OBJECTIONS WISELY. JUST ONCE. WHAT WHAT OTHER ISSUE THE ON YOUR IS PENSIONS. SCHOOLS AND CAN COLLEGE BOTH OF EXPERIENCE LARGE. IN PENSION OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. THE JUNE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED TO THREE. FOR ONE TIME. AT LEAST. SPREAD ROUGHLY. OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AT THE STATE ESSENTIALLY BY DOWN COST THE DISTRICTS WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PAID OUT OF THEIR LOCAL OPERATING BUDGETS THOSE TO YEARS. OKAY AHEAD TO TWENTY ONE TO TWO. DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO FACE AN INCREASE OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY AS MUCH AS HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. THE INCREASE IS PROJECTED TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE LIKELY SOMETHING CLOSER TO ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT'S LARGELY THE RESULT OF THAT ONE TIME FUNDING- EXPIRING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. ALSO TRYING TO RSS I THINK ONE KEY ASPECT OF THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT CONTAINS A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION. OF THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO A LITTLE OVER FIVE BILLION HISTORY ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT ONE TIME QUESTION I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF PROTECTION. AGAINST ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CUT. I'M GOING PROGRAMS IS TO GUARANTEE DROPS EITHER WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS OR POTENTIALLY WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR TO. ON THE ACT OF PROPOSED THE FOR POINTS TO BILLION. I WOULD SUGGEST A SMALLER MORE TRADED. APPROACH WILL BE COVERING THAT. WHAT WILL HAPPEN THE NEXT A PANEL OF THE LATE ON SO ST MICHAEL ON THE- WE ALSO WOULD SIX YOU CONSIDER IF YOU WERE A NEW AND- THIS BUDGET HAS AROUND TWO DOZEN. THE NEW PRICKLE ACROSS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMBINED. BUT WE DO THINK SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE. BUT OUR CONCERN IS THAT DOING ALL OF THOSE PROPOSALS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC MIGHT DILUTE THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT AND RISK SHIFTING ATTENTION AWAY FROM. OTHER RESTORATIONS COURT PROGRAMS. FINALLY WE RECOMMEND ALLOCATING MORE FUNDING FOR PAYING DOWN DEFERRALS IN ADDRESSING PENSION COSTS. CAN DOWN DEFERRALS WOULD HELP- THE STATE'S. GET THE PROPOSITION EIGHT BUDGET BACK IN BALANCE THAT WOULD REALIGN PROGRAMS WITH THE ON GOING FUNDING THAT IS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO THANK THE LEGISLATURE COULD USE ONE TIME FUNDING TO SMOOTH OUT THE LARGE INCREASE IN PENSION COSTS THAT ARE. PROJECTED FOR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE COULD SET ASIDE EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION NOW ON A ONE TIME BASIS. AND USE THAT TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE. GRADUAL RAMP UP ATTENTION COST OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. WE THINK THE STATE COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT. PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED. PENSION LIABILITIES WHICH WOULD REDUCE DISTRICT COST OVER A MUCH LONGER PERIOD. YES I CAN OUR COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET DANCE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HOWEVER OF QUESTIONS TO JUST DRAW OUT SOME OF THE SUBJECTS THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THE FIRST ONE WILL START WITH A FINANCE- YOU ALLUDED TO IT BUT A GIVEN THE ONE TIME RESOURCES AVAILABLE WHY DID DO NOT RECOMMEND FULLY PAYING OFF THE DIFFERENCE. RIGHT AND AGAIN AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- DOESN'T OF FAIR QUESTION CERTAINLY SO I THINK. I WOULD I WOULD. THANKS TO ME I KIND OF HAVE TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT TO KIND OF A HIGHER LEVEL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET PLANNING WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AND- BUT SIGNIFICANT YES THE INCREASE OF FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS. OR SEVENTEEN POINT TWO INCLUDING THE- THE SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENT ON TOP OF THE ENACTED TWENTY TWENTY ONE LEVELS BUT A HUGE PORTION OF THAT RIGHT HAS TO GO TOWARDS PAYING DOWN THE DEFERRALS AND SO DOES LIMIT IN SOME SENSE OF. HOW MUCH- IN NEW MONEY AS IT WERE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO BUDGET WITH BECAUSE WE JUST NEED TO GET. AT LEAST KIND OF BACK TO THE BASELINE RIGHT WITHOUT THOSE DEFERRALS AND SO THAT'S KIND OF HOW I THINK OF IT AS A SORT OF A STEP. ONE- AND THEN. MARRYING THAT OF. WITH THE GETTING GETTING BACK TO THE DAY. I MEAN. WITH ALSO TO MAX THE AMOUNT RESOURCES THAT WE CAN GET OUT TO ELEAZAR. IN REAL TIME NOW WHEN YOU SEE THAT THROUGH THE SIX POINT SIX BILLION IN THE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON OUR EARLY ACCESS PROPOSALS. TO REALLY TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE- LIKE YOU SAID THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCE DIGNITARIES NOW TO RESPOND WITH THE PANDEMIC TO BE ABLE TO- RE OPENED SAFELY WHEN APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO. BRIDGE THE GAP THAT MANY STUDENTS ARE FEELING AND LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE STATE- WHILE ALSO- AS ELIO POINTED OUT MANAGING THAT CUSHION AS WELL OF ONE TIME. VERSUS ONGOING SPENDING PROPOSALS AND SO- THAT IS WHY WE LANDED ON THE- ALSO HAVING THE DEFERRAL SO WE ARE FULLY RETIRING ELEVEN BILLION THAN CREATING A NEW TO. A NEW SMALLER TO FOR ALL OF THE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION WE FELT THAT THAT WAS. GIVEN THE CUSHION THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO SOME EXTENT BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING TO WHERE. I'VE REVENUES WERE TO DROP IS ONLY A MENTION OF BETWEEN- THE- DEEPER MANY RESERVE DEPOSITS AND OTHER PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE- IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN AN IMMEDIATE CUT. TO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT DECLINE- AND SO WE FELT THAT IT WAS MOST PRUDENT TO STRUCTURE IT IN THIS WAY. LIKE I SAID TO REALLY MAXIMIZE. IMMEDIATE RESOURCES- AND THEN ALSO GET- AT LEAST BACK TO A MORE SIX STABILIZE TRAJECTORY THAN THEY OTHERWISE. WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE- THE DEFERRAL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE THREE POINT SEVEN AND NOT. JUST AN ESTIMATE BY- OR INTENT IN THERE IS THAT THAT WOULD BE WHAT'S CALLED A JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL AT THE END OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR- AND TYPICALLY THOSE ARE- AND I DON'T THE I DON'T DOWN PLAY IT TOO MUCH I DON'T WORK AT DALY LEVELED- AS FAR AS I UNDER. IT BELIEVE MIKE FIVE WITH WILL DISCUSSES THE ON THAT TENDS TO. LESS IN. ON A CASH FLOW BASIS. GIVEN THAT IT'S A DEFERRAL OF JUST REALLY A MATTER. OF WEEKS- THAT AND WHEN WE HAVE THESE Mà. FEBRUARY TWO NOVEMBER X. BEING TO FOR. YOU KNOW CASH FOR MONTHS MONTHS- SO THAT'S THAT'S MY OF FOR. IT TO QUESTION. HOPEFUL I'M NOT GOING TO WITH FOR FREE AND NOW. OF THE LET ME ASK A FULL OF COURSE A YEAR CIRCUM. USUALLY ABOUT ANYTHING TO THE MEASURE BUT WATCHED SAY. FEDERAL FUNDS COME FOR HEALTHCARE AND YOU MAY TAKE TO BUILD DOLLAR DEAD YOU THINK WOULD GO TO TEST IT DISSED. BY FED STATE FUNDS IN SOME WAY ARE ON HEALTHCARE. BARR AND IT FREES UP ONE TIME MONIES WOULD THIS BE NEAR THE TOP OF YOUR LIST OF SOMETHING TO BUY OUT IN THE MAY REVISED TO JUST TRY TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE THEY DID HAVE EXPERIENCE AS A BUDGET CHAIR WERE. WHERE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO ONE TIME DEBTS THAT ENDED UP LASTING FOREVER AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S A PRIORITY. FOR WHEN YOU LOOK AT- THINGS IN MAY. YEAH WELL I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. QUESTIONS WITH WITH IN THAT BUT- BOTTOM LINE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT IF IT'S A PRIORITY I THINK AT THAT POINT IN THE YEAR- THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF STATE CASH FLOW AND WHAT HEALTH IS THERE- SO I THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST A QUESTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS COMING IN BUT ALSO WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE GENERAL FUND REVENUE AND THE AND THE GENERAL FUND. CASH FLOW PICTURE- AND AGAIN BY THE TIME ME COMES AROUND- THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE MORE MONTH OF APPORTIONMENT SITTING THERE AND SO- YOU REALLY JUST BE TALKING ABOUT YOU'D POTENTIALLY RESTRUCTURING THAT END OF THIS YEAR JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL- AND WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOME PAUSE BECAUSE ANOTHER THING THAT I DIDN'T ANSWER OR DIDN'T GET TO IN MY PREVIOUS ANSWER IS- WITH ELLIE MANY ELEAZAR APPLYING FOR A TRAN- DO YOU HAVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DURING THIS TIME ALONE- IF. WE WERE TO CHANGE THE SCHEDULE UP ON THEM- IN THE MEANTIME MANY OF THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE APPLYING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AT ONCE- ALREADY RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING APPROVED HERE IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY HERE IN IN THE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF FEBRUARY AND SO- BUT TO CHANGE UP HOW THAT STRUCTURE WOULD WORK AND- DID NOT END UP DEFERRING SOME OF THOSE MONIES WOULD. RESULT IN POTENTIALLY- FEDERAL PENALTIES THERE'S BASED ON THE TAX STATUS OF THOSE LOANS AND SO WE'RE A LITTLE HESITANT TO GO TOO FAR DOWN THAT ROAD- BUT I THINK- THAT'S FOR THE CURRENT YEAR DEFERRALS I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THAT THE DEFERRAL CERTAINLY IF A SITUATION AROSE WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO- SHORTEN THAT DEFERRAL- YEAH. REDUCE THE SIZE THAT TO FOR ALL I THINK WE WOULD BE OPEN TO PRIORITIZING THAT AS LONG AS WE CAN STILL LIKE I SAID MAXIMIZE ALL THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING. TO MAXIMIZE. I APPRECIATE ANSWER JUST IN IN THE IN THE- OUT IN THE YEAR OF THE FOR BUDGET THAT'S- IF MAKE TOTAL TO NOT RUN UP THE DAY. BECAUSE ANY TIME. A DISTRICT THE BALL OR DO A TRAIN ONE OF THE THINGS PICKING THE IN IN MANY Y. FOR WHAT THE STATE IS DOING IN TERMS OF THE DEFERRAL SO THE SOONER THAT WE CAN BUY IT OUT IN THE NEXT YEAR. OF THE BETTER IT IS I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND MAYBE I'LL START WITH THELA- EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD FIT WITH BOTH OF YOU. AND THAT IS A SINCE I WAS LAST IN THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSITION TWO PASSED AND IT WAS MENTIONED IN YOUR PRESENTATIONS THAT THE- THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT- IS HERE. AND MONEY IS BEING SWEPT INTO IT- IN THIS BUDGET MAYBE IF YOU COULD TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THAT US FAR. WHAT IF THE CURRENT TRENDS WITH WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET CONTINUE HOW MUCH WILL BE IN THERE AND- I THINK THAT. NOBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN THIS SOON AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING AND IT'S ID AND. IF YOU JUST REMIND OUR LISTENERS. WHAT THE CITY. IS TO ALLOW YOU TO GO INTO THE RESERVE AT ANY TIME SO IT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE RESERVE BEFORE THIS YEAR. OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S THIS LIKE AN- HOUR WHAT WOULD IT TAKE IS JUST THE START OF A TREND IN FUTURE YEARS THAT A LOT MORE WILL GO IN OF REVENUES CONTINUE IT AT THIS WAY. I JUST WAS LOOKING FOR A BRIEF OVERVIEW SO THAT. WE CAN BRING EVERYBODY ALONG ON THIS. YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE WAS ADDED BY OPPOSITION TO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THE THEORY BEHIND THIS. PROPOSITION NINETY RESERVE AS WELL AS THE STATE'S- BROADER RESERVE THE BUDGET STATE. ACCOUNT IS THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE UNEXPECTED. SURGES IN ONE TIME REVENUE. AND SO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THESE RESERVE DEPOSIT SEEM LIKE THEY ALWAYS SNEAK UP ON US IS THAT. THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE RESERVE DEPOSIT IS DESIGNED TO PICK UP ITS ONE REVENUE INCREASES IN A WAY THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY ANTICIPATE IN A BASELINE FORECAST. THE FORMULAS REQUIRED US TO SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING INDUSTRIES- EVENT IN THIS CASE THE UNEXPECTED FACTORS THE- STRONGER CAPITAL GAINS MUCH STRONGER STOCK MARKET THAN. ANY OF US ANTICIPATED. LAST SUMMER. THE PROPOSITION TO WHAT THIS SPECIAL PROVISION THAT SAID NO TO PA. INTO THERE WAS COULD IN TWO HERE AND- ADD- HE WAS GONNA COME FOR BUT AS THAT YOU'RE HAD SURPASS. THREE GREATEST LEVELS ADJUSTED INFLATION AND IT TOOK A NUMBER OF SAID THAT TO HAPPEN SO THEY WERE. UP FOR OR FIVE YEARS THE NAY PASSED WITH DEPOSITS WERE. BUT AHEAD TO- FROM THIS POINT I THINK I JUST DEVICE VERY LIKE ARE POSSIBLE THE ADMINISTRATION- THEIR MULTI YEAR- OUTLOOK AS THE PROPOSITION BALANCE NOT PROPOSITION NINETY A GOOD. A GROWING TO THREE BILL BY THE END OF ONE TO TWO THEN STAY ROUGHLY AT THREE BILLION OF THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BUT AGAIN IN A- GIVEN THE KIND OF FACTORS THAT FEED INTO THAT CALCULATION IT COULD EASILY BE MUCH LARGER MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. I THINK HE- RIGHTS OF THE FORMULA LOOK AT. A GENERALLY THE PROGRESS THE PA ARE. WHEN THE PROPER NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. IS GOING FAST THAN PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME AND WHEN THE STATE RECEIVES. A LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL GAINS REVENUE IN EXCESS OF THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE ONE OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS FROM AND A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT. JUST ONE B. OPERATIVES AND SO YOU FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT- JUST ONE IS OPERATIVE- ALL THREE YEAR OF THE BUDGET PERIOD. VERY LIKELY TO BE OFF OF THE NAY COUPLE OF. AND SO EVEN THOUGH THE STATE HAS MADE- RESERVE DEPOSITS IN THE- THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A DANNY THAT WILL BE TO ABOUT- FOR YEARS AND IT'S- AS WELL. I AM WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO. CREATE TO RELEASE. MONEY FROM THE- BACK AND THE STATE BUDGET WHAT'S THAT PROCESS. THAT IS GOING BY CON. FORMULAS AND THAT'S REQUIRED. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE ISN'T GROWING FAST ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE PRIOR YEAR'S FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR. INFLATION FACTOR IN CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE. SO IF FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WAS A VERY OR YEAR OR EVEN A- OR A MEDIOCRE YEAR IN TERMS OF STATE REVENUE IT'S LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE TO WITHDRAW SOME OR POTENTIALLY ALL OF THAT THREE BILLION. IN ALLOCATE THAT OUT TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND A TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE LEGISLATURE YOU CAN DECIDE WHICH PROGRAMS IN WHICH AREA IS AND HOW THE RESERVE DEPOSIT IS DISTRIBUTED BACK ON BUT IT'S BEEN. IT'S BASICALLY LIKE PARA THE RAINY DAY RESERVE ITSELF IT IS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE MONEY IN GOOD TIMES AND BE ABLE TO SPEND IT IN BAD TIMES TO TRY TO EVEN OUT THE- THE TROUGHS. IN THE BUDGET THAT'S THE DESIGN. THAT'S THE BASIC DESIGN OF. THE- THE PROPOSITION AND EIGHT RESERVE A LITTLE BIT RESTRICT IN TERMS OF WHEN DEPOSITS GO IN SO WE DON'T MAKE DEPOSITS INTO THAT ACCOUNT AS OFTEN AS WE DO FOR THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. AND ALSO AS MORE. FORCEFUL IN TERMS OF WHEN THE POP MONEY HAS TO BE TAKEN OUT WHICH THE STATE OF LOOK AT MY DISCRETION ABOUT WHEN IT TAKES MONEY OUT OF THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. BUT IN. IN CERTAIN CASES IT HAS TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE PROPOSITIONING TO SERVICE. BUT THAT THE J. IDEA IS SAME. OKAY THANK VERY MUCH OUR PER THAT AND US SENATOR MEANT TO QUESTIONS OF PANEL. YES SO I JUST WANTED TO I GUESS RE ENTER. CHAIRMAN LATER ITS POINT OF- WE I TAKE TO BE THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE FLOW INCLUDING ABOUT HOW TO SPEND DOLLARS WERE OBVIOUSLY FACING. A LOT OF UNIQUE CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW A. N. POTENTIALLY A LOT OF ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS- AND I GUESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I'VE HAD IN AND I KNOW THAT THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE IS NOT DATA BUT- IN TALKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ONLY AS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MY DISTRICT. IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE IN POINT HAS HAS BEEN REFLECTED PARTICULARLY IN NEED TO EARLY ACTION ITEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S REQUESTED- AND I THINK THAT THE L. A. O. HAS COMMENTED AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER THAT THE- EXPANDED LEARNING AND LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION. PROPOSAL MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER LARGE IN AN APT- AND OF COURSE THERE THERE ARE SOME. ISSUES THAT BY SMILEY AS HAVE WITH THE RE OPENING PROPOSAL IS SO I GUESS I THIS IS MORE A COMMENT A QUESTION AS THEY SAY BUT- I THINK COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS CRITICAL. MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOLS AND THEIR NEEDS ARE DRIVING OUR BUDGET ALLOCATIONS PARTICULARLY AS WERE FACING POTENTIALLY A LOT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS COMING IN- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO I GUESS I JUST EMPHASIZE- THAT THAT HAS BEEN A COMPLAINT FROM MY DISTRICT. ARE FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I'VE TALKED TO- AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION FOLLOWING UP ON YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE PENSION GAP THAT THAT SEEMS TO BE A POTENTIALLY CHRONIC PROBLEM. WHAT ARE WE DOING AND WHAT CAN WE DO POTENTIALLY TO INCENTIVIZE ELEAZAR TO MORE FULLY FUND THEIR. PENSION LIABILITIES. THANK TAKE THE FOR. INCIDENT MAYBE THE PROGRESS IT'S GETTING ON BY- DESTROY. ADD TO. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL HAVE SOME. ABILITY TO- SAY FOR INCREASES IN PENSION COSTS THE COST. DOWN LISTINGS TRUST ACCOUNTS. THE TO SET ASIDE IN ONE YEAR A COST INCREASE IN A FEW. BY THEY ALL REQUIRE TO PAY IN THE CONTRIBUTION THAT'S- UP AT THE STATE LEVEL- THE STATE HAS A FUNDING PLAN FOR CAL STIRS THAT THE TERM. THE COUNTRY MADE TODAY TEACHERS ARE TIME SYSTEM AND THEN THE GUY BOARD OF. HEALTH THAT'S RATE FOR A DISTRICT CLASSIFY EMPLOYEES. SO DISTRICTS DON'T GET TO CONTROL THE RATE. AND SO THAT'S ONE REASON AT. THE BIGGEST OF PENSION AS MUCH OR A- STATE BUDGETING ISSUE- AND ONE OF THE REASONS WE THAT'S ASIDE SOME MORE FOR THOSE PENSIONS. TODAY REALLY HELP MANAGE THOSE GREAT AND- THAT THEY'RE FACING A YEAR WILL JUST WILL HAVE TO WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER THE RATES ARE I DON'T HAVE TO THOSE. BUT SUCH ASIDE SO MONEY TO WOULD ALLOW THOSE GREAT TO GROW BIT MORE STE OVER THE COUPLE OF. MAKE IT EASY FOR JUST A TO BOUNCE THE BUDGET WELL AS THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS. THAT GREAT THANK YOU MUCH. WE REALLY HAVE. THE BOTH OF YOU BEING WITH TODAY WAS WERE HELPFUL AND WE KNOW THIS IS. THIS OF A LONG SLOW. AND WE'LL BE SEEING YOU MANY. TO GO SO. THANKS FOR HERE TO. OR WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO A THREE WHICH TO LOCK CAN FOR FORMULA AND ARE PAN. OR AGREE FROM THE- OF FINE. MICHAEL R. FERRIS FROM THE ALITO'S OFFICE AND ALLEY GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND DON'T WANT WE START WITH THE- I ASSUME THAT SELENA RIGHT UP THERE NOW SO WHEN IT WE START WITH WIN. YES GOOD MORNING WE KNOW GRANT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF TODAY I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FUNDS THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR. SO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT AS YOU MAY RECALL AND WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED- DID NOT PROVIDE A STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE LCS BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN AVAILABLE REVENUES. PANDEMIC IN RECOGNITION OF THE SUSPENDED CALL UP. AND IN AN EFFORT TO RETURN LCF AFTER THE TRAJECTORY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON. THE CALL AND NOT BEEN SUSPENDED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDS THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO I'LL SEE IF THAT'S- WHAT THE CALL OF ONE POINT 5% BUT IT IS IF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. TWO POINT. CREATES. A COME. COLADA OF THREE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. THE JUST TO BE CLEAR- THE BUDGET DOES NOT RESTORE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALL UP THAT BUILDS TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO LCS. AS IF I TWO POINT 31% COLA HAD BEEN PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR. IS COMPOUNDED COLA IS ALSO PROVIDED TO TARGET COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND IT INCREASES THE TOTAL- QALAT INCREASES ONGOING L. CFM OF FUNDING BY ALMOST TWO BILLION- PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. THE TOTAL DISTRICT LCF FUNDING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS PROJECTED TO BE SIXTY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION AND THAT FUNDS ALL I LIAISE AND THEIR FULL LC AFFECT FORGET LEVEL. THAT'S JUST A HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY AND I CAN PROVIDE MORE DETAILS UPON REQUEST OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- I CAN REITERATE ANYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT COLABORA PROVIDING TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT THAT'S THAT. THAT'S JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT AND- I THINK WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS AND WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER WE GET THROUGH OF ALL THREE. ON NEXT IS A MICHAEL AFFAIRS FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MICHAEL FERRIS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE YOU JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS REGARDING THOSE COLLATERAL CFF WE THINK THAT FINANCES ESTIMATE- THE ONE POINT 5% COLOR FOR THE BUDGET YEAR TO REASONABLE THE STATE WILL HAVE THE FINAL NUMBER IN APRIL BUT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ISSUES. WITH THE ESTIMATE AND THE JANUARY BUDGET. ON PER THE ADDITION TWO POINT THE WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE KERR YEAR. YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THE- LOST. MORE ONGOING FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WOULD BE MORE MONEY INTO OCF IS A GOOD WAY TO DO THAT HAS IT. ALL DISTRICT PROVIDES DISTRICTS FIXABLE. TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR DISADVANTAGED. ON I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU MUCH. AND THEN WILL GO TO SALLY GARNERED- OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WELCOME GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU L. A. R. AND BEHALF OF THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. WELL WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE A THREE POINT EIGHT FOUR CALL AN LCS FAST WE WOULD ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE COULD. NOT CONSIDER PROVIDING THE SAME LEVEL OF COLOR TO THE PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF LCS. I THE S. S. B. I. HAS NO CREEK. THERE WOULD BE THAT TERM INCREASE IN. FIRST TO SAVE OPEN. AND THE PROGRAMS. OF LCS WITHIN A FROM THIS ADDITIONAL. AS WELL. IN ADDITION WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT HE TRAILER BILL AND WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION ONCE THAT IS RELEASED. THOSE ARE REMARKABLY BRIEF PRESENTATIONS. SO LET ME FOLLOW UP WITH- A- AWAY FROM THE STATE'S SCHOOLS CHIEF'S OFFICE. ARE YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT FUNDING OUTSIDE AT THE SAME LEVEL. OF FROM. HOME TO DRAW YOU OUT A LITTLE MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AT WHAT LEVEL OVER WHAT THE GOVERNOR MIGHT HAVE PROPOSED TO HER. WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF WHAT YOU SAID. CERTAINLY SO I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SUPER COLA AS AS IT'S BEING CALLED. AND THESE ARE AREAS IN THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED THAT SUPER CALISTA WE WOULD NOTE THAT SPACE- IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED BUT WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR THINGS LIKE NUTRITION THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM- ON AN OTHERWISE WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE LCF TRADITIONAL FUNDING MECHANISMS. OKAY AND LET ME S. FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT NOW THAT YOU'VE HEARD. THAT PRESENTATION AND THE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION. RIGHT I GOT INTO CONSIDERATION I DON'T KNOW ERIN GEN. HI I APOLOGIZE THERE'S A MAYBE A BIT OF A LAG. GENERATED APART ARMENIANS HOPEFULLY EVERYONE. OKAY I THINK EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME NOW- I WOULD JUST- NOTES IT CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE WE'RE AWARE OF WE RECOGNIZE- YOU KNOW ALL OF THAT THE FUNDING OUR PRIORITIES AND THINGS THAT- ELLIE WHAT THE DEPARTMENT MANAGED MENTIONED- BUT I LOOK AT IT AGAIN AS A WITHIN THE BROADER SCHEME OF THE OF THE BUDGET PACKAGE TO PROVIDE TO THE ADDITIONAL COLA TO. PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE LCF OUT MEANS LESS FUNDING FOR OTHER PROPOSALS PRIORITIES- THAT ARE ALSO OUTSIDE THE LCF POTENTIALLY SO IT'S JUST A CONVERSATION UP WITH IN. IN A FINITE OF RESEARCH WHERE WE PRIORITIZE THINGS SO THAT WAS THE ONES WERE WE WILL AT WHEN WE DECIDED TO- ONLY PROVIDE THE COMPOUND COLLEGE THE LCI AFTER- SO THAT WE COULD- PUT FORTH ALL PROPOSED THAT YOU IN SIGNATURE AMOUNTS- AND THE OF SOMETHING LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILLION OUR ESPECIALLY. OR INTERVENTION GRANTS CONTINUATION IT'S SEVERAL THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE A SMALLER AND PERHAPS LESS SIGNIFICANT IF WE MADE THE CHOICE TO PROVIDE A COMPOUNDED CALL OUT TO ALL THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS SO NOT THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT CERTAINLY BUT JUST AGAIN PART OF THE KIND OF BROADER- BUDGET. CONSIDERATION AND WE HAVE TO MAKE ONE WHEN PUTTING FORTH THAT MUCH KIND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THE LEVEL OF REVENUES IS SUSTAINED WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE ESTIMATE AND YOU MIGHT GET SOME DISPLACEMENT FOR. TESTING COSTS OR MEDICAL COSTS THAT ARE IN YOUR PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT FREE UP MONEY OF FOR THIS AS AS IT NATURALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEND A THREE DIFFERENT WAYS SO YOU KNOW WE LOVE TO DIFFERENCE TO BE PAID OFF WE WOULD LOVE FOR THE COLD TO BE OUTSIDE BUT ARM THAT WOULD GIVE YOU FLEXIBILITY OF SOME OF THOSE INSTANCES. CAME TO PASS RIGHT. THIS THIRD. I THINK IT'S YEAH IF PROBABLY WAS LARGE AND WE HAVE MORE READ. WERE BE OF IT AND OF THAT FUNDS BECAUSE I. A INFLUX OF. EACH FIND AYE AYE THINK CERTAIN THAT THE CERTAINLY MAKE OUR JOB A- WE- COME TOO MUCH WHEN WE HAVE. MORE MONEY THAN WE KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH SO YEAH THINK. THAT THAT'S A REASON TO- APPROACH TO HAVE- I DON'T KNOW I'VE HEARD. COMPLAIN THEY SAID MONEY. SOME PROBLEM I SUPPOSE YEAH. MMHM AND HE ONE THING AND DON'T KNOW BEST DO THIS MAY I JUST WITH THE- A. O. THEN GO- EITHER WAY. BOMB ARE. EVERYTHING'S MOVING TO WILL WE HAVE THIS TO. RIGHT NOW TALKING WHAT TO DO IS MY BE BUT NOW AND MAY. BY JUST. WATCH RECOMMENDED- YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT COLE WAS MIGHT START TO LOOK LIKE IN THE OUT YEARS SO I MEAN R. D. WHEN YOU START THAT DISCUSSION- WITH SCHOOLS. WHO WHAT COULD YOU TELL THEM BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW NOW. SO I DON'T KNOW BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS OR I'M HAPPY TO TAKE IT AS WELL- MAYBE IF I COULD HAVE MY COLLEAGUES CAN. BEGUN THIS. YEAH THANK YOU CHAIR CABANA DALLAS AUSTIN SO. PROJECT IN A COLA HAS- BEEN A LITTLE BUT A EXERCISE IT'S- COMES TO US. FROM A FEDERAL AND THAT'S DESIGNED TO REFLECT REFLECT THE COST OF. ATTENDANCE PURCHASED BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT'S THE NOW IS A GREAT MEASURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA- ARTICLE ESTIMATES COME FROM- THE CONSENSUS FORECAST THAT'S PREPARED BY MOODY'S ANALYTICS. AND THEY HAVE THE COLA HOVERING AT AROUND ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS SO THAT IS A BIT LOWER THAN WHAT DISTRICTS ARE USED TO THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN AROUND TWO AND A HALF PERCENT OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. OR SO- SO THEY IS A I THINK IT CAN. FOR YOU AT THAT THERE MIGHT. AN FOR DE. TO MY THESE RELATIVE STILL. OR MODEST. COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THE NEXT YEARS JUST KIND OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CUT A OF ME AS COVERED A BIT. FROM WHERE IT WAS IN JUNE BUT WE'RE PROJECT BUT- AT A LOT OF. ARE SLOWER IN COUPLE OF. REFINED I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HIGHER ASK COVERING CLOSER TO PER. OVER THE COUPLE YEARS- I'D IT'S A TO- INDEX TO BRIDGE THE GAP- SO THAT BUT I THINK THAT WE AND A HALF TO. PERCENT THAT'S KIND GOOD PLANNING RANGE FOR A DISTRICTS AND STATE TO OF THE COUPLE. I YOU I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR AND I KNOW. WHEN L. A. O. SAYS QUOTE IT WOULD BE A DE ACTORS AND SOME MORE IN SOME WAYS TO. LA SPEAK FOR TO CRACK. AND WILL JUST SEE WHAT WITH THESE FOR GOING UP IN DOWN MY SENATE MEN DO YOU HAVE ANY. NO HE GOOD SO WHAT BUT ME JUST THANK OF YOU- REALLY APPRECIATE- ARE YOU. HERE A I KNOW THE- THAT SOME OF YOUR- BECAUSE- IT SEEMS LIKE SAID EXPO. BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT. SO GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER.

AND WE HAVE AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO. NOW LET'S GO IN THAT ORDER MELISSA ELLIE AMYMORE SIFANG WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M LISTENING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF SINCE I JOINED HAS ALREADY DONE- NUMBER GOOD JOB IN LAYING- THE AMOUNT OF TIME FUNDS WE RECEIVE SO FAR AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUNDING. BEEN SO FAR- SO JUST TO GO QUICKLY OVER THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FUNDING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ALLOCATED SIX POINT FOUR BILLION. AND ONE TIME FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS AID RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT OR CARES ACT OF FUNDING FOR K. TWELVE EDUCATION THIS INCLUDED FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION FROM THE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND- R. C. R. F. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY EDUCATION RELIEF FUND. WORK YEAR AND ONE POINT SIX BILLION FROM THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND OR ESR. THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN CRF ALONG WITH THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE POINT TWO MILLION FROM TWO YEAR AND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION PROVIDED FROM PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUND PROVIDED TOGETHER AT TOTAL OF FIVE POINT THREE BILLION. FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION. THIS FUNDING WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS VARIOUS IN. AND TO CALL THE NINE- INCLUDE- FOUR PP. I'M HEALTH AND SAFETY ACT ACTIVITIES EXPANDING LEARNING SUPPORTS INCREASING INSTRUCTIONAL TIMEFOR DEVICES AND CONNECTIVITY- INTEGRATED STUDENT SUPPORTS AND ADDRESSING OTHER BARRIERS INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS PROVIDED FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION ONE POINT SIX BILLION WAS PROVIDED FROM ANSWER WHICH ALSO ALLOW FOR A BROAD RANGE OF BOTH OF USES FROM ADDRESSING LEARNING LOSS TO PREPARING SCHOOLS FOR RE OPENING. 90% OR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WAS ALLOCATED AT LEAST BASED ON THEIR PROPORTION OF CHILD ONE PART EIGHT ALLOCATIONS WHAT THE REMAINING AN INCREASE IN THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR SCHOOL MEALS. A GRANT PROGRAM FOR IMPLEMENTING THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL AND FRIEND MINISTRY AND COST FOR ALLOCATING IN OVERSEEING THE CURES ACT FUNDING- MOVING ON TO TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE MOST RECENT CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE AND RELIEF SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT OR CHRIS US. SIGNED INTO LAW LATE DECEMBER PROVIDED SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR SECOND ROUND OF THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL RELIEF FUND WHICH WE CALL AS OUR TWO. BEST FUNDING HAS SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS AS S. R. ONE IN THAT 90% OF THIS FUNDING OR SIX BILLION BE ALLOCATED TO ELEAZAR BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF TITLE ONE PAR AID ALLOCATIONS. THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE DISCRETION HOW THIS FUNDING IS ALLOCATED OR THE USE OF THESE FUNDS CENSUS. AND SPECIFIED IN FEDERAL LAW. SO DO TO TIE THE GOVERNOR'S MUCH DID NOT THE PER. FOR THE FUNDING FROM THE SECOND- FOR BELIEF PACKAGE HOWEVER WE DID SUBMIT A SECTION TWENTY EIGHT LETTER TO ALLOCATE THE SIX BILLION AND ONE TIME ANSWER TO FUNDS TO SUPPORT IMMEDIATE NEEDS. OF SCHOOLS NO OF THE REMAINING. FLEXIBLE FUNDS FROM ANSWER TO THE 10% OR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE PROPOSALS FOR BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON A PLAN FOR THE FOR THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. ADDITIONALLY THREE HUNDRED FORTY ONE MILLION IS AVAILABLE FROM THE SECOND ROUND OF GOVERNORS- REGENCY EDUCATION FUND OR HERE TO. OF WHICH A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN MILLION IS FLEXIBLE WELL ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION IS TO SUPPORT THE EMERGENCY AID FOR NON PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AGAIN FOR THE FLEXIBLE FUNDS WE INTEND TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON A PLAN. FOR THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND THE LAST POINT I WANTED TO MENTION IS THE SPENDING DEADLINE FOR THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN SIERRA PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE PROPOSING AS PART OF THE IMMEDIATE ACTION PACKAGE- TRAILER BILL TO EXTEND THE SPENDING DEADLINE FROM DECEMBER. THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TO MAY THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE FEDERAL DEADLINE WAS EXTENDED UNTIL. DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE- HELLO WE PROPOSED AT LEAST. AY UNSPENT FUNDS JUNE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW FOR BOTH- TIME TO RECOUP AND REALLOCATE FUNDS IF ANY- WE'RE HOPEFUL THE L. A.'S WILL FULLY EXPAND THEIR ALLOCATION PRIOR TO THIS NEW DEADLINE. HOWEVER WE INCLUDE THIS LANGUAGE AS A CONTINGENCY AND TO ENSURE THAT WE MAXIMIZE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE LIMIT. RETURNING UNSPENT FUNDS FEDERAL- AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL HAVE QUESTIONS I'M SURE BUT WE WILL DO IT AFTER- WE HEAR FROM THE OTHER TWO PANELISTS. OUR NEXT IS L. A. GARDNER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A OF. IS COVERED BY SOURCES AVAILABLE AND TO KEEP MY REMARKS BRIEF. JUST GONNA DIVE RIGHT INTO WHAT CDP HAS SEEN IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES AND USES OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS. THE CDC COMPLETED THE THIRD QUARTERLY REPORTING CYCLE IN JANUARY FOR THESE FUNDS WHICH CAPTURED EXPENDITURES FROM MARCH FIRST DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. THAT DATA REFLECTED 99% OF THE C. R. FUNDS WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT 83% OF AVAILABLE ALOT EL AL AND FUNDING. AND SO 99% OF THE C. R. FUNDS ARE EITHER EXPENDED ARE OBLIGATED TO THIS POINT. FURTHERMORE THE DATA REFLECTED THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE C. R. FUNDS ABOUT 59% WERE USED FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE. TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS INCREASING BROADBAND CAPACITY. SOFTWARE PURCHASES THAT ENABLE DISTANCE LEARNING HARDWARE PURCHASES FOR STUDENTS AND OUR TEACHERS SUCH AS LAPTOPS AND TABLETS. INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS FOR NECESSARY DISTANCE LEARNING. AND STAFF TRAINING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT NECESSARY. TO PROVIDE QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING. FOR THE REMAINING FIVE WERE TRYING THE GEAR ASSUR IN GENERAL. AT SOURCES. THERE'S A LARGE OF MONEY AND XP FUNDS. RANGING FROM A LOW OF 72% THE GENERAL REMAINING TO HOW OF EIGHTY NINE FOR OF THE STILL ROOM. HOW I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH CITIES EXPECTATIONS FOR USES OF FUNDS. ALLEYS WERE VERY STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SPEND THEIR C. R. FUND ALLOCATIONS FIRST GIVEN THAT THE ORIGINAL DEADLINE FOR USING THESE FUNDS WAS DECEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. WELL GENERAL FUND HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE OF THIS YEAR JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR AND AS A FUNDS DON'T EXPIRE. UNTIL SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE IN. OF CALL DATA THE FIRST. REQUIRED ANNUAL REPORT FOR ASSET YES SIR AND YOUR EXPENDITURES THOSE COVER THE MARCH THIRTEENTH STREET TWENTY TWENTY THREE SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TIME LINES. IT'LL IT ALIGNS WITH THE FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR. AND WE WILL HAVE MORE DATA SHARE ON THOSE FUNDS ONCE THAT REPORTING CYCLE HASBEEN COMPLETED. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THEN EMILY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WELCOME IN MORNING SENATORS AMY LEE FROM THE L. A. L. SO I WILL JUST FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE SECOND FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH. THIS PACKAGE PROVIDES A TOTAL OF EIGHTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. RECEIVE ABOUT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR ITS PUBLIC KEY TWELVE SCHOOLS. MOST OF THE SPENDING SIX BILLION WILL BE PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS AFTER TWO FUNDS WHICH WE HAD PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. DISTRICTS CAN USE THESE FUNDS ON A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT SCHOOL OPERATIONS. AND WILL JUST NOTED THAT THESE ALLOWABLE USES OVERLAP WITH THOSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TWO BILLION FOR SCHOOL WE OPENING AND- FOUR POINT SIX BILLION FOR EXTENDED LEARNING. THEIR MEANING EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION CAN USE ON STATE RIGHT PRIORITIES IN RESPONSE TO COPE AT NINETEEN. OF THIS. SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION COMES FROM ASTOR AND THE REMAINING ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR MILLION COMES FROM GEAR. TO GEAR MONEY CAN BE USED ON EITHER K. TWELVE OR HIGHER EDUCATION. THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARERS ACT AND THE SECOND TIME A FEDERAL RELIEF PACKAGE IS THAT THE SECOND PACKAGE ALSO PROVIDES. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EMERGENCY RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA'S PRIVATE SCHOOLS. CITY HAS SIX MONTHS TO WORK THESE FUNDS ELIGIBLE PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND ANY FUNDS REMAINING AFTER THIS TIME. CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR STATE RIGHT PRIORITIES AS CARE FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO THESE FEDERAL FUNDS THE BINDING AND MANY. HAS SEEN INTEREST IN PROVIDING. FUNDING TO SCHOOLS THE PLAN WOULD PROVIDE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. WHICH AN ESTIMATED THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT FOR IT SEE SCHOOL RE OPENING DISTANCE LEARNING AND LEARNING RECOVERY. I'M HAPPY TO. CONCLUDE MAY BE MORE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH. I HAVE A CUP OF. IN THE FIRST ONE IS- OF FURTHER REPRESENTATIVE FIND. ARE YOU MENTION THAT ON FLEX FUN THAT COME FROM. OF FEDERAL STEM. THAT YOU WORK THE LARGER. ON AIDS I THINK THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION IS WHAT YOU REFERENCED. AND WORK ON A PROPOSAL WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHAT YOUR TIME FRAME ON THAT WHEN ARE YOU EXPECTING TO DO THAT. LISTING WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH THE SPRING YOU KNOW AS- DEPARTMENT HAD MENTIONED THESE. THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO AWARD WITHIN- WITHIN ONE YEAR SO WE HAVE UNTIL DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO. I'M KIND OF PROGRAM THESE FUNDS AND WILL HAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO SPEND A FUNDING. SO I THINK WE HAVE YOU KNOW TIME IN THE SPRING TO KIND OF WORK THROUGH. THE PRIORITIES BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE. AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE URGENCY OF THE PANDEMIC MIGHT REQUIRE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SOONER. CANCELLABLE FUNDING WE'VE- ALLOCATED. THE BILL- ITS ACTION TO EIGHT WE ALL HAVE OUR PROPOSAL FOR THE BILL. AS WELL SO POINTS BILLION- YOU KNOW THESE REMAIN FINE. UP WE DO FORWARD TO. NOTE TRYING TO- TARGET THOSE FOR IT. SINCE WE'VE WE ARE. THESE LAW- HOT FUNDING FOR- A LOT OF THE REST. THE COMPANY PANDEMIC IN ALLOWABLE. FROM NO SCHOOL RE OPENING TO YOU KNOW. IN A- WITH THAT YOU KNOW THIS. REMAINING FUNDS WE COULD COULD YOU FOR MORE. FOR BUT BUT IT IS THERE FOR TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S DEAL TO BE MADE ABOUT REAL AND EDIT MY FIT SOME WAY. IS THAT STILL WHAT THAT STORE. HAVE RECOMMEND. TO IF THAT WERE THE- YES WE WILL BUILD TO ARKANSAS. THIS AS PART OF THE PACKAGE IS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN AND THEN MY QUESTION IS FOR THE LARGEST AND- ARE YOU SAID IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT THERE WAS AN OVERLAP OR WITH THE STIMULUS MONEY AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PROPOSED. DID YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR DIRECTIONS TO LOOK AT THAT OVERLAP AND SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING YOU THOUGHT WE SHOULD DO DIFFERENTLY AND HOW THOSE PROGRAMS ARE IMPLEMENTED. I MEAN WE WITHOUT A. AGAIN SO DON'T HAVE ANY. RECOMMENDATION FOR HOW FAST YOU CAN LEVERAGE THEIR SIX DOLLAR WILL BE. THEIR US TO I THINK OUR WE WOULD ONLY LET. TO CONSIDER HOW THESE FUN HE BE USED IN CONCERT WITH A PROPOSED ON THAT. REALLY TO USE RE OPENING ACT ANNEX EARNING. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A CENTER MINUTES HE HAS AN QUESTIONS OF PANEL YEAH I HAVE A FEW. I GUESS I APOLOGIZE FOR. IS THE L. A. AND PARTNER A FINANCE. I DIDN'T SEE- ANY DISCUSS- HEARING TO. OF IS PER. IN A CO- STIMULUS PACKAGE BEING NEGOTIATED NOW BETWEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN AND CON. ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDS THERE THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED MIGHT ALSO IMPACT- THIS BUDGET DISCUSSION. YES SENATOR I DO I CAN THAT IN WITHOUT OKAY. I'M SO AS AS FOR AS WE'RE- THAT DAY PUT OUT THE ANIMATION TO PADDOCK PLANNED TO. JUST FUNDING TO. ON IT WOULD A HUNDRED AND BILLION ACROSS. THE NATION AND AN ESTIMATE THIRTEEN BILLION WOULD GO TO CAL. TO SUPPORT CAL SCHOOL. UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS LIKE AT THAT AT THE FOR A LEVEL DISCUSSIONS ARE STILL. AND IN TERMS OF THE FOR AMOUNT WILL BE FOR- CAL. AND WHATEVER TRY TO RELIEF LOOKS LIKE I THINK IT'S A BIT TO EARLY TO. RIGHT NOW IF IT ASSUME WE GOT SAY LIKE ONE TEN OF THAT- THIRTEEN BILLION. HOW WOULD THAT IN. THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET- DISCUSS IN A AND WHAT MIGHT BE SORT OF. CHANGE. IF ANYTHING. AND MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE PART OF FINANCE LIKE ANYBODY WE THIRTEEN WE'RE NOT THAT WERE FLEX IN USE WITH THAT CHAIN ANY OF PARTICULAR- PRIORITIES THAT YOU HAVE IN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. YES WHAT IF I SO CERTAIN OF WE RECEIVE THE FOR- BE CONSENT WE WOULD CONSIDER. YOU KNOW AS WE OUR THE OWN YOU KNOW THE TWO ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. I THINK AT THIS TIME IT'S A LITTLE. FOR US TO MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS AND- YOU KNOW THAT HASN'T PASSED AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF STRINGS MAY BE ATTACHED TO HOW MUCH DISCRETION THE STATE WILL HAVE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WILL BE. ALLOW FOR FLEXIBLE USE AND YOU KNOW THAT. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO HAVE NO RESPONSE BE MORE TARGETED SINCE THEY'VE ALREADY PROVIDED. OF FUNDS TO ANSWER TO AND YOU KNOW DEAR TO AS PART OF THE LIKE CARISSA THAT WAS PASSED IN DECEMBER. GOT IT. SO I GUESS MY SECOND QUESTION RELATES TO THE ANSWER TO FUNDS WHICH I UNDERSTAND- ARE. I TO BE ALLOCATED BASED ON TITLE ONE GUIDELINES- GIVEN THE CORONA VIRUS HAS IMPACTED ALL STUDENTS- SHOULD THE STATE BE THINKING ABOUT ALLOCATING FUNDS TO HELP. THOSE DISTRICTS SUCH AS MANY WITHIN MY DISTRICT WHICH WILL RECEIVE A LOT LESS FUNDING UNDER THE TITLE ONE STRICTURES THAT ACCOMPANIED. THE ANSWER TO FUNDS. LIKE IN OTHER WORDS THE STATE TRYING TO UP THE- SINCE- ALLOWED THESE DAYS WILL BE- RECEIVING A LESS FUN. PLUS A ONE BERMAN UP. SO YES WE DID COULDN'T THAT SINCE- THIS IS WHY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR A PROBLEM NINETY ONE TIME FUNDS FOR THE BILLION FOR A REAL. AS WELL SUPPORT SIX BILLION IS COMP TO THE FEDERAL ARE BEING PROVIDED SINCE THE ARE OF THE- YOU KNOW THE TO BE. IS OF A TO. ELIGIBLE L. A. YOU KNOW APPLY BY SPECIFIC TIME FOR. AND MEET THE REAL. WOULD RECEIVE A SCREEN- AS WELL AS THE POINTS BILLION- IT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL ELEAZAR. SO YOU KNOW IT TO THE EXTENT THAT SCHOOLS. DON'T GET A PIECE OF THAT FOR ALL FUNDS THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO AT LEAST ACCESS SOME RESOURCES FROM STATE FUNDS. GOT IT AND A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THE ANSWER TO FUNDS AND I THINK THIS IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THESE ARE VERY VERY FLEXIBLE IN HOW THEY CAN BE USED. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHAT WHAT THEY'VE TOLD YOU AS FAR AS THEIR INTENTIONS FOR THEIR. USAGES OF THIS MONEY. YES SO. I BELIEVE DEPARTMENT HAD MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THAT. THE BULK OF THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE A LOT HASGONE TOWARDS- YEAH. BUILDING THE DISTANCE LEARNING STRUCTURE- THESE WERE FOR COSTS THAT WERE INCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WHERE. YOU KNOW MANY SCHOOLS HAD TO PIVOT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW. UP UP PROVIDE ALL IT BEAST LIKE TECHNO. TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY TO THEIR SCHOOLS AND OTHER STUDENTS AND COMPUTING DEVICES CONNECTIVITY- SO WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT. WHAT THE NEW USES WILL BE- WE DON'T HAVE ALL THAT DATA WE ONLY HAVE DATA FROM THE C. R. F. SO FAR SINCE THAT WAS THE SHORTEST TIME PERIOD BUT- YOU KNOW WE INTEND THAT SCHOOLS WILL START USING THIS NEW FUNDING FOR ON SCHOOL RE OPENING- ACTIVITIES AND- REALLY TARGETING FOR ACADEMIC INTERVENTION AND- HELPING CLOSE THE GAPS AND- CATCH STUDENTS UP. THAT AND THEN THE FOLLOWING FALLING BEHIND. OKAY AND THEN SO I GUESS MY FOLKS IS. YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE USING FOR BUT SOME OF THEM MIGHT USE IT FOR SCHOOL RE OPENING SOME OF THEM MIGHT USE THESE FUNDS FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- THIS PLEASE A LITTLE BIT IN THE NEXT TOPIC AND ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL RE OPENING PROPOSAL BUT- DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO PUSH FORWARD EARLY ACTION ITEMS THAT ALLOCATE. A HUGE AMOUNT OF PROP NINETY FUNDING FOR THESE PURPOSES. WHEN WE HAVE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT THAT MANY SCHOOLS MIGHT END UP USING. THAT FUNDING FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. RIGHT SO I THINK SCHOOL ARE NOW. THERE ARE AT. LEVELS OF YOU KNOW RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC AND IN THERE YOU KNOW PROCESS FOR RE OPENING. SOME ARE STILL KIND OF IN THE EARLY STAGES WILLARD THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS- YOU KNOW ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS AND YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY REQUIREMENTS TO CONTINUE LEARNING SO WE DON'T WANT TO. RESTRICT THE FUNDING IN THAT WAY AND YOU KNOW TRY TO DO A- A BLANKET. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO USE IT FOR WE KNOW THAT THERE'S LIKE VARYING LEVELS OF- YOU KNOW WHERE THIS SCHOOLS ARE IN IN THEIR PLANS FOR RE OPENING SO. I THINK WE'RE JUST WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP IT. AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE SO SCHOOLS CAN RESPOND TO- YOU KNOW ALL THE DIFFERENT CHALLENGES. BUT THE MAY BE FACING. RIGHT THANK YOU. LET ME THANK THIS PANEL. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE FIVE WHICH IS THE- EXPANDED LEARNING TIME AND ECONOMIC INTERVENTION GRANTS A SENATOR MEN SAID SOME OF THE DISCUSSION HAS.

ONE THOUSAND PER HOMELESS PEOPLE AND THE STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS WOULD RECEIVE SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS PER AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE- WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS ALLOCATED PROPORTIONALLY ON THE BASIS OF LCF STAFF TO BE ALLOCATED EQUAL PORTIONS- IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FUNDS ARE INTENDED BE USED FOR ACTIVITY THAT WOULD SUPPORT ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT INCLUDING EXPANDING INSTRUCTIONAL TIME.

EXPANDED LEARNING AND ECONOMIC INTERVENTION OPPORTUNITIES- THIS EXPENDITURE PLAN WOULD- WE NEED TO DETAIL HOW THEY WOULD. AN EX FOR. X. FOR A OF THE ALLOW PURPOSE WITHOUT X. TO BE A- WHEN IT IS A- AND WITH THAT- FOR I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. THANK THANK YOU MUCH AND AS WITH THE PANELS WERE. TAKE THE QUEST ONCE WE'VE HEARD FROM ALL THE SPEAKERS OR MOVE TO SPEAKER NUMBER TWO MICHAEL R. FERRIS. OF. FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE WELCOME BY. THANK YOU MICHAEL. BUT THE L. A. O. SAYS THE OF FINANCE FROM THE DETAILS OF THE PER. OR JUST TURN TO OUR- OUR WILL TO KNOW THE INTERESTS OF AS PER. WE ARE TAKING INTO A THE SIX DOLLAR AND ONE FEDERAL THAT WAS JUST DISCUSS IN THE PRE PANEL. COMBINED WITH THE AND S. TO FIND TO GO PROPOSED WOULD PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH TEN SIX BILLION DOLLAR IN THE THIRD ONCE FUNDING. THAT WE NEED TO BE SPENT BY THE END OF TWENTY ONE TWO. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE IS MORE THAN THE STATE SPEND ON ALL ITS FOR. PLUS ELSE YOU. WE HAVE A FEW CONCERN A GROUP SUCH LARGE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME IS. SCHOOLS IN ONE YEAR. FIRST GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING SOME REAL. SCHOOLS MAY HAVE DIFFICULT PLANNING AND SUCH A AMOUNT OF FUNDING OVER ONE YEAR. THIS IS PART THE CASE FOR ITS ARE- REQUIRE HIGHER. TO OR- INTERVIEWS ON TO THE. THANK IF THE ARE UNABLE TO PLAN FOR A LARGE OF NOWHERE. THEY MAY USE IT. FIVE TO COVER COSTS TECH. THAT THEY ARE PLANTS CONDUCT. THIS COULD RESULT IN NO AND BENEFITS IS. THIRD THEIR FACTS OF THE CASE. ON LEARNING AND WILL BE ARE NOT LIKELY TO SIX. AFTER WHEN YOU. FUNDING COULD PROVIDE BETTER TO SEE IF WAS SPENT ON ACT. OF ACTIVE OR- YOU. AND NOW TO SPEAK ARKAN WITH THEM OF FUNDING WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE BENEFITS PROVIDING. ADDITIONAL STATE FOR. MOST SINCE THE FED FUNDING A AND CAN BE YOU FOR THE SAME ACTIVITY INCLUDE IN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD BE YOU TO AND SCHOOL TO COME THAT TO THAT WOULD HAVE GREATEST BENEFIT FIRST. AND ARE TIED LEGISLATE PRIORITY. PARTICULAR WE THINK THE LIST MEANWHILE TO INCUR SCHOOL TO OUR ACTED. ENRICHMENT THIS SUMMER THAT WOULD BRING STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL. AND ALLOW THE TO ENTER WITH SCHOOL STAFF AND THEIR PEERS- ALLOWS SCHOOL TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES STUDENTS WITHOUT THEM. WITH EXTRA AND- OF. THAT STUDENTS TO BEGIN WITH DURING YEAR. PROVIDING THE SERVICES PERSON WOULD HELP AVOID THE WITH FACE WITH LEARNING FROM ALL. IN LINE WITH OUR SYSTEM THE PROPOSED HE RICK THE LET'S PROVIDE US AMOUNT A ONE TIME FUNDING TO JUST THIRTY LOS USING THIS. HELLO METHOD I PROPOSE BY THE GOVERNOR THROUGH THIS THE RALLY A LC OF. WE WERE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE FULL OF THIS ONE FUNDING TO INQUIRE SCHOOLS OFFER. THIS GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF SIX FUNDING BILL. WE THINK THAT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR IS A RE. AMOUNT OF FOR THE- OF THIS AMOUNT. WE SUGGEST ONE BILLION DOLLAR BE THERE FOR A ACT. IN ACTIVITIES. WE RECOMMEND A- SCHOOLS TO EXPEL THE FUNDS BY THE TWO TWENTY ONE. AND THAT ACTIVITIES MUST PLACE DURING IN USING AN INCREASE OR I MODEL. SO THE EXTENT OF THE- UNDER STATE AND PULLED HEALTH OR. FOR THE REMAINING FIVE MILLION. THAT WE SUGGEST. I RECKON THAT THE FUNDS WOULD FOR IN ACT. DURING THIS YEAR SO AS INCREASING AS TIME WORK BUT ADDITIONAL THE NEW COURSE OF SERVICE. WE ALSO ALLOWING THESE TO USE OVER A TWO YEAR PERIOD SO ALLOWED TO SPREAD OUT THE SERVICES FOR US TO. OVER A LONGER OF TIME. FINALLY IN REGARDS FOR YOU TO FUNDING THERE RESULTS PROVIDING SMALL AMOUNT THAN WHAT THE GUY PROPOSED. AND I WOULD MY CAN CALL. CALLED SORRY CALLING CAN. DISCUSS EARLIER. WOULD RECOMMEND THE LET'S TO RECTIFY. THE REMAINING FIVE FOR HIS PROPOSED TO FURTHER PAY DOWN. THE STATE'S ON SENDING TO. AND ADDRESS SCHOOL DO AND COSTING. IS AN ARGUMENT. IMPROVE SCHOOL RESILIENCY. IS THAT WOULD CREATE MORE. THE FOR SCHOOL TO. AND HELP THEM SYSTEM THE PROGRAM OVER TIME. THIS CONCLUDES OUR COM AND HABITS AND ANY. AT PREVIOUSLY WE MUST FOCUS ON ACCELERATED LEARNING FOR STUDENTS WHOSE FAMILIES WERE HARDEST HIT BY THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC WE NEED LEARNING EXPLORATION PROGRAMS INVESTMENTS EXPANDED LEARNING ACADEMIC COACHING. EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND BURKE MORE RESOURCES TO HELP RECONNECT HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REACHED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR STATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS AS THEY HAVE BEEN INELIGIBLE FOR OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING THUS FAR INCLUDING RECENT FEDERAL FUNDS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION FURTHER ON ON THIS PROPOSAL AND ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOB I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IT IT IN EFFECT IN THE PREVIOUS. BOB DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE OF THE INTERACTION OF- OF FEDERAL AND STATE. BUT I WAS GONNA ASK FINANCE. IF YOU HAD ANY RESPONSE. TO THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION THAT. A CHUNK OF THESE FUNDS. ARE BEING MOVED INTO SUMMER PROGRAMS GIVEN. IMPART HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN TO ACT ON SOME OF THE EARLY ACTIONS AND SECOND WAVE THAT THERE WERE FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS THAT SHOWED UP- DO YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSE ON THE- FAR AWAY OWES RECOMMENDATION TO SPEND MORE ON SUMMER PROGRAMS. CERTAINLY SOME LISTENING WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO YOU KNOW THESE FUNDS ARE LARGELY FLEXIBLE SO THEY WOULD BE YOU KNOW ELIGIBLE TO USE FOR SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WE DO THINK THERE SUFFICIENT NEED- RIGHT FOR SCHOOL SEEK FOR THIS FUNDING- YOU KNOW THIS DOESN'T. KNOW PROVIDING THIS ONE TIME FUNDS DOESN'T- NO PRECLUDE US FROM PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDS AS NEEDED IN FUTURE YEARS. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD ADD THANK YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO US ABOUT THAT MR FERRIS. YEAH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- WHY NOT THAT THE ONE OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE SEE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING WOULD BE TO JUST ENCOURAGE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SINCE THE SPECS OF THE FUNDING IS SO FLEXIBLE. AND CAN BE USED FOR THE SAME PURPOSES OF FEDERAL FUNDING THIS WOULD JUST BE TO ENCOURAGE SOME ACTIVITIES THAT WE THINK WE HAVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS AND ARE TIED TO. THE LEGISLATURE OKAY WE APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO I HAVE TO ASK YOU REALLY DIRECT QUESTION EVERY TIME YOU LEAN TO ONE SIDE AND MAKE A COMMENT HI WHAT APPEARS TO BE LA FROM LA SPORTS TEAM SEEMS TO JUMP OUT FROM BEHIND YOU RESPECT TO WHAT'S GOING ON BACK THERE. YEAH I'M FROM THE US AND CALIFORNIA ALSO A CO. OWNER CAL. GRANT WEALTH. THAT'S TRUE L. A. R. BOUNCE THE NORTH WITH THE SOUTH DON'T TAKE A FIRM POSITION IN. EITHER WHITE WALL WELL THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT QUESTION. CENTER MEN DO YOU HAVE BEEN. SENATOR MINUTES GOOD SO WHAT. LET ME THANK- ALL OF YOU FOR THAT. OF A PANEL ARE WE APPRECIATED AND I KNOW. SOME OF THE REPEATS AND WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. FOR US. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE- OF SIX THAN LAST ISSUE OF WHICH IS FISCAL HEALTH OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THE PANEL CONSISTS OF ONE PERSON I MIGHT FIND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFER OFFICER OF THE- FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM AND LET ME JUST SAY. AS MR FINE COMES UP THAT- I KNOW THIS WILL PROBABLY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN THE OTHER PRESENTATIONS BUT ALSO. THAT ONE I LOOKED AT HIS PACKAGE- IT LAUNCHED RIGHT INTO THE CHARTS OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE HAPPENING OR DISTRICTS ARE HAVING FISCAL PROBLEMS. AND THE AGENDA PACKET PROVIDES A GOOD BACKGROUND ON SORT OF THE HISTORY OF HOW WE'VE GOTTEN HERE SO THE TWO FIFTY GATHER. SO MR PHONE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU- THIS MORNING AS- SINCE- YOUR NEW IN YOUR ROLES- I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A SHORT BACKGROUND ON- THE FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM ALTHOUGH YOUR- AGENDA PACKET DOES A GREAT JOB ABOUT MONEY NOW WE ARE CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE WE ARE A COMPONENT PART OF THE OVERALL FISCAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT PROCESS REALLY IS FOCUSED WITH COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS AND FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS MR CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- WE WORK CLOSELY. ON A DAILY BASIS- WITH COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE DA- ACROSS THE STATE WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT ALSO WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THAT YOU HAVE- IF YOU. HAVE THIS MORNING- BERMAN OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF. LEGISLATIVE PANEL OFFICE CONTROLLERS OFFICE AND WE DO THAT ON A VARIETY OF- OF TOPICS BOTH OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL TOPICS THAT IMPACT- OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- STAFF REPORT INDICATES THAT WE SPEND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE SPEND ABOUT 90% OF OUR TIME ASSISTING DISTRICTS THAT ARE PROACTIVE IN REACHING OUT TO US FOR ASSISTANCE IN ONLY ABOUT 10% OF OUR TIME ON FISCAL DISTRESS- WELL THAT'S TRUE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO TO BREAK DOWN THE NINETY PERCENT. ACTUALLY IT'S ABOUT 70% WERE OF OUR TIME IS SPENT ON DISTRICTS THAT IT REACH OUT TO US AND ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE IN SOME REGARD- WE WILL ASSEMBLE A TEAM OF EXPERTS FROM OUR STAFF IN SYMPTOMS RETURNED. OUTSIDE OF OUR STAFF. TO ASSEMBLE A TEAM TO GO INTO A DISTRICT CAN ADDRESS THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. ARE THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR HELP ON- WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME IT'S FISCAL RELATED BUDGET RELATED LONG TERM FINANCIAL PLANNING- OF WRITING OF THIS TOPICS WE WILL OUR- TAKE ON ALMOST ANY TOPIC. INCLUDING SPECIAL EDUCATION TRANSPORTATION FOOD SERVICE OUR- THE BOARD STAFFING HOW HOW THE DISTRICT IS ORGANIZED IN THIS IT'S STAFFED APPROPRIATELY. TO MEET THEIR MISSION AND SO ON. ABOUT 10% OF OUR TIME IS SPENT ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WE CONSIDER THAT TO BE. ABSOLUTELY A LINCHPIN IN KEY TO AVOIDING FISCAL DISTRESS THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE JOB THEY'RE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WRONG AND SO TO THAT END WE- CONDUCT A NUMBER OF US A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ON OUR OWN BUT WE ALSO PARTNER WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES EVEN. TO DELIVER- BRIDIE OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTERS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITHIN THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ROUND UP ARE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE MADE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE TO THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. BY JUST DOWNLOADING THEM FROM OUR WEB PAGE THESE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE THE LCF CALCULATOR WHICH THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATEIT'S THE TOOL THEY USED TO ACTUALLY CALCULATE THEIR LCF REVENUES WE HAVE A PRODUCT CALLED PROJECTION PRO- WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS USED TO DO MULTI YEAR FINANCIAL PLANNING CASH MANAGEMENT. AND. CASH FORECASTING AS WELL. BUT TEMPERS OF OUR TIME IS SPENT ON- A ALEX. OF MISTER. OF PUBLIC FUNDS. COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY- TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS ABOUT AND USUALLY NOT ALWAYS BUT USUALLY WHEN THEY ELECT TO DO SO THEY TURNED TO US ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR STAFF- HAVE FRAUD- A CERTIFIED FRAUD EXAMINER- CERTIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE- SO WE'RE ABLE TO A SYSTEM. IN IN THAT WORK AND THEN IS THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES ABOUT 10% OF OUR TIME IS SPENT ON FISCAL DISTRESS AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS R. EIGHT WHAT WE CALL THE AB TWELVE HUNDRED. SYSTEM OF OVERSIGHT WORKS ACTUALLY VERY VERY WELL- THIRTY ALMOST THIRTY YEARS SINCE WE HAVE IN PLACE I WOULD HAVE NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT REQUIRED EMERGENCY PREPARATION IN AT THIRTY YEARS AND I THINK THAT'S TESTAMENT TO THE WORK OUR COUNTY OFFICES OF THE CHANCELLOR'S. OFFICE IN IN THE COLLECTIVE GROUP OF REALLY ALL OF US- THE IMPACT THAT DEATH SO THAT WE HAVE IN ASSISTING SCHOOL DISTRICTS ONE LAST NOTICE THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES THAT ARE PART OF OUR ORGANIZATION IS ALSO THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL INFORMATION SERVICES- THE BASE THERE IN SACRAMENTO- THIS IS A- LARGE SCALE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT- OPERATION OF BUSINESS ANALYST REQUIREMENTS ANALYSTS AND PROGRAMMERS AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. QUALITY ASSURANCE TESTERS AND HELPED US PEOPLE AND WE ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH A VARIETY OF DATA MANAGEMENT NEEDS FOR DATA RELATED TO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS AND ALSO ALSO FINANCIAL COLLECTION DATA ALONG WITH A. NUMBER OF OTHER- CONSIDER. IN SO WHEN TURN YOUR- TO THE PROCESS OR TO A REAL WHAT WE'RE HERE ABOUT AND HOW IS OF THE FISCAL STATUS OF OUR OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS- JUST TO REMIND YOU THE PROCESSES THAT EACH CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST ADOPTED BUDGET INSTRUMENT THAT BUDGET TO EITHER BE KEPT THEIR COUNTY OFFICE OR TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION BY JULY FIRST THOSE TO OVERSIGHT AGENCIES THEN DO A REVIEW AND BY MID SEPTEMBER- THEY HAVE A CHOICE OF EITHER APPROVING. APPROVING WITH CONDITIONS OR DISAPPROVING THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BUDGET. SO THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD REPORT ON IS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR A WE HAVE ONE DISTRICT WITH A DISAPPROVED BUDGET ONE OF THE ELEVEN CURTAIN. FIFTY YEARS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND THAT PARTICULAR DISTRICT- THIS IS THEIR- THIRD CONSECUTIVE DISAPPROVE BUDGET ARM THAT WOULD BE SACRAMENTO CITY UNIFIED. THE NEXT UP PROCESS RELATED TO OVERSIGHT- IN THERE ARE THEIR NUMBER STEPS IN THE ANNUAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUT THE NEXT RELATED TO CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. IS WHAT'S CALLED THE FIRST IN A REPORT IT'S THE FIRST OF TWO. IN A REPORTS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS PREPARING AGAIN SUBMIT TO THEIR COUNTY OFFICE ORDERED THE STATE DEPARTMENT- FOR- REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION THESE ARE- UPDATES TO THEIR BUDGET BASED ON A NEW ASSUMPTIONS NEW INFORMATION. SUCH AS ENROLLMENT IN IN AND SO ON THE FIRST ONE IS BASED ON DATA THROUGH OCTOBER AND IS DUE BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH I'LL BE REPORTING ON THAT TODAY BECAUSE THAT'S OUR MOST RECENT DATA. THE SECOND ONE IS DATA AS OF THE END OF JANUARY- AND IS REPORTED BY THE FIFTEENTH MARCH- IT SHOULD GIVE YOU A- QUICK OVERVIEW- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ANY DETAIL QUESTIONS BUT A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE DECEMBER FIRST IN REPORTS. WE HAVE FIFTY ONE DISTRICTS FALL QUALIFY ONE LET ME BACK UP A SECOND I'M SORRY STRUCTURE- COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT ROLE WITH THEIR GUARDIAN REPORTS THAN BUDGET A BUDGET AS INDICATED THE APPROVED. WITH CONDITIONS ARE DISAPPROVING IN REPORTING- THE DISTRICTS SELF CERTIFY A STATUS IN THAT STATUS IS EITHER POSITIVE QUALIFIED OR NEGATIVE POSITIVE IS THAT THINGS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND SUBSEQUENT TWO YEARS WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR WINDOW. BECAUSE PART OF THIS OVERSIGHT SYSTEM IS DESIGNED DESIGNED AROUND CONCEPTS AROUND EARLY WARNING SYSTEM SO WE WANT TO BE LOOKING OUT- DISTRICTS MAY CERTIFY QUALIFIED WHICH MEANS THEY MAY NOT MEET THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE CURRENT OR TWO SUBSEQUENT YEARS OR NEGATIVE WHICH MEANS THEY WOULD NOT BE THERE. ARE THEIR FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. ONE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. AND SO AT FIRST IN A REPORT. HI WE HAVE FIFTY ONE SERVE QUALIFY. DISTRICTS ARE AT THIS POINT IN TIME COUNTY OFFICES IN THE REVIEW PROCESS DID NOT CHANGE ANY OF THOSE COUNTY OFFICE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY IN THE AUTHORITY TO WHAT WE CALL DOWNGRADE DISTRICTS SUBMITTED POSITIVE THEY COULD DOWNGRADE TO QUALIFIED IF THEY SUBMITTED QUALIFIED THEY COULD DOWNGRADE THEM TO NEGATIVE WE HAD NO DOWNGRADES ALL FIFTY ONE OR SELF CERT. FIFTEEN ARM OF THESE FIFTY ONE THIS IS THEIR THIRD. OR MORE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED IN SO LITTLE DEEPER LOOK IN JUST THE TOTAL NUMBER- AND HOW MANY HAVE BEEN IN THAT STATUS. FOR MORE THAN A FOR THREE OR MORE TIMES. THREE OF THOSE FIFTEEN HAVE BEEN IN THE QUALIFIED STATUS FOR SEVEN OR MORE REPORTING PERIODS THOSE INCLUDE ALLAN ROCK UNION ELEMENTARY IN SANTA CLARA GOAL TRAIL ELEMENTARY IN ELDORADO IN OAKLAND UNIFIED IN ALAMEDA. WE ALSO HAD THREE AT FIRST INTERIM THREE NEGATIVE SELF CERTIFICATIONS ARE TO OUR CONTINUING ONE IS A SACRAMENTO CITY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR BUDGET DISAPPROVAL THE SECOND IS A SMALL DISTRICT BELL RIDGE. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN KERN COUNTY- AND IN THE CASE OF BELL RICH- THERE'S NO INTERVENTION BEING PROVIDED THERE CURRENTLY- AT THE LASTS UP GOING TO THE LAST STEPS OF THE PROCESS RELAXATION WHICH MEANS THE C. STORE OPERATORS AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A NEIGHBORING DISTRICT WILL TAKE THEM OVER THEY'VE LOST SUCH SIGNIFICANT. ENROLLMENT DUE TO A NEIGHBOR'S- SCHOOL THAT- THEY'RE SIMPLY GOING TO CEASE OUR WHAT WE CALL LAPSED ONE NEW ONE DISTRICT IS NEW TO THE NEGATIVE SIR CATION AND THAT IS TO- GROVE UNIFIED IN SACRAMENTO- SPECIFIC TO ELK GROVE A LARGE DISTRICTS SIMILAR TO SACRAMENTO CITY. OF BILLION UP GROUP'S CASE SO LONG HISTORY OF A WELL MANAGED DISTRICT STRONG RESERVES. THEY HAVE A SUDDEN SHIFT OF ENROLLMENT THAT WE BELIEVE IS ONE TIME IN NATURE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC- ARM AND THEY WERE ALSO AT FIRST INTERNATIONAL ARE ALL DISTRICTS USING- ZERO COLA. FOR THE OUT YEARS AND WHEN YOU UPDATE THAT COAL WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND YOU DO A DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS ON THE ENROLLMENT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL CERTIFY POSITIVE AGAIN- AT A SECOND INTERIM SO WE'RE IN A MONITORING. OF PHASE WITH A GROW A JUST TO A NOTE FROM HIS BEEN POSITIVE AND NORMALLY THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS IS A PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM POSITED TO QUALIFY DID NEGATIVE. ARM TECHNICALLY THEY DON'T MEET THE NEGATIVE OUR QUALIFICATION EVEN THOUGH THE CERTIFIED AS SUCH BECAUSE THEIR ISSUE IS THE THIRD YEAR OUT OF THE THREE YEAR WINDOW AND NEGATIVE WILL BE RELATED TO CURRENT OR NEXT YEAR I'M ONLY SO. WE HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT. THANK REFUSING TO THAT LIST- I WILL TURN THE VERY RAPIDLY- IN THEIR REPORTING WERE RIDGE AND SACK CITY. AYE WE ANTICIPATE WILL. IN THEIR NEGATIVES- AT SECOND IN OUR- IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE ALSO HAVE FOR LACK OF GOING CONCERN DISTRICTS OF LACK OF GOING CONCERN IS A TOOL THAT BOTH THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF ADD CAN USE. TO DESIGNATE A DISTRICT THAT IS RAPIDLY DETERIORATING AND THAT'S FISCAL STABILITY. IT IS SIMILAR IN NATURE TO A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION ACCEPTED A DISTRICT WOULD NOT SELF CERTIFY ITS OFFICE MARKET GOING CONCERN IN THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IT DOESN'T NEED TO DISTRICT IS LACK OF GOING CONCERN AT ANY TIME. DURING THE YEAR THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN INTERIM REPORTING OR IT BUDGET TALKING THEY CAN DO THAT ANYTIME IN THEIR VIEW THAT THE DISTRICTS FISCAL STABILITY- IS DETERIORATING. SO FAR THIS YEAR WE HAVE FOR LACK OF GOING CONCERN DISTRICTS OUR UNIFIED IN RIVERSIDE WHICH IS BEEN A LACK OF GOING CONCERN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS. BELLFLOWER UNIFIED IN LOS ANGELES MONTEBELLO UNIFIED IN LOS ANGELES IN ORDER WILL CITY ELEMENTARY. SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BUTTE COUNTY. AMONG THE FIFTY ONE QUALIFIED- THAT I REPORTED ON A FEW MOMENTS AGO IS ONE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. AMONG THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES IN THAT WOULD BE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ITSELF CERTIFIED- QUALIFIED. SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED ALSO SELF CERTIFIED QUALIFIED SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY IS A- A ONE OF OUR HANDFUL OF UNIQUE WHERE IT'S A SINGLE DISTRICTS SINGLE COUNTY THEY OPERATE ALMOST AS ONE IN THE SAME. BUT THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN A DISTRICT MEET CERTAIN- A CERTAIN STATUS OF MAP AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGES IN THOSE STATUS JUST BRIEFLY IS A NEGATIVE BUT IT IS A DISAPPROVED BUDGET A NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS A LACK OF GOING CONCERN OR DOWNGRADE IN THE CERTIFICATION BY THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT IF ANY OF THOSE FIVE TRIGGERS ARE MET. AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGES WITH THE DISTRICT AS OPPOSED TO OUR OUR MORE TRADITIONAL WORK WHERE WE WAIT FOR DISTRICT TWO- CALL US FOR ASSISTANCE ON THEREBEING THIRTY TWO TRIGGERS OF OUR AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT OVER THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS- OUR RESPONSE TO THAT AUTOMATIC ENGAGEMENT IS THAT WE USE A TOOL THAT WE DEVELOPED- A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND HAVE REFINED MORE RECENTLY IN THAT TOOLS CALLED THE FISCAL HEALTH RISK ANALYSIS. OF STRAIGHTFORWARD TOOLS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEB PAGE TO DISTRICTS CAN DOWNLOADED AND ACTUALLY DO A SELF ASSESSMENT IF THEY WANT- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DO IS WE COME IN AND DO. THAT- ANALYSIS. THE RIVER OF AN- IS TO RANK DISTRICT AS TO WHETHER IT'S LOW RISK MAYBE MODERATE RISK OR HIGH RISK OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OR RISK OF POTENTIAL INSOLVENCY. AND THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH- ED CODE FORTY TWO ONE TWENTY SEVEN POINT SIX. OF THE THIRTY TWO TRIGGERS TWENTY THREE OR SIXTY FOUR TWENTY THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN COMPLETED- WITH FIFTEEN OF THOSE ARE 65% BE IN HIGH RISK BEING LOW RISK. WE HAVE ONE IN DRAFT WE HAVE ONE IN PROGRESS WE HAVE ONE ON HOLD AND WE HAVE TWO OF THOSE THIRTY TWO THAT WOULD CANCEL. IN ADDITION AS A RESULT OF THE DECEMBER REPORTING WE HAVE FOR DISTRICTS THAT WERE CURRENTLY IN CONVERSATION WITH ABOUT STARTING THAT PROCESS BASED ON THE REPORTING THAT THEY DID THIS PAST DECEMBER. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHICH WAS- PASSED AT THE END OF THE FALL OF. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN- CHANGE THE WORLD HISTORICAL WAY THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT BECOME INSOLVENT- ARE A MANAGED OR ADMINISTERED DURING THE PROCESS. OF PREVIOUSLY THAT PROCESS WAS- NOT RESTED WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT- R. IT'S IT SHIFTED BACK TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE- LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY- TYPE OF PHILOSOPHY AND IT SHIFTED THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. IN ADDITION FOR TWO DISTRICTS IT PROVIDED ADDITIONAL UNRESTRICTED DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BASED ON THEIR FORECAST A DEFICIT. IN THE FORECASTED DEFICIT IS SOMETHING AFFECT MENTALITY AIDS EACH MARCH FIRST. WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR DISTRICT CITY STAFF REPORT NOTES. ON THE HAVE OUTSTANDING. MERCHANTS HERE PROCREATION LOANS FROM THE FROM THE STATE TO BAIL THEM OUT IF YOU WILL- WHEN THEY BECAME INSOLVENT- ARM. ONE THOSE DISTRICTS INGLE YOU IN LOS ANGELES CA. CONTINUE TO BE. EXTERNALLY BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE OTHER THREE DISTRICTS OAKLAND SOUTH MONTEREY COUNTY. JOINT UNION HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A VALLEJO CITY. UNIFIED OF WHILE THEY STILL HAVE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF THAT THEY'RE PAYING BACK THEIR LOCAL THEIR LOCAL CONTROL THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AUTHORITY HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THEIR LOCAL BOARDS- FOR THOSE- FOR THE THOSE OTHER THREE. ARE BUT FOR INGLEWOOD IN OAKLAND AB EIGHTEEN FORTY CALLED OUT SOME SPECIAL. IS IT A FUNDING- AND- FOR INGLEWOOD FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS- THAT'S BEEN A LITTLE OVER TEN. EARLY IN DOLLARS AND FOR OAKLAND FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT'S ABOUT SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ARE THESE THE PROVISIONS FOR THE SPECIAL FUNDING- THIS MARCH FIRST WILL BE THE LAST TIME WE ESTIMATE THERE DEFICIT SO NEXT YEAR NEXT FISCAL YEAR WILL BE THE LAST YEAR THEY'LL BE ELIGIBLE FOR- EIGHTY EIGHTY FUNDING. ABLE WOULD ASK FRST INTERIM ARE REPORTED A POSITIVE CERTIFICATION AND ARE NOT CURRENTLY FORECASTING DEFICITS SO THERE WON'T BE. A NEED BASED ON THAT ESTIMATE THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN FORTY MONEY FOR INGLEWOOD I HAVE STAFF IN INGLEWOOD RIGHT NOW VALIDATING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION- AS WE GET READY TO ISSUE OUR MARCH ONE LETTER. IN OAKLAND ARE THEY DID FILE QUALIFIED- INTERIM REPORT IT IS THERE I BELIEVE SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED IN REPORT. THEY ARE FORECASTING THE CURRENT YEAR DEFICIT OF AROUND THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OUR THEY'VE NOT YET ACCOUNTED FOR THE A ONE TIME AB EIGHTEEN FORTY MONEY FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR WHICH IS OVER SIXTEEN MILLION- AND SO ONCE THEY ACCOUNT FOR THAT THAT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AS EIGHTEEN FORTY DESIGNED IT TO BE- WILL- GO AWAY FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WE HAVE STAFF IN OAKLAND RIGHT NOW A WORKING TO LOOK AT. THEIR DEFICIT FORECAST FOR NEXT YEAR. CONCERNS ON THE HORIZON- WE WOULD INCLUDE- A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IN IN THAT LIST- SOME FOR- ACTION. BY US IN SOME FOR US TO MONITOR. ALONG WITH THEIR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. FOR ACTION WOULD BE DIXON UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN SOLANO COUNTY JUST SOUTH OF SACRAMENTO- SACRAMENTO CITY CONTINUE TO BE ENGAGED THERE AND MONITORING THAT. A WEST CONTRA COSTA UNIFIED IN WEST IN- CONTRA COSTA- COUNTY OF WOULD BE ADDITION A DISTRICT THAT WE'RE- GETTING READY TO ENGAGE IN. AND THEN LASTLY LOST HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT OR SMALL DISTRICT IN KERN COUNTY- TO EITHER ENGAGE YOUR MONITOR WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS OTHER LOSING ENROLLMENT AS WELL. AS THEIR NEIGHBOR BELL RIDGE. TO A CHARTER SCHOOL- ADDRESS SOLVENCY. YOU'VE HEARD THESE THEMES ALREADY VAST QUESTIONS AROUND THESE THINGS THIS MORNING- SO WILL CERTAINLY IDENTIFY WHAT WE SEE OUT THERE AS WE WORK WITH DISTRICTS THAT. ARE EXPERIENCING DISTRESS OR JUST WORK WITH THEM TO ASSIST THEM IN SOME WAY. THE FIRST IS TO NOTE THAT RESERVES ARE GENERALLY I'M HIGHER THAN THEY WERE AT THIS POINT IN THE GREAT-RECESSION JOBS DISTRICTS ENTERED INTO THE PANDEMIC AND THE INITIAL FORECAST LAST SPRING OF- A TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES AHEAD DUE TO A PANDEMIC INDUCED RECESSION. DISTRICTS ENTERED INTO THAT PERIOD- WAS MUCH STRONGER RESERVES THAN THEY DID IN- SEVEN AWAIT AS WE ENTERED THE GREAT RECESSION. AND BASED ON RECENT ANALYSIS WORK THAT THE ALI I. WAS DONE IN IN- THEY CAN SPEAK TO THE APP THEMSELVES- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THOSE RESERVES ARE I'M CONTINUE TO BE STRONG IN THE EARLY PART. OF THE PANDEMIC. TO HELP CARRY THEM THROUGH THE CURRENT YEAR- AND POSITION THEM WELL I'M GOING FORWARD. MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS IN MANY DISTRICTS TO SHOW DEFICIT TRENDS- THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THAT- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SIX SPECIALLY WITH THE- TWO YEAR COMPOUNDED CALL OF THREE POINT EIGHT NINE. THAT ESTIMATE WE BELIEVE THAT ONE ELEMENT OF A MOVING FROM A ZERO CALL OUT TO A FUNDED COLA AND- THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO REALLY- ACCOUNT FOR BOTH YEARS THE CURRENT YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. WILL PROBABLY TURN 2230% OF OUR FIFTY ONE QUALIFIES BACK TO A POSITIVE BASED ON OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS. WE KNOWTHAT IT WILL TURN AS I'VE ALREADY ALLUDED TO ONE NEGATIVE IN THAT'S ALL GROWTH. BACK TO A POSITIVE ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS THAT THEY'RE DOING ON THEIR ENROLLMENT TRENDS- THE MOST FREQUENT CONDITION AMONG QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS IS THAT OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT. ABOUT 60% OF CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING DECLINING ENROLLMENT OF THIS STARTED PRE PANDEMICS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS ARE WE CLEARLY SEE JUMPS IN. ESCALATION IN MEDICAL DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR A PREDOMINATELY A VERY EARLY GRADES- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN WHERE WE'RE GUESSING MOST. MANY FAMILIES ELECTED TO KEEP THEIR YOUNGEST KIDS HOME AND NOT BE ENGAGED IN DISTANCE LEARNING. THAT DATA ACROSS THE STATE IS- JUST BEING COLLECTED AND CERTIFIED- IN FINAL FORM THIS WEEK ARMAND SO THAT'LL BE DATA THAT'LL BE AVAILABLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT- IN THE COMING MONTHS. SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS IN IN THE FACT THAT SPECIAL ED COSTS OUTPACE SPECIAL AND REVENUE- ALSO IS A VERY COMMON THEME NUMBER ONE IS COMMON THING PROBABLY AND MOST IN ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT BUT FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING DISTRESS THAT GAP- IS NOTED ON MOST DISTRICTS IN DISTRESS HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS. TO SPECIAL ED PROGRAMS AND SOME OTHER DISTRICTS AND THEN FINALLY AS HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO A NUMBER OF TIMES THIS MORNING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES TO THE TO PENSION SYSTEMS THAT SERVE OUR K. FOURTEEN INSTITUTIONS AND THAT'S CASTERS IN CALPERS. ON AND REALLY THE CURRENT PROJECTED INCREASE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WHEN THE TEMPORARY RELIEF THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF THIS YEAR- AND FOR NEXT YEAR EXPIRES THE L. A- SPOKE TO THIS AND THEIR SUGGESTION TO POTENTIALLY. PUT MORE DOLLARS INTO THIS TOPIC TO SLOW THAT THE INCREASE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS WE LOOK OUT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR A NUMBER ONE WE HAVE- A SLOWING YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH PROJECTED- ARMENIAN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE IMPACTS OF THE VARIOUS EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS THE SPECIAL ONES ENACTED THIS YEAR DUE TO THE PANDEMIC THE TRADITIONAL ONES THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO RETURN NEXT YEAR SO FOR DECLINING ENROLLMENT DISTRICT THEIR REVENUES HAVE BEEN HELD HARMLESS THIS YEAR AND WILL BE HELD HARMLESS AGAIN NEXT YEAR- HOWEVER THAT ALL WILL CATCH UP TO THEM. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ON IN THE WORLD AT THAT POINT THERE REVENUES WILL BE IMPACTED BY- AN EXTREMELY A DECLINING AND- IN. WITH RESPECT AUDIT- THESE ARE THE AUTO SAID WERE CALLED UPON BY CAN SUPERINTENDENT- TO DO- OUR ACTIVITY AT THIS POINT IS DOWN ARE FROM NOR ARE WE HAVE A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR STAFF DEDICATED TO ONE PARTICULAR AUDIT I'M IN THAT IS A- THE NETWORK A NETWORK OF CHARTER SCHOOLS WE'RE LOOKING AT EIGHT AMONG THE- THAT NETWORK OF FOR INSPIRED CHARTER SCHOOLS OUT OF SAN DIEGO. COUNTY THERE ARE IN MULTIPLE COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE AND AGAIN WE HAVE EIGHT COUNTIES THAT HAVE ASKED US TO JOINTLY ASKED US TO LOOK AT THIS- THIS PARTICULAR CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT AUDIT PROCESS DOING TRANSACTION TESTING. ALL RIGHT NOW. ADJUSTED LOOK YEAH COMMITTEE. ARE REALIZED THE FOCUS YEARS K. TWELVE BUT- WITH RESPECT TO FITNESS WORK- WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THREE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LASSEN IN LASSEN COUNTY. PALOMAR IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND PERALTA IN ALAMEDA COUNTY WE'VE ISSUED REPORTS INVOLVE PERALTA AND PALOMAR A PREVIOUSLY. ARM LASSEN WE HAVE ISSUED ONE REPORT AND AS OF THIS MORNING WE'RE ACTUALLY SAYS- HOUSING OR GAUGE WITH THEIR OF THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS NOT FULLY COOPERATING. WITH US AND SO THE CHANCELLOR NEEDS TO GIVE ADDITIONAL DIRECTION. WE ALSO ON OUR WATCH LIST HAVE A CITY COLLEGE OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS A LONG HISTORY OF KIND OF IN AND OUT OF- AJ. STRESSFUL TIMES FISCALLY. ON IN WE'RE CURRENTLY- THEY'RE CURRENTLY ON OUR WATCH LIST. WITHOUT MISTER CHAIR I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THEY'LL DEFER. ANYTHING YOU'D WANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I HAVE A BRIEF COMMENT A COUPLE OF. IN MY BRIEF COMMENT IS IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE YOUR CHART BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE THE FIRST TIME AND IT HAS BEEN TWELVE YEARS SINCE I LEFT. WE HAD SOME BIG- PROBLEMS AND NOW I SEE THEM ON YOUR CHART BEING NEAR THE END OF THEIR LONG PAYMENT WHETHER IT WAS THE- OAKLAND SCHOOL DISTRICT OR THE VALLEJO SCHOOL DISTRICT AND- AND- I'M PROBABLY THE ONLY PERSON IN THE LEGISLATURE THE WENT K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND VALLEJO SO HIGH. WATCH THAT VERY CLOSELY. ARM TWO QUESTIONS IN ONE JUST CAME UP FOR ME AT THE END OF YOUR- OUR COMMENTS. WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN OUR- SOMEBODY DOES NOT COOPERATE WITH YOU ON AN AUDIT. AND YU JUST MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A CASE WHERE THAT WAS HAPPENING WHAT WHAT HOW DO YOU PROCEED TO TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. WELL IN IN IN THIS PARTICULAR REFERENCES I WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IS AN HONOR WERE THERE TO ASSIST THE AS OPPOSED TO ACTUALLY AUDITING AND SO WERE THERE TO LOOK- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN LASSEN ON THEIR ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT. PROCESS BECAUSE THEY'RE LOSING A SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT. IN LOOKING AT THAT AND THEN THERE WAS A NUMBER OF TASKS THE CHANCELLOR ASKED JUST TO LOOK AT CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ACCESS TO LOOK AT SOARED TAKEN KIND OF ONE BY ONE- WHAT. WERE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE'RE GONNA PAUSE- AND RE ENGAGE WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE- THE COLLEGE ITSELF AND MAKE SURE THE- BODY THEY WANT US TO CONTINUE TO BE THERE AND IF THEY DO THEN WILL. WILL RETURN AND CONTINUE TO PLUG ON- MOST. WEIGHT WHEN A DISTRICT WHETHER TO K. TWELVE OR COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVING FISCAL DISTRESS ARE LOOKING FOR ASSISTANCE AND WE'RE JUST. WE'RE PART OF THAT- INTERVENTION PROCESS THAT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT CAN CALL UPON. TO HELP WOMEN IN MOST CASES. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LET'S SAY IN THE COUNTY OFFICER EXACTLY ON THE SAME PAGE. THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD TOGETHER THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING QUICKLY TURNING- THE DISTRICT AROUND. FROM A FINANCIAL SYSTEM STABILITY STANDPOINT INSTAGRAM EVERYBODY'S WORKING ON. THE SAME NOTE THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL I. ALL HAVE ROLES AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF QUAN. WE DO X. PERIODS WHERE- THERE'S A LACK OF COOPERATION- AND THOSE ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT- TASK TO DO WE DON'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO JUST GO IN AND DO X. Y. Z. AND HELP THEM STRONG SUPERINTENDENTS MAY HAVE SOME LIMITED AUTHORITY IN THAT WORK IN THAT REGARD- BUT THOSE ARE DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERAL OF THOSE IN THIS PAST YEAR- MISTER CHAIR IF YOU WANT ME TO USE AN ANALOGY THAT. THAT I THINK MOST OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GAUGED IN ABOUT JUST BECAUSE WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE. AND THAT'S A TWELVE STEP PROCESS TO HELP SOMEBODY WITH A- INDEED SEE ON ON ALCOHOL LET'S SAY- IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT AUTHOR WHAT THE TWELVE STEP PROGRAM YOU'RE USING STEP NUMBER ONE IS ALWAYS THE SAME. AND THAT'S TOOK KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM I USE THAT SAME ANALOGY WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN FISCAL DISTRESS- DISTRICTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS- THAT LEND THEMSELVES TO. TURNING THAT DISTRESS AROUND IMMEDIATELY AND STABILIZING THE VERY FIRST THING THEY DO IS THEY KNOWLEDGE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. AND THAT'S OFTEN WHEN THEY REACH OUT TO US ORIGINALLY ORDERED THEIR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT REACHES OUT TO US FOR ASSISTANCE- BUT SOMETIMES THEY ADVANCED TO THE ANGER STEP BEFORE THEY- START WITH THE ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM STUFF. FOLLOW- LEAVE I'LL LEAVE THAT OUT BUT YES THERE'S SOME SOME INTERNAL. DISCUSSION IN ANNA. AND SOLDER AND WELL I HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION AND I THINK YOU ANSWERED IT BUT LET ME JUST MAKE SURE. OF BECAUSE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE COLA REALLY MOST PEOPLE. ARE OUT OF CERTAIN SIR THREATEN TO SPACE. ARE ARE YOU SEEING ANYTHING THAT IS SORT OF SPECIFIC COMING OUT OF COVERED AND- PANDEMIC THAT IS. CAUSING YOU TO HAVE ALERTS ABOUT CERTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WELL CERTAINLY THE PANDEMIC- PRESENTS ITSELF AS YOU AWFULLY APPRECIATE US SOME SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES ARE IN MANY RESPECTS WHY WE THOUGHT THE PANDEMIC WAS GOING TO PRESENT. A KIND OF EQUAL CHALLENGES AROUND FINANCE AND FISCAL STABILITY IN OPERATIONS- SPECIFICALLY TEACHING OPERATIONS ARM THE REALITY IS THIS WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A DIFFICULT BUDGET THIS YEAR WE CERTAINLY HAVE A VERY. POSITIVE BUDGETS OF THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED FOR NEXT YEAR SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE A BUDGET PROBLEM PER SE THAT WE WERE EXPECTING THIS YEAR. AND NEXT YEAR THINGS- AS YOU KNOW REVENUES- HAVE NOT FOLLOWED THE FORECAST- IN HAVE BEEN MUCH IMPROVED SO THEY'RE REAL THEY'RE REAL CHALLENGES ARE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES- SPECIFICALLY TEACHING HI MY WIFE IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER SO SHE'S BEEN RIGHT HERE. WITH ME IN OUR HOME OFFICE- SINCE MARCH. THIRTEENTH OF LAST SPRING- OUR SON IS IN HIS FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL TEACHING THIS YEAR ALL DOING IT VIRTUALLY I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE A NEW TEACHER STARTING OUT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT- THOSE ARE THE REAL CHALLENGES IN YES THEY ARE FISCAL. ISSUES RELATED TO THOSE THE IN PERSON RETURNING THE IN PERSON AS YOU NOW ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED TO MEET SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES- DURING THE DISTANCE LEARNING CERTAINLY THE CHALLENGES AROUND THE TECHNOLOGY DIVIDE. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT SPOKE TO IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SPOKEN TO- TO SUPPORT DISTANCE LEARNING- A LOT. OF SUNLIGHT I THINK THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL WITH OMINOUS SENATOR MENIFEE. HAS ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION- I HAD A BUNCH BEFORE YOU STARTED YOU ANSWERED ALMOST ALL OF THEM WHICH IS A- I THINK A TESTAMENT TO YOUR THOROUGH- PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE THAT- I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING CORRECTLY YOU WERE. DISCUSSING I GUESS WHAT I WOULD DO IS LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUES WITH SOME OF THESE DISTRESSED DISTRICTS. OR DISTRESS COOLS AND VERBES WOULD BE SOME OF THE CALL VISIT DRIVEN- CAUSES THE DESTRUCTION I THINK WHAT YOU SAID IS THAT AMONG THE LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS. WE'RE REALLY LOOKING. AT- THREE ISSUES DECLINING ENROLLMENT. IS SPECIAL ED AND- SPECIAL AND REVENUE AND AT PENSION FUNDING. IS THAT A CORRECT SUMMARY OF WHAT YOU STATED IT ASSUMING WE GET OUT OF COVER THOSE IN THE LONGER TERM ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING. ABSOLUTELY SIR THOSE THOSE ARE THE THREE OF. OUR PREVAILING CONSISTENT ELEMENTS IN MOST OF THE DISTRICTS REPORTING A QUALIFIED RIGHT NOW THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT- IN THIS IS SCOTT BOTH THE GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS ASPECT TO IT. AND THAT IS THAT THE ONE TIME NATURE FUNDING RIGHT ALL DOLLARS ARE IMPORTANT SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHIN THEIR RECURRING OR THERE ONE TIME THE ONE TIME PRESENTS CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY WHEN. THE NEED THAT THEY'RE ADDRESSING MAY GO BEYOND THE TIME PERIOD AND YOU HEARD THAT ALREADY FROM THE DISCUSSION WITH THE AUDIO AND FINANCE. A TODAY IN THEIR PROPOSALS- AND SO THAT'S THE ONE ELEMENT THAT I WENT OUT TO THE HOUSE THAT'S A DIFFICULT PLANNING EFFORT FOR DISTRICTS. TO THEIR COMMUNITY THEY'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS MORE RESOURCES IN YET THEY'RE STILL REPORTING DISTRESS. AND SO THERE'S A COMMUNICATION ISSUE THEIR UNDERSTANDING BY THEIR COMMUNITY AND THERE'S THEIR BROADER STAKEHOLDERS- OF THEIR CONDITIONS. THANK YOU WITH US A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT I APPRECIATE.
