HAVING THE CONTROLLED END IT ALL.

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:23.622

WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH FREEDOM

00:25:32.597 --> 00:25:34.132
WHEN INDEPENDENCE AND ADULTHOOD

00:25:34.199 --> 00:25:36.801
LOOMS AHEAD ASKING FOR HELP

00:25:36.868 --> 00:25:38.703
FEELS LIKE A STEP BACKWARDS?

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:40.772
I'VE GROWN UP FORTUNATE SO WHEN

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.040
I STARTED FEELING DEPRESSED I

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:44.175
FEEL GUILTY LIKE I DIDN'T

00:25:44.242 --> 00:25:44.776
DESERVE TO FEEL THE WAY THAT I

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:46.945
DID.

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:48.246
BUT THE LONGER I HELD IT IN

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:48.546
[inaudible]

00:25:48.613 --> 00:25:51.549
THE MORE.

00:25:51.616 --> 00:25:53.118
THE MORE A GOTTEN GOTTEN -- MY

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:55.153
GRADES STARTED TO SLIP SECOND

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.888
SEMESTER OF MY FRESHMAN YEAR.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.456
AND SCHOOL STRESS ISOLATED ME

00:25:58.523 --> 00:26:00.125
FROM REALITY.

00:26:00.191 --> 00:26:00.859
THEN I STARTED GETTING

00:26:00.926 --> 00:26:02.727
VALIDATION FROM A BOY TWO YEARS

00:26:02.794 --> 00:26:05.463
OLDER THAN ME -- IN A WORLD

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.632
WHERE GRADES DISPLAYED WORTH I

00:26:07.699 --> 00:26:09.834
FELT LIKE MORE THAN THAT TO HIM.

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:11.970
AND THIS IN SECURITY AND BLIND

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:13.905
TRUST ME TO BE IN A BATHROOM

00:26:13.972 --> 00:26:15.340
WHERE I WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

00:26:15.407 --> 00:26:16.841
BY THE TRUSTED PERSON I TRUSTED

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:17.943
THE MOST.

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:20.211
HE LEFT ME AND I FELT HUMILIATED

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:22.080
I FELT LIKE MY ONLY OPTIONS WERE

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:23.014
TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT ALONE OR

00:26:23.081 --> 00:26:24.249
KILL MYSELF.

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.084
BECAUSE REACHING OUT WOULD MEAN

00:26:26.151 --> 00:26:27.786
SURRENDERING ANY FREEDOM THAT I

00:26:27.852 --> 00:26:28.753
DID HAVE.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.388
AFTER GETTING HOSPITALIZED IN

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:31.823
PROCESSING WHAT I'D BEEN THROUGH

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.391
WITH A NEW THERAPIST I HAD A

00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:34.826
NEED TO CHANGE OUR SUPPORT

00:26:34.893 --> 00:26:36.194

ALL CO HELPED ME FIND MY CONTROL

00:26:37.796 --> 00:26:38.830
AGAIN.

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:39.965
IT GAVE ME HOPE THAT OTHER

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.901
ADOLESCENTS WHO FELT LIKE I FELT.

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.602
CAN GET HELP AND THAT SELF

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:46.137
AWARENESS AND REACHING OUT FOR

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:47.472
SUPPORT WOULD BE TREATED AS A

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:49.541
SIGN OF MATURITY AND STRENGTH AS

00:26:49.607 --> 00:26:51.009
OPPOSED TO WEAKNESS.

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:52.877
I NEEDED A SPACE THAT WASN'T AT

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:54.813
SCHOOL A PLACE I COULD GO TO TO

00:26:54.879 --> 00:26:55.380
BE VULNERABLE.

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:57.983
NOT FEEL LIKE A LIABILITY ISSUE

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.918
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT I

00:26:59.985 --> 00:27:00.852
WOULD HAVE GONE TO ALTHOUGH IF

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:01.953
IT WERE BEEN IT'D BEEN A

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.455
POSSIBILITY FOR ME.

00:27:03.521 --> 00:27:05.190
BUT HAVING THAT SAFETY NET AND A

00:27:05.256 --> 00:27:06.958

00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:08.927
RESORTING AND SUICIDE NEEDS TO

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:10.462
