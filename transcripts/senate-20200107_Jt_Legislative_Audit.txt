HEARING OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE TO ORDER TODAY WHICH IS WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE HONOR THE AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN NOVEMBER. I JUST TWO MONTHS OLD TWO MONTHS AGO TITLED- DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ITS FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY ADMINISTER THE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATION PROCESS- MAY DELAY INJURED WORKERS ACCESS TO BENEFITS WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO FOR REQUESTING THE AUDITS- ENSURING THAT. CALIFORNIANS WITH JOB RELATED INJURIES RECEIVE WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS IN A TIMELY MANNER IS AN IMPORTANT WORTHWHILE ISSUE. HI WHAT MANY OF US HAVE NOT SUFFERED A SERIOUS. INJURY AT WORK KNOCK ON WOOD MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE. FOR MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THESE CLAIMS INVOLVED A QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR. AS MANY PEOPLE HERE TODAY MAY KNOW QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATORS ARE PHYSICIANS WHO EXAMINE INJURED WORKERS WHEN DISPUTES ARISE BETWEEN WORKERS AND THEIR EMPLOYERS REGARDING MEDICAL ISSUES. BECAUSE OF THESE DISPUTES AND DISPUTES WHETHER WORK BECAUSE THE INJURY. THE EXISTENCE OR EXTENT OF A PERMANENT DISABILITY OR THE NEED FOR FUTURE MEDICAL CARE. TODAY WE WILL DISCUSS THE RESULT OF AN AUDIT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS REGARDING ITS ADMINISTRATION OF QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATORS WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT'S PLANS FOR IMPLEMENTING CHANGES. AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS INCLUDING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP INSURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH MEDICAL EXAMINERS THAT THE DISCIPLINE PROCESS FOR THE MEDICAL EVALUATORS. IS APPROPRIATE AND MEDICAL REPORTS ARE COMPLETE AND MEET STANDARDS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES I HAVE. ALREADY IN. SOME WOMEN REYES I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT ONE OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S KEY RECOMMENDATIONS A. B. THIRTEEN EIGHTY. WHICH IS AIMED AT INCREASING THE INCENTIVE AND PAY FOR MEDICAL EVALUATORS TO ENSURE WE HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM. AS OUR REPORT POINTS OUT OTHER RATES HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED OR INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND AS A STATE AUDITOR FOUND THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT INSURE THAT IT HAS ENOUGH MEDICAL EVALUATORS KEEP UP WITH THE GROWING DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES. AS STATED IN THE REPORT THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT MEDICAL EVALUATORS CAN DELAY INJURED WORKERS ACCESS TO BENEFITS AND ALSO INCREASED COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS. MY GOALS FOR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING IS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WHAT THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND DURING THE AUDITS. ALSO TO SEE A COMMITMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP ACHIEVE MISSION OF MINIMIZING THE ADVERSE IMPACT. OF WORK RELATED INJURIES ON CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS. THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF PEOPLE WERE INJURED THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE MEDICAL. THAT THEY NEED SO THAT HE CAN GET BACK TO WORK I CAN TELL YOU THAT ANECDOTALLY I'VE SPOKEN TO. BOTH INJURED AND ACTUALLY SOME OF THE DOCTORS THAT WORK IN THIS FIELD- AND PEOPLE JUST WANNA GET BACK TO WORK. BUT THE OUR FIRST WORKERS ARE FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY HAVE TO WAIT MONTHS AND SOMETIMES OVER A YEAR. EVEN SEE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR. AND SO HOPEFULLY TODAY WE COULD NAIL DOWN SOME OF THESE ISSUES. WHERE THERE'S- A HURDLE MAYBE WHETHER IT'S LEGISLATIVELY OR THROUGH- BUDGET CORRECTIVE ACTION WE CAN HELP- INSURE THAT WERE HELPING WORKERS BUT ALSO. IN DOING THAT. I BELIEVE IT'LL BRING DOWN COSTS FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. SO I CAN SEE I COULD SEE. A PATHWAY WHERE THIS COULD BE A WIN WIN FOR EVERYONE. SO WITH THAT I KNOW WE HAVE- SOME OPENING COMMENTS- LET ME DEFER TO CENTER IRAQ THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AFTER WE HAVE A- CAT OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ASSEMBLY BEAR ASSEMBLY WOMAN I RUBIO PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR CALLING SUPPORT AN OVERSIGHT HEARING- AND FOR A LONG ME TO SPEAK TODAY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK THAT THE STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOWELL AND HER TEAM OP FOR THEIR DILIGENT A PROFESSIONAL WORK I'VE WORKED WITH YOU NOW FOR THREE YEARS AND- I REALLY TRULY APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK THAT YOU WHEN YOUR DEPARTMENT DO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON. THIS TYPE OF WORK TO GET ON THE ANSWERS THAT I THINK CALIFORNIA DESERVE SO THANK YOU AGAIN- AS THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL Q. IN THE AUDIT REQUEST I WAS CERTAINLY CONCERNED- WHEN READING THIS AUDIT REPORT MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THE INJURED WORKER IT'S CLEAR THAT THE DELAYS IN THE SYSTEM HAVE A DIRECT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THESE WORKERS- MORE THAN THAT I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR. THIRTEEN YEARS AND WE THINK ABOUT THE INJURED WORKERS AS JUST FOLKS OUT. YOU KNOW THAT ARE COLLECTING OR WAR OR TRYING TO SEE- GET SOME RECTIFICATIONS FOR IT FOR THEIR THEIR- WORKERS COMP ISSUES. HOWEVER AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER ARE. WORKERS COMPENSATION OF. BUDGET WAS OVER FOUR MILLION DOLLARS I AND IT'S GROWING BECAUSE OF- THE LACK OF SERVICES AND THE LACK OF- EXPEDIENCY WITH US OF. FOLKS ACTUALLY GETTING TO SEE A CURE ME AND SO THE IMPACT IS FISCAL NOT JUST TO THE STATE BUT TO A LOT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IF WE TALK ABOUT- THE LACK OF MONEY IN SCHOOL IN SCHOOLS THIS TAKES A BIG CHUNK OUT OF GENERAL FUND FOR A LOT OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO. THE IMPACT- I SAW IT AS A FIRST. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT OUR GENERAL FUND I WOULD PAY FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER WORKERS COMPENSATION ISSUES AND SO FOR ME OTHER THAN YOU KNOW AGAIN- THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING THE INJURED WORKERS BACK TO WORK OR AT LEAST THE COMPENSATION THAT THEY DESERVE- I ALSO SEE IT AS A FISCAL ISSUE FOR A LOT OF OUR LOCAL. GOVERNMENTS IS AND- SCOLDED THEN I THINK I'VE SHARED WITH MOST OF THE TEACHERS ARE BACK MONEY IS NOT GOING INTO THE ASSEMBLY WERE THE SCHOOL AFTER SPENDING IT IN OTHER WAYS AND THE OF THE LATE SHOW THAT- LACK. EXPEDIENCY I. ALL TOO BUSY THESE AND I AM YOURS AND HURTFUL TO THE TO THE YACHT CHLOE'S SO FIXING THE QUEUE NB PROGRAM. OF WILL PROVIDE. RAPID BENEFITS TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM- BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE INJURED WORKER IN OUR GREAT STATE WHO REALLY WE DESERVE BETTER- THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AND I HOPE THAT THIS AUDIT OR THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING CAN. CAN GIVE US- UP SOME. VISION AS TO WHERE WE GOAL- FORWARD WITH THIS AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US I KNOW THAT THERE THAT WE HAVEN'T- SEEN EYE TO EYE ON THE ON ALL OF THE ISSUES. BUT I THINK IF WE SIT AND WORK TOGETHER- THE GOAL OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS THE SAME AS OURS TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING TAKING CARE. AND I AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND TALK. TO US ABOUT- WHAT WE CAN DO NEXT FOR THE INJURED WORKERS. AGAIN THANK YOU TO CHAIR FOR LONG ME TO SPEAK. THANK YOU WE ASK THERE'S ADDITIONAL OPENING COMMENTS IF NOT. LET ME GO AT NIGHT THANK CENTER ROSSITER MORE ROCK AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO FROM HERE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND WE- EXPECT. SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS IN AND OUT IN THE- ASSEMBLY WILL. HAVE FOR MATH. PASSENGER WIENER. CAN MOPPING OUR- DAUGHTER POP OUT AS WELL B. THIS TIME LET'S GO AHEAD AND CALL FIRST PANEL. IT WILL BE OVERVIEW. FINDING COMMENDATIONS. MISS ALL OUR CLAIMS. CALIFORNIA. STATE AUDITOR AND THE MISSING SENIOR AUDITOR. THANK YOU. SO THE REGISTER GIVE US A CERTAIN BACKGROUND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL TONYA YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOWELL THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WITH ME AS MICHELLE SAUNDERS SHE WAS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO MEMBERS A STEP YOU THROUGH THE KEY ISSUES IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE DO HAVE TO HAND OUT I THINK THE SERGEANTS HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT- AND WHAT I'LL DO IS I'LL GO THROUGH THE KEY ISSUES THAT ARE LISTED ON THE FIRST PAGE. AND THEN THE REMAINING PAGES OF THE HANDOUT ARE ACTUALLY. FIX THAT WE LEFT OF THE ARTERY. YOUR LIST. THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN WHAT WE HAVE CONCERNS AND THEN WE ALSO. ARE MICHELLE WILL GO OVER SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT ONLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT CERTAINLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT. OF INDUSTRIAL ASIAN SPECIFICALLY THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. SO WITH THAT THERE ARE THREE KEY ISSUES AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE FIRST PAGE THREE KEY CONCERNS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE OUT REPORTS CERTAINLY THE SUPPLY OF Q. ENEMIES. THE WE BELIEVE THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE OF Q. ARMIES IN CALIFORNIA- TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT THOSE ASSESSMENTS. THE SECOND ISSUE IS THEIR PRACTICE- THAT THEY'RE FOLLOWING FOR DISCIPLINING Q. ENEMIES AND OUR CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. IT RAISES DUE PROCESS CONCERNS AND I'LL EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT. AFTER A DISCUSS THE THIRD ISSUE THIRD ISSUE IS THE DEPARTMENT WHICH IS A WORKERS COMPENSATION DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION HAS RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK THE Q. ARMIES ARE DOING I IS HELP HIGH QUALITY AND SATISFY CERTAIN STANDARDS THAT ARE SET OUT. IN REGULATIONS ARE SO THAT A WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGE CAN RELY ON THAT PARTICULAR INFORMATION IF NECESSARY SO BATES THERE THE DIVISION HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE REPORTS ARE ARE MEETING STANDARDS AND ARE OF HIGH QUALITY. SO THOSE ARE THE THREE KEY ISSUES FIRST ISSUE AS FAR AS THE- DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FAILING TO ADDRESS THE SHORTAGE. WE LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW. ON THOSE FIVE YEARS WE ARE FISCAL YEAR THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THREE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AND WHAT WE SAW IS THE SUPPLY OF Q. AMIS IS DECLINING- IT DECLINED STEADILY. DURING THAT TIME FRAME ABOUT 12% SO THERE'S OVER THREE THOUSAND AND YOU'LL SEE IT IN A GRAPHIC OVER THREE THOUSAND Q. ARMIES. I ATE IT DROPPED DOWN TO LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED Q. AMIS. AT THE SAME TIME FRAME REQUESTS FOR EVALUATIONS INCREASED 37% THERE WERE ABOUT-A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND ALMOST A HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND REQUESTS FOR THESE TYPES OF EVALUATIONS. IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN WE GOT TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT INCREASED TO OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND REQUEST. OFF FOR AN EVALUATION SO YOU'RE SEEING A DECLINE IN THE AND THE SUPPLY THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN CONDUCT THESE EVALUATIONS. AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF EVALUATIONS BEING REQUESTED. IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR THIS FROM SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS WE DIDN'T DRILL DOWN SPECIFICALLY INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT CERTAIN SPECIALTIES. THE SITUATION IS EVEN WORSE THERE ARE SOME SPECIALTIES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF Q. AMIS AVAILABLE TO CONDUCT THESE TYPES OF EVALUATIONS AND WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OR THE DIVISION. THAT THEY NEED TO REALLY DO THEIR BEST TO RECRUIT AND WE'LL GET INTO SPECIFICS ABOUT HOW- WE THINK THEY SHOULD DO THAT IS GETTING MORE QUEUE UP IN THE SYSTEM. AND REALLY IDENTIFYING SCRUPULOUS THE AREAS OF SPECIALTY. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE AND WHERE THERE'S A HIGH A REQUEST FOR THOSE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT TYPE OF EXPERTISE. SO THAT- THAT- THOSE TWO THINGS REALLY DO COINCIDE AS FAR AS NUMBER OF Q. ARMIES GOING DOWN NUMBER OF REQUESTS INCREASING. WHAT THAT ALSO IS SEEN IN THE DATA AND YOU'LL SEE IT IN ONE OF THE GRAPHICS IS. Q. M. E. R. WORK SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE SEEN IN BY A MEDICAL LEAVE BETTER WITHIN STE DAYS OF REQUEST. IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITHIN SIXTY DAYS EVERY SPENT PANEL CAN BE REQUESTED AND WE HAVE A GRAPHIC IN THE REPORT THAT WE WILL SHARE WITH YOU IT'S IN YOUR PACKAGE. SHOW THAT. SAME FIVE YEAR WINDOW. THE NUMBER OF REAP SPENT ALSO THE CIVIC DUE TO THE FACT THAT A Q. ME WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO CONDUCT THAT. THAT EVALUATION WITHIN SIXTY DAYS MORE THAN QUADRUPLED IT WENT FROM ABOUT 460-021-9000 AND A FIVE YEAR WINDOW. SO YOU'RE SEEING FEWER AND FEWER KEEP Q. EMMYS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT WORKER EVE VALUE WAIT THE SITUATION AND HOPEFULLY GET. THE INFORMATION. THAT THAT DIVISION WORKERS COMP NEEDS THE EMPLOYER NEEDS AND CERTAINLY THE AN INJURED WORKER NEEDS TO GET THAT CASE RESOLVED SO THEIR- DISABILITY AND THEIR BENEFITS CAN BE PROVIDED BUT- IF THEY ARE. ULTIMATELY DEEMED PERMANENTLY DISABLED A DECISION IS MADE AND BENEFITS AND THAT THE SITUATION CAN GET RESOLVED. NOW THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION ACKNOWLEDGES THERE'S A DECLINE AND DECREASING NUMBER OF JIMMY'S THEY DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH OUR CONCLUSION THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF Q. ENEMIES. THEY FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME AND- A NUMBER OF Q. AND HE'S IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT. THE REASONS FOR. THE REPLACEMENT PANELS IS BECAUSE IT'S CONCENTRATED IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF Q. ARMIES OR CERTAIN GROUP OF Q. AMIS WHO HAVE X. NUMBER OF OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA. WE DID ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS AND WE REALLY WERE ABLE TO DISPUTE THAT- WE HAD OUR I. T. FOLKS REALLY LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY Q. ARMIES WITHIN CERTAIN ZIP CODES WITH THAT'S HOW THEY IDENTIFY CUMAE. AND WE WERE ABLE TO ESSENTIALLY TO PUT IT IN AND- SUCCINCT TERMS DISPUTE THAT THAT ASSERTION THAT THERE IS NOT A SHORTAGE THERE ABSOLUTELY IS A SHORTAGE NOT TO MEET IS THE CLUE ENDING NUMBER REQUIRE IS INCREASING. NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT CALLS AS YOU'LL SEE IN THE GRASS. QUANDARY THEN IF YOU'RE WHAT I'LL SO THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED CALIFORNIA. WE HAD SOME- REASONS THAT WE DISCUSS IN THE REPORT. WE THINK THE MEDICAL FOR LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED IT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX- THE DIVISION HAS TAKEN SOME STEPS TO TRY TO DO THAT BUT- MEDICAL COSTS HAVE INCREASED OVER 30% SINCE THAT TIME FRAME YET YOU'RE NOT SEEING AN INCREASE IN THAT MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE. WE DID AN ANALYSIS ARE. JUST USING- INFLATION CURRENTLY. THE FEES ARE. ARE SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR A BASIC EVALUATION JUST BASED ON INFLATION THAT WOULD BE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS- IF THEY HAD JUST INCREASED IT. THAT WAY WE ALSO BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE PROCESS FOR CREATING TO AYE MEANS THAT THE DIVISION NEEDS TO BE MORE PROACTIVE. IN DOING THE ANALOGIES USING THE STUDIES HAVE THAT IDENTIFY. OUR SEARCH SPECIALTIES WERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGES AND TRY TO WORK WITH MEDICAL GROUPS WORK. UP INDIVIDUALS KNOWS DIFFERENT COMMUNITY IS TO TRY TO GET MORE VISIT IS TO BE WILLING AND SPECIALIST TO BE ARE WILLING TO BE Q. ARMIES- SO THEY REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE THEIR DATA SO THAT'S- THAT'S THROUGH THE GRAPHICS. AREA NUMBER TWO VERY QUICKLY- DISCIPLINING THE PRACTICES FOR DISCIPLINING THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEPARATE TRACKS FOR. DISAPPOINTING ACUMEN ME IF THERE ARE. INACCURATE INCOMPLETE- POOR QUALITY REPORTS- AND THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE TRACK FOR Q. ME TO GET REAPPOINTED. THE CONCERN WE SAW AND WE LAY OUT IN THE AUDIT REPORT IS IF THERE ARE COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THE QUEUE A MEET WHAT WE WERE SEEKING IS THAT RATHER THAN. TAKING THAT THROUGH THE DISCIPLINARY TRACK THING THAT CUBA ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TENDS TO DISPUTE. OF THE COMPLAINTS ARE THE ALLEGATIONS. THE ALLEGED VIOLENCE. I DID CHEN IS WAITING A BILL THAT INDIVIDUAL IS UP FOR RE APPOINT. AND BASICALLY DIDN'T THE REAPPOINTMENT ON THE ALLIGATOR. SO WE WERE REYES CAN IN THE RIVER THAT THERE MAY BE. A DUE PROCESS. IT HERE AND WE HAD EXAMPLE THE REPORT. PLEASE COMING IN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN THE QUEUE ARMY IS ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT. DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION LOOKS AT IT DOESN'T. DENY THAT REAPPOINTMENT PERSON ISN'T UP FOR REAPPOINTMENT UNTIL JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN IS DENIED THE REAPPOINTMENT. BASEDON SOME OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME IN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN- SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL. ARE WAS SUBJECT TO IS NOW HERE SHE I DON'T RECALL IF IT WAS A MALE OR FEMALE BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO CONTINUE. SERVING AS A CUE I ME SO LOSING INCOME NOT FOR THIS I OF CUBA MEANS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR INJURED WORKERS TO SEE- AND REALLY IS PUT IN A POSITION WHERE. THEIR AN INCENTIVE THAT'S CREATED FOR THAT SECURE ME TO TRY TO SETTLE THE CASE SO HERE SHE CAN GET REAP AND CAN. SERVICE SO WE REALLY HAVE SOME CONCERN WITH HOW THE DIVISION CARRYING OUT DISCIPLINE WHERE THEY DO HAVE A SPECIFIC TRACK THEY COULD BE FOLLOWING BUT THEY ARE USING. THE ABILITY TO DENY A REAPPOINTMENT. AS ESSENTIALLY DISCIPLINE AGAINST SOME OF THESE COMMITTEES AND THEN THE THIRD ISSUE. IS THE HIGH QUALITY REPORTS THERE IS STATUTORY REQUIREMENT STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES THE DIVISION. TO EVALUATE A SAMPLE NOW AND CONTINUOUSLY LOOKING AT A SAMPLE OF REPORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT Q. ARMIES ARE DOING A GOOD JOB OF. OF PROVIDING THE APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EVIDENCE NECESSARY. TO MAKE. THE PROPER DECISION WITH RESPECT TO A DISABILITY WITH. RESPECT TO THE pWORKER WOULD BE ENTITLED TO BUT WE WERE NOT SEEING WE HAVE NOT SEEN- EVIDENCE OF CONTINUOUS REVIEW OF THESE MEDICAL REPORTS PROVIDED BY Q. ARMIES. SAID ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE WAS ONE ATTACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN. WHERE THEY STARTED LOOKING AT SOME REPORTS THEY PULLED A SAMPLE OF A HUNDRED REPORTS. UP LOOKED AT ABOUT SIXTEEN OF THOSE REPORTS AND PROBLEMS ACCORDING INDIVIDUAL AT VISION WHO WAS REVIEWING. FOR SOME THEN THEY SAY YES TO SEARCH FOR SAY. DID ANY OF ANY OF THE OTHER REPORTS THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANY DO. REVIEWS OF REPORTS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW UP ON ANY OF THE ISSUES THEY IDENTIFIED IN THOSE REPORTS SO ABOUT FIFTY REPORTS- SO WE REALLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. OF THE DAY MISSIONS EFFORTS AND THERE IS STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO THESE EVALUATIONS- AND ALSO TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE PROGRAM. DO THE Q. ARMIES NEED SOME TRAINING DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE TYPE OF REPORTING THAT THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE INCLUDING IN THEIR REPORTS. SO THAT THIRD ISSUE RELATED TO THAT THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS IS THE FINAL ISSUE THAT WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT ALTERNATE OVER TO MICHELLE SHE'LL STEP YOU THROUGH. THE GRAPHICS IN THE REPORT THAT WILL ILLUSTRATE- EACH OF THE EACH OF THESE THREE ISSUES THAT IDENTIFIED SO. MICHELLE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS MICHELLE SANDERS THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE TEAM LEAD ON THE ON IT. THANK YOU SO BEFORE I WALK YOU THROUGH THE PACKET. IT'S KIND OF BEEN DESCRIBED A LITTLE BIT AT A HIGH LEVEL ALREADY BUT ALL KIND OF GIVE ANOTHER OVERVIEW OF THE QUEUE MEANS HOW THE PROCESS WORKS JUST. FOR CONTEXT AS WE GET INTO THE PACKET. Q. MEANS OUR PHYSICIANS. ARE INVOLVED IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION PROCESS WHEN THERE'S A DISPUTE BETWEEN THE INJURED WORKER AND THE EMPLOYER. AND AS YOU SAID EARLIER THAT. THAT COULD BE ABOUT WHETHER THE INJURY HAPPENED AT WORK. OF THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY. AND SO WHEN THERE IS A DISPUTE TO THE PARTIES CAN REQUESTED A B. C. TO PROVIDE A QUEUE IN ME. THEY PROVIDE A PANEL OR A LIST OF THREE Q. AMIS. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPRESENTED WORKERS IN ON REPRESENT WORKERS IN ALL COVER THAT. IN ANOTHER SLIDE. BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY SELECT ONE OF THE Q. AMIS TO PERFORM THE EVALUATION. AND ESSENTIALLY THEY'LL PRODUCE A REPORT THAT. THAT JUDGES ARE OTHER PARTIES WILL USE TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE NOW WITH THE QUEUE IN ME IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED- VERY THEY CAN REQUEST A REPLACEMENT PANEL AND ESSENTIALLY THE PROCESS STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN AND THEY'LL END UP SELECTING A QUEUE IN ME SO Q. MEANS ARE LIKE WITH SAID EARLIER VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS IN RESOLVING THE DISPUTE SO THAT THESE UNDER WORKER'S CAM- BENEFITS. SO IF YOU TURN TO THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WILL START WITH THE FIRST ISSUE WHICH WAS THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF A Q. AMIS AND HERE REALLY SHOWING THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH CUTE MEANS TO ME TO ME AND WHEN THE TOP LINE BRAFF SEE THE NUMBER THOSE REQUESTS FOR ME SERVICES IT'S INCREASED OF TIME. AT THE SAME TIME IS THAT THE DEMAND IS INCREASING SUPPORT INCREASING 12% AT IS THIS- MENTION WE DIDN'T SEE THAT CERTAIN SPECIALTY OR WORSE. THAT AND THE OVERALL SITUATION. AND SO. AGAIN THIS IS REALLY AN INDICATOR THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH Q. MEANS ON THE SYSTEM AND IF THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH Q. MEANS I CAN IMPACT THE INJURED WORKER IN GETTING THEIR BENEFITS IN A TIMELY MANNER. IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE THREE. THIS IS STILL ILLUSTRATING THAT FIRST ISSUE THAT WE SAW THAT Q. MEANS A BECOME MORE FREQUENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SO LIKE I SAID EARLIER WHEN THERE'S A QUEUE ME IS NOT AVAILABLE WITHIN THE FIRST SIXTY DAYS THEY CAN REQUEST A REPLACEMENT PANEL SO THAT'S THIS YELLOW BAR HERE. AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IT'S QUADRUPLED ITS STATE WATER MENTION IT'S QUADRUPLED OVER THIS FIVE FIVE YEAR PERIOD WHICH REALLY MEANS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH Q. NEEDS TO MEET THE DEMAND AND THAT HAS AN IMPACT ON THE INJURED WORKER. SO IN THE CASE WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE INTERPRETERS IN THE CASE OF AN AVAIL. Q. MEANS. THE CASE. IT BY MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AND SO AGAIN THAT'S IMPACTING INTO A WORKER IN GETTING THEIR BENEFITS. BUT ALSO- WHEN WE TALK TO AN APPLICANT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE PRESIDENT INDICATED THAT. SOME INJURED WORKERS MAY ACTUALLY DELAY GETTING TREATMENT UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT THEIR BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE. SO THIS DELAYED CAN IMPACT THAT AS WELL. THE THING IS THE STATE AUDITOR ALSO MENTIONED THIS ALSO INCREASES COSTS FOR THE EMPLOYERS IT'S NOT JUST THE INJURED WORKERS ARE IMPACTED SAID. THE EMPLOYERS AS WELL. AND THAT'S A STATE WATER MENTIONS DUE TO BE SEE IS NOT NECESSARILY ACKNOWLEDGE A SHORTAGE AND HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION IN THOSE THREE AREAS. THE UPDATING THE FEE SCHEDULE. A RECRUITING. AND USING THEIR DATA SPECIFICALLY TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS OF SAY THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SHORTAGES. ANDS. THE SPECIALTIES SO OUR RECOMMENDATION TO D. W. C. IS pTHAT PLAN FOR HOW IT'S GONNA RECRUIT WHAT SPECIALTIES IT'S GOING TO WHAT HAVE THE GREATEST SHORTAGES AND FOCUSING ON THAT AREA. YOU CANNOT WE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT USE DATA TO KIND OF FOCUS ITS EFFORTS AND IT CAN USE THAT DATA TO IDENTIFY WHERE THE GEOGRAPHICAL SHORTAGES MAKE SURE THE THIRD ADDRESSING YOU'LL TARGETED TARGETED APPROACH. SO WE ALSO HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS TO REQUIRED GDC TO REVIEW AND UPDATE THE FEE SCHEDULE AND WE PUT IN THERE TO AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS BASED ON INFLATION I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE. A TRANSLATION PENDING EXACTLY. SO OUR SECOND RECOMMEND. IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. MEANS ON THE PANEL. ENDS THAT'S REALLY TO REDUCE THOSE DELAYS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THESE REPLACEMENT PANELS AND I'M ACTUALLY GONNA EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU IN MORE DETAIL ON THE NEXT SLIDE. IF YOU. SO THE TOP OF THIS PAGE IS SHOWING WHAT THE PROCESSES RIGHT NOW AND THE BOTTOM HALF IS WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATION ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PAGE D. W. C. GENERATES THAT PANEL OF THREE KILOMETERS. AS I SAID EARLIER THE REPRESENTED IN ON REPRESENTED THE DIFFERENCE ON THE LEFT SIDE THE UNREPRESENTED WORKER THERE'S THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM ANY OF THE THREE ON THE- ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE REPRESENTED WORK. WHAT OUT OF THE THREE THE INJURED WORKER ELIMINATES ONE THE EMPLOYER ELIMINATES ONE AND THEN THEY HAVE ONE TO CHOOSE FROM. NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA WE SAW THAT REPRESENT A WORKERS IT WAS THREE TIMES HIGHER THE NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT PANELS AND THAT MEANS THEY'RE EXPERIENCING MORE DELAYS ON THAT SIDE. SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO INCREASE THIS PANEL SIZE FOR THE REPRESENTED SIZE SIDE TO FIVE. TO HAVING FIVE SOL EXPLAIN WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE ON THE BOTTOM HALF THE PAGE WE NEED MORE Q. ARMIES FOR THAT. YES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT HE TO BE SEE SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN IT'S USING IT'S DATA. TO FIGURE OUT WELL HOW HOW MUCH HOW MANY Q. MEANS DO THEY NEED. TO SO OTHER. THE PAGES ARE PROPOSAL SO THE UNREPRESENTED WORKERS SIDE ON THE LEFT IT WOULD STAY THE SAME THEY WOULD STILL HAVE THOSE THREE TO CHOOSE FROM. ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE REPRESENTED SIDE. OUT OF THE FIVE IT WOULD STILL BE THE INJURED WORKER WOULD ELIMINATE ONE. THE EMPLOYER WOULD ELIMINATE ONE AND THEN YOU'D HAVE THREE TO CHOOSE FROM. SO THAT'S REALLY TO HELP REDUCE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE- A REPLACEMENT PANELS AND BETTER ENSURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE. AND AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE INJURED WORKER HAVING THEIR BENEFITS DELAYED GREATLY IMPACTS ON. SO THAT'S THE FIRST ISSUE THROUGH THE SLIDES OF YOU TURN TO THE- NEXT PAGE FIVE. A DELIVERY SEE AN APPROPRIATELY DISCIPLINE Q. MEANS AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR INDICATED THERE'S THESE TWO TRACKS THAT ARE LAID OUT AND REGULATIONS THE LET SIDES THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND THE RIGHT SIDES A RE APPOINTMENT PROCESS AND WE FOUND THAT D. W. C. INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING ITS DISCIPLINARY PROCESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH. BEFORE IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE THERE WOULD BE A HEARING TAX DETERMINED THAT AN ALLEGATION WAS IN FACT VIOLATION THEY DENIED REAPPOINTMENT IN SOME CASES THAT WE LOOKED AT BASED ON THOSE ALLEGATIONS SO THEY ACTUALLY USED THE REAPPOINTMENT PROCESS DISCIPLINE I'M I'M I INTERRUPTED SO SICK CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN SO. THE PRIOR TO THE DISK AND WHAT WOULD DIE AFTER THE HEARING SO THE HEARING WAS IT HAPPENING EXACTLY OKAY THE HEARING WAS NOT HAPPENING AT BUT THEY WERE DENIED THE APPLICATIONS BASED ON JUST THE ALLEGATIONS THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU. RIGHT SO. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS ONCE THE CURE ME IS DENIED AS A STAY HONOR POINTED OUT EARLIER. THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE QUEUE ME SUPPLY. MAKES THAT SHORTAGE WORSE. THEY CANNOT EARN RELATED INCOME WHICH MEANS THAT THEY MAY BE INCENTIVIZE TO SETTLE. SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK TURNING THEIR INCOME AND THEN THAT THEY MAY BE DENIED DUE PROCESS. AND SO ARE WE O HAVE A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THIS SUBMIT HELP ENSURE THAT THE THESE TWO PROCESSES STATE SEPARATE AND SO WE- OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE WC. TO HAVE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT LAY OUT THESE TWO AS SEPARATE PROCESSES. AND AGAIN THAT WAY TO THE WHOLE DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT. WHAT'S THE DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT YES. EXACTLY TO HELP ADDRESS THE DUE PROCESS HELP MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CUNY'S STAY IN THE SUPPLY UNTIL THEY ARE IN FACT YOU KNOW HAVE A VIOLATION AND THERE NEEDS TO BE DISCIPLINED. SO IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE PAGE SIX WILL TALK ABOUT THE THIRD AND FINAL ISSUE THAT THE STATE AUDITOR COVERED. SO. TWC IS NOT REVIEWING A TO ME REPORTS FOR QUALITY. AND SO THESE ARE THE REPORTS THAT AFTER VALUATION THE QUEUE ME RIGHT TO REPORT AND THE JUDGE IS OR OTHER PARTIES USE THAT TO RESOLVE THAT DISPUTE. SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THOSE REPORTS ARE HIGH QUALITY HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION. SO D. W. C. THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN STATE LAW OF. THAT THE REQUIRED TO DO WERE IN RELATION TO. REVIEWING FOR QUALITY IT'S RICK REVIEWING A RANDOM SELECTION AND ALSO HAVING AN ANNUAL REPORT PROVIDED TO THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE TO DIRECTOR ABOUT THAT REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW ENDS THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE. AND WE SAW THAT THEY WERE THEY WERE NOT DOING THAT EXCEPT FOR THE ONE CASES THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED. SO THEN. WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE JUDGES ARE DOING IF IT IF A JUDGE GETS THE REPORT AND IT DOESN'T HAVE WHEN IT NEEDS TO HAVE IN IT THE JUDGE MIGHT THROW IT OUT. OR THEY MAY ASK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION WHICH MEANS MORE DELAYS FOR THE INJURED WORKER SO THEY MAY HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT OR THEY MAY HAVE TO ENTER THE QUEUE IN THE PROCESS. ALL OVER AGAIN. SO WHEN WE TALK TO- CHIEF JUDGE SHE PULLED HER JUDGES AND- THEY INDICATED THAT. THEY REJECTED ABOUT SEVENTY REPORTS IN IN THE LAST YEAR. BASED ON THEM THE REPORTS I HAVE AN INFORMATION THEY NEEDED TO HAVE IN THEM. SERVERS TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE. AND SINCE D. W. C. DOES NOT TRACK THAT THEY CAN ONLY PROVIDE US WITH ONE OF THE REJECTED REPORTS. SO BUT TALKING TO THE JUDGE FOUND A LOT MORE EXACTLY THIS GOES TO THE QUALITY OF THE REPORTS. SO ARE RECOMMENDED WE HAVE I'M SORRY I DID NOT A QUESTION TO GET FIT SO SOUL WHY WEREN'T THE TRACKING THE REPORTS IT IS. IT WILL BRING HIM UP THERE THE NEXT PANEL. RIGHT SOLD SO THEY HAD NO DATA. EXACTLY THE SAME THE COULD LEAD SOME I GUESS THE QUESTION IS OUT OF THOSE REPORTS THAT THE JUDGES CHAU DO THEY ONLY HAD ONE OF THE REJECT THE REPORT THEY CAN ONLY PROVIDE US WITH ONE REJECTED REPORT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SO THEN THEY WILL THEY'RE NOT TRACKING HOW MANY WERE THEY WERE NOT TRACKING. HOW MANY WERE THERE DO YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS A SYSTEM FOR THEM TO TRACK THIS REPORT CARD WHERE DID THEY GO THEY HAVE NOT THEY DIDN'T SYSTEM THEY DURING THE AUDIT THEY STARTED DEVELOPING A TRACKING SHEET BUT HADN'T STARTED USING IT. YET. OKAY SO ARE RIGHT. SO WE HAVE A RECOMMENDATION OKAY FOR THEM TO START TRACKING FOR ITS TO THINK. PARK TWO THINGS. SO FOR THE JUDGES TO COMMUNICATE TO D. W. C. THAT THEY REJECTED A REPORT AND THEN FOR. D. W. C. TO THAT ALSO TRACK THE REPORTS. OKAY WALL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS I THINK BECAUSE HOW OLD TO THE INJURED WORKERS NOW. SOMEONE BECAUSE HE OKAY SO LET ME RETRACT. SO WHEN YOU SAID THAT WHEN. SOME OF THESE. REPORTS WERE NOT- COMPLETED THEY WOULD HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN SEOUL IF A REPORT WAS REJECTED WHAT WAS THE REMEDY FOR THE INJURED WORKER CHIU THEN. APPEAL MAY BE OR DO ANYTHING A BASED ON THE REJECTION AND WHO WOULD THEY GO TO CAN THEY GO BACK TO THAT THE COURT OR OR TO THE JUDGE OR WOULD THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. THE W. C. AND THEN AT THAT POINT THEY DON'T HAVE THESE REPORT ARE. WHAT IT WHAT WAS THE REMEDY FOR THE REJECTION. SO WHEN THEY REJECT THE REPORT- IT'S REALLY THAT THE- THE- INJURED WORKER WILL THEN HAVE TO GO BACK EITHER THROUGH THE QUEUE ME PROCESS TO SEE A NEW KILL ME. SO THAT THEY CAN EVALUATE THEM AGAIN. AND THEN PRODUCE A NEW REPORT THAT CAN BE USED OKAY SO THEN THEM OUT AS FAR AS TIME FRAME- YOU SAID THAT WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. OF A REQUEST THEN THERE'S A CURE ME AND IF THERE WAS NOT AN AVAILABLE KIMMY THEN WE HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN SO- IN TERMS OF TIME WAITING WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE OR IF. IF I'M AHEAD OF MYSELF PLEASE LET ME KNOW BY. THEN THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A YEAR TWO YEARS OF WAITING. BEFORE ANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE RESOLVED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T TRACK THE REJECTED REPORTS WE DON'T HAVE ABOUT THE WAITING BUT- BUT WHEN WE DID LOOK AT IN THAT FIRST SECTION WHEN THERE'S A REPLACEMENT PANEL THEY OFTEN IT WAS DELAYED MORE THAN. TWO MONTHS THAT'S A- GRAPH THAT QUADRUPLED SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN RIGHT. RIGHT BUT BUT THECONCERN THE CONCERN IS TWOFOLD DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE REPORTS THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TRACK THE REPORTS. BECAUSE STATE LAW REQUIRES SUGGESTS THAT IF THE Q. AND ME HAS FIVE REJECTED REPORTS HERE SHE CANNOT GET REAPPOINTED AS A CURE ME. SO THE DIVISION HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE QUALITY OF THESE REPORTS AND UNDERSTANDING WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S INACCURATE INCOMPLETE ARE THE JUDGES REJECTING THE WORKERS COMP JUDGES HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT TO THE DIVISION. AND SO THE FAILURE IS ON BOTH SIDES ITS DIVISION WORKERS COMP AND ALSO THE PRESIDING JUDGES NOT REPORTING TO THE CHIEF JUDGE WE ASK THE CHIEF JUDGE DO YOU TRACK. REJECTED REPORTS BECAUSE YOU'RE REQUIRED TO REPORT IT BACK IN THE DIVISION HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY THIS QUEUE NB IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE BECAUSE HERE SHE'S NOT. TOO MANY REPORT GETTING REJECTED AND THAT'S- BAD FOR INJURED WORKERS CERTAINLY AND CERTAINLY FOR EMPLOYERS THE CASES AREN'T AND RESOLVED. SO WEAK WE- WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU INFORMATION TO SAY OF THOSE SEVENTY REPORTS- BECAUSE AGAIN BUT THEY THEY PULLED THE JUDGES- AND THE JUDGES SAID YEAH THAT'S HOW I AM I PROBABLY REJECTED TEN FIFTY IT'S AN ESTIMATE. IS ALL ANECDOTAL INFORMATION AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM SO- THE DIVISION NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB THE JUDGES AND THEY THEY ASSERTED DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT THEY WOULD START TRACKING. REJECTED REPORT SO NOW WOULD BE AN MISSION HOPE THE DIVISION HAS MEASURE. OF TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S BEEN SEVEN. HOW MANY REJECTED ARE YOU TRACKING IT BY Q. A ME YOU SHOULD BE ARE YOU IDENTIFYING ISSUES IN THOSE REPORT WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE REPORTS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO TELL YOU YOU NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TRAINING ACADEMIES TO PREPARE BETTER QUALITY REPORTS- SO WE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR YOU MS RUBIO AS FAR AS WHAT THE DELAY AS AS AS MISS SAUNDERS INDICATED A REPLACEMENT PANEL TYPICALLY IS GOING TO DELAY IT AT LEAST ANOTHER SIXTY DAYS BY- IF NOT LONGER ALL IN SOME CASES IF IT'S- THE JUDGE SAYING OUT WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER Q. ON ME WE NEED A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. THEN THAT Q. AND ME IS DOING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR THEY- AND THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPOSE THE CURE ME SO IT CLEARLY CREATES ADDITIONAL DELAY AT A MINIMUM IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBABLY A SIXTY DAY DELAY IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE EVEN LONGER WELL AND THEN ON THE FLIP SIDE YOU SAID THAT AFTER A CURE ME GETS FIVE REPORT JACK DEAD AND THEY'RE NO LONGER. THEY WEREN'T EVEN PACKING SO EVEN IN THE EVENT THAT THERE WERE SOME BACK YOU AND IS WE WERE NEED AND KICKING YOU KNOW REJECTING THEM. BECAUSE OF THE OF FAILED BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S KEEPING TRACK THAT'S CORRECT AND THERE'S A STATE LAW THAT ROUTE THE REGARD REAPPOINTMENT RIGHT IF I AS A Q. AND ME HAVE HAD FOR MORE THAN FIVE FIVE I THINK IT'S MORE THAN FIVE REJECTED- I CANNOT GET REAPPOINTED AS A CUE ME SO THEN WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM THAT SOME OF THE BAG AND THESE WERE NOT EVEN BEING REJECTED CORRECT BECAUSE NOBODY'S KEEPING TRACK OKAY CORRECT. THANK YOU. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE DONE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION OF FINE. OF SENATOR ROTH AND- UP I WOULD JUST LIKE AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY TO ANSWER THE I'VE GOT OTHER QUESTIONS BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT. SO WHEN A QUEUE IN ME HAS A REJECTED REPORT THAT A JUDGE DETERMINES IS INSUFFICIENT DOES THE QUEUE IN ME AND IS THE CURE MAY ENTITLED TO BE PAID FOR THAT REPORT. INMATE AT BEST MAYBE THE QUESTION NEEDS TO GO TO DID OF YOU SEE. BUT IF PART OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS DETERMINED TO DETERMINE LEGISLATIVE FIXES TO THIS PROCESS. AND IF SOMEBODY IS TURNING OUT. REPORTS THAT ARE REJECTED AND THEY DON'T GET PAID. THEN I SUGGEST THAT THEY'LL PROBABLY EITHER FIX THE REPORTS IN THE FUTURE OR THEY WILL DROP OFF THE QUEUE IN THE PANEL WE CAN REPLACE THEM WITH SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS A TO DO THE JOB. THIS MADE UP A QUESTION DO YOU I'M- CONTENT TO WAIT TO THE NEXT PANEL BUT I'D LIKE FOR SOMEBODY ANSWERED BEFORE WE FINISH. THANK YOU SENATOR AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I WOULD ASSUME THAT. HOPE THAT THE DIVISION WOULD HAVE THAT. GREAT JEFF ANYTHING ELSE- I WOULD JUST GOING TO CLOSE IT OUT WITH JUST OUR RECOMMENDATIONS I MENTION THAT THE TWO BEFORE TO SO THAT THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE JUDGES WHEN THEY REJECT THEM TO TRACK TO TELL THE WC AND THEN FOR D. W. C. TO TRACK THEM BUT THEN ALSO AS I SAY THE BEGINNING THE OTHER TWO THINGS THAT NEED TO BE SEE WAS NOT DOING WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THEM TO ESTABLISH POLICIES PROCEDURES FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT RAND SELECTION YOU FOR QUALITY. AND THEN TO FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REPORT THAT TO THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO AGAIN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU THE THESE. FOR QUALITY REPORTS COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO DELAYS FOR THE INJURED WORKER AND INCREASED COSTS FOR THE EMPLOYERS. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU LET ME ASK JUST ONE FOLLOW UP BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HEARD AND FOR THE NEXT PANEL. IN THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE AUDITS THEY OBVIOUSLY. I DON'T AGREE WITH. WITH YOUR ASSERTION THAT THERE'S A LACK OF TWO EMMYS RIGHT CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT AND WHY YOU DISAGREE WITH THEIR RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT. WELL I THINK THE INFORMATION IN THE REPORT CERTAINLY IN THE GRAPHICS ILLUSTRATE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF JIMMY'S AVAILABLE WHEN YOU HAVE. A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF Q. ENEMIES AND YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT A 37% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR PANELS. ANALYSTS TO CHOOSE FROM AND THEN YOU SEE THE STATISTICS WE IDENTIFIED WHERE YOU'VE GOT REPLACEMENT PANELS. SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED BECAUSE AQ ME WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE TO CONDUCT THAT EVALUATION QUADRUPLING IN A FIVE YEAR WINDOW. THAT'S A PROBLEM- SO I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT I KNOW THEY HAVE HAD SOME STUDIES DONE. WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING AT- AYE AYE THERE WERE SOME QUEUE ENEMIES WHO HAVE OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO MAYBE THEY'RE GETTING SELECTED ON A- MORE Q. AND MEET THEIR THEIR PART OF MORE Q. M. B. PANELS. AND BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE. PANELS THERE AND NOT NECESSARILY AVAILABLE BECAUSE IF THEY GET SELECT FOR MY CASE OF MICHELLE'S CASE AND MS RUBIO CASE IT'S LIKE I CAN'T DO. I CAN ONLY DO ONE. WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS SO THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO GO BACK FOR A REPLACEMENT PANEL. AND THAT'S WHY WE DID ANALYSIS BY ZIP CODE WHICH IS THE WAY THAT IDENTIFY THE KEY MEETINGS. ES DETERMINE HAVE IS HAS THERE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF Q. AND FEES IS IT CONCENTRATED LIKE THEIR ARGUED. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IS NOT THE CASE BASED ON THE DATA WE LOOKED AT AND I NEED TO LOOK AT MY NOTES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET IT WRONG- BUT WE HAD OUR I. T. FOLKS. NEAR THE OKAY LET'S SEE DID DID. THE DECREASE IN AND THE NUMBER OF Q. AMIS RIGHT AS I SAID QUADRUPLED THE DATA SHOWS THAT CASES REQUIRE REPLACEMENT POUNDS DO AVAILABLE Q. M. E. NEARLY HALF THE TIME THE CASE IS DELAYED BY TWO MONTHS- AND THEN WE DID THE ANALYSIS BY ZIP CODE I CAN'T FIND IT IN MY NOTES RIGHT NOW BUT- BUT THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS THAT WE DID THAT SAID. THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF Q. ENEMIES THAT THERE BEING A PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCENTRATION OF THE QUEUE ARMIES ARE IN CALIFORNIA SO BUT AND I'VE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE STUDIES THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STUDIES DONE YOU'LL ALSO IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR RESPONSE THERE WERE WERE WILLING TO STE TO STUDY THE- THE DECLINE WERE WILLING TO STUDY THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH STE WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF STUDIES DONE I THINK WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THE DIVISION NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A LAN TO ADDRESS THE MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE AS YOUR LEGISLATION DOES. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY GOT TO BE A PROBLEM IF THAT HASN'T BEEN RECENT THIRTEEN YOU JUST ST STE PI IT WOULD GO UP OVER TWO HUNDRED DOCTORS. BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEKING IS. THE USE OF DATA TO IDENTIFY WHAT SPECIALTIES ARE DECLINING. WHAT AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE WE REALLY STRUGGLING AND HAVING. MORE AND MORE REPLACEMENT PANELS JUST BEING STRATEGIC ABOUT. THE APPROACH IN. IN ART RECRUITING Q. AND NEEDS TO BE IN THE SYSTEM THEY HAD REACHED OUT TO SOME PHYSICIANS IN. MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND MEDICAL GROUPS AND SOME OF THE MEDICAL GROUPS ARE RELUCTANT TO LET THEIR PHYSICIANS. IN FAIRNESS TO THE DIVISION THEY HAVE TRIED THEY REACHED OUT WELL WE'RE SUGGESTING CONTINUE TO DO THAT. ARE AND THIS IS RIGHT ABOUT THE NEEDS WELL I THINK IT'S FOR SPECIALTIES BUT ALSO FOR ANY TYPE OF PHYSICIAN BECAUSE THOSE MEDICAL GROUPS ARE MEN. WANT THEIR PHYSICIANS TO BE TREATING. THEIR PATIENTS NOT NECESSARILY TAKING TIME AWAY TO CONDUCT THESE EVALUATIONS. SO RECOMMENDATION IS. BY TWENTY APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WE ALWAYS DOING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS NOW DEVELOPING A PLAN INCREASE THE NUMBER. ACTIVELY RECRUIT. YOUR TIE SPECIALTIES WITH THE GREATEST SHORTAGES YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION START THERE- AND AN ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. NOT CONTINUE NEGOTIATING WITH MEDICAL GROUPS AS BEST YOU CAN AND ESTABLISH GOALS TRACK HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SEEING EVIDENCE OF THAT BE THE DIVISION BEING MORE AND MORE PROACTIVE- EVEN THOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A DECLINE. THEY'RE SUGGESTING THERE'S NO SHORTAGE AND AM I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH WITH THAT ASSERTION I MEAN THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THEIR OPINION- WITH RESPECT TO- THAT SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES WE HAVE IN THE REPORT AS FAR AS THE DUE PROCESS ISSUES. I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY GO OVER THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT WE DISCUSS- AND WE ASK THEM FOR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR DISCIPLINARY PROCESS AND IN OUR- IN OUR- FIX PACKAGE THAT'S JUST THE- THE AN ABBREVIATED VERSION I MEAN THERE'S A POLITE LENGTHY TO. THE GATE DESPITE PROCESS THAT THEY FOLLOW WHEN WE ASK NUMBER POLICIES PROCEED THEY GAVE US A FLOW CHART. THAT STAFFER SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THEY NEED TO HAVE MORE SPECIFIC. SEASON PROCEDURE FOR THE VESTED IN. FACT VERSES THE REQUIREMENTS I NEED TO KEEP SEPARATE THEY THEY HAVE FLAYED. SECULAR SO THERE WAS NO REGULATION OUTLINING WHAT PROCESS. NO WE DIDN'T SEE SPECIFIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR STAFF TO FOLLOW OF TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT THEY SHOULD FOLLOW BUT THE TWO BUT TO BE CLEAR YOU SAID THAT THEIR SPECIFIC LAW THAT REQUIRES THAT. IS THAT CORRECT. WELL THERE THERE ARE SPECIFIC LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING WHAT THEIR INVESTIGATIVE AND REGULAR OUR OUR DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. THE AND THE RE APPOINTMENT I MEAN IT REALLY TIES TO AND OUR ATTORNEYS IN THE AUDIENCE YOU CAN ASSIST IF NECESSARY BUT- WE'RE NOT SAYING DUE PROCESS IT IT MAY AFFECT DUE PROCESS BECAUSE- IN SOME CASES. IT WASN'T A PROBLEM WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE Q. M. Q. ENEMIES IN THERE. THE ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLATIONS THE PROCESS WORKED WE SAW SOME AND THE MOST EGREGIOUS ONE. THAT I SAW WAS THE ONE I ILLUSTRATED WHERE THE ALLEGATION COMES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THEY WAIT UNTIL YOU KNOW ALL ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER. TO DENY THE REAPPOINTMENT OF THAT PARTICULAR Q. AND ME RATHER THAN ALLOWING. THE CASTIGATE OF DISCIPLINARY PROCESS TO PLAY ITSELF OUT ALLOW THE QUEUE IMMEDIATE CONTINUE TO. TO PERFORM SERVICES AND FULLY RESOLVE THAT SITUATION THE ALLEGATION WAS SUBSTANTIATED NOT. IT WAS NOT. THE AND- WOULDN'T HAVE THE ISSUE OF. FIFTEEN MONTHS LATER IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT HURTS THAT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL BUT IT ALSO HURTS THE WORKERS WHO COULD HAVE. RECEIVE SERVICES FROM THAT PARTICULAR EVALUATOR SO GREAT WE REALLY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT SO. ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DIVISION SUGGEST THAT THEY THEY GET THESE PLANS TOGETHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AT CETERA. QUESTIONS WHAT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE NEXT PANEL. SO WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO WITH US AND ROTH SINCE SINGER MORE LOCKED INTO ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW I HAVE- I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS CERTAINLY WE NEED TO PAY PEOPLE APPROPRIATELY FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE IT'S OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM OBVIOUS IT'S PROBLEM HERE IN WORKERS COMP JUST AS IT IS WITH MEDI CAL ON A FEW OF THE OTHER IS WHERE. PROVIDERS PROVIDE SERVICES TO OTHERS. I'M JUST WONDERING IF THIS. SO CALLED SHORTAGE ISSUE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF Q. MAYES AS PART OF A LARGER ISSUE YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY FOR THE- NOW GOING ON EIGHT YEARS THAT I'VE- I'VE BEEN UP HERE. AND THAT IS THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS OVERALL IN THE STATE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. TOOK A LOOK AT THAT I MEAN THE STATISTICS THAT NOBODY SEEMS TO DISPUTE IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT. OVER EIGHT THOUSAND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND SIMILAR STATISTICS FOR SPECIALTY. PRACTICE AREAS ORTHOPEDIC SOME OF THE ONES THAT WE SEE MOST COMMONLY IN THE WORKERS COMPARABLE- WE ALSO HAVE A TREND IN. THE HEALTH CARE PRACTICE FOR INDIES AND DO IS IN THE LIKE WHERE. THE SOLO PRACTICE POSITION WITH THE CRINKLED LEATHER BAG THAT WOULD COME FOR HOUSE CALLS IS RAPIDLY BECOMING AS EXTINCT AS THE DINOSAUR. DUE TO THE COST OF PRACTICE MALPRACTICE COVERAGE COSTS OF FACILITY OF OFFICE OPERATIONS ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS IN ALL OF THE REST. ALL MIGRATING TO THESE MULTI SPECIALTY PRACTICE GROUPS. WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN CONTRACTS WHICH EMPLOY PHYSICIANS WHICH CONTROL PHYSICIANS IN AND WORK HOURS IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THEY HAVE TO SEE EVERY DAY. AND Q. IN THESE ARE NOT TREATING. PHYSICIANS THERE LARGELY REPORT EVALUATION AND SOME. PATIENT EXAMINATION WERE NECESSARY SO DID YOU. IN THE IN COMING UP WITH YOUR CONCLUSIONS NOT THE GENERAL NOT THE SPECIFIC ONES WITH RESPECT TO RATE TO RATE EVALUATION AND DUE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS BUT THE GENERAL CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHAT. DID YOU SEE DID- OR HASN'T DONE DID YOU CONSIDER THE OVERALL STATE OF THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA AND THE REASONS FOR THAT. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE IN THE REPORT SENATOR WE ACTUALLY- REFERENCE TO A UC STUDY THAT TALKS ABOUT- PHYSICIANS THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY INCREASING HOWEVER THE NUMBER BEING- NOT NEARLY ENOUGH BASED ON OUR OVERALL POPULATION- SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT WE DIDN'T GO INTO DOING US A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS VERSUS SPECIALIST AT CETERA SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS A CHALLENGE THAT THE DIVISION CERTAINLY FACES ARE IN IDENTIFYING Q. AMIS BECAUSE THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA AND- THAT CERTAINLY- WILL LEND ITSELF TO A SITUATION IN IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA WHERE. THERE THERE- IF THERE'S A TICK THERE ISN'T A DECLINE IN NUMBER PHYSICIANS AND IN CALIFORNIA BUT CERTAIN SPECIALTIES ABSOLUTELY THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE- AND WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT- THAT THE DATA THAT THE DIVISION HAS THAT IT CAN USE. TO TRY TO IDENTIFY WHICH SPECIAL LEASE ORTHOPEDICS ABSOLUTELY AS ONE THERE ARE SOME OTHERS THAT THAT WE ANECDOTALLY MENTION BASED ON THEIR DATA SO WE DIDN'T GO INTO A BIG OVERALL DETAILED ANALYSIS. OF THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS IN CALIFORNIA THE SUPPLY OF SPECIALISTS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW THAT WOULD TIED TO THIS PARTICULAR- WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR KILOMETERS- BUT WE DO WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE DIVISION FACES ONE OF THE COMMENTS IN THE DEED OF UC'S ROUTE RESPONSE WHICH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. PROVIDE A DETAILED RESPONSE TO. DATA AS OUTLINED BELOW SHOWS THAT ONLY 50% OF OUR CURRENT Q. IN THE PHYSICIANS ARE BEING ASSIGNED TO PANELS. AND THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME AND I PLAN TO AS CITY TO BE SEE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE NOTE THAT I WROTE IN THE IN THE MARGIN FOR ME IS WHY. DID YOU WILL LOOK AT THAT WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU ENCOUNTERED DURING YOUR AUDIT. WELL WE THAT WAS IN THEIR RESPONSE- SO I DON'T KNOW THAT IT CAME UP DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT BUT WHAT WE DO. SAY IN OUR COMMENTS TO THEIR RESPONSES THIS STUDY THEY THEY BASE THAT ON. IT LOOKED AT ABOUT A SIX MONTH WINDOW IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO WE FEEL THAT. THAT THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT. WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE FIVE YEAR WINDOW THAT WE LOOKED AT AND EVEN THAT STUDY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. IT WAS A SHORT TIME FRAME AND THAT PERCENTAGE COULD BE. GREATER OUT LOOKING AT A LONGER TIME FRAME IT'S A PROCESS ISSUE IF. BROUGH CHAIR- RIGHT THAT THEY NEED TO DEAL WITH I WAS JUST I'M JUST TRYING NOW I GET TO GROUND ZERO ON THIS AND OUT OF. BE SURE TO ASK THEM WHEN THEY'RE UP HERE. THIS WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU HAD A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MORE WITH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS WHEN CAN I GO FROM THE MICRO TO THE MACRO IN. OF THE WITH WITH YOUR PLEASURE I GUESS BUT- THAT THE MICRO IS ON THE Q. AMIS. HOW MANY ARE ACTIVE POSITIONS AND HOW MANY ARE RETIRED. NOW I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION CENTER I APOLOGIZE SELECT JUDGES WORK FOR. WHAT WOULD YOU CALL IT- NEVER TRADERS THE YOU KNOW THEY DO CONSULTING ARE BETTER REPUTATION ARBITRATIONS BUT I JUST WONDER IF THERE'S SOME YEAH POOL OF RETIRED- DOCTORS THAT WOULD WOULD WORK FOR Q. ENEMIES YEAH AND AGAIN I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY THE DIVISION WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. BUT IN WAY IN OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT MISS SAUNDERS- MENTIONED IS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE PLAN FOR RECRUITING IT'S ALSO USING INFORMATION AND PROJECTING- AND IT AND LOOKING AT THE MIX OF TWO ARMIES ARE VAST MAJORITY KIMI'S RETIRED POSITION SO EVEN THOUGH A PHYSICIAN DECIDES TO RETIRE DOESN'T WANT. TO SEE PATIENTS ANYMORE IS HAVE AN INTERVIEW WE SHOULD RECRUIT POTENTIALLY BE A U. M. B. FOR A CALIFORNIA SO I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION HOPEFULLY THE DIVISION DOES. IF NOT THAT ONLY A SUGGESTION THAT THEY SHOULD. INCLUDE IN THEIR PLAN WHEN THEY LOOK AT PROJECTION. LET'S SEE HOW MANY. HOW PHYSICIANS ARE WHO ARE RETIRED ARE WILLING OR ARE HAVE CONSIDERED BECOMING A CUE I MEET PARTICULARLY IF THE MEDICAL THE SCHEDULES INCREASED. ECONOMIST MISS HOW YOU'VE BEEN. BUSY IN THIS AREA OF WORKERS COMPENSATION THIS YEAR SO I WANT TO. KIND OF LOOK AT THE OVERVIEW IN THE INTEGRATION SO. IF I COULD STEP BACK FROM THIS AUDIT- AND LOOK AT THE OTHERS THAT YOU'VE DONE- YOU'VE DONE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. SUBTITLE EMPLOYEES AND INMATES JOURNAL RECEIVED NECESSARY MEDICAL CARE FOR WORK RELATED INJURIES WITHIN. REASONABLE TIME FRAMES THAT WAS IN JULY. HE DID THE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE AUDIT FOR ME WHICH I APPRECIATE SOME STATE AGENCIES ARE PAYING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE THAN NECESSARY. TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE ROUTE WE GOT TO LEARN THAT THERE IS A- A MASTER AGREEMENT RIGHT AND THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENTS PURCHASING. WORKERS COMP INSURANCE FROM THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND. AND WE'VE GOT THIS ONE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AND WE JUST HAD THE LA TIMES COME OUT AND SAY THAT THE STATE WORKERS COMPENSATION OR COMPETITION TURNS FUND IS. PAYING MASSIVE SALARIES AND THERE'S NEPOTISM AND THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS LITTLE SPACE OF WORKERS COMP IN. AND MY CONCERN IS. HOW WAS IT ALL INTEGRATED IS THIS CAL H. R. MONITORING ALL OF THE STATE'S DEPARTMENTS DO WE HAVE THIS ORG CHART. WHERE WE NEED IT BECAUSE OUR FOR WORKERS COMP OR- IS IT THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID OVERSEAS. WORKERS COMP FOR ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THAT I'M AARE OF- SO I'M JUST WONDERING YOU KNOW I I'M GOING BACK TO MY COUNTY DAYS YOU KNOW CENTRALIZED VERSES DECENTRALIZED AND SO I'M LOOKING AT THE BIGGER PICTURE. OF YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU'VE STE Q. AND YOU HAD MISS SAUNDERS WORK IN ONE AREA ANDI'VE GOT THE NAMES OF THE OTHERS AND OTHER ARTISTS YOU'VE DONE BUTTON. YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A- MAYBE THERE'S A BIGGER ANSWER THAT WE'VE GOT A- PURSUE AND I'M JUST. IF YOU COULD GIVE ME THAT NOW GET. OF ADVICE. WELL. ANOTHER TIES INTO YOUR HOUSE RIGHT THERE OUGHT WILL YA LOOK AT IT YEAH YOU KNOW YOU ASKED FOR NOT IT. RIGHT MISS RUBIO ASTRONAUT AND IT ADDED IN HERE AT ALL IS SITTING HERE IT'S YOU NOW HAVE THIS CHANCE TO JUST LOOK AT ALL AND HOW DOES IT ALL IN A GREAT HOW DO WE REALLY CLEAN THE BEST. PRACTICES THE- WELL AND I THINK THAT WHAT THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE AGENCY THAT THE I. R. AS UNDER THAT'S THAT'S THE UMBRELLA. AND SEE THAT OF COURSE REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR SO. THAT AGENCY I THINK WOULD HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY CERTAINLY THE DEPARTMENT- HAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY BASED ON ON THE WORK WE DID HERE AND WORK WE DID FOR MS RUBY ON THE OTHER AUDIT CCRI IT. CERTAINLY THE- WE DID FOR YOU I THINK ON YOUR BUT IF I RECALL. THAT MASTER AGREEMENT CAL HR WOULD BE AND THAT AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF THESE DEPARTMENTS. ARE DEEP IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WE SUGGESTED IN YOUR IN YOUR IN THE REPORT WE PRODUCED. BASED ON YOUR REQUEST WHERE. GOTTA DO THAT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS% IT IS IT SMARTER FOR US TO. TO BE PART OF THE MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT OR TO BE PAYING PREMIUMS- ARE YOU KNOW AND THAT MONTHLY OR ANNUAL BASIS SO. I WOULD START WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE AGENCY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO AND THEY HAVE TO RESPOND TO ALL OF OUR REPORTS SO I WOULD PRESUME. AS MANY- ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE DONE THAT THEIR AGENCY SECRETARY AND STAFF WITHIN THAT. THAT AGENCY ARE LOOKING AT THE CROSS CUTTING ISSUES THAT THE STATE THERE'S A C. L. A. R. WERE WHOEVER. HAS DONE- AND- COMPILING ALL OF THEM TO SEE. HOW WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO AS A AS AN AGENCY AND THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO THAT'S WHERE I WOULD START. WELL IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DATA YOU'VE COMPILED. SHOULD HAVE BEEN. TO A DEPARTMENT HEAD OR A SECRETARY OR SOMEONE- AND THIS IS A TREND THAT'S NOT JUST NEW THIS IS OVER MULTIPLE YEARS. AND I'M JUST KIND OF WONDERING. WHO DO I GO TO AND SAY WAIT A SECOND WHITE WHY HAVE YOU NOT. INSTITUTED. SOME INITIATIVES TO TURN THIS CHART AROUND IN IN AND THE TREND AROUND- IN SEOUL COMING FROM COUNTY LAND I'M I'M TRYING TO SHOWCASE THE STATUS SO MASSIVE IN YOUR CART MUST BE SO BIG BUT- GOOD NIGHT YOU KNOW. WE'RE PAYING YOU GOOD SALARIES YOU SHOULD BE SEEING. YOU KNOW THE TRENDS AND YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE DUMP WAIT FOR AN AUDIT TO COME ALONG TO TELL YOU NOW I SPENT SOME TIME AND I SAT DOWN WITH THIS THE STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE MASTER AGREEMENT IS SORT OF AN OPEN ENDED PROGRAM WHICH THE AUDIT DID TOUCH BUT THERE MIGHT BE LIKE SEVEN BILLION IN LIABILITIES. THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AND FACTOR RAN FOR CASES THAT ARE. BEING SORT OF PAGE YOU GO BECAUSE THAT'S WHY THE PREMIUM OR THE COST IS LOWER RATES COULD BE HIGHER OVER TIME SO I GUESS I KIND OF FOUND THAT MAYBE I HAVE TO ASK AGAIN. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR SERVICES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET A TEAM. THAT'S LOOKING AT THAT THE WHOLE WORK COMP PROGRAM FOR THE STATE AS A WHOLE TO GETS FROM. SHION SEASON. OWES SURE I DON'T KNOW IT GOES YEAH IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU TRY TO. LEGISLATE OUR ARMS AROUND THE ENTIRE ISSUE BUT YES A LONGER DISCUSSION DEFINITELY BUT WE'RE WE'RE LEGISLATORS WERE NO LONGER EXECUTIVE SO IT'S IT THE ALL I GET IS A FIVE MINUTES TO ASK QUESTIONS AT A- AT A HEARING. AND BUT- TAKE TEN- WELL YOU KNOW. IN A ROUGH WE'RE JUST WE'RE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW. MOVE WHEN WE'RE DONE. WE WANT TO LEAVE THE PLACE A LITTLE BETTER SHAPE CRACK KINDA HOPING. THAT THERE'S SOME PROACTIVE INITIATIVE TAKEN. BY OUR STAFF MEMBERS AND THEIR MANAGERS AND THEIR SECRETARIES AND THE GOVERNOR. TO GET THAT DONE YEAH AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU LEGISLATE THAT BUT- IF THERE IS SOME WAY- MAYBE WE NEED TO. LOOK AT THE ORG CHART YEAH LOOK AT THAT. YOU KNOW WHO IS WHO WHO OF WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOP. FOR THE GRAY HUE HANK YOU. RIGHT WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER VOEPEL AND WE'RE NOW AT OUR FOR THIS FIRST PANEL WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR THE SECOND PANEL. YOU'RE BUYING DINNER RIGHT. UNDERSTOOD THIS ROLE PLACE SO MISTER CHAIR I SPENT. THIRTY NINE YEARS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS I HOLD I THINK AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT INSURANCE LICENSE. AND I'M NOT A WORKERS COMP EXPERT WHO WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. AND MY MENTALITY HERE IS TO SERVE AS YOUR INSURANCE BROKER WHICH I DID FOR THIRTY NINE YEARS OF VISINE MY CLIENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING FROM. FIRST OF ALL. AUDITOR'S SPOT ON. AND. LET ME GO THROUGH INSURANCE ONE A ONE AND THEY GO TO MY QUESTIONS IF YOU LOSE IT INDULGE ME. SO I WAS GUEST WANED. WORKERS COMP. TO MY CLIENTS AS A BURRITO. WHO EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS A BURRITO RIGHT SO. ONE END OF THE BREED- IS PREMIUM HOW MUCH THE EMPLOYERS PAY. THE OTHER END OF THE BREED IS BENEFITS. WHAT BENEFITS TO THE WORKERS GET NOW ALL OF US WANT TO TAKE CARE OF. THE WORKERS. WITHOUT BANKRUPTING THE EMPLOYER OKAY WE'RE ALL THEIR- WE ALL AGREE. NOW THAT'S WHERE OF THE TRICK COMES SAID. YOU SQUEEZE ONE END OF THE BREED- THAT'S THE EMPLOYER'S PREMIUM. AND THE BENEFITS POP OUT. BETTER BENEFITS FOR WORKERS THERE BY GET SET BUT- IF THE EMPLOYER IS GRIPING. THEN YOU SQUEEZE THE OTHER END OF THE BREED IN A BENEFITS TIGHTEN UP. NOW. HOW TO TIGHTEN UP THE BENEFITS. YOU DON'T DENY HIM. YOU DELAY THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE I BELIEVE SIR. YEAH WE'RE BY LATE MORNING NUMBER AND THEY- ARE INCREASES CAN THE OTHER WAY YOU. BASICALLY DENY BENEFITS IS TO SQUEEZE THE Q. AMIS. WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEX SO THAT. ALLEVIATES THAT. SO. WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IN I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT RELATIVELY. PURE. I'M AN OLD GUY I SAW THE STATE FUND COME INTO THE WORKERS COMP MARKET IN NINETEEN EIGHTIES NAY TOOK OVER 60% OF THE WORKERS COMP MARKET OKAY AND THEY GOT BURKE THEY GOT BIRD BAD. THEY COULDN'T MAKE. THEY'RE BRE REAL. EITHER RAN IN SEOUL THROUGH THE YEARS. THE STATE FUND HAS WITHDRAWN FROM THE MARKET QUIETLY ON NO. SO. WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS IS. STATE FUN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER JUST APPROVED A TEN POINT 3% REDUCTION IN THE ADVISORY. PREMIUM RATES. IS EVERYONE AWARE THAT AND CHECK IT OUT YOU CAN GOOGLE IT. THAT'S MY LATEST INFORMATION FROM THE INDUSTRY COULD BE WRONG DON'T KNOW. BUT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS A CHECK THAT OUT. NOW ACCORDING TO MY. CLAN STEIN INFORMATION IN THE INDUSTRY WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE ACCURATE BECAUSE- US INSURANCE BROKERS ARE ALL CONNECTED. IT'S INTERESTING TO ME THAT BURKE HATHAWAY SURPASSED STATE FUND AS LARGEST WORKERS COMP UNDERWRITER WHO. SO WE REDUCE THE PURE INSURANCE RATE. IN A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY COMES SWOOPING IN. COULD THERE BE PROFIT. THAT'S SOMETHING FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT AND I'M NOT MAKING ANY ACQUISITIONS I DON'T KNOW THIS IS RUMOR IT'S JUST. STUFF THAT'S ALL THROWN OFF THE REAR OF THE TRANSOM OF THE BOAT. COULD BE WRONG BY COULD ABSOLUTELY BE WRONG. AND IF YOU'RE MESSING MY BIRTH. YOU KNOW BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. THAT'S A BIG DEAL. SO I'M JUST SIMPLY REPORTING. IS IN THE TRENCHES INSURANCE REPORT COULD BE RIGHT COULD BE WRONG. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO. THAT'S WHERE YOU COME. SO WHAT'S INTERESTING IS ON. THE STATE FUN NOW HAS GONE FROM 506070% IN THE PAST A FIFTEEN POINT 6% OF THE WORKER'S COMP MARKET. OKAY NOW THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOOD OR BAD I DON'T KNOW. BUT. THERE ARE OTHER FORCES AT WORK IN THE INSURANCE MARKET THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT BE. SURE OF. M. I TRULY BELIEVE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS- REDUCTION OF TEN POINT 3% TO CONFIRM THAT OR DENY IT. SO MORE QUESTIONS THAT'S BASICALLY. WHAT I HAVE TO REPORT SIR AS YOUR INSURANCE BROKER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL- WITHTHE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU THING RESERVATION AND GO TO MOVE TO THE SECOND PANEL. THE SERVER COMMENTS IN RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WE HAVE- MISTER DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION- MISTER RAYMOND. MEISTER EXECUTIVE MEDICAL DIRECTOR DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION SO THE CHEN ITEM NUMBER THREE. GERMAN THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND LET ME JUST ASK THE MEMBERS- ON THE DíAS IF WE CAN MAYBE HOLDER QUESTIONS SO AFTER THEY PRESENT. MAYBE WE COULD. USE OUR TIME MORE EFFICIENTLY THIS WAY. SO PLEASE FIGURE THAT INTRODUCE YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD AND- PLEASE BEGIN TO BELIEVE YOU HAVE A OPENING STATEMENT GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GEORGE KERR SAID ON ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. AND I'M JOINED BY DOCTOR RAYMOND MEISTER WHOSE EXECUTIVE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO YOU- THE MISSION OF OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN THIS STATE. IS TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA INJURED AT WORK RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE FOR WORK RELATED INJURIES IN THE DISPUTES ARE ADDRESSED AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE. QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATOR PROGRAM DOES PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN THE FUNCTIONING OF OUR STATE SYSTEM. IT RESOLVES MEDICAL LEGAL DISPUTES. SEVERAL THE RECENT WORKERS COMPENSATION REFORMS OF SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THE KEY WITH ME PROGRAM AND MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE STREAMLINED THE MOST RECENT WAS ADDRESSED THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE REFORMS BY SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE. THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION COMMUNITY EMPLOYERS LABOR PROVIDERS AND CARRIERS HAVE STUDIED VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE QUEUE IN THE SYSTEM FOR OVER TWO DECADES TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT IT ADEQUATE. THE IT IS ARTICLE YOU WORKING TO HELP. EFFICIENTLY ADDRESS DISPUTES ABOUT THE SYSTEM. THIS IS AN ONGOING EFFORT AND OUR FOCUS IS NOW SHIFTED TO ADDRESS THE CURRENT CHALLENGES. DO THIS IN THE AUDITOR'S IDENTIFIED THREE MAJOR ISSUES WITH OUR CURRENT PROGRAM ONE THE NUMBER OF Q. AND HE'S IN OUR SYSTEM IN THE DECREASE. CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIVISIONS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES REGARDING THE REAPPOINTMENT OF Q. AMIS AND THE DISCIPLINE OF Q. AMIS. AND THEN THIRD ENSURING THE ADEQUACY IS OF THIS REPORT OF THE OF THE ADEQUACY OF QB REPORTS. NO AS SEEN WE WILL TAKE ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR AND PUT THEM INTO PLACE AS RECOMMENDED. WE WANT TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THAT IN THE W. C. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS EMPLOYERS AND PROVIDERS. OF TO WORK ON IMPLEMENTINGTHE STATE AUTUMN REAL AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD MEETINGS WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON OCTOBER EIGHTEENTH THIS WAS BEFORE THE AUDIT FINDINGS CAME OUT NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND DECEMBER SIX. AND WE HAVE A SCHEDULED MEETING FOR THIS FRIDAY JANUARY THE TENTH. IN THE PROCESS OF HOLDING OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT HAVE EMERGED IN ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN THE MEETINGS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ENTIRE CUBAN THE PROCESS. OF ITS BE DIFFICULT TO WILL LOOK AT ONE ASPECT OF IT NOT REALIZE THEIR OUT TAKES OF IT ARE BEING AFFECTED IT SEEMS OUR PROCESS WE WANT TO LOOK AT. TRY TO MAKE PROFICIENT. ISSUES OF QUALITY. IT FOR QUALITY ANGEL TO THE LET ME PROCESS HAVE BEEN THIS OF SEPARATE BROUGHT OUT SECTIONS OF THE STATE. WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND REACH A. RESOLUTION SOME OF THE- BEST. WAY THE. CPAS X. ARE LEGALLY HE'S GOT. ONE GOING MEETINGS ARE SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT A FEE SCHEDULE THAT IS FAIR TO PROVIDERS AND OPERATES TO REDUCE FRICTIONAL COSTS AND STEM ABUSES WERE UNCHECKED INCREASES IN MEDICAL LEGAL COSTS IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. IT IS TRUE THIS IS THIS TO ME FEE SCHEDULE HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HAVE HAD STUDIES TO LOOK AT IT AND THEY'LL STUDIES HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE FEES ARE REASONABLE. NOW I WOULD TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT WE PUT THE STUDIES DECIDED THAT WE REACH AN AGREEMENT AS TO WHAT IS A FAIR AMOUNT. FOR A MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATION WE ALSO NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT IS A QUALITY MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATION. AND IN THAT REGARD PLEASE KNOW MY STORY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AND DETERMINE WHETHER REPORT IS ADEQUATE OR NOT- THAT WE HAVE AN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM WE HAVE A COURT SYSTEM TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE BELIEVE. WE HOPE TO IMPLEMENT A MANDATE TO REVIEW AND UPDATE THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE EVERY TWO YEARS AND DEVELOP A STANDARD TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE INCREASES THAT IS TIED TO OBJECTIVE. AND OBJECTIVE INDEPENDENT STANDARD FOR REASONABLE ADJUSTMENT TO MEDICAL LEGAL COSTS WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE WORK THE DOCTORS ARE DOING AT THAT THAT WORK INCREASES THEN THE FEE SCHEDULE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE INCREASED. ANY INCREASES MIGHT BE TIED TO MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEXES LIKE THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE. OF TYING IT TO INFLATION CERTAINLY AN OPTION BUT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE ARE MID LEGAL FEES ARE- OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE IS TIED TO MEDICARE INCREASES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO OTHER OPTIONS ALL OPTIONS REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKED OUT. THIS PLANNED ACTIVITY WILL ALSO SERVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RESULTS OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES COMMISSION TO ENSURE EVIDENCE BASED UPDATES TO OUR MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE. IN TERMS OF RECRUITING ADDITIONAL- Q. EMMYS WE ARE LOOKING AT HAS TO HOW TO ADDRESS THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO RECRUIT MORE Q. M. IS IN OUR SYSTEM. WE ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT TARGETING ONE PHYSICIANS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE CUE IN THE EXAMINATION AND PASSED AND DID NOT BECOME A Q. ME AND WE TAKE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. PHYSICIANS THAT WORK Q. AMISOM LET THE SYSTEM AN ENQUIRING INTO MORE DETAIL AS TO WHY THE LEFT AND SEEING IF WE CAN RECRUIT THEM BACK. pPHYSICIANS IT TAKEN THE QUEUE IN THE EXAM AND HAVE NOT PASSED THROUGH EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH WE WANT TO HAVE CONTINUED MEETINGS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND MAJOR MEDICAL GROUPS. NO THIS GROUP THAT DID NOT WANT THEIR PHYSICIANS TO BECOME . ENEMIES WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER IS BENEFICIAL FOR THE DIVISION TO CONTRACT WITH A VENDOR TO CREATE A SPECIALIZED MARKETING PLAN TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS IF WE NEED EXPERTISE MARKETING WE NEED TO SHUT WE NEED TO GO OUT AND GET THAT. WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A NEW FEE SCHEDULE IN PLACE PRIOR TO MAKING ANY OFFICIAL RECRUITMENT EFFORTS BUT DESPITE THIS WE ARE IN THE PLANNING STAGES AND WE ARE ASSESSING WHAT RESOURCES WE HAVE TO FILL THIS AUDIT REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S THE LEGALIZATION QB'S CURRENT AT THE HOW. Q. A- DAY BASIS UTILIZED STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ABOUT FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY PERCENT. A PANEL REQUESTS ARE GIVEN 210% OF Q. AND MEANS. THE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE PLACED RESTRICTIONS ON THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS ACU NY COULD LIST. THERE WAS ALL TOP LIMIT OF TEN. AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THIS WOULD REDUCE HIGH VOLUME Q. AMIS WITH LARGE NUMBER OF OFFICE LOCATIONS. AND WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE DOCTORS TWO REGISTERS ACU ME BUT WE DID NOT SEE THIS OF FACT. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE ALSO IMPLEMENTED INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW. THIS WAS EXPECTED TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF Q. ANY REQUEST BECAUSE Q. AMIS WOULD BE NO LONGER ALLOWED. TO EAT WOULD NO LONGER BE UTILIZED TO RESOLVE TREATMENT DISPUTES. WHILE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN THE SYSTEM OF REMAIN STEADY THE NUMBER OF PANEL REQUESTS HAVE INCREASED WHICH LEADS ONE. TO WONDER WHAT IS CAUSING THIS INCREASE IN PANEL REQUESTS. WE ARE GOING TO REQUEST THE COMMISSION ON HEALTH AND SAFETY WORKERS COMPENSATION ANALYZE AND RESEARCH THIS ISSUE. RELATED TO AN UNAVAILABILITY UNAVAILABILITY UNAVAILABILITY EXCUSE ME OF ACUTE MAY HAVE BEEN REYES AND ARE OF A CONCERN TO US. WE ARE EXAMINING OUR ALGORITHM IN THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR Q. AND MEANS WE HAVE AN ONLINE PANEL FOR Q. ENEMIES. OF THOSE Q. ARMIES ARE SIGNED BY RANDOM SELECTION TO THROUGH THROUGH OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ASCERTAIN WHY SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF AVAILABLE Q. IN THESE ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED IN OUR SYSTEM. WILL TAKE WHATEVER STEPS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THIS UNTAPPED YOU IN THE RESOURCE IS INTEGRATED INTO THE EVALUATION PROCESS. OUR STAKE HOLDERS ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE ENTIRE Q. ANY PROCESS WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING TIMELY REPORTS. ELIMINATING DELAYS AND EVALUATIONS ENSURING THE UNDER UTILIZATION OF THE CHARACTER CURRENT Q. ANY PROP- POPULATION. THE PARTICIPANTS ARE ALSO EXPLORING IN DISCUSSING WAYS TO FACILITATE. YOU ANY REMOVING THEMSELVES FROM THE DATABASE WHEN THEY ARE FULLY BOOKED WITH APPOINTMENTS SO THAT YOU ANY WILL NOT BE PLACED ON ANY OUTGOING CAMELS. IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS STEP WILL DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SECOND PANEL REQUESTS. PARTICIPANTS ARE ALSO DISCUSSING INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF HOURS AND CONTENT OF P. Q. ANY EDUCATION IN ORDER TO ENSURE BETTER REPORT QUALITY. AS TO THE PROCESS THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE THERE'S CONSIDERATION OF HAVING AN OUTSIDE ENTITY COLLECT AND ORGANIZE MEDICAL RECORDS PRIOR TO THE SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS TO ACCUSE ME. TO SAVE THEM TIME AND ALLOW THEM TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THE EVALUATION ON EVALUATIONS AND LESS TIME ON CLERICAL WORK. FINALLY MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE EXPRESSING THEIR INTEREST IN INCREASING THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR MAKING THE QUEUE IN THE APPOINTMENT IN MAKING MORE TIME FOR THE SERVICE OF THE COMPLETED CURE ME REPORT ALL THESE MATTERS ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL HAVE CHANGES IN REGULATIONS THANK YOU AND THESE WILL BE MADE. AND THE AND THE TO ME PROCESS WILL BE CHANGED AS A RESULT. IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINE D. W. C. HAS AGREED TO UPDATE OF OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE RE APPOINTMENT AND DISCIPLINE PROCESS. AS TO REPORT QUALITY SEPARATE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ARE ONGOING DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF ADDRESSING QUALITY. THE RESULTS OF THESE MEETINGS INCLUDE AN AGREEMENT ON AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD FOR THE DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD QUALITY REPORT. MODELS FOR AUDITING QB REPORTS ARE BEING DISCUSSED THAT WOULD INCLUDE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ON COMMITTEES TO REVIEW REPORTS AND WHO SHOULD SERVE ON THESE COMMITTEES. WE ARE ALSO REVIEWING THE PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING AN ADEQUATE REPORTS EITHER THROUGH THE PART'S OR pPROVIDING FEEDBACK TO CUBA MEANS. DISCUSSIONS ARE ALSO TAKING PLACE ON WHETHER OR NOT THESE WC HAS THE RESOURCES THE ARCTIC TO ME REPORTS SOLELY WITH THE W. C. PERSONNEL. IS ANTICIPATED THE FORMAL STRUCTURE WE BUILD TO WILL BE DEVELOPED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REPORT. QUALITY ARTISTS FOR THE REPORT QUALITY ALL ITS DIVISIONS IN THE LABOR CODE YOU IN SHORT WE ARE TAKING ACTIVE STEPS TO REVIEW THE ENTIRE CUMAE PROCESS AND WE ARE IN THE FALL WE ARE INCLUDING THE COMMUNITY AND WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL PRODUCE POSITIVE RESULTS. AS I SAY WE ARE TAKING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE IN THE PAST AND I THINK WE ARE A PROCEEDING ON OF COURSE TO CORRECT. AND HOPEFULLY REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY AS TO WHERE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO GO. THANK YOU. OF THE DIGITAL TESTIMONY HERE NO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT. OKAY GREAT WELL THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE THE STATEMENT I KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS SO LET ME JUST ASK VERY GENERAL QUESTION BASED OFF THE AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION EARLIER WHERE SHE WAS SAYING THAT THE REQUEST FOR Q. AMIS'S INCREASED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. BUT THE NUMBER OF Q. AMIS'S DECREASED 12% RIGHT AND THEN WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE QUADRUPLING OF THE PANELS WHICH YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AS WELL- DO YOU AGREE WITH THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING OR WHAT WE'VE SEEN I AGREE WITH THE NUMBERS I MEAN THE NUMBER I THINK THE NUMBERS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES- BUT WE WANT TO DO IS TRY TO FIGURE OUT TO GET HOW DO WE WHY DO WE REACH A SOLUTION TO CREATE A MORE. EFFICIENT SYSTEM WITH SB EIGHT SIXTY AS I MENTIONED WE THOUGHT THE NUMBER REQUESTED GO DOWN TAKE AWAY THE SPECIFICS AND- WHAT IT MEANS DECIDED MOVES WERE TREATMENT DISPUTES AND YOU CAN LOOK AT OUR INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW NUMBERS TO SEE HOW THOSE NUMBERS OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE PLAYING UP THOSE NUMBERS ARE HIGH BUT INSTEAD. INSTEAD OF SEEING A DECREASE WE SAW AN INCREASE- AGAIN THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LITIGATION SYSTEM A LOT OF FRICTION BOB AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SYSTEM FIXES. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE ALL THE OBLIGATION ALL THE RULES THAT HAVE BEEN LAYERED OVER AND OVER AGAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION. THAT'S RIGHT PEEL BACK. YES THERE'S A BURRITO BUT- WE'RE DEALING ONION. HERE WE GOT A LOT OF LAYERS OF OBLIGATIONS OVER THE DECADE. WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE HOW DO WE CREATE A SIMPLER. MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM WITH LESS FRICTION BECAUSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE SPENT WORKERS COMPENSATION. GOES INTO THAT CATEGORY FRICTION. OF SO I SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT REALLY WHAT IS GOING ON IS THERE AN ADEQUATE NUMBER OF CUBAN THESE. I DON'T STE I WOULD SAY THERE IS I WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW. THERE COULD BE WE UNDER UTILIZED OUR Q. AMIS AND I THINK WORK WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK A THAT AS I SAY. THE ALGORITHMS THAT WE ASSIGN Q. AMIS NOW WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY Q. M. IS THAT ARE UNAVAILABLE GET ON THE PANEL AND YET WE HAVE SOME Q. AMIS. WHO DON'T GET ON A PANEL- I TALKED TO ONE PHYSICIAN WHO BECAME THE Q. M. E. AND HE DROPPED OUT AFTER A FEW YEARS BECAUSE HE JUST WASN'T GETTING ANY PANELS YOU KNOW AND THAT'S THAT'S- ON US NOT SOMETHING WE NEED TO RESOLVE. WE ARE LOOKING INTO THAT YEAH WITH THE pHEARD THAT DIRECTLY TO FROM SOME FOLKS ARE NOT EVEN. INVOLVED IN THE CAPITAL WORLD APPEARS ANECDOTALLY BACK HOME. TOLD ME THAT SAME EXACT RIDE AREA RIGHT I THOUGHT SO CUTS PROP. AND THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT'S ON US THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE GOING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH. THAT WHY APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IS TO. AND THE AUDITOR'S TO. GRILL DOWN TO WHAT ARE THINGSTHAT WE CAN FIX HOW WE MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. OKAY IN MY OPENING STATEMENTS I THINK THERE'S A WIN WIN HERE THAT CAN. DECREASE COSTS FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BUT- GET WORKERS TREATED FASTER AND HOPEFULLY BACK ON THE JOB A LOT SOONER. I AGREE AND WE ARE WE ARE TAKING STEPS IN THOSE DIRECTIONS YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR- OUR MEDICAL TREATMENT UTILIZATION SCHEDULED MOVING TO EVIDENCED BASED GUIDELINES. YOU KNOW WE ONE INJURED WORKERS TO GET TREATMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND WE FIND THAT WHEN THAT TREATMENTS PROVIDED EARLY ON THEN THAT THEY GET BACK TO WORK WHICH IS WHAT. EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE AND- AND SO YOU SAID YOU'RE UNSURE WHETHER WE NEED MORE Q. AND ME'S THE DAY BUT YOU DON'T DISPUTE THE DATA. SO CAN YOU JUST TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING TO REPAIRS. A RECRUIT. MORE QUALIFIED MEDICAL EVALUATORS. WELL AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO Q. TO DOCTOR. PER CUBIC METER DROPPED OUT OF THE SYSTEM I THINK WE NEED TO TALK. MEDIC TO MORE OF MEDICAL GROUPS LONG TERM MEDICAL GROUPS WE NEED TO TALK TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO SEE WHAT WE WHAT. WE CAN DO TO BRING THEM IN. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE. A LITTLE CREATIVE AS TO HOW WE CAN BRING IN. I CAN'T FORCE ANYBODY I CAN'T FORCE ANYBODY TO QUEUE UP TO BE A QUEUE IN THE I CAN AUTOMATICALLY. STAY THAT I CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER. WE CAN FIX OUR MEDICAL OUR MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE AND I. HAD A REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS. PROVIDERS EMPLOYERS ATTORNEYS TO WORK AND WORK IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT IF I INCREASED PIZZA DOESN'T MEAN I'M GOING TO GET MORE Q. ENEMIES AND WE SAW THAT TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN WE INCREASE THE FEE SCHEDULE. AND WE STILL SOFT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF KEEP IT MEANS. WE WILL CERTAIN WE WILL CERTAINLY. PUT IN THE EFFORT TO DO THAT WE WILL CERTAINLY REACH OUT TO GROUPS AND WE'LL- WE'LL HAVE. BETTER MORE SIMPLER FEE SCHEDULE FEE SCHEDULE IT'S MORE PREDICTABLE THAT EVERYBODY CAN UPSET. THE OTHER BY MULTIPLE FACTORS AGO. THAT BUT OBVIOUSLY THINKING CREASING. SCHEDULE MIGHT. ANSWER LIES OR CUBIES TO COME FORWARD. AND MAYBE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE SCENARIO THAT YOU BROUGHT UP WHERE. PEOPLE A QUAL. FI'S QB'S ARE GETTING THE REFERRALS WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF AN ALGORITHM. OUR OTHER FACT GET A FIGURE OUT HOW WE KEEP THEM IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE IF THEY'RE STILL. WE'RE STILL SEEING MORE THAN SIXTY DAY DELAYS PEOPLE AREN'T BEING SEEN WE GOT TO FIGURE THAT PROCESS OUT OF I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS. FROM THE PANEL EARLIER ACTUALLY KINDA STEMMING FROM AN SUBSTRING FIGURE OUT. HOW DO WE GET TO THAT POINT AND WHAT IS IT WE NEED TO GET DONE TO IT TO GET THERE. YOU TALKED ABOUT ADOPTING NEW- RULES AND REGULATIONS AND THEN ALSO THE FEE SCHEDULE. BUT I DIDN'T HEAR A TIME LINE IN ANY OF THAT YOU GIVE A- KIND OF WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AT THE DEPARTMENT AND KIND OF THE TIMELINE OF. WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE SOME OF THIS MOVING FORWARD WELL I WOULD LIKE OUR FOR OUR OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE MEETING RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT PROCESS DONE AND IN THE EARLY SPRING THAT WE WOULD MOVE AHEAD WITH REGULATIONS AT THAT POINT. NO SOME SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ARE SAYING DON'T MOVE TOO FAST. NO BECAUSE AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING OF A GLOBAL SOLUTION. ON SOME THINK THAT WE'RE NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO SEE WHERE OUR DISCUSSIONS GO AND WHAT AGREEMENT BEING REACHED I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT WE ARE ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT- BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S BEST. INTEREST IS THAT THAT WE FIX PROBLEM WE GET WE THINGS GOING FOR HER THIRD WORLD THAT. THAT THE THAT IN TERMS OF THE SCHEDULE WHAT I LIKE TO STAY IN A- TO. KNOW PUT THAT NUMBER IN REGULAR. CAN GET THROUGH FAST AS WE CAN. I'M AND THAT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE A PLAN FORD FOR LOOKING OUT FOR POOR QUALITY. I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN LOOKING AT REPORT ALREADY AND WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IT FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME AS FAR AS- WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE LOOKED BACK YOU KNOW I JUST. I JUST DON'T SEE THAT AS TO WHY WE HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THAT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- AND FRANKLY TO MEET FOR ME TO SIT HER AN OFFER EXCUSES WERE IS. IS MEANINGLESS I WANT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MOVE AHEAD CORRECT I THINK WE I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE- CURE ME YOU. DID SEE A RACE- WE RAISE THE WE RAISE THE FEE SCHEDULE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX- AND I THINK THAT WAS BASED ON SOME OF THE APPORTIONMENT. OF IF I IF I RECALL CORRECTLY SOME OF THE- APPORTIONMENT OF LAWS THAT WHEN INTO EFFECT WITH SB EIGHT NINETY NINE- WE REQUIRED MORE ABOUT. IT AS I SAY THAT WE HAD WE HAD STUDIES THE BRANCH CORPORATION OTHER PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT AND EVERY TIME WE'VE DONE BUT THEY'VE COME AGAINST. THE FEES OF MENIFEE LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE IS REASONABLE. COMMON FRANKLY WAS IN FULL ACTUALLY JUST THE YOU KNOW RECENTLY THAT I'VE HEARD THAT IT WAS NOT THEY HAVE THAT. THAT IT WAS WILL- SO. AND I THINK WHAT I'VE BEEN HERE SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION AND WHERE THEY SEE FEE SCHEDULES. UPDATE BOB FREQUENTLY THE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX SO YOU KNOW YOU LOOK AT OUT. IN HOT OFFICE POOL OF. MEDICAL. EQUIPMENT FEE SCHEDULE THE ALL THOSE HAVE BEEN. UPDATED. A LOT MORE PERIODICALLY AND- THE QUEUE ME SCHEDULE RIGHT ONE CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT WHAT WHAT'S OUR OFFICIAL MEDICAL. SCHEDULE WAS INVITED TO THE MEDICARE SSTEM. AND MEDICARE SYSTEM DOES THERE THOUGH IT DOES THERE A QUARTERLY ANNUAL UPDATES- THAT BUT THAT'S JUST BECOME A LOT MORE AUTOMATIC. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S MEDICAL TRIP THAT'S MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT'S AN EASIER. YOU KNOW SORT OF APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON WITH THEM WITH ARE MET LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE YOUKNOW THAT'S YOU. SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ENCOUNTER. BUT IT HAS A DEPARTMENT EVER TALKED ABOUT WITH. YOU KNOW WHEN MEDI CAL INCREASES FOR INSTANCE MAYBE INCREASING THE QB SCHEDULE AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE BECAUSE I MEAN WE HAVEN'T ADOPTED ANYTHING BUT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE- LOOKING AT- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WITH OUR UPDATING OF THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEES CONTROL- AS I SAID BEFORE I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH PERIODIC UPDATES I THINK WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- YOU KNOW WE TALKED OUR STAKEHOLDERS AN AGREED. UPON A REASONABLE OBJECTIVE STANDARD. GOD OKAY I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATIONS ON BOTH SIDES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A PATH FOR US TO GET TO YOU AND THEN- I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW KIND OF TIME LINE FOR THE DEPARTMENT THINKING IN TERMS OF ADOPTING THE SCHEDULES ARE ADOPTING REGULATIONS ARE WE- I KNOW YOU SAID YOU BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS BUT HOW MANY STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS WE HAVE BEFORE WE HAVE DECISIONS. OF THAT ARE I DON'T THINK I CAN I DON'T THINK I CAN REALLY SAY AS IF IT SAY SPECIFICALLY AS WELL AS AS WITH TIMELINE AS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I WOULD LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW I'M I WOULD HOPE I WOULD HOPE YOU KNOW WITH THIS WITH THAT WITH A NUMBER OF MEETINGS WITH ABOUT EARLY SPRING WE WOULD HAVE WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE THAT- THAT THAT WOULD BE MY HOPE YOU KNOW WEST AT EVERYTHING AT THE OF THE IT'S REQUIRED US TO YOU KNOW TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE. BY APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE'LL CERTAINLY WORK ON THAT HAVE A PLAN AND HAVE A PLAN AVAILABLE- AS TO OUR DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES WE WILL HAVE WRITTEN PROCEDURES- IN IT IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY- WE'VE MADE SOME GREAT STRIDES IN THAT REGARD I THINK A LOT OF THE TURNS. BY THE DAUGHTER. WE WILL BE HAPPY PLACE. RECEIVERS WE HAVE OUR POINT WE HAVE DISAPPEAR TRACKS. IT'S BUT WE WILL PUT THAT WE WILL PUT THAT IN WRITING AND WILL WE WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW THAT- NO NO NO ISSUE THERE US TO AS THE QUALITY WE WILL HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE IN THIS PROBABLY WILL BE PART OF REGULATIONS THAT WILL. ASK FOR RANDOM SAMPLING OF REPORTS FROM CUBA MEANS- WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT THEM AND THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHO WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THEM YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A YOU KNOW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON OUR STAFF YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST KIND OF THE NATURE OF NATURE TRYING TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS FOR STATES PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FOR STATE SERVICE. BUT YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY CERTAINLY WILLING TO STEP IN AND SAY LOOK LET'S FORM A COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT REPORT QUALITY THEN MAYBE THAT IS THE BEST PATH FORWARD THEY CAN LOOK AT REPORT QUALITY THEY CAN INDICATE WHAT'S LACKING WHAT'S GOOD AND THEN WE CAN GO OUT THREE EDUCATION- YOU KNOW THROUGH OUR TRAINING SYSTEM AND SAY LOOK. FOR A FEW ENEMIES YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS SPECIFIC AREA AND YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS CERTAIN SPECIFIC WAY HI MOM AGAIN I THINK YOU KNOW READ YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE THAT SOME OF THIS IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL YOU KNOW THERE'S LITIGATION GOING OFF AND THIS AND THAT THE STATE AUDITOR POINTED OUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REP THAT IN CASES ENOUGH REPRESENTED CASES. YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS ON THE ON REPRESENTED I'D REDUCE. THE REP SENATE SIDE. AND I THINK. I THINK. WE'LL MAKES IT WILL TAKE PROGRESS. IN AND OUT. GOT IT YEAH AND I'M JUST TO FIGURE OUT I KNOW FROM THE COMMITTEE HOW WERE USED. WHETHER IT'S A LEGISLATIVE FIXES IT. RESOURCES SOUNDS LIKE I'M HER FIGURE OUT WHY A THIRTEEN YEARS SCHEDULE HASN'T BEEN UPDATED. AND IT UP. YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT. HOW WE FIX IT. HOW DO WE GET THERE SO THAT. INJURED WORKERS CAN. GET BACK ON THE JOB. WELL ULTIMATELY WELL IN TERMS OF THE FEET IN TERMS OF THE FEE SCHEDULE I THINK OUR STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO TALK AND REACH. AND REACH AN AGREEMENT OR AT LEAST GET THE PARAMETERS AS TO WHAT. WHAT CONSTITUTES. REASONABLE PAYMENT FOR A MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATION. BUT TO GET TO THAT POINT I THINK YOU HAVE TO YOU HAVE TO GET ALSO WEOFFER ALSO ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS. A REASONABLE MEDICAL EVALUATION. KNOW WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE ISSUE THAT'S BEING DECIDED. HOW SHOULD IT BE BEST DECIDED WHAT SPECIALTY SHOULD. CANDOR SHOULD DECIDE THE ISSUE- I THINK ONCE THEY GET TO THAT. PEOPLE REALIZE WELL LOOK IF I GIVE FIVE IF I PAY X. AMOUNT I KNOW I'M GOING TO GET A GOOD QUALITY REPORT. AND THAT GOOD QUALITY COULD REPORT CAN RESOLVE THE CASE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PROCESS TO. YOU KNOW THE PANEL IS BEING REQUESTED- YOU KNOW AVAILABILITY OF Q. ENEMIES YOU KNOW EVERY TO HAVE ME ON THAT PANEL SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO WE WANT TO REACH A SOLUTION IN THAT REGARD. CERTAINLY YEAH I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE DO THAT LEGISLATIVELY OR WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IT INTERNALLY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. I HAVE LEGISLATION THAT KIND OF PUSHES TOWARDS. THAT GOAL BUT I'M. HER FIGURE HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET THERE. RIGHT YOU'RE SAYING WE HAVE THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND YOU KNOW IS NOTHING LIKE LEGISLATION TO FORCE DISCUSSION. RIGHT WE'VE SEEN THAT SINCE WE DROP THE BILL LAST YEAR. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MOVING THE DISCUSSIONS NOW WHICH I APPRECIATE SEEING- FROM THE W. C. EVERYONE ELSE. BUT. FOR SOME REASON THERE'S STILL GAP AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. BRIDGE THAT GAP. WELL I COULD CERTAINLY- THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION YOU KNOW I WILL CERTAINLY SAY THAT THERE WAS LOTS OF THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IN OUR SYSTEM IN THE KILL ME PROCESS GLOBALLY IS THE PANEL SYSTEM THE BEST WAY IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS I MEAN IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET A Q. I MEAN FOR AN INJURED WORKER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A PANEL SYSTEM OF THREE DOCTORS REGION FIVE DOCTORS AS THE STATE OUGHT TO RECOGNIZE WHY NOT JUST HAVE. ONE DOCTOR RANDOMLY SELECTED BY COULD BUY IT BY THE D. W. C. HERE'S YOUR POSITION YOU NEED TO SEE THIS POSITION I MEAN IF VOTE SERVE WITHOUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT ABOUT I MEAN THERE ARE LOTS OF OPTIONS OUT THERE I THINK AGAIN WOULD THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR STATE OR STAKEHOLDERS TO GET TOGETHER AND SAY LOOK THIS IS THE BEST WAY FOR US I THINK EVERYBODY HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT INJURED WORKERS GET BACK TO WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE A TAKE THEIR AND TAKE THEIR CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION GOT IT LET ME INVITE THE STATE AUDITOR BACK UP IF. YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT JUST BECAUSE. AND THEN AND THEN WE'LL MOVED- QUESTIONSBUT AS I HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS. ABOUT THE QUESTION RIVER. GOING FROM. IT'S KIND OF PIGGY BACK ON YOUR QUESTION. BECAUSE IT'S SOI'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU INDICATED. AND I IS SPECIFICALLY NAY DIDN'T COUNT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT YOU SAID IF WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER TWO. YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD DO THIS WE SHOULD DO THIS WHAT DOES IT TAKE OR WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE FROM NOW ON FOR YOU GUYS TO BE PROACTIVE. AND NOT FOR IT TO TAKE AN AUDITED. TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE YOU'VE INDICATED THAT YOU KNEW THESE ISSUES WERE ALREADY A PROBLEM. AND SO. UNTIL LEGISLATION DROPPED OR THE AUDIT WAS DROPPED THEN NOW YOU'RE DOING ALL OF THIS SO WHAT DOES IT TAKE. BECAUSE THIS THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED. AND SOLD TO THE TIMELINE OUR QUESTION IS. SO WHAT WOULDN'T SOLVE THIS WOULD NOT. HAVE HAPPENED. THEN THEN WE WOULD BE IN THE SAME. BOAT SO IT TOOK. LEGISLATION AND IN ON IT. FOR THIS TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO BE PROACTIVE AND FOR US TO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS. TO FORCE AND I DON'T WANT TO FORCE THE DEPARTMENT TO DO ANYTHING IF THE DEPARTMENT IS ACTUALLY DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED. BUT WE WERE MOVING FORWARD ON THE MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE BEFORE THE AUDIT WAS REQUESTED- SO WE WERE TAKING STEPS IN THAT REGARD- AND THEN. AND AS I THINK PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF THAT IF THAT'S IF THAT'S MADE- IF THAT. FEE SCHEDULE IS UPDATED THAT THAT'S GOING TO HOPEFULLY BRING IN MORE. WHAT ON THE GATHERED IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING AND WE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET Q. AND NEEDS A LARGE MEDICAL GROUPS- BUT THE YOU KNOW AGAIN. AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT A MARKETING ARM I KNOW WE TALK TO PEOPLE WHICH WE TRY THE BEST THAT WE CAN. NO AGAIN WE RELY ON PRIVATE DOCTORS TO BE Q. IT NEEDS. NO I CAN'T BUT I CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER I CAN INCREASE THE POOL. WELL YOU CAN'T INCREASE THE POOL BUT YOU CAN UGH INCREASE THE YOU CAN ENTICE FOLKS TO DO IT I WAS A TEACHER. AND WHEN THERE'S A LACK OF TEACHERS THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT WERE BEING DONE IN THE LOOK THE- YOU KNOW THE HARD TO FILL- POSITION FOR. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE TO MAKE SURE TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS. AND IT I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON IT AGAIN MY QUESTION. NOW ON AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO- TO BE MORE. ACTIVE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANOTHER ARE AN AUDITOR MORE LEGISLATION AND- AS YOU INDICATED THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. WELL AS FAR MORE THAN THAN YOU KNOW AS- WE'VE GOT WE HAVE A STATE AUDIT WE'VE HAD THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE GOING TO. WORK AND WORK ON FILLING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I AND I WILL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH. BUT I BUT I'M GOING TO FIGURE OUT IS THIS A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE WHERE WERE BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST YOUR DEPARTMENT WITH THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF. OTHER AUDITS WHERE IT TAKES US TO FORCE THE HAND AND I. THINK THAT THAT'S- COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IF THE DEPARTMENT OR YOUR DEPARTMENT IS REALLY LOOKING AT IT THE CONVERSATIONS ARE GREAT BUT IF THERE'S NO ACTION AFTER THE CONVERSATIONS. THEN WE HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE I'VE I ACTUALLY SPENT TEN YEARS IN HUMAN RESOURCES DOING WORKERS COMPENSATION. AND I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT- THAT I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN GOING ON SINCE I WAS AN HR THEY HAPPEN AND SO. AND SO I MEAN WE WILL WE WILL CERTAINLY WORK THE BEST WE CAN BUT IN CERTAIN TERMS IT MAYBE IT JUST MAY BE A STRUCTURAL ISSUE. MAY BE OR DO YOU THINK IT IS. I AM IN I'M LOOKING RIGHT LOOK I'M NOT GOING TO NO NO NO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND FRANKLY I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IN MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS PROBABLY IT'S A STRUCTURE. IT'S A STRUCTURAL ISSUE SO THEN WE MAY NOT WE ORDERED BY THE DRESS MAYBE WE HAVE SHOULD TAKE MAYBE WE HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS. YOU KNOW IS THIS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO MANTA IS THIS THE BEST WAY TO ACTUALLY OPERATE THIS. NO BECAUSE I CAN SO I CAN KEEP TRYING TO. YOU KNOW TO FIX FIX THE FIX A FLAT TIRE THE GRANT GETTING FLATTER AND FLATTER AND- YOU KNOW MY WORK IS GOING TO GO FROM FOR BANDAIDS- BUT BANDAIDS ON THE ACTIONS OF ITS A STRUCTURAL ISSUE I WOULD HOPE THAT AFTER. TODAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO- PUT LEGISLATION FORWARD OR OR AN AUDIT FOR THIS. IN THE AYE WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS FOR IT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE MORE PROACTIVE AND LOOK AT THESE ISSUES BEFORE WE HAVE TO COME IN AND DO IT. RIGHT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT AT SOME POINT IF WE SAY LOOK. YOU KNOW WE'VE TRIED THIS AND IT'S NOT WORKING WELL THEN WE NEED SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT AND THE OTHER QUESTION THAT. THE PAIN WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES SO THAT ISSUE I WOULD HOPE WOULD GET ADDRESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES THEN WHY ARE WE JUST GOING TO DROP IT. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES IS OUR PLAN. IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE NO RESOURCES NOW WE'RE TO FIX RIGHT. RIGHT AND THEN AS I MENTIONED FOR IN TERMS. IN TERMS OF REVIEWING REPORTS FOR QUALITY. KNOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE MEANT PROFESSION SO THAT WE THINK REACHING OUT COMMUNITY FOR FORMER COMMITTEE WERE WRITTEN BRING PEOPLE IN TO TAKE A LOOK AT THEM. WHAT THE HELL. SO I THINK WE KNOW WE DO WE DO ALSO HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE DO HAVE. AND WHAT REPORT. THESE ARE. WE DON'T KNOW. ABOUT THAT. THAT'S WE- WAIVE. BUT. COMMENT ON THAT ARE LIKE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S A METHODOLOGY WOULD WE DOING HOW COME WE'RE NOT SELECTING FROM THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF PHYSICIANS. WELL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW AND I CAN'T. AND I CAN'T PROVIDE AN ANSWER FOR. NO AS I SAY WE HAVE AN ONLINE PANEL SYSTEM WHERE WE WERE THE PARTY REQUESTING A PANEL GOES ON. NO GOES ON OR COMPUTER SYSTEM AND GETS A RANDOM SELECTION OF THREE Q. M. MEANS. MOM I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT WORKS OPEN I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT A TECH PERSON. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALGORITHMS INVOLVED- AND- AND- WE VAST R. I. T. UNIT. FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU IN THESE ARE GETTING. NO ARE. YOU IN THE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM. ARE GETTING SELECTED. IF THEY'RE NOT. WELL THEN WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR ALGORITHMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS A FAIR SHOT AT A PANEL. THEN THAT. SEEMS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR EARLIER EXAMPLE IN MY EXAMPLE FROM DOWN IN THE DISTRICT WHERE PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT EVEN BEING SELECTED. OBVIOUSLY FOR MAKE THAT PILL. THAT PULL LARGER. YOU WOULD. JUST THINK THAT. THE DELAY TIME WOULD BE A LOT LESS. RIGHT RIGHT IN THE RIGHT. C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS IS BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE'VE GOT A SHRINKING. SHRINKING BODY OF Q. AMIS WELL. YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE- SEE THEM IN THEIR QUEUE IN THESE ARE NOT GETTING. SELECTED FOR PANELS. THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND SO THAT PROBABLY TO GET FIXED. CUT OUR- ICE UP MORE QUESTIONS I KNOW. A LOT OF. WORK HERE HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I MEAN I THOUGHT IF YOU. WANT TO COMMENT ON ANYTHING THAT WAS AND IF. AND WHEN THE DOUBLE QUESTION. NOW I. DON'T HAVE A- TICKET COMMENT. ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID BUT I. FOR THE RECORD A SENATOR ROTH ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT IF A SUB STANDARD. Q. IN THE REPORT THAT WAS REJECTED. A WHETHER OR NOT THAT INDIVIDUAL GETS PAID AND MY COUNSEL IN THE AUDIENCE GAVE ME LABOR CODE SECTION SPECIFIES THAT FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS. FOR OPT. PREPARING THE REPORT IF IT'S NOT ADMISSIBLE IT'S NOT ACCEPTED BY THE JUDGE THE MEDICAL LEGAL EXPENSES ARE NOT PAID SO THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD NOT BE PAID- GOOD SO THERE IS A SENSE OF THAT LATELY REPORT I JUST MEASURE MINTS AND- WILL COMMENT AND THAT'S- THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BUT E DO YOU KNOW WE DO SEE SITUATIONS WHERE. HE'LL REPORT WILL ISSUE AN UNDER OUR BILLING RULES THE REPAIR BILL THE REPORT HAS TO BE PAID WITHIN SIXTY DAYS IT COULD BE THAT A CARRIER PAYS THE REPORT BUT THE REPORTS NOT SUBMITTED IN THE HEARING UNTIL AFTER THAT IT GETS REJECTED BUT THE REPORT IS STILL PAID. OUT ESSENTIALLY THAT IS CORRECT. QUATRE ART CISCO TO MOVE TO SENATOR ROTH AND SENATOR MORE LOCK. AND THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. IF TREATMENT DISPUTES ARE NO LONGER ADDRESSED BY THE QUEUE IN ME WHAT TYPE OF DISPUTE IS ADDRESSED IS A OBVIOUSLY A WERE THE WORK RELATED THIS OF THE INJURY IS THAT THE DISPUTE RIGHT IS A COVERED CLAIM NUMBER ALSO A TALKING ABOUT TEMPORARY DISABILITY- FULL OF THERE'S A LOT OF DETERMINATIONS ABOUT PERMANENT DISABILITY SO FOR TREATING PHYSICIAN SAYS. YOU KNOW THIS INJURED WORKER IS HAS A 36% THE WHOLE PERSON IMPAIRMENT AND PARTY DISPUTES THAT IT WOULD GO TO A Q. ME. SO YOU SEE ISSUES LIKE TOP. OF THE CERTAINLY THE WORK RELATEDNESS OF THE CLAIM IS SORT OF A- STARTER NON STARTER FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS IS. THAT'S RIGHT SO THIS IS A PRETTY CRITICAL. ISSUE THE TIMELINESS OF THE QUEUE IN ME FOR THE RESPECT TO THE INJURED WORKER WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN THE FOR THE CARRIERS AND ALL THE REST IF WE DON'T MOVE THE PROCESS ALONG AND NOBODY. KNOWS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH US CORRECT RIGHT UP AND THAT PROCESS WE AGREED NEEDS TO BE FOR A NEEDS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE CUMAE REQUESTS CAN YOU TELL ME WHO WHAT PERCENTAGE OF REQUESTED BY. LAWYERS AND WHAT PERCENTAGE YOU REQUESTED BY THE INJURED WORKERS REPRESENTATIVES- I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I HONESTLY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD DO NOT KNOW THAT DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBER WE CAN CERTAINLY FIND THAT OUT. WOULD BE AN INTERESTING. STATISTIC I WOULD THINK OF HIM. TO GO TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS ABOUT TO. THE TIMELINESS OF THE PROCESS. SO WITH RESPECT TO THESE. Q. AMIS- HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE. I THINK OF. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED AND HOW MANY DO YOU NEED. I GUESS IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND ON WHAT'S WHERE DID WHERE DID THE NUMBER OF REQUEST WHERE THAT NUMBER GOING BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU WE FOR SO WE KNOW HOW MANY WORKERS COMP CLAIMS WE HAVE RIGHT WE KNOW HOW MANY. ARE INVOLVED REPRESENTED WORKERS. WE WILL KNOW I GUESS WHEN YOU CHECK IT WOULD SHOW MANY REFER TO ME REQUEST COME FROM EMPLOYERS AND HOW MANY COME FROM THE REPRESENTED WORKERS WE SHOULD KNOW BY. GEOGRAPHY WERE THE CLAIMS ARE COMING FROM A LOT OF THEM I ASSUME WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE WORKERS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO HOW MANY Q. IN THE- FOR DO YOU NEED GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE OF TYPICAL ON WORKERS COMP WE DON'T KNOW THAT NUMBER RIGHT AND THEN ONCE YOU KNOW HOW MANY YOU NEED VERSUS HOW MANY YOU HAVE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER THERE'S A SHORT FALL ON WHERE THE SHORTFALL IS WELL WE SEE THE NUMBER OF PANEL REQUESTS RISING SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REQUEST WE SHOULD HAVE A COMPETENT. THE COMP NUMBER OF Q. AND- YOU KNOW TO ADDRESS THAT I THINK WE PROBABLY SHOULD NEED MORE IF WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED BOY WOULD BE GREAT IF WE HAD TEN THOUSAND BUT YOU SEE OUR PROBLEM HERE- WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT IMPACT. OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND DEPENDING ON WHICH SIDE OF THE AISLE YOU ARE I MEAN WE HAVE DIFFERENT WE TO THESE ISSUES FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY GRETA SO WHERE YOU ARE AND- IN THE CHAMBERS. DOWNSTAIRS YOU'RE- MAKING SURE THAT INJURED WORKERS GET TAKEN CARE OF. BECAUSE THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS MAYBE I CAN ASK CLASSES QUESTION THIS WAY. OF BECAUSE WE SAW THAT PANELS QUADRUPLED BUT MAYBE HOW MANY KILOMETERS DO WE NEED TO NOT TRIGGER THE SIXTY DAY. WELL I JUST WANNA KNOW YOU LISTEN IF YOU KNOW HOW MANY CLAIMS YOU HAVE RIGHT. AND YOU KNOW HOW MANY REPRESENTED CASES YOU YOU'RE INVOLVED WITH AND Q. IN ME DECISIONS GO TO THE VERY HEART OF THE WORKERS COMP PROCESS WHICH IS THE INJURY WORK RELATED. WE I DON'T KNOW AND WE KNOW HOW MANY Q. IN THESE ARE IN YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM. YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO COMPUTE HOW MANY Q. A MAJOR NEED. IF THERE'S A DELAY IN GETTING Q. AMAZED TO TAKE ON CASES. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD AT MATH WHICH IS NOT ME. NOT ME EITHER IN FORT WE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT. FIGURE AND THEN FROM THAT WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT THE PROBLEM AS WELL OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION SO I'LL DROP IT BUT LET ME AS IS. HAVE WE GONE OUT TO THE FOLKS WHO USED TO BE Q. AMIS OR WHO. ARE NOT Q. AMIS. THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OR OTHERWISE TO DETERMINE AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY. AREN'T PHYSICIANS INDIES TEO'S. SIGNING UP TO BE. QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS REVISED WAITERS IN OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. WE HAVEN'T- DIRECTLY HAD ASKED THAT QUESTION BUT WITH THE TIME I ASK OF PHYSICIANS WHY ARE THEY NOT Q. IT MEANS THEY COME BACK AND SAY WORKERS COMPENSATION IS TOO COMPLICATED- AND FRANKLY WE DON'T WANTED WE DON'T WANT TO GO NEAR IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE ONES THAT ARE STILL IN THE SYSTEM ONE HIGHER. PAY AND I GET THAT AND I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE ONES THAT ARE NOT IN THE SYSTEM ARE NOT IN THE SYSTEM FOR REASON I'M WONDERING IF IT COULD BE THE. YOU KNOW MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR STANDARDS YOU KNOW. LICENSE TO PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA WELL THAT'S A GOOD THING WE WANT THAT. SPEND AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF THEIR TIME PROVIDING DIRECT MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH THAT PROBABLY GOES TO WHETHER YOU CAN BE RETIRED OR NOT. REPORT FINANCIAL INTEREST WE DON'T WANT CONFLICTS AND TAKE AT LEAST A TWELVE OUR COURSE AND WRITING MEDICAL LEGAL REPORTS. I DON'T YOU'LL HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT THAT'S INVOLVED. AND PASS THE COMPETENCY EXAM. YOU KNOW IS IT THE COPPERS HE EXAM THAT BOTHERS US. OR BOTHERS THEM WHY ARE PEOPLE FLUNKING THE COMPETENCY EXAM IF THEY GET THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND WE KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT I THINK I THINK A GOOD PART OF THAT REASON IS THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE GOOD AT. WRITING HEALTH CARE BUT TO PASS THIS TEST THEY NEED TO KNOW SOME OF THE RULES AND ROEG'S AROUND WORKERS COMPENSATION CIVIC LAY AROUND BEING ACCUSED ME. AND LESS AND LESS YOU STUDY- FOR THIS TEST AND STUDY THOSE RULES IN RAGS- IT'S DIFFICULT TO PASS THIS EXAMINATION YEAH AND I BELIEVE IT'S NOT A CLINICAL TEST BECAUSE- AND I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR Là HOT IT TALKS ABOUT. THREE FACTORS OF WHY YOU BELIEVE PHYSICIANS ARE BECOMING Q. ENEMIES. ARE THOUGHT IT READ THAT. WELL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIVISION TO TELL US WHY THE DIVISION THINKS THAT. FOLKS ARE BECOMING Q. AMIS BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ON THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM FUNCTIONS APPROPRIATELY. YEAH IT IS I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED- YOU KNOW THE EFFECT OF THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE HAS CHANGED OVER THE LAST. FEW YEARS CAN I GET THAT THAT AND I CAN I THINK I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A BIG REASON AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MULTI SPECIALTY PRACTICE GROUPS KAISER AND- YOU KNOW THE X. Y. Z. MEDICAL GROUP IT'S DOWN THE STREET THEY HAVE A CERTAIN EXPECTATION FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOURS A DAY ON THEIR EMPLOYED. EMPLOYEE PHYSICIANS. OF UFC A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PATIENTS A DAY THIS IS NOT TREATING MEDICINE THIS IS REVIEWING REPORTS AND WRITING ANOTHER REPORT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY COMPLICATED ENOUGH BUT I HAVE TO PASS A COMPETENCY TEST. AS ALLIES CALIFORNIA XIN SPOKE IF YOU'RE OF A MEDICAL MULTI SPECIALTY MEDICAL GROUP YOU'RE NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. ON CUBA ME WORK. NUMBER OF SOLO PRACTITIONERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. DIMINISHING AND HAS DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY BUT MY POINT EARLIER. WHEN I MADE YES THE QUESTION IS STATE AUDITOR'S THAT'S THE FACT OF LIFE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REINVENT THE WHEEL. ONCE WE DETERMINE. WHAT THE DELTA IS BETWEEN THE QUEUE IN ME IS THAT YOU HAVE. AND THE NUMBER THAT YOU NEED AND THE AND LESS WE KNOW THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH OF SOLUTION WHETHER IT'S LEGISLATIVE. OR OTHERWISE USE. YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT MAKE BETS. I DON'T I PROBABLY OF OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I'M GOING TO SHUT UP AND LET ME ALSO THANK YOU. THANKYOU. MOVED TO CENTER MORE LACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MISTER PER SOTO- COULD YOU EXPLAIN IN A FEW WORDS YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMP. JUST IN CASE SOMEONE TO WALK IN. TO KNOW WHAT DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IS AND WHAT IS. HOW MANY STAFF WELL. I CAN'T TELL YOU THE OVERALL STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS YOU KNOW IT IS THE DEPARTMENT THAT REGULATES. COMES IN THE WORKPLACE. IT CONSISTS OF THE DIVISION OF LABOR- STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW THEY LOOK AT WAGE WAGE AN HOUR. OF OUR EMPLOYEES GETTING PAID PROPERLY ON THEIR- ROCKY PATIENT SAFETY AND HEALTH. LOOKS OUT OF THEM ORDER COMPLETE YOUR PLAYING WITH SAFETY STANDARDS AND OTHERS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION THAT REGULATES WHAT A REGULATES WORKERS COMPENSATION- WE HAVE ABOUT A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES- MANY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN OUR DISTRICT ALL THIS. THE PERMIT ON PRACTICALLY ALL MAJOR CITIES WE HAVE TO THE KITCHEN STAFF IN THESE ARE IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES THAT'S COMPRISED OF WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGES IN THE SUPPORT STAFF THAT THAT THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO HEAR CASES. OF AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE OUR IN A SENSE ARE REGULATORY ARM WHICH IS TRADITIONALLY BEEN TRADITIONALLY USED TO REGULATE THE PRACTICE- OF CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION SO WE WOULD LOOK AT DAY WE LOOK AT INSURANCE COMPANIES CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COMPLYING WITH OUR OBLIGATIONS- OVER THE PAST. TWENTY YEARS PROBABLY STARTING WITH THE S. B. EIGHT EIGHT NINETY NINE WE'VE BEEN TAKING ON MORE OF THE MEDICAL ASPECT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION WE WERE WE'VE BEEN INSTRUCTED IN MANDATED TO PUT IN A MEDICAL TREATMENT UTILIZATION SCHEDULE- WITH THE PRACTICE OF UTILIZATION REVIEW HAS BEEN PUT INTO WORKERS COMPENSATION- MEDICAL PRACTICE- MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS- HAS BEEN PUT IN SO WE'VE BEEN UP. TAKING ON MORE OF THAT AND I THINK THAT WAS DUE PRODUCT TO OUR- TAKING ON THE INDUSTRIAL MEDICAL COUNCIL AND AGAIN THAT WAS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR SO- WE HAVE THE SYSTEM WHERE WE WERE TRYING TO RECORD REGULATE- IN REGULATE WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION. UNDERSTANDING THAT A LOT OF CLAIMS ARE JUDICATA THAN THAT SERIAL ABOUT. SO YOUR REGULAR- IN THE WORKERS COMP SPACE AND I WON'T FIND ANOTHER DIVISION OF WORKERS COME UP. WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. NO NO OKAY AND DO YOU BELIEVE THE AUDIT WAS FAIR AND PROFESSIONAL I'M- I REALLY WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION FOR THE AUDITOR TO COME IN AND UNDERSTAND WORKERS COMPENSATION IN THE WHOLE PROCESS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A FEW YEARS AND I CAN'T SAY I UNDERSTAND EVERY ASPECT OF IT. MOM I APPRECIATE THE WORK THEY DID THEY CAME IN THEY DID AN AUDIT I. I AM I TAKE NO ISSUE WITH THE WAY IT WAS CONDUCTED. EARLIER YOU SAID YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S RIGHT AND WHILE WE MAY DISAGREE WITH YOU KNOW WITH SOME CHARACTERIZATIONS OF WHAT'S GOING ON YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT I UNDERSTAND THEIR POSITION. NAM Y. UNDERSTAND OUR POSITION AND WHILE. I WON'T MAKE THEM AGREE WITH BUT Y. CAN'T. TAKE A GROUP ME I WON'T AGREE WITH THEM BUT THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE- BUT AS I SAY WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT IT'S REACTIVE. I'M A LOT OF A LOT OF IT IS I WILL SAYS IT YOU KNOW BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE WERE MOVING AHEAD ON THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE YOU KNOW WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM MORE EFFICIENT- AND WE'RE- WERE DOING THE BEST WE CAN WE'RE AND WE'RE- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T LOOKED OUT. AND THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE- AND WE WILL WE WILL MAKE IT WE WILL. DO BETTER BECAUSE BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY. I ALWAYS TRY TO TELL MY PEOPLE YOU KNOW WE JUST NEED TO DO BETTER. SO AND DOING BETTER- BUT HAVE YOU FOUND AREAS WHERE YOU'RE SAYING. YOU KNOW WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED OR WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT SKILL SETS. AND HAVE YOU APPROACH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR. MORE STAFFING OR FOR. BETTER CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AGENCY YOU KNOW TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO DO YOU KNOW THAT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO DO OUR JOB. AND SO WHEN YOU SAY THE LABOR AGENCIES AT THE LABOR AND WORK FOR SATAN FLEE THAT'S CORRECT SO HOW DOES HE ORG CHART WORK. YOUR THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMP YOU'RE UNDER THE- DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIONS AND IT IS UNDER THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE AGENCY. WHICH IS UNDER THE SECRETARY WHO IS. NINE ZERO SECRETARY THAT THEY REPORT TO AND THEN IT THEN THE GOVERNOR YES WHO'S THE SECRETARY- IT JULIE SAID. OKAY. CURRENT THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE THREE SHORT QUESTIONS AND ONE COMMENT. SO. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. I'M I'M OFTEN CONFUSED BY STAKEHOLDERS SO COULD YOU DEFINE YOUR TOP THREE STAKEHOLDERS THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. WELL PRIMARILY WEEK WE HAVE INJURED WORKERS WE HAVE- THE EMPLOYERS AND THE CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAVE OUR PROVIDERS. SB EIGHT SIXTY THREE THE REFORM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WAS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND ORGANIZED LABOR. SO I WOULD CONSIDER ALL OF THOSE GROUPS TO BE OUR STAKEHOLDERS THANK OU SIR. HOW MANY PAGES ARE THE QUEUE AND MAY REPORTS. IT CAN VERY DEPEND UPON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASE- AND THE IN THE ISSUE AT HAND YOU COULD SEE REPORTS THAT ARE ARE EIGHT OR NINE PAGES YOU COULD SEE REPORTS THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED PAGES OR MORE IT REALLY DEPENDS UPON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ISSUE. NO KILLER BEES ARE SUPPOSED TO DECIDE THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE IN DISPUTE. THANK YOU SO. AND WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF AN ALGORITHM IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. WE'RE THROWING AROUND WORDS ALGORITHM YOU KNOW. I'M BORN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. COMPUTERS AND ALGORITHMS- WERE INVENTED AFTER ME SOLD COULD YOU DEFINE THAT FOR ME MY DAUGHTER HAS TOLD ME I WAS OLD YOU KNOW I WATCHED YOU KNOW TO ME I WATCH EPISODES OF DRAGNET AND THAT'S THE HEIGHT THE TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW AN ALGORITHM IS YOU KNOW IT AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE OUR OUR OUR OUR COMPUTER SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT PUTS SELECTS Q. EMMYS RANDOMLY TO BE PUT ON A PAIR ALL. AND IT'S DONE ACCORDING TO A COMPUTER PROGRAM I'M IN THE COMPUTER PROGRAM HOW IT WORKS LIKE YOU KNOW I'D HAVE TO SAY I JUST CANNOT SAY- BUT OUR I. T. THE TO THE- INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY UNIT OF THE DEPARTMENT- HAS TOLD US THERE IS OUR SPECIFIC MEANS OF WAYS OF DOING THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT. OKAY IN. MY FINAL COMMENT IT. I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR- GOES INTO UNKNOWN TERRITORY CONSTANTLY AND THEN HAS TO. PUT TOGETHER WHAT THEY OBSERVE SO IT'S NEVER PERFECT NEVER CAMPY AND I APPRECIATE THAT GREATLY THE BECAUSE WHOEVER THEY AUDIT. AND THE REACTION OF THE AUDIT. TENDS TO BE VERY POSITIVE AND I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I FEEL GOOD- AND THEN I HAVE A COMMENT FOR THE CHAIR. I'M OUT THERE NOW OKAY I'M ON THE EDGE. SO. THIRTY NINE YEARS OF OBSERVING THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND IT CHANGES CONSTANTLY AND NO ONE BUT EVERYONE'S RIGHT NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THE MONSTER WE'VE CREATED OKAY. I MEAN IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. I HAVE ONE RECOMMENDATION THAT EITHER THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO CARRY THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE OR ANY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. IS MANY OF THE WORK ONCE YOU GET A WORKERS COMP CLAIM THAT BECOMES LIKE THE HOLY GRAIL OKAY IT'S GOT TO GO THROUGH TE WORKERS COMP OF SAUSAGE MAKING MACHINE. AND MANY TIMES THE WORKERS ARE NOT SERVE CORRECTLY I MEAN THIS IS THE WAY IT IS AND MANY TIMES THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT SERVE CORRECTLY BECAUSE OF THE LITIGATION SYSTEM. SO HERE'S MY SILLY IDEA. WHAT IF WE ESTABLISHED A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WORKERS COMP CLAIM AND NOW I'M JUST MAKING THIS UP FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OKAY THAT GOES TO GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE. MANY MOST THEM PLEASE HAVE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE IF WE HAD A CONDUIT TO BY PASS THE SMALL WORKERS COMP CLAIMS IT JUST SIMPLY CALL YOUR DOCTOR GET YOUR HAND FIXED HAVE THE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE PAY FOR IT. YOU'RE OUT OF THE SYSTEM ONE FOR FIVE GRAND- BELOW TRUST ME THAT WOULD SAVE IN MY ESTIMATION ONCE AGAIN I'M MAKING THINGS UP 47% OF WORKERS COMP PREMIUMS. JUST BY FUNNELING IT OFF THE HEALTH INSURANCE. AND HEALTH INSURANCE IS DESIGNED FOR THE SMALL CLAIMS ANYWAY THAT'S MY COMMENT ON DONE THINK YEAH I THINK THERE'S MIGHT BE A MODEL I WAS LOOKING AT IN FRESNO THAT KINDA. DOES THAT IT SENDS INJURED WORKERS TO GO GET TREATMENT. AND THEN THEY FIGURE OUT THE WORKERS COMP CLAIM ON THE BACK END BUT THEY FOUND IT ACTUALLY SAVED MONEY TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AND I GOT WORKERS TO WORK QUICKER WHICH THEN YOU KNOW ALLEVIATE A LOT OF- THE FRUSTRATIONS. WITH PEOPLE THAT WERE INJURED I THINK THEY DID IT WITH PUBLIC SAFETY- SENATOR ROBB WHICH IS ONE QUESTION ON THE PANELISTS. YOU KNOW WHEN I USED TO DO LABOR WORK LABOR MANAGEMENT WORK AND WE'D- SOLICITOR PANELS OF ARBITRATORS OR MEDIATORS FOR THAT FOR THAT MATTER FROM THE NATIONAL SERVICES WOULD GET A PANEL OF TEN TO FIFTEEN PEOPLE. AND IT WAS A STRIKE SITUATION AS WELL ONE SIDE WOULD STRIKE THE OTHER WHICH STRIKE INTO WE AGREED TO A PARTICULAR PERSON. I KNOW YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT YOUR PANEL IS THERE ANY LEGISLATIVE OR A STATUTORY OR REGULATORY RESTRICTION ON THE NOT BUILD THE SIZE OF YOUR PANEL THAT YOU SEND OUT TO PEOPLE IN THE WORKERS COMPRESSES I THINK IN STATUTES REQUIRED TO BE THREE. OKAY SO THAT TO ENSURE THE CHAIRS QUESTION THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF IS THERE ARE. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE STATUTE OF THE REGULATION THAT LIMITS GEOGRAPHICALLY THE LOCATION OF pTHE HUMAN MAYES THAT ARE LISTED ON THE PANEL. SHEET THAT'S GIVEN TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCESS I DON'T BELIEVE SO. I DON'T ELIEVE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S AN STATURE AND THEN THE ONLY ISSUE THEN I ASSUME WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE INJURED WORKER WE- MIGHT NEED TO TRANSPORT HIMSELF OR HERSELF TO THE QUEUE IN THESE OFFICE. TO THE EXTENT THAT IN AN IN OFFICE EVALUATION IS. NECESSARY REQUIRED IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE. AND I ASSUME. THAT INJURED WORKERS IN THE TYPICAL CASE WHERE THE CLAIMS BEEN ACCEPTED WILL BE WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THAT TRANSPORT. BUT IN A CASE WHERE WORK REAL THE WORK RELATEDNESS OF THE INJURY IS AT ISSUE. IS THE EMPLOYEE ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION. FOR THAT INITIAL Q. IN THE VISIT. MILEAGE COMPENSATION BY I'D I'D I'D HAVE TO SAY I'M NOT I AM NOT SURE OF THE TOP OF MY HEAD SO I BUT THAT'S- OBVIOUSLY A STATUTE OR REGULATORY GRAPHICS IF NECESSARY RIGHT AT THE CHAIR IN. IN HIS EFFORTS WOULD NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT AS WELL. PERFECT THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET ME- JUST TOUCH ON TWO MORE THINGS LOS THE AUDITOR WANTS TO CHIME IN ON ANYTHING OKAY ONLY BECAUSE OF THE WAY THINGS ARE BROUGHT UP EARLIER THAT WE REALLY HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON AND THAT'S THE DUE PROCESS. FOR FOLKS THAT I HAVE- NOT BEEN RESTORED IS IT RECERTIFIED TO RE APPROVED POINTED REAPPOINTED SO HE TALK ABOUT THAT AND WHAT'S THE- WHAT IS OUR DUE PROCESS WHAT CAN THEY DO BECAUSE I THINK. THE AUDITOR IN HER STATEMENT EARLIER HAD TALKED ABOUT SO MANY. SO MANY REPORTS WERE RAD THEY WENT THROUGH LIKE EIGHTY SIX BUT THEY DIDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU JUST TALK TO US ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY AREN'T WE- FIGURE OUT A- BETTER SYSTEM FOR THAT. WELL OUR FOR TALKING ABOUT THE DISCIPLINE I AM I THINK WE ARE WE HAVE REACHED A BETTER SYSTEM FOR THAT I THINK OF SOME OF THE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS- M. HAVE BEEN. HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED OF WE DO DO DO WILL TRACKS NOW IN THE PAST. WHEN WE'VE HAD WHEN WE'VE HAD ISSUES OF PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES. YOUR COMPLAINT WOULD COME IN IN THE COMPLAINT WOULD GET PUT TO THE SIDE. AND HOPE POSSIBLY NOT ADDRESSED UNTIL THE REAPPOINTMENT ISSUE THIS WAS HAPPENING IN 200-014-2000 SIXTEEN- BUT I WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT- WE THINK WE HAVE. PUSHED FORWARD- IF A COMPLAINT COMES IN WE WANT TO NOTIFY. THE QB RIGHT AWAY ABOUT THAT AND WE WANT TO INITIATE WE KNOW WE WANT TO INITIATE THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING. RIGHT NOW- THAT'S THE TITLE TRACK THAT'S A DUAL TRACK OF THE AUDIT AND THE AUDITOR HAS ASKED US TO PUT DOWN THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN WRITING AND WE ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO DO THAT. THAT AND THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT FLLOWS THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT WHEN YOU DO THAT. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT WE IF WE FOLLOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT IN BOTH THE DISCIPLINE AND THE RE APPOINTMENT PROCESS. GOT IT. OKAY I THINK I'M JUST TRYING TO PROCESS SAID. OKAY LET ME ASK ABOUT THE- BECAUSE THE OTHER THING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS A CURE ME REPORT QUALITY. READY WE TOUCHED ABOUT THE FINANCE I THINK MISTER ROTH HAD BROUGHT UP SOME ROCK. HOW CAN WE ARE WHAT IS A PART WAS THE HAVE YOU SEE DOING TO. HELP COVER THAT GAP IF YOU KNOW YOUR SPITTING A REPORT AND IT'S NOT COMPLETE AND THEN BEING KICKED BACK DOWN AND WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GETTING REIMBURSED OR NOT. HOUSE APARTMENT INVOLVED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE QUALITY REPORT SO THAT WHEN LOOKING AT TIME EFFICIENCY. AND EFFICIENCY OVERALL. YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING THE SYSTEM BETTER. WELL A MEDICAL REPORT HAS TO CONSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL MEDICAL EVIDENCE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE SURE AT LEAST IN THE INITIAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION PROCESS. THE Q. M. IS NO WATER QUALITY REPORT IS IN OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ARE ARE ARE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A QUALITY REPORT- ONCE WE GET THAT AS A- AS I SAY WE WANT TO INCREASE THAN THE AMOUNT. OF HOURS NEEDED FOR PERSON TO TAKE A REPORT WRITING CLASS SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. NOW WHAT WE HAVE NOT DONE OF AND I WILL. READILY SALES LOOKED IN THE PAST AND THIS HAS NOT BEEN DONE WAS TAKING A LOOK AT THE REPORTS TO SEE IF THEY ACTUALLY MEET THOSE. STANDARDS OF QUALITY. OF AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND WE NEED TO GET THE REPORTS FROM OUR JUDGES ABOUT THAT WE NEED TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. AND AT THAT POINT ONCE WE EVALUATE THE REPORTS INDETERMINATE THERE'S AREAS LOT IN AREAS THAT ARE LACKING. AND WE NEED TO GO OUT AND ADVICE Q. IT MEANS THAT THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW I CAN'T STICK MY HANDS IN A CASE. AND SAY THIS IS WHAT THIS IS A LOUSY REPORT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AGAIN LITIGATE CASES. AND THAT'S NOT THE OWNER I CAN JUMP INTO INTO ANYTHING ABOUT. THE EXTENT. OF A JUDGE TELLS ME WITH A LOOK DONALD DOES HE REPORT. I CAN'T GO BACK TO THE Q. AND SAY YOU NEED TO FIX THIS REPORT. THAT'S A THAT'S AN OPEN LITIGATED CASES THAT NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH THROUGH THAT EDUCATION PROCESS. BUT WE CAN'T CREATE SOME STANDARDS FOR WHAT A REPORT SHOULD INCLUDE HELP AND WELL ROOF DATA QUALITY GOT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GET I THINK WE NEED. TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. IN OTHER WORDS IF WE'RE GONNA Và I'M GOINGTO PAY X. AMOUNT REPORT I NEED TO SEE A REPORT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE. ALL OF THESE STANDARDS IN IT OF ALL THAT WOULD MEET ALL OF THE STANDARD THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE. I MEAN I WOULD HOPE OUR OR OUR STAKEHOLDERS WILL WILL WILL REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THAT. THAT WE CAN PUT THAT FORWARD SO THAT WE LOOK AT THESE REPORTS WE CAN SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY MEET THAT. AND IF. WE SEE A TREND OR WAR OR SOMETHING INDICATING THAT THE Q. AMIS ARE NOT DOING THAT THAT WE CAN GO OUT AND SAY LOOK. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE WRITING REPORTS THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE OR ELSE. IF IT GETS BEFORE JUDGE WILL BITE HAVE A PROBLEM. GOT IT YEAH I'M NOT I'M JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE- PROVE THAT BECAUSE AS APPROVED ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL. IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BUT- SO YOU WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF THAT- THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. RIGHT TO WRITER THAT RIGHT RIGHT WE ARE TASKED WITH THAT. WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT WE NEED TO DO THAT. GOT IT AND TEN WE GO BACK TO TIMELINE BUT- STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND HOPEFULLY. YOU'RE SAYING I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD REACH. REACH SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT AGAIN I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS DONE BY REALLY SPREAD. OUT I KNOW CENTER ROTH ONE OF ADD ON WELL I LET ME JUST SAY THIS IF YOU KNOW I. HAVE HAD SOME INVOLVEMENT WITH THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM AND- AND THE JUDGES AND ALL THAT BUT- IF THIS WERE A CIVIL COURT. COURT AND SOMEONE SUBMITTED AN EXPERT SUBMITTED A REPORT THAT WAS INSUFFICIENT. INSTEAD OF GOING BACK FOR NEW DOCTORS IN NEW REPORTS AND SIX MORE MONTHS AND STRIKING ON PANELS. THE JUDGE WOULD SIMPLY ISSUE IN ORDER FOR THE PROVIDER TO COME TO COURT AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPORT IN. AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I SUPPOSE THAT. IT'S AN ATOMIC EXPLOSION WORKERS COMP SYSTEM BUT I THINK OUR PROCESS IS A LITTLE TOO BUREAUCRATIC- DESIGNED TO STRETCH OUT ON ON ON ON AND IF WHAT WE TAUGHT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A IS AN INSUFFICIENT REPORT. WERE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER FAILED ENDING AN EVALUATOR AN EXAMINER FAILED TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS ASSUMING IN THESE VARIOUS AREAS TEMPORARY DISABILITY PERMANENT DISABILITY WORK RELATEDNESS OF THE INJURY WE HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS AND ISSUES THAT AN EXAMINER NEEDS TO ADDRESS IN A REPORT. IN THE EXAMINER FAILS TO ADDRESS IT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT WE ARE THERE OUGHT TO BE AN EXPEDITED WAY TO FILL IN THE GAP. WITHOUT GOING BACK TO ANOTHER LIST OR ANOTHER EXAMINER OR NOT- YOU WAITER IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PROCESS AND IF IT IS I'D ASK YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WELL WE CERTAINLY WELL I WOULD I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU THAT I THINK WE JUST NEED TO HAVE. THE SYSTEM. IT'S VERY THE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN AN ADDICT INADEQUATE REPORT COMES BEFORE JUDGE ITO JUDGE HAS AN OPTION TO JUST IN ORDER TO CURE ME ORG OR GET A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. NO THERE ARE THERE ARE OPTIONS OUT THERE BUT BUT YOU'RE RIGHT STANDARDS ARE MET THEN SOME ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN. WE JUST DON'T NEED TO KEEP REINVENTING THE WHEEL OVER AND OVER. CUT IT RIGHT THIS WAS A SOUTHERN WARLOCK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST MAYBE TO WRAP UP WITH. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED THE AUDITOR- WE PURCHASE WORKERS COMP FOR DEPARTMENTS OR THEY USE A MASTER AGREEMENT. WE HAVE AN INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ELECTED WE HAVE A DIVISION OF WORKERS COMP. AND I'M JUST WONDERING TO HAVE SILOS OR DO WE HAVE SYNERGY. WHY THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION- I WHAT IS THE ANSWER THIS FROM MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION I CAN'T I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE SYNERGY. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE SILOS BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE CENTER. THANK YOU. CUT DID YOU. OKAY GREAT HELLO THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL APPRECIATE THAT WE DO WANT TO- WILL WORK WITH YOU ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE THINGS I THINK WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WERE TIMELINE IN THE SCHEDULE AND WHAT'S GOING TO FOLLOW UP I REGULAR THROUGH THE API- MYSTERY PROCEDURES ACT AND WHAT'S GOING TO JUST BE DONE- BY THE DEPARTMENT AND I THINK. WILL BE LOOKING EAGERLY. TO SEE HOW THAT'S A COMPLAINT. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WITH THAT WAS GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. AND THAT'S THE COMMENTS AND RESPONSES TO THE AUDIT. WE HAVE A ELLEN. LANDEL GENERAL COUNSEL CAL FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION IS TO DIANNE WORLEY STRUCTURE POLICY IMPLEMENTATION CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION JACOB ROSENBERG. MARZANO CALIFORNIA'S SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY- GABOR VARI BOARD MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY AND- NICHOLAS ROXBOROUGH CO MANAGING PARTNER OF ROXBOROUGH POMERANCE NINE DREAMY. **** IT HAVE YOU GUYS ALL COME UP AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN. WHOEVER LIKE TO BEGIN WE CAN. WE CAN START THERE WE CAN GO IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR LISTED ON THE AGENDA. ONE OF THE FIRST ITEM IS THE FIRST. I LOVE TO GO FIRST. THE JUST ANNOUNCED YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD RIGHT- I'M DIANE WORLEY AND THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. GO AHEAD PLEASE OKAY- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX. WHICH IS DEDICATED THIS WORK TO HELPING CALIFORNIANS THAT GET HURT ON THE JOB RECEIVE THE BENEFITS AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. IN A TIMELY MANNER AND GET BACK TO WORK WE ALSO PROBABLY AFFILIATED WITH THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN AND FORTY TWO. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO MAKE THE STATE AUDITOR ALAIN HELL FOR EXCELLENT WORK ON THIS REPORT OF COURSE NONE OF THE REPORT'S FINDINGS ARE SURPRISE TO US. IT HAS BEEN IT BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE A PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CUNY CRISIS THAT PRACTITIONERS IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING FOR MANY YEARS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT WE'VE MET WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BEFORE MISTER PARIS SOTOS TENURE. AND MANY TIMES DURING HIS TENURE TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THE SHORTAGE OF CUNY'S. AND UNFORTUNATE UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAD TO GET TO THIS PROCESS BUT AT LEAST NOW WE HAVE A PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT WE'RE IN A CRISIS MODE AND IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS FOR YEARS. AND HAS HAD A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT AN INJURED WORKERS. THE REPORT ITSELF IS CLEARLY AN INDICTMENT OF THE D. W. SEES HANDLING OF THE CURE ME SYSTEM WHICH HAS NECESSITATED THE NEED FOR THIS OVERSIGHT. THE AUDITOR'S RIGHT ON. BUT IT DOESN'T ADDRESS SOME ISSUES- THEY DON'T TELL THE FULL FOR THE STORY OF THE FULL NUMBERS OF THE QUEUE IN A CRISIS. INJURED WORKERS OFTEN HAVE TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES. TO SEE A QUEUE IN THE SPECIALIST AS THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE LIST IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. AND EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT. INJURED WORKERS CANNOT FIND. AN APPROPRIATE SPECIALISTS SPECIALISTS TO EVALUATE SOME OF THE MOST CATASTROPHIC INJURIES IN THE SYSTEM. SUCH AS TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES ARE CANCER. IF YOU HAVE A SPRAINED ANKLE YOU MIGHT BE LUCKY TO GET ORTHOPEDIST WHO WILL SEE YOU IN SIXTY DAYS BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR WHO SPECIALIZES IN CANCER AN ONCOLOGIST IN THE STATE WHAT SURVIVOR. THE AUDITOR WASN'T ASKED SPECIFICALLY TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES. BUT I'M SURE YOU ALL OR WHERE OR REMEMBER THAT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT THE B. C. ELIMINATED THE QUEUE IN THESE- SPECIALTY OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGY FROM THE PANELISTS. NEUROPSYCHOLOGY IS THE NUMBER ONE REQUESTED SPECIALTY FOR AN INJURED WORKER WHO HAS A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. WHEN THE RESPONSE TO THAT WAS TO INTRODUCE A BILL WHICH OBTAINED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND ENDED UP ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THE D. WC OPPOSE THAT AND FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN TO. VETO THAT BILL. THE AUDITOR HAD DIDN'T WITH AN ASKED TO LOOK AT WHY THEY'RE ONLY THREE ON COLLEGES Q. AMIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REVIEW. CANCER CASES WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR CUMAE PENALTY ISSUE AND THERE'S MANY OTHER SPECIALTIES WERE YOU CAN'T GET A PANEL. WHILE THE RECOMMENDATION OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CUBIES IS SUPPORT AT A WHILE FOUND IT. SOLELY INCREASING NUMBERS WILL NOT ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM OF THE LACK OF MUCH NEEDED MEDICAL SPECIALIST ON THE QUEUE IN THE LAST AND THE GEOGRAPHIC AVAILABILITY. WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S REPORT EXCEPT FOR IN ONE AREA. THE RECOMMENDATION FOR A LIST WITH FIVE NAMES ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE NOT BEING ENOUGH DOCTORS. ALSO THE RECOMMENDATION THAT IF YOU DO A LIST OF FIVE NAMES THAT THE PARTY WHO DIDN'T REQUEST THE PANEL SELECT THE DOCTOR WON'T WORK IT'S GOING TO PENALIZE THE INJURED WORKER HE WANTS TO MOVE THEIR CASE. IT'S GOING TO PENALIZE THE EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVE HE WANTS TO MOVE THE CASE ANY SUCH RECOMMENDATION TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THAT LEVEL. IS PREMATURE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IS THE ODYCH CORRECTLY SURMISES DELAYS HAVE REAL COST FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND THE INJURED WORKER. THE UNAVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY OF CUBIES OFTEN EXACERBATES THE CONDITION OF THE WORKER LEADING TO FURTHER. UP COMPLICATIONS AN ADDITIONAL MEDICAL NEEDS FROM DELAYS I'M GOING TO CLOSE WITH AN EXAMPLE FOR ONE OF OUR MEMBERS THAT IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN EXPRESSED HERE TODAY AND IT'S TYPICAL AND HAPPENS EVERY DAY. TO AN INJURED WORKER SO HERE'S THE CASE. A FORTY YEAR OL MALE MACHINE OPERATOR WAS A PLATE FOR THREE YEARS HE STARTED NOTICING PAIN AND NUMBNESS IN HIS HANDS. AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME BY HIS TREATING DOCTOR. HE FILED A CLAIM. THE CARRIER DECIDED TO DENY THE CLAIM AND GET IT Q. ME EVALUATION. THAT PROMPTED THE WORKER TO GO OUT AND GET AN ATTORNEY. THREE MONTHS LATER THE FIRST KILLING ME PANEL ISSUES. BUT THAT DOCTOR ISN'T SETTING FOR SEVEN MONTHS. SO THE CARRIER OBJECTS TO REQUEST REPLACEMENT PANEL. THE SECOND PANEL ISSUES SIX WEEKS LATER. BUT THAT DOCTOR ISN'T SETTING FOR FIVE MONTHS. SO THE DEFENDANT OBJECTS REQUEST ANOTHER REPLACEMENT PANEL SO WE GO ON TO THE THIRD PANEL. BUT THAT DOCTORS NO LONGER DOING EVALUATIONS AT THE ADDRESS ON THE PANEL SO YOU WON'T SCHEDULE LET THEM. HAVE TO GO TO A FOURTH PANEL. THE FOURTH PANEL ISSUES OCCUR AGAIN AND THE REMAINING DOCTORS SETTING BEHIND BEYOND THE NINETY DAYS. BUT NOW THE DEFENDANT AGREES TO WAIVE THE NINETY DAY DEADLINE BECAUSE THEY'VE GIVEN UP. THE EVALUATION SAT IT IS TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST EVALUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN SET. AND FENCE SO THEN IN THE MEANTIME THE INJURED WORKER. HAS BEEN OFF WORK. BIRD THREE YEAR STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE. OBTAIN CARPAL TUNNEL SURGERY ON HIS PRIVATE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE ALONG WITH OTHER TREATMENTS SUCH AS PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MJ STUDY ALONE BEHOLD AFTER THE CARPAL TUNNEL SURGERY HE'S RETURNED TO WORK AFTER ONE MONTH HE GOES BACK TO WORK AND HE'S STILL WAITING FOR THE REPORT FOR THAT Q. ANY EVALUATION WHICH IS THE ALL. OVER A YEAR AFTER THIS WHOLE PROCESS STARTED. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY. WE APPRECIATE THIS AUDIT AND WE HOPE IT WILL SPUR AND URGENT FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES BEYOND WHAT WAS DISCUSSED TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I MAKE ONE COMMENT QUICK. A QUICK COMMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL PANEL UNDER JUSTIN'S ARM ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH THAT EXAMPLE. IS ON THE CLAIM FORM YOU HAVE TO MARK DOWN WHETHER IT'S WORKERS COMP OR NOT IN ORDER TO GET YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS THROUGH GROUP INSURANCE. SO THAT EMPLOYEE WAS FORCED TO BASICALLY MISREPRESENTED THAT'S MY COMMENT. CUT CUT LET'S MOVE ON. I'M IS CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ELLEN LANDS ON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION INSTITUTE. SEE TO BE SEE I IS A NONPROFIT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES. OBJECTIVE. VIEWED PUBLIC POLICY STUDIES. THAT HAVE BEEN USED BY THE DATE OF YOU SEE THE D. I. R. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS GROUNDED IN SYSTEM WIDE DATA. AND NOT ANECDOTES OR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS. IN KEEPING WITH OUR MISSION TO IDENTIFY SYSTEM WIDE TRENDS THE INSTITUTE PRODUCED A RESEARCH REPORT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN ENTITLED CHANGES IN THE QUEUE ANY POPULATION. THAT REPORT WAS REFERENCED BY BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR IN HER REPORT AND BY THE DUE TO BE SEE AND ITS RESPONSE A COPY HAS BEEN INCLUDED FOR YOU TODAY ALONG WITH OUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY. OUR REPORT CONFIRMS THAT A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CARE MAYES HAS OCCURRED. BUT THAT DECREASE IS DUE TO MANY DIFFERENT REASONS IT'S NOT JUST LOW PAY. RETENTION OF CERTIFIED CAM IS MAY BE LINKED TO SOME QUEUE ARMIES FAILURE TO BE SELECTED THROUGH THE PANEL PROCESS. OUR DATA SHOWS THAT OF THOSE KILL MAYES WHO STOPPED PROVIDING SERVICES BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. 83% VOLUNTARILY DID NOT REVIEW WE KNEW THERE CAN BE CERTIFICATIONS. AND MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE PHYSICIANS WERE NOT ACTIVELY PERFORMING CURE ME EVALUATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. ONE EXPLANATION FOR THOSE CURE MAYES NOT BEING SELECTED BY THE PARTIES DURING THE PANEL PROCESS COULD BEAT THE POOR QUALITY OF THEIR REPORTS. IT IS THE INAUGURAL BALL IN ARE CURABLE GOAL. OF ALL SIDES PAYERS INJURED WORKERS CAN AMIR PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE A QUALITY FIRST REPORT. BUT THE NUMBER OF SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS THAT ARE ISSUED BY EVALUATORS HIGHLIGHTS THE INEFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM AS IT PRESENTLY EXISTS. LOOKING NEXT TO A REASON FOR THE DELAYS IN THE KILL ME APPOINTMENTS THE DATA POINT TO A NUMBER OF OFFICES. THAT EACH PROVIDER OPERATES FROM. YEARS AGO A FEW PROVIDERS WERE OPERATING OUT OF MORE THAN A DOZEN OFFICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THE RESULT THAT DOES PHYSICIANS REPLACED ON Q. ANY PANELS MORE OFTEN THAN PHYSICIANS WHO OPERATED OUT OF A SINGLE OFFICE. SO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN THE LAW CHANGED TO LIMIT TO TEN. THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS THAT EACH PROVIDER WOULD BE PERMITTED TO UTILIZE. BUT THE RESULT WAS THAT MORE PROVIDERS STARTED USING MULTIPLE OFFICES AND SENSE ONE PHYSICIAN CAN STILL WORK ONLY SO MANY HOURS IN A WEEK NO MATTER HOW MANY OFFICES THEY HAVE. THOSE PROVIDERS APPOINTMENT CALENDARS STARTED TO FILL UP FASTER. THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT CAUSED THE SYSTEM TO BE UNABLE TO MEET THE SIXTY DAY DEADLINE TO SET AN APPOINTMENT. WHICH IN TURN RESULTED IN AN INCREASED NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR REPLACEMENT PANELS. LASTLY WE WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR IN HER REPORT. THE AUDITOR'S FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE MED LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE BE REVIEWED AND UPDATED AT LEAST EVERY TWO YEARS IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THAT ANY MANDATE TO UPDATE TO THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE WOULD MEAN MODIFYING THE CODES AND THE RULES. AND THAT WOULD INVOKE THE FULL REGULATORY PROCESS IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THE AUDITOR INTENDED TO SUGGEST THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES BE UPDATED. TO THIS SENSITIVITY AYE RECOMMENDS THAT THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE RATES BE TIED DIRECTLY TO A VALID INFLATION INDEX SUCH AS THE MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEX REFERENCED BY MR PERSONAS WALL. THISWOULD OF FACILITATE REGULAR UPDATES THE ME I HAS ALREADY BEEN ADOPTED BY THE DATE OF YOU SEE AS A MEANS OF MAKING THEIR ANNUAL UPDATES. TO THE CONVERSION FACTOR FOR PHYSICIAN IN OPPOSITION- SERVICES. UNDER THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE. THE AUDITOR HAS FURTHER SUGGESTED THAT THE DELAYS CAUSED BY REPLACEMENT PANELS COULD BE REDUCED. BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF KILOMETERS ON THE PANELS FROM THREE TO FIVE IN REPRESENTED CASES. AS REFLECTED IN THE SEA TO BE SEE I REPORT IN FRONT OF YOU. THERE SIMPLY WILL NOT BE FIVE Q. M. IS AVAILABLE IN ANY BUT A FEW SPECIALTIES. GIVEN THE CURRENT POPULATION OF KIMI PROVIDERS THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF GETTING FIVE PROVIDERS IN MOST SPECIALTIES. OUR STUDY CONFIRMS THAT ACCESS TO Q. ARMIES IN THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY GREATLY IMPACTED BY LOCATION AND REQUESTED SPECIALTY. THE PROPOSED CHANGE MAY RESULT IN EVEN LARGER GEOGRAPHIC SEARCHES BY THE DUE TO BE SEE IN ORDER TO GENERATE A FULL PANEL PERHAPS HALF THE STATE IN SOME INSTANCES. ONE FINAL RECOMMENDATION. A PLAN TO ADJUST THE MED LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE IS LONG OVERDUE BUT SUCH REVISION WHETHER IT CONSISTS OF A 30% INCREASE OR A REIMBURSEMENT RATE. IT MUST ENCOMPASS A CHANGE TO THE OVERALL CURE ME PROCESS THAT INCLUDES A SPECIFIC PATH TOWARDS BETTER QUALITY REPORTS. ON BEHALF OF THE MEMBERS OF CITY BCI WE THINK COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THESE COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK OF A NUMBER OF ROLES ON THEPRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY WHICH IS POSITION TO TREAT AND EVALUATE INJURED WORKERS. I'M ACUMEN MAY. READING PHYSICIAN AND I'M THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR LARGE MEDICAL GROUP. AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AS WELL. ONE WITH MANY OF THE MY COLLEAGUES HERE. NIGHT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE WAY THE WC AND FORCES OR FAILED TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO TREAT OR EVALUATE PATIENTS AND THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE ABILITY OF PATIENTS TO RECEIVE TREATMENT OR AN EVALUATION. CENTER ROTH EARLY REST OF THE DECREASE IN TREAING PHYSICIANS- AND CUMAE POSITIONS RELATED TO THE STATE SHORTAGE OF A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND NO IT'S NOT POSITIONS- OUR FAMILY PRACTICE DOCTORS THEIR INTERNIST- BUT- THEY DON'T USUALLY TREAT INJURED WORKERS- THAT'S UNUSUAL- MOST. PRIMATE MOST PRIMARY TREATING PHYSICIANS THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM OR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS PAIN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS AND OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE MEDICINE PHYSICIANS AND THE NUMBER OF THOSE POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO. TREAT INJURED WORKERS HAS BEEN DWINDLING WHEN I STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE EVERY ORTHOPEDIST I KNOW WAS HAPPY TO GET TREAT AN INJURED WORKER. AND NOW- THE CHURCH INTO THAT I WOULD GO TO PERSONALLY FOR TREATMENT WON'T TAKE AN INJURED WORKER ANYMORE THE ONLY WANT TO TREAT PRIVATE INSURANCE PATIENTS. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. THE W. C. REFUSES TO CERTIFY MPA ENDS AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE TOPIC THIS MEETING BUT I MENTION AMBIENCE BECAUSE- THAT SORT OF. IT'S AN EXAMPLE HOW THE T. W. C. APPROACHES ISSUES IT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE OVERALL CULTURE THE W. C. APPROACHING THESE WORKERS COMPENSATION ISSUES WE RECENTLY CALLED ON EVERY PAIN MANAGEMENT POSITION IN THE MPN OF A LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY THE A TUTOR TWENTY NINE POSITIONS IN THE ENTIRE STATE WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THEIR PANEL TO TREAT INJURED WORKERS ONLY SEVEN POSITIONS OF THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY NINE. WERE AVAILABLE TO SEE A PATIENT IN TWO WEEKS THAT'S REQUIRED BY LAW TAT THEY HAVE THREE POSITIONS IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA AVAILABLE TO SEE PATIENTS WITHIN TWO WEEKS THEIR MPN HAD SEVEN PATIENTS FOR THE WHOLE STATES 50% OF THE POSITIONS ON THAT PANEL WERE NO LONGER SEEING INJURED WORKERS THEY WOULDN'T TREAT THEM AND ANOTHER POSITIONS WERE ONLY WILLING TO TREAT SPECIFIC DIAGNOSES BUT THE D. W. C. WAS UNWILLING TO LOOK AT THAT- THAT MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK. AND DECERTIFY IT THERE THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY DO NOT REVIEW- MPA ENDS THIS PATTERN IS REPEATED IN THE D. W. C. APPROACH TO Q. AMIS IF YOU GO TO CURE ME CONFERENCE YOU'LL SEE THE AVERAGE AGE OF SIXTY PLUS. FIVE ALL OF MY PARTNERS ALL OF MY CITY TO YOUNGER THAN ME OF THE TWELVE COLLEAGUES THAT WERE Q. IN THE SIX HAVE GIVEN UP THEIR CERTIFICATES BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY CONSIDERED INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT AND THE TO COMPLICATED THE SYSTEM I'VE TWO PARTNERS WHO STILL DOCUMENTS BECAUSE I BEG THEM TO STAY ON THE PANELS THE ONLY SEE TO CURE ME SOME MONTH THAT'S ALL THAT THEY WANT TO SEE OKAY. I PERFORM TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR VALUATIONS PER MONTH AND I'M OFF THE PANELS AT LEAST TEN MONTHS A YEAR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MY NAME TO COME UP ON A PANEL AND FOR ME TO BE UNAVAILABLE AND SO I SCHEDULE ALL THE PATIENTSWERE CALL ME FOR PANEL I NEVER TURN ANYBODY DOWN SOMEONE CALLS ME THINK MY NAME CAME UP ON THE TIMES THAT AMONG THE PANELS TO SEE THEM. BUT I TRY TO TAKE MYSELF OFF AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE I AM INVITE XIN OF THE OF THE BWC REGULATIONS I DO THAT I'M ALLOWED TO BE OFF THREE MONTHS. IF I DIDN'T GO UP TEN MONTHS. I BE BOOKED UP I BE BOOKED UP A YEAR AGO AT THIS STAGE OF MY CAREER I'M JUST NOT WILLING TO WORK ANY HARDER THAN THAT OKAY THERE IS NO LARGE POOL OF UNDER UTILIZED CUMAE IS TO DO THE BOOK MAJORITY OF THESE EVALUATIONS THERE ARE VERY FEW ORTHOPEDIC- PAIN MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES WHO WANT MORE CUMAE WORK DOCTORS ACTUALLY PREFER TO TREAT PATIENTS AND INADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT REALLY DOESN'T MAKE THEM WANT TO WORK AS CUNY'S. I CAN TELL YOU THE REAL ISSUE FOR MANY OF THESE EVALUATIONS YOU CAN GET SIX HOURS WORTH OF WORK THAT YOU HAVE TO. KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO DO AND YOU'LL BE PAID SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CURRENT REGULATIONS WORK. AT A HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR YOU CAN'T RUN A MEDICAL OFFICE IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE. AND SO NO EVERY TIME SOMEBODY GETS ONE OF THOSE EVALUATIONS NO THEY'RE VERY UNHAPPY IT MAKES THEM WANT TO DROP OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND ALSO WANTS TO MAKE THE GAME THE SYSTEM. AND WITH THE D. W. C. DID WAS IGNORE THE FACT THAT. THAT THAT MANY EVALUATIONS PAID THIS INCREDIBLY LOW RATE AND THEY TRY TO INVESTIGATE PEOPLE WHO THEY THOUGHT WERE CHARGING TOO MUCH. WIRE QB'S IMPORTANT ONE EXAMPLE- I RECENTLY EVALUATED YOUNG MAN WORKING AS A PAINTER HE FELT TWENTY FOUR EIGHT FEET OFF THE SCAFFOLD FRACTURES ARMY LOST CONSCIOUSNESS WOKE UP IN THE HOSPITAL A FEW DAYS. I SAW HIS ACUMEN SIXTEEN MONTHS AFTER HIS INJURY WHY SIXTEEN MONTHS BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH THIS PANEL PROCESS ONE PANEL AFTER ANOTHER BEING INADEQUATE. WHY DID I SEE HIM GET A TORN ROTATOR CUP. THE THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS REFUSING TO AUTHORIZE- TREATMENT FOR HIS OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN JUST DIDN'T RECORD THAT HE WAS COMPLAINING OF SHOULDER PAIN- TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTER HIS INJURY. WHEN HE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER DOCTOR THEY RECORDED AT THREE MONTHS. BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANY THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO LATE. THIS IS A YOUNG MAN WAS A ROOFER HE WAS HE OBSERVE PAINTER HE WAS HE WAS. DID HEAVY WORK YET TO CARRY BUCKETS OF PAINT HEAT SET UP SCAFFOLDS HE OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAVE A ROTATOR CUFF TEAR. ANY FELL TWENTY FEET OFF THE SCAFFOLD KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS FRACTURED HIS ARM CLEARLY THIS WAS A WORK INJURY BUT HE COULDN'T GET THAT TREATED. UNTIL HE SAW ME. THAT DELAYING TREATMENT COST HIM DEARLY. NEW THIS THE SYSTEM IS REALLY BROKEN. UP THERE HAS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE WAY THE GW SEE VIEWS ITS ROLES ORGANISED INCREASING PROBLEMS IN EVERY ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM. WE NEED HELP FROM THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THE D. W. C. ACTUALLY ENFORCES THE REGULATIONS ARE PRESENT. AND TRY TO IDENTIFY AND SOLVE PROBLEMS THE COLLABORATIVE FASHION. SO WITHOUT THIS CHAIN TO THE D. W. C. APPROACH THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE INCREASING COST INJURED WORKERS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. THE GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS DOCTOR GOOD WERE VERY I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY IN ADDITION I AM CEO AND CO FOUNDER OF CALIFORNIA MEDICAL EVALUATORS WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXAMINATION COMPANY BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND WE MANAGE THE PRACTICES OF OVER A HUNDRED Q. EMMYS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO FOR REQUESTING THE AUDIT AS WELL AS UP MS HOWL FOR THE FANTASTIC WORK THAT SHE AND HER TEAM- PUT TOGETHER. BEFORE I GO INTO MY PREPARED COMMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE COME UP DURING THE QUESTIONING NUMBER ONE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES THAT SIMPLY DON'T EXIST- IN THE QUEUE NB SYSTEM DUE TO A LACK OF FIVE PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU ARE INJURED WORKER WHO IS SUFFERING FROM A SEVERE INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROBLEM YOU CANNOT BE EVALUATED BY Q. ME WHY THERE ARE ZERO INFECTIOUS DISEASE Q. AMIS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU HAVE AN OBGYN ISSUE YOU CANNOT HAVE THANK YOU IN THE EVALUATION THERE IS ONE IN CALIFORNIA AND AS MS WORLEY INDICATED IF YOU COME DOWN WITH CANCER THAT MAY BE RELATED TO WORK YOU CANNOT HAVE I'M COLLEGE OF VALUATION THERE ARE ONLY THREE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO UNDER UTILIZED POOL OF PHYSICIANS TO EVALUATE ONCOLOGY ISSUES OBGYN ISSUES WERE INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES. THE REASON THAT SO MANY Q. AMIS DO NOT RECEIVE EVALUATIONS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE DEMAND FOR Q. ME SERVICES ON A SPECIALTY BASIS AND THE QUEUE ME POPULATION ON A SPECIALTY BASIS 54% OF Q. ANY REQUESTS OR IN THE ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALTY AS INDICATED IN THE CWC AYE REPORT FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ONLY ORTHOPEDIST'S ORTHOPEDIST'S ARE VASTLY UNDERREPRESENTED. THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN LOWER PAYING SPECIALITIES CHIROPRACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE. VASTLY OVER REPRESENTED RELATIVE TO THEIR DEMAND THERE IS NO TWEAKING TO THE ALGORITHM THAT WILL GIVE UNDER UTILIZED PSYCHOLOGISTS MORE WORK THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU THE EXTREME DIFFICULTIES THE CUBAN PHYSICIANS HAVE HAD DEALING WITH THE CURRENT TWC ADMINISTRATION FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. BUT BEFORE I'D LIKE BEFORE I DO THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION THE IRONY THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS OCCURRING AT A HEARING. SOMETHING WHICH TWC REFUSED TO PROVIDE TO COUNTLESS Q. AMIS WHICH IT WRONGFULLY KICKED OUT OF THE SYSTEM. IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN DOZENS OF OUR PHYSICIANS WERE AUDITED BY D. W. C. AND WERE ALTERNATELY DENIED REAPPOINTMENT BY DOCTOR MEISTER. ALL OF THE DENIAL LETTERS WERE BOILER PLATE AND ACCUSED THE DOCTORS OF OVERBILLING AND VIOLATING THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE. NO DOCTORS WERE ACCUSED OF FRAUD OR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE. THE DOCTORS APPEALED THE DENIALS TIMELY. ONLY THEN TO RECEIVE A BOILER PLATE LEGAL DOCUMENT ENTITLED A STATEMENT OF ISSUES. ALL OF WHICH UPHELD THE DENIALS ALL WERE SIGNED BY MR PART PARRIS SOTO AND WERE CARBON COPIED ON THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD. THE DOCTORS WENT ON TO PROVIDE HEARING OR TO REQUEST HEARINGS THE DOCTORS REQUESTED THE TWC PROVIDE HEARINGS THE HEARINGS WERE NEVER PROVIDED. IN MISTER PURSUED HIS RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT HE STATED THAT WHEN THEY DENIED Q. ME SUBMITTED A FORM ENTITLED REQUEST. FOR HEARING. THE WC DID NOT PROVIDE HEARING. ONLY AFTER MR ROXBURGH GOT INVOLVED IN LITIGATION ENSUED AND JUDGE SHALL FONT IN LOS ANGELES ORDERED THAT THE D. W. C. PROVIDE HEARINGS WITHIN NINETY DAYS D. W. C. OF EVENTUALLY AGREED TO REINSTATE THE PHYSICIANS THIS WAS AFTER MUCH TIME AND COST TO NOT ONLY THE PHYSICIANS BUT UP PEOPLE TO THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF INJURED WORKERS WHOSE EVALUATIONS WERE NEEDLESSLY CANCELED. OR DELAYED. MANY IN THE QUEUE OF ME COMMUNITY HAD HOPED THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THIS LAWSUIT IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. WOULD PUT AN END TO THIS MATTER. IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN D. W. C. ISSUED A PROPOSAL TO UPDATE THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE AS MR PARRIS OF INDICATED THEY DID PUT SOME WORK INTO ATTEMPTING TO UPDATE THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROPOSAL SOUGHT TO CODIFY THE VERY UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WHICH TWC HAD JUST AGREED TO STOP ENFORCING IN SETTLEMENT DOCUMENTS. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE DECIMATED Q. AND THE REIMBURSEMENT A PUBLIC OUTCRY FROM CUBA MUEZZIN SUED AND D. W. C. EVENTUALLY SHELVE THE PROPOSAL. SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN SYSTEMS HAS MET WITH MISTER PARIS SOTO AND HIS STAFF AND REQUESTED AN INCREASE TO THE CURRENT Q. ON THE FEE SCHEDULE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. NO ADJUSTMENT WAS EVER PROVIDED IT'S BEEN FOURTEEN YEARS FOURTEEN YEARS WITH NO CALL INCREASE YET TWC EMPLOYEES GET REGULAR INCREASES AND THEIR WAGES. WHY SHOULD Q. AMIS WORK FOR THE SAME RATE AT THE SAME RATE. FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AS THE AUDITOR CLEARLY IDENTIFIED MANY Q. AMIS HAVE ALREADY VOTED WITH THEIR FEET AND THEY HAVE A BAND IN THE SYSTEM. IN JULY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE BILL SPONSORED BY C. SIMS AUTHORED BY CHAIRMAN SALAS AS WELL AS A SIMPLY ASSEMBLY WOMAN GOMEZ REYES. WAS INTRODUCED THE BILL SEEKS TO ADJUST Q. ANY REIMBURSEMENT TO CATCH UP FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS AND WOULD REQUIRE. THAT TWC UPDATE THE FEE SCHEDULE FOR INFLATION GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT SITUATION NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN A FEW WEEKS AFTER AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO WAS INTRODUCED THE WC ONCE AGAIN PROPOSED A CHANGE TO THE FEE SCHEDULE. THIS FEE SCHEDULE ALSO WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY SLASH REIMBURSEMENT TO CUBA MEETS THIS LATEST PROPOSAL SEEKS TO TAKE AWAY Q. EMMYS ABILITY TO BILL AT AN HOURLY RATE AND INSTEAD ONLY BILL A FLAT FEE. WE SURVEYED THE COMMUNITY THE QUEUE ANY COMMUNITY AND FOUND THAT IF TWC IS PROPOSED FEE SCHEDULE WERE ADOPTED THAN 85% OF Q. ARMIES WOULD EITHER QUIT THE SYSTEM. OR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR QUEUE ME PRACTICE. THE PROPOSED FEE SCHEDULE IS BASED ON THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE OF NEVADA HOWEVER THE FEES WHICH TWC HAS SUGGESTED ARE 62% LESS THAN THOSE ALLOWED FOR IN NEVADA. THIS IS ODD GIVEN THAT CALIFORNIA IS A MUCH HIGHER COST OF LIVING STATE THE NEVADA AND Q. ANY EXAMINATIONS ARE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN ABOUT EVALUATIONS IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAPPENED WE SUBMITTED A P. R. A REQUEST TO WC WE REQUESTED ALL CORRESPONDENCE D. W. C. HAS HAD OUTSIDE OF THE AGENCY RELATED TO THE MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE. WE OBTAIN SUBMISSIONS FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHICH DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FEE SCHEDULE WHICH TWC PROPOSED CAME DIRECTLY FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS MEANWHILE A FEW SCHEDULE WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY C. SIMS WHICH HAD GARNERED OVER TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SIGNATURES IN SUPPORT FROM THE QUEUE IN THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH WE HAVE PRESENTED TO MISTER PARIS SOTO PRIOR TO AUGUST. WAS IGNORED BY THE WC. THIS CAN BE FIXED AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED IT IS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT WE THE QUEUE UP MUSIC CALIFORNIA PLEAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO INTERVENE AND DIRECT THE AGENCY TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES NECESSARY. TO SAVE THE QUEUE IN THE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE INJURED WORKERS WITH THE TIMELY AND QUALITY MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATIONS THEY DESERVE C. SIMS BELIEVE THAT AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO IS A NECESSARY A VITAL STEP TOWARDS THAT GOAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. PERSONAL TESTIMONY PLEASE YOU ARE. I CAME WITH PREPARED REMARKS AND THEN LISTENING TO ALL OF THE CONVERSATIONS HAVING READ THE AUDIT ONE TO GIVE LOW BACKGROUND AND COMMENTARY AND PUT EVERYTHING IN CONTEXT MY NAME'S NICK ROXBOROUGH WATCH FOR PARTS NINETY DRAWN A WE ARE EMPLOYERS RIGHTS LAW FIRM. I KNOW PRETTY MUCH ALL THE PLAYERS IN THIS ROOM. THE CHAIRS SAID. THAT HE UNDERSTANDS IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE CURE ME. SENATOR ROTH YOU ASKED WIRE Q. AMIS NOT COMING IN. WE HEARD ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND WE HEARD IT D. W. C. TALK AT LEAST ELEVEN TIMES ABOUT THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS. THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION FILED. BY THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER IN THE CARRIERS THAT SAID THIS IS PREMATURE I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS IT IS NOT PREMATURE AT THE TIME IS NOW. SO LET ME PROVIDE A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN. I GOT PHONE CALLS FROM QUALIFIED MEDICAL EXAMINERS I SPECIALIZED IN REPRESENTING BUSINESSES AND WORKERS COMP. THE Q. AMIS ALL HAD THE SAME STORY. ONE OF THE PANEL MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL TO THE Q. MEANS GET PAID IF THE REPORTS ARE UP HELP THAT WAS A GREAT QUESTION. BUT WE NEED TO CLARIFY. EVERYONE OF MY CLIENTS AND BY THE WAY TO DATE I HAVE OVER ONE HUNDRED CURE ME CLIENTS. THEIR STORIES ARE IDENTICAL THEY WERE ALL PAID AT THE W. CA BE THE CARRIERS AND THE SELF INSURED EMPLOYERS PAID THEIR BILLS AND PAID THE REPORTS. DIDN'T QUESTION IT BUT THEY HAVE A REMEDY THAT NOBODY SPOKE ABOUT HERE THEY CAN GO TO THE I. B. R. AT THE WCPO IN DISPUTE. THEY WHEN THEY WHEN. BUT INSTEAD HERE'S WHAT I LEARNED AND I THOUGHT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME TO SHARE WITH YOU I'M READING STEVE SCHWARZMAN SUPPORT THE CO BLACKSTONE GROUP AND WHAT IT TAKES AND HE QUOTED LAWCENTER READ POLITICIANS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WERE JUST PEOPLE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS IF YOU CAN HELP. YOU SHOULD. SO I'M HOPING TO HELP AND PUT SOMETHING IN CONTEXT. WHY ARE Q. MISLEADING THE SYSTEM IT WAS A REAL SIMPLE IN AUGUST TO SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM. THEY WERE BEING AFTER BEING PAID BY THE CARRIERS THE D. W. C. AND THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAD ADEQUATE STAFFING. THE TWC WAS TO PUT IT BLUNTLY HARASSING CUNY'S. ON WHAT WERE CALLED I CALLED UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. THIS WAS THEIR INTERPRETATION. THEY SAID THEIR INTERPRETATION OF REGULATIONS THAT IT EXISTED FOR DECADES AND ALSO AND THEY WERE PLAYING A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND SOME THE DOCTORS CAME TO MEAN SAID NECK AM I DOING THIS WHAT I HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY I SAID NO THE STATUTE HASN'T CHANGED THEY'RE TAKING OUT THE WORD AND THEN PUT IN THE WORK ORDER. FOR MAKING MATERIAL CHANGES THOSE ROCKER GROUND REGULATIONS. THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT BRINGING AN OLDER CUBIES INTO THE PROCESS I APOLOGIZE TO FORGET WHICH MEMBER ASKED WHY CAN'T WE GET SOME OF THOSE FOLKS BACK CAN'T. MY FIRST YES MY FIRST POINT WAS DR HOWARD. EIGHTY YEARS OLD. BEEN IN THE QUEUE IN THE SYSTEM FOR TEN YEARS GOT REAPPOINTED EVERY TWO YEARS LIKE CLOCKWORK. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS ATTACKED HE WASN'T DOING IT RIGHT. ALMOST THE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME WAS CURE ME WORK. NOBODY EVER ACCUSED ANY OF MY CLIENTS OF. WORKERS COMP FRAUD NONE OF THE CURE MAYES OVER HUNDRED MINE. WERE EVER ACCUSED THE MALPRACTICE IT WITH BILLING INTERPRETATION THAT'S WHAT THE D. WC HAS BEEN SPENDING WITH A LACK OF RESOURCES. DOCTOR HOWARD LEFT THE SYSTEM HE WON. HE WON THE WRIT OF MANDAMUS THAT I WON FOR THE CHURCH CHAO FAN AND HE SAID NICK I'M DONE. I DON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE. TO BE CLEAR I DON'T THINK WITH ALL DUE RESPECT ALGORITHMS WE NEED ALGORITHMS TO KNOW WHY CUNY'S HAVE LEFT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT A HUNDRED AND EIGHT CUNY'S HAVE TOLD ME AND THEN SOME. I'M WORKING AT TWO HUNDRED AND SIX WAITERS. AND A BEING HASSLED BY THE WC ON STUFF THAT DOESN'T EXIST I'M OUT. I'M OUT EUROPEAN ALGORITHM TO TELL YOU THAT I AM PRETTY SURE THE BWC DOES NEED A COMMITTEE THEY DON'T GET A COMMISSION THEY COULD TALK AT ANY POINT IN TIME I'D MAKE MIKE HUNDRED EIGHT KIM IS AVAILABLE TO TALK TO WE DON'T NEED TO. WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IT IS SOMETIMES THAT SIMPLE. AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO STATE SOLUTION 50% OUR ONLINE HEALTH REPORTED 30% THEY BOTH WERE SAYING THE SAME THING. EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WHAT'S SOMETHING SO WHY YES NO ALGORIHM YOU NEED A RACE. WE'LL GET RAISES. THE CARRIERS OF THEIR OPPOSITION SAID THIS IS PREMATURE INFANTS COMPLEX NO WHAT'S NOT IT TAKES FOURTEEN YEARS TO GIVE A COLA INCREASE I'M SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WONDERING HOW TO TAKE FOURTEEN YEARS TO GIVE A CALL INCREASED I THINK IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. LABOR CODE SECTION FIFTY THREE OH SEVEN POINT SIX REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR. TO ADOPTING REVIEW FEE SCHEDULE FOR MEDICAL LEGAL EXPENSES IT ANYWAY. THEY'RE NOW PROPOSING EVERY TWO YEARS. MY COLLEAGUE ON MY LEFT FROM CWC AYE SHE'S RIGHT THIS TO YOUR ISSUE IS NOT WHAT THE STATUTE PROVIDES. THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THE TWC IS UPDATED FEE SCHEDULES SEVEN TIMES. THEY JUST DID ONE ON DECEMBER TWELFTH BUT NOT FOR Q. ARMIES. THESE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS BECAUSE TO TWENTY FIVE PAGE RULINGS FROM JUDGE CHAO FAN ON RICHMOND AMOS. TO SUPPORT THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WERE DENIED. ONE OF MY CLIENTS I WON'T MENTION HIS NAME. BUT I WILL ALLUDE TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE PRIVATELY. HE WAS DENIED DUE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR HEARING AND JUDGE HEALTH AND SAID TO THE WC YOU GOTTA GET MY HEARING. HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE REAPPOINTED HE'S A CARDIOLOGISTS. HIGHLY EDUCATED. IT'S MY PERSONAL CAUGHT CARDIOLOGISTS. HE'S A REALLY GOOD. BUT HE COULDN'T BE IN THERE. WHEN WE SETTLED FINALLY. HE TO NO MONEY. AND THEY PAID BACK FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS PART OF THE SADDAM. BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ALL THE CUNY'S AND WHAT REALLY HAPPENED YOU HAD THE WHITE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. IN SOMEBODY ASKED THE QUESTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE% CHAIR. WHAT ABOUT THE STAFF WHO'S THAT YOU KEEP YOUR AND WE NEED TO DO THIS WE NEED TO DO THAT. I'LL TELL YOU THE ONLY TO FOLKS. WE'RE DOING ANYTHING ON THE SUBJECT ARE THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS THAT'S MISTER WINSLOW WEST. AND THE COR RICHARDSON. TO WORKERS COMP DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WHO USED TO WORK AT STATE COMPENSATION INSURANCE FUND THEY WROTE THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS THEY WENT AFTER EVERYONE OF MY CLIENTS AND HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED I WAS STUNNED THE NOTICES OUT WORK. THEY WOULD SAY LISTEN YOU DON'T FOLLOW THESE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WE WOULD ARGUE MY CLIENTS HAD A REALLY TOUGH CALL ISSUE THERE OKAY- EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET REAPPOINTED. MY FEES FOR SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED. I GIVE MYSELF A RACE FOUR YEARS AGO OKAY. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO SO WE CUT A DEAL AND THEN WITH THE D. WC SAYS IS YOU GET A LETTER FROM THEM AND SAYS OKAY WILL TAKE NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS THREE THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE TO A I G. MAKE A CHECK THREE THOUSAND STATE FUND. AND THREE THOUSAND IS AN- THEY TOOK THE COLLECTION WORK. THEY DID THE COLLECTION WORK FOR THE CARRIERS WERE ALREADY PAID THE BILLS AND HAD NO PROBLEMS I DON'T NEED AN ALGORITHM TO TELL ME. THAT'S NOT RIGHT. SO WHEN THE CARRIERS ROAD IN THEIR OPPOSITION LETTER YESTERDAY. THAT THIS IS GOING TO COST MONEY THE RIGHT TIME I CAN GET THE DID YOU SEE TO WORK FOR THEM ANYMORE. NOW WHEN I HAD THE UNDERGROUND REGULATION BATTLE. IT WAS MY FIRM TOLL FOURTEEN HOURS A TWO WARS IN THIS CASE THE WC HAD NO PROBLEM PUTTING ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL OF CASE. THREE LAWYERS FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THREE LAWYERS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SIX LAWYERS FIGHTING TO DEFEND UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS AND ONLY WHEN I HAD A OUR LAWN HEARING FOR JUDGE CHERTOFF AND IT SHOWED THE WITH THE RULE FOR SARAH. DID THEY SAY OKAY WE QUIT. BUT THE CULTURE HASN'T CHANGED. ALAIN HELL IS COME UP WITH A SPECTACULAR FAIR MINDED AUDIT CHIEF HIT ON THE HEAD SHE HIT THE ISSUES OF SHORTAGE OF CURE MEETS. THE PRACTICE FOR DISCIPLINE CUNY'S MIGHT KILL ME CLASS ROLE DISCIPLINE FOR THE WRONG REASONS COULD GET HEARING THEY SAID THEY COULD GET A HEARING EVENTUALLY I WAS ABLE THROUGH DEPOSITION TESTIMONY TO POINT OUT THAT MISTER WEST IS THE ONLY ONE WHO GIVES. DUE PROCESS HEARINGS. TO HEARING SECURITIES IN THREE YEARS. SO EITHER THE PWC HAS A HUGE STAFFING SHORTAGE. BUT THOSE SIX FOUR TO OPPOSE ME THEY DON'T GET INVOLVED HERE. SO LET'S MOVE FAST FORWARD WE HAVE ALL THESE MEETINGS THAT ALL THE FOLKS TO TESTIFY TO HEAR. THERE'S NO AGREEMENT WERE NOT EVEN IN THE BALLPARK. THE CURE ME FOR THE UMPIRES. WE HAVE MORE BASEBALL GAMES TO PLAY THAT WE HAVE UMPIRES SO BASEBALL GAMES ARE PLAYED FANSEDGE MONEY GETS SPENT IN CUBA IS AN UMPIRE TWENTY WARM PERSON GAME THANK YOU PAY MORE MONEY THEY COME. BUT YOU GOT ALSO PRODUCED THE HASSLE. CHEST ON DECEMBER TWELFTH LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THAT THE CULTURE HAS NOT CHANGED BECAUSE MY FIFTEEN TODAY FROM LISTEN EVERYTHING READING EVERYTHING IS. GIVEN A FAIR WAGE 3050% AND STOP THE CULTURE. I GOT MY HUNDRED SEVEN CLIENT I THINK CURE ME. AND E SAYS HEY I'M A PSYCHOLOGIST AND I GOT A LETTER FROM ONE OF THESE TWO LAWYERS. AND THE COMPLAINT MYSTERONS PRO IS. I DID MEET WITH THE PATIENT FOR ONE HOUR AND SO THEY GOT AUDITED WAITING TO MEET WITH THE PATIENT. FOR AN HOUR. TWEET THE HIRE ME TO EXPLAIN. TO ONE OF THOSE TWO LAWYERS WHO WROTE THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WERE RUNNING ALL THESE MEETINGS. BECAUSE THE PATIENT LEFT. SHE SAID SHE WAS IN SO MUCH PAIN AFTER FIFTEEN MINUTES BECAUSE OF A BACK SHE'S LIKE I'M TERRIBLY SORRY DOC BUT I KELLY. AND I'M OUT OF HERE NOW. THAT WAS DECEMBER TWELFTH OF LAST MONTH. WHY IS THE DELIVERY SEIZE PENDING VALUABLE RESOURCES AUDITING A PSYCHOLOGIST. ON THAT POINT. AND WHAT IS THE PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE TO HIRE NICK ROXBOROUGH. WHEN THIS ALL GETS FIX I'M REPRESENTED CUNY'S ANYMORE HE ALSO ALL LOSE BUSINESS BUT WHAT'S FAIR IS FAIR EVERYONE HERE KNOWS THE INJURED WORKER. IS THE PERSON WHO WE CARE ABOUT OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WE HAD A GREAT COMPROMISE PLAYERS MAKE THAT. CHANGE RIGHT WE SAID WE WILL TRADE NO CIVIL SUITS FOR NO FAULT SYSTEM. THIS IS BEEN RIDDLED THE SYSTEM AND HERE'S WHAT'S WHAT'S REALLY MISSING SOMEBODY ASKED ABOUT. THE LABOR SECRETARY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SENATE ROTH FOR CENTER MORAL A MORE A MORE LACK. AND. SEC LABOR SECRETARY JULIE SU IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. THERE'S NO BOX FOR THE WC SOMEBODY ATHLETIC WAS ALSOCENTER MORLOCK WHO'S RUNNING THE SHOW HERE THEY REPORTED THAT THE I. R. THERE'S NO DIRECTOR. CHOOSE TO THE LABOR SECRETARY DIDN'T COMMENT ON A REPORT ON THE TWC THIS IS A HUGE DEAL HAVEN'T TRACTION OVER THIRTY YEARS THIS IS A BIG DEAL YOUR SITTING ON A POWER CáC. THIS IS A POWDER KEG MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. THIS IS A POTENTIAL COLLAPSE OF THE SYSTEM. NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATIONS ARE BUT WE NEED TO GET THOSE FOLKS INVOLVED I MEAN THAT'S WHAT THIS PERSON'S JOB ISN'T I THOUGHT WE WOULD SEE MITSU HERE. TALK ABOUT THE AUDIT. YOU WANT TO TALK FINALLY ABOUT THE IMPACT. ON THE INJURED WORKER CAL MATTERS JUST DID A ARTICLE YESTERDAY. WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH CAL MATTERS THEY CALLED ME UP BY HOW CAN BE QUOTED ALONG WITH MISTER OR IN OTHERS. THEY TALKED ABOUT DURING FORTY ELLIS. AND THE IMPACT THAT SHE'S HAD. TO GO THROUGH BECAUSE CAN'T GET ACUMEN. AWFUL AND REMEMBER MY CLIENT D. CARDIOLOGISTS WHO GOT ATTACKED ON THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. IT WAS THE CASE HE TOLD ME ABOUT. WHERE BECAUSE THERE WERE NO CARDIOLOGISTS. HIS WORK TALK ABOUT MISTER OF OUR TALK ABOUT NO CARDIOLOGISTS HE WAS SELECTED ON COLLEGES HE BECAME THE CARDIOLOGISTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY YOU SEE HE WAS BEING ATTACKED ON THE UNDERGROUND REGULATION SO HE NEVER GOT REAPPOINTED SO GUESS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CLIENT. HE WAS REMOVED FROM CUMAE PANEL. THE HORRIBLE STORY WAS THE INJURED WORKER EVENTUALLY PASSED AWAY. LET'S GO FIX THE SYSTEM I APPRECIATE THE TIME. THANK YOU. RIGHT LET'S GO TO THE WRONG. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY AND THE TIME THAT IT TOOK YOU ALL TO PREPARE AND TO BE HERE AND TO GIVE US VALUABLE INFORMATION I I'VE- OBVIOUSLY. FEE INCREASES I'M ALL FOR THAT I THINK. THIS CERTAINLY IS A ELEMENT OF UNDER COMPENSATION IS A INDICATED BEFORE IN THIS AND OTHER AREAS. IN TERMS OF THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS I MEAN I'VE CERTAINLY WORK THIS GENERAL ISSUE FOR THE GOING ON EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN UP HERE AND- I WOULD I HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN TOLD BY THOSE OF THOSE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE BUSINESS SAID DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S MORE THAN JUST A SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS A SHORTAGE OF SPECIALTY CARE PHYSICIANS AS WELL. WHETHER IT'S ORTHOPEDIST'S AROUND COLLEGES TO WHATEVER AND SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FERRET OUT FROM THE TESTIMONY WHAT THE FIX SERIOUS. AND ASSUMING WE'RE ABLE TO MUSCLE THROUGH SOME FEE INCREASE AT WHATEVER LEVEL 50% MY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH MONEY IS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO- ASSURE TIMELY ACCESS TO Q. AMIS ON THESE PANELS AND PEOPLE WHO YOU CAN'T FIND A QUEUE IN MAY TO PROVIDE A REPORT ANALYSIS WITHIN NINETY DAYS OR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OR A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. HOW MUCH MONEY IS REQUIRED FOR THE HOW MUCH MONEY IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ONCOLOGISTS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALISTS IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF ORTHOPEDIST'S. ANALYSTS AROUND THE STATE SO WE CAN HAVE INJURED WORKERS PARTICULARLY WHERE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IS WHETHER THERE THERE IS WORK RELATED THIS. TO THE PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT PROCESS DOESN'T BEGIN CLAIMS ADMINISTRATORS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PROCEED UNTIL THAT ISSUE IS DECIDED. AND SO IF I DON'T HAVE AN ONCOLOGIST- I DON'T HAVE AN INSPECTION INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALISTS OR AN ORTHOPEDIST TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION THEN WHAT HAPPENS. SO I HAVEN'T HEARD AN ANSWER TO THAT HERE. I'M HOPING AT SOME POINT I'LL HEAR AN ANSWER I'M YOU'VE YOU'VE GOT A SUPPORTER IN TERMS OF FEE INCREASES BUT I'M JUST NOT. THE DOT STARK BEING AREN'T CONNECTED SO IF WE APPROVE A 50% FEE INCREASES SUING WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO OR GOING TO BE BACK HERE IN TWELVE MONTHS. HAVING PEOPLE TALK TO US ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF Q. IN THESE ON THE PANEL. THE THEY ARE UNAVAILABLE. CAN SOMEBODY RESPOND TO THAT. SENATE ROTH I CERTAINLY CAN THE FEE INCREASE IS GREAT IT WILL HELP IT WILL HELP THOSE. DOCTORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING SERVICE FOR SURE ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING AND WHO HAVE STAYED OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE FEE ISSUE. BUT IS MISSED PERSONA REFERENCE TO HAS OUR REPORT ALSO REFERENCES. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THEY INCREASE THE FEES AND NOT THAT MUCH HAPPENED. THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS PARTLY INCREASE THE FEES BUT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM CAN SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN IN IN FIVE MINUTES MUCH LESS AN HOUR- I CAN TELL YOU. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A LONG TIME KIMBERLY AND WE SHOULD HAVE IT SO THAT'S THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM IS WHAT KEEPS DOCTORS OUT ITS WHAT. FRUSTRATES THE EMPLOYERS IT'S WHAT FRUSTRATES THE CARRIERS IT'S WHAT FRUSTRATES THE INJURED WORKERS. THE SYSTEM IS OVERLY COMPLEX WHEN THE GRAND BARGAIN WAS FIRST- INITIATED. THE WORKERS COMPENSATIONRULES COULD BE CONTAINED IN A PAMPHLET IT IS NOW OF BIBLICAL PROPORTIONS BUT COVERS OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND STATUTES FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION WILL TELL YOU FROM AN ATTORNEY STANDPOINT USED TO HAVE TO DO. REPORTS FOR WHICH I WOULD WAS PAID I WOULD MUCH RATHER. BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT THE REPORT THAN TO GET A LETTER WITH MY REPORT THE TELLS ME TO DO ANOTHER REPORT. FOR WHICH I'M NOT GETTING ADEQUATELY PAY I MEAN I CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC MUMBO JUMBO THAT WE BUILT INTO THIS PROCESS. IT PROBABLY DOES DISSUADE PEOPLE FROM PARTICIPATING IN PROVIDING BADLY NEEDED. MEDICAL SERVICES TO INJURED WORKERS TO GET THEIR CLAIM MOVING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT POINT AND BUT WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM THE W. C. WHOSE MISSION STATEMENT HAD HAS BEEN FOR THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS TO. DO ANYTHING ON THE LINES TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SPECIFICALLY SARAH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBERS. I PASSED MY CLIENTS I SAID. WHAT DO YOU NEED. THE BIGGEST THING HE SAID AS THEY NEED TO BE LEFT ALONE SO THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK AND READ THE REPORTS WITHOUT BEING HOUSEHOLD. AND HE SAID I'M PROBABLY OKAY IF I MEDICAL RATE. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX IF THEY WERE THERE. BUT THAT'S YOUR CLIENTS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM NO SOME OF THEM LEFT I HAVE AN ORTHOPEDIC WHO WHO SIGNED UP BUT DIDNT AND SAID WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M NOT IN. WHY I GET HASSLED. FORTY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY BUSINESS AND IF THOSE RATES I DON'T NEED TO DO I. LOOK AT THEIR FINANCIAL SPENDING THE CARRIERS UNDERSTAND FINANCIAL MARKETS BETTER THAN ALL OF US. YOU PAY ENOUGH MONEY PEOPLE WILL COME SO MAYBE THE POINT IS AND IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING FOR FUN ARE PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD GUY. MAYBE GIVE THE FIFTY PERCENT. AND THEN. A YEAR LATER YOU ORDER THAT THERE'S A STATE IS HE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE HAS THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL OUR PROSAUROPOD STUDY FROM THE FOURTEEN YEARS WELL OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE. WHOEVER'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FIGURES OUT HOW MANY OF THESE YOU GO TO THE GROUP. AND YOU SAY WHAT WILL IT TAKE IN ORDER TO GET X. NUMBER OF YOU. TO COME PROVIDE A SERVICE AND THEN YOU BUILD WHATEVER THE FIX IS AROUND THAT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO THROW DARTS THE BOARD HOPE YOU AT THE CENTER RIGHT YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION AND THE DEBUT SECRET ANSWER THEY NEEDED TO STUDY ANALYZED RESEARCH. YES THAT'S BEEN A BASIC QUESTION FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. I CAN SHED A LITTLE BIT MORE LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE- PLEASE MR PARRIS SOTO MENTIONED THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A MARKETING ARM THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MARKET IN TERMS OF WHAT IT TAKES TO BRING DOCTORS INTO THE SYSTEM. THAT'S WHERE COMPANIES LIKE OURS COME IN BECAUSE OUR MISSION IS TO PRESENT THE QUEUE AT ME DOC UP OPPORTUNITY TO PHYSICIANS. AND HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL ADDS PRACTICING Q. AND MEETS. THE TYPICAL PHONE CALL WITH THE PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT A Q. ME GOES LIKE THIS. WHAT THE FIRST QUESTION THEY ASK IS WHAT DOES THE WORK AND TAIL WE DESCRIBE THE WORK. FIRST QUALIFYING CRITERIA IS ARE THEY OPEN TO DO DOING MEDICAL LEGAL EVALUATIONS IF THE ANSWER IS YES THE SECOND QUESTION IS ALWAYS. WHAT DOES THIS OPPORTUNITY PAY. AND THE ANSWER IS SOMETIMES YOU'LL EARN SIX TWENTY FIVE FLAT. SOMETIME TO LEARN NINE HUNDRED FLAT. AND ONCE IN AWHILE IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT YOU COULD EARN UP TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND IF THEY DON'T HANG UP BUT THAT POEM. START ASKING QUESTIONS. THEY SAY WHEN I DO A GLOBAL EXPERT MISS WORK FOR US- LINES OF WORK I GET PAID WAY MORE THAN THAT WHY BUT I STAND UP. FOR A MORE COMPLEX MORE. TAXES WE'RE I'M GOING TO BE PAID NOTHING CLOSE TO MY BILLING RATE. AND THIS IS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. STRUCK PREVENTION FIFTY THREE SEVEN SIX. ACTUALLY PROVIDES MEDICAL OFFICE DO NOT. UP TO THE FIGHT. ALL TO THE REGULAR THE RIVER IS TO PROVIDE FOR COMPENSATION- DARK OUR INTEREST IN DOING MEDICAL. DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THE SITUATION WHERE INTO THAT THAT IS THE FEE SCHEDULE DIFFERENTIATE BY SPECIALTY NOTE THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE AN OVER REPRESENTATION OF. ACUPUNCTURISTS PSYCHOLOGISTS AND CHIROPRACTORS RELATIVE TO ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS A NEUROSURGEON SO AT A MINIMUM THE EFFORT. HERE WHOEVER'S DOING IT NEEDS TO TAKE A LOOK AND- AT AT ONCOLOGY INFECTIOUS DISEASE PSYCHIATRY SOME OF THE OTHER SPECIALTIES THAT OUR- QUIZ I GENERAL PRACTICE BUT BUT- OUR- OUR- OUR DIFFICULT. SITES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO FILL BECAUSE- THEIR SHORTAGES CERTAINLY IN CERTAIN. GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS IN THE STATE. AND PROVIDE A- A DIFFERENTIAL TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS NOW WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE A POPULAR THING BUT- OUR JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THAT INJURED WORKERS ARE TAKEN CARE OF NOT THAT. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY TO THE SAME DEGREE. I AGREE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT FIFTH OF WOULD NOT OPPOSE THAT AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I REPRESENT PRIMARILY WORKING SURGEONS AND- TECHNOLOGY. WILL HAVE TO BE REALISTIC WE NEED TO RECRUIT SOME ONCOLOGISTS IN THE SYSTEM. WE NEED TO GET FIVE OF THE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A PANEL. AND THERE'S OTHER SUBSPECIALTIES AS WELL WE NEED TO PAY A PREMIUM THAT WE DEAL WITH. SOME OF THE FRANKLY WILL BE AFTER YOU. SET THIS PREMIUM THAT. SOMEBODY GETS OUT THERE AND EXPLAINS TO THE ONCOLOGY. BETTER THERE THAT THEY CAN DO THIS. THE SERVICE TO PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GONNA BE REIMBURSED ADEQUATELY AND CURSED ME SPEAKING OF PANELS OF. THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. HAVE FOLKS SELF CERTIFY THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO IF THEY'RE GOING TO CUT MY NAME'S GOING TO POP OUT ON THE PANEL THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO DO THE WORK WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OR NINETY DAYS SO WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO THIS. SECOND PANEL IN THIRD PANEL IN FOURTH PANEL IN FIFTH PANEL. CHURNING OUT NAMES OF PHYSICIANS THAT AREN'T SIMPLY AREN'T AVAILABLE FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. AND TO YOUR POINT ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES WE SEE NOW IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR WITH IS THE SHORTAGE OF CUNY'S IS NOW THE WC ATTACKS SECURE MEETS ON WHAT. YOUR REPORT IS ONE OR TWO DAYS LATE. STATUS HAS GOT TO BE THERE IN THIRTY DAYS. IT'S ONE DAY LATE. WELL AUDIT YOU AND IF YOU'RE LATE MORE THAN THREE FOUR TIMES IN YOUR REPORTS. WE GOT A PROBLEM WITH YOU WELL THERE LATE BECAUSE WORK IN MY CLIENTS TELL ME THEY'RE WORKING SIX TO SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. RIGHT JUST LIKE THE- NO BUT LONG HOURS IS. WHAT'S REQUIRED TO DO ALL THIS WORK AND THEN OF COURSE. TO THE AUDITOR'S REPORT I WOULD IMAGINE THE QUALITY. IS GOING TO SUFFER BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST WORKING TOWARD OF ALL OF US WORK. ALL DAY AND NIGHT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE POOR WORK PRODUCTS. SO IT GOES BACK BRING IN THE QUEUE ME SENT TO THE SYSTEM. THE SPECIALTY I MEAN WHY DOES THE CARDIOLOGISTS GET THE SAME RATE AS A CHIROPRACTOR. PRETTY TWENTY NOW BURDEN FOR THE OUTLOOK SO. CARDIOLOGISTS AMY THINK IT'S SEVEN FIFTY OR SOMETHINGLIKE THAT IN OUR WHERE THEY WORK FOR TWO FIFTY IT'S REAL SIMPLE ECONOMICS IT'S NOT COMPLEX. SIGNATURE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE THE MOVE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. YES MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A- COMMENT THE QUESTION AND THEN A WRAP UP COMMENT. MY FIRST COMMENT IS TO THE AUDITOR EXCELLENT JOB I THINK YOU WERE VERY IMPARTIAL AND YOU TOLD IT LIKE IT WAS. TO THE CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR FOR JUMPING ON HOT COALS AND TRYING TO DO THE DANCE YOU'VE DONE YOUR JOB. SO NOW I CAN REALLY TALK ABOUT AMERICA. THERE SPEAKERS IN THE RESTROOM YEAH SENSE THAT COMMENT NOW. TO THE PANEL HERE. IN THE MEDICAL FIELD WHICH I. INSURANCE MEDICAL I. PROCESS THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE- THERE IS A FACTOR CALLED NORMAL AND REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY CODED MEDICAL. SERVICE CHARGES. IN OTHER WORDS YOU GET A PATINT FROM X. Y. Z. INSURANCE COMPANY YOU CODED INTO THE INSURANCE COMPANY DEPENDING UPON YOUR CONTRACT WITH THAT INSURANCE COMPANY THEY PAY X. AMOUNT OF MONEY. NOW. I HAVE TO ASSUME WITH THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. IT'S SOMEWHAT THE SAME BUT YOU'RE WORKING IN THEIR WORLD SO. MEDICARE PAYS BETWEEN FORTY TWO AND 44% OF THE BILL. MEDI CAL SOMEWHERE IN THE THIRTIES NOW. SO CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION WHAT PERCENT DOES WORKERS COMP PAY ON THE AVERAGE CLAIM. COMPARED TO REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY CAN ANYONE ANSWER THAT. TALK ABOUT TREATING PHYSICIAN WILL GO TO PULL. IT OFF SPEAK IN 50% OF- OF MEDICARE RIGHT BUT IN FACT THE IN ORDER TO BE ON THE M. P. ENDS OF PHYSICIANS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE A 15% DISCOUNT FROM THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE TO HAVE AN OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE IT CITED A- AN EXTRA PERCENT ABOVE MEDICARE- TO COMPENSATE FOR ALL THE EXTRA WORK THAT'S REQUIRED TO TREAT A WORKERS COMPENSATION PATIENTS. A LOT OF EXTRA FORMS TO FILL OUT YOUR TO PUT EXTRA THINGS NEED REPORT YOU NEED TO BE VERY DETAILED AND FRANKLY GETTING TREATMENT AUTHORIZES QUITE DIFFICULT AND THAT'S WHY A LOT OF ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS JUST DROP OUT IF YOU CAN FOR YOUR PRACTICE WITH. A BLUE CROSS THEY HAVE BEEN PATIENTS AT THE PLACE SINCE AND WHY WOULD YOU HOUSE SO WITH WORKERS COMP YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAID LESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE DISCOUNT TO TREAT WITH THEM- THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET HOUSEHOLD AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TREAT THE PATIENT. IT'S LIKE WOW I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS SO YOU KNOW WHAT WITH THE GUY THAT I GO TO FOR MY TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT I CAN'T SEND A PATIENT TO BE SYSTEMS REALLY STAR JACK I JUST. I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE WORKERS COMPENSATION PATIENTS IS JUST NOT WORTH IT FOR ME. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION I pPRETTY GOOD HEART PUMP THE OTHER THING THAT I POINT OUT TO THE CHAIR ONCE AGAIN AS YOUR INSURANCE BROKER YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE A JOKE. FROM RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ALSO WITH ALL OF THE PROVIDERS OF ANY KIND. IS US BABY BOOMER DOCTORS AND PRACTITIONERS ARE SAYING SCREW IT WERE RETIREE WE'RE DONE I'VE LOST MANY DOCTORS NOW SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THEN I GET BACK. IN THIS IS MY FINAL COMMENT THIS IS LATE I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN VERY NICE. MYFINAL COMMENT BRINGS YOU BACK TO THE BILL READ. HEY THE BREED NEVER LIFE'S ON ONE END OF THE BREED- IS PRICE AND IT'S PAID BY THE EMPLOYER ON THE OTHER END OF THE BREED ALWAYS BENEFITS YOU PROVIDE IN THE PRICE PROVIDES IT. YOU COULD SQUEEZE ONE IN. AND THE BENEFITS POP OUT YOU GET LESS BENEFITS BUT THE PRICE GOES DOWN. YOU SQUEEZE THE BENEFIT AND- PRICE GOES UP MONEY POPS OUT THAT WAY. NOW WHAT I'M LOOKING AT HERE WITH ALL THE TESTIMONY. IS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ONCE AGAIN I GET BACK TO THAT. IS DOING A TEMP MEANT 3% LOWER IN OF THE ADVISORY. PREMIUM RATES NOW ADVISORY MEANS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ADVISING YOU TO DROP YOUR RATES. WHO DO YOU THINK THEY MIGHT. THIS IS SIMPLY A THIRTEEN POINT OR TEN POINT 3% REDUCTION OF PREMIUM RATES ON A PRICE AND OF THE BURRITO SO Q. A ME SERVICE LEVELS REPRESENT THE DELAY. AND DENIAL. OF WORKERS COMP CLAIMS SIMPLY BY DEFAULT SEE I DON'T HAVE TO DENY YOUR CLAIM. ALL I GOTTA DO IS LET IT GO FOR EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. MAYBE I'LL DIE WHO THAT MEANS WE MAKE MONEY SERIOUSLY IT'S BRUTAL THIS IS A BRUTAL SYSTEM THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM YOU CAN DIE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR MONTHS- IF YOU'RE NOT BEING TAKEN CARE OF YOU'RE NOT DIAGNOSED CORRECTLY- SON OF A GUN. YOUR THAT ROOFER. HI. WHAT DO YOU MATTER IN THE SYSTEM YOU'RE NOTHING YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER BLOOD CORPUSCLE IN THE ECONOMIC- BLOOD STREAM. SO. WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW MISTER CHAIR AND PEOPLE WE ARE SQUEEZING BOTH ENDS OF THE BURRITO SAME TIME. WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BE HERE RIGHT NOW TODAY. TO LOOK AT THIS THIS IS GOD'S WORK THANK YOU YOU HAVE. THANK YOU. RIGHT WITH THAT LET ME. WELL THINK THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL GLOOMY JUST THANK YOU GUYS BECAUSE I'M A SAY MY QUESTIONS WHAT I WANT TO DO IS WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME IS MAYBE ASK- MR PER SET UP TO COME BACK UP MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THIS I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR. YOUR TESTIMONY FOR SHE'D. THANK YOU FOR STAYING IN LISTENING TO THE ADDITIONAL- TESTIMONY BUT I JUST DID WHAT WE DID WANT TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND- TO THE LAST PANEL ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED WHETHER. AND I'LL LET YOU BEGIN WHEREVER YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN AND THEN MAYBE WE CANNOT. GO WITH QUESTIONS FROM THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I MEAN THERE'S- TERE'S- JUST A LOT OF WATER I. EAT STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH. A MIDDLE WHAT I THINK THAT WAS SAID THAT REALLY ISN'T RELEVANT TO WHAT'S GOING ON. WITH THE AUDIT. MMHM WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FEES. YES WE ARE REVISING THE MET LEGAL FEES CONTROL. NO ONE OF THE PRODUCT PROBLEMS I THINK WE HAD WITH THE OLD ONE OF IN PLACE WAS THAT. IT WAS- INTERPRETED IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS YOU KNOW WE NEED SOME WE NEED SOMETHING SIMPLER. WE NEED TO HAVE FEES THAT REFLECTS THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. YOU KNOW 50% EIGHTY PERCENT. THIRTY PERCENT- WHATEVER THAT IS WHATEVER THAT IS KIND AND THAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE PAID. SO LET ME JUST ASK ON THAT FRONT BECAUSE YOU KNOW. STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS THAT YOU'RE CONDUCTING NOW ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT MAYBE. SOME DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN. I THINK THEY SAID THE CARDIOLOGISTS TO THE CHIROPRACTOR. FOR INSTANCE TO MAYBE HELP. GET MORE Q. AMIS INTO THE SYSTEM WELL I WOULD THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WILL BE PROPOSED ESSENTIALLY IS A FLAT RATE. NO BECAUSE REALLY JUST DEPENDS UPON WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT DISPUTE IS BEING PRESENTED WHAT KIND OF SPECIALTY TO THE ACTUALLY RIVER IS NEEDED TO RESOLVE THAT KIND OF DISPUTE- I THINK A FLAT RATE IS WOULD HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE- NOTE. THERE KNOW WHAT. PLAYERS KNOW WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY AND THEY KNOW WHAT PRODUCT THEY'RE GOING TO GET IN RETURN- WE NEED TO GET QUALITY REPORTS WE'VE HEARD PEOPLE SAY YOU KNOW THE WHAT EIGHTY PERCENT- OF HOW MANY PERCENT OF. REPORTS ARE NOT GOOD QUALITY. I'M VERY LEERY OF THROWING MONEY. AT THIS AT A SITUATION OR TO SCENARIO OR SYSTEM THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AS BROKEN WERE ALL THE REPORTS ARE BAD. AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IN THE WHOLE PROCESS. WE NEED CONSISTENCY WE NEED SOMETHING THAT'S PREDICTABLE NOW WHETHER THAT NEED TO BE BROKEN DOWN AMONG SPECIALTIES I THINK I THINK THAT'S A GREAT DISCUSSION FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND I HOPE AND I HOPE THEY HAVE THAT- I THINK THERE PROBABLY SHOULD BE SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN YOU KNOW A QUOTE ON QUOTE RUN OF THE MILL CASES IF THERE EVER WAS ONE OR SOMETHING THAT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED WHETHER THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE BODY PARTS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION YEAH LIVE% OPERABLE WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S- HAS SO MANY MOVING PARTS. MANY ON TO FOCUS ON ON ON ONE IN ON A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE I THINK- IS A LITTLE IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS. CAN YOU KNOW THE ALL THE ALL THE PEOPLE UP HERE. ON THE PANEL. YOUR PART OF THOSE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS. AND I THINK THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. PUT THEIR OPINION SEN. TALK WITH EMPLOYERS AND SEE IF THEYCAN REACH AN AGREEMENT. CAUGHT HIM TOP JUST TRYING TO. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS LIKE WELL IF WE NEED. MORE ORTHOPEDIC DOCTORS. HOW DO WE GET MORE OF THOSE INTO THE SYSTEM WELL AS I SAY WE NEED TO HAVE THE SCHEDULE THAT PROVIDES ADEQUATE REPRESENTATION AND THEN IT'S REALLY AND THEN ALSO I THINK WE NEED SIMPLICITY IN THIS WE NEED MORE SIMPLICITY IN OUR SYSTEM WE HAVE A LOT OF RULES WE HAVE A LOT OF OBLIGATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN STATUTES AND REFORMS THAT SWING BACK AND FORTH EVERY FOUR YEARS THAT HAD MORE BUT BUT ADDED ON TOP. NO INSTEAD INSTEAD OF SAYING LOOK LET'S JUST PEELED THIS BACK AND SEE WHAT'S REALLY NECESSARY ADEQUATE COMPENSATION I AGREE SIMPLICITY IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN YOU KNOW WE RELY ON PRIVATE ON PRIDE ON PRIVATE DOCTORS TO JOIN OUR SYSTEM IN WE COULD SELL IT TO THEM I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD I WOULD HOPE THEY WOULD JOIN GOT IT RIGHT AND THEN CAN YOU JUST MENTIONED WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT AND ALL THE OTHER PANELS BUT- THE UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS OF THE COURT CASE SO WHAT HAPPENED AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND- WHAT GOT ADDRESSED THERE WAS AN ALLEGATION THAT WE WERE USING UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. A COURT CASE WAS FILED- I THINK A DECISION WAS REACHED- THAT THROUGHOUT THE CASE ON ON JURISDICTIONAL GROUNDS BECAUSE IT WASN'T RAISED BEFORE THE W. C. A. B. THERE WAS DICTA IN THE DECISION SAYING THAT WE POSSIBLY HAD UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS. AT THAT POINT I THINK BOTH SIDES CAME TO THE TABLE AND SAY LET'S SETTLE THIS AND WE DID- YOU KNOW I CAN'T HAVE. THEM AS A MENTION I DON'T HAVE A BIG STE I DON'T HAVE A BIG STAFF HERE TO DO A LOT OF THIS WORK. AND I CAN'T HAVE THEM SPENDING ALL OF THEIR DEBT ALL THEIR TIME. FIGHTING LITIGATION. NO WEEDS WITH SO THE CASE WAS SETTLED SETTLED ON BOTH SIDES. FEDERAL OKAY. AND THEN IT HUNTING THAT STRUCK ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT DUE PROCESS CERTAINLY- BUT THEN IF. YOU KNOW TO HEARINGS IN THREE YEARS IT SEEMS HOW ARE WE ADDRESSING THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE IF THAT'S THE CASE WELL I THINK AS THEY SAY WHAT HAVE WHAT HAPPENED IN 200-014-2000 SIXTEEN. YOU KNOW I THINK CARP OUR PROCESS IS BEEN- YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED AT IT WE ARE. FOLLOWING THE ADMIN A THROUGH THE STRAIT OF PROCEDURES ACT- AND BRINGING CASES APPROPRIATELY AT THAT THE AT THIS POINT. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST I THINK JUST IN THE HOUSE- I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. IT WAS INDIVIDUAL CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP HERE WHATEVER I DON'T I. CAN'T SAY I KNOW ABOUT THEM OFF HAND I'D HAVE TO ASK ABOUT IT. IF SOMEONE DIDN'T FIT A- THE PHYSICIAN WAS TO BEING DISCIPLINED BY US. BECAUSE OR OR OR SOME LETTER WAS SENT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SPEND AN HOUR. THE PATIENT HAD TO GO HOME EARLY WELL THAT'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO SEE. AND MAYBE AND I WILL CERTAINLY TALK TO MY STUFF ABOUT THAT TOMORROW. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE WE JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT. NO DUE PROCESS AND HOW DO WE MAKE THAT MORE EFFICIENT FOR EVERYBODY AND- YOU KNOW WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT FEE SCHEDULE OR- GETTING MORE Q. ENEMIES INTO THE SYSTEM I THINK THAT. HELPS PRODUCE MORE EFFICIENCY RIGHT WELL I THINK AS YOU SEE YOU KNOW WORKERS COMPENSATION- REALLY- BRINGS UP THE VITRIOL. IN PEOPLE- AND I SEE IT THE ELF FROM FROM ALL SIDES YOU KNOW I SEE IT FROM OUR SO YOU KNOW I SEE IT FROM TO FROM OUR SIDE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO CALM DOWN A BIT. AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE OUR SYSTEM BETTER AND IF IT'S ACTUALLY YOU KNOW. THROWING IT IN THROWING THE BURRITO OUT THE WINDOW WELL. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE. OKAY AND THEN JUST ONE LAST THING IT JUST ONE CLARIFICATION SO. LABOR CODE WAS A FIFTY THREE OH SEVEN POINT FIVE POINT SIX. WHATEVER WAS ABOUT THE SCHEDULE BEING UPDATED ANNUALLY IS THAT WITH IT'S THE LABOR CODE SECTION IS THERE IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS THERE AND- IT WAS IN PLACE BEFORE WE TURN TO THE OFFICIAL MAP WE FOR WE TOOK THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL FEE SCHEDULE ONE TIED TO MEDICARE. AND SO YEARS AGO YES- THAT WAS REALLY WHAT THE CASES BUT WE CAN'T YOU KNOW WE CAN'T UPDATE THE MEDICAL FEET LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE NOW. AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO WITH THE OFFICIAL MEDICAL LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE IT'S- IT'S KIND JUST REALLY DOESN'T WORK THAT WELL. GOT IT BUT IT BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR YEARS YOU KNOW BASED ON STUDIES THAT SAID ARE MET LEGAL FEE SCHEDULE WAS PAYING A REASONABLE AMOUNT- BUT- AND THEN SO WE KEPT THAT THE CENTURY THE SAME AS IT WAS- AND- AND ITS PEOPLE LOOK AT IT THEY SAID. THEY SAID IT WAS REASON ENOUGH STUDY SAID IT WAS REASONABLE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT THIS POINT I THINK AND WE REALIZED THIS BEFORE THE AUDIT BEGAN THAT WE NEEDED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEEDED TO HAVE SOME THINGS. OF SIMPLE SOMETHING PREDICTABLE AND THAT WE NEEDED TO INCREASE OUR AND WE NEEDED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION. GOT IT AND WE'RE SUFFERING AND ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I HOPE AND I HOPE I HOPE OR STAKEHOLDERS STATE STAY ENGAGED IN OUR MEETINGS AND I HOPE THEY- THE THEY TALK THE ISSUES OUT AND I HOPE THAT THEY CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT. CUT AND MAYBE THAT'S JUST BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY WHEN PEOPLE SEE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THIS WAS ACTUALLY DISCUSSED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. PER LABOR CODE. OR OR I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS FINE THAT OBJECTIVE STANDARD. FIND OUT REASONABLE OBJECTIVE STANDARD ANTI THE FEE SCHEDULE TO THAT SO THAT WE COULD HAVE REASONABLE INCREASES EVERY YEAR. THAT'S FINE. I HAD ME UP WE HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THAT. YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT. PEOPLE WERE THINKING MAYBE SCHEDULE HELPS. FOR PREDICTABILITY AND- UNDERSTANDING WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE- NEAR FUTURE ANYWAYS. OKAY GREAT SO ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT WAS SAID IN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. RIGHT ANY IN THANK YOU. EIGHT THAT WE HAVE SPOTTED A FEW HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS NOW. OKAY. SO WITH THAT LET ME ASK FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS YOU CAN- JUST ANNOUNCE YOUR NAME YOUR WITH A PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION OR WHAT COUNTY RESIDE IN WE'D APPRECIATE THAT. GIVE THE. ALL RIGHT PLEASE. REPORTED ON BEHALF OF THE HEALTH EDUCATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE MANY ACTIVE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS PROCESS WOULD YOU GIVE ME STEVE APPERT PERTAINING TO THE LACK OF KILLING ME WE ALL AGREED THAT WE WOULD LIKE MORE QUALITY TO THEM YOU CAN ASSIST IN A CERTAIN THE INCREASING COMPENSATION IS A PART OF. AND THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS HOWEVER EQUAL CONSIDERATION MUST BE GIVEN TO OTHER FACTORS THAT DELAY INJURED WORKERS HERE AND BENEFITS SUCH AS THE QUALITY AND TIMELINESS PARTICULARLY REPORT. NOT JUST NINETY SO BY DOING HERE THAT POINT. SEVERAL PRESENTERS HERE TODAY. WE FEEL THAT THE ON GOING REGULATORY EFFORTS ARE GOING TO LEAD TO BETTER COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS TO IMPROVE ACCURATE AND TIMELY BENEFIT. FOR INJURED WORKERS ANYBODY COURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT. THOSE COMPREHENSIVE REGULATORY EFFORTS BEFORE HAPHAZARDLY INTRODUCING FRAGMENTED AND COSTLY LEGISLATION WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND ARE HAPPY TO REMAIN ENGAGED A COLDER THANK YOU THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. A LOOKUP AND PLEASE LOW I'M DEBORAH RUSSELL I'M REPRESENTING SCHOOLS INSURANCE AUTHORITY THE D. W. C. HAS BEEN SENSITIVE TO THE ISSUES OF QUALITY OF THE QUEUE IN A REPORTS PHYSICIAN COMPENSATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF KILOMETERS IN OUR SYSTEM. IN RECENT MONTHS THE DDC HAS BEEN HOSTING STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IN WHICH DOZENS OF INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO BUILD A CONSENSUS AROUND THESE ISSUES. WE BELIEVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WILL RESULT IN CHANGES THAT WILL STREAMLINE THE QUEUE IN ME PROCESS WITHIN THE CURRENT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK. WE AGREE WITH THE COURSE OF ACTION CURRENTLY BEING TAKEN BY THE BBC AND WE URGE YOU TO ALLOW THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO BE COMPLETED. AN APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO THE Q. MAY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED BY THE D. WC PRIOR TO TAKING FURTHER LEGISLATIVE ACTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS TIME WE ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. HEARING AND SEEING NINE HOLE TURN IT BACK TO THE DíAS AND ASK IF ANY MEMBER AS CLOSING COMMENTS. IF NOT I WILL JUST- GOOD AND THANK EVERYBODY FOR TODAY'S INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION OBVIOUSLY WITH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE MODERN RESISTORS AND THERE'S OBVIOUSLY PENDING LEGISLATION AND WHETHER OR NOT- WE'RE REALLY. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT- DEPARTMENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION COMES OUT WITH WITH THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED IN TODAY'S. ALL OVER THREE HOUR HEARING. ON THE ON THE TOPIC SO WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BURRITOS ARE NOT. THERE'S A LOT TO DISCUSS BUT A LOT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND SO WE WILL- WANT TO BE IN ENGAGE STAKEHOLDER AS WELL IN THAT PROCESS AND WHETHER SOMETHING NEEDS A LEGISLATIVE FIX OR WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RESOURCES OR WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS- ARE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED TO RETURN BACK EITHER TO THE WORK FORCE OR JUST. BE BETTER BE HEALTHY- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN AND WANT TO BE ENGAGED IN- LIKE I SAID IN MY OPENING COMMENTS I BELIEVE THERE'S PROBABLY. A PATHWAY I THINK FOR A WIN WIN HERE- OR WE CAN DECREASE COSTS TO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BY. CREATING SOME OF THESE EFFICIENCIES ARE CLEARING UP SOME OF THESE MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND WE WANT TO BE IN ENGAGE PARTNER IN THAT. AND SO- WITH THAT I'M GOING TO CONCLUDE THIS. HEARING AT SEVEN EIGHTEEN PM AND THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF THE J. LACKEY THANK YOU
