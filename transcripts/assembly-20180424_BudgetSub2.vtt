00:40:33.564 --> 00:40:36.934 region:rollup2
THE VALUE SPONSORS PLACE ON

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:38.903 region:rollup2

SO PAGE SIX DESCRIBES THE

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:46.277 region:rollup2

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:07.665 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PROPOSAL FROM THE

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:09.367 region:rollup2

GOING. FOR OUR SI.

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:16.908 region:rollup2
MOST OF THAT A. DOLLAR AMOUNT IS

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:18.576 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ARE A SITE

00:41:16.908 --> 00:41:20.411 region:rollup2
FOR A MORE OUR SITE HOURS TO

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:21.913 region:rollup2
FIND MORE HOURS. AND IT WOULD

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.115 region:rollup2
BRING THE BUDGET YEAR HOURS UP

00:41:21.913 --> 00:41:25.516 region:rollup2
TO WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE

00:41:24.115 --> 00:41:26.851 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR SO YOU WOULD YOU

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:28.486 region:rollup2
WOULD FIND ABOUT JUST UNDER

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.088 region:rollup2
UNDER NINE MILLION HOURS AGAIN

00:41:28.486 --> 00:41:32.357 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXPECTED AND. IN THE

00:41:30.088 --> 00:41:33.624 region:rollup2
CURRENT YEAR INTO FUND THAT

00:41:32.357 --> 00:41:34.792 region:rollup2
AGAIN AND IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:41:33.624 --> 00:41:36.394 region:rollup2
THE REST OF THE MONEY THAT

00:41:34.792 --> 00:41:38.896 region:rollup2
ONGOING MONIES ASSOCIATE WITH

00:41:36.394 --> 00:41:40.665 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE RSI RATE.

00:41:38.896 --> 00:41:42.367 region:rollup2
TO SIX DOLLARS AND FORTY NINE

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:44.035 region:rollup2
CENTS AGAIN FROM FIVE DOLLARS

NINETY CENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:41:44.035 --> 00:41:47.505 region:rollup2
STATUTORY RATE.

00:41:46.371 --> 00:41:49.474 region:rollup2
THERE'S A THIRD PROPOSAL HERE

00:41:47.505 --> 00:41:51.042 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR HAS.

00:41:49.474 --> 00:41:52.710 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW SOME

00:41:51.042 --> 00:41:54.178 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.680 region:rollup2
COURSES TO GENERATE FUNDING AT A

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:57.582 region:rollup2
MUCH HIGHER RATE TEN DOLLARS AND

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:59.550 region:rollup2
THIRTY EIGHT CENTS.

00:41:57.582 --> 00:42:00.985 region:rollup2
PER HOUR WHICH WOULD WHICH IS

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:02.787 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT HIGHER THAN

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:05.323 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED SIX DOLLARS FORTY

00:42:02.787 --> 00:42:07.291 region:rollup2
NINE CENT RSI RATE. SO AGAIN

00:42:05.323 --> 00:42:09.193 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE JUST ANA A CERTAIN

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:11.963 region:rollup2
PORTION OF.

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:13.131 region:rollup2
OF APPRENTICESHIP RSI OWE IT

00:42:11.963 --> 00:42:14.532 region:rollup2
WOULD GET THAT HIGHER RATE IN

00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:16.267 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING WOULD BE PAID OUT OF

00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:17.602 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE GENERAL

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.003 region:rollup2
PURPOSE POT OF MONEY SO THE OF

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:20.037 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.571 region:rollup2
I'D RATHER THAN THE

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:22.306 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP CATEGORICAL

00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:24.275 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

00:42:22.306 --> 00:42:25.143 region:rollup2
TO EARN THE HIGHER FUNDING RATE

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.310 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP COURSES WOULD

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:27.445 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE TAUGHT BY COMMUNITY

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:29.514 region:rollup2
COLLEGE INSTRUCTORS

00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:31.616 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN.

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:32.750 region:rollup2
SPONSORS INSTRUCTOR.

00:42:31.616 --> 00:42:34.952 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR INDICATES THAT

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:35.787 region:rollup2
HIS PROPOSAL COULD INCENTIVIZE

00:42:34.952 --> 00:42:38.156 region:rollup2
MORE COLLEGES TO OFFER CREDIT

00:42:35.787 --> 00:42:39.891 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS.

00:42:38.156 --> 00:42:41.325 region:rollup2
SO PAGE SEVEN SUMMARIZES OUR

00:42:39.891 --> 00:42:44.228 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT OF THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:45.563 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THOSE THREE PROPOSALS.

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:47.165 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:48.733 region:rollup2
FIRST PROPOSAL.

00:42:47.165 --> 00:42:50.334 region:rollup2
STATE LAW MAKES CLEAR THAT IF

00:42:48.733 --> 00:42:52.470 region:rollup2
STATE FUNDING IS NOT SUFFICIENT

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:54.138 region:rollup2
TO COVER ALL OF THE HOURS THAT

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:55.606 region:rollup2
SPONSORS ARE PROVIDING SPONSORS

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:56.674 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO STAY

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.676 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:59.877 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION.

00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:01.279 region:rollup2
DESPITE KNOWING THAT STAMPER

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:03.381 region:rollup2
STATE REIMBURSEMENT WAS LIKELY

00:43:01.279 --> 00:43:04.782 region:rollup2
TO BE PRO RATED DOWNWARD AFTER

00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:05.783 region:rollup2
ALL IT'S BEEN PRETTY DOWNWARD

00:43:04.782 --> 00:43:07.685 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST FIVE

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:09.220 region:rollup2
YEARS. SPONSORS CONTINUE TO

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.388 region:rollup2
COVER THESE COSTS AND THE

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.757 region:rollup2
PROGRAM CONTINUED TO GROW

00:43:10.388 --> 00:43:13.858 region:rollup2
RAPIDLY SO EMPLOYERS FELT THAT

00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:15.393 region:rollup2
IT WAS WORTH IT THAT OUT TO KICK

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:16.894 region:rollup2
IN THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE

00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:18.196 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM HOURS.

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:19.630 region:rollup2
SO AS A RESULT WE DON'T SEE A

00:43:18.196 --> 00:43:20.965 region:rollup2
COMPELLING REASON FOR THE

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:23.401 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:24.836 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVE REIMBURSEMENTS.

00:43:23.401 --> 00:43:27.038 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO THIS GOVERNOR

00:43:24.836 --> 00:43:29.807 region:rollup2
SECOND PROPOSAL.

00:43:27.038 --> 00:43:31.175 region:rollup2
WE WE HAD KNOWLEDGE SO THAT

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:33.978 region:rollup2
WELL THOUGH PROVIDING

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:35.947 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVE RSI HOURS MIGHT NOT

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:37.949 region:rollup2
BE NECESSARY WE DO AGREE WITH

00:43:35.947 --> 00:43:40.485 region:rollup2
WITH THIS THAT THE STATE SHOULD

00:43:37.949 --> 00:43:43.287 region:rollup2
TRY TO AVOID. FUTURE PRO RATA

00:43:40.485 --> 00:43:44.989 region:rollup2
REDUCTIONS DO WHATEVER I CAN TO.

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:47.191 region:rollup2
TO AVOID THOSE FUTURE REDUCTIONS

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:48.659 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED A BIT THAT AS.

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:51.195 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY THE

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:53.131 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR THE AUGMENTATION MAY

00:43:51.195 --> 00:43:54.398 region:rollup2
NOT BE ENOUGH THOUGH. ARE IN THE

00:43:53.131 --> 00:43:56.367 region:rollup2
IN THE BUDGET YEAR TO FULLY

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:58.736 region:rollup2
ALIGN FUNDING WITH THE PROJECTED

00:43:56.367 --> 00:44:00.972 region:rollup2
HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:03.708 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. AS I AS I'VE DESCRIBED

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:05.009 region:rollup2
ON ON PAGE SIX PREVIOUS PAGE THE

00:44:03.708 --> 00:44:06.644 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD FIND THE

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:08.312 region:rollup2
SAME NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:09.614 region:rollup2
BUDGET YEAR AS IN AS WHAT'S

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.883 region:rollup2
EXPECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:13.417 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN RECENT GROWTH TRENDS

00:44:11.883 --> 00:44:15.253 region:rollup2
SPONSORS LIKELY ARE GOING TO

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:18.055 region:rollup2
EXCEED THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:44:15.253 --> 00:44:18.589 region:rollup2
LEVEL. AND IF THEY DO. WE'RE

00:44:18.055 --> 00:44:20.024 region:rollup2
GONNA END UP IN THE SAME

00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:21.225 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO MAKE

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:23.060 region:rollup2
A STATE TO HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER

00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:24.996 region:rollup2
ROUND OF PRO RATA REDUCTIONS IN

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:27.565 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:28.499 region:rollup2
SO THE THIRD DIED.

00:44:27.565 --> 00:44:30.234 region:rollup2
CHECK BOX YOU.

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:31.569 region:rollup2
WE WE REALLY KIND OF OUR SAXMAN

00:44:30.234 --> 00:44:33.171 region:rollup2
IS WE DON'T THINK THAT

00:44:31.569 --> 00:44:34.772 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING THE

00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:35.740 region:rollup2
CREDIT RATE FOR CERTAIN

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:37.141 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CREDIT

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.609 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP COURSES IS

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:40.178 region:rollup2
WARRANTED.

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:41.512 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO EXPAND

00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.813 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:44.815 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS YET VIRTUALLY

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:46.551 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:47.852 region:rollup2
VIRTUALLY ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:44:46.551 --> 00:44:49.487 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIP COURSES ARE ARE

00:44:47.852 --> 00:44:50.988 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY. OFFERED ON A CREDIT

00:44:49.487 --> 00:44:52.857 region:rollup2
BASIS.

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:53.424 region:rollup2
AND GIVEN HOW QUICKLY

00:44:52.857 --> 00:44:54.325 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS HAVE BEEN

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:56.460 region:rollup2
GROWING IN RECENT YEARS THE

00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:56.994 region:rollup2
STATE ALREADY IS ON TRACK TO

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.229 region:rollup2
REACH A HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:44:56.994 --> 00:44:59.397 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

00:44:58.229 --> 00:45:00.865 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS BY TWENTY TWENTY

00:44:59.397 --> 00:45:04.068 region:rollup2
SEVEN WHICH IS

00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:05.570 region:rollup2
THE GOAL OF THE STATE HAS SET.

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:07.038 region:rollup2
OUR FOURTH THE KIND OF

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.273 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:45:07.038 --> 00:45:11.642 region:rollup2
WOULD RESULT IN EVEN GREATER

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:13.477 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENCY IN RULES UP FOR

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:14.245 region:rollup2
SIMILAR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:16.547 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALREADY

00:45:14.245 --> 00:45:18.883 region:rollup2
A COMPLEX

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:20.284 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF PAYMENT AND IT WOULD

00:45:18.883 --> 00:45:22.053 region:rollup2
REALLY FURTHER COMPLICATE

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:23.354 region:rollup2
APPRENTICESHIPS BY PROVIDING A

00:45:22.053 --> 00:45:24.922 region:rollup2
HIGHER FUNDING RATE

00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:26.724 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FUNNY RATE

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:28.759 region:rollup2
FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:30.194 region:rollup2
RSI POWERS THOSE CREDIT HOURS

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:31.862 region:rollup2
BUT NOT FOR OTHER COMMUNITY

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:34.031 region:rollup2
COLLEGE APPRENTICESHIP R. S.

00:45:31.862 --> 00:45:34.632 region:rollup2
HOURS ARE NOT FOR SCHOOLS EITHER

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:37.068 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOLS WOULDN'T GET THAT

00:45:34.632 --> 00:45:38.970 region:rollup2
HIGHER RATE. AYE EVEN THOUGH ALL

00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:40.571 region:rollup2
OF THIS CONTENT IS COMPARABLE.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.706 region:rollup2
SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ON

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:43.975 region:rollup2
PAGE EIGHT. THREE

00:45:41.706 --> 00:45:46.043 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST TO REJECT

00:45:43.975 --> 00:45:48.245 region:rollup2
THE RETROACTIVE REIMBURSEMENTS

00:45:46.043 --> 00:45:48.779 region:rollup2
SECOND TO APPROVE ACTUALLY MORE

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:50.615 region:rollup2
THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:52.016 region:rollup2
PROPOSING ON ON GOING BASIS TO

00:45:50.615 --> 00:45:53.284 region:rollup2
PROVE TWENTY THREE POINT SIX

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:54.986 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS RATHER THAN

00:45:53.284 --> 00:46:02.226 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN POINT EIGHT. MILLION

00:45:54.986 --> 00:46:03.094 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD FIND TEN PERCENT

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:03.928 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN OUR ESSAY OFF RSI

00:46:03.094 --> 00:46:05.796 region:rollup2
HOURS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:07.298 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WHICH IS. THE AVERAGE

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:08.833 region:rollup2
GROWTH OF THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THE PETE

00:49:40.411 --> 00:49:43.180 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ALIGNED WITH THAT

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:09.907 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. THAT WOULD STILL CLAIM

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:10.908 region:rollup2
THE RSI APPORTIONMENT. AND IT

00:50:09.907 --> 00:50:12.176 region:rollup2

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:29.693 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY COULD

00:50:28.292 --> 00:50:31.629 region:rollup2
CLAIM THE APPORTIONMENT RATE.

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:33.163 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP COLLEGES INCREASE

00:50:31.629 --> 00:50:35.266 region:rollup2
THEIR FTA ELSE AT A TIME WHEN

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:37.067 region:rollup2

EXISTING PROGRAMS

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:41.698 region:rollup2
THAT WE THINK COULD BE LEVERAGE

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:43.400 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP IN A PATCH OF

WELDING.

00:56:48.472 --> 00:56:52.276 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT WOULD

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:53.977 region:rollup2
FORCE THAT INSTRUCTION IN THAT

00:56:52.276 --> 00:56:55.379 region:rollup2

00:56:53.977 --> 00:56:57.681 region:rollup2

00:59:30.333 --> 00:59:34.304 region:rollup2
PREMATURE TO FIND PROJECTED

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:35.572 region:rollup2

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.277 region:rollup2
EXPECT THAT NEXT YEAR WE WILL

PROJECTIONS WHEN THE DATA IS A

00:59:44.114 --> 00:59:47.350 region:rollup2

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:54.891 region:rollup2
LITTLE TOO EARLY.

00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:56.693 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY WE

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:58.261 region:rollup2
THINK WE SHOULD WAIT ANOTHER

00:59:56.693 --> 00:59:59.996 region:rollup2
YEAR UNTIL WE HAVE MUCH BETTER.

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:01.731 region:rollup2

A GROWING AREA.

01:00:06.303 --> 01:00:10.040 region:rollup2
AND IF WE SHOULD S. SUBMIT.

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:11.274 region:rollup2

AGAIN FROM TALKING WITH THESE

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:55.098 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IS THAT THE TRAINING

01:08:53.096 --> 01:08:56.866 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

01:08:55.098 --> 01:08:58.868 region:rollup2
EXPAND ENROLLMENTS THEY WILL NOT

01:08:56.866 --> 01:09:00.903 region:rollup2
BE ABLE FOR THE MOST PART TO USE

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.839 region:rollup2
THESE. GRANT MONIES ARE THAT THE

QUALIFICATIONS TO BECOME A CNA

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:18.254 region:rollup2

THE FIELD.

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:29.465 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON FOR THIS

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:30.700 region:rollup2
DISQUALIFICATION ISSUE IS STATE

01:09:29.465 --> 01:09:32.635 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS CURRENT STATE

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.470 region:rollup2

NURSING FACILITY.

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:44.313 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S PROBLEMATIC

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:46.082 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:47.583 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:49.652 region:rollup2

DECADES OF EXPERIENCE PROVIDING

01:09:49.652 --> 01:09:52.088 region:rollup2
DIRECT CARE BUT THE DIRECT CARE

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:53.756 region:rollup2
IS PROVIDED AN ACUTE CARE

01:09:52.088 --> 01:09:55.191 region:rollup2

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
NURSING FACILITY AS A RESULT.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:57.860 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE EVEN

APPLIED TO BE AN INSTRUCTOR IN

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:01.464 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:03.533 region:rollup2
UNLIKE WHAT OTHER STATES DO.

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:04.767 region:rollup2
ARE YOU SIMILARLY YOU HAVE

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:06.269 region:rollup2
NURSES WHO WORK IN A SKILLED

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:08.337 region:rollup2
NURSING FACILITY.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:09.972 region:rollup2
THEY OVERSEE THE C. N. AIDS FOR

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:11.074 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.742 region:rollup2
WE'LL THEY WOULDN'T THEY

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:14.177 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T GET TO BE ELIGIBLE

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.511 region:rollup2
COULD BE CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE TO

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.345 region:rollup2
BE AN INSTRUCTOR EITHER BECAUSE

01:10:15.511 --> 01:10:18.314 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T PROVIDE DIRECT CARE.

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:20.850 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:22.852 region:rollup2
IN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY.

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.786 region:rollup2
SO AND WE LOOKED AT THE. THERE

01:10:22.852 --> 01:10:25.321 region:rollup2
ARE ACTUALLY ARE SOME FEDERAL

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:28.024 region:rollup2

THERE'S NOTHING THERE ABOUT

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.806 region:rollup2
DIRECT CARE.

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:45.808 region:rollup2
IN THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:10:43.806 --> 01:10:46.676 region:rollup2
SO.

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:49.178 region:rollup2
WE TALKED TO.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:50.680 region:rollup2
ADULT SCHOOLS AS I MENTIONED

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:52.648 region:rollup2
AND THEY SAID.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.516 region:rollup2
WELL IN ADDITION TO THE PROBLEM

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:56.018 region:rollup2
OF FINDING.

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:57.753 region:rollup2
SEE AN ACE THAT HAVE THAT CNA

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.155 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS RATHER THAT HAVE

01:10:57.753 --> 01:11:00.289 region:rollup2
THAT DIRECT CARE EXPERIENCE IN A

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.825 region:rollup2
SNAP. NEW SKILLED NURSING

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:04.560 region:rollup2
FACILITY THEY HAVE ANOTHER.

01:11:02.825 --> 01:11:07.263 region:rollup2
HURDLE THEY NEED TO FIND AN

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.030 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTOR THAT HAS A. TEACHING

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.998 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.133 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:11.234 region:rollup2
REQUIRED BY THE STATE OF

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:12.568 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT THESE

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:13.903 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS HAVE TO HAVE A

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:15.705 region:rollup2
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:18.107 region:rollup2
TEACHING CREDENTIAL. SO WHAT%

THESE ARE ADULT EDUCATION ADULT

THAT IT'S IT'S HARD TO FIND A IS

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:25.848 region:rollup2
SUCH INDIVIDUALS.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:28.284 region:rollup2
AND DIE AS A RESULT THEY FEEL

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:29.385 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WOULD BE HARD PRESSED.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.319 region:rollup2
THE CITADEL'S SCHOOLS AS WELL AS

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.654 region:rollup2
A COMMUNICATIVE TO EXPAND

ENROLLMENTS.

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:37.026 region:rollup2
SO A.

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:38.861 region:rollup2
IN TANDEM WITH PROVIDING GRANTS

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:40.062 region:rollup2
TO ADULT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY

01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:41.297 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THROUGH WOULD BE A BILL

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.932 region:rollup2
THAT CONSORTIUM WHICH IS OUR

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.300 region:rollup2
FIRST RECOMMENDATION. WE

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:46.536 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CHANGE

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.304 region:rollup2
STATUTE TO ALLOW MORE TYPES

01:11:46.536 --> 01:11:49.839 region:rollup2
OF NURSES TO QUALIFY AS SEEN A

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:51.240 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS.

01:11:49.839 --> 01:11:52.708 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WE RECOMMEND THE

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.610 region:rollup2
NEW POLICY ALLOW NURSES TO

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:56.646 region:rollup2
SERVICE INSTRUCTORS IF THEY'VE

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:58.648 region:rollup2
HAD EXPERIENCE PROVIDING CARE IN

01:11:56.646 --> 01:12:00.683 region:rollup2
AN ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL OR OTHER

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:02.351 region:rollup2
FACILITY. THAT PROVIDES A

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.886 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CARE FOR

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:05.721 region:rollup2
OLDER ADULTS OR THE CHRONICALLY

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:07.723 region:rollup2
ILL. AND WE ALSO RECOMMEND

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:09.091 region:rollup2
PERMITTING AS INSTRUCTORS NURSES

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:10.626 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T PROVIDE DIRECT CARE

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:12.228 region:rollup2
AND A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

01:12:10.626 --> 01:12:13.896 region:rollup2
BUT SUPERVISE SEE AN ACE IN MAY

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:16.666 region:rollup2
OF IN THE PAST HAD DIRECT CARE

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:17.767 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE. IN A ACUTE CARE

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.068 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL OR ELSEWHERE.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:20.169 region:rollup2
SO THESE CHANGES WOULD MAKE

01:12:19.068 --> 01:12:22.605 region:rollup2
RECRUITING AND HIRING

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:24.574 region:rollup2
INSTRUCTORS LAST DIFFICULT FOR

01:12:22.605 --> 01:12:26.075 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WELL CONTINUE TO

01:12:24.574 --> 01:12:28.778 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT INSTRUCTORS MEET

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:30.246 region:rollup2
FEDERER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:12:28.778 --> 01:12:31.847 region:rollup2
SO TO HELP ADULTS SCHOOLS IN

01:12:30.246 --> 01:12:33.149 region:rollup2
HIRING INSTRUCTORS AND ALIGN THE

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:35.418 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS WITH COMMUNITY

01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:37.854 region:rollup2
COLLEGES WE RECOMMEND THE

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:39.088 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AMEND STATUTES. ARE

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.690 region:rollup2
SO THAT INDIVIDUALS NO LONGER

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:42.892 region:rollup2
NEED A TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.393 region:rollup2
SERVE AS A. CNA INSTRUCTOR IN

01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:46.395 region:rollup2
THE ADULT SCHOOLS.

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:47.230 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT SUCH CHANGES TO

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.831 region:rollup2
MINIMUM INSTRUCTOR

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.499 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:52.735 region:rollup2
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AUGMENTING

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:54.770 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR MORE TRAIN SLOTS

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:56.072 region:rollup2
LIKELY WOULD HAVE LITTLE EFFECT

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:58.808 region:rollup2
AND MUCH OF THE GRANT FUNDING

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:59.575 region:rollup2
WOULD GO UNUSED.

01:12:58.808 --> 01:13:02.011 region:rollup2
THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:03.346 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:04.647 region:rollup2
THANK YOU CHRIS US WONDER THE

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:06.249 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:07.850 region:rollup2
AGAIN WE THINK THIS IS A

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:09.452 region:rollup2
REASONABLE PROPOSAL TO USE ONE

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.854 region:rollup2
TIME RESOURCES.

01:13:09.452 --> 01:13:14.557 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED NEED.

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:14.891 region:rollup2
TO THE TWO ISSUES THAT THE THAT

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:17.193 region:rollup2
THE ANALYST.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:18.628 region:rollup2
RAISED UP YOU KNOW I THINK ON

01:13:17.193 --> 01:13:20.029 region:rollup2
THE GRANT PROGRAM OF THAT WITH

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:21.330 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING WE THINK MAKES SENSE

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.665 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THIRTY FIVE COLLEGES

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.800 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY OFFERING OF THESE

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:26.035 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. WE DO THINK THAT IT

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.469 region:rollup2
MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO USE A

01:13:26.035 --> 01:13:28.137 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:29.372 region:rollup2
WAY OF DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:30.640 region:rollup2
TO OUR COLLEGES THE

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:32.008 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

01:19:09.578 --> 01:19:12.081 region:rollup2
MEMBERS WILL PROVIDE THE

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:13.415 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:15.184 region:rollup2
UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:16.852 region:rollup2
INITIAL PLANNING CYCLE RUNS FROM

01:19:15.184 --> 01:19:17.953 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:19.722 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:21.490 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN. AND COULDN'T SOURCE

01:19:19.722 --> 01:19:23.258 region:rollup2
ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING NOW

01:19:21.490 --> 01:19:24.593 region:rollup2
ON DEVELOPING THEIR NEXT PLAN

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:26.729 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IN TWO

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:28.731 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:29.932 region:rollup2
THE AB BG OFFICE HAS REQUESTED

01:19:28.731 --> 01:19:31.533 region:rollup2
THAT THE CURRENT THREE YEAR

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:33.302 region:rollup2
PLANNING CYCLE BE EXTENDED FOR

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:34.970 region:rollup2
ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR THROUGH TWO

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:36.605 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TO

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:38.607 region:rollup2
GIVE CONSORTIUM PARTNERS AN

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:40.376 region:rollup2
EXTRA YEAR TO DEVELOP THEIR PLAN

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:41.744 region:rollup2
AS THEY MOVE FORWARD BEGINNING

01:19:40.376 --> 01:19:42.311 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY.

01:19:41.744 --> 01:19:43.746 region:rollup2
WE AGREE THE EXTRA PLANNING

01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:45.080 region:rollup2
YEAR%

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:46.615 region:rollup2
IS NEEDED SO THE CONSORTIA HAVE

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.883 region:rollup2
ADEQUATE TIME.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.751 region:rollup2
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DATA

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.919 region:rollup2
SHARING.

01:19:48.751 --> 01:19:52.321 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:54.056 region:rollup2
FOR THAT THAT THE FIVE MILLION

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:55.357 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE. AND IT WOULDN'T

01:19:54.056 --> 01:19:56.925 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD HAVE BETTER DATA TO

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:58.327 region:rollup2
ALIGN THEIR PROGRAMS TO WE JUST

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.294 region:rollup2
THINK THERE ARE THERE PLANS

01:19:58.327 --> 01:20:00.963 region:rollup2
BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.398 region:rollup2
NINETEEN WOULD BE BASED ON MUCH

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.999 region:rollup2
BETTER DATA SO WE AGREE THAT.

01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:04.633 region:rollup2
THEY'D.

01:20:03.999 --> 01:20:05.701 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH ANOTHER

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.568 region:rollup2
GEAR.

01:20:05.701 --> 01:20:09.104 region:rollup2
SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:20:06.568 --> 01:20:09.738 region:rollup2
INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:12.074 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD REVISE THE EXISTING

01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:13.842 region:rollup2
AND TIMELINES.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:15.778 region:rollup2
AND FOURTH THEM WE'RE PROPOSING

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:17.913 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THE EDUCATION TRAILER

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:18.914 region:rollup2
BILL FOR THAT TRAILER BILL FOR

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:21.083 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:22.785 region:rollup2
TO CAP THE INDIRECT COST RATE

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
THAT HOME.

01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:25.554 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND K.

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.423 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWELVE CHARGE THEIR

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:28.991 region:rollup2
ADULT EDUCATION PROVIDERS.

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:30.959 region:rollup2
WE WOULD CAP THIS AT NO MORE

01:20:28.991 --> 01:20:32.361 region:rollup2
THAN THE INDIRECT COST RATE THAT

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:34.496 region:rollup2
WAS CHARGED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:36.265 region:rollup2
OR AT NO MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:38.867 region:rollup2
OF THE I. EACH CONSORTIUMS THEM

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:40.002 region:rollup2
TOTAL THE EPG ALLOCATION. AND

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:41.337 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD THAT SOME ADULTS

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:43.005 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE BEING CHARGED TEN

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:44.506 region:rollup2
PERCENT OR GREATER IN THEIR

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:46.642 region:rollup2
INTEREST COST RATE.

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.242 region:rollup2
SO THAT ENHANCE MY COMMENTS ON

01:20:46.642 --> 01:20:49.912 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM AND I'M. HERE TO

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:53.682 region:rollup2
ANSWER QUESTIONS.

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:56.685 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:58.954 region:rollup2
OUR OFFICE WAS CHARGED WITH.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:21:01.356 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING UNRESOLVED ALIGNMENT

01:20:58.954 --> 01:21:01.557 region:rollup2
IN COORDINATION ISSUES.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:05.794 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:07.529 region:rollup2
.

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:08.797 region:rollup2
THEY CONTINUE TO IMPEDE THE

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:10.365 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF ADULT SCHOOLS AND

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.967 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO WORK

TOGETHER IN A COORDINATED WAY

01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:16.038 region:rollup2
AND TO SERVE STUDENTS IN A WAY.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2
THAT PROVIDES

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.674 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY EQUAL ACCESS

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:20.509 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ADULT

ON PAGE TEN.

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:34.623 region:rollup2
OF THOSE ISSUES THAT WE

01:21:32.855 --> 01:21:36.558 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED.

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:38.961 region:rollup2
THIS SERGEANT ACTUALLY USED THIS

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:41.130 region:rollup2
IS WELL AS THIS DISTRIBUTED A.

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:42.564 region:rollup2
THAT TABLE.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.466 region:rollup2
WHICH MIGHT BE EASIER FOR YOU

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:47.035 region:rollup2
TO READ.

01:21:44.466 --> 01:21:49.104 region:rollup2
AND SO. ALL GO THROUGH A KIND OF

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:51.206 region:rollup2
THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OF THAT.

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:53.075 region:rollup2
TABLE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:54.977 region:rollup2
WE'VE IDENTIFIED.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:57.312 region:rollup2
AND THEN BASED ON.

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:59.214 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WHAT WE OUTLINED HERE

01:21:57.312 --> 01:22:00.816 region:rollup2
THINK IT'LL HELP?

01:21:59.214 --> 01:22:02.518 region:rollup2
BETTER HELP YOU.

01:22:00.816 --> 01:22:04.386 region:rollup2
A BETTER UNDERSTAND.

AND BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:08.657 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS ON THE

AUGMENTATION.

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.460 region:rollup2
AND THAT FOUR POINT ONE PERCENT

01:22:10.426 --> 01:22:14.163 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION AND THEN THE DATA.

01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:17.699 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

01:22:14.163 --> 01:22:20.536 region:rollup2
SO JUST TO START.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:22.738 region:rollup2
ON THE TOP ROW OF THAT TABLE.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:25.607 region:rollup2
I NOTES THAT STUDENT IDENTIFIERS

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:26.175 region:rollup2
REMAIN AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:28.744 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:22:26.175 --> 01:22:30.646 region:rollup2
USE.

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:32.481 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

01:22:30.646 --> 01:22:33.782 region:rollup2
OR A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:35.184 region:rollup2
STUDENT DOESN'T HAVE A SOCIAL

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:37.019 region:rollup2
SECURITY NUMBER AND THEY USE

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:38.654 region:rollup2
THAT FOR TO PUT IT INTO THEIR

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:41.023 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:41.557 region:rollup2
AND TO FOLLOW STUDENTS AND SEE

01:22:41.023 --> 01:22:43.725 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE DOING LOOK AT

01:22:41.557 --> 01:22:45.194 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:22:43.725 --> 01:22:46.929 region:rollup2
K. TWELVE THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:48.764 region:rollup2
HAS A STATEWIDE STUDENT

01:22:46.929 --> 01:22:49.298 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIER UNIQUE IDENTIFIER FOR

01:22:48.764 --> 01:22:51.366 region:rollup2
EACH STUDENT THROUGH HIGH

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:52.801 region:rollup2
SCHOOL.

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:54.169 region:rollup2
BUT THEN WHAT'S THAT STUDENT THE

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.838 region:rollup2
STUDENT WERE TO LEAVE OR LET'S

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:57.139 region:rollup2
SAY DROP OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

01:22:55.838 --> 01:22:58.674 region:rollup2
RETURN AS ADULT STUDENTS.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.741 region:rollup2
GENERALLY ADULT SCHOOLS WOULD

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:01.510 region:rollup2
GIVE THAT STUDENT A LOCAL

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:03.045 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIER NOT THAT OLD

01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:05.047 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE STUDENT IDENTIFIER

01:23:03.045 --> 01:23:06.748 region:rollup2
GENERALLY ALSO. IF YOU HAVE A

01:23:05.047 --> 01:23:08.984 region:rollup2
STUDENT IT'S NOT FROM THAT

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:10.719 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GO TO K. TWELVE CASE GO

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:12.888 region:rollup2
THROUGH K. TWELVE IN CALIFORNIA

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:13.822 region:rollup2
THEY'LL GET. A LOCAL IDENTIFIER

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:15.357 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.859 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THESE IDENTIFIERS ARE

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:17.993 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FROM THE WHAT THE

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:19.528 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE SO YOU

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.728 region:rollup2
HAVE IS A SYSTEM.

01:23:19.528 --> 01:23:21.296 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:23.899 region:rollup2
.

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:26.268 region:rollup2
DOES NOT MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR

01:23:23.899 --> 01:23:28.203 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:29.905 region:rollup2
AND FOR CHANCES OFFICE AND

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:31.373 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PART OF EDUCATION NO

01:23:29.905 --> 01:23:32.808 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOR THAT MATTER. TO

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:34.977 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW THE STUDENTS ARE

01:23:32.808 --> 01:23:36.712 region:rollup2
DOING TO FOLLOW THEM FROM THE K.

01:23:34.977 --> 01:23:38.580 region:rollup2
TWELVE SYSTEM.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:40.482 region:rollup2
TWO ADULT EDUCATION.

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:42.317 region:rollup2
TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES MAYBE

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:43.752 region:rollup2
TO UNIVERSITY OF WORKFORCE AND

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.521 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S OF A BIG ISSUE

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.789 region:rollup2
AND WE RECOMMEND THAT ADULT

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:49.892 region:rollup2
SCHOOL START USING STATEWIDE

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:50.792 region:rollup2
STUDENT IDENTIFIERS.

01:23:49.892 --> 01:23:52.461 region:rollup2
AND IF THE IT THAT THAT A BILL

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:54.396 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENT WAS ONCE IN THE K.

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:56.031 region:rollup2
TWELVE SYSTEM TO GET THAT THAT

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:57.1000 region:rollup2
NUMBER BACK NUMBER THEN WE

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:59.835 region:rollup2
REQUIRE THAT. WE RECOMMEND THAT

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:01.470 region:rollup2
THE ADULT SCHOOLS SHARE THOSE

01:23:59.835 --> 01:24:02.704 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE IDENTIFIERS WITH THE

01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:04.006 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND PRETTY

01:24:02.704 --> 01:24:04.406 region:rollup2
MANY COLLEGES.

01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:06.208 region:rollup2
TO.

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:07.743 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE IDENTIFIERS IN

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.911 region:rollup2
THEIR DATA SYSTEM

01:24:07.743 --> 01:24:11.146 region:rollup2
SEC THAT'S ONE ISSUE IN IN THE

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:11.847 region:rollup2
SO COME BACK YOU WILL COME BACK

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:15.384 region:rollup2
TO THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:16.919 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSALS ON DATA.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.186 region:rollup2
I WILL NOT GO THROUGH EACH ONE

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:20.422 region:rollup2
OF THESE BUT THE HIGHLIGHT THE

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:22.457 region:rollup2
MAJOR ONES AS FAR AS A LINEMAN

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:25.093 region:rollup2

FUNDING. AND COURSE FEES

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. THE STATE OF

CALIFORNIA HAS VERY DIFFERENT

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.267 region:rollup2
FUNDING POLICIES AND FEE

01:24:30.632 --> 01:24:33.669 region:rollup2

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:40.709 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RELY

01:24:38.674 --> 01:24:42.311 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY ON A PORTION MINUTES

01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:43.812 region:rollup2
FOR ADULT ADD.

INSTRUCTION.

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:47.316 region:rollup2
WHICH THEY CALL NON CREDIT AND

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:49.584 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SET

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:51.286 region:rollup2
S. STATUTORILY STACKED SET. UP

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.820 region:rollup2

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:08.617 region:rollup2
IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I I

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:10.118 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IN THE. EARLIER ITEM

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:11.920 region:rollup2

SIMILAR CONTENT YET STATE HAS

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:20.295 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:21.696 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR WHAT.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:22.197 region:rollup2
IT'S TEACHER NEEDS TO HAVE IN

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:23.632 region:rollup2
ORDER TO TEACH IN THOSE

PROGRAMS.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:27.202 region:rollup2
AND IF THE IF THE INSTRUCTORS

WITHOUT A TEACHING CREDENTIAL

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:45.287 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.822 region:rollup2
DROP THAT A CREDENTIALING

01:28:45.287 --> 01:28:49.791 region:rollup2

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:09.530 region:rollup2
ADULT ED PROGRAMS THE SECOND IS

01:36:07.295 --> 01:36:11.165 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TO IMPROVE QUALITY BY

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:13.001 region:rollup2
LEAVING DECISIONS UP TO THE

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:15.303 region:rollup2
LOCAL CONSORTIA TO FIGURE OUT

01:36:13.001 --> 01:36:16.437 region:rollup2
WHICH ARE THE. MOST APPROPRIATE

01:36:15.303 --> 01:36:18.239 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TO.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:20.842 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL.

01:36:18.239 --> 01:36:22.343 region:rollup2
FUNDING TWO AND THREE TO BUILD

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:23.144 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF IN THE

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.912 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS GUIDED

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:26.781 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS THAT WE THINK IT MAKES

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:28.483 region:rollup2
SENSE TO. THROUGH THE CONSORTIA

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:30.685 region:rollup2
YOU LIKELY HAVE IMPROVED

01:36:28.483 --> 01:36:32.353 region:rollup2
TRANSITIONS FROM AND ACROSS

01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:33.087 region:rollup2
ADULT SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:34.989 region:rollup2
AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN THE

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:36.724 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. OF MUCH OF THE

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:37.725 region:rollup2
INITIAL WORK ON WHETHER WE'RE

01:36:36.724 --> 01:36:39.727 region:rollup2
ACHIEVING THAT IS.

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:40.595 region:rollup2
IS IN OUR DRAFT REPORT WHICH

01:36:39.727 --> 01:36:43.464 region:rollup2
THE.

01:36:40.595 --> 01:36:45.500 region:rollup2
YOUR AGENDA SUMMARIZES.

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:47.835 region:rollup2
BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR ABOUT HOW

01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:49.671 region:rollup2
WE GET MONEY FROM THE STATE TO

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:51.506 region:rollup2
BE CONSORTIA THAT WE HAVE A

01:36:49.671 --> 01:36:52.473 region:rollup2
FORMULA IT'S NOT ENROLLMENT SURE

01:36:51.506 --> 01:36:54.309 region:rollup2
OF AND THAT WE HAVE A FORMULA

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:55.910 region:rollup2
THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SIZE

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:56.944 region:rollup2
OF THE ADULT POPULATION.

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:59.047 region:rollup2
SCOTT MET MEASURES AROUND

01:36:56.944 --> 01:37:01.082 region:rollup2
LITERACY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT

01:36:59.047 --> 01:37:02.116 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT AND IMMIGRATION. AND

01:37:01.082 --> 01:37:05.053 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:37:02.116 --> 01:37:06.821 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM SIZING CAPACITY SO. I

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:07.822 region:rollup2
DID IT I THINK WERE HAPPIER THAT

01:37:06.821 --> 01:37:09.357 region:rollup2
I KIND OF HAVE A DISCUSSION

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:11.059 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT THESE PER STUDENT

01:37:09.357 --> 01:37:12.994 region:rollup2
FUNDING RATES ARE AT THE

01:37:11.059 --> 01:37:14.329 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA SPENDING RATES. BUT I

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.396 region:rollup2
DO THINK WE THINK IT.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
.

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:18.800 region:rollup2
A FORMULA FROM THE STATE LEVEL

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:19.934 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:21.269 region:rollup2
THINGS OTHER THAN.

01:37:19.934 --> 01:37:22.770 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT AT THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:37:21.269 --> 01:37:23.604 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT NEED I THINK YOU

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.972 region:rollup2
CAN DO BOTH BUT WE SHOULD

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:26.808 region:rollup2
PROBABLY HAVE A CONVERSATION

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:28.276 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW YOU DO THAT. ARMED

01:37:26.808 --> 01:37:29.677 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD AGAIN ON MINIMUM

01:37:28.276 --> 01:37:30.912 region:rollup2
QUALIFICATIONS I THINK THAT'S

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:31.779 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:37:30.912 --> 01:37:33.247 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGED AS PART OF OUR

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:34.615 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. AND ARE HAPPY TO WORK

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.516 region:rollup2
WITH YOU.

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:39.754 region:rollup2
TO THINK HOW WE DO THAT.

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:43.391 region:rollup2
TAKE QUESTIONS.

01:37:39.754 --> 01:37:44.826 region:rollup2
YEAH BUT.

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:49.397 region:rollup2
QUESTION AUTUMN BUT FIRST MR

01:37:44.826 --> 01:37:52.066 region:rollup2
CHAVIS.

01:37:49.397 --> 01:37:53.401 region:rollup2
WELL THIS REPORT REFLECTS.

01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:54.669 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE GUIDANCE THAT WE

01:37:53.401 --> 01:37:56.003 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH BACK IN TWENTY

01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:58.072 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN.

01:37:56.003 --> 01:38:00.141 region:rollup2
WHEN WE.

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:02.877 region:rollup2
WELL THE PROPOSAL BY DEPARTMENT

01:38:00.141 --> 01:38:05.646 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE WAS TO. DEFUND ADULT

01:38:02.877 --> 01:38:07.181 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AND.

01:38:05.646 --> 01:38:08.216 region:rollup2
AND EVERY WAS LIKE UP AT ARMS

01:38:07.181 --> 01:38:10.818 region:rollup2
BACK AT TWELVE THIRTEEN I

01:38:08.216 --> 01:38:12.620 region:rollup2
REMEMBER. IT WAS MY FIRST

01:38:10.818 --> 01:38:14.389 region:rollup2
SESSION BEING HERE SO.

01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.356 region:rollup2
WE WENT PUSH BACK ON THAT AND WE

01:38:14.389 --> 01:38:16.724 region:rollup2
ASK FOR HISTORICAL PRESENTATION

01:38:15.356 --> 01:38:18.359 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:16.724 --> 01:38:20.194 region:rollup2
WAS INTERESTING ONE OF THE FIRST

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:21.596 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION WE HAD

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:23.364 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BAKKEN.

01:38:21.596 --> 01:38:25.700 region:rollup2
FORMATION OF THIS.

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:27.235 region:rollup2
STATE NINETEEN SIXTY WAS ADULT

01:38:25.700 --> 01:38:29.570 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FOR LITERACY.

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:31.639 region:rollup2
AND FOR CITIZENSHIP.

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:33.274 region:rollup2
AND SO FOUND OUT IT HAD A WHOLE

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:34.942 region:rollup2
HISTORY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:35.109 region:rollup2
THE STATE AND WHERE WE'RE GOING.

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.744 region:rollup2
AND.

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:37.845 region:rollup2
.

01:38:36.744 --> 01:38:38.880 region:rollup2
SO WE ASKED HIM TO GO BACK AND

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:41.048 region:rollup2
LOOK AT.

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:43.284 region:rollup2
HOW WE COULD?

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:46.354 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE UNIQUENESS OF A RURAL

01:38:43.284 --> 01:38:48.156 region:rollup2
AREA IN AN URBAN AREA AND WHO IS

01:38:46.354 --> 01:38:49.891 region:rollup2
DOING THIS TO HIGH SCHOOLS. OR

01:38:48.156 --> 01:38:50.425 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHAT

01:38:49.891 --> 01:38:51.993 region:rollup2
WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO

01:38:50.425 --> 01:38:53.294 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THAT BACK AT THE SAME

01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:54.929 region:rollup2
TIME WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION

01:38:53.294 --> 01:38:56.564 region:rollup2
TWELVE THIRTEEN. THERE WAS THE

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:58.199 region:rollup2
INTRODUCTION THE LOCAL CONTROL

01:38:56.564 --> 01:39:00.568 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND HAVING PEOPLE

01:38:58.199 --> 01:39:01.169 region:rollup2
LOCALLY BEST MAKE THE DECISIONS

01:39:00.568 --> 01:39:02.069 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T DECIDED AT THE STATE

01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:03.771 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:05.840 region:rollup2
SO THIS KIND OF FOLLOWED IN WITH

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:08.009 region:rollup2
THAT WHOLE DISCUSSION.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.410 region:rollup2

THE GOING ONS OF. EVERYTHING THE

01:39:43.578 --> 01:39:45.780 region:rollup2

AS I THINK I WOULD FIND

01:42:00.348 --> 01:42:04.285 region:rollup2

01:43:20.194 --> 01:43:23.731 region:rollup2
AND ALSO AS FAR AS HOW MUCH THAT

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:26.167 region:rollup2
WOULD COST.

01:43:23.731 --> 01:43:26.667 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:43:26.167 --> 01:43:29.303 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY. DID DIE AN

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:36.677 region:rollup2
IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE FORTY TO

01:43:35.743 --> 01:43:38.145 region:rollup2
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ARE

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:40.848 region:rollup2

DON'T ADD CT  <u><c.green>GOTCHA YET</c></u>

01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:56.197 region:rollup2

CHARGE YES STUDENTS FOR ANY SL

01:44:03.804 --> 01:44:06.107 region:rollup2
INABILITY THAT GETS RIGHT.

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:07.308 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE

01:44:06.107 --> 01:44:08.943 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO CONSIDER IS NOT A

01:44:07.308 --> 01:44:10.878 region:rollup2

INFORMATION IDENTIFIERS AND

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:20.020 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:21.689 region:rollup2
IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS AND SO I'M

01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.390 region:rollup2
WONDERING HOW THAT'S WORKING NOW

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:25.426 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY.

01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:26.961 region:rollup2
WE'VE HEARD LAST YEAR WITH THIS

01:44:25.426 --> 01:44:28.095 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PEOPLE ARE

01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:30.131 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES LESS LIKELY TO GIVE

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:32.233 region:rollup2
INFORMATION SELF.

01:44:30.131 --> 01:44:33.501 region:rollup2

PARTICIPATE IN IT TWENTY FIVE

01:44:41.041 --> 01:44:44.445 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO TO GET MY.

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:46.614 region:rollup2
I SCHOOL DIPLOMA SELDON HAVE

NOTE THAT.

01:44:46.881 --> 01:44:50.217 region:rollup2
.

01:44:48.115 --> 01:44:51.952 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT WE WE

01:44:50.217 --> 01:44:54.054 region:rollup2
ARE APPROPRIATION BEFORE THE

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:57.057 region:rollup2
RECESSION WAS WAS HIGHER IT WAS

01:44:54.054 --> 01:44:58.526 region:rollup2
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION RIGHT.

01:44:57.057 --> 01:44:59.760 region:rollup2
THAT'S RIGHT YEAH YEAH SO WE'RE

01:44:58.526 --> 01:45:00.427 region:rollup2
BACK OUT OF OUR LIVES HUNDRED

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.163 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN A BIG

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:02.730 region:rollup2
RELIEF AND. AND I I AM STILL

01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:03.931 region:rollup2

.

01:45:05.299 --> 01:45:08.869 region:rollup2
THE DEMAND IS OUT THERE IF WE

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:10.504 region:rollup2
ARE. FILLING ALL THE NEEDS AND I

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:12.039 region:rollup2

.

01:45:14.108 --> 01:45:17.745 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO CONTINUE TO ASK

01:45:16.210 --> 01:45:19.513 region:rollup2
THAT CAN PASS THAT DEPARTMENT OF

01:45:17.745 --> 01:45:21.015 region:rollup2
FINANCE FOR HER OTHER STATE TO

NEED TO LOOK ABOUT.

01:45:23.784 --> 01:45:26.987 region:rollup2
I'VE GOING GREATER AND AND ALSO

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:28.455 region:rollup2

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:30.624 region:rollup2
OF ADULT THAT.

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:32.326 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOME THINGS YOU CAN'T

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:34.094 region:rollup2
ALWAYS QUANTIFY LET'S SAY

01:45:32.326 --> 01:45:36.430 region:rollup2

GRADE READING LEVEL TO A SEVENTH

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.899 region:rollup2
GRADE IS THAT A CERTIFICATE.

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:41.035 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:42.636 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT A TREMENDOUS UPSIDE IN

01:45:41.035 --> 01:45:45.372 region:rollup2
IT AND THE SUCCESS HELPING.

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:46.907 region:rollup2
PEOPLE I GET BETTER SKILLS TO BE

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:48.809 region:rollup2

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:50.778 region:rollup2
CITIZEN IN CALIFORNIA WITH

CALIFORNIA IS SO MUCH GREATER

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.029 region:rollup2
AND SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD

01:46:08.062 --> 01:46:10.531 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD LOSE.

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:12.299 region:rollup2
A FOCUS ON THAT AT AS WELL.

01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:12.867 region:rollup2

02:00:30.223 --> 02:00:33.760 region:rollup2
OUR PROPOSAL EXPANDS ON THESE

CT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALON

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:05.358 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSAL

02:01:03.556 --> 02:01:06.760 region:rollup2
AT AN EARLIER HEARING SO. RATHER

02:01:05.358 --> 02:01:08.762 region:rollup2
THAN REPEAT ALL THOSE POINTS I'M

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:10.029 region:rollup2
JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS A

02:01:08.762 --> 02:01:11.965 region:rollup2
THE.

02:01:10.029 --> 02:01:14.334 region:rollup2
TWO ALTERNATIVES THAT WE'VE.

02:01:11.965 --> 02:01:15.468 region:rollup2
PUT FORWARD AND HOW THOSE

02:01:14.334 --> 02:01:17.170 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES WOULD ADDRESS SOME

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:18.638 region:rollup2
OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE

02:01:17.170 --> 02:01:20.607 region:rollup2
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. SO

02:01:18.638 --> 02:01:23.743 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT WE RECOMMEND

02:01:20.607 --> 02:01:24.844 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE STATE FUNDS CTE

02:01:23.743 --> 02:01:26.246 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LCF APPROACH WE

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:28.381 region:rollup2
THINK THIS HAS.

02:01:26.246 --> 02:01:29.516 region:rollup2
NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES OVER THE

02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:31.951 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL APPROACH BUT

02:01:29.516 --> 02:01:33.520 region:rollup2
PRIMARILY WE THINK IT EMPHASIZES

02:01:31.951 --> 02:01:35.722 region:rollup2
THAT CT IS PART OF THE CORE

02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:36.489 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC CURRICULUM. OF A HIGH

02:01:35.722 --> 02:01:38.358 region:rollup2
SCHOOL EDUCATION

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:40.560 region:rollup2
A.

02:01:38.358 --> 02:01:42.695 region:rollup2
SO RATHER THAN DISTRICTS BEING

02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.464 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH OUR WE ARE

02:01:42.695 --> 02:01:45.598 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATING IN A CATEGORICAL

02:01:44.464 --> 02:01:47.534 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND.

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:49.903 region:rollup2
ARE WE MEETING THE SPECIFIC

02:01:47.534 --> 02:01:51.271 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF OF THAT PROGRAM

02:01:49.903 --> 02:01:53.273 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR

02:01:51.271 --> 02:01:54.974 region:rollup2
THEIR OBLIGATION IS NOT LIMITED

02:01:53.273 --> 02:01:56.843 region:rollup2
JUST TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT

02:01:54.974 --> 02:01:58.344 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC PROGRAM. NOW THEY'RE IN

02:01:56.843 --> 02:01:59.846 region:rollup2
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS

02:01:58.344 --> 02:02:01.214 region:rollup2
WITH THE LC FF APPROACH FOR

02:01:59.846 --> 02:02:03.049 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE.

02:02:01.214 --> 02:02:04.551 region:rollup2
IT IS ZOOMS THAT DISTRICTS ARE

02:02:03.049 --> 02:02:07.220 region:rollup2
BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR.

02:02:04.551 --> 02:02:09.556 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PROVIDING APPROPRIATE

02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:11.124 region:rollup2
CT FOR THE THIRD STUDENTS

02:02:09.556 --> 02:02:12.292 region:rollup2
THAT STATE ONLY RECENTLY

02:02:11.124 --> 02:02:14.093 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED ITS COLLEGE AND

02:02:12.292 --> 02:02:16.429 region:rollup2
CAREER READINESS INDICATOR BUT

02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:17.764 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE COULD. MODIFIER

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:19.632 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENED THAT IF IT WAS

02:02:17.764 --> 02:02:21.067 region:rollup2
CONCERNED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:23.570 region:rollup2
O. ALTERNATIVELY IF THE.

02:02:21.067 --> 02:02:24.504 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE WERE CONCERNED THAT

02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:26.239 region:rollup2
NOT ENOUGH FUNDING WERE

02:02:24.504 --> 02:02:27.507 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE IT COULD PROVIDE AN

02:02:26.239 --> 02:02:29.509 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BOMP.

02:02:27.507 --> 02:02:31.244 region:rollup2
TO THE HIGH SCHOOL EL CFF BASE

02:02:29.509 --> 02:02:33.880 region:rollup2
RATE.

02:02:31.244 --> 02:02:35.748 region:rollup2
NOW IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:37.550 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN FUNDING CT USING A

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:39.285 region:rollup2
CATEGORICAL APPROACH WE DO THINK

02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:42.021 region:rollup2
THAT THE EXISTING CD INCENTIVE

02:02:39.285 --> 02:02:43.723 region:rollup2
GRANT PROGRAM HAS. OF SEVERAL

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:45.425 region:rollup2
ADVANTAGES OVER AT THE

02:02:43.723 --> 02:02:47.560 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL A IN

02:02:45.425 --> 02:02:50.363 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IT OFFERS MORE

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:52.865 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY FOR A SCHOOLS TO

02:02:50.363 --> 02:02:54.534 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. A CD PATHWAYS THAT

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:56.869 region:rollup2
MIGHT NOT BE ALIGNED WITH THEIR

02:02:54.534 --> 02:02:58.872 region:rollup2
REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS BUT.

02:02:56.869 --> 02:03:01.040 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OFFER BENEFITS.

02:02:58.872 --> 02:03:02.542 region:rollup2
AT SUCH AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.443 region:rollup2
BUT WE ALSO THINK THAT THE

02:03:02.542 --> 02:03:05.178 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOESN'T

02:03:03.443 --> 02:03:07.380 region:rollup2
PROPERLY LEVERAGE THE EXISTING

02:03:05.178 --> 02:03:07.547 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:10.049 region:rollup2
IT.

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:12.352 region:rollup2

SCHOOL CT PROGRAMS.

02:03:13.586 --> 02:03:18.191 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THE THE CT

02:03:15.955 --> 02:03:18.725 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM COULD BE

02:03:18.191 --> 02:03:20.860 region:rollup2
IMPROVED UPON ITS CURRENT

02:03:18.725 --> 02:03:23.062 region:rollup2
DESIGN.

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:27.300 region:rollup2
IT FOR INSTANCE COULD.

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:30.003 region:rollup2
BE MODIFIED TO INCLUDE.

02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:32.071 region:rollup2

CT PROGRAMS THAT OF REMAIN

02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:35.942 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF.

02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:38.211 region:rollup2
BOTH THE INCENTIVE GRANT AND VLC

02:03:35.942 --> 02:03:40.613 region:rollup2
FF APPROACH IT AND CONTRIBUTE TO

02:10:18.678 --> 02:10:20.846 region:rollup2

DIRECTION OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

02:12:52.231 --> 02:12:55.467 region:rollup2
ABOUT HERE IN TERMS OF THIS.

02:12:53.833 --> 02:12:57.036 region:rollup2
REGIONALIZATION YOU KNOW BECAUSE

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:58.537 region:rollup2
IT'S IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT IT

02:12:57.036 --> 02:12:59.939 region:rollup2
JUST MAKES COMMON SENSE. THAT

02:12:58.537 --> 02:13:01.407 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NORTH HIGH SCHOOL

02:12:59.939 --> 02:13:02.875 region:rollup2

AND SO YOU KNOW THIS RITA

02:13:07.513 --> 02:13:11.217 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CONSORTIUM IDEA IN A

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:13.052 region:rollup2
WHILE IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE

02:13:11.217 --> 02:13:13.786 region:rollup2
THEY YOU ALIGN ALL THE. BE THERE

02:13:13.052 --> 02:13:15.988 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

02:13:13.786 --> 02:13:17.590 region:rollup2
THE INDUSTRY NEEDS A AT A

02:13:15.988 --> 02:13:18.958 region:rollup2
REGIONAL LEVEL AND AND AND YOU

02:13:17.590 --> 02:13:19.959 region:rollup2

ENROLLMENT AND SO FORTH. BUT

02:13:21.994 --> 02:13:24.964 region:rollup2
IT'S IT SEEMS LIKE.

02:13:23.462 --> 02:13:26.098 region:rollup2
THAT GOES AGAINST SOME OF THE

02:13:24.964 --> 02:13:27.600 region:rollup2
BASIC REALITIES OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:13:26.098 --> 02:13:29.702 region:rollup2
STUDENTS

02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:30.970 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GONNA STAY. WERE

02:13:29.702 --> 02:13:32.938 region:rollup2
WHAT'S OF TWO WORDS BUT FAMILIAR

02:13:30.970 --> 02:13:33.572 region:rollup2
TO THEM

02:13:32.938 --> 02:13:34.440 region:rollup2
AND ELECTED A SKIT AND THEY'RE

02:13:33.572 --> 02:13:35.574 region:rollup2
GONNA THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO STAY

02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:37.343 region:rollup2
AT THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS IN AND SO

02:13:35.574 --> 02:13:39.678 region:rollup2
TO ME.

YOU KNOW. I I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:43.249 region:rollup2
HOW THE THIS REGIONAL CONSORTIUM

02:13:41.547 --> 02:13:45.417 region:rollup2
IDEA. WOULD.

02:13:43.249 --> 02:13:46.919 region:rollup2
BE CONSISTENT WITH THE REALITY

02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:48.454 region:rollup2
OF OUR MOST STUDENTS WOULD WANNA

02:13:46.919 --> 02:13:49.955 region:rollup2
GO TO WHAT'S MOST CONVENIENT AND

02:13:48.454 --> 02:13:51.257 region:rollup2
WAS MOST FAMILIAR TO THEM WHICH

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:52.658 region:rollup2
IS STAYING AT THEIR OWN SCHOOLS

02:13:51.257 --> 02:13:54.693 region:rollup2
AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. OF

02:13:52.658 --> 02:13:56.495 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:07.406 region:rollup2
GO FIRST ON THIS BUT I THINK THE

02:14:06.705 --> 02:14:09.775 region:rollup2
IDEA.

02:14:07.406 --> 02:14:12.044 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS THERE

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:13.379 region:rollup2
TO DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE

02:14:12.044 --> 02:14:14.947 region:rollup2
TORRANCE AREA AND THAT ARE

02:14:13.379 --> 02:14:16.382 region:rollup2
OFFERING THE SAME PROGRAM RIGHT

02:14:14.947 --> 02:14:18.617 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK. YOU KNOW

02:14:16.382 --> 02:14:20.419 region:rollup2
AERONAUTICAL DESIGN AND WHATEVER

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:21.854 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY EXTENSIVE BURKE OR

02:14:20.419 --> 02:14:23.222 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE KIND

02:14:21.854 --> 02:14:23.589 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE

02:14:23.222 --> 02:14:25.691 region:rollup2
BEEN WHAT THAT.

02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:27.359 region:rollup2
.

02:14:25.691 --> 02:14:29.094 region:rollup2
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD MAKE

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:30.529 region:rollup2
SENSE FOR. ONE OF THOSE HIGH

02:14:29.094 --> 02:14:32.331 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:33.766 region:rollup2
TO OFFER THIS PROGRAM.

02:14:32.331 --> 02:14:35.200 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW IN PART

02:14:33.766 --> 02:14:36.535 region:rollup2
FUNDED THROUGH THE THE

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:38.170 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:39.772 region:rollup2
IN THE STRONG WORK FORCE. AND

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:40.673 region:rollup2
THEN SIMILAR TO DUAL ENROLLMENT

02:14:39.772 --> 02:14:42.207 region:rollup2
MORE YOU HAVE HIGH SCHOOL

02:14:40.673 --> 02:14:43.342 region:rollup2
STUDENTS GOING TO THEIR LOCAL

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:44.510 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:14:43.342 --> 02:14:45.778 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE COURTS THERE AND

02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:47.346 region:rollup2
THEY ACTUALLY GET HIGH SCHOOL

02:14:45.778 --> 02:14:47.880 region:rollup2
PREDICT FOR THOSE COURSES. YOU

02:14:47.346 --> 02:14:49.949 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE STUDENTS TAKING

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:52.084 region:rollup2
THESE.

02:14:49.949 --> 02:14:54.153 region:rollup2
AERONAUTICAL TRAINING COURSES

02:14:52.084 --> 02:14:56.522 region:rollup2
THAT THIS ONE HIGH SCHOOL RATHER

02:14:54.153 --> 02:14:57.122 region:rollup2
THAN HAVING BOTH SCHOOLS

02:14:56.522 --> 02:14:59.658 region:rollup2
SPEND THEIR MONEY ON THE SAME

02:14:57.122 --> 02:15:00.826 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. YET SO I KNOW THAT THAT

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:01.026 region:rollup2
IS THE IDEAL THAT YOUR YOUR.

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:02.494 region:rollup2
YOUR.

02:15:01.026 --> 02:15:04.630 region:rollup2
.

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:05.965 region:rollup2
BASING YOUR PROPOSAL ON THAT

02:15:04.630 --> 02:15:07.700 region:rollup2
BUT I'M SAYING THAT THAT GOES

02:15:05.965 --> 02:15:08.901 region:rollup2
AGAINST THE REALITY OF STUDENTS

02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:10.703 region:rollup2
WHO WANT TO STAY AT THEIR OWN

02:15:08.901 --> 02:15:12.137 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS.

02:15:10.703 --> 02:15:13.639 region:rollup2
AND SO WHILE THEM IT MAY NOT BE

02:15:12.137 --> 02:15:15.374 region:rollup2
THE MOST.

02:15:13.639 --> 02:15:17.376 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY FISH AND I THINK

02:15:15.374 --> 02:15:18.777 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN ARGUMENT FOR. THE ARE

02:15:17.376 --> 02:15:21.113 region:rollup2
OCP THAT THEY HAVE THE.

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:21.981 region:rollup2
.

02:15:21.113 --> 02:15:24.450 region:rollup2
THE CAPITAL INTENSIVE.

02:15:21.981 --> 02:15:26.318 region:rollup2
A CT PROGRAMS.

02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:28.721 region:rollup2
BROUGH PROVIDED AT A REGIONAL

02:15:26.318 --> 02:15:30.089 region:rollup2
LEVEL BUT I I AM JUST SAYING

02:15:28.721 --> 02:15:31.223 region:rollup2
THERE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

02:15:30.089 --> 02:15:32.791 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT I'M WITNESS

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:34.360 region:rollup2
HERE THEY THAT SEEMS TO MAKE

02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:36.362 region:rollup2
SENSE TO ME THAT STUDENTS WILL.

02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:37.863 region:rollup2
DO WHAT IS CAN IT WAS CONVENIENT

02:15:36.362 --> 02:15:39.264 region:rollup2
AND AND AND FAMILIAR TO THEM

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:43.002 region:rollup2
STATE THEIR OWN SCHOOL.

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:44.503 region:rollup2
SO I I I JUST WANTED TO.

02:15:43.002 --> 02:15:46.238 region:rollup2
RATE IT YOU KNOW SHARE THAT

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:47.706 region:rollup2
OBSERVATION.

02:15:46.238 --> 02:15:50.442 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO GO AGAINST

02:15:47.706 --> 02:15:52.344 region:rollup2
THE EFFORTS FOR REGIONALS.

02:15:50.442 --> 02:15:54.046 region:rollup2
AND I JUST HAD TO.

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:55.681 region:rollup2
I I UNDERSTAND THE POINT YOU'RE

02:15:54.046 --> 02:15:57.216 region:rollup2
MAKING ABOUT STUDENTS WANTING TO

02:15:55.681 --> 02:15:58.751 region:rollup2
STAY IN PROGRAMS AND SO EXCITING

02:15:57.216 --> 02:16:00.619 region:rollup2
FOR FAMILIAR TO THEM.

02:15:58.751 --> 02:16:01.186 region:rollup2
BUT THE REALITY TOO IS ALSO

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:03.022 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH SCHOOL WAS A FOUR

02:16:01.186 --> 02:16:05.090 region:rollup2
YEAR.

02:16:03.022 --> 02:16:06.458 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EXPERIENCE. AND WE WANT

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:08.660 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:10.462 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:11.797 region:rollup2
PATHWAYS TO GO INTO NON COMEDIC

02:16:10.462 --> 02:16:13.699 region:rollup2
COLLEGE OR CAREER AND THAT'S

02:16:11.797 --> 02:16:17.669 region:rollup2
REALLY THE GENESIS BEHIND THIS

02:16:13.699 --> 02:16:19.872 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:21.440 region:rollup2

MISSION THAN EVER BEFORE IN OUR

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:31.116 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS

02:16:29.882 --> 02:16:32.418 region:rollup2

THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

02:16:50.869 --> 02:16:54.139 region:rollup2
UNDER THE GOVERNANCE.

02:16:52.638 --> 02:16:55.340 region:rollup2

COLLEGES I STILL DON'T SEE.

02:16:57.476 --> 02:17:00.846 region:rollup2
WHY WE DO THIS IT SETS OR VERY

02:16:59.111 --> 02:17:03.015 region:rollup2
POOR PRECEDENCE?

02:17:00.846 --> 02:17:05.050 region:rollup2
FOR BETWEEN ECOLOGY MANAGING K.

02:17:03.015 --> 02:17:07.052 region:rollup2
TWELVE OPERATIONS IN SOME SENSE

02:17:05.050 --> 02:17:08.587 region:rollup2
ON CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:10.155 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE CONSORTIUM.

02:17:08.587 --> 02:17:11.490 region:rollup2
WE HEARD SOME CONCERNS FROM THE

02:17:10.155 --> 02:17:13.358 region:rollup2
ADULT ED COMMUNITY ABOUT THE

02:17:11.490 --> 02:17:14.293 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM MODEL. TO ME IT'S

02:17:13.358 --> 02:17:15.427 region:rollup2
JUST YOU KNOW THE MONEY IS GONNA

02:17:14.293 --> 02:17:17.396 region:rollup2
GET DOWN IT'S GONNA GO INTO

02:17:15.427 --> 02:17:18.831 region:rollup2
OUTER SPACETHAT'S GOING ON THE

02:17:17.396 --> 02:17:20.165 region:rollup2
SOVIET BLOC IT'S GONNA GET LOST.

02:17:18.831 --> 02:17:20.332 region:rollup2
THERE'S GONNA BE FIGHTING OVER

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:22.134 region:rollup2
IT.

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:23.435 region:rollup2
WHY WOULDN'T THERE BE FIGHTING

02:17:22.134 --> 02:17:24.636 region:rollup2
OVER

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:25.604 region:rollup2
I MEAN IF YOU'RE ON THAT

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:27.039 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA YOU'RE GONNA FIGHT

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:28.674 region:rollup2
FEAR OF DISTRICT?

02:17:27.039 --> 02:17:30.476 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU'RE NOT IN AN EQUAL

02:17:28.674 --> 02:17:31.009 region:rollup2
PLACE I JUST.

02:17:30.476 --> 02:17:33.946 region:rollup2
I JUST I DON'T. TRUST THAT

02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:36.248 region:rollup2
MODEL.

02:17:33.946 --> 02:17:37.483 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'D I I'D SAY IT'S

02:17:36.248 --> 02:17:39.051 region:rollup2
INHERENT THAT POLITICS WILL PLAN

02:17:37.483 --> 02:17:41.253 region:rollup2
TO WEAR AND IN THE INCENTIVE

02:17:39.051 --> 02:17:43.422 region:rollup2
GRANT. I'M PRETTY CLEAR IT'S AN

02:17:41.253 --> 02:17:43.989 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE GRANT OF YOU KNOW

02:17:43.422 --> 02:17:44.823 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO EAVIS

02:17:43.989 --> 02:17:46.992 region:rollup2
SERRATED.

02:17:44.823 --> 02:17:47.559 region:rollup2
I WATCHED IT.

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:48.961 region:rollup2
BEING OF HISTORY TO THE HIGH

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:50.062 region:rollup2
SCHOOL LEVEL.

02:17:48.961 --> 02:17:52.030 region:rollup2
WE'VE A SERRATED.

02:17:52.030 --> 02:17:54.733 region:rollup2
KERR TECH LOCATIONAL EDUCATION

02:17:53.365 --> 02:17:56.034 region:rollup2
NOW WE HAVE TO BUILD A BACK THE

02:17:54.733 --> 02:17:57.736 region:rollup2
INCENTIVE IS THE BEST WAITED DO

02:17:56.034 --> 02:17:59.338 region:rollup2
I THINK THE INCENTIVE. MODEL

02:17:57.736 --> 02:18:01.240 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BUYS INTO THE L. CFF

02:17:59.338 --> 02:18:02.841 region:rollup2
MODEL TO AS WELL MORE SO THAN

02:18:01.240 --> 02:18:05.010 region:rollup2
THAN THAN THAN THE OTHER.

02:18:02.841 --> 02:18:06.912 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM MODEL.

02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:08.180 region:rollup2
BOB. PUT BUT GOING ON A MISSION

02:18:06.912 --> 02:18:09.248 region:rollup2
WITH TEN I'M HEARING TODAY'S RUN

02:18:08.180 --> 02:18:11.150 region:rollup2
LIKE I'M I'M HEARING OR WAS

02:18:09.248 --> 02:18:11.750 region:rollup2
GOING TO THE GERMAN MODEL WHERE

02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:12.985 region:rollup2
YOU PICK YOUR LANE IN SEVENTH

02:18:11.750 --> 02:18:13.585 region:rollup2
GRADE.

02:18:12.985 --> 02:18:14.853 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING

02:18:13.585 --> 02:18:16.288 region:rollup2
TO BE.

02:18:14.853 --> 02:18:17.589 region:rollup2
MET THAT WORRIES ME BECAUSE I

02:18:16.288 --> 02:18:19.758 region:rollup2
HEAR A LOT OF TALK ABOUT STRONG

02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:20.859 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE AND ALMOST. ADULTS

02:18:19.758 --> 02:18:22.794 region:rollup2
MORE SO THAN CHILDREN MERRILEES

02:18:20.859 --> 02:18:23.829 region:rollup2
OUR KIDS WE WANT THESE PROGRAMS

02:18:22.794 --> 02:18:24.930 region:rollup2
A MIDDLE SCHOOLS WE WANT THEM

02:18:23.829 --> 02:18:26.365 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOLS.

02:18:24.930 --> 02:18:27.966 region:rollup2
AND WE WANT STUDENTS TO THERE'S

02:18:26.365 --> 02:18:30.102 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF PURPOSES WERE

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:31.837 region:rollup2
OFFERING CT IT'S NOT JUST THAT

02:18:30.102 --> 02:18:33.105 region:rollup2
IN SEVENTH GRADE YOU'RE GONNA

02:18:31.837 --> 02:18:33.972 region:rollup2
DECIDE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE.

02:18:33.105 --> 02:18:35.207 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING ADVANCED

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:36.575 region:rollup2
MANUFACTURING THAT'S WE'RE GOING

02:18:35.207 --> 02:18:37.876 region:rollup2
TO GO IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE YOU

02:18:36.575 --> 02:18:39.344 region:rollup2
KNOW STUDENTS LEARNING STEM

02:18:37.876 --> 02:18:40.379 region:rollup2
SKILLS STUDENTS GROWING.

02:18:39.344 --> 02:18:42.681 region:rollup2
STUDENTS SEEING WHAT

02:18:40.379 --> 02:18:43.515 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES THEY MIGHT SEE AS

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:44.850 region:rollup2
A FIT FOR THEM.

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:46.418 region:rollup2
SO I I'D I I HOPE WE'RE NOT

02:18:44.850 --> 02:18:47.619 region:rollup2
TRACKING IN THE SEVENTH GRADE

02:18:46.418 --> 02:18:49.121 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M HEARING

02:18:47.619 --> 02:18:49.855 region:rollup2
WHEN I HEAR A LOT OF THIS.

02:18:49.121 --> 02:18:51.190 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HIGH LEVEL TO THE

02:18:49.855 --> 02:18:51.924 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY NEEDS AND THAT'S WHAT

02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:53.559 region:rollup2
THESE KIDS NEED TO GO WITH

02:18:51.924 --> 02:18:54.193 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA PICK THEIR LAN WE

02:18:53.559 --> 02:18:56.161 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE PICKING THEIR LINE

02:18:54.193 --> 02:18:57.429 region:rollup2
FOR THEM. SO AGAIN THE OVERALL

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:58.730 region:rollup2
MISSION OF THIS EFFORT IS KIND A

02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:59.865 region:rollup2
GENERAL CONCERN WITH THAT TODAY

02:18:58.730 --> 02:19:00.065 region:rollup2
TO.

02:18:59.865 --> 02:19:02.067 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:19:00.065 --> 02:19:03.335 region:rollup2
AGAIN I I REALLY THINK THE

02:19:02.067 --> 02:19:04.803 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA YOU KNOW THE MONEY ON

02:19:03.335 --> 02:19:06.238 region:rollup2
THE CONSORTIUM'S WERE WHILE I

02:19:04.803 --> 02:19:06.672 region:rollup2
HAVE ONLY NEEDS TO BE MORE.

02:19:06.238 --> 02:19:07.940 region:rollup2
AND.

02:19:06.672 --> 02:19:09.441 region:rollup2
THE CONSORTIUM MODEL REALLY

02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:11.844 region:rollup2
SCARES ME AS TO WHAT ULTIMATELY

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:13.545 region:rollup2
PLAYS OUT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:19:11.844 --> 02:19:14.146 region:rollup2
WITH THAT I TURNED ABOUT I DON'T

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:17.916 region:rollup2
KNOW IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON

02:19:14.146 --> 02:19:18.750 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:19:17.916 --> 02:19:20.252 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY LIKE TO COMMENT.

02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:21.587 region:rollup2
.

02:19:20.252 --> 02:19:22.921 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK THE WAY THE

02:19:21.587 --> 02:19:24.523 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA ARE STRUCTURED AND

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:26.124 region:rollup2
UNSTRUCTURED NOW I'VE BEEN TO A

02:19:24.523 --> 02:19:27.726 region:rollup2
MEETING OF THE A REGIONAL

02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:29.228 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

02:19:27.726 --> 02:19:31.263 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS AMAZING THEY WERE

02:19:29.228 --> 02:19:33.065 region:rollup2
THEY WERE HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS

02:19:31.263 --> 02:19:34.566 region:rollup2
THERE THE RECOUP SEVERAL

02:19:33.065 --> 02:19:35.934 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:19:34.566 --> 02:19:38.136 region:rollup2
THERE WERE INDUSTRY EXPERTS THEY

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:39.671 region:rollup2
HAD A PILOT TRAINING PROGRAM.

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:42.407 region:rollup2
AND YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE THE

02:19:39.671 --> 02:19:43.008 region:rollup2
HIGH SCHOOL FOLKS TALKING

02:19:42.407 --> 02:19:43.609 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:19:43.008 --> 02:19:45.510 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:19:43.609 --> 02:19:46.612 region:rollup2
WHAT COURSES COULD THEY OFFER TO

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:48.213 region:rollup2
THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT

02:19:46.612 --> 02:19:50.249 region:rollup2
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN PURSUING

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:51.917 region:rollup2
THIS CAREER? AND A WHINING THESE

02:19:50.249 --> 02:19:53.886 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THERE WAS AN INCREDIBLE

02:19:51.917 --> 02:19:56.388 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF COORDINATION AND

02:19:53.886 --> 02:19:58.757 region:rollup2
ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS PROGRAM SO I

02:19:56.388 --> 02:20:00.325 region:rollup2
THINK THE THE REGIONAL CONSORTIA

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:01.860 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY SHOWN PROVEN

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:03.528 region:rollup2
SUCCESSES THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:04.897 region:rollup2
OUTCOME DATA. THAT'S ALREADY

02:20:03.528 --> 02:20:06.498 region:rollup2
BEEN COLLECTED THAT'S AVAILABLE

02:20:04.897 --> 02:20:08.533 region:rollup2
IN THE LUNCH BOARD WE HAVEN'T

02:20:06.498 --> 02:20:10.202 region:rollup2
REALLY SEEN OUTCOME DATA FROM

02:20:08.533 --> 02:20:11.403 region:rollup2
THE INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM SO I

02:20:10.202 --> 02:20:12.738 region:rollup2
THINK WE'VE KIND OF GOT PROVEN

02:20:11.403 --> 02:20:15.040 region:rollup2
RESULTS THAT THE

02:20:12.738 --> 02:20:16.308 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS WORKING. WE'VE ALSO

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:17.776 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'VE ALREADY

02:20:16.308 --> 02:20:19.845 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED A LOT OF KEY THROUGH

02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:21.179 region:rollup2
TWELVE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:20:19.845 --> 02:20:22.748 region:rollup2
ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE STRONG

02:20:21.179 --> 02:20:24.283 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE CONSORTIA AND WE JUST

02:20:22.748 --> 02:20:25.450 region:rollup2
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO EXPAND

02:20:24.283 --> 02:20:27.152 region:rollup2
UPON IT WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:29.488 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. INTO THE COMMUNITY

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:31.223 region:rollup2
COLLEGES THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO

02:20:29.488 --> 02:20:33.091 region:rollup2
WOULD RECEIVE THE CAPE FOR

02:20:31.223 --> 02:20:34.960 region:rollup2
TWELVE MONEY WOULD BE SWAYED BY

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:36.662 region:rollup2
A SEPARATE COMMITTEE. IN THE

02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:38.297 region:rollup2
CONSORTIUM THAT'S MADE UP OF K.

02:20:36.662 --> 02:20:40.032 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWELVE.

02:20:38.297 --> 02:20:41.800 region:rollup2
EXPERTS IN AND PROVIDERS THAT

02:20:40.032 --> 02:20:43.635 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SELECTED BY CAPABLE OF

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:45.337 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDERS I'M.

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:46.271 region:rollup2
I AGAIN I I DON'T KNOW WHY IT

02:20:45.337 --> 02:20:48.006 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TAKEN OF THAT PART OF

02:20:46.271 --> 02:20:49.107 region:rollup2
EDUCATION'S HANDS I'VE HEARD

02:20:48.006 --> 02:20:50.208 region:rollup2
THIS CONCERNS WITH THE WAY

02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:51.543 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HANDLED THE PAST BUT NO

02:20:50.208 --> 02:20:53.378 region:rollup2
ONE HAS BROUGHT THOSE CONCERNS

02:20:51.543 --> 02:20:54.579 region:rollup2
TO THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST.

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.882 region:rollup2
SO THEY HAVE CONCERNS THAT SHE

02:20:54.579 --> 02:20:58.650 region:rollup2
SAID NOW HE REALLY LAID OUT SO

02:20:56.882 --> 02:21:00.719 region:rollup2
WE KNOW WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE.

02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:02.020 region:rollup2
CD NEEDS MORE SUPPORT DOLLAR

02:21:00.719 --> 02:21:03.822 region:rollup2
WISE OR WHATEVER TO HELP THESE

02:21:02.020 --> 02:21:04.423 region:rollup2
TO HANDLE THESE FUNCTIONS SO

02:21:03.822 --> 02:21:05.657 region:rollup2
MUCH IT SAY THEY SHOULD SAY IN

02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:06.291 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:07.459 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE JUST YOU KNOW KIND

02:21:06.291 --> 02:21:09.328 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW.

02:21:07.459 --> 02:21:10.829 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE OPEN SECRET IF YOU

02:21:09.328 --> 02:21:12.197 region:rollup2
WILL AND ON THAT POINT I WOULD

02:21:10.829 --> 02:21:13.465 region:rollup2
JUST SAY BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD

02:21:12.197 --> 02:21:15.133 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERN AS WELL BUT

02:21:13.465 --> 02:21:16.868 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS NOT STRUCTURED THIS

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:18.470 region:rollup2
WAY. AS A SLIGHT TO THE

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:19.538 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OR OUT OF CONCERNS

02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:21.373 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THEY'VE ADMINISTERED

02:21:19.538 --> 02:21:23.108 region:rollup2
THE CTD PROGRAM IT'S REALLY

02:21:21.373 --> 02:21:24.776 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED THIS WAY BECAUSE THE

02:21:23.108 --> 02:21:26.278 region:rollup2
GOAL IS TO GET THESE DOLLARS.

02:21:24.776 --> 02:21:27.346 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THE LOCAL REGIONAL

02:21:26.278 --> 02:21:28.914 region:rollup2
CONSORTIA IT'S WHERE LOCAL

02:21:27.346 --> 02:21:30.515 region:rollup2
DECISION MAKING CAN INFORM BUT

02:21:28.914 --> 02:21:32.117 region:rollup2
CTE CLASSES THAT ARE BEING

02:21:30.515 --> 02:21:34.019 region:rollup2
OFFERED IN THE REGION WE THINK

02:21:32.117 --> 02:21:35.987 region:rollup2
IT'S. IT'S BETTER STRUCTURED

02:21:34.019 --> 02:21:36.521 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR PROPOSAL RATHER THAN

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:37.989 region:rollup2
HAVING THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:41.059 region:rollup2
EDUCATION AT THE STATE LEVEL

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:41.660 region:rollup2
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT PROGRAMS

02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:42.294 region:rollup2
THAT ARE. YOU KNOW REGIONALLY

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:43.695 region:rollup2
LINE.

02:21:42.294 --> 02:21:45.130 region:rollup2
OKAY I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:21:43.695 --> 02:21:46.498 region:rollup2
HOW HOW THAT WORKS BETTER I'D

02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:49.034 region:rollup2
STILL HASN'T MEDICS ARTICULATED

02:21:46.498 --> 02:21:50.235 region:rollup2
A MAN Y. THAT'S A BETTER IDEA.

02:21:49.034 --> 02:21:52.704 region:rollup2
AND WHY THAT'S NOT EVEN A

02:21:50.235 --> 02:21:53.905 region:rollup2
PRECEDENT SETTING IDEA WHAT ELSE

02:21:52.704 --> 02:21:55.140 region:rollup2
ARE WE GONNA HAND OVER TO THE

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:56.475 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM TO RUN

02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:57.943 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OUR OWN.

02:21:56.475 --> 02:21:58.910 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN THE

02:21:57.943 --> 02:21:59.911 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE NOT DOING RIGHT I

02:21:58.910 --> 02:22:00.512 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE NOT

02:21:59.911 --> 02:22:01.747 region:rollup2
DOING RIGHT SO I CAN HELP FIX

02:22:00.512 --> 02:22:02.848 region:rollup2
IT.

02:22:01.747 --> 02:22:04.616 region:rollup2
I MIGHT LIKE TO KEEP YOU KNOW

02:22:02.848 --> 02:22:06.752 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IN HOUSE.

02:22:04.616 --> 02:22:09.521 region:rollup2
I JUST LIKE KEEP IT THERE PAGES

02:22:06.752 --> 02:22:10.956 region:rollup2
JUST SEEMS TO BE MORE REFINED.

02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:12.991 region:rollup2
AND THE MORE PURPOSEFUL.

02:22:10.956 --> 02:22:18.263 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

02:22:12.991 --> 02:22:20.999 region:rollup2
ALTERNATE YOU MISTER THANK YOU.

02:22:18.263 --> 02:22:25.303 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION FROM THE.

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:27.005 region:rollup2
OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. WE.

02:22:25.303 --> 02:22:29.274 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY I HAVE A PROBLEM

02:22:27.005 --> 02:22:31.777 region:rollup2
WITH REGIONAL ALIGNMENT.

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:33.011 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK IN

02:22:31.777 --> 02:22:33.545 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU ACTUALLY READ WERE

02:22:33.011 --> 02:22:34.546 region:rollup2
HAVING THEIR ON EMPLOYMENT

02:22:33.545 --> 02:22:35.881 region:rollup2
RATES.

02:22:34.546 --> 02:22:37.816 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONAL PROJECTION OF JOB

02:22:35.881 --> 02:22:39.284 region:rollup2
OPENINGS.

02:22:37.816 --> 02:22:40.919 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CHICHI

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:42.454 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>IN A IN A GROUP AND THE</c></u>

02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:45.424 region:rollup2
MORE COMMON SEEN WAY?

02:22:42.454 --> 02:22:47.225 region:rollup2
IN THE SENSE THAT.

02:22:45.424 --> 02:22:48.593 region:rollup2
YOUNG WE'RE EXPOSING YOUNG

02:22:47.225 --> 02:22:50.128 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ESPECIALLY KIDS OF COLOR

02:22:48.593 --> 02:22:52.030 region:rollup2
AND WOMEN.

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:53.765 region:rollup2
TO MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE IN

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:55.667 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT AREAS EARLIER ON

02:22:53.765 --> 02:22:57.068 region:rollup2
INDICATE TWELVE EDUCATION.

02:22:55.667 --> 02:22:58.837 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY MAY

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.571 region:rollup2
NOT DECIDE TO GO INTO THE PRESS

02:22:58.837 --> 02:23:01.206 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH TALKED ABOUT

02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:03.442 region:rollup2
EARLIER. THAT WE PUT FIFTY FIVE

02:23:01.206 --> 02:23:04.376 region:rollup2
MILLION. MAY MEAN THAT THEY

02:23:03.442 --> 02:23:06.445 region:rollup2
DECIDE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO

02:23:04.376 --> 02:23:07.779 region:rollup2
CAL TECH CAN BE AN ENGINEER

02:23:06.445 --> 02:23:10.782 region:rollup2
SOMETHIN SO.

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:13.518 region:rollup2
DID THE CT EXPOSURE. IS MUCH

02:23:10.782 --> 02:23:19.291 region:rollup2
MORE. IN EDUCATION.

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:22.060 region:rollup2
THEN A NONVIOLENT RATIO THE.

02:23:19.291 --> 02:23:25.664 region:rollup2
.

02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:27.466 region:rollup2
WE. ANOTHER REASON I LIKE IT IS

02:23:25.664 --> 02:23:29.367 region:rollup2
IN THERE. AND THE.

02:23:27.466 --> 02:23:32.103 region:rollup2
DECEMBER JANET IS BECAUSE.

02:23:29.367 --> 02:23:33.338 region:rollup2
WE'VE. OUTLINED IN LOCAL CONTROL

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:34.606 region:rollup2
FUNDING. WITH A LOCAL CONTROL

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:35.974 region:rollup2
PLAN.

02:23:34.606 --> 02:23:38.443 region:rollup2
AND NOW WE HAVE A DASHBOARD TO

02:23:35.974 --> 02:23:40.412 region:rollup2
SEE HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.

02:23:38.443 --> 02:23:42.414 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE SAID A NUMBER YEARS UP

02:23:40.412 --> 02:23:44.749 region:rollup2
HERE THAT WE WANT TO DASHBOARD.

02:23:42.414 --> 02:23:45.650 region:rollup2
TO INCLUDE CORRECT ACKNOWLEDGE

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:46.751 region:rollup2
CATION AS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

02:23:45.650 --> 02:23:48.987 region:rollup2
MEASURE.

02:23:46.751 --> 02:23:51.523 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:23:48.987 --> 02:23:53.191 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE GOING TO HOLD.

02:23:51.523 --> 02:23:54.659 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOLS KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM

02:23:53.191 --> 02:23:56.361 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE.

02:23:54.659 --> 02:23:58.330 region:rollup2
FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

02:23:56.361 --> 02:24:00.198 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THEIR EL CAP AND

02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:00.999 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DASHBOARD.

02:24:00.198 --> 02:24:04.269 region:rollup2
WHY WOULD THEY DO NOT CONTROL

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:05.904 region:rollup2
THE MONEY?

02:24:04.269 --> 02:24:06.238 region:rollup2
SO TO ME IT JUST MAKES SENSE

02:24:05.904 --> 02:24:08.106 region:rollup2
THAT'S THERE.

02:24:06.238 --> 02:24:10.208 region:rollup2
.

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:11.209 region:rollup2
AND PROBABLY THE CENTRAL ISSUE

02:24:10.208 --> 02:24:12.244 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE CENTRAL ISSUE BUT AN

02:24:11.209 --> 02:24:13.378 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ISSUE.

02:24:12.244 --> 02:24:15.280 region:rollup2
IS THAT

02:24:13.378 --> 02:24:17.415 region:rollup2
.

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:17.983 region:rollup2
THE ORIGINAL PLAN THAT I LOOKED

02:24:17.415 --> 02:24:19.451 region:rollup2
AT IT JUST DOING THE NUMBER

02:24:17.983 --> 02:24:20.886 region:rollup2
FIGURES.

02:24:19.451 --> 02:24:22.320 region:rollup2
ON A ONE TO ONE RATIO WITH

02:24:20.886 --> 02:24:23.522 region:rollup2
OPPOSE GOVERNOR'S MANAGER OVER

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.558 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

02:24:23.522 --> 02:24:28.193 region:rollup2
AB ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

02:24:26.558 --> 02:24:29.828 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE PUTTING IN CT.

02:24:28.193 --> 02:24:31.530 region:rollup2
WAS A ONE TO ONE MATCH.

02:24:29.828 --> 02:24:32.564 region:rollup2
IF THEY GO TO TO TO ONE MATCH

02:24:31.530 --> 02:24:33.665 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S POINT NINE BILL

02:24:32.564 --> 02:24:38.203 region:rollup2
IT'S ONLYNINE HUNDRED MILLION

02:24:33.665 --> 02:24:39.137 region:rollup2
OVER THREE YEARS.

02:31:09.694 --> 02:31:11.729 region:rollup2
THE CLAIMS VARY QUITE

02:31:10.962 --> 02:31:14.632 region:rollup2

THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT.

02:31:20.204 --> 02:31:23.041 region:rollup2
AND IT'S EVEN MORE DRAMATIC WITH

02:31:21.606 --> 02:31:23.575 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHERE WE

02:31:23.041 --> 02:31:24.876 region:rollup2

THAT ALL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED

02:31:39.624 --> 02:31:42.427 region:rollup2

I AM WHEN IT COMES TO THE MANY

BACKLOG PAYMENTS WE FIND THAT

02:31:55.640 --> 02:31:58.242 region:rollup2
THE APPROACH IS HIGHLY

02:31:56.741 --> 02:32:00.044 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE AND ELIMINATING THE

02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:11.823 region:rollup2
FURTHERMORE IF THE STATE WERE TO

02:32:10.388 --> 02:32:13.658 region:rollup2
CONTINUE THIS APPROACH IT WOULD

02:32:11.823 --> 02:32:16.194 region:rollup2
COST TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

02:32:13.658 --> 02:32:17.629 region:rollup2
TO FULLY RETIRE. V. I'M ROUGHLY

02:32:45.657 --> 02:32:48.960 region:rollup2
SUCH A PLAN COULD HAVE THE STATE

FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. AND.

02:46:30.681 --> 02:46:34.051 region:rollup2
TEACH ESL ONE BE.

02:46:32.316 --> 02:46:36.487 region:rollup2
TWO ADULTS IT OUT AND HIS

02:46:34.051 --> 02:46:37.054 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE ADULT SCHOOL I WANT

02:46:36.487 --> 02:46:37.454 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

02:46:37.054 --> 02:46:39.156 region:rollup2
THE.

02:46:37.454 --> 02:46:41.558 region:rollup2
ADULT EDUCATION CREDENTIAL AND

02:46:39.156 --> 02:46:42.993 region:rollup2
SOME REASONS WHY THIS TO MY NEXT

02:46:41.558 --> 02:46:44.495 region:rollup2
DAY UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES WILL

02:46:42.993 --> 02:46:46.230 region:rollup2
COME OF THAT.

02:46:44.495 --> 02:46:48.732 region:rollup2
I THINK MOST ADULT ED TEACHERS.

02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:50.334 region:rollup2
ARE IN TEACHERS UNIONS WERE

02:46:48.732 --> 02:46:52.236 region:rollup2
EVERY TEACHER IS CREDENTIALED.

02:46:50.334 --> 02:46:53.403 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'LL HAVE LONG TERM

02:46:52.236 --> 02:46:55.239 region:rollup2
AFFECTS WITH THE ONLY TEACHERS

02:46:53.403 --> 02:46:56.773 region:rollup2
NOT BUT EVEN WORSE.

02:46:55.239 --> 02:46:58.675 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION CODE DOESN'T SAY

02:46:56.773 --> 02:47:01.445 region:rollup2
ADULT EDUCATION TEACHER SAYS

02:46:58.675 --> 02:47:03.547 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATED PERSONNEL.

02:47:01.445 --> 02:47:05.382 region:rollup2
I THING MY MY DISTRICT LAUSD

02:47:03.547 --> 02:47:07.951 region:rollup2
WOULD BE VERY AGGRESSIVE.

02:47:05.382 --> 02:47:09.286 region:rollup2
TOWARDS TEACHERS IF WE CHANGE

02:47:07.951 --> 02:47:10.787 region:rollup2
THAT NOT CERTIFICATE HAVING A

02:47:09.286 --> 02:47:12.222 region:rollup2
BETTER SOLUTION.

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:13.724 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SIMPLY TO MAKE THE

02:47:12.222 --> 02:47:15.158 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS OF THE ADULT ED

02:47:13.724 --> 02:47:15.592 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL.

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:17.828 region:rollup2
SAME AS THE MINIMUM

02:47:15.592 --> 02:47:20.030 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

02:47:17.828 --> 02:47:21.164 region:rollup2
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:22.633 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD MEAN EVERY ADULT THE

02:47:21.164 --> 02:47:23.700 region:rollup2
TEACHER COULD TEACHING COMMUNITY

02:47:22.633 --> 02:47:25.202 region:rollup2
COLLEGE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:26.770 region:rollup2
TEACHERS.

02:47:25.202 --> 02:47:27.571 region:rollup2
COULD SIMPLY ASK FOR THEIR

02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:28.872 region:rollup2
CREDENTIAL BECAUSE THEY'VE

02:47:27.571 --> 02:47:30.741 region:rollup2

02:47:28.872 --> 02:47:32.009 region:rollup2
MEET THE REQUIREMENTS

02:47:30.741 --> 02:47:33.844 region:rollup2

02:47:32.009 --> 02:47:34.745 region:rollup2
BLOCK GRANT IS GREAT IT DOESN'T

02:47:33.844 --> 02:47:37.214 region:rollup2
