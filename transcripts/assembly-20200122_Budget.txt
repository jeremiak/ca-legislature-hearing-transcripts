THE FIRST ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING TO ORDER- AGAIN WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT THIS YEAR CONTINUES A STRING OF GOOD FISCAL YEARS. EVEN SYRIA AGREES SO IT'S GOOD- WE HAVE AT THIS POINT EIGHTY- TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL RESEARCH OUR BUDGET IS STRUCTURALLY BALANCE. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING SOME OF THE VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT WERE MENTIONED- DURING LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DELIBERATION BUT OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T QUITE MAKE IT IN- IN PARTICULAR JUST HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE- THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE TO- SENIORS OVER SIXTY FIVE WHO HAPPEN TO BE A DOCUMENT TO. WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH LOOKING THE DISCUSSION AROUND THE REFORMS AROUND THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION- IT ALSO- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE- PROPOSAL AND DISCUSSION AROUND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS- OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE SOME- AS WITH ANY BUDGET DISCUSSION THEY WERE STILL PROPOSALS THAT. WERE NOT INCORPORATED THAT WE OBVIOUSLY WILL BE. RINGING FIVE BRING FORWARD TODAY TALKING ABOUT TODAY AND THAT'S- THE EXPANSION OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR. ADULTS WHO USE I TENS WHEN THEY FILE. ALSO THERE WAS- CONCERNING CUT TO THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM- THAT IS- DEPARTURE FROM. THE LAST TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF FUNDING THEY ALSO- WITHIN SEE QUITE THE INVESTMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT WE HAVE HOPE TO SEE- WE ALSO. OUR CONCERN THAT MANY OF THE- PROPOSALS REFERENCE A SPRING. REGULAR BILL- SOME SOME SORT OF ALL WAITING TILL WE ACTUALLY FINISH OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE DELIBERATIONS TO- UNVEILED PROPOSALS AND DETAILS- WHILE LAST YEAR WAS OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S FIRST YEAR WE UNDERSTAND- SOME PROPOSALS NEEDING TO TAKE MORE TIME TO. FULLY BE FLUSHED OUT IN TO BE DISCUSSED GIVEN THAT THIS IS YOUR TO WE REALLY WOULD HELP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE- TRAILER BILLS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN BE DELIBERATE ON OBVIOUSLY IN BOTH CHAMBERS. HAVE THE PUBLIC BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THEM- IT ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE- DISCUSSION OF OUR EIGHTY LEGISLATIVE MEMBERS AND GET THEIR FEEDBACK BEFORE. THEY GET VOTED ON OBVIOUSLY THIS CAN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THERE ARE ALWAYS EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES BUT AGAIN- WE BELIEVE THAT WE HOLD OVER A HUNDRED HEARINGS FOR A REASON- IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DELIBERATE EVERY ASPECT OF THE BUDGET- IN OUR FIVE DIFFERENT SUBCOMMITTEES WE HAVE HOURS AND HOURS OF FRAUD ROBUST. PUBLIC TESTIMONY ON ALL THOSE ISSUES. AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD JOIN THIS AND THAT- VIEWPOINT AROUND TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF JUST- THE HEARING- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MISTER TWENTIETH AND- SPEAK- FOLLOWED BY OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MISTER PADDOCK- AND THEY WERE GOING TO GO TO MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS BEFORE WE START I WAS GOING TO SEE IF OUR VICE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO. MAKE IT A OPEN REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO JOIN THE CHAIR IN WELCOMING EVERYONE TO ANOTHER YEAR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. I REMAIN CONVINCED THAT OF ALL THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE THINGS THAT WE DO ON WORKING ON THE BUDGET OR THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED US. IN FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WORK THAT TO ALL OF YOU DO SO I WANT TO THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HARD WORK IN YOUR DILIGENCE THIS YEAR I'M VERY EXCITED. TO WORK WITH YOU IN CRAFTING THE BUDGET. THEY WITHOUT MISTER THIS ONE AT THE- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MR VICE CHAIR I WILL PROVIDE A BIG THIS OR NOT OF ANY PART OF FINANCE WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET BUT WE'LL KEEP IT TO LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES JUST FOCUSED ON THE OVERALL STRUCTURE SO TO RETAIN pQUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THE BUDGET IS TO HER TWENTY TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER ALL OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IS GENERAL FUND IT'S A BALANCED BUDGET- THAT IS NOT SIMPLY BALANCE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR BUT ALSO HAS OPERATING SURPLUSES IN THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THAT MEETING IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ARE PROJECTING THAT WE WILL RECEIVE MORE IN REVENUE TRANSFERS IN THAT YEAR AND THE EXPENDITURES THAT WE'RE PROJECTING FOR THAT YEAR AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR A LONGER TERM BUDGET RESILIENCY FOR THE STATE. IN ADDITION AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED THIS BUDGET BILL SIGNIFICANT RESERVES AND WE'RE PROJECTING THAT AT THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR WE WILL HAVE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES IN BETWEEN THE RAINY DAY FUND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THE SAFETY NET RESERVE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT AGAINST CUTS FOR MEDI CAL AND CAL WORKS. IN ADDITION A YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE HAD SIGNIFICANT PENSION PAY DOWN SOME LAST YEAR'S ENACTED BUDGET- IN THAT BUDGET PLAN WE HAVE PROJECTED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL COMPLEMENT CALPERS PAYMENTS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS DESPITE ACCELERATES ALL THOSE PAYMENTS OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE BODY. INTO THE CURRENT YEAR. I ALSO RECALL. THAT DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. OVER THE SUSPEND PROGRAM IN THE BUDGET ACT THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR. THIS BUDGET- PROPOSAL FROM THE GOVERNOR DOES CONTINUE THOSE SUSPENDED PROGRAMS TO KEEP THE BUDGET IN BALANCE BUT DELAYS THOSE SUSPENSIONS. BY EIGHTEEN MONTHS SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T TAKE A FACT. UNDER OUR PROJECTIONS IN TOLD THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- FINALLY WHEN IT COMES THE SURPLUS WE DON'T. WE ARE NOT PROJECT IN THE TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR BUT WE ARE PROJECTING A SURPLUS FOR THIS BUDGET. OF ABOUT FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS. AS WITH LAST YEAR WE DEVOTE THE LAST. THE VAST MAJORITY ALMOST PROGRAMS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THEN BEYOND THAT THERE ARE NUMBER OF NEW INITIATIVES. PARTICULARLY IN HOMELESSNESS. WILDFIRES IN EDUCATION- BIG NEW PROPOSALS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE AS WELL AS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AND HAPPY TO GO INTO ANY OF THOSE- AND QUESTIONS. AND THEN I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THE CHAIRS POINT ABOUT- GETTING THESE PROPOSALS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE- I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE- ARE WORKING AS- MUCH AS THEY CAN TO GET AS MANY THINGS READY FOR FABRIC FIRST. POSSIBLE THERE WILL BE SUPPOSED DOES. PARTICULARLY IN SOME BRAND NEW NATION S. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE HEALTHCARE DRUG PRICING SPACE. WE'LL TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL TIME BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING. WE UNDERSTAND THE DIRECTOR THAT. THE EARLIER PIECE OF. CAN BE REVIEW THE BETTER CAN BE CONSIDERED BY THE LAST. THANK. THANK YOU. GREAT YOU MISS CHAIR ARM VICE CHAIR AND THEN FOR HAVE ME HERE TODAY I WAS TO PROVIDE SOME CALM COULD AND THREE MAY AREAS ONE OUR OFFICES VIEW OF THE BUDGET STRUCTURE INCLUDING THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- A WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE SOME WHAT WE VIEW AS SOME OF THE KEY CHOICES IN THE BUDGET PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE STATE'S TO ESTIMATED DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES AND THEN I WOULD. CONCLUDE WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- OF OUR VIEW ON THE IMPLICATION OF THE OVERALL PACKAGE- FORWARD BEFORE YOU- ON THE STATE'S BUDGET CONDITION AND MULTI YEAR FISCAL OUTLOOK SO WITH THAT WE'LL BEGIN WITH ON PAGE ONE I HOPE I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE THIS- HAND OUT THIS IS- ANY BEGIN WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- PROPOSAL A TALK ABOUT IT SEPARATELY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. HUNDRED THE UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT ESTABLISHES THE MINIMUM FUNDING LEVEL FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO YOU CAN REALLY THINK OF IT AS KIND OF A SORT OF A BUDGET Â¢HIN THE BUDGET AND- FOR THE COMING YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES EIGHTY FOUR BILLION IN TOTAL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING THIS IS AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION FROM THE CURRENT YEAR. NOW THE GOVERNOR POSES ONE POINT HAVE THAT GO TO ONGOING PURPOSES PRIMARILY DEFINED ACOSTA LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND LOCAL CAN. FOR ME. BUT HE WAS. ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS- NOW WE THINK THIS SPLIT IS PRUDENT BECAUSE IN THE EVENT THAT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE WERE TO DROP. IT MEANS THAT THIS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET COULD ACCOMMODATE THE ONGOING- PROGRAMS- WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE CUTS DESPITE THAT DESPITE THAT POTENTIAL DROP. ANOTHER COUPLE OF POINTS I WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPOSAL ONE IS THAT MANY OF THE ONE TIME PROPOSALS DO APPEAR TO ALIGN WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PREVIOUSLY INDICATED- PRIORITIES. HOWEVER MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE LONG STANDING ONES AND SO ONE QUESTION WE HAVE IS WHETHER ONE TIME FUNDING IS REALLY THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE OR IF ACTUALLY THEY WOULD NEED ONGOING FUNDING. TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONGER TERM. THE OTHER. COMMENT THAT WE HAVE IS IN IT IN SO FAR AS THE LEGISLATURE WANTED TO HAVE THEM THE GREATEST FISCAL IMPACT FOR THE FOR THE DISTRICTS IT COULD CONSIDER REPURPOSE SEEN SOME OF THE ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS TO- HELPING THE DISTRICTS PAY DOWN THE LONG TERM LIABILITIES THAT THEY FACE WITH RETIREE BENEFITS. IT'S SO TO THE SECOND PAGE. WHERE YOU HAVE HERE IS A- IS- SLIDE AND NOW WE'RE REALLY MOVING AWAY FROM PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO THIS IS SORT OF EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE BUDGET APART FROM THE NINETY EIGHT PORTION. YOU'LL NOTE ON THIS SLIDE ABOVE THE PIE CHART THERE'S A REFERENCE TO A SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS THIS IS. OUR ESTIMATE OF THE SURPLUS BASED ON THE GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR'S A BUDGET DOCUMENTS. AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THE SURPLUS THAT WE ESTIMATE FROM OUR OFFICE VERY SIMILAR AND THE REASON IT'S SO SIMILAR IS THAT WE HAVE VERY CLOSE REVENUE ESTIMATES FOR THE WINDOW OF YEARS TO COVER THE BUDGET YEARS SO. 271-919-2020 TWENTY ONE PERFECT DEPARTMENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S OF REVENUES IN THE BIG THREE REVENUE SOURCES ARE ONLY THIRTY FOUR MILLION ABOVE OURS SO ON IT IT'S A- NOTABLY CLOSE- FIGURE. IF WE LOOK AT THE PIE CHART I CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF NUMBERS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL- IN THE ONGOING SPENDING CATEGORY THERE'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. THE GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOCATE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TO TEMPORARY OR ONE TIME SPENDING- PROPOSALS AND THEN HE HOLDS ONE POINT SIX BILLION ASIDE. TO MAINTAIN THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVE THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND THEN THERE'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE OTHER CATEGORY. ONE THING YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED IN THE BUDGET IS THAT THERE ARE A HIGH NUMBER OF RELATIVELY SMALLER- PROPOSALS. AND YOU KNOW IN FACT WE LOOKED AT IT AND THERE IS WEEK WE ESTIMATE THAT. 95% OF THE PROPOSALS ARE FOR A HUNDRED MILLION OR LESS WHICH IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BUDGET THEY'RE RELATIVELY SMALL. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE THREE. THIS FIGURE DISPLAYS HOW THE GOVERNOR ALLOCATE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION IN DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES ACROSS PROGRAM AREAS THE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION JUST TO CONNECT THE DOTS HERE THE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION IS THE SON OF THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AN- ONGOING SPENDING PLUS THE- TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION AND ONE TIME. SPENDING PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT WORK THAT I MENTIONED ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE. AT A HIGH LEVEL THE ONE TIME SPENDING IS CONCENTRATED AND- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE AS THE GOVERNOR'S ONGOING PROPOSE SPENDING WOULD GO TOWARD HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT I SAID ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE ABOUT HOW- THERE'S A HIGH NUMBER OF STE RELATIVELY SMALLER PROGRAM PROPOSALS THIS IN OUR VIEW THIS THIS PRESENTS SOMEWHAT OF A TRADE OFF FOR THE LEGISLATURE WOULD YOU RATHER DO THAT OR WOULD YOU RATHER PURSUE A SMALLER NUMBER BUT LARGER TICKET ITEMS SO THAT'S SORT OF A CHOICE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS. ANOTHER POINT THAT WE WOULD MAKE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL IS THAT SOME OF THE- CONCEPTS- PUT FORWARD IN THE IN THE BUDGET PACKAGE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EXERT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE STATE'S COST STRUCTURE OVER THE LONG TERM IN WAYS THAT ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THESE ESTIMATES. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE WHERE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES FOR THE STATE TO- ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE SORT OF NEW NEW TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE AND- PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR CHANGING THE SCOPE OR MISSION OF SOME OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ANOTHER. BABY MERRICK TO THESE TO THESE IDEA. BUT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THIS POINT TO SAY THAT IT WOULDN'T. LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS DOWN THE ROAD FOR THE STATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. MOVING TO SLIDE FOR HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE- CONDITION OF THE BUDGET- OVER THE RECENT YEARS IN IS- AS HE IS BEEN SAID. RESERVES ARE AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS ARE A RESERVE FIGURES TWENTY POINT FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL UNDER THE- UNDER THE- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IS ONE THING THAT WE NOTE IN THIS PACKAGE IS THAT. IN A DEPARTURE FROM PRACTICE TAKING IN RECENT BUDGETS THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT PROPOSED TO. SET IT USE. THE THIS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATED SURPLUS TO BUILD UP THE STATE'S DISCRETIONARY RESERVES. THAT SAID PROPOSITION TWO CONTINUES TO DO ITS JOB AND IS LEADING TO ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS INTO THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT FIGURE GROWING OVER THE YEARS SHOWN IN THE TABLE. PAGE FIVE IS HERE- THIS SLIDE IS SHOWING YOU HOW WE DISPLAY ESTIMATES OF THE GOVERNOR'S A SPENDING PLAN ACROSS THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WHAT I WOULD DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO IS THE DARKER PORTIONS OF THOSE BARS THOSE ARE THE OPERATING SURPLUSES AND WHAT I WOULD SAY ABOUT THOSE IS THAT WHILE THEY REMAIN POSITIVE THROUGHOUT THE MULTI YEAR OUTLOOK THE OPERATING SURPLUSES ARE SMALL. AND MOREOVER THEY DEPEND ON SEVERAL KEY ASSUMPTIONS HOLDING ONE IS THAT THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW. TO THE SECOND AREA IS THAT THE FEDERAL REGULATORS APPROVED A MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX. pSUSPENSIONS THAT. THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- FOR THE CURRENT YEAR DO TAKE EFFECT THEY WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A SOMEWHAT LARGER- SIR- OPERATINGSURPLUS IN THAT YEAR I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THOUGH THAT IF THOSE SIR IF THOSE SUSPENSIONS DID NOT TAKE EFFECT IN THAT FINAL YEAR THEN THERE WOULD BE AN OPERATING DEFICIT. SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO BE COGNIZANT OF. ON THE ON THE LAST PAGE I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE A COUPLE OF FINAL OVER ARCHING THOUGHTS HERE ONE IS THAT WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO BEGIN THE PROCESS HERE OF JUST THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL OVERALL LEVEL OF RESERVES PROPOSED HERE BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT- WE SAID IN OUR NOVEMBER FISCAL OUTLOOK THAT THE- THAT WE CAN WE HAD A KIND OF A RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF NEW ONGOING SPENDING OF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THE PROPOSAL HERE GOES A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IT'S ONE POINT FOUR BILLION GROWING TO ONE BULLET POINT EIGHT BILLION OVER TIME. AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE VERY SMALL OPERATING SURPLUSES IN THE THROUGHOUT THE MULTI YEAR PERIOD. AND IN SO FAR AS THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT WANT TO BUILD LARGER DISCRETIONARY RESERVES SIT IN THE WAY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THEN- AN ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION WOULD BE TO MAINTAIN LARGER OPERATING SURPLUSES WE THINK PRESERVING- BUILDING CONTINUING TO BUILD FISCAL RESILIENCE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME. THE NO ONE CAN TELL US FOR SURE WHEN THE NEXT RECESSION WILL OCCUR BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE CURRENT EXPANSION IS QUITE MATURE WE'RE IN THE ELEVENTH YEAR OF AN ECONOMIC EXPANSION AND SO WHETHER IT'S- HIGHER RESERVES WERE. HOLDING ON IN PRESERVING A SOMEWHAT LARGER OPERATING SURPLUS THOSE WOULD BE- WAYS TO YOU KNOW UNDER UNDER SCORE- THE STATE'S FISCAL RESILIENCE AND YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT. SO YOU. THANK YOU BEFORE BEAGLE WITH QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA TAKE ROLE. TING OBERNOLTE ARAMBULA BLOOM BRO CHIU COOPER FONG FRAZIER GALLAGHER GARCIA JONES SAWYER LACKEY LOW MOAN MATHIS MCCARTY MEDINA MELENDEZ MULLIN MURATSUCHI NAZARIAN O'DONNELL PATTERSON RAMOS RADIUS. RIVAS RUBIO HERE STONE WEBER YEAR WICKS HERE WHAT. YOUR HOME IS PRESENT CHRISSY THANK YOU. THANK YOU COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. STRUGGLE TO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE D. O. F. AND ONE FOR THE LA YOU KNOW BUT- LET ME FREE MY QUESTIONS BY SAYING THAT I REMAIN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF SPENDING INCREASE THAT'S CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. IF YOU DO THE MATH AND YOU COMPARE. THIS PROPOSED BUDGET COMPARED WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED TWELVE MONTHS AGO WHICH I THINK IS. THE BEST APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON IT'S OVER 6% INCREASE AND I KNOW THAT THE FIRST PAGE OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET SAYS IT'S ONLY OVER A LITTLE BIT OVER TWO PERCENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THAT'S COMPARED WITH THE FINAL BUDGET FOR LAST YEAR NOT THE PROPOSED BUDGET SO IF YOU COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES IT'S ABOUT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION WHICH I THINK IS ALARMING- AND I ALSO AM CONCERNED WITH THE GROWTH OF STATE BUREAUCRACY IN THIS BUDGET WE WERE COUNTING. THE NUMBER OF NEW STATE BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE CREATED AS PART OF THE PROPOSAL AND WE STOPPED AT TWENTY FIVE BECAUSE OF THOSE THOSE THE ONES WE CAN IDENTIFY SO- AT. THE IN IN A QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT MR OF PANIC JUST TALKED ABOUT ABOUT OPERATING SURPLUS. THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED TO NOT PUT ANY NEW MONEY IN DISCRETIONARY RESEARCH IN THIS BUDGET SO WE'RE INCREASING THE DISCRETIONARY PORTION OF THE REST WAS BUT NO NEW DISCRETIONARY RESERVES. AND LA LA WAS POINTED OUT. THAT I'M GOING SPENDING COMMITMENT IS TO ELIMINATE OUR- SURPLUS I. WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT TO FOCUS ON. BUILDING THOSE RESERVES. NOW WE KNOW WHEN WE HAVE AN OPERATING SURPLUS AND WE HAVE. A SUCH A LARGE OF SURPLUS IN- IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THE FIRST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT- THE LA A DETENTION OF THOSE OPERATING SURPLUSES UNIFIED OVER TIME- ALTHOUGH THE NAY INCREASE IN THE LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF A SUSPENDED PROGRAMS. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT DIES IT'S PRETTY RARE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- FOR GOVERNOR TO PROPOSE ARE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT A BUDGET THAT HAS THAT KIND OF STRUCTURAL BALANCE NOT ONLY THE BUDGET YEAR BUTTONS FOR YEARS FOLLOWING BACK SO- SO THE FACT IS THAT ALTHOUGH IN SOME OF THOSE YEARS OPERATING SURPLUSES LOW. IT STILL IS A POSITIVE BALANCE AND THAT GOES BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION BALLOTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR SO WE DO SEE BALLOTS IN THOSE BACK SEVERAL YEARS I THINK THE NEXT POINT ON MAY BE IS- ALTHOUGH THIS BUDGET DOESN'T MAKE A DISCRETIONARY. ADDITIONAL RESERVE COMMITMENTS IN ALL THE WAYS THAT WE GET IN LAST YEAR'S ENACTED BUDGET TO THE SAFETY NET RESERVE- IDEA TO OTHERS. IT IS STILL PUTTING UNDER PROPOSITION TWO AS THE LA- NINETEEN TWO BILLION ADDITIONAL DOLLARS SO THE RAINY DAY FUND A SIXTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OUR CURRENT PROJECTION OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT IT'S GOING TO BE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OUR PROJECTION OVER HERE- I ALREADY MENTIONED THE ACCELERATION OF THE PENSION PAYMENTS THAT SHOULD HELP TO SAVE. SOME MONEY AND THEN I THINK THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS UNDER PROPOSITION TWO THEY'RE ALL THESE REQUIRED DEBT PAYMENTS AND SO IN THE OUT YEARS TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WE'RE PROJECTING AN ADDITIONAL ONE. ONE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S ON ALLOCATED AND OUR PROPOSAL I SENT CALPERS AS SUPPLEMENTAL SO WE UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND I THINK THE LAST POINT ON NAY- TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE GROWTH IN STATE SPENDING. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A CONSTRAINT AS WE WERE WALKING THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS IS IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PROJECTED RAP MUSIC TRANSFERS FOR EACH OF THE NEXT SUBSEQUENT FOUR YEARS AGO THE BUDGET YEAR AND THREE YEARS AFTER THAT. THE RATE OF GROWTH IN REVENUES IS A LOWER EACH YEAR THAN THE YEAR BEFORE SO IT'S LOWER IN 202-120-2220 TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND EACH YEAR FOLLOWING IT IT REDUCES AND SO. IF WE WANTED TO PROPOSE A STRUCTURALLY BALANCED BUDGET WHICH WE DAY WE. HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT IN THE EXPENDITURES. WITH THE JAPANESE ONE. SURE I THINK WORD FURY AGREEMENT ON ALMOST YOU BUT I WE'RE WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OPINION JUST IS WHETHER NOT WE SHOULD JUST COMMITTEE ABOUT TO RESERVE THAT LAW REQUIRES HICH IS WHY THE- PER. OR WERE WE SHOULD AS WE DID LAST YEAR CONTRIBUTES I'M EXTRA TO RESERVES RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT HAS MISTER PETTIT POINTED OUTWARD IN THE- THE WELL I LIVE IN FEAR OF OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHICH MAKES IT THE LONGEST IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY AT LEAST SINCE WORLD WAR TWO SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S- WHAT I'M ASKING ABOUT A NIGHT. I KNOW THIS IS THE START OF OUR SIX MONTH LONG DISCUSSION HERE I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT PERHAPS WE CAN SEE OUR WAY TO GETTING MORE OF A PLACE WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR WE'RE WE'RE SETTING ASIDE SOME DISCRETIONARY. HI AND ON THAT. FOR THE LA I REQUEST ABOUT OUR RESERVE LEVELS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD END THIS FISCAL YEAR WITH A LITTLE OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES- YOU HAVE CREATED A RECESSION SCENARIO FORECAST IS PART OF YOUR ANALYSIS. THAT SHOWS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A REVENUE SHORTFALL OF ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN A MODERATE RECESSION WITH AN ACTUAL DEFICIT OF ABOUT SIX FORTY BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE A PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND SOME OTHER THINGS SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHAT WOULD BE A PRUDENT LEVEL OF RESERVES. FOR US TO SEEK BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO POINT IN PUTTING ASIDE TOO MUCH WHAT WE WANT TO BE PRUDENT. AND PUT ASIDE ENOUGH THAT'S REQUIRED FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE STATE'S SERVICES THEIR CRITICAL IN A RECESSION WITHOUT RUNNING A BUDGET DEFICIT. SO OFTEN ARE WE THERE ARE WE HALFWAY THERE- WOULD YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE DOING MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THE- I. WOULD SAY THAT IN% OUR RECESSION SCENARIO FROM THIS- PAST FALL IN NOVEMBER THERE'S A COUPLE OF KEY ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO IT THE FIRST IS THAT WE ARE STARTING WITH SORT OF THE BASELINE BEFORE THIS CURRENT BUDGET PROCESS SO WE'RE KIND OF INCORPORATING WHAT THE FISCAL POSITION OF THE STATE WILL BE AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR ASSUMING THERE ARE NO ADDITIONS TO- THE STATE'S COMMITMENT SO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A NEW NEW ANSWER BUDGET WOULD REDUCE THE BUDGET CAPACITY TO WITHSTAND A RECESSION- AS FOR YOUR FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE IS PREPARED I MEAN IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DOWNTURN THE SIZE OF OUR RESERVES AND OUR LEVEL OF SPENDING RELATIVE TO OUR REVENUES SO DO YOU KNOW THE RESERVES CLASS ANY- REVENUES- ABOVE ARE SPENDING LEVEL THE SURPLUS OR WHAT PROVIDE US WITH FISCAL RESILIENCE. TO THE EXTENT THE RIVER GO TO. WE WOULD NEED TO EITHER MAKE PROGRAM CUTS INCREASE REVENUES OR YOU KNOW DRAW DOWN ON OUR RESERVES I DON'T KNOW THAT I CAN. PROVIDE A SATISFACTORY ANSWER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE PREPARED BECAUSE I THINK IN LARGE PART IT DEPENDS ON THE RISK TOLERANCE. OF THE DECISION MAKERS AND SO- YOU KNOW WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR OUTLOOK IN NOVEMBER WE WERE LOOKING AT SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF RESERVES AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT WANTS TO THE PROPOSAL IS ACCOUNTED FOR IT'S A SMALLER AMOUNT IT'S TWENTY BILLION. AND SO STILL HIS WE WANT TO PROVIDE US SOME VERY GOOD CAPACITY WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE RECESSION. OKAY I THIS IS THE START OF A LONG DISCUSSION AND I'M SURE WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT AGAIN- LET ME MAKE ONE POINT THOUGH THIS IS. A JUST CONTINUING SOMETHING THAT YOU AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER DAY. ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT LA- RECESSION SCENARIO INCLUDES. THE GOVERNMENT CUTTING. STATE SPENDING ON EDUCATION TO THE BARE MINIMUM REQUIRED UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT. AND THE LAST TIME THAT WE DID THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL IT CAUSED. WIDESPREAD DAMAGE TO OUR STATE WHAT EDUCATION SYSTEM. I DO NOT THINK FOR PLANNING PURPOSES THAT WE SHOULD BE ASSUMING. THAT WE WILL BE CUTTING FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. JUST BECAUSE THE LAW ALLOWS US TO. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT MOVING FORWARD WE COULD MAKE A PLAN. THAT WERE WE COULD RATHER WHETHER RECESSION WITH OUR RESERVES. I IN A WAY THAT INCLUDES FUNDING EDUCATION AT THE SAME LEVEL THAT WE HAVE BEEN FUNDING IT. RATHER THAN CUTTING THAT FINAL STATES SERVICE. IN ONE LAST QUESTION FOR THE- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- NEVER. REGARDS THE PROPOSED CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND THAT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL SO THAT'S A FOUR POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BOND FUND TO FIND A WIDE VARIETY OF THINGS MOST OF WHICH I FIND VERY SUPPORT BUT MY QUESTION IS THIS WE HAVE. A SIX BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE GO INTO DEBT. FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS IN A YEAR WHEN WE'RE ENJOYING A BUDGET SURPLUS IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTABLE AND I THINK LARGELY THEY ARE. WHY WOULD WE NOT JUST PAY THE PAY FOR THOSE THINGS PRIORITIZE THAT SPENDING AS WE PRIORITIZE SPENDING FOR EVERYTHINGELSE RATHER THAN PAYING THEM BACK. WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS AND PUTTING- FUTURE LEGISLATORS ON THE HOOK FOR PAY FOR DEBT REPAYMENT THAT. SO THREE THREE POINTS- ON THAT I THINK THE FIRST AS WELL WE DO HAVE THIS. FIVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND THAT'S A BIG NUMBER AND WE CAN EXPECT THAT WILL HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVERY YEAR. AS THE LA MENTIONED- ONE POINT SIX BILLION OF THAT IS JUST AN RSS FEED YOU AND THAT'S OUR RESERVE ACCOUNT FOR. ANY SORTS OF EMERGENCY OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT. COMES UP AND IN ADDITION TO THAT I SOME EXPENDITURES THAT WERE MAKING OUT OF THAT SURPLUS OUR EXPENDITURES THAT WE REALLY DO NEED TO MAKE AND SOME OF THEM- ARE ACTUALLY IN THIS AREA OF WILDFIRES IN ABOUT SETTING UP. PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO CAL FIRE THE WILDFIRES RIGHT INTEGRATION CENTER- SOLAT IN THAT SPACE- SO WHEN YOU ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT. WHAT'S REALLY NO IT'S ALL DISCRETIONARY BUT ONCE YOU THINK ABOUT THE EXPENDITURES THAT THE GOVERNOR FELT AT LEAST WERE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE ADMINISTRATION- THERE WASN'T FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE JUST FOR THIS ONE SET OF ITEMS. I THINK THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT- INFRASTRUCTURE I SPENDING- FOR ITEMS LIKE THIS- BONDS RGO BONDS ARE APPROPRIATE. TO YOUR POINT IT IS ALWAYS CHEAPER TO PAY IT OUT RIGHT AND TO SELL GEO BONDS BECAUSE THERE ARE. THERE IS AN. FLOOD PROTECTION DROUGHT WATER- COMMUNITY HEARTENING THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT BONDS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR BECAUSE IT IS THE CASE AS YOU MENTIONED THAT THE BURDEN. WILL BE BORNE BY IN FUTURE BUDGETS AS WELL BUT THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF THOSE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS. AND THEN THE FINAL POINT I'LL MAKE IS YOU KNOW I. CAN'T PROFESS TO PROJECT WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE GOING IN THE FUTURE YOU KNOW WE HAVE OUR BEST ESTIMATES BUT AS YOU KNOW INTEREST RATES ARE AT A LOWER LEVEL. RIGHT NOW THAN THEY HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OR DECADES SO. ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL WE THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE USE OF RESOURCES- FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE BOND. SO APPRECIATE ANSWER HOW YOU AND I DISAGREE ON THAT. I THINK THAT. WHEN WE'RE ENJOYING BUDGETARY SURPLUS IS THE TIME TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE WITH CURRENT DOLLARS. AND WHEN WE HAVE DEFICITS IS THE TIME THAT. WE MUST BORROW TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE. THE ONGOING FUNDING FOR IT AND WE IN THE NEEDS TO CONTINUES TO EXIST. FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE SO- I WOULD. MUCH PREFER US TO. NOT GO FURTHER IN DEBT IN YEARS WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS LIKE WE DO. THIS YEAR AND ALSO MAKE THE POINT THAT. I EVEN AS- YOU POINT OUT THAT INTEREST RATES ARE- THAT ALMOST A STORE CLOSE RIGHT NOW- IT'S STILL THE CASE THAT BORROWING THAT MONEY OVER TWENTY YEARS IS GOING TO REQUIRE. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INTEREST BEFORE IT'S REPAID IN FACT. I EVEN A TODAY'S INTEREST RATES I THINK IT'S OVER EIGHTY PERCENT- EXTRA THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO INPUT A DIFFERENT WAY WE COULD BUILD. ALMOST TWICE AS MUCH NFRASTRUCTURE. FOR DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND IF WE DO IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS RATHER THAN BORROWING. SO I WOULD MUCH PREFER THAT WE- THAT WE FIND THAT OUT OF. OUR ONGOING BASIS. IN YEARS WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS AS WE DO THIS YEAR. BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER- AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU BOTH- IN THE MONTHS TO COME AS WE CRAFT THIS BUDGET. THANKS THANK YOU. MISS GARCIA. AT THANK YOU WANTED- COMMENT AND QUESTIONS ON THREE DIFFERENT. AREAS IN THE BUDGET THE BOOK THE FIRST IS RELATED TO AB SIX SEVENTEEN AND OUR COMMUNITY OR PROTECTIONS- I SEE THAT THERE HAS BEEN. SLIGHT CUT IN IN THIS AREA EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ADDED FIVE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES FOR YOUR TO COMMUNITIES FIGHT THAT A FINE HOT SPOTS CREATING COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS. AND THEN IMPLEMENTING THOSE PLANS- AND SO JUST WANTED TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE RATIONALE THERE FOR THOSE CUTS. SO ALL MAKE A BRIEF POINT AND THEN MY COLLEAGUE THREE SECOND TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET A TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS CLIMATE BUDGET OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THAT INCLUDES- CAP AND TRADE AS YOU MENTIONED REVENUE FROM THAT PROGRAMS. AS WELL AS THE CLIMATE CATALYST FIND AND THEN FINALLY THAT BOND FUNDING THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE MENTIONED ARE PROJECTION FOR THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF REVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO. IS A LAST THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR WE HAD A SURPLUS OF FUNDING LAST YEAR THAT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE WILL COME. THIS YEAR SO WE HAVE TO THINK-ABOUT THE GOVERNOR HAD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE ALLOCATE A SMALLER BUCKET OF FUNDING AMONG THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SB SIX SEVENTEEN AND COMMITTEE OR PROTECTION STILL IS A BIG PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. AND ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE TO RESET TO SPEAK ABOUT. THREE OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- YES LAST YEAR COMBINED AB SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAMS TOTALED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GT R. F. THIS YEAR IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE. AND THE PRODUCTION WAS TO THE LOCAL PROGRAMS- FROM TWO HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSED THIS YEAR. AND THE LOCAL OR DISTRICT IMPLEMENTATION- ACTUALLY WENT UP BY FIVE MILLION FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE AND THEN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITY GROUPS STAY THE SAME AT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. BUT A LOT OF THE CHANGES AGAIN ATTRIBUTED TO. LAST YEAR'S CAP AND TRADE FUNDING BEING MUCH HIGHER THAN WE HAVE HERE AND FOR DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS THIS YEAR. I MEAN AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT AB SIX SEVENTEEN DOESN'T JUST NEED TO BE. SHOULDN'T JUST BE FROM THERE FROM CAP AND TRADE WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT IT ONLY THING ABOUT. THE GOVERNOR'S PLEDGE OF JUSTICE FOR ALL. ON A WHEN YOU'RE- ABOUT A HOLISTIC. APPROACH LOOKING WHAT THAT OUR RESOURCES BONDED. AND OTHER ITEMS AND THIS ONE BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE. OF INITIATIVE HE STARTED- I THINK WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN THAT IS TARGETING ANIMALS AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES THAT OFTEN FOR ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE HELP. ON AND SO WE IN WE ARE. CONTINUOUSLY THE PLAN IS ADDED TO THE COMMUNITY AND SO WE CAN BE SAYING WELL BECAUSE HE EXPECTS LESS PER- PROJECTIONS. RAINY MAKING THESE CUTS WITH A PROGRAM SUPPOSED TO BE CRYING SO I THINK. WHEN YOU LOOK BEYOND. CAP AND TRADE. HOW DO WE HONOR AND HOW DO WE HONOR THE GOVERNOR'S WILL OF JUSTICE FOR ALL AND NOT JUST. FOR SOME. OUT THERE WITH EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN AND SO. LIKE I BY SURE NATURE HAS ANYWHERE IN THE BEGINNING OF LONG NEGOTIATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT OUR COMMITMENTS. THAT WE HAVE MADE AND WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT THESE COMMUNITIES IN THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE HERE- AND I THINK WE'RE AT A CRITICAL POINT WHICH IS FINISHED THE YEAR ONE PLANTS A CERTAIN TO GET IT. SAID A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED. STARTING WITH THE YOUR PLANS. I THINK NEED TO. THIS HANDICAPPING THE MUST THE PROGRAMS. TO GO ON DEVELOP. ON. THEIR I AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING. SO WANTED TO ME THAT. I WANT TO ALSO LOOK. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC. SPECIFICALLY TOSCA AND THE TOUGH GUY COUNT THAT WE HAVE. LAST WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS ITEM HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. WE PROTECT THE TOSCA TO POTENTIALLY BE INSOLVENT IN THREE YEARS. ON AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW IN THE MONIES THAT ARE HERE RIGHT NOW LOOKING. AND THE BALANCE OF. SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVEREALLY NO SPACE FOR ANYTHING TO CHANGE AND EVERYWHERE ANY VERY ABILITY. ANA IN THERE AND SO LOOKS EVER BECOME INSOLVENT MUCH QUICKER. THAN WE HAD. ANTICIPATED AND OUR ESTIMATES CHANGE I UNDERSTAND THAT- WE'VE- DONE WE THEN HAVE A PROPOSAL OF GENERAL FUND MONIES THAT ARE MOVED. INTO ONE SPOT AND THEN SEE TO MOVE TO ANOTHER SPOT. INTO THIS IS TO BE THE SHUFFLE. OF MONEY THAT KIND OF HE'S TOO HIGH TO OUR PROBLEMS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS WE HAD LASTYEAR. AND SO THIS IS NOT A SHUFFLING OF DOLLARS AND THERE'S A RUSSIAN OFFER THIS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EXPLAIN TO US WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. WITH HIS ACCOUNT AND HOW WE'RE MOVING GENERAL FUND MONIES. IN THERE BECAUSE WHEN I JUST READ IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE SHUFFLING. WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAD A PROBLEM AND WE HAD A DAY THROUGH. A BUDGETING SEEK TO THESE NUMBERS OF REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH TASK AND HOW. THE CITY CHANGED LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR BUT EVERY DOING WITH. ACTIONS YEAH SO IT IS AN AREA WILL DEFINITELY AT MINISTRATION RECOGNIZE TO THE BUDGET. THAT'S NEAT ABSTRACT TENSION AND INTO SPECIFIC AREAS ONE. IS WITH REGARD TO THE FEE STRUCTURE AND THEN SECOND WITH REGARD TO GOVERNANCE REFORMS ARE TO RESET CAN SPEAK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE AREAS. RIGHT SO THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL IS AN GOING TO HAVE A- BIGGER- MORE DETAILED PACKAGE COME FEBRUARY FIRST ALONG WITH TRAILER BILL AND MORE DETAIL BEHIND THE PROPOSAL. YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE TOSCA FIND IT DID REQUIRE A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND BACK FILL IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH IS PROPOSED. BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO. SIT DOWN AND GO THROUGH WITH A BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF IN MORE DETAIL KIND OF. TO THE FUN CONDITION TO EXPLAINS ANY OF THE I CHANGES. BUT THERE'S NO INTENT TO SHUFFLE DOLLARS AROUND BY WE KNOW. WITH UPDATED ESTA. I AM THE FALL THAT TOSCO WAS. MEDIAN AGE FUND FILLED KIND OF KEEP. IS ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND HOW IS IT THAT WE HAVE THAT DISCREPANCY IN LAST YEAR'S ANALYSIS WITH THAT THAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD THREE YEARS. BEFORE WE GOT TO THIS POINT. BUT THEN IN THIS. CURRENT BUDGET IF YOU'RE TELLING US THAT WE GOT TO THIS POINT. RIGHT HERE REQUESTED AND SO WHAT THE DISCREPANCY THERE HOW DID WE MISS ESTIMATES ABOUT. SO THEY COULD BE I AM DIFFERENCES IN. ANTICIPATED EXPENDITURE LEVELS THAT CAME IN FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ALSO ANTICIPATED REVENUES- AND SHE'S NOT MATERIALIZING AS IS PLUS ANY INCREASED COSTS THAT WEREN'T PART OF THAT ORIGINAL ESTIMATE- I DON'T RECALL THE THREE YEAR TIME FRAME I KNOW IN OUR BUDGET SUMMARY PAGES IN THE MAYOR OF IT. LAST YEAR I BELIEVE WE REFER TO KIND OF THE BOTH OF THE FUNDS BEING BOOKED OUT MORE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH TOSCA. ART SIX REFORM EFFORTS SO AGAIN WE CAN. TRY TO GO TO THE FUND CONDITION IN MORE DETAIL WITH BUDGET SOUTH THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HELP WITH. THAT WE NEED MORE. I GUESS BUT- LAST WE HAD AT THIS WITH THE SAME DISCUSSION EARLY ON IN A CONTINUED AND I THINK IF I GO BACK TO THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL OF JUSTICE FOR ALL THIS IS ANOTHER PART OF THAT PIECE THERE OVERLOOKING AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES OVER LOOK AT TAXES WERE LOOKING AT THE SAME COMMUNITIES ARE REALLY IN ONE ISSUE AFTER ANOTHER. OUT THERE- WE WANT TO ASK A TO BE HEALTHY WE WANT IT TO WORK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE MONEY TO THE SITE WE MEDIATION OFFER BROWNFIELDS AND SUPER FUNDS AND DO OUR PART SIDE WITH THE BUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DOING WE ONE KELLY P. TO BE NEEDING IT'S YOU KNOW. IT'S GOAL AT OF HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AT THE WE FORGET THAT OFTENTIMES TIED INTO THIS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT AND IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION- IT SEEM LIKE WITH. WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THEY ANYTHING TO ME WAS THAT THEY HAD A THING TO ME LAST YEAR WITH THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED ON AND SUCH AS AS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO STABILIZE. THE TOSCOACCOUNT LONG TERM HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT MONIES ARE BEING RESPECTED WITHIN THE PROP TWENTY SIX SPECTRUM INTERNATIONALLY THINGS AROUND THAT THATALSO THAT I ASK MYSELF THE QUESTION IS THIS. TWELVE MILLION AS WE MOVE TO ONE SPOT IN THAT ELEVENTH AND THEY'RE MOVING DIRECTLY AGAIN THE WAY TO GET AROUND SOME OF THAT MISSION- THERE AND SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF DISTRUST FROM MYSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE ON HERE. ABOUT OUR COMMITMENTS I'LL. IN THIS SPACE. ON THE THIRD ITEM TAKE TO THIS AND THIS. IN THE SAME ISSUE AREA BUT THE GUY. THANKFULLY ABOUT THE T. BEFORE BRIEFLY. THAT THERE'S THE SENTENCES IN THE BUDGET WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR LANGUAGE WE'VE HAD A BILL PARKED IN THE SENATE SINCE LAST YEAR- WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT FOR FOUR YEARS- AND THE LEGISLATURE WEEK. WE AGREED TO GO AHEAD AND LET A PARK EXPECTING. SOME REAL LANGUAGE- WHEN THE RESTRICTED BUT YOU CAME OUT IT HASN'T COME OUT. AND SO WHEN I AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE THAT LINE WHICH TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE OR NOT. OXEN HERE FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND- STAKEHOLDERS ARE SHARING DETAILS. ABOUT THE T. C. REFORM THAT. ON THE HEARING ABOUT INSIDE MY FORCES ARE COMING FROM. SURE OUR TIME FRAME FOR BOTH THE FEE AND GOVERNANCE TRAILER LANGUAGES THE FEBRUARY FIRST TIME FRAMES- FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ASSOCIATE OF THE JAN TEN PROPOSAL SO THAT IS A TIME FOR MORE WORKING ON. SO I'LL KEEP. HAMMERING ON THESE THINGS ARE PER. I DISTRICT A PERSONAL TO OTHER DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT BUT- AN ISSUE OF COMMUNITIES THE COLORS OF THE COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES THAT WE SEE IN AREAS LIKE SOMEWHERE DINO. SHAFTER FRESNO. THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND SO I THINK AS THE GOVERNOR HE'S TALKING ABOUT A BUDGET. AND POLICY. AND JUSTICE FOR ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY HONOR THAT FIFTEEN THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE COMMON GROUND. WITH MYSELF IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEADERSHIP OF BEEN DOING AND THE SPACE. THANK YOU. DOCTOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW OBSERVATIONS AND- OPINIONS IF I COULD WITHOUT INHERENTLY GETTING TO DIRECT QUESTIONS AND THE FIRST ONE THAT I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE IS HOW WELL WORN THE LA OWES- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET IS WITH NOTES AND HAND WRITING. AND THEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT'S AN OPEN AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY WROTE IT BUT- WANT TO. JUST TAKE KNOWLEDGE. MANY OF US HAVE SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME DIGGING AND- JANUARY TENTH AS THE DAY I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO READ THE BUDGET IN HERE ARE GOVERNOR HELP TO PROVIDE A VISION FOR OUR STATE AND SO I DID WANT TO START WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR HIS UNDERSTANDING AND BEING A REAL HEALTHCARE GOVERNOR ONE WHO. IS ATTEMPTING TO DO SOME BROAD REFORMS- INITIALLY WAS CALLED CAL LAME IT IS CHANGED TO MEDI CAL HELD HERE FOR ALL BUT THE IDEA OF CARE COORDINATION WITH THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX SYSTEM AS WELL AS PATIENTS WHO ARE. UNABLE TO NAVIGATE THOSE SYSTEMS IS INHERENTLY IMPORTANT AND- GOOD WORK I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO DISCUSS THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT THE BENEFIT THAT COMES WITH THAT AS WELL AS THE IN LIEU OF SERVICES AS THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES HAVE LONG BEEN NECESSARY WITH AND HEALTH CARE TO HELP US TO AVOID COST DOWNSTREAM AND- THINK THAT ABILITY FOR US TO HAVE A HOLISTIC APPROACH WILL REALLY HELP US. TO REACH AFFORDABILITY WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO GIVE ME PERSONAL THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR AND DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND EVERYONE WHO HAS ADVOCATED FOR HEALTH FOR ALL ELDERS AND OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED BUILDERS IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP AND- IS APPRECIATED FROM MYSELF AS WELL AS MY DISTRICT. I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT MANY OF THE- THAT MAY BE COMING UNDER SOMEONE'S PURVIEW SUCH A- THE DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT THE CENTER FOR DATA INSIGHTS AND INNOVATION AND THE- OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY. AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION BUT ALL SAVE MANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS FOR SUB ONE OF WILL WANTS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF IT. I DID WANT TO BRING UP- ONE OF THE TWO THIRDS ISSUES WITHIN THE BUDGET WHICH MAYBE THE BEEPING. ISSUE THE USE PEIPING EPIDEMIC THAT WE HAVE. THERE'S WITHIN THE BUDGET IT DISCUSSES HELD WORK FORCE. EXPANSION IS AND- I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE US TO LOOK FOR A LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE MEDICAL LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT WE'VE DONE FOR BOTH. DOCTORS AND DENTISTS WE HAD PUT ONE TIME MONEY INITIALLY FROM PROP FIFTY SIX. BUT SINCE THIS WILL BE A CONTINUING STREAM THERE MAY BE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TIE IT TO THAT LONG. TERM LASTLY IF I COULD I. ADVOCATING FOR A LONG TIME AND REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR SPENDS TIME TO COME DOWN TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR AN ECONOMIC SUMMIT THIS YEAR. AND HELPED TO MAKE SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE WERE SUGGESTION WITHIN THE FRESNO DRIVE. WHETHER IT BE FOOD PRECISION CORRIDOR BETWEEN FRESNO STATE AND YOU SEE MERCED OR- THE SEVENTEEN MILLION FOR A K. THROUGH SIXTEEN COLLABORATIVE TO HELP US IDENTIFY EMERGING INDUSTRIES AND- WHERE THE FUTURE OF WORK WILL GO. FOR THE FIFTEEN MILLION THAT WENT INTO THE FRESNO- MEDICAL SCHOOL THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE GREATLY APPRECIATED AND HAS SHOWN HIS CONTINUED COMMITMENT. TO AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY GOTTEN THAT SUPPORT AND SO JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS- APPRECIATE- THE GOVERNOR'S CONTINUED SUPPORT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A WONDERFUL YEAR FIGURING OUT- MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I'VE SPOKEN TO TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU DOCTOR WHAT. BUT YES THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT'S INTO OF THE BUDGET- THIS APARTMENT DIRECTED PART OF FINANCE HERE THERE'S SOME PRETTY BOLD PROPOSALS- WITH REGARD TO HEALTH CARE WHICH IS REALLY EXCITING TO ME AS A AS A PROVIDER AND THE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE- BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME THERE THERE'S PRETTY WELL PRETTY LIGHT ON DETAILS- AND SO I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHEN WE WILL SEE THAT WE KEEP HEARING OF FEBRUARY FIRST DAY. BUT BUT I'VE ALSO HEARD OTHER DATES SO. AS IT RELATES TO THE BUDGET AND- WHEN WE GOING TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON SAY FOR EXAMPLE- THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE- MANUFACTURING FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS- OFFICE OF HEALTH CARE- AFFORDABILITY- WHEN WE GET SOME MORE DETAILS AT THIS POINT ON THOSE ISSUES. SO AS OU MENTIONED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS THAT ARE NEW THIS YEARIN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE AND I'D KIND IS A MIGHTY ONE WOULD LOOK AT IS TO SEPARATE THEM INTO A- COUPLE OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO I THINK THERE'S SOME WAY OR IT'S VERY CLEAR WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE AND- HOW WILL OPERATE EVEN IF IT IS A BIG TICKET ITEM AND SO AN EXAMPLE THIS IS THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE HOW. TO THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION AGE SIXTY FIVE IN ABOUT THE INCLUDING AYE HSS- PREVIOUS BUDGETS HAD DONE THAT UP TO AGE NINETEEN IN THE BUDGET ENACTED LAST YEAR TO TAKE TWENTY SIX SALT THE DIFFERENT POPULATION WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THAT WILL ROLL OUT OVER TIME AND WHAT THE DETAILS WILL BE- SO THE SECOND CATEGORY OF EXPENSES ARE SOMEWHERE WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO WORK OUT. THANKS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF THAT IN TERMS OF GENERAL CONCEPT PAPERS- AND THINKING- ALREADY JOHN AND SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE I THINK AN EXAMPLE DAY SO WE THOUGHT BROADER LEVEL IS TO HELP YOUR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AS CALENDARS DOCTOR AND GO ON AND SHE DID A DANCE IN IT. CAL AND SO THIS IS- ALL HHS AGENCIES WEBSITE- THEIR DOCUMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OR SOMETHING ABOUT IT WHAT THE APPROACH IS WHY WE THINK IT'S FRIENDS THAT WE- HAVE TO FILL IN A LOT OF THE DETAILS I THINK YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE DOCUMENTS. WHICH ARE EX. AND DISCUSS THE AGES AND SEE WHERE IT'S- THE FINAL CATEGORY WHICH I WAS THE TOUGHEST AYE AREN'T SPECIFICALLY IN THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING AND THE TO HELP FOR ONLY. SOME DETAILS ON FEB FIRST BUT FOR A LOT OF THESE MISSILES. A REAL BEEF NEW CONCEPT NO ONE ZERO SEE SOME OF THOSE PROPOSALS WILL NOT FULLY BE FLESHED OUT UNTIL THE SPRING I VERY CONSCIOUS OF YOUR POINT IN THE CHERRY POINT THAT MORE WE PUSH THIS FOR. THE TIME THE LIKE SHE HAS SEPARATE LIKE A FOR YOU THAT PEOPLE ARE WORKING AT ALL HOURS TO GET THESE READY BUT IT IS TO OUR AND THIS THAT IT'S VERY AN THAT WILL BE IN THE RACE. HOUSING AND SAYS TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IN FOR YOU DO GET RIGHT. WOULD BE HELPFUL YES. THANK YOU I MISS MATHIS. ALRIGHT SO WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BUDGET PROJECTIONS. ME ON GETTING INTO EVERYTHING AND IN REGARDS TO YOU KNOW SURPLUS IN THOSE THINGS MY BIGGST QUESTION ON MY MIND I THINK OF THE MINDS OF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. IS HAVE YOU GUYS DONE ANY PROJECTIONS ON THE CROP LOSS DUE TO THE AMPLE FOR CATIONS OF SIGMA. CIGNA IS GONNA KICK IN THIS YEAR. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A THE PROJECTIONS THAT I'VE SEEN GO UPWARDS TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH ARE THEN GOING TO CARRY OVER INTO FREE GOODS MOVEMENT. WHICH IS GOING TO CARRY OVER TO POUR CITIES JOB LOSSES THEIR- YOU KNOW I IN THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS THIS IS GONNA BE THE- WHAT TRIGGERS US INTO THIS RECESSION. THAT EVERYBODY'S BEEN SAYING IS COMING. SO I MEAN THAT'S ALL TRUE ASSEMBLY IF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BECAUSE THE DUST BOWL. AS A LOSS OF WATER DUE TO SHAKE MY DUE TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS DUE TO. THE THESE FIGHTS WITH. THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ON ON WATER RELEASES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. IF THE VALUE DOESN'T GET WATER AND ARE REAL CROPPERS DON'T PLANT WHICH IS THE CHOICES THEY'RE LOOKING AT MAKING IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. YOUR ENTIRE BUDGET COULD BE SHOT. THE EXPRESSION YOU WITH SOMETHING POSSIBLY OVER TWO BILLION DOLLAR HIT SO ARE YOU TAKING ANY FACTORS ON THAT IS THAT ON YOUR RADAR AND I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM FROM BOTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND LA L. SO ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE SERGIO'S BEEN WORKING ON ON HORSES YES. THE THIRD YOU EITHER WITH OUR FINANCE- NOT AWARE SPECIFIC NUMBERS ON CROP LOT THAT WE CAN CHECK IN WITH- NEVER CULTURE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY BIG NUMBERS I DO JUST WANT TO POINT A COUPLE SIGNAL RELATED INVESTMENTS WE DO INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET- ONE IN THE CLIMATE BOND THERE'S ABOUT THREE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S SET ASIDE FOR SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION- THERE'S ALSO AN ADDITIONAL FORTY MILLION GOING TO THE BARN WATER RESOURCES OF THAT FORTY MILLION THIRTY MILLION FOR CRACKS TO THE CRITICALLY OVER GRAFTED BASINS THAT HELP THE POOR PLANNING. RELATED TO THE- ECONOMIC MEDICATION ISSUES AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOOD NAG FOR THIS WEEK PROGRAM TO HELP WITH- WATER ENERGY EFFICIENCY SO WHERE ON THAT'S FANTASTIC BUT- CAN YOU TELL ME THE NUMBER THAT. IS AND HOW MUCH IS GOING TO. FIX THE OUTDATED CONVEYANCE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN STATIC. AND TO STOP THE WATER LOSSES THAT WE HAVE THERE. BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T MOVE THE WATER NONE OF THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE REALLY GOING TO BE AFFECTED. SO I DON'T THINK I'LL KNOW IT JUST GOING BACK TO THE CLIMATE BOND. THERE'S ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOCUSED ON REGIONAL AND INTERREGIONAL WATER RESILIENCE. AND ALL THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS THERE'S MULTIPLE TYPE THE PROJECT THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE ONE OF THE PROJECT IS WATER CONVEYANCE. THAT'S ONE OF THE DIFFERENT GOOD POINT THAT MAY BE ELIGIBLE WITHIN THE ONE BILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION AND THE KIND OF THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP. WITH REAL CROPPERS DECIDING ON WHETHER OR NOT CARE THEY'RE GOING TO PLANT THIS SEASON OR NOT. SO WHAT WHAT IS BEING DISCUSSED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN REGARDS TO THAT. I MEAN PUT PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR SHOES YET TO MAKE A DECISION TODAY. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO. THE DECISION THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO MAKE TODAY COULD SKEW YOUR ENTIRE BUDGET. THREE HAVE ANYTHING ON THAT. YEAH WE DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS OTHER THAN THE CIGNA RELATED INVESTMENTS AND WATER RELATED INVESTMENT THAT WE DO INCLUDE IN THE BUDGET WHICH INCLUDES THE BOND THING ALTHOUGH THAT IS THAT'S WHAT I THINK EVERYBODY'S AFRAID OF- TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE LA- IF ANY SURE YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON AND- I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW- BUT IF YOU GUYS CAN START LOOKING AT THAT SO WE CAN HEAR. PROJECTIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD OVER THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE BUDGET DEADLINES IF THIS IS GONNA HIT THIS IS GOING TO TRIGGER US I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE AT LEAST LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE NUMBERS- BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SURPLUS AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT IF THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS. IN THE VALLEY ACTUALLY DOES A 30% DROP. IT'S GONNA SKEWED ENTIRE THING. YES NONE. YET MR IS COMING OVER I'LL JUST NOTE A- WITH RESPECT TO- WE DON'T HAVE A MUCH MORE TO ADD SOME FIRST ON THE MIDST OF OUR ANALYSIS BUT- SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING ON THESE PROPOSALS MENTION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE. REALLY MORE DETAIL AT THIS STAGE ABOUT WHAT SPECIFICALLY BEING PROPOSED. SO FOR EXAMPLE WITHIN THE- CLIMB UP ON THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING TARGET TOWARD DIFFERENT WATER RESILIENCY EFFORT- BUT UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. HOPEFULLY FEBRUARY FIRST WE'RE NOT- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TYPE THE PROJECT WILL BE. TARGETED AND THEN- MY COLLEAGUE ALSO MENTIONED THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. TO ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF SIGMA- IN THE AREAS WITH THE MOST CRITICALLY OVER CRAFTED BASINS. IN IN AGAIN WITHOUT PROPOSAL WE'RE STILL LOOKING FOR MORE DETAIL AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. FINANCE AN APARTMENT CUT APARTMENT WATER RESOURCES TO GET MORE DETAIL ABOUT. EXACTLY WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS AND EFFORTS WOULD BE FUNDED. WITH THOSE DOLLARS. VESTING SURE THAT THE GREATEST PUBLIC BENEFIT- COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH UNLIMITED ORGANISED AND MORE MONEY TO STUDY WHAT WE SHOULD. ALREADY DONE. THAT'S FACT. OKAY THANK YOU. THE YOU ONE IS I. THINK IT IS CHAIRMAN. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL NEGOTIATED THE STATE'S ARE TO PUT THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE- NATION MY BANK SENTIMENT THAT THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS INTO A LEGAL ASSISTANCE FINE- AND THAT WAS TO PROVIDE FORECLOSURE HOTLINES SO THEN GOVERNOR BROWN- IN THE MAJORITY PARTY DECIDED TO READ THATFIND AND USE IT TO PAY OFF HOUSING BONDS. GOVERNOR BROWN APPEALED THAT DECISION- TWO DOZEN EIGHTEEN I REMEMBER BEING IN THIS ROOM VOTING ON THE BUDGET BILL THAT WOULD RETROACTIVELY DECLARE THAT THAT WAS A LEGAL AND JUSTIFIED MEANS- OF USING THAT SETTLEMENT MONEY. SO THAT WAS SB. ONE THIRTEEN. THE GOVERNOR FINALLY PROPOSED TO DEPOSIT THIS MONEY WITH A COUPLE OF CATCHES AND THEN ONE BEING THAT ONLY THE- REVENUE GENERATED- WOULD BE USED TO FOR THAT FOR THE HOMEOWNERS. I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU COULD ADD SOME INSIGHT AS TO WHEN THE- PLAINTIFFS IN THIS CASE BECAUSE IT DID HAVE TO GO TO COURT MAN AS YOU RECALL THIS WE WERE ORDERED TO DEPOSIT THAT MONEY APPROPRIATELY- HOW LONG IS IT THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WILL HAVE TO WAIT IN ORDER TO SEE ALL OF THAT MONEY NOT JUST HAVE A TRICKLE UP AT ALL OF THAT MONEY. GO TO THOSE FOR WHOM IT WAS INTENDED- COM IT DIDN'T HAPPEN LAST YEAR I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY IT DOESN'T APPEAR IT'S HAPPENING THIS YEAR AND WE SEEM TO BE SLOW ROLLING THIS AND I JUST WONDER IF YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT ON THAT USHER HAPPY TO- DISCUSS BRIEFLY SO I THINK THE FIRST POINT IS THAT YOU ARE CORRECT- THERE WAS A JUDGMENT. THAT THE PLAINTIFFS WINE AND SO AFTER THAT JUDGMENT- I BELIEVE THE FIGURE WAS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WAS- IS TRANSFERRED- I'LL GET YOU TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES OR RESERVE DROPPED BY THAT LEVEL- BECAUSE- IT IS FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSES THAT YOU MENTIONED. SO DE JUDGMENT BASICALLY SAID THAT UNDER THAT SETTLEMENT OF THE MONEY COULD ONLY BE USED FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES- SO THEY'RE BASICALLY- TWO QUESTIONS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THIS IS ON GOING WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE FIRST IS WHETHER WE WANT TO SPEND THIS ON A ONE TIME BASIS YOU TO SPEND IT ALL IN A YEAR OR TWO YEARS OR ESTABLISH A FINE TO WEAR IN ANY GIVEN YEAR THE LEVEL SPENDING WILL BE MUCH GLASS. BUT THEN THAT MONEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE YOU KNOW WHETHER THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL WHETHER IT'S A RECESSION LIKE THE ONE THAT LED TO THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH IS THE SECOND APPROACH- BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE DIFFERING. OPINIONS IN TERMS OF HOW SPECIFICALLY TO SPEND- IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN A GIVEN YEAR OR HOW TO SET UP DESTRUCTION FOR SPENDING IT AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT DO YOU SPEND IT ON AND SO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE JUDGMENT IS THAT IT THE MONEY DOESN'T. IT'S DOESN'T GO SPECIFICALLY TO THE PLAINTIFFS IT GOES FOR THE PURPOSE STAYS IN THE SETTLEMENT WHICH OF COURSE THE PLAINTIFFS SUPPORT THAT'S WHY THEY BROUGHT THE SUIT AND IN PARTICULAR THEY WERE TO THE AND- FOR. WORK WITH THE SETTLEMENT. AND THAT WE FOR APPEAL. A THE END. WHICH IS NUMBER RENTER- AND PROTECTIONS- FOR RENDERING HOMEOWNERS WHO WORKS.IN FORECLOSURE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE OFTEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEGAL ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. IN THESE VERY COMPLICATED PROCEEDINGS AND WE SAW THAT DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. SO THIS MONEY COULD HELP AND I GET SECOND IS THE BROADER CATEGORY OF BORROWER FOR WEEKS AND THAT'S A SENT OUT PHRASE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN THE ORIGINAL. SETTLEMENT IN TERMS OF THE JUDGE'S INSTRUCTIONS- AND THEN THE FINAL POINT YOU RACES THE TIME LINE SO LAST FALL- WERE THE INITIAL. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THE GOVERNOR ROLLED OUT HIS CONCEPT FOR IT- YOU ARE CORRECT THAT OUT IT'S ONLY A COUPLE SENTENCES IN OUR EIGHT PAGES IN THIS BUDGET- WE DO HAVE ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO TO ACTUALLY FLUSH OUT THAT CONCEPT TO US SO THAT WE CAN SET UP A TRUST. IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES OF THAT STRUCTURE. AND THEN GET THE MONEY FLOWING AFTER THAT- BUT THAT'S SOMETHING IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS MONTHS. WE WANT TO WORK WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. OKAY THANK YOU MISTRESS THANK YOU MISTER. OF MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN COMMITTEE- PROTECTION PROGRAM I TOO AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE REDUCTION FROM THE FIFTY MILLION TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION. SHE SO CORRECTLY STATED IT'S OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BEING ASSISTED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM THE INITIAL PART OF IT WAS THE VALUATION AND THEN THE FUNDING WAS GOING TO HELP TO IMPLEMENT THE VERY PROGRAMS THAT ALL THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS MAPPED TO DISCUSS THE CAME UP WITH A PLAN AND NOW THE PLAN WILL BE SHELVED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT IT. THAT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AREA OF FOR ME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHANGING THE FUNDING INSTEAD OF IT GOING DOWN WE SHOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT GOING UP BECAUSE WE FOUND FROM THE STUDIES AND FROM. ALL OF THE COMMUNITY. INPUT THAT THE NEED WAS EVEN GREATER THAN WHAT HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED. I AT WHEN WE WERE TAKING A VOTE SPECIFICALLY ON THE RIO THROUGH RE AUTHORIZATION OF CAP AND TRADE. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I VOTED FOR IT IS BECAUSE AB SIX SEVENTEEN WAS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION. AND TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME. THERE IS A SPECIFIC QUESTION ON THAT I JUST WANT TO. LINDA MY VOICE TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE HAS STATED. ON THE EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. THE FOOD WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S DEVOTION- TOO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS BEEN CLEAR AND I DO APPRECIATE- HIS AND CREATING THE CENTRALIZED GOVERNING SPACE. FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND FOR ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS I THAT'S REALLY APPRECIATED AND I- I'M HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR ON THE CREATION OF THIS PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT WITH THAT BEING SAID. I AM REALLY CONCERNED THAT THE BUDGET ONLY INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS- IS THE ADDITION OF CHILDHOOD SLOTS. WE ALL KNOW ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WITH ONLY TEN MILLION DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT. IT IS A SERVICE IF SERVICE PROBLEM- WE KNOW THAT THE OF THE INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF CHILDREN. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT. AND WE'RE NOT INVESTING ENOUGH WE CAN'T FIGHT. TO GET RID OF TO RADIC KATE POVERTY IF WE'RE NOT TAKING CARE OF THE VERY pTHE MOST- IF THE CHILDREN ARE. CURRENTLY IN NEED OF SLOTS. IF THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED OF SLOTS NOW ARE NOT GOING TO GET THEM THEY WERE FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BEHIND AND THIS FIGHT AGAINST POVERTY IS NOT GOING TO BE A FIGHT THAT WE WILL WIN. I DO WANT TO SHARE THIS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE IT IS MY PRIORITY THAT WE INSURE THAT OUR BUDGET PRIORITIZE IS NOT ONLY THE WHOLE PERSON CARE COVERING THE BEHAVIORAL THE DEVELOPMENTAL AND THE PHYSICAL NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE FAMILY CARE. I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT'S MISSING I WANT TO BE SURE THAT. THE MOST HOLISTIC APPROACH TO COMBATING THE VARIOUS NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES. IS WHAT'S PRIORITIZED. MY FINAL COMMENT HAS TO DO WITH THE- TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. TO FOR THAT TO DEVELOP NEW STATEWIDE REGULATIONS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE EXPOSURE TO TOXINS FROM INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES. IS THIS INCLUDE THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY. THAT IS MY QUESTION. CHOOSE A COLOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL I DON'T HAVE THAT AT MY- FINGERTIPS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. THANK AND CHECK. THANK YOU THIS WORKS. SORRY THANK THANK YOU I WON I WON MY COMMENTS AS WELL WITH WITH- MRS CRISTINA GARCIA AND MY COLLEAGUE ELOISE GOMEZ REYES AROUND- EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S JUST GETTING UNDER WAY I HAVE TO THESE IN MY COMMUNITY THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME PLANNING WEST OAK WE JUST GOT APPROVED RICHMAN'S IN THE PROCESS OF THAT. AND WE'VE MADE THIS COMMITMENT AND THESE ARE HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES- AND I FEEL THIS IN MY COMMUNITY SO I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS I SHARE THEM- TREMENDOUSLY SO JUST HAVE THAT COMMON AND I'VE TWO QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WE FOUGHT VERY HARD TO GET MORE MONEY TO CALVET. THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAM- IT HAD BEEN NINE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- IT WENT UP TO THIRTY. BY WAY OF- COMPARISONS THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE FOR ONE CITY IN CALIFORNIA'S NOW AT THIRTY- WHICH IS NOT THE FULL BUDGET REQUESTS BUT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPROVEMENT I SEE THE BUDGET NOW THIS YEAR'S BACK DOWN TO NINE MILLION OF REDUCTION. IN THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW WORK AND HELP REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND AGAIN THIS THESE HAD ARE KIND OF OUR HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES THAT. THE NEED THESE RESOURCES SO I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT. AND THE THINKING BEHIND THAT- AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD FOR YOU WAS- AROUND THE GOVERNOR'S NEW- APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS- AND HOW DOES THIS SORT OF. HOW DOES IT WORK OR DEFER OR COMPLEMENT. AND THE WORK TO LOOK LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING KIND OF WHAT'S THE VISION AROUND THERE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S TO HOMELESSNESS PLAN. YES SO ON THE FIRST POINT FOR CALVET- SO IN THAT PREVIOUS YEARS. IT WE HAD NINE MILLION DOLLARS BEFORE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT- BUT THAT FUNDING WAS ALWAYS ONE TIME AND SO IT WAS ALWAYS A BIG LAST- AS I KNOW. MANY OF YOU KNOW. TO RE AUTHORIZE A FOR THE COMING YEAR SO WHAT LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID WISE- MAKE THAT NINE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT. PUT A AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS EIGHTEEN ENDED UP BEING TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING- SO WHAT THIS BUDGET DOES IS BRING IT BACK TO THEIR ON GOING LEVEL THAT IS NOW. YOU KNOW UNLESS THERE'S A RECESSION OR SOME TYPE OF. MORE MAJOR SURGERY ON THE BUDGET. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE NINE NINE YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THEN ANY ONE TIME MINING. MONEY WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT- BUT THIS BUDGET DOESN'T PROPOSE ANY ADDITIONAL ONE TIME MONEYON THE ON GOING. OUT WITH REGARD TO THE HOMELESSNESS- I THINK THE WORD TO USE WAS COMPLEMENT AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THE ADMINISTRATION. IS THINKING ABOUT THIS IN PARTICULAR AT THE NEW FIND- WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS- THAT NEED TO BE RELEASED IN RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER AND- MY COLLEAGUES ARE WORKING ON THAT- BUT IT'S A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR FUND WAS THE LEVEL OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED. AND IT'S NOT REPLACING COUNTY OR CITY SERVICES ARE ENGAGING IN THE SORTS OF SOCIAL SERVICES. IT'S DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT THOSE BY NUMBER ONE TAKING A REGIONAL APPROACH. NUMBER TWO FOCUSED ON THREE SPECIFIC AREAS WHICH ARE STABILIZING BORN HE CARE HOMES- HOTEL MOTEL CONVERSIONS AND BROADER AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND FINALLY RENTAL SUBSIDIES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A REGIONAL APPROACH WITH ADMINISTRATORS. OVERSEEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- YOUR FOR THE STATE. AND WITH A LOT OF PERFORMANCE METRICS AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO WE'RE WORKING ON THAT GOVERNANCE MODEL RIGHT NOW- WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORKING DISCUSSION TO HAVE WITH ALL OF YOU- BUT- THAT. KEY POINT I DO WANT TO MAKE IS THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES WE UNDERSTAND THE ROLE. THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS THAT WAS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT FLOW TO THEM AS WELL AS CONVENIENCE OF CARE. IS JUST GOING OUT THE DOOR RIGHT NOW I KNOW THE GOVERNOR AND HIS JANUARY BUDGET. PRESS CONFERENCE EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION THAT IT HASN'T GONE OUT EARLIER. SO WE'LL BE TRACKING THAT MONEY CLOSELY AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE THE INTENDED EFFECT AND THEN. FUTURE BUDGET BUDGET SO I. WELL THINK ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT STRUCK. BEST FIT TOGETHER. THANK YOU MISTER. YEAH A COUPLE QUESTIONS- FIRST A ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION SIDE OF THINGS WE KNOW THAT THE REGION'S JUST PUT OFF THE VOTE TO DO A TUITION INCREASE OF THE SYSTEM IS VERY CONCERNING FOR ALL OF US WE- WE'VE- MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS LAST YEAR AGAIN IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET THIS YEAR. ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT INCREASE- AND HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING- WHAT IS. YOUR GUYS POSITION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT HE NEEDS TO BE A TUITION INCREASE AT UC. SO THAT AS YOU MENTIONED- GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A 5% INCREASE IN BASE LEVEL FUNDING FOR YOU SEE- AND THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE CLEAR THAT HE BELIEVES SITUATION INCREASES NOT WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. AND IS THAT ALSO YOUR VIEW AS AT DEAL HALF SO WE SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION. I MEAN BUT I MEAN JUST IN YOUR GUISES OWN ANALYSIS OF THE FUNDING. AND WHAT'S NEEDED AND THEN RESOURCES THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE A TUITION INCREASE RIGHT. WE SUPPORT THAT GOVERNOR'S BELIEF THAT THIS BASE LEVEL INCREASE OF 5% IS. WITH REGARD TO- THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. THE ONLY- YOU KNOW HAD HAS RECENTLY DONE AN ANALYSIS OF OUR CLIMB IT PROGRAMS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY RECOMMEND TOWARDS THE END IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REALLY START THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO REALLY INVEST THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS TO REDUCE CARBON. ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE IS- FORESTRY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES I THINK IN FACT DELEON IS ESTIMATES ABOUT TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS PER TON OF CARBON REDUCED- WE'VE BEEN MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS THERE BUT REALLY THAT'S ONLY HAPPENED YOU IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. SINCE THAT IS ONE OF THE MORE COST EFFECTIVE READ AND NOT JUST BY WAY OF COMPARISON OUR PS WAS ESTIMATED BY THE LA- TO BE ABOUT SIXTY TO EIGHTY DOLLARS. PER TON AND THEY SAID THAT'S ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF THE ESTIMATE- IF YOU TOOK INTO ACCOUNT OTHER COSTS LIKE INTEGRATION COSTS TRANSMISSION COSTS ASSOCIATED THERE WITH- STE THE SOLAR INITIATIVE HAS BEEN EVEN GREATER LIKE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER TON. SO ISN'T THERE AN ARGUMENT THERE FOR REALLY EVEN DO EVEN MORE. AND I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING THE INVESTMENT. YOU KNOW THIS IS ALSO I SEE PROTECTING US FROM CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE BY REDUCING FUELS. MEN ARE VEGETATED LANDS BUT JUST FROM A CLIMATE PERSPECTIVE AND BASED ON THE LA OWES. RECOMMENDATION I BE HAPPY HERE FROM THEM AS WELL. SHOULD WE BE DOING EVEN MORE. IN THIS FEAR WORDS A MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF REDUCING CARBON EMISSIONS FROM SO MAKE A SPECIFIC POINT IN THAT ALSO A MORE GENERAL POINT ON THE SPECIFIC POINT OF FORESTRY MANAGEMENT- AS YOU NOTED UNDER SB NINE OH ONE THERE IS THAT GENERAL TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- PER YEAR INVESTMENT AND THAT IS INCLUDED THIS YEAR AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AS WELL. IN ADDITION A NEW IN THIS BUDGET IS AN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THIS WHITE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND THAT SHOULD HELP WITH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT- AND SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE AT THE CUTTING EDGE IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE USING TECHNOLOGY TO REALLY IMPROVE OUR MANAGEMENT. OF THESE AREAS ON THE BROADER POINT I THINK I'LL JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS BUDGET- TAKES THIS BROADER TWELVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR APPROACH IN WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE OVERALL TO FIND A BUDGET WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A PHRASE OR AN APPROACH YOU'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS- IS EXACTLY YOUR POINT THAT- WE DON'T WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS A SCATTER SHOT APPROACH THIS PROGRAM SEEMS GUIDE. PROGRAMS YOU PRETTY GOOD TOO INSTEAD YOU WANT TO LOOK AT ALL THE INVESTMENTS TOGETHER AND THAT'S CERTAINLY THE GENERAL APPROACH THAT WE WANT TO CHECK WITH THIS BUDGET. I AM BROWN WITH THE LA AGAIN. MAYBE TWO POINTS MAKE ONE AS SPECIFICALLY. THINKING ABOUT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF OUR- CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURES OR OR WAITER DIRECTOR- OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TOWARD DIFFERENT CLIENT MITIGATION ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE DEFINITELY ARGUED IN THE PAST OVER SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS AND THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET PROCESS THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT SHOULD BE ONE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION- AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD IS IN SOME CASES- SUCH AS YOU REFERENCED- PARTICULAR WITH OUR RECENT pREPORT ON. ENERGY GENERATION PROGRAMS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO OUR OWN ANALYSIS OF- IN ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE COST BENEFIT RATIO IS FOR DIFFERENT PROGRAMS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT WIDELY FOR ALL- PROGRAM THE INITIATION HAS DONE AN ANNUAL REPORT BUT I HINK WE HAVE ANY. SORT OF VALIDATE ALL THOSE ESTIMATES THAT MAKE YOUR JOB A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE BUT I THINK MAYBE A SECOND POINT TO IS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN WHICH WERE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING. AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTACT OF AB SIXTY SEVENTEEN FOR EXAMPLE. YOUR OVERALL EXPENDITURE PACKAGE IS A BIT LOWER- THAN IT WAS IN THIS PAST YEAR. IN SO YOU'RE GOING TO FACE SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PRIORITIZE THOSE DOLLARS- THE INEFFICIENT COMPORT WITH ONE WAY TO DO THAT. BUT CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU- AS A BODY HAVE A DIFFERENT SET OF PRIORITIES WHETHER THAT'S BASED PACIFIC LAND COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OR THE OTHER TYPES OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE IMPORTANT AS WELL. SUCH AS- THE- CO BENEFITS WHETHER THE- REDUCTION AND OTHER- CO POLLUTANTS OR OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY INTEREST THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THE OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY AND- PUBLIC BENEFIT INTEREST THAT YOU HAVE. WE THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BALANCE IN CRAFTING AN OVERALL CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. JUST LAST QUESTION WAS ON ON THE- POST CLIMATE RESILIENCY BOND- I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE IDENTIFIED FLOOD CONTROL IS I MEAN. SOMETHING I BRING UP A LOT CALIFORNIA'S FIRE AND FLOOD. ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON FIRE. YOU KNOW FOR FLOOD A YOU KNOW THE CYCLES ARE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FACING HIGH WATER EVENTS. THE GAME WHERE WE DEAL WITH A COMMON THEME HERE OUTDATED INFRASTRUCTURE OUR LEVEES ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR AND IMPROVEMENT. HAVE YOU GUYS HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TRYING TO REALLY INCREASE THE INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE I BELIEVE THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOD PROTECTION PLAN IDENTIFIES TWENTY SEVEN BILLION. THERE WE NEED TO PUT INTO OUR OUR I LOVE THE SYSTEM- ARE WE MAKING INROADS ON THAT AND WHAT IN THE BUDGET ARE WE DOING TO REALLY ADDRESS. THE OTHER. POTENTIAL FOR CATASTROPHIC EVENTS IN FLOODS YES SO- I'LL- THE BOND THAT YOU MENTIONED- OVER SIX OVER HALF OF IT- IS DEVOTED TO A WATER PRIORITIES AND THAT'S MORE THAN FLOOD UNITS ALSO DROUGHT AND- OTHER ISSUES BUT A SIGNIFICANT PART OF IT IS- DIVERSIFIED PROTECTION I'LL LET MY COLLEAGUE SERGIO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFICS. BOTH THE DRIVER WITH THE PART OF FINANCE SO JUST TO KNOW THERE'S A OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS PROPOSED WITHIN HE CLIMATE BONTA SPECIFIC FOR FLOOD PROJECTS- THREE HUNDRED FORTY IS FOCUSED ON. US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEER PROJECTS IN URBAN AREAS AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY IS FOR SYSTEM WHY MORE TYPE BENEFIT FLOOD PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS- GENERAL FUND ONE TIME TO PROPOSED AS PART OF THE BUDGET. DELL SO FOR- THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEER PROJECT THERE WAS A BIG INFUSION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS THIS PAST YEAR SO TO HELP LEVERAGES FEDERAL DOLLARS. WE ADDED ADDITIONAL I DON'T WONDER HAS BEEN AN ADDITION TO THE- FUNDING FOR BOTH IN THE BOND. THIS REGARDING THANK YOU THE LAST ONE MISTER CHAIR MY IT. OKAY NO NO NO. FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU TO THE APARTMENT FINANCE IN THE ALLEY- FOR THE REVIEW I- LOOK I WON'T GET INTO GREAT DETAIL THE DAY WILL SPEND FIFTY HOURS TOGETHER THIS SPRING GOING OVER THE EDUCATION PIECE IN GREAT DETAIL AND ALSO WANTED IT TAKE MISTER TEEING IN OUR OUR BUDGET SHARE FOR. THE WORK IN THE- IN THE INTERIM LAYING OUT THAT THE BUDGET BLUEPRINT ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY DEMOCRATS AND- WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE MANY OF THE ELEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PROPOSAL SO I THINK IT GIVES US A GOOD STARTING POINT AND YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE LA- PROJECTIONS ON REVENUE AND THIS PLAN WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY MUCH THERE AND SO I THINK WHICH HAVE SOME FINE TUNING THINGS THAT YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE STARTING POINT FROM EARLY EDUCATION THROUGH K. TWELVE. THROUGH HIGHER AT THIS WITH A TOUCH ON A FEW OF THOSE AND THEN REALLY ASK ONE QUESTION SIX WILL GET IN DETAIL SO ON THE EARLY I'D MISS THIS YEAR RIGHT RAMOS LAID OUT THE COMPLIMENTS THE GOVERNOR FOR LEADING ON EARLY EDUCATION I THINK IT'S THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THE THAT CONSOLIDATION I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS WE'LL GET INTO SO WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT THAT AND NOT YOU KNOW PRE JUDGED YOU KNOW SUPPORTER NOT NON COMMITTAL NOT SUPPORT YOU JUST YET. AS FAR AS THE STATE PRESCHOOL IN THE PLEDGE. FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT AND IN PLEASE THOSE ARE. DOLLARS FULL DAY. FOR YEARS LOTS OF THOSE FILL BOTH THE PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE NEEDS FOR THESE FAMILIES- BUT AS WE HEARD EARLIER FROM THAT. CHILD CARE SIDE THERE'S- A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND. KIDS AND FAMILIES ON THE WAITING LIST ALREADY. AND YOU KNOW OVER A MILLION. THAT ARE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ON ANY WAITING LIST AND- THIS BUDGET HAS SIX HUNDRED SLOTS NEW SLOTS SO. THAT SIX HUNDRED FAMILIES THAT ARE. GOING TO GET LUCKY BUT THERE ARE A LOT THAT AREN'T SO. WE NEED TO DO SOME WORK ON THAT SPACE. K. TWELVE IS STILL A LOT OF JUST. INCREASING THE LC AT THAT FUNDING- BUT AS MISTER OBERNOLTE SAID. THIS WE'RE FINDING IT AND THE LOWEST LEVEL POSSIBLE THE PROP NINETY EIGHT- PIECES SO. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE THAT ARE STRUGGLING IS THAT NO THE DID A REPORT. THE LAST DAY OR TO TALK ABOUT WHY IS THAT HAPPENING SO WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY- KILEY SAID ABOUT THE FISCAL. CONDITION EVER SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCLUDING MY JUST RIGHT HERE SACRAMENTO THAT'S ON THE BRAKE AND RUNNING OUT OF CASH. AND THEN LASTLY ON HIGHER ED I JUST WANNA ASK THIS IS BECAUSE MISTER GALLAGHER ASK AND IT'S IN THE NEWS LAST COUPLE DAYS- FOR UC AND CSU% FUNDING. ON THE FUNDING IS JUST PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW. I KNOW YOU SAY FIVE PERCENT. GENEROUS AND IT'S BASED FUNDING TO COVER THEIR BASICS BUT WHEN WE GOT HOME TO OUR DISTRICTS I LOOK AT YOU MY MEMBERS AND SANDRA DINO AND SANTA MONICA AND ALAMEDA AND- SANTA ROSA. WE TALKED TO. PEOPLE INTERESTED IN HIGHER ED THE NUMBER ONE THING THEY ASK ABOUT IS ACCESS. YOU KNOW MY NEPHEW MY GREAT KID MY DAUGHTER. MY NEIGHBOR HAS A FOUR POINT WHATEVER. AND IS APPLYING IN THERE'S NO SPACE. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT CSU WE TURN AWAY LIKE FORTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED. APPLICANTS EVERY YEAR MORE AND MORE HIGH SCHOOL KIDS ARE GRADUATING TAKING THE A THREE G. COURSE IS. GETTING READY TO GO ON TO COLLEGE WE KNOW OUR ECONOMY NEEDS FOR COLLEGE. GRADUATES ITS IT'S- IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR. AND THIS IS A SOLID BUDGET FOR THE SYSTEMS. BUT THERE'S NOT ONE PENNY. TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR THE UC AND CSU SYSTEMS THERE'S SOME CSU I'M SORRY SOME YOU SEE IN ROMAN BUT IT'S REALLY A COMMITMENT FROM. THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SO. THAT I THINK IT'S AN UNFINISHED BUSINESS SO WE NEED TO. TO FIGURE OUT. AND YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU OPPOSE THE STUDENT FEE HIKES- JUST WONDER WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON. AS A GO DOWN. THIS BUDGET PROCESS. ON EXPANDING. THROUGH THE- ROLAND SO. AT THE UC AND CSU. SO THAT MY ONE QUESTION THIS MORNING THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THANK YOU SELDOM MAKE TWO BRIEF POINTS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS FARLEY SAID I THINK THE FIRST DAYS OUR BUDGET PROPOSES A 5% INCREASE AND AS- YOU KNOW THAT'S ON TOP OF THE EVEN BIGGER INCREASED AT THE SYSTEMS RECEIVED LAST YEAR SO WE THINK THIS IS SCALABLE INCREASES IN FUNDING- CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND GIVE THE SYSTEM SOME FLEXIBILITY AS WE WORK WITH THEM TO. INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND THEN THE SECOND POINT I MAKE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PLACED- NOT EDUCATION BOND OUT ON THE BALLOT FOR MARCH AND THAT INCLUDES FOUR BILLION DOLLARS UPON FINDING IF VOTERS APPROVE IT- FOR UC AND CSU AND SO A LOT OF THAT WOULD GO TOWARD FACILITIES SO TO THE EXTENT THAT SOME OF THESE ACCESS PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED BY A LACK OF AVAILABLE OR MODERNIZE FACILITIES. THAT MONEY COULD HELP WITH THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND THAT OF COURSE WILL BE SUSTAINED- BY GENERAL FUND PAYMENTS OVER FUTURE YEARS- AND MY COLLEAGUE MAY ONE LAP RACE WELL. SURE CHRIS FERGUSON PLAYING. I THINK WE WILL WANT TO ADD THAT. WALL THERE ARE GEN INCREASES PROVIDE APPROVAL THE UC AND CSU WE DID ESTABLISH IN OUR BUDGET SUMMARY EXPECTATIONS. THAT BOTH THE REGIONS AND THE TRUSTEES- CONSIDER THAT FUNDING IN TERMS OF ACCESS IN TERMS OF- AFFORDABILITY IN TERMS OF. CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW RIDE COVERING THEIR OPERATING COSTS SO WE DID. ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS BOULDER NO SPECIFICS WE WOULD AGREE WITH YOU- WE DID ESTABLISH THAT EXPECTATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO- A HEALTHY DISCUSSION ON THE TOPIC. SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT YOU CAN BE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. YUR MARCO WE'RE WITH. SPECIFICALLY IN THERE SPECIFYING IN IN ROME AT TARGET FREE TO THE SYSTEM. I THINK IT IS AT THIS POINT IT'S PROBABLY EARLY PRESS TO MAKE SUCH A COMMITMENT BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY- OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS RIVAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WOULD THINK- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE PRESENTATION AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OF COURSE THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR PREPARING- THIS BUDGET- I WANT TO COMMENT ON TWO AREAS IN THE BUDGET- FIRST HOMELESSNESS- I WANT TO COMMEND THE GOVERNOR FOR PRIORITIZING HOMELESSNESS- VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE INVESTMENTS- IN THE DIFFERENT- HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT YOU MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE NEW FUND. A YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE ALL FEELING THIS CRISIS- STATEWIDE URBAN AREAS RURAL AREAS YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A STATEWIDE- CRISIS AND- YOU KNOW I THINK I FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY THAT OUR STATE BE EFFECTIVE IN RESOLVING THIS CRISIS AND I THINK- THE INVESTMENTS IN THIS BUDGET SHOW THAT I THINK THE GOVERNOR ALSO FEELS THAT. AND BUT I THINK WE NEED TO RECONSIDER HOW WE STRUCTURE OUR ENTITIES THAT ARE OVERSEEN THESE PROGRAMS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS OVERSEEN THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- THAT HAVE TO DO WITH HOMELESSNESS- AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO STREAMLINE THESE PROGRAMS- IN AND MAKING US MORE EFFECTIVE AS A STATE IN DEALING WITH THIS CRISIS. THE NEXT AREA I WANTED TO COMMENT ON WAS THE CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND SPECIFICALLY I WAS PERSONALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE- INCREASE IN THE URBAN GREENING OF PROGRAM YOU KNOW IN THE BOND- LAST YEAR I THINK IT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER YOU KNOW THIS YEAR THINK IT'S ALLOCATE AT TWO HUNDRED MILLION- LAST YEAR WAS LOWER AND FOR ME THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AREAS LIKE MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES BUT ALSO- FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND- OTHER UNDERSERVED. AREAS WHERE THE DEAL WITH EXTREME HEAT IN HOW. THESE ARE IN IN MITIGATING THAT IN THESE AREAS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR I HAD A BILL THAT- PROPOSED YOU KNOW GREEN SCHOOL YARD SPACE- YOU KNOW WITH IN AREAS LIKE MINE THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH SPACE ALREADY OPEN YOU DON'T URBAN DENSITY. AND SCHOOL YARDS ARE PERFECT FOR THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY WAS VETOED BECAUSE IT WASN'T IN THE BUDGET. SO I LOOK FORWARD- AS PART OF MY THE BUDGETS OF THREE COMMITTEE AND WORKING WITH THE BUDGETS OF THREE CHAIR MISTER BLOOM ON HOW WE CAN INCLUDE- INVESTMENTS. IN IN IN THIS AREA SO THANK YOU. MR BLOOM. THANK YOU. I WANT TO JOIN- OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY AND FROM- BERKELEY AND- EXPRESSING HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THE ADMINISTRATION'S- EMPHASIZING HOMELESSNESS IS A PRIORITY IN THE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR. THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE BOB. SEC HAVING SAID THAT TO THE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REALLY IN MY VIEW FALL SHORT OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- AND I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE- THAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO DO MUCH MORE SO I'M- HOPING- THAT TO WHEN WE GET TO MAY REVISE TIME IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REVENUES AVAILABLE THAT WE WILL AGAIN EMPHASIZED THIS AND I'M HOPING THAT MY COLLEAGUES OF. WILL EXPRESS THAT MESSAGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- SO THAT THAT IS A UNIFIED PRIORITY FOR BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION- WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIORITIES AND THE NATURE OF THESE FUNDS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE IMPORTANT CARE ON WHICH I'M CARRYING SOME LEGISLATION AND- CORRECTING WHAT IS OF A BROKEN SYSTEM- BUYING UP HOTELS AND MOTELS AND RE PURPOSING THEM FOR HOMELESS WHICH IS IN SOME CASES A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD. MANY OF THOSE MOTELS ARE CURRENTLY INHABITED- AS LOW INCOME HOUSING SO THERE'S A DISPLACEMENT ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAN THAT BUT- WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A LOT OF. A GREAT PERMITS PARK HOUSING IN MOTEL LOCATIONS. OF AND THEN FINALLY- RENT SUBSIDIES- ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST TEN OF THE CITY OF THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE. INDIVIDUALS AT DAY OR BEING HOUSE BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS ARE BECOMING HOMELESS AND THE- MAJOR REASON CAUSING THAT HOMELESSNESS IS AN INABILITY TO AFFORD- THE RENT AND THAT ONE IS PAYING. A TWO FORTY THE COST OF HOUSING. MY POINT THOUGH IS THAT ALL OF THESE ARE ONGOING ISSUES THEY'RE NOT- REALLY ONE TIME CONCERNS AND SO I WANT TO URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIND AN ON GOING- SUPPLY OF FUNDS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY THIS YEAR. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO AWAY NEXT YEAR AND IT'S- WELL WE'D LIKE TO FOR SEE THE TIME WHEN WE REACH EQUILIBRIUM- OR BETTER ON ON THIS ISSUE IT'S NOT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS- AND IT CERTAINLY WON'T BE UNLESS WE PROVIDE THAT ONGOING SOURCE OF- OF FUNDING. SO I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACCOMMODATE TO- TO THAT REALITY. SWITCHING GEARS- I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION RELATING TO THE A BILLION DOLLAR- PACKAGE ON CLIMATE RESILIENCY THAT INVOLVES A REVOLVING. LOAN PROGRAM FOR SMALL THERE'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS YEAR BUDGET- AND IT'S A- THREE FOR THE OTHER STUFF FIFTY MILLION. COULD BE A ALLOCATE THE THAT'S REALLY UP PROMISES NOT A THIS YEAR BUDGET TO- OUT I JUST THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND TO OF THE ACTUAL DOLLARS HERE. BUT AGAIN AS WITH MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DETAIL IN THE IN THE BUDGET AND THE- NUMBER ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS- WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE GOING TO BE. IN DETERMINING WHICH ACTIVITIES RECEIVE GRANTS AND WHICH ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR LOANS. SO ALL SPEAK- MAKE TWO POINTS ON THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND- THE FIRST IS THAT TIME RIGHT NAME BY THE WAY THANK. THE FIRST IS ON THE TIGHTENING LIKE YOU MENTIONED IT'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE OTHER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS I BELIEVE THREE YEARS. AFTER THAT AND I THINK THE REASON WE STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY- IT WAS BECAUSE- THIS IS A BRAND NEW FIND AND WE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO IT BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME AS AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE HOMELESSNESS MONEY. TO ACTUALLY GET THOSE FINDS OUT THE DOOR SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SPEND- BILL OR LOAN OUT ACTION SAY SPEND ALONE OUT OF BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST OR EVEN THE FIRST TWO YEARS. OF THE PROGRAM SO THE WAY THAT IT'S STRUCTURED RIGHT NOW WITH TWO FIFTY UP FRONT AND CENTER FIFTY WAITER. SHOULDN'T REALLY IMPEDE THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NEW ENTITY IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY- AND THEN TO THE COMMITMENT POINT A WEEK TO HOLD IN THE- MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS OF THIS OF COURSE IS THE CHART THAT- GOES THE NEXT THREE YEARS. WE DO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EXPENDITURES FOR THAT OUT YEAR. GRANTED AT YOUR POINT WE COULD BE IN A RECESSION AT YOU KNOW ANY SORT OF THING COULD HAPPEN BUT- ACCORDING TO OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLAN. YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THAT AND DECIDE THIS IS- THAT SEVEN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS. WHEN YOU FROM. BUDGET NOT. THIS BUDGET YEAR BUT IT IS. SO WHEN WE TO ARE A- MULTI YEAR X. A REVENUE IN THAT OUT YEAR AN- PROJECT. HOW MUCH WORKING SPEND IN. YEAR WE ARE SAYING- THE EXPENDITURE FOR THAT YEAR AND YOU KNOW WE'RE ALWAYS THINKING WE NEED TO HAVE AN OPERATING SURPLUS IN THAT YEAR- THAT SURPLUS NEEDS TO BE AFTER. SPENDING SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY NINE DOLLARS IN THAT YEAR SO. IT IS IN OUR SYSTEM IT IS PART OF OUR SPENDING PLAN. AND YOUR POINT IF. IT IS TRUE THAT UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THAT YEAR. HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY PART OF OUR PLAN AND OUR PROJECTIONS- AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO BE AT. THE ACTUAL OPERATION WERE ENVISIONING THIS. WITHIN THE- INFRASTRUCTURE BANK- BUT ALSO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL. AND LABOR AGENCY PLAYING A ROLE. AND YOU WILL YOU KNOW AS WE PUT OUT OUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS. WE'LL BE SHARING SOME OF THE KEY AREAS AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN. ON WHETHER THE PRIORITIES OF THE GOVERNOR BELIEVES ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THIS FIND. ARE ONES THAT ALSO THE LEGISLATURE SHARES BUT THE THREE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A PARTICULAR. OUR LOW CARBON- TRANSPORTATION- SUSTAINABLE ON CLIMATE START SMART AGRICULTURE. AND WASTE DIVERSION AND WE BELIEVE THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE ONE THERE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR A GENERAL CLIMATE. FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE- NUMBER TO THEIR AREAS WHERE- WE SEE GAPS IN THE MARKET WHERE I FIND LIKE THIS- IS IN FACT NECESSARY- AND NUMBER THREE- THEIR INVESTMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE ACROSS THE STATE IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. OKAY WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE- LEGISLATURE IS ABLE TO PROVIDE. APPROPRIATE OVERSTATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS ON. ON ON THAT FRONT- FINALLY- I WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION. ON IT'S PROPOSAL TO MAKE A CALIFORNIA. A NO KILLS STATE I THINK THERE'S A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. PROPOSED ALLOCATION FOR THAT- I. THINK THAT THE. THIS IS. A PROGRAM THAT TO. UP TO YIELD TO RESULTS THE STATE. IN A STATE WHERE WE MANY. WERE ARE MANY FOR. OF DOMESTIC. THE SADLY UP IN SHELTERS ARE NOT ADOPTED- AND END UP BEING EUTHANIZED IN- IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- WE- SHOULDN'T SEE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SO I SEE GOOD THINGS AHEAD FOR THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FOR. I THINK HE WAS CHAIR OF FIRST I'D LIKE TO ECHO- WHAT IS A MEMBER BLOOM SAID THAT IN WHEN DEALING WITH ALMOST AS WE DO STATE NEED STABLE SUSTAINABLE FUNDING TO MAKE A DENT- IN- IN THE CERTAIN ISSUE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S PLAGUING OUR STATE- BUT THE TRANSITION TO- MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT- I DO HAVE A QUESTION IN TERMS OF ITS SOLVENCY- I UNDERSTAND BASED ON THE- MOTOR VEHICLE COUNTS FUND CONDITION. A STATEMENT THE FUND IS PROJECTED TO EXHAUST ITS REVENUE RESERVES BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE I KNOW LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE MADE SOME SHORT TERM- CHANGES LAST YEAR- INCLUDING- A FIVE YEAR PHASE OUT OF THE ACCOUNTING- TRANSFER OF NINETY TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE GENERAL FROM THE JOHN FUND- TO HELP KEEP THIS FUND SOLVENT- THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE ANY PROPOSALS ARE PLANS TO MAKE-THIS ACCOUNT MORE SUSTAINABLE- AND IF SO WHAT ARE THEY- CELL SPEAK BRIEFLY. TO SAY AYE NUMBER ONE THIS IS AN ON GOING AREA WHERE WE ARE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY AND AS YOU MENTIONED- THIS IS AN ISSUE LAST YEAR WE WANT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO. INCREASE THE LEVEL OF SOLVENCY AND SO WE ARE AWARE THAT WHILE WE ARE PROJECTING IT BEING SOLVING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. IN THAT FIFTY OUT YEAR WE ARE PROJECTING A DEFICIT AS OF NOW- SO WE ARE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY ON THAT. IF ANYTHING THAT I THIRTY ONE ELABORATE. YES THAT'S CORRECT- ARE A PRIMARY FOCUS AT THIS POINT IS ADDRESSING THE REAL ID. AND I'M SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN. OUR FOCUS THIS POINT IS ADDRESSING THAT THE MORE MEDIA NEED TO THE REAL IDEA WILL LOOK AT OPTIONS AFTER THAT OKAY SO IN TERMS OF LIKE PROPOSALS ARE ARE ARE SOLUTIONS TO MAKE SUSTAINABLE THAT STILL ONGOING. I'M SORRY IT IS SO IN TERMS OF WAS A WHAT WHAT IS WHAT ARE THE WHAT IS THE MEASURE SUPPOSING I GUESS IN DETAIL TO MAKE IT MORE SUSTAINABLE OVER. SOUTH SAY SO YET FOR THAT FIFTY YEAR WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW- BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT IT AND I THINK. THE CALLER WAS SAYING- YOU KNOW WE- CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE SOLVENCY THE FIND AND I THINK ONCE WE- HOPEFULLY GET THROUGH THE REAL ID SEARCH I AS YOU KNOW THAT DEADLINE IS COMING IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR- THEN WE'LL HAVE A BETTER SENSE. O WHAT THIS NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS WILL LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF OUR PROJECTIONS AND THEN WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT AT THAT TIME. OKAY IT DOES THE LA- HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS OFFER IN THIS AREA IN TERMS OF HOW TO MAKE THAT pSUSTAINABLE. TWENTY FOUR YEARS IS NOT. VERY FAR AWAY. I AM ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT IT TOO AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. WE'VE DONE SOME WORK OUT. LIKE BRIAN WILL BRIAN BROWN AGAIN I MEAN MAYBE JUST ONE POINT TO ADD IS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION- BUDGET YOUR PROPOSAL THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MORE MODEST FINE SHIFTS THAT THEY PROPOSED TO MOVE A COUPLE OF AMINISTRATIVE COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS IN MEDICAID DOLLARS OUT OF. THE NBA TO ON SOME OTHER SPECIAL TRANSPORTATION RELATED SPECIAL FUNDS THAT HELPED BY A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IN SO ARE- IS A HE NOTED THE- YEAR OF- THE FINE GOING INTO THE RIGHT IS NOW PUSHED BACK A COUPLE YEARS FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATE- IN THE PAST WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NBA- WE'VE REALLY SORT OF IDENTIFIED IF YOU KIND OF KEY AREAS THAT YOU ALTERNATELY CAN LOOK AT AND- WILL WERE REVIEWING THE FINE CONDITION AGAIN THIS YEAR. AS PART OF OUR ROUTINE BUDGET ANALYSIS BUT YOU HAVE- ON THE REVENUE SIDE THEIR OPTIONS TO INCREASE THE REGISTRATION OR OTHER FEES THAT OF COURSE IS SOMETHING LEGISLATURE DID JUST A FEW YEARS AGO- YOU HAVE OPTIONS AROUND IN THE OUT YEARS YOU REFERENCE THE- THE GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS THAT WERE SUSPENDED THAT- COULD BE MADE ON GOING- TO REDUCE SOME OF THOSE- DOLLARS AND MAINTAIN THEM IN THE NBA. FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME- IN THEN CERTAINLY- THERE ARE LOOKING AT THE EXPENDITURES OUT OF THE FINE AND SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THE MINISTRATIONS CURRENTLY PROPOSING- AND IS. GOOD PROPOSES FOR THE COMING YEARS IS TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE C. H. P. R. D. AND THE FACILITY RELOCATION THE RENOVATIONS- NEW PROJECTS- FUNDING THEM AT LEAST OF ANY BOND OUT OF COURT SPREAD THOSE COST FOR THIS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BUT HELP RELIEVE SOME OF THE- TERM. SURE COULD CONTAIN YOU BUT WITH WITH DOING THAT THAT YOU KNOW TO THERE STILL THE WITHIN TWO YEARS- NEED TO BE BIGGER. AND MORE ON WIN SOLUTION. I MEAN THAT'S THE BIG RIGHT ALL THE ALL THESE PROPOSALS I MEAN. I'M CERTAINLY NOT IN NOT IN FAVOR OF ANYTHING BUT I'D CERTAINLY THE- THAT THE BAND AID SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE DONE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND I KNOW IT WAS A MEMBER BLOOM IS AS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AS WELL. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE- YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY LARGE LOOMING PROBLEM THAT WE PROBABLY NEED O. TO REALLY START FOR HANDLING RIGHT NOW- IN PUSHING OFF YOUR BODY YEAR. IN A WORK WE WON'T WILL HAVE A LOT OPTIONS I GUESS IF WE GET TO TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE- AND THEN OF COURSE AS YOU MENTIONED IF WE CAN. DO WE GO INTO RECESSION OR REVENUE- CHANGES NO I THINK THIS WOULD EXACERBATE THE INSOLVENCY MY CORRECT. TO ASSUME THAT. SO AM I ARE THESE. I WOULD IS THE ONLY AS- IS SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IS. ALSO REVIEWING OR- OR A THAT ALL THOSE ON THE TABLE. YEAH SO ALL- I'LL SEE TWO POINTS ENDING NUMBER ONE WE'RE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT. ALL THE DIFFERENT- SUGGESTIONS AND PROPOSALS ON THE TABLE AND- WE'VE- MADE SOME OF THOSE CHANGES IN OUR PROJECTIONS- THAT THE ONLY A MENTION IN TERMS OF. POWER FUNDING FACILITIES- OUT OF THIS FINE DINO BOTH IN TERMS OF. HOW MANY AND THE TIMING. UP SO WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THOSE OPTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE. AND THEN SECOND IN TERMS OF FOR SESSION AND- THAT WOULD DEFINITELY AFFECTS. BOTH THE GENERAL FUND AND OTHER FUNDS- I'LL SAY GENERALLY THAT THE AND THE A- IS- MAYBE THAT REVENUE SOURCES A LITTLE BIT MORE. STABLE IN AS PEOPLE MIGHT NOT BE BUYING AS YOU KNOW NEW CARS THAT THEY WOULD BANKS IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE SUDDENLY SELLING CARS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE THE WAY THAT ALCOHOL MAY DROP OR CERTAINLY. THE VALUE OF IN INCOME OR CAPITAL GAINS MAY DROP- BUT CERTAINLY IN A RECESSION ENVIRONMENT THERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THIS FUN LIKE OTHERS. OF I THINK THAT AYE AYE BUT SHOULD COME AS I AND I THINK THAT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THE WHERE I THINK WE'RE NOT REALLY PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO IT AND I THINK BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO SO THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE- GOVERNOR OR THE HEAD OF THE BUDGET- INVESTMENTS IN THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY HERE IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA TRIAL. BUT ALSO- WITHIN THE BUDGET AS WE START THE DISCUSSION OF- THE BUDGET IN PREPARATION IN THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES THAT YOU'LL BE PRESENTING- IN FRONT OF ONE OF- ALLUDE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND CRISIS RESIDENCY TREATMENTS I THINK THOSE ARE AREAS WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS OUT IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE BEING AFFECTED. WHEN WE START TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES THAT WE START TO TALK ABOUT THE CORE OF THE ROOTS OF SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS ARE THERE AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS THAT'S ONE THING WE NEED CRISIS RESIDENCY TREATMENT LONGER TERM TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING FULLY EQUIPPED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO- BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE HOMES THAT WERE TRYING TO GET HIM TO. BUT ALSO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT OUR WAS YOUTH POPULATION ARE TRANSITIONAL AGE YOU ARE AGING OUT OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT COULD END UP BECOMING HOMELESS IN THAT SITUATION AND TALKING BETWEEN EIGHTEEN- YOU'RE ALMOST A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLDS IN THAT SPECIFIC AREA THAT THERE'S WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOOKING AT THE ONE TIME FUNDING WHICH IS PRETTY LARGE IT AND HUMAN SERVICES HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE ISSUES- AS FAR AS BEING PROACTIVE TO THEM SO THAT WE COULD BE ABLE TO TACKLE THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND IN GENERAL- CERTAINLY CRISIS RESIDENCY TREATMENTS IS SOMETHING THAT I'LL BE BRINGING UP IN THE DIFFERENT- SUBCOMMITTEE SUB ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE ISSUES AND HOMELESS YOUTH AND ECHOING ON- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- LUCID REAVIS IS COMMENTS ON HOMELESSNESS IN GENERAL THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT NOT ONLY IN OUR DISTRICT BUT TO THE STATE. SO I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAYBE HAVE A MEETING PRIOR TO SOME OF THESE- AREAS SO THAT WE COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE AND YEAH. ON WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING ON THE MENTAL HOW. AND THE REASON HE TREAT THAT ARE THERE. AS WELL AS OUR OUR HOMELESS- YOUTH. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU IT WILL MAKE SURE SOMEONE FROM OUR OFFICE FOLLOWS UP WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER. YOUR AVAILABLE MISTER ROSES QUESTIONS THE HOMELESSNESS- A BILLION LAST YEAR FOR HOMELESS. HOUSING IN IN SERVICES AND THEN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY PLAY BILLION THIS YEAR AND IN MY ISSUE YOU THERE'S NOT MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE REALLY KEY ISSUES ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS GOING WITH THAT OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE WE KNOW THAT'S BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME- ELISE BEEN OVER THREE MILLION SECOND- COUNTY SPENT. A LOT OF MONEY CITY ACTUALLY A LOT OF MONEY IN THE HOMELESS ISSUE AND THE RESULTS WERE VERY WERE MIXED THEY WERE GREAT RESULTS AND I THINK WHEN THE RESONS IT ME WITH A LOT OF MONEY AT IT. IN HOUSING JUST DOESN'T GET IT IT'S MORE THAN HOUSING IT WITH MENTAL ILLNESS I MEAN OBVIOUSLY SO IN THE STREET. AND THERE IS NO TRASK IN YOU'LL HAVE CLOTHES BUT YOU CAN BOOK MOTHER FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD BECAUSE NOT A DANGER TO THEMSELVES OR OTHERS THE DOCTOR CAME FOR A COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY WANT TO HAVE A BILL TO REDUCE FOLKS EARLY FROM THE HOSPITAL. THAT RAFI ONE FIFTY HOLDS BECAUSE THE HOSPITALS- ARE STUCK WITH A POSITION THEY CAN'T RELEASE PATIENTS UNLESS THEY HAVE A PLACE TO SEND THEM TO SO OUR HOSPITALS ARE OR WERE FLOWN RIGHT NOW SO WHILE WE'RE DRESSING PART OF THE ISSUE- WE'VE NEVER REALLY. ADDRESSED THE HARD PART WITH THE MIDDLE HEALTH BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU GET A COLDER SKIN YOUR KNEE YOU CAN GO TO A- CLINIC WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HELP FOR THAT THE BILL PARK IN DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ARE TOO HARD TO GET OFF OF BECAUSE DRUG COURT. SO I TAXI A LOT ABOUT IT IT LOOKS AS. IF IT MAKES RESULT THE MINISTRATIONS A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. IT ALSO BY THE BIG. ELF IN THE- IS CONSERVATORSHIP. ON BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S FOLKS ARE. OF LAW. IS WHOLE. A LISA CONSERVE. GIMP SOMEPLACE WHERE- WITH IT BEING TAKEN CARE OF IN. THE BUT THEY'RE ON- THEIR MEDICINE. IT MIGHT BE OKAY A. B. NORMAL BE ABLE FUNCTION AT LEAST- HAVE A PLACE TO EAT MORE MILLS. SO I SEE LIKE I SAID A LOT OF MONEY BEING THROWN. BUT NOTHING PERMANENT. AND WE HAVE A LITTLE INFORMATION FOR THE PAST EFFORTS OF CITIES AND COUNTIES. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE SO. I'M LOOKING FOR SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. YES A YEAH I'LL MAKE- TWO POINTED IN MY COLLEAGUES MAY WANT TO ELABORATE AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS- YOU ARE CORRECT THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY LAST YEAR AND THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY THIS YEAR BOTH IN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICARE PROGRAMS. EVEN IN OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT SCHOOLS BUDGET THERE'S MONEY THESE CAN BE SCHOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH- BUT I THINK THE WHAT- THE GOVERNOR SHARES YOUR BLOCK WHICH IS THAT. WHAT WE NEED IS GREATER INTEGRATION OF ALL THE SERVICE AS AN ADDITION. OUT OF TO THAT WHERE AN ADULT ALWAYS. YOU CALL THAT COUNTY THAT HELL CALIFORNIA FOR ALL ITS THIS YOU KNOW THAT. A CHANCE PROPOSAL BUT REALLY THE AND- NINE THAT. IS ALL. WE STRIP OUT AWAY. IS THESE ARE NOT. ISSUES EXACTLY TO YOU AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO REAL AND BEHIND THAT POST HOW DO WE INTEGRATE ALL THE SERVER. INTO THEM TO WHERE PEOPLE NAY AND THEN HAVE A DISH ACCOUNT OF THE- NOT. AT THE STATE WHAT BUT YOU'RE POINT. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SO THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDESOVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH OF THE NEXT TWO YEARS THAT ACTUALLY GOES TO THE COUNTIES. AND THAT'S TO HELP THEM UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS SO THAT WITH OUR HELP YOUR CALIFORNIA FOR ALL PROPOSAL AT THE STATE. THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY THERE'S A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH MONEY SPECIFICALLY IN THIS BUDGET. GOVERNOR'S ALSO PROPOSED OR SUGGESTED- THAT THERE BE SOME REFORMS TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE DETAILS TO. WORK OUT OVER THERE- BUT WE WANT ALL THESE THINGS TO WORK TOGETHER AND SOME OF THE REFORMS THAT HE'S HOPING FOR TO SEE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT WITH REGARD TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE- WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES BUT ALSO HOMELESSNESS ARE ALSO OTHER CHALLENGES. WERE TAKING A WHOLE PERSON APPROACH TO ALL OF THIS- AND THEN FINALLY ON THE SECOND POINT THAT YOU RAISE WHICH IS REGARD THAT CONSERVATORSHIP- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT THE GOVERNOR MADE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS AT HIS PRESS. CONFERENCE I DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS TO SHARE BEYOND THAT- BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY AN AREA IDEA ANY YEAH UPDATES TO THE WINTER WOULD BE TOO SHORT ACT. OF THAT HE'S LOOKING AT. ANOTHER WILL PUT THE VOTERS LIKE THEY'RE TALKING BUT IN THE ISSUE BUT I THINK LEGISLATION TO TAKE CONTROL OF THAT- WITH THE BIG THIS. BIG ISSUE I DID A COUPLE WORKPLACE ON. THE ON THE CANON CONSULTING. GREAT THIS NOT HAVE A SILO- THE ONLY THING IS THE SIM WE'VE BEEN- PRIORITIZE ENFORCEMENT FOR NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THIS- ON PAGE ONE SEVEN ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUMMARY. ENFORCEMENT'S MISSION ONCE. SO THAT'S WHAT THE FORCE TO LOOK LIKE THAT IS VERY VAGUE. SO I'LL TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE CLINT- WHO- CAN CHERYL MORE IN TERMS OF POWER THINKING ABOUT ENFORCEMENT THIS YEAR. IT WILL CLOSE COMING UP. I WAS LIKE A LOT OF THINGS FINANCES JUL DOWN ON AND THEN SOMETHING'S JUST VERY. VERY VERY VERY OPAQUE. THANK YOUNG APARTMENT AFINANCE SO I THINK- THE CONSOLIDATION- IS ONE OF THOSE PROPOSALS WHERE WE HAVE MORE DEAL DETAILS FORTHCOMING IN THE SPRING- AND- THE GOVERNOR AGREES THAT ENFORCEMENT IS ON COURSE IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MAKING- FUNCTIONAL CANNABIS MARKET AND SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THAT AS WE GO INTO THAT CONSOLIDATION EFFORT- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT- THEY CANNABIS TAX FUND- DOES PROVIDE MONEY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT. OF PARKS AND RECREATION AND THERE'S ADDITIONAL MONEY THAT GOES TO THE BOARD OF COMMUNITY STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS- AND THOSE MONIES CAN ALSO GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR YOUTH INTERVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CATEGORIES THAT ARE GROWING YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT THOSE CATEGORIES RIGHT NOW DEALING WITH AP AND MOST OF IT BEING INCIDENTS HAVE COME BECAUSE OF THE BLACK MARKET- CANNABIS. SO THE AGENCIES YOU JUST MENTIONED AND NONE OF THEM DEAL WITH THE BLACK MARKET. VAPING ISSUE SO THOSE ARE GREAT BUT THEY'RE ALL SEPARATE THINGS THAT REALLY DON'T GO THROUGH THE PROBLEM. WE ALSO NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC GOVERNOR'S COME OUT SPOKE PUBLICLY ABOUT IT DOT THE VP. BUT YET THAT'S A BIG PRIORITY FOR THE BLACK MARKET. WE STILL GOT A DEAL THAT IN THAT OTHERWISE THERE IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE VAPING. EMPTY WRONG ABOUT CORRECT ON THAT FACT. YES THIS WILDLIFE. NOT A NOTHING WITH THAT SO. SO. I THINK. THAT THERE IS AS FAR AS PART THE CONSOLE. EFFORT THINKING WE ARE TRYING TO. FOR LOOK AT ENFORCEMENT AND WHAT WE CAN DO IN THAT SPACE AND I'M CERTAINLY- BLACK MARKET VAPING PRODUCTS WILL BE A CONSIDERATION AND NOT ANALYSIS SO THE BIG THING A LOT HERE LUCKILY BODY BUT- WITH THE WITH THE- DEPARTMENT JUSTICE ARE BEHIND. A DESTINATION IN GAMING THE STATE. DOESN'T PAY THAT WELL SO THEY HAVE A RECRUITMENT RETENTION PROBLEM. SO TO LOOK AT THE STATE IS BEING ABLE TO HANDLE IT. BY THEMSELVES IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN REALLY DEPEND UPON LOCALS TO DOODLES ISSUES. A HAD THE BIG BUST IN LA WITH THAT ONE COMPANY WAS. ONE FOR THE BLACK MARKET ONE FOOT IN THE IN THE- PUBLIC MARKET IN THEY RELIED HEAVILY UPON LOCALS. TO DO THAT BECAUSE THE EXPERTISE HAS GONE UP IN THE STATE. WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN- DE FUNDED OTHER BUREAU OF NARCOTIC ENFORCEMENT THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE THERE. IN THE STATE TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES SO DESPERATE WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW. HOW THAT WORKS ENFORCEMENT PART LIKE I SAID. ALL THIS IS JUST ONE SINCE IT'S JUST MENTION ONE TIME SO THAT'S THE- SECOND SINCE THAT'S A GREAT CONCERN FOR ME ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET THERE. IF THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS VAPING IS AN ISSUE WE WANT TO. WE WANT TO DEAL WITH ILLICIT MARKET BECAUSE- OTHERWISE I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU I HAVE ONE FOOT IN BOTH MARKETS BECAUSE- ENFORCEMENT SELECTING A PAY MY FINE. NOTHING GOOD HAPPENS THERE'S REALLY NO. YOU KNOW WHAT TO SPEND TWO YEARS NOW ALSO FOLKS WANT TO COME IN. AND GET A LICENSE OR- DO THAT. THERE'S THE AMPLE TIME. POINT THIS US TO DROP YOU GOT A BUILDING FULL. THEY'RE HARMING OUR CHILDREN OUT THERE. SO I YES HEY I HEAR YOUR POINTS ON- THE LOCALS PLAYING A ROLE- THE BOARD AND- STATE COMMUNICATIONS FUNDING. WHICH WAS TWENTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION IN NINETEEN TWENTY GROWING TO FORTY FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SOME MONEY IS FOR JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ALLOWED FOR. LEGAL ACCESS THROUGH RETAILING CULTIVATION CAN RECEIVE SOME OF THOSE MONIES AND SOME OF THAT CAN GO TO PUBLIC SEE WHAT THE ACTIVITY IS KEEPING IT ON THAT THE MAJORITY OF JURISDICTIONS HAVE NOT ALLOWED. CORRECT CORRECT SO THE JURY AT MOODY'S GO TO CHURCHES THAT ALLOW IT SO THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS. WHERE THEY LIVE OR NOT GETTING THOSE RESOURCES. SO IT'S IS THE STICK ON THAT AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE OF THEIR THEIR WAYS TO GET IT BUT- STILL IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE ROOT CAUSE THE PROBLEM. SURE AND ADD THAT'S A CONSTRAINT THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE IN PROP SIXTY FOUR- THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED IN SO THAT WERE MOVING THE- PROGRAM ALONG WITH AS THE- INCENTIVE FOR JURISDICTIONS OBVIOUSLY I ASSUME THAT WAS THE INTENT BEHIND- THAT PROVISION. IN THERE RIGHT IT'S ALSO TALKED ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL LOCALS MAINTAINING LOCAL CONTROL TO. SO I MEAN THERE'S THINGS ON THAT BUT THAT'S JUST SO WE KNOW WE CAN WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT. THAT THAT IS THAT IS A BIG ISSUE. AND THEN I JUST HAD ONE MORE. ISSUE TALK ABOUT. THAT. ON THE ON THE PROBATION ANOTHER GOVERNOR- WANTS TO GO REDUCE PROBATION FROM FROM FIVE YEARS TO THREE YEARS ON FELONIES AND ALLOW THE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I THINK FOR SOMETHING'S FOR NON VIOLENT CRIMES ARE PROPERTY CLAIMS YEAH I GET THAT THE ONLY ISSUE IS. UNDER FELONIES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CHILD NEGLECT SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY THAT HAS MULTIPLE CONVICTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IN FOR CHILD NEGLECT SO IF SOMEONE GOT UP PAST PATTERNS OF THOSE PRACTICES THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL PRETTY SEVERE. DO WE WANT THAT PERSON OFF OF PROBATION OR DO YOU WANT TO MONITOR THAT BECAUSE IT IS DIFFERENT I MEAN ALL MISDEMEANORS AT BIG DEAL FOR TIME DO YOU LIVE MAYBE SOMEONE'S GOING ON I GUESS THE PERSON IS LIKE A BURGLAR. BUT AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW IT CAN BE A ONE COOKIE CUTTER SIZE FITS ALL I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS GOVERNOR'S INTENT FOR THOUGH IS CHILDREN HE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND SPOUSES WITHOUT SO. COULD HAVE BEEN VERY IT WAS VERY VAGUE. AND IT IS THE INTENT TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT AND TO. EXCLUDE THINGS BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST OF SOME OF THESE COLONEL JUSTICE REFORMS- WE MADE MISTAKES WITH THIS SO. I GUESS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THE ADMINISTRATION GET RIGHT THE FIRST TIME SO. WHAT WAS WHAT THE PLAN ON THAT TO DRILL DOWN MORE INSULIN THAT'S THE QUESTION. SURE I'LL MAKE TWO POINTS INADEQUATE CAN OPERATE IN THE FIRST DAYS AT A PROPOSAL- GOVERNOR OF LOOKING AT- EVIDENCE THAT SHE SUGGESTS THAT- FOR BETTER OR WORSE YOU KNOW WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OUT. HOW SOMEONE ON PROBATION YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT BUT MORE IMPORTANT AND THAT THE SECOND POINT IS THAT. THE PROPOSAL'S COUPLED WITH SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING. IN OUR BUDGET SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY. LOOKING AT THAT AND- SAY THAT PROBATION TERM DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS LONG. IT'S LET'S MAKE IT TWO YEARS BUT WHAT'S REALLY FOCUS ON THOSE TWO YEARS WITH. SIXTY NINE DOLLARS AND THIS IS NOT ONLY IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT THE YEAR AFTER THAT AND THE YEAR AFTER THAT. AND HOPING AND EXPECTING THAT WITH THIS ADDITIONAL- SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF SERVICES VERY INTENSIVE. IN FOCUSED IN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS WILL ACTUALLY GET MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES AND THEN. WHEN I WON THE LOTTERY. I THE ONLY OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT- AS WITH A POINTED OUT THAT AND MUCH OF THE RECIDIVISM HAPPENS WITHIN THOSE FIRST TWO YEARS AND THE POINT HERE IS TO FOCUS SERVICES AN INTERVENTION. AND ALLOW FOR AND EARNED DISCHARGE PROCESS. IT CREATE INCENTIVES FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THOSE POSITIVE BEING- MODIFICATIONS. AND WE'RE ALSO- HOPEFUL THAT THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT CONTINUE THEIR EFFORT TO USE RISK IN NEED ASSESSMENTS. TO ACTUALLY TO TURN THE LEVEL OF RISK INDIVIDUAL AS WHICH MAY BE ONE. IN THE CAN. KIND. SISTER DO YOU. YOU TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE THE EIGHT WHICH THEY SHOW BE SPUR AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE SUPER TO HOPEFULLY GET BETTER I'M SORT OF POP SAFETY OUT CHEN DO YOU KNOW THE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE LOVE FOLKS FROM THERE A VERY LOW YOU KNOW FOR. THEY'RE NOT SUPER OPERATION UNANSWERED REYES SO ONCE ABOUT EVERY CONTACT BRAYSHAW NO ONE EVER CA OF FOLLOW UP JUST OUT OF THE CHUTE THAT THAT THAT YOU IS QUITE LARGE YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE WITH CORRECT RIGHT SO I MEAN SO THAT'S- REALLY. DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT FLOWS FLOW STATE YOU KNOW DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAYS BECAUSE NO ONE'S A BALL. BUT STILL I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT MY QUESTION ANSWERED. SO WHAT ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF ALL THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND CHILD NEGLECT. IN OTHER CRIMES LIKE THAT. WILL THEY BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM IF THEY HAD MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS TO. I MEAN IT IS IF YOU IF YOU BEACH A KID MULTI AND- ARE YOU BE. IN OTHER. MORE THAN ONE TIME. MAYBE WE SHOULD KEEP  TIGHTER NO RAIN ON YOU JUST TO MAKE SURE AND NOT ALLOW YOU THAT TO YOUR WINDOW SO. IF WE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS OTHERWISE. I'M FORCED TO CONCLUDE IT'S A COOKIE CUTTER ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THIS. I THINK I THINK THAT THAT TO THE POINT IS THAT- AS FAR AS INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ON SUMMARY PROBATION TODAY OUR PROPOSAL IS TO ACTUALLY INCREASE THE UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPERVISED BY TO PROVIDING MONEY TO PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO SUPERVISE CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR CRIMES I THINK DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD LIKELY BE IN THAT CATEGORY BUT MORE THOSE DETAILS WILL BE RELEASED. ON FEBRUARY FIRST- BUT AND TO THAT POINT ABOUT WHETHER WE IT'LL BE IT WILL BE PICKING AND CHOOSING CRIMES ON THE FELONY SIDE AGAIN IT'S GOES BACK TO THE UNIVERSE OF MOST RECIDIVISM HAPPENS IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS- BASED ON SOMEONE'S INDIVIDUAL RISK NEEDS- AND THEIR LEVEL OF SUPERVISION WE THINK THAT THIS PROPOSAL MAKES SENSE- YEAH BROADWAY IN THAT. THAT THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE IDENTIFYING WHO NEED THAT SUPERVISION FOR THAT SHIP PERIOD OF TIME. IT DOESN'T TAKE PLACE. OKAY BUT I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD AN ANSWER TO THAT I MEAN I'D NHI&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOU'RE THE KIND OF&lt;/c&gt; DANCING AROUND IT MAYBE I'M NOT GETTING IT BUT IS THAT YOU GUYS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT THAT SOME OF THESE CRIMES AND THAT MIGHT DISQUALIFY THEM. FROM BEING IN THIS PROGRAM. SAID THAT THE SIMPLE ANSWER ON THE FELONY SITE IS O CARVE OUTS FOR CRIMES I WAS ONLY SPECIFYING THAT WE NOW WILL SUPERVISE CERTAIN MISDEMEANOR CRIMES IN THE CATEGORIES YOU DESCRIBED. THAT UNSUPERVISED TODAY BUT- GOING BACK TO NOT TO. TO TYPE MORE TIME. LIST OFFICE HAVE CASES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE THIRTY OR FORTY. AND THEY DON'T GET AROUND TO SEE EVERYBODY OTHER ACTIVE CASELOADS. SO THEY AREN'T SEEING THEIR ENTIRECASE LOAD RIGHT NOW- MINIMUM SUPERVISION SO JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE- ON SUPERVISED PROBATION. IS I MEAN THIS WAS COMING AROUND ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST ONCE IN AWHILE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE STAFF IF. YOU CAN GIVE THEM MORE MONEY. BUT THE AT THAT IS AN INCREASE OUR STAFFING. SO THAT YOU ONLY HAVE SO MUCH CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS SO. THAT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE SO I MEAN I WOULD WORK WITH YOU GUYS- I SPENT A LONG TIME DOING THIS BUT- I SAID IT IT'S THE IMPACT. AND I THINK. SOME THINGS ARE BEING OVERLOOKED WITH THIS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOUR OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIX SOME OF THIS BUT- I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNOR SOMEONE'S. I CONSIDER REPEAT LOW LIFE FOR BOYFRIEND BEATER- NO CHILD BEATER SLAP THE KID AROUND THE MULTIPLE TIMES YOUR PEOPLE OUT THERE LIKE THAT- THEY SHOULD BE SUPERVISED SO. BALLS IN YOUR COURTS OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. ALL RIGHT SO SEEMS LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A PRETTY COMMENDABLE JOB OF PERFORMING WHEN I WOULD. FEEL COMFORTABLE CHARACTERIZING AS THE CAPITALS VERSION OF SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE AND THAT'S ALL YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN UP HERE. VERY VERY DIFFICULT EXCEPT IN THAT COMPETITION THE CONTESTANTS DISSIPATE NOT THE JUDGES AND SEEMS LIKE WE'VE LOST SEVERAL JUDGES BUT NOT NONE THE LESS. MINE'S GOING TO BE SIMPLE. AND IT'S VERY A DIRECT. AND IT'S A LITTLE DISTURBING- AND THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET YOUR WE FINALLY STEPPED UP WE ALLOCATED A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND IS SUPPORTER STATES EIGHTY FOUR RAPE CRISIS CENTERS- THIS YEAR THAT NUMBERS DROPPED FROM FIVE MILLION. TO FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WITH THE RECORD RECORD BUDGET YEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. AND THE POSITIVE- ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. AND WE TALKED ABOUT CREATING TWENTY FIVE NEW DEPARTMENTS THIS YEAR. I FIND IT REALLY TROUBLING THAT- DID MINISTRATIONS CHOSEN TO DEFINE THE RAPE CRISIS CENTERS AND I KNOW YOUR YOUR ANSWER MIGHT BE THAT THERE'S AN INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. OF FOR ONGOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S COMING OUT OF THE- THAT WAS ALREADY A AN ADDITIONAL LINE ITEM- THAT WAS ALREADY. BAKED IN THROUGH THE PENALTY ASSESSMENT BUDGET RIGHT. IT COMES FROM THAT FUND YEAH THREE SAID USPTA STILL THAT'S A DRAMATIC REDUCTION FROM. FIVE MILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. NO SO I THINK OUR AT THE GENERAL APPROACHES SOME OF THE FUNDING LAST YEAR WAS ONE TIME SO THIS BUDGET BILLS IN THE ON GOING FUNDING THAT YOU MENTIONED THE ONE POINT EIGHT BUT- AT LEAST IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET THAT- BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR THE ONE TIME FUNDING WASN'T INCLUDED AGAIN IN THIS BUDGET THAT IS CORRECT. SO I GOT. THANK YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS FROM ME SO GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUE MS GARCIA'S COMMENT ON THE CAP AND TRADE BUDGET WE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS- REGARDING- SOME OF THE APPROPRIATIONS. ONE OF THE LINE I'M SO I WANTED TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT WAS THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM. THE IN THE PAST WE HAD COMMITMENTS FROM FINANCE OF COMMITTING TO A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BASELINE BUDGET MOVING FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY WAS SURPRISED THAT SEE THAT CHANGE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE CODIFIED ARE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION HOLES INTO LAW AND- IT'S FOR BROADLY- PROBABLY AGREED ON THAT IF WE DON'T. REDUCE THE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS THAT WE WILL NOT GET THEIR TRANSPORTATION AS WE ALL KNOW IS 40% OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT'S ALSO THE ONLY AREA. THAT CONTINUES TO INCREASE WILL ALL THE OTHER AREAS HAVE DECREASED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE SUCCESS. SO IT IS- LITTLE BIT PUZZLING WHY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD REDUCE THE ONE. CRITICAL AREA THAT WE NEED TO MAKE PROGRESS ON IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION. IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- AND NOT LAY OUT ANY SORT OF ALTERNATIVE HOW WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE TRANSPORTATION EMISSIONS TO REALLY. RECHARGE CODIFY GOALS. I'LL MAKE JUST TWO POINTS FIRST DAYS OF YOU KNOW BY NOW FAMILIAR WITH THAT SOMEBODY CHALLENGES AND HAVING LESS FUNDING THAN LAST YEAR FOR IT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM AND I KNOW THAT WILL BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION WITH. LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR- I THINK THE FIRST IS WHEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S OR WHEN THE GOVERNOR WAS THINKING ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL- IT WAS YOU KNOW MAKING SOME DIFFICULT DECISIONS BUT DID ALSO WANT TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR. I DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND YET AND MAYBE GETTING SOME OF THE FACTS AND OF COURSE AS WE SAW YOU KNOW NOT YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO CARE CUT AS WELL- BUT THAT WAS THE GENERAL FRAME OF MIND BUT WE KNOW THAT THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE POURED OVER BY THE LEGISLATURE- THE SECOND POINT I MAKE IS WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY TO LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION- WE HOPE AND EXPECT THAT THAT WILL BE AT. AREA FOCUS FOR THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND. THE COLOR. CLIMATE CALLOUS FUND IS FOCUSED ON. INFRASTRUCTURE CORRECT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE CARS TO CHARGE. WE GONA CHARGE THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT IS THAT IS GOOD POINT WE DO NEED BOTH. SO THEREFORE. THE THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH CLEAN CARS ON THE ROAD AND WE ONLY NEED TO FOCUS ON CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN REDUCE THE- COMMITMENT TO CLEAN CARS. NO DEFINITELY THE ADMINISTRATION THAT SUPPORTS FURTHER ADOPTION OF CLEAN CARS AND WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO THERE. AND HOW WOULD WE PROPOSED TO DO THAT. SO IT'S CERTAINLY CHALLENGING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THIS BUDGET- SO YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR PROPOSAL IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE ARE STILL FINDING THE C. D. R. P. IN OUR GENERAL BUDGET IT'S NOT AT THE LEVEL THAT WAS. LAST YEAR- BUT OF COURSE WHAT THE FINAL WILL LOOK LIKE WILL BE WHEN DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL OF YOU. IS THERE A- GREATER PRIORITY THAN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION IN TERMS OF REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES. IT IS CERTAINLY AT THE TOP OF THEIR AMONG THAT TOP PRIORITIES THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT- BUT AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER PRIORITIES INCLUDING COMMITTEE KEEP BY AIR PROTECTION INCLUDING FORCED HEALTH WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SB NINE OH WIND. SO IT IS CHALLENGING TO EDUCATE AMONG THESE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES BUT CERTAINLY THIS REMAINS A TOP PRIORITY. IT SEEMS THAT MOST THE TOP PARTY'S ACCOUNT. ONLY BECAUSE THERE'S LESS FUNDING OVERALL DOT THEN HOW DOES THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES FOR TRANSPORTATION GIVEN THE SHORTFALL IN. GREEN AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS SAID WITH CAP AND TRADE FUNDING IT MAY NOT BE AT THE LEVEL THAT IT WAS LAST YEAR- P. R. CERTAINLY  THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ARE HOPING THAT IN MAY THAT WILL HAVE A BETTER SNSE OF MAYBE PROJECTIONS WHETHER FOR THE CAP AND TRADE FIND OR- GENERAL FUND MORE BROADLY WILL INCREASE- BUT CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO DO THE BEST WITH WHAT WE ARE PROJECTING THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. NO UNDERSTOOD BUT IT'S SORT OF. AGAIN ARE THAT WE HAVE ON WE UNDERSTAND YOUR LIMITATIONS BUT AGAIN YOU HAVE A FUND THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN TRULY PRIORITIZE ME FOR EXAMPLE THERE RESOURCES BOARD WHICH IS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION THEY- GIVEN THE SHORTFALL IN FUNDS THAT COULD HAVE MADE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS AND REALLY FOCUSED ON ONLY CLEAN TRANSPORTATION BUT THEY CONTINUE TO ALLOW PLUG IN HYBRIDS WITH A- RANGE OF TWENTY FIVE MILES. SO IF I HAD A PLUG IN HYBRID FOR MY NINETY MILE COMMUTE. ARE GET ONLY TWENTY FIVE OF THAT WOULD BE CLEAN AND THE REST OF IT WOULD BE. DIRT BUT I WOULD BE GETTING A INCENTIVE FROM THAT PROGRAM. SO YOU KNOW I TOTALLY AGREE THAT. LESS MONEY MEANS YOU HAVE TO. BE MORE FOUSED ON YOUR PRIORITIES BUT IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR TO ME WHERE THAT FOCUSES AT THIS POINT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES IT THE MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE. WORKING TO CONTINUE ON THE STATUS QUO BUDGET WITH LAST. IN AND HOPE TO. ACHIEVE OUR GOALS. VERSUS FOCUSING ON REALLY WHAT ARE THE- MOST SIGNIFICANT PRIORITIES. AND WHERE WHERE DO WE FOCUS LIMITED RESOURCES RATHER THAN SPREAD FEWER DOLLARS AROUND ALL THE AREAS WE HAVE. IT TO ME IT IS VERY CLEAR IF YOU HAVE A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONLY AREA THAT CONTINUES TO GROW WILL GO UP. YOU COULD FIND AGAIN THIS IS PART OF HIS PROBATION YOU HAVE INFILL HOUSING WE KNOW HOUSING FURTHER AWAY FROM- JOBS IS ABSOLUTELY- A CRITICAL FACTOR IN TERMS OF THIS- INCREASING TRANSPORTATION MISSIONS THAT THAT COULD MAKE SENSE IF THE IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO SAY HEY WE'RE GONNA DO MORE INFO HOW TO WIN TO LESS. LESS CARS WOULD USE ONLY GOOD DO ELECTRIC BUSES AND INFILL HOUSING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO I THINK THAT TO ME THAT. I MEAN I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT BUT THAT WOULD BE A PROPOSED. RIGHT RIGHT NOW WILL BE HAVE IS. WE LOVE EVERYTHING PACK SO EVERYTHING'S GET LESS BECAUSE WE HAVE LESS MONEY. INTO ME WHAT WE HOPE IS DURING THIS. DELIBERATIONS PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE A BROADER DISCUSSION ABOUT REALLY WHERE WE CAN. I HAVE I THINK WE OFF THE SAME GOALS WITH KNOWLEDGE- THAT WE WANT TO GO REGIONAL SCHOOLS I THINK COULD BE COULD BE GREAT TO HAVE. A MORE IN DEPTH DISCUSSION EITHER IN COMMITTEE OR IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHERE WE- NEED TO PRIORITIZE BECAUSE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. I THINK WHAT'S- WHAT'S BEEN DONE IS- EVERYONE JUST GOT LESS AND- I DON'T KNOW MY CONCERN IS THAT. WE HAVEN'T DECIDED HEY THIS IS THIS IS REALLY THE- NUMBER ONE PRIORITY SO THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD GO. AND THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD GIVE MONEY OR EVEN MORE MONEY. AND OTHER AREAS WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT TILL WE GET MORE MONEY. LATER SO TO ME I THEY'LL ARE THE CHOICES DON'T. JUST TAKING CALC AND DOING SOME DIVISION ACROSS THE BOARD WAS A TOUGH CHOICE. IN TERMS OF- EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER- COULD COULD OU- I KNOW THE GOVERNOR WAS A BIG SUPPORTER OF EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WE HAVE. A LOT OF VERY HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO JUST. DON'T HAVE DOCUMENTATION BUT THEY'RE WORKING. THEY ARE WORKING POOR- COULD YOU ELIMINATE WHY- PERHAPS THOSE FOLKS WERE NOT INCLUDED INTO THIS JANUARY PROPOSAL. YEAH SO THERE- SO AS YOU KNOW THE I. T. C. YOU KNOW AN AXE LAST YEAR THIS BUDGET FINDS IT AT THE SAME LEVEL AND THOSE FIRST CHECKS YOU KNOW I GUESS NOW IT'S JANUARY WILL BE GOING OUT RELATIVELY SOON AS PEOPLE START FILING YOUR TAXES. FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TAX YEAR. I THINK IN THIS BUDGET- IT WAS SIMPLY A MATTER OF SPACE YOU KNOW THAT- EXPANDING TO THAT POPULATION WILL COST. YOU KNOW OVER A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE TAX CREDIT- AND AS YOU KNOW THE BUDGET MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER- INVESTMENTS- HELP UNDOCUMENTED% INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ESPECIALLY. ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE- SO THIS WAS SIMPLY A MATTER OF THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE FACED. OKAY THANK. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT IN TERM OF SO THAT THE HOMELESS IS PROPOSAL TRADITIONALLY THE LAST TWO BUDGETS WE'VE- PROPOSE MONEY ONE TIME MONEY- THE MONEY WAS MANAGE FINE EACH CD. THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY- ASKING THE S. S. TO MANAGE A DIFFERENT. PART OF FUNDS COULD YOU EXPLAIN SORT OF Y. Y. DSS AND GIVEN THE- AS YOU MENTION THE COMPLEMENTARY NATURE OF THE DIFFERENT FUNDED PROGRAMS HOW WOULD. HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE. TO STATE. DEPARTMENTS WHO DON'T ALWAYS. TALK TALK TO EACH OTHER AND COORDINATE THIS THIS FUNDING WHICH TO ME SEEMS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF ALL. YEAH SO MAKE TWO POINTS HAVING FIRST DAYS AT AS YOU KNOW YOU KNOW FROM YOU HOW WE DESCRIBE TO FIND IT'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AND WE'RE NOT. TRYING TO REPLACE COUNTIES BUT BETWEEN RENTAL SUBSIDIES IMPORTANT THEIR HOMES AND WE DO HOPE TO CONNECT MORE PEOPLE TO SERVICES- WE DID FEEL THAT DSS IS THE MOST. APPROPRIATE VEHICLE- AND GRANTED THERE'S A LOT IN THIS SPACE IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN BE BETTER ORGANIZED- THE GOVERNOR EVEN SIGNALED AND IS EIGHT PAGES ALTHOUGH THIS WILL BE A LONGER TERM PROPOSITION THAT. HE'S EXPLORING THE CREATION OF A UNIFIED WHOLE HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY- SO DEFINITELY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AND I THINK THE SECOND POINT I MAKE- WHICH IS UNSATISFYING RIGHT NOW BUT- WHEN THE NEXT. COUPLE WEEKS IS THAT WE ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON THE DETAILS OF THIS WE KNOW. IT'S NEW AND IT'S NOT A FULL DETAIL AT THE LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY EVALUATING THE SIGNIFICANT WAY RIGHT NOW. SO LITERALLY DAYS IF NOT WEEKS IT WOULD SET OF WERE REALLY DAYS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT THIS FIRST- COUPLE DETAIL AND THEN WE WILL DISCUSS. WITH YOU ALL THIS. PROPOSAL. AS YOU HEARD. ALWAYS DAHLE WE ALL OF. WAS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE- MORE ONE OR TWO TOP PRIORITIES REALLY THE YEAR DOT ALONG WITH. REALLY WHAT'S GOING ON WITH WHAT FIRES SEEMS TO. VERY MUCH SORT OF TOP OF MIND AS WELL AS VERY. IN ALL OF OUR CAN. SO WE GOING TO VERY. SUPPORT IN THIS. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE AGENCIES ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THAT ARE WORKING COMPLEMENTARY AND SAYS YOU HAD MENTIONED. AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD IS THAT THE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER. BUT THE CONCERN IS WHEN YOU HAVE. TO AGENCIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY SILO WHO. REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY KIND OF. WORKING RELATIONSHIP- TO PASS THEM. REALLY TO. DEAL WITH. HILL THE MAJOR ISSUE OF THE I THINK WAS ASKING QUITE BECAUSE ASKING QUITE A BIT I THINK THE- IDEA OF HAVING A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AGENCIES A REALLY INTRIGUING IDEA. ON IN REALLY ELEVATING THE PRIORITY WE KNOW THAT WE DIDN'T GET TO THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS LAST YEAR WAS ONE THAT WAS CREATED- EVEN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS AND- SOME OF THE HOUSING CRISIS IN IT IN IT DOES- IT DOES. SEEM LIKE IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO REALLY ELEVATE THE ISSUE. TO A HIGHER LEVEL KNOWING THAT EVEN. IN THIS ADMINISTRATION'S TENURE WE PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO SOLVE. THE PROBLEM GIVEN JUST HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CONSTRUCT HOUSING. ELEMENT TAKES TO CONSTRUCT- PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. HE IF EVERYTHING WENT PERFECTLY DURING ALL OF OUR TENURE WE CAN ONLY HOPE TO. REALLY MAKE A DENT GOING INTO THE TO THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION FRANKLY. ON REALLY ELEVATING THE- ISSUE I THINK WOULD. MAKE A LOT OF SENSE AND ALSO MOST POORLY ENSURE THAT WE HAVE COORDINATION. BETWEEN ALL THE VARIOUS AGENCIES WHO ARE REALLY. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WE YOU KNOW WE WERE VERY PROUD TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR. ON NOT JUST ON HOMELESSNESS FUNDING BUT ALSO AROUND EVERY HEALTH ISSUES WE KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT IS. A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE BUT- SINCE THAT FIRMLY FOR AND THE- HERE HUMANS PUBLIC HEALTH AREA AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS THAT COORDINATION THIS IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT. SO AGAIN WE KNOW THAT- YEAH THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS- TOP PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS AS ALLOWS FOR MANY OF US WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUR DIALOGUE IN TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE. TO MAKE IT RIGHT. HAVING SAID THAT LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW JUST FINAL COMMENTS JUST TO REITERATE I THINK WHERE WE STARTED- WE THINK THAT THIS BUDGET IS A VERY GOOD BUDGET- OVERALL I BELIEVE THAT IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS A LOT OF THE DIALOGUE THAT WENT ON DURING THE RECESS I KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE THINK DURING RECESS WORK ON AND OFF AT HOME ON VACATION I DON'T REALLY SEE MUCH OF THE WORK THAT HAPPENS EITHER HERE IN SACRAMENTO OR IN OUR HOME DISTRICTS- WE THINK THIS BUDGET REFLECTS MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION PICKING UP FROM WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST JUNE. MANY ITEMS THAT AGAIN WERE- WEREN'T ABLE TO BE IN A BUDGET WHICH IS ALWAYS WHAT HAPPENS WERE OR VERY HAPPY SEE APPEAR IN THIS JANUARY ALSO I KNOW A NUMBER OF MY LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WERE WERE VERY HAPPY AND VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND IT REALLY- AGAIN WHICH DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS DIALOGUING WITH THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE PROPOSING SOMETHING IN JANUARY WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT- THANKS. I'D LIKE LIKE WHAT. TO HAVE A NUMBER VERY COMPLEX BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ALL OF THEM CAN BE READY ON JAN TEN BUT- THAT THE SOONER OR WEEK AT- EVEN AN OUTLINE OF INFORMATION THAT THE BETTER SO THAT WE CAN HAVE YOU KNOW SOME DIALOGUE AND DISCUSSION AND WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE. MANY OF THESE PLACES ARE GOING- WE VERY MUCH FROM. THE COMMITTEES POINT OF VIEW I THINK VERY MUCH ARE IN LINE OVERALL WITH THE- OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THE BUDGET- WE SEE MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN. YOU KNOW FIGHTING FOR. IN THIS BUDGET AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF FLUSH OUT SOME OF THE DETAILS ALONG THOSE LINES SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE. THAT THAT DALOGUE GOING BACK AND FORTH- WE LOOK FORWARD AGAIN TO SING ALL THE- DEPARTMENT FINANCE STAFF AT ALL OF OUR VERY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARINGS REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR HARD WORK AND THEIR PARTICIPATION- DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IT'S ALWAYS A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL. OF THE EFFORT THAT THEY PUT INTO IT- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOMETIMES- WE CAN'T HAVE THIS FULL DISCUSSION IF WE DON'T GET SOME OF THAT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BECAUSE- A LOT OF TIMES EVEN THOUGH. THE HIGHLIGHT SOME GOOD A LOT OF THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS AND SO WE REALLY. DO APPRECIATE GETTING THOSE GETTING SOME LEVEL OF DETAIL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO WITH THAT AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EVERYBODY FOR COMING AND PARTICIPATING AND WE WILL BE ADJOURNING THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET.
