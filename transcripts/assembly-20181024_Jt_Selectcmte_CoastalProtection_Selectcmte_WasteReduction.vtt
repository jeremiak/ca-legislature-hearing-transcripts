WEBVTT

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:08.742
Good morning everyone.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.944
Welcome to a joint select

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.911
committee hearing a plastic

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.581
pollution and its effect on the

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.683
California coast my name is mark

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.418
stone on the chair of select

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:19.619
committee on coastal protection

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:20.520
and access.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:21.454
To California's natural

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:25.291
resources I am joined today by

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.160
other something members.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.261
Assembly member Kevin McCarty

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.063
who.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.967
Select committee on it what.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.169
I was waste reduction is waste

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:38.671
reduction.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:39.739
This not committee on coastal

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:40.907
protection we've done a number

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.776
of things around threats to the

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:43.777
cause of our men including

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.545
classic ocean pollution things

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:45.812
and so.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.547
As we can't really talk about

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.382
plastic and pollution without.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.351
The waste management waste

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.487
reduction issue and that's why

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.355
Mister McCarty I decided it

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.057
would be a good idea to do a

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.092
joint hearing on that.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.960
We also have seventy members off

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.095
Kalra and were Friedman who are

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:03.897
joining us here today.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.999
So often times when we go out to

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:06.966
the district with select

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:07.934
committees are not.

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.003
Always well attended by a

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.772
legislator have some significant

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.807
legislators and will give

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.675
everyone a chance. To speak a

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.477
little bit of logistics there

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:18.511
some parking information on the

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.513
table by the doors if you have

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.415
not registered your vehicle

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.217
using that parking information.

00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:24.784
You might end up with that

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:25.218
ticket.

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:27.353
So feel free to grab one of

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.223
those and make sure that you are.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.057
Officially logged into the

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:32.158
system so that you don't get a

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.060
ticket restrooms are out to the

00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:36.162
left you'll notice we close the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.931
blinds behind this to the bill

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.799
try to pay some attention to us

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.700
and not to the incredible scene

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.735
had is actually out though.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.738
Out the windows and out the door

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.440
but feel free. To get up and

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:47.774
move around.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:49.375
As necessary.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.378
So I just wanted to make sure

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.447
that we frame this as talking

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:55.281
about pollution in the marine

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.051
environment and how we are

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.086
responsible for waste reduction

00:02:00.153 --> 00:02:01.988
and from my standpoint.

00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:03.857
Waste reduction is really not

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.758
only about the back and cleaning

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.861
up what's there but trying to be

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.662
responsible how we understand

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.698
products product manufacturing.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.634
The whole retail chain so that

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.569
every product especially with

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.438
plastic plastic packaging war

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.341
parts that are single use or

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:23.209
short duration use.

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.178
We have a way of collecting and

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.113
managing that responsibly.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.148
If we doubt what we see often is

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.017
that that ends up.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.886
In the creeks rivers and

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.787
watersheds and ultimately out

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:36.055
into the ocean and even though

00:02:36.122 --> 00:02:37.790
ram the Monterey Bay very proud

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:38.958
that we have so many people

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.927
willing to go out and do coastal

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.629
cleanup days.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:43.897
Add we have been working with

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.532
state parks.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.399
Because we have a lot of beach

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.302
side state parks and the county

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.304
cities to put their resources

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.373
available to clean up the beach

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.341
is it should not is an issue

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.011
that should not always fall on

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.112
the volunteers for the local

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.914
jurisdictions to be responsible

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.948
to clean up.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.850
Think we need a broader.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:04.918
Policies and and more

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.819
comprehensive solutions where

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.721
everyone is engaged in taking

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.823
some responsibility for helping

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.625
address the plastic waste

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.560
problem.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.428
And so this is where we're going

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:16.729
to explore a number of issues

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:18.531
around the coastline look at

00:03:18.598 --> 00:03:20.433
some next steps and then take

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.434
some public comment.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:24.170
So many turn the microphone over

00:03:24.237 --> 00:03:25.405
to coach chair this Mister

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.639
McCarty and then ask the other

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.342
so members to weigh in before we

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.010
get to the past.

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:32.345
Good morning thank you for all

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.913
coming out.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.782
Today and then thank you --

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.684
Someone member stone for walk

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.819
beautiful district and I don't

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.020
think you could have picked a

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.622
better location.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:43.756
No you don't trust has which is

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:44.958
why you close the blinds behind

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.693
this -- And

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.394
you know you got you represent

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:49.562
the coast here but it's

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.630
important that we all on the

00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:52.599
coast. Forty million

00:03:52.665 --> 00:03:54.233
Californians whether or not you.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.168
Live in a coastal community as

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.135
well.

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.503
And that we want to make sure we

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.205
preserve the coast for future

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.140
generations but also in

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:01.941
districts like mine we have.

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:03.810
Rivers and streams and creeks

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.712
and other plastic issues impact

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.113
those areas and of course the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.848
end up and in the day in the

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:09.916
ocean as well so --

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.518
I serve on the natural resources

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:12.852
committee --

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.520
With you and I and I also chair

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.422
of the select committee on waste

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.391
reduction and recycling so --

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.393
Plastics and its impact the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.328
environment and recycling waste

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.663
reduction all kind of go hand in

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.163
hand.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.133
And this hearing today is an

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.201
important opportunity. For us

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.937
understand --

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:33.840
The the dynamics of the issue

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.742
see here in California as well

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.744
as a potential remedies that --

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.812
That would be key looking at ten

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.581
twenty nineteen and beyond and I

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.616
certainly look forward.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:45.485
To our panelists and our public

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.520
discussion here today and to get

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:48.154
a look for to today's here thank

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:50.323
you.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.392
Thank you misread.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.459
Thank you I want to first thank

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.260
the chairs --

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:56.162
Chair McCarty ensure stone for

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.296
holding this hearing and

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.197
inviting.

00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.265
Your colleagues and the public

00:04:59.332 --> 00:05:01.968
to join us I represent for

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:02.969
cities in Los Angeles Los

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:04.871
Angeles county including part of

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:05.838
the city of Los Angeles.

00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:06.973
So will my district does not

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.775
touch the coastline certainly my

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:09.075
city does.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.611
Anna's chair McCarty said we all

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.513
have ownership of the coastlines

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:13.880
in California.

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:15.515
The justice last week I was

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.683
horrified to see a story in the

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.518
LA times about how we are

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.486
literally eating salt by eating

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:21.354
plastic.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.222
Because of the amount of micro

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.258
of micro pollution that's

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:27.260
entered the food stream through

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.061
salt and other products.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:29.095
So this is something that's on

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.997
the mind of of myself and

00:05:31.064 --> 00:05:31.964
certainly of my constituents.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:32.899
Think we're starting to

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:34.133
understand the scope of the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.868
problem in terms of the public

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:36.769
understanding.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.105
But all of us are struggling to

00:05:39.172 --> 00:05:40.673
find solutions.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.543
With some concrete actions that

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:44.577
we can take over the next

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.446
legislative session next couple

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:47.580
of years to start really

00:05:47.647 --> 00:05:49.382
tackling this problem.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.186
Thank you score.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:54.187
Thank you.

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.055
Chair stone Chen McCarty and and

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.024
my colleague summer Friedman --

00:05:58.091 --> 00:06:00.960
Oskol representing some it is a

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:01.561
twenty seven over the hill in

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:01.894
San Jose.

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:04.897
And my echo the comments of my

00:06:04.964 --> 00:06:06.866
colleagues here and this would

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:08.668
add that --

00:06:08.735 --> 00:06:10.703
As high as often times in the

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.572
case special last --

00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:14.474
Of input in in recent years --

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.477
Ill California's not only that

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.845
in terms of trying to see what

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:21.280
we can do to prevent Harmon --

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.248
In our own jurisdiction but

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:23.249
really it.

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:25.118
I think we have a responsibility

00:06:25.184 --> 00:06:27.320
to wrestle world should ever

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.221
weekend in partnering up with so

00:06:28.287 --> 00:06:29.255
many others around the world are

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:31.057
trying to deal.

00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:36.729
With the issue of our oceans

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:37.797
event plastics --

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.832
Of from continuing. To invade

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.833
our oceans --

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.035
Sea level rise and on and on and

00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.437
on these are issues that affect

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:45.571
California and and all

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:46.773
California's matter where they

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:47.473
live.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.342
But it's also a global issue and

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:51.344
I think it's one more area where

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.311
we need to lead --

00:06:52.378 --> 00:06:54.280
And as global leaders and and

00:06:54.347 --> 00:06:55.348
I'm grateful to be able to serve.

00:06:55.414 --> 00:06:57.150
A with leaders like those that

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.217
are at the table here with me

00:06:58.284 --> 00:07:00.019
and and certainly --

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.855
I'm interested in learning from

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:03.856
the folks committee speaking

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:04.857
today -- And

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:06.058
and I really appreciate these

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:07.960
kinds hearings because it gives

00:07:08.027 --> 00:07:08.895
us opportunity when we're in our

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:10.630
off season or not in the

00:07:10.696 --> 00:07:12.765
legislative cycle to repair what

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.500
comes next what we need to do.

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:17.670
To continue to to lead on our

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.305
state for its of thank you.

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:20.506
Thank you ending it is

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:21.474
significant to have some Inland

00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.542
legislators here and and I know

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.209
we have all worked.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:25.278
Very closely on some significant

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:27.113
environmental policy.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.347
But it is true the Californians

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:30.883
feel an owner it is a good

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.018
resource it's part of

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.085
Californians identity.

00:07:33.152 --> 00:07:34.821
And as a formal.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.022
Former California coastal

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.957
commissioner when things we did

00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.026
find across the coast or across

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:41.627
the state.

00:07:41.694 --> 00:07:44.597
Was people valued the regulatory

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:46.532
scheme to protect access protect

00:07:46.599 --> 00:07:48.301
the beauty protect the ability

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.403
for people to feel that

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:51.504
ownership and be able to go to

00:07:51.571 --> 00:07:53.239
the coast and so.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.242
As we talk about coastal issues.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.011
We really are expanding beyond

00:07:59.078 --> 00:07:59.979
what just.

00:08:00.046 --> 00:08:01.848
The coastal jurisdictions thank

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.884
but it's very very much.

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:05.751
Eighty issue for the entire

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:06.052
[inaudible]

00:08:06.118 --> 00:08:08.688
Population California.

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.690
Right so our first panel will be

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:11.858
discussing effective on the

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:12.692
coast line.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:15.461
And we have UCSC professor mark

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.363
car and I want to thank you CSE

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.432
for hosting us today this is an

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:21.367
incredible facility and and a

00:08:21.434 --> 00:08:22.368
great resource.

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.436
We also have Amy will from from

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.238
the Monterey Bay aquarium and

00:08:25.304 --> 00:08:27.073
hollywire from the ocean

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:28.975
protection council and I will

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.176
note that the ocean protection

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:31.110
council be be.

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.780
Here tomorrow so dates a couple

00:08:34.847 --> 00:08:37.717
days of oceans issue.

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:39.952
Alright so professor Kerr thank

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:40.720
you -- Let

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:41.621
me start.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:42.788
Chair stone by thinking the

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.490
chairs as well as the committees

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.392
for the opportunity to to engage

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:47.627
in this discussion.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.328
Today.

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:51.297
When it came to identifying with

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.266
the panelists we're going to do --

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:55.234
I again picked the short straw I

00:08:55.301 --> 00:08:58.070
am the one who is going to

00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.438
describe the significance of the

00:08:59.505 --> 00:08:59.939
problem.

00:09:00.006 --> 00:09:01.340
And then all the people who

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:02.808
follow me are going to describe

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.943
how they're contributing to the

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.711
solution --

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:08.648
So I want to start my frame.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:09.916
And really the core of the

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.518
problem is the ever growing

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:13.686
amount of plastic that is

00:09:13.753 --> 00:09:15.454
produced in the world.

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:18.457
By demand of consumers and so

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:21.294
this graph shows the amount in

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.130
million tons of plastic that is

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:26.032
being generated globally over

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.000
time and I want to point out in

00:09:28.067 --> 00:09:28.968
this figure.

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:31.203
That by the year two thousand we

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.039
were producing about two hundred

00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:34.774
million times.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.842
By twenty ten ten years later we

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.779
are up to three hundred million.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:41.580
In only five years later we're

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.582
up at four hundred million tons

00:09:43.649 --> 00:09:44.550
per year --

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.686
So it's not just that there's so

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:48.654
much it's the fact that we're

00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:50.389
producing in more and more at an

00:09:50.456 --> 00:09:52.224
ever growing rate.

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.493
And so of course with all that

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.128
production.

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:57.997
It we end up with debris

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.298
material that that gets

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:02.001
discarded in various ways and I

00:10:02.068 --> 00:10:03.803
want to point out in this figure

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:04.003
that.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.772
Those the major producers and

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:08.708
they're and also the major

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:11.610
sources of debris include Asian

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:16.415
comp countries like China and us

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:17.450
the United States of America.

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.352
Next slide please.

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.221
And so with all that waste the

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.190
to being generated --

00:10:24.256 --> 00:10:25.157
By these countries.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:28.027
Of the fader that material --

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.996
Varies between recycling and

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.897
other --

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:32.865
Consequences.

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.835
This graph shows that over time

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.803
the proportion that's actually

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.572
being recycled.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:43.442
Is growing right and so by

00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:45.444
twenty fifteen roughly 20% of

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.381
the waste that's being generated.

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.249
Is actually being recycled --

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:53.352
Another 25% or more gets

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.120
incinerated.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.255
But which is probably spooky in

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:58.024
its own right.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:01.961
But notice that roughly 60% of

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.796
the the plastic that's being

00:11:03.863 --> 00:11:06.699
produced is getting discarded

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.768
either in the landfills or other

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:12.505
fates -- And

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:14.473
I'm one of those fades is the

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.310
leader in coastal areas and so

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:21.213
this graph shows again those

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.248
countries.

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:25.084
That have the largest country of

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:28.921
coastal letter of plastic debris

00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:29.255
in the world.

00:11:29.321 --> 00:11:31.824
And noticed that the United

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.959
States is generating on the

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:37.930
order of two hundred and seventy

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.532
five thousand tons per year of

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.567
discarded plastic.

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:44.470
Waste on and this is.

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:46.338
Constrained to fifty kilometers

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.574
along the coast line so much at

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:52.144
that production is being --

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.146
Is being a weight that --

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.281
To to discarded on the coast

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:58.017
line -- And

00:11:58.084 --> 00:12:00.119
so the question is how does all

00:12:00.186 --> 00:12:02.855
this plastic get into the ocean

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:04.857
the vast vast majority of it

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:05.891
comes from the land.

00:12:05.958 --> 00:12:09.562
Roughly aid is 7280% of ocean

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.497
plastic debris.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.499
Comes from the land.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.368
The other --

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:20.172
2230% comes from ocean sources

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:21.574
about half of that importantly

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.375
comes from debris associated

00:12:23.442 --> 00:12:25.177
with fishing fishing lines

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:27.980
fishing that this is a big

00:12:28.047 --> 00:12:29.014
source of plastic debris.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:31.951
And then other --

00:12:32.017 --> 00:12:35.754
Ocean based sources as vessels.

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.656
But importantly.

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.725
It's the vast majority of it

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:42.595
comes from land and to important

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:44.563
conduits by which plastic debris

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.365
gets to the ocean.

00:12:46.432 --> 00:12:48.434
Is either through major river

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:51.337
systems as illustrated here with

00:12:51.403 --> 00:12:54.273
this graph this photo of the Los

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.041
Angeles river --

00:12:56.108 --> 00:12:58.077
That transports much of that

00:12:58.144 --> 00:12:59.178
cools the letter to the coast

00:12:59.245 --> 00:13:01.280
line -- The

00:13:01.347 --> 00:13:04.850
other this the smaller micro

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:07.753
plastics are also did cards

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.555
through waste water systems that

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:10.556
that -- That

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.624
are not treated --

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.659
Because of the size of the

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:14.560
material next.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.329
So what are the consequences of

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:20.266
all of these plastics that are --

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:22.234
Moved and transported into the

00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:25.070
ocean so there's five major sort

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:26.338
of categories of ecological

00:13:26.405 --> 00:13:29.275
consequences. One particularly

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:31.110
important consequences

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:31.944
entanglement --

00:13:32.011 --> 00:13:33.779
And this tends to occur

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:35.681
especially for large marine

00:13:35.748 --> 00:13:37.850
mammals --

00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:39.652
And see birds as illustrated in

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:41.554
these photos --

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.390
Much of that entanglement is is

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:46.392
material that's lots from

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:47.326
fishing.

00:13:47.393 --> 00:13:51.197
Again naps and lines next slide --

00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:53.098
But another major --

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.134
Consequence is that direct

00:13:55.201 --> 00:13:58.103
ingestion of plastics by a wide

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.972
variety of species.

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.975
And then one of the the two big

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.778
problems with all that ingestion.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.713
Is that it can a clue the

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.682
digestive track so that animals

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:12.451
can no longer properly digest

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.686
material passage through their

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:14.486
bodies.

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:16.522
And as a consequence they die

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:17.389
out right.

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:20.259
The other is that the material

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:22.194
may collect in their gods.

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:25.064
And it takes up space that would

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.165
otherwise be filled with

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:29.001
nutrient rich food material.

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.869
And as a consequence it greatly

00:14:30.936 --> 00:14:32.871
reduces the growth rate of

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:35.841
organisms which again alternate

00:14:35.908 --> 00:14:37.676
reduces their reproductive

00:14:37.743 --> 00:14:40.479
potential and increases their

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.481
likelihood of of Diane

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:42.781
[inaudible]

00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:45.384
Next slide --

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.453
Then there is the the problem of

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.455
contamination that was mentioned

00:14:49.521 --> 00:14:50.222
earlier.

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.324
In this is where the plastic

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:54.159
materials --

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.997
Actually our talks and toxicants --

00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:59.898
And contaminants for organisms

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:02.067
and I start with that image

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:04.703
there which is --

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.705
Shows a a survey of the country

00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:08.674
PC bees --

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.510
Impeached plastic pellets around

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:11.810
the world.

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:14.480
PC bees are are linked to

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:16.482
reproductive disorders increased

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:19.351
risk of disease altering hormone

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.287
levels in an organism and

00:15:21.353 --> 00:15:23.289
ultimately contributing directly

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.256
to death.

00:15:24.323 --> 00:15:27.126
And and noticed that the the

00:15:27.192 --> 00:15:30.095
concentrations globally tend to

00:15:30.162 --> 00:15:34.767
be well below a hundred PC bees --

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:35.034
Plastic --

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.803
Pallets per area but look at San

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.640
Francisco and Los Angeles as two

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.475
of the highest --

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:46.545
Areas of concentration of these

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.314
P. P. C..

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.183
P. skews me PCB laden pallets

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.153
that and that mostly and up on

00:15:54.219 --> 00:15:55.154
coastal beaches --

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.156
And importantly it's the

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:58.290
contaminants that are in the

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:00.993
plastics themselves but also

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.895
realize that plastics in here

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.730
other contaminants.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.765
And make those available --

00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:08.701
When they're to organisms when

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:11.670
they're ingested as well next

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.473
slide please --

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.841
In an annex or a and an example

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:16.575
of that specifically because

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:19.311
much of this stuff ends up on

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:20.245
beaches.

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.580
Is that it gets and consumed by

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.184
all the all organisms that live

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.987
within the the sandy beach area --

00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:31.824
Which in turn are the major pray

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:32.925
for many of the shore birds

00:16:32.991 --> 00:16:35.794
along the coast so this is the

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:37.763
primary means by which plastic

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.664
contaminants.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.533
Ultimately end up in birds like

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.569
the greater share water through

00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.337
those what are called truth

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:46.405
thick --

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:49.241
Interactions the consumption of

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.309
prey that are are on

00:16:50.376 --> 00:16:52.244
contaminated to start with.

00:16:52.311 --> 00:16:54.079
Next slide please.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:55.948
And then that leads to other

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:56.982
indirect consequences.

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.017
As this stuff accumulates on

00:16:59.084 --> 00:17:01.854
beaches like beach rack kelp

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.788
does as well.

00:17:02.855 --> 00:17:04.823
We go through --

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.792
Great efforts to remove it and

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.727
clean it from the beach but that

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.497
process itself actually disrupts

00:17:11.563 --> 00:17:12.531
that ecosystem.

00:17:12.598 --> 00:17:14.566
I mentioned all the organisms

00:17:14.633 --> 00:17:17.302
that live in those sandy beaches

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.504
and when we go through and

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.206
constantly just wrapped and

00:17:21.273 --> 00:17:22.341
removed --

00:17:22.408 --> 00:17:25.110
That that San we impact the

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:27.012
communities of organisms that

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.981
live in the sand which again are

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:32.818
wet those shore birds and other

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:33.752
species are dependent upon.

00:17:33.819 --> 00:17:34.920
And finally --

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.622
A really important --

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.691
Consequence of plastic is as

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.560
what is referred to of actor a

00:17:41.627 --> 00:17:44.430
transport factor of invasive

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.432
species and this is because that

00:17:46.498 --> 00:17:48.600
those plastics can move great

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:49.268
distances.

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.602
Clearly from one side of the

00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:55.107
Pacific as we've seen from --

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:56.975
Fukushima.

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.845
And as those plastics move they

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:02.848
get colonized by organisms they

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.883
transport those organisms to new

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.685
places.

00:18:06.752 --> 00:18:07.920
That naturally would not.

00:18:07.986 --> 00:18:10.556
Get to and as a consequence

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.458
there a means of transporting

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:15.360
invasive species which then can

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.329
alter communities at the

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.331
recipient --

00:18:19.398 --> 00:18:20.199
Ecosystems.

00:18:20.265 --> 00:18:23.168
So these are the the five

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:25.204
primary ways that these various

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.140
contaminants are all terrain --

00:18:28.207 --> 00:18:30.876
Population individual organisms

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:33.679
populations communities and

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:34.713
entire ecosystems.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.748
Through these different kinds of

00:18:36.815 --> 00:18:39.518
interactions.

00:18:39.585 --> 00:18:40.652
And I think that's it for me.

00:18:40.719 --> 00:18:43.789
Having been the Debbie Downer of

00:18:43.856 --> 00:18:44.456
the panel.

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:45.891
Great thank you and I think what

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.359
we'll do is have each.

00:18:47.426 --> 00:18:49.294
First on the panel presents and

00:18:49.361 --> 00:18:51.129
then open it up for questions

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:51.330
from.

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:52.331
Assembly member [inaudible]

00:18:52.397 --> 00:18:55.167
Great.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:57.236
Whether pulling up my slides my

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:58.370
name's Amy wohl from I'm from

00:18:58.437 --> 00:19:00.105
the Monterey Bay aquarium I do

00:19:00.172 --> 00:19:02.841
California ocean policy work

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:04.776
there at the aquarium or here.

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.678
In the bay in the world.

00:19:06.745 --> 00:19:18.290
And one moment please.

00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:20.225
Air I am so I am here today to

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:23.061
share with Monterey Bay aquarium

00:19:23.128 --> 00:19:24.196
has gotten involved to help

00:19:24.263 --> 00:19:25.230
reduce ocean plastic pollution

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:27.132
and to understand more about the

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.001
impact it's having on the health

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.869
of the ocean as well as our

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.004
fresh water wildlife and

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.805
ecosystems.

00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:34.840
The problem of plastic pollution

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.742
becomes more vivid every day as

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:37.843
a growing body of research is

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.711
revealing how ubiquitous plastic

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:41.513
has become in nature.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.748
And points to help businesses

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:44.550
usual approach means more and

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.451
more plastic will enter the

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:47.319
environment in years to come.

00:19:47.386 --> 00:19:49.321
On the positive side of this

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.223
issue is solvable.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.257
And as attention on it grows so

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:54.192
does innovation in the public

00:19:54.259 --> 00:19:55.260
and private sector to move us to

00:19:55.327 --> 00:19:58.063
new more sustainable directions.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.798
Many of you have likely seen

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.900
images of plastic soups like

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.702
this one an even more disturbing

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:05.737
photos of marine animals.

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:06.672
I won't show days today but

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.640
images like these have captured

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:10.609
the public attention and started

00:20:10.676 --> 00:20:12.644
a global movement to prevent

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:13.245
plastic pollution [inaudible]

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.380
Next slide.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:17.282
This issue.

00:20:17.349 --> 00:20:18.317
Has definitely captured the

00:20:18.383 --> 00:20:20.252
attention of our visitors based

00:20:20.319 --> 00:20:22.521
on a two thousand eighteen

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:24.056
survey over half of our visitors

00:20:24.122 --> 00:20:25.190
view plastic pollution is the

00:20:25.257 --> 00:20:26.959
biggest threat to ocean health

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:28.260
and see taking action on this

00:20:28.327 --> 00:20:30.128
issue is a key key way to help

00:20:30.195 --> 00:20:31.930
the ocean.

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:32.764
There are also been statewide

00:20:32.831 --> 00:20:34.733
surveys of California voters on

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.934
this issue that showed that a

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.569
majority of them are concerned

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:38.904
about the impacts of plastic

00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:40.505
pollution.

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.506
On our beaches and waterways.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.709
In fact a majority vote voters

00:20:43.775 --> 00:20:45.544
here in California res rejected

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:47.446
a ballot proposal to appeal

00:20:47.512 --> 00:20:49.281
California's first in the nation

00:20:49.348 --> 00:20:51.216
statewide plastic bag law.

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:53.085
And we also saw the passage of

00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:54.553
AB eighteen eighty four straws

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:56.021
on request.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:57.022
Next slide.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:58.123
Media outlets like National

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.959
Geographic can the sciences

00:21:01.026 --> 00:21:02.894
story of plastic pollution front

00:21:02.961 --> 00:21:04.730
and center in the public eye.

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:07.599
Grassroots an NGO led campaigns

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:08.734
on the issue continue to

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.669
proliferate and now there are

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:11.870
signs that heightened awareness

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:13.639
by the public many of whom are

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:15.474
consumers of plastic is

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.576
inspiring change from the local

00:21:17.643 --> 00:21:18.343
to global level.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.345
Next slide.

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:21.213
And what impact does all this

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.280
plastic pollution having on

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:24.049
marine life.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.050
Next slide.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:26.918
Scientists report that there's

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.186
been an increase in the number

00:21:28.253 --> 00:21:29.821
of incidences between plastic

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:31.823
and marine animals either by

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.825
entanglement or ingestion as we

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:35.694
just heard from professor car.

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:36.194
That sometimes leads to

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:38.063
mortality otherwise known as

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:38.597
death.

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.465
Nearly seven hundred marines

00:21:40.532 --> 00:21:41.867
beaches have been impacted by

00:21:41.933 --> 00:21:44.369
plastic over half of all

00:21:44.436 --> 00:21:45.470
individual sea turtles have

00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:46.471
ingested plastic.

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:49.307
And it's estimated that by.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:50.308
Twenty twenty five or twenty

00:21:50.375 --> 00:21:53.078
fifty excuse me 95% of all sea

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:54.112
birds live in just a plastic.

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:56.048
Plastic is also affected at

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:57.983
least twenty six species of

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:59.951
cetaceans including the pilot

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.853
well found struggling to swim in

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.855
a tie can now this past June.

00:22:03.922 --> 00:22:05.691
Any Cropsey animal autopsy

00:22:05.757 --> 00:22:07.759
showed that it had seventeen

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:09.494
pounds of plastic and stomach

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:10.629
that made it impossible for the

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:12.431
well to ingest food.

00:22:12.497 --> 00:22:13.598
An important area of future

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:15.300
researches help plastic impacts

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:17.302
these animals at the population

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:17.536
level.

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.337
Both today and into the future

00:22:19.404 --> 00:22:20.305
as the volume of plastic

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:22.140
pollution grows.

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:24.009
Another attribute of most

00:22:24.076 --> 00:22:26.178
plastic that is problematic or

00:22:26.244 --> 00:22:27.946
next yep thank you.

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:29.081
The another attribute of most

00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:30.882
plastic that is problematic for

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:31.983
the environment is that it does

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:33.719
not biodegrade under natural

00:22:33.785 --> 00:22:34.753
conditions.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.854
They can break down into smaller

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:37.789
and smaller pieces particles

00:22:37.856 --> 00:22:39.591
less than five millimeters in

00:22:39.658 --> 00:22:40.992
size or referred to as Michael

00:22:41.059 --> 00:22:41.460
plastic.

00:22:41.526 --> 00:22:42.861
Other types of Michael plastic

00:22:42.928 --> 00:22:46.431
like micro national waste

00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:48.333
management devices and flow into

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.169
the water waste and land.

00:22:51.236 --> 00:22:52.337
Recent studies demonstrate that

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:54.039
were only beginning to scratch

00:22:54.106 --> 00:22:55.373
the surface of the prevalence of

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.242
Michael plastic in the ocean and

00:22:57.309 --> 00:22:57.876
its impact.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.978
We know that it can spread

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:00.879
throughout the water column.

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:02.814
From service to see floor and

00:23:02.881 --> 00:23:04.082
that organisms as small as

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.916
plankton can ingest Michael

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:06.718
plastic before being eaten by

00:23:06.785 --> 00:23:08.854
fish and other animals higher up

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.488
the food chain.

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.656
We want to learn more about this

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:13.391
bioaccumulation of fact

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:14.459
especially considering the

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:15.527
plastic can contain toxic

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:17.462
chemicals that may be absorbed

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:18.563
into the tissues of marine

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.232
organisms.

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:21.366
There's a lot we still have to

00:23:21.433 --> 00:23:23.101
learn about these processes and

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.003
so far many in the scientific

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.303
community.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:26.972
Said the plastic in seafood for

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.940
example does not yet pose a

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.842
significant risk to human health.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.811
The more plastic that enters the

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:33.779
ocean food web though the

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:34.913
greater the urgency for

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.881
answering these types of

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:38.717
important questions.

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.018
So what is the solution to the

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.520
growing passed a pollution

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:43.722
problem if there's anything

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:44.856
positive to say about such a

00:23:44.923 --> 00:23:47.325
broad and complex challenges

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:48.260
that there are lots of actions.

00:23:48.326 --> 00:23:50.128
Each of us can take to close the

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:52.130
gap between protect production

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.132
of plastic and recovery of it.

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:56.134
And stem the flow of plastic

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:56.968
into our ocean.

00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:59.304
The two over arching solutions

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:01.840
the solutions strategies that in

00:24:01.907 --> 00:24:03.742
for my work at the aquarium our

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:04.676
first.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.645
We have to turn down the Tanpa

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:07.579
we deal with the mass.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:08.747
This means we need to address

00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:09.915
source reduction at the same

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:11.449
time is we would prove waste

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:12.784
management especially in the

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.353
countries that are quote leaking

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.288
the most plastic into the ocean.

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:18.356
Number two now is a great time

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:19.491
to innovate ways we can move

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.226
from a linear lifecycle for

00:24:21.293 --> 00:24:22.093
plastic.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.062
The one to one that keeps the

00:24:24.129 --> 00:24:26.031
plastic we need the most in use

00:24:26.097 --> 00:24:26.998
for as long as possible.

00:24:27.065 --> 00:24:28.233
On living away from unnecessary

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.802
single use.

00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:33.672
Monterey Bay aquarium is leading

00:24:33.738 --> 00:24:34.873
a consortium of twenty two

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.941
aquariums across the United

00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:36.942
States brought together to

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.476
increase our collective impact

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:40.512
on ocean conservation.

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:41.680
The partnership is adopted

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:43.381
plastic pollution as its primary

00:24:43.448 --> 00:24:45.483
goal and last year all members

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.185
aquariums pledge to live

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:48.420
immediately eliminate all

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:49.554
plastic straws for my food

00:24:49.621 --> 00:24:50.121
service.

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.290
And take away bags from our gift

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:55.026
shops and significantly reduce

00:24:55.093 --> 00:24:57.095
or eliminate plastic beverage

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:57.963
bottles by.

00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:58.997
Twenty twenty Monterey Bay

00:24:59.064 --> 00:25:00.232
aquarium has already phase that

00:25:00.298 --> 00:25:01.733
are single use bottles along

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.735
with other single use plastic

00:25:03.802 --> 00:25:04.736
items in our front of the house

00:25:04.803 --> 00:25:06.671
food service operations.

00:25:06.738 --> 00:25:07.639
Were also working with their

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.541
food and retail service provider

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:10.809
to reduce single use plastic in

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.477
our gift store.

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:13.511
We know this is an easy and

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.413
that's why we are champion of

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.382
business and government working

00:25:17.449 --> 00:25:19.184
to make incremental change.

00:25:19.251 --> 00:25:21.253
In the right direction we hope

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:22.254
the more committed we are to

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.055
change the more new and

00:25:24.122 --> 00:25:25.957
innovative solutions will emerge

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:27.125
to solve the problem of ocean

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:28.894
plastic pollution for good.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.262
Thank you for the opportunity to

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:32.797
speak with you today.

00:25:32.864 --> 00:25:33.064
Thank you.

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:36.701
These.

00:25:36.768 --> 00:25:37.802
Good morning thank you for

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:40.538
having me here today --

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:41.473
I'm all the wire and the marine

00:25:41.539 --> 00:25:43.375
pollution program manager at the

00:25:43.441 --> 00:25:44.376
California ocean protection

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:45.343
council --

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.279
And as the finder coming up I

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:49.314
just to provide you got to the

00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:50.248
brief background on who the

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:52.083
agent protection council is --

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:53.351
What we are a state agency this

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:54.352
sort of nested within the

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.154
natural resources agency --

00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:57.889
And we work to protect the ocean

00:25:57.956 --> 00:25:58.356
for current and future

00:25:58.423 --> 00:25:59.858
generations --

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.694
We working for me in ways we

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.729
recommend and implement policy.

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:05.597
Abby leading promote

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:06.598
coordination among state

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:07.532
agencies.

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.936
Mistaken leverage funding for

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:13.571
research and making with the

00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:15.373
best available science.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.675
The OPC has been working on

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.311
plastic pollution since --

00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:19.878
Two thousand seven and today

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.279
I'll be talking about some of

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:21.846
our more recent work on the

00:26:21.913 --> 00:26:25.116
issue --

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:25.750
Before I died into what we see

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:27.052
is been doing I know we've heard

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:28.853
a lot about ecological impact of

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.188
plastic and I wanted to briefly

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.924
mention the economic impact of

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.727
plastic the California --

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:36.561
Into twenty fifteen California

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:37.929
communities were spending more

00:26:37.996 --> 00:26:39.064
than four hundred twenty eight

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:40.832
million per year to clean up and

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:42.367
control letter --

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.668
And in addition to that a lot of

00:26:43.735 --> 00:26:44.769
the litter cleanups are done

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:46.538
using volunteers which cost them

00:26:46.604 --> 00:26:48.340
their time --

00:26:48.406 --> 00:26:49.374
In the volunteer service --

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:51.076
The California adopt a highway

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.144
participants is estimated at

00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.013
eighteen million annually.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.414
Enjoy this cost the state a lot

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.950
of money --

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:00.986
So how are we going about

00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:01.886
addressing this issue.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:03.922
A and I'm going to cover if you

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:06.658
policy initiatives today and the

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:07.225
first is a twenty eighteen

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.493
notion that our strategy and

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.694
then I'll take a few minutes to

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:11.596
talk about the trash amendments

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:13.431
and packaging reform.

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:15.300
Other twenty eighteen session

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:16.434
letter strategy outlines OPC

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.469
priorities and stakeholder

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.104
actions to address social

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:20.271
lettering California over the

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:26.911
next six years --

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.380
And I just one other plastic

00:27:28.446 --> 00:27:29.914
pollution of the multi faceted

00:27:29.981 --> 00:27:30.882
problems of the strategy include

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.851
action that a really wide

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.652
variety of skills and scopes --

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:36.721
Essentially because no one

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:37.789
solution is really going to just

00:27:37.856 --> 00:27:38.990
be the silver bullet that's all

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:40.458
all of this --

00:27:40.525 --> 00:27:41.026
So we want to include a wide

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:45.530
range of which and annex side

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:47.298
please.

00:27:47.365 --> 00:27:48.233
Overall the strategy has

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:51.169
prioritized source reduction as

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:51.736
the most effective and least

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:52.103
costly.

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.371
Costly method to reduce plastic

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:55.006
pollution.

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:56.274
And we define this as practices

00:27:56.341 --> 00:27:57.942
that reduce the amount of

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:58.877
materials entering the waste

00:27:58.943 --> 00:28:00.845
stream am including changes in

00:28:00.912 --> 00:28:02.680
the design manufacture or a

00:28:02.747 --> 00:28:04.883
purchase or use of materials.

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:06.618
Next slide please.

00:28:06.684 --> 00:28:07.652
Organizations can engage in

00:28:07.719 --> 00:28:09.487
source reduction at multiple

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.555
points in the product life cycle --

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:12.390
Including making changes in the

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.359
design institutional purchasing --

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:16.294
And distribution of items that

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:16.795
commonly become plastic

00:28:16.861 --> 00:28:18.263
pollution --

00:28:18.329 --> 00:28:19.397
In addition to this when you're

00:28:19.464 --> 00:28:22.000
sort of decision points model --

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:22.667
Governments can also make broad

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.102
changes to waste management that

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.271
encourage source reduction on a

00:28:26.337 --> 00:28:26.938
large scale.

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:28.440
And for example implementing

00:28:28.506 --> 00:28:29.874
policies that will produce or to

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:31.709
responsible for the end of life

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:32.710
management --

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:34.612
And disposal ideally recycling

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:37.749
or reuse of their products next

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:40.452
by please.

00:28:40.518 --> 00:28:41.820
As part of the initial letter

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:44.322
strategy the OPC is developed as

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:44.889
priorities to address social

00:28:44.956 --> 00:28:47.225
letter --

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:47.892
And today it I've we have three

00:28:47.959 --> 00:28:49.294
categories listed out here --

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:49.894
In today and really just going

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.196
to focus on the first one of

00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:52.063
land based sources division

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.297
letter.

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:54.299
This means --

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:57.001
Product to be calmly find that's

00:28:57.068 --> 00:29:01.773
rappers that sort of thing --

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.740
The uppity has identified --

00:29:02.807 --> 00:29:03.875
Number priority actions to

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.810
address this and I can't go

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:06.744
through all of them but a few of

00:29:06.811 --> 00:29:07.712
them include permitting changes

00:29:07.779 --> 00:29:09.047
and state purchasing and service

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.482
contracts to get combination

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:11.449
letter items --

00:29:11.516 --> 00:29:14.886
Out of the dining facilities and

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:17.255
state buildings --

00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:17.856
Promoting comprehensive waste

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:19.190
management approaches to prevent

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:20.525
the production of combination

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.292
letter items through cal

00:29:21.359 --> 00:29:22.393
recycles packaging reform

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.028
efforts.

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.897
On and supporting policies that

00:29:25.964 --> 00:29:26.464
reduce expanded polystyrene

00:29:26.531 --> 00:29:28.800
letter --

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:29.968
Such as a provision in single

00:29:30.034 --> 00:29:30.969
use food service where --

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.770
Or including inclusion of

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:34.606
expanded polystyrene in college

00:29:34.672 --> 00:29:35.640
like of packaging reform efforts.

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:37.509
Under to provide a little bit

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:38.710
more background on this OPC

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:40.478
included --

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:41.579
Expanded polystyrene began in

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:43.715
our two two thousand eight

00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:44.349
letters prodigy.

00:29:44.415 --> 00:29:47.352
And we've included in the twenty

00:29:47.418 --> 00:29:47.852
eight to twenty eighteen

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:49.187
document for a few reasons --

00:29:49.254 --> 00:29:50.388
The first is that when expanded

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.289
polystyrene gets into

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:52.257
environment it breaks into

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.192
little pieces very quickly --

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:55.994
And it often mixes into sand and

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.995
sediments that's very hard to

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:57.962
clean up.

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:02.800
And in its use as part of and

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:05.537
recyclable you can technically

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:06.538
recycled perfectly clean

00:30:06.604 --> 00:30:08.706
polystyrene phone but once it's

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:09.641
contaminated food you really

00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:11.509
just have to go and felt --

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:12.343
So that's part of why we're

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.746
continuing to prioritize if a

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:16.281
policy action.

00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:19.217
Annex I please --

00:30:19.284 --> 00:30:21.052
As I mentioned there's not a

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:22.253
company there is in the silver

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.388
bullet to address the issue of

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.056
plastic pollution --

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.057
So we're taking comprehensive

00:30:26.124 --> 00:30:27.959
approach and working with --

00:30:28.026 --> 00:30:29.894
Other state agencies I'm going

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:31.029
to briefly touch on a couple of

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:31.863
different policies that the

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.132
state's working on and how we're

00:30:34.199 --> 00:30:34.632
working with them.

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:36.901
And the first I'd like to talk

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:37.702
about is the trash amendments

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.604
and these are amendments that

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:41.439
prohibits storm water systems.

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:42.540
From just charging trash larger

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:44.375
than by millimeters to waters of

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:45.343
the state.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:46.678
On the trusted amendments were

00:30:46.744 --> 00:30:47.412
adopted by the state water board

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:49.113
in twenty fifteen and we're now

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.448
in the early stages of

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:52.016
implementation --

00:30:52.083 --> 00:30:53.017
And as part of that local

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.385
governments are deciding how to

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:56.287
comply. One thing the truck

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.822
commitment has done is is that

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.123
is taken the costs associated

00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.857
with uncontrolled.

00:30:59.924 --> 00:31:01.960
Uncontrolled trash and has made

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:03.628
that explicit --

00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:04.629
So local government are having

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.763
to pay for a full capture system

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:06.931
to catch this trash or they're

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:07.966
having to pay for a number of

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:09.701
other measures that would be

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:11.736
equivalent installing a full

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:12.370
capture system.

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:13.538
We're interested in how the

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:14.772
action the policies recommended

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:15.640
in the letter strategy could

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:17.242
potentially help to bring those

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:19.210
costs to local governments down --

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:21.045
For example if a local

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.313
government fan something like

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.948
expanded polystyrene they no

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.216
longer have to worry about

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:26.150
cleaning it out of there

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.019
catchments and there are

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:31.889
starving systems --

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:32.890
In addition to this we a PC is

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.692
also committed to exploring a

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:36.561
priority action of on looking at

00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:38.529
methods for producers and the

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:40.465
public to share responsibility

00:31:40.531 --> 00:31:41.666
to fund the cleanup of beaches

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.700
in a lot of ways that are

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:44.402
polluted with.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:44.936
Different types of plastic

00:31:45.003 --> 00:31:49.741
products --

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:51.509
So now I'm going to move to

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.244
packaging form of this is an

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:54.078
effort that is currently being

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.146
undertaken by cover cycle to

00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:57.015
develop recommendations for how

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:57.982
the state.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:58.783
Should proceed with a mandatory

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.051
approach to decrease the

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.686
generation of packaging waste

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:03.755
and I'm and increase packaging

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.690
reuse recycling and composting --

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:06.991
This will include pretty sure

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:08.526
taking increased responsibility

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:09.060
for the end of life their

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:10.461
packaging.

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:12.330
A part of like our cycles taking

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:13.398
this on is that California has

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.699
that some very aggressive waste

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:15.366
diversion goals.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.268
And packaging makes up about a

00:32:17.335 --> 00:32:18.403
quarter of the way streaming

00:32:18.469 --> 00:32:20.338
California which is why it's a

00:32:20.405 --> 00:32:21.472
priority for cover cycle to

00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:23.074
address.

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.942
Most of the items that are

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:26.144
commonly found as plastic

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.845
pollution fall under this broad

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:28.913
category of packaging the cover

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.884
cycle is looking at I'm in the

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:33.885
stakeholders at we worked with

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:34.652
on the letter strategy are

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:35.553
really interested in using

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.821
packaging reform to promote and

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.456
achieve more comprehensive

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:38.856
source reduction.

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:40.525
Of plastic pollution --

00:32:40.591 --> 00:32:42.427
As part of the strategy OPC is

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:44.429
committed to finding a report

00:32:44.495 --> 00:32:45.263
that would synthesize lessons

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.264
learned from waste management

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.265
policies and tools and other

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.232
countries --

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:50.068
It and develop recommendations

00:32:50.134 --> 00:32:51.969
for California with a focus on

00:32:52.036 --> 00:32:53.971
how to use those policies

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:56.941
policies for source reduction --

00:32:57.008 --> 00:32:58.810
The annex I please.

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.011
Taken cleared I just like to add

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.679
that we're at the beginning of

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:02.246
the strategy implementation

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:03.681
process --

00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:06.718
And that its intended to six

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:08.853
years and we're excited to move

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.589
the city forward [inaudible]

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:13.324
Great.

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:16.194
Thank you all so much --

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.462
Just kind of a start of

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:19.364
questions and the next panel is

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.099
going to look a little bit more

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:22.100
at some of the details a bit

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:25.002
more locally but okay OPC even

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:26.137
those California based of the

00:33:26.204 --> 00:33:27.872
seas done a very good job of

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:29.006
building some linkages.

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:31.008
Internationally on issues that

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:31.909
you're familiar with the

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.745
aquarium of course is an

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:35.613
international organization and

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.581
sits between.

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:38.850
In a lot of ways government and

00:33:38.916 --> 00:33:40.451
industry since governments

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.353
regulating industry producing

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.521
the aquarium as a non

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:45.256
governmental organization I

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:45.890
think is a tremendous amount of

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:46.557
influence it has done a lot

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:48.359
around the world.

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:49.193
And then of course.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.063
Our university system as

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.198
represented here by professor

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:54.999
car.

00:33:55.066 --> 00:33:57.034
Doing a lot of research and sort

00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:58.870
of looking globally I've I

00:33:58.936 --> 00:33:59.504
looked at the slides that you

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:00.772
had Dr Kerr this is a question

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:01.706
actually.

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:03.775
For for any of you.

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:06.611
And some of the other.

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.646
Data that I've shown is that yes

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.381
the US produces a lot of plastic

00:34:10.448 --> 00:34:12.450
China there some sources of

00:34:12.517 --> 00:34:13.317
plastic.

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:14.419
But if you look at the rivers

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:16.254
that are the major conduits for

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.321
plastics a lot of those are in

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.223
Southeast Asia.

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.125
South America and other places.

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:23.995
Sealed my question is so what

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:24.996
for for us of California does

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:27.131
plastic policy are we really

00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:28.833
going to have.

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.835
That big of an impact on the

00:34:30.902 --> 00:34:33.838
amount of plastics that into the

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.540
ocean.

00:34:35.606 --> 00:34:37.508
So I'll I'll take the first shot

00:34:37.575 --> 00:34:38.643
at responding to that. To the

00:34:38.709 --> 00:34:39.477
work that is --

00:34:39.544 --> 00:34:41.312
Looked at the at the

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:43.448
distribution of that of marine

00:34:43.514 --> 00:34:44.415
debris.

00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:44.949
Has shown that it's very

00:34:45.016 --> 00:34:49.120
strongly where it's produced --

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:51.055
And so so.

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:53.124
While we may not affect the

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:55.993
production of marine debris

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.829
generated by China --

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:59.864
If we reduce them right amount

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:00.865
of marine debris that's

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:02.633
generated in the United States

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.569
that'll have a direct impact.

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.672
On marine debris here and a

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:08.673
bright because it's it's being

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:12.376
restricted. To those areas where

00:35:12.443 --> 00:35:14.312
it's it's largely generated.

00:35:14.378 --> 00:35:15.346
The other --

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:17.181
Evidence of that is it if you

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.382
look across all the basins the

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:21.118
ocean basins around the world.

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:23.988
The ocean basin that by far has

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:24.889
the greatest amount of marine

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.891
debris is the north Pacific

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.026
because it's it lies between

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:31.696
China and the United States so

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:34.599
that combined production and

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:37.568
disposal of of waste material by

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:38.536
our two countries.

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:41.405
Have led to the greatest

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.341
concentrate globally.

00:35:43.407 --> 00:35:47.378
In an offer because thank you

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:50.014
other comes from palace

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:50.314
[inaudible]

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:53.050
Yeah.

00:35:53.117 --> 00:35:56.020
Hang on what we can.

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:58.856
Still instrument.

00:35:58.923 --> 00:35:59.156
Embodying.

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.826
McCarty I mean that that was I

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:02.393
will admit that was a loaded

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.730
question [inaudible]

00:36:05.796 --> 00:36:09.734
Okay okay I recommend that we

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.337
focus on these issues from the

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.373
whole state of California is the

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.274
ocean especially areas where I

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:21.078
represent Sacramento we have.

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.981
Freaks the stranger have.

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:25.116
Annual cleanups there we could

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:27.919
see it first hand W. said how

00:36:27.985 --> 00:36:29.186
how the plastic that gets into

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:31.956
the ocean is mainly land base as

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.592
opposed to marines apart.

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.628
So that from letter or mistakes

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:39.363
people not discarding their

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.432
their their recycles properly or

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:42.733
maybe they do and it just falls

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.435
off the trash truck and go so

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.337
how does it.

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.204
How does it?

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:51.409
In a picture of how it all goes

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.010
sideways.

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:55.079
I think it's it's very difficult

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:56.247
to pinpoint about level whether

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:57.248
someone that actually just

00:36:57.315 --> 00:36:58.149
intentionally through it on the

00:36:58.215 --> 00:37:00.051
ground versus someone to put it

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:00.918
in the trash can and then it

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:01.986
fell out of the trash can lid

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:02.653
being picked up and put into a

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.622
truck or something --

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:05.823
That level of detail is hard to

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.426
pin down --

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.695
But I think it's characterizing

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.496
all of as intentional littering

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.398
really isn't accurate a lot of

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:16.300
the things that we find the call

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:16.901
to clean up their relatively

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:17.168
small.

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:19.036
They're easy to lose track of

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:21.138
and so I don't think that

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:22.974
intentional littering is.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.976
The bulk of the problem.

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.844
But to reinforce whether

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:29.780
intentional or not it is letter.

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.082
And that is the primary source

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:31.682
of this.

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:33.751
Material that ends up.

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:36.520
In the fresh water systems in --

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:38.522
Systems and then ultimately is

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.724
transported to the ocean.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:40.791
Getting at some point is that

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.260
we're doing a great job

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:45.329
recycling trying their best but

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:47.365
you know it happens right makes

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:49.100
up and stuff.

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.968
Fall through the cracks the

00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:52.103
winning that struck me to the

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:52.303
show.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.138
The amount of recycling maybe

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:57.775
where the percentage of product

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:58.809
is that we're recycling.

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.745
Is significant but the amount of

00:38:00.811 --> 00:38:02.146
volume so much greater than it

00:38:02.213 --> 00:38:03.714
was twenty years ago exactly

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:05.016
that and then maybe while we

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:06.484
increase recycling participation

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.387
by. 70% last twenty years would

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.621
be look at the actual piece

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.324
right in that.

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:15.192
In the water ways it's it's

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.094
worse than decades ago right so

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.262
what are some of the what are

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:19.563
some of the and we'll get to

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:21.198
this next but from your

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.933
perspective. Three what are some

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.335
of the potential remedies that

00:38:24.402 --> 00:38:26.037
we see in.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.905
States jurisdictions across the

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:28.773
globe.

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:29.073
They can --

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.775
They can address this.

00:38:30.841 --> 00:38:33.711
So all start and then you two

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:34.345
can certainly take off on this

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:37.548
but as both of of panelists

00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:40.518
emphasized its the source it's

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.385
the production of the material.

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:44.255
Right that if if there is a way

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:47.158
to curb the amount of plastic

00:38:47.224 --> 00:38:49.226
material that we consume that we

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.962
use then that will be the most

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:54.098
significant way to reduce the

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.900
amount of material that.

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:56.901
Ends up in the ocean.

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.770
And by far that's it's going

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:00.805
right at the source of the

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:02.740
problem that is probably the

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:05.576
strongest solution --

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:07.545
And then the other activities of

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.814
of the amount of recycling like

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.283
you said the amount of recycling

00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:13.284
we do --

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.519
Efforts to manage that material

00:39:15.586 --> 00:39:16.253
better --

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.256
Those will help but yeah and

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:21.992
it's all a function of just how

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.127
much of this stuff we're having

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:24.895
to cope with it unit that's easy

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.797
to say but what what does that

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.899
mean in practical terms for a

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:29.900
family [inaudible]

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:32.636
Our family.

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:34.038
Not might be my wife for two

00:39:34.105 --> 00:39:34.538
little girls [inaudible]

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:35.539
By.

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:39.443
You know food and products.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:41.445
To you no washer closer laundry

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:43.314
and so forth so we're buying

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.415
just consumption of stock.

00:39:44.482 --> 00:39:46.317
Does it is it choices that we're

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.551
making the things differently or

00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:48.152
is it.

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.187
Requiring manufacture things

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.422
differently regarding to produce

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:52.957
you know biodegradable

00:39:53.023 --> 00:39:54.959
containers that are so aye based

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:55.326
don't nine what.

00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:56.894
What are the?

00:39:56.961 --> 00:40:00.698
Are the best solution.

00:40:00.765 --> 00:40:02.700
It I think it's gonna there's a

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:03.300
lot of different ways we got

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:05.569
into the problem with plastic

00:40:05.636 --> 00:40:06.804
being around everything that we

00:40:06.871 --> 00:40:07.772
use so I think there's a lot of

00:40:07.838 --> 00:40:08.873
families were going to get out

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:10.407
of it so it is.

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:11.442
It is both --

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.310
Consumers.

00:40:13.377 --> 00:40:15.279
Making the choices with their

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:16.180
pocketbooks with their wallets

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.515
and deciding what they're going

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.250
to buy which will send a signal

00:40:19.316 --> 00:40:21.152
to the market that we we don't

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.987
want everything wrapped in

00:40:23.053 --> 00:40:24.121
single use plastic all the time

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:25.923
it's also.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.891
Things like the legislation that

00:40:26.957 --> 00:40:29.827
we've just passed around single

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:31.762
reducing the use of straws as

00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:33.597
well as requiring that packaging

00:40:33.664 --> 00:40:35.533
be either recycling.

00:40:35.599 --> 00:40:36.567
Recyclable are composed ball as

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:39.403
state facilities so there are

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:40.704
different ways and I think that

00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.340
we Ana on a more global.

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:45.609
Macro level of looking at our

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:49.013
markets we to our businesses

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:51.015
that we need some different

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:52.917
choices there's not a a as Holly

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.084
said a silver bullet right now

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:54.852
there's not it.

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:57.888
No one's invented --

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:00.024
A new kind of less problematic

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.561
plastic just yet however.

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:05.863
We can work towards those types

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.465
of solutions.

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.334
I just wanted to add that on

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.303
there is I think a role for

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:14.471
packaging redesign and source

00:41:14.538 --> 00:41:16.173
reduction a lot of what we find

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:16.740
and beaches are things like

00:41:16.807 --> 00:41:18.309
bottle caps --

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:22.046
And if you can attach caps the

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:23.948
bottle so that you don't end up

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:26.016
having this lease cap on to you

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:26.917
you know twisted off your model.

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:29.720
It's a great way.

00:41:29.787 --> 00:41:30.888
To prevent that from getting was

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.656
in the environment --

00:41:32.723 --> 00:41:34.592
I know Assemblymember's down as

00:41:34.658 --> 00:41:35.192
authored some bills are not in

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:40.598
the past [inaudible]

00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:42.333
The Friedman.

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.368
I have two questions the first

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.270
is --

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:49.206
Regulatory when an American ship

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:52.009
or California ship were voter

00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:54.011
any vessel goes to see. To we

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:56.013
have control over it regulatory

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.148
relief once it gets outside of

00:41:58.215 --> 00:42:00.751
U. S. waters.

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:01.919
Or they just can do whatever

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:03.621
they want because they're no

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.655
longer in U. S. waters to use

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:06.991
you and if you don't know that's

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:08.459
fine we can find out.

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:11.362
Anybody now I do not no I I

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:14.365
unfortunately do not know ninety

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:17.434
my account of that's something

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:18.235
I'm curious about.

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:19.370
And secondly I'm wondering if

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:20.204
any of you know of any analysis

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:22.206
of cost I'm thinking about

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:23.173
beverage bottles particularly

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.842
beverage containers of cost

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:26.877
between glass and plastic.

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.746
And how that analysis breaks

00:42:28.812 --> 00:42:30.014
down you know including

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.649
transportation and everything

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:32.683
else that.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:33.684
The manufacturer the the

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:37.454
bottlers have or have any data

00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.690
that's nobody did I don't expect

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:40.557
it answer the question right now.

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:41.558
But you know of any data that's

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:44.361
available on that.

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:45.296
You know I don't know whether

00:42:45.362 --> 00:42:46.397
that's been there's been

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:48.132
analyses for then I suspect the

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:50.100
next panel members.

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.102
May be able to respond to that

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:56.807
better actually okay and TM.

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:59.710
What is that?

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:00.878
The couple repairers ships are

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.613
US flag there is some

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.948
jurisdiction over a shift that

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:05.616
is in international waters that

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:07.518
is moving to the United States

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.620
ships that are not US flag there

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:11.322
is no guard little or no

00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:12.423
jurisdiction.

00:43:12.489 --> 00:43:14.325
So if there's an accident or a

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:16.260
dumping of classics very little

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:18.162
we can do about it.

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:20.030
If that ship is on its way into

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:21.966
US port there might be.

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:23.000
More that can happen but once it

00:43:23.067 --> 00:43:24.902
to U. S. B. ship to they have to

00:43:24.969 --> 00:43:26.837
follow our rules even if they're

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:27.972
in international waters it yes

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:28.772
of its US flag.

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:31.642
It is but most of the commerce

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:37.448
is with ships that are not US

00:43:37.514 --> 00:43:37.748
[inaudible]

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:39.383
Five this car.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.651
Thank you for the quick

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.252
questions --

00:43:42.319 --> 00:43:43.554
To the you know by I think a lot

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.155
of this has to do both market

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:48.058
based upon demand it also --

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.126
Dave your change --

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:51.962
Regulation can for some of that

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:53.230
and I was very product number

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.431
and found that it was on the

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:55.766
council we're the first big city

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:56.000
to ban.

00:43:56.066 --> 00:43:57.101
Single use plastic of all for

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:59.670
all retail --

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:02.573
And we saw the results of that

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:03.640
the band --

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:05.542
Polystyrene for take out --

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:06.577
The restaurants adapted very

00:44:06.643 --> 00:44:08.612
quickly and customers

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:10.381
appreciated it --

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:13.317
And so.

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.219
In that same vein.

00:44:15.285 --> 00:44:18.155
What as as we look at the

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.124
regulatory side of a what of how

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.092
we can force the issue?

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.127
Because of the scale and the

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.294
scope of the problem I think is

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.229
waiting and waiting for a market

00:44:25.295 --> 00:44:26.797
based solution --

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.065
Isn't good enough --

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:29.733
End.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.602
Waiting just for individual

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:32.903
behavior change when people are

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.505
making consumer families witness

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:35.539
who decisions.

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.673
Yeah they might want to try to

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:37.641
do the right thing as much as

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.675
they can but and the day.

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:40.411
They they have a limitation on

00:44:40.477 --> 00:44:42.346
how much they can pay for things

00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:45.182
and it the costs are skewed.

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.183
Towards more by really friendly.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:50.154
Being more expensive and then

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:51.955
there needs to be --

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:54.858
Some kind of up impact on market

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.393
forces and so for this panel as

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.761
well as the next may have some

00:44:57.828 --> 00:44:59.830
insight on this --

00:44:59.897 --> 00:45:00.697
Are there.

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:03.567
Technologies --

00:45:03.634 --> 00:45:06.770
In and and send a card to touch

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:07.671
on a little bit other some

00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:08.405
technologies.

00:45:08.472 --> 00:45:09.673
Alternatives to plastics that

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.276
we're seeing that our scalable

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.610
yet or we just because I know

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.378
that there are some.

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.313
Builders are starting to make

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.082
some bottles at our plant days

00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:19.083
to stardom a surly make utensils

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:21.118
what have you but I I don't

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.953
believe it's scalable to the to

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.922
the extent regular place.

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:27.958
Plastic production and does

00:45:28.025 --> 00:45:30.060
regulation help get us there in

00:45:30.127 --> 00:45:32.663
terms of forcing the issue to

00:45:32.729 --> 00:45:33.630
create.

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:35.499
That demand but because that's

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.401
where the supply side innovation

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:39.403
oftentimes comes from

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.703
[inaudible]

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:46.110
You can. Two of the ecologists

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:49.079
will respond --

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:51.949
If.

00:45:52.015 --> 00:45:52.616
The is an excellent question and

00:45:52.683 --> 00:45:53.250
you nailed it on the head --

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:56.820
This question of of where do you

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:00.691
where do the consumer behavior --

00:46:00.757 --> 00:46:03.694
Solutions lie verses the

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.661
regulatory the incentives and

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.563
disincentives lie and so that

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.533
analysis I think is critical --

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.501
And there are other fields

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:12.436
fisheries management which is

00:46:12.503 --> 00:46:14.171
when I work in more --

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:16.306
Is really looks at the the

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:19.076
potential importance of consumer

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:20.477
decisions and where those are

00:46:20.544 --> 00:46:23.881
most effective rather relative

00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:25.816
to regulatory actions.

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:28.785
On but I think the are you

00:46:28.852 --> 00:46:30.821
Asians that are emerging now are

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.623
in fact scalable.

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:35.626
And the the question is how do

00:46:35.692 --> 00:46:36.727
you scale them do you use that

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:39.429
mechanism of consumer behavior.

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:43.333
And or do you use the regulatory.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.301
And imagine might be a

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:46.103
combination of both Alexakis

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.271
wait for one or the other by

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:50.007
itself and then --

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:52.075
Another another note that it

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:53.911
seems quite apparent that it's

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:54.978
really smaller plastics are

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:55.913
plastic that are broken down

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.749
into smaller pieces are causing.

00:46:58.815 --> 00:47:01.652
An enormous issues that just.

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.620
But this really is laws --

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:05.589
Operationally it's easier to

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:06.456
capture.

00:47:06.523 --> 00:47:07.658
Last night with water damage

00:47:07.724 --> 00:47:08.792
control and sounds a we have the

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:10.360
scrubbers and you can see.

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:10.961
It's picking up these larger

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.462
pieces but clearly you know it

00:47:12.529 --> 00:47:15.132
it's bottle caps are small those

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:16.133
the what does of the items that

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.167
have a greater chance.

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:18.135
Of of following through so I

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:20.103
agree that --

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.072
Kind of focusing on ways to cut

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:24.074
back on the need for some of

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.943
those smaller plastics as summer

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:27.878
stone is worked on and I know

00:47:27.945 --> 00:47:28.812
that --

00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:29.713
There may be other areas in

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.982
terms of the kind of plastics it

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:33.884
that's used its ability to be

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.686
able to break down exacerbate

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.521
existing intact.

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:38.455
I I think --

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:42.726
Would have an impact certainly

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.229
on the oceans.

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.097
Your first question I know there

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:47.431
are -- Some

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:49.099
innovation centers in California

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.001
and that are doing materials

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.102
innovation for plastic

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:52.970
alternatives --

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:54.304
To the best of my knowledge none

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.939
of those are scalable yet but it

00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:58.008
is an ongoing area of research

00:47:58.075 --> 00:48:00.644
and there's a lot of interest.

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.679
And I think there's not a lot of

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:04.548
answers on the micro.

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:06.416
Plastics issue because there's

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:07.517
it's a brand new issue and I

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:08.885
think a lot a lot of research

00:48:08.952 --> 00:48:10.420
necessarily but the fact that

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:11.355
they're finding micro.

00:48:11.421 --> 00:48:13.323
Plastics in bottled water

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.192
people's blood streams lots of

00:48:15.259 --> 00:48:16.493
places that are alarming is

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:17.261
something that.

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:19.429
The is an issue we need to be

00:48:19.496 --> 00:48:20.063
talking about.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.000
An end what's interesting as

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:23.834
well from you you referred

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.902
correctly to the straw bale that

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.238
it's more of a straw options

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:28.772
bill.

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:31.541
But the power of even though

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:32.876
that's and options bill the

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.845
power of having the conversation.

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.480
There are.

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:37.547
People across the country that

00:48:37.614 --> 00:48:38.749
are very worried about the straw

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:41.285
band that came out of California.

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:42.386
And the more they're talking

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.154
about it is a strong bad starts

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:45.222
to have the desired effect of

00:48:45.289 --> 00:48:47.057
making people think about

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:49.059
whether they want. To use straws

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.327
or not in fact we were in a

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:52.129
restaurant last night and

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:53.864
offered straws that we were told

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.799
not plastic its cellulose.

00:48:55.866 --> 00:48:57.868
It wasn't it was plastic.

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.936
But the there's lots of

00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:02.606
confusion but it is interesting

00:49:02.673 --> 00:49:03.940
just having a conversation and

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:05.709
and the opportunity for people

00:49:05.776 --> 00:49:07.477
to take some responsibility and

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.346
and some awareness.

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:10.514
I think that's one of the

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.615
biggest impacts that we can have

00:49:11.682 --> 00:49:13.250
by having these conversations.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.319
Yeah but we also have to be

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:18.155
careful of how it's interpreted

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.256
I'm I was really happy to hear

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:20.924
that Starbucks was moving away

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.359
from any classics Ross anywhere

00:49:22.426 --> 00:49:22.959
in the country.

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:24.328
With a lot less thrilled about

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:25.829
that when I found out they were

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:27.798
individually wrapping all of

00:49:27.864 --> 00:49:30.667
their paper straws in plastic.

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:31.234
Which they are have in which

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:35.572
they are doing and so on is not

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:38.608
I guess the message got

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:41.278
partially there but yeah.

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:43.280
That's interesting I I had.

00:49:43.347 --> 00:49:44.581
Right other questions from the

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:45.182
assembly members.

00:49:45.248 --> 00:49:47.250
I think we'll move on that thank

00:49:47.317 --> 00:49:50.053
you very much to this panel that

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.654
was very interesting and will

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:55.792
call up.

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:56.793
It'll be.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.961
After today from save our shores

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:58.862
Tim guns rob from Santa Cruz

00:49:58.929 --> 00:50:01.665
County and Charles hug from

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.500
Republic services.

The best the best [inaudible]

00:50:30.026 --> 00:50:43.273
Unless a Waldron member Reginald.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.641
Welcome so again with they would

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.276
similarly just have the analyst

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.377
give us their their perspectives

00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.379
on next steps that will will go

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:52.149
in order. For the day Mister

00:50:52.215 --> 00:50:54.885
nonprofit Mister how good.

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.787
So please welcome.

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.755
The morning everyone and thank

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.724
you assembly member stone and

00:51:00.791 --> 00:51:01.658
McCarty --

00:51:01.725 --> 00:51:02.559
For inviting me here to speak

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:04.561
this is a subject that's very

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.530
near and dear to my heart as

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:07.631
it's something that we work in

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.433
every day --

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.468
I also have a strong background

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:13.170
in plastics and plastic

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.205
pollution having worked.

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:17.073
For almost ten years --

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:21.011
With an organization called.

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.946
Which is a spin off of eco

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:24.948
designer bill McDonough for

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:26.850
those of you may know that name --

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.686
Is so I've worked a long time on

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.788
issues of plastic especially

00:51:31.855 --> 00:51:32.856
with the plastic --

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:34.558
Packaging sector --

00:51:34.624 --> 00:51:36.493
But that's another story so they

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.495
will stay focused on weight

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:41.364
saver shorts is doing --

00:51:41.431 --> 00:51:45.101
Next slide please --

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:46.303
Probably knew all of you from

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.604
Santa Cruz and even though it's

00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:49.005
from other parts of the state

00:51:49.072 --> 00:51:50.240
may know then savor Chaudhry's.

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:51.174
It's been around for forty years

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.809
now this is our fortieth

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.911
anniversary and we've been

00:51:54.978 --> 00:51:56.713
protecting being marine

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.715
ecosystem along the central

00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.750
coast and particularly within

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:01.651
the boundaries of that.

00:52:01.718 --> 00:52:02.652
Monterey Bay national marine

00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:06.523
sanctuary for those forty years

00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:07.724
for decades we've worked on

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:10.293
everything from the original oil

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.628
and gas drilling threat which

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:14.197
we've now come full circle in

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:16.233
our dressing again under.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.367
A small T. little any trump

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.970
administration --

00:52:20.036 --> 00:52:22.239
We are have also don't with.

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:25.775
Cruise ships marine acoustics --

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:26.977
More recently the plastic

00:52:27.043 --> 00:52:30.680
pollution we've dealt with sand

00:52:30.747 --> 00:52:32.582
mining on your insurance and we

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.484
take on most issues that affect

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:35.752
that the health and well being

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:39.623
of our coastal environment.

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:42.425
Next line --

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:44.561
Last year two thousand seven we

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:45.195
came out with a new vision

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:46.263
twenty twenty five and strategy

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:46.930
that will guide our work for at

00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.398
least the next ten years and

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:49.165
possibly beyond.

00:52:49.232 --> 00:52:51.101
And when the strategy process we

00:52:51.167 --> 00:52:53.069
asked what conditions would we

00:52:53.136 --> 00:52:54.971
need to have a thriving Monterey

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.773
Bay and we came up with the

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.741
three pillars.

00:52:57.807 --> 00:52:59.109
That are guiding our strategies

00:52:59.175 --> 00:53:02.512
and tactics the habitats and

00:53:02.579 --> 00:53:03.813
living waters of course plastic

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.749
pollution affects all three of

00:53:05.815 --> 00:53:08.485
those conditions next.

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:10.554
So it the problem which is

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.322
really become a crisis and I

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:14.357
think it's elevated to the point

00:53:14.424 --> 00:53:15.525
of crisis on a global level next

00:53:15.592 --> 00:53:18.061
line.

00:53:18.128 --> 00:53:19.329
So back in the nineteen fifties

00:53:19.396 --> 00:53:21.131
plastics were first introduced

00:53:21.197 --> 00:53:22.933
into the world to and this is a

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.769
picture from life magazine.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.704
Some of you were old enough to

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.739
remember that publication many

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:31.608
probably not --

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:32.809
And that this was you know like

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:35.745
wow all excited American how his

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:36.379
wife you're going to be.

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:39.349
Free from washing dishes and

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:41.251
making food and everything else

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.153
we had plastics and processed

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.255
food came on the market and life

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:47.123
is good and wonderful and in

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.191
sort of a convenience mindset

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:50.226
really took hold to the consumer

00:53:50.293 --> 00:53:53.997
inconvenience mindsets next.

00:53:54.064 --> 00:53:54.898
But today we see a whole

00:53:54.965 --> 00:53:55.932
different picture we've gone and

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:57.767
sort of these roughly sixty

00:53:57.834 --> 00:53:59.736
sixty five years from a love

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:01.605
affair with plastics.

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.506
To heed affair with plastic in

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:05.642
in you know major super concern

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:07.410
around the globe and protests

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:09.312
and you know people demanding

00:54:09.379 --> 00:54:11.481
that we take action on this

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.249
crisis that's taken over.

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:14.551
Our globin in particular our

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:17.187
most important resource the

00:54:17.253 --> 00:54:17.387
ocean.

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:18.054
Next.

00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.256
So packaging is really sort of

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:22.192
the poster child for our current

00:54:22.258 --> 00:54:24.894
economic system in consumer --

00:54:24.961 --> 00:54:27.097
Economy which is basically a

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:29.633
take make waste systems very

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.635
winning your we take resources

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:32.702
from the earth we turn it into a

00:54:32.769 --> 00:54:34.704
product we use it often for a

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.374
very brief period of time.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.510
And we just throw it away except

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:44.147
there is no away --

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:46.216
This is actually a can of what I

00:54:46.282 --> 00:54:47.117
think is the sad state of

00:54:47.183 --> 00:54:49.085
recycling especially in this

00:54:49.152 --> 00:54:51.254
country we have probably one of

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:51.921
the worst --

00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:54.090
Recycling rates in the world

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.225
even though we are one of the

00:54:55.291 --> 00:54:57.661
most highly technologically

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.729
involved countries --

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.798
You can see here 78% of the U.

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.733
S. waste stream could be

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.369
recycled that means there are

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:07.404
actually.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:08.638
Techniques and across the seas

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.274
that can recycle that material

00:55:11.341 --> 00:55:13.309
but we're only recycling around

00:55:13.376 --> 00:55:15.178
30% in that 30%.

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:20.950
Is rounded up it's like --

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.152
Twenty seven again so we've gone

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.253
from love to hate and here are

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.788
some of the reasons why you know

00:55:24.854 --> 00:55:26.022
we have eight million metric

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:27.691
tons of plastic going into or

00:55:27.757 --> 00:55:28.625
ocean.

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:32.495
Every year we have --

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:33.496
Two point five billion metric

00:55:33.563 --> 00:55:36.399
tons of solid waste produced

00:55:36.466 --> 00:55:38.368
around the world every year --

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:39.469
It you know there's one study

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:41.237
out there that.

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.439
Not really tongue in cheek but I

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:45.241
think not entirely accurate me I

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:46.342
either because we actually don't

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:47.343
know how many fish are in the

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:49.112
scene but there's a study out

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.181
there that says by twenty fifty

00:55:51.247 --> 00:55:52.082
if we keep on the path we're

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:54.751
going to be more plastic than

00:55:54.818 --> 00:55:54.951
fish.

00:55:55.018 --> 00:55:58.655
Inner ocean --

00:55:58.722 --> 00:55:59.689
Master here some later

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:00.657
statistics from our data

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.759
collection needs are twenty

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:03.593
seventeen numbers.

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.628
We see cigarette* you sure --

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.597
Up at the top and for those of

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:09.365
you who don't know that is the

00:56:09.432 --> 00:56:11.334
plastic litter problem it's not

00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:14.204
a paper filter it's made of a

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:16.106
polymer.

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.975
They don't know exactly assembly

00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:21.878
but it's it's plastic pollution

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.813
all those cigarette* we see.

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.915
And I think that those are.

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:28.685
Maybe not intended an instances

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:29.586
of later but certainly

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:32.489
thoughtless instances of later

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.523
where people test.

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:35.525
Done throw it.

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:36.760
And we learned behavior for

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.528
movies and TV and you know

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.662
everything for your for decades

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:41.264
and decades --

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:44.100
Yes let's get to the solutions

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.169
which you know I think that has

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.939
a lot to do with smart policy.

00:56:50.006 --> 00:56:51.808
So our theory of change and save

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:52.809
our shores is based on awareness

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:55.044
advocacy in action and those are

00:56:55.111 --> 00:56:56.746
the primary ways that we drive

00:56:56.813 --> 00:56:58.681
positive change.

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.784
So often you know --

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:02.786
Our role is to make people aware

00:57:02.852 --> 00:57:04.621
of the issue and where of some

00:57:04.687 --> 00:57:06.656
of the solutions in ways that

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:08.358
they can change their behavior

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:10.260
we to a lot of that through

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:11.294
formal education.

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:12.529
We believe you know we have an

00:57:12.595 --> 00:57:15.231
opportunity to teach the next

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:16.099
generation not.

00:57:16.166 --> 00:57:18.134
To climb onto the convenience

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:20.036
lifestyle --

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.070
To better understand that there

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.872
is no one way when we throw

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.774
things away that there is --

00:57:24.841 --> 00:57:26.776
Consequences and soon bill

00:57:26.843 --> 00:57:28.678
generations that have a greater

00:57:28.745 --> 00:57:29.779
environmental ethics and then we

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:35.485
did in previous generations --

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:35.785
Advocacy --

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:40.390
We ever local lawmakers that

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:43.193
city level regional county level

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:45.161
and state level --

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.063
And we had a lot of success and

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.231
sort of driving some of these

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.034
policies to to be enacted

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.135
especially in our local

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:53.837
communities.

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:55.171
Inter action you know all of it

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:57.907
is action really but we also are

00:57:57.974 --> 00:57:59.609
able to turn out literally

00:57:59.676 --> 00:58:00.877
thousands like eleven thousand

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:03.546
volunteers the year to help us.

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.415
Do our education and outreach

00:58:05.481 --> 00:58:07.417
support or advocacy work in a

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:10.320
lot of it to come out and clean

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.254
up our shores we had.

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.122
Over three thousand volunteers

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:15.225
came out for one day on annual

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:17.227
coastal cleanup day which is

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:18.962
also international coastal

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:19.996
cleanup day.

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.998
In removed well over eleven

00:58:22.065 --> 00:58:23.933
thousand pounds of trash and

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.002
like three hours that one day

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:28.705
next.

00:58:28.771 --> 00:58:30.673
So some packaging bands that

00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.475
save our shores started without

00:58:32.542 --> 00:58:34.510
the local level ways.

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:35.712
Able to get past in the in many

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:37.447
of our incorporated cities and

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.482
Santa Cruz in Monterey county as

00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:43.186
well as the counties themselves --

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.088
You know we've had polystyrene

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:48.992
band going back from. To the

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.126
twenty ten to one talk more

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:50.994
about that some just gonna kind

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:52.095
of glossed over that for now

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:54.130
also plastic bags we were when

00:58:54.197 --> 00:58:54.831
in the first.

00:58:54.898 --> 00:58:56.766
Communities Santa Cruz and

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:58.701
Monterey county center and

00:58:58.768 --> 00:59:00.536
incorporated areas that.

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.605
Did a plastic bag band and I

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:04.407
think we got something like

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:06.509
fifty six ordinances passed in

00:59:06.576 --> 00:59:08.478
local regional area and then as

00:59:08.544 --> 00:59:10.413
we see that became a state wide

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.348
success story.

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:15.151
Anna.

00:59:15.218 --> 00:59:18.221
Sort of attacked by citizen

00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.989
support to make sure that we

00:59:20.056 --> 00:59:21.824
kept that law on the books and

00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:23.960
we're the only state that has it.

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:24.794
And then --

00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:26.863
We expanded our poly styrene

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.933
ordinance in sap is Santa Cruz

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.535
County to include other to go

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:36.339
food service where like straw is --

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:39.242
Non recyclable are nine composed

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:41.311
Monique you.

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:43.212
On the Philippines.

00:59:43.279 --> 00:59:50.920
When you meet with?

00:59:50.987 --> 00:59:52.789
You can thank you --

00:59:52.855 --> 00:59:54.791
In even stronger see we actually

00:59:54.857 --> 00:59:56.726
know what the state law.

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:58.761
An option bill or whatever you

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.596
call it in sacks Santa Cruz

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.565
really do have a straw man is

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:04.434
now in supposed to go.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.435
We can't.

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:05.935
Give it out if it's not

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.470
recyclable and compostable and

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:08.438
then in the restaurants no it

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:11.207
has to be on demand so in effect

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.110
we have a strong band here next

01:00:14.177 --> 01:00:14.410
[inaudible]

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:17.080
Of so --

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.082
Policy work really does pay

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.950
office you can see.

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.018
On the left --

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:25.788
Poly styrene numbers in two

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:26.723
thousand eight before we had any

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.726
kind of the ordinances we're

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.560
about.

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:32.628
Yes significant levels of trash

01:00:32.695 --> 01:00:34.464
collected.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.401
Going down down down.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.403
320-122-01314 across the board

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.271
in or download data collection

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:43.373
is in the normally where it has

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.308
gone back up but we think this

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:47.977
is a two year is where we did.

01:00:48.044 --> 01:00:49.312
We started our extreme clean up

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.881
pro.

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.916
Some of the caves and other you

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:56.052
know areas along the shores that

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.887
are hard to access up into the

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.623
rocks and boulders more into the

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:02.525
dunes and working with --

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:04.527
Even the am U. S. navy and

01:01:04.594 --> 01:01:07.363
cleaning some of their doing

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.297
sites are we would get out.

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:11.367
Yeah probably twenty five

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.169
thousand pounds of trash from

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:15.338
homeless camps to just abandon

01:01:15.405 --> 01:01:16.539
stuff for years and years and

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:18.007
years.

01:01:18.074 --> 01:01:20.910
And then you know after extreme

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.045
cleanups cleanup so went down

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:24.714
you can see we're back to pretty

01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:27.750
low levels of poly styrene --

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.519
Mostly what we see here now

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:31.621
chunks of it links probably from

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:32.889
coolers and always sorts of

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:33.456
things.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.490
And then --

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.726
In terms of bags it's a really

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:37.360
clear.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.229
Success in terms of how policy

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:43.166
helps and smart policy works.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.634
We didn't even have the bump up

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.437
in the twenty thirteen twenty

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.104
fourteen when you were doing are

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:49.105
extreme cleanups.

01:01:49.172 --> 01:01:50.973
Next.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.876
So going forward we have some

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.812
ambitious plans on the local

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:56.712
level --

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:57.713
Which we hope will eventually go

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:00.550
up to the state level we have

01:02:00.616 --> 01:02:01.818
six items that were targeting

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.786
right now and we have already

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:07.356
approach thingy --

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.424
Board of supervisors in Santa

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:11.227
Cruz and the city council in

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.229
Santa Cruz will be reaching out

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.163
to the other incorporated areas

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:17.066
and Santa Cruz probably before

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:18.234
the end of this week and into

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:19.001
monitoring.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.104
Next week and what we're asking

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:23.806
for is.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.074
Some kind of a solution for the

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:27.777
six problem so we have the tiny

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:28.644
little toiletry bottles and

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:30.680
we've all seen in hotels.

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:32.482
They hardly even ever get used

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:34.450
even if they do they're not for

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.385
we used all of that is put into

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:39.355
the trash every day thousands of

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:40.223
bottles.

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:42.291
Much of industry is already

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.159
starting to move in the

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.094
direction of eliminating those

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.163
in favor of of well known and

01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:49.966
dispensers we have asked.

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.100
For an ordinance in Santa Cruz

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:53.069
County in the city and we will

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:54.003
be in to these other

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.771
jurisdictions.

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:57.039
That the use of those in the

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.775
hospitality industry be banned

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:02.612
in favor of one mounted.

01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:03.880
Really pleased to say we have a

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.550
board of super this initiative

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.285
and the county.

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:10.553
In will probably on an ordinance

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:16.092
by the end of the year.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:19.896
In the company of the will is.

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.030
What might be fun actually

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:23.766
playing no real needed purpose

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:24.834
and world --

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.969
It yet you know they cause a lot

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.738
of problems in terms of being

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:30.573
let go drifting in New York

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.542
oceans and tangled the

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.443
stuttering cetera --

01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:37.280
Also ingestion where scan for a

01:03:37.346 --> 01:03:41.284
ban on the sale balloons on in

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.218
the county.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:44.187
And we will start with the mylar

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.087
balloons which are actually more

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.989
problematic than simple latex

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.991
but we'd like to see them all.

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.927
Eliminated.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:53.062
Contact lenses and interesting

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.697
when it came on our radar screen

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.699
only about a month and a half

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.834
two months Max ago and this was

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.703
as a result of a study that came

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:02.605
out I of all people the American

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.440
chemistry council.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.309
And keep sort of playing with

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:08.377
why would they put the study out

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:09.412
and the only reason I can think

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.214
of is to takes are to blame on

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.182
industry or the focus off of

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:15.151
industry as the problem and put

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:16.919
it on consumers as the problem

01:04:16.986 --> 01:04:18.020
because the issue here is.

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:22.758
That one out of five users of

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:23.793
the daily disposables.

01:04:23.859 --> 01:04:25.695
Question down the toilet.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:26.829
We don't want that to happen

01:04:26.896 --> 01:04:28.564
because the water treatment

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.666
facilities can't deal with that

01:04:30.733 --> 01:04:32.535
their screens at Saturn not

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:35.471
small enough to collect and send

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.405
these training at all.

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.473
Maker plastic products.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.375
On their way for plastics even

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.177
in their full state or being fly

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.411
straight into our waterways and

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.113
inter ocean.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.149
In becoming you know we we're

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:49.018
not seeing it so much nobody's.

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:53.189
Reporting the pick up of contact

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.692
lenses honor they're so we'd

01:04:56.759 --> 01:04:57.793
like some kind of a take back.

01:04:57.860 --> 01:04:59.595
Current extended producer

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.631
responsibility long time to deal

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:04.533
with not taking contacts and we

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.434
from people for sure.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.371
On the giving them away to take

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:09.538
them back to drop them off and

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:11.674
have the manufacturing deal with

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.142
them.

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:14.310
Micro fibers is kind of the

01:05:14.377 --> 01:05:17.013
newest thing on the radar screen

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:18.914
this is little pieces sort of

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:19.148
like --

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.017
Strand of hair that just flops

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:23.786
off your Palmer base closings --

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.788
Every time that you wash it and

01:05:25.855 --> 01:05:27.690
so is simple solution there is

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.593
installation of filters on

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.428
washing machines --

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:33.429
You know even the more expensive

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.764
ones are only about a hundred

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.732
and fifty dollars so we're

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:38.267
asking that.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.235
All commercial laundry

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.569
facilities which would be the

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.338
laundry service says laundromats

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.106
dry cleaners --

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.242
Hospitality industry that still

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:48.944
does their own laundry and

01:05:49.011 --> 01:05:50.846
apartment complexes with

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.748
multiple laundry machines

01:05:52.815 --> 01:05:54.050
install filters on them so that

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.686
we can begin to stop the flow of

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.054
that through our waterways and

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.623
into the ocean.

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:03.592
Hi too many people today can't

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.394
as a convenience have have

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:07.296
bought your rank and espresso

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.464
coffee tape machines were you

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.399
put in a little tiny get you one

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.233
Cup of coffee.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.436
You just dump the pod and in the

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:15.037
trash.

01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:17.907
And those are not recyclable

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:20.042
learning compostable and its

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.309
first --

01:06:20.376 --> 01:06:22.812
Does have a take back program so

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.714
we're not targeting without

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.115
those pod so much but the pods

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.683
that are not recyclable are

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.652
composed of only blank ban on

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:30.553
the sale of those.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.823
In our community and then the

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:38.227
whole the plastic bottles --

01:06:38.294 --> 01:06:40.429
We know that in our communities

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:42.231
most people are already using

01:06:42.298 --> 01:06:46.035
reusable drinking containers.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.236
Nine is we want to finally put a

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:49.305
stop to the sale of those single

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:50.873
use.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:53.008
The water bottles anything under

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.844
a gallon [inaudible]

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.681
And if I were clean it when

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.616
being all beverage bottles all

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.518
plastic beverage bottles but

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:04.353
when we can put out hydration

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.455
stations for people to go water

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.523
we can't necessarily put them

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.291
out for people that.

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:12.328
We fail a coke or juice or

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:17.233
something mobile for you.

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:21.771
And Katharine for queen here --

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:22.838
So I'm gonna wrap it up there --

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.907
And if you have any morning join

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:28.644
our campaign just contact me.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.546
Clean ups you can contact air.

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:31.947
Volunteer so she it and then you

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.749
know check out our website for

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:34.417
what else we're doing thank you

01:07:34.483 --> 01:07:34.717
[inaudible]

01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:38.254
Thank you.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.256
This without her.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.357
What we're waiting for the

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:43.325
presentational out I thought I'd

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.193
ask?

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.394
How many of you came here from

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.962
out of town today?

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.964
Quite a few.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.966
Well if you look around and as

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.770
you ride you can see.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:55.805
Why were so Phillies fiercely

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:57.740
protective of our local

01:07:57.807 --> 01:07:59.575
environment here we have?

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:01.577
A lot at stake.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.579
And it's one of the big reasons

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:05.381
why so many.

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:06.582
Innovations environmental

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.484
protection began right here in

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.186
Santa Cruz County.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:11.320
And I'm gonna share a few of

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:13.088
those with you today.

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:16.992
Next slide please.

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:18.861
We a one of the most

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.095
comprehensive environmental

01:08:20.162 --> 01:08:22.898
education programs in this

01:08:22.965 --> 01:08:24.700
county that you'll find.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:25.701
Anywhere.

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:28.571
Every child in school yes

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:30.506
education in.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.409
Elementary school and beyond.

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:34.443
They all learn to recycle it

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.412
practices every day at school

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:38.314
they all learn about.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.182
Composting their food waste many

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.084
of them get to work in their

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.086
school gardens and learn about

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.020
the benefits of compost.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:48.090
We have a program through on

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:49.959
you'll see us see where children

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:50.826
can.

01:08:50.893 --> 01:08:53.729
Go out on a boat on the bay.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.599
And actually take up samples

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.634
look at plankton under a

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.569
microscope and see for

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.537
themselves.

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.472
The plastic pollution in our

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.374
waters and learn about the

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.475
impacts of that.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:07.576
So they get a very thorough

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.144
understanding.

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:11.347
Of how the way that they live

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:13.215
their lives affects the

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.084
environment around them.

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:16.418
And that's something that they

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.320
carry with them as they go

01:09:18.387 --> 01:09:19.054
through life [inaudible]

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:21.924
Next line.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.727
We also do a lot to educate the

01:09:24.793 --> 01:09:25.828
general public we have

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:28.564
newsletters that go out to every

01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.466
home and business several times

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:31.500
year.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.369
We have constant ads in the

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:34.403
print media.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.273
On TV and on radio if your local

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.308
you probably hear these.

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.243
Every day urging people not to

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.146
litter remember to recycle and

01:09:44.213 --> 01:09:46.048
other versions of that and one

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.017
of the challenges that all of us

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.952
in coastal communities in

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.820
particular have is.

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:53.822
How do we educate the the hordes

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.658
of visitors that we get

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:57.626
especially in the summer?

01:09:57.693 --> 01:09:58.661
About respecting our local

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:00.696
environment and what you see on

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.565
the lower left there.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:03.666
Is an experiment we tried a few

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:06.435
years ago using our buses as

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.503
rolling billboards.

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:11.340
And we had San and similar ones

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:14.009
at on buses all over the county

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:15.210
you could hardly miss them they

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.111
were.

01:10:16.178 --> 01:10:17.913
Controversy all but to me that

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.248
that was a good thing they got

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:20.849
people's attention.

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:23.752
Next slide please.

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:24.753
Hey.

01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.590
As was mentioned earlier we are

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:31.460
facing such a tsunami of plastic.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:33.395
That all our best efforts at

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:36.332
recycling are not enough we have

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.267
to go after the source.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:41.170
And we have done that in

01:10:41.236 --> 01:10:44.073
numerous ways locally and in the

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.008
twenty but a few of those next.

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:48.911
Poly styrene as was mentioned.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:51.780
It is a very difficult product

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.849
to recycle properly.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:54.683
Because it's so frequently

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.620
contaminated with food residue.

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.556
Because of its lightweight its

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.424
bulky miss it's low value.

01:11:02.491 --> 01:11:04.393
Economically and logistically

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.462
just rarely makes sense to

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:07.396
recycle if.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:11.133
So as Catherine mentioned.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.036
There's a taper.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.038
Off excellent.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.040
In -- Two

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:18.674
thousand eight senators county

01:11:18.741 --> 01:11:19.808
was among the first to prohibit

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.810
the use of styrofoam and food

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:22.745
service.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:26.615
But we were still seeing it our

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.584
parks on our beaches serve few

01:11:28.651 --> 01:11:31.520
years later we took the next

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:31.720
step.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.622
Of saying are you cancel the

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.524
stuff in our county anymore is

01:11:35.591 --> 01:11:37.326
people were going to the store

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.228
and buying styrofoam cooler

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:41.130
styrofoam cups other similar

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:42.231
products.

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.099
Taking it to the beach and

01:11:44.166 --> 01:11:45.968
leaving it there.

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:48.003
We very rarely see that anymore

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.871
as Catherine mansion.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:51.740
Prohibiting retail sales of poly

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.676
styrene from products.

01:11:53.742 --> 01:11:54.677
Has.

01:11:54.743 --> 01:11:56.645
Almost completely solve that

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.580
problem next please.

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.683
Plastic bags Chen Cruz County

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:04.420
was among the very first. To

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.455
initiate a ban on single use

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:09.158
plastic bags --

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.292
Because there was so little

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:12.361
track record we weren't really

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:14.229
sure what the impact is going to

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.331
be so we sent teams out to local

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.934
shopping areas to monitor.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.235
Our people handling this are

01:12:20.302 --> 01:12:22.838
they getting paper bags of the

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.807
they buying bags are they doing

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:25.741
with our they bring in their own.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:28.510
We found the remarkably within

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:29.812
thirty days of the effective

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.447
date of that ordinance.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:35.317
More than 90% of local shoppers

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.252
were bringing their own backs.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:40.122
As in Santa of in a mitigation --

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:43.125
For we had some wonderful

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.928
reusable bags made a here's an

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:48.864
example it said.

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.866
Organic cotton that.

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.901
Grounded manufactured in the US

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:55.804
made with non VOC a stack of

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.005
these are in the back of the

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:58.607
room so please help yourself to

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.609
learn on their way out it's the

01:13:00.676 --> 01:13:01.643
best shopping bag you'll ever

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.544
had.

01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:03.645
We've given out thousands of

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.380
these.

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.249
M. by our estimate we've reduce

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.151
the use of single use plastic

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.186
bags just in this little county.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.055
By a hundred million bags a year

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:13.355
[inaudible]

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:16.992
Thanks.

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:18.861
For as Catherine mentioned --

01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:19.928
Last year we took another

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:22.831
significant step --

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:27.770
We told our food service

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.671
businesses from now on

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.406
everything you.

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:32.007
Is guided the recyclable or

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:33.408
compostable.

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:34.343
Enemies recyclable by our

01:13:34.409 --> 01:13:36.278
standards so a controversial

01:13:36.345 --> 01:13:38.614
examples been the plastic straws

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.214
Wilder.

01:13:39.281 --> 01:13:41.183
Made of a material that is

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.152
technically recyclable because

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:45.053
their small size and weight.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.288
They tend to slip through all

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.156
the recycling machinery so

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.957
practically.

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:50.826
They're not recyclable they're

01:13:50.893 --> 01:13:51.927
no longer allowed you will no

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:54.797
longer find plastics rose is

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:55.664
Santa Cruz County businesses.

01:13:55.731 --> 01:13:57.900
Same is true of plastic stir

01:13:57.966 --> 01:14:01.503
state pencils --

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.505
You may not be aware that --

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:06.408
If you buy a Cup of coffee to go.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:07.509
That paper Cup is lined with

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.244
plastic but not in Santa Cruz

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.179
County.

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:11.280
In there many other similar

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:14.082
changes that we've implemented.

01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:15.284
Beginning almost two years ago

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.853
now and it's been extremely

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:18.153
effective.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:22.691
The excellent.

01:14:22.758 --> 01:14:24.960
I mentioned where we tend to

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.562
innovate --

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:28.530
It's it's both a blessing and

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.999
sometimes it occurs that there's

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:31.600
so much.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.669
Support here for environmental

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.437
protection that --

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:36.338
People --

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.507
Tend to give us kudos for about

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:39.541
a week and then they want to

01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.642
know what else you got.

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.544
So we're always looking to do

01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:43.111
more.

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:46.915
And often because we go first.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.016
We hear from other cities

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.886
counties other states even other

01:14:50.953 --> 01:14:52.688
countries how did you do this

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:53.722
can I get a copy.

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.757
How can we do that?

01:14:55.824 --> 01:14:59.595
In you should is duplicated many

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.597
many times --

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.332
Ordinances that were first

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:04.366
introduced in Santa Cruz County.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.235
Have been adopted in San

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:08.270
Francisco Seattle.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:11.139
Boulder Colorado New York City

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.074
many other places.

01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.977
Next slide please.

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:16.945
I want to talk a little bit

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.847
about working with big business

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.749
sometimes when we talk about

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:23.819
these issues we see them as the

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:25.687
problem as the enemy.

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.556
And I want to encourage people

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:28.624
to think about the opportunities

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:30.492
for partnerships.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:33.362
We have found that the leverage

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:34.463
provided.

01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:37.266
By a well crafted initiative

01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:39.201
even at the local level even a

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.103
small jurisdiction like this.

01:15:41.169 --> 01:15:43.071
Can have profound consequences

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:45.240
and we have lots of examples of

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.408
those and I just mention a

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.310
couple here that I want to share

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.779
with you --

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.814
When we introduce the bad I Poly

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.617
starring from in food service?

01:15:55.684 --> 01:15:57.486
All local businesses got on

01:15:57.552 --> 01:16:00.722
board very quickly some of the

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:02.424
national chains set up.

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:03.325
Are we gonna do this.

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.526
And we talked to the local

01:16:04.593 --> 01:16:06.361
managers and it's a you know we

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:09.197
get this stuff from a warehouse

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:12.134
at a Denver or Chicago or Dallas.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.002
Is sorted at the corporate level

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:15.237
we have nothing to say about

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:15.938
what we use.

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.973
You're going to have to talk to

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.041
the corporate office so we

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:19.841
didn't that.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:22.711
And sometimes it was easy

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.713
sometimes it was a struggle cold

01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:26.615
stone creamery was a struggle

01:16:26.682 --> 01:16:28.550
you may be familiar with them

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:31.453
there at nationwide ice cream

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.554
chain and at that time.

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:34.523
They were serving all of their

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:35.390
ice cream.

01:16:35.457 --> 01:16:39.161
And polystyrene foam balls and

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.162
they like them they worked well

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:43.999
they're cheap they were easy.

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:44.633
But we told him we gotta get rid

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.068
of them.

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:48.937
And I I'll simplify a lot of

01:16:49.004 --> 01:16:50.806
backing for discussion.

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.074
They finally called and said

01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.109
okay we're going to do it's a

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:54.710
great.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.178
So you change out the supplies

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.612
in your local store.

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:57.946
The sudden --

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:59.481
That's too much trouble we're

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:00.549
gonna change of all fourteen

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.417
hundred stores nationwide.

01:17:02.484 --> 01:17:05.320
Because of a local ordinance.

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:07.255
Senate he mentioned Starbucks we

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.091
went through a similar process

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:10.292
with them.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.094
More recently some of you may

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.029
remember several years ago.

01:17:14.096 --> 01:17:16.898
Starbucks trumpeted as a nation

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:19.868
initiative to recycle all of

01:17:19.935 --> 01:17:20.836
their products.

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:24.606
And it was an abysmal failure

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:26.074
stuff was actually going to the

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:26.641
landfill.

01:17:26.708 --> 01:17:28.510
They were really embarrassed

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.445
they failed burned.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.513
They were reluctant to go

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.348
through that again.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:36.218
And yet they are serious about

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.285
becoming more sustainable as

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:40.222
many companies are some of them

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.056
really just.

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:43.492
Trying to do this as a marketing

01:17:43.558 --> 01:17:45.260
measure but many of them are

01:17:45.327 --> 01:17:47.262
serious and they just need a

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:48.897
little help to figure out how.

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:50.932
Knowing that about Starbucks we

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.667
talk to their corporate office

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:54.703
in Seattle and said look.

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.904
We're introducing these new

01:17:55.971 --> 01:17:57.672
rules locally it's only gonna

01:17:57.739 --> 01:18:00.709
affect four stores in Santa Cruz

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:01.410
County.

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.578
Why don't you see this as an

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:04.446
experiment?

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.314
It'll work so well here.

01:18:06.381 --> 01:18:08.250
Maybe you can introduce some of

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.217
this more broadly.

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:11.253
Well it worked out very well and

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:13.088
some of you probably saw their

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:14.022
press release.

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:16.058
A few months ago that based on

01:18:16.124 --> 01:18:17.959
their success in Santa Cruz

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.795
County the rolling out these

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:21.830
changes to more than twenty

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:22.697
eight thousand stores around the

01:18:22.764 --> 01:18:23.632
world.

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:24.900
As referred there still some

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:25.967
glitches they still have some

01:18:26.034 --> 01:18:27.702
more work to do but they're

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.504
making progress and we're happy

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:30.572
to help them.

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:33.341
Next slide please.

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:34.443
Catherine mentioned some of the

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.377
things in the pipeline and I'll

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:36.645
tell you just a bit more about

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:38.180
them -- One

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:40.115
of our problems and she

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:41.149
mentioned.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:43.185
Is those millions of little

01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:44.920
plastic bottles of personal care

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:47.122
products in hotels and motels

01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:48.890
Mostra which get.

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.192
Thrown away at the end of every

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:51.927
day because it's not practical

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:53.662
for housekeeping to determine

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:54.729
whether they've been used or not

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.598
is incredibly wasteful.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.700
On November twentieth we're

01:18:58.767 --> 01:18:59.534
going to be introducing an

01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:02.370
ordinance to require hotels and

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:05.340
motels in Santa Cruz County. To

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:09.211
switch to refill.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.179
Six we are confident that once

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:13.215
this is implemented people

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.117
everywhere else are going to say

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:15.917
again.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:17.319
Why we think of that let's do

01:19:17.385 --> 01:19:18.153
that [inaudible]

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:19.821
I am.

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:21.690
We heard a little bit about

01:19:21.756 --> 01:19:22.724
plastic micro fibers.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:25.093
This may be in new issue to some

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:25.627
of you.

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.563
Most of our close these days are

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.465
made of synthetic fibers and

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.666
every time you do a load of

01:19:31.733 --> 01:19:32.534
laundry.

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:43.011
As many as hundreds of thousands

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:43.612
of micro fibers are shot by

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.212
those close the passed right

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:44.813
through waste water treatment

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.413
plants out to the rivers lakes

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:45.714
and oceans.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:46.281
What is Catherine mentioned

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:47.849
there's a P. simple solution?

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:49.084
They're already filters on the

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:51.720
market they're easy to install

01:19:51.786 --> 01:19:53.755
their widely available they're

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.657
very affordable.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:56.725
So we're going to be introducing

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.693
an ordinance and to require the

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.495
installation of these filters on

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:02.597
washing machines we're going to

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:03.532
begin with commercial

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.267
establishments.

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.368
And hopefully phase in all

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:08.403
washing machines over the course

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.272
of the next three years.

01:20:10.338 --> 01:20:11.106
And again it's something that we

01:20:11.173 --> 01:20:13.975
expect to see become widespread.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.243
And if you want to be as to the

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.311
punch and do it at the state

01:20:16.378 --> 01:20:18.079
level I'd be happy to work with

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.782
you.

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:21.850
Next slide please.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:23.718
So there's more to come but I'm

01:20:23.785 --> 01:20:25.587
gonna start there but before I

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.721
finish I want to offer a special

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:28.490
thank you.

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.659
The innovations that we've we've

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.694
created in this county would not

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:35.330
be possible without.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.232
Courageous political leadership.

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.301
Some of you know the before you

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.136
joined the assembly.

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:41.703
Mark stone was a Santa Cruz

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:44.973
County super in a lot of the

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.074
measures that I've discussed

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.843
happen under his leadership.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:52.647
Sir thank you for that mark.

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:53.081
Alright thank you.

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.649
Charles welcome.

01:20:54.716 --> 01:20:57.552
Thank you good morning.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.454
Assembly member stone.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.590
Cartier Friedman and Kalra on

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:02.557
Chuck help get --

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.459
Director of government affairs

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:05.360
for public services.

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.229
On all dispensed with the usual

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.396
company credits by simply saying

01:21:08.463 --> 01:21:09.397
that Republic services is a

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:11.399
national solid waste services

01:21:11.466 --> 01:21:12.067
company.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.201
Appalling operations recycling

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:16.004
operations composting operations

01:21:16.071 --> 01:21:17.872
in landfills across California.

01:21:17.939 --> 01:21:19.808
And plastics are a major part of

01:21:19.874 --> 01:21:21.876
what we what we do --

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:23.878
I'm very pleased to be invited

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.547
here today --

01:21:25.614 --> 01:21:27.649
As I guess the token waste

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:30.352
management presenter --

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:31.653
Is specifically on that account

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.355
I'll discuss the impacts that

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:34.422
China swords --

01:21:34.489 --> 01:21:36.157
Has on a recycling operations

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:39.194
touch on recyclability.

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.262
Excuse me plastics and briefly

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:43.064
discuss policy options next

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:45.900
slide please.

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.969
Even before China --

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:48.770
Shut the door on recyclable

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:49.938
commodities we're seeing a

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:51.773
significant decline in class

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.808
prices.

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:54.643
Of 40% decline in.

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:57.512
And cardboard.

01:21:57.579 --> 01:21:58.513
Late last year.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:00.515
China basically slammed the door

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:03.418
on on mixed paper and many

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:05.220
plastics do their restrictions

01:22:05.287 --> 01:22:08.356
on on cross contamination --

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.392
How does this relate to plastics

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.093
are mature cover facilities are

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.928
constructed to handle single

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:16.131
products? For the most part --

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:19.868
Even was sources we have comical

01:22:19.934 --> 01:22:21.703
recycle so we must process and

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:22.771
separate.

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:23.872
And and turn into a recyclable

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:27.542
commodity --

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:28.510
Cross contamination of

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:31.346
recyclables or off spec plastics

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.614
are largely responsible for

01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:34.282
contamination.

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.317
In our paper loads --

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.252
Reducing the value and reducing

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.187
recyclability of those materials.

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.123
Slide three please.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:44.959
Shows you some of the trends

01:22:45.026 --> 01:22:46.861
that have occurred and materials

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.763
management from our perspective --

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.898
This material trends of also

01:22:49.964 --> 01:22:52.734
increased contamination and the

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.569
increase recycling costs

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:54.869
[inaudible]

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:57.739
And they've also increased

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.375
consumer misunderstanding I

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:03.278
think it was truly recyclable --

01:23:03.345 --> 01:23:05.180
Is example newsprint has

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.348
virtually disappeared it was a

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:08.483
large part of our are wonderful

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.151
recycling numbers that we've had

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:11.519
in the past retributive to news

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:12.120
print -- But

01:23:12.187 --> 01:23:14.189
newsprint is disappearing we're

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:15.924
we're now reading are.

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:17.792
Our news on our telephones and

01:23:17.859 --> 01:23:19.928
and we're not ordering or

01:23:19.994 --> 01:23:22.697
getting newspapers delivered --

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.699
HSDPA which is recycling which

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:27.502
is a recycle commodity --

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:28.603
Is being replaced by lighter

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:31.373
weight off spec PT.

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:33.341
Hard to distinguish between the

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.276
two and when you.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:37.345
Run those through a every

01:23:37.412 --> 01:23:37.846
facility it is virtually

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:40.215
impossible.

01:23:40.281 --> 01:23:42.117
On ten cans of a replacement on

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:44.185
recycled local PA a copolymer --

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.887
Pouches.

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:46.354
And water bottles are

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.922
increasingly being light

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:48.857
weighted requiring more

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.759
containers baton of recyclable

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:52.694
materials recycle plastics.

01:23:52.761 --> 01:23:53.828
And again increasing shipping

01:23:53.895 --> 01:23:55.630
costs and processing because for

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:56.598
us.

01:23:56.664 --> 01:23:58.500
Next slide please.

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.501
China swords reduce

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.270
contamination --

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:05.473
Late last year 25% in band all

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.207
mixed paper.

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.243
I'm driving costs across the

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:11.079
board and recycling facilities --

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:13.982
Requiring increased --

01:24:14.048 --> 01:24:15.884
Processing time slowing or or

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:16.885
material recovery facilities

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:19.854
lines down adding additional

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.756
people to the pick lines --

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:24.626
And all these.

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:27.529
Dramatically increased our costs.

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:28.897
And while markets in Vietnam

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.398
went in and with the market

01:24:30.465 --> 01:24:31.566
disappearing in China but will

01:24:31.633 --> 01:24:33.368
markets growing in Vietnam in

01:24:33.435 --> 01:24:35.203
India to some degrees help the

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.271
prices --

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.440
Prices continue to be very very

01:24:38.506 --> 01:24:41.075
deflated for most commodities.

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:42.977
Slide.

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.345
Five I'm just a this is a brief

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.848
summary of our really simplistic

01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:48.817
cost structure --

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:50.785
Our costs.

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:52.654
Of our recycling programs that

01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:54.722
we pass on to rate payers are

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.658
based on collection costs.

01:24:56.724 --> 01:24:57.592
Plus processing costs.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:00.395
Plus disposal of residuals.

01:25:00.462 --> 01:25:02.397
Minus commodity prices.

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:05.266
When cost increases sales price

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:07.335
decrease went up and operating

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:09.137
loss preventing investment to

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:10.104
newer?

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:10.572
And better recycling

01:25:10.638 --> 01:25:13.007
infrastructure.

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:16.811
Next slide please.

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.780
This chart is from cal recycle

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:20.748
and reflects the again the

01:25:20.815 --> 01:25:22.717
dramatic decline.

01:25:22.784 --> 01:25:23.651
In the China market for

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.520
recyclable materials.

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.589
And and we all know what we've

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:28.756
heard the impact of China sorts

01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:30.525
on mixed papers and all but I I

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.293
think what's striking here is

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.295
well there weren't a lot of

01:25:34.362 --> 01:25:35.230
plastics going there.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:39.100
Those mark mark to virtually --

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.201
Been shut off completely.

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:43.938
Next slide please.

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.874
So.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:47.842
Can we recycle our way out of

01:25:47.909 --> 01:25:49.811
out of plastic pollution --

01:25:49.878 --> 01:25:51.946
I would submit that the answer

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:53.681
to that question is no.

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:54.549
Not at least with our current

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.518
economic model in our current --

01:25:56.584 --> 01:25:57.819
Solid waste recycling

01:25:57.886 --> 01:26:00.421
infrastructure --

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:03.458
That model has been broken by by

01:26:03.525 --> 01:26:05.159
China's swords a minute

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:06.194
somewhere is.

01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:08.229
Broken in a way that has made us

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:09.297
rethink what we do and how we

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.132
handle recycling --

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:13.034
Across the board not just in

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:13.568
California but across the

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.870
country --

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.805
We've.

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:18.973
Become accustomed to shipping

01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.676
materials to to China with

01:26:21.743 --> 01:26:22.110
excessive amounts of

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:22.610
contamination.

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:25.914
And that is no longer a

01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.416
possibility.

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:30.385
Sorry moving in non recyclable

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.287
plastic contamination food

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:34.389
contamination off specs plastic

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:37.258
and any plastics three through --

01:26:37.325 --> 01:26:38.226
Seven increases Acosta

01:26:38.293 --> 01:26:40.228
processing --

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:42.897
And the value of our commodities

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.098
are be reduced at and at the

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.033
same time the value of our

01:26:45.099 --> 01:26:46.868
materials are are are

01:26:46.935 --> 01:26:48.102
commodities are be reduced by at

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:49.771
least half.

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:50.838
So again this is a model that

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:51.940
can survive from an economic

01:26:52.006 --> 01:26:53.675
perspective.

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:54.809
And that means more of these

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:56.844
recycled plastics wind up our

01:26:56.911 --> 01:26:58.813
landfills and increasingly high

01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.480
costs.

01:26:59.547 --> 01:27:01.783
And potentially more on our

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:04.252
lands and in our waterways

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:06.287
sisters costs increase and an

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:07.221
illegal dumping --

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:10.091
Increases as well.

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:13.094
A just single example of of a

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.862
and I like to use the highlight

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:16.965
this -- Very

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:17.932
the flexible plastics are very

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.901
large problem for us --

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:22.737
They're very light --

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.005
This certainly serve a useful

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:25.673
purpose and I want to talk about

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.475
flexible plastic sandwich bags

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:30.378
would be an example --

01:27:30.445 --> 01:27:32.280
Stretch plastic --

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.415
Around your the shrink wrap it

01:27:34.482 --> 01:27:36.250
goes around packaging --

01:27:36.317 --> 01:27:37.218
They they serve useful

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:39.087
commercial purposes there's no

01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:40.355
no doubt about that but these

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:42.023
materials.

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:43.992
All there are less than 4% of

01:27:44.058 --> 01:27:45.159
our commodities stroke or our

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.861
waste stream.

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.863
Are about 70% of our problems.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.732
And those problems again or

01:27:50.798 --> 01:27:51.799
cross contamination the fact

01:27:51.866 --> 01:27:52.634
that they're indistinguishable

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.637
in optical sorters inner discs

01:27:55.703 --> 01:27:58.439
orders from paper --

01:27:58.506 --> 01:27:59.807
Their let eight create literate

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:01.342
our facilities --

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:02.543
And a increasingly create

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:03.311
equipment failures are

01:28:03.378 --> 01:28:04.545
facilities particularly the

01:28:04.612 --> 01:28:06.347
shrink wrap materials which tend

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:08.182
to get wrapped in toward discs

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.450
orders and shut down our

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:11.085
operations.

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:14.022
Next slide please --

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.857
Our existing and and we saw

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:17.091
earlier slide that somewhat

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:18.993
resembles this but right now our

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:22.664
our our existing plastic

01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:24.599
recycling system council.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:26.567
And in a significant way on a

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:27.535
bottle bill one might many of

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.469
our revenues a commensurate your

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.571
recovery facilities are result

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.407
of the bottle bill --

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.274
With merriment the minimum

01:28:33.341 --> 01:28:35.243
recycle content requirements and

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:36.344
there are some some bands and

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:38.146
most recently a state level the

01:28:38.212 --> 01:28:40.181
the single use plastic bag ban.

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.917
Next slide please.

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:45.787
So so policy considerations --

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:47.789
That that at least I would

01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:48.856
throughout forward for

01:28:48.923 --> 01:28:51.592
discussion today --

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:54.495
And whatever we do I I really do

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.563
think we need to consider the

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.531
true cost of recycling.

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:58.533
In and focus our efforts on that

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:02.303
which is is truly recyclable --

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:03.438
Consider minimum content were

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:05.306
recycling opportunities --

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:07.141
Infrastructure and markets

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:10.111
support that form for coverage --

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.947
Or that fails focus efforts on

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.215
extended producer responsibility

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:14.982
any PR.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.851
Reuse and and potentially

01:29:16.918 --> 01:29:18.786
mandatory take back programs.

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:20.888
Of for the very very hard to

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.724
manage materials --

01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:23.858
User fees for disincentive

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.626
certainly have something that we

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.462
have talked about --

01:29:27.528 --> 01:29:29.430
They can be a disincentive for

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:31.432
they can also be used as

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.367
incentives to support more

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:34.635
effective and broader recycling

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:38.072
programs --

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:40.174
And I think we we we can't state

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.175
enough and I think you've seen

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.977
it on many of the slides here

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:44.045
from from this panel

01:29:44.112 --> 01:29:44.912
particularly.

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.848
Consumer education is is is

01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:48.783
critical contamination issue

01:29:48.850 --> 01:29:50.685
starts -- In

01:29:50.752 --> 01:29:51.819
it and it is from our

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.688
perspective it starts from from

01:29:53.755 --> 01:29:55.490
the generator of the waste --

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:56.891
We can we can certainly talk

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:59.460
about how we must change the the

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.395
plastics waste stream but again

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.264
consumer consumer education on

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:04.298
what they by.

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:06.367
And how they treat their

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:07.468
recyclables what they throw in

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:10.004
the recycling bins is is really

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.073
critical to our success

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:12.340
recycling.

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.107
Thank you [inaudible]

01:30:13.174 --> 01:30:14.842
Thank you.

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:15.910
What what's interesting was a

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:17.979
lot of the impetus here's Santa

01:30:18.045 --> 01:30:20.047
Cruz County for making some of

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:21.649
these changes?

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:22.950
Was fifteen years ago

01:30:23.017 --> 01:30:24.852
realization the landfill was

01:30:24.919 --> 01:30:26.621
going to close.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:26.821
Add.

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:29.390
Try to find another site.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:31.392
In a small county which proved

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:32.293
absolutely impossible.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.428
That force people to think

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:37.131
differently about waste and

01:30:37.198 --> 01:30:39.066
waste management and ensuring

01:30:39.133 --> 01:30:41.035
that we had resources in the

01:30:41.102 --> 01:30:43.104
county instead of sending things

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:44.038
out.

01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.973
Took responsibility.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.108
For what we were using how we

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:49.043
were using at and that made it a

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.111
lot easier to generate the

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:51.045
political will for the plastic

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.747
bag ban the polystyrene a number

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:54.949
of those initiatives because I

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:57.518
think the population.

01:30:57.585 --> 01:30:59.554
Woken up to taking

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.488
responsibility.

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:03.357
It's interesting China's kind of

01:31:03.424 --> 01:31:04.392
the same thing to us by closing

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.227
those markets.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:08.262
It should be shameful that our

01:31:08.329 --> 01:31:11.265
solutions are shipping things

01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:11.933
off to other countries.

01:31:11.999 --> 01:31:14.001
Adding to their burdens just

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:15.837
because of our convenient.

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:18.773
And so the the current state I'm

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.174
hoping in this is why it's very

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:20.474
good having.

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:21.642
This.

01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:25.513
Waste side focus on this panel

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.981
we had lots of discussions

01:31:27.048 --> 01:31:27.448
around.

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:29.550
Plus the pollution plastic

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:33.254
products plastic is here to stay

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:33.888
I don't think we're getting rid

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:34.288
of it.

01:31:34.355 --> 01:31:36.390
But how we reduce it how we be

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:39.060
responsible across the spectrum

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.195
from manufacturing manufactured

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:43.865
choices distribution choices

01:31:43.931 --> 01:31:44.498
which will have to do with the

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:46.167
packaging and and distribution

01:31:46.234 --> 01:31:47.802
and then end of life.

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.070
And finding a better way for

01:31:49.136 --> 01:31:50.671
everyone to take responsibility

01:31:50.738 --> 01:31:51.706
that's that was.

01:31:51.772 --> 01:31:53.574
Actually the impetus for getting

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:55.676
things done here waking up

01:31:55.743 --> 01:31:56.777
because nobody wanted a landfill

01:31:56.844 --> 01:31:58.412
their backyard.

01:31:58.479 --> 01:31:59.380
And we're going to be shipping

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.681
about a state bearing of stuff

01:32:00.748 --> 01:32:02.383
in the desert who knows what

01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:03.284
which is the all has

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.219
catastrophic consequences.

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.154
And so it's great to see some of

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:09.090
those solutions politically some

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:10.224
of those obviously are going to

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:12.026
be easier.

01:32:12.093 --> 01:32:12.894
Than others but getting

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.962
Californians to understand the

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:16.898
impact of the decisions that

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:17.899
they may.

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:20.701
Have that we can't we we no

01:32:20.768 --> 01:32:22.737
longer have options just to take

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:23.638
that stuff shipped away out of

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.606
sight out of mind the take

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.541
responsibility for what we what

01:32:27.608 --> 01:32:28.442
we use here.

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:31.345
I think will be helpful.

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:33.481
But difficult as we move through

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.449
the process so that they get a I

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.118
think you for offering solutions

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:39.053
and looking at what's possible.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:41.022
And in and the difficult

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.924
conversations of folks have and

01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:44.892
a member with the plastic bag

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.092
band.

01:32:45.159 --> 01:32:47.261
Save our shores was helpful in

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:50.631
putting data medially soon as

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.533
that was proposed so I reduction

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:53.768
in plastic bags in the

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.736
environment long before the

01:32:55.803 --> 01:32:57.471
origins took a fact so again.

01:32:57.538 --> 01:32:59.507
That public education the

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:02.443
discourse has a has its desired

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:05.513
effect and in changing people's

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:06.213
behavior.

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:08.316
So other questions this Friedman

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.017
I have a question I have a

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.052
question about --

01:33:11.118 --> 01:33:14.889
How Santa Cruz does enforcement

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:15.990
with their local ordinances and

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.825
I was thinking again about?

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.694
Being last night at a restaurant

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.629
which is literally on the pier.

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:22.730
And being given without request

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:26.500
plastic straws so it's one thing

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:26.801
to have --

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.402
Businesses that are compliant

01:33:28.469 --> 01:33:29.570
because they want to be but what

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:32.373
do you do about the out liars

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.240
like that and do you have.

01:33:33.307 --> 01:33:35.276
You have some sort of

01:33:35.343 --> 01:33:36.410
enforcement mechanism and how

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:38.212
does that work.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.146
We do.

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:41.148
Of begin by saying in this

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:43.217
particular case although I work

01:33:43.284 --> 01:33:44.885
for the county and the work is

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:45.853
in the city.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.788
I'm going to be contacting my

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.090
colleagues at the city when I

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.625
leave here and left another

01:33:51.692 --> 01:33:52.259
something here for you to follow

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:54.862
up on on and I do that all the

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:55.896
time we do it for each other

01:33:55.963 --> 01:33:57.465
they called me as well.

01:33:57.531 --> 01:34:00.334
All of our ordinances included

01:34:00.401 --> 01:34:02.236
in for spent provisions

01:34:02.303 --> 01:34:05.206
penalties for violations.

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:07.174
Our emphasis is more on

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:09.143
education in compliance when we

01:34:09.210 --> 01:34:11.178
find problems we often learn

01:34:11.245 --> 01:34:13.914
that it's a new employee it's a

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.816
misunderstanding so.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:17.918
Our first step is to try to help

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.754
people comply --

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.789
But but there are sticks in the

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.591
ordinances we can levy

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:26.560
substantial penalties and on the

01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.396
rare occasions where we found

01:34:28.462 --> 01:34:30.364
reluctance the the knowledge of

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:32.199
that has been a powerful

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:33.234
incentive.

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:37.238
We also have another very school

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:38.039
available to us here.

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.273
And that's are very

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.175
environmentally conscious

01:34:41.242 --> 01:34:42.977
residents --

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:44.979
I guarantee you that a lot of

01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:47.715
local people if they stop in

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:49.750
that same residents restaurant.

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:51.685
Going to say what the heck are

01:34:51.752 --> 01:34:52.653
you doing.

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:54.755
This is plastic this is not

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:56.524
allowed you have to deal with

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.526
this right now.

01:34:58.592 --> 01:34:59.427
And a lot of businesses that

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:01.395
would be much more responsive to

01:35:01.462 --> 01:35:03.230
an average customer then they're

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:05.166
going to be to a call for me.

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:06.133
So we use all of those things

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.136
and we really see very high

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:11.939
levels of compliance

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:12.239
[inaudible]

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:13.874
This car.

01:35:13.941 --> 01:35:15.810
Thank you and and thanks the

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.745
presentation --

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:18.746
And I think --

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:21.849
One of the well one of the

01:35:21.916 --> 01:35:23.617
common themes is.

01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:25.486
That.

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:28.389
Local governance local regional

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:30.825
actions are or in some ways kind

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:34.261
of the the pilot programs or the

01:35:34.328 --> 01:35:36.197
the the experimental place where

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:37.198
you can experiment whether it's

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:39.100
just topics working with local

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:39.733
governments trying something out

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:40.101
doesn't work.

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:41.969
Try something different --

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:43.971
And kind of having that

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:44.805
opportunity for the laboratory

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:45.139
but I think.

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:47.708
A lot of the companies that are

01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:49.710
more forward thinking understand

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.612
consumer preference --

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:53.514
And what's coming down the road

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:57.418
and so if they see what's

01:35:57.485 --> 01:35:57.985
happening in Santa Cruz and

01:35:58.052 --> 01:35:59.353
Berkeley.

01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.554
That it's gonna mention

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:03.257
happening in Francisco LA.

01:36:03.324 --> 01:36:04.425
San Jose and its attention

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:08.028
compass in the California and so

01:36:08.095 --> 01:36:10.097
for a smart company will pay

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:11.932
attention as a with a second

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:12.299
this is where.

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:14.902
A ventrally consumer choice is

01:36:14.969 --> 01:36:16.070
going to get as we get more

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.905
educated as people have more

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:18.873
options and choices they're

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:19.840
gonna start making the choices

01:36:19.907 --> 01:36:21.742
that are good for themselves

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:22.042
health wise.

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:23.611
Good for the planet --

01:36:23.677 --> 01:36:25.513
And what have you and so --

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:26.814
Even when we're doing our

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.616
plastic bag and literally being

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:29.750
internet goes this was before it

01:36:29.817 --> 01:36:31.519
was a fact giving reusable bags

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.254
to people and explaining what

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.357
was coming down the road in the

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:38.192
red reality is that people.

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.293
The card that you get some

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.394
postal complain about a little

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:41.295
bit about the initially that

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:41.896
behavior changes.

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:44.865
And then allows the state --

01:36:44.932 --> 01:36:46.100
To use the path that you now

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:47.968
have a couple together a bunch

01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:48.802
of local jurisdictions the now

01:36:48.869 --> 01:36:50.704
create the momentum to do it at

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:51.605
a state level.

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:54.542
And so I really appreciate.

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:55.543
What you're doing?

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:57.545
Here in this region as a really

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:58.746
important laboratory for the

01:36:58.812 --> 01:36:59.446
nation.

01:36:59.513 --> 01:37:02.216
In terms of pushing forward

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:03.317
things that yeah you know what

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:05.119
tomorrow if we introduce in

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.220
Sacramento will go through maybe

01:37:06.287 --> 01:37:07.154
not.

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:09.223
But intentionally because the

01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:11.025
work you're doing allows us as

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:13.928
legislators that.

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:14.862
That certainly.

01:37:14.929 --> 01:37:16.130
You know want to move in the

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:17.765
direction you're going.

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.800
The ability to be able to point

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:21.869
to data point to facts point to

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:23.604
consumer choice --

01:37:23.671 --> 01:37:24.238
In a very meaningful way some

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:25.739
very grateful for that and so

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.441
thank you for that as well as

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:29.510
the industry respect that look

01:37:29.577 --> 01:37:31.245
you know and I think floor as

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.446
question the prior.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:36.483
Panel about spot with those are

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:37.384
all things that we have to be

01:37:37.451 --> 01:37:39.119
cognizant of because if we get

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:41.956
these major retailers is major --

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:42.957
Companies to come on board

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:45.092
that's huge and that creates

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.093
momentum for others jump on

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.962
board because obviously the the

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.697
public publicity.

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.932
And PR and people wanting to do

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.634
the right thing well you know if

01:37:53.701 --> 01:37:54.835
a company like Starbucks gonna

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.736
do then I feel better about

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:57.471
Starbucks and going there as a

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.340
consumer well guess what the

01:37:59.406 --> 01:38:00.307
other companies are charging.

01:38:00.374 --> 01:38:03.177
Too and so knowing the data on

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:06.146
what the cost is to both of the

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:07.248
the companies they're supplying

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:08.182
the products.

01:38:08.249 --> 01:38:10.117
As well as to recyclers and the

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.151
challenges they have because

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.920
it's easy to say always recycle

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:13.887
everything about solve the

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:15.889
problem and and hearing the

01:38:15.956 --> 01:38:17.791
challenges with that helps us

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:19.627
then it would be create policies

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:20.661
a wall.

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:21.929
Of the policies are created were

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:23.530
really good twenty years ago

01:38:23.597 --> 01:38:24.598
they don't actually work today

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:26.433
for the recyclers and other

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:27.501
things that we can do better so

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:28.569
I'm I I think this

01:38:28.636 --> 01:38:30.437
conversation's really helpful.

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:31.338
For me Texas that that think

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:33.307
about and how we move forward as

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:35.142
a state but again encouraging

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.044
that local --

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:42.016
Energy and the the the local

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:44.918
activism is as important. For

01:38:44.985 --> 01:38:45.753
that question about the plastic

01:38:45.819 --> 01:38:47.855
and glass.

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:49.690
They have been studies done.

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:51.625
In in in these studies are

01:38:51.692 --> 01:38:52.660
mostly called life cycle

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:54.461
assessments and life cycle cost

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:54.795
assessments.

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:57.364
In you know often plastic is

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:58.032
going to turn out from the life

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.266
cycle assessment to be the

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:00.467
material of choice it's light

01:39:00.534 --> 01:39:03.203
weight it's an expensive.

01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:05.172
Theoretically it's recyclable

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.173
you put all of those things into

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.242
his study with boundaries that

01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.010
are set by.

01:39:10.077 --> 01:39:12.946
The researcher or that or the

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:13.814
study conductor.

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.849
In you can pretty much get the

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:17.718
answer that you want.

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:19.787
But in terms of plastic verse

01:39:19.853 --> 01:39:23.524
plastic is much later.

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:24.525
Much less expensive.

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:27.394
And so there's been this mass

01:39:27.461 --> 01:39:28.662
migration away from plot glass

01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:30.431
bottles to plastic bottles

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:33.233
because it also reduces

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:35.302
greenhouse gas when you're

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:36.136
transporting.

01:39:36.203 --> 01:39:39.039
You know billions of glass

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:41.008
bottles around the country and

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:42.242
around the globe we're talking

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:45.045
about you know heavy containers

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:45.813
a lot more --

01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:48.248
Energy for transport at center

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:49.750
and the green greenhouse gases

01:39:49.817 --> 01:39:50.684
go up.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:53.554
Would actually require me using

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:57.458
a glass bottle forty times. To

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.426
equal the same greenhouse gas

01:39:59.493 --> 01:40:02.229
level in reductions is using one

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:03.397
plastic bottles you have to

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:07.067
recycle that glass forty we use

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.402
that not recycling actually we

01:40:08.469 --> 01:40:09.002
use it.

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:11.071
And I think the challenge there

01:40:11.138 --> 01:40:11.638
is that we've gone in this

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:14.007
global economy.

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:14.908
When I was a kid I used to take

01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:17.911
my coke bottles yes I drink coke

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:18.812
as a kid?

01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:20.013
I used to take him back to the

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:22.516
corner store put him in a little.

01:40:22.583 --> 01:40:25.386
You know look like a a crate you

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:27.755
know with what's in it for each

01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:29.323
bottle.

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:30.524
And they would take them to see

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:32.226
that local bottling facility

01:40:32.292 --> 01:40:33.627
maybe thirty forty miles away

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:35.496
washed and sterilised them in

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:37.231
you know come back out on the

01:40:37.297 --> 01:40:39.967
market and they all looked can't.

01:40:40.033 --> 01:40:42.836
Cool all scratched up and cloudy

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:45.005
and sort of fun you know.

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:48.742
And no they can't do that

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:49.843
they're about three glass

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.678
manufacturers in the country.

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:52.646
If you were gonna collect glass

01:40:52.713 --> 01:40:54.615
bottles and send them from

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:57.351
Florida to Colorado where there

01:40:57.418 --> 01:40:59.386
is a glass re processor.

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.321
Were talking a lot of money but

01:41:01.388 --> 01:41:04.158
we are seeing some some of the

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.459
local breweries begin to do that

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.161
especially in Colorado where

01:41:07.227 --> 01:41:08.996
they do have a glass facility.

01:41:09.062 --> 01:41:12.065
So they are often the furries

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:14.101
themselves are taking them back

01:41:14.168 --> 01:41:15.803
re watching them in.

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.805
Sterilizing them and putting

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:18.739
them back out on the market but

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:20.874
but the real you know who the

01:41:20.941 --> 01:41:22.676
real.

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:23.610
Issue is greenhouse gasses

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:24.778
associated with the heavier

01:41:24.845 --> 01:41:29.316
materials.

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:31.318
Mr. card sure this.

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:33.220
Couple observations first.

01:41:33.287 --> 01:41:34.521
So you use the examples of John

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:36.290
which you said [inaudible]

01:41:36.356 --> 01:41:40.894
Tom. Ten year old twin girls let

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:42.896
job which is --

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:44.898
And so you know the used to be

01:41:44.965 --> 01:41:45.999
of course this fire phone.

01:41:46.066 --> 01:41:46.733
Containers.

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.870
But and now they transitioned at

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:53.540
as you said but last night.

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:56.577
So you go from really bad day

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:58.512
kind of bad so they don't break

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:00.380
down in that stuck in the sand.

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.349
But there entities that.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.184
Cannot be recycled so.

01:42:04.251 --> 01:42:05.419
I guess that's a win but it's

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:07.087
not.

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:08.021
A perfect --

01:42:08.088 --> 01:42:10.190
So just kind of you have to

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:12.059
remind yourself that by making

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:13.927
this transition from cold stone

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:15.929
the same scenario there from the

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.831
ice cream phone to that.

01:42:17.898 --> 01:42:19.032
Cardboard line thing that's not

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:22.636
recyclable --

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:23.837
And and the issue that we're

01:42:23.904 --> 01:42:25.405
gonna face if.

01:42:25.472 --> 01:42:27.541
Any four of us I'm sure we

01:42:27.608 --> 01:42:28.876
support many measures have not

01:42:28.942 --> 01:42:30.310
offer them ourselves.

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:30.577
Is -- When

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.279
we try to get these things pass

01:42:32.346 --> 01:42:34.281
of the state level as?

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:37.084
Like food containers with other

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:40.087
compostable recyclable.

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:42.122
If the cost passed on to

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:44.825
consumers is going.

01:42:44.892 --> 01:42:45.926
To in our RD raising their gas

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:46.827
taxes and you know and minimum

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:48.962
wage increases and you hear from

01:42:49.029 --> 01:42:50.764
the opposition all these

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.533
arguments left and right.

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:54.568
So how do we respond to that are

01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:56.436
are there any examples for you.

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:58.338
Is how much has that.

01:42:58.405 --> 01:43:02.209
Item of whatever product --

01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:04.144
Gonna.

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:08.115
Cost or has stayed the same.

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:08.949
When we me EMTs efforts?

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.918
That was a concern --

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:11.885
The availability --

01:43:11.952 --> 01:43:14.087
Truly recyclable and compostable

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:15.789
food service products was

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.859
limited the quality was somewhat

01:43:18.926 --> 01:43:19.793
uneven --

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.629
Sometimes the performance left

01:43:22.696 --> 01:43:24.431
something to be desired I

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.533
personally experience putting a

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:31.238
compostable spoon and nobles

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:32.172
super watching and Mel.

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:34.207
We've come a long way.

01:43:34.274 --> 01:43:35.242
I mentioned the rules we

01:43:35.309 --> 01:43:37.077
implemented last year requiring

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:38.979
all of those food service

01:43:39.046 --> 01:43:40.948
materials to be recyclable and

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:41.915
compostable.

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.984
Before we ever talk to the food

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.953
service businesses we talk to

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:47.754
the distributors that the

01:43:47.821 --> 01:43:49.723
wholesalers we let him know that

01:43:49.790 --> 01:43:50.624
this is common.

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.059
Is this going to be a problem

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:55.529
for you we one of them.

01:43:55.596 --> 01:43:57.431
Not a bit.

01:43:57.497 --> 01:43:59.399
This industry has just

01:43:59.466 --> 01:44:00.400
mushroomed.

01:44:00.467 --> 01:44:02.369
There's so many products

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.338
available there are many to

01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:05.138
choose from.

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:07.007
There available for every

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:09.009
conceivable use they perform

01:44:09.076 --> 01:44:09.943
gray.

01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:12.813
And they're very affordable so

01:44:12.879 --> 01:44:14.948
that was an issue years ago but

01:44:15.015 --> 01:44:17.918
but I can confidently say it

01:44:17.985 --> 01:44:22.556
really isn't any longer.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.523
So on the app for example

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:28.362
styrofoam.

01:44:28.428 --> 01:44:30.330
X. poly styrene only.

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.299
Like sorry.

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:33.400
He there are the restaurants

01:44:33.467 --> 01:44:35.068
whether it's you know.

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:36.336
Panda express what have you the

01:44:36.403 --> 01:44:38.939
national chains date counter and

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:40.841
say now that increases --

01:44:40.907 --> 01:44:42.075
The cost to consumers.

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:44.778
So.

01:44:44.845 --> 01:44:46.780
When they come out?

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:47.881
I am and I and I can show you

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:48.949
examples that are just as

01:44:49.016 --> 01:44:50.817
affordable we've we've done the

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.453
homework and I can tell you that

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:55.422
our order supervisors always ask

01:44:55.489 --> 01:44:56.390
that question.

01:44:56.456 --> 01:44:58.325
What's going to be the impact on

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.260
local businesses how is this

01:45:00.327 --> 01:45:02.262
going to affect their class and

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.196
I've learned to do my homework.

01:45:03.263 --> 01:45:04.531
So when I bring a measure

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:07.167
forward like this I'm ready with

01:45:07.234 --> 01:45:09.870
a list of twenty products for or

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:10.904
more.

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:11.171
Learning.

01:45:11.238 --> 01:45:12.305
As well that are readily

01:45:12.372 --> 01:45:14.841
available and don't cost anymore.

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:18.679
So we we hear a lot --

01:45:18.745 --> 01:45:20.647
Predictions.

01:45:20.714 --> 01:45:23.517
There's often --

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:25.419
No accurate information behind

01:45:25.485 --> 01:45:26.586
so they really don't cost me

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:29.256
more money and they are.

01:45:29.322 --> 01:45:31.258
Able to be utilized.

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:33.160
With the consumer in the same.

01:45:33.226 --> 01:45:35.362
Manner not having you know I've

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:37.064
I've.

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.265
I've bought a little --

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:40.834
Pressed use the straws in it

01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:42.202
falls apart after like virus so

01:45:42.269 --> 01:45:43.136
please see you gotta make sure

01:45:43.203 --> 01:45:43.937
you.

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:44.871
So I know they're they're

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:46.873
probably iron in summer better

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:47.874
than other fixing those things

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:48.075
out.

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:48.675
So.

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:50.677
If they really are no cost

01:45:50.744 --> 01:45:52.446
difference why would they not

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:53.447
just to the natural it doesn't

01:45:53.513 --> 01:45:55.549
help these restaurants to be

01:45:55.615 --> 01:45:59.386
using -- The

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.288
single use things that.

01:46:01.354 --> 01:46:03.156
A third maybe of their customers

01:46:03.223 --> 01:46:05.192
look at so you know what I just

01:46:05.258 --> 01:46:06.226
don't like this someone.

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:08.028
Like Starbucks are beginning to

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:08.395
realize that.

01:46:08.462 --> 01:46:09.362
This is not just a way to look

01:46:09.429 --> 01:46:10.897
greener.

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:12.866
Make people happier but it makes

01:46:12.933 --> 01:46:15.702
business sense.

01:46:15.769 --> 01:46:16.870
Inertia is N. issue people are

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:17.971
afraid of change they're used to

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.806
doing things the way that

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:20.841
they've been doing them they've.

01:46:20.907 --> 01:46:22.476
Had these long established

01:46:22.542 --> 01:46:24.544
supply change they don't see any

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:26.313
reason to do it any differently.

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:27.614
And it's while we institute

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:31.251
these men those problems and

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:33.253
offer them solutions up front

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:35.455
because we wanted to be easy for

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:38.959
everybody. For example if I can.

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:41.828
On the six initiatives that we

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:42.863
are taking on currently.

01:46:42.929 --> 01:46:45.732
I am working with for students

01:46:45.799 --> 01:46:46.933
from Middlebury Middlebury

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.669
institute friends International

01:46:49.736 --> 01:46:51.571
Studies and there graduate.

01:46:51.638 --> 01:46:53.440
Sustainability program in there

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:55.575
doing exactly this kind of

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:56.576
research how many companies so

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:59.312
many individual businesses in

01:46:59.379 --> 01:47:01.248
the county or in the city

01:47:01.314 --> 01:47:03.183
jurisdiction will be affected.

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:06.186
By this ordinance will it be a

01:47:06.253 --> 01:47:08.088
cost to them only be a cost

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:10.857
savings are there alternatives

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.025
how easy and they to come.

01:47:12.092 --> 01:47:13.860
About the work we're doing that

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:16.730
research and bringing it forward --

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:18.665
You know one of the reasons

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:20.600
we're likely to see.

01:47:20.667 --> 01:47:23.570
The ban on toiletry bottles that

01:47:23.637 --> 01:47:25.472
we've asked for is because that

01:47:25.539 --> 01:47:28.275
is a cost savings to businesses

01:47:28.341 --> 01:47:30.277
and they've already discovered

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:31.244
some of this on their own and

01:47:31.311 --> 01:47:33.180
are moving in that direction so.

01:47:33.246 --> 01:47:36.216
That's almost a no brainer for

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.118
work for you folks and in the

01:47:38.185 --> 01:47:40.887
legislature to to look at and

01:47:40.954 --> 01:47:42.022
saying we can actually help

01:47:42.088 --> 01:47:42.823
these.

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:44.691
This industry get to cost

01:47:44.758 --> 01:47:47.160
savings faster --

01:47:47.227 --> 01:47:49.696
You know they're the higher end

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:50.931
hotels there have been surveys

01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:51.531
done where.

01:47:51.598 --> 01:47:55.769
They say their customers will

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:59.239
feel if they the luxury of their

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:01.374
own personal product that hasn't

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:04.144
been touched by anybody else but

01:48:04.211 --> 01:48:06.146
you know that's pretty much just

01:48:06.213 --> 01:48:07.080
the really.

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:08.148
Once used Cervantes [inaudible]

01:48:08.215 --> 01:48:09.983
Pretty high.

01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:11.885
And customer in.

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:12.886
Most of them.

01:48:12.953 --> 01:48:14.020
I don't think or even really

01:48:14.087 --> 01:48:15.822
paying attention to it we're

01:48:15.889 --> 01:48:16.790
seeing these kinds of changes

01:48:16.857 --> 01:48:18.859
across most of the hotel chain

01:48:18.925 --> 01:48:21.595
so there.

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:22.629
It.

01:48:22.696 --> 01:48:23.663
On the actual plan think about

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:26.366
80% plus of the hotel motel

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:29.536
owners are south Asian some very

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:35.075
but it is. To turn of

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.409
deregulation into changing their

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:37.110
business models so --

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:38.545
It may take a little bit of time

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:39.379
but again Santa Cruz going first

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:41.781
and working with local hotels

01:48:41.848 --> 01:48:43.016
motels you a lot of to a big

01:48:43.083 --> 01:48:43.817
tourism industry here.

01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:45.886
Helps so much to that have large

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:48.588
conversation with their advocacy

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:49.623
organization.

01:48:49.689 --> 01:48:50.857
And to talk a look they're doing

01:48:50.924 --> 01:48:52.492
it there how can we do this in a

01:48:52.559 --> 01:48:53.493
way that's most would you have

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:54.527
any sense of the it not all

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.696
business of the same so when we

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:57.330
did.

01:48:57.397 --> 01:48:58.632
A poly styrene for take out in

01:48:58.698 --> 01:48:59.366
San Jose we did.

01:48:59.432 --> 01:49:02.269
Plastic bags we had a different

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:04.170
time frame for the larger. One

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:05.505
companies that I've economies of

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:08.975
scale of the the franchises and

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:10.844
the chains had up.

01:49:10.911 --> 01:49:15.048
Had up complies sooner the small

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:18.818
mom and pop so they have not

01:49:18.885 --> 01:49:20.787
save a bridge yeah and so that

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.455
we have any sense of that with

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:23.657
recognize a love these there

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:24.491
that.

01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:25.025
Some of the arguments of

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:26.426
business they're not just all by

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:27.360
you know just all made up just

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.328
to resist change there are

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.462
especially the smaller

01:49:29.529 --> 01:49:30.497
businesses are some.

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.299
Tensions there apps and so

01:49:32.365 --> 01:49:33.533
whatever we can do to kind of

01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.402
smooth it out but make sure we

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.103
don't take steps backward orders

01:49:37.170 --> 01:49:38.438
or stand still that we have to

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:38.905
keep moving.

01:49:38.972 --> 01:49:42.075
Forward and so again I think

01:49:42.142 --> 01:49:42.676
what you're doing is really

01:49:42.742 --> 01:49:42.943
helpful.

01:49:43.009 --> 01:49:44.911
Edits learning experience to for

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:46.746
the businesses when we did the

01:49:46.813 --> 01:49:47.881
original poly styrene bad for

01:49:47.948 --> 01:49:48.615
take out.

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:49.749
There was a great deal of

01:49:49.816 --> 01:49:52.485
concern about existing product

01:49:52.552 --> 01:49:54.454
so we actually built in and

01:49:54.521 --> 01:49:59.192
implementation that was longer

01:49:59.259 --> 01:49:59.826
but we ask them to come back and

01:49:59.893 --> 01:50:00.260
apply [inaudible]

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:01.227
Nobody did.

01:50:01.294 --> 01:50:02.262
So they were able actually to

01:50:02.329 --> 01:50:04.164
shift to the new product much

01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:05.332
more quickly than they thought

01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:07.133
they were and so part of the

01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.101
implementation is giving a

01:50:08.168 --> 01:50:08.902
little bit of leeway

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:09.202
[inaudible]

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:12.906
But working with with some

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.808
parameters that that can work

01:50:14.874 --> 01:50:16.042
and I think the businesses and

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:18.845
so at for future steps that were

01:50:18.912 --> 01:50:20.647
taken those issues didn't arise

01:50:20.714 --> 01:50:21.581
because of the experience.

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:25.352
That the businesses here had and

01:50:25.418 --> 01:50:25.986
they understood that they could

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:27.387
in fact implement.

01:50:27.454 --> 01:50:28.355
And then I would add the in in

01:50:28.421 --> 01:50:30.423
this particular case our very

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:33.159
first step was to meet with the

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.361
local hotel and motel owners

01:50:34.427 --> 01:50:35.095
managers.

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.963
And that's what do you think

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.999
about this how would this affect

01:50:39.065 --> 01:50:39.966
you what kind of problems might

01:50:40.033 --> 01:50:42.068
not be aware of what do you know

01:50:42.135 --> 01:50:43.803
that we don't know.

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:45.005
And we always take that approach

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.673
with on a blind side people we

01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.609
want to find workable solutions.

01:50:49.676 --> 01:50:52.479
At the same time you know like I

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:53.613
said I've spent many years in my

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:55.448
career actually working in

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:56.516
corporate sustainability and

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.351
have consulted to a lot of

01:50:58.418 --> 01:50:59.319
companies you produced.

01:50:59.386 --> 01:51:01.221
Some of the projects that.

01:51:01.287 --> 01:51:02.088
Now on this side of the fence

01:51:02.155 --> 01:51:04.124
I'm.

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:06.026
Looking to help eliminate.

01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.293
But you know at some point where

01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:08.962
we do have to look at the

01:51:09.029 --> 01:51:10.964
economics you know we are our

01:51:11.031 --> 01:51:14.734
world is driven by an economy.

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.036
And arguably it's not the right

01:51:16.102 --> 01:51:18.605
economic model right now but

01:51:18.671 --> 01:51:19.639
when we need to look at that we

01:51:19.706 --> 01:51:21.541
also need to keep.

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:24.511
Firmly planted I think even have

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:26.546
a claim it crisis and we have a

01:51:26.613 --> 01:51:28.281
plastic policing crisis.

01:51:28.348 --> 01:51:31.317
That it won't matter if there

01:51:31.384 --> 01:51:34.220
are businesses or if we have

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:37.057
conveniences if our ocean dice

01:51:37.123 --> 01:51:37.991
we die.

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:39.292
That is our most important

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.860
resource and if we aren't

01:51:40.927 --> 01:51:42.762
willing to step up and make the

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:43.897
hard decisions and forests

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:46.733
businesses from time to time to

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.769
make a hard choice [inaudible]

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:52.572
While hopefully not until after

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.507
I'm dead which is often a

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.443
consolation having use since

01:51:56.509 --> 01:51:58.278
I've been working in this field

01:51:58.344 --> 01:51:59.479
for over thirty years that I'll

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.581
be gone before it's really bad

01:52:01.648 --> 01:52:04.084
but it's going to get really bad

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.385
if we don't make some pretty

01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:08.922
hard choices pretty fast.

01:52:08.988 --> 01:52:09.923
Right.

01:52:09.989 --> 01:52:11.124
I know we were just public

01:52:11.191 --> 01:52:12.859
comment yeah we want you to

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:13.927
overcome it and we were quick

01:52:13.993 --> 01:52:15.728
thing up I want to just notice.

01:52:15.795 --> 01:52:16.629
Make the notion here that.

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:18.598
If we're pushing for more

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:21.501
compostable recycling single use

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.502
products we run into the issue

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:25.405
the recycling history and we're

01:52:25.472 --> 01:52:27.373
gonna have a not I'm vibrant --

01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:28.575
Joining these to select

01:52:28.641 --> 01:52:30.210
committees because they're

01:52:30.276 --> 01:52:31.144
they're intertwined.

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:33.113
Really big hearing --

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:36.316
Nearly twenty eighteen talking

01:52:36.382 --> 01:52:37.217
about this issues [inaudible]

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.819
Select --

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:43.723
But that one of the issues is --

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:45.792
Is this the reality of what's

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:46.693
happening with China in the

01:52:46.759 --> 01:52:48.661
global market so we could push.

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:51.464
All these products to recycling.

01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:55.368
But then if we don't have a way.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:58.271
To have a viable recycling --

01:52:58.338 --> 01:52:59.672
System in California that what

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:01.207
is what is that mean.

01:53:01.274 --> 01:53:07.013
We have stacks of contaminated.

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.982
Alex of contaminated material

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.049
that we can't sell any place

01:53:10.116 --> 01:53:10.917
piling up --

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.051
Merger recovery facilities and

01:53:12.118 --> 01:53:13.987
and getting weathered in getting

01:53:14.053 --> 01:53:15.822
pushed to the point at some

01:53:15.889 --> 01:53:16.356
point in time where it's

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:17.957
weathered it can't be recycled

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.626
at all.

01:53:19.692 --> 01:53:20.860
That's what we've we've really

01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:22.495
seen when China soared initially

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:23.630
had that's leveled out some the

01:53:23.696 --> 01:53:24.497
crisis is.

01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:26.566
Still here but it's it's it's

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:28.401
smaller but that.

01:53:28.468 --> 01:53:29.536
Many like I couldn't see any

01:53:29.602 --> 01:53:31.237
better than you than you did it.

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:32.272
We have to be careful what we

01:53:32.338 --> 01:53:34.174
ask for sometimes and and what

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:35.008
would push into the recycling

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:36.042
stream.

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:37.544
I I guess the best advice I

01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:38.912
could give this let's be really

01:53:38.978 --> 01:53:39.979
good at this it and recycling

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.848
the stuff that is recycle.

01:53:41.915 --> 01:53:43.716
And make those determinations

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:45.051
then try to figure out other

01:53:45.118 --> 01:53:47.754
alternatives to push of the

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:48.021
material.

01:53:48.087 --> 01:53:50.690
Street and good point okay so

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:51.558
thank you for your patience.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.459
Select committee process is a

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:54.527
way of getting information

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:56.329
that's what we have the panels

01:53:56.396 --> 01:53:58.264
into the legislative contacts.

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.133
So now is your opportunity is

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.301
members of the public to breast

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.136
to address us briefly your

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:04.070
comments.

01:54:04.137 --> 01:54:07.040
And we take all of this and for

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:08.007
we'll.

01:54:08.074 --> 01:54:09.876
On the slick committee websites

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:10.877
will try to post --

01:54:10.944 --> 01:54:11.778
Power points in as much

01:54:11.844 --> 01:54:12.946
information as we can so it

01:54:13.012 --> 01:54:14.814
becomes publicly available.

01:54:14.881 --> 01:54:17.717
As education for us as well as

01:54:17.784 --> 01:54:19.619
for our colleague so if anyone

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:20.653
would like to addresses.

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:23.389
This is your opportunity Nicole

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:28.328
has the microphone.

01:54:28.394 --> 01:54:31.197
Good morning this is doctor cold

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:31.831
executive director of Cochran

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.166
product stewardship council --

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:35.168
I want to touch on the Starbucks

01:54:35.235 --> 01:54:35.835
items I thought that was pretty

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:36.035
in.

01:54:36.102 --> 01:54:37.170
That a year and a half ago we

01:54:37.237 --> 01:54:38.905
had discussions with a company

01:54:38.972 --> 01:54:41.808
that was creating a silica based

01:54:41.874 --> 01:54:42.008
wind.

01:54:42.075 --> 01:54:43.710
Paper Cup they approached

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:45.845
Starbucks as an alternative to

01:54:45.912 --> 01:54:47.647
the classic wine.

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:48.948
And the biggest problem

01:54:49.015 --> 01:54:51.718
Starbucks love the bill of the

01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:52.318
idea that the biggest problem

01:54:52.385 --> 01:54:52.518
was.

01:54:52.585 --> 01:54:53.453
They couldn't.

01:54:53.519 --> 01:54:55.355
Get enough of a made.

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:57.423
It was a demand problem is.

01:54:57.490 --> 01:55:00.326
Scalability and so and I and I

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:02.128
suspect now they finally figured

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.263
it out in this weather able

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.197
rolled out nationwide vertical

01:55:04.264 --> 01:55:07.166
while. To get that rolled out so

01:55:07.233 --> 01:55:10.036
I'm glad to see if get witness

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.904
plus going cut --

01:55:11.971 --> 01:55:12.805
So --

look at it as absolutely have

01:55:23.783 --> 01:55:25.685
manufactures dealing with these

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:27.387
products that end of life health

01:55:27.453 --> 01:55:29.155
and agree. To by a greener

01:55:29.222 --> 01:55:32.592
design and will have a better

01:55:32.659 --> 01:55:33.126
product overall at the end

01:55:33.192 --> 01:55:33.426
[inaudible]

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.994
Thank you.

01:55:35.061 --> 01:55:39.932
Others raise your hands.

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:40.867
Hi -- So

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.969
this conversation has been

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:45.972
focused on the individual

01:55:46.039 --> 01:55:46.739
consumer.

01:55:46.806 --> 01:55:49.642
Of as far as what we should do.

01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:52.412
What about --

01:55:52.478 --> 01:55:55.348
Is a large usage of plastics a

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:58.384
with AG every time I go past the

01:55:58.451 --> 01:55:59.585
fields and see that they're

01:55:59.652 --> 01:56:01.287
covered with plastic that our

01:56:01.354 --> 01:56:03.156
food is growing.

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.058
In plastic.

01:56:05.124 --> 01:56:07.994
Of the medical waste industry is

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.862
enormous.

01:56:09.929 --> 01:56:13.733
Of and electronics ayes

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:14.834
something it is filled with

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.803
plastic and we're not going to

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:19.572
not use electronics.

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:22.475
We're not gonna not buy.

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:23.843
Foods that are grown in all this

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.611
plastic but what's being done in

01:56:25.678 --> 01:56:28.247
our their figures comparing

01:56:28.314 --> 01:56:29.215
where --

01:56:29.282 --> 01:56:33.052
That volume of waste such as AG

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.954
medical industry and electronics

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:38.858
with -- What

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:41.828
consumers use safer takeout and

01:56:41.894 --> 01:56:42.929
plastic bags and?

01:56:42.995 --> 01:56:47.600
Bottles.

01:56:47.667 --> 01:56:49.469
Thanks action reaction is what

01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:51.504
what are you doing.

01:56:51.571 --> 01:56:53.506
About those more.

01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:56.275
What if your to me to be harder

01:56:56.342 --> 01:56:56.909
I don't know if they are larger

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:58.211
not?

01:56:58.277 --> 01:57:02.148
Thank you yeah --

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:03.149
Good afternoon --

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:04.183
My name is Jeff Chester I'm

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:06.052
representing Oceania Oceania is

01:57:06.119 --> 01:57:08.921
the largest conservation group --

01:57:08.988 --> 01:57:10.056
Internationally that is what

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.924
will focus specifically and

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:13.893
exclusively on oceans ands and

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:15.628
we're we're actually working on

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:18.731
launching a global plastics --

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:20.533
Campaign --

01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:22.435
And and actually Blake --

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:23.002
And I are here at the local

01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:25.471
level region both in --

01:57:25.538 --> 01:57:27.306
Monterey as were based --

01:57:27.373 --> 01:57:28.474
I also in the Monterey Bay

01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:31.144
charter school ocean garden --

01:57:31.210 --> 01:57:32.211
Guardian coordinator --

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:33.112
Through the no --

01:57:33.179 --> 01:57:34.046
National marine sanctuaries

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:36.048
program where the school in in

01:57:36.115 --> 01:57:37.950
Monterey has actually made a

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:38.518
three year commitment to go

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:40.920
towards zero waste as a school --

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:42.755
And the kids are are extremely

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.657
excited about it the kids get it

01:57:44.724 --> 01:57:46.559
right away and it's the parents

01:57:46.626 --> 01:57:50.463
we got to worry about --

01:57:50.530 --> 01:57:51.030
Six are obviously a a huge

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:51.798
problem for all the reasons

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:53.366
people talk about I think we'd

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.667
like to see kind of a an effort

01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:56.269
to move away from just the idea

01:57:56.335 --> 01:57:58.337
of disposable idea products in

01:57:58.404 --> 01:57:59.238
general --

01:57:59.305 --> 01:58:00.173
Ends in --

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.208
Ultimately the the issue of of

01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:04.210
production and it had hit

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:05.211
tackling not is is certainly the

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.112
big -- One

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:07.880
where we are we're in the U. K.

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:09.248
or and the and the your and in

01:58:09.315 --> 01:58:10.783
Europe that they're now tackling

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.785
it this problem in a

01:58:12.852 --> 01:58:13.786
comprehensive way rather than

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.821
just looking at kind of one

01:58:14.887 --> 01:58:15.788
product at a time.

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.657
They're doing a comprehensive --

01:58:17.723 --> 01:58:19.592
Of solution or package that

01:58:19.659 --> 01:58:21.494
includes both in the phase outs

01:58:21.561 --> 01:58:22.662
of specific worst offender

01:58:22.728 --> 01:58:24.497
single use products as well as

01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:26.299
mandatory reductions and others

01:58:26.365 --> 01:58:28.201
as well as financial incentives

01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:29.435
to bring on more durables and

01:58:29.502 --> 01:58:31.137
reusable materials.

01:58:31.204 --> 01:58:33.172
And so you'll California has a

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.041
history of doing comprehensive

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:36.242
legislation like --

01:58:36.309 --> 01:58:38.277
Assembly bill thirty two to

01:58:38.344 --> 01:58:40.813
address climate in legacy of

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.814
California --

01:58:41.881 --> 01:58:43.149
But so far the plastics work

01:58:43.216 --> 01:58:44.750
well we have made some aye thing

01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:45.952
major progress and emerge as a

01:58:46.018 --> 01:58:48.554
leader in some areas it has been

01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:49.088
too piecemeal and it is

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:50.656
insufficient given the growth of

01:58:50.723 --> 01:58:51.491
the problem.

01:58:51.557 --> 01:58:53.659
And so we are are hoping to work --

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:55.495
And come together with various

01:58:55.561 --> 01:58:56.429
NGOs -- Very

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:58.564
various businesses and hoping to

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.166
see more of a coordinated effort

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:02.268
in the California legislature to

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:03.069
try to take a comprehensive

01:59:03.135 --> 01:59:05.972
approach to to these issues --

01:59:06.038 --> 01:59:07.006
And and really didn't use the

01:59:07.073 --> 01:59:08.941
momentum that's building now to

01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:09.509
get more serious about this

01:59:09.575 --> 01:59:10.977
problem so thank you for keeping

01:59:11.043 --> 01:59:12.778
an eye on your agenda and we are

01:59:12.845 --> 01:59:14.046
we're here to help in this fight

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:21.420
thank you very much.

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:22.622
Hi good afternoon my class of

01:59:22.688 --> 01:59:24.290
environmental organization

01:59:24.357 --> 01:59:26.392
Californians against waste. For

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.560
someone committee for having

01:59:27.627 --> 01:59:29.328
this hearing you've done a

01:59:29.395 --> 01:59:31.097
amazing job of keeping the

01:59:31.163 --> 01:59:32.231
drumbeat going both in the

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:34.033
legislative action you've taken.

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:35.968
This past year in the last few

01:59:36.035 --> 01:59:38.905
years and then having hearings

01:59:38.971 --> 01:59:42.008
and briefings and other things

01:59:42.074 --> 01:59:43.643
in Sacramento.

01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:45.144
I I think to to my to the point

01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:47.680
of my colleague from Oceania.

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:48.981
We need to start looking at this

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:51.484
comprehensively.

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.452
We have a very big problem that

01:59:53.519 --> 01:59:55.388
seems intractable.

01:59:55.454 --> 01:59:57.356
And the way we handle these

01:59:57.423 --> 02:00:00.159
intractable problems is through

02:00:00.226 --> 02:00:02.094
comprehensive policies.

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:05.264
And I it's more or less told the

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:06.198
comments right I my mouth.

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:07.967
But I think we as a society as a

02:00:08.034 --> 02:00:09.902
state need to start saying.

02:00:09.969 --> 02:00:11.771
We can't have an infinite growth

02:00:11.837 --> 02:00:13.839
and disposal plastics.

02:00:13.906 --> 02:00:15.808
We need to cap them out of

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.777
classic we generate and reduce

02:00:17.843 --> 02:00:18.578
that over time.

02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:21.647
And you know it's it's the

02:00:21.714 --> 02:00:22.415
timing of this hearing.

02:00:22.481 --> 02:00:25.284
Is really appropriate --

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:26.319
Given that.

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:28.454
Kind three major news stories in

02:00:28.521 --> 02:00:31.090
the past week --

02:00:31.157 --> 02:00:31.691
One of the stories was about a

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:32.992
week ago when they announced

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:35.027
that they test the table salt.

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:36.495
In 90% of the table salt they

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:39.966
tested had micro plastic.

02:00:40.032 --> 02:00:40.967
A couple days ago there was ever

02:00:41.033 --> 02:00:42.802
a researcher that an ounce a the

02:00:42.868 --> 02:00:43.769
taste tested --

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:46.772
Stool samples and found 1100% of

02:00:46.839 --> 02:00:48.541
the stool samples.

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:49.542
How plastic?

02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:52.478
Which might actually kind of be

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:53.746
good news because at least a

02:00:53.813 --> 02:00:55.348
fleeting the system.

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:56.449
And then the news today coming

02:00:56.515 --> 02:00:57.550
out of Europe is that they just

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.118
adopted a comprehensive

02:00:59.185 --> 02:01:02.054
framework. To phase out the use

02:01:02.121 --> 02:01:04.156
of of single use products that

02:01:04.223 --> 02:01:05.992
have alternatives.

02:01:06.058 --> 02:01:08.361
And setting up a framework to

02:01:08.427 --> 02:01:09.929
reduce the ones that don't.

02:01:09.996 --> 02:01:11.230
And so I think there's a lot

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:12.999
more work to do but it's it's a

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:13.599
lot easier to do nothing and I

02:01:13.666 --> 02:01:15.801
commend you having this

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:17.803
conversation and for keeping a

02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:18.170
dialogue going.

02:01:18.237 --> 02:01:23.409
Thank you.

02:01:23.476 --> 02:01:24.777
Good afternoon thank you so much

02:01:24.844 --> 02:01:26.379
for having this conference today

02:01:26.445 --> 02:01:27.380
my name is Rachel cap and I'm

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:28.347
environmental projects

02:01:28.414 --> 02:01:29.482
coordinator for the city of

02:01:29.548 --> 02:01:30.282
what's involved.

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:33.085
I've to comments about the trash

02:01:33.152 --> 02:01:35.054
provision first as my

02:01:35.121 --> 02:01:35.888
understanding of the trash

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:37.890
provision how we are to quantify

02:01:37.957 --> 02:01:39.859
the water quality benefits of

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:41.994
reducing trash that end up in a

02:01:42.061 --> 02:01:42.728
receiving waters.

02:01:42.795 --> 02:01:44.063
So it seems to me that something

02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:44.997
that we should really be

02:01:45.064 --> 02:01:46.666
focusing on are the types of

02:01:46.732 --> 02:01:48.601
persistent plastics that have

02:01:48.668 --> 02:01:49.769
chemicals that here to them.

02:01:49.835 --> 02:01:51.570
Or leach chemicals into our

02:01:51.637 --> 02:01:53.472
water such as cigarette* or

02:01:53.539 --> 02:01:55.408
agricultural plastics that carry

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:56.542
the methyl bromide or other

02:01:56.609 --> 02:01:58.277
kinds of pollutants I'm out

02:01:58.344 --> 02:01:59.445
encourage that that be something

02:01:59.512 --> 02:02:02.314
that we look at as we go through

02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.050
our trash man that.

02:02:04.116 --> 02:02:05.918
Secondly I am now working on

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:06.919
coordinating that at best

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:07.953
management practices for our

02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:10.189
trash provision it kind of feels

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:10.923
like throwing spaghetti at a

02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:12.758
wall and hoping that.

02:02:12.825 --> 02:02:13.859
Other departments and divisions

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:16.629
within the city feel committed

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:17.596
to our storm water program --

02:02:17.663 --> 02:02:19.432
Primarily that has been a public

02:02:19.498 --> 02:02:21.567
works AB really heavy hitting

02:02:21.634 --> 02:02:23.335
area of so I would also

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:24.603
encourage the state to think

02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:27.239
about ways to include our police

02:02:27.306 --> 02:02:29.241
or are parks and and make sure

02:02:29.308 --> 02:02:30.309
that we're looking at it and a

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:31.310
city wide scale including

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:32.078
enforcement.

02:02:32.144 --> 02:02:34.980
And code at enforcement is a

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.949
huge issue in Watsonville and

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:38.084
last but certainly not least I

02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:39.919
wanted to speak to the

02:02:39.985 --> 02:02:40.820
inclusivity of this movement.

02:02:40.886 --> 02:02:42.788
Specifically to any wall from

02:02:42.855 --> 02:02:44.590
reaching out to the disability

02:02:44.657 --> 02:02:46.659
community related to straws --

02:02:46.726 --> 02:02:48.794
And to think about that with

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:49.528
south county so.

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:52.398
I'm a 100% on board with banning

02:02:52.465 --> 02:02:54.300
bottled water but we have people

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:55.401
in our community who have come

02:02:55.468 --> 02:02:56.569
from places where you can't

02:02:56.635 --> 02:02:57.436
drink the water and so is to

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:59.438
think of our community as being

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:00.139
able to just immediately.

02:03:00.206 --> 02:03:02.675
Get rid of it you know we're not

02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:05.010
the community that's

02:03:05.077 --> 02:03:06.212
significantly a challenge for us

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:08.047
so for us to really invite our

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.281
whole community when we look at

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:10.850
issues like these.

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:11.417
And I really appreciate that

02:03:11.484 --> 02:03:17.590
thank you --

02:03:17.656 --> 02:03:18.657
High -- My

02:03:18.724 --> 02:03:20.526
name's George on and chief

02:03:20.593 --> 02:03:20.860
scientist --

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:21.861
Edition its service to live here

02:03:21.927 --> 02:03:22.795
in Santa Cruz I want to pick up

02:03:22.862 --> 02:03:25.331
on what Jeff said --

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.299
Thank you mark for hosting this --

02:03:27.366 --> 02:03:30.169
This panel this is critical.

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:32.238
And energy Conservancy we worked

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:33.372
worked on this issue for a

02:03:33.439 --> 02:03:34.106
number of years and a lot of

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:35.107
beach cleanups but we've

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.175
increasingly been focused on the

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.877
question of waste management.

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.111
And farther up the chain where

02:03:39.178 --> 02:03:40.746
the materials are coming from

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:42.815
and it is absolutely critical to

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:43.883
have the recycling industry in

02:03:43.949 --> 02:03:45.017
the room but the one group of

02:03:45.084 --> 02:03:46.552
folks that are not in this

02:03:46.619 --> 02:03:47.686
conversation right now are the

02:03:47.753 --> 02:03:49.455
producers of the materials the

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:50.489
world talking about.

02:03:50.556 --> 02:03:51.423
At the end of the day the

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:52.591
fundamental problem with

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.360
plastics is it's not worth very

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:56.395
much you see that coming through

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:58.330
the recycling community it's the

02:03:58.397 --> 02:04:00.199
reason that it's easier to use

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:01.233
plastic and glass or other

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.101
things.

02:04:02.168 --> 02:04:03.202
And so we fundamentally have to

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:06.071
get this question of the cost

02:04:06.138 --> 02:04:07.940
and the value of plastics and

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:09.809
ultimately I think that brings

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:10.276
us back to corporate

02:04:10.342 --> 02:04:11.877
responsibility an extended

02:04:11.944 --> 02:04:12.745
producer responsibility.

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:14.146
And I think you'll be really

02:04:14.213 --> 02:04:15.714
great if we could figure out a

02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:16.882
re way to reset that

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:18.517
conversation my understanding

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:19.552
and I'm no expert.

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:22.688
Is that has become very toxic in

02:04:22.755 --> 02:04:25.224
this country the responsibility

02:04:25.291 --> 02:04:26.492
in the context of plastics and

02:04:26.559 --> 02:04:28.227
ocean health would be really

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:29.495
nice way to kind of reset the

02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:30.162
conversation.

02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:31.397
And figure out and really

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:33.098
practical ways what is our

02:04:33.165 --> 02:04:35.100
shared responsibility and what

02:04:35.167 --> 02:04:36.936
is the private sector's

02:04:37.002 --> 02:04:38.838
responsibility here in solving

02:04:38.904 --> 02:04:39.905
this problem so I'd encourage

02:04:39.972 --> 02:04:40.506
you to go for to think about

02:04:40.573 --> 02:04:40.940
that way [inaudible]

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:43.676
Thank you.

02:04:43.742 --> 02:04:47.580
Right no one else.

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:48.180
Hey signal closing thoughts

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:49.481
members.

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.684
Well just getting back to the

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:54.520
idea of cost and value you know

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:55.254
earlier --

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:58.157
We heard the discussion about

02:04:58.224 --> 02:05:01.060
the cost municipalities of

02:05:01.126 --> 02:05:02.995
having to clean up.

02:05:03.062 --> 02:05:04.964
Through filtration --

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:06.265
The material that's going

02:05:06.332 --> 02:05:07.867
through their community through

02:05:07.933 --> 02:05:10.803
storm drains and streams.

02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:13.839
And yet that cost which is being

02:05:13.906 --> 02:05:15.641
paid for by taxpayers and

02:05:15.708 --> 02:05:17.476
ratepayers is not calculated

02:05:17.543 --> 02:05:19.545
when we talk about the cost to

02:05:19.612 --> 02:05:22.414
let's say business.

02:05:22.481 --> 02:05:23.449
And so re framing --

02:05:23.515 --> 02:05:25.484
How we think of these I think is

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:26.452
really important something that

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:27.486
USCIS policy makers can maybe

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.221
help?

02:05:29.288 --> 02:05:30.256
Figure out a way to do in right

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.191
now Los Angeles is in the

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:35.094
process of voting on measure W.

02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:37.963
which is a parcel tax for storm

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.831
water clean out.

02:05:38.898 --> 02:05:39.431
And a lot of people say but I

02:05:39.498 --> 02:05:44.637
didn't because shin so --

02:05:44.703 --> 02:05:46.672
There's a real inequity to how

02:05:46.739 --> 02:05:47.606
the costs --

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:49.508
It really are being borne by

02:05:49.575 --> 02:05:50.743
society you know particularly

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:53.412
cities that --

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:56.415
A our coastal cities and have to

02:05:56.482 --> 02:05:58.150
pay a bigger burden of costs

02:05:58.217 --> 02:05:59.251
because they're the ones that

02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:00.419
are interacting with the ocean

02:06:00.486 --> 02:06:02.087
in a different way.

02:06:02.154 --> 02:06:03.055
So -- Trying

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:04.023
to help --

02:06:04.089 --> 02:06:06.191
Re adjust that and show those

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.860
true cost like you were talking

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.762
about because the amount of

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:10.996
carbon coming out of trucks

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:12.898
transporting glass but there's

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.733
new data emerging about the

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:15.968
amount of greenhouse gases that

02:06:16.035 --> 02:06:16.602
leak leak.

02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:18.537
Out of plastic bottles and

02:06:18.604 --> 02:06:19.471
that's never been calculated

02:06:19.538 --> 02:06:21.507
before so making sure that we

02:06:21.573 --> 02:06:23.275
have a really holistic --

02:06:23.342 --> 02:06:24.510
View of the costs and that the

02:06:24.576 --> 02:06:27.179
costs are being --

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:29.248
Equitably dispersed --

02:06:29.315 --> 02:06:32.051
And I think that the the

02:06:32.117 --> 02:06:33.018
manufacturing industry.

02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:34.887
They understand that where

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.021
they're way ahead of us and

02:06:36.088 --> 02:06:37.823
that's why you see.

02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:39.058
Reactions to things like

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.693
tethering bottle caps which

02:06:40.759 --> 02:06:41.794
would seem like such a no

02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.729
brainer to so many of us become

02:06:43.796 --> 02:06:45.698
huge bottles in Sacramento or a

02:06:45.764 --> 02:06:47.766
plastic bag ban or whatever else

02:06:47.833 --> 02:06:48.534
it is.

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:52.471
So I I do think that it is --

02:06:52.538 --> 02:06:53.372
Really -- An

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:55.274
imperative of the legislature to

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:56.375
try to get a better

02:06:56.442 --> 02:06:57.242
understanding of all of that.

02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:59.111
And it's great to see so many

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:01.180
people being activated --

02:07:01.246 --> 02:07:02.348
And I will say it's a lot easier

02:07:02.414 --> 02:07:04.950
for people in the coast who.

02:07:05.017 --> 02:07:06.285
Through education understand the

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.120
issues but also see it in their

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:09.922
backyards it's very different

02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.757
story if you're talking about

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:13.792
going into other areas of the

02:07:13.859 --> 02:07:14.793
state that don't interact as

02:07:14.860 --> 02:07:16.595
much with the coastline.

02:07:16.662 --> 02:07:19.465
That I have their own economic

02:07:19.531 --> 02:07:21.567
that costs for them is a much

02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:23.369
higher percentage of their

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:25.304
everyday lives so it hurts more.

02:07:25.371 --> 02:07:26.605
For them to deal with an issue

02:07:26.672 --> 02:07:28.474
that they see is very far away

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:30.109
and remote.

02:07:30.175 --> 02:07:32.277
I don't understand so I I just

02:07:32.344 --> 02:07:33.245
put that out of some of the

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:35.948
challenges that we all have to

02:07:36.015 --> 02:07:36.915
try to deal with when we put

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.917
these policies forward and be

02:07:38.984 --> 02:07:40.886
very aware of I'm at the same

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:41.720
time.

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.822
As you so eloquently said we

02:07:43.889 --> 02:07:46.658
can't let that stop us because

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:47.726
the survival of you know our

02:07:47.793 --> 02:07:50.396
planet is really at stake in

02:07:50.462 --> 02:07:51.597
that sounds very dramatic.

02:07:51.663 --> 02:07:55.200
But it's also true so --

02:07:55.267 --> 02:07:57.369
I I do think that it's important

02:07:57.436 --> 02:07:58.337
to have these conversations and

02:07:58.404 --> 02:07:59.338
to try to kind of spread the

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:01.240
message and I'm so glad to see

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.174
National Geographic I just.

02:08:02.241 --> 02:08:04.376
Doing that I just wish more

02:08:04.443 --> 02:08:05.911
people actually read it --

02:08:05.978 --> 02:08:07.813
But getting that message out

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.081
there is something that

02:08:09.148 --> 02:08:09.815
California that when we bring

02:08:09.882 --> 02:08:11.884
these policies forward even if

02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:12.951
they fail we've started that

02:08:13.018 --> 02:08:14.653
conversation.

02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:15.521
You know having the conversation

02:08:15.587 --> 02:08:16.789
about straws made a lot of

02:08:16.855 --> 02:08:17.823
people start thing about

02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.458
structure ruling.

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:20.659
And about plastic differently I

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:22.327
bet you anything that the market

02:08:22.394 --> 02:08:23.462
for metal straws was instantly

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:25.230
created you know which has its

02:08:25.297 --> 02:08:26.165
own.

02:08:26.231 --> 02:08:30.135
Of positive economic aside again

02:08:30.202 --> 02:08:32.037
shirt chair stone and McCarty

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:33.238
for having this for allowing us

02:08:33.305 --> 02:08:34.206
to participate I've learned a

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:36.075
lot today I want to thank all

02:08:36.141 --> 02:08:38.010
the panelists on that was so

02:08:38.077 --> 02:08:38.877
fast that I kept taking slides.

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.045
And sending them off my poor

02:08:40.112 --> 02:08:42.648
legislative director --

02:08:42.714 --> 02:08:44.850
But will be you know streaming

02:08:44.917 --> 02:08:46.718
this on all of our social media

02:08:46.785 --> 02:08:47.719
sites in trying to spread the

02:08:47.786 --> 02:08:49.555
word and I I really want to

02:08:49.621 --> 02:08:50.522
thank just the members of the

02:08:50.589 --> 02:08:51.523
public in the activists who do

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:53.292
this you know out of passion and

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:53.525
love --

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:55.394
Every single day because your

02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:57.296
work is I think starting to to

02:08:57.362 --> 02:09:01.133
turn the tide so thanks again.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:04.103
Thank you notice.

02:09:04.169 --> 02:09:05.170
There are yeah is one of the one

02:09:05.237 --> 02:09:07.005
at the moment thank you as chair

02:09:07.072 --> 02:09:08.807
stone Chen McCarty is as well as

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:10.742
a colleague summer.

02:09:10.809 --> 02:09:11.710
Or Friedman --

02:09:11.777 --> 02:09:12.978
And I really also want to thank

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:14.613
the panelists I got a lot

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:15.581
information today --

02:09:15.647 --> 02:09:17.649
Of it's it's great to be able to

02:09:17.716 --> 02:09:19.451
do this we're not in session.

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:20.619
Of only really have the time to

02:09:20.686 --> 02:09:22.387
let it -- To

02:09:22.454 --> 02:09:22.955
absorb the information think

02:09:23.021 --> 02:09:25.290
about it --

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:28.127
In and so it's a totally helpful

02:09:28.193 --> 02:09:30.028
and I think that --

02:09:30.095 --> 02:09:32.064
You know when it comes.

02:09:32.131 --> 02:09:33.065
To quirk responsibility when it

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:35.033
comes to what we can do is read

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:37.069
as a legislature when it comes

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:38.871
to consumer choice.

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:39.838
I think that what we were that

02:09:39.905 --> 02:09:41.840
these kinds of conversations

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:44.576
help to build a momentum.

02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:45.711
As alluded to but assembly

02:09:45.777 --> 02:09:47.746
Friedman with the apple plus

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:48.847
extras in just having people

02:09:48.914 --> 02:09:49.948
talk about and then start making

02:09:50.015 --> 02:09:51.383
their own choices.

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:52.417
Also adding the young people are

02:09:52.484 --> 02:09:53.385
gonna save us once again I think

02:09:53.452 --> 02:09:55.187
that you tend to see them.

02:09:55.254 --> 02:09:56.288
Carrying around water bottles

02:09:56.355 --> 02:09:58.157
much more and be more topple

02:09:58.223 --> 02:10:00.359
about this but we need to put in

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:01.093
place.

02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:02.194
Of the environment --

02:10:02.261 --> 02:10:03.962
To create that behavior change

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:05.864
amongst all of us but especially

02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:07.299
our corporate partners that

02:10:07.366 --> 02:10:09.835
really needed. To step up and so

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:12.671
I think that --

02:10:12.738 --> 02:10:14.573
This is been very helpful for me

02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:16.942
and again to the chairs for

02:10:17.009 --> 02:10:19.411
organizing this.

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:21.380
Sure yeah thank you again I that

02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:22.581
I know that this was an issue

02:10:22.648 --> 02:10:23.282
that --

02:10:23.348 --> 02:10:25.551
We've been talking about in the

02:10:25.617 --> 02:10:26.351
natural resources policy

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:28.153
committee legislation.

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:30.189
Later plastic waste and

02:10:30.255 --> 02:10:31.023
recycling I think is important

02:10:31.089 --> 02:10:33.025
to have it together is certainly

02:10:33.091 --> 02:10:33.959
was in lightning.

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:35.127
I to was --

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.829
Excited see the graduate

02:10:37.896 --> 02:10:38.764
students here they del.

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:39.932
Went back to class --

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:42.000
Hopefully they'll be part of the

02:10:42.067 --> 02:10:42.701
solution --

02:10:42.768 --> 02:10:43.802
Bringing some --

02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:45.837
Remedies for us to to tackle --

02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:48.440
Going forward and I I do think

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:49.441
that there is a social

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:50.375
consciousness going.

02:10:50.442 --> 02:10:52.477
Not not just dinner here in

02:10:52.544 --> 02:10:54.246
Santa Cruz but across California

02:10:54.313 --> 02:10:55.581
but even in areas that don't

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:57.182
necessarily.

02:10:57.249 --> 02:10:59.318
See the beautiful coastline

02:10:59.384 --> 02:11:02.988
everyday to to know you know.

02:11:03.055 --> 02:11:03.956
My little --

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:05.290
Fourth grader a couple years ago

02:11:05.357 --> 02:11:09.895
to little project on on on on on

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:11.730
on the impact of a plastic in

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:12.965
the ocean into me to go to the

02:11:13.031 --> 02:11:13.732
store and buy.

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:16.468
The six pack thinks for the

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.769
plastic thing but on the beard

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.705
that fix whatever Kansas so

02:11:19.771 --> 02:11:20.405
forth.

02:11:20.472 --> 02:11:21.506
And so she had a little turtle

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:24.543
in her room and she put through

02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:26.211
their chance little.

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:27.179
An eight year old thinking about

02:11:27.246 --> 02:11:28.080
these things and it's just --

02:11:28.146 --> 02:11:30.182
It's very very powerful and I

02:11:30.249 --> 02:11:31.984
think it's important that we

02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:32.884
focus on the next generation

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.086
because they're the ones that

02:11:34.152 --> 02:11:36.021
will be here.

02:11:36.088 --> 02:11:37.789
After us so --

02:11:37.856 --> 02:11:38.824
Today give us --

02:11:38.890 --> 02:11:40.792
Basically a stark reminder of

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.794
what the issues are today in

02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:44.696
California across the globe but

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:45.564
also.

02:11:45.631 --> 02:11:47.766
Some hope and some remedies from

02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:48.500
the local level --

02:11:48.567 --> 02:11:50.569
That we can bring about through

02:11:50.636 --> 02:11:52.404
the rest of California so --

02:11:52.471 --> 02:11:54.373
Look for to work with all you

02:11:54.439 --> 02:11:56.308
and future thank you.

02:11:56.375 --> 02:11:59.077
Thank you and just to briefly I

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:00.112
think some of the synergies the

02:12:00.178 --> 02:12:02.147
comments that are there.

02:12:02.214 --> 02:12:04.016
The question really is the

02:12:04.082 --> 02:12:06.852
larger question so lot of the

02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:07.819
industrial agricultural are

02:12:07.886 --> 02:12:09.888
significant piece of it most of

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:11.657
the thin film is is in fact

02:12:11.723 --> 02:12:13.759
agricultural and industrial.

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:15.594
We just we had.

02:12:15.661 --> 02:12:17.462
Limited time but those are

02:12:17.529 --> 02:12:19.631
really also part of what the

02:12:19.698 --> 02:12:20.432
broader conversation is

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:22.668
electronic disposal all of that

02:12:22.734 --> 02:12:23.735
a lot of local jurisdictions are

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:25.537
taking on I think I would

02:12:25.604 --> 02:12:27.239
completely agree I think most of

02:12:27.306 --> 02:12:28.106
us agree.

02:12:28.173 --> 02:12:29.308
About this notion of extended

02:12:29.374 --> 02:12:32.010
produce responsibility.

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:33.078
That's one of the reasons were

02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:34.913
holding these is.

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:36.782
To broaden what we know bring

02:12:36.848 --> 02:12:37.849
more people into the

02:12:37.916 --> 02:12:39.685
conversation right now anything

02:12:39.751 --> 02:12:40.786
we do in the legislature that

02:12:40.852 --> 02:12:42.621
CPR is a two thirds vote.

02:12:42.688 --> 02:12:45.590
At mosa plastic stuff we can't

02:12:45.657 --> 02:12:46.525
even get.

02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:48.560
Forty one votes in our own house

02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:52.297
so our steps are dramatic and we

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.199
need to engage more broadly

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:55.233
engage with the industry gauge.

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:57.436
Where we can to look for

02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:59.104
solutions that ultimately are

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:01.239
implementable that's one of the

02:13:01.306 --> 02:13:02.941
reasons the legislature does

02:13:03.008 --> 02:13:04.876
smaller pieces because those?

02:13:04.943 --> 02:13:06.912
Are approachable as opposed to

02:13:06.978 --> 02:13:08.046
being of the something that is

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:08.814
more comprehensive but

02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.083
ultimately those with the the

02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:12.117
answers we need to get to get to

02:13:12.184 --> 02:13:13.919
is a comprehensive conversation

02:13:13.985 --> 02:13:14.586
about.

02:13:14.653 --> 02:13:16.722
The broader cost societal cost

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:19.458
economic cost of decisions that

02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:20.625
have been made and how we can

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:23.261
support the economy but also

02:13:23.328 --> 02:13:25.530
protect the environment and

02:13:25.597 --> 02:13:27.199
every.

02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:29.101
Sector strata academy.

02:13:29.167 --> 02:13:31.103
Taking responsibility for its

02:13:31.169 --> 02:13:34.873
piece of a solution that

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.007
ultimately is is the goal.

02:13:36.074 --> 02:13:37.776
But that's what these

02:13:37.843 --> 02:13:39.678
conversations lead to hopefully

02:13:39.745 --> 02:13:40.846
and I appreciate everybody

02:13:40.912 --> 02:13:43.582
coming out on a really beautiful

02:13:43.648 --> 02:13:45.584
day here in Santa Cruz tough

02:13:45.650 --> 02:13:45.884
duty I know.

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:48.820
But I'll do it thank you all

02:13:48.887 --> 00:00:00.000
very much and we are adjourned
