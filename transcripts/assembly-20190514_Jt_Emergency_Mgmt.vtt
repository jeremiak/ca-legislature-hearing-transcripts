00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.122
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:53.558
IMPORTANT THAT AS WE HAVE THIS

00:34:53.624 --> 00:34:55.493
DISCUSSION TODAY.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.728
WE FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE ONE OF

00:34:57.795 --> 00:34:59.130
THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.598
PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST FEW

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:02.300
YEARS FIGHTING THE LARGEST

00:35:02.366 --> 00:35:04.602
WILDFIRES THE STATE HAS.

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:06.437
EVER SEEN ADDRESSING A CHANGING

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:07.939
CLIMATE.

00:35:08.005 --> 00:35:10.374
ADDRESSING THE THE TRAGEDIES

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.009
THAT HAVE STRUCK SO MANY OF OUR

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.811
COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT OF THESE

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:15.079
FIRES.

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:16.747
WHAT THE LESSONS ARE THAT WE'VE

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:18.583
LEARNED WHAT THE -- WHAT WHAT

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:20.318
ARE THE POLICIES IN PLACE AND

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:22.453
PERHAPS --I KNOW THAT THAT IS

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.222
PART OF THE PAPER THAT HAS BEEN

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:26.357
PRESENTED WITH THIS -- I KNOW

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.826
I'M INTERESTED IN -- HOW WE ARE

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:30.661

IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES?

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.998
AND THEN WHAT IT IS WE CAN DO TO

00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.533
IMPROVE UPON THEM.

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.801
IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:38.736
BE WORKING WITH ALL PHASES OF

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:39.871
GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE

00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:41.005
SECTOR.

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.241
BECAUSE ALL PHASES OF OUR

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:44.909
COMMUNITIES ARE IMPACTED WHETHER

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:46.711
IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY STATE LAND

00:35:46.777 --> 00:35:49.347
LOCAL LANDS OR FEDERAL LANDS.

00:35:49.413 --> 00:35:50.615
THESE FIRES DON'T KNOW THE

00:35:50.681 --> 00:35:51.916
DIFFERENCE AND FRANKLY DON'T

00:35:51.983 --> 00:35:54.352
CARE -- AND SO WE AS A

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:57.154
LEGISLATURE I THINK NEED TO BE.

00:35:57.221 --> 00:35:59.490

SHOOTING IN OUR AREA ON THAT

00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:38.462
AFFECTED -- SO MANY PEOPLE

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.264
INCLUDING STUDENTS AT PEPPERDINE

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.333
UNIVERSITY WHICH IS LOCATED IN

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:44.368
MALIBU. FIVE AND WE DID LOSE A

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.203
STUDENT AND SO ON THAT WAS WHAT

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.305
WE WOKE UP TO ON NOVEMBER EIGHTH

00:41:48.372 --> 00:41:49.206
AND THEN OF COURSE THE FIRE

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:50.908
BROKE OUT AT ABOUT. THREE

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.610
O'CLOCK SO -- IT'S IMPORTANT I

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:53.844
THINK FOR EVERYONE TO REALIZE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:55.412
THE STRAIN THAT OUR FIRST

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.448
RESPONDERS WERE UNDER ON AFTER

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:58.883
THAT SHOOTING.

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:00.251
AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:42:00.317 --> 00:42:02.453
THAT WE HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:03.821
WITH ON THAT YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:05.522
TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THROUGHOUT

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.591
THE STATE IS -- FIRST OF ALL THE

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:10.294
LACK OF POWER -- WE DID NOT HAVE

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.962
OUR POWER TURNED OFF BUT THE

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:13.597
ELECTRICITY DID GO OUT

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.366
THROUGHOUT OUR CITY IF YOU'RE

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.567
NOT FAMILIAR WITH MALIBU --

00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:18.369
WE'RE ABOUT TWENTY MILES LONG

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.838
AND ONE MILE DEEP AND OUR MAIN

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:23.040
ROAD IS PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

00:42:23.107 --> 00:42:24.475
WHICH IS SERVED BY TRAFFIC

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.677
SIGNALS SO IF THE POWER GOES OUT

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.245
WE LOSE ALL OF OUR TRAFFIC

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:28.946
SIGNALS.

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:30.915
WHICH ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:37.154
CALTRANS -- WAR OUR LAW

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:39.356
ENFORCEMENT IS PER BY DID BY THE

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.858
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BUT ON THE

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:41.992
C. H. P. ACTUALLY HASTERT

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:42.826
JURISTIC.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:43.494
JURISDICTION OVER THE SIGNALS --

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.128
SO THAT WAS OUR FIRST CHALLENGE

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.195
BECAUSE WE GOT THE NOTIFICATION

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:47.731
TO EVACUATE OUR ENTIRE CITY ON

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.034
IMMEDIATELY AND WE HAD TO

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.001
SOMEHOW FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.670
ALL THESE PEOPLE OUT ONE

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:53.737
DIRECTION ON PACIFIC COAST

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:54.638
HIGHWAY.

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:56.106
THERE WAS CONCERN NOT ONLY WITH

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.675
THE WALLS THE FIRE THAT WAS

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.610
HEADED TOWARDS MALIBU UP WITH A

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.178
FOURTEEN MILE LONG FRONT OF THE

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:01.946
FIRE.

00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.380
ON THAT THERE IS ALSO THE HELL

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.182
FIRE BURNING ON THE NORTH WEST

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:07.518
END OF OUR TOWNWHICH MADE

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.586
EVACUATING THAT WAY -- NOT A

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:11.188
POSSIBILITY SO WE HAD TO SEND

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:13.357
EVERYBODY SOUTH EAST ON PACIFIC

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:14.725
COAST HIGHWAY.

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:16.193
ON THE STORIES THAT MY RESIDENTS

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.395
TELL OUR SIX HOURS TO GET

00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:21.899

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.867
COMPLETE GRIDLOCK -- I WAS AT

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:25.669
OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER

00:43:25.736 --> 00:43:27.471
AT CITY HALL A WE WERE

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.839
STRUGGLING BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.140
HAVE GREAT CELL SERVICE --

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:32.843
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF POWER --

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:34.878
AND WE WERE TOLD VIA EMAIL OF

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.047
THAT RESOURCES FROM CALTRANS AND

00:43:37.114 --> 00:43:38.949
CHP HAD BEEN DISPATCHED TO

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:39.984
ASSIST WITH.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.019
TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT BUT HOWEVER

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.654
THEY HIDE IT.

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.489
SO ONE OF MY FIRST ASKS --

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:47.324
ANYWHERE I GO IS THAT THERE ARE

00:43:47.391 --> 00:43:49.426
MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:51.195
DISPATCH TO HELP WITH

00:43:51.261 --> 00:43:52.830
EVACUATIONS ON NO MATTER WHERE

00:43:52.896 --> 00:43:54.531
THAT THE FIRE IS I'M NOT THE

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:56.533
ONLY COMMUNITY.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.502
THAT HAS THIS TYPE OF A STRUGGLE

00:43:58.569 --> 00:43:59.269
WITH PEOPLE GETTING OUT THREE

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:00.637
SIGNALS IF YOU'RE.

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.306
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW SAN MATTEO

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.841
AND YOU NEEDED TO USE EL CAMINO

00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:05.476
RIEL YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.411
SAME PROBLEMS -- SO THAT WAS A

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.946
REALLY DIFFICULT THING THE OTHER

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:10.314
PROBLEM WITH THE LACK OF POWER

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:11.682
IS THAT OUR RESIDENTS.

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.083
AND MANY OF THEM DID NOT GET THE

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.120
EVACUATION NOTICE -- WE DID DO

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.955
HAVE A OF ROBOTS NOTIFICATION

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:20.491
SYSTEM WE USE IT REGULARLY --

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:22.426
STAFF IS TRAINED ON USING IT WE

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:24.294
HAD TESTED ARE REVERSED NINE ONE

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.896
ONE SYSTEM THREE TIMES IN THE

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.631
PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS -- BUT

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:29.299
WITHOUT POWER PEOPLE DON'T GET

00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:31.602
THOSE NOTIFICATIONS -- THERE IS

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:36.807
NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE VIA THE

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:38.542
INTERNET THERE'S NO POWER AND IN

00:44:38.609 --> 00:44:39.643
THAT TYPE OF COMMUNITY THAT WE

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.111
HAVE -- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:44:41.178 --> 00:44:42.312
GET SELF SERVICE ON A GOOD DAY

00:44:42.379 --> 00:44:43.680
SO PARTICULARLY WHEN CELL TOWERS --

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.449
OUT AND NOW IT WAS A CHALLENGE

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.484
THAT WE FACED -- NOT ONLY THE

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:48.652
DAY OF THE FIRE AND DURING

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.354
EVACUATIONS BUT THROUGHOUT THE

00:44:50.421 --> 00:44:53.690
FIRE INCIDENT -- WE HAD --

00:44:53.757 --> 00:44:55.092
SEVERAL HUNDRED RESIDENTS WHO

00:44:55.159 --> 00:44:56.894
STAYED BEHIND AND THEY WERE

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:59.763
BASICALLY CUT OFF FROM EVERYBODY

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.298
ON BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:02.766
SELF SERVICE.

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:04.501
I WAS BEGGING FOR TEMPORARY CELL

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:06.637
SERVICE TO BE BROUGHT IN BUT IT

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:07.938
TOOK DAYS AND DAYS.

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:09.807
AND ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:11.442
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IMPLEMENTING --

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.943
GOOD OLD FASHIONED SIRENS AND

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:14.144
ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:16.680
COULD BE USED TO ALERT PEOPLE ON

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.449
AND WE THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:19.950
GOOD OPTION.

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:22.186
ON THE OTHER ISSUE WHICH I'M

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:23.687
SURE YOU'VE HEARD IS BECAUSE WE

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.989
WERE THE THIRD FIRE ON THAT DAY

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:28.258
ON THE FIRE RESOURCES TOOK SOME

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.993
TIME TO GET TO US.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.195
ON AND SO IF SOMETHING WERE OF

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.529
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT FOR THE

00:45:32.596 --> 00:45:34.064
FUTURE FOR ANY COMMUNITY IF

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:35.566
THERE'S MULTIPLE FIRES THERE'S

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:37.868
JUST NOT ENOUGH TO GO AROUND AND

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:39.703
NOT SOMETHING THAT -- I THINK WE

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.271
ALL NEED TO FIGURE OUT A

00:45:41.338 --> 00:45:42.673
SOLUTION.

00:45:42.739 --> 00:45:44.208
FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS

00:45:44.274 --> 00:45:47.077
THAT THAT I DID WAS -- I DIDN'T

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:49.179
WAIT FOR THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM

00:45:49.246 --> 00:45:50.581
TO KICK IN FAR ARE MERCHANTS

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:52.182
OPERATIONS CENTER.

00:45:52.249 --> 00:45:53.951
AND WE HAD TO EVACUATE OUT OF

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:55.686
OUR CITY HALL WHICH IS WHERE OUR

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:58.522
EOC IS AND WE ACTUALLY RELOCATED

00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:59.590
TO THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.792
WHERE WE RAN OUR EOC FOR THREE

00:46:01.859 --> 00:46:04.194
WEEKS -- SO I WAS VERY FORTUNATE

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:05.662
THAT I HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:07.397
NEARBY SO CITIES WHO WERE

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.766
WILLING TO HOST US -- AND THEN --

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:12.136
WERE ALSO SMALL CITY WITH ABOUT

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:14.371
NINETY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.906
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DEPTH TO

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.474
CONTINUE RUNNING OUR EOC AND I

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:18.809
JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE.

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:20.344
AND CALLED MY FRIENDS IN OTHER

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.946
CITIES AND SAID I NEED HELP --

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:24.548
BUT WITHOUT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:26.150
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD

00:46:26.216 --> 00:46:27.751
GIVEN THE TIME THAT IT TYPICALLY

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.520
TAKES FOR MUTUAL AID TO KICK IN

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:37.194
pAND IT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALSO

00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:39.163
DONE -- I SERVED IN THE EOC AND

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:40.430
SANTA ROSA DURING THAT INCIDENT

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:41.198
AS WELL.

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:42.499
AS A AS A VOLUNTEER WOULD NOT

00:46:42.566 --> 00:46:42.900
UNDER MUTUAL AID.

00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:43.767
AND SET SOME OF THE THINGS

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.569
MOVING FOR THAT WERE LOOKING AT

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.371
ARE OBVIOUSLY THE BACKUP POWER

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:49.606
NOT ONLY FOR SIGNALS BUT FOR THE

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:50.941
CELL TOWERS.

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:52.176
AND HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND SOME

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:53.844
WAY TO MANDATE THE CELL

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:55.445
COMPANIES TO DO THAT -- WE'VE

00:46:55.512 --> 00:46:57.848
ALSO BEEN ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.783

TYPICALLY THOSE ARE SENT THROUGH

THE COUNTY -- BUT NOW WE AS A

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:21.238

THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CINEMA

00:48:52.562 --> 00:48:54.464
COMPLEX FIRES -- WAS AT THE TIME

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.266
THE MOST DEVASTATING FIRE IN THE

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:58.635
STATE'S HISTORY A HUNDRED AND

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.837
TEN THOUSAND ACRES WERE BURNED.

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:01.405
FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED

00:49:01.471 --> 00:49:02.439
HOMES WERE DESTROYED THAT MEANT

00:49:02.506 --> 00:49:04.608
5% OF SANTA ROSA'S HOUSING STOCK

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.176
SANTA ROSA BEING THE FIFTH

00:49:06.243 --> 00:49:07.477
LARGEST CITY IN THE BAY AREA.

00:49:07.544 --> 00:49:09.613
AND TWENTY FOUR LIVES WERE

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.415
TRAGICALLY LOST IN THOSE FIRES.

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:12.516
AND WHILE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:13.950
GO TO AND ARE MAKING WE ARE

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.652
MAKING LARGE STRIDES TO TOWARD A

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:16.720
FULL RECOVERY.

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.055
AND WE ARE EXCEEDINGLY GRATEFUL

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:18.855
TO OUR STATE LEGISLATIVE

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:20.290
DELEGATION FOR THEIR INVALUABLE

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.059
SUPPORT NOW BECAUSE SEE TO THAT

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.561
AND A RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT ABOUT

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:27.531
6% REBUILT SAID -- AT THAT'S

00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:28.131
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:29.900
HOMES BUT BY THE END OF THIS

00:49:29.966 --> 00:49:31.234
YEAR WE SHOULD BE ABOUT HALFWAY

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:32.936
DONE WITH REBUILD SO WE'RE

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.504
MAKING REALLY GOOD PROGRESS BUT

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:36.306
SURVIVOR STILL FACE INCREDIBLE

00:49:36.373 --> 00:49:37.374
CHALLENGES TO REBUILD.

00:49:37.441 --> 00:49:38.775
SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:40.744
INSURANCE INSURANCE REFORM IS

00:49:40.811 --> 00:49:41.712
GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO OFFER

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:43.213
SURVIVORS THE CONFIDENCE THEY

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:44.448
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:45.349
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE

00:49:45.415 --> 00:49:46.383
GOING TO HAVE INSURANCE

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.586
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND IT'LL BE

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.220
PRICED COMPETITIVELY.

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:50.754
EARLY THERE'S A LACK OF

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:51.955
TRANSPARENCY IN THE ADJUSTMENT

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.357
PROCESS AND FOR SOME THERE'S

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.359
LITTLE CERTAINTY THAT THEY WILL

FRAMEWORK.

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:13.009
IDENTIFIED IN THIS FRAMEWORK WAS --

00:50:13.076 --> 00:50:14.411
WAS THE THREAT OF DEAD AND DYING

REVENUES.

00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:08.725

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:34.718
PLAN.

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.019
IS REALLY ABOUT FEELS REDUCTION

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.721
ON PRIVATE PROPERTIES WE'RE

WE DON'T HAVE A MOST THIS IS

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.436
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MY OTHER

COLLEAGUES THERE'S NO ONE TO

00:52:54.638 --> 00:52:55.972
TAKE ALL OF THIS GREEN WASTE

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.507
WHAT DO WE DO WITH IT WHEN WE

60% OF OUR POPULATION IS FIFTY

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:02.579

00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:06.249
WE GET 265% AND THAT'S 40% SIXTY

00:53:06.316 --> 00:53:08.752

FUNCTIONAL NEEDS AND THEY NEED A

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.725
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE.

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:16.593
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE

LOOKING? FOR A WAY THAT WE CAN

00:53:54.497 --> 00:53:56.399
PARTNER WITH THEM IN CONJUNCTION

00:53:56.466 --> 00:53:57.834
WITH THE FEELS REDUCTION WORK

00:53:57.901 --> 00:53:59.669
THAT WE CAN DO TO MAYBE CREATE A

00:53:59.736 --> 00:54:04.140
NEW SYSTEM -- THE OTHER THING WE

00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:05.609
HAVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE THESE

00:54:05.675 --> 00:54:06.876
EMERGENCIES FOR YOUR RURAL

UP WITH A MATCH IS A VERY

00:54:10.347 --> 00:54:12.115
DIFFICULT PROCESS MEAN. FOR US

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:13.683
THE COUNTY OF TO ONLY AYE

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:14.918
RESERVES ARE TWO POINT NINE

00:54:14.985 --> 00:54:16.219
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN WE'RE

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.887
LOOKING AT A CATASTROPHIC EVENT

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:19.422
YOU COULD DEPLETE THOSE AND THEN

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:20.857
WE YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.093
OTHER WAYS THAT YOUR SENSUALLY

00:54:23.159 --> 00:54:23.593
STOP PROVIDING SERVICES

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:23.893
[inaudible]

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.196
SO.

00:54:26.262 --> 00:54:27.564
WHEN WE LOOK AT REGULATING

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:29.733
ENFORCING WE'VE BEEN TALKING

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:30.367
ABOUT THAT WHEN WE WENT OUT TO

00:54:30.433 --> 00:54:31.801
OUR COMMUNITY BEEN WORKING WITH

00:54:31.868 --> 00:54:33.870
CAL FIRE AND?

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.305
WHAT THAT MEANS IS IS WEAK?

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.740
AND I KNOW THE EL DORADO COUNTY

00:54:36.806 --> 00:54:38.908
JUST PAST VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.377
PLAN IT'S A GREAT PLAN.

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.845
BUT WE'RE NOT SURE HOW DO YOU

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:43.013
HELP YOUR HOMEOWNERS TO COME

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.514
INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THIS AND

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.349
WHAT WE FOUND LOCALLY IS EVEN

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.485
WHEN CAL FIRE DOES THEIR FIRE

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:49.786
SAFETY INSPECTIONS.

00:54:49.853 --> 00:54:51.454
WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE GET THEIR

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:53.023
CITATIONS THEY GO TO COURT THEY

00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:54.190
PAY THEIR CITATION AND MANY

00:54:54.257 --> 00:54:55.525
TIMES THEY DON'T GO BACK AND DO

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.760
THE WORKS WERE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:54:56.826 --> 00:54:58.895
OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN PARTNER

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:00.597
WITH OUR HOMEOWNERS? TO REDUCE

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.699
pSAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THEIR

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:04.367
ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND THEN THE

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:06.136
SIRENS AS WELL OUR IDEA OF THE

00:55:06.202 --> 00:55:08.738
SIRENS IS REALLY NOT FOR

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:09.339
EVACUATIONS BUT BY.

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:11.074
HANDING OUT BATTERY OPERATED

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:12.509
RADIOS AT THE SAME TIME IT'S

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:14.144
REALLY AN EDUCATION. FOR WHEN

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.079
THE POWER GOES OUT YOUR PHONE

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.614
LINES ARE WORKING TUNE TO THE

00:55:17.681 --> 00:55:18.515
THEM.

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:20.183
YOU CAN TUNE IN ON YOUR BATTERY

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.118
OPERATED RADIO AND GET THE MOST

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.253
CURRENT INFORMATION SO WE'RE

00:55:23.319 --> 00:55:24.587
ALSO TRYING.

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.822
TO BUT THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE AND

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.724

BECOME COMPLIANT IS IT IS VERY

00:55:43.039 --> 00:55:44.874
DIFFICULT WITHOUT THE MEANS TO

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:45.742

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.359
OF INDIANA WHERE THEY ARE

00:56:03.426 --> 00:56:04.394
TORNADO PRONE.

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.563
AND STILL USE SIRENS BECAUSE

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:08.364
THEY WERE THE MOST.

00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:09.733
EFFECTIVE MEANS THAT NEAR

00:56:09.799 --> 00:56:11.034
DOESN'TSHUT DOWN CAN BE RUN

00:56:11.101 --> 00:56:13.670
FROM A GENERATOR -- VERY LOUD SO

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:14.938
CERTAINLY LOUD ENOUGH FOR AN

00:56:15.004 --> 00:56:16.840
ENTIRE COMMUNITY TO BE ALERTED

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:20.043
AND POST WE'LL SEE AN AND THOMAS

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:20.710
RECENTLY IN SAND FIRE MY

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:22.645
INTERACTIONS WITH -- YOU KNOW

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:23.379
OUR LOCAL FIRST RESPONDER

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:26.116
COMMUNITY WAS CONCERNS AROUND

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.851
EFFECTIVE EVACUATION.

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.553
AND FOLKS I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.421
PERHAPS THAT TRAFFIC LAWS UNDER

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:32.555
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:33.957
DEFINITELY CHANGE AND FIRST

00:56:34.023 --> 00:56:35.759
RESPONDERS NEED THEM TO TO MOVE

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:37.026
IN AN ORDERLY FLOW.

00:56:37.093 --> 00:56:38.261
MALIBU OF COURSE BEING AT THAT

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:42.232
KIND OF RARE EXCEPTION WHERE THE

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:42.799
INGRESS AND EGRESS IS PRETTY

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:43.233
LIMITED.

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:43.900
IT WOULD BE MORE DIFFICULT AND I

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.068
FIND MYSELF WONDERING IF PERHAPS

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.669
WE ARE IN A TIME WHERE THE STATE

00:56:46.736 --> 00:56:48.338
NEEDS TO INVEST IN A SERIES OF

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.472
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.374
AROUND THAT VERY ISSUE SO THAT

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.243
COMMUNITIES ARE INFORMED --

00:56:53.309 --> 00:56:54.277
THROUGH MEANS THAT THEY

00:56:54.344 --> 00:56:56.045
REGULARLY ACCESS WHETHER IT'S

00:56:56.112 --> 00:56:58.047
SOCIAL MEDIA OR TELEVISION I'M.

00:56:58.114 --> 00:56:59.716
ABSOLUTELY POINTS HEARD AND

00:56:59.783 --> 00:57:02.585
TAKEN ON THE INSURANCE MARKET --

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:04.254
WE HAVE FOLKS EVEN IN MY

00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.189
COMMUNITIES I'M A YOU KNOW THE

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.490
URBAN INTERFACE AREA WHERE.

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:08.658
THEY'RE BEING NON RENEWED AND

00:57:08.725 --> 00:57:09.893
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN EXPERIENCED

00:57:09.959 --> 00:57:12.929
FIRE RECENTLY -- BUT I THINK.

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:14.164
YOU KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.398
GET OUT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:57:15.465 --> 00:57:17.500
EFFECTIVELY AND CONSISTENTLY

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.169
PERFORMING DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.603
INSPECTIONS DO YOU HAVE THE

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.338
CAPACITY TO HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:24.374
TO DO THAT -- AND DOES LOCAL

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.509
GOVERNMENT NEED MORE TOOLS TO

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.878
ASSIST PRIVATE LANDOWNERS -- TO

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:31.548
BE ABLE TO COMPLY AS AT WHAT'S

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:35.118
YOUR POINT.

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:36.753
I WOULD THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.887
IN CINEMA COUNTY RECENTLY

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:40.490
INVESTED IN PROGRAMS NINE

00:57:40.557 --> 00:57:41.090
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS INTO

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.292
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS TO DO

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:43.626
INSPECTIONS.

00:57:43.693 --> 00:57:45.328
BUT EVEN AT THAT RATE THAT'S

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:46.796
GOING TO TAKE US FIVE YEARS SO A

00:57:46.863 --> 00:57:48.498
CYCLE OF FIVE YEARS TO HIT EVERY

00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:49.999
HOME AND THAT'S ONLY REALLY IN

00:57:50.066 --> 00:57:51.301
THE LOCAL RESPONSE AREA.

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.569
AND IF YOU LOOK AT A MAP OF

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.404
CINEMA COUNTY IT'S 90% STATE

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.439
RESPONSE AREA SO WE'RE VERY

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.574
CHALLENGE IN TERMS OF FUNDING

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.009
AND THE REALITY IS IS FROM WHAT

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:01.344
WE'VE SEEN IN OAKLAND ANOTHER

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:02.946
JURISDICTIONS INSPECTIONS AND

00:58:03.012 --> 00:58:03.880
ENFORCEMENT.

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:06.382
IS THE BEST WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO

00:58:06.449 --> 00:58:08.451
BE COMPLIANCE -- WITH A

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:10.353
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND THE OUTCOME

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:13.456
IS THAT IS LESS FIRE SYSTEM.

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:14.991
I'M DEFINITELY AND THEN IN TERMS --

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.559
ECHOING -- WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:18.127
FROM TO ONLY COUNTY SAID GETTING

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.729
THE RESOURCES INTO THE HANDS OF

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:22.398
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK

00:58:22.465 --> 00:58:23.967
IT'S NOT INSIGNIFICANT WE'VE

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:26.135
GONE A LONG TIME WITHOUT?

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.337
REALLY SEEN WHAT A HEALTHY

00:58:27.403 --> 00:58:28.938
FOREST LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE AN

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.340
IDEA OF WHAT IT IS BUT THAT'S

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.741
NOT IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.243
THINNED OUT THE DEAD AND DYING

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.644
TREES NEED TO BE ELIMINATED.

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.045
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GONA CAM

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:39.649
KEEPERS A COMMUNITY SAFE

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:40.250
ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE IN THE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:41.618
MOVIE.

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:42.552
I I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SAYING

00:58:42.619 --> 00:58:44.254
AT THE RESOURCESIS DEFINITELY

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.655
THE ISSUE WE DO -- AND I WOULD

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:47.223
SAY MOST OUR FIRE DISTRICTS ARE

00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.359
ALL ENGAGE THEY ARE ALL DOING

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:50.927
THE FIRING -- INSPECTIONS.

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.729
AND THAT'S IN PARTNERSHIP ALSO

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:54.097
WITH WHAT CAL FIRE DOES.

00:58:54.163 --> 00:58:55.298
IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH WE MAYBE

00:58:55.365 --> 00:58:57.700
GET 215% OF THE IMPROVE PARCELS

00:58:57.767 --> 00:58:59.502
IN THE YEAR AND THEY SPEND A LOT

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:00.870
OF TIME GOING BACK AND TRYING TO

00:59:00.937 --> 00:59:02.071
BRING THOSE HOMES IN THE

00:59:02.138 --> 00:59:03.072
COMPLIANCE.

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.674
SO THE THE RESOURCES SIMPLY

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.276
AREN'T THERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:08.077
THE RESOURCES AT THE BOARD LEVEL

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:09.846
FOR THEM TO INVEST IN TO DO

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:10.713
TWENTY SO I MEAN FOR US IT'S

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.382
ONLY MAYBE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:59:12.448 --> 00:59:12.882
PARCELS.

00:59:12.949 --> 00:59:14.050
BUT THAT'S A LOT OF INSPECTIONS

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:16.019
IN A SINGLE YEAR -- BUT AND

00:59:16.085 --> 00:59:17.754
RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY A LOT OF

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.722
THEM PROBABLY 60% OF THEM

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:21.758
PROBABLY ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE.

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:24.160
AND SO IT'S PUTTING EVERYONE

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:27.463
ELSE AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THAT.

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.965
SAID THE CITY OF MALIBU IS A

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.466
CONTRACT CITY SO WE CONTRACT

00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:31.801
WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:33.670
DEPARTMENT FOR A FIRE SERVICES

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:35.571
AND THEY OVERSEE.

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.607
AND IN FORCE THE BRUSH CLEARANCE

00:59:37.674 --> 00:59:39.742
REQUIREMENTS -- BUT WHAT WE'VE

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:41.344
DONE ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IS WE

00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:43.446
JUST HIRED AT A FIRE SAFETY

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:45.982
POSITION ON A ON THAT PERSON

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:47.483
WILL WORK ON BEHALF OF THE CITY.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.285
AND ASSIST OUR RESIDENTS TO MAKE

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:50.887
SURE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLIANCE

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.922
WITH THEIR BRUSH CLEARANCE --

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:53.923
HOWEVER I DON'T THINK IT'S THE

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:55.825
ONLY SOLUTION ON THE WALLS THE

00:59:55.892 --> 00:59:59.195
FIRE -- WAS AT THE WINDS THAT

00:59:59.262 --> 01:00:01.397
DAY WERE WERE INCREDIBLE AND THE

01:00:01.464 --> 01:00:03.099
FIRE WAS FRONTING TWO MILES

01:00:03.166 --> 01:00:05.902
AHEAD OF ITSELF SO WE HAD EMBERS --

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:07.570
FAR AHEAD OF THE FRONT OF THE

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:10.206
FIRE -- LANDING ON ROOFS AND

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.075
WE'VE HEARD STORY AFTER STORY OF

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.377
WOOD CHIPS CATCHING ON FIRE OF

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.379
PEOPLE WHO USE RAILROAD TIES IN

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.914
THEIR LANDSCAPING.

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:20.016
I'M CATCHING ON FIRE SO IT IS

01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.319
ONE SOLUTION BUT I'M DEFINITELY.

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.621
NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION ON AND

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:27.690
THEN WHILE I AM HAVE MY THE MIKE

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.891

NO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN

SO ANYTIME WE HAVE ONE OF THESE

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:45.220
LARGE SCALE INCIDENTS IT DRAWS

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.723

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:55.964
PUTS THE CITIZENS OF SACRAMENTO

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:56.899
AT RISK.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.334
OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM DEPENDS ON

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.770
THE STAFFING AND THE ABILITY TO

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:04.439
RESPOND TO WILDFIRES PART WELL

01:14:04.506 --> 01:14:07.376
FAR PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE IS

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:08.610
PREVENTION EFFORTS.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:09.178
FORCE MITIGATION AND FUEL

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.646
REDUCTION IS KEY TO MANAGING

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:12.481
WILDFIRES AND PREVENTING THEM

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:13.816
FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:14.950
EVENTS.

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.952
LAND USE POLICIES ALSO VITAL TO

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:19.121
PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION.

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.389
IN THE AFTERMATH OF EVERY MAJOR

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.057
FIRE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.725
ATTENTION ON SMALLER FIXES THE

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.561
FOCUS ON INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:26.662
OWNERS.

01:14:26.728 --> 01:14:27.763
BUILDING MATERIALS DEFENSIBLE

01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:30.666
SPACE PROPER EGRESS TEMPORARY

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.134
REFUGE AND SO FORTH.

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.069
BUT CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE TO

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.604
ACCOUNT FOR RISK FACTORS.

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:37.139
THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN AN

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:38.574
AREA THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.909
POTENTIAL FUEL LOADS PREVIOUS

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:42.644
FIRE HISTORY AND WEATHER EVENTS.

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:43.946
THESE MORE EXPENSIVE RISK

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.981
FACTORS CAN'T BE VIEWED AS

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:48.417
STRICTLY LOCAL ISSUES.

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:50.185
THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:51.687
TOUCHES EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.755
THE COST OF THESE DISASTERS IS

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.257
LARGELY BORNE BY ALL OF US.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.392
IN THIS NEW ABNORMAL CALIFORNIA

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:59.094
MUST DO MORE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.296
THE LAND USE POLICY TAKE THESE

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:02.898
RISK FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:04.433
IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT WE

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.468
SHOULD BE LOOKING CLOSELY AT NEW

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.269
DEVELOPMENT.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.437
IN THE WOMB WILDLAND URBAN

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:10.606
INTERFACE AND OTHER HIGH RISK

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:11.473
AREAS.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.774
BUT WE MUST ALSO LOOK AT

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:14.276
EXISTING DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.411
BEEN BUILT OVER THE YEARS WITH

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:17.613
LITTLE INTERVENTION.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.214
WHILE THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:20.415
FIRE IN PARADISE WAS BEYOND

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:21.483
MEASURE.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.484
WE KNOW THAT THE TOWN WAS

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.586
DEVELOPED HALF A CENTURY AGO

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.153
WHEN THE PERSPECTIVE WAS FOR

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.655
DIFFERENT.

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.190
WE HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND LOCAL

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.691
ZONING AND CONSIDER THE BIGGER

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:30.392
PICTURE.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:33.929
VIEW LOADING LOCATION ROADS IN

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.998
AND OUT IGNITION SOURCES AND

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.666
OTHER CASUAL FACTORS.

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.167
ONLY THEN CAN WE DECIDE ISSUES

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:40.903
SUCH AS SPACING ROADS AND

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:41.770
STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION OF NEW

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.739
CONSTRUCTION.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:44.573
OF COURSE.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.041
NO ONE SET OF PRESCRIPTIONS IS

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:47.576
FOOL PROOF IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:48.844
SANTA ROSA FIRES AT THE CHIEFS

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:50.245
WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:51.680
THEIR ALREADY WIDE ROADS PLENTY

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:54.283
OF EGRESS AND IN MANY CASES MORE

01:15:54.349 --> 01:15:55.450
MODERN MATERIALS.

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:56.919
EVEN HERE THESE EXPERIENCES

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.687
SHOULD OFFER A ROADMAP.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.088
AS WE LOOK TO REBUILD.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.189
AS TO THE STATE'S ROLE IN

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.325
PREVENTION FIRST AND FOREMOST IT

01:16:03.392 --> 01:16:04.426
REQUIRES A REALISTIC AND MORE

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:06.228
CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE FIRE

01:16:06.295 --> 01:16:08.063
RISK IN THE STATE AND ALL ITS

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.465
COMMUNITIES -- FIRES MAPS --

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.167
UNDERGOING REVISION BUT THE LAW

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.902
ONLY REQUIRES CAL FIRE TO

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:17.005
PUBLISH DATA ON VERY HIGH A FIRE

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.274
HAZARD SAFETY ZONES.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:20.909
WHEN YOU OVER IDENTIFY PEOPLE

01:16:20.976 --> 01:16:22.577
BECOME NUMB TO THE RISK IN OTHER

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:25.047
AREAS LIKE HIGH -- MODERATE FAR

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:27.349
HAS HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.717
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES LOCAL

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:30.052
GOVERNMENTS TO ADOPT THE CAL

01:16:30.118 --> 01:16:32.020
FIRE MAP BUT IN MANY CASES

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.622
LOCALS DON'T COMPLY AND

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:36.091
PENALTIES ARE SIGNIFICANT.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.326
THESE LAWS NEED MORE TEETH.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:38.327
FINALY AND MOST EGGS

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:40.095
SIGNIFICANTLY IS IMPORTANT THAT

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:41.463
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:43.732
PRACTICAL ISSUES ALONG WILD FIRE

01:16:43.799 --> 01:16:45.167
PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE.

01:16:45.233 --> 01:16:46.702
BUT IT'S AN INVISIBLE COST IT'S

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.638
REALLY DISCUSSED IS FAR BETTER

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:51.807
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.275
IN THIS NEW NORMAL FIREFIGHTERS

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:54.710
ARE WAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:55.978
LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.679
DEPLOYED MORE OFTEN AND COME

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.281
ACROSS.

01:16:59.348 --> 01:17:00.916
WELL WAY TOO MANY DEATHS.

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:05.020
IN THE CASE OF THE CAMPFIRE.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:06.054
EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:08.123
LIVES UP THERE AND MORE

01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:10.225
FIREFIGHTERS WERE AFFECTED BY

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.527
THOSE ISSUES THEN I THINK WE'RE

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:13.795
TRULY IDENTIFIED.

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:15.364
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:18.066
DID -- WHILE WE WERE UP THERE

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.401
WAS CAL FIRE DID A GREAT JOB

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:20.869
THEY'VE THEY'VE STARTED

01:17:20.936 --> 01:17:22.204
PROVIDING THEIR EMERGENCY SIR.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.872
SERVICE SUPPORT UNIT WHICH IS

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.207
THERE TO INTERVENE IN SOME OF

01:17:25.273 --> 01:17:26.875
THESE CASES.

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.945
BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO DO MORE --

01:17:30.012 --> 01:17:31.646
AS A LOT OF THESE FIREFIGHTERS

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.882
AT WORK IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:34.649
THOSE ARE THEIR NEIGHBORS THAT

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:35.317
ARE KILLED.

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.586
AND A LOT OF THEM HAD TO RESPOND

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:39.554
AND PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.289
SEARCH TEAMS THAT WERE WORKING

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:41.957
IN THOSE AREAS.

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:44.526
AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:45.027
THEM AS THEY WATCH THEIR

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.728
NEIGHBOR HERB IT'S BURNED DOWN

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:47.729
THEY BATTLE THE WILDFIRE FOR

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:49.264
WEEKS AND WERE PART OF THE BODY

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.365
RECOVERY PROCESS.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.100
FACING THAT KIND OF TRAGEDY CAN

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:53.735
BE TO LARGER BURDEN FOR ANYBODY

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:55.570
THAT'S WHY PEER SUPPORT IS SO

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:56.938
VITAL TO FIRST RESPONDERS.

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.306
WE SAW THIS WORK BEST AT THE

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.842
CAMPFIRE WITH THE GROUND PEER

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:01.743
SUPPORT SERVICES.

01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:02.944
FROM ONE FIREFIGHTERS WERE ABLE

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:03.445
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:04.980
EXPERIENCED AND WITNESSED WITH

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.581
OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS AND

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.250
TRAINED PERSONNEL.

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.418
CURRENTLY IN THE CITY SACRAMENTO

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:11.887
LIMA BAY WILL HEALTH COORDINATOR

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:12.320
FOR OUR DEPARTMENT.

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:14.456
AND THE WE ARE SLOWLY RECOVERING

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.191
ARE REALIZING THAT SOME OF THESE

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.759
ISSUES ARE SO IMPORTANT TO

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:18.827
REMEMBER SO I'D LIKE TO THANK

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:20.629
BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR

01:18:20.695 --> 01:18:22.898
SB FIVE FORTY TWO AS WE GO FOR

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.066
BECAUSE THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:25.267
TOOLS THAT WE NEED. TO ARM

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.402
OURSELVES WITH LOCALLY TO MAKE

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:29.204
SOME OF THESE CHANGES AND THE

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:31.273
THE CARE AND WELL BEING OF OUR

01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:33.075
MEMBERS.

01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:33.909
HOW THE FIREFIGHTERS?

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.377
IS BEING BEYOND JUST WHAT IS

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.045
PHYSICAL IN IS THE KEY TO WORK

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:38.213
THAT WE DO.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.114
THERE CERTAINLY ISN'T ANYONE

01:18:39.181 --> 01:18:41.249
ANSWER ON HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THE

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:43.885
NEXT -- SUPPORT PREVENT NEXT BIG

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:44.886
WILD FIRE.

01:18:44.953 --> 01:18:46.021
BUT WITH MEANINGFUL CHANGES WE

01:18:46.088 --> 01:18:47.255
CAN TAKE THE RIGHT STEPS TOWARDS

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.590
BEING BETTER PREPARED AND

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.025
EQUIPPED TO RESPOND TO THE

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.726

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:54.996
FIREFIGHTERS. TO HAVE THE

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.565
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAL THE WOUNDS

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:57.999
AND CONTINUE TO DO THE JOB THEY

01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:09.044
ISSUE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU

ABOUT -- THE IMPACTS OF THE

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:59.361
ABILITY. TO USE THESE NEW

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.897
STATUTORY -- INCENTIVES IF YOU

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:04.199
WILL A REQUIREMENT TO DO SOME OF

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.400
THE WORK THAT YOU'VE TALKED

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.903
ABOUT WE NEED TO LINK -- SO ASK

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.638
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IN A BUT

01:20:09.704 --> 01:20:11.406
LET ME START WITH THE BEHAVIORAL.

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.008
HEALTH ISSUE -- WE'RE SEEING A

01:20:13.074 --> 01:20:15.043
NUMBER OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:16.811
IN PARTICULAR FIREFIGHTERS WHO

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:19.681
ARE -- HAVING TROUBLE ADDRESSING

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:21.082
THE HORROR THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.151
pTHROUGH BEING AWAY FROM THEIR

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.286
FAMILIES TO CHECK TRENCHING A

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:25.820
PRETTY HIGH NUMBER OF THESE

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:30.058
FOLKS.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.526
ACTUALLY COMMITTING SUICIDE.

01:20:31.593 --> 01:20:32.327
I'M WONDERING WHAT IF ANYTHING

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:34.162
IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS THIS --

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.964
IS PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:38.633
NEED TO HAVE -- MORE

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.236
FIREFIGHTERS AVAILABLE SO THAT

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.271
THAT WE CAN REMOVE SOME OF SOME

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.640
OF THESE FOLKS FROM -- THE FIELD

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:47.542
DURING THESE FIRES GIVE THEM A

01:20:47.609 --> 01:20:49.077
LITTLE BREAK SOME FIREFIGHTERS

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.111
HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FIRES FOR

01:20:50.178 --> 01:20:51.580
MONTHS I KNOW WITH THE THOMAS

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:52.480
FIRE.

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.749
IT STARTED IN DECEMBER WENT

01:20:54.816 --> 01:20:55.850
RIGHT THROUGH CHRISTMAS RIGHT

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.452
THROUGH NEW YEARS SO PEOPLE AWAY

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.020
FROM THEIR FAMILIES DURING YOU

01:20:59.087 --> 01:21:00.722
KNOW THESE VERY CRITICAL TIMES

01:21:00.789 --> 01:21:01.957
OF THE YEAR.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.693
WE HAD THE DEBRIS FLOW LOST

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:05.860
TWENTY THREE PEOPLE IN.

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.329
THERE COUPLE OF WHOM IS STILL

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.364
NOT BEEN FOUND BUT FINDING THEIR

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.499
BODIES AND IN VERY DIFFICULT

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:14.202
STATES -- WE WAS PRETTY HORRIFIC

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:15.537
TO A LOT OF THESE FOLKS AND I'M

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.038
JUST WONDERING.

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:19.274
IN RECOGNIZING. EIGHTY PEOPLE

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.909
WHO BURNED TO DEATH AND SO FORTH

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.644
WHAT WHAT KINDS OF STEPS ARE

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.846
BEING TAKEN IF ANY. TO DEAL WITH

01:21:24.913 --> 01:21:28.450
THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE WORK THAT

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:31.586
THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS -- TO

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:32.654
SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:33.722
BEING DONE -- THIS YEAR.

01:21:33.788 --> 01:21:35.290
UNFORTUNATELY THE CAMPFIRE I

01:21:35.357 --> 01:21:36.491
MEAN IT BEING SUCH A LARGE AND

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.093
SAID BUT IT WAS PROBABLY SOME OF

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.427
THE BEST WORK THAT I'D SEEN WITH

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.096
THE EMERGENCY SUPPORT SERVICES

01:21:41.162 --> 01:21:41.863
UNIT THAT.

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:43.932
ACTUALLY CAL FIRE HAS INTEGRATED

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.300
INTO THEIR INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.968
PROGRAM.

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:49.638
THEY ALSO -- LEND MORE CREDENCE

01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:50.972
TO ACTUALLY ADDRESSING THOSE

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:53.575
ISSUES THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT --

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:57.045
MEMBERS BEING AFFECTED BY --

01:21:57.112 --> 01:22:00.048
SOME OF THE THE SEEING THE DESKS

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.017
AS WELL AS THE FULL LENGTH OF

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.151
TIME BEING AWAY FROM THEIR

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.953
FAMILIES ALL THOSE THINGS THAT

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.855
ACTUALLY LEAD UP. TO SOME OF THE

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:08.623
STRUGGLES THAT WE DO SEE ON THE

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:09.958
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE OF STUFF

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:11.493
AND THEY ARE DRESSING THOSE.

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.495
AND AND IT HAS GROWN OVER THE

01:22:13.561 --> 01:22:15.130
LAST FEW YEARS AND IT'S GETTING

01:22:15.196 --> 01:22:16.131
BETTER.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.632
BUT A THIRD THEY'RE STILL DOES

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:19.367
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE WORK

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.535
THAT'S DONE IT NEEDS TO BECOME

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:23.138
MORE STATEWIDE LOCALLY HERE --

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.873
MY EXPERIENCES LAST YEAR WAS

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.441
MORE IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.376
REGION AND THEY DID A GREAT JOB

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.245
AND AGAIN THEY WERE COMMITTED TO

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.946
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.148
TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND

01:22:33.214 --> 01:22:36.751
THAT THE THE LEADERS IN THOSE --

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:38.186
TEAMS AND STUFF WERE ACTUALLY

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:40.155
LOOKING AT THEIR MEMBERS AND

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.589
THEN THAT THEY EAT EMERGENCY

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:42.891
SUPPORT UNISYS SERVICES EXCUSE

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:43.391
ME.

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:44.793
THEY WERE OUT THERE WORKING WITH

01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:46.528
PEOPLE ON THE LINE TALKING TO

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:48.063
THOSE MEMBERS SO.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.030
WE'RE MAKING SOME OF THE RIGHT

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.865
STEPS BUT WE DO NEED TO INVEST

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.901
MORE RESOURCES INTO ACTUALLY

01:22:52.967 --> 01:22:54.135
MAKING THAT A MORE ROBUST --

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:56.371
PROGRAM AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.940
IT'S STATEWIDE AND IT AND

01:22:59.007 --> 01:22:59.674
ACTUALLY ADDRESSES ALL THE

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:01.543
MEMBERS -- THE ANSWER TO YOUR

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.178
QUESTION -- THAT THAT'S HELPFUL

01:23:03.244 --> 01:23:04.913
I I'M WONDERING ON THE OTHER --

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.648
ISSUE WHETHER YOU KNOW THE

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:07.782
LESSONS LEARNED THINGS THAT

01:23:07.849 --> 01:23:09.417
WE'RE DOING NOW THAT WE PUT INTO

01:23:09.484 --> 01:23:11.653
PLACE ARE THEY ARE THEY HELPFUL

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.089
ARE IT ARE THEY BEING ADOPTED DO

01:23:14.155 --> 01:23:15.657
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THEM.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:18.993
WE DID IT AGAIN SB NINE A ONE SB

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.261
TWELVE SIXTY A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.597
LEGISLATION TO TRY TO DO WITH

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.732
SOME OF THESE ISSUES YOU PHRASE.

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:26.067
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WE TRY TO

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:33.308
DO WORK NOW AND YOU YOU MADE THE

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.043
POINT THAT WE NEED TO PUT TEETH

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.477
INTO THE LOCAL INPUT

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:37.312
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE MAPS.

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:38.313
WHICH ARE AS I UNDERSTAND

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:38.880
THEY'RE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.181
UPDATED BUT I KNOW IN MY AREA

01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.850
WE'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM -- WE

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.885
NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE ARE FOR

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.253
FIRE SOMEONE'S ARE WE'RE OR

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.423
DEBRIS FLOWS ON SORRY AND THIS

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.325
IS A TOUGH CALL BECAUSE THERE'S

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:51.860
A LOT OF FRICTION.

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.161
THAT EXISTS BUT I'M WONDERING

01:23:53.228 --> 01:23:55.764
WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU BOTH SEEN IF

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:57.432
ANYTHING TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:23:57.499 --> 01:23:58.600
THESE THAT THERE'D HAVE BEEN

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.101
DONE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:24:00.168 --> 01:24:01.836
CONCERNS THAT YOU PHRASE LIKE

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:03.138
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT SECTOR.

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.773
YEAH ALL THESE -- ITEMS ARE

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:06.508
COMING BEFORE US ARE GREAT --

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:07.876
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.477
I'VE SEEN CHANGE IN THE LAST

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:10.512
YEAR.

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:12.147
IS THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.382
COLLABORATION BETWEEN EVERYONE --

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:15.350
WHILE THERE WAS ALWAYS GOOD CLAP

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:17.452
YOUR COLLABORATION BETWEEN CAL

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.287
FIRE AND YES AND OTHER LOCAL

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:20.855
AGENCIES NOW WE'RE BRINGING

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.190
UTILITIES INTO THAT.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.758
INTO THE MIX AND THAT IS

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.493
ESSENTIAL WE CANNOT DO THIS BY

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:28.830
OURSELVES -- THEY HAVE SOME OF

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:31.199
THE MOST -- UP TO DATE.

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:32.901
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED TO

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.369
LEVERAGE FOR THESE FUSION

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.838
CENTERS THE INFORMATION EASE THE

01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:38.306
FLOW BACK AND FORTH.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:40.909
AS IS QUICK AS IT CAN TO HELP

01:24:40.975 --> 01:24:43.044
EACH OTHER MOVE FORWARD ONE OF

01:24:43.111 --> 01:24:44.345
THE BIGGEST ISSUES WE

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:47.415
EXPERIENCED IN OUR ON OUR FIRE --

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:49.517
BETWEEN SIX PM AND MIDNIGHT IN

01:24:49.584 --> 01:24:51.186
SANTA ROSA WE HAD TEN REPORTED

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:52.554
STRUCTURE FIRES IN TWENTY

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.255
REPORTED VEGETATION FIRES THAT

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:55.957
WAS BEFORE THE TUBS FIRE EVEN

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:57.192
CAME TO SANTA ROSA.

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.093
IT HAS A ROSE UNTIL ONE O'CLOCK

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:00.895
SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.397
WHEN A FIRE STARTS IN ANOTHER

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:07.669
COUNTY AND IS BURNING TOWARD

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:08.503
ANYBODY.

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:10.638
AND SO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IS

01:25:10.705 --> 01:25:12.540
HUGE ALITALIA'S SONOMA COUNTY WE

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.175
ALREADY WE HAVE FIFTEEN CAMERAS

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.511
UP THANKS TO SOME COUNTY WATER

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:19.013
P. JEANNIE AND SOME OTHERS -- SO

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.615
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AND WE

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:22.484
HAVE THESE UP IN DISPATCH SO IF

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:23.918
THAT THERE ARE A CALL COMES IN

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:25.587
WE CAN LOOK PICKED THE CAMERA

01:25:25.653 --> 01:25:27.055
WERE WE THIS APPROPRIATE.

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.623
YEP WE HAVE SMOKE IT HAPPENED

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:30.258
TWICE LAST YEAR WELL WE ACTUALLY

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:32.861
DIALED IN THE THE ACTUAL AREA IN

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.662
CENTER PROPER RESOURCES AND THEN

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.264
YOU CAN MONITOR HOW FAST IT'S

01:25:36.331 --> 01:25:37.932
GROWING.

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:38.533
AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.334
FIRE.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.703
SO WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY TODAY THAT

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.905
THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN TWO

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:44.472
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHICH IS

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:45.106
HELPFUL.

01:25:45.173 --> 01:25:46.174
AS FAR AS THE VEGETATION

01:25:46.241 --> 01:25:47.542
MANAGEMENT THAT HAS TO BE A

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:49.711
REGIONAL APPROACH THERE'S NO ONE

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.212
SINGLE SILVER BOWL OF THIS GOING

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:52.914
TO FIX THIS.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:53.882
THIS IS A HUNDRED YEARS IN THE

01:25:53.948 --> 01:25:57.819
MAKING LAND USE HAS CHANGED --

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:59.120
I'LL TAKE AGAIN THE TUBS FIRE WE

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.321
HAVE THE HANLEY FIRE WHICH

01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:03.758
BASICALLY IS THE SAME FOOTPRINT.

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:04.392
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR NUMBER LESS

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:05.994
THAN TWO HUNDRED STRUCTURES MOST

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.896
OF THOSE WERE BARNES MOST OF THE

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:12.000
LAND WAS EITHER ORCHARD OR

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:12.600
GRACED.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:13.668
WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW WE HAVE

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:14.769
HOMES STODDARD EVERYWHERE AND

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:15.370
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF GRAZING

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.137
GOING ON SO YOU HAVE.

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:18.339
MANY MANY YEARS OF VEGETATION

01:26:18.406 --> 01:26:20.108
GROWTH THAT WAS DEALT WITH

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:22.477
ANOTHER WAY AND WE JUST DON'T

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.978
HAVE THAT NOW SO IT TAKES A

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.647
REGIONAL APPROACH YOU HAVE TO BE

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:26.347
WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AROUND

01:26:26.414 --> 01:26:27.081

IT WAS HARD IT DID NOT SURVIVE

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:50.171

PLAN THAT'S JUST FOR THE CITY

01:30:18.913 --> 01:30:21.749
SANTA ROSA THE COUNTY HAS A PLAN

01:30:21.816 --> 01:30:23.451
AS OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:24.485
SONOMA COUNTY.

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:25.820
BUT NURSE THIRTY FIVE

01:30:25.887 --> 01:30:27.455
DEPARTMENTS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AND

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:28.823
SONOMA COUNTY RIGHT WHEN WE'RE

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.191
WORKING THROUGH THAT.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.692
BUT EVERYONE HAS A LOCALITY

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.495
EVERYONE HAS A RESPONSIBILITY --

01:30:34.562 --> 01:30:35.463
THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS HAVE A

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:37.498
RESPONSIBILITY TO HOMEOWNERS

AND THE THE BIG THING THAT THAT

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:48.342
I SEE IS WE HAVE A LACK OF

01:30:48.409 --> 01:30:49.877

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:53.901
IT'S FUNDING.

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:56.871
MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.005
RIGHT SO ONE QUESTION AND

01:32:58.072 --> 01:32:59.106
CONCERN THAT I DID HAVE I THINK

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.675
IT'S IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR NOW

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.542
THROUGH.

01:33:01.609 --> 01:33:03.477
THE FIRST TWO PANELS THAT WE

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.012
REALIZE THAT MITIGATION IN TERMS

01:33:05.079 --> 01:33:06.314
OF FORRESTER CLEARING BRUSH

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.615
CLEARANCE HOME ABATEMENT HOME

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:09.417
HARDENING IS GOING TO BE A LONG

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:10.918
TERM PROJECT.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.154
BUT ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS --

01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.322
FOR MY CONSTITUENTS AND MY

01:33:14.388 --> 01:33:15.823
CONSTITUENTS AND THE MEN AND

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:17.024
WOMEN IN FIRE SERVICES IN

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.960
PARTICULAR IS WHAT CAN WE DO. TO

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.528
KEEP YOU SAFE IN THE NEXT FEW

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:23.164
CYCLES AND YOU EACH MENTIONED --

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:24.899
SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU THINK

01:33:24.966 --> 01:33:26.600
COULD BE MADE TO THE MUTUAL AID

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:27.735
PROGRAM SOUNDS LIKE PRE

01:33:27.802 --> 01:33:29.503
POSITIONING SHOWS SOME PROMISE

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:30.538
BUT THERE WERE OTHER

01:33:30.604 --> 01:33:32.273
TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS --

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:33.808
THAT YOU BOTH MENTIONED I'D I'D

01:33:33.874 --> 01:33:35.409
LOVE TO HAVE YOU I HAVE A MOMENT

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:36.310
TO EXPLORE THAT A LITTLE BIT

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:37.878
MORE IN DEPTH AND SEE IF THAT

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:38.746
SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE

01:33:38.813 --> 01:33:41.048
ABLE.

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:41.582
TO START TAKING A LOOK AT

01:33:41.649 --> 01:33:45.419
INVESTING IN -- SO YEAH THANK

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:46.287
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION THAT'S

01:33:46.354 --> 01:33:47.788
GREAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:33:47.855 --> 01:33:49.357
THINGS OUT TO KEEP US SAFE. ONE

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.225
OF THE THINGS WE STRUGGLED WITH --

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:53.027
WITH OUR FIRES WAS A LACK OF

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:54.128
RESOURCES.

01:33:54.195 --> 01:33:57.031
AND PART OF THAT -- WAS.

01:33:57.098 --> 01:34:00.468
CAL FIRE WAS THE COMMAND CENTER

01:34:00.534 --> 01:34:01.802
FOR THREE MAJOR FIRES THE NOT AS

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.738
THE TUBS ALICE ONE DISPATCH

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:04.438
CENTER.

01:34:04.505 --> 01:34:06.007
THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:34:06.073 --> 01:34:07.808
OVERCOME AND THEN WHEN YOU SO

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:09.810
FOR INSTANCE THERE WAS SEVENTY

01:34:09.877 --> 01:34:11.145
EIGHT STRIKE TEAMS ORDERED FOR

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:13.848
THE TUBS FIRE -- FORTY RIGHT OUT

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:16.183
THE GATE AND THEN ANOTHER TWENTY

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:17.418
FIVE ANOTHER TEN AND A NUMBER

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:18.986
AND ANOTHER THREE WE REALLY

01:34:19.053 --> 01:34:21.555
DIDN'T GET ANY RESOURCES AND FOR

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:23.491
PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR HOURS.

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.393
AND RESOURCES THAT DID COME IN

01:34:25.459 --> 01:34:26.360
KNEW THERE WAS A FIRE BECAUSE

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:27.828
OUR BUDDY CALL THEM AND THEY GOT

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:29.430
ON THE ROAD AND AND WITHOUT ANY

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:32.033
ORDERS WHICH WE TRY NOT TO DO.

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:33.634
BUT IN THIS CASE ALL THE ORDERS

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:35.903
WENT THROUGH CAL FIRE WHICH GOES

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:37.471
THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:39.673
WHICH WE ASK COMES INTO THAT

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:41.509
SYSTEM DOWN THE ROAD.

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:44.545
AND FOR FOR ME I'VE BEEN HARPING

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.313
ON THIS FOR AWHILE -- WHEN

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.448
WHENEVER WE HAVE BIG ORDERS LIKE

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.316
THAT WE NEED TO ME WE NEED TO

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.419
SPLIT HALF GO TO CAL FIRE HALF

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.454
GO -- TO YES AND YOU GET ALL THE

01:34:53.521 --> 01:34:54.355
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:55.923
ENGINES GONE AS AS QUICK AS YOU

01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:57.625
CAN WE HAD A LOT OF ENGINES IN

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.626
THE EAST BAY.

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.428
THAT JUST DID NOT GET DISPATCHED

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:01.862
BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME FOR PEOPLE

01:35:01.929 --> 01:35:04.398
TO INPUT ALL THAT INFORMATION.

01:35:04.465 --> 01:35:05.399
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO HELP WE

01:35:05.466 --> 01:35:08.035
CANNOT HOLD UP RESPONSE ON

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:10.237
PAPERWORK OR COMPUTER WORK.

01:35:10.304 --> 01:35:11.772
AND WE NEED TO OVERCOME THAT I

01:35:11.839 --> 01:35:13.407
THINK THERE'S SOME GOOD WORK

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:16.510
THAT THAT THAT CHIEF PORTER.

01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:17.278
AND DIRECTOR GIL DO SHE'S GOING

01:35:17.344 --> 01:35:18.412
TO REPORT ON BECAUSE I KNOW

01:35:18.479 --> 01:35:19.847
THERE ARE SOME CHANGES COMMON.

01:35:19.914 --> 01:35:22.450
BUT IT'S A BIG SHIP AND BUT WE

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.318
NEED TO TURN FOR ME IT IS NOT

01:35:24.385 --> 01:35:25.319
TURNING FAST ENOUGH.

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:27.121
AS MUCH AS THEY'RE WORKING ON IT

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:29.490
IT'S IT'S IT'S STILL A VERY

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.058
CUMBERSOME.

01:35:31.125 --> 01:35:32.893
MODEL SO THAT KEEPS US SAFER

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.361
KEEPS OUR MEMBER SAFE IT GETS

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:37.331
ALL EQUIPMENT THAT WE CAN -- AS

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:38.666
QUICK AS POSSIBLE I WILL SAY

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:39.733
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S A

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:45.906
LITTLE UNFAIR TO BLAME ANYTHING

01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.274
ON THAT AND I THERE WAS SO MUCH

01:35:47.341 --> 01:35:48.409
GOING ON THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:49.910
RESOURCES. FOR ANYONE AND I

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:50.744
REALIZE THAT THERE'S POOR

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:51.612
COMMUNITIES IN MENDOCINO THEY

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:52.913
DIDN'T GET ANY RESOURCES NAY

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.215
LOST PEOPLE AS WELL AS HOMES.

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:55.783
SO IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:58.152
NIGHTS IT WAS VERY VERY VERY

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.320
DIFFICULT.

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:00.721
BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPROVEMENTS

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:02.790
WE CAN MAKE INTO THE RESOURCE

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:03.457
ORDERING SYSTEM.

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:05.092
AND I'M I'M SURE YOU HEAR ABOUT

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:07.294
SOME OF THAT LATER.

01:36:07.361 --> 01:36:08.462
IT JUST TO KIND OF TACK ON TO

01:36:08.529 --> 01:36:09.563
THAT TO THAT LOCALLY HERE FOR

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:11.031
THE SECOND OWNER FIREFIGHTERS

01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.833
AGAIN TYPICALLY AND ANYONE OF

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.168
THESE LARGE INCIDENTS.

01:36:14.235 --> 01:36:16.370
WE ARE USUALLY.

01:36:16.437 --> 01:36:18.973
ON A NORMAL BASIS WE SET UP

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:19.740
THREE STRAIGHT GAMES WHICH IS

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.775
TYPICALLY THAT'S FIVE ENGINE

01:36:21.842 --> 01:36:23.878
COMPANIES -- AND MIGHT BE TYPE

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:25.946
THREE MIGHT BE TYPE ONE IS PART

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:26.814
OF THE YES RESPONSE.

01:36:26.881 --> 01:36:28.382
WILL CURRENTLY LIKE I SAID

01:36:28.449 --> 01:36:29.583
EARLIER WHEN.

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:30.885
WE ARE RUNNING IT MANDATORY

01:36:30.951 --> 01:36:33.020
STAFFING ALREADY AND ON A

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:34.288
REGULAR BASIS WE'RE HAVING A

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:35.623
BROWN OUT OR CLOSE A STATION

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.258
WHEN WE HAVE ONE OF THESE LARGER

01:36:37.324 --> 01:36:38.092
SCALE INCIDENTS.

01:36:38.159 --> 01:36:41.262
I MEAN WE WE RESPOND BUT IT PUTS

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:43.497
OUR DEPARTMENTS AT RISK AS WELL

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:44.999
AS THE MUSIC MUNICIPALITIES WE

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:46.100
SERVE.

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:47.334
FROM HAVING TO MAKE THAT

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:49.570
DECISION TO CLOSE COMMUNITY

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.272
RESOURCES HERE IN THE CITY AND

01:36:51.338 --> 01:36:53.207
THE AREAS OF SACRAMENTO.

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.942
AND JUST LIKE THE CHIEF WAS

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.544
SAYING WHEN THEIR FIRE BROKE OUT

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.145
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER FIRE THAT

01:36:58.212 --> 01:36:59.513
WAS UP IN THE AREA THAT I

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.048
ACTUALLY LIVE IN UP THE CASCADE

01:37:01.115 --> 01:37:01.582
FIRE.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:02.716
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY WAS

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:05.119
COMPLETELY OVERSHADOWED BY THE

01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:06.987
TUBS FIRE BUT AGAIN LIVES WERE

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:09.056
LOST NUMEROUS HOMES WERE LOST UP

01:37:09.123 --> 01:37:10.591
IN THE LIMERICK AREA AS WELL.

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:11.959
AND AGAIN RESOURCES ARE DRAWN

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:14.428
DOWN BUT WE PUT OUR DEPARTMENTS

01:37:14.495 --> 01:37:16.530
AT RISK FROM HAVING TO DELAY

01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:18.332
RESOURCE ORDERING IN FILLING

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.633
SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:20.301
CAL U. S..

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.269
BASED ON OUR CURRENT STAFFING

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.804
LEVELS WHICH ARE TOO LOW SO

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:26.140
AGAIN EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE

01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:27.741
NEED TO IMPROVE OUR STAFFING TO

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.710
SO MANY SUPPORT THAT THE

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:30.811
LEGISLATURE CAN.

01:37:30.878 --> 01:37:36.217
GET HELP EVEN IN THAT VENUE

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:37.184
WOULD BE GREAT FOR US.

01:37:37.251 --> 01:37:38.052
THANK YOU ON A PERCENTAGE BASIS

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:38.619
HOW MUCH OF AN INCREASE IN

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:39.653
STOPPING DO YOU THINK WOULD MAKE

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:41.222
YOUR DEPARTMENT RECENTLY ABLE TO

RESPOND TO THE SEASONS LIKE

01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:42.122
WE'VE SEEN.

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.990
CURRENTLY THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO

01:37:43.057 --> 01:37:45.226
WERE FOUR TO SIX STATIONS BELOW

01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:47.328
OUR WHAT OUR CURRENT STAFFING IS

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:48.796
SHOULD BEEN REPORTED WHICH IS

01:37:48.862 --> 01:37:50.998
BEEN STUDIED MULTIPLE TIMES BUT

01:37:51.065 --> 01:37:51.966
WE STILL HAVE AN ADDED THE

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:53.367
RESOURCES THAT WE NEED.

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:55.135
JUST RECENTLY WE'VE TRIED TO RE

01:37:55.202 --> 01:37:56.303
OPEN ONE OF OUR STATIONS IT WAS

BASIS TO GET US TO WHERE WE

SHOULD BE I WOULD ALMOST SAY WE

01:38:03.177 --> 01:38:05.045
NEED ANOTHER TWENTY TO THIRTY

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:05.379
FIREFIGHTERS.

01:38:05.446 --> 01:38:07.348

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.040
STATE OF THE ART.

SERIOUSLY THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:55.929

OF CREATING THE KINDS OF

01:39:11.979 --> 01:39:13.681
TECHNOLOGY.

01:39:13.747 --> 01:39:15.316
RESOURCES IF THEY USE THEM NOW

01:39:15.382 --> 01:39:17.718

TEMPERATURES VERY HUMIDITY VERY

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:25.526
EASY EVEN SMALL MICRO CLIMATES.

01:39:25.592 --> 01:39:27.294
THE WIND IS HIGHER IN CERTAIN

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:32.499
PLACES AND CAN BE TESTED WAS

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:33.500
SOME OF THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY THE

01:39:33.567 --> 01:39:34.034
THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES

01:39:34.101 --> 01:39:35.636
AVAILABLE THAT THE UTILITY

01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:36.637
COMPANY SHOULD BE USING.

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:37.971
WELL LET'S ASSUME THAT THEY

01:39:38.038 --> 01:39:40.674

AND TO STOP THESE FIRES BEFORE

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:56.123
THEY BLOW OUT OF CONTROL.

01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.758
I'LL START A FEEL GOOD -- SO FOR

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:04.498
WE USED TO A PRE POSITIONING

01:40:04.565 --> 01:40:05.232
WITH EVERYONE OF THEM AND WE

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:08.202

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:13.207
SESSION SO WE HAD A STRIKE TEAM

01:40:13.273 --> 01:40:15.242
ADDITIONAL FOR OUR OP AREA WHICH

01:40:15.309 --> 01:40:17.211
IS CINEMA COUNTY FIVE ENGINES

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:17.778
THAT'S HELPFUL BUT IT'S NOT

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:18.912
QUITE ENOUGH.

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.681
THE COUNTY ALSO LET US UP STAFF

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.583
THEY PUT SOME FUNDING ASIDE FOR

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.283
THAT.

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.351
AS WELL SO WE HAD A TASK FORCE

01:40:24.418 --> 01:40:25.486
RESTRICTING WE HAD TEN

01:40:25.552 --> 01:40:27.855
ADDITIONAL ENGINES -- THAT WE

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:31.291
USED TO HELP DURING THESE THESE

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.326
RED FLAG WARNINGS.

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:35.496
NOW THERE ARE MANY RED FLAGS AND

01:40:35.562 --> 01:40:36.497
THESE.

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:38.432
THE THOUGH THE ONES THAT KEEP ME

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:40.601
UP AT NIGHT ARE THE ONES THAT

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.604
HAPPENED ON OCTOBER TWENTY

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.706
SEVENTEEN WHEN YOU HAVE FORTY

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:47.107
FIFTY SIXTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS.

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.609
WERE I'VE BEEN WORKING IN A

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:49.610
LITTLE BIT OF WORK WITH SAN JOSE

01:40:49.676 --> 01:40:51.545
STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:52.946
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND

01:40:53.013 --> 01:40:53.247
IT'S LIKE.

01:40:53.313 --> 01:40:55.649
HOW DO YOU WE NEED A LOW NOT A

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:58.018
RED FLAG WE NEED THE PURPLE FLAG

01:40:58.085 --> 01:40:59.219
FOR THE BLACK FLAG?

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:02.256
THE 1% WEATHER SYSTEM THAT'S

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:02.990
GOING TO CAUSE THIS KIND OF

01:41:03.056 --> 01:41:04.992
DAMAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU

01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:07.461
CAN REALLY SATURATED AREA AND IT

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:09.196
CAN'T JUST BE AN **** OF SANTA

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:09.930
ROSA.

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:11.532
IT'S GOT TO BE AND NAPA COUNTIES

01:41:11.598 --> 01:41:12.866
GOT TO BE IN LAKE COUNTY IT'S

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:15.736
GOT TO BE EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN.

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:17.371
SO WHEN A FIRE DOES HEART THE

01:41:17.438 --> 01:41:18.739
START THEY GET THERE AS QUICK AS

01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:19.072
A CANDIDATE.

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:20.707
THE THE CONTROLLER OR WE GOT

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:26.313
MORE RESOURCES COMMON RIGHT SO.

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.080
AND AND THAT I WILL TELL YOU I

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.582
WAS ON HIGHWAY TWENTY ON OCTOBER

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:29.616
EIGHTH.

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:30.818
AND THE WIND UP WAS INCREDIBLY

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:31.985
STRONG BLOWING FROM THE NORTH TO

01:41:32.052 --> 01:41:33.454
THE SOUTH.

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.121
THAT I'VE NOW I'VE BEEN ON THAT

01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:35.622
ROAD QUITE A BIT I'VE NEVER SEEN

01:41:35.689 --> 01:41:36.857
ONE LIKE THAT AND WHEN I GOT TO

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:38.625
HIDDEN VALLEY I STOPPED TO VISIT

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.927
FAMILY MEMBER AND THERE'S REALLY

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:41.395
NO WHEN IT WAS A LITTLE GUSTY

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.130
BUT REALLY NO WIND.

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:44.131
HOUSE ON TUBS LANE AT SEVEN

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:46.066
O'CLOCK AT NIGHT IT WAS A NORMAL

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:46.800
NIGHT.

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:48.202
BUT THAT ALL CHANGED AND THAT

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:50.003
CHANGE FROM THE WINDS IN THE

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.605
SACRAMENTO VALLEY SO HE WAS SAN

01:41:51.672 --> 01:41:53.307
JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY YOU NEED

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.341
MORE WEATHER STATIONS AND SANTA

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:55.108
ROSA YET I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:55.676
THAT.

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:57.177
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S GOING TO

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.413
ALERT US TO WHAT'S COMING SO WE

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:01.081
NEED SOMETHING IN IN THE VALLEY.

01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:03.484
THAT'S GONNA COME OVER THAT SAME

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:04.918
LEAN AT THE MOUNTAIN WAVE.

01:42:04.985 --> 01:42:07.120
THERE'S SOME WEATHER STATIONS ON

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:10.290
CHANNEL IN AT LEAST TWO THAT I'M

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.559
MORE OF BUT THE IT'S IT'S FOR

01:42:12.626 --> 01:42:14.261
CASTING THOSE BIG WHETHER

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:16.363
ADVANCE IN IN P. JEANNIE -- AS

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.098
PUT UP A LOT OF WEATHER STATIONS

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:20.534
AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:21.401
FACILITIES.

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:22.503
AND THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:23.937
DOING A LOT OF WORK.

01:42:24.004 --> 01:42:25.506
I DON'T KNOW HOW INTEGRATED IT

01:42:25.572 --> 01:42:26.907
IS EVERYONE'S DOING A LITTLE BIT

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:27.741
YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S KIND OF

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.076
TALKING TO EACH OTHER BUT IT'S

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:30.444
NOT COMING TOGETHER.

01:42:30.511 --> 01:42:32.646
SO WHEN THAT INFORMATION COMES

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.414
TO ME IN A PERFECT WORLD GOES --

01:42:34.481 --> 01:42:35.549
TO YES THIS IS LOOK AT WE GOT

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:37.718
THIS ISSUE NOTIFY THESE

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:40.354
COMMUNITIES AND AND THEN IT GOES

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.322
RIGHT DOWN THE LINE TO TO NOTIFY

01:42:42.389 --> 01:42:43.790
THE REST WAS THAT'S WHERE THIS

01:42:43.857 --> 01:42:44.858
FUSION CENTER COMES AND HIGH

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:48.729
LEVEL -- CAN FOR ME AYE AYE.

01:42:48.795 --> 01:42:50.330
IF THERE IS A START WE NEED REAL

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.466
TIME INFORMATION IT IS MOVING IN

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:54.234
THIS DIRECTION AT THIS SPEED.

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:55.536
GET THAT TO THE GROUND LEVEL SO

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:57.170
PEOPLE CAN PREPARE THEIR

01:42:57.237 --> 01:42:59.206
COMMUNITIES TO GET OUT.

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:01.241
AS FOR USING CAMERAS FOR IF WE

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:03.110
SEE FAR LESS MOVING FAST WE'RE

01:43:03.176 --> 01:43:03.644
DOING.

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:05.512
IS ACTIVATIONS WE'RE NOT WAITING.

01:43:05.579 --> 01:43:06.980
AND IN SOME CASES WE GOT

01:43:07.047 --> 01:43:08.582
CRITICIZED FOR NOT EVACUATING

01:43:08.649 --> 01:43:10.384
QUICK ENOUGH IN OTHER CASES WE

01:43:10.450 --> 01:43:11.718
ARE CRITICIZED BECAUSE IT WAS

01:43:11.785 --> 01:43:13.020
TOO BIG OF AN AREA.

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:14.655
AND ALSO YOU SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T

01:43:14.721 --> 01:43:16.189
WIN BUT I'M GOING TO GIVE MY

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:18.992
COMMUNITY EVERY CHANCE I GET. TO

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:19.826
GET OUT OF THERE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.595
NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA STOP THAT

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.263
YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:23.530
THE WAY.

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.599
AND THEN.

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:26.166
PUT THE FIRE OUT AS IT COMES

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:29.136
THROUGH IN FOR US WE CAN CONTROL

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:29.670
TO WIN SHIFTED THAT DIDN'T

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:35.208
HAPPEN TO ABOUT FIVE IN THE

01:43:35.275 --> 01:43:36.610
MORNING SO MY QUESTION IS.

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:37.578
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING.

01:43:37.644 --> 01:43:38.579
TO TAKE THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:43:38.645 --> 01:43:39.780
NEED TO BE DEVELOPED BY THE

01:43:39.846 --> 01:43:42.182
UTILITY COMPANIES WHOSE HOLES

01:43:42.249 --> 01:43:43.650
AND WHAT HAVE YOU HAVE BECAUSE

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.452
OF THE WINDS OR WHATEVER IT IS.

01:43:45.519 --> 01:43:47.688
HAVE TO HAVE IT INSTIGATED THESE

01:43:47.754 --> 01:43:49.156
FIRES AND WHAT HAVEYOU.

01:43:49.222 --> 01:43:52.225
IS THERE SOME RELATIONSHIP THAT

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:54.895
ALREADY EXISTS OR THAT -- IT

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:56.863
SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD EXIST SO

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:57.764
THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH

01:43:57.831 --> 01:43:59.533
THE INFORMATION THEY GIVE YOU A

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:00.701
HEADS UP THAT THERE IS A AN

01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:03.637
EVENT THAT 1% YOU TALK ABOUT FOR

01:44:03.704 --> 01:44:07.174
PERHAPS -- IS THAT SOMETHING

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:08.241
THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL.

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:09.343
IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:10.711
LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF POLICY

01:44:10.777 --> 01:44:12.679
REQUIRING THAT THERE BE THAT

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:14.114
INNER CONNECTIVITY THAT

01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:16.049
COLLABORATION WITH LOCALS WHEN

01:44:16.116 --> 01:44:16.817
THEY HAVE TO GET THIS

01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:19.019
INFORMATION SO THAT YOU THEN GET

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.921

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:27.352
DEVELOP A SELF SUSTAINING MODEL

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.854
WE CAN'T FUNDED THIS FOREVER.

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:32.157
IT NEEDS TO FIND A WAY TO BE AN

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:33.492
ECONOMICALLY VIABLE.

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:36.562

OUR PUBLIC.

02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:46.004
AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE OF

02:10:46.071 --> 02:10:48.140
ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- MUTUAL AID

02:10:48.207 --> 02:10:51.043
SYSTEM IS IS INCREDIBLE AND I

02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:52.578
WON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE THAN

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:54.646
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE SO MUCH HAS

02:10:54.713 --> 02:10:58.050
BEEN SAID -- BUT WHAT WE NEED TO

02:10:58.116 --> 02:10:59.985
UNDERSTAND IS THAT THAT THE

02:11:00.052 --> 02:11:01.153
PUBLIC.

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:03.088
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE IN

02:11:03.155 --> 02:11:04.489
CALIFORNIA EVERY SINGLE

02:11:04.556 --> 02:11:07.059
CALIFORNIA.

02:11:07.125 --> 02:11:10.395
IS THE KEY TO THIS PROBLEM.

02:11:10.462 --> 02:11:12.331
WE NEED TO GET TO EVERY SINGLE

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:13.765
ONE AND EXPLAIN AND HELP THEM

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:16.235
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WILD FIRE

02:11:16.301 --> 02:11:17.836
DOES MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM.

02:11:17.903 --> 02:11:18.904
NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:20.572
CALIFORNIA.

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.908
ALSO -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW

02:11:22.975 --> 02:11:26.078
THAT 95% OF ALL WILDLAND FIRES

02:11:26.144 --> 02:11:28.647
ARE CAUSED BY HUMANS.

02:11:28.714 --> 02:11:29.948
THAT MEANS THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:31.950
PREVENTABLE.

02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:34.853
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FIRES

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.290
ARE ACCIDENTALLY STARTED -- OR

02:11:38.357 --> 02:11:40.492
STARTED WITHOUT IT ANYBODY EVEN

02:11:40.559 --> 02:11:42.728
KNOWING THAT IT HAPPENED.

02:11:42.794 --> 02:11:45.197
THOSE CAN BE PREVENTED.

02:11:45.264 --> 02:11:48.100
EDUCATION TO THOSE ENDS -- NEEDS

02:11:48.166 --> 02:11:50.202

EVERY LARGE -- MEDIA MARKET --

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:13.525
WE DID THAT WITH OUR LOCAL AND

02:13:06.611 --> 02:13:08.080
IS RIGHT.

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:09.581
IT'S IMPORTANT ON DIVERT

02:13:09.648 --> 02:13:12.217
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTIONS WE

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:14.386
WE HEARD -- SOME OF THE CONCERN

02:13:14.453 --> 02:13:16.621
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS

02:13:16.688 --> 02:13:19.091
AND I A I DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.726
NEED WE COULD DO BETTER AND WE

02:13:20.792 --> 02:13:21.727
NEED TO DO MORE.

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:24.196
INSPECTIONS -- WHAT IT IS

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:26.832
IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS -- CAL FIRE

02:13:26.898 --> 02:13:29.634
STATISTICS SHOW THAT. 82% OF

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:31.903
HOMES THAT ARE INSPECTED.

02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:34.272
PASSED ON THEIR FIRST INSPECTION

02:13:34.339 --> 02:13:36.108
SO THAT MEANS 82% OF THE

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:38.043
INSPECTIONS THAT WE'RE DOING ON

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.778
THE FIRST PASS.

02:13:39.845 --> 02:13:42.180
AS A COMPLIANT HOUSEHOLD.

02:13:42.247 --> 02:13:44.383
BY THE THIRD INSPECTION WHICH IS

02:13:44.449 --> 02:13:46.284
THE THE INSPECTION WHEN ON OF OF

02:13:46.351 --> 02:13:49.521
VIOLATION IS WRITTEN. 92%.

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:53.392
SO OF THOSE THE PERCENTAGE OF OF

02:13:53.458 --> 02:13:56.027
OF ITS 8% ROUGHLY.

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:57.629
OF THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE NOT

02:13:57.696 --> 02:13:58.897
COMPLIANT.

02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:01.166
AND THEN A PORTION OF THOSE THAT

02:14:01.233 --> 02:14:05.337
ARE GOING -- TO TO A ABATEMENT

02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:07.038
TYPE OF SITUATION.

02:14:07.105 --> 02:14:09.174
AND OF COURSE THAT DOES VERY

02:14:09.241 --> 02:14:09.775
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE DO

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:11.209
NOT.

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:13.678
INSPECT EVERY STRUCTURE.

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:17.082
SO SO THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR FOR

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:19.117
SOME SOME -- SOME SLOPPING HERE

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:21.453
FOR SURE -- THE GOAL FOR

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.022
CALIFORNIA -- IS TO GET TO IN

02:14:24.089 --> 02:14:26.291
THE WILDLAND AREAS THE THE STATE

02:14:26.358 --> 02:14:28.160
RESPONSIBILITY AREA. TWO HUNDRED

02:14:28.226 --> 02:14:30.262
AND FIFTY THOUSAND INSPECTIONS

02:14:30.328 --> 02:14:33.131
ANNUALLY-- WE ARE HALF WAY TO

02:14:33.198 --> 02:14:34.533
THAT GOAL.

02:14:34.599 --> 02:14:37.335
AND EXPECT TO BE VERY CLOSE TO

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:39.104
MEETING THAT TARGET THIS YEAR IF

02:14:39.171 --> 02:14:41.807
WE GET TO THAT THAT'S ONCE EVERY

02:14:41.873 --> 02:14:43.408
THREE YEARS WE'RE INSPECTING

02:14:43.475 --> 02:14:44.443
EACH HOME.

02:14:44.509 --> 02:14:47.279
NOT EVERY YEAR.

02:14:47.345 --> 02:14:49.147
STRUCTURE HARDENING IS

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:50.248
ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT.

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:52.984
AND AS I SAID THE THE APP WILL

02:14:53.051 --> 02:14:53.185
HELP.

02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:55.153
US TO GET THEIR LAND USE

02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:57.622
PLANNING -- CODE CODE

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:59.591
ENFORCEMENT AND AND ENSURING

02:14:59.658 --> 02:15:00.258
THAT.

02:15:00.325 --> 02:15:02.461
THAT -- WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING

02:15:02.527 --> 02:15:04.629
WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENCOURAGE

02:15:04.696 --> 02:15:06.898
RETROFITTING OF HOMES THAT ARE

02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:08.900
EXISTING NON COMPLIANT. TO

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:12.137
EXISTING CODES EXISTING CODES --

02:15:12.204 --> 02:15:13.638
SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN

02:15:13.705 --> 02:15:16.308
PARTICULAR ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

02:15:16.374 --> 02:15:17.742
IN HARDENING HOMES.

02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:19.244
SO THE NEW CONSTRUCTION IS NOT

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:20.445
REALLY A PROBLEM.

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:23.415
IT IS EXISTING NON COMPLIANT AND

02:15:23.482 --> 02:15:24.950
SO WE NEED TO WORK TOWARD THAT

02:15:25.016 --> 02:15:28.186
STRUCTURE HARDENING -- CHIEF OF

02:15:28.253 --> 02:15:29.588
GOZER WAS MENTIONING THE HOME

02:15:29.654 --> 02:15:32.224
THE HOME FIRES AND A FIRE I NEXT

02:15:32.290 --> 02:15:34.593
DOOR FIRE BURNING -- IGNITING A

02:15:34.659 --> 02:15:35.994
HALF OF THE HOUSE NEXT TO IT

02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:37.429
THAT'S A THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

02:15:37.496 --> 02:15:39.297
WE NEED TO GET TO A CRITICAL

02:15:39.364 --> 02:15:41.600
MASS OF HARDENED STRUCTURES IN A

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:43.735
IN A COMMUNITY SO WE DON'T HAVE

02:15:43.802 --> 02:15:47.372
URBAN CONFLAGRATION HAPPENING.

02:15:47.439 --> 02:15:48.006
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THERE IS

02:15:48.073 --> 02:15:49.207
BY.

02:15:49.274 --> 02:15:51.443
REALLY HARDENING THE COMMUNITY

02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:52.978
NOT JUST AT A STRUCTURE THAT

02:15:53.044 --> 02:15:56.715
TIME.

02:15:56.781 --> 02:16:01.586
SO IN CONCLUSION -- I WANT TO I

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:04.089
I CAN'T.

02:16:04.155 --> 02:16:05.824
EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THIS IS A

02:16:05.891 --> 02:16:08.927
MULTI DISCIPLINARY.

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:11.763
ALL TOOLS ALL HANDS.

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.431
ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH THAT

02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:15.233
WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT I THINK

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:17.068
YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM THE

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:18.470
PANELS BEFORE.

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:20.572
IT'S GONNA TAKE FIREFIGHTERS

02:16:20.639 --> 02:16:22.407
FORESTERS LAND.

02:16:22.474 --> 02:16:26.077
PLANNERS -- ENGINEERS.

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:30.081
INSPECTORS ALL OF THESE ELEMENTS --

02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:32.217

WE NEED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND

02:16:34.152 --> 02:16:35.921
THE DIRECTION WE NEEDED TO GO

02:16:35.987 --> 02:16:36.221
[inaudible]

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:39.925
AND ALL OF THIS IS COMING AT A

02:16:39.991 --> 02:16:44.329
GREAT COST -- IT'S IT WAS

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:45.664

02:22:23.835 --> 02:22:25.136
TEAMS ARE BASED IN REDDING

02:22:25.203 --> 02:22:28.573
AUBURN MONTEREY AND TO IN FRESNO

02:22:28.640 --> 02:22:29.974

SUPPRESSION HAND CREWS AND OF

02:22:37.782 --> 02:22:39.217
COURSE WE HAVE QUITE A BIT THE

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:41.386
DEPTH THAT -- IF CALIFORNIANS

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:46.658
TANKERS VERY QUICKLY WE'VE DONE

02:22:46.724 --> 02:22:48.459

02:22:56.834 --> 02:22:58.336
EXTRA LONG.

02:22:58.403 --> 02:22:59.470
AFTER MARKET RDG DIRECTOR OF THE

02:22:59.537 --> 02:23:00.338

COLLEAGUES HERE WE ARE TRULY WON

02:23:03.541 --> 02:23:05.109
T. ONE FIGHTING IN CALIFORNIA

02:23:05.176 --> 02:23:08.212
AND MANAGING THESE VARIOUS --

02:23:08.279 --> 02:23:10.181
CHALLENGES WE HAVE -- YES IS

02:23:10.248 --> 02:23:11.816
RESPONSIBILITY AS I I KNOW YOU

02:23:11.883 --> 02:23:13.551
KNOW IS REALLY THE OVER ARCHING

02:23:13.618 --> 02:23:16.087
COORDINATION OF OF THE STATE'S.

02:23:16.154 --> 02:23:17.989
ABILITY TO PREPARE FOR PLANNED

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:20.425
FOR RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM.

02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:22.994
ALL HAZARD EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:24.195
TODAY OBVIOUSLY WERE FOCUSING ON

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.897
WALL FIRE IN THE PREPAREDNESS

02:23:25.964 --> 02:23:27.398
LEVEL THAT WE'VE WE'VE ALL BEEN

02:23:27.465 --> 02:23:29.067
WORKING ON TO GET THERE.

02:23:29.133 --> 02:23:31.035
I THINK AS A CONTEXT -- WHY

02:23:31.102 --> 02:23:32.337
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT?

02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:35.506
A PLENTY ABOUT -- THE THE FIRES

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:38.476
OF OF LAST YEAR -- I THINK --

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:40.311
IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT --

02:23:40.378 --> 02:23:42.914
SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

02:23:42.981 --> 02:23:44.282
CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED

02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:48.219
HUNDREDS OF OF MAJOR STATE --

02:23:48.286 --> 02:23:51.289
DISASTERS -- WHEN I CALL A MAJOR

02:23:51.356 --> 02:23:53.691
I I MEAN SIGNIFICANT -- VANCE

02:23:53.758 --> 02:23:55.593
THAT HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.362
STRUCTURES LOSS OF LIVES OR

02:23:57.428 --> 02:23:59.597
INFRASTRUCTURE DAMAGE -- AND OUT

02:23:59.664 --> 02:24:02.600
OF THAT OF FOURTEEN OF THOSE --

02:24:02.667 --> 02:24:04.335
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN

02:24:04.402 --> 02:24:05.837
HAPPENED -- DECLARE PRESIDENTIAL

02:24:05.903 --> 02:24:08.006
DISASTER -- DECORATIONS ARE

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:09.540
MAJOR DISASTER DECLARATION IS

02:24:09.607 --> 02:24:11.342
NOT AN EASY TASK TO GET TO A

02:24:11.409 --> 02:24:12.410
PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:14.545
DECLARATION YOU NEED A MINIMUM

02:24:14.612 --> 02:24:16.481
OF ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION

02:24:16.547 --> 02:24:18.116
DOLLARS IN INFRASTRUCTURE LOSS

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:19.350
AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.285
OF OTHER CRITERIA THAT.

02:24:21.352 --> 02:24:23.221
WRAP AROUND THAT AND I SAY THAT

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:25.256
BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS CLEARLY

02:24:25.323 --> 02:24:28.126
HAVE -- CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO

02:24:28.192 --> 02:24:30.862
CHANGE THAT OUR RESULTING IN THE

02:24:30.928 --> 02:24:32.864
ABILITY OF ALL OF US TO HAVE TO

02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:35.666
RESPOND THINK ABOUT RESPOND.

02:24:35.733 --> 02:24:37.535
TO THESE EVENTS IN A MUCH MORE

02:24:37.602 --> 02:24:39.137
AGGRESSIVE MUCH MORE FORWARD

02:24:39.203 --> 02:24:41.939
LEANING FASHION -- IN FACT

02:24:42.006 --> 02:24:44.575
LEADING UP TO THE CAMPFIRE --

02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:46.210
THERE WERE MULTIPLE FIRESTHAT

02:24:46.277 --> 02:24:47.745
WERE TAKING PLACE IN CALIFORNIA

02:24:47.812 --> 02:24:49.414
THERE WAS STRETCHING FIRE AND

02:24:49.480 --> 02:24:51.416
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT EMERGENCY

02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:54.852
SERVICES RESOURCES -- MULTIPLE

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:56.754
FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE --

02:24:56.821 --> 02:24:59.290
AND OF THE OF OF JUST OF THE

02:24:59.357 --> 02:25:01.192
FIFTIES FIRES THE KRANZ THEN THE

02:25:01.259 --> 02:25:03.861
FERGUSON THE CAR THE MENDOCINO

02:25:03.928 --> 02:25:09.834
COMPLEX DOWNHILL THE WALLS THE

02:25:09.901 --> 02:25:11.469
AND THE CAMP OF THOSE FIVE

02:25:11.536 --> 02:25:12.370
RESULTED IN A MAJOR DISASTER

02:25:12.437 --> 02:25:14.038
DECLARATIONS -- AND SO -- THE

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:14.639
THERE WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO

02:25:14.705 --> 02:25:15.306
REALLY BE THINKING THROUGH THIS

02:25:15.373 --> 02:25:16.641
AND HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS

02:25:16.707 --> 02:25:19.377
NEW NORM -- AND PREPARING FOR IT

02:25:19.444 --> 02:25:21.612
IS AN EVOLVING PROCESS THERE IS

02:25:21.679 --> 02:25:23.648
NO SILVER BULLET -- THERE IS NO

02:25:23.714 --> 02:25:26.050
ONE WAY -- IS NOT LINEAR IS

02:25:26.117 --> 02:25:28.286
ASYMMETRIC AND IS REQUIRING US

02:25:28.352 --> 02:25:30.288
TO COMPLETELY COME TOGETHER --

02:25:30.354 --> 02:25:32.056
AS ALL THE ENTITIES NOT JUST AT

02:25:32.123 --> 02:25:33.491
THE STATE LEVEL WITH OUR LOCAL

02:25:33.558 --> 02:25:35.626
PARTNERS PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE

02:25:35.693 --> 02:25:39.497
CITIZENS -- THEMSELVES -- I WANT

02:25:39.564 --> 02:25:41.432
TO TALK A LOT ABOUT -- SOME OF

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:43.234
THE KEY AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:45.770
WORKING ON OVER ARCHING FOR

02:25:45.837 --> 02:25:47.438
PREPAREDNESS I WANT TO START OFF.

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:47.805
IN THE AREA OF

02:25:47.872 --> 02:25:50.074
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THIS

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:51.642
IS ONE AREA THAT.

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:55.713
IS A IN MANY WAYS A WEAK LINK IN

02:25:55.780 --> 02:25:58.816
THE OVER ARCHING ABILITY TO BE

02:25:58.883 --> 02:26:01.018
ABLE TO GET MUCH OF WHAT YOU'VE

02:26:01.085 --> 02:26:02.286
HEARD HERE THIS MORNING.

02:26:02.353 --> 02:26:03.955
STARTING WITH GOOD SITUATIONAL

02:26:04.021 --> 02:26:05.056
AWARENESS.

02:26:05.123 --> 02:26:07.058
BUT IN FACT THE ABILITY TO

02:26:07.125 --> 02:26:08.726
COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC AND

02:26:08.793 --> 02:26:11.162
EMERGENCY AND TO COMMUNICATE

02:26:11.229 --> 02:26:13.898
AMONGST -- RESPOND HERS --

02:26:13.965 --> 02:26:16.367
INEFFECTIVE WAY -- SO MUCH OF

02:26:16.434 --> 02:26:18.369
OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS --

02:26:18.436 --> 02:26:19.537
OUTSIDE OF LAND MOBILE RADIO

02:26:19.604 --> 02:26:21.205
CAPABILITY IN THE STATE'S

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:22.440
MICROWAVE NETWORK.

02:26:22.507 --> 02:26:25.309
HAS GONE TO THE USE OF THE

02:26:25.376 --> 02:26:27.445
CELLULAR NETWORK -- AND THE

02:26:27.512 --> 02:26:29.647
INTERNET OF THINGS WE USE THAT

02:26:29.714 --> 02:26:31.816
FOR DATA PUSHING WE USE THAT IN

02:26:31.883 --> 02:26:32.917
OUR NIGHT WHEN ONE CENTERS WE

02:26:32.984 --> 02:26:34.318
USE THAT.

02:26:34.385 --> 02:26:36.220
ACROSS THE BOARD IN -- ABILITY

02:26:36.287 --> 02:26:37.388
TO COMMUNICATE.

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:40.691
THAT ENTIRE SYSTEM IS NOT OWNED.

02:26:40.758 --> 02:26:42.627
NOR CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNMENT

02:26:42.693 --> 02:26:44.829
IS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY THE

02:26:44.896 --> 02:26:46.097
PRIVATE SECTOR.

02:26:46.164 --> 02:26:48.633
AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE THROWING

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:50.168
LITERALLY ALL OF OUR EGGS IN

02:26:50.234 --> 02:26:51.502
THAT BASKET TO THE HIGHEST

02:26:51.569 --> 02:26:54.005
DEGREE -- AND WE ARE MOVING

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:55.840
FORWARD IN THAT EVEN AS THE

02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:57.542
PUBLIC USING USE OF OF

02:26:57.608 --> 02:26:58.176
CELLPHONES.

02:26:58.242 --> 02:26:59.810
WE HAVE BECOME DEPENDENT UPON

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:01.546
BEING ABLE TO GET GOOD CLEAN

02:27:01.612 --> 02:27:03.748
CLEAR COMMUNICATIONS AND WE TALK

02:27:03.814 --> 02:27:08.085
ABOUT ISSUING A LORTON WARNINGS

02:27:08.152 --> 02:27:09.287
AND PUSHING OUT.

02:27:09.353 --> 02:27:09.954
CRITICAL DATA TO INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:27:10.021 --> 02:27:10.922
ARE IN.

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:12.089
THE ADVANCE OF A FAST MOVING

02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:14.492
WILDFIRE.

02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:15.860
THAT SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE

02:27:15.927 --> 02:27:17.662
RESILIENT AND RE DONE DEBT AND

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.764
STAND UP THE ABILITY TO

02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:21.899
WITHSTAND THAT FIRE SITUATION SO

02:27:21.966 --> 02:27:23.334
THAT COMMUNICATIONS CAN STILL

02:27:23.401 --> 02:27:24.869
TAKE PLACE.

02:27:24.936 --> 02:27:25.369
FORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:29.106
HAPPENING -- THE ABILITY -- TO

02:27:29.173 --> 02:27:31.676
HAVE A RESILIENT AND HARDENED

02:27:31.742 --> 02:27:33.644
TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:35.346
IS STILL A WEAK LINK IN THE

02:27:35.413 --> 02:27:37.381
SYSTEM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:27:37.448 --> 02:27:39.116
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

02:27:39.183 --> 02:27:40.952
OUR PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS. TO

02:27:41.018 --> 02:27:42.486
BILL WHAT I CALL PUBLIC SAFETY

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:45.423
GRADE COMMUNICATIONS HARDLY THAT

02:27:45.489 --> 02:27:47.258
IS DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT IS

02:27:47.325 --> 02:27:49.393
EMERGENCY POWER BATTERY OR

02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:50.995
GENERATOR BACK UP.

02:27:51.062 --> 02:27:53.130
THAT IS A HARDENING OF THE BACK

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:55.766
HALL FIBER LINES THAT ARE

02:27:55.833 --> 02:27:57.668
CRITICAL FOR MOVING THE DATA IN

02:27:57.735 --> 02:27:59.604
EFFECTIVE MANNER -- THIS IS VERY

02:27:59.670 --> 02:28:01.939
IMPORTANT FOR US BECAUSE WE ARE

02:28:02.006 --> 02:28:04.642
MOVING -- TO THE ENHANCEMENT OF

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:06.010
OUR NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM BUT

02:28:06.077 --> 02:28:07.144
WE'RE ALSO MOVING TO SOMETHING

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:08.646
CALL FIRST AT WHICH IS A

02:28:08.713 --> 02:28:10.281
BROADBAND BEING.

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:12.917
CAPABILITY WAR INNER -- INTER

02:28:12.984 --> 02:28:13.918
OPERABILITY IN OUR

02:28:13.985 --> 02:28:15.453
COMMUNICATIONS ACROSS THE BOARD

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:17.989
WITH ALL PUBLIC SAFETY RESPONDER.

02:28:18.055 --> 02:28:19.457
ALL OF THAT IS DRIVEN BY A

02:28:19.523 --> 02:28:21.826
SYSTEM WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.361
SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR

02:28:23.427 --> 02:28:25.162
MOVING FORWARD -- AND THE

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:26.464
ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT THAT.

02:28:26.530 --> 02:28:29.133
THAT THE SYSTEM IS OPERATIONAL.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.368
THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'RE DOING

02:28:30.434 --> 02:28:32.003
IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AS THE

02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:33.638
ENTITY IN THE STATE THAT MANAGES

02:28:33.704 --> 02:28:35.740
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS IS

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:38.342
MOVING -- TO UPGRADE OUR NIGHT

02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:40.811
WHEN ONE SYSTEM -- AND MOVING TO

02:28:40.878 --> 02:28:42.213
NEXT GENERATION I WOULD WANT AND

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.448
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW OUR NINE ONE

02:28:44.515 --> 02:28:45.750
ONE SYSTEM WHICH WAS BUILT IN

02:28:45.816 --> 02:28:48.753
THE SEVENTIES -- AND HAS REALLY

02:28:48.819 --> 02:28:52.123
BEEN A PHENOMENAL CAPABILITY --

02:28:52.189 --> 02:28:55.126
NOW IS REALLY PAST ITS PRIME AND

02:28:55.192 --> 02:28:57.061
IS AT IS IS REALLY BEING HELD

02:28:57.128 --> 02:28:59.463
TOGETHER -- AT YOU KNOW AS WE

02:28:59.530 --> 02:29:02.466
ARE MOVING FORWARD AND WE NEED --

02:29:02.533 --> 02:29:05.536
TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM IMPROVE IT --

02:29:05.603 --> 02:29:06.804
THAT WILL THEN 'LL HAVE A

02:29:06.871 --> 02:29:08.873
CASCADING IMPACT ON THE THE THE

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:09.907
THE DIFFERENT AREAS ALL TALK

02:29:09.974 --> 02:29:11.375
ABOUT A MINUTE IN SITUATION

02:29:11.442 --> 02:29:12.443
AWARENESS.

02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:18.182
AND ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE --

02:29:18.249 --> 02:29:19.250
I'LL START OFF WITH THE NEXT GEN

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:20.484
NIGHT WHEN ONE WHICH IS REALLY

02:29:20.551 --> 02:29:21.986
MOVING -- TO AND IP BASED SYSTEM

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:22.787

RIGHT NOW IN MANY CASES THESE

02:35:27.084 --> 02:35:29.753
FAST MOVING FIRES ARE MOVING SO

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:32.956

HAPPENING AND SO PART OF THAT

02:35:40.397 --> 02:35:42.099
CAN BE DRIVEN BY INCREASING THE

02:35:42.166 --> 02:35:43.600
MUCH OF THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:44.802

02:36:28.145 --> 02:36:31.281
IT HAS THE ABILITY TO BRING IN.

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:32.750
THE CAMERAS THAT ARE BEEN TALKED

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:36.053
ABOUT THE SATELLITE DATA --

02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:38.622
RADIO COMMUNICATIONS IT ALSO HAS

LOCATOR ON THE SHOW A QUICK

02:36:54.772 --> 02:36:56.473
MINUTE WE CAN SEE THOSE STRIKE

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:58.509
TEAMS MOVING AND MUCH OF LOCAL

POSITIONING CAPABILITY --

02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:10.754
CURRENTLY THAT THAT SCOUT IS

02:37:10.821 --> 02:37:12.256
USED IN THE FIELD IN THE

02:37:12.322 --> 02:37:14.124
INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS AS

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:16.460

THE SILVER BULLET AND WE

02:37:35.412 --> 02:37:36.547
CONTINUE TO BUILD.

02:37:36.613 --> 02:37:42.886
ON ALL OF THAT -- SEVERAL OTHER

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:43.887
AREAS THAT -- WE HAVE BEEN

THAT HAVE A A CRITICAL COMPONENT --

02:37:47.324 --> 02:37:48.559
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE CAMERAS

02:37:48.625 --> 02:37:51.895
THERE'S ALSO THE ABILITY TO DO --

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:53.363

KINDS OF EVENTS WHERE WE CAPTURE

02:38:11.281 --> 02:38:12.783
THAT INFORMATION AND THEN AND

02:38:12.850 --> 02:38:13.951
THEN WE ARE PUT INTO AN

ALGORITHM TO BE ABLE TO GIVES US

02:38:15.886 --> 02:38:16.520
SOME.

02:38:16.587 --> 02:38:18.622

HAD TO WAIT FOR A FEW HOURS.

02:43:42.212 --> 02:43:45.682
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS REALLY.

02:43:45.749 --> 02:43:47.784
TO GO BACK TO TECHNOLOGY AND

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:49.819
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO BE ABLE TO

02:43:49.886 --> 02:43:52.222
HAVE GOOD SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

02:43:52.289 --> 02:43:54.424
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING SO WE LOOK

02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.459
AT THINGS LIKE.

02:43:56.526 --> 02:44:00.864
FIRE WEATHER -- FUELS CONDITION --

02:44:00.931 --> 02:44:02.966
INTELLIGENCE ARE ON UP FROM

02:44:03.033 --> 02:44:05.769
SATELLITE IMAGERY CLIMATOLOGY --

02:44:05.835 --> 02:44:08.138
AND THIS IS WHERE YOU HER CHIEF

02:44:08.205 --> 02:44:09.139
GOZER MUCH TIME SEVERAL TIMES

02:44:09.206 --> 02:44:11.641
FUSION FUSION CENTER IT'S REALLY

02:44:11.708 --> 02:44:13.343
THIS ABILITY THROUGH THE

02:44:13.410 --> 02:44:15.645
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN GEOGRAPHIC

02:44:15.712 --> 02:44:18.882
AREA AS THE THE INCIDENT.

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:20.183
LOOKING AT THE WEATHER DATA.

02:44:20.250 --> 02:44:22.652
I'M LOOKING AT THE TOPOGRAPHY

02:44:22.719 --> 02:44:25.021
ASSESSING THE FIRE CORRIDORS

02:44:25.088 --> 02:44:26.790
PASS FIRE HISTORY.

02:44:26.856 --> 02:44:27.891
AND THEN BEING ABLE TO MAKE

02:44:27.958 --> 02:44:30.594
RECOMMENDATIONS -- UP THROUGH

02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:32.095
THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER

02:44:32.162 --> 02:44:33.530
WHERE WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT

02:44:33.597 --> 02:44:35.999
THE STATE WIDE PICTURE TO SAY

02:44:36.066 --> 02:44:38.401
LOOK THIS IS A HIGH POTENTIAL

02:44:38.468 --> 02:44:39.736
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET A FIRE

02:44:39.803 --> 02:44:43.006
SO NOW WHEN THERE'S A RED FLAG

02:44:43.073 --> 02:44:44.174
CONDITION.

02:44:44.241 --> 02:44:44.908
WHERE THEY USED TO SAY WELL

02:44:44.975 --> 02:44:45.475
WE'RE GONNA OF A RED FLAG

02:44:45.542 --> 02:44:46.810
CONDITION IT'S GOING TO BE OVER

02:44:46.876 --> 02:44:48.745
EIGHT COUNTIES WHAT EXACTLY DOES

02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:49.946
THAT MEAN?

02:44:50.013 --> 02:44:51.081
A RED FLAG CONDITION OVER A

02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:53.850
COUNTIES WITH THIS.

02:44:53.917 --> 02:44:55.452
EFFORT IN THE DIRECTION THAT

02:44:55.518 --> 02:44:58.722
WE'RE MOVING IT IS TO BRING THAT.

02:44:58.788 --> 02:45:01.625
THAT WHETHER THREATEN DOWN TO

02:45:01.691 --> 02:45:03.960
THOSE KEY AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:06.396
POTENTIAL. FOR FIRE STARTS SO

02:45:06.463 --> 02:45:07.464
WHERE THE WINDS ARE GOING TO BE

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.431
THE WORST WERE THE FEW

02:45:08.498 --> 02:45:09.833
CONDITIONS ARE THE WORST WITH

02:45:09.899 --> 02:45:11.368
THE HUMIDITY IS THE LOWEST WITH

02:45:11.434 --> 02:45:12.869
THE TEMPERATURES THE HIGHEST.

02:45:12.936 --> 02:45:14.871
ECCENTRIC AND WE TIE THE CAMERAS

02:45:14.938 --> 02:45:16.873
IN ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGIES TO BE

02:45:16.940 --> 02:45:19.209
ABLE TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT AND

02:45:19.276 --> 02:45:20.610
IT'S THAT POINT.

02:45:20.677 --> 02:45:22.212
EVEN PRIOR TO THE FIRE STARTING

02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:24.047
AT THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH

02:45:24.114 --> 02:45:25.248
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT THE REQUEST

02:45:25.315 --> 02:45:27.150
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR IN

02:45:27.217 --> 02:45:29.052
SUPPORT OF WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO

02:45:29.119 --> 02:45:30.687
TO MOVE. TO PREVENTIVE AT WE

02:45:30.754 --> 02:45:34.524
WILL PRE POSITION -- ASSETS --

02:45:34.591 --> 02:45:36.926
INTO -- AN AREA AND WE DID THAT

02:45:36.993 --> 02:45:39.129
ALMOST A HUNDRED TIMES -- THIS

02:45:39.195 --> 02:45:42.232
LAST YEAR -- AND IN FACT -- SOME

02:45:42.299 --> 02:45:45.302
SOME VERY -- POSITIVE SUCCESS

02:45:45.368 --> 02:45:48.305
STORIES IN BEING ABLE TO HAVE

02:45:48.371 --> 02:45:49.606
THOSE RESOURCES.

02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:52.242
IN PLACE STANDING BY IN ADVANCE

02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:54.311
AND AND IN EACH CASE -- EVENTS

02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:56.546
HAPPENED WHERE WE ACTUALLY MOVED

02:45:56.613 --> 02:45:57.914
ARE WE SURFACTANTS IN SANTA

02:45:57.981 --> 02:45:59.883
BARBARA ONE OF THE FIRST ONES WE

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:02.519
DID -- WE HAD A A STRIKE TEAM

02:46:02.585 --> 02:46:05.522
STAGED -- AT THE CATHEDRAL OAKS

02:46:05.588 --> 02:46:07.524
FIRE STATION -- WHEN THERE WAS A

02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:09.426
SON DOWN A WIN CONDITION THE

02:46:09.492 --> 02:46:11.027
FIRE STARTED THE STRIKE THE

02:46:11.094 --> 02:46:12.996
RESPONSE TO THE HOLIDAY FIRE AND

02:46:13.063 --> 02:46:14.264
THEY WOULD LITERALLY ON C.

02:46:14.331 --> 02:46:15.432
WITHIN MINUTES?

02:46:15.498 --> 02:46:17.267
OF THAT WAS AN AUGMENTATION TO

02:46:17.334 --> 02:46:18.535
THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES THAT

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:20.870
RESPONDED AND THESE ARE JUST

02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:21.838
FIRE STRIKE TEAMS THESE --

02:46:21.905 --> 02:46:24.341
FIREFIGHTERS FIRE ENGINES

02:46:24.407 --> 02:46:26.042
HELICOPTERS INCIDENT MANAGEMENT

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:27.711
TEAMS AND IN OTHER KINDS OF

02:46:27.777 --> 02:46:29.546
THREATS WE MOVE SWIFT WATER

02:46:29.612 --> 02:46:31.114
RESCUE TEAMS URBAN SEARCH AND

02:46:31.181 --> 02:46:33.183
RESCUE TEAMS WHATEVER THE NEEDS

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:35.051
ARE WE CAN PRE POSITION AND IT'S

02:46:35.118 --> 02:46:36.886
A MAJOR STEP FORWARD.

02:46:36.953 --> 02:46:40.357
IN OUR ABILITY -- TO TO BUILD

02:46:40.423 --> 02:46:44.594
THE CAPABILITY TO DEAL WITH THE

02:46:44.661 --> 02:46:47.497
NEW NORM -- SO IN PLANNING

02:46:47.564 --> 02:46:48.898
TRAINING IN AND EXERCISES --

02:46:48.965 --> 02:46:50.066
THERE IS A LOT HAPPENING WE

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:52.435
GUARDING -- WORK WITH OUR LOCAL

02:46:52.502 --> 02:46:54.204
COUNTERPARTS NOT JUST IN FIRE

02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:55.972
BUT IN THE OTHER DISCIPLINES WE

02:46:56.039 --> 02:46:57.107
HAVE MUTUAL AID REGIONAL

02:46:57.173 --> 02:46:58.808
COORDINATION MEETINGS --

02:46:58.875 --> 02:47:00.510
THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- AT OUR

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:01.945
CALIFORNIA SPECIALIZED TRAINING

02:47:02.011 --> 02:47:04.881
INSTITUTE -- WORKING WITHOUT A

02:47:04.948 --> 02:47:06.549
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS DOING

02:47:06.616 --> 02:47:08.118
OF EXCEPTIONAL NUMBER OF

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.953
TRAINING AND EXERCISES -- TO

02:47:10.019 --> 02:47:11.521
BRING EVERYBODY UP TO SPEED WITH

02:47:11.588 --> 02:47:14.591
REGARDS -- TO THE ABILITY.

02:47:14.657 --> 02:47:16.059
TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND.

02:47:16.126 --> 02:47:18.428
BUT THERE'S MORE TO DO -- AS WE

02:47:18.495 --> 02:47:20.230
CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:47:20.296 --> 02:47:21.564
THREAT AND UNDERSTAND THE

02:47:21.631 --> 02:47:24.601
HIGHEST RISK AREAS WITH.

02:47:24.667 --> 02:47:26.503
LOSING SIGHT THAT WE OFFER

02:47:26.569 --> 02:47:28.171
EARTHQUAKE FAULTS AND OTHER

02:47:28.238 --> 02:47:28.938
KINDS OF RISKS THAT WE HAVE IN

02:47:29.005 --> 02:47:30.840
THE STATE -- BALANCING THAT OUT

02:47:30.907 --> 02:47:32.475
AND LOOKING AT FROM ALL HAS OUR

02:47:32.542 --> 02:47:35.078
PERSPECTIVE ONE KEY AREA THAT WE

02:47:35.145 --> 02:47:37.614
ARE -- HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IS

02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:39.082
THE ISSUE OF HAZARD MITIGATION.

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:42.585
AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:44.053
HAZARD MITIGATION PROJECTS AS

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:46.423
YOU AS YOU ALL KNOW -- EVERY

02:47:46.489 --> 02:47:47.957
DOLLAR INVESTED HAZARD

02:47:48.024 --> 02:47:49.926
MITIGATION -- RESULTS AN AVERAGE

02:47:49.993 --> 02:47:52.195
OF SIX DOLLARS SAVED --

02:47:52.262 --> 02:47:53.263
PREVENTING THE LOSS OR

02:47:53.329 --> 02:47:54.731
PREVENTING DAMAGE FROM A

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:57.367
DISASTER AND SO WE WORK --

02:47:57.434 --> 02:47:59.269
EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR LOCAL

02:47:59.335 --> 02:48:01.371
AUTHORITIES TO TRY TO GET -- AS

02:48:01.438 --> 02:48:03.473
MANY -- HAZARD MITIGATION

02:48:03.540 --> 02:48:05.775
PROJECTS IN PLACE -- BEFORE THE

02:48:05.842 --> 02:48:09.846
EVENT PRE DISASTER MITIGATION

02:48:09.913 --> 02:48:11.080
BUT THE WAY THAT THIS PROGRAM

02:48:11.147 --> 02:48:11.714
WORKS WHICH IS REALLY FUNDED BY

02:48:11.781 --> 02:48:12.682
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT

02:48:12.749 --> 02:48:14.484
WE GET UP 220%.

02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:15.718
OF THE COST OF A FEDERAL

02:48:15.785 --> 02:48:18.588
DISASTER AFTER THE DISASTER TO

02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:21.624
BE ABLE TO GO IN AND BY DOWN THE

02:48:21.691 --> 02:48:23.626
RISK OF FUTURE DISASTER LOSSES

02:48:23.693 --> 02:48:25.261
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE FOURTEEN

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:25.728
PRESIDENTIAL DISASTER

02:48:25.795 --> 02:48:26.496
DECLARATION IS.

02:48:26.563 --> 02:48:28.264
SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

02:48:28.331 --> 02:48:29.866
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF MONEY COMING

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:32.969
INTO THE STATE WITH REGARDS --

02:48:33.036 --> 02:48:34.938
TO ABILITY TO DO -- DISASTER

02:48:35.004 --> 02:48:36.306
MITIGATION CLOSE TO A BILLION

02:48:36.372 --> 02:48:38.775
DOLLARS SO -- IN A GOOD FOR

02:48:38.842 --> 02:48:40.443
EXAMPLE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE

02:48:40.510 --> 02:48:41.878
HAD A HUNDRED THIRTY SIX

02:48:41.945 --> 02:48:44.180
PROJECTS -- THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

02:48:44.247 --> 02:48:47.050
TOTALING CLOSE THE THREE OVER

02:48:47.116 --> 02:48:48.651
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:48:48.718 --> 02:48:50.019
THEY DID EVERYTHING FROM.

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:50.787
HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

02:48:50.854 --> 02:48:53.890
BUILDER HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS --

02:48:53.957 --> 02:48:55.124
TO DOING A ROACH IN CONTROL AND

02:48:55.191 --> 02:48:56.893
SELL STABILIZATION AFTER THE

02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:59.829
FIRE AREA TO DOING -- PROJECTS

02:48:59.896 --> 02:49:02.398
TO REDUCE WALL FIRE RISK -- MANY

02:49:02.465 --> 02:49:03.433
OF THE SAME AREAS THAT WERE

02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:04.667
AROUND THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:06.903
IDENTIFIED BY CAL FIRE -- IN A

02:49:06.970 --> 02:49:08.938
NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS THAT --

02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:11.374
INCLUDED -- OTHER KINDS OF

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:13.676
THREATS AS WELL BEYOND ALL WHILE

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:14.878
FIRE.

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:16.212
HAZARD MITIGATION IS A KEY.

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:19.249
AREA THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING AND

02:49:19.315 --> 02:49:20.884
WE WANT TO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:49:20.950 --> 02:49:24.554
LEVERAGE MORE -- IN ADDITION.

02:49:24.621 --> 02:49:26.723
ALL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING A LOT

02:49:26.789 --> 02:49:29.926
WITH UTILITIES -- THE IOUS IN

02:49:29.993 --> 02:49:32.829
THE RECENT MONTHS -- TO GET THEM

02:49:32.896 --> 02:49:35.698
TO FOCUS ON A COLLABORATIVE

02:49:35.765 --> 02:49:39.102
EFFORT -- OF PREPAREDNESS AND

02:49:39.168 --> 02:49:41.804
PLANNING -- THAT INCLUDES A MUCH

02:49:41.871 --> 02:49:44.207
MORE AGGRESSIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:45.742
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

02:49:45.808 --> 02:49:49.279
AND AND DOING PUBLIC EDUCATION --

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:50.780
WITH WITH THAT WITH THEIR

02:49:50.847 --> 02:49:52.181
CUSTOMERS AND WITH.

02:49:52.248 --> 02:49:54.183
PEOPLE IN GENERAL IN CALIFORNIA --

02:49:54.250 --> 02:49:56.085
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:57.720
CHALLENGES THEY FACE BUT THE

02:49:57.787 --> 02:49:59.055
OUGHT TO ALSO SHARE.

02:49:59.122 --> 02:50:01.658
THIS CONCEPT OF PUBLIC SAFETY

02:50:01.724 --> 02:50:03.026
POWER SHOT OFFICE.

02:50:03.092 --> 02:50:05.094
IT IS NOT IS EXPECTED THAT THIS

02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:11.901
SUMMER -- IN THE HEIGHT OF OUR

02:50:11.968 --> 02:50:14.370
SUMMER SEASON THE HEIGHT A

02:50:14.437 --> 02:50:15.338
WILDFIRE THAT THE THE UTILITIES

02:50:15.405 --> 02:50:16.472
COULD POTENTIALLY SHUT OFF THE

02:50:16.539 --> 02:50:17.240
POWER MULTIPLE TIMES -- AND

02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:19.509
THEY'RE LOOKING AT SIMILAR KINDS

02:50:19.576 --> 02:50:20.543
OF THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:50:20.610 --> 02:50:21.578
IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING

02:50:21.644 --> 02:50:22.879
AT THE SAME THING WE'RE LOOKING

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.781
AT WHEN WE DO OUR PRE

02:50:24.847 --> 02:50:25.748
POSITIONING.

02:50:25.815 --> 02:50:28.284
IS A COORDINATED EFFORT RIGHT SO --

02:50:28.351 --> 02:50:29.552
WE'VE BEEN WORKING --

THE STEPS THAT THEY TAKE OUT IN

02:50:44.867 --> 02:50:46.502
THE ANALYSIS THEY MAKE ON THE

SCIENCE SIDE -- THAT'S

02:50:47.837 --> 02:50:49.772
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE ARE

ON DOING HARDENING OF SOME OF

02:55:06.863 --> 02:55:09.866
THEIR FACILITIES -- I THINK -- I

02:55:09.932 --> 02:55:12.034
COULDN'T TELL YOU THE SPEED OR

02:55:12.101 --> 02:55:14.036

02:55:25.781 --> 02:55:26.582
CENTER.

02:55:26.649 --> 02:55:27.717

CELLULAR ON WHEELS AND OTHER

02:55:36.058 --> 02:55:41.364
KINDS OF MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS --

02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:42.265
BUT IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS AND

02:55:42.331 --> 02:55:45.701
UP I THINK MOVING FORWARD -- BUT

02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:47.270
PART OF MY RESPONSIBILITY AYE

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:48.404

TO REALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF

02:55:56.679 --> 02:55:58.047
THEM SOME OF THESE ON GOING

02:55:58.114 --> 02:56:00.016

AND AND AND AND YOU KNOW.

02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:05.521
I'D I THINK IN SOME CASES OTHERS

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:06.188
WERE TALKING PAST EACH OTHER AND

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:06.889
THAT REALLY IS GOING TO BE

02:56:06.956 --> 02:56:09.558
NECESSARY TO GET EVERYBODY ON

02:56:09.625 --> 02:56:10.159
THE SAME PAGE AND WE'VE DONE

02:56:10.226 --> 02:56:11.360
THAT WITH OTHER.

02:56:11.427 --> 02:56:12.395
OTHER UTILITIES VERY

02:56:12.461 --> 02:56:14.664
SUCCESSFULLY -- BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:16.666
A CRITICAL CRITICAL ASSET TO

02:56:16.732 --> 02:56:18.134
THIS OVERALL PICTURE.

02:56:18.200 --> 02:56:19.835
SO WITH THAT IN MIND ENOUGH AND

02:56:19.902 --> 02:56:21.237

02:56:21.304 --> 02:56:22.805
HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MORE BUT

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:26.275
I'LL I'LL STOP THIS -- ONE THE

02:56:26.342 --> 02:56:30.179
UTILITIES WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT

02:56:30.246 --> 02:56:31.681
MORE -- REGULATORY AUTHORITY

02:56:31.747 --> 02:56:33.249
OVER THE TELEVISION IT SEEMS TO

02:56:33.316 --> 02:56:36.285
ME THAT IN THEIR PROCESS ALL IN

02:56:36.352 --> 02:56:37.887
I MENTIONED EARLIER I THINK OF

02:56:37.954 --> 02:56:40.089
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC WHICH

02:56:40.156 --> 02:56:41.657
BROUGHT IN THE STATE OF THE ART.

02:56:41.724 --> 02:56:45.561
EQUIPMENT PEOPLE THEY'VE REALLY.

02:56:45.628 --> 02:56:48.297
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A RESULT OF

02:56:48.364 --> 02:56:50.132
LITIGATION THAT THAT KIND OF

02:56:50.199 --> 02:56:52.902
HELD THEM. TO TO PAY FOR THE

02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:54.971
LACK OF THIS KIND OF CONCERN

02:56:55.037 --> 02:56:56.205
MANY YEARS AGO BUT THEY HAVE

02:56:56.272 --> 02:56:57.340
STEPPED UP.

02:56:57.406 --> 02:57:00.042
AND THEY HAVE STATE OF THE ART

02:57:00.109 --> 02:57:02.345
EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE -- WEATHER

02:57:02.411 --> 02:57:04.380
SYSTEMS IN EVERY HILL SIDE THAT

02:57:04.447 --> 02:57:07.216
THAT IS IN A HIGH RISK AREA.

02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:09.385
AND I'M WONDERING IF NOW

02:57:09.452 --> 02:57:11.387
ASSUMING THAT THE OTHER

02:57:11.454 --> 02:57:13.022
UTILITIES PARTICULARLY P.

02:57:13.089 --> 02:57:14.857

02:57:14.924 --> 02:57:16.959
THAT THEY DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

02:57:17.026 --> 02:57:18.494
ROLE IN ALL THIS THEY'RE DOING

02:57:18.561 --> 02:57:19.462
THAT KIND OF WORK.

02:57:19.528 --> 02:57:22.064
IS THERE SOME WAY TO WE NEED TO

02:57:22.131 --> 02:57:23.232
DO LEGISLATION.

02:57:23.299 --> 02:57:25.067

WE DON'T REPLICATE ARE

02:57:29.972 --> 02:57:32.675
UNNECESSARILY -- DUPLICATE I

02:57:32.742 --> 02:57:34.110
SHOULD SAY.

02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:35.478
A LOT OF THAT TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:57:35.544 --> 02:57:37.213
THEY'RE BRINGING TO THE TABLE IS

02:57:37.279 --> 02:57:39.315
THERE IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN

02:57:39.382 --> 02:57:43.085
DO OR SHOULD BE DOING OR OR NOT

02:57:43.152 --> 02:57:43.419

I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER BUT

02:57:45.721 --> 02:57:47.556
HERE'S ALL THIS NEW EQUIPMENT

02:57:47.623 --> 02:57:48.891
THE HOT THE BEST AND THE MOST

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

02:57:50.926 --> 02:57:52.361
COMING ONLINE.

02:57:52.428 --> 02:57:54.497
VIA THE UTILITY COMPANIES IS

02:57:54.563 --> 02:57:56.432
THERE SOME WAY WE CAN GET THEM --

02:57:56.499 --> 02:57:58.334
INCORPORATED IN COLLABORATING

02:57:58.401 --> 02:58:00.603

02:58:17.253 --> 02:58:18.387
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A

02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:19.588
EARTHQUAKE IN THIS STATE AND

02:58:19.655 --> 02:58:22.358
JUST INEVITABLE AND AND WHAT CAN

WE DO TO GET.

02:58:23.759 --> 02:58:25.494
THE KIND OF ADVANCED SYSTEMS

02:58:25.561 --> 02:58:27.363
THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED SHOULD

02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:29.231
BE DEVELOPED AS PART OF THE

I MEAN YOU KNOW I THINK

02:58:38.841 --> 02:58:40.843
IMMIGRATION OF ALL THESE ALL

02:58:40.910 --> 02:58:43.045
THESE EFFORTS IS I MEAN WE WORK

02:58:43.112 --> 02:58:44.647
WITH UTILITIES.

02:58:44.713 --> 02:58:46.582

02:59:05.968 --> 02:59:07.636
THE CENTER IS NOT YET A 100%

02:59:07.703 --> 02:59:09.672

02:59:20.883 --> 02:59:23.619
SIDES OF THAT -- YOU KNOW HOW

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:24.653
THEY'RE CAPABLE HOW THE JOINT

02:59:24.720 --> 02:59:26.388
CAPABILITY WORKS AND THEN HOW WE

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:27.490
CAN BRING IT.

02:59:27.556 --> 02:59:29.658
