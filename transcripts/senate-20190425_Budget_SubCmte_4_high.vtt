WEAKNESSES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

FIFTY THOUSAND CHECKS EVERY YEAR.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.327
PHYSICAL PAPER CHECKS AND THAT'S

WE HAVE NO INTERNAL AUTOMATION

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.567
WHICH MEANS THAT WE JUST HAVE A

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:36.402
WHOLE BUNCH OF INEFFICIENCIES.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.404

BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE OFFICE

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:50.683
TO ANOTHER AROUND THE STATE --

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.652
WHEN WHEN ONE OF OUR LICENSEES

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.221

PART OF THE RECORD -- WE DON'T

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.363

THE OFFICE AND LOOK IT UP BATES.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.477
SO JUST MANY THINGS THAT WE

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:18.611
EXPECT IN A MODERN

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:20.346
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY LAW

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.180

IN TERMS OF OUR LICENSING WE WE

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.322
HAVE NO LICENSING DIVISION -- WE

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:30.757
STARTED BIFURCATING THE

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.258
DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE SEPARATED

00:06:32.325 --> 00:06:33.760
THE FUNCTIONS OF KEYS OFFICERS

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:35.361
IN LICENSING PROFESSIONALS ABOUT

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:36.529
TWENTY YEARS AGO.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:38.464
BUT WE REALLY NEVER GOT TO THE

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.999
POINT REBUILT THE STRUCTURE SO

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.834
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SYSTEMATIC

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.703
APPROACH FOR TRAINING OF OUR

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.772
PEOPLE IN THE SUBSTANTIVE AREAS

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.608
IN WHICH THEY WORK -- FOR FOR

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:49.475
PRODUCING POLICIES AND

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:50.643
GUIDELINES TO HELP THEM IN THEIR

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.511
WORK.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:53.212
AND REALLY NOTHING TO ENSURE A

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.680
STATE LIKE CONSISTENCY OTHER

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:56.682

WILL OF OUR EMPLOYEES.

00:06:58.151 --> 00:06:59.786
WHICH IS PRETTY FABULOUS BUT

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:02.155
IT'S REALLY NOT THE WAY TO BUILD

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:04.323
AN ORGANIZATION AND MAINTAIN IT.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.793
ON THE ENFORCEMENT SIDE -- WE WE

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.494

WE HAVE AGAIN THE SAME THE

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:11.264
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME NUMBER OF

WE DON'T DO ENOUGH MINOR DECOY

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.633
ACTIONS WHICH ARE REALLY A

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.070
PRIMARY FOCUS TO ENSURE THEIR

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.188
BASIS TO BE ABLE.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.823
TO DO THE THINGS ARE REQUIRED

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.192
UNDER THAT STATUTE -- IT'S ALSO

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.927
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US THOUGH AS

THE PROPOSAL.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.348
IS IS THE IS THE DEAL WITH OUR

00:08:35.414 --> 00:08:36.649
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT -- WE ARE

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.783

EVEN SLOWLY.

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:45.358
BENDING THAT DOWN AND TORE NOW

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:47.927

OUR SERVICES THEY ARE TODAY.

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:53.900
WE NEED ABOUT A 15% INCREASE.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.235

HUNDRED AND FIVE DOLLAR

00:09:47.553 --> 00:09:48.788

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:51.791
IF WE JUST DO NOTHING OTHER THAN

THEY WOULD PAY SIX HUNDRED

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:04.704
EIGHTY DOLLARS BETTER FOR ABLE

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.205
TO MODERNIZE THEY WOULD PAY AN

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:07.707
ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:09.709

BEER AND WINE RESTAURANT.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:22.388
WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.723

ACTUALLY MODERNIZE THE

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.397
DEPARTMENT AND THE WAY THAT OUR

HAVE GENERAL COMMENTS AND THEN A

00:10:56.055 --> 00:10:56.622
I THINK CLEARLY THE DEPARTMENT

00:10:56.689 --> 00:10:57.623
HAS HAD SOME CHALLENGES IN THE

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:58.924

MENTIONED THESE PROPOSALS ARE

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.329
AIMED AT A THING THOSE -- ISSUES

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:05.464
THERE ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE

HAS HAD FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.679
YEARS I'M AND I THINK REGARDLESS

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:23.115
OF WHAT OTHER ACTIONS ARE TAKEN

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:24.583
SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE TO

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:25.317

00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:47.359
THIS PROPOSAL COMBINES THOSE AND

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:48.861
THE REASON WE DID THAT IS

00:13:48.928 --> 00:13:50.262
BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:51.997
SIGNIFICANT FUNCTION FUNCTIONAL

00:13:52.064 --> 00:13:54.934
AND ARCHITECTURAL OVERLAP IN THE

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.702
WAY THE IT SYSTEMS WOULD WORK --

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:58.404
WE THERE'S RESULT IN COST

00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.738
SAVINGS AND THEN ALSO THERE'S

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:04.043

SURE LOST SHORES SO SO WHAT ARE

00:15:39.371 --> 00:15:40.839
THE FEES WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR

00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.841
STAFF MEMBERS WHO WHEN THE LAW

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.276
WAS PASSED.

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.811
WE WERE CAUGHT IN THE SAID HE

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.413
RECEIVED THIS LAST YEAR'S BUDGET --

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:47.913
AND THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.250
DEVELOPING ALL THE REGULATIONS --

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:52.618
AND THE AND THE AND THE

00:15:52.685 --> 00:15:54.620
ESSENTIALLY THE STAFF SUPPORT

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.389
THIS CAN BE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH.

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.290
THE SUBSTANTIVE SIDE OF IT.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:00.192
THIS MONEY IS NOW FOR

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.061
ESSENTIALLY BUILDING THE IT

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.629
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:06.298
ACTUALLY RUN THE PROGRAM.

00:16:06.365 --> 00:16:07.166
I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.701
INDUSTRY TOLD US THEY WANTED

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.302
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS THIS

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:11.804
FOR THIS TO BE AUTOMATED.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.406
SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP TRACK OF

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.642
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SERVERS AND

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:18.310
AUTHORIZED THE SERVERS.

00:16:18.377 --> 00:16:20.512
BECAUSE THE PENALTIES ASSOCIATED

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:21.447
WITH NOT COMPLYING WITH THE LAW

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:23.515
ARE ON THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:26.151
NOT ON THE INDIVIDUAL SERVERS.

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:27.920
SO TO BUILD OUT WE NEEDED TO

00:16:27.986 --> 00:16:29.621
REALLY BUILD AND AND AN

00:16:29.688 --> 00:16:31.824
INTERFACE THAT WOULD ALLOW --

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.892
INTERACTION BETWEEN BUSINESS

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.761
OWNERS BETWEEN THE SERVERS ARE

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:39.965
ACTUALLY BEING CERTIFIED -- THAT

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.134
THE DEPARTMENT WOULD MAINTAIN --

00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:45.337
WE ALSO DETERMINED THAT -- THAT

00:16:45.404 --> 00:16:46.672
WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE A TRAINER

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:48.674
OURSELVES EVEN THOUGH THE STATUE

00:16:48.741 --> 00:16:49.675
AUTHORIZES THAT.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.110
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:53.445
COST EFFECTIVE WE BELIEVE THAT

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:55.948
THE THAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:57.182
ALSO A LOT OF ENTITIES TO

00:16:57.249 --> 00:16:59.618
PROVIDE THIS TRAINING FOR FREE.

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.019
EITHER THROUGH COUNTIES OR

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:02.421
CITIES SOMETIMES EMPLOYERS

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:04.289
THEMSELVES THERE'S MANY INDUSTRY

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:05.724
GROUPS THAT THEY WOULD BE AT

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:07.860
POSITION TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE

00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:09.094
BE THE TRAINERS AS OPPOSED TO US

00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:11.530
BUILDING AT A JUNIOR COLLEGE FOR

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.165
MORE OR LESS OF THE ABC.

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:15.801
SO SO WE WE JUST WE WE ARE NOT

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.236
GONNA BE A TRAINER AND LESS WE

00:17:17.302 --> 00:17:18.871
DISCOVER THAT IT'S NOT AS COST

00:17:18.937 --> 00:17:22.241
EFFECTIVE AS IT APPEARS FOR THE

00:17:22.307 --> 00:17:23.142
SERVERS UP TO TAKE IT.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.511
AND ALSO IF -- THERE'S SOME SOME

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.679
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES IN TERMS

00:17:27.746 --> 00:17:35.821
OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR OR FOR

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.891
ACCESS IF THEY'RE UNABLE TO

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:39.425
ACTUALLY GET THE TRAINING

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.159
THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.427
THEN WE MIGHT BECOME TRAINERS TO

00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:43.729
ACTUALLY GET THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:17:43.796 --> 00:17:46.298
I'M WE WE ALSO DETERMINE THE

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:46.899
WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:47.766
THAT WOULD BE MORE COST

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.901
EFFECTIVE AND GENERALLY TO THEIR

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:50.035
LIKING THAT WE ACTUALLY CONDUCT

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:52.371
THE EXAM OURSELVES.

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:53.872
AND THIS IS BECAUSE FOR THEM TO

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:56.074
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO RUN.

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:59.211
THE SYSTEMS -- AND HAVE A OF OF

00:17:59.278 --> 00:18:01.513
OF OF PROCTORED ALTHOUGH IT'S

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.148
VIRTUALLY PROCTORED EXAM VERY

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:05.350
EXPENSIVE VERY DIFFICULT IN A

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.585
LOT OF JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

00:18:06.652 --> 00:18:08.253
AND THOSE WOULD BE PRIMARILY THE

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.223
INDUSTRY GROUPS AND THE THE

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:14.359
GOVERNMENT.

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.428
GOVERNMENTS TO SOMEONE I

00:18:16.495 --> 00:18:17.329
ACTUALLY PROVIDE THE TRAIN.

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:19.932
SO WE ARE GOING TO WE ARE GOING

00:18:19.998 --> 00:18:21.133
TO BE THE EXAM.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.868
PROVIDER OURSELVES ALTHOUGH MUCH

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:25.370
OF THIS WILL BE DONE THROUGH

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:26.438
OUTSIDE VENDORS LITTLE ONE THAT.

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:27.739
WE WILL BE MONITORING THOSE

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.475
EXAMS JUST TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.376
WITH THE STATUTES AND THE

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:32.511
REQUIREMENTS.

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:36.515
OF THE ROLES OF THE ESTABLISH

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.250
OKAY SO A LITTLE BIT.

00:18:38.317 --> 00:18:42.988
OKAY SO -- IF I AM A SERVER.

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:45.057
ALCOHOL SERVER RIGHT -- I NOW

00:18:45.123 --> 00:18:47.125
HAVE TO HAVE.

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:48.827
DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:18:48.894 --> 00:18:50.128
WHERE I'M AT NOW.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.397
WHAT PART OF ME NOW AND WHAT

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.966
WILL BE REQUIRED OF ME?

00:18:54.032 --> 00:18:57.703
AND HOW DO I DO IT SO I WORKING.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.005
AND THERE'S THESE NEW RULES

00:19:00.072 --> 00:19:02.674
TRAINING OR CERTIFICATION HOW

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:05.010
NEW ARE THERE ARE THERE SOME.

00:19:05.077 --> 00:19:06.545
IS THERE SOME CERTIFICATION

00:19:06.612 --> 00:19:09.715
CURRENTLY REQUIRED WHO DOES IT I

00:19:09.781 --> 00:19:12.184
GUESS I WANNA KNOW.

00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.218
WHERE WE SAY TO ALL THESE

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.920
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.288
BARTENDERS AND?

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:18.991
ALCOHOL SERVERS ALL OVER THE

00:19:19.057 --> 00:19:19.758
PLACE.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:22.160
IN THIS INDUSTRY WHAT DO WE SAY

00:19:22.227 --> 00:19:22.794
TO THEM NOW.

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.198
YES SO PARTLY THAT MESSAGE WILL

00:19:26.265 --> 00:19:28.333
WE WE ANTICIPATE WILL COME OUT

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.701
THROUGH WHATEVER PUBLIC.

00:19:29.768 --> 00:19:31.203
AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS WERE ABLE TO

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.170
DO BUT ALSO THROUGH THE

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.705
EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WILL BE

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:36.008
AWARE OF THIS -- REQUIREMENT

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:38.210
THAT THEY HAVE SERVERS THAT ARE

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:39.144
CERTIFIED.

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:39.945
SO IF I'M A SERVER WHO NEEDS TO

00:19:40.012 --> 00:19:41.480
BE CERTIFIED IF I'M CURRENTLY

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.348
EMPLOYED WE THINK THE MOST

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.617
LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT THE

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:47.386
EMPLOYERS THEMSELVES WILL HAVE

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:49.555
TO PAY FOR THE TIME AND THE FEES

00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:50.956
ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING THAT

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.159
SERVER -- CERTIFIED AS JUST A

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:59.131
MATTER OF LABOR LAW -- BECAUSE

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:00.232
IT'S A REQUIRE IT'S A JOB. FOR

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.834
THOSE WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED --

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:06.171
THEY WILL HAVE -- TO TAKE A

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:09.541
COURSE AND ACHIEVE THE

00:20:09.608 --> 00:20:11.677
CERTIFICATION -- CELL -- THE WAY

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.045
THAT CAN BE DONE IS THROUGH IN

00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:15.414
PERSON TRAINING OR IT CAN BE

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.481
DONE.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.151
THEIR INTERNET TRAINING.

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:19.851
OKAY SO THEY WOULD FIND A A

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:20.485
TRAINER.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:21.420
THEY WOULD SIGN UP THEY WOULD

00:20:21.486 --> 00:20:23.188
TAKE THE COURSE AND THEN ONCE

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.456
THEY COMPLETED THE COURSE

00:20:24.523 --> 00:20:25.624
SATISFACTORILY.

00:20:25.691 --> 00:20:27.659
THEN THEY WOULD BE SENT TO OUR

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.062
WEB PORTAL WHICH ESSENTIALLY

00:20:30.128 --> 00:20:30.629
WOULD ALLOW THEM TO TAKE THE

00:20:30.696 --> 00:20:33.332
EXAM -- OURS THERE ARE CURRENTLY

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:36.234
NO REQUIREMENTS STATEWIDE. FOR

00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:38.837
ANY SERVER TO BE CERTIFIED.

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.306
THERE ARE LOCAL THE HOWEVER

00:20:41.373 --> 00:20:43.542

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.830
OTHER ENTITY TO THE NATIONAL

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:46.431
MEDITATION.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:48.266
SO THERE IS AN AUTHORITY THAT

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:49.601
DOES THE ACCREDITATION AND THEN

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.203
A ARMS THE QUALITY AND THE

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:55.874
DEVICE MEETING THE STANDARDS

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.175
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:27:57.242 --> 00:27:58.476
AND THEN ONE THING ALSO TALK

00:27:58.543 --> 00:28:00.812
ABOUT IT IS THE I. T. IN THE

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:01.713
INTER CONNECTED VIDEO MEAN A

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.548
THERE'S BEEN SO MANY PROBLEMS.

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:04.883
WITH THIS SITE KEY AND AND

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:05.717
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT.

YOU WERE THE LEAST OF CONCERNS

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.120
THAT.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:10.488
DO YOU HAVE GOOD CONFIDENCE THAT

00:28:10.555 --> 00:28:11.756
THE VENDORS AND AND YOUR

YEAH WELL MONITORED AND

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:17.362
FUNCTIONAL AND YES I THINK

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:19.531
THAT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE ARE

00:28:19.597 --> 00:28:20.732
NOT.

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.535
CREATING A A BRAND NEW LARGE

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.703
SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE REALLY MOSTLY

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.105

LICENSING SYSTEM THAT WE ALREADY

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:29.340

00:28:29.407 --> 00:28:32.043
RIGHT SO SO IT'S REALLY AN

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.545
INCREMENTAL.

FOR IN THIS AREA -- BUT IT'S IN

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.710
PERSON AND IT'S REALLY NOT A

00:30:12.777 --> 00:30:14.946
COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR MOST

PROGRAM BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:22.687
ACTUALLY ON LIQUOR STORES --

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:24.422
CHANGE THE FOCUS BECAUSE RIGHT

NOW SORT OF ALL SERVICE.

00:30:25.823 --> 00:30:27.525
WHERE IS THERE'S THIS TRAIN

00:30:27.592 --> 00:30:29.194
DOESN'T REQUIRE LIQUOR STORES TO

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:31.029
BE TRANSFER OF WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:30:31.095 --> 00:30:32.197
REALLY MORE FOCUS ON THE

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:34.265
CHALLENGES OF THAT OUR TRAFFIC

00:30:34.332 --> 00:30:34.465
READ?

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:38.636
IT'S A BIT ALL BE A BETTER USE

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:40.038
OF OUR TIME AND MONEY.

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:42.907
OKAY MAYBE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

00:30:42.974 --> 00:30:43.775
IT ALSO OFFER.

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:46.044
OF THESE COURSES THAT IS THAT IS

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.511
POSSIBLE YEAH.

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:50.848
OKAY GREAT -- AND THE FEES --

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:52.517
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE

00:30:52.584 --> 00:30:54.719
SERVERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY.

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:57.555
IS THERE -- SPECIFIC I DON'T

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.592
KNOW THAT THERE'S A A SPECIFIC.

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.594
CAP ON THE AMOUNT OVER A CERTAIN

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.295
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.030
I DO WE HANDLE THAT.

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:09.400
THIRD THERE'S NOT A SPECIFIC.

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.569
MENTION OUR PROPOSAL -- THERE

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:13.805
THERE'S THE BILL ITSELF HAD

00:31:13.871 --> 00:31:14.672
LANGUAGE THAT ESSENTIALLY

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:16.874
LIMITED AS TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS

00:31:16.941 --> 00:31:17.909
FOR BUT THAT WAS REALLY IF WE

00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:19.978
ARE GOING TO BE SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:21.379
A TRAINING COURSE WE PERFORM BE

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:22.347
PROVIDING.

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.282
I'M RIGHT NOW OUR BEST ESTIMATE

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:27.185
IS THAT THE THE COST OF THE EXAM

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:28.820
OUR COSTS THE EXAM IS AROUND

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.488
THREE DOLLARS -- BUT I KNOW

00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:33.925
THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF A CAP --

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.860
WHICH OBVIOUSLY ROLLING OUT A

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:39.797
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT MAKE

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:42.066
SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:43.101
I WOULD URGE SOME VERSION OF A

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:45.903
CAPSULE THAT.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.338
WE CAN SAY HOW LONG AGO OKAY

00:31:47.405 --> 00:31:49.107
YEAH I'D DIE AND I WOULD ONLY

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.608
POINT OUT THAT THE ARE --

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:52.176
PROPOSAL DOES LIMIT BECAUSE IT

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:52.910
SAYS IT'S THE FEES MAY BE

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.545
CHARGED NECESSARY TO COVER

00:31:54.612 --> 00:31:55.380
REASONABLE COST FOR

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:56.547
ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM

00:31:56.614 --> 00:31:58.182
AUTHORIZED BY THIS ARTICLE SO

00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:59.751
WHILE IT'S NOT SPECIFIED DOLLAR

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:00.885
AMOUNT.

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.420
IT WOULDN'T BE SOME KIND OF

00:32:02.487 --> 00:32:04.389
LARGE AMOUNTS TO SORT OF FIND

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:05.757
OTHER ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE

00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:06.557
DEPARTMENT SO IT'S SORT OF

00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:08.426
LIMITED ONLY TO THE SCOPE OF

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:09.861
THIS EXISTING PROGRAM.

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.396
SO IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC DOLLAR

00:32:11.462 --> 00:32:14.766
AMOUNT IT'S IT IS RESTRICTED TO

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:16.901
THE PROGRAM COST.

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:19.270
OKAY ANYTHING ELSE THE FINANCE

00:32:19.337 --> 00:32:23.941
WANTS.

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.576
TO I JUST A COUPLE QUICK

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:26.978
COMMENTS AND WHEN MY

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.379

PLANNING PROCESS AND IT'S

00:32:33.351 --> 00:32:33.851
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:35.119
RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE

00:32:35.186 --> 00:32:38.222
ACROSS -- GOVERNMENT -- SO

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.590
ESSENTIALLY THIS PROJECT IS

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:40.692
MIDWAY THROUGH THE PROJECT

00:32:40.758 --> 00:32:42.393
APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS WHICH

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.028
IS THIS NEW PROCESS IMPLEMENTED

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:46.497
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO -- FOR

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.999
PLANNING AND UNDERTAKING I. T.

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:48.700
PROJECT.

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.535
AND AND SO BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.370
MIDWAY THROUGH ITS ITS COMPLETED

00:32:52.437 --> 00:32:54.105
I THINK STAGE TO YOU OF THAT A

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:55.840
MULTI STAGE PROCESS THE

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:57.475
LEGISLATURE DOESN'T YET HAVE I

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.976
TOTALLY COMPLETE AND FULL

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.012
PICTURE OF WHAT THE COST OF THIS

00:33:01.079 --> 00:33:03.648
PROJECT WILL LIKELY BE -- AS THE

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:04.649
DEPARTMENT.

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:05.917
TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PROCESS

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:07.452
AND RECEIVE SOLICITATIONS FOR

00:33:07.518 --> 00:33:09.821
EXAMPLE -- IT'LL HAVE A MORE

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:11.789
REFINED ESTIMATE AS TO WORK

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:12.323
MEETINGS AND BUDGET BILL

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:12.890
LANGUAGE AS I SAID WHICH IS

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.125
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE'VE

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.960
RECOMMENDED IN OTHER AREAS.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:17.328
AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE FUNDING

00:33:17.395 --> 00:33:19.964
CONTINGENT ON AND I NOTICE TO

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:21.699
THE LEGISLATURE -- REGARDING

00:33:21.766 --> 00:33:23.768
THIRD COMPLETING THAT PROCESS

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:24.669
AND AND WHAT THE ULTIMATE COSTS

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.003
ARE SO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE WE

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.838
THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:27.538
OVERSIGHT.

00:33:27.605 --> 00:33:29.507
ON IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA AND

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:30.942
AND GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WE'VE

00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:32.877
HAD A NINETY PROJECT THAT'S VERY

00:33:32.944 --> 00:33:33.244
HELPFUL.

00:33:33.311 --> 00:33:33.978
AND THE SECOND THIN I JUST

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:36.581
WANTED TO NOTE IS -- AS WAS

00:33:36.647 --> 00:33:37.615
MENTIONED I THINK MULTIPLE TIMES

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:39.117
THIS PROJECT REALLY HAS TWO

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:41.386
COMPONENTS THERE'S THE ESERVICES

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:42.520
COMPONENT AND THERE'S

00:33:42.587 --> 00:33:43.688
RESPONSIBLE BEVERAGE COMPONENT --

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.056
WITH REGARD TO THE RESPONSIBLE

00:33:45.123 --> 00:33:49.227
BEVERAGE COMPONENT -- THIS IS IS --

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:51.863
THIS IN TOTAL THIS PIECE WILL --

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:53.398
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADD TO THE

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.565
TOTAL COST OF IMPLEMENTING THAT

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:56.501
PROJECT SO THAT PRIDE BASICALLY

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.569
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THESE FOLKS

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.338
UNDERGO THAT TRAINING -- WAS

00:34:00.405 --> 00:34:01.939
PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:03.775
WHEN THAT HAPPENS THAT ESTIMATE

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:05.510
ACOSTA SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER SO

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:05.977
THAT'S JUST AN IN THE

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:06.577
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO WE

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.713
WANT TO FLAG FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:17.288
JUST. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:17.889
DOES SOMETHING THAT BOOKS ARE

00:34:17.955 --> 00:34:19.257
COMFORTABLE WITH [inaudible]

00:34:19.323 --> 00:34:22.059
YES.

00:34:22.126 --> 00:34:22.660
REALLY MANNING DEPARTMENT OF

00:34:22.727 --> 00:34:24.495
FINANCE -- SO THE DEPARTMENT OF

PROCESS IS THAT PROJECTS DO

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:39.911
THEIR DILLON.

00:34:39.977 --> 00:34:41.779

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:43.080
THE BILL WOULD BE CPI INCREASE

00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:44.782
BREAST IN THE FUTURE CORRECT.

DON'T WANT TO SEE YOUTH DRINKING

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.291
BUT AT THE SAME TIME EVERY TIME

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.226
A YOUTH IS INVOLVED IN AN

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:50.728

COULD DECLINE IN THE COMING

00:51:58.448 --> 00:51:59.649
YEARS IF THE STATE FACES A

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.851
RECESSION AND WHILE SCHOOL

PRESSURES IN THE FUTURE.

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:07.791

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:08.825
ASIDE SOME FUNDING FOR RATE

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:09.993

DISTRICTS ARE PRESSED REQUEST

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.886
FOR RELIEF NOW -- I WOULD ALSO

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:38.154
NOTE THAT OF THE FURTHER OUT WE

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.590
DELAY THESE PAYMENTS THE LESS OF

00:52:40.657 --> 00:52:41.725
AN EFFECT THAT WILL BE MAKE WILL

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:43.927
BE MAKING ON IT BECAUSE IT'S

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:46.563

BASICALLY PAYROLL AND I HEAR ALL

00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.200
GROWS THE BE LESS OF AN EFFECT --

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:51.167
BUT SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BE

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:55.739
DEDICATED ON BEHALF OF THE

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:57.874
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:52:57.941 --> 00:52:58.475
I DO THOUGH THINK THOUGH THERE

00:52:58.542 --> 00:52:58.875
IS.

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:01.778
THAT ISSUE OF AS EXPECTED

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.180
THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS FUNDING.

00:53:04.247 --> 00:53:05.582
BY -- SOMEWHERE SOMEHOW

00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:08.018
EVERYBODY SAYING -- THE

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.653
ECONOMY'S GONNA.

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.354
SLOW DOWN OR WE JUST GONNA HAVE

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.389
LESS FUNDING AND THEN IT'S

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:13.924
REALLY GOOD TO BE A BIGGER

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.791
CRISIS.

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.893
WITH THE DISTRICTS SO QUESTION

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.128

00:53:18.194 --> 00:53:20.030
GOVERNOR'S VISION OF LOOKING

AHEAD HOW DO YOU PREPARE -- I DO

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:26.069
THINK THERE IS A A VERY VERY

00:53:26.136 --> 00:53:29.005
STRONG ARGUMENT TO BE MADE ABOUT.

00:53:29.072 --> 00:53:31.341
HOLDING HOLDING OFF ON GIVING

00:53:31.408 --> 00:53:32.842

IN ORDER TO GIVE IT SET IT ASIDE

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:36.846
AND GIVE IT WHEN IT'S MORE.

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:39.916
I THINK MORE DRAMATICALLY NEEDED --

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.651
SO I THINK THERE'S A REALLY

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:42.852
LEGITIMATE POINT TO BE MADE.

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:45.388

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:05.935
WE'RE AT LEAST DRESSING IN SOME

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:07.303
PART.

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.505
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPLAIN -- ALEJO

00:55:08.571 --> 00:55:10.807
HOW IT IS THAT THERE'S A 20%

00:55:10.874 --> 00:55:11.474
CHANCE THAT THERE'S NOT GOING TO

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:12.609
BE ANY SAVINGS AND IN QUITE

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:14.344
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:15.645
WELL I WILL -- I'LL DEFER TO CAL

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:16.680
STARS -- FOR A MORE DETAILED

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.214
EXPLANATION -- BUT IT'S NOT A

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.983
20% CHANCE OF NO SAVINGS AT ALL

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.154
220% CHANCE OF NO SAVINGS BEFORE --

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.288
TWENTY FORTY SIX AND THAT THERE

00:55:25.355 --> 00:55:26.923
WOULD BE SAVINGS AFTER THAT

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:28.925
POINT BUT OF COURSE THAT'S IN A

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:31.027
FEW DECADES FROM NOW SO LET ME

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:32.996
ALL DIFFERENT TO JUST ALL OF

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.564
TRIED TO GIVE YOU A A SHORT THEN

00:55:34.631 --> 00:55:35.899
THE BRIEF EXPLANATION BUT WHEN

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:39.369
YOU LOOK AT WHEN YOU TRY TO FUND.

00:55:39.436 --> 00:55:40.970
A PENSION FUND.

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:41.604
A PENSION PLAN ONE OF THE KEY

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.673
ELEMENT IS AND YOU OFTEN HEAR

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.408
ABOUT IT THIS YOU HEAR ABOUT

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:47.877
CALPERS AND CAL STIRS EXPECT

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.847
EARNS 7% LONG TERM. ONE OF THE

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:52.382
SO WHEN WE FUN.

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:53.616
AS YOU KNOW YOU PROBABLY ALL

00:55:53.683 --> 00:55:55.652
HAVE MONEY INVESTED IN FOR ONE

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:56.152
CASE.

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:57.387
HAS BEEN MARKETS THE INVESTMENT

00:55:57.454 --> 00:55:59.689
RETURNS ON NOT ALWAYS 7%.

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:01.324
IN FACT I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER

00:56:01.391 --> 00:56:03.626
OWN SEVEN WE ARE IN MORE OR LESS

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:05.462
AND WHAT WE NORMALLY DO AS PART

00:56:05.528 --> 00:56:06.963
OF THE FUNDING IS.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.399
IF LET'S SAY YOU EARN LESS THAN.

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.468
SEVEN YOU DID NOT MEET YOUR

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.802
EXPECTATIONS.

00:56:12.869 --> 00:56:16.706
IF YOU WANT TO STAY ON TRACK

00:56:16.773 --> 00:56:18.074
WITH YOUR FUNDING.

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.609
DO YOU NEED TO HAVE A MECHANISM

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:20.543
TO MAKE UP THAT SHORTFALL IF YOU

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.011
WANTED TO MECHANISM WE NOW HAVE

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:22.979
A CAL STIRS.

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.247
THROUGH THE COST WAS FUNDING

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:26.683
PLAN IS WE ARE ABLE TO ADJUST

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.651
CONTRIBUTION RATES AND IN THESE

00:56:28.718 --> 00:56:30.386
CASES WE WOULD MEAN WE WOULD

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:31.755
NORMALLY ASK THE STATE. TO

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.089
CONTRIBUTE MORE TO MAKE UP THE

00:56:33.156 --> 00:56:35.024
DIFFERENCE AS PART OF A FUNDING

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.226
PLAN.

00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:40.063
THERE WERE SOME -- SOME RULES

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:41.197
WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR OUR

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:42.766
BOARD CAN ONLY INCREASED THE

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:45.068
STATE CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF

00:56:45.135 --> 00:56:46.069
A PERCENT PER YEAR.

00:56:46.136 --> 00:56:47.237
OF IT HAS SOME ADVANTAGES

00:56:47.303 --> 00:56:48.972
BECAUSE IT PROVIDES MORE BUDGET

00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:50.807
STABILITY TO THE STATE ONE OF

00:56:50.874 --> 00:56:52.142
THE DISADVANTAGES IF THERE IS A

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:54.644
NEED TO INCREASE THE RATE BY 2%.

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.079
IT WILL TAKE US FOR YEARS BEFORE

00:56:56.146 --> 00:56:57.580
WE DO IT.

00:56:57.647 --> 00:56:59.015
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS THERE

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:01.050
COULD BE A SITUATION IF WE WERE

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:02.085
TO GO WITH WERE LOW PERIOD OF

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:03.520
INVESTMENT RETURNS WHERE.

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:06.156
THE MONEY GIVEN BY THE STATE WE

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:07.624
MAY NOT BE ABLE.

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.959
TO ACTUALLY A PROVIDER RATE

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:11.194
RELIEF TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.630
THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR MAYBE

00:57:13.696 --> 00:57:15.131
LET'S SEE TEN OR TWENTY YEARS.

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.299
IT'S ALSO THAT THE REASON WHY

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:19.202
DOT THIS 20% PROBABILITY WAS

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.337
DERIVED FROM A MODEL THAT WE

00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:22.972
HAVE A CAL STIRS THAT SIMULATES

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.041
POTENTIAL FUTURE OF THE

00:57:25.108 --> 00:57:26.709
INVESTMENT A WORLD.

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:28.645
SO THERE IS A LET'S SAY LIKE

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.013
SOMETIME WE OFTEN TELL OUR BOARD

00:57:30.079 --> 00:57:33.216
THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY 25% CHANCE

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.384
THAT WE MAY ARMED EIGHT FIVE

00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:36.085
POINT 5% FOR THE NEXT THIRTY

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:36.953
YEARS.

00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:38.254
SAID THIS SCENARIO WHERE TO

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:39.522
MATERIALIZE.

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:41.057
IT WOULD LEAD TO A SITUATION

00:57:41.124 --> 00:57:42.258
WHERE OUR BOARD WOULD BE

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:44.727
REQUIRED A WOULD BE ASKED TO

00:57:44.794 --> 00:57:46.196
INCREASE THE STATE CONTRIBUTION

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.730
RATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.132
NEXT THIRTY YEARS.

00:57:49.199 --> 00:57:50.800
AND THIS ADDITIONAL CON THESE

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:53.169
ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD NEVER.

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:56.039
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.207
SAVINGS TO THE STATE THEY WOULD

00:57:57.273 --> 00:57:59.209
ALWAYS MATERIALS IN SAVINGS OVER

00:57:59.275 --> 00:58:01.177
TIME BUT FOR THIS ANALYSIS.

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:02.645
SAVINGS WERE MEASURED THROUGHOUT

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:03.847
THE LIFE MCALISTER'S FUNDING

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:06.282
PLAN WHICH IS TWO THOUSAND AND

00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.816
FORTY SIX SO IT'S SORT OF

00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:08.885
DIRECTLY RELATED TO INVESTMENT

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:16.559
PERFORMANCE OF THE COUNSELORS

00:58:16.626 --> 00:58:20.129
FUNDS OF IT'S IT'S A IT'S A VERY.

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.364
SIMPLE MIND THE ACT THE VARIABLE

00:58:21.431 --> 00:58:22.298
IS THE RATE OF RETURN CORRECT

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:22.799
YOU IF YOU DON'T HIT THE

00:58:22.866 --> 00:58:23.499
EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN.

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.468
THEN YOU YOU WON'T HIT YOUR

00:58:25.535 --> 00:58:26.102
EXPECTATIONS OBVIOUSLY AND THAT

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:27.003
THERE'S A 20% CHANCE THAT YOU

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.806
WON'T HIT THAT BEFORE TWENTY

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:30.206
FORTY SIX IS THAT.

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:30.940
ACCURATE.

00:58:31.007 --> 00:58:32.775
NO I THINK IT'S MORE THERE'S A

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:34.344
20% CHANCE THAT DIFFER RETURNS A

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:37.413
LOW ENOUGH IT MAY NOT ALLOW THE

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.581
STATE TO VISIT TO TO THE PENNY

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:39.749
SAME SO IT WILL HAVE TO BE MORE

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:41.384
LIKE YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:47.023
THE 5% RANGE THEN IT WOULD.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.491
NOT ALLOWED TO STATE TO READ TO

00:58:48.558 --> 00:58:49.525
TO BASICALLY YEAH.

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.094
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED FUNDING

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:52.161
PLAN WE HAVE SO THE TO CREATE

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:54.597
SOME [inaudible]

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:58.868

I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

ARE FUNDED I TYPICALLY -- IT'S

00:59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.496
ESTIMATED THAT THESE -- THIS

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.331
PAYMENT WILL RESULT IN A SAVINGS

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:02.699
OF SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION

01:00:02.765 --> 01:00:03.599
DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:04.467
DECADES.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.535
I'M WHICH WILL BRING DOWN THE

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:06.135
CONTRIBUTION RIGHT TO PROVIDE

01:00:06.202 --> 01:00:08.571
SOME RELIEF TO STATE DEPARTMENT --

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:15.611
FOR BIRD PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.381
OF I ALSO WANTED.

TO RESPOND TO SOME COMMON ALSO

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.317
MADE AND AND THE AGENDA.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:25.088
OF THEIR THERE WAS A DISCUSSION

01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:26.923
ABOUT -- SORT OF THE EQUITY OF

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.790
THE GENERAL FUND IS SUPPOSED TO

01:00:28.024 --> 01:00:29.959
MAKE THE PAYMENT BUT WOULDN'T BE

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:31.327
SAVINGS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:31.861
OTHER FUNDS THAT.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.329
THE PAY INTO THESE FIVE STATE

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.998
PLANS -- WHAT WE TRIED TO DO

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.265
WITH A PROPOSAL SO SORT OF

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:38.534
RECONCILE -- MAKING SURE THAT

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:39.902
THE JONATHAN DOES RECEIVE SOME

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:40.870
OF THE BENEFIT THAT IT PERTAINS

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.605
BUT ALSO NOT PROVIDING OR NOT I

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.940
HAVE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:46.576
ON OTHER FUNDS -- RELATED TO THE

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:48.978
PROPOSAL -- STIFFER REFERENCE A

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:49.712
DEFECT IN THE AGENDA ITEM WE DID --

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.881
PREVIOUSLY MAKE A SIX BILLION

01:00:51.948 --> 01:00:53.049
DOLLAR OF THE MODEL PENSION

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:55.785
PAYMENT TO CALPERS I'M IN.

01:00:55.852 --> 01:00:56.386
TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I'M

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:57.687
THIS PYMENT WAS MADE THROUGH A

01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:59.122
LOAN THAT WAS TAKEN OUT FROMTHE

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:00.423
SURPLUS MONEY INVESTMENT FUND

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.658
WHICH HOUSES -- EXCESS CASH

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:07.230
RESERVES OF FOR ALL STATE

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:10.433
DEPARTMENT OR STATE FUNDS -- SO

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.901
SO THIS AT THE WAY THAT WE

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.469
STRUCTURED THE SIX BILLION

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:14.737
DOLLAR PAYMENT A COUPLE YOUR

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:15.638
LETTER LAST YEAR -- IT WAS TO BE

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.740
DEDICATED TOWARDS THAT THE COST

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:18.708
OF A DECISION THAT WAS MADE BY

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.076
THE CALPERS BOARD A COUPLE OF

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.611
YEARS AGO TO REDUCE THEIR SOON

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.579
RATED IT MUST RETURN -- BY

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.114
REDUCING THAT SEEM GREAT RETURN

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.983
THERE'S A GAP NOW OF OF FUNDING

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.618
THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO THE TO

01:01:28.684 --> 01:01:30.620
AT PENSIONS WHICH AND HAS TO BE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.321
FILLED BY EMPLOYERS SUCH AS THE

01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:34.957
ALL WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S --

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:36.793
SO THE WAY THAT THE INDUSTRY

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.861
CAME IT WAS STRUCTURED.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:40.696
IT ALLOWED AND IT RESULTED IN

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:41.931
SAVINGS THAT BANDS THAT WERE

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.800
LARGER OVER A SHORT PERIOD TIME

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:44.734
FOR WHICH THE TIME THAT ALL

01:01:44.801 --> 01:01:49.338
FUNDS WERE EXPECTED TO REPAY THE

01:01:49.405 --> 01:01:50.773
LOAN THAT FUNDED IT --

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.109
ALTERNATIVELY -- THIS PROPOSED

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:54.911
PAYMENT IT'S IT'S BEING PAID TO

01:01:54.977 --> 01:01:55.545
PROVIDE DOLLARS IS BEING PAID

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:56.813
OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME SO

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.181
WILL BE MORE IN SAVINGS BUT YOU

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.982
WON'T SEE AS MANY SAVINGS OR

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:00.616
BOARD SORT OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:01.784
WHICH IS -- OVER THE TIME PERIOD

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:03.553
THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY AFFECTS

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:05.054
WITH ALONE -- SO JUST WANT TO

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:06.456
NOTE THAT WE ARE DECISION TO NOT

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:07.824
INTRODUCE ALONE COMPONENT TO

01:02:07.890 --> 01:02:09.392
HAVE OTHER FUNDS REPAY FOR THEIR

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.393
SHARE THE BENEFIT THAT THE

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.763
GENERAL FUND IS MAKING -- IS

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:14.797
BECAUSE WE SEE A TO A PORTION

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:16.365
AND PROPORTIONATELY LOWER

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.400
BENEFIT OVER THIS HYPOTHETICAL

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.435
LOAN REPAYMENT TERM THAT WOULD

01:02:19.502 --> 01:02:23.639
PROVIDE LEAP RELIEF TO THEM AS

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:26.709
THE REPAYING THE LOAN -- OKAY SO

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.811
THE SECOND PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT

01:02:28.878 --> 01:02:30.680
PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS ON THIS

01:02:30.746 --> 01:02:34.383
PROPOSAL -- JUST TO KIND OF

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.852
REITERATE A LITTLE A LITTLE BIT

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.086
OF THE BACKGROUND TO MAKE SURE

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.287
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE SO THE

01:02:38.354 --> 01:02:40.456
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A

01:02:40.523 --> 01:02:41.991
THREE BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT --

01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:43.626
USING GENERAL FUND FUNDING AND

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:45.661
DISTRIBUTING DISTRIBUTING IT

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:49.265
AMONG -- FOUR OF THE FIVE PLANS

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.501
WITHIN CALPERS SO CALPERS IS NOT

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:53.402
JUST ONE PLAN IT'S IT'S

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.037
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON DON'T YOU

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:55.738
KNOW DIFFERENT KINDS --

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:56.772
CLASSIFICATIONS OF STATE

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:57.974
EMPLOYEES OF FOR EXAMPLE PEACE

01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.775
OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS HAVE

01:02:59.842 --> 01:03:00.877
ONE PLAN WITHIN CALPERS.

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.479
HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS HAVE A

01:03:03.546 --> 01:03:04.847
DIFFERENT PLAN.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:05.948
I'M SO THE FIVE BILLION THAT'S

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:06.582
RIGHT THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:07.049
CONTRIBUTION WOULD BE

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.117
DISTRIBUTED AS THE TABLE SHOWS

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.318
IN THE FIRST COLUMN AND IT WOULD

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:11.254
BE DISTRIBUTED TO THOSE PLANS

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:11.921
THAT RECEIVE GENERAL FUND

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.990
PAYMENT OF FOUR OF THE FIVE

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:15.424
EXCLUDING HIGHWAY PATROL.

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:16.792
THE NET SAVINGS THAT WOULD BE

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:18.461
REALIZED AS A RESULT OF THIS

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:20.263
PLAN ARE IN THE FINAL COLUMN OF

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.631
THE TABLE AND SO YOU CAN SEE

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:23.032
THAT THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.901
DOLLARS WOULD IN SAVINGS WOULD

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.969
BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG.

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.738
FOUR OF THOSE PLANS.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:29.939
THE GENERAL FUND WOULD RECEIVE

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.474
ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:32.608
THE SIX POINT THREE BILLION

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.876
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS AND THEN

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.912
OTHER FUNDS INCLUDING FEDERAL

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:36.512
FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE AND SPECIAL

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:37.446
FUNDS.

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.714
WOULD RECEIVE THE REMAINING

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.216
THREE POINT THREE BILLION

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:42.618
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS.

01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:45.821
BUT NOTABLY THE BECAUSE HIGHWAY

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:48.357
PATOL IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAN

01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:49.792
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:50.760
GENERAL FUND PAYMENTS THAT'S WHY

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.395
IT'S EXCLUDED FROM THE PLAN --

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.163
THE MAJOR FUND THAT PAYS HIGHWAY

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.832
PATROL OUT PENSION COSTS IS THE

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.334
MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT ONE OF THE

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.202
TWO MAJOR FUNDS IT PAYS IT.

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.903
AND SO MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT AS

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.104
A RESULT -- ACHIEVES LESS

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.606
SAVINGS THAN IT WOULD UNDER AN

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.609
ALTERNATIVE WHERE HIGHWAY PATROL

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.777
WERE INCLUDED IN THE PLAN.

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:08.844
SO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:10.179
PROVIDES OUR ASSESSMENT -- WE

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.248
NOTE THAT YOU KNOW IN CONTRAST

01:04:12.315 --> 01:04:13.449
TO THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:14.684
ABOUT CAL STARS WERE RE SAID

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:16.652
THERE WAS ONLY AN 80% CHANCE OF

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:17.520
ACHIEVING SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.221
TWO DECADES.

01:04:18.287 --> 01:04:20.957
THIS CALPERS PLAN HAS OVER 99%

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.326
CHANCE OF ACHIEVING SAVINGS OVER

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:24.393
THE NEXT FEW DECADES.

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.529
IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND THEREFORE

01:04:26.596 --> 01:04:29.699
YOU KNOW IT -- IS AT AND YOU

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.500
KNOW A AND A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.669
OF THIS PROPOSAL.

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:34.870
THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT.

01:04:34.937 --> 01:04:36.305
YEAH THE MAIN REASON FOR THAT

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.506
HAS TO DO WITH THE RATE SETTING

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.075
AUTHORITY -- BETWEEN THE TWO

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:43.980
SYSTEMS -- SO WALL CALPERS.

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:45.881
CITING AUTHORITY AND IF IT

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:46.549
EXPERIENCES AND INVESTMENT

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:47.717
LOSSES WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.352
WITH CAL STAR IS A CAN ADJUST

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:50.820
THE RATES CORRESPONDINGLY AND

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.521
MAKE UP FOR THAT LOSS -- CAL

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.990
STARS DOES NOT HAVE THAT FULL

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:59.362
LATITUDE -- UNDER STATE LAW.

01:04:59.428 --> 01:05:02.932
BUT ON ANYTHING.

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:03.199
SO IF IT.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.767
GOES BELOW AS WAS MENTIONED

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:07.436
EARLIER BELOW THE SEVEN YASSER

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:10.740
BECAUSE BELOW THE SEVEN THEN ALL

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:10.940
I CAN.

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:12.375
SAY.

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.143
WELL ARE THE ULTIMATE SAVINGS --

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.810
WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF SIX POINT

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:15.611
THREE ULTIMATELY IT WILL BE

01:05:15.678 --> 01:05:17.613
BASED ON WHAT THE FUND ACTUALLY

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.080
OR INSULT.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:19.615
THAT IS A VARIABLE AS TO HOW

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:21.217
MUCH YOU WILL SAVE BUT UNLIKE

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.285
THE CASTER SITUATION IT'S

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:24.420
VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE THAT THERE

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.521
WILL BE SAVINGS.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.790
OF JUST DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:31.594
THE RETURNS ARE.

01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:33.095
AGAIN IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:38.100
ABILITY. TWO CAN MAKE UP A LOT

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.336
AS A MAKE UP FOR THEM YEAR AFTER

01:05:40.403 --> 01:05:42.471
YEAR BY YEAR.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:44.173
WE WE S. OF CALPERS IS NOT HAVE

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:44.807
THE RESTRICTIONS THAT MR LAMBRO

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:45.975
TALK ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN ONLY

01:05:46.042 --> 01:05:47.276
INCREASE THE RATE BY HALF

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.778
PERCENT PER YEAR.

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:51.147
IF WE NEED TO WE INCREASE THE

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:54.350
RATES AND THE SO YEAH WE FORWARD

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:54.950
SETTING AUTHORITY AND THAT IS

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:58.254
WHY -- ONCE THE MONEY IS IN THE

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.388
PLAN THE ADDITIONAL EARNINGS

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:00.690
THEY GENERATE WHATEVER THEY ARE

01:06:00.756 --> 01:06:06.862
WILL BE A SAVINGS [inaudible]

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:11.033

CALPERS SCHOOL CLASSIFY PLAN I

THESE -- CALPERS DEFERRAL -- THE

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.146
REASON WE WANT TO THE MAIN

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:12.748
REASON WE WANT TO PAY THIS OFF

01:09:12.815 --> 01:09:13.616
OTHER THAN.

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:16.418
JUST BEING GOOD THIS CALL POLICY

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:19.054
IS -- DUE TO SOME FUNDING CHEST

01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:20.956
THAT OCCURRED MOVING -- THREE

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.291
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.826
GENERAL FUND PAYROLL TO OTHER

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:24.827

DOLLARS CHEAPER THIS YEAR.

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:36.572
SO BARRING ANY OTHER.

01:09:36.639 --> 01:09:37.840
FUNDING SHIFT OF THIS MAGNITUDE

01:09:37.907 --> 01:09:39.508
WHICH WE DON'T FORESEE HAPPENING.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:41.477
THIS IS.

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.112
AS CHEAP AS THIS IS GOING TO GET

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.613
THIS YEAR IT'S IT'S ON SALE

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.881
RIGHT NOW BASICALLY [inaudible]

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:48.951
SO -- IS THE PHONE IN THE

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.653
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU I CAN ANSWER

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.688
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE --

01:09:52.755 --> 01:09:58.961
RELATED TO EITHER OF THESE DEBTS.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:09:59.895
AS TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.964
HAND OUT PROVIDES OUR COMMENTS

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:05.501
ON THESE TWO DEFERRALS -- AT THE

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.536
TOP OF THE PAGE I AM SHOWING A

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.071
SUMMARY OF ALL OF THE

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.072
OUTSTANDING TO FOR ALSO THE CAN

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.540
STATE HOUSE AND ESSENTIALLY THIS

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:13.475
IS BECAUSE WE LAID OUT ANALYSIS

01:10:13.542 --> 01:10:14.977
RECENTLY WORRISOME OF COMPARED.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:15.811
THE DEFERRALS THAT THE

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.079
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES I'M

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:18.914
DOING AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:20.182
TO FOR ALL OF THE STATE ALREADY

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:22.284
HAS A THAT THE STATE ARE STILL

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:23.786
HAS -- ON THE BOOKS SO BUT I

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:26.021
WILL ALSO ADD THAT THE STATE HAD

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:27.256
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEFERRALS

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:29.124
RELATED TO EDUCATION PREVIOUSLY

01:10:29.191 --> 01:10:30.826
THAT HAVE ALL BEEN -- TOTALLY

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.361
REPAID SO THE STATE HAS ALSO

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.029
MADE IMPORTANT PROGRESS IN THIS

01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:36.732
AREA -- SINCE THE LAST RECESSION

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.534
THE THREE REMAINING CATEGORIES

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:39.902
OF PEARLS THAT ARE STILL

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.370
OUTSTANDING ARE THE PENSION AND

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:43.205
PAYROLL DEFERRALS AS THE

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.173
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.407
REPAYING BUT THEN ALSO A SET OF

01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:46.508
DEFERRALS.

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:47.910
RELATED TO THE MEDIC HEALTH

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:49.945
PROGRAM -- AND THE WAY THAT BOTH

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:52.247
THE PROGRAM IS BUDGET AND ALSO

01:10:52.314 --> 01:10:54.583
HOW -- COSTS ARE PAID WITHIN

01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:56.385
THAT PROGRAM.

01:10:56.452 --> 01:10:58.654
SO -- OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:00.155
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOUND --

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.057
THAT WE EVALUATED THE PROPOSAL

01:11:02.124 --> 01:11:03.325
ESSENTIALLY ON THREE DIFFERENT

01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:04.960
CRITERIA. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES IT

01:11:05.027 --> 01:11:06.295
IMPROVE THE STATE'S FISCAL

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.030
POSITION TO WHAT EXTENT DOES IT

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.366
IMPROVE SORT OF TRANSPARENCY AND

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:11.767
STATE BUDGETING PRACTICES.

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:12.968
AND THEN TO WHAT EXTENT IS IT

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:17.239
REDUCE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON

01:11:17.306 --> 01:11:19.308
OTHER ENTITIES.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:19.942
SO I'M DOING THESE TWO DEFERRALS

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.143
OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.311
WOULD IMPROVE THE STATE'S --

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.145
FISCAL POSITION BECAUSE

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:24.013
ESSENTIALLY BY UNDOING THESE

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:24.980
DEFERRALS TODAY IT GIVES THE

01:11:25.047 --> 01:11:26.215
STATE THE OPTION TO DO THEM

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.316
AGAIN IN THE FUTURE WHICH HAS

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:29.284
SOMETHING LIKE A BENEFIT SIMILAR

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:30.285
TO RESERVES.

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.388
IT ALSO MODERATELY IMPROVES THE

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.355
STATE'S FISCAL POSITION I'M

01:11:33.422 --> 01:11:35.224
SORRY OP FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.158
AND BUDGETING PRACTICES.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:39.261
BECAUSE IT BRINGS OUR ACCOUNTING

01:11:39.328 --> 01:11:40.496
DOCUMENTS INTO ALIGNMENT WITH

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:41.697
BUDGETARY DOCUMENTS.

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:43.232
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:45.100
ON OTHER ENTITIES -- THAT'S

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.435
BECAUSE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.504
STILL PAID RIGHT ON TIME ARE THE

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:49.905
PAYROLL DEFERRALS REALLY JUST AN

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.073
ACCOUNTING ACTION.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.207
AND WITH RESPECT TO THE PENSION

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.742
TO FOR ALL CALPERS HAS INDICATED

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:54.743
THAT THERE REALLY IN DIFFERENT

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.378
BETWEEN RECEIVING THEIR PAYMENT

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.746
YOU KNOW IF AT THE END OF JUNE

01:11:57.813 --> 01:12:00.883
VERSES IN A FEW DAYS LATER AT

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.084
THE BEGINNING OF JULY.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.185
SO WE LOOKED INTO THESE OTHER

01:12:03.252 --> 01:12:04.453
DEFERRALS AND ASKED YOU KNOW DO

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.321
THEY USE PERFORMED BETTER

01:12:06.388 --> 01:12:07.189
AGAINST THESE.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:09.425
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND WHAT

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:12.461
WE FOUND IS THAT UNLIKE THE TO

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.729
THE PENSION A PENSION PAYROLL TO

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:14.463
FOR ALL THE DON'T HAVE THESE

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.764
ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:17.099
BUT THERE IS ONE SET OF

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.200
DEFERRALS WITHIN THE MEDICAL

01:12:18.267 --> 01:12:19.668
PROGRAM THAT IS HAVING SOME

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.470
LIMITED ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.571
PROVIDERS.

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:24.740
SPECIFICALLY RURAL HOSPITALS IN

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:26.408
PARTICULAR -- AND PROVIDERS A

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.544
FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES WHERE

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.579
IS -- AS A RESULT OF THE DELAYED

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.514
PAYMENTS THEY CAN FACE SOME CASH

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:33.115
FLOW ISSUES I DON'T WANT TO

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.516
OVERSTATE HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.151
IS BUT IT IT IT IT DOES HAVING

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.253
SOME LIMITED MET -- ADVERSE

01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:38.921
EFFECTS.

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:39.888
SO WE HAVE A RECOMMENDED

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:41.523
ALTERNATIVE WHICH WOULD BE -- TO

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.392
NOT USE THE ONE POINT SEVEN

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.694
BILLION DOLLARS TO UNDO.

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.863
THE CALPERS -- DEFERRAL AND THE

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:49.031
PAYROLL TO FOR ALL.

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.699
AND TO INSTEAD ON DO THESE

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.101
SPECIFIC DEFERRALS IN THE

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.135
MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT ARE HAVING

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.803
THESE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES THAT

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:55.771
WOULD COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:56.238
MILLION.

01:12:56.305 --> 01:12:58.207
AND USE THE REMAINING FUNDS TO

01:12:58.273 --> 01:12:59.842
BUILD MORE RESERVES BUILDING

01:12:59.908 --> 01:13:02.745
MORE RESERVES -- WOULD BE.

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:03.779
WHAT DID SHE OF JUST A LITTLE

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:05.647
BIT MORE AND THAT GENERAL FUND

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.750
SAVINGS ON AN ONGOING BASIS THAN

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.218
ON DOING THESE DEFERRALS -- IT

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.652
WOULD BE LESS ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.121
COMPLEX TO IMPLEMENT THAN ON

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.522
DOING DEFERRALS AND THEN RE

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:15.357
DOING THEM AGAIN THE FUTURE AND

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:16.024
OF COURSE AS I ALREADY MENTIONED

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.292
THIS HAS THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:18.193
REDUCING THOSE ADVERSE

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.797
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME MEDICAL

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:25.734
PROVIDERS.

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.269
YES SORRY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:28.437
THE HAND OUT BUT JUST A COUPLE

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:30.739
THINGS I WANT TO SPEAK -- TO I

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:32.274
DON'T [inaudible]

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:37.513
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:41.550
NO [inaudible]

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.953
ANDERSON THANK -- YES SO.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.155
S. SPEAKING TO THE

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.291
ADMINISTRATIVE -- SAYS WITH ON

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.793
DOING SOME OF THESE DEFERRALS --

01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:52.628
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE AND DOING

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.295
THE MEDI CAL THE FOR ALL I DON'T.

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:57.733
THAT'S A I GET TO PLAY THERE I

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:57.933
GUESS.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.071
BUT WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY SOME

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:06.008
ONE DAY -- BUT I DO WANT TO

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.943
SPEAK -- TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:09.711
EASE OF ON DOING THESE DEFERRALS

01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:12.047
THAT I DO KNOW ABOUT -- I'M

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:13.015
DOING THESE BECAUSE THEY'RE KIND

01:14:13.081 --> 01:14:14.349
OF OFF THE BOOKS AND THE WAY

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:15.350
THEY'RE ADMINISTERED.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.886
THERE ARE SIMPLE IS JUST.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.822
NOT WE JUST DON'T DO THEM.

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:20.622
IT'S DONE THE WORKLOAD GOES WAY

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.191
THAT THAT GOES AWAY.

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:24.193
THIS IS PRETTY MUCH AS

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.594
ADMINISTRATIVELY SPEAKING THIS

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:28.030
IS ALMOST AS EASY AS IT GETS ITS

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:28.530
WORST.

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.365
AND THAT'S PART OF WHY WE WE

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.667
LOOK AT THESE TO FOR ALL THIS IS

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:32.634
KIND OF LOW HANGING.

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:37.306
FOR RIGHT NOW FOR US AS FAR AS

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:40.542
PAYING OFF DEBTS -- THE LA --

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:41.276
DATES IN THE RIGHT OUT IN THE

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:43.078
RIGHT UP TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.580
HOW THE MACCALLUM WANT -- THAT

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:45.113
MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:47.082
ADMINISTRATIVELY DIFFICULT TO

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.218
UNWIND AGAIN I DON'T WANT.

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.286
TO SPEAK TO THAT -- SO THAT'S

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:52.821
ONE THING WITH THIS ONE AND THEN

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.423
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:57.292
SAVINGS WITH THESE DEFERRALS BUT

01:14:57.359 --> 01:14:59.228
THE WAY THE PENSION TO FOR A

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:01.964
WORKS AND THE JUNE TO JULY

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.764
PAYROLL THE FOR THE FOR A WORKS

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:04.266
IS.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.133
IT.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.201
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE REALLY WANT

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:08.237
TO LOOK AT THIS AS SAVINGS SO AS

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:10.806
AS PAYROLL INCREASES YES YOU ARE

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:13.942
DIFFERENT MORE -- GENERAL FUND

01:15:14.009 --> 01:15:15.310
DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.

01:15:15.377 --> 01:15:18.680
BUT THAT DEFERRAL IS REALLY JUST

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:21.049

ABOUT OUR OUR APPROACH TO GRANT

MAKING THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.898

OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS -- HAS

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:27.801
DEVELOPED THE MODEL THAT WE

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.470
THINK REALLY WORKS IT'S PRETTY

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:31.005
UNORTHODOX.

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:31.905
I THINK THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:33.274
GRANT MAKING ESPECIALLY FROM

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:35.109
GOVERNMENT IS TO PUT MONEY OUT.

01:38:35.175 --> 01:38:38.078
I CALL IT UP PAY AND PRAY -- YOU

01:38:38.145 --> 01:38:40.014
PUT THE MONEY UP GRANTEES I DO

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:40.581
THE WORK THEY SAID THEY WERE

01:38:40.648 --> 01:38:41.715
GONNA DO WHEN THEY REPORT TO YOU

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.417
AT SOME POINT -- THAT THEY DID

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:44.118
THE WORK THEY SAID THEY WERE

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.185
GONNA DO AND THEY SPEND THE

01:38:45.252 --> 01:38:46.820
MONEY DOWN TO ZERO IT'S A

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:47.655
SUCCESS.

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:49.390
IN OUR MODEL WE DO A LOT OF HAND

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:52.660
HOLDING SO WE ALLOW GRANTEES.

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:55.629
TO MAKE MISTAKES -- ANALYZE

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:57.331
ALONG THE WAY AND ASSESS THEIR

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:58.299
THEIR PROGRESS IN THE PROGRAM TO

MEETING THEIR OUTCOMES THAT

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:00.301

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:04.471
REASSESSING CHANGE COURSE IF

GRANTEES THAT WE PROVIDE THIS

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:11.612
KIND OF HAND HOLDING THAT ALLOWS

THAT -- THAT TO TAKE PLACE --

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:15.749
BUT OUT OF THIS PROCESS ALSO

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.785
COMES A LOT OF INNOVATION A LOT

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:19.787
