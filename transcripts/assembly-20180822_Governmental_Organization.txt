WHILE ENSURING THAT IMPACTS ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE APPROPRIATELY MITIGATED. AGAIN -- THESE CONTACTS WILL BE IN FULL FORCE TWENTY FIVE YEARS FOR THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THESE COMPACTS ARE SIGNIFICANT SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL TO THOSE FOUND IN ALL THE COMPACTS RATIFIED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVEN TEAM AS IT RELATES TO LOCAL MITIGATION LABOR PROVISIONS HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS WORKERS COMPENSATION PATRON DISPUTES PROGRAMS TO MITIGATE PROBLEM GAMBLING. ON THE AMENDED COMPACT WITH THE UPPER LAKE TRIBE CONFORMS TO PROVISIONS OF ITS TWENTY ELEVEN COMPACT REGARDING WORKERS COMPENSATION LABOR RELATIONS TO THOSE. OF MORE RECENT COMPAQ'S. THE AMENDMENT TO THE TWENTY FIFTEEN COMPACT WITH THE SENATE AS BAND AUTHORIZES OFF TRACK WAGERING ON HORSE RACES AT A SATELLITE WAGERING FACILITY WITH DAN. DE EXISTING GAMING FACILITY. AYE LAST MISTER DILLON TO TOUCH ON THE SPECIFIC FINANCIAL TERMS OF THESE COMPAQ'S. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR WITNESSES IN ADVANCE FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF THEIR BUSY SCHEDULES TO BE WITH US TODAY. AND WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WILL BEGIN THE HEARING -- DO WE HAVE MISTER DILLON PRESIDENT. OKAY WILL BEGIN WITH BIG VALLEY WELCOME FIRST BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITH YOUR OVERVIEW AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM THE TRIBE AND SPECIAL GAS MISTER JACK RUBY -- YES SIR THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS OF THE COMPACT WITH -- BIG VALLEY -- AUTHORIZES THAT RIGHT TO GAMING FACILITIES IN UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED SLOT MACHINES OF THE TRIBE CURRENTLY OPERATES UNDER IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE TROUBLE STATE GAMING COMPACT THEIR REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND. ELIGIBLE TRIBE DIFFERENTLY OPERATING LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SLOTS. BUT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE NINETY NINE COMPAQ THEY STILL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY STF IN AND THERE WAS A TIME TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAD THE ABILITY TO GROW THAT THEY HAD TO PAY LICENSE FEES. UP PURSUANT TO THE TERMS THAT NINETY NINE COMPAQ. WHICH REFLECTED CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AT THAT TIME ABOUT WHO SHOULD PAY INTO THE STF IN AND HOW ARE STIFF WAS FUNDED WE'VE TRIED TO IN OUR RECENT NEGOTIATIONS -- COME UP WITH A MORE SUSTAINABLE A FRAMEWORK BASED ON THE ABILITY OF IT -- OF A TRIBE TO TO CONTRIBUTE TO ON THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND TRIBAL NATION GRANDSON. OF AND ENSURE THAT IT'S FAIR TO THE TRIBES THAT CONTRIBUTE AS WELL AS TO THOSE THAT RECEIVE SO UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK THE TRIBE. I WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND TRIBAL NATION GRANDSON THROUGH THE NEGOTIATIONS. WITH OTHER TRIBES -- WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT GOOD TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS THEY DO TO THE SEVENTY TWO RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES -- IN ADDITION EVEN THOUGH THAT THE LANGUAGE IN A COMPACT -- PROVIDES FOR A PRO RATA SHARE PAYMENT TO THE INDIAN GAMING SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND TO COVER THE STATE'S REGULATORY COSTS IN PROBLEM GAMBLING -- BUDGET LANGUAGE THIS YEAR AUTHORIZES THE STATE TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE ANY OBLIGATION THE TRIBE WOULD HAVE TO PAY. TIME TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO TO COVER THOSE COSTS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS FURTHERS THE STATE'S OBJECTIVES ENSURING THAT -- THOSE FUNDS ARE ARE ARE SOLVENT IN IN -- MEETING THEIR OBJECTIVES AND IT ACTUALLY REDUCES THE TRIBES OBLIGATIONS SIGNIFICANTLY TO MAKE PAYMENTS. THAT WITH THAT'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR TRADE OVER -- TO THE TROUBLE TREASURE. MANY WITHOUT CARLA RODRIGUEZ AND I'M FROM THE BIG VALLEY RANCHERIA VANNA PUMMELING IN SIAM DAY ELECTED -- TRIBAL COUNCIL TREASURE. AND I COME FROM A TRIBE OF ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED MEMBERS THAT SIX HUNDRED EIGHT VOTING -- ADULTS OVER TWENTY ONE AND THE RESEARCH CHILDREN. SO -- YOU KNOW THE GAMING REVENUE IS -- SUBSTANTIAL FOR AT THE HOT CONTINUED OPERATION FOR A TRIBAL GOVERNMENT -- ALSO TO SUPPORT THE TRIBAL MEMBERS SUCH AS HIGHER EDUCATION BENEFITS -- HOUSING -- YOU KNOW JUST JUST STAR. REMODELING AND AND UPDATING OF OF OLD EXISTING HOUSING THAT WE HAVE OUT THERE SO -- AGAIN A SISSY OVER HERE TOO I'M HERE TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF YOU KNOW GETTING OUR CONTACT RATIFIED AND APPROVED.

AND JUST TO PUT A PERIOD ON THAT PARAGRAPH IS THAT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER SEVEN THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE TRIBAL GAMING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. WHO NEGOTIATE DIRECTLY WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS OVER THE ISSUE OF WAGES AND BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS SO THESE AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE YEARS HAVE NOT ONLY? LIFTED THE TRIBES UP OUT OF POVERTY [inaudible] IT'S LIFTED. QUITE A FEW THOUSAND WORKERS UP AT A POVERTY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT IS A TOTAL POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY SINCE ATRASO. WE JUST WANT TO SAY AT THE END OF THE JERRY BROWN ADMINISTRATION THE END OF EACH OF JAIL AND HIS. THE NEGOTIATOR FOR THESE COMPACTS THAT.

I WOULD BE LIMITED TO HAVE NO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED GAMING DEVICES. THAT -- GROWTH WOULD KICK IN IN THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO OTHER TRIBES PAYMENT OBLIGATION. UP UNTIL THEN TO ALLOW THE TRIED TO RAMP UP TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR THE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE CREDITS -- UP UNTIL THEN THE TRIBE PAY ITS STF.

OKAY WILL BRING ABOUT THE MEMBERS -- FOR QUESTIONS ALL KICK IT OFF -- BASKING RIDGE DO IF HE MIGHT GIVE US AN UPDATE ON THE RST HALF. GEN STF FUNDS -- GREAT QUESTION CHAIRMAN I DON'T HAVE THE THE NUMBERS -- AT MY FINGERTIPS LIKE IT'S ONLY PROVIDE THAT TO STAFF BUT I THINK THAT -- THE BOTH FUNDS HERE AND A GOOD POSITION I THINK THE COMMISSION REPORTED OUT -- DURING THE BUDGET PROCESS ON THE STATUS OF THE ARTS TF AND IT LOOKED LIKE A BELIEVE AT THAT TIME THAT THERE WOULD BE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN EXCESS OF THE ROUGHLY EIGHTY MILLION THAT WAS REQUIRED TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS THE SEVENTY TWO RCF ELIGIBLE TRIBES THAT. ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD UP FORM THE BASIS OF WHAT -- WOULD BE IN THAT TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND -- THE BILL THAT YOUR AUTHORING I BELIEVE GOT OUT OF THE SENATE IS HEADED TO THE ASSEMBLY -- NOW SO -- THAT FUND IS IN A GOOD PLACE THE STF LIKEWISE I THINK -- EXCEEDS ITS OBLIGATIONS BY. I THINK SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS IN TERMS OF WHERE THE FUND IS CURRENTLY AT I THINK THE MOST RECENT APPROPRIATIONS. OF WITH TO COVER THE COSTS OF THE THE STATE GAMING AGENCY AND AND THAT THE COMMISSIONTHE BUREAU IN IN THOSE ENTITIES THAT SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION THE COMPACTS AND PROBLEM GAMBLING. WAS ROUGHLY THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS I THINK THE STATUS OF THE FUND IS IS NOT THE FORTY WE'VE NEGOTIATED COMPACTS THAT. FOR THE MOST PART USING A PRO RATA FORMULA -- SOME THE LARGER TRIED TO PAYING MORE THAN THEIR SHARE -- AND SO I I THINK THAT AS WE LOOK OUT IS ALWAYS HARD TO TELL WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE FUNDS THAT FUND WILL BE IN A IN A GOOD POSITION GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY -- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. WELL IN CONCLUDING AROUND THE SCHOOL. JUST WAVING HELLO. MR DEL AND THANK YOU.
