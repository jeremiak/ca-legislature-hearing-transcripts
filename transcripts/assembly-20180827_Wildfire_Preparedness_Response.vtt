01:13:11.787 --> 01:13:17.059 region:rollup2
OF IMPORTING.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:18.861 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT --

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:20.496 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS THAT WE THINK COULD

01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:21.864 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE REFLECTED IN THIS A

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:24.400 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT.

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:26.269 region:rollup2
A BECAUSE CLEARLY.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.270 region:rollup2
WE SEE THE STATE BURNING.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:27.570 region:rollup2
OF FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:31.073 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.875 region:rollup2
AND NOT.

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:34.410 region:rollup2
HAVING ANY CONNECTION.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.444 region:rollup2
OF THEIR WE'RE AWARE OF TO

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:37.113 region:rollup2
UTILITIES.

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:38.214 region:rollup2
THE CAUSE.

01:13:37.113 --> 01:13:39.382 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S AN ISSUE OUT

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:40.650 region:rollup2
THERE PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:13:39.382 --> 01:13:41.317 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED WE NEED TO GET OUR

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.318 region:rollup2
ARMS AROUND IT AND I THINK THIS

01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:44.020 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:47.189 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT ANOTHER

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:49.558 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT A PART OF IT IS THAT.

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:51.127 region:rollup2
OF SECURITY FOR THE WORK FORCE

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:52.728 region:rollup2
WORKER PROTECTION.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:54.130 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN ELEMENT IN THIS

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:55.965 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT ADDRESSES WORKER

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.300 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:58.100 region:rollup2
BECAUSE UNDER THE WILL WORST

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:01.504 region:rollup2
CASE SCENARIO [inaudible]

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:02.438 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS A BANKRUPTCY OR

01:14:01.504 --> 01:14:04.073 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF A SITUATION THAT

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.574 region:rollup2
CAUSES --

01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:07.443 region:rollup2
UTILITIES OUR WORKERS TO BE PUT

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:07.977 region:rollup2

ADDRESS THAT.

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:13.316 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.950 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS.

01:14:13.316 --> 01:14:17.753 region:rollup2
AND THERE DETAILS CERTAINLY

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:20.022 region:rollup2

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:59.982 region:rollup2
PLACE OF ENORMOUS PROSPERITY.

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:02.585 region:rollup2
FOR A VERY LARGE SEGMENT OF

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:03.953 region:rollup2

OR OVER EXAGGERATED.

01:17:18.601 --> 01:17:22.972 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE EXAMPLES

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:26.395 region:rollup2
HARDENING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:28.264 region:rollup2
TO THE SATISFACTION OF A THIRD

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.632 region:rollup2
PARTY --

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:31.133 region:rollup2
GROUP -- AT

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:32.735 region:rollup2
THE WAY I I READ IT I DON'T KNOW

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:35.437 region:rollup2
IF I READ IT CORRECTLY THAT THAT

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
WILL BE A COSTS IS BORN TO THE

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:39.375 region:rollup2
RATEPAYERS --

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:40.876 region:rollup2
I'M CONCERNED THE RATE PAYERS

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:42.478 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:43.879 region:rollup2
INCREASES --

01:19:42.478 --> 01:19:45.381 region:rollup2
NO MATTER WHAT THE ACTIONS OF

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:46.849 region:rollup2
THIS 䥡MITTEE

01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:50.052 region:rollup2
AND WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT A

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:52.721 region:rollup2
BASIC PREMISE. TO THE P. YOU SEE

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:54.990 region:rollup2
AND AUTHORIZING --

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:57.459 region:rollup2
PROFIT CENTER BY FOR PROFIT --

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:59.461 region:rollup2
UTILITIES THAT IT SHOULD BE AN

01:19:57.459 --> 01:20:02.564 region:rollup2
INCUMBENT RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:04.500 region:rollup2
UTILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:06.035 region:rollup2
OPERATING SAFELY IN ACCORDANCE

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:08.003 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE LAWS AND STATE

01:20:06.035 --> 01:20:12.207 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND AND AND AND SUBJECT

TO THIRD PARTY VERIFICATIONS --

01:20:12.207 --> 01:20:14.977 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:16.178 region:rollup2
THAT -- YOU

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:17.146 region:rollup2
KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:20:16.178 --> 01:20:20.382 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET IN THERE AND DO

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:22.151 region:rollup2
SENATE -- I

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:23.485 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE THE LANGUAGE OF

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:25.754 region:rollup2
SAYS THAT WE CAN GO ON TO

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:27.589 region:rollup2
FEDERAL --

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:28.490 region:rollup2
FORESTS THAT --

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:30.526 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:32.528 region:rollup2
ALREADY SUBJECT TO NIPAH WITHOUT

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:33.896 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THE DUPLICATIVE

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:35.864 region:rollup2
SEQUEL PROCESS.

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:37.199 region:rollup2
I'M NOT STE I'M STILL NOT CLEAR

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:38.567 region:rollup2
YET MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:40.769 region:rollup2
TELL ME ABOUT HOW WE GOING TO

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:42.838 region:rollup2
STATE PROPERTIES AND IF THERE'S

01:20:40.769 --> 01:20:44.773 region:rollup2
ANY STREAMLINING THE ALLOW US TO

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:47.710 region:rollup2
FAN -- BRUSH

01:20:44.773 --> 01:20:48.477 region:rollup2
AND A HUNDRED TWENTY DEAD OR

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:49.812 region:rollup2
DYING.

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:51.547 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN USE

01:20:49.812 --> 01:20:52.781 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE LOGS FOR LUMBER

01:20:51.547 --> 01:20:55.484 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN JUST --

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:57.052 region:rollup2
BURNING THEM UP --

01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:58.854 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.421 region:rollup2
THAT -- WE

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.956 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE ALLOWING FOR

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:02.958 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:04.927 region:rollup2
SOME STREAMLINING AND OTHER

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:06.161 region:rollup2
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES AND

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:08.931 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT I SEE A

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:09.832 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR --

01:21:08.931 --> 01:21:12.368 region:rollup2
WINDOW --

01:21:09.832 --> 01:21:12.968 region:rollup2
AFTER WHICH I THINK THINGS GO

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:14.703 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE WAY THAT THEY WERE

01:21:12.968 --> 01:21:16.138 region:rollup2
WITCHES.

01:21:14.703 --> 01:21:18.207 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY HASN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:20.709 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN.

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:22.978 region:rollup2
EMBRACE A DOCUMENT WITH A FIVE

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:24.313 region:rollup2
YEAR SUNSET AND ACCOMPLISH ALL

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:25.814 region:rollup2
THE GOALS THAT NEED TO BE DONE

01:21:24.313 --> 01:21:27.583 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THE STATE'S SAFER I

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:29.118 region:rollup2
THINK WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT

01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:33.989 region:rollup2
LEAST A TEN YEAR WINDOW.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:35.457 region:rollup2
OF OF EXPEDITION --

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:36.492 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT --

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:38.560 region:rollup2
THE P. YOU SEE --

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:39.928 region:rollup2
IS GOING.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.196 region:rollup2
TO THE MANDATE TO HAVE A

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:43.432 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP A CLOSER

01:21:41.196 --> 01:21:44.032 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH CAL FIRE TO

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.000 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN PREACHING

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:46.535 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.805 region:rollup2
HELLFIRE CERTAINLY HAS THE THE

01:21:46.535 --> 01:21:52.574 region:rollup2
EXPERTISE AND ENSURING THAT --

01:21:49.805 --> 01:21:54.576 region:rollup2
WIRES ARE PROPERLY --

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:56.512 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AS FAR AS RUSSIAN AND

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:57.679 region:rollup2
TREES AROUND THEM --

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:58.847 region:rollup2
THEY NEED THEY NEED TO BE

01:21:57.679 --> 01:22:00.115 region:rollup2
TALKING MORE WHEN YOU WE LEARNED

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:02.551 region:rollup2
WE ONLY HAVE THIRTY AUDITOR'S

01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:04.086 region:rollup2
THAT -- WERE

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:05.687 region:rollup2
WORKING FOR THE PC TO ENSURE

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.655 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE OF HUNDREDS

01:22:05.687 --> 01:22:08.290 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS OF MILES OF

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:09.625 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE.

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:13.462 region:rollup2
ARE ARE SAFE --

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:15.130 region:rollup2
FOR OUR COMMUNITIES --

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:15.998 region:rollup2
ANOTHER CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.399 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOR GOING TO GET TO

01:22:15.998 --> 01:22:17.1000 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE MORE RURAL AREAS

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:19.868 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF DEAD

01:22:17.1000 --> 01:22:20.969 region:rollup2
TREES AT THERE'S A PROVISION IN

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:22.771 region:rollup2
HERE THAT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:23.272 region:rollup2
RECRUITS IT YOU CAN HAVE A SIX

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:25.908 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FOOT.

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:27.276 region:rollup2
ROAD TO GET EQUIPMENT IN THERE

01:22:25.908 --> 01:22:28.577 region:rollup2
TO CLEAR THE TREES.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:30.312 region:rollup2
HE OTHERS ANOTHER REQUIREMENT IN

01:22:28.577 --> 01:22:32.614 region:rollup2
HERE THAT.

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:34.550 region:rollup2
THE SIX HUNDRED FOOT ROADS

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:36.718 region:rollup2
LITERALLY CANNOT BE --

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:37.319 region:rollup2
CONNECTED TO ONE ANOTHER AND I

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.587 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:40.255 region:rollup2
GET DEEP --

01:22:38.587 --> 01:22:41.390 region:rollup2
INTO SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:43.892 region:rollup2
ARE INUNDATED WITH A LOT OF

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:46.161 region:rollup2
THOSE DEAD TREES AND BRUSH

01:22:43.892 --> 01:22:48.330 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATELY CLEAR THEM --

01:22:46.161 --> 01:22:48.931 region:rollup2
TO LEASE CREATE FIREBREAKS TO

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.966 region:rollup2
ASSURE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:52.768 region:rollup2
SEE -- A

01:22:50.966 --> 01:22:54.736 region:rollup2
RESURGENCE IF YOU WILL OF THIS

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:56.839 region:rollup2
CONTINUATION OF THIS FIRE SEASON

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:57.906 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNICALLY SHOULD NOT EVEN

01:22:56.839 --> 01:22:59.575 region:rollup2
BE BEGUN YET.

01:22:57.906 --> 01:23:00.809 region:rollup2
SO WE WE MAY JUST BE BIG THAT AT

01:22:59.575 --> 01:23:04.112 region:rollup2
THE BEGINNING.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:05.981 region:rollup2
OF OF HER EVEN MORE HORRIFIC OF

01:23:04.112 --> 01:23:07.916 region:rollup2
FIRE SEASON THAT WE'VE --

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.218 region:rollup2
WE'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR --

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:10.319 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THE SERVING ON THIS

01:23:09.218 --> 01:23:11.286 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:12.988 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTS OF ME BEING IN THE

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:14.556 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND WORKING WITH ALL

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:17.493 region:rollup2
OF YOU AND HEARING YOUR ALL YOUR

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:19.127 region:rollup2
POINTS OF VIEW --

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:21.330 region:rollup2
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE HAVE

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:22.898 region:rollup2
SUCH A QUICK AT DEADLINE THAT WE

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.433 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING.

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:26.268 region:rollup2
IN PRINT AND SOMETHING THAT WE

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:28.003 region:rollup2
ALL CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:30.539 region:rollup2
VOTING ON PRIOR.

THE THE BILL --

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:35.277 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH TIME TO

01:23:34.142 --> 01:23:36.478 region:rollup2
GET IT DONE WE'RE JUST GONNA%

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:37.946 region:rollup2
HAVE TO WORK EXTRA HARD IN THE

NEXT --

01:23:37.946 --> 01:23:40.716 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO DO IT IN

01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:42.517 region:rollup2

AS THEY HAVE IN TRYING TO GET US

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.903 region:rollup2
TO THIS POINT THIS IS NOT A

01:23:57.1000 --> 01:24:03.138 region:rollup2
EASY.

01:24:00.903 --> 01:24:04.740 region:rollup2
ISSUE IT'S COMPLICATED HAS A LOT

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:06.842 region:rollup2

WE HAVE A A MASSIVE.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:31.686 region:rollup2

[inaudible]

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:35.257 region:rollup2
SO.

01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:35.891 region:rollup2
MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM THE

SECOND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT MISTER

01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:38.727 region:rollup2
WOULD.

01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:39.961 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:26:38.727 --> 01:26:42.030 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FOR YEARS

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:43.999 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:46.101 region:rollup2
AND WE RAN BILLS.

01:26:43.999 --> 01:26:47.536 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSE AND

01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:48.170 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN TWEAKED AT THE END

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:49.771 region:rollup2
TO WHERE THEY DON'T WORK ON THE

01:26:48.170 --> 01:26:51.606 region:rollup2
GROUND.

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:52.974 region:rollup2
BUT IT FEELS GOOD THAT YOU SAID

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:54.676 region:rollup2
YOU PASSED A BILL BUT WHEN YOU

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:56.278 region:rollup2
GO TO IMPLEMENT IT ON THE ACTUAL

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:58.713 region:rollup2
FOR GROUND.

01:26:56.278 --> 01:27:00.649 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T WORK.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:02.551 region:rollup2
SO I READ THROUGH THE FIRST

01:27:00.649 --> 01:27:04.453 region:rollup2
COUPLE PAGES LAST NIGHT TO SOME

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:07.089 region:rollup2
OF THE LANGUAGES BEEN CROSSED.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:07.656 region:rollup2
AND I WAS SURE YOU.

01:27:07.089 --> 01:27:10.192 region:rollup2
THAT IT WILL NOT WORK ON THE

01:27:07.656 --> 01:27:11.226 region:rollup2
GROUND.

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:14.096 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE THINGS IN THERE

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:16.131 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:17.666 region:rollup2
ARCHAEOLOGY ARCHEOLOGY STUDIES

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:19.468 region:rollup2

HARVEST PRODUCTION OFF OF TWO

01:27:21.136 --> 01:27:25.240 region:rollup2
OFF OF TIMBER PRODUCTION ZONES

01:27:23.772 --> 01:27:26.308 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.776 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY CLEARED A THREE HUNDRED

01:27:26.308 --> 01:27:28.376 region:rollup2
FOOT.

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:29.811 region:rollup2

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:34.649 region:rollup2
BUT ONLY THAT'S NECESSARY.

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:36.318 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO GET. TO THE

01:27:34.649 --> 01:27:37.586 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE.

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:39.454 region:rollup2
WE HAVE REAL [inaudible]

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:41.223 region:rollup2

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:42.190 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSTITUENTS

01:27:41.223 --> 01:27:44.259 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED USE

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:45.660 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:47.395 region:rollup2
THE DOLLYWOOD BILL OR DOLLYWOOD

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:50.766 region:rollup2

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:56.104 region:rollup2
SHARE TODAY WE HAD SOME SERIOUS

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:58.073 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT --

01:27:56.104 --> 01:28:00.075 region:rollup2
MY STAFF HAS MET WITH THE STAFF

01:27:58.073 --> 01:28:01.143 region:rollup2
OF THE SENATE AND WITH ASSEMBLY

01:28:00.075 --> 01:28:02.978 region:rollup2
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE SEEN SOME

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:04.546 region:rollup2
CHANGES COME FORTH.

01:28:02.978 --> 01:28:05.780 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE

01:28:04.546 --> 01:28:07.015 region:rollup2

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:09.050 region:rollup2
WEEKS AGO DREW A LINE IN THE

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.652 region:rollup2
SAND AND SAID.

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:12.053 region:rollup2
I'M NOT MOVING UNLESS WE DO SOME

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:13.989 region:rollup2
SERIOUS FUEL VEGETATION

01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:15.724 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT OUT THERE.

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:17.759 region:rollup2
NOW WITH THAT.

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:19.728 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO HAVE.

01:28:17.759 --> 01:28:20.796 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES.

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:24.666 region:rollup2
HE ASKED FOR THREE HUNDRED

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:25.567 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. FOR FOUR YEARS.

01:28:24.666 --> 01:28:27.636 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WHEN YOU GO TO PUT THAT

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:28.737 region:rollup2

HOW YOU CAN NOT GET THAT

01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:31.306 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE DONE AND THERE'S LOTS

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.574 region:rollup2
OF PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND I GET

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:34.776 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:28:32.574 --> 01:28:35.944 region:rollup2
BUT TO DO STREAMLINING AND NOT

01:28:34.776 --> 01:28:36.912 region:rollup2
PUTTING MONEY WITH IT IS DOING A

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:39.080 region:rollup2
DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:28:36.912 --> 01:28:39.714 region:rollup2
BURNING UP OUT THERE.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.416 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

SERIOUS RESOURCES IN THEIR

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:46.121 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE ARE MEETING MORE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:48.290 region:rollup2
CARBON AND WE ARE BURNING PEOPLE

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:48.924 region:rollup2
UP AND WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT AT

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:51.226 region:rollup2
THE PATIENTS GO WE NEED TO DO IT

01:28:48.924 --> 01:28:52.627 region:rollup2
AT IF WE DON'T.

01:28:51.226 --> 01:28:53.995 region:rollup2
PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:55.497 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE ON ON FORCE

01:28:53.995 --> 01:28:56.031 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT.

01:28:55.497 --> 01:28:57.365 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST FORCE MAYBE

01:28:56.031 --> 01:28:59.134 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AND I WILL

01:28:57.365 --> 01:29:00.502 region:rollup2
SHARE WITH YOU.

01:28:59.134 --> 01:29:01.303 region:rollup2
STREAMLINING PROCESSES THAT

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:03.271 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THOSE

01:29:01.303 --> 01:29:04.005 region:rollup2
WHO LIVE.

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.440 region:rollup2
IN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S AN

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:07.108 region:rollup2
ACTUAL TREE THAT HOUSE OF VALUE

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.976 region:rollup2
IT.

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:10.412 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GONNA NEED THE MONEY

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:12.681 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS SOMEBODY WHO LIVES.

01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:14.049 region:rollup2
IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S BRUSH.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:15.317 region:rollup2
AND THAT A LOT OF THIS STATE

01:29:14.049 --> 01:29:16.785 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA NEED.

01:29:15.317 --> 01:29:19.187 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES TO GO AHEAD AND

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:21.256 region:rollup2
MANAGE A BRUSH BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:21.856 region:rollup2
JUST PUT FIRE IN IT IT AND THAT

01:29:21.256 --> 01:29:24.025 region:rollup2

THE MATCH.

01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:26.995 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT VERY

01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:28.997 region:rollup2
CLEAR THE SECOND PART I WANT TO

01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:31.166 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT IS THAT.

01:29:28.997 --> 01:29:31.733 region:rollup2

UTILITIES.

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:45.647 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A HUGE A LIABILITY

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.582 region:rollup2
IN THE WAY WE'RE STRUCTURED

01:29:45.647 --> 01:29:51.152 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

PUSHED OFF.

01:30:00.562 --> 01:30:04.232 region:rollup2
TO UTILITY AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:06.067 region:rollup2
IN THE US THE GENIE CASE WHERE

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.269 region:rollup2
THEY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS.

01:30:06.067 --> 01:30:07.936 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

I'M OKAY WITHOUT THAT'S THE

01:30:13.208 --> 01:30:15.910 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT.

WAS IN PLACE.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:20.382 region:rollup2

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:46.775 region:rollup2
THE INVESTORS NEED TO PAY.

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:47.943 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I BELIEVE.

01:30:46.775 --> 01:30:49.844 region:rollup2
INVESTORS NEED TO HAVE SKIN IN

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:51.313 region:rollup2
THE GAME AND SO.

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:52.480 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU PUT

01:30:51.313 --> 01:30:53.148 region:rollup2
THIS IN LANGUAGE BUT I'M JUST

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.049 region:rollup2
GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:55.784 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:30:54.049 --> 01:30:57.185 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A PROCESS THAT WOULD.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:58.787 region:rollup2
ALLOW US TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO

01:30:57.185 --> 01:31:01.356 region:rollup2
GO.

01:30:58.787 --> 01:31:01.990 region:rollup2
AND IT WOULD HELD HARMLESS.

01:31:01.356 --> 01:31:05.126 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:06.661 region:rollup2
HELD HARMLESS I THINK WE SHOULD.

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:09.064 region:rollup2
FOR THE TWO THOUSAND AND

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:10.865 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN FIRES [inaudible]

01:31:09.064 --> 01:31:14.569 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD.

01:31:10.865 --> 01:31:17.105 region:rollup2
TELL THE UTILITY. TO PAY THE THE

01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:18.340 region:rollup2
INVESTORS TO PAY AS MUCH ADD TO

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:20.075 region:rollup2
A POT OF MONEY.

01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:22.143 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN IF THEY CAN AFFORD

01:31:20.075 --> 01:31:24.312 region:rollup2
WITHOUT GOING BANKRUPT.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.780 region:rollup2
SO LET'S JUST PICK A NUMBER.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:27.415 region:rollup2
LETS SAY THAT THEY DID A STRESS

01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:29.551 region:rollup2
TEST ON THEIR E. ON THERE AND

01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:30.885 region:rollup2

01:31:29.551 --> 01:31:33.288 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ALL THIS ON PICKING A

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:33.855 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF HOPE IT'S SIX AND WE

01:31:33.288 --> 01:31:37.325 region:rollup2
PUT OUT A POT AND WE SAY TO

01:31:33.855 --> 01:31:38.360 region:rollup2
THEM.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:39.894 region:rollup2
NOBODY GOES INTO A POT AND IT

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:42.397 region:rollup2
AND IT STAYS IN THAT POT AND WE

01:31:39.894 --> 01:31:43.498 region:rollup2
DON'T CHANGE ANY OF THE RULES

01:31:42.397 --> 01:31:44.833 region:rollup2
FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:46.334 region:rollup2

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:57.779 region:rollup2
SO THAT TAKES CARE OF THEM NOT

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.947 region:rollup2
BEING BAKER EARLY THAT WOULD

01:31:57.779 --> 01:32:00.882 region:rollup2
PREVENT BANKRUPTCY BUT WE'RE

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:02.617 region:rollup2
PUTTING THAT TO THE SIDE THEN

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:04.185 region:rollup2

HAPPENED IN.

01:32:43.825 --> 01:32:48.596 region:rollup2
MISTER WOODS DISTRICT WERE A

01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:49.697 region:rollup2
TREE BLEW LAMB BLUE FROM OUTSIDE

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2
THEIR CLEAR ZONE THEY DID

01:32:49.697 --> 01:32:52.333 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING RIGHT AND IT BLEW

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:54.736 region:rollup2
INTO THEIR TREE.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:55.904 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THE FIRE.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:57.338 region:rollup2
SO THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY WERE

01:32:55.904 --> 01:33:00.108 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO DO RIGHT WE'VE TOLD

01:32:57.338 --> 01:33:01.776 region:rollup2
THEM TO HARDEN UP THEIR SYSTEM.

01:33:00.108 --> 01:33:03.611 region:rollup2
BUT IT IT HIT THE LINES OF THE

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:04.646 region:rollup2
LINE BECAUSE THE FIRE SO WE

01:33:03.611 --> 01:33:06.381 region:rollup2

01:33:04.646 --> 01:33:08.116 region:rollup2
SOME PARAMETERS TO PC FOR THE P.

01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:09.317 region:rollup2

WELL THEY DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.686 region:rollup2
THEY'VE TRIED TO PROTECT THEIR

RATE PAYERS THEY DID EVERYTHING

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:15.056 region:rollup2
IN THEIR INNATE IN THEIR POWER

01:33:13.388 --> 01:33:15.757 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW NOT TO GOD LET THIS

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:19.327 region:rollup2
LINE THERE.

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:20.595 region:rollup2
SO THERE 10% LIABLE THEIR 50%

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:22.797 region:rollup2
LIABLE THERE IF THERE ARE SOME.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:23.798 region:rollup2
A FORMULA THAT COMES UP WITH

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:25.433 region:rollup2
SAYS THEY'RE LIABLE AND FOR

01:33:23.798 --> 01:33:27.502 region:rollup2

THEM SECURITY TO MOVE FORWARD

01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:40.682 region:rollup2

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:25.346 region:rollup2
TALKING AT THE IN PUTTING SOME

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:25.980 region:rollup2
THINGS AT THE PAPER AND ALL OF A

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:27.849 region:rollup2
SUDDEN BECAME A FOUR POINT PLAN

01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:29.250 region:rollup2
--

01:36:27.849 --> 01:36:30.218 region:rollup2
AND THEN LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.853 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMING THE MAYES PLANET

01:36:30.218 --> 01:36:33.588 region:rollup2
PREFER NOT TO BE CALLED THE

01:36:31.853 --> 01:36:38.059 region:rollup2
MAYES PLEDGES TO HIS TO REALLY.

01:36:33.588 --> 01:36:38.893 region:rollup2
BUT

01:36:38.059 --> 01:36:39.827 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS.

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:41.162 region:rollup2
IF YOU KNOW THE FIRST PART OF

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.497 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE AND I THINK YOU

01:36:41.162 --> 01:36:43.798 region:rollup2
GOT A COPY IN FRONT OF YOU.

01:36:42.497 --> 01:36:46.668 region:rollup2
BUT WOULD BE THAT THE DOLLYWOOD

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:47.969 region:rollup2
REGULATION AT CHANGES IN REGARDS

01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:49.604 region:rollup2
TO OUR FORCE MANAGEMENT AND FIRE

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:50.872 region:rollup2
PREVENTION OF THE SECOND PART OF

01:36:49.604 --> 01:36:51.439 region:rollup2
IT WOULD BE --

01:36:50.872 --> 01:36:54.642 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:36:51.439 --> 01:36:56.778 region:rollup2
FUND THAT --

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:58.780 region:rollup2
THAT FED FORCE MANAGEMENT AND IN

01:36:56.778 --> 01:37:00.348 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION AND IN THE THIRD

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:02.684 region:rollup2
ONE WOULD BE DEALING WITH OUR

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:04.352 region:rollup2
PAST INCIDENTS WHICH WE ALL KNOW

01:37:02.684 --> 01:37:04.852 region:rollup2
THAT TO BE.

01:37:04.352 --> 01:37:05.953 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE

01:37:04.852 --> 01:37:08.489 region:rollup2
QUESTION OF WHETHER WE NEED TO

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:09.724 region:rollup2
SECURE TIES WITH A STRESS TEST.

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:11.959 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:37:09.724 --> 01:37:12.593 region:rollup2
SHAREHOLDERS NAM BEAR THE BRUNT

01:37:11.959 --> 01:37:14.529 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE IS SOME LIABILITY

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:16.664 region:rollup2
--

01:37:14.529 --> 01:37:18.833 region:rollup2
THAT'S THERE BEFORE RATE PAYERS

01:37:16.664 --> 01:37:20.802 region:rollup2
WOULD PROVIDE I'M ANY COVER UP

01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:21.869 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND UNDER THAT OLD RULE

01:37:20.802 --> 01:37:23.971 region:rollup2
WE WOULD USE THE EXISTING

01:37:21.869 --> 01:37:25.606 region:rollup2
PRUDENT MANAGE MANAGER STANDARD

01:37:23.971 --> 01:37:26.541 region:rollup2
I'M EXISTING UPROOTED MANAGER

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:27.909 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:28.910 region:rollup2
AT ON THE FOURTH AND FINAL THING

01:37:27.909 --> 01:37:30.511 region:rollup2
IS IN REGARDS TO FUTURE

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:33.047 region:rollup2
INCIDENTS AND THAT WOULD BE A

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:35.316 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH A COST RECOVERY.

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:36.384 region:rollup2
A MAKING SURE THAT FAULT THIS IS

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:38.086 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THEIR

01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:39.520 region:rollup2
FAULT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:41.723 region:rollup2
WOULD BE ON THE HOOK IF.

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.258 region:rollup2
A THERE WAS A ANY LIABILITY THAT

01:37:41.723 --> 01:37:46.027 region:rollup2
WAS CAUSED BY --

01:37:44.258 --> 01:37:46.828 region:rollup2
THE THAT THAT THE COMPANIES.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.662 region:rollup2

01:37:46.828 --> 01:37:49.130 region:rollup2
WANTED FAULT.

01:37:47.662 --> 01:37:51.666 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WOULD THAT COULD BE

01:37:49.130 --> 01:37:52.300 region:rollup2
PASSED ALONG A TO TO RATEPAYERS

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:54.469 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW WHEN WE FIRST STARTED

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:38.379 region:rollup2
THESE DISCUSSIONS --

01:38:36.644 --> 01:38:41.849 region:rollup2
I WAS TROUBLED [inaudible]

01:38:38.379 --> 01:38:44.485 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHILE WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:45.553 region:rollup2
UTILITIES WE HAVE --

01:38:44.485 --> 01:38:47.455 region:rollup2
WE HAVE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE

01:38:45.553 --> 01:38:48.055 region:rollup2
HAD --

01:38:47.455 --> 01:38:50.358 region:rollup2
ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING VICTIMS

01:38:48.055 --> 01:38:52.393 region:rollup2
--

01:38:50.358 --> 01:38:54.128 region:rollup2
WE HAVE OUR OUR OUR WORKERS WHO

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:55.396 region:rollup2
WORK WITH UTILITIES.

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.030 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE THAT WAS A REALLY

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:58.032 region:rollup2
BEING DISCUSSED MUCH WAS VICTIMS

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:59.500 region:rollup2
--

01:38:58.032 --> 01:39:00.835 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY I MEAN THEY WERE THEY

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.469 region:rollup2
WERE BEING DISCUSSED BUT THEY

01:39:00.835 --> 01:39:02.670 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY WERE AT THE TOP OF THE

01:39:01.469 --> 01:39:04.906 region:rollup2
LIST.

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:06.007 region:rollup2
AND THAT FRUSTRATED ME.

01:39:04.906 --> 01:39:07.675 region:rollup2
THANK ONCE --

01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:09.343 region:rollup2
THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:11.179 region:rollup2
INVERSE CONDEMNATION FROM THE

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:13.147 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION --

01:39:11.179 --> 01:39:14.282 region:rollup2
WE SAW THAT IT THERE SEEM TO BE

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:15.850 region:rollup2
A PATHWAY FOR THE VICTIMS AND

01:39:14.282 --> 01:39:17.785 region:rollup2
THAT THAT PLEASED ME AND I THINK

01:39:15.850 --> 01:39:21.155 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT IS THE RIGHT

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:22.857 region:rollup2
THING THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:24.725 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT REPRESENT MY BOTTOM

01:39:22.857 --> 01:39:25.660 region:rollup2
LINE OR AS I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:28.663 region:rollup2
PRESS -- MY

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:30.798 region:rollup2
LINE IN THE SAND --

01:39:28.663 --> 01:39:32.767 region:rollup2
I THINK IT IS A CRITICALLY

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:35.069 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE

01:39:32.767 --> 01:39:36.304 region:rollup2
REGULATORY CHANGES TO FACILITATE

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:38.539 region:rollup2
FIRE PREVENTION.

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:40.241 region:rollup2
AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:43.144 region:rollup2
AND THE LANGUAGE IN THE PROPOSAL

01:39:40.241 --> 01:39:45.112 region:rollup2
IS CLOSE IN MANY WAYS.

01:39:43.144 --> 01:39:47.114 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE CAN GET THERE.

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:49.283 region:rollup2
BUT THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:51.886 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES A SINGLE WORD OR

01:39:49.283 --> 01:39:52.186 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE

01:39:51.886 --> 01:39:54.355 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:55.723 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:59.260 region:rollup2

01:40:06.133 --> 01:40:11.506 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ACRES.

01:40:08.436 --> 01:40:13.074 region:rollup2
NOW THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LARGER

01:40:11.506 --> 01:40:15.543 region:rollup2
THAN THE LAST PREVIOUS LARGE

01:40:13.074 --> 01:40:16.077 region:rollup2
FIRE WHICH WAS THE THOMAS FIRE

01:40:15.543 --> 01:40:20.081 region:rollup2
AND AND SENATOR JACKSON'S

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:21.048 region:rollup2

THOUSAND HOMES AND THAT FIRE IS

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:28.022 region:rollup2
STILL BURNING AND I DON'T

01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:28.289 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT'S FOR COMPLETELY

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:31.359 region:rollup2
CONTAINED.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:33.628 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY CLOSE.

01:40:31.359 --> 01:40:35.162 region:rollup2
CLEARLY WE HAVE AN ISSUE.

01:40:33.628 --> 01:40:36.464 region:rollup2
OVER A MILLION ACRES IS BURNT

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:39.033 region:rollup2

WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:43.204 region:rollup2
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HE AND I

01:40:41.569 --> 01:40:45.873 region:rollup2
FOR QUITE AWHILE.

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:47.341 region:rollup2
AND I WILL NEVER FORGET MY VERY

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:49.076 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:51.345 region:rollup2
LISTENING TO BRIAN ON THE VERY

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:54.248 region:rollup2

REALLY WORRIED ABOUT FIRE.

01:40:56.417 --> 01:40:58.619 region:rollup2
I CAN REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT HE

01:40:57.018 --> 01:40:59.487 region:rollup2
SAID.

01:40:58.619 --> 01:41:01.122 region:rollup2
BUT I DO REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED

01:40:59.487 --> 01:41:02.290 region:rollup2
THE NEXT DAY.

01:41:01.122 --> 01:41:04.592 region:rollup2
AND A MAJOR WILDFIRE BROKE OUT

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:06.394 region:rollup2
LAKE COUNTY.

01:41:04.592 --> 01:41:08.563 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WAS THE BEGINNING OF

01:41:06.394 --> 01:41:09.130 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN HERE.

01:41:08.563 --> 01:41:11.599 region:rollup2
THAT HAD THESE CATASTROPHIC

01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:14.201 region:rollup2
FIRES.

01:41:11.599 --> 01:41:16.637 region:rollup2
WE ABSOLUTELY NEED SIGNIFICANT

01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:19.774 region:rollup2
ONGOING FUNDING FOR PREVENTION

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:20.875 region:rollup2
AND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

01:41:19.774 --> 01:41:22.410 region:rollup2
A CURRENTLY THE LANGUAGE THAT'S

01:41:20.875 --> 01:41:23.911 region:rollup2
BEFORE US.

01:41:22.410 --> 01:41:25.780 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

01:41:23.911 --> 01:41:26.981 region:rollup2
NINETY MILLION DOLLARS.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.815 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN ASKING FOR THREE

01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:30.584 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I DIDN'T

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:31.819 region:rollup2
PULL THAT NUMBER OUT OF THE AIR.

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:33.654 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER CAME [inaudible]

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:35.222 region:rollup2
FROM.

01:41:33.654 --> 01:41:37.291 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:39.393 region:rollup2

I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE LIGHT.

01:41:41.162 --> 01:41:45.533 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS

01:41:42.663 --> 01:41:47.735 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED AS WELL.

01:41:45.533 --> 01:41:49.937 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING FOR LANGUAGE.

01:41:47.735 --> 01:41:52.740 region:rollup2

FOR LESS THAN THAT.

01:41:56.610 --> 01:42:00.281 region:rollup2
I WANT TO GUARANTEE WE DESERVE

01:41:58.245 --> 01:42:01.983 region:rollup2
THE GUARANTEE CALIFORNIA.

DESERVES A GUARANTEE TO THAT

01:42:01.983 --> 01:42:04.452 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOOD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

01:42:03.084 --> 01:42:07.021 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT PROPERTY AND MAKE

01:42:04.452 --> 01:42:08.456 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SAFE IN THE STATE.

01:42:07.021 --> 01:42:09.690 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS WE SHOULD ALSO BE

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.225 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING HOW ENSURE THAT OUR

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:14.261 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS.

01:42:11.225 --> 01:42:14.795 region:rollup2
HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE ASSETS.

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:16.797 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR

01:42:14.795 --> 01:42:18.699 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THE

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:19.266 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THEM.

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:21.602 region:rollup2
AND MAKE THEIR JOB SAFER AS

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:23.104 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:25.239 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN ROUND AND ROUND ABOUT

01:42:23.104 --> 01:42:27.842 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HOW WE LOOK AT THAT THE

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:29.243 region:rollup2
THE PAST FIRES AND YOU NO I BEEN

01:42:27.842 --> 01:42:30.911 region:rollup2
I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.512 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE RULES FOR TWO

01:42:30.911 --> 01:42:34.115 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IS THE

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:36.283 region:rollup2
RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:42:34.115 --> 01:42:37.818 region:rollup2
THIS THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US

01:42:36.283 --> 01:42:38.986 region:rollup2
TALKS ABOUT A VARIETY OF THINGS

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:41.956 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:43.424 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO --

01:42:41.956 --> 01:42:45.326 region:rollup2
TO BE CONSIDER FOR THE PC TO

01:42:43.424 --> 01:42:46.761 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY CONSIDER.

01:42:45.326 --> 01:42:49.797 region:rollup2
HOW THE LIABILITY MIGHT BE

01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:51.866 region:rollup2
PARCELED OUT IN THE FUTURE?

01:42:49.797 --> 01:42:52.400 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT

01:42:51.866 --> 01:42:52.833 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THAT

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.535 region:rollup2
DECISION.

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:56.404 region:rollup2
WORK DONE.

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:58.105 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND

01:42:56.404 --> 01:42:59.840 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THEIR WORK DONE.

01:42:58.105 --> 01:43:00.908 region:rollup2
AND I THINK I THINK I THINK THAT

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.043 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT A LOT

01:43:00.908 --> 01:43:02.643 region:rollup2
OF A HARDENING.

01:43:02.043 --> 01:43:06.447 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ASKING FOR SIMPLY

01:43:02.643 --> 01:43:08.249 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EXIST.

01:43:06.447 --> 01:43:09.984 region:rollup2
I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WE

01:43:08.249 --> 01:43:11.052 region:rollup2
NEED SOME SORT OF A TEST.

01:43:09.984 --> 01:43:14.121 region:rollup2
THEY MAKE SURE THAT SHAREHOLDERS

01:43:11.052 --> 01:43:16.290 region:rollup2
PAY FIRST.

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:18.059 region:rollup2
THAT RATE PAYER INCREASES THAT

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:19.460 region:rollup2
ARE NEEDED AFTER THAT BECAUSE I

01:43:18.059 --> 01:43:20.728 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING

01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.130 region:rollup2
TO BE ENOUGH MONEY --

01:43:20.728 --> 01:43:24.298 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE UTILITIES.

01:43:23.130 --> 01:43:27.134 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD FIND A WAY THAT WE

01:43:24.298 --> 01:43:28.869 region:rollup2
SECURE TIES THAT WAR OR SPREAD

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:30.838 region:rollup2
OUT SO THAT THE PAIN IS SMALL.

01:43:28.869 --> 01:43:32.139 region:rollup2
OVER A TWENTY YEAR PERIOD AND

01:43:30.838 --> 01:43:33.574 region:rollup2
I'D LOVE TO KNOW AT SOME POINT

01:43:32.139 --> 01:43:35.076 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS ON THAT WITH HOW

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:36.610 region:rollup2
THAT WORKS OUT.

01:43:35.076 --> 01:43:37.478 region:rollup2
BUT PART OF THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO

01:43:36.610 --> 01:43:38.713 region:rollup2
BE.

01:43:37.478 --> 01:43:40.114 region:rollup2
THAT WE PROTECT THE MOST

01:43:38.713 --> 01:43:41.615 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE PEOPLE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:43:40.114 --> 01:43:43.150 region:rollup2
CAN'T AFFORD THOSE ANY RATE

01:43:41.615 --> 01:43:46.053 region:rollup2
INCREASES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:43:43.150 --> 01:43:47.855 region:rollup2
FIGURE THAT GOING FORWARD.

01:43:46.053 --> 01:43:49.457 region:rollup2
I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT THE

01:43:47.855 --> 01:43:50.958 region:rollup2
PROCESS LAID OUT IN THIS IN THIS

01:43:49.457 --> 01:43:52.660 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT THAT LOOK THAT THAT

01:43:50.958 --> 01:43:54.195 region:rollup2
CONSIDERS OTHER ISSUES GOING

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:55.696 region:rollup2
FORWARD LIKE.

01:43:54.195 --> 01:43:56.964 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:43:55.696 --> 01:43:58.799 region:rollup2
LIKE NGUYEN LIKE HUMIDITY LIKE

01:43:56.964 --> 01:44:00.701 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE THINGS ABSOLUTELY

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:01.001 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.770 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:44:01.001 --> 01:44:04.438 region:rollup2
AFTER.

01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:07.808 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE GRID

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:08.776 region:rollup2
HARDENING WE NEED.

01:44:07.808 --> 01:44:10.211 region:rollup2
AND THAT GRID HARDENING

01:44:08.776 --> 01:44:12.379 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T.

01:44:10.211 --> 01:44:14.515 region:rollup2
WAIT UNTIL WE GO THROUGH A P.

01:44:12.379 --> 01:44:17.084 region:rollup2
YOU SEE RATE MAKING PROCESS THAT

01:44:14.515 --> 01:44:17.918 region:rollup2
SHOULD START RIGHT AWAY.

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.553 region:rollup2
AND NOT ONLY SHOULD START RIGHT

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:21.388 region:rollup2
AWAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:22.923 region:rollup2
THE MONEY THAT'S BEING COLLECTED

01:44:21.388 --> 01:44:24.525 region:rollup2
FROM RATEPAYERS TO DO THAT IS

01:44:22.923 --> 01:44:25.793 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SPENT A PROPERTY.

01:44:24.525 --> 01:44:27.862 region:rollup2
AND WE OUGHT AUDIT MAKE SURE

01:44:25.793 --> 01:44:29.697 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THAT HAPPENS.

01:44:27.862 --> 01:44:30.664 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW HOW WE GET TO THE

01:44:29.697 --> 01:44:34.401 region:rollup2
REST OF THIS YOU KNOW THROUGH IN

01:44:30.664 --> 01:44:36.937 region:rollup2

IN THIS IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.146 region:rollup2
TIME IS --

01:44:44.545 --> 01:44:46.981 region:rollup2

IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WORK BUT IT'S

01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:52.780 region:rollup2
BEEN IMPORTANT WORK AND ITS BEEN

01:45:50.344 --> 01:45:55.382 region:rollup2
COMMENTED ON THAT THIS IS

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:56.684 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHY WE COME HERE.

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:58.319 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE HAVE SPENT

01:45:56.684 --> 01:46:00.054 region:rollup2
COUNTLESS HOURS DISCUSSING AND

01:45:58.319 --> 01:46:05.659 region:rollup2
DELIBERATING.

01:46:00.054 --> 01:46:06.327 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES WITHIN ITS PURVIEW.

01:46:05.659 --> 01:46:07.261 region:rollup2
THE TOPICS OF LEAD TO A CRITICAL

01:46:06.327 --> 01:46:09.930 region:rollup2
QUESTION FOR THIS COMMITTEE.

01:46:07.261 --> 01:46:12.766 region:rollup2
WHAT IN THIS SITUATION IS THE

01:46:09.930 --> 01:46:14.501 region:rollup2
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE?

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:14.802 region:rollup2
IS OUR ROLE MOVING FORWARD

01:46:14.501 --> 01:46:18.038 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:20.007 region:rollup2
SAVE. FOR A BAILOUT A

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:20.841 region:rollup2
BUSINESSWOMAN HAVE ARGUABLY

01:46:20.007 --> 01:46:23.944 region:rollup2
MISMANAGED THEIR

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:26.680 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES. FOR ME THE

01:46:23.944 --> 01:46:28.549 region:rollup2
ANSWER IS NO.

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:30.150 region:rollup2
I'VE ALSO HEARD A DESIRE BY SOME

01:46:28.549 --> 01:46:32.853 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THE TWO THOUSAND

01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:33.320 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN WILDFIRES.

01:46:32.853 --> 01:46:36.090 region:rollup2
FRANKLY AS NOTED BY MY

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.458 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE.

01:46:36.090 --> 01:46:39.627 region:rollup2
THE REPORTS ON THESE FIRES HAVE

01:46:37.458 --> 01:46:41.128 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN COMPLETED.

01:46:39.627 --> 01:46:42.463 region:rollup2
TODAY WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT

01:46:41.128 --> 01:46:43.998 region:rollup2
OF FAULT FOR THE TWO THOUSAND

01:46:42.463 --> 01:46:45.566 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN FIRES.

01:46:43.998 --> 01:46:46.100 region:rollup2
NOR THE TOTAL COST AFTER

01:46:45.566 --> 01:46:51.505 region:rollup2
SETTLEMENTS PAYOUTS. TO BE

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:53.073 region:rollup2
CLEAR.

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:55.409 region:rollup2
WE MUST HOLD ACCOUNTABLE THOSE

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:59.446 region:rollup2
WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE.

01:46:55.409 --> 01:47:00.714 region:rollup2
WE WILL NOT ENGAGE IN A BAILOUT.

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:03.150 region:rollup2
BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT THOUGH IS

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:05.819 region:rollup2
OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATURE TO

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:07.521 region:rollup2
PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SECURITY

01:47:05.819 --> 01:47:10.190 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:11.892 region:rollup2
AND ALL CALIFORNIANS.

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:12.893 region:rollup2
AND THIS HAS BEEN JEOPARDIZED

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:14.128 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE DEVASTATION

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:18.399 region:rollup2
CAUSED.

01:47:14.128 --> 01:47:19.199 region:rollup2
BY THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

01:47:18.399 --> 01:47:21.635 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE STATISTICS AND I

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:23.037 region:rollup2
THINK.

01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:25.372 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO REMEMBER THESE WE

01:47:23.037 --> 01:47:28.442 region:rollup2
NEED TO IT WHAT WE NEED TO PUT

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:30.711 region:rollup2
THIS ALL INTO PERSPECTIVE.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:31.679 region:rollup2
OR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ONE OF

01:47:30.711 --> 01:47:33.681 region:rollup2
THE STATISTICS SHOWS THAT THE

01:47:31.679 --> 01:47:36.116 region:rollup2
COST HAS BEEN OVER THIRTEEN

01:47:33.681 --> 01:47:38.085 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:47:36.116 --> 01:47:41.889 region:rollup2
THERE'VE BEEN A TOTAL OF OVER

01:47:38.085 --> 01:47:45.726 region:rollup2
NINE THOUSAND FIRES. FIVE

01:47:41.889 --> 01:47:47.928 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HOMES BURNED. FORTY ONE

01:47:45.726 --> 01:47:49.930 region:rollup2
DEATHS [inaudible]

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.831 region:rollup2
CIVILIAN DEATHS.

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:53.567 region:rollup2
PLUS TWO FIREFIGHTERS LOST THEIR

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:55.936 region:rollup2
LIVES.

01:47:53.567 --> 01:47:56.570 region:rollup2
NON FATAL INJURIES INCLUDE

01:47:55.936 --> 01:47:57.905 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE

01:47:56.570 --> 01:48:04.311 region:rollup2
CIVILIANS AND TWELVE

01:47:57.905 --> 01:48:06.280 region:rollup2
FIREFIGHTERS.

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:10.050 region:rollup2
THERE'S MUCH THAT WE NEED TO DO.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:12.886 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING.

01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:14.621 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED.

01:48:12.886 --> 01:48:16.657 region:rollup2
I HAVE SAID FROM THE VERY

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:18.392 region:rollup2
BEGINNING THE NUMBER ONE THING

01:48:16.657 --> 01:48:20.260 region:rollup2
THAT I WANT TO DEAL WITH IS

01:48:18.392 --> 01:48:22.563 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT ARE VICTIMS ARE

01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:23.630 region:rollup2
MADE WHOLE.

01:48:22.563 --> 01:48:24.932 region:rollup2
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE SAFETY

01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:26.700 region:rollup2
AND PROTECTION [inaudible]

01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:28.736 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE [inaudible]

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:31.171 region:rollup2

IN THE FUTURE.

01:49:31.999 --> 01:49:37.871 region:rollup2

01:50:42.503 --> 01:50:46.473 region:rollup2
FIRST ROUND TODAY --

01:50:44.505 --> 01:50:47.941 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:50.511 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION AND

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:52.646 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY.

01:50:50.511 --> 01:50:55.115 region:rollup2
A I ACTUALLY YESTERDAY SAT DOWN

HE GOT WRENCHING FOUR PAGE

01:50:56.049 --> 01:51:01.188 region:rollup2
LETTER.

01:50:57.718 --> 01:51:01.755 region:rollup2
FROM A WOMAN IN MY DISTRICT --

01:51:01.188 --> 01:51:04.124 region:rollup2
WHO LOST HER HUSBAND AND HER

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:06.693 region:rollup2
SON?

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:07.995 region:rollup2
IN THE DEBRIS FLOW AND TERM HER

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:09.830 region:rollup2
SON'S SOME BODY IS YET TO BE

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:11.765 region:rollup2
FOUND.

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:14.101 region:rollup2
AND THE FACT THAT BOTH SHE AND

01:51:11.765 --> 01:51:15.469 region:rollup2
HER SURVIVING DAUGHTER.

01:51:14.101 --> 01:51:17.905 region:rollup2
ALONG WITH THE HUSBAND IN THE

01:51:15.469 --> 01:51:20.307 region:rollup2
SUN WERE BLOWN OUT OF THEIR HOME

01:51:17.905 --> 01:51:24.077 region:rollup2
LITERALLY IS THE HILLSIDE ABOVE

01:51:20.307 --> 01:51:25.646 region:rollup2
MACHITO HOME CAME DOWN --

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:28.448 region:rollup2
THEY LOST THEIR DOGS WELL.

01:51:25.646 --> 01:51:29.983 region:rollup2
AND THE TRAUMA I DON'T KNOW IF

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:32.486 region:rollup2
ANY OF YOU SAW BUT THERE WERE

01:51:29.983 --> 01:51:34.288 region:rollup2
PHOTOS AND A SCENARIO OF A

01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:35.355 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL THAT THEY

01:51:34.288 --> 01:51:37.658 region:rollup2
I RECOVERED.

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:38.825 region:rollup2
AYE IN THAT TO BRIEF LOW WHO

01:51:37.658 --> 01:51:40.861 region:rollup2
JUST ABOUT DROWNED BUT

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:41.828 region:rollup2
MIRACULOUSLY FOUND A POCKET OF

01:51:40.861 --> 01:51:43.864 region:rollup2
AIR.

01:51:41.828 --> 01:51:45.399 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAS HER DAUGHTER.

01:51:43.864 --> 01:51:47.834 region:rollup2
AND SHE HERSELF WAS HOSPITALIZED

01:51:45.399 --> 01:51:49.670 region:rollup2
FOR THREE WEEKS --

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:51.204 region:rollup2
AND BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM THE

01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:52.706 region:rollup2
SCARS ARE SO DEEP.

01:51:51.204 --> 01:51:54.508 region:rollup2
THAT SHE'S HAD TO QUIT HER HER

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:56.176 region:rollup2
JOB.

01:51:54.508 --> 01:51:58.145 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FOR DAUGHTER IS SO

01:51:56.176 --> 01:51:59.746 region:rollup2
TRAUMATIZED THAT SHE LITERALLY

01:51:58.145 --> 01:52:01.048 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE LEFT ALONE.

01:51:59.746 --> 01:52:02.416 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR SHARE THIS WITH YOU

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:04.618 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CANNOT FORGET THE

01:52:02.416 --> 01:52:07.020 region:rollup2
HUMAN ELEMENT OF WHAT HAPPENS.

01:52:04.618 --> 01:52:08.088 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LOSE THEIR LOVED

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:10.290 region:rollup2
ONES AND I WON'T EVEN GO INTO

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:12.059 region:rollup2
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY FAMILY

01:52:10.290 --> 01:52:13.560 region:rollup2
THIS WAS --

01:52:12.059 --> 01:52:16.063 region:rollup2
SO I LOOK AT THIS FROM THEIR

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.464 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I KNOW WE ALSO NEED

01:52:16.063 --> 01:52:18.832 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT IT --

01:52:17.464 --> 01:52:20.400 region:rollup2
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF KEEPING

01:52:18.832 --> 01:52:22.302 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY GOING KEEPING THE

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.836 region:rollup2
LIGHTS ON KEEPING PEOPLE WORKING

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:24.271 region:rollup2
IN.

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:25.739 region:rollup2
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY

01:52:24.271 --> 01:52:29.243 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN VERY --

01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:30.510 region:rollup2
IMPORTANTLY REFERENCED HERE BUT

01:52:29.243 --> 01:52:32.212 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY ARE IN MANY

01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:34.648 region:rollup2
RESPECTS ABOUT THE SAFETY IN THE

01:52:32.212 --> 01:52:35.983 region:rollup2
FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA --

01:52:34.648 --> 01:52:37.417 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FIRES HAVE BEEN BURNING

01:52:35.983 --> 01:52:39.486 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO BURN ALL OVER

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:40.587 region:rollup2
THE STATE IN THE RURAL AREAS IN

01:52:39.486 --> 01:52:44.024 region:rollup2
THE URBAN AREAS [inaudible]

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:47.227 region:rollup2
FROM FROM BEVERLY HILLS TO

01:52:44.024 --> 01:52:48.996 region:rollup2
TAMANA SETO INVENTOR AND TO THE

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:50.664 region:rollup2
SANTA ROSA AND LAKE COUNTY IN

01:52:48.996 --> 01:52:52.165 region:rollup2
AYE EVERYWHERE DOWN TO SAN DIEGO

01:52:50.664 --> 01:52:53.634 region:rollup2
SO.

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:55.369 region:rollup2
WE DO HAVE A AN ENORMOUS

01:52:53.634 --> 01:52:57.137 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK WE

01:52:55.369 --> 01:52:59.106 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW A A PRETTY GOOD JOB

01:52:57.137 --> 01:53:00.741 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES

01:52:59.106 --> 01:53:04.278 region:rollup2
I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH

01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:05.545 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE APPROACHES.

01:53:04.278 --> 01:53:07.114 region:rollup2
TO TO GETTING RID OF SOME OF THE

01:53:05.545 --> 01:53:08.348 region:rollup2
TREASON AND THINGS THAT ARE

01:53:07.114 --> 01:53:09.683 region:rollup2
GOING ON BUT I THINK THAT

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WE CAN COME TO SOME

01:53:09.683 --> 01:53:14.288 region:rollup2
KIND OF COMPROMISE NOBODY IS

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.656 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE REALLY HAPPY THIS IS

01:53:14.288 --> 01:53:17.791 region:rollup2
NOT A HAPPY SITUATION.

01:53:15.656 --> 01:53:19.559 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:21.228 region:rollup2
GETTING EXCITED AND CELEBRATING

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:23.096 region:rollup2
WITH GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE WE'RE

01:53:21.228 --> 01:53:24.398 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PROTECTING.

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:26.600 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE OF OUR OF OUR

01:53:24.398 --> 01:53:28.902 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SO --

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:31.672 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

01:53:28.902 --> 01:53:34.875 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE --

01:53:31.672 --> 01:53:34.875 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:38.378 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK THE ISSUE THE ONE

01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:40.380 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUE OUT STANDING IN AND

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:41.815 region:rollup2
I AGREE WITH THIS AS I DON'T

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:44.918 region:rollup2
WANT TO REWARD OR LET.

01:53:41.815 --> 01:53:46.887 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:47.521 region:rollup2
DOING LESS THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD

01:53:46.887 --> 01:53:50.123 region:rollup2
BE DOING YOU KNOW OUR UTILITIES

01:53:47.521 --> 01:53:51.291 region:rollup2

THEIR MONOPOLY WE HAVE GIVEN

01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:03.403 region:rollup2
THEM THAT ABILITY AND I THINK

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:05.238 region:rollup2
MANY OF US ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED

01:54:03.403 --> 01:54:06.940 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVEN'T NECESSARILY

01:54:05.238 --> 01:54:10.410 region:rollup2
TAKE IN THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:11.945 region:rollup2
A CAREFULLY AND ARE HONESTLY.

01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:13.947 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER HAND WE NEED THOSE

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:15.415 region:rollup2
COMPANIES ARE WE NEED SOME FORM

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:17.117 region:rollup2
OF COMPANY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE

THE ELECTRICITY THAT IS

01:54:17.117 --> 01:54:20.187 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTAL TO THE STATE.

01:54:18.552 --> 01:54:22.122 region:rollup2
AND TO OUR EXISTENCE AT THIS

01:54:20.187 --> 01:54:24.057 region:rollup2
POINT TIME AS WE BEGIN HELL ARE

SO DEPENDENT UPON IT.

01:54:24.057 --> 01:54:26.793 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS TO ME ONE OF THE

01:54:25.492 --> 01:54:28.895 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS.

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:29.496 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE?

01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:32.666 region:rollup2
ARE SURE THAT THAT ELECTRICITY

01:54:29.496 --> 01:54:34.768 region:rollup2

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:47.981 region:rollup2
A THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY

01:54:45.378 --> 01:54:49.483 region:rollup2
THAT IS GOING TO LIMIT TO THE

01:54:47.981 --> 01:54:51.118 region:rollup2
EXTENT HUMANLY POSSIBLE THESE

01:54:49.483 --> 01:54:53.854 region:rollup2
EVENTS WHERE I HAVE TO READ

01:54:51.118 --> 01:54:56.523 region:rollup2
ABOUT MY CONSTITUENTS WHO.

01:54:53.854 --> 01:54:57.491 region:rollup2
LOST THEIR LIVES MY MY M.

01:54:56.523 --> 01:54:59.526 region:rollup2
GRANDDAUGHTER --

01:54:57.491 --> 01:55:00.761 region:rollup2
WAS IN CLASS WITH THIS YOUNG MAN

01:54:59.526 --> 01:55:01.928 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE LEFT HIS SEAT

01:55:00.761 --> 01:55:04.564 region:rollup2
VACANT.

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:07.601 region:rollup2
I IN HIS MEMORY --

01:55:04.564 --> 01:55:09.603 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST YEAR --

01:55:07.601 --> 01:55:11.371 region:rollup2
WE ARE A STATE OF PEOPLE.

01:55:09.603 --> 01:55:11.905 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK OUR FIRST

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:13.840 region:rollup2
PRIORITY HAS TO BE TO OUR

01:55:11.905 --> 01:55:15.308 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:17.344 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS

01:55:15.308 --> 01:55:19.546 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF HOW ARE WE GOING TO

01:55:17.344 --> 01:55:21.314 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED

01:55:19.546 --> 01:55:23.383 region:rollup2
WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:25.185 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THE COSTS AND THE

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:26.486 region:rollup2
LIABILITIES.

01:55:25.185 --> 01:55:29.189 region:rollup2
FOR A IN THAT BET PARTICULARLY

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:30.457 region:rollup2
PGN IN I WOULD POSIT THAT EDISON

01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:31.525 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE LIABILITY IN MY

01:55:30.457 --> 01:55:31.958 region:rollup2
DISTRICT FOR THE FIRES THAT

01:55:31.525 --> 01:55:33.827 region:rollup2
OCCURRED [inaudible]

01:55:31.958 --> 01:55:35.328 region:rollup2
SO.

01:55:33.827 --> 01:55:38.265 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO ASK THE COURT WE HAVE

01:55:35.328 --> 01:55:40.400 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO. TO

01:55:38.265 --> 01:55:42.235 region:rollup2
TAKE WHAT WE CAN FROM THE

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.171 region:rollup2
COMPANIES THAT HAVE PROFITED BY

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:46.139 region:rollup2
THEIR PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOR.

01:55:44.171 --> 01:55:47.007 region:rollup2
BY THEIR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE

01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:49.643 region:rollup2
HUGE PROFITS IT --

01:55:47.007 --> 01:55:54.881 region:rollup2
ARE SHOULD SAVE --

01:55:49.643 --> 01:55:56.983 region:rollup2
GIVE BONUSES TO THEIR CEO'S --

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:59.386 region:rollup2
FOR THE PROFITS THEY HAVE

01:55:56.983 --> 01:56:01.521 region:rollup2
INCURRED A IN RECEIVED AT THE AT

01:55:59.386 --> 01:56:03.657 region:rollup2
THE EXPENSE OF CLEARING OUT

01:56:01.521 --> 01:56:04.057 region:rollup2
THERE AREAS IN DOING THINGS THAT

01:56:03.657 --> 01:56:05.826 region:rollup2
WOULD HARDEN THEIR

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:08.128 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:56:05.826 --> 01:56:10.197 region:rollup2
YET AT THE SAME TIME OUGHT NOT

01:56:08.128 --> 01:56:11.731 region:rollup2
IMPACTING THE REPAIRS TO THE

01:56:10.197 --> 01:56:13.667 region:rollup2
EXTENT WE CAN AVOID THAT.

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:15.068 region:rollup2
AND YET WHAT I'M HEARING IN I

01:56:13.667 --> 01:56:16.770 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TRUE AND I

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:18.271 region:rollup2
WANNA SEE THE NUMBERS.

01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:19.973 region:rollup2
WE HERE FROM PEACHY NEITHER

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:22.776 region:rollup2
THREATS OF GOING BANKRUPT ARE

01:56:19.973 --> 01:56:24.811 region:rollup2
HAVING THEIR THAT CREDIT RATING

01:56:22.776 --> 01:56:26.413 region:rollup2
REDUCE THAT MAY BE TRUE --

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:29.549 region:rollup2
I WANT TO SEE THE NUMBERS

01:56:26.413 --> 01:56:30.116 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I'M NOT SURE I'M

01:56:29.549 --> 01:56:32.819 region:rollup2
CONVINCED THAT PEACHY ISN'T

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:33.820 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:56:32.819 --> 01:56:35.789 region:rollup2
THE A PRECIPICE OF BANKRUPTCY

01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:36.389 region:rollup2
THEY'VE MADE WHAT WAS A FOUR

01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:37.891 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:39.593 region:rollup2
IN PROFITS OVER THE FIRST

01:56:37.891 --> 01:56:40.994 region:rollup2
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR THEY

01:56:39.593 --> 01:56:41.461 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO DO WELL AND THAT'S

01:56:40.994 --> 01:56:44.097 region:rollup2
JUST FINE [inaudible]

01:56:41.461 --> 01:56:46.600 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE PROFITS HAVE TO COME

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:49.135 region:rollup2
BACK.

01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.737 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO AYE I GUESS SO

01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:52.806 region:rollup2
THE SENATOR DODD REFERS TO IT AS

01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:53.907 region:rollup2
A SCRUB MEANING TAKE THOSE

01:56:52.806 --> 01:56:56.076 region:rollup2
PROFITS.

01:56:53.907 --> 01:56:56.543 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO USE THOSE PROFITS

01:56:56.076 --> 01:56:59.646 region:rollup2
TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE

01:56:56.543 --> 01:57:00.914 region:rollup2
MISGUIDED.

01:56:59.646 --> 01:57:02.682 region:rollup2
PROFIT DRIVEN MOTIVES THAT HAVE

01:57:00.914 --> 01:57:05.819 region:rollup2
CAUSED.

01:57:02.682 --> 01:57:07.988 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF US. TO TO HAVE TO

01:57:05.819 --> 01:57:10.357 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH THE THE TRAGEDY IN OUR

01:57:07.988 --> 01:57:12.392 region:rollup2
DISTRICT AND AND THE IMPACT IT'S

01:57:10.357 --> 01:57:13.927 region:rollup2
HAD ON OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:57:12.392 --> 01:57:15.662 region:rollup2
AND SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

01:57:13.927 --> 01:57:18.398 region:rollup2
DOING THAT.

01:57:15.662 --> 01:57:19.966 region:rollup2
THE PROFITS HAVE TO COME BACK.

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:21.835 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WELL.

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:23.103 region:rollup2
IS IT SUFFICIENT.

01:57:21.835 --> 01:57:23.803 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHEN WE GET INTO

01:57:23.103 --> 01:57:25.872 region:rollup2
THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF

01:57:23.803 --> 01:57:27.841 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION.

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:29.476 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU SECURITIZED WHO ARE

01:57:27.841 --> 01:57:30.477 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO PAY FOR

01:57:29.476 --> 01:57:32.412 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S THE SURE IT'S THE

01:57:30.477 --> 01:57:34.581 region:rollup2
RIGHT PAYER.

01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:37.384 region:rollup2
AND I ASK WELL WHO ELSE.

01:57:34.581 --> 01:57:39.019 region:rollup2
COULD WE LOOK TO FOR THIS.

01:57:37.384 --> 01:57:40.253 region:rollup2
AND I AND I'M NOT SURE DETERGENT

01:57:39.019 --> 01:57:42.756 region:rollup2
ANSWER [inaudible]

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:43.890 region:rollup2
SOME.

01:57:42.756 --> 01:57:45.458 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO GET THAT

01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:47.627 region:rollup2
MONEY BACK FROM THE CEOS AND

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:49.195 region:rollup2
OTHERS WHO CAVALIERLY FELT THAT

01:57:47.627 --> 01:57:50.697 region:rollup2
THEY WERE ENTITLED TO ALL THESE

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:51.932 region:rollup2
BONUSES.

01:57:50.697 --> 01:57:53.266 region:rollup2
FOR ESSENTIALLY --

01:57:51.932 --> 01:57:55.502 region:rollup2
MAKING ALL THIS MONEY AT THE

01:57:53.266 --> 01:57:56.703 region:rollup2
EXPENSE OF OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I

01:57:55.502 --> 01:57:58.572 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT CERTAINLY ISN'T

01:57:56.703 --> 01:58:01.107 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE ENOUGH.

01:57:58.572 --> 01:58:02.042 region:rollup2
SO I THINK --

01:58:01.107 --> 01:58:04.077 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LOOK TO THE P. YOU

01:58:02.042 --> 01:58:05.545 region:rollup2
SEE.

01:58:04.077 --> 01:58:07.514 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A ROLE HERE WHETHER WE

01:58:05.545 --> 01:58:09.082 region:rollup2
LIKE IT OR NOT THEY TO HAVE A

01:58:07.514 --> 01:58:10.483 region:rollup2
RULE -- I

01:58:09.082 --> 01:58:13.186 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:13.987 region:rollup2
THEY DO WHAT THEIR SUPPOSED TO

01:58:13.186 --> 01:58:15.388 region:rollup2
DO.

01:58:13.987 --> 01:58:18.224 region:rollup2
AND AND LOOK AT THE VARIOUS

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:20.126 region:rollup2
FACTORS AND I FOR ONE AM NOT

01:58:18.224 --> 01:58:21.861 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY EXCITED ABOUT

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:22.162 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE RULES NOW

01:58:21.861 --> 01:58:23.663 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

01:58:22.162 --> 01:58:26.099 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY.

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:27.601 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO APPLY

01:58:26.099 --> 01:58:29.169 region:rollup2
THE SAME STANDARD SHOULD THEY

01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:30.403 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN APPLYING PERHAPS GOING

01:58:29.169 --> 01:58:32.706 region:rollup2
FORWARD WE CAN HELP GIVE THEM

01:58:30.403 --> 01:58:34.374 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE.

01:58:32.706 --> 01:58:36.543 region:rollup2
BUT RIGHT NOW WE GOT TO DO THEIR

01:58:34.374 --> 01:58:38.745 region:rollup2
JOB THEY GOTTA STEP UP.

01:58:36.543 --> 01:58:41.915 region:rollup2
AND I THINK ARE WE NEED TO SEND

01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:44.117 region:rollup2
THE SIGNAL TO THE MARKETS --

01:58:41.915 --> 01:58:45.685 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE SERIOUS.

01:58:44.117 --> 01:58:46.920 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOLDING THESE COMPANIES

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:48.555 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE WHILE AT THE SAME

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:51.257 region:rollup2
TIME RECOGNIZING THAT WE NEED

01:58:48.555 --> 01:58:53.093 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY.

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:54.594 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE NEED --

01:58:53.093 --> 01:58:56.029 region:rollup2
TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACTS OF

01:58:54.594 --> 01:58:58.331 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT NOT AS AN

01:58:56.029 --> 01:58:59.1000 region:rollup2
EXCUSE AND I THINK THIS IS WHERE

01:58:58.331 --> 01:59:01.034 region:rollup2
SOME OF US HAVE A CONCERN.

01:58:59.1000 --> 01:59:02.802 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALL KNOWN CLIMATE CHANGE

01:59:01.034 --> 01:59:05.005 region:rollup2
WAS HAPPENING.

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:06.806 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS HAD IMPACTS

01:59:05.005 --> 01:59:08.508 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD NOT BE AN EXCUSE BUT A

01:59:06.806 --> 01:59:10.410 region:rollup2
MOTIVATION [inaudible]

01:59:08.508 --> 01:59:11.244 region:rollup2
A MOTIVATION.

01:59:10.410 --> 01:59:13.179 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO BE FACTORED IN BY

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:14.581 region:rollup2
THESE UTILITIES.

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:16.082 region:rollup2
THE CANCER ALL WELL CLIMATE

01:59:14.581 --> 01:59:17.650 region:rollup2
CHANGES HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM SO

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:18.918 region:rollup2
THEREFORE YOU KNOW DON'T HOLD US

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:20.220 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE.

01:59:18.918 --> 01:59:21.621 region:rollup2
NO YOU HAVE TO FACTOR CLIMATE

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.156 region:rollup2
CHANGE INTO THE WORK YOU'RE

01:59:21.621 --> 01:59:23.923 region:rollup2
DOING YOU HAVE TO HARDEN THAT

01:59:23.156 --> 01:59:25.759 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'VE GOTTA BE

01:59:23.923 --> 01:59:27.093 region:rollup2
OUT THERE TAKING A LOOK AT THE

01:59:25.759 --> 01:59:29.095 region:rollup2
LIMBS OF TREES.

01:59:27.093 --> 01:59:29.963 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BLOW IT IN EIGHTY

01:59:29.095 --> 01:59:31.264 region:rollup2
FIVE HUNDRED MILE AN HOUR WIND

01:59:29.963 --> 01:59:32.732 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HAVING

01:59:31.264 --> 01:59:34.300 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE YOU A PASS

01:59:32.732 --> 01:59:35.635 region:rollup2
FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT'S PART

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:37.170 region:rollup2
OF WHAT MANY OF US.

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:38.905 region:rollup2
ARE FEELING THE FRUSTRATION IN

01:59:37.170 --> 01:59:40.540 region:rollup2
THE HUNDREDS OF LETTERS THAT

01:59:38.905 --> 01:59:42.642 region:rollup2
MANY OF US I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN

01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:44.244 region:rollup2
GETTING A FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:59:42.642 --> 01:59:45.678 region:rollup2
ARE VICTIMS NEED TO BE MADE

01:59:44.244 --> 01:59:47.881 region:rollup2
WHOLE [inaudible]

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:49.182 region:rollup2
OUR RATEPAYERS SHOULDN'T TAKE

01:59:47.881 --> 01:59:51.885 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITY THE BIGGEST

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:53.019 region:rollup2
HIT FOR THIS THE SHAREHOLDERS

01:59:51.885 --> 01:59:56.289 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:58.358 region:rollup2
SO. FOR ME I THINK WE'VE DONE A

01:59:56.289 --> 01:59:59.693 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB AND I THINK WE CAN GET

01:59:58.358 --> 02:00:01.761 region:rollup2
THERE WHEN IT COMES TO THE IT

01:59:59.693 --> 02:00:03.496 region:rollup2
COULD ENVIRONMENTAL ECOLOGICALLY

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:04.831 region:rollup2
SOUND APPROACH WE MAY HAVE SOME

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:07.667 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES BUT I THINK WE CAN

02:00:04.831 --> 02:00:09.402 region:rollup2
COMPROMISE AT IN INCOME OUT WAS

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:10.370 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH.

02:00:09.402 --> 02:00:12.672 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE ISSUE IS THE

02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:14.074 region:rollup2
SECURITIZATION ISSUE THIS IS THE

02:00:12.672 --> 02:00:16.409 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH THE P. YOU SEE.

02:00:14.074 --> 02:00:17.811 region:rollup2
AND I FOR ONE DON'T WANT TO GIVE

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:19.946 region:rollup2
A PASS TO THESE COMPANIES

02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:21.448 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY I DON'T GIVE A

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:22.916 region:rollup2
PASSED TO THEM GOING FORWARD BUT

02:00:21.448 --> 02:00:23.783 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO SET UP SOME

02:00:22.916 --> 02:00:25.285 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES.

02:00:23.783 --> 02:00:26.653 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE FRAMEWORK I

02:00:25.285 --> 02:00:28.154 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO SEE US ALL OVER

02:00:26.653 --> 02:00:29.255 region:rollup2
THE NEXT.

02:00:28.154 --> 02:00:31.057 region:rollup2
I PROBABLY TALKED FOR A FULL

02:00:29.255 --> 02:00:33.159 region:rollup2
HOUR SO THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE

02:00:31.057 --> 02:00:34.761 region:rollup2
HOURS THAT ARE LEFT SO THAT WE

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:36.296 region:rollup2
CAN MOVE FORWARD --

02:00:34.761 --> 02:00:38.731 region:rollup2
BUT HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE WHO

02:00:36.296 --> 02:00:40.333 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE PROTECT THE VICTIMS

02:00:38.731 --> 02:00:41.801 region:rollup2
THE RATEPAYERS TO THE EXTENT WE

02:00:40.333 --> 02:00:42.936 region:rollup2

02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:44.404 region:rollup2
CLOSE.

02:00:42.936 --> 02:00:47.507 region:rollup2
AND SO I HOPE THAT OVER THE NEXT

02:00:44.404 --> 02:00:48.608 region:rollup2
FEW HOURS WE CAN SUSPEND.

02:00:47.507 --> 02:00:50.744 region:rollup2
THAT'S SORT OF ARE

02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:52.745 region:rollup2
INTRACTABILITY WE SOMETIMES FEEL

02:00:50.744 --> 02:00:54.981 region:rollup2

INDEPENDENT AUDIT --

02:01:24.711 --> 02:01:28.214 region:rollup2
OF P. GENIE WOULD BE NECESSARY

02:01:25.311 --> 02:01:29.949 region:rollup2
--

02:01:28.214 --> 02:01:31.251 region:rollup2
TO TAKE THE MAXIMUM OUT THAT

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:32.585 region:rollup2
THEY COULD ABSORB [inaudible]

02:01:31.251 --> 02:01:35.321 region:rollup2
BEFORE [inaudible]

I YOU KNOW.

02:01:35.321 --> 02:01:38.458 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE DOWNGRADES --

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:40.160 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD REALLY IMPACT THEIR

02:01:38.458 --> 02:01:42.328 region:rollup2
RATE PAYERS BEFORE --

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:44.297 region:rollup2

02:01:51.104 --> 02:01:54.574 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NOT.

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:55.375 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS THIS DISCUSSION

02:01:54.574 --> 02:01:57.043 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY I THINK IS VERY VERY

02:01:55.375 --> 02:01:58.411 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:01:57.043 --> 02:02:00.180 region:rollup2
AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:02.115 region:rollup2
MONEY MANAGERS.

02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:04.083 region:rollup2

ABOUT BAILOUTS.

02:02:12.225 --> 02:02:14.828 region:rollup2
IT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT THEY

02:02:13.593 --> 02:02:16.996 region:rollup2
WANT THE STOCK TO CONTINUE

02:02:14.828 --> 02:02:19.232 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WANT LATER THIS

02:02:16.996 --> 02:02:20.200 region:rollup2
WEEK THEY HAVE A DOWNGRADE AGAIN

02:02:19.232 --> 02:02:20.833 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THEIR

02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.770 region:rollup2
GIMME PROFITING BY ANY DOWNGRADE

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:26.439 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY THERE BOTH SAYING THE

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:34.447 region:rollup2
SAME THING THEY AGREE WITH

02:02:33.246 --> 02:02:35.648 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THEY

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:37.717 region:rollup2
AGREE THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE

02:02:35.648 --> 02:02:39.719 region:rollup2
IN A BET.

02:02:37.717 --> 02:02:43.656 region:rollup2
SO THE CONVERSATION UP HERE.

02:02:39.719 --> 02:02:44.190 region:rollup2
HAS TO BE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:46.192 region:rollup2
THAT THAT YOU BET DOESN'T

02:02:44.190 --> 02:02:47.894 region:rollup2

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:50.296 region:rollup2
IT I AM JUST SO FUHRMAN THAT

02:02:47.894 --> 02:02:51.831 region:rollup2
AFTER TALKING TO THESE --

02:02:50.296 --> 02:02:53.833 region:rollup2
HAD THE THESE PEOPLE IT IT'S

02:02:51.831 --> 02:02:55.068 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF P.

JEANNIE GOES BANKRUPT.

02:02:55.068 --> 02:02:59.138 region:rollup2
LET ME TELL YOU.

02:02:56.736 --> 02:03:01.708 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE FAMILIES FORTIES FORTY

SIX PEOPLE THAT DIED.

02:03:01.708 --> 02:03:07.213 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME PERIOD.

02:03:04.210 --> 02:03:09.115 region:rollup2
THE FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND HOUSES

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:12.318 region:rollup2
AND BUSINESSES.

02:03:09.115 --> 02:03:14.020 region:rollup2
THAT DEAD BIRD OF THE GROUT.

02:03:12.318 --> 02:03:14.954 region:rollup2
WE KEPT THE INVERSE COMBINATION

02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:16.055 region:rollup2
IN PLAY AND I'M TOTALLY OKAY

02:03:14.954 --> 02:03:17.824 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:18.558 region:rollup2
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY.

02:03:17.824 --> 02:03:20.860 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS THE

02:03:18.558 --> 02:03:22.161 region:rollup2
VICTIMS

02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:24.797 region:rollup2
ARE GONNA GET BRUTALIZE COULD BE

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:27.267 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZED AGAIN IF WE DON'T DO

02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:28.067 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:03:27.267 --> 02:03:29.903 region:rollup2
DO.

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:30.403 region:rollup2
THAT WE DO WHAT I SAID AT THE AT

02:03:29.903 --> 02:03:31.671 region:rollup2
THE UP AT THE TOP OF MY

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:32.639 region:rollup2
COMMENTS.

02:03:31.671 --> 02:03:34.274 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS AND

02:03:32.639 --> 02:03:35.575 region:rollup2
NOT TO REPEAT THEM BUT THE LAST

02:03:34.274 --> 02:03:37.243 region:rollup2
ONE WAS MAKE SURE THAT WE ASK

02:03:35.575 --> 02:03:39.245 region:rollup2
FISCALLY SOLVENT.

02:03:37.243 --> 02:03:41.080 region:rollup2
UTILITIES IT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:03:39.245 --> 02:03:42.882 region:rollup2
PARAMOUNT.

02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:44.951 region:rollup2
IN MOVING FORWARD.

02:03:42.882 --> 02:03:46.219 region:rollup2
BUT YOU KNOW.

02:03:44.951 --> 02:03:47.720 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA GIVE A COUPLE

02:03:46.219 --> 02:03:49.522 region:rollup2
THINGS LIKE MICHAEL PICKER SAT

02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:51.124 region:rollup2
HERE IN FRONT OF US AND SAID I

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:52.592 region:rollup2
CAN ASSURE YOU BECAUSE WE'VE

02:03:51.124 --> 02:03:53.927 region:rollup2
AUDITED P. GENIES BOOKS.

02:03:52.592 --> 02:03:55.928 region:rollup2
IT I DON'T EVEN LIKE BE IN A

02:03:53.927 --> 02:03:56.996 region:rollup2
POSITION WHERE I DEFEND THE PGD

02:03:55.928 --> 02:03:59.165 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY.

02:03:56.996 --> 02:03:59.766 region:rollup2
SINCE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:00.600 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DID MAKE A LOT OF

02:03:59.766 --> 02:04:02.035 region:rollup2
MISTAKES.

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.203 region:rollup2
WHEN HE OPINED?

02:04:02.035 --> 02:04:05.838 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY

02:04:04.203 --> 02:04:07.173 region:rollup2
DID THE HARDENING.

02:04:05.838 --> 02:04:09.375 region:rollup2
THAT THEY WERE PAID TO DO THAT'S

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:11.411 region:rollup2
WE TOLD US RIGHT THERE.

02:04:09.375 --> 02:04:13.479 region:rollup2
SO I I'M A LITTLE BIT CONFUSE

02:04:11.411 --> 02:04:16.949 region:rollup2
WHAT I HEAR SOME OF THESE THINGS

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:20.687 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:22.088 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT.

02:04:20.687 --> 02:04:22.989 region:rollup2
WE PROJECTED IT FOR THOSE OF YOU

02:04:22.088 --> 02:04:24.223 region:rollup2
DIDN'T GET THEY THE PRESS

02:04:22.989 --> 02:04:25.625 region:rollup2
DEMOCRAT THEY'RE OUT OF SANTA

02:04:24.223 --> 02:04:27.493 region:rollup2
ROSA.

02:04:25.625 --> 02:04:28.828 region:rollup2
THEY HANDLE THE YOU KNOW THE THE

02:04:27.493 --> 02:04:30.930 region:rollup2
NEWS AND IN THE STOMACH COUNTY

02:04:28.828 --> 02:04:34.100 region:rollup2
AREA ALL GROUND ZERO FOR FOR THE

02:04:30.930 --> 02:04:35.001 region:rollup2
FIRES --

02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.103 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:04:35.001 --> 02:04:38.938 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT AREA PROBABLY AS A

02:04:37.103 --> 02:04:40.940 region:rollup2
RESENTMENT RATE.

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:42.875 region:rollup2
PGP HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:45.311 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY A ROUTE BUT THIS

02:04:42.875 --> 02:04:46.713 region:rollup2
NEWSPAPER SAYS THE PLAN.

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:48.715 region:rollup2
THAT ESSENTIALLY IS BEFORE US

02:04:46.713 --> 02:04:49.215 region:rollup2
TODAY IS NOT A RATE PAYER BAIL

02:05:00.059 --> 02:05:03.129 region:rollup2
IN MAKE THEM PAY AS MUCH AS THEY

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.930 region:rollup2
COULD POSSIBLY PAY THAT IT'S GOT

02:05:03.129 --> 02:05:05.598 region:rollup2
TO BE.

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:07.567 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONVICTION THAT WE HAVE

02:05:05.598 --> 02:05:09.035 region:rollup2
THEY'VE GOT A THEY'VE GOT TO

02:05:07.567 --> 02:05:10.436 region:rollup2
HAVE THE FIRST DOLLAR AND SKIN

02:05:09.035 --> 02:05:12.905 region:rollup2
IN THE GAME.

02:05:10.436 --> 02:05:14.707 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT PLAN.

02:05:12.905 --> 02:05:16.442 region:rollup2
WE LOSE ALL THAT AND AND I

02:05:14.707 --> 02:05:18.311 region:rollup2
REALLY BELIEVE THAT ARE VICTIMS.

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:19.445 region:rollup2
IT OUR RATEPAYERS ARE GONNA JUST

02:05:18.311 --> 02:05:21.414 region:rollup2
PAY MORE AND MORE.

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:24.117 region:rollup2

TODAY WAS FIRST DAY.

02:05:30.023 --> 02:05:35.728 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT.

02:05:32.158 --> 02:05:38.398 region:rollup2
AND AS I'VE REVIEWED IT IT HAS.

02:05:35.728 --> 02:05:41.034 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF VERY TECHNICAL --

02:05:38.398 --> 02:05:44.103 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE.

02:05:41.034 --> 02:05:47.039 region:rollup2
AND IT IS --

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:49.709 region:rollup2
THIRTY OR SO PAGE DOCUMENT.

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:51.577 region:rollup2
ON WHAT IS A PROCESS I MEAN

02:05:49.709 --> 02:05:53.379 region:rollup2
TONIGHT ARE WE GONNA.

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:56.949 region:rollup2
IS CONTINUE ON WITH OUR JUST

GENERAL COMMENTS AT WHAT POINT.

02:05:56.949 --> 02:06:00.119 region:rollup2

02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:02.055 region:rollup2
I'D LOVE TO HEAR WHAT THE PUBLIC

02:06:02.055 --> 02:06:05.291 region:rollup2
BUT I I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'D

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:07.160 region:rollup2
HAVE PROBABLY.

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:07.760 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T SEEN AT WAR HAVEN'T HAD

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:08.961 region:rollup2
A CHANCE TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:12.065 region:rollup2
WHAT.

02:06:08.961 --> 02:06:13.766 region:rollup2
I ALSO LIKE TO HEAR FROM.

THEY ARE ON THIS DOCUMENT.

02:06:15.568 --> 02:06:19.939 region:rollup2
I THINK GENERALLY WHAT WE'VE

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:22.008 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED GENERALLY ISN'T HERE.

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:23.543 region:rollup2
I CAN SAY THAT.

02:06:22.008 --> 02:06:25.878 region:rollup2
WITH SOME CERTAINTY BUT THE

02:06:23.543 --> 02:06:28.614 region:rollup2
DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS.

02:06:25.878 --> 02:06:30.917 region:rollup2
AND AND I MEAN THE CLOCK IS

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:32.919 region:rollup2
TICKING AND WE HAVE A WEEK.

02:06:30.917 --> 02:06:34.387 region:rollup2

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:19.065 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL IT IT'S A PRODUCT

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:22.368 region:rollup2
THAT -- HAS

02:07:19.065 --> 02:07:23.236 region:rollup2
HAD SOME EVOLUTION FROM WHEN WE

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:24.637 region:rollup2
HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

02:07:23.236 --> 02:07:26.606 region:rollup2
IT --

02:07:24.637 --> 02:07:28.941 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY EVENING AND WE SPENT

02:07:26.606 --> 02:07:30.710 region:rollup2
ABOUT THREE HOURS AS A AS OUR

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:32.979 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY CONFEREES KIND OF GOING

02:07:30.710 --> 02:07:33.846 region:rollup2
THROUGH IT AND HAVING A CHANCE

02:07:32.979 --> 02:07:35.448 region:rollup2
TO GET.

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:37.083 region:rollup2
TO A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COMFORT I

02:07:35.448 --> 02:07:38.484 region:rollup2
THINK THAT AS A RESULT OF THAT

02:07:37.083 --> 02:07:41.587 region:rollup2
THERE WERE --

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:42.622 region:rollup2
SOME THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF WHAT.

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:45.791 region:rollup2
THE NEXT STEP MIGHT BE IN TERMS

02:07:42.622 --> 02:07:47.260 region:rollup2
OF OUR REACTION TO IT.

02:07:45.791 --> 02:07:48.628 region:rollup2
ARE I DO THINK --

02:07:47.260 --> 02:07:49.662 region:rollup2
CLEARLY.

02:07:48.628 --> 02:07:53.432 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HEARD FROM [inaudible]

02:07:49.662 --> 02:07:54.867 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY AND

02:07:53.432 --> 02:07:58.304 region:rollup2
ALSO FROM SELLING AMAZES FOR

02:07:54.867 --> 02:08:01.607 region:rollup2
REACTION TO WHAT THEY SAW AND

02:07:58.304 --> 02:08:03.209 region:rollup2
GIVING A ARE THEIR REFLECTION IN

02:08:01.607 --> 02:08:06.112 region:rollup2
THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW IT

02:08:03.209 --> 02:08:08.481 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE MASSAGED --

02:08:06.112 --> 02:08:12.151 region:rollup2
SILLY RADIUS HAS IDENTIFIED A

02:08:08.481 --> 02:08:13.452 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF AREAS AND THIS --

02:08:12.151 --> 02:08:15.121 region:rollup2
GIVING THE DIRECTION TO P. YOU

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:16.189 region:rollup2
SEE AND WHAT.

02:08:15.121 --> 02:08:18.090 region:rollup2
TOOLS MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN

02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:19.025 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AROUND THAT THAT AND

02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:20.159 region:rollup2
THEN THERE'S SOME OTHER AREAS I

02:08:19.025 --> 02:08:20.726 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO LIMIT IT TO THAT

02:08:20.159 --> 02:08:23.162 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:08:20.726 --> 02:08:25.131 region:rollup2
SHE IS A SHARED WITH WITH OUR

02:08:23.162 --> 02:08:26.599 region:rollup2
STAFF FOR THEM TO TAKE INTO

02:08:25.131 --> 02:08:27.967 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION --

02:08:26.599 --> 02:08:29.969 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HAS BEEN

02:08:27.967 --> 02:08:31.604 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN COMMUNICATIONS NOT

02:08:29.969 --> 02:08:34.340 region:rollup2
ONLY WITH WITH OUR SIDE BUT I

02:08:31.604 --> 02:08:35.641 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THROUGH --

02:08:34.340 --> 02:08:37.710 region:rollup2
SENATOR --

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:39.145 region:rollup2
OF MIKE MAKE CULTURE --

02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:41.547 region:rollup2
SENATOR DODD.

02:08:39.145 --> 02:08:43.282 region:rollup2
AND SO TOMORROW I THINK THE IDEA

02:08:41.547 --> 02:08:46.419 region:rollup2
IS TO BE ABLE BETWEEN NOW AND

02:08:43.282 --> 02:08:48.254 region:rollup2
THEN. TO TAKE COMMENTS FROM

02:08:46.419 --> 02:08:51.224 region:rollup2
OTHER MEMBERS.

02:08:48.254 --> 02:08:52.391 region:rollup2
A AND THEN TRIED A FASHION.

02:08:51.224 --> 02:08:53.459 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF A DIRECTION

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:55.361 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY SENATOR DODD AND I

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:56.729 region:rollup2
WILL.

02:08:55.361 --> 02:08:58.464 region:rollup2
HILL WORK WITH THE THE SENATE

02:08:56.729 --> 02:08:59.699 region:rollup2
CONFEREES AND OUR WORK WITH THE

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:01.901 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY CONFEREES WILL GET

02:08:59.699 --> 02:09:03.936 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND WE'LL --

02:09:01.901 --> 02:09:06.072 region:rollup2
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN SORT OF PULL

02:09:03.936 --> 02:09:07.773 region:rollup2
TOGETHER THE FINAL PIECES.

02:09:06.072 --> 02:09:09.108 region:rollup2
THERE ARE STILL SOME OTHER PARTS

02:09:07.773 --> 02:09:11.577 region:rollup2
OF THIS THAT STAFF IS IN THE

02:09:09.108 --> 02:09:13.512 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF WERE SMITHING --

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:14.680 region:rollup2
BUT I DO.

02:09:13.512 --> 02:09:15.915 region:rollup2
BELIEVES THAT WE ARE MOVING IN

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.016 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK

02:09:15.915 --> 02:09:18.584 region:rollup2
THE GOAL IS FOR US TO COME BACK

02:09:17.016 --> 02:09:20.386 region:rollup2
TOMORROW.

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:22.054 region:rollup2
WITH THE PRODUCT THAT WE CAN.

02:09:20.386 --> 02:09:24.257 region:rollup2
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY --

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:25.858 region:rollup2
TO HAVE IT'S ACTUALLY IT WOULD

02:09:24.257 --> 02:09:27.126 region:rollup2
BE A VOTE BUT IT'S ESSENTIALLY.

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:28.928 region:rollup2
HAVING MEMBERS SIGNED ON TO THE

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:30.696 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE REPORT.

02:09:28.928 --> 02:09:32.531 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU'D HAVE THREE WHAT'S

02:09:30.696 --> 02:09:33.799 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE HAVE THREE

02:09:32.531 --> 02:09:35.801 region:rollup2
MEMBERS FROM EACH --

02:09:33.799 --> 02:09:37.970 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:39.538 region:rollup2
OR FROM ITS DELEGATION TO TO

02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:40.840 region:rollup2
SIGN ON TO THEN MAKE IT.

02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:42.508 region:rollup2
IT'S WAY TO THE FLOOR.

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.744 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:46.178 region:rollup2
HOW THAT WOULDN'T UNFOLDS OF

02:09:44.744 --> 02:09:47.213 region:rollup2
THREE SENATORS AND THREE

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:49.282 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS --

02:09:47.213 --> 02:09:50.616 region:rollup2
SIGN ON THEN.

02:09:49.282 --> 02:09:52.918 region:rollup2
THEN THE A CONFERENCE REPORT

02:09:50.616 --> 02:09:54.220 region:rollup2
MOVES FORWARD FOR THE FOR BOTH

02:09:52.918 --> 02:09:56.155 region:rollup2
BODIES TO TO REVIEW.

02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:57.623 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES

02:09:56.155 --> 02:09:58.291 region:rollup2
UPPER DOWN VOTE.

02:09:57.623 --> 02:10:01.894 region:rollup2
ON THE MATERIAL NOTHING COULD BE

02:09:58.291 --> 02:10:02.194 region:rollup2
AMENDED AT THAT POINT

02:10:01.894 --> 02:10:04.230 region:rollup2
[inaudible]

02:10:02.194 --> 02:10:05.731 region:rollup2
SO.

02:10:04.230 --> 02:10:07.066 region:rollup2
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW WHERE WE WE

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:08.701 region:rollup2
THIS PART OF THIS PROCESS IS

02:10:07.066 --> 02:10:10.269 region:rollup2
JUST TO CONTINUE TO BE

02:10:08.701 --> 02:10:10.970 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENT TO SHARE WITH THE

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:12.505 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:15.608 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE AT THE TIME THAT WE

02:10:12.505 --> 02:10:16.742 region:rollup2
GET THERE AND SO THIS IS STILL A

02:10:15.608 --> 02:10:18.477 region:rollup2
WORK IN PROGRESS YOU'VE HEARD

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:21.047 region:rollup2
MEMBERS CHARACTERIZE IT IN?

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:21.681 region:rollup2
A VARIETY OF WAYS OTHER SOME WHO

02:10:21.047 --> 02:10:23.015 region:rollup2
HAVE NOT YET COMPLETELY READ IT

02:10:21.681 --> 02:10:25.184 region:rollup2
--

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:26.652 region:rollup2
THE OVER ARCHING GOALS I THINK

02:10:25.184 --> 02:10:28.087 region:rollup2
ARE CONSISTENT.

02:10:26.652 --> 02:10:30.222 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY VERY HARD

02:10:28.087 --> 02:10:30.856 region:rollup2
TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:36.862 region:rollup2
PRODUCT THAT WE CAN BRING FORTH

02:10:30.856 --> 02:10:38.164 region:rollup2
--

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:39.298 region:rollup2
FOR TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD.

02:10:38.164 --> 02:10:41.133 region:rollup2

KEEP IN MIND THE CLOCK IS

SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN VERY

02:11:34.787 --> 02:11:40.159 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED BY --

AND I HAVE TO AREAS OF COMMENT

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:08.680 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS THAT THE BILL

ADDRESSES FOREST EXEMPTIONS FOR

02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:11.916 region:rollup2

BEEN SAVING THE LARGEST TREES IN

02:33:19.090 --> 02:33:22.360 region:rollup2
THE STAND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER

02:33:20.892 --> 02:33:23.961 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS ON ALLOWING THOSE

02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:25.763 region:rollup2

02:33:27.031 --> 02:33:30.101 region:rollup2
KINDS OF RESTRICTIONS.

02:33:28.533 --> 02:33:30.601 region:rollup2

TO A FUEL IT COMES FROM A

02:33:40.411 --> 02:33:44.182 region:rollup2
FITTINGS FROM EXEMPTIONS AND

02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:45.783 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY MODEST.

02:33:44.182 --> 02:33:46.417 region:rollup2
THIS BIOMASS BUSINESSES A SCALE

02:33:45.783 --> 02:33:47.819 region:rollup2

BUT I REALLY DO THINK IT

02:44:51.882 --> 02:44:55.586 region:rollup2
ENCAPSULATES A LOT OF THE

02:44:54.184 --> 02:44:56.820 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS DUMB AND ACTUALLY THE

02:44:55.586 --> 02:44:58.155 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

A PLACE WHERE --

02:45:27.351 --> 02:45:30.954 region:rollup2

02:46:19.770 --> 02:46:23.373 region:rollup2
REASONABLE --

02:46:21.839 --> 02:46:25.642 region:rollup2

02:49:30.193 --> 02:49:35.265 region:rollup2
MORE THAN JUST A SINGLE BILL.

02:49:32.496 --> 02:49:37.667 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS MORE THAN JUST A

02:49:35.265 --> 02:49:39.202 region:rollup2
YEAH YOU KNOW A VERY LIMITED --

02:49:37.667 --> 02:49:40.337 region:rollup2
FUNDING MECHANISM THERE HAVE

02:49:39.202 --> 02:49:41.638 region:rollup2
BEEN -- I

02:49:40.337 --> 02:49:43.540 region:rollup2
THINK IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:45.609 region:rollup2
PERHAPS GOING FOR WE COULD FIND

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:48.912 region:rollup2
SOME OTHER RESOURCES FINANCIAL

02:49:45.609 --> 02:49:49.880 region:rollup2
RESOURCES. TO DEAL WITH A AYE

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:52.883 region:rollup2
BROADER --

02:49:49.880 --> 02:49:54.851 region:rollup2
APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THESE

02:49:52.883 --> 02:49:57.287 region:rollup2
WE'VE GOT THAT THE ISSUE OF A

02:49:54.851 --> 02:49:58.522 region:rollup2
BIOMASS BUT WE ALSO HAVE A WHOLE

02:49:57.287 --> 02:50:00.223 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF OTHER TOOLS IN THE

02:49:58.522 --> 02:50:01.491 region:rollup2
TOOLBOX SOME OF WHICH ARE BEING

02:50:00.223 --> 02:50:03.160 region:rollup2
FUNDED SO.

02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:05.028 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A IT'S A BIGGER

02:50:03.160 --> 02:50:06.663 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION --

02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:07.564 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE NOT THAT WE

02:50:06.663 --> 02:50:09.399 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE THIS ANY MORE

02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:10.767 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED THAN IT IS BUT JUST

02:50:09.399 --> 02:50:12.502 region:rollup2
AS WE THINKABOUT THIS.

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:14.104 region:rollup2
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS GOING

02:50:12.502 --> 02:50:15.205 region:rollup2
ALONG A GOING ON THIS WELL NOW I

02:50:14.104 --> 02:50:16.640 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT

02:50:15.205 --> 02:50:17.908 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LIFE

02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.143 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK IT'S

02:50:17.908 --> 02:50:20.844 region:rollup2
ALSO SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WE HAD

02:50:20.143 --> 02:50:22.345 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR HEARINGS A

02:50:20.844 --> 02:50:23.413 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION OF ALL THE BILLS

02:50:22.345 --> 02:50:24.948 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ACTIVE THAT.

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:27.084 region:rollup2
WE ARE GOING TO REFERENCE THAT I

02:50:24.948 --> 02:50:28.819 region:rollup2
THINK APPROPRIATELY CONNECTED TO

02:50:27.084 --> 02:50:31.188 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

02:50:28.819 --> 02:50:32.022 region:rollup2
OF THIS NOW I THINK PROBABLY THE

02:50:31.188 --> 02:50:33.523 region:rollup2
BEST WAY I CONNECTS.

02:50:32.022 --> 02:50:35.592 region:rollup2
SIR FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MOVE

02:50:33.523 --> 02:50:38.195 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND I THINK WHAT'S BEEN

02:50:35.592 --> 02:50:40.497 region:rollup2
AFFECTED TO THIS POINT IS WHEN.

02:50:38.195 --> 02:50:41.798 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET EVERYONE

02:50:40.497 --> 02:50:44.434 region:rollup2
AROUND THIS TABLE --

02:50:41.798 --> 02:50:45.736 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AT ANY ONE TIME YOU

02:50:44.434 --> 02:50:47.604 region:rollup2
KNOW HAVING ANOTHER.

02:50:45.736 --> 02:50:49.272 region:rollup2
OF POSTED MEETING SO WHAT'S BEEN

02:50:47.604 --> 02:50:51.141 region:rollup2
AFFECTED I THINK WAS WHEN THE

02:50:49.272 --> 02:50:52.676 region:rollup2
SENATE CONFEREES WERE WORK

02:50:51.141 --> 02:50:54.211 region:rollup2
WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE CHAIR.

02:50:52.676 --> 02:50:56.046 region:rollup2
AND ASSEMBLY CONFEREES AND I

02:50:54.211 --> 02:50:57.114 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS MAKE

02:50:56.046 --> 02:50:59.049 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

02:50:57.114 --> 02:51:00.684 region:rollup2
WERE WERE SORT OF NARROWING DOWN

02:50:59.049 --> 02:51:02.586 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE WE'RE

02:51:00.684 --> 02:51:04.788 region:rollup2
GETTING VERY CLOSE TO THAT BUT

02:51:02.586 --> 02:51:08.358 region:rollup2
WHATEVER OUTSTANDING PARTS.

02:51:04.788 --> 02:51:10.360 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO IDENTIFY THEN --

02:51:08.358 --> 02:51:12.262 region:rollup2
SENATOR DODD AND I CAN GET

02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:13.864 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND AND SORT OF MAKE

02:51:12.262 --> 02:51:15.332 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THEY'RE MOVING

02:51:13.864 --> 02:51:17.534 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATELY --

02:51:15.332 --> 02:51:18.869 region:rollup2
WITH THE APPROPRIATE STAFF

02:51:17.534 --> 02:51:20.437 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ALSO.

02:51:18.869 --> 02:51:21.838 region:rollup2
THERE IS COMMUNICATION WITH THE

02:51:20.437 --> 02:51:23.773 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SO WE NEED

02:51:21.838 --> 02:51:25.475 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT --

02:51:23.773 --> 02:51:27.644 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE CHANNELS STAY OPEN IN

02:51:25.475 --> 02:51:29.679 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ABLE TO ACCESS --

02:51:27.644 --> 02:51:31.181 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK THAT WAY SO I THINK.

02:51:29.679 --> 02:51:32.816 region:rollup2
WELL WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE

02:51:31.181 --> 02:51:33.450 region:rollup2
IT IS THE LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE

02:51:32.816 --> 02:51:34.751 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S MOVING IN THE WAY THAT

02:51:33.450 --> 02:51:35.719 region:rollup2
--

02:51:34.751 --> 02:51:38.088 region:rollup2
WE ALL --

02:51:35.719 --> 02:51:39.990 region:rollup2
ANTICIPATING THAT IT WILL AND

02:51:38.088 --> 02:51:41.725 region:rollup2
THEN SENATOR DODD CAN.

02:51:39.990 --> 02:51:43.793 region:rollup2
SHARE INFORMATION WE CAN GET

02:51:41.725 --> 02:51:45.462 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND FIND OUT WHAT --

02:51:43.793 --> 02:51:46.329 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING ELEMENTS BECAUSE A I

02:51:45.462 --> 02:51:47.297 region:rollup2
KNOW A NUMBER OF YOUR MEMBERS

02:51:46.329 --> 02:51:48.965 region:rollup2
FOR THE FIRST TIME I HAVE AN

02:51:47.297 --> 02:51:51.268 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE DOCUMENT

02:51:48.965 --> 02:51:52.736 region:rollup2
SO TO THAT EXTENT THEY MAY HAVE

02:51:51.268 --> 02:51:55.238 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS TO SHARE WITH YOU.

02:51:52.736 --> 02:51:56.973 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF COURSE THE GOAL IS

02:51:55.238 --> 02:51:58.475 region:rollup2
FOR US TO RECONVENE AS A

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:59.709 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE --

02:51:58.475 --> 02:52:01.311 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A FINAL DOCUMENT THAT

02:51:59.709 --> 02:52:03.914 region:rollup2
WE CAN.

02:52:01.311 --> 02:52:04.881 region:rollup2
A TAKE ACTION ON TOMORROW.

02:52:03.914 --> 02:52:06.216 region:rollup2
BUT I GUESS THE GOAL WOULD BE TO

02:52:04.881 --> 02:52:08.151 region:rollup2
TRY TO DO IT IS EARLY IN THE DAY

02:52:06.216 --> 02:52:09.219 region:rollup2
AS WE CAN BUT YOU KNOW WILL HAVE

02:52:08.151 --> 02:52:10.754 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH THE CONSTRAINTS

02:52:09.219 --> 02:52:11.488 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE --

02:52:10.754 --> 02:52:15.225 region:rollup2
BUT CERTAINLY --

02:52:11.488 --> 02:52:17.627 region:rollup2
NO LATER THAN.

02:52:15.225 --> 02:52:19.829 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO DO IT EARLY.

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:20.430 region:rollup2
CONSPIRACY EARLY AS WE CAN.

02:52:19.829 --> 02:52:21.031 region:rollup2
SO IF WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:23.633 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS [inaudible]

02:52:21.031 --> 02:52:24.434 region:rollup2
YES -- IS

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:25.535 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SENATOR STONE THE

02:52:24.434 --> 02:52:26.303 region:rollup2
BROUGHT THE SUPPER EARLIER AND

02:52:25.535 --> 02:52:28.138 region:rollup2
I'VE NOT SEEN THIS IN THE

02:52:26.303 --> 02:52:29.472 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE BUT IN REGARDS TO A

02:52:28.138 --> 02:52:31.842 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR SUNSET.

02:52:29.472 --> 02:52:34.077 region:rollup2
I THINK FIVE YEARS IS MUCH --

02:52:31.842 --> 02:52:35.178 region:rollup2
TOO EARLY I WOULD THINK AT LEAST

02:52:34.077 --> 02:52:36.780 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS IF NOT --

02:52:35.178 --> 02:52:37.681 region:rollup2
IF NOT LONGER SO AGAIN I HAVE

02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:39.349 region:rollup2
NOT SEEN THAT LANGUAGE BUT IF

02:52:37.681 --> 02:52:40.684 region:rollup2
SENATOR SENATOR CORRECTIVE IS A

02:52:39.349 --> 02:52:41.818 region:rollup2
FIVE YEAR SUNSET.

02:52:40.684 --> 02:52:44.187 region:rollup2
ON THIS I DO BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO

02:52:41.818 --> 02:52:46.022 region:rollup2
BE AT LEAST EXTENDED HER AND I'M

02:52:44.187 --> 02:52:48.258 region:rollup2
NOT SURE WE HAD A LEAD ON A

02:52:46.022 --> 02:52:50.493 region:rollup2
SUNSET OF THE NEEDS OF SOARED.

02:52:48.258 --> 02:52:51.127 region:rollup2
IT'S IN THE LANGUAGE THAT WHICH

02:52:50.493 --> 02:52:55.365 region:rollup2
WHICH PIECE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

02:52:51.127 --> 02:52:59.202 region:rollup2
--

02:52:55.365 --> 02:53:00.503 region:rollup2
OKAY [inaudible]

02:52:59.202 --> 02:53:02.472 region:rollup2
GOT IT.

02:53:00.503 --> 02:53:07.777 region:rollup2
I GOT IT [inaudible]

02:53:02.472 --> 02:53:09.312 region:rollup2
OKAY.

02:53:07.777 --> 02:53:10.347 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN A FIVE YEAR ARE YOU

02:53:09.312 --> 02:53:12.382 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE SUNSET FOR THE

02:53:10.347 --> 02:53:14.217 region:rollup2
ENTIRE BILL.

02:53:12.382 --> 02:53:15.252 region:rollup2
WHO CLOSER SAYING I THINK IN IN

02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:17.087 region:rollup2
REGARDS TO THROUGH THE ENTIRE

02:53:15.252 --> 02:53:18.688 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS I'M NOT SURE THAT ANY

02:53:17.087 --> 02:53:21.191 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS SHOULD BE AND IF

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:22.559 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --

02:53:21.191 --> 02:53:23.460 region:rollup2
FOREST.

02:53:22.559 --> 02:53:26.129 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT ORG OR FIRE

02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:28.198 region:rollup2
PREVENTION I THINK.

02:53:26.129 --> 02:53:29.699 region:rollup2
A FIVE YEAR SUNSET IS JUST TO

02:53:28.198 --> 02:53:30.367 region:rollup2
TOO EARLY I THINK TEN YEARS

02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:31.101 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A MINIMUM I DON'T KNOW

02:53:30.367 --> 02:53:32.302 region:rollup2
WHAT PARTS.

02:53:31.101 --> 02:53:33.536 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S FIVE YEAR BUT I

02:53:32.302 --> 02:53:35.005 region:rollup2
WOULD THINK THAT TEN YEARS IT

02:53:33.536 --> 02:53:36.439 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A SHOULD BE A MINIMUM

02:53:35.005 --> 02:53:37.173 region:rollup2
AGAIN I THINK.

02:53:36.439 --> 02:53:38.541 region:rollup2
THAT DEPENDING ON HOW IT'S

02:53:37.173 --> 02:53:40.610 region:rollup2
CRAFTED BUT FIVE IS JUST SEEMS

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:42.646 region:rollup2
TO BE TOO SOON.

02:53:40.610 --> 02:53:46.049 region:rollup2
IT'S AT PAGE THIRTY ONE OF THE

02:53:42.646 --> 02:53:50.687 region:rollup2
FIRST DRAFT FROM LAST NIGHT.

02:53:46.049 --> 02:53:51.254 region:rollup2
JUST BEFORE SECTION.

02:53:50.687 --> 02:53:54.224 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR IT'S REFERRED TO

02:53:51.254 --> 02:53:55.292 region:rollup2
SECTION.

02:53:54.224 --> 02:53:56.926 region:rollup2
TWENTY THREE IF I COULD --

02:53:55.292 --> 02:53:58.328 region:rollup2
MEMBERS I THINK IT.

02:53:56.926 --> 02:54:00.897 region:rollup2
REFER COULD HAVE I THINK WOULD

02:53:58.328 --> 02:54:02.332 region:rollup2
BE MORE EFFICIENT IF WE MAKE

02:54:00.897 --> 02:54:03.733 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE I THINK

02:54:02.332 --> 02:54:05.135 region:rollup2
GATHERING THE INFORMATION IN THE

02:54:03.733 --> 02:54:06.202 region:rollup2
COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

02:54:05.135 --> 02:54:07.504 region:rollup2
MEMBERS.

02:54:06.202 --> 02:54:08.772 region:rollup2
AND ALSO FROM THE PUBLIC I THINK

02:54:07.504 --> 02:54:10.507 region:rollup2
WE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION

02:54:08.772 --> 02:54:12.175 region:rollup2
AS WE CAUCUS.

02:54:10.507 --> 02:54:13.677 region:rollup2
AND THEN --

02:54:12.175 --> 02:54:16.646 region:rollup2
WILL GET BACK TOGETHER OF THE

02:54:13.677 --> 02:54:17.180 region:rollup2
TWO CHAIRS AND AND MAKE SURE

02:54:16.646 --> 02:54:18.481 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S MOVING WITH THE

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:20.083 region:rollup2
STAFF'S.

02:54:18.481 --> 02:54:21.651 region:rollup2
SO THAT WE CAN SHEPHERDED ALL

02:54:20.083 --> 02:54:24.154 region:rollup2
THE WAY THROUGH [inaudible]

02:54:21.651 --> 02:54:40.603 region:rollup2
THE OKAY.

02:54:24.154 --> 02:54:40.603 region:rollup2
IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS
