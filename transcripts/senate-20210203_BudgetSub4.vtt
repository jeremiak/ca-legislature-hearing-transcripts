MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE HOW

00:08:39.619 --> 00:08:40.486
DOES THIS INTERFACE WITH FISCAL

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:44.490

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.560
RAISED BY THE L. A. R. R. R. R.

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:49.228
PRETTY IMPORTANT GIVEN THIS.

00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.631
THE CHALLENGES WE'VE FACED WITH

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:53.466
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN THE

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.002
PAST- COULD YOU PLEASE ADDRESS

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.371
THE ISSUES THAT THAT THE- L. A-

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:02.008
RAISED. YES I CAN MANAGER MY

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.743
NAME IS CHRIS MAYO AND I'M THE

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:05.745
DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:08.514
STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT I

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.448
COULD WALK THROUGH THEM TOP TO

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.284
BOTTOM AND I ALSO- CONNECT YOUR

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.919
QUESTIONS ABOUT- HOW WILL

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:15.988
INTERFACE WITH CISCO. SO WHY IS

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.157
THIS YEAR PREPARE FOR PROPOSING

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:22.929
YOUR REPLACE U. NINE CARE YOU.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.097
UNIFORMS APRIL SYSTEM. WELL

00:09:25.164 --> 00:09:27.934
QUITE SIMPLY TODAY'S SYSTEM

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.001
FORTY FIVE OLD. IT WAS FIRST

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.903
DEVELOPED BEFORE THE ADVENT OF

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.771
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.606
STATE. AND OVER THE PAST FOUR

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:35.141
AND A HALF DECADES NEW

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:37.209
PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DEFINED AND

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:38.511
PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SYSTEM

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:41.580
HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO MEET THOSE

00:09:41.647 --> 00:09:43.149
NEEDS. THE EMPLOYEE POPULATION

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.818
HAS GROWN AND THE COMPLEX

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.687
PAYROLL RULES KEEP COMING.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.021
TODAY THERE ARE OVER THIRTY

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:50.356
NUMBER THIRTEEN UNDERLYING

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.691
SYSTEMS THAT COMPRISE THE

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.292
OVERALL PAYROLL SYSTEM AND

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:53.893
THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.728
INTEGRATED. THEY'RE NOT EASY TO

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.531
OPERATE MAINTAIN AND THEY'RE

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.132
VERY TIME CONSUMING TO CHANGE.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:01.434
SOME OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WE

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.601
NEED TO REPLACE THE PAYROLL

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.103
SYSTEM INCLUDE THE NEED TO

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.972
HAVE. THE ABILITY FOR TIMELY

00:10:06.038 --> 00:10:08.140
IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:09.709
LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO

00:10:09.775 --> 00:10:11.744
PAYROLL AND PROCESSING OF-

00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:14.347
PERSONNEL ACTIONS. WE NEED AN

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:15.715
EMPLOYEE SELF SERVICE AND

00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.284
MANAGER SELF SERVICE CAPABILITY

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:20.619
THAT'S NOT CAPABLE- ACROSS OUR

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:22.722
CURRENT SYSTEMS. WE NEED

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:24.156
AUTOMATED DATA VALIDATION AND

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:26.993
COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION CHECKS.

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.160
IMPROVED ACCESS TO DATA

00:10:28.227 --> 00:10:33.065
REPORTING AND DATA ANALYTICS-

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:33.933
CLEARLY WE NEED BETTER

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.968
INTEGRATED BUSINESS PROCESSES

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:37.737
ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.705
THE PAYROLL SYSTEM ENCOMPASSES

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:40.806
AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.141
INCLUDING OF COURSE A TECHNICAL

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:43.776
ARCHITECTURE REFRESH AGAIN THE

00:10:43.843 --> 00:10:46.912
SYSTEM IS FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:48.514
AS OF AS OF RIGHT NOW. WELL ALL

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:49.648
THESE REASONS ARE GENERALLY

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.784
EXISTED- SINCE THE NEED TO

00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:53.085
REPLACE THE PAYROLL SYSTEM WAS

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.787
FIRST IDENTIFIED OVER TWENTY

00:10:54.854 --> 00:10:58.524
YEARS AGO- PRIOR CLAIMS ABOUT

00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.292
THE SYSTEM BEING ABLE TO CRASH-

00:11:00.359 --> 00:11:02.828
EXISTENCE- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:04.563
THAT I SPEAK UP TODAY. THE

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.998
SYSTEM IS NOT ABOUT TO CRASH

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.667
AND IT'S THROUGH THE YOU KNOW

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.236
THE GREAT EFFORTS OF THE STATE

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.671
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IT STAFF.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.106
AND THE STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.241
TECHNOLOGY TO CONTINUE TO

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:16.442
MAINFRAME MAINTAIN THE

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:19.311
APPLICATIONS UNDERLYING

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:22.381
ARCHITECTURE. NONE THE LESS THE

00:11:22.448 --> 00:11:23.382
SURVEY OF ALL THESE FOLKS

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.518
INDICATE THAT 85% OF THEM AGREE

00:11:25.584 --> 00:11:27.153
THAT A NEW SYSTEM WOULD RESOLVE

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.454
MANY OF THE LEGACY PAYROLL

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.457
SYSTEM LIMITATIONS. SO THE SCO

00:11:31.524 --> 00:11:32.525
IS DETERMINED TO PROVIDE A

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:35.161
BETTER MODERN PAYROLL SYSTEM

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:37.129
THAT PROVIDES YOU IMPROVE

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.764
CUSTOMER SERVICE PROGRAM

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:42.368
EFFICIENCIES AND A MUCH NEEDED

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:44.770
TECHNOLOGY REFRESH. WHAT THANK

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.205
YOU FOR THAT I DON'T THINK THE

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:47.706
QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE NEED IT

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.675
IT'S A QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:51.410
WHAT PROCESS SHOULD WE USED TO

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:52.178
BROUGH PLACES AND AT LEAST

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:55.481
THAT'S MY- THAT'S MY- AND YEAH

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:56.649
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:58.417
NEXT POINT OF MY QUESTION- SITE

00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:01.921
HERE IS YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WE

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:02.488
RECOMMEND THAT WE DO AT THIS

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.789
POINT. THE RECOMMENDED SOLUTION

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.125
IS FOR CS PS TO ACQUIRE AND

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.394
COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF OFFICE-

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:10.429
SISTER. THIS WOULD INVOLVE THE

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:12.565
BRICK. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:14.567
FULL HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.235

FUNCTIONALITY OF SUPPORT ALL

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:21.407
THE MAIN BUSINESS CAPABILITIES

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:22.908
THAT ARE IN SCOPE FOR THE CSTS

00:12:22.975 --> 00:12:25.144
PROJECT INCLUDING. POSITION

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:33.185
ATTENDANCE ON OF COURSE PAYROLL.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.254
THE RATIONALE FOR THIS EMERGE

00:12:35.321 --> 00:12:36.522
FROM THE CLEAR ADVANTAGES

EXPERTISE OF VENDORS WHO HAVE

00:12:53.038 --> 00:12:54.240
BEEN BUILDING NEW SYSTEMS FOR

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:58.110
DECADES. AND THE A MUCH HIGHER

HEARD IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:13:03.415 --> 00:13:05.518
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ABOUT

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:06.385
FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:07.686
DOLLARS OF THAT WOULD BE

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:09.488
INCLUSIVE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.157
FEES CLOUD HOSTING.

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.359
IMPLEMENTATION OF ANCILLARY

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:17.596
SERVICES. WE DID LOOK AT OTHER

00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.865
SOLUTIONS OF COURSE. ONE OF THE

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:22.801
MAIN- SOLUTIONS WE LOOKED AT

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:26.705
WAS THE ACTUALLY TO- COMPLETE

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.707
THECONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.042
CURRENT SYSTEM SO WHAT WE WOULD

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.711
DO THERE IS AT ENHANCEMENTS TO

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.680
IT TO DEVELOP A MODERN LOOK AND

00:13:34.747 --> 00:13:38.117
FEEL. AND- DEAL WITH SOME OF

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.752
THE DATA VALIDATION RULES AND

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:42.354
THINGS THAT WE HAD- IN THE PAST

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:44.290
HOWEVER THAT SOLUTION DIDN'T

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:45.991
MEET ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES OF

00:13:46.058 --> 00:13:47.993
THIS PROJECT AND IT WOULD CAUSE

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.395
US TO NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:13:49.461 --> 00:13:50.763
ADVANTAGE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.798
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE REALLY

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.100
NEED TO DO. OTHER SOLUTIONS NOT

00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.802
SPEAK BRIEFLY OF THEM ARE TO

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.804
DEVELOP A CUSTOM SOLUTION.

00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:00.472
HOWEVER NO NO ONE STEPPED

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:01.840
FORWARD DURING MARKET RESEARCH

00:14:01.907 --> 00:14:04.677
DID INDICATE THAT BUILDING A

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:05.244
CUSTOM SOLUTION WOULD BE THE

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:07.846
WAY TO GO- AGAIN THIS MARKET IS

00:14:07.913 --> 00:14:09.348
VERY MATURE NOW AND THERE'S

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.517
THEIR SOLUTIONS THAT EXIST AND

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:12.084
NO ONE WOULD NEED TO REWRITE

00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:14.887
THEM. BEST OF BREED IS ANOTHER

00:14:14.954 --> 00:14:17.523
OPTION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY BY.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.159

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.594
COMPONENTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.828
OF THE PROJECT AND THEN THE

00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.797
INTERFACE THEM. BUT AGAIN

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:26.332
DURING MARKET RESEARCH WE ONLY

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.566
HAD A HANDFUL OF FIRMS COME

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.701
FORWARD AND THEY WOULD ONLY

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:30.736
ADDRESS SPECIFIC LINES OF

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:32.137
BUSINESSES AND THE STATE WOULD

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.339
BE POSITION TO HAVE TO BE THE

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.341
SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR TO TIE THEM

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:40.679
ALL TOGETHER. AND FINALLY- AS

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:42.481
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE S. A. P.

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.483
PRODUCT. HOWEVER DURING

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.252
CONSULTANT- DURING MARKET

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:48.887
RESEARCH SAME THING NO ONE STEP

00:14:48.954 --> 00:14:49.989
FORWARD TO PROPOSE THAT WE DO

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:52.291
THAT. AND THE SOFTWARE ITSELF

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:53.826
IS NOW SEVERAL VERSIONS BEHIND

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.294
AND REALLY JUST NOT A VIABLE

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:59.031
OPTION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT

00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:00.933

IF I MADE THAT THE FIVE MILLION

00:41:04.628 --> 00:41:07.298
ALLOCATION IS PART OF THE EARLY

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:09.834

OFFICE. SORT OF BORED

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.658
BOMB WE FIND THAT THE CONCEPT

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:37.461
OF USING ART TO PROMOTE PUBLIC

00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:39.630
HEALTH MESSAGING HAS MERIT-

00:41:39.697 --> 00:41:41.031
HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THERE ARE

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:43.100
SEVERAL KEY IMPLEMENTATION

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.603
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL-

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.004
REMAIN UNANSWERED. ONE OF THE

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.839
FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE IS WHO

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:50.474
WOULD ADMINISTER THE GRANT AT

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.243
THIS TIME ARTS COUNCIL'S TRYING

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.344
TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WOULD

00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:55.679
DIRECTLY ALLOCATE FUNDS TO-

00:41:55.746 --> 00:41:57.381
ARTISTS IN THE FIELD OR IT

00:41:57.448 --> 00:41:59.450
WOULD RELY ON LOCAL PARTNERS TO

00:41:59.516 --> 00:42:00.651
IDENTIFY AN ARTIST THAT WOULD

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.453
RECEIVE THE GRANTS. OR IF THE

00:42:02.519 --> 00:42:04.054
GRANT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:05.456
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THESE

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:08.659
TWO SIR- APPROACHES ON THERE'S

00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:10.861
VARIOUS PROS AND CONS TO EITHER

00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:12.263
OF THESE APPROACHES FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.397
AT THE ARTS COUNCIL

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:14.665
ADMINISTERED IT ADDING MORE

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:16.834
STATEWIDE LEVEL YOU COULD

00:42:16.901 --> 00:42:18.302
EXPECT GREATER UNIFORMITY. OR

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.237
IS IT WAS ALLOCATED MORE BY

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:22.773
LOCAL PARTNERS- D. INDIVIDUALS

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.974
ACTUALLY AWARDING THE GRANT

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:26.210
MIGHT HAVE MORE INSIGHT INTO

00:42:26.277 --> 00:42:29.546
pTARGETED. IN EITHER CASE THE

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:31.115
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO

00:42:31.181 --> 00:42:32.516
GET CLARITY FROM ARTS COUNCIL

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:34.551
ON HOW IT'S GOING TO ADMINISTER

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:37.421
THE GRANT. IN ADDITION- WHILE

00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:40.124
LEAD COUNSEL HAS INDICATED- AS

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.958
YOU HEARD THAT FUNDS ARE GOING

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:42.693
TO BE TARGETED AT COMMUNITIES

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.128
THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:45.596
INCLUDING HISTORICALLY

00:42:45.663 --> 00:42:47.531
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES-

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:48.532
THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THE

00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:49.767
ALLOCATION PROCESS THAT WE

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.602
DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. SUCH

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.003
AS WHAT OTHER CRITERIA WOULD BE

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.805
CONSIDERED AND HOW THESE

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:55.639
CRITERIA WOULD BE WEIGHED

00:42:55.706 --> 00:42:57.174
AGAINST EACH OTHER THIS IS

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.409
CRITICAL BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP

00:42:58.475 --> 00:42:59.476
THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:00.978
WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDS ARE

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:02.179
GOING TO BE TARGETED IN A WAY

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:07.518
THAT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE.

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:08.352
TO ADDRESS CODE NINETEEN.

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.353
ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW PEOPLE

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:12.056
WOULD BE FIVE GRANT- YOU HEARD.

00:43:12.122 --> 00:43:13.657
OF THAT COUNCILS HOPING TO WORK

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.526
WITH- AROUND FIVE HUNDRED

00:43:15.592 --> 00:43:17.461
ARTISTS REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:18.996
EIGHT COUNTIES. HOWEVER AT THIS

00:43:19.063 --> 00:43:20.364
POINT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.266
HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT ENCOUNTER

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.133
THE ARTWORK THAT WOULD BE

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:24.835
SUPPORTED. AND THAT MAKES IT

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:26.203
DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.438
TO COMPARE THIS STRATEGY

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.939
AGAINST OTHER STRATEGIES THAT

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.307
MIGHT CONSIDER TO GET OUT

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:32.109
PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES LIKE

00:43:32.176 --> 00:43:33.944
ADVERTISING. IT'S ALSO A BIT

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.145
UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW THE

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:37.348
MATCHING ELEMENTS OF THE GRANT

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:39.083
PROGRAM WOULD WORK AND IT WE

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:40.217
THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:42.086
THE LEGISLATURE TO GET CLARITY

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.988
ON THISASPECT OF THE PROGRAM

00:43:44.054 --> 00:43:45.889
TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T.

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.491
CERTAINLY LIMIT WHICH ARTISTS

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:49.460
ARE ABLE TO. PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:52.796
PROGRAM. ALL AT THIS TIME WE

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:54.365
FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.367
SHOULD WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.801
PROPOSAL UNTIL THESE KEY

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.903
IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS ARE

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.638
ANSWERED HOWEVER IF THESE

00:44:01.705 --> 00:44:03.374
QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED TO THE

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.142
SATISFACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:06.510
AND THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.745
ON THIS COULD BE A COST

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:08.846
EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING OUT

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:10.280
HEALTH MESSAGING WE RECOMMEND

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:13.050
APPROVAL OBVIOUSLY. ARE THESE

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.385
QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED OR

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:15.953
THE ANSWERS ARE NOT TO THE

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.688
SATISFACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:18.155
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.524
LEGISLATURE I USE THIS FUNDING

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:23.660
IN OTHER WAYS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.928
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.297
YOU VERY MUCH FOR OUR COMMENT-

00:44:27.364 --> 00:44:29.600
SO I JUST WANNA BY SECOND AT

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:30.467
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.603
RAISED BY THE L. A. O. FOR THE

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:37.041
ARTS COUNCIL- I THINK- I AM I A

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.143
SUPPORT THE ARTS ND I THINK

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:39.977
THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN OUR

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:42.513
COMMUNITY FOR SO MANY REASONS

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.782
AND- RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A REAL

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:47.251
LACK OF HOPE IN THE COMMUNITY-

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:49.086
THE BACKS AND BAXEEN QUITE

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:52.956
FRANKLY OUR- OUR THE ONE BRIGHT

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.224
LIGHT ADDED ADDED THESE PAST.

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.193
TEN OR ELEVEN MONTHS- BUT I AM

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.995
CONCERNED AND REPRESENTING A

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:59.763
RURAL RURAL AGRICULTURAL

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.632
DISTRICT. WITH LOTS OF

00:45:01.698 --> 00:45:03.600
MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES UP THE

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.302
MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE FUNDS

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:08.038
DON'T END UP GETTING DOWN TO

00:45:08.105 --> 00:45:09.373
THE COMMUNITIES THAT I

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:12.142
REPRESENT FOR THE MOST PART-

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:16.647
ART. TENDS TO BE- SEEN AS A AT

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:20.484
EIGHT AM. A FEATURE OF MORE

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.419
WEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND YOU SEE

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:25.622
A LOT MORE INVESTMENT IN THOSE

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:26.723
WEALTHY COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.526
IN- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

00:45:29.593 --> 00:45:31.028
OF COLOR SO I JUST WANT TO SAY

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.463
THAT I'M I'M GONNA NEED A LOT

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.331
MORE INFORMATION AND I'D LIKE

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:41.538
IF YOU COULD- TO- GET TO THE%

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:44.475
THIS COMMITTEE A LIST OF THE

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:46.009
DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT YOU

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:48.245
HAVE HELP TO FIND IN PAST YEARS

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.347
SO THAT WE CAN GET AN IDEA OF

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.149
THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT.

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.717
HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:55.152
ARTS COUNCIL AND WHERE THEY'RE

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:58.222
LOCATED- AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN

00:45:58.288 --> 00:45:59.890
INVESTED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:01.725
THAT MIGHT TELL US A LITTLE BIT

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:04.695
ABOUT WHETHER. THE RESOURCES

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:06.430
THAT ARE IN THIS GRANT

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:09.833
APPLICATION OUR OUR RESOURCES

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.168
THAT SHOULD GO TO THE ARTS

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:14.171
COUNCIL AS OPPOSED. TO GOING

00:46:14.238 --> 00:46:15.973
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:18.041
EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE TO

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:19.977
COMMUNITIES ON THROUGH THEIR

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:23.914
SCHOOLS OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM
