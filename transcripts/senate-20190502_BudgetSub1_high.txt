LINED UP EXACTLY IN ORDER IS YOU'RE LISTED ON THE AGENDA. ALL THE INSTRUCTION TO WANTS TO START. THANK YOU. THIS IS ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY DISCUSS UC HASTINGS. A LOS BUDGET HERE THIS MORNING -- UC HASTINGS IS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM BUT IS GOVERNED BY ITS OWN BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ARE LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO IT PRIMARILY SERVES STUDENTS SEEKING INTEREST DOCTOR DEGREE BUT ALSO AS A MASTER OF LOS PROGRAMMING A MASTERS OF STUDIES IN ALL PROGRAM. I AM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN UC HASTINGS AND ALL NINE AND THIRTY FOUR FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS. OF THESE EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTEEN WERE JD STUDENTS ELSE WISHING FOR A STRESS DOCTOR PROGRAM THIS YEAR WAS. 440-003-0020 SIX DOLLARS AND TOOL WHEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EAST HASTINGS SO BUDGET PRIMARILY FUNDED BY GENERAL FUND AND TUITION AND FEES. IS EIGHTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WITH THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND BEING. NINETEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT TO TWO POINT 5% AUGMENTATION HE SEES THINGS THIS REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND ONGOING. I THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES ONE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT UC HASTINGS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. IN TOTAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS THE COLLEGE WILL BE SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO. THERE ARE TWO ISSUES BEFORE YOU IN THIS ITEM THE FIRST IS -- THE ONGOING BASED INCREASE AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. NOW WITH REGARD TO THE BASE INCREASE. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION ON ADOPTING REJECTING OR MODIFYING THE PROPOSAL -- BUT WE DO OFFER SOME ANALYSIS ON THE LAW SCHOOLS THE OVERALL BUDGET CONDITION -- THE LAW SCHOOL HAS HAD -- A DEFICIT. IN RECENT YEARS. AND IT'S IN THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATING THE DEFICIT. AND YOUR GENDER I TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE FIVE WHICH THE DISPLAYS A TABLE OF THE SCHOOLS -- OPERATING BALANCES AND RESERVES -- STARTING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND PROJECTIONS IN LATER YEARS. NO ONE THING I WOULD NOTE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIS TABLE IS THAT A FIFTY AS YOU'LL SEE IN FIGURE. TO THE TABLE INCLUDE SOME FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED HASTINGS -- FOR A FINANCIAL AID INITIATIVE. I WOULD PROVIDE FOR A HALF MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THEN THE SCHOOLS BEGINNING TO SPEND THOSE FUNDS ARE BEGINNING IN [inaudible] NINETEEN TWENTY AND THIS FUNDING DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON HIS TEAM'S OVERALL OPERATIONS ITS ITS PROGRAMMATIC IN NATURE -- BUT THE FUNDS -- SKEW THE NUMBERS SOMEWHAT SO IN OUR ANALYSIS WE REVIEW WE REMOVE THOSE -- FUNDS AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT IN NINETEEN TWENTY HASTINGS PROJECTS WILL ACTUALLY START REDUCING ITS DEFICIT RATHER THAN INCREASING AS THE TABLE MIGHT SUGGEST. AT FIRST GLANCE.% THE SCHOOL IS REDUCING ITS DEFICIT PRIMARILY BY REDUCING -- TUITION DISCOUNTING -- IT HAD INCREASED TUITION DISCOUNTING A FEW YEARS AGO AND THAT'S WHAT ORIGINALLY I WAS A KEY FACTOR THAT LED TO THE BUDGET DEFICIT. AND THE SCHOOL HAS A LONG TERM PLAN. TO ADDRESS ITS DEFICIT AND SO THE QUESTION BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS IS THE COMMITTEE COMFORTABLE THAT PLAN WHAT STEPS IS THE SCHOOL IT EXPECTED TAKE IN THE FUTURE. AND IS IT IS A FAST ENOUGH WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER PROGRESS OR IS IT DOES THAT SEEM ABOUT RIGHT. NOW IN ADDITION TO THAT DURING THE DEFICIT NUMBERS THAT THOSE NUMBERS ALSO SKEW THE RESERVE NUMBERS A BIT. I'M WHEN WE REVIEWED WHEN WE WROTE. YOU KNOW A FACTORED OUT THAT THAT INITIATIVE FUNDING OTHER RESERVES WENT DOWN AND EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE SCHOOL ANTICIPATED. TO SPEND ALL OF ITS OPERATING RESERVE AND WOULD START COVERING OF THE REMAINING DEFICIT IN OPERATIONS FROM ITS MAINTENANCE RESERVE. NOW THE SCHOOL IN OUR OFFICE HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON HOW TO INTERPRET THIS. THE SCHOOL MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCHOOLS PERSPECTIVE IS THAT -- IT FEELS THAT BECAUSE THE MAINTENANCE RESERVE IS FUNGIBLE WITH THE OPERATING RESERVE -- IT'S A BIT ARBITRARY -- TO DESIGNATE ONE FUNDING OR THE OTHER AND AND THE TOTAL RESERVES COMBINED AREON RESTRICTED AND SO THE SCHOOL HAS COMPLETE. ABILITY TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO COVER ITS DEFICIT. WHERE WE HAVE A BIT MORE CONCERN WITH THIS APPROACH -- WHAT WHAT WE FOUND IN THE PAST IS THE ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH MAINTENANCE BACKLOGS GROW? AT STATE AGENCIES IS WHEN THEY START USING FUNDS THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR MAINTENANCE TOWARDS OTHER BUDGETARY PRIORITIES. AND SO THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL WILL HAVE TO START A SPENDING DOWN ITS MAINTENANCE RESERVE. A WE THINK. RAISES FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT'S IT'S IT'S TAKE DOING ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THIS DEFICIT. NO REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL OTHER COMMITTEE MIGHT ALSO WONDER WELL WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF A HAZING FACILITIES TO DATE ARE THEY IN GOOD SHAPE ARE THEY IN BAD SHAPE. AND OUR VIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY AND AND RELATIVELY BETTER SHAPE THAN OTHER STATE AGENCIES YOU MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED IN IN YOUR HEARINGS. AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE THE STATE HAS ADDRESS THIS BACKLOG AYE THROUGH NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS SO THE SCHOOL HAS TO FACILITIES. OF THOSE WHO WANT ONE IS WHAT IS SLATED TO BE REPLACED FROM AN WITH A NEW BUILDING THAT WILL COME ONLINE SOON THAT WAS FUNDED BY THE STATE A FEW YEARS AGO. THE SECOND BUILDING HAS RECEIVED SOME FUNDING FOR PROJECTS AND IT'S LARGELY ADDRESS A LOT OF ITS BACKLOG. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE -- SIX AND YOU'LL SEE A TABLE THERE THAT SHOWS HE THINGS. ESTIMATE OF BACKLOG TODAY. AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE SCHOOL HAS STARTED TO INCLUDE IN ITS MAINTENANCE WAS PROJECTS THAT. THE STATE SOMETIMES CONSIDERS TO BE LOWER PRIORITY SO THINGS LIKE CARPET REPLACEMENT'S ENTER YOUR PAINTING. THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ARE. SCHEDULED TO HAPPEN BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY CRITICAL -- BUILDING OPERATIONS PROJECTS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE ANOTHER AGENCIES THAT ARE IN MUCH FIFTH HAVE FACILITIES WITH MUCH WORSE CONDITION. SO THAT THE ISSUE FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IN THE CASE OF HASTINGS IS -- TO SOME EXTENT PAYING DOWN THE BACKLOG BUT ULTIMATELY THE THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS HOW WILL THE SCHOOL -- ADDRESS MAINTENANCE IN THE FUTURE SO THAT FIFTEEN YEARS FROM NOW IT WILL BE ABLE TO START. OF FUNDING MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WITH ITS NEW BUILDING. I'M SO GIVEN THE OUR ANALYSIS OF THE CURRENT BACKLOG IN THE FACT THAT THE SCHOOL HAS MAINTENANCE RESERVES WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSED A ONE TIME FUNDING FOR MAINTENANCE AND DIRECT THE SCHOOL INSTEAD TO FUND THESE REMAINING. OF PROJECTS FROM ITS MAINTENANCE RESERVE. AND THEN MOVING FORWARD WE ALSO RECOMMEND AS WE DO IN THE CASE OF UC AND CSU. TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN TO ADDRESS ITS MAINTENANCE BACKLOG -- OBVIOUSLY THAT AGAIN THE CONSIDERATION HEARD BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT -- THERE THERE'S SOME BACKLOG WE NEED TO BE PAID DOWN BUT ULTIMATELY THAT PLAN WOULD WOULD -- DEVELOP OF A WAY FOR THE SCHOOL TO SET ASIDE FUNDING EACH YEAR SO THAT WHEN MEANS PROJECTS PROJECTS ARE SCHEDULED HAS FUNDING TO TO UNDERTAKE THOSE PROJECTS. THANK YOU ONE HAS TO QUESTION LET ME ASK A QUESTION. YOU PROBABLY COVER THIS AND IN YOUR BEGINNING AND SLID RIGHT BY MY OLD BRAIN BUT OUR ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE TASTINGS WILL BEGIN TO TAP ITS. MAINTENANCE RESERVE. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND HAVE THREE POINT NINE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE CHART THAT I JUST RECEIVED SO WAS THERE AND A NEW ANALYSIS OR THE ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE IS THAT I FOR OUR ANALYSIS WE EXCLUDED THAT DIVERSITY PIPELINE INITIATIVE. THAT'S WHAT SKEWS THE NUMBERS FOR ACTUALLY SO THE TOTAL MAINTENANCE BACKLOG HASTINGS IS ONE WHAT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. THAT THE CHURCH -- WHICH YEAR. WELL I'M LOOKING AT HASTINGS REPORTED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG KANE HOLE -- YES I'M SORRY THAT'S RIGHT. I DON'T HEAR ANYBODY TALK ABOUT SEISMIC WHAT'S THIS. ZERO IS THERE A ANALYSIS OF SEISMIC ISSUES YOU KNOW YOU'RE GETTING  NEW BUILDING SO PRESUMABLY WE'VE TAKEN. CARE OF SEISMIC WITH THAT I HOPE WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE WELL YOU ASSN. EXCELLENT QUESTION -- MY AGAIN DAVID SEWER IN THE CFO OF HASTINGS. OF THE SCHOOL HAS ITS CAMPUS IS IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE. A BUILDINGS THAT ARE YOU. STE STATE SUPPORTED SUPPORT THE SCHOOLS EDUCATIONAL MISSION. AND THEN WE HAVE BUILDINGS THAT. ARE EXHILARATING REPRISES STUDENT HOUSING PERFECT EARLY. OF WITH THE STATE SUPPORT FOR THE REPLACEMENT ACADEMIC BILLION GOLDEN GATE AVENUE WE WILL HAVE SIZABLE THE UPGRADE ALL OF OUR STATE SUPPORTED BUILDINGS. OF THE BUILDING. THE TWO HUNDRED MCALLISTER ST RECEIVED THE SEISMIC UPGRADE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN WHICH IS ALSO LESS THAN WE REPLACE THE CARPETING IN. THAT BUILDING -- BUT OF GREATER CONCERN AND WHICH REALLY THE DRAG A DRIVER OF OUR LONG RANGE CAMPUS PLAN IS THE CRITICALITY. OF ADDRESSING SEISMIC ISSUES AT OUR STUDENT HOUSING FACILITY THEY MAY BUILDINGS CONSTRUCTED IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY NINE WE ARE EMBARKING ON A PLAN WHICH ARE BEING FAKE WE CAN DESCRIBE MORE ARTICULATELY. THAT WILL CREATE NEW STUDENT HOUSING TO ALLOW US TO VACATE THE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE STRUCTURE. SHIFT THE HEAD COUNT INTO THE TO BE DEVELOPED BUILDING WHICH WERE IN DEVELOPMENT NOW OF AND THEN ALLOW FOR THE ULTIMATE REHABILITATION OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY NINE I RISE. SO THE THE SEISMIC OF NEEDS OF HASTINGS AS WELL AS THE UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA WRIT LARGE. ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT IT REALLY HOW ONE ADDRESSES THAT IS A FUNCTION OF IF IT'S IN A STATE SUPPORTED BUILDING OR IN IT AND BUT BUILDING CARE TRIES ANOTHER AS LONG AS HILLARY -- ENTERPRISE OR EXTRAMURAL AND HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING. WELL WITH LIBERTY AND NOW IF THERE WOULD BE THE ISSUANCE OF TAX EXEMPT THAT. THE HASTINGS HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ISSUE -- BONDS. THOSE BONDS WOULD BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THE REVENUES AT THE STUDENT HOUSING GENERATES. AND AND AND SO THE REVENUE BONDS YES THE SETTLERS YES SO THEN HOW WHAT YOUR TIME LINE. WELL. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT WAS? WHAT IS THE LIST OF BROAD QUESTION YEAH I'M HAVING? FUN DOLLARS OVER THE VOTE FOR THE RE HAVE -- IT WOULD PROBABLY EVER HER EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE WHICH IS THE NEW BUILDING WILL BE A THREE HUNDRED MILLION YES. OKAY SO WHAT WHAT WE WILL BE WHAT'S THE NEW ACADEMIC BUILDING IS ON LINE THAT WAS FUNDED. BY THE STATE -- THAT WILL BE READY OF OCCUPANCY AROUND DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR -- WE THEN PLAN TO HAND OVER THE OLD ACADEMIC BUILDING WHICH IS A FOUR STORY BUILDING -- TO OUR CONTRACTOR WHICH IS QUITE CONSTRUCTION -- AROUND APRIL TWENTIETH -- TWENTY TWENTY THEY HAVE A TWO YEAR CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULE -- SO WE HOPE THAT WILL BE OPEN FOR BUSINESS JUNE -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT BUILDING I WILL BE FOURTEEN STORIES TALL -- TO HAVE THAT SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY SUBSIDIZE STUDENT UNITS -- IN THOSE UNITS WILL BE SHARED BETWEEN UC HASTINGS AND YOU SEE SAN FRANCISCO -- AND IT'LL BE GREAT EXPANDING -- WHAT I'D CALL GRADUATE ACADEMIC VILLAGE IN THE HEART OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN WILL VACATE THE TWENTY SEVEN STORY -- HOUSING STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE WHICH IS SEISMIC WE CHALLENGE -- AND THAT WILL BE COMPLETELY RENOVATED -- WITH THE EXPECTATION BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ENDING AND JUNE -- TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GO FROM HOUSING AROUND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY GRADUATES USE ON CAMPUS HOUSING OVER A THOUSAND GRADUATE STUDENTS ON CAMPUS -- WHICH OF COURSE IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- IS A GREAT. BENEFIT. NOT ONLY TO YOU CASF AND HASTINGS -- BUT ALSO TO THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I DIDN'T MEAN TO GET YOU ALL OF TRACK WITH MY QUESTION BUT IS SORT OF TIED INTO WHAT THE LA -- WAS TALKING ABOUT SO I THOUGHT I'D JUMP ON SEISMIC IN THE BUILDING ISSUES. SURE SO ARE I WILL OF JUST BEGIN BY SAYING HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS OF COURSE -- THAT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET -- THE OVERALL -- GENERAL INCREASE WILL ALLOW US TO GO INTO AN EIGHTH YEAR WITHOUT TUITION -- RAISE ANY TUITION OF RAISING FOR THE STUDENTS -- AND OF COURSE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OUR BUILDINGS -- IN GOOD WORKING ORDER -- HOW DID pTHE STATE -- THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR THEIR SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS -- THEY DIDN'T ALLOCATE FUNDS THAT ALLOW US TO BUILD A BRAND NEW ACADEMIC BUILDING WHICH IS BEING BUILT ON CURRENTLY ON AN EMPTY LOT -- AND THEN LAST YEAR -- THROUGH AFTER THE INITIATIVE OF SOME OF THE PORTANTINO -- WE WERE PROVIDED WITH A PUT DIVERSITY PIPE BY GRANT TO CREATE -- CALIFORNIA SCHOLARSHIP FOR GRADUATES OF THE H. B. C. USE THIS WILL BE THE FIRST YEAR THAT THAT -- GRANT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED -- AND WE HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL BE AN EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED BY THE H. B. C. USE -- NATIONALLY. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE THE DISCOUNTING PRACTICES THAT SET OUT IN THE IN THE OUTLINE IS IS I GUESS SECOND YES. PRELIMINARY STREAM OF CONSCIOUS QUESTIONS I MEAN IS THIS COMMON IN. LAW SCHOOL BUSINESS THESE DAYS AND I NOTICED IT'S NOT NEED BASED ITS ITS MERIT BASED SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY IN THE FORM OF A SCHOLARSHIP BUT WE CALL IT A DISCOUNT I GUESS. SO YEAH -- FOR FOLLOWING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT A REALLY AROUND -- TWENTY TEN THE APPLICATION POOL DECREASED BY AS MUCH AS 40% NATIONALLY. AND SO THAT RAISE THE COMPETITIVENESS -- FOR QUALIFIED APPLICANTS TO LAW SCHOOL AND LAW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN PARTICULAR IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS THE NEW UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SYSTEM BUT ALSO -- PEPPER NINE CHAT MEN WILL LOS ANGELES SOUTHWESTERN -- THE VERY SCHOOLS BEGAN -- TO THEY CALL THE SCHOLARSHIP MONEY WAS ACTUALLY TUITION DISCOUNTING WE WENT -- IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE MARKETPLACE FROM AROUND THE 25230% DISCOUNT I WHICH WAS THE ORDINARY I THINK MOST SCHOOLS FALL THAT -- TO AROUND 42405% DISCOUNTING OVER THE YEARS FROM AROUND -- TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OTHER SCHOOLS INCLUDING -- OUR SISTER SCHOOLS LIKE DAVIS AND IRVINE I HAD DISCOUNT RATES ABOUT 505560% AWAY -- ESSENTIALIST SO -- IS IN THE 65270% TUITION DISCOUNTING A RANGE -- AND THEY ARE LARGELY BEING SUPPORTED BY THEIR CAMPUSES SO ONE OF OUR DISADVANTAGES AS A STANDALONE -- HAS BEEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CENTRAL CAMPUS TO HELP SUBSIDIZE -- THAT -- TUITION DISCOUNTING OF COURSESTUDENTS BENEFIT -- FROM SOME TUITION DISCOUNTING BECAUSE TUITION IS QUITE EXPENSIVE THESE DAYS BUT IT'S NOT REALLY A SUSTAINABLE MODEL AND WE HAVE SEEN APPLICATIONS STARTING TO RISE -- NOT TO THE LEVELS PRIOR -- TO TWENTY TWELVE BUT I THINK THAT THAT STARTING TO EVEN OUT AND I THINK SCHOOLS GENERALLY FOLLOWING. THE TREND THAT WE ARE WHICH IS TO RATCHET BACK -- A PART IT IS OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET SO WE'RE NOW IN WITH THIS YEAR WE RATCHET BACK TO OUR HISTORICAL NORM -- BUT WE HAVE A TAIL BECAUSE THE SECOND YEAR STUDENTS THE THIRD YEAR STUDENTS GOT THE DISCOUNT OF THAT 42405% SO UNTIL THEY'VE GRADUATED -- IT'S A COUPLE OF YEARS TO GET BACK TO OUR HISTORICAL MEMBERS. WELL I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THEN WHEN MY FRIENDS IN ACADEMIA PUSH BACK ON SO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT TO START ANOTHER LAW SCHOOL. IS NOT A GOOD MARKET -- TO SO THE THING YES IT'S POLITICALLY -- THIN ICE FROM YOU TO TAKE A STAND ON THAT. I DO AGREE WITH YOU THAT -- RIGHT NOW THE LAW SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SEEM TO BE A SEVEN THE MARKET WELL IF -- THERE WAS AN ISSUE FOR ME -- IT WOULD BE MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS TO GO INTO PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC INTEREST. HAVE THE SUPPORT TO LAW SCHOOL AND THROUGH -- SOME SORT OF FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS WE DO HAVE AND ARE ACTIVE IN PI CAP AND OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY -- FORGET IS -- ANY LOANS ARE NOT PAID BACK AFTER TEN YEARS AND MAY BE UP FOR THE TIME BEING EXACTLYTHEY SAY THEY'RE GOING TO RIGHT HAVEN'T SEEN VERY MANY RIGHT YEAH YEAH EXACTLY SO JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR ME -- BECAUSE I'M CURIOUS HOW DO YOU WHO GETS THE DISCOUNTS HOW DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A CUT LINE I MEAN IS IT BASED ON YOUR LSAT SCORES AND YOUR GPA IT'S A MIXTURE -- SO WE DO HAVE NEEDS BASED -- AND ABOUT 85290% OF OUR STUDENTS ARE NEEDS BASED -- BASED ON FASTER AND AND OTHER -- STANDARD -- METRICS -- SO EVEN WHEN THEY GET MERIT BASED SCHOLARSHIPS THE VERY OFTEN -- NEEDY STUDENTS IN ANY CASE -- BUT WE DO OF USE IT STRATEGICALLY -- TO TRY TO ATTRACT STUDENTS WITH HIGHER LCTS AND HIGHER GPA IS PART OF THE ARMS RACE QUITE FRANKLY IS HOW WE ARE RANKED BY. U. S. NEWS THIS AND SO STUDENTS ARE MAKING JUDGMENTS SUPPORTERS ARE MAKING JUDGMENTS -- BASED ON THE PROCEEDS ARE STATUS OF THE SCHOOL AND BECAUSE US NEWS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT -- CITY IN GPA -- IT HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON THE SORT OF SPIRALING IN THE FUTURE -- WHAT LEVEL STUDENT YOU CAN ATTRACT TO YOUR SCHOOL? THREE DO YOU IN -- IF YOU DECLARE WILL SAY JUST TO ADD TO THAT THE GERMAN ROUTE THEN. WE ALSO USE IT TO ATTRACT PROGRAM CALLED OTHER LEGAL AND EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM WE ARE -- AND WE OP IS DIRECTED WE BASICALLY MAINTAIN 20% OF OUR SLT SO WHERE ACTUAL OVER 20% OFF FOR THE INCOMING CLASS -- TO ADMIT STUDENTS -- FROM CALIFORNIA THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED AND HAVE OVERCOME DISADVANTAGE AND NOW -- PRESENT GOOD AS GOOD PROSPECT FOR LAW SCHOOL THEY TYPICALLY ON AVERAGE HAVE LOWERED -- CITIES IN GPAS BUT AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION WE OUT THIS YEAR TO TURN FIFTY YEARS OLD ARE COMMON HARRIS WAS A WE HAVE GRADUATE -- AND WE'RE VERY JEFF ADACHI -- IT DOUBLE -- FEDERAL JUDGE ROLE WE HAVE GRADUATES AND TO A VERY PROUD OF THE PROGRAM AND IT REALLY DOES GIVE A TRUE OPPORTUNITY TO STUDENTS WHO HAVE FACED DISADVANTAGE -- PRIOR TO GETTING TO ALL SCHOOL DO YOU DO YOU MAINTAIN STATISTICS ON THE DISCOUNTING PROGRAM AND IT NEVER IS. CATEGORIES OF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF INDIVIDUALS WE DIRECTED BY THE EEKEND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE IF YOU HAPPEN TO PROVIDE THIS DATA ABSOLUTELY. THE REALLY QUESTIONS NO. JUST LOOK AT BUT NOT RIGHT NOW THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS A PROMINENT LAWYER SONS SO. IN HIGH PLACES NOW. WELL I HAVE NO QUESTIONS SO I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OFTEN APPRECIATE THAT I CUT YOU OFFICER PHOTO NARAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION ON THE SEISMIC ISSUE I THINK THAT'S A NOT JUST YOU SEE BUT TO SEE ISSUE AND I HEAR VERY LITTLE ABOUT. SEISMIC IN SO -- EYES. I'M GONNA START ASKING ABOUT WELL WHEN WE ARE COMPLETED WITH OUR LONG RANGE CAMPUS PLAN THE ACADEMIC VILLAGE 1100% OF THE CAMPUS WILL HAVE BEEN SEISMICALLY UPGRADED. YOUR STATE AND NON STATE. AND WILL BE IN MODERN COAL COMPLAINTS THAT WILL BE WILL MAINTAIN GOING. FOR YOU. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ITEMS SIXTY ONE TWENTY CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY THERE ARE THREE ISSUES WE'LL START WITH ISSUE TO ZIP BOOKS. SO. HOW ARE YOU SIR THANK YOU? I'M GREAT. HAVE YOU INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR. CHRISTOPHER EXAM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MONEY. JUSTIN CONCENTRATION DALY AGAIN. LOCUSTS FROM THE STATE LIBRARY. THANK YOU FOR HAVING FOR BEING HERE. WHO WANTS TO START? SURE. THE CALIFORNIA STATE LIBRARY SERVES A CRITICAL ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT BY SERVING AS THE CENTRAL REFERENCE AND RESEARCH LIBRARY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. ADDITIONALLY THE STATE LIBRARY PROVIDES CRITICAL ASSISTANCE AND DISTRIBUTES FEDERAL FUNDING TO THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS. AND NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A ONE TIME -- INVESTMENT IN THESE BOOKS PROGRAM OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- GENERAL FUND. THE PROGRAM ENABLES A WITHOUT FURTHER ACCESS TO BOOKS AND LIBRARY MATERIALS -- THROUGHOUT -- DIGITAL -- INFRASTRUCTURE SO IT CERTAINLY ENABLE SAP PATRONS -- TO HAVE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO BOOKS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN AT THEIR LOCAL LIBRARY [inaudible] HELLO. TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT ON A WHAT THE FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT ON OF THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS IS A PATRON AT A LIBRARY REQUESTS A BOOK. THE LIBRARY THEN. AS AN ESTABLISHED LINE OF CREDIT THE RAMS ON AND PURCHASED THE PURCHASES THE BOOK ON BEHALF OF THE PATRON AND THE STATE. ULTIMATELY PAYS FOR THE BOOK. THE BOOK IS DELIVERED TO THE PATRON THE PATRON USES THE BOOK RETURNS IT TO THE LIBRARY AND AT THAT POINT THE LIBRARY EITHER DECIDES TO MAINTAIN THE BOOK KEEP IT OR ARE TO SELL THROUGH ITS FOUNDATION. THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY OVERSEEN BY NORTH NET WHICH IS A LIBRARY COOPERATIVE SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND ACCORDING THE STATE LIBRARY NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE ONE MILLION WOULD BE SPENT ON BOOK PURCHASES ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND BUCKS ESTIMATES. THE REMAINING HUNDRED THOUSAND WOULD BE SPENT ON NORTH NOTES ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. WE REVIEW THIS PROPOSAL -- WE FOUND THAT THAT ONE OF THE OVER ARCHING GOALS OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ENSURE THAT -- RURAL LIBRARIES WITH RELATIVELY FEW RESOURCES. I CAN MEET PATRON REQUESTS FOR LIBRARY RESOURCES. AND THAT OVERARCHING GOAL IS SOMETHING THAT IS BEEN A LONG ESTABLISHED GOLDEN STATE LAW. WE'RE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT THE PROPOSAL LACKED A COUPLE OF KEY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN IT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. A WALK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE -- ISSUES. OF THE FIRST IS THAT THE THE PROPOSAL ITSELF DIDN'T FULLY ARTICULATE -- THE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM SO THERE WAS NO DATA FOR EXAMPLE ON A WHICH LIBRARIESHAVE DIFFICULTY MEETING PATRON REQUEST WHICH LIBRARIES ARE RELATIVELY UNDER RESOURCE. AND THOSE DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF HE CURRENT PROGRAM IS WAS TARGETED ADEQUATELY. A WE DID FIND THAT FROM SOME HISTORICAL INFORMATION. BUDGET DATA FOUND THAT -- THE LIBRARIES ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM THEY SPENT ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THEIR LOCAL RESOURCES TO REQUIRE PRINT MATERIALS. THAT'S FAR IN EXCESS OF WHAT THE STATE -- IS ABOUT PROVIDING FOR THE BOOKS PROGRAM ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS ACROSS ALL OF THE LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS SOME OF THEM HAVE A OF MATERIALS ACQUISITION BUDGET OF ZERO AND SOME OF THEM HAVE. LARGER ACQUISITION BUDGET SO -- IT JUST A QUESTION OF WHICH OF THESE LIBRARIES ARE AT HIGHEST NEED. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSAL WERE OTHER ALTERNATIVES -- TO THE BOOKS THAT COULD HELP ROLE LIBRARIES ME PATRON DEMAND FOR EXAMPLE A BETTER USING ELECTRONIC RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE A RATHER THAN PRINT MATERIALS. AND THEN FINALLY ON THERE ARE% SOME BASIC INFORMATION THAT WE HAD REQUESTED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON HISTORICAL SPENDING IN FUNDING IN THE PROGRAM IN WHICH LIBRARIES HAVE RECEIVED A BOOK PURCHASES AND HOW MANY BOOKS HAVE BEEN PURCHASED SO FAR. AND WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON THAT REQUEST WE HAVEN'T. SEEN THE DATA YET AND SO WE CAN'T COMMENT ON WHETHER THE PROJECTED SIXTY THOUSAND BUCKS IS IN LINE WITH WHAT THE PROGRAM HAS SEEN THUS FAR AND IF THERE'S ANY. SO SOMEBODY COLLECTING DATA. A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT NORTH NET WHICH OVERSEES THE PROGRAM GATHERS DATA AND SUBMITS A TO THE STATE LIBRARY -- WHERE WE'VE BEEN WORKING AGAIN WITHIN MINISTRATION ON ON THAT THEY INDICATED THAT THEY COULD GET US SOME INFORMATION BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET SO IT'S JUST A MATTER OF? OF GETTING AT THIS POINT SO WE CAN REVIEW IT. WE HAVE A PROBLEM GETTING THE BOOKS BACK INTO THE LIBRARY SYSTEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE BOOKS GENERALLY ARE RETURNED TO THE LIBRARY SYSTEM SOME LIBRARIES HAVE A DIFFICULTY -- TRACKING THE BOOKS SO IF THEY DON'T OF BAR CODED PROPERLY IS SOMETIMES IT MIGHT GET LOST WITH THEIR OTHER BOOKS AND SO THERE'S SOME. THERE'S SOME DATA ISSUES THERE WITH WITH TRACKING WHETHER OR NOT THE BOOKS ARE RETURNED MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST OF THE BOOKS ARE RETURNED THERE ARE SOME THAT THAT MAY NOT GET RETURN BUT THAT DUTCH BASED ON A REVIEW THAT WAS DONE OF THE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO. CLICK AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM. STATE LIBRARIAN -- I'M SORRY I'M TO GIVE A RECOMMENDED WITH A RECOMMENDATION THAT I WALK YOU THROUGH AND I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT REALLY CUT YOU -- BUDGET JUST A RECOMMENDATION THERE ON WE WE HAD RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE GET AN IMPROVED PLAN FIRST FOR THOSE OF BOOKS PROPOSAL THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD. BECAUSE THE LARGEST BECAUSE IT FOR TWO WEEKS AWAY FROM THE MAY REVISION -- IT'S IT'S UNLIKELY WE GET OUT OF AN UPDATED AND PER PLAN IN THAT TIME TO BE IN REASONABLE FOR THE CELEBRITY DEVELOP THAT PLANTS THE LEGISLATURE HAS TWO OPTIONS. ONE IS TO REQUEST ADMINISTRATION COME BACK NEXT YEAR ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS AND CONDITION THE RELEASE ON THOSE FUNDS ON ON GETTING -- SOME MORE INFORMATION AND HAVING A SORT OF DEAL BE SEE REVIEW PROCESS. SUCH THE RECOMMENDATION WE HAD THANK YOU. WELL I WOULD ASSUME THAT. IT WILL BE SOMEBODY WILL BE COLLECTING SOME DATA AND CRUNCHING SOME NUMBERS. MAKING SURE THAT THE PRO PROGRAM IS THE MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY BUT IT IT SEEMS SORT OF INNOVATIVE TO ME WE'RE NOT APPROVING ANYTHING TODAY TO HOLD OPEN ITEM BUT THANK YOU. SIR SAID SINCE YOU'RE HOLDING THE ITEM OPENID WOULD THANK YOU FOR THAT AND TALKED AFTER THE MAY REVISION. I WANNA HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION OR I THINK IF YOU KNOW A BOOK ANYTHING ELSE IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT'S AN INNOVATIVE PROGRAM IF IT SERVES PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TROUBLE GETTING TO LIBRARIES AND SECURING BOOKS AND WE SEEM TO GET THE BOOKS. BACK INTO THE SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT KNOW CATTY CORNER FROM YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE HE WALKED TO THE MAIN LIBRARY RIVERSIDE USES THAT MAKE HIM RIGHT AND WHAT GIVE YOU CHAPTER AND VERSE ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE POPULARITY THAT IT HAS. BUT I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY TO YOU KNOW QUANTIFY THE EFFECT YEAH PROGRAM OVER TIME AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE NEXT TIME AROUND FOR SURE. IF NOT BEFORE YEAH IT'S BEEN INTERESTING FOR HOW HUGE -- AS AMAZON IS -- THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH LARGE GROUP CLIENTS AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE. I MEAN IT'S A LONGER DISCUSSION BUT IT'S AN ISSUE WE'RE WORKING ON THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THE EASIER. COLLECTION OF THE DATA WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE HANDS ON PERFECT. TELL YOU ANY QUESTIONS. NOT LET'S MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER THREE LUNCH AT THE LIBRARY. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES ONE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT THE LUNCH AT THE LIBRARIES PROGRAM -- THESE -- INVESTMENTS ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE LOCAL LIBRARIES TO DRAW DOWN -- FEDERAL -- FUNDING TO SUPPORT AT SUMMER LUNCH PROGRAMS TO THE LIBRARY -- THIS WAS FIRST FUNDED -- IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET WHAT THEY ONE MILLION ONE TIME AUGMENTATION AS WELL [inaudible] HELLO. OUR SYSTEM THE RECOMMENDATION IS GOING TO SOUND SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS ITEM. FOR SOME FURTHER CONTEXT AND WHAT WHAT THE STATE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR THIS PROPOSAL AS PART OF A LARGER FEDERAL PROGRAM. THAT PROVIDES FREE MEALS TO STUDENTS IN THE SUMMER AND THE OVERARCHING PURPOSE OF THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM IS TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZE MEALS IN THE SUMMER -- BECAUSE THEY'RE OTHERWISE NOT ATTENDING SCHOOL WHERE THEY RECEIVED. A SUBSIDIZED MEAL DURING THE FALL THROUGH SPRING. THE FEDERAL PROGRAM ITSELF FUNDS THE MEALS AND SO THE STATE FUNDING HERE. RATHER THAN FOR THE MEALS ARE OR FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THOSE -- MEALS SO FOR EXAMPLE A PORTION OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE FOR STAFF TIME TO TO PROVIDE OUTREACH AND SUPPORT TO LIBRARIES. WHO WANT? TO BECOME PART OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM ANOTHER PORTION OF THE FUNDING WOULD. PROVIDE STARTUP FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES THAT WANT TO BECOME SITES TO PROVIDE MEALS ANOTHER PERSON THE FUNDING WOULD ALSO SUPPORT I'M VERY SUMMER ENRICHMENT PROGRAMS FOR STUDENTS THAT. ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM WHEN THEY ALSO WHEN THEY RECEIVE A FREE MEAL AT A LIBRARY. IN REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL WE THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS IDENTIFIED A CEILING ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHICH IS -- FOR A FOOD AND SECURITY AMONG CHILDREN IN THE STATE. DATA SUGGESTS THAT ABOUT 19% OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY WHAT THE RATES UP. BIG TENDING TO BE HIGHER IN IN THE INLAND PARTS OF THE STATE VERSUS -- THE MORE URBAN PARTS. I'M. IN TERMS IT WITH THEIR ISN'T DATA ON THE SEASONALITY OF THAT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FOOD SECURITY INCREASES IN THE SUMMER WHEN STUDENTS AREN'T IN SCHOOL AND NOT RECEIVING A FREE MEAL. WE ALSO. UNDERSTAND THAT BY TRYING TO LEVERAGE MORE FUNDING THROUGH THE SUMMER MEAL PROGRAM IN ORDER TO ADDRESS FOR IN SECURITY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND STATE LIBRARY. IS TRYING TO LEVERAGE MORE FEDERAL FUNDS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WE ALSO THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE APPROACH. OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT BY FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON ON FEDERATION NEW LIBRARY SITES. THE PROPOSAL IS SOMEWHAT NARROW IN FOCUS A WEBER IS OR JUST A SUBSET OF PROVIDERS THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. OUR SCHOOLS ARE A KEY PROVIDER IN ADDITION OF NON PROFITS IN OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES CAN SERVICE SITES. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THERE'S SOME THERE'S MANY FACTORS THAT LIKELY EXPLAIN MY STUDENTS MAY NOT. RECEIVE A FREE MEAL IN THE SUMMER AND GO TO A SITE -- ONE OF THEM IS THAT THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH SITES ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE IN A RURAL AREA. THERE COULD BE OTHER FACTORS TO LIKE LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM -- WE THINK BY FOCUSING JUST ON WAIVERS AND JUST ON THE SITES THE DEMONSTRATIONS JUST FOCUSING ON ONE ON ONE PARTICULAR ISSUE AND NOT AT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM MORE HOLISTICALLY. SO WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN STATE LIBRARY TO WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE FEDERAL PROGRAM A IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEVELOP -- A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE THE PLAN WOULD PROPOSE ALWAYS TARGET RESOURCES IN REGIONS WHERE FOOD SECURITY IS HIGHER. IT WOULD INVITE ALL ENTITIES TO OF APPLY FOR THE FUNDING NOT JUST THE LIBRARIES FOR EXAMPLE BUT ALSO SCHOOLS NONPROFITS OTHER UP PROVIDERS WHO CAN SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. I WOULD ALSO IDENTIFY PLANNED IT TO TO TRACK DATA NOW COMES OVER TIME. NOW AS I AS I SAID IN THE BOOKS PROGRAM GIVEN THE SHORT TIME FRAME HERE IT PROBABLY THIS PLAN COVER PROBABLY CAN BE DEVELOPED -- BEFORE THE MAYOR VISION AND SO SIMILAR TO LAST PROPOSAL YOU HAVE THE OPTION OF OF ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION COME BACK NEXT YEAR OR CONDITIONING THE RELEASE OF THE FUNDING ON A MORE DEVELOPED PLAN AND NOVEMBER HAVING A SORT OF DEAL B. C. REVIEW. THANK YOU WELL I ASSUME THAT IN ADDITION TO FOOD. IN DEALING WITH FOOD AND SECURITY THAT THE PURPOSE HERE IS TO TRY TO GET YOUNG PEOPLE. INTO A LIBRARY AT A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THEY'RE NOT OTHERWISE IN A K. TO TWELVE PROGRAM AND EXPOSE THEM TO THE VARIOUS. WONDERS OF OF OF THE LIBRARY AND BOOKS AND READING AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITH. A LIBRARY MAYBE YOU COULD. THAT'S TRUE WHEN SENATOR SENATOR MITCHELL APPROACHED US WITH THIS IDEA LAST LAST YEAR -- IT WAS BECAUSE THERE'S I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW MANY BUT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE TWO THOUSAND OF THESE SITES WHERE YOU CAN GET MEALS IN THE SUMMER AND AND THE NUMBERS FALLING A LITTLE BIT. THE PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN. SERVING FREE LUNCHES IN THE SUMMER WHERE THERE'S BEEN AN UPTICK IN ATTENDANCE HAVE BEEN LIBRARIES. AND SO HER THINKING WAS ALL RIGHT IF WE CAN REDUCE SOME O THE BARRIERS TO GETTING MORE LIBRARIES TO DO THIS. THEN. EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY HAPPENS RIGHT YOU GO THERE FOR THE MEAL BUT YOU WALK OUT AND SIGN UP FOR SUMMER READING OR YOU LEAVE WITH. YOU KNOW ADD THAT'S EXTRA TO THE SIMPLY PROVIDING OF A MEAL. AND I'VE BEEN TO A FEW OF THESE ONE IN ONTARIO IN EAST PALO ALTO AND FOWLER. AND THE COMMUNITY SEEMS TO LIKE THE GROWERS AND FOWLER HAD PALLETS OF FOOD SO THE FAMILIES COULD. YOU KNOW AND THEY HAVE AN EXPERT AND GET A FREE MEAL WALK OUT AND TAKE SOME FRESH FOOD HOME WITH THEM. ONTARIO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO WALKED OUT OF THE DOOR AFTER THE MAIL WANTED TO KNOW WHERE TO SIGN UP FOR SUMMER READING I MEAN. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. AM I THINK I THINK SENATOR MITCHELL WOULD BE THE FIRST PERSON AND I WOULD ECHO WHAT. IS THAT THIS IS NOT THE ANSWER I MEAN ONE OUT OF FIVE KIDS I MEAN IT'S IT'S KIND OF SHOCKING ONE OUT OF FIVE KIDS OF GETS A FREE OR SUBSIDIZED MIL DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR GETS ONE IN THE SUMMER. AND THIS IS NOT GONNA. MAKE IT FIVE OUT OF FIVE BUT THIS WAS AN EFFORT. TO WHICH WHICH I THINK IS A VERY POSITIVE ONE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR LIBRARIES TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE AND FOR AN OFTEN THEIR PARTNERS ARE AS YOU SAY LIKE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE CLOSED AND IT'S LIKE HERE. WE'RE HANDING YOU THE BATON FOR THE SUMMER. AND AT THE SAME TIME I I WOULD NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS BUT SENATOR MITCHELL PUT A PROVISION IN THERE -- TOO OFFER THESE KIND OF MICROGRAMS TO LIBRARIES TO GO TO SOME OF THESE OTHER SITES RIGHT IF PEOPLE COME TO THE LIBRARY BECAUSE OF THE COOL STUFF THERE. WHY NOT ENCOURAGE LIBRARIES TO GO TO THESE OTHER SITES AND SEE IF THAT DOESN'T INCREASE THE IT TO PRESS A TO FOR YOU ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH FOOD AND SECURITY POLICE TO THE POPULATION YOU CAN REACH AND YOU ARE ABLE TO ALSO ADD THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT TO IT. AT THE SAME TIME IT PRECISELY AND THEN THERE'S A YOU KNOW A COMMAND TELLING WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY THERE ALL THESE STUDIES ABOUT SUMMER SLIDE AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND YOU KNOW HOW KIDS WHO DON'T -- ENGAGEIN THAT WAY DURING THE SUMMER -- START OFF BEHIND THEIR PEERS IN THE FALL WE'LL BE BRINGING THIS BACK FOR A VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] YES. I JUST HAVE TO YOU KNOW PUT MY STRONG SUPPORT OUT THERE FOR THE SUMMER LUNCH PROGRAM. I'VE BEEN TO THE ONTARIO ONE AS WELL AND AS SOMEONE WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES LIBRARIES I LOVE BOOKS BUT ALSO OUR LIBRARIES PROVIDE SO MUCH MORE INTERNET -- FOR SOME OF OUR OR THE INTERNET AND IT IS JUST A WIN WIN YOU COME YOU GET A MEAL A NUTRITIOUS MEAL OTHER FAMILIES ARE HAPPY TO BE THERE EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST STATED. AND THEY HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR LIBRARY IT HELPS PREVENT THE SUMMER SLIDE SO I WOULD JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT THAT WE KEEP THIS PROGRAM GOING AS THIS. BUT A WOULD AGREE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THAT. I MEAN IT'S WORTH HAVING. LARGER DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OKAY WHAT ARE THE OTHER PLAYERS IN THIS AND HOW CAN WE MAKE IT FIVE OUT OF FIVE OF THESE KIDS GETTING A MEAL IN THE SUMMER I AGREE OF WHICH I'M HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN IT. AT ANY TIME THAT IS YEAH I I AGREE IF WE CAN EXPAND THE PROGRAM THAT'S GREAT I JUST DON'T. EXPENSE OF THE THE SUMMER A LIBRARY LUNCH PROGRAM. AND YOUR LIBRARY DIRECTOR IN ONTARIO IS ONE OF THE MOST INNOVATIVE ONES IN THE STATE SO. NOW SHE IS ROCKING A AS IS YOURS SENATOR. THANK YOU ISSUE NUMBER. FOUR AB TWO TWO FIVE TO THE MALLS. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE INTERNET WEB. FOR CERTAINLY SAID THAT CHAPTER LEGISLATION ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWO FIVE FIVE TWO OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN REQUIRES THE STATE LIBRARY TO ESTABLISH A A WEB PORTAL -- FOR A STATE AGENCY GRANT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- IN RECOGNITION OF THAT LEGISLATION -- PROVIDE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND GENERAL FUND OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IS ONE TIME TO DEVELOP THE WEB PORTHOLE AS WELL AS WORK WITH STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE. ALL OF THE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES UP REFLECTED ON THAT WEBSITE. THANK YOU ILLEGAL. THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE WOULD RAISE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL. IS THE ONGOING NEED FOR STAFFING -- FOR THE PROJECT. THE LIMITED TERM WORKLOAD SEEMS TO BE THAT TO FULL TIME POSITIONS WOULD BE JUSTIFIED. THAT WORKLOAD INCLUDES OF THE LIBRARY GOING OUT AND REACHING AGREEMENTS WITH VERY STATE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY WHICH GRANT PROGRAMS ARE ELIGIBLE AND ALSO. TO ENSURE THAT THE WEB PORTAL CAN -- TALK TO THEIR IN RIGHT. INTERNET SYSTEMS AND IN ADDITION THE OF THE LIBRARY THAT HAS DEVELOPED THE WEB PORTAL AND THEN THE LIBRARIAN DISSIPATES IT WILL LIKELY HAVE TO MAKE SOME INTERPRETIVE IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME. THE BY THE SYSTEM PERHAPS IDENTIFY EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS. ALMOND SO THAT THAT WOULD LIMITED TERM WORKLOAD. SEEMS TO JUSTIFY TWO POSITIONS. WHAT'S THE WEB PORTAL BECOMES MORE AUTOMATED REFILL LIBRARIES SUCCESSFUL AND AUTOMATING THAT -- THAT CONTINUE NEED TO HAVE TWO FULL TIME POSITIONS -- WAS A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR TO US WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT A A A MORE RATIONAL WAY TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND THEN REVISIT THE WORKLOAD IN A FEW YEARS WELL ONCE THE LIBRARIES HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BUT THE WEB PORTAL ONLINE AND AND MAKE IT OR IF IT EVER IN A RIVER. PREVENTS. THE ONE ISSUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION REYES WHEN WE WHEN WE RAISES CONCERN WAS. THAT OTHERS ANECDOTAL EXPERIENCE THAT -- SIR AGENCIES THAT HAVE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS HAVE A HARD TIME FILLING THEM OR MAY HAVE VACANCY RATES. AND BECAUSE OF THE TIME LINES OF THIS PROJECT THE PROJECT AS THE LAW REQUIRES PROJECT BETWEEN COMPLETED BY THE END OF TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THAT COULD CREATE DELAYS THAT RESULT AND PERHAPS NOT MEETING THAT DEADLINE SO IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO TAKE THIS APPROACH OF PROVIDING LIMITED TERM FUNDING. WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND STATE LIBRARY TO ENSURE THAT ANY DEADLINES ARE ACHIEVABLE. THANK YOU. WELL THE JOB DESCRIPTIONS FOR THE TO STAFFERS. TO BE DIFFERENT ONE APPEARS TO BE. ACTUAL WEBSITE MAINTENANCE IN INTER OPERABILITY AND THE OTHER IS MORE SUBSTANTIVE. TYPE POSITION IS THAT IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING RIGHT MY UNDERSTANDING IS ONE POSITION WOULD BE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING THE STATE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE A MEETING WITH VERY STAKEHOLDERS -- SETTING UP THESE AGREEMENTS ON THE SECOND -- OF POSITION WOULD BE MORE FOCUSED ON THE I. T. SIDE OF IT SO THE STATE LIBRARY DISSIPATES CONTRACTING OUT. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WEBSITE BUT THEN TRAINING AND I A FULL TIME I. T. PERSON. TO DEAL WITH THAT DEAL WITH THE I. T. ASPECTS OF THIS AND AGAIN MAKE ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENTS DEBUGGED THE SYSTEM. AND THAT AND THAT'S THE SECOND POSITION. IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT YOU WERE GOING TO PROBABLY NEED TO HAVE BOTH POSITION IN ORDER TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING -- INTERNET WEB PORTAL THAT PROVIDES UP TO DATE. INFORMATION ABOUT GRANTS BUT WE CAN WE'LL REVISIT THIS SEVEN LATER. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING IT OPEN. HOLDING AN OPEN. AND THAT'S IT FOR THIS ITEM THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION ITEM SIX NINE EIGHT ZERO CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. FIRST ISSUE IS ISSUE NUMBER FIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS STUDENTS PARENTS. OKAY THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WOULD INTRODUCE YOURSELVES STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. GEN MERRY ARE WITH FINANCE. THANK YOU. HE THINKING LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DIVINE TO CALIFORNIA'S DO NEED COMMISSION TO BURN GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK OKAY LA -- YEAH. WRITE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE COW CAN SYSTEM IS CONTEXT FOR THE NEXT TWO ISSUES ON THE AGENDA REGARDING SKIN PARENTS AND COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. SECTIONS OF JUST DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT THAT WILL BE SPEAKING FROM. THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT THAT THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM IS QUITE A LONG HISTORY. THIS CREATED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AS THE STATE CONSOLIDATED SEVERAL EXISTING FINANCIALLY AND PROGRAMS. IT WAS LAST SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRUCTURED IN YEAR TWO THOUSAND WHICH IS WHEN THE STATE CREDIT THE ENTITLEMENT. COMPETITIVE PROGRAM WHICH WILL DISCUSS BRIEFLY. NEED HELP AND SPENDING TOTALS ABOUT TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS A COMBINATION OF STATE GENERAL FUND. AND FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT TENER FOR TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE. IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS IS THE VAST MAJORITY ABOUT 95% OF WHAT THE STUDENT COMMISSION SPENDS AND GRANT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS. IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE SEGMENTS TO PROVIDE SOME INSTITUTIONAL AND PROGRAMS THAT SUPPLEMENT CAL GRANT VARIOUS PLACE. INCLUDING PROVIDING AID FOR SOME STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONTENT OR HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY. AND IN SOME CASES PROVIDING ADDITIONAL ON TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR **** AND ACCEPTANCE. TO HAND OUT WE'VE SUMMARIZED HOW CAN AWARD AMOUNTS WHICH VERY QUITE A BIT DEPENDING ON THE WHITE. AB AND C.. AS WELL AS THE SEGMENT ATTENDANCE. FOR COUNTY RECIPIENTS STUDENTS RECEIVE FULL TUITION FEE COVERAGE AT THE PUBLIC STATEMENTS. AND AS THE STATE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF SUPPORTING COLLEGE TWICE KOKANEE RECIPIENTS TO ALSO RECEIVE A FIXED AMOUNT FOR TUITION AT THE PRIVATE SECONDS. HOW CAN BE RECIPIENTS RECEIVE A SIMILAR LEVEL OF TUITION ASSISTANCE IN ADDITION TO A NON TUITION AWARD CALLED THE AXIS AWARD? WHICH IS CURRENTLY WORTH ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. FINALLY CAO CAN'T SEE RECIPIENTS SEE THE SMALLER WORD WORTH ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS HERE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THIS WORD IS RESERVE SPECIFICALLY FOR THE STUDENTS PURSUING CREEK TECHNICAL EDUCATION. PAGE THREE WITH SUMMARIZE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR CAL GRANT. YOU'LL NOTICE THERE ARE NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS HERE INCLUDING NOT ONLY FINANCIAL NEEDS BUT ALSO FACTORS SUCH AS AGE TEN OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. GOOD POINT AVERAGE IN SOME CASES PROGRAM STUDY. GENERALLY SPEAKING THOUGH STUDENTS TO MEETING CERTAIN INCOME AND ASSETS. ALL OF MY FOR CONTENT. AND THEN BEYOND THAT THERE MAIN ROUTES THE WHICH THE MAJOR SUPPORT. THE FIRST IN LARGER PROGRAM IS CALLED ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND TRANSFER STUDENTS UNDER AGE. TWENTY EIGHT ARE ENTITLED TO WORK THROUGH THIS. AND FOR STUDENTS WHO DON'T NEED DOESN'T HEINEMANN PROGRAM CRITERIA STATE OFFERS A LIMITED NUMBER CURRENTLY JUST OVER. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMPETITIVE AWARDS WHICH GO TO A SMALL NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. FINALLY ON THE LAST PAGE OF OUR HAND OUT WE SUMMARIZE CONTENT SPENDING. I PROGRAM SEGMENT AWARD TYPE AN ELECTRONIC. CAROL JUST CALLING ATTENTION TO TWO MAIN POINTS THAT ARE SHADED INSPECTOR. FIRST TO SEE IN THE UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER THAT FOR THE MAJORITY WELL OVER 80% OF CAL GRANT SPENDING GOES FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM. ORDER STUDENTS FOR MORE THAN A FEW YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TO HAVE FEWER OPPORTUNITIES TO QUALIFY. FOR FINALLY IN THE LOWER RIGHT HAND CORNER. YOU ALSO SEE THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF **** AND SPENDING GOES TOWARD PUSH NORTH. LITTLE RELATIVELY SMALLER SHARE FOR NON TUITION COSTS SUCH AS FOOD AND HOUSING. BUT FOR MANY STUDENTS I COUNT THE MAJORITY OF THE TOTAL COST -- OVERVIEW OF CONTENTS AND HAPPY TO CAN COST. WHEN IT'S IN THE GOVERNMENT? NO OTHER THAN WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CASE ADJUSTMENTS THAT YOUR AGENDA NOTES [inaudible] OKAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. CERTAINLY SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A NEW NON TUITION GRANT TO ASSIST CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS WHO ARE STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AT A COST OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THESE NEW AWARDS WILL BE UP TO SIX THOUSAND FOR CAL GRANT A AND B. STUDENTS. REFLECTING AN INCREASE TO THE ACCESS A WAR THAT BE STUDENTS ALREADY RECEIVE AND UP TO FOUR THOUSAND FOR CAL GRANT SEE STUDENTS. THIS PROPOSAL IS GUIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL OF TACKLING INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY BY SUPPORTING STUDENT PARENTS IN THEIR PERSISTENCE IN HIGHER EDUCATION. HOW DID ANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HELLO. ONE OF YOUR TEN DAY YOU'LL SEE A TABLE THAT PROVIDES A PROFILE OF STUDENT PARENTS HER SEEKING HOW CAN. STUDENT PARENTS CURRENTLY COMPRISE ABOUT 9% OF CONTENT RECIPIENTS. AND YOU'LL SEE AT THE TOP OF THIS TABLE TO THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE SERVE THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE WHAT PROGRAM. THROUGH WHICH THEY BY FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF AWARDS. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES IDENTIFIED IMPORTANT AREAS NEED. A GROUP OF STUDENTS WHOSE FINANCIAL NEEDS MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATELY MET BY THE CURRENT SYSTEM. THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL AS IT'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. LISTED ON PAGE TWENTY TWO OF YOUR DONDE ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN THE PAGE. THE FIRST FOUR CONCERNS IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS IN THE PAST FEW YEARS INDICATEDAN INTEREST IN SIMPLIFYING THE HEALTH AND SYSTEM. IN STREAMLINING THE MANY DIFFERENT RULES COVERING ELIGIBILITY AND WHAT SITES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD RUN COUNTER TO THESE EFFORTS BY INTRODUCING A NEW SET OF RULES THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO ONE SUB A FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS. WE ALSO RELATED DISTRIBUTIONAL CONCERN. WHETHER STUDENT HAS CHILDREN SENT ME DOES THE FACT THEIR FINANCIAL NEED. BUT THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT SHAPE THE STUDENT'S OVERALL NEED INCLUDING THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME ASSETS IN. FIVE BY TARGETING ADDITIONAL AID ACCORDING TO ONE COMPONENT OF OVERALL NEED WE ARE CONSENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WITH ME ABOUT SOME STUDENTS WITH HIGH OVERALL. NEED. WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN? WHEN WE WERE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE ABOUT A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS PARENTS WITH FINANCIAL? THIS GOES BACK TO THE EARLIER POINT THAT MOST STUDENTS PARENTS ARE SIR AFTER THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. GIVEN THE COP ON COMPETITIVE AWARDS THIS MEANS THAT ONLY A MINORITY OF STUDENTS PARENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED ACTUALLY RECEIVE A CALL. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID TO THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR BUT NOT OFFERED CAL GRANT IT IS A LIMON UNCOMPETITIVE AWARD. IT ALSO WOULD NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID TO STUDENTS PARENTS WITH FINANCIAL NEED ATTENDING THE PRIVATE INSTITUTION. FOR THESE REASONS WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND THAT RAISES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS ARE ADEQUATELY MEETING THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO PURSUE FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS TOPIC. THAT WOULD REQUIRE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS THAT STUDENT PRINT SPACE BUT ALSO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS PARENTS BOTH THROUGH OUR STUDENT FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM. AND THROUGH OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR WELL GIVEN THE DELTA BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF APPLICANTS FOR THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IN THOSE IT ACTUALLY RECEIVE AN AWARD MY RECOLLECTION IS IT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND GIVE OR TAKE. DO WE KNOW IF WE TOOK THIS THE TOTAL MONEY THAT WE HAD. HAVE. LIED TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. AND WHAT AND WE APPLIED INSTEAD TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS SO MANY GRANTS THAT WOULD ADD. ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPETITIVE WORDS PROPOSAL THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING IN THE NEXT ISSUE. WE ESTIMATED THAT FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL ONE MILLION DOLLARS WE PUT INTO THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM. COULD RAISE THE CALIFORNIA WHERE I ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THAT BEING SAID AS THIS NEW AWARDS CONVERTER NOODLES THAT COST WOULD INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AND SO WE WOULD NEED. TO MORE THOUGHTFULLY MODEL THAT IF WE WERE TO PROPOSE SHIFTING THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION FROM THE STUDENT PARENTS PROPOSAL. DIRECTLY INTO THE COMPUTER PROGRAM SO IT'S ABOUT. FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FOR EVERY TEN MILLION. THAT'S RIGHT IF I WERE IF I KNEW MATH THERE WOULDN'T BE A LAWYER BUT AND SO WE DO WE GET TO ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL. GIVE OR TAKE COMPETITIVE GRANTS WHAT'S IF WE TOOK THE THIRTY THREE MILLION AND WE SIMPLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE [inaudible] GRANT. COMPETITIVE SLOTS AVAILABLE. MY MENTAL MATH IS NOT THAT GREAT. I GET IT SO. THAT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND THEN BY DOING SO WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO IMPACT MORE -- STUDENT PARENTS. THAT'S RIGHT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL IS JUST BECAUSE THE LIMIT ON COMPETITIVE AWARDS THAT WOULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO BUY ADDITIONAL AID TO THE STUDENT PARENTS WHO ARE. ELIGIBLE FOR BUT NOT OFTEN. LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SENATOR IF I MAY. ONE THING TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF IN IN LOOKING AT THE COMPETITIVE WARTS IS THAT AS THOSE AWARDS A RENEWED IN THE OUT YEARS. THE COSTS INCREASE BEYOND THOSE IN THE FIRST YEAR SO WHILE IT MAY BE ROUGHLY ONE MILLION PER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THAT COULD BE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND TWO MILLION THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. AND IF IT CAN BE VERY VOLATILE DEPENDING ON WHICH SEGMENT THE AWARD SHOWS UP IN A WHETHER IT. COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE INCREASED ROUTE REFRESH ME THE INCREASES BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE IS ADDED TO THE MIX. IT'S BECAUSE THERE ARE ARE. HEY LET'S SAY EVERY THOUSAND AWARD YOU WERE TO ADD YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF THOSE AWARDS THAT WERE NEW THE SECOND YEAR SO YOU GET A THOUSAND NEW AWARDS EACH YEAR. PLUS THE RENEWAL OF THAT HOUSE AND AWARDS BUT DON'T PEOPLE DROP OFF THE BACK END SOME DO SO YOU SEE THE INCREASE OVER FOUR YEAR PERIOD AND AFTER THOSE FOUR YEARS THEN YOU WILL SEE. MORE ABOUT A BASELINE BUT IT CERTAINLY INCREASES FROM YOUR ONE THREE YEAR OLD I SEE JUST ON A START UP IDE. RIGHT SO AFTER FOUR YEARS OF BECOME STABLE IN YOUR FUNDING LEVEL SHOULD BE THE SAME ABSENT. TUITION INCREASES THAT'S CORRECT ANYBODY ELSE. SIR IS READY MEAN TO CUT YOU OUT NOT NOT OF THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS SORT OF IMPORTANT OF THIS EQUATION I THINK. ARGUABLY -- JUST WANT TO SAVE MISTER NICK EMISSIONS PERSPECTIVE THAT WE DO APPRECIATE THIS PROPOSAL BY THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZES THE THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT -- THEIR FINANCIALLY SYSTEM WE HAVE WAS DESIGNED FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF STUDENT AT A DIFFERENT ERA. AND BY RECOGNIZING SPECIFICALLY THAT THIS ONE POPULATION STUDENT PARENTS FACES UNIQUE BURDENS AND COSTS WE THINK THAT THAT REPRESENTS -- AT THE VERY LEAST A GREAT STARTING POINT. FOR THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND RESHAPING AND EXPAND THE FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH STAKEHOLDERS SUCH AS OUR SEGMENT STUDENTS AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES. HAVE YOU HAVE YOU ALL DONE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TALK TO THIS BUT IF YOU OPEN AN ANALYSIS. ON THE ISSUE THAT I WAS JUST DISCUSSING THE INCREASING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS PERHAPS APPLICABLETO STUDENT PARENTS AS OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE AND WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE IN WHICH IS BETTER AND WHICH IMPACTS MORE PEOPLE. CERTAINLY I'M I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE A FINAL NUMBER YET AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO LET AND RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE THAT MR FERGUSON REYES WHICH IS THAT -- WHEN YOU WHEN WE INCREASE OR ADD NEW AWARDS THE COMPETITOR PROGRAM THOSE ARE FOR FIRST YEAR STUDENTS AND THEN? YOU ASSUME THAT THERE WILL E YOU KNOW STUDENTS RUNNING FOR A SECOND YEAR THIRTY YOUR FOURTH YEAR AT CETERA SO -- IN AND OF ITSELF IF THERE WERE LIKE IF EVERYBODY THIS ISN'T WOULDN'T HAPPEN BUT IF EVERYBODY WENT T COLLEGE FOR JUST ONE YEAR AND USE THE GRANT FOR JUST ONE YEAR. IT WOULD BE IN THE RANGE OF ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND NEW AWARDS BUT WHAT WE'RE STILL WORKING ON DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN APPLY PROJECT. TO THAT TO THAT DOES NOT OVERSTATE THE AVAILABILITY IT WOULD LIKELY BE SOMEWHERE AROUND THIS IS A VERY BALLPARK ESTIMATE THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO WHEN YOU FACTOR IN ALL OF THE RENEWALS AND YOU COULD I GUESS YOU COULD. SEGMENT UP STUDENT PARENTS. AS A CATEGORY IN THE COMPETITIVE GRANT APPLICATION PROCESS. THEORETICALLY YES WE USE A SCORING MATRIX FOR THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT WERE RE LOOK AT FACTORS LIKE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. FIRST GENERATION STATUS ETCETERA TO PRIORITIZE WHICH TUDENTS GET SOME OF THE LIMITED -- AVAILABLE WARD SO THEORETICALLY IF THAT WERE THE DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE COULD INCORPORATE ONLY INCORPORATE YOU KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE APPLICANT HAS DEPENDENT CHILDREN OF THEIR CARING FOR INTO THAT SCORING PROCESS RIGHT A MINUTE SO IF THAT'S THE POPULATION YOU WANT TO TRY TO HELP. IS IT BETTER TO DO IT THIS WAY OR THIS WAY THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF MY QUESTION. I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH. THE FACT THAT THAT POPULATION -- FROM IF YOU'RE NUMERICAL PERSPECTIVE IT APPEARS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. WOULD HELP A GREATER NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THAT POPULATION POOL BECAUSE IT IS IT. LIKE STATUTORILY TARGETS THE AWARD AT STUDENTS WITH DEPENDENT CHILDREN THAT'S A THAT'S A QUESTION EVERY APPLICANT FOR CALVIN ANSWERS ON THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID SO WE KNOW WHO THOSE ARE. CERTAINLY INCREASING THE GENERAL NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS WOULD HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE NUMBER WERE TO GO TO THAT STUDENT POPULATION. BUT IT WOULD BE FAR FROM A GUARANTEE. I'M AS OPPOSED TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD ENSURE THAT WITHOUT THOSE DOLLARS GO TO THAT POPULATION AND THEN A HOLLER HIGHER DOLLAR AMOUNT. CORRECT. YEAH THE THE AVERAGE -- THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARD -- FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT WHICH IS THE THE MAJORITY OF COMPETITIVE CALGARY SABAEANS IS A LITTLE UNDER SEVENTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS BECAUSE IT'S THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD. ADMINISTRATION ALSO WOULD BE -- SIX UP TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CABIN A. B. RECIPIENTS IN UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS RETIREMENT SEE RECIPIENTS SO YOU'D BE HAPPY BE HELPING. A SMALLER POOL [inaudible] BUT MORE. THAT'S A YEAH THAT'S A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION BY THE WAY MY SIMPLE BRAIN LOOKED AT I GOT IT. ANYTHING FURTHER TO LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ON THAT. OKAY. WELL LET'S MOVE TO THE NEXT% ISSUE THEN WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER SIX COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES FUNDING FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN NEW CAL GRANT COMPETITIVE AWARDS ANNUALLY AT A COST OF NINE POINT SIX MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR ENTITLEMENT AWARD BUT MEET OTHER CRITERIA AS OUTLINED BY THE COMMISSION. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HELLO. AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE IS A COMPANY THE AVAILABLE COMPATIBLE WHITES THAT RESULTS IN ONLY A SMALL SHARE OF ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. 11% RECEIVING AN AWARD OFFER. YOUR CHEN ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE INCLUDE SOME DATA ON THE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WERE NOT OFFERED WARD. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SEE TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE THAT THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND OF THESE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS NOT OFFERED AN AWARD. AND THAT THEY HAD NOT VIRGIN COMES ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND ANNUALLY. THIS IS JUST US THAT THERE IS. A LARGE AMOUNT OF UNMET DEMAND FOR THIS PROGRAM AMONG STUDENTS DEMONSTRATING A HIGH LEVEL OF FINANCIAL NEED. ACCORDINGLY WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE SPORTS IS JUSTIFIED. AND LEGISLATURE WISHES TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR CAO GRANTS WE DO RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING SUPPRESSED. THANK YOU CAN DETECT QUEST. MR BROTHER WILL FORGET YOU THIS. THANK YOU WELL WE ARE AGAIN JUST WANT TO SAY WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENT POPULATION -- AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE LAST ITEM THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAM DOES PRIMARILY SERVE -- ADULT LEARNERS -- THE PUT INPUT NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT POPULATION WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY STUDENTS ATTENDING -- OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- I TEND TO BE AMONG THOSE LEAST ADEQUATELY SERVED BY OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL AID. OUR SYSTEM AS SENATOR LEYVA IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH SO THE COMMISSION HAS LONG ADVOCATED -- FOR INCREASES IN THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS AND AND AGAIN WE LOOK FOR TO HELP THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS. A COMPREHENSIVE REFORM OF OUR FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM THAT WILL ENSURE THAT. ALL FINANCIALLY NEEDY AND QUALIFIED STUDENTS GET THE EIGHT ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO COMPLETE. THANK YOU SIR SEVERAL OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. SO ONE OF MY QUESTIONS IS. HOW TO THE COLLEGE PROMISE BOARD OF GOVERNORS TUITION WAIVERS FOR COMMUNICORP STUDENTS AFFECT THEIR ACCESS TO CAL GRANT OR THEIR CAL GRANT AWARDS? CERTAINLY SO -- WITH THE ARM THE CULTURE PROMISE WAIVER FORMALLY KNOWN AS THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS FEE WAIVER WHICH IS OPERATED BY THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BOARD OF GOVERNORS -- AND I'M YOU KNOW. WE DON'T OPERATE THAT PROGRAMS AND I'M SPEAKING FROM MY FAMILIARITY WITH IT -- AND EITHER MY CAN JUMP IN IF I MISSTATE ANYTHING OR DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION BUT THE COLLEGE PROMISED FEE WAIVERS SEARCH PRIMARILY TO WAIVE THE UNIT FEES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHICH CAN BE I AM I BELIEVE CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR A FULL TIME STUDENT -- V. CAL GRANT PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. SINCE IT'S NOT. TUITION THAT IS CHARGING COMMUNITY COLLEGES CALVET DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE UNIT FEES RATHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE A CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD FOR NON TUITION COSTS OKAY UP TO SIXTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO DOLLARS PER YEAR. OR CAL GRANT SEE WARFARE AND CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM OF A LITTLE UNDER ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO HAVE FUNDED SOME ADELINE PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS FUNDED BY PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT OF THE FULL TIME COMPLETION GRANT PROVIDES I BELIEVE UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT CAL GRANT THE ACCESS AWARD. FOR STUDENTS ALREADY GETTING THAT GRAHAM BE ACCESS WARD TO POTENTIALLY THEY COULD RECEIVE BOTH. CORRECT OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ARE CAL GRANT UNTIL GRANT AWARDS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS ATTENDING HALF OR LESS THAN HALF TIME -- I BELIEVE THE THE CAL GRANT IS AVAILABLE STUDENTS ATTENDING HALFTIME OR MORE SO THAT IS SIX SEMESTER UNITS OR MORE -- PER TURN THE PROGRAM I BELIEVE MAY BE THE SAME IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY. AND HAS FROM THE IDEA THERE'S A TON OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO CAN ANSWER THIS BUT OKAY ALL IN FAVOR RIGHT. VERY GOOD OKAY THANK YOU ONE MORE. HOW MANY OF THE UNDERSERVED STUDENTS? OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND WITHIN THE COMMITTED CAL GRANT PROGRAM OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPLICANTS. WHY DO NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION ON ME I'M SORRY I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GET THAT ALREADY IN THAT FORM IT WOULD BE VERY VERY YEAH WE CAN GET THAT FOR YOU AND I AM SURE WE ALREADY HAVE IT I JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE IT ON ME? IT'S POSSIBLE AND BEING TESTED THAT RIGHT NOW MY LONG STANDING FEAR OF CHECKING MY PHONE WHEN TESTIFYING -- I WILL BE LOOKING AT BUT I KNOW THAT APPROXIMATELY COMPETITIVE PROGRAM OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU LET'S MOVE -- TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WILL HOLD SIX SIX OPEN OBVIOUSLY. ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN RED DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES SIX POINT TWO MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF PROJECTS COSTS FOR THE COMMISSION'S GRANT DELIVERY SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJET.

THE STUDENT COMMISSION IS INDICATED THAT THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT UNIT WHICH PROVIDES TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND COLLEGE FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATORS. HAS EXPERIENCE EXTENSION INCREASES IN WORKLOAD OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. BASED ARE A FEW WE THINK THAT ADDING ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION TO DISCONNECT WOULD. REDUCE THE OVERTIME THAT THEIR EXISTING STAFF ARE WORKING AND ALLOW IT TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS EXPLAINED THAT IMPOSING TWO POSITIONS RATHER THAN ONE THE INTENT ALLOW THIS UNIT TO FIGHT HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE. TO HEAR WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF THAT IS A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY IN THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO PROVE BOTH POSITIONS. IT MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE REQUIRING THE STATE NEED PERMISSION TO REPORT ON THE UNITS HAVE COMMITTEES. JUST TO ENSURE THAT THE AUGMENTATION IS HAVING CONTENT THE FACT. THANK YOU [inaudible] TO RUN. JUST WANNA SAY ONCE AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORT -- MULTIPLE ANALYSES THAT WE HAVE DONE IT INDICATED A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STAFFING IN OUR AGENCY. ONE WAY TO LOOK AT IT IS WE DON'T JUST ADMINISTER STATE FINANCIALLY WE ARE VERY MUCH A CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENCY. OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE NOT JUST THE MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID FROM A STATE WIDE. BY OVER THREE HUNDRED COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS THOUSANDS OF HIGH SCHOOL SO -- IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO ENABLE TO PERFORM THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE MISSION -- WE'VE REQUESTED AND THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTED THIS STOPPING AUGMENTATION. BIRD REVISITING THIS LOTUS OPENS OUR LIVE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OUTSTANDING PRESENTATION WE WILL NOW MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. PROBABLY NEVER SEEN SEE A BUDGETS OF ONE COMMITTEE HEARING THIS SURE. YEAH WHATEVER [inaudible] WORK. BUT MAYBE I SPOKE TOO SOON. STEP ON DOWN I DON'T. KNOW. HERE THE GROUND RULES.

THIS RESPONSE OF THE CHILL OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS AND ALSO REPRESENTING OUR YOUTH ORGANIZATION THE CALIFORNIA DREAM NETWORK. LOOK OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH LAW THAT ORGANIZATION WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE EFFORTS BY THE LEGISLATURE.

HOPING -- SERVE MORE OF THE UNFUNDED WORK IN THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT POOL AS WELL AS HELPING ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT GROWING NON TUITION COSTS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING PARTICULARLY AT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES MA'AM. GOOD AFTERNOON LARA'S ABA CUBITS WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND SUCCESS WE ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT NEEDY STUDENT PARENTS BUT WE BELIEVE A MORE AFFECTED TARGET EFFECTIVE TARGETED SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING UNMET NEED WOULD BE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ANNUALLY AVAILABLE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AS HAS BEEN. SUGGESTED TODAY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT ELIGIBLE STUDENT PARENTS 71% OF APPLICANTS DO NOT RECEIVE ONE SIMPLY BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH FOR AVAILABLE. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION PROPOSED INSTEAD FIND OVER FIFTY THOUSAND MORE NEW COMPETITIVE AWARDS ALMOST TRIPLING THE CURRENT AMOUNT. THIS WOULD PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED STATE FINANCIAL AID TO MANY OF THE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. EACH YEAR MANY OF WHOM ARE PARENTS AND MOST OF WHOM ARE VERY LOW INCOME WHO DO NOT RECEIVE A CAL GRANT BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH FOR AVAILABLE. I'LL ALSO ADD THAT WE SUPPORT INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE CAL GRANT BE ACCESS AWARD THAT HELPS THE LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS COVER TOTAL COLLEGE COSTS INCLUDING CRITICAL LIVING EXPENSES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK TO HELP NEW NEEDY CALIFORNIANS AT THE FINANCIALLY THEY NEED TO ACCESS AND SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. THANK YOU YES MA'AM. GOOD MORNING BE I'VE READ SO THE CALIFORNIA I'D COALITION OUR COALITION IS THE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID REFORM WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE AND SUPPORTING -- TO SUPPORT SELF SUPPORTING A FAMILY SUPPORTING STUDENTS.

HELPED PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE THE EFFECT THAT FUNDING IS HAD ON OUR EDUCATION AND THE OVERALL STUDENT -- ONE THING THAT I WANTED TO TOUCH UPON IS THE AFTERMATH OF OVER ENROLLMENT THEM I FOUND. A FELLOW STUDENT HAD JUST MENTIONED. IN A SOCIETY THAT INCREASINGLY EMPHASIZE EDUCATION ISN'T AND IT'S INEVITABLE THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT CONTINUES TO GROW EXPONENTIALLY. WHAT IS NOT INEVITABLE IS THE LACK OF HOUSINGTHE STUDENTS ARE OFFERED -- I WAS IN ARE A LAST YEAR AND MANY STUDENTS WERE OFFERED A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MOVE OFF CAMPUS MADE YEAR. ON BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION HAD DISPLACED MAY TRANSFER STUDENTS WHO NOW DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE -- THOSE IN A COMPROMISE FINANCIAL POSITION MAY HAVE FELT COMPELLED TO TAKE THIS OFFER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT SCRAMBLING FOR HOUSING WHILE TRYING TO EARN A DEGREE. AND ARE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE -- SO YOUR SUPPORT OF THE UC BUDGET WOULD HELP PREVENT THE STUDENTS AND ENSURE THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE ONE LESS THING TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT PURSUING THEIR DEGREE.

OUT FINANCIAL AID AND STUDENT EXPERIENCE ON OUR CAMPUS AT UCLA -- WHAT MANY STUDENTS BEHIND ONCE THEY? BEGIN ATTENDING UCLA ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH FINANCIAL AID AND ESPECIALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES -- AS ONE OF THE SISTERS FROM SANTA BARBARA POINTED OUT. AND WHAT I LEARNED FROM. COURSE WITH DOCTOR TYRONE POWER. ON OUR CAMPUS WAS THAT FOR MOST OF THE BLACK POPULATION ON OUR CAMPUS WHICH IS OUR READY ONLY A AND HAS THE LOWEST RETENTION RATE OF ANY STUDENT GROUPS. ON CAMPUS. THEIR NUMBER ONE REASON FOR HAVING THAT RETENTION NUMBER IS ABOUT FINANCIAL. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT. COME UP REGARDING FINANCIALLY. PRIMARILY TAKE PLACE AGAIN WITHOUT WITH THE LACK OF SUMMER AID BUT ALSO. WITH. PETITIONS -- AND AND BROKE RAMPS THAT. ARE [inaudible] NOT. SUITED TO STUDENTS ACTUAL -- LIFESTYLE SO. IN MY EXPERIENCE. WHEN I TRANSFERRED TO UCLA? I HAD PREVIOUSLY. LIVE WITH MY FATHER MY SOLE SURVIVING. AND BUT HAD SINCE THEN. BOB. NO LONGER LIVE WITH HIM WAS PAYING MY OWN BILLS PAYING MY WAY THROUGH COLLEGE WORKING APPROXIMATELY FORTY TO SIXTY pTO SCHOOL. THE UNIVERSITY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO CHANGE MY STATUS TO INDEPENDENT.

WAS THAT BECAUSE I SIMPLY HAD CONTACT WITH MY FATHER -- THIS WAS A PHONE CALL. OR WHAT HAVE YOU DEBT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY STATUS TO INDEPENDENT SO THEN THE SCHOOL STILL LOOKED AT ME TOO HEY. THE APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET. FROM WORKING FULL TIME -- WHILE TRYING TO GO TO SCHOOL WHICH PREVENTING ME FROM BEING ABLE TO HAVE HOUSING.

HELLO EVERYONE MY NAME'S MICHELLE HOW ARE AND I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF SYSTEM AFFAIRS FOR THE STUDENTS AND OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY. I AM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT AT DE ANZA COLLEGE. AND WHAT AND MY FRIEND AMY WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THAT THERE IS. HI LEAH AND AN EQUITABLE KIND OF FIND FINANCIAL AID FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WE GET SENSE TO WHAT. DOLLARS THE UC STUDENTS GET. AND PEOPLE THINK THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS THE CHEAPER OPTION BUT THAT JUST ISN'T IT -- WE DO. NOT. NORMALLY STUDENTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS DON'T REALLY GET AID I JUST RECENTLY A GUY. GOT ACCEPTED INTO UC DAVIS AND THE FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE THEY GAVE ME COVERED ALL OF MY TUITION. BUT WHILE I WAS THE AND I WASN'T ABLE TO GET ANY FINANCIAL AID -- AND THAT WAS JUST REALLY WEIRD TO ME THAT WAS VERY ALARMING -- BECAUSE WHAT MOST PEOPLE ASSUME IS THAT STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIVE AT HOME WITH THEIR PARENTS JUST LIKE THEY DID IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THINGS LIKE HOUSING AND EVERYTHING. BUT THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION STUDENTS THAT ARE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VERY DIVERSE THEY'RE THE MOST DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITY HERE. AND I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO SUPPORT THEM THAT'S WHY AND THE STUDENTS AND OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SUPPORTS SB TWO NINETY ONE WRITTEN BY -- SENATOR LEYVA AND WE JUST WANT TO AGAIN THANK YOU. FOR EVERYTHING THANK YOU FOR JOINING US YES SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR RAWSON.
