EVEN DOWN TO THE EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE STAGING AREA EVEN CIRCULATION PATHWAYS MEANT TO SHOW HOW PEOPLE MOVE THROUGHOUT THE FESTIVAL GROUNDS. WILL CHAU EXACTLY WHO WILL COME IN EVERY EVENT WE HAVE WILL HAVE LICENSED PHYSICIANS LICENSE OUR ENDS EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. THE AMOUNT OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE SIZE OF THE EVENT. AS FOR THE SECURITY WE WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH WHAT IS DEFINED BY LOCAL REGULATION LAW ENFORCEMENT ON WATER RATIO IS PER PERSON. AND THAT IS WITH THE DEPLOYMENT HAS FOR SECURITY.

OKAY WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION BY DOCTOR CHOI SECOND BY VALLADARES- I HAVE A QUESTION MISTER BLOOM IF IT THAT'S OKAY- I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND IT'S IMPORTANT UPDATE THE CROWD SECURITY.

IN MY DISTRICT ARE NEAR MY DISTRICT THE SHOOTING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DURING A MUSIC CONCERT AT THE DEL MAR FAIR. THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS HURT CAN YOU ADDRESS THIS QUESTION- YES SIR- A COUNTY FAIRS ARE ALREADY REGULATED TO A BY SEPARATE TO. OF LAWS IN THE STATE. AND SO IT WAS FELT THAT WE MIGHT BE IN CONFLICT WITH- WITH THOSE REGULATIONS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND WITH THAT I THINK- DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH THANK YOU FOR- PRESENTING THIS BILLI THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY TIME THE AND- AS WE SEE. SOME UNFORTUNATE INSTANCES TO DO OUR APPAN SO WITH THIS ADOPTION OF A MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARD- I KNOW IF. AN EVENT IS SET IN PLACE- IN A JURISPRUDENTIAL OF A CITY OR COUNTY THAT THE LOCAL- AUTHORITY SAFETY MEASURES. ALONG WITH THE- A SPONSOR OF THE EVENT HOW- WITH THIS ZERO IMPROVE WHAT OF WHAT THE EXISTING ONE MINUTE MAYBE LIVE NATION- WHAT. ARE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF CAN. COMPARE THE EXISTING ONES AND HOW THAT WOULD BE HOW WITH THIS BILL WOULD BE FURTHER IMPROVED WHAT WAS LACKING- FOR THE INSTANCE OF THAT UNFORTUNATE INSTANCES THAT THAT TOOK PLACE. SO WILL THIS BE ANOTHER- WE SOLVE THAT PROBLEMS THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI WE CAN NEVER. BE CERTAIN IN ANY BILL WILL RESOLVE- EVERY POTENTIAL ISSUE- BUT- WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT ESSENTIALLY- MANDATES THAT ANYONE WHO IS PROMOTING ARE PUTTING ON A AN OUTDOOR CONCERT AT THE A TYPE THAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED WILL ADHERE TO THE BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLAY WHEN LIVE NATION ARE A E. G- UP A PUTS ON AN OUTDOOR. SO DOES THE X. OF BEST PRACTICES SO THAT EVERYONE IS REQUIRED TO FOLLOW CERTAIN A SET A BASELINE PRACTICES.

RECENT A COURT ORDER AGAINST AZERBAIJAN TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF ARMENIANS CULTURAL HERITAGE AFTER ARMENIA BUT A CASE TO THE A. C. A. C. J. WAS EVIDENCED IN RECENT YEARS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE ICJ RULED ON CULTURAL HERITAGE THE PRECEDENT HAS BEEN SET AND WE CAN FULLY EXPECT MORE COUNTRIES TO BRING SIMILAR CASES FORWARD. IN FACT SOME YEARS AGO ISIS- COMMITTED THE SAME CRIME BUT UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT'S NOT A NATION STATE- NO SUCH ACTION WAS TAKEN AGAINST THEM. CALIFORNIA HAS A PLACE ON THE GLOBAL STAGE TEMPOS COST ON ACTORS THAT ACT CONTRARY TO OUR VALUES BY LIMITING THE ACCESS TO OUR- SOUGHT AFTER CULTURAL SPACES- TO NOT IMPACT INDEPENDENT ARTISTS WHO ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.
