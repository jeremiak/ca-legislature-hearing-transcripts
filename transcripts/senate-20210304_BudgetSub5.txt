I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A. L. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY COLLEAGUES. ANYBODY QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS OKAY OF THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD OPEN- THIS ITEM. THE ISSUE. SIX IF YOU SIX IS OVERSIGHT FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS- BOB CARROLL- YES PLEASE. SHARE ESKEW MENTAL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT'S OKAY I'D LIKE TO KICK THIS OFF ON THIS ISSUE- JUST GOING TO GIVE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW THE FEMA PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROCESS IN A PLACE WITH THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS- THEY CAN. HELP US. OUT INCONSTANT CONTACT FOR THE IF YOU WERE REIMBURSED IT'S DEFINITE- YES WILL COVER- THE EXTENT OF THE OVER THIS INTERPLAY BETWEEN THOSE TWO PROCESS IS ACTUALLY VERY. ASTERS IS INCREASED IN THE IN RECENT YEARS OF. I'M JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN THE STATE HAS A MAJOR DISASTER WHERE THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. WE MEET MOST OF OUR FINE TUNING NEEDS THREE THROUGH FOR DIRECT RESPONSE ACTIVITIES USING THAT IS OUR- WHICH IS WHICH IS HAVE A COMPANY GENERAL FUND- THE FEMA PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDING IS GENERALLY RECEIVED AS REIMBURSEMENTS- SO ONCE HOSE RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS TYPICALLY DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL. ARE USED TO TREAT ALL FUNDING. AND THOSE DEPOSIT SHOPPERS REVENUE TO THE GENERAL FUND WITHIN HELLO YES BUDGET. I GIVE THAT OVER YOU JUST TO KIND OF HELP- SET THE STAGE FOR- IN THE NEXT WILL POINTS WHICH IS. SO THE- D. HE COULD NOT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDING IS FREE WITH. ONLY NOT. EVEN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR. THAT THE ACTUAL DISASTER RESPONSE COSTS OURS- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY IF YOU COULD EXCUSE ME JUST A SECOND. IT'S REALLY CUTTING IN AND OUT HERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO- YOU KNOW TWO. HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE IT'S GETTING CUT OUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO OR RECOMMEND THAT WE CAN DO. WOULD IT BE HELPFUL IF I TURNED OFF MY VIDEO. THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN OKAY THAT WITHOUT HELP. ALL YOU NEED A VERY. NOW RIGHT OKAY TRY TO LET'S TRY WE YOU TO W. AND OUT OR WILL WE MIGHT ASK YOU AFTER THIS SO WE'LL KEEP GOING. SO CLOSER TO MY MAKERS IS NOT A WHOLE. I'M SO THE FREE EVERY. THE THING OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE FUNDING IS NOT RECEIVED IN THE SAME FISCAL YEAR THAT THE SPENDING IS DONE. AND SO THEY DIDN'T THAT IMPACTS THE STATE BUDGET IN IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE TO DO KIND OF THEM ALMOST A YEAR BALANCING OF. THE EXPENDITURES ON DISASTER RESPONSE WITH WHEN WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE THAT REIMBURSEMENT REVENUE IN. NOW THEN OBVIOUSLY THE HIGHER THE AMOUNT OF ESTIMATED FUTURE REIMBURSEMENTS FROM DISASTERS THAT TAKE PLACE THE LARGER THE IMPACT IS ON AN INDIAN INTERPLAY WITH THE STATE BUDGET. SO THAT KIND OF SITTING CONTACTS FOR- EXPLAINING HOW SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS. MAKE MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE. TO ESTIMATE AND- PROJECT. THE IMPACTS AND WHEN THEY'RE GONNA BE FELT SO SOME OF THE FEMUR PROCESS IT IT'S VERY COMPLEX AND THERE ARE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT HAVE TO BE ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHICH SPECIFIC COSTS ARE GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. AND IT TAKES SOME TIME TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM FEMA REIMBURSEMENT AND- THAT KIND OF GOES ALONG. ALONG WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT FEMA WOULD REIMBURSE A 100% FOR% CERTAIN PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES OF DETERMINING ELIGIBLE COSTS IT'S IT IS THERE'S A PROCESS TO CHALLENGE PROCESS AT THAT. DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE CHANGE FROM SAY 75% A 100% AS WITH THE OTHER CHALLENGES AND JUST DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY OVERALL- OTHER KIND OF CONSIDERATION THIS IS MORE COVERT SPECIFIC AND THEN IT IS IN GENERAL DISASTER BUT ONE OF THE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IS THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR DISASTER FEMA REIMBURSEMENT ISN'T THE ONLY SOURCE FOR FINDING IN PLAY AND SO PART OF THE COMPLEXITY IN THIS PARTICULAR PROCESS IS BOUNCING THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE THE CURRENT VIRUS REALLY FIND- AND A FEW OTHER SOURCES OF FEDERAL FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE TO HELP WITH PUBLIC COSTS. BUT THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING VERY HARD TO MAXIMIZE OUR USE OF FEDERAL FUNDING OVERALL FOUND PART OF THAT IS JUST FIGURING OUT WHERE THE PIECES OF THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL FUNDING PASSED THAT- AND THAT AND THAT ALSO HELPS IS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF HAVING FEMA CLAIMS BE REDUCED OR DENIED BECAUSE OF ANY SORT OF LEVEL OF AN ELIGIBLE COSTS BE INCLUDED WITHIN. A PARTICULAR CLAIM APPLICATION. AND SO THERE'S A COUPLE DIFFERENT AND VERY ACCESS SEVERAL NUMBER. THAT CAN AFFECT. THE AMOUNT A FEW MARIA. I WILL GET ON JUST A COUPLE HIGH LEVEL- PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE OF COURSE YOU TALK ABOUT ELIGIBILITY LITTLE BIT- FEMA COSTS HAVE TO BE. MEET THE FEMA GUIDELINES WHICH ARE FAIRLY BROAD AND THERE'S FAIR ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION. AND I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN COVERT NINETEEN. THIS IS A NEW TYPE OF DISASTER FOR FEMALE JUST LIKE IT IS FOR THE STATE OF EVERY STATE AND LOCALS AND EVERYBODY ELSE. SO SOME OF THAT COMPLEXITY IS A LITTLE BIT DEEPENED BY THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO FIGURE. OUT HOW TO APPLY CERTAIN GUIDELINES. THANKS. TO THIS KIND OF NEW SITUATION AS WELL. I HAVE BEEN IN. IS THAT IT'S ALSO THE CORPORATION WHICH IS NOT. CONTINUE CONCEPT IT WE DO AT THE STATE LEVEL TO WHERE VARIOUS THINGS ARE ARE MADE AVAILABLE SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION. BUT THAT MEANS THAT- WITHOUT ADEQUATE YOU KNOW FUNDING BEING PROVIDED BY. CONGRESS THEN OBVIOUSLY THE AVAILABILITY OF- FUNDING FOR FEMA TO REIMBURSE US- I CAN IN IMPACT THE TIMING I DON'T KNOW THE MEANING- YES CAN TALK MORE TO THIS WHEN THEY DO CAN BE GENERAL OVERVIEW AFTER QUESTIONS WITHIN GENERALLY IT'S A MATTER OF TIMING AND THAT CAN RELATE IN SOME OF THE DELAYS WHICH ALSO IMPACTS THE- THE STATE BUDGET. AND THEN ALSO JUST KIND OF A LAST POINT TO MAKE IS THAT FEMA FUNDING ISN'T JUST AVAILABLE SPECIFIC TO COPE WITH NINETEEN SO. THE FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FEMA TO SUPPORT REIMBURSEMENTS- IS AVAILABLE SUPPORT ALL TYPES OF DISASTERS THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOU KNOW WILDFIRES AND HURRICANES AND TORNADOES EARTHQUAKES FLOODS. YOU NAME IT- AND THEN IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ACROSS IN ALL FIFTY STATES SOME SOME OTHER US TERRITORIES AND SO YOU KNOW KIND OF. COMPETING FOR RESOURCE PERSPECTIVE IT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WORKING. WITH OTHER STATES IN AND LOCAL ENTITIES WITHIN OUR STATE- THOSE ROCK AND WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME PART OF FEMA FUNDING SO THEIR NUMBER A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE TIMING. RECEIVING A VETERAN RESPONSE. AND COMPLEXITIES INVOLVED IN ESTIMATING AMERICA REIMBURSEMENTS. AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN IN A PLACE WITH THE STATE BUDGET SO WANTED TO USE THAT AS A SETTING STAGE- AND I'LL TURN OVER TIME NOW TO- YES TO TALK A BIT. MORE ABOUT THE ACTUAL TO THE PROCESS ITSELF. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CARACTERIZA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST RESHAPE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS AND THE THING ABOUT CONSTANCE OPENING ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC OF THE FEMA REIMBURSEMENT I THINK THE MESSAGE AT STEVENS AT WHAT'S THAT WELL AS THE RULING PROBABLY HAS PLACES THE GATEWAY OR STEWARD OF THESE FUNDS IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT SOMETHING IT'S THAT SEND YOU GUYS I CERTAINLY FOR WILD EARTHQUAKES FLOODS.

SOURCE FOR- AND HELP TO RECOVER ELIGIBLE COSTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GROUPS- THIS PATHWAY THE STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ADDS SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND TO SOME DEGREE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALL POTENTIAL APPLICANTS TO THIS PROGRAM WE WORK WITH ALL OF THEM EQUALLY IN ORDER TO NAVIGATE ADDS- AND- MAXIMIZE THAT REIMBURSEMENT ORACLE BID AND ALL THE OTHER MULTITUDE ASK FEDERAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS THAT ARE IN PLAY AT ANY GIVEN TIME IN CALIFORNIA.

IS NO THAT WAS ALLEN FROM THE YEAR LAST YEAR GONNA BE BACK A HUNDRED. FOR ALL ACT. BUT WE WAITING ON FEMA FIRST GUIDANCE. FROM THAT GENERATE TWENTY WHEN I ABOUT. ESPECIALLY DURING THIS DURING THIS TIME I'M SURE YOU'RE- A- WORKING A LOT. HARDER THERE WOULD YOU DO ESPECIALLY A PRE EMERGENCIES SO WE'RE PRETTY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WE MOVE ON TO ISSUES SEVEN OF- OVERVIEW OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC SPENDING. WILLIAMS STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE- SO SINCE THE ONSET OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT ACTIONS TO SAVE LIVES BY HELPING TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE NINETEENTH AND THAT'S BEEN DONE UNDER THE VERY THREE THE REGISTRY SERVICES ACT AND OTHER LAWS THAT GOVERN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. IN THIS EFFORT AND BEEN LED- JOINTLY BY CALLAWAY GAS IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BERMAN AND USING THAT STRATEGY- THE STATE'S ACTED VERY SWIFTLY TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE MUTUAL AID RESOURCES TO HELP TO RESPOND ACROSS THE STATE- AND THAT COULD NINETEEN PANDEMIC RESPONSES INCLUDED A LOT OF DIFFERENT CORE RESPONSE EFFORTS REACTIVE THESE- I KNOW THAT THE AGENDA TODAY INCLUDED A CHART THAT WE- ARE PROVIDED IN IN THE BUDGET AND THE B. C. P. THAT WAS- POST. THAT SHOWED- THE KIND OF MAJOR COST CATEGORIES AN ESTIMATED COST FOR THAT SO I WON'T GO INTO ALL THE DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE VARIOUS STRINGS OF ACTIVITY HAVE BEEN AND THAT CERTAINLY AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT AND EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S RANGED FROM CANOPY IN A MEDICAL SURGEON. MAXINE'S AND OTHER VARIOUS- MS NOW BUT POPULAR. IN AND A LOT OF FOOD WASTE. SO IN THE JANUARY TWENTY ONE GOT DIED. WE REFLECT THAT AS- DIRECTORS BY COSTS OF THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS- IN ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND IMPACT FROM THAT. TO DATE SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY FINANCES ALSO PROVIDED UPDATES WRITTEN NOTIFICATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE- REGARDING SORT OF A CASH FLOW BEHIND THAT IF YOU WILL SO. SO FAR WE PROVIDE INFORMATION ON APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN VARIOUS TRANSFERS AND APPROPRIATIONS- I'M IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEARS THE ROSTER AUTHORIZED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF- THE JURY OFF ON THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. I'M CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. AND THEN THERE WERE A FEW- RELATED APPROPRIATIONS NEW TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. SO OF THE THIRTEEN BILLION- ABOUT EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION AND I KIND OF A CASH FLOW BASIS HAS BEEN PROVIDED OUT TO- DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. SO SPECIFIC TO THE ACTUAL BCP THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF ONE TIME CHEN FOR OFFLINE. IT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT. IS ACROSS VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND IT REFLECTS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT DIRECT RESPONSE EXPENDITURE ACTIVITIES- OF THAT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. THE REQUESTED ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT BUDGETS AND SO THERE WE SET UP SOME CODE SPECIFIC ITEMS APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE CAN- AND THE FUNDING AUTHORIZED UNTRACKED INDEPENDENTLY OF OTHER THINGS TO CAN HELP WITH. WHEN TRACKING PROCESS IS THAT THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION SHOWS UP IN THOSE PUBLIC SPECIFIC PICK ITEMS WITH PROLIFERATION. I'M REMAINING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. IS ESTIMATED FOR STATEWIDE- ACTIVITIES THAT RANGE FROM THE HOSPITAL SURGEON- TESTING IN VACCINE DISTRIBUTION MINISTRATION BUT THEY'RE ALL ACTIVITIES WHERE THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF- UNCERTAINTY STILL IN REGARDS TO WHICH DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY WILL NEED TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURES AND SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS. KEPT THAT PART OUT SEPARATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS AND THROUGH ONE OF THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET CONTROL SECTIONS IN LATER- ITEMS OF THE AGENDA HERE SO I WON'T GET INTO THOSE SPECIFICALLY BUT THEY'RE ONE OF THOSE CONTROL SECTIONS- IS THE MECHANISM THAT WOULD BE USED. TO EXPAND OUR ALLOCATE AND EXPAND THE OTHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- A PAST WEEK COSTS. I'M SO I JUST WOULD KNOW THAT- MINISTRATION HAS BEEN PROVIDING A REGULAR FISCAL UPDATES- WE DO SO IN APRIL MAY AUGUST NOVEMBER. AND THEN IN THE GOVERNOR BUDGET GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY SO. PROXIMALLY EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS WE'VE BEEN DOING EVERY TWO MONTHS WE'VE BEEN DOING. ESTIMATED FISCAL UPDATES AND AS A PART OF THOSE FISCAL UPDATES. WE PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED SPLITS BETWEEN FUND SOURCES SUCH AS THE GENERAL FUND ANTICIPATED FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS- USES SIERRA FUNDS AND OTHER FEDERAL FUNDS OF PRIVATE FUNDS- AND YES I'M TERMS OF THE ACTUAL SPENDING THAT'S KIND OF. WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMES LOOKS AT THIRTEEN BILLION AND WE PROPOSE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IN- TWENTY TWENTY ONE THROUGH BCP. WE ALSO NOTED THAT THE CPM WHICH STILL RINGS TRUE- GIVEN THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF COVERT NINETEEN AND THE RESPONSE EFFORTS. THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE PROPOSAL WILL BE UPDATED AS PART OF A MAJOR REVISION AS WE CONTINUE TO REFINE. COST ESTIMATES AND AS DIFFERENT- STREAMS OF ACTIVITY EVOLVE- I THINK EVERYBODY'S AWARE THAT BECOME THE STREAMS OF ACTIVITIES INVOLVED RELATIVELY QUICKLY. OVER THE PAST YEAR AS WE RESPONDED OPEN. WITH THAT I WILL- SEE THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS- COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DOES THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY COMMENTS- YES TRUE SORT OF OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO EVALUATE THE MERITS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS MAKING OUT THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN PROPOSED SPENDING. INCLUDING WHETHER THE PROPOSAL IS JUSTIFIED AND CONSISTENT WITH ITS PRIORITIES AND REFLECTS THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE BELIEVES IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CARRY OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES- I'D ALSO NOTE THAT OUR TO OUR- THE L. A- PUT TOGETHER A- HAND OUT ON THE- SPENDING PROPOSED FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND- SPECIFICALLY THAT. PROPOSAL WHICH MAKES UP OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION OF TH ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND I'M HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RECEIVED A COPY OF THAT IF THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN HAVING OUR COMMENTS WERE PRESENTED IN THE- HELPS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES ON THAT. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU SO- COLLEAGUES IN THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS YES SENATE QUARTERS THE FIGURE BENCHER- JUST I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE OF THEM IS VERY. OF VERY SPECIFIC LINE ITEM TYPE OF QUESTION HOW MUCH. OF THESE COSTS- ACTUALS ARE INCREASES OF WOULD CUT BACK OVER TIME AND I AYE ASSET ONLY BECAUSE I WOULD. ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE THAT I'M- I'M NOT JUDGING WHETHER OR NOT OVER TIME- YOU SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE A OF AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF THESE DOLLARS BUT I JUST WANT I DON'T SEE A LINE ITEM. THAT BREAKS THAT OUT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY- FISCAL SORGEN STEVENS WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE FISCAL TABLE- DOESN'T GO INTO THE LEVEL OF GRANULAR DETAIL OF OVER TIMES THAT THERE IS THAT TOP CATEGORY OF STATE RESPONSE OPERATIONS. TO THE OVERTIME THAT'S BEING- WORKED BY VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS AND WILL BE A PART OF THAT LINE ITEM. AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF OVERTIME THAT'S THAT'S BEING WORKED OUT VERY STRONG DEPARTMENTS DEPARTMENT THAT MEAN FOR EXAMPLE- YES THIS YEAR AND- AND THEY'VE GOT STAFF THAT ARE WORKING YOU KNOW. FUSON LOTS OF OVERTIME AND CERTAINLY AND CDPH ANOTHER HHS AGENCIES AS WELL- IF IT AFFECTS IT IN. VARIOUS FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT BUT CERTAINLY THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF OVERTIME. HE SAID HAS IT BEEN. HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY- YOU KNOW ABSENCE AND DUE TO THE PANDEMIC OR DO WE KNOW. I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT QUANTIFY THAT RIGHT NOW AGAIN I THINK IT WOULD VERY SUBSTANTIALLY FROM DEPARTMENT TO DEPARTMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE LIKE CDC ARE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT OKAY BACK FILLING POSTS YOU KNOW WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OVER TIME FOR THEM- IT MAY BE LESS OF AN ISSUE FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS I THINK IT'S- YOU KNOW KIND OF BACKFILLING ASPECT. WOULD KIND OF COME INTO PLAY WITH MORE WITH DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE KIND OF SET HOST HI YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES FOR WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO BE ON CERTAIN DUTIES IN CERTAIN SPOTS AT CERTAIN TIMES. AT SOME POINT THAT INFORMATION MIGHT BE OF INTEREST NOT. CONCERNED BUT IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE ITEM TODAY AND- I GUESS AT ONE LEVEL IT IS WHAT IT IS BUT IT- IT WOULD BE. OF SOME INTEREST TO. TO UNDERSTAND THE BREAK DOWN HOW MUCH OF IT DRIVEN BY. INCREASED- INTENSITY OF CARE ACUTE CARE DRIVEN BY INMATES HOW MUCH. THE IN TERMS OF. ABSENCES IN THE LEGISLATURE SERVICE TAKING A BROADER ISSUES IN TERMS OF PAID SICK LEAVE AND SO FORTH AND- MY HELP. HELP US UNDERSTAND SO. I WOULD JUST EIGHTY OF. THAT BREAK BREAKDOWN IS- IN IN SOMEBODY'S HR- SPREADSHEET SOMEWHERE AND IT CAN BE EASILY DISSEMINATED TO THE COMMITTEE I'M SURE IT WOULD BE OF INTERESTTO EVERYONE- YOU KNOW IN THE NEAR TERM. BUT AGAIN NOT. I'M I'M NOT. HINGING MAYA. SUPPORTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ISSUE ON THAT. THAT THE BIGGER QUESTION I HAVE REALLY IS ONE THAT I THINK. I COULD PROBABLY BRING UP. ANYWHERE IN THE NEXT SEVERAL ITEMS WHICH HE DID MENTION THE CONTROL CONTROL SECTION. IN IT I THOUGHT IF OF ARE YOU READY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE REMAINING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. WOULD BE- ESSENTIALLY REPORTED OUT PURSUANT TO THE TO THE CONTROL SECTION ACT I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE AND TWO OTHERS- I THINK TWENTY CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT MIGHT HAVE SOME. SOME RELEVANCE OR THIRTY SIX BUT- LET ME JUST SAY CONTROL SECTION WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS. WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. YOU KNOW I CAN UNDERSTAND ATTEMPTED COMPLIANCE TO THE CONTROL SECTION AND I APPRECIATE THAT I TAKE YOU. OF YOUR FOR YOUR TO COMPLETE CREDIBLE IN THE HEAD BUT WHERE DOES IT GO WHAT IS THE PATH INTO THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. HIS HEARING THIS ITEM TODAY BECAUSE OSTENSIBLY WE HAVE JURISDICTION TO SOME DEGREE OVER. OVER THE SUBJECT MATTER- BUT I'M NOT CLEAR IF THE CONTROL SECTION. WOOD ESSENTIALLY CLOSED LOOP WITH THIS SUB COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT I'M I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT THIS THE COMPOSITION OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE IS DIFFERENT THAN. OTHER LEGISLATIVE SUB BODIES OR POLICY COMMITTEES YOU KNOW WHERE THAT INFORMATION MY VERY WILL SHOW UP- BUT IT MAY NOT BY INCLUDE A IS THE SAME THE SAME MEMBERS WHO HAVE- SERVE WEIGHED IN ON THE ON TODAY'S ITEM FOR EXAMPLE SO I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND HOW. IT'S REALLY THE PATHWAY FOR INFORMATION I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HERE. YOU KNOW IT. IT WITH A CONCERN ON MY PART ABOUT HOW DO I DO MY JOB IN TERMS OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT WHAT WHETHER I'M- WHETHER I'M IN AGREEMENT EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT THIS IS A GOOD EXPENDITURE. OR AN APPROPRIATE EXPENDITURES SWORD BESIDE THE POINT FOR THE QUESTION I'M ASKING. I THINK. IN GENERAL PROBABLY LEGISLATIVE COLLABORATION AROUND THESE ISSUES WHEN WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF PANDEMIC IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE NORM IS PROBABLY APPROPRIATE- GIVEN THAT- YOU KNOW THE MONEY HAS TO GO OUT THE DOOR SO TO SPEAK BUT GOOD WITHIN THE OTHER END OF THE CONTINUUM OF ON THAT OR THE PENDULUM IS- IF. IF WE HAVE A RULE THAT SAYS A CONTROL SECTION THIS IS. OTHERS A SORT OF A RIGHT TO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OR- THEY DID THAT IT SHOULD HAPPEN WITH THE PATHWAY DOESN'T. YOU KNOW NAVIGATE RIGHT BACK TO THE SAME LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE ISSUE UP TO THIS POINT IF YOU SEE WERE MY CONCERN IS THERE AND I'M I WONDER WHAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE. A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT I DO OF. HOW THAT INFORMATION GETS. BACK TO THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE- YOU KNOW OKAY I WOULD I WOULD ASSUME IT. ONE POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE RESPONSE TO THAT WOULD BE AT THE CALL OF THE CHAIR- YOU KNOW WE COULD RECONVENE NO AROUND INFORMATION THAT CAME INTO THE CONTROL SECTION BUT I'M I'M NOT SURE IF THAT AWARENESS IS GOING TO BE CREATED BY. THE INFORMATION PATHWAY ON THAT SO THANK YOU I'M SORRY FOR THE LONG QUESTION BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTOOD WHERE I WAS COMING FROM THERE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE THE CONTEXT- YES I THINK I CAN ADD SOME CLARITY THERE. SO THE WAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S OUT FRAME WORK FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WORKS. IS THAT THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION PROPOSED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IS ACTUALLY PROPOSED IN SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS LIKE WE WOULD ANY OTHER BUDGET ITEMS. SO ALL OF THOSE WILL BE HEARD. THROUGH THIS REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS THE HEARINGS AND ENACTING THE BUDGET JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER BUDGETS REFLECT THAT'S ONE POINT. FOUR OF THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. THAT'S HOW THAT WILL BE. AND HANDLES RELIGIOUSLY OVERSIGHT. AND THE LEGISLATIVE. PERSPECTIVE DURING ANY PIECE FOUR HUNDRED. THAT'S THE PART WHERE YOU DON'T CRY HAVE CLAY AROUND WHICH DEPARTMENT SPECIFICALLY NEED TO MAKE. HE SPENT A HUNDRED YEARS AND SO RATHER THAN PUT THE EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY INTO DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY NEED IT YET. THE PROPOSAL WAS TO KEEP THAT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SEPARATE AND IT'S ACTUALLY CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO THAT WOULD BE THE MECHANISM THAT WE WOULD USE FOR THAT. WHAT AND WHAT CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINETEEN DOES IS IT AUTHORIZES THE CONTINUED USE OF THE DRILL MECHANISM IN THE BUDGET. TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY AROUND THAT SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THREE L. I. IS THE FUNDING MECHANISM THAT THE STATE PRIMARILY USES WHENEVER IT'S RESPONDING. TO MAJOR DISASTERS. SO WITH WORKS IS THE AND YOU MISTER PART OF FINANCE FRANKLY- PROVIDES ALLOCATION NOTICES. JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHENEVER IT IS GOING TO ALLOCATE FUNDING. INTO THREE ARE. FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS TO RESPOND TO DISASTER. SO TH WAY THAT IT WORKS. IN A PRACTICAL SENSE WITH A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS. IS ONCE WE DETERMINED. WHICH DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO SPEND A PORTION OF THAT. THERE WOULD BE A NOTICE SENT TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT SAYS WE ESTIMATE WE DIEM THERE'S- X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE USED FOR. AND WHICH DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO. AND THAT WOULD BE OUR NOTE TO SAY THIS THIS IS HOW IT PLANNING ON USING IT IT WOULD BE USED FOR COSTS THAT ARE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF COST CATEGORIES THAT WE SAW IN FISCAL UPDATES WE DO THAT BLUE TABLE THAT YOU SEE IN THE AGENDA. THAT WOULD. BE USED TOWARDS THOSE TAXES COST ACTIVITIES. TYPICALLY WHAT WE'VE DONE ANY TIME WE HAVE A NEW ACTIVITY THAT'S OUTSIDE OF WHAT'S OUTLINED IN THAT UPDATE IS WE- ARRANGE TO DO. BRIEFINGS WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY HATE WHATEVER EXCEPT FOR EXAMPLE- GOOD RECENT EXAMPLE BUT YEAH FOR IN DECEMBER FOR EXAMPLE- THERE IS A NEED TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE- AND FIVE HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ARRANGED- MEETINGS AND BRIEFINGS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE WITH STAFF AND IN PROVIDE NOTIFICATION LETTERS TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT THE ESTIMATED COST WAS. BUT THE MECHANISM TO ACTUALLY MAKE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. TO THE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS A BUSINESS AND OVERSIGHT. OF THIS. IS A MESS UP WITH THEIR ACTUAL NAME IS SORRY I GET TO PLAY WITH THE ACRONYMS- BUT MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING THE FUNDING WAS THROUGH THE FIRST THREE HOURS AND SO THAT'S HOW WE WOULD. WE'VE PROPOSED CONTINUING THAT SAME MECHANISM THAT WE'VE BEEN USING. THROUGHOUT COATED- AND TO CONTINUE TO DO OUR FISCAL UPDATES THE LEGISLATURE AND THE BRIEFINGS WITH- STAFF MEMBERS TO EXPLAIN NEW NEW ISSUES AND NEW ACTIVITIES AS THEY ARISE. I THINK IT COULD BE- SECRETARIES THE THAT IN THE NEXT- THE NEXT ISSUE OF BUNDY BUDGET SPENDING AUTHORITY WILL GET AN OVERVIEW OF THAT AND MAYBE THAT WILL HELP AS WELL. YEAH I DIDN'T I DIDN'T WANT TO JUMP AHEAD IT WAS JUST LIKE YEAH YEP THE OPPORTUNE OF FULL UP ON HIS ON THE MISTER BENSON'S CONTROL SECTION COMMENT YEAH WHILE WE WERE STILL ON THIS ITEM YES BUT YEAH I WILL I WOULD LIKE TO GO. THROUGH TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT. MORE LATER WHEN WE GET TO THE ITEM AMID OF THE- IT TOO HOW MUCH OF IS. AND TO. GRIEF YOU KNOW THE LARGEST VERSUS AFTER THE FACT SO FOR FOLKS WHO WERE LISTENING IN AND- THERE IS YOUR FORESHADOWING OF WHAT- I THINK I WOULD BE ASKING ABOUT WE GET TO THAT ITEM THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU- THANK YOU SENATOR I AM. I AGREE WITH YOU THERE IS THE IS THERE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE HERE BUT I THINK- HOPEFULLY OVERALL ONCE WE GO THROUGH ALL THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS- THAT WOULD PROBABLY WILL JUMP BACK TO THIS WITH WITH SOME MORE QUESTIONS THANK YOU. SIR NEWMAN. OKAY ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVE ON THEN. TO AND I ALREADY ASKED BELIAU. FOR THAT. SORT OF BORED- LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE- YES WE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO- ANSWER SENATOR CORTESE'S QUESTION A BIT MORE IN THE NEXT- ITEM ON THE CONTROL SECTION WHERE WE CAN TALK A BIT ABOUT THE EXACT LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED AND AS WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN GREATER DETAIL AT THAT POINT OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THAT LATER IN THE YEAR GREATER DEATH. AND WE HAVE SEVERAL- ISSUES ARE CONNECTED AND RELATED TO THIS FROM THE- BUDGET SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SPECIFIC BUDGET CONTROLLED SECTION SO. I THINK THIS WILL ALL ADD UP I THINK HOPEFULLY. ONE GREATER CLARITY ON OUR PART- AND ALSO WHAT DO WE BELIEVE- THE AUTHORITY SHOULD BE AND- WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS ARE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT AUTHORITY. SO LET'S MOVE ON IF WE CAN TO- ISSUE EIGHT. OF BUDGET SPENDING AUTHORITY. WHO'S GOING. TO SORT OF BORED- LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS OFFICE. I BELIEVE BY YOUR AND RICK THAT WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE VARIOUS EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES AVAILABLE TO THE GOVERNOR AND SOME BRIEF DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THEY'VE YEARS BEEN USED RELATED TO COPE WITH NINETEEN- TO BEGIN WITH THERE'S TWO MAIN STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT GET THE GOVERNOR EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES ARE THE FIRST ALL TALK ABOUT IS THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER ASSISTANCE SACKS EVA. IT WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND LATER AMENDED TO CREATE THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT THIS IS THE JURY- ACCOUNT THAT MR BENSON HAS BEEN REFERENCING STATUTE GIVES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE AUTHORITY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FROM DARIO OFFER EMERGENCY RELATED COSTS UPON NOTIFICATION TO JAIL BC HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO REQUIREMENTS ON THE AMOUNT OR TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT MUST BE PROVIDED WITH THAT TYPE OF NOTIFICATION. I THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE ALLOCATED SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THIS MANNER FROM- AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY FOURTH FOR CODE NINETEEN RELATED RESPONSE- CDA AND NATIONALLY LIMITS THE USE OF DREAMLAND TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. TO WITHIN A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS OF THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY HOWEVER THAT- AUTHORIZATION TO USUARIO AND CAN BE EXTENDED AND NINE HUNDRED TWENTY DAY INCREMENTS. THROUGH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE FIRST EXTENSION WAS NAY. SO WITH RESPECT TO CORBETT NINETEEN THAT MEANS THAT TRIO UP. WILL BE UNAVAILABLE FOR KOBE NINETEEN RESPONSE- AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE THE FIRST EXPANSION TOOK PLACE ON JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY- THE INTENT BEHIND THIS TIME LIMIT. WAS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENDED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO SEEK FOR US FUNDING FOR ONGOING EMERGENCIES THROUGH THE STATE BUDGET ACT IF THEY'RE GOING TO EXTEND BEYOND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT TRIO- ISN'T IT CAN BE USED FOR. ON THE NECK MAJOR OF STAB THAT- EMERGING SPENDING AUTHORITY COMES FROM THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WHICH WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY. THE CALIFORNIA REGENCY SERVICES ACT PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION A WIDE RANGE OF EMERGENCY POWERS ARE WITH RESPECT TO EMERGENCY SPENDING POWERS IT ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND ANY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO RE DIRECT STATE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL PROPERTY APPOINTMENT AND APPROPRIATIONS TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCY UNDER CAESAR THERE IS NO APPROVAL OR NOTIFICATION REQUIRED- IT'S BEEN USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO RESPOND TO COPE WITH NINETEEN. FOR EXAMPLE FUNDS- THAT WERE FREED UP DUE TO THE DECREASE AND THEY MAY POPULATION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION'S. WE'RE REDIRECTED TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND PRISONS IN ADDITION ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES WERE REDIRECTED TO CONTRACT RACING- DUTIES. ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS- USE THE GOVERNOR'S POWERS UNDER THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THREE HOURS AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY ALLOCATED THAT FUNDING OUT THREE THREE HOUR. IN ADDITION TO THESE BROAD EMERGENCY POWERS THAT APPLY TO ALL EMERGENCIES THERE'S ALSO CASES WHERE THEY EMERGED WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED THE ADMINISTRATION WITH. EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES FOR SPECIFIC EMERGENCIES- THIS HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO COVERT NINETEEN WHEN CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX WAS ADDED TO THE TWENTY NINETEEN TO. TWENTY BUDGET ON MARCH SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY. THAT CONTROL SECTION MADE UP TO ONE BILLION AVAILABLE FOR COVERT NINETEEN RELATED PURPOSES IT REQUIRED A SEVENTY TWO HOUR ADVANCE NOTIFICATION POURED TO JAIL B. C. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE BEFORE THE FUNDS COULD BE SET SPENT. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALLOCATED EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION THROUGH CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX. BUT IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET THE CURRENT BUDGET PHAM AND SO IT IS CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE TO THE ADMINISTRATION. ON ANOTHER IMPORTANT SOURCE OF EMERGENCY SPENDING IS- AUTHORITY TO SPEND FEDERAL FUNDS- THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEND FEDERAL FUNDS WITHOUT PROVISION BEING MADE FOR IT THROUGH THE BUDGET ACT. FROM IN CERTAIN CASES THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE SPECIFIC PROVISION TO SPEND FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WRE PROVIDED FOR KOBE NINETEEN FOR EXAMPLE CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY WAS ADDED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION. AUTHORITY TO ALLOCATE NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IN BONDS FROM THE FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS RELIEF ARM FUND. THE CONTROL SECTION LAID OUT ALLOWABLE USES OF THOSE DOLLARS ON HOWEVER IT DID ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO REDIRECT THOSE FUNDS TO OTHER PURPOSES BUT REQUIRED A TEN DAY NOTIFICATION. TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET- COMMITTEE FOR SUCH RE ALLOCATIONS. AT THIS POINT ALL OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED BY ELEVEN- CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINETY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ADDED CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE TWO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE READY TO ALLOCATE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR TESTING AND CONTRACT TRACING. IT WAS LATER AMENDED TO ALLOW FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION AND FOOD ASSISTANCE TO REFLECT NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION MAKING FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THOSE PURPOSES. TROLL ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE REQUIRES A TEN DAY ON NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- HOWEVER IN. OFTEN IT'S THE CASE THAT FEDERAL FUNDS WILL BECOME AVAILABLE FOR AN EMERGENCY FAN. AND IT WILL BE CONTEMPLATED IN THE BUDGET AND IN THOSE. CASES THE BUDGET TYPICALLY INCLUDES CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS TO GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOCATE- ON ANTICIPATED FEDERAL OR PRIVATE FUNDS. TO DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY CAN BE SPENT SO LONG AS THEY MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS- SPECIFICALLY THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE ON ANTICIPATED AT THE TIME OF THE BUDGET- THEY CAN ONLY BE SPENT FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES CONSISTENT WITH STATE LAW. AND THEY CAN'T IMPOSE A REQUIREMENT TO SPEND OTHER STATE FUNDS ON. FUNDS ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD CAN ONLY BE ALLOCATED DEPARTMENTS WITH A THIRTY DAY NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. HOWEVER THAT WAITING TIME CAN BE WAIVED- BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OFTEN HAS BEEN WITH RESPECT TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AND CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT IS BEEN USED TO ALLOCATE ROUGHLY SIX BILLION IN FUNDS RELATED TO. PROVIDE NINETEEN. THAT COVERS THE MAJOR- THIRTIES FOR EMERGENCY SPENDING I'M HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY DO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM. OKAY FIFTY. I HAVE A COUPLE OF WE DON'T HEAR FROM ANYBODY ELSE RIGHT- FINANCE THAT'S RIGHT THANK FINANCED. THANK YOU MANAGER CAN SEE BENTSEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE NOTHING SPECIFIC TO ADD TO THAT I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD COULD ARGUE WITH THE RECENT STORIES- AGES WOULD NOTED THAT- WE'RE WE'VE RECEIVED THE L. S. REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS WEEKEND SO WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THOSE- PRECIADO. IT INFORMATION PUT OUT- THIS MAKE UP A WE GET THROUGH TO THE- PROPOSED BUDGET CONTROL SECTIONS BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET A SORT OF A SUMMARY OF HOW ALL OF THESE- MECHANISMS- FOR SPENDING HAVE BEEN USED OVER THE LAST YEAR. OF WHAT WHAT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS BEEN USED THROUGH THIS- AND I NOTICED SOME OF COURSE ARE EVERYWHERE FROM. NO NOTICE TWO THREE DAYS NOTICE TO TEN DAYS TO THIRTY DAYS- THEY'RE ALL OVER. THERE ALL OVER THE LOT AND IT IT APPEARS THAT IT'S MOSTLY. NOTICE TO THE LEGISLATION THAT- BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT RIGHT IT'S NOT A THAT'S WHY THEY'RE MERGING SEA- THAT THEN THEY CAN JUST GET SPENT WITHOUT ANY KIND OF FURTHER APPROVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE SO IT'S NOTICED. I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET A PICTURE OF HOW MUCH AUTHORITY. IN TERMS OF AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HOW IT CAN BE SPENT WHERE DOES THE VOICE OF THE LEGISLATURE- COME INTO THIS PROCESS- BECAUSE THE- HE SAYS THEIR PIECES OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY. SORT OF BORED- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'D BE HAPPY TO SPEAK A BIT TO THAT- ONE PIECE OF CONTEXT THAT I THINK IS HELPFUL TO KNOW IS THAT ON WALL STATUTE SAYS THAT ONLY NOTIFICATION IS REQUIRED IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT- TYPICALLY IF JAIL B. C. RAISES OBJECTION TO SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOTIFYING THEM ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL OFTEN RECONSIDER IT THOUGH IT'S CRITICAL TO KNOW. THEY ARE NOT LEGALLY REQUIRED TO RECONSIDER IT SO IN SOME WAYS THAT CAN'T THAT DOES PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RAISE CONCERNS THAT CAN INFLUENCE THE PROCESS THOUGH AS I MENTIONED IT'S NOT REQUIRED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADHERE TO ANY OBJECTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT HAVE. IN TERMS OF THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE REALLY VARIES DEPENDING ON WHAT SPECIFIC AUTHORITY- YOU'RE YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT- WHEN IT COMES TO FOR EXAMPLE CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX. ARE THE MAIN ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE THERE WAS TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO MAKE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CONTROL SECTION AS WELL AS- TO OVERSEE IT THROUGH THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS- ON THAT SORT OF ONE ON ONE END OF THE EMERGENCY- SPENDING SPECTRUM ON THE OTHER END OF THE EMERGENCY SPEND. SPENDING SPECTRUM IS THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT WHICH REALLY CONTEMPLATES VERY LITTLE ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND AS WE TALK ABOUT FURTHER WE- WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF EMERGENCY SPENDING BE ADJUSTED TO CREATE. A GREATER ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THAT LATER IN TODAY'S HEARING OKAY- OKAY WILL HAVE MRE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- AND GENEROUSLY FRANK. ALL I'M SORRY AND THIS WAS GONNA ADD TO THAT IS DOUBLE THE- YEAH- SO JUST WANTED TO CURRENTLY HERE YOUR QUESTION LITTLE BIT ASKED AND ON HAVE BEEN ALEX THROUGH THE NECK. I AND EARLIER- THAT ABOUT EIGHT BILLION. HAS BEEN ALLOCATED THROUGH THE MECHANISMS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO THE MERCHANT SERVICES ACT SO UNDER THIRTEEN BILLION WITH ESTIMATED COST. ABOUT EIGHT MILLION HAS BEEN ALLOCATED THROUGH THE USE OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ACT ESSENTIALLY. THAT HAS ALL BEEN DONE. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SO ABOUT- SEVEN. FIVE SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION OF THAT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE THREE ALONG WITH THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT THAT MECHANISM ALL OF THE FUNDING WE'VE BEEN UTILIZING IT EMERGENCY ROOMS ACT SERVICES ACT HAS BEEN DONE THROUGH THE TRIO MECHANISM THE CODE NINETEEN OF LAST YEAR AND THAT HAS TOTALED ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND THE REMAINDER OF THAT- EIGHT POINT ONE ROUGHLY IS WHAT WAS DONE THROUGH THE CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX IN THE BUDGET AFTER THOSE NINETEEN AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF- APPROPRIATIONS THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BY STAFF. IN TERMS OF AMOUNTS THOSE ARE THE AMOUNTS. THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO THIS PROCESS. TERMS OF NEW. I THINK THE L. A. O. IS CORRECT IN THAT. THE STATUTE. OF THE BAR THAT IT SETS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S REQUIRED- IS PRETTY LOW BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. GONE WELL ABOVE. THAT BAR BY MAKING SURE THAT WE- DO WHAT'S REQUIRED NOTIFICATION LETTERS BUT WE'VE ALSO SET UP THE EVERY TWO MONTHS WILL UPDATES WE'VE DONE BRIEFINGS. AND THE L. O. U. S. HAS DONE- REGULAR BRIEFINGS WITH MEMBERS ON VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR. AS THINGS INVOLVED WITH CODE NINETEEN. AND FINANCES DONE- BRIEFINGS WITH NUMBERS. AS A NEW ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED INCOME FORWARD. AND THEN WE CONTINUE TO THE FISCAL SO I THINK THE IN THE ONLY WORK. WHICH IS ON THE STUDENTS ME THAT LIKE SUPER. WE GET THAT MANY PRECIADO MEDIA DISCUSS MORE. WITH LAW REQUIRES BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THIS CAN THAT ADMINISTRATION IS GOING WELL BEYOND JUST THAT BARE MINIMUM IS ALLEGED THAT THE LAW. REQUIRES YOU KNOWLEDGE IN THE NEED. TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW THAT. SOMETHING LIKE THE PANDEMIC THAT NOBODY HAS ANY IDEA FROM WEEK TO WEEK MONTH TO MONTH A LOT OF THINGS THAT WILL BE HAPPENING AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST THAT. MINISTRATIONS TRYING THEIR BEST. OF BUT WE ALL REPRESENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE- THE ISSUE COULD HAVE A DIFFERENT IMPACT. A DIFFERENT PART OF THE POPULATION IN THE RESIDENTS AND SO- IT IT REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE TO BE ABLE TO VOICE THAT. WE COULD SEE THAT EVERY IN EVERY ISSUE AND- IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- OKAY POLICE ANY OTHER ON THIS WE'LL WE'LL GET THROUGH THE- REST OF THE- FUNDING MECHANISMS AND AUTHORITY. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON THEN THAT'S THE- NUMBER. YOU SHOULD NINE. DO WE GO TO EVERY YEAR WE GET THAT OKAY ISSUE NO NINE ISSUE NINE OKAY YES LIST WAUKESHA NINE PLEASE. IN STEVEN APARTMENT- ISSUE NINE IS IN REGARDS TO CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. THAT WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT CONTROL SECTION INCLUDES TWO COMPONENTS THAT ARE BOTH AIMED AT FACILITATING ADAPTING THE STATE SCHOOL WOULD NINETEEN DIRECT RESPONSE FUNDING ANY. NEEDS AT THEIR FUNDING AS THE NEEDS OF ALSO MENTIONED. PREVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL INCLUDES ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THAT- PROPOSED IN ITEMS APPROPRIATION WITHIN SPECIFIC DEPARTMENT BUDGETS. THE FIRST COMPONENT OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. PROVIDES THE ABILITY FOR THE FUNDING TO BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THE ITEMS FOR RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND THE REASON BEHIND THAT PROPOSAL. IS THAT WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH THE THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IS THAT SOMETIMES THE DEPARTMENT THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE NEEDED TO SAY CONTRACT FOR A SIMPLE EXAMPLE PERHAPS SHOULD BE CONTRACTING FOR NURSING STAFF THAT'S BEEN USED FOR BOTH HOSPITAL MEDICAL SURGE IN THIS AND RECENTLY FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ADMINISTRATION. SO THOSE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY- HELD BY EITHER DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WERE THE ANSWER. AND SOMETIMES WHICH DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO BE IN A CONTRACT CAN CAN VERY SO THE IDEA BEHIND THIS PROVISION IN THE CONTROL SECTION IS TO SAY THAT IF WE WERE. REVERBERATED FUNDING FOR AN ACTIVITY IN STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT MS A NEEDS TO BE THE DEPARTMENT TO ENTER THE CONTRACT ACTUALLY EXPEND THE FUNDS. IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE FUNDING BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS IT WOULD BE FOR THE SAME ACTIVITIES BUT IT ALLOWS IT TO BE MOVED BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS IF THE DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURE CHANGES. AS THE ENDEMIC KIND OF EVOLVES. RESPONSE RESPONSES PENTECOST- IT ALSO WOULD ALLOW FOR THE- DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT THREE IN THOSE ITEMS I KNOW THAT IT DOES NOT. PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO INCREASE I THINK THAT'S WORTH NOTING BUT IT DOES ALLOW THAT. THE ABILITY TO DECREASE AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT IS TO SAY THAT. YOU KNOW WE KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR COST ESTIMATES ARE JUST THAT ESTIMATES- YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. THINGS WILL GO EVEN BETTER THAN THE ESTIMATES ASSUME AND MAYBE WE WON'T NEED TO SPEND ALL OF THE ESTIMATED FUNDING. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE IT WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO REMOVE SOME OF THAT FORTY FROM DEPARTMENTS BUDGETS IF IT'S NOT IF IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THERE. BASED ON HOW THAT THE ENDEMIC EVOLVES. THE SECOND COMPONENT OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE IS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FEDERAL AND PRIVATE FUNDS- MR SODERBERGH- LOOTED EARLIER TO- THERE FREQUENTLY pCOMES. AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF THE PERIOD WITHIN THE BUDGET CAN ANTICIPATE- CONTEMPLATE. THIS INCLUSION- NORMALLY THAT WOULD BE HANDLED THROUGH CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT I THINK. WE PROPOSED THIS PORTION OF A LOT CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE- BECAUSE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT KIND OF TYPICALLY IS CONTEMPLATING IN A ONE OFF DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC INCREASES AND GENERALLY NOT TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE A LARGE FEDERAL PACKAGE LIKE THE KERRS ACTOR OTHER THINGS THAT COME OUT NOT THAT IT COULDN'T BE ADAPTED TO. BE USED THAT WAY BUT OUR PERSPECTIVE WAS THAT. WITH THE PANDEMIC LONG THIS FUNDING IS COMING IN FOR ACTIVITIES THAT NEED TO BE. ROLLED OUT FIRST WANTED TO IMMEDIATELY AND THE SCALE IN TERMS OF BOTH THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS IMPACTED AND THE RELATIVELY LARGE SO WE PROPOSED THIS CONTROL SECTION AS A ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF. BEING ABLE TO MAKE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR SPECIFIC PERSON PURPOSES. AVAILABLE FOR THOSE SPECIFIC PURPOSES- A LITTLE BIT MORE SWIFTLY- THE CRITERIA OF CONDITIONS THAT NEED TO BE MET. FOR THIS CONTROL SECTION BE USED ARE VERY SIMILAR. TO CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT SO IT STILL REQUIRES THAT IT THE FUNDS THAT ARE- BEING EXPENDED SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO COVERT NINETEEN. I WOULD REQUIRE THAT THEY BE CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. WE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE FUNDS ARE BEING PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY FOR AND ARE BEING EXPANDED SPECIFICALLY FOR. THE NINETEEN- AND THEN FINALLY- IT HAS TO BE REQUIRES THAT THE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT REQUIRE THE STATE TO COMMIT OR EXPAND IN ANY OTHER STATE FUNDS. SO VERY SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS OR CONDITIONS TO CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT- OUR THOUGHT PROCESS ON THIS COMPONENT AGAIN WHICH WAS TO ALLOW FOR. A WAY TO BRING IN AND USE QUICKLY WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE CAN BE LARGER THAN THE TYPICALLY- INTUBATED TYPE OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE LIKE THE CARS AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT IF IT WERE IF ANOTHER PACKAGE WOULD COME. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE LA- PLEASE. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ON SO THE FIRST COMPONENT ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE THAT ALLOWS THE ADMINISTRATION TO SHIFT FUNDS BETWEEN TWELVE DEPARTMENTS- WHAT MADE MY COMMENTS WILL BE FOCUSED ON THAT FIRST WEEK WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO PROVIDE THE ADMINISTRATION SOME FLEXIBILITY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT ON KNOWN ABOUT THE PANDEMIC. HOWEVER WE FEEL THAT THIS SECTION PROVIDES SO MUCH FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO KNOW HOW BUDGETED FUNDS WILL ACTUALLY BE SPENT OR EVEN WHICH DEPARTMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY RECEIVE THE FUNDS AS THE CONTROL SECTION DOES NOT REQUIRE A NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT. IN OUR IN ADDITION THE SECTION ALLOWS FUNDS TO BE PROVIDED TO THREE DEPARTMENTS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING RESEARCH THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES AUTHORITY. AND THE MILITARY DEPARTMENT WHOSE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES HAVEN'T BEEN IDENTIFIED YET AS SUCH THE LEGISLATURE ONE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE USED IF THEY WERE PROVIDED TO THOSE DEPARTMENTS- ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE SECTION. TO REQUIRE THE LEGISLATURE TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN FUNDS ARE TRANSFERRED AND BE PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT- HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED WHEN THEY'RE TRANSFERRED. WITH RESPECT TO THE SECOND COMPONENT THAT GIVES THE ADMINISTRATION FLEXIBILITY TO RECEIVE. FEDERAL AND PRIVATE FUNDS WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS COMPONENT OF CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINE ONE- BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF WHAT'S REALLY ALREADY A VERY VERY BROAD AUTHORITY UNDER CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT- WE- ARE UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOME OF THE FOUGHT BEHIND- THE CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINE ONE FLEXIBILITY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS. WAS THAT IT WOULD EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. BUT WE REALLY FIND THAT THERE'S NO NEED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS- BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE UNDER CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT- THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO NOTE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINE ONE AND CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT IS ELEVEN NINE ONE WOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION. WORDS CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT WOULD IF IT'S A BUT IF IT'S FUNDING ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD. ON AND SO WE FEEL THAT THE CURRENT PROCESS IS SUFFICIENT PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IT HAS SAFEGUARDS BUILT IN TO ALLOW FOR EXPEDITED APPLICATIONS AS NECESSARY AND THOSE THOSE- EXPEDITED ALLOCATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THROUGHOUT THAT CODE NINETEEN. PANDEMIC AS NEEDED. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF SO ALONG THOSE LINES IF WE COULD GET THE DEPARTMENT OF- FINANCE BUT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH USING THE EXISTING BUDGET CONTROL SECTIONSTO. ALLOCATE OR REALLOCATE ON GENERAL FUND MONEY. SO WE FOUND IN VARIOUS THINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT- SOME OF THE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES REQUIRED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE W WERE COMING FROM WHERE POSING A LOAN POINT NINE WONDER THAT THAT COMPONENT. END OF IT IS THAT IT ALLOWS FOR A MORE IMMEDIATE. USE OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING AS THEY COME IN THAT WAS THAT'S LARGELY THE AND THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER- I THINK TYPICALLY CONSTRUCTION TWENTY EIGHT OF THE BUDGET ACT. TYPICALLY DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE- I THINK ASK FEDERAL PACKAGES OF THE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW THAT YOU MAY GET FROM CODE NINETEEN NINETY CAN THINK WITH CARES ACT NUMBER DEPARTMENTS IMPACTED IN THAT AND THE SIZE OF THE AMOUNT THAT COMES IN- AND THEN AGAIN BAKER SAID BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE IT ON A- MEDIA BASIS FOR IMMEDIATE NEEDS. AND COVERED THAT WAS THE CONTEXT WERE COMING FROM- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE WE WERE DRAFTING THIS CONTROL SECTION IN MID DECEMBER- WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TO FACE- AND THE MOST RECENT SURGE WE HAD AND THE OTHERS. AND CONTINUED UNCERTAINTIES ONE WAY SO WE'RE COMING FROM A CONTEXT AND IS WELL. OF THE MEDIA. MEDIA ATTENTION NEEDED THEIR- I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE CA SEX WELL IT DOESN'T SPECIFY- NOTIFICATION. EXPECTATIONS THE MINISTRATION- OUR THOUGHT PROCESS WAS THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW FUNDING WAS SHIFTED IN PROVIDED AND USE OF. THE FEDERAL FUNDING AUTHORITY. PORTION OF THAT YOU ARE A REGULAR FISCAL UPDATES AND BRIEFINGS PROCESSES THAT WE'VE DONE WE ANTICIPATE TO CONTINUE DOING THOSE THINGS AND SO THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE TO CONTINUE USING TO SHARE THE INFORMATION. SO IN TERMS OF WHY ARE YOU ASKING FOR THIS BROADER THE AUTHORITY. WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION YOU THINK THAT THEIR REPORTS EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS WOULD COVER THAT. I MENTIONED EARLIER TYPICALLY WHEN WE'RE DOING ANY SORT OF NEW ACTIVITY WE HAVE BRIEFINGS AND HOLD DISCUSSIONS WITH MEMBERS AND STAFF PRIOR TO LAUNCHING THOSE ACTIVITIES- RIGHT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO THINK THAT ACTIVITY ON THAT LEVEL OF CONGESTION NOTIFICATION INVOLVEMENT. MADAM CHAIR IF I IF I GET A YES MR SODERBERGH. ON WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE AN EXPLICIT NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT- DIDN'T TO MAKE NOTIFICATION EXPLICITLY REQUIRED BECAUSE THAT ENSURES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL GET THE INFORMATION. IT FINDS TO BE NECESSARY IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS OFTEN EXCEEDED- THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION PROVIDED BUT WE THINK THAT- THERE'S NO HARM IN REQUIRING THE INFORMATION BE PROVIDED AND WE THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. THAT THIS INFORMATION BE PROVIDED RELATED TO LARGE FEDERAL FUNDS AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK THE CONTROL SECTION TWENTY EIGHT PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES THAT NOTIFICATION- WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO THE- ELEVEN NINE ONE PROCESS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- COLLEAGUES. NINETY YES SENATE QUARTERS. THANK YOU BUILT YOUR RADIO MIGHT. MY LEAN ON THIS EARLY SO THE FIRST IS THAT EITHER ELEVEN NINETY ONE SHOULD REPLICATE THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND TWENTY EIGHT AS AS A MINIMUM OR- OR THE- IT SHOULD JUST BE DETERMINED AT TWENTY EIGHT. IS THE RULE- THAT SAID GO. A. I. BASED ON SOME THINKING- AND I AND I APPRECIATE MR BENTSEN YOUR YOUR CANDOR REGARDING. YOU KNOW PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN DECEMBER- YOU KNOW ALL THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC YOU KNOW I THINK WE'VE HEARD POLICYMAKERS SAY YOU KNOW THE LAST MONTH OR TWO MONTHS AGO WAS- LIKE A DIFFERENT WORLD BUT WE WERE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD- IN IN. A THINK OF. WHERE WE WERE IN DECEMBER. IN WHERE WE ARE NOW IT IS REMARKABLY DIFFERENT IN A GOOD WAY- IN MANY WAYS- SO I CAN ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR MISTER BENSON AND YOU KNOW REPEATEDLY USING. THE WORD SOME YOU KNOW SOME ROLL UP USED TO BE DONE IMMEDIATELY- I THINK THAT'S A GOOD WAY WHICH THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW ABOUT THE SOME. THINGS THAT DON'T NEED TO BE ROLLED OUT IMMEDIATELY BUT ARE PART OF- ALONG A LONGER GAME. SO TO SPEAK NO THIS IS A GAME BUT A LONGER. APPROACH A LONGER RANGE APPROACH THAT WOULD BE STEEPED IN POLICY THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE TAKEN UP BILLS SUCH AS SB NINETY ONE AND JUST- THIS MORNING S. B. EIGHTY SIX WHICH- WHICH COMPLEMENT THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH- IN TERMS OF REOPENING- RELOCATING- TENANTS BACK ON THEIR FEET LANDLORDS BACK ON THEIR FEET IN THE FIRST CASE OR- WITH EIGHTY SIX- OBVIOUSLY. OUR SCHOOLS REOPENED- THERE'S AN URGENCY- BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT INTERMEDIACY OF THAT TO THAT APPROACH. CONVERSELY IF YOU WERE TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT TO ME. WITH YOU KNOW UNDER EITHER ELEVEN NINETY ONE OR TWENTY EIGHT TAXI ROLLOUT. SHOULD SHOULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY MINIMAL LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE NEED TO MOVE ON THAT. YESTERDAY SO TO SPEAK- WE IT'S OF EXTREME. URGENCY AND- THE IMMEDIACY OF MAKING DECISIONS ON HOW TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT- AND PAY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION FOR THAT TO ME. HAS A MUCH GREATER URGENCY BUT ALL OF ALL THAT SPEAKS TO THE TIME THAT WERE IN WORK. WE SEEM TO BE LEAVING. THANK GOD- A- A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING- UNDER UNDER THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION NEEDED TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE INTO BASICALLY A NEW REALITY NOW WHERE. WE'RE WE'RE ENTERING RECONSTRUCTION RE OPENING IN- YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST BY AN ELEGY IS NOT A GOOD ANALOGY BUT- YOU KNOW IF WE WERE FIFTH AT THE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO ARGUING ABOUT THE WAR POWERS ACT WHETHER OR NOT. THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACT NOW- IN THE CASE OF. YOU KNOW A GLOBAL EMERGENCY WHICH THIS IS- IN AND AT WHAT POINT DO YOU ENTER A RECONSTRUCTION PHASE SORT OF A MARTIAL HACK PHASE WHERE. FRANKLY POLICY- IS OF HUGE IMPORTANCE NEW ONCE BECOMES IMPORTANT DOESN'T MEAN THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE. HOLDING BACK FOR MONTHS AT A TIME BUT- EIGHT AT LIKE TO HEAR WHETHER OR NOT THE L. A. O. PROTECTOR FEELS THAT. GIVEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IN WHETHER CO AILES- OPINION THAT. WOULD BE EXPENDITURES FORTHCOMING TO BE ESSENTIALLY SPLIT INTO THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THOSE THAT. HOME ARE IMMEDIATE IN THOSE- WHERE THERE WILL BE TIME FOR- A LITTLE BIT MORE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS TO BE APPLIED. IN THE- WITH THAT- OCCURRED LIKE TO ALSO UNDERSTAND PROCEDURALLY WHETHER YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS HAPPENED THAT THE NOTIFICATIONS UNDER. THESE CONTROL SECTIONS BASICALLY LEFT TO. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE. BUDGET COMMITTEE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM GETTING NOTIFICATIONS BUT WHAT I DO UNDERSTAND. IS WHAT SEEMS LIKE A DISCONNECT WITH WITH THE RULES COMMITTEE PROCESS IN OUR SYSTEM IT SEEMS LIKE. IF YOU'RE IF THINGS ARE HAPPENING QUICKLY. AND NOTIFICATIONS NEED TO HAPPEN THAT IN OUR SYSTEM THEY WOULD WE WOULD WANT THEM TO GO TO RULES THE RULES COMMITTEE AND WHAT THE RULES COMMITTEE DISPATCH OUT MAKE THE DECISIONS AS TO WHO NEEDS TO BE BRIEF WHICH COMMITTEES OR SUBCOMMITTEES NEED TO BE CONVENE I MEAN IT'S REALLY THE RULES COMMITTEE IN OUR SYSTEM. THAT SETS THE AGENDA FOR THAT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT PROCESS OR POLICY PROCESS SO. I GUESS. I'M I'M STARTING TO LOOK SORT OF LEAN INTO. OF A POSITION THAT. WE NEED NOTIFICATION ADAM AT A MINIMUM- NOT A LACK OF IF IT PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO. JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE IT SHOULD ALSO BE SORT OF- RACKET THAT RULES COMMITTEE AS WELL IN CASE. THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES LIKE THIS ONE RATHER- OR OTHERS NEED TO BE CONVENE BUT IF I CAN JUST NOW TO THE CHURCH GET BACK TO THE L. A. AND- JUST ASK FOR YOUR PERCEPTION OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS IN TERMS OF THIS NEED FOR IMMEDIACY OR NOT. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THEY'RE THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME EXPENDITURES. THAT NEED TO BE DONE ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS- AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT AND IN THE NEXT SECTION I WILL OUTLINE A SERIES OF REFORMS THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE- THAT WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S SOME SPENDING THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR ON AN IMMEDIATE BASIS. WE THINK EVEN IN THOSE CASES LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION IS APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO SPENDING- THAT- NEEDS TO BE SUBJECT TO GREATER LEGISLATIVE REFLECTION PARTICULARLY IN CASES WHERE THERE'S SORT OF. LARGE AMOUNTS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCIES THAT AREN'T NEEDED ON A PRICING BASIS AND IN THOSE CASES WE THINK THAT. THE LONGER NOTIFICATION TIME. ALLOWING THE- THE LEGISLATURE GREATER TIME TO REFLECT ON IT AND PROVIDED INPUT TO THE ADMINISTRATION ARE APPROPRIATE- IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE- JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE RULES COMMITTEE- THE LEGISLATURE E. AS A LEGISLATURE YOU'D BE ABSOLUTELY. FREE TO SET UP WHATEVER SORT OF NOTIFICATION PROCESS SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO YOU. TRADITIONALLY MADE YOUR BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS ARE. REVIEWED BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND THAT'S- WHY SOME OF THE ONES CREATED FOR KOBE AND PROBABLY ARE. USING. THAT SORT OF SET STRUCTURE. FROM HERE BUT YOU CAN HAVE. INTERNET I DIFFERENT STRUCTURE OFTENTIMES THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- IS PUT IN THE PLACE OF- DOING IN THE REVIEWS THE NOTIFICATIONS- SO THAT THERE'D BE A COMMITTEE AVAILABLE. TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT EVEN IN CASES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS OUT OF SESSION BECAUSE OFTENTIMES EMERGENCY SPENDING WILL NEED TO TAKE PLACE AND THAT AND SO THE IDEA IS HAVING A- SMALLER COMMITTEE- TAKE TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE AND BE ABLE TO. REVIEW THOSE NOTIFICATIONS WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDING TO BE IN SESSION BUT CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE FREE TO CREATE WHAT'S OR WHATEVER SORT OF REVIEW AND NOTIFICATION PROCESS- EIGHTEENS TO BE APPROPRIATE JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST DOESN'T. TIE THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD. THROUGH THE TOURNAMENT A THE ONE BELABOR THE POINT BUT I AM HOPING YOU UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION I'M MAKING I I'M ALL FOR THE NIMBLENESS OF. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- BUT PART OF THEIR PER IS MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER. OTHERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN OVERSIGHT ONLY ONLY THE RULES COMMITTEE IN OUR SYSTEM. OF CAN. SORT OF PLAY QUARTERBACK TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS- IN IN THE SYSTEM AND I'M- IT WOULD IS THAT TRUE WORD OR DO YOU. IS YOUR UNDERSTAND OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. ONE THAT THAT THAT PART OF THE RESPONSIBILITY IS TO IS TO NOT JUST PROCESSES NOTIFICATIONS TO MAKE DECISIONS AND SEND MESSAGES BACK WITH YOU MINISTRY SHOULD ALSO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER OR NOT- OTHERS IN THE LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE CONVENE. EQUITIES IF I COULD- I MIGHT BE ON OFFER A CLARIFICATION AS WELL. SO I JUST I WANTED TO NOTE AND IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS THAT WHEN THESE NOTIFICATIONS ARE SENT TO THE JOINT WILL JUST LITTLE BUDGET COMMITTEE THEY'RE ALSO SENT TO BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEES AND COMMITTEES ON APPROPRIATIONS. SO I JUST TO CLARIFY IT'S NOT JUST JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET ME TO GET SOMETHING THEY GO TO MULTIPLE COMMITTEES WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING THE BUDGET COMMITTEES. AND THE OTHER THING IS- ONE AND WANTED TO NOTE- SORRY I JUST IN MY BIKE SO I KNOW ALL THE WITH THAT BUT YEAH IF YOU JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KNEW THAT THE OTHER COMMITTEES WERE ALSO GETTING- GETTING THESE NOTIFICATIONS AS WELL THAT'S HELPFUL NOT ONLY STARTED. THE CITY I THINK I WOULD I WAS GONNA NOTICE I'M SORRY YOUR EXAMPLES IN EARLY ON WERE ACTUALLY GOOD I THINK ILLUSTRATE EXAMPLES OF. HOW THE MINISTRATIONS APPROACH- IN TERMS OF IMMEDIACY- HAS BEEN HAS BEEN GOING SO. AGAIN NOTING THAT. THE PACKAGE ON RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE. WHAT FOR IT IS KIND OF EARLY ACTION NEEDED ACTION BUDGET REQUEST. I THINK IT'S IN REFLECTION YOU KNOW- KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THOSE WERE THINGS THAT YEAH THERE PORTANTINO NEED TO GET DONE QUICKLY BUT- YOUR WEBSITE IS IN SESSION WERE IN A BUDGET. OUT PROCESS. AND WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT AND THAT'S THE ROUTE THAT WAS USED. WE TRY AND USE THE OTHER ROUTES IT'S PRIMARILY THE TRUE A ROUTE- FOR THINGS THAT ARE DISTINCTLY IMMEDIATE NEED. EMERGENCY RESPONSE THINGS AND THEN I THINK IS AS MR SODERBERGH ALLUDED TO LIKE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT IN SESSION. AND THINGS NEED TO BE REACTIVE TO AND RESPONDED. TO AND SO WE TRYING YOU SLICE AND THAT WAY AGAIN THE FRAMEWORK FOR A B. C. P. THIS YEAR WAS. TO TRY AND REFLECT THAT BALANCE OF WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS IN SESSION AND NOT EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING. ANY TO DO IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IS LIKE IMMEDIATE. ACTION STUFF WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE THE REGULAR BUDGET. PROCESS AND WE'RE TRYING TO UTILIZE THE REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE- AND THEN BALANCING THAT WITH THE CASES WHERE WE CAN OPERATE. RECOGNIZE ARE ANTICIPATE. THERE WILL BE THINGS OUTSIDE THE BUDGET PROCESS THAT WILL STILL REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION IN THE IN YOUR EXACT APPLE OF. FAXING DISTRIBUTION IS X. IS RIGHT. ON LIKE THAT'S EXACTLY THE TYPE OF THING WHERE. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE A TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY- TO HELP. HEALTH IF THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE AND THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. JUST JUST ALONG THOSE LINES- THE WE'VE NEVER USE THESE EMERGENCY OF THIS EMERGENCY AUTHORITY- IN A SOME IN A SITUATION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF A SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WE HAD TO RESPOND TO IT WHERE THERE WAS A FIRE IS THAT NOBODY EXPECTED AMIT HAPPENED THAT'S BEEN LET'S GO IN AND FIX AND HELP- A NURSE QUICK YOU KNOW YOU GO IN IT'S A BIG THING THAT HAPPENED WE HAVE TO. RESPOND WE HAVE TO HELP. THIS IS NOW A YEAR AFTER- HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE STARTED TO RESPOND TO. TO THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE AND EVERY TIME WE SPEND DOLLARS IT'S A REFLECTION OF A POLICY IT'S NO LONGER JUST. LET'S GO IN AND SPEND THE MONEY THAT'S NEEDED TO HELP PEOPLE THIS IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF A POLICY SO THOSE ARE MY- CONCERNS AS FAR AS- OF THE KIND OF NOTICE THAT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE- RESPONSIBLE FOR. AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT BY REFLECTING ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS ART ARE PART OF THE STATE AND PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER SO THAT WE COULD SPEND THE DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES- ARE DISTRICTS BUT ALSO THE WHOLE STATE SO- IT'S A YEAR LATER. WE'VE LEARNED A LOT- STILL DON'T KNOW WHERE WHAT THIS IS GONNA THIS IS GOING TO MEET IN OUR AND OUR COMMUNITIES BUT- WE HAVE A SENSE OF IT AND NOW WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK. WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE FROM WHERE WE WERE A YEAR AGO WE GAVE THAT KIND OF- ACCORDING. THE THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH- WE'RE GOING TO ISSUE. TEN RIGHT OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE TEN BUDGET CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN NINETY TWO. LOGIN STEVEN BENSON WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE- CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO. REVISE FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR ANTICIPATED COSTS RELATED TO COVER NINETEENTH AS I NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE BUDGET PACKAGE THE ADMINISTRATION PUT FORWARD. INCLUDES ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ESTIMATED COSTS THAT WE DON'T YET HAVE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO KNOW EXACTLY WHICH DEPARTMENTS WOULD NEED TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURES AND SO WE HAVE PROPOSED TO MAKE THE THREE- I THOUGHT MECHANISM. AND CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THAT WE COULD ADMINISTER AND THAT FUNDING AND CAN OR ANY OTHER KIND OF SORT OF UNKNOWN UNANTICIPATED THINGS THAT WOULD COME UP SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE. SO FAR. M. OKAY. WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER BENSON- THE L. A- PLEASE. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO GIVEN THE SCALE AND THE NATURE OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE DO THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE THE GOVERNOR FLEXIBILITY TO- SPEND ON THE BILL. PANDEMIC BUT I THINK AS OUR DISCUSSION HAS HIGHLIGHTED WE THINK THAT THERE ADDITIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT NEED TO BE PLACED ON THIS FLEXIBILITY ON EVERYTHING THESE CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE APPROPRIATE NOT ONLY FOR COVERT NINETEEN BUT REALLY FALL FUTURE STATE EMERGENCIES BECAUSE MANY OF THE- SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES SUCH AS THOSE UNDER SEASIDE- IT WOULD APPLY TO ALL STATE EMERGENCIES AND REALLY PROVIDE VERY LITTLE ROLE FOR LEGISLATIVE. OVERSIGHT SO TO ADDRESS THAT BOTH THE THAT PROBLEM BOTH AS IT APPLIES TO COPE WITH NINETEEN AND OTHER STATE EMERGENCIES. WE RECOMMEND A SERIES OF STATUTORY CHANGES- TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH GREATER OVERSIGHT EMERGENCY SPENDING- FIRST WE'D RECOMMEND REQUIRING ALL EMERGENCY AUGMENTATIONS COME FROM THREE- THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL AUGMENTATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS- WE KNOW THAT WE WOULD STILL. UNDER OUR RECOMMENDATION ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO USE ITS POWERS UNDER C. SAID TO REDIRECT FUNDS BUT IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE DEPARTMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION WE NEED TO DO A HOT DEPOSITED THREE OFFERS. AS MR BENTSEN DESCRIBED EARLIER THIS IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING- THIS WOULD SORT OF ENSURE THAT THE- ALLOCATIONS PROVIDED TO DEPARTMENTS LIKE I SAID ARE. SUBJECT TO ALL THE SAME REQUIREMENTS. THIS CHANGE WITH RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ESTABLISH AN AMOUNT FOR DARIO AND THE BUDGET. THIS WOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE INPUT INTO THE LEVEL OF FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY EXPENDITURES. IT WOULD ALSO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE THAT EMERGENCY SPINE- SPENDING ENDS UP UNDERMINING. THE STATE BUDGET STRUCTURE OR CONDITION FROM OR TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S NECESSARY THAT'S THAT SPENDING- DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE BUDGT THE LEGISLATURE IS- INVOLVED AT THE FRONT ABOUT THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY SPENDING. THE THIRD CHANGE WE'D RECOMMEND IS REQUIRING ADVANCE NOTIFICATION TO TRANSFER FUNDS INTO TRIO- SEVEN SOME YEARS OF THE ADMINISTRATION MAY NEED TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT BUDGETED INJURY- AND TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AS PART OF THIS DECISION WE- DEMAND THAT START TO BE CHANGED TO. REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ADVANCE NOTIFICATION TO JAIL BC. THEN THE NOTIFICATIONS WOULD. BE A DIFFERENT TYPES DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION- FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD ESTABLISH A SHORTER NOTIFICATION PERIOD FOR SMALLER TRANSFERS THAT ARE TIED TO ONGOING EMERGENCIES. FOR EXAMPLE THIS COULD BE A SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTIFICATION- THIS WOULD BE REASONABLE SINCE THE AMOUNTS WOULD BE SMALL THE EMERGENCY WOULD BE ONGOING AND THEREFORE VERY LIKELY TO BE URGENT. AND WOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY SPECIFIC DETAILS. ON HOW THE DOLLARS WOULD BE SPENT. FROM WE WOULD RECKON IS DOUBLE A- NO. PERIOD FOR LARGER TRANSFERS OR TRANSFERS THAT ARE MADE PROACTIVELY BEFORE EMERGENCIES- THIS GETS BACK TO- THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR CORTESE ASKED AS TO WHETHER THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME FUNDING THAT'S URGENT AND SOME FUNDING THAT. LAST SURGEON THIS WOULD FALL INTO THE LESS URGENT CATEGORY- AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THERE BE A THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE DAY NOTIFICATION PROCESS TO ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO CONDUCT MORE OVERSIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE CONVENE. A BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING TO WEIGH WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE THING TO DO- HOWEVER IN ALL CASES WE DO. RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO REQUEST A WAIVER OF THE NOTIFICATION TIME FRAME- IF URGENT CIRCUMSTANCES ARISE- SUCH AS IF THERE IS A NEED TO SPEND. FUNDS IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF LIFE OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY- UNDER THESE CASES OF JAIL B. C. APPROVED THE WAIVER THE FUNDS WOULD BE EITHER TRANSFERRED IMMEDIATELY. OR UNDER WHATEVER SHORTEN TIME FRAME WAS SPECIFIED BY JAIL BC. ANOTHER CHANGE WE RECOMMEND IS THAT- THERE BE INCREASED REPORTING ON DRIEL ALLOCATIONS AND EXPENDITURES- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WE HAVE SAID A COUPLE TIMES IN TODAY'S HEARINGS THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ABSOLUTELY EXCEEDED. THE LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED BY STATUTE THROUGHOUT COULD NINETEEN NONETHELESS WE STILL THINK THAT THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDED IS INADEQUATE FOR A CHAT- TO. UNDERTAKE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THE NINETEEN EXPENDITURES. SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE NOTIFIED WHEN ALLOCATIONS ARE MADE FROM THREE OO TO DEPARTMENTS- THIS WOULD BE DONE AT THE TIME THE ALLOCATION IS MADE AND THEN THIS WOULD BE- THE NOTIFICATION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE SPECIFIC INFORMATION LIKE THE AMOUNT BEING TRANSFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE SPECIFIC USES IT WOULD BE USED FOR. WE ALSO RECOMMEND EXPLICITLY REQUIRING IN STATUTE THAT MONTHLY REPORTS BE GENERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALL PLANNED AN ACTUAL SPENDING. THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL EMERGENCIES. AND WHAT OUTLINED THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS ALLOCATED FROM REAL WORLD FEDERAL FUNDS PRIVATE FUNDS AS WELL AS EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS BUDGETED FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE FOR FUNDS THAT ARE REDIRECTED UNDER C. SO AT THE READY- IN IT IN ADDITION TO JUST DESCRIBING. THE AMOUNTS OF FUNDS WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THIS REPORT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES FUNDED. SO IF ALL OF THE SAFEGUARDS THAT I MENTIONED WERE PUT IN PLACE- WE THINK THAT IT COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EXPAND THE USE OF THREE- UPPER CODE NINETEEN THROUGH THE END OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WELL POSITIONED TO. EXECUTE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THAT CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE. HOWEVER WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT GREATER INVOLVEMENT GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CODE NINETEEN SPENDING. IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER INSTEAD REJECTING CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO AND CREATING A DIFFERENT BUDGET CONTROL SECTION PROCESS. TO ALLOCATE CODE NINETEEN FUNDS WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS DONE THROUGH CONTROL SECTION THIRTY SIX. IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SPECIFY THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE. AND OUTLINED THE PROCESS TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS THROUGH NOTIFICATIONS PROVIDED TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE- AND IN THIS CASE. THE THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR CODE SPENDING COULD ONLY BE CHANGED IF THERE WAS AN AMENDMENT TO THE BUDGET ACT AND SO THAT WOULD PUT CONSIDERABLY. MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THE TWELVE MONTHS SPENT ON CORPORATE NINETEEN. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WENT ON THE FACT THAT WENT BEHIND THAT- DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANT TO RESPOND OR HAVE ANY COMMENTS. ABOUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MISTER BENSON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT NOW YOU JUST VERY BRIEFLY. YEAH SO LIKE AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE STILL REVIEWING THE REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS- THAT YOU JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT AND- WE JUST NOTE PRELIMINARILY THAT TO THE EXTENT ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS LIMITS THE STATE'S ABILITY. TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TO DISASTER EVENTS WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE NOW THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN WOULD LIKELY LIE- BUT WE DO REALLY APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW THAT THE LAW TELESALES REPEAT KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPEARED TO YOU KNOW NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND INFORMATION SHARING AND LAW AND EXCEEDED THAT MANY CASES AND- AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE VERY OPEN TO. HAVING THE DISCUSSION IN CONTINUING THEIR DISCUSSION BASED ON REPORT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE NEW UNDER ANY JUSTICE IS A COMMON ENEMY INTO THE KNOWLEDGE OF. THE COVERED NATURE OF THE OF THE PRESENTERS THEMSELVES- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS A LITTLE BIT IN THE ABSTRACT IN MY OPINION- IT% TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE BUDGET CONTROL SECTIONS ARE ARE THERE LONG TERM TO ENSURE A TO YOUR EARLIER COMMENTS ABOUT. WHAT WE DEALING WITH MAX AND AT WHAT TIME AND WHAT FUTURE ADMINISTRATION EARTHQUAKE- FIRES AGAIN FLOOD- IT'S NOT PERSONAL TO WHETHER OR NOT- RIGHT NOW- THE ADMINISTRATION IF YOU KNOW IN OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN DOING A STELLAR JOB OF KEEPING THE LEGISLATURE INFORMED OR- APPLY GOD JUDGMENT TO IT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IS A BLACK LETTER SET OF RULES THAT WE PASS ON TO OTHERS OURSELVES. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THAT THAT WOULD SURVIVE EVEN OUR OVERSIGHT IN OUR JURISDICTION ALSO THAT SOMEDAY SOMEBODY'S NOT A SITUATION- YOU KNOW WHERE. AN EXECUTIVE ISN'T- SO GENEROUS WITH YOU KNOW WITH HER THEIR COLLABORATIVE NATURE SO I JUST WANTED TO. SAY THAT IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IN EXPLAINED PERHAPS- WHY- FROM EXPRESSING CONCERNS THAT THEY GIVE THANK YOU.

AN SO WE'RE MOVING NOW TO THE TOP OF THE AGENDA BACK TO ISSUES ONE THROUGH NINE- WE'RE GOING. TO GO TO ISSUE ONE OF THE OVERSIGHT ITEM WHICH IS THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL SPECIAL REVIEW OF THE CDC OURS NEW PROCEDURE FOR HANDLING GRIEVANCES INVOLVING STAFF MISCONDUCT. MISTER INSPECTOR GENERAL. MISTER WESLEY GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD I'M ROY WESLEY THE CALIFORNIA INSPECTOR GENERAL THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO BRIEF YOU ON THE O. I. G. REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION'S PROCESS FOR REVIEWING AND INVESTIGATING. INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND THE FORMATION OF THE NEW UNIT TO HANDLE SUCH ALLEGATIONS THE NEW UNIT IS CALLED THE ALLEGATION ENQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION FOR GAMES FOR SHORT. THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS THAT WE LOOKED AT CAME ABOUT AS A RESULT OF A REVIEW MY OFFICE COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AT SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND THE PRISON LAW OFFICE ASKED US TO LOOK AT HOW THE GRIEVANCES WERE PROCESSED. AT SALINAS VALLEY STATE PRISON. WE FOUND A SYSTEM THAT WAS UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY BROKEN. THE INCREASE CONDUCTED BY INSTITUTIONAL STAFF AT SALINAS VALLEY WERE RIFE WITH BOTCHED INTERVIEWS OFFICER BIAS AND NO SEMBLANCE OF FAIRNESS. AS A RESULT WE MADE A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS. TO BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE. THESE RECOMMENDED THESE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT INCLUDED REMOVE WARDENS AND INSTITUTIONAL STAFF FROM THIS PROCESS. REGIONALI IS THE PROCESS JUST AS THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS HAS REGIONAL ICED ITS STAFF MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. USE TRAINED INVESTIGATORS TO COMPLETE THESE ENQUIRIES AND CREATE AN AUDIT FUNCTION TO ENSURE DISCIPLINARY ACTION RESULTING FROM ENQUIRIES WAS ACTUALLY APPLIED. AFTER OUR SALINAS VALLEY REPORT WAS ISSUED THE DEPARTMENT PROFESSED TO AGREE WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTED THAT THE INCREASE WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE INSTITUTIONS AND THAT THE WARDENS AND INSTITUTIONAL STAFF WOULD NOT BE INVOLVED. IN THE PROCESS. FOLLOWING OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SALINAS VALLEY REPORT THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED MONEY TO CREATE AND STAFF THE AMES UNIT. JAMES WAS SET UP TO BE A REGIONAL ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS TO PROVIDE A CADRE OF PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATORS TO INVESTIGATE INCARCERATED PERSONS COMPLAINTS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT OUTSIDE THE COMMAND STRUCTURE OF THE PRISONS. IN THE 200-019-2000 TWENTY BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTED AND WAS GRANTED FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS AND NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING FUNDING. THE DEPARTMENT STOOD UP AIMS TO CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS. IN THEIR REQUEST FOR FUNDING THE DEPARTMENT PROMISED THAT THE AIMS UNIT WOULD PERFORM FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR INCREASE PER MONTH. EQUALING FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY INCREASE PER YEAR. THE ALLEGATION INQUIRY MANAGEMENT SECTION BECAME FULLY OPERATIONAL ON APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. IN ADDITION OUR STATUTE THE O. I. G. STATUTE WAS AMENDED TO DIRECT THE ORGY TO MONITOR AND REPORT ON AIMS. IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE ISSUED OUR FIRST REPORT. UNFORTUNATELY AS OUR LATEST REPORT DOCUMENTS THESE PROBLEM PROMISES WERE NOT FULFILLED. BY THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HEARING I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS FIRST WARDEN'S REMAINS CENTRAL TO THIS PROCESS AND UNDERMINE THE PURPOSE OF AIMS BY NOT REFERRING CASES AND KEEPING INCREASE WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. TO THE DEPARTMENT HAS LIKELY GROSSLY UNDERCOUNTED THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. BY ALLOWING WARDENS TO SIMPLY RE CATEGORIZE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT TO ROUTINE GRIEVANCES. AND FINALLY WARDENS RARELY FOUND MERIT IN THE ALLEGATIONS THEY RESOLVED ESSENTIALLY EXONERATING THEIR STAFF. MORE THAN 98% OF THE TIME. WE REVIEW THE ACTIVITIES OF AIMS FOR A FIVE MONTH PERIOD STARTING APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THROUGH AUGUST THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS WAS A PERIOD WHEN AIMS WAS FULLY FUNCTIONAL. DURING THIS FIVE MONTH PERIOD THE UNIT ACCEPTED FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT INCREASE OR ABOUT ONE FIFTH. OF WHAT. WHAT THE DEPARTMENT PROPOSED IT WOULD HANDLE. WE FOUND THAT WARDENS DETERMINED DURING THIS PERIOD THAT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES ALLEGED STAFF MISCONDUCT BUT WARDEN'S ONLY REFERRED FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE OF THESE TO AIMS. HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN ANALYSIS WHEN REQUESTING THE BUDGET AUGMENTATION FOR AIMS. THAT APART THE UNIT COULD HAVE HANDLED ALL OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. IF AIMS HAD FULFILLED ITS PROMISE IN THE NUMBER OF INCREASE THAT WOULD HANDLE THE ANNUALIZED COST PER ENQUIRY WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. BASED ON THE WORK THEY ACTUALLY DID THE ANNUALIZED COST PER ENQUIRY IS APPROXIMATELY NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE DOLLARS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE WAY THE INCREASES ARE CONDUCTED IS FLAWED. AIMS INVESTIGATORS DO NOT PERFORM A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION INSTEAD THEY WORK TO A NEBULOUS REASONABLE BELIEF STANDARD. THAT IS A REASONABLE BELIEF THAT MISCONDUCT MAY HAVE OCCURRED. AND THEN STOP THEIR INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES WRITE A REPORT AND SUBMIT THE REPORT TO THE WARDEN. IF THE WARDEN DISAGREES WITH THE CONCLUSION BY THE INVESTIGATOR THE ENQUIRIES OVER. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT INFORMED THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE WARDENS AND THE INSTITUTIONAL STAFF WERE REMOVED FROM THIS PROCESS. HOEVER UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATIONS DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT WARDENS AND INSTITUTIONAL STAFF REMAINED CENTRAL TO THIS PROCESS. CURRENTLY WARDENS OR THEIR CHIEFS REVIEW EVERY CLAIM THAT POTENTIALLY CONTAINS A GRIEVANCE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIM MEETS THE DEPARTMENT'S DEFINITION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND WHETHER IT WILL BE REFERRED OUTSIDE THE PRISON. NOTHING GETS REFERRED TO AIMS FOR INQUIRY WITHOUT THE WARDEN MAKING A REFERRAL. CONTRARY TO WHAT THE DEPARTMENT ASSERTED IN AN ASSEMBLY HEARING ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. WARDENS AND INSTITUTIONAL STAFF ARE MOST ASSUREDLY NOT OUT OF THIS PROCESS. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE CRITERIA THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPED FOR REFERRING GRIEVANCES TO AIMS FOR THE COMPLEX CALCULUS THAT WORKS TO EXCLUDE MOST BECAUSE MOST CLAIMS OF MISCONDUCT FROM BEING INVESTIGATED BY AIMS. EXCLUDE COMPLAINS THAT ALLEGED. SERRATED PERSON'S CLAIM OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE REPORTED BY STAFF BUT THAT DID NOT RESULT IN SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. SEXUAL MISCONDUCT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT AGAINST AN INCARCERATED PERSON. STAFF INVOLVEMENT IN DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS DURING THE INMATE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. AND INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPER STAFF DECISIONS DURING THE INMATE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. BUT INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF ISSUANCE OF FALSE RULES VIOLATIONS REPORTS. AND IT INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCESS. AS I NOTED EARLIER WARDENS IDENTIFIED TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES AS STAFF MISCONDUCT DURING OUR REVIEW PERIOD. HOWEVER THEY ONLY REFERRED 23% OF THOSE CASES TO AIMS. THEY HANDLED THE BALANCE OF THE 77% OF THE CASES INTERNALLY AT THE PRISONS. IN ADDITION WE HAVE UNCOVERED EVIDENCE THAT THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE GRIEVANCES IDENTIFIED BY THE WARDEN SAYS STAFF MISCONDUCT. IS GROSSLY UNDERCOUNTED. WE SUSPECT TAT INCARCERATED PERSONS FILED THOUSANDS MORE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT IN THE DEPARTMENT'S RECORDS SHOW. UNDER THE PROCESS DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT A GRIEVANCE IS FIRST REVIEWED BY A GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR WHO REFUSE TO SEE IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AFTER THAT REVIEW THE GRIEVANCE GOES FOR A FINAL REVIEW TO THE WARDEN TO CONCUR OR NOT WITH THE GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR THAT THE GRIEVANCE ALLEGES STAFF MISCONDUCT. WARDENS COUNTERMANDED THEIR GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR 65% OF THE TIME AND FOUND ONLY 35% OF THE GRIEVANCES FORWARDED TO THEM. ALLEGED STAFF MISCONDUCT. THE GRIEVANCES THAT WARDENS FOUND NOT TO BE STAFF MISCONDUCT CLAIMS WERE SIMPLY RE CATEGORIZED BY THE WARDEN AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. NEXT A FULL TWO YEARS AFTER SURE INCE'S WERE GIVEN NO AUDIT FUNCTION IS ANYWHERE IN SIGHT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO VISIBILITY ON WHETHER THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS IS WORKING. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS ITSELF TO PRODUCE REPORTS IDENTIFYING ALL OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT. OFFICERS WHO HAD THOSE ACCUSATIONS CORROBORATED OR WHO HAVE BEEN PUNISHED. FINALLY JUST AS AT SALINAS VALLEY TWO YEARS AGO THIS PROCESS EXONERATE STAFF AT AN ASTONISHING RATE. STAFF WERE EXONERATED NINETY EIGHT POINT LOOKED AT EITHER BY AIMS OR THOSE HANDLED IN HOUSE AT THE PRISONS. IN FACT UNDER THIS PROCESS THE RATE OF EXONERATIONS EXCEEDS WHAT WE FOUND AT SALINAS VALLEY TWO YEARS AGO. THE ISSUES ARE RAISED ABOVE ARE SYSTEMIC AND NOT ISOLATED TO A PARTICULAR PRISON. THE SHORTCOMINGS ARE ENSHRINED IN REGULATIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROMULGATED ALMOST A YEAR AGO. TO CORRECT THESE DEFICIENCIES I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT MUST COMPLETELY OVERHAUL ITS PROCESS. IN MY OPINION THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD TAKE A CLEAN SHEET APPROACH TO REVAMP THIS PROCESS. EMPHASIS NEEDS TO BE ILL BE ON ALLOWING AGGRIEVED PERSONS TO FORWARD THEIR COMPLAINTS DIRECTLY TO THE AIMS UNIT. AND THE AIMS UNIT SHOULD CONDUCT ALL ENQUIRIES NO MISCONDUCT INCREASE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO THE INSTITUTION. IN THE CASE OF USE OF FORCE MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS THERE SHOULD BE NO ARTIFICIAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MISCONDUCT THAT CAUSES PHYSICAL INJURY AND MISCONDUCT THAT BY A STROKE OF LUCK DIDN'T CAUSE PHYSICAL INJURY. THERE SHOULD BE NO ARTIFICIAL DIFFERENTIATION OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT GRIEVANCES. THE AMES UNIT NEEDS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IT OPENS AND IT NEEDS TO DO MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS. INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS PROMISED TWO YEARS AGO THE DEPARTMENT DESIGNED A SYSTEM WITH MANY OFF RAMPS THAT PREVENT A FAIR AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. DESPITE PROFESSING TO AGREE WITH OUR PRIOR RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENT IMPLEMENTED FEW IF ANY OF THEM. SINCE THE LATEST REPORT ISSUED I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE SECRETARY AND I HAD A VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THESE ISSUES LAST WEEK AND IN RESPONSE TO HER IMITATION I LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THESE AND OTHER ISSUES. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER WESLEY. I'M. ALL RIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SECRETARY I DON'T SEE ON THEM ON MY. OKAY SECRETARY ALISON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE KATHLEEN ALISON SECRETARY FOR CDC ARE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO SPEAK TO THESE VERY SERIOUS ISSUES I'M THANK YOU SEE OUR TAKES EVERY ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING ALL ALLEGATIONS ARE PROPERLY AND FAIRLY AND THOROUGHLY REVIEWED. WE WELCOME THE OFFICERS INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REVIEW WE'VE SPOKEN MANY TIMES SINCE REPORTS BASICALLY ABOUT HIS REPORT WE SPEAK OFTEN BUT WE SPOKEN SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HIS REPORT AND I CERTAINLY FIND HIS INSIGHT VERY VALUABLE- OKAY MINISTRATION AND THIS AGENCY HAS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO SEEKING OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT REVIEWS AS EVIDENCED BY ASKING THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL TO DO THAT I TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WRESTLERS VALERIE REPORTS- ON. REVAMPING OUR KILL SYSTEMS VERY NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND TRAVERSES REALIZE THAT THEY'RE. TOO DARK- I KNEW FROM MY MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WELL OVER THIRTY- IF THIS BUSINESS THAT. THERE OR THERE WAS A DISCONNECT BETWEEN OUR STAFF ALLEGATIONS- PROCESS AT FIRST SAYS ARE- INTERNAL AFFAIRS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WE HAVE NUMEROUS INMATES- STAFF COMPLAINTS. MOST AS AS THE OPTION INSPECTOR GENERAL STATED MOST ARE WITH NO FINDINGS HOWEVER. I HAVE WELL OVER TO AN AVERAGE OF TWO THOUSAND CASES ANNUALLY THAT ARE REFERRED FOR INVESTIGATION SO THERE'S A DISCONNECT SOMEWHERE. AND ALL OF THAT OVER TWO THOUSAND- REFERRALS TO OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS ANYWHERE FROM TWELVE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE RESULTS IN FORMAL- ADVERSE ACTION ON OUR STAFF. SO THERE WAS THERE WAS A DISCONNECTED THE DEPARTMENT WENT THROUGH I'M AND DEVELOPED A PROCESS THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. INITIALLY AND THEN FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY IN THE THROES OF COKE. THEREFORE IT. EIGHT AND I ALSO HAVE TO SAY THIS THAT I ALSO THINK THAT WE MADE IT TOO COMPLEX THE PROCESS WAS VERY VERY COMPLEX AS AS THE- IG REPORT HIGHLIGHTS- WITH A VARIETY OF CONCERNS. AND SO I'M HERE TO COMMIT TODAY TO MAKE YOU VERY SPECIFIC CHANGES. TO THIS PROCESS- AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD- TO HAVE IN A SEAMLESS PROCESS THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY I JUST. IT'S VERY TROUBLING- ANYWAY I APOLOGIZE SO- THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE MADE IT WE MADE IT TOO DIFFICULT FOR THE INSTITUTIONS AND WE WERE ALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING OUR- OUR- PROCESS EARLY EARLY ON. AND WE MERE SOMEWHAT WE CAME UP WITH SOME OF THE SAME SOLUTIONS OF THE- I CHEATED I WILL SAY THAT WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT WARDENS WERE NOT- PROPERLY REFERRED. WHAT W FOUND BECAUSE THAT IT WAS THE DEFINITION ON HOW THEY GOT THERE AND EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA WHICH WERE. SOME OF THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ENERGY ON GOING FORWARD. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME FAR EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES. SC'S CONCERT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING NEXT TIME AND MOTION STUDY- THE FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW LONG IT TAKES AND SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I WILL SAY THAT- AS I READ THESE REPORTS FIRST IS WHAT I USED TO READ AT INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL WHEN A LIEUTENANT PROVIDING MERE REPORT- ARE MUCH MORE DETAIL NOW. BEING IN A LOT OF INTERVIEWS BY LOTS OF. NOT ONLY THAT THE COMPLAINANT BUT ANY WITNESSES OF OTHER OFFENDERS OR STAFF IS- PART OF THE PROCESS. I WILL SAY IF YOU HAVE CAMERAS IT MAKES IT TOTALLY DIFFERENT REPORT. AMR'S REALLY HELP US TO IDENTIFY REAL TO FIND YOU KNOW IT WHETHER THE ALLEGATION IS TRUE OR NOT- SO I WILL SAY THAT. I'M SO SOME OF OUR VERY SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS FIRST TO THE INCONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THE SCREENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I HAVE DIRECTED MY TEAM FOR IMMEDIATE STRATEGY IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE. ACTUALIZE GRADING PROCESS FOR ALL ALLEGATIONS AGAINST STAFF. BY THE INCARCERATED POPULATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PREAH- WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE A VERY ROBUST PROCESS MONITORED BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL AS WELL AS AUDITED BY THE- GOVERNMENT. RE ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THAT IS IN ANY KIND OF PRE ALLOCATION YOU HAVE TO HAVE REAL TIME EVIDENCE YOU ONLY HAVE SO. MUCH TRYING TO GET SOMEBODY TO- FOR THE FULL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE- SO THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS AND THAT IS CURRENTLY NEARED BY THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL. BUT OUR SCREENING PROCESS WILL THIS WILL BE A SINGLE INDEPENDENT SOURCE TO ENSURE THE CURRENT REGULATIONS ARE CORRECTLY APPLIED IN DETERMINING WHETHER STAFF COMPLAINTS WOULD BE REFERRED. FOR PROCESSING AND REMOVED THE INSTITUTION FROM THE LOOK FROM THE I'M PROCESS FROM SCREENING FOR THE GO OUT OF THE SCREEN BY- THE HEADQUARTERS THEY'LL MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHO BEST TO HANDLE THAT COMPLAINT. THIS WOULD INCLUDE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY FORCE. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL GRIEVANCES ALREADY SKEWS ME LOCAL GRIEVANCE CORNERS TO SIMPLY FOR ANY GRIEVANCE RECEIVED. THAT IS A STAFF COMPLAINED TO THE STATE WIDE CENTRAL ASIA FOR PROCESSING. OUR CURRENT PRACTICES TO FOLLOW. I APOLOGIZE OUR CURRENT PRACTICE AT THIS POINT HAS BEEN THAT THE LOCAL INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONS TO DETERMINE. IF A STAFF COMPLAINT WAS FOLLOWED SKEWS ME I APOLOGIZE IF IT'S STAFF COMPLAINT WAS FOUND TO BE TRUE AND HAS LUCK WITH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ADVERSE ACTION WOULD RESULT. IN THOSE GO FORWARD AGAIN TO COMPLEX- GOOD THIS COMMITMENT OVER CENTRALIZED SCREENING UNITS A LOCAL INSTITUTION WILL NO LONGER APPLY THIS COMPLEX CRITERIA ENSURING ALL STAFF COMPLAINTS GO TO INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE AREA. APPLY THIS POLICY STANDARD SECONDLY. WE CURRENTLY PROCESS ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY FORCE WITH SERVICE BODILY INJURY AS IN AMES ENQUIRING. RECOGNIZING THAT SERVICE BODILY INJURY DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALL OTHER INJURIES OUTSIDE OF THE DEFINITION OF SERVICE VOLLEY INJURY AS A RESULT. ARE THE FIRST STEP. I HAVE DIRECTED MY TEAM TO INSTITUTE AN EXPANSION OF THIS PROCESS WHERE ALL ALLEGATIONS OF UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE FORCE WITH ANY INJURY. ARE REFERRED TO THE AIM SHUNET INCLUDING THOSE THAT DO NOT MEET SB I. THIRD I HAVE DIRECTED MY STAFF TO. IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT A PROCESS WORKS PAINS INQUIRE RES WILL PROVIDE A CLEAR. CONCLUSION THAT WILL. INDICATE TWO POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ONE A THOROUGH AND COMPLETE INQUIRY HAS BEEN COMPLETED TO INCLUDE ALL FAX. THEY BELIEVE AVAILABLE TO. REASONABLE BELIEF THAT MISCONDUCT HAS OCCURRED AND MAY LEAD FOR ADVERSE ACTION WHEN REASONABLE LEAVE HAS REACHED IMMEDIATE FIRST STEP TO CHANGE OUR PROCESS A REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION WILL BE INITIATED BY THE AIMS UNITS. REFER TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY- OUR SIGNATURE. THIS WILL ALLOW MORE SWIFTLY PROCESS WERE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT SHOULD A HIRING HISTORIAL LOCAL LEVEL DISAGREED WITH THE RECOMMENDATION FOR INVESTIGATION THEY ARE TO MEET LEE REFERRED THAT TO THE AIMS TO YOU FOR RESOLUTION ALLOWING FOR MONITORING OVERSIGHT AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. IF THERE IS CONTINUED DISAGREEMENT THEN THEY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR- WOULD ALSO GET INVOLVED AND TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE. IN ADDITION TO THE FIRST REACTIONS I PENSION THE- THIS THIS AFTERNOON WE ALSO AGREED THAT THE DEFINITION- NEEDS TO BE ABOUT ARE YOU WAITED. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING IT RIGHT THIS TIME THAT WE SLOW DOWN ENOUGH TO GET IT RIGHT THAT WE LOOK AT NATIONAL BEST PRACTICES- WE LOOK AT THEIR JURISDICTIONS EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE THE BEST ALLEGATION QUERY PROCESS AVAILABLE- I'M SO I'D ASK MY STAFF TO START DOING SOME SURVEYS. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT- WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DEFINITION. WE ARE WE ARE ALSO- LOOKING AT THAT TIME LINE AS IT RELATES TO ALLEGATIONS THAT ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT OTHER TIME. THAT ARE IMPACTED SO DEFINITELY OPEN TO SOME ADDITIONAL CHANGES THERE. FURTHERMORE THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THAT MULTIPLE ISOLATED DATA SYSTEMS ARE NOT PERFORMING OPTIMALLY. BAKER RECORDING OF END TO END PROCESS IS DIFFICULT. UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE FOCUS OF RESOURCES RESPONDED OVERHEAD NINETEEN PANDEMIC DID YOU SEE OUR WAS UNABLE TO INVEST INTERNAL. INTERNAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THAT. ISSUE DURING DURING THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF BANKING. AS A SITUATION REGARDING THAT PAT AND EMMITT CONTINUES TO IMPROVE IN THE COMING WEEKS SHIFT OF OUR ATTENTIONAL RESOURCES TO FIND OUT- WORKABLE IT SOLUTION. WILL BE UNDER WAY. I AM COMMITTED. FOR THESE EITHER TO READ THE REVIEWS AND THOROUGHLY. FINALLY WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IN OUR ADDITIONAL CAMERA- SYSTEMS THAT ARE G. LANCASTER'S STATE PRISON FACILITIES B. AND D. WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THAT ARMSTRONG COURT COMPLIANCE PROPOSAL. I FIRMLY BELIEVE CAMERAS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFIT THE REDUCTION OF STAFF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS AT OUR INSTITUTIONS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE CAMERAS WE HAVE CAMERAS AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON- CCW AFTER A SURGE OF CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY IN CHOWCHILLA. WE HAVE A SPECIFIC MENTAL HEALTH- HOUSING UNITS AT CSP SACRAMENTO- ABOUT A STATE PRISON HAS A FEW CAMERAS OF COURSE NOW R. J. D. HAS CAMERAS I WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN APRIL. OF THIS YEAR AND THE CORE AND WE ACTIVATED BODY CAMERAS IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR I DO BELIEVE AND THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SHOW A REDUCTION OF STAFF COMPLAINTS- SO CERTAINLY ASK FOR YOUR. SUPPORT WHERE- I WONDER REITERATE TO THE SUB COMMITTEE MY RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS MUCH TO IMPROVE IN THE CURRENT PROCESSES LAID OUT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. MY COMMITMENT TO CREATE A SWIFT CHANGE TO APPROVE THE PROCESS BY OPENNESS TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WHILE DOING SO. I WOULD NOW LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO FISCAL SERVICES DEPUTY DIRECTOR ERICA SWANSON DIRECTOR AMY MILLER AND ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR MARION SPARE MENTORED BY THE BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR ARMSTRONG COURT COMPLIANCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR. ACTUALLY I THINK WE CAN GET TO ARMSTRONG IN THE NEXT ISSUE SO WE CAN DO FOR OUR COMMENTS FOR NOW ON THAT ISSUE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SWANSON THANK YOU SECRETARY ALISON WILL WILL HOLD OFF ON ARMSTRONG. FIRST THE ADDRESS THIS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE TO THE NEXT. THE NEXT ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY ALLISON- I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THE CONVERSATION ABOUT. BEING HAD BETWEEN YOURSELF AND THE- INSPECTOR GENERAL- AS AS A WE TRY TO MOVE FORWARD AND MAKE A LOT MORE PROGRESS I WANT TO ASK THE- THE INSPECTOR GENERAL A FEW QUESTIONS. MISTER WESLEY YES MA'AM- EIGHT YOU MADE REFERENCE TO YOU YOU FELT THAT THESE ISSUES AND PROBLEMS- WERE- VERSUS A SPECIFIC PROBLEMS THAT SPECIFIC OF FACILITIES- COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU SAY THAT. IN OUR REVIEW OF THE- THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR LATEST LATEST REPORT- WE LOOKED AT WE LOOK ACROSS THE- DEPARTMENTS- SPECTRUM OF PRISONS AND WE FOUND THE SAME ISSUES. OVER AND OVER AGAIN- THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT WE FOUND WAS THAT- WARDENS RECOUNTED RAISED STAFF MISCONDUCT COMPLAINTS AND APPEARED NOT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CRITERIA WAS FOR- FOR REFERRAL TO AIMS AND EVEN WHEN. THEY CLEARLY MET THE REFERRAL CRITERIA- MOST OF THEM 77% AND THAT'S A NUMBER FROM ACROSS THE SPECTRUM WERE KEPT IN THE PRISON AND DONE LOCALLY- ACCORDING TO THE REGULATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT THOUGH SHOULD HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO AIMS- SO IT WAS IT THIS WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST ISOLATED TO ONE PRISON- WE SAW THE SAME ISSUES- AT PRETTY MUCH EVERY PRISON- IN THE STATE. FROM ARE THERE ANY RESOURCES THAT YOUR OFFICE MAY NEED TO HELP OUR CONTINUE TO OUR REPORT ON THIS PROCESS. YES MA'AM THE- OUR OFFICE IS. SERIOUSLY UNDER RESOURCE TO REVIEW THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND PROVIDE THE MONITORING- THAT WE THINK IS APPROPRIATE- WE HAVE FIVE PEOPLE STATE WIDE ONE OF THOSE AS A SUPERVISOR SO WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE OUT IN THE FIELD WHO DO THIS KIND OF MONITORING- AND SO WE CAN DO NOTHING MORE THAN- ANECDOTAL MONITORING OF THE- OF THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE INQUIRY'S- WE RECOMMEND THAT- AS IN OUR OTHER MONITORING ACTIVITIES THAT WE MONITOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- 25% OR MORE OF. THE ENCOURAGED TO GO FORWARD WE THINK THAT GIVES A GOOD STATISTICAL MODEL TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS FROM- WHAT WE ARE- WHAT OUR FIRST REPORT HAS FOCUSED ON IS THE IS THE BONES OF THE PROCESS HOW IT'S SET UP AND HOW THAT'S WORKING WE HAVE NOT FOCUSED ON THE QUALITY OF THE INTERVIEWS- SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO DO THAT- I'M I- HAVE- WE WORKED UP SOME. SOME NUMBERS- AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU- BUT BUT BASED ON THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE- THERE IS THERE SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH MONITORS TO- ACTUALLY PROVIDE GOOD INFORMATION ON HOW THE PROCESS IS WORKING- IN A QUALITATIVE SENSE OF ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY- IN THAT IS THE PRE A PIECE I'D LIKE TO- SORT AMPLIFY ON WHAT THE SECRETARY NOTED- SHE NOTED THAT WE MONITOR PRIA THAT'S NOT PRECISELY TRUE- OUR- OUR STATUTE. REQUIRES A HER NAME'S US AS THE PRE OP OMBUDSMAN- AND SO THE DIFFERENCE IN THAT IS THAT WOULD YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS THE VICTIM OF A PRIA. COMPLAINS ABOUT- THE INVESTIGATION OR HOW THAT HOW THAT. ALLEGATION WAS HANDLED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THEN WE LOOK AT IT BUT WE DON'T HAVE A MONITORING PROCESS THAT INDEPENDENTLY LOOKS AT HOW THE DEPARTMENT DOES ITS PRE A PROCESS- OURS IS VERY MUCH. DRIVEN BY IF SOMEBODY COMPLAINS- WHO HAS BEEN PART OF THE- WHO IS MADE OF A PRE A COMPLAINT- SO AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY WHAT OUR PRIA OF MONITORING IS THANK YOU AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT YOUR- COMMENDATIONS. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF WOULD THERE BE A NEED TO CHANGE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. BOB FOR THIS PROCESS- THE RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AS OUTLINED IN THE STATUTE CHANGE FROM TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY. WE WERE- OUR STATUTE PROVIDES THAT WE WOULD MONITOR THIS PROCESS AND- THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY KEEPING US FROM DOING A ROBUST MONITORING IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE HAVE TO DO IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FROM AND THE MY QUESTIONS WERE C. D. C. R- OF WHETHER IT'S SECRETARY ALISON OR ANYONE ELSE- IT YOUR RESPONSE TO THE REPORT IS ARE YOU PREPARING A RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OR- TO REPORT BY THE O. I. G. WE PREPARE A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WE DID DRAFT INITIAL LETTER ACKNOWLEDGING THE REPORT BUT WE PREPARE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN. ON ANY OF THE OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS AND WE PROVIDE REGULAR FOLLOW UP. BUT THEY WILL BE PART OF OUR PROCESS- AS WE DEVELOP SOME OF OUR SUBSEQUENT CHANGES THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY BE HAPPY TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU AS WELL AS MR- WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE- LOSING TO MAKE CHANGES. ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES THROUGH AIMS- IS THAT WHERE YOU PROPOSED TO DO IT OR- YEAH SO CHANGES THE FIRST THE FIRSTCHANGE THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE MADE IS IN THE SCREENING PROCESS WE MADE THAT VERY VERY TO COMPLEX I'M JUST SAYING IT'S SO COMPLEX I DON'T. YOU'RE READING IT- SO WERE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CENTRAL A SCREENING PROCESS. OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTIONS M. M. AND CURRENTLY THAT WILL BE IN OUR AIMS UNITS. SPECIALIZED TRAINED STAFF TO SCREEN THOSE MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE. ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL REFERRED TO WAS THAT THERE WAS A- THE SYSTEM SUPPOSED TO EXCLUDE THE INSTITUTION. ON FROM THE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THE UNIT FROM THE- ACCEPTANCE OR NON ACCEPTANCE OF THE COMPLAINTS- AND THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE HERE SEEMS TO BE THAT THE WARDENS ARE FULLY INVOLVED ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN DECIDING WHICH CASES ARE AIRED GRIEVANCES OR IF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS OF SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE IS AS HE DESCRIBED IT. THE INSTITUTION OF THE WARDENS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A PART OF THIS. AND YET THEY ARE. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE PRIOR- AGENCY LEADS AS FAR AS WHAT THEIR AGREEMENTS FOR I CAN I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO FROM HERE- AND HONESTLY THIS. THAT THE DEFINITION WILL LIKELY TO LEAD TO ADVERSE ACTION. IS RELATIVELY COMPLEX WITH THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I WILL SAY THAT THE WARDENS WERE NOT INTENTIONALLY NOT SENDING THINGS OFF TO AIMS IT JUST SOMETIMES DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BASED ON ALL THE VARIOUS DEFINITIONS AND EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA THAT'S WHAT MADE IT MADE IT SO DIFFICULT. SO I DO THINK THAT RESOLVING THAT PROBLEM BY HAVING A CENTRALIZED PROCESS OUTSIDE OF THE INSTITUTIONS WILL BE HELPFUL BUT AS I SAID THERE WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT WARNS WERE INTENSELY NOT SENDING ANYTHING OFF TO AIMS I MEAN AND I CAN AND I WANT TO JUST REITERATE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE WELL OVER TWO THOUSAND INVESTIGATIONS FORMAL INVESTIGATIONS AT WHARTON CENTER EVERY SINGLE. YEAR. OF THE OF THE TWO THOUSAND- ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE SENT TO THE WARDEN'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED WENT TO AMES. WHAT I CAN HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE. IT'S VERY SIX CLOSURE CRITERIA THAT WE HAD. THAT DAY THEY GO ONCE INTO DIFFERENT BUCKETS AND ALL ALL USE- WHETHER IT'S- A RULES VIOLATION REPORTS THAT MIGHT HAVE HAD- A DUE PROCESS VIOLATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW LIEUTENANT JONES WAS DISRESPECTFUL. IT'S A PROCESS ALLEGATION VERSE SAYS- YOU KNOW WHAT MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS- SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY THINGS GOT SCREENED OUT BASED ON THE SCREEN OUT CRITERIA AS WELL AS THE DEFINITION THAT MADE IT VERY IT MADE IT TOO COMPLEX FOR THE INSTITUTIONS. TO START WITH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE FOR THE ISSUE AND I DO FEEL LIKE THIS PROCESS OTHER MAYBE SOME THAT ARE GOING TO BE RETURNED TO THE INSTITUTIONS FOR ANALYSIS OF THE RULES VIOLATION REPORT FOR- DUE PROCESS VIOLATION IN THE JUST. MAKE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS- AND OF COURSE AS WE JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW PRIA AND OTHERS YOU KNOW- THEY'RE DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A VERY ROBUST- PROCESS AS RELATES TO OUR USE OF FORCE- AND- I. G. BEARS ARE USED TO FORCE PROCESSES WELL. AND SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE AGREED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE OR UNNECESSARY FORCE WILL GO AHEAD AND TO BE PROCESSED BY AIMS. THE INSTITUTION WILL HOLD THEIR USE OF FORCE COMMITTEES UNTIL THEY GET THAT BACK- BUT THE OFFICE INSPECTOR GENERAL IS SITTING OUT ON THOSE COMMITTEES. SO I REALIZE THE NUMBERS SEEM. AND I WANT TO MAKE TWO FOUR FOUR ONE OTHER POINT THE NUMBERS MISTER WESLEY IS REFERRING TO- AS FAR AS THE TWO THOUSAND DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED ARE NOT THE SAME TWO THOUSAND THAT I'M REFERRING TO THAT WERE FORMERLY BEST ENGAGED OR MAKE SURE THAT. HIS ACTION BECAUSE WE HOW OF- AT ANY TIME STAFF CAN HAVE A VARIETY OF MISCONDUCT WHETHER IT'S INMATE RELATED OR OFF DUTY MISCONDUCT. THAT IS REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF THE TROUBLE. THOSE CASES ARE INVESTIGATED THE OFFICER THE SPECTER GENERAL SENSE- AT THE CENTRAL INTAKE PROCESS ON DAY ONE. WHEN THAT CASE IS BEING EVALUATED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHETHER IT'S GOING TO GO FOR FORMAL INVESTIGATION OVER THIS COULD BE SENT BACK TO THE INSTITUTE. FOR A DIRECT. ACTION MEANING THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION AND I'LL USE AN EXAMPLE IF THE- REX LAW OFFICER IS ARRESTED FOR- DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE. WE HAVE A POLICE REPORT WE HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO DO AN INVESTIGATION. BUT WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS ACTION. SO IS THOSE KIND OF NEW WANTS SAYS- BUT IF AN INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED. WHEN IT GOES FOR FULL INVESTIGATION IN THAT PROCESS- I. G. GETS TO PICK WHICH CASES THEY WANT TO DO DEPEND UPON THE SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGATIONS. AND PROCEED THROUGH THE THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS- FROM THE INVESTIGATION. TO THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE PENALTY AT THE LOCAL INSTITUTION AS WELL AS FOLLOWS IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD PROCESS. IF YOU ASK MEMBER FEELS THAT. WE'RE TALKING TO DIFFERENT THINGS- AND SO THAT WAS CLEAR I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND THEN I'LL OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES- IN THE NEW PROCESS THAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING AND RECOMMENDING. ARE THE WARD IS. GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT PROCESS- DISCRETE FOR. VERY WILL NOT BE PART OF THAT NO WE TAKE THOSE. THE GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR VANSITTART WILL COLLECT THEIR GRIEVANCES FROM THEIR INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES INDIVIDUAL YARDS AT THE INSTITUTION. AND THEY WILL PACKAGE THEM UP AND SEND THEM TO A FIRST BILL WORKING OUT WITH US AND BE LIKE TRONIC AND- OR WHETHER IT'S GONNA BE A- MAIL SENT I. STAFFER STILL LOOKING AT THAT PIECE OF IT BUT THOSE WILLING WILL NOT GO THROUGH A LOCALIZED REMAIN- IT WILL JUST BE. I SHOULDN'T SAY IT WILL GO THROUGH ALL THAT ADVERSITY GREENS CARD IT'LL EVALUATE MAKE SURE. O. OKAY IT'S A STAFF COMPLAIN VERSES I THINK IT A LUNCH YES. I'M A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT KIND OF PLAY OR MY LUNCH WAS. HOLDER WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE- YOU STILL HAVE GRIEVANCES THAT ARE NOT STAFF COMPLAIN SO HE'LL MAKE THAT INITIAL DETERMINATION AND THEN SPEND THAT. THOSE WILL BE. OUT FOR SCREENING AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S PROCESS- WHERE WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO IS THERE ENOUGH FOR AN INVESTIGATION CURRENTLY DO WE NEED AIMS TO DO AN EVALUATION PROVIDE THAT THE INSTITUTIONS WITH MORE INFORMATION SO I CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION. ON- WHAT'S THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE COORDINATOR THE GRIEVANCE COORDINATOR THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT'S ONE AT EACH FACILITY. OR IS THAT WHAT IT IS WE HAVE ONE EACH INSTITUTION YES MA'AM OKAY IS THAT CORRECT OKAY. SENATORS OF CENTER NEWMAN- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SURGERY ALSO THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY- I WANTED TO AYE I'M STRUCK BY YOUR REFERENCE TO THE FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER PER OR PER SHARE OF THE CASES THAT WERE REFERRED FOR FORMAL INVESTIGATION YOU MENTION FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES OF TWO THOUSAND. WHICH I THINK BASED ON THE REST OF. THE TESTIMONY TODAY IS PROBABLY A MUCH SMALLER NUMBERS THAN IT SHOULD BE. YES MY QUESTION FOR YOU AT LEAST TO START IS IF YOU WERE TO MOVE. THE SCREENING TO A CENTRALIZED PROCESS THAT AS YOU MENTIONED. ONE OF THE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT AND DO YOU HAVE OR THEIR CURRENT STAFF TO DO THAT IF NOT. IS THERE A COST THAT YOU COULD ACCESS TO THAT AND IS IT ALREADY BUDGETED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND- WE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME INTERNAL RESOURCES OR REDIRECT THEM. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS INITIALLY WE ALSO HAVE THE R. J. D. REQUEST WHICH WAS ALREADY LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE SAME PROCESSES- SO IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCE NEEDS. WE WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PROCESS. TO OBTAIN. I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE RIGHT THERE I MEAN THAT SEEMS THAT'S QUICK MATTERS THAT'S WELL OVER A HUNDRED- LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN ADVERSE ACTION PER MONTH- SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT. A SUBSTANTIAL STAFF TIME TO DO THAT- AND I'M ASSUMING YOU DON'T HAVE THAT. ALREADY ON HAND. YOU KNOW WE DO NOT SIR. RIGHT BUT I'M NOT PREPARED TO BE ABLE TO. GIVE A PRECISE NUMBER WE DO HAVE THE TIME AND MOTION STUDY GOING ON RIGHT NOW SHE TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S OTHER EFFICIENCIES WEEKEND- WHAT'S ONE THING ABOUT KOBE- WE'VE GOT TO PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY IS. INSTRUMENTAL IN ASSISTING US WITH VARIOUS- PROCESSES FOR EXAMPLE INTERVIEW- THE SENATE STAFF HAVING TO DRIVE THREE FOUR HOURS TO AN INSTITUTION SOME OF OUR VERY REMOTE LOCATIONS. HELLO CHUCK A WALA CAL PANTRY HANNAH KELLY CAN BAY. WE CAN ACTUALLY NOW GET ON THE SUIT. AND SO THAT REALLY HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL. THE CARD FINE WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AS WELL AS EXPANDING- THAT THE VOLUME OF WORKS MARK. IT SEEMS THAT WE'VE MET ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO WILL WHO LIKES JIM TIME TO MOLD A- PRECIADO AND MY OTHER QUESTION IS. HOW WE FOR ABOUT. I MADE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS NUMBER IS CLEARLY LOW- GIVEN SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES WE TALK ABOUT. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THAT THAT THAT VERY HIGH RATIO. OF CASES THAT DO RESULT IN ADVERSE ACTION AGAINST STAFF. OKAY SO I AND AGAIN I THINK WE'RE WE'RE CONFLATING ISSUES SO LET'S FIND. NO NO IT'S OKAY AIMS PROCESS IS AN INITIAL ALLEGATIONS AND- HE TOOK MY SHOES OFF SIR CONFISCATED MY SHOES WELL IS THAT STAFF MISCONDUCT OR IS. OR IS IT THE INMATE HAD CONTRABAND OR SOMETHING I MEAN THIS FRIDAY OF I'M JUST STARTING OUT WITH A DECENT EXAMPLE FOR YOU THERE'S SO MANY- VERSES REALLY SERIOUS- I MEAN ALL OR ALL OR SERIOUS TO ME WE HAVE TO TREAT EVERYBODY WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT I WANT THIS DEPARTMENT TO GET. NOTHING BACK I FEEL VERY VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT TOO MUCH FOR IT IS HOW I HAVE- CONDUCTED MYSELF MY ENTIRE CAREER. BUT THE NUMBERS THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS FORMAL ADVERSE ACTION THOSE ARE FULL INVESTIGATIONS OR DIRECT ACTIONS BASED ON. YOU KNOW WE HOW HARD EVIDENCE- VERSUS AN ALLEGATION OF OFFICER JONES. YOU KNOW I TALKED TO ME IN A DISPARAGING WAY IN THE HOUSING UNITS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE BIG WE HAVE TO DO INTERVIEWS. WE HAVE TO TRY AND FIND WITNESSES IS THAT WITNESS THAT MISCONDUCT VERSES. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING THAT HAS YOU KNOW HARD HARD EVIDENCE. SO HOW AM I MOVE MY IT BUT HOW HOW WAS IT SORT OF DAY LOGGED AND TRACKED. THAT SHOW THAT I PRESUME WE OVER TIME YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW A BASS LINE AND YOU COULD LOOK AT PROCESSOR BEHAVIOR IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME. YES SO- OUR FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROCESS DOES HAVE A CENTRAL DATABASE. AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED FOR A LONG TIME OUR TEAMS PROCESS JUST THE ALLEGATION CHOIR REYES DID NOT HOW. LONG SHOULD ALL DATABASE- AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THAT DEVELOPED- BUT THE MORE FORMAL ACTIONS ALREADY ALREADY HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF ADVERSE ACTION I MEAN YOU CAN. HAVE AS YOU KNOW FROM A LETTER OF FORMAL REPRIMAND ALL THE WAY TO DISMISSAL PERCENTAGE OF TIME. I MEAN I'M SORRY PERCENTAGE OF LOST WAGES YOU LIKE 5% FOR TWELVE MONTHS OR SUSPENSION DEPEND UPON THE LEVEL OF MISCONDUCT SO IT YOU KNOW DEFINITELY DEFINITELY VERY I WILL SAY I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT OUR SYSTEM IS VERY ROCKBASS. OFFSET INSPECTOR GENERAL MIRS THAT PROCESS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING- IF THEY DISAGREE WITH THE LOCAL HIRING AUTHORITY THEY CAN BRING IT UP FOR EXECUTIVE REVIEW IF IT GOES THROUGH THE ORCHARDS DIRECT- THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SECRETARY- IF NEED BE- IF THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AND- THE HIRING AUTHORITY AND OFTEN SPECTACLE WOULD BRING IT ALL THE WAY UP. THAT EFFECT I THINK I DID ONE EXECUTIVE RADIO MY ENTIRE TIMES UNDERSECRETARY SO- YOU KNOW IT'S A PROCESS THAT I THINK WORKS. ARE AIMS PROCESSED MEAT HAS A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT WE DID COME A LONG WAY WE HAVE. A LONG WAY TO GO TO GET IT RIGHT. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S AND I'D LIKE TO PER MAYBE YOU KNOW- I DON TO YOU TO HIGHLIGHTS WHAT I CHANGE ARE IN SOME. AND THEIR KIND OF X. BLAME THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE L. AND SIMPLE A RELATIVELY SIMPLE ALLEGATION VERSUS SOMETHING THAT IS MORE FORMAL JOINT I CAN. THINK WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND I WOULD I WILL ALSO ASK IF POSSIBLE IF YOU COULD INCLUDE SOME OF THE THINKING YOU MENTION ABOUT HOW TO CAPTURE DATA- AND TO MR WESLEY'S POINT HOW TO USE THAT DATA- FOR QUALITATIVE PURPOSES OVER TIME. SHOULD THANK YOU MEASURE THANK YOU- I WAS GOING TO REFER TO. THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. COULD YOU PLEASE MISTER WESLEY- RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUE I THINK ESPECIALLY WITH THE NUMBERS. HERE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE CASES. YEAH I WANTED TO- KIND OF CLARIFY- THE NUMBERS- S. SECRETARIAL SINCE CORRECT THERE'S BEEN A CONFLATION OF NUMBER. OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND- INVESTIGATIONS THAT SHE REFERENCES. ARE ARE ALLEGATIONS THAT CAME UP THROUGH THE STAFF PROCESS SO SUPERVISORS AND STAFF AT THE INSTITUTIONS- FILED WITH THE WARDENS- COMPLAINTS OF MISCONDUCT AND THOSE WENT TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS. TO TO OPEN AS IT AS MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATION SO THOSE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT CAME UP THROUGH A SEPARATE CHANNEL THEN THE ALLEGATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDER AIMS. UNDER AIMS THE ALLEGATIONS COME UP THROUGH THE END MAKE COMPLAINTS. THROUGH COMPLAINTS MADE BY INCARCERATED PERSONS SO- THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THAT I TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THOSE CAME FROM- INCARCERATED PERSONS AND THERE WAS A THERE WAS A VERY LOW REFERRAL RATE OF THOSE CASES. SO THERE APPEARS TO BE A DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN WHETHER IT GETS REFERRED BY STAFF OR WHETHER IT GETS REFERRED BY- AN INCARCERATED PERSON SO I THINK THAT WAS THE DISCONNECT- THE- THE ACTUAL- FINDINGS UNDER THE- OF THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS PROCESS THE GETS ELEVATED THROUGH STAFF. IS ABOUT 54% OF THOSE CASES- MISCONDUCT- THE ALLEGATIONS ARE SUSTAINED- THEY DON'T ALL RESULT IN ADVERSE ACTION THEY RESULT IN A VARIETY FROM TRAINING TO- TO TERMINATION. BUT IT'S. PLAY PROCESS. THERE ACTUALLY WAS NO OF SUSTAINED FINDINGS OF THE- THE WARDENS OUT OF THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE COMPLAINTS THAT CAME UP THROUGH THE INCARCERATED PROCESS. REFERRED ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE OF THOSE AND OF THOSE NONE RESULTED IN- IN ANY DISCIPLINE OR OR- FORMAL ACTION- SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF CLARIFY- THE DIFFERENCE IN AND WHAT WE WERE TALKING. I GUESS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT'S PROBABLY STILL ALSO TRUE THAT A FAIRLY LARGE SHARE OF INMATE COMPLAINTS LEAD OR ARE CREDIBLE- AND DESERVING OF EXAMINATION LEAD TOWARD SOME SORT OF ADVERSE ACTION. SHOW IT AGAIN THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT OVER TIME TO SEE IF. YOU CAN USE THAT DATA TO ASSESS WHETHER THINGS ARE IMPROVING. I THINK IT'S A GREAT. YES WE CERTAINLY. AGREE THAT THE DATA SYSTEMS HAVE TO BE- HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO RECORD WHAT IS HISTORICALLY HAPPENING BECAUSE- QUITE FRANKLY- UNDER THE STATE SYSTEM THE ADVERSE ACTION IS REALLY. THE WHOLE PROCESS IS- WITH THEM WHICH I THOUGHT IN MIND THATYOU'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE EMPLOYEES DISTRICT ARE- BEHAVIOR AND SO- IF SOMEBODY IS DISRESPECTFUL TO AN INMATE- THE FIRST TIME THAT MAY RESULT IN NOTHING MORE THAN COUNSELING BUT IF IT HAPPENS THE FIFTH TIME THAT MAY RESULT IN- IN DISCIPLINARY ACTION AND- THERE'S NO STE DATA SYSTEM. THAT CAN CAPTURE THAT RIGHT NOW. RIGHT INTO BY INFERENCE SHOULD SOMEBODY IS NOT IF THE COMPLAINT IS AND DOESN'T WORK- AND THAT SECOND THIRD FOURTH FIFTH INCIDENT- IS NOT CAPTURED YOU'LL GET NO IMPROVEMENT RIGHT IN THE SUIT. THAT'S CORRECT YEAH THE PROJECT THAT THEY THANK YOU AFTER. SENATE QUARTERS IN. THE TICKET MANAGER- MISTER WESLEY APPRECIATE- ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS ON THIS. BEEN LISTENING TO YOUR PRESENTATION INITIAL PRESENTATION. I ACTUALLY FELT THAT IT WAS RATHER TROUBLING ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND THEN I WAS ALMOST TAKEN ABACK WITH YOUR YOUR LAST SENTENCE OR TWO WHICH WAS- I WANT TO PARAPHRASE IT'LL BE FACETIOUS BUT- WE'RE GONNA GET TOGETHER- YOU IN THE SECRETARY AN- INTERNAL WORKINGS OUT- EARLIER THE SECRETARY OFFERED THAT TO GIVE US A DOCUMENT THAT WOULD EXPLAIN- SOME OF THE PROCESS QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP BY THE COMMITTEE PRIOR TO MY SPEAKING. MISTER WESLEY AS A RESULT OF THESE MEETINGS THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A THE SECRETARY WOULD BE WILLING TO PROVIDE US WITH. A CHART. ON THAT INDICATES. WHERE YOU TO HAVE COME TO AGREEMENT. A WERE YOU HAVEN'T COME TO AGREEMENT. IN AND WHERE YOU THINK ADDITIONAL ACTION IS pOF THE DATE AS OF LAST WEEK WE REALLY HAD NO DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON- ON OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AND- THE DEPARTMENT- THANKS FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN. THAT WAS REALLY THE END OF IT AND I WAS- PROBABLY MORE THAN A YEAR AGO I WAS A PRESENT FOR A BRIEFING THE DEPARTMENT GAVE. UP ON THEIR REGULATIONS PROCESS WE RAISED SOME CNCERNS ABOUT THAT AND ABOUT THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE PROMULGATED. AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT WENT FORWARD WITH- WITH- APPROVING THOSE RECORD RECOMMENDATION OR THOSE REGULATIONS RATHER AT THAT- SO ALTHOUGH. UNDER OUR PROCESS WE CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WE SIMPLY- AS AS AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY THEN REPORT WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT- TOOK OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE NOT AND I'M AND PART OF THIS REPORT IS TO TELL YOU THAT FOR THE MOST PART THEY DID NOT. EIGHT EIGHT I GET THAT AND I JUST I'M NOT USED TO HAVING. IN A IN A REVIEW OR AUDIT LIKE FUNCTION THE SOMEBODY. TWENTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNMENT. IS UNDER LIKE THIS WITHOUT A DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS COMING INTO THIS STAGE WHERE THERE'S AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD AND WHEN WHERE THERE'S NOT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING IN THE PAST. THERE'S BEEN SOME AGREEMENT- IT IN SUCH A PROCESS ISSUE AND THERE'S TIME TO DO THAT OR NOT CONCLUDED ANYTHING HERE TODAY AND I JUST FEEL LIKE A DOCUMENT LIKE THAT THAT COMES TO US WOULD BE INVITING- IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S- NO COMMITMENT GOING FORWARD TO RESOLVE. THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES HERE. I'M ONLY GOING TO REALLY ASK BUT YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE ONE MORE FROM THE LINE OF QUESTIONING THIS VERY SPECIFIC TO THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED US. BUT HONESTLY I THINK BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD TODAY I COULD PROBABLY ASK A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE QUESTIONS AND NOT BE DONE BECAUSE- OF THAT SO. DISJOINTED THIS FEELS RIGHT NOW COLLECTIVELY AFFECT. THE MENIAL IG'S REPORT I MEAN THE RESPONSE TO THE REPORT IN BASICALLY- BASICALLY THE SEER TEN GENTLE BUT SERIOUS ISSUES THAT- THE BASICALLY ARISE IN MY MIND AS I AS I READ AND LISTEN TO REPORT- THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES IN TERMS OF- LITIGATION. IN PORTABILITY THE STATE'S TREASURY LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHERE I'M THINKING THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE YOU INDICATED MISTER WESLEY THE- EXCLUSIONS TO THE AIMS PROCESS INCLUDE- SEVERAL FRAMES A THROUGH F. BUT OFFICE STAFF MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCESS. AND I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE THAT- THERE'S BEEN A SIGNIFICANT- TREND ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF A PLAINTIFF LITIGATION ASSERTING. A REFORM IS NECESSARY BUT WITH THE ADA AND IN JAILS AND PRISONS. BUT DOWN BELOW. AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THAT WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE AIMS PROCESS DOWN BELOW- YOU INDICATE- IN AMMAN PAGE SIX OF MY REPORTED DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE SAME AS YOUR- NUMBER THE PAGE NUMBERS BUT IN MY REPORT HERE. DOWN BELOW THAT LIST OF A THROUGH F. IT SAYS. IT SAYS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE GRIEVANCES WERE RETAINED AT THE PRESENT LEVEL. IN CHARACTERIZED AS ROUTINE GRIEVANCES- INDICATE ON A WHOLESALE BASIS SAID EDA IS RETAINED AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS A AS A CATEGORY BUT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY THAT THE O. I. G. ESTIMATES AT FORTY TWO HUNDRED OF THESE MAY HAVE BEEN MISS CHARACTERIZED AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A STAFF OF MISCONDUCT GRIEVANCE. SO WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES IF. SOME OF THOSE ARE ARE ADA. ISSUES IN TERMS OF THE LIABILITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE HAVE TO HAVE YOU. AN OPINION ON THAT OR AS COUNCIL. BUT WAITED ON THE. SO THE- THE FOCUS OF OUR REPORT WAS WHETHER STAFF MISCONDUCT- WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE ACTIVITIES SO- WHERE YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE A GRIEVANCE THAT THE PERSON WASN'T PROPERLY ACCOMMODATED. YOU CAN TAKE TWO FORMS ONE THAT- I NEEDED A WHEELCHAIR AND THEY JUST GAVE ME A WALKER- NO ALLEGATION THAT STAFF DID SOMETHING WRONG JUST THAT THE PERSON IS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE- WITH THE RESOLUTION OF THEIR REQUEST- THAT WOULD BE A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE- IT WOULD ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND- AND- TELL THE PERSON WHETHER THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR MIND ABOUT WHERE THEY GET A WHEELCHAIR. CONTRAST THAT WITH- SOMEBODY WHO SAYS THAT- AN OFFICER TOOK THEIR CAME AWAY FROM THEM FOR NO REASON. AND THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO HAVE THAT CAME. OF THAT WOULD BE THEN AN ALLEGATION OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. AND UNDER THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF THAT IT JUST STAYS AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE UNDER THE ADA PROCESS. WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT THOSE THE QUALITY OF THAT ACT. OF SHOULD QUALIFY IT FOR INCLUSION IN THE GAMES MISCONDUCT. INQUIRY TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS OFFICER- DID IT. INTENTIONALLY REMOVED A REQUIRED ASSISTIVE DEVICE FROM UP FROM A PERSON WHO NEEDED IT. SO THAT'S THE I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE- THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THOSE NUMBER OF CASES WHERE. IN IN IN THE REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE WE LOOKED AT WE SAW THINGS THAT- CLEARLY IN OUR MIND. LOOK AT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE OFFICE OFFICER AS OPPOSED TO WHETHER THE PERSON- WAS TREATED ACCORDING TO. THEIR OWN INTERNAL PROCESSES AND SIMPLY DIDN'T LIKE THE END RESULT. YOUR APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION OF IN BOTH EXAMPLES THAT YOU GAVE DO YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT- THE DEPARTMENT IS REACHING CLOSURE. IN EITHER CASE. WELL MISCONDUCT OR NOT A IS IT ARE YOU CONFIDENT BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SEEN THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS THAT THOSE CLAIMS. UNDER STAFF MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT- COOPER. ARE BEING CLOSED OUT A REACHING CLOSURE. BY THE SYSTEM. CON MISCONDUCT OR NOT. WELL THEY'RE BEING CLOSED OUT BY THE SYSTEM- THE ISSUE IS WHETHER THEY ARE UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT UP PROCESS WHICH WE DON'T MONITOR AND WE HAVE NO VISIBILITY ON OR WHETHER IT GOES THROUGH A MISCONDUCT- EVALUATION AT AN- UNDER WHICH WE DO MONITOR. GREAT IN THE END THE MONTH MY CONCERN IS THE AUDIT TRAIL AROUND. AROUND THOSE THAT THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS IT'S- HI THERE I'M TRYING TO RAISE TODAY SPECIFICALLY WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR OTHER QUESTIONS IS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE GET TO CLOSURE ON THESE EIGHTY EIGHT CLAIMS ARE WE- LEAVING AN AUDIT TRAIL- ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S UNRESOLVED EDA CLAIMS. THAT COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION. IN A NIGHT IF I DO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION WHICH IS. MAYBE A COMET RELATIVE TO THE SECRETARY'S REQUEST FOR CAMERAS. DOES IT MAKE SENSE. TO PUT CAMERAS ON THE SITUATION- NOT KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT WE'RESUPER REACHING CLOSURE IN ON THESE ISSUES. FROM A STATE LIABILITY STILL POINT. WITH REGARD TO THE ADA PROCESS THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN- IN THE PRISONS WELL LOOKING AT THE VERY THINGS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE INDICATING SO I KNOW THAT- THAT THESE ATTORNEYS GO IN AND DO WHAT THEY CALL ARMSTRONG TOURS AND THEY LOOK AT WHATEVER DOCUMENTATION THE DEPARTMENT HAS- THE DEPARTMENT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A- A PROCESS BY WHICH DAY- RECORD ALL OF THESE. EIGHTY EIGHT ALLEGATIONS AND- AND THEN THESE ADVOCATES LOOK AT THOSE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROPERLY ADDRESSED THEM OR NOT AGAIN THAT'S OUTSIDE THE PURVIEW OF OUR- MONITORING- BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS THAT THAT IS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF THE- LITIGATION THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WITH THE ADVOCATES THAT- FROM WHAT I'VE READ IN IN THE ARMSTRONG PLEADINGS. OF THOSE ISSUES ARE ROUTINELY RAISED IN THE ARMSTRONG REPORTS- SO OFTEN BUT BUT TO ANSWER DIRECTLY YOUR QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE IN HOW THE PROCESS. OF IN ARMSTRONG GENERALLY IS ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES. WELL HOW IT WAS IS THIS IS MY IS MY STAFF'S INTERPRETATION OR IS THIS YOUR STATEMENT OR RENDITION OF YOUR STATEMENT THE FORTY TWO HUNDRED. OF THE FORTY THOUSAND SEVENTY THREE GRIEVANCES MAY HAVE BEEN MISS CHARACTERIZED AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. ARE THOSE YOUR NUMBERS YES YES THOSE ARE THOSE ARE- THOSE ARE NUMBERS BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF SOURCE DOCUMENTS WHERE- THE GRIEVANCE- CLEARLY SAID IN HIS- IN HIS GRIEVANCE THAT OFFICER SO AND SO WAS FOR EXAMPLE DISHONEST WHEN HE DID WHAT I WHAT. WHAT I'M ACCUSING HIM OF DOING- AND- WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE TRUTH YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T GET TO THE TRUTH UNTIL YOU UNTIL YOU INVESTIGATE BUT- IN OUR MIND OF THOSE THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS STAFF MISCONDUCT CLAIMS BUT BECAUSE THEY DEALT WITH ADA. OF WARDENS ROUTINELY RE CATEGORIZE THOSE TO ROUTINE APPEALS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCES AND ASSIGN THEM THROUGH THE- THE ADA PROCESS THROUGH AN ATA WARD. INTO THAT IS THE REASON THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT. THERE THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT. IN A POSITION. TO SEE THOSE COME THROUGH THE AIMS PROCESS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING THEY WERE LIKELY MIS CHARACTERIZING SHOULD COME THROUGH THE AIMS PROCESS IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND- IF IT GOES THROUGH A CENTRALIZED AIMS PROCESS. THEN I CAN HAVE PEOPLE THERE TO MONITOR THAT PROCESS AND FERRET OUT THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES- THE WAY IT CURRENTLY- IS STRUCTURED. OTHERS THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT PRISONS THERE'S THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT- ACTORS IN THIS AND WE ARE NOT- WE'RE NOT INVOLVED AT THE- LEVEL WHEN AWARDING MAKES THAT DECISION BECAUSE- WE- WE HAVE NO RESOURCES TO GO TO THAT LEVEL. AND REVIEW THOSE WE ARE LOOKING AT WHAT COMES TO AIMS AND THEN MAKING A DETERMINATION BASED ON WHAT WE SEE THERE. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M NOT TRYING TO IMPUTE OR ASSIGNED TO YOU THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GOING DEEPER INTO THE ADA PROCESS I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ANY PERCENTAGE OF FORTY TWO HUNDRED- MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS. IN TERMS OF ROUTINE GRIEVANCES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. YOU KNOW MY SCENARIO YOU GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES WOULD BE A AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS COMPLAINING THAT HE OR SHE HASN'T RECEIVED THEIR MATS WILL ASK FOR THEM WAS NOT RECEIVED WAS DENIED. AND SUBSEQUENT PLAINTIFF'S COUNSEL COMES THROUGH AND SAYS. TELL ME ABOUT THAT- WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU AGREE WITH THAT MY OPINION IS WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO. CORRECT THAT IN THE IND OF BEHAVIOR IN ADVANCE THROUGH TRAINING- OR DISAPPOINT BUT JUST DISAPPOINT. SO THAT THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO GET OUT HERE AND THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE- FIT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT AGREE WITH ENOUGH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU- UNFORTUNATELY THAT CAN'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE GRIEVANCE GETS ASSIGNED TO THE PROPER CATEGORY- BECAUSE IF IT REMAINS AS A ROUTINE GRIEVANCE. THEN THERE WILL BE NO EMPHASIS ON THE BEHAVIOR STAFF. REALLY THANK YOU IS- JUST- JUST WANT TO ASK- YOU KNOW THROUGH THE CHAIR IF THERE WAS ANYONE NOT THE- A GPS SOMETHING IS A RESPONSIBILITY YOU CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT AN ISSUE LIKE THAT- WHICH MIGHT. SUGGEST HAVING HAVING LEGAL COUNSEL LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR THE STATE. TO CONTRIVE YOUR A CONFIDENTIAL OF OPINION ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE OPINION ON HOW MUCH EXPOSURE THERE MAY BE IF THIS MIS CHARACTERIZATION CONTINUE NUMBER BY THE- I. G. IS ANYWHERE NEAR CORRECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REFERRAL PROCESS IS BEING NEW AROUND HERE TO TRY TO GET- THE- COUNCIL TO. OPINE ON THAT IS THAT IS THAT. A SEPARATE REFERRAL THROUGH LEDGE COUNCIL. WE COULD. OKAY SHE DIED OF AIDS THE STAFF. AND THAT'S THAT WE CAN THAT'S RIGHT- DIVE INTO THAT'LL BIT MORE IN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO FOCUS ON A PARTICULAR AREA THANKS VERY GOOD I DO WANNA- BRING UP IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE I THINK WITH SOMETHING ON ISSUE THAT CENTER NEWMAN. RAISED IS- WHEN AIMS WAS ESTABLISHED IT WAS IN TWENTY NINETEEN- THEY WERE FORTY SEVEN POSITIONS. OF THAT CAME WITH IT AND IT WAS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WAS BASED ON. SOMETHING IF I HAVE THIS RIGHT SOMETHING LIKE FOUR HUNDRED OF COMPLAINTS. OF PER MONTH- IT'S NOT THE- ANYWHERE NEAR THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK IN TERMS OF RESOURCES. IS IT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OR IS IT HOW THE CURRENT RESOURCES ARE ARE BEING USED OR NOT USED AND I THINK THAT WAS. THERE WAS REFERENCE TO THAT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS TO THE- WHAT WHAT WHAT THE AVERAGE COST OF THE CASE. WAS OF HIM BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AND STAFF TIME THAT WAS. AVAILABLE I DON'T KNOW IF I GOT THAT RIGHT MISTER WESLEY. THE YES MADAM CHAIR THE- OF WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT- AIMS IN A IN THE B. C. P. THAT WAS PRESENTED AND I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT- MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE WORK- WITH THE AMOUNT OF WORK- THAT THEY CAN DO NOW- BUT THEY PROMISED FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR- INCREASE PER MONTH- BASED ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE THEY'RE DOING ONE OR TWO A MONTH- THERE IF THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY- BELOW. WHAT THEY PROMISED THEY WOULD DO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER IS AND- SECRETARY ALLISON HAS INDICATED THEY'RE DOING- A WORK STUDY TO SEE. WHAT THAT RIGHT NUMBER IS- BUT- MY IMPRESSION IS THAT. AT THE MOMENT THEY COULD PROBABLY DO MORE AND THEY'RE NOT DOING IT AND SO. I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY COULD DO FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR A MONTH MAYBE THEY COULD- BUT THEY'RE SIMPLY NOT WORKING TO- TO THE- TO THE ABILITY THAT I THINK THEY COULD. EVEN IF IT'S LESS THAN THE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR MONTH- SO THAT WAS THAT WAS FAR OUR POINT. YEAH. OKAY- THE- SORRY WE GOT WE GOT INTO THIS OF WHAT THE ALEJO'S OFFICE. RESPOND. CAITLIN O'NEILL WITH THAT ARE YOU KNOW SORRY YOU OUT OF ALL THIS. CONVERSATION SHOULD RECALL THEN YOU SOONER- THAT'S FINE. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THAT PROPOSAL RELATED TO THIS ITEM WHICH I KNOW IS ACTUALLY NEXT UP ON THE AGENDA- IN THE CONTEXT OF THE- AG'S RECENT REPORT AS WELL AS THE NEW INFORMATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS- PRESENTED TODAY AS FAR AS CHANGES IT'S MAKING TO THE- TO THE AIMS PROGRAM. SO TO THE EXTENT WE DO HAVE AN ANALYSIS SHARING RECOMMENDATIONS WHILST YOU KNOW CERTAINLY COMMUNICATE THAT TO STAFF- BUT I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO PROVIDE A FEW PIECES OF ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION- AT THIS TIME THREE PIECES SPECIFICALLY TO KIND OF EXPAND ON. WHAT YOU HEARD AND GENERALLY PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL ON HIS TRAIN CONTEXT FOR THAT COMMITTEE. FIRST REPORTS OF SERIOUS OFFICER MISCONDUCT ARE NOT NEW AND HAVE BEEN REPORTED AT SEVERAL PRISONS BY MULTIPLE REPUTABLE SOURCES. INCLUDING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. EXPERTS AND EVEN EASIER ON STAFF. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER VISITING THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH IS A FACILITY WHERE THERE'S BEEN. A NUMEROUS VERY STATIC CONCERNING ALLEGATION MADE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF- MISS CONTACT CONTACT SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO DISABLED INMATES. CDC OURS I SENT A STRONG TEAM TO THAT PRISON- TO INTERVIEW INMATES. SURROUNDING THOSE OUT AND CC CHIEF ON BUT OMBUDSMEN WHO WROTE- TWO LEADING LEADERSHIP FOLLOWING A VISIT EXPRESSED GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT WHAT SHE OBSERVED THERE ARE HEARD THERE URGED IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND NOTED THAT THE ALLEGATIONS WERE THE WORST SHE'S HEARD IN HER CAREER. AND THE SECOND POINT IS THAT CONCERNS ABOUT C. SHARES ABILITY TO HANDLE STAFF MISCONDUCT ARE ALSO NOT NEW AND HAVE ALSO BEEN RAISED BY MULTIPLE REPUTABLE SOURCES IN ADDITION TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL- FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE REPORT BY THAT STRIKE TEAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- THE REPORT SAID QUOTE D. IN MADE ALLEGATIONS TAKEN AS A WHOLE SEEM TO DISCRIMINATE BERMAN WITH NO RELIEF MECHANISM FOR AND MADE TO FEEL MISTREATED BY CUSTODY STAFF. MOREOVER ON A AN EXPERT WITNESS IN THE ARMSTRONG VERSUS NATION CASE- WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MOMENT- WHO HAD REVIEWED THE USE OF FORCE TO DISCIPLINE SYSTEMS IN JAILS ACROSS THE COUNTRY STATED IN A COURT DECLARATION THAT CDCR SYSTEM IS. THE WORST HE'S SEEN IN HIS CAREER. AND TO KIND OF COMPOUND UPON CONCERNS AROUND CAESARS ABILITY TO HANDLE IN MALAGA DACIANS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT I WOULD JUST NOTE- AS MISTER WESLEY ALLUDED TO THAT- LEGISLATORS RAISE CONCERNS OVER- CDCR REGULATIONS- BY. THE DEPARTMENT PROMULGATED REGULATIONS FOR THE NEW AIMS PROCESS DESPITE THOSE CONCERNS- AND- AND DESPITE GIVING LEGISLATORS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE REGULATIONS IN ADVANCE- THIRD THE STATE IS- INVOLVED IN ONGOING LITIGATION ON THESE ISSUES SPECIFICALLY- IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY PLAINTIFFS IN AN ONGOING CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. KNOWN AS ARMSTRONG THE NEW SIM. WHICH HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS CONCERNING THE DEPARTMENT'S TREATMENT OF INMATES WITH DISABILITIES FILED A MOTION ALLEGING THAT OFFICERS AT RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO WERE ASSAULTING ABUSING AND RETALIATING AGAINST INMATES WITH DISABILITIES DISABILITIES. ARE THE PLAINTIFFS ALSO ARGUE THAT THE PRISON SYSTEM FOR RESPONDING TO THESE ALLEGATIONS IS AN ADEQUATE. AND IN SEPTEMBER THE COURT HEY IN THAT CASE ORDERED CDCR TO DEVELOP- A PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS RJD AND REQUIRE THAT THE PLAN INCLUDES CERTAIN ELEMENTS SUCH AS BODY WORN CAMERAS WE'RE GOING TO BE HEARING. ABOUT PLAN IS THE IMPETUS FOR THAT BUDGET PROPOSAL WILL HEREBY NINE TO- AND THEN FINALLY IN JUNE PLAINTIFFS IN THAT CASE FILED A MOTION ALLEGING THAT THE MISCONDUCT AND INADEQUATE SYSTEMS FOR HANDLING IT- WIDE SYSTEMIC AND REQUESTING STATEWIDE RELIEF HOWEVER THE COURT IS STILL CONSIDERING- CONSIDERING THAT MOTION. THANK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL. BINANCE THANK YOU. MISTER YOU. THE ONLY THING SHE WOULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME OKAY. OKAY I DON'T KNOW IF- SECRETARY IF YOU WANNA OF FINAL WORD ON THIS BUT- IT APPEARS FROM EVERY DIRECTION ALL OF THESE ARE EXTREMELY SERIOUS ISSUES. I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW AND SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF. OF ALL WHAT'S BEING- THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEING GIVEN TO US BY THE- INSPECTOR GENERAL- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. RATHER THAN IT GETTING MORE SERIOUS TO THE POINT OF MORE LITIGATION MORE LIABILITY THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT IT'S ALSO LOOKING THAT THE WELL BEING OF BOTH THE OFFICERS AND THE INMATES- THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING. MUCH MORE DRAMATICALLY DONE AND CHANGED HERE TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE ISSUES THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIFICS HERE THAT WE COULD BE ASKING BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE'S GOTTA BE OF FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE AND I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION. ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE MOST RECENT AND NOT JUST SOMETHING WAY IN THE PAST BUT MOST RECENT. THAT OF DOESN'T LEAD IN ANY OTHER DIRECTION EXCEPT TO SOME FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEMIC CHANGE SO I REALLY- EXPECT THAT THAT'S WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WILL INCLUDE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO SEE OURSELVES COMING BACK WITH MORE AND MORE. OF ORDERS FROM THE COURTS AND WE SEEM TO. OF LET THINGS MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEN THE COURTS HAVE TO INTERVENE THE LAWSUITS AND WE FIND OURSELVES UNDER COURT ORDERS TO DO THINK SO. WHY DO WE HAVE TO END UP IN THAT IN THAT SITUATION BRUCE'S MAKING THE CHANGE OURSELVES- UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE OR SELF CARRYING IT OUT. OF CHANGES IN TRAINING CHANGES AND HOW WE HANDLE THESE ISSUES. EVERYTHING THAT'S INVOLVED IN IT AND IF WE'RE GONNA DO A PIECEMEAL HERE AND THERE WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES UNDER MORE COURT ORDERS. AND THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY REASON THAT SHOULD CONCERN US BUT IT'S A BIG REASON THAT SHOULD CONCERN US. IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT TO OUR STATE AND IT'S COSTLIER. AND THE LIVES OF SO MANY PEOPLE ARE IMPACTED BY THIS SO. OF IF YOU WANT YOU COULD- HAVE A- FINAL WORD HERE. SECRETARY OR WE COULD MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ISSUE. THANK YOUMA'AM I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY- I DO FEEL TRAINING IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT I FEEL CAMERAS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS. OF FOR A STATE AND AS WELL AS OUR REQUIRES AN INVESTIGATION PROCESS IN ORDER FOR US TO BE A DEPARTMENT OF INTEGRITY THEY ALL GO HAND IN HAND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO. THE SUPPORT FOR ON OUR CURRENT REQUESTED ANY FUTURE REQUESTS. AS RELATES TO THOSE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN ALLEVIATE ON. ANY KIND OF MISCONDUCT WHETHER REAL OR PERCEIVED AND SO I DO THINK THAT THERE IS EVIDENCE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FUTURE EVIDENCE. OF OUR CAMERAS TO RESOLVE MANY OF THESE ISSUES- WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE PRE AND POST- CAMERA IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEW INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED- LOOK FORWARD TO THE SAME AND- R. J. DONOVAN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY JUST KNOW THAT I AS THE SECRETARY OF THIS ORGANIZATION I AM COMMITTED. TO MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES- FOR THE BETTERMENT OF OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION AS WELL AS OUR STAFF. THANK YOU I'LL WE MOVE ON NOW SENATORS.

I WOULD LIKE TO NOW INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR MARION SPEARMINT WHO'S HERE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAMERA CLASS INCLUDED IN THIS. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND- SENATORS MY NAME IS MERRY INSTRUMENT ON THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF WORK FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS REHABILITATION I'M GONNA GO OVER A COUPLE THINGS THE FIRST THING IS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT ORDERED CDCR IN ARMSTRONG LITIGATION INSTALL SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS IN AREAS OF THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. OR INCARCERATE HAVE ACCESS. AND IT WAS AREAS OF OUR RECREATION YARDS HOUSING UNITS FINDING HOLES PROGRAM AREAS GYMNASIUM'S THAT'D BE DONE WITHIN NINETY DAYS. THE CORK IN THAT ORDER ALSO ORDERED US TO BEGIN USING BODY WORN CAMERAS FOR ALL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AT RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY BUT HE- MAY HAVE INTERACTION WITH PROTECTED CLASS MEMBERS OF THE ARMSTRONG LITIGATION IN SIXTY DAYS. THREE ZERO ALSO ORDER IN THAT TO RETAIN ALL FOOTAGE FOR MAX MINIMUM OF NINETY DAYS AND THE FOOTAGE OF USE OF FORCE AND OTHER TRIGGERING EVENTS INVOLVING ARMSTRONG REMEDIAL PLAN CLASS MEMBERS AT THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY WOULD BE RETAINED INDEFINITELY. AND THAT FOOTAGE WHEN AVAILABLE BE REVIEWED AND CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. OF ANY INCIDENT OUR DEPARTMENT ALSO WAS VERY PROACTIVE. WE GOT THE ORDER AND SO WE A LIKE TO REQUIRE CORRECTIONAL SERGEANTS AT RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY WHERE BODY WORN CAMERAS TO WEAR BODY WORN CAMERAS AS A HAVE MAY HAVE INTERACTION WITH PROTECTED CLASS MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FROM REMEDIAL. PLANS THERE. SO IN JANUARY NINETEENTH WE WERE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF OF THIS YEAR THE USE OF BODY WORN CAMERAS WAS IMPLEMENTED AT RJD THROUGH AN INSTRUCTION MEMORANDUM. ISSUED BY DIRECTOR GIPSON. AND PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE ALL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS SERGEANTS AND LIEUTENANTS WERE PROVIDED IN SERVICE TRAINING ON BODY WORN CAMERA POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF BODY WORN CAMERA TECHNOLOGIES TO GIVE. OUR DEPARTMENT THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT AFTER THE FACT REVIEWS OF STAFF USE OF FORCE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT. IN INVESTIGATIONS AND HELP IDENTIFY NEW AREAS IN THE ACTIVITY. ALL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS SERGEANTS HAVING INTERACTION AND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR DUTIES WITH THAT POPULATION OR HAVE THAT HAVE A BUY ONE CAMERA ISSUE THAT THE POSITION THAT THEY ARE WORKING BACK GATE. AND THE BODY WORN CAMERAS TO BE TURNED ON DURING THE ENTIRE COURSE OF THEIR SHIFT. A BREAKDOWN OF THE AUDIO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE FIXED CAMERAS AND BIOWARE CAMERAS IS AS GOES WE'RE A STALLING APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIXED SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS- THE MINIMUM SUPPORT FACILITY REMAINER AREAS OF INMATES. AFTER TRAVEL AND CONGREGATION RJD AND WE'RE ALSO IMPLEMENTING. OXALATE SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE BODY WORN CAMERAS AT RJD. IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS REQUEST AS MISTRUST OUR SECRETARY SAID AND NOT. JUST ONCE INSTEAD IT INVOLVES- THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE'RE LOOKING TO INSTALL POSSIBLY TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE FIX CAMERAS AT OUR FACILITIES B. AND B. AT THAT INSTITUTION. BUT AS WITH MANY EARLIER UP. AUDIO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS IS NOT REALLY NEW TO OUR DEPARTMENT THEY'VE BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE AWHILE HOWEVER WE BEGUN PROCESS OF INSTALLING THESE CAMERAS- THE NEW HIGHER DEFINITION IN. AT HIGH DESERT STATE PRISON ACT THAT THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S FACILITY AT CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SAN QUENTIN AND A CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO. AND THE BENEFITS OF A STOLEN THESE FIXED CAMERAS THAT ARE UP HìNH IN THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IS TO IDENTIFY SUSPECTS IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS. SOMETIMES THINGS ARE LOST OR MISPLACED OR EVEN STOLEN. AND WE CAN USE THOSE CAMERAS TO HELP US IN THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AND BY DOING THAT THOSE CAMERAS AT EIGHT IT DOES WARN THAT THOSE PRISONS- CHIU AND I HAVE A LENGTHY SEARCHES LOCKDOWNS WHICH AFFECT OFFENDER PROGRAMMING BECAUSE THE CAMERA WAS ABLE TO SHOW US EXACTLY WHAT WAS MISPLACED LOST OR SOMETHING WAS TAKEN OFF BROWN'S. AT WE HAD CAMERAS WE DO HAVE CAMERAS AT OUR FRONT GATE ISSUES RIGHT OUT THE GATE. THEY ALSO SAYS WHEN EIGHT- NONEMPTY. INTRODUCES CONTRABAND ON PRISON GROUNDS. WE HAVE OUR MINIMUM SUPPORT FACILITIES WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OUR SECURE PERIMETER SO MANY TIMES PEOPLE DRIVE CLOSE ON THE HOURS ALSO THAT JACKSON TO THE PROPERTY LINE NOT ON PRISON GROUNDS AND THEY'LL THROW CONTRABAND OVER A FENCE THE PROPERTY LINE FENCE AND THEN IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL A MINIMUM SUPPORT FACILITY IN MAKING GO OUT AND GRAB THAT SO THOSE FIXED CAMERAS. HELP WITH THAT ALSO. AND THEY ALSO HELP DETER THE INTRODUCTION OF CONTRABAND INTO A PRISON. AND IDENTIFY EMPLOYEES YES I SAID EMPLOYEES. VOLUNTEERS CONTRACTORS ATTORNEYS VISITORS AND INMATES DISCOVERY INTRODUCING CONTRABAND INTO THE PRISON THEY'RE VERY VERY HELPFUL. AND A PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA TO REVIEW IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALLEGATIONS MADE. AGAINST STATE STAFF OR OTHER INMATES. AND IT ALSO FACILITATES OUR DEPARTMENT DEBILITY TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. AND TO IDENTIFY PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENCE WITHIN OUR PRISONS. BODY WORN CAMERAS NOW NEW TECHNOLOGY AND DETENTION CENTERS THE TENSION LOCATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IT'S NOT WIDELY USED BY VERY MANY CORRECTIONAL AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE RJD IMPLEMENTATION WILL GIVE UP OUR DEPARTMENT OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. AND IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING AND SEE IF THEY REALLY DO WORK. EVEN NOBODY OR CAMERAS ARE NEW TO CDCR. AND CORRECTIONAL SETTING IN GENERAL ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE READILY ACKNOWLEDGE OF BODY WORN CAMERAS PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY AND RESOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT INAPPROPRIATE USE OF FORCE AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. THEY ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DATA TO REVIEW IN CONJUNCTION WITH INVESTIGATIONS OF AN INCIDENT. AND LASTLY IF A STAFF MEMBER STAFF WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IF BAY INTENSELY DEACTIVATE THEIR CAMERAS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WHEN A PERSON COMES ON SHIFT THEIR CAMERAS TO BE ACTIVATED AND TURNING ON INTO THE END OF THEIR SHIFT. SO IF SOMEONE WAS A DE ACTIVATE THEIR CAMERA. INTENSELY DURING AN INCIDENT AND THAT WOULD BE REFERRED TO THE HIRING AUTHORITY THE WARDEN- IN THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE REFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND- DISCIPLINARY ACTION BE TAKEN ON THAT IT COULD BE AT CORRECTIVE ACTION OR GET COULD WIND UP BEING ADVERSE PERSONNEL ACTIONS OUR SECOND TRIP MENTION. IT COULD BE A LETTER OF REPRIMAND A LOSS OF PAY A DEMOTION OR DISMISSAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CASE. ALSO ON A LIGHTER NOTE IF SOMEONE WAS TO BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I CAMERA CAN BE DEACTIVATED AND ONE EXAMPLE IS SOMEONE GOES AND USE THE BATHROOM. SO THEY TURN OUR CAMERA IF A PERSON WAS COME OUT THE BATHROOM AND ANY INCIDENTS TAKING PLACE YOU KNOW WITHIN. CAN A FIFTEEN YARD IN IN IN A PROGRAM OFFICE OR IN A BUILDING AND THEY- REACT TO STOP THE INCIDENT ANDTHEY DON'T TRIGGER CAMARON. THEN ON A SITUATION LIKE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOMEONE TRAINING AND REMIND THEM YOU KNOW KINDA KEEP YOURS STAY FOCUSED REMEMBER TO TURN YOUR CAMARON. YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE RESPONDING TO AN INCIDENT JUST AS YOU EXIT THE BATHROOM. SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE A BINARY CAMERAS I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO YOU. AND I'M AVAILABLE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SPEARMAN- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- I THINK YOU ALREADY ANSWERED THIS- OF THE BODY WORN CAMERAS EXIST AT OTHER PRISONS THEY DO IT EXIST AT OTHER PRISONS- BUT THERE THERE WILL BE NEW. IN OUR PRISONS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS CORRECT MA'AM SURE THEY EXIST IN PRISON SO I KNOW THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS HASBEEN THEIR BUSINESS BUT- RJD WILL BE THE ONLY PRESENT IN OUR SYSTEM HAS SOME RIGHT NOW. OKAY AND YOUR PLANS DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO EXPAND INTO OTHER. AT THIS TIME THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT OUR SECRETARY IN ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE A DECISION ON INSIDE I MANAGING ONCE WE LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS THESE CAMERAS THEY'LL UP THEY'LL- MAKE A DECISION ON THAT. AND THE REASON WE HAVE A ONLY AT R. J. D. IS BECAUSE OF THE COURT ORDER. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. OF AND- WITH REGARDS TO THE VIDEO- WE SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW FILM BY THE BY THE CAMERA. HOW ARE YOU STORING IT AND- HOW LONG WILL YOU STORE THE VIDEO AND- DO YOU REVIEW THE RIP VIDEO WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO AND FOR HOW LONG. THE VIDEO ALL AUDIO VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AND BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE IT R. J. D. WILL BE RETAINED FOR NINETY DAYS ON THE VIDEO MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AND THEN IF THERE IS A TRIGGERING EVENT. OF MAYBE WE'LL SAY ALLEGATIONS OF EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE IF THERE'S SOME TYPE OF USE OF DEADLY FORCE- THEN THE INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES UNIT STAFF WHAT EXPORT BACK FOOTAGE TO A SECURE LOCAL SERVER AND THEY WILL ALSO EXPORT THAT FOOTAGE AND PUT IT ON A DVD FOR EVIDENCE PURPOSES. AND AGAIN ANY TO REITERATE ANY USE OF FORCE OR TRIGGERING EVENT INVOLVING- AGAIN MATE WHO'S A CLASS MEMBER OF THE ARMS OR MEDIA PLAN. THAT ACTUAL FOOTAGE WILL BE RETAINED OR RETAINED INDEFINITELY. OKAY THANK YOU ARE A FEW OTHERS ON ANOTHER ISSUE- WE HAVE- LA- PLEASE. THE FOOD. L. L. WHERE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT AS WELL AS THE CHANGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT INDICATES IT INTENDS TO MAKE AT THIS SPRING SO TO THE EXTENT WE DO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS WE WILL CERTAINLY GET THOSE TO STAFF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY. OKAY BEFORE WE GET TO OF FINANCE PLEASE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS THE CENTER COURT AS HE THANK YOU MA'AM SURE. FOR THE OLEO- I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE STILL OPEN TO MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON ON THIS ISSUE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CHOICE ABOUT GETTING- CAMERAS INSTALLED NOR NOR IS IT A BAD THING IT IN MY OPINION INHERENTLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT OTHER LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT I'VE I'VE SUPPORTED. OF AS NECESSARY AND GOOD OVER THE LONG TERM MY QUESTION IS GIVEN SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE- AND PERHAPS YOU YOU HEARD SOME OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ITEM- DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS. IN TERMS OF- THE P. OR CALL THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN- GRIEVANCE PROCESSES GRIEVANCE PROCESS SEEN- TRAINING ISSUES IN AND GETTING THESE CAMERAS UP AND RUNNING- IN THE ABSENCE OF A LOT OF THAT WORK- HAVING BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. THAT WERE BEING- DISCIPLINARY REVIEW IN TRAINING. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING IF WE HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CAMERAS. YES I'M REALLY ASKING YOU A LITTLE BIT AND QUICKER QUESTION PROBABLY GIVING YOUR YOUR PARTICULAR STATION OF LIFE IS GOOD- DO YOU AVE LIABILITY CONCERNS I MEAN THIS THIS IS. HELLO REPORT IS PIVOTING- OFF OF THE ARMSTRONG LAWSUIT SO I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT FOR IT ASK YOU KNOW FOR. A LEGAL OPINION UNLESS YOU INTERNET BUT- BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HERE IN THAT CAPACITY IN ANY CASE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF WITH SERVICE SEEN IN THE L. A. ALWAYS CAN IS. AT ALL CONCERNED WITH- THE LIABILITY THAT MAY ARISE ONCE WE GET THESE CAMERAS UP GIVEN UP SOME OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN IN THE LAST TWO ITEMS IN TERMS OF GAPS IN IN TRAINING THE DISCIPLINARY PROCESS. IN RIGHT I REALIZE THAT SO PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF A LOADED QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAD. A THOUGHT ON. YOU'RE CORRECT I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY- AND- WE'RE STILL. AS I SAID ANALYZING THE PROPOSAL I WILL I CAN SAY THOUGH AT THIS POINT THAT WE ARE THE STATE IS BEING SUED ACTIVELY ON. ON THE- PROCESSES FOR HANDLING IN MADE ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT AND HAS BEEN ORDERED- TO IMPLEMENT A REMEDIAL PLAN. THAT INVOLVES IMPLEMENTATION OF CAMERAS- AND THERE'S THE PLAINTIFFS AND NOT LAWSUIT HAVE. ORDERED THE STATE- SORRY EXCUSE ME HAVE SUBMITTED A MOTION TO IN THE ARMSTRONG COURT- ALLEGING THAT THIS EVENING THESE. THIS MISCONDUCT IS OCCURRING AT OTHER PRISONS IN AS WELL AND THAT- SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE STATE COULD BE IN A- ADDITION WORDS BEING REQUIRED TO ADD CAMERAS AT OTHER PRISONS- AS- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE MAYBE POINTING TO IS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM BETWEEN- WE NEED. CAMERAS TO ADDRESS- LITIGATION THAT'S HAPPENING BUT MAYBE THAT COULD PROMPT ADDITIONAL LITIGATION I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR YOU ON THAT- BUT I'M HAPPY TO- TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF AND SEE IF WE CAN BE OF GREATER ASSISTANCE. I THINK WE GOT ASSURANCES ON THE PER ITEM THAT WILL WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH LEGAL COUNSEL- YOU KNOW TO GET TO THAT. QUESTION- FOR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION- I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR REPORT I APPRECIATE ALL REPORTS DANGER IN ATTEMPT TO RESPOND TO THAT- MY CONCERN IN A IN A I'VE BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS A LIABILITY FOR THE STATE OF THE TREASURY ISSUE BUT I WANT TO HARKEN BACK TO SOMETHING THAT. ARCHER SAID ON THE PER ITEM I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING EMPLOYEES IN THE POSITION OF BOTH HAVING BODY WORN CAMERAS THE STATIONARY CAMERAS OBSERVING THEIR ACTIVITIES WHEN THEY HAVE NOT YET- BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED PERHAPS IN SOME AREAS LIKE ABA OF RESPONSE- CRISIS INTERVENTION- HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH CERTAIN KINDS OF SITUATIONS IN TERMS OF A- FROM AN INMATE. ACTING OR BEHAVING IN A CERTAIN WAY- MAYBE WE'RE GOOD TO GO THERE- MAYBE WE'RE NOT BUT IT JUST SEEMS BASED ON THE TWO ITEMS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW. IF IT PEOPLE BE MEDICALLY TRAINED AND I THINK TO YOUR POINT OF MANAGED CARE EARLIER- THIS. I THINK ARMSTRONG WAS BOOK WAS BOUGHT BROUGHT FOR HER AS IS THE SUIT PRIMARILY ON BEHALF OF INMATES- BUT IF WE ALSO SHOULD HAVE THE SAME HUMANISTIC CONCERN FOR. THE GOOD EMPLOYEES THAT WERE PUTTING- INTO A INTO A SITUATION PERHAPS WHERE THEY WERE THEY'RE NOT READY. TO HAVE THEIR ACTIONS- OBSERVED DOES THAT MEAN WE CAN DO WILL. YOU KNOW REJECT THE IDEA OF CAMERAS NO BUT IT COULD IT MIGHT MEAN THAT WE CAN ACCELERATE TRAINING- AND THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY GETTING AT HERE SO I JUST WANNA SHARE THOSE. COMMENTS WITH. MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE COMMITTEE PARTICULARLY. YES DOES ANYBODY FROM THE DEPARTMENT WANT TO. RESPOND TO THAT THE TRAINING. YEAH I THINK- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TWO THINGS AS ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR SPEARMAN POINTED OUT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED CAMERAS AND OTHER PRISONS AND THESE WERE PRISONS WHERE THERE WERE THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP- AND IT HAS BEEN WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER RESPECTFUL SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. OF OUR SHARE SOME STATISTICS ON THAT THE SECOND IS- THE LAST TIME I THINK WE MET WITH SO WE MET WITH SO YOUR COMMITTEE WE TALKED ABOUT A- TRAINING- PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE THAT GETS-INTO SORT OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND DEALING WITH REAL LIFE SITUATIONS WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE TRAINING FOR CADETS- THAT IS- THAT WILL PROVIDE THEM THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO PROVIDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS VERY STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT. THAT'S ALL I HAVE BEEN THINKING- I HAVE A COUPLE OF MORE QUESTIONS- THE MOTION FILED IN THE ARMSTRONG CASE. MENTIONED OF THESE SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS DISTURBING ALLEGATIONS THAT OTHER INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT INTEND TO EXPAND USE OF THE CHANGES. PLANNED AT RG- R. J. D. TO ALL PRISONS. I AT THIS POINT WE'RE UNDER A AS YOU KNOW WERE UNDER ACTIVE- AN ACTIVE LAWSUIT AND SO AND I'M UNFORTUNATE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY WE DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY WITH US- AT THIS POINT WE'VE AGREED TO THE CHANGES RGD WE ALSO AGREED TO THE CHANGES- AT L. A. C. BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE WERE. A TWO BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE YARDS WITH WE HAD A LARGE DEGREE OF ARMSTRONG- PLAINTIFFS SO I'M THOSE ARE THE- INSTITUTIONS WE'VE AGREED TO SO FAR WE ARE COMING INTO THIS WITH AN OPEN MIND THERE ALTHOUGH- ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR SPEARMINT MENTIONED THAT. SOME OF BODY WORN CAMERAS ARE USED TO THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY IT ISN'T VERY PREVALENT SO WE'RE COMING INTO THIS. UNDER A COURT ORDER OF COURSE BUT THE TO CUT BY CUT TO ME IS THAT WERE ALSO COMING INTO AND- TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS THE BEST WE CAN- TO BE AN EXAMPLE FOR. OTHER INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I HOPE IT'S AN EXAMPLE OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS AS WELL. IN THE IN THE STATE. OKAY THANK. I THINK THAT'S IT FOR MY QUESTIONS. ANYMORE NO MORE QUESTIONS OKAY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOLD OPEN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD ON THE HARD WORK THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING THANK YOU. I WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE NOW. ISSUE THREE IS THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION. WITHIN THE. THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- HOW THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY WHO'S GOING TO PRESENT. THAT'S ME MADAM CHAIR I'M- I AM THAT STEPHANIE WELCH AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- AND SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TODAY- I'M GOING TO BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW AND COVERING A FEW QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED. THE PROPOSAL ESTABLISHES THE OPPOSITE YOU THINK COMMUNITY RESTORATION WHICH- LOOKING FORWARD I'M GOING TO REFER TO AS THE L. Y. C. R. WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES THREE POINT FOUR MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION I'M GOING TO SUPPORT NINETEEN STAFF AND CONTRACTS FOR SPECIALTY SERVICES SUCH AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION EFFORTS. SB EIGHT TO THREE ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITHIN THE HHS WHICH- FROM THIS POINT FORWARD I'M GONNA REFER TO AS AGENCY AFFECTED JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION OF JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH BEING SERVED IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH DECADES OF REFORM HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ESTABLISHING IN THE OFFICE OF USING COMMUTER RESTORATION AGENCY BETTER ALIGNS WITH RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES THAT FOCUS ON REHABILITATION AND SUPPORT THE DELIVERY OF TRAUMA INFORMED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE BEING CLOSE TO HOME REDUCES RECIDIVISM THE- I SEE ARE WILL HELP SUPPORT THE LONG TERM AND SUSTAINED SUCCESS OF TRANSITIONING. REALIGN USED TO COUNTY BASED CUSTODY PROGRAMS AND SUPERVISION. I WAS IN THE OFFICE OF YOU THINK MAYBE RESTORATION AT AGENCY WILL FACILITATE LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF OUR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS. LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES EPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND OFFICES LIKE THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL WHICH CAN SUPPORT THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION IN ITS EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. WE ENVISION SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE OFFICE OF MUSIC COMMUNITY RESTORATION WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS TO SUPPORT STRONG EFFECTIVE CONNECTIONS TO LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS THE WILL BE SERVING NEEDS YOU. IN ADDITION TO OUR ARE PARTNERS IN PROBATION LIKE OUR HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE DEPARTMENT'S. THE NEW OFFICE. AS OUTLINED IN STATUTE WILL DO THE FOLLOWING. IDENTIFY AND DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES TO HELP INFORM REHABILITATIVE AND RESTORATIVE YOU PRACTICES INCLUDING EDUCATION. DIVERSION REENTRY BUT THEY JUST AND VICTIM SERVICES FOR ALL JUST JUSTICE INVOLVED YOUTH. OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS ADVISING ON HOW TO ACHIEVE OUTCOMES AND SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT FOR USE ACROSS THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ONCE DATA BECOMES AVAILABLE FROM THE DOJ WE WILL DEVELOP A REPORT ON THE FALCONS IN THE ENTIRE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE AND ONGOING THE REPORT ANNUALLY ON THE WORK OF THE OFFICE. WE WILL ALSO REVIEW COUNTY PLANS RELATED TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANT. AND WE WILL PROVIDE AND DELIVER ARMS PERSONS ROLES AND INCLUDING RECEDING ASSESSING RESOLVING AND REFERRING COMPLAINTS- ALSO CONSISTENT WITH ANY CONFIDENTIALITY RULES WE WILL REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE ON ISSUES THAT COME UP THROUGH THIS OFFICE. TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE TRANSITION OF JUSTICE INVOLVED USED TO LOCAL SUPERVISION AND REHABILITATION SB EIGHT TO THREE DIRECTS THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL TO ESTABLISH A COMMITTEE TO ADVISE AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND THE RESTORATION. OF RELATED TO THE POLICIES PROGRAMMES APPROACHES- IT SHOULD BE DONE. TO IMPROVE USE OUTCOMES REDUCE YOUTH DETENTION AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM OR REAL LINES YOU. THE CWC SOME OF OUR COUNCIL ESTABLISHED THIS COMMITTEE BACK IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE SINCE THEN BEGAN TO MEET. THE WHAT IS THE R. WILL PROVIDE STAFFING TO THIS COMMITTEE- IN ORDER TO ELICIT AND EXAMINE AND OPERATIONALIZE THEIR EXPERTISE AND THEN THE COMMITTEE DOES SUNSET ARE AT THE END I'M SORRY AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY THREE- THE STAFF HAS ASKED ME A FEW QUESTIONS AND I THINK- UNLESS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO PAUSE HERE TO TAKE QUESTIONS I WILL JUST. LAUNCH INTO MY RESPONSES TO THOSE QUESTIONS. OKAY I HAD. OKAY- PLEASE WATER THREE YEAR PROPOSED ORGANIZATIONAL CHART SO IN YOUR AGENDA YOU HAVE EIGHT- DOCUMENT DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS OUR ORGANIZATIONAL CHART- AS AN OFFICE BUT THEN SEES THAT WITHIN AGENCY- LEADERSHIP ULTIMATELY IS RESPONSIBLE TO THE UNDERSECRETARY WHO IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- THE OFFICE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WILL OVERSEE A STAFF OF EIGHTEEN IN ADDITION TO CONTRACT FUNDS THAT WILL BE USED TO PROCURE ADDITIONAL SERVICES. THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE INCLUDES FIVE FULL TIME STAFF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHICH IS A CLASSIFICATION GAME CAREER EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT LEVELS SEE- A STAFF ATTORNEY AND THREE ANALYST AND IT STAFF. WE HAVE THAT IN THE CHART YOU'LL SEE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM AS WELL AS OUR IN HOUSE COUNSEL ALSO LIAISON WITH OUR OUR LARGER AGENCY. ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM SO THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPLIANCE FOR OUR IN HOUSE COUNSEL- THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO LIAISON WITH OUR CHIEF COUNSEL. FOR CONSULTATION ON MORE COMPLEX ISSUES. ALSO I'D LIKE TO ADD- CONSIDERING I'M A DEPUTY SECRETARY OF PART OF THE- THE ROLE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WILL ALSO TO BE A PART OF OUR EXECUTIVE TEAM AT CHS AND SO. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALSO HAVE REGULAR AND COLLABORATIVE INTERACTION. WITH OTHER DEPUTIES AND ASSISTANTS SECRETARIES LIKE MYSELF AND ALSO OUR TWELVE DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS THEIR DEPUTIES AS WELL AS OTHER OFFICE DIRECTORS SUCH AS THE SURGEON GENERAL- NEXT THE POLICY RESEARCH OPERATIONS UNIT CONSIST OF SEVEN FULL TIME STAFF- THIS UNIT WILL BE- IDENTIFYING AND DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES ASSESSING THE IMPACT F LOCAL PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. I RESEARCH DATA SPECIALIST WILL LEAD EFFORTS TO COMPLETE ANNUAL REPORTS- AND ALSO INTERPRET DATA AND PROVIDE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE AND EXPERTISE ON RESEARCH AND EVALUATION FOR THE OFFICE. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMAINING STAFF WILL EXECUTE THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE PERCENT IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY LIAISONS NOW THE COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT WHERE COUNTY LIAISONS RESIDE. ALSO INCLUDES SEVEN FULL TIME STAFF- THIS UNIT WILL BE REVIEWING THE COUNTY PLANS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM THE STAFF ALSO ACTS AS PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE COMPLETION OF THESE PLANS. AND CORRESPONDENCE WITH OUR LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION PARTNERS AS SUPERVISING MANAGER WILL WORK WITH THREE SPECIALIST AND TO ANALYSTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO REVIEW COLLECT AND ASSESS TRENDS AS WELL AS IDENTIFY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NEEDS BASED ON THE PLAN RUBIO. AND THE UNIT WILL BE ALSO RESPONSIBLE IN COLLABORATION FACT THAT OUR POLICY RESEARCH AN OPERATIONS UNIT TO ASSIST WITH ANY RESOLUTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT COME UP THROUGH THE ARMS PERSON FUNCTION- INCLUDING PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS PATTERNS. AND TO IMPROVE SERVICES- ENVISION THAT. FUNDS BEING USED TO IN NEST SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE- ON TRAINING OR EVOLVING SCIENCE OR THE EVOLVING SCIENCE AND ADDRESSING OF ADOLESCENT DEVELOPMENT- THE ISSUES AROUND COMPLEX TRAUMA. AND ANY KIND OF SPECIALTY EVALUATION THAT WE MAY NEED TO HAVE DONE. LASTLY WELL I AM STAFF MAY BE DONE IN TWO UNITS I HOPE IT WAS CLEAR OF ANY KIND OF WALKING THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL THAT THE STAFF IS EXPECTED TO WORK AS A TEAM WITHIN THIS OFFICE AND UNDER THE DIRECTION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING THE OFFICE ORGANIZED UNITS. IS AN EFFICIENT WAY TO PROVIDE STAFF SUPERVISION AND TO DIVIDE UP THE LABOR. NEXT QUESTION HOW DID THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINE THE STAFFING LEVEL GIVEN THE RISKS GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THIS OFFICE STATUS- I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH. WE ASSESSED WHAT THE DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WERE THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE OFFICE BASED ON THE STATUTE. TIME OPENINGS FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS OF THE AUTHORITY THAT THE STATUTE GRANTED- I THINK ALSO IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OTHER INITIATIVES IN EXPERTISE WITHIN. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT WE THINK WE CAN CALL UPON AND COLLABORATE WITH- AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE LARGER RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND POLICY DEVELOPMENT EXCEPT DRIVE. IN THE AREA OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. SO IN TERMS OF DO TO REVIEW AND JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT PLANS THE STATUTE OUTLINES SEVEN DESCRIPTIVE AREAS THAT THE COUNTY MUST REPORT ON. THE STATUTE NOTES THAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REVIEW AND ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED- WE DO BELIEVE THAT INITIALLY THIS PROCESS- PLAN REVIEW. AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS COMPLETE COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE LABORIOUS FOR OUR STAFF- BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT BEING AN ONGOING. ISSUE THIS STATUTE OUTLINES THAT WHILE THE PLANTS MUST BE UPDATED- OR MUST BE SUBMITTED ANNUALLY THEY REALLY ONLY HAVE TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY UPDATED EVERY THREE YEARS. WHICH THIS ALLOWS US TO KIND OF STAGGER OTHER PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE DONE RECOGNIZING THAT EVERY THIRD YEAR- OUR STAFF WILL BE BUSY. WORKING ON PLANTS- THE- I SEE ARE ALSO. HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE OVERALL JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM BY DEVELOPING BEST PRACTICES AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. SO BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT INCLUDING. SOME OF THE INITIATIVES UNDER WAY WITH OUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS- WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH- OUR RESEARCH UNIT AS WELL AS THE COUNTY COORDINATION UNIT IS WELL STAFF TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. SOME OF THE OTHER INITIATIVES GOING ON IN OUR DEPARTMENT. THAT WE SEE COLLABORATION WITH CERTAINLY WOULD BE WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE WORK THEY'RE DOING ON THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM AS WELL AS SYSTEM OF CARE REFORMS. AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SURGEON GENERAL WITH ASUS- AND IMPLEMENTING TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICES- THE- I SEE ARE ON PERSON. RESPONSIBLE WILL. ON PORTION OF THE JUSTICE. THAT WAS RE ACCOUNTING. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TWO TWENTY. THIS INCLUDES ALL YOU WITH THE SEVEN OF SEVEN B. OFFENSE. WHICH I WOULD JUST STATE FOR THIS- WHO MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT THAT IS THERE'S A FAIRLY SERIOUS. CRIMES AND DEAD. AND THEN YOU FOR CERTAIN SEX OFFENSES AS WELL AS YOU THROUGH STEP HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NEEDS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND AND STEP. THE O. Y. C. R. WILL FOCUS SERVICES ON THESE YOU BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE PLACED IN JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES. AND ARE OFTEN TIMES THE MOST IN NEED OF INTENSIVE TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING. BASED ON ALL THE ABOVE I CRITERIA AS THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES THAT THE- PERSONABLE WILL WORK WITH- THE NUMBER OF USED TO AT LEAST THE AND NUMBER OF USERS. WHO ARE RELYING TO TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY WE ESTIMATE THAT NUMBER TO BE ROUGHLY AROUND. AT ONE HUNDRED. NINETEEN HUNDRED. I THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY- THESE ARE USED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH NEEDS THE HIGH RISK OF- GRADUATE TO THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT- NEEDS AND SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON- THIS PARTICULAR POPULATION. I THINK THE LAST THING I WOULD STAY IN THIS AREA- IS THAT THIS OFFICE IS NEW AND I THINK IT WOULD BE REMISS TO SAY THAT WE SAT DOWN AND MATHIS OUT AND THOUGHT THAT THIS IS THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD OPERATE INDEFINITELY- WE BELIEVE IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO THAT AND RECOGNIZE THAT. WITH TIME THERE COULD BE CHANGES AND WE MAY NEED TO RESTRUCTURE AND ADAPT TO BE EFFECTIVE- NEXT QUESTION WHAT ARE THE TECHNICAL HUMAN SERVICES AND JUVENILE JUSTICE BACKGROUNDS EXPECTED OF THE STAFF. THE OFFICE WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF SEVEN- SORRY NINETEEN STAFF- AND WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE IN IT IN THESE AREAS JUVENILE JUSTICE HUMAN SERVICES HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. STAFF SKILL SETS RANGE FROM LEGAL EXPERTISE THE DATA EXPERTISE TO PROGRAM AND POLICY EXPERTISE- IN STATE SERVICE THE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WE SELECTED WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN. WORK WITH IN DEVELOPING DUTY STATEMENTS DURING RECRUITMENT- AND VARIOUS JOB DESCRIPTIONS TO INCLUDE THESE. AREAS OF EXPERTISE. WE WILL ALSO MOST CERTAINLY CONSULT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THAT THE CURRENT DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE AND OTHER EXPERTS INCLUDING THE MEMBERS OF R. O. Y. C. R. COMMITTEE OF THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL. TO GET THEIR THOUGHTS ON WHAT KINDS OF SKILLS- AND BACKGROUND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WHEN DEVELOPING DUTY STATEMENTS AND JOB DESCRIPTIONS. I DON'T AGAIN I THINK IT I WOULD ALSO THINK IT'S IT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE OFFICE IS. AND IS A VALUABLE FOR IT TO BE AN AGENCY pTECHNICAL EXPERTISE OF THE STAFF AND LEADERSHIP AND OUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING OUR DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT THREE HAVE THE- DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS. ETCETERA IN THIS PROPOSED A CAREER. ASSIGNMENT DESIGNATION X. ME- IS PROPOSED THE EXACT DIRECTOR. INSTEAD OF THE GOVERNOR'S APPOINTED POSITION SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION WHY IS A CAREER EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT POSITION PROPOSED FOR THIS POSITION AND I THEIR ACTIVITIES A TO SEE A DEAL. THAT APPOINTED APPOINTED POSITION CANNOT. THE- WHITE C. R. AS IN MY BEFORE REPORT TO THE UNDER SECRETARY WHO IN TURN REPORTS TO THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THE UNDERSECRETARY AND THE SECRETARY ARE CONFIRM POSITIONS MOREOVER THE HEAD OF A Y. C. R. WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ACT WITHOUT APPROVAL OF THE UNDERSECRETARY AND THE SECRETARY. IN STATE CLASSIFICATION A. C. A. LEVEL SEAT POSITION IS DESCRIBED AS SOMEONE WITH EXTENSIVE MANAGERIAL AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATIVE EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS INCLUDED WHICH HAS INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A COMBINATION OF MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. SUCH AS PROGRAM PLANNING POLICY FORMULATION ORGANIZATIONAL OF COORDINATION AND CONTROL AND FISCAL AND PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT WE FEEL THAT IS C. A. C. POSITION WILL PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF SKILL. EXPERTISE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT THAT'S NEEDED FOR THIS OFFICE TO BE. SUCCESSFUL SO GIVEN THESE AT THESE POINTS- ITS FEET MINISTRATIONS POSITION THAT THIS SHOULD. NOT BE A COMFORTABLE POSITION. DO YOU IN TO STAFFING TO MEET THE REST. IN FUTURE YEARS SB EIGHT TWO THREE. FOR EXAMPLE SB EIGHT TO THREE MINUTES ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANT ADMINISTRATION FUNCTIONS FROM THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS TO THE OCR. IN JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE DO NOT- WE HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS THIS WAS PART OF OUR ASSESSMENT. THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT GRANT PLANS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WILL NOT REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT- ANNUAL- STAFFING AND STAFF TIME- BY THE TIME WE HAVE REACHED TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND WE BELIEVE THAT AT SOME OF THIS STAFF IN PARTICULAR. CAN ABSORB THESE RESPONSIBILITIES. AND CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE DECISION TO PLACE THE ARMS BUT- ARMS BY THIS MAN'S GIVE ME IT'S AN AWKWARD. WORDING ALMOST PERSONS POSITIONS WITHIN A UNIT AS OPPOSED TO A SEPARATE UNIT- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE CONCEPT OF UNITS IS REALLY TO FACILITATE EFFECTIVE STAFF SUPERVISION. THIS OFFICE WILL FUNCTION AS A TEAM- AND EVERYBODY REPORTS TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ULTIMATELY THROUGH MANAGEMENT THE L. Y. C. R. ARMS FOR SOME RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE RECEIPT AB RECEDING REVEALING AND REFERRING COMPLAINTS FROM YOUTH AND FAMILY STAFF AND OTHERS. ABOUT HARMFUL CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING FACILITIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENTING AN EMERGENCY SITUATION THE- ICR HAS DETERMINED THAT IT CAN HELP RESOLVE THESE COMPLAINTS. A WE MADE A DETERMINED THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE. TO RESOLVE THESE COMPLAINTS THE COLLABORATION. AND TECHNICALS. WITH THE STILL EIGHT MINUTES AND STAFF. CERTAINLY THESE ROLES ALSO PROVIDE INCREDIBLE INSIGHT AS TO WHAT KIND OF TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND RESEARCH THE OFFICE SHOULD BE DOING THE OFFICE WILL ALSO PUBLISH AND PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS THE LEGISLATURE AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. AND OF COURSE IF THERE ARE COMPLAINTS WE WILL TAKE SEVERAL WE WILL- REFER THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE BODY TO REFUSE TO SEEK RESOLUTION. ALL THE OFFICES NINETEEN POSITIONS WELL WE HAD TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SOLELY DEDICATED TO THIS FUNCTION AS WELL AS HAVING ACCESS TO IN HOUSE COUNSEL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE SEE SEVERAL OF THE STAFF- BEING PARTIALLY DEDICATED TO DOING WORK THAT COMES OUT OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. THROUGH WHAT WE- ARE RESPONSIBLE IS BEING EXECUTED. IN THE ARMS OF ARMS PERSONS FOR ALL. FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY LAZINESS WILL ENGAGE WITH WITH LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS IF WE ARE HEARING THINGS. THAT ROLE THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IT LAST QUESTION- IF THE STAFFING IS SPLIT UP INTO REGIONS WITH THIS MAKE IT HARDER TO DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES PLEASE EXPLAIN- WITH THE TEAM THIS SIZE WE ACTUALLY SEE A LOT OF ENERGY AND INNOVATION THAT CAN COME FROM STAFF BECOMING EXPERTS IN OUR REGION OR WITH THE PARTICULAR. COMPLEX COUNTIES OR COUNTIES THAT HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES LIKE ALL BEING IN MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES AND I'M BRINGING THAT EXPERTISE IN CROSS FERTILIZING IT OF ACROSS REGIONS- AND IN IN MY EXPERIENCE- AND EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CAN SUCCESSFULLY CREATE THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE STAFF FOR SHARING WITH AND LEARNING. AND USING IT TO IMPROVE STRATEGIES AND PRODUCTS- AND OUTCOMES SO- WITH THAT BEING SAID I WILL. HEY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- PRECIADO- ALL THE WORK THAT YOU PUT INTO INTO THOSE- QUESTIONS I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE WHO YOU WILL BE- SERVING AND YOU MENTIONED- THAT YOUR FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON THE YOUTH THAT- EITHER THE ISSUES FOR WHICH- YOU KNOW THAT. THEY COMMITTED OR OF THEY HAVE A GREATER NEED- THEY BASICALLY YOUR- MORE MORE LIKELY OR MORE RISK- TO GO INTO ADULT OF INCARCERATION AND YOU SAID IT WAS ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED FIFTY USE- THE SYSTEM BEFORE THE- WASN'T SERVING. A. B. M. I'VE GOT THIS WRONG BUT LIKE SEVENTY FIVE SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND YOU WERE REFERRED TO PROBATION AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MAKE UP THE JUVENILE PROBATION POPULATION CLOSER- QUITE HUGE NUMBERS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE NEEDS OF THE REST OF THE JUVENILES. ARE YOU. YES VERY VERY GOOD QUESTION- FIRST TO CLARIFY I THINK WE CAN FOR- IS GOING TO BE THE NINETEEN SIXTY BASED ON OUR OUR ESTIMATES OF THOSE TWO PARTICULAR YEARS TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND TWENTY TWENTY- AND THAT I FOR OUR ARMS PERSONS- WILL OF RESPONSIBILITY I THINK IN TERMS OF POLICY DEVELOPMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUTH TO ENGAGE AND INTERACT WITH JUSTICE SYSTEM- THESE ARE USE THAT ARE ANYTHING FROM STATUS OFFENSES. TO MISDEMEANORS I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF USERS WHO ARE. ENGAGED IN THAT. YOU CAN OPERATIONS- AND OUR POLICY MOST SIR SHOULD I SPEAK TO. REACHING THOSE KIDS EFFECTIVELY WITH SERVICES- AND INTERVENTIONS SO THAT THEY THEY DON'T- FIVE. I WAS A GRADUATE TO THE ADULT SYSTEM BUT THEY ALSO JUST- ARE ARE SERVED AND SUPPORTED TO BE SUCCESSFUL- ADULTS AND- SO I DO SO I DO THINK THAT- SOME OF THE IMPORTANT GOALS OF ESTABLISHING THIS. OFFICE MOST CERTAINLY ESTABLISHING IT WITHIN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND AS I MENTIONED THE DEPUTY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT IN MY ROLE TO BE VERY INVOLVED IN THIS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN BEHAVIOR HEALTH POLICY IS REACHING AND ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE KIDS BEFORE THEY FALL DEEPER INTO THAT. YOU'RE NOT JUSTICE SYSTEM SO IT IT IS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING I HOPE THAT I CLARIFIED THAT. SOME OF THE ROLES OF THE- AROUND POLISH IDENTIFYING DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES WE'RE REALLY GOING TO LEVERAGE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT OUR OTHER. DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES ARE DOING LIKE I MENTIONED. YOU KNOW THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS BEEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS ADVOCATE FOR TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND SCREENING FOR TRAUMA IT'S REALLY KIND OF BRINGING TOGETHER LEADING TOGETHER THOSE VARIOUS DIFFERENT INITIATIVES IN ADDITION TO A CLEAR FOCUS ON JUVENILE JUSTICE IMPROVEMENTS. WITH THE OFFICE WHERE- I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT OVERALL. I'M A BETTER OF. OF JUVENILE JUSTICE SERVICES WHEREAS- THE ARMS PERSONS ROLE IN OF COURSE- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE PLANS BECAUSE THAT'S VERY. CLEAR AND SPECIFICALLY. OUTLINED IN THE- STATUTE IS REALLY SPECIFIC TO- A POPULATION THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NEEDS AND FRANKLY HAS. HAS COMMITTED MORE SERIOUS CRIMES. OKAY THIS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SYDNEY TENET PARTMINER FINANCE NOTICE ON COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU UNDER ALEJO. MOREOVER THE L. A. L. WE ARE NOT RAISE CONCERNS OF THIS PROPOSAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OKAY THANK YOU COLLEAGUES MANY QUESTIONS SENATE QUARTERS IN EUROPE FOR PROOF PRECIADO THE A VERY THOROUGH PRESENTATION- UNITED I THINK IT'S- ON DEFINITELY ON THE ONE HAND COMMENDABLE TO. REALLY TRY TO LEVERAGE I THINK IS A WORD USED- YOU KNOW SYNERGY AND OPPORTUNITIES- CROSS SYSTEMS IF YOU ACROSS UNITS THE ONE AREA THOUGH I'M STILL A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE WITH IN TERMS OF. IT STOPPING EXPECTATIONS. IS ON THIS ARMS PERSON AROUND SPOKESMAN ROLE IF I'M READING THE CHART RIGHT THERE'S TWO OF THOSE AND IF I HEARD THE- EFFECT PRESENTATION CORRECTLY. IS JUST SOUTH OF TWO THOUSAND. YOUTH POTENTIALLY THAT. COULD COULD- NEED TO BE MONITORED BY. BY THIS GROUP IT I'M JUST CONCERNED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S ENOUGH- MAYBE I'M SHELL SHOCKED TODAY BECAUSE OF. COMPLAINT DRIVEN PROCESS IS NOT LIVING UP TO WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT AND I JUST WANT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE DON'T. INADVERTENTLY WORKER JUST THROUGH. AMBITION HERE TO TRY TO GET A LOT DONE WITH TWO PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T END UP IN A POSITION WHERE. WE END UP LATER ON GETTING A REPORT FROM SOMEBODY SAYING WE HAD A LOT OF COMPLAINTS THAT DIDN'T GET RESOLVED OR- OR WITH A LOT OF PLANES COMPLAINTS WERE PEOPLE. NEVER REALLY GOT. WORD AS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD GO. FROM COULD YOU COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE AND AGAIN I'M- AT ONE OF CREATED A DEFENSIVENESS HERE. IN TERMS OF SOMEBODY TRYING TO DO SOMETHING VERY LEAN- IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE I THINK THIS GENERALLY GOOD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. SHORTCHANGING SHORTCHANGING YOU AS WELL THANK YOU. YES SO AS I MENTIONED- TO STAFF ARE SOLELY DEDICATED TO THAT PURPOSE BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT OTHER STAFF ARE NOT GOING TO BE WORKING ON THIS OF COURSE WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY- THE STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEVEL THREE WHICH IS IT IS A FAIRLY. HIGH LEVEL POSITION- WHO ALSO I COULD SEE MOST CERTAINLY PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN REALLY DETERMINING WHAT TO DO WITH THE COMPLAINTS- AND THAT FOR THAT PARTICULAR STAFF PERSON WILL LSO HAVE ACCESS TO OUR AGENCIES CHIEF COUNSEL- YOU KNOW MANY OF THESE COMPLAINTS WERE GOING TO NEED TO REFER TO OTHER PARTNERS AND ORDER HAD GEORGE JOINT JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES- WE HAVE WONDERFUL LESSONS THAT WE WANT TO LEARN FROM OUR OFFICE OF FOSTER CARE THE OFFICE OF THE FOSTER CARE HOMES BUT SPENT- AS YOU KNOW FOR THESE YOU THERE'S A LOT OF YOUTH WHO INVOLVED IN THOSE SYSTEMS. AND SO WANT TO LOOK INTO THAT AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN- WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM AS WELL AND I THINK THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE REALLY SEE THIS ROLE- AS A WAY TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER AND- AND THAT'S WHY THE COUNTY LIAISONS- WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AND ALSO I THINK PEOPLE WILL CERTAINLY- HAVE A PRETTY ACTIVE ROLE IN RESPONDING TO THINGS THAT WE LEARNED FROM FROM WHAT COMES THROUGH THE OFFICE PERSONS RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE- WE WANT TO USE A FRANKLY A CARROT TO CREATE CHANGE AND STUFF SO THAT MEANS WE NEED TO TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED WHAT WE HEAR. AND OF COURSE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT SERIOUS YOUNG PEOPLE HORRIBLE WE'RE GOING TO ACTION- BUT IF IT MEANS IF WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THE PROGRAMS NEED TO PRINT IMPROVE OR THEIR KIDS ENDING UP IN THE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SERVICES EARLIER THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO INGEST OF ADDRESS WITH OTHER STAFF TO BETTER POLICIES BETTER TRAINING YOU KNOW THEY CAN CONTACT ME AND WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH WHAT HAVE NOT AND SO I KNOW IT'S- IT LOOKS PAPER BECAUSE IT'S GOT THE TWO LITTLE. WITH THEIR NAY ON IT BUT IT'S REALLY THE WHOLE. WILL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. MMHM IT THANK YOU THAT. IN A- AGAIN I COMMEND YOU FOR. YOU'RE TRYING TO CREATE AS MUCH- NO EFFICIENCY IS POSSIBLE I GUESS THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD- BUT YOU KNOW IN YOUR- IN YOUR QUEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE POSITIONS ARE THERE ARE TWO- I DON'T SEE TROUBLE SHE WOULD MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER. AT ALMOST RATHER SEE THE INVESTMENT- IN IN MORE OF A SURVEY AND- I WANT TO SEE MENTORSHIP BECAUSE THAT'S A STRETCH BUT IT'S A ROLE AS OPPOSED TO A COMPLAINT DRIVEN ROLE IN IT I GUESS IN MY MIND SIGH- HAVING. YOU THOUGHT THERE WHO WERE NOT INCLINED TO CHECK IN WHO WITHOUT SOMEBODY CHECKING IN WITH THEM HAVING AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AN ENEMY SAY I APPRECIATE YOUR RELIANCE ON A GOOD COUNTIES THE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING A GOOD EFFORT BUT- THEY ALSO DON'T. REALLY HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF LEASE CURRENTLY OF SUPERVISION OUTSIDE OF INCARCERATION- AT A COUNTY LEVEL. OF OR ANY KIND OF MENTORSHIP IT'S GETTING BETTER I WOULD SAY EVEN IN A BIG COUNTY LIKE SANTA CLARA WHERE I COME FROM- THERE'S INCREASE EFFORTS TO. I TO CREATE THOSE KIND OF EXTERNAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS- BUT THEY REALLY DON'T FULLY EXIST IN. BLACK FACT THAT THEY DON'T EXIST TENDS TO LEAD TO- WITH SOME YOUTH- YOU'RE THE KIND OF RECIDIVISM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID SO- WHAT'S YOUR LET ME ASK YOU- WHAT YOUR FALLBACK POSITION IF TO ISN'T ENOUGH IN. YOU KNOW IMPROVING THE SYSTEM REALLY MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE. OF MORE MORE HANDS ON MORE EYES- MORE. A MORE COMMUNICATION WITH THESE YOU. SO I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE OFFICE ALSO HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT DATA- AND TO USE THAT DATA TO DRIVE POLICY WE ALSO COME BACK HERE AND SHARE THAT DATA WITH WITH ALL OF YOU WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD CALL IT SO MUCH OF THE BALL BACK- BENCH- OBVIOUSLY AN OPENNESS TO LEARNING WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND TO USE DATA. TO DRIVE THAT SO- AS I THINK THAT THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT AND THIS IS YOU KNOW AND THIS IS AN EXCITING AND IMPORTANT CHANGE BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT WE'RE LEARNING AND DAD. YOU KNOW AGAIN HAVE A COMMITMENT TO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. LAST QUESTION IN THIS REGARD IS. IF YOU WERE. BUDGETARY AUGMENTED SPECIFICALLY IN THE AREA WOULD YOU INCLINATION TO BE TO PUSH BACK ON THAT IT IS HAVING THE TWO SO COR AND TWO AND NO MORE. THAT IS SO CORE TO YOUR YOUR MODEL HERE THAT- YOU'RE NOT EVEN INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL FISCAL SUPPORT IN THAT AREA. I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION- WHAT I CAN SAY AGAIN IS I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE OFFICE IS DEDICATING TO PEOPLE TO THE SERVICE I THINK IT'S DEDICATING- MUCH OF THE WORK IT'S JUST NOT IT'S JUST NOT THE SOLE FOCUS OF THEIR WORK- AND SO I EAT YOU KNOW AGAIN. I REALLY THINK THAT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION AS WE REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AND WE HINK THIS IS A GOOD AS STRUCTURE AND AS WE THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING THE STATUTE HAS DIRECTED US TO ACCOMPLISH MORE WITH. WHAT WE PROPOSED DEAL. OKAY WELL THAT'S ALL I CAN DO IS ASKING INQUIRE AND- YOU KNOW STOP THEIR MANAGER WITH THE- FIFTY EIGHT AGAIN I MIGHT CONCERN IS TO BE. A WHO WAS TAKEN IN A HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE CONTEXT HERE IS. THIS SEEMS TO BE A GOOD THING FOR MY AGAIN FROM MY EXPERIENCE- IN. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I THINK COUNTIES WILL EMBRACE IT BY AND LARGE- GREAT JUST- HE TO CS SHORTCHANGE THE MODEL EARLY ON AND I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU. THE WOMAN THE COURT CHRISTIAN FOR THE CARE THIS IS ALLISON WHO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANTED TO JUST OFFER ONE THING I'VE TO SENATOR CORTESE'S COMMENTS- I WANTED TO. AS UNDERSCORE THAT SB EIGHTY THREE WHEN THAT JUVENILE REALIGNMENT I THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT ULTIMATELY- IS EFFECTUATED THE JUVENILE REALIGNMENT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS LAST YEAR CRIME THE BILL ACTUALLY INCLUDES APPROPRIATIONS TO COUNTIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE USE THAT WOULD BE REALIGNED UNDER THE BILL. AND IF YOU JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE IS THAT A GOAL OF PROVIDING RESOURCES TO COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. THAT ROBUST LEVEL OF SERVICES TO THE TO THE USE THAT WOULD BE REALIGNED. I'M TO THEM STARTING ON JULY FIRST. YOU I HOPE. I PRESHEAF THAT CLARIFICATION IN THE KELLY WOULD YOU SAY- I WOULD SAY YOU'RE PUTTING A LOT OF FAITH AND CONFIDENCE IN THE HR. DEPARTMENTS AND HIRING PROCESSES AT THE COUNTY TO GET THOSE FOLKS IN PLACE- IN TIME. IT IN AGAIN I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE HOW FAST YOU CAN YOU KNOW ON BOARD PEOPLE AND GET THEM- AGAIN HANDS ON EYES ON THE SITUATION BUT- I'M PROUD OF MY IT MIGHT COME HOME COUNTY BUT- YOUR- HE PROBABLY TO GET POSITIONS FILLED CURRENTLY EVEN PRE COATED IS A TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTH PROCESS- IT IN A WITH. BUT THE MONEY'S GREAT AND HOPEFULLY THEY CAN THEY CAN DO BETTER AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OUT THERE AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE UP TO. YOU KNOW TO A PRETTY. PRETTY QUICK. FAST PACED- ENVIRONMENT HERE. AS THIS GOES FORWARD I GUESS. BUT I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU YEAH. THANK YOU- I DO HAVE CONCERNS ALSO ABOUT THE- THE STAFFING LEVELS- ESPECIALLY AS I THINK THAT THEY ARE SET OUT IN SB EIGHT TO THREE- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- YOU'RE MAKING DECISIONS OR PROPOSALS BASED ON A MUCH SMALLER NUMBER OF YOUTH TO BE SERVED OTHER THAN WHAT I THINK IS LAID OUT IN SB EIGHT TO THREE SO I WOULD REALLY URGE AND COME BACK TO THE ISSUE OF HAVING- THE STAFFING THAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED- TO MAKE THIS WORK. AND ALSO DO WE WANT TO MAKE IT WORK RIGHT- WE CAN ALWAYS BUT WE DON'T NEED THAT MANY WE CAN ALWAYS ADDRESS THAT BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT WE START OUT WITH LESS THAN WHAT'S NEEDED- AND- SO I'D LIKE TO JUST PUT THAT OUT TO. A TO THE DEPARTMENT- AND- JUST ONE LAST I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THIS AND IF YOU HAVE A SHORT ANSWER TO THIS IS- THE POSITION THE EXECUTIVE POSITION- WHY AGAIN WOULD YOU. OPPOSE A SENATE CONFIRMED POSITION. THIS INDIVIDUAL WILL BE RECORDING- UP REPORTING DIRECTLY TO THE UNDER SCRETARY WHO REPORTS TO THE SECRETARY BOTH OF THOSE ARE CONFIRM POSITIONS- ALSO THERE ARE NO DECISIONS OF THAT PERSON WILL BE MAKING OUT WITHOUT THE APPROVAL AND- COORDINATION WITH ART ARE CONFIRM SECRETARY AND UNDERSECRETARY SAID THE ADMINISTRATION JUST NOT SEE A NEED TO. CONFIRM THIS POSITION. OKAY I THINK WE MAKE CONFIRMATIONS AND A LOT OF POSITIONS THAT. DON'T HAVE THE DECISION MAKING WE DO THAT ALL THE TIME WITH A- DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. AND POSITIONS SO- I WANT TO KEEP THAT ON THE ON THE TABLE AS WELL- I THINK THAT'S IT NO MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU WORK THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THAT YOU WERE HERE. BUT WE MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE FOR. OUR COUNTY PROBATION. AND- WHO WILL BE MAKING THE PRESENTATION GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I JUST NAY I MEAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF DEBT FREE REQUESTED SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT- FIRST PROPOSING A MODIFIED YOUR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THE STATUTORY FORMULA. FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PERFORMANCE ACTORS TWO THOUSAND NINE. WHICH PROVIDES FUNDS TO COUNTIES TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ON FELONY SUPERVISION WERE SENT TO STATE PRISON. I BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS PRIMARILY IF OF THE NINETEENTH AND THEN MAKING IT IMPACTS. YOU THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COMMUNITY STATE PRISONS WE ARE PROPOSING TO AMEND THE FORMULA. TO PROVIDE A SET AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED TWENTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND. WHICH IS A TEN POINT THREE MILLION INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. OBVIOUSLY NOT IS DERIVED FROM THE HIGHEST SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT AND IN EACH COUNTY OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. I WE NOTE THAT THIS IS INTENDED TO BE A TEMPORARY MEASURE. I IN ADDITION TO THE PANDEMIC OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS AB NINETEEN FIFTY WHICH REDUCED THE DURATION OF MOST PROBATION TERMS. ALSO AFFECTING EXISTING FORMULA. THESE FACTORS WILL REQUIRE FUTURE MODIFICATION OF THE CURRENT FORMULA MAINTAIN SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT FOUR ONE INCENTIVIZING THE WORK OF COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT. IN MINIMIZING. CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION. THE SECOND REQUEST IS FOR. FIFTY NINE GENERAL BY A ONE TIME TO SPUR COUNTY FOR. DEPARTMENTS IN. IT RE. AS THEY TAKE ON INCREASED WORKLOAD AND RESPONSIBILITIES I WE BELIEVE A. COUNTY PROBATION AGENCIES CAN BE PARAGONS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM EFFORTS. EIGHTY NINETEEN FIFTY AND SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE TREELINE JUVENILE OFFENDERS THE COUNTIES OF THEIR COMMITMENT BEGINNING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- IF THEY'RE PROVIDED THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO DO SO. THESE FUNDS ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE START UP FUNDING A. COUNTY SAID THAT PROBATION AGENCIES COMPLEXITY BASED PLANT SPEND. IN THE MANNER MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THE POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE COUNTIES MAY USE THESE FUNDS TO FRONT LOAD TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES. ARE MODIFIED JUVENILE FACILITIES THREE UNIQUE ENVIRONMENTS. PLAN AND DEVELOP REGIONAL APPROACH IS FOR SERVING YOU. AND TRAIN AND HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF FOSTER REHABILITATION AND. BEAST CASE THAT SIZE AND- FIND THE BUDGET TWELVE POINT NINE ONE MILLION GENERAL ONE TIME PROVIDED. SUPPORT COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT ON EXPEDITED RELEASES THERE POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION POPULATIONS RELEASED FROM STATE PRISON. BEGINNING IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY ICC ARE IMPLEMENTED A POLICY TO REACH CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS. SPECIFICALLY THOSE WITH A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS ORDER LAST DISORDER WE'RE NOT SERVING OUR STANDS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR VIOLENT CRIME. WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS SEX OFFENDERS YOU DO NOT POSSESS THEIR RISK ASSESSMENT SCORE THAT INDICATES A HIGH RISK FOR VIOLENCE. EARLY RELEASE REDUCE PRISON POPULATIONS AS A RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. I'M C. C. R. HAS ALSO EXPEDITED THE RELEASE OF OTHER INMATES INCLUDING THOSE CONSIDERED MEDICALLY HIGH RISK. ABSENCE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE OR TWENTY TWENTY EXCUSE ME AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION. YOUR EXECUTIVE ORDER AUGMENTATIONS AT THE DISASTER RESPONSE AGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. FOR THE NUMBER OF EARLY DAYS COUNTIES RECEIVE THESE INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOAD. OF THE TWELVE POINT ONE MILLION REQUESTED IS A PROJECTED AMOUNT YOU CAN YOU THESE EXPEDITED RELIEF EFFORTS. THREE THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE BUDGET YEAR UNTIL DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IF THE RELEASES ARE TERMINATED BEFORE ASKING ENDATE. COSTS ARE LOWER DUE TO OTHER FACTORS I WE INTEND TO RIVER ANY ACCESS FUNDING TO THE GENERAL FUND. I WITH THAT I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HELLO. THANK YOU MARIO THE AND OFF ALL THE ADDRESSING OF THESE SEPARATELY OF THE FIRST ISSUED ON THE SB SIX SEVENTY CRIMES MODIFICATIONS- WE NOTE ALL ALONG WITH WHAT THE LETTER SAID THESE POLICY CHANGES WILL BE HAPPY WE CAN ALSO CHANGES WILL BE IMPACTING THE SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT AWARDS WITHOUT SOME SORT OF MODIFICATION. AND GIVEN THIS WE THINK THAT IT JUST WENT TO THE S. B. SIX SEVEN EIGHT GRANT FORMULA IS APPROPRIATE IN THE NEAR TERM BECAUSE HE'S IMPACTS WOULD BE DUE TO REASONS. OUTSIDE THE CONTROL THE COUNTIES. I IN THE LONG TERM. WE THINK THAT IT IS FOR. WAS IT IN MAY PERMIT. THAT JUST MEANS WOULD UNDERMINE INTENT OF SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT. IS BECAUSE IT REMOVES INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THAT WAS CREATED BY SB SIX TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE RATE AT WHICH PEOPLE. ARE REVOKED BACK TO PRISON AS A RESULT OF FAILURE IN THE PROBATION SUPERVISION. EVEN IF WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE AUGMENTATION ON A ONE TIME BASIS AND RECOMMEND MINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A LONG TERM PLAN FOR SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT. PACIFIC WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT MULTICHANNEL LEGISLATION DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRIVATE LONG TERM PLAN FOR JUSTICE SB. SIX SEVEN EIGHT BY JANUARY TENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. GOING ON TO THE NEXT PROPOSAL ON THAT ONE TIME. AERATION GRANT AFFECTING MILLION DOLLARS. IT APPEARS TO BE PROBLEMS ON THE IDEA THAT COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S LACK SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH THE REALIGNMENT OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE DJJ. ANYTHING NINETEEN FIFTY WHICH IS A REDUCTION IN PROBATION TERMS. HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THIS IS THAT THE CASE. FOR EXAMPLE A LARGE PORTION THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL SEEMS TO BE INTENDED TO BE AT A SUPPLEMENT TO THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO SB. EIGHT TWENTY THREE BASED ON CONTACT USE OF DJJ. HOWEVER THE MANAGER DOES NOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE ANY INSUFFICIENT SEES IN THE LEVEL OF FUNDING OR THE ALLOCATION AND- THAT WAS INCLUDED. AS PART OF THIS NEW TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION AB NINETEEN. TRACKING D. FOR BASS DEPARTMENT WORKLOAD BY REDUCE THE AMOUNT PEOPLE ON. AS A RESULT AB NINETY FIFTH SHOULD ACTUALLY FREE UP PATIENCE WE- MOREOVER THE RULES A LOT AND YOU. AFTER THE TO ENSURE FUNDING FOR THESE PURPOSES. THE MINISTRY STATED THAT IT DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE USE OF THIS FUNDING IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED PASS PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE SIX SEVEN EIGHT. HOWEVER SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT REQUIRES OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM GO TOWARD EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND ALSO REQUIRE THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT'S REPORT ON THE USE OF THIS FUNDING. EVERFI THE LIKELY THAT THESE ACCOUNTABILITY BACK IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT EITHER CATHOLIC MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTED TO SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT SUCCESS. AND I SUGGEST I'M GONNA BY THE MINISTRATIONS IN THE SUCCESS OF SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT PROGRAM I'VE BEEN JUSTIFICATION FOR MEETING. ACCOUNTABILITY ON THIS PROPOSAL. INITIATION ALSO INDICATE IT SEEMS. THE REPORTED AS SIX SEVEN EIGHT B. H. ONE THREE WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THE PROPOSED FUNDING ISSUES. OUR THE PROPOSED MONEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT OR SB TWENTY THREE. AND THE MINISTRATIONSMADE IT CLEAR THAT THE FUNDING SEPARATE FROM THESE PROGRAMS MOREOVER THE REASON APARTMENT COULD USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES EACH FIT. I DID IT ON THAT THE REPORT. FOR THESE PROBLEMS WITH ANY BEARING ON THE- OF THE OF THE PRO. ON IS A LOT OF JUST. FOR BY THE MINISTRY FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND A LOT OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. GOING ON THE LAST PROPOSAL ON THE TWELVE POINT ONE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR PSEC TO SUPPORT CONFIRMATION WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELEASE OF. PRISON INMATES TO PRC HAS TO THE GOVERNMENT TEAM HAD DONE IT. WE FIND THAT THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OVER THE NON SUCH RELEASES THAT WOULD HER GOING BUDGET YOUR IS BECAUSE EACH YEAR AS WE MADE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN. KOBE NINETEEN MEDICATION EFFORTS INCLUDING BEGIN AGAIN. MISTER MAXINE'S TO INMATES. ONLY OVER THREE OF BRITS INMATES HAD AND OR RECEIVED BACK TO AT THIS. WHICH HE DOESN'T. MAY NOT BE AN TO CAN TO BE A ALL THE- WERE TORN. TO REDUCE THE- DOES AND SEE TO MINIMIZE THE CO NINETY. IN ADDITION WE KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FOR CDC ARE INCLUDES POPULATION HAS AN INTERESTING THE COCONUT TEAM RELATED ALTHOUGH HE SHOULD STOP BEFORE JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH IS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE A NEED FOR THE FUNDING FOR THESE ONLY RELEASES TO BE ROUTED THROUGH THE SEC TWO COUNTS. EITHER THAT OR IN HIS YARD IT USED TO BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD TO REFLECT LOW POPULATION I WOULD ARGUE. THAT CONTINUED OR AT LEAST. EVEN IF YOU RECOGNIZE HOLD ACTION THE PROPOSED UNTIL THE EVERY DAY. TIME WEEKS BECAUSE CLARITY ON A LACK. OF COVENANT THESE HERE CSK. INTO TWO TWENTIES TWENTY TWO. THANK YOU HAVE BEEN QUESTION TO HAVE. THANK YOU MR KRISHNA. OF OKAY. MADAM THIS IS JUST NAY TO WITH THEM SO I NEED THAT WOULD LIKE YOUR HANDS ON. IF I IT HARD AND- SORRY ABOUT THAT GO AHEAD MINISTRATION IS TO THAT PERFORMANCE INSTEAD COMPLY OF A SIX SEVENTY EIGHT WE DO HOWEVER WANT TO KNOW TO CONCERNED INCLUSION OF BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE TO COMMIT TO A SPECIFIC PLAN OR EVEN A TIMELINE OF A PLAN I'M ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE ONGOING PANDEMIC IN CERTAIN UNCERTAINTIES WITH PROBATION I'M COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT AND NECESSARY REVISIONS TO THE FORMULA BY IMPOSING INFLEXIBLE TIME ONE- THAT SAID WE'RE CONTINUALLY- HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE L. A. O. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND DEVELOPING A NEW FORMULA THAT. PRESERVES THOSE INCENTIVES IN- AS FAR AS THE L. A. RECOMMEND AND CRITICISMS ON B. FIFTY MILLION- IF THERE IS NO SPECIFIC NEED I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT RECENT SURVEY- OF INFORMATION THEY CAME THROUGH THAT PART OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. ABOUT THE ONE NINE POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND ONE TIME GRANT PROGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE I SEVERAL COUNTIES IN THAT- REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION INDICATED THAT. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING STE PARTICULAR ANY WALKING- INFRASTRUCTURE MODIFICATIONS TO REALIGN YOU. ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE NOTED THAT THEY NEEDED SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FIND ADEQUATE FACILITIES SERVICES AND PROGRAMS. I'M MARIN COUNTY NOTED THAT THEIR FACILITIES WERE OLDER AND THEY NEEDED ME THEY NEEDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. I TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT FACILITIES- AND I THINK MOST BLUNTLY KINGS COUNTY EXPRESSED THAT THE NINE POINT SIX MILLION WAS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE. TO COMPARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF JUVENILE. REALIGNMENT- AND WE THINK THERE IS STEVEN NEED FOR ANY DAY FIFTY NINE- TO HELP PROBATION DEPARTMENT DEAL WITH WORK BUT IT THE STATE EIGHT THREE- SB AS DAY. THEY NOTE STATE EIGHTEEN FIFTY IS GO TO REDUCE PROBATION- TERM LIMITS AND PRESUMABLY REDUCE CASELOADS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S LIKELY TO END IMPACT- INDIVIDUALS ON LONGER PROBATION TERMS WERE LESS LIKELY TO OUR FANS- INSISTENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE MOST LIKELY RECIDIVISM IS BERLINA PROBATIONERS TERM INCIDENT THESE FUNDS ARE ARE MORE AND MORE INTENSE FRONT LOADING SERVICES RATHER THAN FINDING A DRESS IN THE BACK AND THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT COME EARLIER OFF THOSE PROBATION TERMS. AS BASIC KIND OF FACE TO FACE THOSE IN AN INDOOR THE STATE ON PROBATION TERMS SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COUNTIES NOW IT POPULATIONS CAN BE SIR- RIGHT WHEN THEY BEGIN THEIR PROBATION TERM SO THAT BY THE TIME THEY'RE OFF THOSE SHORTENEDSENTENCES THE RATE SET UP FOR SUCCESS- AS FAR AS THE LACK OF THE PLANNER METHODOLOGY WE'VE- WORKED OUT OF A CASE THAT BASED ON THAT PASSED FIVE YEARS OF COUNTY LEVEL DATA FOR THEIR- ORDER. PORTANTINO PROBATION POPULATIONS AND THE NUMBER OF JUVENILE COMMITMENTS- WELL MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE WITH MEMBERS OF THE STAFF BEARING ANYBODY ELSE WHO'S INTERESTED KIND OF ALLOCATION WE'VE ESTABLISHED- AND IT KIND OF IS A CONSIDERATION OF HISTORICAL WORKLOADS. BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT THAT FUNDS SHOULD BE USED FLEXIBLY BY COUNTY PROBATION- AGENCIES INDIVIDUALLY AS THEY HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS. FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL POPULATION. LASTLY THE A. O. THAT THERE IS A LACK OF- YOU JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT IT MAY. SUPPORTS ENTRANCE. I'M WEEK LOOKS TO WERE WITH OTHER. ON AGAIN TO MATCH TO PROMOTE MUSIC. I DO WANT HIGHLIGHT COUNTIES ALREADY SUBMITTING. AMOUNTS OF DATA TO BE A EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. I'M SPECIFICALLY IF YOU AB IS INCLUDED AS PART OF S. B. EIGHT TWENTY THREE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL BE WORKING ON REPLACEMENT OF A JUVENILE COURT PROBATION STATISTICAL TO THE SYSTEM- POINT JCPS S. ODD BECAUSE OFFICE IF YOU CAN COMMITTEE RESTORATION IS. ALSO TASKED WITH PROVIDING REPORTS ON YOUTH OUTCOMES IN THE JUVENILE SYSTEM. AND THE EXISTING FRAMEWORK OF SB SIX SYDNEY ALREADY REQUIRES COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO REPORT. INFORMATION ON THE USE OF. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES INFORMATION OR OUTCOMES WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ANNUALLY- IN THOSE FINDINGS AND REPORTS ARE PUBLISHED ANNUALLY- AND PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE. ASK WHEN IT COMES BE POINT MILLION FUND. AND GIVE ME A- DOESN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE DIFFERENCES WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR POPULATION ESTIMATES- CCR HAD PROVIDED EARLIER ASKED ME IT SEEMED. DAY EXPEDITED RELEASES WOULD AND JUNE THIRTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHERE'S- THE ADMINISTRATION FINANCE. ASSEMBLY KIND OF LATER DATE WHEN WE WERE DOING OUR EXPECTATIONS A LITTLE LATER ON THAT DAY WAS EXPEDITED RELEASES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO AGAIN WE DO WANT TO NOTE THAT IT LOOKED KIND OF. DEFEATED DIFFERENCES IN POINT KIND ESTIMATES AND THAT WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REVISIT IN THE MAY REVISION ON THE KIND OF HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF NEED. I'M WEARING A PANDEMIC MIGHT BE AT THE TIME BUT WE JUST THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL BUDGET RESOURCES AND THE GENERAL FUND. TO PAY FOR THIS- EXPEDITED. RELEASES THEIR NEXT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MUCH. I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. RAND THE REPORTING THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS- OR ARE THERE PROVISIONS FOR REPORTING- AFTER THE COUNTIES USE THE FUNDING. AND HOW WILL THE- ALLOCATIONS BE DETERMINED TO THE COUNTIES. ONE THING I EXCELLENT QUESTION RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL- HOWEVER WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC- WHEN IT COMES TO THE ALLOCATIONS- AGAIN IT'S BASED ON KIND OF IT AND HISTORICAL WORKLOAD OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS SPLIT. BETWEEN COUNTY HISTORICAL SUBMISSIONS IT DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FOR THEIR JUVENILE OFFENDERS AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTY PROBATION POPULATIONS THAT WERE KIND OF ADDRESSING HISTORICAL NEED- FOR THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH. BOTH ADULT PROBATIONERS AND YOU'VE BEEN OUT MAINTENANCE TO ADDRESS PRIMARILY SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTY ITS POTENTIAL. FUTURE WORK WILL IMPACT. THE L. DID YOU. HOW WILL THE ALLOCATIONS BE DETERMINED WE HAVE- SET UP AD BY COUNTY ALLOCATION AND AGAIN I CAN PROVIDE THAT IT OKAY STAFF AS WELL. OKAY ON THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS THUNDER. NO THANK OR DOESN'T KNOW. QUICK QUESTION AND YES THEN IT IS I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW IN TERMS OF RESPONSES BACK FROM COUNTIES REGARDING OF FACILITIES NEEDS WHICH I KNOW EXIST OF THAT SO. A PRETTY PLAIN TO SEE OBVIOUS SITUATION. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN- ANY EMPHASIS ON FACILITIES NEEDS FOR PURPOSES OF- TREATING THE CDA POPULATION THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL DAY LONG AND THEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- IN A DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAN- FOLKS WITHOUT THOSE ISSUES INMATES WITHOUT THOSE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING. SENT ON TO THE COUNTIES. I'M JUST ASKING IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S AN ONGOING DISCUSSION OR NOT. I BELIEVE THAT IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AGAIN. EXCELLENT QUESTION SENATOR CASEY WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR AT THIS POINT. THIS IS A FIX ON EIGHTY EIGHT FACILITY NEEDS HOWEVER COUNTIES ARE WORKING WITH THAT NINE POINT SIX BILLION ARE PROVIDED THROUGH SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE ON KIND OF FACILITY GRANT PROGRAMS ON THOSE FUNDS WERE ALSO INTENDED TO SUPPORT AND A REGIONALIZATION. SO THAT SOME COUNTIES WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE A NEED FOR ADA COMPLIANT FACILITIES- DEPENDING ON OUR POPULATIONS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHER- NEIGHBORING COUNTIES TO KIND OF ESTABLISH FACILITIES THAT SUPPORT MORE REGIONALIZED- EFFORTS. FOR THOSE PURPOSES AND OTHERS. YEAH I DO REMEMBER COLD. ASPECT OF IT THE YOU- IT JUST I GUESS- AGAIN PUT A PLACE HOLDER OUT THERE SO TO SPEAK ON THE POLICY SIDE THAT- YOU KNOW THE BUCKET. THIS THERE ARE OF FOR THOSE GRANTS FOR THAT PURPOSE FOR FACILITIES PURPOSES IS. A POTENTIALLY GONNA NEED TO BE EXPANDED TO. TO DEAL WITH. AGAIN WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WE KNOW IS THERE AS WE RETURNED. AS A RETURN FOLKS BACK TO THE COUNTIES- IT IN WE REFLECT ON. THE STATE'S OWN CHALLENGES- THE ARMSTRONG AND WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER- WITH THE SIGNIFICANT- PDA POPULATION AND MUCH OF THAT BEING OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR ILLNESS THAT THE COUNTY'S RT QUIPPED EITHER TO. ADD YOU KNOW WITH BEDS OR TO HOUSE OF. THEN PERHAPS THE STATE IS AT THIS TIME SO IT THINK IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO BE LOOKED AT WHETHER THAT'S- ON THE LEGISLATIVE SIDE- WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE I DON'T KNOW BUT- I'M SURE THE PRESENTERS WOULD AGREE THAT ALTHOUGH IT. THIS BUCKET THAT'S BEEN CREATED- IS A GOOD INITIAL START FOR PURPOSE ELISE MEANS- IT'S PROBABLY GONNA FOLDERS SHORT. BUT THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE REPORT. THE L. A. O. ANY RESPONSE. YES ONE FINAL BIT OF CLARIFICATION ON A COUPLE OF THAT PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS SO ON THAT SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT RECOMMENDATION FOR THE BUDGET TRAILER SITUATION HARD TIMES NOT WITH THAT PLAN THAT. THERE WOULD BE REQUIRED BY JANUARY TENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO LAY OUT A NEW FORMULA FOR THE SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT AMOUNTS BUT TO SET UP A PLAN FOR ADJUSTING NOT FORMALLY GOING FOR ABOUT A TO KEEP. IT ALIVE. ON ON GOING BASIS AS FOR. ONE BRAND. I WONDER TO COME A FEW THINGS FIRST ADDITION THAT AND I ONE- SIX MILLION IN THE COMING THAT'S FOR BY FOR THE REAL LINE. THE NOT ALL BE IN AWE GRAND THAT'S- YEAH DOLLARS FOR SIX POINT FIVE AND IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND TO EIGHTY MILLION. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE WITH PROCESS ESTABLISH HERE CONTINUE TO ADJUST GOING. IN ADDITION REGARDING THE SERVER THAT FOUND APART OF MINE IS MENTION. WATER STILL HE'S DID EXPRESS OVER LOCAL PHONE MANY OF COUNTY ROUGHLY HOW OF THEM. EXPRESS WE'RE NOT INTENDED TO APPLY FOR THAT POINT SIX MILLION SO IT. WITHOUT SOME KIND OF MADE WOULD NEED TO FUNDING IT'S NOT CLEAR. WHEN I START THAT- TOTAL NOW OF FUNDING THAT'S BEFORE. IS AMOUNT. OKAY THANK YOU. THAT IS CORRECT- EIGHT EIGHT I WOULD SUS IN IN SOME COUNTIES AND I'M NOT SO THAT THE ENTIRE ANSWER THEIR BUT THAT THAT IN SOME COUNTIES THERE'S A MOVE AWAY FROM INCARCERATION IN GENERAL AND SO THE NOTION OF BUILDING MORE FACILITIES ARE IMPROVED MORE FACILITIES GOES CONTRA TO THEIR FOUGHT CURRENT PHILOSOPHY OR IDEOLOGY- ABOUT. A DIVERSION AND IN IN USING OTHER PROGRAMS OTHER THAN INCARCERATION BUT IT DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH FACILITIES WHICH WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY THE FACILITIES PROHIBIT THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO MAKE- RELEASE OF FOLKS WHO DON'T NEED THAT HELP WE DON'T NEED THE FACILITIES FOR INCARCERATION BUT WE DO NEED. FACILITIES FOR A MENTAL HEALTH AND I JUST SUGGEST DALY- MAYBE. THAT QUESTION. HI BEEN ASKED HIM THAT WAY- IF YOU ARE TAKING THIS TIME POINT SIX YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IT- OR ANY ONGOING MONEY FOR FACILITIES. FOR CORPORATION PURPOSES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED. IN IN A SIMILAR BUCKET OF MONEY FOR. OF MENTAL HEALTH PLACEMENT OF. THAT PERCENTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT REQUIRE THAT IN IF THAT'S BEEN ASKED. WONDERFUL IF IT HASN'T I'M JUST SUGGESTING IT'S A QUESTION THAT NEEDS TO BE ANSWERED. GREAT FOLLOW UP ON THAT- IT'S I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS ISSUE THANK YOU ALL VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK. OKAY MOVING ON TO ISSUE FIVE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL HAVE A PRESENTATION THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US OF WHO IS GOING TO BE MAKING THE PRESENTATION. I'M SURE RYAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WELL MISTER RANDALL.

I THANK MILLION SIX SEVEN. RELATED APPLICATION OF THE IF YOU HAVE- THE POLICE CHIEF FORCE STUFF. OF THIS REASON WE FIND SPEND MUCH OF OUR TIME- AND THOSE RELATED THE INFLUENCE OF YES SIX- FOR MORE THAN TO COVER ANY OF THE BILLS. MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT THERE WAS A LETTER THAT HE DECIDED YOU THE SERVICE THAT YOU THE AUTHOR. BACK IN JANUARY AND- JANUARY TWENTY SIXTH CONTENT LEYVA OUR REGIONAL ESTIMATES OF WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NEEDED EMPLOYMENT AB FIFTY HAS SIX- SUPPORTING ME THE EXPECTATIONS AND THE REQUIREMENTS. SPECIFIED. IN THE BILL THAT WAS SIGNED. SO THIS MILLION- WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LETTER OUTLINE HIS INITIAL INVESTMENT I DON'T WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR- BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET US THE POINT- THAT WAS EXPECTED IN THE LEGISLATION- THE MODEL IS BASED THAT ARE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE IS BASED ON FORTY CASES PER YEAR. AND INSTEAD AND THAT'S WHAT OUR ESTIMATE WOULD ADDRESS A FIVE TWENTY SIX MILLION THEN WHEN THE POLICE PRACTICES PROVISIONS IMPLEMENTED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THAT- SO WE HAVE- BOTH AVAILABLE TODAY I HAVE JOHN MARSH WITH THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT R. ONE PORTION OF THE VISION AND I DON'T WORK THERE WITH YOU NOW WE ALSO HAVE LANCE PLAYERS HE FAR FROM HIM WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES AND THE RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE CREDIT. AS A MATTER. OF FACT YOU QUESTION. OKAY DO WE HAVE. DELEO OR MR I'M SORRY PUT THEIR HAND UP FIRST. OKAY THE L. A. O. HAVE ANY DALY WITH THE L. A. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. OKAY THE OTHER HAND MISTER WEBER. GOOD AFTERNOON AND WEBER-DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST ONE COMMENT COUNT ON THE END OF THAT COMPANIES RAN WEEKLY THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALLOWS DOJ TO ESTABLISH THIS INVESTIGATIVE TEAM THE PROGRAM COLLECT DATA AND WORKLOADS MIRACLES IN THE FUTURE IF I JUST RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AT THIS TIME IS A BRAND NEW PROGRAM THERE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES. AS HE MENTIONED THE WE ESTIMATE ABOUT FORTY CASES YEAR BUT WHO KNOWS REALLY GONNA HAPPEN AND ALSO A LOT OF THIS IS A LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE THE DOJ HAS SO WE COULD RAMP UP OR THE BUDGET THE DIRECT FUNDING FROM YEAR ONE TO YEAR TILL AND IF THEY WERE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AS THESE TEAMS ARE COMMITTED AND WILL BE MODERATED JUST RESTORE NEEDS ARE NEEDED. IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT AT THIS BILL REQUIRES PLEASE PRACTICE VISION TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THE PROJECT IS WHAT'S COME BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS REQUEST FUNDING FOR THAT TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS AND AT THAT TIME TO RE EVALUATE THE PROGRESS. OF THESE VESTED. THANK YOU MUCH. I HAVE A- QUESTION. IF IT THE- SOMEONE COULD. DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. HOW AB FIFTEEN OH SIX CHANGES THE WAY THAT THE DOJ. HANDLED THESE CASES HOW WILL THE DOJ. A DEPLOY YOUR RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL. AND CHAIRMAN OF THE JOHN MARSH FOR MARKETERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HE CAN SPEAK TO HOW THOSE RESOURCES WILL ROLL OUT- OKAY. MISTER MARSH. I'M SURE SO- DIFFICULTY WITH THIS PROGRAM IS- THE PHARMACIST CURRENTLY DOESN'T DO THIS TYPE OF WORK- WE DON'T HAVE THE INVESTIGATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK- WE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE NEW STAFF AND WE HAVE A TRADING COMPONENT IS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO GET- HE'S FLYING- TRAINING FOR THE AGENTS TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK AND A PROBLEM- THAT WE'RE WE'RE SEEING- WITH ONLY GIVEN US PORTION OF THE FUNDING IS. I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET STRUCTURE ALREADY WITHIN CAL B. O. THEN STARTING IT YES PART OF IT IS- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGENTS BUT THERE'S SO MUCH A QUICK MINUTE INFRASTRUCTURE WE JUST DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK IN THIS WORK IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR I MEAN THESE ARE THE MOST COMPLEX SERIOUS CAES THAT BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN HANDLE. AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WERE SET UP TO SET UP FOR SUCCESS AND SET UP TO HANDLE THESE CASES APPROPRIATELY IT'S NOT SOMETHING. THAT WE CAN- LIMBANG TO AND STAR WITH HOW OF THE FUNDING THAT WE NEED OR HOUSE THE RESOURCES- THERE'S- WE BUCK- HOLD. A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DIDN'T WITH- LAW ENFORCEMENT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM TO. TO HELP TRAIN US- WE HAVE TO COLLABORATE. THE RESOURCES THEY WERE ASKING FOR ARE GOING TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO OTHER STATE DOES- INVESTIGATIONS FROM BEGINNING TO END OF AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING- YOU START YOUR FRIENDS LIKE SERVICES TO COLLECT EVIDENCE. AGENTS DOING INVESTIGATIONS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ATTORNEYS PROSECUTING THE CASES SO. THIS TYPE OF. WORK IS LITERALLY START TO FINISH AND- EVEN IN. THE COMING UP WITH THE NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING HAVING EVEN LOOKING AT THE BUDGET THE LEGISLATION WE'RE GONNA HAVE DIFFICULTIES FINDING WHAT CASES ARE THAT WE'RE GONNA HANDLE ARE NOT HANDLE- IF THE GUNS LOADED OR UNLOADED- WE HANDLE A CASE OR NOT HANDLE THE CASE- SO WE'RE TRYING TO EVEN WORK THROUGH- THE LEGISLATION WHICH DOESN'T MATCH CALIFORNIA. PENAL CODE LAWS SO OUR ESTIMATE OF FORTY CASES IS A ROUGH ESTIMATE WE GATHER THAT DATA FROM DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN COLLECTING TO MAYBE SEVENTY ONE- AND WE'VE WE'VE GONE BACK TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS- WHICH IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY YEAR AND WE'VE DETERMINED THROUGH THAT- ABOUT TWENTY OF THOSE HUNDRED FORTY YEAR ON ARMS. ANOTHER NINE A REPLICA FIREARMS AND THEN ELEVEN WOULD BE- NOT CLASSIFIED AS DEADLY WEAPNS SO WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT- THEY IMPLEMENTED A STATEWIDE- PROGRAM IS DIFFICULT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE STATEWIDE AGENCY BUT THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO- DESIGNATE TOWARDS THIS PROGRAM IS A MESS SO WE'VE DETERMINED THAT ABOUT 60% OF THESE CASES HAPPEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE GONNA SHIFT- SOME MORE RESOURCES TOWARDS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AT THE HELP. HANDLE THOSE TYPES THE CASE BUT WHICH HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE RESPOND ANYWHERE. IN THE STATE HELP NOT SO MORE AND BORDER AND- WHAT THE MOUNT PERSONNEL IT'S- GONNA BE DIFFICULT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- SHAPE THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT YOU'RE PUTTING INTO IT AHEAD OF TIME SO TAT WE CAN BE AS SOME. AND ONCE THE USE THE TERM SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT WE COULD BE AS THE DO THE WORK AS WELL AS WE CAN SO. EIGHT THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATORS. OKAY. I THINK THAT'S IT ANY OTHER. COMMENTS BY ANYBODY. NO OKAY THANK YOU MISTER RYAN AND- EVERYBODY BUT WE'RE MOVING ON TO ISSUE SIX OUR BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES. JERRY THIS IS CHRIS RYAN OF THE FALCONS OF JUSTICE AGAIN. AND- THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A FEW YEARS IT IS WITH THE NETWORK ISSUE. YOUR BROTHER SERVICE PROPOSAL THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO A BACK ROOM HERE TODAY- IT WAS THIS MORNING ARE YOU HEARING IMPAIRED FINANCE THAT DESCRIBE THE FINE HE- HE SHE THAT WOULD SENIOR PROSTATE AND FRIENDLY EVER SINCE THE LAST SERVICES. YEAH HE FIRED- IS A FIND THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT PASSED YEARS. HAVE WITHIN. AFTER I CAN SPEAK TO VERY SMALL. WEAKENS EVERY. ON BEHALF OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AS IT RELATES TO THE PROPOSED- THE SIX NATIONALLY AND THE LACK OF. THE CRAP OUT OF PROPOSAL WELL UNTIL AND- ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OF LATE BECAUSE OF THESE COUPLE LINES. OKAY ALL RIGHT THE MISLI L. A. O. WHAT THE L. A. L. WE HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU ON THIS ITEM- FIRST WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE PROPOSED BACKFILL BUT ONLY FOR TWO YEARS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT REVENUES AND THE FINGERPRINT FEES ACCOUNT- WHICH IS AN ACCOUNT THAT WILL BE USED TO BACK FILL A PORTION OF DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING SHIFTED OVER TO THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES- AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE EVENUES THAT HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO THIS ACCOUNT- HAS BEEN LOWER. AS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THE FINE COULD BECOME INSOLVENT IN A COUPLE YEARS OF THE REVENUES DON'T INCREASE AND SO BY APPROVING IT ONLY FOR TWO YEARS IT IT IT HELPS ENSURE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT FUNDS AND THAT SPECIAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE BUREAU WITH SUFFICIENT FUNDING WALL OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK- ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. SOURCE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENTED NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK BY REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU BEGINNING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT THAT CERTAIN LOCAL AGENCIES ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING FROM THE BUREAU PROVIDING SERVICES AT NO CHARGE TO AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES IN ABOUT FORTY SIX COUNTIES. AND THE REQUIRING LOCAL AGENCIES CONTRIBUTE A PORTION- FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE WILL ALSO PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO PRIORITIZE THE WORKLOAD THAT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO DOJ IT WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE NEED FOR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS HERE TO HELP WITH THIS FUNDING FRAMEWORK WE RECOMMEND THE EGISLATURE REQUIRE DOJ DEVELOP AND REPORT ON A PLAN NO LATER THAN OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR CALCULATING EACH LOCAL AGENCIES SHARE BASED ON THE SERVICES IT'S USING. SO THIS PROVIDES DOJ WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THE SPECIFICS OF THE NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK SUCH AS WHETHER YOU KNOW THE AGENCY SHARE WILL DIFFER BASED ON THE TYPE OF FORENSIC SERVICE THAT'S BEING REQUESTED THE SPEED OF THE SERVICE OR THE SIZE OF THE AGENCY. OUR FOURTH AND FINAL RECOMMENDATION IS IN LIGHT OF THIS NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING WE DO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTED THE PROPOSED NEW FACILITY UNTIL IT IS IMPLEMENTED. AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK WHICH INCENTIVIZE LOCAL AGENCIES TO FIND THEIR CAUGHT THEIR LAB SERVICES AND OBTAIN THEM IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. POSSIBLE WHICH COULD IMPACT THE WORK WITH BEING SENT TO DOJ AND SAID TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE WORKLOAD IN THE ORGANIZATION OF THE GIRLFRIEND'S EX SERVICES CHANGES IT COULD CHANGE THE NEED FOR THE PROPOSED FACILITY. SO THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR. OKAY NOBODY ELSE NOBODY ELSE OKAY. I'M SORRY. OF ONE. SORRY MR WHATEVER YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS UP AND I KEEP IGNORING YOU. K. RESPONSE SEVENTY BE AGAINST YOU EITHER DON'T FEEL. ABOUT THE ACTUALLY THE BACKFILL SO AS WE TRAVERSED NAME IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAD EARLIER THIS MORNING WITH RESTITUTION FINES IN THAT THE UNITED STATES FUND. I REFUSE BEEN GOING DOWN LAST YEAR'S WE HAD TO DO GENERAL FUND BACKS BILLS. ANALYSTS NOTE THAT ADD THIS BACK ON SOME OF THE REST YO CAN FIND IT WILL BE ADJUSTED EACH YEAR TO THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS BASED ON ACTUAL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES. ONE OTHER NOTE- ON THE RECOMMENDATION MANY OTHERS HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERSONALLY SUPPORTS AND THE BFS. WE DO A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED BECAUSE THEY COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SMALLER COUNTIES TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PAINS STATE FOR SERVICES. AND WE'RE A LITTLE WORRIED THAT IT COULD INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO PRIORITIZE MISSION EVIDENCE THEY CANCELED BECAUSE- YOUR- I AGREE WITH YOU ON ON THAT LEVEL LAST ONE- ESPECIALES KIND OF SERVICES ARE SO IMPORTANT CAN I ASK YOU OR ANYONE. OTHER THAN THE COUNTY. WHAT OTHER ENTITY COULD POSSIBLY BE TAPPED TO PARTIALLY PAY FOR THE SERVICES I THINK WE HAVE A OPINION ON THE. MILLER MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT I THINK WAS ALL HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING THE RAISE YOUR HAND FUTURE. IT IS A LITTLE OLD SCHOOL. OKAY YEAH YES GO AHEAD MR MILLER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- WITH THE QUESTION BEING OTHER THAN- THE COUNTY BEING A SOURCE OF INCOME THEY'RE ACTUALLY BUT A LOT OF STUDIES- THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND INTERNATIONALLY REGARDING WHERE THESE BONDS CAN COME FROM AND THOSE STUDIES HAVE INCLUDED THINGS LIKE THE ONLY- RECOMMENDED YOU FOR SERVICE A COST SHARING. AND THOSE LONG BEEN REJECTED BY VARIOUS STATE TEXAS IDAHO JUST MENTION A COUPLE- AND THE ONES THAT HAVE- TRYING TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT ACTUALLY FIND THAT THEY HAVE A VERY LARGE COLLECTION POOL SUCH AS MISSISSIPPI WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY THAT IS- NO. NO LONGER BEING PAID TO THE STATE EVEN THOUGH IT DOES SET OUT THERE AS- SOMETHING THAT THEY NEED TO COLLECT FROM THE COUNTY AND IT IS- MISTER RYAN ALLUDED TO. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL DIFFERENT AVENUES BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND IS THAT THE GENERAL FUND BACKFILL IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR BECAUSE THERE IS THAT SAME CONCERN ABOUT SMALLER COUNTIES AND SMALLER POPULATIONS ABILITY TO PAY% GETTING. EQUAL ACCESS TO THAT JUST. MMHM THANK ANYONE GIVE ME A IT OF WHAT THE ACTUAL CONCRETE IMPACT WOULD BE- IN A COMMUNITY. IF THEY COULD IF THEY COULD NOT- IF THEY COULD NOT OR WOULD NOT- PAY INTO- PAY FOR THESE COSTS. I'M SURE VERY MILLER AGAIN- THE I THINK WE ACTUALLY HAVE EXAMPLES OF THIS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT WHEN WE DID OUR RESEARCH FOR AN ASSESSMENT THAT I PROVIDED TO THE LEGISLATURE. HE ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS ACTUALLY A POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT DOES HAVE A FEE FOR SERVICE. MODEL WITH THEIR LOCAL AGENCIES AND WE FOUND THAT THERE WERE MANY SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS THAT HAD NOT BEEN TURNED IN OR ANALYZED BECAUSE THE LOCAL AGENCY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN AFFORD. THE SERVICE AND SO WE DO SEE THAT. AS A POSSIBILITY THAT THOSE TYPES OF EVIDENCE COULD BE EITHER NOT TURNED IN BASED ON AN AGENCY MAKING FUNDING DECISIONS. THAT DON'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT BEST EVIDENCE. OR THEY DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKETHE TIME TO INVESTIGATE A CRIME THAT COULD LEAD TO THE SOLVING OF OTHER CRIMES IN A DATABASE THAT ARE UP. BECAUSE THEY CHOSE NOT STERN. MMHM OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF. C. I HEARD- LOOK AT THE OTHER OPTIONS OKAY. THE CAMPUS CONSOLIDATION. COULD SOMEONE SPEAK TO THAT AND EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE WITH THE TIME LINE WOULD BE AND- AND THE IMPACT ON ON ON RICHMOND. YEAH MILLER MEDICARE. MR MILLER SAYS I'M SURE VERY MILLER AGAIN. SO THE CONSOLIDATION OF WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS THAT IS BEING WORKED ON SENSE. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND TWO- THE RICHMOND FACILITY WHEN DNA STARTED TO BECOME. MORE AND MORE INTEGRATED INTO GRANTS SIX. WAS LOCATED IN BERKELEY AND THEY WERE MOVED TO THE RICHMOND FACILITY WHILE WE WERE PLANNING A LARGE SCALE CAMPUS IN SACRAMENTO TO HOUSE ALL OF THE DNA AND LOCAL SACRAMENTO ACTIVITIES INCLUDING B. SACRAMENTO REGIONAL CRIME LAB THE CALIFORNIA CRIMINALISTICS INSTITUTE. THE CURRENT DNA DATA BANK IN RICHMOND AS WELL AS ALL OF THE IN A CASE WORKING CRIME SCENE RESPONSE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE IN THAT AREA. WE ALSO CENTRALIZED TALKS APOLOGY WHICH IS THE DRUG TOXICOLOGY UNIT IN SACRAMENTO BADS PROVIDE SERVICE FOR ALL OF THE COUNTIES THAT WE SERVE. WE ALSO HAVE A HEADQUARTERS UNIT- WHICH I'M A PART OF IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TOGETHER IN THIS CONSOLIDATED FACILITY IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH SOME OF OUR STATE PARTNERS BEING UC'S AND THE ISSUES RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A GOOD. CANDIDATES AND INTERNS THAT WE CAN RUN THROUGH THE PROGRAM SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WORKING WITH THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO. WORK IN COLLABORATION TO GET THAT ROLLING. AS FAR AS THE AFFECT ON RICH. B. RICHMOND STAFF- MANY OF THEM DON'T ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE RICHMOND AREA A LOT OF THEM ARE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA AND I DO HAVE SOME THAT LIVE IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA THANK YOU MUTE THE DAILY BASIS OUT OF RICHMOND AS THE COST OF LIVING. SO THE RICHMOND STAFF WILL BE RELOCATED WITH CELERY AND WE'VE DONE SOME- LOOKS INTO WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND THEY BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THIS IS A SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD TO ADJUST TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO. GO BACK TO SLEEP TOGETHER- IS THERE ALREADY. AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CSU SACRAMENTO. AS FAR AS A SPECIFIC AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW WE ARE PART OF THEIR MASTER PLANNING PROCESS THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES- PUBLICLY HAS APPROVED A SPECIAL LEAST AGO SITUATION WITH DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES OR A PLOT OF LAND THAT IS NEAR THE SACRAMENTO STATE CAMPUS BUT THOSE ARE STILL IN THE PRELIMINARY PLANNING BASIS. AND DID YOU THINK ABOUT- DOING THE- CONSOLIDATING THE OPERATIONS WITHOUT CLOSING DOWN THE RICHMOND. OF CAMPUS. YES WE DID- MADAM CHAIR WE LOOKED AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND HOLDING A RICHMOND CAMPUS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE YEAR BY YEAR THE COSTS RELATED TO THE LEAST ABOUT PROPERTY. ARE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO LOOKED AT HIS THE STATE BEING ONE OF THE LESS COMPETITIVE SALARIES IN THE STATE HAS A LOT OF COMPETITION FORENSICS IN THE BAY AREA WERE- LOCALS THAT ATE A LOT MORE FOR THE FRENCH SCIENTISTS. THE COST OF LIVING IS HIGHER AND SO IT WAS CONTRARY TO OUR GOAL OF ACTUALLY BRINGING ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER INCLUDING THE DNA FACILITIES IN THE DNA DATA BANK INTO A MORE COST EFFECTIVE AREA WHERE WE CAN HAVE A GREATER COLLABORATION WITH OUR STATE PARTNERS. AN OF FINALLY WHAT IS THE TIMELINE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THAT I'M SURE THE TIMELINE RIGHT NOW IS ANYWHERE FROM FOUR TO FIVE YEARS MOST LIKELY ON FIVE YEARS AS LONG AS EVERY STEP ALONG THE WAY IS APPROPRIATELY GROUP. I'M SORRY FORTY FIVE YEARS MEANING THAT'S WHEN IT'LL BE BUILT OR MEANING. YOU WILL START. I'M SORRY ABOUT A JOB THAT WOULD BE A MOVE IN DATE. A MOVE IN DATE OF. HELLO MR MEDRANO.

MATTERS IN THE FACE YOU- REDEKER MISTER JOE. YEAH IF YOU CAN JUST GIVE A THE- AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHAT THE NEED IS. YES MADAM CHAIR- AS MR RYAN MENTIONED- ONE OF THE MANY THINGS THAT THE SECTION DOES IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PROPER COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE. I THINK YOU SEE THIS IN IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE MARKET ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES AND THAT IS OF THE GREATEST CONCERN IS OVER CONSOLIDATION WITHIN HEALTHCARE MARKET WHICH THEN DRIVES UP COSTS. AND SO WE HAVE SEEN- WE HAVE SEEN AND OVER THE LAST YEAR ESPECIALLY AN UPTAKE IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE CONSOLIDATION WITHIN HEALTHCARE FACILITIES- DUE IN PART I. TO HAVE THE TRAIN IN GENERAL IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ALSO- LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE CODED PANDEMIC- AND THE CONCERN. WHEN THERE'S AN UPTAKE IN CONSOLIDATION IS THAT YOU END UP WITH- BEING BILL HE NEXT MUCH LIKE SATTAR I'M AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE MADAM CHAIR OF BOMB WE- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WAS RECENTLY IT'S A QUITE SUCCESSFUL. IN BRINGING ON A LAWSUIT AND THEN ULTIMATELY A SETTLEMENT- AGAINST AT CENTER FOR ITS ANTI COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND SO WITH INCREASED RESOURCES WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO.

AND TO INVESTIGATE AND BRING SUITS AGAINST OTHER LARGE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO MIMIC I CENTERS ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR I'M IN IT. WITH OUR CURRENT RESOURCES UNFORTUNATELY HRA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE ARM AT ALL IN THAT THIRD BACK AND I THINK YOU INCREASINGLY WE'RE EVEN SEEING A LOT OF- THAT RESOURCE IS BEING BEING TAKEN OUT BY. AT TRANSACTION REVIEW WHICH WERE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE CORPORATIONS. ON THE OTHER AREA OF ANTI COMPETITION WHERE WE ARE I'M SEEING ADDITIONAL NEED FOR RESOURCES AND WORK WITHIN COMPETITION IS IN PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG PRICING- IN ORDER TO BRING. THAT CASE. IS I'M- AGAIN STAFF PHARMACY COME THAT ENGAGE. AND TRUMP- BE LIKE PAPER TO GREEN- IN TO LOOK AT IT AND READ IT WHILE. AND BY FARMS BENEFIT MANAGERS THAT ARE ARE RESULTING IN. HIGHER DRUG PRICES- WE DO NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON THESE CASES BEGAN AS AN INVESTIGATION WITH ONE OR TWO DADS BUT THEN AS THEY- YOU KNOW APPROACH TRIAL YOU NEED AN ENTIRE TEAM- SO WE THINK WITH CURRENT RESOURCES WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN AN ADDITIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG PRICING. MATTERS FORM INSTIGATING PBMS FOR INSTANCE. WONDERFUL OKAY THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHADE ALL YOUR WORK. MOVING ON TO ISSUE EIGHT CONTINUATION OF CURES TO HELP DESK RESOURCES.
