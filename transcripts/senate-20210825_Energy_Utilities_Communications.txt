IN AS CLOSE TO THE SAME MANNER AS IS CUSTOMARY. THERE MAY BE SOME LAG TIMES FOR PARTICIPANTS WERE ADJUSTING TO THE NEW USE OF ONLINE TOOLS TOOLS OR TECHNOLOGIES. PLEASE BE RESPECTFUL IMPATIENT TO ALL INTERESTS SO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES COULD BE HEARD WELCOME EVERYBODY OUR HEARING TODAY IS BIFURCATED INTO SECTIONS. THE FIRST IS A FOCUS ON ELECTRICITY RELIABILITY. AND THE SECOND PORTION OF THE REQUIRED ANNUAL UPDATES FROM BOTH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE READY TO BEGIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY YEARS CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED ROTATING ELECTRICITY OUTAGES WHEN THE ELECTRIC GRID OPERATOR THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR. FORCED ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY OUTAGES IN ORDER TO BALANCE I'M IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE LECTURE CITY SUPPLY AND DEMAND ON FRIDAY AUGUST FOURTEENTH AND SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY. THE OUTAGES OCCURRED IN THE MEN'S METS THE BUT EXTREME HEAT WAVE AFFECTING MUCH OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES THE AUGUST FOURTEENTH ROTOR ROTATING OUTAGES CAUGHT MANY BY SURPRISE AND RESULTED IN THE LOSS F POWER DURING THE EVENING HOURS TO NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS WITHIN CRISIS FOOTPRINT. FOR THE DURATION OF FIFTEEN MINUTES TO NEARLY TWO AND A HALF HOURS DEPENDING ON THE UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORY. THE AUGUST FIFTEENTH ROTATING UTAGES AFFECTED FEWER CUSTOMERS FOR SHORT SHORTER DURATION SPECIFICALLY. THREE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE THOUSAND CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCE ROTATING OUTAGES RANGING BETWEEN EIGHT MINUTES IN THE SDG AND E. CERTAIN UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORY. TO ONE AND A HALF HOURS IN THE PG&amp;E UTILITY SERVICE TERRITORY WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON CUSTOMERS IN BETWEEN THESE EVENTS OCCURRED AT A TIME WHEN TEMPERATURES WERE SOARING. AND CALIFORNIANS WERE RELYING ON ELECTRICITY TO BOTH OPERATE AIR CONDITIONING IN ORDER TO KEEP COOL AND TO MAINTAIN CONNECTIVITY HAS MANY WERE WORKING OR STAYING HOME IN ORDER TO REDUCE YOUR RISK OF INFECTIONS FROM THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AS WE ALL CAN ATTEST AND AS A PANDEMIC HAS UNDERSCORED. ELECTRICITY IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO SUPPORT MODERN LIFE THEREFORE IN ANY BIG UNEXPECTED AND EVEN EXPECTED LOSS OF POWER CAN POSE INCONVENIENCES CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL HARM SOME CONTEXT FOR THESE OUTAGES IF WE CAN PROVIDE SOME THE ROTATING OUTAGES IN AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY WERE VASTLY SHORTER DURATION THAN SOME OF THE RECENT EXPERIENCES WITH PRO ACTIVE POWER SHUT OFF USED BY UTILITIES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK FROM UTILITY EQUIPMENT OR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OUTAGES WHICH IN MANY CASES CAN BE HOURS EVEN DAYS FOR FULL RESTORATION OF SERVICE. NONETHELESS THE ROTATING OUTAGES EXPERIENCED IN AUGUST ALONG WITH SUBSEQUENT POTENTIAL THREATS OF ROTATING OUTAGES SINCE AUGUST RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE ELECTRIC GRID OPERATOR AND STATE AGENCIES TO NEED TO EXTREME HEAT EVENTS WHICH MAY BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE CLIMATE CHANGE THE PURPOSE OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO LEARN WHAT ACTIONS ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE CHI'S SO THE CPUC AT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IN ORDER TO MITIGATE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE WIDESPREAD ROTATING OUTAGES WE HOPE TO SPECIFICALLY HERE HOW THESE ENTITIES ARE WORKING TO BETTER PREPARE THE ELECTRIC GRID FOR EXTREME HEAT EVENTS ESPECIALLY TO ENSURE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE DURING THE NEXT PEAK LOAD. THE TIME WHEN ELECTRICITY DEMAND IS STILL HIGH BUT VARIABLE RESOURCES SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THANK YOU. TO EVERYONE WHO IS PARTICIPATING TODAY ALSO SHOWED UP TO THE VICE CHAIR THANK YOU. FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS- HEARING TODAY. I'D LIKE TO GO STRAIGHT- DIRECTLY TO THE PRESENTERS I SHOULD NOTE THAT ALL OF THE PRISONERS ARE PARTICIPATING. REMOTELY WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE CPUC PRESIDENT MARIBEL BANTER WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT TO OUR HEARING TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING FOR THE- RESIDENTS OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WAY SO AND VICE CHAIR DOLLY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. FIRST I WANT TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME AND MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR SHOULD BE BEFORE YOU TODAY. ONE OF THE LESSONS FROM LAST AUGUST IT IS THAT IT IS CRITICAL WE ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY AND BETTER INFORM THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS. REGARDING THE POTENTIAL CHALLENGES WE SEE AHEAD OF US THIS AND IN SEVERAL SUBSEQUENT SUMMERS. THE VARIOUS PUBLIC MEETINGS HOSTED BY OUR- RESPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR INCLUDING. THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS SERVED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE IMPORTANT LESSON AND RESPONSIBILITY. LAST YEAR OUR ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN MOVING ALMOST NONSTOP TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF LAST SUMMER'S EVENTS. WE WROTE THE GOVERNOR THEN THAT WE QUOTE SHARED IN THE RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDE MANY CALIFORNIANS UNNECESSARILY INDOORS. AND WE COMMITTED OURSELVES TO IMPROVING THE STATE'S POSITION STAND A SIMILAR EXTREME WEATHER EVENT IN THE FUTURE AND TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF THOSE WE SERVE. MEETING THIS COMMITMENT AS REQUIRED AN ENHANCED LEVEL OF COORDINATION AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SINCERE GRATITUDE. FOR THE COLLABORATION SUPPORT THE LEADERSHIP AND STAFF OF OUR RESPECTIVE ORGANIZATIONS. HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN SOME DO GOING THE SUMMER WE JUST PLAN INPUT TO BETTER REFLECT THE CHANGING CLIMATE REPORTER CUMAN OF ADDITIONAL SO RESOURCES LIKE STORAGE AND CREATED INNOVATIVE DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS TO HELP ENSURE WE'RE SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS. DURING THE CRITICAL HOURS OF THE DAY WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING BUT ENERGY USE REMAINS HIGH AND WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO OUR ENERGY MARKET RULES AS WELL. ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN DONE PROPERLY AND WITH GREAT SENSITIVITY TO LIMITING ANY NEGATIVE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE CITY IS PART WE HAVE FACILITATED THE DIRECTOR PROCUREMENT OF CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHED- ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT HAVE INCREASED DEMAND. AND SUPPLY SIDE RESOURCES FOR THIS SUMMER AND NEXT. SPECIFICALLY WE ORDERED I- USED TO BE CURING MINIMUM OF AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF RESOURCES REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE INCREASE OF THE PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN. FROM. 15% TO SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE. WE ESTABLISHED A PILOT EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE LARGE CUSTOMERS FOR VOLUNTARILY REDUCING DEMAND WHEN CALLED UPON BY CALAIS SO IN THE EVENT OF A GRID. THE MARGIN SEE WE ALSO ORDERED MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS TO EXPAND OR JUST A PATIENT AND INCREASED ENROLLMENT TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS AND WE RE LAUNCHED A NEW STATEWIDE FLEX ALERT PROGRAM EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN ENERGY DEMAND IS HIGH. FOR THIS EASY HAS BUILT UPON ANALYSIS AND DEVELOP NEW ANALYTICAL PRODUCTS FOR INSTANCE IT HAS ENHANCED ITS DEMAND FORECAST BY INCLUDING ONE IN THIRTY PEAK FORECAST. TO ITS TWENTY TWENTY INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY REPORT. THE CDC IS ALSO EXTENDING THE FORECAST TO COVER FIFTEEN YEAR HORIZON INSTEAD OF A TEN YEAR HER EYES AND IT IS UTILIZING CURRENT MODELS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AS WELL AS EXPANDING HOURLY FORECASTS TO EXAMINE A WIDER RANGE OF WEATHER PATTERNS. THE CDC ALSO LET OUR WORK ON PLANNING CONTINGENCIES WHICH HAVE BEEN UTILIZED THIS SUMMER HELLO AYSO IS PART IT IS INCENTIVE FOR HOURLY REFINED PRICE SIGNALS TO BE MORE ACCURATE SET A MINIMUM STATE OF CHARGE FOR BATTERIES SUBSTITUTED SUPPLY PLANNING SUPPLY DURING PLANNED OUTAGES AND STREAMLINE THE GRID INTERCONNECTION PROCESS TO EXPEDITE NEW SUPPLY. HAS ALSO WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND NEIGHBORING BALANCING AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE COORDINATION AND CLEAR CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATIONS. HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED HOWEVER IN THE IN OF THE CHANGE CLIMATE ARE CHALLENGING EVEN THESE BEST EFFORTS AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PLACE ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON ELECTRIC GRID THIS SUMMER AND BEYOND AS WE ALL HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRST HAND THE ACCELERATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS CREATED EXTREME AND UNPREDICTABLE HE INTENSE DROUGHTS AND WILDFIRES ACROSS THE WEST. ALL OF WHICH ARE MORE FREQUENT MORE INTENSE AND LEAD TO AID AT EIGHT ATTITUDES MAY STRESS ON A LECTURE ON THE ELECTRIC GRID ESPECIALLY DURING CRITICAL HOURS OF THE DAY THE COMMISSION'S GONNA WALK US THROUGH THESE AND OTHER CHANGING CONDITIONS EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO PROBLEM SOLVE IN REAL TIME AS WE WORK TO GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM STILL FOR S. AS WELL AS OUTLINED THE ACTION IN THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION. WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S POSITION TO MAINTAIN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY THIS SUMMER AND FALL AS WE CONTINUE TO INJURE DRY AND HOT CONDITIONS. AND THE HEIGHTENED RISK OF WILDFIRE BUT BEFORE I HAND IT OFF TO COMMISSION BELINDA I WANT TO BE CLEAR OUR WORK TOWARD OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE IS MOVING FORWARD. AND WILL ONLY ACCELERATE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. THE RECORD HEAT EVENTS AND SEVERE DROUGHT WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS THE WEST THIS SUMMER SHIP TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOLVE AND COMMITMENT TO DELIVER A CLEAN AND RELIABLE ELECTRIC GRID THE ORGANIZATIONS HERE TODAY CONTINUED TO COLLABORATE ON CRITICAL PLANNING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT TO BUILD AN ELECTRIC SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP IT WILL MEET OUR 100% IN CLEAN ENERY GOALS. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION AND I DARE SAY THE WORLD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES INNOVATIVE DEMAND RESPONSE. AND TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. S. IS ESSENTIAL TO PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS HOWEVER IN OUR ECONOMY DETERRING CATASTROPHIC CLIMATE CHANGE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK MY ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERS FOR THE WORK WE HAVE DONE AND MUST CONTINUE TO DO AND AGAIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE YOU TODAY AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION. I DON'T NOW TURN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CDC. COMMISSIONER SEVEN BELINDA THANK YOU WE'LL HEAR FROM COMMISSIONER STEPHEN GUNTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON ON OUR LIST HERE THE SALES LICENSE ALI AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY AND TALK TO SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE- DONE AND LEGALLY. OUR WORK SIXTY HOURS. HI MY NAME IS LINDA I AM A COMMISSIONER OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION AND CURRENTLY LEADING. SEATING FOR LIABILITY EFFORTS AFTER THE EXTREME HEAT ON PUBLIC SUMMER THE END OF COMMISSION COMMITTED TO THE BALLOT OF ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND TO SUPPORT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. AND THAT'S BUDGET MENTIONED A CONTINGENCY PLAN AND YOU COMMISSION ASK THAT LED TO SOME pESTIMATE THE POTENTIAL GAP BETWEEN SUPPLY AND DEMAND UNDER AVERAGE AS WELL AS EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE AT THE NEXT MEETING IN TWENTY TWENTY. TO RESPOND FOR THE ACTUAL CONTINGENCIES THAT HELPS A BIT ANALYSIS WHAT PRESIDENT AT AN INTEGRATED ENERGY PLANNING REPORT- WORKSHOP- WORKSHOP WAS JOINTLY HELD. BY THE CCC PSE AND QUESO. IN MAINE AND IDENTIFIED A POTENTIAL SHORTFALL OF UP. TO TWENTY THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOLLOWING THE UNEXPECTED WEATHER EVENTS IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR AND EVERYBODY UPDATED INFORMATION ON CROP CONDITIONS SEEM TO STOP UPDATED THE ANALYSIS OF THE LATEST DEMAND AND SUPPLY CONDITIONS THE UPDATE UNDERTAKEN BY SEA TO STOP TALKING TO COME TO THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT ON HYDRO GENERATION AND ALSO ASSUMED. I'M CONTRACTED IMPORTS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE DUE TO EXTREME HEAT EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE WEST END OR WIFI AND LIMITING THE ABILITY TO HOUSTON PARKS ADULT CONTINGENCY MEASURES ARE IN ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER GENESEE STAFF PROJECT THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CALIFORNIA IS THE SYSTEM. COULD POTENTIALLY EXCEED AND UP TO THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF SHORTFALL IN SEPTEMBER IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME CONDITIONS. GIVING CLIMATE GIVEN EXTREME CONDITIONS INCLUDING CONTINUED AND MORE SEVERE DROUGHT AND ACCOUNTING FOR CURRENTLY PLAN TO TIGHTEN UP OUR PLANS. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND I LOVE THOSE SPECIES THAT PROJECTED SHORTFALL OF UP TO FIVE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN THE EVENT OF EXTREME HEAT. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WORD- EXTREME CONDITIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THE STATE ENERGY AGENCIES HAVE WORKED CLOSELY TOGETHER TO CARRY OUT MEDIA FACTIONS WITH THE INTENT OF MAINTAINING ELECTRICAL DELIGHTED TO SUMMER AND GOING FORWARD. DURING THE JUNE AND JULY STRESSED CONDITIONS GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED TWO SEPARATE EMERGENCY PROCLAMATIONS TO HELP SHORE UP CONTINGENCY MEASURES AND SUPPORT TO QUIT. BUT JULY THIRTIETH PROCLAMATION FOR THE SCREEN LINE THE ABILITY FOR THE AGENCIES TODEPEND ON THE CONTINGENCIES. THAT WOULD ALIGHT UPON IN JUNE AND JULY AND FURTHER. PROVIDES TOOLS TO EXPAND ON THOSE CONTINGENCIES. CAN YOU ACTUALLY HELP LINE IN THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION ARE BEING TAKEN OUTOF ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION AND A BACKSTOP MEASURES. ON THE BACKSTOP MEASURES DESIGNED TO KEEP THE POWER FLOWING USING WHAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE A DRYER HOTTER AND LOOKING TO SUMMER AND FALL. AS WELL AS EVEN MORE HEIGHTENED. BY FIVE SIX AND YEAH PROBABLY CREATE A NEW PROGRAM THAT PRO TODAY PAYMENTS TO CUSTOM WHO TO BACK UP ONLY ONE IMMINENT ENERGY SHORTFALL IS LIKELY EVEN IN A CASE LIKE SOCKS AND ALL THE OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES IT'LL EAT QUALITY FOR POWER PLANT SHIPS AND PORTABLE GENERATORS TO OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ONLY IN THE CASE WHICH IS A GOOD MORNING INDICATING AN ELECTRICITY SHORTFALL IMMINENT DUE TO EXTREME HEAT PRODUCED CAPACITY PORTABLE THE PROCLAMATION ENSURES TRACKING AND REPORTING OF EMISSIONS IMPACT AND DIRECTS THE AGENT RESOURCES BOARD TO DEVELOP A MITIGATION PLAN INCLUDING PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN COMMUNITIES. AND TO REDUCE. THE COST AND POPULATIONS YEAH COMMISSION IDENTIFY ACTION TO ACCELERATE ACHIEVING THE STATE'S 100% CLEAN ENERGY MANDATE THE LATEST PERMITTING AND WAIVE CERTAIN CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS AND LARGE COMPANY GENERATION CC ALREADY APPROVED SOME OF THESE PROCESS CHANGES AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION MEETING LAST WEEK POPULATION ALSO LEVERAGES THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE STATE TO ASSIST WITH PROCUREMENT OF MATERIALS GOODS AND SERVICES NECESSARY FOR PROJECTS LIKE YOU TO BE ONLINE BY OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. THAT WOULD EXPAND ENERGY SUPPLY AND STORAGE TO RESPOND TO ENERGY SUPPLY SHORTAGES CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WE W. R. HAD PROCURED I DIDN'T PLAN TO PROCURING MOBILE GENSET. FOR TWO EXISTING SITE- WANTED CALPINE GREENLEAF AND THE OTHER GIRLS WILL ENERGY PARK. WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT TOGETHER OKAY ABOUT FOUR OF THESE MOBILE GENSET TOTALING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEGAWATTS. AND I'M JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUE AND FROM FROM THE D. W. R. TECHNOCRATIC TO GO INTO ANY DETAILS ON THOSE QUESTIONS. THE GOVERNOR ALSO REQUESTED THE CBSE TO EXERCISE THE POWERS TO EXPAND DEMAND AND SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES FOR NEXT SUMMER THE CDC HAS ALREADY RESPONDED BY THE INITIATING IT SOMEWHAT A LOT OF THE PROCEEDINGS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF INCLUDING THE PROCUREMENT OF THESE ENERGY SOURCES FOR SUMMER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. THE PROBLEM IS ALSO THE CASE TAKES TO EXPAND INTO THE TIMES WE TO THE PRE OTHER KEY STRATEGY AND ACTION WERE TAKEN TO ENSURE TO LIVE THIS AND NEXT SOMEBODY WELL WITH ANYTHING THAT WAS GO TOWARD A EXTENDING IT HOW MEGAWATT SUPPORT COME SMART A LADY PICK COLLECTIVE. FOR ALSO WORKING TO DEAL ON FEDERAL WAIVER BECAUSE POWER TO ENSURE WE ARE ABLE TO. THE AND- CRITICAL UNDER OF THE KIND HE YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION THAT I WILL HAND IT OFF TO GET ME IN THERE. PRESIDENT AND CEO OF KALISPELL WELCOME MR MEASURE. WE HAVE WITH US PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM. OPERATOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY JUST WANNA. INFORM THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AFTER THEIR STATE OPENING STATEMENTS WILL. GOING TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS TO- OF. THE- PRESIDENTS OF. OF THE P. C. AND THE COMMISSIONER. BUDDHA AND- THE SEA EAGLE ME- MR MAIN SIR- SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THEM ON THE SUBJECT. OF THE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- SO MISMANAGED OR IF YOU'RE PREPARED THANK YOU FOR JOINING THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHARLIE SO I PLACED YOUR DOLLY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF OUR ELECTRICAL GRID I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING SOME OF YOU OVER THE PAST YEAR BU THIS IS MY FIRST TIME APPEARING BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. AND I APPRECIATE BEING WITH YOU TODAY AS A NATIVE SAN FRANCISCO I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF OUR STATE CARE ABOUT COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE. WHAT ABOUT HAVING ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE ENERGY. AS YOU MAY KNOW EARLIER IN THE YEAR WHEN I WAS ASKED ABOUT OUR SUMMER READING THIS. I EXPRESSED GUARDED OPTIMISM THAT THE ADDITIONAL PROCUREMENT AND OTHER CHANGES WE PUT IN PLACE IN ADVANCE OF THE SUMMER. AT POSITION US BETTER THAN LAST YEAR. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN. AND AS PRESIDENT PATRICK COMMISSIONER GOING TO HAVE TO MENTION. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS WITH ADDITIONAL RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES. UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRES. PERSISTENT DROUGHT AND DECLINING HYDRO CONDITIONS WE CLEARLY HAVE MOVED INTO A NEW NORMAL. IT IS REQUIRED EXTRAORDINARY ACTIONS TO BALANCE ELECTRICITY SUPPLY AND DEMAND. AND MAINTAIN RELIABILITY FOR CALIFORNIANS DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY IN COORDINATION WITH THE C. P. C. AND C. E. C. THE I SO TRIGGERED WHAT IS KNOWN AS OUR BACKSTOP.PROCUREMENT AUTHORITY. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY AN EMERGENCY MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS US TO DIRECTLY PROCURE ENERGY WHEN THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE STATE'S RESOURCE ADEQUACY USING THAT AUTHORITY WE WENT INTO THE MARKET YOU WERE ABLE TO SECURE APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATT HOUR FOR THE MONTH OF JULY. SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST. AND SIXTY SEVEN MEGAWATTS FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER. THE EXTRA CAPACITY HAS BEEN HELPFUL BUT EVEN WITH THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE STILL FIND OURSELVES IN THE MIDDLE OF EXTREMELY CHALLENGING GREAT CONDITIONS. KIND OF CULMINATING ON JULY NINTH WHEN THE BOOTLEG FIRE IN OREGON CUT OFF THE MAJORITY OF POWER SUPPLY FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE CONDITIONS WERE CONTINUING TO DETERIORATE IN THE COMING RECENTLY AND PREDICTABLE WE APPRECIATE GOVERNOR SINCE EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION ISSUED ON JULY THIRTIETH. THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE PROCLAMATION WILL GIVE US ACCESS TO NEW TOOLS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL BACKUP GENERATION. WHICH WILL OF COURSE ONLY BE USING ARE THE MOST STRESSED RATE CONDITIONS. WE ARE ALSO VERY MUCH AWARE THAT SOME OF THESE RESOURCES WILL RESULT IN INCREASED POLLUTION WE'RE COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING A LOADING QUARTER APPROACH WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR THE USE OF CLEANER RESOURCES. BEFORE DURING YOUR OPTIONS. THE NEW DEMAND RESPONSE TOOLS BEING DEVELOPED BY THE STATE WILL ALSO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF DURING EXTREMELY STRESS FREE CONDITIONS WE APPRECIATE THE SENSE OF URGENCY AND DECISIVENESS BUT THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOW ABOUT TWO THIRDS F THE WAY THROUGH THE SUMMER. WE NOTE THAT EXTREMELY STRESSFUL CONDITIONS TO PLAY OUT AGAIN IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD. AND WE OF COURSE NEED TO BE PREPARED BY THE STATE TAKES ON THE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TASK OF BRINGING NEW CAPACITY ON SHORTBREAD. TO SOLVE CHALLENGING THAT KEEP YOUR SHOES TO KERR FOR US AFTER SUNSET ALONG WITH THE C. P. C. IN C. C. B. I. S. O. REMAINS EXTREMELY FOCUSED ON DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE WE BRING THOSE RESOURCES PART OF THE GRID. ALL THE SUPPLY SIDE IN THE JUST. INSIDE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. THAT WAY WE CAN TAKE OUR GREAT AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE STORE MORE HEALTHY RESERVE MARGIN FOR THE STATE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A BIT MORE ABOUT TWO AREAS THAT% WILL BE A MAJOR FOCUS FOR THE I SO IN GETTING THIS DONE. FIRST WE'VE IDENTIFIED SET OF SPECIFIC LOCATIONS ON THE TRANSMISSION GRID. WHERE THERE IS EXISTING CAPACITY THAT CAN BE UTILIZED IN THE SHORT TERM. TO BRING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES OUR SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY BATTERY STORAGE WHICH IS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE VERY HELPFUL IN DEALING WITH BUT NET OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THE CALIFORNIA CHASEN'S. AND OVER THE LONGER TERM TO OUR NEWLY LAUNCHED TWENTY YEAR TRANSMISSION OUTLOOK PROCESS. WE INTEND TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC AND ACTIONABLE TRANSMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CDC NCPC. THE GUY PROCUREMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS SP ONE HUNDRED GOALS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL FOR STATE POLICY MAKERS AND UTILITIES TO ACHIEVE AS MUCH ALIGNMENT AS POSSIBLE. ABOUT THE CRITICAL NEED FOR TRANSMISSION TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET THOSE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. I BELIEVE I CAN STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT ADDITIONAL TRANSMISSION WILL BE INDISPENSABLE IN ENABLING CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS LONG TERM DECARBONISATION TARGETS. TRANSMISSIONS OF ELEMENT REQUIRES LONG LEAD TIME SO WE MUST ACCELERATE OUR ACTIONS NOW. TO BE PREPARED FOR CLEAN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS IN THE YEARS AHEAD. AND TO DEVELOP THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND LEAST REGRETS TRANSMISSION OPTIONS FOR THE STATE. FINALLY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE IDEA SO WE'RE ALSO VERY MOTIVATED TO PLAY A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE. IN FURTHER ENABLING DEMAND RESPONSE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES TO BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY PORTFOLIO AND STRATEGY. WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE NEW WORK HAPPENING AT BOTH THE CPC AND THE. CC ON THESE TOPICS. INSTEAD READY TO BE A SORT OF OUR MAKE SURE HE RESOURCE PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ENERGY FUTURE ALL OF US AT THE I. S. AND STAND READY TO DO WE CAN TO HELP THE STATE THE SCREEN AND PROJECT IT'S NOT RELIABLE ENOUGH FOR FASHION AND I TOO DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION WITH MY PARTNERS AT THE C. P. C. C. C. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOUR WAY SO BY SURE DOLLY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR YOUR TENNIS ON THESE CRITICAL ISSUES. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE SEVENTY TWO. THIS CONCLUDES OUR OPENING STATEMENTS AND WE'RE ALL HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND COME TO MEMBERS QUESTIONS I WANT TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS RELATED TO. IMPORTS OF ENERGY IMPORTS ARE RELATED TO TRANSGENDER G. TRANSMISSION AND ALSO RELATED TO- SOME RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE RECEIVE THIS PAST PAST MARCH FROM THE WESTERN ELECTRIC COORDINATING COUNCIL AND THE FIRST QUESTION OF COURSE WOULD BE RELATING TO IMPORTS ONE OF THE AREAS OFCONCERN. IS THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WITH IMPORTANCE ESPECIALLY THEIR RELIABILITY DURING EXTREME HEAT EVENTS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE NORTHERN PART OF THE WESTERN REACHES AN EXPERIENCE YOU TOO HIGH PEAK PERIODS IN THE WINTER AND IN THE SUMMER AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RELY ON THESE IMPORTS IN THE SUMMER. AS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RE- RELY ON IN PREVIOUS YEARS CAN YOU SPEAK. MORE TO THIS CHALLENGE AND HOW YOU ARE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN ANY OF THE WORK RECENTLY. CERTAINLY SURE WISH I'D BE I'D BE HAPPY TO START OUT BY ASKING THE QUESTION IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND I THINK RIGHT ON POINT. AND IT HIGHLIGHTS THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF STRONG COORDINATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND THE ADJACENT REGIONS FROM WHICH WE BOTH. IMPORT AND EXPORT ELECTRICITY BECAUSE THEIR SIGNIFICANT INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THESE REGIONS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE OFFICE AND OVER THE LAST YEAR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT GETS SIMULTANEOUSLY VERY HOT. ALL APART J. SYSTEM BY REGIONS AND NOW WE ARE FORCED TO SPEND MUCH MORE TIME COORDINATING CLOSELY WITH THE TEAMS IN THE NORTHWEST CARPOOL WITH FOLKS IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE LOADED RESOURCE BALANCE IS CHANGING THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES. THESE OTHER UTILITIES ARE ALSO UNDERTAKING SIGNIFICANT DECARBONISATION OBJECTIVES pAND GAS PLANT RETIREMENTS HAPPENING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WEST AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE HAVING TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME NOW BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THOSE CHANGES MAY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA AND JUDGE ADJUST OUR PLANNING ASSUMPTIONS ACCORDINGLY THERE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS VALUE OVER THE YEARS FOR CALIFORNIA. J. SHOULD REGIONS BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE ENERGY WHEN WE HAVE A SURPLUS WE CAN SHIP IT WHEN THEY HAVE A SURPLUS WE CAN IMPORT IT BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE ATTENDED TO THE CHANGES. AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT IMPORTANT QUESTION. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER DID ANYONE WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT AND MAYBE- FROM PC OR FROM THE. ENERGY COMMISSION ANYTHING AT ALL DON'T MISS CHECK THINGS THAT PRESS AND CEO MEANS- EXPLAIN THE SIX. WELL WE HAPPEN FOR SEVENTY DEGREES IMPORTS OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS- WITH THE CHANGING OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND I MEAN NOT JUST THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THE NEIGHBORING STATES. ENVIRONMENT AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT- WITH SOME OF THOSE CHANGES WE HAVE REALIZED THAT WE- WE DO NEED TO. BE MINDFUL OF ALL OF OUR NEXT. TIME THERE IS A NEED SO- I THINK. THE THREE ENERGY AGENCIES HAVE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR PLANNING PROCESS. TO REALIZE SOME OF THE CHANGING US SITUATIONS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITH THE IMPORTS. THANK YOU- THE NEXT. QUESTION RELATED TO TRANSMISSION MY PROVIDE A OF TRANSMISSION PROJECTS AND- THAT OF THE- CLEAN- AMERICAN CLEAN POWER HAS NOT NOTED. ARE STYMIED INCITING OR INNER CONNECTION OR OTHER COMMITTEE IN- PROCESSES SO I UNDERSTAND THE C. P. U. C. N. CHI SOURCE ARE- THE STAFFS ARE REVIEWING THIS LIST AND WILL PROVIDE US AN UPDATE AS A FOLLOW UP TO TODAY'S HEARING SO BUT HOWEVER. I WELCOME YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ON TRANSMISSION RELATED ISSUES AS- ANOTHER. THAT WOULD BE- HELPFUL FOR US HERE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES AND CHALLENGES WITH TRANSMISSION IF ANY GIVEN. THERE WAS A KRANZ CONSTRAIN TRANSMISSION DURING THE AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY OUTAGES SO DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE ON THAT POINT SPECIFICALLY. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO START I JUST BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRANSMISSION OF PLANNING A WITHIN THE STATE YES- SO WE HAVE RECEIVED AN INQUIRY FROM STAFF AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CPC TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE SPECIFIC ISSUES AND WILL BE. REPORTING BACK TO YOU ON THOSE QUESTIONS SHORTLY BUT AS I AS I STATED ALSO IN IN MY OPENING REMARKS YOU KNOW ANYWAYS I SOMETIMES THINK OF TRANSMISSION. REALLY IS THE SORT OF GATEWAY TO THE FUTURE YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT LINKS UP SUPPLY. WITH DEMAND. HELPS US TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLLABORATION WITH OTHER REGIONS IT REALLY IS GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PART. OF THE STATE'S RESOURCE PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE WHILE ALSO OBVIOUSLY STAYING VERY SENSITIVE TO COST FORTY BILLION MAKING GOOD CHOICES SO WE WERE VERY PLEASED. TO BE WORKING NOW MUCH MORE CLOSELY WITH THE CDC AND THE CPC. NOT ONLY IN THE VERY SHORT TERM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE PLACES ON THE GRID WHERE WE HAVE SPARE CAPACITY WHICH REALLY COME TO THE TABLE NOW WITH CHAR CITED VERY SPECIFIC AND PRAGMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS. ON WHERE WE WHERE WE THINK THE BEST TRANSMISSION OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO ACCESS THE CLEAN ENERGY. CAPACITY RESOURCES CRITICAL TO GETTING ONE GOAL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO GREATER PERSUASIONS ABOUT THIS WITH THE STATE WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE WE IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC PAGE POINTS IN SPECIFIC SETS OF SOLUTIONS IN LOCKPORT WORKING WITH YOU- AND MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF. TO TRY TO REALLY UNLOCK CAPABILITY TRANSMISSION OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. THE WESTERN ELECTRIC COORDINATING COUNCIL ISSUED ITS OWN RECOMMENDATIONS THIS PAST MARCH FOR THE BROADER WESTERN REGION IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE AUGUST OUTAGES AND THE CONSTRAINED GRIT I'M HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE A FOLLOW UP AS TO WHAT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS IF ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING INCORPORATED INTO YOUR ACTIONS IF THEY ARE NOT CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE NOT. SPORTS FOR TODAY I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A GENERAL REACTION TO THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. AGAIN I'M I'M HAPPY TO JUMP IN AND PRESENT BACHELOR PROJECT CONTRIBUTED A SKILL TREE OF COURSE- BUT YES WE HAVE- WEDC HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY VERY INTERESTED AS THE ENTITY IN THE WEST UNITED STATES HAS. OVERARCHING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MONITORING THE STATUS OF RELIABILITY ON THE WESTERN GRID THEY WERE QUITE ATTENTIVE TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA THEY PRODUCED A SET OF FINDINGS WHICH LARGELY CORROBORATED THE BASIC TAKEAWAYS FROM OUR ANALYSIS. THEY ALSO POINTED OUT AND GETTING TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION INSTRUMENT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE CHANGES IN THE RESOURCE PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE WEST- AND QUITE FRANKLY. THEY THINK THEY'VE INDICATED THAT EVERY MAJOR SUB BASIN IN THE WESTERN AND STATES. IS RELIANT ON IMPORTS 21 DEGREES OR ANOTHER. TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORIES AND THEY'RE EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION INFORMATION. DATA SHARING AND MUCH GREATER STATE AWARENESS WITHIN THE REGIONS FOR WHAT THE SUPPLY DEMAND BALANCES FOR THE WHOLE WEST BECAUSE WE'RE ALL PART OF AN OVER ARCHING. MARKET FOOTPRINT AND WE NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND THOSE FUNDAMENTALS AND LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES T SHARE ENERGY CAPACITY TO WORK ON TRANSMISSION DEVELOPMENT BUT WE'RE IT WE'RE ALL FACING SCARCITY AND SHORTAGES AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER. VERY CONSERVATIVELY TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS FOR THE. ENTIRE WEST NOT JUST CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER TO HAVE AN EMAIL OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD LIKE TO. ASK ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR DOLLY THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ON- AS WE AS WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR AND THE PAST YEAR- YOU KNOW WE WERE IN A DROUGHT. WE'RE ALSO SEEING FIRE AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING A TRANS WHAT WE'RE TRANSFORMING FROM. WE'RE GONNA SHUT DOWN NUCLEAR DIABOLOS GONNA GO DOWN IN A COUPLE YEARS US LIKE THREE THOUSAND I THINK TWENTY HUNDRED MEGAWATTS AND YOU TALKED ABOUT AT THE I. S. O. U. YOU WERE ABLE TO SECURE A COUPLE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS AT THIS POINT AND SO WE'RE TRANCE WE'RE WE'RE TRANSFORMING FROM AN ENERGY SOURCE. THAT IS WHAT IT WAS IS NATURAL GAS IT NUCLEAR AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO I HEARD YOU SAY BATTERIES HAS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS ON THE COST AND RELIABILITY OF HOW HOW WHAT THE COST TO THE RATEPAYERS GONNA BE FOR BATTERY STORAGE TO TAKE CARE OF US FROM WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IN THE WIND'S NOT BLOWING AND THE WATER IS NOT FLOWING. IT'S DIFFICULT IN THIS FORMAT AND CHRISTOPHER TO EITHER I'M PRESIDENT PATRICK COMMISSION GRANDER THINGS LIKE OFFERING OPTIONS ON THAT YES. HE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS DOES EXACTLY THAT- LAST YEAR DOLLY AND- WE ALSO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT RATE IMPACTS- WE HAVE A PROCEEDING THAT DOES THAT- THE STRONGEST RATE IMPACTS CURRENTLY REALLY. FOR OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA R. ONE LACK OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION AND SHOOT TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS. BATTERY STORAGE IT IS AS I THINK PRESIDENT CEO MANGER ADDED EARLIER IN HIS COMMENTS HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN HELPING US MAINTAIN GRID RELIABILITY THIS SUMMER AND WE HAVE EASIEST DECISIONS SUPPORTED DIGITAL STORAGE IT IS COMING ON LINE AS WE SPEAK- AND WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEXT SUMMER TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. AND IN THE FUTURE- IN THE I. R. P. IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING THERE IS MORE- STORAGE THAT WILL BE ADDED ON TO THE SYSTEM MORE STORAGE IS THERE ANY IS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS ON THE COST OF STORAGE OF ONE MEGAWATT SO THAT WE COULD DO THE MATH WHEN WE WHEN WE FIGURE OUT HOW MANY MEGAWATTS WE'RE GONNA BE SHORT IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA PUT IT INTO STORAGE- SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN UNDERSTAND GOING FORWARD WHEN WE SHUT DOWN. WHICH WE USED TO TALK ABOUT GOING FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS. AND THAT WAS CLEANER AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING TAKING AWAY NATURAL GAS ARENA GO TO BATTERIES. SO IT'S AN N. AS- WE WENT OFF OF COAL OUR PRICES ESCALATED UP AND I'M ASSUMING THEY'RE GOING TO GO UP EVEN HIGHER. BUT WHEN WE GO TO A DEGREE AT THAT HOUSE BATTERY STORAGE. AND DOESN'T USE NUCLEAR OR NATURAL GAS. YES IF I MAY JUST BEFORE WE GO TO ANSWER THAT ON IT THE POLICIES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE- AS WELL AS AS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND NUMEROUS- THREE ADMINISTRATIONS HAS DETERMINED ARE VERY STRONG GHG GOALS WHICH WE ARE REACHING TO A VARIETY OF RESOURCES BATTERIES BEING VERY IMPORTANT TO IT AND IN SO DOING REACHING US GHG GOALS WE ARE RETIRING THE USE. OF THE RESOURCES THAT INTERNET GREENHOUSE GASES. SO IN ATTEMPTING TO HOLD VERY TIGHT TO THE GOALS THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SELLER'S FLORES WE ARE HAVING AN ENERGY MIX- PROCURING AN ENERGY MIX THAT INCLUDES BATTERIES IN TUCSON VICE THIS DEVICE HERE TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION. ABOUT HAVE WE CALCULATED THE COST OF THE- COST OF A MEGAWATT BATTERY. I NEED TO ASK AND RANDOLPH IS THERE ANY CHARGES DOING MANY OF OUR RATE STUDIES TO ADDRESS THANK OU PRESIDENT BADGER ON YES AND AT RANDOLPH THAT NEED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY THE U. C. YOU TOO THE- SPECIFIC COST OF BATTERIES- THE WAY THE P. YOU SEE WHEN THEY DO THE- INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS LOOKS AT. IS THEY TAKE THE COST OF VARIOUS- OPTIONS VARIOUS RESOURCES THAT COULD BE ME USED TO MEET OUR RELIABILITY AND OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND OPTIMIZES AGAINST US BUT WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT IN OUR PROCUREMENT ORDERS- WHAT IS NEEDED IN TERMS OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STORAGE OF SOLAR. WIND OF OFFSHORE WIND THAT IS BASED ON OPTIMIZING- THE COST IN PICKING THE LOW COST PORTFOLIO ALL RIGHT WE ALSO LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT- IT IS CONSTRAINED BY THE- ENVIRONMENTAL- POLICIES ARE SET IN STATUTE- BUT THERE IS SOME RANGE WITHIN THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE DIFFERENCES IN COST BETWEEN- HAVING A PORTFOLIO ELECTRICAL IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S- A FORTY SIX MILLION METRIC TONS. OF CO TWO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ONE AND A DEBT- THIRTY MILLION METRIC TONS IN THERE ARE COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THOSE- AND I CAN'T- RATTLES OFF TOP OF MY HEAD BUT HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE WITH YOU WITH YOUR OFFICE- ADDITIONALLY THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF- STUDIES DONE OUTSIDE OF THE P. U. C. LOOKING AT WHAT THE COST. OF MEETING. THE CLIMBING GOALS WOULD BE OR OPTIONS THE CLIMATE GOALS INCLUDING THE SQ ONE HUNDRED ANALYSIS THAT THE JOINT AGENCIES HAVE DONE- AS REQUIRED BY STATUTE- BUT TO NAME A FEW OTHERS- A RECENT ANALYSIS DONE BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES ON WHAT ORGANIZING THEIR GRADE WOULD COST- AND WON- BY THE GOLDMAN SCHOOL- LOOKING AT IT. YOU. KNOW NATIONAL COST OF DECARBONISING THE IN ALL OF THE STUDY FAIRLY CONSISTS SHOW THAT THE OF TO- CARBON FREE OR AT LEAST A 90% CARBON FREE GRANITE- HE'S EITHER THE MINIMUS OR SOME OF THE STUDIES EVEN SHOW IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN RELYING ON A GRID THAT WOULD REQUIRE NEW- NEW CALL A NEW NATURAL GAS VEHICLES THEN AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE VIDEOGRAPHY OF ALL THESE REPORTS IF THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL I ALSO WANTED TO JUST POINT OUT THAT IN S. B. THREE FIFTY I BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS THE OPTION TO CAL LARGE HYDRO AS PART IS OUT PERCENT GOAL AND- BUT WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO PUT IN HYDRO I BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN THOSE SCENARIOS HAVEN'T BEEN PUT IN AS PART OF THAT- 100% IS THAT. CORRECT. YEAH SURE GOOD NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT ABSOLUTELY AFTER SOME BADGER- THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE- QUESTIONS I JUST KIND OF FAT BUILDING OFF OF WHAT AND MATURE AND ALL KIND OF MENTIONED. TIME SIMILAR TO HOW THE MODELING IS DONE IN THE IRP PROCESS AND AS WELL AS THE SP ONE HUNDRED. JUST A FEW THINGS TO NOTE- AS AS MISTER RANDOLPH MENTIONED WE OPTIMIZE THEM AND BASED ON YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT ALL THE COST OF THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AND THEN WE OPTIMIZE BASED ON CONSTRAINTS- TWO TO THE CLIMATES BECAUSE WE CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THEN THE LEAST COST PORTFOLIO THAT IT THE LIABILITY AND SELECTED IT AS A PLANNING ASSUMPTION FOR THE FUTURE. SO BASED ON THOSE ASSUMPTIONS RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE CRITICISMS- OR FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED ESPECIALLY FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY- IS THAT IS OUR LACK OF TREATMENT OF NON ENERGY BENEFITS. ARE ARE KIND OF COSTING DOUBT A CARBON- FOR SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES- THAT THAT MAY BE STILL IN MEETINGS SO JUST WHEN I NOTE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE TRY TO OPTIMIZE THE COST. AND THE COST OF EXAMPLE AND GAS LEAK WHICH HAVE BEEN MISSIONS ARE NOT COMPLETELY TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AS A PART OF THE ANALYSIS. SECONDLY TO YOUR POINT ON THEIR LARGE HYDRO THANK YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE CORRECT THAT IT'S NOT A PART OF. OUR PS BUT IT IS A PART OF THE SP ONE HUNDRED ZERO CARBON- TECHNOLOGY LAST I DON'T WANT IT WHAT ARE WE COUNTED IF PART OF THE LARGEST IS THE BILL TO CARRY WHITE- WE COUNT IF I CAN FURTHER CLARIFY THAT IN TERMS OF- ANALYSIS ON GETTING TO OUR- TWENTY THIRTY ONE IS THE POINT WE'RE MODELING OUT TO RIGHT NOW- THE MODELING DOES ASSUME THAT ALL EXISTING LARGE HYDRO- CONTINUES- TO EXIST. ON INDIAN THERE- IT DOES NOT ASSUME THAT ANY NEW LARGE HYDRO WOULD BE BUILT- OUT THERE- I'M NOT AWARE OF HE- PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED THAT WOULD PRODUCE ENERGY ON WHERE ONE'S THERE. WOULD BE USED FOR WATER STORAGE OR OTHER PURPOSES BUT WOULD PRODUCE VERY LITTLE ENERGY. HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK BEYOND THE 60% R. P. S. TARGET AND START TALKING ABOUT- CARBON FREE THE ASSUMPTION IS ALL THE EXISTING LARGE HYDRO- WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE WEST CONTINUES. TO BE UTILIZED TO MEET THOSE GOALS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. OKAY I WILL GO TO SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU MISS SHEARER I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE FOR THE I. A SOUL- IF YOU HAVE YOUR POWER FOR THIS SUMMER- SESSION AND I CURED HUNDREDS OF MEGAWATTS USING. THE CAPACITY GERMAN MECHANISM- FOR THE SUMMER DUE TO THESE EXTREME CONDITIONS AND IT'S TRULY NECESSARY BUT CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE US AN ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL COST OF PROCUREMENT AND HOW IT WILL BE SPREAD OUT. OVER ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES BECAUSE THAT'S NEVER EXPLAINED IN A CHEESY THE POOR FOLKS WHO WIND UP PAYING FOR THIS SO PLEASE SHARE HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE EXPRESSED SHARE THE COSTS ARE SPREAD OUT OVER ALL LOAD SERVING AREAS YES THANK YOU SENATOR- I WILL GET BACK TO YOU WHICH TEAM AT THE VERY VERY LATEST ESTIMATE SPECIFIC DOLLAR VALUE OF THE PROCUREMENT FOR JULY. AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER- BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE APPROACH TO COST ALLOCATION FOR THAT IS THAT THOSE COSTS ARE SPREAD ACROSS BELOW BELOW IN THE SWITCH IN THE CALIFORNIA ISO BALANCING AUTHORITY. THIS IS THIS IS. UNDERTAKEN AS PART OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS OUR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE PREPARATORY WORK UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS THE PLANNING. MODELING HOW TO JUSTIN AND WE TOOK THOSE ACTIONS ORDINATION CPCC SEE THAT WHAT WE SPREAD ACROSS ALL THOSE ENTITIES AND- OUR BALANCING AUTHORITY AND CERTAINLY WE CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE TO HAVE TO USE THAT TOOL GIVEN THE CONDITIONS WE ARE FACING HOW WE FOUND IT NECESSARY R. M. I FULL OF QUESTIONS FOR THE PC. OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY IS THE ORDER OF THE DAY AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND ONE- ENERGY CRISIS AND ON. THE SERVICE- PROVIDING AND MAINTAINING- RELIABILITY SO WE TRULY UNDERSTAND IT SINCE THE CENTRAL. BUT IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS A NUMBER RESOURCE ADEQUACY CITATIONS AND FINES HAVE INCREASED- QUITE DRAMATICALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I THINK THERE WERE THREE CITATIONS LAST YEAR ALONE THERE WERE TWENTY. I'M CURIOUS- COULD YOU EXPLAIN- WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO REDUCE- THESE RESOURCE ADEQUACY VIOLATIONS AND HA. P. U. C. A RECENT DECISION AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY OF PROCEEDINGS IMPROVE THE PROGRAM- BECAUSE MANY FEEL IT'S CHEAPER TO PAY THE FINE. AND CITATION THEN TO PROCURE THIS POWER SO WHAT TOOL ARE YOU GOING TO USE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE- COMPANIES ARE ACQUIRING THE POWER VERSUS JUST STICK IN THE FINE SENATOR BRADFORD YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN ARMED RESOURCE ADEQUACY FINE AND- FRANKLY I FIND IT PRETTY DISTURBING- AND PARTICULARLY IN THE SITUATION THAT WE FIND OURSELVES IN THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR. AND FRANKLY FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BOTH DEMAND RESPONSE IN RESOURCE ADEQUACY ARE CRITICAL AND CRITICAL TO KEEPING IT RELIABILITY OF THE GRID- IN TERMS OF WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT IT'S A GREATER FINE- IN TERMS OF THE PENALTY FOR. WHICH SHE WILL DESCRIBE SOME OF THE ENTITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERED PART OF THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PORTFOLIO FIND IT EASIER TO PAY THE FINE THAT THEY DO TO- PROVIDE THE ENERGY SO I DON'T KNOW AND YOU WANT TO ADD A COUPLE THINGS TO THAT I'M SURE AGAIN. THANK YOU PRESIDENT DR- YEAH I MEAN IT IS AN EXCELLENT POINT THE- THE FINES FOR VIOLATION OF RESOURCE ADEQUACY AT THIS POINT ARE SOMETIMES LOWER THAN THE ACTUAL COST IN THE OPEN MARKET GOING OUT AND BUYING CAPACITY AND SO WE ARE- YOU KNOW WE DO SUSPECT THAT SOME LOADS ARE ENTITIES WOULD RATHER JUST PAY THE FINE THEY GO OUT THERE AND BUY RESOURCE ADEQUACY ON THE FLIP SIDE I AM AWARE OF- MANY OF THE ONES ENTITIES BOTH- YOU READERS AND I ARE USED TO CONTINUE TO BUY RESOURCE ADEQUACY AND AVOID THE PENALTIES EVEN IF THE COST OF COMPLIANCE IS HIGHER THAN THE PENALTIES- IT BRINGS INTO QUESTION KIND OF A RE LOOK AT THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY SET UP AS A WHOLE- YOUR SPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT IN THIS DAY AND AGE WE NOW HAVE OVER THIRTY DIFFERENT- LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THAT NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM. WHERE WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED- AND IT WAS A SMALL HANDFUL OF IT HE'S ACTIVE PARTICIPATE IN IT SO THE DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS. IN OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROCEEDING THERE IS A TRACK THAT IS LOOKING AT EXACTLY THAT QUESTION ON DO WE NEED TO- THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A DO WE NEED TO HOW DO WE REDESIGNED THE PROGRAM TO BETTER MATCH- THE CURRENT RETAIL AND WHOLESALE MARKETS ARE OUT THERE. UNFORTUNATELY I HOPE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE- THE TITLE N. OF REDESIGNING A MARKET LIKE THIS IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN DO OVERNIGHT- IT'S BEEN BEING DISCUSSED FOR. THE PAST NINE MONTHS OR SO THROUGH A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS AND HELMETS FOR PARTIES- IT WILL LIKELY CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR- BEFORE. THERE'S A FULLY DEVELOPED STAFF PROPOSAL ARE USEFUL WITH I THINK YOUR EX WITH IS CLEAR THE PROBLEM THAT IS EXISTED IN THE PROBLEM THAT EXISTS AND THIS WHOLE UTILITY SPACE RIGHT NOW IS. BEING CALLED BY THIS LEGISLATURE A LEGISLATOR WHO SHOULD'VE BEEN DELVING IN. THE SPACE TO THE DEGREE THAT THEY ARE UP AND WE SHOULD ALL LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS WHO HAVE DONE THIS FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS BUT- WE HAVE A LEGISLATORS AND- WHO. WANT TO REDESIGN THIS MARKET AND- IT'S RADICALLY CHANGED IT AND IT MAKES IT ALMOST I'M YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT TO SAY COMPLIANCE RELIABILITY IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT MODES SERVICE INITIALLY EXAMPLE CC AGE WHO ARE REALLY JUST A PROCURE A PROP UP OUR POWER BUT ONE OF MASQUERADE AT THE CHILLY SO WE HELP CAUSES PROBLEMS. THANK YOU. NOW SENATOR JOSH BECKER. THANK YOU CHAIR BUT MY QUESTION FOR THE PERFECTION P. U. C- ARE WE MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO INCENTIVIZE AND FAIRLY COMPENSATE DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS IT SEEMS LIKE WE SAW HIM FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT. I'M CONNECTING OTHERS IDENTIFIED LAST YEAR WHEN THE BASS LINES ARE SET BASED ON DAYS THAT ARE UNLIKE THE DAYS ARE SHORT JUST HAPPEN AND THEY'RE NOT BEING. COMPENSATED FOR REAL DEMAND REDUCTIONS. I WILL. SPEAK TO THIS BUT I ALSO AM- SHARE SOME RESPONSIBILITIES WITH I SO ON. SOME OF THE PLANNING. PROCESS BUT- WE HAVE MADE MANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER SIR- I THINK ONE OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS THAT MAYBE. IT'S BEING ALLUDED TO MY OWN CONNECT WHICH I'LL JUST TOUCH ON BRIEFLY. AND THAT IS SOME OF THE NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE ON. A PUT INTO PLACE SINCE MY DECISION IN MARCH- AND THAT'S A LITTLE THE LITTLE REDUCTION IN ENERGY PROGRAM WHICH I MENTIONED EARLIER WHICH IS A VOLUNTARY. DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM. AND THE- THIRD PARTY FOLKS AS- CONNECT CAN CERTAINLY ARE TAKEN THAT THERE'S A SECOND IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY- UNDERTAKEN BY THE I AM USING THAT'S CALLED. C. SEPT WHICH IT. STANDS FOR CALIFORNIA SECURE ENERGY PROGRAM THAT IS A PROGRAM THAT IS SET FROM NOW UNTIL OCTOBER VERY SHORT LIVED. AND AS I THINK- PRESIDENCY ON MANGER. EARLIER SOME OF THESE AND SAY THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE THESE TOOLS THAT WE NOW HAVE WE HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO USE FRANKLY. BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE RIGHT AT THE TIME WHEN I SO IS SEEN THE MOST STRESS ON TE GRID AND WHERE WE'RE AT A TIPPING PLACE SO SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ARE NOT PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNED. THAT WOULD WORK FOR- THE SMALLER SCALE DEMAND RESPONSE AND ENTITIES THEY ARE INTENDED FOR LARGE SCALE- DELIVERABLES IF YOU WELL I'M I'M NOT SURE IF I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION I'LL TURN TO ELLIOT IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING FURTHER THANK YOU PRESIDENT I WOULD JUST ADD YOU KNOW COMING OUT OF LAST SUMMER WE RECEIVED A LOT OF INPUT FROM THE DIMENSIONS COMMUNITY INCLUDING FROM ALL CONNECTED SOME OF THE OTHER THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THEY DID INDICATE TO US. THAT THEY FELT THAT OUR OUR BASE LINING METHODOLOGIES WHERE WERE UNDERMINING THEIR ABILITY TO. FULLY DELIVER THE CAPABILITY OF THEIR RESOURCES SO FOR THIS SUMMER- WE DID MAKE SOME CHANGES TO OUR BASELINE METHODOLOGY WHICH I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN PRETTY WELL RECEIVED AND TENDER OPENING UP SOME ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY AT THE END OF THE SUMMER WHAT CHANCE TO LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THAT THE- EXCHANGE IS WORKING AND IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL TRY TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. THAT MUCH. MORE PRODUCT THANKS YEAH IF I MAY- SENATOR- BECKER THIS IS STILL GOING TO FROM THE CC I'M JUST WANT TO ADD AN EXTRA IMAGE OF THIS MENTIONED- RIGHT AFTER THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS WAS WAS COMPLETED AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE D. R. P.'S- WE WERE ABLE TO JOINTLY HOLD A COUPLE OF SOME TABLES TO UNDERSTAND SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THIS LIGHTING AND OTHER OTHER TOPICS AS PERSON MEANS THAT MENTIONED- THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MODIFICATIONS MADE BY CHRIST SO HIGH IN THE SHORT TERM- FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT ALSO IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ICBC HOW DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IF YOU ARE WORKING ON IMPROVING THE BASELINE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE D. R. PROGRAMS WHICH COULD BE REFLECTED IN THE UPCOMING YEARS AND OUR CURRENT WORK IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED- SOMEWHERE IN THAT AT THE END OF MARCH NINETEENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND. THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL THEN GO TO CDC GREAT I APPRECIATE YOU ALL A THAT AND WORKING ON ELECTRIC JUST BE IN TOUCH CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OBEY THE PROBLEM WAS. IN NEST HELLO ESTIMATING THE BASELINE PRIOR TO DEMAND REDUCTIONS. BUT IT DOES SOUND LIKE AND YOUR- WORKING ON THIS WITH. INITIALLY FOLKS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET REX I THINK THEY CAN BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE- SOLUTION HERE. INCENTIVIZE THE RIGHT WAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE OKAY WE'LL CONTINUE TO MOVE ON WITH THEIR CALENDAR I WANT TO THANK RESIN BADGER COMMISSIONER GLINDA AND- PRESIDENT MANGER FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. I JUST WANT TO- GIVE A NOTE TO THE PUBLIC WHO'S LISTENING. WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT AT THE END OF TODAY'S HEARING. A CERTAIN DOLLAR DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT. CLLR FIND OUT WELL I JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS THE THEIR ANNUAL REPORT. AND WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT BROADBAND AT ALL AND ARE WE GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AT SOME POINT TO WHERE WE'RE GOING TO STICK TO OUR CALENDAR IN ORDER YEAH THAT'S THE NEXT ITEM OKAY YOU NEED TO EXERCISE A LITTLE BIT OF PATIENCE THERE. NOW WE'RE GONNA AGAIN NOW WE WILL TURN TO THE CPUC ANNUAL UPDATE AND WE- WILL HEAR FROM PRESIDENT BADGER AND WILL KEEP YOU ON THE SET OF THE PRESENT BETTER IF YOU STAY ON SO WE CAN HEAR THE ANNUAL UPDATE TO THE LEGISLATURE HERE WE GO- PUBLIC SAYING SOMEONE'S. SENATORS OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AGAIN MR VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE. YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST YEAR. I AM JOINED BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY RACHEL PETERSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CQC SHE IS ON THE TELEPHONE- AT EDWARD I THINK SHE IS ACTUALLY ON SOON TO. AND ALL WHO IS HERE WITH ME DON'T EXACTLY OBJECTIVE FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE. AND ROB OSBORNE WILL BE. JOINING US MOMENTARILY DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION THIS IS AN EVENTFUL YEAR AND THERE IS MUCH I COULD TOUCH ON IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL FOCUS MY PRESENTATION ON MATTERS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE AND THAT CUT ACROSS OUR MISSION TO ENSURE SAFE. RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICES AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY MUCH WORK IS SPENT OKAY START MAKING SURE CALIFORNIANS AGREED THAT THE STATE AND THAT CAN BE RELIED UPON. IN THE FACE OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE SO I WILL NOT ADDRESS THAT HERE THERE IS HOWEVER A STRONG LINKAGE BETWEEN THE TOPIC AND THE OTHER IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES WE ARE UNDERTAKING. WITH CLIMATE WHILE THE CLAIMANT IS NOT THE REASON WE ARE FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING RELIABILITY AND MEDICATING UTILITY CLASS. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES IN ENSURING CUSTOMERS. HAVE AFFORDABLE BILLS THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY AS A REGULATOR AND ESSENTIAL UTILITY SERVICES. HI MY CHANGE IS CREATING A CRASH THE PRESSURES THAT MAKE THIS WORK MORE CHALLENGING AND ALL THE MORE CRITICAL AS WE TOUCHED ON IN THE EARLIER PART OF THIS YEAR. WITH THAT IN MIND TODAY I WILL FOCUS ON ACTIONS OF CITY YOU SEE HAS TAKEN. OVER THE PAST YEAR TO ASSIST FAMILIES DEALING. WITH OPEN NINETEEN PANDEMIC SO THE WELFARE APPROACHES TO INCREASE GRINNED COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK RESILIENCY DURING EMERGENCY EVENTS TO DELIVER A RELIABLE AND CLEAN CRISP OF THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS INCREASING RATES TO OVERSEE P. GENIE JUST FRANKLY OPERATE SAFELY AND BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION OF A HISTORIC BROADBAND INVESTMENT HOUSE THIS SUMMER SO WE WILL INDEED. HAVE COME OF BROADBAND. WITH THAT I WILL BEGIN MY PRESENTATION A LOT YEAR AND A HALF AS PART OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO THE GROUP IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE HAVE WORKED WITH. MY FOCUS AND PURPOSE TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES RECEIVE SAFE AND RELIABLE UTILITY SERVICE AS PART OF THIS WORK THE COMMISSION PLACED MORATORIUMS ON GAS ELECTRIC VOICE AND WATER DISCONNECTIONS. AND DEPLOYED VARIOUS STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS WE ALSO INJURED MORE PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATE RATES FOR ENERGY I DON'T KNOW HIS CHARACTER IN THE FAMILY ELECTRIC RATES DISTANCE THAT ARE NON HISPANIC. AND LIFELINE BILL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS TO HELP REDUCE THE COST OF THESE ESSENTIAL SERVICES. IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING APPROPRIATED TO HELP RELIEVE CUSTOMER UTILITY A RESURGENCE WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED INTERIM PROTECTIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS WHO ARE BEHIND ON THEIR BILLS AND NEVER WIRED UTILITIES TO PROVIDE LONGER ARISING PAYMENT PLANS. FOR THEIR DRESSING OUT OF A RESURGENCE WHILE MUCH HAS BEEN DONE TO PROTECT AND EMPOWER CUSTOMERS THIS PAST YEAR WE KNOW MUCH MORE REMAINS AND AS THE IMPACT OF PANDEMIC OF CALIFORNIANS LIES YOU BOX WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW STRATEGIES TO ASSIST CUSTOMERS. ON TOP OF THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA BASED UNPRECEDENTED WILDFIRE SEASON TWENTY TWENTY AND ISSUE OR PRETENDS TO BE NO DIFFERENT WE HAVE ALREADY HAD OVER SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIRE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE BURNED OVER MILLIONS OF ACRES IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS ONLY IN AUGUST. THE DIXIE FIRE HAS BURNED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND ACRES MAKING IT THE SECOND LARGEST WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY REQUIRED EVACUATIONS AND MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PERSONNEL BEING MOBILIZED TO COMBAT THE FIRE. THE MONUMENT MCFARLAND AND COLOR FIRES HAVE A REACH. EACH REASONING BURNED WELL OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES THE CALLER FIRE IS RAGING ACROSS THIS YEAR. WITH EXPLOSIVE FORCE THREATENING P. THOSE LINES AND WELL DENTIST THE CYNICAL AND THISAND THREATENED NATIVE WHILE FURTHER SOUTH THE FRENCH FIVE HAS OUR BURNED OVER C. THAT ACRE AND MAYBE AN S. AND G. D. ENERGIZE SOME OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS OUR CHALLENGE OUR CHANGING CLIMATE HAS TRANSFORMED A WILDFIRE SEASON. MAKING IT LONGER AND MORE INTENSE YOU NEED FOR EXAMPLE HAS SAID THAT JUST 15% OF ITS SERVICE TERRITORY WAS IN HIGH FIRE THREAT. IN TWENTY TWELVE COMPARED TO TODAY WHERE 50% OF THE TERRITORY. IS NOW IN HIGH FIRE DANGER THE FACE OF THE CLIMATE WE HAVE ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES WELFARE MITIGATION PLANNING INCLUDING IN THEIR EXECUTION OF PUBLIC SAFETY OUR SHOPS WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN ACTION TO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF THE ELECTRIC WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK DURING THE QUALIFIERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOPS. IN TERMS OFOUR OVERALL EFFORTS AND UTILITY WELFARE MITIGATION WORK HAS BEEN AND THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE AT THE CBC THROUGH THE OVERSIGHT OF THE UTILITIES WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS BY THE WILDFIRE SAFETY DIVISION WHICH PURSUANT TO STATUTE. TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THIS PAST JULY AND BECAME THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY THE OPPOSITE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY SETS THE GUIDELINES EVALUATES APPROVES ENSURES COMPLIANCE. UTILITIES WATER MITIGATION PLANS ON THE WHOLE HOWEVER THE LAUGHTER EDUCATION PLANS ARE JUST THAT THEY ARE PLANTS. TRUE REDUCTION IN RISK WILL COME FROM THE EXECUTION OF THESE PLANTS IN THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAYING HE IS A STATUS EXTENSIVE COMPLIANCE OVERSIGHT AROUND IMPLEMENTATION. MOVIE NOT TO P. S. P. S. IMPROVEMENTS AMONG THE UTILITIES MANY WILDFIRE MITIGATION TOOLS IS A PROACTIVE SHUTTING OFF POWER TO CUSTOMERS DURING HIGH RISK SITUATIONS JUGGLING THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE NOT ANYTHING WHILE HIGHER. WELL THE UTILITIES MAY USE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF AS A WILDFIRE MITIGATION TOOL OUR MESSAGE TO THEM HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR. OUR SAFETY POUT HAVEN'T HELPED SKEWS ME PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOPS MUST BE A MEASURE OF LAST RESORT. IN THE LATTER WELL CLARIFICATION AND EACH YEAR THEY MUST WORK TO REDUCE THE SCOPE THE GENERATION. AND THE FREQUENCY OF THESE EVENTS AS YOU ALL KNOW VERY WELL SHUTTING OUT POWER TO WEIGHT K. WELL VERY REACH ME DISTRESS FOR THE AND CREATE CAN C. SAFETY SINCE TWENTY NINETY WE HAVE A JOB TO OF UP AND THEN TO POWER OF GUIDELINES TO DRIVE THE UTILITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNICATIONS AND COORDINATION WE HAVE IMPACTED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBES AND BILLABLE CUSTOMERS AND SHE TAKE APPROACHES THAT REDUCE THE SCOPE AND THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF THE OUTAGES ALL OUR GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN HEAVILY INFORMED I STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK AND INVOLVEMENT. IN REGIME PUT MANY CUSTOMER ADVOCATES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS HAS HELPED PROVIDE A CLEAR VIEW ABOUT THE P. S. P. S. EVENTS AND HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING CUSTOMERS AND HOW TO MINIMIZE THAT IMPACT PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR STATE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON ENSURING COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED IMPROVING HOW THEY IDENTIFY AND COMMUNICATE WITH MEDICALLY VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS AND SPEEDING UP AND EXPANDING THEIR BACKUP BATTERY PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THESE CUSTOMERS THE MEDICALLY BASED MEDICAL BASELINE CUSTOMERS DURING A P. S. P. S. S. SINCE THE DISASTROUS. OUR SHOPS OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE TELEVISA MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY WELL THE NUMBER PS PS OF THIS ONE UP. THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMER OUTAGES. HOURS WENT DOWN HOWEVER I MEAN. THERE STILL REMAINS SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ACCESS TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES DURING THESE EVENTS WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED A REQUIREMENT FOR COMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO INSTALL SEVENTY TWO HOUR POWER BACK UP. TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND POWER SHUT OFF THIS. EDISON AND PG&amp;E HAVE ALREADY CALLED PS PETER IT'S EVENTS THIS YEAR AND BE BEING IN THE MIDST OF AN ALREADY DIFFICULT WHILE WHILE HER SEASON WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE THEM SADLY CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THIS APPROACH. AS YOU MOVE INTO THE WILDFIRE SEASON AND BEYOND WE ARE COMMITTED TO SPURRING CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND UTILITIES EXECUTION OF PSP SO THAT'S REDUCING IMPACTS ON THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THESE EVENTS HAVE BOLSTERED SEVEN POSTED BY OUR ONGOING PARTNERSHIP WITH HALLOWEEN. S. AND CALCULATOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY ESPECIALLY THOSE CAN BE INTO THE MICRO GETS HELP ALSO RECEIVED ATTENTION IN THE EFFORT TO MITIGATE RISK AND IMPROVE RESILIENCY THERE ARE SEVERAL AVAILABLE STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE PUBLIC SAFETY SHUT OFF IMPACTS AND CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROVIDING ELECTRIC RESILIENCY IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WE JUST QUICK ACTION LAST YEAR IN ADVANCE OF THE LAST WELFARE SEASON TO ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT OF MIGRANTS RESILIENCY INCLUDING STREAMLINING ASPECTS OF THE INTERCONNECTION PROCESS. MODERNIZING TERRACE TO MAXIMIZE RESILIENCY BENEFITS REQUIRING UTILITIES TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN MAY IN MATTERS RELATED TO RESILIENCY PLANNING AND CREATING AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM HER NOVEL AND CLEAN COMMUNITY RECORDS AND RESOURCE NUMBER WHILE MUCH FOCUS HAS JUSTIFIABLY BEEN PLACED ON NEAR TERM GREATER LIABILITY AND RESILIENCY THE CQC HAS ALSO CONTINUED OUR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THAT WORK HAS BEEN MOVING FORWARD AND WILL ONLY ACCELERATE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. OVER THE MEDIUM AND LONGER TERM CD THE CITY CEBU CITY MUST ENSURE THAT ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES UNDER OUR JURISDICTION OUR PROCUREMENT FOR CARING ENOUGH RESOURCES. TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND FROM CLIMATE CHANGE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND INCREASED ELECTRIFICATION OUR TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING SECTORS THOSE RESOURCES MUST BE UNVEILED TO MEET DEMAND AT ALL HOURS INCLUDING THE SUMMER EVENING HOURS AS JULIE GENERATION IS DECREASING. AT A FASTER RATE THAN ELECTRICITY IS. THAT WHAT YOUR CITY DEMAND THE CDC MUST ENSURE THAT THESE NEW RESOURCES THEMSELVES SUPPORT OUR AMBITIOUS AND NECESSARY CLINICAL TO MEET THE STATE'S FUTURE LIABILITY AND DECARBONISATION NEEDS THIS SPRING WE ORDERED AT ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT INCREASE IN PROCUREMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AS PART OF OUR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCEEDING THIS IS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF CLEAN ENERGY CAPACITY EVER DIRECTED BY THE COMMISSION IN A SINGLE PROCUREMENT ORDER. ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS IS IN ADDITION TO THE APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW NET WELL THINK OF PASSING CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES THAT WILL COME ONLINE BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AS A RESULT OF PRIOR CPUC ACTIONS. THIS INCLUDES WILL WIND SOLAR BATTERY STORAGE AND SOLAR PLUS STORAGE WELL THE PURPOSE OF THE NEW BECOME IS PRIMARILY RELIABILITY TO REPLACE THE RETIREMENT OF DIAVEL CANYON AND THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING UNITS THAT ARGUMENT ALSO SUPPORTS OUR STATE'S LONG TERM GREEN CAP GREENHOUSE. GAS EMISSION GOALS WITH WITH REGARD TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE APPLE CANYON WE WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THAT COMES FROM THE FIRM ZERO EMISSION RESOURCES THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE. AMOUNT OF ZERO EMISSION PROCUREMENTS THAT HAS ALREADY TAKEN PLACE OVER THE PAST YEARS IN ANTICIPATION OF DIABOLOS RETIREMENT LOOKING AHEAD THE COMMISSION IS EVALUATING AND STRONGLY INCLINED TO A JOB IN A DECISION LATER THIS YEAR A MORE AGGRESSIVE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION METRIC TONS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGETS. IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR BY TWENTY THIRTY ONE FURTHER ACCELERATING OUR PATH TO A ZERO CARBON ELECTRIC SYSTEM LET ME CATCH ON RATES VERY QUICKLY UNDERMINE EVERYTHING I'VE DISCUSSED SO FAR IS THAT ALL OF THESE INCENTIVES COME WITH COSTS CALIFORNIA UTILITIES ARE CONFRONTING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT ARE PLACING UPWARD PRESSURES ON ELECTRIC GRATES PRESSURES THAT ARE EXACERBATED BY A CHANGING CLIMATE. OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS RATES ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED INFLATION AND INCREASED FOR THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER BY THREE POINT 5% TO FOUR POINT 5% PER YEAR THIS AMOUNTS TO AROUND AN AVERAGE MONTHLY BILL INCREASE OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS. THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS RECEIPT FOR EDISON CUSTOMERS. AND. SIXTY SEVEN FOR SDG AND E. CUSTOMERS THERE ARE VARIOUS REASONS FOR THESE PRODUCT PROJECTED INCREASES IN ELECTRIC RATES AS I MENTIONED IN EARLIER TESTIMONY WHILE HIGH MEDICATION COSTS BEING A SIGNIFICANT COST DRIVER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO GROW TO MEET DEMAND AND INTEGRATE CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES INTO OUR DECLINING ELECTRICITY SALES DUE TO THE GROWTH OF DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES. WILL RAISE ELECTRIC RATES FOR CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THEM ON THEIR PROPERTIES. WE HELD THE NANBAN IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR TO DISCUSS AND EXPLORE WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE RATE PRESSURES AND EQUITY CONCERNS MANY INTERESTING CONCEPTS WERE PROVIDED AND WE'RE USING THE IDEAS GENERATED. AT THAT ENVELOPE TO INFORM OUR APPROACH GOING FORWARD AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE ACTED TO ENSURE CUSTOMERS DO NOT HAVE THEIR UTILITY SERVICES TURNED OFF AT WORK WORKABLE PAYMENT PLANS AND HAVE MUCH. AND HAVE PUSHED UTILITIES TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND ENROLLMENT IN BILL REDUCTION PROGRAMS LIKE CHARACTER. IS AND LIFELINE IN ADDITION. WE'RE LOOKING AT LONGER SOLUTIONS UNDER TERMS OF TO OUR PORTABILITY PROCEEDING WHICH IS EXAMINING THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES TO ADDRESS RATE CONCERNED AND LOOKING AT ISSUES LIKE REGIONAL COST IN DEVELOPING APPROACHES THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO MEASURE. RACE AND RATE DISCOUNTS. ARE BASED ON AFFORDABILITY TO INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS. I WANT YOU VERY QUICKLY RUN THROUGH P. GINNY SAFETY OVERSIGHT AND THAT WE WILL GET TO BRUSH OUR BROADBAND PACKAGE. I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON CBC'S OVERSIGHT OF PG&amp;E FOLLOWING ITS EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY AND ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE A SYSTEM SAFELY AND IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ITS CUSTOMERS. AS A CONDITION OF P. GINNY'S EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY WE IMPOSE VARIOUS REQUIREMENTS INTENDED TO DRIVE P. JEANNIE OPERATE. MORE SAFELY AND TO PROVIDE CBC WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO HOLD P. GINNY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING PROGRESS IN THIS REGARD INCLUDING AMONG THESE TOOLS IS A CREATION OF A SIX STEP ENHANCED OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCESS AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY MONITOR. WHO REPORT DIRECTLY TO THIS COMMISSION IN THIS PAST YEAR WE UTILIZED THIS EXCEPT PROCESS PLACING P. JANICE ONE OF THE PROCESS AND REQUIRING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR ITS FAILURE TO SUFFICIENTLY PRIORITIZED EDUCATION CLEARANCES CURRENTS AND POWER LINES BASED ON WRIST. OUR STAFF IS OVERSEEING AND REVIEWING P. GENIES PROGRESS IN MEETING THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WE HAVE IMPOSED. WE ALSO OPERATES A SAFETY POLICY DIVISION THE SAFETY POLICY DIVISION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION OR AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY MONITOR WE WILL COME ON BOARD NEXT YEAR I HOPE AS EARLY AS JANUARY AND WILL REPORT TO THE COMMISSION TO AUGMENT OUR OVERSIGHT OF P. GENIES EXECUTION OF REAL TIME OPERATIONS TO ENSURE. THE UTILITY IS FOCUSED ON LONG TERM OUTCOMES THAT PROMOTE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. AS WE CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON HOLDING PG&amp;E ACCOUNTABLE FOR OPERATING SAFELY LAST WEEK I SENT A LETTER G. P. GINNY HAVING POPPY NOTIFYING HER THAT I HAVE REQUESTED CPUC STAFF TO CONDUCT FACT FINDING A RANDOM PATTERN OF SELF REPORTED MISSED INSPECTIONS AND OTHER SELF REPORTED SAFETY INCIDENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A RECOMMENDATION TO ADVANCE P. JEANNIE FURTHER. WITHIN THE ENHANCED OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT PROCESS IS WARRANTED AS I COMMUNICATED TO MISS POPPY SEED UC I HOLD CUSTOMER SAFETY AS A TOP PRIORITY AND EXPECT LEADERSHIP FROM THE P. JEANNIE TO EXECUTE ON ITS SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES THIS IS A MESSAGE P. JEANNIE HAS HER CARESSED MORE TIMES THAN I SHOULD HAVE TO EXPLAIN AND REPEAT. WHAT PG&amp;E IS UNABLE TO DO THIS ON ITS OWN WE HAVE USED AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE TOOLS AND AUTHORITY AT OUR DISPOSAL. TO HOLD PG&amp;E ACCOUNTABLE NOW WILLING TO. PACKAGE FILING I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE WORK WE HAVE STARTED TO IMPLEMENT THE HISTORIC SIX BILLION DOLLAR BROADBAND INVESTMENT WHICH INCLUDES THREE POINT TWO BILLION FOR A STATE WIDE OPEN ACCESS MIDDLE MILE NETWORK TO BILLION IN THE IN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FUNDS FOR A GRANT PROGRAM. THE LAST MILE CONNECTIONS TO UNDERSERVED HOUSEHOLDS IN THE STATE. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION FROM NEW LOAN LOSS RESERVE FUND THAT WILL SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT ISSUE BONDS TO BUILD THEIR OWN BROADBAND NETWORKS AND FUNDS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS. REACTS REFORMS TO THE PUBLIC HOUSING THE CAMERA AND THE UPDATES THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCE SERVICES VIA I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE SINGLE LARGEST STATE INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY BUT WE HAVE MUCH TO DO AND THE COMMISSION TO DEPLOY THESE FUNDS AND TRULY. BRING BROADBAND SERVICES TO THOSE MOST IN NEED WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE FIRST STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROVISIONS WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY FINANCE AND TRANSPORTATION TO SET UP AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENTS AND RECEIVE NECESSARY RESOURCE. WE CAN'T STOP THE NINETY DAY PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS REQUIRED FOR THE MIDDLE MILE NETWORK WE ARE ALSO ENGAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DISCUSS HOW THESE INVESTMENTS CAN TRANSFORM BROADBAND SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE FIRST MEETING OF THE MIDDLE MILE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS HELD LAST WEEK. AND WE WOULD LOOK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PROVIDING UPDATES TO YOU AS WE MAKE PROGRESS IN OUR JOINT AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION AND FINALLY WE WILL BEGIN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PROCESS FOR THE LAST MILE. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT. PROGRAMS IN THE COMING WEEK SO MISTER JERRY AND MR CHAIRMAN WITH THE IDEA YOU FOR THE IMAGE TO SPEAK YOU TODAY AND TO ALLOW ME TO ADDRESS SOME OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN THIS LAST YEAR YEAR AND A HALF- FOR THE CRITICAL ISSUES. TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUESTHAT THE CVC IS FACED WITH. AND WITH THAT MYSELF AND MY CLUB COLLEAGUES WILL BE HONORED TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU AND I'M PARTICULARLY- GRATEFUL FOR YOU- AT LEAST- HIGHLIGHTING THAT YOU DID ONLY MENTIONS SOME. OF THE THINGS WE DID THIS YEAR AND IN REVIEWING THE- TWENTY TWENTY ANNUAL REPORT I'M ALWAYS JUST IMPRESSED BY. THE IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT'S PUT TOGETHER INTO THIS REPORT AND PART CHECK YOUR LEAD TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE WAS JUST SO MUCH WORK DONE THIS YEAR. IN SO MANY DIVERSE AREAS YOU CAN REALLY LOOK AT THIS REPORT NINE COURAGE TO PUBLISH TO REVIEW IT IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE. AND IT SPEAKS. TO US SO MANY THINGS AT THE CPUC IS WORKING ON IN PARTICULAR SO IT'S- IT'S JUST SO ENORMOUS WORKLOAD EVERY YEAR AND I'M ALWAYS PLEASED TO PAGE THROUGH IT DOESN'T REALLY LOOK AT HOW FAST PC WORKS EVERY YEAR AT IMPLEMENTING. STATE LAWS AND DIFFERENT POLICIES AND HOW. EVEN INDEPENDENTLY LIKE THIS YEAR THEY UNDERTOOK. THE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY TRAINING OF STAFF IN LIEU OF THE GEORGE FLOYD INCIDENT. HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND I APPRECIATE THAT THERE WAS ALSO SOME SENSITIVITY TO THAT ISSUE- AND MANY MANY MORE SO I APPRECIATE THE REPORT I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION.

CENTER DOLLAR FOLLOWED BY A CENTRAL BANKER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO ALSO JUST RECOGNIZE THAT- YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH OF ATTEMPTING TO TRACK P. JEANNIE ON THEIR PROGRESS I'VE ALSO DONE THAT MYSELF AND OUT IN THE DISTRICT- MAKE CHECKING UP ON THEM IN THEIR LINES AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF MILES OF LINE AND- AND IT'S A- TALL ORDER SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND- AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO. HAVE A THIRD PARTY VALIDATORS WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT- FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE. BATTLING WILDFIRES IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY SUMMER DUE TO SOME SORT OF INTERACTION WITH- UTILITY PROVIDERS OF ENERGY SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ON BROADBAND AND I KNOW THAT WE PASSED. THE SP ONE FIFTY SIX- IT IS AN AWESOME PIECE OF LEGISLATION A LOT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE THE TRAILER BILL IMPLEMENTING THE GOVERNOR SIX BILLION BAHT PER PLANT BROAD. BAND PLAN. IS INTENDED TO FUND BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL WILL FINALLY CONNECT CALIFORNIA'S REMAINING UNSERVED. COMMUNITIES THAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT HAVE NO OR VERY SLOW BROADBAND SERVICE WHICH ARE MOSTLY IN HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS SP ONE FIFTY SIX ESTABLISHED. CALIFORNIA'S NEW UNSER STANDARD AS HAVING NO PROVIDER OFFERING LAST MILE SERVICE AT A- SPEED OF AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE. MEGABYTES PER SECOND DOWNSTREAM AND THREE MEGABYTES PER SECOND UPSTREAM DESPITE SP ONE FIFTY SIX CODIFYING A TWENTY FIVE THREE ANSWER STANDARD THE CPUC IS ALREADY USING A DIFFERENT STANDARD THE CPUC EARLY IN AUGUST IMPLEMENTED SP ONE FIFTY SIX AND THE STANDARD IS A HUNDRED DOWN WHICH DOES NOT FOLLOW SP ONE FIFTY SIX AND DOES NOT TARGET THE SIX BILLION. TO FINALLY CONNECT CALIFORNIA'S HARDEST TO REACH HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE ALSO IN HIGH FIRE DANGER DISTRICTS AREAS SO I WAS MY QUESTION IS WHY WOULD YOU CHANGE IT FROM. WHICH THE STATUTE SAYS TWENTY FIVE THREE TO A HUNDRED DOWN WE CAN ANSWER THAT- MISTER VICE CHAIR WE CONCERNED ALWAYS ABOUT PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER SO THEY ARE SAFE IN WILDFIRE AREAS AND THAT THEY CAN COMMUNICATE- SAFELY BOTH WAYS AND- AND OTHER TYPE OF BRUNCH PRIVATE ACTIVITIES SO I MEAN IN TERMS OF BROAD ROB OUR SPORT. FOR A EXPLANATION ANSWER YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION SIR THANK YOU. RON YES THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR- THE QUICK ANSWER IS WE HAVE NOT CHANGED THE STANDARD THAT WILL BE USING FOR THE LAST MILE FUNDING IT WILL BE TWENTY FIVE THREE AND FILING THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AS WELL AS SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX IT IS TWENTY FIVE THREE- I THINK THE CONFUSION CAME UP WHEN WE TALK ABOUT USING A HUNDRED DOWN AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE MIDDLE MILE. DESIGNATIONS WHICH WHICH CENSUS DESIGNATED PLACES WOULD BE CONNECTED THE SAME LOCATIONS APPEAR IN THE TWENTY FIVE THREE MAP AS WELL AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO UPDATE THE MAP WITH THE LOCATION. SO THE BOTTOM LIE IS THERE'S NO CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE MIDDLE MILE LOCATIONS- WHETHER. YOU DOING TWENTY FIVE THREE OR A HUNDRED DOWN TELL WHAT IT MEANS THAT THE WHO ARE I DID MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE NO AND I THINK WE'RE TALKING THE SAME THING IS MAYBE NOT MAYBE I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING BUT MAKE SURE THAT. THE UNDERSERVED OR NOT SERVED OUR FIRST IN EVEN THE MIDDLE MILE OR THE LAST MILE THAT'S CORRECT PERFECT THANK YOU OKAY I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION ON BROADBAND MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR INDULGING ME I'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE CAST OF RUNNING WHICH I- WAS A JOINT AUTHOR ON SIX TWENTY SIX SIXTY FIVE.
