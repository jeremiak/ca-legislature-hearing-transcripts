01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.104
COUPLE OF FINAL POINTS ABOUT

THE SELF DETERMINATION-

01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:19.509
PROPOSED CHANGES. SO FIRST A

01:01:19.575 --> 01:01:20.977
NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSALS

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.779
REALLY SEEK TO PROMOTE GREATER

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.014
ACCESS TO SERVICES PARTICULARLY

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.416
TO THOSE PREVIOUSLY UNDER

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:28.651
SERVED AND GENERALLY WE'D SAY

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.019
THAT THE INTENDED GOALS OF

01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:32.422
THESE- PROPOSAL SEEM TO REFLECT

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:33.556
WHAT JUST LATER PRIORITIES

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.758
BASED ON PREVIOUS ACTIONS TAKEN

01:01:35.825 --> 01:01:38.594
BY THE LEGISLATURE TO. INCREASE

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:41.330
ACCESS TO SERVICES AND ALSO TO

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.766
REDUCE DISPARITIES ALONG-

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.735

SERVICE ALONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.906
LINES. AND WE WOULD SAY HOWEVER

01:01:49.972 --> 01:01:51.174
THAT MOST OF THE PROPOSALS EVEN

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.910
IF THEY HAVE MERIT DO LACK- A

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.812
LOT OF DETAIL ON HOW THE FISCAL

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:57.747
ESTIMATE WAS DERIVED SO JUST

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.782
FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:02.318
SURE HOW MANY A BILINGUAL STAFF

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.088
TEDIOUS- ESTIMATES WILL RECEIVE

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:06.556
THE WAGE DIFFERENTIALS AND

01:02:06.622 --> 01:02:07.990
WHETHER THIS IS IN LINE WITH

01:02:08.057 --> 01:02:09.125
SORT OF THE ESTIMATES OF THE

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.393
NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO MIGHT

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.528
NEED THOSE SERVICES. AND WE

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:14.063
HAVE TO PUT IN A REQUEST FOR

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:14.964
THIS INFORMATION FROM THE

01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:16.232
ADMINISTRATION AND I WILL BE

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.201
HAPPY TO SHARE THOSE DETAILS

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:21.537
WITH BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE STAFF

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:22.538
WHEN WE RECEIVE IT. ON THE PAY

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:24.674
INTERNSHIP- THE PROPOSED

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.442
CHANGES TO THE LANGUAGE ON FOR

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:27.944
UNPAID INTERNSHIPS WE WOULD

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:31.214
NOTE THAT- CURRENTLY- PAID

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.649
INTERNSHIPS ARE CAPPED AT AN

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:36.285
ANNUAL AMOUNT BASED ON AN

01:02:36.352 --> 01:02:38.621
EARLIER AND LOWER STATEWIDE

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.990
MINIMUM WAGE. SO IN ADDITION TO

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:42.592
THE PROPOSED AT THE CURRENT

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.227
PROPOSAL LANGUAGE THE

01:02:44.293 --> 01:02:45.628
LEGISLATURE MIGHT ALSO CONSIDER

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:47.530
ANOTHER REFINEMENT SO AS TO NOT

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.031
NECESSARILY A LIMITATION

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:52.435
INDIVIDUALS CHANCE TO WORK ON.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:55.371
IT FULL TIME INTERNSHIP OVER

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:56.906
THE COURSE OF A SINGLE YEAR. NO

01:02:56.973 --> 01:02:58.207
ON THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO SELF

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.676
DETERMINATION- TO THE EXTENT

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.979
THAT THESE ARE CHANGES TO THE

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.481
PROGRAM EASE ENROLLMENT OR-

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.217
HE'S HE'S IN AS A SUCCESSFUL

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.386
TRANSITION TO THE PROGRAM. THAT

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:11.921
WOULD REALLY SEEM IN LINE WITH

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.389
LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO MAKE THE

01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.024
PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ANY

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:16.993
INTERESTED CONSUMER WE ARE

01:03:17.059 --> 01:03:19.028
STILL REVIEWING THE- TRAILER

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:20.329
BILL LANGUAGE THAT WAS JUST

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.797
RELEASED YESTERDAY BUT WE DO

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.866
HAVE TO INITIAL OBSERVATIONS

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.468
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO FLAG FOR

01:03:25.535 --> 01:03:27.937
THE SUB COMMITTEE. SO FIRST WE

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.972
DO THINK IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.908
REQUIRE REGIONAL CENTERS IN DDS

01:03:31.974 --> 01:03:33.843
TO REVIEW ON A REGULAR OR

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.311
ANNUAL BASIS THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:37.180
BUDGETS THAT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:40.683
SPENDING THRESHOLDS IN ORDER TO

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.051
KEEP THE PROGRAM COST EFFECTIVE.

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:44.187

EXPERIENCE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:16.118
TO- STOP ADVOCATE SOME FAMILY

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:19.254
MEMBERS- IS REALLY TO LOOK AT

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:21.290
HOW ARE WE MEASURING. THOSE

01:14:21.356 --> 01:14:22.357
AREAS IN WHICH THAT ARE

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:25.294
IMPORTANT- TO INDIVIDUALS BUT

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.197
THEN ALSO- AREAS THAT ARE

01:14:28.263 --> 01:14:29.798
MOVING FORWARD AS THE SYSTEM IS

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.834
GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO

01:14:31.900 --> 01:14:34.002
TO GIVE SOME EXAMPLES. THAT WE

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.370
DON'T WANT TO HAVE A

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:37.372
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:39.975
THAT IS- NOT FULLY THOUGHT OUT

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:41.610
AND MAKING SURE THAT IT IS NOT

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.946
OVERLY COMPLICATED- BUT IS

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.414
REALLY CLEAR AND SAYING OKAY

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.682
WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE

DO KNOW THAT THERE IS-

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.152
OBVIOUSLY SELF DETERMINATION AS

01:14:50.219 --> 01:14:51.320
AN EXAMPLE IS AN EXTREMELY

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:55.824
IMPORTANT PROGRAM. TO OUR

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.292
COMMUNITY- OUR CUSTOMER.

01:14:57.359 --> 01:15:00.062
SATISFACTION AND UNDERSTANDING

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.864
HOW INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCES

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:04.766
ARE- IS ALSO IMPORTANT OUTCOMES

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.635
ON EMPLOYMENT YOU KNOW ARE WE

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:07.836
HELPING INDIVIDUALS BE

COMPETITIVELY INTEGRATED- IN IN

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:11.974
THE COMMUNITY- AROUND

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.109
EMPLOYMENT- AND LOOKING AT

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:16.011
THESE KEY METRICS AND MAKING

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.546
SURE THAT- REGIONAL CENTERS

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:20.515
ARE. IMPROVING SO THIS FIRST

01:15:20.582 --> 01:15:21.750
YEAR WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.585
BENCHMARKS THAT WOULD BE FOR

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:25.888
STATEWIDE WE WOULD THEN HAVE

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:26.655
BENCHMARKS BY EACH REGIONAL

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.557
CENTER- BECAUSE ONE OF THE

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:30.392
QUESTIONS THAT'S RAISED ERE.

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:32.060
IS YOU KNOW HOW WOULD WE HAVE

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:33.562
SOME ASSURANCES THAT THE

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:35.497
INDICATORS AND TARGETS. YOU

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:37.466
KNOW OUR OUR MEETING THE NEEDS

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:40.235
OF KIND OF THE BROADER

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:42.037
COMMUNITY. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:43.639
AREAS THAT WE WOULD BE DOING IS

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.607
MAKING SURE THAT- REGIONAL

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.075
CENTERS I'M NOT ONLY HAVE A

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.810
MEASURE ACROSS THE STATE BUT

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.445
THEY WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE

01:15:50.512 --> 01:15:52.314
TARGET. THAT DEMONSTRATE

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:54.449
PROGRESS WITHIN EACH OF THEIR

01:15:54.516 --> 01:15:56.652
CATCHMENT AREAS ANOTHER ELEMENT

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.320
OF THIS WOULD BE REQUIRING

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.622
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- SO EACH

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:01.823
REGIONAL CENTER WOULD HAVE TO

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:03.492
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAD

01:16:03.558 --> 01:16:05.594
ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMUNITY-

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.262
AND SO THERE'S TRANSPARENCY NOT

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.730
ONLY AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT AT

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:11.300
A LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL- I'VE

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.568
BEEN ASKED TO ALSO KIND OF

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:15.404

FINE OF EIGHTY NINE POINT FOUR

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:27.382
MILLION AND THAT REALLY IS. THE

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:29.151
THAT THE LION'S SHARE OF THAT

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:31.286
IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING CASELOAD

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.956
RATIOS SO AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.090
THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.725
THAT WE'RE REPORTING ON AND

01:16:36.792 --> 01:16:38.593
MIND ALIVE IS WHAT ARE THOSE

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:40.462
CASELOAD RATIOS RIGHT NOW WE'RE

PRESENTED- WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.384
ACHIEVE THAT. AND THERE WOULD

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:05.787
BE A SMALL SMALLER PORTION THAT

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.255
WOULD BE EARMARKED FOR THOSE

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:08.924
INCENTIVES AND PAYMENTS TO

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:11.526

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:25.434
STRICT FOR K. LOW THAT'S REALLY

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:26.234

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.369
PORTION FOR AND- OURS AT ALL

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:31.106

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:32.507
JONES AS FAR AS THE CPAS I'M

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:33.341
WHAT LOOKING AT IS. WORK

THROUGH THE- OVER THIS YEAR IS

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.777
TO KIND OF THAT BREAK DOWN BUT

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:37.612
IT TO ANSWER THE LATTER PART OF

01:18:37.679 --> 01:18:39.948
YOUR QUESTION IS THAT- IT

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:41.883
REALLY IS INTENDED TO REDUCE

01:18:41.950 --> 01:18:43.785
CASELOADS. AND THEN TO HAVE A

01:18:43.852 --> 01:18:46.188
PORTION OF IT THAT IS BEEN

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:48.590
EARMARKED SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.292
INCENTIVES OKAY SAID. YES OKAY

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:51.927
SO THAT'S A GREAT THAT THEY

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:52.627
DOES ON THE CLIFFS IT WHICH

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.296
MEANS THAT THE PORTION OF IT.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:55.897
IS NOT REALLY CALLED AND SENT

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:58.033
IT IS TO LITERALLY. GET THE

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.035
CASELOAD DOWN SO AND THEN THIS

01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.403
OTHER PORTION THAT'S ACTUALLY

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:03.472
BEING USED AS THE INCENTIVES

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:06.308
PORTION SO THAT DOES ALL OF

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:09.377

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.935
OF THEIR FIVE FIRST SINCE I

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.437

RESPONDING TO THANK YOU. CHRIS

ARNOLD APARTMENT PLANES ARE

01:19:40.075 --> 01:19:41.243
ACTUALLY NOTHING FURTHER AT. I

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:45.180
THINK. THANK THANK YOU VERY

AND WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.086
THIS PROPOSAL SO WITHOUT

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.521
PREJUDICE TO THE MERITS OF A

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.055
PROTECT THE POTENTIAL MERITS OF

01:19:54.122 --> 01:19:56.324
A PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PROGRAM

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.059
WE DO NOT THAT THE GDS SYSTEM

01:19:58.126 --> 01:20:00.262
STILL HAS THE SAME THREE

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:01.730
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES THAT

01:20:01.796 --> 01:20:02.697
COULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

01:20:02.764 --> 01:20:04.966
ACHIEVE SUCCESS WITH THE

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:05.534
PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVE

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.036
PROGRAM. THE FIRST IS OUTDATED

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:09.471
SERVICE PROVIDER RATE SEVEN

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:12.607
OVERLY COMPLEX RATE STRUCTURE.

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:13.942
THE SECOND WHICH HAS ALREADY

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.310
BEEN DISCUSSED OR THE SERVICE

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.945
COORDINATOR CASELOADS THAT ARE

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.280
OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.147
STATUTE AND FEDERAL

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:21.016
REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN THE

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:23.351
THIRD ISSUE WE- IT THAT YEAH

01:20:23.418 --> 01:20:25.020
CHALLENGES THE SYSTEM IS A LACK

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.422
OF- GOOD DATA AND DATA SYSTEMS

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.791
AND THE ABILITY TO REPORT. ON

01:20:29.858 --> 01:20:31.793
OUR ON REPORT INFORMATION ON A

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.396
REGULAR BASIS. SO WE KNOW THAT

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:35.964
THE PROPOSAL AS DISCUSSED WILL

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.332
BEGIN TO ADDRESS CASELOAD

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.967
RATIOS BUT IT WOULDN'T DO THIS

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:42.003
UNTIL- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE.

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:43.305
AND WHILE WE DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:55.317
DDS HOPES TO LINK. ANY NEW

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:55.951
REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS FOR.

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:57.752
TO THE NEW LEADER- PERFORMANCE.

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:58.853
WE ALSO THAT LET'S CONTINUE

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.288
GROW AND- HAS AN IN. ON THE CAN

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.857
SIR- AND TO. IS THAT THE SHORE.

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.926
OF SERVICE CALL. MAYBE IS HIS

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:06.628
HUNDRED AND SIXTY. A RED THAN

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.896
THIS HUNDRED PREVIOUSLY

01:21:07.963 --> 01:21:11.833
MENTIONED- IT AND THAT'S IN

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:12.867
TURN OF- WHAT STATURE AND

01:21:12.934 --> 01:21:15.604
REGULATIONS REQUIRE. THE

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:16.972
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.540
ALLOCATING SOME OF THE FUNDING

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:20.909
THAT'S PLANNED FOR TWENTY TO

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:23.545
TWENTY THREE IN THE BUDGET YEAR

01:21:23.612 --> 01:21:24.446
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO BEGIN

01:21:24.512 --> 01:21:25.046
TO ADDRESS THE SERVICE

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.948
COORDINATOR SHORTFALL EVEN

01:21:27.015 --> 01:21:28.450
WHILE RETAINING A PORTION FOR

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.518
THE INCENTIVE SCHEMES THAT

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:31.052
WOULD NOT START UNTIL THE

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:33.455
FOLLOWING YEAR. AND WE THINK

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:35.624
THAT THE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

01:21:35.690 --> 01:21:36.992
DEVELOPED THE FOLLOWING YEAR

01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:38.526
COULD THEN BE APPLIED TO THESE

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.895
NEW HIRES EVEN IF THE HIRES TO

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.298
PLACE THE PREVIOUS YEAR- THE

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:44.432
OTHER THING THAT WE WOULD WANT

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:47.235
TO POINT OUT IS- EDS DATA

01:21:47.302 --> 01:21:49.170
SYSTEMS ARE CURRENTLY FAIRLY

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.872
BRITTLE AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM

01:21:50.939 --> 01:21:52.741
AND LIKELY CANNOT SUPPORT SOME

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.309
OF THE SYSTEMATIC DATA

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.211
COLLECTION REPORTING THAT WOULD

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:57.012
MAKE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS VERY

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:59.180
SUCCESSFUL. WE KNOW THAT IN THE

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:01.016
PROPOSAL DDS INDICATES THAT IT

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:04.219
WILL BE TRYING TO IDENTIFY- NEW

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.054
DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS AND

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.723
TOOLS IN THE FIRST YEAR- BUT

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.458
THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.394
WE'VE MADE THIS. RECOMMENDATION

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:14.129
FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO APOLOGIZE

01:22:14.195 --> 01:22:14.829
FOR SOUNDING LIKE A BROKEN

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:17.132
RECORD. BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:20.502
COULD CONSIDER- A MORE ROBUST-

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:22.304
DATA SYSTEMS OVERHAUL IN THE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:24.306
DDS SYSTEM NOT ONLY WOULD THIS

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.907
HELP WITH THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM

01:22:25.974 --> 01:22:27.642
BUT IT WOULD ALSO HELP THE-

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:28.677
LEGISLATURE IN THE

01:22:28.743 --> 01:22:29.911
ADMINISTRATION MAKE MORE

01:22:29.978 --> 01:22:32.147
INFORMED POLICY AND FISCAL

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:33.248
DECISIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.850
GDS SYSTEM GENERALLY. AND THEN

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.152
THE LAST POINT THT I WANTED TO

01:22:37.218 --> 01:22:39.254
MAKE IS THAT- YOU MAY BE AWARE

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.022
THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN RESCUE

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:43.925
PLAN. ACT WAS PASSED TO THERE

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.860
IS A THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME

01:22:45.927 --> 01:22:48.296
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT BECOMES

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:50.198
AVAILABLE TO STATES FOR THEIR-

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:51.466
HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:53.435
SERVICES THIS WILL BE SORT OF

01:22:53.501 --> 01:22:54.969
TEMPER A TEMPORARY. SORT OF

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:57.105
ONETIME INFLUX OF FUNDING THAT

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.673
YOU CANNOT SUPPLANT SIMPLY ON

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.910
STATE FUNDING. AND WE'RE WE OUR

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.411
OFFICE IS WONDERING IF SOME OF

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:06.548
THESE PLANNING COSTS AND ANY

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:07.949
SORT OF CHANGES TO THE DATA

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:10.251
SYSTEMS MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE-

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:12.721
EXPENDITURES. UNDER THE

01:23:12.787 --> 01:23:14.255
GUIDANCE FROM CENTERS FOR

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:16.925

MORE MONEY UP FRONT TO GET THE

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.172
WE'RE CLOSER TO NINE HUNDRED

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:33.141
STAFF THAT WE NEED RATHER THAN

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.142
SIX HUNDRED AND IF WE'RE NOT IF

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.010
WE'RE DOING ALL THESE A

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:37.812
OUTREACH PROGRAMS. RIGHT THAT

01:23:37.879 --> 01:23:39.147
THAT'S THAT IS GONNA HOPEFULLY

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.548
PEOPLE CAN BOOST COMING BACK IN

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:42.350
THE SYSTEM WE CAN'T SERVE THEM.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:43.885
AND WE CAN'T MEET OUR CASELOAD

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.653
NUMBERS NOW YOU CAN HEAR THE

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.755
CONCERN AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.357

I APPRECIATE DID YOU STAGING

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:57.665
THINGS OUT.BUT IS THERE A

01:23:57.732 --> 01:23:59.667
CRISIS NOW THAT WE NEED TO MOVE

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:01.536
MORE QUICKLY. THANK YOU MADAM

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:04.305

THANK ANESTHETIC FOR.

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:08.877
REITERATING WHAT MY TESTIMONY

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.912
WAS AS FAR AS THE REFERENCE TO

01:24:10.979 --> 01:24:12.247
THE PROTECTION OF THE NUMBER

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:15.216
OF. COORDINATORS IF I SAID SIX

01:24:15.283 --> 01:24:16.217
HUNDRED I NEED TO CLARIFY THAT

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:18.486
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- IS

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:21.256
ACTUALLY OUR PRODUCTION- FOR-

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:23.291
WITHIN THAT REQUESTED FIND DEAN

AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED- SERVICE

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.265
COORDINATORS. SO IT ALL DEPENDS

01:24:30.331 --> 01:24:32.000
IT AGAIN ON KIND OF THE HIRING

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:34.569
AND WHERE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE-

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:36.037
BUT- I DID WANT TO MAKE THAT

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:39.574

WERE JUST RAISED- BUT WE DO

01:24:47.315 --> 01:24:48.383
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE USE

01:24:48.450 --> 01:24:49.884
THE FIRST YEAR TO MAKE SURE

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.953
THAT WE ARE- ESTABLISHING A

01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:54.656
PROGRAM THAT. IS NEW TO

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.958
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND-

01:24:57.025 --> 01:24:58.293
CERTAINLY EVALUATING WHAT IS

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.595
THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE- PER

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:02.263
PLATFORM- IT'S KIND OF THAT-

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:04.199
FRAMEWORK AND PLATFORM FOR

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.701
TRACKING AND REPORTING OUT- BUT

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:07.735
THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:09.437
HAVE THE RIGHT MEASURES. WE

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:10.872
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:11.940
ARE IMPLEMENTING THE OTHER

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:14.576
POLICIES AND- PRIORITIES THAT

01:25:14.642 --> 01:25:17.045
WE- WE'VE PUT FORWARD- FOR

01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:19.447
IMPLEMENTATION- BEARS THE

01:25:19.514 --> 01:25:21.382
SERVICE COORDINATOR. AND HAVE

01:25:21.449 --> 01:25:24.352
SERVICE COORDINATOR RATIOS- ED

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.421
CASELOAD FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVE

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.123
ZERO OR NO POS- AS WELL AS SELF

SOME SENSE TO THAT- YEAH I WE

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:16.524
KNOW THAT THINGS ARE MOVING

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:18.125
VERY QUICKLY AND THERE ARE NOT

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.661

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.242
THAT IDEA HAS SOME MERIT LIKE

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:35.943

THRESHOLD LANGUAGES INSTRUMENT

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.380

THAT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT EACH

02:05:44.036 --> 02:05:46.272
SOME OF THESE DETAILS SO FOR

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.040

SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MILLION-

02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:00.152
HOW THE SET REMAINING SEVENTEEN

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:08.460
WOULD SUGGEST FOR WHAT IT THE

02:06:08.527 --> 02:06:10.763
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IS TO

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:12.264

AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED AND THEN

02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:23.509
TO TARGET SOME RESOURCES TO THE

WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY DOING-

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:01.767
BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT I JUST

02:09:01.834 --> 02:09:04.002
NEED A FEW COMMENTS- IN TERMS

02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:06.605
OF- CAN WE TALK ABOUT THRESHOLD

02:09:06.672 --> 02:09:08.407
LANGUAGES OFTENTIMES RACIAL

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:10.175
LANGUAGES ARE DEFINED. BY ABOUT

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:11.610
PERCENT OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK

02:09:11.677 --> 02:09:12.311
THAT LANGUAGE IN THE GENERAL

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:14.146
POPULATION BUT IF WE'RE TALKING

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:16.081
ABOUT THE TYPE SERVICES- WE MAY

02:09:16.148 --> 02:09:17.749
ALSO A LOOK AT. PROPORTION OF

02:09:17.816 --> 02:09:19.485
PEOPLE SPEAKING THOSE LANGUAGES

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:20.853
IN RICARDO SERVICES WHICH MAY

02:09:20.919 --> 02:09:23.222
BE A DIFFERENT. COMBINATION I

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:25.090
WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTES- IN THE

02:09:25.157 --> 02:09:27.259
API COMMUTE FOR EXAMPLE ARE.

02:09:27.326 --> 02:09:32.564

02:09:32.631 --> 02:09:34.666
AS WELL- IS ONE SIDE OF THE

02:09:34.733 --> 02:09:36.468
DISPARITIES- OFTENTIMES THEIR

02:09:36.535 --> 02:09:37.669
LANGUAGES DON'T HIT THE

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:40.405
THRESHOLD SO- SO I WANTED TO BE

THE MAJORITY POPULATIONS NOT

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:56.355
LANGUAGE THAN A WRITTEN

02:09:56.421 --> 02:09:57.923
LANGUAGE AND I THINK IT'S VERY

02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:59.758

THE USE OF. THE EXCHANGE OF-DATA BOTH ON THE HOUSE SIDE AND

02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:07.085

HIGH TECH AND ARE ACTUALLY MADE

02:12:12.391 --> 02:12:14.459
SOME SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

02:12:14.526 --> 02:12:15.060
BUILDING WHAT I WILL CALL THE

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:17.329
ROADS- THE PIPELINE OF THE

02:12:17.396 --> 02:12:19.131
EXCHANGE OF DATA WHAT WE NEED

02:12:19.197 --> 02:12:20.799
TO DO NOW IS GET MORE FOLKS ON

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.200
THAT RELY ON THOSE ROADS OR

02:12:22.267 --> 02:12:24.369
WITHIN THOSE PIPELINES. AND

02:12:24.436 --> 02:12:26.004
THINK ABOUT WHAT STANDARDS AND

02:12:26.071 --> 02:12:28.373
FURTHER INCENTIVIZED- THE USE

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.941
OF THE SHARING OF DATA AND

02:12:30.008 --> 02:12:31.877
INFORMATION AMONGST DIFFERENT

02:12:31.943 --> 02:12:32.778
PROVIDERS AND DIFFERENT

02:12:32.844 --> 02:12:34.179
ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE

02:12:34.246 --> 02:12:36.982
SERVICES TO THE MOST VULNERABLE

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:37.983
AND AT RISK INDIVIDUALS IN

02:12:38.050 --> 02:12:39.551
CALIFORNIA. THE GOAL HERE

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.086
REALLY IS TO COUPLE DATA TO

02:12:41.153 --> 02:12:43.088
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.456
THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:46.158
BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:47.993
SERVICES THEY ARE ACCESSING AND

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:50.095
HOW WE CAN FURTHER SUPPORT-

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:52.297
THAT THEIR- THEIR AXIS OF

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.032
ADDITIONAL SERVICES IN ORDER TO

02:12:54.099 --> 02:12:55.567
ADDRESS THE NEEDS THAT WE MAY

02:12:55.634 --> 02:12:57.069
BE DOING AND THIS IS WHAT I

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:58.670
WILL CLARIFY HERE IS THAT. THE

02:12:58.737 --> 02:12:59.871
INTENT HERE IS NOT TO JUST

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:01.406
FOCUS ON THE EXCHANGE OF DATA

02:13:01.473 --> 02:13:02.808
AMONG STATE ENTITIES ALTHOUGH

02:13:02.874 --> 02:13:04.309
THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT IT'S A

02:13:04.376 --> 02:13:05.243
LINE OF EFFORT THAT WE'VE

02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:06.478
EMBARKED ON OVER THE COURSE OF

02:13:06.545 --> 02:13:07.679
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:09.881
THAT THE HIS HIGHLIGHTED- THE

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:11.783
URGENCY OF IT UNDER THE COVER

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:13.085
NINETEEN PANDEMIC. BUT THE

SAY THAT I THINK THE GOAL IS

02:14:58.824 --> 02:15:00.358

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.535
SOON PROBABLY WITHIN. THE FALL

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:12.537
PARAMETER CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:14.406
TO BEGIN TO MAP OUT HOW WE

02:15:14.473 --> 02:15:18.610
FURTHER ENGAGE. ON THIS

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:23.782
PARTICULAR TOPIC. SO WAIT YOU

02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:24.616

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:26.852
STARTED SOMEBODY GONNA START

02:15:26.918 --> 02:15:28.286
THE PLANNING AND THE ONE AFTER

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:30.388

SO I THINK THAT THIS IS AN

02:15:37.662 --> 02:15:39.364
ONGOING EFFORT I DON'T THINK AT

02:15:39.431 --> 02:15:40.699
NO POINT WILL WE EVER BE

02:15:40.765 --> 02:15:42.100
COMPLETELY TEN BUT THIS

02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:43.568

CHANGES TO STANDARDS WILL

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.139
CHANGE. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.040
GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT WILL

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:50.775
HAVE TO CONTINUALLY REVISIT.

02:15:50.842 --> 02:15:52.077
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IN THE

02:15:52.143 --> 02:15:54.479
FALL WILL WELL CONVENE EXTERNAL

02:15:54.546 --> 02:15:56.181
STAKEHOLDERS. OVER THE COURSE

OF THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

02:15:57.716 --> 02:15:59.484
WHAT WE'VE BEGUN IS LAYING OUT.

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:00.619
HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:02.120
INTERNALLY WITH SOME OF THE

02:16:02.187 --> 02:16:04.055
DEPARTMENTS WITHIN OUR AGENCY.

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.690

TOWARDS THE END OF THE BUDGET

02:16:06.992 --> 02:16:08.860
YEAR AND MOVING FORWARD.

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:10.462
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE TIME

02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:11.796
FUNDING THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO

02:16:11.863 --> 02:16:13.532
PROPOSE I THINK WE'LL COME BACK

02:16:13.598 --> 02:16:14.799

02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:16.668

02:16:17.903 --> 02:16:19.337
THERE'S ONGOING FUNDING NEEDED

02:16:19.404 --> 02:16:20.405
IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO

02:16:20.472 --> 02:16:22.307

SIDE ONE OF THINGS WE NEED TO

02:16:47.566 --> 02:16:49.634
DO IS THAT CERTAINLY IN ITSELF

02:16:49.701 --> 02:16:50.635
THE HEALTH INFORMATION SIEGES

02:16:50.702 --> 02:16:52.203
PORTENT BUT HE TALK ABOUT HOW

02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:53.838
THIS IS GOING TO HOOK INTO

02:16:53.905 --> 02:16:54.639
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM SO FOR

02:16:54.706 --> 02:16:56.741
EXAMPLE- WE DON'T KNOW PUBLIC

WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO- YOU

02:17:02.981 --> 02:17:05.417
KNOW- DISEASE REPORTING- YOU

KNOW WE THINK ABOUT DOING KODAK

02:17:06.885 --> 02:17:08.687
SCENES IN OUR VACCINE REGISTRY

02:17:08.753 --> 02:17:10.422
HOW THAT HOOKS UP AS WELL SO

02:17:10.488 --> 02:17:11.990
THERE'S- A POSSIBILITY OF

02:17:12.057 --> 02:17:13.491
EXCHANGE APPROPRIATE CHANGE OF

02:17:13.558 --> 02:17:15.393
DATA AS WELL TO SEND TO CERTIFY

02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.896
VACCINATION STATUS TO. IDENTIFY

02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:20.231
PEOPLE WHO STILL NEED VACCINES-

02:17:20.298 --> 02:17:21.900
AND BY LATE SUCH AS KODAK

02:17:21.967 --> 02:17:23.835
SCENES SO FORTH SO THERE'S A

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:25.170
LOT OF DATA YOU KNOW IMPORTANT

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:27.072
DATE AND I ONE THING I DON'T

02:17:27.138 --> 02:17:28.039
ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THOUGH

02:17:28.106 --> 02:17:29.341
IS ONLY TALKING ABOUT DISEASE

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:30.775
SURVEILLANCE IT'S NOT JUST

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.277
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. FOR

02:17:32.344 --> 02:17:33.945
EXAMPLE- APARTHEID DEVELOP A

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:35.880
STRATEGY TO ADDRESS CHRONIC

02:17:35.947 --> 02:17:40.318
DISEASES- THE ABILITY OF PUBLIC

02:17:40.385 --> 02:17:43.221
HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO INTERFACE

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:45.857
WITH- CONNECT WITH A HEALTH

OR- CAL THE COPD HIGH BLOOD

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:58.236
PRESSURE IT'S CETERA CAN BE

02:17:58.303 --> 02:18:02.240
ACTUALLY EXTREMELY VALUABLE. TO

02:18:02.307 --> 02:18:05.243
TO NOT ONLY THE STATE AND- AND

02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.412
BUT ALSO TO THIS- ORGANIZATIONS

02:18:07.479 --> 02:18:14.519
WELL TO HELP US. DEVELOP A MORE

02:18:14.586 --> 02:18:15.987
ROBUST. AB HEALTH AND- WE THINK

02:18:16.054 --> 02:18:16.988
OF BUILT IN. OF TYPES OF IN.

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:17.856
AND ALSO TO FIND OUT WHAT THE

02:18:17.922 --> 02:18:19.457
RESULTS OUR INTERVIEW. ARE SO

02:18:19.524 --> 02:18:21.192
DO YOU THINK ABOUT A MODERN DAY

02:18:21.259 --> 02:18:23.528
PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM- THAT

02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:25.897
ABILITY TO DO THAT KIND OF- TO

02:18:25.964 --> 02:18:26.564
COLLECT THAT KIND OF

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:27.799
SURVEILLANCE DATA IS GOING TO

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:31.302
BE CRITICAL. AND THE WAIVER SO.

02:18:31.369 --> 02:18:32.537
THE WAY WE'RE GONNA DO IT'S NOT

02:18:32.604 --> 02:18:33.471
WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOING

02:18:33.538 --> 02:18:35.073
AROUND AND RE COLLECTING ALL

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:37.075
THE DATA BUT HAVING SYSTEMS IN

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:39.144
PLACE. THAT ALLOW THE EXCHANGE

02:18:39.210 --> 02:18:40.645
OF INFORMATION IN AGGREGATE OR

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:42.414
OTHER WAYS HEALTH COURSE OF

02:18:42.480 --> 02:18:43.748
CERTAINLY MAINTAINING

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.183
INDIVIDUAL PATIENT PRIVACY BUT

02:18:45.250 --> 02:18:45.917
BE ON THE LOOK AT THINGS AND

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:47.652
AGATES WITH INFORMATION COMING

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:49.788
FROM OUR VARIOUS. NOW HEALTH

02:18:49.854 --> 02:18:51.489
PARTNERS RATE HOSPITALS HEALTH

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:52.991
SYSTEMS PHYSICIANS OTHER

02:18:53.058 --> 02:18:55.460
PROVIDERS ETCETERA. AND SO BE

02:18:55.527 --> 02:18:57.128
SURE ARE THE INFORMATION

02:18:57.195 --> 02:18:58.363
SYSTEMS WE'RE DEVELOPING AS

02:18:58.430 --> 02:18:59.397
WE'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP THESE

02:18:59.464 --> 02:19:01.032
EXCHANGES. THAT ALSO

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:03.268
INFORMATION CAN BE- THERE'S

02:19:03.334 --> 02:19:04.869
THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:05.804
IN A WAY THAT INFORMATION CAN

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:08.973
FLOW- TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND EVEN

02:19:09.040 --> 02:19:12.711
BACK- BACK AND FORTH- SO CAN

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:13.645
YOU SPEAK TO THAT. TO TALK

02:19:13.712 --> 02:19:16.047
ABOUT YOUR SPOT ON- I THINK

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:18.016
THAT. ONE OF THE EFFORTS AS

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:19.350
PART OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:20.719
REVIEW AND CONDUCTOR GALLEY

02:19:20.785 --> 02:19:23.588
SPOKE OF THIS YESTERDAY- IN IN

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:25.323
THE ASSEMBLY AND HE ALLUDED TO

02:19:25.390 --> 02:19:26.658
IT ALSO IN THE CONVERSATION

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.326
THAT HE HAD WITH. WITH THIS

02:19:28.393 --> 02:19:30.295
COMMITTEE EARLIER IN THE WEEK

02:19:30.361 --> 02:19:31.262
IS REALLY ASSESSING THE

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:32.764
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:34.232
PLATFORMS THAT WE CURRENTLY USE

02:19:34.299 --> 02:19:35.734
ON THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE. BUT I

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.102
THINK WHAT YOU'VE IDENTIFIED IS

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:38.470
THERE'S TWO PRINCIPLES THAT

02:19:38.536 --> 02:19:39.537
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THAT I THINK

02:19:39.604 --> 02:19:40.472
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO LIFT

02:19:40.538 --> 02:19:42.040
THAT BAN IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:19:42.107 --> 02:19:44.743
TO. I THINK- LEVERAGE HERE AS

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:45.376
PART OF THIS CONVERSATION FIRST

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:47.345
AND FOREMOST. ON THE PUBLIC

02:19:47.412 --> 02:19:48.913
OUTSIDE FROM A DISEASE

02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:50.949
SURVEILLANCEPERSPECTIVE WE'RE

02:19:51.015 --> 02:19:52.917
NOT ONLY FOCUSED ON INFECTIOUS

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:54.486
OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASES LIKE

02:19:54.552 --> 02:19:56.554
COVERT NINETEEN OR ZEKE OUR

02:19:56.621 --> 02:19:58.356
MEASLES. BUT LOOKING AT THE

02:19:58.423 --> 02:20:00.592
CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL AND WE

02:20:00.658 --> 02:20:01.893
HAVE A SERIES OF CLINICAL

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.495
REGISTRIES THAT PROVIDERS LIKE

02:20:03.561 --> 02:20:05.363
YOURSELF REPORT INTO. THE

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.031
CHALLENGE REALLY IS THE DATA

02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:08.767
THAT WE SENT BACK I SAY WHERE

02:20:08.833 --> 02:20:10.402
DATA RICH BUT INFORMATION POOR

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:12.203
WE COLLECT A LOT OF DATA BUT WE

02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:13.738
DO NOTHING WITH THAT. EITHER WE

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:15.073
DON'T PROVIDE IT BACK TO YOU AS

02:20:15.140 --> 02:20:16.307
A PROVIDER IN ORDER TO HELP

02:20:16.374 --> 02:20:17.876
FUEL YOUR POPULATION HEALTH

02:20:17.942 --> 02:20:19.911
MANAGEMENT TOOLS OR OTHER

02:20:19.978 --> 02:20:21.946
EFFORTS AROUND HOW YOU.

02:20:22.013 --> 02:20:23.448
BASICALLY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF

02:20:23.515 --> 02:20:24.749
THE POPULATION YOU'RE TRYING TO

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:26.451
SERVE NOR DO WE USE IT IN A

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:27.986
MORE ROBUST WAY TO THINK ABOUT

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:29.654
POLICY OR PROGRAM CHANGES STERN

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:31.556
FORMER THINKING. SO THERE'S TWO

02:20:31.623 --> 02:20:33.024
ASPECTS TO THIS ONE IS

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:35.460
INCREASING THE CONNECTIVITY OF

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:38.396
THOSE REGISTRIES. TO BE ABLE TO

02:20:38.463 --> 02:20:39.964
PUSH BACK THE INFORMATION TO

02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:42.033
THE PROVIDER. OR THE HEALTH

02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:43.735
CARE ENTITY IN ORDER FOR THEM

02:20:43.802 --> 02:20:45.170
TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:46.905
THEIR PATIENT POPULATION LOOKS

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:48.473
LIKE AND TRENDS THAT WERE SEEN.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:50.008
AS WELL AS THE LOCAL PUBLIC

02:20:50.074 --> 02:20:51.075
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER FOR

02:20:51.142 --> 02:20:52.243
THEM TO ENGAGE AFFECTED

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:54.279
COMMUNITY LEVEL. BUT IT'S ALSO

02:20:54.345 --> 02:20:56.381
IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE

02:20:56.447 --> 02:20:57.715
COLLECTIVELY WITH OTHER

02:20:57.782 --> 02:20:59.317
PARTNERS TO THINK ABOUT HOW

02:20:59.384 --> 02:21:01.219
THAT FUELS PROGRAM DESIGNED

02:21:01.286 --> 02:21:02.754
POLICY DESIGN AND RESEARCH

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:04.722
MOVING FORWARD TO HELP INFORM.

02:21:04.789 --> 02:21:06.724
CHANGES AND THIS IS WHERE I

02:21:06.791 --> 02:21:07.759
THINK OF BRINGING IN

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:09.427
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR ACADEMIC

02:21:09.494 --> 02:21:10.829
PARTNERS WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:21:10.895 --> 02:21:14.265
CONVERSATIONS. AROUND A

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:15.266
RESEARCH DATA HAVE REALLY NEDS

02:21:15.333 --> 02:21:16.367
TO LINK BOTH THE CALL. AND DATA

02:21:16.434 --> 02:21:17.302
WHAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW WHEN

02:21:17.368 --> 02:21:19.003
RESEARCHERS GET OUR DATA WE

02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:20.605
DON'T REALLY LOOK AT RESULTS OR

02:21:20.672 --> 02:21:21.873
WE DON'T GET A SENSE OF WHAT

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.308
THE RESULTS ARE. OF THE

02:21:23.374 --> 02:21:25.376
RESEARCH TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

02:21:25.443 --> 02:21:26.744
YEARS DOWN THE ROAD AND MOST

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:27.946
OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN IT'S

02:21:28.012 --> 02:21:29.781
PUBLISHED IN ACADEMIC PAPERS

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:31.015
CAN WE ACCELERATE THAT

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:32.750
PARTNERSHIP AND BE ABLE TO.

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.485
HAVE OUR STATE WORKFORCE CO

02:21:34.552 --> 02:21:36.788
CREATE WITH ACADEMICS TO BE

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:38.656
ABLE TO IN REAL TIME GET A

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:40.291
SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

02:21:40.358 --> 02:21:41.426
THE DATA TO INFORM POLICY

02:21:41.492 --> 02:21:43.094
MAKING. IN ORDER FOR US TO

02:21:43.161 --> 02:21:43.862
IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.430
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND THIS

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:46.998
IS EXACTLY THE- KIND OF THAT

02:21:47.065 --> 02:21:48.500
THE ACADEMY OF WHAT WE'RE

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:50.835
TRYING TO DO WITH THIS WORK

02:21:50.902 --> 02:21:52.503
WITH THE H. ID. SO I APPRECIATE

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.038
THAT AND HAVING BEEN FORMALLY A

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:55.974
FACULTY MEMBER AT- DINNERS THE

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:58.209
CALIFORNIA DAVIS AND- DOING

02:21:58.276 --> 02:21:59.677
HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH SO I

02:21:59.744 --> 02:22:01.746
WAS ONE OF THOSE DATA PEOPLE.

02:22:01.813 --> 02:22:03.114
LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE LARGE

02:22:03.181 --> 02:22:05.617
DATASETS- BUT YOU GET SO I

02:22:05.683 --> 02:22:08.119
WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT- I HOPE.

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:10.221
THAT AS WERE- DOING THE BUDGET

02:22:10.288 --> 02:22:11.422
WE HAVE STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE

02:22:11.489 --> 02:22:14.259
ADMINISTRATION FOR ACTUALLY- SO

02:22:14.325 --> 02:22:15.593
I KNOW YOU HAVE PROPOSALS FOR

02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.395
THIS COMING YEAR FOR LIKE THREE

02:22:17.462 --> 02:22:19.564
MILLION ON THOSE. C. P. H. AND

02:22:19.631 --> 02:22:21.332
HERE WE HAVE. TWO AND A HALF

02:22:21.399 --> 02:22:23.001
MILLION BUT THEN FORGOT REALLY

02:22:23.067 --> 02:22:24.469
SERIOUS ABOUT BUILDING OUT THE

02:22:24.535 --> 02:22:26.271
SYSTEMS TENWE SHOULD BE

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:26.838
HAVING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

02:22:26.905 --> 02:22:29.107
RESERVE HELD. BUDGETED IN DOUBT

02:22:29.173 --> 02:22:30.408
AND WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS

02:22:30.475 --> 02:22:31.776
YEAR IN THE OUT YEARS TO

02:22:31.843 --> 02:22:33.044
ACTUALLY BUILD THE SYSTEM SO WE

02:22:33.111 --> 02:22:34.412
CAN STUDY THEM BUT IF WE ARE

02:22:34.479 --> 02:22:35.813
NOT HOLDING RESOURCES TO BE

02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:39.350
ABLE TO BUILD THEM OUT- THEN-

02:22:39.417 --> 02:22:41.119
IT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION BUT-

02:22:41.185 --> 02:22:42.287
AND WE DO HAVE BE GREAT

02:22:42.353 --> 02:22:45.857
ASSESSMENT. SO IS THAT THE

02:22:45.924 --> 02:22:47.792
INTENTION ADMINISTRATION THEN.

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:49.861
CENTER I MEAN I THINK THAT TO

02:22:49.928 --> 02:22:51.596
DOCTOR GALLEYS POINT EARLIER

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:52.764
THIS WEEK THE INTENT OF THE

02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:54.332
ADMINISTRATION IS REALLY TO

02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:55.400
LEVERAGE THE THREE MILLION ON

02:22:55.466 --> 02:22:56.734
THE PUBLIC OUTSIDE TO HAVE A

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.169
CONVERSATION WITH OUR LOCAL

02:22:58.236 --> 02:22:59.637
PARTNERS TO ASSESS THE GAPS AND

02:22:59.704 --> 02:23:01.873
BETTER UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE GO

02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:03.107
I THINK THE INTENT OF THE

02:23:03.174 --> 02:23:04.375
ADMINISTRATION IS TO COME BACK

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:06.210
IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT'S

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:07.178
PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:23:07.245 --> 02:23:09.213
TO MAP OUT. IN MORE EARNEST

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:11.082
SOME OF THE PIECES AND PUT

02:23:11.149 --> 02:23:12.417
FORWARD ADDITIONAL FUNDING

02:23:12.483 --> 02:23:14.385
REQUEST WHAT. AROUND THE SPACE

02:23:14.452 --> 02:23:15.620
THE ONLY THING I WILL ADD HERE

02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:16.788
IS THAT WE'VE MADE SOME

02:23:16.854 --> 02:23:18.156
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WITH

02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:19.791
FEDERAL DOLLARS BOTH THE ERC

02:23:19.857 --> 02:23:21.225
GRANT AND OTHER FEDERAL DOLLARS

02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:23.428
THAT WE RECEIVED. TO BUILD OUT

02:23:23.494 --> 02:23:24.996
THESE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ON THE

02:23:25.063 --> 02:23:26.531
PUBLIC OUTSIDE I THINK THE

02:23:26.597 --> 02:23:28.166
CONVERSATION WILL BE AROUND HOW

02:23:28.232 --> 02:23:29.567
WE CONTINUE TO FIND SOME OF

02:23:29.634 --> 02:23:30.735
THOSE PIECES AND WHAT WE

02:23:30.802 --> 02:23:33.004
CONTINUE TO LEFT UP. THAT WE'VE

02:23:33.071 --> 02:23:34.806
ACCELERATED AND BELTS DURING

02:23:34.872 --> 02:23:36.474
THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC.

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.276
OKAY WELL LET'S WAS I HAVING

02:23:38.343 --> 02:23:39.877
BEEN. ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.145
FOR A FEW YEARS AND SEEN MANY

02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:43.381
IT PROJECTS I DON'T SOUND TOO

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:46.250
MANY THAT- THAT WERE ONLY GET

02:23:46.317 --> 02:23:48.886
FOR A FEW MILLION- AND- SO I

02:23:48.953 --> 02:23:49.754
ALREADY KNOW YOU KNOW JUST FROM

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:51.856
A SKILL STANDPOINT. I THINK YOU

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:53.291
KNOW. IF WE'RE EVER BEING

02:23:53.358 --> 02:23:54.792
REALLY HONEST WITH OURSELVES.

02:23:54.859 --> 02:23:56.961
AND IS THIS A DEDICATION OF THE

02:23:57.028 --> 02:23:59.530
ABSENT AND ISSUES. IS MORE THAN

02:23:59.597 --> 02:24:00.465
JUST IDENTIFICATION W'RE GOING

02:24:00.531 --> 02:24:02.133
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THEN

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.935
WE DO NEED TO THINK AS WE YOU

02:24:04.002 --> 02:24:05.370
KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE PASS A BUDGET

02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:06.904
A YEAR AT A TIME BUT IN TERMS

02:24:06.971 --> 02:24:08.439
OF LOOKING AT OUT YEARS. WE

02:24:08.506 --> 02:24:10.408
SHOULD DEFINITELY BE. CHECKED I

02:24:10.475 --> 02:24:12.210
COMMIT THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE

02:24:12.276 --> 02:24:13.544
KIND OF COMMITMENTS WE HAVE TO

02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:14.612
MAKE IN ORDER TO ACTUALLY

02:24:14.679 --> 02:24:16.614
FOLLOW THROUGH. AND WHILE WE

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:18.416
MAY NOT KNOW THE EXACT AMOUNTS.

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:20.718
I CERTAINLY- I CAN YOU KNOW

02:24:20.785 --> 02:24:21.719
THINK PAST EXPERIENCE CAN

02:24:21.786 --> 02:24:23.121
CERTAINLY TO HELP US ESTIMATE

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.856
AT LEAST THE SKILL OF FUNDS

02:24:24.922 --> 02:24:26.090
THAT WE MIGHT WILL PROBABLY

02:24:26.157 --> 02:24:28.693
NEED TO. ENSURE THAT. WE'RE

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.261
WE'RE WE'RE BUILDING IN TO MAKE

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:32.130
THIS HAPPEN OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT

02:24:32.196 --> 02:24:34.532
BEING REALISTIC ABOUT IT RIGHT-

02:24:34.599 --> 02:24:37.702
SO I DEBTS. SO HOPEFULLY- YOU

02:24:37.769 --> 02:24:38.369
KNOW THAT'S PART OF THE

02:24:38.436 --> 02:24:39.771
CONVERSATION OUT AGAIN I THINK

02:24:39.837 --> 02:24:40.805
SIMILARLY FOR THE FIGHT TO SAVE

02:24:40.872 --> 02:24:42.673
THE PREVIOUS ITEM AS WELL I'M

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:48.312
NOT SURE THE ASSESSMENTS NESTLE.

02:24:48.379 --> 02:24:49.514
TAKE A WHOLE FISCAL YEAR. I

02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:50.081
MEAN CERTAIN CERTAIN TO ME.

02:24:50.148 --> 02:24:50.982
DIFFER PIECES AND PARTS SO WE

02:24:51.049 --> 02:24:51.749
CAN ALSO GET A HEAD START ON

02:24:51.816 --> 02:24:52.884
SOME OF THE-THINGS. AS WE- TO

02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:54.352
GET. MOVING BUT I GUESS ON THIS

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:55.620
PARTICULAR ISSUE I JUST WANNA

02:24:55.686 --> 02:24:57.055
BE SURE THAT AS WE'RE- BUILDING

02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:59.457
OUT THE STANDARDS AND- SO FORTH

02:24:59.524 --> 02:25:00.458
FOR OUR HEALTH INFORMATION

02:25:00.525 --> 02:25:01.793
EXCHANGES WE ARE PUTTING BE

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.394
SURE WE ESTABLISH STANDARDS

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:05.363
THAT ALLOW US. TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:25:05.430 --> 02:25:06.831
THIS KIND OF SAID DISEASE

02:25:06.898 --> 02:25:08.699
SURVEILLANCE- CRYING DISEASE

02:25:08.766 --> 02:25:10.368
ETCETERA. THAT THOSE STANDARDS

02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:11.769
ARE GOING TO BE IN PLACE SO WE

02:25:11.836 --> 02:25:13.037
HAVE THE POSSIBILITY AND THEN

02:25:13.104 --> 02:25:14.439
WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON

02:25:14.505 --> 02:25:15.540
THAT POSSIBILITY INTERNET

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.942
REALITY WITH RESOURCES. AND

02:25:18.009 --> 02:25:19.744
WHETHER IT'S LATER THIS NEXT

02:25:19.811 --> 02:25:22.713

YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND

03:08:24.326 --> 03:08:24.860
ON THIS WHAT I WOULD SAY AND I

03:08:24.926 --> 03:08:26.628
KNOW WE'VE BEEN THIS. PROPOSAL

03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:28.330
IF YOU WILL BUT- AND I THINK

03:08:28.397 --> 03:08:29.665
WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

03:08:29.731 --> 03:08:30.932
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS STILL

03:08:30.999 --> 03:08:32.968
A WORK IN PROGRESS AND- I WAS

03:08:33.035 --> 03:08:34.336
GOING TO SAY. ALSO THAT I HAVE

03:08:34.403 --> 03:08:36.772
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCHOOL

03:08:36.838 --> 03:08:38.940
COMPONENT IN THE- INSIDE OF

03:08:39.007 --> 03:08:40.242
COMPONENT WHEN THEY'RE WE HAVE

03:08:40.308 --> 03:08:41.610
A PROPOSALS VERY SIMILAR TO

03:08:41.677 --> 03:08:43.645
THAT. AND HOW ALL OF THESE

03:08:43.712 --> 03:08:44.880
THINGS ARE GONNA WORK THROUGH

03:08:44.946 --> 03:08:46.615
IT. I THINK WE'RE ALL INTRIGUED

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:49.051
WITH THE IDEA OF A OF A BIG-

03:08:49.117 --> 03:08:51.386
PLATFORM- AS THE BACKBONE OF A

03:08:51.453 --> 03:08:53.989
OF A OF A SYSTEM- BUT THEN YOU

03:08:54.056 --> 03:08:55.991
ALSO HAVE TO THINK IT'LL IS IT

03:08:56.058 --> 03:08:56.625
LIKE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL RIGHT

03:08:56.692 --> 03:08:57.759
DO WE JUST WILL DO WE BUILD

03:08:57.826 --> 03:08:59.261
THAT TRACK FIRST OR DO WE BUILD

03:08:59.327 --> 03:09:00.162
ALL THE ARTERIES THAT WOULD

03:09:00.228 --> 03:09:01.697
LEAD INTO IT FIRST BECAUSE-

03:09:01.763 --> 03:09:02.831
PEOPLE CALL INTO SOMETHING

03:09:02.898 --> 03:09:04.299
THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING THAT.

03:09:04.366 --> 03:09:06.301
ON THE GROUND FOR THEM THEM TO

03:09:06.368 --> 03:09:08.003
BE REFERRED TO. AND THEN I

03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.837
THINK WHAT WE'VE ALL OF

03:09:08.904 --> 03:09:09.838
KNOWLEDGE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

03:09:09.905 --> 03:09:11.673
RESOURCES IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.

03:09:11.740 --> 03:09:14.276
R. FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- SO I

03:09:14.342 --> 03:09:15.777
THINK YOU KNOW I GET THAT THIS

03:09:15.844 --> 03:09:17.179
IS NOT FULLY ALTHOUGH FOR US

03:09:17.245 --> 03:09:19.681
OUT. CAN WE GET THE FULL. WILL

03:09:19.748 --> 03:09:21.717
BE ABLE TO EVALUATE IT BETTER

03:09:21.783 --> 03:09:22.651
BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME

03:09:22.718 --> 03:09:23.919
CONCERNS ABOUT SOME

03:09:23.985 --> 03:09:25.620
REDUNDANCIES- AND AGAIN THE

03:09:25.687 --> 03:09:27.789

OUR HANDS RIGHT. AND WITH SOME

03:09:29.157 --> 03:09:30.792

PEDIATRICIAN EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

03:11:38.887 --> 03:11:40.789
THE- GOT EXTRA TRAINING- IN

03:11:40.856 --> 03:11:43.091
ADDITION. THESE PATIENTS TAKE

03:11:43.158 --> 03:11:45.293
MORE TIME- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T%

03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:46.628

THE PATIENT AND THE FAMILIES

03:11:50.999 --> 03:11:53.969
AND SO FORTH. ARE WE GOING TO

03:11:54.035 --> 03:11:55.403
THINK ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT

03:11:55.470 --> 03:11:58.907
STRUCTURE. OUR OUR OUR- AND

03:11:58.974 --> 03:12:00.041
ALSO IN INDIA WE'RE GOING TO

03:12:00.108 --> 03:12:01.276
PLAN RICK PROCUREMENT AND ALL

03:12:01.343 --> 03:12:02.410
THIS OTHER STUFF SO TO BE SURE

03:12:02.477 --> 03:12:05.280
THAT. THE WAY THE PLANS PAY THE

03:12:05.347 --> 03:12:06.114
PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS WHO

03:12:06.181 --> 03:12:07.482
ACTUALLY SPENDING THE TIME

03:12:07.549 --> 03:12:09.818
DOING THE YOU KNOW MODERATE.

03:12:09.885 --> 03:12:11.453
MENTAL HEALTH THAT DAY

03:12:11.519 --> 03:12:15.323
ACTUALLY- COURAGE TO DO THAT

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:16.524
AND SO. TO THAT FOR. A EVEN

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:19.194
THOUGH THE SKILLS. MY PAYMENT

03:12:19.261 --> 03:12:21.463
SYSTEM IS IN A WAY THAT. MEANS

03:12:21.529 --> 03:12:22.731
THAT I'M GONNA REFERRAL THESE

03:12:22.797 --> 03:12:23.632
PEOPLE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO

03:12:23.698 --> 03:12:24.833
TAKE CARE OF THE ONES I CAN

03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:25.834
TAKE CARE OF MYSELF BECAUSE

03:12:25.901 --> 03:12:26.968
BASICALLY THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE

03:12:27.035 --> 03:12:28.803
DOESN'T REWARD. SPENDING THAT

03:12:28.870 --> 03:12:30.205
KIND OF TIME. SOZOMEN SOME

03:12:30.272 --> 03:12:32.274
THOUGHT INDEED CS ABOUT. THAT

03:12:32.340 --> 03:12:34.509
ASPECT AGAIN EXTEND OUR WORK

03:12:34.576 --> 03:12:36.578
FORCE EXTEND OUR CAPACITY. TO

03:12:36.645 --> 03:12:38.613
TAKE CARE OF. CHILDREN WHO HAVE

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:41.049
MILD TO MODERATE ALBEIT FOR

03:12:41.116 --> 03:12:43.218
HEALTH ISSUES. I THINK THERE'S

03:12:43.285 --> 03:12:44.786
KIND OF TWO MAIN COMPONENTS

03:12:44.853 --> 03:12:46.054
WITHIN THE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD

03:12:46.121 --> 03:12:49.257
STOP POTENTIALLY SPEAK TO. SOME

03:12:49.324 --> 03:12:49.791
OF THE POINTS THAT YOU'RE

03:12:49.858 --> 03:12:50.992
RAISING THE FIRST ONE IS. OF

03:12:51.059 --> 03:12:53.261
THE ADDITIONAL MEDIC CAL DYADIC

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:55.263
SERVICES BENEFITS THAT IS THE

03:12:55.330 --> 03:12:57.299
ADDITION OF CODES THAT WOULD

03:12:57.365 --> 03:12:59.167
ALLOW FOR MORE ABOUT INTEGRATED

03:12:59.234 --> 03:13:00.568
SERVICE TO BE HAPPENING WITHIN

03:13:00.635 --> 03:13:02.037
THE PRIMARY CARE. FOR PEDIATRIC

03:13:02.103 --> 03:13:04.539
OFFICE WHERE ADDITIONAL CODES-

03:13:04.606 --> 03:13:06.308
AND RATES TIED TO THEM WOULD BE

03:13:06.374 --> 03:13:08.576
A BILLABLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT

03:13:08.643 --> 03:13:09.477
FOR THOSE TYPES OF INTEGRATED

03:13:09.544 --> 03:13:11.079
SERVICES WHERE YOU'RE DOING.

03:13:11.146 --> 03:13:12.480
THE MULTI SAYS MEN ARE HEADING

03:13:12.547 --> 03:13:13.882
OFF TO A SOCIAL WORKER WITH AN

03:13:13.949 --> 03:13:14.683
OFFICE IF THAT'S SOMETHING

03:13:14.749 --> 03:13:16.418
THAT'S AVAILABLE I'M IN

03:13:16.484 --> 03:13:18.320
ALLOWING FOR THOSE SERVICES TO

03:13:18.386 --> 03:13:20.021
BE BUILT- WITHIN THAT THAT

03:13:20.088 --> 03:13:21.856
PLATFORM WE'RE HOPING TO GET

03:13:21.923 --> 03:13:22.457
SOME INFORMATION OUT REGARDING

03:13:22.524 --> 03:13:24.826
THAT- DYADIC SERVICES. A NEW

03:13:24.893 --> 03:13:27.228
BENEFIT CODES AND DESCRIPTIONS

03:13:27.295 --> 03:13:27.796
OF THE PEOPLE OF AN

03:13:27.862 --> 03:13:28.630
UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE

03:13:28.697 --> 03:13:29.731
TALKING ABOUT BUT IT'S QUITE

03:13:29.798 --> 03:13:31.566
COMPREHENSIVE IN REGARDS TO

03:13:31.633 --> 03:13:33.501
YOU- REALLY PUSHING THE NEEDLE.

03:13:33.568 --> 03:13:34.602
INTEGRATED APPROACH AND

03:13:34.669 --> 03:13:36.604
ALLOWING FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT.

03:13:36.671 --> 03:13:38.974
OF THOSE SERVICES- SO I THINK

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:39.541
THAT WOULD BE THE ONE PIECE

03:13:39.607 --> 03:13:41.476
THAT POINT OUT NOT SPECIFIC TO

03:13:41.543 --> 03:13:42.243
MEDICARE MOST OF THE CHILDREN

03:13:42.310 --> 03:13:45.013
AND YOUTH IS ALL PAYER AS YOUR

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:45.880
TO TWENTY FIVE HOWEVER THAT ONE

03:13:45.947 --> 03:13:47.816
PORTION IS FOR MEDIC CAL. A

03:13:47.882 --> 03:13:49.551
BENEFIT PIECES ON THE DYADIC

03:13:49.617 --> 03:13:50.652
CARE SERVICES AND THEN THE

03:13:50.719 --> 03:13:52.387
OTHER PIECE WAS- DEPARTMENT

03:13:52.454 --> 03:13:54.522
SHOULD EARLIER IS FOR PRIMARY

03:13:54.589 --> 03:13:56.024
CARE PROVIDERS I'M SURE WANTING

03:13:56.091 --> 03:13:58.159
SOME A CONSULTATION THERE WOULD

03:13:58.226 --> 03:13:59.995
BE AND YOU CONSOLE. I TIED TO

03:14:00.061 --> 03:14:00.929
THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WHERE THEY

03:14:00.996 --> 03:14:02.797
WOULD BE ABLE TO MAYBE GET SOME

03:14:02.864 --> 03:14:04.666
CONSULTATION WITH- A

03:14:04.733 --> 03:14:07.035
PSYCHIATRIC EXPERT- TO BE ABLE

03:14:07.102 --> 03:14:08.937
TO INFORM. OF AND BUILD THOSE

03:14:09.004 --> 03:14:10.405
PIECES BUT AS YOU MENTIONED IT

03:14:10.472 --> 03:14:11.740
WASN'T NECESSARILY SO MUCH ON

03:14:11.806 --> 03:14:12.874
THE TRAINING SIDE BUT I JUST

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:14.242
DID WANT TO MENTION THAT. I

03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:15.477
THINK THE BIGGEST PART THAT

03:14:15.543 --> 03:14:16.644
WORK CONSIDERING THAT WOULD BE

03:14:16.711 --> 03:14:18.346
A BILLABLE- ON BEHALF OF

03:14:18.413 --> 03:14:20.482
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WOULD BE

03:14:20.548 --> 03:14:21.950
THOSE DYADIC CARE SERVICES. SO

03:14:22.017 --> 03:14:23.718
I GUESS SIR FIRST OF ALL. I

03:14:23.785 --> 03:14:25.387
APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

03:14:25.453 --> 03:14:27.288
TRY TO PROVIDE MORE E. TONSILS

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:27.922
FROM MENTAL HEALTH

03:14:27.989 --> 03:14:28.957
PROFESSIONALS TO PRIMARY CARE

03:14:29.024 --> 03:14:31.126
SITES SO WHEN THAT DOES BE PAID

03:14:31.192 --> 03:14:32.227
FOR SO THAT'S GOOD I'M ALSO

03:14:32.293 --> 03:14:33.261
TALKING ABOUT THE PRIMARY CARE

03:14:33.328 --> 03:14:34.729
DOCTORS BECAUSE WE EVEN HAVE A

03:14:34.796 --> 03:14:35.930
COMPONENT. I KNOW IT'S ON THE

03:14:35.997 --> 03:14:37.032
HOT SPOT SIDE THE TRAIN PRIMARY

03:14:37.098 --> 03:14:38.466
CARE DOCTORS TO DO MORE MENTAL

03:14:38.533 --> 03:14:44.572
HEALTH ON THEIR OWN RIGHT.

03:14:44.639 --> 03:14:45.507
GIVEN THAT KIND OF TRAINING- TO

03:14:45.573 --> 03:14:46.641
BE ABLE TO THE BILL BACK TO PAY.

03:14:46.708 --> 03:14:49.110
AND- BUT- THAT THAT WILL BE

03:14:49.177 --> 03:14:50.378
THAT EFFORT ALSO IN CARE TO

03:14:50.445 --> 03:14:51.980
BEING TO MANAGE MORE WHICH

03:14:52.047 --> 03:14:53.548
WOULD AND DEPRESSURIZED THE

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:55.250
AMOUNT OF REFERRALS TO ARE

03:14:55.316 --> 03:14:57.752
STILL. ARE SORT OF CONSTRAINED

03:14:57.819 --> 03:15:00.288
MENTAL. HEALTH WORKFORCE AND

03:15:00.355 --> 03:15:02.891
THAT WE HAVE- REIMBURSEMENTS

HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:29:06.133 --> 03:29:07.201
IT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT. JUST

03:29:07.268 --> 03:29:08.502
ENOUGH TO BUILD THEM AND THEY

THE MOVE FROM STATE HOSPITALS

03:29:50.010 --> 03:29:52.046
AT THAT IS GOING TO. PUT EVEN

03:29:52.112 --> 03:29:53.180
MORE PRESSURE ON THE SYSTEM.

03:29:53.247 --> 03:29:54.481

OVERWHELM THEM SO THEN WHEN WE

03:31:26.840 --> 03:31:28.575
THINK ABOUT THIS PIECE NOW WHAT

03:31:28.642 --> 03:31:29.843
IS A STAFFING RIGHT SO WE'RE

PRIVATE FOR THE PRIMARY CARE

03:31:38.185 --> 03:31:39.086
PRACTICE HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY

03:31:39.153 --> 03:31:40.754
NEED TO STAFF THESE FACILITIES.

03:31:40.821 --> 03:31:43.657
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT MAPPING

03:31:43.724 --> 03:31:44.925
THAT OUT OF BED TO BE SURE WE

03:31:44.992 --> 03:31:46.994

HOW WE MAXIMIZE THE WORK FORCE

03:31:49.763 --> 03:31:51.999
AND THE VARIOUS RESOURCES WE

03:31:52.066 --> 03:31:54.168
HAVE TO DO TO DO THAT SO I

03:31:54.234 --> 03:31:55.369
THINK THE MAIN GATE THE NAME

03:31:55.436 --> 03:31:57.171
WAS A SPEAKING PERHAPS A LARGER

03:31:57.237 --> 03:31:59.406
PROPOSAL RIGHT AND WHERE WHERE

03:31:59.473 --> 03:32:01.008
WHERE THE RESOURCE IS MOST

03:32:01.075 --> 03:32:01.742
NEEDED IN TERMS OF THE

03:32:01.809 --> 03:32:03.310
BOTTLENECKS IN ONE THE OTHER

03:32:03.377 --> 03:32:04.678
CHALLENGES PERHAPS IS THAT IT

03:32:04.745 --> 03:32:06.613
AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR BILL

03:32:06.680 --> 03:32:07.281
THE STATE'S PRETTY FOR THE

03:32:07.347 --> 03:32:08.615
MONEY BUT AS I THINK IS L. L.

03:32:08.682 --> 03:32:11.452
POINTED OUT. THAT THE LOCAL IS-

03:32:11.518 --> 03:32:13.253
COUNTY IF YOU'VE DEPEND ON THE

03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:15.022
LOCAL PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THE ON

03:32:15.089 --> 03:32:17.758
GOING OUT YOU KNOW OPERATIONS

03:32:17.825 --> 03:32:18.692
QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO FIGHT OR

03:32:18.759 --> 03:32:27.167
NOT OR TO GO BE. WILLING TO DO

03:32:27.234 --> 03:32:27.768
THAT OR NOT- THERE'S EVEN LOW

03:32:27.835 --> 03:32:28.402
CATION ISSUES RIGHT. THEN FOR.

03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:30.471
AND I. HATE TO SAY THIS BUT-

03:32:30.537 --> 03:32:32.406
NICE AS- TIME. WHEN SOMEONE'S

03:32:32.473 --> 03:32:33.207
FOR. TO BUILD MEDICAL THIS. AND

03:32:33.273 --> 03:32:34.141
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THAT AREA.

03:32:34.208 --> 03:32:35.676
WANT IT- THERE AND- FOR EVEN

03:32:35.742 --> 03:32:37.311
FINDING LOCATION. AND SO FOR.

03:32:37.377 --> 03:32:38.579
MAYBE A CHALLENGE FOR SOME

03:32:38.645 --> 03:32:41.748
CERTAIN AREAS AS WELL. AND YOU

03:32:41.815 --> 03:32:43.317
KNOW- SO WE COULD IF WE COULD

03:32:43.383 --> 03:32:45.152
END UP WITH A SITUATION WHERE.

03:32:45.219 --> 03:32:47.421
WELL ON BECAUSE THE LOCALS HAVE

03:32:47.488 --> 03:32:48.522
TO COMMIT TO PROVIDE THE THIRTY

03:32:48.589 --> 03:32:50.557
YEARS OF SERVICE ETCETERA. AND

03:32:50.624 --> 03:32:52.059
THAT BECOMES THE EXCUSE FOR

03:32:52.126 --> 03:32:54.428
CERTAIN AREAS ACTUALLY DECLINED

03:32:54.495 --> 03:32:57.030
BECAUSE- THE REAL REASON IS

03:32:57.097 --> 03:32:58.065
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN THAT

03:32:58.132 --> 03:33:00.200
COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE

03:33:00.267 --> 03:33:02.503
UNDUE OUR AND- NOW. THEY DON'T

03:33:02.569 --> 03:33:04.004
WANT A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY

03:33:04.071 --> 03:33:07.875
IN YOUR AREA RIGHT. AND THEN

03:33:07.941 --> 03:33:08.408
WHAT HAPPENS IS WE HAVE TO

03:33:08.475 --> 03:33:08.942
DISTRIBUTE YOU KNOW WE THE

03:33:09.009 --> 03:33:10.177
DISTRIBUTION OF THESE- THAT WE-

03:33:10.244 --> 03:33:12.312
THE FUND. TURNS DOESN'T. MATCH

03:33:12.379 --> 03:33:14.181
THE- DEMAND TO NEED OR DESIRE

03:33:14.248 --> 03:33:14.781
DAY DON'T ADDRESS THE EQUITY

03:33:14.848 --> 03:33:16.049
ISSUES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE

03:33:16.116 --> 03:33:18.685
THINGS LIKE THAT SO- SO. THESE

03:33:18.752 --> 03:33:20.053
ARE NOT ALL THINGS THE REASONS

03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:21.555
TO SAY NO TO THIS BUT THESE ARE

03:33:21.622 --> 03:33:23.023
THINGS THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO

03:33:23.090 --> 03:33:24.391
HAVE SOME ANSWERS ABOUT HOW

03:33:24.458 --> 03:33:25.259
WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT DOING

03:33:25.325 --> 03:33:26.226
THIS HOW WHAT KIND OF

03:33:26.293 --> 03:33:27.928
INCENTIVES. AND ARE WE JUST AND

03:33:27.995 --> 03:33:29.196
OTHER THAN THAT WE DISTRIBUTE

03:33:29.263 --> 03:33:30.464
THE RESOURCES ARE PROBABLY L.

03:33:30.531 --> 03:33:32.332
IS THIS THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO PUT

03:33:32.399 --> 03:33:33.967
ON THE BRICK MORTAR SIDE. IS

03:33:34.034 --> 03:33:35.102
THE AMOUNTS ARE BEING PROPOSED

THE RELEASE OF THE FISCAL

04:11:42.754 --> 04:11:44.155
ESTIMATE WOULD BE IMPORTANT FOR

04:11:44.222 --> 04:11:45.457
THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AN

04:11:45.523 --> 04:11:46.391

PERMANENT BASIS REMAINS.

04:12:06.611 --> 04:12:09.314
PREMATURE ONE OPTION THAT THE

04:12:09.380 --> 04:12:10.715

WHERE NEEDED. OKAY THERE'S A

04:12:44.015 --> 04:12:45.984
THAT THAT SUNSET MAKES A MAKES

04:12:46.050 --> 04:12:47.452
A LOT OF SENSE TO ME I THINK

04:12:47.519 --> 04:12:49.320
WHEN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE

04:12:49.387 --> 04:12:50.255
ALL WE'RE STILL FINDING OUT SO

04:12:50.321 --> 04:12:53.024
MUCH. ABOUT TELEHEALTH AND THE

04:12:53.091 --> 04:12:55.860
EFFECTIVENESS AND THE ISSUES

04:12:55.927 --> 04:12:58.363
AROUND ACCESS- AS FAR AS IT

04:12:58.429 --> 04:13:00.598
RELATES TO TECHNOLOGY- AND I

04:13:00.665 --> 04:13:02.267
KNOW WHAT THE CLINICS HAVE NOT

04:13:02.333 --> 04:13:04.536
BEEN PLEASED BUT- ALSO WE ARE

04:13:04.602 --> 04:13:05.870
ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT. THAT

04:13:05.937 --> 04:13:08.139
THE GOVERNOR HEARD THE

04:13:08.206 --> 04:13:09.107
MINISTRATION HEARD LOUD AND

04:13:09.173 --> 04:13:10.508
CLEAR AFTER JANUARY PROPOSAL

04:13:10.575 --> 04:13:12.744
THAT- THAT IT PROBABLY WASN'T

04:13:12.810 --> 04:13:13.945
GOOD TO JUST TAKE OUT AUDIO ALL

04:13:14.012 --> 04:13:16.614
THE WAY- BUT WE'RE STILL NOT AT

04:13:16.681 --> 04:13:17.682
AT PARITY WITH THAT SO I THINK

04:13:17.749 --> 04:13:19.784
THESE THAT THAT'LL BE A TOPIC

04:13:19.851 --> 04:13:21.586
FOR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS. BUT

04:13:21.653 --> 04:13:24.155
I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF A SUNSET

04:13:24.222 --> 04:13:28.326
DR PAN. YEAH IT'S- POLICY THIS.

04:13:28.393 --> 04:13:29.761
IS BETTER THAN WAS ORIGINALLY

04:13:29.827 --> 04:13:31.296
POSE FOR WE DON'T HAVE AUDIO

04:13:31.362 --> 04:13:36.734
BUT I I'M I'M CONCERNED THIS-

04:13:36.801 --> 04:13:38.703
DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH- FOR A

04:13:38.770 --> 04:13:41.940
COUPLE REASONS- YOU KNOW- SO

04:13:42.006 --> 04:13:43.374
MOST OF POORLY ACTUALLY IS AN

04:13:43.441 --> 04:13:46.311
ACCESS ISSUE- WE KNOW THAT.

04:13:46.377 --> 04:13:48.313
DURING CODED BUT EATEN WHAT WE

04:13:48.379 --> 04:13:49.948
LEARNED FROM THE CALL THAT I

04:13:50.014 --> 04:13:52.884
SHOULD SAY IS THAT- THAT.

04:13:52.951 --> 04:13:55.186
PEOPLE HELP- WE HAVE RIGHT

04:13:55.253 --> 04:13:56.387
ACCESS AS SHE IN SOME WAYS

04:13:56.454 --> 04:13:58.222
BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE

04:13:58.289 --> 04:14:01.225
AUDIO- TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE-

04:14:01.292 --> 04:14:01.960
PARTICULAR PEOPLE ARE

04:14:02.026 --> 04:14:03.595
VULNERABLE RIGHT IN THAT IT

04:14:03.661 --> 04:14:04.162
ACTUALLY PEOPLE POINTED OUT

04:14:04.228 --> 04:14:05.630
WHAT WE'RE DOING TELEHEALTH HOW

04:14:05.697 --> 04:14:07.532
IMPORTANT WAS THAT WE INCLUDED

04:14:07.599 --> 04:14:08.666
AUDIO ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

04:14:08.733 --> 04:14:11.069

TELEHEALTH AND- IT ENDED UP AND

04:14:14.839 --> 04:14:16.674
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EQUIPMENT

04:14:16.741 --> 04:14:17.809
AT THE PROVIDER AND IT'S A

04:14:17.875 --> 04:14:18.910
MEDICAL AT THE EQUIPMENT THAT

04:14:18.977 --> 04:14:20.511
THE PERSON HAS AT THE OTHER END

04:14:20.578 --> 04:14:22.046
RIGHT- AND WHAT THEY HAVE

04:14:22.113 --> 04:14:24.182
AVAILABLE BUT ALSO IT HAS TO DO

04:14:24.248 --> 04:14:25.750
WITH THINGS LIKE PRIVACY. RIGHT

04:14:25.817 --> 04:14:27.819

THINGS LIKE THAT GREAT SO-

04:14:49.040 --> 04:14:50.375
AUDIO ONLY GIVES YOU MORE TOOLS

04:14:50.441 --> 04:14:51.876
AND ALSO IMPROVE PRIVACY

04:14:51.943 --> 04:14:54.078
ACCESS. AND WE LEARNED THAT

04:14:54.145 --> 04:14:56.414
DURING COLD AND SO WE'RE KIND

04:14:56.481 --> 04:14:57.782
OF DISCOURAGING THAT NOW THAT

04:14:57.849 --> 04:14:59.751
KIND OF ACCESS. THE OTHER PART

04:14:59.817 --> 04:15:01.519
IS PERHAPS MORE VOTES LONG

04:15:01.586 --> 04:15:03.688
STANDING- BUT GREAT ABOUT AND

04:15:03.755 --> 04:15:04.889
HEALTH CARE IS THAT HOW WE

04:15:04.956 --> 04:15:07.125
ALWAYS SEEM TO UNDERVALUE

04:15:07.191 --> 04:15:09.394
COGNITIVE SERVICES. AND THAT

04:15:09.460 --> 04:15:10.561
THIS IS A CHALLENGE OF RUN INTO

04:15:10.628 --> 04:15:12.630
PRIMARY CARE RIGHT. PROCEDURES

04:15:12.697 --> 04:15:14.232
ARE OFTEN VERY WELL REIMBURSED

04:15:14.298 --> 04:15:16.668
BUT- COGNITIVE SERVICE AND TO

04:15:16.734 --> 04:15:17.935
FIND KIND OF IRONIC BECAUSE

04:15:18.002 --> 04:15:19.837
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I GO. GET

04:15:19.904 --> 04:15:25.576
LEGAL ADVICE. MY ATTORNEY- I

04:15:25.643 --> 04:15:27.345
SEEM TO GET BILL WHEN I ON THE-

04:15:27.412 --> 04:15:27.945
FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME I TALK

04:15:28.012 --> 04:15:29.847
TO ACCOUNTANT. THING YET

04:15:29.914 --> 04:15:31.582
DISPOSITION AND I GET YOU KNOW

04:15:31.649 --> 04:15:32.784
THE PEDIATRICIAN I GET PHONE

04:15:32.850 --> 04:15:34.686
CALLS FROM PATIENTS- FOR SOME

04:15:34.752 --> 04:15:36.521
REASON THAT'S WOULD BE FREE. IS

04:15:36.587 --> 04:15:39.624
IT. THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING I'VE

04:15:39.691 --> 04:15:44.829
HAD NOT HAD VALUE. WHY IS IT.

04:15:44.896 --> 04:15:47.265
WHY DON'T WE VALUE THAT

04:15:47.331 --> 04:15:48.633
KNOWLEDGE THAT PRIMARY CARE

04:15:48.700 --> 04:15:50.168
KNOWLEDGE THE SAME WAY AND SO

04:15:50.234 --> 04:15:52.437
WE WONDER WHY DOCTORS GO INTO

04:15:52.503 --> 04:15:53.571
SPECIALTIES AND NOT INTO

04:15:53.638 --> 04:15:59.010
PRIMARY CARE- AND THAT IS SO- I

04:15:59.077 --> 04:16:00.344
THINK WE SENT WERE SENDING OUT

04:16:00.411 --> 04:16:01.479
WELL MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

04:16:01.546 --> 04:16:03.014
ACCESS ISSUE I MEAN IT'S NOT

04:16:03.081 --> 04:16:04.115
ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE

04:16:04.182 --> 04:16:05.583
PROVIDERS IT'S MORE ABOUT THE

04:16:05.650 --> 04:16:07.752
PATIENTS BUT BUT I THINK WE

04:16:07.819 --> 04:16:08.352
ALSO THINK WE CAN MESSAGE WE

04:16:08.419 --> 04:16:10.488
SENT TO YOU KNOW AND WE TALK

04:16:10.555 --> 04:16:11.823
ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO REDUCE

04:16:11.889 --> 04:16:12.990
HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL GET MORE

04:16:13.057 --> 04:16:14.892
PRIMARY CARE SUPPORT AND FOR

04:16:14.959 --> 04:16:17.095
GOD SAKES THAN. WHAT YOU VALUE

04:16:17.161 --> 04:16:19.030
PRIMARY CARE THEN TELL US WHAT

04:16:19.097 --> 04:16:20.965
WE'RE WORSE TAYLOR SAID FOR THE

04:16:21.032 --> 04:16:22.767
THINGS WE DO RIGHT AND NOT WHAT

04:16:22.834 --> 04:16:23.735
WE WORTH A TASTE FOR THE THINGS

04:16:23.801 --> 04:16:25.169
WE DID WITH THAT EXPERTISE IS

04:16:25.236 --> 04:16:28.339
IMPORTANT AND- SO YOU KNOW IT'S

04:16:28.406 --> 04:16:33.077
NOT 65% SHOULD BE 100% AT THE

04:16:33.144 --> 04:16:34.479
THEN OF COURSE IF WE THINK

04:16:34.545 --> 04:16:35.246
ABOUT CLINICAL JUDGMENT SO

04:16:35.313 --> 04:16:36.247
NEEDS TO BE FACE TO FACE IN

04:16:36.314 --> 04:16:37.548
FRONT US TO DO AN EXAM THEN

04:16:37.615 --> 04:16:39.817
THAT SHOULD BE OUR CALL. RIGHT

04:16:39.884 --> 04:16:40.885
FOR US TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE

04:16:40.952 --> 04:16:42.186
IF YOU THINK WE'RE TRYING TO

04:16:42.253 --> 04:16:43.421
TEACH YOU IN THAT WAY THEN WE

04:16:43.488 --> 04:16:44.589
HAVE ANOTHER CONVERSATION WE

04:16:44.655 --> 04:16:46.824
NEED TO HAVE. OTHERWISE IT

04:16:46.891 --> 04:16:47.658
SHOULD BE UP TO OUR JUDGMENT AS

04:16:47.725 --> 04:16:50.528
TO. WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

04:16:50.595 --> 04:16:52.230
DO TO PROVIDE THE QUALITY OF

04:16:52.296 --> 04:16:55.666
CARE TO THE PATIENTS. AND- AND

04:16:55.733 --> 04:16:56.434
CERTAINLY SHOULD BE HELD

04:16:56.501 --> 04:16:58.136
ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT BUT WE

04:16:58.202 --> 04:16:59.637
SHOULD BE ASSUMING UP IN THE

04:16:59.704 --> 04:17:01.205
FRONT BY SAYING ALL WE ONLY GET

04:17:01.272 --> 04:17:02.740
65% THAT WE'RE PROVIDING LOWER

04:17:02.807 --> 04:17:05.109
QUALITY CARE JUST BECAUSE

SOMEONE'S OVER THE PHONE. AND

04:17:07.044 --> 04:17:08.713

AWAY ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

04:17:21.592 --> 04:17:23.127
