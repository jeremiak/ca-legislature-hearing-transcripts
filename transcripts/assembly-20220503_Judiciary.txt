I HAVE THAT RIGHT AND AS YOU DO THAT. I WILL NOTE THAT MR BLOOM AND HIS CAREER WILL BE JOINING US TODAY AS TEMPORARY MEMBERS THANK YOU WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE HERE. AND ON THE AGENDA I WERE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY FIVE GALLAGHER HAS BEEN PULLED FROM TODAY'S AGENDA ALL RIGHT THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS. THE BILL IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT I'M GLAD WE'RE ABLE TO. WORK OUT THESE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION. THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO AND HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AND NEGOTIATE. WITH THE OPPOSITION A TENANCY IN COMMON OR A TECH FOR SHORT IS A TYPE OF SHARED OWNERSHIP THAT ALLOWS TWO OR MORE PEOPLE TO SHARE OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OF A SINGLE PROPERTY. THE TENANTS ARE ABLE TO BUY AN INTEREST HAVE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO OCCUPY THEIR UNIT AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNING. PROPERTY A SIMILAR UC IN MANY RESPECTS TO A CONDOMINIUM. A TECHS ARE TYPICALLY DONE BY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO RESIDE ON THE SAME PROPERTY AND IT TOOK OF THE SUBSTRUCTURE PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUILDING EQUITY. UNFORTUNATELY SOME REAL ESTATE SPECULATORS HAVE USED THE TENANTS IN COMMON STRUCTURE TO CIRCUMVENT REGULATIONS THAT ARE TYPICAL OF CONDO CONVERSIONS. AND TO GET OUR IMPORTANT TEXTS ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT IN THE SAME WAY COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS. CONDOMINIUMS AND COMMUNITY APARTMENTS ARE. SELLERS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE STATUS OF THE PROPERTY TO INTERESTED BUYERS OR THE LAWS PROTECTING. EXISTING TENANTS NOR OUR SELLERS REQUIRED TO GIVE EXISTING LONG TERM TENANTS THE FIRST RIGHT TO BUY INTO THE PROPERTY. AS SUCH SPECULATORS HAVE BEEN PURCHASING MULTI FAMILY HOUSING CONVERTING THE PROPERTIES INTO TEXTS. EVICTING EXISTING TENANTS AND MISLEADING CONSUMERS INTERESTED IN BUYING OWNERSHIP. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX WILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ESTABLISH PARAMETERS FOR THE CONVERSION OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND TO TEX. THE BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT TEXT OR LIMIT THE AREA FOR TENANTS OCCUPY IT SIMPLY PROVIDES LOCAL AGENCIES THE ABILITY TO REGULATE THE DESIGN SUCH AS DRAINAGE FIRE ROADS TRAFFIC ACCESS. AS WELL AS UTILITY IMPROVEMENTS AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX WILL ALLOW LOCAL AGENCIES TO DO THEIR PART IN FACILITATING ORDERLY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATE PLANNING AND ASSURE PROPERTY A PROPER IMPROVEMENTS. TO THE PROPERTY ARE MADE WITH ME TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS JONATHAN HOLIDAY THE RENT STABILIZATION DIVISION MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM YOU MENTION THE MOMENTS BUT YOUR TAKING THOSE AUTHORS IN THEM YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU CHAIR A GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING THERE IS A COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JONATHAN HOLLAND AND I'M THE RENT STABILIZATION DIVISION MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO THREE EIGHT SIX. IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT CITIES ARE TASKED AND SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES ORDERLY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATION OF LOCAL PLANNING AND INSURE THAT WHEN THERE IS A LAND USE CONVERSION. PROPER IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE. FOR THE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT CODIFIES THIS RESPONSIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS CONDOMINIUMS. ALTHOUGH TENANTS IN COMMON PROJECTS WHICH ARE OFFERED FOR SALE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC FOR MOST OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS. THEY DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE SUBDIVISION MAP ACT OR DAVID STERLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT. THEREFORE T. I. C. DEVELOPMENTS ARE BEING USED BY DEVELOPERS TO AVOID LOCAL LAND USE REGULATION THAT OTHER SIMILARLY SITUATED DEVELOPERS MUST HERE TO. WEST HOW. SEVERAL MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES HAVE BEEN TAKEN OFF THE RENTAL MARKET BY DEVELOPERS. AND MARKETED AND SOLD AS A TENANTS IN COMMON. THESE ARE NOT DUPLEXES OR TRIPLEXES ON BY A GROUP OF CLOSE ACQUAINTANCES OR FAMILY MEMBERS. WHETHER WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN WEST HOLLYWOOD IS BUILDINGS OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS BEING OFFERED BY DEVELOPERS. FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC WITH EACH PURCHASE ARE BEING INEFFECTIVE OWNER OF AN INDIVIDUAL UNIT. AND PRESUMABLY BEARING SOME DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMMON AREAS OF THE PROPERTY. THIS IS A DE FACTO CONDOMINIUM CONVERSION. BUT UNLIKE IN A FORMAL CONDOMINIUM CNVERSION TENANTS ARE EVICTED WITHOUT ANY RIGHT OF pASSURANCE OF FULL DISCLOSURES ARE MADE. TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS ABOUT THE RISKS AND LIMITATIONS OF OWNING AND OCCUPYING PROPERTY. THE CONTINUES TO BE DESIGNATED AS A MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTY. IN ADDITION TO FARMING THE AUTHORITY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO ENGAGE IN LAND USE REGULATION. AB TWO THREE EIGHT SIX WOULD ENSURE THE PROPER GOVERNANCE OF COMMON AREAS OCCURS IN THAT PERSPECTIVE T. ICY UNIT PURCHASERS. ARE MADE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF RENTING UNIT HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE RENTAL MARKET. WITHOUT THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ONE PURCHASER COKIE CUT CHAOS FOR OTHER INNOCENT PARTIES HAVE BOUGHTINTO THE T. ICY. AS DEVELOPERS APPLY THIS MODEL LARGER PROPERTIES WITH MORE RESIDENTIAL UNITS THAT'S OCCURRING IN WEST HOLLYWOOD. THE DANGER FOR CHAOTIC SITUATIONS GROWS EXPONENTIALLY. AB TWO THREE EIGHT SIX WOULD GIVE CITIES THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO AVOID SUCH SITUATIONS. THE CITY WAS T&lt;c.cyan&gt; BELIEVE THAT AB TWO&lt;/c&gt; THREE SIX PROVIDES A COMMONSENSE APPROACH CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LOCAL AUTHORITY REGARDING CONVERSIONS OF RENTAL PROPERTIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. SIR ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY SIX.

FOR EVERY BOXING MATCH INCLUDE WILL CHAMPION FIGHTS IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE ATHLETES FORTUNATELY THE DISCRETIONARY NATURE OF THESE DECISIONS COULD EXPOSE THE EXACT OFFICER TO SOME MEDICATION UNDER EXISTING LAW PUBLIC EMPLOYEES NOT LIABLE FOR AN INJURY RESULTING FROM A DISCRETIONARY- THE DECISION. HOWEVER THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE ATHLETIC COMMISSION SO THIS LEGISLATION WILL SIMPLY CLARIFY THAT THE OBJECTIVE OFFER THAT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE ATHLETIC COMMISSION IS NOT LIABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY DECISIONS.

THIS BILL SIMPLY CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW THE EXISTING EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS THE HIGHEST RANKING STATE EMPLOYEE OF THE COMMISSION AND HAS RESPONSIBILITY OF APPROVING BALLOTS FOR BOXING KICKBOXING MOUTAI A MIXED MARTIAL ARTS AS WELL AS A SIGNING ALL OFFICIALS TO THOSE SPORTS THE BILL WILL FURTHER CLARIFY THAT THIS RESPONSIBILITY AND DUTY IS DISCRETIONARY. THE BILL WILL SAVE THE COMMISSION HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PROCESS AND POTENTIAL. LITIGATION COSTS THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN FORCED TO DEFEND ISSUES STEMMING FROM THIS LACK OF CLARITY ON THE DISCRETIONARY IMMUNITY ACT MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE COST TO THE COMMISSION'S BUDGET TO PAY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOR DEFENSE FEES.

THANK YOU THAT BILL IS OUT RIGHT MISS WICKS ARE ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO. WELCOME. WITH. I SHOULD HAVE A- WITNESS WITH ME BOTH ON THE TELEPHONE I GUESS THEY'RE BOTH ON THE PHONE OKAY. THAT'LL WORK TOO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I THINK YOU ALL ARE HEARING THIS BILL HERE FOR ME- FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION OCCURS WHEN AN EMPLOYER TAKES A NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE WHO CARES FOR A FAMILY MEMBER. THIS INCLUDES MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT BREAST FEEDING PEOPLE AND EMPLOYEES WITH AGING PARENTS SIX PASSES OR PARTNERS. AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO PROHIBITS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST EMPLOYEES BASED ON THEIR FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES ENSURES WORKING FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS TO DEAL WITH UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES. SUCH AS CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS OR OTHER CARE FACILITIES. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THIS COMMITTEE WHEN I PRESENTED THIS BILL LAST YEAR. IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE VERY HELPFUL COMMENT THAT I RECEIVED DURING LAST YEAR HEARING- WE I HAVE REVISED THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PORTION OF MY BILL SO THAT THE PROCESS IS MUCH MORE CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. THIS BILL INCLUDES A VARIETY OF SIMPLE OPTIONS THAT AN EMPLOYER MAY USED TO ADDRESS THE CAREGIVING NEEDS. OF WORKING MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF YOUNG CHILDREN PREGNANT PEOPLE LOW WAGE EARNERS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION. OPTIONS LIKE SHIFTING IT WORKERS HOURS EXCUSING THEM FROM MANDATORY OVERTIME ALLOWING THEM TO WORK REMOTELY OR SWAPPING SHIFTS WITH ANOTHER EMPLOYEE. STILL THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE SUCH AN ACCOMMODATION SO LONG AS IT DOES NOT IMPOSE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP. THIS BILL. IT SORRY THIS IS A VERY LIMITED NARROW ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYERS BUT IT WILL PROVIDE AN ENORMOUS RELIEF FOR WORKERS WHO MAY FACE. THESE UNFORESEEN CARE EMERGENCIES. A STUDY IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL SOCIOLOGY FOUND THAT 79% OF MOTHERS EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY DISCRIMINATION. THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS SAID. THIS BILL SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIA LAWYERS EMPLOYMENT ASSOCIATION EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES A LEGAL AID AT WORK. AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. WITH ME TO TESTIFY OVER THE PHONE IS DEREK. AND SIDE NOTE DEREK FROM GOING TO PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME CORRECTLY TO SINGER. WHO IS A RETIRED FIREFIGHTER AND LIZ MORRIS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF HASTINGS CENTER FOR WORK LIFE LAW AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE DEREK TO SINGER AND LIZ MORRIS ARE YOU. EITHER OF YOU WITH US. THEIR CAT URINE HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GO AHEAD THAT THE PIE YES YES PLEASE DO. GOOD MORNING- MY NAME'S DEREK TICE SINGER I'M A RETIRED- FIRE CHIEF FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY- EARLY ON IN MY CAREER I WAS WORKING FOR THE BAKERSFIELD CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT. AND I DID I EXPERIENCE DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF MY FAMILY CARE GIVING RESPONSIBILITIES- AFTER WORKING FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN YEARS- I BECAME A SINGLE PARENT A SOLE CAREGIVER FOR. FIVE THREE YOUNG SONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY I ASSUME THAT- MUCH GREATER CHILD CARE RESPONSIBILITIES- ARE DEPARTMENT- HAD A SHIP TRADING POLICY THAT ALLOWED EMPLOYEES TO SWAP SHIPS. WHEN WE NEED IT OR THE MODIFIER SCHEDULES WHICH I OBVIOUSLY TOOK ADVANTAGE JOB- SHIP TRADING WAS READ USED BY THE EMPLOYEES AND APPROVED BY SUPERVISORS FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS. IN ORDER TO MEET MY OBLIGATIONS TO BOTH MY EMPLOYER INTO MY FAMILY I TRADED SHIFTS WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES SO I COULD PICK UP MY KIDS FROM SCHOOL AND TAKE HER TAKE THEM HOME TAKE CARE OF A MAKE DINNER MAKE SURE THEY GOT THEIR HOMEWORK DONE STUFF LIKE THAT THEN I'D GO BACK TO WORK- EVEN THOUGH I DID THAT I CONTINUE TO PERFORM MY DUTIES TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS. AND WAS COMMITTED TO MY JOB WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY- BY FIRE CHIEF AT THE TIME. I'M CONSTANTLY AND REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED ME ABOUT MY CHILD CARE OBLIGATIONS. IN THE END- I WAS PASSED OVER FOR A PROMOTION TO CAPTAIN EVEN THOUGH I WAS RANKED NUMBER ONE ON THE ELIGIBILITY LIST AND WAS WELL MORE QUALIFIED THAN THE THAN THE CANDIDATES BEHIND ME. IN MY EVALUATION- ONE OF MY BY WHITE THE FIRE CHIEF EVEN. PUT IN WRITING. AND SAID THAT I NEEDED TO FIND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF CHILD CARE. ANY CRITICIZED MY USE OF THE SHIP TRADING POLICY THANK CALL BY REASONS FOR SHIP TRADING GARBAGE. HE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER THAT MY JOB WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BY RESPONSIBILITY- AS A FATHER AND- TAKING CARE OF MY KIDS. YOU KNOW I KNEW THAT WAS WRONG AND SO MY ONLY- I GUESS AFTER FILING- SEVERAL- UP HERE YOU KNOW COMPLAINTS AND STUFF LIKE THAT BY I WAS LEFT WITH NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO FILE A LAWSUIT. BECAUSE PARENTS ARE PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION IN CALIFORNIA. I BOUGHT A CLAIM FORM OF MARITAL STATUS DISCRIMINATION SINCE I WAS A SINGLE PARENT. AT THE TRIAL THE JURY FOUND IN MY FAVOR. AND IN FACT- IT WAS SO OVERWHELMED I MEAN THEY CAME BACK AND LEFT WITH AN HOUR AND A HALF AND AWARD ME- AND- NOT ONLY- MY PROMOTION BUT THEY ALSO AWARDED ME SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS I HAD NATURAL DYE. IN THIS SITUATION IN FACT THE JURY FOREMAN HAD TOLD- TOLD A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE TIME THAT IT BUT SHE HAD HAD HER WAY THEY WERE GIVEN THE A MILLION DOLLARS IT WAS THAT CLEAR CUT- IT SEEMED LIKE THEY HAD A STATE DEMEAN OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD A CLEAR SENSE OF MY EMPLOYER'S ACTIONS. AND WHAT WAS WRONG AND AFFECT THEM. THAT AND THAT'S WHY IT SUCKS VERY SHORT TIME TO COME TO MY CONCLUSION- THERE'S NO- UNFORTUNATELY THE CITY APPEALED- MY BURKE. AND THE COURT APPEAL STATED THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THIS RECORD CONTAINS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE FROM WHICH THE JURY COULD CONFIRM OR IMPORT PRICING OR WAS PASSED OVER BECAUSE OF HIS CHAIR- CHILD CARE RESPONSIBILITIES. HOWEVER THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS PASSED OVER BECAUSE HE WAS SINGLE AND THE AT THE IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS NO LAW AT THAT TIME TO PROTECT. BUT LOST SOMETHING NOT PUT ME FROM THE- THAT I DID EXPERIENCE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN OUR IN OUR BEEN PART OF THIS PROCESS BUT SINCE WE STARTED THIS BILL YEARS AGO AND I'D LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS PAST- MY GRADES ARE THERE NOW BROWN AND I'M PROUD. TO SAY THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET THEM ALL THROUGH COLLEGE AND ALL THREE OF THEM THERE ARE NOW A PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHILE I'M STILL DEEPLY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEIR JOB AND OUR FAMILY- AND THAT'S WHY- THE BILL AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NEXT WITNESS LIZ MORRIS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU I'M WITH MORRIS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW. WE THOUGHT DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO CARING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THE ELDERLY AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DISABILITIES. FACE HEART WRENCHING CHOICES. BETWEEN PROVIDING ADEQUATE CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND KEEPING THE PAYING JOB THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. BUT THESE CHOICES ARE NOT NEW. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILY CAREGIVERS EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE AND TAKE WE TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS IT NOW. BIAS AGAINST MOTHERS OF THE CHALK STRONGEST FORM OF GENDER BIAS AGAINST WOMEN LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GENDER PAY GAP. WOMEN OF COLOR SINGLE MOTHERS IMMIGRANTS AND WORKERS IN LOW PAYING JOBS. THE HARSH IMPACT. WHEN MOTHERS ARE FIRED THEIR CHILDREN SUFFER WITH STUDENT SECURITY HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER PLAGUE THE POVERTY. AS YOU HEARD FROM A SINGLE PARENT WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE ME MEN ALSO FACE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CARE GIVING WHEN THEY'RE PUNISHED FOR VIOLATING OUTDATED GENDER NORMS. BADLY CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND NATIONALLY IN ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FAMILY CAREGIVERS. OVER 30% OF THE AMERICAN ORK FORCE IS ALREADY PROTECTED BY A STATE OR LOCAL LAWS THAT PROHIBIT THE FORMAT DISCRIMINATION. VARIANTS OF THE OTHERS THAT SHOWS US THAT PROHIBITING CAREGIVER DISCRIMINATION DOES NOT INCREASE LITIGATION RIGHT. ACTIVE THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES FACING CAREGIVER DISCRIMINATION ALREADY HAVE SOME LEGAL RIGHT BASED ON THE PATCHWORK OF OTHER LAWS RELATED TO MARITAL STATUS DISABILITY GENDER CHILDBIRTH AND FAMILY LEAVE. BUT THE PROTECTION FROM FAMILY CARE GIVING DISCRIMINATION IT'S NOT CLEAR OR EXPLICIT AND IN SOME CASES LIKE WITH THE FIRST WITNESS THEIR GIVERS CAN FALL THROUGH THE GAPS. BY EXPLICITLY LABELLING FAMILY CAREGIVERS AS A CLEARLY PROTECTED CLASS AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO WOULD ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO TREAT THEM BASED ON THEIR JOB PERFORMANCE. INSTEAD OF BIAS WHICH HAS THE POWER TO BOTH SAVE JOBS AND AVOID LOTS. IN FACT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT FROM THE CENTER FOR WORKLIFE LAW FOUND THE LIKELIHOOD AN EMPLOYER WILL BE ISSUED UNDER AN EXPLICIT CAREGIVER DISCRIMINATION LAW. IS ZERO POINT 0001% NEW RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINT FILED WITH ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN OTHER STATES ACTUALLY WENT DOWN IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING ENACTMENT. PROPELLING FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES IS NOT A PRIVATE FROLIC IF THE HARD AND NECESSARY WORK OF CARING FOR THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF WORKERS THAT WILL EEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO. RIGHT SING NINE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO. WE WILL NOT BE TAKING FURTHER TESTIMONY BUT JUST NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF- AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO. PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY A PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE FELL BY ZERO FOR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO WE WILL BEGIN WITH WINE- THIRTY ONE YOU ARE OPEN.

WE FRIEDMAN WITH THE JEWISH CENTER FOR JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WHY DID YOU ARE OPEN. HI UNDER DACA PRESIDENT I'M A VOLUNTEER WITH A RP CALIFORNIA AND WE URGE YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT TWENTY ONE EIGHTY TWO. NINE THIRTY FIVE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MEDICARE MEMBERS MARIE GO YES THEY ARE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA INCLEMENT ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR THE NO THE- QUEUED UP. YOUR PRINTER WE NOW MOVE TO OFFER I DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION LISTED BUT IS THERE ANYONE IN HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. A GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACTUALLY HALF IT ACTUALLY OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. AND WHAT WE DO STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE DEFICIT- THE BILL'S BROAD DEFINITION OF FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES I DO WANT TO FOCUS MY TESTIMONY TODAY ON THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS- THE AMENDMENTS FUNCTIONALLY DO VERY LITTLE OTHER THAN TAKING OUT THE SEPARATE INTERACTIVE PROCESS REQUIREMENTS. THE BILL STILL REQUIRES A BUSINESS TO ACCOMMODATE A WORKER ANYTIME THEY HAVE AN UNFORESEEN FAMILY RESPONSIBILITY RISE AND ALL THE BILL SAYS IT'S ONLY FOR UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN ACTUALITY THE EMPLOYER REALLY HAS NO MEANS OF CHALLENGING THAT. AND IF THEY TRIED THEY FACE WHAT IS AN AVERAGE COST OF A ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LAWSUIT UNDER FEE HAWK IN A STATE WHERE YOU HAVE A 56% CHANCE OF BEING SUED UNDER THAT LAW. WHICH IS MORE THAN 40% MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. FURTHER THE PROPONENTS SAY YOU KNOW THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE IF IT'S GOING TO CAUSE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP HOWEVER UNDER HARDSHIP ISN'T TOWARDS THE HIGH BAR TO SATISFY. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IT IS THE CAUSE OF A LOT OF LITIGATION AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS DETERMINED ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AFTER GOING THROUGH A SERIES OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS SO THERE'S REALLY NO WAY FOR BUSINESS TO KNOW. IF THEY CLAIM THAT THEY REALLY DO A NEW HARDSHIP WHETHER THAT WOULD HOLD UP IN COURT OR WHAT HAVE YOU. THIS IS WHY OTHER STATUTES ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE SUCH AS LABOR CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY POINT EIGHT- WHICH ACTUALLY PROVIDES LEAVE FOR UNFORESEEN CHILD CARE ISSUES THE FAMILY RIGHT SECTOR PAID SICK LEAVE- HAVE GUARD RAILS ON THE MAX AMOUNT OF TIME. THAT CAN BE USE OF AN EMPLOYER WANTS TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO WORK FOR HOME. THEY'RE HAPPILY YOU KNOW GOING TO EXCUSE EMPLOYEE FROM ATTENDANCE POLICY WHAT HAVE YOU THEY CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THAT HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME GUARDRAILS TO PROTECT THEM AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CAN BE YOU STE. I'M I DO ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE CONCERN OF THE NEW AMENDMENTS- PROPOSED SECTION ONE TWO NINE FOUR EIGHT POINT FIVE C. I. WHICH IS ACTUALLY MORE TROUBLESOME THAN THE PRIOR REASONABLE COMMON. ACCOMMODATION REQUIREMENTS OF THAT PROVISION SAYS THAT THE EMPLOYER CHOIR EMPLOYEE TO TAKE TIME OFF WORK IF THERE'S ANOTHER ACCOMMODATION THAT WOULD BE. EFFECTIVE SO NORMALLY I'M DURING IN CASE LINE. HA THE- ACTUALLY HOW FULL DISK. OVER THE COMEDY. AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE THE WORKERS PREFERRED REQUESTED ACCOMMODATION. SO THE SECTION ACTUALLY TAKES THAT DISCRETION AWAY. YOU CONSIDER A SMALL RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES SAYS HEY I'D LIKE TO COME IN LATE BUT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN I'LL BE IN. IT MAY BE MORE FEASIBLE FOR THAT DAY'S OPERATIONS TO CALL SOMEONE ELSE INSTEAD INTEREST GIVE THAT EMPLOYEE TIME OFF WORK. HOWEVER THIS BILL DOES NOT ALLOW THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THAT CALL- WE BELIEVE THE FOR THE BILL FURTHER UNDERMINES ABSENCE INTERCEDE. TARDINESS POLICIES LONG SIMPLY CLAIMS UNFORESEEN CHILD CARE ISSUE THAT POLICIES ENFORCEABLE- WE DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH AUTHOR LAST YEAR AND WE HAD A- MEETING ASSIST IT HAD TO BE RESCHEDULED- THIS YEAR SO I. YOU KNOW LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY DISCUSSING MORE WITH HER AWAY TO POTENTIALLY ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL- BUT WITHOUT OPPOSING THIS.

AND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF TRAUMA ALL OF WHICH LEAD TO DELAY IN THE SURVIVORS ABILITY TO FACE THEIR ASSAILANTS AND SEEK JUSTICE. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN SIX TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NATURAL DELAY THAT OCCURS OFTEN DRAMATIC OFTEN AFTER. A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE IN SOME CIVIL CLAIMS BASED UPON ACTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HARASSMENT BY ALLOWING VICTIMS. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ADDITIONAL TIME TO GO TO COURT WHEN THEIR CLAIM WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN BARRED SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRED. OR TIME HAS RUN OUT. THIS INCLUDES CLAIMS AGAINST THE DEFENDANTS A DEFENDANT ENTITY WHO HAS ENGAGED IN A COVER UP OF A PRIOR INCIDENT OF SEXUAL ABUSE OR MISCONDUCT.

SERRA LEWIS SURVIVOR AND NAOMI A BODY PRESIDENT OF THE AND FOUNDER OF THE FEMALE COMPOSERS SAFETY LEAGUE. THANK YOU AND THERE ARE MOMENTS LISTED IN THE- ANALYSIS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE OFF YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. SHE ON THE LINE SHE SAID MORNING. OKAY SO MY NAME IS SIR LEWIS GO AHEAD THEN. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS SERRA WRITTEN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN. TWO MONTHS AFTER I WAS HIRED BY A PROMINENT PUBLISHING COMPANY IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AS THE ASSISTANT TO VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FILM AND TV DEPARTMENT A NEW SENIOR EXECUTIVE WAS HIRED. WITHIN SIX MONTHS THE NEW SENIOR EXECUTIVES BEGAN GROOMING ME FOR SEX. I WOULD TWENTY THREE HE WAS IN HIS LATE FORTIES. WHEN WE TRAVEL TOGETHER TO VANCOUVER HE TOLD ME HE WS IN LOVE WITH ME I COULD NOT CONTROL HIS FEELINGS FOR ME. I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T FEEL THE SAME. ON OUR RETURN FLIGHT HOME. THE UPGRADE MY TICKET TO FIRST CLASS. TRAVEL BY THE SAME TOWN CAR TO OUR RESPECTIVE HOMES. ALL THE WHILE HOLDING MY HAND. IN THE WINTER TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WE TRAVEL TO CHICAGO WHERE HE INSISTED THAT WE STAY IN HOTEL ROOMS ACROSS FROM ONE ANOTHER. LATER THAT NIGHT HE ENTERED MY ROOM GOT ON TOP OF ME DESPITE MY PROTESTS. INTERESTED BOTH AND ATTEMPTED PENETRATION. AT THE SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE IN AUSTIN HE PRESSURED ME TO SPEND A LONG TIME WITH THEM. WHEN I WOULD AVOID HIM HE WOULD EXPRESS ANGER. AFTER THAT TRIP. I ATTENDED A HANDFUL CLIENT BINDING BUT HAD ABSOLUTELY ZERO SUPPORT ON HAND OR MY COMPANY. I THOUGHT I HAD NO CHOICE OTHER THAN TO LEAVE MY JOB IN MAY TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. FOR ANOTHER MUCH SMALLER PUBLISHING COMPANY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ALL OF MY EARLIER SUCCESS AND STOPPED UNTIL A FEMALE COLLEAGUE TOLD ME THAT OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY HAD GRANTED ME AS AN HIGHER LEVEL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION PLACE. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS NOMI ABADI I AM A MUSIC COMPOSER AND I AM A SEXUAL ABUSE SURVIVOR IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN. BECAUSE OF WHAT I WENT THROUGH AND WHAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY INDUSTRY I FOUNDED THE FEMALE COMPOSERS SAFETY LEAK. THE FEMALE COMPOSER SAFETY LEAGUE IS A NONPROFIT THAT UNITES WOMEN AND ALLIES WITH A MISSION TO ENSURE THE SAFETY ADVANCEMENT AND EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN AND OTHER MINORITIES IN THE MUSIC COMPOSING INDUSTRY. WE PROVIDE COMMUNITY MENTORSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP BREAK BREAK THE INDUSTRY STIGMAS SURROUNDING TRAUMA AND SHAME. AS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WOMEN MAKE UP ROUGHLY 7% OF THE FILM COMPOSING INDUSTRY AND ARE SEVERELY UNDER REPRESENTED AND UNDER PROTECTED IN THE FIELD OF MUSIC COMPOSING. ALREADY IN THE MINORITY VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE RARELY FILE CLAIMS WITHIN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DUE TO FEARS OF RETALIATION AND OTHER INTIMIDATION. FOR OTHERS IT TAKES YEARS FOR THEM TO COME TO TERMS WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IN MUSIC INCLUDING SEXUAL ASSAULT IS SYSTEMIC AND HAS THIS HISTORICALLY BEEN SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. THE SEXUAL ABUSE AND COVER UP ACCOUNTABILITY ACT ADDRESSES THE FACT THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE SCIENCE OF TRAUMA AND ITS NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS. BY ALLOWING SURVIVORS THE TIME NEEDED TO COME FORWARD PARTICULARLY WHEN THERE HAS BEEN HELP MOVE THE STATE ONE MORE STEP TOWARD THE CHANGE THAT VICTIMS DESERVE. THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS A JEFFREY JEFFREY MONROE FROM THE VICTIM POLICY INSTITUTE IS THAT ON THE TELEPHONE AVAILABLE FOR TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. SAY NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN WE WILL NOT TAKE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY BUT WE WILL TAKE NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IF YOU ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN- PLEASE TAKE THIS AFTERNOON PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ONE FELL BY ZERO. MISTER CHAIRMAN WHETHER PARTICIPANTS ARE QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE JAMIE HUFF AND KERRY SILVERMAN. BOTH IN THE HEARING ROOM. IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING WARNING OKAY BUSINESS ON MY CLOSE ENOUGH OKAY MEMBERS JAMIE UP ON BEHALF OF C. JOCK- RESPECTFULLY ADDRESSING THE COMMITTEE TODAY WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLICY IN AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT I HAVE NOTHING BUT EMPATHY AND RESPECT FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL ARE FOCUSED ON THE INABILITY TO DEFEND AGAINST REVIVER CASES WHERE EVIDENCE HAS DISAPPEARED THE BILL'S BROAD DRAFTING ON ITS EXCLUSION OF PUBLIC ENTITIES FROM THE PROVISIONS IN TERMS OF SCOPE THE BILL WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO LAWSUITS AGAINST BUSINESSES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ALLEGING NOT ONLY SEXUAL ASSAULT. BUT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT COMMUNICATION OR ACTIVITY NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN OTHER WORDS A FORMER RESTAURANT SERVER WHO RETIRED TWENTY YEARS AGO COULD SUE ALLEGING INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS WERE MADE BY A PATRON IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ON THE RESTAURANT WILL HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY OR DISPROVE SUCH ALLEGATIONS. ALL CO WORKERS WHO HAVE WITNESSED THE INCIDENT HAVE RETIRED OR PASSED ON A NO RECORDS OF THE INCIDENT. IF THERE WERE ANY CAPS IN THE FIRST PLACE WILL REMAIN. MY COLLEAGUE FROM AFTER WILL SPEAK FURTHER ON WHY IT IS A CONCERN AND WHY STATURE LIMITATIONS ARE SO FUNDAMENTAL. TO LEGAL CLAIMS. THE BILL'S DEFINITION OF COVER UP EVEN AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED IS PROBLEMATIC. BECAUSE IT IS SO BROAD IT COULD INCLUDE LEGITIMATE CONTACT. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THIS TERM USED IN PRIOR STATURE LIMITATIONS LAW HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY NINETEEN. CREATE CONFUSION IN OUR COURTS. ANOTHER PUZZLING ASPECT OF THE BILL IS THAT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO APPLY TO VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WHO VISITED OR WORKED FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY. SUCH AS THE LEGISLATURE OR STATE UNIVERSITIES THEY ARE COMPLETELY LEFT THE BILL AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS APPROPRIATELY POINTS OUT. IT'S UNCLEAR WHY WERE TREATING ONE SET OF SURVIVORS DIFFERENTLY FROM ANOTHER BASED ON WHERE THE ASSAULT TOOK PLACE AND BY WHOM. CALIFORNIA JUST EXTENDED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR SUCH CLAIMS AS RECENTLY AS THREE YEARS AGO. AND WE HAVE YET TO HEAR ANOTHER COMPELLING REASON WHY CALIFORNIA NEEDS ANOTHER REVIVER BILL AT THIS TIME. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS CARRIE SELF BERMAN AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF. OF THE AMERICAN TORT REFORM ASSOCIATION TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS WITH AB TWO TRIPLE SEVEN. ADDRESS CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE WHAT WE SAID WE WAS IN A DISTURBING TREND. OF LEGISLATURES CONSIDERING BILLS AND IN SOME CASES ENACTING LAWS. THAT ELIMINATE OR TEMPORARILY SET ASIDE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS. AND REVIVE TIME BARRED CLAIMS. OF THIS TREND BEGAN AS YOU WELL KNOW WITH CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE CASES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND AS WE PREDICTED THEN. THESE VERY WELL INTENTIONED BILLS HAVE BEGUN A SLIPPERY SLOPE. STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE REALLY KEY TO THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE ENSURE THAT IT FUNCTIONS PROPERLY. THE ALLOW JUDGES AND JURIES. TO DECIDE LIABILITY. WHEN THE BEST EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE WHEN THE WITNESSES ARE AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY WHEN. BEFORE THE RECORDS ARE THROWN OUT. WHEN THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED AT THE TIME. WE HAVE FINITE STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN ANY CIVIL CASE WHETHER IT'S A LAWSUIT ON BEHALF OF A DRUNK DRIVER OF A PERSON KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER. A PERSON DEVELOPS CANCER DUE TO WHAT TOXIC SUBSTANCE WAS FIRED FROM A JOB FOR DISCRIMINATORY REASONS. AND THE LENGTH OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IT'S NOT. BASED ON THE INNOCENCE OF THE DEFENDANT'S ALLEGED CONDUCT. IT'S NOT BASED ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY EITHER IT'S BASED ON THE NEED FOR THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO DECIDE CASES BASED ON. ON EVIDENCE AND WHEN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ARE SET ASIDE IT MEANS THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A HEIGHTENED RISK. THAT CASES ARE GOING TO BE DECIDED BASED ON SYMPATHY FOR PLAINTIFF RATHER THAN WHETHER A DEFENDANT WAS TRULY RESPONSIBLE FOR PERSONS INJURY AND IT IT MEANS THAT. IT MAY MEAN THAT CASES ARE DECIDED BASED ON WHETHER A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION IS UNPOPULAR IS VIEWED AS HAVING. DEEP POCKETS RATHER THAN WHAT THE EVIDENCE MIGHT SHOW. AS MISS HOUGH EXPLAINED THIS BILL WHILE RESPONDING TO A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT- AT REVISED AN EXTREMELY BROAD RANGE OF CLAIMS THAT ARE VAGUELY DEFINED. IT'S THE MOST OPEN ENDED AND UNLIMITED REVIVER THAT I I'VE SEEN PROPOSED IN IN ANY STATE- IF THIS BILLS ENACTED IN ITS CURRENT FORM WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE CALLS WILL CONTINUE. APRICOT THE HAPS BECOME LOUDER TO REVIVE OTHER TYPES OF PLANES. WE SHOULDN'T DISCARD A KEY ELEMENT OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS THE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY OF DECISIONS ABOUT LIABILITY AND SAFEGUARDS TO PROCESS I THANK YOU FOR. THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED. WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU REYES ANYONE IN THE HEARING WHO LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. I WILL NOT TAKE ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY BUT NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION ASHLEY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS THAT LED BY SEJAK. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MARKET SEGMENT WITH AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION THE BILL THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN ALLIANCE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME WHEN FALL BY ZERO. AND MISTER CHAIR WE WERE LYING FIFTEEN YOU ARE OPEN. GOOD MORNING MR THIS IS RYAN ELAINE WITTY CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO OUR AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO ONE THIRTY NINE YOU ARE ALL BUT- HELLO THE SPELLING OF PETITIONS THAT THE PRIVILEGED OFF ON BEHALF THE PUBLIC RECKONING. AND POLLUTION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS IN FACT THE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WHICH CARE NO OTHER PARTICIPANTS ARE HAVE QUEUED UP. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISS CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR. OPPOSITION AND ONE FOR THE AUTHOR. SO LIMITED AUTHOR ON FIRST. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL. EXEMPTS CASES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SETTLED OR ADJUDICATED IN A COURT ROOM THAT RIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT BUT JEFF CAN YOU ANSWER THAT. YES THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY- TURNING TO THE STATURE LIMITATIONS ISSUE THESE THAT IN FOR FREE ANY OPPOSITION WITNESSES TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE BILL DEFINES SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR CHANGES SUCH INDICATIONS WITH REFERENCE TO THE PENAL CODE SECTIONS THAT REFER TO LEWD ACTS ON MINORS FORCIBLE RAPE. SODOMY ANSWERS EITHER- AND I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATURE ALREADY CHANGE THE CRIMINAL STATUTES ON PATIENTS FOR MOST MAYBE NOT ALL BUT MOST OF THOSE CRIMINAL SECTIONS THAT FORM THE BASIS OF THE DEFINITION FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT FOR THIS BILL TO ATTEND A TEN YEAR SESSION LIMITATIONS SO IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILLS ATTEMPTING TO DO CORRECTLY IT WOULD BE ALIGNING THE CIVIL STATUTE INDICATIONS WITH THE EXISTING CRIMINAL STATUTE LIMITATIONS AM I WRONG ABOUT THAT- IS THAT CORRECT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL AND THE BILL AND I BELIEVE IT'S GONE THROUGH SEVERAL. FORMS DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS AND SOME AMENDMENTS THERE THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROPOSER OR WILL BE PROPOSED HERE- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT REVIVED. ITS BILLS A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING THERE'S A GRASS YOU'RE TALKING MICROPHONE BETTER TROUBLE HEARING. MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S TO. ACTUAL REVIVER THIS THE FOR REVISED. IS GOING TO BE A SURVIVOR OF CLAIMS BASED ON THE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN LAW THAT SAID A TEN YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIMS AND THAT PART OF THE BILL- CROSS REFERENCES THE FELONY CRIMINAL. SEXUAL ASSAULT. STATUTE ON AND ALLOWS FOR CLAIMS TO GO BACK. AFFECTED THE MAKING THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. LAW FOR CIVIL CLAIMS RETROACTIVE TEN YEARS GOING BACKWARD. THERE'S A SEPARATE PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT- IS THE COVER A PROVISION THE PROVISION FOR THIS THIS OTHER REVIVER AND THAT'S A BIT DIFFERENT IT DOES THAT PROVISION OF THE BILL DOESN'T REFERENCE. ANY OF THE CRIMINAL FELONY PROVISIONS AND IT HAS THIS MUCH BROADER- TACK ON OF OTHER INAPPROPRIATE COMMUNICATIONS CONTACT CENTER- THERE'S NO REFERENCE THERE TO THE BILL IT'S MUCH BROADER AND IT GOES BACK AND DEFINITELY NOT NOT TEN TEN YEARS FROM THE- ESSENTIAL QUESTION YEAH BUT I'VE GOT A COUPLE FOLLOW US. SO THE NATURE OF COVER UPS IS IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THEIR ON DISCOVERED RIGHT SO. IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE TO ME I EAT YOU KNOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE DEFINITION OF COVER UP SHOULD BE AND HOW BROAD THAT SHOULD BE AND HOPEFULLY WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON TRYING TO NARROW THAT SO IT'S APPROPRIATE BUT- YOU. I MEAN YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION I THINK SOCIETALLY WHERE SOMEBODY SUCCESSFUL IN COVERING UP A PATTERN OF SEXUAL ABUSE LIKE. THESE HORRIBLE CASES THAT CAME WITH THE OUT OF I THINK WAS PENNSYLVANIA WITH THE GYMNASTS IN THE U. S. C. CASE AND SO FORTH. AS ALWAYS ARE GOOD AT COVERING IT UP FOR FOUR YEARS THERE FOR SCOT FREE RIGHT SO THAT I MEAN THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT THEN ON THE ALIGNMENT WITH CRIMINAL. I GET I AM NOT THAT. I'M NOT TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY I HEAR YOUR GENERAL TALKING POINTS ABOUT STATURE LIMITATIONS I DO BELIEVE THAT'S IMPORTANT DUE PROCESS SAFEGUARDS. IMPORTANT HAVE IN THE SYSTEM BUT IF WE'VE ALREADY CHANGED IT FOR THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THAT'S- BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT PROOF STANDARD AND SOMEBODY COULD GO TO PRISON FOR LIFE FOR SOME OF THE TAX. THEN WHY IS IT SO BAD THAT WE'RE CHANGING IT TO A LINE FOR THE CIVIL YEAH OUR OKAY I. I MISS BABY I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR QUESTION I THINK IT'S A- GOOD POINT YOU'RE RAISING WE- WE LOOK AT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY- YEAH THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CRIMINAL CLAIMS AND CIVIL CLAIMS AND CRIMINAL CLAIMS HAVE BUILT IN TWO AND A NUMBER OF SAFEGUARDS THAT THAT WE DON'T HAVE IN THE CIVIL SYSTEM. MEAN ONE THAT YOU MENTIONED IS THAT THE PROOF BURDEN OF PROOF IS MUCH HIGHER THE PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. WORDS AND SEVERAL SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE WHICH IS A MORE LIKELY THAN NOT STANDARD WHEN YOU'RE- LOOKING AT CLAIMS GOING BACK DECADES- AND YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW. A PERSON WHO FEELS AND LIKELY WAS VICTIMIZED VERSUS MAYBE AN ORGANIZATION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THEIR RECORDS ARE EMPLOYEES AROUND ANYWHERE. YOU KNOW THAT'S GONNA BE A STANDARD THAT'S NOT ALL TOO DIFFICULT TO MEET WHEN A JURY HAS TO. FIGURE OUT. WHO YOU GONNA BELIEVE THE PERSON WHO WAS VICTIMIZED OF THE PERSONAL EVIDENCE THERE- SO THAT'S ONE DIFFERENCE OF COURSE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALSO HAS A GRAND JURY. PROSECUTION PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION THEY'RE NOT GONNA TYPICALLY BRING CLAIMS WHERE THERE ISN'T SOME. EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE AMOUNTED BEFOREHAND WHERE IS IN THE CIVIL SYSTEM. YOU KNOW ANY PLAINTIFFS LAWYER COULD FOLLOW A COMPLAINT AND THAT'LL YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN CASES LIKE THIS WILL PLACE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE DEFENDANT TO SETTLE THAT CASE. ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE EVIDENCE THAT EMERGES THAT SUPPORTS. IT OKAY. THE PROJECT. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS RIGHT MISTER SO I THANK YOU FOR THIS FORTY CERTAINLY WORKING WITH US OF THIS THIRTY OUT THAT- I WANNA PUT THE QUESTION OF THE OPPOSITION- YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THERE ARE NO CIRCUMSTANCES HISTORICALLY BEFORE TWO THOUSAND TWO UNDER WHICH A STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CAN BE TOLD- BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A MEDICAL. THE STATURE LIMITATIONS CAN BE TOLD- IF- AN INJURED PERSON CANNOT REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO HAVE DISCOVERED THEIR INJURY- GIVEN THE PROPONENTS ARGUMENTS ABOUT TO- OF THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF TRAUMA. IS THERE NOT A CASE TO BE MADE FOR TOLLING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME OR YOU SIMPLY SANKA A BLANKET TOLLING IT'S AN APPROPRIATE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION TO DEAL WITH TYPICAL LEON STATURE LIMITATIONS THAT INCLUDES A DISCOVERY PERIOD AS YOU AMENDED THE LAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO INCLUDE THAT THREE YEAR DISCOVERY PERIOD FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY- CONCERNED WITH YOU KNOW- WHAT'S ALREADY IN COMMON LAW COURT MADE LAW IN. TERMS OF HAVING TOTALING FOUR FIFTY FOR EXAMPLE FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT- THERE'S TYPICALLY YOU KNOW STE- YOU. DOCTOR AND THAT WILL ALLOW COURTS TO TOLD CERTAIN CLAIMS WHEN SOMETHING REACHES THAT LEVEL SO THERE THERE YES THERE THERE IS- AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO DO IT. BUT REVIVING CLAIMS YOU KNOW THAT GOES DECADES BACK WITHOUT MAKING THOSE KINDS OF SHOWING. SHOWINGS IS WHAT WHAT CONCERNS US MOST. I FELT THAN YOUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE PERIOD OF TIME- AND TO- AND THE- MOUNT OF EVIDENCE THAT THAT'S REQUIRED IT'S BASED ON I'D SAY NUMBER ONE. REVIVING CLAIMS THEY HAVE ALREADY EXPIRED- AND NUMBER TWO. THE AMOUNT OF TIME GUESTS GOING BACK THAT THERE'S STILL CUT OFF WHATSOEVER IN THIS CAN GO BACK DECADES. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE COMMENTS ALL RIGHT. PHYSICS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE YEARS. IT'S A BIT OF A SCATTERED APPROACH IN SORT O CERTAIN AREAS AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL AND WHITE NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD. IS IT'S- MORE. APPROPRIATELY BROADLY TRYING TO TAKE IN THESE KINDS OF CASES AND- IT IS A BIT ASTONISHING TO THE OF THE SENSE THE OPPOSITION SAYING AS LONG AS SOMEBODY CAN WAIT OUT HEINOUS ACTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT. AND WHETHER IT'S IN THE CRIMINAL CASES WHICH WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH OR THE CIVIL CASES WHICH IS THIS BILL. THERE NEEDS TO BE. AND ABILITY FOR A PARTY WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH SUCHA HEINOUS EXPERIENCE TO BRING THAT FORWARD AND REALLY THAT'S WHAT YOUR BILL IS ABOUT. SO I. APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS AND INSURING THAT WE ARE SETTING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS FOR PEOPLE TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES. WITH THAT. HE MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I A WHOLE HEARTEDLY GREENHOUSE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND YOUR STAFF THOUGHTFULNESS ON WITH SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS AND YOU KNOW I ALSO ONE UNDERSCORE THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ANY LEGAL STANDARD OR BURDEN OF PROOF- WITH REGARD TO ANY CLAIM BROUGHT BEFORE A JUDGE OR COURT- I IT CAN. AB RIGHT WILL. VERY MUCH CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I'M HAPPY TO TAKE IN OTHER IDEAS THOUGHTS WAYS TO MAKE THIS BILL. BETTER FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO I STICK TO MY- MY GOAL IN THIS BILL IS TO PROVIDE A FORCE FOR. FOR VICTIMS WHO EXPERIENCED- AS YOU'VE SAID SOME HEINOUS ACTS. AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF RECOURSE ARE NUMBER ONE JOB IS AS LEGISLATORS IS TO MAKE SURE COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE- AND THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO AND SEEKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A- AN AVENUE FOR JUSTICE- I KNOW IT'S A COMPLICATED POLICY BUT- I PLAN TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO WORK WITH FOLKESTONE COMMITTEE IF ANYONE HAS ANY OTHER THOUGHTS OR QUESTIONS HAPPY TO TAKE THEM. BUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RECENT THAT I WILL TAKE A MOTION. BUT THE- THANK YOU. AND I SECOND THAT THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED CO WROTE PLEASE STONE. AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM AYE DAVIES. KALRA KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN MAINTAIN AYE REYES RIVAS BLOOM M. I. CREA. THE BILL NEEDS TO MORE SOMEONE TO PUT IT ON CALL THANK YOU THANK YOU AND OUR FINAL BILL TODAY ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT MISTER CUNNINGHAM ANIMIZ WICKS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY YEAH. THIRTY RIGHT GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BIRDS I HERE TODAY PRESENT A TWENTY OH EIGHT AND I'D LIKE TO START BY THE STAFF FURTHER HARD WORK ON REFINING THIS BILL AND HE SAID ANALYSIS I THOUGHT IT WAS FINE WORK AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I'LL GIVE THEM EDMUNDS WE ARE THAT WE ARE ACCEPTING NEW MEMBERS THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I'LL BE PRISON THE BILL TODAY AS AMENDED THOSE WITH REFERENCE TO THE- AMENDED VERSION. AFTER THE FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIMONY LAST FALL. AND A PROMINENT FEDERAL COURT CASE THAT CAME DOWN. RECENTLY WE NOW KNOW THAT CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNING THEIR PRODUCTS TO THEIR CHILDREN. IN FACT THIS IS THEIR VERY BUSINESS MODEL- THE REVENUE DEPENDS ON USER ENGAGEMENT ANYTHING THAT CREATES AND ENHANCES YOUR USER ENGAGEMENT WHETHER IT'S A MINOR OR AN ADULT- MAKES THE MORE MONEY. SO IT SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT THEY HAVE. EMPLOYED NEUROSCIENTISTS TO HELP DESIGN ALGORITHMS THAT CREATE MORE MORE EXCESSIVE USE. AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE FOR KIDS HIGHER RATES OF ANXIETY EATING DISORDERS BODY IMAGE ISSUES DEPRESSION LONELINESS THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN COME OUT OF SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOW IT'S NOT ALL BAD I'M NOT SITTING HERE TELLING YOU THAT. EVERY CHILD HAS A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA APP THAT'S NOT THE CASE BUT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION ACCORDING TO META FACEBOOK'S OWN DATA FROM THE WHISTLEBLOWER TESTIMONY. THEY ESTIMATED ABOUT EXCESSIVE USE MEANING. I AM USING THIS AND I WANT TO STOP AND I CANNOT. AND MANIFESTED HARM INCLUDING. THE AFTER MENTIONED ISSUES LIKE EATING DISORDERS. DEPRESSION LONELINESS AT CENTER. 6% OF AMERICAN TEEN USERS TRACE THE DESIRE TO KILL THEMSELVES TO INSTAGRAM. THIS IS FROM FACEBOOK'S ON RESEARCH DAY MANY OF THE TEENS HAVE AN ADDICT'S NARRATIVE ABOUT THEIR USE AGAIN FROM FACEBOOK'S ON RESEARCH. LASTLY QUOTE WE MAKE BODY IMAGE ISSUES WORSE FOR ONE AND THREE TEEN GIRLS. AGAIN FROM THEIR OWN INTERNAL RESEARCH WE NEED TO CHANGE THE INCENTIVE STRUCTURE. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO. SIMPLY PUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A PRODUCT THAT YOU KNOW CHILDREN ARE GOING TO USE. YOU SHOULD AND MUST DESIGN IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T RESULT IN KIDS HAVING TO SEEK PSYCHIATRIC HELP AS A RESULT OF THAT USE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE NOW HOW DO WE DO THAT. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHT DOES THREE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DONE IN LAW ANYWHERE IN AMERICA YET TODAY. FIRST HE CLARIFIED THAT SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE A DUTY. NOT TO ADDICT CHILDREN AND BECAUSE THE MARK. SECOND THE BILL CLARIFIES THAT NEGLIGENCE SUITS ARE AVAILABLE WITH CIVIL PENALTIES POSSIBLE IN A CASE WHERE THERE IS PROVEN HARM TO MINORS AS A RESULT OF ADDICTIVE FEATURES. THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE PRODUCT. AND THIRD AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. TO CREATE SAFE HARBORS FOR COMPANIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE AFTER HERE WITH THIS BILL. IS COMPLIANCE AND PROTECTION OF KIDS. NOT PUNISHMENT. SAFE HARBOR NUMBER ONE SAYS IF IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS AFTER THE BILL TAKES EFFECT. A COMPANY DISABLES FEATURES THAT ARE ADDICTING. OR DETECTIVE THEY ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY PAST PAST ARM COST. SECOND SAFE HARBOR NUMBER TWO SAYS OF A COMPANY FINDS THAT A NEW FEATURE HAPPENS TO BE ADDICTIVE. AND DISABLES IT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS IT ALSO CANNOT BE LIABLE. AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHT SIX TO GIVE PARENTS A REMEDY TO RECOVER THE COST OF DAMAGES DONE TO THEIR CHILDREN BY SOCIAL MEDIA ADDICTION. AND CREATES A MECHANISM TO FINALLY INCENTIVIZE THE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES. BY THE WAY ONLY OF A CERTAIN LARGE LARGE SIZE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT AFTER START UPS HERE. HOW TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AGAIN PUNISHMENTS NOT THE GOAL BUT INCREASINGLY SOCIAL MEDIA AS PART OF OUR TEENS INTERACT WITH THE WORLD. I KEEP IN TOUCH WITH MY FRIENDS IS A- I GUESS MIDDLE AGE MAN NOW. WITH TEXT MESSAGE STRINGS AND SIGNAL. MY KIDS KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR FRIENDS WITH TICTOC A SNAPCHAT. IT'S THE WAY THE WORLD ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR KIDS JUST WENT THROUGH A LONG PERIOD OF SOCIAL ISOLATION IT WAS IMPORTANT TOOL TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR FRIENDS. AND WE'RE NOT TELLING THE COMPANIES THAT YOU CAN'T LET KIDS ON THE PLATFORM YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HEAR FROM SOME OF THE WITNESSES WE'RE GONNA KICK ARC ALL THE KIDS OFTEN NOBODY'S GONNA BE ABLE. NONSENSE THIS BILL DOES NOT TELL A SINGLE COMPANY WHO CAN BE THEY CAN HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD ON OUR PLATFORMS THAT BLACK IT SIMPLY SAYS YOU CANNOT. USE AN ALGORITHM. THAT YOU KNOW IS CAUSING ADDICTION. AND HARM KIDS AND AGAIN THE CAUSE OF ACTION IS LIMITED WHERE THERE IS PROVEN HARM AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUALIFIER. WITH ME TO TEST FIND SUPPORT TODAY'S LARISSA MAY FOUNDER OF HALF THE STORY- WHICH IS A NONPROFIT DEDICATED CHANGING TEAMS RELATIONSHIPS SOCIAL MEDIA. UP AND GET MY KIDS SIGN UP. AND DR RICHARD FREED A PSYCHOLOGIST WHOSE AREA OF FOCUS IS THE TECH INDUSTRY'S USE OF PERSUASIVE DESIGN HOW THAT AFFECTS CHILDREN'S HEALTH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE SPECS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- WANT TO THANK OUR LEAD AUTHOR HERE ON THIS BILL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD YOU KNOW AND I COME HERE AS A JOINT AUTHOR BUT ALSO AS A MOM A MOM OF A FIVE YEAR OLD IN A ALMOST TWO YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL. WHO ARE GROWING UP IN A VERY DIFFERENT TIME THAN WHEN I GREW UP IN WE GREW UP IN THE PRESSURES THAT ARE GONNA BE ON. THOSE TWO LITTLE GIRLS AS THEY BECOME OF AGE AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PLACE IN THE WORLD IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF INSTAGRAM YOU KNOW FACEBOOK AND ALL THE OTHER APPLICATIONS AND REALLY FACEBOOK'S OWN. DATA INTERNAL RESEARCH SPEAKS FOR THE REASON WHY WE NEED TO HAVE THESE TYPES OF PROTECTIONS OF THIS KIND OF RECOURSE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WORLD IN WHICH WE ARE LIVING. UP THEIR OWN DATA SHOWS THE NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF CONSISTENT CONSTANT USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA THEY UNDERSTAND THE ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR PRODUCTS THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PRODUCTS CAN- WE'RE SEVERELY IMPACT YOUNG. PEOPLE'S SELF ESTEEM THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE'S MINDS ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED AND THEIR ABILITY TO- SORT OR PUSH BACK ON SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IMAGERY- IS VERY DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING AND SO I'M A BI PROUD JORDAN JOIN AUTHOR OF THIS BILL WE NEED THIS IT IS OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE. THAT OUR KIDS WHO ARE USING THESE PLATFORMS ARE SAFE- IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY THESE COMPANIES TO ENSURE THAT AND IT'S ART MY HOPE WITH THIS BILL WE WILL GET THEM INTO A BETTER PLACE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT KIND OF ACTION AND HOLD- THESE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE AND CREATED A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WHERE. THEY CAN TO CONTINUE TO. DO THEIR BUSINESS BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT KEEPS OUR CHILDREN SAFE SO WITH THAT AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR SOUND FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CUNNINGHAM AND WICKS FOR YOUR- REMARKABLE LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. MY NAME IS DR RICHARD FREED AND I WROTE THE FIRST MAJOR MEDIA ARTICLE ABOUT THIS. ABOUT THE SOCIAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES USE OF PERSUASIVE DESIGN THAT THESE POWERFUL BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY TECHNIQUES WHICH POLL KIDS ON TO- THEIR PLATFORMS AND- ESSENTIALLY NOT LET THEM GO AND HOW THAT'S CONTRIBUTING. TO A GENERATION OF KIDS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION. SUICIDALITY AND SELF INJURY BUT MOSTLY I AM A CLINICIAN DAY IN AND DAY OUT WORKING WITH FAMILIES. WHO ARE EXPERIENCING- THIS THIS NATIONAL TRAGEDY I AM I GET TO WATCH THAT UNFOLD AMONG AND THIS TRAGEDY IN IN MY OFFICE NEARLY EVERY DAY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA SITES USES POWERFUL. BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE OF PERSUASIVE DESIGN WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY THE USES VERY POWERFUL TOOL AND IT EXPLOITS YOUNG PEOPLE'S. OUR DEVELOPMENTAL AND NEUROLOGICAL VULNERABILITIES PRETEENS TEEN GIRLS ARE REMARKABLY SENSITIVE THEY CAN'T HELP BUT THEY'RE BORN THAT WAY- TO BE I HAVE A FEAR OF SOCIAL REJECTION AND THESE COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY EXPLOIT THAT TO USE THAT TO PULL KIDS ON TO- THEIR SITES AND KEEP THEM THERE. AND THE THAT THE FOUNDER OR THE OF THE SCIENCE OF PERSUASIVE DESIGN HIMSELF SAID THAT THE THAT USING. PERSUASIVE DESIGN IN THAT WAY IS UNETHICAL. IT'S NOT OKAY. FACEBOOK WHISTLEBLOWER FRANCIS HOW CAN EXPLAINS THAT WHEN KIDS USE INSTAGRAM THEIR INTERNAL- DOCUMENTS TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S A IN ATTICS NARRATIVE KIDS USE OF INSTAGRAM IS DESCRIBED WITHIN THE COMPANY AS AN ADDICT'S NARRATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT I SEE PLAY OUT IN IN MY PRACTICE- IT IS KIDS. CAN SUFFER THE GRAVEST CONSEQUENCES THEY CAN BE- DEPRESSED THEY CAN BE CUTTING UP THEIR ARMS- THEY THEY KNOW THAT IT'S- THEY KNOW THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE NOT HEALTHY FOR THEM- THEIR PARENTS KNOW THAT BUT NOBODY CAN STOP IT THE KIDS CAN'T GO TO GET OFF THE SITES AND THAT PARENTS CAN'T.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU OPERATOR WE'LL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TO. OPPOSITION WITNESSES LISTED TYLER SMITH AND DYLAN HOFFMAN BOTH HERE IN THE ROOM SO IF YOU COULD LET THEM BE AT THE TABLE. BECAUSE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS UNTIL HOFFMAN WITH TECHNET AND WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT- AND WHILE THIS DEALS WITH AN INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX ISSUE- WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS DEEPLY FLAWED- AND OF TO HAVE NUMEROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT ALSO FOR CHILDREN ONLINE. WE TAKE THIS ISSUE VERY SERIOUSLY OUR PLATFORMS HAVE STUDIED- ARTIFACTS ON ADOLESCENTS IN ORDER TO TRY TO LIMIT THOSE NEGATIVE IMPACTS- WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THAT ADDRESS THIS ISSUE- WE THINK MORE PRODUCTIVELY THAN THIS BILL- FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS BILL RAISES SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS- I CAN ONLY BRIEFLY TOUCH ON SOME OF THOSE BUT TO THE- WEEK WE BELIEVE IT INFRINGES ON PLATFORMS EDITORIAL DISCRETION- WHICH IS PROTECTED SPEECH- AND ALSO WOULD IMPOSE A SUBSTANTIAL CHILLING EFFECT ON LAWFUL pAMENDMENT CASE LAW ON THIS TOPIC WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD BE- AND EXPENSIVE TAXPAYER FUNDED CASE THAT ULTIMATELY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL LOSE- TURNING TO THE SUBSTANCE THOUGH. I THINK- THE BILL MIS CHARACTERIZES I THINK THE STATE OF THE BODY OF RESEARCH ABOUT THIS BILL- NOTABLY THAT- THERE IS A DIRECT CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA AND DEPRESSION ADOLESCENCE UNDOUBTEDLY IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN SOME POPULATION OF OUR USERS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT- FROM USING SOCIAL MEDIA IT IS ALSO UNDOUBTEDLY TRUE THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT HOWEVER THIS BILLS LIABILITY- A- BURDENS. ALL OF THAT LEGAL LIABILITY ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR THE CAUSATION OF THOSE HARMS- AND BECAUSE THE BAR TO SHOW ADDICTION TO THIS BILL SO LOW. APPOINTED SIMPLY HAS TO SHOW THAT A CHILD USE SOCIAL SOCIAL MEDIA WAS ADDICTED. AND SOME HARM BEFELL THEM IN ORDER TO SHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO OUR PLATFORMS. WE MUST THEN PROVE NOT ONLY THAT WE DID NOT CAUSE THE HARM- BUT THAT WE DIDN'T EXACERBATED AND ANYWAY- I THINK PROVEN THAT NEGATIVE WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR ANY DEFENDANT- THE PENALTIES IN LIABILITY THIS BOAT BILL IMPOSES- ARE EXCESSIVE IT WILL LEAD TO FEWER SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ONLINE SPACE FOR ADOLESCENTS AND FULL STOP. NO COMPANY CAN SHOULDER THIS LEVEL OF LEGAL RISK AND LIABILITY I THINK I MADE A CONSERVATIVE BACK THE ENVELOPE ESTIMATE. I THINK ONE CLASS ACTION CASE- COULD. SEE PENALTIES IN THE REALM OF HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY PLATFORM THAT CAN STOMACH THAT TYPE OF LIABILITY. I THINK- IT'S NOT HYPERBOLE TO SAY SOCIAL MEDIA WON'T EXIST FOR KIDS UNDER EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA IF THIS BILL PASSES- FINALLY SHIPPED INTO THE AMENDMENTS YOU KNOW I THINK BECAUSE OF THE BURDEN SHIFTING I'D- NEED TO REVIEW THE AMENDMENTS IN CONTEXT- BUT- IF THE BURDEN SHIFTING PROVISION IN THE BILL. IS STILL IN THERE I THINK THE PRACTICAL. PRACTICAL EFFECT MEANS THAT. OF THE PLAINTIFFS STILL JUST HAS TO SHOW- ADDICTION IN ORDER TO- MOVE THE CASE FORWARD THEY DON'T HAVE TO SHOW CAUSATION AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD AND A NEGLIGENCE CASE- ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE RETROACTIVITY PIECE IS STILL- IN PLACE. MEANING THAT PARENTS CAN SUE FOR HARMS FROM WELL BEFORE THIS THIS BILL IS ENACTED WHICH I THINK NOT ONLY IS A PENS- TRADITIONS OF FAIRNESS IN AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE BUT- ALSO CREATES AN INCENTIVE TO DELAY. YOUR LAWSUIT- AND AGAIN. JUST WANT TO SAY THERE ARE OTHER BILLS THAT SEEK TO PROTECT KIDS ONLINE- AND THERE ARE OTHER BILLS THAT WOULD HOLD SOCIAL MEDIA CAP COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE- WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL IS A NARROWLY TERREL. TAILORED SOLUTION TO IT WHAT BEGAN IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BUT INCREDIBLY. COMPLEX PROBLEM- THANK YOU YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH THAT'S WITH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF CHAMBER PROGRESS A CENTER LEFT TECHNICIAN ASSOCIATION THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THAT ALL AMERICANS BENEFIT FROM TECHNOLOGICAL LEAPS OUR CORPORATE PARTNERS INCLUDE COMPANIES LIKE MEDICAL GOING TWITTER YET NONE OF OUR PARTNERS HAVE A VOTE OR VETO ANY OF OUR POSITIONS. ONE OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS TOP PRIORITIES IS TO PRO SAFE AND HEALTHY ONLINE COMMUNITIES AND WE NOTICED COMMITTEE SHARES THAT GOAL SOCIAL MEDIA LIKE MANY TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL. IN MANY LEADING SERVICES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO PROMOTE KIDS POSITIVE USE FOR THEIR SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE YOUTUBE KIDS PROVIDE SECURITY EXPERIENCE FOR YOUNGER KIDS USING A COMBINATION OF ALGORITHMS TO MANGLE CARE RATIONS TO MAKE SURE IT ONLY SHOWS CHILD APPROPRIATE VIDEOS. LAST YEAR INSTAGRAM ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL ROLL OUT NEW SETTINGS THAT GIVE TEENS AND PARENTS MORE CONTROL OVER UPS AND CONTENT. INSTAGRAM TODAY STEERS TEAMS WERE SEARCHING FOR THIS ORDER IN TOPICS FOR HELPFUL SUPPORT RESOURCES. TWITTER ANNOUNCED SAFETY WHICH TEMPORARILY BLOCKED ACCOUNTS FOR IF SEVEN DAYS FOR USING POTENTIALLY HARMFUL LANGUAGE. SUCH AS INSULTS ARE HEY FOR MARKS ARE SENDING REPETITIVE OR ANYBODY REPLIES OR MENTIONS. WHAT LEGISLATION AS WELL INTENTIONED IT CAN ACTUALLY WORSEN EXPERIENCE FOR KIDS ONLINE BY THREATENING IMPORTANT SUPPORT NETWORKS LET ME ACCESS TO CONTENT THAT IMPORTANT AS PER FOR KIDS HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN DRIVING KIDS TO SERVICES THAT MAY LACK THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE. AND COVERED BY THE SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WHEN MANY KIDS WERE CONFINED AT HOME LEARNING SOCIAL MEDIA GAVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY CONNECT WITH FRIENDS RELATIVES AND TEACHERS. BY INCREASING PLATFORMS LEGAL LIABILITY FOR CONTENT ONLINE THIS BILL CAN PROP SERVICES TO CRACK DOWN ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTENT THAT CAN PLAY A POSITIVE ROLE FOR KIDS AND TEENS SUCH AS POSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHY EATING. EDUCATION ABOUT RACE RELATIONS SOCIAL JUSTICE AND INFORMATION ON GUN SAFETY. FINALLY WHILE LARGE SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE DONE ESSENTIAL WORK TO MAKE SAFER SPACES FOR KIDS AND TEENS AND DEVOTE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR TO ONLINE CONTENT MODERATION. MANY SMALLER SERVICES HAVE NOT. BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATION ONLY APPLIES TO SERVICES WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE THIS LEGISLATION COULD DRIVE KIDS AWAY FROM BIG FLAP PLATFORMS. AND LEAVE THEM INSTEAD TO SMARTER LESS RESPONSIBLE PLATFORMS NOT COVERED BY THIS BILL. SUCH A SIGNAL. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL EXEMPTED FOR A QUICK MESSAGES APPS MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS TO HAVE VISIBILITY INTO WHAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE DOING ONLINE. OVERALL THESE BILLS RESTRICTION COULD END UP DRIVING KIDS AWAY FROM THE VERY SERVICES HAVEN'T INVESTED THE MOST RESOURCES AND PROTECTING A YOUNG USERS. WE SHARE YOUR GOAL OF PROTECTING KIDS ONLINE YET WE WORRY THIS BILL WOULD EXPOSE KIDS TO A MORE UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT REDUCE KIDS ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE SHARE AND CONNECT TO EACH OTHER AND THE BROADER WORLD. WE AGREE THAT UNHEALTHY CONTENT FOR KIDS IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH IT LIKE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON A MORE TARGETED APPROACH IN AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHT THAT AIMS AT THE HARMS OF SOCIAL MEDIA WHILE ALSO PRESERVING ITS VITAL BENEFITS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ARE THERE OTHERS IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT. C. NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT WE WILL NOT TAKE FURTHER TESTIMONY BUT NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SURE IF YOU ARE AN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR OH EIGHT THE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME ONE FILED BY ZERO. IF YOU ARE AN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR ZERO EIGHT. ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. AND AS A REMINDER IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY FOUR WEEK PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND WE DO HAVE ONE QUEUING UP WITH AN OPERATOR ONE MOMENT. WHAT ELSE ARE PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO NINE THIRTY EIGHT YOU ARE OPEN. HI THERE RYAN WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE ASSOCIATION WHILE WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IN PROTECTING KIDS ONLINE WE OPPOSE AB TWO FOUR OH EIGHT. AND MISTER CHAIR NOBODY ELSE QUEUED UP. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAKE CLOSE ALLIANCE AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISS DAVIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- TO THE AUTHORED THE OPPOSITION STATES THAT THEY FIND THIS MEASURE UNCONSTITUTIONAL CAN YOU SPEAK AS TO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WAS DANCE CONSTITUTION MUSTER. YES AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK. THAT THE COURTS WILL FIND THIS BOOK CONSTITUTIONAL- AND THE REASON I THINK THAT IS THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN A TEST CASE% BROUGHT IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT ARE BROUGHT IN FEDERAL COURT APPEAL TO THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. LEMON V. SNAPCHAT AND THAT. DECISION CAME DOWN LAST YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND I'LL JUST READ THE KEY PART OF THE HOLDING THE COURT ULTIMATELY RULED AGAINST SNAP AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THEY INSTALLED THE SPEEDOMETER FEATURE IN THEIR APPLICATION. SO KIDS WERE DRIVING AROUND AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED AND CHALLENGING EACH OTHER IN SPEED CONTEST USING THE SPEEDOMETER THING AND SOME SOME KIDS TRAGICALLY DIED. THE PARENTS BROUGHT A LAWSUIT- SNAP ARGUED THAT TWO THING- MAINLY THAT SECTION TWO THIRTY- WHICH PROVIDES FEDERAL PREEMPTION FOR. PROTECTION FOR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES THAT- SO THEY CAN'T BE SUED FOR THIRD PARTY CONTENT THE GETS POSTED. THE COURT FOUND SECTION TWO THIRTY DIDN'T APPLY HERE- AND THE RULING SAID IN SHORT SNAP WAS SUED FOR THE PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES OF DESIGNING SNAPCHAT IN SUCH A WAY. THAT IT ALLEGEDLY ENCOURAGED DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR. ORDAINING ACCORDINGLY THE PANEL CONCLUDES THAT SNAP DID NOT ENJOY IMMUNITY FROM THE SUIT UNDER SECTION TWO THIRTY. AS TO THE OTHER POTENTIAL COST TO CHECK THE CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. OUT WE'RE NOT REGULATING CONTENT AT ALL. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT SAYS THE- X. Y. Z. SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY. I KEEP CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO BE POSTED OR MUST ALLOW THAT TO BE POSTED IT. IT SIMPLY BUILDS ON THE EXISTING NEGLIGENCE FRAMEWORK THAT EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA LAW HAS FOR HUNDRED A HUNDRED PLUS YEARS. THAT SAYS YOU CAN'T BE NEGLIGENT IN THE PRODUCT DESIGN IN THE FUTURE YOU IN BED IN THE PRODUCT AND THE LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THERE IS. PROVEN HARM SO I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE- WITH THE STATEMENT THAT THIS IS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL BILL OR SOME. TEST CASE FOR THAT'S GONNA GET STRUCK OUT DOWN BY THE COURTS AND IN. IF IN GENERAL UNDER FIRST AMENDMENT YOURS PRINCE IF THE GOVERNMENT'S NOT TELLING SOMEBODY THEY CAN OR CAN'T SPEAKER WITH THE CANDOR CAN'T SAY THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISN'T A PROBLEM AND THIS BILL DOESN'T DO THOSE THINGS. AND WE ALREADY HAVE A NIGHT CIRCUIT FEDERAL CASE- THAT THIS BILL IS MODELED AFTER- WHERE WE ARE. ON SOLID GROUND SAYING. FEDERAL SECTION TWO THIRTY DOES NOT PREEMPT. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD TRY TO DO. THANK YOU FOR ME WHEN ONE OTHER QUESTION- THE OPPOSITION IF THIS BILL PASSES THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN COULD BE THAT POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA'S TO BE KICKED UP THE PLATFORM- CAN YOU ADDRESS THIS AGAIN IS THAT IT THE BILL. THE BILL JUST DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHO CAN BE LED ON OR NOT BE LED ON A PLATFORM I MEAN THEY CAN STILL ALLOW MINORS TO USE OUR PLATFORM UNDER THIS BILL IT JUST SAYS YOU IF THE BILL BECOMES LAW YOU'VE GOT THREE MONTHS TO DISABLE ADDICTIVE FEATURES- THAT BECAUSE KIDS ARE. AT ABBOTT AND THAT GOES TO YOU KNOW GO AHEAD ADDRESS THE SAFE HARBOR RETROACTIVITY PIECE TO BECAUSE YOUR QUESTION OF TOUCHES ON THAT AS WELL- THE GENERAL NEGLIGENCE STATUTE IN CALIFORNIA IS TWO YEARS SO ANY RETROACTIVITY THAT WOULD APPLY UNDER THE BILL IS LIMITED TO GOING TWO YEARS BACK ONE. TWO THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SAFE HARBOR UNDER THE AMENDED VERSION OF THE BILL- THEY'VE GOT THREE MONTHS FROM DATE OF ENACTMENT AND ANY NEW THING COMES UP THAT THEY SUBSEQUENTLY DISCOVERS THE DESIGN SOME SUPER COOL SCROLL FEATURES ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT HAS LIKE A SLOT MACHINE TYPE EFFECT THAT WASN'T ANTICIPATED ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT THAT THAT IS CAUSING ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR AND HARM BOTH PRONGS MUST BE MET THEN THEY HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO DISABLE THE FEATURE AND AVOID ANY LIABILITY AT ALL. SO I THINK THE RETROACTIVITY TO THE EXTENT EXISTS ONLY GOES BACK TWO YEARS- WE'VE GOT A WELL DOCUMENTED RECORD FROM THE FACEBOOK WAS BLOOD TEST MONEY THAT. BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF WAS DONE KNOWINGLY OF TO SLEEP THAT AT THAT AND THEY'VE GOT A SAFE HARBOR- ON THE ADDICTION DEFINITION PIECE IF I CAN TOUCH ON THAT BRIEFLY BECAUSE IT WAS RAISED AND WE'RE TAKING THE DEFINITION OF ADDICTION ISSUES AND MEDICINE AND MEDICAL SCIENCE MINUTES PATTERNED AFTER THE DEFINITION IN THE- PSYCHIATRIC MANUAL THE DSM- IT I THINK IT'S A GOOD DEFINITION. F THERE WERE PERFECT DEFINITION I WOULD USE A PERFECT DEFINITION BUT. I THINK THIS IS CLOSE TO PERFECT AS WE CAN GET IT AND IT'S ALSO BY THE WAY. IT'S NOT UNLIKE WHAT FACEBOOK WAS AND WAS SAYING AN INSTAGRAM WAS SAYING IS WHAT THEY CALLED EXCESSIVE USE ITS PEOPLE IT'S LIKE A IT'S LIKE GAMBLING IT'S LIKE USE OF ALCOHOL TO THE USE OF TOBACCO IT'S LIKE USE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE LABELS ADDICTION SOMEBODY'S DOING AND THEY WANT TO STOP AND I CAN'T. THAT'S BASICALLY IN LAYMAN'S TERMS WHAT THE DEFINITION OF ADDICTION AND AGAIN THEY HAVE TO NEGLIGENTLY OR INTO THE INTENTIONALLY DO IT. I MADE IT UP SO YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT A LIMITATION IN THE VERY CORE OF THE BILL. AND OF THIS IS RAMBLING INTO MY CLOTHES SESSION PRICE STOP IN. THANK THERE'S OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU THE SERVICE. AND THAT MR BLOOM. THANK YOU RIGHT- ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION UNHEALTHY CONTENT FOR KIDS IS A REAL PROBLEM. I WILL TELL YOU AND DIED I. HAD SHARED I DID HAVE A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT THE FIRST OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF IF SOMEONE IS WILLINGLY. ENTERING OF A PLATFORM A MEDIA PLATFORM. THEY ARE ACCEPTING WHATEVER'S BEING PUT BEFORE THEM BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING BEING DONE INTENTIONALLY. TO ADDICT THEM THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED- I AT IT- THE FACT THAT THEN YOU'VE YOU'VE TOUCHED ON THIS IN RESPONSE TO- IS DAVIS QUESTION ABOUT THE PENALTY BUT IF THEY SHOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE THREE MONTH AUDITS THEY'RE GONNA BE OKAY AND EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE THREE MONTH AUDIT. THEY CAN STILL HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO FIX IT. THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT YOU PUT IN THERE- REGARDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT AS NOTED IN- IN THE COMMITTEES- ANALYSIS. THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE TAKEN MIRROR THE CASE LAW RELATED TO LIABILITY FOR SOCIAL MEDIA. COMPANIES THUS. THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE AT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOUND AGAINST THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND WILL NOT BE FOUND IN CONSTITUTIONAL. BUT ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE ABOUT IT BEING DEEPLY FLAWED OFTENTIMES OUR BILLS BEGIN BEGIN DEEPLY FLAWED AND AS WE HEAR THE COMMENTS AND CLEARLY YOU'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS FROM THE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED- BECAUSE MAYBE OUR BILLS DO BEGIN DEEPLY FLAWED. AND WE MAKE THEM BETTER BECAUSE IN THE END WE WANT TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN. IT ISN'T ABOUT ADULTS IT'S ABOUT THE CHILDREN. THE R. I KNOW THAT MANY PARENTS THE TALK TO ME. THEY TELL ME WE DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS UGH IF THIS IS WHAT THE PARENTS ARE SAYING. WE CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW THE CHILDREN WOULD VOICE THEIR CONCERNS IF THEY EVEN UNDERSTOOD HOW WHAT THE CONCERN IS. I- I AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I DID HAVE SOME CONCERT. SAID CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY AND APPRECIATED THE END RESULT I AND I DO WANT TO. SHARE IF I MAY- MISTER CHAIRMAN- FROM A PARENT WHO IS VERY AWARE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HE SAID AS A DAD OF TWO DAUGHTERS I CAN TELL YOU I AM SO SCARED ABOUT THE NEUROLOGIST HIRED. TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IS BEING DONE TO BECAUSE THIS ADDICTION IN YOUNG GIRLS AND IT'S A SCARY THING FOR HIM- SCARY THING FOR ANY PARENT- I AND WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND THANK YOU AND THE SECONDS LIST BELOW. I'VE JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR WHAT MIGHT BE SO EASY TO ANSWER- BUT YOU RAISE THE FOR THE OPPOSITION YOU RAISE THE- ISSUE OF FOLK OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF IS THEIR CASE LAW THIS COMES DOWN TO THE WRITING OF ALGORITHMS IS THERE CASE LAW ESTABLISHING THAT AN ALGORITHM- IS PROTECTED BY THE FIRST AMENDMENT. MAY I PLACE THAT IN THE ANALYSIS YEAH I BELIEVE SO AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE CASE CITATIONS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTERWARDS BUT THERE IS CASE LOS SHOWING THAT- THE WAY THAT. PUBLISHERS SHOULD CHOOSE TO SHOW CONTENT IS PROTECTED SPEECH AND THAT INCLUDES OUR ALGORITHMS- AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT IS A PROTECTED FORM OF SPEECH IN ONE OF I THINK THE ISSUES THAT AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL IS- IT IS. IMPACTING SPEECH AND LIKE OUR SPEECH AS A PLATFORM- IN THAT REGARD SO YES AT THE END APOLOGIZE I'LL HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU AFTER WITH THE CASE ADDITION. SO I'M GOING TO ASK A VOTE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD TODAY BUT I DO HAVE- SOME ABIDING CONCERNS- ABOUT- THE- WAY THIS BILL WOULD WORK IN THE- IN THE REAL WORLD AND THE IMPACT THAT IT WOULD. THAT IT WOULD HAVE ON THEIR- HAVE BEEN ADDICTIVE GAMES THAT PREDATE TO- THE INTERNET- DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS IS THE ONE THAT COMES TO MIND TO FROM- MY GENERATION. AND IT CAN BE DONE RIGHT- IT AND TO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT HERE AND TO I'M GONNA RESERVE MY RIGHT TO. VOTE DIFFERENTLY ON THE FLOOR BUT- FOR NOW I THINK YOU'RE ONTO A VERY- IMPORTANT ISSUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- I HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TO REACH SOME ACCOMMODATIONS. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT THIS CUNNINGHAM DURING THIS WEEK'S ISN'T HERE BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AT THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT NOR SHOULD BE AFRAID OF. CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS THE POINT OF THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD BILLS LIKE THIS I WOULD JUST SAY THIS FOR THE RECORD MORE GENERALLY. IS TO CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO AND TO PUT BEING SURE THAT WE ARE PUSHING FORWARD IN AREAS THAT WE FEEL. ARE IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADVANCE I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU ARE RAISING A- A POLICY QUESTION AN AREA THAT REALLY HAS NOT BEEN. THOROUGHLY LITIGATED AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONTENTS AND ALGORITHMS IN THE OPPOSITION KEEPS TALKING ABOUT CONTENT AND YES THERE IS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ALGORITHM THAT IS. PUSHING THE CONTENT OUT THERE IN THE CONTENT ITSELF IN THIS BILL I DON'T SEE IS AS- REGULATING THE CONTENT BUT THE MECHANISMS THE ALGORITHMS IN THE FEATURES BEHIND THAT. THAT ARE SERVING UP THE AIR AND TAKING DATA AND INFORMATION FROM THE USERS AND THEN FIGURING OUT HOW TO SERVE UP WHAT THEN THAT INDIVIDUAL IS SEEING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUTH AND INDIVIDUALS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT SUBJECT HERE MEAN IT CAN BE. AND IS AS HARMFUL AS AS OFTEN SHOWS UP IN. THAT IN THE MEDIA AT AND AS HAS BEEN PORTRAYED BUT WITH THIS BILLS REALLY GOING AFTER IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PLATFORMS AND THAT IS. THE INTENTIONAL TARGETING AND THE INTENTIONAL CREATION OF ALGORITHMS AND FEATURES THAT ARE DRIVING. ADDICTIVE REALLY REPRODUCTIVE RESULTS IN IN OUR YOUTH. WE'RE STILL GRAPPLING WITH ADDICTION WHEN IT COMES TO DRUGS AND THAT'S WHAT MOST PEOPLE THINK OF CERTAINLY GAMBLING AND OTHERS BUT THESE PLATFORMS ARE INCREDIBLY ADDICTIVE AND INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND UNFORTUNATELY. IN OUR SOCIETY THE WAY WE TEACH BOYS AND GIRLS AND IT. IS FEEDING INTO A LOT OF THE ANXIETIES THAT THAT THERE. EXPERIENCING WHEN THEY GET ONTO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS BUT WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE DOING THE RESEARCH IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP KIDS ADDICTED AND HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT PLATFORMS BUSINESS MODEL IS SUCCESSFUL BY TYING PEOPLE TO THEM IN WAYS THAT THEY CAN'T SEPARATE FROM AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO KIDS THAT IS VERY MUCH ALARMING. AND THE TECH INDUSTRY HAS ALL OFTEN COME TO THIS LEGISLATURE SAYING NO WE'RE DIFFERENCE NO WE'RE SPECIAL DON'T REGULATORS DON'T TOUCH US BECAUSE WE'RE INNOVATIVE AND WE'D WHATEVER APPROPRIATE BUZZ WORDS THAT THEY WANT TO THROW OUT BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT ALTERNATELY THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY AND THE COURTS IN THE LARGE STARTING TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION WHETHER IT'S AN ONLINE MARKETPLACE OR FUNCTIONS THAT THAT DRIVE INTENTIONALLY DRIVE ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR FOR THE PURPOSE THEN OF THE VIABILITY OF THAT PLATFORM THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS OF FOR US TO WEIGH IN AND TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE IN THIS CUNNINGHAM UNITE THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. THE ROLE THE APPROPRIATE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN LEVELING PLAYING FIELD AND IN LOOKING OUT FOR THE WHOLE BASIS FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS ARE. LOOKING OUT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ENSURING THAT THAT THINGS ARE SAFE. SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS RAISED AND THINK THE ANALYSIS. REALLY TALKS ABOUT SOME OF THIS BECAUSE DEFINITIONAL LEE WERE STEPPING INTO AREAS THAT THAT STILL NEED TO NEED TO BE SORTED OUT WE CAN'T SORT THOSE OUT WITHOUT PUTTING A BILL LIKE THIS FORWARD LEGISLATURE AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE. BEING AS RESPONSIVE AS WE CAN TO. CHANGING TECHNOLOGIES ALLOW THOSE TO MOVE FORWARD BY BEING HONEST WITH OURSELVES ABOUT THE DANGERS THAT ARE. OUT THERE AND ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS AND IT'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN THE WILD WEST FOR A LONG TIME IT'S NOT THE WILD WEST ANYMORE IT NEEDS A LITTLE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT. AND TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CIVILIZED AND JUST SAY TO COME TO LEGISLATURE THEY DON'T TOUCH US BECAUSE WE'RE SPECIAL DOES NOT HOLD WATER ANYMORE. TO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THE THOUGHTFULNESS. THE WAY THAT YOU APPROACH THIS BILL AND PROVIDED SOME SAFEGUARDS SAFE HARBORS AND SOME POTENTIAL OFF RAMPS FOR THEIR I'D- I'M NOT ONE WHO. WANT TO SEE SOMEONE WHO IS PERPETUATING HARM TO BE LET OFF THE HOOK BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PROTEIN THIS AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE VAGARIES WITH THAT THAT SOMETIMES WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE BECAUSE WE WE'RE WE'RE JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM AND THESE COMPANIES ARE WELL AHEAD OF US. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. WITH ALGORITHM GENERATION. AND A WORD SPARKS TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT. WHAT I THINK THIS BILL DOES IN THE FRAMEWORK THAT YOU SET UP IS VERY APPROPRIATE AND I APPRECIATE. AGAIN THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE PUT IN TO THIS. THANK YOU WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT FAIRLY BRIEF- ONE TECHNICAL THING UNDER THE AMENDED VERSION THE BILL THERE'S NO BURDEN SHIFTING THE BURDEN REMAINS WITH. THE PLAN F. LIKE ANY OTHER LAWSUIT- ADELINE MY COMMENTS WITH THE CHAIRS ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT QUESTION. I THINK THIS PASSES MUSTER AS DRAFTED. IF THEY HAVE CASE LAW WERE OF THERE'S AN- FIRST AMENDMENT ANALYSIS ON AN ALGORITHM OR PRODUCT DESIGN FEATURE. OUR COURTS STRUCK THAT DOWN A FIRST MAN GROUNDS I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THE LINE IN CASE IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND WE ARE. CRAFTING THIS BILL DRAFTING RIGHT BEHIND THE NINTH CIRCUIT JURISPRUDENCE. I AM HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CASE LAW IF THEY CAN COME UP THE SITES. AND GIVE IT ITS DUE APPROPRIATE INSPECTION. I AM IS ABOUT A PRO FIRST AMENDMENT PROCESS AS YOU'RE GOING TO FIND. ON THE PLANET IT'S BEEN EIGHTEEN YEARS AS A- LEGAL PRACTITIONER DEFENDING PEOPLE'S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS I'VE- I AM NOT IMPINGING ON PEOPLE'S RIGHTS OF EXPRESSION THAT'S AN IMPORTANT IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS- BUT I AM A 100% CONFIDENT HAVING SAID THAT THAT WHAT WE HAVE- PASSES MUSTER ON THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN FACT. THIS IS A PRODUCT SAFETY BILL IT'S A PRODUCT DESIGNED BILL THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS. AND IT'S PROTECTING KIDS IN THIS LIMITED TO KIDS. AND I WOULD SHARE AS- MS RESTS ALLUDED TO AND SHE- PUT IT BETTER THAN I HAVE IN THE PAST. AS A PARENT I GOT THREE TEENAGERS THAT A SECOND GRADER. THIS IS ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY BUT I CAN TELL YOU HER COMMENT THE PARENTS ON'T STAND A CHANCE. IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I AM TRY TO BE A DECENT LAWYER AND SUNDAYS ON THE DECENT LEGISLATOR AND MOST DAYS I'M A PRETTY GOOD PARA AT LEAST I TRY I AM NOT A SOFTWARE ENGINEER I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IF I LET MY KIDS ON TICK TOCK OR SNAPCHAT OR INSTAGRAM OR WHAT HAVE YOU I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT. THOSE COMPANIES ARE DOING IT WITHOUT MORE THAN JUST TO GET MY KIDS TO USE IT MORE MORE MORE I EVEN IF I DID I WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DISABLE IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T DESIGN THE FEATURE IN THE FIRST PLACE AND AGAIN I'M NOT A SOFTWARE ENGINEER SO THAT REALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS ARGUMENT HAS COME UP BEFORE WILL WHERE IS THE PARENTS RESPONSIBILITY WELL. YOU KNOW AS PARENTS ARE FIRST DUTIES ALL. TO PROTECT OUR KIDS. BUT LET'S BE REALISTIC BECAUSE- I ME KEEPING YOUR KIDS OFF THE STUFF IN THE MODERN ERA IS NOT FEASIBLE. AND THE- THE COMPANIES ARE THE ONES THAT KNOW. EVAN FLOYD THE NEUROLOGISTS AND NEUROSCIENTISTS AND THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. TO DESIGN ALGORITHMS AND THEY'RE THE ONES THAT THIS BILL WOULD PUT THE ONUS ON. TO DISABLE THOSE FEATURES OR- CRAFT THEM IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE. BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN. AND NOT. POTENTIALLY OR ACTUALLY IN FACT HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. AND UNLESS WE HAVE A LOT LIKE THIS. D. C. ISN'T TAKING ACTION ON THIS. THERE'S BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO HAPPEN. BUT GUESS WHAT'S COME OUT OF WASHINGTON NOTHING. YOUR CALIFORNIA CAN LEAD THE WAY HERE I MEAN WE CAN AND- THEY ARE NOT GONNA KICK KIDS OFF THE PLATFORM I DON'T BUY IT FOR A SECOND. I MEAN IS MILLIONS OF MILLIONS OF KIDS ON THESE ON THESE PLATFORMS. WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO IF THIS BECOMES LAW. IT'S FIX THE FEATURES THAT ARE CAUSING HARM THROUGH ADDICTION TO KIDS AND THEY CAN DO IT THEY HAVE THE WORLD'S SMARTEST ENGINEERS WORKING FOR THEM MAKING TONS OF MONEY. TWO GENERATIONS AGO THESE ENGINEERS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUTTING MAN ON THE MOON. AND TODAY THEY'RE DESIGNING PRODUCT IT'S LIKE A SLOT MACHINE THE GETS A THIRTEEN YEAR OLD ADDICTED AND IN SOME CASES THAT LEADS TO THEM GOING. TO RESIDENTIAL REHAB PROGRAMS. LIKE A FRIEND OF MINE. SO I THINK RESPECTFULLY WE NEED THIS BILL. THEY'VE HAD. A DECADE OR MORE OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE ISSUE AND FIX THE PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT. AND I REALLY ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO LEAD THE WAY AND PROTECTING YOUR KIDS ONLINE. THANK YOU.
