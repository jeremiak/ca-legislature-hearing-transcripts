00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.133
THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTIAL IS

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.301
REAL AND IT'S BIG.

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:52.136
IF FOR INSTANCE MANY OF OUR

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:53.871

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:55.139
WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH THE

STATE ON A NUMBER OF VARIOUS

00:37:56.941 --> 00:37:58.142

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:06.417

00:38:06.484 --> 00:38:08.019
IF THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.120
THOSE INCENTIVES IN OF THE

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:10.354
PROJECT NOW TRIGGER TO INNER

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:11.656
CITY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:13.591

RESIDENTIAL REAL.

00:38:28.105 --> 00:38:29.874
I THINK THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS --

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.941

AUTHOR TALK ABOUT RESIDENTIAL I

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:35.579
THINK WE CAN CARVE IT OUT OR WE

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:37.648

BEAT BY THE D. I. R..

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.521
THEY HAVE COME FORWARD AND SO

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:45.322
THEY DON'T USE THERE'S A PROBLEM --

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:46.390
