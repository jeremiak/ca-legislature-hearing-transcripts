THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS FOR GRANTED PRIOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK ON A GERMAN MEMORY. MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR ADJOURN IN MEMORY. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- AS WE CELEBRATE. IRISH HERITAGE MONTH. THIS WEEK I ASK THAT WE CLOSE IN THE MEMORY OF A CALIFORNIA IRISHMAN AN AMERICAN SON. ROBERT BRENDAN GALLAGHER. MY GRANDFATHER. ROBERT BOB GALLAGHER WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY SIX INTO A CALIFORNIA FARMING FAMILY. HE WAS THE GRANDSON OF ANTHONY GALLAGHER AN EARLY PIONEER TO CALIFORNIA. ONE OF HIS EARLIEST MEMORIES WAS HELPING OUT HIS FATHER ED. AND GRANDFATHER ON THE FAMILY FARM. HE REMEMBERED HIS GRANDMOTHER MERRY ALLEN AS BEING THE HEART OF THE FAMILY ORCHESTRATING ALL THE DEMANDS OF A FARMSTEAD IN PROVIDING FOR THE NEEDS. FOR THE FAMILY AND FARM HANDS. WHEN HE WAS YOUNG HE BECAME VERY SICK AND IT WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER WHO WAS BY HIS BEDSIDE AND NURSED HIM BACK TO HEALTH. BOB WAS ALWAYS VERY ATHLETIC IN INTO SPORTS. HE PLAYED FOOTBALL GOING ON TO PLAY ON THE FRESHMAN SQUAD. FOR ST MERRY'S GALLOPING GAELS. HIS EDUCATION WAS CUT SHORT BY WORLD WAR TWO LIKE MANY OF HIS GENERATION HE ANSWERED THE CALL AND JOINED THE ARMY AIR CORPS. HIS FIRST STOP WAS DENVER COLORADO AND IT WAS THERE THAT HE MET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE MERION BALLAST. THEY MET AT A US SO DANCE HALL EVENT. MY GRANDFATHER HAD GRIT AND DETERMINATION IN SPADES. ANAGRAM THAT DREW YOU AND. THAT WAS ON FULL DISPLAY THAT NIGHT. WHEN HE FOUND OUT THAT MY GRANDMOTHER WAS ALREADY ENGAGED TO ANOTHER HE TOLD HER FLAT OUT TAKE THAT RING OFF YOUR FINGER BECAUSE I'M GOING TO MARRY YOU. THERE MUST TO WORK BECAUSE SHORTLY THERE AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED. AFTER THE WAR THEY WERE OFF BACK TO CALIFORNIA IN THE FAMILY FARM WHERE THEY ESTABLISHED THEIR HOME AND RAISE SEVEN CHILDREN. JUDY ROBERTA DENNIS DIANE KELLY. TRICK IN. TEN IT WAS A GOOD LIFE ONE OF HARD WORK FAMILY AND FUN BOB AND MARION LED TO DANCE AND THEN WE GO TO THE ROBINSON'S CORNER IN GRIDLEY WITH THEIR FRIENDS FOR A NIGHT OF DANCING. AFTER MARION BOB'S GREATEST PASSION WAS BASEBALL. HE COULD HIT EVERY PART OF THE FIELD IT WAS AN EXCELLENT CENTER FIELDER. HE PLAYED ON SEVERAL SEMI PRO TEAMS LOCAL TEAMS RETIRED WHEN HE WAS FORTY YEARS OLD. THE YUBA CITY BEARS TWIN CITIES GIANTS YUBA SUTTER REBELS. AND HE SPENT MANY A POSTGAME AT THE EAGLE'S NEST A LOCAL GATHERING PLACE- THAT WAS OWNED BY OUR VERY OWN DEBRA. GRANDFATHER NICK FITS. AT THE END OF HIS PLAYING CAREER. THE TEAM'S HONORED HIM WITH THE BOB GALLAGHER NIGHT AT BRYAN FIELD IN MARYSVILLE. AND THE YEAR BEFORE HE PASSED HE GOT TO THROW OUT THE FIRST PITCH ON THAT VERY SAME FIELD. PERHAPS THE SECOND CLOSE. TO BASEBALL WAS POLITICS. LIKE MANY IRISH CATHOLICS. HE WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY OF DEMOCRATS. BUT JUST AS THE IRISH CAME OVER FROM AMERICA BOB GALLAGHER BROUGHT THE FAMILY OVER TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AN IRISHMAN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AS HE LIKE TO SAY IT WAS PAT BROWN THAT MADE HIM A REPUBLICAN. HE VOTED. HE BELIEVED IN PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE OBLIGATION TO GIVE BACK. PROVIDING LEADERSHIP ON THE LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD AND EVENTUALLY BEING ELECTED TO THE SUTTER COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX. HE HELPED SPEARHEAD THE SPEARHEAD THE FIRST CAMPAIGN. OF OUR LONG TIME CONGRESSMAN WALLY HERGER. A LIFELONG FRIEND AND SERVED AS THE COUNTY CHAIRMAN OF SUTTER COUNTY DURING THE TWO THOUSAND THREE. RECALL OF GRAY DAVIS. HE WAS MY MENTOR IN SO MANY WAYS HE HAD SOME GREAT SAYINGS LIKE. DON'T PUT YOUR MOUTH IN GEAR BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR BRAIN IN GEAR. I STILL NEED TO LISTEN TO THAT ONE. HE WOULD TELL ME THAT YOU THAT YOU NEED TO BE GOOD AND ABLE TO TALK ON YOUR FEET. AND YOU WOULD ADMIT HE WAS NEVER REALLY GOOD AT THAT. HE WAS A MAN OF FEW WORDS. BUT HE MEANT WHAT HE SAID AND HE SAID WHAT HE MEANT. OVER THE YEARS HE WELCOMED AS TREASURED GAS PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND POLITICAL PERSUASIONS. AND EVEN WITH THAT AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARGUED WHICH WAS OFTEN. HE KEPT THEM COMING BACK FOR MORE. HE LOVED THIS COUNTRY. HE WOULD ALWAYS ENCOURAGE US NOT TO TAKE OUR FREEDOMS FOR GRANTED. TO HONOR OUR VETERANS AND THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN THEIR LIVES FOR LIBERTY. ONE OF HIS FAVORITE PLACE IS A TRAP TRIP TRAVEL IS BRANSON MISSOURI BECAUSE OF THE MANY PATRIOTIC SHOWS. AND THE BIG BAND MUSIC THAT REMINDED HIM OF HIS TIMES OF MY GRANDMOTHER. HE BELIEVES IN TREATING A MAN FAIRLY AND FIGHTING FOR A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE. I THINK THAT'S AN ESPECIALLY IRISH TRADE. HANDED DOWN THROUGH THE GENERATIONS MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE OF HOW MY ANCESTORS WERE TREATED BACK IN IRELAND. WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO OWN LAND AND WORK THE GROUND FOR A PITTANCE. OR HOW WE WERE TREATED WHEN WE FIRST CAME TO AMERICA. MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIS GRANDMOTHER. HE TREATED THOSE WHO WORK FOR HIM LIKE FAMILY. AND UNDER HIS WATCH EVERYONE PROSPERED AT THE GALLAGHER RANCH. HE BELIEVED IN EDUCATION MAY BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT TO FINISH HIS. HE WOULD HOUND US ALL THE TIME ABOUT GETTING OUR DEGREE. TWO OF HIS DAUGHTERS BECAME TEACHERS AND EDUCATION LEADERS. HE LOVED HIS FAMILY HE WAS PROUD OF ALL OF HIS CHILDREN GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRAND CHILDREN AND FOLLOWED ALL OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS HIS FAVORITE PLACE WAS ANYWHERE. THEY WERE GATHERED. HE WAS STRONG. HE PERSISTED THROUGHOUT VERSATILE ON THE FARM AND HIS FAMILY HE WAS THE ROCK THAT WE COULD ALWAYS COUNT ON. FOR NINETY FOUR YEARS A LIFE OF PURPOSE. A LEGACY OF FAITH AND FAMILY. WE WILL MISS HIM DEARLY BUT WE KNOW THAT HE IS IN A PLACE WHERE THE SUN SHINES UPON HIS FACE. AND THE WIND IS ALWAYS AT HIS BACK. KATE MILLER FOGGIA GODSPEED TO OUR DEAR BOB. MEMBERS I ASK THAT WE ADJOURN IN HIS TREASURED MEMORY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER.

HE EMBODIED EVERY PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM. HE IS DESCRIBED BY HIS FAMILY AS A REMARKABLE MAN KNOWN TO. KNOWN TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVERYTHING AND EFFORTLESSLY NAVIGATE CONVERSATIONS FROM BASEBALL TO HISTORY TO BOXING TO POLITICS AND WORLD AFFAIRS. I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM AT A DODGERS VERSUS GIANTS GAME IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN I THREW THE FIRST PITCH HE AND HIS SON JARED WHO IS PART OF MY LONG TIME S. YEAH YOU FAMILY.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO YOUR RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR ADJOURNMENT MEMORY. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY BECAUSE MY CITY HAS LOST A VERY BRIGHT LIGHT. AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY ADVOCATE AND A LEADER WHO SHAPE SAN FRANCISCO AND THE BAY AREA INTO WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. AND HOSTED. BORN IN WEST VIRGINIA DURING WORLD WAR TWO. GROWING UP IN THE MIDWEST BEFORE GRADUATING FROM DUKE SHE MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHERE SHE BEGAN HER LIFELONG QUEST TO BUILD COMMUNITY. THROUGH IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT BRIDGING CULTURAL DIVIDES AND ADVANCING OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN. MANY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS- THEIR EXISTENCE TO AN- SHE WAS A CHARTER MEMBER OF THE OPEN SPACES COMMITTEE WHERE SHE WAS APPOINTED BY THEN MAYOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN. FOR GUIDANCE ON OUR CITY'S NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS COUNCIL. HAS INSPIRED THE UPKEEP OF OUR CITIES PARKS AND GREENERY TODAY. IF YOU EVER HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A WALK DOWN SAN FRANCISCO OF WORLD FAMOUS WATERFRONT. YOU'LL ALSO SEE ANN'S LEGACY. AS A METROPOLITAN FROM TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONER AND A MEMBER OF THE NORTHWEST. WATERFRONT ADVISORY GROUP AND TRANSFORM THE EMBARCADERO PARK BOULEVARD RESTORED THE FERRY BUILDING HELPED CONCEIVE THE BOOK OF THE BLUE GREEN WAY. SHE WAS ALSO AN INCREDIBLE CHAMPION FOR WOMEN. SHE FOUGHT FOR GENDER EQUITY IN OUR WORK IN HUMAN RESOURCES WHERE SHE WORKED TO CHANGE CORPORATE CULTURE FROM WITHIN. SHE SPENT YEARS SUPPORTING FEMALE POLITICIANS ON THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S CAMPAIGN FUND BOARD. THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS APTLY RECOGNIZED HER AS ONE OF THE WOMAN. WHO COULD BE PRESIDENT. I GOT TO KNOW WHEN WE SERVED TOGETHER ON THE BOARD OF THE CHINATOWN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT CENTER. SHE WAS AN AMAZING BRIDGE BUILDER BETWEEN OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. SUCH SO THAT MANY OF US CONSIDER HER TO BE AN HONORARY MEMBER OF OUR CHINESE COMMUNITY. BUT MORE BROADLY SHE WAS A LEADER. IF I WERE TO READ THE NAMES OF THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHE LED. IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR. JUST A FEW EXAMPLES SHE WAS A SAN FRANCISCO REDEVELOPMENT COMMISSIONER. SHE WAS PRESIDENT OF OUR CITY'S PORT COMMISSION. VICE CHAIR OF THE BAY CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION. AND SPENT TWELVE YEARS ON THE METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. IN HER ORAL HISTORY CAPTURED BY THE UC BANCROFT LIBRARY. AND SAID THAT SHE PURSUED FREE THEMES TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY. TO FIND ISSUES THAT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. TO MAXIMIZE DIVERSITY AND PROBLEM SOLVING AND TO BUILD ALLIANCES WITHIN COMMUNITY. IF THIS BODY PURSUED ALL OF THOSE THINGS OUR STATE WOULD BE A FAR BETTER PLACE. LET ME END BY SAYING WHAT I WILL MISS THE MOST ABOUT OUR FRIEND IN. IS OUR COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE. HER MODESTY AND HUMBLE SPIRIT. FOR ABILITY TO LEAD WITHOUT EGO. FOR ALL OF US WHO KNEW HER HER SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON IN SO MANY NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES I WANT EXPRESS MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO OUR PARTNER WAS WITH ME. HER EXTENDED FAMILY OF MANY FRIENDS ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT WE JOURNAL HER MEMORY. REST IN PEACE AND- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAIN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR GERMAN MMORY. THEY HAVE A SPEAKER I ALSO WANT TO RISE AND ASKED THAT WE ADJOURN IN THE MEMORY OF AND HALLSTATT- I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO DID AN AMAZING JOB REALLY RECITING. ALL THE DIFFERENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT SHE HAS. DONE MADE. THERE'S REALLY NOT A BOARD THERE'S NOT AN ORGANIZATION. THAT SHE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LAND USE AND THE SKYLINE OF OUR AMAZING CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. IN FACT SHE WAS ALWAYS THE ONE THE REAL CITIZEN WHO WAS CONSTANTLY WORKING ON THESE ISSUES UP TO THE MOMENT THAT SHE PASSED AWAY. I BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS THE CITIZEN THAT WAS- THE GO TO PERSON ON THESE ISSUES BECAUSE SHE WAS TIRELESS. SHE WORKED NONSTOP HER DESIRE TO MAKE A CHANGE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CITY- WAS ALWAYS. MOVING FORWARD WAS ALWAYS ABLE TO BUILD BE YET WAS PRESERVING ARE VERY PRECIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS I CAN REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I HAD. COFFEE WITH HER AND HER HUSBAND WELLS AND IS VERY APPROPRIATE AT A COFFEE SHOP IN NORTH BEACH IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE CONSTANTLY. FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT THAT NORTH BEACH COMMUNITY WAS PRESERVED AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE REST OF THE CITY WAS ALLOWED TO GROW. SHE IS SOMEONE WHO IS THE ULTIMATE SAN FRANCISCO CITIZENS. SHE WILL DEFINITELY BE MISSED. SHE'S SOMEONE WHO HAS A LEGACY COMES FROM- FORTY TO SIXTY YEARS OF OUR TIRELESS WORK. AND FOR THAT I ASKED THAT WE ADJOURN IN MEMORY I FOUND HOSTED.
