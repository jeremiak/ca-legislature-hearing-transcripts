ONE SEVEN SEVEN ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STERN COLLEAGUES -- THIS BILL PROPOSAL IS WITH RESPECT TO MAKING ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN OTHER STATES IN. THE UNION THAT ALREADY HAVE ELECTION DAY AS A HOLIDAY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. A KEY ASPECT TO ENSURING AS MUCH REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY IN PARTICIPATION AS POSSIBLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW HAS LEAD IN THIS EFFORT TO MAKE. VOTING AS MUCH EASIER IN THAT MUCH PARTICIPATE. WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE I HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO ALSO WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND ASK THEMSELVES TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES FOR IT. PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DAN AL PER AND I AM A SENIOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY AND I ALSO SERVED AS THE VOTE COALITION DIRECTOR. FOR THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO DO FULL TESTIMONY THIS TIME OR JUST. JUST MONIES GREAT GREAT YEAH OKAY -- SO AS THE VOTE COALITION DIRECTOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY -- WHICH REPRESENTS THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ABOUT THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN TOTAL ON THIS PAST FALL I LED THE MAIN VOTER REGISTRATION AND GET OUT TO VOTE EFFORTS ON CAMPUS WHICH LED TO THE REGISTRATION OF OVER TWO THOUSAND NEW STUDENTS WHICH WAS THE HIGHEST REGISTRATION NUMBER ON RECORD. FOR MID TERM ELECTION AT UC BERKELEY -- I'M HERE TO SPEAK BRIEFLY TO ALL TODAY -- BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE MID TERM ELECTION SEASON -- I NOTICED A LARGER MORE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM TO VOTING I'M ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS THAT I WANTED TO SEE ADDRESSED AND I BELIEVE THE AB ONE SEVENTY SEVEN SIX RESOLVE ONE OF THOSE PROBLEMS. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT MAKING ELECTION DAY A STATE HOLDING CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA SO HISTORICALLY LOW VOTER TURNOUT. PARTICIPATED IN THE PRIMARY AND PARTICIPATED IN THE GENERAL ELECTION. STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN DON'T VOTE IS A LACK OF TIME. DATA AGGREGATED BY THE WASHINGTON POST IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE PURE RESEARCH CENTER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND THE U. S. CENSUS IN ELECTION YEARS. HAVE ALL FOUND THE COMMONLY CITED REASON FOR NOT VOTING WAS BEING TOO BUSY OR HAVING A CONFLICTING WORK AND SCHOOL SCHEDULE. A TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN TOUGH SURVEY ALSO SHOWED SIMILAR RESULTS FOR STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY AS THE MOST COMMONLY CITED REASON AMONG YOUNG REGISTERED VOTERS FOR NOT VOTING WAS AGAIN HAVING SCHEDULING CONFLICTS. I COULD SHARE CITY EXIT STATISTICS WITH YOU ALL DAY BUT WHAT'S JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THESE NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE STATISTICS THE PEOPLE OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO DESERVE THE TIME IN THE SPACE TO EXERCISE THEIR CIVIC DUTY. STUDENTS ARE NO EXCEPTION TO THIS CONUNDRUM YOUNG PEOPLE IN FACT HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUTS OF ALL AGE GROUPS. ONLY ONE IN FIVE STUDENTS REPORTED VOTING IN THE TWENTY FOURTEEN MID TERM ELECTIONS. I COULD SHARE WITH YOU A MULTITUDE OF STORIES FROM MY TIME IS VOTE COALITION DIRECTOR IN WHICH DESPERATE AND FRANTIC STUDENTS CAME UP TO ME ON THE DAY OF THE ELECTION LAMENTING THE FACT THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TIME. IN THEIR SCHEDULES TO WAY AT A POLLING STATION TO VOTE. A TYPICAL NARRATIVE COULD BE HAVING A MID TERM ON ELECTION DAY ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEIR CLASSES AS WELL AS A SIX HOUR WORK SHIFT AT LEAST TWO EXTRA CURRICULAR COMMITMENTS ON TOP OF MORE HOMEWORK. COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT THEIR POLLING STATION WAS NOT WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF CAMPUS MEANING THEY HAD NO TIME TO GO OUT AND VOTE. CREATING AN ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY WILL REMOVE A SERIOUS BARRIER FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS WHEN STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT FINDING ENOUGH TIME TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY THEY'RE BOTH MORE APT TO VOTE AND BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THE VOTING PROCESS. EVERYONE DESERVES TO HAVE AMPLE TIME TO VOTE VOTING IS THE BEDROCK OF OUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL WAYS FOR THE ELECTORATE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE LANDSCAPE OF THEIR CITY. THEIR STATE AND THEIR COUNTRY I IMPLORE YOU TO VOTE YES ON EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY SEVEN AND SHOW THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA THAT YOU CARE ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO EXERCISE THEIR CIVIC DUTY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. PROVIDING MORE ACCESS AN OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE IS KEY INCREASING VOTER ENGAGEMENT VOTER TURN OUT. OF INCREASING BETTER ENGAGEMENT IN TURN OUT IS FOSTERING CIVIC PRIDE IN CREATING A CULTURE OF CELEBRATING DEMOCRACY MAKING ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY. SEALS HE RECOGNIZES THAT EXPANDING POWERFUL AN ESSENTIAL WAY TO CHANGE WHAT IS POSSIBLE A POLICY BY ELECTING ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS. WHO AN OFFICE MATTERS BUT WHAT COMES BEFORE THAT IS ENSURING THAT EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE? BECAUSE AMONG THOSE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY DUE TO SCHOOL OR WORK OBLIGATIONS ARE PEOPLE WHOSE VALUES INCLUDE DEFENDING CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND IN ELECTING ENVIRONMENTAL CANDIDATES. AB ONE SEVEN SEVEN NOT ONLY REMOVES ANOTHER BARRIER TO VOTING BUT IT SHOWS THAT CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO EMPHASIZING. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TRADITIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY CURRENTLY EIGHTEEN STATES AND PUERTO RICO MAKE ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY AND IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO JOIN THE STATE'S AND MAKING POLLS MORE ACCESSIBLE. ON ELECTION DAY. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE VERY REAL AND DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND AS WE LOOK TO THE NEXT TWELVE YEARS THAT WE HAVE LEFT. TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESS THIS THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME WE NEED TO UTILIZE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM EVERYONE ON ELECTION DAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND TO HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. PROMISE YES WE HAVE THE CITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRISTIE BELL MY HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF CAL NONPROFIT THE POLICY ALLIANCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT. THANKS. GOOD MORNING CENTER BREYER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES A SUPPOSITION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SONORA ADDITIONAL ESSES IN SUPPORT WITH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. NOT QUITE OPPOSITION -- CONCERNS WINNERS YEAH YES DANIEL SILVINO ASSOCIATION OF REGIONAL CENTER AGENCIES. CALIFORNIA'S TWENTY ONE NONPROFIT REGIONAL CENTRES COORDINATE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES. THOSE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY BY NONPROFITS USUALLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HELP FOLKS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES LIVE WORK PLAY VOTE IN THE COMMUNITY. OUR ISSUE WITH THIS IS THAT IT UNINTENTIONAL INCLUDES A SECTION CALLED THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SECTION SCHEDULE THE TO MULFORD INSTITUTIONS CODE. THOSE ARE HOLIDAYS THEIR FURLOUGH DAYS THAT THE STATE PUT FORWARD IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AS ONE OF ITS BUDGET SOLUTIONS. SO THERE MANDATORY UNPAID DAYS OFF. SO ADDING ELECTION DAY TO THIS LIST IS OTHER FOR LOW DAY HONOR SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE HOPING. I AN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO HAVE THE SECTION REMOVED -- SINCE IT IS ACCIDENTALLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FURLOUGH DAYS HONOR SOCIETY IN OUR COMMUNITY SO -- THAT GLAD THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN CONCERN OR OPPOSITION. SING NUMBER IN BACK TO COLLEAGUES THIS MYTH. THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN IN CALIFORNIA DOES EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA PROVIDE FOR A MALE AND A BALLOT. BECAUSE WHEN I GET THE REASON I ASK IS I GET MY MAIL IN BALLOT AND I HAVE BEEN A PERMANENT ABSENTEE BALLOT. SINCE I WAS SOME FORTY ONE NOW I THINK I WAS IN MY MID TWENTIES -- WHEN I WAS -- WHEN I STARTED BEING A PERMIT MAIL -- BUT THE ABSENTEE VOTER. AND I GET MY ABOUT ALMOST A MONTH -- BEFORE ELECTION DAY. AND SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE IF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO THE POLLS THEY GET THEIR BALLOT BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO TURN IT IN SOME JUST. WONDERING TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO GET A PERMIT ABSENTEE BALLOT AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS IS. NECESSARY IF THAT'S THE CASE. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS ANY VOTER CALIFORNIA CAN REQUEST -- BERMAN ABSENTEE BALLOT. I THOUGHT IT WAS SOME POINT AND AND AND I'LL I'LL SUPPORT THIS FOR NOW BUT I THOUGHT AT SOME POINT EVERYONE WE ABSENTEE BALLOTS. WITH THE REQUESTED OR NOT. THIS ORDER CENTER. SO IN KING COUNTY IS A MOVE TO VOTERS CHOICE ACT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT MODEL EVERY COUNTY EVERY VOTER IN THOSE COUNTIES GET THE ABSENTEE BALLOT NOT EVERY COUNTY GUYS DON'T HAVE TO MOVE TO THAT MODEL. IT'S IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO ARE THE COUNTIES MOVING TO THE MODEL OF THE VOTING CENTERS THE ALLY. YEAH BUT I THOUGHT WHICH IS GIVE THEM. MANY DAYS A HIT TO VOTE YES THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY THING I THOUGHT AND I'LL I'LL. NOT SUPPORT IS NOW BUT I THINK ITH THE KIND OF CHANGES WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST -- I DON'T THREE TWO THREE YEARS ALMOST MAKES THIS SOMEWHAT UNNECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE -- THE VOTING CENTERS THAT ARE OPEN IN DIFFERENT PLACES IN LIBRARIES AND ALL KINDS OF PLACES THE PEOPLE CAN BEGIN TO VOTE EARLY -- WE OF EARLY VOTING WE HAVE A BALLOT THE CENTERS WE CAN DROP THE BALLOT OFF AT THE LIBRARY THIS THIS THIS SO. YOU KNOW I AND AND SO I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S IT'S NECESSARY AT THIS POINT -- TO THEN HAVE A HOLIDAY THAT ON THAT DAY BECAUSE IF. WHERE THE HOPE IS THAT MOST FOLKS WILL OF VOTED BEFORE THAT DAY BUT ALSO THAT THERE WILL BE ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WITH ITS SUNDAY OR MONDAY OR SATURDAY WHEN PEOPLE GO TO THE VOTING CENTER SELF? AND I KNOW MOST COUNTIES IN MOVING TOWARD IT IT IN SAN DIEGO EVERYBODY GETS AN ABSENT ABSENTEE BALLOT THEY CAN USE THAT OR NOT BUT THEY GET. ONE AND SOUL -- SO I DON'T EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS AND THIS ISN'T AN EXPENSE OUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO HAVE ALL THESE HOLIDAYS PAID FOR THE AT THE STATE LEVEL. ALL IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER THINGS WE'VE DONE SO I THINK THAT MAYBE I SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT OF BECAUSE WE'VE DONE A LOT ALREADY. TO OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT USED TO BE ONE DAY AND ONE DAY ONLY YOU KNOW IT'S ALMOST A MONTH I THINK THAT THIS ONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE. ACCESS TO THOSE GROUPS NEW VOTING CENTERS THAT ARE COMMON TO PLACE BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR IT EARLIER BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S STILL STAYS THERE TODAY. AS ONE TO FOLLOW UP WITH I'M NOT SURE THAT I WAS CLEAR -- TO THE VOTE THE VOTE CENTERS THAT YOU REFERENCED SO SOME SOME COUNTIES ARE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION -- IT IT WE HOPE THAT ALL DO BUT IT'S UP TO THE COUNTIES THE VOTE CENTER SLASH VOTERS CHOICE MODEL -- IS VOLUNTARY FOR FOR COUNTIES TO ADOPT THAT MODEL. BUT FIVE OF THEM DID IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND AND MORE ADOPTING AND NOW [inaudible] ANY ADDITIONAL [inaudible] MS ROGER. YES SO -- YOU KNOW ONE I WOULD JUST I WOULD CONCUR WITH THE REMARKS OF MY COLLEAGUE -- AS A MEMBER WEBER IT IS YOU KNOW AS AS WE AS WE ARE MOVING MORE MORE TOWARDS ABSENTEE VOTING AND N. B. B. M.'S AND HAVING VOTE CENTERS -- WHERE VOTING OCCURS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME -- YOU KNOW IT SEEMS LESS AND LESS NECESSARY TO HAVE YOU KNOW ONE DAY THAT STILL TOTALLY DEVOTED ONLY. ONLY TO TO VOTING SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. TO CONSIDER I JUST I THINK IT IF. IT MAKES KIND OF THE BILL I THINK UNNECESSARY -- AT THIS TIME -- BUT JUST BE. MIGHT BE A NECESSARY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A HEARING TODAY. AND YOU KNOW AND I AND I KNOW YOU TO BE A VERY THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATOR AND I KNOW YOU WOULD BRING UP A BILL -- AND AND AND SUBMIT IT. HELLO UNLESS YOU BELIEVED IN IT VERY STRONGLY AND I KNOW YOU DO AND SO AND AND I'VE BEEN I'M DEFINITELY YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM YOU WHY YOU THINK. IT IS NECESSARY -- BUT YOU KNOW I GUESS THE OTHER PART I WOULD I WOULD GET AT IS YOU KNOW WE OFTEN GO TO THAT TWENTY FOURTEEN CYCLE INSIDE THE VERY LOW TURN OUT. I'M SURPRISED WE'RE NOT HEARING MORE ABOUT THIS LAST MID TERM. RIGHT WHERE ACTUALLY -- IT WAS THE HIGHEST VOTING TURN OUT. I THINK SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- SIXTY FOUR POINT 5% VOTER TURN OUT -- AND ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. WAS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN EVER I WAS ACTUALLY ON THE CHEEK A STATE CAMPUS ON ELECTION DAY -- AND YOU KNOW STUDENTS WERE LINED UP OUT THE DOOR VOTING -- ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS A STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY AS AS YOU WERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING -- I CAME AND TESTIFIED OF BELIEVE BEFORE TRYING. TO MAKE REGISTRATIONS AVAILABLE. ON CAMPUS YOU KNOW SLIPPERY SLOPE BE KAREN. AND YOU KNOW. BUT BUT THE REALITY IS I MEAN I WENT TO UC BERKELEY I REGISTERED TO VOTE IN BERKELEY -- VOTE IN EVERY ELECTION NEVER HAD A PROBLEM VOTING AND AND GOING TO THE POLLS. AND AND ENSURING THAT MY VOTE WAS CAST AND NOW WE HAVE REGISTRATIONS ON CAMPUS YOU CAN AGAIN YOU CAN VOTE -- THROUGHOUT ALMOST A MONTH AHEAD OF TIME ESPECIALLY FOR AN ABSENTEE VOTER YOU CAN. YOU KNOW PUT THAT VOTE IN A TENT SO I JUST. IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE GOT A HAT WE GIVE PEOPLE TO TWO HOURS OFF OF WORK -- YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT -- SO I MEAN I THINK IT'S JUST HARDER AND HARDER TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT. YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY VOTE -- WITHOUT SO I THINK YOU THINGS IN MIND I WOULD JUST DEFINITELY. ENTERTAIN ANY ANY REBUTTALS THAT YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE TO THOSE -- TO THOSE TWO POINTS THANK YOU THANK YOU I THINK MR MAY IS THAT IN ANOTHER POINT YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO TO SAY -- OF WELL I HAVE GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR. A CAN'T SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- I WOULD BE SUPPORTING IT IF WE WERE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A MAIL IN. A PROGRAM -- AND WE ARE ALL EVERYBODY VOTED ON ELECTION DAY I WOULD ACTUALLY. BE THE ASKING FOR A STATE HOLIDAY FOR ALL WORKERS I'M ON THAT ON THAT DAY ABOUT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE -- WE CREATED ALL SORTS OF WAYS AND THAT FOR FOLKS TO VOTE I'M SO TODAY I'M I JUST CAN'T BE SUPPORTIVE OF OF THIS -- THANK YOU. ANY CLOSING REMARKS. YES SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR THE FOR THE CONVERSATION -- PART OF THE ISSUE IS. HOW DO WE IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO LOWER BARRIERS TO ENTRY SO WHILE THIS? IN IN ISOLATION A WOMAN TO BE THE SILVER BULLET WE ARE HEADED IN THE DIRECTION TO MAKE VOTING THAT MUCH EASIER AS YOU SEEN WITH ALL THE TRAJECTORY OF PREPAID POSTAGE OF APPS THE BALLOT AUTOMATED VOTER REGISTRATION. SO THESE ARE THIS IS JUST ONE ADDITIONAL SCHOOL TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR GREATER DEMOCRACY GREATER PARTICIPATION SO IN ISOLATION YES I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT OKAY YES WE DO ALREADY HAVE MANY THINGS. TO ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS TO PARTICIPATE BUT THIS IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL -- ARROW IN THE QUIVER TO ALLOW FOR I ALSO WANT TO MAKE MENTION ABOUT. THE NOTION OF OTHER HOLIDAYS THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE SO WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF AND OKAY DAY AND WHAT HOW WAS THAT RECOGNIZED TODAY WELL WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECALL HISTORY. AND OKAY DAY OF SERVICE ALEXIAN DAY HOLIDAY TALKS AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IN DUTY TO HAVE A SAY WHY DO WE HAVE A WHOLE THAT IS NOT JUST TO JUST TAKE A DAY OFF. BUT WHAT IS DEMOCRACY ABOUT WHAT IS YOUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY WHAT YOUR OBLIGATION TO OUR SOCIETY TO PARTICIPATE TO GET OUT IN THE POLLS. TO HELP WITH ELECTIONS AND WHAT IS AN ELECTION AND THESE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT WE NEED MON TO INSTITUTIONALIZE SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE. BENEFITS TO AN ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY THERE'S NOT JUST SIMPLY ABOUT. GOING TO THE ACTUAL POLLS BUT ALSO HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS OUR MORE OBLIGATION AS ACTIVE CITIZENS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THERE ASSOCIATED IMPACTS WITH. RECOGNIZING AN ACTUAL HOLIDAY SO AGAIN THIS IS JUST AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT TO INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION BUT ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DUTIES AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK THROUGHOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR Là. SO I SUPPORTED TWO IDENTICAL BILLS BY -- THIS AUTHOR LAST SESSION AND I WANT TO COME AND COMMEND HIM ON HIS COMMITMENT. TO TAKING STEPS TO MAKE OUR ELECTIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO VOTERS. THE STATE IS ALREADY TAKEN A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT STEPS AS WE'VE HEARD FROM TODAY -- AND ADOPTING -- THIS BILL PASSING THIS BILL WILL SIMILARLY SEEK TO ENSURE THAT WORK AND SCHOOL CONFLICTS ARE NOT BARRIERS. TO VOTER PARTICIPATION AND SO ON HAVE WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY WILL YOU PLEASE STOP MOTION. OKAY AND WE STILL NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. I'VE GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND. I'M SORRY PLEASE HOLD ROLE.

MAYES I MODE. WHEN I WEBER [inaudible] MEMBER I THAT IS THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS OUT ON A SEVEN TWO ZERO VOTE AND MISTER ICE YOUR IF YOU LIKE. TO GO AHEAD OF THE POSITION. SURE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- HONORED TO PRESENT AB THREE TWENTY TWO TODAY AT A AND COMMITTEE -- A BILL I THINK IT'S VERY NECESSARY -- AND A GOOD ADDITION TO TRANSPARENCY -- IN OUR OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS. YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW. FOR ALL OF US IS CANDIDATES WHO WHO HAVE RUN FOR STATE OFFICE -- ANYBODY CAN GO ONLINE THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE. AND SEE WHO HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CAMPAIGNS AND AS WE GET INTO THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR REPORTING PERIOD THEY CAN SEE IMMEDIATELY. YOU KNOW WHAT -- CONTRIBUTIONS ARE MADE IS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION. AND I THINK FOR THE PUBLIC THEY FIND THAT VERY USEFUL. TO SEE HEY WHO IS WHO IS CONTRIBUTING WHAT WHAT INTERESTS MIGHT BE CONTRIBUTING TO VARIOUS CAMPAIGNS AND INITIATIVES -- BUT AS AS WE KNOW IS THAT DOES NOT APPLY -- TO MANY CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT DON'T POST -- THEIR CAMPAIGN FINANCE INFORMATION ONLINE AND THIS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- MUST FIND THE RIGHT GOVERNMENT BUILDING IN EACH JURISDICTION -- GO THERE IN PERSON MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY DURING NORMAL FIGURE OUT WHO IS WHO IS. NEIL GET COPIES OF THE ACTUAL FORM -- FOR SIXTY AND YOU KNOW BOB SHOULD I THINK IT ALSO BURNS A LOT OF COUNTY TIME. YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE HAVE TO FIND THOSE DOCTORS BRING ABOUT MAKE COPIES. SO I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER YOU KNOW IN TODAY'S DIGITAL AGE WITH TECHNOLOGY -- IT SHOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TIME OR EFFORT -- TO EITHER TO SCAN AND POST THESE ONLINE -- OR UTILIZE SOFTWARE THAT WOULD YOU KNOW PROVIDE THE SAME THING THAT WE HAVE ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE -- AND SO MANY MANY LOCAL IN THIS -- BUT YOU KNOW THIS AB THREE TWENTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE THAT ALL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS POST ONLINE IN SOME FORMAT -- THE FOUR SIXTY FORM SO THAT EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND AND AND EASILY ACCESS THAT INFORMATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL. AND I DO HAVE A HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY JOE PATTERSON -- THE MAYOR OF A NEARBY ROCKLAND. AND ALSO DANIEL NEWMAN -- FROM MAP PLAYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S JOE PATTERSON I'M THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF ROCKLIN -- NEARBY WELCOME YOU ANY TIME. PRIOR TO ME BEING ELECTED THE CITY COUNCIL IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN I WILL I WANT TO CITY HALL AND ATTEMPTED TO I HAD ACTUALLY WALK INTO CITY HALL TO LOOK AT THE FORMS AND I HAD TO ASK FOR THE BINDER -- IS A VERY AWKWARD SITUATION BECAUSE I AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T HAVE ANY SUPPORT OUR FANS IN THE CITY -- ONE NOW I'M HAPPY TO BE MAYOR AND SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED THE CITY COUNCIL ONE OF MY THINGS HAS BEEN INCREASING TRANSPARENCY IN THE CITY. AND SO EVEN THOUGH SOME WOMEN GALLAGHER IS NOT OUR ASSEMBLY MAN I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL TO BRING TO OUR CITY SO WE'VE SUPPORTED IT AS A CITY COUNCIL. AND WE DID ASK OUR CLERK BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXACTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS BILL YET BUT WE DID ASK OUR CITY CLERK ONE WE WERE. HAVING A DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL WHAT'S THE BURDEN TO DO THIS. A SIMPLE HIRED A SCANNED THE FORMS SENATOR REID TAKE AS PRIDE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES SO -- SO WITH THAT IT'S HARD ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS AND WE WILL IMPLEMENT THIS IN ROCKLIN. EITHER WAY BUT I THINK EVERY JURISTIC THANK YOU THEY MISTER MAYOR RICHARD. HOWEVER MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANIEL NEWMAN I'M THE CO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF MAP LATE. WHICH IS THAT CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ADD THAT THAT WE ADVANCE GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND I'M TESTIFYING IN FAVOR OF THIS BILL AB THREE TWENTY TWO AND IT WOULD HELP USHER IN AN ERA OF GREATER TRANSPARENCY. FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT MUCH BURDEN AT LOCAL CAMPAIGN FIND REPORTS OUTLINED. WHO IS CONTRIBUTING TO LOCAL CAMPAIGNS AND HOW THAT MONEY IS SPENT? AND CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES THAT LOCAL AGENCIES MAKE THESE REPORTS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BUT MOST GOVERNMENTS FORCE PEOPLE TO REVIEW THE REPORTS IN PERSON AT A GOVERNMENT BUILDING TO THROUGH IT IN THE CASE THAT THE MAYOR SAID. RATHER THAN PUTTING THE INFORMATION ONLINE WORK ME ACCESS MORE EASILY AT TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT FROM THE NONPROFIT GROUP COMMON CAUSE FOUND THAT 70%. OF CALIFORNIA CITIES REQUIRE AN IN PERSON VISIT TO THE CITY CLERK ANOTHER GOVERNMENT OFFICE THE MOST CITIES DON'T HAVE THEIR INFORMATION ONLINE CRITIQUE THAT REPORT. L. CROSSES STATE OF COURSE CALIFORNIANS ALREADY USE THE INTERNET TO REGISTER TO VOTE TO DEPOSIT CHECKS TO STAY UPDATED ON THE NEWS PRETTY MUCH FOR EVERYTHING. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESSING INFORMATION ABOUT WHO IS FINDING THEIR LECTIN OFFICIALS IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE ARE DENIED REASONABLE ACCESS TO THIS UNLESS YOU CAN GET YOURSELF TO A GOVERNMENT OFFICE DURING BUSINESS HOURS WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE THAT WORK WILL HAVE LIMITED TRANSPORTATION. AND AS A MAYOR NOTED IT'S NOW TRULY EASEL TRIVIALLY EASY TO POST A DOCUMENT ONLINE YOU JUST SCAN IT AND POST IT. AND SO MAKING THE STRANGE CHANGE WILL BE STRAIGHT FORWARD FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IT'LL HELP -- NOT ONLY WILL IT HELP MAKE VOTERS TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS TO BE MORE ACTIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES BUT IT'S ALSO AN EASY WAY TO INCREASE PUBLIC TRUST IN GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS. BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY DOES CONTRIBUTE TO TRY PLEASE TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT BILL AB. THREE TWENTY TWO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OUR MOTION.
