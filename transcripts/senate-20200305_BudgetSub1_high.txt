DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER HAVE YOU AS YOUR OFFICE LOOKED AT WHAT THE RIGHT NUMBER WOULD BE OR HOW MUCH MORE MONEY WE SHOULD BE SPENDING. ON OUR STUDENTS TO GET US TO WHERE WE NEED. NOT THIRTY NINTH. I'M THE MOST THE MOST. REPORTER FROM GETTING DOWN THE FAX TO PUTS THE NUMBER IN THE BILLIONS OKAY AT IT IN ORDER FOR US TO- COMPARED TO WHAT IT BUT WHAT A STATE LIKE NEW YORK MAKES IN ITS ALLOCATE TEN. WOULD MEAN LITERALLY AN INCREASE. OF I THINK THEY ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE WAY WE REVENUE TO THE STATE WE CAN'T DO THAT WITH CURRENT REVENUE METRICS THAT HAVE. THE NEW. TO GENERATE MORE REVENUE BUT THE NUMBERS IN THE BILLIONS THAT WE DO A NUMBER YOU HEARING BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY. ANY IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE FINE I JUST IS THE CHAIR OF EDUCATION I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS OUR NUMBER WE TRYING TO GET TO HELP AND THEN WE CAN MAYBE CREATE A PATH THAT THERE SO YEAH. CAN BE. MADE IT TOMORROW. WEAKER THE FOR COUPLE WEEKS THAT'S FINE THANK YOU IT WILL IT WILL GET YOUR NUMBER IN AYE AYE AYE SOME AS PUT IN INCOME TAX BY THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE SPENT ON IT. IN LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT THE CASE FROM. CASE TWELVE EIGHT AND THEN READY. YOU'RE PROBABLY WRAPPED IN A- CASE PIRATE. PERCENT BLESS YOUR STATE EVEN WITH PASSING PERSON WE STILL UNABLE TO GET PAST BEING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY NINETEEN FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT WE HAVE HAD IN THAT WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE CALIFORNIA CANNOT SUSTAIN BILLIONS MORE WITHOUT CREATING NEW REVENUE STREAM. YOU HAVE A WORK CREATED THIS SONG CREATING. ANY FOR THE STATE WE LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MADAM CHAIR IN IN IN THE CAPACITY AS CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE- AND THIS COMMITTEE ON LIKE YOU SAY CREATING THAT PATHWAY TO GENERATING REVENUE TO. WHICH NUMBER ONE FARK IT. THIS WAS NOT MISTER SUPERINTENDENT IGNORE WE JUST ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS- AGAIN AND- NOT TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT IN LOOKING AT THE THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP. BECAUSE THE THIS MAY BE OUT OF YEARS OUT OF YOUR SANDBOX IN IN THE SENSE THAT IT'S NOT YOUR STATISTIC AND IT'S NOT YOUR REPORT BUT IN LOOKING AT. LA THOSE- REPORT- PROP NINETY EIGHT TEN OTHER EDUCATION ISSUES. THAT WAS ISSUED ON FEBRUARY. THERE IS A STATISTIC IN HERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ASK KELLY- ABOUT IT WHEN I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN A COUPLE MINUTES. THAT REFLECTS A WEEK AT TWO HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND F. T. E. TEACHERS. OR WE HAD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN- AND PRESUMABLY WE MAY HAVE MORE OR LESS BUT- IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE BALLPARK. AND ABOUT TWENTY SIX THOUSAND FTP PRINCIPALS AND OTHER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS IN THE STATE. SO TO NINETY FIVE VERSES TWENTY SIX. IF THAT WHEN WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OTHER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE AND AGAIN IT'S NOT YOUR RECORD BUT IF THAT STATISTIC HAS ANY VALIDITY THAN WE IT APPEARS WE HAVE A RATIO OF. ONE PRINCIPLE OR SCHOOL ADMINISTRA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR TO. ELEVEN F. T. E. TEACHERS. WHICH IS A BETTER RATIO THAN WE HAVE STUDENT A TEACHER IN THE STATE. ANY IS THAT AN ANALYSIS OR IS THERE ANY SIMILAR ANALYSIS THAT GOES ON WITHIN YOU WERE. A DEPARTMENT AS TO WHETHER WE HAVE THE RIGHT NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATORS VERSUS FOLKS IN THE CLASS ROOM. CENTER FOR QUESTION AT JUST THAT WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME THINKING ABOUT HOW SUPPORT DECATUR'S FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS DR GREX IS GOING TO TOUCH ON. THE RATIO BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE BUDGET CALLS FOR AROUND TRAINING. IT SPLITS THE TRAINING FOR PERFECT ELEMENT FORTY. AS FOR ADMINISTRATORS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE RESEARCH ABOUT WILL NEED TO DO TO CLOSE. THE GAP IT TALKS ABOUT WE NEED TO SUPPORT AB ONE ARMY. AND NOT. RIGHT AND HAVING I JUST AND MANY PART OF THE ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW DRIVE MY MONEY AND THE CLASS. YOU KNOW STUDENT SPENDING HOW MUCH MONEY ACTUALLY FINDS ITS WAY INTO THE CLASSROOM AND WHETHER THERE. ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE IT JUST CONSIDER AND I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I WHICH IS. IT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. TODAY AND I THOUGHT I'D AT. I WOULDN'T TO ADD ON WHAT ARE SUPER SPOKE ABOUT YOU AS A FORMER PRINCIPAL I HAD A SCHOOL SITE OF ABOUT SIXTY TEACHERS AND I HAD AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I OVER A HUNDRED STUDENTS SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL FIRE. AND DISTRICT AND THE NEED TO BE SIDE SCHOOL HOW. IRV DATE IT'S REALLY HOW MUCH IS THE RACE BETWEEN OUR STUDENTS AND OUR- AND THEY ALSO DISTRICT ADMINISTRATION SO THERE'S DIFFERENT LAYERS. OF ADMINISTRATORS WITHIN THE SCHOOL IN A COUNTY LEVEL TO REALLY HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. TO DETERMINE WHAT IS BEST RATIO BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD. PINPOINT IT WHEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CONTEXT AND DEMOGRAPHICS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITH OUR BEST. HAVE IT THE STATE ON THAT IT TO BENCHMARK WHAT. RELY IT'S NOT A- FIXED. RATE PRESUMABLY ANY OTHER ENTERPRISE YOU HAVE MANAGER SUPERVISORS IN THOSE TWO ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE SUPERVISION AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY. DO THE WORK IN. AND THE WORKERS ARE CERTAINLY VALUABLE IN THE PROCESS AND- UNDOUBTEDLY NEED TO BE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME OVER SEND SOME TO PROVISION BUT IN THE EDUCATIONAL. ANY STUDY IN A COMPETENT THE RIVER DONE. WHAT ARE IN PERHAPS BUT THEY SHOULD BE IN EVERY. I DON'T. THINK ABOUT THE RATE. PRINCE PERSIST SURE OR DISTRICT DIMINISH. AS A WHOLE I DO KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF STUDIES AROUND PRINCIPLE ACTIVE WITH AND WHY. THEY MEAN TO BE IN A PRINCIPLE. THAT THEY ARE PUTTING. BUT IS THIS. MANY CPAS STUDY AGAIN I'M NOT BE CRITICAL JUST WANNA A AS THE I THOUGHT IT WAS SORT OF AN INTERESTING- DATA POINT. DEPENDING ON HOW WE DEFINE SOME OF THOSE TERMS IS THAT YOUR WILL LOOK DEEPER INTO THAT AND PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION. OUTSIDE OF THIS HEARING THAT I WILL IS WE'RE TALKING. I'M MY WIT'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WHERE THERE ARE AN ASSISTANT PRINCIPALS. AND NOT THE FEEDBACK THAT I OFF. FROM THE PRINCIPAL AND FROM THE PRINCIPAL STAFF IS THAT THE PRINCIPAL JUST PULLED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THAT THERE OFTEN IS NOT SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE TEACHERS AND TO THE STAFF ON CAMPUS WHEN THERE'S AN EMERGENCY. WHEN THERE'S ANY FEW AND IT WAS A PRETTY AWAY FOR IN THE THING WE WANT. THE INSTRUCTION PETER WAS COACHING IS PUTTING. AND I'M WE'RE CERTAINLY INTEREST IN WHAT UP REPORTS LIFTING UP WILL LOOK IN IT I SUSPECT THAT THE- IS ON THIS CAMPUS YEAH. I SUSPECT THE ISSUE IS OF THE SCHOOL CAMPUS YES SIR AND THE QUESTION IS WILL DOING WHAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE DOING WHO ARE. JUST ABOVE THE SCHOOL. SURE HELLO. AND THAT IS THE YOU ADDED I ISIS WHEN WE DIG YOU DIG AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND. OUT I'M SHE THAT THIS PURPOSES LEAN AND MEAN DOWN THERE. DID ME TO SUGGEST THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT. IS LEVELS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM ABOVE THE SCHOOL CAMPUS HERE IT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU DO LOOK INTO IT I WOULD ASK THAT YOU LOOK INTO THAT AS WELL JUST TO SEE BECAUSE IT ALL COMES OUT OF THE- QUE. EDUCATION YES YEAH THE STATE SURE THAT WE GET THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK AND DRIVE THE MOST A DOWN IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY BEING EDUCATED NOW THAT'S NOT TO SAY. THE FOLKS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND CURRICULA OAKS PROVIDE ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO HOW TO TEACH AFFECTED IN ALL THAT ARE NOT EXTRA NEARLY VALUE. SYSTEM I. IF WE HAVEN'T TAKEN. WE WERE. AS A DISTRAUGHT I'M AND WE'RE BUSINESS DAY JUST BECAUSE WE DID IT THAT WAY SIXTY YEARS AGO MAYBE WE GOT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT. I'M A STILL A VALID WHICH WE COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF HOW WE DELIVER EDUCATION IN THE STATE WITH THE BLACK EVERYTHING IS PROVOKING YOU YOU ARE RIGHT. FOR IN. USE FORCE. IN SO QUESTION THIS IS WELL TIMED WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT EVERY SINGLE WAY IN SYSTEM IS ENGAGING HELP DELIVERY CATION CALIFORNIA WE GOT THE RIGHT TEAM THE PLACE OVER HAPPENED IN HIS CASE ABOUT IT ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE- BUDGET. RELIES TO GO NOT SURE BY. BUT THERE MONEY THERE'S MY OF WAITED OPPOSED BE APPROPRIATED FOR THINGS LIKE OPPORTUNITY GRANTS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ISN'T ONE TIME MONEY AND IN SPECIAL EDUCATION- NOT TO SUGGEST THAT THAT MONEY THAT THOSE ISSUES ARE NOT- EXTRA UNDER IMPORTANT AND THAT THE DO NOT DOES. MONEY DID AT THEM. LOUIS LET ME BACK UP ONE OF THE CRITICISMS FOR THE SUGGESTIONS IS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF. SPECIFIC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ATTACHED TO EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND GIVEN THAT YOU ACTUALLY GET ANYTHING OF VALUE OR OF ANY SIGNIFICANT VALUE OUT OF A ONE TIME EXPENDITURES TO HOW HOW DO WE ATTACH. GOALS OBJECTIVES MILESTONES TO THESE TO THIS ONE TIME FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE CAN EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXPENDITURE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. WHEN THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE ABOUT A BUCKET OF MONEY THAT WE THINK IS GOING TO BE THERE. BEYOND THE YEAR. WE KNOW. WHEN WE PICK UP A HANDFUL OF IT WHERE TO PUT IT IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION AND MR CUEVAS IS- READY TO TALK SOME WORK THAT WEIRD PARTMINER FINANCE ALLOW HOUSE OF THOSE PLANS WILL WORK- HEY THIS SAID. THE GOVERNOR LAID OUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS LIKE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM. HE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO DOZEN DISTRICTS THAT EXISTS IN THE STATE WERE KIDS LIVE IN THE HIGHEST RATES OF POVERTY. DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO POTENTIAL TEACHERS- THERE'S RITUAL SEGREGATE AND IT IS NO. ACCIDENT THOSE ARE THE DISTRICT HAVE I ALSO WISH TO WRAP. OUR CHEAP MAKE. AND SO- WHAT WE'RE DOING TO WORKING WITH. KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT GRANT PROGRAM BE SET UP WE CAN MOVE THOSE RESOURCES THE DISH QUICKLY OUT WE HAVE WAYS FOR THERE TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES BUILT IN FOR REPORTING. ON THE IMPACTS OF THAT WORK SO IT WAS TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT THERE'S MONEY AVAILABLE. YOU HAVE A EXIST STRUCTURE. THE FINAL THE DOWN TO THE PLACE THAT. CAN MAY THE MOST IMPACT I DON'T KNOW THE GOVERNOR OUR OFFICES MADE ANY KIND OF STATEMENTS THAT BECAUSE THESE ARE FUN THIS TIME THEY'RE GONNA BE FUNDED YOU YEAR. FOR NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON. DOLLARS SPENT WILL NOW AND THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE DOLLARS. AND REPORTS ON THE END. ON THAT THEY HAVE. ON PROVEN EXPERIENCE ARRESTED. WILL COMMUNITIES GO FOR IS A IS A DAY PERFECT EXAMPLE AS I REMEMBER. AND I'M NOT. CERTAINLY NO THE EDUCATION BURDEN THIS FOR. THERE ARE STE IS IT THAT A THAT THE SCHOOLS AT LEE HAS AN IMPACT IN THOSE AREAS WHERE IT IS ON THE GROUND IN I RIGHT YES YOU WANT TO ADD TO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SIR THAT YOU. WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH OUR- OUR COLLEAGUE FIELD ABOUT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE. WHICH WHEN TAKEN COMMITTEE SCHOOLS AND SO LEAN ON V. THE FOLKS ARE UP ON THE FIELD GIVING US SOME REAL TIME FEEDBACK AS TO YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEEDED IN TWENTY TWO MOVING FORWARD. AND SO I ALREADY HAVE. CONVERSELY MEANS WORKING VERY CLOSE WITH THE IT. THE WHEN A FINANCED THROUGH THE TRAILER. PROCESS SORT OF THAT. MORE OF THESE MORE THE- ISSUE THAT YOU JUST RACER I. HOW DO WE- AFFECT AND IF IT LONG STATE AS SUPERINTENDENT THERE IS NO PROPER SET THE MONEY'S BE THERE. A YEARS OUT OUR HOPE ABILITY STRUCTURE PLAY NOW. YOUR WHEN THE TIME COMES WILL CAN. THE ISSUE A AND OPPORTUNITY TO AND MORE FUNDING FOR IT WE HAVE IT SOME OF STAKE IN GROUND. THAT SHOWS THAT THE PER WORK THAT THE FUNDS THAT WERE INVESTED. WERE WISELY STE AND MAKING THE FOR INVESTMENT IF OPPORTUNITY ARISES. IF NOTHING ELSE AT LEAST WE AT LEAST HELPED OUR COMMUNITIES OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. BUILD OUT A CANISTER SURE THAT THE USE MOVED OVER. ARE PRESIDENT EDUCATE THERE'S ALONG THE WAY. I WILL. TO MORE THOUGHT OR DO THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE ADDITION SAW. TO HOW WE STRUCK. OF THIS OF. AND I NEED TO GO THE BETWEEN WHAT IT IS IT'S ABOUT BILLION BILLION TO. OF ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS AND VERY OTHER. ACT THESE GIVE. STRESSOR THAT ARE EXISTING CASE THROUGH. TWELVE AT TODAY A AND- I SURE. SIX THIS ARE. A WE YOU TURN GOING TO BE UNDER PRESSURE HERE AS WE CONSIDER THE BUDGET AND WE MAKE DECISIONS AND TRIAGE WHAT WE DO. TO DIRECT THIS MONEY FOR THIS MONEY. TO A LONGER RANGE PROGRAM EXTENDING OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO BUY. FINANCIAL RELIEF TO DISTRICTS WHETHER IT'S IN THE FORM OF. PENSION BY DOWN PENSION OBLIGATION BY DOWNS OR SPECIAL EDUCATION. FUNDING OR OTHER AREAS WHERE. THE DISTRICTS ARE UNDER PRESSURE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR GENERAL FUND AND SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THESE ONE TIME PRO. GRAMS THAT SET UP SORT OF ON A ONE TIME BASED. RIGHT I. OTHER THEN YOU KNOW THOSE FUNDED SO I'LL FORWARD TO WORK WITH YOU ALL ON THIS ISSUE AS WE MOVE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. AND DEAL WITH THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE UNDOUBTEDLY GOING TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE TO HAVE A SAY IN. IN THIS PROCESS SO. ASSEMBLY I JUST WANT TO PUBLICLY REGISTER MY SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS I THINK WE ASK SO MUCH MORE OF OUR SCHOOLS OF OUR TEACHERS IF WE CAN CREATE THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH AT THE SCHOOLS I THINK IT BY THE BED WITH A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF KNOW NOT HAVING TO BE THE MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER. KIDS ARE DISCO PUNK. AND THAT ALL JUST. OUR AND FOR. JUST ONE REGISTER MY SUPPORT AND SAY IN WAY THAT I CAN BE. ON A YOU WANNA COME ON TO THE I WE SET SOME UP THERE HAPPY TO WITH THAT BUT I THINK MIGHT BE NEW IF THINKING OF OUR SCHOOL I'M SO USED A LOT FROM WHEN I. FOR TWENTY. IS A FORWARD. THANK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN WAS MAKING THE POINT THAT THE- SCHOOLS. ACTUALLY HAVE. THERE'S RESEARCH. THAT PROVEN THAT IT ACTUALLY. AND ACT. BEFORE SENSE OF WE'RE- YOUR STATE AND THEN YOU. LEADERSHIP HERE WE WILL. WE HONEST. THAT THE CONVERSE. ABOUT OF THE ONCE I INVESTMENTS HAVE TO. BE THE LARGER. CON ALL THE THINGS THAT ISSUE. PENSION PENSION ON THE- AMONG THE THAT WE HAVE TAKEN WE DO HAVE A WE HAVE CREATE ALL A THAT IS FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF PENSION HAVE WITH THIS FOR ABOUT THEY CAN ADDRESS SPENT NOT BE GAVE AND CONNECT TO IT MIGHT IN THE STATE FOR DOING. FOR TO STAY INTO FOR THE ABOUT THAT. TO BE CLEAR YOU UNDERSTAND CONCERN IS NOT WITH THE VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM BUILT A ONE TIME NATURE THE FIRST SO IF WE DID AS A- AS A SENATOR PERCENT. HEAVEN FORBID WE THE OTHER IS A LEGISLATURE A- WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS OF TENER EVER MANY THERE ARE HAVE MORE THAN OTHER NOT TO ANY OF THE- NO OUR VALUE WHAT'S TO SAY INSTEAD OF THREE HUNDRED AS A ONE TIME. FUNDING ITEM WE DON'T DO NINE HUNDRED BILLION THEN ON GO FUNDING OR WHATEVER TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM BUT HARD TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY SCHOOL ONE TIME. THIS NO NO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT NEXT YEAR SO. YOU CAN HARPER BECAUSE AT CREE AN IS. YOU CAN'T BUILD SO BECAUSE THAT CREE AN AGE. SO YOU'RE SETTLING AS TO WHAT YOU DO YOU'RE LIMITED IT SEEMS TO ME THE STAFF YOU HAVE IN THE ASSET YOU HAVE AND TRY TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BETTER AND MAYBE THAT'S THE SOLUTION BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THE COVERAGE SAID. CAN I LOOK FORWARD. AT MY PER. TO HELLO. WE LIVE WHERE YOU AND I CAN AND I THIS CAN ARE GRAY PLACE TO DO IT THANK FOR YOUR- CONSIDER GUESS THAT. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US. FELLOW NUMBER TWO. YOU KNOW YOU ARE. YEAH. I COULD ASK YOU ALL TO IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD- LET'S SEE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER. PARTICIPANTS ARE EVER GOING TO HAVE YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT. MA'AM THAT YOU. BUT BUT THEY YOU AGAIN I AM CHRISTIAN RIGHT THIS EDUCATION. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING LISA RESIDENTS GIVE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. A GROUP BROUGHT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. CAN COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YEAH MAY NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS THEY HAVE EXPERTS IN FRONT OF ME OKAY WHO WANTS TO START. I'LL START AGAIN WE CAN PRESENT YOU WITH APARTMENT A FINANCESO YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A ONE PAGE HANDOUT. ALL THAT HAND OUT OF THE FIRST FIGURE IS JUST A- OVERVIEW OR SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE OVER THE THREE YEAR BUDGET WINDOW- AND THEN YOU'RE TO LAYS OUT THE GOVERNORS OF FOR THE TWENTY. FIRST YOU TO LAYS OUT A- THIS SPINACH TO INCLUDE IN THE NURSE FOR A PROPOSAL FOR K. TWELVE ON THE BACK YOU'LL SEE A DETAILED LIST OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SENATORS INCLUDING AND THIS WAS ALL THIRD TO BEGIN WITH BUDGET AGAIN IS THAT WITH THE OF ANY. EARLY STRONG A ON AS REFLECTED IN FIGURE ON OVER THREE EUROPEAN WERE UP THAT BOTH REVENUES AND TAXES SEE A SIZEABLE IN. AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN SEEN AND THEY'RE OUT PERFORM THIS. AND ANOTHER ON PROP NINETY FIVE TO CUT NOTE IS AGAIN AVERAGE TEN IN A ROW. WORK CONTINUING TO SEE AT THE IN THE AREAS. AND THIS IS REALLY TO MAJOR FOR ONE NECK NECK MY GRAY OUT OF STATE OF ALSO OUR BIRTH RATES. IN HAVE BEEN DROPPING. SO AS A RESULT OF THOSE THREE FACTORS YOU'LL SEE THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD WILL BE IN A TEST ONE YEAR. IN ADDITION A YOU'LL SEE THAT OF ANY THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN PROPERTY TAX. HAS LED TO AN IN IN THE GUARANTEED OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD SOME ANTICIPATING A THREE NINE TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN- I'M SORRY EIGHTEEN AT NINETEEN TWENTY. AND THEN A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR. INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OVER OUR OVER THE TO THE- NINETEEN TWENTY. ESTIMATE I'M ADDITIONAL. SOME IN THAT POSITIVE TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL STABLE. ACCOUNT A LAST YEAR I WAS WE NOTED WE HAD ALL OF THE- REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO PUT THE FIRST DEPOSIT. THROUGH THE DEPOSIT WAS THREE NINE SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. LAST YEAR AND WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY. AND INCREASED HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A WITHDRAWAL FROM THE ACCOUNT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF THIRTY EIGHT MILLION AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST TO ENSURE THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RECEIVED. AN ADJUSTMENT FOR GROWTH AND THEN ALSO IN INFLATION SCARE. IF SO AGAIN NOW WILL ALL JUST DISCUSS OF THE HIGH LEVEL EXPENDITURE FOR KATE TWELVE I WON'T GO OVER THE DETAILS BECAUSE I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE FUTURE HEARINGS ON THIS BUT SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE TO PROJECT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY TO GROW- THE STATE'S I'M UP CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR AND SIR THE END STE INSTABILITY OF. MARKETS AND ALSO. POLITICAL CLOUT. SO TO THAT IN THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN BALANCE ATTRACT ABOUT ON GO INCREASES WITH SOMEONE TIME INVESTMENTS TO ALLOW FOR SOME ROOM IN THE GUARANTEE SHOULD WE NEED TO WE CAN REDUCE EXPENDITURES WITHOUT IMPACTING ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ONGOING NATURE AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO WITH REGARD TO THAT ONGOING EXPENDITURES WE FOCUSED ON THE LARGEST PROGRAMS BY BRIGHT PROVIDING- A STATUTORY COLE OF TWO POINT 29% TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA I'M AND THEN I HAD TWENTY SIX MY DOLLARS CALL IT ALL THE OTHER CAT. BETTER IN PROP NINETY EIGHT. ON ONE OF OUR LARGEST I'M INVESTMENTS AND THOUGH THIS MONEY WAS SPENT YEAR FIRST TO. WAS ON A ONE TIME BASIS BUT WERE PROPOSING A SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVEST IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. TO BASE. FORMULA AND THEN FINE ON ONE TIME NEW TO WITH THERE'S SIXTEEN DOLLAR INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET FOR ONGOING NUTRITION PROGRAM TO INCREASE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES UP TO THE NEW CHURCH INTERNSHIP PROGRAM. SO ON MOVING ON TO ONE TIME EXPENDITURES. ON THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE SPENDING PLAN- INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME K. TWELVE AS AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. THIS REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMMAND TO IMPROVE OPPORTUNITIES AND OUTCOMES FOR EVERY CHILD IN OUR STATE IT BOUGHT BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL OF FOR DECLINE AND WHICH COULD PACK THE IN. THE PROP NINETY GUARANTEE. THESE PROPOSALS ARE TARGETED PROVIDING. AND SUPPORT TO PROBE AIMED AT CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND ENSURING THAT TEACHERS AND SCHOOL LEADERS ARE PREPARED TO- WITH THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO A- TO A TEACHER CHILDREN AND TO IMPROVE THEIR OUTCOMES. TO REFLECT THIS PRIORITY IT INCLUDES NEARLY NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EDUCATOR AGREEMENT AND TRAINING. RESEARCH INDICATES A WELL PREPARED TEACHER WORK FORCE IS SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN PREDICTING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND IN CLOSING THE SUCH A GAP HOWEVER CALIFORNIA HAS STRUGGLED WITH TRAINING AND RECRUITING TEACHERS ESPECIALLY IN OUR KEY SUBJECT AREA MATTERS AND ALSO IN HIGH NEED AREAS. SO THE FIRST I'M ART OF THE TEACHER PROPOSAL THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION IS REALLY FOCUSED ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT A GROUP IT THAT'S THREE AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS FOR THE- EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANT SOMETHING YOU SAW LAST YEAR'S BUDGET IT'S AN EXTENSION OF THAT ON THE OTHER FIVE PROPOSAL WE'LL GET INTO IN DETAIL- BUT- ARE FOCUSED MORE ON EDUCATE. RECRUITMENT AND IMPROPER. AND THIS IS NOT ONLY TEACHER NOT ONLY TEACHERS BUT ADMINISTRATORS PARA PROFESSIONALS AND ALL OF THE OTHER- STAFF THAT. WE NEED IN OUR SCHOOLS. THE STATE OF MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS EDUCATION PROPOSALS AND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMALLY OF EIGHT YEARS WHILE THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PAYING OFF AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS AND THOSE THAT LIVE IN DEEP POVERTY CONTINUES TO PERSIST SO WHAT WE'RE DOING TO THIS EDITION TO THE TEACHER WHICH WE FEEL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO CLOSING THIS GAP IN SPECIAL EDUCATION INVESTMENTS THE BUDGET INCLUDES TO PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT TARGETED RESOURCES AND STATES THAT. TO PRESS SOME OF THE IS THAT WHEN'S THESE GAPS THE FIRST A PROPOSAL TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION TO A OPPORTUNITY GRANTS THIS PROGRAM WILL TARGET THE STATE'S HIGHEST- PARTY DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS. IS THERE IN TEN. INTENT OF GRAY AND INTO. CONTENTS OF THE- WHICH I TO BE PH<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;N THIS. ISSUES THAT WERE&lt;/c&gt;</u> SEEN AND OF THESE. BUT ALSO PROPOSES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL PARTNERSHIP GRANT WHICH AGAIN IS A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN INNOVATIVE AND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL THAT WERE SEEN IN OUR SCHOOLS. NEXT TO I'D LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION THERE'S TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SATISFIED FOR A PRE SCHOOL. OF SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL EARLY INNER GEN WHICH WILL GO TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY SERVING OUR SCHOOLS STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THIS IS SIMILAR IN FACT. NEARLY SOME ARE IDENTICAL TO THE GRANTS THAT WE DID LAST YEAR IN THE SAME THERE'S SOME SLIGHT VARIATIONS THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED ON THE NEXT PANEL. THE WITH. OF ANY OTHER. YOU KNOW WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO. THE BUT I'M SURE THEY CAN WAIT TO DIFFERENT. BUT IF YOU ANY. I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER. THANK YOU MA'AM YOU PROBABLY YOU HEARD MY QUESTIONS OF THE LAST PANEL JUST TO SORT OF. I GUESS SET THIS UP BY I. IN CURIOUS AS TO WHEN WE DECIDE TO MOVE OUT WITH ONE TIME MONEY IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS. IF THERE ARE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE SAID THAT ARE SENT OUT AS TO WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE EXPENDITURE OF MONEY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS IN THE LIST THAT I'VE REVIEWED ARE EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND THEY ALL HAVE A GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEM AS- HAVE. THAT THE- EXPECT SURE WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND I THINK MAYBE. IF WE DON'T DO IT THIS YEAR ONE IF I'M STILL AROUND IN THIS YEAR WE'LL DO IT NEXT YEAR AND TAKE A LOOK BACK. AS TO HOW WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE SPENT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ON ACTS AND SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND WHY AND WHAT WE GET FROM IT SO. I'M THINKING MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THAT AT THE FRONT END. KNOWING THAT AT THE BACK AND IF I'M HERE I MAY BE ASKING QUESTIONS AND I'D HATE TO SURPRISE ANYBODY WITH MY QUESTIONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF THE EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM IS AN EXTENSION. WE HAD IT LAST YEAR. I RECALL RIGHT. WHAT WHAT RESULT DID WE GET FROM THE EXPENDITURE LAST YEAR AND IS IT TOO EARLY TO ASK THAT QUESTION. WHICH SOMETIMES IS THE CASE SO THAT'S QUESTION NUMBER ONE OR TWO. OR IS THE ISSUE WE DIDN'T SET UP ANY METRICS TO BEGIN WITH WITH THREE WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM. AND I COULD I COULD GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM. IN THE ONE TIME EXPENDITURE CATEGORY AND ASKED THE SAME QUESTION NOW THIS IS SORT OF THE OVERVIEW AND WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY LATER TO GET INTO IT BUT I'M HOPING WHEN WE COME BACK AND REVISIT SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. EITHER AT THE TIME THAT WE TAKE A VOTE OR BEFORE THE WE CONDUCT THAT SORT OF EXAMINATION BECAUSE MY THE QUESTION YOU KNOW I CAME OUT OF THE MILITARY SO. YOU KNOW GETS MEASURE GETS. AND HOW ARE WE DETERMINE WHETHER WE'VE ONE WAR OR LAW. ABOUT WE AGREE WITH YOU IN WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY SPENT IN EDUCATION OVER MANY YEARS THAT HAVE NOT HAD THAT FOLLOW UP ON ABOUT EVALUATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY ALL OF THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT YOU SEE HAVE BUILT AND EVALUATIONS AND ACCOUNTABILITY INCLUDING THE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANT WENT OUT LAST YEAR. ON INCLUDE GOING FORWARD BUT IT'S BUT IT'S VERY. STATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT. YOU WE'RE TRACKING WHERE WHERE. WHAT WORKS IF. WORTHY OF INVESTMENTS AND WHAT DOESN'T. THERE'S ALSO A DEEP COMMITMENT TO CONNECT ALL OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THESE PROGRAMS. CONNECT THEM TO THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE OPPORTUNITY GRANTS THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL THAT THIS IS WORKING WELL. ON THE COUNTIES WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PROGRAMS AND ABLE TO HELP OTHER SCHOOLS THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY RECEIVE THE GRANT. BUT SIMILAR PULLS IT JUST. IS WHAT. BE OUT OF. WORK WITH BUDGETS TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE DEEP AND FILES BUT NONE OF THAT IS IN ANALYSIS I'VE READ AND I DON'T. IT'S THE LA REPORT. SO IF SOMEONE. GOALS IN OF. ATTACHED THIS ONE EXT. PLAN IN THESE PROGRAMS. MOTHER MUST BE KEEPING HIM SOMEWHERE. THAT'S THE BILL AROUND THE FLOOR. I SEEN THEM AND I LIKE TO THEM FOR. IN THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAM. DRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES HIGH NEED SUBJECT THERE IS NO QUESTION. THAT WE NEED THAT WE NEED YOU KNOW. STEM STEAM BUT IT. TERM YOU WANT TO USE TEACHERS WE NEED THEM IN. MORE SOME AREAS A IN A SPECIAL ED INSTRUCTORS AND SPECIALISTS. BUT WHEN WE PUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLARS GRANT PROGRAM. WHAT ARE WE EXPECTING TO SEE AT THE END OF TWELVE MONTHS OR EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY FOUR. IS IT. A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE NEW TEACHERS. HUNDRED AND FIFTY RETRAIN TEACHERS. SINCE I'M NOT AN EDUCATION SPECIALISTS SOMEBODY CAN TELL ME EITHER NOW OR WHEN WE GET TO THE MORE DETAILED CONVERSATION THAT'S NOT HOW WE MEASURE THIS I'M OKAY WITH THAT THEN TO ME HOW EDUCATORS MEASURE THIS. THIS BODY MUST MEASURE IT. AND DETERMINE WHETHER THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OR A BAD JOB AND I'M JUST NOT SEEING. THE SORT OF ANALYSIS. COME FORWARD AND THE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES SO AGAIN STRAW NEARLY VALUABLE PROGRAMS. POSES MY FORMER MAYOR INTERESTS USED SAY C° TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR STEPPING OUT ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SOME DEEP THINKING BEFORE WE START GOING THE CHECKBOOK UP. AND THE SIGNATURE AROUND. HE CERTAINLY CHECK THAT COMMENT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU IN YOUR STAFF MAKING SURE THESE PROP HAVE TYPE OF THE IN MATTER THAT WOULD. MEET YOUR- PERFECT. THEIR LIVING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING AND JOINING US TODAY. OUR SPECIAL. THE I THINK YOU SAID THAT WE ARE GOING TO COME UP WITH A NEW FUNDING FORMULA FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HAVE YOU COME UP THAT FORMULA IF YOU HAVE WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE. SO I THINK THE NEXT PANEL GOING TO DISCUSS THIS MORE DETAILED AT THE BASE FOR IT. REALLY IS THE CENTER SPACE FORMULA AND JUST THE BASE OF THE FORMULA WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ALSO BUILDING AND GROUP AND STUDY AND TO DETERMINE WHAT THE- NO FOR WHICH- ANY. ON'T OF IT. BUT THIS. WHICH TO FOR FUTURE I JUST ABOUT FORMULA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM WHO'S NEXT ANY AND SENATOR CAN COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THE SERGEANT JUST PASSED AROUND. YOU KNOW A PROPOSITION EIGHT DETERMINED BY ONE OF THREE TESTS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION AND AS YOU HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION SAY. I TEST ONE IS THE OPERATIVE TEST OVER THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE PERIOD. AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE ANY CHANGES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE. THE GUARANTEE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE ABOUT FORTY CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF HIGHER LOWER REVENUE. IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF THERE ARE ANY CHANGES IN PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES THOSE AT A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR AFFECT ON ANTI. TO TRYING TO PAY ONE OF OUR HAND OUT. AS YOU HEARD ALREADY THE GUARANTEE. IN A NINETY IS A THREE HUNDRED TO ME. THAT'S MAINLY DUE TO HIGH PROPERTY TAX FROM. THE NINETEEN TWENTY GUARANTEE IS UP FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN MILLION. THAT'S MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER GENERAL FUND REVENUE. I'M WITH MOVING AHEAD TO PAGE TWO I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GUARANTEE. EIGHTY FOUR BILLION UP TWO AND A HALF BILLION OVER THE NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL. I ONE POINT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND THIS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESERVE ARE FAIRLY CLOSELY CONNECTED. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GUARANTEE IS HIGHER BY MAY. WE HAVE TO DEPOSIT MORE MONEY INTO THE STATE'S RESERVE IF THE GUARANTEE IS LOWER WE WOULD PROBABLY MAKE A LARGER WITHDRAWAL FROM THERE IS IF. I HAD TO PAY THREE. WE THINK THE- DESK. OF CHEN FUND RATHER. I READ. AT MINISTRY IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO A AND EIGHTY NINETEEN. A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN. TO A LITTLE BIT LOW. IN TWENTY TWO ONE. BUT THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OUR ESTIMATES LESS THAN A HUNDRED. DIFFERENT SO WHICH OF THE IDENTICAL FOR A- STATE BUDGET PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MY- SOME RISKS TO STATE. AT ACTIVE A SLOW. IN JOB GROWTH ISN'T AS FAST AS IT WAS PREVIOUSLY- BUT BASED ON WHAT WE NOTED NO TODAY WE THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS PUT FORWARD A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF STATE REVENUE AND THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. THE MINISTRY IS ABOVE US ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MILLION ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX ESTIMATES. I YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM US ABOUT THAT I WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BUT I THINK- WE ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES WILL NARROW BY THE TIME WE DO OUR NEXT OUTLOOK IT MAY. TURNING TO PAGE FOR. ALL OF THE INCREASES IN THE GUARANTEES SUPPORT ABOUT FOUR BILLION IN NEW SPENDING FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OF SPECIFIC PROPOSALS ARE DIVIDED ABOUT EVENLY BETWEEN NEW ONE TIME SPENDING AND YOU I'M GOING SPENDING. FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS NO ALL THE ON IN FUNDING THIS TO SUPPORT THE TWO POINT 29% COST OF LIVING IN. WENT ONE TIME. IS FOR THAT COULD DIMINISH AROUND EDUCATION WORK FORCE. OR FOR IMPROVING ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AT CERTAIN LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS. PAGE FIVE IS JUST A RUNDOWN OF THIS THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THEY WON'T COVER THAT ANY ANY DETAIL YOU GET INTO ALL OF THOSE LATER THIS YEAR. I TURNING TO PAGE SIX. I WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS SOME POSITIVE COMPONENTS AND- I THINK MR SURE YOU ARTICULATED THEM VERY WELL- THERE'S A MIX. OF A ONE TIME AN ONGOING PROPOSALS- WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU A LITTLE BIT OF A BUDGET CUSHION IN CASE THE MINIMUM. THE CLIENT. HEY WHAT'S A LOT LESS JUST. TO ADJUST ONE TIME SPENDING TO ADJUST ONGOING A- ON GOING PROGRAM CAL CFF. THE BUT DRAWS ATTENTION JUST. WHO'S MANY JUST TO WITH ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND MANY DISTRICTS HAVE TO FINE TEACHERS CERTAIN SOME AREA. ARE TURNING TO PAGE SO I THINK US. YOU'VE A PARTICULAR SOME OF I CAN ARE A WE THINK THAT SOME OF THE- WOULD NOT ADDRESS THE UNDER. CAUSES OF THE PROBLEMS THE GOV IS CAN. OUR CONCERN THAT SOME THE OLD NOT ALLOW WITH THE STATE'S SIX EFFORT TO A- UP ACHIEVE AND- WORK FIRST HIS. AND WE CAN ABOUT THE GROUP THAT HAVE VERY MUCH DETAIL A HOW THE FOR WOULD BE YOU. IF THE TO EVALUATE IT. GET ME SIR THAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT PROVIDE. ALL THAT MUCH IN FISCAL RELIEF FOR DOES. DISTRICTS ARE FACED HIGHER COST PER FOR VARIOUS SOURCES PER HIGHER PENSION AND GROWTH AND STUFF EDUCATION COSTS. AT THE BUDGET DOES THAT COLA BUT GIVEN ALL OF PRESSURE WITHIN DISTRICTS ARE LOOKING AT. IT BUT SITUATION NEXT YEAR. FIND TURNING TO PAGE EIGHT. AM AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD RECKON YOU CAN TO BUILD A BUDGET THAT RELY ON A MIX OF ONE TIME AN ONGOING SPENDING. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THE EXACT SAME ACCESS WHAT THE GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD BUT THAT IS A REASON STARTING POINT. I WOULD RECOMMEND FUNDING. WILL GOVERNOR'S ONE TIME PROPOSALS FOR. SO ON THE ONES THAT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS AND HAVE CLEAR OBJECTIVES AND SPENDING REQUIREMENTS. WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT MOST OF THE GULF. THERE'S OTHER ONE TIME PROPOSALS. IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD FREE UP ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS INSIDE. NINE FOR OTHER PRIORITY. AND FINE WE AND YOU THE FREED UP FUNDING GROUP DISK RELIEF. YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN GO UP THAT. WE THINK THE MOST PROMISING OPTION WOULD BE TO HELP PAY DOWN DISTRICT FUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES THAT WOULD BOTH. FISCAL HEALTH OF THE CONCERT. IT COULD ALSO DISTRICTS WITH TO LEAP ON ASSISTING BASIS. IN ADDITION TO PAYING DOWN ABILITY WE THINK YOU COULD COME USING A PORTION OF THAT PENSION FUNDING REDUCED AND COSTS. AND TWENTY ONE. RIGHT NOW DISTRICT PENSION COSTS ARE SCHEDULED TO GO UP THE NEXT YEAR THEN COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT THE FOLLOWING YEAR. JUST COULD USE ABOUT THREE MILLION TO SOME WITHOUT THAT PENSION COSTS TOM AND ALLOW COST TO GO MOST MORE SLOWLY AND STEADILY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. I THAT'S REALLY OUR TAKE ON THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WELL THEY'RE LIVING QUESTIONS TO. GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE COMING FROM THE LABOR. I ALWAYS IT'S A GREAT IDEA TO PAY DOWN PENSION OBLIGATIONS SO THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT. DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER. OF THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST TO US- ON PAYING DOWN. I MEAN I WOULD WE DO LAST YEAR. FIFTY MILLION HELLO LAST YEAR WAS A WAS A PAYMENT FOR BOTH OF THE PENSION SYSTEMS BOTH CHARACTERS IN CALPERS A LITTLE OVER THREE BILLION AND IT WAS SUPPOSED TO PAY DOWN OF. THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES PLUS IMMEDIATE RELIEF OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS SO IF YOU'RE SUGGESTING WE PAY DOWN THERE UNFUNDED LIABILITY THIS YEAR BUT DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER. IF YOU REJECTED ALL OF THE IF YOU ADOPTED ALL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT A BILLION. YOU COULD ALSO YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S INTEREST IN USING SOME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AS WELL I'VE YOU CAN ONLY DO THAT. KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE TRADE OFF TO BETWEEN DATA NEEDS TO PROGRAM. MISSION THANK YOU. AFTER THEY WERE PROPOSED THAT BILLION AND THEN USE A PENSION PAID OUT GOT IT AND HOW MUCH I KNOW IT WOULD VERY BASS DOES TO SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU HAVE ANY AYE PER WERE MAYBE HOW MUCH MONEY THIS COULD FOR UP FOR SCHOOL THIS. IT DEPEND ON HOW YOU GIVE IT UP. BUT SPECIFIC IN HERE IT COULD BE A- OTHER ELITE SAMPLE IF YOU THAT FOR MILLION SET ASIDE. THAT'S THREE HUNDRED MILLION IN SAVINGS FOR SCHOOLS COMMUNITY. IF YOU DID OF UNFUNDED LIGHT PAY DOWN YOU'D GET. A MUCH LARGER AMOUNT OF SAVINGS OVER TIME BUT NOT AS MUCH IN THE NEXT COUPLE IS YOU GET UP. YOU CAN GET A POTENTIAL. BUT TO GET THAT SAVED OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES. GOT IT THANK YOU VERY HELPFUL. WE'LL FIND IT YOU CAN SEE THE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS AT SOME POINT HERE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT ON THE ONE TIME SPENDING IN THE PROGRAM'S FIGURE OUT. WHAT EXACTLY- V. EXPERTS HOPE TO SEE ACCOMPLISHED A ONE TIME EXPENDITURE OF THE MONEY SO WE CAN TRIAGE THE EXPENDITURES AND DECIDE. TO THE EXTENT WE NEED SIDE WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT AND THAT THE SHOULD BE. HAVE COME. A CAR. PENSION LEAVE WHETHER WE SEND IT TO AS RING TO GET TO IN A FEW ADDITIONAL SPUR. CASE FUNDING THAT THIS. DARE HAVING TO DIG OF THEIR CHEN. ANYWAY OR WHETHER WE FIND TIME AT. PRO THE MAY OR MAY NOT. COME THE SAME DEGREE OF. FISSION SEE IN A DIFFERENCE AND SHE- SO. LOOK FOR TO THE CAN CAL. YEAH WE LOOK WITH WELL LOOK FOR TO THOSE COVER. I WOULD LIKE TO OUR NOTE OF CA. IN THE PAST THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANY MONEY PROVIDED TO THE STATE AND FOR PER. THIRDS HAS DONE ON A NINETY SIDE OF BUDGET TO DO. THE BILLION DOLLARS WITHIN THE- WE BE NAY OF. A DIFFERENT PROPOSED. RESEARCH BUT WELL THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IF THEY HAVE AN UNFUNDED LIABILITY THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY IF YOU MAKE AN ON BEHIND THE MONEY THEY CRIED AS THEY PLAYED AT A NINETY EIGHT SO WHETHER THEY PAY AT A NINETY EIGHT OR- NINETY EIGHT OR WE PUT OUT OF SOMETHING ELSE. IT CAN COME OUT OF ANY OF THE POTS. SEEMS TO ME. OKAY ANYBODY ELSE- BEFORE I LET YOU GO MISTER ELIO CAN YOU COMMENT ON MY- I WAS READING YOUR REPORT THIS REPORT HERE ON PAGE TWENTY TWO AND MY PRINCIPLE OR OTHER. SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR STATISTIC VERSUS TEACHER WHO WON YES HELLO MY COLLEAGUE WILK AND SAYS I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR ME YES FOR A GROUP CALLED THE ONLY WAY I CAN COME AND I THINK THAT. THAT DATA SOURCES BETTER LIVING THE CONVERSATION TO SOME OF ISSUE. THERE THAT THAT THEY'VE PRETTY. THAT'S A INDIVIDUAL WHAT AND CREDENTIAL AND THAT CAN BE AN A VARIETY OF- POSITIONS IN A SCHOOL OR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SO I CAN INCLUDE PRINTABLE THERE'S THE- BUT OUT OF THE- SO WHAT COULD. SOMEONE CURRICULUM BUT ALSO GETTING. OUR STAFF TO MY NOT BE SOME OF THE MAY BE ON THIS SITE FROM THE MAY BE SAY FOR THEM AT A DISTRICT OFF ADMIN WORK WITHIN SCHOOLS OUT AND THE THING ON ON THE CASE SO THERE IS A IT'S A BROAD CHARACTER CATTLE TURNBERRY PROBABLY RIGHT IN THE NUMBER TO YOU LOOKS PRETTY BIG IN TERMS OF A RATIO BECAUSE TEACHERS AND IT. THE THIRTY. I THINK THE WILL GO CAN LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE PULL THE FROM I DON'T THINK WE'RE ABLE TO PULL SEPARATE OUT SO MANY OF THOSE ARE JUST PRINCIPLES VERSES OTHER POSITION BUT WE IF WE DO HAVE THAT ABILITY WE CAN TRY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH YOU. SAY IT'S ON. TWENTY TWO OF THE YES. I WILL NOTE THAT THE- LA- PULLS OUT IN A SEPARATE CATEGORY. STUDENT SERVICES STAFF SO CANCERS PSYCHOLOGISTS SOCIAL WORKERS NURSES SPEECH AND LANGUAGE. SPECIALIST IN LIBRARIANS APPEAR TO BE A DIFFERENT CATEGORY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE- DIFFERENT CREDENTIALS AND SO. WHY I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF. A DISCO THIS. SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING SO I'M NOT. DWELL ON ANYMORE BUT I WOULD LIKE SOME DATA FROM SOMEBODY AS TO WHAT. THIS MEANS BECAUSE- TWO WILL. PRINCE OF OTHER SCHOOL IN. TWO ELEVEN F. T. TEACHER RATIO. IS A BETTER RATIO THAN OUR STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIOS SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEBODY'S TAKING A LOOK AT THAT EVEN IF IT'S NOT ME AND THIS SUBCOMMITTEE OKAY SO MAYBE YOU ALL CAN GET TOGETHER AND YET ONLY WHAT I'M WHAT I'M MISSING OR WHICH DATA POINT I NEED TO HELP OUR- GREAT. THIRTY ON. YOUR GO BACK TO WORK WITH YOUR SEVEN THE SUMMER MISSION AND I WOULD SAY ON THIS AS WE BECAUSE IT'S A BRA TERM IT REVERSED A LOT OF POSITIONS THAT EITHER WE ARE SCHOOL SITE OR A DISTRICT CAMPUS MANY OF THEM ARE ARE. THINGS THAT ARE- I THINK NOT THAT'S A CONSIDERED SERVER. ADMIN BUT DOING SOMETHING THAT THAT THEY MIGHT BE WORKING IN MULTIPLE SCHOOLS THEY MIGHT BE DOING THINGS LIKE. COACHING AUTUMN THAT ARE THAT THERE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE BETTER NOT SORT OF THING WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT THEM WITH THAT. IN THE CLASSROOM OR OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM- I WOULD ALSO JUST ON THE ADMINISTRATOR ISSUES ON MOST OF. THE TH RECOGNITION WIDE RANKINGS ON HOW WE DO ON THE NEWS. JUSTICE STUDENTS IS USUALLY THE THAT'S DONE. CALIFORNIA USE RANK VERY HIGH IN TERMS OF WHAT THOSE WITH THOSE NUMBERS ARE SOFT. WELL WE'VE BEEN CRITICAL YEAH I'M EVERY JOB IS A VALUABLE JOB AN EDUCATION AND ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY DOES TO CONTRIBUTE TO EDUCATION OF THE- YOUNG AND NOT SO YOUNG IN OUR STATE IS. CRITICAL SO. JUST INTEREST. OR DATA IT JUST CAUGHT MY EYE. I WILL. TAKE ANYMORE TIME BUT WE CAN. SEVERAL OUTSIDE THIS UP. HAVE A COVERS A WITH THE- IN. WHAT OF THIS. MEANS THAT. I CAN YOU OFF THE YOU WERE GOING TO TALK TO BUT SOMETHING ELSE ANOTHER DOES IT. I THINK. OKAY I'LL JUST READ CONVERSATIONS. I KNOW THE SUPER. OKAY THIS MORNING BUT REGARD SPECIFICALLY THE SPECIALIZED WERE EXCITED ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES. EXIST IN THIS BUDGET FOR. BECAUSE I'LL BE SHARING SOME A LITTLE BIT A DATE WITH THE ON THE NEXT PANEL TO SHOWCASE OR THE CORRELATION BETWEEN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING AT THE STATE- OVERALL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA AND WHAT TYPES OF SPENDING INITIATIVES ARE BEING PUT IN PLACE PARTICULARLY I'LL JUST MENTION SAYS TO- RESERVE EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN STARTING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD IN PRESCHOOL REALLY- SETTING THAT RESETTING THAT ON RAMP FOR HIS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- IS GONNA BE CRITICAL. AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME IDENTIFIED BARRIER. STUDENTS WHO DISABILITY ARE NOT SIXTY TING CATION. AND SOME OF THOSE ARE ALSO MENTIONED THEM IN THE BUDGET INCLUDING- THE HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND FROM OTHER AREAS. ONE OF THE- IT'S NO SECRET TO ANYONE THAT SPECIALIZED FUNDING CONTINUES TO BE- SOMETHING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION IN EVERY DISTRICT THAT WE GO TO ESPECIALLY WITH THE DISTRICTS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH AND- I WOULD SAY BECAUSE OF- IN PART. THE UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT WE HAVE FROM THE FIFTH THAT'S BUT ALSO BECAUSE- IT DOES WE DO HAVE STUDENTS WHO ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AND REQUIRE A HIGHER LEVEL OF SUPPORT AND SERVICE THAN OTHER STUDENTS. TO BE ABLE. TO FOR ME. AT THE LEVEL OF. IF CDS WHICH IN OUR- SOME HAS MOVED FROM A LOW DRIVEN. A EAST BE MILD TO MODERATE. TEACHERS AND MUCH OF YOUR TEACHERS- S. SPEND CHANGED TO- TEACHERS THAT SERVE STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE SUPPORT NEEDS AN EXTENSIVE SUPPORT NEED I KNOW THAT. I'M ALL NEW THAT REALLY OUT THERE WILL BE STUDENTS RIVER RIDGE I LOVE CARE AND SERVICE. AND SO THAT REALLY DOES DUBBED. WELL WITH THE COMMUNITY THIS WHOLE IDEA OF COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THIS GREAT FOUNDATION OF- EXPERTISE AND CARE AT SCHOOL SITES WHICH THEN IT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES WHO A LOT OF TIMES YOU BRING IN SUPPORT. THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY HAVE ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT- TO BE HOPEFUL FOR IN THE APPS AND WE STAND READY. TO DO THE WORK AND ALSO A PACK SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO THE- FACT OUT IN THE DESERT. I DO A LITTLE MORE DATA CANNOT DO TELL ARE YOU WELL I WILL THIS GOOD NOW WE CAN PUT INTO THE NEXT PANEL. ARE YOU JUST BE. THIS MIGHT BE A BEAST TO. OUR AS OPPOSED TO. DOING AN OVERLY FOR MY- AND SEVERELY. I'M ONLY SUGGESTING THAT WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE FUNDING FORMULA IN GENERAL BUT THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH TO SYSTEM. AT LEAST TALK ABOUT TO SUSTAIN A BASE THAT MORE EQUITABLE AND THEN WE LOOK AT WHAT YOU KNOW HOW WHAT ARE OTHER IT'S STILL. HOW CAN WE SORT OF LOOK AT OUR- OPTIONS. AND ALL A GRAPH. REALLY THAT OVERLOOKED IN POPULAR STUDENTS ABILITIES ARE NOT JUST STUDENTS WITH THIS. THEY'RE ALL FOSTER YOU. LEARNER SINCE. BUT WE DON'T. MONEY THE SPECIAL CAN I DON'T THINK MANY DISPUTE ABOUT THE QUESTION IS HOW THE WAY THE WAY WE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED UNDER THAT SIX OF TWO FORMULA. AND THE FAN THE FUNDING ALLOCATION THAT WAS LOCKED IN PLACE WHEN WE SET THAT IN CONCRETE AND HOW WE EQUALIZE THE YOU KNOW THE PER STUDENT- DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS. AND THAT NOW HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT THE INCREASING NUMBERS OF MODERATELY TO SEVERELY DISABLED THIS. ACROSS IN A SETTING WHERE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T GET ENOUGH MONEY TO BEGIN WITH THE EDUCATE THOSE WITH DISABILITIES SO IT'S GONNA BE VERY INSTANT CARS ISSUE MAY WE CAN STARTED AT THE NEXT PANEL BUT I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO SCHEDULE LONGER HEARINGS ONLY IF WE STOP. MAYBE SIX OF TO WHICH MAYBE WE DO THANK. ELSE PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RUN SPECIALIST RIGHT ISSUE THREE. TO SIX PAYROLL. THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO AND SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING PROPOSALS AND WE HAVE A- MOSTLY NEW PANEL IN FRONT OF US. SO WE'LL DO THE SAME ROUTINE VELASCO ASK YOU TO IDENTIFY YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD MA'AM ME ASK YOU AGAIN STARTING TO MY LEFT TO RIGHT. HELLO KRISTEN WHEN YOU DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION THANK YOU FOR NOT RUNNING AWAY YES MA'AM HI GOOD MORNING MICHELLE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SHOW. WITH MY WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. EMILY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US. AND YOUR HERE'S WHAT. ROTH ELICITED OFF OF THANK YOU OKAY WHO WANTS TO START VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU MA'AM MAKE GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS LIST MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE I GET STARTED I WANTED TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND TO OUR OFFICE SO BETWEEN NINETEEN BUT ACT LAID OUT A CHARGE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE AND ON STAKEHOLDERS TO COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE. SPECIAL EDUCATION WITH THE FOCUS ON IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES SO- AS PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE SPOKE AND MATT WITH AND MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS HELPERS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT IS WORKING WELL IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND WHAT NECESSARY IS ARE NEEDED. IN ORDER TO BETTER SUPPORT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. AND FOR THIS CONVERSATION CAME SEVERAL THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT TODAY. AND I WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF A MULTI YEAR MULTI FAITH EFFORT OF SPECIAL EDUCATION REFORM. AND OF COURSE THOUGHTFUL COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS IS. REQUIRED FOR US TO ACHIEVE OUR SHARED GOALS OF- SUPPORTING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES AND ENSURING EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES FOR ALL STUDENTS. AND SO WITH ALL OF THAT THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN OVERHAUL OF THE SPECIAL- EDUCATION BASE FUNDING FORMULA. SO IN THE HANDOUT THAT THE SERGEANT. BROUGHT AROUND. AND YOU'LL SEE THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CURRENT FUNDING FORMULA WHICH IS EIGHTY SIX IT TOO AND THE PROPOSED BASE FORMULA. SO IN ORDER TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY FUNDING WOULD BE CALCULATED OUT THE LA LEVEL AND SAID OF THE SUPPLE LEVEL ALTHOUGH TOTAL FUNDING WILL STILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE SOUTH AS FOR DISTRIBUTION ON THE STATUS QUO UNFUNDED EIGHTY A WOULD BE CALCULATED AS A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE- AND- IT IS BECAUSE PRIOR YEAR AND PRIOR PRIOR YEAR EIGHTY A. M. SUPPOSED TO KERN EIGHTY SIX. WHICH AND THE GROUP OF THE CURRENT YEAR PRIOR YEAR OR PRIOR PRIOR YEAR EIGHTY A AT THE SILVA. I AM AND ASK FOR THE BASE THREE MOST LEDS WILL SEE A BOOST IN THEIR BASE RATE- ELLIE IS CURRENTLY BELOW SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY PER STUDENT WILL RECEIVE A RATE OF SIX SIXTY AND THE ONLY A STOCK ARE ABOVE. THAT SIT SEE NUMBER WELCOME TO GET THEIR NINETEEN TWENTY AB SIXTY TWO RATE ADJUSTED FOR COST OF LIVING. AS FOR THE ON ON ALL AB SIXTY TWO OUT ON THE FROZEN AS A ARE FOR TWO YEARS- IF. THEY RECEIVE CALL UNDER AB SIXTY TWO THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THOUGHT. IN MY COLLEAGUE HAS MORE INFORMATION ON THE OTHER PROPOSALS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. ALL OF THE QUESTION ALL OF THE QUESTION ON THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. WHEN WE GET TO THAT OKAY MISS MY THAT'S NOT YOU RIGHT. HELLO THERE YEAH OKAY. YEAH I CAN HELP OUT WITH THAT SO AGAIN THE SHOVEL DEVELOPMENT OF FINANCE I'M GONNA GO OVER SOME OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR DESK AND AS MY WEEK MAN. I'M I JUST IT IS THE MULTI MULTI FOR PROCESS ON THIS FIRST PHASE IS THE FOCUS ON INCREASE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING INCLUDING FUNDING TO SUPPORT PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. AND IT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON MAKING INVESTMENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS UNNECESSARY AND COMING TO US. ZERO WE CAN. WHEN THERE'S- IN ADDITION. HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING NINETY EIGHT FOR A- EARLY IN OF SERVICE. FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. I'M FINE WOULD BE A- ON A ONE BASIS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO FUNDING LAST YEAR- SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH THIS. PLEASE I'M HOWEVER THIS IS THE FUNDING IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND THAT IT WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO INCREASED OR IMPROVED SERVICES STUDENT DISABILITIES OR IT COULD ALSO BE USED FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FIRST. P. AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS ABOUT THIS ARE REALLY TO THIS FUNDING IS. AROUND ISSUES OF IMPACT- A DISTRICTS MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT- AMMO E. AND WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THOSE CONCERNS AND WE'RE DEFINITELY TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. I'M HOWEVER WE WOULD LIKETO US THAT WE DON'T THINK IT WOULD NECESSARILY IMPACT AND EMILY IF IT IS WAS FOR- AN EARLY INTERVENTION SUPPORTS. AND PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WORKING ON MTS HAS- THINGS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN AN IP BUT THEY COULD STILL HELP YOUNG STRUGGLING LEARNERS- BUT AGAIN. LISTENING TO THOSE CONCERNS. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT- FOR A STUDY OF THE CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S VISION IS FOR THE STUDY TO EXAMINE DELIVERY SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABILITY AND HAD A SUPPORT ELEAZAR TO ENSURE STUDENTS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- HOWEVER WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL. I'M FINALLY FINDING THE SCOPE OF THE STUDY. FINALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSALS- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME FOR TWO WORK GROUPS THAT. WHERE AND BEFORE WE WORK GROUP WILL EXAMINE AND PROPOSED ALTERNATE PATHWAYS TO A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES- AS WE HEARD ON OUR SITE IT'S AS THE SUMMER AND I THINK AS- KRISTIN RIVAL A SPEAK ABOUT. INTO MANY STUDENTS ARE PLACED ON THE TICKET TO COMPLETION TRACK WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE- AND CREATES BARRIERS SECONDARY PLANS FOR. THE DISABILITY SINCE SUPPORT GROUP IS REALLY LOOKING AT ENSURING THAT ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO GRADUATE WITH A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. AND THEN THE FINALLY OTHER BULLOCKS. FINING FIFTH Y. DANDER. TEMPLATE I CAN GET BOGGED BY COMPLY MAN AND THERE'S AN- IN EXAMINING HOW PIECE COULD BE BETTER DEFINED TO IMPROVE OUR STRENGTH. SOME STUDENTS. OF COURSE. PERCENT OF THE- NEVER. THIS IS A FREE BILL LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE FROM AT LEAST OF COURSE AND OF COURSE THE STAFF OTHER RATHER STAKE I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT I KNOW THERE'S SOME ON BUT YEAH MICHAEL YEAH TO TAKE QUESTIONS FLORA A QUESTION ON THAT BEFORE MARK THE ONLY. IF IN THIS QUESTION ON THE TO A FIFTH MILLION DOLLARS IN A WHISPER A LITTLE BIT ON THIS LAST YEAR IN THIS BY OF. THE FOR TO FIVE YEAR OLDS AND HOW WE INCREASE FUNDING- IN SPECIAL AND YOU KNOW EVERY DOLLAR OF INCREASES OF IS A BENEFIT. JUST ABOUT IT I'M SURE EVERY DISTRICT I WAS GONNA SAY JUST ABOUT EVERY DISTRICT BUT EVERY DISTRICT. SO WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HOW DO YOU I REALIZE IT'S ALSO SAYS IMPROVE BUT YOU IN ZURICH OR PROVE SERVICES. IF YOU DON'T. AT PERSONNEL. AND IF YOU ED PERSONNEL HOW DO YOU IN PERSONNEL IF THE MONEY'S ONE TIME SO THAT'S SORT OF A TWO PART QUESTION AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU THE THIRD QUESTION IN ADVANCE WHICH IS WHETHER WE TAKE THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AREA THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS EARLY INTERVENTION. I BELIEVE THE LA- IS SUGGESTED BUT- REGARDLESS WHY DON'T WE TAKE THAT AND JUST CALL IT ON TIME. ONGOING RATHER ONGOING FUNDING AND ALLOW THE DISTRICTS TO SET UP AN RELY ON A CERTAIN FUNDING STREAM. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS THAT. NO TO DATE THEY'VE HAD DIFFICULTY DOING. THOSE ARE THE THREE QUESTIONS PROJECTS THE TOTALS ONLY AS ONE OF TIME BUT IN MOSCOW YOU GET THREE OKAY HOPEFULLY I CAN ANSWER THREE OF THEM ARE MEMBER TO ANSWER YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT- HOW DO WE YOU KNOW PROVIDE INCREASED IMPROVE SERVICES. WITHOUT ADDING PERSON NOW- I THINK THAT IN OUR SIDE THIS IS A SUMMER AND WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE YOU KNOW TRYING TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN- BUT THEY'RE COMING TO A LOT OF BARRIERS WITH. EVEN FINDING PERSONAL ALMOND SO THEY'RE HAVING TO CONTRACT FOR SERVICES AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF- CONTRACTING FOR SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST FOR EXAMPLE AS WE KNOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE. A SHORTAGE THOSE. OF YOU SO THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO HIRE SOMEBODY SO WE GIVE THE MONEY WE ALLOWED THEM TO HER. SO MAYBE THEY BUMP THE CUT THE WAGE AND BENEFIT PACKAGE UP FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN DO AND THE EDUCATE ENVIRONMENT. SO PUTTING ON A PER. IT'S ONE TIME MONEY AND DOESN'T THAT MEAN IF THE MONEY ISN'T THERE NEXT YEAR THAT WE THEN DO WHAT WE LEYVA PERSON OFF FOR WE SHIP FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE OR WE CANCEL THE PROGRAM I MEAN I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE- THE LOGIC HERE. BECAUSE THE USE OF THE PHRASE INCREASED OR IMPROVED SERVICES IS NOT MY PHRASE THAT'S THE PHRASE THE ADMINISTRATION USED IN PUTTING FORTH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THAT TO ME MEANS YOU'VE ADDED SOMETHING AND YOU'VE ADDED SOMETHING WAS ONE TIME MONEY WHICH DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AM I MAKING IN MY MAKING SENSE YES I THINK SO OF IT WHERE YOU CAN SAY NO. I I'M UP. YOU KNOW I'M A ONE YEAR IN A ROOM FULL OF EXPERTS OF NOT EVERYTHING I SAY MAKES SENSE GO AHEAD. OF ME YEAH I KNOW AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A GREAT- POINT AND WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THOSE CONCERNS INTO CONSIDERATION- AGAIN THE FUNDING CAN ALSO BE USED AS FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES MORE BROADLY ON TO EXPAND AND TSS RIGHT TO. THIS KIND OF BUILD MORE SUPPORT BY THE CONTRACTING WHETHER DOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT WHICH TENDS TO BE ONE TIME- COULD REALLY HELP THOSE YOUNG LEARNERS. BUT BUT WE DEFINITELY YOU. DELIVERY OF QUOTE. IDEA THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE BUT MY QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SELF US US I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BOTH OF YOU OR THE FIRST- LADY THAT PRESENTED. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY ONE OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISLIKE SELFLESS SO MUCH THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE SELF WAS. FOR ONLY THERE TO DENY SERVICES. TO THE STUDENTS AND THE WIND UP IN A LOT OF LAWSUITS AT- THIS PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND I THINK OTHER DISTRICTS TO I THINK THIS DISTRICT JUST HAPPENS TO BE. A BIT MORE. ALL SO DO YOU THINK THAT. CHANGING THIS FORMULA FROM THE A. B. SIX SO TWO FORMULA THE EIGHTY A CALCULATION WHICH CURRENTLY IS AT THE SUPPLE LEVEL. CALCULATED AT THE LA A LEVEL. WITH THAT DAY IN DO YOU HEAR OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT HAPPY WITH SELF AS- SORRY IT'S KIND OF A CONVOLUTED QUESTION. THREE AND SO WHY CAN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THAT PARTICULAR ELEMENT IN THERE HELP US- WE'VE HEARD JUST MAKES THINGS AND I THINK THAT. SO THE REASON WHY WE WANTED TO DO THESE CALCULATIONS AT THE LA LEVEL IS BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY HAS BEEN- SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD AS A CONCERN OF AND THE AS THE SB SIX MODEL STANDS IT DOESN'T REALLY REFLECT THE GROWTH OR DECLINE- OF INDIVIDUAL ELEAZAR REALLY JUST TAKES THE SALT INTO ACCOUNT. AN AN **** OR YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF AN REALIZE SERVICES AND THAT RELATIONSHIP IT VARIES SO MUCH ACROSS THE STATE WHICH IS AGAIN AS MY COLLEAGUE WITH PAYING WHY WE ARE. THIS GOVERNMENT SO THAT WE EXAMINE THIS BECAUSE OF THIS AND IS A OF A BLACK THAT WE ARE NOT QUITE SURE OF. THAT IS FAIR SO YOU'RE BEING THAT CALCULATING THE EIGHTY A CALCULATION OF THE VALLEY A LEVEL WILL GIVE US BETTER TRANSPARENCY THAN DOING IT NOW WITH THE SELF LEVEL. YES OKAY WELL TRANSPARENT IS ALWAYS THANKS THANK YOU. THERE'S ANOTHER STEP BECOMING OUT ISN'T THERE IS PRIVATE STUDY GOING ON. AND SO THERE IS A- STUDY THAT WAS PRIVATELY COMMISSIONED AND- THAT IS BEING CONDUCTED BY WEST ED AND THAT IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE FINANCING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND- SO FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK I AM THE FINANCING OF SPECIAL EDUCATION CALIFORNIA. HASN'T REALLY BEEN DONE IN OVER TWENTY YEARS SO I BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE- JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE AND GET SOME CLARITY ON THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THINGS STAND AT THIS CURRENT JUNCTURE NOW WITH JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE STUDY THAT'S CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IN THE APPROPRIATIONS DO WE HAVE SOME. CLEAR QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE ASKING- BE ADDRESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STUDY SELF OF WAS MENTIONED. SO I C&lt;c.cyan&gt; I&lt;/c&gt; CAN TAKE BACK SO AGAIN ADMINISTRATION VISION IS FOR TO LOOK AT GOVERNANCE ACCOUNTABILITY- YOU KNOW SINCE THE CREATION OF SELFIES THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AND EDUCATION GENERALLY WITH THE CREATION OF. ON THE AL CAPP RIGHT THE DASHBOARD- ANDSO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED BE LOOK AT IN THE STUDY AGAIN WE ARE VERY OPEN TO WORKING WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF. QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANSWERED AROUND GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. WELL I ASSUME WOULD NOT. WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY KNOWING. THAT PART OF THE- RATIONALE FOR THE SELF OF CREATION AND THE WAY BACK WAS TO CENTRALIZE RESOURCES AND PROVIDE SOME CENTRALIZATION OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES THAT A PARTICULAR DISTRICT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO MAINTAIN- ON AN ON CALL ARE AS NEEDED BASIS IS THAT. CORRECT YEAH DEFINITELY SO THEY WERE CREATED TO CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALE RIGHT- IN PER CAPITA I SUPPORT- SINCE YOU KNOW SINCE THEN THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF- THE CREATION OF SINGLE DISTRICTS HELP US- AND SO THEY'RE JUST BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AROUND THAT ENDS THAT NEED TO BE FURTHER LOOKED AT AND STUDIED. RIGHT I SUPPOSE ECONOMIES SCALE ONE THING THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT MONEY STILL HAS TO FLOW. IN THAT DIRECT WHICH I ASSUME IS ONE OF THE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THIS STUDY THAT YOU ARE GOING COMMISSION. CORRECT YEAH LOOKING AT THE FUNDING AND HOW IT INTERACTS WITH EVIDENCE. THAT THE OTHER QUESTIONS EARLIER. WHO'S NEXT. GOOD MORNING SENATOR IS AMY LEE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE SERGEANTS SHOULD HAVE DISTRIBUTED A HANDOUT FROM CHILD SPEAKING WITH ON TODAY SO TURNING TO PAGE ONE JUST BRIEFLY BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AND ELEVEN POINT 7% OF K. TWELVE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AND THIS YEAR HAS BEEN STEADILY INCREASING FOR THE PAST DECADE ALONG WITH THE INCREASE IN IDENTIFICATION RATES HAVE. INCREASED IS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS I'M SO AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE FIGURE ON PAGE ON. SO STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING LEVELS HAVE MAINLY ROOM REMAINS THE SAME AS A RESULT LOCAL GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING MOSTLY THERE I'LL SEE IF I HAVE HAVE BEEN COVERING A GROWING SHARE OF THIS COST SUCH THAT LOCAL FUNDING COVERS ABOUT 60% OF COST COMPARED 250% A DECADE AGO. TWO TWO FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO THESE GROWING COST. FIRST THE SHARE OF STUDENTS WITH RELATIVELY SEVERE DISABILITIES HAS ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NOW CONSISTS OF 3% OF OVERALL STUDENT ENROLLMENT. THESE DISABILITIES TYPICALLY ARE MORE IN REQUIRE MORE INTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE SERVICES. AND THE MOST NOTABLE RISES IN AUTISM WHICH AFFECTED ONE IN SIX HUNDRED STUDENTS AT THE TO TECH TWO DECADES AGO. COMPARED TO ONE IN FIFTY STUDENTS TODAY SO THAT'S ALMOST TWELVE FOLD INCREASE. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IS A RISE IN TEACHER SALARY AND PENSION COSTS ARE WHICH ARE ALL AFFECTING GENERAL EDUCATION AS WELL. MOVING ON TO EACH. OTHER PHIL AT AT CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL OBVIOUSLY PROVIDES FUNDING BASED ON OVERALL STUDENT ATTENDANCE- AND STUDENT TENDONS IS USED RATHER THAN A MORE DIRECT MEASURE OF COST. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT THAT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO OVER IDENTIFY STUDENTS OR SERVE STREETS AND UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE WAYS WE THINK THIS BREAKS THE FACT THAT HIGH BETWEEN. BEING AN IDENTIFICATION FOR STUDENTS. COVERED THE- ENDING AT THE PER STUDENT FUNDING RATES UNDER AB SIXTY TWO HAVE LARGELY VARIED BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL REASONS- AS FINANCE HAS ALREADY MENTIONED IN THAT NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AND THERE WAS A DIRECTIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAKE STATUTORY CHANGES TO. THAT WERE DESIGNED OF ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS- AS- A REAL RESPONSIVE TO THAT DATE MINISTRATION ENDED UP IDENTIFYING SEVERAL CHALLENGES- IN SPECIAL EDUCATION AND RELATED TO GROWING. STATE MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS FEATURES THAT ARE NOT PREPARED FOR INCLUDES A PACK PRACTICES STORAGE IS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS AND SPECIALISTS AND- BACK OF CLEARING THE SCENE GEN FROM THE C. TO PROMOTE. THE PRACTICES. THIRTY ADDRESS THESE IT THE GOVERNOR. TO MAKE REFORMS IN. CATION FINANCE AND OTHER. I A MORE FEES. AND NEXT PAGE WE BREAK OUTS THE- SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSALS INTO THREE GROUPINGS. SO ON THIS TABLE HERE- WILL START COVERING I WILL START WITH THE PROPOSED BASED FUNDING CHANGES AND THIS INCLUDES TWO PROPOSALS WHICH FINANCES ALREADY EXPLAINED- IN TERMS OF THEM. THE LAST PAGE THAT'S OKAY I'M JUST SLOW APPROACH. AND THIS IS THE YEAH THIS IS JUST A MEATY PART I THINK WE'RE COUNTY RIGHT NOW- SO IN TERMS OF THAT BASE FUNDING INCREASES THIS WOULD RISE GREAT RAISE RATES FOR A MOST SELF AS TO SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT WE% FIND THIS PROPOSAL TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF EIGHTY SIX OH TWO BY ELIMINATING. RATHER ARBITRARY DIFFERENCES IN BASE RATES AND WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE PROPOSED I'M GOING BASS AUGMENTATION. SECOND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE AND STUDENT ATTENDANCE WE RECOMMEND ALSO ADOPTING THIS PROPOSAL AS IT WOULD SMOOTH THE FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS WITH DECLINING ENROLLMENT WHICH IS THE CASE FOR MOST DISTRICTS IN THE STATE WE DO HAVE A NOTE THAT GROWING DISTRICTS MEETS THE SMALLER ANNUAL INCREASES RELATIVE TO THEIR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. AS FAR AS FINANCING REFORM GOES MORE GENERALLY WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW THE CHALLENGES THAT MINISTRATION CITED REALLY. RELATE BACK TO THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING MODEL ITSELF WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX OF TO PROVIDE SCHOOLS WITH THE NECESSARY FRY FLEXIBILITY TO. FIND FUNDING IN WAYS THAT ALIGN WITH STUDENT NEEDS AND THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE PROMOTE INCLUSIVE PRACTICES. AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STUDENT SERVICES. AND WE THINK THAT MENSURATION HAS YET TO RIDICULOUS HOW THE CURRENT FUNNY MONEY MODEL CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROBLEM CITED. MAKING IDENTIFYING WE ARE THOSE ISSUES ARE ACTUALLY REALLY HELPFUL IN TERMS OF GUIDING QUITE FUTURE FUNDING REFORM LOOKS LIKE. MOVING ON TO THAT SECOND ROLE IN THE TABLE. WE DISCUSS THAT STUDIES IN THE WORK GROUPS ARE ALSO IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PROVIDES FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE TIME FOR STUDY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS A COMBINED SIX HUNDRED MEN THOUSAND ONE TIME TO CONVENE TO BURKE GROUPS. HERE WE ARE ENCOURAGED LEGISLATURE TO VIEW THESE PROPOSALS AS OPPORTUNITIES TO WEIGH AND INFORM FUTURE PHASES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION REFORM. THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE PRIOR THESE AREAS ALIGNED WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THAT'S FAIR BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS OTHER PRIORITIES IN MAY CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT STUDIES OR WORKGROUPS WOULD BE HELPFUL IN PURSUING THOSE OTHER PRIORITIES. SO FOR INSTANCE MANY DISTRICTS ARE SEEN INCREASES AND THEIR LOCAL EDUCATION COSTS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER FUNNY STUDY THAT WOULD HELP I CAN'T AFFORD THE COST PROVIDE SOME. IF UNDER THE CURRENT ABC TOMORROW. COULD YOU PLEASE JUST LATER COULD DIRECT I OTHER I PRIORITY MORE DIRECTLY SUCH AS- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER X. EGGS. IN TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DISTRICTS IMPLEMENTING INCLUSIVE PRACTICES. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME FOR PRESCHOOL AS DESCRIBED IN THAT LAST ROOM THE TABLE. THIS FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED IN THE SAME- AS THAT NINETEEN TWENTY PRESCHOOL FINING WISE BY HEAD COUNT OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AND ADISTRICT. ON AND AS FINANCES MENTIONED IN CONTRAST TO THE NINETEEN TWENTY. FUNDING THIS FUNDING IS INTENDED TO INCREASE OUR IMPROVE PROGRAM SERVICE SAYS. AND SO ARE OUR CONCERNS VERY MUCH A ONE TWO YEARS SENATOR ROSS WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE INTENTION IS WITH ONE TIME FINDING. TO IT AT IMPROVE IMPROVE OR INCREASE PROGRAM SERVICES AND WE THINK EXPECTING DISTRICTS TO DO SUCH FRIENDS ARE RATHER CONFUSING MESSAGES MESSAGE. DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO PROVIDE MORE SERVICES WITH ONE TIME FUNDING NOR THE LIKELY TO INCREASE SPENDING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION. SERVICES AS- INTO THE SLOT FUNDING AND FUTURE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. THE WE READ. THE LEGISLATURE SAD YOU THAT TO PROPOSE TWO HUNDRED OF MILLION INTO AN ON GOING BASIS AUGMENTATION AND SETTING USE THIS TO FIND INCLUDE A PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN INTO THE BASE FORMULA. THE STATE DOES NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS TO SERVICE AGE GROUP DESPITE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT DISTRICTS STARTS TO PROVIDING SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES STARTING AND CAL TO THIRD BIRTHDAY. WE BELIEVE THAT EXPANDING THE BASE FORMULA TO INCLUDE PRE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE LOCAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SERVING THIS AGE GROUP. WE ALSO WE WOULD RECOMMEND MODIFYING THE BASE FORMULATO DOUBLE COUNT FOR KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE AS AN APPROPRIATE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD METRIC THE PROXY FOR PRE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMENTS BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS SO WE HAVE FROM IF WE WERE INTERESTED IN SWIMMING. WE WERE ABLE TO REALLOCATE MONEY TO DO THIS. IF WE WERE INTERESTED IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE- INCREASE IN THE INCIDENCE OF MORE SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENTS IN THE MODERATE. TO SEVERELY DISABLED CATEGORY. AND THE COST INCREASED COST OF EDUCATING THOSE STUDENTS TO BE ANY IMPEDIMENT TO. US FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL MONEY OUT TO THROUGH THE SELFLESS TO THE DISTRICTS FOR THAT PURPOSE ON TOP OF THE BASE RATE. I THINK IT WOULD JUST BE A FIX OUT AWAY TO MOST APPROPRIATE ALLOCATE THAT MNEY I THINK THERE ARE VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO THAT- BUT I THINK THERE ARE SOME MAIN GUIDING PRINCIPLES THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE IN MIND. FIRST IS HOW CHANGES TO AB SIX OH TWO YOU WOULD CHANGE INCENTIVES OVER IDENTIFIER POTENTIALLY OVER SERVE STUDENTS- IF WE DO FLOW ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO DISTRICTS AND FELL BUT AS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THIS CHANGES BEHAVIOR IN A WAY THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY INTEND TO AS A STATE. ONLY HAS A QUESTION- I'M UP I UNDERSTAND I THINK I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND. THE CONCEPT IN THE IMPACT OF THE CONCEPT IN THE CURRENT SITUATION WHERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING AN EXTRA. IS IT 40% OR SIXTY PERCENT. OF THE GENERAL FUND TO FUND SPECIAL EDUCATION ANYWAY SO. OUR OUR AREN'T THEY GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND THE MONEY ANYWAY AND- CAN I MAKING SENSE SO I JUST GIVE THEM AN EXTRA. FIFTY DOLLARS A ON IF IT'S DONE ON AN EIGHTY A BASIS OR A STUN ON AN EIGHTY A BASIS EIGHTY EIGHT. IN TERMS OF MODERATE TO SEVERELY DISABLED STUDENT IF WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT SO IS MY QUESTION MAKE SENSE HOW DOES IT REALLY MAKES HOW DOES THAT. CONCERN MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE ENVIRONMENT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WHERE IT'S NOT A 100% FUNDED ANYWAY. SURE CITING THE QUESTION THEN IS HOW YOU OUT HOW YOU ALLOCATE THAT MONEY RIGHT SO FOR INSTANCE IF YOU HAVE. MORE MONEY THAT IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED FOR A STUDENT WITH FOR INSTANCE AUTISM. AND YOU MADE IT IT MIGHT YOU MIGHT AND SEE ADDITIONAL MONEY COMING FROM THE STATE IF YOU HAVE EIGHT CHILD'S THAT IS CLASSIFIED IT WITH AN AUTISM. ON DISABILITY THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WALL FROM A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE DEAL YOU THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL A DIAGNOSTIC DIE DIAGNOSES AND IDENTIFICATION OF THESE RATE. HAS THIS BUT THEN COME WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO I THINK IT IS THAT A BAD THING SO I THINK THAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION TO ASK- BUT I WOULD SAY FIRST THAT IN TERMS OF THE RESEARCH THERE HAVE BEEN VERY STUDIES LOOKING AT STATES AND HOW WHEN THEY TRANSITION OVER TO. A MODEL THAT IS WHAT WE CALL CONSENSUS SPACE WHICH IS WHAT AB SIXTY TWO IS IT DOESN'T TIED NECESSARILY TO A DIRECT MEASURE OF COSTA JUST OVERALL STUDENT COUNTY HAVE. OVERLY OVERLAY I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YES EXACTLY HEARINGS THE DISMANTLING ABC TO EXACTLY- I AND ENERGY STANDING THERE AND- BUT AND- SORRY WE DO SEE IT FROM OTHER STATES THAT. CHANGING THE FUNDING MECHANISM DOES CHANGE BEHAVIOR I THINK IS A QUITE A I WANT TO MENTION- DISPERSED BUT SECOND AND- IT'S- I BECAUSE THIS IS MORE OF AN ART THAN A SCIENCE YES IT DEFINITELY AS YOU SAY JOHN HAS IS ARTISTIC AND AT A CERTAIN LEVEL YEAH I HAVE TO TAKE WHAT YOU SAY IS GOSPEL BECAUSE IT'S ART AND SCIENCE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT WE'RE MORE JOHN IS ON THE SCALE AND YES EXACTLY AND SO WE I THINK WE ARE JUST VERY COGNIZANT THAT THOSE MIGHT BE MORE PRESENT IN THE ROOM WHEN THOSE CLASSIFICATIONS ARE BEING MADE THEN THEY OUGHT TO BE BECAUSE THERE IS ADDITIONAL MONEY TIED TO A CERTAIN CLASSIFICATION. AND THAT IS OUR MAJOR CONCERN WELL I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS BECAUSE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN OVERVIEW BUT I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME AMIDST THIS MONKS DOES- PERHAPS MAYBE THAT WANT TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AS WE MEET ME MOVE FORWARD. AND THISIF. IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION ARENA- I WILL MENTION THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE MECHANISMS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT AN OFFICE THAT WOULD KIND OF AVOID DISINCENTIVE ISSUES. POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT HIGH A HIGH COST RISK POOLS AND WHERE IT WORKS ALMOST LIKE AN INSURANCE MECHANISM. AND THAT THE DISTRICT WOULD HAVE TO SPEND A FAIR AMOUNT BEFORE IT GETS QUALIFIES FOR PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT TO THIS FROM THE STATE OR LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY PROXY MEASURES DO NOT DIRECTLY- FOCUSING AND FUNDING BASED ON STUDENTS WITH MILD OR SEVERE DISABILITIES. LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF MORE CHALLENGING THE GAME AND SO I THINK THOSE ARE CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS DO YOU DO YOU PLAN ON. PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THAT SORT OF DETAILS SOME OF THESE OPTIONS FOR US. I AM I THINK IT IS GIVEN THE TIME LINE IT'S MOST LIKELY THROUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH. YOUR OFFICE HAS GOT TO BE SUFFICIENT- BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO. IF YOU'RE HAVING THE PRODUCT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR DELIBERATIONS HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. MA'AM KRISTIN I CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- I THINK JUST A DOVE TAIL ON THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE HAVING- WITH LA- IS THAT THAT IT'S A IT'S ALSO AN AREA OF INTEREST AROUND THIS IDEA OF HOW KIDS ARE IDENTIFIED AND WHAT CLASS OF WHAT CAN'T DISABILITY CATEGORY THERE IDENTIFIED UNDER BECAUSE NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE AROUND PERCEIVED FUNDING AN ACTUAL FUNDING COSTS BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED OUTCOMES AND SO IT'S AN AREA THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT- AND THAT WE LOOK AT AROUND DISPROPORTIONATELY WHEN YOU HAVE. CERTAIN MINORITY STUDENT WORKS- THAT ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN DIFFERENT DISABILITY TYPES SO THERE'S A LOT OF- THERE'S A LOT UNDERNEATH THIS I THINK THE FUNDING STUDY- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT SO THAT BEING COMMISSIONED IS GOING TO BE LOOKING AT- THESE HOW THESE PLAY OUT AND I THINK THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THE STUDY OF JUSTIN AND STUDY OF ANOTHER STATE TO REALLY LOOK THOSE FORMULATIONS AND TO TRY TO AND ASK SOME OF THAT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE PERMISSION TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS. SO REALLY LOOKING FORWARD AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT. IN A SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON LABELS WHAT WE'RE REALLY AFTER IS TO TRY TO GET STUDENTS WHAT THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT AND THAT- THE MORE LABELS WERE PUTTING ON STUDENTS. THE LESS YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT ACROSS ALL OF OURS SORT OF INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS EVEN CROSSED DEPARTMENTS WELL WE DO A LOT OF STUDIES ARE YES HE HAS AND- I'M NOT SURE THAT WE- DO MUCH WITH THE STUDIES THAT WE- COMMISSION. A WOULD BE ONE THING TO ME IF ALL THE PLACES ON THE CHESS BOARD WERE FULL ON WERE SIMPLY MOVING PIECES AROUND BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH A CHESS BOARD IT'S GOT HALF THE PIECES ON IT AND DISTRICTS ARE HAVING TO TAKE THIS MONEY OUT OF SOME PLACE AND SO I YOU KNOW I'M IN FAVOR OF MOVING. FORWARD RATHER THAN NECESSARILY WAITING FOR STUDIES WE'RE DEALING WITH PROFESSIONALS IN THE EDUCATION ARENA AND YOU WOULD. I WOULD CERTAINLY HOPE THAT. PROFESSIONALS MAKE THE DECISIONS THEY MAKE FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AND NOT SIMPLY TO. PUT A FEW MORE DOLLARS INTO THE GENERAL FUND ACCOUNT TO DO WITH WHATEVER. AND I'M I'M LEARNING THAT YOU KNOW YOU. THERE ARE VARIATIONS AND APPARENTLY NOT EVERYTHING IS CERTAIN AND FIXED IN THE AREA OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND- IN THE IN THE CLASSIFICATIONS IN THE CATEGORIES AND HOW WE- ALLOCATE MONEY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE NEED TO TRY TO DRIVE MORE MONEY DOWN. TO ADDRESS- I NEED SO THAT WE IN THE DEBT THE DISTRICT LEVEL AND IN THE CLASSROOM WE TAKE CARE OF. US SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS IN OUR STATE. AND OF COURSE WE'RE EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT SO YES PLEASE I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND HOPEFULLY YOU'RE GOING TO JOIN IN THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LA- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION AND- WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FORWARD HERE- IN A SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE PIPELINE. MAY I ADD ONE MORE THING JUST ROOM- THAT IS THAT. THAT THE SIGNALS THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THANK YOU TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND FINANCE FOR RECOGNIZING ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE THAT HAD. BEEN COMMISSION AND A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WERE. RECOMMENDED IN THAT CAME ABOUT THROUGH RESEARCH- HAVE ARE BEING ADDRESSED IN AND- I WOULD SAY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IS COMPLEX THAT ARE. EACH AND- EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR INTO INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS ARE OUR SYSTEM. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENT IS VERY COMPLEX AND SO. THIS SORT OF MULTIFACETED APPROACH TO TRYING TO. FIX THE SYSTEM IF YOU WILL- IS ACTUALLY. WHAT WE SEE IS THE RIGHT APPROACH ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE TEACHER ASPECT AND I THINK I JUST WANNA IT SORT OF IN THIS PIECE WITH SAYING THAT- IN ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH DISTRICTS. AND WHAT WE HEAR WE'RE TRYING TO. IMPROVE OUR PROCESSES WITH THEM AS THEIR MORE MATURE THAN THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDER. IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE VERY FIRST TEACHING AND WHETHER OR NOT AS A STATE WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE. A FUNDAMENTAL SYSTEM OF UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING IN EVERY CLASSROOM AND REALLY SETTING THAT STANDARD FOR. THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION CAN BE BUILT. AS A SUPPLEMENT NOT SUPPLANTING EDUCATION. SO WHAT WE'RE AFTER IS SUPPORT THE- AND THE PARENT EDUCATOR AND THE FAMILY. SO THAT EVERYONE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND THEN. EDUCATE CAN COME IN A SORT OF. IT ACT EXPERTISE THE NEW. A FEW WELL WHO WILL HELP TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. KNOWLEDGE IN. TO LIVE ANY FOR THE QUESTION. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO HAVE DONE AND CONTINUE TO DO IN THIS- VERY VERY IMPORTANT- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU. SO BRIDGES. THIS. NEXT ITEM ISSUE NUMBER THREE PERSPECTIVES ON SPECIAL EDUCATION CHALLENGES. THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING IN THAT RUNNING AWAY YES MA'AM WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD PLEASE. DIRECTOR OR CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR THE CALVARY COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN PARTICULAR MY WORK IS IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH SOME COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING INSTRUCTIONAL ISSUES THANK YOU FOR JOINING US OKAY WHO WANTS 2% INTERESTING OKAY. COMING AROUND TO YOU NOW IS A COUPLE PIECES OF INFORMATION- TO SORT OF LAY A FOUNDATION IN TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IT FOCUSING ON COLLECTIVELY AND WHEN I SAY COLLECTIVELY I MEAN THIS IS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH IN THE STATE AROUND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES AROUND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME STANDING ISSUE FOR US SO IF YOU LOOK AT AND IF YOU HAVE IT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST- SORT OF SLIDE YOU'LL SEE SOME SOME. LINES COLOR LINES AND THE FIRST THAT OUR- OF OUR STUDENTS WITHOUT DISABILITIES. AND THE DOTTED SAID OUR OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND BASICALLY IT'S SHOWING THE ACHIEVEMENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS. WHO ARE IN DIFFERENT. ETHNIC GROUPS WHO DO OR DO NOT HAVE DISABILITY SO ALL POINT YOU TO- WHAT WE SEE IS IN THE STRAIGHT LINES IS OR THE FILLED OUT LINES THAT ARE NOT DOT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THAT. IS THAT THERE IS THAT THAT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. OF THAT WE SEE BETWEEN- GROUPS IF YOU LOOK DOWN TO THE DOTTED LINES THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO THIS IS THIS IS OUR STUDENTS- WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES AGAIN. AND OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. OVERALL YOU'LL SEE THAT- THAT THE DOTTED LINE IN YELLOW IS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE GAP THAT YOU'RE SEEING BETWEEN THEM. AND SOME OF THEIR COUNTERPARTS- WITHOUT DISABILITIES AND I BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION AND ALSO TO THE TO LOOK AT THE FOLLOWING SLIDE BELOW IT. WHICH SHOWS WHERE STUDENTS ARE SPENDING THEIR TIME. AND SO AS A STATE WE RANK- IN THE- THE LAST QUARTILE UP OR THE LOWEST QUARTILE AROUND ACCESS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES TO THE GENERAL AT CLASSROOM. AND ONE OF THE GOALS UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT. IS FOR STUDENTS TO SPEND THE MAJORITY OF THEIR TIME WITH THEIR GENERAL APPEARS RECEIVING GREAT FIRST INSTRUCTION. AND SO AS A STATE WERE ABOUT AT 56% OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES SPENDING BE PERCENT OR MORE OF THEIR TIME IN GENERAL EDUCATION. AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT- TO BE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AND WE JUST- CONVENED A STAKEHOLDER GROUP WHICH WHERE IS UNDER OUR REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE FEDERAL ACT- WHO BASICALLY- SAID THAT THEY WOULD LIKE US TO SEE. TE CS GO UP ALMOST TWENTY PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AROUND ACCESS. TO THAT GENERAL EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT. SO I BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE WE OUTCOMES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO READ AND COMMUNICATE AND EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND- GET ACCESS TO THE GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS. SO THAT. A LOT OF THE DEEP WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA CLAPPER FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AS WELL AS OUR COUNTY OFFICES AND DISTRICTS IS AROUND HOW DO WE GIVE KIDS MORE. TIME WITH THAT GREAT FIRST TEACHER IN THEIR GENERAL AYE CLASSROOM WITH THEIR PEERS. AND IN THAT HOW DO WE HAVE HOW WILL WE MAKE SURE TO INCREASE THEIR READING- AND COMMUNICATION PROFICIENCY LEVELS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA TO MOVE ON. WELL BY THE WAY HOW WOULD GRADE WOULD YOU GIVE THIS IF YOU. GRADING I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THE TOP CHART. AND WHILE THE SCALE MAY BE. DECEPTIVE YOU KNOW IF YOU. IT IT IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A FLAT LINE EVEN THOUGH IT REALLY ISN'T IN IN ALL LEVELS YEAH. AND N. AS TO THE- AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE ISSUE I MEAN THIS IS AN AREA WHERE- CELL PRISON AND ELEAZAR YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE. RIGHT WHETHER YOU TAKE IT WHETHER WE FUNDED ARE THE FEDS FUND IS RIGHT FOR YOU FUNDED OUT OF YOUR- GENERAL FUND SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A MONEY I MEAN IT'S A MONEY ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE COST OF THE- HIT. THE GENERAL FUND FOR THESE DISTRICTS. BUT THE MONEY. HAS TO BE THERE FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED THE SERVICES RIGHT SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE MONEY'S THERE AND IT'S NOT A MONEY FUNDING ISSUE. HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THE FOR A- FOR THE DIFFERENCE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT STATISTIC. AND HOW ARE WE TO PORT AND HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR THE FAILURE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BETWEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN AND- EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IN THE PROFICIENCY AREA. THE CENTER FOR QUESTION IT IS IT IS A QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S A QUESTION THAT ARE THAT THAT'S SORT OF THE ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH IS- FIRST WE HAVE TO HAVE A- GREAT FIRST TEACHING WITH YOU KNOW AND GIVE OUR EDUCATORS THE KIND OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO DO THEIR BEST WORK. AND BUT I THINK WE WOULD ARGUE THAT IT'S HARD TO IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT KIDS WITH DISABILITIES CAN GET ACCESS TO THAT IF THEY'RE NOT THERE. IF THEY'RE IN SEPARATE SETTINGS- AND NOT WITH THEIR GENERAL APPEARS BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE MAPPING TO HEAR IS EMPLOYMENT AND COMMUNITY INCLUSION BELONGING FOR EVERY SINGLE STUDENT OUR STATE AND WHAT WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE FOR AND FOR NOT MAINSTREAMING AS OPPOSED. SOBRE DAY SO EACH OF THOSE. EACH OF THE EACH OF THIS IS A COMPILATION OF INDIVIDUAL STUDENT. YOU KNOW EDUCATION PROGRAMS RIGHT SO THIS IS THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENT ENTITLEMENT. SO EVERY THE PERFORMANCE ISSUE SOMEWHERE DOWN IN THEBOWELS OF THE DEATH OF THE DISTRICTS INVOLVED. AS OPPOSED TO THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCE. I THINK IT'S BOTH I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS RIGHT SO IF YOU IF OUR STUDENTS. FIRST OF ALL NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND- THEN THAT'S GONNA THAT TAKES A LEVEL OF SUPPORT. FOR THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM- IT ALSO IT TOUCHES ON SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS ALL THE WAY FROM TRAINING AND SO YOU KNOW WE CAN PUT WE CAN PULL OUT THE IDEA AROUND- SPECIAL A TEACHER SHORTAGE. AND HAVING A SEASON TEACHER- ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS RIGHT WE MAY HAVE. TEACHERS IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OR TEACHERS ON SO THEY'RE SPENDING THE MONEY IT'S JUST THEY'RE NOT RIGHT IT WILL TO SPEND THE MONEY ON THE TOOLS THE MOST AFFECTED. SO THE QUESTION IS AND THIS IS WHAT WE GRAPPLE WITH ALL THE TIME IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU BUILD UP CAPACITY IN THE STATE I THINK IT CAME UP EARLIER AROUND THE- THE CONTRACTING IN THAT. YOU ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT CONTRACTING. WE DO HAVE TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY IN OUR SCHOOLS FOR THEM WE THEY NEED ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN. A SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO CONTRACT OUT BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE ANYWAY. RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL ENTITLEMENT BE SUED. THE SPENDING THE MONEY THE QUESTION IS ARE THEY SPENDING THE MONEY IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY I GUESS AND AS OF ARE YOU RIGHT AND SO WE WANT THEM TO GET IN THE CYCLE WHERE THEY'RE BUILDING THEIR OWN DISTRICT CAPACITY THAT'S A LOT OF THE WORK THE CARLA AS TO- AROUND. BEING ABLE TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF ONE WELL SUPPORTED CLASSROOMS AND WELL SUPPORTED ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE HIGHLY TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR TEACHERS TO DO THEIR BEST WORK AND FOR. AND SO PART OF THIS IS IT'S A MINDSET AND MENTAL MODEL PROBLEM THAT WE'VE CLASSICALLY HAD STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES EXCLUDED. SO PART OF THIS IS. YOU KNOW. AN ACCEPTANCE WHERE WE WANT TO INCLUDE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BECAUSE IT'S THERE YOU KNOW IT'S THEIR RIGHT AS PEOPLE TO BE INCLUDED. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT TRACKS DIRECTLY IF YOU START OFF IN AN% AS IN A SEGREGATED BETTING IN PRESCHOOL YOU TYPICALLY END IN THE SEGREGATED SETTING IN SCHOOL OFTEN DON'T RECEIVE HER HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. SO FOR BACKWARD MAPPING FROM WHAT WE WANT FOR OUR STUDENTS WERE WE WANT THEM TO START FROM THE BEGINNING TO KNOW THAT THEY BELONG AND THEN TO BUILD IN ALL THOSE LEVELS OF SUPPORT THE FOR SOME STUDENTS THAT'S A LOT OF SUPPORT. YOU KNOW FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT MAY MEAN. SHE NEEDS FULL TIME. WORKING ALL THE TIME TO INCLUDE HER IN THAT CLASSROOM MAYBE EVEN MORE THAN ONE PERSON. BUT THAT WOULD BE THE MORE SIGNIFICANT END OF THE SPECTRUM AND WE GET THERE. SO IT MAY NOT IS THIS HOW DOES THIS SURE HOW DOES THIS. THAT IS HOW DO WE GET THERE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT INCREASED FUNDING- IN PARTICULAR AREAS. RELIEVING IN THEIR SPENDING THIS THE BOTTOM OF THEIR PRESUMABLY SPENDING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY NEED TO SPEND OR THEY WOULD BE SUED. ON SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE IS A REQUIREMENT TO DO SO AND YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE PROBABLY IN LITIGATION SOME DISTRICT BUNCH OF. AND WE CAN REARRANGE THE MONEY TO TRY TO GET IT TO THE HIGH COST AREAS AND SHOULD. BUT WITHIN THAT ENVIRONMENT WHATEVER THE MONEY IS HOPEFULLY IT'S ENOUGH HOW DO WE IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL. WHAT'S THE PROCESS TO DO THAT. I MEAN DO WE SEND OUT TEAMS OF INSPECTORS AND SAY TO THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE PRINCIPLE. NO NO NO HI SO HOW DO WE DO IT IF AND FRANKLY JUST GIVE UP I DON'T MEAN TO NO I THINK THE I THE RIGHT CUT IS THAT IS THAT IT BUT IT IS A COMBINATION OF MANY ISSUES AND ONE OF THEM IS A FUNDING ISSUE AND SO FOR IF WE WANT THE IF WE WANT TO. DISTRICTS BE ABLE TO BUILD UP ALL THEIR- FUNDAMENTAL HERE ONE BEST FIRST INSTRUCTION AND THE MANDATE IS ON MAKING SURE TO PROVIDE ALL THE RELATED SERVICES IN THERE AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY THERE THAN THAT. MANDATE IT COMES TO THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOR THOSE SERVICES BECAUSE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS REQUIRED AND YOU'RE RIGHT THEY WILL BE LITIGATED BUT I THINK CARL CAN SPEAK TO. MAKE IT TO THE FUNDING ISSUE BECAUSE I'M SO FASCINATED BY IT SO EVEN IF WE PROVIDE AN OVERLAY TO THE V. SIX A TWO FOUR FORMULA FOR THE MODERN SEVERELY DISABLED. STUDENTS IN WEEKS HELLO THAT DOWN THE PIPELINE TO THE SUBURBS IN THE ALLEYS. IT COSTS MUCH ANYWAY THE DEAD RELEASE PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL FUND RIGHT. SO THEY ARE GETTING MORE MONEY FROM US PRESUMABLY THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE AS MUCH OF THE GENERAL FUND. TO COVER THE COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THE DISTRICTS. ARE WE ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE GONNA. TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE. THE OBLIGATION THAT WE HAVE SOMEWHAT RELIEVED THEM FROM IN TERMS OF THERE'S GENERAL FUND. AND THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT GENERAL FUND MONEY MOVING TOWARDS SPECIAL ED. I THINK WE'RE MAKING THE ASSUMPTION THOUGH THAT THE FOUNDATION AROUND UNIVERSAL EDUCATION FOR ALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT JUST STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BUTTRESSING OVER ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN LA AND MATHEMATICS ARE AREAS THAT WE HAVE GREAT IMPROVEMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO I DO THINK THINK ABOUT HOW WE FIND JUST ENSURING THAT THE GOOD FIRST TEACHING. IS OCCURRING IN EVERY CLASSROOM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SOMETHING THAT AROUND PER PEOPLE FUNDING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. WHAT WOULD THAT TAKE WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE- BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN LOOK AT SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING AND SERVICES. OKAY THEN WHAT THESE. SELECT FOR OUR STUDENTS WITH. HOW DO YOU IT WAS THAT HOW IN SAN. THAT WITHIN THE SUBURB WITHIN THE ELLIE A FOR EXAMPLE. IN MY EXPERIENCE ARE FINDING AS WE WORK AND PROVIDING DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AS THE AS THE DISTRICT- AND PLAY FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT I'M FINDING IS THAT FOLKS IN MANY SITUATIONS DO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE AREAS WHERE THE STRUGGLES BEGAN WINDING IS HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO BUILD A CONSENSUS ABOUT LOCAL LEVEL ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EDUCATING ALL KIDS. EACH COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN VIEW AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO HOW DO YOU WORK WITH PEOPLE TO CREATE GOOD STRONG PLANS OF ACTIONS WITH SOME BENCHMARKS. KNOWING THAT THAT WORKS WILL NOT WORKING AND BEING ABLE TO COURSE CORRECT IT'S SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO. THE NEXT PIECE THOUGH AND THE REPORTING OUT TO PUBLIC. BECAUSE PUBLIC HEALTH CAP FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT WE KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE REALLY DRIVING THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITHIN THE DISTRICT. BUT DISTRICTS STILL ARE REALLY TRYING TO BE REFLECTIVE OF HOW TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT JURY STILL OUT ON WHETHER THAT WORKS OR IS THIS PART OF THE DASHBOARD FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN YOU CAN BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE DASHBOARD DATA IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT. BUT IN THIS AREA SO YEAH HE'LL ACTUALLY 57% OF OUR DISTRICTS THAT ARE- QUALIFY FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. UNDER THE DASHBOARD FOR THEIR WHAT THEIR DATA IS TELLING US IS FOR THE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. GROUP SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING IT IS THIS THERE'S ALL NAMES ON. EFFORT THERE IS A DEEP CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT GOOD FIRST INSTRUCTION AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS. AFTER BECAUSE TECHNICALLY EVERY STUDENT AS A GENERAL AT STUDENT THERE'S NOT SPECIAL ED STUDENTS IN GENERAL ITS STUDENTS THEIR STUDENTS THAT ARE THEIR STUDENTS THEN THEIR STUDENTS WHO ALSO RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND SO WE THAT'S THE PIECE THAT WERE REALLY TRYING TO. MEMORIALIZE OF YELLOW I WAS THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT IS ALSO THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS TO WELL TO SUPPORT ON THE GROUND. SO IN THE CLASSROOM THE STUDENTS YEAR EVERY YEAR EVERY DAY THEIR CONSTANT. IN THE SYSTEM IT'S A NEAT. GILLES BILL TO PRESS. CONTEMPLATING SO THE TYPES OF THE ARTS AVAIL OKAY. AT FROM. THE CLOSEST SINCE STATE WHY TECHNO SYSTEMS ALSO A LOCAL LAW. IS SOMETHING THAT CAN NEEDS BE ABLE TO GROW AND CHANGE BECAUSE THAT KIND OF COACHING AND IMPLEMENTATION. IS REALLY WHAT DRIVES THE CHANGE IT'S WHAT TEACHERS AND FEEL LIKE I HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS I CAN DO THIS WHAT ARE THE SUPPORT SENATE DISTRICT NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF IN UNDERSTAND THAT. SHIFTING NEEDS NEED ALSO THEM TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT. THOSE KIND THAT KIND OF SUPPORT TO KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. IS NOT AN EASY THING TO BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT. I THINK ONE OF THINGS I SEE IT ON IS AROUND LIKE CREEK BEING ABLE TO CREATE CONTINUUM'S OF SUPPORT THROUGH MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS- BEHAVIOR IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD A CULTURE AND CLIMATE AT A SCHOOL THAT REALLY FEELS WELCOMING AND SAFE. AND AT THE SAME TIME BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. HOW DOES ONE SCHOOL BE ABLE TO OFFER THAT HOW DOES ONE DISTRICT BILL THAT- THIS IS WHY SOMETIMES I'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE COSTS. AROUND THESE KINDS OF CONTINUUM'S OF SUPPORT. OF BECOME QUIT THEIR PRIMARY BIG IN THE REASON WHY THE PEOPLE REALLY FEELING IT AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL IS BECAUSE- BEING ABLE TO BUILD THAT KIND OF CONTINUING CANNOT JUST BE ON ONE END OF. INDIVIDUALIZED SUPPORT IT ALSO HAS TO BE PROACTIVE IT ALSO HAS TO BE FOR THE MANY KIDS WALKING TO THE GATE OF THE SCHOOL THAT THEY'RE FEELING THAT. TEACHERS YOU KNOW AND THEN- SUPPORT STAFF AS WELL AS PRINCIPLES ARE ABLE TO REALLY WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THESE KIDS ARE READY TO GO FROM THE MINUTE THEY WALK INTO THE SCHOOL AND- REALLY MOVE OUTSIDE THE- THIS. I WILL HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON TODAY WHICH IS THE SILO AND AT LEAST IN PART. THE SILO INVOLVING SOCIAL CATION FUNDING YOU MOVE INTO. FOR AND GENERALLY. A LIST THE CASE TWELVE EDUCATE WHETHER. THE MEANT. FOR THE LAST. GEN FIVE SUN THE YOU LOOK AT THE- IF THE SECOND. GROW OF THE SECOND GRAPH. REALLY WHAT THAT'S US IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE TO ABOUT WHICH IS R. C. WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT JUST USE WHICH IS A FOR THEY EARNED DOLLARS AS GENERAL AS STUDENTS RIGHT WE'RE NOT JUST- SAYING THERE SOON WITH THIS BUILDING AND CHARGING EVERYTHING AGAIN SPECIAL ED RIGHT. GET THAT THEY REALLY ARE ENTITLED TO THOSE AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A HIGHER NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES REPRESENTED IN OUR FOSTER YOUTH- IT WITH OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS AND ALSO WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE RECEIVE FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS. SO OVERALL MORE 70% OF OUR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE IN ONE OR MORE OF THOSE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA STUDENT GROUPS AS WELL. MEANING THAT THIS IS ALL SO INTERCONNECTED AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING SPECIAL LOWER YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT AN ALL HANDS ON DECK EFFORT ABOUT. WHAT WE BELIEVE IN KIDS- THAT IT'S EACH AND EVERY KID AND THAT WERE REALLY THE- DISTRICT THAT WERE WORKING WITH THAT WE'VE SEEN. SO MUCH IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME- WITH GENERATION RATES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND OTHER THINGS ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE INTENTIONALLY BACKWARD MAPPED. TO PRESCHOOL. AND STARTED WITH A SHIFT IN MINDSET AND MENTAL MODELS ABOUT WHAT THEY BELIEVE ABOUT ALL KIDS. AND THAT STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ARE NOT. KIDS WHO CAN'T LEARN SINCE THE DISABILITIES ARE KIDS WITH UNIQUE LEARNING NEEDS THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT. THE SYSTEM AND SO PART OF THAT IT INTO CARLOS WHEN IT'S WE'RE JUST WE'RE JUST. SEEING THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE A LOT OF SUPPORT AND SO ALL THESE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE STATEWIDE IN IT AND THE SHOULD HAVES AND THE BUDGET PROPOSALS. ALL SPEAK TO PIECES OF THAT SO IT'S JUST LIKE REALLY COMPLICATED PUZZLE. THAT WE ARE STARTING TO I THINK IT HAS THE MOMENTUM ON BUT WE NEED TO KEEP. DOING OKAY YEAH. I AND GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THOSE CLASSROOMS I THINK WHAT I'M FINDING ARE ARE THINGS LIKE WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT WE START TO IDENTIFY SOME CONTENT LEADS AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION AREAS. OF REAL NEED THAT AS AS PRESENT AS HIGHLIGHTED PERFORMANCE INDICATORS ISSUE A WEEK WE'VE GOT WORK TO DO. AND SO WE HAVE AREAS LIKE ENGLISH LEARNERS THAT ARE ALSO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES LOOKING AT ISSUES OF DISPROPORTIONATE ALLEN HERE WE OVER IDENTIFYING ARE UNDER IDENTIFYING CERTAIN STUDENTS. OR LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT LIKE YOU UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING- WE ARE FINDING THAT THAT TYPE OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS. LEDS DO WANT AND BUT THEY ALSO NEED EVEN DEEPER THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE FOLKS HO CAN ACTUALLY COME TO THEIR- SCHOOL BE ABLE TO. COME OUT TO THEIR DISTRICT AND PROVIDE THAT DIFFERENT TYPE OF SUPPORT AND SO OTHER FUNDING AREAS ARE LIKE YOU WE CAN SEE AS A LAY ALSO BEGIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THAT CAPACITY FROM THE ROOTS UP. AS WERE ALSO BUILDING THAT TYPE OF TECHNICAL SYSTEMS THAT FOLKS ARE JUST GONNA NEED AS THEY TRY TO IMPLEMENT THEM. I'M IMPORTANT BUT A VERY COURAGEOUS WORK THAT THE TAP. IS A BRAND TING IN THE SHIP IN. SHE WERE ABLE TO HAPPEN ON CUT IN GRANT GOT DOLLARS IN THE K. CONCENTRATION GRANT DOLLARS ARE READ THE STEW IN THIS THAT OF THE GREATER NADER THEY'RE SIMPLE ELSE AND THE HOLY ABOUT THIS BETWEEN SCHOOL A IN SCHOOL AND BECAUSE THEY PREDICT DOES HAS YOU KNOW. THE 55% OVER 55% ANSWERED CENTERS SO VERY INTERESTING AND YOU DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN. YOU'RE ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT'S NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION DOLLARS. SENDING THOSE DOWN A PIPELINE IT'S ALL OF THE OTHER EDUCATION DOLLARS THAT FLOW TO A PARTICULAR SCHOOL CAMPUS. AND WHETHER THOSE ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE SERVICES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE EDUCATION OF A STUDENT WITH SPECIAL NEEDS BUT ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED- IN THE WAYS THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT AROUND. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY- CONVICTING A WORKER RIGHT NOW FROM THE BUDGET FROM SB SEVENTY FIVE FROM WHAT. LAST BUDGET CYCLE OF AROUND. FAQ TO- MEDI CAL DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL BASED HEALTH. AND ABSENCE IS ALSO A BIG PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE STUDENTS THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THOSE GRAPHS ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT WE CAN DRAW DOWN DOLLARS FOR THE SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE. PROP SIXTY THREE MONEY AS WELL BY THE WAY YES. SO THIS ALL THIS IS SUCH AN INTERCONNECTED CONVERSATION AND WHAT WERE SENSING AND WE'RE BEEN PART OF A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS- STATE DEPARTMENTS AND FUNDING SOURCES TO BE ABLE TO MAXIMIZE. HELPING OUR STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE WHEN THEY NEED THE HELP. PERFECT YEAH. IF I MAY DECIDE LATER ANOTHER GROUP OF WORK THAT WE HAVE FOUND TO BE REALLY HELPFUL SUCH AS WORKING WITH DISTRICTS AND IT'S BEEN NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY YOUR DATA SAYING THIS. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING YOU THE RIGHT SO YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK. HAVE BEEN THINGS LIKE THAT THE PARTY INCLUDES OF PRACTICES WERE AND I WANT TO THANK THE CD E. FOR MAKING THEMSELVES ALWAYS AVAILABLE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE BEST WAY TO REALLY EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS WITH THIS PLACE TO SEE THE OUTCOMES WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR THROUGH INCLUSIONARY PRACTICES. BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S SO EASY TO JUST BE ABLE TO TURN KIßM MAKE HAPPEN. AND SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE FOLKS LIKE TEAM INCOME AT ALL AND WERE. THE DISK IN THE SCHOOL. IT ANOTHER PER EXAMPLE OF HOW WE FOLK THAT'S THE KIND OF SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO BE ABLE TO ALSO SEE. FROM THE STATE. BUT HOW DO WE- MAYBE YOU MENTIONED THE SENATE. BECAUSE I MOLD IT FLEW OVER MY HEAD BUT- HOW DO YOU. HOW DO WE THE DATA. THE BILL THAT. IN A- GOOD WAY ABOUT THE NUNS ED. IMPACT ON THE EDUCATION OF THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUS IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION IT'S A FAIR QUESTION I DO THINK ES WHAT IS I MEAN THIS IS REGARDING THAT I MEAN IT'S A RATHER GENERALIZED APPROACH. TO AND I THINK THE THING THAT WILL BE TRICKY THINGS IT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK WHAT'S TRICKY IS ALWAYS EACH PLACE IS SO DIFFERENT AND TRIES TO DEFINE THEIR PROGRAMMING IF I WAS JUST AT A DISTRICT THAT WAS THE FINING. TEACHING IN ONE WAY WHEN ACTUALLY AS THE RESEARCH AND OTHERS WOULD DEFINE IT IS NOT NECESSARY PERFECTLY ALIGNED AND SO WHERE WHERE DO YOU START TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT HOW PEOPLE DESCRIBE CERTAIN PROGRAMMING OR FRAMEWORKS THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING. MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE- BEING DESCRIBED IN THE SAME WAY SO YOU CAN MEASURE WHETHER SOMETHING IS ON THE ALLEGED CATION SIDE OF MAKING SURE ALL KIDS HAVE ACCESS IS THIS IDEA OF. UNIVERSAL EDUCATION FOR ALL OF VERSES THOSE THINGS THAT REALLY SHOULD BE UNIQUE AND SPECIALIZED TWOS YES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS SO WHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT SPECIAL EDUCATION. RIGHT ABOUT COORDINATING THEY CARE AND SERVICES WERE PROVIDING. THE WE HAVE A LOT OF ENTITIES EVEN AMONGST THOSE STUDENT GROUPS THAT YOU SAW THE OVERLAP IN WE'RE DOING AND THAT INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK AROUND FOSTER YOUTH AND THE A CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. SO MUCH OF THOSE. THOSE THE IT IS AND SERVICES TIED TOGETHER SO PART OF THIS IS THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO DO TRICKS AND COUNT READ. WORKED FOR THIS QUE THINKING WHAT AND BRING THE TWO SO EVERYONE COULD NOT- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GO WONDER ARE. AND BEHIND THAT DOOR ARE ALL OF US COORDINATING THE SERVICE FOR CHILD. SO IT'S NOT SO USING FOR PEOPLE TO YOUR OUT CAN BECAUSE THE LABEL BRING. THIS CALL. ON THE- HELP THAT. WE'RE ALL AT THE TABLE THANK BRING TO THE AS AGENTS AND FALLERS TO HELP TO SUPPORT THAT SAME WHO'S IN THE OVER BIG. CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL PER OF OURS RIGHT SO EACH IF YOU LOOK AT JUST FROM OF PERSPECTIVE OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE THE LOWEST IF YOU'RE AVERAGING YOU'RE HAVING THAT A LOT OF KIDS WHO ARE REALLY LOW THAN OUR OVERALL STATE IS IT LOWER RATE BUT THERE ARE SOME KIDS WHO EAT WHO ARE ERROR. COULD REALLY SUPPORT AND I WOULD SAY FOR SPECIAL ED WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT. CASSIDY ISSUE. A LOT OF TIMES AT THE TIME ISSUE FOR MEASUREMENT IS USUALLY VERY SPECIFIC IN TIME LIKE YOU HAVE FOUR YEARS TO DO THIS OR YOU NEED TO READ BY THIS TIME. SOMETIMES IT TAKES A LITTLE LONGER BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T HAPPEN. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THINGS PARTICULARLY AROUND THAT THE TEACHING ASPECT AND THE EARLY INTERVENTION PIECES- THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT I THINK THIS LIKE CNX ABOUT. THAT DOVETAILS INTO THE CONVERSATION WAS VERY INTERESTING CONVERSATION. HITTING US THAT'S IT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR COMING TO PARTICIPATE I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION I'LL TELL YOU THIS. HAVING DONE OTHER THINGS FOR SIX YEARS INCOMING STEPPING INTO THE EDUCATION ARENA. THE NUMBER PROGRAM IT'S NO WONDER WE HAVE DIFFICULTY COORDINATING ALL VALUABLE THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS COMING TO A PROBLEM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. MY OF TO AND EVERYONE OF YOU WORK IN THE AREA WHO CAN KEEP IT ALL STRAIGHT SO. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. INSTEAD OF.

ON THIS PROPOSAL WE ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO VIEW THIS PROPOSAL IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE OTHER PROPOSED SPECIAL EDUCATION WORK GROUPS AND STUDIES AND EVALUATE WHETHER THIS PROPOSAL MINDS WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. YES MA'AM KRISTIN RIGHT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE ARE EXCITED TO GET MOMENTUM AROUND- THIS THIS INITIATIVE AND- SPECIFICALLY IN ADDRESSING DYSLEXIA IT'S AN AREA THAT WE ADDRESS BOTH IN SPECIAL ED.

LIKE THE OTHER PUBLIC SERVANTS IN CALIFORNIA THE DEBT WE OWE SCHOOL STAFF IN RETIREMENT BENEFITS SHOULD NOT BE PAID OUT OF THE SCARES FUNDING SOURCE WE CARVE OUT FOR EDUCATION BUT FROM THE GENERAL-FUND THE STATE COLLECTS ALL CALIFORNIANS. SINCE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT HAS BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT. FOR ON PREPARING A DEVELOP TEACHER. WE IDENTIFIED. AS A STATE PRIORITY BUT WE DIDN'T FUNDED AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN IT'S CLEAR THAT DISTRICTS ALONE CANNOT CREATE AND MAINTAIN A STRONG EDUCATOR WOKFORCE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE OUR TEACHER WORKFORCE. ARE ROUTE ISSUES IN OUR OPINION TO ADDRESSING OUR OPPORTUNITY AN ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. FOR OUR LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS OF COLOR IMMIGRANT STUDENTS. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO BEAR THE BRUNT OF AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED.
