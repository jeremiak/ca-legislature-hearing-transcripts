REQUIRE VENDORS OPERATING

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:25.783
CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE API'S OR

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:26.617
APPLICATION PROGRAMMING

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:28.185
INTERFACES TO ALLOW HEALTH

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.920
SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE BROADER

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.789
PATIENT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:36.160
E. H. R. DATA. WITH THE FIRST

00:41:36.227 --> 00:41:38.062
THING THATIT IS WAS WAS

00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:39.463
DISCUSSED. WAS THAT PATIENT

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.499
ACCESS TO THEIR OWN EHR DATA IS

00:41:42.566 --> 00:41:44.702
INCREDIBLY LIMITED ESPECIALLY

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:46.070
WHEN IT COMES TO RADIOLOGY

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:48.239
SCANS PATHOLOGY IMAGES OR

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:50.507
CLINICAL NOTES. THE COMMITTEE

00:41:50.574 --> 00:41:51.709
RECOMMENDED THAT THE STATE GO

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:53.611
BEYOND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:54.645
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY CARES ACT

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:57.014
WHICH WHICH MANDATES THAT

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.449
PATIENTS DO HAVE ACCESS TO

00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:00.384
THEIR IT TO THEIR CLINICAL DATA

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.419
AND REQUIRED VENDORS TO PROVIDE

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.521
SOME OF THE MORE COMPREHENSIVE

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:07.024
DATA TO PATIENTS THROUGH THESE

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:07.591
API'S. SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:10.527
GREATER ACCESS. APR EYES OR

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.997
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:42:13.063 --> 00:42:14.932
DISCUSSED A LOT IN THE CONTEXT

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.601
OF DATA. BECAUSE MANY HELD E.

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:20.871
H. R. SYSTEMS DON'T EVEN TALK

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.773
TO EACH OTHER SO THE KEY IS FOR

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.675
THERE TO BE. INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:42:24.742 --> 00:42:27.411
SUPPORT INTER OPERABILITY. THAT

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.980
WOULD ALLOW NOT JUST PATIENTS

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:30.981
TO INTERACT WITH THE H. R.

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:33.217
BETTER BUT PATIENTS TO

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:34.919
COMMUNICATE WITH PROVIDERS AND

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:36.053
FOR FOLKS THAT ARE IN DIFFERENT

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.521
HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.790
HAVE THAT YOU CHORE COMMUNICATE

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:43.093
ACROSS ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.396
THE SECOND IS RECOMMENDATION

00:42:45.462 --> 00:42:46.897
AND AS YOU CAN SEE ALONG THE

00:42:46.964 --> 00:42:50.567
YELLOW THOSE ARE THE KEY AREAS.

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:52.703
MOST OF THESE ARE CROSS CUTTING

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.172
IN THE SENSE THAT THEY- THEY

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:57.308
ARTICULATE WITH IT SOMETIMES

00:42:57.374 --> 00:43:00.678
ONE BUT IN MOST CASES MORE THAN

00:43:00.744 --> 00:43:07.651
ONE AREA OF. DEVELOPMENT HERE.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:08.452
SO THROUGH LEGISLATION AND

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:09.053
INCENTIVES THE COMMITTEE FELT

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.587
STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:12.222
REDUCE BARRIERS FOR PATIENTS TO

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.391
OBTAIN AND SHARE THEIR DATA AND

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:16.794
CORRECT ERRORS IN THEIR EHRS.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.028
WE KNEW THAT WE KNOW THAT EACH

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:20.064
OUR DATA RIDDLED WITH ERRORS

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.365
BUT IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE THE

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.967
DATA FOR PRECISION MEDICINE THE

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.536
DATA HAVE TO BE ACCURATE SO WE

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:26.036
DON'T WANT TO CREATE A

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.604
MECHANISM BY WHICH WE START

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:30.140
GARBAGE IN GARBAGE OUT. THE

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.408
COMMITTEE FELT STRONGLY THAT

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.810
PATIENTS SHOULD BE STORED OF

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:35.813
THEIR OWN DATA CURRENTLY HEALTH

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:38.449
SYSTEMS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE

00:43:38.515 --> 00:43:39.917
THE STORE IT'S OF DATA OF

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.486
PATIENT DATA. BUT PATIENTS

00:43:42.553 --> 00:43:42.987
ACTUALLY WANT TO HAVE A

00:43:43.053 --> 00:43:45.189
MECHANISM BY WHICH TO CREATE

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:46.056
AND UPDATE THEIR OWN DATA TO

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:49.126
PREVENT ERRORS. AND THIS WAS A

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.995
TOPIC OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.930
FOR THE COMMITTEE THEY FELT

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:55.632
THAT A LOT OF PATIENTS THAT DID

00:43:55.699 --> 00:43:56.367
THE INFORMATION IN THE H. R.

00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.935
WAS INCORRECT SO IMAGINE

00:43:58.002 --> 00:43:59.770
PRESENTING TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.505
AND SOMEBODY HASN'T INCOMPLETE.

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:04.341
INCOMPLETE MEDICATION LIST OR A

00:44:04.408 --> 00:44:05.642
PHYSICIAN IS TRYING TO TREAT

00:44:05.709 --> 00:44:06.810
YOU FOR SOMETHING AND IT

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:07.678
DOESN'T HAVE A LIST OF ALL

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:09.246
CURRENT MEDICATIONS AND SO THEY

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:09.980
DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:12.016
CONTRAINDICATED ESPECIALLY IF

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:14.184
THERE'S A SURGICAL PROCEDURE.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.686
ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION THAT

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.821
THAT THEY FELT THAT PATIENTS

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:20.791
FELT NEEDED TO BE CORRECTED

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.226
PATIENTS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:24.028
SHARE ONLINE DATA WITH ANY

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.896
PROVIDER REGARDLESS OF THE

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.064
BRAND OF EACH OUR SYSTEM THAT'S

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:29.266
IN PLACE THE KID TO MAKE TO THE

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.467
COMMITTEE FELT PRETTY STRONGLY

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.102
THAT PATIENTS AS STEWARDS OF

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.771
THEIR OWN DATA SHOULD BE ABLE

00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:35.139
TO DETERMINE WHO ELSE GETS

00:44:35.205 --> 00:44:39.543
ACCESS. TO THOSE DATA.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:46.050
INCLUDING RESEARCHERS. AND

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:46.650
LASTLY THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:47.451
PATIENTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.085
CONSENT TO SHARE ANY SUBSET OF

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:48.652
THEIR DATA SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.587
MEDICAL RESEARCH. THE NEXT

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:51.855
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE THOUGHT

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:55.592
WAS VERY RELEVANT HERE IS IN IN

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:58.295
THE AREA OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS.

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:01.131
AND HERE THE GOAL WAS TO ENACT

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.099
LEGISLATION TO FURTHER

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:05.169
STRENGTHEN THE TELL GINA WHICH

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:06.103
IS THE GENETIC INFORMATION

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:08.172
NONDISCRIMINATION ACT AND TO

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:09.973
ENSURE THAT IT PREVENTS THE ON

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.108
AUTHORIZED USE OF GENETIC

00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:13.610
INFORMATION TO INFLUENCE

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:14.178
WHETHER IT'S EMPLOYMENT OR

00:45:14.244 --> 00:45:16.313
EFFECT ACCESS TO HEALTH LIFE.

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:18.115
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HERE LIFE

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:20.417
LONG TERM DISABILITY INSURANCE

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:22.986
SO TO TAKE A STEP BACK THE

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.888
FEDERAL THE FEDERAL LAW GINA.

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:26.223
PREVENTS EMPLOYERS ARE HEALTH

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.558
INSURERS FROM USING GENETIC

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:29.827
INFORMATION TO PREVENT SOMEONE

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.694
FROM GETTING A JOB OR HEALTH

00:45:30.761 --> 00:45:33.664

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:37.367
HOWEVER APPLY TO EMPLOYERS WITH

INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY SEVERAL

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:44.741
FORMS OF FEDERAL AND MILITARY

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:48.712
INSURANCE. THROUGH CAL GINA SO

00:45:48.779 --> 00:45:50.514
CALIFORNIA WENT AHEAD AND ADDED

00:45:50.581 --> 00:45:52.349
EXTRA PROTECTIONS CALIFORNIA

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.084
EXPANDED THEM TO INCLUDE

FUNDED PROGRAMS BUT NOT LIFE

00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:02.559
FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE. THE

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:03.961
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CAN ON

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.429
BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE WAS

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:06.530
THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXTEND

00:46:06.597 --> 00:46:08.132
THESE PROTECTIONS TO THE

00:46:08.198 --> 00:46:09.800
INCLUDES LIFE AND DISABILITY

AND SEVENTEEN FOR DISABILITY I

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:19.143
DON'T KNOW THE OVERLAP IS AMONG

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:20.978
THOSE ARE BETWEEN THOSE STATES.

DISEASE HUNTINGTON'S IS AN

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:30.120
AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT DISORDER

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:31.922
WHICH MEANS THAT ALL IT TAKES

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.825
IS FOR ONE PERSON OR OR ONE

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:37.528
COPY OF THE PARTICULAR MUTATION

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:41.965
IN THE H. T. T. JEAN. FOR YOU

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:42.566
TO DEVELOP OUTSIDE PART OF ME

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:47.804
HUNTINGTON'S. OFF SPRING I HAVE

00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:48.839
A FIFTY PER CHECK PERCENT

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.107
CHANCE OF DEVELOPING THE

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:52.142
DISORDER. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE.

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.577
VERY MANY ANONYMOUS TESTING

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:54.311
SITES BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE

00:46:54.378 --> 00:46:55.913
MORTIFIED OF HAVING THIS

00:46:55.979 --> 00:46:58.582
INFORMATION LEAKED TO WHAT E.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.617
IT TO ANYBODY THAT COULD

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:01.485
PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:02.986
DISABILITY INSURANCE OR LIFE

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:05.622
INSURANCE SPECIFICALLY. AND SO

00:47:05.689 --> 00:47:06.623
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN

00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:08.759
MOST DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF OUR

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:11.328
PATIENTS IS THAT THEY ARE

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:12.296
REFUSING TO HAVE GENETIC

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:13.230
TESTING WHEN MEDICALLY

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:15.666
NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE FEAR

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:19.203
THAT RAMIFICATIONS. ON THE

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:25.008
DISCRIMINATORY SIDE. OOPS

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:25.976
OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS AND

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:30.881
CONCLUSION SO IN SUMMARY. THE

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:32.482
COMMITTEE FELT VERY VERY

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.116
GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD THE

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.752
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTENT COME

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.453
TOGETHER TO DEVELOP THESE

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.755
RECOMMENDATIONS A RESERVE IT

00:47:38.822 --> 00:47:41.892
WAS UNANIMOUS THAT WE SHOULD

00:47:41.959 --> 00:47:42.526
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PRECISION

00:47:42.593 --> 00:47:45.829
HEALTH AND MEDICINE. IT WAS

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:47.898
ALSO IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH AN

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:48.899
ECONOMIC AND COST MODEL COUNCIL

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:50.701
PRECISION MEDICINE THE FEARS

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:51.435
ARE THAT IT COULD EASILY

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.036
BANKRUPT US NOT AS AN ONLY AS A

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:54.338
NATION BUT AS THE STATE IF NOT

00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:56.873
DONE WELL. SO TO CONTINUE THE

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.675
WORK IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.210
AND IF INFORMED FUTURE FUNDING

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:02.379
AND POLICY DECISIONS IT WOULD

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.714
BE IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH SOME

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.850
KIND OF COUNSEL. NOW JUST TO

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:07.884
REITERATE IT REITERATE VERY

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:10.187
BRIEFLY THROUGH THE CIA PM. THE

00:48:10.254 --> 00:48:11.588
STATE HAS INVESTED FIFTY THREE

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:12.990
MILLION TO SUPPORT RESEARCH AND

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:14.291
PRECISION MEDICINE ACROSS THE

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:16.159
STATE. THE FIRST THIRTEEN

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:17.361
MILLION BROUGHT IN A MATCHING

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.895
TEN MILLION AN INSTITUTIONAL

00:48:18.962 --> 00:48:22.099
FOUNDATION AND PRIVATE FUNDS

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:22.899
THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:24.635
LEVERAGE OUTSIDE FUNDING. IN

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.802
ADDITION TO CANCER WERE

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.337

THE SOURCE OF THOSE ERRORS. AND

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.830
WHY ARE HEALTH SYSTEMS SO

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:03.967
RESISTANT. TWO PATIENTS OWNING

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:12.676
THEIR OWN. DATA WELL. THAT'S IT

00:50:12.743 --> 00:50:13.944
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.312
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE THOSE

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.847
WERE TWO KEY ISSUES THAT WERE

00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:17.781
DISCUSSED AT THE COMMITTEE

WITH ERRORS AT FOR A LOT OF

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.454
REASONS MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:29.092
PUTTING IN DATA. AS YOU MIGHT

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:29.693
HAVE SOME LAB VALUES THAT ARE

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.560
ACTUALLY IN CORRECTIVE KIDDING

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:32.662
THAT CAME BACK FROM A

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.531
PARTICULAR LAB AND THEY WERE

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:35.899
WRONG AND THEY WERE REPEATED OR

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:40.036
FLAG. YOU MAY HAVE THE PATIENTS

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:42.773
WHO ARE THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY

INFORMATION TO THE PROVIDER THE

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.711
UPDATED INFORMATION TYPICALLY

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.012
WHAT A LOT OF HEALTH SYSTEMS

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.914
ARE DOING IS THAT AT AT FIRST

00:50:50.981 --> 00:50:52.249
ENCOUNTER WITH THE PATIENT.

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.650
THEY WILL ASK THEM WHETHER

00:50:53.717 --> 00:50:54.818
THEY'LL CHECK THEIR MEDICATIONS

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.253
AND THERE'S A PROTOCOL THAT

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:56.920
THEY USE THAT THE MEDICAL

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:58.221
ASSISTANCE TYPICALLY USED TO

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:02.058
MAKE SURE THAT. TO ENSURE THAT

00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:07.998
THOSE DATA ARE CORRECT. I AM

00:51:08.064 --> 00:51:10.333
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT THE Q. WHY

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.835
PROCESS SEES THAT ARE A WHY

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:12.936
DATE YOU KNOW HOW OR WHY I KNOW

00:51:13.003 --> 00:51:14.504
THAT YOU SEE LIKE WE'RE WORKING

VERY CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.907
SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY ERRORS. AND

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:18.275
SOMETIMES. THERE'S ONE THING TO

00:51:18.341 --> 00:51:20.277
IDENTIFY THEM THERE'S ANOTHER

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.378
TO IDENTIFY THEM AND GET THEM

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:23.947
BACK TO THE SOURCE. AND SO IT

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.982
IT DOES THAT IT THOSE ARE SOME

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:26.817
OF THE ISSUES THAT HEALTH

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:30.987
SYSTEMS ARE WRESTLING WITH WHEN

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:37.160

DISCUSSED WITHIN THE WIT WITHIN

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.930
THIS COMMITTEE UP ONE OF THE

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:05.468
KEY ISSUES AND. YOU SEE THIS

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:07.037
EVERYWHERE IT'S NOT JUST WITH

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.638
PRIVATE INDUSTRY NOT WANTING TO

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.841
SHARE DATA ACADEMICS. ON THE A

00:55:11.908 --> 00:55:14.277
FOR ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.746
DATA BREACHES ARE. FEARED SO

00:55:16.813 --> 00:55:18.982
EVERYBODY IS VERY MINDFUL THAT

00:55:19.049 --> 00:55:20.884
AS STEWARDS OF DATA THEY WANT

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.652
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S NOT

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:26.723
LEAKED AND THAT WE ARE BEING

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.759
FAITHFUL AND- OF. AUTHENTICS

00:55:29.826 --> 00:55:31.928
TOWARDS ONE ONE OF THE THINGS

00:55:31.995 --> 00:55:32.495
THAT THE COMMITTEE ACTUALLY

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.464
DID. DID DISCUSS AT LENGTH WAS

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:37.534
HAVING SOME SORT OF CENTRALIZED

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:40.003
DATA WAREHOUSE STAKEHOLDERS

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.304
HAVE TO BE INCENTIVIZE TO

00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:44.240
PARTICIPATE. THERE WOULD HAVE

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:47.043
TO BE OBVIOUSLY A DATA

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:49.179
AGREEMENTS IN PLACE SO THERE

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:51.414
WOULD THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:52.816
GROUP THAT PERHAPS COULD COME

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:54.784
UP WITH. DATA USE AGREEMENTS

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:57.287
CONFIDENTIALLY CONNECTICUT FOR

00:55:57.353 --> 00:55:57.787
THE CHARITY IN PRIVACY

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.756
AGREEMENTS UP FOR PATIENTS TO

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:02.392
SHARE THEIR DATA DEPENDING ON

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.827
THE KIND OF DATA THEY NEED TO

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:05.795
PROVIDE CONSENT AND SO THERE

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:07.063
HAVE TO BE INCENTIVES FOR FOLKS

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.665
TO RE CONSENT PATIENTS THAT.

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.767
HAVE NOT BEEN CONSENTED WITH

00:56:10.834 --> 00:56:12.602
WHATEVER CURRENT LANGUAGE WOULD

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:14.404
HAVE TO GO IN THERE SO I DO

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:15.438
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:16.906
SHOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER

00:56:16.973 --> 00:56:18.641
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS TOP OF

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.477
MIND FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:22.512
COMMITTEE. BECAUSE BRINGING

00:56:22.579 --> 00:56:24.481
DATA TOGETHER PRECISION HEALTH

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.616
AND MEDICINE IS IT'S ABOUT

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:28.218
LOOKING FOR PATTERNS IN DATA

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:30.720
ENTRY. WHAT'S GOING TO GET US

00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:33.189
THERE IS A LOT OF DATA. SO THE

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:35.358
MORE DATA WE HAVE THE BETTER

00:56:35.425 --> 00:56:35.959
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

00:56:36.025 --> 00:56:37.994
PREDICTIONS SO. CRITICS FOR THE

00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.063
STATE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.100
CREATE A BODY AN ENTITY AND A

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:49.572
MECHANISM. TO SUPPORT THAT

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:50.039
WOULD I THINK WHAT AT

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:58.748
INCREDIBLE VALUE. I HAVE A

00:56:58.815 --> 00:56:59.983
LITTLE BIT TAD IF I MAY UM WE-

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:02.085
YOU MENTIONED INFORMED CONSENT

00:57:02.152 --> 00:57:05.155
AND THAT. IN PRACTICE MEANS.

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:05.789
READING A SCRIPT AND HAVING TO

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:06.389
BE SIGNED SOMETHING AND THAT

00:57:06.456 --> 00:57:07.123
MIGHT BE VERY DIFFERENT

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.324
DEPENDING ON THE CULTURE

00:57:08.391 --> 00:57:09.959
BACKGROUND AND LANGUAGE OF THE

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:10.426
PERSON IT IS HE'S BEEN

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.828
CONSENTED SO HAVING A-

00:57:11.895 --> 00:57:13.363
CULTURALLY COMPETENT. CONSENT

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.097
IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER IS

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.698
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND I

00:57:15.765 --> 00:57:17.500
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND

00:57:17.567 --> 00:57:19.702
ONE OF THE AN EXAMPLE OF KIND

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:21.070
OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:24.340
TERMS OF. THE BARRIERS TO

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.942
SHARING RESEARCH AND THE EFFECT

00:57:26.009 --> 00:57:29.712
THAT IT IS CURRENTLY HAVING ON

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:35.618
CLINICAL CARE IS THAT.

00:57:35.685 --> 00:57:37.754
PHYSICIANS WHO TREATS PATIENTS

00:57:37.821 --> 00:57:39.622
WITH DRUG ADDICTIONS ARE BY LAW

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:40.190
NOT ALLOWED TO SHARE THAT

00:57:40.256 --> 00:57:46.029
INFORMATION WITH ANY OTHER.

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.997
TREATING PHYSICIANS AND THAT

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:51.301
LAW WAS PUT INTO PLACE A LONG

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:52.235
TIME AGO WHEN ADDICTION

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.903
MEDICINE THE SORT OF THOUGHT OF

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:56.773
AS ITS OWN ISLAND OF CARE. BUT

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.542
NOW WE AS WE INCORPORATED INTO

00:57:59.609 --> 00:58:01.311
AT THE BROADER MENTAL HEALTH

00:58:01.377 --> 00:58:04.514
CARE IT MIGHT BE TIME TO

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:04.981
REVISIT THOSE FEDERAL

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:08.284
GUIDELINES. I WOULD ALSO LIKE

00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.285
TO POINT TO ONE OF OUR

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.087
PREVIOUSLY FUNDED GRANTS TO

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:12.322
DOCTOR SHELDON GREENFIELD AT UC

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:14.090
IRVINE HE WAS DEVELOPING A

00:58:14.157 --> 00:58:16.392
FEDERATED DATA SYSTEM WHERE BY

00:58:16.459 --> 00:58:18.027
VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS V. A.'S

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.029
YOU SEE AND COUNTY HOSPITALS

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:20.864
WERE ABLE TO SHARE THEIR DATA

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.966
WITHOUT STEPPING ACROSS THEIR

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:25.735
OWN INSTITUTIONAL DATA PRIVACY.

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:28.238
POLICIES SO IT WAS ACCESS TO DE

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:31.574
IDENTIFY DATA WITHOUT ACTUALLY

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:32.775
PROVIDING DATA FOR THEM TO USE

00:58:32.842 --> 00:58:35.545
FOR ANY REASON. FEDERATED

00:58:35.612 --> 00:58:36.179
DATABASE SYSTEM IT'S SOMETHING

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.747
IN THE FUTURE ABSOLUTELY AND SO

00:58:37.814 --> 00:58:39.048
WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT'S GOING

00:58:39.115 --> 00:58:40.950
TO MAKE FOLKS LESS SKITTISH IF

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.285
YOU SAY THAT THEY CAN KEEP

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:43.586
THEIR DATA BUT THE DATA CAN BE

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:45.889
FEDERATED THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:48.024
SUPPORT THAT IS. IS GOING TO BE

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.927
CRITICAL AND BUT IT IS IT HAT

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:54.063
WE HAVE DATA TO SHOW THAT IT IS

00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.101
A VERY POSITIVE. AVENUE IT

00:58:58.167 --> 00:59:00.003

REPORT BUT IT IT COULD HAVE

00:59:14.817 --> 00:59:16.452
INCREDIBLE VALUE IS THE IS THE

00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:17.420
OTHER SIDE OF THE TRANSLATIONAL

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.322
PIPELINE WE'RE COLLECTING ALL

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.658
OF THIS DATA. AND AT AND WE

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:23.293
NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF HOW THESE

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:25.628

PATIENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE THE

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.534
BEDSIDE SO TO SPEAK. AND

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:33.369
THERE'S A FEDERAL BILL THAT'S

00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.972
BEEN SITTING THAT WOULD MAKE

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:38.007
GENETIC COUNSELORS CMS

00:59:38.074 --> 00:59:39.876
PROVIDERS CURRENTLY THEY'RE NOT

AND BY MAKING THEM CMS

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.146
PROVIDERS IT WOULD IT WOULD

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:45.815
ACTUALLY INCREASE ACCESS TO

00:59:45.882 --> 00:59:47.784
FOLKS WHO IN MEDICARE AND ALSO

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.352
MEDI CAL AND SO PERHAPS THE

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:53.556
STATE COULD. DO SOMETHING TO

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:56.826

01:00:50.713 --> 01:00:52.081
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.250
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

WITH EACH OTHER AND SO WE CAN

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:25.381
REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.771
CALIFORNIANS ARE ALL PEOPLE

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:38.040
ACROSS SOCIOECONOMIC STRAT A

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:40.076
AND THAT'S HEART DISEASE AND I

01:04:40.142 --> 01:04:42.144
WANT TO START WITH AN IMAGE

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:44.013
THIS IS. FRIEND OF MINE NAMED

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.881
ERIN AND AT THIS PARTICULAR

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.683
MOMENT HE IS MONITORING A GROUP

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:49.652
OF PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:50.987
WHO HAVE BEEN WIRED UP WITH

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.888
WEARABLE BIOSENSORS THAT HAVE

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:53.990
BEEN CREATED HERE IN

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:59.562
CALIFORNIA. AT THIS PARTICULAR

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.863
MOMENT IS NOTICING CHANGES ON

01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.632
AN EKG THAT SUGGESTS THAT

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:03.866
SOMEBODY MAY BE ABOUT TO HAVE A

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:05.034
HEART ATTACK SO HE CALLS UP

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:06.936
THAT PATIENT. AND HE SAYS HOW

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:07.870
ARE YOU FEELING MISTER ANDERSON

01:05:07.937 --> 01:05:09.272
AND HE SAYS I'M FEELING FINE HE

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:10.373
SAYS I NEED TO TAKE TWO

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:11.374
ASPIRINS AND GO TO THE

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.109
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:13.709
BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:16.779
HEART ATTACK. NOW TURNS OUT

01:05:16.846 --> 01:05:19.315
THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT REAL

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:21.017
THIS IS A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:21.517
SET. ON THE BACKLOT OF

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:24.053
UNIVERSAL STUDIOS. AND THIS IS

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.187
A TELEVISION SHOW THAT WAS

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:26.922
PRIME TIME AND CBS BASED UPON

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.424
OUR RESEARCH GRANT FROM CA A

01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.426
PM. SO I WAS FORTUNATE TO

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:32.328
PARTICIPATE AND SCRIPTING THIS

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:33.529
SHOW AND BEING A PART OF THE

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:34.664
SHOW THAT'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.898
OF BEING A LOS ANGELES BUT THIS

01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:37.933
IS A VISION. OF WHERE WE WANT

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.368
TO BE AND WHAT WE STUDY DOES

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.070
WHETHER WE ACTUALLY CAN GET

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:43.406
THERE. SO THIS ISN'T SO SCIENCE

01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.807
FICTION THERE ACTUALLY ARE

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.275
EXAMPLES OF THIS IN REAL LIFE

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:47.410
RIGHT NOW THIS IS A MERCY

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:49.378
HEALTH SYSTEM. IN THE MIDWEST

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.146
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:51.147
EXAMPLES LIKE THIS IN

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.215
CALIFORNIA. DOESN'T LOOK QUITE

01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:54.583
AS FANCY BUT WE HAVE THE

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.419
ABILITY NOW. TO USE WEARABLE

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.120
BIOSENSORS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF

01:05:58.187 --> 01:05:59.455
REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:01.157
TECHNIQUES. TO EVALUATE

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.425
PATIENTS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:03.626
THE HOSPITAL WITH US WHEN

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:04.560
THEY'RE NOT RIGHT IN FRONT OF

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.762
US. IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR

01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:08.964
IN A CLINIC. OR IN AND I'M

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:11.334
OPERATING ROOM. SO WE CAN DO

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.369
THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS NOW

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:14.337
TO ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.305
DEVICES THIS IS CREATED BY. A

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:17.673
COMPANY CALLED ALIVE CORE HERE

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.141
IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE CAR

01:06:19.208 --> 01:06:21.143
GET DEVICES IS AN FDA CLEARED

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:22.411
DEVICE THAT WE USE REGULARLY

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:24.180
AND USED IN THIS STUDY. TO

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:26.682
MONITOR PATIENTS HEARTS. IT IS

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:29.618
AN FDA CLEARED EKG MONITOR. YOU

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:30.519
CERTAINLY MAY HAVE HEARD THAT

01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:32.421
APPLE HAS ITS OWN AT FTA

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.589
CLEARED VERSION OF THIS AS WELL

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.157
FOR THE FOR THE APPLE WATCH.

01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:36.492
AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:37.526
WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT

01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.628
DEVICES THAT COME FROM. MANY OF

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.197
OUR PARTNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:42.898
FITBIT FOR EXAMPLE IS A COMPANY

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:44.533
WE WORK CLOSELY WITH AND I'LL

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.302
SHOW A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.937
HOW WE WORK WITH THAT THAT.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.004
THAT CREATES A NUMBER FOR

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:50.306
DEVICES. THERE'S EVEN A BELT

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:51.307
THAT HAS A COMPUTER IN IT I

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:53.576
HAPPEN OWN THAT BUILT THAT IT'S

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:54.643
A VERY NICE BELT. I DON'T

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.979
ACTUALLY USE IT IT TELLS ME IF

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:58.147
I MEAN TOO MUCH AND I KIND OF

01:06:58.214 --> 01:06:59.348
KNOW IF I MEAN TO MUCH. ON ON

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.049
THE- COMPUTER ABOUT TELL ME

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.484
THAT. SO WHAT I'M REALLY

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.420
DESCRIBING HERE IS SORT OF AN

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:06.355
EVOLVING VISION FOR HOW WE CAN.

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.424
EVER HEALTH CARE. AND THE WILL

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:10.393
BE TYPICALLY DELIVER HEALTHCARE

01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:12.728
IS WE'RE ALL IN. THIS IS ROOM.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:13.596
FOR ALL THE HOSPITAL OR CLINIC

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:19.835
I'M A PHYSICIAN I SEE PATIENTS.

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:20.436
I HAPPEN TO BE A GASTROENTEROL

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:25.741
JUST BUT WE HAVE. NOW THAT ARE

01:07:25.808 --> 01:07:26.208
INCREASINGLY ABLE TO

01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:26.842
COMMUNICATE WITH US NOT JUST IN

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:27.743
PERSON. BUT THROUGH ALL THESE

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.310
BLUETOOTH CONNECTED DEVICES

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:28.811
THROUGH HIPPA COMPLIANT

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.412
CHANNELS. THAT THEY CAN SHARE

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.113
THEIR DATA WITH US THROUGH OUR

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:31.680
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD THE

01:07:31.747 --> 01:07:32.314
PIPES ARE THERE. IT'S A TRICK

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:32.882
THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME

01:07:32.948 --> 01:07:33.616
TRIVIAL. THE HARD PART IS

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:34.450
SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS HOW

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:35.017
SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS AND

01:07:35.084 --> 01:07:35.651
SHOULD WE BE PAYING FOR SUCH A

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:36.919
PROGRAM. BECAUSE NOW THAT

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.387
PATIENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:40.022
SHARE ALL THE DATA WITH US THE

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:41.657
QUESTION IS. WHO'S IN CHARGE OF

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.992
THAT. AND WHAT WE'RE STARTING

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.326
TO REALIZE WE NEED A NEW TYPE

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:46.262
OF CLINICIAN. A DIGITAL AS- THE

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:47.897
DIGITAL ESTAS LIKE THAT PICTURE

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.098
FROM THE TV SHOW THIS IS

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.466
SOMEBODY WHO LIVES. IN A

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:51.567
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT AND THE

01:07:51.634 --> 01:07:53.369
DIGITAL COMMAND CENTER WHOSE

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.670
ROLE IS TO PRECISELY MONITOR

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.205
PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY WITH OF

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.773
COURSE THEIR- CONSENT

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.175
AGREEMENT. AND TO MONITOR

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.309
DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:02.178
BIOMETRIC PSYCHOMETRICS HOW

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.312
THEY ACTUALLY FEELING.

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:04.947
BIOMARKERS SO WE CAN MEASURE AT

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.649
HOME. AND THEN TO COMMUNICATE

01:08:06.715 --> 01:08:07.750
DIRECTLY WITH THOSE PATIENTS

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.652
WHILE THE REST OF US ARE BUSY.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.686
TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS IN

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.254
PERSON. IF SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.789
THEY NEED MY HELP PHYSICALLY

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.291
THAT'S WHEN THE DIGITAL THIS

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.459
WILL SEND THE PATIENT TO ME.

01:08:16.525 --> 01:08:18.027
RATHER THAN SOME RANDOM PERIOD

01:08:18.093 --> 01:08:19.061
OF TIME. THAT SORT OF

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:20.696
PREDETERMINED. YOU KNOW BY

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:22.064
MAGIC EIGHT BALL IT MAKES MORE

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.799
SENSE TO ACTUALLY. ENGAGE

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.701
PEOPLE. WHEN THEY NEED HELP

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.902
BECAUSE WITHIN TEN MILES OF

01:08:26.969 --> 01:08:27.736
HERE RIGHT NOW THERE'S

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.705
UNDOUBTEDLY A CHILD WHO STARTED

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.307
TO GET SHORT OF BREATH AND IS

01:08:31.373 --> 01:08:31.874
GOING TO BE IN THE EMERGENCY

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:32.475
DEPARTMENT TOMORROW WITH AN

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:34.210
ASTHMA ATTACK. WELL WHY CAN'T

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.244
WE FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT NOW

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.580
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NOW.

01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:38.814
AND AVOID THAT EXPENSIVE

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:39.949
ADMISSION. THAT COULD ACTUALLY

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.016
BE TERRIBLY POOR OUTCOMES WE

01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:43.319
HAVE THE- ABILITIES TO DO THIS

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:46.922
NOW. SO THIS IS A PICTURE OF MY

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:49.358
OWN CLINIC AT CEDAR SINAI IT.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:52.161
LIKE ANY OTHER CLINIC FROM

01:08:52.228 --> 01:08:53.195
NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE EXCEPT FOR

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:55.364
THAT COMPUTER IN THE MIDDLE.

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:57.933
THAT IS DESIGNED BY

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.002
ADMINISTRATORS AND BILL FIRST.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:03.973
PORT AND SECTIONAL NEEDS NOT TO

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:06.942
SUPPORT THE BIOPIC WAS. TWENTY

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:09.211
TWENTY PATIENTS. PROVIDE US AND

01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:15.851
NOW FOR GOOD. NOT FOR

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:16.418
COLLECTING IT WHICH IS AMEND

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:21.423
THIS OPPORTUNITY. THERE MAY NOT

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.858
BE TREATED ALL THAT WELL. AND

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:24.260
THEN YOU LEAVE PEOPLE COME TO

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.661
THIS ROOM FOR VERY TINY AMOUNTS

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:27.229
OF TIME. BUT WHERE PEOPLE

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.964
REALLY ARE IS AT WORK AT HOME

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.799
AND SENIOR CENTERS AT THE PARK.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.268
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO ENGAGE

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:33.502
CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:34.537
HEALTHCARE WE HAVE TO FIND A

01:09:34.603 --> 01:09:35.804
WAY TO GO BEYOND THE FOUR

01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.172
WALLS. OF OUR PHYSICAL

01:09:37.239 --> 01:09:38.274
ENVIRONMENTS WHERE WE ARE

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.609
CURRENTLY SITUATED ENGAGE THEM

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:41.744
IN THEIR REAL LIVES AND THAT'S

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.913
THE VISION OF DIGITAL HEALTH

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.247
BROADLY. AND PRECISE DIGITAL

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.650
HEALTH IN PARTICULAR. SO AGAIN

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.084
GETTING TO THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:50.619
FUNDED FROM OUR STUDY OF A

01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:51.620
PATIENT COMES TO SEE ME

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.522
DISAPPEARS AND COMES BACK SIX

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:54.623
OR EIGHT WEEKS LATER. IT'S IN

01:09:54.690 --> 01:09:55.724
THE CRACKS IT'S IN THE MIDDLE

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.926
OR SOMEBODY HAD A HEART ATTACK

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.494
THAT NOBODY SAW COMING. AND

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.029
THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR REMOTE

01:10:00.095 --> 01:10:01.730
PATIENT MONITORING. TO SORT OF

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.432
FILL IN THE BLANKS USING THIS

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.734
KIND OF. CHARACTER LIKE ERIN

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:06.969
WHO ACTUALLY IS THAT IS HIS

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.103
REAL NAME IS AN ACTOR THOUGH.

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.805
CAN HE USE BIOMARKER CYCLE

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:12.107
MARKERS ARE BIOMETRICS AND THIS

01:10:12.174 --> 01:10:14.143
IS WHAT WE STUDIED WITH RCA PM

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:15.844
SUPPORTED THAT STUDY. IT WAS

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.346
REALLY A PILOT STUDY MAINLY TO

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.114
SEE IS IT EVEN FEASIBLE TO DO

01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:20.916
THIS. IS IT TECHNICALLY CAPABLE

01:10:20.983 --> 01:10:22.284
WE ARE TECHNICALLY CAPABLE OF

01:10:22.351 --> 01:10:24.053
DOING THIS AND ARE THERE ANY

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:25.287
SINGLES IN THE NOISE THAT. WE

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:26.221
COULD USE ARTIFICIAL

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:27.723
INTELLIGENCE RATHER TYPES OF

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.558
SIGNAL SEARCH ENGINES TO FIND

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:30.826
PATTERNS THAT WOULD PREDICT

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.294
SOMEBODY. WHO IS ACTUALLY GONNA

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:34.229
GET IN TROUBLE. AND THEN WE

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:35.164
ALSO LOOKED AT THE HEALTH

01:10:35.230 --> 01:10:36.699
ECONOMICS OF THIS CAN WE IT IS

01:10:36.765 --> 01:10:38.400
WILL IT EVER EVEN BE COST

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:39.635
EFFECTIVE FOR THIRD PARTY PAYER

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.337
TO SUPPORT SUCH A PROGRAM SO

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.771
IT'S A PRETTY AMBITIOUS.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.940
PROGRAM THAT WE UNDERTOOK. AND

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.442
SO WE WORKED WITH A NUMBER OF

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.777
DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA COMPANIES

01:10:48.844 --> 01:10:50.212
TO MEASURE BIOMARKERS

01:10:50.279 --> 01:10:55.150
BIOMETRICS AND PSYCHOMETRICS

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:55.951
AND SOME OF THEM ARE LISTED

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.688
THERE. DISCUSSED UP THAT BIT.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:04.326
OF AT THE BASE WITH. COMPANY.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:06.161
FORMAT THAT WE CAN USE ON A

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:06.662
RESEARCH SIDE OR THROUGH

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:07.663
ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. ALIVE

01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:08.330
CORE CREATES THAT SENSOR THAT I

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:09.999
DESCRIBED EARLIER. AND WE ALSO

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:10.499
WE'RE ABLE TO WORK WITH

01:11:10.566 --> 01:11:11.300
COMPANIES NEAR TERRACE AND

01:11:11.367 --> 01:11:12.301
THERMO FISHER. THIS IS NOT

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:12.901
THERE KNOWS THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:13.869
FDA CLEARED TECHNOLOGY WHERE

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:14.403
PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE A LITTLE

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:16.238
BLOOD SAMPLE. AND SEND IT TO US

01:11:16.305 --> 01:11:17.006
IN THE MAIL WHERE WE CAN BE

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:18.407
PROTEOMICS GENOMICS LIPID OMICS

01:11:18.474 --> 01:11:19.675
ON THESE BLOOD SAMPLES IT'S

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:21.176
PRETTY. REMARKABLE WORK AND WE

01:11:21.243 --> 01:11:22.311
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHERE THE

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.312
SIGNAL MIGHT BE THAT'S GOING TO

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:24.213
PREDICT. WHO'S GONNA

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:25.714
POTENTIALLY HAVE A HEART ATTACK

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.549
BEFORE IT HAPPENS. BUT WE ALSO

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.951
CAN'T FORGET ABOUT HOW PEOPLE

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:31.286
ACTUALLY FEEL. OF HOW PEOPLE

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.254
ARE SLEEPING HEALTH PEOPLE

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:33.889
HOWEVER THEY FEEL FATIGUE TIRED

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:35.090
DEPRESSED SAD THESE ARE

01:11:35.157 --> 01:11:36.025
IMPORTANT FEATURES THAT ARE

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.693
PART OF PRECISION MEDICINE

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.827
PRECISION MEDICINE IS NOT JUST

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.095
ABOUT GENOMICS. IT'S ABOUT

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:42.297
FULLY CHARACTERIZING PATIENTS

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.832
ACROSS BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL DOMAINS

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.567
OF HEALTH CARE. I WANT TO GIVE

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:46.702
YOU AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE FROM A

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.270
PATIENT IN OUR STUDY THIS IS A

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.005
DIRECT RESULT OF. OUR STUDY%

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:51.507
FROM THE FUNDING THAT WE THAT

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.876
WE OBTAINED. THIS IS A PATIENT

01:11:53.942 --> 01:11:56.645
WHO WAS MEASURING HIS. HIS

01:11:56.712 --> 01:11:58.981
HEART RATE. WITH THE SENSOR AND

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.783
ALL THIS ON THE COMPUTER TURNED

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:01.850
RED IT TOLD THE PATIENT

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.419
SOMETHING. WAS GOING ON THAT

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:05.888
SHOULD BE. IT ALL THE PATIENT

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:06.789
THAT HE SHOULD PROBABLY GET A

01:12:06.855 --> 01:12:08.257
KICK CARE. AWAY HE ACTUALLY

01:12:08.323 --> 01:12:09.792
CAME INTO OUR EMERGENCY

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.294
DEPARTMENT AND YOU CAN SEE

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:14.229
ELEVEN THIRTY TWO PM. THAT IS

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:17.166
THE SENSOR FROM AT HOME AND

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:19.735
THEN WHEN HE CAME TO SEE US. AT

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:21.070
RIGHT TWELVE THIRTY IN THE

01:12:21.136 --> 01:12:23.205
MORNING WE FORMA. LEADING AG

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.206
THAT ACTUALLY FOUND GET. INTO

01:12:24.273 --> 01:12:25.708
A- DANGEROUS RIP. AND HE WAS

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.410
PARTY OVERDID ACTUALLY SHORT OF

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.145
THAT OVER. AS A RESULT OF

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.180
COMING IN NOW HE MAY HAVE COME

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:32.381
IN ANYWAY DON'T KNOW BUT HE

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:34.983
CAME IN PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THE

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.085
COMPUTER TOLD HIM. THIS IS

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.453
PACKED FULL. BENEFIT OF THE

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.021
STUDY ITSELF. AND WHEN WE LOOK

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:39.655
BACK IN TIME IS MORE HERE THAN

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:41.156
I WOULD CARE TO GO THROUGH AT

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:41.990
THE TIME THERE'S ALL SORTS OF

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.992
OTHER DATA WE WERE COLLECTING.

01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:46.028
AND THE QUESTION IS CAN A

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.130
COMPUTER HELP US. FIND A SIGNAL

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.231
AND ALL THAT ALWAYS. WAS HE

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.033
SLEEPING. MORE POORLY IN THE

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.367
DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS WHETHER

01:12:52.434 --> 01:12:53.902
OTHER FACTORS IT TURNS OUT

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:54.503
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:56.271
THAT IF WE LOOK AT CAREFULLY.

01:12:56.338 --> 01:13:01.910
WE. CAN START TO OUT TO

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:02.478
EVALUATE. THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:09.051
MANY PAPER. NOW BEGIN PUBLISHES

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.152
IT IS ALL OF THIS THIS IS IN

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.320
JAM YEAH WHICH IS THE LEADING

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.154
INFORMATICS JOURNAL. AND REALLY

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:12.955
SHOWED IS THAT THIS IS FEASIBLE

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:13.589
THAT THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDY

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:14.156
WERE WILLING TO USE IN THIS

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.057
CASE TO FIT THAT. OVER 90% OF

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:15.924
THE PATIENTS IN THE STUDY WERE

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:16.558
WILLING TO USE IT. AND THAT'S

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:17.760
QUITE HIGHER. THAN GENERAL YOU

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:18.660
KNOW CONSUMERS WHO ARE USING

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:20.095
MAY BE WEARABLE DEVICES FOR

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:21.263
HEALTH AND WELLNESS PURPOSES.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.132
WHEN A DOCTOR WORKS OF THE

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:24.099
PATIENT AND EXPLAINS WHY WERE

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.634
USING THIS. POWER COULD

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.436
POTENTIALLY HELP THEM WE FIND

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.638
90% OF PARENTS IN THE STUDY. SO

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.973
THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE JUST WANT

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.040
TO EMPHASIZE THAT THEIR NUMBER

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:32.574
OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE THAT

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:34.610
PARTICIPATED ACROSS DIFFERENT

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.712
DISCIPLINES THIS IS A STUDY.

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.947
THAT INVOLVED HEALTH ECONOMICS

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.682
PSYCHOMETRIC SHINS BIOMETRIC

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:43.752
SHINS. GENETICISTS INCREDIBLE

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:45.387
ARRAY OF PEOPLE FROM UCLA FROM

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.222
CEDAR SINAI. A NUMBER OF

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.290
DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND JUST

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.092
WANT TO THANK AGAIN CA EIGHT PM

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:07.135
ALSO HERE. AS AN AWARD EAT THIS

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:10.739
YEAR OF A C. I. A. P. M.

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:14.810
MEDICINE GRANT. AND IN

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:16.211
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STANFORD

01:15:16.278 --> 01:15:18.780
CANCER INSTITUTE. I'M SPEAKING

01:15:18.847 --> 01:15:20.616
AS A COMMUNITY PARTNER IN THIS

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.651
ENDEAVOR. I SPEAK AS A CANCER

SURVIVOR WHO NOW SPEAKS FOR

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:25.454
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW THEY HAVE

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.956
A VOICE. AND I SPEAK AS A

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:28.824
CONCERNED CITIZEN WHOSE

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:31.193
TAXPAYER DOLLARS FUND THIS KEY

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.295
INITIATIVE THAT CAN IMPACT ALL

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.998
OF OUR HEALTH THAT OF OUR

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:36.598
FAMILY OR MORE BROADLY ALL OF

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:39.468
OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. A FEW

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:41.637
YEARS AGO I RECEIVED A FACEBOOK

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.239
PLEA IN SPANISH FROM THE SISTER

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.874
OF A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD. A

01:15:45.941 --> 01:15:48.377
LATINO MEXICAN MAIL IN CHICAGO

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.078
HE WAS BATTLING FOURTH STAGE

01:15:50.145 --> 01:15:51.246
LEUKEMIA AND HE NEEDED A

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:53.649
TRANSPLANT COULD I HELP.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.284
FURTHER INVESTIGATION FOUND

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:56.685
THAT THE SOCIAL WORKER IN THE

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:57.920
PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THERE

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.088
HAD USED ALL OF THE BAILABLE.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.657
AVENUES OPEN TO KEEP THAT YOUNG

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.226
MAN ALIVE. BUT HERE IS WHAT WAS

01:16:04.293 --> 01:16:05.627
REALLY DISHEARTENING. SHE

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:06.762
ACTUALLY HAD FOUND A CLINICAL

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:08.964
TRIAL. THE YOUNG MAN WAS

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:10.666
ALLOWED TO GO INTO TREATMENT ON

01:16:10.732 --> 01:16:13.402
THAT TRIAL DRUG AND AFTER A

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.770
SERIES OF ROUNDS OF TREATMENTS

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.438
HE WAS IN REMISSION. BUT

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:17.472
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ACTUALLY

01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:19.641
ELIGIBLE FOR THE TRIAL IT WAS

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:21.343
IN A PRIVATE HOSPITAL HE DID

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.879
NOT HAVE INSURANCE HE WAS

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.013
BOTTOM LINE REFUSED FURTHER

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.815
TREATMENT. SO I AS A SOCIAL

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:27.950
WORKER WHAT PROBABLY WHAT WOULD

01:16:28.016 --> 01:16:30.018
HAPPEN IF HE RELAPSES SHE SAID

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:30.585
HE WOULD HAVE TO RETURN TO

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.854
AROUND OF PROBABLY INEFFECTIVE

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:33.388
CHEMO. UNLESS HE FOUND A

01:16:33.455 --> 01:16:35.924
TRANSPLANT MATCH. THAT IS THE

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:38.226
LAST I HEARD OF THAT CASE BUT

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.395
IT HAUNTS ME TO THIS DAY.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:43.231
ETHICS REGULATION RULES ALL

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:47.502
SEEM WRONG HERE. IT WAS FROM

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:49.004
THE SENSE OF HELPLESSNESS THAT

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:49.638
THE LATINO CANCER INSTITUTE WAS

01:16:49.705 --> 01:16:50.639
BORN TO UNITE. LATINO AGENCIES

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.308
AMPLIFIER VOICES INFLUENCE BOTH

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:55.310
TREATMENT AND POLICIES THAT

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:56.611
CHANGE CARE OUTCOMES FOR THE

01:16:56.678 --> 01:16:58.780
BETTER. TO IN FACT ADDRESSED

01:16:58.847 --> 01:17:01.650
THOSE DISPARITIES THAT INHIBIT

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:02.250
QUALITY EQUITY AND AFFORDABLE

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:06.355
CARE. SO I JOINED WITH STANFORD

01:17:06.421 --> 01:17:09.825
ON THE CIA PM GRANT WITH A VERY

01:17:09.891 --> 01:17:11.259
LONG TITLE THAT YOU SEE HERE IF

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:13.895
YOU CAN EVEN READ IT. A NEW

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:14.529
PRECISION MEDICINE FOR THE EYES

01:17:14.596 --> 01:17:17.933
NOW DOCTOR. LED BY ONCOLOGIST

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.634
MANALI PATEL IN OUR PREVENTION

01:17:19.701 --> 01:17:21.203
SCIENTIST LISO GOLDMAN RUSSIA

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:24.706
SO FROM STANFORD. I RECALL I

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.942
ACTUALLY RECALL FORMER GOVERNOR

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.010
JERRY BROWN'S CALLED ARMS TO

01:17:28.076 --> 01:17:29.778
BRING PRECISION MEDICINE. TO

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:32.414
EVERY CALIFORNIANS. WE FOCUSED

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:34.316
ON SALINAS AND MONTEREY COUNTY

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:37.152
WHERE 60% OF THE FOUR HUNDRED

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:37.753
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:41.289
ARE LATINO. PRETTY RATE IS 18%

01:17:41.356 --> 01:17:44.659
16% ARE UNINSURED ONE IN THREE

01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:45.227
IS CONSIDERED OBESE AND 12%

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.063
SMOKE. SO THESE WERE THE

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.464
MARCHING ORDERS THAT I ACTUALLY

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.866
HEARD FROM THE CALL FOR

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:53.769
PROPOSAL FOR THE CIA PM.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.937
INTRODUCED PRECISION MEDICINE

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:56.938
INTERVENTION AND THE LOW INCOME

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:58.974
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. MAKE

01:17:59.041 --> 01:18:01.410
THE STUDY OUTCOMES REPLICABLE

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.545
SHARE THE DATA SHOW THE PROJECT

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.113
TO SAVE THE MONEY AND LIVES

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:06.715
CONSIDER POLICIES THAT MAKE IT

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:09.251
SUSTAINABLE AND ADDRESS

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:09.885
DISPARITIES JUST A SMALL AMOUNT

01:18:09.951 --> 01:18:12.521
OF THINGS. TO DO THAT WE

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.855
DECIDED TO LOOK AT PRECISION

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.424
MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS ACROSS

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.092
THE CONTINUUM FROM PREVENTION

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:18.627
WHICH IS WHERE I BELIEVE IT

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.661
SHOULD START AND NOT IN THE

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.696
FOURTH STAGE TUMOR. OF

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:22.964
PREVENTION EDUCATION AND

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.599
SCREENING THROUGH DIAGNOSIS AND

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.234
TREATMENT THROUGH SURVIVORSHIP

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:29.237
IN END OF LIFE UTILIZING AND

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:30.672
MEASURING THE ADDED VALUE OF

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:32.741
COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS CHW

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.476
WAS WHICH IS ONE ANSWER TO THE

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:36.778
WORK FORCE DIVERSITY PIPELINE.

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:39.214
AT LEAST IN MY ESTIMATION SO WE

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.116
LOOK AT MONTEREY COUNTY SO

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.050
PROFILE WE LOOK AT LATINOS

01:18:42.117 --> 01:18:43.819
AGAINST NON WHITE HIS NON

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.387
HISPANIC WHITES IN TERMS OF

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.589
LONG BREAST COLORECTAL PROSTATE

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:49.124
WHICH IS WHERE THE GRANT ASKED

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.992
US TO FOCUS. AND WE FOUND THE

01:18:51.059 --> 01:18:53.395
LATINOS RANK LOWER IN ALL OF

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.262
THESE CATEGORIES EXCEPT

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.099
PROSTATE CANCER. SO THEN WE

01:18:57.165 --> 01:19:00.302
LOOKED OUTSIDE THE NORM. AND

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:01.203
HERE'S WHAT WE FOUND THE

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.038
DISPARITIES HERE. BESIDES

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:05.774
PROSTATE STOMACH LIVER PANCREAS

01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:08.110
AND CERVIX ALL RANKED HIGHER

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:09.344
NOT JUST IN MONTEREY COUNTY

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.012
AGAINST NON HISPANIC WHITES BUT

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.181
AGAINST ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SO

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:14.783
THIS IS WHERE THE DISPARITIES

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.351
LIE AND THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.586
BE SAMPLING TESTING IN ANY

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:19.821
INTERVENING. YEP THE GENETIC

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:22.124
TESTS PANELS AGAINST WE HAVE TO

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.593

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:26.995
BASED ON MAINSTREAM POPULATIONS

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:28.063
WERE MISSING A GREAT

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.664
OPPORTUNITY HERE. I HAD

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:30.899
TESTIFIED AT THE HEARING AT

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.935
UCLA LAST YEAR THAT IN ORDER TO

01:19:34.002 --> 01:19:35.337
BRING PRECISION MEDICINE TO LOW

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.972
INCOME COMMUNITIES TO ALL OF

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:38.673
CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY NEEDED

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.575
TO GO THROUGH DISPARITIES. AND

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:41.710
WE HAD TO THE DRESS THE SOCIAL

01:19:41.776 --> 01:19:43.612
DETERMINANTS THE BARRIERS LIKE

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.313
LOW INCOME AND LANGUAGE AND

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.115
ACCESS DISPARITIES THAT

01:19:47.182 --> 01:19:49.784
INCLUDED UNDER RESOURCE PUBLIC

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:51.019
HEALTH CARE AND CLINICS SYSTEMS

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:53.255
WHOSE CLINICIANS. ARE EQUALLY

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.023
CHALLENGED BY WHAT TO DO WITH

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:56.625
PRECISION MEDICINE WHERE TO

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:58.693
ORDER TESTS HOW TO UNDERSTAND

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.829
WHAT THEY MEAN HOW TO GET THE

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:02.364
PRESCRIBED TREATMENT HOW TO GET

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:03.865
THE COSTS COVERED BY PAY YOURS

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:06.401
IN INSURERS. AND GIVEN THIS

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:07.202
THESE BARRIERS IN THESE

01:20:07.269 --> 01:20:11.139
CHALLENGE HOW DO WE EVEN BEGAN

01:20:11.206 --> 01:20:12.941
TO DISCOVER THE VARIANCE ORPHAN

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:18.113
GENES THAT MIGHT BE PARTICULAR.

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.614
ELLIS SO THAT WE CAN IN FACT

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:20.148
ADD TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:22.517
TESTING AND DISCOVERY. WHEN THE

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:23.485
PROJECT TEAM LAUNCHED THE FIRST

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:23.985
MEETING OF THE COMMUNITY

01:20:24.052 --> 01:20:25.187
ADVISORY BOARD JUST THIS LAST

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:27.189
FRIDAY IN SALINAS WE DID AN

01:20:27.255 --> 01:20:28.557
INSTANT POLL AND THIS WAS ONE

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:30.158
OF THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED OF

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:30.659
THEM WHAT ARE THE MOST

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.194
IMPORTANT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.596
OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT CANCER IN

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.232
MONTEREY COUNTY. AND THIS WORD

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:38.433
CLOUD IF YOU CAN SEE A G. I

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:38.967
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE

01:20:39.034 --> 01:20:40.769
BIGGER THAN THIS BUT THE YOU'LL

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:42.537
NOTICE THAT ACCESS AND SOCIO

01:20:42.604 --> 01:20:46.007
ECONOMIC OR COST WERE THE TWO

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:48.577
STANDOUTS TWO MAJOR BARRIERS TO

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:50.845
QUALITY INEQUITABLE CARE THAT

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:51.746
IMPACT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS NOT

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:54.316
JUST IN MONTEREY. COUNTY BUT

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:57.252
ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY

01:20:57.319 --> 01:20:58.553
SIXTEEN WHEN I HOSTED THE FIFTH

BI ANNUAL NATIONAL AT THE NO

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.356
CANCER SOME OF THE FOCUS WAS

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.191
PRECISION MEDICINE WE SAW IT

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:04.693
COMING WE KNEW WE HAD TO ENGAGE

01:21:04.759 --> 01:21:06.094
WE DIDN'T. WE WEREN'T QUITE

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.195
SURE WHAT THAT WAS GOING TO

01:21:07.262 --> 01:21:08.897
MEAN FOR OUR POPULATIONS AND

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.198
MOST OF THE THREE HUNDRED

01:21:10.265 --> 01:21:11.266

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:12.968
REPRESENTATIVES WHO WERE THERE

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:15.403
MOST OF THEM 70% LATINO CAME IN

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.305
VERY SKEPTICAL CONCERNED THAT

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:18.240
PRECISION MEDICINE WOULD IN

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.875
FACT INDEED EXACERBATE OUR

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.811
DISPARITIES THEY LEFT WITH A

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:24.613

INCLUDE. THESE APPLICATIONS

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:28.283
WITHIN THEIR WORK BUT THERE'S A

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.152
LONG ROAD BETWEEN INTENTION AND

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.455
POSITIVE OUTCOMES BIOTECHNOLOGY

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.756

CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE PROMISING

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.994
FOR MANY COMMUNITIES IF

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:40.929
CALIFORNIANS UNDERSTAND IT IF

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.798
THEY ACCEPTED IF THEY DON'T

01:21:43.865 --> 01:21:45.667
FEAR IT IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

01:22:08.823 --> 01:22:09.324

ENGAGEMENT PLAN THAT SHOWED

01:22:21.069 --> 01:22:21.603
THEY UNDERSTOOD THE DIVERSITY

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:22.103
OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:22.704
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN ABSENT

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.238
FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:25.173
COMMUNITIES WITH LANGUAGE LOW

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.776

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:30.045
OF RESEARCH. AND AS I AM RE

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.346
REVIEWED SOME OF THESE

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.981
APPLICATIONS IN THEIR SECOND

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.049
AND THIRD YEARS THESE

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.884
APPLICANTS HAVE SHOWN IN FACT

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:36.551
THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED THE HARD

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.286
WAY. THEY HAVE LEARNED TO

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.587
FINALLY REACH INTO THESE

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:42.857

BRIDGES. SO I GOT BOLD AND I

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:49.597
GOT BRILLIANT AND I CAME UP

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:52.167
WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. AT

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.668

01:23:09.651 --> 01:23:12.520
SAY CREATE A PEOPLE FUND FOR

COMMUNITIES TO SUPPORT GAP

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:36.411
EDUCATION BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:39.314
WE START. TEACHING

01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:31.065
BOUGHT INVEST. THE POWER IN THE

01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:32.300
PEOPLE TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.636
WHAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO DO

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:38.773
TO BECOME ENGAGED YOU CANNOT

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.307
HAVE ALL OF THIS BRILLIANT

01:24:39.374 --> 01:24:39.941

I'M DIGESTING THAT EVEN IS AS

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:53.288
WE SPEAK. I GUESS I'M STRUCK

01:24:53.354 --> 01:24:57.091
THAT CREATING A ROBUST

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.294
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PLAN

01:24:59.360 --> 01:24:59.928
SOUNDS LIKE IT OUGHT TO BE A NO

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:04.566
BRAINER. IN THIS DAY AND AGE

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:05.133
BUT DO I LIKE YOU IT SOUNDS

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.070
LIKE IT'S NOT. AND CERTAINLY

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:10.572
THERE'S A THERE'S A DOLLARS

THOSE DOLLARS APPROPRIATELY

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:18.213

THE GENERAL POPULATION AS

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:42.837
OPPOSED TO SAY A LEAD LATINO

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.806
POPULATION A THESE VARIANTS ARE

01:25:44.873 --> 01:25:46.708
ARE TAKEN FROM THE GENERAL

01:25:46.774 --> 01:25:48.743
POPULATION WHICH CAN ACTUALLY

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.345
BE SOMETHING OF A DISADVANTAGE

01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:52.580
IN TERMS OF A WHAT THOSE

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.381
RESULTS MIGHT BE CAN YOU

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:55.817
EXPLAIN THAT JUST. A LITTLE

01:25:55.884 --> 01:25:56.651
MORE SO I COULD BETTER

01:25:56.718 --> 01:25:58.987
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:00.755
AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:03.825
AFFECT THAT AS A LEGISLATURE

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:04.492
OKAY SO NOW YOU'RE ASKING ME TO

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.828
PUT ON A SCIENCE HAND. SO I'M

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:09.597
GOING TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.233
TO CHIME IN IF I MESS UP. OF

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.235
BOTTOM LINE. THE MAJORITY OF

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.537
PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN RESEARCH

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:16.704
DONE ON HOME WE HAVE

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.139
INFORMATION ARE ARE NON

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:20.041
HISPANIC WHITE. SO WE HAVE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:22.544
UNDER OF RESEARCH COMMUNITIES

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:23.978
AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:26.281
ASIAN OF. POPULATIONS AND IN

01:26:26.347 --> 01:26:27.782
FACT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.017
THAT THE ALL OF US RESEARCH

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:31.386
PROGRAM WAS MEANT TO ADDRESS IT

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.654
WAS TO IN FACT BRING IN THESE

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:35.590
LARGE GROUPS OF UNDER RESEARCH

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.592
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF. WE

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.027
KNEW WE WERE GONNA LEARN MORE

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.929
FROM THEM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

01:26:40.995 --> 01:26:43.064
TO TREAT BROADER A SCOPE OF

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:44.599
DISEASES. INSTEAD OF JUST

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.634
DEPENDENT ON THESE PARTICULAR

01:26:46.701 --> 01:26:48.503
I'M NOT SAYING THERE AREN'T

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:49.571
THERE ISN'T DATA OUT THERE I

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.439
READ SOME LAB IS GOT SOMETHING

01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:54.475
LIKE A- FIVE CONTINENTS AND-

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:58.880
SIX HUNDRED KINDS. THEY HAVE A

01:26:58.947 --> 01:26:59.914
LAB FULL OF PEOPLE'S AS

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:00.615
SAMPLES. BUT WHERE WE'RE

01:27:00.682 --> 01:27:02.317
TESTING. AND WHAT WE'RE TESTING

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.152
AGAINST THEY HAVE LIMITED

01:27:04.218 --> 01:27:05.787
SAMPLES AND THOSE SAMPLES ARE

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:08.022
TAKEN FROM NON HISPANIC WHITES

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.857
MORE TRADITIONALLY SO I'M

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:11.392
SAYING IF THERE ARE DIFFERENCES

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.661
IN DISEASES. OR DIFFERENT OR

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.597
DISEASES THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT%

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:18.199
MORE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:18.800
HOW DO WE FIND THAT OUT IF WE

01:27:18.866 --> 01:27:22.904
CAN'T MEASURE. OUR TO SELL OUR

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.139
BIO SPECIMENS AGAINST OF

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:26.374
AGAINST THE POPULAR UP THE

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.876
POPULATION WHERE THE CELLS OF

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:29.611
AND THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:32.046
THE DATA YOU HAVE. SO IT'S JUST

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:32.647
SAYING WE'RE TRYING TO LEVEL

01:27:32.714 --> 01:27:34.649
THE PLAYING FIELD OF KNOWLEDGE

01:27:34.716 --> 01:27:36.217
SO THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:39.220
TO THE RIGHT ANSWERS I THINK

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:39.821
RENDON HAS DONE A LOT OF THAT

01:27:39.887 --> 01:27:41.422
WORK AND POSSIBLY EVEN. ADD

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:44.826
SOMETHING SMART. I'M NOT A

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:45.660
GENETICIST SO I DON'T SPEAK OUT

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:46.794
OF TURN I THINK IN GENERAL

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:47.629
YOU'RE SAYING THE NORMATIVE

01:27:47.695 --> 01:27:49.063
SENT SAMPLES MAY NOT BE

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:51.099
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GENERAL.

01:27:51.165 --> 01:27:51.666
POPULATION SEE I TOLD YOU HE

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:55.103
WOULD SAY. DID DID I MAKE ANY

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:56.004
SENSE TO YOU. MISTER MILLER.

01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:58.072
WITH SEVEN SO THAT I MAKE ANY

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:58.673
SENSE TO YOU YES YOU DID OKAY

THAT I INTRODUCED MY COLLEAGUES

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:04.779
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BILL QUIRK FROM

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.748
THE EAST BAY. LONG STANDING

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:07.982
MEMBER OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE

01:28:08.049 --> 01:28:10.084
ABOUT TECH WOULD WELCOME ANY

01:28:10.151 --> 01:28:15.857
COMMENTS AT THE OUTSET. WELL

01:28:15.923 --> 01:28:17.091
CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE OF THE

01:28:17.158 --> 01:28:21.562
MOST EXCITING. FIELDS AND- IN A

01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:24.899
REAL IMPORTANT SUPPORT. OF OUR

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:27.969
BAY AREA COMMUNITY SAN DIEGO LA

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.338
AT CETERA. I IS THIS BIOTECH

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:34.509
INDUSTRY. HAS A LOT TO GIVE US

01:28:34.575 --> 01:28:39.480
I'M CERTAINLY AWARE. THAT AS

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:42.684
YOU WERE DISCUSSING THAT. OUR

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:45.053
GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS VARY A

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.587
LOT IF YOU TAKE THEM FROM ONE

01:28:46.654 --> 01:28:49.223
PARTICULAR GROUP IT MAY NOT BE

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:49.957
APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER GROUP

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:54.028
SHALL WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:54.629
DIFFERENCES I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:55.229
TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT. THANK

01:28:55.296 --> 01:28:59.133
YOU. AS DOCTOR BILL QUIRK

01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.135
LITERALLY A NUCLEAR SCIENTIST

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:01.736
AND OFFICIALLY ASTROPHYSICISTS

01:29:01.803 --> 01:29:06.140
ARE. I KNEW IT I KNEW SOMETHING

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.576
LIKE THAT I KNOW NUCLEAR SIGN.

01:29:08.643 --> 01:29:10.878
AND ROCKET SCIENCE SO ON THE

01:29:10.945 --> 01:29:16.451
ISSUE DOCTOR AS SPIEGEL OF. BOB

01:29:16.517 --> 01:29:20.588
DIGITAL MONITORING. IN AN

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:22.390
ESSENTIALLY AT YOU DIDN'T PUT

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.292
IN THESE TERMS ABOUT PREVENTING

01:29:24.358 --> 01:29:25.359
FOLKS FROM GOING TO THE

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:26.294
HOSPITAL BUT ESSENTIALLY

01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:27.662
THERE'S THIS TRACK OVER HERE

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:30.131
WHICH IS DIGITAL MODERATE

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:30.732
REMOTE MONITORING OR GOING IN

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:35.136
THIS YEAR. AMERICAN POSITION.

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:38.740
WHO MAKES THE CALL. ON WHETHER

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:41.075
SOMETHING CAN BE HANDLED

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:45.346
REMOTELY OR ITS- THE KIND OF

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:45.947
HEALTH SITUATION THAT OUGHT TO

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:49.617
BE SEEN BY A. DR THE PERSON

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:51.886
RIGHT SO I THINK WITH PARTLY

01:29:51.953 --> 01:29:53.821
BEHIND THE QUESTION IS DIGITAL

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.022
HEALTH IS NOT A COMPUTER

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:56.023
SCIENCE IS NOT AN ENGINEERING

01:29:56.090 --> 01:29:57.425
SCIENCE IT'S REALLY A SOCIAL

01:29:57.492 --> 01:29:58.526
SCIENCE AT THE BEHAVIORAL

01:29:58.593 --> 01:30:00.294
SCIENCE AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.796
IS TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TO

01:30:01.863 --> 01:30:02.530
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:04.665
TECHNOLOGY. REQUIRE SHARED

01:30:04.732 --> 01:30:06.033
DECISION MAKING BETWEEN

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.869
PATIENTS AND THEIR PROVIDERS IT

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:10.238
ALSO REQUIRES HAVING PROGRAMS

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:11.806
THAT ARE RELIABLE THEIR

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:13.441
EVIDENCE BASE AND THAT ARE COST

01:30:13.508 --> 01:30:14.575
EFFECTIVE SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:16.277
ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO

01:30:16.344 --> 01:30:17.345
EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:19.280
TODAY THAT HAVE TO PHONE LINE

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.882
FOR ANY DECISION TO BE MADE.

01:30:20.948 --> 01:30:22.083
NOW WHERE MOST OF THE DECISIONS

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:23.818
ARE BEING MADE IS AROUND HI

01:30:23.885 --> 01:30:24.886
PROBLEMS CONDITIONS LIKE

01:30:24.952 --> 01:30:27.288
DIABETES LIKE A HEART DISEASE

01:30:27.355 --> 01:30:29.023
EXAMPLE THAT I PROVIDED TODAY

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:31.159
OR FOR HIGH STAKES SITUATIONS

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:33.161
LIKE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTED FOR

01:30:33.227 --> 01:30:35.263
TRANSPLANTATION OR REALLY

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:37.298
UNDERSTANDING THEY'RE- NOT JUST

01:30:37.365 --> 01:30:38.499
DAY TO DAY BUT SOME CASES

01:30:38.566 --> 01:30:40.268
MINUTES MINUTE VARIATIONS ARE

01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:42.069
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CLINICAL

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:45.006
CARE. SO AT THIS POINT WE DON'T

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:46.207
HAVE A SYSTEMATIC ANSWERED YOUR

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:47.975
QUESTION IT'S REALLY STILL IN

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:48.943
EXPERIMENTAL PURSUIT ALTHOUGH

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.711
WE HAVE SO MUCH EVIDENCE NOW

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.246
THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS

01:30:52.313 --> 01:30:53.881
THE QUESTION IS EXACTLY HOW

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:55.483
SHOULD WE BE DOING THIS WHO'S

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.117
IN CHARGE OF MAKING THIS THESE

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.652
DECISIONS SO NOT REALLY

01:30:57.718 --> 01:30:59.387
ANSWERING A QUESTION I DON'T

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:01.522
THINK DIRECTLY. OTHER THAN

01:31:01.589 --> 01:31:03.391
POSING MORE QUESTIONS WHICH

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:04.392
MAYBE IS A SIGN OF A QUESTION I

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:07.395
THINK THERE'S A LOT A LOT

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:07.995
ANSWER TO REALLY ADDRESS YOUR

01:31:08.062 --> 01:31:14.035
QUESTION. AND I WILL. POSE TO

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.036
YOU. DOCTOR SPIEGEL A SIMILAR

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:16.337
QUESTION AROUND LEGAL

01:31:16.404 --> 01:31:16.938
REGULATORY BARRIERS MEAN THE-

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:17.438
VERY CLEARLY THERE IS A

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.473
FINANCIAL COMPONENT HERE AND P.

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:22.410
R. THE STATE. IS STEPPING UP.

01:31:22.476 --> 01:31:23.377
THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE A

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.245
PARTNER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.180
ON THIS. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:31:26.247 --> 01:31:28.449
HEAR FROM OUR NEXT PANEL ABOUT.

01:31:28.516 --> 01:31:29.750
IS THE INDUSTRY AND FRANKLY

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.953
ECONOMIC AND INNOVATION

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.688
OPPORTUNITIES HERE IN THIS

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:36.958
SECTOR. WHICH IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.292
WE AS A LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:42.363
ENABLE. YOU ALL TO DO THE WORK

01:31:42.430 --> 01:31:43.464
THAT YOU DO OR TAKE THIS TO THE

01:31:43.531 --> 01:31:46.500
NEXT STEP. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

01:31:46.567 --> 01:31:48.236
THINGS THAT WE OUGHT TO BE.

01:31:48.302 --> 01:31:49.737
FOCUSING ON A MATTER FIRST

01:31:49.804 --> 01:31:51.572
PANEL FRANKLY. AND THIS DOESN'T

01:31:51.639 --> 01:31:52.773
ALWAYS HAPPEN IN THESE HEARINGS

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:53.541
BUT THERE ARE VERY CLEARLY A

01:31:53.608 --> 01:31:55.910
COUPLE OF LEGISLATIVE IDEAS.

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.612
THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN WORK ON

01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:00.314
ACTIVELY AND MOVE. BUT WHAT ARE

01:32:00.381 --> 01:32:01.749
SOME OF THE THINGS JUST FROM

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:04.185
YOUR- PERSPECTIVE THAT WE OUGHT

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:08.256
TO BE. MORE COGNIZANT OF IN

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:09.790
TERMS OF BARRIERS THAT EXISTS

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.392
IN OUR STATE. SO MANY BARRIERS

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:13.127
ANY PART OF IT. IT'S HARD FOR

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.296
ME TO KNOW. LEGISLATIVELY HOW

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:16.330
TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN SOME

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:17.565
OF IT IS REGULATORY REALLY

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:21.435
MORE. FEDERAL FDA CLEARANCE OF

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:22.069
DEVICES FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS A

01:32:22.136 --> 01:32:24.171
BIG ISSUE THAT MANY OF THE-

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:25.806
COMPANIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:27.742
ARE STRUGGLING WITH A WE A

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:31.145
HEALTH AND WELLNESS COMPANY. OR

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.213
RE TRYING TO CREATE MEDICAL

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:35.283
GRADE PRODUCTS AND COMPANIES

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:35.750
ARE REALLY DIVIDING UP

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:42.256
INSTITUTE. IT REALLY HELPS. TO

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:43.224
LIVE FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANY FDA

01:32:43.291 --> 01:32:44.258
CLEARED APPLE SOMEWHERE IN

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:44.892
BETWEEN WITH FTA CLEAR DEVICES

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:45.526
SO PART OF IT IS REALLY FEDERAL

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.161
REGULATIONS MAKING IT EASIER TO

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:49.497
OBTAIN CLEARANCE WITH PREDICATE

01:32:49.563 --> 01:32:50.665
DEVICES AND THERE'S A WHOLE.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:51.699
THERE'S A WHOLE SORT OF

01:32:51.766 --> 01:32:52.566
LITERATURE AROUND HOW BEST TO

01:32:52.633 --> 01:32:54.135
APPROACH THAT. WITHIN

01:32:54.201 --> 01:32:55.369
CALIFORNIA I THINK WHAT WE NEED

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:57.605
TO THINK ABOUT IS AS REALLY

01:32:57.672 --> 01:32:59.206
TRAINING PEOPLE FOR THIS NEW

01:32:59.273 --> 01:33:01.409
REALITY. WHETHER IT'S IN

01:33:01.475 --> 01:33:03.177
MEDICAL SCHOOLS DO WE NEED A

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:04.578
NEW TYPE OF DISCIPLINE DO WE

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:05.947
NEED TO TRAIN DIGITAL LIST OF

01:33:06.013 --> 01:33:07.782
ANY CHANGE THE CURRICULUM. IN

01:33:07.848 --> 01:33:11.085
THE UC SYSTEM I HAPPENED TO RUN

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:12.720
A GRADUATE PROGAM FOCUSED

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:14.055
EXACTLY ON THIS TOPIC WE

01:33:14.121 --> 01:33:15.356
ACTUALLY ARE TRAINING

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:16.424
TOMORROW'S HEALTHCARE LEADERS

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:19.894
IN THE NEW ERA. OF DIGITAL

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:21.495
HEALTH AND ALSO COMBINING IT

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:22.363
WITH KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEALTH

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.397
ECONOMICS UNDERSTANDING THE

01:33:23.464 --> 01:33:25.533
POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF NEW

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:26.500
TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.569
THERE'S- A LITERACY GAP IN THAT

01:33:28.636 --> 01:33:30.037
AREA WE DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:31.272
PEOPLE TRAINED UNDERSTAND

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:32.773
POLICY. UNDERSTAND HEALTH

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.208
ECONOMICS AND UNDERSTAND THE

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:35.543
SCIENCE AND BRING THEM ALL

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:37.411
TOGETHER TO REALLY MAKE SMART

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:39.213
DECISIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS AND

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:39.747
THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.182
TRYING TO DO WITH OUR MASTER'S

01:33:41.248 --> 01:33:44.785
DEGREE PROGRAM. BUT I WISH I

01:33:44.852 --> 01:33:45.386
HAD A MORE PRECISE ANSWER YOUR

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:50.858
QUESTION. NOT I WELCOME IT AND

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:52.360
IT'S- YOU KNOW MUCH OF THIS IS

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:52.927
NEW EMERGING INFORMATION I'M

01:33:52.994 --> 01:33:54.261
I'M TRYING TO. LEARN AS MUCH AS

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:56.664
I CAN I MENTION TO A GROUP. WHO

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:57.698
WAS HERE EARLIER THIS IS VERY

01:33:57.765 --> 01:34:00.167
MUCH YEAH WE ARE GENERALISTS

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:01.602
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

01:34:01.669 --> 01:34:03.237
ASTROPHYSICIST WHERE ARE OFTEN

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.740
GENERALISTS. IT IS BUILDING.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:07.942
AND THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:10.077
GAP ON THAT SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE.

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:12.046
THE FRONT ANSWER TRANSLATING

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.748
THAT INTO YOU KNOW HOW DO WE

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.049
TURN THIS INTO PUBLIC POLICY

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:16.717
THAT CAN MOVE THESE THINGS.

01:34:16.784 --> 01:34:20.354
FORWARD AND IT IT JUST OBSTRUCT

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:20.955
YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION AROUND

01:34:21.022 --> 01:34:24.425

DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND SO

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:27.561
FOR JUST THAT THE- THE-

01:34:27.628 --> 01:34:29.463
GEOGRAPHY OF CALIFORNIA ALONE

01:34:29.530 --> 01:34:31.432
PRESENTS. CHALLENGES IN THIS

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:34.301
REGARD AND- RURAL HEALTH CARE

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:37.538
AND WORK FORCE ARE ISSUES THAT

THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:46.313
MINDFUL OF THE DIVERSITY OF

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.883
CALIFORNIA NATALIE ETHNICALLY

01:34:48.949 --> 01:34:50.985
CULTURALLY GEOGRAPHICALLY. JUST

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:52.253
OUR SERVICE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:54.121
WHICH MAKE CALIFORNIA'S A

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:55.089
RICHER ACTUALLY SOME OF THE

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:56.857
THINGS THAT ALSO. A PREVENT

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.092
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF SERVICE

01:34:58.159 --> 01:35:01.228
DELIVERY AND WE OUGHT TO BE

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:02.296
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TAKE

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:05.266
ALL OF THAT. INTO ACCOUNT TO

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.334
MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.070
FOR EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:11.138
ITSELF. I THANK YOU BOTH FOR

01:35:11.205 --> 01:35:13.240
YOUR YES YES I THINK THIS IS

01:35:13.307 --> 01:35:14.909
REALLY CRUCIAL BECAUSE THIS.

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:16.077
MIGHT AT SOME POINT IN TIME

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.045
ALSO GO TO REGULATION AND OTHER

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:18.946
POLICIES THAT YOU'RE GOING TO

01:35:19.013 --> 01:35:20.481
HAVE TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE WE'RE

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:22.283
LOOKING AT IT FROM THE SCIENCE

01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:23.918
SIDE BUT WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS GO

01:35:23.984 --> 01:35:24.652
BACK AND LOOK AT IT FROM THE

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.554
CONSUMER COMMUNITY SIDE. THERE

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.789
IS EVEN FROM MY CHAIR AT THE I.

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.357
R. B. WITH THERE IS A GROWING

01:35:30.424 --> 01:35:31.892
CONSUMER MOVEMENT ABOUT WHO

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:34.395
OWNS MY DATA. AND WHO HAS

01:35:34.462 --> 01:35:36.363
PERMISSION TO USE MY DATA AND

01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:37.765
WHEN THEY USE IT WHAT DO I GET

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:41.235
FROM IT. AND SO I MEAN THERE'S

01:35:41.302 --> 01:35:41.802
EVEN AN ORGANIZATION CALLED

01:35:41.869 --> 01:35:43.370
CITIZENS WHICH IS DEEP TEACHING

01:35:43.437 --> 01:35:45.306
PEOPLE HOW TO GET CONTROL OF

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:47.308
THEIR DATA AND WHAT THEYCAN DO

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.909
WITH IT. OF AND OF COURSE FIRST

01:35:48.976 --> 01:35:50.911
QUESTION IS ALWAYS DO YOU HAVE

01:35:50.978 --> 01:35:54.181
THAT IN SPANISH BUT- I THINK

01:35:54.248 --> 01:35:59.420
THAT. YOU IS LEGISLATORS. NEED

01:35:59.487 --> 01:36:00.020
TO BE THAT CONSUMERS ARE START

01:36:00.087 --> 01:36:05.326
IN. GIVEN ALL OF THE EXPOSURES

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:08.562
GIVEN. PACKING GIVEN EVERYTHING

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:09.730
THE CONSUMERS SHINS ADVOCATES

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:10.898
ALL BECOMING VERY WHERE THAT

01:36:10.965 --> 01:36:12.333
THEIR DATA IS VALUABLE AND

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:13.334
WHAT'S IN IT THEY WHAT'S IN IT

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:13.934
FOR ME SYNDROME YES THEY WANT

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.102
TO HELP BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:16.971
CONTROL TO SOME EXTENT SO HOW

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:19.140
ARE WE GOING TO CREATE THAT

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:19.740
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM SO WE'RE

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:22.076
GOING TO HAVE. SO WE'RE GOING

01:36:22.143 --> 01:36:22.676
TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT CONSENT

01:36:22.743 --> 01:36:26.247
IN. AND CONSENT IN AT EVERY

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:28.616
STEP OF THE WAY AND NOT JUST

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:30.351
ONE SIGN OFF OF TEN PAGES OF

01:36:30.417 --> 01:36:32.486
MEDICAL JARGON IT'S REALLY

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:33.053
CRUCIAL TO START THINKING ON

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:36.157
THAT LEVEL. THAT COURT JUST TO

01:36:36.223 --> 01:36:38.192
THAT EFFECT NOW WE'VE HD A

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:40.361
CELL LINE THAT WAS DEVELOPED

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:43.030
WAY BACK WHEN IN THE SIXTIES.

01:36:43.097 --> 01:36:44.431
AND THE WOMAN NEVER KNEW THAT

01:36:44.498 --> 01:36:46.233
ARE CELLS WERE TAKEN THAT THEY

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:48.769
WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.272
HENRIETTA LACKS YES EXACTLY

01:36:51.338 --> 01:36:52.373
WOMAN NEVER KNEW THAT OUR

01:36:52.439 --> 01:36:54.141
SHELLS WERE TAKEN. HER

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:57.044
DESCENDANTS THAN SOME FIFTY

01:36:57.111 --> 01:37:00.748
YEARS LATER BEING TOLD THAT

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:01.348
THEY WERE TAKEN HAVE THEY WERE

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:04.685
USED AND. IF YOU'RE NOT USED TO

01:37:04.752 --> 01:37:06.120
SCIENCE THIS IS VERY DISTURBING

01:37:06.187 --> 01:37:10.457
SO. YOU KNOW THE RIGHT TO YOUR

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:13.527
BODY WHICH CAN BE SAMPLED AND

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:14.328
PERHAPS IS IMPORTANT FOR

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.830
SCIENCE. YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO

01:37:16.897 --> 01:37:22.102
HAVE. A VERY STRONG CONSENT AND

01:37:22.169 --> 01:37:22.836
THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION IF

01:37:22.903 --> 01:37:24.638
SOMEBODY'S MAKING MONEY OFF IT

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:26.974
DO YOU GET MONEY BACK. THESE

01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:29.009
ARE ALL QUESTIONS THAT THAT

01:37:29.076 --> 01:37:31.045
PEOPLE NEED TO GET ANSWERS TO

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:32.179
AND THAT WAS WHY PROPOSED THE

01:37:32.246 --> 01:37:34.915
PEOPLE FUND NOT SO PART OF THE

01:37:34.982 --> 01:37:36.850
ANY OF THE WE GOT ALL THE

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:38.919
REVENUES OR ANYTHING IT'S GOING

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:40.154
TO COME BACK TO THE PEOPLE SO

01:37:40.221 --> 01:37:41.689
THAT THEY CAN ALSO DECIDE WHAT

AWARENESS WE THINK THIS BODY

01:43:50.757 --> 01:43:51.925
FOR SUPPORTING THE SENATE

01:44:23.857 --> 01:44:25.492
THE DISEASE HAVE NOT ADVANCED

01:44:25.559 --> 01:44:27.294
IN DECADES. SO THE TOOLS THAT

01:44:27.361 --> 01:44:29.062
DO EXIST TEND TO REMAIN IN THE

01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:31.732
RESEARCH DOMAIN AND FEW OF THEM

01:44:31.798 --> 01:44:33.433
MAKE IT INTO THE CLINIC OR VIEW

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.103
OF THE MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:40.540
THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS. MS

01:44:40.607 --> 01:44:41.308
PATIENTS ALSO TEND TO VISIT

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.175
THEIR NEUROLOGIST. PERHAPS ONCE

01:44:42.242 --> 01:44:43.944
OR TWICE A YEARSOMETIMES FOR

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.846
FIFTEEN MINUTES SO I GIVE THE

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:46.513
NEUROLOGIST LIMITATION AND

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.081
REALLY APPRECIATING THE FULL

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:50.250
SCOPE. OF THEIR FUNCTIONING THE

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.251
FULL SCOPE OF HOW THIS DISEASE

01:44:51.318 --> 01:44:53.887
IMPACT THEIR LIFE. SO IN

01:44:53.954 --> 01:44:54.488
RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:57.057
ARE TEAM AFTER SELVES. WHAT IF

01:44:57.124 --> 01:44:58.792
WE COULD BETTER DETECT EARLY

01:44:58.859 --> 01:44:59.793
SIGNS OF PROGRESSION BEFORE

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.962
PATIENT BECOMES DISABLED. WHAT

01:45:02.029 --> 01:45:03.830
IF WE COULD CAPTURE CHANGES IN

01:45:03.897 --> 01:45:05.432
COORDINATION OR WALKING ABILITY

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:07.167
BEFORE THAT PATIENT MIGHT NEED.

01:45:07.234 --> 01:45:09.536
A CANE OR WALKER OR EVEN A

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:13.407
WHEELCHAIR. SO THIS INFORMATION

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.207
WHAT'S SUPPORT PROVIDER TO

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:16.043
RECOGNIZE PROGRESSION IT WOULD

01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:16.476
GIVE THEM A GREATER

01:45:16.543 --> 01:45:18.945
UNDERSTANDING AND THEY PERHAPS

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:19.880
SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TO PURSUE

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:21.715
THE BEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE.

01:45:21.782 --> 01:45:22.783
THIRTY CHRIS SEDATE TALKED

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.051
ABOUT DIGITAL TOOLS IN THE

01:45:24.117 --> 01:45:25.619
PROMISE OF THESE TOOLS SO I

01:45:25.686 --> 01:45:27.387
THINK THIS TOPIC IS TIMELY

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:28.889
DIGITAL MEDICINE REFERS TO THE

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.357
TOOLS THAT SUPPORT HEALTH

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:31.491
RSEARCH BUT ALSO THE PRACTICE

01:45:31.558 --> 01:45:33.460
OF MEDICINE. THESE TOOLS CAN BE

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:34.561
ADMINISTERED THROUGH A SMART

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:38.565
WATCH SMARTPHONE OR OTHER

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.166
WEARABLES THAT WITHOUT REALLY

01:45:39.232 --> 01:45:42.602
ARE TODAY. LATE IN THE DIGITAL

01:45:42.669 --> 01:45:44.171
TOOLS AN ACT THAT'S AND

01:45:44.237 --> 01:45:44.705
RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT IT'S

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:46.039
DELIVERED ON A SMARTPHONE. AND

01:45:46.106 --> 01:45:47.574
IT'S DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND

01:45:47.641 --> 01:45:49.109
MASS RELATED DISEASE

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.844
PROGRESSION AND DISABILITY OVER

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:52.979
TIME. IT'S DESIGNED TO DO THIS

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:55.115
IN BETWEEN CLINIC VISITS TO

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:55.849
GIVE PATIENTS A BETTER

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:56.983
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR OWN

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.852
DISEASE. AND GIVE THE PATIENT

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.053
THE ABILITY TO TRACK THEIR OWN

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.755
I MUST OVER TIME. AND SHARE

01:46:01.822 --> 01:46:03.123
THEIR RESULTS WITH WHOM THEY'D

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:05.492
LIKE TO THERE COULD BE THEIR

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:06.093
HEALTHCARE TEAM IT COULD BE

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:07.360
THEIR PROVIDER CAN BE THERE

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:09.096
CARE PARTNERS. IN A FEW MINUTES

01:46:09.162 --> 01:46:10.263
FOR MY CHIPS CAN BE USED TO

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:12.199
MEASURE COGNITION UPPER CHARITY

01:46:12.265 --> 01:46:14.401
FUNCTION IN WALKING. THESE ARE

01:46:14.468 --> 01:46:15.836
FUNCTIONS THAT WERE CHOSEN TO

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:16.803
MEASURE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:18.872
IMPACTED BY A MASS. THE REALLY

01:46:18.939 --> 01:46:19.973
IMPORTANT FOR THE DOCTOR TO

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:22.175
MEASURE THEIR FEASIBLY MEASURED

01:46:22.242 --> 01:46:23.477
BY THE DEVICE AND THEY'RE VERY

01:46:23.543 --> 01:46:25.178
IMPORTANT OF PATIENTS WHEN WE

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.814
SEE DECLINES IN THESE AREAS.

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:30.217
THOSE ARE THE PATIENTS THE TEND

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:31.451
TO LEAVE THE WORK FORCE FOR

01:46:31.518 --> 01:46:34.087
EXAMPLE. OBVIOUS YOUR HAND

01:46:34.154 --> 01:46:36.256
FUNCTION. TO THE- THAT'S A RISK

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:36.857
FOR WHO MIGHT AND THEN HAVE

01:46:36.923 --> 01:46:41.228
PROBLEMS ON THE JOB. AND MAY

01:46:41.294 --> 01:46:41.795
AND MAY THEN HAVE HAVE MORE

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:46.433
PROBLEMS WORKING. THERE OVER A

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.033
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AT

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:48.335
LEAST HEALTH RELATED APPS. VERY

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:49.302
FEW OF THEM MAKE IT FROM

01:46:49.369 --> 01:46:50.871
DEVELOPMENT IN THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:53.240
SECTOR. INTO A CLINIC. THE

01:46:53.306 --> 01:46:55.342
TECHNOLOGIES COURSE MUST SOLVED

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:57.444
A PROBLEM FOR THE PATIENT. BUT

01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.979
THEY ALSO MUST SOLVE A PROBLEM

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.814
FOR THE WORK FORCE OR THE WORK

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:03.383
FLOW OF A PROVIDER. AND ALSO

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:06.319
HEALTH SYSTEM. SO THAT THE

01:47:06.386 --> 01:47:08.088
OPPORTUNITY FOR GENENTECH AS WE

01:47:08.155 --> 01:47:10.423
DEVELOP THIS APP. TO PARTNER

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:11.558
WITH CENTER HEALTH OF THIS

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:16.296
PROJECT. REALLY ALLOWS FOR US.

01:47:16.363 --> 01:47:17.764
TO WORK AS TWO TEAMS TO CO

01:47:17.831 --> 01:47:19.432
CREATE THE SOLUTION. AND

01:47:19.499 --> 01:47:20.500
PERHAPS ENSURE THAT THIS

01:47:20.567 --> 01:47:23.670
TECHNOLOGY CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY

01:47:23.737 --> 01:47:27.440
INTEGRATED INTO REAL WORLD CARE.

01:47:27.507 --> 01:47:28.108
HEALTH IS MADE REALLY

01:47:28.175 --> 01:47:28.575
INCREDIBLE STRIDES IN

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:30.177
INCORPORATING TECHNOLOGY TO

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:31.912
IMPROVE NEUROLOGY CARE THEY'VE

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:32.913
DEVELOPED A PLATFORM THAT'S

01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:34.548
CALLED NEURO SHARE AND IT'S

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:35.816
REALLY IT'S SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:38.685
A ONE STOP VISUALIZATION. OF

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:40.353
THE INFORMATION A DOCTOR NEEDS

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:42.422
TO MAKE A DECISION IT MIGHT

01:47:42.489 --> 01:47:44.057
HAVE THEIR BRAIN MRI MIGHT HAVE

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.326
THEIR TREATMENT RESULTS AND THE

01:47:46.393 --> 01:47:47.761
VISION IS THAT BLOOD LIKE DATA

01:47:47.828 --> 01:47:48.495
CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THAT

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:49.963
PLATFORM. SO THAT AFTER CAN

01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:51.631
MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON

01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:55.502
CLINICAL DATA DIAGNOSTIC DATA

01:47:55.569 --> 01:47:56.102
BUT ALSO PATIENT CENTERED REAL

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:59.573
WORLD DATA. ULTIMATELY THIS

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:00.707
COULD PROVIDE A MORE HOLISTIC

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:01.908
VIEW. IT BECOMES A MODEL FOR

01:48:01.975 --> 01:48:03.543
BETTER DATA IT'S NOT. BETTER

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:04.945
DATA IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN

01:48:05.011 --> 01:48:07.247
MORE DATA IT'S REALLY MAKING

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:09.416
THAT DATA MORNING MEANINGFUL.

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:10.550
OUR FIRST STEP IN THE PROGRAM

01:48:10.617 --> 01:48:11.418
WAS TO INTEGRATE INTO THE

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:13.186
CLINIC AND GET FEEDBACK WE

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:15.055
NEEDED TO HEAR FROM PATIENTS

01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:17.390
WHETHER WORDS WAS THIS TOOL

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:18.792
REASONABLE WHETHER FEASIBLE WAS

01:48:18.859 --> 01:48:22.162
IT ACCEPTABLE. WE WANTED TO

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:23.864
MAKE SURE WE COULD ENSURE THAT

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:25.999
PATIENTS UNDERSTOOD THE WHY.

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.267
WHY WOULD WE WANT YOU TO DO

01:48:27.334 --> 01:48:29.502
THIS THE HOUSE BEHIND THE TOOL

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:31.004
AND WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT

01:48:31.071 --> 01:48:31.972
THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:33.673
NEUROLOGIST AS WELL. SO THE CI

01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:35.909
A PM PROVIDED THE FUNDING TO

01:48:35.976 --> 01:48:38.645
DEVELOP AND TEST NUR SHARE AND

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:39.446
ALSO TO START TO INTEGRATE

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.615
FLOOD LIGHT INTO THIS PICTURE.

01:48:41.681 --> 01:48:43.183
THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLOOD LIGHT

01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:44.718
IS SUPPORTED BY A GLOBAL

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:46.586
PROGRAM AND RUSHED IN AND TACK

01:48:46.653 --> 01:48:48.088
IT'S ACTIVE IN MORE THAN THIRTY

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:51.024
COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF OUR OWN

01:48:51.091 --> 01:48:51.825
CLINICAL TRIALS. TO FULLY

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:55.328
VALIDATE ALL THE PARTNERSHIP

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:55.862
WAS THAT OUR HEALTH IS THE

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:56.396
FIRST COLLABORATION IN THE

01:48:56.463 --> 01:49:00.166
WORLD. A TEST THE VALUE OF THIS

01:49:00.233 --> 01:49:01.201
TOOL SO AT THE END OF THE DAY.

01:49:01.268 --> 01:49:02.168
WELL NO NOT ONLY THAT THIS TEST

01:49:02.235 --> 01:49:02.669
IS VALID. BUT THAT IT'S

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:05.272
RELEVANT RIGHT AND SO. THESE

01:49:05.338 --> 01:49:06.740
ARE THE TYPES OF INITIATIVES

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:07.908
NECESSARY TO BRING AN

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:09.676
INNOVATIVE PILOT. INTO A

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:11.811
SCALABLE HEALTH CARE SOLUTION.

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.780
THIS COLLABORATION WAS BEEN

01:49:13.847 --> 01:49:14.314
CONSIDERED BY OUR GLOBAL

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:15.582
ORGANIZATION AS A BEST

01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:19.219
PRACTICE. IT BRINGS TOGETHER

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:22.289
INDUSTRY HEALTH SYSTEMS IN

01:49:22.355 --> 01:49:22.856
ACADEMIA TO CREATE A BESTING

01:49:22.923 --> 01:49:26.760
CLASS HEALTH. HERE IN

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:28.862
CALIFORNIA. AT GENENTECH WE

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:30.230
IMPROVE HOW WE MEASURE DISEASE

01:49:30.297 --> 01:49:30.830
THAT IMPROVES OUR OWN ABILITY

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:31.865
ABILITY TO DO SMARTER MORE

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.133
EFFICIENT RESEARCH AND

01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.801
DEVELOPMENT. TO DEVELOP THE

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:35.936
POTENTIAL MEDICINES TO TREAT

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:37.904
DISEASE BUT IF WE CAN IMPROVE

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:39.506
MEASURES OF DISEASE IN A WAY

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:40.974
THAT COULD ALSO BE INTEGRATED

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.209
INTO CARE. IT HOLDS THE PROMISE

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:45.378
OF IMPROVING THOSE. LIVES OF

01:49:45.445 --> 01:49:48.114
INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. MS

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:49.015
OF THE DIFFICULT DISEASE FOR

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:51.451
ANY INDIVIDUAL TO BEAR. AND THE

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.386
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH

01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:55.088
LEADING HEALTH SYSTEMS HERE IN

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:56.489
CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MADE

01:49:56.556 --> 01:49:58.925
POSSIBLE FOR BY THE CIA PM. AS

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:01.127
ADVANCED OUR OWN ABILITY TO DO

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:03.830
NOW IT PATIENTS NEED NEXT. SO

01:50:03.897 --> 01:50:05.532
WE CONTINUE TO AND INNOVATE ON

01:50:05.598 --> 01:50:07.300
THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:07.767
FOR SERIOUS AND LIFE

01:50:07.834 --> 01:50:08.802
THREATENING CONDITIONS. AND

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:11.137
ADVANCED TOOL TO UNDERSTAND

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:13.073
THESE CONDITIONS. DIGITAL

01:50:13.139 --> 01:50:15.208
HEALTH SOLUTIONS PROMISED TO

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.776
CHANGE THE WAY HEALTHCARE IS

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:18.611
DELIVERED AND OF COURSE ACCESS

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:22.582
TO THESE MISSIONS. IT IN AN

01:50:22.649 --> 01:50:26.353
MORE HANDS THAN EVER BEFORE.

01:50:26.419 --> 01:50:27.554
HOWEVER ACT THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:28.755
REALLY ONLY PART OF THE

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:29.856
SOLUTION. ENGAGEMENT FROM THE

01:50:29.923 --> 01:50:30.924
HEALTH CARE ECOSYSTEM CAN

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:31.691
ENSURE THAT A PATIENT IS ENGAGE

01:50:31.758 --> 01:50:32.258
BUT ALSO THAT THEIR DATA IS

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.159
VALUED. AND THIS CAN SUPPORT

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:34.627
SCALABILITY WHICH ULTIMATELY

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:35.261
HOPEFULLY WILL REDUCE COSTS AND

01:50:35.328 --> 01:50:37.330
IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH.

01:50:37.397 --> 01:50:38.198
CHALLENGES WILL PROBABLY

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:40.266
CONTINUE TO RISE AROUND VARYING

01:50:40.333 --> 01:50:42.235
PRIVACY LAWS VERY ENGAGEMENT

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:44.070
FROM PATIENTS PROVIDERS AND

01:50:44.137 --> 01:50:46.206
PAYERS WE ARE COMMITTED TO THIS

01:50:46.272 --> 01:50:47.407
PROGRAM. WE'D BE HAPPY TO

CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.576
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON

01:50:49.642 --> 01:50:50.610
WAYS TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.912
PRECISION MEDICINE. AND I'M

01:50:52.979 --> 01:50:53.546

MUCH AND SO THE APP IS THAT THE

01:50:59.019 --> 01:51:01.621
FDA APPROVAL PROCESS OR SENATE.

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.323
THAT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:05.392
ALTOGETHER HERE WHAT'S THAT.

01:51:05.458 --> 01:51:07.127
RULE PROCESS YEAH IT'S A VERY

01:51:07.193 --> 01:51:09.362
GOOD QUESTION IT'S- TODAY IT'S

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:12.832
A RESEARCH TOOL WERE EXPLORING

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:15.535
KIND OF WHAT'S THE REGULATORY

01:51:15.602 --> 01:51:19.472
PATHWAY. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

01:51:19.539 --> 01:51:23.610
HAVING SOME FTA REGULATORY.

01:51:23.676 --> 01:51:24.210
WHEN WE HELPFUL FOR YOU KNOW

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:25.512
INDUSTRY IN PURSUING OUR

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:26.479
CLINICAL TRIALS PROGRAMS TO

01:51:26.546 --> 01:51:27.614
WORK KIND OF SKIPPING THAT OUT

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.214
RIGHT NOW BUT TODAY. IT'S AS A

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:31.117
RESEARCH TOOL. IN YOU KNOW

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:31.718
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TODAY ABOUT

01:51:31.785 --> 01:51:34.054
ACCESS AND- THIS COMMITTEE I

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.021
THINK AT SOME POINT WE'LL WE'LL

01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:37.791
DO A US HEARING SPECIFICALLY

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.360
AROUND. BROADENING ACCESS TO

01:51:40.427 --> 01:51:44.230
CLINICAL TRIALS. AND

01:51:44.297 --> 01:51:45.932
DEMOCRATIZING THAT PROCESS

01:51:45.999 --> 01:51:47.400
SHALL WE SAY SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:50.170
A- CLINICAL TRIAL PROCESS FOR

01:51:50.236 --> 01:51:52.839
THE 1% OR THOSE WHO ARE WIRED

01:51:52.906 --> 01:51:54.574
IN AND CONNECTED. TO THE RIGHT

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:57.043
PEOPLE. TO MAKE A CALL SO TO

01:51:57.110 --> 01:51:59.312
SPEAK TO GET THEM INTO A

01:51:59.379 --> 01:52:03.149
CLINICAL TRIAL. SO HOW DO WE

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:05.919
ENSURE THAT THIS IS THIS KIND

01:52:05.985 --> 01:52:07.987
OF TECHNOLOGY IS BROADLY

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:09.756
ACCESSIBLE BROADLY AVAILABLE

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:11.858
WHAT CAN. A COMPANY LIKE

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.059
GENETIC WITH THE RESOURCES IT

01:52:13.126 --> 01:52:15.161
HAS. YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU ENSURE

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:17.464
SOME OF THOSE GOALS ARE MET

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:18.898
YEAH I THINK THANKS FOR THE

01:52:18.965 --> 01:52:21.067
QUESTION I MEAN I THINK THAT.

01:52:21.134 --> 01:52:22.302
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IDEA ON

01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:23.870
ACCESS TO RESEARCH AND CLINICAL

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.672
TRIALS IS CRITICAL AND I WOULD

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:28.508
SAY THAT. YOU KNOW AT GENENTECH

01:52:28.575 --> 01:52:30.777
FOR WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING

01:52:30.844 --> 01:52:31.978
DIVERSITY INCLUSION OUR TRIALS

01:52:32.045 --> 01:52:34.447
AND THAT STARTS WITH NOT ONLY.

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:36.015
KIND OF THE INCLUSION EXCLUSION

01:52:36.082 --> 01:52:36.983
CRATER TRIALS BUT IT STARTS

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.651
WITH THE ACCESS TO TRIAL

01:52:38.718 --> 01:52:42.522
CENTERS IT STARTS WITH ACCESS

01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:43.923
FOR A BROAD RANGE OF PATIENTS

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:49.429
TO THE DOCK IS IT'S WITH.

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:49.996
MAKING TRIAL REASONABLE FOR

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:53.633
PATIENTS TO MANY PEOPLE. CAN'T

01:52:53.700 --> 01:52:55.368
TAKE TIME OFF WORK CAN'T FIND

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.236
TELL KAREN CAN'T TRAVEL TO FOR

01:52:56.302 --> 01:52:56.836
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW A CENTER OF

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:57.470
EXCELLENCE WHERE. KEY CLINICAL

01:52:57.537 --> 01:52:58.538
TRIALS SO HOW CAN WE MAKE THESE

01:52:58.605 --> 01:53:00.106
TRIALS MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR MORE

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:02.308
PEOPLE AND IT'S FOCUSED ON THE

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:03.443
INCLUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.678
BUT IT'S ALSO FOCUSED ON. YOU

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:06.980
KNOW THE SOUP TO NUTS PROCESS

01:53:07.046 --> 01:53:08.781
OF A CLINICAL TRIAL WHERE THEY

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:10.683
SIT WHERE THEY RESIDE IN HOW

01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:11.885
THY'RE CONDUCTED. YOU KNOW IF

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.953
WE'RE SUCCESSFUL FLOOD LIKE

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:16.022
COULD BE A TOOL FOR YOU KNOW

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:18.158
SIMILAR TOOLS TO REDUCE THE

01:53:18.224 --> 01:53:20.493
NUMBER OF VISITS THAT A PATIENT

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:21.661
WOULD NEED TO TRAVEL TO A

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:24.130
CENTER FOR EXAMPLE. MANY

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:24.764
INDIVIDUALS CAN'T PARTICIPATING

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.733
TRIALS BECAUSE OF THE AND- SO

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:27.534
WHILE THEY'RE A GREAT

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:28.635
OPPORTUNITY FOR PATIENTS ARE

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:31.070
ALSO A BURDEN BECAUSE IT MAY

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.238
REQUIRE. TRAVEL TO SAN

01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:35.508
FRANCISCO FINDING COVERAGE FOR

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:40.079
THEIR WORK AND SO. WHAT IF WE

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:45.151
COULD LEVERAGE THAT KNOWLEDGE.

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:46.653
LET TO DETER REMOTELY. WOULD BE

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:47.420
VIABLE AND REASONABLE FOR A

01:53:47.487 --> 01:53:48.054
CLINICAL TRIAL. THAT'S A GREAT

01:53:48.121 --> 01:53:48.621
AMBITION FOR US AND I THINK

01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:49.589
THAT IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE

01:53:49.656 --> 01:53:52.392
POSSIBILITY. THAT MORE PATIENTS

01:53:52.458 --> 01:53:52.926
COULD BE PART OF THE READ

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:56.396
RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM. THANK YOU

01:53:56.462 --> 01:53:57.530
DOCTOR LARGE AWAY LET'S TURN TO

01:53:57.597 --> 01:53:58.731
DOCTOR ALLEN ARE TOUGH

ASTRAZENECA GLOBAL BY

01:54:05.872 --> 01:54:07.674
PHARMACEUTICALS COMPANY. THAT

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.609
IS INVOLVED IN THE DISCOVERY

01:54:09.676 --> 01:54:10.843
THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:13.346
DELIVERY OF LIFE CHANGING AND

01:54:13.413 --> 01:54:14.414
IN MANY CASES LIFESAVING

01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.949
MEDICINES AROUND THE WORLD OF

01:54:16.015 --> 01:54:16.883
COURSE YOU'LL BE AWARE THAT WE

01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:18.918
HAVE ON OUR INDIE HUB IN THE

01:54:18.985 --> 01:54:20.119
BAY AREA SO VERY INVESTED IN

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:22.855
CALIFORNIA. IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO

01:54:22.922 --> 01:54:25.191
GO LAST AND RECOGNIZE THAT MY

01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:26.793
REMARKS ARE ALIGNED WITH

01:54:26.859 --> 01:54:28.461
EVERYBODY WHO'S GONE BEFORE ME

01:54:28.528 --> 01:54:30.496
SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:54:30.563 --> 01:54:32.031
CONTINUING SOME OF THE THEMES

01:54:32.098 --> 01:54:33.533
THAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY AROUND

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.368
THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIP.

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:37.570
IN RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL IN

01:54:37.637 --> 01:54:38.338
THE PROMISE OF PRECISION

01:54:38.404 --> 01:54:40.607
MEDICINE. I AM AS THAT MY

01:54:40.673 --> 01:54:42.175
OPENING SLIDE INDICATES

01:54:42.242 --> 01:54:42.909
PRECISION MEDICINE PRESSURES

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:46.813
ANNIKA IS VERY MUCH IN OUR DNA

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:47.647
WE HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:49.482
OF DRIVING PRECISION MEDICINE

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:51.084
ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES

01:54:51.150 --> 01:54:52.418
ANOTHER INDUSTRY AND OTHER

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:54.420
FORMS COMPANIES. SINCE THE

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.488
EARLY. NINETEEN SEVENTIES WITH

01:54:55.555 --> 01:54:56.389
THE BUILDING OF MARKS WHICH

01:54:56.456 --> 01:54:56.956
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE

01:54:57.023 --> 01:54:58.024
FIRST PRECISION MEDICINES A

01:54:58.091 --> 01:55:02.729
DRUG THAT IS STILL IN USE TODAY.

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:03.329
FOR HORMONE RECEPTOR POSITIVE

01:55:03.396 --> 01:55:09.602
BREAST CANCER. SINCE THAT TIME.

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:10.770
OUR PIPELINE HAS CONTINUE TO

01:55:10.837 --> 01:55:11.704
FOCUS ON PRECISION MEDICINE

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:12.305
THERE'S A LOT OF DATA ON THE

01:55:12.372 --> 01:55:12.939
SLIDE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:13.573
FOLLOW THROUGH AND ALL OF THAT

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.941
BUT I THINK THE NUMBER THAT IS

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:18.211
KEY TO LOOK AT HERE IS THE 90%

01:55:18.278 --> 01:55:20.913
NUMBER CURRENTLY 90% OF THE

01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:22.248
MOLECULES IN OUR CLINICAL

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:23.549
DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE ARE

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:24.350
DESIGNED AND BUILT WITH

01:55:24.417 --> 01:55:26.786
PRECISION MEDICINE IN MIND IT

01:55:26.853 --> 01:55:28.888
IS THE FUTURE WE ARE ALL MOVING

01:55:28.955 --> 01:55:30.356
AWAY I THINK FROM A ONE SIZE

01:55:30.423 --> 01:55:32.659
FITS ALL APPROACH TO MEDICINE.

01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.327
AND IT'S VERY HEARTENING TO

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:34.861
HEAR ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:36.329
AROUND THE TABLE AND EARLIER

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:37.697
TODAY TALKING ABOUT THE

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:38.298
DIFFERENT WAYS THE CALIFORNIA

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:39.666
IS BEST A GAPING BEYOND THE

01:55:39.732 --> 01:55:42.268
DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES THE

01:55:42.335 --> 01:55:42.802
ABILITY TO BRING PRECISION

01:55:42.869 --> 01:55:45.171
MEDICINE TO THE FOUR.

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:46.372
ASTRAZENECA WE ARE FOCUSED ON

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:48.241
THREE MAIN THERAPY AREAS.

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:50.743
CARDIOVASCULAR RENAL AND

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:52.078
METABOLISM DISEASES.

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:53.680
RESPIRATORY DISEASES AND

01:55:53.746 --> 01:55:55.181
ONCOLOGY AND FOR THE PURPOSES

01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:56.983
OF THE REST OF MY- TESTIMONY

01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:58.017
TODAY I'LL BE FOCUS IN

01:55:58.084 --> 01:55:59.786
ONCOLOGY. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:00.887
SOME OF THE OTHER NUMBERS ON

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:01.921
THE SLIDE ONE ANOTHER NUMBER

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:03.056
THAT I THINK IS KEY FOR YOU TO

01:56:03.122 --> 01:56:04.657
LOOK AT IS THE TWENTY TWO

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:07.527
DIAGNOSTIC. TESTS IT'S K<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; FOR&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:08.728
YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS NUMBER

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.563
BECAUSE- WE DON'T MAKE

01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:12.231
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS WE MAKE

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.866
MEDICINES. ASTRAZENECA ONLY

01:56:13.933 --> 01:56:14.801
MAKES MEDICINES AND SO TO IN

01:56:14.867 --> 01:56:15.868
ORDER TO CREATE PRECISION

01:56:15.935 --> 01:56:17.670
MEDICINES. WE HAVE TO PARTNER

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:18.705
WITH OTHER COMPANIES WERE

01:56:18.771 --> 01:56:20.573
CREATING THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.374
YOU CAN SEE A NUMBER THERE ARE

01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:22.842
A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:24.677
INVESTED IN DIAGNOSTIC

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:25.678
PARTNERSHIPS SINCE TWO THOUSAND

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:28.047
FOURTEEN. THE PURPOSE OF

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:29.182
SHARING THAT NUMBER IS TO

01:56:29.248 --> 01:56:30.750
CONFIRM REITERATE A LOT OF

01:56:30.817 --> 01:56:32.185
WHAT'S ALREADY GONE BEFORE US

01:56:32.251 --> 01:56:33.353
THE PROMISE OF PRECISION

01:56:33.419 --> 01:56:35.054
MEDICINE. IS BASED ON

01:56:35.121 --> 01:56:36.989
PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION.

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:38.558
THAT IS HOW WE CAN DELIVER WHAT

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:41.127
IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX SCIENCE TO

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:42.295
THE COMMUNITY WE'VE HEARD

01:56:42.362 --> 01:56:43.629
TESTIMONY FROM OTHERS TALKING

01:56:43.696 --> 01:56:45.431
ABOUT LEVELING THE LEVELING THE

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.966
PLAYING FIELD. AGAIN WE ARE ONE

01:56:47.033 --> 01:56:48.334
PART OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.403
DEVELOPING MEDICINES BUT IN

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:50.937
ORDER TO LEVEL THE PLAYING

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:51.537
FIELD WE NEED TO CONNECT WITH

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:54.540
EVERYBODY. ASTRA'S TO RECOGNIZE

01:56:54.607 --> 01:56:57.543
SOME TIME AGO THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:58.144
PARTNERSHIPS AND LEVELING THE

01:56:58.211 --> 01:57:00.613
PLAYING FIELD. AND SO JUST WITH

01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.616
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE INITIATED

01:57:03.683 --> 01:57:05.785
SOME VERY LARGE PARTNERSHIPS

01:57:05.852 --> 01:57:07.286
WITH ACADEMIC CENTERS WITH

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:10.056
CANCER CENTERS AND WITH OTHERS

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.090
UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T GET INTO

01:57:11.157 --> 01:57:12.325
THE DETAILS OF WHO THESE ARE

01:57:12.392 --> 01:57:13.359
THESE PARTNERSHIPS ARE WITH

01:57:13.426 --> 01:57:15.161
TODAY BECAUSE WE'RE UNDER

01:57:15.228 --> 01:57:17.430
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. BUT

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:18.731
WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO

01:57:18.798 --> 01:57:20.333
THIS ALONE WE HAVE TO PARTNER

01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:21.467
WITH OTHERS THAT THESE ARE BIG

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.735
PROGRAMS THESE ARE VERY

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.370
SPECIFIC CENTERS HOW CAN WE

01:57:24.437 --> 01:57:26.272
TAKE THAT IDEA PARTNERSHIP AND

01:57:26.339 --> 01:57:28.808
BUILD IT EVEN FURTHER. AGAIN I

01:57:28.875 --> 01:57:30.777
REPRESENT INDUSTRY I REPRESENT

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:33.413
ONE COMPANY BUT BEYOND THE

01:57:33.479 --> 01:57:34.013
DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICINES WHICH

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.282
IS WHAT WE DO. WE RECOGNIZE

01:57:36.349 --> 01:57:36.983
THAT WE HAVE A ROLE IN

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:39.485
CONVENING THE COMMUNITY. AND SO

01:57:39.552 --> 01:57:42.021
LAST YEAR ASTRAZENECA U. S.

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:43.656
CREATED A PROGRAM CALLED YOUR

01:57:43.723 --> 01:57:47.393
CANCER. YOUR CANCER PROGRAM IS

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:49.162
A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM

01:57:49.228 --> 01:57:51.798
DESIGNED TO CONVENE ENGAGE

01:57:51.864 --> 01:57:54.267
ELEVATE AND CELEBRATE THOSE

01:57:54.333 --> 01:57:54.934
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:57.503
COMMUNITY WHO ARE MAKING CHANGE

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.037
OR WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE

01:57:58.104 --> 01:58:00.973
CHANGE. WITHIN THAT PROGRAM

01:58:01.040 --> 01:58:02.408
NUMBER OF COMPONENTS THAT ARE

01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:04.410
DESIGNED TO REALLY PUSH FORWARD

01:58:04.477 --> 01:58:05.711
SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

01:58:05.778 --> 01:58:07.180
WANT TO SEE BUT I THINK IT'S

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:09.215
TELLING THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:10.516
OF THE PROGRAM WE CHOSE TO

01:58:10.583 --> 01:58:13.085
FOCUS ON PRECISION MEDICINE. I

01:58:13.152 --> 01:58:14.487
THINK IT'S ALSO VERY TELLING

SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA I'M

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:20.526

WHAT SOME OF THE BARRIERS. TO

01:59:13.079 --> 01:59:15.615
PRECISION MEDICINE MIGHT BE WE

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.016
TALK SPECIFICALLY AROUND FOUR

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.151
MAIN AREAS. CLINICAL BARRIERS

01:59:19.218 --> 01:59:21.821

TECHNOLOGY BARRIERS AND

01:59:25.491 --> 01:59:25.858
EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:29.428
BUREAUCRACY. WE ARE STILL

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:30.997
CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP WITH

01:59:31.063 --> 01:59:32.565
THE TWENTY FOUR ATTENDEES FROM

01:59:32.632 --> 01:59:34.333
THAT SESSION AND THE GREETER AT

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.935
ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE

01:59:36.002 --> 01:59:37.270
THAT WE NEED TO BRING EVERYBODY

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:38.771
TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:59:38.838 --> 01:59:40.606
BUT IS OUR INTENT TO MOVE

01:59:40.673 --> 01:59:41.440
FORWARD WITH SOME OF THE

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:42.441
SUGGESTIONS THAT CAME OUT OF

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:45.811
THAT ROOM TABLE IN ORDER TO TRY

01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:46.345
TO OVERCOME SOME OF THOSE

01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:48.881
BARRIERS. TO POLICY. IT IS OUR

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:49.515
IMPRESSION IT ASKED AND I CAN I

01:59:49.582 --> 01:59:51.117
THINK IT'S BEEN HERALDED HERE

01:59:51.183 --> 01:59:52.351
AND REITERATED BY SOME OF THOSE

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:53.953
WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME. THAT ONE

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.221
OF THE CHALLENGES WITH

01:59:55.288 --> 01:59:57.256
PRECISION MEDICINE. IS THAT THE

01:59:57.323 --> 01:59:59.358
SCIENCE IS ADVANCING FAR

01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:02.161
FASTER. THAN THE RED REGULATION

02:00:02.228 --> 02:00:04.597
AND LEGISLATION. I'M SO. ANY

02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:06.198
OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BE

02:00:06.265 --> 02:00:08.167
PART OF THAT GREATER ECOSYSTEM.

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:09.735
TO COME TO YOU TO TALK TO YOU

02:00:09.802 --> 02:00:10.937
TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND TO HELP

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:12.238
EDUCATE EVERYBODY ON WHAT THE

02:00:12.305 --> 02:00:13.906
CHALLENGES ARE. AND SOME OF THE

02:00:13.973 --> 02:00:17.577
SOLUTIONS TO OVERCOMING THOSECHALLENGES. WOULD BE WELCOME.

02:00:17.643 --> 02:00:18.911
AND SO IF I CAN CASTRO. YEAH

02:00:18.978 --> 02:00:20.713
AND I DON'T THE SUFFERS I HAVE

02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:22.381
INTERRUPTED A PANELIST BUT I

02:00:22.448 --> 02:00:24.517
I'M JUST. CURIOUS ON THAT.

02:00:24.584 --> 02:00:27.486
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT POINT

02:00:27.553 --> 02:00:31.757
ABOUT. GOVERNMENT. MOVING

02:00:31.824 --> 02:00:32.525
SLOWER THAN THE TECHNOLOGY. IS

02:00:32.592 --> 02:00:33.926
THAT. THE PERCEPTION OF THE

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:35.928
COMPANY THAT THAT'S A LARGELY A

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.597
FEDERAL PROBLEM FOR MORE OF A

02:00:37.663 --> 02:00:39.098
STATE BASED PROBLEM OR JUST A

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:41.534
MIX OF BOTH. HOW WOULD YOU

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:43.769
CHARACTERIZE ABIZAID. I'VE

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:44.403
HEARD THIS BEFORE THIS IS NOT A

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:48.140
SHOCK. BELIEVE OR NOT BUT A HOW

02:00:48.207 --> 02:00:50.076
WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT. I

02:00:50.142 --> 02:00:51.410
WOULD SAY IT'S I WOULD SAY IT'S

02:00:51.477 --> 02:00:52.812
A MIX OF BOTH FEDERAL AND AT

02:00:52.878 --> 02:00:54.714
THE STATE LEVEL AND I THINK

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:55.781
THERE'S REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:00:55.848 --> 02:00:57.683
STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA. TO

02:00:57.750 --> 02:01:00.086
REALLY FORGE AHEAD HERE IN TO

02:01:00.152 --> 02:01:01.053
LEAD FOR THE FEDERAL POLICIES

02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.122
LOCKING BEHIND STILL. AND SO I

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:04.523
THINK IT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:06.892
FOR YOU TO TAKE THAT STEP AND

02:01:06.959 --> 02:01:08.561
WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT WITH

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:09.428
SOME STATES AND SOME STATES

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:10.196
IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:12.231
LEGISLATION AND OTHER STATES

02:01:12.298 --> 02:01:13.532
FOLLOWING SUIT BECAUSE THEY SEE

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:15.468
THE VALUE. THE CALIFORNIA IS

02:01:15.534 --> 02:01:17.470
ALREADY POISED BECAUSE OF YOUR

02:01:17.536 --> 02:01:18.604
INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE PRECISION

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:19.605
MEDICINE BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:21.007
STARTED TO CONVENE THE KEY

02:01:21.073 --> 02:01:23.042
STAKEHOLDERS. I REALLY DO

02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:24.944
BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE POINTS TO

02:01:25.011 --> 02:01:25.544
BE ABLE TO TAKE A LEADERSHIP

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:27.013
POSITION WITH PRECISION

02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:28.481
MEDICINE AND WHAT THE FEDERAL

02:01:28.547 --> 02:01:29.949
POLICY FOLKS JUST. YET SAYS

02:01:30.016 --> 02:01:31.050
THOSE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:33.953
HIGHLIGHTING TODAY ARE DRAWING

02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:37.323
INVESTMENT. TO THIS STATE. BUT

02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:38.591
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH TO

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:39.325
SUSTAIN THIS. OUT INTO THE

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:40.693
FUTURE NOW WILL WHAT ARE SOME

02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:41.627
OF THE OTHERS YOU MENTIONED

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.362
SOME OF THE OTHER STATES. WHAT

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:44.797
ARE SOME OF THE KINDS OF THINGS

02:01:44.864 --> 02:01:47.233
THAT YOU. ARE HEARING OTHER

02:01:47.299 --> 02:01:50.069
STATES LOOK AT DOING TO TRY TO

02:01:50.136 --> 02:01:51.971
WIN SET OF EYES THIS IS KIND OF

02:01:52.038 --> 02:01:54.073
ACTIVITY IN THEIR STATE. IT'S A

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.841
GREAT QUESTION I CAN'T SPEAK

02:01:55.908 --> 02:01:58.110
TOO MANY SPECIFICS FOR STATES

02:01:58.177 --> 02:01:59.378
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE I'M NOT

02:01:59.445 --> 02:02:00.413
FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE POLICY.

02:02:00.479 --> 02:02:01.480
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:02:01.547 --> 02:02:02.948
WORK BEING DONE AROUND VERY

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:03.883
SIMPLE THINGS LIKE PRIOR

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:05.918
AUTHORIZATION. TO SCIENCE OF

02:02:05.985 --> 02:02:07.253
SIMPLIFY THAT SO THAT AGAIN

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:09.188
LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD MAKE IT

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.389
EASY FOR EVERYBODY TO ACCESS

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:12.425
THESE MEDICINES. THERE'S SOME

02:02:12.491 --> 02:02:14.894
WORK BEING DONE AROUND.

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.563
SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS WITHIN

02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:19.699
HOSPITALS WITHIN IN THAT I

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:21.467
PATIENT CARE SPACE IN ORDER TO

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:22.368
SPEED UP THE ABILITY THAT

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:24.070
PATIENTS CAN ACCESS DIAGNOSTIC

02:02:24.136 --> 02:02:25.604
TESTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE

02:02:25.671 --> 02:02:27.773
MEDICINES. AND SO ON I'M I'M

02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:28.974
SURE MY COLLEAGUES WERE MORE

02:02:29.041 --> 02:02:29.809
FAMILIAR WITH POLICY IN VARIOUS

02:02:29.875 --> 02:02:30.876
OTHER STATES WILL NO MORE BUT

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.511
THERE CERTAINLY. INDIVIDUAL

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:33.846
PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT ARE

02:02:33.913 --> 02:02:34.647
MOVING THROUGH AND BEING

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:35.915
APPROVED ELSEWHERE IN THE

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:38.718
COUNTRY. IT TO TRY AND MAKE

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:39.285
COULD DANCE AND MOVE THINGS

02:02:39.351 --> 02:02:43.989
FORWARD. APPRECIATE THAT. WORK

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:46.125
COMPETITIVE STATE SO I WAS LIKE

02:02:46.192 --> 02:02:47.159
TO. KEEP TABS ON WHAT OTHER

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:47.760
STATES ARE DOING BUT I DIDN'T

02:02:47.827 --> 02:02:50.996
MEAN THAT TO. DEAD TO DETERMINE

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:51.597
YOUR PRESENTATION HERE SO FEEL

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.532
FREE TO PROCEED. REALLY IF I

02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:54.533
JUST HAVE TO LEAVE EVERYBODY

02:02:54.600 --> 02:02:57.737
WITH WITH ONE FINAL REMARK IT

02:02:57.803 --> 02:03:00.439
IS ASTRAZENECA IS OPINION THAT

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:03.042
AS AN INDUSTRY MEMBER AS AN

02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:04.543
ENTITY THAT CREATES THE

02:03:04.610 --> 02:03:06.312
MEDICINE WITHIN PRECISION

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:08.380
MEDICINE WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY

02:03:08.447 --> 02:03:10.649
BEYOND THAT IN CONVENING AND

02:03:10.716 --> 02:03:12.451
I'M BEING PART OF THAT GREATER

02:03:12.518 --> 02:03:13.986
ECOSYSTEM IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT

02:03:14.053 --> 02:03:16.188
PRECISION MEDICINE. WILL NOT

02:03:16.255 --> 02:03:18.224
ACHIEVE ITS ENTIRE PROMISE WITH

02:03:18.290 --> 02:03:19.658
ENGAGED WITHIN THE ECOSYSTEM

02:03:19.725 --> 02:03:20.860
AND I THINK THAT COMMON HAS

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:23.429
BEEN REITERATED BY THOSE WHO'VE

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:23.996
TESTIFIED BEFORE ME SO THANK

02:03:24.063 --> 02:03:26.432
YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU BOTH

02:03:26.499 --> 02:03:28.434
VERY VERY MUCH AND WE ARE OVER
