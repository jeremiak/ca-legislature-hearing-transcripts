INCLUDING EXTREMELY LONG PERMIT PROCESSING TIMES FOR ENFORCEMENT DELAYED SITE REMEDIATION FAILURE TO RESPOND TO PUBLIC CONCERNS IN. KEY IS TO S. IN ATTENTION TO REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF HE SAID THAT THE HANDLING OF THE PRODUCTION OF. HAZARDOUS WASTE HAS IN CALIFORNIA- THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OF LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE TSA PROGRAM.

EVERYONE GIVING US THEIR TESTIMONY OUR GO TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE CHIU WHITE WHOSE WITH THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION ON THE LINE TO VOICE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. YES HELLO- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT STRUCK QUITE I'M A SENIOR ADVISER WITH MEN THAT HELPS JOKES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION- RIGHT WELL IN THE PAST PRESIDENT OF MANY YEARS AGO- THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE. MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION WE MUST. RESPECTFULLY AND ACTUALLY RELUCTANTLY UPHOLSTERY. EIGHTY NINE NINETY NINE NINE FIFTY FIVE. NINETY FIVE OTHER BIG YEAH ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT REFORM IS DEFINITELY WARRANTED AT THE TNC IT MUST BE BALANCED THAT HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED IN CALIFORNIA IS PROPERLY AND SAFELY MANAGE TO CALIFORNIA'S STANDARDS RATHER THAN CURRENT SITUATION WHERE AS MUCH AS 50% OR MORE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IS EXPORTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS MANY OF. WHICH ARE MUCH LESS EDGMON STANDARDS THAT CAL. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS FORMALLY THE HAZARDOUS WASTE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND WAS INCORPORATED. EIGHT NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. HELLO ARE AT OUR MAY IS COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS. THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT STANDARDS WE ARE CONCERNED- THAT THE MATERIALS UP NEVER HAVE THOSE WAYS ARE EXPORTED FROM CALIFORNIA TO THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE EXISTING EXTREMELY LENGTHY DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE PROCESS OF SIDING OR EXPANDING HAS THE SPACE OPERATIONS YOU CALIFORNIA TO MEET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS. OTHER JURISDICTIONS ACTIVELY SUBJECT CALIFORNIA HAS OF THOSE WAYS TO FAR LESS MANAGE LESS STRINGENT MANAGEMENT STANDARDS. AS A RESULT A LOT OF ACTION- WASTE IS EXPORTED TO SURROUNDING STATES AND JURISDICTIONS. EXISTING CALIFORNIA STATE FEES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER THAN FEET BY MANY OTHERS INJURED. CALIFORNIA FEES CAN BE AVOIDED SIMPLY BY EXPORTING WASTE TWO OTHER ADJACENT STATES OR JURISDICTIONS. SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL I WILL TRY TO MENTALLY OF MENTION THEM BRIEFLY- WE ARE LATER IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO CREATING A BOARD. HOWEVER IF THERE IS A BOARD I CREATED IT MUST BE OF POP UP POPULATED BY BUT MORE MORE STRINGENT. REQUIREMENTS FOR- BOARD MEMBER QUALIFICATIONS AND ARTICULATED SOME OF THOSE QUALIFICATIONS THE EX EMPLOYER ARE VERY WITH HAVE TO PROVIDE. ARGUMENT. WE WOULD- HOPE THAT THERE IS A COMPREHENSIVE HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PLANET WHICH IS BADLY NEEDED THE CURRENT LANGUAGE. EIGHTY NINE NINETY FIVE SEEMS TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON- REVIEW OF PERMITTING WHICH IS APPROPRIATE BUT WE THINK THE AUTHORITY OF THE BOARD ESTABLISH SHOULD BE MUCH BROADER TO ENSURE THAT ALL POLICY REGULAR. ENFORCED AT TIMES ARE SUBJECT WILL APPEAL TO THAT BOARD. THE HOUSING ISSUE WE MANAGEMENT PLAN AND FEE STRUCTURE MUST COOLEY ARTICULATE THE STATE'S POLICY ON ACTUAL HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT OTHER JURISDICTIONS. REGULATIONS ARE SICK LESS STRINGENT THAN CALIFORNIA'S. REYES REGULATORY STRUCTURE. THE IT IS PROPOSED. PERMITTING TIME FRAMES IN THE LIKE THE DO NOT NAY SENSE WHICH IS THAT LANGUAGE TO CORRECT RECALL IS A GOOD DAY WERE WE BELIEVE THAT. ACCORDING FOR THE RIGHT OF WATER QUALITY ARE PRESSED WTH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. REGIONAL WATER CONTROL BOARD WE NO OBJECTION TO- DGSE PROVIDING INPUT TO THOSE BOARDS BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT. ULTIMATE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PROVIDE REFORM FOCUSES WATER QUALITY ISSUES ON THE STATE AND REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL. WE BOUGHT HAS BEAT THE REVIEW OF THE MUST BE PROVIDED TO A NEW. THIS WOULDN'T WILL MAKE FINANCE ASSURANCE CORRECTIVE ACTION ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO BOARD REVIEW IF THERE IS A BOARD. WELL CONCERNED ABOUT RATHER THAN RUSH CORRECTIVE ACTION ESTIMATES THE MEDIATION ACTIONS WORKING ABOUT SOME OF THE TIME USERS. THE LEGISLATION. ARTICULATED ERICOM LETTER WE BELIEVE THAT DDS REVIEW OF SPECIFIC COSTESTIMATES MUST BE OBJECTIVE AND ALSO SUBJECT TO YOU BY THE BOARD. AND WHAT. THE PROVISIONS OF. AND FIVE ARE INCONSISTENT WITH OTHER CORRECTIVE ACTION AUTHORITIES THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDED IN THE STATUTE. IN CONCLUSION- WE- ACTUALLY RELUCTANTLY AS I MENTIONED HAVE TO OPPOSE AB NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AS CURRENTLY PROPOSED- UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- WILL REMAIN UNLESS WE'RE ABLE TO SEE SOME AMENDMENTS CAN BE FULL. THRESHING SOME CARD SIR OUR WAGERED MORE FULLY IN OUR COMMENT LET WE APPRECIATE YEAH. TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SOME HI IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO IS A LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION.

THIS BILL UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE LIKELY BEEN REFERRED TO MULTIPLE COMMITTEES BUT IN THESE COLD AT TIMES THERE IS BUT ONE POLICY COMMITTEE THAT WILL HEAR THIS BILL IN THIS FORUM. MANY THIS BILL PURPORTS TO BE A TERRIBLE HOUSING THUS REQUIRING ATTENTION DURING THESE EXTREME TIMES. BUT UPON READING THIS BILL IT BECOMES QUITE CLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH IT PROVIDES FOR STREAMLINING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT ALSO PROVIDES ACCEPTANCE FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS TO BUILD NOT AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND EVEN THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER PROJECT WILL BE SAVED BY USING SUCH A PROCESS AND YET EVEN WITH THIS HUGE GIVE TO DEVELOPERS ALL OF OUR REQUESTS TO AND WORKER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING PREVAILING WAGE AND SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. HAVE LOWERED. THIS IS TO PUT MILES TRAVELED BUT THE DEFINITION OF LOW VMT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND IS SO VAGUE THAT THE MEETING AN APPLICATION ARE UNCLEAR AT BEST AND ALTHOUGH THIS BILL STATED INTENT OF THE LOW BMT STANDARD IS TO SPUR TRANSIT AREA DEVELOP.

THIS IS RACHEL SHOEMAKER I NEED TO BE LOCAL TRIO TO WE REPRESENT OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND WE ARE. TRADE OPPOSITION BILL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYBODY. FOR YOUR ARE FOR THE TESTIMONY I MEAN TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I THIS. THIS LONG LIST OF TESTIMONY WAS A BIT OF A SURPRISE TO ME AND WE GOT A LETTER BUT I DON'T THINK WE GOT A SINGLE CALL FROM- TO THE COMMITTEE FROM. THE TRADES BUT- WE APPRECIATE IT ALL TURNS REYES IN FACT LET ME GIVE AUTHORED THE OPPORTUNITY IF SHE'D LIKE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ON THE- ON THE CALLS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE CALLS I WILL SAY IT IS A BIT DISCOURAGING FOR ME TO HEAR. LONG LIST OF OPPOSITION GIVEN. THAT WE HAVE HAD THESE AMENDMENTS IN PRINT SINCE JULY FIRST. WE SHARED THEM WITH THE TRADE IN MAY ELEVENTH. THEY WERE FORMALLY A SUPPORT POSITION ON THE BILL AND WE ONLY FOUND OUT LATE LAST WEEK THAT THEY WERE NOW. AND POST PETITION. I DON'T HAVE TO SEE AMENDMENTS TO THE WE GET M. A CONSIDERABLE AMENDMENTS WE WERE NOT GIVEN ANY AMENDMENTS. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR TO US EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY SAY THEY OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. BUT I WILL SAY THIS. JUST TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL. DOES NOT ADD ANY NEW EXEMPTIONS TO SEQUOIA. WHAT IT DOES IS IT CLARIFIES N. STREET THEY DON'T EXPAND THE EXAM BUT ONLY BECAUSE- WE'VE BUT THOSE EXACT. WORKING ALWAYS FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE INTENDED. THREE TO CLARIFY THAT IF BUILDING. HOUSING FOR. IN URBAN AND BY SO YOU'RE- SPRAWL YOU REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED YOUR NEW BECAUSE YOUR YOUR JOBS ARE TRANSIT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE EXISTING SEPARATE EXEMPTION. WHAT THE TRADES ARE ASKING FOR IS THAT ALL OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USING THOSE EXEMPTIONS NOW HAVE TO HAVE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. A NEW SKILL AND THE SKILLED WORKFORCE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. THE PERSON WHO RIGHT NOW IS BUILDING A FOUR PLEX WITH THEIR OWN MONEY ON PRIVATE PROPERTY NEAR TRANSIT. WHICH WE DOES NOT HAVE ENTER INTO THAT KIND OF AGREE WOULD FOR FURTHER TO. USE EXEMPTION. BUT ANY PROJECT THAT USING THOSE CURRENT EXEMPTIONS. AT RIGHT NOW FOR FREE FROM HAVING TO USE. THAT THAT A SKILLED WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZE BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE ANY PUBLIC MONEY FOR WHATEVER REASON WOULD NO LNGER BE ABLE TO USE AN EXEMPTION THAT THEY COULD USE RIGHT NOW OR YESTERDAY OR LAST YEAR. SO THIS IS A VAST EXPANSION OF THAT REQUIRE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT STOPS THE BUILDING TRADES FROM THE GLACIATION. THOSE TERMS WITH DEVELOPERS AND THEY FREQUENTLY DO THAT IN THESE AREAS THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT RULES ANY OF THOSE PROTECTIONS FACT. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW THIS ROLLS WORKER PROTECTIONS BACK. THIS IS MERELY WORKING WITH CURRENT EXEMPTIONS IN THE LAW. SO WE ARE OF COURSE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TRADE WE SEE THEM AS PARTNERS ON OUR LEGISLATION WE SEE THEM AS ALLIES. TURNED TO PROTECTING WORKERS. PROTECTING THE ECONOMY IN OUR AREA. BUT WE- BOB IN TILL WE SEE THE AMENDMENTS FROM THEM IT'S VERY HARD FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO THIS OPPOSITION. SO I WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE COURTESY OF ALLOWING THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD AND I WOULD HAVE TO TRADE TO PLEASE SIT DOWN WITH US. WELL IN ADVANCE OF OUR NEXT HEARING AND GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH YOU. TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR ISSUE THEY BROUGHT UP A ABOUT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL I WANT TO CLARIFY THIS BILL DOES NOT. ADD EXEMPTIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL USES OR COMMERCIAL USES. THE BILL MENTIONS THE WORD COMMERCIAL ONLY TO SPECIFY THE AREA IN WHICH HOUSING IS TO BE BUILT IN COMMERCIAL AREAS SO I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD. AND AGAIN WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO THIS IS TO BE DISCUSSED WITH THE TRADE WE DID ADD THEIR AMENDMENTS. GOING INTO THE LAST COMMITTEE THE AND- INVITE THEM TO COME IN AND SIT DOWN WITH MYSELF AND MY STAFF TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU- MADISON NUMBER ONE WE NOW GO TO CENTER WILL CASKEY RESEARCHER I AYE HAS. WITH REGARD TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ONE OF THE STAFF. TALKS ON PAGE ABOUT YOU KNOW SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH CREATED A LOT OF. MNY MORE EXEMPTIONS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS A SUNSET DATE AND THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE- IN THE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS BY THE COMMITTEE AND I WAS WONDERING- IF I CAN GET THE AUTHORS- TAKE ON THAT AND THE REASON THAT I HAVE IS CLOSE TO PAGE ELEVEN OF THE STAFF REPORT AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE LOW VEHICLE STANDS- TRAVEL BAN. YEAH I THINK I TOOK A STEP BACK WHEN I SAW THIS THEY REALIZE. CALIFORNIANS DRIVE OF THE LOAD OF MILES EVERY YEAR I MEAN WE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR SOMEBODY TO BE TRAVELING TWO HUNDRED MILES TO AND FROM WORK. SO 85% OR TWO ONE AND FIVE IS A RATHER LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY OUR LARGE AMOUNT OF MILES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIRE MENTAL CONCERNS CONCERNS SO. THE STATE MAP POOL IS BEING WERE ON BUT I DON'T KNOW I'M CONCERNED WITH HAVING. THE IS CAN A MEMBER ON THE EIGHTY. I DON'T KNOW IF THE 85% IS THE MAGIC EXEMPTION LEVEL PARTICULARLY WITH. THE FACT THAT THIS THIS. MODIFICATION OF THE EXEMPTION OF VOLVO AGREE WITH THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE ON FOREVER NEVER AND IT DOESN'T. ALLOW THE TRIGGER TO COME TO THIS. COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW SO THAT'S MY- CAN THE AUTHOR. DO YOU LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE CONCERN OF THE CENTER ABSOLUTELY THE SENATOR AND I HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS AND WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS WITH MAKING SURE THAT THESE PROJECTS DO NOT ENCOURAGE SPRAWL BUT THEY DON'T ENCOURAGE MORE DRIVING THAT THEY DO THE OPPOSITE WE ARE MORE THAN TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND WITH THE- THEY'RE INTENDED TO DO SO WE- HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHETHER IN APPROPRIATIONS ARE ON THE FLOOR. TO MAKE FURTHER REFINEMENTS OF THAT PORTION OF THE BILL. IN IN THE OTHER. I MEAN I'D LIKE TO STEP AMENDMENTS ON DEFINING THE AREA OF TRAVEL I AGAIN. WE TEN YEARS AGO WE WOULD NEVER OF THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW DRIVING FROM THE INLAND EMPIRE DOWN TO THE WEST SIDE OF LA WOULD BE. ONE NORMAL THING TO DO OR DO WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE DOING IT WAS SORT OF ALL A ONE OFF AND- I. I THINK THAT'S. SIR WE LOOK AT THE METROPOL AREA. WHAT IS NOT FOR THE- ASCENTIAL. MAY BE DIFFERENT OR MAYBE THE SAME AS THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I'M I'M- I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO TRAVEL LESSEN THEIR CARS IN A- SIGNIFICANT WAY HELLO. I WAS IN PLANNING TO. THE TO VOTE ON THE BILL I'VE HAD SOME CONCERN- CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR- OUR COLLEAGUE- MYSKINA WHO'S NOT HERE BECAUSE OF THE COBIT CHALLENGES ND SHE IS A SUPPORTER OF- AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE SO. WITH THAT CAVIAR THAT TIME WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS I WILL. MOVED BILL FOR PURPOSES OF THIS HEARING TODAY MR. THANK YOU SENATOR. OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGHTS DISCUSSION.

TO PROMOTE SWIFTER AND MORE EFFICIENT RESOLUTIONS OF LAWSUITS REGARDING ALL PROJECTS. HOW DO WE KNOW THERE ARE COMMON DELAYS. AND THAT THE CURRENT PROCEDURES TO EXPEDITE SEQUEL OR AN ADEQUATE. EVERY YEAR DOZENS OF BILLS ARE INTRODUCED TO GIVE SPECIAL CONSIDERATION TO FAVORED PROJECTS. WEATHER SPORTS STADIUMS OR OTHER LARGE PROJECTS WE HEAR FROM ADVOCATE SAID WE NEED TO PASS SPECIFIC LEGISLATION TO TARGET THOSE PROJECTS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY'LL GET CAUGHT UP. IN THE LAWSUIT. RIGHT IN OUR WOULD LIMITED SESSION THERE ARE SO BILL. THAT CREATE HARD NINE MONTH DEADLINE TO RESOLUTIONS OF SECRET CASES INCLUDING APPEALS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE SEE NEARLY FIFTY SUCH BILLS NOT TO MENTION SCORES A BILL TO CREATE EXEMPTIONS FAVOR PROJECTS. THE PREMISE OF ALL THESE BILLS IS A FIGURE JUDICIALYOU IN PARTICULAR IS AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN CREATING RISK AND DELAYED IT KILLS PROJECTS. ISN'T THAT HAVE NOT. I DON'T PROTECTION. THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL IS A COMMON BELIEF IN CIVIL LITIGATION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ACROSS THE BOARD FOR ALL PROJECTS NOT JUST A SPECIFIC VIEW FOR THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A MULTIBILLION CREATING A HUGE PROJECT TO BUY. IT SHOULD BE EXPEDITED IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS THE COURT'S. AND DOESN'T JUST JAMMED UP WITH ARBITRARY DEADLINE PARTICULARLY WHEN THEIR RESOURCES ARE SPREAD SO THIN. THE PRIOR VERSION OF THIS BILL PRESS SEVEN I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE WORK TO CONTROVERSIES AND ADDRESS CONCERNS FROM ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES FROM HER AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.

UNDER THE PROCESS BUTTE FOOT DRAGGING AND GUESTS WHEN SHIPPING ALL SIDES CAN ADD MONTHS AT THE VERY BEGINNING TO LITIGATION PROCESS THE BILL GIVES LEADING AGENCIES THE ABILITY TO RETAIN CONTROL OVER PREPARATION OF THE RECORDS.

AND THE BILL FOCUSED SOLELY ON IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE LITIGATION PROCESS UNDER SPEAK WELL. IN PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD WHICH SERVES AS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE OF DOCUMENTS AND EVIDENCE BEFORE COURT PEOPLE LITIGATION. IT HORRIFICALLY KIND CONSUMING AND DEDUCTIBLE THE LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT LEAD TO UNNECESSARY DELAYS. THAT WILL HINDER- THE REVOLUTION IN THE BAR MENTAL ISSUES PERTAINING TO LAND. USE PROJECTS CALIFORNIA. BILL ADDRESSES COMMON PROBLEM BY ROBERT PROCEDURES UNDER. THE AUTHORIZE A LEADING DID ON THE RESPONSE. ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD SO LONG AS THE LEAD AGENCY AGREED TO WAIVE ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND THAT NOTABLE CHANGE- REALLY PRESERVES AND IF NOT SHE'LL ANNIE KITCHENER'S WANTED TO CHALLENGE.
