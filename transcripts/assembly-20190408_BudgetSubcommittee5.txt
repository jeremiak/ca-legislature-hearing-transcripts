SO IF I CAN'T GIVEN THE THE TIME MIGHT BE A LITTLE CONSTRAINT I'M JUST GOING TO SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING RECAP. SOME OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR UNIV SIR CERTAINLY COURSE AFTER I FINISH UP. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS OR THIS IN ANY COMMENTS YOU MIGHT HAVE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ERA OUR BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES WELL WE TESTED TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE KITS WE ARE UP TO DATE WE HAVE NO BACKLOG. I WE CONTINUE TO DO OTHER WORK WE SOLVE MURDERS WE CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS ESPECIALLY FOR EXAMPLE OF OUR RECENT FIRES THE CAMPFIRE. A AND SO FORTH OUR FORENSIC SERVICES TEAM -- PROVIDES FORENSICS WORK TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE NECESSARY FOR PROSECUTION FOR MOST OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORIAL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE DO SO MAD CHAIR I WANNA REMIND EVERYONE WITHOUT CHARGE TO YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS TO YOUR SHARES DEPARTMENTS TO YOUR PROSECUTORS. MOST OF THEM EXCEPT FOR THOSE IN THE BIG CITIES IN AND THE COUNTY THAT CAN AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR OWN FORENSIC SERVICES. WHERE THE -- AGENCY OF FIRST RESORT IF WE DON'T DO IT FOR THEM THEN YOUR FOLKS IN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND IT A FAR HIGHER COST. WE ALSO HAPPEN TO HAVE THE PREMIER FORENSIC -- TEAM IN THE NATION EXCEPT PERHAPS FOR THE FEDS OUR SHOP DOES THE MOST AND THE BEST WORK AROUND THE NATION. OUR BUREAU OF FIREARMS AGENTS WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO DISARM DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS. ARE IN A JOINT OPERATION LAST FALL FOR EXAMPLE WORKING WITH THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. OUR AGENTS RETRIEVED SEVEN ASSAULT WEAPONS FIFTY SIX HAND GUNS TWENTY ONE SHOT GUNS FORTY AB SORRY TWENTY FOUR RIFLES. AND THREE LOWER RECEIVERS WHICH ARE PART OF OTHER FIREARM. IN ADDITION WE SEIZED ALONG WITH THOSE OCT THAT CASH OF WEAPONS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION FIFTY HIGH CAPACITY MAGAZINE WHICH I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TODAY. ARE NOT LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA. OUR AND WE PREVAILED RECENTLY IN A LAWSUIT DEALING WITH THE CENSUS TRYING TO AVOID. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDING A QUESTION ABOUT CITIZENSHIP WHICH AS YOU KNOW WOULD CUT BECAUSE IN AT UNDER COUNT. AND AS WE ARE ALL WE'RE VERY WELL AWARE AN UNDERCOUNT COULD COST NOT JUST. MONEY BUT ALSO REPRESENTATION QUICK EXAMPLE NINETEEN NINETY WE HAD AN UNDERCOUNTER JUST HI TWO POINT 74%. THE RESULT WE LOST A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND WE LOST A TENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT'S RESULT THAT THAT'S THAT TARA. UNDERCOUNT TWO POINTS 74% WE DON'T WANT EXPERIENCE THAT AGAIN BECAUSE WE DESERVE TOHAVE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER DOLLARS RETURN TO CALIFORNIA. AND WE WANT TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE SEAT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT OUR STATE DESERVES A FOUR FORTY MILLION. PEOPLE. ARE WE SECURED HISTORIC AND IN SOME CASES A EXTREMELY X. SICKENING PICKET SETTLEMENTS OUR OFFICE FROM SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN AMERICA -- HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM WELLS FARGO A HUNDRED NINETEEN AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS. A HUNDRED TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM BRITISH PETROLEUM ENERGY COMPANY SEVENTY EIGHT A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FROM FIAT CHRYSLER. CONTINUED NAY MORE. WE CHALLENGE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THE LAWFUL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT CONDITIONS IN TRYING TO DEPRIVE OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS. AGENCIES OF JAG FUNDING FOR THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. ARE THAT RESULTED IN RETRIEVING FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TODAY AS A RESULT OF OUR LEGAL WORK AS WELL RELATED TO IMMIGRATION MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND DREAMERS. HAVE COMPLETED THEIR DOCTOR RENEWAL WHICH IF YOU RECALL -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CALL FOR THE REPEAL OF THAT PROGRAM SO CLOSE. TO EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUE TO HAVE DOCTOR PROTECTION AS RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT THAT WE FILED. OUR WE HAVE HELD MORE THAN A SEVEN PUBLIC FORUMS AND MEETINGS WITH. OUR STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO HEAR THEIR REMARKS AND COMMENTS REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT WHICH YOU ALL PASSED IN A LANDMARK ACTION BECAUSE NO OTHER STATE OR EVEN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- PROVIDES THAT TYPE OF PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS OVER THE INTERNET AND NOW IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THAT RULE MAKING. WE'RE FIGHTING IN COURT TO DEFEND CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN CAR STANDARDS ARE THOSE THAT ARE A MODEL NOW FOR THE REST THE NATION. ARE THEY ARE -- MIMIC CALIFORNIA STANDARDS AND THEY ARE NOW NATIONAL STANDARDS THAT WERE HERE TO FIGHT TO PROTECT THOSE NATIONAL STANDARDS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE TAX RECOVERY AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY A TEAM THAT WE HAVE TO GO AFTER BUSINESSES THAT DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES THEY DON'T PAY THEIR WORKERS THE RIGHT SALARIES. THEY DON'T COVER THEM WITH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORKER'S COMPENSATION THEY DON'T PAY STATE TAXES. AND IS RESULT THEY ARE MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS TO DO PLAY BY THE RULES AS BUSINESSES TO COMPETE. ARE WE BROUGHT IN ABOUT SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE. ARE WE BUSTED OPERATION IN THE BAY AREA CALLED RAINBOW BRITE IT WAS A SUPPOSEDLY AN ADULT AND CHILD CARE FACILITY PROVIDING CARE FOR ADULTS AND ALSO FOR CHILDREN. THEY WERE ALSO HAPPY THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO BE RAINY -- TRAFFICKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING RING WHERE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY KEEPING PEOPLE GET CLOSE TO SLAVE WAGES -- IN SOME CASES THEY WERE TRAFFICKING SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES FOR SEX -- WE WERE ABLE TO BUST THEM THROUGH THE WORK OF THE TAX RECOVERY AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY TEAM AND WE ALSO HAPPEN TO FIND FIREARMS INCLUDING RIGHT THERE IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. THAT WERE HELD BY THESE FOLKS WE'RE LEAD A COALITION AS YOU KNOW OF TWENTY ONE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO FIGHT TO PROTECT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IT IS THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING. AS THE EADER TOURNEY'S IN THAT CASE THAT WILL KEEP THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT GOING PROTECT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION AMERICANS WHO HAVE A PRE EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITION WHO COULD LOSE THAT IF --IF THIS CASE WERE GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION IN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WOULD BE REPEALED TO THE COURTS AND SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO NOW HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS A RESULT OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS OR WHO HAVE KIDS WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR FAMILIES WITH HEALTHCARE. FINALLY I'LL JUST MENTION OF SOME OF OUR BUDGET REQUESTS THAT ARE A PENDING. OUR ON THE APPS PROGRAM THE ARE PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM -- WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL LOOK AT THIS VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES THAT IT IT WILL TAKE AND WE HOPE NOT BASED ON LIMITED TERM APPOINTMENT BUT I'M PERMANENT POINT IS. ACTUALLY LET IT BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE ARE THE GOVERNOR AGREED WITH US THAT WE SHOULD STOP TAKING MONEY OUT OF A SPECIAL FUND ACCOUNTS TO TRY. TO COVER THE COST OF THIS BECAUSE IT DEPRIVES THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE OPERA SUPPOSED TO BE PAID FOR BY THE SPECIAL FUNDS. THE TYPE OF SERVICES REQUIRED AND SO -- WE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING MONEY TO HELP FOLKS TO GROUP WHEN IT RESPONSIBLY ON WEAPONS. TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM THAT PURPOSE SO THEY CAN REGISTER THEM STAY LICENSE AND SO FORTH -- SO FOR THE PURPOSE OF HELPING -- APPREHEND THOSE WHO ARE ILLEGALLY IN POSSESSION OF WEAPONS AND SO THEY SHOULD HELP US -- IT TAKES A LONG WAY I SHOULD MENTION AS WELL THAT THE THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES -- IT NOW WILL BE ABLE TO GET FROM UNDER THE THE WHOLE IT WAS IN BECAUSE OF LOSS OF MONEY THAT WAS COMING INTO THE DNA ID FUND AS A RESULT PROP. FORTY SEVEN YOU MAY RECALL WE ARE NOW RECEIVING LESS MONEY INTO THE DNA ID FUND WHICH MEANS -- FEWER DOLLARS TO PROVIDE THE FORENSIC SERVICES WE WERE EITHER FACING HAVING TO CUT FORENSIC SERVICES WOULD MEAN WHICH WOULD MEAN CUTTING. FORENSIC SERVICES FOR A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT THE GOVERNOR CAME THROUGH AND HAS HELPED US NOW TRY TO GET THAT. ON OF OUR FIRM FOOTING HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH I'VE EXPRESSED IN THE PAST. CALIFORNIA'S GROUND ZERO FOR THAT THERE'S NO STATE THAT HAS -- HIGHER LEVELS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR SEX FOR LABOR THE CALIFORNIA WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE OUR ACTIVITY THERE WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO GO AFTER THAT BECAUSE TRULY THE VICTIMS ARE JUST THE FOLKS. WHO LOSE THEIR FAMILY MEMBER TO SIX TRAFFIC IT'S THE FOR THOSE WHO ARE BETTER BEANS TRAFFIC IT WHO ARE THE BIGGEST VICTIMS IT'S WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT AS WELL? OUR FINALLY I JUST MENTION A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT I I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP INTO A I TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. WHEN WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MOVE FORWARD WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE AGGRESSIVELY -- I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR WOMAN HERE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT THE CAL GAME PROGRAM AND CLEARLY THROUGH THE STATE AUDITOR WE FOUND OUT THERE WERE SOME. MAJOR FLAWS IN THE SYSTEM. AND WE WERE HOPING TO TRY TO CURE THAT BUT WITHOUT RESOURCES WOULD BE DIFFICULT -- THIS LEGISLATURE PROVIDED US WITH RESOURCES SO NOW WE'RE TACKLING THAT AND WE'RE HOPING TO SOON BE ABLE TO COME OUT WITH A SCRUB OF A CAL GAINES PROGRAM SO THAT. PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA BE CLASSIFIED ARE CLASSIFIED THE JET BUT THE NOT IN HARM CAN IN. VIOLATION OF THEIR RIGHTS SO THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT HAVE THE DOLLARS TO DO THAT WE'RE NOW AT THE SAME TIME ALONG THE SAME LINES TRY TO MONITOR MODERNIZE OUR FIREARM IT SYSTEMS SO WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE WHETHER IT'S WITH THE APP'S PROGRAM. OR MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE LAWFULLY REGISTRY WEAPONS AND RESPONSIBLY TAKING CARE OF THOSE WEAPONS THAT THEY WE THEY ARE TRACK WELL SO WE DON'T -- FIND OURSELVES -- TRACKING THEM FOR THE WRONG REASONS ARE WE'RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AS HE CCPA. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WE TRY TO WRITE THE RAGS. ARE WE TRYING TO MANAGE A REGISTRATION OF KNOWN SEX OFFENDER TO TO THIS NEW TIERED SYSTEM WHICH IS A A BEAR OF A TASK BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER DONE THIS. AND WE CAN'T GET THAT ONE WRONG AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT. WHO ARE THE LOWER LEVEL OFFENDERS TO STOP BE CLASSIFIED AS THE MOST EGREGIOUS SEXUAL OFFENDERS BUT WE NEED TO GET IT RIGHT WE DON'T WANT TO PUT SOMEONE THE WRONG CATEGORY? BECAUSE THAT REALLY DOES AFFECT NOT JUST THERE RIGHT BUT THE RIGHTS OF A CALIFORNIA TO WANT TO BE SAFE FROM OP PREDATORS WHO ARE SIX TRAFFICKERS. I WISH YOU THE SEX OFFENDERS FINALLY I WANT TO THANKS OF THE THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS REGARD BECAUSE THERE WAS THIS ISSUE WITH THE WITH WHAT I CALL THE FIFTY FIFTY RAFFLE. THESE THIS IS THE MAJOR LEAGUE SPORT SPORTING EVENT RAFFLE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS SOMEBODY SPORTING TEAMS THAT WHOLE RAFFLES DURING THEIR GAMES. AND THERE WAS SOME TALK OF TRYING TO EXTEND THIS NOW MAKING A PERMANENT PROGRAM. WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO AUDIT. AND IT'S BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD THE RESOURCES TO DO THE ODDITY. WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE ARE NOW GONNA -- INCREASE THE FEES THAT WE CHARGE THOSE WANTED TO THE RAFFLES SO WE CAN ACTUALLY GO ON AND DO THE ODDITY SO THEY'RE GONNA PAY A FEE SO THEY CAN DO THE ARE -- THEIR RAFFLES AND THAT WAS A GREAT WAY TO RESOLVE THIS SO WE NOW CAN ACTUALLY TELL YOU REPORT BACK TO IN THE NEXT COMING YEARS. ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT'S BENEFITING CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT. THE FINAL THING I THINK I'LL SAY IN THOSE THESE LAST UPDATES IS. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD DO NECESSARILY RIGHT AWAY BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF AN ISSUE AND THAT IS. COMPETITIVE SALARIES -- I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW TOUGH IT IS TO ATTRACT THE MANY WOMEN IT TAKES TO RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM FELONS WHO ARE POSSESSING THEM AGAINST THE LAW. WHEN OUR AGENTS GET PAID FAR LESS THAN AGENTS IN OUR OFFICERS AND CIVIL CLASSIFICATIONS ARE AGENTS ALL IN THE IN THE APPS PROGRAM THE FIREARMS PROGRAM? THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES. THERE AGENCIES THAT DON'T REQUIRE COLLEGE DEGREES YET THEY PAY THEIR OFFICERS AND AGENTS MORE THAT WE GET TO PAY OUR FOLKS. TO SOME OF THE MOST DANGEROUS WORK I COULD SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT OUR LEGAL SECRETARIES WERE WORKING WITH ATTORNEYS AGASSI THE SINGLE SAVING ABOUT OUR OUR ATTORNEYS. WE PAY OUR HIGHEST MOST TRAINED AND TALENTED ATTORNEYS WITH THE MOST EXPERIENCE. AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT THAT A PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRM PAYS. A FIRST YEAR. LAWYER OUT OF LAW SCHOOL -- IT'S JUST. IT'S TOUGH AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN'T DEAL WITH DIRECTLY BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THROUGH THE SYSTEM. AND WORK WITH CAL HR -- HUMAN RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN BUT IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE GOOD ABOUT GIVING ME RESOURCES THE HIGHER UP TO DEAL WITH APPS FOR TO DEAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT. REGULATIONS. BUT I CAN'T GET TELL THE PEOPLE TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH FOR THEM TO LEAVE WHAT THEY'VE GOT. AND TAKE A PAY CUT TO COME AND DO IT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING JUST PAID ATTENTION TO SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. CAN RIGHTLY SAY THAT THEY ARE THE BEST IN THE LAND WHEN IT COMES TO PROVIDING JUSTICE. IN A CALIFORNIA A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH THEM AND IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH YOU. VENTURA TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MR TRAIN JOURNAL I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU THAT I'M SURE YOU'RE ANTICIPATING -- BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN YOUR OFFICE HOURS FOR TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE APP'S BACKLOG AND WE WERE ASSURED THAT THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. AND THEN THREE SO. TWO THIRTEEN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IN THE BUDGET YOU WERE GIVEN FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO TAKE CARE OF THE APPS BACKLOG AND YET THE NUMBERS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE IN POSSESSION OF AN ILLEGAL FIREARM HAS INCREASED IT HASN'T DECREASED AND I THROUGHOUT YOUR TESTIMONY I KEEP HEARING YOU SAY? THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE GIVEN THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED WERE SO MUCH BETTER ABLE TO DO OUR JOB WELL WE'VE BEEN GIVING. YOUR OFFICE RESOURCES. SEVERAL TIMES AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE JOB DONE. SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN AND DOJ OR DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB. A DIFFICULT JOB OFTENTIMES PARTICULARLY IN TRYING TO RETRIEVE WEAPONS FROM PEOPLE WHO PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE THEM UP THAT'S NOT THE CASE ALL THE TIME MY CONCERN IS HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS BEING MANAGED. IS THE ATTENTION ON WHAT THE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE DOJ NEED TO DO THAT THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE TAXPAYERS HAVE GIVEN. TO THIS DEPARTMENT OR IS THE ATTENTION ON OTHER THINGS PERHAPS AT A FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT IS DISTRACTING YOU SO CAN YOU ANSWER PLEASE WHY WE'VE GIVEN ALL THIS MONEY AND YET THIS BACKLOG HAS INCREASED. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DO LOVE TO GIVE YOU SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH -- SOME FACT SHEETS AND ALSO THE REPORT -- THAT GOES INTO SOME OF THE APPS PROGRAM ACTIVITY AND HISTORY -- I BECAUSE I THINK IT'S WORTH READING. FIRST I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT WE DID A DEEP DIVE ON THE APPS PROGRAM BECAUSE WE HEARD MANY OF THE MEMBERS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT WHY WE STILL HAVE PEOPLE. WHO HAVE NOT HAD THEIR WEAPONS RETRIEVED EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T HAVE A RIGHT TO TO POSSESS IT? AND SO I ASKED MY TEAM TO DO A DEEP DIVE SO WE GET BACK TO YOU SO LET ME TELL YOU SOME OF THE FACT THAT WE FOUND OUT. FIRST IS A TWENTY NINETEEN NOT TWENTY THIRTEEN IT'S A IT'S A DIFFERENT DAY AND IT'S A DIFFERENT PROGRAM QUITE HONESTLY FROM WHAT IT WAS IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN ARE FOR THEM TO GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE JUST EXPLAIN THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WE WERE GIVEN A NUMBER OF LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED TO HIRE FOLKS. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH TO HIRE SOMEONE TO COME TO WORK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS A SPECIAL AGENT TO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS WORK AROUND. IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WE TELL THEM AND BY THE WAY I CAN ONLY HIRE YOU FOR A YEAR. AND SO A LOT OF THOSE POSITIONS WENT UNFILLED AND AS A RESULT SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY GAVE TO THE PARTNER JUSTICE BY THE WAY BEFORE I GOT HERE. NEVER GOT SPENT ANY GOT RETURNED RIGHT AND SO IT WAS IT YOU YOU ALLOCATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT. BUT IT NEVER GOT USED SOME OF IT DIDN'T GET USED FOR FOR RELIGION IT RAISES WE COULDN'T HIGHER. UP FOR SOME OF THE POSITIONS THAT YOU PROVIDED US BECAUSE THEY WERE LIMITED TERM. CHECK I CAN I'M SORRY CAN I STOP YOU THERE IF YOU DON'T MIND MADAM CHAIR BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE OF THE MONEY WAS REQUESTED. AND THIS THE BODY WAS ASSURED. THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE AT HAND AND IT WASN'T SO WHETHER OR NOT YOU WERE THERE IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S THE SAME DEPARTMENT. I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT IT'S HARD FOR ME. TO RESPOND TO SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED WITHOUT A WIN IT WASN'T MY WATCH BUT I WILL TELL YOU THE NIGHT AND I SYMPATHIZE WITH YOU ON THAT I'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION I DO THINK HOWEVER -- YOUR LAST STOP NOW SO BACKSTOPS WOULD BE THE BUCK STOPS WITH YOU AND I JUST. I WHEN HERE SOMEWHERE IN YOUR COMMENTS SOME REASSURANCE THAT THIS TIME. THE JOB WILL GET DONE BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE WERE TOLD THE JOB WOULD GET DONE AND GET DONE IN THANK. YOU VAST YOU'VE NOT ONLY BE ASKED THE OF UNDER IS QUESTION YOU YOU VESTED IN A A VERY HONEST WAY. AND SO I WANT TO TRY TO GIVE YOU ES HONEST ANSWERS I CAN. OKAY FEEL FREE ARE BECAUSE THIS WAS IMPORTANT. WHEN WE DID THE DEEP DIVE THIS THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND [inaudible] ONE THE WORKLOAD CONTINUES TO INCREASE. TO THE HIRING HASN'T GONE AS QUICKLY AS MAYBE IT WAS REPRESENT I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT MAYBE THIS MONEY WOULD DO IT. IT DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE WE COULDN'T HIGHER UP WITH SOME OF THE MONEY THAT YOU GAVE US AND SO WE NEVER GOT STAFFED UP THE WAY IT WOULD HAVE. THE NECESSARY TO TRY TO REALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ENTERING INTO THE APPS SYSTEM. SO IT WAS TOUGH TO FINISH THAT UP BUT THREE AND THIS IS THE ONE ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHERE I HOPE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU WILL PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. THE WAY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO RETRIEVAL OF THESE WEAPONS. IS THE NOT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY AND EXPLAIN IT REAL QUICKLY. THE REASON WE CAN PICK UP WEBPAGES BECAUSE EITHER THERE'S A PERSON WHOSE A FELON. HE'S BEEN CONVICTED OR IS CONVICTED OF OF REALLY SERIOUSNESS TO ME. OR HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE A DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS RIGHT MENTALLY. FOR HAS ORDERS OF DOMESTIC -- RESTRAINING ORDERS AGAINST PRETTY CLEAR. AS YOU KNOW SUBSET OF PEOPLE. HERE'S A DIFFICULTY. WE WAIT TILL AFTER THEY'VE LEFT THE COURTHOUSE AFTER THEY'VE LEFT THE JAIL HOUSE. AND HAVE YET TURNED IN THE WEAPON EVEN THOUGH BY LAW THEY LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS THOSE THE MOMENT. THEY WE KEEP FELONS -- FOR THE VIOLATOR THROUGH A CUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TOWARD. WE'RE WAITING UNTIL THE LATTER PART AFTER THEY'VE. WHEN -- GONE BACK ADDED THE CALIFORNIA TO TRY TO DOUBT RETRIEVE THE WEAPON WHICH TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND QUITE A FEW MEMBERS MOST OF OUR TEAMS ARE FORTY SIX MEMBERS. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS WE'RE GOING AFTER THESE FOLKS. AT THE BACK AND IS THAT AT THE FRONT AND SO ONE OF THESE WE IDENTIFIER REPORT IS A RATHER THAN WAIT TELLER OUT THERE AGAIN LOOSE. BECAUSE THEY SERVE THEIR TIME BY THE WAY THERE'S TO PROBABLY UNDER PAROLE BUT THE PAROLE OFFICERS HAVEN'T SAID A TAKE. HAS THIS GUY TURNING HIS WEAPON GET. GOING OUT THERE DOING TOUCH AS MANY WE'RE GOING OUT TO THEIR HOME WE'RE GOING OUT TO THE RELATIVES WERE GOING TO THE WORKPLACE TO TRY TO GET THESE WEAPONS. HOW ABOUT IF WE TELL THE COURT BEFORE YOU LET THIS GUY FREE OR THE PROBATION OFFICERS BEFORE YOU LET THIS GUY FREE? CAN WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY TURN IN THEIR WEAPONS. THAT HAS BEEN DONE. UP FRONT SECONDLY THERE ARE CASES WHERE WE GO AFTER WEBER FROM SO WE WORKED AT IT FOR WEEKS THEN WE GO OUT THERE. AND THEN OFFICE AND WEBER SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO LOOK AT THE PERSON WE FOUND THE DUTIES OF TALK I TURN THAT WEAPON IN THREE MONTHS AGO. WHEN WE SAY WHAT YEAH YEAH I GIVE IT TO LOCAL? POLICE DEPARTMENT LOCAL SHERIFF. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PLEASE PART THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO NOTIFY US WHEN THEY COLLECT THE WEAPON FROM SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE APP SYSTEM. SO WE'VE GOT WELL THE WORK OF YOU KNOW. GETTING READY GO AFTER THAT PERSON. AND WE FIND OUT THAT THE WEAPONS IN. WE NEED TO HAVE MORE COORDINATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEN FINALLY. AND THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE I THINK FOR EVERYONE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO WATCHED WHO CHEERS FROM YOUR LOCAL FOLKS I CAN'T WE RETREAT THESE WEAPONS FASTER. WE'RE NEVER GOING. TO STAFF UP ENOUGH TO COVER THE ENTIRE STATE AND THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS TRY TO HAVE A BETTER COORDINATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO COLLECT ADVENTURE THE CASE THAT LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WORK WITH US WHERE WE COLLECTED. OVER A HUNDRED AND TEN WEAPONS. HERE THE DIFFICULTY. LA COUNTY CAN LAUGHTER SOMEBODY WAS ON APPS INTO THE MOMENT THEY STEP OVER THE STREET LINE. THAT NOW BECOMES. ORANGE COUNTY THEN THEY GOT A LEGO. WE DON'T HAVE THAT RESTRICTION AND SO. IT'S OFTENTIMES DIFFICULT FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY YEAH WE'RE WE'RE ALL IN TO TRY TO DO APPS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T GO AFTER SOMEBODY WHO THESE ARE JURISDICTION. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS CREATE A TEAM THAT WORKS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TRY TO APPREHEND THESE FOLKS AND WE CAN BE THE GLUE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE TEAMS ARE WORKING WELL TOGETHER WE HAD A CASE RECENTLY I THINK WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. AND I THINK IT WAS SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY THE GUY WAS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY HE SAID -- I GAVE MY WEAPON AYE AYE MY SISTER HAS A WEAPON WHERE SHE SHE WAS I THINK A CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. WE HAD TO SEND ONE OF OUR GUYS. ALL THE WAY TO THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO CHECK THAT OUT. BY THE TIME HE COULD GET BACK TO SING REPORT IT WAS. HOURS AND HOURS OF TIME WHY CAN'T WE HAVE A COORDINATION WHERE WE'RE WORKING WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY LA COUNTY THE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO THAT WE CAN DO THIS WORK FOR MORE EFFICIENTLY AND SO YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY LEGITIMATE. BUT I THINK YOU'LL AGREE THAT WITH THE WORK THAT THESE OFFICERS AGENTS HAVE DONE. NEVER ONCE IN ITS MORE THAN TEN YEAR HISTORY HAS THERE BEEN A BIT AND A DIFFICULT INCIDENT WHERE SOMEONE GOT HURT. AND WE RETREAT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WEAPONS I THINK WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT BETTER I'M BRED TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR RECOGNIZING ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT. CHENEY A QUESTION MR LACKEY. YEAH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE HAVE THE CHANCE TO INTERACT WITH THE HIGHEST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE STATE SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SIR TO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS OBVIOUSLY. THE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS A VERY PROLIFIC AND AN EXTENSIVE IT IN PASSING LEGISLATION. WITH COMPLEX GUN REGULATIONS. AND IF YOU GO TO YOUR WEBSITE TODAY. THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE THE COMES UP. TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE'S BEEN QUITE A FEW REGULATIONS THAT -- I'VE BEEN PASSAGE. TWENTY SIXTEEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE. OF WHICH WERE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. CONTROLLING -- ACCESS TO WEAPONS BY THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO USE THEM IN A DEFENSIVE MANNER -- WE GET WE STILL HAVE THIS APPS. SITUATION THAT MY COLLEAGUE. AND YOU JUST INTERACTED ON SO I DON'T THINK I NEED TO BEAT THAT. ANY HARDER -- BUT YOU KNOW. TWENTY THREE THOUSAND WEAPONS IS A LOT. AND IT HAS GROWN TO THE POINT TO WHERE IT'S EPIDEMIC. AND VERY THREATENING AND I THINK THAT -- WE NEED TO JUST DO A BETTER JOB I UNDERSTAND THE EXPLANATIONS YOU JUST GAVE AND I'M NOT HERE TO CHALLENGE THEM. I'M JUST HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I I HOPE. THAT WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT. A BETWEEN YOUR AGENCY AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE THIS IS POOR PERFORMANCE. JUST PLAINLY STATED THAT'S WHAT IT IS AND WE CAN EXPLAIN IT AWAY IN A WAY THAT'S JUST QUITE FRANKLY UNACCEPTABLE SO. I'M JUST PRAYING THAT WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AND MAKE IT A PRIORITY -- IN IN THE DAYS AHEAD AND THE THE FINAL REMARK THAT I HAVE HAS TO DO WITH THE YOU MADE A COMMENT ABOUT THE RAPE KITS WEIRD SEXUAL SOCKETS. MORE SENSIBLY STATED -- THERE WE JUST HAD A RECENT AUDIT THAT WAS REVIEWED. AND THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SAT WITH ME AS WE HEARD. SOME OF THE REPORTS AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- THE COORDINATION BETWEEN YOUR AGENCY AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AT THE VERY LEAST IS PROBLEMATIC AND VERY SCARY -- AND IT'S A DISSERVICE QUITE HONESTLY ANOTHER VERY BIG FAILURE. THAT -- I HOPE THAT. YOU WOULD SEE IT AS A BIGGER PRIORITY AS WE ALL DO I MEAN CLEARLY IT IS OF A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT AND AGAIN THERE'S EXPLANATIONS. BUT WE JUST GOT TO DO BETTER MAN BUT I I THINK THAT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT -- WE COORDINATE BETTER. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IT THE SAME WAY. THE RUMOR FACT BENCH IF I HAVE A CHANCE TO RESPOND LET ME A LET ME AGREE WITH YOU APART AND AND GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT EXPLANATION IMPORT. A AYE APPLET AGREE WITH UNITED STATES STARTED TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS RESPONSE UP EARLIER I THINK YOU'RE HAS BEFORE BETTER COORDINATION. NO DOUBT NO DOUBT BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO BE HERE TO GIVE ME ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THIS ON MY OWN. THEY'RE JUST NOT COULD BE AND THERE'S NO REASON TO BECAUSE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TOUCHES SOME OF THESE FOLKS. BEFORE I DO AND SO WE ACTUALLY SHOULD CORD. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S IT'S I WOULD CALL IT SCARY OR OF A FAILURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE I DID I WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT'S IT'S PART OF THE LEARNING CURVE -- THAT BOTH DOJ AND LOCAL LAW FOR TO HAS GO TO FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT NOTIFYING US WHEN THEY COLLECT A WEAPON THAT WE'RE GONNA GO OUT THERE AND HUNT FOR OURSELVES. WE JUST AT THE COURTNEY ACOSTA YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC WHERE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLECTS WEAPON BUT NEVER INFORMS US AND WE'RE AFTER IT'S SPINNING OUR WHEELS BUT USING TAXPAYER MONEY. TO GET OUR AGE IS READY TO COLLECT A WEAPON THAT ALREADY GOT TURNED IT. SAME TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE RECOGNIZE THAT HOW WE COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WILL REQUIRE. QUITE A BIT. OF WORK COLLABORATION BECAUSE THEY ARE LIMITED. IN CERTAIN TERMS AS I SAID JURISDICTION ONLY. WE ARE OF LIMITED BY CAPACITY AND WE HAVE TO TALK. AND SO THERE IS ABSOLUTELY MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING THIS. AND I WOULD AYE AYE INVITE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU. TO GO DO A RIDE ALONG WITH THESE AGENTS. TO SEE WHAT THEY DO. IT IS SOMETIMES VERY DANGEROUS. IT IS OFTEN TIMES VERY FRUSTRATING. BECAUSE THE THE THE THE THE THE LEVELS. THEY GO TO TO TRY TO FIND FOLKS. WOULD FRUSTRATE. AT BUT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BECAUSE THESE FOLKS ON THE LIST. AND THE MORE WE CAN MAKE IT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A SUCCESS. THE BETTER OFF EVERYONE HE'S. AND SO. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AS A MEMBER WE DO NEED TO DO MUCH MORE WHEN IT COMES TO COORDINATION. BUT I WILL TELL YOU. I AM ABSOLUTELY PROUD OF THE WORK. THAT THE FIREARMS EIGHT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT WE HAVE HAVE DONE BECAUSE AS I SAID PERHAPS THE BEST TESTAMENT IS THE FACT THAT NO. ONE HAS EVER GOT HURT IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING. THESE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WEAPONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT. GEN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IN A QUESTIONS. WE HAD A I'M SORRY MR TAKE NO GO HEAD NO GO HEAD NO NO YOU'RE FINE GO HIT. I I APOLOGIZE I'M FINE THIS -- IN MY IN MY COLLEAGUE MISTER LENSES QUESTIONS IF I END UP. REPEATING HER QUESTIONS YOU CAN JUST TELL ME YOU ANSWER THE MORE IT WILL FINANCE WILL GET BETTER I'M I'M SURE THEY'RE FABULOUS -- SO -- SO SO ONE ONE QUESTION'S GOING BACK AND FORTH AND JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF OUR STAFF ANALYSIS NOT TO GET. I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPS BUT SENSE I MEAN I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT APPS NEXT. I WANT TO JUST ASK A QUESTION OR TWO ABOUT THAT IF THAT'S OKAY -- I I GUESS WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE INITIAL DATA TO LOOK LIKE THE PROJECTED BACKLOG WAS GONNA COME DOWN EVENTUALLY DOWN -- TO ABOUT LITTLE BIT UNDER TWO THOUSAND BUT THEN I GUESS THERE WAS MORE INFORMATION SUBMITTED THAT SET THE BACKLOG WOULD GO UP TO THIRTEEN THOUSAND WHAT WAS THE AND AND I'M SORRY FROM LOOKING AT TWO DIFFERENT. CHARTS BUT JUST STONE YEAH. MISTER CHAIRMAN I CAN TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT THE OUT OF A GRADE WE WITH OUR REPORT THAT WE SUBMITTED. WE WE DECIDED. TO I ADMIT AS IMAGE BEFORE WE WE HAD A BORE DOWN. TO UNDERSTAND THE APPS PROGRAM AND THE TERMINOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE BACKLOT. I I'M NOT SURE IF WE ALL WOULD. THE FIND THE BACKLOG THE SAME WAY IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN WE SPOKE ABOUT BACKLOG I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT THIRTEEN ALTHOUGH THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CASES LIKE MIKE I KEEP A CRACK ME FORMA. ABOUT TWENTY KEPT THOUSAND CASES STILL OUTSTANDING. ALL THOSE CASES FOR THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WHICH PROBABLY WOULD NOT IDENTIFY TO FOLKS BACK IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THAT SAME INTERVENING AMOUNT OF TIME TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW PEOPLE HAVE COME ON TO THE LIST THE APPS LIST AS WHO HAVE WEAPONS THAT HAVE TO BE RETRIEVED. AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LIST TO REMOVE A LOT OF FOLKS FROM THE WHAT WAS CALLED THE BACKLOG AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM. HERE'S THE THING. SOMEONE HAS TO WAIT. IF SOMEONE GETS IN LINE AND AND WE'RE WE CAN'T GET TO THEM RIGHT AWAY. THEY BECOME PART OF THE BACK WHAT THEY MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN THERE FOR A MONTH. BUT WE HAVE WORKED THE SOME PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN THERE FOR YEARS AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO WITH. CLEAR UP WHAT THESE NUMBERS WERE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN. THE SO CALLED BACK WHAT WAS IDENTIFIED. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT WAS ON THAT. BACKLOG. HAS EITHER BEEN [inaudible] CLEARED. IS WHAT WE NOW CALL PENDING IF YOU LOOK AT A REPORT YOU'LL DO YOUR WILL BE CLIP PENDING MEANS WE TRY TO WORK THEM SEVERAL TIMES. BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAY FOR SURE. THEY NO LONGER HAVE A WEAPON SO WE CAN'T SAY THEY'RE CLEAR BUT WE CAN'T SAY THEIR ACT BECAUSE WE TRIED FIVE SIX TIMES. AND THEN THERE'S THE ACTIVE THOSE THAT WE'RE PURSUING. ONGOING AND IF YOU ADD THOSE UP THE ARE CLEARED. THE PENDING AND THE ACTIVE THAT WOULD OF SAID SHE GIVE YOU THE TOTAL NUMBERS. THAT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHAT A BIG CLASSIFIED PRINCIPALLY IS JUST BACK LOCK WHICH DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU CLEAR SAID BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED WE COULD BE GOING AFTER SOMEONE. WHO NO LONGER HAS A WEAPON? BUT WE DON'T KNOW IT. AND SO WE CAN'T CLEAR THE MATURE WE KNOW FOR SURE. AND SO THEY STAY ON OUR LISTING WE CAN CLEAR THEM UNTIL IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR AND SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND I HOPE YOU'LL READ THE REPORT. BECAUSE WE TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND WE WE IDENTIFY SOME OF THE WORDS THAT THE CUSTOMER NUMBER LACKEY TRY TO POINT TO WE IDENTIFIED THE WARTS IN THE SYSTEM THE WAY HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BEFORE. WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYONE CAN AGREE WITH THAT STANDARDIZED THE TERMS LET'S LET'S NOT. YOU KNOW LET'S MAKE SURE YOU'RE CLEAR ON WHAT THE NUMBERS REALLY SHOW BECAUSE THOUGH I THINK I THINK ANY ONE OF US WANTS. IS JEOPARDIZED THE SUCCESSFUL WORK OF THIS PROGRAM WE WERE FOR THE LONGEST TIME TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE DRAWS ACCOUNT WHICH IS THE DEALER -- RECORD OF SALE ACCOUNT SO EVERY TIME SOMEONE WANTS TO REGISTER. AS A DEALER OR EVERY TIME WELL A LAWFUL OWNER WANTS TO REGISTER. WE USE THAT SYSTEM. TO TRACK THEM. BUT WE WERE TAKING GROWS BUNNY WHICH IS TO HELP LAWFUL. POSSESSORS OF WEAPONS OR SELLERS OF WEAPONS TO GO AFTER THOSE WHO HAD ILLEGALLY MAINTAIN POSSESSION. AND SO SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING AND THIS IS WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID WHY SHOULD BE TAKING MONEY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE USED TO HELP WAFFLE FOLKS STATE. CURRENT STAY CURRENT AND AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE THEY'RE BY BYLAW AND USE IT TO GO AFTER THE THE GOT BAD GUYS. WHICH YOU GET MONEY SEPARATELY SO WE DON'T UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF THE GOOD GUYS TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID IN THIS IN THIS CASE HE'S GIVEN US BUDDY OUT A GENERAL FUND. TO FINALLY CATCH UP SO WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO SCRAPE MONEY OUT OF THE DRAWS FUND AND AWAY FROM THE WAFFLE. REGISTRATION ACTIVITIES WE HAVE SO WE CAN DO THE STUFF GOING AFTER THE BAD GUYS. IN AND SO THEN DE DO YOU HAVE THE SO SUGGEST TO RE. JUST UNDERSTOOD REPEAL CAN WHAT YOU JUST SAID. SO CLEARLY AS YOU FROM YOU EITHER -- GOT THE GUNS OR YOU FOUND THAT THE PERSON. MAYBE WHY YEAH DID THE DIDN'T HAVE WEAPONS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE CLEAR RIGHT OR I GUESS SOME PEOPLE NO WEAPON IN HAND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED OR IF THEY'RE NO LONGER PROHIBITIONS APART THOUGH THOSE ARE ALL IN THE CLEAR CLEAR. RIGHT SHE GOT PENDING WHICH IS PEOPLE THAT YOUR YOU YOU COULD BE WORKING MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE GUNS BE SINCE YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO THEM YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW IF. WE HAVE ANY AND WE ACTUALLY ARE NO LONGER WORKING AND BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN A BAY IT'S LIKE A WHOLE CASE. WE TRY TO TRY TO TRY BUT WE COULD ONLY SPINNER WITH SO MANY TIMES SAID SENATOR THERE'S ACTIVE ACT BECAUSE THAT YOU'RE ACTIVELY LOOKER WHAT'S. SAUCE I GUESS THE BETTER NUMBER FOR US WOULD BE WHAT IS. ACTIVE. WHAT'S ACTIVE SO -- A CASE WHERE WE ARE OUR ARE IN HIS OFFICE I DO HAVE THE NUMBER FOR WHAT. AND ACTUALLY LET ME ASK MARTY HER AND WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIREARMS BUREAU TO TAKE A SEAT WITH ME PIECE HERE. HE'S HE'S WALKING UP YEAH BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE YOU RUN NUMBER -- AND HE TO HAVE THEM. AND AGAIN THIS IS GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ANY REPORT YOU SAW TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE WE'VE ACTUALLY TRY TO BREAK IT DOWN THE HIGHLIGHT SO GIVE A QUICK EXAMPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THE STATE. WE DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION TO GO AFTER FOLKS IN ANOTHER STATE. AND SO THEY HAVE A WEAPON SO IN OUR APPS SYSTEM [inaudible] THEY EXIST. BUT I COULD NEVER CLEAR THEM. UNTIL THEY COME BACK INTO THE STATE'S RIGHT GO AFTER SO YOU'LL SAY WELL HOW WHY HAVEN'T YOU COULD BACK OUT OF THESE VERY -- CASES AND IN SOME CASES BECAUSE I CAN'T GO AFTER THEM. BUT IN THE TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY FOURTEEN REPORT YOU COULD NEVER IDENTIFIED LET ME OF MARTY GO AHEAD GIVE YOU THE NUMBERS YES I JUST BE GOOD TO KNOW BECAUSE OF WHAT'S. ACTED WHAT'S PENDING WITH CLEARED. A YES SIR SO IT AS OF THE END OF DECEMBER -- WHICH IS INDICATED IN OUR REPORT WE WE'RE DOWN TO NINETY FIVE DECEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN YES. WE'RE DOWN TO NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FOUR ACTIVE CASES -- BUT IN THAT PROCESS WE WE'VE COMPLETELY -- ELIMINATED THE ORIGINAL BACKLOG FROM TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD EXPLAINED WE TRY TO DO A BETTER JOB. OF EXPLAINING ALL THESE NUMBERS IN THIS REPORT BECAUSE WE COULD SEE IT WAS GETTING CONFUSING OVER THE YEARS WE KEPT TALKING ABOUT WORKLOAD SHORE BACKLOG. THE NUMBER WAS GETTING CONFUSED WITH WHAT IS THE CURRENT NUMBER OF ACTIVE CASES VERSES. HOW WELL WE'VE ATTACKED THE ORIGINAL BACK LOG OF ACTIVE CASES FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SUIT SO WHAT WAS CLEARED IN? TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TERM BACKLOG WE HAD TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWO AT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWENTY ONE ACTIVE CASES IN. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT CASES ABOUT ORIGINAL STILL REMAINING. IN KIND OF SPARSE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA YES I I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT CONFUSING THE GERMANS. MARTY THAT REFERRING TO WHAT USED TO BE CALLED THE BACKLOG RIGHT A CASES THAT EXISTED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WHICH DOESN'T. REFLECT THE NUMBER OF CASES WE HAVE TODAY SO STARTED TO BE FAVOR OF LET'S TALK ABOUT. FORGET ABOUT THE TWENTY THIRTY CHARACTERS RATING BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS IN THE BACKLOG UNLESS WE WERE RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA SO SO SO SO SO SO -- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL JUST TALKED ABOUT THREE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES RIGHT ACTIVE. CLEARED HANDY AND THAT DEFINITIONS BEING USED BY THE DEPARTMENT. WOULD ASK FOR ANY IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT YES OKAY. SO SO. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN HOW MANY FOLKS WERE CLEARED. AND HOW MANY FOLKS ARE. PENDING AN IMAGE CHáVEZ AT THE END OF DECEMBER IF I COULD MAKE SURE SO MARTY ANSWERS IT THE WAY I HOPE YOU'RE NOT THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO GET. TO NOT CLEARED THAT WERE IN THE TWENTY THIRTEEN BLACK Là CALL JUST CLEARED YEAH UNDER A NEW DEFINITION IF SOMEBODY IN THE COULD HAVE BEEN YOU JUST CLICK THAT YOU'RE DEBTS I THOUGHT SOUNDS LIKE THAT SOME OF WHAT YOU DID LAST YEAR WHICH YOU CLEAN UP YOUR DATABASE RIGHT. SOME PEOPLE HAVE PASSED AWAY THEY'RE OFF THE DATA THAT'S RIGHT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY WERE. BUT YOU DO WAY THROUGH AND TOOK A TOOK -- YOU KNOW SCRUB SCRUB YOUR INFORMATION AND TOOK SOME PEOPLE OFF. CORRECT SO INTO THAT BY THE END OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD CLEARED TEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE SUBJECTS FROM. THE APPS DATABASE IN AND THAT IS JUST IN THE CALENDAR YEAR YOU'RE TALKING THAT IS JUST IN THAT CALENDAR YEAR OKAY PERFECT. GERMAN ASK HOW MANY WE GOT. SO DIDN'T WILL ACT ACTIVE WAS NINE THOUSAND FOUR OF FOUR WELL IT AB I THINK WITH THE WHOLE. YOUR SIM THAT SAME YEAR OKAY WE HAD RECEIVED ELEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE NEW OUT LEVY THOUSAND HOW MANY SIR LEVIN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE IN THE CHAMBER THE POINT OF THAT SHOW YOU THAT WE COULD OVER. TEN THOUSAND BUT WE GOT NEW NOT EXISTED BEFORE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ELEVEN THOUSAND SURE SO SOME WOULD SAY WELL YOU'RE FALLING BEHIND AND IN A WAY YOU THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE SYSTEM. AND WE STILL HAD A CLEAR THE FOLKS THAT EXISTED FROM WAY BACK WHEN. THE AND THAT'S THE POINT THAT NEVER CAME THROUGH AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS TO UNDERSTAND. WELL WITHIN THAT THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'D BE A BE HELPFUL. TO ON AGAIN YOU YOU HAVE  BACKWARD LOOKING DATA BUT SAID YOU SORT OF STARTED LOOKING AT DATE A LITTLE BIT TO FLARE OUR STATE MADE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BREAK OUT MORE. RIGHT SAYS THAT THIS IS MUCH A LOT CLEARER SO THEN PENDING WHAT'S IN YOUR PENDING CATEGORY BECAUSE OF VESSELS INTENDING AS OF THE END OF THE YEAR WAS ABOUT. THIRTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CASES WERE IN THOSE CASES. YOU'RE YOU'RE JUST PUTTING IN LIKE A PARKING LOT BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT WORKING. CORRECT WE'VE ALREADY WORKED THOSE CASES YES -- SO THERE THE EITHER -- FALL INTO A CATEGORY OF UNABLE TO CLEAR. TYPICALLY THOSE ARE FOLKS WERE WE'VE MAY BE SEIZED ALREADY A COUPLE OTHER FIREARMS BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE OTHER ONES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AND TELL WEAKENED. RECOVER THOSE WEAPONS WE CAN'T CLEAR THEM FROM THE SYSTEM. THE OTHER CATEGORIES OUT OF STATE SO SINCE THEY BECAME PROHIBITED THEY'VE NOW MOVED OUT OF STATE -- WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THEM IN CASE THEY COME BACK INTO THE STATE BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT LIST DEPENDING COULD BE. FOUR MONTHS OLD. OR FOUR YEARS OLD CORRECT BECAUSE DOT THE WE CAN'T CLEAR THEM WE CAN'T WE CAN'T DISPOSE OF THEM. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT SOME OF THE CONFUSION COMES IN. BECAUSE FOLKS AREN'T TRACK IT FOLKS LOOKING AT THIS AS A STATIC NUMBER IT'S NOT STATIC BECAUSE EVERY DAY SOMEONE WHO COMES INTO THE SYSTEM AND EVERY DAY WE CLEAR SOMEONE. AT EVERY DAY WE MOVE SOMEONE INTO THE PENDING LIST. IN AN OF OF THE IN ON IF YOU HAVE THIS NUMBER BUT JUST. OF OF THE ONES THAT WERE CLEAR THE TEN THOUSAND SIX EIGHTY ONE HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE CLEAR BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY. SEIZE THEIR WEAPONS REQUEST. SO WE WE HAVE THAT BROKEN UP INTO THREE CATEGORIES FOR TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN TWO NUMBERS. SO FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO WERE DISARMED THIS ORDER. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT PASSED AWAY SOUTHERN STATE THEY COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT HAD EXPIRED PROHIBITIONS SO THEY COME OUT OF THE SYSTEM -- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE BACK AND FORTH QUESTION ANSWERS THE IS. THIS SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT ARE COMING OUT WITHOUT ANY WORK BEING DONE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUE THOSE THOSE ARE CASES LIKE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO THEY COULD HAVE BEEN AND ARE PENDING SYSTEM FOR FOUR YEARS WE'VE ALREADY WORKED THOSE CASES AND NOW THEY WERE PARKED. IN ONE OF THOSE PENDING AREAS AND THE NATURALLY -- A PROHIBITION EXPIRES OR SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY THEY THEY COME OUT THEN. IN IN THE FOR EXPIRED PROVISIONS CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT BE LIKE EXPIRE PROVISION EXPIRE PROHIBITION COULD BE SOMEBODY THAT IS -- HAS A RESTRAINING ORDER ON THEM LET'S SAY A THIRTY DAY SIX MONTHS A YEARS -- RESTRAINING ORDER THAT -- IT ENDS IT COULD BE SOMEBODY THAT HAD -- MAYBE A FIVE YEAR PROHIBITION FOR CERTAIN VIOLATION MENTAL HEALTH SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE NOW THE FIVE YEARS HAS EXPIRED THEY NOW COME OUT. THANK YOU -- IN SO WITH -- YOU KNOW TO JUST TO JUST TO GET BACK ON MY MY OTHER COLLEAGUES COMMENTS REGARDING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THINK THERE'S WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR THOUGHTS AROUND THAT -- IT IS IT'S A TIME I THINK WHERE THERE IS SOME INTEREST ESPECIALLY SOME SOME LOCAL LEADERSHIP LOCAL LAW FOR SEPTEMBER DOES WANT. TO WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU SO WE WOULD LOVE TO FIGURE OUT -- WAYS TO EXPLORE SPECIALLY YOU KNOW WHICH YOU KNOW YOU TO LOVE TO GET ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND ALL THE DIFFERENT CITIES TO BE ON FOR THAT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN. SO IT'S JUST TRYING TO FIND WHICH AGENCIES WHICH DEPARTMENTS REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THIS SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN DIFFERENT APARTMENTS AROUND THE STATE'S REALLY HOPE YOU WOULD. YOU AND YOUR TEAM WOULD JUST. EXPLORE THOSE AND I THINK WE CAN WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON DIFFERENT DIFFERENT CREATIVE WAYS ON HOW TO HOW TO SUPPORT THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST. IN MAKING SURE YOU KNOW CLEARLY THESE THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN SHOULDN'T HAVE FIREARMS FOR THE REASON. THAT WE REALLY -- WORK TOGETHER STATE AND LOCAL TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT DISARMED AND THERE'S BUSINESS SOME REASON. THEY'RE NOT DISARMED I MEAN I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT MISTER CHAIRMAN ON THAT ON THAT POINT -- I HOPE YOU WHAT YOU'LL KEEP IN MIND. IS THAT [inaudible] LOCAL AGENCIES. CANNOT DO THIS THEMSELVES IF THEY TRY IF THEY SAY YOU HELP US BY GIVING US RESOURCE TO DO THIS THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THE MOMENT -- ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LEAVES YOUR JURISDICTION THEY HAVE TO STOP AND SO. IT HAD IF FORCES ALL OF US TO COORDINATE AND AGAIN TEN YEARS AGO THERE WERE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE -- OWNING FIREARMS IN CALIFORNIA. TODAY JUST TEN YEARS LATER THAT'S TWO AND A HALF MILLION. AND SO THE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING AND THAT MEANS MUCH MORE WORK FOR US AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT WE DO COORDINATE. AND COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THERE'S A QUESTION TO DETER THERE'S A REASON WHY YOUR YOUR THE HOLDER OF THE DATABASE. AND YOUR AGENCIES THAT ONE CHARGED WITH MANAGING NOW. HAVING SAID THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN'T DO IT ALONE AND THEY CAN TO THIS IS NO QUESTION THE SOLUTION IS AND EVERYBODY. WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE RIGHT NOW CLEARLY CLEARLY FROM A A RESOURCE POINT OF VIEW IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ADEQUATELY RESOURCE TO DO THAT THE CAN TO QUESTIONS IS -- WHAT MAKES SENSE TO TO GO WITH YOUR AGENCY TO SOME PEACE MAKES SENSE TO GO WITH THE LOCALS AND IT'S IT'S BUT IT'S REALLY A PARTNERSHIP? IT HAS TO BE WHERE WERE YOUR AGENCY WORKS WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES ARE HANDED HIM I THINK THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL FRANKLIN. SO. THANK YOU -- I WAS GOING TO SIMPLY MISS MISS MELENDEZ HAD TO LEAVE AND SO SHE ASKED ME -- TO ASK A QUESTION I GUESS -- YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE RETRIEVAL AT THE TIME OF OF THE DECISION THAT'S MADE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE. FIRE ARMS SHE WAS SAYING WHAT DO YOU DO FOR THE FIFTY ONE FIFTIES WHO DON'T HAVE. OF COURT DATES AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. IN MY PARTY MIGHT HAVE A BETTER ANSWER THAN I DO ON THAT -- I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NOW SHE'S THE SOME OF THESE FOLKS ARE WHAT THEY THE BURDEN OF FIFTY ONE FIFTY BILL KIND OF MENTAL. ISSUES THAT ARE THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE -- SHE SAID THEY'RE NOT BASICALLY ON AND IN JAIL OR UNDER SUPERVISION OR THEY'RE NOT IN COURT. SO WHO SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT THEM AND I I ASSUME -- THIS CONSIDERATION FOR THAT SO WE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT MEASURE WE WE WE CAN ONLY PURSUE FOLKS WHO UNDER THE LAW. FIT THE CRITERIA AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THE RIGHT TO POSSESS WEAPONS. AND SO WHETHER SOMEONE -- COMES OUT OF THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEIR TIME FOR EXAMPLE UNDER TO DOMESTIC RESTRAINING ORDER ENDS OR WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN SOME KIND OF A JUDICATA -- THAT THERE'S A MENTAL -- DISABILITY THAT MAKES A PERSON DANGER TO HIMSELF OR OTHERS WE CAN'T PURSUE THOSE FOLKS WE HAVE TO THEY HAVE TO FIT WITHIN THE DEFINITIONS OF THE SUBJECTS. THAT ARE NO LONGER ALLOWED TO POSSESS WEAPONS. YOU MENTION ANY IN YOUR COMMENTS. SOMETHING ABOUT -- I THINK SENT AND MY COLLEAGUE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT SOMETHING ABOUT THE RAPE KITS YES AND I I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THEWAS THE LAST WEEK WE HAD A REPORT CONCERNING THE BRAKE KITS. AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF THEM THAT WE'VE ORDERED MOST OF THEM TO BE TESTED. BUT THEY'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH SOME. OF ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT AND AND WHAT RESOLUTION. OUGHT TO OCCUR WITH REGARDS TO THAT WE WERE SOMEWHAT SHOCKED AT THE NOTED THAT THE NUMBER THAT IS OUT THE IN THE AFTER WE PUT RESOURCES INTO. OF TELLING FOLKS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE CITIZENS THESE KIDS NEED TO BE TESTED AND FOLKS GET UP IN TESTAMENT IN THE DO NOTHING WITH THE THE THE THE THE HITS THAT COMEY AND THAT COULD PROBABLY PREVENT. OF CRIMES FROM OCCURRING OR AT LEAST EVEN OF HELP FOLKS WHO BEEN UNFAIRLY -- CONVICTED OF CRIMES THAT THEY DID NOT COMMIT SO. OUT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH ALL OF THAT THAT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING FOR US TO HEAR THAT AT THE SAME TIME -- AT LEAST I WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE IS IS THAT IS THE ISSUE IS THE IS THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY. OF SITUATION OF THE DIDN'T HAVE A BACKLOG OF WITH REGARDS TO BRAKE KITS AND HAS USED A MALL FOR WHATEVER PROSECUTION AND SO FORTH AND SO ON IT THEY'RE GOING TO USE -- INDICATED THAT IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF WILL THAT FOLKS HAVE TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY TO GET THIS DONE AND I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS AND BILLS FROM WOMEN. IN THE ASSEMBLY OF GETTING THIS DONE AND SO WOULD NOW AT A POINT WHERE. WE STILL FIND OURSELVES A WITHOUT THE RESULTS THAT WE WANT FROM THESE RAPE KITS. VENTURE SO LIKE THE SITUATION WITH THE FIREARMS HELD BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED. UP. THERE ISN'T A SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO DO ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR WITH US ON THE ON FIREARMS. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE RAPE KITS THEY GO THROUGH THEM AS THEY DEEM -- APPROPRIATE AND SO THERE HAS GROWN UP A BACKLOG OF SOME OF THESE KIDS HAS GROWN. MANY OF THOSE AGENCIES. ASK OUR FRIENDS X. -- US BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES TO DO THE ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THOSE EVIDENCE KITS AND WE DO AND SO WHEN I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD WE ARE OVER THE COURSE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN PERFORMED -- ANALYSIS OF THOSE KIDS WE DID ABOUT TWENTY SIX HUNDRED SO THE REQUEST THAT WE GOT WE PROCESSED ALL OF THOSE. THERE ARE SOME AGENCIES THAT ARE STILL HOLDING SOME OF THESE KIDS. IN SOME CASES FOR A LONGER TIME THAN SOME PEOPLE THINK REASONABLE AND IT'S UP TO THOSE AGENCIES TO TRY TO GET THEM ANALYZED. AND SO THIS LEGISLATURE HAS TRIED TO PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR FOR THAT TO BE DONE SOONER AND IN SOME CASES RESOURCES ARE GONNA HELP SOME OF THESE LOCAL AGENCIES DO SO AS WELL. AND WE WE MAY RUN INTO A SITUATION WHERE WE CAN'T KEEP UP AS WELL IF TOO MANY THESE AGENCIES START COMING TO US. BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE FORENSIC SERVICES HAS ALREADY BEEN DEPLETED AND IT'S FUNDING AND SO OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ON MORE WILL BE STRAPPED UNLESS WE CONTINUE. TO GET THE RESOURCES WE NEED. OKAY. WELL I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO AT IN IN LISTENING -- LAST WEEK TO THE TO IT -- I GUESS AT SOME POINT THIS BODY WILL HAVE. TO DO SOMETHING IN TERMS OF THAT ONLY BUDGET BUT BUDGET LANGUAGE. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO DO A TO FOLLOW DO THE FOLLOW THROUGH. YOU KNOW AS I POINTED OUT REMINDS ME WHEN YOU TELL YOU KßT. TO SWEEP BECAUSE THEY DROP SOMETHING A SUITE THAT ONE SPOT MANDATE THAT DONE INVEST A HOUSE LOOK LIKE A DISASTER. AND AND AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE SAME WE TOLD ME OF TEST THE TEST. YOU KNOW LOGIC IS THAT DO BEEN TAKE IT INTO TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING WITH REGARDS TO FUNDING BUT ALSO BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THEM TO TAKE IT TO ITS FULL IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE PURPOSE OF OF DOING THE TEST IS TO HOPEFULLY TO PROVE FIGURE OUT WHO'S COMMITTING THE CRIMES AND AND PICK THESE FOLKS UP AS WELL AS TO EXONERATE FOLKS DIDN'T COMMIT THE CRIME I MEAN. THAT'S THE LOGIC BEHIND IT AND AND YET ARE WE GETTING IS IS THE TEST THEY'RE BEING TESTED BECAUSE WE TOLD MODESTO. AND THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE HITS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM THE REPORT THAT WE GOT. IN LAST WEEK AND SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF DISHEARTENING AFTER SO MANY YEARS OF OF I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT WHICH HAS BEEN SEVERAL WEEKS YEARS AGO NOW. AND WE STILL A POOR ALMOST AT THE SAME SPOT WITH REGARDS TO PEOPLE FOLLOWING THROUGH AS WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOGICALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ONCE THEY GOT YOUR OFFICE AND OTHERS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH THE INFORMATION. BUT IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SOME OUT OF THE CORD NATION NOT TRICKLING DOWN AND AND ACCOMPLISHING THE GOALS THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD ACCOMPLISH. BY GETTING THE TEST THAT -- BUT THAT WE SAW WHAT CAN HAPPEN IS WITH THE ONE BE A WHO ACTUALLY MADE IT A PRIORITY TO COMMITMENT. TO GET THE TEST HOPE THINGS DONE AND TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT AND AND TO HAVE NO BACKLOG IN IN THE BAY AREA WITH WITH REGARDS -- TO THE RAPE KITS AND THE FOLLOW THROUGH AND HITS AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE THOUGHT WOULD PEOPLE WOULD DO. YOU KNOW BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD A COMMITMENT TO GET IT DONE. SO WHAT WILL FIT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES MISTER JONES SAWYER. IT IS OCT. I APOLOGIZE FOR FOR BEING SO LATE AND IF THIS. QUESTION IS ALREADY BEEN BEEN ASSN ANSWER OUT OF A WASH THE FILLMORE SMOKES PLAYED TO ME LATER -- IT'S NOT JUST FIRST MAKE MAKE A COMMENT ON THE ARM TO PROHIBIT PERSON SYSTEM -- GOOD TO SEE YOU MISTER DURING GENERAL OF I'VE HAD. IN PUBLIC SAFETY POLICY -- I'VE HAD MEMBERS WANTING TO CREATE THEIR OWN [inaudible] INDIVIDUAL [inaudible] DEPARTMENT -- APPS SYSTEM OR WHATEVER. AND I'VE OF KIND OF HELD IT BACK BECAUSE OF FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. AND ALSO FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE OF ALWAYS FELT THAT -- I THINK I TELL YOU THAT THAT I I PREFER ONE PERSON TO BLAME ONE PERSON TO GET SUCCESS. OF WHEN YOU SPREAD THINGS OVER. DIFFERENT SHERIFFS ARE DIFFERENT AGENCIES ARM WHEN -- SOMEONE ASKED WHY DIDN'T WORK PEOPLE STOP POINTING FINGERS AND YOU GOT. YOU KNOW FOR FIVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES WORKING ON THIS AND FOUR OUT OF FIVE OUR SUCCESSFUL -- YOU'VE GOT TO BLAME FOR PEOPLE FIVE PEOPLE WHAT THE ART YOU GO BACK TO LEGISLATION SO WHY DO YOU DO THAT THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO ON I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS -- I WAS HERE. IN TWENTY TWELVE TALKING ABOUT THIS. AND MIGHT MIGHT. ONE I'M LETTING YOU KNOW THAT -- IS PROBABLY SOME MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY NOT VERY HAPPY WITH ME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING. THIS BECAUSE I FIRMLY BUT DO BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD BE REST IN. ONE DEPARTMENT ONE ONE AREA I THINK YOU WERE WILD WHEN I CAME IN YOU CAN I ANSWERED SOME OF THE REASONS WHY WE NEED TO GET THAT OUT TO OTHER MEMBERS. A WIDE IS IS MORE IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT FOCUS UNDER ONE PERSON'S LEADERSHIP. OTHERWISE -- IT STILL MAY NOT GET DONE -- THAT'S ONE THING AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU DO ACTUALLY WORK WITH LOCAL MISS BELLY TO MAKE SURE IT GETS DONE -- THAT AND IN MY ONLY QUESTION IS -- WHAT'S WHAT IS WHAT WILL BE THE DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN WHAT THE EFFORT THAT WAS DONE BACK IN 200-012-1314. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YOU CAME ON WHAT. SEVENTEEN WHAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE MONEY WE PUT IN LAST TIME THAT THE ACTIVITY WE PUT AWAY WHAT IS. WHAT IS THAT DELTA DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO? AND WHAT WAS ATTEMPTED BEFORE TO GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO GO. SOME REMEMBER AS A GREAT QUESTION AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT. MY HOPE IS THAT WHAT WE CAN PRODUCE FOR MOVING FORWARD IF WE GET THIS UP BUDGET REQUEST IT HELPS TO SORT OF BUT THE DECK IN ORDER. IS EFFICIENCY THAT WE WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO COORDINATE WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU MAKE YOU WE MIGHT NEED YOUR HELP. TO THE TOP. GIVE A PUSH TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EIGHTY TO WANT TO DO THIS THEY'RE GONNA COME TO YOU AND RIGHTFULLY SO MANY CASES SAY. YOU WANT US TO GET INVOLVED IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME RESOURCES BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE GO RETRIEVE A WEAPON. WE'RE NOT HAVING SOMEBODY PATROL STREET. AND SO IT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO COORDINATE SO IT. LOOKS LIKE MY ARM. TECH APPREHEND FOLKS. IS MUCH LONGER AND BIGGER AND WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WITH THE FEW TEAMS I HAVE TO DO THIS. FOLKS KNOW IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH FOR ME TO FIND. BUT IF I KNOW THERE'S A NETWORK OUT THERE THAT I'M WORKING WITH THAT WE'RE COORDINATING OFFICIALLY. THAT'S WHAT REALLY WORKS FIRST IS AS YOU SAID IF ONE AGENCY SAID LET ME TAKE IT ALL ON MY OWN. AND THEN THE MOMENT THAT PERSON'S STEPS OVER THE BOUNDARY THAT PERSON'S JURISDICTION YOU KNOW LA COUNTY SHERIFF. CAN'T GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY AS I SAID BEFORE AND THEY ALL THEY KNOW IS THAT THE BAD GUYS KNOW THE AGE THAT THE STEP OVER THE COUNTY LINE. AND THE CASHIER CAN'T TOUCH HIM ANYMORE. BE IT BECOMES INEFFICIENT AND SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS COORDINATE SO THAT. LA COUNTY SAYS I'M ABOUT THE PURSUE SOMEBODY LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT THE GOING TO ORANGE COUNTY AS TO HOW WE GOT A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH ORANGE COUNTY ORANGE COUNTY. TAKES OVER FROM THERE AND THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO MY TEAM DOES IT HAVE TO ALWAYS BE ON THE GROUND. BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT THERE'S GOT TO BE -- SOMEONE AT THE POINT OF THE SPEAR AND THAT'S WHERE SPECIAL AGENTS HAVE BEEN AT THE POINT OF THE SPEAR AND WITH YOUR HELP WHAT WILL END UP DOING I HOPE IS COORDINATING. AND WITH YOUR HELP ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DIRECTLY DO. BUT MAYBE THE MORAL SUASION YOU CAN PROVIDE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE RECOGNIZES THAT I CAN'T DO SOMETHING. WHEN I GATICA A MEDIC COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TRYING TO GET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT WORK? AND IF I CAN'T BE MY AGENT SOMETHING NEAR WHAT THEY DESERVE GIVEN THAT THE HEIGHT OF DANGER THAT THEY'RE IN -- I'M NOT GONNA GET A AND SO WE WE JUST NEED TO MAKE IT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT. WE WANT TO WE WANT TO GET THE BEST. HARD TO GET THE BEST IF I PAY THE WORST. WELL IS WITH THE WITH THE TESTING A RAPE KIT -- WE COULD PROVIDE. ALL THE MONIES THAT WE NEED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT COOPERATING IF YOU'RE NOT DOING YOU KNOW I'VE THE REASON I'M LATE. IS BECAUSE OF A A BILL I'M WORKING ON IN THE MORNING AT EIGHT THIRTY WERE BY -- I THINK THIS COMMITTEE GAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO HELP RESOLVE JUMPING AND HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT DO IT ON THEIR OWN. WHICH THEY DIDN'T TOUCH. IN SOME ALSO WORRIED ABOUT GIVING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THEN HAVE THEM NOT USE. YOU DO WE GIVE YOU ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED. BUT THEN THEY DON'T CONNECT WITH YOU SO IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE THAN JUST. YOU IT'S IS ALSO THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MAKING THIS A PRIORITY. AREN'T MAKING IS SOMETHING THAT. UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP THEY WILL MOVE FORWARD WITH. AND SO -- WE WE WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT TOO BECAUSE THAT'S OTHERWISE WE HAVE. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT IS EITHER UNSPENT. OR MISUSED. AND WE STILL ARE AT THE SAME PLACE THAT WE ARE HERE RIGHT NOW AND SO -- THERE MAY BE SOME LEGISLATION THAT WE NEED OTHER THAN GIVING MONEY WE MAY NEED SOME LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. SAID AND I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT. TO HELP ENSURE THAT THIS GETS DONE. SOMETIMES SOME. LIKE DOCTOR WEBER SAYS YOU EVEN LET [inaudible] YOUR KIDS. MEMBERS WITH THE WHOLE HOUSE. YOU CAN SAY LET'S GET THIS DONE AND THEN YOU LOOK AROUND IT'S NOT QUITE. DONE INSULT THIS IS SO THIS IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE OF BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE. THAT -- I THINK WE CAN WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THIS GETS DONE. THANK AGREE THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION. YEAH I JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY THOUGH THE ONE POINT THAT I MADE ABOUT -- IF YOU GO TO THE WEBSITE WE HAVE SOME PRETTY OUTDATED CIRCUMSTANCES HERE BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS TRY TO DO IS TO IS TO COMPLY. M. WHEN GUN OWNERS HAVE THEIR REQUIRED TO DISPLAY THIS VERY STATEMENT. CALIFORNIA'S STRICT GUN LAWS PERTAINING TO FIRE ARMS A NEW WAVE. YOU MAY BE FINED OR IMPRISONED IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THEM. VISIT THE WEBSITE OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. AND AS I INDICATED. THIS IS WHAT THEY'LL GET. TWENTY SIXTEEN YOUR NAME'S NOT EVEN ON THERE SIR -- SO. CAN I GET A COMMITMENT YOU THAT THAT COULD BE UPDATED RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING RIGHT TO THE HEART OF WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU. THE DROSE ACCOUNT. DEALER RECORD OF SALE COUNT. WHICH EVERY EVERY RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNER AND GUN DEALER HAS TO PAY INTO. THAT MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR THESE TYPES OF SERVICES. BUT I'VE BEEN HAVING TO USE THAT GROWS MONEY TO PAY. FOR APPS PROGRAM AND OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT WAS SO CRUCIAL THAT THIS YEAR GOVERNOR NEWS RECOGNIZED YOU CAN'T KEEP DOING THAT BECAUSE GUESS WHAT HAPPENS. YOU HAVE TO HOLD BACK ON SOME OF THE SIX WHAT I WILL. CONVEY TO YOU IS THAT ANY LAW THAT NEEDED UPDATED HAS BEEN UPDATED. THAT -- DOCUMENT THAT YOU SHOULD DO THAT MAKE SURE TWENTY SIXTEEN I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THERE'S NO WAY I CAN ENFORCE THE LAW AGAINST SOMEONE IF I'VE GIVEN THEM -- INACCURATEINFORMATION BUT TO YOUR POINT. WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU PULL UP A DOCUMENT THAT DEALS WITH SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS BEING RESPONSIBLE WITH OWNERSHIP OF A WEAPON. WE'LL TRY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE IT'S UPDATE. YEAH THE PORCH I I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD NOT TO EMBARRASS OR OR TO SHAME ANYBODY IT'S JUST THAT THE FACT REMAINS. PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO BE IN COMPLIANCE AND THE INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM AND THEY'RE TOLD THAT IT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM. AND SO IT'S A FAIR THAT WE NEED TO AMEND IKE RIGHT AWAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER THAT YOUR POINT IS ABSOLUTELY WILL TAKE CARE THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU BOTH THANK THE MEASURE OF THANK YOU DISTRICT ATTORNEY JENNIFER COMING WE APPRECIATE IT ALWAYS WHEN YOU COME AND SHARE WITH US. THE UPDATES IN THE PRIORITIES AND WE'VE GOT TO DO AJAY'S BCP'S AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU REMEMBERING THANK YOU. OKAY THAT BRINGS US TO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA -- WHICH IS OUR SECOND ITEM. WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER TWO WHICH IS A BUREAU FAR ARMS ARMED. PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEMS INVESTIGATIONS ASSOCIATED BUDGET PROPOSAL SO YOU WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT APPS ON SELF. A VERY POPULAR TODAY -- WE HAVE WITH US TODAY -- HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OF COURSE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND IN THE IN. THE LA -- SO OFFICES USE WELL SO WE'LL HEAR FROM YOU FIRST YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I THINK THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE ON NOW IS THE APPS -- THE FIREARMS WORKLOAD PROPOSAL -- THIS REQUEST IS FOR FORTY THREE POSITIONS AND SIX POINT NINE MILLION. IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND SIX POINT FOUR MILLION ON GOING IN THE DEALER RECORD OF SALE SPECIAL ACCOUNT FUNDING. THE REQUESTED FUNDING WILL SUPPORT NINETEEN NEW POSITIONS TWENTY FOUR POSITIONS CURRENTLY IN THE BLANKET. AND TWENTY POSITIONS WITH LIMITED TERM FUNDING -- WHICH IS EXPIRED -- THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS A PERMANENT FUNDING SOLUTION TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU'S CRITICAL TIME SENSITIVE REGULATORY WORKLOAD WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE TEMPORARILY ABSORBED OKAY. THE CUT ANY OF THE COMMENTS. OF ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE -- EMMA GENWORTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT'S TWO QUICK THINGS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE FIRST -- IS A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LA -- WHICH MISLI IS ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT -- IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR THAT DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT ON SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS. THE SHORTFALLS OF TO FIRE RELATED SPECIAL FUNDS I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT -- HER RECOMMENDATION -- INCLUDES A DECEMBER FIFTEENTH REPORTING DATE. AND WE DO HAVE CONCERNS OF THAT DAY ONLY BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE TO PREEMPT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO IN THESE TYPE OF REPORTING ABOUT. SHOULD GENERALLY FALL WITHIN JANUARY'S TIME FRAME -- THE SECOND IS REGARDING THE FUNDING FOR THE APPS INVESTIGATION TEAMS -- THE PURPOSE BUDGET PROPOSES TO SHIFT THE FUNDING FOR APPS TEAMS TO THE GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE A MORE STABLE FUND SOURCE FOR THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. AND TO ALLOW THE DEALERS RECORD OF SALE ACCOUNT TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL FOR FEAR OF FIREARMS WORKLOAD. WE ARE AWARE OF THE FUNDING DISCREPANCY THAT'S NOTED IN THE STAFF COMMENTS AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO RID TO RESOLVE THIS DISCREPANCY -- WE DID SEND AN UPDATE A PROPOSAL TO STAFF LAST WEEK A WHICH AT A HIGH LEVEL ALL THIS TALK ABOUT -- THE PER BUDGET WILL INCLUDE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION GENERAL FUND TO FULLY SUPPORT THE APPS TEAMS THIS INCLUDES BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AS WELL AS ABLE FINANCE LETTER. IT ALSO ELIMINATES THE ASSOCIATIVE SPECIAL FUNDS SUPPORT FOR THESE TEAMS -- AND THEN ALSO MAKES ANOTHER SECTION WITHIN THE BUREAU NOW SPLIT FUNDED BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT SPECIAL FUNDS. THE LEVEL FUNDING IS STILL THE SAME IT'S JUST TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES -- THIS UP IN A PROPOSAL WE THINK ALLEVIATES THE FUNDING DISCREPANCIES -- AND ACCOMPLISHES THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL OF PROVIDING GENERAL FUND SPECIFICALLY FOR APPS THE BEST ASIAN TEAMS WHILE ALSO PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR FUNDING ADDITIONAL BUREAU FARMS WORKLOAD -- LIKE I SAID WE HAVE SENT AN UPDATED PROPOSAL AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS FROM KERR ANY COMMENTS FROM YELP. I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK ACCURATELY SUMMER AS SUMMARIZED TO THEIR UPDATED PROPOSAL WE WOULD SAY BETWEEN AND THE JANUARY OUR OUR MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE JANUARY PROPOSAL WAS THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR THE FIREARM SAFETY ENFORCEMENT FUND THAT WAS FOR IN THE APPS INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS. WAS NOT. BEING TAKEN AWAY ESSENTIALLY WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT THE TEAM HAD MORE FUNDING THAT THEY REQUESTED. THE PROPOSAL BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BY BASICALLY SHIFTING THOSE DOLLARS TO SUPPORT OTHER VERIFIERS WORKLOAD. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE ARE GENERALLY AND SUPPORT AND WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTION OF THAT. PART OF THE APRIL FINANCE LETTER THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED IN YOUR AGENDA HIGHLIGHTS OF FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR SHIFTED CENTRALLY WHICH WAS ROUGH REFERENCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE DO -- RECOMMEND A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IS TOUCHING ON THE FIREARMS SAFETY ACCOUNT AND IT REALLY SHOULD. THANKS IN THE SHOULD BE THE FIREARM SAFETY AND ENFORCEMENT FINE AND SO WITH THAT TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT THEN -- ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE SOUGHT BY THE ADMINISTRATION FULLY FUNDING -- APPS THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND AND KIND OF MAKING SURE THAT THE OTHER PROGRAMS HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING WHICH WOULD BE ACHIEVED EVENTUALLY. WE TO OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS -- THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS -- FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DIRECT DOJ AND THE ADMINISTRATION SEVERAL SUBMIT A REPORT NO LATER THAN DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ON POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS MIGHT HAVE ON THE PROPOSAL THAT WE HAVE FORCE. OKAY COMMENTS FINANCE. I JUST ADD THAT -- WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH IS COSTING PROPOSAL MADE RECOMMENDATIONS LA L.. HOW INTERESTING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE'RE NOT RAISING CONCERNS WITH THAT PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FIVE YEARS OF FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEM WE ARE RECOMMENDING REJECTING THE ON GOING COMPONENT WHICH IS WOULD BE TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION ON GOING -- COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT BASICALLY EVERYTHING THERE'S UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE LEVEL OF WORKLOAD ON AN ONGOING BASIS BOTH BECAUSE THIS NEW SYSTEM COULD CREATE EFFICIENCIES BY -- TRADING OUT THIRTY THIRTY EIGHT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS -- FOR ONE COMBINED SYSTEM AS WELL AS JUST LEVEL OF WORK BUT IF THE CITY WITH MAINTAINING. THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE LEVEL ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING A SYSTEM. NEAR THE COMMENTS IN THE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. BUSH'S THEY'VE THE MEMBER -- ANY -- ANY COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THAT ITEM TO WILL BE HELD OVER. UGH I FINAL ITEM IS THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS HERE AS A AS WELL AS OTHERS AND FOR THAT ITEM THIS ISSUE NUMBER. SIX THIS REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND ON GOING TO SUPPORT PRE POSITIONING ACTIVITIES THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATIONS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND WITH ME I HAVE CHIEF MARSHAL WHO CAN PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AND MORE INFORMATION ON THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. THANK YOU TARA FOR THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM -- IN CALIFORNIA FOR NOT ONLY WILDLAND FIRES BUT ALL HAZARD EMERGENCIES WITH THE B. EARTHQUAKES FLOODS. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ANY TYPE OF EMERGENCY UNITS FIRE RESCUE RELATED. MUTUAL AID SYSTEM DROPS THE BOUNDARIES AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS RESPOND TO ASSISTANCE. THE REQUEST HERE IS FOR ONGOING FUNDING FOR OUR PRE POSITIONING SYSTEM. AND THIS SYSTEM IS REQUESTED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE CHIEFS. THROUGH THE OPERATIONAL AREA COORDINATOR. IT COMES FROM THE LOW LEVEL THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR HELP. AND THEN THE STATE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES WE FACILITATE THOSE REQUESTS AND WE APPROVE -- FIREFIGHTERS FIRE ENGINES. OTHER SPECIALIZE RESOURCES TO STAFF UP AN AREA THAT COULD HAVE A POTENTIAL FOR A LARGE SCALE WILDLAND FIRE. OR MAYBE A FLOOD OF THEIR THE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS IS THROW EVERYTHING AT IT. BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AND THE OTHER IN. HE IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP THE FIRE WILL -- SMALL. AND BY UP STAFFING PRE POSITIONING NEEDS RESOURCES WE HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THIS FUNDING IT HAS WORKED WE HAVE PUT FIREFIGHTERS FIRE ENGINES IN COMMUNITIES WHETHER IT BE FOR A FIRE OR EXCUSE ME A FIRE WEATHER EVENT OR A FLOOD EVENT. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND AGAIN IT'S THE FIRE RESCUE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS THIS. THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FACILITATES THESE REQUEST. AND SINCE WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM NOT QUITE A YEAR AGO WE'VE HAD NINETY NINE PRE POSITIONING REQUEST. AND THIS IS AN INSURANCE POLICY. WHEN PEOPLE HAVE THESE EXTRA RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITY IT IS TRULY AN INSURANCE POLICY? TO ALLOW -- OUR FIREFIGHTERS TO JUMP ON A FIRE OR AN EMERGENCY QUICKLY CONTAIN IT AND THEN BE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE SO THAT'S KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF OUR REQUEST AGAIN IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE THIS ONGOING FUNDING. SO WE CAN CONTINUE THIS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE VERY QUICKLY -- I JUST WANNA TALK -- ABOUT THE FUNDING IN THE ACTUAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE DEPARTMENT -- IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT -- YES RECEIVED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND -- IT WAS VERY LIMITED TO PRE POSITIONING FOR ONLY FIRE -- EVENTS -- SO AND I KNOW D. G. R. FUNDING IS A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA WHICH IS WHY THERE WAS LIMITED FUNDING EXPENDED THERE. I THINK THEY'RE STILL SPENDING OUT OF IT NOW -- IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT -- THE FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROVIDED THROUGH PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE HOW TO WRESTLING WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO USE ON EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS -- AND SO. I THEN WENT SB NINE A ONE CAME ALONG IT REVISE THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW IT TO BE USED ON ALL TYPES OF HAZARDS. SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS ONLY HAD JUST A FEW MONTHS TO START SPENDING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS DOWN FOR PRE POSITIONING SPECIFICALLY. HER ANY COMMENTS WELL L. JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS. ONE IS THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT DIDN'T COME WITH A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND SO WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS AS WELL AS OTHER PROPOSALS AND THAT AND THAT GENERAL -- CATEGORY OF PROPOSALS THAT DIDN'T COME WITH THE THAT DOCUMENTATION -- BASICALLY WE THINK IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE EVALUATE THOSE PROPOSALS. SO WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT TO SUBMIT FUTURE PROPOSALS THEIR SUBSTANTIVE LIKE THIS -- ONE WITH BUDGET CHAIN PROPOSALS THE SECOND JUST SPECIFICALLY ON THE PRE POSITIONING -- WE HAD JUST NOTED THAT IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE ON GOING LEVEL OF RESOURCES WILL BE NEEDED AS FINANCE INDICATED -- THERE IT'S CERTAINLY THIS IS A BREAK A VERY VERY NEW PROGRAM AND THE LAST TWO YEARS SPENDING BEEN PROVIDED THERE BEEN SOME REASONS WHY IT'S TAKING A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET UP. AND RUNNING BUT IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ONLY ABOUT FOUR MILLION HAS BEEN EXPENDED OUT OF THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND THEN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONLY ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION HAS BEEN EXPENDED SO FAR CERTAINLY THEY MAKE THEY MAY NEED QUITE A BIT MORE THAN THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT THE TALENT SO. WE JUST WANTED TO FLAG THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE OKAY. IN A CART QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS YES THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU I PERSONAL ME SAY THIS IS A VERY NECESSARY FUNDING IN THE FORTIES CAME WITH A BIT MORE LAST YEAR WITH WHAT THEY HAD. REQUESTED AND I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY THE CHALLENGE THOUGH. IN OUR BUDGETING PROCESS IS PUTTING A BLOCK OF MONEY THERE THAT'S WELL INTENDED. AND THEN BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS USED FOR AND THEN HOW THAT USE HELP SAYS PREDICTS. IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. AVAILABLE THAT'S ONE THING I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS REQUEST REALLY IS. BUT THEN TO GET KIND OF REPORTS BACK ON DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE OF WHERE TO PRE POSITION AND WHAT WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE. I CAN AND WHAT HAPPENED. NOT IN A WAY [inaudible] TO OBVIOUSLY BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT TO BE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS USED TO THAT AS THESE COMES THROUGH THAT WE CAN THEN. HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND TO USE THAT MONEY. I WOULD HATE FOR US TO BE. PUTTING THIS MONEY ASIDE IN THE DOWNLINE GET CRITICIZED FOR ITS AVAILABILITY. WHEN IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW IT ULTIMATELY GETS USED BUT I THINK IF WE LOOK AT IT AS AN INVESTMENT? IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND IN THE PROTECTION THAT IT REPRESENTS AND THEN BE ABLE TO TIE. AND SOMETIMES WE MAY HAVE SPENT SOME MONEY. AND IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO HAVE BEEN NEEDED THAT'S NOT A BAD THING THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD THING. BECAUSE THAT MEANT THERE WAS NOT NECESSARILY DISASTER OR THE DISASTER I'M HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO BUILD SOME CASES WHERE WE SHOULD THE DESK DISASTER WAS AVERTED. WHERE IF FIRE EQUIPMENT OR MERGED EQUIPMENT IS ABLE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM EARLY ON? THEN MAYBE WE WON'T SEE SOME OF THESE HUGE CORPORATIONS THAT. HAVE ENDED UP BECAUSE THE RESOURCES WEREN'T ABLE TO BE THERE. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE ARTICULATE THAT OR HOW WE BUILD THAT INTO. BUDGET LANGUAGE WHICH IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO HAVING A FUND AVAILABLE I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM FOR IT BUT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AND AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS GETTING USED AS AS MAYBE A PREDICTOR IN OVERTIME WE'LL LEARN MORE. AS A PREDICTOR FOR HOW IT MIGHT BE USED AND MIGHT BE BETTER USE THAT'S A CONVERSATION I THINK THAT. VERY HELPFUL AND VERY USEFUL SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TOOL. BUT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE AND THEN HOW TO KEEP MAKING SURE. THAT WE CAN BELIEVE SOME MONEY AVAILABLE WHICH IN GOVERNMENT PARLANCE IS A BIT OF A SCARY THING THEY'RE LEAVING MONEY AVAILABLE. HIGHLY. EASILY TARGETED FOR CRITICISM. BUT FOR US TO THEN BE ABLE TO GO BACK OKAY THIS IS HOW IT WAS USED THESE ARE THE BENEFITS THAT WE SAW FROM IT -- ALLOWS US TO KIND OF KEEP THIS PROGRAM GOING. DIFFICULT THING POTENTIALLY THE THREAD BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY VERY IMPORTANT SO I PREACH PREACHY THE PRESENTATION I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS EARLY DAYS. IN THIS AND THAT WERE JUST PUTTING MONEY OUT THERE BUT I FOR ONE WAS SUPPORT OF LAST YEAR OF THEM. OF THE REQUEST FOR THE FOR THE FIRE CHIEFS WAS WE ASK THEM. WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO HELP US PROVIDE SOME OF THESE AND THEY SAID HER MILLION DOLLARS? LESS PRE POSITION LETTERS USE THAT PREDICTIVE TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE OF WHAT THAT GETS USED FOR BUT I THINK. IF WELL SPENT WE CAN TRACK THE BENEFIT AND WE CAN SEE THE INVESTMENT. IN BEING ABLE. TO ADDRESS ISSUES BEFORE THEY COME BACK IT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO WORK UNFORTUNATELY BUT OFTEN IT MIGHT. SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE DO THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S A WORTHY INQUIRY AND SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY KEEP TRACK OF OKAY. IN THE COMMENTS ON THAT. I TOTALLY AGREE THAT -- IT IS AN INVESTMENT I CALLED IT AN INSURANCE POLICY. IT IS AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES BY BEING ABLE -- TO POSITION -- MORE RESOURCES TO HAVE THAT AVAILABILITY WE DO HAVE SOME IT SUCCESS STORIES THAT WE CAN BRING BACK IN AND SHARE WITH YOU. AND I THINK THE PROBLEM EMERGENCY RESPONSE AS WE DON'T HAVE THAT CRYSTAL BALL. AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. BUT THE STORIES THAT WE CAN TELL BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN A FIRE CHEESE BACK POCKET IN A COMMUNITY THAT'S FACING CRITICAL FIRE DANGER. IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER -- YOU KNOW WE WE CAN TELL THAT STORY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO RESPOND SO MANY MORE UNITS WE WERE ABLE TO CONTAIN THE FIRE AT THIS SIZE. AND WE CAN ACTUALLY RUN SOME PREDICTIVE -- MODELING ON WHAT THE FIRE WOULD HAVE DONE IF THERE WAS NO ACTION TAKEN ON IT SO I THINK WE CAN TELL THE STORY. AND I THINK YOU'LL BE QUITE IMPRESSED ABOUT HOW THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING IN THE SUCCESS THAT IT REALLY IS. BUT IT IS AN INVESTMENT AS YOU SAID. RIGHT AND DECISIONS THAT GET MADE BASED ON SOME OF THE PREDICTIVE TOOLS ABOUT WHETHER WIND PATTERNS HUMIDITY. AND EVEN THOUGH SOMETHING DIDN'T START BUT THAT'S WHY WAS THAT DECISION MADE AND I THINK THAT REALLY HELPS US BUT YET THERE THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES. ANY THAT WE SEEN OF ALL THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. FOR EXAMPLE I'VE SEEN AREAS WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LARGE FIRE AND AIR ASSETS THERE AND THEN A SMALL FIRE WILL WILL START. AND THEN BABY AND THEIR THEIR ASSET GETS. RE DIRECTED SOLVES THAT SMALL PROBLEM AND THEN BACK TO THE BIG PROBLEM. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HAVING EQUIPMENT NEARBY. AND USING IT EFFECTIVELY AND NOT LETTING SOMETHING SMALL GET OUT OF HAND SO I THINK WE CAN FIND THOSE BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW WE NEED THE TO BUILD THE CASE. TALK ABOUT THIS PROGRAM AND BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OTHERWISE THAT MONEY SITTING THERE THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE PUT TO OTHER USE. MIGHT BE TOO TEMPTING. TO EVENTUALLY SWEEP AWAY AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN SO I THINK WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. THIS EXACT CONVERSATION AND AND LOOK TO SOME STORES LOOK TO SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW IT'S WORK I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. YES SIR OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK AT I I I AGREE WITH OUR OUR MRS STONE CLEARLY THIS IS SOMETHING WITH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO AT SOME LEVEL -- BECAUSE I AT WE ARE. COSTLY PLANNING FOR WHAT WE THINK IS THE NEW NORMAL NOW WE HOPE NOT BUT UP THE THE FIRES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE OTHER DISASTERS AND THE FLOODS IN THE YOU NAME IT ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ARE REALLY ISSUES THAT WE FACE NOW THAT WE DIDN'T THINK WE'D HAVE TO FACE BEFORE. WE'VE GOTTEN SMARTER IN SOME AREAS YOU KNOW I COULDN'T REMEMBER THE SAN DIEGO FIRE WHERE. PEOPLE SPENT. DAYS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF A PLANE. OF THE NOBODY KNEW WHO'S WHO COULD GET A PLANE TO TO BASICALLY PUT THE FIRE OUT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY INSANE. AND SO FORTUNATELY AS A SAID NOW I LOOK AND I SEE THE PLANES ARE MOVING BECAUSE THEY GOT IT AND UNDERSTANDING. OF THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AND AND AND THEY'RE NOT SITTING AROUND DEBATING WITH A NOT IT'S THE MILITARY OR ITS IS THIS OR THAT AND IT WAS JUST THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IT'S IN SAN DIEGO WE HAD A FIRE AND I THINK WAS. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT OF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHO'S IN CHARGE OF PLANES THAT THAT THEY COULD GET THE WATER FOR TO FLY VER THE OF THE FIRES AND SO I I SEE THE COORDINATION. THE BETTER COORDINATION IT'S THERE AND I KNOW WE'VE DONE SOME COORDINATION WITH THINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WITH OUR SAID UNDERSTANDING AND MAPPING AND YOU KNOW THAT KIND OF STUFF. SO I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO WE JUST NEED TO TELL BETTER STORY PROBABLY BE MORE. DETAIL ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE DO BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT -- THAT WE PREVENT -- AS MUCH AS WELL AS RESPOND TO ISSUES THAT OF THE YEAR AND I THINK -- IF IF WE CAN. TELL THAT STORY THE PUBLIC TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY THESE RESOURCES NEED TO BE IN A CERTAIN PLACE THAT'S TO BE USED AS WELL AS TO SPECIFY WHAT THEY USES. FOR SORT OF IS SITTING THERE LIKE IN A BANK OF EMERGENCY BANK FEEL IS NOT BE IT'S JUST FOR PEOPLE TO USE WHEN THEY GET READY TO USE IT BUT IT. ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING OF THAT WE THINK IS PREVENTIVE WAR RESPONSE THIS YOURSELF HOPEFULLY WILL WORK ON SOME OF THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOING. TO DO THIS FINE AND IF YOU HAVE ANY INNOVATIVE WAYS AND OTHERS PLEASE LET US KNOW IT BECOMES IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS AND THAT WE DO IT RIGHT. YEAH.
