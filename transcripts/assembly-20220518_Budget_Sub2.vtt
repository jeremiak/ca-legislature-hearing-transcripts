00:34:50.488 --> 00:34:51.122
IN A GENERATION BUDGET AND I

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:54.158
GUESS THIS IS PART TWO OF THAT-

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.861
THAT- HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.563
INVEST IN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION

00:34:58.629 --> 00:35:01.399

WE'D BEEN A LAST TEN YEARS AS

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.402
FAR AS PER PUPIL FUNDING

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:07.104
ESSENTIALLY- DOUBLING IN THIS IN

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:10.508
THIS IN THIS- LAST DECADE OR SO-

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:14.045
SO BIG PICTURE SO WE CERTAINLY-

00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.714
OUR AGREEMENT THE SAME- REVENUE

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.150
NUMBERS FOR PROPAGANDHI EIGHT

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:21.319
GROWTH- I THINK WITH THE

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.554
ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT WE

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.289
HAVE IS A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE IS

00:35:25.356 --> 00:35:27.625
IN. ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME AND

00:35:27.692 --> 00:35:28.993
ONE OF THE ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.128
GET TO IN A BIT HE IS- WE'D LIKE

00:35:31.195 --> 00:35:34.098
TO SEE- MORE MONEY GOING ON

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:38.970
GOING TO THE BASE AND- YOU KNOW

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.104
WE WENT AWAY FROM THIS.

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:41.772
CATEGORICAL BASED PROGRAM A

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:43.074
DECADE AGO TO THIS EQUITY BASED

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.675
FUNDING FORMULA FOR A REASON AND

00:35:44.742 --> 00:35:46.511
WITH THESE ONE TIME MONIES I

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:48.346
THINK WE SEE A LITTLE BIT TOO

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:50.014
MUCH. AS FAR AS THESE ONE TIME

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:52.083
CATEGORICAL AS THEY SOUND GOOD.

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.784
BUT WE WE'RE SEEING DISTRICTS

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:55.353
AREN'T ABLE AREN'T ALWAYS ABLE

00:35:55.419 --> 00:35:56.988
TO SPEND THE MONEY BECAUSE THERE

00:35:57.054 --> 00:35:58.422
ONE TIME AND THEIR PEOPLE JEVON.

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.525
IDEAS AND SO- THAT'S SOMETHING

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:02.093
THAT WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:04.896
ADDRESS ADDRESS AND HAVING MORE.

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.797
ONGOING MONEY TO THE BASE- FOR

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:08.165
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO FOCUS ON

00:36:08.232 --> 00:36:11.302
THEIR- PRIORITIES- OF COURSE WE

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.070
KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE

00:36:13.137 --> 00:36:15.940
TO. BE MINDFUL AND DEAL WITH-

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.875
THIS PANDEMIC AT COVIDIEN YOU

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.045
KNOW TOO MANY KIDS. ARE FACING-

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:23.648
LEARNING LOSS AND- AND KIND OF

00:36:23.714 --> 00:36:25.149
GET BACK IN THE SWING OF THINGS

00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:28.119
AS FAR AS RECOVERY- AND THE LAST

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:29.820
THING THAT I DO WANT TO TOUCH

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:32.590
ON. IS THIS WHOLE ISSUE WITH

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:34.792
SCHOOLS HAVING. DECLINING

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.894
ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:41.799
VERSES- ENROLLMENTS. AND I'LL

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:43.100
JUST SAY IT STRAIGHT UP I THINK

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.435
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:46.337
GETTING SUPER DISTRACTED. YOU'RE

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:48.205
FOCUSING ON A FEW COINS ON THE

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:51.275
GROUND AND NOT LOOKING IN FRONT

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.176
OF YOU ON THE POLLS. WHERE THERE

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:52.843
IS HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.979
PLASTERED ACROSS YOUR FACE.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:36:56.180
BECAUSE WHAT THIS MEANS IN

00:36:56.247 --> 00:36:59.417
SIMPLE ENGLISH HIS WE HAVE FEWER

00:36:59.483 --> 00:37:00.651
KIDS. GOING TO SCHOOL BUT

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:02.486
BECAUSE OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT

00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:04.055
WE'RE GETTING MORE MONEY TO OUR

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.223
PUBLIC SCHOOLS SO. IT'S LIKE

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.692
SOMEBODY WHO HAS A JOB WE'RE

00:37:07.758 --> 00:37:09.360
GONNA GIVE YOU MORE MONEY FOR

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.462
DOING LESS WORK SO GRANTED WE

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:13.831
HAVE TO RECONCILE THAT WITH THE

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:15.099
PROP NINETY EIGHT BASE BUT THE

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:16.834
MONEY'S NOT GOING ELSEWHERE IT'S

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:18.836
NOT GOING TO. CORRECTIONS BUDGET

00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.871
IS NOT GOING TO THE RESERVE IS

00:37:20.938 --> 00:37:23.407
GOING 240% TO OUR PUBLIC

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:25.176
EDUCATION SO LET'S NOT GET.

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.811
SIDETRACKED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.045
WITH THE NATIONAL TREND WITH

00:37:28.112 --> 00:37:30.881
THE- DECLINING ENROLLMENT WITH-

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:33.951
DEMOGRAPHICS AND SO FORTH- WE

00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:35.286

CHILD CARE. WHICH WE WHICH WE

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:56.641

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.488
IT'S NOT A VERY COMPLICATED ONE-

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:59.022
COMPARED WITH JANUARY REVENUE

00:45:59.089 --> 00:46:00.991

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.487
FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:44.521
SCHOOL YEAR FOR CLASSROOM BASED

00:48:44.588 --> 00:48:46.490
CHARTER SCHOOLS ONLY. IN THE

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:48.525
AMOUNT OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

00:48:48.592 --> 00:48:51.561
THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO

00:48:51.628 --> 00:48:52.729
PROVIDE RELIEF FOR COUNTY

00:48:52.796 --> 00:48:54.898
OFFICES OF EDUCATION WE PROVIDE

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.566
AN ONGOING BASE INCREASE TO

00:48:56.633 --> 00:48:58.435
THEIR L. C. F. AS WELL. THIS

00:48:58.502 --> 00:49:00.504
WILL BE IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:06.843
HUNDRED AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS

00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:14.251
REGARDING LCF OFF. THANK YOU.

00:49:14.318 --> 00:49:16.019
HELLO AND IF I CAN I'LL JUST

00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:18.388
DIED FINISH UP REPRESENTATION

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.423
HERE I THINK THE TIMING OF

00:49:19.489 --> 00:49:21.258
FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.159
OF THE BIG STRUCTURE OF THIS

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:23.627
PACKAGE IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:25.395
BILLION AND TOTAL PROPOSALS

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.130
INCLUDING SEVENTEEN BILLION

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:34.504
THAT'S NEW IN IN MAY AND- AND

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:37.007
THEY WERE AT AND ON TOP OF MONEY

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.042
THAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.211
BUDGET- JUST IN TERMS OF THE

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:42.713
STRUCTURE THE BIGGEST ONE TIME

00:49:42.779 --> 00:49:44.147
ALLOCATION IS EIGHT BILLION FOR

00:49:44.214 --> 00:49:45.849
THE DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:46.917
I'LL THINK WE'LL TALK ABOUT

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:49.686
THAT. A LITTLE BIT LATER- FOR

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:51.321
THE ON GOING ON MEDICATIONS- THE

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:53.223
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:54.858
RECEIVES MOST OF THE ON GOING

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:55.892
INCREASE- THAT'S PROBABLY THE

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:57.160
MOST COMPLICATED ASPECT OF THIS

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.762
PACKAGE JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE A

00:49:58.829 --> 00:50:00.297
COUPLE DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:01.198
BUT I THINK THE WAY TO STAY

00:50:01.264 --> 00:50:03.233
ORIENTED IS TO FOCUS ON THE TOP

00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:04.968
LINE NUMBER IS ALSO UNDER THE

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:05.969
MAY REVISION AT THE TOTAL

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:08.171
FUNDING FOR L. C. F. F. WOULD

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:09.740
INCREASE ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN

00:50:09.806 --> 00:50:10.340
POINT TWO BILLION- FROM THE

00:50:10.407 --> 00:50:11.775
AMOUNT PROVIDED THIS YEAR GOING

00:50:11.842 --> 00:50:13.377
INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE.

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:15.545
AND THAT'S A INCREASE OF AROUND

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:16.513
TWO POINT NINE BILLION OVER

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.548
JANUARY AND THAT'S THE RESULT OF

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:21.318
THOSE- FOR ADJUSTMENTS YOU HEARD

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:23.353
LOWER BASELINE ATTENDANCE A NEW

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.789
PROPOSAL TO OFFSET THAT DECLINE

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.758
INCREASING THE STATUTORY COLA

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:30.327
FROM FIVE POINT 33% TO SIX POINT

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:32.329
56% AND THEN ADDITIONAL BASE

00:50:32.396 --> 00:50:34.564
AUGMENTATION ON TOP OF THAT

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.767
WHICH IS ABOUT THREE POINT 2% SO

00:50:36.833 --> 00:50:38.402
PUTTING THOSE THINGS TOGETHER

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:39.503
THE OVERALL INCREASE THE POLICY

00:50:39.569 --> 00:50:44.074
A TEFT NEARLY 11% FROM THIS

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.041
YEAR. THE COMING YEAR- THE MAYOR

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:46.943
OF ASIAN ALSO CAN. AN

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.612
AUGMENTATION FOR THE COUNTY

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:49.312
OFFICES OF EDUCATION- SO IN

00:50:49.379 --> 00:50:51.047
ADDITION TO THE COLA THERE IS AN

00:50:51.114 --> 00:50:52.682
INCREASE TO THE OPERATIONS

00:50:52.749 --> 00:50:53.984
GRANT. THAT WOULD AFFECT

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.452
DIFFERENT COUNTIES DIFFERENTLY

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:57.687
BUT WE THINK IT WOULD. ROUGHLY

00:50:57.754 --> 00:50:59.656
AVERAGE A 15% INCREASE IN THEIR

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:01.691
LCF FUNDING. SOME COUNTIES

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.059
RECEIVE THOSE INCREASES EVEN

00:51:03.126 --> 00:51:05.662
THOUGH THEIR FUNDING IS ALREADY

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.664
ABOVE THE LCF TARGETS. I JUST

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:09.599
TURNING TO SOME OF OUR COMMENTS-

00:51:09.666 --> 00:51:11.101
SO THIS AS THE CHAIRMAN CHEN IS

00:51:11.168 --> 00:51:12.669
THE LARGEST PROPOSITION

00:51:12.736 --> 00:51:14.070
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT KICKOFF

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.106
PACKAGE SINCE THE ADOPTION OF

00:51:16.173 --> 00:51:17.607
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT-

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.709
SIGNIFICANT NEW AUGMENTATIONS-

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:20.944
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME FEATURES

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:22.446
THAT WOULD HELP. US BUILD THE

00:51:22.512 --> 00:51:23.647
STATE'S BUDGET RESILIENCY AT

00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:25.549
LEAST WITHIN THE K. TWELVE

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.417
BUDGET. AND WE THINK THOSE ARE

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:27.984
IMPORTANT GIVEN SOME OF THE

00:51:28.051 --> 00:51:29.486
ECONOMIC WARNING SIGNS ARE THAT

00:51:29.553 --> 00:51:31.455
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:33.023
ABOUT FROM A FEW OF MY

00:51:33.089 --> 00:51:33.990
COLLEAGUES YESTERDAY- SO THE

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:34.791
BUDGET. ALLOCATES NEARLY FOUR

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:36.726
AND A HALF BILLION IN ONGOING K.

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.328
CALL FUNDS TO ONE TIME

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:39.396
ACTIVITIES. THERE'S NOTHING

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:41.331
PARTICULARLY SPECIAL ABOUT. THAT

00:51:41.398 --> 00:51:42.833
NUMBER YOU COULD GO HIGHER A

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.334
LITTLE HIGHER A LITTLE BIT

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.302
LOWER. BUT HAVING A QUESTION

00:51:45.368 --> 00:51:47.637
LIKE THAT GIVES YOU THE ABILITY

00:51:47.704 --> 00:51:49.973
TO DEAL WITH SOME KIND OF

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.041
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN A LOT MORE

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:52.809
EASILY- THE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:53.977
EIGHT SERVE ALSO GOES TO NINE

00:51:54.044 --> 00:51:56.112
POINT FIVE BILLION NEARLY 9% OF

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.214
THE GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWO

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.982
TWENTY THREE. THAT'S NOT HUGE IN

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.383
THAT CONTEXT BUT IT'S A VERY

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.318
HELPFUL STARTING POINT FOR

00:52:01.384 --> 00:52:03.286
MANAGING POTENTIAL VOLATILITY

00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:05.922
NEXT YEAR IN THE YEARS TO COME.

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:07.057
ON THE LCF WE THINK THE

00:52:07.123 --> 00:52:08.692
AUGMENTATIONS PROPOSED GENERALLY

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.427
ARE REASONABLE. I PROVIDING

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.895
INCREASE BEYOND THE STATUTORY

00:52:11.962 --> 00:52:13.430
COLO WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS TO

00:52:13.497 --> 00:52:15.599
SUSTAIN PROGRAM EXPANSIONS. IN

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:16.900
THE FACE OF SOME OF THE COST

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.935
PRESSURES THAT ON. THE CHAIR AND

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:20.437
SOMETHING UMBRELLA O'DONNELL

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:23.206
MENTIONED AT THE AT THE OPENING-

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:24.274
WE ALSO THINK THAT THE PROPOSED

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:25.642
ATTENDANCE- PROVISIONS ARE

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.143
REASONABLE. BECAUSE THEY WOULD

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:28.712
MITIGATE THE TEMPORARY DROP IN

00:52:28.778 --> 00:52:30.113
ATTENDANCE THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.681
EXPERIENCING NOW WHILE STILL

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.417
MAINTAINING A LINK BETWEEN THE

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.519
FUNDING AND STUDENTS OVER THE

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.320
LONG TERM. THAT WE DO HAVE SOME

00:52:37.387 --> 00:52:38.088
NOTABLE CONCERNS WITH THE

00:52:38.154 --> 00:52:38.955
PROPOSED AUGMENTATION FOR COUNTY

00:52:39.022 --> 00:52:41.024
OFFICES- THE MAY REVISION WOULD

00:52:41.091 --> 00:52:42.893
INCREASE FUNDING AT A MUCH

00:52:42.959 --> 00:52:44.828
FASTER PACE THAN FOR DISTRICTS.

00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:46.296
WE DON'T SEE A COMPELLING

00:52:46.363 --> 00:52:47.297
RATIONALE FOR THAT AND WE'RE

00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:48.498
CONCERNED THAT WOULD MAGNIFY

00:52:48.565 --> 00:52:49.966
SOME OF THE HISTORICAL FUNDING

00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:51.935
INEQUITIES THE STATUS TRIED TO.

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:53.270
EVEN OUT OVER THE PAST COUPLE

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:55.272
YEARS WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:56.139
THAT PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD

00:52:56.206 --> 00:52:57.641
PROVIDE AN INCREASE THAT'S MORE

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.543
IN LINE. WITH WHAT'S PROPOSED

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.845
FOR DISTRICTS- ON THE

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.281
DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROPOSAL- WE

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.081
THINK THAT'S AN IDEA THAT HAS

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:07.584
SOME MERIT- COULD HELP SCHOOL

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:08.218
DISTRICTS ADDRESS THEIR HIGHEST

00:53:08.285 --> 00:53:10.820
ONE TIME PRIORITIES- PERHAPS

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:12.622
COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE OTHER

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:14.791
ITEMS. ARE BEING PROPOSED-

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:16.092
DEPENDING ON YOUR PRIORITIES YOU

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.527
COULD THINK ABOUT PERHAPS

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:19.162
TAILORING THE INTENT LANGUAGE-

00:53:19.229 --> 00:53:20.463
PERHAPS ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.465
BASED ON YOUR OVERALL K. TWELVE

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:24.200
PRIORITIES. YOU CAN EVEN ADJUST

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.368
THAT PAYMENTSCHEDULE FOR

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.170
EXAMPLE IF YOU'D LIKE THAT TO

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:28.338
COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE OTHER

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:29.506
PROGRAMS. YOU COULD CONSIDER

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:31.708
DISPERSING THAT- ON THE SAME

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:35.312
SCHEDULE- AS THOSE ITEMS- THERE

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:37.147
ARE A FEW SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WE

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:39.616
HAVE CONCERNS- WE'LL TALK ABOUT

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:41.151
THOSE IN THE NEXT PANEL BUT

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:43.186
SPECIFICALLY. ON SOME OF THE

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:44.354
ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION FOR THE

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.789
TEACHER TRAINING IN THE ARTS

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.691
MUSIC SET ASIDE. WITHIN THE

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:48.625
EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.160
PROGRAM I THINK SOME OF THOSE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.995
MIGHT BE PREMATURE GIVEN SOME OF

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.363
THE FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY. BEEN

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.699
PROPOSED IN JANUARY OR PROVIDED

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:58.168
IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS- ONE OF THE

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:00.070
LAST COMMENTS IS THAT WE'D

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:01.438
SUGGEST YOU GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:02.973
POTENTIALLY PROVIDING. A LITTLE

00:54:03.039 --> 00:54:04.507
BIT MORE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:54:04.574 --> 00:54:06.276
EIGHT FUNDING FOR FACILITIES-

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:07.477
THE STATE RIGHT NOW HAS A

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:08.378
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:10.246
THAT'S AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY ON

00:54:10.313 --> 00:54:12.082
A ONE TIME BASIS. AND USING

00:54:12.148 --> 00:54:13.750
THOSE FUNDS FOR FACILITIES COULD

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:15.518
PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR SCHOOLS AND

00:54:15.585 --> 00:54:16.820
PROGRAMS THAT COULD LAST FOR

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:18.788
MANY YEARS. WE THINK YOU'VE GOT

00:54:18.855 --> 00:54:20.290
A FEW PROMISING OPTIONS-

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.825
POTENTIALLY HELPING DISTRICTS

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:23.059
OBTAIN FACILITIES FOR

00:54:23.126 --> 00:54:24.761
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. WE

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:25.428
UNDERSTAND THAT'S A KEY

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:28.498
CHALLENGE FOR DISTRICTS AS THEY

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:29.132
GEAR UP FOR THE EXPANSION. OF

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.166
POTENTIALLY PROVIDING MORE

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:31.067
FUNDING FOR DEFERRED

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.435
MAINTENANCE- THE GOVERNOR'S

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:34.204
PROPOSAL PROPOSED ONE POINT

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:35.939
EIGHT BILLION IS A GOOD DOWN

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:36.973
PAYMENT. BUT WE THINK THE

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.942
BACKLOG IS LIKE THE EVEN LARGER

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:39.943
THAN THAT. OR EVEN PROVIDING

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:41.177
SOME KIND OF ONE TIME

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.212
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR THE

00:54:42.278 --> 00:54:43.680
SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. I

00:54:43.747 --> 00:54:47.550
GIVEN THE DEMAND FOR ON GOING-

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:48.018
FOR MAJOR CONSTRUCTION

00:54:48.084 --> 00:54:49.419
RENOVATION. I THAT ADDITIONAL

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.121
FACILITY FUNDING COULD QUALIFY

00:54:51.187 --> 00:54:52.856
AS EXCLUDABLE CAPITAL OUTLAY

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:54.257
UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:57.293
LIMIT. AND THAT WOULD EASE SOME

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.495
OF THE PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL

00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.296
STATE BUDGET. AND LASTLY WOULD

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:01.598
POINT OUT THAT THAT DOESN'T

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:02.165
CERTAINLY DOESN'T NEED TO

00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:04.267
COMPETE WITH ANY OF YOUR ON

00:55:04.334 --> 00:55:05.468
GOING PRIORITY IS- THAT COULD BE

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:07.037
DONE ENTIRELY THROUGH SOME OF

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.171

ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS- FOR

00:55:11.675 --> 00:55:14.944
LCS AFTER OTHER AREAS THAT MIGHT

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:15.912
BE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES- SO

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.781
WITH THAT GOTTEN MY COMMENTS-

FOCUS ON THE FACILITIES

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.537
DISCUSSION I AM IN AGREEMENT

00:55:40.603 --> 00:55:41.504
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.540
BEACH THAT WE DO NEED TO

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:46.443
INCREASE- WHEN THAT ONE TIME

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:48.111
FUNDING TO DEAL WITH DEFERRED

00:55:48.178 --> 00:55:51.748
MAINTENANCE AND- AND FACILITIES.

YOU INDICATED THAT- AND THIS IS

00:55:54.718 --> 00:55:56.252
THE L. A- INDICATED. YOU DON'T

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:57.353
HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS ON THE

00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.322
BACK LOG IS ARE THEIR NUMBERS

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.191
OUT THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

00:56:01.257 --> 00:56:02.258
SIZE OF THE- OF THE BACKLOG

00:56:02.325 --> 00:56:04.260
WOULD BE. STATE DOESN'T COLLECT

00:56:04.327 --> 00:56:05.528
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:07.263
CURRENTLY AT SOMETHING YOU COULD

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:08.198
START COLLECTING MAYBE AS A

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:09.466
CONDITION OF DISTRICTS RECEIVING

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:12.335
THIS FUNDING- BUT WE WOULD NOTE

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:14.504
THAT THE STATE OF WROTE. ABOUT

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:16.573
TEN YEAR PERIOD REDUCED THE

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.241
AMOUNT OF FUNDING DISTRICTS

00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.743
REQUIRED THIS SPEND ON

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:22.178
MAINTAINING THEIR FACILITY IS- I

00:56:22.245 --> 00:56:23.847
THINK OF IT AT THAT TENURE AS A

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:25.615
COUPLE AT LEAST A COUPLE BILLION

00:56:25.682 --> 00:56:27.751
DOLLARS. AND SO BECAUSE AT THE

00:56:27.817 --> 00:56:28.885
STATE ONLY RECENTLY RESTORED

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:29.519
THAT FACILITY SPENDING

00:56:29.586 --> 00:56:31.154
REQUIREMENT WE THINK THERE IS A

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.357
FAIRLY SIZEABLE- BACKLOG. MAYBE

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.392
THAT QUESTION IS MAYBE I OF-

00:56:36.459 --> 00:56:37.794
MAKE THAT SAME QUESTIONS APART

00:56:37.861 --> 00:56:40.730
FINANCE DO DO YOU HAVE- ANALYSIS

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.499
OR A LIST OF WHAT THAT TO.

00:56:42.565 --> 00:56:44.534
BACKLOG IS OF DEFERRED

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:45.635
MAINTENANCE OF SCHOOL FACILITIES

00:56:45.702 --> 00:56:48.338
. WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC-

00:56:48.404 --> 00:56:49.339
SORRY FOR THAT- CHRIS FERGUSON

00:56:49.405 --> 00:56:50.473
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:52.242
WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC LIST OF

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:53.843
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG

00:56:53.910 --> 00:56:55.178
I THINK AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.913
SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM THERE

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.181

SUGGESTION OR RECOMMENDATION OF

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.363
INCREASING THE AMOUNT THAT GOES

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:15.832
TO FACILITIES AND FOR MINUTES.

00:57:15.899 --> 00:57:17.534
CHOKE FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.803
PROGRAM WE THINK- YOU KNOW THE

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:22.605
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- PUTS FOR

00:57:22.672 --> 00:57:23.907
THREE POINT NINE BILLION A TO

SUPPORT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES

00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:26.309
PROGRAM WE THINK THAT THAT WOULD

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:28.411
ENABLE THE STATE. TO SUSTAIN

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.380
THAT PROGRAM ENDED ITS CURRENT

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.681

CERTAINLY- THE- THE MAY REVISION

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.065
PROPOSES ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.100
TWO. YOU KNOW ASSISTANCE TRICKS

IN IDENTIFYING- YOUR ADDRESSING

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:55.839
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS WOULD

00:57:55.905 --> 00:57:58.908
ALSO NOTE THAT. I AS THE ANALYST

00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:00.777
POINTED OUT- ROUTINE RESTRICTED

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:02.478
MAINTENANCE COUNCIL REQUIREMENTS

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:03.847
HAVE RECENTLY BECOME ACTIVE

00:58:03.913 --> 00:58:05.748
AGAIN- AND THAT REPRESENTS

00:58:05.815 --> 00:58:07.951
ROUGHLY TWO POINT ONE TO TWO

00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.118
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:12.288
ADDITIONAL SPENDING- ON NOT

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.991
MAINTENANCE EACH YEAR. BUT WE

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.292
DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC YOU KNOW

00:58:16.359 --> 00:58:18.027
THOUGHT AS TO YOU SHOULD WE

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.997

WE THINK THE PACKAGE THAT WE PUT

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:25.435
FORWARD IS A- YOU KNOW

00:58:25.501 --> 00:58:26.769
REASONABLE PACKAGE IN THE

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:27.871
TOTALITY OF ALL OF THE

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:29.105
PRIORITIES AND CALLS ON

00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:33.376
AVAILABLE FUNDING- I APPRECIATE

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:36.112
THAT I THINK THE- I THINK THE L.

00:58:36.179 --> 00:58:38.014
A. O. IN AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.016
PALM BEACH DO. DOES MAKE A

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:40.917
COMPELLING CASE AND I THINK THAT

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.852
WITH IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN

00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:44.254
ISSUE WITH THE STATE

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.221
APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT. IT DOES

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:46.990
PROVIDE AN ADDED BENEFIT- AS

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:49.759
WELL SO JUST TO BE CLEAR. WITHIN

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:52.028
THE MAY REVISION. IT'S A TOTAL

00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:54.497
OF THREE POINT NINE BILLION.

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:55.031
SPECIFICALLY FOR DEFERRED

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.900
MAINTENANCE IS THAT CORRECT. BUT

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:59.202
IT'S UP THREE POINT NINE BILLION

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.236
SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT THE

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:01.170
SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM WHICH

00:59:01.237 --> 00:59:02.171
IS MODERNIZATION AND NEW

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.940
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. THERE'S

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:05.341
AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:07.343
BILLION. IN PROPOSITION NINETY

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:09.045
EIGHT THAT IS SET SET ASIDE WORK

00:59:09.112 --> 00:59:10.313
ARE INVESTED IN DEFERRED

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.348
MAINTENANCE SAY IT WOULD BE

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.017
THREE POINT NINE PLUS ONE POINT

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.385
EIGHT. BUDGET SO IT'S SO THE ONE

00:59:15.451 --> 00:59:17.420
POINT IT IS IN ADDITION TO THE

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.055
THREE POINT NINE BUT IN TERMS.

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:20.523
IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS WHAT COMES

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:24.427
OUT OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS IS

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:25.995
THAT IS THAT ONLY THE ONE POINT

00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:27.764
EIGHT. UNDER PROPOSITION EIGHT

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.699
YES ONLY THE ONE TWENTY OKAY- IF

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.769
I COULD QUICKLY GO TO YOU- BUT

00:59:32.835 --> 00:59:34.404
IT LET ME JUST ALSO ASK THIS

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.139
BECAUSE IKNOW THAT THE CHAIR IS

00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:37.540
VERY FOCUSED ON ON TWENTY K.

00:59:37.607 --> 00:59:39.442
EXPANSION WITH. THE THOSE WITH

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:41.277
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FACILITIES-

00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:43.379
MONIES WOULD THEY GO TO THOSE

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:45.515
FACILITIES AS WELL. THAT WOULD

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:47.750
BE GENERALLY A LOCAL DECISION AS

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:49.652
TO HOW TO YOU KNOW DEPLOYED THE

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:51.254
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROCEEDS

00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:52.355
WITHIN THE SCHOOL FACILITIES

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:54.357
PROGRAM HOWEVER. TO THE EXTENT

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.725
THAT THE ADDITIONAL AVERAGE

00:59:55.792 --> 00:59:57.093
DAILY ATTENDANCE GENERATES

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.161
ADDITIONAL ELIGIBILITY WITHIN

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:59.629
THAT PROGRAM CERTAINLY THOSE

00:59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.030
DISTRICTS COULD APPLY TO

01:00:01.097 --> 01:00:01.898
PARTICIPATE THROUGH THAT

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.368
PROGRAM. OKAY AND IN MY- MY LAST

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.537
QUESTION MAYBE THIS IS THE COULD

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:09.739
BE VALUED BY FINANCE- IT CAN

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.074
SOMEONE SHED SOME LIGHT ABOUT

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.176
THE INVEST. IN THE AT THE

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:16.412
STATEWIDE SYSTEM SUPPORT. AND IS

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:17.814
IT POSSIBLE IS THERE A NEED OR

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.015
WHY WE ARGUE THERE'S A NEED TO

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.917
INCREASE INVESTMENT BUT WHAT IS

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.485
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE OF THE

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:26.456
ADMINISTRATION AND- THE NFL AS

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:27.457
ANY. ANALYSIS ON THAT. WE'RE

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.958
GONNA GO OVER THAT AND THAT MORE

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.393
IN THE NEXT SIX SECTION OKAY

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.261
YOUR GESTURE HOLD OFF ON THAT

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:36.866
QUESTION HERE. HOLD OFF ON THE

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:44.340
NEXT DOWNTURN. IN AND INVEST.

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:47.043
YEAH GO AHEAD RESTAURANTS- I

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:48.344
MAKE IT MY QUESTION IS-

01:00:48.411 --> 01:00:52.315
BASICALLY OF TWO- IT'S WHAT IT

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.384
IS FOR MY FIRST WAS FOR THE L.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:58.955
A. O- IS A LOT OF- A LOT OF GOOD

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:00.823
THIS BUDGET I VERY MUCH

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.026
APPRECIATED- BUT I DO I DO HAVE

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.060
A QUESTION WHEN I WHEN I. WHEN

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.095
YOU ADD UP THE MONEY YEAH THAT

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:09.866
ONGOING VERSES ONE TIME- HOW

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:12.268
MUCH. IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.470
BUDGET. HOW MUCH OF THE ONGOING

01:01:14.537 --> 01:01:16.806
MONEY IS BEING USED FOR ONE TIME

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.042
PURPOSES. FOUR AND A HALF

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.243
BILLION WE ARE DEADLINE DOLLARS

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:24.180
WITHIN K. TWELVE EDUCATION SO.

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:25.381
WHEN I TALK ABOUT RAISING THE

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.050
BASE. THAT FOUR AND A ALF

01:01:27.116 --> 01:01:29.652
BILLION DOLLARS. COULD GO TO

01:01:29.719 --> 01:01:31.220
RAISE THE BASE. THAT'S CORRECT

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:32.989
OUR ESTIMATE I THINKWE'VE DONE

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.291
IS THAT FOR EACH ONE PERCENT.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.126
INCREASE IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:40.630
LCF THAT COSTS SOMETHING IN THE

01:01:40.696 --> 01:01:41.764
NEIGHBORHOOD OF SIX HUNDRED AND

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:42.865
SEVENTY MILLION. HOW MUCH WAS

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:45.034
RIGHT SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.202
MILLION PER SEVEN MILLION 31% OF

01:01:46.269 --> 01:01:48.304
THE BASE YEAH. SO THERE'S A

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.038
PRETTY HEAVY INCREASE SITTING

01:01:49.105 --> 01:01:51.741
OUT THERE. IN THAT FOUR POINT

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:53.843
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FROM MY

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.913
PERSPECTIVE. SO I HOPE WITH THE

01:01:56.979 --> 01:02:00.817
BODY. WILL WELL LOOK TO THAT TO

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:02.852
INCREASE THE BASE AND MAY PUT

01:02:02.919 --> 01:02:05.021
THOSE OTHER EXPENDITURES AND

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:08.024
WHAT ARE TRULY ONE TIME MONIES-

01:02:08.091 --> 01:02:12.795
SO THAT I APPRECIATE MISTER.

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:17.567
OKAY I DON'T. IT DES THE DOES

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.469
THE DOES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.138
WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT. THE

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:23.439
VERY FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.574
DOLLARS THIS IS A TREMENDOUS

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.342
AMOUNT OF MONEY AND DRIVING IT

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.579
AWAY. IN SOME CASES FROM THE

01:02:29.645 --> 01:02:31.280
CLASSROOM- WOULD BE RATHER

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:33.182
UNFORTUNATE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.984
SAID DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE AS

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.686
TO WHY YOU WOULD SCORE FOUR

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.554
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.857
FOR ONE TIME USE IS AS OPPOSED

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.892
TO. ONGOING USES. YES CERTAINLY

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.094
A AT A AT THE HIGHEST OF LEVELS

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:45.995
YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:47.196
HEARD FROM THE- ELLIE- DURING

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.798
THE VERY BEGINNING OF THEIR

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.233
PRESENTATION. YOU KNOW WE DO

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.067
ATTEMPT TO BUILD IN SOME LEVEL

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.935
OF ONE TIME RESOURCES OUT OF THE

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.037
ON GOING. AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.406
BALANCE AGAINST INEVITABLE

01:02:57.473 --> 01:03:00.510
DOWNTURNS OR- VARIATIONS IN THE

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.512
STATE ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE- AND

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.614
THAT IS ONE- TOOL THAT WE CAN

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.616
LOOK TOWARD SO. TO THE EXTENT

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:08.951
THAT THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:10.353
POTENTIAL- VARIATION IN THE

01:03:10.419 --> 01:03:11.354
FUTURE YOU KNOW IT WOULD HELP

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.489
MITIGATE- YOU KNOW AGAINST

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:15.291
POTENTIAL CUTS POTENTIAL ACTIONS

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.392
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE

01:03:16.459 --> 01:03:20.129
TO TAKE- OR COULD HAVE TO

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:21.998
CONSIDER- IN A FUTURE BUDGET.

01:03:22.064 --> 01:03:23.833
WELL I GUESS MY RESPONSE TO THAT

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:26.636
WOULD BE. WE HAVE RESERVES OF

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:27.703
THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHICH ARE

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:33.876
HEALTHY. LEVEL AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:36.712
HAVE THOSE RESERVES- IN TIMES.

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.981
AND THOSE ARE NEWER RESERVES

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:40.950
RIGHT FOR THE MOST PART-

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.185
OPPOSITION TO ACCEPT HER PASSED

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:44.220
BY THE VOTERS TO ENSURE THAT WE

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.454
DO HAVE THOSE RESERVES. AND

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:47.557
WE'VE YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD WERE

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:48.224
SO RELUCTANT TO ADEQUATELY FUND

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.193
THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE OF A

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:52.161
DOWNTURN YEAH WE ALREADY HAVE.

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.996
INSURANCE AGAINST THAT DOWNTURN

01:03:54.063 --> 01:03:56.866
AND RESERVES- I DON'T THINK THE

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:59.669
VOTERS WHEN THEY VOTED. FOR

01:03:59.735 --> 01:04:01.871
THOSE RESERVE SIDE WELL. MAYBE

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:03.206
THEY'LL BELIEVE IN SAVE EVEN

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:05.074
MORE BY CREATING THEIR OWN

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.142
RESERVE. BY TAKING ONGOING

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:09.111
MONIES AND PARKING THEM. FOR ONE

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:11.013
TIME USES SO I JUST THINK THAT

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.148
THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S

01:04:12.215 --> 01:04:14.684
A RATHER UNFORTUNATE PERSPECTIVE

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.985
AND I THINK IT SHORTCHANGES THE

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:18.654
CLASSROOM. YEAH BEFORE YOU GET

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.656
TO MISS REYES JUST FOLLOW UP ON

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.525
THAT. YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE BELT

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:24.227
AND SUSPENDERS WITH RECORD

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.728
LEVELS OF SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:27.396
RESERVES AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

01:04:27.463 --> 01:04:29.131
TO DRAW DOWN ON THAT BECAUSE

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.334
THEY PUT SO MUCH IN DURING THE

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.802
PANDEMIC AND COULDN'T SPEND IT

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:34.537
CAN HIRE PEOPLE. AND THEN WE

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.539
HAVE THE PROP NINETY EIGHT

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:37.840
RESERVE SO WE BUILT THE SYSTEMS

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.942
IN PLACE SO WHEN WE GET PROP

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.310
NINETY EIGHT MONEY WE COULD

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:42.878
SPEND IT WE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.380
THAT AN AUSTERITY BUDGET RIGHT

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:46.215
NOW. BECAUSE THE SKY IS FALLING

01:04:46.282 --> 01:04:47.717
THAT. IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. WE

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.518
HAVE THESE TWO THINGS BUILT IN

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.420
SOME. I UNDERSTAND THE

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:53.823
GOVERNOR'S- PRESENTATION THE

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.358
OTHER DAY TALKING ABOUT WHERE

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.393
WE'RE AT WITH. ONE TIME MONEY

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.795
CAPITAL GAINS IN ALICE'S FROM

01:04:59.862 --> 01:05:01.063
TWENTY TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.666
DOT COM CRASH BUT AGAIN THAT'S

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.469
WHY WE PUT IN PLACE. THE SYSTEMS

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:08.170
TO PROTECT US FROM THERE FROM

01:05:08.237 --> 01:05:13.709
THAT AND SO- I THINK AS WELL

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:17.613
HAVE A BIT TOO MUCH IN- ONE TIME

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.115
AND NOT ENOUGH AN ONGOING BASED

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:22.485
UPON- THERE NEEDS SENSE YOU KNOW

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.254
ONE TIME FOR DEFERRED

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:27.056
MAINTENANCE IS ONE THING BUT THE

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.025
ONE TIME WE PUT OUT ALL THESE

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.926
CATEGORICAL THEY ALL SOUND GOOD

01:05:30.993 --> 01:05:32.228
BUT IT'S LITERALLY WHAT WE- GOT

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:33.529
AWAY WITH TEN YEARS AGO. YOU

01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:35.464
KNOW WE WANTED TO GIVE DISTRICTS

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:36.866
FLEXIBILITY AND FOCUS ON ON

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:38.801
THEIR NEEDS AND EVEN MORE SO.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.303
<u>LLOWED THAT WE'LL GET TO THAT A</u>

01:05:40.369 --> 01:05:41.203
SECOND THIS RELAYED THE

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.938
GUARANTEE IN NINETY EIGHT. A LOT

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.473
OF THE ONE TIME CATEGORICAL

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.809
STAFFER FOR THESE IDEAS- WITH

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.144
OTHER COMMUNITY SCHOOLS OR WHAT

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.880
HAVE YOU THAT ARE GOOD IDEAS BUT

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:51.480
YOU HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE. AND

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:53.115
DISTRICTS ARE LEERY ABOUT HOW

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.350
PEOPLE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.619
TIME. AND YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:57.253
ALWAYS FOR THAT BECAUSE THE ONE

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.388
THEY WANT A FULL TIME JOB SO- I

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.023
JUST THINK WE- LEARN THIS

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.159
LESSON. AND THE MAX AMOUNT WE

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:05.127
CAN GIVE. TO DISTRICTS WITH

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:07.596
MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY- IS THE

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:10.366
PREFERRED OPTION. SO ASSEMBLY

01:06:10.433 --> 01:06:13.436
MEMBER RACE. FORGET MY QUESTION

01:06:13.502 --> 01:06:16.138
I THINK THAT. THE BILL THE STAFF

01:06:16.205 --> 01:06:18.908
WANTS FULL TIME. WORK BUT THEY

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:20.609
ALSO WON'T BE PAID PROPERLY. AND

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.178
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:23.612
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:25.681
REMIND OURSELVES OF THAT WE'RE

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.718
EXPECTING PEOPLE TO WORK. TO WE

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:31.053
GIVE THEM FUNDING FOR JUST. ONE

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.756
TIME. THEY WANT TO HIRE THE BEST

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:34.323
BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.926
CAN'T KEEP THEM OF THE CAN'T PAY

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:38.027
THEM PROPERLY. BUT MY QUESTION

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:40.763
HAS TO DO WITH THE DEFERRED

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.598
MAINTENANCE IN THE ALLEY- REPORT

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.234
. ARE YOU SAY THAT THEY PROPOSE

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:46.602
ONE EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:47.636
BILLION. FOR DEFERRED

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.739
MAINTENANCE. SHOULD BE HIGHER

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:53.642
AND YOU SAID THAT THE BACKLOG.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:56.579
IS LIKELY LARGER THAN THE ONE

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:59.315
POINT EIGHT BILLION. MY QUESTION

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.083
IS HOW DO WE DETERMINE HOW MUCH

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.552
LARGER THAT IS AND WHY AREN'T WE

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:06.088
ACCOUNTING FOR IT. YES SO ONE OF

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.857
THE WAYS WE'VE TRYING TO ANSWER

01:07:07.923 --> 01:07:10.693
THAT IS TO LOOK AT WELL WHAT WAS

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.327
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. WHAT

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:13.129
DISTRICTS WOULD CONTRIBUTE UNDER

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.830
THE HISTORICAL STANDARD WHICH IS

01:07:14.897 --> 01:07:16.599
YOU SET ASIDE 3% OF YOUR BUDGET

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.300
FOR MAINTENANCE AND WHAT THE

01:07:18.367 --> 01:07:20.136
STATE. ALLOWED THEM TO

01:07:20.202 --> 01:07:21.837
CONTRIBUTE ABOUT THE PAST TEN

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:24.106
YEARS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.274
LOWER- I THINK MY ONE OF MY

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:26.041
COLLEAGUES ARE STILL KIND OF

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:28.144
LOOKING INTO THAT. BUT IT SEEMS

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:29.445
TO BE GOING AT FIRST GLANCE IT

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:31.180
THAT'S A BIT LARGER THAT'S MORE

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.015
THAN ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION- IN

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.049
TERMS OF MONEY THAT. ORDINARILY

01:07:34.116 --> 01:07:35.217
WOULD HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR

01:07:35.284 --> 01:07:36.886
MAINTENANCE BUT- WASN'T BECAUSE

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:38.053
OF THE FISCAL RELIEF THE

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.022
LEGISLATURE. TO PROVIDE. DURING

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.992
THE GREAT RECESSION YEARS. YEAH

01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:44.627
MMHM MY NEXT QUESTION I KNOW I'M

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:46.529
NOT GOING TO PHRASE IT AS

01:07:46.595 --> 01:07:49.064
ELOQUENTLY AS I SHOULD. BUT I'VE

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.966
HI RIGHT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:55.671
MANY OF OUR- POOR SCHOOLS. DON'T

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.641
REPORT WHAT IT IS THEY NEED TO

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:00.176
TAKE CARE OF THEIR FACILITIES

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.077
ARE SO USED TO MAKING DO WITH

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:05.347
WHAT THEY HAVE. AND THE

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:07.583
FACILITIES THAT ARE MUCH BETTER

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:08.651
. THE MOMENT SOMETHING GOES

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.519
WRONG THEY'RE ABLE TO TELL YOU

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.688
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS THEY NEED TO

01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:14.857
BRING IT UP TO THE LEVEL THEY

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.592
HAD TO THAT. IS THERE SOMETHING

01:08:16.659 --> 01:08:19.094
THAT WE CAN- THAT WE SHOULD DO

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:21.130
TO MAKE SURE THAT. THOSE

01:08:21.197 --> 01:08:23.365
COMMUNITIES THOSE FACILITIES ALL

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:26.769
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT MOST NEED

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.472
IT THEN GET TO THE TECHNICAL

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:30.272
ASSISTANCE OR WHATEVER

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:32.508
ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO PROPERLY

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:35.845
PRESENT WHAT THEY REALLY NEED TO

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:37.780
BRING THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.248
AND BRING THE FACILITIES UP TO

01:08:39.315 --> 01:08:41.684
WHERE THEY SHOULD BE. I THANK

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.085
YOU FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IN

01:08:43.152 --> 01:08:45.120
THE NEXT PANEL ONE OF MY

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.655
COLLEAGUES MIGHT HAVE SOME MORE

01:08:46.722 --> 01:08:47.656
COMMENTS BUT- THIS IS OFTEN A

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:49.091
FRUSTRATION THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.360
THAT WE DON'T HAVE A- STATE WIDE

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:53.496
INVENTORY OF THE NEEDS AND KIND

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:54.296
OF FACILITY CONDITION OF

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.499
DISTRICTS. THAT SOMETHING- THE

01:08:56.565 --> 01:08:57.867
STATE COULD THINK ABOUT-

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:58.934
POTENTIALLY ASKING DISTRICTS

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.170
REPORT MAYBE AS A CONDITION OF

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.639
RECEIVING THIS FUNDING- YEAH WE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:06.642
DON'T HAVE A- LIKE A- SPECIFIC.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.277
RECOMMENDATION AT THIS POINT BUT

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.879
IT IS SOMETHING WE'RE THINKING

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.280
ABOUT- AND THAT POTENTIALLY

01:09:11.347 --> 01:09:14.483
COULD START TO ADDRESS THAT KIND

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:15.651
OF INFORMATION GAP THAT WE HAVE

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:19.522

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.491
EQUITY LINES THAT THAT YOU-

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:25.160
NOTED MEMBER- I WOULD NOTE THAT-

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:27.029

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.236
COUNTS- TO JUST ALLOCATE THOSE

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.605
RESOURCES TO DISTRICTS. SO

01:09:36.672 --> 01:09:38.073
THROUGH THE ALLOCATION METHOD OF

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.675
THAT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:40.609
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.177

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:53.422
MISTER CHAIR I KNOW THAT THAT IS

01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.424
WHAT WE SHOULD DO BUT TO RIGHT

01:09:55.491 --> 01:09:57.393
WHEN WE LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:59.662
INEQUITY LANCE WINDOW. EQUITY

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:00.963
DOES NOT EXIST OFTENTIMES

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:04.800
BECAUSE- THOSE SCHOOLS THAT NEED

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:07.403
IT THE MOST. ARE NOT THE MOST

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:11.073
VOCAL- AND THEY DON'T GET THEIR

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.842
EQUITABLE SHARE OF. THAT WHAT IS

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:16.245
NEEDED BY THEM AND WHAT TO IT

01:10:16.312 --> 01:10:18.213
THAT THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.456
OF THE FUNDING IT'S STILL AN

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.658
ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.061
COMMENTS BUT I THINK HAVING A

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.797
STATE WIDE INVENTORY. I THINK

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:37.866
WOULD BE A GOOD BEGINNING AND IT

01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:40.302
TOO TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING THAT

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.304

DISTRICTS PROVIDE THE

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.809
INFORMATION THAT IS NEEDED- SO

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.310
THAT WHEN WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:49.612
ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ARE

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:51.780

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.082
THAT FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:56.518
BEHIND. ONLY BECAUSE THEY- MAYBE

01:10:56.585 --> 01:10:57.353
THEY DON'T FEEL THAT THEY

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.054
DESERVE IT OR THEY FEEL THAT

01:10:59.121 --> 01:11:00.789
THEY'VE BEEN USED TO DOING WHAT

01:11:00.856 --> 01:11:03.292
THEY DID WITH SO LITTLE. THAT

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.694
THEY'LL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND-

01:11:05.761 --> 01:11:08.030
WHAT WE NEED TO DO MORE TO

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:11.433
PROVIDE. A MORE EQUITABLE SHARE

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.535

PROGRAMS HAVE FACED OVER THE

01:16:32.521 --> 01:16:34.489
PAST SEVERAL YEARS- WE DO THINK

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:36.758
OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.193

WOULD RECOMMEND ARE REJECTING-

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:41.797
THE ELEMENT OF THE PROPOSAL

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.899
THAT'S TO REALLOCATE ANY UNUSED

UNSPENT FUNDS WITHIN CAN BE MADE

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:49.838
IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND

01:16:49.905 --> 01:16:51.273
THERE'S ALREADY FOUR HUNDRED

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:01.183
GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL WOULD ACT-

01:17:01.249 --> 01:17:02.417

HIGHER YOU UCBCP DISTRICTS ARE

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:48.163
ARE NOT GETTING MORE MONEY BUT

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:52.834
HAVE HIGHER REQUIREMENTS- IN THE

EXTRA LEARNING IN. PROGRAM

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:57.773
THERE'S AN AUGMENTATION IN THE

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.441
MIRROR VISION WE CONTINUE TO.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:00.242
RECOMMEND THAT YOU REJECT THE

ENTIRE AMOUNT. THERE WILL BE

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.112

EXPANDED LEARNING FUNDING IN THE

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:06.882

THAT. DISTRICTS WILL WILL TAKE

01:18:09.551 --> 01:18:11.019

COMING BUDGET YEAR SO WE THINK

01:18:15.424 --> 01:18:17.459
ANY UNSPENT FUNDS OF THOSE COULD

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.461
BE USED. TO COVER THOSE COSTS.

01:18:19.528 --> 01:18:20.395
I'M ON THE PROFESSIONAL

WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANTS WE

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:26.468
RECOMMEND REJECTING ALL OF

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:29.271
THOSE- THERE WERE THE TWENTY ONE

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.939
TWENTY TWO BUDGET INCLUDE ONE

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:31.873
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN.

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.841
PROFESSIONAL DAHLE DEVELOPMENT

01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:34.342
FUNDING THROUGH THE EDUCATOR

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:36.178
EFFECTIVENESS BLOCK GRANT- THE

OF THE OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.251
ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WAS CRIED

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:44.953
DURING THE PANDEMIC CAN BE USED

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.088
FOR SO I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:48.090
DEVELOPMENT AS WELL- THE WITH A

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:48.890
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:50.125
AVAILABLE WE DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:52.494
AN I NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:53.395
SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THIS

01:18:53.462 --> 01:18:54.996
PURPOSE. I'M AND THEN FINALLY ON

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:55.997
ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AN ISSUE

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.499
THAT WAS. DISCUSSED EARLIER I

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.501
THINK I WOULD ADD A LITTLE. MORE

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.136
CONTACT ON THE ON HOW WE GOT TO

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:02.904
THE BACKLOG- I'M THIRTY WE'RE

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.506
STILL LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.308
DATA MOVING BACK BUT AND- IT BY

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:09.544
LOOKING AT THE FEW YEARS THAT WE

01:19:09.611 --> 01:19:11.813
HAVE- WHEN WE HAVE THESE. LOWER

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.881
REQUIREMENTS. IF YOU LOOK TO US

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.049
LIKE IT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED

01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:15.917
MILLION DOLLARS IN LESS SPENDING

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:18.820
THE DISTRICTS HAD ON- ON ON

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.590
MAINTENANCE DURING THE PERIOD WE

01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:22.190
PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY. THE

01:19:22.257 --> 01:19:22.891
FLEXIBILITY WITHIN PLACE FOR

01:19:22.958 --> 01:19:25.193
ROUGHLY TEN YEARS SO WE THINK

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.728
THAT. IT'S VERY. WELL COULD BE

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.864
THAT IT'S IN THE MIDDLE MORE IF

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.832
MORE THAN TWO BILLION DOLLARS-

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:32.200
TO GET THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:34.336
AT THE EXACT NUMBERS AND WE CAN.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.304
SHARE MORE OF YOUR MONEY TO SO

01:19:36.371 --> 01:19:37.172
THAT'S- PART OF OUR

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:38.273
RECOMMENDATION FOR. WHY WE SAY

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:39.641
YOU CAN DO MORE- TO ADDRESS

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.577
THAT. HIGHER HIGHER BACKLOG.

01:19:42.644 --> 01:19:44.446
RIGHT ONE OTHER THING I'LL POINT

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:45.480
OUT THAT THE WITH. DIFFERENT

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:47.382
FUNDING WOULD GO OUT IN EITHER

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.384
OF THE CASES IT'S BASED ON. THE

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.152
DISTRICTS SAYING THESE ARE NEED

01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:52.354
SORRY WHAT IT WOULDN'T CREATE-

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.789
WOULDN'T CREATE THIS- SYSTEM

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.258
WHERE. DEPENDING ON HOW THEY

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.526
CLASSIFY THESE COSTS. THEY WOULD

01:19:57.592 --> 01:19:59.261
BE REWARDED OR PENALIZED AS A

01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:01.129
RESULT SO- BUT WE WOULD POINT

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.731
OUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:05.500
PROPOSAL IS TO USE- THE NUMBER

01:20:05.567 --> 01:20:06.868
OF. THE T. ELLER LOW INCOME

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.303
STUDENTS AND DISTRICT TO DECIDE

01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.905
HOW TO ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS. WE

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.373
WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND USING A

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.908
DIFFERENT APPROACH USING LIKE

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:20.115
THE TAXABLE. VALUE OF A STRICT.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:22.350
IN PROVIDED AMHERST UNTIL MORE

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:23.852
BOB TAX VALUE IN DISTRICT. I WAS

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.020
THOSE. GIVE MORE FUNDING THAN

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.154
THOSE WITH HARPER TAX BUT

01:20:26.221 --> 01:20:28.423
BECAUSE OF. FROM WHY ISN'T THAT

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:29.024
THE MORE DIRECT. RELATIONSHIP

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.125
WITH. A DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.359
NEEDS IF. OFTENTIMES THERE ARE

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.127
DISTRICTS HAVE LOWER. PROP VALUE

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:33.628
ARE THAT ARE. MORE CONSTRAINED

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.963
IN THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.831
BOND REVENUE AND THEN HAVE.

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:40.001
HIGHER I MEAN IT'S POSSIBLE TO

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.369
FACILITIES. I'M WORKING WITH MY

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:41.970

BACK TO MR FONG IN A SPECIFIC

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:57.619

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:48.997
PROVIDES SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE

01:22:49.064 --> 01:22:51.166
THROUGH THAT SYSTEM. SO IT IS A

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.167
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BUT THE

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:53.368
DIFFERENCE IS THE SYSTEMS PEOPLE

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.570
ROUGHLY SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TO

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:56.705
SEVENTY SO CERTAINLY A I'M SURE

01:22:56.771 --> 01:22:58.506
YOU'VE HEARD THAT THE PANDEMIC

01:22:58.573 --> 01:22:59.474
HAS HAS CREATED SIGNIFICANT

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:01.409
ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

01:23:01.476 --> 01:23:03.211
CHALLENGES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:06.114
AND NOW IT'S A CAN OF A YEAR

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.582
ROUND CHALLENGE- IT HISTORICALLY

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:10.385
I MEAN. I GUESS THE LAST FIVE

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:13.588
YEARS HAS THAT BINDING GONE. OR

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.056
BEEN PRETTY. WHAT THE WHAT IS

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.124
THE TREND. THAT THE FORMULA FOR

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.392
DIFFERENT INSISTENCE IS CALLED

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.960
OUT AND STATUTES SO IT'S BASED

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:21.529
ON A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE-

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:23.565
AND IT'S BASED ON TO BE- THAT

01:23:23.631 --> 01:23:25.633
NUMBER OF A LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.634
AGENCIES THAT ARE IDENTIFIED

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.603
THROUGH THE DASHBOARD. BECAUSE

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.772
THE DASHBOARD HAS BEEN-

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.374
OFFICIALLY OFFICIALLY PAUSE

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.975
BECAUSE OF- ASSESSMENTS NOT

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:35.844
OCCURRING DURING THE PANDEMIC.

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.479
IT HAS BEEN FLAT THESE LAST

01:23:37.545 --> 01:23:38.380
COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE WE

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:40.548
HAVEN'T SEEN THE NUMBER OF LOCAL

01:23:40.615 --> 01:23:42.317
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:43.685
FLUCTUATING BECAUSE OF THE

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.453
DASHBOARD RESULTS- FOR MANY

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:47.789
FLAT. BUT IN IN THE FUTURE AS-

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.557
AS MORE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:50.892
AGENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED. THERE

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:54.896
COULD BE FLUCTUATIONS- DEPENDING

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:55.864
ON THOSE DASHBOARD RESULTS. DO

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:59.100
YOU ANTICIPATE A ADDED DO YOU

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:01.369
ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL

01:24:01.436 --> 01:24:03.505
INVESTMENTS IN IN THE SPACE THAT

01:24:03.571 --> 01:24:05.507
WE DO- WE DO TRUE UP THE FORMULA

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.242
EVERY YEAR AGAIN IT S BASED ON

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:08.476
THAT THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE

01:24:08.543 --> 01:24:11.513
SO YOU KNOW ASK THE DASHBOARD-

01:24:11.579 --> 01:24:13.715
RESULTS OF PRINT OFFICIALLY

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:15.283
BECOME ON PASTA I'M COMING OFF

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.252
OF THE PANDEMIC WE WILL SEE THAT

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.353
FLUCTUATIONS IN AGAIN THE

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.954
FORMULA WILL TAKE THAT INTO

01:24:20.021 --> 01:24:21.322
ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON A

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:22.991
ROLLING AVERAGE SO THERE THERE

01:24:23.057 --> 01:24:24.559
WILL BE I AM NATURAL

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:25.627
FLUCTUATIONS THROUGH THAT

01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:27.629
PROCESS. OKAY BUT THERE'S NO

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.664
THERE'S NO THE YOU CAN INFUSE

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:32.267
ADDITIONAL ONE TIME MONIES INTO

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:34.068
THIS OR OR WOULD YOU OR CAN YOU

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.970
SAID THAT THE STATUTE- IN TERMS

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:38.573
OF THE FOR THE FORMULA IS EFFECT

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.808
OBVIOUSLY NOTHING WOULD PROHIBIT

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.643
AN ADJUSTMENT- BEING MADE

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:43.912
OUTSIDE OF THE FORMULA- SIMILAR

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.480
TO WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR- FOR

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.381
LIKE THE CHARTER DIFFERENT

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.849
ADDRESSES AND FAT IS OUTSIDE OF

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.617
THE FORMULA- AT THIS POINT

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:51.052
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW MANY ARE

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:53.221
IDENTIFIED I'M RECOGNIZING THAT

01:24:53.288 --> 01:24:54.222
IN THE FUTURE IT WILL BECOME

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:58.493
PART OF THAT. DEBT FREE A

01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.461
ROLLING AVERAGE GOING FORWARD.

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:00.295
OKAY BUT WE SHOULD INFORMATION

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:06.935
THEY GIVE A MUCH. K. QUESTION.

01:25:07.001 --> 01:25:09.404
I'LL BE A FEW QUESTIONS TWO

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:10.271
WEEKS AGO WE HAD THE BIG

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.907
DISCUSSION ON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:16.144
AND WHAT'S THE REASON RATIONALE

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.646
FOR PUTTING THEM INCREASE RIGHT

01:25:18.713 --> 01:25:19.414
HERE WE'RE JUST KIND OF ROLLING

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:21.683
IT OUT. I KNOW WE HAVE MONEY TO

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:25.119
SPEND AND TO FINANCE DELEO SAYS

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:27.388
THEY WILL. THAT PRESUMABLY FOLK

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.390
BETTER FOCUS HAVE ONE TIME THEN

01:25:29.457 --> 01:25:31.993
I'M GOING. TO THE BASE ITSELF WE

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.761
HAVE A SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT THERE

01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:35.129
BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS FOR

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:38.466
COMMITTEE SCHOOLS. ALL FINISHERS

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:39.501
HANG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.736
FINANCE THE ONE POINT FIVE

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.071
BILLION IS BASED OFF OF THE

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:45.006
NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM THE

01:25:45.073 --> 01:25:46.140
FIRST ROUND OF PLANNING AND

01:25:46.207 --> 01:25:47.809
IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS WE

01:25:47.876 --> 01:25:50.311
THOUGHT. AND HIGH DEMAND FOR THE

01:25:50.378 --> 01:25:51.779
IT THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL GRANTS

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:53.081
AND WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING IT

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:54.649
THERE TO BE AN INCREASE IN

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:55.884
INTEREST AND APPLICATIONS FOR

01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:57.051
THE FUTURE AROUND THE PLANNING

01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.653
IMPLEMENTATION GRANT SO GIVEN

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.723
THESE ASSUMPTIONS WE AND- ASSUME

01:26:01.789 --> 01:26:03.591
THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT

01:26:03.658 --> 01:26:05.994
FIVE BILLION IS NEEDED. AND ARE

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.929
CONTENT TO WITH THIS ADDITIONAL

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.564
FUNDING IS TO EXPAND THE ACCESS

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:10.698
TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANTS

01:26:10.765 --> 01:26:13.034
TO EVERY ELIGIBLE ALLOCATE THAT

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:16.604
WISHES TO APPLY. HELLO YES- THIS

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:18.940
IS ONE THAT WE- WE DO WE DO

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.842
THINK THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT SOME

01:26:20.909 --> 01:26:22.277
OF THEIR THE ESTIMATE THAT

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.212
FINANCING IN TERMS OF OUR THAT

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:26.414
THE DEPARTMENT OF ED. PUT

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.482
TOGETHER IN TERMS OF THE

01:26:27.549 --> 01:26:28.283
AFTERMATH. WE DO THINK IT'S

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:29.884
REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THAT

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:31.519
THERE MIGHT BE SOME OF THE IF

01:26:31.586 --> 01:26:33.788
YOU WANT TO FIND ALL INTERESTED-

01:26:33.855 --> 01:26:35.189
SCHOOLS YOU MIGHT NEED TO

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.324
PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE

01:26:36.391 --> 01:26:37.559
DON'T KNOW THAT THE ONE POINT

01:26:37.625 --> 01:26:38.927
FIVE BILLION AS OF DECEMBER WE

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.094
DO SOME AUGMENTATIONS HERE.

01:26:40.161 --> 01:26:42.263
COULD BE- COULD BE REASONABLE TO

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:45.366
ADD- I THINK WE WERE NOT THOUGH

01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:46.334
THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE

01:26:46.401 --> 01:26:48.136
THAT AMOUNT AND FUNDING FOR

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:49.804
OTHER PRIORITIES. I THINK BASED

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:53.374
ON THE ANTICIPATED GRANT CYCLES

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:54.642
WE DO THINK THAT IF THERE WAS

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.210
SOME. ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT

01:26:56.277 --> 01:26:57.445
YOU NEED IT WOULD NECESSARY NEED

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.581
TO BE IN THE BUDGET YEAR SO YOU

01:26:59.647 --> 01:27:01.382
CAN REVISIT THIS NEXT YEAR AS

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:02.517
WELL IF THEIR WORK IF IT'S

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.886
SOMETHING THAT YOU. WANTED TO-

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:06.955
TO LOOK AT NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:07.989
HAVE BETTER INFORMATION ON THE

01:27:08.056 --> 01:27:09.390
NEXT ROUND OF ABOUT THE

01:27:09.457 --> 01:27:10.358
CONSTRUCTION WAS ONE WORD. IF

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:12.527
THERE WAS INTEREST IN IN IN IN

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:13.328
MAKING SURE THERE WAS PLENTY

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:15.229
AVAILABLE WE DO THINK. THE

01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:19.901
pREASONABLE BUT- IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:27:19.968 --> 01:27:21.035
THE RIGHT AMOUNT THERE'S A LOT

01:27:21.102 --> 01:27:23.571
OF. A LOT OF A- GIVEN THAT GIVEN

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:24.772
THAT WE'RE STILL EARLY ON IN THE

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:27.942
IN THE GRANT PROCESS. AND THEN-

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:30.144
AS FAR AS THE THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.379
FOR THE HOLDING HARMLESS FOR THE

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.482
ADDITIONAL YEAR. YEAH THIS IS

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:36.517
BASED UPON THE PREMISE THAT

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:38.820
THERE WAS ONE TIME IMPACT HERE

01:27:38.886 --> 01:27:40.622
FOR THE PANDEMIC AND NOT TO BE

01:27:40.688 --> 01:27:43.024
CONFUSED WITH THE OVERALL.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.526
DECLINING ENROLLMENT- IN

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:48.463
GENERAL. AND SO THERE WAS ANY

01:27:48.529 --> 01:27:50.298
FUSION OF FEDERAL MONEY FOR THAT

01:27:50.365 --> 01:27:53.735
SO. WHAT WHY WHY THEY NEEDED TO

01:27:53.801 --> 01:27:55.603
GO BACK AND JUSTICE BY CAN'T WE

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.106
JUST USE THE PERMITTED.

01:27:58.172 --> 01:28:00.842
BASICALLY SOFTEN OUT. THE IMPACT

01:28:00.908 --> 01:28:04.045
FOR THE ONE TIME DROP.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.413
RETURNABLE FOR THE FOR THE

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:08.149
HEALTHY OF ATTENDANCE THE- YEAH

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:11.052
I- YEAH I THINK I THINK THE SO

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:12.487
THE DISTRICTS RECEIVE THE

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.855
ASSISTANCE OF THE FEDERAL

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.056
FUNDING THAT THEY COULD USE FOR

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.725
A READY FOR THIS IS IT THAT IS

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:18.860
ALLOCATED BASED ON THE TITLE ONE

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:19.794
FORMULA THAT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:20.995
THAN. THE ADDRESSING DECLINES IN

01:28:21.062 --> 01:28:23.364
ATTENDANCE I THINK THE WAY WE DO

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.199
NOT CONSIDER THAT WE THOUGHT

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:25.833
THAT DEMONSTRATION PROPOSAL WAS

01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.803
REASONABLE WITH REGARDS TO ALFIE

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.604
AFFECTED THAT SUCH A THING.

01:28:29.671 --> 01:28:31.272
WE'RE GOING TO FIND YOU BASED

01:28:31.339 --> 01:28:32.440
ON. HOW MANY KIDS ARE ENROLLED

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.308
IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT

01:28:34.375 --> 01:28:35.143
WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME THAT

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:36.511
THEY'RE ATTENDING AT THE RATE

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:38.312
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIOR TO THE

01:28:38.379 --> 01:28:40.081
PANDEMIC THAT SEEM TO US. TO BE

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.282
A REASONABLE WAY TO. PROVIDE

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:42.550
SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IN A

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:43.785
WAY THAT'S- FILL THE STILL

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.520
YOU'RE CONNECTED TO STUDENTS. TO

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:47.155
NUMBER THIRTY THREE BY.

01:28:47.221 --> 01:28:48.056
RECOGNIZING THAT THE ATTENDANCE

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:49.524
THIS YEAR IS JUST. YOU KNOW

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:51.426
HISTORICALLY LOW IS DOWN. 8%

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:54.262
STATEWIDE- IN THE INITIAL-

01:28:54.328 --> 01:28:55.830
ATTENDANCE ESTIMATES. NUTS

01:28:55.897 --> 01:28:58.499
BEFORE ON THE GROUND- AND WITH

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:00.034
SO WE THINK THAT. YOU KNOW. WE

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.536
KNOW THAT THESE THESE CHANGES IN

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:02.770
ATTENDANCE IN THIS YEAR ARE

01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:06.040
REALLY. REALLY DUE TO FACTORS

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:08.076
OUTSIDE OF DISTRICTS CONTROL.

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:09.644
THE FINANCE WHAT TO ADDRESS THAT

01:29:09.711 --> 01:29:11.713
IS ACTUALLY WHY THEY NEED TO

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:14.615
PUT. ADDITIONAL MONEY IN HERE

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:16.317
VERSUS. ALLOWING THE SCHOOL

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.853
DISTRICTS TO USE THAT ONE TIME

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.454
FEDERAL MONEY. TO SOFTEN THE

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:30.431
BLOW.

01:29:30.498 --> 01:29:32.066
SO IF I MAY UM CHRIS FERGUSON

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:33.768
WITH FINANCE AGAIN I THINK

01:29:33.835 --> 01:29:34.836
THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO

01:29:34.902 --> 01:29:36.137
DECLINING ENROLLMENT THERE'S A

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.338
ONE TIME COMPONENT THAT WE'RE

01:29:37.405 --> 01:29:39.440
LOOKING OUT FOR- CHARTER SCHOOLS

01:29:39.507 --> 01:29:40.675
THAT HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY HAD

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:45.012
THAT- CAPABILITY A OR THAT YOU

01:29:45.079 --> 01:29:47.448
KNOW- ACCESS TO THAT TYPE OF

01:29:47.515 --> 01:29:48.983
ADJUSTMENT AND THEN IN THE

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.518
ONGOING BASIS. WE'RE REALLY JUST

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:51.619
TRYING TO ATTEMPT TO SMOOTH OUT

01:29:51.686 --> 01:29:53.154
DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:55.389
DISTRICTS SO BY APPLYING- THE

01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:57.692
ABA STANDARD THAT WE HAVE-

01:29:57.759 --> 01:29:59.927
YOU'RE SMOOTHING OUT THE STATE

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:01.195
FUNDING FOR THOSE DISTRICTS OVER

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.997
TIME- WITHOUT THAT YOU WOULD SEE

01:30:03.064 --> 01:30:04.866
A NATURAL DECLINE IN L. C. F. F.

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:07.268
FUNDING- COULD SOME DISTRICTS

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:09.137
HAVE ACCESS TO FEDERAL RESOURCES

01:30:09.203 --> 01:30:10.638
TO ADDRESS THAT. YEAH AND IT

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:11.973
IT'S LIKELY THAT THERE MAY BE A

01:30:12.039 --> 01:30:13.241
HANDFUL DISTRICTS OUT THERE THAT

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:15.510
DO HAVE- FEDERAL RESOURCES THAT

01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.111
WERE UP PROVIDED DIRECTLY TO

01:30:17.178 --> 01:30:18.279
THEM. THERE WILL BE OTHER

01:30:18.346 --> 01:30:19.914
DISTRICTS HOWEVER BECAUSE THE

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.783
FEDERAL FORMULA FOR THE PRIMARY

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.351
ALLOCATION MR FUNDING RELIED

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:25.186
UPON TITLE ONE COUNTS. THERE ARE

01:30:25.253 --> 01:30:26.287
OTHER DISTRICTS THAT DID NOT

01:30:26.354 --> 01:30:27.922
HAVE A HIGH TITLE ONE COUNTS

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:29.624
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE- SIGNIFICANT

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.225
RESOURCE FEDERAL RESOURCES

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.360
AVAILABLE TO THEM TO TRY AND

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:33.995
MITIGATE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:38.633
LIKE A DECLINE IN- ATTENDANCE.

01:30:38.699 --> 01:30:40.434
OKAY AND THEN LASTLY ON THIS

01:30:40.501 --> 01:30:42.203
PROPOSAL THIS IS FOR FINANCE FOR

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.239
THIS MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

01:30:45.306 --> 01:30:48.976
AND HOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY-

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:51.145
RECONCILE WITH THE ACTUAL. MEAL

01:30:51.212 --> 01:30:56.217
COSTS. YOU'RE LISTENING WITH THE

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.852
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.520
CURRENTLY SCHOOLS ARE RECEIVING

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:01.722
IN THE HANDS RATES AND ALSO ABLE

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.691
TO SERVE MEALS TO ALL STUDENTS

01:31:03.758 --> 01:31:04.992
WITHOUT COLLECTING ELIGIBILITY

01:31:05.059 --> 01:31:07.862
INFORMATION SO THESE TWO WAIVERS

01:31:07.929 --> 01:31:09.230
ARE EXPECTED TO EXPIRE AT THE

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:10.865
END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR JUNE

01:31:10.932 --> 01:31:13.334
THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE

01:31:13.401 --> 01:31:15.603
ARE PROPOSING TO BASICALLY BACK

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.171
FILLED THAT THOSE FEDERAL

01:31:17.238 --> 01:31:19.740
FINANCED RATES- BY INCREASING

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:20.942
THE BASE FOR THE STATE MEAL

01:31:21.008 --> 01:31:22.543
PROGRAM SO SCHOOLS CONTINUE TO

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:24.245
RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL AS THEY

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.479
ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING IN THE

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:26.914
CURRENT YEAR WE GET THAT BUT

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:29.851
DOES THAT ACTUALLY JIVE WITH THE

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:31.352
TRUE COSTS. OF WHAT THEY ARE. IT

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:32.987
IS IT WARRANTED FOR THIS

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.622
INCREASE I'M OF COURSE WE LOVE

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:35.957
SCHOOL MEALS WE DID LAST YEAR

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:40.228
UNIVERSAL OVER FOR THAT. BUT-

01:31:40.294 --> 01:31:41.329
MAYBE IT'S FAR QUESTION FOR L.

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:43.197
A. R. D. IF YOU THINK THAT THIS

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:44.465
WARRANTS THIS INCREASE VERSUS

01:31:44.532 --> 01:31:46.267
THE ACTUAL TRUE COSTS I DON'T

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:47.969
THINK WE CAN SPECIFY YOU HAVE A

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:50.104
DIFF IT HAVE TO BE JUST ABOUT WE

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:52.106
DO THINK YOU'RE EVEN BEFORE THE

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.140
YEAR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THERE

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.942
WAS A PROPOSAL IN. JANUARY

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.210
BUDGET TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE

01:31:56.277 --> 01:31:57.945
MODEST ARE INCREASED TO THE

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.947
STATE RATE INSIDE THAT TIME WE

01:32:00.014 --> 01:32:01.148
DID LOOK INTO A LITTLE BIT OF.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.050
THE PROGRAMAND AT THAT TIME

01:32:03.117 --> 01:32:04.785
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THERE HAVE

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:05.887
BEEN SOME PRESSURES IN THE

01:32:05.953 --> 01:32:07.288
NUTRITION PROGRAM BECAUSE AS LCF

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:08.890
IS GROWING SUBSTANTIALLY. AND

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:10.358
STAFF SALARIES WERE GROWING THE

01:32:10.424 --> 01:32:11.592
PROGRAM ITSELF WAS ONLY GETTING

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:14.128
COLD SO AT THAT TIME WE THOUGHT

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:16.063
MAYBE IT WAS REASONABLE TO ADD A

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:17.531
TO PROVIDE A RATE INCREASE.

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.300
SINCE THEN WE ALSO NOW HAVE- YOU

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.435
KNOW. SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT

01:32:21.502 --> 01:32:23.104
INFLATION WITH REGARDS TO FOOD

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:25.172
PRICES SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON

01:32:25.239 --> 01:32:26.908
TO THINK THAT THAT THAT THE

01:32:26.974 --> 01:32:29.377
EXISTING RATES MAYBE- THAT WE

01:32:29.443 --> 01:32:31.012
COULD INCREASE THE STATE RATE

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:33.047
THAT TO HELP PROVIDE OF. THESE

01:32:33.114 --> 01:32:33.981
COST PRESSURES NOW CAN WE SAY

01:32:34.048 --> 01:32:36.050
THAT THE SIXTY SENSE OF THE

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:37.051
RIGHT AMOUNT THAT I THINK IS

01:32:37.118 --> 01:32:38.052
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:32:38.119 --> 01:32:39.120
INFORMATION TO TELL YOU THAT

01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:41.756
THAT'S THE CASE AND THROW UP AND

01:32:41.822 --> 01:32:43.090
PER OR THAT WE DO THINK FROM

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:43.958
AUGMENTATION IS REASONABLE BUT-

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.526
WE THINK OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:47.495
PRIORITIES TO. USE THAT FOR

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:48.596
OTHER ONGOING BECAUSE WE THINK

01:32:48.663 --> 01:32:52.466
THAT THAT COULD. MAKE SENSIBLE.

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:54.769
OKAY QUESTION FROM COMMITTEE.

01:32:54.835 --> 01:33:00.942

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:47.488
A THREE YEAR SO TWO MILLION PER

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.123
YEAR FOR THREE YEARS TO SUPPORT

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.992
THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS-

01:33:51.058 --> 01:33:52.960

PRESSURES THAT THEY'RE FACING-

01:33:59.266 --> 01:34:00.668
IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL BUDGET

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.004
WOULD ALSO HELP THEM- SUPPORT

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:04.038
YOU KNOW SCHOLARSHIPS AND OTHER

ATTEND THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE

01:34:07.608 --> 01:34:10.244
ARTS OVER THE SUMMER- I BELIEVE

01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:12.246
THE- TUITION- IF IT MUST BE

01:34:12.313 --> 01:34:16.984
PAID. UP FOR STUDENTS. FOUR

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:17.918
THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:19.820
DOLLARS RIGHT NOW- AND SO- THE

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:20.955
INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL JUST TO

01:34:23.491 --> 01:34:25.459
STUDENT SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS-

01:34:25.526 --> 01:34:27.895
WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT THEY

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:33.000
TOO WERE FACING COST PRESSURES.

01:34:33.067 --> 01:34:34.101
WE DOMINATE COMMENT ON THIS

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:39.974
PROPOSAL. A SMALL PROPOSAL IN

01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:41.609
THE RELATIVE SCHEME OF THINGS

01:34:41.675 --> 01:34:45.312
QUESTIONS MISTER DONNA. YEAH I

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:46.781
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.649
THIS PROPOSAL I'M STILL A LITTLE

01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:49.884
CONFUSED HERE. YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.653
TUITION. IS THIS ONE SCHOOL IN

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.790
ONE PLACE IS. A GRANT PROGRAM

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.658
I'M CONFUSED ABOUT WE'RE GIVING.

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.527
WE'RE ALLOCATING IN THE STATE

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:01.462
BUDGET MONEY FOR ONE SCHOOL. TO

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:06.000
HAVE SUMMER SCHOOL. SO AT WHAT

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.101
THE SUMMER SCHOOL FOR THE ARTS

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:09.637
IS ACTUALLY A SPECIFIC PROGRAM

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:10.838
THAT STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT

01:35:10.905 --> 01:35:12.073
THE STATE CAN APPLY TO ATTEND

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:13.674
OVER THE SUMMER IT'S DEFINITELY

01:35:13.741 --> 01:35:15.876
ARTS FOCUSED- IT I BELIEVE IT'S

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:17.778
A FOUR WEEK COURSE UP FOR THE

01:35:17.845 --> 01:35:19.747
STUDENTS THAT ARE ABLE TO ATTEND

01:35:19.814 --> 01:35:21.215
I IN ANY GIVEN YEAR THE SUMMER

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:23.250
SCHOOL ATTEMPTS TO I ENROLLED AT

01:35:23.317 --> 01:35:25.252
LEAST AROUND FIVE FORTY FIVE

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:26.887
HUNDRED STUDENTS- THERE IS A

01:35:26.954 --> 01:35:28.656
TUITION COMPONENT SO THERE THERE

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:29.957
BUDGET IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:32.359
TUITION COVERS PART OF THE COST.

01:35:32.426 --> 01:35:33.394
AND STATE GENERAL FUND FOR A

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:35.096
NUMBER OF YEARS DISCOVERED

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.797
ANOTHER PORTION OF THE COSTS OF

01:35:36.864 --> 01:35:38.466
THEIR IT'S BEEN HISTORICALLY

01:35:38.532 --> 01:35:39.934
SPLIT BETWEEN THE TWO IT'S A

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.202
RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT I

01:35:41.268 --> 01:35:42.937
BELIEVE THEIR BASE BUDGET- IN

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.672
GENERAL FUND TERMS IS AROUND ONE

01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.240
POINT FOUR MILLION- IN YOU'LL

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:48.175
THE EACH YEAR SO THESE

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:48.976
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.145
INTENDED TO YOU KNOW HELP THE

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:53.247
SCHOOL SERVE THAT SAME COHORT

01:35:53.314 --> 01:35:55.883
FOCUS ON SERVING. STUDENTS FROM

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.919
UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES-

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.988
SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:36:01.055 --> 01:36:02.089
ATTEND THE SCHOOL- WITHOUT YOU

01:36:02.156 --> 01:36:03.591
KNOW HAVING TO SEE THE SCHOOL

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.493
INCREASED TUITION OR YOU KNOW

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:08.896
REDUCE ACCESS TO STUDENTS. THIS

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:11.932
IS A PUBLIC SCHOOL. THE CHARGES

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:16.103
TUITION FOR THE SUMMER PROGRAM.

01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:18.372
IT'S A IT'S A PUBLIC SUMMER

01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:20.741
PROGRAM BUT IT'S NOT A SCHOOL IN

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.309
THE TRADITIONAL SENSE THAT WE

01:36:22.376 --> 01:36:24.145
THINK OF A YEAR ROUND SCHOOL SO

01:36:24.211 --> 01:36:25.946
IT'S NOT SUMMER SPECIFIC IT

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:27.882
THERE ARE FOUR- FULL TIME

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:29.917
EMPLOYEES THAT OPERATE THE

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.385
PROGRAM AND SET UP THE SUMMER

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:33.387
PROGRAM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:35.055
STUDENTS TO ATTEND BUT IT'S NOT

01:36:35.122 --> 01:36:37.324
A TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DO WE IS IT

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:41.295
IS IT'S A ONE SITE. RIGHT GOT IT

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:42.930
I BELIEVE IT'S AT ONE SITE- I

01:36:42.997 --> 01:36:44.331
FORGET THE EXACT LOCATION I

01:36:44.398 --> 01:36:46.200
BELIEVE IT'S SINCE OUTS

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:49.136
FRANTICALLY RITA. OKAY AND- DO

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.437
WE KNOW WHAT THE STUDENT

01:36:50.504 --> 01:36:51.805
POPULATIN THE STUDENT MAKE UP

01:36:51.872 --> 01:36:54.441
IS THERE IS A DIVERSITY. CHOI I

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:55.943
DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE-

01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:57.978

THAT'S THAT'S SPECIFIC TO. MATH

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:28.321

01:45:28.388 --> 01:45:29.823
FUNDING GETS TO THOSE SUBJECT

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:32.092

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.994
THAT THEY WOULD PRIORITIZE. MATH

01:45:34.061 --> 01:45:37.664
AND SCIENCE ACCORDINGLY- ALL

01:45:37.731 --> 01:45:38.665
DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUE AMBER

THAT AT THE CORE SUBJECT AREAS

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:46.473
WERE ONE OF THE AREAS OF FOCUS

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:47.974
UNDER THE EDUCATOR EFFECTIVENESS

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.976
BLOCK GRANT- TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:52.412
POINT. THERE THERE WERE SEVERAL-

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:54.614
FOCUS AREAS IN WHICH LOCAL

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.816
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COULD

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:57.751
CHOOSE TO PURSUE PROFESSIONAL

01:45:57.818 --> 01:46:00.187
DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS INVESTMENT

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:02.589
IS REALLY TARGETED AT TRYING TO-

01:46:02.656 --> 01:46:04.191
INCENTIVIZE AND ENCOURAGE

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:05.025
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.993
SPECIFICALLY IN MATH AND SCIENCE

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:08.495
RECOGNIZING THAT THEY COULD THEY

01:46:08.562 --> 01:46:10.530
COULD HAVE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:11.631
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN

01:46:11.698 --> 01:46:13.433
THOSE AREAS UNDER THE INITIAL%

01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:14.735
INVESTMENT. BUT RECOGNIZING ALSO

01:46:14.801 --> 01:46:16.103
THE COMPETING PRIORITIES AND

01:46:16.169 --> 01:46:17.337
WANTING TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:18.905
A SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL

01:46:18.972 --> 01:46:21.108
DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING IN THE

01:46:21.174 --> 01:46:23.043
CORE SUBJECTS. OKAY AND I KNOW

01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.078
THAT THE COMMISSION HAS HAD A

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:28.482
LOT OF IDEAS AND- WITH A LOT OF

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:30.183
RESEARCH ON WHAT'S THE MOST

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:32.719
EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET PEOPLE IN

01:46:32.786 --> 01:46:33.620
THE TEACHER. PROFESSION AND

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.655
OBVIOUSLY WE HAD A MAJOR TEACHER

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:38.592
SHORTAGES ATTACHMENT TO MANY-

01:46:38.658 --> 01:46:39.960
EMERGENCY CREDENTIALED TEACHERS

01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:41.261
IN CLASSROOM THAT YOU KNOW

01:46:41.328 --> 01:46:43.597
UNFORTUNATELY HARD PROBABLY A

01:46:43.663 --> 01:46:45.532
QUICK TO SERVE OUR ALL OF OUR

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:48.769
KIDS. SO THERE'S A BIG LIST OF

01:46:48.835 --> 01:46:50.570
IDEAS WE FUNDED. WHAT IF THE

01:46:50.637 --> 01:46:53.340
LAST FEW YEARS AND SOME NEW ONES

01:46:53.406 --> 01:46:55.475
THIS YEAR SO ONE THAT HAD BEEN-

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:57.511
ADDRESS OF THE YEARS I KNOW BY

01:46:57.577 --> 01:46:59.379
THE COMMISSION AS WELL. IS IT

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:00.981
INTEGRATED TEACHER PREP PROGRAM

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:03.517
SO SENSE STATE. FOUR YEAR DEGREE

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:07.454
ITSELF TO. FOR GO TO GETTING A

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:09.656
JOB BY BORROWING MORE MONEY TO

01:47:09.723 --> 01:47:12.893
GO TO- COLLEGE FOR ONE MORE YEAR

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:14.494
AND THEN GETTING A JOB THAT MAY

01:47:14.561 --> 01:47:17.764
NOT BE AS MUCH AS YOU WHAT I GOT

01:47:17.831 --> 01:47:18.498
WHEN YOU LEFT THE FOR YOU TO

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.634
REACH FOR ANOTHER JOB. SO AND I

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.869
SHOULD BE AN EFFORT. PRIORITIES

01:47:22.936 --> 01:47:24.871
TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO GRADUATE

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:26.573
WITHIN FOUR YEARS SAID. CURIOUS

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.510
WHY THOSE TYPE OF- IDEAS. AREN'T

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.712
HERE. I'M SO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:34.915
BUDGET DID INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL

01:47:34.981 --> 01:47:36.683
TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT

01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:38.018
INTEGRATED UNDERGRADUATE TEACHER

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:40.854
PREPARATION PROGRAM- BUT THERE'S

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:43.256
MUCH MORE IN MAY SECURES WHY

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:45.458
INDIAN POP UP IN ME. I'LL DEFER

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:46.827
TO MY COLLEAGUE AMBER AT AMBER

01:47:46.893 --> 01:47:48.094
ALEXANDER AGAIN WOULD DEPARTMENT

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.196
OF FINANCE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:50.630
AWARE OF THAT THAT CONVERSATION

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:52.232
AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED WE ARE

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:53.900
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF TAT CONCEPT

01:47:53.967 --> 01:47:55.168
AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO

01:47:55.235 --> 01:47:57.204
CONTINUED CONVERSATION. WITH YOU

01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:59.272
AND WHAT THE ASSEMBLY STAFF-

01:47:59.339 --> 01:48:01.341
RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW IT IT

01:48:01.408 --> 01:48:04.211
SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS- A DESIRE

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:06.246
TO HAVE YOU KNOW LIKE WE INVEST

01:48:06.313 --> 01:48:08.181
MORE THAN WHAT HIS PROPOSED THE

01:48:08.248 --> 01:48:10.150
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- BUT I THINK

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:11.551
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OF

01:48:11.618 --> 01:48:13.987
THE COMMON GROUND AND THAT THERE

01:48:14.054 --> 01:48:16.223
IS AN INVESTMENT IN THAT AREA IN

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.390
WHICH TO START THE CONVERSATION.

01:48:17.457 --> 01:48:19.559
OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS MISTER

01:48:19.626 --> 01:48:21.261
DONNA I JUST WANT TO JUMP ON

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:23.930
YOUR LAST TOPIC THEY'RE THE

01:48:23.997 --> 01:48:24.965
INTEGRATED- PREPARATION PROGRAM

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:26.099
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THERE

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:28.101
WE'VE GIVEN OUT GRANTS TO

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:29.936
COLLEGES THE PLAN. AND SO

01:48:30.003 --> 01:48:32.639
APPARENTLY THEY MET AND PLANNED

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:35.442
. BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. OKAY SO

01:48:35.508 --> 01:48:36.943
ANOTHER WORDS THIS OUT AS A

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.678
PLANNING GRANT SO THEY HAD

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:40.680
MEETINGS WHEN THEY PLANNED BUT

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:42.749
NOTHING CHANGED I THINK WHAT

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.150
WE'RE HAVING IS A SITUATION

01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:46.286
WHERE THERE'S SOME RESISTANCE AT

01:48:46.353 --> 01:48:48.455
THE AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL TO

01:48:48.521 --> 01:48:50.090
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS BECAUSE THIS

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.458
IS A CHANGE WHEREIN ONE CAN GET

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:52.926
A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND A

01:48:52.993 --> 01:48:54.527
TEACHING CREDENTIAL INSIDE THAT

01:48:54.594 --> 01:48:56.363
FOR YOUR EXPERIENCE SO THAT IS

01:48:56.429 --> 01:48:58.398
NEW TO SOME YOU UNIVERSITY

01:48:58.465 --> 01:49:01.334
SUMMER RESISTANT. BUT WE STE WE

01:49:01.401 --> 01:49:03.737
HAVE THE LAW PASSED FOR A REASON

01:49:03.803 --> 01:49:07.107
I WAS THE AUTHOR OF IT. AND WHAT

01:49:07.173 --> 01:49:08.975
I'M SAYING IS WE GIVE THESE

01:49:09.042 --> 01:49:10.377
AGAIN THESE PLAN GRANTS GO OUT

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:12.045
OF THEIR THERE'S NOTHING AT THE

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:13.146
END THAT WE TOUCH IS NO

01:49:13.213 --> 01:49:15.148
TANGIBLES IN OUTCOMES THE A THEY

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:17.050
REALLY SHOULDN'T BE PLANNING

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:18.051
GRANTS THEY SHOULD BE

01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:19.886
IMPLEMENTATION. GRANTS SO I HOPE

01:49:19.953 --> 01:49:21.154
WE CAN CHANGE THE WORDING THE

01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:24.090
FOCUS. SO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION

01:49:24.157 --> 01:49:26.526
GRANTS NOT PLANNING GRANTS. AS

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:26.993
FAR AS I CAN TELL MANY

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.729
UNIVERSITIES GOT THE- GOT THE

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:30.797
PLANNING GRANT. I MEAN IT'S NICE

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:33.066
LUNCHES ETCETERA. BUT THEY PLAN

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:34.768
I'M SURE THEY PLAN. BUT THEN

01:49:34.834 --> 01:49:35.835
AGAIN WHAT'S THE END PRODUCT

01:49:35.902 --> 01:49:37.737
THERE'S NO END PRODUCTS AGAIN.

01:49:37.804 --> 01:49:39.873
IMPLEMENTATION NOT PLANNING I

01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:44.110
THINK YOU GET IT THANK YOU. OKAY

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:50.283
JOIN RESPOND- YES SO THE TEN

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:50.984
MILLION INCLUDED IN THE

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:53.586
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- IS FOR

01:49:53.653 --> 01:49:58.024
IMPLEMENTATION- BUT I WE

NEGOTIATIONS. CAN I MISTER YES

01:50:06.066 --> 01:50:08.234
SO ONE SO THEY ARE FOR

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:13.273
IMPLEMENTATION- GRANTS. I DON'T

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.441
KNOW HOW SPECIFIC THE LANGUAGE

01:50:14.507 --> 01:50:17.711
IS. BUT IS THERE GOING TO BE

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:18.745
SOMETHING TANGIBLE THAT COMES

01:50:18.812 --> 01:50:19.980
OUT OF A- AT OF THAT GRANTS ARE

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:22.682
THE IS THE UNIVERSITY GOING TO

01:50:22.749 --> 01:50:23.783
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM ARE THEY

01:50:23.850 --> 01:50:25.185
JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:26.486
AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BUDGET

01:50:26.553 --> 01:50:28.054
BILL LANGUAGE DOES GIVE- THE

01:50:28.121 --> 01:50:28.788
COMMISSION ON TEACHER

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.156
CREDENTIALING QUITE A BIT OF

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:32.192
FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THAT THE

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:34.294
DESIGN OF THAT PROGRAM I KNOW

01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:35.095
THEY- THEY ARE LISTENING I

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.096
IMAGINE THAT THEY WILL BE TAKING

01:50:36.162 --> 01:50:37.230
THOSE COMMENTS INTO

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:39.232
CONSIDERATION AS THEY CRAFT. THE

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.001
PROGRAM ASSUMING THAT IT DOES-

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.602
GET GET ADOPTED IN SOME FORM.

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:45.205
SOMEONE NEEDS TO DROP A HAMMER

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.007
HERE TO GET THESE PROGRAMS UP

01:50:47.073 --> 01:50:48.508
AND GOING- WE'RE CLEARLY MEETING

01:50:48.575 --> 01:50:49.376
RESISTANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.311
LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S- NOT MAYBE

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:52.145
THE WAY THEY'VE- ALWAYS DONE

01:50:52.212 --> 01:50:54.547
THINGS- THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS

01:50:54.614 --> 01:50:56.282
SINCE I THINK NINETEEN SIXTIES

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:58.385
SO IT IS A BIG CHANGE. BUT IT'S

01:50:58.451 --> 01:50:59.919

SO WE DON'T WANT TO PAY PEOPLE

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:33.886
YOU KNOW LIVING WAGE IS NOT

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:36.121
PARTY WAGES. AND SO WE'RE NOT-

ABSOLUTELY SHOULD LOOK AT SO

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:18.243
THAT OUR CHILD CARE FACILITIES.

02:10:33.926 --> 02:10:35.327
THAT WE DON'T HAVE OUR CHILD

02:10:35.394 --> 02:10:38.497

WHERE WE SAY WE SHOULD BE AT

02:11:12.364 --> 02:11:14.132
THIS EIGHTY FIFTH PERCENTILE AND

02:11:14.199 --> 02:11:16.635
WERE BELOW THAT BY TEN POINTS OR

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:18.303
SO SAYS AND THAT THE STUDY THAT

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.839

AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN ARMOR

02:11:38.824 --> 02:11:40.626
SURVEY I GET THAT BUT AGAIN OF

02:11:46.498 --> 02:11:48.333
L. CAN HELP US LIKE LESS THAN A

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:51.570

REGIONAL MARKET RATE. I THINK

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:09.688
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED

02:12:09.755 --> 02:12:11.456
AFFECTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:13.125

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:14.693
AT THIS POINT WE'RE AT SEVENTY

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:15.927
FIFTH OF THE RETAIL MARKET RATE

RATE AND MANY OF THEM WERE VERY

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.406
FAR BELOW THAT THE- REASON ORDER

02:12:27.472 --> 02:12:29.608
HAVE MOVED UP BUT STILL. THE

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.776
SEVENTY FIFTH ALONG WITH THE-

02:12:30.842 --> 02:12:32.377

DEMOCRATS SO PRIOR TO THAT

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:22.614
PANDEMIC WE ALSO HAVE WITH THE

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.983
SYSTEM ITSELF WAS QUITE FRAGILE

02:15:25.050 --> 02:15:26.785
WITH THE PANDEMIC OBVIOUSLY IT

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:28.453
IS STARTING TO REALLY BECOME

02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:30.155
EVEN MORE FRAGILE AND WE HEAR

02:15:30.222 --> 02:15:31.523
THAT WE HEAR FROM THE STAKE

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:33.358
HOLDERS WE HAVE MEETINGS WITH

02:15:33.425 --> 02:15:35.227

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:39.030
WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT WE CAN SAY

02:15:39.097 --> 02:15:42.767
IS THAT THE MULTI YEAR INVEST.

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:43.401
FOR ONE TWENTY TWO THAT CLOSELY

02:15:43.468 --> 02:15:45.036
BEEN THROUGH TWENTY THREE THAT

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:46.538
MANY OF YOU WERE CHAMPIONS AT

02:15:46.605 --> 02:15:48.673
THAT IS A FIRST START FOR THAT

02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.442
WE KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT THE

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:53.111
ONLY STEPS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:54.179
AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND I

02:15:54.246 --> 02:15:56.047
THINK THAT THE PERMANENT FINANCE

02:15:56.114 --> 02:15:58.316
CALLED THAT OUT ALSO BUT WE KNOW

02:15:58.383 --> 02:15:59.484
THAT THAT WAS A BIG LEAP WITH

02:15:59.551 --> 02:16:01.653
THAT NOW THE RATE REFORM GROUP

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:02.921
THAT WE ARE HAPPY AND THAT IS

02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:04.890
PART OF A WORK GROUP THAT'S MADE

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:09.427
UP OF NOT ONLY WORKGROUP MEMBERS

02:16:09.494 --> 02:16:11.663
THAT ARE STILL. OUT AND THE

02:16:11.730 --> 02:16:13.798
PEOPLE THAT. BUT JUST HOW- AND

02:16:13.865 --> 02:16:16.568
OTHER. I ARE REALLY MAKE. A

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:17.969
DIFFERENCE IN REGARDS TO BOISE

02:16:18.036 --> 02:16:20.472
IN WHAT IS THIS NEW SYSTEM- WHAT

02:16:20.539 --> 02:16:22.274
WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS WHAT I

02:16:22.340 --> 02:16:23.708
APPRECIATE ABOUT THE GROUP IS

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.243
THAT THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:27.045
WHICH WAS WHAT. AND THERE WAS

02:16:27.112 --> 02:16:28.580
FOR IT REFERENCING IS SOMETHING

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:29.981
THAT WE ARE LOOKING A LITTLE BIT

02:16:30.048 --> 02:16:31.483
DIFFERENTLY WE'RE LOOKING THAT

02:16:31.550 --> 02:16:33.685
UP NOW TURNED IT UP METHODOLOGY.

02:16:33.752 --> 02:16:34.553
THAT'LL TURN A METHODOLOGY

02:16:34.619 --> 02:16:36.621
LOOKED TRUE COST OF CARE. I

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:37.889
THINK THAT IN ITSELF IS

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:39.491
SOMETHING THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:41.393
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PLANNING

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:42.227
TOGETHER ONCE WE HAVE THAT

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:45.597
INFORMATION. SO THOSE ARE SOME

02:16:45.664 --> 02:16:46.798
OF THE STEPS- AND THEN WE TO CAN

02:16:46.865 --> 02:16:49.367
GET STIPENDS WE HAD SIGNIFICANT

02:16:49.434 --> 02:16:51.102
INVESTMENTS IN STATEMENTS THAT

02:16:51.169 --> 02:16:54.773
WERE. SUPPLEMENTAL IT'S TO OUR-

02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:56.207
YEAH I'M WORKFORCE SO YES WE

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:58.810
HAVE READ FOR. WE HAVE. INCREASE

02:16:58.877 --> 02:17:00.979
AN- BUT WE- HAD SUPPLEMENTAL TOO

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:03.348
SO. THAT AND THAT WENT TO THE

02:17:03.415 --> 02:17:06.785
MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM SO NOT ONLY

02:17:06.851 --> 02:17:12.857
DID IT GO TO OUR STEPS AND. AND

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:14.125
EVEN IF SYMPATHY FOR THE STATE

02:17:14.192 --> 02:17:17.696
BUT IT ALSO IN. A REVISED THIS.

02:17:17.762 --> 02:17:18.997
MAYBE SERVING A 100% UNTIL. SO

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:21.199
IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO BE ABLE TO

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:23.034
AT LEAST PROVIDE ONE STEP TO

02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:24.669
SUPPORT THE FIELD DURING THESE

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:27.238
I'M PRESIDENT TIMES YEAH. SO THE

02:17:27.305 --> 02:17:29.341
FAMILY FEES ARE A PIECE OF THE

02:17:29.407 --> 02:17:30.475
PUZZLE IN. THE SUMMER RACES BEEN

02:17:30.542 --> 02:17:32.544
CHAMPING THIS AND WE'VE BEEN

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.579
SUPPORT OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:36.214
TO. WAIVE THEM AND GET RID OF

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:41.252
THAT CAN BE IS JUST GET THEM. IT

02:17:41.319 --> 02:17:42.887
THAT PERFECTLY STYLE TO KEEP

02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:44.389
COMING BACK TO THIS. BUT THE A

02:17:44.456 --> 02:17:46.424
PIECE OF THE PIE. EVEN IF THEY

02:17:46.491 --> 02:17:48.393
ARE. IF THEY'RE WAY DOWN THERE

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:50.762
YOU KNOW SOMEHOW AFFORDABLE THAT

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:52.130
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND A

02:17:52.197 --> 02:17:54.399
SPOT. AND BARS I HEAR A DOWNTURN

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:55.867
ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO WHAT

02:17:55.934 --> 02:17:59.270
ARE THE SHUTTERED LOCATIONS

02:17:59.337 --> 02:18:01.940
TELLING YOU. OUR DEPARTMENT OR

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:05.043
CALIFORNIA WHAT WE NEED TO DO

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.411
WHAT THEY TELL US ALL THE TIME

02:18:06.478 --> 02:18:08.179
IS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY

02:18:08.246 --> 02:18:09.781
WOULD YOU OPEN A BUSINESS

02:18:09.848 --> 02:18:12.150
WHETHER IT'S A SANDWICH SHOP A

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:14.019
DRY CLEANER ANYTHING ELSE FOR

02:18:14.085 --> 02:18:16.955
YOUR- REVENUE COMING IN DOESN'T

02:18:17.022 --> 02:18:19.824
EQUAL THE COSTS. YEAH KEEP IT TO

02:18:19.891 --> 02:18:22.661
OPERATE AND MAKE IT ALL GOES

02:18:22.727 --> 02:18:28.266
BACK TO THIS. RATE STRUCTURE SO. I ARE I AM AM I MISSING

02:18:28.333 --> 02:18:30.001
SOMETHING. I THINK I WOULD CREE

02:18:30.068 --> 02:18:31.503
EMPHASIZE AGAIN WHAT WE

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:34.139
CURRENTLY ARE- IMPLEMENTING THIS

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:35.907
CURRENT YEAR AS WELL AS WHAT WE

02:18:35.974 --> 02:18:38.276
PROPOSE LIKE YOU'VE MENTIONED-

02:18:38.343 --> 02:18:40.178
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A HOLD

02:18:40.245 --> 02:18:42.080
HARMLESS AN EXTENSION WHICH YES

02:18:42.147 --> 02:18:43.615
I BELIEVE THAT THE FAMILY FEES

02:18:43.682 --> 02:18:45.550
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO WAVE OFF

02:18:45.617 --> 02:18:47.252
OF TO WAIT BUT WE ALSO HAVE A

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:48.720
HOLD HARMLESS. HOLD HARMLESS

02:18:48.787 --> 02:18:50.989
SPECIFICALLY MEANS THAT THESE

02:18:51.056 --> 02:18:53.058
SITES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:18:53.124 --> 02:18:57.195
RECEIVE YOUR- AND REIMBURSEMENT-

02:18:57.262 --> 02:18:59.197
AND SO IT'S NOT SO MUCH BASED ON

02:18:59.264 --> 02:19:01.499
ATTENDANCE BUT BASED ON- BUT

02:19:01.566 --> 02:19:03.168
BASED ON ENROLLMENT THAT

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:04.969
SIGNIFICANTLY HELP STABILIZES

02:19:05.036 --> 02:19:07.138
THE FIELD TOO SO THAT'S ANOTHER

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:08.239
PIECE THAT IS PART OF THIS

02:19:08.306 --> 02:19:10.175
BUDGET THAT HAS BEEN EXTENDED

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:11.276
FOR ONE MORE YEAR. BUT AGAIN

02:19:11.342 --> 02:19:12.744
WE'RE WORKS CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:15.213
CONVERSATIONS AND WE WANT TO

02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:16.181
CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE BECAUSE

02:19:16.247 --> 02:19:18.016
WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME WORK AHEAD

02:19:18.083 --> 02:19:20.752
OF US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MEET

02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:21.352
OUR LONG TERM GOALS THAT WERE

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:24.489
IDENTIFIED IN THE MASTER PLAN.

02:19:24.556 --> 02:19:27.459
OF EARLY LEARNING. SO AGAIN WHO

02:19:27.525 --> 02:19:28.660
WHAT ARE THE CENTER IS TELLING

02:19:28.727 --> 02:19:32.530
YOU. THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO

02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:35.667
. IS THIS IS IT ARE THEY TELLING

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:36.301
YOU THE SAME THING THEY TELL US

02:19:36.367 --> 02:19:37.869
THE RATES SO THE CENTERS ARE

02:19:37.936 --> 02:19:39.671
TELLING US QUITE A FEW THINGS

02:19:39.738 --> 02:19:41.072
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:42.841
HEARD FROM THE CENTERS WITH THE

02:19:42.907 --> 02:19:43.842
HOLD HARMLESS RIGHT THAT WAS

02:19:43.908 --> 02:19:45.043
SOMETHING THAT THE TITLE FIVE

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.011
CENTERS WERE CALLING I THINK WE

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:48.346
HEARD IT IN THE STAKEHOLDER

02:19:48.413 --> 02:19:50.081
FEEDBACK AND WE ALSO HEARD IN

02:19:50.148 --> 02:19:51.816
THE LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS AND WE

ALL RECEIVED. LETTERS ON THE

02:19:53.084 --> 02:19:55.086
IMPORTANCE OF THAT AND THIS MAY

02:19:55.153 --> 02:19:58.323
PROPOSAL- ADDRESS THAT AND THAT

02:19:58.389 --> 02:20:00.225
TOO WE ALSO HEARD FROM OUR RATE

02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:02.160
REFORM WORK GROUP IN REGARDS TO

02:20:02.227 --> 02:20:04.162
THE LOOKING AT THE RATE

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:05.663
STRUCTURE AND THE RATE REFORM

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.532
WORK GROUP HAS. COME IN FOR

02:20:07.599 --> 02:20:09.801
THEIR COMEDY AND THE IMPORTANCE

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:11.469
OF THE OTHER ALTERNATE

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:13.104
METHODOLOGY AND BE ABLE TO LOOK

02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:14.939
AT TO COST OF CARE SO WE'RE ALSO

02:20:15.006 --> 02:20:16.341
HEARING ABOUT THAT ALSO SO

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:17.442
THERE'S DIFFERENT PIECES THAT

02:20:17.509 --> 02:20:19.244
ASK FOR HEARING WERE ALSO MAKING

02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:20.945
SURE THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER

02:20:21.012 --> 02:20:24.749
TO BE ABLE. TO THINK ABOUT THIS

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:26.785
LONG TERM SYSTEM. OKAY ACTIMIZE

02:20:26.851 --> 02:20:29.487
RACE. JUST PUTTING THINGS INTO

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:31.689
PERSPECTIVE WHEN THE STUDY WAS

02:20:31.756 --> 02:20:33.458
DONE FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWO

02:20:33.525 --> 02:20:34.459
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE MINIMUM

02:20:34.526 --> 02:20:36.261
WAGE IN CALIFORNIA WAS ELEVEN

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:39.063
DOLLARS PER HOUR. TWENTY TWENTY

02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:40.732
TWO MINIMUM WAGE IN CALIFORNIA'S

02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:43.134
FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. THAT'S

02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:46.304
A 27% INCREASE JUST IN THE COST

02:20:46.371 --> 02:20:49.541
OF WORKERS' SALARIES. AB WE ARE

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:52.777
CURRENTLY FUNDING IT AT THE

02:20:52.844 --> 02:20:55.580
TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IF THE MAY

02:20:55.647 --> 02:20:57.982
REVISION ALSO PROPOSES ANOTHER

02:20:58.049 --> 02:20:59.918
INCREASE TO FIFTEEN FIFTY PER

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.986
HOUR WHICH BRINGS THE INCREASE

02:21:02.053 --> 02:21:08.259
TO THIRTY PERCENT. TOTAL. THE

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:10.361
MAY REVISE GIVES NO ADDITIONAL

02:21:10.428 --> 02:21:12.263
FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:15.066
TO PAY THE WORKERS AT THE

02:21:15.133 --> 02:21:17.335
CURRENT LEVEL. IF YOU WERE ONE

02:21:17.402 --> 02:21:18.803
OF THE COMMENTS THAT AND I KNOW

02:21:28.446 --> 02:21:29.447
IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASK ANSWER

02:21:29.514 --> 02:21:32.383
THEM YOU KNOW SIMPLY HERE

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:33.184
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:35.486
DIFFERENT FACTORS BUT I THINK AS

02:21:35.553 --> 02:21:38.156
WE WORK TO FINALIZE THE BUDGET

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:39.023
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY

02:21:39.090 --> 02:21:40.992
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THAT HAS

02:21:41.059 --> 02:21:44.662

TELL YOU THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:53.238
THAT THE GOVERNOR DIDN'T INCLUDE

02:21:53.304 --> 02:21:57.809
THIS- IT IDENTICAL THE FUNDING-

02:21:57.876 --> 02:21:59.344
TO RAISE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES

02:21:59.410 --> 02:22:01.145
FOR HEAD START TEACHERS.

02:22:01.212 --> 02:22:02.013
SALARIES FOR HEAD START

02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:05.917
TEACHERS. ARE DEEPLY EQUITABLE

02:22:05.984 --> 02:22:07.852
WHEN YOU COMPARE THE T. TWO K.

02:22:07.919 --> 02:22:10.855

LOSING OUR TEACHERS. AND IT IS A

02:22:32.176 --> 02:22:34.245
PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT

02:22:34.312 --> 02:22:37.782
WE- SOMEHOW NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:39.851

CCP YOU CONTRACTED GIVE YOU KNOW

02:23:33.304 --> 02:23:37.175
THAT ENTITY IN THAT WORK FORCE-

ABLE TO COLLECTIVELY ORGANIZED

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:45.616
BUT WE KEEP GOING BACK TO

02:23:45.683 --> 02:23:47.151
SOMETIMES ADMINISTRATION AND

02:23:47.218 --> 02:23:48.252
FINANCE DEPARTMENT SO YOU KNOW

02:23:48.319 --> 02:23:50.555
WE CAN'T WORK ON ALL THESE OTHER

02:23:50.621 --> 02:23:52.457
RATES BECAUSE THE WE NEED TO

02:23:52.523 --> 02:23:54.359
MAKE SURE WE FOCUS ON THIS PIECE

02:23:54.425 --> 02:23:57.095
SO HOW MUCH OF THE OVERALL PIE

02:23:57.161 --> 02:24:00.098
IS C. C. P. U. S. ALL OTHERS

02:24:00.164 --> 02:24:04.535
THAT ARE IMPACTED. BY THE RATES

02:24:04.602 --> 02:24:07.372
AND POTENTIAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:09.307
YEAH I THINK IT THANK YOU FOR

02:24:09.374 --> 02:24:11.409
THE QUESTION SO TO CLARIFY-

02:24:11.476 --> 02:24:12.443
THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF

02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:13.644
PROGRAMS ARE CENTER BASED

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:15.613
PROGRAMS. FAMILY CHILD CARE

02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:18.683
HOMES AND LICENSE EXEMPT SO OF

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:19.984
THOSE THREE FAMILY CHILD CARE

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:23.054
HOME PROVIDERS AND LICENSE EXAM

02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:24.822
PROVIDERS ARE THAT RECEIVE

02:24:24.889 --> 02:24:27.592
SEVENTY SIX. ARE REPRESENTED BY.

02:24:27.658 --> 02:24:30.495
BY THE UNION- AT THE CENTER

02:24:30.561 --> 02:24:32.997
BASED PROGRAMS ARE NOT. BASED ON

02:24:33.064 --> 02:24:35.266
DATA FROM OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY

02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:37.235
SO THIS IS PRE TRANSITION OF

02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:38.903
CHILD CARE TO DEPARTMENT OF

02:24:38.970 --> 02:24:41.472
SOCIAL SERVICES- SO THIS

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:44.008
INCLUDES. ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:24:44.075 --> 02:24:45.877
STATE PRESCHOOL CAL WORK STAGES

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:48.579
TWO AND THREE. FAMILY CHILDCARE

02:24:48.646 --> 02:24:50.848
HOME NETWORKS GENERAL CHILDCARE

02:24:50.915 --> 02:24:52.950
ARE MIGRANT PROGRAMS ND THAT

02:24:53.017 --> 02:24:54.185
CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH SEVERE

02:24:54.252 --> 02:24:56.654
DISABILITIES PROGRAMS. OF THOSE

02:24:56.721 --> 02:25:00.324
ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS 55% OF

02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:01.426
SEARCH OF CHILDREN THAT WERE

02:25:01.492 --> 02:25:03.428
ENROLLED IN CTE PROGRAMS IN

02:25:03.494 --> 02:25:05.930
OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY. WERE I'M

02:25:05.997 --> 02:25:08.599
IN CENTER BASED PROGRAMS SO OVER

02:25:08.666 --> 02:25:10.701
HALF OF CHILDREN AND ROLLED OUT

02:25:10.768 --> 02:25:13.604
WERE RECEIVING CARE AND A CENTER

02:25:13.671 --> 02:25:16.340
PROGRAM. WHEREAS 31% OR IN

02:25:16.407 --> 02:25:18.242
FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES AND

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:21.579
ABOUT 15% WERE IN LICENSE EXEMPT

02:25:21.646 --> 02:25:23.281
NOW THEY EXACT PERCENTAGES VARY

02:25:23.347 --> 02:25:26.451
BY PROGRAM AND SO I WOULD DEFER

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:27.552
TO DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

02:25:27.618 --> 02:25:29.253
ON MORE CURRENT ESTIMATES FOR

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:35.827
THEIR PROGRAMS. I WILL SAY THT. FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:25:35.893 --> 02:25:37.161
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE MAJORITY

02:25:37.228 --> 02:25:38.262
OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE

02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:39.397
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IS OPERATED

02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:41.866
AND CENTERS. WELL I'M NOT SURE I

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:43.468
KIND OF GOT THE MATH BUT IN

02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:45.369
PLAIN ENGLISH IT SEEMS THAT THE

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:47.071
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ARE NOT

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:49.841
PART OF THE C. C. P.'S CONTRACT

02:25:49.907 --> 02:25:51.242
SO IT SEEMS THAT THE STATE

02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:53.311
SOMETIMES STALLS AND SAYS OH

02:25:53.377 --> 02:25:54.946
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THE RIGHT

02:25:55.012 --> 02:25:56.948
THING BECAUSE WE NEED TO. FOCUS

02:25:57.014 --> 02:25:58.883
ON THE CONTRACT AND IT JUST IT

02:25:58.950 --> 02:26:00.518
HOLDS IT UP FOR EVERYBODY ELSE

02:26:00.585 --> 02:26:02.920
AND SO I JUST THINK THAT'S A BIT

02:26:02.987 --> 02:26:04.655
OF A FALSE CHOICE IN IT.

02:26:04.722 --> 02:26:07.892
UNNECESSARILY DELAYS- ADDRESSING

02:26:07.959 --> 02:26:10.394
THIS ISSUE WHICH HE NO SIMPLE

02:26:10.461 --> 02:26:12.363
ECONOMICS IMPACTS THE OVERALL

02:26:12.430 --> 02:26:16.000
FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE CHILD

02:26:16.067 --> 02:26:17.068
CARE FIELD IN CALIFORNIA SO.

02:26:17.135 --> 02:26:18.936
WE'LL HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THIS

02:26:19.003 --> 02:26:20.905
WEEK'S COME BACK AND- NO ONE'S

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:31.749
THE AGENDA IS ITEMS. AND I THINK

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:45.696
