OF MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

00:31:28.886 --> 00:31:30.255

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:36.127
THAT LAST YEAR TWENTY TWENTY

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:36.728
WAS GONNA BE THE YEAR THAT WE

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:37.962
TACKLE THIS TOPIC. FOR GOVERNOR

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:39.330

CRISES THAT WE HAVE TO TACKLE

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:49.641
THIS PAST YEAR. DESPITE THIS

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.409
CRISIS THE ADMINISTRATION WORK

00:31:51.476 --> 00:31:53.077
WITH THE LEGISLATURE WORKED

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.078
HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:55.313
DIDN'T SEE EVEN HIGHER

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.781
SKYROCKETING RATES OF

00:31:56.848 --> 00:31:57.548

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:59.083

CRITICAL FUNDING THAT WE PUT

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:05.556
INTO LAW THIS BUDGET TO MOVE

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:08.559
LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSE THERE

00:32:08.626 --> 00:32:10.328
WERE HALF A DOZEN BILLS. THAT

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.196

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:13.965

STALLED OR GOT VETOED. AND I

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:17.435

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.070
A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION.

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:20.371

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.842
HOMELESSNESS. SHE WAS A MEMBER.

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.377
THUS FAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S

THESE ISSUES- I AGREE THAT THIS

IS A I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

00:34:57.662 --> 00:34:59.197
PERSISTENT AND CHALLENGING

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:00.398
PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES FACING THE

STATE OF CALIFORNIA I AGREE

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:02.433
THAT IT IS A GREAT MORAL

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.235
CHALLENGE. WHAT I'M HOPING TO

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.336

00:35:05.403 --> 00:35:06.838
ABOUT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:08.339
AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.841
STOPPING PEOPLE FROM FALLING

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:10.775
INTO HOMELESSNESS ARE CHARLIE

00:35:10.842 --> 00:35:13.711
TO THE- IDEA THAT THE COUNT BY-

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:15.680
BY- THE MOST RECENT TWO

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:16.747
THOUSAND NINE HONDA ACCOUNT.

00:35:16.814 --> 00:35:17.849
AND WHAT I FOUND MOST

00:35:17.915 --> 00:35:19.851
INTERESTING ABOUT IS THAT ON

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:21.152
AVERAGE EVERY DAY IN THE CITY

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:22.854
OF LOS ANGELES TWO HUNDRED

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.688

ANGELES FIND ADDITIONAL TWENTY

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:32.597
PEOPLE HUMAN BEINGS FRIENDS

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:34.098
NEIGHBORS PEOPLE THAT WE NEED

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:35.466
TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF. I THINK

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:36.601
IT'S IMPORTANT WE'RE FOCUSED ON

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.635
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THOSE ON

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:38.936
THE STREETS BUT I ALSO THINK IT

00:35:39.003 --> 00:35:40.204
IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT WE THINK

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:41.873
ABOUT HOW ARE WE PREVENTING

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:42.473
PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.175
IN THE FIRST PLACE. BECAUSE IF

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.276
WE DON'T ADDRESS THAT PART OF

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:47.512
THE EQUATION THAT WE ARE NEVER

00:35:47.578 --> 00:35:48.112
GOING TO DIG OURSELVES OUT OF

00:35:48.179 --> 00:35:49.847
THIS HOLE. THE OTHERS ARE VERY

00:35:49.914 --> 00:35:50.848
EAGER TO HEAR ABOUT AND HAVE A

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.350
DISCUSSION ABOUT IS THE ISSUE

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:53.417
OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.052
TRANSPARENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:55.753
WE ARE DOING DATA DRIVEN

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.755
POLICYMAKING. I THINK THIS IS

00:35:57.822 --> 00:35:58.623
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF OUR

00:35:58.689 --> 00:36:00.191
COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY IN

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:00.758
THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.593
FOCUSED ON. HOW DO WE BRING

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.661
SOME REAL ACCOUNTABILITY SO WE

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:04.896
HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:06.664
DOLLARS WE'RE SPENDING ARE

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:07.331
ACTUALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE ON

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:08.799
THIS PROBLEM. I WHAT I WORRY

00:36:08.866 --> 00:36:11.068
ABOUT IS THAT I'M NOT CONFIDENT

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.970
THAT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO COULD

00:36:13.037 --> 00:36:14.472
SWITCH OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:15.506
ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS AND

00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:16.507
WHICH ONES ARE REALLY GETTING

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.642
PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND SO I

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:18.576
THINK BRINGING SOME REAL

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.478
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

00:36:20.545 --> 00:36:21.946
TO WHICH OF THESE. INVESTMENTS

HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE WHICH OF

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.015
THE INVESTMENTS AT THE LOCAL

LEVEL HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE- IS

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:27.218

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.154

ISSUE AS COMPASSIONATELY AS

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:36.327
POSSIBLE TO HELP FOLKS IN OUR

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:37.261
COMMUNITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:38.563
BRING THEM OFF THE STREETS I

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.464
THINK WE NEED. MUCH BETTER DATA

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:03.107
DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ENSURE THAT

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.209
LOW INCOME RENTERS PAY NO MORE

THE THRESHOLD TO DISTINGUISH IT

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:15.753
SHOULD BE A RENT BURDEN. AND SO

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.821
WITH THAT IN MY ABILITY TO TURN

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:18.289
TO TAKE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE

00:39:18.355 --> 00:39:20.057
STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION.

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.292
BEFORE I DO I WANT TO PROVIDE A

00:39:21.358 --> 00:39:22.893
LITTLE CONTEXT INTO THE DATA

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.562
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE HERE.

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:26.063
THE STATE HAS HISTORICALLY

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.231
RELIED ON THE POINT IN TIME

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.966
COUNTS WHICH ON. MANY OF THE

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:30.101
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.103
NOTED IN THEIR OPENING COMMENTS

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.137
HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:34.305
CHALLENGES WITH THE WAY THAT

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:35.439
DATA IS COLLECTED AND LIKELY

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.742
REPRESENTED. UNDER COUNT OF THE

00:39:37.808 --> 00:39:39.243
NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.112
HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE. AND

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.279
THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS

00:39:42.346 --> 00:39:43.681
CREATED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.283
WITH THE DATA COLLECTION THE

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:47.718
TWENTY TWENTY DATA IS NOT YET

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:48.586
AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:39:50.254 --> 00:39:51.188
THEIR CHALLENGES WITH THE

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:53.858
UNSHELTERED COUNT THAT- YOU

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:54.658
KNOW IT WOULD GENERALLY TAKE

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:58.095
PLACE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR-

00:39:58.162 --> 00:40:00.164
BUT A LOT OF UPON A POINT OF AN

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:02.099
OPTIMISM IS THE NEW DATA SYSTEM

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:03.334
THAT THE STATE IS SETTING UP

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.935
THE HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.138
SYSTEM. WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.806
OPERATIONAL IN THE SPRING AND

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:09.907
WOULD BRING TOGETHER SOME

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:11.308
STANDARDIZED DATA. FROM THE

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:12.943

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.149
A REPLACEMENT OF THE POINT IN

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.583
TIME COUNT THE TO PROVIDE MORE

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:20.618
INFORMATION AND COULD BE A

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:25.089
VALUABLE. TO- MOVING FORWARD.

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:25.756
AND SO WHAT BETTER MIND THE NAY.

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:28.259
COULD OF PAGES HIGHLIGHT.

WILL BE SPENT QUITE QUICKLY.

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.125
I'M SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.460
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE'RE-

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:32.728

THINK IT WAS ON LIKE A BROKE

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.386
RECORD- BUT I THINK FOR SOME OF

01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:59.355
THE THINGS WE SUFFER FOR COPING

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:00.823
IN PARTICULAR. IT REALLY

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:02.324
DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF SERVICE

01:11:02.391 --> 01:11:04.059
SOMEONE IS RECEIVING AND SO YOU

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:06.028
KNOW WE STOPPED ABOUT FIVE

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:07.363
THOUSAND FOLKS I'M BEING

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:08.897
SERVED. FOR SOME OF THE

01:11:08.964 --> 01:11:11.200
CONCRETE SHELTERS IN AND KOBE-

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:13.335

SOME OF THE HYGIENE STATIONS

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:19.508
AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO- IT

01:11:19.575 --> 01:11:21.010
REALLY DOES DEPEND ON. THE KIND

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.111
OF LEVEL OF INTENSITY OF

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.846
SERVICE THAT'S BEING PROVIDED.

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:25.214
AND IS THERE THANK YOU AND IS

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:26.148

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:27.383
THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF A DATA

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.550
LACK HERE RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:29.551
NOT GOING TO GET. INTO MID

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.953
FEBRUARY NUMBERS FROM SEPTEMBER

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.321
IS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.288
WAIT SEVERAL MONTHS TO KNOW

01:11:33.355 --> 01:11:34.256
ABOUT WHETHER MONEY'S BEEN

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:35.658
SPENT I MEAN THAT SEEMS TO BE A

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:40.829
FAIRLY EASILY. EASY THING TO

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:43.666
KEEP TRACK OF. ORDERLY EXPECT.

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:45.668
REPORTS FROM. THE THAT REQUIRE

01:11:45.734 --> 01:11:47.036
SOME DELAY FROM THEM. ASK MORE

THAN THAT. THREE MONTHS WHICH

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.405
MORE THAN WHAT IS STATURE. WERE

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:51.140
BUT WE ARE GETTING. AT LEAST

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:52.241
YOU KNOW THEY THEY HAVE SOME

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:53.575
GREAT TEAM THEY NEED TO GET

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:54.510
THAT INFORMATION FROM THEIR SUB

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:55.844
GRANTEES. THEY NEED TO COLLECT

01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:57.046
THAT AND THEN SEND THAT TO US

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.080
AND THEN WE NEED TO ANALYZE IT

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.415
SO THERE IS A BIT OF A LACK OF

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:01.517
EXPENDITURE DATA- THAT'S THAT'S

01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:03.652

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:21.817
ALONG WITH THE DATA LAG AS A MY

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:24.152
COLLEAGUE LOS ANGELES MANSION-

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.487
IS THERE A WORK AROUND RIGHT

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.089
NOW WHERE I KNOW THAT COUNTIES

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:28.457
ARE COLLECTING BEARS H.

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:30.292
INPUTTING INFORMATION IN THEIR

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.261
LOCAL AGENT MY **** DO YOU GUYS

TO HAVE THAT. HAVE A OF A MORE

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:42.571
REAL TIME PICTURE. AS A WE AS

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:58.320
EACH DANCE WITHOUT GETTING TOO

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.488
IN THE WEEDS HERE THAT IS

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.256
EXACTLY WHAT THE SYSTEM WILL DO

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.858
I'M SO WE WILL BE COLLECTING

01:16:02.925 --> 01:16:04.726
ALL FORTY FOUR ZERO C. LOCAL

01:16:04.793 --> 01:16:06.962
HMIS DATA INTO ONE STATEWIDE

01:16:07.029 --> 01:16:08.797
WAREHOUSE I'M SO THAT WILL

01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:10.966
INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO HAVE AND

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:12.334
I'M AT THE DATA IS BEING

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:13.802
ENTERED IN DANGER WE WILL BE

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:16.538
DOING I'M A FREQUENT PULLED OF

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:19.007
THAT DATA. INTO THE H. CARE ACT

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.443
SYSTEM TO BE ABLE. TO LOOK AT

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:25.147
THAT. EXACTLY YES. ON SOME OF

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:27.349
THE OF YOUR MONEY WHAT THE TIME.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.051
FOR THIS I'M AWARE OF AS YOU

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.519
MENTIONED BEFORE WE'RE

01:16:30.585 --> 01:16:32.988
OPERATING ON. SIX MONTH SIX

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:36.591
MONTH OLD DATA- AND- SO- IT

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:38.260
WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT YOU JUST

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:41.263
CALL THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:44.166
ACCESS OR HMIS DATA. AGGREGATED

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.134
AND AT LEAST HAVE THAT GOING ON.

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:47.336
ISN'T THAT NOT KNOW OR MY

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:49.671
SIMPLIFYING IT. YEAH IT'S SADLY

01:16:49.738 --> 01:16:51.907
NOT THAT SIMPLE- WE WISH IT

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.642
WERE- IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:54.977
COMPLEX BERMAN DATA SECURITY

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.645
STANDPOINT FROM ACTUALLY

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:58.280
BUILDING THAT THE DATA SYSTEM

01:16:58.347 --> 01:16:59.915
ITSELF WE DO HAVE A VENDOR IN

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:01.917
PLACE RIGHT NOW- AND A TEAM OF

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.119
FOLKS AT WITHIN HCFC THAT ARE

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:07.222
ARE ARE VERY VERY- INTENSELY

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.957
BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEM WE HOPE

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:10.959
IT WILL BE READY- BY THE END OF

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.095
MARCH EARLY APRIL- FOR THE

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:15.530
PUBLIC J. C. DASHBOARD AND

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:16.865
THINGS LIKE OF THAT NATURE BUT-

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:17.899
I'M QUITE A BIT THAT IS

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:19.034
INVOLVED IN TEAMS OF PULLING

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.169
THAT DATA AND- THE DUPLICATING

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.238
AT DE IDENTIFYING IT AND BEING

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.473
ABLE THAT TO VISUALIZE IT IN

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.008
WAYS THAT MAKE SENSE FOR

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:28.844
GENERAL PUBLIC. OKAY TRANSIT I

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.045
WILL I'LL SAY THAT THE BIGGEST

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:32.447
FILLED WAS TOUTED AS ONE OF THE

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.816
FEW CITIES THAT THAT I GUESS I

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.551
STILL ZERO WE'RE NOW AS THE-

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:38.420
CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS BUT AT THE

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:40.589
SAME TIME. HOMELESSNESS IS

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.124
STILL A CHALLENGE JUST BASED ON

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.826
DEFINITION SO- I THINK I WOULD

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.528
ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY

01:17:46.595 --> 01:17:48.830
COLLEAGUES THAT- YOU KNOW WE

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:49.931
PROBABLY NEED TO MOVE A LITTLE

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.500
FASTER OR WE NEED MORE REAL

01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:53.301
TIME DATA AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:56.238
THE COMPLICATIONS OF CREATING A

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:58.040
STATEWIDE DATABASE BUT- IT

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.441
SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S-

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:02.010
PROBABLY A NEED TO. FIGURE OUT

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.812
A PARALLEL PROCESS TO COLLECT

01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:05.414
THAT THEY COLLECT INFORMATION

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.682
SO THAT WE ACTUALLY- UNDERSTAND

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:09.051
THE EFFICACY OF THE FUNDING

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.285
THAT WORD THAT'S BEING ALLOCATE

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.687
ESPECIALLY AS THE AMOUNTS ARE

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.389
GROWING- SIGNIFICANTLY I'M

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:17.392
GOING TO THE COCS- I MEAN IS

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:18.427
THERE DISCUSSION I AM AT MY

01:18:18.493 --> 01:18:19.194
LAST QUESTION IS THERE

01:18:19.261 --> 01:18:26.935
DISCUSSION TO KIND. OF OR HOW

01:18:27.002 --> 01:18:27.803
OFTEN DO YOU. GATHER DATA NOT

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:28.737
BEFORE THIS. FOR THE DATABASE

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:29.905
SYSTEM BUT JUST. TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:29.971 --> 01:18:31.506
IT WHETHER WE'RE AFFECT.

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:37.979
REDUCING HOME. YEAH. THIRTY

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:38.747
THREE YEAH I WAS JUST GOING M.

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.816
AND MANAGE AND YOU CAN IN HERE

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.418
ALLEY AT I THINK THAT IT'S TIME

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:46.488
IT'S ALSO AS WE LOOK AT- THAT

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.889
DATA TO YOUR POINT RIGHT IT'S

01:18:47.956 --> 01:18:50.025
IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:51.059
ACCELERATING AND DOING

01:18:51.126 --> 01:18:52.594
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET THE

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.629
H. E. I. S. SYSTEM IN PLACE AND

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:57.065
OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE IT UP AND

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:59.568
RUNNING BY THE END OF MARCH AND

SO WE'RE WORKING WITH A SENSE

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.437
OF URGENCY ON THAT-

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.307
ADDITIONALLY- IT WITH REGARD TO

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:06.842

NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS A GOOD

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:59.594
HOMELESSNESS- WHICH- IN MANY

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:03.397
INSTANCES- ARE A RESULT OF. THE

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.633
LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.335
MANY CASES IT'S ALSO THE RESULT

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:09.470

THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:48:52.425 --> 01:48:54.895

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:31.910
OF FOLKS WHO DON'T NEED A VERY

02:07:31.977 --> 02:07:33.712
DEEP LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE.

02:07:33.779 --> 02:07:34.980
THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO

02:07:35.047 --> 02:07:37.082
POOR FOR A RENTAL MARKET AND SO

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:37.916
THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM SHALLOW

02:07:37.983 --> 02:07:39.985
SUBSIDY. IS PROVIDE A SMALLER

02:07:40.052 --> 02:07:41.253
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO HOUSEHOLDS

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:42.154

SUPPORTIVE HOUSING I ARE IN OUR

02:07:45.991 --> 02:07:47.559
SYSTEM THAT WE NEED ABOUT NINE

02:07:47.626 --> 02:07:48.060
HUNDRED TWENTY OF THOSE

02:07:48.127 --> 02:07:50.796
ANNUALLY- WE ALSO NEED A MORE

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:51.864
INTENSIVE INTERVENTION FOR SOME

OF OUR SENIORS OAKLAND HAS.

02:07:53.766 --> 02:07:55.634
BEEN EVEN HOMELESS POPULATION

02:07:55.701 --> 02:07:58.303
AND SO WE FOUND THAT WE NEED

02:07:58.370 --> 02:07:58.837
SEVEN HUNDRED SEVEN UNITS

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.072

SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR SENIORS.

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:03.142
THIS WOULD BE A NEW AND MORE

02:08:03.208 --> 02:08:05.310
INTENSIVE INTERVENTION. THAN

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:06.578
TRADITIONAL PERMANENT

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:07.479
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT NOT

BOARDING KERR. HI AND THIS AND

02:08:13.218 --> 02:08:15.788
MOST IMPORTANT KEYS IS THAT WE

ALMOST TWO THOUSAND UNITS IN

02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:21.560
FACT. A DEEPLY AFFORDABLE UNITS

02:08:21.627 --> 02:08:22.828
WITH NO NEED FOR SUPPORT

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.696
SERVICES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF

PEOPLE EXPERT EXPERIENCING

02:08:25.697 --> 02:08:27.032
HOMELESSNESS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:29.835

02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:33.439
THAT THAT REQUIRED THEM TO

02:08:33.505 --> 02:08:35.007
RECEIVE SUPPORT SERVICES.

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.175
THEY'RE JUST TOO POOR FOR THE

02:08:36.241 --> 02:08:38.177
RENT AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE A

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:40.479
DEEPLY AFFORDABLE. HOUSING

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:42.448

AND NOW THIS IS WHAT WE NEED IN

THE STATE- THREE FUNDAMENTAL

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.602
ISSUES ABOUT O'QUINN'S HOMELESS

BUDGET SITUATION THAT I WANT TO

BRING TO THE- TO. YOUR

02:11:53.171 --> 02:11:54.840
ATTENTION. AND I HOPE THE

02:11:54.906 --> 02:11:56.608
ASSEMBLY WHAT WILL KEEP IN MIND

02:11:56.675 --> 02:11:58.477
FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE AS YOU

02:11:58.543 --> 02:11:59.378
BEGIN YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS

02:11:59.444 --> 02:12:01.713
FOR THIS YEAR- FIRST OBVIOUSLY

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:03.949
IS THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE

02:12:04.016 --> 02:12:06.084
AND WHAT OUR DATA DATA ANALYSES

02:12:06.151 --> 02:12:07.586
HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WE NEED-

02:12:07.653 --> 02:12:09.121
OAKLAND'S HOMELESS BUDGET FOR

02:12:09.187 --> 02:12:11.123
FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:12.791
IS JUST UNDER SIXTY TWO MILLION

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:15.260
DOLLARS BUT IMPORTANTLY ROUGHLY

02:12:15.327 --> 02:12:18.363
TWO THIRDS OF THAT IS ONE TIME.

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:19.564
INCLUDING TWENTY MILLION

02:12:19.631 --> 02:12:20.899
DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS IN JUST

02:12:20.966 --> 02:12:22.034
UNDER TWENTY TWO MILLION

02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.802
DOLLARS IN FEDERAL COLLUDED

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:26.338
FINDS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED- WE

02:12:26.405 --> 02:12:27.806
ACTUALLY ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWENTY

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:29.241
TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:31.443
ANNUALLY AND RELIABLE ON GOING

02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:32.811
REVENUE. AND THESE COME FROM

02:12:32.878 --> 02:12:34.279
FEDERAL AND LOCAL GENERAL FUND

02:12:34.346 --> 02:12:36.415
SOURCES I AND SO THAT'S JUST A

02:12:36.481 --> 02:12:38.150
LITTLE OVER ONE FIFTH OF WHAT

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:39.151
ARE NOW SO GAPS IN NEEDS

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:40.218
ANALYSIS HAVE SHOWN IS THAT WE

02:12:40.285 --> 02:12:42.421
NEED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

02:12:42.487 --> 02:12:44.456
FUNCTIONAL ZEROING IN OAKLAND-

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.791
SECOND IS THE FACT THAT THAT

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:47.693
GAP IN TERMS OF THAT THE

02:12:47.759 --> 02:12:48.593
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:49.861
ALL WE NEED IS THAT IS ABOUT TO

ARE YOU FUNDING SET ASIDE. TO

SET ASIDE BEDS AT NAVIGATION

CENTERS BRIDGE HOUSING AND SOME

02:20:57.081 --> 02:21:01.486
PERMANENT. SUPPORTIVE HOUSING

02:21:01.553 --> 02:21:03.454
PROJECTS. ONCE WE HAVE BAD WITH

02:21:03.521 --> 02:21:04.422
THE TO THE TO POPULAR I'M

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:06.024
LOOKING TO. AFTER THE YOUTH

02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:08.092
ASIDE FUNDS SPENT. DUE TO THE

02:21:08.159 --> 02:21:11.095
SMALL ALLOCATION OF. THE YOUTH

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:13.698
SET ASIDE. THERE YOU KNOW IT'S

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:14.999
AN IN A SMALL COMMUNITY LIKE

02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:16.868
PORTER BELLE. I JUST FOR SOME

02:21:16.935 --> 02:21:19.404
PERSPECTIVE THAT 8% IS REALLY

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:21.873
ONLY ABOUT TWENTY NINE THOUSAND

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.041
DOLLARS OF THE ALLOCATION SO

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:24.676
OPENING A NEW PROGRAM SPECIFIC

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:28.146
TO YOUR- JUST ISN'T REALISTIC

02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:28.847
WITH THAT SORT OF ALLOCATION.

02:21:28.913 --> 02:21:30.582
BECAUSE COMPETING PRIORITIES AT

02:21:30.648 --> 02:21:31.649
THE LOCAL LEVEL CAN BE A

02:21:31.716 --> 02:21:33.184
SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO SOLVING

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:34.986
HOMELESSNESS. ONE OF THE KEY

02:21:35.053 --> 02:21:36.321
ROLES THAT THAT THE STATE CAN

02:21:36.387 --> 02:21:38.223
PLAY AS BY CONTINUING SET

02:21:38.289 --> 02:21:40.525
ASIDES. THAT REQUIRED OR

02:21:40.592 --> 02:21:41.092
RESTRICTIONS TO MAKE

02:21:41.159 --> 02:21:43.027
INVESTMENTS THAT OUR- MENTOR AT

02:21:43.094 --> 02:21:44.629
WHAT THE NEEDS ARE GAPS IN

02:21:44.696 --> 02:21:46.197
THEIR LOCAL SYSTEMS. THAT

02:21:46.264 --> 02:21:48.032
PROTECT UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS

02:21:48.099 --> 02:21:49.834
LIKE YOUTH. BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:21:49.901 --> 02:21:51.836
SOMETIMES INVISIBLE COMPARED TO

02:21:51.903 --> 02:21:54.706
OTHER POPULATIONS. AND IT KEEPS

02:21:54.772 --> 02:21:55.240
THEM FROM BEING OVERLOOKED

02:21:55.306 --> 02:21:57.408
ENTIRELY. WHEN IT LOCAL

02:21:57.475 --> 02:21:59.310
JURISDICTIONS ARE REQUIRED TO

02:21:59.377 --> 02:22:01.312
INVEST IN SOLUTION FOR YOU THEY

02:22:01.379 --> 02:22:03.081
BUILD STRONGER SYSTEMS OF CARE.

02:22:03.147 --> 02:22:04.916
UNFORTUNATELY FROM TALKING TO

02:22:04.983 --> 02:22:06.417
SOME OF MY PEERS IN THE FIELD

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:07.018
I'VE HEARD THAT THE YOUTH SET

02:22:07.085 --> 02:22:09.520
ASIDE. WAS AND STILL IS BEING

02:22:09.587 --> 02:22:11.256
VIEWED AS A FUNDING CEILING

02:22:11.322 --> 02:22:13.925
RATHER THAN A FUNDING FLOOR- I

02:22:13.992 --> 02:22:16.561
THINK WITHIN NOT- IN IN

02:22:16.628 --> 02:22:19.063
PROBABLY MOST CONSISTENTLY IN

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:21.399
THE RURAL AREAS- COMMUNITIES

02:22:21.466 --> 02:22:22.634
ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE LESS THAN

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:24.002
A HUNDRED THOUSAND SPREAD OUT

02:22:24.068 --> 02:22:26.604
OVER THREE. TO FIVE EIGHT YEARS

02:22:26.671 --> 02:22:28.940
DEPENDING ON. HOW EFFICIENT

02:22:29.007 --> 02:22:30.975
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE. OF

02:22:31.042 --> 02:22:33.278
GETTING THOSE RESOURCES OUT.

02:22:33.344 --> 02:22:35.313
AND THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ARE

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:37.515
SO VAST IT MAKES IT CHALLENGING

02:22:37.582 --> 02:22:40.818
TO CREATE TAILORED SOLUTIONS

02:22:40.885 --> 02:22:41.719
SPECIFICALLY FOR YOU. HARDS UP

02:22:41.786 --> 02:22:42.353
A PER THAT MEETS THE

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:45.189
DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

02:22:45.256 --> 02:22:45.790
NEEDS OF YOUTH WITHOUT LITTLE

02:22:45.857 --> 02:22:50.161
FUNDING. ON HOME. FOR THE RURAL

02:22:50.228 --> 02:22:52.597
COUNTRYSIDE ACADEMIC. WRAP IT

02:22:52.664 --> 02:22:54.599
UP IN ABOUT A MINUTE IF YOU CAN.

02:22:54.666 --> 02:22:56.634
YES OF COURSE I KNOW HOME HERE-

02:22:56.701 --> 02:22:58.469
THE ALLOCATION WAS ONLY ENOUGH

02:22:58.536 --> 02:23:01.005
TO ACQUIRE. BEING THERE AND

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:03.274
PROPERTIES AND NOT ENOUGH. IT'S

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:04.809
LIKELY THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO

02:23:04.876 --> 02:23:06.177
FINISH THE CONVERSIONS ON

02:23:06.244 --> 02:23:09.147
EITHER OF THE PROPERTY TAX. I'M

02:23:09.213 --> 02:23:10.214
AND THE LAST THING I WANT TO

02:23:10.281 --> 02:23:11.115
LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT IN

02:23:11.182 --> 02:23:12.951
FRESNO COUNTY THEIR THOUSAND

COURTHOUSE. IF THE EVICTION

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.421
MORATORIUM DOESN'T GET

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:19.190
EXTENDED. WE'RE GOING TO FIND A

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:21.225
THAT ALL RELATIONS OF PEOPLE

02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:22.593
ARE AFFECTED BY THOSE

02:23:22.660 --> 02:23:25.830
ADMISSIONS INCLUDING. YOU SO IT

02:23:25.897 --> 02:23:27.332
WOULD DEFINITELY THE STATE

02:23:27.398 --> 02:23:28.533
SHOULD EXTEND ANY LENGTH OF

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:32.637
STAY REQUIREMENTS FOR FOLKS.

02:23:32.704 --> 02:23:33.204

02:26:42.426 --> 02:26:43.628
IMPORTANT PERSPECTIVE FOR US IS

02:26:43.694 --> 02:26:44.428
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE

02:26:44.495 --> 02:26:46.731
BUDGETARY. ISSUES AND CONCERNS

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:47.298
AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:49.600
INVEST AND WHOEVER WANTS TO

02:26:49.667 --> 02:26:51.736
ADDRESS THIS WOULD BE GREAT-

02:26:51.802 --> 02:26:53.070
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE

02:26:53.137 --> 02:26:54.071
THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE YOU

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:55.540
ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN

02:26:55.606 --> 02:26:57.308
COMBATING THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE

02:26:57.375 --> 02:27:00.178
HE PAP HOME HE- SO WHAT I THINK

02:27:00.244 --> 02:27:02.446
IS MOST EFFECTIVE- WHICH WHICH

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:03.481
OF THE PROGRAMS ARE IT MUST

02:27:03.548 --> 02:27:05.016
EASIEST TO NAVIGATE FROM YOUR

02:27:05.082 --> 02:27:06.284
PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF DEALING

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:07.118
WITH RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:08.986
IN OTHER THINGS- AND THEN THE

02:27:09.053 --> 02:27:10.254
LAST QUESTION I HAVE AND I

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:10.922
THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS

02:27:10.988 --> 02:27:11.756
BUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM

02:27:11.822 --> 02:27:13.124
YOU. DO YOU THINK THE FUNDS

02:27:13.191 --> 02:27:17.028
THAT WERE PUTTING FORCE- MATCH

02:27:17.094 --> 02:27:17.795
THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. SO

02:27:17.862 --> 02:27:19.330
SORRY FOR ALL THREE OF THOSE

02:27:19.397 --> 02:27:19.964
ARE THROUGH THIS QUESTIONS THAT

02:27:20.031 --> 02:27:21.832
WOULD JUST LOVE TO GET YOUR

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:22.400
ALSO PERSPECTIVE ON WHOEVER

02:27:22.466 --> 02:27:27.038
WANTS TO TAKE IT. I'M HAPPY TO

02:27:27.104 --> 02:27:28.506
GO PERSON THAT THE L. A.

02:27:28.573 --> 02:27:31.642
PERSPECTIVE. I RIGHT WE GET THE

02:27:31.709 --> 02:27:33.010
RESTRICTIONS THAT CONGRESS

02:27:33.077 --> 02:27:34.579
STATE FUNDING DON'T TEND TO BE

02:27:34.645 --> 02:27:35.846
AS STRINGENT AS WHAT WE SEE

02:27:35.913 --> 02:27:37.181
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:38.416
BACK APPRECIATED THE PERSON

02:27:38.482 --> 02:27:40.084
FLEXIBILITY THERE. WHERE WE

02:27:40.151 --> 02:27:41.886
HAVE SEEN THE MOST VALUE IN

02:27:41.953 --> 02:27:43.254
THOSE DOLLARS IS WITHOUT

02:27:43.321 --> 02:27:44.355
PROBLEM SOLVING RESOURCE THAT I

02:27:44.422 --> 02:27:46.190
MENTIONED SO. WE SEE AN

02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:48.092
INCREASED NEED FOR. I THINK

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:49.627
THAT IS VERY FLEXIBLE AND NON

02:27:49.694 --> 02:27:51.329
RESTRICTIVE AND THINK THAT

02:27:51.395 --> 02:27:54.532
PEOPLE ACT- AND AS A ROOMMATE

02:27:54.599 --> 02:27:56.200
TO GIVE THAT ONE TIME OR SHORT

02:27:56.267 --> 02:27:58.035
TERM INTERVENTIONS THAT. RESULT

02:27:58.102 --> 02:27:59.804
HOMELESSNESS BEFORE PEOPLE

02:27:59.870 --> 02:28:02.340
LANGUISH FOR TOO LONG IN THE

02:28:02.406 --> 02:28:03.774
HOME OF THE SIX DOT ORG. HOUSE

02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:05.343
SO. BRINGING THAT UP WOULD BE

02:28:05.409 --> 02:28:07.011
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND THEN

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:08.079
JUST GOING BACK TO PUT

02:28:08.145 --> 02:28:09.547
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE'VE MADE

02:28:09.614 --> 02:28:11.382
BEFORE OR ON THE- ON GOING

02:28:11.449 --> 02:28:13.050
FUNDING HE FELT. ANYTHING THAT

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:14.485
CAN BE DONE TO CREATE A LEVEL

02:28:14.552 --> 02:28:16.287
OF PREDICTABILITY AND WE'VE

02:28:16.354 --> 02:28:18.022
BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS HERE

02:28:18.089 --> 02:28:19.223
AND ELSEWHERE. ABOUT HOW WE DO

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.759

PROVIDERS AND OUR PARTNERS.

02:28:24.929 --> 02:28:25.596
SOME PEOPLE WOULD EVEN

02:28:25.663 --> 02:28:27.698
PERFORMANCE SPEED DECREASE

02:28:27.765 --> 02:28:29.934
BUDGET. PREDICTABLE BUT AT-

02:28:30.001 --> 02:28:31.869
THAT WE COULD THEN BUILD ON OUR

02:28:31.936 --> 02:28:34.372
ON DEMAND- INCREASE OVER TIME.

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:35.539
BUT THE WAR THAT WE CAN PLAN

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.508
AND BOOK THE- MORE THAT WE CAN

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:39.977
GET AWAY. FROM HAVING TO RAMP

02:28:40.044 --> 02:28:41.312

02:43:49.019 --> 02:43:50.387
BIT LARGER THAN THE PIT COUNT

02:43:50.453 --> 02:43:51.788
BECAUSE IT IS AN ANNUAL

02:43:51.855 --> 02:43:53.256
ESTIMATE OF UNIQUE PEOPLE AND

02:43:53.323 --> 02:43:56.726

ROLE. IN RESPONDING TO

02:44:15.245 --> 02:44:17.547
HOMELESSNESS. I WANT TO START

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:19.049
BY TALKING ABOUT ARGUABLY THE

02:44:19.115 --> 02:44:20.150
MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE

02:44:20.217 --> 02:44:21.351
SPECIFICALLY UNSHELTERED

02:44:21.418 --> 02:44:23.019
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING

02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:24.888
FROM SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:26.356
RECENT YEARS LOS ANGELES HAS

02:44:26.423 --> 02:44:28.191
GREATLY EXPANDED OF STREET

02:44:28.258 --> 02:44:30.260
OUTREACH SERVICES. AND IN A

02:44:30.327 --> 02:44:32.295
RECENT YEARS RETIREES WORKERS

02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:35.131
WERE IN CONTACT WITH JUST UNDER

02:44:35.198 --> 02:44:35.599
THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

02:44:35.665 --> 02:44:37.767
INDIVIDUALS. WE WENT TO THE

02:44:37.834 --> 02:44:40.070
STREET ARE REACHED RECORDS TO

02:44:40.136 --> 02:44:42.138
CLINICAL DATA PROVIDED BY THE

02:44:42.205 --> 02:44:42.706
L. A. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF

02:44:42.772 --> 02:44:45.242
MENTAL HEALTH. AND FOUND THAT

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:47.377
20% OF SRIDHAR REACH CLIENTS

02:44:47.444 --> 02:44:49.045
HAVE A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS THIS

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:51.481
YEAR IS MENTAL ILLNESS BY THE

02:44:51.548 --> 02:44:52.449
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH.

02:44:52.515 --> 02:44:54.117
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FINDING

02:44:54.184 --> 02:44:55.285
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT RELY ON

02:44:55.352 --> 02:44:56.853
SURVEYS OR SELF REPORTED

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:58.288
INFORMATION WHICH CAN BE VERY

02:44:58.355 --> 02:45:00.290
DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN ESPECIALLY

02:45:00.357 --> 02:45:01.992
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY WELL.

02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:03.860
ALSO 20% IS A CONSERVATIVE

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:05.595
ESTIMATE AS MANY AS THREE HOURS

02:45:05.662 --> 02:45:07.430
CLIENTS MIGHT BE UNDIAGNOSED OR

02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:08.565
COULD HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED BY

02:45:08.632 --> 02:45:10.567
ANY AGENCY OTHER THAN THE OUR

02:45:10.634 --> 02:45:12.569
MENTAL HEALTH. WHY IS THIS

02:45:12.636 --> 02:45:14.571
IMPORTANT. WE ALL KNOW THAT WE

02:45:14.638 --> 02:45:16.172
NEED INVESTMENTS IN HOUSING AND

02:45:16.239 --> 02:45:17.874
HOUSING SUBSIDIES TO SOLVE

02:45:17.941 --> 02:45:20.043
HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:21.177
WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT SOME OF

02:45:21.244 --> 02:45:22.412
THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS

02:45:22.479 --> 02:45:23.613
MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ALSO

02:45:23.680 --> 02:45:25.215
SUFFERING FROM SEVERE

02:45:25.282 --> 02:45:26.783
CONDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN

02:45:26.850 --> 02:45:28.218
HOUSING ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR

02:45:28.285 --> 02:45:30.186
THEM THEY WILL NEED ACCESS TO

02:45:30.253 --> 02:45:31.388
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES

02:45:31.454 --> 02:45:33.923
SOMETIMES CALLED BOARDING CARE.

02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:35.458
UNLIKE MOST SHELTER STAFF THE

02:45:35.525 --> 02:45:36.693
RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES CAN

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:38.328
ADMINISTER MEDICATION AND

02:45:38.395 --> 02:45:41.431
MONITOR AND HANDLE BASIC NEEDS

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:42.265

EITHER CRUCIAL RESOURCES THEY

02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:45.035
ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

02:45:45.101 --> 02:45:46.603
ENCAMPMENTS AND THE MOST SICK

02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:48.138
THESE FUNCTIONAL INDIVIDUALS

02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:50.173
LIVING ON OUR STREETS. YES THEY

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:52.776
ARE CLOSING DUE TO FUNDING GAPS

02:45:52.842 --> 02:45:54.311
IN A LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

02:45:54.377 --> 02:45:55.645
THE STATE COULD PLAY A CRITICAL

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:57.314
ROLE IN SHORING UP OPERATING

02:45:57.380 --> 02:45:58.982

02:47:25.335 --> 02:47:27.704
CONSIDER STABLE FUNDING.

02:47:27.771 --> 02:47:29.939
FUNDING SOURCES FOR SERVICES.

02:47:30.006 --> 02:47:32.475
AND CLEARLY WE HAVE TO SUPPORT

02:47:32.542 --> 02:47:33.910
THE INVESTIGATION AND

02:47:33.977 --> 02:47:36.246
ENFORCEMENT AGAINST

DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING

02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:39.749
PRACTICES. FINALLY I WANT TO

02:47:39.816 --> 02:47:41.284
END BY TALKING ABOUT SINGLE

02:47:41.351 --> 02:47:42.519
ADULTS WERE FALLING INTO

02:47:42.585 --> 02:47:43.052
HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST

02:47:43.119 --> 02:47:45.655
TIME. I STARTED TALKING ABOUT

02:47:45.722 --> 02:47:47.290
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS WITH A

02:47:47.357 --> 02:47:49.192
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS BUT IT'S

02:47:49.259 --> 02:47:51.227
ALSO TRUE THAT 50% OF SINGLE

SERVICE HISTORY WITH THE

02:47:57.333 --> 02:47:59.035
COUNTY. THAT MEANS THEY HAVE

02:47:59.102 --> 02:48:00.437
NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH A

02:48:00.503 --> 02:48:02.138

SINGLE ADULT DO YOU SERVICE.

02:48:25.862 --> 02:48:27.096
OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT L. A.

02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:28.598
COUNTY AND CITY COULD

02:48:28.665 --> 02:48:30.066
POTENTIALLY PREVENT THESE

02:48:30.133 --> 02:48:31.734
INFLOWS BEFORE THEY OCCUR. AND

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:33.603
COLLECTION LHASA WE ARE

02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:35.338
DEVELOPING A PURELY VALID

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:36.673
SURVEY THAT CAN BE USED IN THE

02:48:36.739 --> 02:48:38.107
FIELD TO SCREEN PEOPLE SEEKING

02:48:38.174 --> 02:48:40.176
PREVENTION WHICH IS TYPICALLY A

02:48:40.243 --> 02:48:41.711
ONE TIME CASH ASSISTANCE. WE'VE

02:48:41.778 --> 02:48:43.246
ALSO DEVELOPED PREDICTIVE

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:45.281

POLICY THAT ARE IMPLEMENTING

02:48:49.185 --> 02:48:53.289
AND PREVENTION PILOT. LED BY

02:48:53.356 --> 02:48:53.790
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:48:54.591 --> 02:48:56.125
PEOPLE OF UNITS. HOUSING AND

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:57.227
CERTAINLY BEFORE THEY'RE ON THE

02:48:57.293 --> 02:48:58.895
STREET WHERE THEY ARE HIGH RISK

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:00.830
OF DEVELOPING PHYSICAL AND

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:03.066
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. I'VE

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.400
GIVEN THREE DATA POINTS TODAY

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.202
THAT IF YOU'RE DISCONNECTED AND

02:49:06.269 --> 02:49:07.370
I'M RELATED TO EACH OTHER BUT

02:49:07.437 --> 02:49:08.938
THEY ARE NOT THEY REFLECT THE

02:49:09.005 --> 02:49:10.240
DIVERSITY AMONG THE HOMELESS

02:49:10.306 --> 02:49:12.342
POPULATION AND THE NEED TO FIND

02:49:12.408 --> 02:49:14.410
A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS. WE

02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.979
HAVE TO RESIST CHARACTERIZING

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:17.347
THE HOMELESS CRISIS AS ONLY

02:49:17.413 --> 02:49:19.115

ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

02:49:21.384 --> 02:49:21.951
ARE ONLY ABOUT POVERTY AND

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:24.120
UNEMPLOYMENT. THE DATA DOES NOT

02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:26.756
SUPPORT SUCH AN HEARING HERE.

02:49:26.823 --> 02:49:29.459
WE NEED A HARD RANGE. OF

02:49:29.526 --> 02:49:32.495
SOLUTIONS. AND THE COURAGE AND

02:49:32.562 --> 02:49:34.664
IMAGINATION TO PURSUE THEM. OUR

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:36.132
RESEARCH ALSO CONSISTENTLY

02:49:36.199 --> 02:49:37.467
SHOWS THE NEED TO INVEST IN

02:49:37.534 --> 02:49:40.036
SERVICES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS

02:49:40.103 --> 02:49:41.604
IN ADDITION TO HOUSING. I DID

02:49:41.671 --> 02:49:42.972

CATCHERS- AND YOU KNOW CLEARLY

02:50:46.569 --> 02:50:48.738
THERE IS AN OVERWHELMING. ISSUE

02:50:48.805 --> 02:50:50.039
OF DEMAND AND THERE'S A

02:50:50.106 --> 02:50:51.608
OVERWHELMING NEED TO DEVELOP

02:50:51.674 --> 02:50:54.510
CAPACITY BUT- HOW WE DO THAT IS

02:50:54.577 --> 02:50:57.347
CRITICAL AND IT MUST BE DRIVEN.

02:50:57.413 --> 02:50:59.382
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- AT THE

02:50:59.449 --> 02:51:00.550
GROUND LEVEL FROM THE GROUND

02:51:00.617 --> 02:51:02.819
UP- AND WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARD

02:51:02.885 --> 02:51:05.555
DESIRED OUTCOMES. ALWAYS BUT

02:51:05.622 --> 02:51:07.256
WHEN WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND I.

02:51:07.323 --> 02:51:09.058
I YOU KNOW I'M I'M HAPPY TO BE

FOLLOWING DR ROWNTREE WE HAVE

02:51:11.527 --> 02:51:13.062
TO ASK OURSELVES I THINK IN A

02:51:13.129 --> 02:51:14.697
SOPHISTICATED WAY WHETHER WE-

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:17.300
COMBAT. I'M IT HOMELESSNESS IS

02:51:17.367 --> 02:51:19.435
NOT ONE THING- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

02:51:19.502 --> 02:51:21.137
A TICKET COUNTER. AND THE PECAN

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:23.973
IS- IN MY OPINION A VERY DAHLE.

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:27.076
BLUNT TOOL- IT DOESN'T EVEN

02:51:27.143 --> 02:51:27.710
ADDRESS THINGS LIKE FOR EXAMPLE

02:51:27.777 --> 02:51:29.445
RECIDIVISM ARE PEOPLE FALLING

02:51:29.512 --> 02:51:30.680
IN AND OUT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE

02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:34.283
LOSING THAT BATTLE OF. INVERSES

02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:36.486
OUT BUT ARE THEY RECIDIVISTS-

02:51:36.552 --> 02:51:37.687
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

02:51:37.754 --> 02:51:38.421
EARLIER THAT I THINK ARE REALLY

02:51:38.488 --> 02:51:40.189
IMPORTANT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:44.027
ASKING ABOUT GAP ANALYSIS- AND

02:51:44.093 --> 02:51:50.133
YOU KNOW IT AND. I'M WORKING

02:51:50.199 --> 02:51:51.567
CAREFULLY WITH THE A CALIFORNIA

02:51:51.634 --> 02:51:52.735
POLICY LED TO DRESS THESE

02:51:52.802 --> 02:51:55.571
ISSUES- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

02:51:55.638 --> 02:51:57.774
RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE FALL INTO

02:51:57.840 --> 02:51:58.841
HOMELESSNESS FOR A VARIETY OF

02:51:58.908 --> 02:52:00.777
REASONS I'M VERY BIASED I FOCUS

02:52:00.843 --> 02:52:01.744
ON THOSE WHO FALL INTO

02:52:01.811 --> 02:52:03.746
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE- OF THEIR

02:52:03.813 --> 02:52:06.149
CONDITION. AND WHAT I'LL SAY

02:52:06.215 --> 02:52:07.950
ABOUT THAT IS IT IS NOT. THE

02:52:08.017 --> 02:52:10.153
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IT SAID BUT

02:52:10.219 --> 02:52:11.688
IT IS A GROUP THAT NEEDS VERY

02:52:11.754 --> 02:52:13.756
VERY FOCUSED EFFORT AND

02:52:13.823 --> 02:52:15.892
FLEXIBLE I'M GOING FUNDS BEYOND

02:52:15.958 --> 02:52:17.627
WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AND WE

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:18.761
HAVE TO THINK IN A

02:52:18.828 --> 02:52:21.164
COMPLIMENTARY FASHION. AMONGST

02:52:21.230 --> 02:52:23.566
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS ABOUT HOW

02:52:23.633 --> 02:52:25.535
WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR THE

02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:26.469
COLLECTED NEEDS TO BE

02:52:26.536 --> 02:52:28.304
COORDINATED VERY VERY WELL I

02:52:28.371 --> 02:52:29.706
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT'S THE

02:52:29.772 --> 02:52:32.408
FUNDAMENTAL PRIORITY FOR LASSA.

02:52:32.475 --> 02:52:34.777
I'M AND THE LOCAL REALITY HERE

02:52:34.844 --> 02:52:36.713
IS THAT IT'S GETTING WORSE. I'M

02:52:36.779 --> 02:52:38.448
WE HAVE DEVELOPED OF A SPECIFIC

02:52:38.514 --> 02:52:40.249
TEAM THE WHOLE THE HOME TEAM

02:52:40.316 --> 02:52:43.453
WHICH FOCUSES ON THE SEVERE

02:52:43.519 --> 02:52:46.522
PERSISTENT. NOW ILL. I'M AND

02:52:46.589 --> 02:52:47.890
I'M TRYING TO GET THE NOT ONLY

02:52:47.957 --> 02:52:49.425
DOING THOSE. WHO ARE SO

02:52:49.492 --> 02:52:51.527
DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE BUT ALSO TO

02:52:51.594 --> 02:52:52.862
HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT'S OUT

02:52:52.929 --> 02:52:55.164
THERE. IN COLLABORATION WITH-

02:52:55.231 --> 02:52:58.034
THE POLICY LAB. AND I WILL SAY

02:52:58.101 --> 02:52:59.569
THAT HERE'S PEOPLE WITH LIVED

02:52:59.635 --> 02:53:01.504
EXPERIENCE ARE A HUGE PART OF

02:53:01.571 --> 02:53:03.706
THAT EFFORT AND NEED TO BE. I'M

02:53:03.773 --> 02:53:05.441
GOING. WITH RESPECT TO

02:53:05.508 --> 02:53:07.176
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED. THIS

02:53:07.243 --> 02:53:08.845
IS A CONTROVERSIAL THING BUT I

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:10.813
AM A STRONG BELIEVER BECAUSE

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.115
PEOPLE FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS

02:53:12.181 --> 02:53:13.883
FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND DUE TO

02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:16.252
THE TRAUMA DEVELOP. MENTAL

02:53:16.319 --> 02:53:17.253
ILLNESS TO BECOME MY CUSTOMER

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:18.955
THAT WE NEED TO GET PEOPLE OFF

02:53:19.021 --> 02:53:20.990
THE STREET. AND THERE I WOULD

02:53:21.057 --> 02:53:22.358
SAY TO YOU THAT IT'S NOT JUST

02:53:22.425 --> 02:53:24.327
ABOUT HOUSING OR SHELTER IT'S

02:53:24.393 --> 02:53:25.795
ABOUT COMMUNITY WHEN YOU LOOK

02:53:25.862 --> 02:53:27.296
AT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE

02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:28.297
MILITARY WHEN WE DEPLOY.

02:53:28.364 --> 02:53:30.233
HUNDREDS THOUSANDS OF MILITARY

02:53:30.299 --> 02:53:32.568
MEMBERS ARE PUT INTO DIGNIFIED

02:53:32.635 --> 02:53:35.738
WELL RESOURCE COMMUNITIES.

02:53:35.805 --> 02:53:37.640
DON'T WAKE. AND HAVE THE ARE.

02:53:37.707 --> 02:53:39.075
WITH PROPERTIES LOS ANGELES

02:53:39.142 --> 02:53:40.977
COUNTY IN MY OPINION TO TAKE

02:53:41.043 --> 02:53:42.178
THAT APPROACH AND BRING PEOPLE

02:53:42.245 --> 02:53:44.947
FROM TRAUMATIZING ENVIRONMENTS

02:53:45.014 --> 02:53:48.151
TO COMMUNITY EVEN IF IT'S- IN.

02:53:48.217 --> 02:53:52.221
COMMUNITY I WILL ALSO SAY THAT-

02:53:52.288 --> 02:53:53.523
ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE

02:53:53.589 --> 02:53:55.391
ARE FUNDING YES PERMANENT

02:53:55.458 --> 02:53:56.392
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS GREAT AND

02:53:56.459 --> 02:53:58.227
THERE'S TONS OF DATA TO SUGGEST

02:53:58.294 --> 02:54:00.096
THAT IT IS. THE SOLUTION FOR

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:01.831
DECADES BEHIND IT'S GOING TO

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:05.168
TAKE DECADES TO GET CAPACITY.

02:54:05.234 --> 02:54:06.502
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF EXISTING

02:54:06.569 --> 02:54:08.337
INFRASTRUCTURE SO WHEN IT COMES

02:54:08.404 --> 02:54:09.639
TO BRING CALIFORNIA HOME NO

PLACE LIKE HOME MONEY AND I'VE

02:54:11.641 --> 02:54:13.042
HAD MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:14.277
ABOUT NO PLACE LIKE HOME WITH

02:54:14.343 --> 02:54:19.348
ALL STEINBERG- OFF AUTHORED AT.

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:20.983
ANY TO SAY ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:54:21.050 --> 02:54:23.352
THAT FUNDING AUDIT NOT JUST BE.

02:54:23.419 --> 02:54:26.222
USED FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND

02:54:26.289 --> 02:54:27.156
FOR NEW PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

02:54:27.223 --> 02:54:28.591
HOUSING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:54:28.658 --> 02:54:30.660
SUCH AS BOARDING CARE NEEDS TO

02:54:30.726 --> 02:54:32.929
NOT ONLY BE SAVED BUT EXPANDED

02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:34.797
IN THAT BUSINESS MODEL MUST BE

02:54:34.864 --> 02:54:37.633
FIXED. AND IT NEEDS ACCESS TO

02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:39.836
ADDITIONAL STREAMS OF MONEY AND

02:54:39.902 --> 02:54:40.770
I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING

02:54:40.837 --> 02:54:43.105

FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING

02:54:46.542 --> 02:54:47.844
LIBERATED I BELIEVE AS WE

02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:49.378
DEVELOP NEW MODELS FOR HOW WE

02:54:49.445 --> 02:54:51.380
CONDUCT. OUR BUSINESS ARE THE

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.649

CONSIDER HOW TO USE IT AS-

02:54:58.788 --> 02:55:00.556
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

02:55:00.623 --> 02:55:03.226
EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE IS KEY

02:55:03.292 --> 02:55:05.628
AND THEN LASTLY I WILL SAY THAT

02:55:05.695 --> 02:55:06.996

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DISPARATE

02:58:36.105 --> 02:58:37.773

ON TALK ABOUT OF THE DRAW-

02:59:21.317 --> 02:59:24.220
INSTANCE OF THE HOW. FAR PEOPLE

02:59:24.286 --> 02:59:25.554
END UP BEING AT HIGHER RISK OF

02:59:25.621 --> 02:59:33.295
AND THE FIRST PLACE. THANK YOU

IN THE YOU MAKE A PLAY. ABOUT

02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:39.401
WHAT'S IN THE- PAY. THERE ARE A

02:59:39.468 --> 02:59:41.203
NUMBER OF BLACK PEOPLE WHO.

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:43.873
PROPERTY IN. WHO WOULD BE HAPPY

02:59:43.939 --> 02:59:47.743

02:59:50.646 --> 02:59:52.348
PEOPLE IN PEOPLE OF COLOR VOTE

02:59:52.414 --> 02:59:55.851
NEED. OFTEN TO THOSE NEED THE

02:59:55.918 --> 02:59:57.820
AND THEY- AND I IMPRESSED.

02:59:57.887 --> 03:00:01.657
INVEST IN ORDER TO. BE TO HIGH.

03:00:01.724 --> 03:00:03.893
AND TO GET. AND BE A PART OF

03:00:03.959 --> 03:00:05.194
THE CITY THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS

03:00:05.261 --> 03:00:07.563
PAY. ON TIME AND SO THOSE ARE

03:00:07.630 --> 03:00:09.331
THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS THAT

03:00:09.398 --> 03:00:11.267
WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THAT

03:00:11.333 --> 03:00:12.968
MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN WHO IS

03:00:13.035 --> 03:00:15.471
SHELTERING AND SERVING. WHEN IT

03:00:15.538 --> 03:00:16.939
GETS TO THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES

03:00:17.006 --> 03:00:19.341
IT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE THAT

03:00:19.408 --> 03:00:21.377
THERE IS DISPARITY OF

03:00:21.443 --> 03:00:23.012
INVESTMENT IN A BLACK

03:00:23.078 --> 03:00:25.047
COMMUNITIES AND THAT DOES

03:00:25.114 --> 03:00:27.816
IMPACT. STRUCTURES IN NON

03:00:27.883 --> 03:00:33.756
PROFITS AND AGENCIES. THAT ARE

03:00:33.822 --> 03:00:35.691
ON THE- FRONTLINE OF. TO THE

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:37.793
NEED OF BLACK PEOPLE. AND IF WE

03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:40.196
DON'T BASS. AT COULD IN THOSE

03:00:40.262 --> 03:00:42.097
AND IN THOSE AGENCIES YOU WILL

03:00:42.164 --> 03:00:44.066
NOT HAVE THE FOLKS WHO ARE

03:00:44.133 --> 03:00:47.069
CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM WITH A

03:00:47.136 --> 03:00:48.771
CULTURAL LANDS I'LL BE

03:00:48.837 --> 03:00:51.240
AVAILABLE TO SERVE WE REALLY

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:53.008
MUST CHANGE SOME OF THE

03:00:53.075 --> 03:00:54.510
STRUCTURES IN THE WAYS THAT

03:00:54.577 --> 03:00:56.979
MONIES ARE ACCESSED AND I THINK

03:00:57.046 --> 03:00:58.581
IT ALSO SPEAKS TO THE DECISION

03:00:58.647 --> 03:01:01.116
MAKER. WE NEED BLACK AND BROWN

03:01:01.183 --> 03:01:03.752
PEOPLE AT THE TABLE NOT JUST

03:01:03.819 --> 03:01:06.188
REPRESENTING AN AREA ARE BEING

03:01:06.255 --> 03:01:07.957
AT FILLING A SEAT BUT HAVING

03:01:08.023 --> 03:01:10.726
DECISION MAKING POWER AND

03:01:10.793 --> 03:01:12.628
AUTHORITY AND WE NEED TO SEE

03:01:12.695 --> 03:01:13.862
THAT ACROSS BOARDS IN THE

03:01:13.929 --> 03:01:15.764
NONPROFIT SECTOR AND AT THE

03:01:15.831 --> 03:01:17.700
HIGHEST LEVELS OF AGENCIES THAT

03:01:17.766 --> 03:01:20.769
MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHERE

03:01:20.836 --> 03:01:22.938
RESOURCES WILL BE INVESTED AND

03:01:23.005 --> 03:01:24.373
THAT ALSO MEANS WE NEED TO BE

03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:25.207
HIRING PEOPLE WITH LIVED

03:01:25.274 --> 03:01:27.910
EXPERIENCE. PROVIDING TRAINING

03:01:27.977 --> 03:01:30.112
AND HAVE ONGOING INVESTMENT IN

03:01:30.179 --> 03:01:32.014
SUPPORT SO THOSE ARE SOME OF

03:01:32.081 --> 03:01:33.449
THE THINGS AND NOT TO MENTION

03:01:33.515 --> 03:01:35.351
THE OVER REPRESENTATION OF

03:01:35.417 --> 03:01:37.319
BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:01:37.386 --> 03:01:39.488
INCARCERATED YOUNG KIDS WERE

03:01:39.555 --> 03:01:40.689
NOT GETTING ADEQUATE

03:01:40.756 --> 03:01:42.258
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND

03:01:42.324 --> 03:01:44.326
WE'RE GOING TO SEE A GREATER

03:01:44.393 --> 03:01:45.694
GAP WE KNOW DO Và C. AND

03:01:45.761 --> 03:01:47.096
SOME OF THOSE INVEST THAT WE

03:01:47.162 --> 03:01:49.265
NEED TO MAKE UPSTREAM THE OVER

03:01:49.331 --> 03:01:50.933
REPRESENTATION OF BLACK KIDS

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.202
ARE IN FOSTER CARE THEN FALLING

03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:54.770
INTO HOMELESSNESS ONCE THE

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:56.839
EMANCIPATE AND YOU CAN SEE THE

03:01:56.905 --> 03:02:00.075
TRAJECTORY ON AND ON- OVER THE

03:02:00.142 --> 03:02:01.910
YEARS THAT THAT STARTS TO

03:02:01.977 --> 03:02:04.413
CREATE THAT TERRIBLE GAP- THAT

03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:06.215
KEEPS BLACK PEOPLE FROM BEING

03:02:06.282 --> 03:02:13.489
ABLE TO COMPETE. AND HAVING.

03:02:13.555 --> 03:02:15.224
EQUAL ACCESS TO RESOURCES IF

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:17.593
I'M THIS THIS IS- JOHN I AYE

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.828
WHY IT YOU KNOW ECHOED SOME OF

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:24.733
THESE HIS POOR I THINK THERE.

03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:27.636
TO WAY WE- IS CRITICAL AND THE

03:02:27.703 --> 03:02:29.438
VOICE. IS CRITICAL THE WAY WE

03:02:29.505 --> 03:02:30.639
LEVERAGE PEOPLE OF THE NEXT I

03:02:30.706 --> 03:02:32.241
SAW BEFORE. IS A HUGE. PART OF

03:02:32.308 --> 03:02:33.008
THE SO BUT ONE OF THE THAT I

THE STREETS STILL BE HOMELESS

BECAUSE THEY'RE IN AN INTERIM

03:08:01.703 --> 03:08:03.939

THERE ARE SOMETIMES BARRIERS TO

03:14:04.132 --> 03:14:05.934
FULLY UTILIZING RESOURCES WE

03:14:06.001 --> 03:14:07.569
USE A BLEND OF FUNDING MODEL

03:14:07.635 --> 03:14:08.970

SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE. BUT I

03:14:18.680 --> 03:14:21.583
THINK WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE AWAY

03:14:21.649 --> 03:14:26.021
FROM THIS- APPROACH OF A BINARY.

03:14:26.087 --> 03:14:27.822
WAY OF LOOKING AT HOMELESSNESS

03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:29.624

03:14:29.691 --> 03:14:31.092
WE CAN SAY WE JUST NEED

LOTS BUSINESSES WAREHOUSES AND

03:14:53.481 --> 03:14:55.617
I THINK WE JUST. HAVE TO MOVE

03:14:55.683 --> 03:14:57.318
FORWARD IN USING THOSE UNDER

03:14:57.385 --> 03:14:59.587
UTILIZED SPACES FOR THE GOOD

03:14:59.654 --> 03:15:01.022

I THINK THAT'S IN THE- OF WHAT

03:20:04.392 --> 03:20:06.160
WORK TO BRING DOWN SO BUT IT

03:20:06.227 --> 03:20:07.462
DOES NEEDS TO BE SCALED AND

03:20:07.528 --> 03:20:09.097
DATA THE YOU'RE ON. WOULD MAKE

03:20:09.163 --> 03:20:09.897

PRE A LOT OF IT GETS BACK TO

03:20:16.971 --> 03:20:17.505
THE FUN QUESTION OF WHAT WE

03:20:17.572 --> 03:20:19.073
CALL. AND ARE WE TRY. WELL YOU

03:20:19.140 --> 03:20:19.707
KNOW WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE AND

03:20:19.774 --> 03:20:20.975
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A GOOD

03:20:21.042 --> 03:20:22.210
GRIP ON IT AND I WOULD SUGGEST

03:20:22.276 --> 03:20:23.378
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER STATES

03:20:23.444 --> 03:20:25.646
DO- OR OR OTHER JURISDICTIONS

03:20:25.713 --> 03:20:26.814
BEYOND THE PIC COUNT BUT I

03:20:26.881 --> 03:20:28.483
MEAN. I TRUE COUNTIES IN

03:20:28.549 --> 03:20:29.884
ONGOING COUNTER IN THE STREETS

03:20:29.951 --> 03:20:31.219
ALL DAY LONG WHY ARE WE NOT

03:20:31.285 --> 03:20:32.520
FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT

03:20:32.587 --> 03:20:34.088
THERE AND THEN FIGURING OUT

03:20:34.155 --> 03:20:35.456
WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT AND

03:20:35.523 --> 03:20:36.557
THAT'S NOT A SIDE ROAD SYSTEM

03:20:36.624 --> 03:20:37.558
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE WHEN I

03:20:37.625 --> 03:20:39.460
GOT HERE. MY TEAMS THE MENTAL

03:20:39.527 --> 03:20:40.661
HEALTH TEAMS WERE DOING THE

03:20:40.728 --> 03:20:42.296
SAME WORK AS THE REST OF THE OF

03:20:42.363 --> 03:20:43.731
THAT THE GENERAL OUTREACH TEAMS

03:20:43.798 --> 03:20:45.466
AND I SAID NO. WE NEED TO TAKE

03:20:45.533 --> 03:20:47.402
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO

03:20:47.468 --> 03:20:49.504
ARE THE MOST PROFOUNDLY ILL AND

03:20:49.570 --> 03:20:50.671
WE COME ACROSS PEOPLE THAT WE

03:20:50.738 --> 03:20:52.473
CAN REFER TO THE GENERALIST IN

03:20:52.540 --> 03:20:53.674
THE GENERAL WAS CONFINED PEOPLE

03:20:53.741 --> 03:20:54.976
WITH SERIOUS ISSUES. AND THEY

03:20:55.042 --> 03:20:56.411
CAN REFER THEM TO US SO IT'S A

03:20:56.477 --> 03:20:58.179
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BUT IT'S

03:20:58.246 --> 03:20:59.614
ABOUT SAYING WHO'S TAKING

03:20:59.680 --> 03:21:01.482
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT AND

03:21:01.549 --> 03:21:03.050
THEN BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE

03:21:03.117 --> 03:21:04.652
GETTING THE TEAMS TO WORK

03:21:04.719 --> 03:21:05.753
TOGETHER BUT IN ORDER TO DO

03:21:05.820 --> 03:21:07.188
THAT WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE

03:21:07.255 --> 03:21:09.424
GOING AFTER. AND I WOULD

03:21:09.490 --> 03:21:10.458
SUGGEST THE STATE REALLY

03:21:10.525 --> 03:21:14.028
CONSIDER WHAT IS CALIFORNIA'S

03:21:14.095 --> 03:21:15.329
APPROACH TO THE PIT COUNT

03:21:15.396 --> 03:21:16.330
BECAUSE IT OUGHT TO BE AN

03:21:16.397 --> 03:21:18.833
ONGOING EFFORT THAT WE'RE WE

03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:20.735
EVEN THIS DESPITE OUR SIZE.

03:21:20.802 --> 03:21:22.236
WHERE WE WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE

03:21:22.303 --> 03:21:24.338
A REGISTRY AND THAT WE KNOW

03:21:24.405 --> 03:21:26.407
WHAT'S OUT THERE AND WE DERIVE

03:21:26.474 --> 03:21:27.508
THE SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF THE

03:21:27.575 --> 03:21:29.210
PROGRAM TYPES AND ALSO THE

03:21:29.277 --> 03:21:33.948
LEVEL. OF FUNDING. THERE WILL

03:21:34.015 --> 03:21:36.417
BE REQUIRED. THANK YOU FOR THAT

BUT I DO WANT TO AT LEAST HAVE

03:22:03.110 --> 03:22:04.479
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A

03:22:04.545 --> 03:22:07.315
GALLON BECAUSE I DO THINK AS WE

03:22:07.381 --> 03:22:11.986
TALK ABOUT ISSUES OR THINGS

03:22:12.053 --> 03:22:13.287
THAT WE'D LIKE TO. IN ESSENCE

03:22:13.354 --> 03:22:15.122
GETS. WE ALSO SHOULD HAVE THE

03:22:15.189 --> 03:22:17.391
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WHEN

03:22:17.458 --> 03:22:19.393
THINGS ARE DONE WHILE. A NEW-

03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:21.829
MODEL IN ORANGE COUNTY IT'S

03:22:21.896 --> 03:22:22.697
CALLED THE ORANGE COUNTY BE

03:22:22.763 --> 03:22:24.499
WELL. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE

03:22:24.565 --> 03:22:26.434
HEARD IT ABOUT IT. BUT IT'S

03:22:26.501 --> 03:22:28.836
ACTUALLY A COALITION OF ABOUT

03:22:28.903 --> 03:22:29.770
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY.

03:22:29.837 --> 03:22:31.506
ORGANIZATIONS BELIEVE IT OR NOT

03:22:31.572 --> 03:22:33.040
THAT MANY BECAUSE THERE'S MANY

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:35.042
MANY PROVIDERS OUT THERE SMALL

03:22:35.109 --> 03:22:37.545
LARGE. BUT THIS COALITION ALSO

03:22:37.612 --> 03:22:39.313
INCLUDES HOSPITALS WHICH I

03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:41.782
THINK IS ONE OF THE UNIQUE.

03:22:41.849 --> 03:22:44.652
ELEMENTS AND- THE HOSPITALS IN

03:22:44.719 --> 03:22:46.988
ORANGE COUNTY A MANY OF THEM

03:22:47.054 --> 03:22:50.057
PRIVATE- BUT INCLUDING. AND

03:22:50.124 --> 03:22:52.360
HOLDEN ST JUDE ST JOSEPH HAVE

HOUSING PARTNERS. AND HAVE JUST

03:22:57.632 --> 03:22:59.200

COUNTY. AND WHAT IT IS AN

03:23:04.105 --> 03:23:06.140
ATTEMPT TO DIVERT. UP MANY

03:23:06.207 --> 03:23:08.976
TIMES THE PATIENTS THAT WE SEE

03:23:09.043 --> 03:23:10.912
EITHER BEING ADMITTED TO

03:23:10.978 --> 03:23:13.147
EMERGENCY ROOMS OR TO OUR

03:23:13.214 --> 03:23:15.449
JAILS. FOR MENTAL HEALTH

03:23:15.516 --> 03:23:19.053
ISSUES. WE KNOW THAT- BECAUSE

03:23:19.120 --> 03:23:20.054
WE DON'T HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE

03:23:20.121 --> 03:23:22.456
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN PLACE

03:23:22.523 --> 03:23:24.525
TO TAKE PEOPLE THAT TYPICALLY

03:23:24.592 --> 03:23:28.563
IT'S EMERGENCY ROOMS. OR JAILS

03:23:28.629 --> 03:23:31.499
SO THIS NEW CENTER THAT JUST

03:23:31.566 --> 03:23:33.634
OPENED LAST WEEK IN ORANGE

03:23:33.701 --> 03:23:37.438
COUNTY WILL BE A NINETY DAY. I

03:23:37.505 --> 03:23:39.907
AM. HOW FOR MENTAL HEALTH WHERE

03:23:39.974 --> 03:23:41.509
WHETHER IT'S ADDICTION WHETHER

03:23:41.576 --> 03:23:42.777
IT'S MENTAL HEALTH WHERE

03:23:42.843 --> 03:23:45.479
INDIVIDUALS CAN THEN BE TAKEN

03:23:45.546 --> 03:23:47.415
AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES WILL BE

03:23:47.481 --> 03:23:50.051
PLACE THIS IS A BEEN FUNDED

03:23:50.117 --> 03:23:53.054
NOW- THROUGH PRIVATE BUT ALSO

03:23:53.120 --> 03:23:55.156
THROUGH THE COUNTY. WITH MHS

03:23:55.222 --> 03:23:57.792
DOLLARS- SO I JUST WANTED TO

03:23:57.858 --> 03:23:59.327
SHARE THAT AS I KNOW THEY'RE

03:23:59.393 --> 03:24:01.462
DOING VIRTUAL TOURS I WAS ABLE

03:24:01.529 --> 03:24:04.231
TO DO THAT. BUT IT THE IDEA

03:24:04.298 --> 03:24:07.234
AGAIN IS INSTEAD OF HAVING

03:24:07.301 --> 03:24:09.337
FOURTEEN BEDS ON A FIFTY ONE

03:24:09.403 --> 03:24:12.673
FIFTY. WHERE THERE IS NOW UP TO

03:24:12.740 --> 03:24:14.542
NINETY DADS AND THIS IS IN ONE

03:24:14.609 --> 03:24:16.310
LOCATION AND ORANGE COUNTY BUT

03:24:16.377 --> 03:24:18.379
THE PLAN IS OVER THE NEXT TEN

03:24:18.446 --> 03:24:21.482
YEARS TO BUILD TWO MORE- I

03:24:21.549 --> 03:24:23.351
THINK IT'S VERY VERY INNOVATIVE

03:24:23.417 --> 03:24:24.952
BUT ONE OF THE KEY PARTNERS

03:24:25.019 --> 03:24:26.721
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN INVOLVED

03:24:26.787 --> 03:24:28.923
BEFORE OR THE HOSPITALS. AND

03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:30.358
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE VESTED

03:24:30.424 --> 03:24:32.460
INTEREST THERE IS THAT IT'S

03:24:32.526 --> 03:24:35.363
VERY EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE PEOPLE

03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:37.765
WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES I AND

03:24:37.832 --> 03:24:40.635
MANY TIMES THEY COME IN AND OUT

03:24:40.701 --> 03:24:42.503
IN THIS THIS IS MUCH OF MORE OF

03:24:42.570 --> 03:24:45.106
A HUMANE DIGNIFIED WAY TO LOOK

03:24:45.172 --> 03:24:47.541

THAT. IT'S ONE MODEL I THROW

03:24:52.013 --> 03:24:53.714
THAT OUT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

03:24:53.781 --> 03:24:57.318
CERTAINLY. A STEP IN THE RIGHT

03:24:57.385 --> 03:25:00.421
