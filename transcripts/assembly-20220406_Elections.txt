TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID LOCKER ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY WILL BE OPERATING AT SUB COMMITTEE CORRECT CORRECT THANK. MISTER BAN. AND HAD TO GO TO A LOCAL. MAY PRESENTABLE GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE'S WORK WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL WILL BE ACCEPTING THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX WILL CREATE THE CIVIC LEARNING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT FUND T INCREASE VOTER REGISTRATION IN COUNTIES WITH THE LARGEST PERCENTAGES OF UNREGISTERED ELIGIBLE VOTER. AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR STUDENTS AND SEVERAL PILOT COUNTIES. AS YOU ALL KNOW VOTING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO EXPRESS OUR VOICE HOWEVER UNTIL THE RECORD INTEREST- GENERATED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. FEWER THAN 60% F ELIGIBLE VOTERS HAVE EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN STATEWIDE ELECTIONS IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. HISTORICALLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE UNDER REPRESENTED IN THE VOTING POPULATION. ADDITIONALLY THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S RESTORED VOTING RIGHTS THROUGH PROP SEVENTEEN TO THE ROUGHLY FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON PAROLE IN THE STATE THERE IS NO OUT REACH TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCES OR REGISTER AND VOTE. VOTING IS A HABITUAL PROCESS BUT THE YOUNGEST GROUP OF ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF REGISTRATION. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX WILL ALSO ALLOW THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO WORK WITH SEVERAL INTERESTED PILOT KERN COUNTY'S CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE RESOURCE RESOURCES TO LOCALLY DESIGNED AND EXECUTED. US THE CIVIC AND VOTER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY DEPENDS ON THE ENGAGEMENT OF EVERY CITIZEN AND STARTING WITH THE YOUNGEST CALIFORNIANS TO TEACH THEM THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING AS A WAY TO PARTICIPATE AND GUIDE THEIR FUTURE HAS. NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX CREATES A SPECIFIC FUND FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO DO TWO THINGS. IT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT TO REGISTRARS OF VOTERS IN COUNTIES WITH FEWER THAN 80% REGISTRATION SO THEY CAN CREATE- SPECIFIC OUTREACH PROGRAMS FOR THE MOST UNDER REPRESENTED GROUPS IN THEIR COUNTY. AND SUPPORTS HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO INCREASE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND PUBLIC COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND STRONG SUPPORT FROM VOTING ADVOCATES AND SEVERAL COUNTY REGISTRARS. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL WE ARE ALSO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND HER TEAM AND WE WILL NOT SHARE ANY FUTURE. WITH WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JESSE SALINAS REGISTRAR VOTERS FROM YOLO COUNTY AND BILL JULIAN MY CONSTITUENTS AND FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER WHICH WOULD LIKE TO. JENNER FIRST BILL BILL JULIAN OKAY IT'S A CONSTITUENT OF IS THAT WE ARE CURRY HAVE A RETIRED ASSEMBLY STAFF PERSON. AB TWENTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX ESTABLISHES THE CIVIC LEARNING OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT FUND AS A PERMANENT INSTITUTION UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE. TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE FRONT LINES OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT THE LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS TO MEET FACE TO FACE WITH VOTERS ESPECIALLY YOUNG VOTERS. IT BUILDS ON A CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN IN THE LAW SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES BUT NEVER CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED OR ENFORCED MATT IS THAT LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS BE RESPONSIBLE TO REACH OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITIES TO FULLY REALIZE THAT MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WITH THE HELP AND SUPPORT THE SECRETARY OF STATE. YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RECOGNIZES THERE BEEN A SERIES OF PROGRAMS AND RULE SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THAT REFLECTED THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENTION. THAT THE SECRETARY STATE AND LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIALS COOPERATE TO IMPROVE VOTER REGISTRATION AND VOTER PARTICIPATION. ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE IMPROVED VOTER REGISTRATION OR DISSIPATION BUT THE FACT REMAINS. THAT A LARGE PROPORTION OF A RESIDENT ELIGIBLE VOTERS ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT PARTICIPATING ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. BY PROVIDING A PERMANENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK AND PERMANENT FUNDING FOR COORDINATING PROGRAMS THAT REFLECT BOTH ENABLING LOCAL CREATIVE PROGRAMS AND STATE LEVEL OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. WE CAN EXPAND ON THE UNPRECEDENTED UPSURGE IN VOTER PARTICIPATION WE SAW THE TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL ELECTION. THIS BILL IS THE POLICY OF FACILITATING COOPERATION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO MAXIMIZE VOTER PARTICIPATION ALL OF TURN OVER MY COLLEAGUES- MISTER SALINAS ABOUT THE DETAILS THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS JESSE SALINAS I AM YOLO COUNTY'S ASSESSOR CLERK RECORDER AND REGISTER VOTERS. I'M HERE THIS MORNING AS MY RIGHT AS A REGISTER OF VOTERS WEARING THAT HAT- THESE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE DEMONSTRATED JUST HOW FRAGILE OUR DEMOCRACY IS. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW ELECTIONS WORK. EXPERIENCE A LEARNING IS TRULY A POWERFUL TOOL. WHAT BETTER WAY TO TEACH FUTURE VOTERS THE BEAUTY OF OUR ELECTION PROCESS THAN TO EXPERIENCE IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL. EITHER BY PARTICIPATING AS AN ELECTION WORKER AN OFFICIAL ELECTION OR THROUGH AN ON CAMPUS STUDENT ELECTION THAT CLOSELY MIRRORS AND OFFICIAL ELECTION EXPERIENCE WITH THE STATE SEAL OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WILL EMPOWER AND HELP ENGAGE YOUNG VOTERS TO LEVELS NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN. IF PASSED THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE THREE IMPORTANT OBJECTIVES WHAT INCREASED VOTER REGISTRATION BY PROMOTING AND LAUNCHING A NEW ERA OF INNOVATIVE OUTREACH EFFORTS. TO STRENGTHEN AND PROMOTE OUR DEMOCRACY OF FUTURE VOTERS BY PROVIDING A POWERFUL LINK TO THE STATE SEAL OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. AND THREE PROVIDE HANDS ON ELECTION EXPERIENCES TO PARTICIPATING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ENHANCING. THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF AND CONFIDENCE IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS WHICH COULD OVER TIME LEAD TO INCREASE TURNOUT OF YOUNGER VOTERS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND WE ALL KNOW THAT'S A GROUP THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP LIFT THEIR PARTICIPATION RATE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. FOR WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. WE WILL. ONE SECOND.

GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MICHELLE ANDREWS I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE DAVIS COLLEGE DEMOCRATS AND A FORMER STUDENT ALEXION POLL WORKER- IN STRONG SUPPORT. NINE THIRTY SEVEN. SANTIAGO RODRIGUEZ LOOK CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS CALLING IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MODERATOR ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I REQUEST BY SHARE CERTAIN ARE THERE ANY STUDIES- THE INDICATE WHY ARE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT. ENGAGING BECAUSE THEY ARE VOTER MOTOR NOW ONCE THEY GET THEIR LICENSES THEY GET REGISTERED. SO THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON THAT IS CREATING. THIS LACK OF INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING IN OUR DEMOCRACY SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT KIND OF STUDIES IN CHEN AND HOW'S THIS EXPENDITURE OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS- GOING TO HELP THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING REGISTERED BECAUSE WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP GET REGISTERED. IT'S THE INTEREST LEVEL AND THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I'D LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THANK YOU YES I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- NUMBER- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT. IF IT'S IF YOUNG FOLKS DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A CONNECTION TO WHAT THEIR VOTE MEANS ND HOW THEIR VOTE MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THIS ELECTION. THEY HAVE BECOME DISENGAGED THERE ARE. STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT IF YOU GET YOUNG PEOPLE ENGAGED IN VOTING EARLY ON. THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE VOTERS. ON THAT SUBSIDIZING FORWARD ONTO THE COMMITTEE I KNOW YOUR ERA ANALYSTS HAS DATA THAT SHOWS AS WE START TO ENGAGE PEOPLE EARLY ON STUDENTS STUDENTS AT A YOUNG AGE. TO BE ABLE TO START VOTING THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE LIFELONG VOTERS SO GETTING THEM EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN FOR THEM BECOME LIFELONG FOR VOTERS AND WILL INCREASE AT. A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE I THINK THE NUMBER IS. AND THAT YOU CAN CALL ME IF I'M WRONG I THINK IT'S LIKE 40% INCREASE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS TO RECALL THAT. THE FIGURE THAT- BUT WE CAN GET THAT TO YOU SO YES THE THURSDAY THAT SHOWS IF YOU START EARLY ON THAT WE GET THESE AND VOTERS ENGAGE THEY WILL START TO VOTE AND VOTE ON AN ONGOING BASIS WITH A FORD. A SO IT'S SOMETHING BEYOND JUST GETTING REGISTERED IN THIS PROGRAM SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED AROUND THAT REGISTRATION ARE THERE ADDITIONAL. PARTS OF THIS PROGRAM THAT. TO MAKE THIS OUTREACH SOMETHING IT WILL ACTUALLY GET THEM ENGAGED BECAUSE GETTING REGISTERED IS NOT ENGAGING THEM ANYMORE THAN VERY TRUE IT WAS FOR SO THE NEXT STEP AS WELL IN PART OF THIS PROCESS IS ACTUALLY ALLOWING FOR DIALOGUE FOR THESE YOUNG INDIVIDUALS TO TALK TO ELECTED OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND. PART OF WITH THE DATA WILL SHOW IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE- DON'T AND VOTERS IN GENERAL BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE THEY DON'T FOCUS MUCH. ON A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLES SO OUR EFFORT HERE THAT WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING IS ENGAGING YOUNG VOTERS SO THAT THEY CAN START TO LEARN THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE LEVEL ELECTIONS TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DECISIONS BEING MADE HERE IMPACT THEM SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S WHY THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE VOTED A PRESIDENTIAL IT'LL DROP OFF SIGNIFICANTLY IN NON PRESIDENTIAL. SO THE EFFORT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TERMS OF ENGAGING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOPING THE CURRICULUM WILL BE ENGAGING THEM ON THAT LOCAL LEVEL SO. YOU KNOW LOOK POLITICS IS LOCAL AND WRITING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WILL ENGAGE THEM IN A WAY THAT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ENGAGED BEFORE TO HAVE THAT VOICE. TO ONE OF BOTH AND PARTICIPATED A HIGHER LEVEL MOVING FORWARD YEAH. I THINK CIVICS CLASS. IS ONE OF THE REQUIRED CLASSES AND IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND IF WE'RE NOT DOING THAT DURING CIVICS CLASS. AND WE'RE MAKING IT. AND YOU KNOW IT'S JUST IT'S AMAZING YOU JUST SAID THAT BECAUSE- I HAVE SENIORS IN MY FAMILY IN HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEY BARELY GET A QUARTER OF. A SEMESTER RELATED TO CIVICS. AND I THINK IT'S A BIG PIECE THAT WE'RE MISSING AS WELL- I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN BY THESE A PILOT THAT WE'VE DONE INYO COUNTY THAT GETTING CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. INCREASE FROM I THINK THE FIRST MEAN THEY HAD WAS THIRTY THE FOLLOWING YEAR THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY STUDENTS THAT. ATTENDED AND ARE NOW BEING ACTIVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. ON THE OTHER THING WE TALK ABOUT THE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW I DON'T I DIDN'T REALIZE IT AS WELL AS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE. ANYWAY TO ANY FUNDING TO DO OUTREACH AND COUNTIES. AND SO THIS IS A WAY TO ALSO IS TO HELP FUND DO WE HAVE MORE. OUTREACH. INTO THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. GREAT YOU FOR HELPING ME TO UNDER. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THING.

THANK YOU RICHARD THANK YOU COMMITTEE MAY THAT IMPROV TO PRESENT BILL TWENTY NINETY FOUR SIMPLE BILL THAT CREATES AN INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSION FOR KERN COUNTY MODELED AFTER THE STATE COMMISSION THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. THE INDEPENDENT COMMISSION WILL BE MADE UP OF REPUBLICANS DEMOCRATS AND DECLINE TO STATE VOTERS WHO LIVE IN KERN COUNTY- THIS IS BETTY COMMISSION WILL PROTECT TAXPAYERS FROM HAVING THEIR HARD EARNED DOLLARS WASTED ON LAWSUITS LIKE THE ONE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE'RE KERN COUNTY WAS SUED FOR NOT HAVING FAIR POLITICAL MAPS. THE INDEPENDENT REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER COUNTIES LIKE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA BARBARA AND SAN FRANCISCO. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY FOUR IS A CONTINUATION OF THE STATE'S WORK TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND PROTECT EVERYONE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN EQUAL VOTE.

GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAURIE TO FONTAINE AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT FORTY DEVOTED SUPPORT THE FOUNDATION OUR PROFOUND THANKS TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE ARE PROUD TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY FOUR I RAN THE FOUNDATION TWENTY TWENTY ONE REDISTRICTING CAMPAIGN AND WE COLLECTED THOUSANDS OF COMMUNITY OF INTEREST SURVEYS AT FLEA MARKETS COVERT OUTREACH EVENTS FOOD BANKS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN HIGH DESERT. WE INVITED EVERYONE WHO TOK A SURVEY TO LEARN ABOUT REDISTRICTING AND WE HELD MULTIPLE MAPPING SESSION EACH WEEK FOR OVER A YEAR IT GAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AT EVERY HEARING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ULTIMATELY WE EMPOWERED OVER FIVE THOUSAND RESIDENTS TO ENGAGE IN REDISTRICTING PROCESS THESE AT ALL LEVELS OF THEIR GOVERNMENT THESE GRASSROOTS VOLUNTEERS AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BECOME COLLECTIVELY KNOWN. AS THE EQUITABLE MAPS COALITION. BUT EVEN WITH THE BONDS. LEVELS OF AUTHENTIC COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IT WAS EXTREMELY RARE TO SEE FAIR MAPS ADOPTED ATTHE LOCAL LEVEL ANYWHERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND ESPECIALLY IN KERN COUNTY. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE BEST MAPS WE SAW ADOPTED FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'RE AT THE STATE LEVEL. BECAUSE OF THE CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. AND WITHOUT A CITIZENS REDISTRICTING COMMISSION AND KERN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DID WHAT THEY UNFORTUNATELY HAVE DONE MANY MANY TIMES IN THE PAST. THEY PAID HUGE AMOUNTS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO ATTORNEYS AND DEMOGRAPHER'S TO DRAW THE MAPS THAT CONCENTRATE POWER IN THE HANDS OF WHITE AFFLUENT CURRENT RESIDENTS. TO THE PROFOUND DETRIMENT OF CURRENT RURAL AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR THEY HAVE BACK BEEN FOUND BY THE COURTS TWICE TO HAVE DISENFRANCHISED LATINO. THE IMPACT OF THIS BE OVER. KERN COUNTY HAS NEVER DRAWN OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT DISTRICT WITHOUT BEING LEGALLY COMPELLED TO DO SO COSTING TAXPAYERS MILLIONS. AND THE OF THE LACK OF COMMUNITY RESPONSES CALCULABLE LEADERSHIP HAD KERN COUNTY FAILING BY EVERY QUALITY OF LIFE INDICATOR IT IS POSSIBLE THE MEASURE AND THE PANDEMIC WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS MEANS PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES.

THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS AB TWENTY EIGHT OH EIGHT BY SOME MEMBER O'DONNELL SOME MEMBER THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. YOU MAY PRESENT WILL MAY PROCEED IN REDDING YES SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWO EIGHT ZERO EIGHT WHICH WOULD BAN RANK CHOICE VOTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO START BY SAYING I COME AT THIS ISSUE AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER AND SOMEONE WHO HAS WON SEVEN OR SO ELECTIONS EVEN A RIGHT AND ALEXION AND AS ONE WHO IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF DEMOCRACY IN A LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IT AND I CONSIDER MYSELF. A DEFENDER OF THE AMERICAN ELECTORAL PROCESS. AND AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER I'M A PROMOTER OF DEMOCRACY AND ACTUALLY TEACH STUDENTS HOW TO VOTE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME AS A HIGH SCHOOL GOVERNMENT TEACHER. SOMETHING I'LL BE DOING THIS FALL. TO ME THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROTECTING DEMOCRACY AND MAKING SURE ALL CAN PARTICIPATE IN IT AND PROTECTING MAJORITY RULE. SOMETHING MUCH AMERICAN BLOOD HAS BEEN SHED TO DO. I AM THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THE CONCEPT OF ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. AND NOT CHANGE THE WAY WE VOTE SIMPLY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE THE OUTCOME. OF THE LAST ELECTION. AS ONE WHO HAS TAUGHT STUDENTS ABOUT THE VALUE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND NAVIGATED ITS NUANCES FIRSTHAND. I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF HOW WE OPERATE THAT DEMOCRACY. AND I BELIEVE I HAVE THE SAME GOALS ALL OF YOU ON THIS COMMITTEE YOU MISTER CHAIR WHICH IS TO ENSURE OUR ELECTIONS CORRECTLY REFLECT. THE WILL OF OUR PEOPLE AND I'M CONFIDENT THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL DUE TO. THIS MEANS WE SHOULD BE PRUDENT IN EVALUATING PROPOSED REFORMS AND NOT SACRIFICE FUNDAMENTAL ACTS ASPECTS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. IN AN EFFORT TO SOLVE PRACTICAL ISSUES WITH OUR ELECTIONS. AGAIN WE SHOULD AVOID FADS LIKE TERM LIMITS AND RANKED CHOICE VOTING SPREADING IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR NUMBER YEARS IT'S REALLY SPREADING NOW ONE OF EFFORTS JUST. TO REALLY PUT THE GAS ON. ANY TIME WE CREATE A MECHANISM AND A DEMOCRACY. TO DO THE DUTY THAT WHICH IS THE PEOPLE'S IT FAILS. NOW SAY THAT AGAIN. ANYTIME WE CREATE AMERICA AND A MECHANISM IN A DEMOCRACY TO DO THE DUTY THAT WHICH IS THE PEOPLE'S. IT FAILS. TERM LIMITS ARE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. HAS LIMITING THOSE WHO CAN BE ELECTED BEEN THE GREAT FIX EVERYBODY IS SEEKING I THANK NOT MAINLY IT'S IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER BUT NOT NECESSARILY BEHOLDEN TO THE BASIC TENETS OF DEMOCRACY. IN SHORT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS NEVER CONTEMPLATED THAT WE WOULD CONJURE UP A SHORT CUT IN ORDER TO BETTER OUR DEMOCRACY. BUT HERE WE ARE DISCUSSING RANKED CHOICE VOTING WHICH I'M ARGUING TODAY IS A SHORT CUT AND CHEAPENS THE MOCK CHRISSY AND THE EFFORTS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SOUGHT TO PROTECTED AROUND THE GLOBE. FIRST WHAT IS RANKED CHOICE VOTING. WELL IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN SO THERE'S THE FIRST PROBLEM. IT IS DIFFERENT THAN A STANDARD ELECTION WHEREIN THE ONE WHO GETS THE MOST VOTES WINS OR MOVES ON TO A RUNOFF. IT'S VERY DIFFERENT. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE RANKED CHOICE VOTING IS THE PROCESS WHEREIN VOTERS ARE ASKED TO RANK THEIR CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE. INSTEAD OF VOTING FOR A SINGLE CANDIDATE AND ALLOWING THE CANDIDATE GETS THE MOST VOTES TO BE THE VICTOR. OR TO GO WORK TO GO FOR TO A RUNOFF. WITH RANKED CHOICE VOTING SHOULD NO CANDIDATE ACHIEVE A MATE MAJORITY VOTE THE LOWEST VOTE EARNING CANDIDATE. IS ELIMINATED AND THE VOTERS NEXT PREFERRED CANDIDATE IS COUNTED INSTEAD. THE PROCESS CONTINUES AND ROUNDS. AND IT REPEATS UNTIL A CANDIDATE HAS A MAJORITY OF VOTES IN THE ELECTION. THERE COULD BE MANY ROOM THERE COULD BE MANY ROUNDS OF VOTERS MAY VOTE MANY TIMES FOR JUST AN OFFICE. SO AGAIN RANK CHOICE VOTING REQUIRES VOTERS TO RANK CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE OF NOBLE IF NO CANDIDATE IN ROUND ONE RECEIVES 50% OF THE FIRST PLACE VOTES THE ONE RECEIVING THE FEWEST VOTES IS ELIMINATED. AND THAT CONTENDERS SECOND PLACE VOTES ARE ALLOCATED TO THE REMAINING CANDIDATES. THESE RE OUT THESE ROUNDS REALLOCATING SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH PLACE VOTES OR MORE FROM THE BOTTOM UP CONTINUE. UNTIL ONE CANDIDATE. GETS A MAJORITY CONFUSED. YOU SHOULD BE BECAUSE SORT OF VOTERS MANY VOTES NOT ONE PERSON ONE VOTE. BUT WHY SUPPORT RANKED CHOICE VOTING AND I MET WITH SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS NO LAW ALL SUPPORTERS BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I HEARD- AND WHY THEY SUPPORTED RANKED CHOICE VOTING. IT SAVES MONEY BECAUSE THERE WILL ONLY BE ONE ELECTION AND MY RESPONSE TO THAT IS SIMPLE. WE'RE GOING TO ALTER DEMOCRACY JUST TO MAKE ELECTIONS CHEAPER. NOBODY SAID DEMOCRACY WAS FREE. AND WE CAN AFFORD ELECTIONS. ANOTHER REASON RANK CHOICE VOTING IS MORE CONVENIENT FOR PEOPLE ON THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO FILL OUT ANOTHER BALLOT IN A RUN OFF MY RESPONSE TO THAT. DEMOCRACY IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT AND WE SHOULD NOT CHEAP IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS JUST TO APPEASE THOSE WHO DON'T NOT WANT TO BE INCONVENIENCED WITH VOTING. VOTING IS A CIVIC DUTY NOT A CIVIC BOTHERED. NEXT RANK CHOICE VOTING HELPS ME GET THOSE THAT SUPPORT MY CAUSE IS MORE EASILY ELECTED ESSENTIALLY SPECIAL INTERESTS CAN BETTER CONTROL THE OUTCOME. I BELIEVE THAT STATEMENT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF DEMOCRATIC VALUES. BUT I'VE CONVENIENCE AND I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE. NOW THE PROBLEMS WITH DRINK CHOICE VOTING. NUMBER ONE VOTER CONFUSION HEY ASKING VOTERS TO RANK THEIR CHOICES INSTEAD OF CHOOSING A SINGLE CANDIDATE CONFUSES VOTERS WHO ARE USED TO THE DEMOCRATIC CONCEPT OF THE ONE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THIS DYNAMIC IMPACTS MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES MOST. ENGLISH LEARNERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE ACCESS TO MAINSTREAM MEDIA OR AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN MAY BE TAKING PLACE ARE LEFT TO FIGURE IT OUT FOR THEMSELVES I GIVE THE EXAMPLE OF THAT FROM MY OWN LIFE. I TAUGHT ESL FOR MANY YEARS THAT'S ADULTS RIGHT MANY HAD LIMITED ENGLISH RIGHT BUT MANY WERE CITIZENS OR BECOMING CITIZENS AND I WOULD TEACH THEM HOW TO VOTE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE. TRYING TO TEACH SOME OF THESE FOLKS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH. HOW TO VOTE. THE DIRECT CHOICE IT WOULD BE VERY A VERY COMPLEX TASK BECAUSE IT'S SO HARD. TO EXPLAIN. RANKED CHOICE VOTING DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS MANY VOTERS GIVE UP AND DON'T FINISH VOTING AND ALL AROUND BECAUSE OF VOTER FATIGUE. ONE STUDY SHOWED THAT ALMOST 30% OF VOTERS GAVE UP BEFORE COMPLETING ALL OF THE VOTING ROUNDS BECAUSE OF FATIGUE CONFUSION. IT CAN BE ARGUED THAT THIS IS DISENFRANCHISEMENT MASQUERADING AS A MORE EFFICIENT DEMOCRACY. MAKE GAMING THE VOTE THIS IS REAL. THOSE WHO FULLY UNDERSTAND RANKED CHOICE VOTING FOLLOW SPECIAL INTERESTS OFFICE CAN TURN ELECTION INTO SOMETHING AKIN TO A PREDICTIVE VIDEO GAME. WHEREIN A GROUP OF VOTERS ARE LED TO VOTE IN SPECIFIC PATTERNS SO AS TO ELIMINATE ONE CANDIDATE AND PROP UP ANOTHER THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ROUNDS OF VOTING. NEXT MAJORITY RULE. RANKED CHOICE VOTING GOES AGAINST THE CONCEPT OF ONE PERSON ONE VOTE AND MAJORITY RULE. IF A CANDIDATE ONLY ACHIEVES A MAJORITY BY ELIMINATING THOSE THAT IS NOT A REAL MAJORITY. MAJORITY RULE WITH MINORITY RIGHTS IS AN AMERICAN VALUE. TANK NEXT WILL RANK CHOICE VOTING FIX THE PROBLEM. WELL THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND A FIX FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS A PEJORATIVE AND IT IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER WE SHOULD NOT RESPOND TO OUR COLLECTIVE CHALLENGES BY JUMPING ON THE FAD OF THE DAY AND HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE THE FIX THE FIX THAT EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR AND THAT HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO BY SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING. WE HAVE TRIED FADS IN THE PAST THEY HAVE NOT WORKED. IN SHORT MISTER CHAIR. AB TWO EIGHT ZERO EIGHT PRESERVES OUR DEMOCRACY AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA VOTERS BY SAYING NO TO RANKED CHOICE VOTING. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. BUT I HAVE NO WITNESSES OFFICE. THANK YOU SIR I DON'T KNOW WITNESSES- PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I DO SEE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RESTORE ROSE YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME FORWARD. WE HAVE MISS MISS RUTH DAWSON FROM THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION. ON THE PHONE LINE IS ROSY MAY BEGIN HENEVER YOU ARE READY. AND WE ALSO HAVE DISTRICT HEALTH CARE AND AS A POSSIBLE EXPERT WITNESS IF NECESSARY THE COMPANY HAS QUESTIONS. WHICH WAS CLEAR BEFOREHAND. MAY NOT BE NECESSARY MORNING CHAIR BRIAN MEMBERS AMADOR ROSE WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN BUILDING A MORE REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY WE HAVE A LOT OF NEW OF RULES THAT REALLY MOVE THAT BALL FORWARD. AB TWO EIGHT AWAY GOES IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND WE RESPECTFULLY BUT STRONGLY OPPOSE IT RANKED CHOICE VOTING HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFULLY USED A LOCAL CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS SO I TAKE ISSUE WITH THE IDEA THAT IT'S JUST A FAD. IT HAS A NUMBER OF ADVANTAGES WINNING CANDIDATES ARE ELECTED WITH MAJORITY SUPPORT A SINGLE ACTION WITHOUT THE NEED OR THE EXPENSE OF A RUN OFF ELIMINATES. ELIMINATES THE SPOILER EFFECT I MEAN HAVE SOME WATER- SO THE WINNER IS A BETTER REFLECTION OF VOTERS PREFERENCES AND THERE'S N NEED FOR A PRIMARY SO LOCAL ELECTIONS CAN BE HELD RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION WILL TURN OUT ITS HIGHEST AND ALSO VERY. MUCH MORE REPRESENTATIVE. IN THE BAY AREA RCV. HAS LED TO MORE WOMEN CANDIDATES OF COLOR BEING ELECTED TO LOCAL OFFICE IN IN CITIES WITHOUT RCV. THE BILL'S FINDINGS CLAIM THAT RCV IS UNDEMOCRATIC BECAUSE CANDIDATES WITH A PLURALITY OF FIRST CHOICE VOTES MAY NOT WIN IN THE ELECTION. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH MORE DEMOCRATIC THEM PLURALITY WINNER ELECTIONS BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT THE WINNER HAS MAJORITY SUPPORT. FINDINGS ALSO CLAIMED THAT RCB'S CONFUSING AND CAUSES VOTERS TO MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE- BUT THIS ACTUALLY JUST RALLY ISN'T SUPPORTED BY THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN. RCV IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD- PROCESS VOTERS JUST INDICATE THEIR FIRST SECOND AND THIRD CHOICE AND POLLING SHOWS THAT. VOTERS UNDERSTANDING OF RCV AND THE OVER VOTE ERROR RATES ARE ACTUALLY NO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE SEE WITH BOTH PLURALITY IN TOP TWO. VOTING MOREOVER VOTERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY PREFER RCV TO THE SYSTEM IT REPLACED STRONG EVIDENCE VOTER COMFORT WITH THE SYSTEM. THIS BILL NOT ONLY BANS FUTURE USE OF OUR TV IT ALSO REPEALS IT IN SIX CITIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING IT. REPRESENTING MORE THAN ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS- AND IN THOSE CITIES IT WAS ACTUALLY DEMOCRATICALLY ADOPTED WITH OVERWHELMING VOTER SUPPORT 59% VOTED FOR IT IN SAN FRANCISCO RECENTLY 73% IN ALBANY. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULDN'T BE OVER WRITING A BILL THAT HAS THE WILL OF LOCAL VOTERS TO ADOPT PROGRAM DEMOCRACY REFORMS THE LEGAL VOTERS STAND IN STRONG OPPOSITION WE URGE A NO VOTE. AND I BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE ON THE EAST FROM THE ACLU IS ON THE LINE TO TESTIFY. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SO WE HAVE ROOF DAWSON ON THE LINE EIGHTEEN T. OPERATE IF YOU CAN. AND BRUCE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT EIGHT GOOD MORNING CAROLINA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY HUNDRED THOUSAND WITH A VALUE CALIFORNIA ACTION AND LIKE BELIEVE WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO AB TWO EIGHT AWAIT ESPECIALLY THE TIME AND VOTING RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK ACROSS THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT PASSED LEGISLATION PROHIBITING THE VOTING REFORM THEY CAN DELIVER BETTER REPRESENTATION AND MARK FAIR ELECTORAL UP. ESPECIALLY FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WOMEN AND OTHER MARGINALIZED GROUPS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THREE WAYS RCV CONTRIBUTE TO MARKET THE PROPERTY FIRST I THINK IMPROVE DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPATION BY ALL GROUPS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH STARKLY DIFFERENT. ADMINS ROAD THE PLANES ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR TV IS THAT IT CAN DETERMINE A MAJORITY WINNER AND A SINGLE HIGH TURN OUT ELECTION BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR A PRIMARY LOCAL ELECTIONS CAN BE CONSOLIDATED WITH NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION WHEN TURNOUT IS MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENTAGE POINTS HIGHER ON AVERAGE AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES PRECIPITATION IN THE MARKETS THREE GENERAL ELECTIONS OUR OFFICE ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE. OF YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. THE SECOND ARE HAS ONE TO MARKET RAPPER. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I TO TWENTY STUDY BEAR ELECTION I'M THAT WENT. HAVE WON BOTH STARTS THE DELUXE. IN FACT WOMEN DROPPING. ON CITY. ATTEMPT HIGHER IN BEING CITY OR YOU THINK HE'D BE. AND ANOTHER FOUND THAT CAN BE OF COLOR IN THE AREA OF ONE. 2% OF WILL A LOT ELECTION COULD BE ADOPTION OUR- COMPARED WITH ONLY INTERACTION. AND THIRD THE MALL SEATS OF OUR- ALSO IMPORTANT VOTING RIGHTS TO ALL THE COMBAT THE DIFFERENCE. BY OF COMING OF COLOR WHETHER IT'S RACIALLY POLARIZED VOTING. IN FACT THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RECENTLY USED TO MARKET THE RCD OF THE VOTING RIGHTS REMEDY. AND EIGHTY TWO WAIT WAIT WOULD TAKE THE TOOL COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE. HAVE A BETWEEN WITH PREVENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MEETING MORE REPRESENTATIVE BUT TIME. COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE REPRESENTATION FOR WOMEN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU MR MODERATOR WE WILL NOW MOVE TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR. I SEE MISTER MISTER MAY UP I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL O'DONNELL- BUT IN LARGE PART BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO BUT THE IMPACT I'M A STRONG SUPPORTER OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING PICK I THINK WE SHOULD AT B. X. EXPANDING AT THIS- OF COURSE OF THE AUTHOR- IS OF IS A GOOD AS A GOOD FRIEND OF A- HIGH REGARD FOR HIM- AND- HIS- HIS PASSION- FOR THINGS YOU CAN TELL HE'S PASSIONATELY OPPOSED TO RANK CHOICE VOTING BUT I'M PASSIONATE IN FAVOR OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN FACT I THINK IT'S A TOOL THAT WE SHOULD BE USING TO FURTHER- OUR OUR DEMOCRACY- NOT NOT NOT LIMITED SO I WILL BE OPPOSING. THIS BILL TODAY. I SMALL I THINK WE SHARE THANK YOU MR DOLLAR PRE SHEET THE- PASSION OF YOUR OPENING STATEMENT- I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I WAS ACTUALLY REMINDED BY URINALYSIS THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS I SHOULD SAY. THAT MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS ALONG WITH- MISTER LANDAU ON RANKED CHOICE VOTING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. A NUMBER OF BAY AREA JURISDICTIONS HAVE RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN PLACE- I DO THINK THE DATA IS COMPELLING THAT THE ELECTION RESULTS. OF A RESERVE RESULT IN. A CANDIDATES GETTING ELECTED THAT BETTER REPRESENT THE POPULATIONS AS A WHOLE- THAT THERE IS DIVERSIFICATION AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS PULL- I THINK THAT'S ALL PRETTY COMPELLING IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE- IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT GOVERNING BODIES THAT. BETTER REPRESENT OF THE PUBLIC THEY SERVE- SO I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. WITH WITH THE CABBIE OUT THAT THIS FEEL STILL. LIKE WE'RE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PHASE% TO SOME DEGREE. I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO SEE WHAT THE OVERALL NET EFFECT IS BUT I THINK THE EARLY RESULTS ARE VERY ENCOURAGING SELL- AS A AS A SUPPORTER OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING. I CAN'T BE WITH YOU TODAY MR DAUDA BUT APPRECIATE TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THESE ISSUES THAT I KNOW AS A- FORMER GOVERNMENT TEACHER I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND THE SON OF A FORMER GOVERNMENT TEACHER WHO HAS. MANY OF THE SAME AIMS IN TERMS AIMS IN TERMS OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. ON AND pDEGREE OUR OUR IMPERFECT DEMOCRACY BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR MAKE THREE COMMENTS. THANK YOU. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR UP. I THINK THAT'S A GREAT LINE THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN JUST ENDED WITH WHICH IS FOR TRYING TO PERFECT ARE IN PERFECT MARKER C. AND SO WAS OF THAT REQUIRES DEBATE AND DISCUSSION AND CERTAINLY GET MISTER O'DONNELL I. RESPECTTHE POSITION YOU YOU BRING ON THIS IN TERMS OF- A GOVERNMENT TEACHER AND DEALING WITH THOSE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND HAVING THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT THERE'S ONE BENEFIT OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING THAT I THINK DOES NOT GET IDENTIFIED ENOUGH AND I THINK THEY'RE BEEN VERY MANY GOOD THINGS IDENTIFIED HERE- PARTICULARLY THE AMOUNT OF MINORITY REPRESENTATION AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS. THAT I HAVE. WITNESSED OVER AND OVER AGAIN- A CITY WHERE A CANDIDATE WHO HAD NO ABILITYTO GET A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE CITIZENS OF THAT CITY TO BE ON THE CITY COUNCIL. CONSISTENTLY TERM AFTER TERM WOULD WIN ELECTIONS BECAUSE A CANDIDATE HAD TWO THINGS GOING FOR IT THAT HE HAD A SMALL GROUP MINORITY GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ALWAYS GOING TO VOTE FOR. AND HE ALWAYS MADE SURE THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF CANDIDATES RUNNING HE WOULD GO OUT AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO RUN BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE THAT RAN. THE MORE HE WAS ASSURED THAT HIS 28% OF THE VOTERS WAS GOING TO GUARANTEE HIM A SEAT AND SO I THINK DEMOCRACY IS NOT SWELL SERVED WHEN YOU HAVE. REPRESENTATIVES ON THE CITY COUNCIL THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY VOTED AND THEY DO NOT HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE. THEY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EVER GET A MAJORITY VOTE. AND THAT IS TO ME THE GREAT BENEFIT OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING HIS THAT YOU AT LEAST GET SOMEONE WHO IF IT WAS DOWN TO TWO PEOPLE. THIS PERSON WOULD NEVER HAVE WON A TWO PERSON RACE. I THINK IT IN THE IN THE CITY THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND SO- WITH THAT- I CERTAINLY AND MOST. OF IT IS JUST TIME REMAIN A SUPPORTER OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING AND- WOULD LOVE TO. HEAR SOME MORE- OF YOUR SAJAN SITES ABOUT THE WHOLE VOTING PROCESS AS IT GOES FORWARD AND. I'M SINCERE WHEN I SAY THAT. THANK YOU. RESEARCHERS ARE. HI- SOME MEMBER O'DONNELL FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- COMMITTING YOURSELF TO TEACHING OUR KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL THE IMPORTANCE OF VOTING WE WANT TO SPEND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TODAY TO DO EXACTLY THAT WHEN WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT HIGH SCHOOLS SO I APPLIED YOU ARE YOUR EFFORTS IN THE OTHER TEACHERS- EFFORTS AS WELL OF MY ISSUE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS A DEFECT ON CHARTER CITIES- CHARTER CITIES ARE ARE AT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW AND HOPEFULLY THEY TEACH THAT AND CIVICS TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GENERAL ON A CHARTER CITY. AND AT CHARTER CITIES ARE THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY SEEK A LITTLE MORE ECONOMY- FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT- THEN- AND A CITIZENS AT THAT LIVE THERE- SEEK THAT ALSO AND- DISALLOWING THEM TO ENGAGE IN THE RANKED CHOICE VOTING- I THINK TO ROADS SOME OF THAT AND- AND THEREFORE- BECAUSE OF THAT- I BAG. MAN. NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. GREAT AND I THINK MY RESPONSE WOULD BE. THAT THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY. IT HAS A DUTY TO PROTECT VOTING. AND EVEN OF THAT AMBULANCE ON THE AUTHORITY. OF A CHARTER CITY TO NOT DO THAT THIS BILL IS THE RIGHT THING BUT I APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. HELLO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS ALSO WITH- COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE THE FIRST COMMAND THE AUTHOR IT'S NOT OFTENTIMES YOU'LL SEE THIS THE AUTHOR THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY SPONSORS BUT IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT THE DEEP COMMITMENT AND THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE IN THE PREPARATION AND IDENTIFYING THESE ISSUES ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR ALLOWING THIS CONVERSATION TO BE HAD BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND CONTINUING TO REFLECT ON THE TYPE OF. ACCESSIBILITY I THINK AS GOVERNMENT WE HAVE A DUTY AND AN OBLIGATION SIMILAR IT IS I KNOW THE OPPOSITION WOULD AGREE WHICH IS THAT FOR THE EVERYDAY VOTER TO EXPLAIN TO THEM IN A COHERENT WAY FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN IS IMPORTANT- AND TECHNOLOGY THAT THE PROPOUNDS. THE AUTHOR SOME OF DONALD. AS OUTLINED SOME DEEP CONFUSION. IN WHICH IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AS GOVERNMENT AND TO HELP EXPLAIN AND FURTHER EDUCATE AND I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL STAND FIRM TO REFER WILL STAND TO REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO HELPING TO EDUCATE AS MUCH OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY INCREASE TRANSPARENCY. AS WE HAVE VARYING MODELS AND LOOKING AT THE TYPE OF RESULTS THAT WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE AN ECHO THOSE COMMENTS TO AGAIN COMMEND THE AUTHOR. FOR ALLOWING US THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DIALOGUE AND ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE OF THE STATE AND ALSO JURISDICTIONS TO FURTHER EXPLAIN- AS I ALSO HAIL FROM THE BAY AREA. A NUMBER OF FRIENDS FAMILY MEMBERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WILL ASK THAT SIMILAR QUESTION. WHAT DOES TRIGGERING CHOICE AND WHAT IS THE SECOND VOTE MEAN AND- HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE- SO. I SAY THAT AGAIN TO BEGIN JUST COMMEND THE AUTHOR AGAIN. AND LOOK FOR TO THE COULD YOU DISCUSSION THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SO THEM BELOW SAN NO FOR THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE MISTER LANGLY MAKE LOS JUST A QUICK CLOSE AND THEN ASK IF YOU MAY BOB. I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THE REASONS I'M I'M FORWARDING THIS BILL AGAIN AT LEAST A VOTER CONFUSION DATA SHOWS THAT- ESPECIALLY IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES SOMEONE DENY THAT WITH IS ABSOLUTELY A FACT- DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS VOTERS END UP OFTENTIMES GIVING UP. HALFWAY DOWN ABOUT BECAUSE THERE'S FATIGUE THEY GET CONFUSED. AS MANY ROUNDS OF VOTING A GAMING THE VOTE SOME WOULD LIKE THIS QUITE FRANKLY ALLOW SPECIAL INTERESTS TO GAME THE VOTE. MAKE IT LIKE I JUST MENTIONED EARLIER PREDICTED VIDEO GAME. IT'S A THREAT TO MAJORITY RULE I WOULD ACTUALLY COUNTY MISTER BENNETT THAT OF A KIM IF A COUNCIL MEMBER CAN'T GET A MAJORITY VOTE MAYBE IT SHOULD BE A COUNCILMAN. OKAY I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD CREATE A MECHANISM- WHEN SOMEONE COULD BECOME A ACCOUNTS MEMBER WITHOUT A MAJORITY VOTE SO THAT A DIFFERENT WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ON THAT BUT- WE'RE GOOD MAN WE CAN DIFFER- BUT AGAIN THIS WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN THE PROBLEM. IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER INSTANCE EVERYONE HERE SO IN LOVE WITH RANKED CHOICE VOTING. I THINK WE SHOULD. VOTE ON THIS BILL USING RANKED CHOICE VOTING. SO THE TEACHER IN ME CAME OVER AN IDEA. INTERACTIVE EXERCISE HERE. AND AT THE TOP YOU'LL SEE IT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE. IT SAYS AB. TWO TWO EIGHT ZERO EIGHT OFFICIAL RCV BALLOTS SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING HERE THE INSTRUCTIONS. ARE RANK UP TO SIX POSITIONS ON THE BILL. I DO NOT MARK MORE THAN ONE IN EACH COLUMN. DO NOT MARK MORE THAN ONE IN EACH ROW. SHOULD THE COMMITTEE FAILED TO ACHIEVE A MAJORITY POSITION ON THE BILL OF POSITION WILL BE ELIMINATED- NEXT RANK POSITION WILL BE COUNTED. OKAY ONCE MAJORITY POSITION HAS BEEN ACHIEVED HER FINAL POSITION WILL BE RECORDED AS YOUR OFFICIAL POSITION AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE I HOPE YOU'RE NOT CONFUSED WITH THAT THANK YOU MR IT EITHER WAY IF YOU LOOK HERE. THE POSITIONS ARE ARE YOU IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. SOMEWHAT IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. WANT TO VOTE FOR IT BUT CAN'T. PARTIALLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL OPPOSED TO THE FOUR CONFUSE THOSE YOUR CHOICES I HOPE WE CAN USE THE O'DONNELL METHODOLOGY TODAY MISTER CHAIR TO VOTE ON THIS BILL BECAUSE RANKED CHOICE VOTING IS SO WONDERFUL ON UNFORTUNATELY. WE WOULD NEED A MOTION FIRST BUT- I HOPE YOU DO THIS EXERCISE AND IN THE CLASSROOM THAT YOU'LL RETURN TO ONCE A GOVERNMENT TEACHER ALWAYS A GOVERNMENT TEACHER AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. ALSO LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I SEE YOUR PASSION AND- YOUR PERSONAL. INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS FUNCTIONAL- AND HAS A HIGH EFFICACY AS HIGH THE NEXT IF THIS IS POSSIBLE USE RANKED CHOICE VOTING I WAS ALREADY LIMITED. ONLY TO CHARTER CITIES. BUT DISTINCT MEANS THEY'RE ALSO ADDITIONAL TWO CHARTER CITIES THAT VOTED THROUGH BALLOT MEASURES IN TWENTY TWENTY TO APPROVE. THE USE OF RANKED CHOICE VOTING IN FUTURE ELECTIONS AND SO I SEE AN INHERENT CONTRADICTION. IN ENSURING DEMOCRACY BY UNDOING THE WILL AND LOCAL CONTROL OF DEMOCRACY THAT'S ALREADY TAKING PLACE. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. IS THERE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE COMMENT I'D NOT MAKING A MOTION WITH THE BILL I JUST WANNA CORRECT ONE SHORT. MR NOW I'M GONNA GO BACK AND FORTH MR NOW ARE THEY NOT MAKE THE CUT THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU. SO NO MOTION MISTER CHAIR SINGLE MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL THAT THIS BILL REMAINS IN COMMITTEE BUT I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HEARING THE BILL. COULD YOU COULD SAY I DON'T WANNA HEAR THE BILL BECAUSE I GET THIS CAN CONTROVERSIAL VOTES. BUT AGAIN- I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS A- GREAT. DEMOCRATIC EXERCISE WERE ENGAGED IN RIGHT HERE. AND RIGHT NOW SO I THANK YOU AND I THINK THE OPPONENTS TO. THANK YOU MISS OUT ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW MOVES TO THE FINAL ITEM ON TODAY'S AGENDA. AND THAT'S A. B. TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW. THANK YOU SO THE NUMBER AGAIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER TURNER AND COLLEAGUES THIS HELPS TO ENSURE THAT THE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FORTY ONE INSURERS THERE ARE NOTICE OF REGISTRATION CANCELLATION AND HELPING TO SERVE. OUR POPULATIONS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK VERY VOTE TODAY WITH ME AND A BRIEF COMMENTS AS BRITNEY STARTS A FOR FROM ACLU AND DORO SPEND WE GET OF WOMEN VOTERS WELL PEOPLE MAY KICK IT OFF. MORE TO RUN MEMBERS. I'M AROSA AND VOTERS TO CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWO EIGHT FOUR ONE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU TO SOMEONE OVER LOW FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PRO DEMOCRACY BILL. I'M GOING TO SPEAK TO THE PART OF THE BILL THAT PREVENTS INAPPROPRIATE VOTER PURGES AND MY ACLU KALI BRODICK BRITNEY STONECIPHER IS GOING TO SPEAK TO THE CONSERVATIVE SHIP SHIP ASPECTS OF THE LEGISLATION. SO REGULAR VOTER ROLL MAINTENANCE REQUIRES ELECTION OFFICIALS TO REMOVE PEOPLE FROM THE ROLLS FOR VARIETY OF REASONS RIGHT INCLUDING PRISON COMMITMENT. COURT DETERMINE MENTAL INCOMPETENCY DEATH OR BECAUSE THEY'VE MOVED AND NOT RESPONDED TO AN UPDATE REQUEST WITHIN FOUR YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY ERRORS IN THE PIPELINE OF REPORTING SYSTEMS CAN RESULT IN FALSE MATCHES BETWEEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES RECORDS AND ALSO- EGGS SOMETIMES CAUSES ELECTIONS OFFICIALS TO RELY ON OVER INCLUSIVE LISTS WHEN THAT HAPPENS WE END UP DISENFRANCHISES VOTERS AND IT'S VOTERS WERE ALREADY HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED. BLACK VOTERS BROWN VOTERS AND THOSE WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND YOUNG WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. IMPACTED BY THESE A RONI IS VOTER REGISTRATION CANCELLATION SO HUGE. PROBLEM THERE IN TERMS OF EQUITY. NOW IN THE- OF REGULAR VOTER ROLL MAINTENANCE PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES SWITCH TO WHAT'S CALLED INACTIVE STATUS WHEN THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE MOVED ADDRESSES. IF THAT HAPPENS I NOTICE GOES OUT FOR YEARS BEFORE THE ACTUAL CANCELLATION RIGHT FOUR YEARS TO LET FOLKS KNOW THAT THE REGISTRATION IS GOING TO BE CANCELLED IF THEY DON'T VOTE OR UPDATE THEIR REGISTRATION WITHIN THAT NEXT FOUR YEARS. BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT TO LET VOTERS KNOW THAT THEIR REGISTRATIONS ACTUALLY BEING CANCELED FOR THAT ADDRESS CHANGE PROCESS. AND PEOPLE WERE BEING CANCELED DUE TO THINGS LIKE METAL. THE COURT JUDGMENT OF MENTAL INCOMPETENCY OR INCARCERATION THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY KIND OF NOTIFICATION AT ALL SO AB TWO EIGHT FOUR ONE WOULD REQUIRE NOTIFICATION IMMEDIATELY BEFORE CANCELLATION. I WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO ADDRESS A PROBLEMS OF THAT ARE- COMING UP. SO STUDIES INDICATE THAT MULTIPLE COMMUNICATIONS PLUS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CURE THE PROBLEM CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO PREVENT DISENFRANCHISEMENT. AB TWO EIGHT FOUR ONE IS A VERY COMMON SENSE BILL IT JUST NOTIFIES VOTERS AND PROVIDES THEM THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STOP MISTAKING CANCELLATIONS BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY OCCUR. WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'LL TURN IT OVER TO BRITNEY TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSERVATORSHIP ASPECT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THE MORNING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BERNIE STONECIPHER WITH ACLU OF CALIFORNIA ACTION. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY NOT A VOTERS DISABILITIES WERE 6% LESS LIKELY TO VOTE THAN THE OVERALL VOTER POPULATION. FOR VOTERS OF THE MENTAL OR COGNITIVE DISABILITY THAT TURNED OUT GAP IS ALMOST SEVENTEEN PERCENT. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS PASSED REFORMS IN RECENT YEARS AIMED AT PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS WERE PLACED INTO THE CARE OF CONSERVADOR. HOWEVER OUTDATED REPORTING SYSTEMS AND MISINFORMATION ARE PRESENTLY UNDERMINING THAT'S PROTECTIONS. PEOPLE MAY BE PLACED UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP FOR MANY REASONS AND BY LAW THEY RETAIN THEIR VOTING RIGHTS UNLESS THE COURT FINDS THAT THEY CANNOT COMMUNICATE A DESIRE TO VOTE INCLUDING WITH REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS. BUT TROUBLING HOWEVER WHETHER A PERSON UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP HAS THEIR VOTING RIGHTS REVOKED MAY DEPEND MORE ON WHICH COUNTY THEY LIVE IN. THEN ON WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR INTEREST IN VOTING. COUNTY COURTS REPORT CONSERVATORSHIP BREAK VOTING RIGHTS CHANGES AN ALARMINGLY A REGULAR AND UNCLEAR MANNER. THIS MAY BE BECAUSE ABOUT HALF OF COURTS ARE NOT USING THE STANDARDIZED YEAH OPTIONAL FORM THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE CREATED FOR THEM. AND SEVERAL COUNTY STILL APPEAR TO BE RUBBER STAMPING VOTING RIGHTS REMOVAL AND NEARLY ALL CONSERVATORSHIP CASES. THESE PRACTICE RISK PRACTICES RAISE SERIOUS RED FLAGS AND YET CURRENT LAW DOESN'T REQUIRE VOTERS UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP TO BE INFORMED WHEN THEIR RIGHTS ARE EITHER REVOKED OR REINSTATED. AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE WILL CURB FAULTY CANCELLATIONS BY STANDARDIZING REPORTING PROCEDURES AND PROVIDING NOTICE TO AFFECTED VOTERS. SB FIVE A FORMER SIGNED INTO LAW LAST WEEK CREATING NEARLY IDENTICAL REPORTING SYSTEMS AND RESTORATION NOTICES FOR VOTERS WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENSURE THESE BEST PRACTICES ARE ALSO IN PLACE TO PREVENT PROTECT ELIGIBLE VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY ONE WILL IMPROVE ACCOUNTABILITY BY TRACKING THE PERCENT OF CONSERVATORSHIP. THE RESULT RESULT AND VOTING RIGHTS REMOVAL AND PROVIDING TRAINING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT COUNTIES. CALIFORNIA MUST STOP THE AVOIDABLE DISENFRANCHISEMENT OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK YOUR OF THE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OPPOSITION WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ADDITIONAL UBLIC COMMENT STARTING WITH PEOPLE HERE IN THE SAME ROOM AS ANYBODY IN THE HEARING ROOM. WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON AB TWENTY FORTY ONE.
