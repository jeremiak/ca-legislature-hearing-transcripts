I KNOWS MUCH MORE ABOUT THIS BUDGET THAN I WILL EVER KNOW. A MISTER SULLIVAN. BUT BEFORE YOU. STEP ASIDE THERE ARE YOU STAYING ON FOR A PERIOD OF TIME LONGER WITH SUCH ONE MORE WEEK LIKE ONE MORE WEEK. WHAT QUALIFIES A LITTLE WHILE LONGER OTHER CLOTHES YES I'M RETIRING AND? ARE WE. YOU DON'T WITH SCHEDULING THEY WILL PEOPLE WANTED A A LITTLE OVERLAPPING. YOU KNOW I HAD GIVEN THAT BUREAUCRACY I HAD TO COMMIT TO A CERTAIN DATE IN. AND COULD NOT JUST YOUR NAY ARRIVING WE HAVE OF A VERY BUREAUCRATIC ANSWER. I DON'T A QUESTIONS LIKE HOW MUCH LONGERYOU TO BE AROUND BUT OFFICE SEVEN SEVEN WORKING. IF MEMORY SERVES ME WELL I AND YOU WERE ABOUT TO RETIRE A FEW YEARS AGO. AND JUST STAYED ON AT A TIME WHEN. THE AGENCY WAS IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION AND SOME AMOUNT OF FLOOD CONTROVERSY. EVEN A VERY STEADY LEADER DURING THAT OF THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU STAYED ON AND. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN DOING OTHER THINGS. BUT BUT DECIDED TO CONTINUE OUR PUBLIC SERVICE I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND TO WISH YOU ALL THE BEST THANKS VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS SIMILAR I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE. ONE OF THE REASONS I STAYED ON IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN AWESOME MISSION AND. I WANTED TO INCREASE ENGAGEMENT WITH WITH SACRAMENTO WHICH IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO OUR MISSION AND DE AYE WE'VE HAD NOTHING BUT CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR. OUR BUDGET OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES I MEAN FEWER COPS BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED ARE AND THE. IT'S NINE AND I SPENT ALL BREAK A. THAT WAS THE WRONG THING TO SAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMINDS. THE PICKUPS ARE ON THE SENATE SIDE. EMPLEO NURSED AT. WELL PLAYED. LOVE WELL THANK YOU AGAIN AND LET'S PROCEED. AS TIM INDICATED MY NAME IS ELLEN RODDY I AND. THE NEW. DIRECTOR OF ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION REGULATIONS. THANK YOU. QUESTION MARK FRESH. SO OUR FIRST AYE BE CP ON YOUR AGENDA RIGHT REQUEST TO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN VARIOUS FUNDS IN TWENTY THREE. PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE CENTER TO SUPPORTING THE PROGRAMS. IN MEETING AROUND THE COMMISSION MANDATES IN VARIOUS STATUTORY MANDATES. THE AREAS INCLUDE. HUMAN RESOURCES OUR FACILITY AND EMPLOYEE SAFETY PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING SERVICES. OUR BUSINESS SERVICES WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECORDS RETENTION POLICY FORMS MANAGEMENT FLEET MANAGEMENTS AND ASSISTING ABILITY. AS THE NUMBER OF MANDATES EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN. AND THE COMMISSION HAS IMPLEMENTED REFORMS THERE WERE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY YES SIR TO SUPPORT THESE EXPANSIONS AND PERFORMS HAS NOT KEPT PACE. IN ADDITION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF AUDIT FINDINGS OF THESE POSITIONS WILL HELP US FOR. RESPOND TO THOSE AUDIT FINDINGS. THE AGENDA NOTES OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MAY WISH TO ASK IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO APPROACH STAFFING AT THE COMMISSION SO THAT IS NOT IN A SITUATION OF CHRONIC UNDER STAFFING. AS NOTED IN THE BCP. I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THAT QUESTION. PLEASE. SO. WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO PRO ACTIVELY IS TO START? MORE PROACTIVELY CONSIDERING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS CONCURRENTLY AS PROGRAMS. AND STAFF ARE ADDED AND OR GROWN. WE'RE ALSO EVALUATING WHERE THE ADMINISTRATIVE UM STAFF A PARTICULAR ARE LOCATED WE HAVE A PARTICULAR PROBLEM. FOR THE HEADQUARTERS IN SAN FRANCISCO RETAINING ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. GENERALLY THERE IN GENERAL BECAUSE. CLASSIFICATIONS OF SUPPRESSED A SPECIALTY CLASSIFICATIONS. SO GIVEN THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN THE AREA IT IS HARD TO RETAIN PEOPLE WHEN. OTHER OPPORTUNITY SURVEY OF MADE AVAILABLE FOR EXAMPLE THE JUDICIARY IS ALSO LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO SO. WE SOMETIMES LOSE PEOPLE TO THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PAY SCALES. AS WELL AS OTHER PRIVATE SECTOR OPPORTUNITIES. SOBRE LOOKING IT. INCREASING OUR ADMINISTRATIVE PRESENCE IN SACRAMENTO. WHERE THE COST OF LIVING IS LOWER AND THERE'S THE LARGER LABOR POOL OF STATE WORKERS THAT? UNDERSTAND HOW TO ACCOMPLISH ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. WE'RE ALSO. PLENTY TO LOOK AHEAD AT THE MAJOR WORKLOAD THAT WILL BE COMING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IN ASSESSING THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR INFO ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT THAT. WE ARE ALSO. BE IS SOMETHING A MORE FORMAL PROCESS INTERNALLY. WITH LOOKING AT. MONEY TO PREPARE FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR BILL ANALYSES AND CONSIDERING WITH THE IMPACTS WOULD BE ON ADMINISTRATION. SO. YOU DON'T KNOW SINGLE BILL MAY NECESSARILY NECESSITATE AN INCREASE IN ADMIN BUT WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THEM AN AGGREGATE. THERE'S YOU KNOW LIKELY TO BE UMP PRESSURE ON ADMINISTRATION SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT. WERE HOPING TO DO TOO ON ADDRESSED UMBRAGE CHARACTERIZES THE CHRONIC UNDER STAFFING. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THINK YOU ARE. EXCUSE ME ANY QUESTIONS. DEFAULT. BELIAU WERE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. ALRIGHT WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENT TENSION. WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ALL OF THE P. C.. ISSUES COLLECTIVELY AT THE END OF FOR. OF THE PRESENTATIONS. SO OUR NEXT ISSUE IS IS THE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE PROGRAM. IT HAS RESISTED OPERATIONS COMPONENT IN A LOCAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT. AT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AT YOUR STAFF'S REQUEST ACTUALLY. WE SHIFTED TO IT ECP PROCESS RATHER THAN A BCP PROCESS SO. I'LL BE PREPARING NOVEMBER AND AND MAY ESTIMATE. AND I. THREE WILL HAVE SOMETHING IN THE MAY REVISION THAT WITH UPDATED ESTIMATES DISCUSSION FOR THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE COMPONENT. ON ADDITIONALLY REQUESTING ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I THINK FOR POSITIONS. I INSTEAD OPERATIONS TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM ALMOND WIRELESS SERVICES WERE. ADDED TO THE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO. WE HAD A TREMENDOUS INCREASING CASELOAD AND EXPENSES. BUT. THE EGG IT THAT WITH THIS PROGRAM IT'S FALSE ADMITTED THE PREVIOUS PCP THERE WAS NO CORRESPONDING INCREASE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT. THE PROGRAM SO THERE'S. POSITIONS AT A REQUESTED WOULD WORK TO HELP PREVENT AYE WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE PROGRAM. IMPROVE THE RENEWAL RATES ESPECIALLY WIRELESS ON THAT YOUR STAFF HAS REVIEWED OUR ESTIMATE. THE RENEWAL RATES. ARE STRONGER IN THE WIRELINE PROGRAM VERSUS WIRELESS THAT WE'RE EXPLORING WAYS TO IMPROVE. RENEWAL FOR WIRELESS SERVICES TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PARTICIPANTS TO RENEW. WERE ALSO. PLANNING TO IMPROVE. AND MAKE MORE TIMELY A REVIEW OF REQUESTS. FROM PROVIDERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVE BENEFITS. THAT ARE PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS. UP WHEN YOU SAY IMPROVE BENEFITS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE. OF BUT ON THE LIFELINE SERVICE THAT A NUMBER OF. TAX AND THAT AND NUMBER CREATE A LOT OF GIGABYTES THAT YES YES SIR BUT I'D BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE. UNDERLYING RATIONALE IS FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL AND. IF YOU HAVE A DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE TODAY BUT IF THERE ARE ESTIMATES EXAMPLE TO MOVE I THINK IT'S IS IT TWO GIGABYTES. UNDER THE LIFE. DATA A IN THE DATA PLAN UNDER LIFELINE IS THAT RIGHT. SO JUST GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JONATHAN LOCKETS AND I'M A MANAGER IN THE COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION OF THE CPC. TO. PROVIDE TO ENSURE QUESTION AND TO CLARIFY. THE PROGRAM CURRENTLY ONLY FUNDS VOICE USAGE BUT. CARRIERS HAVE ADDED AND SO THE CURRENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT TO RECEIVE THE MAXIMUM. SUBSIDY UNDER THE PROGRAM THEY HAVE TO OFFER A THOUSAND MORE MINUTES AND A THOUSAND MORE TAX. MOST YEARS NOW OFFER UNLIMITED TAX UNLIMITED VOICE. KERR'S OF ALSO STARTED OFFERING DATA FOR TWO REASONS ONE IS TO COMPETE TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO SIGN UP FOR THE SERVICE. AND THE SECOND IS THAT THE FEDERAL LIFELINE PROGRAM HAS OF SUBSIDY PROGRAM OF MINE TWENTY FIVE A MONTH TO QUALIFY FOR THAT THEY HAVE TO OFFER DATA. TO RECEIVE THAT FEDERAL SUBSIDIES SO WHATWE'RE SEEING IS THAT. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND. COMPETITION FOR CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA CARES OF VOLUNTARILY ADDING MORE DATA TO THEIR PROGRAMS TO MAKE THEM ATTRACTIVE BUT. THE STATE PROGRAMS NOT ACTUALLY FUND DATA USAGE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. I SEE A SO WHY IF AT SOME POINT YOU COULD PROVIDE SOME ANALYSIS ON WHAT. A WHETHER YOU THINK THAT. WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING THE PUBLIC'S NEEDS? AND TO. WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO BOB RAISE THE BAR ON THAT? IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. TO HAVE FOR ANY COMMENT FROM ILLEGAL. FINANCE RUST BROWN WITH THE LA NOTES THAT WE HAVE REVIEWED THE ESTIMATES FOR THE LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT WERE PROVIDED IN JANUARY FOR NOW WE THINK THAT THE REASONABLE BUT AS THE COMMISSION MENTIONED OTHER WILL BE UPDATED ESTIMATES IN MAY AND SO. A WE WILL OF COURSE BE% TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THOSE AT THAT TIME. THANK YOU I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON MY EARLIER QUESTION. AYE I THINK ONE OF. A IT IT'S INCONTROVERTIBLE TODAY THAT TO ONE OF THE WAYS TO GET AHEAD IN THE WORLD IS. TO HAVE ACCESS TO A. A NEW MOBILE TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS AND DATA AND COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY AND AND AND THE LIKE. AND SO THE MORE WE CAN FACILITATE THAT FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. I THINK THE BETTER THEIR CHANCE IN AT AGE OF EXTREME INCOME INEQUALITY THE BETTER THEIR CHANCES GOING TO BE AFFECT GETTING ADS ARE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO. SERIOUSLY EXPLORE THAT ISSUE AND SEWER WOULDN'T GO WITH IT. AND IF THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS LET'S MOVE ON ISSUED A BATTERY. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER THREE IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THIS IS A COMBINATION OF. PROGRAMMATIC AND REFORM NEEDS. WE ARE EXPANDING OUR INSPECTION PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTING STAFF. THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I'M INTRODUCING A. WHO EARLY? CHO WHO IS THE. OPERATING AT MANAGER IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WHO A WOMAN AIMS LEE PALMER AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE OFFICE OF UTILITY SAFETY? AND OVER THE COURSE THE QUESTION OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STAFF AT THIS YEAR. AND WHERE THAT'S DIGITAL STAFF TO BE LOCATED. SO FOR SOMEONE SEEK TO THE WORKLOAD. AND THEY'VE BEEN ANOTHER MEMBER OF SAFETY EVENTS IN RECENT YEARS FROM SAN BRUNO TO LEASE A CANYON TO THE BUTTE FIRE IN THE FIRES OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THAT ARE DEMONSTRATING THE US. THAT THE PUBLIC EXPECTS A PROACTIVE APPROACH FROM THE COMMISSION WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY AND PREVENTION OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. THAT REALLY DOES NEED TO BE OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. UNDER SEVERAL WORK OBLIGATIONS THAT WE'RE JUST NOT MEETING TODAY. AND WHICH MUST BE COMPLETED IN ORDER TO MEET OUR SAFETY MISSION. I'M STARTING OFF WITH AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FOR THE GAS PROGRAM. AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONDUCT THE NUMBER OF MOBILE HOME. PARK AND PROPANE INSPECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE DOING. WE ONLY INSPECTED THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF THE MOBILE HOME PARKS. AND. SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE PROGRAM PARK INSPECTIONS WERE NOT INSPECTED AYE DEFEATISM CONCEPT IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. THERE'S TWO HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MOBILE HOME PARKS IN CALIFORNIA. AND TWENTY NINE PROPANE OPERATORS CNC THE SCOPE IF THERE'S THIRTY TWO HUNDRED TOTAL BUT WERE ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT. THAT FOR THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE BECOMING TO. A MOBILE HOME PARK INSPECTIONS PROVIDER ABSOLUTE VITAL SERVICE TO A GENERALLY SPEAKING VULNERABLE. POPULATION. FREQUENTLY FIND OPERATORS AREN'T UPDATING THEIR PLANS THAT ARE UPDATING THEIR USAGE THE NOT UPDATING. ON WHAT THEIR RESPONSE IT BE IF THERE WAS AN INCIDENT. SO IT COMES HIGHLY YOU KNOW LIKELY THAT IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN THEY MAY NOT BE PREPARED. I IN ADDITION. DE GAS IT RIGHT RELIABILITY BRANCH NOW MUST INSPECT. MISCIBILITY MEANNESS SUPPORT GAS OPERATORS IN CALIFORNIA SUCH ME ABOUT A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN THE WORKLOAD OF INSPECTION AT THE ORDER HAVE TO PRODUCE. AND THEN THERE'S NO QUESTIONS ON GAS AND MOVE ONTO RAIL. BUT I DO WANT TO ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION THE. AT THE ISSUES INVOLVING MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE SPECIFIC TO A PROPANE. EQUIPMENT THAT RIGHT YES. I AM. AND NOW LOS ANGELES COUNTY UNINSURED OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE THERE IS A. A BURGEONING GOT POPULATION OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ARE LIVING AND A RECREATION DEL VEHICLES. BUT WOULD THE ISSUES. WOULD YOU EXPECT THE ISSUES SAFETY ISSUES TO BE SIMILAR AND IS THERE AN INSPECTION PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF. BUT IS OUR GOAL TO REACH OUT TO THOSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT INSPECTION PROGRAM FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE AND ARE THESE RECREATIONAL VEHICLES UNLESS THEY ARE PERMANENT RESIDENTS OF A MOBILE HOME PARK AND THEY'RE CONNECTED TO THE ACT READ. IT TO CONNECT TO THE GREAT THAN THEIR PARTY THAT SPECIAL PROCESS. SO WITH OF. A IF THAT'S THE GOAL I TAKE IT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AYE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN AND. PROVIDE ME WITH OF AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO. SPAN THE PROGRAM THAT. JUST GENERALLY WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON HOW. DECAL COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED CATHOLIC THING THAT A. I'M MOVING ON TO RAIL I'M SO FOR THE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND LOOKING FOR RAIL. TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND. UP IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN THE NUMBER NATIONWIDE RAIL RELATE FACILITIES INCREASED BY NINETEEN POINT TWO PERCENT. AND LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA EXPENSE MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY FATALITIES AND AS A RESULT OF RAIL INCIDENTS. ORAL SECTION HAS A NUMBER OF WORK WHAT ITEMS IS UNABLE TO COMPLETE. INCLUDING DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. RAIL CROSSING ENGINEERING BRANCH STILL HAD A HUNDRED ONE INCIDENTS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR THAT I NEED TO CLOSE UP INVESTIGATIONS FOR TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE THE WORKLOAD AT THEY'RE DEALING WITH. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR FORTY SIX WITHOUT WOODIES AND SIXTY THREE INJURED REPORT TO THE PC REGARDING HIGH WELL HIGHWAY RAIL CROSSING ACCIDENTS. SO TO GIVE YOU SOME BACKGROUND RC RC  <u><c.green>BE DOES THAT</c></u> INVESTING RAIL CROSSING RELATED ACCIDENTS THAT FROM THE ROOT CAUSE PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO. NOT ONLY THE RARE ROAD AND HIGHWAY AUTHORITIES POSSIBLE GOVERNMENT'S INTERSECTIONS. AND THEN LASTLY. APPRECIATE NONE OF THAT SEVEN HUNDRED PREEMPTIVELY. RAIL CROSSINGS THE CALIFORNIA INSPECTED LAST YEAR. SO PREEMPTED RAIL CROSSING JUST OKAY SAMMONS UNDERWEAR IS A TYPE OF SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS NORMAL OPERATION TRAFFIC LIGHTS IN INTERSECTIONS NEAR WHERE WILL CROSSINGS. I'M TO BE MODIFIED AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE LIGHTS CAN'T CHANGE PRIOR TO THE GATES COMING DOWN SO YOU DON'T GET ACCESS CAR STUCK INSIDE OF THAT. THAT PASSAGE WAY WHEN THERE'S AN ONCOMING TRAIN. SAD THE SEVEN HUNDRED. NONE HAPPEN CURRENTLY INSPECTED AND IT'S DUE TO RESOURCING WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO DO THAT. ON WINTERS A PAID THAT WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS OF HAPPINESS STAFF AS ONE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE THEM ON TO GET THEM TRAINED. WOULD BE ABLE TO. INSPECT TWENTY FIVE PERSPECTIVE LESS MEANING WOULD BE LOOKING AT FIFTY A YEAR SPECIALLY WHICH START THAT PROGRAM AT. I MENDOZA QUESTION REGARDING LOCATION OF NEW STAFF. SO REGARDING LOCATION FOR THE GAS BRANCH I WOULD BE LOCATING THREE STAFF IN THE CENTRAL REGION. THREE STAFF AND THE SOUTH REGION AND AND FOR THE PROGRAM A PROJECT SUPERVISOR THAT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WHAT THAT CANADA COMES FROM OF WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THEM. BUT MORE THAN LIKELY AT AT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR BE LOOKING THE PLACE HIM SOMEWHERE IN THE CENTRAL REGION JUST BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE A NORTH AND SOUTH. I'M AND THEN RAIL OPERATIONS BRANCH. THERE MAINLY CAN BE LOCATED DOWN THE SOUTH FOR THE LARGER RAILYARDS ARE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE PRIME A REAL GROWTH RIGHT NOW SAYS WE WANT BE PUSHING DOWN. ON THE NEW STAFF THERE AND THEM FOR THEIR RAIL CROSSINGS ENGINEERING BRANCH I WOULD BE LOOKING ONE IN SAN FRANCISCO ONE IN LA AND THREE IN SACRAMENTO. I'M AND AS FAR AS THE ADMIN BUDGET UNIT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THE AGP IS TO BE AND SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES PRIMARILY BEING. MOST FOR SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION THE MAJORITY OF OUR ADMINISTAFF'S LOCATED IN SAN FRANCISCO. DOES NOT ALLOW SUPPORT AT THE SACRAMENTO OR LA OFFICE THAT'S DEDICATED TO SAFETY ENFORCEMENT DIVISION. OPPRESSION THAT ADMINISTAFF OUT THERE RIPPING INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR ACTUAL ENGINEERS INSPECTORS TO RELIEVE THEM OF SOME THIS ADMIN BURDENS. ANY QUESTIONS. MON LOCAL. THINGS CHAIR THINK FOR THE PRESENTATION OF. I REPRESENTED DISTRICT. I WORK CALTRAIN IS A CENTRAL A COMMUTE OPTION AND THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF UP. RAIL RELATED INCIDENTS. IN SAN MATEO COUNTY ON THE ON THE PENINSULA YOU CITED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RAIL RELATED INCIDENTS TO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE. THAT AND I. I'M GOING TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF. MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE SAFEST I INFRASTRUCTURE POSSIBLY ALSO REPRESENTS AMBER HOUSE OF GAS SAFETY ISSUES ARE ARE CRUCIAL BUT. THIS THIS ISSUE AROUND RAIL. INCIDENTS CAN YOU SHED ANY ADDITIONAL. LIGHT ON THAT FROM FROM WHAT YOU KNOW AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT. ADDRESSING. THAT THE MYRIAD. OF SOUP CONCERNS ARE RELATED TO RAIL THAT. YOU COME. FROM. FROM WHAT FROM WHERE I SAID. THE REASON WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE I KEEPING IN MIND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF UTILITY SAFETY SO I PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON GAS AND ELECTRIC BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE RAIL. OF WHAT'S GOING ON IT'S ONLY AN INCREASE AND JUST POPULATION AN INCREASE AND THE LINES BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS USING THAT LINE. SO NOT ONLY ON CALTRANS FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE FREIGHT MOVING ON THAT LINE AS WELL SO YOU HAVE MORE COMPETITION ON THOSE LINES USE IT MORE OFTEN. TRADING SITUATION BUSIER LINE MORE TRAFFIC JUST IN GENERAL MORE PEOPLE. AND WE ARE GOING TO BE ELECTRIFYING CALTRAIN UM'S WHICH WILL CREATE OUT OF THE SERIES OF ISSUES NGUYEN IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CORNER Y. THEM IN A BETTER PLACE UP OF COURSE. WHEN THAT ALL HAPPENS BUT. AND I IS THE INCREASED WORKLOAD ALSO RELATED JUST GENERAL AGING OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS ABSOLUTE AND SORT OF AT THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ABSOLUTELY SO YOU GET THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE WE SEE AT THE ROUTER UTILITIES AND AND RAILS ABSOLUTE NO EXCEPTION TO THAT. TO AS WE GO THROUGH THE UPGRADE TO THE NEW SYSTEM ME TO ENSURE THAT OUR STAFF IS TING UPDATE WITH THE CURRENT TRENDS AND TECHNOLOGIES BEEN PUT IN PLACE. ALLOW ME TO ASK A QUESTION OF THAT PROBABLY BETTER ANSWERED BY MISTER SULLIVAN ON BUT IT'S TRIGGERED BY YEAR A COMMENT. INDICATING THAT YOU BE DOING SOME ADDITIONAL HIRES AND OF THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE AND I KNOW YOU'VE. GOT A LOT OF FUN EMPLOYEES AND SAN FRANCISCO. I WANT TO KNOW IF A ACTUALLY SAN FRANCISCO OR ANYWHERE ELSE AROUND THE STATE. ARE YOU EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING. DO THAT ARE EXTREMELY HIGH HOUSING COSTS IN VARIOUS AREAS OF THE STATE. I. ASSEMBLYMEMBER PLUME SAN FRANCISCO CONTINUES TO BE OUR OUR MAJOR PROBLEM AT THE COST OF LIVING IN SACRAMENTO IS. IS LAUGHS AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET STAFF HERE. OF FOREST SAFETY PROGRAM WHICH HAS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION A LOT OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE REMOTE PARTS OF THE STATE. I AND NUMBER FARMWORKERS ARE HOME BASED IMAGES COME INTO OUR A CONVENIENT CENTER SUCH AS SACRAMENTO AT BAKERSFIELD FOR MEETINGS. THE LOS ANGELES OUR OFFICE IS IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES AND WE. WE ACTUALLY ARE THE HOUSING MARKET ON THE EAST SIDE OF LOS ANGELES GOING OUT ACTUALLY.

ASSEMBLY CISCO PARTICULARLY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE WORKERS OUT THERE PRETTY MUCH OF THE STATE PAY AS NOT COMPARABLE TO THE PREVAILING RATES IN SAN FRANCISCO.

RIGHT WELL THANK YOU ED AT AT AT LEAST TO THE EXTENT YOUR. ATTRACTING PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THEN DRIVE INTO OF THE LA OFFICE WHERE IT. A SOMEWHAT COUNTER PURPOSES NOT SOMEWHAT WHERE COUNTER PROPOSES WITHOUT SOME OF THE VERY. UNDERLYING RATIONALE FOR MANY OF EUROPE YOU SEE PROGRAMS. AND DATA. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR VALIDATING SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE ALL READY ALREADY KNOW BUT I WANT TO KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHETHER IT'S AFFECTING BECAUSE. OF THE PC IN ITS ABILITY TO. RECRUIT TED. FOLKS AT THAT LEVEL YOU YOU YOU WANT TO WE WE EXPECT TO ADD SIX HUNDRED NEW. A AYE SIMI FIFTEEN NEW POSITIONS IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING OFFERED PRINT IN THE THOMAS. LA WE WILL PROBABLY NEED SPACE PARTICULARLY UP BECAUSE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THOSE THOSE PLANKS WE WOULD ACTUALLY. IT'S SINCE LAST JANUARY WE BROUGHT IN CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES FROM THE OUTSIDE OF PROMOTED ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO FILL A VACANCIES WE STILL HAVE QUITE A FEW. BUT A EXERT THEIR CLASSIFICATIONS ARE TOUGH OR THOSE THAT ARE TOUGH STATEWIDE SEARCHES THE ENGINEERING AND OUR REGULATORY ANALYST. HOW ARE WE DID ARE COMPETITIVELY WARY ACTION MENTION THIS BUT I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN OUR VACANCY RATE BELOW THOSE OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD? AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUT. I DON'T WANT A BAD NOTHING.

SO. I CAN UP PROCEED I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY LOOKED AT. OR. PROPOSAL. PART OF THE REASON WE'RE DOING A INCREASING OUR ADVOCACY WORK IS THE COMPLEXITY THERE'S A NEW TRANSMISSION OWNERS.

OH YES I'M SORRY YOU'RE HERE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. COULD YOU ARE COMES THE MICRO. ARE THERE ANY OTHER. INDIVIDUALS WHO WANTS BECOME PUBLIC COMMENT I'M SORRY THEY WERE AND NUMBER PEOPLE STAND NAMED DERECHOS ASSEMBLYMEMBER JUST RUIN THIS UP BADLY NOW IT'S OKAY. BELIEVE ME. DO THAT I HAVE A LOT OF THE LIKE GOT HERE THIS MORNING MAYBE THAT'S THE. WELL THE MORNING GOOD MORNING ALL. AM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE LOW INCOME OVERSIGHT BOARD WITH PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION HOW FOR THOSE THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH OUR BOARD. WE ARE ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE SOME YEARS AGO. IN CONNECTION WITH ADVICE IN THE COMMISSION ON ISSUES OF OF ENERGY BOTH ON GAS ELECTRICITY. TOGETHER WITH WATER TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND IT'S AN EXCITING TIME TO BE INVOLVED IN TERMS OF REPRESENTING COMMUNITIES IN NEED. IT CERTAINLY OVER YOU KNOW VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN CONNECTION WITH ENERGY BURDEN WHICH IS SIX SIGNIFICANT. SO WE ALL KNOW IN TERMS OF THE GROWING GAP BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS. THAT. UTILITY BILLS OR NUMBER TWO IN CONNECTION WITH THE BURDEN THAT PEOPLE ARE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FACE EVERY MONTH. SO HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO KIND OF EMPHASIZE ARE ON I BELIEVE IT'S WHAT ITEM NUMBER. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER ON THE. GAS ELECTRIC IS CONNECTIONS ONE OF THE THINGS ON OUR BOARD THAT WE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW AS A PRACTICAL MATTER AND UTILITIES DO AS WELL AS THEIR PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSE TO S. CONNECTION. SO OBVIOUSLY RATE ASSISTANCE THROUGH CARE. THE. IN ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ARE ONE OF THE WAYS IMMEDIATELY THAT WE CAN RESPOND BUT THERE ALSO IS ANOTHER WAY. AND THE EMERGING SORT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AREA THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREAS BECAUSE I DO REPRESENT AT. MICHAEL BUT THE OF A COMPASS SCENE OUT WHICH IS A STATEWIDE NETWORK OF FARM HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. AMENITIES COMMUNITIES LIVE IN AREAS WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE EXTREME. HEAT IS UNBEARABLE AND YOU KNOW AGAIN EVEN IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW IT'S VERY VERY COLD THE SPECIALLY THIS TIME OF YEAR. SO THE REALITY IS THE LEGISLATOR THE LEGISLATURE'S PAID SOME ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. IN TERMS AMENITIES COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE NATURAL GAS AS A HEATING SOURCE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MORE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS OUT THERE. IS THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM THIS CURRENTLY BEING MAGISTRATE OR BY CST. THIS IS LITERALLY TAKING WHAT THE PC HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR YEARS WHICH IS THE LEVERAGE OF THE VARIOUS FUNDING SILOS. THROUGH A RATE ASSISTANCE THROUGH. ENERGY SAVINGS ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF APPLIANCE A PLACEMENT IN RATHER A STATION. NOW BRINGING AND SOLAR. AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE HARDER TO REACH COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS THAT I REPRESENT. WHICH ARE AGRICULTURAL REGIONS AND FARM WORKER POPULATION SIGNIFICANTLY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO IS TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ZEROED OUT LIE WITH. THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. AND IT WOULD BE A HUGE CATASTROPHE OF THAT'S NOT REAUTHORIZE FOR THE NEXT UPCOMING FISCAL SIMPLY BECAUSE. YOU GOING IN MY EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH LOW INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE THERE IS NOTHING ON% THE PLATE RIGHT NOW. THAT WILL TAKE ITS PLACE. IF IT GOES AWAY I THINK THAT. AT SOME POINT WILL REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO REENGINEER THE PROGRAM. AND AGAIN WE WORK WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING. YOU KNOW THE PROGRAM ITSELF AS WELL AS ADMINISTERING SERVICES IN JUST THE RESTART UP ALONE WILL WILL LOSE A YEAR. SO AGAIN I WOULD BRING IT TO YOUR ATTENTION. THAT THE REAUTHORIZATION OF Y. WHIP IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK IT SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO. THE ABILITY FOR US AS A STATE AND WE RECOGNIZE. THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF DISCONNECTION IN THE IMPACT SO AGAIN IT'S THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE AT THANK YOU. I WANNA LEARN MORE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND UNDERSTAND TO WHY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. OF PROPOSING THAT BE ZEROED OUT SUB YOU WOULD MIGHT BE IN CONTACT WITH MY STAFF FOR AND PRETZELS THAT UP A MEETING BUT I'D LIKE TO GET MORE INFORMATION AND UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE. A LITTLE MORE. ANGLE MORE GRANULAR THANK ANNUAL THEIR LEVEL. RIGHT AND I'LL I WILL LEAVE MY CONTACT AFFIRMATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENT. ANYONE ELSE. THANK. OF. ALRIGHT TO. SO WERE WERE. AND MOVING ON TO OUR FIRST STEP PANEL. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOURPATIENCE WELCOME CHAIR TING. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY. PLEASE PROCEED. GREAT. OKAY WE CAN START GETS ALRIGHT SO MY NAME IS TYSON ACTUALLY ON THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICEOF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND OUR ROLE RELEASED THE COORDINATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH ALL OF OUR PARTNER AGENCIES. LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND BUSINESSES TO BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. IN THE CONTEXT OF TODAY'S HEARING AND IN RECENT EXECUTIVE ORDER YOU'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A COMPLETE MARKET TRANSPORTATION. I'M NOT JUST INCREMENTAL PROGRESS SO TRANSPORTATION AS WE KNOW. I ACCOUNT FOR THE COST ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR GREENHOUSE GASES AS THE STATE AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE A KEY PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THAT. CONTRIBUTION. I'M FIVE MILLIONS THAT'S WHICH WAS LAID OUT BY THE GOVERNOR IN HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER BY TWENTY THIRTY IS A CHECKPOINT ON THE WAY TO A FULLY ZAB FUTURE. THE REALLY TO GET THERE WE NEED TO FUNDAMENTAL THINGS TO HAPPEN FIRST WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE VERY EXCITED TO BUY. BY PURCHASE OR LEASE OR OPERATE THESE VEHICLES. AND SECOND WE NEED THE ABILITY TO CHARGE IN FUEL THESE VEHICLES CONVENIENTLY. I WANT TALK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTAL TO THEM. TO THE MARKET IS DIRECTLY LINKED A VEHICLE UPDATE I'M HE GETS INTO IT OF A LOT OF WAYS LIKE WHY WOULD YOU BUY A CAR THAT YOU CAN'T FUEL. BUT IT'S ALSO SHOWN IN A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN LOCATIONS THAT HAVE MORE PUBLIC CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY. HAVE A HIGHER UPTAKE OF VEHICLES. AND CALIFORNIA HAPPENS HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST RATIOS. AND THEY DID IT OF ANY MAJOR MARKET. AND TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO NUMBER OF CHARTER SO OUR RATIO IS ABOUT THIRTY ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO ONE PUBLIC CHARTER SO PUBLIC REPLACE CHARGER. AND AS COMPARISON AND OTHER LEADING MARKETS THAT WE COMPARE OURSELVES TO LIKE NORWAY HAS A FIFTEEN TO ONE RATIO AND THE NETHERLANDS HAVE ABOUT A FIVE TO ONE RATIO. SO THE RATE RATIO CAN VARY DEPENDING ON LOCATION IN PARKING AVAILABILITY. BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK CALIFORNIA PROBABLY HAS ONE OF THE BEST UNDERSTANDINGS OF WHAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF THAT RATIOS. AND SO THE CDC HAS RECENTLY COMPLETED THEIR ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN YOUR LONG ROBUST ANALYSIS WORKING AT THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB. TO LOOK FOR A BOTTOM UP HERE LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS LATER. BUT RELIEVED AT THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE CHARGING NEEDS AS THE STATE. IT WAS ORGANIZED AROUND ONE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE pCONSUMERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT DRIVING BEHAVIOR. BASED ON ELECTRICITY. WITH THAT IN MIND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT W. ELEVEN TO ONE RATIO SO. I'M ELEVEN E. VIS TWO ONE CHARGER IN THE PUBLIC SO. WE'VE A LONG WAY TO GO ON THERE HYDROGEN SIDE. DIE WERE FULLY DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT A VIABLE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE HOME CHARGING SOLUTION YET IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO YOU LOOK AT THIS THAT YOU KNOW WHERE ARE WE THAT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IF YOU THROW ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS AT AT AND I'M WITH THE UTILITY INVESTMENTS WITH THE SETTLEMENTS WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S CURRENT PROGRAM WE GET ABOUT HALF WHERE WE NEED HALF OF THE WAY WE. NEED TO GO. OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND SO WITH THIS CHALLENGE IN MIND. GOVERNOR BROWN SET OUT IN THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETS THAT ARE ORGANIZED AROUND THAT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOAL. AND SO TO GET THERE. WE NEED ABOUT TWO AND A FIFTY THOUSAND PUBLIC CHARGERS THAT'S IN THAT PUBLIC SPACE WORKPLACE AND MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. AND INCLUSIVE INCLUDING THERE WE NEED THAT TEN THOUSAND DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGERS ROUNDABOUT TO TO REALLY ENABLE THE MARKET. I WILL SERVE LOOKING AT DOUBLING OUR HYDROGEN COMMITMENTS WE NEED TWO HUNDRED STATIONS THERE UP FROM OUR CURRENT HUNDRED TARGET. WE NEED THESE STATIONS SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE ESPECIALLY WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION THE DISADVANTAGED THAT COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ACCESS THROUGHOUT THEIR. AND SO REALLY THESE YOU KNOW TARGETS AND VISION OF THE GOVERNOR SET OUT ARE HELPFUL IN ORGANIZING THE MARKET YOU KNOW WE THREW THOSE OUT THERE I'M. FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO YOU GIVE IT GIVE US OFTEN MEASURE AGAINST AND ALSO KIND OF SIGNAL TO THE MARKET WHAT WE NEED TO IT TWO REALLY CATALYZED DEVELOPMENT. AYE BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY TALKING YOU KNOW HAS TAKEN THAT VISION AND ACTUALLY PUT INTO ACTION AND TALK ABOUT THE FUNDING TO BACK THAT UP SO THAT WE CAN HEAD OVER TO BATMAN. YEAH AMANDA MARTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE MINISTER THAT HE. A BRIEF OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE TO ACCELERATE CALIFORNIA'S TRANSITION. TO THE BEES. CONSISTING OF TWO PRIMARY COMPONENTS. ACCELERATE DEPLOYMENT OF STEVIE INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S ALTERNATIVE RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM THE ACKERMAN IS A ARE AT THE TPE. AND ONGOING FOR FUNDING FOR VEHICLE REBATES THEM AS OUTLINED IN YOUR AGENDA. PROPOSAL FOR THEIR MISSION PROGRAM. INCLUDES NINE HUNDRED MILLION OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND NINETY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY I'M IN THE REMAINING YEARS NOW IN ORDER TO DO THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE PROGRAM EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE PROPOSED INCLUDES BOTH BUDGET BILL ON TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO APPROPRIATE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION FROM THE ALTERNATIVE AND RENEWABLE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY FUND. I'M FOR THOSE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE WHICH INCLUDES SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION FROM THE VARIOUS I'M AB ONE EIGHTEEN PROGRAMS A TRANSFER OF FIFTEEN MILLION. FROM THE AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FUND FUND BALANCE AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION OF THE REMAINING FUND BOUNCE. IT ALSO AUTHORIZES THE TRANSFER. OF ENCUMBERED FUNDS OF APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION FROM THAT NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THAT'S ENDING THIS YEAR. AND LIFTS THE TWENTY MILLION OR TWENTY PERCENT LIMIT ON ANNUAL EXPENDITURES ON HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS THAT'S CURRENTLY COULD THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S PROGRAM. NOT FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ONGOING. PRISON ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT WHICH PROVIDES CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. WITH REBATES ON THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF NEW LIGHT DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AND PLUG IN HYBRIDS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S TO UNDERMINE FROM CAP AND TRADE FUNDS ANNUALLY. THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE MILLION SPECIFICALLY FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. THE ONGOING FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY. THE CONSUMERS AND MANUFACTURERS IN THAT MARKET I'M AND WITH THAT WE TURN OVER TO SEE YOU SEE AN AIRPORT TO OPERATE ON THEIR PROPOSALS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS TRUE BONE AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND AS YOU HEARD ON I CAN REPEAT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD BUT WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE OF THINGS WE'VE GOT TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH. THIS PROGRAM AND WE THINK WE KNOW WHAT THE PLAYERS WHO THE PLAYERS ARE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO. AS. YOU HEARD EARLIER WE SPENT THE LAST YEAR WORKING WITH AND WELL THE NATIONAL RENEWABLE ENERGY LAB IN COLORADO AND OUR STAFF TO DEVELOP A. TOOL WE CALL E. V. I PRO AND THAT STANDS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTIONS. THIS LITTLE REVIEWS TO COME UP WITH THESE NUMBERS SO WHEN WE SAY WE ESTIMATE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS TEN THOUSAND OF WHICH WOULD BE FAST CHARGERS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS. OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS IS WHERE THESE NUMBERS COME FROM AND IS TYSON POINTED OUT WERE OUR EXPECTATION IS TO IT IS THAT. WITH THE INVESTMENTS WERE CURRENTLY SEEING ON THE HORIZON. HALF MAYBE LESS THAN THAT WE THINK WE HAVE CURRENTLY FUNDED SO THE NUMBERS YOU HEARD FROM FINANCE ARE THE NUMBERS WE THINK WE NEED TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT. AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BY MOVING FROM PLACE TO PLACE FOR FOR THE LAST CENTURY. AND. WITHOUT PUBLIC INVESTMENT WE DON'T SEE THE UPTICK UPTAKE BEING ABOUT WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE. BRIEFLY ON HYDROGEN WERE IT OVER FOUR THOUSAND VEHICLES RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT THIRTY TWO STATIONS FUNDED. IN IN PLACE IN AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET. GOD THE PROPER THAT THE HYDROGEN THAT THEY NEED AND WE'VE GOT ANOTHER ABOUT THIRTY THAT ARE FUNDED IN ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING BUILT. AND WE HAVE FUNDING IN PLACE FOR THE BALANCE OF THE HUNDRED THAT WE'VE BEEN AFTER FOR QUITE SOMETIME AND AS YOU'RE AWARE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL SEEKS TO DOUBLE THAT NUMBER TWO HUNDRED. OUGHT TO REALLY BEFORE AND HYGIENE WITH THAT ALL. PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE. I GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M STEEP CLIFF DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AS YOU HEARD WE'RE REQUESTING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO. SUPPORT THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROJECT OR CV RP. WHICH INCLUDES AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE MILLION ANNUALLY FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. THESE CAN THESE INCENTIVES ARE A KEY PART OF OUR MULTI PRONGED EFFORT. TO GROW THIS AT MARKET. AND HELP MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS AND AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. THE PRIMARY DRIVER IS OUR ADVANCE CLEAN CARS PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES A ZEV REGULATION REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA. VEHICLE IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND SENATE SUPPORT THE REGULATION AND NINE OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED THIS OF REGULATION BUT NONE HAS SEEN THE MARKET GROWTH CALIFORNIA HOUSE DUE IN LARGE PART TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE INVESTMENTS HERE. VEHICLE PURCHASE INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE MARKET TO HELP BRIDGE THE HIGHER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. AND TO HELP CONSUMERS BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THESE INCENTIVES ALSO ENCOURAGE SALES BEYOND THE MINIMUMS REQUIRED BY THE REGULATION. TO FURTHER ACCELERATE THE MARKET. THIS IS NEEDED TO MEET THE FIVE MILLIONS OF GOAL THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. EARLY SIGNS OF MARKET GROWTH A VERY PROMISING WITH OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSANDS ADS ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA. AND OVER FORTY VEHICLE MODELS NOW AVAILABLE. ZEV SALES GREW TO FIVE PERCENT IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. AND BUT WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THAT MARKET IS FULLY SINGLE. WE'VE SEEN THIS AT MARKET AND OTHER STATES COLLAPSE WHEN THOSE INCENTIVES HAVE. BEEN ENDED TOO SOON. AND DESPITE THIS POSITIVE NEWS PREDICTABLE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THE C. B. R. P. HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE. WE'VE STRUGGLED TO KEEP THE PROGRAM FULLY FUNDED. ENDING UP WITH WAITING LISTS IN FOUR OF THE PAST. PAST FIVE YEARS. AND THE STARTS AND STOPS HAVE HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE MARKET A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SEEK YOUR P. ANNUAL APPROPRIATION. WOULD PROVIDE CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET AND HELP US CHART A LONG TERM COURSE FOR C. B. R. P.. WE EXPECT THIS FUNDING WOULD MEET CONSUMER DEMAND FOR IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN FUNDING CYCLE SO WE WOULDN'T ENVISION ANY MAJOR CHANGES OVER THE NEXT YEAR. AS THE MARKET GROWS WILL NEED TO CONTINUE REFINING THE CVR P. TARGET. AT TO TARGET THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO THE CONSUMERS MOST INFLUENCED BY THESE REBATES. AND THAT COULD. BE CHANGES TO THE REQUIREMENTSTHAT MIGHT INCLUDE. OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SUCH AS MSRP CAPS OR OTHER TYPES OF THEM. I LIMITS TO THE PROGRAM TO STAY WITHIN THAT TO HONOR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET AND OF COURSE WE WOULD DO ANY OF THAT THROUGH OUT OF PUBLIC PROCESS LIKE WE DO FOR OUR EXISTING PROGRAM. I FOCUS ON THE VEHICLE INCENTIVE SIDE BUT THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ONLY FULLY EFFECTIVE IF THEY'RE DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION P. YOU SEE AND GO BEARS TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S SEVEN VESTMENTS STRATEGY AS WELL COORDINATED. AND THEN IN ADDITION. THERE'S OTHER ELEMENTS OF OUR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS THAT ALSO SUPPORT THIS APP INITIATIVE. WE FUND CLEAN TRUCKS BUSES AND FREIGHT EQUIPMENT TO INTRODUCE OUR MISSION TECHNOLOGIES TO THOSE SECTORS. AND WE INVEST IN EQUITY FOCUS PROJECTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS BENEFIT FROM ZERO EMISSION TECHNO. YEAH. THANK YOU. ILIO. ON THE NEXT THE CANNOT. OKAY. IT JUST ENJOYING THIS ONE. SO. AYE MY FAMILY'S RECENTLY BECOME ONE OF THE FOUR THOUSAND. OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLE. AND I WANTED TO JUST OUT A COUPLE OF. CONSUMER COMMENTS. A ABOUT THE FUELING STATIONS WHICH I I HAVE TO SAY A ON THE WHOLE. NOT MANY I FOUND TO BE. LACKING IN AND. A A NUMBER OF ASPECTS. OF A FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE STATIONS HAVE EXTREMELY POOR LIGHTING. OF WHERE THE HYDROGEN FUEL. SELF A PUMP IS LOCATED A AND THE LEADING TO A LESS THAN INVITING CA A AND ENVIRONMENT. THERE ARE SOME THE DESIGN ISSUES THAT I'VE NOTICED WHICH A. A MAKES THEM. DIFFICULT ACCESS BUT THE THAT THE BIGGEST ISSUE THAT I. SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE'S NO SIGNAGE NO STREET SIGNAGE INDICATING THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. A. HYDROGEN OF FUEL IS AVAILABLE NOW. AS DRIVERS WE KNOW WHERE THE STATIONS ARE BECAUSE THERE'S AN APP THAT THAT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS. BUT IT SEEMED TO ME THAT OF THE LACK OF SIGNAGE BUTTON THIS IS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT THIS IS THE FUEL. THAT IS BECOMING MORE UBIQUITOUS AND AVAILABLE. AND IF WE'RE GONNA. TRULY BE SUCCESSFUL IN MOVING THIS PROGRAM FORWARD AND A INVEST VERY SUBSTANTIAL. UP WE SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF FULLER. UP OVERALL HOW WE DESIGNED AND. A INDICATE TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THAT THE STATIONS EVEN EXIST. THOSE ARE EXCELLENT POINTS CHAIRED THE UNIVERSE OF UP PROVIDERS OF THIS TECHNOLOGY IS VERY SMALL AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH EACH OF THEM SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE COMMENTS BACK AND SHARE THEM WITH. THOSE FOLKS AND I BUT I THINK THEY'RE VERY GOOD SUGGESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO BE MORE SPECIFIC WITH YOU IN A PRIVATE MEETING BUT I CAN'T LIKE NOT TRYING TO CALL ANYBODY SPECIFICALLY OUT HERE. BUT THE IT THE ISSUE OF SIGNAGE. A IS ACROSS THE BOARD I. AT AND AND I HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO THAT MANY STATIONS. AT AT THIS POINT WE'VE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT TO THREE MONTHS NOW. BUT THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE STATION WHERE THE HAS BEEN SIGNAGE. SO TO ME THAT I IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S. THERE MUST BE A REASON FOR THAT AND WE OUGHT TO BE. FIGURING OUT HOW TO OVERCOME THAT. ANY OTHER. MR MON. OTHERWISE EXPERIENCES BEEN GREAT BY THE WAY UP. I HAVE A QUICK VIEW THAT JUST A FEW QUESTIONS. IN TERMS OF. IDENTIFYING WHERE THESE CHARGING STATIONS CHO HAU MCCARTY YEARS BEING USE. WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE SPECIFIC AREAS ARE FOCUSING ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE? SO I THINK THEY. THERE'S A COUPLE IT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS HAPPEN THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY SO WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAM. THEY PUT OUT FUNDING AND THEN THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY THEY THEN SHE PARTNERS LIKE DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT LOCATION. THERE'S A THAT PUSH AND PULL AND BACK AND FORTH WITH THE STATE AGENCY THROUGH THE PUBLIC PROCESS KIND OF WHERE THE MONEY NEEDS TO GO. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION YOU KNOW THAT I'M WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE UTILITIES AND THE UTILITIES IN TURN WERE CLOSE WITH THE COMMUNITIES TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY NEED TO PUT THAT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL SO. ALL OF US ARE TALKING IN COORDINATION ABOUT FILLING GAPS THAT BEAR BE IS OVERSEEING THE VW SETTLEMENT INVESTMENTS AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ELECTRIFY AMERICA. TO HELP BOTH IDENTIFY SITES FACILITY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEM BUT ALSO. FIND LOCATIONS THAT WORK SO THERE'S IT'S IT'S A WHOLE ECOSYSTEM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TALKING AND RELIEF TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE BEST SITES FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS AND ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC INVESTMENTS. I I WOULD JUST ADD TWO POINTS ONE OF SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE REALLY EMBRACED THIS CHANGE AND HAVE THEMSELVES INVESTED FUNDS ARE RECEIVED PUBLIC FUNDS. TO HELP THEM DO SO TO PLAN WERE GONNA PUT THIS. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN SECOND THE TOOL I DESCRIBED EARLIER THIS EVEY I PRO TOOL IDENTIFIES PLACES IT'S IT'S NOT A MAGIC PILL BUT IDENTIFIES PLACES WHERE THE BEST INFRASTRUCTURE. SUITS THE LOCATION SO YOU HAVE THESE DC FAST CHARGER IS THAT WILL GIVE YOU A. EIGHTY PERCENT CHARGE IN TWENTY MINUTES OR SO IT BUT A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE SUITE ONE PUT THOSE IN A LOT OF PLACES WHERE PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE AT WORK IN THEIR CAR CAN SITTHERE FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THEY HAVE A VERY FAST CHARGER. PUTTING CORRIDORS SALE WAY TO VEGAS ARE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO GO LONGER DISTANCES THAT I WANT TO SIT FOR THREE HOURS TO GET ENOUGH CHARGE TO GET TO THE HOTEL OR WHEREVER THEIR DESTINATION IS SO. WE'VE OR MAKING THOSE DECISIONS VERY DYNAMICALLY AND WERE LEARN AN AWFUL LOT AS WE GO FORWARD. I. APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS THE CHALLENGES THEY HAVE IF THE INVESTMENTS ARE GOING SAY FOR EXAMPLE INTO. IN THE BAY AREA AND TO SAN DIEGO AND YOU'RE LEAVING THEIR THE MIDDLE PART OF THE STATE. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF A NOT INVESTING AND CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE IT. A DISPROPORTIONATE. YOU KNOW. BUT I GUESS NON USAGE OF THE TECHNOLOGY IF PEOPLE CAN GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. UP IN TERMS OF THE THE REBATES OUT WHAT IS THE CURRENT REBATE NOW AND WHAT DO YOU. DEBATED IT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE TO REACH EVER EVER EVER. SIGNIFICANT GOAL OF FIVE MILLION. ZEDS ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY. YEP THANK YOU AT THE CURRENT REBATE FOR A FULL BATTERY ELECTRIC. VEHICLE IS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IT'S FIVE THOUSAND FOUR A HYDROGEN FUEL CELL. VEHICLE IT SAID FIFTEEN HUNDRED FOR A PLUGIN HYBRID VEHICLE AND NINE HUNDRED FOR ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE. A IN TERMS OF I'M WHAT IT TAKES TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL WE'VE LAID OUT A PLAN. TO GET US THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF INCENTIVE IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT IT TAKES TO BUILD THAT SUSTAINABLE MARKET. THAT IN COMBINATION WITH REQUIREMENTS ON MANUFACTURERS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE VEHICLES ARE BEING MADE. AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. SO THAT THERE'S KIND OF GENERAL. PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AT DOING FOR THE ABILITY TO REFUEL. A IN ADDITION THIS ISN'T THE ONLY PIECE OF. WHAT'S NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET THE TECHNOLOGY OUT IN THE MARKET WE NEED TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORTS. TO INCREASE CONSUMER AWARENESS AND EDUCATION ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING EVENTS SUCH AS WRITING DRIVES WHERE YOU CAN JUST GET PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLES. LET THEM EXPERIENCE THEM I GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT THEM THE TYPES OF VEHICLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SHOW THEM THAT THOSE VEHICLES CAN MEET THEIR NEEDS AND THAT THEY'RE FUN TO DRIVE. DONE A IN TERMS OF THE PLAN WHAT DO YOU DO ANTICIPATED AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE. THE REBATE AT THE SUBSIDY. I KNOW WE DON'T EXPECT ANY CHANGES SINCE SO YOU EXPECTED THE STATE. BUT THE TWENTY FIVE FIVE THOUSAND FIFTEEN HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS LEVEL. THAT'S RIGHT FOR THAT FOR THE NEAR TERM. IN THE LONG TERM WILL HAVE TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGES. BUT IT THIS TIME THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT. IN DIFFERENCE THE CHAIR UP A WHAT IS THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A OF A ZEV. NOT NOT OWNING ONE MYSELF. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE PRICES BUT IT YOU KNOW CAN GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I AM THE THE THE LEAF WHICH IS KIND OF A WELL KNOWN. AS THEIR MISSION VEHICLE IS IN THE THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. COURSE YOU KNOW OPTIONS DEPENDING CAN BE MORE OR LESS% THAN THAT. AND AND NOT SO A FAIRLY TYPICAL ONE THEIR LEASE PRICES. THAT CAN ACTUALLY BE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE UNDER TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND THEN OF COURSE IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME CONSUMER OR MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR. I'M GETTING THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF REBATES. THEN. THOSE LEASE RATES CAN GO DOWN QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY SO I JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THERE'S AT THAT IS OUR SLIDING SCALE FOR THE REBATE IN TERMS OF. FOR LOW INCOME TO BADLY RIGHT GAFFER LOW INCOME THERE'S A THAT THERE'S SOME THRESHOLD QUESTIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE SATISFIED BUT THERE IS A HIGHER REBATE THAT SO TEN WHAT WOULD THAT BE BABY I THINK. TO US ARE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS HIGHER. IT WAS A LEAD FOR AT FIVE HUNDRED WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND. TODAY ADDRESS A INFRASTRUCTURE GAPPING TO IT OBJECTIVE WITH JUST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IF I THINK BY THIS PROPOSAL'S ACTIVE DRIVE MONEY AND FILL THE GAPS YOU'RE MENTIONING SO WHERE. WE DON'T HAVE HAPPEN IS IS THE DEEP PENETRATION IN THE COURT MARKETS AND NOT HAVE IT SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE REST THE STATE'S THAT'S REALLY HAD A FUNDAMENTAL TODAY WITH. THE WAY OF THINKING OR DOING THAT BOTH IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT BUT ALSO. WITH BUILDING SANDERS TO RAISING THE MINIMUM BUILDING CENTER THRESHOLD FOR NEW BUILDINGS HAVE EVEY CABLES LOW SHERIDAN'S BUILT INTO THAT SURE WE OBVIOUSLY WANT PEOPLE TO DRIVE TO BAKERSFIELD SO EXACTLY NEEDED TO. OPPONENTS. THINK WE SURE THANK YOU ALL FOR THE PRESENTATION. I THINK THE WORD THAT WAS USED WAS ECOSYSTEM LOTS OF DIFFERENT PARTIES INVOLVED HERE. AND LA ARISTA CONCERNED JUST ABOUT THE OVERALL COORDINATION HERE SO IS IS THE MONEY THE TWO THIRTY FIVE IN THIS IS A. STANGEL INVESTMENT OVER TIME IS A TO THIRTY FIVE GOING TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION WILL BE. SORT OF AT THE CENTER OF THIS HUB IF YOU WILL. IN TERMS OF COORDINATION JUST THAT AFFIRMATION THAT THAT THAT'S ACCURATE AND THEN IN TERMS OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY MEET THESE METRICS UP OVER TIME I MEAN I FULLY SUPPORT WE NEED BE BUILDING OUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THE QUESTION IS. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE WE GETTING FOR THAT TO THIRTY FIVE AND AND ARE WE ACTUALLY. MEETING OUR BENCHMARK SO CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THE CORONATION. AND THE AND THE. AND THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR SUCCESS HERE BUILDING OUT THIS INDUSTRY. AND SO MAYBE IF THIS ON THE COORDINATION LIKE WE'RE ALL WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS AT THE PRINCIPAL LEVEL AND AT THE STAFF LEVEL. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE EXECUTIVE ORDER ICTATES IS HAVING UPDATING THERE'S YOUR MACHINE LEGAL ACTION PLAN. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF IT ACTIONS AT ALL THE AGENCIES TAKE TO MAKE THIS MARKET HAPPENED I THINK IN TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT THOUGH THE REALLY THE. HUB OF THIS OVER TALKING AT THAT UNIT THIRTY FIVE IN THE CONTINUING ALLOCATION IS THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND YOU MAY BEGIN TALK ABOUT YOUR PROCESS OF. ANNUAL UPDATES AND. DISCUSS YOUR WE WE DO WHAT WE DO REGULAR ANNUAL UPDATES WITH ALL THESE STATISTICS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE SENSE OF COSTS WHICH WILL TRANSLATE INTO WHAT YOU GET FOR AN INVESTMENT OF TURNER THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAVEN'T FINALIZED EXACTLY HOW WE THINK IT'S BEST PARSED OUT IT DEPENDS IN PART ON READINESS OF SAY THE HYDROGEN FOLKS AND AND A LOT OF FACTUAL OR LOOKING AT THAT VERY CLOSELY RIGHT NOW. BUT TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE PRICES VERY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS JUST LIKE THE VEHICLES THEMSELVES THE COSTS ARE GOING DOWN BUT TODAY A ROUGH COST OF A WHAT WE CALL A LEVEL TWO CHARGER WHICH IS LIKE TO TWENTY WHAT RUNS YOUR DRYER AT HOME. IS ABOUT IN THE FIVE TO SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. THE LEVEL TWO CHARTERS THAT DELIVER MUCH MORE POWER MUCH MORE QUICKLY CLOSE TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO AGAIN OUR OUR PROPOSAL IS TO BALANCE THE BULK OF THE CHARGERS BEING LEVEL TWO. BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER. BUT MAKING SURE WE CITE SOME OF THESE. THESE TO FAST CHARGERS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND OF MISS THE GOAL OUT OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE PLACES WHERE IT REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO SO BUT WHAT WILL EACH YEAR TRUE THESE UP AND BE ABLE TO REFLECT WHAT. WHAT THE IN INVESTMENT BOUGHT A HOUSE AND A WHAT THE TARGET STILL LOOK LIKE? IN THIS MAYBE FATE THE EVF PRO THAT WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE GIVES US IN ONE OF THE. NEWEST AND MOST EXCITING TOOL SEXY TRACK PROGRESS SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WHERE THE VESSELS ARE GOING HOW THE MARKET'S BEEN RESPONDING HAS LOTS OF VARIABLES THAT CAN THROW AT IT ACTUALLY. REFINED AS WE GO THROUGH TIME AND I THINK THAT'S ON THE PLUGIN CHARGING SIDE AND ON THE HYDROGEN SIDE THERE'S THAT A RESOURCES BOARD HAS IT THAT COUPLE OF. PARTNER MODELS THAT. CULTURE IN CHAT CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL THAT CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN ASSESSMENT TOOL IT'S KIND OF FUN PLAY. BUT SO THAT THEY WORK TOGETHER VERY WELL CHEATING CHATTING. BUT THAT I'M. AND THE IDEA OF THEIR TWO IS ALSO THE IT'S IT'S ALL BASED ON TRAVEL LIKE WHERE WHERE PEOPLE GOING TO HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING TO THESE INVESTMENTS AND SO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE BEING STRATEGIC AND INTER INTER OF ABOUT THE PROCESS OF PREPARING A LOT AS WE GO ALONG. I'VE IT'S POINTING OUT THAT ACTUALLY. THE MECHANISM THIS PROGRAM IT'S NOT LIKE THE URGE COMMISIONS GONNA PUT OUT ONE SOLICITATION FOR TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION. THE EXISTING PROGRAM PUTS OUT MULTIPLES WITH HAITIANS THERE'S A WHOLE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS BETWEEN THE TIME THEY RELEASE THEIR DRAFT PLAN AND FINALIZE PLAN. WHICH ALLOWS THE DIFFERENT SOLICITATIONS TO BE TARGETED TO SPECIFIC. ISSUES OR AREAS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND SO I'M WE ARE ADDRESSING THE GAPS ALSO THAT WHICH. ALSO INCLUDES STAKEHOLDER INPUT. SURE EVELYN. JUST ONE QUESTION THAT POPPED IN MY HEAD I'M. IN TERMS OF IF WE IF WE DO COME CLOSER AS WEEK PROGRESSED TO. POTENTIALLY REACHING THIS GOAL WHAT IS THE IMPACT A AT THAT FROM THAT PART FINANCE IN TERMS OF THAT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE BECAUSE IT OF COURSE. HE'S VEHICLES DON'T PAY A GAS TAX SO WHAT IS THE IMPACT THE TO IN TERMS OF THAT. A METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES. AT THE MARGIN. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT. IF THERE'S A SUBSTITUTION A FACT. WHERE? PETROLEUM BASED VEHICLES ARE. SHIFTED TO MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES THERE WOULD BE LE LET'S REVENUE THERE BUT. THAT WOULD BE REFLECTED IN. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS OVER TIME. ASSOCIATE WITH THE GAS TAX AND. WE. IT IT WOULD BE. ADJUST ACCORDINGLY AS THE YEARS GO ON I GUESS WHAT I WOULD. WHEN I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT EVEN. UNDER. THESE TARGETS IT WOULD STILL BE A SIGNIFICANT YOU KNOW NUMBER OF. CARS THAT WOULD STILL BE USING GASOLINE TOO SO IT'S IT'S A LONG TERM. MOVING THE NEEDLE DO YOU HAVE ANY PROJECTIONS AND IN TERMS OF. IT FIVE MILLION. ZEDS ARE ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY GMT PROTECTIONS OF WHAT THAT WOULD BE OVER TIME BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP. I THINK I THINK THAT THE LARGER CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE MORE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THAT. THAT WE OUT CLEARLY MORE MILES POTENTIALLY BEING DRIVEN LESS MONEY COMING IN FOR ROADS AND THEN OF COURSE. SINCE THE GAS TAX IS REGRESSIVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT THAT FALL THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE STILL PAYING THE GAS TAX ARE GOING BEYOND THE LOW INCOME SCALE. WE HAVE ABOUT THAT I JUST SHY I THINK OF ABOUT THIRTY MILLION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES SO IF YOU FIGURE WE SUCCEED IN GET A FIVE BY TWENTY THIRTY. MAYBE THAN THE GRAND TOTAL WILL BE LARGER BUT GIVE YOU SOME SENSE OF THE PERCENTAGE IN WHAT WHAT THE IMPACT MIGHT BE BUT SURE ARE FOR SIZE WHY I WOULD GUESS THAT YOUR PUBLIC PLANNING FOR SOME EXPONENTIAL GROWTH. WHICH MEANS THAT WILL HAVE AN EXPONENTIAL REDUCTION IN GAS TAX REVENUE. BUT THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEAN BEFORE YOU. LEAVE THOUGH. WE'RE GONNA TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF PANEL THREE. BUT I'D ASK THAT YOU STICK AROUND A TO HEAR THE PUBLIC COMMENT BUT BE. I MISTER TANK CHAIR TING IS PLANNING ON RETURNING IN JUST A FEW MINUTES AND I THINK MY UNDERSTANDING IS HE HAS SOME QUESTIONS. POSSIBLY FOR ALL THREE PANELS LE BUT TO HAVE. DEFINITELY FOR YOURS. TO WILL PROCEED NOW WITH PANEL TO WELCOME. PLEASE PROCEED. BUT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS I'M RUN LENDERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. BUT DURING OUR COMMENTS ALL BE REFERRING TO SOME FIGURES FROM ARE A RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. REPORT WHICH SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO YOU UP BY THE SERGEANT OF THE SECTION. ON THIS PROPOSAL BEGINS ON PAGE SIXTY ONE OF THAT REPORT. SO IT BECAME A THING ARE OUR MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE CAR TO. OUR COMMENTS ON THE ADMINISTRATION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE OR ZEV INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL ARE TWO. EPISODES OF THIS PROPOSAL REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN FUNDING AND THE FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR VARIOUS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND AIR QUALITY RELATED PROGRAMS THAT RAISES IMPORTANT POLICY QUESTIONS. TO HIGHLIGHT ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSALS. IMPLEMENTATION IN COORDINATION WITH OTHER SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT WE BELIEVE LEGISLATURE. WELL WHAT'S A TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT THE HIGHLIGHTS. FOR CONSIDERATION WHETHER. KEY COMPONENTS OF THE. A PROPOSAL LINE WOULD LOOK WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. UP BASED ON THOSE OBJECTIVES WE HAVE THREE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE WITH REGARD TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. UP FIRST WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO ENABLE. A IT TO PROPERLY EVALUATE THE MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL SECOND. OUT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATION TO A DEVELOP A MORE DETAILED STRATEGY FOR SPENDING. UP RECORDING SPENDING FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS. AND A THIRD WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER A WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO USE VARIOUS SPECIAL FUNDS AND RICK PARA FUNDS TO SUPPORT. AYE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS OWN PRIORITIES. WITH REGARD TO OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION A SPECIFICALLY RURAL RECOMMENDED. TO THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT IT REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW FUNDING WOULD AFFECT KEY POLICY OUTCOMES. US SUCH IS THE GUY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION LEVELS. OUR IT'S ASSESSMENT THE POTENTIAL RISKS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSTANTIAL EXPANSIVE THERE HAVE. A MORE DETAILED JUSTIFICATION FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING REQUESTED FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. A PLAN FOR. EVALUATING. THE OUTCOMES AFTER PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BEGINS. WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RAISES KEY POLICY QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER BEFORE ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. US SUCH AS THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS TYPE OF INITIATIVE. COMPARED TO OTHER EMISSION REDUCTIONS PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY GIVEN. BUT THIS PROPOSAL IS DIRECTED AT AND MISS THE SOURCE WHICH IS CURRENTLY. COVERED UNDER THE STATE'S CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT ARE THE PROPOSALS ASSOCIATED RISKS AND POSSIBLE MITIGATION POLICIES AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN JOBS% COULD. SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GAS TAX REVENUE. OR LEAD TO CHALLENGES FOR GRID OPERATORS. TRYING TO BALANCE THE GRID. DEPENDING ON WHEN. ELECTRIC ZEV OWNERS CHARTS THEIR VEHICLES. A WE NOTE THAT THE MUSIC ENERGY COMMISSION HAS SINCE. VERY RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTIONS THAT DOES DISCUSS SOME. OF THE TYPES OF INFORMATION RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE OBTAIN THIS INCLUDES. DETAILS ON THE METHODS DATA AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN ITS GAP ANALYSIS. HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON A. FIGURE TWENTY THREE UNPAID SIXTY FIVE OF A REPORT. OUT WHICH IS THE BASIS FOR ITS ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REQUIRED I'D SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED PUBLIC FUNDING. AS WELL AS ITS PLANS FOR EVALUATING PROGRAM OUTCOMES. PUNT IMPLEMENTATION. WELL WE HAVE NOT YET HAD A CHANCE TO THAT CLOSED EXAMINED THIS RECENTLY RELEASED REPORT HOW WE WRECKED WE WELCOME THAT THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND ANY FURTHER INSIDE IT CAN PROVIDE TO THE LEGISLATURE ON. OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU POSED. WITH REGARD TO A SECOND RECOMMENDATION WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION. DOESN'T HAVE A OVER ARCHING STRATEGY FOR CORDONING SPENDING FOR VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS. IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE OF FIGURE TWENTY ONE ON PAGE SIXTY TWO OF OUR REPORT. I IT SHOWS THAT THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS A WIDE ARRAY OBSERVE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS WITH BUDGETS RANGING IN THE LOW MILLIONS TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND FACILITATED BY SEVERAL DIFFERENT AGENCIES. ARE WE RECKON REMOVED RECOGNIZE THAT ARE THE PRIMARY AGENCIES INVOLVED HAVE INCREASED EFFORTS. TO COMMUNICATE THEIR INDIVIDUAL. EFFORTS. HOWEVER GIVEN THE MASSIVE MULTI AGENCY EFFORT WE BELIEVE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DETAILED PLAN AND ESTABLISHED SYSTEM OF OVERALL ACCOUNTABILITY ARE DESCRIBING HOW FUNDING FOR VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS WOULD. NOT BE TARGETED TO THE HIGHS PARTY LOCATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OTHER SOURCES THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FUNDING. BUT FINALLY WITH REGARD TO OUR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S. UP PLAN PRIORITISES FUNDING FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OVER OTHER POTENTIAL USES. I FEW COME UP FIGURE TWENTY TO YOU ON PAGE SIXTY THREE OF REPORT SHOWS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL WOULD SHIFT. ALL OF THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR A OUR FPTP ALLOCATION TO. A SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE AND AWAY FROM VEGAS CLEAN VEHICLE UP PROGRAMS THAT CURRENTLY FUNDS. OF WE ALSO KNOW THE PROPOSAL'S SHIFT SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUND BALANCES FROM PEORIA A OUR BTP AND AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FUND. AS WELL AS REDIRECTS UNSPENT RATE PAIR FUNDS FROM OTHER EXPIRING NEW SOLAR HOMES PARTNERSHIP TO THIS INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE. I WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE SHIPS ARE LINED WITH ITS PRIORITIES. OR WHETHER I PREFER IS A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO A FUNDING AT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE. I THIS CONCLUDES OUR REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY. THANK YOU. DOCTOR BROWN. WELCOME THANK YOU THINK THAT THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND AUSTIN BROWN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS POLICY INSTITUTE FOR ENERGY ENVIRONMENT ECONOMY. I'M I'M WHERE I GOT REALLY LIMITED TIME BUT I WANT TO GO THROUGH A BRIEF SUMMARY OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY A MORE THAN A DECADE OF RESEARCH. USE GIVES A BUYER COLLEAGUES ELSEWHERE ON THE NEEDS AND OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH EXACTLY THE SORTS OF PROGRAMS ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. UNTIL START WITH WITH ONE THING WE KNOW FOR ABSOLUTE ABSOLUTE FOR CERTAIN WHICH IS THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO ARGUE HAS GASKELL'S OVERALL OR LONG TO VENUS GASKELL'S WITHOUT. A RAPID. SHIFT HIS ADS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. NOW IT'S IN SEXUAL IT'S AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT. AND THERE'S A STRONG NEED FOR COMPANY POLICIES FOR THESE SORTS OF VEHICLES IN THE TRANSITION PHASE WHICH WHERE WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN RIGHT NOW. AND WITHOUT THOSE ARE TO CUP MANY POLICIES. COMPANIES. I HAVE THE LUXURY OF PROCRASTINATING AND WAITING FOR A FOR LATER TO MEET. TO TO BRING UP CLOSER TO VEHICLES. AND WE DEFTLY WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE SAME KIND OF PROGRESS WE SEE TODAY ABOUT THOSE COMPLEMENTARY POLICIES. IN PRACTICE WHAT WE SEE IS THAT LEADING CITIES IN THE U. ANY I'D STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA AND LEADING COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD THE ONES THAT SUCCEED ACTION HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF POLICIES THEY DON'T USE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. AND THEY DO A WIDER RANGE OF THINGS I'M WORK MY COLLEAGUES AND THE SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT EXTERNAL. NGOS HAVE ASSESSED THE SORTS OF POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND HAVE FOUND AT LEAST FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED. ROUTED TO DIFFERENT AGREES THERE'S PURCHASE INCENTIVES SUCH AS A TAX CREDITS OR REBATES LIKE THAT WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S RECURRING INCENTIVES LIKE ABOUT THAT HOV LANE ACCESS THAT WE HAVE IN MANY MANY OTHERS AS WELL POTENTIAL FOR PARKING INCENTIVES OF SORTS OF RECURRING THINGS THE EXPERIENCE REGULARLY. AND THERE'S REGULATORY MECHANISMS SUCH AS HOW WE HAVE THAT THIS HAVE MADE IN CALIFORNIA HEATHER INCLUDE INCLUDED IN A VEHICLE FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS OVERALL. THERE IS INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT WHICH YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT ARM AND THEN THERE'S AN EDUCATION OUTREACH COMPONENT AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. DE IT IN A MOMENT. WE'VE SEEN MANY OF THESE POLICIES OF ANY USE TO. TO REALLY A STRONG SUCCESS IN CALIFORNIA'S WE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT BEEN AVAILABLE IN COMPLEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT THAT'S IT'S STILL AVAILABLE. THAT'S A STRONG INCENTIVE IT BRINGS THE IS A RESERVES ON THE MARKET DOWN TO AFFORDABILITY FOR A HUGE VARIETY OF PEOPLE ON WHERE THOSE VEHICLES WOULD OTHERWISE BE OUT OF THEIR PRICE RANGE. AND WE'VE SEEN VERY STRONG INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT AND WE DID HEAR THAT THAT. WE HAVEN'T KEPT PACE WITH THE NEED. SO I I. EXPERIENCED THIS MYSELF THIS MORNING I AYE VOTES STUDIED ZAPS FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS A LITTLE BIT AND EVEY ORDER FOR FOR THE LAST YEAR. AND ON MY WAY HERE I FOUND THAT EVERY CHARGING STATION IN THE PARKING STRUCTURE WAS FULL I PICKED THAT I GO TO THAT PARKING STRUCTURE BECAUSE I KNOW THEY HAVE CHARGERS AND OF COURSE THIS NEVER ENOUGH LIKE UP THERE AROUND NINE AND. AND AND ALL ALL BOOKED UP SO YES WE HAVE INSTALLED A TON MORE INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THERE. THEY'RE STILL FALLING BEHIND THE ACTUAL NEEDS THESE VEHICLES ENTER THE MARKET. I'M BUT WE HAVE SEEN PRETTY STRONG CHRISTIAN SALES CERTAINLY WORK WERE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. COMPARE FAVORABLY TO A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TRIED THIS A WORLDWIDE. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE THIS THE THE. SPECIFICS OF THE INCENTIVES WE HAVE I MEAN WE SEE A LOT MORE MODELS AVAILABLE THAT'S A REALLY BIG DEAL HER THERE'S MORE THAT FORTY ALREADY ON THAT'S UP IF YOU GO BACK JUST LIKE BACK IN TWENTY TEN THERE'S ACTUALLY ZERO MODELS AVAILABLE SIXTY INCREDIBLY RAPID SHIFT. I'M IN JUST THE LAST THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I WOULD HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO STILL SO THOSE MODELS ARE STILL DISPROPORTIONATELY SMALL VEHICLES AND SEDANS WE DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE VEHICLES AND OTHER TYPES. AND WE REALLY NEED TO SEE THAT SHIFT. I'M STUDIES OF DEALERSHIPS FINDS THAT BIT MOST DEALERSHIPS DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ZEV THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED BE SELLING IF THEY DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM THEY KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO SELL THEM TO CONSUMERS AND SIR SECRET SHOPPER APPROACHES HAVE SHOWN THAT. THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF VERY FEW DEALERS REALLY HAVE THE TOOLS AND WILLINGNESS TO TRY TO ACTUALLY SELL THESE VEHICLES TO PEOPLE. AND THEN MAYBE THE MOST SOBERING FINDING OF THE LAST YEAR OF OUR RESEARCH. IS THAT SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN TO BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN PUBLIC AWARENESS AMONG TALK ABOUT ATTITUDES BUT AWARENESS OF ZAPS THE AVAILABILITY OF OF. ELECTRIC VEHICLES HYDROGELS OF VEHICLES HASN'T BUDGED NOTHING MOVED AN INCH WE FIND THAT WHEN WE SURVEYED PEOPLE WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT VERY SIMPLE STUFF LIKE. CAN YOU NAME THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE WHAT'S FOR SALE TODAY. OF THOSE NUMBERS IT DIDN'T MOVE AT ALL. AND THAT PUTS US TO AN ENORMOUS AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT GAP PEOPLE DON'T GO INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOOT FROM THE BY LARGE ANDSAY I NEED TO BUY AND YOU WHAT IF YOU GOT. LEGAL WHEN LOOKING FOR A VEHICLE THAT MEETS THEIR NEEDS THAT MEETS THE SIZE THE CHARACTERISTICS THE PERFORMANCE STYLETHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND THAT IF THEIR WARES OBSERVER OPTION AT WORK THEY'RE INFORMED OF THAT BY THEIR DEALER WHICH AS WE HEARD THE THEY REALLY ARE. THEN MAYBE THEY WILL CONSIDER ONE. SO THIS AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT PIECE IS AN ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT THAT WE STILL SEEM TO BE MISSING. THE NUMBERS ARE VERY LOW EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THE I INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENGAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE YET TO. TO HELP THOSE NUMBERS GROW. SO IF THERE IS ONE SORT OF BIG ITS INGREDIENTS I WOULD SAY IT'S ON THAT ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH PIECE WE NEED SOME SORT OF A. A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO GET THIS SORT OF INFORMATION INTO INTO PEOPLE'S HANDS WE FIND THAT ONCE PEOPLE ROT ONE PUPIL RIDING OR DRIVE YOU VIEWS THEY HAVE VERY POSITIVE ATTITUDES THEY APPRECIATE THE PERFORMANCE. A ZEV OWNERS SUPPORT VERY HIGH SATISFACTION IN PART BECAUSE THEY GET TO DO THINGS LIKE NEVER GO TO THE GAS STATION WHICH IS THAT WHICH IS GREAT PRIVILEGE AND REFILL AT HOME OR AT WORK. BUT THE. pGETTING BEYOND THE EARLY MARKET THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR ON IT IS THAT IS A PRETTY SOBER AND ONE AND ONE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY. FROM THAT AND AND THINKING REALLY RETHINKING IN A DRAMATIC WAY WHAT ARE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ARE AND I THINK ASSEMBLY POSITIVE STEPS. IN THE PROPOSAL THAT THAT'S HERE OF GOING BIGGER REALLY DOING MORE CONCERTED EFFORTS THINKING ABOUT ISSUES LIKE LIKE HAD WE DECIDED HOW TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF IT. I CAN I CAN SAY IS THAT AS THAT YOU'RE THAT'S IT'S STILL AN ISSUE FOR E. VIS AS WELL AS I'M SURE IT IS FOR FOR FREE FOR FUEL CELL VEHICLES. I'M GETTING THE DATE OUT THERE SEE PEOPLE KNOW ARE THESE. CHARGING STATIONS AVAILABLE ARE THEY WORKING WHAT KIND OF CHARGING RATE WILL EXPECT AND HOW MUCH WILL I PAY THIS INFORMATION IS CURRENTLY REALLY HARD FIGHT YET WE SOLD A LOT OF WORK TO DO. BUT THE THE RESEARCH UP IN FIRST RIGHT THINK WE ALL KNOW WHICH IS THAT WERE WERE DOING A LOT OF THINGS RIGHT AND REALLY MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS. SO FAR. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE NICE. TREVAN. I IN TERMS OF. TODAY LEO IN TERMS OF THE COORDINATED STRATEGY. OR LACK THERE OF AT THE CURRENT MOMENT WHAT AND WHAT VALUE DO YOU RECOMMEND IS. THEY FEATHER BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE IN TERMS OF COORDINATION OR HAD HAD IT HAD IMPROVED. THAT COORDINATION. RIGHT. AS AS PREVIOUS MONTH AND THE ADMINISTRATION DOES OBSERVE ACTION PLAN AND THAT. DOES LAY OUT OF IT QUICKLY A LOT OF THE. HIGHER LEVEL TASKS AND CONVERT ADMINISTRATIVE ROLES OF THESE. OF. WE WOULD LIKE SEIZE. PERHAPS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT DIRECTLY TARGETS THE THE SPENDING AND ALSO. PLACES MAYBE PREPS MORE VIA. BURDEN OF ACCOUNTABILITY ANA. OVER ARCHING ENTITY RATHER. OTHER WE DO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A LOT OF TALK AND A LOT OF. KIND OF SHARING OF INFORMATION WOULD BE. PREPS HELPFUL TO HAVE. AND OVER ARCHING. AUTHORITY OR CAN ABILITY TO TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS HAPPENING AND AND I'M A LAST QUESTION AND AT THE ONE I POSE? BEFORE IS IN TERMS OF THE LA ANNOUNCES DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT TO A GAS TAX REVENUE. IF IF WE USE AS WE PROGRESS AT AND IN TERMS OF MOORE'S THAT'S ON THE ROAD. BUT. NO ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE DO NOT HAVE THE. PROJECTS AT THIS TIME. IN JAPAN IF THAT'S OKAY AND JUST MENTION THAT THERE IS A STUDY THAT'S UNDER WAY CURRENTLY AT UC DAVIS WAS CALLED FOR UNDER S. B. ONE WHICH I EMISSIONS RAISING THE GAS TAX I IMPLEMENTED A FIRST EVER. A HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE ON TV REGISTRATIONS THAT WOULD. BEGIN TO. INCREASE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM THOSE VEHICLES AYE IT LOOKS AT THE IMPACT ON THE THAT THE GAS TAX REVENUE GOING OUT. AS WELL AS EXAMINES ALTERNATIVE MECHANISMS FOR FUNDING THE ROAD SYSTEM ONCE OF ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU MENTIONED BEFORE LIKE REGRESSIVITY. THAT THE CENTRAL FINANCIAL PARTISAN PROGRESS I'M HAPPY TO GET YOU AN UPDATE ON IT THAT BE HELPFUL. THOUGH THE CENTRAL FINDING IS THAT WERE ONE OF THE HAVE A FUNNY IS THAT SO FAR AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE OF THAT THIS HAVE PROGRAM. THE IMPACTS ON REVENUE FROM THOSE VEHICLES. IS MUCH SMALLER THAN WHAT WE SEE FROM THE IN IMPACT FROM INFLATION A PREVIOUS TO TO INCREASE INDEXING THAT THE GAS TAX TO THAT TO TO INFLATION AND THE IMPACT ON FUEL EFFICIENCY. I INCREASING FUEL EFFICIENCY POTENTIAL VEHICLES ACTUALLY MUCH BIGGER. IMPACT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE SO FAR. AND AND CONTINUES TO BE THROUGH THE THE BUTTON THAT PROGRAM'S SET SO THAT I CAN HOURS IF I CAN OWNERS IF I WANT SQUARE FOCUS SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT. AS CARS BECOME MORE FEW FUEL EFFICIENT NOW THAT'S THE HAVING A LARGE IMPACT ON THE GAS TAX REVENUE YET MUCH LARGER BUT IN TERMS OF THESE ADS RIGHT THAT'S ONLY GOING TO IMPROVE LIKE. NOTE WOULDN'T THAT. EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM YET SO IT'S CLEAR THAT WOULD THAT IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED A WAY TO FUND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT TAKES ALL VEHICLES INTO ACCOUNT. OKAY SO THAT SO IN TERMS OF THE CONCLUSION THE CONCLUSION IS. S. UNDEFINED I GUESS INTO TO THE CITY BUT IN TERMS OF THE HYPOTHESES. YOU WERE GONNA ANTICIPATED REDUCTIONS OVER AT THE FINE. ADDITIONAL REVENUE SOURCES THOSE THAT WOULD BE THAT IN THE LONG TERM YOU NEED YOU NEED A WAY FOR IT TO PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OKAY. SO THERE IS A REDUCTION AND GUESS I SEVEN YOU THERE IS A AND IT'S THERE DEFINITELY IS. AND BECAUSE ORDERS MORE VEHICLES ON THE MARKET AYE IT IT'S JUST RELATIVE TO OTHER FACTORS IT HASN'T BEEN LARGE WE DON'T EXPECT TO BE. IN THAT IN THE LIFETIME OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SORT OF. TWENTY THIRTY TIME FRAME FELL AFTER THAT ABSOLUTELY PERFECT WEEKENDS IN CONCERT. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INTELLIGENCE. IF YOU DON'T MIND STICKING AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT. AND ARE THE FINAL PANEL ON THE SET TOPIC IS SIR. REGARDING GOT REAL WORLD SUCCESS AND CHALLENGE AND WE'VE GOT THREE PANELISTS COMING UP. WELCOME TO HOLD IT. THANKS FOR BEING HERE I'M NOT SURE WHO'S GOING FIRST. I I CAN START THANK YOU MISTER CLEAN AIR AND MEMBERS ANTHONY HARRIS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR CHARGE POINT. WE ARE THE WORLD'S LARGEST NETWORK OF THE V. CHARGING PORTS WE HAVE OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND CHARGING POINTS TODAY TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE LOCATED HERE. IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE. DESIGN MANUFACTURE AND DELIVER A CHARGING STATION HARDWARE AND NETWORK SERVICES FOR THE FULL ARRAY OF DIFFERENT MARKET SEGMENTS SO FROM. CHARGING IN YOUR HOME RESIDENTS MULTI FAMILY ALL THE WAY TO PUBLIC AND WORKPLACE AND THEN. AS REFERENCE BEFORE THE HIGH SPEED DC FAST CHARGERS THAT WE ARE TO POINT ALONG AYE INTERSTATE CORRIDORS IN URBAN HUBS AND AT THAT SCENE TECHNOLOGIES BEING USED TO CHARGE THE. GROWING SECTOR OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY OUR VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION. I'M CHUCK POINT WAS UP FOUNDED AND WE ARE STILL HEADQUARTERED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE A HOME GROWN CALIFORNIA BUSINESS THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO OUR GROWING EXPAND AN EXPORT. OUR MODEL BASED ON THE SUCCESSFUL CLEAN TRANSPORTATION POLICIES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M MOST RECENTLY LAUNCHING IN FOUR COUNTRIES ACROSS. EUROPE AND THROUGHOUT THIS TEN YEAR HISTORY. WE'VE GAINED A LOT OF INVALUABLE EXPERIENCE ON BOTH OF THE. BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH DEPLOYING EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ON TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM. A SPECIFIC PROJECT THAT WE'RE DOING AYE TO DEPLOY DC FAST CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ALONG. HIGHWAY CORRIDORS AND DOWN. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE RECIPIENT OF A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT THROUGH THIS HE SEES A OUR EFFORT BTP PROGRAM. WE'RE GONNA BE MATCHING THAT THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS WITH OVER SIX MILLION DOLLARS AND PRIVATE CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO. DEPLOY A. FAST CHARGERS ALONG THE NORTH TO SOUTH INTERSTATE FIVE ACCORD OR HERE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT SEVENTY SITES ARMED WITH A CHARGING STATION DEPLOYED ON NO MORE THAN EVERY FIFTEEN MILES. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS TO DEPLOY THESE DC FAST CHARGERS ARM ALONG THE INTERSTATE IN RURAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND WE ARE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE BROKE GROUND LAST YEAR AND HAVE A FULLY OPERATIONAL ADDITIONAL STATION I IN REDDING CALIFORNIA. TOM WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH AYE THIS PROJECT IN IN OUR EXPERIENCE. SOME SOME MAJOR FACTORS IS THAT NUMBER ONE THERE IS A HIGH AMOUNT OF VARIABLE COST THAT WERE UNANTICIPATED THAT GO INTO. THE INSTALLATION OF THE CHARGING STATIONS THEMSELVES ARMS HEAVY AMOUNT OF ENGINEERING. THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU'RE ACTUALLY ON SITE SO YOU CAN YOU CAN PLAN FOR THE PROJECTS YOU CAN PICK IDEAL LOCATIONS BUT REALLY UNTIL YOU START TO UNDERSTAND THE GREAT CONDITIONS BECAUSE THIS IS YOU KNOW. OUR HOPE ELECTRIC FEELING I'M WITHOUT THAT WORK. THERE'S A LOT OF AGAIN ON VARIABLE COSTS SO. THAT MAJOR LESSON LEARNED FROM US IS TO ENGAGE. THE LOCAL ELECTRIC UTILITY EARLY AND OFTEN I MEAN IF FROM FROM THE VERY CONCEPTION PHASE OF THIS TYPE OF DEPLOYMENT YOU NEED TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH WHOEVER'S MENTION THE DISTRIBUTION GRID. ON IT CANNOT BE AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND. I'M I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT. WE ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED AND WORKING WITH ALL THREE OF THE MAJOR I'M VETERAN UTILITIES. ON THIS AND. REALLY WANTED TO TO HIGHLIGHT A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE WITH WITH TEACHING OBVIOUSLY FOR STARTING FROM NORTH TO SOUTH WE'VE ENGAGE THEM FIRST BUT THEY HAVE A DEDICATED INTERNAL TEAM THAT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US WE'RE COORDINATING ON ALMOST A WEEKLY BASIS. IN AND WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S ON TO GIVE AND ANECDOTES. IF WORD APPOINTMENTS AT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT ALONG A HIGHWAY CORRIDOR THAT HAS A MONTHLY AVERAGE PEAK DEMAND OF. FIFTY KILOWATTS AND THEN I'M GONNA DROP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY KILOWATTS OF FAST CHARGERS IN THEIR PARKING LOT. I COULD BE QUADRUPLING THEIR ELECTRIC LOAD OVERNIGHT. SO THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE IT'S AGAIN ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOCUS ON THE POINT THESE THINGS ALONG RURAL HIGHWAY. SECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE COORDINATING WITH THE UTILITY SO THEY UNDERSTAND AND AND WE CAN MINIMIZE THE DISTRIBUTION GREAT IMPACT AND THEREFORE MINIMIZE COSTS AND AND. IN HOPES OF PROVIDING BENEFITS TO THE GREAT. I SO. FOR US ARM THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN A KEY LEARNING AND THEN. ALSO. REALLY RELYING ON IN DAYTON WITH A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. BECAUSE BOB A LOT OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE GREAT SALESPEOPLE PRESS IN TERMS OF HELPING TO ATTRACT POTENTIAL SITES SO GOING INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THERE ARE A LOT OF AIR QUALITY ADVOCATES OTHER CLEAN ENERGY ADVOCATE GROUPS NEED THESE OTHER ONES THAT BECOME GREAT PARTNERS IN HELPING TO PROVIDE OUTREACH ON THAT YOU KNOW. THERE'S FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE YET CHARGE POINT IS GONNA BE THE POINT STATIONS WHAT ARE THE IDEAL LOCATIONS AND SO IT'S BEEN A GREAT LESSON LEARNED TO MAKE SURE THAT. AGAIN IN THE PLANNING PHASE FROM THE GET GO THAT YOU'RE ENGAGING GROUPS LIKE THAT. FOR US ARM I WOULD SAY THAT THE ABILITY TO BE ENGAGED AND WITH THIS YOU SEE IN THIS PROGRAM. BUT THEN ALSO HAVING THE ABILITY TO BE ENGAGED. THROUGH. THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT UTILITIES HAVE AND THEN ALSO JUST AS A PIVATE SECTOR BUSINESS TO POINT STATIONS BICU THEY WERE PRIVATE CAPITAL. PREVIOUS PANEL TALKED A LOT ABOUT COORDINATION WE GET TO BE A ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE COURTING IN CITIES AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR BECAUSE WERE INVOLVED ACROSS THE BOARD. IN IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT. INITIATIVES SO IT'S IT'S REALLY INVALUABLE TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE ON THE INVESTMENT FROM THE C. SEE. TO AYE INCLUDE PRIVATE CAPITAL NOT AND BUILD UPON. A SCALABLE BUSINESS MODEL FOR US THAT WERE ALREADY SEEN RESULTS WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AGAIN THOSE COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS OTHER MUNICIPAL UTILITIES. THAT HAVE ALREADY TALKED TO US BECAUSE THEY HEARD THAT WE'RE DOING THIS IN THE C. C. AND WANTING TO SEE A WAY WE CAN PARTNER AND EXPAND UPON THIS INITIAL SEVENTY SITES AND THAT THAT'S REALLY AS A RESULT OF. THIS INITIAL SEED FUNDING FOR THAT FOR THE PROGRAM SO ARMED. AND THE OF THE OTHER AREA THAT I THINK. REALLY THIS THAT THE CC PROGRAM HAS HELPED I'M GOING BACK TO IS THE ABILITY FOR US TO MAKE IT ECONOMICALLY POSSIBLE TO PUT STATIONS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THIS IS A HUGE INITIATIVE CROSS I KNOW IT'S A HUGE INITIATIVE FOR THE STATE AND I'M I'LL JUST TAKE THE OPTION YOU TANK. THANK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AT THIS COMMITTEE FOR SUPPORTING S. B. NINETY TWO LAST YEAR WHICH IS GOING TO DIRECT THE VW SETTLEMENT FUNDING. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION THAT INTO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE APPRECIATE. YOUR WORK ON THAT AND. YEAH I I'LL JUST SAYING CLOSING THAT ON CHARGE POINT STRONGLY SUPPORTS ON THE CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THE CC ZEV INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND WE THINK. THAT. INITIATIVES LIKE THIS ALONG WITH. LEGISLATION LIKE MR KING'S AB TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN WHICH IS GOING TO US THAT REQUIREMENTS FOR TWENTY FORTY AROUND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ARE GONNA BE VITAL TO ON REACHING THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS. OF CHINA FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGING STATIONS AND AND FIVE MILLIONS AT SO WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME IN AND PERCENT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT. THANK YOU FOR CAN HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF THE PANEL THAT BE GREAT. MR OVER YEAH THANK YOU FOR CUTTING ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED ABOUT THE NEED. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FROM OUR WORK WITH THE ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT AUTHORITY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AB T. A. AND THEIR EFFORT TO BECOME THE NATION'S FIRST. ALL ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUS FLEET MY NAME IS FRED SILVER AND I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF CAL START. CALIFORNIA BASED NONPROFIT FOCUSED ON COMMERCIALIZING PAIN TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES AYE LEADER ABBAS PROGRAM. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT. AB T. A SERVICE FOR DID FIFTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS IN THE CITIES OF LANCASTER AND PALMDALE. AND AIMS TO HAVE A HUNDRED PERCENT ZERO EMISSION BUS FLEET BY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN OR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WITH EIGHTY FIVE ELECTRIC TRANSIT AND MOTOR COACH EHICLES THEY CURRENTLY HAVE FORTY NINE ON ORDER. AND. MANY OF THEM WILL BE DEPLOYED IN THE VERY SHORT TERM. CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. FUNDING HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT ENABLER FOR THEM TO PURCHASE THE EIGHT THEIR BUSES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S PROVIDED ALMOST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THE NINETY MILLION. THAT THEY NEED TO GET TO A HUNDRED PERCENT ZERO EMISSIONS. I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU SOME OF THE KEY INFRASTRUCTURE LESSONS WE HAVE LEARNED WHILE WORKING WITH AB T. A. WHILE AB K. IS DEPLOYING UP TO EIGHTY FIVE ELECTRIC TRANSIT BUSES. JUST FIFTY ELECTRIC TRAMS BUSES CAN REQUIRE THREE MEGAWATTS WHICH IS. FIFTY PERCENT MORE POWER THAN A SKYSCRAPER. LIKE THE TRANSAMERICA BUILDING AND SAN FRANCISCO. WE HAVE FOUND THAT ALSO FOUND THAT ELECTRICITY DEMAND CHARGES A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY BILL. CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ENERGY EXPONENTIALLY AND CHALLENGE THE BUSINESS CASE. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THESE COSTS AND AND GROW THEIR ZERO EMISSION FLEET AB T. A HAS NEEDED THE USE INNOVATIVE LOAD MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. AND. A FOOTBALL FIELD OF SOLAR ENERGY TO MINIMIZE THEIR ENERGY COSTS. ANY AB T. A SPENDING ABOUT SIX MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS A REALLY SMALL AMOUNT AS COMPARED TO OTHER PROPERTIES. EH. IT COULD BECAUSE THEY ARE THE PROPERTIES OF MUCH MORE CONSTRAINED. SPACE AB T. A HAS HAD IT EASIER GIVEN THEIR SIZE AND LAND AVAILABILITY THAT THEY HAVE. HAD IT MADE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY KEEP THOSE COSTS DOWN WE EXPECT THAT ARE THE URBAN TRANSIT BUS OPERATORS WITH LARGER FLEAS. I WITH LESS AVAILABLE LAND SPACE WILL BE SEVERELY OF FURTHER CHALLENGED BY THE COFFIN COST OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND MILLION NEW AND ADVANCED INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNS. COSTING TWO TO THREE TIMES THAT AMOUNT. MANY OF THESE LARGER BOSS PROPERTIES USE STADIUM STYLE. BUS PARKING BACK TO BACK VEHICLES WITH NO ROOM FOR CONVENTIONAL CHART ONE CHARGER FOR ONE BUS. KIND OF SYSTEM AND THESE INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNS MAY I HAVE TO COME. DOWN FROM OVERHEAD CANOPIES. AND EVEN AT HIGHER RATES. HIGH CHARGING RATES TO SUPPORT THE LIMITED AVAILABLE SPACE. AB TEA A AS USING SOLAR AND A VERY LARGE AUXILIARY IN ADDITION. AB T. AS USING OF VERY LARGE ABSOLUTE POWER GENERATOR COMBINED WITH THEIR SOLAR FOR PROVIDING RESILIENCY IN THE EVENT. OF POWER OUTAGES THERE IS A REAL NEED FOR CLEANUP MICHAEL GRADES. USING SOLAR AND BACK UP PARRIS. STE BATTERY STORAGE TO. TO BE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE POWER DURING DURING THESE AVERAGES AND ALSO PROVIDE LOWER COST RENEWABLE ENERGY. GOING FORWARD BATTERY ELECTRIC BUS FLEET THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ARE NOW STARTING TO SCALE UP TO THEIR ZERO MISSION BUCKS FLEETS WE ANTICIPATE A LARGE SHARE. OF THE ELEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA TRANSIT BUSES TO BE ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY. TRANSIT BUSES ARE JUST BEGINNING. I HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS ARE CATCHING UP REAL FAST JUST TWO YEARS BEHIND THEM AS WELL. INFRASTRUCTURE NOW IS THE MAJOR BARRIER. I'VE ABOUT SLEEP TO GET TO LARGE SCALE OPERATIONS AND NEW INNOVATIVE EVERY STRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES WILL BE REQUIRED AND INFRASTRUCTURE. FUNDING IS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THEM WE'LL NEED NEW. INNOVATIVE DESIGN CONFIGURATIONS ADVANCE PLANNING AND CHARGING STRATEGIES. I BELIEVE THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM. SHOULD GO BEYOND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING FOR JUST LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AND FUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNS NECESSARY. PRE ZERO EMISSION BUSES TO GET TO LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENTS. THIS ENERGY COMMISSION'S SUPPORT COULD INCLUDE NEW MICRO GRADES FOR BUS OPERATIONS USING SOLAR ENERGY STORAGE DESIGNS. INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING GRANTS SO IF WE CAN MAKE SMARTER INVESTMENTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED TO GET TWO HUNDRED PERCENT ZERO EMISSION. AND NEW INNOVATIVE CHARGER CONFIGURATIONS CHARGING AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. ALSO THE CONTINUED I EVER STRUCK SUPPLEMENT NOW BEING CONSIDERED BY. CARB UNDER THE A TREAT PROGRAM IS HIGHLY VALUED ACCORDING TO THE MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA'S EMISSION BUS COALITION. AB CARES A MEMBER OF THAT COALITION OF THAT COALITION OF MANAGE STIRRED MANAGED BY CASTRO. AND IS MADE UP OF THE PIONEERING TRANSIT FLEETS IN CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION THIS GROUP IS STRONGLY. RECOMMENDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING BEING PROVIDED OF THE VOLKSWAGEN SUPPLEMENT AS WELL THERE IS NO INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPLEMENT. FOR BUSES IN THE VOLKSWAGEN FUNDING. IN SUMMARY AND A LARGE PART DUE TO THE. SUPPORT FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROBLEM IT'S BEEN GREAT FOR AB CARE IT'S BEEN A LONG A NEIGHBOR. FOR THEM TO BE ARE BECOME THE NATION'S FIRST ZERO. ZERO EMISSION BUSTLING. I AB KEY A. IS A PIONEER IN DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR ITS LEADERSHIP. TO HELP OTHER TRANS PROPERTIES FOLLOW AB CASE PATH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR BOTH ZERO MISSION BUS PURCHASES. AND DEPLOYING CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE NEEDED THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION TO MY TESTIMONY TODAY. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. UNTIL VOICE WITH THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT HAD BEEN THE MANAGER OF THE ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION. AT* SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS TODAY. CURRENTLY AT* WE'VE DEPLOYED OUR OWN PUBLIC NETWORK OF DC FASH ORDERS IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. AND WE ALSO HAVE VARIOUS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH REGARDS TO LEVEL TWO CHARGING. IN RESIDENTIAL MULTI FAMILY COMMERCIAL GROUPS. PERSON LIKE TO THINK OF A LEGISLATURE FOR ALL THE FUNDING THROUGH THE YEARS. AND. AS MENTIONED THEY ARE OF FBP T. PROGRAM. THE SHORTER NAME WE LIKE TO CALL IT IS ALSO THE A. B. EIGHT PROGRAM SO. RECOGNIZE THAT THAT PROGRAM REALLY GOT ITS INITIATION. OF FROM THIS BODY. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE FOR THE ZERO MISSION. VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE. ALSO LOOKING AT KIND OF GAPS IN THAT GOING FORWARD. TO MEET THAT GOAL THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA LITERATURE INTERPRETATION COALITION. THAN WE'VE WHICH WERE A MEMBER WERE ALSO LOOKING AT THERE COULD BE AN ADDITIONAL TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR GAP. TO MEET THE FULL REQUIREMENTS. OF. TRYING TO MEET THAT FIVE MILLION GOAL OUT TO TWENTY THIRTY. LESSONS LEARNED SUCCESS STORIES FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE UMBERLEIGH THE BEEN TWO MAJOR ONES THAT WE REALLY ENCOUNTERED FIRST IS AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING. AND SECOND IS PROBABLY INTEREST TO PROPERTY OWNERS ACTUALLY HOST INSIGHT. AT STATION. WE STARTED THE POINT OR DC THATCHER GREEN. GOING BACK ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO THE FOR PRIMARY PURPOSE FOR US AT THE TIME. WAS. IN RESPONSE TO AN RGB GO SETTLEMENT. WHICH WAS IN THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY SERVICE AREAS DID NOT ADDRESS THE PUBLIC ON UTILITY SO WE STARTED UP OUR OWN PROGRAM TO KIND OF FILL OUR OWN GAP. IN THAT PROGRAM AND WE'VE REALLY. WITH THROUGH OUR OWN FUNDING. WERE ABLE TO TO GET OUR. STATION STARTED BUT THE SECONDARY THING THAT WE FOUND WAS WHO WAS VERY HARD TO CONVINCE PROPERTY OWNERS ACTUALLY WHAT US. BUILD A STATION ON THEIR PROPERTY. ON MANY OCCASIONS MODE WAS GOING TO PICK UP THE WHOLE TAP PER STATION CONSTRUCTION.% BUT THE STATION. PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD BACK OUT AT SOMETIME DURING THE PROCESS. THAT WATER CONCERNS ABOUT THE STATION'S BEING PROFITABLE ENOUGH FOR THE SITE HOST TO CONSIDER. CONCERNS ABOUT LIABILITY RISK CONCERNS ABOUT AMERICAN DISABILITY ACT EXPOSURE. ALSO PARKING CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS. BY FAR AWAY THOUGH I THINK A MAJORITY OF AT THE PROFITABILITY TO THE OPERATOR. ON SITE HOST WAS THE BIGGEST QUESTION. THESE. STATIONS WE DON'T THINK ARE VERY BIG PROFIT. CENTERS CHARGING STATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL HAVE USUALLY BEEN INSTALLED THAT A BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT CUSTOMERS TO THAT BUSINESS. AND THEN THE BUSINESS MODEL IS TO MAKE UP FOR RETAIL SALES WHEN. PEOPLE COME INTO THAT STORE THE AT THE PARK THEIR CAR FOR THIRTY MINUTES AND GO IN AND BUY GROCERIES SERVES A CERTAIN. FINANCIAL TRANSACTION THAT THEY COME BACK OVER. ALSO IT'S VERY OBVIOUS SOME AUTOMAKERS TESLA BEING THE POSTER CHILD HAS SUPPORTED CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. UP UNTIL RECENTLY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FREE FROM A FOR. SECURELY THE. OLDER VEHICLES. ALL THAT WAS IT ESSENTIALLY TO SELL VEHICLES NOT NECESSARILY TO PROVIDE THE ENERGY. SO THE PROFITABLE BUSINESS MODELS MAKE IT REALLY KIND OF. ON DISINCENTIVE FOR A LOT OF FOLKS TO CITE. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE GO THROUGH A LOT OF CITING A SUPPORT WORK. A SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE. WE WORK WITH A LOT OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS. ONE THING ABOUT ELECTRIC CUT TRANSPORTATION THAT'S KINDA UNIQUE IF YOU ARE NOT TIED TO A CERTAIN FACILITY. WHAT WE ESSENTIALLY DO IS HELP THEM E. VALUE WAIT MULTIPLE SITES AROUND A GIVEN LOCATION? TO TRY TO FIND THE MOST ECONOMICAL SITE WITH REGARDS TO WORD ATTACHED TO THE GRID. ON THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES WHO IT WHIRL. YOU KNOW HELP IDENTIFY. I DON'T KNOW THE METRIC WOULD PROBABLY BE FOUR TO FIVE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR EVERYONE THAT GETS CITED. TRYING TO FIND THE BEST A PLACE ON THE GRID ANOTHER THING THAT WE WILL ALSO DO IS. HELP WITH THE COORDINATION AT SMUD WE WORK WITH. SEVERAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ALL TRYING TO COME IN AND PROVIDE INFRASTRUCTURE. WE OURSELVES IN OUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM. IN LISTTHEM TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY ARE NOT INSTALLING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO WERE. MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN COVER RENA THOSE AREAS WHICH ARE. AND BASICALLY. GONNA HAVE GAPS IN IN THE COVERAGE. SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE SEEN ON MODERN DAY TIMES WE REALLY ARE SEEN MUCH MORE COST REDUCTION IN NEW CONSTRUCTION OPPORTUNITIES. AS MUCH OF THIS INFRASTRCTURE IS WE CAN GET INTO A BUILDING OR A PARKING LOT BEFORE IT IS BILL SO WE DON'T HAVE TO COME IN AND. INSTALL IT AFTER THE FACT ON THE BALLPARK EVEN METRIC WE HAVE IS IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF A TEN X. COST REDUCTION. IF WERE ABLE TO GET THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IN DURING THE. IN NEW CONSTRUCTION OPPORTUNITY. THAT'S REALLY ALSO PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT WE FEEL IN THE MULTI FAMILY ARENA I THINK. MULTI FAMILY LEVEL TWO IS WHAT WE'RE ALL KINDA STARTING TO CONSIDER IS PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST NUT TO CRACK IN. EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO NEW APARTMENTS GOING UP THIS MUCH CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS WE CAN GET SPECT INTO THOSE. BUILDINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT WE ALSO SEE THAT THAT OVERLAPS VERY OFTEN WITH LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO I'M REALLY KIND WORKS ON THAT PROBLEM. IN SO WE THINK THAT'S A A BIG OPPORTUNITY WERE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT SOME OF OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS TO PRIORITIZE IT TOWARDS NEW CONSTRUCTION. ANOTHER ONE THAT WE'VE SEEN HAN THE CHARGING SERVICE PROVIDER. THAT'S WORKED ON I MENTION THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO CONVINCE A PROPERTY OWNER TO US CITED STATION WHAT THEY'VE DONE SUCCESSFULLY IS THEY WILL GO IN. GAUGE A LARGE. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP COMPANY THAT HAS MULTIPLE PROPERTIES ALL OVER THE STATE ARE ALL OVER THE NATION. THEY'LL NEGOTIATE A MASTER AGREEMENT SO THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MULTIPLE TYPES OF PROPERTY SITUATIONS THAT KEEPS THEM FROM HAVING TO GO ON NEGOTIATE INDIVIDUAL ONE OFF TYPES CONTRACTS SO YOU GET. AN ECONOMY OF SCALE ON THAT ALSO RECOGNIZES THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES ARE VALUING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. MOST OF THEM ARE TIED TO A RETAIL BUSINESSES SO THAT VERY MUCH. HELPS BRING IN. CUSTOMERS TO THEIR. FACILITIES. AND. I GOTTA GET MY LAST PAGE UN. LASTLY. MORE ON THE TECHNICAL AND. RIGHT NOW IN DC FAST CHARGING I'LL JUST MENTION THAT THERE'RE TWO TO THREE DIFFERENT. PHYSICAL CONNECTOR STANDARDS THAT REALLY INCREASES COST IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS A SIGHTED AT EACH LOCATION. WERE HOPING IN WHERE UP PARTICIPATING IN FORM SET CAN. AND TRY TO COMBINE THAT. BASICALLY GET EVERYBODY DOWN TO A CON THEN. STANDARD CONNECTOR CONFIGURATION SO WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE I'LL JUST SAY ONE DEDICATED FOR ONE TYPE OF VEHICLE ONE FOR ANOTHER. AND HAVE TO BASICALLY HAVE CONFUSION OR I HAVE MULTIPLE UNITS THERE WHICH IS. ADDITIONAL COSTS AT EACH SITE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE ENTIRE FLEET OF VEHICLES OUT THERE. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO CUT ITS SUCCESSES AND THEN. SOME OF THE THINGS WE THINK COULD BE BETTER. THANK YOU JUST A FOLLOW UP ON NO ON YOUR LAST POINT TO A WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT TO A VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS OR. ENTERED THAT CONNECT EIGHT SICKLY THE THE. SECONDLY THE JAPANESE USE A STANDARD CALLED THE CHATHAM ó CONNECTOR. EUROPEAN AND U. S. CONNECTORS. ARE CALLED THE. BASICALLY THE COMBINED. J. SEVENTEEN SEVENTY TWO CONNECTOR. GETS VERY TECHNICAL BUT THERE'S TO PHYSICAL AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TWO CONNECTORS. AT EACH DC FAST CHARGING SITE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE EVERYBODY THERE IS COSTS INCREASE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH. CITED. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS UPON. QUESTION I APPRECIATE CHARGE BUT LET ME TO ART THAT THAT YOUR FACILITY. FIFTY MONTHS BACK AT IN TERMS OF. CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE UTILIZING WHEN YOU IDENTIFY SITES WHAT ARE THE IDEAL CRITERIA HERS WAS IDEA SITES FREE FOR YOU IT ARE THEY GAS STATIONS THAT EXIST ALREADY ARE THEY. A RETAIL. SHOPPING CENTERS WELL WHAT'S WHAT'S WOULD YOU CONSIDER AN IDEAL SITE GET THAT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. SO FOR US FROM. IN ADDITION TO WHAT I ALREADY TOUCHED ON WITCHES AND AND. OUT BILL TOUCHED ON THIS A WELL AND IN ADDITION TO THE THE GREAT IMPACTS IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE SITE'S GOING TO BE IN TERMS AN IDEAL LOCATION TO SET A FAST CHARGER WE UTILIZE WHAT'S CALLED THE MODEL WHICH IS. WHERE WOULD YOU WANT YOUR MOM TO PULL UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE IT'S RAINING AND ACTIVE BE FOR HALF AN HOUR TO CHARGE A CAR? SO FOR US IT'S A ACCESSIBILITY WELL LIT. YOU KNOW EASILY IDENTIFIABLE SIGNAGE ALL OF THESE THINGS GOING TO INTO THAT LIKE I SAID SO FOR ALL OF OUR SITE IT HAS TO MEET THE THAT THE MOM RULE TAX. PROCEEDED SO WHAT THAT TRANSLATES INTO BEING IS A LOT OF THE SIGHTS ALONG THIS HIGHWAY CORRIDORS ARE. A RETAIL SHOPPING CENTERS. A STARBUCKS OF BURGER KING ALBERT AT THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF THAT ESTABLISHED ON A GAS STATION. CAN WORK BUT IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO MEET YOU KNOW ALL THOSE CONDITIONS AND ALSO MEET THE ON DISTRIBUTION GRID CONDITIONS AS WELL AND I AND MY LAST QUESTION TERMS OF THE THE. THE INCREASE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY USAGE AND LET THEIR WHAT. WHAT IS DONE IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN WHEN YOU SEE OF A QUADRUPLING OF OF? BURGER KINGS OR MCDONALD'S AT JERSEY USE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS OUR COORDINATION WITH UTILITIES IN TERMS OF THAT. THAT ABSOLUTE SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A VARIETY DIFFERENCE NUYS THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF IT'S. WE ARE. NOT AT A PHASE YET WHERE THIS HAS TO BE THE SITE MEANING THAT THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT OPTIONS WITHIN THE SAME REASON WE CAN DO. IF IT'S COST PROHIBITIVE OR THERE'S GOING TO BE. ESSENTIAL IMPACTS NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE GRADE WE ARE WE WOULD HAVE TO EVALUATE AN ALTERNATIVE SITE IF THIS IS THE SITE AND HAS TO BE THAN WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH THE UTILITY. IN ORDER TO UPGRADE THE POWER IN THERE IS BECAUSE THERE'S COST THAT'S INSTALLATION BECAUSE AS A VARIABLE COST THAT. WE WOULD BEAR IN TOWARDS TO A IN ORDER TO UPGRADE. THE ELECTIONS CAPACITY INSIDE. MR SO OVER A ON THIS IS PROBABLY A A. A REALLY BIG TOPIC TO TO COVER BUT IF YOU COULD JUST DE PERHAPS GIVE ME A SUMMARY ARMED RESPONSE. A I LEARNED YESTERDAY THAT CHINA IS OPERATING A FLEET OF SOME FIFTEEN THOUSAND. ELECTRIC BUSES WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THEM OR I IS IT JUST COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOT APPLICABLE OUT WHAT THE FIRST POST TWENTY THOUSAND ONE CITY SO I ICE IT'S EVEN GOTTEN THE AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SCALE IS ABOUT A MILLION. AT SOMETHING LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES BORDER YEAR. IN CHINA VERSUS. ARE BY THOUSAND TRANSIT BUSES BUT IN THE UNITED STATES EVERYTHING THERE IS IS DONE ON STEROIDS I THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ON MY SHORTS COORDINATED. AND A SCANNING TOUR WOULD BE REALLY VALUED I THINK. AND GOING THROUGH CHINA. BUT I THOUGHT SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON IN EUROPE AS WELL. A EUROPE IS AS BUYING ELECTRIC BUSES IT AT MORE THAN TRIPLE THE RATE. THAT THE U. S.'S OKAY NOT QUITE AS MUCH AS ASIA PROBABLY A LITTLE CLOSER. IN THE KIND OF. PERFORMANCE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS THAT THE. U. S. AS AND I THINK A LOT TO BE LEARNED FROM SCANNING TO WORK. OF EUROPE AS WELL EFFECT I JUST NOTICED RECENTLY ON A ON A. R. P. THAT. LA MEJOR HAS OUT ON THE STREET RIGHT NOW FOR. THE LOOKING FOR CONSULTANT TO PLAN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE ALLEY METRO YOU KNOW IS THE LARGEST TRANSIT PROPERTY IN THE STATE. TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED BUSES ARE THEY HAVE STE THREE. IT'S GETTING TOWARDS. OVERSEAS. AND. AT BAY THEY WANT BUDGET INTO THAT SO IT HELPED US WOULD BE OUR TEA. IN THE EARLY MARKET TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE T. CAN COME FROM OVERSEAS HERE AND I THINK LEARNING FROM THEM AS WELL. SO I WISH I COULD TELL YOU WHAT THOSE LEARNINGS ARE THE BIGGEST CONCERN I HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE GREAT ISSUES. LOVE TO SEE HAVE A DEAL WITH GREAT RESILIENCY BECAUSE. YOU'RE DEALING WITH PUBLIC. SAFETY ISSUE HERE THESE VEHICLES GOING TO CONTINUE OPERATING. THE GRADES DOWN OKAY SO I TALK ABOUT THESE MICRO BRIDGE SOLUTIONS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW OUR FOLKS DEAL WITH THAT I THINK THERE ARE LEARNING TO BE HAVE I I'M NOT SURE I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE. OKAY THANK YOU AND THAT A A IS A AB T. EXPERIENCING. OF THE KIND OF RIDERSHIP DECLINED THAT. ELEMENTARY IT'S BEEN. REPORTING IN GENERAL I I DON'T THINK THEY I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE IN THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARBUS GROWTH AREA A LOT OF PEOPLE COMMUTING INTO LA. FOR JOBS THAT GOT TRANSPORTED WANT TO SANTA CLARA MIGHT BE THE OPPOSITE TRIED TO THE OPPOSITE UNIT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW AND THEN I JUST KIND OF UNDERSTAND. THE IMPLICATIONS THAT HAS FOR THE TYPE OF SYSTEM WHERE BUILDING OUT FOR STARTING WITH NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE. AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAILORING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO WHAT WE ANTICIPATE FUTURE NEEDS TO BE A LOT MADE AN INTERESTING MAHLER NEIGHBORHOOD BUSES THAT CONNECT LEARNING. EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE ONLY DOT THE CITY OF LA. IS LOOKING TO PUT ON. AND ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FOURTY FOUR ELECTRIC BUSES AND THEY'RE GOING TO DOUBLE THE GONNA USED UP TO ACTION. DOUBLE THEIR OF. YOU KNOW REDUCE THE TWELFTH TIME AND THEY'RE EXPECTING A HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP AND THAT WAS QUESTIONED BY THE CALTRANS WE WENT BACK AND DID ANALYSIS WITH. AND THEY CONFIRMED ON ALMOST A HUNDRED PERCENT RIDERSHIP GAINS IN THE CITY OF LA BY ANY ON THESE ELECTRIC BUSES THAT ALLOWED TO. DEAL WITH A SHORT WHILE TIMES PATHS GOOD GOOD TO HEAR. MISTER TECH. GIPSON QUESTIONS AND YEAH JUST JUST FOR OUR. MISTER HARRISON I JUST TRY TO GET A SENSE OF HOW YOU ON. I KNOW THAT THE COST DIFFERENCE% WAS FAIRLY HIGH BETWEEN LEVEL THREE LEVEL TO. AND. WITH IF YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROPERLY DISTRIBUTE LEVEL THREE VERSES OF A TWO. AND A PARTICULAR. THROUGH THE QUESTIONS RELEVANT IS FOR FOLKS THAT MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO. CHARGING IN THEIR HOME BECAUSE. I THINK THAT CHANGES THEIR THEIR CHARGING NEEDS WHEN THEY'RE OUT. IN PUBLIC. YEAH GREAT QUESTION AS WELL SO. THAT. ACROSS YOU KNOW LIKE THAT ALL SECTORS IN IN IN ALL OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS. IN THE FIRST QUESTION IS GOING TO BE AROUND DWELL TIME SO FOR THE FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE HERE HOW LONG ARE THEY GOING TO BE HERE FOR BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE IN THIS IN A GAS STATION IS THIS IS A CHARGE WHILE YOU PARK. ON SO IT IT DE SHORTEST TIME POSSIBLE TODAY WITH THE VEHICLES THAT ARE ON THE ROAD YOU'RE STILL LOOKING AT A TWENTY TO THIRTY MEN AND THAT'S WHAT THE FAST CHARGE. SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW LONG YOU HAVE SO IF IT'S A MULTI FAMILY DWELLING AND THEY CAN CHARGE OVERNIGHT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE MOST ECONOMICAL AND THEY CAN TO WELL THAT LONG SO THEN LEVEL TWO WORKS PERFECTLY. ON IF THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS AROUND THAT AND WE NEED FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE HIGH TURNOVER. SUCH AS A RETAIL CENTER OR EVEN IN A COMMON AREA OF A MULTI UNIT DWELLING OR LONG HIGHWAY CORRIDOR LEVEL THREE IS GOING TO BE THE PRIMARY APPLICATION THAT YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE SUCH REALLY. IF THE FIRST CRITERIA HOW LONG CAN THAT THE CAR SIT FOR WHAT MAKES SENSE IN THE SECOND CRATER IS GONNA BE ON ECONOMIC I'M ONE OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS. FOR FOLKS THAT CANNOT CHARGE AT HOME. WE DON'T WANT TO EXCLUDE THEM FROM CHARGING AFFORDABLE. AND WHEN I I SAY THAT IS. LEVEL THREE CHARGING THIS DC VETERAN IS BECAUSE IT'S THE HIGHEST ELECTRICAL BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE MORE EXPENSIVE WAY TO CHARGE SO IF THEY CAN AFFORD. TOO BUT AGAIN HAVE THE LONGER DWELL TIME THEN WE CAN OFFER THEM AFFORDABLE CHARGING SOLUTIONS AND SO ON AS MUCH AS WE CAN PROMOTE. BOTH OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR IN CASE THEY NEED TO GET A QUICK CHARGE ON BUT HAVE THE AFFORDABLE OPTION OF A LONGER DWELL TIME LEVEL TO CHARGE. BUT THE TYPICAL LEVEL THREE CHARGE I MEAN I I'VE. I'VE BEEN SINGED YOUR COMPANY WITH LEVEL THREES BUT HOW HOW MUCH WHAT THE TYPICAL CHARGE FOR LEVEL THREE CHARTER. THE COST FOR THE CHARGER OR THE COST FOR THAT ON THE CONSUMER. IT IS A MINUTE TRIP DE OF THE FUELING. AND IT'S IT IT IT VARIES BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A COMMENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT GONNA PRICE BUT IN MOST APPLICATIONS THE CYCLES OF SELF SERVE TO TO CLARIFY CHARGE WHEN DOESN'T SET THOSE PRICES WHOEVER OWNS THE STATION THE SITE IS GONNA SET THOSE PRICES. BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. BASED ON A LOCAL ACTORS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SET THE PRICING AT LOWER THAN THE COST OF A GASOLINE EQUIVALENT PRICE AND SO. FOR A YOU KNOW THIRTY MINUTE CHARGE TO GET EIGHTY PERCENT FULL. YOU KNOW IT IT SHOULD BE UP A COUPLE OF DOLLARS BUT IT JUST DEPENDS OKAY. IT AND I AM MUCH. MYERSON APART APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT STUDY BY THE HEARD IS A STUDY THAT JUST RECENTLY GOT RELEASED DUTCH SAYS. ACTUALLY A LOT OF. HOME. FOLKS WHO DON'T HAVE CHARGING AT HOME AND. CHARGING AT LEVEL THREE. STATIONS BECAUSE IT JUST OUT ABOUT IN THE NEED TO GET THAT. BOSTON THE TO GET A FULL CHARGES FAST POSSIBLE THAT HAS THAT BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE HAVE YOU SEEN STUDIES OR ANYTHING. THAT DOWN COULD RESERVE EDUCATE US AS TO WHAT THE PROPER DEPLOYMENT WOULD BE. YEAH IT AGAIN IT'S GOING TO BE SPECIFIC TO THE AREA FOR US WHAT WE FIND IS ON. WE'VE OUT THE ABILITY TO CHARGE AT HOME OR WORK IF YOU REMOVE THOSE TWO OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHERE IT BECOMES EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AND YOU HAVE TO RELY ON PUBLIC FASTER AGING BECAUSE. THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOOK FOR SOMETHING WHERE I'M GOING TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND I'M GONNA BE IN THE GROCERY STORE BETWEEN FORTY FIVE MINUTES AN HOUR I WANT TO GET. AS FULL OR COMPLETELY FULL AS POSSIBLE THAT TIME AGAIN THIS IS IF I DON'T HAVE THE OPTION CHARGING HOME SO. FOR FOR OUR COMPANY WILL WE FIND IS THAT. WE'VE HAD A LOT IN PRIMARY OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE WORKPLACE JUST BECAUSE THAT BEAT THAT TENDS TO BE A ONE AREA WHERE YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE FOR. EIGHT HOURS PLUS AND YOU CAN USUALLY CHARGE EITHER AFFORDABLY OR A LOT OF WORK PLACES I'D SAY THAT THE VAST VERY WORKPLACES. DON'T CHARGE THE EMPLOYEES AT ALL ON BECAUSE. WHEN YOU'RE CHARGING FOR AYE THAT LONG REPEATED TIME THERE'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HIVE ELECTRICITY COSTS A SERIES WITH A SINGLE LEVEL THREE CHARGE. SO THAT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY A HUGE NEED IF IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON EFFORTS I WOULD SAY NUMBER ONE BARRIER TODAY IS TENANTS AND WHERE THEY DO NOT OWN THEIR PROPERTY THERE IN SOME SORT OF. MULTI UNIT DWELLING CHAIR HOUSING. IT CONTINUES TO BE THE BIGGEST SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO EVEN CHARGING DEPLOYMENT IS THAT SECTOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IF THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE AND THANK OUR PANELISTS IT ON ALL THREE OF OF THE THE. PANELS. NOW. PHIL. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE OTHER PANEL. OKAY. I APOLOGIZE OF MISTER TING. HAD QUESTIONS FOR SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS. PANEL ONE CAN WE BRING PANEL ONE BACK UP. GIVE ME ON MY TOES HERE TODAY. THREE TAKE MY APOLOGIES FOR. STEPPING OUT I THINK I WAS ARMED. YOU TO QUIT THE QUESTION AROUND DIE I. HER THE FIRST PRESENTATION. AND THERE IS THAT. ONE TWO ELEVEN. RATIO REGARDING THE. CHARGING STATIONS TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES. TRY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF. HOW THAT NUMBER WAS DEVELOPED IN THAT ALSO? WANTED TO UNDERSTAND. ON HOW YOU DEVELOPED THE MIX BETWEEN. LEVEL ONE AND LEVEL TWO FAST CHARGERS CLICK THINK. WHERE WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION NOW LOBBY BECAUSE WE'RE FINALLY GETTING SOME CRITICAL MASS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ALSO WITH? BROADER RANGE I THINK THE. THE LEVEL THREE LEVEL TO LEVEL ONE DEMANDS ARE STARTING TO. EVOLVE YES I WANNA GET BETTER SAY THAT IT'S MILK IT OFF AND YOU CAN. SO THAT LIMIT ONE IS ESSENTIALLY A BACK CALCULATION SO THEY THEN ALICE'S THAT THE CC DID WAS REALLY DRIVEN AROUND GETTING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SAD SO I BACK ONE POINT THREE MILLION BE PLUG ELECTRIC VEHICLES. USE THE NATIONAL HOUSE WILL TRAVEL SURVEY DATA DID IT. FROM THE GROUND UP HOW MANY CHARTERS DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DIANNE DRIVERS CAN GET THE ELECTRICITY THEY NEED TO CONTINUE THEIR NORMAL DRIVING PATTERNS. AND SO THE ELEVEN A ONE IS A COMPARISON TO WHERE WE ARE IN THE COMPARED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS IS NOT LIKE A KEY FIND OF REPORTS ARE REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THAT REPORT ITS ACT. I'M THE SPREAD BASED ON HOW MUCH CHARGES ARE SHARED. IN THE PUBLIC WORKS BUT IN THE PUBLIC SPACE OF PUBLIC CHARGING A WORKPLACE CHARGING THAT REACHES BETWEEN THIRTEEN TO WINE AND NINE TO ONE DEPENDING. TO THE AND THAT'S IT CORRESPONDS THAT SPREAD THAT'S IN THE ETI PEROT. REPORT THANK YOU AND THEN THE GAP IS A HUNDRED AND. TWENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND. YES OVERALL WE'RE PROJECTING YOU KNOW. IN THE BELLY ó GAP ANNOUNCED TO BE DONE WITH ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHARTERS YEAH AT ALL THE PROGRAMS TOGETHER. AND IT BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS WHAT WE THINK WE CAN BE INTO THE GAP WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT'S FOR WORKPLACE PUBLIC AND MULTI UNIT DWELLING. AND AND THAT'S BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF HITTING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BETTER AND THE TUTOR FIFTY THOUSAND AS. I'M SORRY BIT SORRY BETWEEN FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGER TARGETS BASED ON THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ZEV TARGET IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SOME EXTENT. IT DOES BUT JUST THE MATH DOESN'T SO I GUESS WHEN I DIVIDE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION BY ALIVE I GOT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND. BOISE SO THEY. SO SINCE IT'S ONE POINT THREE MILLION SAID THAT THERE'S. WHAT'S IN THERE THAT'S CONFUSING IS THAT GONNA FIFTY THOUSAND INCLUDES MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. SO THE RATIO THAT WE COMPARE TODAY THOSE RATIOS THAT I MENTIONED FROM. EXTROVERTED THE INTERNAL THE INTERNAL AYE CCTV INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL UNCLEAN TRANSPORTATION. DID A STUDY FOR US IT IS PART OF HIS THAT ALLIANCE AND THEY LOOK AT PUBLIC AND WORKPLACE CHARGING THOSE OF US WHO THOSE RATIOS ARE BASED ON. AND SO WITHIN THE CDC REPORT I THINK YOU SEE THAT. PUBLIC ON WORKPLACE CHARGING NUMBERS THAT WE NEED IS AND I'M NOT GOING TO MEMORIES OF PLEASE FORGIVE ME FROM ABOUT NINETY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND. AND SO IF YOU DIVIDE THAT BY ONE POINT THREE MILLION STATE AGAIN. SO THAT. SO NOT INCLUDING MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. IN THAT PUBLIC SPACE A WORKPLACE AND. AND PUBLIC OF BELIEVABLE. AND I OUT OF PULL NOT THE NUMBERS ARE ABOUT LIKE NINETY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND IS THE RANGE THAT THE ENTERED THE EVA PRO MODELS FOR IS THE DEMAND. THAT'S RIGHT. THAT OF OTHER THAN THAT'S THE GAP THAT YOU NEED. JUST IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC AND WORKPLACE WE ALSO ARE. WITH THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER TARGETING MULTI UNIT DRAWINGS WHICH IS THE KEY. OKAY I I JUST I GUESS I'D BE BASED ON YOUR. PRESENTATION IT DIDN'T QUITE MAKES. YOUR YOUR. GAP ANALYSIS DON'T MAKE SENSE. SO ARM MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME GREATER DETAIL JR REGARDING THAT AND I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO. THEN SEPARATE THE SEGMENTS IF YOU ARE SEPARATING SEGMENTS BETWEEN. WORKPLACE AND PUBLIC. MULTI FAMILY THAT'S A SEPARATE STRATEGY ON SEPARATE ANALYSIS I'D LIKE WE'D LIKE TO. SEE THAT MORE. PACIFIC WING YES ARMED. IN IT I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A PART SPECIFICALLY OF THIS HEARING BUT. THEY CAN TERMS ON OF THE. CV R. P. PROGRAM. ON. WHAT? WHAT GAVE? SORT OF. WHAT WAS THE ARMY? YEAH WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU'RE MY OFFICE. THINK WEEK OR TWO AGO. ARE. WHAT NUMBERS DO WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT WE COULD GET TO THAT ONE POINT FIVE AND THE FIVE MILLION VEHICLE CALLED? IF YOU I'M SURE YET OF THIS A STEEP CLIFF IN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. THAT SO THAT THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR WE BELIEVE AT THE CURRENT REBATE AMOUNTS IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE DEMAND FOR REBATES. YOU KNOW IN THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE EXPECT THAT OVER TIME THOSE REBATES AT THE REBATE AMOUNTS WOULD NEED TO BE ADJUSTED IN ORDER TO HIT THOSE HIGHER TARGETS. AND THAT'S APPROPRIATE AS THE MARKET BECOMES MORE SUSTAINABLE THERE'S MORE UPTAKE OF THOSE VEHICLES AND WE EXPECT THAT LESS REBATE WILL BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THOSE HIGHER TARGETS. OKAY GREAT. SO I'M JUST. DOING SOME DIVISION YOU GO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DIVIDED BY THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YOU GET EIGHTY THOUSAND TIMES EIGHT. WHICH IS SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND. ADDITIONAL CARS. WHERE DO YOU GET WHAT WOULD WE GET THE ADDITIONAL? CARS. RIGHT SO USING THE LEVELS OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FOR AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE M. OF COURSE THERE'S A MIX BETWEEN PLUGIN HYBRIDS ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES SO THAT. THE RANGES VERY. BUT AS I MENTIONED I THINK OVER TIME. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN THAT TO HER MILLION DOLLAR. PER YEAR LIMIT. AND AT THAT POINT IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE ON A PER VEHICLE BASIS OR I'M CONSIDER HOW TO ADJUST THOSE. REBATES TWO ON TARGET THOSE WHO WOULD BE MOST RESPONSIVE TO THE REBATES SO WE CAN THINK OF OTHER THINGS SUCH AS AN ANSWER P. CAPS. WHERE THERE'S RT INCOME CAPS THAT ARE IN PLACE RATHER TYPES OF? IN TERMS OF RIGHT SO FAR WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS PROGRAM FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S. YOUR DATA DEMONSTRATE TERMS OF WHAT'S MOVING PEOPLE IN TERMS OF. REBATE AMOUNT. WELL THE STUDIES THAT THE REASON THIS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AMOUNT WHAT'S SAD IS THAT THE STUDIES THAT SHOWED AND THROUGH PUBLIC PROCESS WE DETERMINED THAT. THAT AN OVERALL REBATE FOR THE TYPICAL VEHICLE SUCH AS A NISSAN LEAF THAT'S OUT THERE TODAY. WOULD BE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT IT WOULD INCLUDE THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WHICH IS AN INCENTIVE AT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PLUS THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM THE STATE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE THAT OVERALL LEVEL. THAT WAS AND HOW THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN AND THAT'S STILL APPROPRIATE WE BELIEVE TODAY BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE MARKETPLACE. I'M GOING FORWARD. YOU KNOW THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT WOULD NEED TO. WHAT HAPPENS WE LOSE THE FEDERAL TAX GRAY? SO. THERE'S WHICH IS A GOOD THING BECAUSE WE WERE BEING SUCCESSFUL. SO THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THERE AS AS YEAR NOTING THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT AS IT'S CURRENTLY ENVISIONED WOULD GO AWAY OR WOULD START TO GO AWAY. IT IT PHASES DOWN IN A RELATIVELY COMPLICATED FASHION. WHEN MANUFACTURERS SELL MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND VEHICLES OF. THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REBATE AND IT'S ON A PER MANUFACTURE BASIS. THERE IS AND THERE HAS BEEN A PUSH AT AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE TO EXTEND THAT. AND IN FACT. RECENTLY A LOT OF UTILITIES HAVE BEEN MAKING A VERY STRONG PUSHING CONGRESS TO EXTEND THAT. IT AT WILL DISNEY TO MONITOR THE SITUATION AS IT GOES ALONG. GREAT I'M IN IN TERMS OF. STUDIES IS IT YOUR FAITH AT THE RB THAT'S BEEN DOING THE STUDIES OR IS IT. YOU SEE OR WHAT STUDIES ARE YOU REFERRING TO. WE HAVE OUR OWN DATA BUT WE WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND OTHERS. THERE'S A LOT OF STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT ARE DOING WORK AS WELL GREAT IN THAT DATA THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH US YES ABSOLUTELY PERFECT THAT THERE WILL BE. GREAT. THEN. WITH THE GOAL OF GOING BACK TO THE ARE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE. PROPOSAL WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AS OUR. I'M DOING THIS ON DOING THAT OFF MEMORIES OUT CORRECT. VOTE. FOR THE CHARGING INSTRUCTOR POLITICS YEAH SO MENTAL ME. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN BUDGET HERE BUT AN EIGHT YEAR. INVESTMENT OF NINE HUNDRED MILLION. IN THE NINE HUNDRED NINETY WE GIVE ASSEMBLY CHARGING STATIONS. IF YOU FACTOR IN THE THE IN ABOUT A FIFTY PERCENT COSTS EVERYTHING WE CAN FILL THE GAP. SO ABOUT YOU KNOW IT AG LEVEL TWO CHARGING STATION IT IT VARIES RIGHT WITH UP TO CHARGES IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS IF WE DON'T. INCLUDE THE BACK AND INFRASTRUCTURE DC FAST CHARGER IS. YOU KNOW CLOSER HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M SO. WE'RE LOOKING AT IS. YOU NO WITH THAT I'VE HER MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT ATTRACTING PRIVATE CAPITAL WE THINK WE CAN FILL THE GAP OF WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE WERE PROJECTING TO BE BASED ON OUR EXISTING INVESTMENTS THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THAT SUIT. ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. CHARGERS IS THE GAP THAT WE NEED TO FILL. OKAY. OUT OUT OF A TOTAL TO UNDER FIFTY SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING. BASED ON EXECUTIVE PROGRAMS ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHARGERS GIVE OR TAKE AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THAT NOT A LOT THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY AND THAT NUMBER DEPENDING HOW THE PROGRAM'S ROLLOUT. AND THEN GETTING TO THE TUNE OF FIFTY THOUSAND IS THE DIFFERENCE. SO NINE HUNDRED MILLION GETS ME HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS. WENT WELL WITH A COCKED CULTURE FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT BIG GAP THEY WERE TRYING TO FILL IT BETWEEN ONE POINT TWO AND ONE POINT. BILLION AND WHAT THE THEIR YEAH AND I AND NINE WERE HOPING FOR NINE HUNDRED MILLION FROM THE STATE WILL LEVERAGE. THE ADDITIONAL PRIVATE FUNDING NEEDS TO GET TO THE ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT SIX. TWO ONE POINT SIX BILLION CHARTERS. DOLLARS DOLLARS TO GET. OKAY SO IF WE KEEP AYE I GUESS THIS IS. YES I I KNOW THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE DON'T REALLY DO WELL WITH NUMBERS. BUT. YOU YOU KNOW NINE HUNDRED. IF WE GET ANSWERS AS TO HOW MANY CHARGES THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION DIPLOMA WE GO TO. WHAT TYPES OF CHARGERS WHERE WE ANTICIPATE ME BASED ON OUR BEST GAS WITH THE RB ANALYSIS? BECAUSE YOU TALK ABOUT LEVERAGING MONEY IN THE U. TALK ABOUT BUYING CHARGERS AND. THE IT AND AGAIN I I ONLY HAVE AN IPHONE SO I CAN ONLY DO DIVISIONS SO. THE DIVISION DOESN'T QUITE ADD UP AT THIS POINT. SO WE CAN GET IS JUST WEEK WEEK MORE IDEA OF STARVATION UP WE LAID OUT MORE CLEARLY W. GREAT. AND ABSENT. ELECTRIC YOU ENDED UP CAPITAL BUT IT THIS. THE NUMBERS YOU KNOW THAT BASED ON OUR BRAVE IS IN ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND LEVEL TWO CHARTERS IN ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND DC FAST CHARGERS. IT'S A. UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN YOU DO DIVISION BY NINE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD USE ANSWERED INVESTMENT COMES OUT TO ABOUT. WE'D WHEN YOU DIVIDE A HUNDRED AND. NINE HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IT'S LIKE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S QUITE RIGHT. WE'LL GET YOU THE RIGHT NUMBERS JACQUI PERCENT. ALRIGHT DE THANK YOU. I MEAN TO ASK OF THOSE OF YOU WHO WORK A WAY TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT TO BE PATIENT FOR JUST A COUPLE MINUTES LONGER BECAUSE WE HAVE A RARE CONFLUENCE OF HAVING. FIVE MEMBERS. PRESENT MR TING IS HERE AS AN ALTERNATE SO WE'RE GONNA AT A TAKE OUR VOTES NOW. A REMINDING Q. ALL THAT. ON THE ITEMS TO BE HEARD IN PART A OF THE EDGE AND. EVERYTHING IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ISSUE FIVE AND WE VOTED ON ISSUE FIVE EARLIER SO WILL MOVE NOW IN. A GO BACK TO THE A VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. ISSUE NUMBER TWO IN THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR IS BEING HOLDEN WILL BE ADDRESSED IF FUTURE MEETING. WE WOULD DUH I WOULD APPRECIATE A MOTION ON ISSUES ONE THREE NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. AND SIXTEEN. THAT'S A MOTION TO APPROVE THOSE ITEMS. THAT SAID A ON A FOR YOUR PURPOSES ITEM WE'RE GOING HERE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT SEPARATELY. OF AND SO THIS MOTION INCLUDES. ISSUES ONE THREE NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN. AND THAT IS THE MOTION THAT IS BEFORE US. SECONDED LET'S VOTE. BLOOM. I FONG. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON TING. TO WORK PULLED AS A GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL. RIGHT ISSUE FOR OTHER MOTION. BLOOM I FONT. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON TING. IS YOUR FIVE. BOTH BLOOM I FONG GARCIA. MULLIN PATTERSON TING. ISSUE SIX. MOTION. THANK YOU. BLOOM BY PHONE. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. ISSUE SEVEN. BLOOM BY FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN PATTERSON TING. ISSUE A. BLOOM I FONT. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON TING. AND THE LET'S LET'S. I LIKE TO DO THE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR UNDER PART B.. ALSO. YES AND ISSUES NUMBER ON PART BE VOTE ONLY CALENDAR. ISSUES THREE AND FIFTEEN ARE BEING PULLED THEM WILL BE HEARD AT A FUTURE MEETING. AND WE DO COLLECTIVE. ITEMS. ALRIGHT SO ISSUES THREE AND FIFTEEN HAVE BEEN PULLED IN WILL BE HEARD AT A FUTURE MEETING. WE'RE GOING TO. ADDRESS ISSUES TO FOUR FIFTEEN AND FIFTY. TWO FOUR SIXTEEN AND NINETEEN. SEPARATELY AND SO I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON ISSUES. ONE. FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT NINE TEN ELEVEN TWELVE. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY. BELOW. I FALL. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON TING. BECAUSE OUR MOTION ON ISSUE TO. YOU'RE SUCH. AMONG. BLOOM AYE FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. ISSUE FOR MOTION. BLOOM AYE FONG. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. ISSUE SIXTEEN. HELLO. I FALL. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. AND TO FINALLY ISSUE NINETEEN. THEIR SECOND. HELLO I FALL. GARCIA MULLIN. PATTERSON. TING. THANK YOU OFFER OF BEING HERE WE'RE GONNA HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT NOW AND THANK YOU SO MUCH OF WHO BEEN STANDING AND WAITING FOR BEING PATIENT. THAT WAS IMPRESSIVELY EFFICIENT. JULIA LEVELING WITH A. WITH THE BIO ENERGY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT MORE THAN SEVENTY PUBLIC AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT ARE CONVERTING ORGANIC WASTE TO ENERGY. PRIMARILY TO REDUCE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS EMISSIONS. IT YOU LOOK AT THE STATE'S TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE CHANGE SCOPING PLAN. MORE THEN HALF OF ALL OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS ARE GONNA COME FROM THREE SOURCES THE REDUCTION OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND INCREASE PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS AND REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS FROM THE FREIGHT SECTOR. SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS REDUCTION ALONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN A THIRD OF ALL THE CLIMATE CHANGE REDUCTIONS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO ACHIEVE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF S. B. THIRTY TWO. AND SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. FOR THAT REASON WE URGED THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING FOR CALORIE CYCLE. FROM TWENTY MILLION TWO HUNDRED MILLION PER YEAR WE ALSO A ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR CAL FIRE. SINCE WILDFIRE EMISSIONS NOW EXCEED ALL OF THE CLIMATE CHANGE REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE ACHIEVED IN EVERY OTHER SECTOR COMBINED. AND IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOCATED PORTION OF THAT TO FORCE BIOMASS BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THE DEAD AND DYING TREES AND OTHER FORCE FIELDS. REMOVED TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS. WE STRONGLYSUPPORT THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR DAIRY METHANE REDUCTION. AND WE SUPPORT THE FUNDING FOR OUR INDIAN FOR BIOFUELS. THE LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE ABOUT BIOFUELS. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF REDUCING SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND BIOFUELS TO MEET THE STATE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY IT IS SHOCKING THAT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS PROPOSED. ZERO FUNDING FROM THE A. R. FTTP ZERO FOR BIOFUELS PRODUCTION EVEN THOUGH. BIOGAS FROM DIVERTED ORGANIC WASTE OR DAIRY IS THE ONLY CARBON NEGATIVE FUEL IN EXISTENCE AND THOSE FUELS ARE CRITICAL TO ME ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS STRATEGY AND REQUIREMENTS. WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO WEIGH IN WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND SAY THAT AB EIGHT WHICH REQUIRES MAXIMIZING THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS. AND AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS. THAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS NOT MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT BY ZEROING OUT THE FUNDING FOR BIOFUELS THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE ONE OTHER ITEM UNDER UP. I ITEM PARTY OF OUR AN AGENDA THAT'S CAP AND TRADE BUDGET WE ARE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT AND JUST A MOMENT. SPEAKING TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE SO JULIE MALINOWSKI THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION. IS IT FIRST WE LIKE TO THINK YOU FOR THIS PANEL AND THIS. YOU KNOW THIS LOOKING INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE IT HAS BEEN A DELAY ARENA OUTSTANDING ISSUE. AS WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD THE LEGISLATURE'S GOALS TOFOR EVEY PENETRATION AND AND OF COURSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOALS SO WE WE KNOW THIS IS BEEN COMING AND WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS TRYING TO DO WE HOPE THAT'S. THIS BODY. APPROVES THAT A WE WANNA MAKE TWO POINTS ON THAT THAT THAT WHAT YOU HEARD TODAY AND WHEN THE PANEL SAYS YES THIS THIS MONEY IS ACTUALLY BEING. SHARED WITH PRIVATE INVESTMENT YOU KNOW UTILITIES ARE OUT THERE. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ARE PUTTING LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL INTO IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA IN ALL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS YOU KNOW YOU'RE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE IS ACTUALLY BUILDING JOBS SO THERE'S A TRUE ECONOMIC IMPACT. A POSITIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT WHEN WE INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS AND AND MAKE SURE THAT THE NUMBER OF CHARTERS AVALA FOLLOWING. THAT INCREASING NUMBERS OF VEHICLES SO WE SUPPORT BATON ASK FOR YOUR SPURS WHILE THINKING THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED BIOFUELS ALLIANCE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU BY THE GOVERNOR SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS IS NOTHING SHORT OF A GOTTEN A MANNED OF AB ONE EIGHTEEN. AB ONE EIGHTEEN WAS DESIGNED TO COLLECT FEES FROM. CAR OWNERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND A BALANCED PORTFOLIO OF ALTERNATE ALTERNATIVE FUELS ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS PROPOSAL IS DOING IS SIMPLY MAKING IT. AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE OR HIDE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING PROGRAM. AT THE DISADVANTAGE OF ALL THE OTHER BIOFUEL INDUSTRIES AND SECTORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO REPRESENTING THE BIODIESEL INDUSTRY. THAT IS A DROP IN FUEL REPLACEMENT THAT IS COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL OTHER BIOFUELS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPONSIBLE FOR EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE. REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WERE NOW BEING HUNG OUT TO DRY WITH ZERO DOLLARS. WERE GIVEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BUT THAT'S JUST A ONE YEAR DEAL. FRANKLY WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH THE AB ONE EIGHTEEN MONIES BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY EXIST TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR AND AT LEAST WILL BE ABLE TO FIGHT FOR THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION WHICH IS A PALTRY SUM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LION'S SHARE OF THE WORK THAT THE BIO FUELS INDUSTRY. S. CARING SO WE DON'T OPPOSE. INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE IN FACT WE THINK IT'S NEEDED BUT WE THINK IT SHOULD BE NEEDED AND WE SHOULD BE IT SHOULD BE EVALUATED TO BENEFIT ALL FUELS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE IT ULTIMATELY IF OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND CARBON EMISSIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE STATE AND WE CAN DO THAT BY IMPACTING EVERY VEHICLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT JUST SIXTEEN PERCENT OF THEM. SO WE ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LOOK FOR. SOME OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY PUT SOME INVESTMENT BACK IN TO THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT ARE HELPING THE STATE ACHIEVE ITS GOALS THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING TERRIBLY MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE I'M RYAN RYAN KENNY WITH CLEAN ENERGY. REAL NATION'S LARGEST PROVIDER OF RENEWABLE NASA GAS TRANSPORTATION FUEL AND JUST ECHO IN THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TO DIVERT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM AB ONE EIGHTEEN. AND BACK PHILLIP WITH THAT USE YOUR HALF AS YOU KNOW THAT IS A FUNDING DECISION A COULD BE BUILT ON QUICKSAND BECAUSE FUTURE. FUNDING DECISIONS CAN ALSO BE DEPEND UPON EACH YEAR HALF AND THAT MONEY COULD BE. DIVERTED VERY EASILY TO DO OTHER DECISIONS INCLUDING POLITICAL DECISIONS ALSO MENTION TO THAT ANY DIVERSION. OF THIS THAT MONEY I'D DOES IMPACT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY OF BUSINESS COMMITTEE DOES REACT TO THESE PROPOSALS. AND. NO MARKET CERTAINTY IS EVERYTHING. IN THE IN THE BILE FEELS. INDUSTRY SO WE ASK THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NOT BE I REMOVED AND ALSO I BUILT UPON. WITH OTHER TO YOUR FUNDS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PRODUCTION THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OUT MY NAME IS DOCTOR SHANE STEPHENS I'M A FOUNDER OF FIRST ONLY FUEL. THE LARGEST OWNER OPERATOR OF RETAIL HYDROGEN STATIONS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE HEADQUARTERED IN FOUNDED DOWN IN IRVINE CALIFORNIA. IT'S FOR A CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY. I'M A LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS AGO MY COMPANY RECEIVED ABOUT THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO GO BUILD RETAIL HYDROGEN STATIONS. WE PUT THAT MONEY TO WORK AND WE ACTUALLY BUILT AND OPENED EIGHTEEN HYDROGEN STATIONS. AT A SPEED AND SCALE THAT WAS UNPRECEDENTED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD FOR DEVELOPING HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. TODAY A FUEL CELL CAR OWNER DOWN IN SAN DIEGO CAN DRIVE TO LAKE TAHOE AND SEVEN AND A HALF HOURS WITH JUST HIS FUEL CELL CAR IN A CREDIT CARD. STOPPING A FIELD OF FIVE MINUTES ALONG THE WAY. A AND AND MISTER CHAIRMAN WE I ACTUALLY FOCUS VERY HEAVILY ON ALL OF OUR STATIONS BEING VERY WELL LIT SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE VISITED. OURS SO SORRY ABOUT THAT AND WE'RE WORKING ON THE SIGNAGE THING WE ARE. WE HAVE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED THAT ALL STATIONS ARE NATALIE YEAH. SO ARE SO SINCE WE OPENED FOR STATION WE'VE PERFORMED OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FILLS. NO THAT EQUATES TO TWENTY EIGHT MILLION MILES OF GASOLINE. THAT WERE ELIMINATED AND REPLACED WITH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE MILES. AND THAT TRANSLATES TO SEVENTEEN MILLION POUNDS OF CO TWO AVOIDED. SO PEOPLE ARE BUYING THESE CARS AND PEOPLE ARE DRIVING THE HECK OUT OF THESE CARS WHICH IS GREAT. I AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE SEEING EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A VERY EARLY STAGE IN THE MARKET SOME STRESS HONOR STATIONS. SO OUR OUR FIVE BUSIEST STATIONS GET MAXED OUT. A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK TODAY. ASSEMBLYMAN MULLIN ACTUALLY THE STATION WE VISITED IN YOUR DISTRICT IS ONE OF THOSE FIVE BUSIEST STATIONS SOURCING IT. GET MAX NOW ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO THAT'S OPEN OUR EYES TO THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE. TO SCALE AND I KEEP PACE WITH THE CARS THAT ARE COMING. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE KEEP PACE AND WE WILL ACHIEVE REALLY COMMERCIAL SCALE THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY. THERE'S AN OFF RAMP FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THAT WE CAN BE COST COMPETITIVE WITH GASOLINE. AND YOU KNOW FRANK THAT I BELIEVE THAT SINGLE LINE OF SIGHT TO THE OFFERING FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING SHOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART. OF ANY DISCUSSION IN INVESTMENTS FOR SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE. SO THAT BRINGS TODAY I WE ARE HUGELY SUPPORTERS OF A SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AND. THAT BUDGET REQUEST. WHERE HUSING SUPPORT OF THE WORK THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS DUG HAS DONE AND IS DOING TO BUILD OUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE? AND WE BELIEVE THAT WITH HALF THE MONEY IS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TOWARDS HYDROGEN WE CAN KEEP PACE AND GET THAT EARLY COMMERCIAL SCALE. BY TWENTY THIRTY IN ACHIEVING OFFERING FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING. SO WE ENCOURAGE TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL APPROACH FOR ZEV. TO SEE HOW THE MONEY'S GOOD HYDROGENS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR GOALS THANK YOU. JEAN URBAN REPRESENTING THE ALLIANCE OF AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. THE GOVERNOR'S. COMMITMENT TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S A SEVERE DEFICIT THERE'S NO QUESTION. IT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE DEPLOYMENT IS A VEHICLES. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT INCENTIVES AND AS MISTER BLOOM KNOWS WE HAVE STABILIZE THE HOV STICKER INCENTIVE IS NOW THE TWO POINT OH PROGRAM. VIABLE THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE HAVE ALWAYS LAMENTED THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION FOR THE CV RP WHICH HAS CARVED TESTIFIED AND INTERRUPTED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. WE THINK IT'S A CRITICAL FEATURE THE TO INCENTIVES COMBINED. WILL DO VERY WELL WE THINK HOV ACCESS AND OR THAT THE STICKER. ARE AND OR THE REBATE. THE FIRST TIME EVER WE PENETRATED THE FIVE PERCENT SALES ON ONE HALF OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY ALL DEFERRED A CARBON THIS REMAIN THE PLUG IN HYBRID. SO THEY'RE NOT THE PURE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE THEY REMAIN THE PLUG IN HYBRID. BUT WE NEED HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED THE CVR P. ON AN ANNUAL RELIABLE PREDICTABLE BASIS. I'M ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFINEMENTS. SCARE US A LITTLE. IF THEY'RE DONE TOO QUICKLY OR TOO SEVERELY WE THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE SURGICAL. ON THEY ALSO NEED TO BE LINKED. IF WE'RE NOT DEPLOYING THE INFRASTRUCTURE ON SCHEDULE AS YOU SUGGESTED MISTER MULLIN. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE CUT IN THE REBATE. SO THEY HAVE TO BE DONE AND A THOUGHTFUL WAY IN THE FUTURE BUT ON BALANCE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS WERE WAY AHEAD OF EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE NATION. WE FACE HAD WINS THE LOSS OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT IS GOING TO SURFACE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. STUBBORNLY LOW PRICING GASOLINE. IS A PROBLEM. BUT NOT IT ALL BUT ALL OF THIS CAN BE OVERCOME I THINK WITH DEDICATED REBATES HOV STICKERS AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH PAWN AND WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL. HEART THERE ARE A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES ALREADY A. PROVIDING THE RENEWABLE FUEL NOT THAT IS TAKING OUR ORGANICS. MIXING. PUTTING THEM TAKING THE METHANE OUT AND THEN INJECTING BACK AGAIN. TO FUEL TRUCKS AND MISTER MULLIN KNOWS IT'S ONE OF THE THREE ARE IN HIS DISTRICT. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL SO WE WOULD URGE YOU. BECAUSE IT IS A A NET NEGATIVE BELOW THE ZERO LINE. FUEL THIS A RENEWABLE GAS WE'D URGE YEAR TO JUST TO JUST THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A BET. I PUT DEATH TWENTY FIVE THIRTY MILLION AND FOR THAT TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. AYE BECAUSE IN THIS WAY WE CAN EXPAND THE WHOLE AROUND THE STATE. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA AYE IF WE WERE TO DO THIS WITH SIXTY SEVEN FACILITIES AROUND THE STATE. I WE WOULD BE AYE IN THE CATGORY OF ONE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY. THOUSAND TONS OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS. JUST WITH USING THIS ORGANIC FRAGMENT AND AT FUELING OUR TRUCKS SO WE HAVE THREE COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT ARE DOING THAT AYE WE'D URGENT JUST TO ADJUST THE BUDGET REFLECT PROPERLY. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS BEGINNING TO BLOSSOM AND EXPANDED. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN. TO BRING US DOWN A LITTLE BIT GERMAN BLOOM AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS TODAY. MY NAME IS MIKE LORD I'M AN EXECUTIVE ENGINEER AT. TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA. FOR SO I WANT TO SAY THE TOYOTA BELIEVES IN THE ZERO EMISSION FUTURE AND IS WORKING HARD TO BRING PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET. YET THE MARIAH FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE. AND THE PLUG INTO A. VEHICLE THE PREVIOUS PRIME IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. THIS TRANSITION IS AS DIFFICULT AS WE ALL KNOW AND. DOES REQUIRE SOME GOVERNMENT SUPPORT IN THESE EARLY TRANSITION YEARS. THAT BEING SAID DOT TOYOTA. FULLY SUPPORTS THE GOVERNOR'S A HERE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION INVESTMENT PLAN WHICH INCLUDES BOTH THE NINE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE ON THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION FOR CV RP. AND TIED ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED STATION TARGET. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF STATIONS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NUMBER OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES EXPECTED IN THE MARKET. BOB I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT ALSO REGARDING FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR SOME DISCUSSION ON THE DIFFICULTY. FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN MULTI UNIT WELLINGS AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE A GREAT OPTION FOR THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU FEEL. AT STATIONS OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE JUST LIKE A CONVENTIONAL GASOLINE ELECTRIC VEHICLES A GAS GUZZLING VEHICLE. JUST A COMMENT OR TWO ON THE STATION FUNDING PROCESS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CC. THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON THIS OF WE HOPE AT ONE WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THE FEW THE FUNDS ARE DISPERSED IN A WAY. THAT ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF STATION NETWORKS. ABLE TO CREATE ECONOMIES OF SCALES AND SPUR FASTER MORE EFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATIONS SHOULD BE AWARDED A BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE BECAUSE IT TAKES ABOUT TWO YEARS. TO GET THE STATIONS ARE IN THE GROUND. AND FINALLY WE SUPPORT ALSO THE CURRENT US CC FUNDING PROPOSAL. ALLOCATING NINETY TWO MILLION FOR HYDROGEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THOMAS LOST SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA AFTER GAS VEHICLE COALITION. A WE ALL LIKE TO LINE OUR COMMENTS WITH A MISS LEVIN MISTER BROWN TO MISTER KINNEY. AND WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT. THE COMMENTS BY ILIO WE THINK THAT THEY OFFER OFFERED SOME VERY INTERESTING QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED. A ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WHEN DAD WAS NEW TO THE DISCUSSION IS. YOU KNOW THERE NEEDS TO BE. A SIMILAR FOCUS ON THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE. SECTOR RIGHT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TODAY TALKING ABOUT LIGHT DUTY CARS. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS EXPECTED IT NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I WILL SAVE IT BASED ON A A RP DATA DATA THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN OUT THERE. WE KNOW THAT HAVE TO DO VEHICLES ARE CAUSING THE MOST DAMAGE SO WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TRY TO GET THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THOSE PARTICULAR BUREAU CLASSES CLASS SEVEN AND EIGHT. AND I'LL ALSO SAY WE WILL BE REALLY GREAT FOR I THINK THE MEMBERS AS WELL STAFF TO HEAR IS A PANEL. THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FEATS NEED TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION HAPPEN YOU KNOW WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW ABOUT CONSUMERS. AND I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IT'S LONG OVERDUE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAVE A CONVERSATION TO BIFURCATE THAT AND HAVE A. CONVERSATION ABOUT CONSUMERS TRAFFIC IS GREAT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLEASE NEED FOR THEIR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PURCHASES. THEY PURCHASE VEHICLES IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO KEEP THEM IN AND AND A LONGER AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DUTY CYCLES AND SO CLEAN THOSE UP I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND HAVING A RESOURCES BEHIND THA CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE COOLEY IMPORTANT WE LOOK FOR TO ENGAGE WITH YOU ON THAT IN IN THAT DISCUSSION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS MELISSA AND MO ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN PROPANE GAS ASSOCIATION WE TWO WOULD ECHO PRIOR COMMENTS REGARDING THE NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE OF. AND EXPAND INVESTMENT AND BIOFUELS WHICH PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEETING THE STATE'S ENERGY NEEDS AND GOALS THANK YOU. SCARY MEMBERS DUNCAN MCFETRIDGE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ETHANOL INDUSTRY I DO WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY BIOFUELS. COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A NOTE THAT DOWN. AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW. ETHANOL AND BIOFUELS HAVE BEEN THE WORK WORKFORCE OF THE LC FS. WITHOUT THOSE FUELS WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE CARBON ISING. THE MARKET UNFORTUNATELY ON ON FOR MOST OF OUR FUELS IN PARTICULAR ETHANOL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE FUELS ARE COMING FROM OUT OF STATE WE PRODUCE PROBABLY ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF. TODAY'S ETHANOL IN CALIFORNIA WHICH CONSTITUTES ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF EVERY. GALLON OF GASOLINE IN EVERY CALIFORNIA CAR. WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW WE HAVE MORE JOBS TO. OUR CREATE WE HAVE MORE TECHNOLOGY TO INNOVATE AND WE HAVE NEW FEED STOCKS THAT WE CAN. INTRODUCE INTO THE MARKETPLACE DUSTY CARBON ISING. IF YOU'LL EVEN MORE. WE OPPOSE DIVERTING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO CAP AND TRADE WE THINK WE SHOULD KEEP TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GROW THAT AND ALSO ADD TO THE CAP AND TRADE. WE WOULD WHO CLEARS COMMITTEES. CONSIDERATION OF THAT REQUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ARE CORBELS ON BEHALF OF THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION JUST WANT TO QUICKLY SAY I OF COURSE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON HE CHARGING AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S. AUGMENTED FOCUS ON. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE I JUST QUICKLY ADD. MUCH LIKE MR SOBRE FROM CAL STAR POINTED OUT THAT THE. CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IS STILL A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK. AND WE TWO WOULD WANT TO SEE SOME KIND OF FOCUS ON A INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES GIVEN THAT. THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BAG OF ISSUES THAT REQUIRE SOME INNOVATIVE THINKING AND INTERESTING IDEAS THANK YOU. THANK YOU APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS SO WERE ARE GOING TO NOW I HAVE REPRESENTATION ON THAT THE. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TIME. TO CONSIDER THIS AS WE AS WE GO FORWARD OVER THE COURSE OF. THE BUDGET SESSION. WELCOME STRONGLY THANK YOU. NAM LET ME QUICKLY CHANGE MY OPENING COMMENTS FROM GOOD MORNING TO GOOD AFTERNOON. A GOOD AFTERNOON A MAN ONLY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING A OF ONE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLAR A CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. OTHER PRIORITIES FOR THE CAPITA EXPENDITURE PLAN WERE INFORMED BY SEVERAL CONSIDERATIONS. UP ONE OF WAS CONSISTENCY WITH FEE A. B. A THREE NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES PRIORITIES. A LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED A BETWEEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH SPECIFIED THE FOLLOWING EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES. A AIR TOXIC CAN CRITERIA POLLUTANTS. LOW ZERO A CARBON TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES. SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. HEALTHY FORESTS. SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCY AND CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY RESEARCH. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT WITH HIS PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN AB THREE NINETY EIGHT. IN ADDITION OF THE CAN. ONE OTHER FACTOR OF CONSIDERATION OR BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OUR EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST TO THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES IN THATTHE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL COMPLIES WITH THIS REQUIREMENT. AVAILABILITY OF OTHER FUNDING SOURCES WAS ANOTHER. FEDERATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT. S. B. FIVE THE PROPOSED PARK SOME WATER BOND INCLUDES FUNDING FOR SEVERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY. THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED PREVIOUSLY FROM CAP AND TRADE. SO BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS THE ADMINISTRATION'S CARPENTRY PLAN DOES TWO THINGS. ONE THEY'RE BUILT ON THE FRAMEWORK OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CAP INTRIGUE PACKAGE INTO IT SUPPORTS SEVERAL NEW INITIATIVES. IN TERMS OF BUILDING ON LAST YEAR'S CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE. THE PROPOSAL. CONTINUES THE COMMITMENT TO THE% GOALS OF SIX SEVENTEEN. AND IT PROVIDES A PROPORTIONATE FUNDING TO LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION HEALTHY FOREST. IN CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE. IN ADDITION THE PROPOSAL SO SUPPORT SEVERAL NEW INITIATIVES INCLUDING ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INITIATIVE THAT. WAS JUST DISCUSSED. A CALIFORNIA A INTEGRATED CLIMATE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. IN THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS INITIATIVE. A NO I WAS INTENDING TO TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO US SEVERAL OF MY ADMINISTRATION COLLEAGUES. HERE. TO DISCUSS US OF SEVERAL OF THESE ANDA NEW INITIATIVES A VERY BRIEFLY IN MORE DETAIL BUT BEFORE I DO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO LET THE SUBCOMMITTEE NO THAT LAST WEEK. THE ADMINISTRATION RELEASED ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON CAPTURING AUCTION PROCEEDS THIS REPORT A IS PROVIDED PURSUANT TO AB FIFTEEN THIRTY TWO. OUT WHICH REQUIRES AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THE STATUS OF PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IN THE OUTCOMES. THESE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAM. SOME HIGHLIGHTS ARE THE TO DATE A THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN AWARDED. TWO BILLION DOLLARS SINCE BEEN DISPERSED TO APPROXIMATE A TWO HUNDRED. EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PROJECTS. AND. OVER THE LIFETIME OF THESE IMPLEMENTED PROJECTS THESE INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO REDUCE A A TWENTY THREE MILLION TONS OF GHG A MISSIONS. SO WITH THAT A LET ME. TURN IT OVER MAYBE FIRST TO. WIN THE WINSTON FROM THE STRATEGIC OF COUNSEL. I THINK YOU MATIN THANK YOU. SIMMERING AND IN A COMMITTEE. AS MATT MENTIONED RENTAL ONCE WITH THE STRATEGIC O. COUNCILMAN DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS INITIATIVE. A AND THIS REALLY IS AN EVOLUTION OF OUR EXISTING CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM WHICH OF YOUR APPROPRIATE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WITH A NEW FOCUS ON. A ACCELERATING THE DEPLOYMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF LOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES TOOLS AND APPROACHES. OUR INTENT HERE IS NOT TO DUPLICATE EFFORTS BOTH WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT AND COST ACROSS UBER LEADING INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. BUT REALLY TO PUT A SHARPER FOCUS ON DRAWING FROM THE BEST OF OUR STATES ACADEMIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR INNOVATORS TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. ALTERNATIVES TWO THINGS QUICKLY HERE'S ONE DESCRIBE WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR WITH THE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. SINCE THAT IS REALLY SORT OF THE. THAT THE BRIDGE TO THAT OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND QUICKLY. OR THINKING WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENTS AND PUBLIC PROCESS AND SO WITH THE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM A WE FIRST HAVE TO DEVELOP OF RESEARCH INVESTMENTPLAN IN. AND PUT UP FILL FOR PATIENT A RESEARCH INVESTMENT PLAN WAS REALLY BUILT ON THE STATE'S TWENTY FIFTEEN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM. WE DEVELOPED A DRAFT BACK IN NOVEMBER. TOOK PUBLIC COMMENT AND WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ADOPTED THE RESEARCH PROGRAM ARE AT OUR JANUARY TWENTY NINTH COUNCIL MEETING. RELEASED A SOLICITATION IN FEBRUARY RELIEF EVERY TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT AND THEN WILL HAVE DEADLINES FOR A PROPOSAL ON APRIL THIRTEENTH. AND THEN MAKE AWARD RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR COUNCIL AGAIN THIS IS FOR THE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON A JULY THIRTY FIRST THAT RESEARCH PROGRAM. POINTED TO FOR PRIORITIES. AND THE REALLY MENTION A FIFTH PRIORITY THAT REALLY GETS AT THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE SUPPORTING PROTECTING AFFORDABLE COMMUNITIES FROM THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE A POINT THAT. I WILL GO OUT WITH TO RESEARCH GRANTS IN IN THIS ROUND REALLY TYPES ONE RESEARCH PROJECT GRANTS REALLY EAT GEARED TOWARDS INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHERS AT A. FOCUS ON SPECIFIC TOPICS AT A SMALLER SCALE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO MILLION DOLLAR RANGE AND IN A SECOND CATEGORY OF AWARDS FOCUS ON RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP GRANTS IN THE RANGE OF ONE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY. IN THIS IS REALLY LOOKING TO FUND RESEARCH CONSORTIUM PARTNERSHIP'S COLLABORATIVE'S. TO GET MORE CROSS CUTTING TOPICS BOTTOM. AND RESEARCH ENDEAVORS AT NOW TO JUST BRIEFLY HERE DESCRIBE WITH THINKING BY WAY OF GOVERNANCE AND AND PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THE THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL OF COURSEWE GO THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS TO FULLY DEVELOP. THAT PROGRAM OF THE WITH THE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FORMED AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF. ACADEMIC. RESEARCHERS AND THOSE WHO HAD EXPERTISE WITH REGARD TO EACH OF THE PRIORITIES THAT I MENTIONED A AS WELL AS INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE. CONSISTING OF OUR STATE. STAFF EXPERTS ACROSS THE VARIOUS TOPIC AREAS AND WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IN THEIR EPIC PROGRAM THOSE AIR BEES RESEARCH DIVISION AND THE SP ONE. RESEARCH EFFORTS IN ORDER TO TO TO TO FORM THAT. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I THINK YOU. IF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT CHAIRMAN BLOOM IN THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS TO BE A BARNES I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BANK WHICH WE FINALLY CALL AYE BANK. AND WE ARE HERE TO REQUEST A TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUN. TO FINANCE. PROP UP CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS UNDER AYE BANKS. A CLEAN CENTER THAT STANDS FOR OUR CALIFORNIA LENDING FOR ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS CENTER. AT THAT FINANCING WOULD BE PROVIDED TO US MUNICIPALITIES AND PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS WE CALL MUCH. MARKET. THE AND THE EASE OF FINANCINGS ARE. UP PROVIDED ON A LOW COST BASIS AS AN ADDED INCENTIVE TO ENCOURAGE A THE FINANCING OF THESE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT DEFERRED FOR MANY YEARS. THE CLEAN CENTER PROJECTS INCLUDE GENERALLY ENERGY EFFICIENCY RENEWABLE ENERGY. ENERGY STORAGE WATER ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES ALTERNATIVE FUEL. AND CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. BOTTOM THE FOCUS SPECIFICALLY BUT THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ON. MITIGATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS. THAT EMISSIONS AND TO IMPROVE CLIMATE RESILIENCY SO THAT'S WHY WE CALLED THE PROGRAM AN INTEGRATED PROGRAM TO DO BOTH OF THESE THINGS IT'S AT ITS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR THE SISTINE ABILITY. UP THAT THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THESE LIFE CYCLE. UP PROJECTS. WE. IN PROVIDING THE. LOW COST FINANCING. WE LOOK AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE PROJECTS WILL BE. BUILT. AND WE LOOK AT THE LEVEL OF EMISSIONS FROM THE A VIRUS SCREEN. AND TO THE EXTENT THERE'S MORE POLLUTION IN THIS COMMUNITY WE CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES TO ENCOURAGE A. THE PROJECTS BEING COMPLETED. AND WITH THAT I. WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN SO I I. INADVERTENTLY FILL TO ALLUDE TO ONE OTHER A PROPOSAL THAT IS A NEW PROPOSAL OF RELATIVE TO OTHER CAP AND TRADE PROPOSALS YOU SEEN BEFORE AND THAT IS A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A WE ASKED TO FUND. ADDITIONAL FIRE. ENGINES OF FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM OF REPRESENTS HIM OH YES ARE IN THE AUDIENCE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. BUT I HAVE ONE THAT. IT PSALM. COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND AN UNDERSTANDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOME WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA BE CALLING ON OUR LOCAL CITIES AND DATA AND DO CALLER LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES TO IMPLEMENT A LOT OF OUR. A CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAMS AND A FURTHER OUR GOALS. BUT MANY OF THE CITIES DON'T HAVE THE. DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE YOU'RE A A IN HOUSE. ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT THERE IS THERE ANY FUNDING. UP PROPOSED IN THE UC A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO ADDRESS THAT KIND OF ISSUE. THAT IT ARE YOU A CLARIFICATION I ARE YOU ALLUDING TO THE. REQUIREMENTS OF SET OF. AB SIX SEVENTEEN OR. GONNA REMOTE FOR THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT INTERNALLY SIX OKAY. NOT PARTICULARLY BUT I THINK WHAT WE DO HAVE A AND. RESIDENT FROM THE I THINK A LOOTED IN THE FACT THAT A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS. ARE GOING TO LOCAL AGENCIES IN SUPPORT OF LOCAL AGENCIES A TO TO IMPLEMENT. MULTIPLE PROJECTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. A I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT AS PART OF OUR PROPOSAL WE ARE. PROVIDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO NOT NECESSARILY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT A LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. TO. AS PART OF. THE PUBLIC PROCESS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A PUBLIC PROCESS OF FOR A ACTIONS THAT TO AFFECT THE. OKAY. GETS SICK PLEASE AYE AYE IT ALSO JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THERE'S. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING REQUESTED FOR THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT I BANK JUST. AT AS HOW WE OPERATE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ALONG THE WAY. TO ADD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH TO DO A FINANCING SAID THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS MORE IN LINE WITH. HELPING THEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO THE FINANCING REMINDING THEM ABOUT SEQUEL. AND AT REMINDING THEM OF AYE THERE. AT REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN HELPING THEM TO GET TO THE RIGHT. A. ADVISERS WE DON'T PROVIDE THE ADVICE SPECIFICALLY BUT WE HELP THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND. WE DO NOT THAT'S JUST HOW WE OPERATE WE DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS OUT LOUD BUBBLY TONE HERE BUT IT'S ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THAT SIR THAT RECORD NOW. YOU MAY BE THE FIRST THIS YEAR. AND THE LAST. NO BUT THE HAVE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING I THINK WE MIGHT WANT TO BE THINKING ABOUT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE. THROUGH THE CYCLE MISTER MULLIN. MISS SHARE I COULD JUST ADD UP MY VOICE TO THAT SINCE WE'VE. OPEN UP THE AB SIX ONE SEVEN. A WINDOW HERE I WAS CONTACTED BY THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. NO WE PUT SOME ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON THE WORK OF THESE REGIONAL. AND LOCAL ENTITIES. THERE'S DISCUSSION OF THIRTEEN MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION AN ON GOING COSTS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED. I OUT OF THE EXPENDITURE PLANS SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO JUST GIVE SOME ADDITIONAL ATTENTION TO. YOU KNOW THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WE PUT IT UP ON. LOCAL ENTITIES FROM THIS BUILDING TO MEET OUR GOALS AND IT SHOULD BE REFLECTED APPROPRIATELY IN THE AREA EXPENDITURE PLAN SO I'D LOOK FOR TO IT SOME ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THAT TOPIC. THANK YOU AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS FROM THE ALEJO AFTER WHICH WILL HAVE. PUBLIC. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND JUST BEFORE I BRIEFLY GO OVER OUR MAIN COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT IS GOING TO PROVIDE JUST A BIT MORE CONTEXT ON FOR THE OVERALL SPENDING PACKAGE I KNOW THE FOCUS IS HERE IS PRIMARILY ON KIND OF THAT DISCRETIONARY PEACE AND SO. IT'S TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BETTER SINCE I DIDN'T BELIEVE MY COLLEAGUE HANDED OUT A COPY OF OUR. BUDGET REPORT AYE IN THAT REPORT ON PAGE ELEVEN WE HAVE A TABLE THAT SUMMARIZES BOTH LAST YEAR SPENDING PLAN AS WELL AS THIS ONE ZERO ABLE TO COME TO COMPARE HOW THE TWO. ARE ALIKE AND DIFFERENT I ALSO INCLUDES KIND OF THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS WHICH ROLE ARE STILL ON GOING AS WELL AS A LAYING OUT SOME OF THE EXISTING COMMITMENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION THAT WERE MADE AND PREVIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION SO. OVERALL THE ENTIRE PACKAGE IS ABOUT OUT TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION SORT OF UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS SO. JUST ONE INTO A KIND OF. SET THE STAGE THERE ARE MOVING JUST DISCRETIONARY PIECE AND I THINK OVERALL IT OUR VIEW IS THAT THE. PLAN FINDS A LOT OF THE. THE SAME PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S PLANS WAS VERY SIMILAR IN A LOT OF WAYS. SOME OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT. A COUPLE OF OTHERS WE WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT REAL QUICK OTHERS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS LASTS FOR FREIGHT AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND LAST YEAR'S PROGRAM SO THAT'S ONE. AREA YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME TO TAKE A LOOK OUT IN A. PROBE ABOUT KIND OF THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. THERE'S ALSO SOME PROGRAMS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING LAST YEAR THAT DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S PLAN INCLUDING SOME CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROGRAMS. WHICH MAY BE RECEIVING FUNDING THROUGH SOME OTHER POTS BUT WHEN A DEATH LIKE THAT AS WELL AS SOME OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM WHICH YOU. HEARD ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. I ALSO JUST WANT OTHER NOTABLE FEATURE OF THIS PLAN AND YOU ALSO HEARD ABOUT THAT IN EARLIER ITEM. OF THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN. MULTI YEAR FUNDING SO INSTEAD OF JUST THE ONE YEAR FUNDING WHICH HAS BEEN TYPICAL AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM. ABOUT TWENTY MILLION FOR THE CD R. P. PROGRAM. AND MULTI YEAR FUNDING SOULS A COUPLE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT I UP TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION INCOME MULTI YEAR FUNDING AND SO. I JUST LOOKING AT THE OUT YEARS A OF SPENDING IF YOU'RE ASSUME THAT OF THE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ASSUMES CONTINUE GOING FORWARD IN THE OUT YEARS OF ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. THE COMMITMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE SO FAR ALREADY AND IF THIS. PROPOSALS ADOPTED WOULD TOTAL ABOUT ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ON KIND OF AND. ON ANNUAL BASIS AND SO EIGHT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION EXCUSE ME. AND YOU KNOW IF IF REVENUES ARE ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR BILLION THAT LEAVES ABOUT YOU KNOW SIX HUNDRED MILLION OR SO AND OF ON GOING FOR THESE OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN FUN IN THE PAST SO THAT JUST. I THINK SOME IMPORTANT PEOPLE MIND THROUGH THE LONG RUN WHAT YOU'RE COMMITTING TO WONDER. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL WHAT YOU WOULD BE COMMITTING TO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. SO OUR OUR GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS OUR FIRST JUST TO ENSURE THAT THE ALLOCATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR PRIORITIES ARE NOT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A VARIETY OF PRIORITIES WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE. FUNDING PLAN BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS WELL AS LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS CLIMATE ADAPTATION OTHER THINGS SO JUST. I'M SURE THAT KIND OF THIS PACKAGE KIND OF AND MEETS THOSE PRIORITIES AND FITS. WITH THOSE PRIORITIES. IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS WELL AS AS THE OUT YEAR WHICH I TALKED ABOUT JUST A MINUTE AGO. HOW ARE AND KIND OF IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THAT JUST BASED ON WHAT THOSE PRIORITIES R. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOR THE LEGISLATURE THAT GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOMPLISHING AND WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE? MISTER ONLY MENTIONED THEIR RECENTLY RELEASED ANNUAL REPORT. THAT TRIES ESTIMATES SOME OF THE GHG OUTCOMES I'LL ONE THING THAT WE HAVE A NOTED JUST GIVEN SOME OF THE INTEREST IN A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS. THAT REPORT STILL DOESN'T ESTIMATES THAT CO BENEFITS THINGS LIKE A REDUCTIONS IN LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS OTHER TYPES OF BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CLIMATE ADAPTATION OR WATER OR OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT. I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED THEY'RE CONTINUING TO COME TO WORK ON THAT BUT THAT'S AN AREA WHERE YOU MIGHT WANNA ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO. COMMENT ON ITS PROGRESS INVESTMENT IN THOSE THINGS ECONOMIC BETTER SENSE OF WHAT. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOMPLISHING. AND THEN FINALLY. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER ITS OPTIONS FOR ENSURING FUND'S SOLVENCY SO SOME OF THE NUMBERS HERE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS ASSUMING TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TWO POINT FOUR BILLION IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND UNDER THE SPENDING PLAN IT WOULD SPEND. ALMOST ALL OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES IF THAT'S THE REVENUE THAT COMES AND LEAVING ARE A VERY VERY SMALL FUND BALANCE. AND SO THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN THE VOLATILITY IN REVENUE IN THE PAST WE THINK. IS REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND ACTUALLY WE THINK REVENUE IS LIKELY TO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN THIS BUT GIVEN THE VOLATILITY THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF. THERE'S STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY AROUND REVENUE AND SOME CHANCE THAT REVENUE COULD COME IN A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN. EXPECTED SO THINK ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WE THINK IT'S BEFORE TO A REASONABLE PROPOSAL FOR MOST OF THE PROGRAMS OF REVENUE COMES IN LOWER THERE WOULD BE A OF PROPORTIONAL REDUCTION AND SOME OF THE ALLOCATIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. WITH A COUPLE OF EXCEPTIONS. PROGRAMS OPERATED THROUGH CAL FIRE THE HEALTHY FOREST PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD PROGRAMS WOULD BE MADE WHOLE WOULD BE KEPT HOLE IN THE OTHER PROGRAMS WOULD BE REDUCED PROPORTIONATELY SO. AGAIN I THINK THAT'S JUST AN AREA WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT'S A FEAT THAT'S A. AN ASPECT OF THIS PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER. WHETHER OR NOT NIKADA PRIORITIZING THOSE PROGRAMS IN AND IN IN A SCENARIO WHERE REVENUE COMES IN LOWER IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES THOSE PROGRAMS RELATED TO THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE NOT A PART OF THIS PACKAGE. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU COULD. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF YOU THINK THAT THE. ADMINISTRATIONS REVENUE. PROJECTIONS ARE REASONABLE EVEN THOUGH THE. MOST RECENT AUCTIONS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE A LITTLE ROSIER THAN. THAN ORIGINALLY PROJECTED AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF SOME VOLATILITY. AND THE. OUT YEARS THAT'S RIGHT YEAH I MEAN WE WE THINK THEY'RE KIND OF REASONABLE GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHAT REVENUES CAN BE AND I THINK OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS THAT THEY WROTE THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE ALL OF THE HIGHER A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION. IS PROPOSING BUT AGAIN YET GIVEN THAT VOLATILITY WOULD YOU THINK THEY'RE KIND OF WITHIN A REASONABLE RANGE. IN THE A QUESTIONS. CSUS IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND. APPARENTLY THERE IS. FOLKS WERE. WE'RE WE'RE RUNNING. LATE INTO THE DAY AND. WE HAVE LOTS OF TIME TO CONSIDER ALL OF YOUR ISSUES SO. I WANT TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU BUT KEEP IT AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE A POSSIBLE PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND HERE TO TALK ABOUT CAL RECYCLES FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM. DESPITE PROVEN SUCCESS AND AND SUSTAIN DEMANDS THE ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET HAS PROPOSED TO CUT POWER CYCLES FUNDING AND HALF AT A TIME WHERE WE ACTUALLY NEED TO INCREASE THE SPENDING. THE PROJECTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM PROVIDE THE CRITICAL PUBLIC AND INVESTMENT THAT CITIES NEED TO MEET THEIR ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING AND EDIBLE FOOD WASTE PREVENTION AND RESCUE REQUIREMENTS SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE. MOREOVER THE COLLAPSE OF THE CHINESE RECYCLING MARKETS. ARE AFFECTING EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN THE STATE. AND THIS HAS SHOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING SUSTAINABLE MARKETS. AT DOMESTIC MARKETS AND WE BELIEVE IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FUNDING FOR CAL RECYCLES PROGRAMS IS A REALLY GREAT INVESTMENT BUT WITH THEY'VE ALSO PROVEN TO BE AMONG THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE. AND. OVERSUBSCRIBED OF ANY DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN WHEN WE COME BACK WE'LL SEE THE RECORDING. I DID WANT TO JUST MENTION I'M HERE ON THE MONEY WASN'T OF THAT I'M I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A. TREE DAVIS TODAY. IN SUPPORT OF A LARGE COALITION ASK. WHICH WE DISTRIBUTED THE THE OFFICIAL LETTER TO TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION NATURAL RESOURCE INVESTMENTS. WHICH AS STAFF POINTS OUT IN IN THE COMMENTS. WAS LEFT OUT OF THE MINISTRATION PROPOSAL. AND WE DO AGREE THAT THAT IT DOES MERIT. INCLUSION IN THE FINAL PACKAGE THAT COMES TOGETHER. AND SPECIFICALLY UM'S CITY. OR TREE DAVIS. WORKS A LOT WITH YOUR BEFORE SHE PROGRAM. AND ALTHOUGH OUR NAME SAYS THAT. TREE DAVIS WE DON'T JUST DO WORK IN THE CITY OF DAVIS WE DO WORK IN THE ENTIRE EAGLE COUNTY.

ADDITIONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE FUNDING FOR S. B. TEN THIRTEEN BY SENATOR LARA WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS WILL INCENTIVIZE EARLY ADOPTION OF CLIMATE FRIENDLY COOLING SYSTEMS TO REPLACE THE USE OF HSCS. IT JUST THESE ARE THE FASTEST GROWING SOURCE OF GIGI IS IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD AND CAN BE THOUSANDS OF TIMES MORE POTENT THAN CO TWO AND THEIR HEAT TRAPPING AND CLIMATE WARMING. AND ABILITIES FINALLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME FUNDING FOR S. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BY SENATOR STERN TO HELP INCENTIVIZE MARKET TRANSFORMATION FOR A LOW IN ZERO EMISSIONS BUILDING TECHNOLOGY IS.

SUPPORT AND AND AN INCREASE IS POSSIBLE THE FUNDING FOR A LOW CARBON TRANSLATION PROGRAM A CARP NOTIFIED AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE H. IT REBATE PROGRAM WHICH IS GOING TO CRITICAL FOR. TRANSIT OPERATORS TO TRANSITION IS YOUR MISSION BUT ALSO CONSIDER FUNDING PROGRAM FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER IF THE NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THERE'S NEVER STRUCTURES NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE FEELINGS SYSTEMS BUT IT'S ALSO FOR THE MAINTENANCE FACILITIES UPGRADES AS WELL AS WORKFORCE TRAINING SO HURT YOUR SUPPORT FOR THAT. MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE EQUITY COALITION WHICH SEEKS TO CHANNEL CLIMATE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY FACED BOTH DISINVESTMENT AND A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF POLLUTION. AYE YOU HAVE OUR OUR LETTER WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. OUT WE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROJECTS THAT ARE BRINGING CLEAN MOBILITY TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT ON LIGHT DUTIES US IS NOT MATCHED ON THE HEAVY DUTY SIDE. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM BOTH ALEJO AND YOUR OWN STAFF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ACTUALLY CUT THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE FUNDING IN HALF. FROM THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH WOULD LEAVE NO MONEY FOR PORT AND FREIGHT EQUIPMENT. SO WE ARE ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM TO REDUCE THE DIESEL EXHAUST. THAT IS CHOKING OUR COMMUNITIES WE ALSO AGREE WITH THOSE WHO HAVE SPOKEN IN FAVOR OF THE LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM. WHICH ALSO BY THE WAY INCLUDES ROOFTOP SOLAR. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. THIS PROGRAM REDUCES ENERGY BILLS ANTS EMISSIONS AND ALSO CREATES JOB OPPORTUNITIES. WE ALSO A DISAGREE WITH THIS HEARING OUT OF THE FUNDING FOR URBAN FORESTRY IN URBAN GREENING. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THOSE NEEDS ARE FILLED BY PROP SIXTY EIGHT. ARE THESE ARE STREET LEVEL PROGRAMS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT THE PROP SIXTY EIGHT PROGRAMS AND DESERVE TO BE FUNDED.

OUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S SO FAR IS UNBALANCED AND THAT A SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED. A LOT OF MONEY RIGHT NOW IS GOING TOWARD SAYS REMISSION VEHICLES MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY. AND THAT IS GONNA TAKE UP TO. A LONG TIME AT THE TEN YEARS POSSIBLY OR MORE TO REALLY GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE RANGE AND. THE TECHNOLOGY UP TO SPEED AYE IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LOOK AT AN URGENT REDUCTION AND COST EFFECTIVE REDUCTION FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND KNOCKS. OUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT LOW KNOCKS VEHICLES WITH RENEWABLE FUEL. WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO. ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES CAN COST FIVE TIMES MORE THAN AID LOW KNOCKS OUT OF THE TRUCK. MEDIAN DETER HEAVY DUTY SO WE DO URGE INCREASE IN A TOLL FUNDING FOR LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION.

RELATED TO THE TYPES OF THE AMOUNT OF EMISSIONS FROM IN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES EACH YEAR THEY MAKE UP TWENTY THREE PERCENT. OF ANNUAL MISSIONS OUT OF THAT FORTY PERCENT THAT COMES FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHILE ONLY MAKING UP THREE PERCENT OF VEHICLES ON A ROAD SO THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION BENEFITS ARE TREMENDOUS.
