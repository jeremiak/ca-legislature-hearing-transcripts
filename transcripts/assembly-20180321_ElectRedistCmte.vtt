PASS ANY TAX.

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:06.904 region:rollup2
THAT LAW ALREADY EXISTS.

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:08.806 region:rollup2
THAT'S A LIE.

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:10.441 region:rollup2
BUT YET IT'S GREAT TALKING POINT

00:45:08.806 --> 00:45:12.043 region:rollup2
TRYING GATHER A SIGNATURE.

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:13.211 region:rollup2

00:45:12.043 --> 00:45:14.178 region:rollup2
THE SENATE ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES

OR SOMEONE FROM OUTSIDE OF HIS

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:17.815 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:19.183 region:rollup2
IT'S COMING IN.

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:21.385 region:rollup2
PUSHING OF INITIATIVE ARE TO

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:23.054 region:rollup2
HAVE A FOR RECALL THEY QUALIFIED

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:25.022 region:rollup2
THAT RECALL AND AGAIN A LOT OF

00:45:23.054 --> 00:45:26.424 region:rollup2
THE CONCERNS FROM WHAT WE'VE

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:27.491 region:rollup2
BEEN HEARING. IS THAT.

00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:29.193 region:rollup2
REPEAL THE GAS TAX BUT

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.295 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY WAS A.

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:32.897 region:rollup2
IT NOT. OBVIOUSLY TO REPEAL THE

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:34.465 region:rollup2
GAS TAX IT WAS TO SIGN A

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:35.433 region:rollup2
PETITION TO CALL FOR RECALL ON

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:38.302 region:rollup2
THE SEA SENATOR.

00:45:35.433 --> 00:45:40.037 region:rollup2
AND SO. YOU KNOW I I.

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:41.505 region:rollup2
IT AN AND AGAIN YOU KNOW JUST

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:42.974 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR VETOED THE

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:44.175 region:rollup2
BILL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT A

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:45.376 region:rollup2
GOOD IDEA TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON

00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.977 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE LIKE THIS HOUSE TWO

00:45:45.376 --> 00:45:47.144 region:rollup2
THOUSAND ELEVEN IT SEVEN YEARS

00:45:45.977 --> 00:45:48.846 region:rollup2
AGO.

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:50.915 region:rollup2
I RAN THE SAME BILL TWO YEARS IN

00:45:48.846 --> 00:45:51.816 region:rollup2
A ROW FOR YOUR GOT AT A VETO. ON

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:54.118 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO TRY THE SECOND YEAR YOU

00:45:51.816 --> 00:45:55.786 region:rollup2
SIGNED IT SO ARE AND I THINK THE

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.754 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH THE GOVERNOR

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:57.922 region:rollup2
VETOED THE BILL THE FIRST TIME

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:59.357 region:rollup2
AROUND VERSUS THE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:45:57.922 --> 00:46:00.091 region:rollup2
TODAY WHAT WE ARE SEEING MORE

00:45:59.357 --> 00:46:01.359 region:rollup2
ISSUES WITH THE.

00:46:00.091 --> 00:46:02.927 region:rollup2
WITH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND

00:46:01.359 --> 00:46:04.528 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING INTO

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.496 region:rollup2
OUR STATE OR THAT ARE ALREADY IN

00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:07.398 region:rollup2
OUR STATE WE THINK ABOUT THE

00:46:05.496 --> 00:46:08.499 region:rollup2
HOUSING ISSUES AND THE END OF IN

00:46:07.398 --> 00:46:10.935 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVES ARE BEING PUSHED

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:12.670 region:rollup2
BY INDIVIDUALS IN THE LA COUNTY.

00:46:10.935 --> 00:46:13.638 region:rollup2
TO KEEP THEIR VIEW FROM BEING

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.972 region:rollup2
BLOCKING SOLIS THAT'S THAT'S BUT

00:46:13.638 --> 00:46:16.173 region:rollup2
RUN A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE I'M

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:17.575 region:rollup2
MILLIONAIRE I GOT A LINE MONEY

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.809 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T WANT MY VIEW

00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:19.777 region:rollup2
OBSTRUCTED SOMEONE WHY PASS

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.778 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THAT YOU CAN BUILD

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:22.046 region:rollup2
ANYTHING YET WE HAVE AN

00:46:20.778 --> 00:46:23.447 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE. HOUSING CRISIS THE

00:46:22.046 --> 00:46:24.615 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WAS

THEY GOT DEFEATED.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:27.084 region:rollup2
BUT STILL QUALIFY BECAUSE HE

00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:28.853 region:rollup2
HAD THE MONEY TO GET THE

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:31.188 region:rollup2
SIGNATURE SO THERE'S A REALLY

00:46:28.853 --> 00:46:33.190 region:rollup2
BIG ISSUE NO HUGE DISCONNECT.

OF THE FLAWS OF OUR. OUR OUR

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:13.624 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ITSELF THE PETITIONS THE

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:15.126 region:rollup2
THE ISSUES OF PEOPLE NOT TELLING

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:17.128 region:rollup2
THE TRUTH SOME FOLKS HAVE

00:48:15.126 --> 00:48:18.763 region:rollup2
SEVERAL. OF PETITIONS AND I'VE

00:48:17.128 --> 00:48:20.297 region:rollup2
BEEN THERE TO SEE THE MALL WITH

00:48:18.763 --> 00:48:21.232 region:rollup2
A ROLL THEM OUT TO YOU AND I

00:48:20.297 --> 00:48:22.666 region:rollup2
DON'T DO THEM.

00:48:21.232 --> 00:48:24.168 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ALWAYS THERE'S A

00:48:22.666 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
LOT OF THAT I'M NOT SURE OF THIS

00:48:24.168 --> 00:48:27.571 region:rollup2
BILL SOLVES THAT PROBLEM THAT'S

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.039 region:rollup2
MY CONCERN IS THAT IF I WANTED

00:48:27.571 --> 00:48:29.507 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT THE FLAWS IN THE

00:48:29.039 --> 00:48:31.409 region:rollup2
IN THE WHOLE SYSTEM OF

00:48:29.507 --> 00:48:33.177 region:rollup2
PETITIONS.

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:35.112 region:rollup2
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I'M

00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:37.615 region:rollup2
NOT SURE IF IF IF SAYING YOU

00:48:35.112 --> 00:48:38.983 region:rollup2
CAN'T BE INCENTIVIZE TO COLLECT

00:48:37.615 --> 00:48:40.451 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF.

00:48:38.983 --> 00:48:42.486 region:rollup2
SIGNATURES YOU GET.

00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:42.887 region:rollup2
BUT WE CAN PAY BY THE HOUR TO

00:48:42.486 --> 00:48:45.022 region:rollup2
DO IT.

00:48:42.887 --> 00:48:45.956 region:rollup2
I AM NOT SURE IF IF THAT SOLVES

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:48.092 region:rollup2
MY PROBLEM.

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:49.994 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THE PETITION THE

00:48:48.092 --> 00:48:51.729 region:rollup2
SITUATION STILL EXISTS PROBABLY

00:48:49.994 --> 00:48:53.130 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:48:51.729 --> 00:48:54.498 region:rollup2
PAY PEOPLE BY THE HOUR. A WHICH

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.833 region:rollup2
IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY.

00:48:54.498 --> 00:48:57.835 region:rollup2
WOULD PROBABLY DO THAT.

00:48:55.833 --> 00:48:59.303 region:rollup2
AND WOOD STILL IN THAT WITH ALL

00:48:57.835 --> 00:49:00.471 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS TAKING PLACE ALL

00:48:59.303 --> 00:49:02.306 region:rollup2
YOU HIRE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE

00:49:00.471 --> 00:49:03.674 region:rollup2
AGGRESSIVE ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHY

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:05.142 region:rollup2
YOU PAYING ABOUT OUR MEGA

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:06.710 region:rollup2

00:49:10.881 --> 00:49:12.883 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS?

00:49:11.448 --> 00:49:14.151 region:rollup2
ARE THEY MAY EXACERBATE THE

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:16.787 region:rollup2
PROBLEM WITH ANYTHING.

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:18.255 region:rollup2
BUT AND AND IT DOESN'T ADDRESS

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:19.623 region:rollup2
AT ALL ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:21.292 region:rollup2
PETITION PROCESS

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:22.493 region:rollup2
SOME INTEGRITY IN THE PETITIONS

00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:24.061 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE YEAR HOW THEY'RE

00:49:22.493 --> 00:49:25.863 region:rollup2
ADVERTISED TO INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:27.431 region:rollup2
THE NOT THERE'S. NO THEY HAVE TO

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:28.899 region:rollup2
BE TRUTHFUL ABOUT IT THEY CAN

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:30.634 region:rollup2
MAYBE ONLY CURE ONE PETITION

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:32.236 region:rollup2
WHATEVER IT IS BUT I'M NOT SURE

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:34.138 region:rollup2
IF THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM IT IT

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:35.506 region:rollup2
IT MAKES US FEEL BETTER. A BUT

00:49:34.138 --> 00:49:38.209 region:rollup2
IT MAY MAKE THE WHOLE PROCESS

00:49:35.506 --> 00:49:39.577 region:rollup2
BECOME MORE OF DIFFICULT AND AND

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:40.511 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY VERY EFFECTIVE

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:41.979 region:rollup2
OF THERE NEEDS TO BE A

00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:43.981 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WHOLE

00:49:41.979 --> 00:49:45.416 region:rollup2
IDEA. OF THE OF THE CITIZEN

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:47.017 region:rollup2
PETITION WITHIN THAT THAT IS AN

00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:48.319 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO AND

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:49.787 region:rollup2
WHERE IT AND UNDER WHAT

00:49:48.319 --> 00:49:50.588 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD EXIST. AND

00:49:49.787 --> 00:49:52.189 region:rollup2
MAYBE THERE MAY BE MORE

00:49:50.588 --> 00:49:53.891 region:rollup2
RESTRICTIONS OR SOMETHING PLACED

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:55.292 region:rollup2
ON THOSE WHO COME UP WITH WITH

00:49:53.891 --> 00:49:57.027 region:rollup2
WITH THESE PETITIONS AND HOW

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.862 region:rollup2
THEY MARKETED IN ALL KINDS OF

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.530 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:49:57.862 --> 00:50:01.198 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT SURE OF THE SOLVE

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:03.000 region:rollup2
ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS I THINK IT

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:03.767 region:rollup2
IT IT IT IT IT APPROACHES IT BUT

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.469 region:rollup2
IT REALLY DOESN'T SOLVE THE

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:07.238 region:rollup2
PROBLEM BECAUSE PEOPLE GENERALLY

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:08.205 region:rollup2
FIND A WAY AROUND IT. AND I

00:50:07.238 --> 00:50:09.874 region:rollup2
THINK MOST FOLKS ARE SAYING THAT

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:12.610 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PROCESS WHILE IT HAD

00:50:09.874 --> 00:50:14.378 region:rollup2
SOME INITIAL VALUE IN TERMS OF

HELPING THE CITIZENS HAVE

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:18.482 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT.

00:50:15.846 --> 00:50:20.284 region:rollup2
ANIME ALSO CALL AND IT AND THE

00:50:18.482 --> 00:50:23.587 region:rollup2
PETITION PROCESS IS CALLED MANY

00:50:20.284 --> 00:50:24.755 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NOT TO BE AS ENGAGED AS A

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:28.893 region:rollup2
VOTING FOLKS OUT OF OFFICE. WE

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:29.860 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK OF DOING A VERY GOOD

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:32.830 region:rollup2
JOB.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.831 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A TENDENCY ONE RIGHT

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:35.900 region:rollup2
THE LAWS THEMSELVES WHICH

00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:39.537 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE A LOT MORE

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:41.005 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS THAN ANYTHING ELSE

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:43.974 region:rollup2
AND MOST OF THEM INTO BEING

BUT I'M GONNA AYE I THINK THE

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.784 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SHOULD GO FORWARD.

00:50:53.017 --> 00:50:54.718 region:rollup2

00:59:51.188 --> 00:59:55.559 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY.

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:59.129 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW

00:59:55.559 --> 01:00:00.464 region:rollup2
FOR US TO. LOWER THE BARRIERS OF

00:59:59.129 --> 01:00:02.466 region:rollup2

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:04.134 region:rollup2

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:12.609 region:rollup2
MATERNITY TO PARTICIPATE WHETHER

FRAME.

01:00:16.513 --> 01:00:21.418 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE.

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:23.954 region:rollup2
SO WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO.

01:00:21.418 --> 01:00:24.855 region:rollup2
LOWER AS MANY BEERS TO ENTRY.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:26.690 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:28.892 region:rollup2
WAS IT POINTED OUT IN EVERY

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:29.860 region:rollup2

BE ABLE ASK.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.510 region:rollup2
IS WHAT WAS THE FIGURE YOU SAID.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.681 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY TWENTY FOURTEEN.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:26.416 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER I'M GOING TO GIVE IS

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:28.051 region:rollup2

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.623 region:rollup2
EASIER

01:01:31.121 --> 01:01:35.125 region:rollup2
SO THEY DON'T SUPPORT THIS THEN

01:01:33.623 --> 01:01:35.992 region:rollup2
YOU BUT I'D LIKE TO INCREASE

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:38.695 region:rollup2
HIGHER NOT TO ENTRY IN THAT IS

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:39.496 region:rollup2
OKAY. LOOK THE QUESTION I HAD IS

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.964 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CITED A FIGURE.

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:42.866 region:rollup2
AND I DID NOT CATCH THAT THAT

01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:44.568 region:rollup2
WAS THE VOTER PROSPECT

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:45.735 region:rollup2

FOURTEEN HE OPENED WITH IT YES.

01:01:47.837 --> 01:01:56.313 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THE PERCENTAGE?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:57.914 region:rollup2
THEN TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN THE

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:59.983 region:rollup2
PRIMARY TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN.

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.850 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.986 region:rollup2
IT WAS TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THE

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.854 region:rollup2
PRIMER TWENTY FOURTEEN.

01:02:02.986 --> 01:02:05.622 region:rollup2
AND MISTREAT YOU PERCENT OF

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:07.224 region:rollup2
REGISTERED VOTERS PARTICIPATING

01:02:05.622 --> 01:02:08.959 region:rollup2
THAT AND THAT WAS A FORTY TWO

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:10.794 region:rollup2
PERCENT IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:12.429 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR I WOULD THINK YOU'D

01:02:10.794 --> 01:02:13.997 region:rollup2
BE VERY IMPORTANT.

01:02:12.429 --> 01:02:15.765 region:rollup2
UPDATE THE COMMITTEE THAT IN

01:02:13.997 --> 01:02:16.633 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR BY SIXTEEN.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.535 region:rollup2
THE VOTER RATE HAD INDEED

01:02:16.633 --> 01:02:20.170 region:rollup2
SKYROCKETED.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:21.204 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT WITHIN THE

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.606 region:rollup2

ELECTION.

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:26.676 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE VOTER

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:28.378 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION RATE HAS FAR MORE

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:30.046 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH VOTERS INTEREST IN

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:31.815 region:rollup2
VOTING FOR CANDIDATE AGAINST A

INITIATIVE AGAINST THE BALLOT

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.918 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:36.753 region:rollup2
BASED UPON THEIR INFORMATION ON

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:38.255 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY FEEL QUALIFIES HIM TO

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.789 region:rollup2
BE A VOTER IN A PARTICULAR

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:40.824 region:rollup2

AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE. THAT

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.736 region:rollup2
ANYBODY ESPECIALLY MY COLLEAGUES

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.937 region:rollup2
ON THE OTHER SIDE THE AISLE

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:19.215 region:rollup2
TO BUSINESSES IF.

DON'T SEE GOVERNMENT AS AN

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.062 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE PLACE TO CREATE CHANGE

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:34.764 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT. ONE

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:36.065 region:rollup2
PARTY IN ANOTHER PARTY FIGHTING

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:36.1000 region:rollup2

01:05:36.1000 --> 01:05:39.469 region:rollup2
I'M RIGHT YOU'RE WRONG AND

01:05:38.301 --> 01:05:42.305 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT THAT'S GOVERNMENT.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:44.808 region:rollup2
BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:46.810 region:rollup2
