SURE SENATOR ACQUIRE BE HERE SHORTLY [inaudible] BUT OVERALL [inaudible] EIGHTY EIGHT OUR CAL STOCK TO FILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF CHAPTER NINE THIRTY FOUR STATUTES OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN OR SENATE BILL. TEN TWENTY NINE SENATE BILL TEN TWENTY NINE REQUIRES CAL STAR IN CONSULTATION WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. TO CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NORTH COAST RAILROAD AUTHORITY TO DETERMINE THE MOST APPROPRIATE WAY. TO DISSOLVE THE AUTHORITY AND TO DISPENSE WITH ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SPECIFICALLY WE ARE REQUESTING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO DJ US TO COMPLETE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATION TO CONDUCT DEBT LIABILITIES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND LITIGATION ASSESSMENTS. AND ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTRACT FOR THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF THE VIABILITY OF CONSTRUCTING A TRAIL. THIS INCLUDES RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO OPTIONS FOR REAL BANKING.

AN AUDIT FOR THE DEBT LIABILITIES OBLIGATION AND LITIGATION ASSESSMENT HUSBAND SCHEDULED WITH -- SAY TO BEGIN JULY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN UPON APPROVAL OF THIS B. C. P.. AND AS PART OF THE EARLY WORK. OUR GROUP IS LEARNING ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE REAL THE STORIES COMPANIES JOINT POWERS AND DISTRICT INVOLVED ALONG WITH THE EXISTING CONDITION OF THE CORRIDOR. WE ARE VETTING SPECIFIC SCOPE OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES WITH EACH AGENCY. SO THAT WITH APPROVAL OF THE BCP WE CAN BEGIN ASSESSMENTS IN EARLY JULY. INCOMPLETE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY AS REQUIRED BY SB. TEN TWENTY NINE THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE GET TAYLOR I HAVE A DIFFERENT QUESTION. IT'S A REAL ROAD. I'M GOOD I PRESUME YOU TAKE OUT THE RAIL HE PUT THE TRAIL IN THIS YOU KNOW I I REALIZE IT'S BEEN THERE AWHILE BUT BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW IT WORKS. SO. TELL ME ABOUT THE DISTINCTION THAT YOU'RE MAKING BETWEEN CULINARY ASSESSMENT ON THE VIABILITY THAT MILLION DOLLARS VERSUS THE THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLYPHONY. IF YOU DO THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT WOULD MEAN YOU NORMALLY SAY I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRAIL HERE AT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT GOES STRAIGHT AND DOES THE LEFT LOOKS LIKE THAT. THAT'S HOW THE TRAILS GET AGO HOW DOES THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'RE THAT'S OUR JOB YOUR RESEARCH YOU WATCH DOGS SURE AND AND THERE'S THEY ARE RELATED. THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT WOULD LOOK AT THE OWNERSHIP THE RIGHTS OF WAY THE EASEMENTS INVOLVED OF THE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PARCELS THAT ARE NORTH OF WILLITS. AND THEN THE VIABILITY OF TURNING IT INTO A TRAIL WITH THEN LOOK AT THE THE ABILITY FOR IT TO BE A VIABLE -- TRAIL PRIORITIES -- ALSO THE CONDITION OF THAT CORRIDOR IN TURNING IT INTO A TRAIL BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME PLACES WHERE. THE CONDITION IS. LESS THAN OPTIMAL. YEAH I I GUESS I ASSUME THAT SINCE THE REAL ROADS THERE YOU ALREADY HAVE THE THE EASEMENT OVER WHOEVER'S PROPERTY IT WILL IT BE THAT DIDN'T JUST GO AWAY SO THAT HALF MILLION DOLLARS. WORK MIND I I WANTED CROSS ALL THE TEASE SO. IS IT IS IT THIS. I MEAN YOU'RE ON THE TRAIL I GUESS PEOPLE WANNA GET OFF THE TRAIL SO THERE'S AT THIS THAT CLARIFICATION OF WE'RE YOU CAN STAY ON THE TRAIL BECAUSE THE EASEMENT IS ONLY ON THE THE RAIL LINE. AND THEN THIS IS PUBLIC PROPERTY OR THIS IS THIS. THE SNACK SHOP OR WHATEVER WHATEVER PEOPLE WANT TO DO WITH THIS THING -- YEAH OKAY WE'RE GONNA COME YES IT. QUESTION IN LINE WITH THAT SURE MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU -- KIT IS ACTUALLY BIKE TRAIL WAS ONE OF THE NOTES THAT I MADE -- IT AND THE CHAIR MENTION EASEMENT SO. DOES THE REAL. THIRTEEN OUR THEIR PERCEPTIONS IS JUST AN EASEMENT OR DOES THE REAL THIRTY OWN ALL OF THE LAND THAT THE RAIL IS CURRENTLY ON I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ON TO LOOK INTO AS PART OF THESE ASSESSMENTS. ON THE EVE SO SOME OF IT MIGHT BE AN EASEMENT ON PRICE ON PRIVATE OR OTHER. TYPES OF LAND. WE'RE GOING TO THAT'S PART OF OF OUR ASSESSMENT IS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT OF MR YOU KNOW PART OF THE CHALLENGE OR IF IT IS IN THESE MINUTES LEGAL EASEMENT MIGHT BE RESTRICTED TO RAIL USE. YOU KNOW WE MAY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL LAND OWNERS. TO BURKE TO CONVERT TO BY WHICH I WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT CONVERTING IT TO A BIKE TRAIL BUT NO I DID THAT WOULD BE THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PART OF THE REQUEST IT'S THE OTHER. TWO HUNDRED TWO POINT FIVE MILLION THAT DEALS WITH THE THAT WHETHER IT CAN BE A TRAIL ON WITH THAT RAILROAD WOULD DO BECAUSE BUT PEOPLE HAVE THAT AND I'M SORRY ONE MORE QUESTION YES YOU MENTIONED RAIL BANKING SO IS THERE A IS THERE A THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT. AT SOME POINT TIME BE PUT BACK INTO USE SO WHY NOT. THIS IS ALL THAT CAN. BUT THE THE BILL DOES REQUIRE US TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR RAIL BANKING SYSTEM WAS THAT WE'D LIKE TO LOOK AT TWO X.. YOUR MY THOUGHTS WAS AS PART OF THE AND MAYBE YOU'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THIS JUST CONVERT. TRANSFERRED TO STATE PARKS. ARE COUNTY PARKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF A VICTIM SO THAT'S THANK. YOU HAVE A COMMENT. I'M WE WE DID NOT RAISE ANY CONCERNS THAT WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND THE THE SITUATION ALONG THE NORTH COAST A REAL. I'M CORRIDOR AS AS THE NUMBER YOU ARE YOUR NOSE IS THIS IS BILL AND IS IS ACTUALLY FOR FOR REALLY COMPLICATED AND SO ON THAT THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE STUDY DID SEEM CONSISTENT -- WITH THE LEGISLATION THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS. ADD TO YOUR QUESTION REGARDING THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT VERSES I'M LOOKING AT THE VIABILITY OF THE TRAIL. AND THAT THERE THERE ARE -- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE SAM AND IT LIKE I'M INDIVIDUAL AGREEMENTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE NORTH COAST RAIL AUTHORITY AND PROPERTY OWNERS. AND AND GIVEN SORT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE NORTH COAST RAIL AUTHORITY IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY THEY'VE ENTERED INTO AND SO IT WENT IF WITH THE INTENT TO BEING TO ESSENTIALLY DISSOLVE THAT. WHAT'S A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND CREATE SOMETHING NEW UNDERSTANDING THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT WHAT THEY'D ENTERED INTO IS IMPORTANT. SO THAT'S THE ONE PIECE OF IT THE VIABILITY OF THE TRAIL AND THIS IS A VERY LONG CORRIDOR AND IN SOME CASES -- THERE'S BRIDGES SPANNING RIVERS AND AND SOME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED FOR RAIL AND IS AND POTENTIALLY IN A STATE OF DISREPAIR. THE OTHER ISSUE IF IT'S COST SEEN -- PRIVATE PROPERTY ON YOUR PRIVATE PROPERTY AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAY HIKING ON A MULTI DAY HIKE YOU WOULD NEED FACILITIES AND THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES YOU NEED MAYBE CAMPING FACILITIES BATHROOMS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND SO THOSE ARE SORT OF THE TWO DISTINCTIONS ONE IS ALMOST MORE OF LIKE AN OSCAR PROCESS OF UNDERSTANDING THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS ON THE PROPERTY AND THE OTHER ONE IS. ON THE BUILD OUT OF THE TRAIL COULD BE YOU KNOW COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE IT CAN BE IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS YOU MAY HAVE TO BUILD BRIDGES AND OTHER FACILITIES AND THAT PROCESS PRIVATE AGREEMENT SINCE THE RAILROAD HAS NOT BEEN OPERATING MAY HAVE LAPS UNDER TWO CONDITIONS. THAT THEY WERE ENTERED INTO A HUGE IT YES BE CONTINUE ISSUES HE ADDED THAT ANY OTHER. CENTER MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR AS WELL AS A VICE CHAIR FOR SO I JUST WANT TO I TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU. TO THE GOVERNOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TRANSPORTATION AGENCY I CALTRANS BEEN DIRECTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH.

IS NINETEEN HUNDRED APPROXIMATE PARCELS FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY ALL THE WAY UP TO EUREKA AS A WE ESTIMATE. THAT IS GONNA HAVE TO BE A BOUNDARY SURVEY OF THE ENTIRE RIGHT AWAY. I IN C. R. A. OWNS THE ENTIRE RIGHT AWAY. IN SPECIFIC FEET ON EACH SIDE SO IT IS ACTUALLY -- UNDER PUBLIC OWNERSHIP NOW. WHAT THIS IS GOING TO FIND IS NUMBER? ONE TO DO THAT BOUNDARY SURVEY WHICH WE NEED TO BE A COMPLETE AND CANDIDLY IT'S GOING TO BE A PAIN IN THE **** BECAUSE THIS RARE ROAD IS BEEN OPERATING FOR ABOUT A HUNDRED YEARS. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FOLKS OF SNUCK UP ON TO THE RIGHT AWAY -- OVER THE YEARS AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE TO SORT THROUGH THAT -- NUMBER -- TWO WE'RE GONNA WIND DOWN IN CRLA AND THAT PROCESS IS ALREADY STARTED THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY.

THIRTEEN TRANSPORTATION JUST SYSTEM OVERSIGHT. AND CITY SEE. GOOD MORNING -- DIRECTOR -- BRANSON GOOD TO SEE YOU. MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HERE TODAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MET AND SENATORS. CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. OKAY THANK YOU. AS SENATORS WITH THE WITH THE PASTOR SENATE BILL ONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE. INCREASE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING BY MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. SB ONE HAS HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE WORKLOAD OF THE COMMISSION. IT IS A SIGN RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMMISSION FOR MORE THAN FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. FOR A EXISTING AND NEWLY CREATED PROGRAMS. IT IS ALSO INCREASE THE COMMISSION'S OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HOLDING CALTRANS AND LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE EFFICIENT INVESTMENT OF PUBLIC FUNDS. THE COMMISSION UNDERSTANDS RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS INTERESTED IN. WITH RESPECT TO SENATE BILL ONE AND HAS WORKED HARD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. TO ADOPT GUIDELINES FOR SENATE BILL ONE PROGRAMS COMMIT FUNDS TO PROJECTS. IN ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE COMMISSION HAS PERFORMED THIS WORK THROUGH VERY OPEN AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. IS HELD OVER FORTY PUBLIC WORKSHOPS IN ADDITION TO HIS REGULAR BUSINESS MEETINGS TO DEVELOP AS HE WON PROGRAM GUIDELINES. THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE DEDICATION OF MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. TO STAY OUT OF STATE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING THROUGHOUT COLLEGE FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THE COMMISSION ALSO ADOPTED SENATE BILL ONE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES WHICH DETAILS SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD CALTRANS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNT OF ACCOUNTABLE. FOR DELIVERING PROJECTS AS PROMISED INCLUDING EXTENSIVE PROGRAM MONITORING AND REPORTING. THE COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY COMPLETING ITS WORKLOAD. THROUGH EVERY DIRECTION OF RESOURCES RETIRED IN NEW TENS STING ASSISTANCE AN INCREASE LEVELS OF OVERTIME AMONG STAFF. THE COMMISSION IS REQUESTING AN INCREASE IN HIS BUDGET AUTHORITY. FOR THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS IN A LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. AS WELL AS THE REALLOCATION OF FUNDING SOURCES WITHIN ITS ITS EXISTING BUDGET AUTHORITY. THESE REQUESTED POSITIONS WERE ADDRESS INCREASED WORKLOAD IN SEVEN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND ONE POSITION WILL ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION SUSTAINABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AND OTHER RELATED ISSUES. THE CROSS CUT ALL OF THE COMMISSION'S PROGRAMS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION I'M HERE TODAY TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR APPROVAL OF THIS REQUEST. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS OF THIS ITEM NUMBER THREE THIS IS THE OVERSIGHT [inaudible] THE THREE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND A TWO YEAR LIMIT TERM POSITIONS ALEJO. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIFIC PROPOSAL BUT JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT AND AS DIRECTOR BRAD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BRANSON SAID THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN WORKLOAD BOTH IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AT CTC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING. AS WELL AS A GREATER LEVEL OF PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT THAT THE COMMISSION IS DOING ON ON BOTH THE NEW SB ONE MONIES AS WELL AS ALL OTHER PROJECTS. THAT GREATER LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT WAS SOMETHING THAT OUR OFFICE HAD RECOMMENDED FOR ON A LONG TIME AND WAS INCLUDED IN THAT SB ONE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. PACKAGE AT THE TIME WE HAD RECOMMENDED THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASE IN STAFF ON TO THE COMMISSION SINCE OUR STAFF IS RELATIVELY SMALL. AND THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES SIMON -- PERMANENT AND SOME LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THIS WORKLOAD IS GONNA BE ON GOING AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REVISIT THOSE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS IN THE FUTURE. BUT THE REASON THEY'RE PROPOSED AS LIMITED TERM IS THERE'S A CURRENT REVIEW GOING ON BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE CTC TO DETERMINE EXACTLY THE MAKE UP -- SO THEY'RE IN THE WORKLOAD IS NOT LIMITED TERM IT IS I'M GOING I WOULD GUESS THAT THE CHAIR IS INTERESTED IN THAT. CLIMATE ADAPTATION POSTUM WHETHER THERE WOULD BE A NEED TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE PERSON WORK ON THAT IN THE FUTURE AFTER THEY THEY GET IN THERE MEMBERS QUESTIONS ON THIS MATTER THE REQUEST [inaudible] CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BRANSON -- WE'RE VERY EXCITED I WOULD SAY AT LEAST -- IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS CO AT MORE ACTIVE ROLE FOR THE CDC AND BUT WAS WAS SORT OF A STRATEGIC ARM IS NOW BECOMING REALLY TAKEN STRATEGY IN TRYING TO BECOME OF OF FUNDING A REAL. LONG TERM SORT OF FUNDING ENTITIES RIGHT I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT -- THERE'S A LOT OF KNOW HOW BUILT IN THERE I'M WONDERING THOUGH HOW YOU. HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR STRATEGY AS OF RIGHT NOW? BOTH ON A SORT OF ON ON A REGIONAL BASIS WITH. WHAT WHAT OUTCOMES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING THIS THIS POT? YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION OF IT'S INTERESTING SENATE BILL ONE IS IT DID HAVE A CALL FOR THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP AND ADOPT. CONGESTED MULTI MODAL CONGESTED A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI MODE LOOK AT CORD OR PLANTS. IT'S TO THE COMMISSION HAS NOW ADOPTED GUIDELINES OVER THIS LAST YEAR IN CONSULTATION WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. ON WITH THOSE PLANS WOULD LOOK LIKE HOW THEY SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. THE LONG TERM VISION WOULD BE THOSE PLANS ARE IN PROCESS RIGHT NOW AMONG THE REGIONAL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THEIR MULTI MODAL PLANS THAT WOULDN'T ENCOMPASS NOT ONLY HIGHWAYS BUT TRANSIT RAIL ACTED TRANSPORTATION. ADDRESSING THE OVERALL STATE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE HAVE. BEEN SO IN THE LONG RUN WHAT I SEE IN THE COMMISSION IN CONSULTATION WITH THEM. IS IT THOSE PLANS ARE VERY IMPORTANT THERE LOCALLY AND REGIONALLY DEVELOPED. THROUGH A PUBLIC PROCESS WITH PRIORITIES FOR INVESTMENT. AND THEY SHOULD ONLINE WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION PLAN. AND SO IDEALLY NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE ON GOING SUSTAINABLE FUNDING THANKFULLY. TO THE THE DIFFICULT WORK THAT YOU ALL DID HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. NOW WE HAVE CERTAINTY IN FUNDING OVER THE NEXT DECADE WE CAN WORK TOWARDS IMPLEMENTING THOSE THOSE MULTI MODAL CHORD OR PLANS. BECAUSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE NOT EVERY PROJECTS READY TO GO TODAY. SO IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN LINE UP FUNDING STRATEGICALLY TO MOVE THOSE PLANS FOR THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO THAT WOULD BE THE VISION. WITH THE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE TODAY -- WE DO NEED -- WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US IN THAT REGARD WE ARE A VERY SMALL STAFF. AND WE'RE FINDING THAT WITH THIS NEW -- INCREASE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THIS RIGHT WE NEED TO ALLOW OUR MANAGERS THE TIME TO STE TO SET THAT STRATEGY. AND IMPLEMENT THAT STRATEGY AND THEY'RE NOT NO LONGER ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS PRIDE OURSELVES UNLESS STAFF BUT THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO CARRY. ALL THE WORKLOAD AND STILL STEP BACK AND CONSIDER WHAT IS THAT STRATEGY WORKING WITH OUR REGIONAL PARTNERS. SO DID YOU DO DO YOU CONCUR DO YOU SEE THE A POTENTIAL -- BOTTLE NECK IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF RESPONSIBILITY IN LEVEL CAPACITY. YES SIR SO AND THAT THE THE COMMISSION IS DOING WE KNOW PRIMARY THEIR PRIMARY ROLE THEY'RE SETTING PROGRAM GUIDELINES ARE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS OR SOMETIMES SELECTING PROJECTS FOR COMPETITIVE PROGRAMS. AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING FUNDING SO WHEN YOU APPROPRIATE MONEY FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS YOU'RE APPROPRIATING A BIG LUMP SUM. AND THEN **** PROJECTS BECOME READY FOR AND THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION THE PROJECT SPONSOR OFTENTIMES ON CALTRANS SOMETIMES A A LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY WILL GO TO THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION SAY HERE'S OUR PROJECT. HERE'S THE STATE ROUTE WE NEED THIS MUCH MONEY FOR DESIGNER THIS MUCH MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION AND THE COMMISSION AND STAFF. IS EVALUATING EACH OF THOSE PROJECTS SO IN ADDITION TO SETTING OVERALL STRATEGY IN THE PROGRAM THEY'RE ALSO DOING THIS PROJECT LEVEL WORK. SB WHEN INCREASED ON THE% COMMISSION'S RESPONSIBILITY SORT OF ON ALL FRONTS THERE'S NEW PROGRAMS FOR THEM TO MINISTER AND ABOUT GUIDELINES FOR THERE'S NEW RULES LIKE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED. AND THAT PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT PIECE HAS ALSO INCREASED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT AND SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE GOING TO REQUIRE MORE STAFF THEY HAVE YOU KNOW ANYWHERE BETWEEN LIKE FIFTEEN AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE TO DO ALL OF THAT. AND SO IT'S A VERY SMALL STAFF AND REALLY THERE TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OF YOU KNOW FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ARE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING EVERY YEAR YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE THAT INCREASED. WHAT'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE HIS. AS BUDGET THIS IS ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM OVERSIGHT. THING NOBODY THERE WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT IN. ENERGY MOTION. THERE'S MUCH BY CENTER STERN PLEASE CALL ROLL. CASKEY BY JONES. WHO ARE? MONNING. STERN. RIGHT THAT HAS FIVE VOTERS APPROVED FIVE ZERO NOW ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN IS THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION -- PROGRAM AT ANTICIPATE SOME ACTIVITY ON ATP WE DID GET A NICE SENATE REPORT HERE THAT I'D GIVE ME SOME CHEAT -- CHEAT SHEETS ON WHAT I SHOULD BE ASKING WHAT THE COMMISSION SHOULD BE DOING ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT PLEASE LET'S HAVE YOUR PRESENTATION. LET'S START WITH THE LA L.. THANK YOU AND SO THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM ON YOUR AGENDA AND OUR OFFICE WAS ASKED -- TO AS PART OF THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET PACKAGE TO DO AB REVIEW EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND IN ADDITION THAT SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS ALSO DONE A REVIEW -- LOOKING SOMEONE AT DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND SO I'LL PRESENT FIRST ARSES SORT OF MORE OF THE OVER ARCHING. AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE PROGRAM IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS SENSE AND IT'S BEEN CREATED. AND AND THEN MISTER LIKE OBERSTAR'S PRESENTATION IS MORE FOCUSED ON SOME SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. HI I'M CALLING. THIS IS OURS CORRECT YES YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A SUMMARY OF TWO DIFFERENT REPORTS TODAY SO. AND AND I THINK THE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU IS THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN OUR FINDINGS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WHAT THE SENATE UP OFFICE OF RESEARCH HAS FOUND. AND THEY WERE IN ANSWERING SOME WE WERE TASKED WITH DIFFERENT QUESTIONS -- AND SO IN SOME CASES WE'VE COME UP WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT BUT I THINK EVERYBODY'S AT LEAST ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT. I'M SORT OF THE STATUS OF THINGS. THAT CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I'LL JUST DO AS HE ARE OF THE SENATE THE RESEARCH OFFICE IS RIGHT THERE AT DAIS. SO I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE PROGRAM SO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WAS CREATED AS PART OF THAT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN BUDGET PACKAGE. AND AND REALLY WHAT THIS DID WAS TAKE SEVERAL SMALLER I'M PROGRAMS SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS A BICYCLE TRANSPORTATION ACCOUNTS AND PEDESTRIAN ACCOUNTS. AND COMBINED ALL OF THESE FUNDS TOGETHER AS WITH SOME FEDERAL FINES I'M TO CREATE ONE LARGER PROGRAM WHICH REALLY THE GOALS BEING TO PUT MORE FOCUS ON ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. OFTENTIMES THE PROJECTS FUNDED FROM THESE ACCOUNTS WERE SORT OF LANGUISHING IN NOT BEING DONE IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER IS MAYBE THEY WERE AT THE HIGHEST PRIORITY IS SOME OF THE LARGER PROJECTS. TO PUT THAT FOCUS ON AS WELL AS GIVING THE STATE SAM -- ROLE IN SETTING PRIORITIES ARE EVEN SELECTING PROJECTS FOR TRANSPORTATION THESE ARE TEND TO BE VERY SMALL PROJECTS AND WERE TYPICALLY THOUGHT OF AS SORT OF LOCAL PROJECTS AND WERE GENERALLY SELECTED THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO. GIVING THE STATE SOME ROLE IN IN SELECTING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. I AM SO IN THE ATP WAS CREATED IN THESE FUNDS WERE CONSOLIDATED THERE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. SB ONE ADDED ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION TOHAVE ABOUT A TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM AT THIS TIME. I'M UNDER THE WAY THE PROGRAM WAS STRUCTURED THERE'S BASICALLY THREE POTS OF MONEY AND THERE'S A 50% POT WHICH IS THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM THOSE PROJECTS ARE SELECTED BY THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THERE'S A 40% PART OF MONEY. I THERE'S A 40% PART OF MONEY I'M FOR THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS ARE NPOS AND THEN 10% OF THE FUNDING IS FOR PROJECTS IN THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL REGIONS OF THE STATE. SO THAT'S THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED SO IN OUR REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM AND WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED WHAT OUTCOMES IN BENEFITS HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED. SO IM IN TERMS OF PROJECTS THERE HAVE BEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX PROJECTS TO DATE PROGRAMMED INTO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND IT SEVENTY FIVE ABOUT 75% OF THOSE ARE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS SO THIS COULD BE BUILDING A BIKE LANE IMPROVING A SIDEWALK INSTALLING IT I'D TRAFFIC CROSSING PEDESTRIAN CROSSING SIGNAL THOSE TYPES OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. I'M AND THE REMAINDER OF THE PROJECTS TEND TO BE -- PLANNING WORK AS WELL AS FINDING THAT WITH THE STATE'S ON ACTIVE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER WITHIN CALTRANS -- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED ACROSS THE DIFFERENT -- COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM THE STATEWIDE MPO AND THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL. AND THE TYPES OF PROJECTS BEING FUNDED IN THESE DIFFERENT POTS ARE ARE PRETTY SIMILAR AND WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS THE SAME SORT OF DOLLAR AMOUNT DOLLAR VALUE OF PROJECTS. ON AND SO THERE IS NOTHING THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT TO US FIVE SAYING WELL THIS COMPONENT THE PROGRAM TENDS TO BE FINDING CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS OR MEETING CERTAIN GOALS. AND THIS PROGRAMS READING SOMETHING DIFFERENT SO IT'S VERY SIMILAR. I'M ANOTHER THING THAT WE WOULD KNOW IS THAT SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECTS ARE ALL THESE TEND TO BE VERY SMALL DOLLAR VALUE PROJECTS THEM IMPROVING A SIDEWALK OR PUTTING IN A BIKE LANE IS. A MUCH SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNT THAN SOME OF OUR LARGER TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. BUT OVER TIME WE ARE SEEING THAT THESE PROJECTS HAVE GOTTEN SOMEWHAT BIGGER IN TERMS OF THE DOLLAR VALUE. I'M AND IT THAT THAT WOULD ALL BE EXPLAINED JUST BY SORT OF RISING CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT AS THE PROGRAM IS IS BECOMING MORE ESTABLISH THAT. PROJECT SPONSORS ARE MOVING I'M MORE AND MORE TOWARDS A LARGER PROJECT ONE OF THE GOALS WHEN THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED. AND WISE OR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW FOR WOULD BE REALLY THESE LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE TYPES OF PROJECTS WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING ENOUGH OF A INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGE OR IMPROVEMENT. TO REALLY ALLOW TRAVELS TRAVELERS TO HAVE A MOOD SHIFT -- SO THAT THEY COULD TAKE SOME TRIPS NOT BY DRIVING BUT INSTEAD BY WALKING OR BIKING AND YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH OF A SORT OF A NETWORK OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MANY CASES FOR THAT TO ACTUALLY. I'M BE WORKABLE FOR PEOPLE. AND SO IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE PROGRAM COULD BE MOVING TOWARD SOME OF THOSE LARGER PROJECTS. AND THE OTHER THING WE'RE ASKED TO LOOK AT IS AND BENEFITS OF THE PROJECTS ARE OUTCOMES OF THE PROGRAM HOW EFFECTIVE IS A AT THAT MEETING AT SCHOOLS. AND I'M WITH THE PRIMARY GOAL THAT WE WOULD YOU KNOW CARE ABOUT IS IS IT INCREASING WALKING AND BIKING THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PROGRAM I'M NOT WHAT. I TOLD POINT BY IN THE MAIN LINE I'M AND WE DON'T KNOW -- THERE AT THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED RIGHT NOW IS REALLY INSUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO TELL US WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE AT THE PROGRAM IN THAT REGARD. AND I WILL CARRY OUT THAT ALSO WAS SAYING THAT I'M JUST GIVEN THE TIMING AND THE RELATIVE NEWNESS OF THIS PROGRAM IT'S BEEN IN EFFECT FOR FIVE YEARS BUT BECAUSE IT TAKES MANY YEARS FOR PROJECT TO BE DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED AND COMPLETED -- THERE HAVE ONLY JUST IN THIS PAST YEAR BEEN THE FIRST ROUND OF SORT OF PROJECT COMPLETION REPORTS THAT HAD BECOME AVAILABLE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A SOMEWHAT LIMITED DATA SAID AND THIS IS A REALLY GOOD. TIME LINE FOR YOU ALL TO BE LOOKING AT IF THERE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKS ARE CHANGES TO THE WAY INFORMATION IS REPORTED BECAUSE IT'S STILL RELATIVELY NEW SO THERE WERE ABOUT. SIXTY FIVE PROJECTS THAT HAVE REPORTED OUT AT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THAT ARE COMPLETED AND I'VE COME TO THE REPORTERS THAT REPORTING. PART OF THAT THE PROGRAM. I'M IS SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T KNOW IF THE PROGRAM IS MAKING MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS AND WALKING AND BIKING. AND EVEN IF YOU HAD THE YOU KNOW ON THE STREETS THEY PUT DOWN THOSE -- WIRES OR CORDS THE U. CARS GO OVER IN A COUNT HOW MANY IT IS THE PET PEDESTRIANS WOULD JUST WALK OVER THAT THERE WOULD BE LIKE A OKAY WALK OVER THIS I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S THERE. JUST GO AHEAD YEAH AND SAYS YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR US RIGHT. WE DO AND IF IF I COULD JUST BRIEFLY FINISH THERE THAT THE FINDING SO WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO LOOK AT WHETHER ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM IS ARE PROJECTS BENEFITING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES A MINIMUM OF 25% OF THE FANS HAVE TO BENEFIT. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THE PROGRAM DOES APPEAR TO BE MEETING THATGOAL AND 88% OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE EITHER IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY OR WERE OUTSIDE A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY THAT HAD A BENEFIT. TO A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY BUT LIKEWISE. IT MAY HAVE BEEN BUILT A DISPENSED MANY BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY'S GETTING ON THEIR BIKE OR THEY'RE WALKING AFTER IT'S BEEN BUILT BECAUSE THE DATA IS. PRESSING OKAY GOT IT. AND THAT WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK WHETHER THERE'S BENEFITS TO THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM THERE'S NO ON THESE TEND TO BE LOCAL PROJECTS SO THERE'S NO SPECIFIC CARVE OUT FOR BENEFITING THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. I'M AND THERE'S OTHER GOALS OF THE PROGRAM HAS I'M GHG REDUCTIONS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS THOSE TEND TO SORT OF BE TIED TO IF YOU'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN WALKING AND BIKING. I'M MORE YOU'E SEEING THA MODE SHIFT AND SO AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TELL THOSE ESPECIALLY WITHOUT ANY ACCURATE DATA ON ON THE WALKING AND BIKING. AND IF WE WERE ALSO ASKED TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATION IT CHALLENGES AND AND AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON IMPROVING THE PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES AND ONE OF THE THINGS THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS SET UP AT LEAST IN THIS LAST SPENDING CYCLE IS WHY YOU HAVE THESE FOUR POTS OF MONEY. AND YOU HAVE A AND P. O. COULD CHOOSE AND PRIORITIZE OUR OWN PROJECT WITHIN THEIR PART OF MANY. THEY ARE LIMITED TO THE PROJECTS THAT OUR FIRST COMPETED IN THE STATEWIDE COMPETITION. AND THEN THE PROJECTS THAT DON'T GET FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE WIDE PORTION OF THE PROGRAM. GET SENT DOWN BASICALLY TO THE I'M PL IS FOR THEM TO CHOOSE AND SO BECAUSE THERE IS AND IN SOME PROJECT SPONSORS ARE HIRING CONSULTANTS TO HELP THEM GET THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. IT CAN BE I AND I IN OTHER SOME WORKLOAD THAT GOES ALONG WITH APPLYING GO INTO THAT. CTC PROCESS EVIDENTLY IT'S A DIFFICULT APPLICATION PROCESS TO GET THROUGH. OUR YEAH I THINK WE HAVE. YEAH WE HAD HEARD THAT FROM A FROM SOME OF THE PROJECT SPONSORS THAT WE TALKED TO I THINK THE CDC HAS TRIED TO RESPOND BY CREATING. MORE STREAMLINED VERSIONS OF APPLICATIONS FOR SMALLER PROJECTS BUT THERE IS STILL DEFINITELY LIKE AN ADMINISTRATIVE WORKLOAD THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH. AND SO THAT COULD SORT OF SCARE OFF SOME PROJECT SPONSORS MAYBE OR IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT TO THEM TO APPLY TO YOU COULD BE HAVING A SITUATION WHERE. THE NPOS ARE BEING SORT OF ARTIFICIALLY LIMITED AND NOT ABLE TO PICK THE PROJECTS THAT ARE THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY BECAUSE THEY'RE LIMITED TO THE PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE STATEWIDE COMPETITION. SO IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE OBVIOUS ONE IS MAKE SURE WE'RE COLLECTING THE DATA -- YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROGRAM IS INCREASING WALKING AND BIKING TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM I'M GOING FORWARD. ONE OF THE THINGS TO BE MINDFUL OF IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WALKING AND BIKING INCREASE YOU HAVE TO DO SORT OF COUNTS GO OUT BEFORE THE PROJECT AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WALKING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BIKING AND LIKE YOU SAID MISTER CHAIR YOU CAN'T JUST BUT WHEN. OTHER STRIPS DOWN INTO ACCOUNT SO THERE'S OTHER METHODOLOGIES FOR DOING IT -- BUT THAT CAN BE EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL PROJECT TO MAKE VERY SMALL IMPROVEMENTS. YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHICH PROJECTS DOES IT MAKE THE MOST SENSE SIGN MAYBE IT'S THE BIGGER PROJECTS MAYBE AT CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS. I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT JOB DOESN'T IT FOR THE SUMMER TO SIT THERE WITH THE TICKER KICKING QUE QUE COUNT ON THEN YOUR FINAL THOUGH AND THEN. THE LAST TWO RECOMMENDATIONS SO. CONSIDER WHAT THE ROLE OF THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM IS SO WHEN WHEN THIS IS CREATED THE IDEA IS TO PROVIDE MORE HIGHLIGHT MORE IMPORTANT SIGN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. AND GIVE THE STATE A ROLE IN SETTING PRIORITIES AND SELECTING PROJECTS. AND THESE TEND OTHERWISE WOULD BE VERY LOCAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE DETERMINE WHAT THE PRIORITY IS AT A LOCAL OR REGIONAL LEVEL. AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE STATE MAKING THAT THAT PRIORITY SETTING ARE PROJECTS SELECTION THE SETTING AND HAVING NOT ROLL THINKING ABOUT WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE SELECTED AT THE STATE LEVEL. SO WHEN WE LOOKED AT A HER THOUGHT IS HAVING THESE LARGER MORE TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS WHERE YOU MAY BE REALLY BUILDING OUT A NETWORK OF BIKE LANES OR MAKING ENOUGH IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU WOULD SEE AS SIGNIFICANT MODE SHIFT. THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND WE TEND TO BE A REALLY GOOD FIT FOR THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT. OF THE PROGRAM AND IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE A LOCAL COMMUNITY MAYBE A CITY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PULL TOGETHER ENOUGH FUNDING TO DO THAT TYPE OF A PROJECT ON THEIR OWN AND SO IT IT MAKES SENSE THAT THE STATE WOULD COME IN AND HAVE A PROGRAM FOR DOING THOSE. TYPES OF PROJECTS I'M YOU MAY HAVE OTHER GOALS THAT YOU WANT THAT -- COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE -- YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE HAVING THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ACHIEVE DIFFERENT GOALS HAVING THREE COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM. WITH AND DIFFERENT GROUPS SELECTING THE PROJECTS BUT THEY'RE ALL KIND OF MEETING THE SAME GOALS AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO SEX SELECT THE SAME PROJECTS. GOING TO BEG THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO YOU GETTING OUT OF THE STATE HAVING THIS OVERALL ROLE IN IT IF WE'RE JUST PICKING. MUCH OF THE SAME TYPES OF PROJECTS WE WOULD PICK ANYWAYS IF YOU JUST YOU KNOW LET THAT THE REGION'S AND LOCAL AGENCIES SELECT THE PROJECTS. AND AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT. I'M IN A SETTING DIFFERENT GOALS RE FRAMING THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT AND AS YOU DO THAT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO ALSO NEED TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF HOW THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED. I'M RIGHT NOW HAVING EVERYTHING FLOW THROUGH CTC WITH THE WAY THE PROGRAM SET UP KIND OF MAKES SENSE -- BUT IF YOU'RE CHANGING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY HAVE TO APPLY FOR IT THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM FIRST. IF THERE REALLY IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROJECT A REGION YEAH THE THE EIGHTY SO IF YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO THINK THROUGH THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE PROGRAM AS YOU THINK THROUGH THAT. YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT THE STATE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS. SO THAT THE THE LOCAL PEOPLE GET TO HAVE THE MONEY IN WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE AT THE OLD THE REGIONAL LEVEL YEAH SO THAT'S OUR LAST RECOMMENDATION IS CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE FLEXIBILITY IS TO THE M. PO'S. SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LIMITED TO THIS POOL OF PROJECTS IT DIDN'T GET FUNDED THROUGH THE STATE RIGHT COMPETITION SO WE THINK AT A MINIMUM MAYBE LIKE OPEN THAT UP ON AND PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE SO THAT. THERE'S NOT PROJECTS THAT MIGHT BE A HIGH LOCAL PRIORITY THE END UP GETTING EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM. I'M AND YOU COULD MAKE A CHANGE AS SIMPLE AS THAT WERE YOU COULD DO MORE WERE YOU INSTEAD OF HAVING AND RIGHT NOW WE TALKED IN THE LAST SAME ABOUT SORT OF PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT IN THE C. T. C. ALLOCATING FUNDING BY PHASE OF A PROJECT -- THERE DOING THAT FOR ALL OF THESE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS -- YOU COULD MOVE AWAY FROM THAT AND YOU COULD MOVE TO MORE OF YOU KNOW SORT OF A BLOCK GRANT TYPE APPROACH AND HAVE AND OTHER TYPES OF REPORTING THAT YOU HAVE THE NPOS REPORT BACK OR EVEN THE SMALLER REGIONS REPORT BACK TO THE STATE ON HOW THE FUNDS WERE. SPENT BUT WE DO THINK GIVING THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY AND AND AT LEAST SOME WAY IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO CONSIDER AND AGAIN AS YOU THINK ABOUT CHANGING THAT THE REGIONAL POT OF MONEY IN THE STATE PART OF MANY AGAIN THAT'S GOING TO HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW THE PROGRAM. IS JUST. TURN OVER ALL. THANK YOU I'M SURE MY MEMBERS WILL HAVE QUESTIONS NOW WE HAVE -- KID LINK OVER SIR FROM THE SENATE OFFICE RESEARCH WELCOME MR LINK OVER STAR THANK YOU MISTER ENTER THE REPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME HERE TO DISCUSS -- OF THE PROJECT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE THAT WE MADE FOR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION -- JUST BUT YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- HOW THIS PROJECT CAME ABOUT AT THE REQUEST F YOUR STAFF WE WERE ASKED TO LOOK? SPECIFICALLY AT THE THE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE BUT SPECIFICALLY ADDS THE PROJECT SELECTION AND ALLOCATION OF FUNDING AND AND HOW THAT'S WORKING AND WHETHER THAT COULD BE -- IMPROVED AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SUGGESTIONS I KEEPING RECOMMENDATIONS BUT OUR SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION -- FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON ON THAT AREA -- IN CONDUCTING THIS -- WE INTERVIEWED STAFF FROM BOTH THE COMMISSION AND FROM CALTRANS AS WELL AS ABOUT A DOZEN STAKEHOLDERS OR MORE. REPRESENTATIVE OF OF DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT ENTITIES SOME OF THE MPO THE SOME OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WHO APPLIED FOR FUNDING -- ADVOCACY GROUPS TO SUPPORT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AND SOCIAL EQUITY -- IN ORDER TO TRY AND GET THEIR INPUT ON WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED -- IN ADDITION WE LOOKED AT THE THE DATA THE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA ON THE PROJECTS SUBMITTED IN THOSE SELECTED THE THAT THE COMMISSION PUBLISHES -- AND I ALSO INDEPENDENT THIS PROJECT IN PRIOR THIS PROJECT HAD SERVED AS A PHONE TWO REVIEWER -- FOR FOR THIS PROGRAM LOOKING AT PROJECTS -- DURING THE THIRD AND THE FOURTH CYCLES -- BECAUSE I WANTED TO GET MORE -- UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE PROGRAM WAS WORKING SO I WAS. BASING AYE. AYE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THAT INFORMATION AS WELL ANOTHER SENATE EMPLOYEE WITH HANDS ON KNOWLEDGE STILL VERY GOOD -- ARE KEY FINDINGS -- NUMBER ONE THE PROGRAM IS EXTREMELY POPULAR IT'S VERY MUCH OVERSUBSCRIBED LOTS MORE REQUEST FOR FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE -- AND A HIGHLY ENGAGE STAKEHOLDER GROUP THERE IS A LOT OF PARTICIPATION A LOT OF UP. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE A HANDS ON IMPACT ON THE PROCESS. AMONG THE STATE BECAUSE WE TALKED TO A VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY SUPPORTS THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM NOBODY WANTED. TO BASICALLY JUST ALLOCATE THE FUNDING STRICTLY BY FORMULA AND NOT HAVE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS -- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT DOES ALLOW US TO FIND THE BEST PROJECTS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE IN THE STATE -- IT ALLOWS SMALL COMMUNITIES TO PUNCH ABOVE THEIR WEIGHT -- TO GET MORE FUNDING THAN THEY MIGHT UNDER HAVE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING ON THEIR EVEN SEVERAL YEARS OF A A FORMULA ALLOCATION -- AND SOME PEOPLE ALSO SAID THAT THE STATE WIDE. STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT OF THE PROGRAM -- REDUCES LOCAL. LOCAL POLITICS AND IN THEIR VIEW -- RESULTS IN MORE OBJECTIVE REVIEW OF OF THE PROJECT BENEFITS -- WE DID ALSO HEAR FROM A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT -- THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS VERY COSTS AND LABOR. INTENSIVE ONE OF THE MOST -- COST LABOR INTENSIVE APPLICATIONS THEY DO SEVERAL SEVERAL APPLICANTS TOLD US THAT -- IN PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT. THE CDC IS TRYING TO GATHER A LOT OF DATA -- TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PROJECTS ARE ACCOMPLISHING AS WELL AS A NARRATIVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THIS PROJECT REALLY TRYING TO DO BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. INCREASE WALKING AND BIKING IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WITHOUT A COMPELLING NARRATIVE IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR. HOW THESE PARTICULAR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE GONNA DO WHAT WE'RE WANTING THEM TO DO SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO IT -- AND BUT THAT THAT WE RECOGNIZE IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE NEED THAT FOR DOING PROJECT EVALUATION -- BUT THAT IS A CHALLENGE. SOME OF THE OUR VERTICALLY THE REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TOLD US THAT -- THE CHALLENGES THE STATEWIDE HALF OF THE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR DOESN'T. CONSIDER THEIR REGIONAL PRIORITIES EVERY -- MPO -- EVERY VETERINARIAN THE STATE HAS OUR GOALS AND PLANS THAT THEY HAVE TO INFLUENCE TO STABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES CONGESTION MEDICATION AIR QUALITY LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT. WE EXPECT THEM TO DELIVER ON BUT WHAT THEY TOLD US IS THAT THIS STATEWIDE WHICHEVER HALF MONEY THIS PROGRAM COMES FROM. DOESN'T. NECESSARILY TAKE IN THE CONSIDERATION WHICH PROJECTS ARE. ARE GOING TO HELP THE REGION'S MEET THOSE GOALS -- SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR THEM THEY THEY GET WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE THE STATEWIDE COMPETITION BUT IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT MOVES THE NEEDLE -- THERE ALSO SOME QUESTIONS RAISED ABOUT THE SELECTION PROCESS VERY COMPLEX REFLECTION PROCESS. LOTS OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE SUBMITTED -- AND TO WHETHER THAT PROCESS IS ABLE TO REALLY SELECT. THE BEST PROJECTS THE AS I SAID THE COMPANY THE PREMISE OF THE PROGRAM IS WE SHOULD BE FINDING THE BEST PROJECTS WHEREVER THEY ARE IN THE STATE -- BUT UNDER THE STATE'S SELECTION PROCESS THERE ARE. TWO REVIEWERS THAT LOOK AT EACH PARTICULAR PROJECT AND THOSE ARE HERE THEY COME FROM A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERTISE YOU MAY HAVE ENGINEERS YU MAY HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE. ADVOCATES A WIDE RANGE OF OF FOLKS BRING THEIR PERSPECTIVE -- AND THOUGH THE GROUP THE COMMISSION HAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY ROBUST RUBRIC. THERE IS STILL OBVIOUSLY A A ROOM FOR SUBJECTIVITY ANYTIME YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE COMING FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S SO COMPETITIVE THE ONE POINT. IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- IN MANY CASES BEING FUNDED OR NOT -- IF. YOU HAVE A REVIEWERTHAT LOOKS AT IT AND IS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE GENEROUS REVIEWER MAYBE COMES AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT -- EMPHASIS AND YOU DON'T HAVE. SOMEONE SORT OF BALANCING THAT OUT FROM A WIDE RANGE OF OF EXPERTISE. YOU CAN GET SOME SOME VERY ABILITY OR SAID SOMETHING IF I AM VERY ABILITY THAT WE THINK MIGHT. MIGHT IN. INFLUENCE WHY SOME PROJECTS. SCORE HIGHER THAN OTHER VERY SIMILAR PROJECTS SO -- THAT'S A CHALLENGE WITH THE WAY THAT THE PROJECT WITH THE PROCESSES. IS STRUCTURED. IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE DATA -- WE DID FIND THAT MOST AT LEAST AMONG THE 40% THAT GOES TO THE THE LARGE NPOS I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING THAT LA -- SAID -- DIRECTLY EIGHTEEN M. P. O.'S IN THE STATE THE THE 40% SHARE IS THOSE TEN NPOS. THAT -- ARE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. THERE'S EIGHT OTHER NPOS THAT ARE SMALLER. THEY ARE CAPTURED IN THE 10% OF RURAL AND SMALL URBAN COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM. THEY DO HOWEVER. HAVE. SUSTAINABILITY GOALS AND OTHER OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT THAT THE LARGE ONES TO AS WELL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER -- BUT AMONG THE LARGE POS MOST OF THE TEN OF THIS TEN SEVEN OF THEM DID RECEIVE A SHARE OF THE OVERALL STATE POT OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM. THAT'S COMMENSURATE ROUGHLY WITH THEIR SHARE OF THE POPULATION OF THERE WERE. THREE AREAS THAT HAVE HAVE UNDERPERFORMED AND I DIDN'T DIG INTO. DEPTH INTO SPECIFICALLY WHAT WHAT WHAT THEY HAVE IN THE FOR THE FACTORS THAT THAT'S A MATTER -- FOR FOR SITUATION BUT THREE OF THEM DID SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER PERFORMED -- WELL THE SMALLER MINERAL -- AND THESE HAVE AS A COLLECTIVE -- PERFORM PRETTY WELL THEY REPRESENT 8% OF POPULATION BUT ABOUT 13% OF THE PROJECT FUNDING. TO THAT'S GOOD BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT -- A LOT OF THAT FUNDING GOES TO JUST TWO OR THREE OF THE REGIONS AND A COUPLE OF THE OF THE SMALLER HER DOING VERY WELL BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO AREN'T SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND. AS WE LOOK AT HOW WELL THE PROGRAM IS IS IN IS THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE WEATHER SMALL PROJECTS IT JUST. COSTS SO MUCH MONEY ON THAT AND AND THE SMALLER PROJECTS MEAN WHEN YOU SAY IT'S 13% OF THE PIE. AND IT'S ONLY PERCENT POPULATION I SORT OF THINK IT'S IT'S OKAY BY I GUESS IT'S RURAL SO IT'S SPREAD OUT AND SURE THAT'S THE THAT'S THE EIGHT SMALLER NPOS AND ALL OF THE RULES TOGETHER I THINK IT'S ABOUT THOSE REGIONS HAVE. GOT ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE FOUR CYCLES IN -- IN STATE FUNDING IT THEY WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IF YOU DID IT BY A STRICT. POPULATION MODEL THEY WOULD HAVE. GOTTEN. THAT THAT THAT PART OF THE THOSE AND THESE COLLECTIVELY WITH ABOUT SEVENTY MILLION NOW HOW THAT GOT. DISTRIBUTED IN PARTICULAR PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW AND ARE THERE MORE. RURAL PROJECTS IN JUST IN BALK NUMBER BECAUSE YOU JUST WARY ATTEND THE URBAN AND SUBURBAN PROJECTS OR IS THAT. IS THAT'S NOT IT REALLY I HONESTLY HAVEN'T LOOKED AT OKAY WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT YOU KNOW HOW THAT BREAKS DOWN IN TERMS OF CONTINUE. AND IF YOU DO A JURISDICTIONS DID PARTICULARLY WELL -- FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY THEY'VE. GOT VERTICALLY GOOD AT AT YOU KNOW WORKING AT THIS AT THIS PROGRAM BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF REGIONS ARE BEING -- YOU KNOW THERE HAVE NOT PERFORMED ALL THAT WELL SO THAT'S JUST ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER. ANOTHER THING WHEN LOOKING AT THE DATA AND THIS WAS ALREADY REFERENCE BY -- THE LA OVER THE AVERAGE PROJECTS SIZE BOTH OF SUBMITTED PROJECT APPLICATIONS AND THOSE AWARDED HAS. GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY IN PREDICAMENT CYCLE THREE TO CYCLE FOR IT DOUBLED FROM AN AVERAGE PROJECT SIZE ABOUT TWO POINT THREE TO FOUR POINT SIX MILLION SO. A PART OF THAT IS CERTAINLY THE COMMISSION HAS. A AS A POLICY MATTER OF SAID THEY WANT TO FIND MORE TRANSFORMATIONAL PROJECTS BUT AND THAT'S THAT'S IMPORTANT. POLICY GOAL TO CONSIDER -- GIVEN THE CURRENT FUNDING IT HAS CAUSED A PRECIPITOUS DROP IN THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND AND THAT'S JUST A DURING YOUR RESEARCH WAS THAT BECAUSE LET'S SAY IT'S A SMALL PROJECT. INSTEAD OF DOING FOUR MILES OF BIKE PATHS ARE DOING FIVE MILES TO BY PASS CYLINDER SMALL. I SIZE OR IS IT BECAUSE ONE MILE OF BIKE PATH COSTS MORE MONEY THAN IT DID. FOUR YEARS AGO. WHERE DID I GET NOW INTO THAT LEVEL OF GRANULARITY BUT I WOULD SAY OVER TO A TWO YEARS OF SUCH CYCLE TO SEE? THE A DOUBLING OF THE PROJECT SIZE IS PROBABLY CAN'T BE. ACCOUNTED FOR BY SIMPLY -- THAT BUT MAYBE MAYBE THE COMMISSION HAS DONE MORE. DIGGING INTO THIS WE GET TO THAT LATER. I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETELY EXPLAINED BY JUST INCREASING CONSTRUCTION COSTA OKAY. HI CONTINUE SO. SO ANYWAY TO OUR OUR SUGGESTIONS -- AND I WOULD SAY I THINK THE LA -- SAID WE WE DON'T NECESSARILY WE WERE LOOKING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THINGS WE DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE. WITH THEIR SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS EITHER -- A LOT OF IT DEPENDS ON WHAT POLICY OBJECTIVES YOU WANT TO ADDRESS -- ONE THING WE SUGGEST IS OF INCREASING THE SHARE OF THE FUNDING THAT GOES TO THAT LARGE NPO COMPONENT CURRENTLY IT'S 40% OF THE TOTAL BY -- BUT THE SAME TIME. EXCLUDING THEM FROM THE THE STATE WIDE PORTIONS OF ESSENTIALLY THE STATEWIDE COMPONENT WOULD BECOME SOMETHING FOR THE RURAL REGIONS IN THIS AND THE SMALLER REGIONS OF THE COMMISSION WOULD WOULD. OVERSEE -- THIS WOULD ACCOMPLISH A COUPLE OF COULD ACCOMPLISH A COUPLE OF THINGS -- THE REASONS AGAIN HAVE THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS WOULD GIVE THEM MORE OF A TOOL TO TO ADDRESS THE ADDRESS THEIR GOALS -- IT WOULD ALSO ADDRESS THE REGIONAL EQUITY QUESTION TO THE BECAUSE IT WOULD ENSURE THAT EACH. OF THE LARGE REGIONS WAS GETTING THEIR REPORT PROPORTIONATE SHARE WHILE THERE WOULD STILL BE A COMPETITION WITHIN THE REGION -- AND YOU WOULD HAVE REVIEWERS. WITH GREATER FOR WHO HAD GREATER PRESUMABLY GREATER FAMILIARITY WITH THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT AND THEN MIGHT. BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN THE STATEWIDE REVIEWER WHO MAY NOT. HAVE ANY FAMILIARITY WITH WHAT THE PARTICULARS OF THE ISSUES IN THE REGION ARE IN IT WOULD PRESUMABLY HELP THAT MEET THOSE REGIONAL PRIORITIES THEY UPSET BUT THAT NORTE MIGHT HAVE MORE SENSITIVITY TO WILL HOW THE REGION ITSELF WAS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH REGION PRIORITIES AND HOW THE PROJECTS. THAT WERE BEING PROPOSED FIT INTO THAT OVERALL REGIONAL PLAN. SO AND EIGHTY A SIDE EFFECT OF THIS WOULD BE OBVIOUSLY A SMALLER POOL OF PROJECTS THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD BE MANAGING STATEWIDE -- AND SO THAT LEADS INTO OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THAT IF THE COMMISSION HAD A SMALLER. POOL OF PROJECTS -- THEY COULD POTENTIALLY EXPAND THE SIZE OF THEIR REVIEW TEAMS THERE WAS A FRANK TO EARLIER YOU HAVE. OF ONLY TWO REVIEWERS SO YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE FULL RANGE OF EXPERTISE -- LOOKING AT EVERY PROJECT THIS MIGHT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A FIVE OR SIX MEMBER REACHING THAT WAS LOOKING AT EACH PROJECT WHICH WOULD MAYBE -- LIMIT LIMIT SOME OF THAT SUBJECTIVISM -- YOU MIGHT ALSO BE ABLE TO HAVE. AT LEAST ONE OR TWO THE M. P. O.'S AT THE REGIONAL PROCESS HAS A A TWO STEP PROCESS WHERE THEY HAVE REVIEW TEAM TO LOOK AT EACH PROJECTS IN THE TOP. GOING ONES GET ELEVATED TO THE TO HAVE. A SECONDARY PANEL SO THERE'S DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD BE LOOKED OUT THERE -- ARE THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- WOULD BE TO FIND A WAY TO GIVE THE SMALL THOSE EIGHT SMALL NPOS SOME WAY -- TO INFLUENCE PRIORITIZATION THE PROJECTS THAT THEY CARE ABOUT THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT WE DISCUSS ABOUT THAT YOU MIGHT. WE DISCUSSED THAT MIGHT GO INTO THAT -- THE COMMISSION CERTAINLY DOING A LOT. TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND TO DO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE JUST SEARCH THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND FIND WHATEVER WAYS THEY CAN. OUT TO INCREASE THAT TO TO HELP. LOSING THE CRITICAL PROJECT DATA AND WE WOULD PROPOSE A YES THE A FUNDING CAP -- TO SORT OF BALANCE THE NEED FOR THEIR DESIRE FOR TRANSFORMATION PROJECTS WITH -- ALLOWING SO THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO FIND THIS TO GIVING A NUMBER OF PROJECTS TO MAYBE LOOK AT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WOULD BE A TEN MILLION OR TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR. CAP BUT IT CONSIDER THAT AS A WAY TO TRY AND BALANCE THE THE THE MOVE TOWARD LARGER AND LARGER PROJECTS -- WHICH I THINK IS EATING. SMALLER IN READING OF EATING THE PIE MUCH MORE QUICKLY. I THINK THAT MUCH FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION -- HAVE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS BACK TO BRANSON I UNDERSTAND LAURIE WATERS IS SITTING NEXT TO YOU -- THIS THIS THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL -- ITEM YEAH THE THE FUN PART IS THAT WE GET TO DEFINE THE GOALS AND THEN WE HAVE. TO ASK YOU GUYS FOR THE DAD AND FOR DIRECTIONS GIVE COMMENTS ON THESE TWO REPORTS SERVICE WHAT YOU'RE THINKING AND I DID BRING SOME COMMENTS TODAY AND THEN WE WENT TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THAT WOULD WORK SECOND SEASON BRANSON THE COMMISSION AND LAURIE WATERS STORY IS THERE TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM MANAGER SON THANKFUL SHE'S HERE TODAY. I FIRST I WANTED TO JUST I WANTED TO THINK THAT -- YOU IN THE OFFICE OF THIS AN OFFICER RESEARCH FOR THEIR REVIEW OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. AND YOU KNOW THE COMMISSION DEVELOPED THIS PROGRAM IN ITS THREE MUCH COLLABORATION CONSULTATION AND DELIBERATION WE HAVE MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED INTERESTED. STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS PROGRAM. BY FAR THE LARGEST AMOUNT INTEREST AMONG ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. AND SO LAURIE IS WORKING WITH THOSE STAKEHOLDERS -- HUNDREDS OF THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. IT IS ALWAYS OUR PRACTICE TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS TO IMPROVE THE PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. AND THE RICH THIRTIES REPORTS IN THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS WILL BE BOUGHT. I'M SORRY IT WILL BE BROUGHT FORWARD -- AS WE MOVE INTO FOR MUCH DELIBERATION DISCUSSION AS WE DEVELOP THE GUIDELINES FOR THE NEXT A FUNDING CYCLE. THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE SHARED WITH YOU TODAY THAT I DID WHEN IT. A IT IS SURE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR PROGRAM WITH YOU. WE ARE WORKING ON IT WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECT% APPLICATIONS EACH CYCLE OR WORKING. TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO REDUCE THE COSTS OF THE APPLICATIONS. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE BASIC DATA TO MAKE DECISIONS. THESE APPLICATIONS THAT WE HAVE TODAY THAT ARE IN PLACE WHERE WERE THE RESULT OF CLOSE CONSULTATION AND COLLABORATION WITH. HUNDREDS OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE RURAL. THE INSIDE THE THE URBAN SMALL URBAN AND THE RURAL AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE DO HAVE APPLICATIONS DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT TO REDUCE THE COST IN THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WE ARE. ASKING FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED TO ANY AGENCY THAT REQUESTED. AND WE DO KNOW THAT AGENCIES WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PROGRAM. IN THE MOST RECENT CYCLE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE APPLICATIONS ARE IN A DETERRENT TO THE TO APPLYING FOR THE FUNDING. WE HAD NEARLY A HUNDRED MORE APPLICATIONS A CYCLE THAN WE DID IN THE LAST CYCLE. WE RECEIVED FIFTY OF THE APPLICANTS WERE BRAND NEW APPLICANTS THAT WE HAD NOT SEEN APPLY FOR FUNDING IN THE PAST. BUT WE DO KNOW THERE'S IMPROVEMENT TO BE MADE AND WE ARE PLANNING TO CONTINUE. MAKING IMPROVEMENTS IN WERE GREATLY APPRECIATIVE AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE. TODAY AND IN THESE REPORTERS. WITH RESPECT TO OUR EVALUATION OF THE APPLICATIONS WE DO YOU IS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY. ADVISORY GROUP THAT IS REQUIRED IN STATUTE TO REVIEW THE APPLICATIONS. THE TEAM MEMBERS ARE TRAINED -- TO THROUGH A PROCESS THAT. THEY ALL GO THROUGH TRAINING BUT WE DO HAVE COMMISSION STAFF THAT REVIEWS EVERY APPLICATION. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO NORMALIZE THE SCORING AND TO THE TO ENSURE CONSISTENT SOME LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY -- WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DEVIATIONS THE COMMISSION STAFF DOES MEET WITH THE REVIEW TEAM? AND DOES WORK OUT THOSE DISCREPANCIES. AS GUIDELINES ARE DEVELOPED FOR THE NEXT CYCLE FUNDING WE WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH EVERYONE. TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY. REVIEW TEAMS. I DID WANT TO JUST HIT ON THOSE FLOORS AND THE REVIEW TO IN THE PROJECT GOALS. PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED IN THE AFTER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THEY'RE REQUIRED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN. SO THEY'RE ALREADY THAT'S A REQUIREMENT BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO KNOW FROM PROJECT APPLICATION. THAT THIS PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE REGION. GRAHAM DOES FUND VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY HEALTH MOBILITY ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. AND WE DO AGREE WITH THE LA L.. THREE POURED IN WITH THE SAN OFFICER RESEARCH REPORT THAT WE NEED BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE PROJECT DATA. TO QUANTIFY THE PROGRAM BENEFITS THESE THESE PROJECTS ARE JUST NOW COMING TO COMPLETION FROM THE FIRST CYCLE. THE COMMISSION IS IS SHARES THE CONCERN. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH CALTRANS THE ACTUAL TRANSPORTATION TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN HELPING US ON IMPROVEMENTS TO DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. TO ENSURE THE BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN COUNTS ARE UNIFORM AND THAT THE ACCOUNT FOR IS. FOR EXAMPLE FOR SEASONAL VARIATIONS. WE ALSO THE COMMISSION FUNDS TO THE STATE WIDE PROGRAM AN ACT TO TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER. NOT RESOURCE CENTER IS PREDOMINATELY IN PLACE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. BUT IT IS ALSO RIGHT NOW IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A PEDESTRIAN IN USER -- PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE COUNTER PROGRAM TO MORE THIS BORROWING PROGRAM WILL BE IT IS EUIPMENT WILL BE ABLE TO BE CHECKED OUT. BY AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA TO UTILIZE FOR THEIR BEFORE AND AFTER COUNTS SO WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD GREATLY HELP -- WHERE WHERE BLOCKING DATA AT THIS POINT IN TIME? I DO WE DID ONE ADDRESS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE IT -- REQUIRED THE NPOS ARE THE PROJECTS TO COMPETE IN THE STATE Y. COMPONENT BEFORE THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE MPO COMPONENT. WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THIS WAS A BRAND NEW REQUIREMENT IN THE FOURTH CYCLE. OF THE REASON FOR THAT WAS IT WE WERE WE WERE STRAIGHT WE WERE STRIVING TO ACHIEVE. BETTER STATEWIDE DATA COLLECTION. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO REPORT ON THE RESULTS OF THIS PROGRAM. TO THE PUBLIC INTO THE LEGISLATURE IN OTHERS BUT IN LIGHT OF THESE REPORTS WE WILL GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT. AND LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE MEANS TO CUT THAT COLLECT BETTER STATEWIDE DATA. WITH REGARDS TO THE TRANSFORM INTO PROJECTS -- WE ARE YOU KNOW THERE IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW IT'S A TRANSFORM INTO PROJECT. AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS WHERE IN THE PAST YOU MIGHT OF BEEN SINGLE COMPONENTS BROUGHT FORWARD BUT THERE IT. THERE ARE ENTITIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE PUTTING TOGETHER NETWORKS THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER CLOSING GAPS CREATING A LARGE NETWORK AND SO THE COMMISSION IS IS AGREES WE AGREE WITH THE LA US REPORT IN THIS IN OFFICE RESEARCH THAT THOSE PROJECTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IN THE COMMISSION THIS LAST CYCLE ENCOURAGED THOSE TYPES APPROACH PROJECTS TO COME FORWARD AND SO WE DID SEE AN INCREASE IN THE APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS -- WE I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE IN A DAY AND THE CHRISTIANS FUNDED MORE THOSE PROJECTS A CYCLE. BUT THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE PROGRAM. HAS NOT BEEN DIRECTED TO TRANSFORM INTO PROJECTS. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION HAS WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL URBAN AND RURAL. OF PROJECTS ARE WILL CERTAIN NOT FORGOTTEN AND SO THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMISSION -- SO I THINK EIGHT A I GUESS THE LASTLY FIVE TWENTY TWO MUCH TIME HERE LASTLY I WOULD JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- THE ONLY A REPORT -- DOES CONSIDER FUNDING THE REGIONAL COMPONENT AS A LUMP SUM. AND WE DO AGREE WITH THE LA L. THAT IF FRIENDS ARE. AND PROVIDED THROUGH THE LUMP SUM IT IN THE REGIONAL COMPONENT IT WOULD REMOVE THE PROJECT LEVEL OVERSIGHT THAT THE COMMISSION HAS. THIS COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SENATE BILL ONE ACCOUNTING ACCOUNTABILITY -- REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND THE COMMISSION'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY GUIDELINES -- AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAPLE OF THE COMMISSION AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN CONSIDER. HOW TO DRESS BUT AS AN EXAMPLE THE COMMISSION DOES REQUIRE TIME LISA FUNDS TIMELY USE OF FUNDS? AND SO IF A PROJECT IS DEDICATED FUNDING IT DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD. WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. THIS PROJECT FUNDS TO LAPSE AND WERE ABLE TO REDIRECT THOSE FUNDS TO A PROJECT THAT IS READY TO GO. AND THAT WOULD BE IT ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT SO I AM HAPPY LAURIE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US WHEN THE MPO I MEAN WE COULD. PUT THAT IN A LANGUAGE THAT THE MPO IF WE GAVE THEM OUT TO THE REGIONS AND THEY HAD A PROJECT THAT LAPSE THE DATE COULD. THEY COULD DIRECT THAT MONEY INTO THEIR THEIR REGION FOR AND THAT THE NXT PROJECTS READY GO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THEY COMES BACK. TO THE MOTHER SHIP AND THEN WE ALL RIGHT NOW ON AND I MAYBE ALL THAT LAURIE BECAUSE HE AND HIS ALREADY HAVE A IN LIKE A WAITING LIST OF SORTS. CELEBRITY ONE YET EACH OF THE MPO SAY HAVE A CONTINGENCY LIST OF PROJECTS THAT IF SHOULD ONE OF THEIR ONES THAT WERE INITIALLY FUNDED. IF THEY WERE TO FAIL OR I'M HAVE SOME SAVINGS THEY CAN. THOSE FUNDS WILL GO BACK TO ONE OF THE PROJECTS THAT'S ON THEIR CONTINGENCY LIST. OKAY. FINANCE DO YOU GUYS HAVE AN OPINION ON IN ANY OF THIS. NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY IS INFORMATIONAL ON LAKE MEMBERS SENATE MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH I DO WANT TO TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU. TO THE TRACTOR FOR ALL OF HER WORK -- ON THIS IMPORTANT FIND. IN AND OBVIOUSLY HAVING. FOCUS ON BOTH URBAN AND RURAL. I THINK ON THE RULES IDC Là URBAN FOLKS COMPANIES. RIGHT -- THE GREAT OUTDOORS A COUPLE OF ITEMS WOULD LIKE TO BE A TALK ABOUT DATA GATHERING YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN. SOME OF THE GAPS. I'M SHE ATE UP FOLKS IN THE TECHNOLOGY I AM ONLY ITEMS THE LA A MENTION IS OBVIOUSLY WANTING TO BE CONSISTENT IN PARTICULAR DURING PEAK SEASON RIGHT. IN HOW YOU ARE EDUCATING ACTUALLY LOCALS ON THOSE COUNTS -- AND NOT DOING IT IN THE WINTER WHEN WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SUMMER FALL KATE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT AND ONE MORE QUESTION DO YOU. I LET. THREE AS WELL -- YES SO WE THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE THE COMMENTS THAT I APPRECIATED MOST FROM THE LA THIS REPORT BECAUSE THAT THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT AND WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS -- COMING WITH COMING UP WITH A WAY. TO WERE A HAVE APPLICATIONS GATHER CONSISTENT DATA AND THAT IS WHERE YOU TAKE YOUR COUNTS THE SAME TIME BEFORE IN THE SAME TIME AFTER. AND THEN USING A CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NOT. A STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGIES OUT THERE ANYWHERE SO WE ARE WORKING ON THAT TO OUR TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEEAND TO THE ACT OF TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER TO DEVELOP THAT IN CALIFORNIA THAT WILL -- I THINK BE A STANDARD PROBABLY FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE L. ABILITY OF LOCAL FUNDS UNDERSTAND IT DOES NEED TO BE LOCAL MATCH. ENABLE TO DEDICATE THOSE DOLLARS TOWARDS THESE EIGHTY P. ELIGIBLE PROJECTS. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT HAS ALSO BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A HURDLE -- BUT CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT -- IN TAKE A DEEPER DIVE. IF I'M UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY WHAT WE SEE AND I CAN GIVE MORE INFORMATION BUT WHAT WE SEE IS A STATE WIDE COMPONENT. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND SMALL URBAN A REAL -- PROJECTS IN THIS SMALL URBAN RIO COMPONENT BUT THEY ARE ALSO COMPETING IN THE STATE Y. COMPONENT. AND SHOULD ON THAT STRUCTURE CHANGE IN THE STATE Y. COMPONENT. THOSE SMALL URBAN ROW. ENTITIES WOULD HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY COMPETINGWITH SOME OF THE THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB IN THE STATE WHERE COMPONENT ACTUALLY THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL. BECAUSE THESE ARE THESE ARE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT. WOULD TAKE THEM MAYBE DECADES TO SAVE UP THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE GAP THAT THEY REALLY NEED -- SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE FINDING. A LOT OF THE PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDING OUR STATE ROUTES TO ARE SAFE PRESS TO SCHOOLS. IN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE GRAVEL THEY ARE AND YOU KNOW THE THE NEEDS ARE GREAT THE NEEDS ARE GREAT ACROSS THE STATE. AND SOME OF THOSE NEEDS WE'RE SEEING ARE ARE VERY PROFOUND IN THE RURAL AND SMALL URBAN AREAS AT THE STATE. ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THAT'S THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE DON'T REQUIRE A MATCH AND THE REASON THAT WE WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION EVERY CYCLE ON IF WE'RE GONNA FIND JUST CONSTRUCTION OR NOT. BUT WE FIND PRECONSTRUCTION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF LOW RESOURCE AGENCIES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO THE PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK. NINE IN I KNOW YOU GET THE FEEDBACK AND THEN -- WE HEAR THE FEEDBACK IS THE BAND WITH IS THE MOST CHALLENGING PART RIGHT. NOT JUST THE APPLICATION BEING ABLE TO DO ALL THE PRE WORK IN IN SOME OF THESE AREAS IN SENSITIVE AREAS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING RIGHT. AND IT COULD BE PAINFUL. BOTH ON COBBLING TOGETHER DOLLARS IN IN BEING ABLE TO GET PROJECT READY SO. I I KNOW THAT IS GREATLY APPRECIATED IN I'M. AT THE AGENCY REALLY STRETCHES. TO MAKE IT WORK AND I JUST WANNA COMPLEMENT YEAH AND SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE. OTHER EIGHTY P. INTO CS YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. JOIN SENATOR MCGUIRE AND THINKING ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND LA OWN OFFICE OF RESEARCH FOR HELPING. TO DRILL DOWN ON THIS A LITTLE BIT. MAY BE YOU ADDRESS THIS BUT WE HEAR THERE'S A BURDEN SOME APPLICATION PROCESS. AND THEN [inaudible] DETERMINING. FOLLOW UP FROM. COUNTERS TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING PEDESTRIAN BIKE WAYS. IS THERE ANY. COMPONENT IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS THAT REQUIRES HOW. THE MEASUREMENTS WILL BE MADE. AND SECONDLY. ARE ANY THE MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE REQUESTED. IS THERE WAITED SHERMAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUT OF A CAR. AND ARE USING A BIKE WAY -- TO COMMUTE TO WORK. VERSUS JUST RECREATIONAL USE. SO TO ANSWER THAT LAST PART DEAD THAT. IS REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND I THINK THE ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT IS -- BY THE TIME OF DAY WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE COUNTS IF YOU IF YOU IF YOU'RE HAVING HIGH COUNTS DURING COMMUTE. HOURS I THINK THAT YOU CAN MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU ARE. TAKING SOME CARS OFF THE ROAD BY PEOPLE USING THE FACILITIES TO COMMUTE THAT WOULD BE ONE WAY BUT I I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING AS WE START THINKING ABOUT WHAT BETTER DATA WE SHOULD GATHER AND WHAT BENEFITS WE SHOULD BE ASSESSED SAYING.% THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ONE THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO USE ALL OUR EXPERTISE TO COME UP WITH THE WAY THAT WE CAN DO THAT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT AGAIN. THAT ME EN MORE LABOR INTENSIVE EIGHTY TO THE PROCESS BUT IT COULD BE THAT IN ADDITION TO COUNTERS. YOU DO JUST. TO A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE INTERVIEWS OF PEOPLE USING THE TRAIL AND THEN EXTRAPOLATE FROM A SAMPLE. OF A SMALL SAMPLE OF PEOPLE DO SOME EXTRAPOLATION. AND REALIZING THAT A LOT OF ENTITIES DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE EXTENSIVE COUNTS THAT MAYBE. SOME OTHERS DO THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER THAT IS DIRECTED BY CALTRANS THEY ARE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO TARGET AREAS THAT NEED THAT HELP IN PROVIDING THAT TO THEM. IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THE FIRST PART OF YOUR QUESTION. HELLO THE AND PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES ARE ARE ANTICIPATED. IS ACTUALLY SUBJECT MATTER THAT WE ARE -- WE ARE DISCUSSING ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW. THIS IS A KEY COMPONENT TO EVALUATION OF ANY PROJECT AND SO WE'RE WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU'D THAT THIRD THE AGENCIES ARE MAKING. AND TO PUT THAT IN WRITING AND SO WE ARE WORKING I GUESS THE COMMITMENT I WOULD WHEN I WOULD WANT TO SHARE TODAY'S COMMISSION IS COMMITTED. ON HAVING THE THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES. AND THE PERFORMANCE REPORTING. BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC AND THIS INFORMATION WE'RE DISCUSSING WITH THE ACTUAL TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. WE ARE IN THE NEXT CYCLE WILL HAVE TO DELVE INTO THIS. ALONG WITH THE DATA COUNTERS IN THE USER ACCOUNTS BUT WE NEED TO GIVE. THESE AGENCIES ALSO THE MEANS BY WHICH THEY CAN TAKE THE BEFORE COUNTS SO THAT WERE YOU KNOW WE SET THEM UP TO SUCCEED PRESUMABLY THAT BECOMES PART OF THE APPLICATION PROGRESS. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THAT. DATA BEFORE AND AFTER YES YES THANK YOU MISTER THE GOALS IS THE SENATE -- SB NINETY NINE WAS. TOO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH TO REDUCE CHILD ABUSE IN ALL THAT SO SO I GUESS IF YOU'RE DOING THE SURVEY YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO BE. WITH THE WALKERS RATHER THE BIKERS AND SORT OF DRIVE ALONG WITH THEM CENTER STERN YOU HAVE A QUESTION. YEAH VERY VERY. QUICKLY THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE AND FOR ALL THE THOROUGH WORK DONE BY SEN OFFICE RESEARCH IN LA -- IN THE C. D. C.'S BEEN A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT HERE SO. I I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOT LEAVING. THE SMALL FOLKS BEHIND. WHILE TRYING TO MAINTAIN SOME BIG VISION. I LOOK AT LOS ANGELES IS A PLACE THAT. IT'S EASY TO GIVE UP ON WHAT IS TAUGHT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTOR TRANSPORTATION IS A THERE'S NO WAY RIGHT IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S THE LAND OF CARS BUT WE'RE SEEING. PROGRESS BEING MADE -- I LOOK AT A PROJECT LIKE THE LA RIVER AS A SORT OF CROSS JURISDICTIONAL. TOUGH PROJECT TO GET EVERYONE TOGETHER ON JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY AUTHORITIES AND IT'S TOUGH TO DO. THE KIND OF BIG VISION WORK THAT THEY PUT IN AN ENHANCE INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE DISTRICT TOGETHER FOR INSTANCES HEART RIGHT BECAUSE YOU NEED A LOT OF BUYING FROM DIFFERENT ENTITIES. WOULD SOMETHING WE'RE WORKING ON AND ALL THE WAY FROM THE ARMY CORPS. INTO YOU KNOW LA COUNTY PUBLIC WORKS CITY D. O. T. TRY TO GET TOGETHER. DO YOU SEE CDC HAVING AN AT LEAST IN. THE A COLLABORATIVE RECORD NATIVE ROLE IN SOME WAY TO TRY TO GET FOLKS TO COME UP WITH VISIONARY PROJECTS YOU SEEING THAT THE THE KIND OF PROPOSALS THAT YOU'D EXPECT FROM. SAY THAT KIND OF SCOPE OF PROJECT FOR YOUR CROSS CITY LINES YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING FIFTY ONE MILES LIKE. WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE DOING BETTER I GUESS IN LA? TO COME UP WITH THAT BIG VISION AND HOW CAN YOU HELP WITH THAT. WE'RE IN THE FOR CYCLE OF THE THE PROGRAM AND WHAT I THINK WE SAW IN THE INITIAL CYCLES IS THAT THERE IS A REALLY PAN OUT NEED. FOR KIND OF LIKE BREAD AND BUTTER PROJECTS OUT THERE THERE WAS A LOT OF NEED SO SO A LOT OF THAT WAS ADDRESSED BUT SO IN THIS LAST CYCLE IN PARTICULAR WE ARE LOOKING TO NOT JUST GETTING. A PROJECT BUT THE BEST PROJECT SO TO THAT END WE ADDED A COUPLE QUESTIONS IN THE APPLICATION FOR THE LARGER PROJECTS THAT WE WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE APPLICANT'S HOW. THEIR PROJECT WAS. USING CONTEXT SENSITIVE SOLUTIONS AND HOW IT WAS TRANSFORMATIVE AND WE WE DID A SOMEWHAT OF A TEST THIS TIME BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT SOMETHING IN THERE THAT THE APPLICANT'S JUST COULD NOT ANSWER AND I WAS JUST SO IMPRESSED BY THE ANSWERS THAT WE GOT ACROSS THE STATE. FROM HOW -- APPLICANTS WERE ABLE -- TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND I THINK THAT IS A SIGN OF HOW. PLANNING FOR ACTOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS HAS ADVANCED EVEN SINCE THE YEARS OF THE ATP SO SINCE THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL QUIRK THOSE WERE SUCCESSFUL QUESTIONS IN THIS CYCLE. I THINK THAT WE WOULD TRY TO EXPAND ON THAT FOR THE NEXT CYCLE. THERE WILL NOTE THAT THERE IS A VERY GOOD BOOK WALKING IN LA DESPITE THE SONG TO THE CONTRARY. ALL RIGHT THIS IS. THIS IS THIS IS ONLY AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF GOOD WHEN I'M GOING TO OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYBODY WHO'S HERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT. ON THIS ARENA ON THE EIGHTY P. PLEASE SIR. MY NAME IS JEFF HARDY KIA I'M A PUBLIC ADVOCATE I AM VERY CONCERNED ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND ONE OF THINGS I WILL SAY AS I'VE BEEN LIVING IN LA AND USE THE BELLONA CREEK AND A FEW OTHER THOSE THINGS WHEN I COULD BUY CAN DO THOSE THINGS. WHAT I AM WILL HERE'S A STRESSED USES TWO THINGS? UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU GUYS TO GET SOME OF YOUR REPORTING BACK OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND I'LL USE THE EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS WHERE IT WAS SENATOR BEALE. OF WHAT THE SUCCESS OF THE SB ONE FUNDING. THAT OCCURRED BUT FOR SACRAMENTO IN THEIR RUSH TO DO THAT THE FORCE BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THROUGH CALTRANS. THE JAY STREET. AS A BICYCLE PATH. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU NEED TO LOOK AND SEE WHAT IS WORKING AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS GROUP'S MISTAKES WHATEVER I WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER. DISABILITY WISE. SAY COG LOCALLY HERE DID NOT REALIZE CONSIDER DISABILITY WHEN THEY WERE DOING THE THOMAS VEHICLES SO THE ECONOMIST THING THAT IS GOING FROM SIXTY FIFTH STREET. FOUR SACKS STATE. ONE OF THEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE DISABILITY OR IT NOW THE SEX STATE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENTS REALIZE THE USEFULNESS OF THAT AND THEY'RE CONVERTING THE OTHERS SO MANY CHARMS ON ELECTRIC VEHICLES. IT'S NOT BEING PLANNED TO CONSIDERED. AND YOU GOT THE NEXT TEN PLUS YEARS WE ARE FAR MORE SENIOR COMMUNITIES AND YOU HAVE FAR MORE OF THE INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE LIKE WHAT HE'S NEEDING THIS YOU ARE DEALING WITH AIR TRAVEL BUT SOUTHWEST AND A COUPLE OTHERS HAD THE PROBLEM. TOO MANY OF THESE VEHICLES. EIGHT THEM AROUND SO IT'S SOMETHING I WOULD INVITE AS YOU GUYS DO MORE WITH THE REAL CONSIDERATION THE OTHER THINGS. PLEASE GET YOUR REPORTS BACKS YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON ALSO CATCH UP AS FAR AS KNOWLEDGE IN THAT HATE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN THESE TYPE OF APPARATUSES AND THAT'S WARY WAITED HERE FOR THIS. BECAUSE I'VE GOT OTHER COMMITTEES TO GO TO BUT BOB THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO EXPRESS TO ALL OF YOU. THAT PLEASE. LOOK AT THAT AND LOOK THROUGH THOSE OTHER SET OF EYES. ANOTHER RESPONSE I'M THINKING AS FAR AS YOUR CAR OWNERS IS THE POOREST SYSTEM. IS FOR DISABILITY ACCOUNTING THROUGH THERE NOW THERE'S A SECOND FEATURE WITH YOU PUSH ON THE ADDITIONAL BUTTONS THE GIVES YOU A CLUE ABOUT TYPICALLY THE LOCATION. AND I'M SUGGESTING MAYBE FOR SOME PLACES FOR YOUR PEOPLE COUNTERS BUT MAYBE YOU CONSIDER SOME CARP OF INITIATING WHERE YOU'RE GETTING THAT WERE COUNT WHETHER IT'S DISABILITY WHETHER SOMETHING ELSE. WHETHER YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE BIKING OR SOMETHING ELSE FOR SOME OF THE PLACES IN TRAILS THAT YOU CAN GET AN IDEA. YOU KNOW RATHER THAN JUST SENDING A PERSON THERE AND SITTING DOWN IT'S JUST LIKE HERE WITH DEALING WITH THE MOBILE APPS. THE JUMP BIKES THE OTHER THINGS MAJOR PROBLEM. IS WHERE THEY'RE BEING PLACE SO THE APT IS GOING THROUGH THEY'RE TAKING THE PICTURE SHOWING THE PROBLEMS. IN GETTING LETTER LASTLY WILL SAY TO YOU IS THIS SACRAMENTO TRYING BY TWENTY TWENTY TO DO GREATLY ELECTRIFICATION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY ALSO BE COMING INTO THE STATE JADA REVIEW AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HAPPEN THERE AND SEEN A PRIVATE AND SEEING WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. YOU CAN COLLECT BACK TO GUIDE YOUR DECISIONS ON THE FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE NEXT WHEN I KNOW THAT. THE FITBIT IN THE GOOGLE WATCH FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO NOT IGNORE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE EASILY AVAILABLE TO US YES [inaudible] MORNING. WHEN THE COMMISSION WITH A CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION WE ARE A NONPROFIT STATEWIDE? ORGANIZATION THAT HAS WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ATP REALLY CATERS. TO ALL THE NEEDS -- IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WE WERE ENGAGED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROGRAM AFTER THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE FUNDS. AND CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND AND LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY -- WE APPRECIATE THE LA -- AND THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH REALLY TAKING A DEEP DIVE INTO WHAT IS HAPPENING ANNA AND REALLY WHAT A PROGRAM THAT'S INTO STILL IT'S INCUBATING PHASE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GROWTH OVER THE PAST FOUR CYCLES BUT WE STILL ARE YET TO SEE THE THE THE PROJECTS REALLY TAKE. OFF BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY COMPLETED THE FIRST ROUND. THE NUMBER OF THINGS HAVE BEEN SAID I HAD DIRECTOR BRANSON AND AND MORE WATERS HAVE CLARIFIED SOME SOME OF THE ISSUES -- BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE A FEW THINGS I APPRECIATE YOUR LISTENING INTENTION. SO FIRST OF ALL AT THE IT HAS TO BE EMPHASIZED THIS IS A HEAVILY UNIQUE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS I'D DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AN AND COMPETITIVE. PROGRAMS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WITH THE CDC HAS DONE IS SERVED AS A SORT OF A AN ENTITY THAT'S CONTINUE TO KEEP THINGS CONSISTENT. AND IN THE DIRECTION OF CONSENSUS BUILDING AMONG VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS LIKE ACROSS THE STATE A AND AND VARIOUS INTERESTS RIGHT SO IT'S IT'S HELPED TO MANAGE ALL OF THOSE TYPES OF ACCOMMODATIONS IT'S BEEN A NEGOTIATION -- ENTITY AMONG THESE. THESE AT THESE SAY HOLDERS IT'S HAS A A ROBUST AND ENGAGED A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING EVERY. A QUARTER QUARTERLY REALLY -- CONSISTS A CONSISTING OF VISITATION OF MPO SMALL RUN RULE. LOCAL ADVOCACY AND STATE RIGHT ADVOCACY SO AGAIN AT HEAVILY -- ENGAGEMENT HAD. ON ON THAT SIDE SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF EYES LOOKING AT THIS PROGRAM REGULARLY AND HOW CAN BE IMPROVED ANOTHER THING TO ADD. AT LAST CYCLE THERE WAS TEN I BELIEVE WORKSHOPS STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOPS ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT'S AGAIN AN UNPRECEDENTED FOR SOMETHING ON THIS LEVEL SO. THIS IS REALLY A PROGRAM OF THE OF THE GRASSROOTS THAT THE GROUNDWORK I ALL OF THE DIFFERENT VOICES AT AT THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS. ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES AND THAT WE SEE IS THAT THIS IS AN OVERSUBSCRIBED PROGRAMTHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED -- YOU KNOW AT THIS LAST CYCLE THERE WAS ABOUT A TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR ASKED TOTAL -- AND ONLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION AVAILABLE I AM BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT'S APPLIED TO IF YOU LOOK AT ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANTS ACROSS THE STATE ACROSS EVERY COMMUNITY. FOR CITY OF THE OF COLTON FOR EXAMPLE IN SAMBHAR DINO AT THAT'S AFFECTED BY QUITE A BIT OF OF TRUCK TRAFFIC SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S A DISADVANTAGE COMMUNICANT ON IN THERE. IT'S A FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED I BELIEVE IT A FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND IS THE POPULATION BUT THEY'RE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO BUILD IT OUT IS FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SO. THAT'S JUST A SMALL COMMUNITY IF YOU LOOK AT RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN THEIR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT'S SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SO. BUILDING OUT OUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLANS TAKES QUITE A BIT OF INVESTMENT THAT THIS PROGRAM CAN'T YOU KNOW MEET AT AT ITS CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS SO IT'S CREATED A COMPETITIVE -- QUITE A COMPETITIVE EDGE AND AND SO. THAT'S REALLY THE ROOT OF A LOT OF THE ISSUES PROCESS WISE AND AND HOW THINGS ARE EVALUATED AGAIN THAT'S BEEN. HEAVILY. DESIGNED BY ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ENGAGEMENT LEVELS AT EACH LEVEL AND AND THE EVALUATOR TEAMS YEAH THESE ARE. NATIONALS THAT VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL MONTHS TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW CAN WE AS A STATE MEET THE STATE BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM. AND NOT AN END THE REGION AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL THERE'S DEFINITELY PRIORITIES -- BUT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE APPLYING OUR SMALLER COMMUNITIES AREN'T THEY MAY NOT THEY'LL BE OVERLOOKED IN REGIONAL -- PRIORITIES OFTEN -- AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTAINABLE THE THE I'M INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS CONTINUED GROWTH AT THE OTHER BEING THAT -- THERE'S A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THAT'S BEEN. BUT IT HERE AND IT AND IT'S FREE OFTEN WE ARE WE ARE OURSELVES AND OUR STATE PARTNERS PROVIDE THIS. AND ALSO -- SEE FROM SCHOOL NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP THAT'S NOT HERE TODAY SO THERE'S THAT AND AND THAT THE ACTOR TRANSPORTATION RESOURCE CENTER SO THERE'S DEFINITELY. A DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT MORE FUNDING CAN I GO TO PLACES OF NEED AND BUT WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE SCALE OF THAT NEED AND HOW REGION'S CAN LOOK AT OHER SOURCES OF FUNDING TO MEET. MAYBE THE SMALLER -- AT TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE MORE YOU KNOW LIKE WE SAID BROWN BUTTER BUT LOOK AT BACK TO TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM IS TRYING TO ME A LOT OF DIFFERENT GOALS RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME SO. I HAVE CREDIT MORE TO SAY DON'T TAKE MORE TIME BUT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU THANKS. HI GOOD MORNING A SURVEYOR WITH CALIFORNIA LOCKS ME ONE ECHO A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUE LINDA MADE FROM CAL BY CAN JUST COSTA MOTHERS TO ATTENTION. AND I'LL TRY TO BE CONCISE -- SO I DO WANT TO ECHO THE FACT THAT THE PROGRAM NEEDS MORE FUNDING AND THERE JUST ISN'T ENOUGH TO GO AROUND FOR ALL THE NEEDS OF THE STATE -- I WANNA APPLIED AT DIRECTOR BRANSON AND LAURIE WATERS WHO DO A PHENOMENAL JOB OF MANAGING THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND REALLY BEING INCLUSIVE AND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS MENTIONED BY THE DIRECTOR. TRANSPARENT WITH THE PROCESS IN WITH BUILDING UP THE GUIDELINES -- FOR THIS PROGRAM THE OTHER THING I WANT TO CALL OUT THAT WAS MENTIONED DEBATE I BELIEVE IN LA RAIL AND THERE IS AN OFFICE OF RESEARCH WHICH WE WERE ALSO PART OF SAID THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME AND AND ATTENTION ON THAT -- BUT I WANT TO CALL OUT THIS AB SORT OF THOUGHT AS YOU KNOW THE MPO IS BEING ABLE TO PRIORITIZE PROJECTS AND WHAT YOU'LLSEE IN TERMS OF THE STATE COMPETITION IS THAT THE PROJECT APPLICANTS ARE VERY DIVERSE -- WHILE THEY ALL AS DIRECTOR BRANSON CALLED OUT FALL WITHIN THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLAN BUT WE DO SEE IS THAT SOME OF THOSE MAY NOT BE HIGHLY PRIORITIZE BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALLER PROJECTS PHYLLIS SIDEWALK. AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THINGS THAT ARE HELPING CHILDREN WALK TO SCHOOL BACK TO SCHOOL COMMUNITIES ACROSS A BUSY STREET TO GET TO A GROCERY STORE SO THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT FALL HIGH IN A PRIORITY FOR REGIONAL PLANT. BUT ARE VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR COMMUNITY AND ARE SOMETHING THAT THE STATE STILL NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE PROJECTS AND WHAT GOES INTO THAT KNOW FUNDED IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. AND WE SEE THAT AS A STRENGTH OF THE PROGRAM TO FUND THESE DIVERSE PROJECTS THAT MAY NOT BE HIGHER ON PRIORITY BUT STILL FALL WITHIN THE PLAN. AND THEN HAVE THAT 40% ALLOCATION AND PO'S TO PRIORITIZE THOSE FUNDS AS THOUGH WE DEFINITELY SEE THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THE SPLIT AS IT IS. I'M I THINK THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS AGAIN GOING BACK TO JUST YOU KNOW THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS PROGRAM ONLY ONE CYCLE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO INTO THE FIFTH CYCLE. AND DOING ANY DRASTIC FUNDING CHANGES AT THIS POINT MAY BE TOO SOON I'M SO WE DEFINITELY URGE I'M VERY HEAVY CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF ANY OF THOSE CMMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN BOTH REPORTS -- JUST IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THE GREAT NEED THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHAT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS COULD E. AS DIRECTOR BROWN SAND LIMITED DATA IN TERMS OF HOW THESE IMPACTS OF ROLLOUT. FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR A SMALL GROUP IN IN RULE I'M AND ALSO FOR A LARGER URBAN SETTINGS IN TERMS OF CHANGING THE PRIORITIES SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND AGAIN WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE A GREATER. PRIORITY IN FUNDING FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU'RE WELCOME AN WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING I AM ASSUME THE WALKERS AND BIKERS ARE DELIGHTED THAT WE DOUBLED THAT THE FUNDING AND LAST YEAR.

WHICH WHEN YOU DO THAT AND IT WORKS OUT IN YOUR RIGHT. IT'S GREAT IF IT IF YOU IF YOU'RE WRONG IT'S NOT GREAT BUT WE WE WORK FOR THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND WHAT IT'S MEANT IS THAT WE ARE CLOSING THAT THE ONLY ALL WEATHER ROAD INTO YOSEMITE -- IN ADVANCE OF THE MUD FLOWS WHICH MEANS THERE'S A PROTECTING PROPERTY IN LIFE AND IT'S AND IT'S WORKING WELL AND WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT CHANGING THE AT DOING THAT STATEWIDE SINCE IT HAS WORKED OUT -- WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS TO DO ALL OVER THE STATE TO PROACTIVELY MANAGE FOR THOSE TYPES OF EMERGENCIES -- WE ALSO HAVE -- OBVIOUSLY OUR SYSTEM IS OLD YOU ALL KNEW THAT WHEN YOU UP.

GIVEN ANYBODY FREE PASSED TODAY BUT THE HILL. ACTING DIRECTOR WEB WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US OKAY SO. THE FIRST ISSUE IS. ANTHONY WHAT THE L. L. WAS GONNA TALK ABOUT THE THE A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCOUNT SORRY FOR ANTHONY SYMBOL FROM ILIO -- AS YOU KNOW THE MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT THEM VA RECEIVES REVENUE FROM VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES AS WELL AS DRIVER'S LICENSE FEES. THIS ACCOUNT PRIMARY SPORTS DMV CH P. AND AIR RESOURCES BOARD. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS OR ACTION EVER OVER MANY YEARS THAT THIS ACCOUNT HAS HAD SOME -- FISCAL PRESSURES THAT STORE IT'S BEEN STRUGGLING. IN MANY CASES THE AMOUNT EXPENDITURES FROM THE ACCOUNT HAVE A EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES COMING INTO THE ACCOUNT. BECAUSE OF THIS THE GOVERNOR JERRY BUDGET -- INCLUDE A VERY PROPOSED ADDRESS SORT OF THE CONDITION OF THE ACCOUNT -- SOME OF THE POSES INCLUDED USING GENERAL FUND OF TO FIND SOMEONE TIME BECAUSE THAT I DIDN'T TYPICALLY FIND AND FROM MVA. ALSO PROPOSE CHANGING HOW WE FIND SEIZE PEOPLE'S FACILITY REPLACEMENTS. SHIFTING FROM A PAY AS YOU GO APPROACH TO FINANCING THEM OVER TIME. AND YOU ALSO PROPOSED TO SUSPEND CERTAIN DMV SPEAK UP ALLEY PROJECTS. DESPITE THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET PROJECTED THAT OF THAT MOTOR VEHICLE COUNT WOULD BECOME INSOLVENT BY TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR -- AS PART OF THIS APRIL FINANCE LETTER THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY INCLUDED OTHER PROPOSALS THAT IMPACT THE NBA. ON THE SPENDING SIDE AS YOU WILL DISCUSS THE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING E'S PROPOSING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR THE TOP PART OF MOTOR VEHICLES. TO ACCOMMODATE THAT COSTS AS WELL AS THE ADDRESS THE PROJECTED INSOLVENCY INCLUDES OTHER PROPOSALS TO BENEFIT THE MVA -- SOME IS RECALL THOSE INCLUDE -- SUSPENDING FOR OF ON A FIVE YEAR. BASIS A TRANSFERRED TO HAS GONE ANNUALLY -- FROM THE NVA TO THE GENERAL FUND THESE ARE FEES ARE SORT OF MISCELLANEOUS FEES THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES COLLECTS THAT ARE. GOVERNED BY ARTICLE NINETEEN OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION SO THEY'RE NOT RESTRICTED TO BE USED FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES ON LIKE THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION FEES FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU ALSO PROPOSES. TO WHEN YOU GO ONLINE WHAT THE CUSTOMERS WANT OF SORT OF RENEW THEIR VEHICLE REGISTRATION ONLINE -- THE STATE FROM THE NBA PACES PAYS THE CREDIT CARD TRANSACTION FEES WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS USE A CREDIT CARD. SO IN ORDER TO BENEFIT THE NVA HE'S PROPOSING THAT WE PASSED THAT CREDIT CARD CHARGE ON TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO USES A CREDIT CARD. BASED ON ALL IS VERY PROPOSALS BY THE ADMINISTRATION PROJECTS THAT OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THEM VA WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RESERVE. RANGING OR NEXT FIVE YEARS FROM AND F ABOUT. THREE HUNDRED FIFTEEN MILLION TO BEHIND FIFTY FIVE MEN SO MUCH BETTER THAN WHATTHE OUTLOOK LIKE THAT LOOKED IN JANUARY. I'M HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE GUMS OPOSE I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST PROVIDE IF YOU COM IS FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT. FIRST IN TERMS OF WHATACTIONS YOU NEEDED YOU TO HELP THEM THEY REALLY KIND OF THE FIRST ARTS WITH YOUR EXPENDITURE PRIORITIES -- DO YOU WANT TO FIND AT A HIGHER LEVEL THE GOVERNOR BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER THINGS YOU WANT TO FIND AT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSING OR DO YOU WANT TO FIND AT A LOWER LEVEL MEANING YOU MAY NOT APPROVE ALL THE INCREASES YOU WANT TO PROVIDE TO THE DMV OR OTHER. OTHER DEPARTMENTS. THE SECOND THING IS REALLY THINK ABOUT THE LONG TERM OUTLOOK OF THE NB AS I MENTIONED THE NB AS HAD PROBLEMS OVER MANY YEARS. AND NOT JUST THIRDS SORT OF THINK ABOUT THE SHORT TERM OR REALLY THE LONG TERM. ONE OF THE PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S HAS SUSPEND FOR FIVE YEARS FUNDAMENTAL PENSION PAYMENTS I'M FROM THE NBA THIS IS RELATED. TO AN ACTION TAKEN AS PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT WERE WE BORROWED. BY SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE STATE'S I'M CASH BALANCES TO MAKE A SUPPLEMENT OF A PAYMENT TO THE CALPERS RETIREMENT SYSTEM. THE IDEA WAS THAT THE VERY SPECIAL FUNDS THAT MAKE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS WILL REPAY THIS LOAN OVER TIME. THE GOVERNOR SAYS THE SAME BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT. HE'S PROPOSING IN FOR DMV ARE REALLY FOR LIKE REAL ID IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME MORE OF THE NEAR TERM HIS PROPOSED THAT WE DON'T MAKE ANY PAYMENTS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND PUSH US OUT WORK. WELL WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT DOES HELP YOU IN THE NEAR TERM BUT THAT MEANS YOUR PAYMENTS IN THE I. YEARS AFTER THE FIVE YEARS GO UP AND WE HAVE TO PAY THIS LOAN BY -- G. JUNE THIRTIETH. TWO THOUSAND THIRTY IT ALSO YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS THE WHILE SOME OF THE COSTS ARE REALLY IDENTIFIED MAYBE ME NEAR TERM FOR TEAM VIA NEXT FIVE YEARS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE AFTER FIVE YEARS YOU COULD HAVE INCREASE BECAUSE FOR C.. SHOULD TEACH BE IMPORTING CARS. THE DMV IS TRYING UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS IT PROJECTS THOSE COSTS TO BE INCURRED AFTER THE FIVE YEARS AGO AGAIN YOU REALLY WANT TO THINK ABOUT MORE LONG TERM. THE SECOND PROPOSAL COMING ON ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ENVY IS REALLY HIS REPOSE AT THE SUSPEND FOR FIVE YEARS THIS TRANSFER THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER FROM THE NBA DID TO THE GENERAL FUND. THIS TRANSFER BEGAN IF IT DOESN'T NINE TEN IT WAS PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND CONDITION. THE LECTURE DRESSY TOOK THE% INITIATIVE AND TOOK THIS ACTION ON A ONE YEAR BASIS AND THEN THE FONG YOUR BECAUSE THE STATE'S CONDITION.

AS IT RELATES -- TO A LOT OF THESE OPTIONS AS AS A DEPARTMENT WE COORDINATE AND AND WORK WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE ON AS IT RELATES TO TWO METHODOLOGIES IN REGARDS TO HOW THE FACILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT -- ARE PICTURED. IN REGARDS TO EFFICIENCIES THE DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS. LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITIES -- FOR EFFICIENCIES ARE ACTING DIRECTOR WILL WILL SPEAK TO THAT ALL THE MORE THAT'S FROM THAT'S DEFINITELY IN HER WILL HOUSE.

AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON AS IT RELATES -- TO PROJECTIONS PROVIDING THEM THE DATA TO STICKS. MAYBE WE CAN GO IN TWO STEPS THEN -- I I GUESS WE ARE DEAL WITH FIRST AND THEN. GO BACK TO THE ACTING DIRECTOR. YES THANK YOU THE I WOULD JST POINT OUT ON IN THE AGENDA ON PAGE. TWENTY FIVE WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR OUTLOOK HERE. AND WHILE WE ARE PUSHING OUT THE SUPPLEMENT PENSION PAYMENTS REQUIRED BY -- SENATE BILL EIGHTY FOUR WE BEGIN. MAKING THE PAYMENTS AGAIN AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YOU'LL SEE. THE BOTTOM LINE A RESERVE OF TWO HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAS GROWN FROM YOU SEE THE BOTTOM THERE ON BUT YOU'RE CLOSE TO TWO IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FROM A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION SO WE'RE GROWING FAVORITE THE RESERVE. DESPITE PUSHING THE PAYMENTS OUT AND WE'RE MAKING YEAH. BIGGER PAYMENTS. IN THE OUT YEARS SO. THAT WAS DONE TO ACCOMMODATE. THE RELY DE APRIL ONE BUDGET REQUEST -- WHILE KEEPING THE THE FUND SOLVENT AND KEEPING THE RESERVE ABOVE. A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

WOULDN'T WE EXPECT FINANCED AS SAY LET'S RESTATED. DE ID. EITHER WE HAVE TO TO HELP WITH THE NBA. WHEN I HEARING THAT? IT'S AN OPTION. I THOUGHT IT IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE AN OPTION. I'LL POINT OUT THAT. THE REGISTRATION FEE IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE FUND. D. D. DRIVER'S LICENSE APPLICATION FEE IS BELIEVE THIRTY SIX DOLLARS RIGHT NOW YOU YOU'D HAVE. TO LIKELY REYES SAYS SIGNIFICANTLY TO COVER ANYTHING ANY OF THOSE COSTS [inaudible] DIRECTOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR CASKEY AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS KATHY WEBB ACTING DIRECTOR WITH THE COURTS.

INTO OUR MIX THAT THAT'S JUST A NORMAL PROCESS AND THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE REGULAR REAL ID. BUT IT IS THIS ONE TIME EFFORT AND AND I DON'T SEE IT AS BEING AN ONGOING I THINK ONGOING WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE LOOKING AT ARE WE ACTUALLY -- SECURING THE APPROPRIATE FEES TO PAY FOR THE COST TO RUN THE DMV THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING WE CAN ALWAYS TALK ABOUT.

THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. SO THE PUBLIC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION FUND IS IT WAS ESTABLISHED. TO SIXTY SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO AND CURRENTLY THERE'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX PROJECTS STATEWIDE THAT UTILIZES. THIS MECHANISM IN ORDER TO FINANCE PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A CASH CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENT -- FACTS IN THE COUPLE CASES SUCH AS A MILITARY HEADQUARTERS OR IT RESOURCES BOARD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA -- LAB THESE ARE DEPARTMENTS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN USED PLEASE REVENUE BONDS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I'VE BEEN HEARING LAST YEAR AND AND THIS YEAR IS THAT FINANCING COSTS MORE AND WHILE THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE WE CALCULATED IT'S A OUT IF IF YOU DISCOUNT IT TURNS OUT TO BE ABOUT 20% GREATER THAN CASH FUNDING. HOWEVER THAT ASSUMES CASH AND LEASE FINANCE PROJECTS WITH START THE SAME TIME. WITH THE CHALLENGES FACING THE NBA IN THE ABSENCE OF LEASE FINANCING THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME IS THAT THESE. THREE PROJECTS TO BE DEFERRED. FOR THREE FOUR FIVE YEARS. IN WHICH CASE BECAUSE ESCALATION ON CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN EXCEEDING CPI. YOUR INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OF OF FINANCING DECLINE EVEN FURTHER OR MAYBE EVEN EVEN DECLINE ALL THE WAY TO BE EQUAL PLUS. THE H. P. WOULD HAVE TO SPEND THREE FOUR FIVE MORE YEARS IN FACILITIES THAT HAVE CRITICAL DEFICIENCIES. THANK YOU. LEN TO GROUP THAT. I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK WITH OUR OFFICE IN A JUST A 20% INCREASE IN AND AND COST. OVER WITH THE DISCOUNT AND THEN THIS CONCERNED AT THAT SINCE THE VULNERABILITY OF THE MBA THAT IF YOU CAN'T GO OUT TO BID TOMORROW. YOU MADE THE LADIES IN. NOTHING GETS CHEAPER HERE RIGHT. I'M -- I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT OUR OFFICE WHO ARE MORE EXPERT IN THE AREA HOW MUCH YOU DISCOUNT. DUE TO INFLATIO AND ULTIMATELY THE WAY YOUR COSTS ARE FEES PROJECTS AND THEN HAVE OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WITH DESPITE REFINEMENT. FINANCE ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD BE DELAYED IF WE SWITCH TO A FRONT THAT PAYS YOU GO APPROACH TO THE LEASING APPROACH. I JUST YOU KNOW. WE ARE ONLY UP HERE IN THE THE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR A WHILE AND HE DID THIS IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM WITH THE NBA. AND IT A WELL IT'S A TOUGH TOUGH OF FOR PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO TO GET US ON A PASS THAT WE FIX IT. THERE'S YOU KNOW THIS IS A CREATIVE WAY TO CONTINUE THE PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER. UNDER UNDER YOUR SCORE WE NOBODY HAS SAID ABOUT THE NBA IS GONNA COME BACK IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT. TO MAKE A CHANGE IS JUST THIS IS THE FUN THAT WE USE WERE NOT PROPERLY FUNDING IT SO. IT'S GOING TO HOLD THE MATTER -- MEMBERSHIP ANYBODY HAVE I MEAN I HAVE NO POBLEMS ON THE ACTUAL PROJECTS WE WENT THROUGH THAT LAST YEAR AND WE LOOK AT THAT THAT'S IT'S THE WELL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THE END OF THIS SESSION WAS MOVE THE ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY TWO THIS IS RETAIL CRIME TASK FORCE IS IMPORTING A. B.. TEN SIXTY FIVE YES WE'RE ALSO REQUESTING FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THE REGIONAL PROPERTY CRIMES TASK FORCE. AS DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND ASSEMBLY BILL AT TEN SIXTY FIVE ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION ORGANIZED CRIME COSTS. UNITED STATES RETAILERS NEARLY THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS HERE. RETAILERS NATIONWIDE HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY ORGANIZED CRIME AND SOPHISTICATED SHOPLIFTING RINGS. THESE ORGANIZATION CONSISTENT TEAMS OF THESE THAT STEAL FROM RETAIL STORES AND THEN BRING STONE GOES TO A CENTRAL LOCATION. THE ITEMS ARE SOLD ONLINE AND MY ONLINE VENDORS WERE SHIPPED TO LOCATIONS -- OTHER LOCATIONS FOR SALE. HISTORICALLY VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA RESPOND TO RETAIL CRIME. PROBLEMS INDEPENDENTLY. AND ACCORDING TO AB THE CRIME IS OF AB TEN SIXTY FIVE DISEASE PLEASE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH A REGIONAL PROPERTY CRIMES TASK FORCE. IN COORDINATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO ORGANIZED RETAIL CRIME. IN THE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED REGIONS OF THE STATE. NOW LAST YEAR THE SIEGE BE WE COMBINED EFFORTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT THE SAN FRANCISCO DIS OFFICE. IN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE TO CONDUCT A COMPLEX INVESTIGATION. INTO RETAILS AT PEPPERING IN THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THIS OPERATION FOCUS ON THE FACT OF OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STOLEN PROPERTY. AND RESULTED IN THE ISSUANCE OF EIGHTEEN ARREST WARRANTS AND BREAKING UP OF THE COP COMPLEX. THAT BRING. BUT RETAIL THEFT IS NOT. YOUR LIMITED TO JUST SAN FRANCISCO. WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OTHER ALLIED AGENCIES. TO IDENTIFY OTHER PROBLEM AREAS IN THE STATE. AND WE'LL WORK IT OUT AGENCIES TO INCLUDE THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES TO DETERMINE THE BEST AREAS TO DEVOTE OUR RESOURCES AND FOCUS COMBINED EFFORTS. NOW WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED AGENCIES SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE DA'S OFFICE. THE SAN DIEGO DIS COUNTY DIS OFFICE ESCONDIDO PD. AND THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING. IN A REACH OUT THAT AT THE OF TASK FORCES. TO COMPLY WITH AB SIXTY FIVE WERE PROPOSING THE FUNDING FOR SIXTEEN POSITIONS ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED COSTS. FOR ASKING FOR THREE SERGEANTS POSITIONS TO SUPERVISE THE OPERATIONAL UNITS. AND NINE OFFICER POSITIONS TO PERFORM SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATION. AND ENFORCEMENT. TARGETING ORGANIZE RETAIL THEFT. THESE OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS WILL WORK PROPERLY -- WITH THE DOJ AND LOCAL AGENCIES TO COMBAT ORGANIZED CRIME. THIS REQUEST BUT WILL ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR ONE ANALYST POSITION TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE COORDINATION. AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO THE TASK FORCE. ALONG WITH THAT THREE OFFICE TECHNICIAN POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE DAILY ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE TASK FORCE. WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR THE ABILITY TO THE CONTRACT WITH D. O. G. AGENTS WHEN FEASIBLE. SAYS SPECIFIC WORKING AREAS ARE GONNA FIGHT THE AVAILABILITY OF THE DEAL A DEAL J. AGENTS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS DISSIPATE THE TASK FORCE WILL BE DETERMINED. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ESTABLISH RESOURCES INCLUDING PERSONAL APPOINTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT NECESSARY. TO PROPEL -- FOR THE SEIZE PETE TO PROPEL THE REQUIREMENTS AS OUTLINED IN A. B. [inaudible] TEN SIXTY FIVE LEóN. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS TO HIM -- THIS THE FIRST IS THAT DOJ HAS SUBMITTED A B. C. B. ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS FOR ONE POSITION AND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S COMING CONSIDERED AND YOUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE. FIVE THE OTHER ISSUE IS ON THE TWO POINT ONE MILLION TO CONTRACT WITH DOJ IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT LEVEL OF RESOURCES IF ANY THE OJ WOULD BE PROVIDING. AND SO THE COMMITTEE WILL REALLY WANT KIND OF A FIRM ANSWER TO HOW THE RESOURCES WILL BE USED BEFORE TAKING ACTION ON THIS ITEM. IT CAUGHT MY EYE DID IT'S FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN. GENERAL FUNDS PURSES THEM THE OTHER. PARTS OF THIS PROP FORTY SEVEN ISSUE SAID THERE'S OTHER POTS OF MONEY AROUND FINANCED YOU HAVE. IT WILL FINANCES FINANCIER. WHY GENERAL FUNDS? MAN MARTIN DEPARTMENT FINANCE -- AS YOU KNOW SEATS PEACEABLY FUND WITH NBA AND THIS WOULD NOT BE AN APPROPRIATE USE OF THE MPA RESOURCES. GO AGAIN -- THIS RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT THE LA -- WAS WHAT THE WORKLOADS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. IF I COULD ADDRESS THAT -- PART OF THE REASON WE BUILT IN THE MONEY FOR THE DEAL. J. AGENTS INTO C. H. P.'S BUDGET IS BECAUSE OF A LITTLE BIT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY OF HOW MANY AGENTS WHERE THEY WERE THEY BE LOCATED. SINCE THE BILL MAKES THE C. H. P. RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS TASK FORCE AND FOR IMPLEMENTING IT THIS GIVES EACH BE A FLEXIBILITY THAT IF THEY CAN'TGET. A DOJ AGENT THEY COULD THEN USE THE MONEY FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHP OFFICER AND IF THEY GET IF IF I DO CHANGES AVAILABLE THEY COULD PROVIDE DOJ WITHOUT MONEY AS REIMBURSEMENT SO IT'S FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF POSITIONS. ON THE TASK FORCE -- BUT THE MIX BETWEEN WHETHER IT'S A C. H. P. POSITION OR DOJ POSITION ON THE TASK FORCE THAT'S WHY WE WANT THAT THE FLEXIBILITY THERE. ARE STAFF REPORT MAKES NOTE OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE UP NEXT YEAR. ON THE SUNSET SO THAT'S ADDS OF YET ANOTHER LITTLE WRINKLE TO THIS MATTER CENTER OF MONEY. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANT TO START BY. THINKING COMMISSIONER STANLEY FOR BEING HERE AND ALSO. TO THESE EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES TO ALL OF YOUR OFFICERS AND STAFF I WILL ON THE LOSS OF SERGEANT LIKE KERN. THE RETAIL THEFT ISSUE SO PART OF PROP FORTY SEVEN REDUCES. SOME CHARGING A SORTIE FOR SHOPLIFTING NOT TO INCLUDE BURGLARY. THEFT CHARGES IF IT'S UNDER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS BUT YOU'RE FOCUSED. ON ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT WERE CLEARLY THE AMOUNT IS. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IT'S IT'S THIS IS ORGANIZED CRIME IS DOING MASSIVE THEFTS. YES IN IN THE IN THE THE ONE CASE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER A TASK FORCE THAT WE WORK WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DA IN SAN FRANCISCO PD. AND US POSTAL SERVICE THAT. PRIMARY WAS OVER NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT THEY'RE STILL IN GOOD STEAD A GOTTEN. I KNOW IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT WE'VE HAD. MOLD ON THEFTS OF APPLE STORES IN YES BROAD DAYLIGHT. IN ALSO OF HIGH END MERCHANDISE. BREAKING WINDOWS AND MOVING OUT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE BUT THEN THEY SHOW UP ON THE INTERNET AS YOU SUGGESTED. ONE MOVE STUFF INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY WERE SELLING IT ON THE INTERNET IN THAT THE THAT LED TO THE DETECTION AND THE ARREST. WHEN THEY GO ON THE INTERNET IS THAT MOVED INTO A FEDERAL CRIME -- YOU KNOW JUST FBI OUR FEDERAL RESOURCES GET INVOLVED. BASED ON HOW THEY'RE MOVING THE MERCHANDISE THAT I I I DON'T KNOW A SPECIFICALLY BUT I WITHIN AT THE AT THE ABBEY GET INVOLVED BUT HOWEVER BEAD. YOU'RE RIGHT ON ONE ASPECT THEY DO SELL THE GOODS ON WEBSITES LIKE EBAY. CORUM FOR CRAIGSLIST TAMPA BIGGEST SEPARATE SELF FOR PEOPLE BEEN ON IN ANY MENTION POSTAL SERVICE WHICH IS FEDERAL.

AND THAT'S WHERE THE US POSTAL SERVICE. THAT'S THE FEDERAL PART OF IT THAT THEY GET INVOLVED IN. AGAIN I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS RECOMMENDATION I'M JUST THIS IS A NEW ON JUST AS WE'RE DEALING WITH A NEW LEVEL OF FIRES WERE DEALING WITH A NEW LEVEL OF KIND OF ORGANIZED CRIME. HE'S HITTING RETAIL LEVEL AND IT'S PUTTING. SHOPPERS AT RISK IT'S PUTTING YOUR OFFICERS AT RISK IF THERE'S CHASES INVOLVED WITH IT -- AND AGAIN.

THE THIEVES COME IN AND JUST CUT THE TETHERS AND GRABBED THE I AM THE MERCHANDISE THE NEW. IS THERE ANY. OUTREACH TO RETAILERS HOW THEY CAN. BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THOSE OR IS IT JUST. SUCH A RARE PHENOMENON THAT IT WOULDN'T -- WARRANT A BROADER RETAIL AVERAGE. I KNOW WITH THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD OUR REGION IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE THAT WE WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO. THAT TASK FORCE THAT WE HAVE BE REACHED OUT TO RETAILERS IN IN THAT AREA SAN FRANCISCO WERE THIS WAS HAPPENING.
