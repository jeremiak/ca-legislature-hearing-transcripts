00:07:38.024 --> 00:07:40.827
BUDGET. THOSE NEXT STEPS TO BE

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:42.428
PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.664
PLAN. THE ADMINISTRATION IS

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.199
CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.968
ADDRESS HOW PGD GOES FORWARD

00:07:49.035 --> 00:07:50.703
AND THE PUBLIC A CALIFORNIA

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:52.905
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.106
ALSO INVESTIGATING THE

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:56.642
POWERSHOT OFFS. THOSE OUTCOMES

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.045
ALSO MUST BE CONSIDERED PART OF

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:01.581
A COMPREHENSIVE ACTION PLAN. A

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.015
FEW OVERALL POINTS ARE HOPEFUL

00:08:03.082 --> 00:08:06.018
GODDESS IN OUR APPROACH. ENERGY

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.820
MUST REMAIN AVAILABLE WITH

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:09.922
MINIMAL TARGETED DISRUPTION

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:12.658
DURING EMERGENCIES. BACKSLIDING

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.193
ON OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.661
CHANGE MAKES WILD FIRE

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.663
CONDITIONS WORSE AND COST

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.566
REPAIRS MORE. TAXPAYERS SHOULD

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:21.968
NOT BE ON THE HOOK FOR BAILING

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.637
OUT SHAREHOLDERS WHO HAVE

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:25.104
PROFITED FROM UTILITY

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.841
INVESTMENTS. UTILITIES PLANS

00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:29.275
FOR HARDENING THEIR

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:30.543
INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE FIRES

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.511
MUST INCLUDE A REALISTIC TIME

00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:34.680
LINE A WORK SCHEDULE THE PUBLIC

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:37.817
CAN SEE AND DEPEND UPON. AND

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:38.918
REAL ACCOUNTABILITY IF GOALS

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.120
ARE NOT MET. WE MUST ALSO

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:43.556
RECOGNIZE WILDFIRES ARE ALSO

00:08:43.623 --> 00:08:44.590
STARTED BY SOURCES OTHER THAN

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.260
UTILITY EQUIPMENT. LIGHTNING

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:48.995
CAR ENGINES DRAGGING CHANGE AND

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.964
SO ON ONE MAN WAS ARRESTED

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.467
RECENTLY AFTER FLYING HERE FROM

00:08:54.533 --> 00:08:57.003
MISSOURI JUST TO START FIRES.

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.504
OUR PREPARATIONS NEED TO TAKE

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.206
THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.974
WHY MOVING FORWARD ON IMPROVING

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.176
FIRE CONDITIONS BY COMBAT IN

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:04.710
CLIMATE CHANGE REMAINS SO

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:07.713
IMPORTANT. THERE ARE ALSO MANY

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.982
QUESTIONS THAT THE WORK OF I'D

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.217
DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:13.619
ACTION PLAN CAN HELP ANSWER.

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.321
ARE THERE WAYS TO JUMPSTART THE

00:09:15.388 --> 00:09:16.756
HARDENING PROCESS SO MORE

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.524
PEOPLE ARE SPARED SHUT OFF

00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.827
FASTER WITHOUT TAXPAYERS ARE

00:09:21.894 --> 00:09:22.461
UTILITY CUSTOMERS BEING LEFT ON

00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:25.364
THE HOOK. HOW CAN WE IMPROVE

00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:27.166
COMMUNICATION FOR EVACUATIONS

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.234
AND OTHER EMERGENCY

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:30.002
NOTIFICATIONS AND FIND

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.938
SOLUTIONS TO CELL TOWERS

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.206
FAILING AT A TIME WHEN THE

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:35.741
PUBLIC IS RELYING ON THEM THE

00:09:35.808 --> 00:09:38.477
MOST. HOW CAN WE BEST DEPLOYS

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:40.279
STATE ASSETS SUCH AS COUNTY

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:42.081
FAIRGROUNDS FOR USE IN

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:44.383
EMERGENCIES WITH RESOURCES LIKE

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.719
WIFI AND CHARGING STATIONS THAT

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.088
CAN BE ON SITE. IN A STATE

00:09:49.155 --> 00:09:51.357
ALREADY SHORT OF HOUSING HOW DO

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:52.792
WE ADDRESS INSURANCE AND

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.627
BUILDING ISSUES NOW THAT WILD

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:56.195
FIRES OWNS HAVE EXPANDED TO

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.130
INCLUDE BOTH RURAL AND URBAN

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:01.634
COMMUNITIES. HOW DO WE ENSURE

00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:02.735
THAT BUSINESSES BUSINESS

00:10:02.802 --> 00:10:04.503

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:40.406
TRANSPARENT MANNER.

00:10:40.473 --> 00:10:41.907
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO KNOW

HAD- AN ISSUE WITH THE

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.741
UTILITIES WHEN I WAS THE

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:16.876
TREASURER OF THE COUNTY OF

00:11:16.942 --> 00:11:18.210
ORANGE. SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE

00:11:18.277 --> 00:11:20.046
BEEN HERE BEFORE BUT BACK THEN

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:22.281
WE CALL THEM BROWN OUTS IN THE

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:24.016
COUNTY OF ORANGE WENT AHEAD AND

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.185
PAID A LOWER UTILITY RATE. SO

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:27.353
THAT WE CAN TURN OUR

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.888
ELECTRICITY OFF TO PROVIDE

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:30.289
ENOUGH ELECTRICITY FOR

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.291
NEIGHBORS BUT THAT WAS RESULT

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.194
OF. STATE LEGISLATION IT THERE

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.329
WAS THE RESULT OF DEREGULATING-

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.532
THE ELECTRIC MARKET AND WE SAW

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:43.235
THAT- IT- HAD A MAJOR IMPACTED

00:11:43.302 --> 00:11:44.703
PROHIBITED AND NATURAL GAS

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.704
ACQUISITION IN THE FUTURES

00:11:45.771 --> 00:11:47.473
MARKET. AND WE WATCHED

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.041
UTILITIES BE MANIPULATED IN THE

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:51.510
SPOT MARKET- AND THEN WE SAW

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.446
POOR GOVERNOR DAVIS- KIND OF

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:55.648
TURN A PROBLEM INTO A MESS. SO

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:58.050
SACRAMENTO- HAD TO MAKE MASSIVE

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.285
ENERGY LOANS SOUTHERN

00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.886
CALIFORNIA EDISON WAS

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:01.821
DOWNGRADED P. JEANNIE FILED FOR

CHAPTER ELEVEN THE FIRST TIME.

00:12:04.023 --> 00:12:05.658
AND WITHIN A FEW WEEKS WE'VE WE

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:06.926
LOST GOVERNOR DAVIS TO THE

00:12:06.992 --> 00:12:07.760
SECOND RECALL OF THE SITTING

00:12:07.827 --> 00:12:09.562
GOVERNOR IN U. S. HISTORY SO

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.497
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE THIS IS

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:12.865
SOMETHING THAT. KINDA

00:12:12.932 --> 00:12:14.733
REVERBERATES WITH ME BECAUSE I

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.001
WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND IN

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:17.269
THAT COMMOTION I EVEN FOUND

00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:18.571
MYSELF BEING THE CHAIR OF THE

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:19.939

TWO TWO DECADES LATER HERE. WE

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:24.510
HAVE SOME INTERESTING

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:29.548
SIMILARITIES SO WHEN SACRAMENTO.

00:12:29.615 --> 00:12:34.353
SACRAMENTO MAKES DEMANDS. THE

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.920
OF ON THE UTILITIES PERHAPS

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:35.521
THIS TIME IN THE PURSUIT OF

RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION-

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:37.823
SUBSIDIZING ELECT THE ELECTRIC

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.724
CAR INDUSTRY. BUT WE NEED TO

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:39.658
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:40.860
ADDITIONAL LOW DEMANDS THAT

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:42.895
RECHARGING EXACTS. AND WITH NEW

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:45.431
MANDATES THE I. O. U.'S. SEEM

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.032
TO HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

00:12:47.099 --> 00:12:48.734
AND DID NOT FOCUS ON HARDENING

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:50.870
ASSETS FROM PROVING

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:51.337

WE'VE HAD FOR MILLENNIA SO THIS

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.943
IS NOTHING RELATIVELY NEW BUT

00:12:58.010 --> 00:12:59.345
INVERSE CONDEMNATION CERTAINLY

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.813
HAS MADE THE FOCUS A LITTLE

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.015
MORE INTERESTING SAN DIEGO GAS

00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:05.518
ELECTRIC BECAME VERY PROACTIVE-

AYE WILDFIRES OWNS- IN THERE

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.470
ABOUT 90% COMPLETED YES IT

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.304
TAKES A LOT OF MONEY YES IT'S

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.506
EXPENSIVE YES IT TAKES TIME BUT

00:13:27.573 --> 00:13:29.441
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:30.109
YOU'VE GOT TO BE MOVING

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:32.044
FORWARD. BECAUSE IT'S A WHOLE

00:13:32.111 --> 00:13:33.445
LOT CHEAPER AND LESS TO

00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:36.248
STRESSFUL BEEN LOSE LIFE AND

00:13:36.315 --> 00:13:39.818

LIKE TWO AND A HALF MILLION

00:20:54.353 --> 00:20:57.155
PEOPLE WE NEED TO START TALKING

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:57.789
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

00:20:57.856 --> 00:21:01.393
ARE IMPACTED. WHO HAVE TO STORE

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:01.994
THEIR MEDICINE RETURN ON THEIR

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.096
VIOLATORS. WHO CAN'T GO TO WORK

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.164
BECAUSE THEIR JOB SITE IS SHUT

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:07.265
DOWN AND THEY DON'T GET PAID

00:21:07.332 --> 00:21:08.533
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO STAY HOME

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.402
BECAUSE THEIR KIDS DON'T HAVE A

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:12.104
SCHOOL TO GO TO AND SMALL

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.739
BUSINESSES THAT ARE SHUTTING

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:15.540
DOWN AND POTENTIALLY GOING OUT

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:17.009
OF BUSINESS BECAUSE BEING SHUT

00:21:17.075 --> 00:21:19.645
DOWN FOR A WEEK DOESN'T WORK-

00:21:19.711 --> 00:21:21.980
FOR MOST- BUSINESSES. DON WE

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:24.216
THOUGHT THAT P. GINNY WOULD USE

00:21:24.282 --> 00:21:27.019
A SCALPEL- IN IMPLEMENTING THIS

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.488
PLAN BLACKOUTS- AND INSTEAD P.

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.823
GINNY HAS CHOSEN TO USE A

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.158
SLEDGEHAMMER AND THEN TURN

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.160
AROUND AND ESSENTIALLY TELL THE

00:21:35.227 --> 00:21:37.562
PUBLIC SORRY SUCK IT UP WE'LL

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:40.499
FIX IT IN TEN YEARS- AND WE

00:21:40.565 --> 00:21:43.201
KNOW THAT THIS HAS RESULTED-

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:44.703
NOT TRUST FROM CLIMATE CHANGE

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:46.571
YES CLIMATE CHANGE IS PART OF

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:49.274
IT. BUT THIS IS A UTILITY THAT

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:51.643
FOR DECADES NOW HAS NOT

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.745
INVESTED APPROPRIATELY AND IT'S

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.647
INFRASTRUCTURE WHILE IT HAS

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:56.748
PAID DIVIDENDS TO ITS

00:21:56.815 --> 00:21:59.151
SHAREHOLDERS- AT A COMPANY THAT

00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:01.520
HAS SIMPLY BEEN BEYOND THAT

00:22:01.586 --> 00:22:02.587
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE IN THE WAY

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.723
THAT IT HAS MAINTAINED AND

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.625
OPERATED AT SYSTEM AND SO WE

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:10.195
NOW HAVE WILD FIRES- ON A SCALE

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:12.931
THAT UNIMAGINABLE AND BLACKOUTS

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.399
ON A SCALE UNIMAGINABLE IN

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:16.368
CALIFORNIA. THE FIFTH LARGEST

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:18.203
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WHERE IT

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.205
APPEARS THAT WE CAN NO LONGER

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:22.441
EVEN KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AND

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:25.577
THAT IS BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE- I

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.146
ALSO BECAUSE I AM IN P. JEANNIE

00:22:28.213 --> 00:22:30.115
TERRITORY I GET ALL THE EMAILS-

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.617
IMPLORING ME AND OTHERS TO GO

00:22:32.684 --> 00:22:34.486
OUT AND PURCHASE DIESEL

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.488
GENERATORS US BECAUSE SINCE P.

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.290
GINNY CAN'T KEEP THE LIGHTS ON.

00:22:38.356 --> 00:22:39.458
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BUY DIESEL

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:42.360
GENERATORS- WHICH POLLUTE-

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:44.262
WHICH CAUSE FIRES AND WHICH

00:22:44.329 --> 00:22:46.031
BECAUSE CARBON MONOXIDE

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:48.800
POISONING AT THE SAME TIME. BUT

00:22:48.867 --> 00:22:50.569
ALL THIS IS HAPPENING RPG ANY

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:04.850
SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:11.656
GENERATE. OUR OWN POWER AND

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.657
STORE IT AND THEN HAVE BACKUP

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:13.892
POWER THAT IS NOT POLLUTING AND

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:14.426
CAUSING FIRES AND CAUSING

00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:16.328
CARBON MONOXIDE. POISONING AND

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:16.928
AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW PGA ANY

CALIFORNIANS TO OBTAIN ENERGY

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:27.739

00:23:27.806 --> 00:23:29.975
ADVOCATING AGAINST EXPANDING

00:23:30.041 --> 00:23:32.377

OWNED UTILITY WE NEED

00:23:38.617 --> 00:23:40.652
FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL CHANGE

00:23:40.719 --> 00:23:42.521
AT PGA ANY BECAUSE THE STATUS

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.723

EVERY DAY. OR TURN THE GAS BACK

00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.555

OUR BACKYARDS IN IN THE

00:24:30.535 --> 00:24:32.671
COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT.

00:24:32.737 --> 00:24:34.139
AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE NORTH

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.740

00:24:35.807 --> 00:24:39.344
TIRED. THEIR SUFFERING THEY

NEED ASSISTANCE. NOT JUST FROM

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:44.583
THE DESTRUCTIVE FIRES BUT BY

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:46.952
THESE THE BUCKLES OF POWER

00:24:47.018 --> 00:24:49.254
OUTAGES IT IS BEEN CHRIS BECOME

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:50.689
CRYSTAL CLEAR TO ME THAT P.

00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.290
JEANNIE LACKS THE BASIC

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:54.392
FUNDAMENTALS TO SUCCESSFULLY

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:55.994
EXECUTE SUCH A LARGE AND

00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:57.996
COMPLEX OUT EACH LET ALONE

00:24:58.063 --> 00:25:00.198
MULTIPLE OUTAGES. THERE ARE

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:02.701
SOME COMMUNITIES ON THE NORTH

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:03.301
COAST THAT DID NOT HAVE POWER

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:05.437
FOR ELEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS. MOST

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:07.005
COMMUNITIES IN OCTOBER DID NOT

00:25:07.072 --> 00:25:07.472
HAVE POWER IN NORTHERN

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.508
MINISTERIAL. I TWO NOMINEES

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:12.677
ZENO NORTON CINEMA AS WELL AS

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.546
LAKE COUNTY FOR SEVEN STRAIGHT

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:17.249
DAYS TRY TO BE A OPERATE YOUR

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:17.816
SMALL BUSINESS. BUT WITHOUT

00:25:17.883 --> 00:25:20.819
POWER. HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.187
HAVE BEEN LOST IN COMMERCE.

00:25:22.254 --> 00:25:24.623
HOSPITALS ARE PUT ON DIVERT

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:26.591
SAINT JOSEPH HOSPITAL IN.

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.693
DOUBLE COUNTY HAD TO CANCEL

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.928
SURGERIES FOR THE GREATER PART

00:25:29.995 --> 00:25:32.497
OF A WORK WEEK DAYS AND DAYS OF

00:25:32.564 --> 00:25:35.300
SCHOOL HAVE BEEN CLOSED WITH

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:35.901
LITTLE TO NO CHANCE BE TO MAKE

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.936
HIM UP. I THINK THERE ARE THREE

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:40.472
REASONS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY.

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:41.773
OVER ONE THE LACK OF INVESTMENT

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.575
IN CANDIDLY DECADES OF

00:25:43.642 --> 00:25:44.709
MISMANAGEMENT BY PACIFIC GAS

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:46.645
ELECTRIC. PUTTING THEIR

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:47.145
SHAREHOLDERS ABOVE THEIR

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:50.548
CUSTOMERS. NUMBER TWO THE LACK

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:52.284
OF SUPERVISION ENFORCEMENT THE

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:53.351
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

00:25:53.418 --> 00:25:55.520
COMMISSION. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.888
FOR OVERSEEING P. GENIES PLANS

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:57.422
FOR THESE PUBLIC SHUT OFF

00:25:57.489 --> 00:25:59.090
EVENTS. THEY ALSO HOLD

00:25:59.157 --> 00:26:02.427
RESPONSIBILITY. PASSIVELY THAT

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.529
WE'RE FACING A NEW CLIMATE

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:06.431
REALITY WHICH IS CAUGHT UP WITH

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:07.999
P. JEANNIE THANK OUR USER OWN

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:11.403
STATISTIC BACK IN 20001215% OF

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:12.637
THEIR LINES WERE AN ELEVATED

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:15.240
FIRE RISK ZONES TODAY. IT'S 50%

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:18.176
OF ALL LINES. WE CANNOT

00:26:18.243 --> 00:26:19.878
CONTINUE WHAT SOME CALL THE NEW

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:22.714
NORMAL WITH POWER SHUT OFF. WE

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.616
NEED TO BE A EXPERT I GREAT

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:25.216
HARDENING THAT YOU MANAGEMENT

00:26:25.283 --> 00:26:27.352
AND MODERNIZATION. TEN YEARS

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:29.254
TELLING CUSTOMERS TEN YEARS IS

00:26:29.321 --> 00:26:34.926
SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. WE MUST%

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:36.695
BETTER PINPOINT OUTAGES VERSUS

00:26:36.761 --> 00:26:38.730
TAKING THE NEAT MEAT CLEAVER

00:26:38.797 --> 00:26:39.297
APPROACH THAT HAVE IMPACTED

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:42.033
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. REASON

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.101
WHY HUMBOLDT COUNTY LOST THEIR

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:46.004
POWER- HERE A FEW WEEKS AGO WAS

00:26:46.071 --> 00:26:46.905
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE AN

00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.073
ABILITY TO BE A SWITCH THE

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:49.808
LINES THE MAIN FEEDER LINES

00:26:49.874 --> 00:26:51.409
COMING INTO THE COUNTY AND IT

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:52.277
WASN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE IN FIRE

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:54.612
DANGER. WE NEED TO DEVELOP A

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:55.714
COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:57.916
RESPONSE PLANS ESPECIALLY FOR

00:26:57.983 --> 00:26:59.250
THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:01.119
PINPOINTING CUSTOMERS BASED OFF

00:27:01.186 --> 00:27:03.121
OF THE CARE PROGRAM WITHIN P.

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:04.756
JEANNIE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK AND

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.925
IN FACT RELIEVING TENS OF

00:27:06.992 --> 00:27:07.926
THOUSANDS OF THE MOST MEDICALLY

00:27:07.993 --> 00:27:10.261
FRAGILE IN THEIR TERRITORY. OUT

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:12.931
OF COMMUNICATION HUNDREDS UPON

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:15.367
HUNDREDS OF CELL TOWERS WENT

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:17.936
DOWN DURING THIS LATEST OUTAGE.

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:21.072
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT CHECK IN THE

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:21.573
LATEST FACEBOOK STATUSES

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:24.809
LITERALLY ABOUT LIFE AND DEATH.

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:25.276
AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS

00:27:25.343 --> 00:27:26.311
THOUSANDS BEEN PUT AT RISK

00:27:26.378 --> 00:27:27.012
BECAUSE CELL PHONE TOWERS WENT

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:30.582
DOWN AND I WILL BE CANDID WITHYOU MISTER CHAIR. I WAS TOLD BY

00:27:30.648 --> 00:27:33.118
EXECUTIVES IN JUNE. A TELECOM

00:27:33.184 --> 00:27:34.352
EXECUTIVES IN JUNE THAT THE

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:35.987
WORST CASE SCENARIO WOULD NOT

00:27:36.054 --> 00:27:38.089
HAPPEN. AND UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE

00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.324
SEEN IT HAPPEN OVER THE LAST

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:41.793
MANY WEEKS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.294
HAVE PERFORMANCE METRICS IN

00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:45.630
STATE LAW. TO ENSURE UTILITIES

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:48.233
HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES IF

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:48.867
THEY'RE NOT HITTING THEIR GOALS

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:51.169
AND WRAP IT UP RIGHT HERE. I

00:27:51.236 --> 00:27:52.904

YET DETERMINED HOW THAT MONEY

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.301

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:51.074
BUT ALSO OUR CUSTOMERS ARE

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:51.574
PUBLIC AGENCIES AND OUR

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:54.944
COMMUNITY PARTNERS. ONE LESSON

00:56:55.011 --> 00:56:56.613
THAT WE LEARNED IS THAT WE

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:57.547
SHOULD HAVE EVEN TIGHTER

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.115
OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS WITH OUR

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:02.485
NONPROFIT PARTNERS. THIS IS SO

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.888
THAT THEY CAN DEPLOY RESOURCES

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.856
EVEN MORE RAPIDLY MORE

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:09.259
EFFICIENTLY AND MORE AND MORE

00:57:09.325 --> 00:57:12.095
AND BROADLY TO HELP SUPPORT

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:12.729
THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY POWER

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:17.300
SHUT OFFS. ANOTHER LESSON IS

00:57:17.367 --> 00:57:19.736
WILL THAT WE LEARNED IS THE

00:57:19.803 --> 00:57:20.270
WIDESPREAD NEED FOR BACKUP

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:23.907
GENERATORS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:26.643
PILOT OF SOLAR BATTERY

00:57:26.709 --> 00:57:27.277
GENERATORS FOR MEDICAL BASED ON

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:30.079
CUSTOMERS. AND THIS IS

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:31.748
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY RELY ON

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:34.551
THESE LIFE SUSTAINING DEVICES.

00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:35.952
AND THE INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:38.254
OUR PROGRAM IS VERY POSITIVE

00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:38.855
HOWEVER IT'S QUITE LIMITED IN

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:42.292
SCOPE AT THIS POINT. IT'S CLEAR

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:44.661
THAT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS NOT

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:45.995
JUST THOSE THAT ARE MEDICAL

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.864
BASELINE CUSTOMERS ARE

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:48.364
INTERESTED IN OBTAINING

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:51.968
GENERATORS. AND WE ARE IN EARLY

00:57:52.035 --> 00:57:53.503
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COUNTY

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:55.905
OF SAN DIEGO AS TO HOW WE CAN

00:57:55.972 --> 00:57:59.008
CREATE A BULL GENERATOR PROGRAM.

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:00.610
IN ADDITION WE'RE EXPLORING

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.111
WERE MAKES SENSE FOR US TO

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:04.380
BUILD. MICHAEL GRITS TO KEEP

00:58:04.447 --> 00:58:07.116
OUR KEY COMMUNITY FACILITIES OR

00:58:07.183 --> 00:58:09.752
CORD DOWNTOWN AREAS OPERATING

00:58:09.819 --> 00:58:12.255
DURING POWER SHUT OFF SUCH AS

00:58:12.322 --> 00:58:12.789
WHAT WE DID IN THE TOWN OF

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:16.192
JULIAN. WELL AS THE GENIE

00:58:16.259 --> 00:58:17.994
CONTINUOUSLY INVEST AND

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:20.196
HARDENING ARE INFRASTRUCTURE WE

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:21.865
KNOW THAT OUR WORK TO MITIGATE

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:24.167
WILDFIRE AND THE IMPACT TO OUR

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:27.036
CUSTOMERS IS NEVER DONE. OUR

00:58:27.103 --> 00:58:29.372
GOAL IS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:32.809
THE NEED FOR. POWER SHUT OFF

00:58:32.876 --> 00:58:35.345
THROUGH A STRATEGIC COMBINATION

00:58:35.411 --> 00:58:37.580
AND PORTFOLIO PROJECTS

00:58:37.647 --> 00:58:38.181
INCLUDING STRATEGICALLY UNDER

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:42.852
GROUNDING. INCLUDING THE USE OF

00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:44.387
IT A CONDUCTOR THAT'S COVERED

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:46.890
WITH NON CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS.

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:48.324
INCLUDING ADDING MORE SEXUAL

00:58:48.391 --> 00:58:50.026
ISING DEVICES AND MORE BACK UP

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:53.429
GENERATOR SOLUTIONS. WE'RE ALSO

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:55.198
WORKING TO EXPAND OF FALLING

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:57.800
CONDUCTOR PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY

00:58:57.867 --> 00:59:00.069
THAT WILL PREVENT BROKEN WIRES

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:00.603
FROM BECOMING AN IGNITION

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:04.407
SOURCE. OUR ENGINEERS HAVE

00:59:04.474 --> 00:59:05.942
FIGURED OUT A WAY TO CUT OFF

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:08.811
POWER TO A BROKEN WIRE BEFORE

00:59:08.878 --> 00:59:09.312
IT EVEN HITS THE GROUND

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:12.448
ESSENTIALLY BEING GRAVITY. AND

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.050
THIS WILL DETECT AND SHUT OFF

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:14.651
POWER IN ABOUT ONE SECOND TIME

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:18.488
FRAME. NEXT YEAR WE'RE GOING TO

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:19.856
BE OPENING OF FIRE SCIENCE AND

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:21.791
INNOVATION LAB WHICH WILL BRING

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:24.460
TOGETHER LEADING THINKERS. AND

00:59:24.527 --> 00:59:26.863
PROBLEM SOLVERS N ACADEMIA.

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.464
AND GOVERNMENT. AND THE

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:30.900
COMMUNITY TO CREATE FORWARD

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:32.368
LOOKING SOLUTIONS. THAT WILL

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:35.038
HELP PREVENT IGNITIONS.

00:59:35.104 --> 00:59:37.707
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF FIRES

00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:38.274
AND ULTIMATELY HELP BUILD A

00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:41.177
MORE RESILIENT REGION. AN

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:43.613
ADDITIONAL AREAS WHERE WE NEED

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.148
RELIEF THAT LAND OUTSIDE OF THE

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:46.649
TO LEASE CONTROLS INCLUDE

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:49.585
STANDARDS FOR NEW HOUSING

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.153
DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE HIGH

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:52.989
FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. AND

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:54.657
STREAMLINED CONSTRUCT ABILITY

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:04.500
PROJECT REQUIREMENTS. SO IN

01:00:04.567 --> 01:00:06.602
CLOSING OUR COMMITMENT TO THE

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:08.204
SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.474
WE SERVE IS UNWAVERING. MOVING

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:14.377
FORWARD SB JANIE WILL CONTINUE

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.646
WORKING DILIGENTLY AT THE BROAD

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.614
RANGE OF UTILITY SERVICES

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:19.849
THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE

01:00:19.916 --> 01:00:21.884
WEATHER EVENTS SUCH AS

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:22.352
AGGRESSIVE VEGETATION

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:25.388
MANAGEMENT. WEATHER DATA AND

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.791
EVENT PREDICTABILITY. ALSO

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.059
SHARPENING OUR EMERGENCY

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:31.928
MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:35.264
FINALLY IMPROVING EFFECTIVENESS

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:35.865
AROUND CUSTOMER AND COMMUNITY

01:00:35.932 --> 01:00:39.502
COMMUNICATIONS. I'M CERTAIN

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:40.069
WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW UP TO

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:45.174
IMPROVE. EACH OF THESE AREAS.

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:45.708
BUT I THINK WHAT'S NEED IN

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.111
CALIFORNIA. IS THE THINK BEYOND

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:50.980
OURSELVES. THIS MOMENT IS

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:54.384
CALLING FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.586
PS PS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR

01:00:56.652 --> 01:01:00.323
RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT'S NEXT. I'VE

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.225
SAID AN APP ASPIRATIONAL GOAL

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.994
FOR OUR ORGANIZATION. NOT ONLY

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:07.363
TO REDUCE OR MITIGATE THE

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.964
THREAT OF WILDFIRES BUT HOW DO

01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:11.601
WE ELIMINATED. AND I KNOW THIS

01:01:11.667 --> 01:01:13.669
IS A LOFTY THING TO SAY BUT IT

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:14.203
S. P. JEANNIE. THAT IS OUR

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.639
NORTH STAR. AND WE ABSOLUTELY

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:19.675
ARE WORKING TOWARDS THAT. I

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.611
APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:22.145
ALLOWED ABOUT ME TODAY AND

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.815
WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. I

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.617
JUSTWANT TO ASK YOU MENTIONED

01:01:27.683 --> 01:01:30.153
THERE ARE NO MAJOR FIRES WHERE

01:01:30.219 --> 01:01:31.654
THEIR FIRES YES THERE WERE

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.689
FIRES AND HOW DO YOU DEFINE A

01:01:33.756 --> 01:01:38.661
MAJOR FIRE VERSES OF. OF WHAT

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:39.228
WE TALKING WITH BRUSH FIRES

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:41.030
WILL YEAH- I AM LIKE THERE THAT

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:43.299
CATASTROPHIC FIRES OKAY SO WE

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:45.068
DID HAVE FIRES- WHERE PROP

01:01:45.134 --> 01:01:46.836
PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS LOST

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.705
DIRECT WERE THERE ANY LOSS OF

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.642
LIFE. NO NOT THAT I KNOW. OKAY

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:54.177
DO DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:54.777
TERMS OF MANY STRUCTURES WERE

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.612
AFFECTED BY THE FIRES- THERE

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:59.215
WAS A FIRE IN RAMONA WHICH I

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.349
HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:02.185
CALIFORNIA WHO IS ON THAT VERY

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:05.121
QUICKLY. AND I DON'T RECALL HOW

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.689
MANY STRUCTURES WERE DAMAGE I

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.925
BELIEVE SOME OF IT MAY HAVE

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:09.959
BEEN SOME OUT STRUCTURES LIKE

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.894
BARNES AND- THINGS OF THAT

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.896
NATURE THERE'S ANOTHER FIRE

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.431
VALLEY CENTER DURING THAT TIME

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.733
FRAME. HAS A BUTTON TO DO AS A

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.669
BEEN DETERMINE WHAT THE CAUSE

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:20.903
OF THOSE FIRES WAS. NOT TO MY

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:26.676
KNOWLEDGE OKAY- CENTER SKINNER.

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.277
THANK YOU- SO YOU INDICATED

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:31.114
THAT YOUR- AVERAGE POWER SHUT

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:32.215
OFF TIME WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:02:32.281 --> 01:02:36.586
AND WE KNOW THAT IN THE DE.

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.421
REGION THAT MIGHT BY ARE YOU

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:42.258
SERVICE IT WAS LONGER. AND

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.595
THERE WERE- AS FAR AS I KNOW

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:47.997
FROM LOOKING AT THE- WINDS DATA

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:51.734
HERE THE WIND- THE HIGH WIND

01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:55.505
SPEEDS DID LAST LONGER IN THE

01:02:55.571 --> 01:02:58.241
IN SME OF P. GENIES UTILITY

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:01.043
AREA SO THAT MIGHT. EXPLAIN A

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.746
LITTLE BIT FOR THE DIFFERENCE

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.916
IN TIME BUT COULD YOU JUST ASK

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.417
LEVERETT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON

01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:11.954
HOW YOU WERE ABLE TO CHIEF A

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:13.589
WITH THERE WERE OTHER FACTORS

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.358
BESIDES WIND SPEED THAT ALLOWED

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:18.060
YOU TO ACHIEVE A SHORTER

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.428
DURATION OF AN OUTAGE AND

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:22.798
ADDITIONALLY- HOW YOU'RE ABLE

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.967
TO WHAT IT WOULD APPEAR. IS

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:27.537
MORE SURGICAL- IN OTHER WORDS

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.639
LESS CUSTOMERS CLEARLY YOUR

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:30.940
SERVICE AREA IS SMALLER YOU

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:33.276
HAVE LESS CUSTOMERS BUT AS A

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:36.179
PROPORTION YOU STILL TURN THE

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:38.948
POWER OFF OF A PROPORTIONATELY

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:39.682
FEWER SERVE YOU COULD JUST

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.185
ELABORATE A LITTLE ON WHAT

01:03:42.251 --> 01:03:45.087
ENABLED YOU TO DO THAT YOUR- I

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:48.524
ARE YOU. YOU FOR THE QUESTION-

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:49.425
I WOULD FIRST START WITH THE

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.393
LAST PART OF YOUR QUESTION THAT

01:03:50.459 --> 01:03:53.095
IS THAT- SINCE YOU THE

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.697
DEVASTATING FIRES IN TWO

01:03:54.764 --> 01:03:56.465
THOUSAND SEVEN- WE NOT ONLY

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.367
HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON TRYING TO

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:00.169
FORECAST FIRE DANGER. BUT ALSO

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.704
HARDENER INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:02.772
PART OF HARDENING OUR

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:03.806
INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:06.609
DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF THE HOUSE

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:07.243
BUT LOWER VOLTAGE SIDE. WE HAVE

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:10.513
BEEN. A THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.048
INSTALLING SECTION LICENSE

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:14.050
WHICH IS AND WHAT THAT'S ABLE

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:17.119
TO DO IS ONLY LIMIT. UP A SHOT

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.188
OFF TO KIND OF THAT THE MOST

01:04:19.255 --> 01:04:21.224
ENDANGERED COMMUNITIES. SO WE

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:23.326
PAIR ARE SECTION LICENSE WHICH

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:24.927
WITH THE WEATHER STATION

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:25.928
BECAUSE SOMETIMES SOME OF THE

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.030
CIRCUITRY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.166
BACK COUNTRY IS IN OVER A

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.068
HUNDRED CIRCUIT MILES LONG. AND

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:33.336
THAT NGUYEN CONDITION IN ONE

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:35.271
PART OF A CIRCUIT COULD BE VERY

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:36.038
DIFFERENT THAN A WIN CONDITION

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:38.140
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CIRCUIT.

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.675
SO PUTTING MULTIPLE WEATHER

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.410
STATIONS ON A CIRCUIT AND

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:42.478
PAIRING IT WITH THE SEXUAL

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.247
LICENSE WHICH HAS PROVED TO BE

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:46.649
A GOOD PRACTICE FOR US TO BE

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.351
ABLE TO BE MORE SURGICAL AND

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.987
HOW WE- ARE ABLE TO SHUT OFF A

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.456
MORE NARROWLY. WHAT I WOULD SAY

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:55.124
TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION IS THAT

01:04:55.191 --> 01:04:57.560
WHEN IT COMES TO PATROL BEAT TO

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.528
WE DO A 100% PATROLLING OF A

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:00.997
POWER LINE AFTER WE TURN OFF

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.898
THE SERVICE. AND THE REASON

01:05:02.965 --> 01:05:04.333
THAT WE DO THAT IS BECAUSE WE

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.601
CAN FIND DAMAGE TO THAT

01:05:05.668 --> 01:05:07.270
CIRCUITRY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE

01:05:07.336 --> 01:05:09.839
SURE BEFORE WE RE ENERGIZE THAT

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.374
CIRCUIT THAT THERE'S NO DAMAGE

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.242
TO START ANOTHER FIRE. SO WE DO

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:16.112
A 100% PATROLS ON THE CIRCUIT

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:17.680
AND WE DO THAT EITHER BY FOOT

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.416
PATROL OR BY CAR OR BY

01:05:20.483 --> 01:05:21.651
HELICOPTER THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:05:21.717 --> 01:05:22.952
AREAS ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:24.053
ELEVATIONS THAT YOU NEED TO PUT

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.921
A HELICOPTER IN THE AIR. AND

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:29.025
SOMETIMES THE WIND IS STILL TOO

01:05:29.091 --> 01:05:30.760
HIGH FOR US TO GET A HELICOPTER

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.161
IN THE AIR SO THOSE ARE JUST

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:33.996
SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT GO

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:35.298
INTO THE TIME FRAME IT TAKES US

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:37.600
TO PATROL. BUT I CAN TELL YOU

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:39.302
THAT IN SAN DIEGO SERVICE

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:41.570
TERRITORY. THE WINDS WERE OF A

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:42.805

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.988
CHANGE FROM A CULTURE OF%

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:14.323
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON WHICH

01:13:14.389 --> 01:13:17.626
WE'VE BEEN VERY PROUD OF TO

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:20.129
KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. N.

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:20.996
WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:24.099
IT'S NOT A TOP DOWN CULTURE IT

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.268
WELL OURS FROM THE CEO ALL THE

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.836
WAY DOWN TO OUR EMPLOYEES ARE

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:29.471
ALL IN. BUT IT'S ALSO BOTTOMS

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:32.174
UP WE HAVE LONG TERM EMPLOYEES

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:33.976

SO I REALLY FEEL THAT FROM A

01:13:42.351 --> 01:13:43.919
FROM A COMPANY AND A CULTURE

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:45.387
PERSPECTIVE THERE'S NOTHING

01:13:45.454 --> 01:13:47.222
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EMPLOYEE

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.390

GROUNDING AND TO HAVE YOU FOUND

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.238
THOSE TO BE AS EFFECTIVE

01:18:30.305 --> 01:18:30.806
POTENTIALLY ADDS UNDERGROUND

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:33.308
FOR EXAMPLE. I WOULD TELL YOU

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.243
THAT THE ONLY REAL 100% FAIL

01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.379
SAFE WAY TO ELIMINATE THE

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:39.381
THREAT OF WILDFIRES FROM

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:40.949
ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS TO

01:18:41.016 --> 01:18:43.385
UNDERGROUND HAVING SAID THAT-

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.786
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO HARDEN YOUR

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:46.588
LINES WHICH IS REALLY IN OUR

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.523
VERNACULAR TO REPLACE OUR WOULD

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:51.893
POLLS WITH STEEL POLES. PUT IN

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.828
LARGER WIRE AND BIGGER SPACING

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.963
BETWEEN THE WIRES- IF WE'RE

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:56.898
ABLE TO INSTALL THIS FALLING

01:18:56.965 --> 01:18:58.366
CONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.402
ABLE TO EACH SHOT DETECT WHEN A

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:02.370
POWER LINE IS BROKEN AND SHUT

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:03.638
OFF THE POWER TO THE POWER

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.574
LINES THAT THE SECTIONAL ICING

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:07.008
THAT YOU REFERENCE TO KNOW IT'S

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.543
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THERE

01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.146
THAT YEAH IT SAID. THAT IS

01:19:11.213 --> 01:19:13.782
UTILIZED ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:15.250
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.952
BUILDING THAT OUT BUT IT DOES

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:18.553
NEED A HIGH SPEED COMMUNICATION

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.554
NETWORK SO WE HAVE THAT THOUGH

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.990
THAT PLAN IN PARALLEL BUT IF

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.558
YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THE

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.293
HARDENING. AND THE FOLLOWING

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.162
CONDUCTOR TECHNOLOGY AND EVEN

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:29.264
REPLACING SOME OF THE BARE WIRE

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:32.434
WITH COVERED CONDUCTOR- WE DO

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:35.837
THANK YOU CAN INCREASE THE THEY

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:36.404
WIND SPEEDS IN WHICH YOU CAN

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:40.575
WITHSTAND. SO WERE YOU REQUIRED

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:41.877
TO LOOK AT IN IMPLEMENTED BEST

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:43.645
AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:45.046
OR WAS THAT A COLLECTIVE ON

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:47.048
YOUR PART. AT WITH THE THAT WAS

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.350
IT JUST THAT WAS OUR MISSION

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:50.285
AROUND YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE SET

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:52.087
A PLAN THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.588
WOULD NOT BE THE CALLS A LOT A

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:56.258
WILDFIRE. SO IT REALLY IS US

01:19:56.324 --> 01:19:57.392
GETTING TOGETHER IN OUR

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.294
OPERATIONAL GROUPS AND FIGURED

01:19:59.361 --> 01:19:59.861
OUT WHAT ARE THE NEW

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.863
TECHNOLOGIES WEEK WE CAN USE

01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:03.165
ONE OF THE OPERATING PRACTICES

01:20:03.231 --> 01:20:05.033
THAT WE CAN USE. AND HOW DO YOU

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.935
REALLY COMBINE THESE IN LAYER

01:20:07.002 --> 01:20:09.104
THESE SO THAT WE'RE ABLE TO CAN

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.072
WITHSTAND HIGHER AMOUNTS OF

01:20:11.139 --> 01:20:13.308
WIND WIND SPEEDS. BUT DO YOU

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:16.611
CONSIDER THE SECTIONAL RISING

01:20:16.678 --> 01:20:17.212
THAT YOU DESCRIBED OF FOR THE

01:20:17.279 --> 01:20:20.882
POWER SHUT OFF. THAT WAS ONE OF

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:21.416
YOUR HARDENING ABSOLUTELY

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:25.453
HELLO. IN THESE INDIVIDUAL THE-

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.888
WOULD POLLS REPLACING WITH

01:20:26.955 --> 01:20:29.224
STEEL THE SECTIONAL RISING AND

01:20:29.291 --> 01:20:31.059
THE OTHER LINE TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:34.329
YOU DESCRIBED. ARE THEY- LESS

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:37.732
EXPENSIVE PER UNIT I SUPPOSE I

01:20:37.799 --> 01:20:38.633
DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER WORD TO

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.535
USE THAN SAY THE UNDER

01:20:40.602 --> 01:20:42.103
GROUNDING THE ANSWER IS YES.

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.172
AND SO. WHAT WE'RE THINKING

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:46.074
ABOUT NOW IS NOT ONLY DOING

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.943
THOSE PORTFOLIO PROJECTS THAT

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.077
I'M TALKING ABOUT. AND

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.812
STRATEGICALLY UNDERGROUND A

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:52.781
WHERE IT MAKES SENSE BUT ALSO

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:54.216
THE USE A BACKUP GENERATORS

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.284
COULD BE A GREAT WAY TO IT IT

01:20:56.351 --> 01:20:57.652
MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO

01:20:57.719 --> 01:21:00.555
CONSUMERS. SO YOU'LL SEE US DO

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:01.356
OUR PORTFOLIO THE PROJECTS

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.592
INCLUDING BACKUP GENERATORS BUT

01:21:03.658 --> 01:21:06.528
JUST FINALLY THE YOU ALL THAT

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:09.197
WAS DONE IN EFFECT ON YOUR OWN.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:13.301
SELECTIVELY VERSUS BY ANY KIND

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:13.868
OF DIRECTION YEAH WE WEREN'T

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:16.705
MANDATED SO. THANK YOU VERY

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:22.377
MUCH. WE HAD- CENTER CHIANG IN

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:25.380
THE CENTER STERN. THANK YOU SO

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:25.947
AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDER

01:21:26.014 --> 01:21:27.148
GROUNDING INFRASTRUCTURE AYE I

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.351
THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:29.884
FUTURE CATASTROPHES LIKE

01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:33.822
EARTHQUAKES SO WOULD-

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:34.322
UNDERGROUND IN WITH THAT

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.891
WITHSTAND EARTHQUAKES. YES I

01:21:36.958 --> 01:21:37.459
BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD THAT

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:40.328
WOULD WITHSTAND. IT DEPENDS ON

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.763
OBVIOUSLY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.565
EARTH EARTHQUAKE BUT BUT YES IT

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.101
IT IS A IT WOULD BE A LA

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.769
TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD ALLOW US

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:50.105
TO WITHSTAND MORE ENVIRONMENTAL.

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:54.276
CONDITIONS THANK YOU. CENTER

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:55.710
MORE LUCK THANK YOU MISTER

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:58.480
CHAIR- MISS WHEN YOU'RE FALLING

01:21:58.546 --> 01:22:00.515
LINE TECHNOLOGY SOUNDS SIMILAR

01:22:00.582 --> 01:22:01.483
TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:03.618
AUSTRALIA- THEY CALL IT POWER

01:22:03.685 --> 01:22:05.654
DIVERT ERRORS OR A RAPID BIRTH

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.289
FAULT CURRENT LIMITER SINCE

01:22:07.355 --> 01:22:09.491
THIS IS THE SAME TECHNOLOGY

01:22:09.557 --> 01:22:11.626
IT'S A SIMILAR TECHNOLOGY LA

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:13.862
JOHN FEEL THAT THAT QUESTION.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.597
THE IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:18.600
AND THAT'S- BROUGHT PROVIDING A

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:21.636
WAY TO. I'D EXTRA SINCE THE

01:22:21.703 --> 01:22:22.170
PROTECTION FOR YOUR SYSTEM

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:23.071
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND SO

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.307
WE HAVE A VERSION OF THAT IN

01:22:25.373 --> 01:22:27.275
OUR SERVICE TERRITORY WHERE

01:22:27.342 --> 01:22:27.776
WHEN WE GET INTO THESE

01:22:27.842 --> 01:22:30.145
SITUATIONS WE ENABLE ALL OF OUR

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:32.514
SMART DEVICES ON OUR SYSTEM. TO

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.748
GO INTO HYPERSENSITIVE

01:22:33.815 --> 01:22:35.350
PROTECTED MODE IF YOU WILL AND

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:37.218
ACTED THE FASTEST POSSIBLE WAY

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.320
TO LIMIT THE AMOUNTOF ENERGY

01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:40.188
THAT CAN BE DISSIPATED- WHEN AN

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:41.890
EVENT OCCURS ON THE SYSTEM SO

01:22:41.956 --> 01:22:43.792
THAT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:44.426
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FROM

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.226
FROM AUSTRALIA THE FALLING

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.162
CONDUCTOR IS MORE. A CONDUCTOR

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.797
BREAKS IN THE AIR AND WE DE

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.131
ENERGIZED BEFORE IT HITS THE

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.633
GROUND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:52.967
DIFFERENT. BUT THE SENSITIVE

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.302
PROTECTION AND I DESCRIBES MORE

01:22:54.369 --> 01:22:55.570
SIMILAR TO A TO WHAT THE REASON

01:22:55.637 --> 01:22:57.872
IN AUSTRALIA AND DOING OTHER

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:58.907
INDEPENDENT RESEARCH I SEE THAT

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:01.476
OVERHEAD LINES ARE IMPROVING-

01:23:01.543 --> 01:23:02.577
WHAT KIND OF OUR PEACE IF YOU

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.013
PUT OUT TO IMPROVE JUST. THE

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.916
LINES. ON A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:10.018
BASIS WHAT WHAT ONE OF THE

01:23:10.085 --> 01:23:10.819
THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING WE'VE

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.020
BEEN WORKING WITH- THREE

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.588
DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS BIG FOR

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.090
US WE ALSO ON OUR LINES TO STAY

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:16.024
IN THE YEAR ONE AND WITHSTAND

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:17.926
HIGH WINDS ONE LISTING CONTACT

01:23:17.992 --> 01:23:20.195
FROM FLYING DEBRIS- TREE LIMBS.

01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:21.463
US WE WERE WE WORK WITH THREE

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:22.931
MANUFACTURERS TO PROVIDE A

01:23:22.997 --> 01:23:24.632
COVER CONDUCTOR THAT HAS TO

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.401
STEAL STRANDS IN THE MIDDLE TO

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.136
PROVIDE THE EXTRA STRENGTH- AND

01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.738
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO FROM A

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:31.740
CONDUCTOR THE HOUSE TWENTY

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:32.374
SEVEN HUNDRED POUNDS OF TINSEL

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:33.441
STRENGTH THE FORTY FOUR

01:23:33.508 --> 01:23:34.909
HUNDRED- SO THAT'S WHEN THE

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:36.111
AREAS WERE WORKING WITH

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.746
MANUFACTURERS TO HELP. INNOVATE

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.047
AND IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.282
THEIR- MEN LAST QUESTION IS

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:43.852
WHEN WILL TWENTY A- WHICH-

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.920
ALLOWS FOR BEAUTIFICATION SOME

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:48.723
UNDER GROUNDING. A BY- THE LAST

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.458
NUMBERS I HEAR FROM THE CPUC.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:53.294
OR FROM DECEMBER OF FIFTEEN YOU

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:54.229
HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.664
MILLION IN RESERVES TO USE

01:23:56.731 --> 01:23:58.666
THROUGHOUT YOUR IN YOUR AREA.

01:23:58.733 --> 01:24:00.535
HOUSE HOUSE HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:06.141
AS REGARDS TO TRYING. TO

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:06.708
BEAUTIFY ONE TO GET SOME OF

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:12.647
THESE. WILD FIRES OWN LINES

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.815
UNDERGROUND. YES PROBABLY OVER

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:14.382
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE

01:24:14.449 --> 01:24:15.016
BEEN. WHEN THE TWENTY ETS ARE

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:15.417
REALLY THE CITY'S

01:24:15.483 --> 01:24:15.984
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE.

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:16.518
WHICH LINES THEY WANT TO

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:18.119
UNDERGROUND. SO WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.821
DOING IS WORKING WITH THEM AND

01:24:19.888 --> 01:24:22.590
TALKING TO THEM ABOUT. WHERE

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.459
THE RISKIEST AREAS IN THE IS

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:26.261
CITY OR COUNTY WHERE YOU WOULD

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.263
YOU CAN UTILIZE THOSE FUNDS SO

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:30.231
THE CONVERSATION HAS TURNED A

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.933
LITTLE BIT AND THEY'RE ASKING

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.067
FOR FEEDBACK AND WE WANT TO

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:34.769
GIVE THAT FEEDBACK BECAUSE-

01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:35.937
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO KEEP OUR

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:37.872
COMMUNITY SAFE. THANK YOU THANK

01:24:37.939 --> 01:24:39.441
YOU FOR BEING A MODEL AS WELL

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:41.709
BEING- LOOKING AT SOMETHING FOR

01:24:41.776 --> 01:24:42.977
MOST SEVEN AND MOVING FORWARD

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:44.245
SO I JUST WANT TO. COMMEND YOU

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:46.214
ON THAT SENATOR WILL DID YOU

01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:47.982
HAVE ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:49.017
I DID DâN THANK YOU MISTER

01:24:49.083 --> 01:24:49.851
CHAIR FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE

EVERYBODY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:55.924
SIT ON THE UTILITIES COMMITTEE-

01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:58.226
BUT I. I HAD A QUESTION- TERMS

01:24:58.293 --> 01:25:00.094
A MICRO YOUR TALK ABOUT MICRO

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.563
GRANTS I DON'T SIT ON THIS

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:02.564
COMMITTEE AND I SURE WINNER

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:03.798

01:27:43.958 --> 01:27:45.660
DATABASES AND INFORMATION WHERE

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:47.528

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:21.462
REALLY TO BUILD BUILD

01:28:21.529 --> 01:28:23.197

FIRST TWO QUESTIONS ABOUT- YOU

01:54:35.935 --> 01:54:37.904
HOPEFULLY THE SAME THING THAT I

01:54:37.971 --> 01:54:39.372
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT OVERHEAD

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:40.273
LINES AND YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN.

01:54:40.340 --> 01:54:43.876
COVERING THE LINE SO I WANTED

MILLION RESERVISTS DO

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.323

FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT ONE

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:12.939
I THINK THAT'S A- SOME OF THOSE

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:14.407
FUNDS ARE OBVIOUSLY ALLOCATED

01:55:14.474 --> 01:55:16.075

BEAUTIFICATION AN ASCETIC

01:55:19.712 --> 01:55:21.948
PURPOSES I THINK THIS IS

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.016
SOMETHING WE ARE WORKING

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:25.918
THROUGH- UNDER GROUNDING HE IS

01:55:25.985 --> 01:55:28.087
A SOLUTION ONE OF MANY ANSWERS

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:29.122
FRANKLY SOME TRADE OFFS

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.390
ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERGROUND

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:32.725
AND- RESTORATION TIME IS ONE OF

01:55:32.792 --> 01:55:34.861
THEM- TIME TO INSTALL THAT

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:36.796
TECHNOLOGY IS ANOTHER- TALKING

01:55:36.863 --> 01:55:37.797
ON THE FIRST POINT OUT WHEN YOU

01:55:37.864 --> 01:55:39.299
HAVE A FAULT IN AN UNDERGROUND

01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:40.767
LINE IT CAN TAKE SOME TIME TO

01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.235
TROUBLESHOOT THAT. WE NEED A

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:44.070
MUCH LONGER OUTAGES- THERE

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:46.005
THERE ARE RESILIENCY ISSUES

01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:48.174
ASSOCIATED WITH A CERTAIN

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:49.342
EVENTS THAT CAN AFFECT UNDER

IMPACTING OUR OVERGROUND

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.379
EQUIPMENT OR ABOVE GROUND

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:55.715
EQUIPMENT SAME WAY- PERMITTING

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:58.084
CAN TAKE SOME TIME AND AGAIN-

01:55:58.151 --> 01:55:59.252
IT TAKES MUCH LONGER TO

01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:01.087
CONSTRUCT. AND AGAIN THIS ISN'T

01:56:01.154 --> 01:56:02.221
SOLELY ACOSTA ISSUE THE COST IS

01:56:02.288 --> 01:56:04.557
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE- IT'S AROUND

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:05.758
EIGHT TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:56:05.825 --> 01:56:06.859
EVEN OUR COVER CONDUCTOR

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:09.462
OVERHEAD SOLUTION IS- BUT THAT

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:10.930
IS PART OF OUR ARSENAL THE LAST

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:12.365
WEEK WE DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE

01:56:12.432 --> 01:56:14.200
PLACES WHERE UNDERGROUND IS THE

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:15.768
BEST SOLUTION. THE WAY WE'RE

01:56:15.835 --> 01:56:18.137
APPROACHING THIS IS A VERY I

01:56:18.204 --> 01:56:20.206
CAN USE OR GRANULAR AGAIN A

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:21.874
GRANULAR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OUR

01:56:21.941 --> 01:56:22.942
SYSTEM THAT LOOKS AT THE

01:56:23.009 --> 01:56:24.243
CONSEQUENCES A POTENTIAL

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:27.046
IGNITIONS AND WE FOCUS ON THOSE

01:56:27.113 --> 01:56:28.614
THAT THERE WILL BE AREAS THAT

01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:31.217
MAY BE- ARE SO CONSEQUENCE ON

01:56:31.284 --> 01:56:32.018
THE END OF A WILDFIRE THAT

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.619
UNDERGROUND IS THE BEST

01:56:33.686 --> 01:56:35.021
SOLUTION. AND WILL USE THAT

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:37.323
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THE CASE SO

01:56:37.390 --> 01:56:38.858
YOU'RE NOT THE CEO OF EDISON SO

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:40.259
WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU BECAUSE

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.561
YOU'RE STILL A SENIOR VICE

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:44.931
PRESIDENT- YOU- ARE ONE OF

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:47.867
THREE. I USE INVESTOR OWNED

01:56:47.934 --> 01:56:56.008
UTILITIES IN THE STATE. SO YOU

01:56:56.075 --> 01:57:00.413
SOMEWHERE IN HISTORY YOU GRANT.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:01.381
FRENCH I ZERO ZONE OF THE

01:57:01.447 --> 01:57:03.082
STATE- AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:04.016
THEN- IF YOU'RE CHARTER BY THE

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:04.784
STATE IN A SCENE BY THE STATE.

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.018
CAN YOUR CHARTER BE REVOKED IN

01:57:06.085 --> 01:57:08.121
CAN THE STATE. IN A SENSE

01:57:08.187 --> 01:57:09.155
NATIONALIZE YOUR UTILITY IF I

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:09.956
COULD USE THAT TERM TO SAY OKAY

01:57:10.022 --> 01:57:11.557
WHAT WE'RE TAKING OVER WE DON'T

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:13.126

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:13.926
WE'RE GONNA DO IT OURSELVES YOU

01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:16.162
HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS.

01:57:16.229 --> 01:57:17.029
SENATOR THAT ONE'S DEFINITELY

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.932
OUT OF MY DEPTH SO- BUT- WHAT I

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:21.334
COULD SHARE WITH YOU THOUGH-

01:57:21.401 --> 01:57:22.668
AND IF THIS DOESN'T COME

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:24.337
THROUGH THE TALKING POINTS.

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:26.873
MAYBE WILL FURTHER INTO AN A- I

01:57:26.939 --> 01:57:28.574
THINK AS YOU LOOK AT THE I USE

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:29.809
I CAN REALLY ONLY SPEAK FOR US

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:30.376
CALLOUS AND THAT'S WHERE I

01:57:30.443 --> 01:57:33.246
WORK- WE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:57:33.312 --> 01:57:34.514
INNOVATION AND WE'RE COMMITTED

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.849
TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES- MANY

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:37.550
THINGS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN

01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:39.352
TERMS OF OUR APPROACH INCOME A

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.086
CONDUCTOR BUT MAYBE THE NEW

01:57:40.153 --> 01:57:42.889
TECHNOLOGIES- HAVEN'T HAD A

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:43.956
CHANCE TO SPEAK ON SOMETHING

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:45.258
WHERE WE'VE DEVELOPED. OF THE

01:57:45.324 --> 01:57:46.993
ABILITIES ARE SMART METERS TO

01:57:47.059 --> 01:57:49.028
DETECT WHEN A WIRES DOWN SALAS

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:50.663
SMART METERS WE DEPLOYED- OVER

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:52.331
THE YEARS- WE CAN USE

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:53.666
INFORMATION COMING FROM THOSE

01:57:53.733 --> 01:57:55.802
DEVICES TO PROTECT AND

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:56.602
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LINE IS ON

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:59.172
THE GROUND- WE ARE DOING THAT

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:00.706
KIND OF INNOVATION. AND I THINK

01:58:00.773 --> 01:58:02.074
THAT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY

01:58:02.141 --> 01:58:03.609
MODEL DOES HELP US IN THE

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:05.411
INNOVATION SPACE SO I CANNOT

01:58:05.478 --> 01:58:06.979
REALLY SPEAK TO REGULATORY MAKE

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:11.317
I'M TALKING. MORE ABOUT OUR

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:16.088

STATE OWNERSHIP OF THE

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:20.359

MILLION DOLLARS A MILE. AND ONE

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:50.088
ISSUES I WANT TO BRING UP IS

THAT WE ALL ASK FOR A NEW

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:53.558
GROUNDING BUT YOU CREATE

02:13:53.625 --> 02:13:54.893
ANOTHER PROBLEM ONCE YOU

JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND NINE TO

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:05.604
TEN CONSEQUENCES WE THINK. WE

02:14:05.670 --> 02:14:06.938
CAN UNDERGROUND THIS IS STILL

02:14:07.005 --> 02:14:08.240
ALL THERE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:11.209
WITHOUT CAUSING. LONGER DELAYS

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:11.843
WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT AFTER

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:12.844
REAL QUICK QUESTION AS IT

02:14:12.911 --> 02:14:15.414
RELATES TO- LYING CLEARING. AND

02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:17.015
THAT HAS BEEN A SUBJECT OF

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:19.584
GREAT CONTENTION- BOTH HERE AND

02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:22.020
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND AS A

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:23.688
FORMER EDISON EMPLOYEE WHO

REPRESENTED A URBAN AREA I KNEW

02:14:26.258 --> 02:14:28.193
THE CHALLENGES OF. ACCESSING

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:29.961
JUST A RESIDENTIAL BACKYARD CAN

02:14:30.028 --> 02:14:37.369
YOU EXPLAIN SOME THE CHALLENGES.

02:14:37.436 --> 02:14:37.936
YOU FACE IN A WORLD WHERE AN

02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:42.774
ACCESS AND SOME YOUR FACILITIES.

02:14:42.841 --> 02:14:43.842
THOROUGHLY CENTER SITE I THINK

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.811
THERE'S A COUPLE DIMENSIONS YOU

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:48.847
SAID A RURAL AREA. SIR

02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:49.748
UNDERSTANDABLY- PASSIONATE

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:50.215
ABOUT THEIR TREES ARE

02:14:50.282 --> 02:14:52.150
VEGETATION- SO ACCESS CAN BE

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.785
SOMETHING OF A CHALLENGE- MANY

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:54.553
OR IS THAT WE ARE CLEARING ARE

02:14:54.619 --> 02:14:56.188
NOT- A CUSTOMER OWN THEY'RE

02:14:56.254 --> 02:14:56.922
ACTUALLY ON NATIONAL FOREST

02:14:56.988 --> 02:14:57.889
LAND AND AREAS- SUCH AS THAT

02:14:57.956 --> 02:14:59.624
SO- WE HAVE TO WORK TO

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.860
PERMITTING PROCESSES TO GET-

02:15:01.927 --> 02:15:02.861
GET PERMISSION TO CLEAR

02:15:02.928 --> 02:15:05.230
VEGETATION THOSE AREAS- BUT

02:15:05.297 --> 02:15:07.332
EVEN WHILE AND URBAN INTERFACE-

02:15:07.399 --> 02:15:09.868
VEGETATION CLEARING- IS A

02:15:09.935 --> 02:15:10.969
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE CAN BE A

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:13.472
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE- WE

02:15:13.538 --> 02:15:14.906
ULTIMATELY ARE MOVING OUR

02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:17.242
CLEARANCE DISTANCES WHICH CAN

02:15:17.309 --> 02:15:20.045
BE PERCEIVED AS A AS A SHOCK TO

02:15:20.111 --> 02:15:21.413
SOME WHO HAVE SEEN BUDGETARY

02:15:21.480 --> 02:15:23.448
SOME CLEARANCE- OVER THE YEARS

02:15:23.515 --> 02:15:24.850
AT A MUCH LOWER DISTANCE FROM

02:15:24.916 --> 02:15:26.952
TREES BUT WE'VE- CONCLUDED

02:15:27.018 --> 02:15:29.654
THAT- MORE DISTANCE IS BETTER

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:31.156
IT. KEEPS A SAFER- SO I'D SAY

02:15:31.223 --> 02:15:32.324
DOING- IN GAUGING WITH

02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:33.558
CUSTOMERS ENGAGE WITH

02:15:33.625 --> 02:15:38.129
COMMUNITIES HELPING. THEM

02:15:38.196 --> 02:15:38.763
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:42.033
IS PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS. ONE

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:43.635
OF OUR CHALLENGES- WE ARE WE

02:15:43.702 --> 02:15:45.937
HAVE RAMPED UP DRAMATICALLY OUR

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:48.406
VEGETATION CRUZ I THINK PRICE

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:51.943
BETTER BOOK SOON. SEE WHAT THE

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:53.245
LARGE UNDERTAKING IS A WE HAVE

02:15:53.311 --> 02:15:53.879
CLOSE TO MILLION TREES IN OUR

02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:55.213
TRIM INVENTORY- WE HAVE SEVEN

02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:56.314
HUNDRED CRUISE ATTITUDE A THREE

02:15:56.381 --> 02:15:57.182
MAN CREW WORKING ON THESE UP

02:15:57.249 --> 02:15:59.384
ALL TO ALL THE TIME SO THIS IS

02:15:59.451 --> 02:16:00.986
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT

02:16:01.052 --> 02:16:01.486
WE'RE DOING SO THERE'S

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:02.521
LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

02:16:02.587 --> 02:16:04.189
OB BUT IT'S ONE OF OUR

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:05.023
IMPORTANT PROGRAMS IT'S BEEN

02:16:05.090 --> 02:16:06.958
AROUND FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVE

02:16:07.025 --> 02:16:08.927
ENHANCED IT- OVER THE LAST YEAR

02:16:08.994 --> 02:16:13.665
YEAR AND A HALF- AND IT'S AGAIN

02:16:13.732 --> 02:16:14.299
ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS

02:16:14.366 --> 02:16:17.168
ARE. WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN.

02:16:17.235 --> 02:16:18.203
SO I ONE SUGGESTION AS IT

02:16:18.270 --> 02:16:19.704
RELATES TO LINE CLEAR AND THE

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:21.339
COST THAT'S BEING INCURRED

02:16:21.406 --> 02:16:21.940
SPECIALLY WITHOUT OUT OF STATE

02:16:22.007 --> 02:16:23.642
CONTRACTORS. ALLIES IN SOME OF

02:16:23.708 --> 02:16:24.643
THE SAME INMATES THERE ON THE

02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:26.478
FIRE LINES THAT FIGHT THESE

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:27.712
FIRES INTO A LOT A LINE

02:16:27.779 --> 02:16:29.180
CLEARING WHY WOULD YOU NOT

02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:31.683
CONTRACT WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS

02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.351
AND ALLOW THEM TO DO IT VERSUS

02:16:33.418 --> 02:16:35.120
BRINGING IN ALL THESE OUT OF

02:16:35.186 --> 02:16:36.621
STATE CONTRACTORS. AND DRIVING

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:40.325
THE COST UP- WE HAVE FIVE IN A

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:42.260
LOT OF AREAS- NOT JUST OF

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:43.895
VEGETATION CLEARANCE BUT-

02:16:43.962 --> 02:16:45.797
OVERALL CREWS THAT ACTUALLY DO

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:47.599
THE WORK- WE HAVE RAMPED UP OUR

02:17:01.346 --> 02:17:02.347
WE HAVE PREFERENCE IN STATE OUT

02:17:02.414 --> 02:17:03.515

WITH THE SCALE AND DURATION OF

02:28:06.410 --> 02:28:06.777
THE SHOT OFF AND ARE

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:09.146

ABOUT BETTER MANAGING THESE

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:13.050
EVENTS AND REDUCING THEIR

02:28:13.117 --> 02:28:16.354
IMPACT. THE NEXT TIME EXTREME

02:28:16.420 --> 02:28:16.921
WEATHER REQUIRES FACING SUCH

02:28:16.988 --> 02:28:20.791
DECISIONS AGAIN. AND FINALLY I

02:28:20.858 --> 02:28:21.592
WANT TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION

THAT ARE. PER COLLEAGUES HAD

02:28:24.395 --> 02:28:25.763
ABOUT HOW WE'RE WORKING TOWARD

02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:27.331
A FUTURE WHERE THE KIND OF

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:29.667
LARGE SCALE SHUT OFF WE'VE

02:28:29.734 --> 02:28:30.201
EXPERIENCED. ARE NO LONGER

02:28:30.268 --> 02:28:34.372
NECESSARY. PARDON ME. FIRST LET

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:36.407
ME EMPHASIZE A BASIC FACT IT.

02:28:36.474 --> 02:28:37.508
REALLY SHOULD BE OBVIOUS BY

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:39.176
THINGS EASILY LOST IN THE

02:28:39.243 --> 02:28:39.744
TURBULENT ATMOSPHERE AROUND

02:28:39.810 --> 02:28:42.546
THIS. WE DON'T ACTUALLY WANT TO

02:28:42.613 --> 02:28:45.816
TURN ANYBODY'S POWER OFF. IT'S

02:28:45.883 --> 02:28:47.551
THE LAND OF HIS GOT INTO THIS

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:50.254
BUSINESS IS NOT THE WAY WE WANT

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:50.821
TO SERVE CUSTOMERS WE REALLY

02:28:50.888 --> 02:28:52.723
DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AND WE

02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:54.091
RECOGNIZE THE LIVING WITHOUT

02:28:54.158 --> 02:28:56.060
POWER IS MORE THAN JUST AN

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:56.627
INCONVENIENCE FOR MANY IS A

02:28:56.694 --> 02:28:59.397
HARDSHIP. WITH POTENTIALLY

02:28:59.463 --> 02:29:01.165
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FROM

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:02.233
DISRUPTED ROUTINES AND SCHOOL

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:04.969
CLOSURES. STRAINED BUDGETS AND

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:06.837
LOST INCOME AND FOR THE MOST

02:29:06.904 --> 02:29:09.240
VULNERABLE AMONG US. THOSE WHO

02:29:09.307 --> 02:29:12.076
DEPEND ON LIFE SUSTAINING

02:29:12.143 --> 02:29:12.710
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CANNOT AFFORD

02:29:12.777 --> 02:29:14.779
TO REPLACE LOST FOOD. LOSING

02:29:14.845 --> 02:29:16.747
POWER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:17.381
CAN COME WITH CONSIDERABLE FEAR

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:20.184
AND SAFETY RISKS. SO NONE OF US

02:29:20.251 --> 02:29:23.554
WANT TO LIVE IN THAT WORLD. BUT

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:24.789
WE'RE DOING THIS WITH THE

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:26.057
SINGULAR PURPOSE OF PREVENTING

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:27.692
THE DEADLY CATASTROPHIC FIRES

02:29:27.758 --> 02:29:30.661
WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS.

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:31.262
NONE OF US WANTS TO SEE THOSE

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:33.798
HAPPEN AGAIN EITHER. I THINK IT

02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:36.701
MIGHT BE WORTH A MOMENT HERE TO.

02:29:36.767 --> 02:29:37.935
LOOK AT HOW WE GOT TO THIS

02:29:38.002 --> 02:29:39.370
POINT CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY IN

02:29:39.437 --> 02:29:41.906
THE SPEED OF CHANGE AROUND US.

02:29:41.972 --> 02:29:43.874
OVER THE PAST FEWYEARS THE

02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:45.142
WILD FIRE RISK IN OUR SERVICE

02:29:45.209 --> 02:29:46.777
AREA ALONE HAS INCREASED AT A

02:29:46.844 --> 02:29:50.047
RATE THAT FEW. COULD IMAGINE.

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.549
REGIONALES TWENTY TWELVE THE

02:29:51.615 --> 02:29:52.883
PARTS OF THE STATE DESIGNATED

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:54.418
AS HAVING AN ELEVATED RISK OF

02:29:54.485 --> 02:29:56.954
WILDFIRE MADE UP LESS THAN 15%

02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:59.423
OF P. JEANNIE SERVICE AREA. IN

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:02.293
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA.

02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:03.894
IN FACT IN TWENTY TEN- TWELVE

02:30:03.961 --> 02:30:05.496
IN DEALING WITH THE S. P. S.

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:06.097
IMMENSELY AT A DIFFERENT NAME

02:30:06.163 --> 02:30:09.800
THEN. THE CPUC SAID THIS QUOTE

02:30:09.867 --> 02:30:10.835
THERE'S NO HISTORY OF

02:30:10.901 --> 02:30:12.336
CATASTROPHIC POWER LINE FIRES

02:30:12.403 --> 02:30:15.039
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND

02:30:15.106 --> 02:30:16.374
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOESN'T

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:18.142
EXPERIENCE THE SANTA ANA WINDS

02:30:18.209 --> 02:30:19.543
TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO

02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:21.946
THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC POWER

02:30:22.012 --> 02:30:22.413
LINE FIRES IN SOUTHERN

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:26.217
CALIFORNIA. BUT THAT CHANGED

02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:28.419
AND CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN

02:30:28.486 --> 02:30:29.720
TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE THAN EIGHT

02:30:29.787 --> 02:30:31.622
THOUSAND FIRES BURNED ACROSS

02:30:31.689 --> 02:30:32.223
CALIFORNIA BURNED TWO MILLION

02:30:32.289 --> 02:30:35.159
ACRES. AND ALTHOUGH ELECTRIC

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:36.827
EQUIPMENT HISTORICALLY HAS

02:30:36.894 --> 02:30:37.328
BECAUSE LESS THAN 10% OF

02:30:37.395 --> 02:30:40.398
WILDFIRES. ACCOUNT FOR ROUGHLY

02:30:40.464 --> 02:30:42.233
HALF OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:44.802
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY.

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:46.904
AND NEED AS BROAD PS PS TO THE

02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:49.940
FORE AS A TOOL TO ENSURE PUBLIC

02:30:50.007 --> 02:30:50.508
SAFETY PARTICULARLY NORTHERN

02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:52.576
CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT DOES THIS

02:30:52.643 --> 02:30:55.880
MEAN FOR P. GINNY AS CUSTOMERS

02:30:55.946 --> 02:30:56.414
WHY THE INCREASE IN PS PS

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:59.150
EVENTS. BECAUSE THE RISK OF

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:01.118
FIRE HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY

02:31:01.185 --> 02:31:03.654
TODAY THAT RISK FOOTPRINT OF

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:06.457
LESS THAN 15% TWENTY TWELVE.

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:07.825
DOWN VALVES MORE THAN 50% OF

02:31:07.892 --> 02:31:11.328
PIGEON A SYSTEM. THAT'S SYSTEM

02:31:11.395 --> 02:31:12.897
COVER SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE

02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:13.798
MILES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:31:13.864 --> 02:31:15.933
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.201
THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND

02:31:17.268 --> 02:31:17.735
SQUARE MILES OF HIGH FIRE

02:31:17.802 --> 02:31:20.004
THREAT AREA. LET'S JUST THINK

02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.640
ABOUT THAT FOR A MINUTE. THE

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:24.175
RISK EXPOSURE THIS ENERGY

02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:25.876
NETWORK CONSERVE SIXTEEN

02:31:25.943 --> 02:31:27.678
MILLION PEOPLE IS MORE THAN

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:30.648
TRIPLE A 3100% INCREASE. OVER

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:32.650
APPEAR THAT MOST COMPANIES IN

02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:33.217
THIS INDUSTRY WOULD CONSIDER

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:36.086
THE BLINK OF AN EYE. AND SO WE

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:36.754
HAVE TO COPE WITH THIS

02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:37.922
HEIGHTENED RISK THE BEST THAT

02:31:37.988 --> 02:31:40.658
WE CAN AND TURNING UP POWER FOR

02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:42.626
SAFETY IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL. AS

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:44.628
OUR COLLEAGUE SAID EARLIER

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:45.596
REALLY ONLY ONE OFTHE MANY

02:31:45.663 --> 02:31:48.165
TOOLS WERE USING. TO BRING DOWN

02:31:48.232 --> 02:31:49.633
THE RISK OF HIGH WINDS DRY

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:51.502
CONDITIONS AND ELECTRICAL

02:31:51.569 --> 02:31:52.036
EQUIPMENT THAT CAN CAUSE A

02:31:52.102 --> 02:31:53.571
SPARK. AND WE WILL GET BETTER

02:31:53.637 --> 02:31:58.476
USING. SO WHAT IS THE SYSTEM WE

02:31:58.542 --> 02:31:59.677
HAVE TODAY WHAT SORT OF SHAPE

02:31:59.743 --> 02:32:01.645
IS IT IN AND HOW WELL SUITED

02:32:01.712 --> 02:32:04.348
ISN'T TO THIS NEW LEVEL OF RISK.

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:05.783
FIRST THERE'S A PERCEPTION AND

02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:08.986
I HEARD HERE TODAY. THAT OUR

02:32:09.053 --> 02:32:09.954
SYSTEM IS IN SHAMBLES THAT WE

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.989
HAVEN'T INVESTED IN. AND THAT

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:14.124
WE'RE TURNING OFF THE POWER

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:14.692
BECAUSE WE'VE NEGLECTED THE

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:17.361
EQUIPMENT. SO I'VE HEARD THIS A

02:32:17.428 --> 02:32:20.064
LOT I'VE BEEN HERE SIX MONTHS.

02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:21.398
EVER DISALLOWED THAT SIX MONTHS

02:32:21.465 --> 02:32:22.833
AND I OF MOSTLY AVOIDED

02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:24.969
ANSWERING THIS QUESTION BY

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:25.569
SAYING I CAME TO LOOK FORWARD

02:32:25.636 --> 02:32:31.442
NOT BACK. OF. BUT I GOT IT HAS

02:32:31.509 --> 02:32:32.076
SO MANY TIMES I THOUGHT I WOULD

02:32:32.142 --> 02:32:34.745
INVESTIGATE WHAT THE FACTS. AND

02:32:34.812 --> 02:32:36.380
SO HERE THE FAX OVER THE LAST

02:32:36.447 --> 02:32:38.182
TEN YEARS P. GINNY HAS INVESTED

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:39.350
MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:42.019
DOLLARS. IN HIS ELECTRIC

02:32:42.086 --> 02:32:42.620
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

02:32:42.686 --> 02:32:45.856
ASSETS. IN UTILITY SPACE

02:32:45.923 --> 02:32:48.959
PROFITS ARE GENERALLY DESCRIBED

02:32:49.026 --> 02:32:49.493
AS EARNING THE RETURN THE

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:52.029
COMMISSION SUCH FOR YOU. OVER

02:32:52.096 --> 02:32:54.532
THE LAST TEN YEARS FUSION IS

02:32:54.598 --> 02:32:55.099
TAKEN TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF

02:32:55.165 --> 02:32:58.168
THAT RETURN. AND PUT IT BACK

02:32:58.235 --> 02:33:00.037
INTO THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM SO I

02:33:00.104 --> 02:33:02.106
CAN PUT THIS IN ANY GREATER

02:33:02.172 --> 02:33:04.608
CONTEXT FOR YOU BUT THOSE ARE

02:33:04.675 --> 02:33:05.175
SORT OF THE NUMBERS OF WHAT

02:33:05.242 --> 02:33:05.709
HAPPENED OVER THE LAST TEN

02:33:05.776 --> 02:33:08.746
YEARS. MORE RECENTLY HE WE

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:10.214
FINISHED AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:11.715
PROCESS TO INSPECT EVERY

02:33:11.782 --> 02:33:13.784
ELEMENT OF OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:14.351
WITHIN THE HIGH FIRE THREAT

02:33:14.418 --> 02:33:17.555
AREAS. WE INSPECTED ALMOST

02:33:17.621 --> 02:33:19.523
SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY

02:33:19.590 --> 02:33:19.990
THOUSAND TRANSMISSION

02:33:20.057 --> 02:33:20.658
DISTRIBUTION SUBSTATIONS

02:33:20.724 --> 02:33:23.294
STRUCTURES. OVER TWENTY FIVE

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:23.861
MILLION DISCRETE ELECTRICAL

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:26.830
COMPONENTS. WE CLIMB THESE

02:33:26.897 --> 02:33:28.165
THINGS WE USE DRONES WE

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:29.767
PERFORMED EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF

02:33:29.833 --> 02:33:30.301
INSPECTIONS IN ABOUT FOUR

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:32.970
MONTHS. WHATEVER WE FOUND

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:34.872
EQUIPMENT THE NEEDED IMMEDIATE

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:37.508
REPAIR WE FIXED OR REPLACED.

02:33:37.575 --> 02:33:38.876
WE'LL BE SURE THAT EVERY PIECE

02:33:38.943 --> 02:33:40.477
OF ELECTORAL QUITMAN WITHIN THE

02:33:40.544 --> 02:33:43.480
NEXT TO THE HIGH FIRE THREAT

02:33:43.547 --> 02:33:44.081
AREA IS SUITABLE TO SERVE OUR

02:33:44.148 --> 02:33:46.417
CUSTOMERS AND SYSTEM. ON

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:47.551
MANAGING VEGETATION LONG RIGHT

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:49.253
AWAY AS ALONE WE SPENT THREE

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:49.853
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:52.990
TEN YEARS. THE LAST TWO YEARS

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.925
WE TRIMMED ALMOST SEVEN MILLION

02:33:54.992 --> 02:33:56.260
TREES REMOVED A HALF A MILLION

02:33:56.327 --> 02:33:59.430
DEAD TREES. ARE VEGETATION

02:33:59.496 --> 02:34:00.030
CLEARANCE EFFORT SUCCEEDS THEY

02:34:00.097 --> 02:34:03.867
REQUIRE. BUT THE FACT IS NO MAN

02:34:03.934 --> 02:34:05.235
OF TREE CLEARING CAN PREVENT

02:34:05.302 --> 02:34:06.637
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES ARE

02:34:06.704 --> 02:34:08.772
WINDBLOWN DEBRIS FROM HITTING

02:34:08.839 --> 02:34:11.675
AND IMPACTING OUR CLICK. TWO

02:34:11.742 --> 02:34:12.977
ENORMOUS THERE ARE WORK WILL

02:34:13.043 --> 02:34:15.012
NEVER BE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO

02:34:15.079 --> 02:34:15.579
SAFETY OR DETERMINE TO GET A

02:34:15.646 --> 02:34:18.082
RIGHT. BUT WE BELIEVE WE MAKE

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:20.784
IT MAY GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

02:34:20.851 --> 02:34:23.454
OF RISK WITH THESE PS PS VENTS.

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:24.054
SO NOW FEW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:27.091
OCTOBER EVENTS. NUMBER OF

02:34:27.157 --> 02:34:29.994
CUSTOMERS AFFECTED NAY ANYONE'S

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:32.563
FIJIAN AVAIL WAS NINE HUNDRED

02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:33.097
FORTY ONE THOUSAND AS WAS

02:34:33.163 --> 02:34:34.298
MENTIONED EARLIER THOSE OR

02:34:34.365 --> 02:34:36.266
ACCOUNTS WERE METERS SO YOU CAN

02:34:36.333 --> 02:34:37.635
MULTIPLY THAT ROUGHLY BY TWO

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.703
AND A HALF TIMES TO GET TO THE

02:34:39.770 --> 02:34:42.239
NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED WHICH

02:34:42.306 --> 02:34:42.840
IS REALLY. THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:34:42.906 --> 02:34:45.209
THING. OUR RECORDS SHOW THE

02:34:45.275 --> 02:34:47.244
LONGER STUDIES PERIOD WAS FIVE

02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:48.979
DAYS AGAIN DURING THE FINAL

02:34:49.046 --> 02:34:50.714
WEEK OF OCTOBER WHEN WE SAW TWO

02:34:50.781 --> 02:34:53.817
METEOROLOGICAL SYSTEMS. THE

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:54.418
SEVERE WINDS ONLY FORTY EIGHT

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:57.154
HOURS APART. EXTREME WEATHER

02:34:57.221 --> 02:34:59.023
THE PROPERTIES TO SHUT OFF WAS

02:34:59.089 --> 02:35:01.659
A ONE IN THIRTY YEAR VAN WITH

02:35:01.725 --> 02:35:02.226
SOME OF THE STRONGEST WINDS

02:35:02.292 --> 02:35:04.261
EVER RECORDED IN THE REGION.

02:35:04.328 --> 02:35:05.863
INCLUDING GUSTIN SONMA COUNTY

02:35:05.929 --> 02:35:08.332
OF A HUNDRED TWO MILES AN HOUR.

02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:09.933
AND OVER SEVENTY MILE OUR IN

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.802
MANY OTHER PLACES HUMIDITY

02:35:11.869 --> 02:35:14.104
LEVELS WERE EXTREMELY LOW. WITH

02:35:14.171 --> 02:35:16.473
BONE DRY AIR MORE TYPICAL OF

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:17.074
THE MOJAVE DESERT IN NORTHERN

02:35:17.141 --> 02:35:19.877
CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN HIS

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:22.312
HISTORIC WIN SUBSIDED MORE THAN

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:23.280
SIX THOUSAND FIELD PERSONNEL

02:35:23.347 --> 02:35:25.683
ALONG WITH MORE THAN NINE

02:35:25.749 --> 02:35:26.316
HUNDRED MUTUALLY TEAMS FROM THE

SORT OF MILES OF TRANSMISSION

02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:33.323
AND DISTRIBUTION WAS MORE THAN

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:35.359
ENOUGH TO CIRCLE THE EARTH.

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:36.593
FOUND HUNDREDS OF INSTANCES OF

02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:37.094

BOUNDARIES OF THE RIGHT AWAY.

02:35:45.502 --> 02:35:46.270
CHINESE EXTREME WEATHER

02:35:46.336 --> 02:35:48.372
CONDITIONS FIERCE WINDS NEAR

02:35:48.439 --> 02:35:48.939
ZERO HUMIDITY IN THE PARTIAL

02:35:49.006 --> 02:35:52.142
LANDSCAPE. PARDON ME THESE

02:35:52.209 --> 02:35:53.844
TYPES OF HAZARDS COULD HAVE

02:35:53.911 --> 02:35:55.012
SPARKED THE DEADLY CATASTROPHIC

02:35:55.079 --> 02:35:56.914
FIRE. AND PREVENTING THIS

02:35:56.980 --> 02:36:00.217
OUTCOME IS EXACTLY AND THE SOLE

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:00.818
REASON WE CALL THESE P. S. P.

02:36:00.884 --> 02:36:03.420
S. OF IT. PUBLIC SAFETY IS WHAT

02:36:03.487 --> 02:36:04.722
THIS IS ALL ABOUT IN OUR

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:06.623
PRIORITY MUST BE TO PROTECT

02:36:06.690 --> 02:36:11.795
HUMAN LIVES. ABOVE ALL ELSE.

02:36:11.862 --> 02:36:14.131
LOOKING BACK OVER THESE EVENTS

02:36:14.198 --> 02:36:14.732
WE KNOW OUR PERFORMANCE WASN'T

02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:19.336
PERFECT. THE. PARTICULARLY IN

02:36:19.403 --> 02:36:21.071
THE OCTOBER NINTH EVENT AND NOW

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:24.074
WE CAN AND WILL AND HAVE TO DO

02:36:24.141 --> 02:36:26.510
BETTER FOR EXAMPLE OUR WEBSITE

02:36:26.577 --> 02:36:29.580
CRASH SEVERAL TIMES. OUR MAPS

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:30.481
WERE INCONSISTENT OR CALL

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:32.116
CENTERS ROVER LOADED MAINLY

02:36:32.182 --> 02:36:33.150
AFFECTED BY THE WEBSITE

02:36:33.217 --> 02:36:35.052
PROBLEMS. OUR LEVEL OF

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.420
COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION

02:36:36.487 --> 02:36:38.822
WITH THE RELEVANT STATE LOCAL

02:36:38.889 --> 02:36:39.423
AND TRIBAL AGENCIES FELL SHORT

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:42.359
OF THE MARK. AND WE LEARN FROM

02:36:42.426 --> 02:36:43.961
THE SHORTCOMINGS IN FAILURES WE

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:45.229
LISTEN TO SEE BACK WE'VE

02:36:45.295 --> 02:36:48.232
RECEIVED. AND WE PERFORMED OUR

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:48.832
WE'VE IMPROVED OUR PERFORMANCE

02:36:48.899 --> 02:36:51.235
EACH TIME. THE P. S. P. S.

02:36:51.301 --> 02:36:53.103
EVENTS LATER IN THE MONTH

02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:53.737
DEMONSTRATED THAT WE ARE

02:36:53.804 --> 02:36:55.873
CONSTANTLY WORKING TOGETHER. TO

02:36:55.939 --> 02:36:56.473
GET BETTER SO ARE WE DOING TO

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:59.209
GET BETTER. OUR PS PS

02:36:59.276 --> 02:37:00.511
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:02.012
EXPANDED REFINED TO REACH MORE

02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:04.681
PEOPLE MORE RELIABLY. OUR

02:37:04.748 --> 02:37:06.183
WEBSITE AND CALL CENTERS ARE

02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:07.451
NOW WE WILL HAVE A MUCH HIGHER

02:37:07.518 --> 02:37:09.520
LEVELS OF TRAFFIC AND DID SO

02:37:09.586 --> 02:37:10.120
WITHOUT INCIDENT IN THE LATER

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:12.923
EVENTS. SHARPENING THE QUALITY

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:15.726
OF OUR OUTREACH MAPS. AND WE'VE

02:37:15.793 --> 02:37:16.860
IMPROVE COORDINATION AND

02:37:16.927 --> 02:37:18.428
COMMUNICATION WITH A GOVERNMENT

02:37:18.495 --> 02:37:19.830
AGENCY PARTNERS INCLUDING

ALONGSIDE US. IN OUR EMERGENCY

02:37:25.402 --> 02:37:28.739
OPERATIONS CENTER. BUT THERE'S

02:37:28.806 --> 02:37:30.307
A LARGER LESSON TO BE DRAWN

02:37:30.374 --> 02:37:31.875
HERE ONE THAT WE UNDERSTAND

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:33.977
EQUALLY WELL AND THAT IS

02:37:34.044 --> 02:37:35.112
REPEATEDLY TURNING OFF POWER

02:37:35.179 --> 02:37:36.914
FROM MILLIONS OF PEOPLE. IN ONE

02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:38.782
OF THE MOST ADVANCED ECONOMIES

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:39.716
IN THE WORLD EVEN IN THE

02:37:39.783 --> 02:37:41.952
INTEREST OF SAFETY. IS NOTA

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:43.787
SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO THE

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:46.423
WILDFIRE THREATS WE FACE. CHAU

02:37:46.490 --> 02:37:48.258
ASSURE YOU OF THIS WE DO NOT

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:50.027
EXPECT AN ANNUAL REPEAT OF WHAT

02:37:50.093 --> 02:37:51.895
WE WENT THROUGH THIS OCTOBER.

02:37:51.962 --> 02:37:54.064
AND WHAT WE PUT OUR CUSTOMERS

02:37:54.131 --> 02:37:54.631
AND OTHERS THROUGH THAT JUST

02:37:54.698 --> 02:37:56.733
CANNOT HAPPEN AGAIN. WE'RE

02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:57.968
WORKING TO NARROW THE SCOPE AND

02:37:58.035 --> 02:37:59.670
DURATION OF FUTURE SAFETY SHUT

02:37:59.736 --> 02:38:01.405
OFFS AND MINIMIZE YOUR CUSTOMER

02:38:01.471 --> 02:38:04.408
IMPACT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

WE'RE HARNESSING NEW TOOLS AND

02:38:05.642 --> 02:38:07.411
TECHNOLOGIES TO HELP US DO THAT

02:38:07.477 --> 02:38:09.580
INCLUDING MORE WEATHER STATIONS

02:38:09.646 --> 02:38:10.147

SEXUAL LODGING DEVICES AND

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:15.786
TEMPORARY GENERATION THAT ALLOW

02:38:15.853 --> 02:38:17.487
US TO TARGET THE SHUT OFF AND

02:38:17.554 --> 02:38:18.021
KEEP THE POWER ON FOR MORE

02:38:18.088 --> 02:38:22.125
PEOPLE. THE SINGLE. HELP

02:38:22.192 --> 02:38:22.726
THEY'LL HELP TREMENDOUSLY EVEN

02:38:22.793 --> 02:38:24.862
BEFORE NEXT FIRE SEASON. IN

02:38:24.928 --> 02:38:26.597
FACT WE HAVE A SIMILAR HISTORIC

02:38:26.663 --> 02:38:28.365
WINDOW VENT NEXT OCTOBER WE

02:38:28.432 --> 02:38:32.536
BELIEVE THE WORK THEY WERESCOPING RIGHT NOW CAN REDUCE

02:38:32.603 --> 02:38:33.136
THAT OVERALL THE FOOTPRINT BY

02:38:33.203 --> 02:38:35.372
AT LEAST ONE THE- EVER THINKING

02:38:35.439 --> 02:38:36.874
CREATIVELY ABOUT OTHER WAYS TO

02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:38.108
HELP OUR CUSTOMERS AND

02:38:38.175 --> 02:38:39.776
COMMUNITIES GET THROUGH THESE

02:38:39.843 --> 02:38:40.310
OUTAGES WITH LESS HARM AN

02:38:40.377 --> 02:38:43.747
INCONVENIENCE. WE'LL SPAR

02:38:43.814 --> 02:38:44.348
PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE STATE TO

02:38:44.414 --> 02:38:47.351
ACHIEVE THESE IMPROVEMENTS. BUT

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:48.952
THAT'S THE PACE OF CHANGE THAT

02:38:49.019 --> 02:38:50.153
WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THE NEAR

02:38:50.220 --> 02:38:52.189
TERM OVER THE LONGER TERM WILL

02:38:52.256 --> 02:38:52.789
CONTINUE TO HARDEN OUR SYSTEM

02:38:52.856 --> 02:38:54.825
IS STRONG THE WIRES AND POLES

02:38:54.892 --> 02:38:56.927
MANAGING VEGETATION. AND

02:38:56.994 --> 02:38:58.795
PUTTING MORE OF OUR

02:38:58.862 --> 02:38:59.329
INFRASTRUCTURE UNDERGROUND

02:38:59.396 --> 02:39:02.366
CERTAIN AREAS. SO CLOSE I WANT

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:03.233
TO ASSURE EVERYONE THE

02:39:03.300 --> 02:39:04.801
CHALLENGE OF PROVIDING ELECTRIC

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:06.003
SERVICE IN AN INCREASINGLY

02:39:06.069 --> 02:39:07.671
HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT IS ONE

02:39:07.738 --> 02:39:09.339
THAT OUR COMPANY MUST AND WILL

02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:11.942
MASTER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS

02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:13.777
ISSUE THAT WE AND MILLIONS OF

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:16.647
CALIFORNIANS CARE DEEPLY ABOUT.

02:39:16.713 --> 02:39:19.182

NAY AT ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:24.421

DESIRE AND FOCUS ON THE HEAD

02:39:45.943 --> 02:39:49.112
AND INDEED WE MUST WE CAN'T

02:39:49.179 --> 02:39:49.680
LOOK AHEAD WITHOUT LOOKING A

02:39:49.746 --> 02:39:54.551
LITTLE BIT BACK. IN IT IS A

02:39:54.618 --> 02:39:57.321
LITTLE BIT UNNERVING TO ME THAT.

02:39:57.387 --> 02:39:59.389
SO MANY THESE THINGS THAT. YOU

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:03.393
AND OTHERS HAVE IMPLEMENTED.

02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:03.994
ONLY OCCUR WHEN WE'VE HAD THIS

02:40:04.061 --> 02:40:05.662
TREMENDOUS FIRE. PROBLEM IN

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:09.166
CALIFORNIA. NOW THE FIRE

02:40:09.232 --> 02:40:11.601
PROBLEM INTO DEVELOPING FOR

02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:12.235
DECADES GLOBAL WARMING FOR MORE

02:40:12.302 --> 02:40:14.938
THAN DECADES. AND THE

02:40:15.005 --> 02:40:17.908
ACCUMULATION OF FUELS AND ARE

02:40:17.975 --> 02:40:18.442
FORCING A WHILE LANCE MANY

02:40:18.508 --> 02:40:21.678
DECADES. AND BY THE WAY THAT'S

02:40:21.745 --> 02:40:23.580
A STATE AND FEDERAL PROBLEM TOO

02:40:23.647 --> 02:40:25.349
AND THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE

02:40:25.415 --> 02:40:26.650
DOING A DISSERVICE IF WE DO

02:40:26.717 --> 02:40:29.853
NOT. EXAMINE STATE AND FEDERAL

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:33.724
pACCUMULATION OF FUELS.

02:40:33.790 --> 02:40:35.625
SOMETHING THAT DOES AFFECT YOU

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:36.159
BUT YOU DON'T SO ENTIRELY

02:40:36.226 --> 02:40:42.132
CONTROL. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT

02:40:42.199 --> 02:40:45.369
TO THE POINT THE COMMUNICATIONS.

02:40:45.435 --> 02:40:48.538
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT SUCH

02:40:48.605 --> 02:40:49.306
DISASTERS COULD HAVE BEEN

02:40:49.373 --> 02:40:51.942
ANTICIPATED AND COMMUNICATION

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:52.809
MECHANISMS AND PRIORITIZE

02:40:52.876 --> 02:40:55.012
HAITIANS IT COULD HAVE BEEN

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:58.749
ANTICIPATED AND EXIT AT YOUR

02:40:58.815 --> 02:40:59.316
EXIGENCY SET UP FOR THAT IN

02:40:59.383 --> 02:41:01.985
ADVANCE. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE

02:41:02.052 --> 02:41:02.552
THIS IS REALLY BEEN GOING ON

02:41:02.619 --> 02:41:06.757
THE WAY. UP FOR EXAMPLE THIS

02:41:06.823 --> 02:41:08.959
NOTIFICATION OF THE NEXT ROUND

02:41:09.026 --> 02:41:10.627
THAT WAS FAR BETTER THAN THE

02:41:10.694 --> 02:41:12.496
ONES THAT I'VE RECEIVED BEFORE.

02:41:12.562 --> 02:41:15.632
SO YOU ARE IMPROVE. BUT IT

02:41:15.699 --> 02:41:16.099
WOULD SEEM LIKE THAT'S

02:41:16.166 --> 02:41:17.100
SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN.

02:41:17.167 --> 02:41:22.572
ANTICIPATED AND IF THE

02:41:22.639 --> 02:41:25.075
COMMUNICATION THAT WAS KIND OF

02:41:25.142 --> 02:41:25.675
ONE OF THE GREAT IRONIES THAT

02:41:25.742 --> 02:41:28.278
I'VE RECALL. THERE'S BEEN

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:31.114
SEVERAL CONFERENCE CALLS WITH

02:41:31.181 --> 02:41:35.185
LEADERS ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:35.752
ONE OF THE FIRST CONFERENCE

02:41:35.819 --> 02:41:37.521
CALLS FAILED. EVEN THE

02:41:37.587 --> 02:41:41.625
CONFERENCE CALL. DIDN'T WORK.

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:43.627
AND THAT CERTAINLY CONCERNED ME

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:47.631
A LITTLE BIT. AND THE COMMUNITY

02:41:47.697 --> 02:41:49.166
RESOURCE CENTERS THAT WOULD BE

02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:49.800
ANOTHER THING THAT I WOULD HAVE

02:41:49.866 --> 02:41:53.870
THOUGHT. HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED.

02:41:53.937 --> 02:41:56.706
THE LOCATIONS OF THEM HOME HAVE

02:41:56.773 --> 02:41:57.340
BEEN INCONVENIENT OR IMPOSSIBLE

02:41:57.407 --> 02:41:59.776
FOR SOME. AND WE'VE HAD AN

02:41:59.843 --> 02:42:01.611
AWFUL LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT

02:42:01.678 --> 02:42:04.147
THEM RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES SO

02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:06.983
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF IT. IF THE

02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:09.453
SUPPLIES HAVE DIMINISHED OR NOT

02:42:09.519 --> 02:42:10.053
AVAILABLE. AND THEY'RE NOT AS

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:13.190
ACCESSIBLE. BUT JUST A FEW

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:14.858
WOULD HAZARD SOME OBSERVATIONS

02:42:14.925 --> 02:42:17.127
ABOUT THAT AND- THOSE POINTS

02:42:17.194 --> 02:42:20.464
THAT I'VE RACED. CERTAINLY

02:42:20.530 --> 02:42:23.667
THANK SENATOR- COUPLE THINGS

02:42:23.733 --> 02:42:24.267
FIRST OF ALL AS I SAID THIS IS

02:42:24.334 --> 02:42:26.703
ALL RELATIVELY NEW TO US. WE

02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:29.372
STARTED THIS YEAR WITH SEVERAL

02:42:29.439 --> 02:42:33.777
SMALL EVENTS. ON THE ORDER OF

02:42:33.844 --> 02:42:34.411
400-005-0000 CUSTOMERS IN THOSE

02:42:34.478 --> 02:42:37.147
WENT WELL. AND SO I THINK WE

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:39.449
GOT A LITTLE COMPLACENT WE HAD

02:42:39.516 --> 02:42:40.083
FIGURED OUT AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:43.286
WE SCALED UP TO. YOU KNOW

02:42:43.353 --> 02:42:44.788
TWENTY TIMES THAT SIZE. IN THE

02:42:44.855 --> 02:42:46.923
NEXT EVENT- THE OTHER THING AND

02:42:46.990 --> 02:42:52.796
JUST AN OBSERVATION. I THINK WE.

02:42:52.863 --> 02:42:53.730
THOUGHT THE BIG EVENT WAS

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:56.666
TURNING OFF THE POWER BECAUSE

02:42:56.733 --> 02:42:59.569
FOR US THIS IS AN UNNATURAL ACT

02:42:59.636 --> 02:43:01.738
HEROES IN UTILITY BUSINESS YOUR

02:43:01.805 --> 02:43:02.506
JOB IS TO KEEP THE POWER ON

02:43:02.572 --> 02:43:04.074
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. I THINK WE

02:43:04.141 --> 02:43:06.009
FOCUSED ON THAT IS THE MAIN

02:43:06.076 --> 02:43:06.610
EVENT INSTEAD OF THE IMPACT OF

02:43:06.676 --> 02:43:10.447
THAT. RIGHT ON THE ON THE

02:43:10.514 --> 02:43:12.616
PEOPLE IN AFFECTED SO I THINK

02:43:12.682 --> 02:43:13.884
THOSE ARE THE TWO SORT OF BASIC

02:43:13.950 --> 02:43:15.519
LEARNINGS WE WEREN'T AS WELL AS

02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:16.853
WE THOUGHT. AND WE NEED TO GIVE

02:43:16.920 --> 02:43:19.156
A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION A LOT

02:43:19.222 --> 02:43:21.925
MORE ATTENTION TO. IMPACTS HAVE

02:43:21.992 --> 02:43:23.560
TO SHUT THE POWER OFF AND I DO

02:43:23.627 --> 02:43:24.928
THINK AS THINGS WENT ON WE GOT

02:43:24.995 --> 02:43:26.997
BETTER AND EACH ONE OF THESE.

02:43:27.063 --> 02:43:29.533
HOPING NEVER TO MASTER IT. BUT

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:33.703
I THINK WE HAD BETTER. WELL

02:43:33.770 --> 02:43:34.337
AGAIN JUST TO CLOSE ON MY POINT

02:43:34.404 --> 02:43:38.175
THOUGH. WE HAVE GOT TO

02:43:38.241 --> 02:43:41.378
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS NOT THE NEW

02:43:41.444 --> 02:43:43.346
NORMAL THE STATE CANNOT

02:43:43.413 --> 02:43:46.449
TOLERATE THIS AS THE NEW. IT

02:43:46.516 --> 02:43:47.784
MAY BE CERTAINLY NEW TO YOU

02:43:47.851 --> 02:43:50.020
COMING FROM BACK EAST AND MAYBE

02:43:50.086 --> 02:43:52.622
NOT HAVING FACED THIS. I'VE

02:43:52.689 --> 02:43:53.223
BEEN DEALING WITH IT MY WHOLE

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:56.927
LIFE. HAVING REPRESENTED

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:58.261
EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT CALIFORNIA

02:43:58.328 --> 02:43:59.696
COUNTIES YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW

02:43:59.763 --> 02:44:02.432
MANY FIRES FLOODS AND OTHER

02:44:02.499 --> 02:44:03.033
DISASTERS I'VE HAD TO CONTEND

02:44:03.099 --> 02:44:05.969
WITH. AND THIS IS AN ONGOING

02:44:06.036 --> 02:44:08.672
THING IN THESE COMMUNITIES

02:44:08.738 --> 02:44:10.373
NEVER HAD WE HAD ONE SO

02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:14.177
DEVASTATING IS PARADISE. BUT

02:44:14.244 --> 02:44:14.744
ALL OF THE FUEL IS OUT THERE

02:44:14.811 --> 02:44:17.881
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. SO I'M VERY

02:44:17.948 --> 02:44:19.416
WARY ABOUT IT AND AS WE

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:22.085
ANTICIPATE WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:44:22.152 --> 02:44:24.654
VERY DEEP THINKING AND AGAIN. I

02:44:24.721 --> 02:44:27.824
SUBMIT THINKING ABOUT THE STATE

02:44:27.891 --> 02:44:28.391
AND FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

02:44:28.458 --> 02:44:30.760
THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED AS WELL.

02:44:30.827 --> 02:44:32.596
BUT THE COMMUNICATION IS STILL

02:44:32.662 --> 02:44:34.631
DEFICIENT AND PEOPLE ARE

02:44:34.698 --> 02:44:36.466
EXTRAORDINARILY WORRIED AND

02:44:36.533 --> 02:44:38.368
RIGHTEOUSLY VERY ANGRY. AND

02:44:38.435 --> 02:44:43.940
MANY HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES.

02:44:44.007 --> 02:44:45.875
THANK YOU SIR MORE LUCK THANK

REMARKS I DID NOT HEAR TERMS

02:44:52.115 --> 02:44:54.584
LIKE SECTIONAL EYES OR FAST.

02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:58.288
ACTING FUSES OR POWER TO

02:44:58.355 --> 02:44:59.322
BURGERS OR RAPID EARTH FAULT

02:44:59.389 --> 02:45:01.925
CURRENT LIMITERS- COULD YOU

02:45:01.992 --> 02:45:03.960
MAYBE HELP ME OUT AND WHAT YOU

02:45:04.027 --> 02:45:06.730
SPENT THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS ON

02:45:06.796 --> 02:45:10.700
IN THE LAST. TEN YEARS. WELL AS

02:45:10.767 --> 02:45:11.434
I SAID BUT ALL I COULD DO IS

02:45:11.501 --> 02:45:12.502
FIND THE NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:13.937
EXACTLY WHERE WHEN I KNOW SOME

02:45:14.004 --> 02:45:16.506
OF THE WENT ON SEXUAL ISING I

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:17.574
DON'T THINK ANY OF IT WENT ON

02:45:17.641 --> 02:45:20.176
TO THE MODERN SORT OF FALL

02:45:20.243 --> 02:45:22.012
INTERRUPTION DEVICE I DON'T

02:45:22.078 --> 02:45:22.979
THINK WE HAVE ANY THOSE BUT

02:45:23.046 --> 02:45:25.348
WE'RE LOOKING ATTHAT TOO- BUT

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:27.050
BASICALLY I THINK WE JUST SPENT

02:45:27.117 --> 02:45:29.919
ON. MAINTAINING AND BUILDING

02:45:29.986 --> 02:45:33.189
THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM. SO THE

02:45:33.256 --> 02:45:34.324
COME. BEING FROM SOUTHERN

02:45:34.391 --> 02:45:35.725
CALIFORNIA THE COMPLAINT I

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:37.260
HEARD THE MOST OFTEN WAS THAT.

02:45:37.327 --> 02:45:40.964
YOUR PS PS IS WERE. VERY BROAD

02:45:41.031 --> 02:45:45.068
THEY WEREN'T FOCUSED. COULD YOU

02:45:45.135 --> 02:45:45.669
EXPLAIN DEBT THAT ACCURATE OR

02:45:45.735 --> 02:45:48.071
CORRECT. ALL WILL START AND

02:45:48.138 --> 02:45:51.908
THEN I WILL. RELY ON MY AT MY

02:45:51.975 --> 02:45:53.576
EXPERT HERE THERE'S A COUPLE OF

02:45:53.643 --> 02:45:54.944
BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

02:45:55.011 --> 02:45:59.683
SYSTEMS. THE TRANSMISSION

02:45:59.749 --> 02:46:01.518
SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:46:01.584 --> 02:46:02.052
IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IN

02:46:02.118 --> 02:46:04.921
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:06.790
THE STAKES TAKING OUT

02:46:06.856 --> 02:46:09.492
TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS PIECES

02:46:09.559 --> 02:46:12.162
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO IMPACT

02:46:12.228 --> 02:46:12.796
A LOT MORE PEOPLE. SO WE HAVE A

02:46:12.862 --> 02:46:15.532
DIFFERENT SYSTEM. WE DON'T HAVE

02:46:15.598 --> 02:46:17.133
THE TEN YEARS OF SPECIFIC

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:18.968
WEATHER DATA THAT SDG AND HE

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:20.337
TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE GENERAL

02:46:20.403 --> 02:46:23.840
DATA- BUT I THINK THE

02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:24.641
DIFFERENCE IN THE SYSTEM REALLY

02:46:24.708 --> 02:46:27.043
ACCOUNTS FOR. THE SCOPE OF

02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:31.381
THESE EVENTS FOR THEM YES.

LIMITER AND THE WORK THAT WE'VE

02:46:45.929 --> 02:46:46.496
DONE IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS

SIX HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS

02:47:07.717 --> 02:47:09.586
WE'VE DONE A THIRTY YEAR.

02:47:09.652 --> 02:47:10.920
CLIMATOLOGY STUDY WE'VE-

02:47:10.987 --> 02:47:12.222
ESTABLISHED EIGHTY DIFFERENT

02:47:12.288 --> 02:47:14.057
BILLION DATA POINTS SO WE

02:47:14.124 --> 02:47:15.658
LEVERAGE NOW FOR THE PURPOSES

02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:18.428
OF WEATHER FORECASTING THAT

02:47:18.495 --> 02:47:20.964
DOES GIVE US A MORE TARGETED

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:23.666
AND GRANULAR VIEW- IN TERMS OF

02:47:23.733 --> 02:47:25.335
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE

02:47:25.402 --> 02:47:28.071
POTENTIAL A HIGH FIRE RISK-

02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:29.672
WILL GIVE YOU TWO DIFFERENT

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:31.374
DATA POINTS TO COMPARE SO IF

02:47:31.441 --> 02:47:32.742
YOU LOOK AT THE LARGEST EVENT

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:33.810
THAT WE HAD IN OCTOBER TWENTY

02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:36.546
SIXTH. WE HAD DONE NINE AND

02:47:36.613 --> 02:47:37.046
FORTY THOUSAND AND AGAIN

02:47:37.113 --> 02:47:38.848
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS- SO A LOT

02:47:38.915 --> 02:47:40.016
MORE CUSTOMERS THAT WERE

02:47:40.083 --> 02:47:42.352
IMPACTED IF YOU LOOK AT THE RED

02:47:42.419 --> 02:47:44.187
FLAG WARNING FOOTPRINT WITHIN

02:47:44.254 --> 02:47:45.922
THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SERVICE

02:47:45.989 --> 02:47:47.490
TERRITORY THAT WOULD HAVE

02:47:47.557 --> 02:47:49.893
AMOUNTED TO ABOUT TWO POINT TWO

02:47:49.959 --> 02:47:52.462
MILLION CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS SO WE

02:47:52.529 --> 02:47:54.798
DO LEVERAGE OUR INTERNAL

SERVICE SERVICE TERRITORY WE'RE

02:48:10.280 --> 02:48:11.514
LOOKING TO GET TO ABOUT A TWO

WEATHER FORECASTING CAPABILITY

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:22.926
AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO

02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:24.861
DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF WEATHER

02:48:24.928 --> 02:48:26.996

GO HAND IN HAND THE WEATHER

02:48:49.319 --> 02:48:49.719
STATIONS GIVE US THAT

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:50.653
ADDITIONAL GRANULARITY FOR

02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.255
FORECASTING BUT WE ALSO NEED

02:48:52.322 --> 02:48:54.257
THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY ON

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:55.959
OUR ELECTRICAL GRID SYSTEM TO

BE ABLE TO SECTIONAL EYES OUR

02:48:58.695 --> 02:49:00.396
SYSTEM ITSELF SO WE PUT A PLAN

02:49:00.463 --> 02:49:02.065
TOGETHER TO AUTOMATE OR

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:04.400
SOCIALIZE SEVEN HUNDRED AND

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.035
FIFTY DIFFERENT DEVICES ON OUR

02:49:06.102 --> 02:49:07.537
SYSTEM. OF INSTALLED MORE THAN

02:49:07.604 --> 02:49:10.306
TWO HUNDRED- THIS YEAR ALONE

02:49:10.373 --> 02:49:11.341
AND IN THE NEXT SIX TO NINE

02:49:11.407 --> 02:49:13.376
MONTHS WE PLAN TO INSTALL THE

02:49:13.443 --> 02:49:15.311
ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED AND

02:49:15.378 --> 02:49:17.213
FIFTY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO

02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:18.781
HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES

02:49:18.848 --> 02:49:21.150
THAT SHE- BENEFITS ABOUT

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:22.685
HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT

02:49:22.752 --> 02:49:23.653
THOUSAND CUSTOMERS MEANING THAT

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.522
IF WE HAVE A POTENTIAL PUBLIC

02:49:25.588 --> 02:49:27.457
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF OF AND WE

02:49:27.524 --> 02:49:29.826
CAN MAINTAIN SERVICE TO THE

02:49:29.893 --> 02:49:30.927
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:32.695
CUSTOMERS OF ALL OF THOSE TWO

02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:33.596
HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:35.565
ARE GOING TO BE IN PLAY. ADDING

02:49:35.632 --> 02:49:37.534
ANOTHER FIVE AND FIFTY DEVICES

02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:39.869
FOR THEIR- BENEFITS ABOUT THREE

02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:40.937
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND

02:49:41.004 --> 02:49:43.106
CUSTOMERS AND WE ACTUALLY SAW

02:49:43.172 --> 02:49:44.641
AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN THE

02:49:44.707 --> 02:49:46.075
OCTOBER NINTH EVENT WHEN WE DID

02:49:46.142 --> 02:49:47.977
HAVE AN IMPACT ABOUT SEVEN

02:49:48.044 --> 02:49:48.878
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

02:49:48.945 --> 02:49:51.047
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS. OF THE TWO

02:49:51.114 --> 02:49:52.382
HUNDRED SOCIALIZATION DEVICES

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:53.850
WE HAD IN PLACE WE WERE ABLE TO

02:49:53.917 --> 02:49:55.385
LEVERAGE SOME OF THOSE AND WE

02:49:55.451 --> 02:49:57.086
WERE ABLE TO STILL MAINTAIN

02:49:57.153 --> 02:49:59.422
SERVICE TO ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN

02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:00.123
THOUSAND CUSTOMERS SO THAT IS

02:50:00.189 --> 02:50:03.626
ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR STRATEGY

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:05.228
AND WERE ACCELERATING AND

02:50:05.295 --> 02:50:06.930
MOVING TO ACTION ON THAT. ON

02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:01.904
POPULATION AND I THINK THERE'S

02:58:01.971 --> 02:58:03.472
A PERCEPTION THAT SOME OF THE

02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:04.106
RESOURCES WENT TO MORE AFFLUENT

02:58:04.173 --> 02:58:06.876
COMMUNITIES. I'M NOT SUGGEST

THAT WAS YOUR INTENT BUT THAT'S

02:58:08.144 --> 02:58:10.312
THE PERCEPTION AND SO I WOULD

02:58:10.379 --> 02:58:12.181
JUST SUGGEST THAT IN PLANNING

02:58:12.248 --> 02:58:13.916
FOR THE FUTURE THEY'RE NOT BE A

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:16.152
DISPARITY IN COMMUNITIES THAT

02:58:16.218 --> 02:58:19.088
RECEIVE THE EMERGENCY RESOURCES

02:58:19.155 --> 02:58:22.191

THE SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN FIRE

03:01:21.103 --> 03:01:24.974
TRAGEDIES ARM WE READ ESTIMATES

03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:25.541
OF THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS OF

03:01:25.608 --> 03:01:28.143
LIABILITY. IF YOU COMPARE THAT

03:01:28.210 --> 03:01:32.248
TO THE. RESISTANCE TO

03:01:32.314 --> 03:01:35.884
UNDERGROUND WIRES EIGHT THE

03:01:35.951 --> 03:01:36.719
RULE OF THUMB IS TO BE A

03:01:36.785 --> 03:01:38.687
MILLION DOLLARS A MILE I KNOW

03:01:38.754 --> 03:01:39.288
IT'S PROBABLY HIGHER THAN THAT

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:42.324
NOW. IF YOU TAKE SEVENTY

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:44.727
THOUSAND MILES OF YOUR SERVICE

03:01:44.793 --> 03:01:47.363

YEAR OPENING STATEMENT. IF YOU

03:01:51.934 --> 03:01:52.468
UNDER GROUNDED ONE QUARTER OF

03:01:52.534 --> 03:01:55.971
THOSE. AND A MILLION DOLLAR

03:01:56.038 --> 03:01:57.539
SMILE IN THE HIGHEST RISK FIRE

03:01:57.606 --> 03:02:00.209
AREAS MY MATH SAYS THAT WOULD

03:02:00.276 --> 03:02:02.678
BE ABOUT FIFTEEN BILLION. SO

03:02:02.745 --> 03:02:05.014
THE THIRTY BILLION OF LIABILITY

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:06.048
YOU FACE NOW TO SAVE MONEY FOR

03:02:06.115 --> 03:02:09.018
SHAREHOLDERS. IF HALF THAT HAD

03:02:09.084 --> 03:02:09.618
BEEN INVESTED IN UNDER

03:02:09.685 --> 03:02:11.820
GROUNDING IN HIGH RISK AREAS

03:02:11.887 --> 03:02:13.155
YOU MIGHT HAVE LIMITED P.

03:02:13.222 --> 03:02:14.957
GENIES LEADERSHIP MIGHT HAVE

03:02:15.024 --> 03:02:17.026
LIMITED. THE CURRENT LIABILITY

03:02:17.092 --> 03:02:19.428
IT'S LOOKING AT NOW SO. AS WE

03:02:19.495 --> 03:02:21.063
MOVE FORWARD ARE BEGINNING

03:02:21.130 --> 03:02:22.431
CONTINUE TO HEAR THAT UNDER

03:02:22.498 --> 03:02:25.167
GROUNDING IS TOO EXPENSIVE OR

03:02:25.234 --> 03:02:27.469
WHAT TIPPING POINT DO DETERMINE

03:02:27.536 --> 03:02:29.705
THAT YES EXPENSIVE. BUT IN THE

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:31.707
LONG RUN IT'S THE RIGHT AND

03:02:31.774 --> 03:02:34.109
MEANT TO MAKE TO PROTECT

03:02:34.176 --> 03:02:36.345
AGAINST WHAT JERRY BROWN CALLED

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:39.348
THE NEW ABNORMAL. OF CLIMATE

03:02:39.415 --> 03:02:44.586
CHANGE NEXUS. TIRE FIRE.

03:02:44.653 --> 03:02:46.655
UNPRECEDENTED WINDOW VENTS AND

THE NEXUS WITH ELECTRIC POWER

03:02:47.323 --> 03:02:50.192
LINES. SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE

03:02:50.259 --> 03:02:52.494
THIS UNDER GROUNDING

03:02:52.561 --> 03:02:55.597
CONSIDERABLY MORE OF OUR SYSTEM.

03:02:55.664 --> 03:02:58.300
NOT BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY SO

03:02:58.367 --> 03:02:58.867
MUCH IS YOUR SINCE THE RIGHT

03:02:58.934 --> 03:02:59.335
THING TO DO GIVEN THE

03:02:59.401 --> 03:03:02.504
CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY'RE A COUPLE

03:03:02.571 --> 03:03:03.806
THINGS ABOUT OUR SYSTEM THAT

03:03:03.872 --> 03:03:05.674
ARE UNIQUE WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:07.509
AMOUNT OF SIXTY AND SEVENTY KV

03:03:07.576 --> 03:03:10.546
TRANSMISSION. AND A LOT OF

03:03:10.612 --> 03:03:12.214
LARGE TRANSMISSION THAT YOU

03:03:12.281 --> 03:03:14.917
CANNOT REALLY PUT UNDERGROUND.

03:03:14.983 --> 03:03:15.484
SO THIS IS REALLY LIMITED TO

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:18.754
DISTRIBUTION. AND THEN THE

03:03:18.821 --> 03:03:20.522
EQUATION WILL BE IS A BETTER

03:03:20.589 --> 03:03:23.692
UNDERGROUND IS A BETTER TO PUT

03:03:23.759 --> 03:03:25.094
COVERED HARDEN WIRE UP ALL

HIS ACTIVITY WILL BE DIRECTED

03:03:28.630 --> 03:03:30.866
TOWARD REDUCING THE RISK. IT

03:03:30.933 --> 03:03:33.168
WOULD SEEM IN THE LONG TERM FOR

03:03:33.235 --> 03:03:34.103

MILES OF LINE. HAS CRITICAL

03:07:20.896 --> 03:07:23.498
MILES A LINE EXIST. I

03:07:23.565 --> 03:07:25.367
UNDERSTAND MR SAYING IT'S BEEN

03:07:25.434 --> 03:07:27.436
WORKING WITH THE TEAM ON THAT.

03:07:27.502 --> 03:07:29.438
I BRING ALL THIS UP IS SO TEN

03:07:29.504 --> 03:07:31.773
YEARS YOU SAY IT'S GONNA TAKE

03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:32.374
TEN YEARS IS THAT SATISFACTORY

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:36.278
TO YOU. TO BE A MODERNIZE. OF

03:07:36.345 --> 03:07:38.413
NOTE IN THE ME FIRST CLARIFY

03:07:38.480 --> 03:07:40.816
WHAT IT IS I ACTUALLY SO. WHICH

03:07:40.882 --> 03:07:42.618
WAS A TEN YEAR PERIOD

03:07:42.684 --> 03:07:44.386
CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPERIENCE

03:07:44.453 --> 03:07:47.689
OF SDG AN EDISON TO GET TO A

03:07:47.756 --> 03:07:48.924
POINT WHERE THESE ARE ALMOST

03:07:48.991 --> 03:07:49.825
NONEXISTENT OR CERTAINLY

03:07:49.891 --> 03:07:52.661
SURGICAL- NO IT'S NOT

03:07:52.728 --> 03:07:53.962
ACCEPTABLE TO ME TO HAVE

03:07:54.029 --> 03:07:55.631
ANOTHER YEAR LIKE THIS ONE. BUT

03:07:55.697 --> 03:08:01.503
LONG KENNEDY'S TO WHAT IS THAT-MEAN FOR US WHO WERE SO IN MY

03:08:01.570 --> 03:08:04.539
NECK OF THE WOODS- AT OF THIRTY

03:08:04.606 --> 03:08:07.309
DAYS WE HAD FOR POWER OUTAGE.

03:08:07.376 --> 03:08:08.410
YOU SAY THAT. IN THE SYSTEM

03:08:08.477 --> 03:08:09.711
THERE IS NO MORE THAN FIVE DAYS

03:08:09.778 --> 03:08:11.813
YOU HAVE LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE

03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:13.482
HERE TODAY THAT WERE OUT FOR

03:08:13.548 --> 03:08:15.083
SIX OR SEVEN. SO I DON'T KNOW

03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.784
WHERE THAT INCONSISTENT COMES

03:08:15.851 --> 03:08:16.652
FROM BUT JUST BEING HONEST

03:08:16.718 --> 03:08:18.587
ABOUT IT- THIS IS TYPICAL FOR

03:08:18.654 --> 03:08:22.324
P. JEANNIE. THEY SAY ONE THNG

03:08:22.391 --> 03:08:23.191
AND REALLY THE REALITIES

03:08:23.258 --> 03:08:24.960
DIFFERENT. THERE ARE SOME

03:08:25.027 --> 03:08:27.129
ISOLATED COMMITTEES ARE OUT FOR

03:08:27.195 --> 03:08:29.398
ELEVEN. ELEVEN DAYS. SO I ASK

03:08:29.464 --> 03:08:35.237
YOU. WHAT WOULD BE A TIME LINE

03:08:35.303 --> 03:08:35.837
THAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY IF

03:08:35.904 --> 03:08:41.877
IT'S NOT TEN. WELL I THINK TEN

03:08:41.943 --> 03:08:44.446
IS A GOOD ONE STILL FOR VERY

03:08:44.513 --> 03:08:46.615
TARGETED LIMITED SMALL NUMBERS

03:08:46.682 --> 03:08:48.950
IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES I

03:08:49.017 --> 03:08:50.919
THINK WE NEED TO MAKE GREAT

03:08:50.986 --> 03:08:51.486
PROGRESS IN THE NEXT TWO OR

03:08:51.553 --> 03:08:54.856
THREE YEARS. AND SO MAYBE WE

03:08:54.923 --> 03:08:55.457
CAN TO FIVE TO GET TO A REALLY

03:08:55.524 --> 03:08:58.894
GOOD PLACE. BUT THE NEXT COUPLE

03:08:58.960 --> 03:08:59.961
OF THREE YEARS OLD THE CRUCIAL

03:09:00.028 --> 03:09:02.164
IN MY OPINION. I THINK ONE OF

03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:03.131
THE ISSUES AND I APPRECIATE

03:09:03.198 --> 03:09:04.966
THAT ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT I

03:09:05.033 --> 03:09:06.334
THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE THE

03:09:06.401 --> 03:09:09.237
ADMINISTRATION- NEED TO BRING

03:09:09.304 --> 03:09:10.839
FORTIES WE NEED A PERFORMANCE

03:09:10.906 --> 03:09:12.841
BASED- METRICS THAT ARE BUILT

03:09:12.908 --> 03:09:16.611
INTO LAW IF WE DO NOT HAVE

03:09:16.678 --> 03:09:18.180
THOSE PERFORMANCE METRICS BUILT

03:09:18.246 --> 03:09:19.381
INTO LAW. WE'RE GONNA BE

03:09:19.448 --> 03:09:21.416
SITTING HERE FIVE YEARS LATER

03:09:21.483 --> 03:09:22.250
HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION

03:09:22.317 --> 03:09:23.452
THAT'S WHAT I'M DEEPLY WORRIED

03:09:23.518 --> 03:09:25.087
ABOUT. BUT I DID TALK ABOUT

03:09:25.153 --> 03:09:26.488
ANOTHER ISSUE. TRANSMISSION

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:29.524
LINES WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:09:29.591 --> 03:09:30.092
APPRECIATE THE PHONE CALL IN

03:09:30.158 --> 03:09:32.194
REGARDS TO THE CAN KATE FIVE.

03:09:32.260 --> 03:09:35.697
THE TRANSPORTATION LANES. UP IN

03:09:35.764 --> 03:09:37.232
THE MAYACAMAS NEAR THE GEYSERS

03:09:37.299 --> 03:09:41.403
WEREN'T SHUT DOWN. SO WE HAD

03:09:41.470 --> 03:09:43.238
THE POWERSHOT OFFICE AND WE HAD

03:09:43.305 --> 03:09:46.408
A SECONDARY EMERGENCY- WHERE

03:09:46.475 --> 03:09:49.544
THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS CHALLENGE

03:09:49.611 --> 03:09:51.680
I WILL USE IN NON TECHNICAL

03:09:51.747 --> 03:09:52.247
TERM OF SOME TYPE OF SPARK.

03:09:52.314 --> 03:09:56.651
THAT BECAUSE THE FIRE TO START.

03:09:56.718 --> 03:09:57.486
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE AN ACTIVE

03:09:57.552 --> 03:09:59.521
INVESTIGATION SO I'M NOT GOING

03:09:59.588 --> 03:10:00.122
TO GOING TO THAT BUT I'D LIKE

03:10:00.188 --> 03:10:00.655
TO BE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

03:10:00.722 --> 03:10:02.958
THRESHOLDS MY UNDERSTANDING IS

03:10:03.024 --> 03:10:05.026
THAT YOU DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE

03:10:05.093 --> 03:10:06.661
SET SIZE TRANSMISSION LINES

03:10:06.728 --> 03:10:08.864
UNLESS THERE'S GOING TO BE

03:10:08.930 --> 03:10:09.464
SUSTAINED. FIFTY FIVE MILE PER

03:10:09.531 --> 03:10:13.535
HOUR WINDS. GUSTS STAY HERE

03:10:13.602 --> 03:10:16.471
OKAY SINGLE S. MY ISSUE WAS

03:10:16.538 --> 03:10:19.007
WITH THAT IS THAT CAL FIRE

03:10:19.074 --> 03:10:21.743
FORECASTS FOR THE MY COMMON

03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:24.112
THAT NIGHT. IN OTHER LOCAL

03:10:24.179 --> 03:10:25.514
FORECAST SHOWED THAT IN GAPS

03:10:25.580 --> 03:10:26.114
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT FIFTY

03:10:26.181 --> 03:10:28.350
FIVE MILES PER HOUR. IN FACT IN

03:10:28.416 --> 03:10:29.484
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT YOU SAID

03:10:29.551 --> 03:10:31.820
THAT- IN THE NORTH BAY WAS AT A

03:10:31.887 --> 03:10:33.221
HUNDRED AND TWO MILES PER HOUR

03:10:33.288 --> 03:10:34.990
AT THAT THE STRONG AS WE TAKE A

03:10:35.056 --> 03:10:36.424
LOOK AT MOUNT ST LENA WE LOOK

03:10:36.491 --> 03:10:37.559
AT THE MY COMMON MOUNTAINS.

03:10:37.626 --> 03:10:38.760
THERE ARE SUSTAIN GASES

03:10:38.827 --> 03:10:42.130
SEMINARY SEVENTY OR EIGHTY

03:10:42.197 --> 03:10:42.731
MILES PER HOUR. SO I'M TRYING

03:10:42.798 --> 03:10:44.633
TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE

03:10:44.699 --> 03:10:46.401
SHUTTING DOWN. ONE IN THE

03:10:46.468 --> 03:10:49.404
VALLEY. YET WHERE WE LOOK AT

03:10:49.471 --> 03:10:51.506
THESE FIRE STARTER HAPPENING UP

03:10:51.573 --> 03:10:53.141
IN THE MOUNTAINS WHY WEREN'T

03:10:53.208 --> 03:10:54.943
THOSE TRANSMISSION LINES TURN

03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:55.877
DOWN WE KNEW THAT THERE ARE

03:10:55.944 --> 03:10:57.479
MULTIPLE FORECAST THAT SETS A

03:10:57.546 --> 03:10:59.614
STAIN WIND OF OVER FIFTY FIVE.

03:10:59.681 --> 03:11:04.286
THAT'S A QUESTION. SECOND I CAN

03:11:04.352 --> 03:11:04.886
CHIME CHIME IN ON THE CENTER

03:11:04.953 --> 03:11:05.587
REQUIRE THANK YOU FOR THE

03:11:05.654 --> 03:11:08.056
QUESTION SO THE FIFTY FIVE MILE

03:11:08.123 --> 03:11:09.858
AN HOUR REFERENCE- IS NOT A

03:11:09.925 --> 03:11:11.960
BLANKET. FOR EVERY SINGLE

03:11:12.027 --> 03:11:14.763
TRANSMISSION LINE WE EVALUATE-

03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:16.198
EVERY SINGLE TRANSMISSION LINE

03:11:16.264 --> 03:11:17.899
TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS

03:11:17.966 --> 03:11:19.434
THAT APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD

03:11:19.501 --> 03:11:20.902
BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON. THE

03:11:20.969 --> 03:11:22.537
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE LINE

03:11:22.604 --> 03:11:23.371
IF IT'S ON A RIDGE LINE IF IT'S

03:11:23.438 --> 03:11:26.241
IN A WIN CORRIDOR. AND WE ALSO

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:29.044
LOOK AT THE- POTENTIAL. FOR

03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:30.512
FIRE SPREAD THE ASSOCIATE

03:11:30.579 --> 03:11:33.548
CONSEQUENCE AND ALSO THE IMPACT

03:11:33.615 --> 03:11:35.550
OF FROM A GRADE STABILITY

03:11:35.617 --> 03:11:36.551
PERCENT THEY HAVE BEEN THAT

03:11:36.618 --> 03:11:38.753
THIS WAS A HIGHER VOLTAGE- TO

03:11:38.820 --> 03:11:39.821
THIRTY KV LINE- THE FORECAST

03:11:39.888 --> 03:11:42.824
THAT WE HAD- PUT TOGETHER FROM

03:11:42.891 --> 03:11:43.992
A INTERNAL MAYBE ALL YOU

03:11:44.059 --> 03:11:47.095
PERSPECTIVE- DID NOT-

03:11:47.162 --> 03:11:48.330
NECESSARILY GET UP TO. YOU KNOW

03:11:48.396 --> 03:11:50.665
THAT THRESHOLD. WHICH WAS

03:11:50.732 --> 03:11:51.867
HIGHER THAN FIFTY FIVE MILES AN

03:11:51.933 --> 03:11:55.136
HOUR FOR THIS SPECIFIC LINE TO

03:11:55.203 --> 03:11:55.604
MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR

03:11:55.670 --> 03:12:01.009
DIGITIZATION. I AM PERPLEXED

03:12:01.076 --> 03:12:02.344
AND I'M NOT IN ENERGY EXPERT

03:12:02.410 --> 03:12:04.045
WHATSOEVER. BUT HERE'S WHAT

03:12:04.112 --> 03:12:05.847
I'LL SAY. YEAH SHUT DOWN. MY

03:12:05.914 --> 03:12:07.649
ARM ONE POINT SIX MILLION

03:12:07.716 --> 03:12:08.283
PEOPLE TO PEAK SOMEWHERE AROUND

03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:10.919
IN THERE GIVE OR TAKE. IF YOU

03:12:10.986 --> 03:12:12.254
LEAVE THESE TRANSMISSION LINES

03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:13.688
VETERAN FIRE CRITICAL ZONES. UP

03:12:13.755 --> 03:12:15.957
AND RUNNING AND IN FACT IN

03:12:16.024 --> 03:12:18.226
YEARS PAST YOU HAD SIGNIFICANT

03:12:18.293 --> 03:12:20.829
FIRE STARTS IN THAT SAME AREA.

03:12:20.896 --> 03:12:21.429
SO YOU KEEP THESE TRANSMISSION

03:12:21.496 --> 03:12:25.033
LINES OPEN. THERE IS A

03:12:25.100 --> 03:12:27.335
CATASTROPHIC EVENT ON ONE OF

03:12:27.402 --> 03:12:27.869
THE LINES INVESTIGATION IS

03:12:27.936 --> 03:12:30.338
STILL PENDING. AND THEN YOU

03:12:30.405 --> 03:12:31.373
HAVE THE LARGEST WHILE IN

03:12:31.439 --> 03:12:32.974
FOREIGN CINEMA COUNTY HISTORY

03:12:33.041 --> 03:12:34.676
BURNING DOWN HUNDRED SEVENTY

03:12:34.743 --> 03:12:35.243
FIVE HOMES INVESTIGATION SO

03:12:35.310 --> 03:12:39.014

IS- THE DATES A LOT OF US HERE

03:29:47.942 --> 03:29:49.076
AS WELL RIGHT SO IT'S SOMETHING

03:29:49.143 --> 03:29:50.477
THAT- WAS INHERITED AS PART OF

03:29:50.544 --> 03:29:52.513
A- THE INTEGRATION OF MULTIPLE.

03:29:52.579 --> 03:29:54.048
IN A UTILITIES AND WHEN YOU

03:29:54.114 --> 03:29:55.282
START LOOKING AT WHAT'S

03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:56.517
DIFFERENT BETWEEN OUR SERVICE

03:29:56.583 --> 03:29:59.620
TERRITORY. WE DO SEE A LOT OF

03:29:59.687 --> 03:30:02.022
LONG RADIO LINES THAT DO SERVE

03:30:02.089 --> 03:30:03.724
OF LOW DENSITY NON URBAN

03:30:03.791 --> 03:30:04.959
CUSTOMER MAKES IT WAS

03:30:05.025 --> 03:30:06.060
INTERESTING IS WHEN YOU START

03:30:06.126 --> 03:30:08.162
LOOKING AT THE RATIO. OF NUMBER

03:30:08.228 --> 03:30:09.730
OF CUSTOMERS EVEN THOUGH THE

03:30:09.797 --> 03:30:12.266
LARGEST TIRE YOU WITHIN THE

03:30:12.333 --> 03:30:14.702
STATE- WE HAVE THE LOWEST

03:30:14.768 --> 03:30:15.402
CUSTOMER DOWN. FOR DISTRICT

03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:17.137
DISTRIBUTION LIFESTYLE WELL AS

03:30:17.204 --> 03:30:18.572
A LOS CUSTOMER DENSITY PER

03:30:18.639 --> 03:30:19.173
TRANSMISSION LINES BECAUSE WE

03:30:19.239 --> 03:30:22.042
HAVE A LOT OF LONG RADIO LINES.

03:30:22.109 --> 03:30:23.377
THAT ARE TRAVERSING NOW THE

03:30:23.444 --> 03:30:25.212
HIGH FAR REST BRISK AREAS THAT

03:30:25.279 --> 03:30:29.083
ARE PROVIDING SERVICE- TO SOME

03:30:29.149 --> 03:30:32.953
LARGE COMMUNITIES AND WHAT

03:30:33.020 --> 03:30:37.925
TENDS TO HAPPEN IS. AS. PREVENT

03:30:37.992 --> 03:30:39.793
SEGMENTING IN AND- FOCUSING ON

03:30:39.860 --> 03:30:41.228
DE ENERGIZING THE- TO LINE

03:30:41.295 --> 03:30:41.862
THAT'S TRAVERSING THE HIGH FAR

03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:42.463
RISK AREA. THERE'S UNINTENDED

03:30:42.529 --> 03:30:43.397
CONSEQUENCES TO COMMUNITIES

03:30:43.464 --> 03:30:43.964
THAT DON'T HAVE A SECONDARY

03:30:44.031 --> 03:30:45.666
SUPPLY. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT

03:30:45.733 --> 03:30:47.201
I AS SPEAKING TO IN REGARDS TO

03:30:47.267 --> 03:30:48.802
WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS

03:30:48.869 --> 03:30:49.570
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT FROM

03:30:49.636 --> 03:30:51.538
THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR. IS

03:30:51.605 --> 03:30:52.573
IDENTIFYING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

03:30:52.639 --> 03:30:53.941
FOR DISTRIBUTED ENABLED.

03:30:54.008 --> 03:30:55.476
GENERATION MICRA QUITS TO BE

03:30:55.542 --> 03:30:57.544
ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT POTENTIAL

03:30:57.611 --> 03:30:59.646
SECONDARY SUPPLY IN SOME CASES-

03:30:59.713 --> 03:31:01.148
WE DON'T HAVE A BACK FEET WHERE

03:31:01.215 --> 03:31:03.350
WE CAN ACTUALLY- CONNECTED FROM

03:31:03.417 --> 03:31:04.985
ANOTHER CIRCUIT THAT MAY BE IN

03:31:05.052 --> 03:31:07.021
A LOWER FIRE RISK AREA. AND FOR

03:31:07.087 --> 03:31:09.323
THEIR SEGMENT THE CIRCUIT THAT

03:31:09.390 --> 03:31:10.290
WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON FROM

03:31:10.357 --> 03:31:14.294
A AT RISK PERSPECTIVE. AND WHAT

03:31:14.361 --> 03:31:14.795
REALLY TRANSPIRED ON THE

03:31:14.862 --> 03:31:17.865
OCTOBER NINTH OF AND. EVEN THE

03:31:17.931 --> 03:31:19.066
SCALE OF THE EVENT ABOUT SEVEN

03:31:19.133 --> 03:31:19.867
HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

03:31:19.933 --> 03:31:20.768
CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS WAS THE

03:31:20.834 --> 03:31:22.603
LARGEST- SHUT OFF EVENT THAT

03:31:22.669 --> 03:31:24.605
WAS DONE ON THE HISTORY OF P.

03:31:24.671 --> 03:31:26.140
JEANNIE. AS WE STARTED TO LOOK

03:31:26.206 --> 03:31:27.574
AT THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT

03:31:27.641 --> 03:31:29.810
WERE INVOLVED. IN THE SHUT OFF

03:31:29.877 --> 03:31:30.978
AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

03:31:31.045 --> 03:31:32.980
INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF THAT

03:31:33.047 --> 03:31:34.481
GREAT IT ENDED UP HAVING A

03:31:34.548 --> 03:31:36.216
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

03:31:36.283 --> 03:31:37.751
LOSING SOME CUSTOMERS EARLIER

03:31:37.818 --> 03:31:40.821
ON- IN A BAND THE AT RISK

03:31:40.888 --> 03:31:44.224
WHETHER- REALLY- REQUIRED AND

03:31:44.291 --> 03:31:46.360
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE

03:31:46.427 --> 03:31:48.162
FOCUSED ON. TO BE VERY SURGICAL

03:31:48.228 --> 03:31:49.196
ABOUT SO THAT WE CAN MITIGATE

03:31:49.263 --> 03:31:50.964
THOSE TYPES ISSUES BECAUSE THE

03:31:51.031 --> 03:31:52.332
POINTS YOU WERE MAKING. WERE

03:31:52.399 --> 03:31:53.967
COMPLETELY ALIGNED ON TO BE

03:31:54.034 --> 03:31:57.438
ABLE TO- MINIMIZE THE IMPACT TO

03:31:57.504 --> 03:31:58.772
OUR CUSTOMERS FOR MODERATION

03:31:58.839 --> 03:32:00.407
PERSPECTIVE. AND THAT'S TWO

03:32:00.474 --> 03:32:04.511
FOLD ONE IS TO BE ABLE TO- DE

03:32:04.578 --> 03:32:06.180
ENERGIZED AS CLOSE TO THE AT

03:32:06.246 --> 03:32:07.781
RISK WEATHER EVENT AT AND

03:32:07.848 --> 03:32:09.316
STARTING ABOUT AT RISK WEATHER

03:32:09.383 --> 03:32:10.918
EVENT AS POSSIBLE. AND THEN

03:32:10.984 --> 03:32:13.053
SECONDARILY AS THAT EVENT SIR

03:32:13.120 --> 03:32:15.222
PASSED IS THE SERVICE

03:32:15.289 --> 03:32:17.724
TERRITORY. IS TO BE ABLE TO DO

03:32:17.791 --> 03:32:18.325
THE RIGHT RATIO IN VERY VERY

03:32:18.392 --> 03:32:19.860
QUICKLY AND- THAT WE

03:32:19.927 --> 03:32:21.829
DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE DâN. FROM

03:32:21.895 --> 03:32:23.130
LAST YEAR I'LL GIVE YOU AN

03:32:23.197 --> 03:32:25.099
EXAMPLE THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY

03:32:25.165 --> 03:32:25.599
THOUSAND CUSTOMERS OVER

03:32:25.666 --> 03:32:31.205
INVOLVED IN THE OCTOBER. TWENTY

03:32:31.271 --> 03:32:31.805
EIGHTEEN EVENT. AND IT TOOK US

03:32:31.872 --> 03:32:34.808
NEARLY FIFTY ONE HOURS.

03:32:34.875 --> 03:32:35.976
RESTORATION TIME WHICH MEANS

03:32:36.043 --> 03:32:36.510
AFTER THE AT RISK WHETHER

03:32:36.577 --> 03:32:37.845
SUBSIDE. COMPARE THAT TO THE

03:32:37.911 --> 03:32:38.879
OCTOBER TWENTY SIXTH OF AND WE

03:32:38.946 --> 03:32:41.281
HAD NINE HUNDRED AND

03:32:41.348 --> 03:32:42.316
700-009-0040 THOUSAND CUSTOMER

03:32:42.382 --> 03:32:44.351
ACCOUNTS WE WERE ABLE TO DO

03:32:44.418 --> 03:32:45.786
THAT RESTORATION ON AVERAGE IN

03:32:45.853 --> 03:32:48.822
TWELVE HOURS SO A SIGNIFICANT

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:49.423
IN A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT AND

03:32:49.490 --> 03:32:54.261
THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS. I HEAR

03:32:54.328 --> 03:32:55.929
THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF

03:32:55.996 --> 03:32:57.197
THERE WAS NO WIND IN MANY OF

03:32:57.264 --> 03:32:59.500
THOSE AREAS. WHY DO YOU NEED TO

03:32:59.566 --> 03:33:01.301
GO BACK AND CHECK THE LINES. SO

03:33:01.368 --> 03:33:03.203
MAYBE IT ISN'T IT I HEAR THE

03:33:03.270 --> 03:33:05.272
ANSWER BUT I DON'T REALLY

03:33:05.339 --> 03:33:08.509
RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT ANSWER AS

03:33:08.575 --> 03:33:10.878
SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW REALLY

03:33:10.944 --> 03:33:13.013
RED YOUR RESONATES WITH ME

03:33:13.080 --> 03:33:15.215
KNOWING. WE ARE WHAT WE HAD ON

03:33:15.282 --> 03:33:19.486
THE GROUND. SO TO SERVE GOING

03:33:19.553 --> 03:33:21.588
HAVING THAT YOU'LL GO BACK AND

03:33:21.655 --> 03:33:24.124
CHECK THOSE LINES THE WIND

03:33:24.191 --> 03:33:27.461
SPEED. GOT A- HOUSE NOW. WAS IT

03:33:27.528 --> 03:33:28.061
AND THAT'S THAT'S PART OF OUR

03:33:28.128 --> 03:33:28.762
PROTOCOL SO THE LINES I DON'T

03:33:28.829 --> 03:33:29.329
MEET THAT THRESHOLD BUT ARE

03:33:29.396 --> 03:33:29.930
INCLUDED IN SCOPE AS A RESULT

03:33:29.997 --> 03:33:30.864
OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

03:33:30.931 --> 03:33:32.166
OF THE INTERCONNECTED NATURE OF

03:33:32.232 --> 03:33:33.534
THE GRADE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:34.935
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PART OF

03:33:35.002 --> 03:33:35.903
THE SLOPE. SO IN ESSENCE YOU'RE

03:33:35.969 --> 03:33:38.038
TRYING TO GET CREDIT. FOR

03:33:38.105 --> 03:33:39.673
GETTING THE POWER DOWN POWER

03:33:39.740 --> 03:33:42.142
BACK ON. A LOT QUICKER WHEN

03:33:42.209 --> 03:33:44.945
THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. SO I

03:33:45.012 --> 03:33:45.679
WOULD NATURALLY STATE THAT-

03:33:45.746 --> 03:33:47.181
CENTER BECAUSE THERE IS A

03:33:47.247 --> 03:33:49.750
SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON OUR

03:33:49.816 --> 03:33:51.385
RESTORATION CAPABILITIES IN

03:33:51.451 --> 03:33:53.687
REGARDS TO TRAINING DOING

03:33:53.754 --> 03:33:56.857
ACTIVE DRILLS- HAVING OUR TEAMS

03:33:56.924 --> 03:33:58.258
BECOME VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE

03:33:58.325 --> 03:33:59.426
CIRCUITS DOING BOOTS ON THE

03:33:59.493 --> 03:34:01.461
GROUND PATROLS- DURING THE

03:34:01.528 --> 03:34:03.096
EARLY PART OF THE YEAR AS WELL

03:34:03.163 --> 03:34:05.332
AS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDING. OUR

03:34:05.399 --> 03:34:06.900
AERIAL FLEET CAPABILITIES WE

03:34:06.967 --> 03:34:08.702
WENT FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT

03:34:08.769 --> 03:34:09.836
HELICOPTERS WE HAD LAST YEAR.

03:34:09.903 --> 03:34:12.206
TO MORE THAN FORTY. AT THE PEAK

03:34:12.272 --> 03:34:13.840
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GO TO- UP

03:34:13.907 --> 03:34:16.343
TO SEVENTY- INCLUSIVE OF

03:34:16.410 --> 03:34:18.212
WORKING WITH THE OUR CALLOW YES

03:34:18.278 --> 03:34:19.379
PARTNERS TO LEVERAGE. NIGHT

03:34:19.446 --> 03:34:21.381
PATROLLING CAPABILITIES THROUGH

03:34:21.448 --> 03:34:22.382
FIXED WING AND WE'RE LOOKING TO

03:34:22.449 --> 03:34:24.284
MAKE THAT PART OF OUR CURIOUSLY

03:34:24.351 --> 03:34:24.918
CAPABILITIES WE HAVE A

03:34:24.985 --> 03:34:26.787
SIGNIFICANT FOCUS. ON THE

03:34:26.853 --> 03:34:27.921
OPERATION SIDE FROM A

03:34:27.988 --> 03:34:29.122
RESTORATION PERSPECTIVE WOULD

03:34:29.189 --> 03:34:33.727
REALLY CAME TO BEAR AS WELL. I

03:34:33.794 --> 03:34:34.328
ACCEPT AND RESPECT THAT THANK

03:34:34.394 --> 03:34:37.431
YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

03:34:37.497 --> 03:34:40.000
THANK YOU MY COLLEAGUES WERE

03:34:40.067 --> 03:34:44.838
ACTUALLY RATHER POLITE THE.

03:34:44.905 --> 03:34:45.439
MANY OF US WERE SITTING AT THE

03:34:45.505 --> 03:34:48.308
DíAS REPRESENT. YOUR SERVICE

03:34:48.375 --> 03:34:52.246
TERRITORY AND. GRANTED IT IS

03:34:52.312 --> 03:34:53.814
FAR MORE COMPLICATED IT IS

03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:56.450
LARGER IT IS MORE CUSTOMERS

03:34:56.516 --> 03:34:58.118
GEOGRAPHICALLY PHENOMENALLY

03:34:58.185 --> 03:35:01.888
LARGER TOPOGRAPHICALLY- THERE

03:35:01.955 --> 03:35:04.791
SO MANY SO MANY FACTORS SO.

03:35:04.858 --> 03:35:06.693
THAT IT IS MORE COMPLICATED I

03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:08.161
DON'T THINK ANY OF US UNDER

03:35:08.228 --> 03:35:13.267
ESTIMATE BY. YOU HAVE HAD

03:35:13.333 --> 03:35:14.668
WHETHER THEY WERE ADEQUATE OR

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:17.271
NOT YOU HAVE HAD THE ABILITY

03:35:17.337 --> 03:35:18.872
OVER ALL OF THIS TIME AND I'M

03:35:18.939 --> 03:35:20.507
NOT JUST TALKING THE LAST THREE

03:35:20.574 --> 03:35:21.875
YEARS OF FIRES BECAUSE WE

03:35:21.942 --> 03:35:23.910
DIDN'T NEED THE LAST THREE

03:35:23.977 --> 03:35:25.846
YEARS OF FIRES THAT WE ARE IN A

03:35:25.912 --> 03:35:27.514
VERY HIGH FIRE DANGER AREA.

03:35:27.581 --> 03:35:30.584
STANLEY MORE. PERMITTED NOW BUT

03:35:30.651 --> 03:35:32.319
EVEN DURING THE DROUGHT. WE

03:35:32.386 --> 03:35:34.154
KNEW THAT WE WERE A GREAT FIRE

03:35:34.221 --> 03:35:36.356
RISK THAT ENTIRE TIME. AND

03:35:36.423 --> 03:35:38.592
CERTAINLY THE US EMBRATEL

03:35:38.659 --> 03:35:39.993
INCIDENT WAS MANY YEARS PRIOR

03:35:40.060 --> 03:35:42.663
SO THE ISSUE OF HAVING RATES TO

03:35:42.729 --> 03:35:45.966
COVER. THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF

03:35:46.033 --> 03:35:48.869
UTILITY FOR SAFETY MAINTENANCE

03:35:48.935 --> 03:35:51.138
AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. YOU

03:35:51.204 --> 03:35:52.673
HAVE THEM AT LEAST YOU HAD THAT

03:35:52.739 --> 03:35:55.242
WHICH YOU MORE ASKED FOR NOW IF

03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:57.477
YOU NEEDED MORE. THERE IS NOT

03:35:57.544 --> 03:35:59.379
BUT WE DON'T HAVE WE'RE NOT

03:35:59.446 --> 03:36:00.781
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL

03:36:00.847 --> 03:36:02.149
THAT YOU NEED MORE. AND

03:36:02.215 --> 03:36:05.485
CERTAINLY OUR CUSTOMERS RATES

03:36:05.552 --> 03:36:08.155
ARE QUITE HIGH. AND YET. AT I

03:36:08.221 --> 03:36:10.757
THINK THAT I CAN SAY. WITHOUT

03:36:10.824 --> 03:36:12.826
SPEAKING OUT OF TURN. THAT OUR

03:36:12.893 --> 03:36:15.829
CONSTITUENTS HAVE NO MORE

03:36:15.896 --> 03:36:19.833
CONFIDENCE. IT IS UTILITY. AND

03:36:19.900 --> 03:36:23.370
DATE. HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

03:36:23.437 --> 03:36:24.237
RESPECT FOR THE COMPANY NOW I

03:36:24.304 --> 03:36:25.405
DON'T WANT TO GO INTO GREAT

03:36:25.472 --> 03:36:27.174
MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE

03:36:27.240 --> 03:36:28.975
AS MR MORNING SENATOR MORNING

03:36:29.042 --> 03:36:31.878
SHARED. I DON'T WANT THE P.

03:36:31.945 --> 03:36:33.714
JEANNIE WORKERS TO FEEL THE

03:36:33.780 --> 03:36:38.151
WRATH OF. THE A RATE PAYERS

03:36:38.218 --> 03:36:39.486
WHEN THEY ARE SO FRUSTRATED

03:36:39.553 --> 03:36:41.955
WITH THIS IT IS NOT FAIR FOR

03:36:42.022 --> 03:36:45.025
RIGHT TO TAKE IT OUT ON THOSE

03:36:45.092 --> 03:36:48.628
WORKERS- AND YOU ARE BOTH NEW.

03:36:48.695 --> 03:36:50.430
BUT WE'RE STILL IN A

03:36:50.497 --> 03:36:52.999
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE. WE ARE

03:36:53.066 --> 03:36:56.203
BEING TOLD AS WAS JUST SENT TO

03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:57.771
MISTER REQUIRE AND SENATOR

03:36:57.838 --> 03:36:59.272
REQUIRED SENATOR DODD THEY

03:36:59.339 --> 03:37:01.241
COULD BE TEN YEARS THAT IS JUST

03:37:01.308 --> 03:37:03.777
NOT ACCEPTABLE SO I GUESS I'LL

03:37:03.844 --> 03:37:06.813
ALL I ASK IS. ARE YOU WILLING

03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:09.549
TO REVISE YOUR HARDENING AND

03:37:09.616 --> 03:37:15.288
RESILIENCY PLAN SO THAT YOU CAN.

03:37:15.355 --> 03:37:16.356
IT'S VERY PROMPTLY SO THAT YOU

03:37:16.423 --> 03:37:17.758
CAN EVALUATE THE BEST AVAILABLE

03:37:17.824 --> 03:37:20.227
CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES. THAT ARE

03:37:20.293 --> 03:37:21.695
MOST COST EFFECTIVE BECAUSE

03:37:21.762 --> 03:37:23.397
CLEARLY UNDER GROUNDING AS WE

03:37:23.463 --> 03:37:25.632
KNOW IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND I'M

03:37:25.699 --> 03:37:27.501
NOT SAYING WE SHOULD NOT

03:37:27.567 --> 03:37:28.969
UNDERGROUND I'M JUST SAYING

03:37:29.035 --> 03:37:30.771
THAT IF WE PLAN IF THAT'S OUR

03:37:30.837 --> 03:37:32.973
PRIMARY. THAT'LL TAKE FOREVER

03:37:33.039 --> 03:37:35.008
CERTAINLY VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

03:37:35.075 --> 03:37:37.277
SIMILARLY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE

03:37:37.344 --> 03:37:38.412
OF THE REGION AND THE DROUGHTS

03:37:38.478 --> 03:37:40.080
AND THE TYPE OF VEGETATION

03:37:40.147 --> 03:37:42.516
THAT. IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT

03:37:42.582 --> 03:37:44.251
SOME OF THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

03:37:44.317 --> 03:37:45.252
THAT WE HEARD THE OTHER

03:37:45.318 --> 03:37:48.488
UTILITIES. UTILIZING THAT ARE

03:37:48.555 --> 03:37:50.991
NOT UTILIZED IN THE SAME LEVEL

03:37:51.057 --> 03:37:53.994
BY P. JEANNIE. YOU KNOW I THINK

03:37:54.060 --> 03:37:55.328
THAT ALL OF US WOULD EXPECT TO

03:37:55.395 --> 03:37:59.166
SEE A REVISION. TO HAVE SOME

03:37:59.232 --> 03:38:01.768
IMMEDIATE RESULTS WITH THE

03:38:01.835 --> 03:38:03.837
CHEAPER COST EFFECTIVE CONTROL

03:38:03.904 --> 03:38:05.472
TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN ALSO BE

03:38:05.539 --> 03:38:06.907
IMPLEMENTED MUCH FASTER BECAUSE

03:38:06.973 --> 03:38:08.108
NOT ONLY IS UNDERGROUND

03:38:08.175 --> 03:38:11.278
EXPENSIVE IT TAKES A LONG TIME

03:38:11.344 --> 03:38:11.878
SO HOW CAN WE GET RESULTS MUCH

03:38:11.945 --> 03:38:15.315
FASTER. WELL THE SHORT ANSWER

03:38:15.382 --> 03:38:16.850
TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES

03:38:16.917 --> 03:38:19.186
ABSOLUTELY WE'RE WILLING TO

03:38:19.252 --> 03:38:19.653
LOOK AT OTHER THINGS

03:38:19.719 --> 03:38:22.322
ACCELERATE- WE HAVE DONE A

03:38:22.389 --> 03:38:24.191
NUMBER OF THINGS WE OF HE THE

03:38:24.257 --> 03:38:26.293
RESEARCHER STOLEN SHAMELESSLY

03:38:26.359 --> 03:38:27.260
FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE

03:38:27.327 --> 03:38:29.029
SOUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

03:38:29.095 --> 03:38:30.564
AND IN FACT WERE ALREADY

03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:33.667
TALKING ABOUT- DO WE HAVE THE

03:38:33.733 --> 03:38:36.002
RIGHT THINGS IN THE RIGHT AWAY.

03:38:36.069 --> 03:38:37.103
WE NEED TO SWITCH FROM

03:38:37.170 --> 03:38:38.538
SOMETHING TO MORE HARDENING.

03:38:38.605 --> 03:38:40.440
AND SO YEAH WE'RE LOOKING FOR

03:38:40.507 --> 03:38:43.143
THE BEST SOLUTION AIR AND NOT

03:38:43.210 --> 03:38:44.211
MARRIED TO THE ONE WE HAVE

03:38:44.277 --> 03:38:46.880
ABSOLUTELY. WELL I THINK THAT

03:38:46.947 --> 03:38:49.549
ALL OF US WOULD EXPECT TO SEE.

03:38:49.616 --> 03:38:51.151
AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE BUT

03:38:51.218 --> 03:38:53.353
DONE WELL A REVISION TWO YEAR

03:38:53.420 --> 03:38:56.456
PLAN THAT REFLECTS THAT- I ALSO

03:38:56.523 --> 03:39:01.761
IN. TO ECHO SENATOR MAGUIRE'S.

03:39:01.828 --> 03:39:02.929
THE WAY I DESCRIBE THE

03:39:02.996 --> 03:39:05.198
CIRCUMSTANCE WAS FIRST I AM

03:39:05.265 --> 03:39:08.802
VERY VERY. RELIEVED THAT WE DID

03:39:08.869 --> 03:39:11.638
NOT HAVE DEATHS IN THE NORTHERN

03:39:11.705 --> 03:39:13.306
CALIFORNIA FIRE SEASON STARTS

03:39:13.373 --> 03:39:16.943
FAR. BUT WE CAN'T CREATED

03:39:17.010 --> 03:39:19.546
DISASTER TO AVERTED DISASTER

03:39:19.613 --> 03:39:22.048
AND IN THIS NEXT SET OF POWER

03:39:22.115 --> 03:39:24.384
OUTAGES WE DO KNOW THAT THERE

03:39:24.451 --> 03:39:25.585
ARE ESTIMATES OF THE

03:39:25.652 --> 03:39:27.287
TEMPERATURE DROPS TO THIRTY

03:39:27.354 --> 03:39:29.689
SEVEN DEGREES AND THERE ARE

03:39:29.756 --> 03:39:31.224
VERY FEW HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE

03:39:31.291 --> 03:39:34.060
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE

03:39:34.127 --> 03:39:37.364
AFTER A COUPLE OF NIGHTS. OF NO

03:39:37.430 --> 03:39:39.966
HEAT AT THIRTY SEVEN DEGREES

03:39:40.033 --> 03:39:41.768
NOW CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE

03:39:41.835 --> 03:39:44.504
THEIR HEAT THROUGH NATURAL GAS

03:39:44.571 --> 03:39:46.106
AND PERHAPS IT DOESN'T AFFECT

03:39:46.172 --> 03:39:48.241
BUT THERE'S OFTEN EVEN THE BILL

03:39:48.308 --> 03:39:50.010
WOULD BE TO TURN IT ON THAT IS

03:39:50.076 --> 03:39:53.680
THEN ELECTRICALLY CONNECTED SO.

03:39:53.747 --> 03:39:59.252
WE I THINK WE REALLY. WE CAN'T

03:39:59.319 --> 03:40:01.922
AFFORD TO HAVE ANY DEATHS INTO

03:40:01.988 --> 03:40:05.992
HERE. I APPRECIATE RED RED

03:40:06.059 --> 03:40:07.561
CROSS MAY HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF

03:40:07.627 --> 03:40:08.995
PROTOCOLS BUT THEN YOU CAN'T

03:40:09.062 --> 03:40:10.163
RELY ON THEM YOU'RE GOING TO

03:40:10.230 --> 03:40:11.598
HAVE TO SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE

03:40:11.665 --> 03:40:14.868
WE CANNOT HAVE ANY DEATHS IN

03:40:14.935 --> 03:40:17.003
ANY OF THE AREAS BY ANY OTHER

03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:19.673
CUSTOMERS WHERE THIS NEXT.

03:40:19.739 --> 03:40:27.647
POWER OUTAGE IS SET UP. I THANK

03:40:27.714 --> 03:40:28.982
YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN-

03:40:29.049 --> 03:40:29.516
I AND MY COLLEAGUES HAVE

03:40:29.583 --> 03:40:31.918
COVERED IT. QUITE WELL IN TERMS

03:40:31.985 --> 03:40:34.487
OF THE ISSUES WITH- THE

03:40:34.554 --> 03:40:35.689
INFRASTRUCTURE ON WITH THE

03:40:35.755 --> 03:40:37.057
BLACKOUTS AMERICAN REPEAT THAT

03:40:37.123 --> 03:40:41.261
I WANT TO FOCUS ON- HOW WE HAVE

03:40:41.328 --> 03:40:42.729
MORE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES.

03:40:42.796 --> 03:40:50.003
DURING. FOUR FIVE SIX TEN YEARS

03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:52.672
WHATEVER IT IS THAT P. GINNY.

03:40:52.739 --> 03:40:54.808
SO FIRST WHAT WOULD YOU DO YOU

03:40:54.874 --> 03:40:57.811
AGREE WITH ME. ON THAT- CLEAN

03:40:57.877 --> 03:41:00.280
ENERGY STORAGE IS PREFERABLE TO

03:41:00.347 --> 03:41:02.315
DIESEL GENERATORS IN TERMS OF

03:41:02.382 --> 03:41:05.719
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO HAVE POWER

03:41:05.785 --> 03:41:08.822
DURING A BLACKOUT. YES OKAY. SO

03:41:08.888 --> 03:41:14.494
BY. WHO CAN I WANT TO ASK YOU

03:41:14.561 --> 03:41:17.631
THAT WOULD GIVEN NINE. AND WE

03:41:17.697 --> 03:41:19.733
NEED A LOT MORE PEOPLE AND

03:41:19.799 --> 03:41:22.135
BUSINESSES TO HAVE ENERGY

03:41:22.202 --> 03:41:22.702
STORAGE. IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

03:41:22.769 --> 03:41:27.173
AGREE WITH THAT. I AGREE

03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:27.741
GENERALLY WITH THAT I DON'T

03:41:27.807 --> 03:41:29.142
KNOW WHAT THE PENETRATION IS

03:41:29.209 --> 03:41:31.945
AN- ABOUT PRETTY MUCH CONSUMED

03:41:32.012 --> 03:41:35.649
WITH BANKRUPTCY AND WILDFIRES I

03:41:35.715 --> 03:41:36.216
DON'T I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO

03:41:36.282 --> 03:41:37.917
KNOW THAT I WILL TELL. THAT WE

03:41:37.984 --> 03:41:40.487
WOULD BE ACHIEVED A DECENT.

03:41:40.553 --> 03:41:42.389
JOHNS ON ON SOLAR- BUT ENERGY

03:41:42.455 --> 03:41:44.257
STORAGE IS WAY BEHIND IN PART

03:41:44.324 --> 03:41:46.393
BECAUSE TECHNOLOGIES NEWER-

03:41:46.459 --> 03:41:48.428
IT'S- MORE EXPENSIVE ALL THE

03:41:48.495 --> 03:41:51.197
COSTS ARE COMING DOWN- AND ONE

03:41:51.264 --> 03:41:53.199
OF THE REASONS ONE OF THE WAYS

03:41:53.266 --> 03:41:54.567
THAT WE GET THE COST TO COME

03:41:54.634 --> 03:41:55.969
DOWN AND GET THE PENETRATION TO

03:41:56.036 --> 03:41:58.204
HAPPEN. IS TO DO WHAT WE DID

03:41:58.271 --> 03:41:59.039
WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOLAR

03:41:59.105 --> 03:42:01.541
INITIATIVE WHICH WAS TO HAVE A

03:42:01.608 --> 03:42:04.310
REBATE PROGRAM- AND WE HAVE A

03:42:04.377 --> 03:42:06.479
PROGRAM NOW- CALLED THE AFTER

03:42:06.546 --> 03:42:09.215
PROGRAM- AND WE ARE PASSED

03:42:09.282 --> 03:42:12.886
SENATE BILL SEVEN HUNDRED ODD

03:42:12.952 --> 03:42:13.486
LAST YEAR. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

03:42:13.553 --> 03:42:16.756
IT. WHICH CREATES A REBATE

03:42:16.823 --> 03:42:18.324
PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS FOR

03:42:18.391 --> 03:42:20.827
BUSINESS SAYS FOR SCHOOLS FOR-

03:42:20.894 --> 03:42:23.897
WHOEVER ELSE TO TRY TO. MAKE IT

03:42:23.963 --> 03:42:24.864
MORE AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE TO

03:42:24.931 --> 03:42:26.766
INSTALL ENERGY STORAGE IN

03:42:26.833 --> 03:42:28.501
ADDITION BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT

03:42:28.568 --> 03:42:31.071
WAS AT THE SEVEN YEAR PROGRAM.

03:42:31.137 --> 03:42:32.706
IT CREATES CERTAINTYFOR THE

03:42:32.772 --> 03:42:35.375
INDUSTRY- THAT THIS REBATE

03:42:35.442 --> 03:42:37.077
PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE AROUND A

03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:39.913
DOZEN VERY EVERY YEAR. THAT WE

03:42:39.979 --> 03:42:41.314
KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IS THERE

03:42:41.381 --> 03:42:43.917
AND IT WILL BE THERE- AND SO

03:42:43.983 --> 03:42:46.152
THEY WILL INVEST AND INNOVATE.

03:42:46.219 --> 03:42:48.788
TAB BETTER AND BETTER STORAGE

03:42:48.855 --> 03:42:50.790
TECHNOLOGY AND TO CONTINUE TO

03:42:50.857 --> 03:42:52.292
BRING THE COST DOWN SO THE ONE

03:42:52.358 --> 03:42:54.594
BLACKOUTS HAPPEN PEOPLE CAN

03:42:54.661 --> 03:42:55.795
HAVE THE STORAGE WITHOUT HAVING

03:42:55.862 --> 03:42:59.666
TO BURN A DIESEL- SO I GUESS MY

03:42:59.733 --> 03:43:01.134
QUESTION IS IN THOUGHTS PRICING

03:43:01.201 --> 03:43:02.268
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME OF

03:43:02.335 --> 03:43:04.104
RECESSION. IN THIS HEARING-

03:43:04.170 --> 03:43:05.705
THAT P. GINNY IN ADDITION TO

THE OTHER I'LL USE IS CURRENTLY

03:43:07.707 --> 03:43:09.409
ASKING A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

03:43:09.476 --> 03:43:12.178
UTILITIES COMMISSION NOT TO

03:43:12.245 --> 03:43:14.047
PUBLICLY FIND A SEASON NOT TO

03:43:14.114 --> 03:43:16.616
FULLY FUND. THE AFTER PROGRAM-

03:43:16.683 --> 03:43:18.084
NO EDISON THOSE TAKEN THE

03:43:18.151 --> 03:43:19.452
POSITION THAT IT NEEDS TO BE

03:43:19.519 --> 03:43:20.954
POINTED SINCE TWO YEARS AT A

03:43:21.020 --> 03:43:22.889
TIME WHICH IS COMPLETELY

03:43:22.956 --> 03:43:24.824
DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A

03:43:24.891 --> 03:43:27.761
SEVEN YEAR. PERIOD P. GINNY HAS

03:43:27.827 --> 03:43:30.864
TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE-

03:43:30.930 --> 03:43:31.698
BECAUSE THERE'S A THERE'S A

03:43:31.765 --> 03:43:34.167
SURPLUS IN THE FUND RIGHT NOW.

03:43:34.234 --> 03:43:36.369
WHICH IS PRECISELY BECAUSE OF

03:43:36.436 --> 03:43:37.804
THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE

03:43:37.871 --> 03:43:41.508
FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM- AND SO-

03:43:41.574 --> 03:43:44.778
THAT'S WHY THIS- SURPLUS HAS

03:43:44.844 --> 03:43:46.446
ACCUMULATED I AM CONFIDENT THAT

03:43:46.513 --> 03:43:48.381
THE SURPLUS WILL BE UTILIZED

03:43:48.448 --> 03:43:50.150
OVERTIME. P. GINNY HAS TAKEN

03:43:50.216 --> 03:43:51.317
THE POSITION THAT THE

03:43:51.384 --> 03:43:54.020
COMMISSION SHOULD QUOTE RESPOND

03:43:54.087 --> 03:43:56.289

ALLOCATING MAP AND TOWARDS IT-

03:44:00.860 --> 03:44:02.495
AND SO IN OTHER WORDS AND THE

03:44:02.562 --> 03:44:04.063
OUT THE FINE EITHER BY REDUCING

03:44:04.130 --> 03:44:16.643
PEOPLES- BILLS OR- OR- WHATEVER.

03:44:16.709 --> 03:44:18.211
FOR LESS THAN FULL FUNDING OF

03:44:18.278 --> 03:44:19.813
YESTER PROGRAM I THINK THAT IT

03:44:19.879 --> 03:44:22.148
IS IN P. GINNY'S INTEREST AND

03:44:22.215 --> 03:44:23.783
IS IN EVERYONE'S INTEREST TO

03:44:23.850 --> 03:44:25.819
HAVE MORE ENERGY STORAGE OF THE

03:44:25.885 --> 03:44:26.986
PEOPLE CAN KEEP THEIR LIGHTS

03:44:27.053 --> 03:44:29.355
ON. AND SO I WANT TO ASK YOU IS

03:44:29.422 --> 03:44:31.624
P. GINNY OPENED TO ACTUALLY

03:44:31.691 --> 03:44:33.259
SUPPORTING FULL FUNDING OF THIS

03:44:33.326 --> 03:44:36.362
PROGRAM A PROGRAM THAT WAS

03:44:36.429 --> 03:44:36.963
CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND

03:44:37.030 --> 03:44:38.832
SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. SO THE

03:44:38.898 --> 03:44:40.200
SECOND TIME YOU ASKED THE

03:44:40.266 --> 03:44:42.969
QUESTION TODAY I LEANED OVER TO

03:44:43.036 --> 03:44:43.570
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND SAID

03:44:43.636 --> 03:44:44.204
I'M PROBABLY GOING TO GET ASKED

03:44:44.270 --> 03:44:46.239
THIS QUESTION. AND THEN I GOT

03:44:46.306 --> 03:44:48.341
CALLED UP HERE BEFORE I GOT THE

03:44:48.408 --> 03:44:51.911
ANSWER. SO I'M WILLING. TO LOOK

03:44:51.978 --> 03:44:53.012
AT ANYTHING AND THINK ABOUT

03:44:53.079 --> 03:44:54.781
ANYTHING I CAN I DON'T HAVE

03:44:54.848 --> 03:44:56.616
ENOUGH BACKGROUND TO ANSWER

03:44:56.683 --> 03:44:57.984
EXACTLY WHAT YOU ASKED BUT I'M

03:44:58.051 --> 03:45:00.086
CERTAINLY WILLING TO. THINK

03:45:00.153 --> 03:45:00.820
ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT IT COME

03:45:00.887 --> 03:45:02.922
VISIT WITH YOU ABOUT IT. I

03:45:02.989 --> 03:45:04.891
THINK THAT IT WOULD CREATE AN

03:45:04.958 --> 03:45:07.093
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GOOD WILL-

03:45:07.160 --> 03:45:10.063
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE-

03:45:10.129 --> 03:45:11.764
IF THE UTILITIES IMPEACHING IN

03:45:11.831 --> 03:45:14.367
PARTICULAR- WERE TO YOU KNOW.

03:45:14.434 --> 03:45:16.369
REALLY SUPPORT BEFORE FUNDING

03:45:16.436 --> 03:45:17.303
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE

03:45:17.370 --> 03:45:18.438
BECAUSE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A

03:45:18.504 --> 03:45:19.806
SMART INDIVIDUALS HOMES IS

03:45:19.873 --> 03:45:22.609
ABOUT BUSINESSES ABOUT SCHOOLS

03:45:22.675 --> 03:45:25.745
IT'S ABOUT- FARMERS. NONE WHO

03:45:25.812 --> 03:45:27.547
ARE LOSING THEIR CROPS AND WANT

03:45:27.614 --> 03:45:28.615
TO BEGENERATE THEIR OWN OUR IN

03:45:28.681 --> 03:45:30.283
STORE IT SO I WOULD REALLY

03:45:30.350 --> 03:45:31.918
ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER

03:45:31.985 --> 03:45:33.286
WORKING WITH US AND- I ALSO

03:45:33.353 --> 03:45:35.355
JUST GOING MORE BROADLY. WE'VE

03:45:35.421 --> 03:45:37.190
HAD A NUMBER OF FIGHTS AGAIN

03:45:37.257 --> 03:45:38.358
THIS IS NOT SAYS P. GINNY IT'S

03:45:38.424 --> 03:45:41.761
WITH THE UTILITIES AND- WITH-

03:45:41.828 --> 03:45:43.796
SOMETIMES OTHERS. ON ABOUT-

03:45:43.863 --> 03:45:46.399
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE-

03:45:46.466 --> 03:45:48.801
PROGRAMS AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR

03:45:48.868 --> 03:45:50.370
PEOPLE TO INSTALL THE AND I

03:45:50.436 --> 03:45:52.005
UNDERSTAND THAT THE UTILITIES

03:45:52.071 --> 03:45:54.507
HAVE A HISTORICALLY REFLEXIVELY

03:45:54.574 --> 03:45:56.476
OPPOSE THAT AND SEEN AS SOME

03:45:56.542 --> 03:45:58.411
SORT OF THREAT- BUT AGAIN I

03:45:58.478 --> 03:45:59.979
THINK. NOW WITH EVERYTHING

03:46:00.046 --> 03:46:01.147
THAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE

03:46:01.214 --> 03:46:06.352
AND THAT WILL BE HAPPENING.

03:46:06.419 --> 03:46:06.920
UNFORTUNATELY IT APPEARS FOR

03:46:06.986 --> 03:46:12.292
AWHILE. WE GOTTA HAVE MORE DVRS

03:46:12.358 --> 03:46:14.127

MOST IMPORTANTLY IN THIS CASE

04:10:15.767 --> 04:10:18.103
THE INABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET

04:10:36.988 --> 04:10:38.456
VERY FRUSTRATING LOOP OF

RELATIVELY SMALL. THIS IS

04:32:21.124 --> 04:32:22.392
LARGELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

PERIOD THE OVERALL IMPACT IS

04:32:48.952 --> 04:32:50.687
LIKELY TO BE SMALL. HAVING SAID

AROUND ANXIETY FROM BUSINESSES

04:32:57.961 --> 04:32:59.362

BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY AND

04:33:19.649 --> 04:33:20.217
OFTEN MORE THAN NOT TO NOT HAVE

04:33:20.283 --> 04:33:23.553
ANY BACK UP. POWER IN ON TOP OF

04:33:23.620 --> 04:33:24.788

04:52:35.838 --> 04:52:37.206
OUTAGE SOME OF MY DISTRICT IS

04:52:37.273 --> 04:52:38.207
AFFECTED BY THE OUTAGES AND AT

04:52:38.274 --> 04:52:39.074
THE SAME TIME WE HAD A

04:52:39.141 --> 04:52:40.576
REFINERY- DEPOT FIRE WITH AYE

04:52:40.643 --> 04:52:42.645
ET CLOSE FROM BOTH SIDES AND

04:52:42.711 --> 04:52:45.080
THEN WE HAD A SECOND FIRE. IN

04:52:45.147 --> 04:52:47.283
CERTAIN VALLEJO THAT JUMPED TO

04:52:47.349 --> 04:52:48.517
THE DISTRICT IN COULD OF PUT A

04:52:48.584 --> 04:52:50.519
REFINERY IN FIVE TIMES HIGHER

04:52:50.586 --> 04:52:53.122
IN INTERESTINGLY IN BOTH IN ALL

04:52:53.188 --> 04:52:55.391
THE CIRCUMSTANCES BOTH THE

04:52:55.457 --> 04:52:57.493
POWER OUTAGES. THE MORE MORE

04:52:57.559 --> 04:52:59.929
SPECIFIC IN SMALLER FIRES THAT

04:52:59.995 --> 04:53:02.665
HIT JUST MY DISTRICT- I

04:53:02.731 --> 04:53:04.700
EXPERIENCED THIS VERY DIFFERENT

04:53:04.767 --> 04:53:07.636
SO DURING THE PS PS THERE WAS

04:53:07.703 --> 04:53:11.640
MOSTLY. THE COMMUNICATION

04:53:11.707 --> 04:53:15.711
THROUGH P. JEANNIE. BUT THEY

04:53:15.778 --> 04:53:16.478
ALSO ARE DIVISION OF OUR

04:53:16.545 --> 04:53:17.546
GOVERNOR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY

04:53:17.613 --> 04:53:18.547
SERVICES WHERE MY STAFF AND I

04:53:18.614 --> 04:53:23.285
COULD CALL IN. AND BE. THERE

04:53:23.352 --> 04:53:25.287
WERE GOODS AND BADS BUT IF I

04:53:25.354 --> 04:53:28.857
THEN CONTRASTED TO THE- THE

04:53:28.924 --> 04:53:31.060
CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE REFINERY

04:53:31.126 --> 04:53:33.262
FIRES WHERE WE HAVE A CLEARER

04:53:33.329 --> 04:53:35.965
AND I DON'T MEAN THIS JUST FOR

04:53:36.031 --> 04:53:38.200
THE STATE BUT I'M RATHER. I'M

04:53:38.267 --> 04:53:39.468
COMPARING IT TO THE YES PS IN

04:53:39.535 --> 04:53:41.236
THAT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR

04:53:41.303 --> 04:53:42.938
PROTOCOL WHERE IT GOES THROUGH

04:53:43.005 --> 04:53:45.207
THE COUNTY OFFICES AND THERE'S

04:53:45.274 --> 04:53:46.709
A CLEAR HIERARCHY AND MY STAFF

04:53:46.775 --> 04:53:48.477
KNOW IT THEY KNOW WHO AS

04:53:48.544 --> 04:53:49.845
DETERMINATION DETERMINE FOR

04:53:49.912 --> 04:53:51.513
EXAMPLE WHETHER THERE'S

04:53:51.580 --> 04:53:53.682
EVACUATION WHETHER THERE'S ALL

04:53:53.749 --> 04:53:55.384
TERM PLACE WHETHER THERE'S YOU

04:53:55.451 --> 04:53:57.486
KNOW THE QUICK. THE QUICK

04:53:57.553 --> 04:53:59.855
SETTING UP OF CENTERS FOR

04:53:59.922 --> 04:54:01.056
PEOPLE TO BE IN AND ALL THAT

04:54:01.123 --> 04:54:04.760
AND ALL OF THAT WORKED FOR MORE

04:54:04.827 --> 04:54:08.130
SMOOTHLY PS PS THIS IS NOT I'M

04:54:08.197 --> 04:54:11.600
NOT DIRECTING THIS AT THE STATE

04:54:11.667 --> 04:54:14.603
SO MUCH BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE.

04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:15.537
DIFFERENT DIVISIONS I HAD TO

04:54:15.604 --> 04:54:16.305
REACT WITH. THE PS PS ON THE

04:54:16.372 --> 04:54:18.073
STATE SIDE I FOUND I WAS QUITE

04:54:18.140 --> 04:54:19.708
SATISFACTORY BUT WHAT I'M

04:54:19.775 --> 04:54:21.610
REALLY POINTING OUT IS THAT

04:54:21.677 --> 04:54:23.145
THAT KIND OF DIFFERENTIATION

04:54:23.212 --> 04:54:25.047
WHERE THERE WAS A CLEAR.

04:54:25.114 --> 04:54:27.583
PROTOCOL AND CLEAR HIERARCHY.

04:54:27.649 --> 04:54:29.618
IN THE IN THOSE HAZARDS

04:54:29.685 --> 04:54:31.186
CIRCUMSTANCES IT THE

04:54:31.253 --> 04:54:33.288
COMMUNICATION WAS SO MUCH

04:54:33.355 --> 04:54:34.823
BETTER THE RESIDENTS WERE

04:54:34.890 --> 04:54:37.626
BETTER SERVED. AND WHATEVER WE

04:54:37.693 --> 04:54:40.963
CAN DO MAKE THE PS PS

04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.530
EXPERIENCE MORE ANALOGOUS I

04:54:41.597 --> 04:54:44.500
THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND

04:54:44.566 --> 04:54:45.801
THEN FINALLY MY QUESTIONS ARE

04:54:45.868 --> 04:54:48.237
GOING TO BE TO OUR SI PC

04:54:48.303 --> 04:54:50.606
PRESIDENT APPRECIATE VERY MUCH

04:54:50.672 --> 04:54:52.041
THAT YOU'RE HERE. TWO THINGS

04:54:52.107 --> 04:54:55.244
FIRST WHAT DOES SHE HAVE ANY

04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:56.779
KIND OF ESTIMATE OF WHAT IT

04:54:56.845 --> 04:54:59.982
COSTS IN ANY OF OUR I USE TO DO

04:55:00.049 --> 04:55:01.150
THESE POWER OUTAGES NOW

04:55:01.216 --> 04:55:04.686
OBVIOUSLY IT'S A IF IT'S- A

04:55:04.753 --> 04:55:06.121
MORE RESIDENTS YOU KNOW P.

04:55:06.188 --> 04:55:07.723
GENIES WOULD SEEM TO ME.

04:55:07.790 --> 04:55:09.825
OBVIOUSLY MORE COSTLY THAN ESTY

04:55:09.892 --> 04:55:12.094
GENIES OR STDS BUT DO YOU

04:55:12.161 --> 04:55:13.796
REQUEST IN THE TO IN THE REPORT

04:55:13.862 --> 04:55:17.299
TO GET LATER. YOU ASK FOR A

04:55:17.366 --> 04:55:21.403
COST BREAKDOWN. I HAVE NINE IN

04:55:21.470 --> 04:55:23.005
IN THE QUESTION. THEM NOW THAT

04:55:23.072 --> 04:55:23.839
IS NOT TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T IN

04:55:23.906 --> 04:55:25.607
THE FUTURE BUT THE THINGS THAT

04:55:25.674 --> 04:55:28.010
I HAVE DONE SINCE NINETEEN

04:55:28.077 --> 04:55:30.279
SIXTY DAYS OR SO BEING HERE I

04:55:30.345 --> 04:55:32.481
HAVEN'T BUT I THINK THAT IN THE

04:55:32.548 --> 04:55:33.715
PROCEEDINGS WE WILL GET A CALL.

04:55:33.782 --> 04:55:36.185
DOWN SETTING WOULD BE HELPFUL

04:55:36.251 --> 04:55:38.087
FIRST NOTICE HOW COSTLY IT IS

04:55:38.153 --> 04:55:40.155
BECAUSE THAT. HELP US WELL

04:55:40.222 --> 04:55:41.757
ANYWAY WOULD JUST BE USEFUL.

04:55:41.824 --> 04:55:46.161
THE OTHER- IS YOU MENTIONED THE

04:55:46.228 --> 04:55:47.529
DIFFERENT BUDGET FORTIES THAT

04:55:47.596 --> 04:55:48.897
WE GAVE SPACE THERE WITH MY

04:55:48.964 --> 04:55:51.667

THAT WERE GIVEN FOR. THAT

04:55:59.775 --> 04:56:01.710
SPECIFICALLY FOR PS PS

OVERSIGHT- YES ENTER SKINNER I

04:56:05.914 --> 04:56:07.950
LOOKED UP. ON I WAS NOT

04:56:08.016 --> 04:56:10.085
FAMILIAR WITH THAT THAT NUMBER

04:56:10.152 --> 04:56:11.120
EIGHT AHA THAT CAME FROM A

04:56:11.186 --> 04:56:13.889
SPRING LETTER. THAT WAS

04:56:13.956 --> 04:56:16.825
SUBMITTED AND ACTUALLY SEVERAL

04:56:16.892 --> 04:56:18.160
SEVERAL THINGS THAT WERE

04:56:18.227 --> 04:56:19.795
REQUEST THAT THE I'M MORE

04:56:19.862 --> 04:56:22.631
COMBINED. TO AS I SAID EIGHT

04:56:22.698 --> 04:56:23.565
EIGHT AND A DIRECT

04:56:23.632 --> 04:56:26.001
APPROPRIATION OF FORTY SEVEN

04:56:26.068 --> 04:56:28.337
MILLION DOLLARS TOOK CARE. IN

04:56:28.403 --> 04:56:30.105
SEPARATION. MISSIONS AND SOME

04:56:30.172 --> 04:56:32.241
OTHER POSITION. ALSO THERE IS

04:56:32.307 --> 04:56:38.280
THAT WERE COMBINED FROM- TEN

04:56:38.347 --> 04:56:44.386
FIFTY FOUR. IT. MASON WAS IN I

04:56:44.453 --> 04:56:46.822

MAKING PRO ASSIGNED WE ARE

04:56:48.624 --> 04:56:49.291
INDEED AND WE WILL MAKE MORE IN

04:56:49.358 --> 04:56:50.692
THE UPCOMING BUDGET. EXCELLENT

04:56:50.759 --> 04:56:53.162
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION AND-

04:56:53.228 --> 04:56:54.463
I DON'T. I DON'T LIKE TO

04:56:54.530 --> 04:56:55.831
MICROMANAGE OUR ROOM THREE

04:56:55.898 --> 04:56:56.865
AGENCIES YOU ALL NEED TO BUT I

04:56:56.932 --> 04:56:58.667
JUST WONDERED. BECAUSE IN

04:56:58.734 --> 04:57:01.103
ASKING THE DIFFERENT FIRE USE

04:57:01.170 --> 04:57:03.472
ABOUT WHETHER THEY HAD EITHER

04:57:03.539 --> 04:57:07.476
MANDATED TO IMPLEMENT BEST

04:57:07.543 --> 04:57:08.110
AVAILABLE CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES

04:57:08.177 --> 04:57:09.778
OR WHETHER THEY ENTER TO

04:57:09.845 --> 04:57:12.681
INCLUDE SUCH AN EVALUATION AND

04:57:12.748 --> 04:57:15.851
ANY OF THEIR PLANS- THE ANSWERS

04:57:15.918 --> 04:57:17.853
THAT. I GOT FROM WHICH WOULD

04:57:17.920 --> 04:57:21.557
STAY HADN'T BUT ES DE GENIE FOR

04:57:21.623 --> 04:57:22.824
EXAMPLE DID IT ON THEIR OWN.

04:57:22.891 --> 04:57:25.928
AND IN PGP INDICATED THAT

04:57:25.994 --> 04:57:30.065
THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW BUT I

04:57:30.132 --> 04:57:33.569
WONDERED SINCE IT'S. TIVOLI

04:57:33.635 --> 04:57:34.736
COMMON FOR OUR AND REGULATORY

04:57:34.803 --> 04:57:36.872
AGENCIES TO DIRECT THAT FROM

04:57:36.939 --> 04:57:39.007
THE ENTITIES THAT THEY REGULATE

04:57:39.074 --> 04:57:40.709
IS THAT SOMETHING THE P.

04:57:40.776 --> 04:57:42.010
HOUSTON MIGHT CONSIDER LOOKING

04:57:42.077 --> 04:57:46.715
OUT. THE DOOR DIRECTED- TWO HI

04:57:46.782 --> 04:57:48.784
SAFE AND RELIABLE ENERGY THEY

04:57:48.850 --> 04:57:50.219
ARE DIRECTED TO DO THAT THEY

04:57:50.285 --> 04:57:52.921
HAVE BEEN GIVEN IN IN RECENT

04:57:52.988 --> 04:57:54.590
LEGISLATION DIRECT FURTHER

04:57:54.656 --> 04:57:58.427
DIRECTION SUCH AS IN. AB TEN

04:57:58.493 --> 04:57:59.361
FIFTY FOUR SO THERE IS

04:57:59.428 --> 04:58:00.896
DIRECTION THAT IS GIVEN TO THEM

04:58:00.963 --> 04:58:02.598
IN DIFFERENT PROCEEDINGS AND

04:58:02.664 --> 04:58:04.233
YOU THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ALSO

04:58:04.299 --> 04:58:05.934
DIRECTED US TO DIRECT THEM SO

04:58:06.001 --> 04:58:06.935
THERE ARE DIFFERENT

04:58:07.002 --> 04:58:09.538
APPLICATIONS OF ACTIONS YES SO

04:58:09.605 --> 04:58:11.506
I WOULD SAY I THINK THAT WAS IN

04:58:11.573 --> 04:58:13.475
RESPONSE TO A VERY SPECIFIC

04:58:13.542 --> 04:58:15.143
CHEF I CAN RECALL THE TESTIMONY

04:58:15.210 --> 04:58:20.148
BUT WILL DEFINITELY. TEN FIFTY

04:58:20.215 --> 04:58:25.621
FOUR AS AND I AM ONLY I'M ONLY.

04:58:25.687 --> 04:58:27.522
I SUPPOSE SEATED ON IT A BIT AS-

04:58:27.589 --> 04:58:28.957
WHEN I HEAR FROM OR ARE YOU U.

04:58:29.024 --> 04:58:30.926
pP. JEANNIE THAT THEY FEEL THEY

04:58:30.993 --> 04:58:32.294
MAY NEED TEN YEARS I GUESS THAT

04:58:32.361 --> 04:58:34.096
FOR THOSE OF US WHO REPRESENT

04:58:34.162 --> 04:58:35.631
THAT SURGERY IT'S VERY SCARY TO

04:58:35.697 --> 04:58:37.599
CONSIDER THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

04:58:37.666 --> 04:58:39.167
NEED THAT TEN YEARS AND CLEARLY

04:58:39.234 --> 04:58:42.704
WE KNOW THAT. CERTAIN CERTAIN

04:58:42.771 --> 04:58:45.974
TECHNOLOGIES OR HARDENING AND

04:58:46.041 --> 04:58:48.977
RESILIENCY TYPE OF- APPROACHES

04:58:49.044 --> 04:58:51.813
ARE BOTH FASTER TO IMPLEMENT

04:58:51.880 --> 04:58:53.849
AND LESS EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT

04:58:53.915 --> 04:58:55.951
AND SO I'M I'M I'M THINKING

04:58:56.018 --> 04:58:58.920
AND- I WOULD NOT MANDATE IT TO

04:58:58.987 --> 04:59:00.989
YOU ALL BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DO

04:59:01.056 --> 04:59:03.325
AND WHETHER IN FACT THE BEST

04:59:03.392 --> 04:59:04.960
APPROACH. BUT IF THERE ARE ONES

04:59:05.027 --> 04:59:07.663
THAT ARE AFFECTED AND FAST NOT

04:59:07.729 --> 04:59:09.931
AS EXPENSIVE THEN THE SOONER WE

04:59:09.998 --> 04:59:13.802
CAN MOVE ON AND IT LEAST IT

04:59:13.869 --> 04:59:18.573
TEAMS WOULD BE VERY LARGE CALL.

04:59:18.640 --> 04:59:19.207
GREAT AND I THINK THAT- SOME OF

04:59:19.274 --> 04:59:20.275
THE TESTIMONY. TODAY ABOUT THE

04:59:20.342 --> 04:59:20.809
IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION

04:59:20.876 --> 04:59:22.177
SHARING- I THINK SAN DIEGO GAS

04:59:22.244 --> 04:59:24.780
ELECTRIC HAD SAID THAT THEY NOT

04:59:24.846 --> 04:59:26.648
ONLY DO THEY SHARE INFORMATION

04:59:26.715 --> 04:59:27.983
WITH P. GENE IN PARTICULAR BUT

04:59:28.050 --> 04:59:30.285
THEY LOOK TOWARD. BOTH P.

04:59:30.352 --> 04:59:32.454
JEANNIE IN SOCAL EDISON TO

04:59:32.521 --> 04:59:32.988
LEARN THINGS AS WELL AND I

04:59:33.055 --> 04:59:35.590
WOULD URGE MORE OF THAT. GREAT

04:59:35.657 --> 04:59:37.092
CAN THERE'S MANY MORE THINGS

04:59:37.159 --> 04:59:38.060
I'D LOVE TO ASK BUT MY

04:59:38.126 --> 04:59:40.329
COLLEAGUES BEACON I DO HAVE TO

04:59:40.395 --> 04:59:41.463
LEAVE SO MY LAST QUESTION WOULD

04:59:41.530 --> 04:59:44.866
BE TO. TO MISTER TAYLOR DUTY.

04:59:44.933 --> 04:59:46.868
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE

04:59:46.935 --> 04:59:48.770
SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT- YES

04:59:48.837 --> 04:59:51.973
WAS GIVEN TO HELP COMMUNITIES

04:59:52.040 --> 04:59:52.541
AND OTHERS PREPARE FOR THESE

04:59:52.607 --> 04:59:55.844
POWER OUTAGES HAS SPENT. THERE

04:59:55.911 --> 04:59:56.478
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HAS BEEN

04:59:56.545 --> 04:59:58.213
SPENT BUT I COULD TELL YOU HOW

04:59:58.280 --> 04:59:59.448
MUCH HAS BEEN ALLOCATED- SO.

04:59:59.514 --> 05:00:03.885
THE. IT WAS THIRTY SEVEN POINT

05:00:03.952 --> 05:00:05.087
FIVE MILLION THAT WAS SHARED

05:00:05.153 --> 05:00:07.322
AMONGST. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

05:00:07.389 --> 05:00:09.925
WE'VE ALLOCATED- TWENTY SIX

05:00:09.991 --> 05:00:14.329
MILLION OF THAT TOO- COUNTIES-

05:00:14.396 --> 05:00:15.997
BUT THE FOLLOWING BREAKDOWN-

05:00:16.064 --> 05:00:18.533
WAS A- BASE WAS POPULATION.

FOUR AND IT'S NEW AND IT ISN'T

05:04:54.776 --> 05:04:56.144
REALLY FULLY FUNDED SO THEY

05:04:56.211 --> 05:04:58.580
DON'T HAVE THAT AS A BACKSTOP.

05:04:58.647 --> 05:04:59.114

DO THEY HAVE BESIDES A P. S. P.

05:05:11.059 --> 05:05:16.264
S. IF I MAY CENTER I THINK WE

05:05:16.331 --> 05:05:19.401
HAVE THREE DIFFERENT I- USE-

05:05:19.467 --> 05:05:20.301
WITH THE SAME REGULATORY SCHEME

05:05:20.368 --> 05:05:22.237
YOU SEE REALLY DIFFERENT. BY

ALL THREE I USE BOTH IN TERMS

05:05:24.372 --> 05:05:26.274
OF THE STATIONS UP UNTIL THIS

05:05:26.341 --> 05:05:28.209
POINT AND RELATIVE INVESTMENTS

05:05:28.276 --> 05:05:29.911
IN. IN HARDENING THEIR

THROUGH THESE EVENTS AND YOU

05:05:35.517 --> 05:05:37.152
SAW CHANGES IN THE USE OF THESE

05:05:37.218 --> 05:05:39.020
EVENTS OVER TIME SO IF YOU LOOK

05:05:39.087 --> 05:05:41.089
AT SANDY- GAS AND ELECTRIC.

05:05:41.156 --> 05:05:42.223
THEY HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL

05:05:42.290 --> 05:05:45.126
INCREASES IN- IN WEATHER DATA

05:05:45.193 --> 05:05:47.128
AND WEATHER INFORMATION TO HAVE

05:05:47.195 --> 05:05:48.797
A BETTER SENSE OF- OF WHAT YOU

05:05:48.863 --> 05:05:50.832
KNOW WHAT SANTA WINDS ARE GOING

05:05:50.899 --> 05:05:52.267
TO BE DOING. THAT ARE USING

05:05:52.333 --> 05:05:53.334
THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR

05:05:53.401 --> 05:05:55.170
DECISION MAKING THEY HAVE A

05:05:55.236 --> 05:05:56.438
STATE OF THE ART YOU'LL SEE

05:05:56.504 --> 05:05:58.506
THAT THEY ARE ALL THAT THEY ARE

05:05:58.573 --> 05:06:00.508
OPERATING TO MAKE REAL TIME

05:06:00.575 --> 05:06:03.278
DECISIONS. THEY ALSO HAVE HARD

05:06:03.344 --> 05:06:04.279
THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKED AT

05:06:04.345 --> 05:06:06.181
AREAS IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

05:06:06.247 --> 05:06:08.049
GOING TO BE A HIGHER LEVEL OF

05:06:08.116 --> 05:06:10.719
RISK AND- AND THE LOOK AT SOME

05:06:10.785 --> 05:06:13.521
SOLUTIONS. FOR HOW TO DO BE A

05:06:13.588 --> 05:06:15.123
BIKE RATES ARE MANY GROUPS OR

05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:16.424
OTHER APPROACHES FOR HOW THEY

05:06:16.491 --> 05:06:17.792
DEAL WITH THOSE BUT WHEN WE BUT

05:06:17.859 --> 05:06:19.160
THEY STILL TURNED OFF THEIR

05:06:19.227 --> 05:06:21.262
POWERS ALL THREE OF THEM USE PS

05:06:21.329 --> 05:06:24.265
PS IN A MUCH. BROADER WAY FOR

05:06:24.332 --> 05:06:25.767
SHORTER PERIODS OF TIME

05:06:25.834 --> 05:06:27.268
AFFECTING MUCH SMALLER

05:06:27.335 --> 05:06:30.972
ENTITIES- SO LOOK FOR EXAMPLE

05:06:31.039 --> 05:06:32.607
AT THE EDISON EXPERIENCE THIS

05:06:32.674 --> 05:06:37.645
YEAR. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF

05:06:37.712 --> 05:06:42.050
PEOPLE THE EDISON. THE

05:06:42.117 --> 05:06:43.485
POTENTIAL OF PSP S. AND THE

05:06:43.551 --> 05:06:45.186
RELATIVE AMOUNT OF- CUSTOMERS

05:06:45.253 --> 05:06:45.787
WHO WERE TURNED WHERE ARE WAS

05:06:45.854 --> 05:06:47.288
TURNED OFF- AS WELL AS YOU LOOK

05:06:47.355 --> 05:06:47.822
AT THE DURATION OF THOSE

05:06:47.889 --> 05:06:48.423
OUTAGES IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

05:06:48.490 --> 05:06:50.692
WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE PGA ANY

05:06:50.759 --> 05:06:52.761
SERVICE TOWARD TERRITORY WE

05:06:52.827 --> 05:06:54.329
LOOK AT ALL THREE UTILITIES.

05:06:54.395 --> 05:06:57.065
THE USE OF PSP A TERMS OF THE

05:06:57.132 --> 05:06:58.800
SIZE OF THE EVENT THE DURATION

05:06:58.867 --> 05:07:00.769
OF THE OUTAGES THE BACK TO

05:07:00.835 --> 05:07:02.337
COLLEGES IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY

05:07:02.403 --> 05:07:04.139
FOR THE OTHER TWO UTILITIES AND

05:07:04.205 --> 05:07:05.440
THEY'RE ALL OPERATING ON THE

05:07:05.507 --> 05:07:08.343
SAME REGULATORY REGIME. SO WE

05:07:08.409 --> 05:07:08.977
WOULD AGREE WITH MISS BACK SURE

05:07:09.043 --> 05:07:12.280
THAT. BECAUSE NO ONE IS SAID

05:07:12.347 --> 05:07:13.848
DON'T USE PSP AS I HAVEN'T

05:07:13.915 --> 05:07:15.950
HEARD THAT TODAY BUT- WHEN YOU

05:07:16.017 --> 05:07:19.721
DO IT- WE SAW- MAYBE TO

05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:22.690
PARAPHRASE MS BOETTCHER-

05:07:22.757 --> 05:07:24.826
IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION.

05:07:24.893 --> 05:07:26.995
LACK OF PREPAREDNESS RESOLVE WE

05:07:27.061 --> 05:07:30.365
SAW. A VERY DISAPPOINTING.

05:07:30.431 --> 05:07:32.767
EXECUTION AND SO THAT'S WHAT

05:07:32.834 --> 05:07:37.238
WE'RE TRYING TO ROOM SO. WHEN

05:07:37.305 --> 05:07:38.473
THAT THE NOW YOUR NEW PAIR IF I

05:07:38.540 --> 05:07:42.243
CAN ASK YOU A QUESTION- DID THE

05:07:42.310 --> 05:07:44.712
CPUC GIVE ALL THREE UTILITIES.

05:07:44.779 --> 05:07:50.652
A NERVE. RATE INCREASES THE PAY

05:07:50.718 --> 05:07:51.219
FOR NOT ONLY THE HARPING OF

05:07:51.286 --> 05:07:55.723
ASSETS. ALSO FOR THE ABILITY TO

05:07:55.790 --> 05:07:58.793
PURSUE RENEWABLE ENERGY

05:07:58.860 --> 05:07:59.961
ALTERNATIVES THAT THEY WERE

05:08:00.028 --> 05:08:02.096
ASKED TO BUILD THE DO WE GIVE

05:08:02.163 --> 05:08:06.668
THEM ENOUGH ROOM. WELL I AS I

05:08:06.734 --> 05:08:07.702
SAID I'VE BEEN THERE SINCE

05:08:07.769 --> 05:08:09.370
AUGUST SIXTEENTH SO I HAVEN'T

05:08:09.437 --> 05:08:11.372
BEEN AWARE OF ALL PROCEEDINGS

05:08:11.439 --> 05:08:13.641
BEFORE US BUT I WOULD GENERALLY

05:08:13.708 --> 05:08:16.044
SAY YES WE THEY COME BEFORE US.

05:08:16.110 --> 05:08:20.014
AT WITH RATE CASES AND- THERE'S

05:08:20.081 --> 05:08:22.483
A THEY PROCESS THAT WE USE. IN

05:08:22.550 --> 05:08:24.953
THE PROCEEDINGS WITH. A LOT OF

05:08:25.019 --> 05:08:26.321

ORGANIZATIONS AND SO FORTH THAT

05:08:31.759 --> 05:08:35.063
COME THEIR CUSTOMERS- AND COME

05:08:35.129 --> 05:08:36.130
THROUGH THAT PROCEEDINGS WITH

05:08:36.197 --> 05:08:39.400
SOMETHING THAT IS THAT ALLOWS

05:08:39.467 --> 05:08:39.968
THEM TO BE SAFE RELIABLE AND

05:08:40.034 --> 05:08:42.437
AFFORDABLE. I DON'T KNOW IF MY

05:08:42.503 --> 05:08:44.172
COLLEAGUES LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING

05:08:44.239 --> 05:08:48.076
LESE A TO THE- ORGAN. SO THEN

05:08:48.142 --> 05:08:48.676
LAST QUESTION OF MISTER GELLER

05:08:48.743 --> 05:08:53.248
DO G. WE JUST APPROVED THE

05:08:53.314 --> 05:08:54.716
LEGISLATURE APPROVED. A NEW

05:08:54.782 --> 05:08:57.452
FEET PER CELL PHONES TO MAKE

05:08:57.518 --> 05:09:01.723
SURE THAT NINE ONE ONE WOULD BE.

05:09:01.789 --> 05:09:04.959
THERE AND IT NEXT GEN IS IT IS

05:09:05.026 --> 05:09:06.628
IT NEXT GEN NINE ONE ONE IT'S

05:09:06.694 --> 05:09:09.831
THAT INTERNET BASED. YES IT IS

05:09:09.898 --> 05:09:10.465
SO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO RELY

05:09:10.531 --> 05:09:13.501
ON. ITS MESSAGE WE VISIT MISS

05:09:13.568 --> 05:09:15.770
BECHER'S RECOMMENDATION HAVE

05:09:15.837 --> 05:09:19.674
BACKUP GENERATORS IN. OTHERWISE

05:09:19.741 --> 05:09:20.875
HOW DOES YOUR SYSTEM THREE OUT

05:09:20.942 --> 05:09:22.877
OF IT IT IS IT'S A IT'S A

05:09:22.944 --> 05:09:25.446
REDUNDANCY IN THE SYSTEM- THAT

05:09:25.513 --> 05:09:28.483
IS B. AS MICROWAVE AND INTERNET

05:09:28.549 --> 05:09:30.685
BASED STATE BECAUSE THIS DATA

05:09:30.752 --> 05:09:32.720
AND VOICE AND LOOK AT WORK

05:09:32.787 --> 05:09:35.523
THESE THESE THESE DEVICES ARE

05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:37.926
CURRENTLY VOICE AND- SLOWLY

05:09:37.992 --> 05:09:38.693
MOVING OFF OF VOICE AND

05:09:38.760 --> 05:09:40.561
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO DATA.

05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:41.763
THAT'S THE VOICE OVER IP

05:09:41.829 --> 05:09:44.999
PROTOCOL TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE

05:09:45.066 --> 05:09:46.334
THE SYSTEM THAT BAD AS A

05:09:46.401 --> 05:09:48.169
TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BE AS A

05:09:48.236 --> 05:09:50.805
SOCIETY ARE BEING PUSHED INTO

05:09:50.872 --> 05:09:53.007
WE HAVE NO DIRECT CONTROL OVER

05:09:53.074 --> 05:09:54.742
THAT TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE IT IS

05:09:54.809 --> 05:09:56.411
PRIVATELY OWNED AND PRIVATELY

05:09:56.477 --> 05:09:59.113
MANAGED WHAT WE HAVE IS WE'VE

05:09:59.180 --> 05:10:01.716
GOT THE WORKING END OF IT RIGHT

05:10:01.783 --> 05:10:03.151
TOWARD THE POINTY END OF THE

05:10:03.217 --> 05:10:04.485
SPEAR I UTILIZE IT. BUT WILL

05:10:04.552 --> 05:10:06.821
HAVE A SH PRINCES BUT WHEN WE

05:10:06.888 --> 05:10:08.990
UTILIZE THIS DEVICE THIS

05:10:09.057 --> 05:10:09.724
LIFESAVING CRITICAL

05:10:09.791 --> 05:10:12.627
COMMUNICATIONSDEVICE IT HAS

05:10:12.694 --> 05:10:16.898
RESILIENCY. BUILT INTO THE

05:10:16.965 --> 05:10:20.168
SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. WHICH I

05:10:20.234 --> 05:10:21.869
WOULD ALSO ARGUE EXIST IN

05:10:21.936 --> 05:10:22.403
HURRICANE PRONE STATE IN

05:10:22.470 --> 05:10:23.071
FLOODING PRONE STATE WARREN

05:10:23.137 --> 05:10:24.639
CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA WE

05:10:24.706 --> 05:10:25.373
HAVE. ALL SORTS OF KIND OF

05:10:25.440 --> 05:10:28.076
DISASTERS DIGEST THIS IS THE

05:10:28.142 --> 05:10:29.377
WAY IT IS BEEN THAT WAY SINCE

05:10:29.444 --> 05:10:31.346
THE LESSONS WE- WE MADE EIGHT.

05:10:31.412 --> 05:10:33.948
AND THE FACT IS THAT BECAUSE WE

05:10:34.015 --> 05:10:35.249
HAVE THIS WE NEED TO HAVE

05:10:35.316 --> 05:10:36.884
ASSURANCE THAT THE SYSTEM IS

05:10:36.951 --> 05:10:39.654
RESILIENT THAT MEANS THAT THE

05:10:39.721 --> 05:10:43.524
CELL SITES. ARE HEARTENED THAT

05:10:43.591 --> 05:10:45.693
THEY HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

05:10:45.760 --> 05:10:46.728
AROUND WHILE FIRE THEY'VE GOT

05:10:46.794 --> 05:10:50.398
BATTERY OR FOR. BACK UP BEYOND

05:10:50.465 --> 05:10:52.100
A FOUR HOUR TIME FRAME THAT WE

05:10:52.166 --> 05:10:52.667
KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA WE

05:10:52.734 --> 05:10:54.402
STAND PARTICULARLY NOW IT

05:10:54.469 --> 05:10:55.436
APPEARS. THAT THE COULD GO FOR

05:10:55.503 --> 05:10:57.972
MULTIPLE EIGHTIES WE HAVE TO

05:10:58.039 --> 05:10:59.474
KNOW THAT THAT SYSTEM IS STATE

05:10:59.540 --> 05:11:02.377
RESILIENT. IN THE BACK CALL THE

05:11:02.443 --> 05:11:04.078
FOR THE LINES THERE ARE THE

05:11:04.145 --> 05:11:05.313
WIRELINE THAT ARE MOVING THE

05:11:05.380 --> 05:11:08.316
DATA. ARE PROTECTED SO THAT

05:11:08.383 --> 05:11:10.018
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT OF FIRE OR

05:11:10.084 --> 05:11:11.552
BREAK IT EARTHQUAKE THAT THE

05:11:11.619 --> 05:11:13.821
WRAPPED IN AND MADE HARDEN.

05:11:13.888 --> 05:11:16.424
IT'S A SIMPLE REQUESTWE'RE

05:11:16.491 --> 05:11:17.892
ASKING TO BE ABLE TO HARDEN UP

05:11:17.959 --> 05:11:20.728
THAT SYSTEM. AND IT'S A

05:11:20.795 --> 05:11:22.530
PRIORITY ON THE PART OF THE

05:11:22.597 --> 05:11:28.703
PEACE TO DO THAT AND- BECAUSE

05:11:28.770 --> 05:11:29.237
THE ALTERNATIVE HAS AND AS

05:11:29.303 --> 05:11:33.041
DURING THE PSP. THAT AT THE

05:11:33.107 --> 05:11:33.841
HEAT OF THE MOMENT WHILE WE

05:11:33.908 --> 05:11:34.742
WERE TRYING TO KEEP THE SYSTEM

05:11:34.809 --> 05:11:36.244
OPERATIONAL. THE TELECOMS

05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:37.945
WE'RE- GOING ALL OVER THE

05:11:38.012 --> 05:11:41.682
WESTERN U. S. FIND A FIND

05:11:41.749 --> 05:11:43.684
GENERATORS BY THE HOT. AND DRY

05:11:43.751 --> 05:11:46.754
IN THE CALIFORNIA. REALIZING

05:11:46.821 --> 05:11:48.756
WHEN THEY GOT CALIFORNIA BORDER

05:11:48.823 --> 05:11:50.158
THAT THOSE GENERAL DID MEET AIR

05:11:50.224 --> 05:11:53.227
QUALITY REQUIREMENTS AND IN

05:11:53.294 --> 05:11:54.796
REQUIRED THE STATE BACK TO MY

05:11:54.862 --> 05:11:56.931
OFFICE TO STREAMLINE THAT

05:11:56.998 --> 05:11:59.300
PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM

05:11:59.367 --> 05:12:00.268
INTO THE STATE WHICH TOOK

05:12:00.334 --> 05:12:02.670
ACTION ON OUR PART AND THEN

05:12:02.737 --> 05:12:03.638
THERE FIND THE PLACE WHERE THEY

05:12:03.704 --> 05:12:04.138
WERE GONNA GO PUT THOSE

05:12:04.205 --> 05:12:06.374
GENERATORS. THAT'S NOT THE WAY

05:12:06.441 --> 05:12:08.843
TO THAT'S REACTIVE AND NOT

05:12:08.910 --> 05:12:10.211
PROACTIVE AND WHAT WE WANT TO

05:12:10.278 --> 05:12:12.046
DO IS WE TO OUR PARTY WITH

05:12:12.113 --> 05:12:14.649
THEM. I IDENTIFY IN A PROACTIVE

05:12:14.715 --> 05:12:16.117
WAY HOW DO WE MAKE THE SYSTEM

05:12:16.184 --> 05:12:19.220
BETTER BECAUSE THE ENHANCED BY

05:12:19.287 --> 05:12:19.854
ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT YOU TALKED

05:12:19.921 --> 05:12:21.389
ABOUT THAT DID YOU HELPING TO

05:12:21.456 --> 05:12:23.124
FIND IS GOT NOW ALL THE

05:12:23.191 --> 05:12:24.892
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE THAT

05:12:24.959 --> 05:12:26.661
THE MS RESILIENT IN A IN A BAD

05:12:26.727 --> 05:12:28.429
PART OF THE SYSTEMS GET RESERVE

05:12:28.496 --> 05:12:29.864
INTO BIG DISASTER. THANK YOU

05:12:29.931 --> 05:12:35.136
YOU MISTER. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS

05:12:35.203 --> 05:12:39.006
THAT A COMMON THEMES. TODAY AND

05:12:39.073 --> 05:12:39.974
WE I DON'T THINK WE REALLY

05:12:40.041 --> 05:12:40.842
TOUCHED ON IN DEPTH BUT WE'VE-

05:12:40.908 --> 05:12:42.310
TALKED ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES

05:12:42.376 --> 05:12:44.112
HELPING TO CREATE THE CIRCUITS

05:12:44.178 --> 05:12:46.080
THAT CUT OFF A WIRE. A COUPLE

05:12:46.147 --> 05:12:48.583
CA KIND OF FOUR'S

05:12:48.649 --> 05:12:49.150
ELECTRICITY ONCE THAT WIRES

05:12:49.217 --> 05:12:52.220
SNAPPED IN AN EVENT. TALKED

05:12:52.286 --> 05:12:52.854
ABOUT OF THOSE PROVIDING PEOPLE

05:12:52.920 --> 05:12:56.324
WITH THE GENERATOR'S AT A TIME

05:12:56.390 --> 05:12:59.093
WHEN WE CAN ALL AGREE CHEN USE

05:12:59.160 --> 05:13:01.762
GENERATORS ARE VERY HARD TO

05:13:01.829 --> 05:13:02.363
COME BY AT SUCH AN ASSET THAT

05:13:02.430 --> 05:13:04.565
IT'S VERY HARD TO ME YOU HAVE

05:13:04.632 --> 05:13:06.200
TO FEEL THAT YOU HAVE TO

05:13:06.267 --> 05:13:06.801
DELIVER IT YOU HAVE TO. GET IT

05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:09.871
OPERATIONAL. MAN AS WE TALK

05:13:09.937 --> 05:13:12.106
ABOUT A TECHNOLOGY I RECENTLY

05:13:12.173 --> 05:13:13.641
ATTENDED A NEST TEACHING THE

05:13:13.708 --> 05:13:16.244
SUPPLIER- A CONFERENCE WHERE

05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:19.213
THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLICIT. THE

05:13:19.280 --> 05:13:20.114
PRIVATE SECTOR TO COME UP WITH

05:13:20.181 --> 05:13:22.650
SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THESE YOU

05:13:22.717 --> 05:13:27.054
KNOW ENERGY TO DELIVERY- GOALS

05:13:27.121 --> 05:13:27.655
THAN THE THEIR FUTURE BECOMING

05:13:27.722 --> 05:13:29.557
MORE COMPLEX THAN WE WANT. OF

05:13:29.624 --> 05:13:31.025
NEW TECHNOLOGY TO SOLVE THE

05:13:31.092 --> 05:13:32.860
PROBLEMS OF TODAY IN THE FUTURE

05:13:32.927 --> 05:13:34.729
AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME ONE WE

05:13:34.795 --> 05:13:38.866
HAVE. BATTERY. OF PLANTS NOW

05:13:38.933 --> 05:13:40.635
THAT EXIST IN OUR STATE THAT

05:13:40.701 --> 05:13:43.838
ARE OF USED TO STORE POWER.

05:13:43.905 --> 05:13:44.805
HAVE WE ALREADY HAVE A

05:13:44.872 --> 05:13:46.707
TECHNOLOGY WERE WE HAVE BATTERY

05:13:46.774 --> 05:13:49.610
POWERS OR POWER A POWER IN OUR

05:13:49.677 --> 05:13:51.112
STATE JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO

05:13:51.179 --> 05:13:53.080
ME IF WE COULD. LOCATE ONE OF

05:13:53.147 --> 05:13:57.518
THOSE BATTERIES. AND EITHER A

05:13:57.585 --> 05:14:00.721
HOSPITAL OR IN THE HOME OF

05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:02.857
SOMEBODY WHO. WHO CAN'T BE SHUT

05:14:02.924 --> 05:14:06.227
OFF FROM POWER BECAUSE OF THEIR

05:14:06.294 --> 05:14:06.861
URGENT NEEDS HEALTH OR WHATEVER

05:14:06.928 --> 05:14:09.597
OTHER REASON. AND IF SOMEHOW WE

05:14:09.664 --> 05:14:10.965
COULD LOOK THOSE IN THOSE HOUSE

05:14:11.032 --> 05:14:13.968
IN THE NEXT YEAR IF THERE IS A

05:14:14.035 --> 05:14:14.569
WILL PAY TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND

05:14:14.635 --> 05:14:17.138
INCLUDE IT IN TWO. THE GOALS

05:14:17.205 --> 05:14:20.341
THAT WE'VE OUTLINED TODAY. IT

05:14:20.408 --> 05:14:20.908
JUST SEEMS MORE SENSE TO ME

05:14:20.975 --> 05:14:23.144
THAT HAVING. PUTTING THEM IN A

05:14:23.211 --> 05:14:25.079
PERMANENT LOCATION IN

05:14:25.146 --> 05:14:26.547
ANTICIPATION OF THESE EVENTS

05:14:26.614 --> 05:14:28.583
BUT HELP SOLVE A LOT OF THESE

05:14:28.649 --> 05:14:30.818
LOGISTICAL POWERS THAT WE COULD

05:14:30.885 --> 05:14:32.820
CUT OFF POWER BUT THE UTILITIES

05:14:32.887 --> 05:14:33.387
COULD STILL CHARGING THEIR

05:14:33.454 --> 05:14:34.989
CUSTOMERS POWERS AS A DROP

05:14:35.056 --> 05:14:36.924
DOWN. THAT ENERGY THAT'S BEEN

05:14:36.991 --> 05:14:38.259
STORED IN THEIR POWER IT JUST

05:14:38.326 --> 05:14:41.596
SEEMS LIKE THEY'LL CONTINUE TO

05:14:41.662 --> 05:14:42.196
MAKE MONEY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO

05:14:42.263 --> 05:14:44.865
HAVE POWER. WHEN WE COULD SOLVE

05:14:44.932 --> 05:14:46.167
THOSE THOSE GOALS WITH THE

05:14:46.234 --> 05:14:46.767
TECHNOLOGY THAT ALREADY EXISTS

05:14:46.834 --> 05:14:50.838
OR. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. YOU

05:14:50.905 --> 05:14:53.307
THINK IS PRACTICABLE IT IS A

05:14:53.374 --> 05:14:53.975
FEASIBLE SOMETHING THAT WE

05:14:54.041 --> 05:14:55.943
COULD WORK ON THE SITE HERE TO

05:14:56.010 --> 05:14:56.644
MAYBE HAVE IN PLACE BY THE

05:14:56.711 --> 05:14:59.413
TIME. THIS AND YOU KNOW THE

05:14:59.480 --> 05:15:02.383
NEXT SEASON COMES ALONG I THINK

05:15:02.450 --> 05:15:03.884
AND JUSTIN IN TERMS OF A PART

05:15:03.951 --> 05:15:06.454
OF WHAT I HEAR AND PART OF WHAT

05:15:06.520 --> 05:15:08.022
YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT. IT'S

05:15:08.089 --> 05:15:09.490
IMPORTANT TO SOLVE FOR SAFE

05:15:09.557 --> 05:15:11.525
AFFORDABLE RELIABLE AND CLEAN

05:15:11.592 --> 05:15:13.394
AND NOT TO CREATE FALSE

05:15:13.461 --> 05:15:14.762
DICHOTOMY ABOUT THE EXTENT TO

05:15:14.829 --> 05:15:16.364
WHICH SOLVING FOR ONE OF THESE.

05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:17.965
RUNS COUNTER TO SOLVING FOR THE

05:15:18.032 --> 05:15:19.600
OTHER ONE IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT

05:15:19.667 --> 05:15:21.168
OPTIONS IN AND THINGS UNDER

05:15:21.235 --> 05:15:22.270
CONSIDERATION THERE SOME REALLY

05:15:22.336 --> 05:15:23.838
IMPORTANT WORK THAT IF YOU SEE

05:15:23.904 --> 05:15:25.740
HAS LAUNCHED. THAT I THINK WILL

05:15:25.806 --> 05:15:28.209
INFORM UP SOME OF THIS PART OF

05:15:28.276 --> 05:15:30.478
IT IS AN ANALYSIS OF LOOKING

05:15:30.544 --> 05:15:31.379
AT. YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY

05:15:31.445 --> 05:15:33.314
WOULD HAVE HOW- HAD POWER BEEN

05:15:33.381 --> 05:15:35.383
ON BASE WITH MODELING FOR BASED

05:15:35.449 --> 05:15:37.818
ON LINES AT THE GROUND WHAT WE

05:15:37.885 --> 05:15:38.753
THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO

05:15:38.819 --> 05:15:43.157
THOSE FIRES TO UNDERSTAND. AS

05:15:43.224 --> 05:15:43.691
WE STEP BACK AND WE THINK

05:15:43.758 --> 05:15:46.661
AROUND THE USE OF. IT'S REALLY

05:15:46.727 --> 05:15:47.261
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO PREVENT

05:15:47.328 --> 05:15:50.331
CATASTROPHIC FIRES NOT ANY AND

05:15:50.398 --> 05:15:53.200
ALL FIVE SO THE PLACE THAT IT

05:15:53.267 --> 05:15:55.036
YOU KNOW LOOKING SO TOOK TRYING

05:15:55.102 --> 05:15:55.936
TO UNDERSTAND KIND OF WHAT WE

05:15:56.003 --> 05:15:57.038
THINK WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

05:15:57.104 --> 05:15:58.806
MODELING IS IMPORTANT SOME RISK

05:15:58.873 --> 05:16:00.408
ASSESSMENT THAT IS ALSO BEING

05:16:00.474 --> 05:16:03.110
DONE- LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHEN

05:16:03.177 --> 05:16:05.379
WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS

05:16:05.446 --> 05:16:06.380
WELL- AND WE LOOK AT THIS

05:16:06.447 --> 05:16:07.782
MODELING OR THEIR COMMUNITIES

05:16:07.848 --> 05:16:09.417
THAT ARE PARTICULARLY LIKELY TO

05:16:09.483 --> 05:16:13.154
BE AFFECTED REPEATEDLY BY THESE

05:16:13.220 --> 05:16:16.023
TYPES OF EVENTS AND THEN WHAT

05:16:16.090 --> 05:16:16.524
ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS.

05:16:16.590 --> 05:16:19.060
AVAILABLE SURE. AS YOU KNOW AS

05:16:19.126 --> 05:16:22.763
YOU IS. YOU KNOW THE COMPANIESLOOK AT MAKING THEIR

05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:23.631
INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE

05:16:23.698 --> 05:16:25.433
AND OTHER PARTS. HOW DO YOU

05:16:25.499 --> 05:16:26.033
MAKE SURE THAT YOU MAKE THOSE

05:16:26.100 --> 05:16:26.634
SPECIMENS IN THE PLACES THAT

05:16:26.701 --> 05:16:28.135
ARE. GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE

05:16:28.202 --> 05:16:29.737
BUCK AND JUST LIKE IN THIS PSP

05:16:29.804 --> 05:16:31.906
A CEMENT. THERE WAS A FOCUS ON

05:16:31.972 --> 05:16:33.974
FREE FOR THE PLACES WHERE AS-

05:16:34.041 --> 05:16:35.543
AS DIRECTOR GO DUTY TALKS ABOUT

05:16:35.609 --> 05:16:37.545
THE CASCADING ABOUT EMERGENCIES

05:16:37.611 --> 05:16:38.879
SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE KEY

05:16:38.946 --> 05:16:42.116
AREAS OF FOCUS- FOR- YES WAS

05:16:42.183 --> 05:16:43.184
LOOKING AT. WHAT'S HAPPENING

05:16:43.250 --> 05:16:45.453
WITH- WITH THE REFINERY WHAT'S

05:16:45.519 --> 05:16:46.420
HAPPENING WATER TREATMENT

05:16:46.487 --> 05:16:47.955
PLANTS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

05:16:48.022 --> 05:16:50.024
THE PLACES WHERE IF THEY LOSE

05:16:50.091 --> 05:16:51.892
POWER AND WE DON'T HAVE A BACK

05:16:51.959 --> 05:16:53.961
UP. THEN IT RESULTS IN ANOTHER.

05:16:54.028 --> 05:16:55.062
MENTAL CHALLENGE AT THE BACK

05:16:55.129 --> 05:16:56.764
AND WE CAN IT AND END UP WITH

05:16:56.831 --> 05:16:58.666
RELEASES INTO WATER INTO OUR

05:16:58.733 --> 05:17:01.602
WATER SOURCES IT CETERA. FLYING

05:17:01.669 --> 05:17:03.137
THAT SAME KIND OF ANALYSIS TO

05:17:03.204 --> 05:17:06.440
FIGURING OUT HOW TO PRIOR. AS A

05:17:06.507 --> 05:17:10.478
HARDENING BECAUSE. HOW

05:17:10.544 --> 05:17:11.812
DECISIONS GET MADE PART OF THIS

05:17:11.879 --> 05:17:12.813
IS AROUND HOW DO YOU MITIGATE.

05:17:12.880 --> 05:17:13.481
HOW DO YOU MITIGATE RISK IN THE

05:17:13.547 --> 05:17:14.749
POTENTIAL OF THE LOCATION OF

05:17:14.815 --> 05:17:15.282
PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES

05:17:15.349 --> 05:17:17.785
BECAUSE- PREVENTING A FIRE. BUT

05:17:17.852 --> 05:17:20.688
CAN BE VERY QUICKLY PUT OUT- IS

05:17:20.755 --> 05:17:21.856
DIFFERENT THAN PREVENTING A

05:17:21.922 --> 05:17:24.058
FIRE. IN AN AREA WHERE IT'S

05:17:24.125 --> 05:17:25.726
GOING TO BE HARDER TO FIGHT IT

05:17:25.793 --> 05:17:27.962
WHERE WE YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S

05:17:28.028 --> 05:17:29.063
GOING TO HAVE PREVENTING A FIRE

05:17:29.130 --> 05:17:31.165
OUTSIDE OF A LARGE URBAN AREA

05:17:31.232 --> 05:17:32.333
VERSUS PREVENTING A FIRE.

05:17:32.400 --> 05:17:34.902
OUTSIDE IN AN AREA THAT'S NOT

05:17:34.969 --> 05:17:37.271
THE SPARSELY POPULATED. NOT ALL

05:17:37.338 --> 05:17:38.873
THE SAME THING AND THAT'S SOME

05:17:38.939 --> 05:17:41.442
OF THE IMPULSES THAT. THAT IS

05:17:41.509 --> 05:17:44.678
UNDER WAY. IS REALLY LOOKING

05:17:44.745 --> 05:17:46.213
AT. WHAT WHAT WHERE IS IT YOU

05:17:46.280 --> 05:17:48.048
KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE RISK.

05:17:48.115 --> 05:17:49.683
ANALYSIS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS

05:17:49.750 --> 05:17:51.552
DATA WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENTS

05:17:51.619 --> 05:17:53.421
THAT ARE GOING TO MAKE THE

05:17:53.487 --> 05:17:55.122
BIGGEST CHANGE AS QUICKLY AS

05:17:55.189 --> 05:17:57.158
POSSIBLE HOW DO YOU LOOK AT YOU

05:17:57.224 --> 05:17:59.260
KNOW THIS IS A COMMUNITY THAT

05:17:59.326 --> 05:18:00.995
IS GOING TO BE REPEATEDLY

05:18:01.061 --> 05:18:02.730
IMPACTED AND WHAT IS THE-

05:18:02.797 --> 05:18:04.331
SOLUTION AND THAT IS PART OF.

05:18:04.398 --> 05:18:06.000
YOU KNOW THAT IS PART OF WHAT

05:18:06.066 --> 05:18:07.701
EVERYONE HERE IN MANY PEOPLE

05:18:07.768 --> 05:18:09.970
NOT ERE ARE WORKING ON- A PART

05:18:10.037 --> 05:18:11.739
OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN CHARGED WITH

05:18:11.806 --> 05:18:13.574
IS LOOKING AT. WHAT IS A GRID

05:18:13.641 --> 05:18:14.909
OF THE FUTURE NEED TO LOOK LIKE

05:18:14.975 --> 05:18:16.243
TO SUPPORT OUR CLEAN ENERGY

05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:18.813
TOOLS- HOW DO WE NEED TO- AND

05:18:18.879 --> 05:18:21.215
HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE GET TO A

05:18:21.282 --> 05:18:22.783
GRID THAT IS MORE RESILIENT

05:18:22.850 --> 05:18:24.485
TRANSMISSION AND THAT IS MORE

05:18:24.552 --> 05:18:26.153
RESULTS. IN LIGHT OF WHERE WE

05:18:26.220 --> 05:18:28.656
ARE IN IN IN- CLIMATE CHANGE

05:18:28.722 --> 05:18:30.591
AND HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE

05:18:30.658 --> 05:18:32.026
SAW FOR ALL OF THESE. OUTLINED

05:18:32.092 --> 05:18:33.661
AND WE DON'T THE SENSE OF

05:18:33.727 --> 05:18:34.628
THERE'S A FALSE DICHOTOMY OR

05:18:34.695 --> 05:18:36.363
FULL CHOICES BUT WE REALLY LOOK

05:18:36.430 --> 05:18:38.666
AT ONE OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS TO

05:18:38.732 --> 05:18:39.500
DEPLOY AGAINST THESE CHALLENGES

05:18:39.567 --> 05:18:40.668
IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO MAKE

05:18:40.734 --> 05:18:45.940
CALIFORNIA A- SAFER. CLEANER.

IDIOT STEPS THAT ARE UNDER WAY.

05:20:16.630 --> 05:20:20.200
AS I A IS A IS A PRISON BUDGET

05:20:20.267 --> 05:20:21.735
HAS SPOKEN TO THERE ARE THERE

05:20:21.802 --> 05:20:22.803
IS BOTH THE WITH THE WORK ON

05:20:22.870 --> 05:20:23.804
THE INVESTIGATION THE

05:20:23.871 --> 05:20:25.806
INVESTIGATION REFORM-

INFORMING. REVISED PROTOCOLS

05:20:28.609 --> 05:20:29.810
THEY REALLY TAKE A BROADER LOOK

05:20:29.877 --> 05:20:31.512
AT PUBLIC SAFETY NOT JUST

05:20:31.579 --> 05:20:33.881
FOCUSED ON. THE RISK OF CAUSING

05:20:33.948 --> 05:20:35.883
A WILDFIRE ALSO RECOGNIZING

05:20:35.950 --> 05:20:37.785
THAT THERE ARE LIVES ON EVERY

05:20:37.851 --> 05:20:38.886
SIDE OF THE ANGLE HERE AND-

05:20:38.953 --> 05:20:40.287
THESE DECISIONS REALLY NEED TO

05:20:40.354 --> 05:20:41.622
BE. GETTING INTO ACCOUNT THE

05:20:41.689 --> 05:20:42.890
IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY MORE

05:20:42.957 --> 05:20:44.925
BROADLY- THERE IS THE WORK THE

05:20:44.992 --> 05:20:46.994
ANALYSIS OF THEIR MENTION

05:20:47.061 --> 05:20:52.633
AROUND THE RISK ASSESSMENT. AND

05:20:52.700 --> 05:20:57.504
UNDERSTANDING. WHAT COMMUNITIES

05:20:57.571 --> 05:20:58.706
ARE MOST AT RISK. THERE ARE-

05:20:58.772 --> 05:20:59.573
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK UNDER

05:20:59.640 --> 05:21:00.474
WAY ON. WHAT IS IT YOU YOU

05:21:00.541 --> 05:21:01.875
ESTABLISHED ALL OF THE GOALS-

05:21:01.942 --> 05:21:03.310
FOR- TEN FIFTY FOUR AND FOUR P.

05:21:03.377 --> 05:21:03.777
JEANNIE COMING OUT OF

BANKRUPTCY. YOU ARE WORKING. AS

05:21:06.680 --> 05:21:08.215
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO BRING-

05:21:08.282 --> 05:21:11.619
MORE SPACE. TO WHAT WE THINK

05:21:11.685 --> 05:21:12.653
THOSE GOALS MIGHT MEAN AND AT

05:21:12.720 --> 05:21:14.655
THE END THE P. B. WILL MAKE ITS

05:21:14.722 --> 05:21:16.590
DETERMINATION AROUND. WHAT IS A

05:21:16.657 --> 05:21:18.292
NOR TIONAL STRUCTURE THAT IS

05:21:18.359 --> 05:21:19.994
NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A

05:21:20.060 --> 05:21:21.695
SAFE. OTHER WE HAVE UTILITY

05:21:21.762 --> 05:21:22.830
THAT IS GOING TO OPERATE

05:21:22.896 --> 05:21:25.799
SAFELY- AND- WHAT WHAT IS THE

05:21:25.866 --> 05:21:27.067
GREAT NEEDS TO LOOK LIKE WHAT

05:21:27.134 --> 05:21:28.135
IT WHAT IS THE OPERATIONAL

05:21:28.202 --> 05:21:29.937
STRUCTURES CAN BE MORE NIMBLE

05:21:30.004 --> 05:21:33.974
SO IT'S ALL IT'S ALL OF THOSE

05:21:34.041 --> 05:21:34.575
ARE. WORK ON THE WAY KEY TIME

05:21:34.642 --> 05:21:38.145
LINES. THANK IN THE THEY KNOW

SEE YOU THE JUNE THIRTIETH

05:21:42.016 --> 05:21:43.350
TIMELINE IS A CRITICAL TIME-

05:21:43.417 --> 05:21:45.352
AREA AND WE'RE WORKING ON. IT

05:21:45.419 --> 05:21:46.720
AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S THE

05:21:46.787 --> 05:21:48.989
FIRST STEPS IN BETWEEN NOW AND

05:21:49.056 --> 05:21:51.392
THEN AND WE'RE WORKING ON ALL

05:21:51.458 --> 05:21:51.992
OF THEM HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS

05:21:52.059 --> 05:21:54.862
THE QUESTION YEAH. WITH THE

05:21:54.928 --> 05:21:56.597
FALL OF BUT I THINK THE OTHER

05:21:56.664 --> 05:21:57.197
PIECE THAT I HAVE SOME REAL

05:21:57.264 --> 05:21:58.198
CONCERN ABOUT JUST BEING CANDID

05:21:58.265 --> 05:21:59.066
ABOUT AS WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN.

05:21:59.133 --> 05:22:02.936
THE CEOS WORK HERE IS IT BE

05:22:03.003 --> 05:22:03.537
NEAR PERFORMANCE METRICS INTO

05:22:03.604 --> 05:22:06.774
LAW. HIS CAN'T BE THE ONLY WAY

05:22:06.840 --> 05:22:08.142
TO. GET OUT OF THIS MESS. A IS

05:22:08.208 --> 05:22:08.709
MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE

ACTIONS IN THEIR INVESTMENT.

05:22:26.427 --> 05:22:27.661
ANY WE NEED TO GET AWAY FROM

05:22:27.728 --> 05:22:29.930
THE BIG DISCUSSIONS ABOUT.

05:22:29.997 --> 05:22:31.532
THIRTY BILLION. IN TO BILLION.

05:22:31.598 --> 05:22:33.133
TALKING ABOUT. MILES A MONTH

05:22:33.200 --> 05:22:35.102
THIS CAN BE MODERNIZE. WHAT'S

05:22:35.169 --> 05:22:36.603
GOING TO BE DEPLOYED ON THE

ASSURANCE THAT THE ICE WILL BE

05:24:58.946 --> 05:25:03.917

NOW GONE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

05:25:07.521 --> 05:25:09.489
FREEZER CAPACITY AND THEY SAY

METRIC. WE GET ICE AT THAT

05:25:18.866 --> 05:25:22.236
CENTER SOUL BACK WE ARE JOB

ALL WITH P. JEANNIE IN THIS

05:25:29.509 --> 05:25:31.278
CASE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE

05:25:31.345 --> 05:25:32.980
COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS HAVE

05:25:33.046 --> 05:25:37.017
THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED

05:25:37.084 --> 05:25:37.517
THAT THAT ADDRESS TO THE

05:25:37.584 --> 05:25:40.854
DETAILS AND IF THEY CAN'T DO IT.

05:25:40.921 --> 05:25:42.222
HELP THEM GET THERE AND THAT'S

05:25:42.289 --> 05:25:42.823
IN ESSENCE WHAT WE DID ON THIS

05:25:42.890 --> 05:25:43.423
LAST GO AROUND BUT THERE EAT

05:25:43.490 --> 05:25:44.057
THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF INCIDENT

05:25:44.124 --> 05:25:45.759
MANAGEMENT. NEEDS TO CHANGE TO

05:25:45.826 --> 05:25:47.294
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU'RE

05:25:47.361 --> 05:25:48.495
RUNNING A MAJOR DISASTER

05:25:48.562 --> 05:25:50.464
OPERATION DETAIL MATTER AND YOU

05:25:50.530 --> 05:25:51.732
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT FROM NOT

05:25:51.798 --> 05:25:54.902
A THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW.

05:25:54.968 --> 05:25:55.936
BUT UP FROM ON THE GROUND IN

05:25:56.003 --> 05:25:57.537
THAT'S ONE REASON IT TALKS

05:25:57.604 --> 05:25:58.739
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

05:25:58.805 --> 05:26:00.007
REIMBURSEMENT OF LOCAL

05:26:00.073 --> 05:26:01.875

STOP AFTER EIGHT PM. THIS IS

05:26:12.853 --> 05:26:13.887
WELL SO I THINK THAT'S THE

05:26:13.954 --> 05:26:14.521
OTHER PIECE THAT WE NEED TO BE

05:26:14.588 --> 05:26:16.056
FOCUSING ON IS A PRIOR TO THE

05:26:16.123 --> 05:26:18.225
LIGHTS GOING OUT. IF THEY NEED

05:26:18.292 --> 05:26:19.860
TO GO OUT. AT THAT WE HAVE

05:26:19.927 --> 05:26:21.962
STANDARDS IN PLACE SO THAT THE

05:26:22.029 --> 05:26:23.397
PUBLIC IS WHAT RESOURCES

05:26:23.463 --> 05:26:25.599

05:29:41.995 --> 05:29:44.731
MOVING CRITICAL SERVICES OUT

05:29:44.798 --> 05:29:47.868
THE DOOR RIGHT NOW- SO I JUST

05:29:47.934 --> 05:29:49.669
WANNA GET YOURS SENSE OF HOW.

05:29:49.736 --> 05:29:52.706
IF THERE TO WAIT A- I THINK THE

05:29:52.772 --> 05:29:53.607
LAW GIVES YOU ALL SOME

05:29:53.673 --> 05:29:56.076
DISCRETION TO NOT JUST GOING TO

05:29:56.143 --> 05:29:57.544
ONE YEAR IN A THREE YEAR TIME

05:29:57.611 --> 05:29:58.345
LINE BUT ON SOMETHING MORE

05:29:58.411 --> 05:30:00.280
TRUNCATED FOR A FOR THIS

05:30:00.347 --> 05:30:02.082
SMALLER DISCRETE PIECE BUT- I

05:30:02.149 --> 05:30:03.416
WANT TO GET A SENSE OF IF THERE

05:30:03.483 --> 05:30:05.118
WAS OPEN THIS TO THAT AND TRY

05:30:05.185 --> 05:30:06.253
TO GET SOME. SO THERE'S

05:30:06.319 --> 05:30:07.554
DEMONSTRABLE PROGRESS EVEN

05:30:07.621 --> 05:30:09.389
BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR

05:30:09.456 --> 05:30:09.956
BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GONNA

05:30:10.023 --> 05:30:12.259
HAVE. A SERIES OF INCIDENTS.

05:30:12.325 --> 05:30:13.393
GOING ON A HOLIDAY SEASON. WELL

05:30:13.460 --> 05:30:15.795

HAD MENTIONED EARLIER- RIGHT

05:30:17.964 --> 05:30:19.766
AWAY WE CALLED AN EMERGENCY.

05:30:19.833 --> 05:30:21.568
MEETING AND THAT WAS FOR THE

05:30:21.635 --> 05:30:24.204
PURPOSES. ASKING GINNY

05:30:24.271 --> 05:30:26.139
SPECIFICALLY. WHAT THEY HAD

05:30:26.206 --> 05:30:28.375
DONE WHY THEY HAD DONE IT AND

05:30:28.441 --> 05:30:29.009
FRANKLY WHY THEY HADN'T DONE IT

05:30:29.075 --> 05:30:32.612
BETTER. AND THAT WAS- BEFORE

05:30:32.679 --> 05:30:33.980
THE EVENTS IN LATE OCTOBER THAT

05:30:34.047 --> 05:30:36.082
WAS A FOR TWINS. AND I DO THINK

05:30:36.149 --> 05:30:37.384
THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

05:30:37.450 --> 05:30:39.352
WERE BROUGHT UP THAT WERE THEIR

05:30:39.419 --> 05:30:41.454
SHORTCOMINGS THE C. R. LACUS

05:30:41.521 --> 05:30:42.589
YOUR SEATS AND THE LACK OF THE

05:30:42.656 --> 05:30:46.393
WEB'S. TANNING THE LACK OF

05:30:46.459 --> 05:30:46.993
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE LOCAL

05:30:47.060 --> 05:30:49.095
GOVERNMENTS AND THE TRIBES.

05:30:49.162 --> 05:30:50.030
THINGS THAT FRANKLY AT THE TIME

05:30:50.096 --> 05:30:51.264
AND I REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES

05:30:51.331 --> 05:30:53.333
ARE. IF YOU'RE AN EMERGENCY

05:30:53.400 --> 05:30:55.769
MANAGEMENT OR IF YOU'RE IN

05:30:55.835 --> 05:30:56.336
EVENT PLANNING FOR GOODNESS

05:30:56.403 --> 05:30:58.705
SAKE THESE ARE FAIRLY. EASY

05:30:58.772 --> 05:31:00.774
THINGS THAT YOU THINK OF AHEAD

05:31:00.840 --> 05:31:03.610
OF TIME AND YOU DO WELL AHEAD

05:31:03.677 --> 05:31:04.477
OF TIME YOU'RE NOT DOING IT AT

05:31:04.544 --> 05:31:07.948
THE MOMENT CRISIS. SO THAT WAS

05:31:08.014 --> 05:31:11.351
WELL POINTED OUT- TO- P.

IT WE ARE TRACKING THEIR

05:31:16.656 --> 05:31:19.292
IMPROVEMENT WEEKLY. I'M THEY

05:31:19.359 --> 05:31:21.228
ARE AS I ALSO MENTIONED WE HAVE

05:31:21.294 --> 05:31:23.063
A SHOW CAUSE HEARING COMING UP

05:31:23.129 --> 05:31:25.665
I DON'T KNOW THAT WILL IMPROVE

05:31:25.732 --> 05:31:26.233
THEIR ACTIVITIES I THINK OF

05:31:26.299 --> 05:31:28.368
JUST BRING OUT A VERY. A

05:31:28.435 --> 05:31:30.103
TRAINED LIGHT ON THE SITUATION

05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:31.972
AND HAVE THEM DEFEND WHY THEY

05:31:32.038 --> 05:31:33.807
SHOULDN'T BE SIGNED SANCTIONED

05:31:33.873 --> 05:31:35.508
HER FIND AT THE- MORE

05:31:35.575 --> 05:31:36.810
SPECIFICALLY. FOR BRINGING

05:31:36.876 --> 05:31:39.179
THEM. IN BEFORE THE COMMISSION

05:31:39.246 --> 05:31:42.282
THE REGULATOR. AS A PRIVILEGED

05:31:42.349 --> 05:31:44.484
A LICENSE AND CITY AND

05:31:44.551 --> 05:31:46.353
EXPLAINING WHAT THEY HAD DONE

05:31:46.419 --> 05:31:48.154
AND WHY AND WHAT WE REFER TO

05:31:48.221 --> 05:31:50.357
IMPROVE IN REAL TIME I DO THINK

05:31:50.423 --> 05:31:51.725
THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS MADE

05:31:51.791 --> 05:31:54.294
BUT EVENT AN EVENT TO IN

05:31:54.361 --> 05:31:57.497
OCTOBER. ARE THEY A 100% BETTER.

05:31:57.564 --> 05:31:58.198
THAT'S ALL THAT WE HAVE TALKED

05:31:58.265 --> 05:32:01.134
ABOUT WHAT IT WHAT I HOPE TO DO

05:32:01.201 --> 05:32:02.836
AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS DOING

05:32:02.902 --> 05:32:04.271
IS MAKING SURE THAT THE FIRE

05:32:04.337 --> 05:32:06.039
SEASON. THIS YEAR LOOKS NOTHING

05:32:06.106 --> 05:32:07.040
LIKE WHAT WE SAW ON OCTOBER IN

05:32:07.107 --> 05:32:08.875
TERMS. THE USE AN

05:32:08.942 --> 05:32:11.578
IMPLEMENTATION OF PS PS SO TO

05:32:11.645 --> 05:32:13.046
ANSWER YOU DIRECTLY I THAT THE

05:32:13.113 --> 05:32:15.649
REGULATORY SYSTEM IS NOT REALLY

05:32:15.715 --> 05:32:17.617
ESTABLISH OR SET UP. ACT

05:32:17.684 --> 05:32:19.486
QUICKLY I THINK WE PROBABLY ALL

05:32:19.552 --> 05:32:21.554
AGREE ON THAT UNFORTUNATELY.

05:32:21.621 --> 05:32:23.290
BUT WHAT WE CAN DO IS THE

05:32:23.356 --> 05:32:25.759
REGULATOR SHINE A BRIGHT LIGHT

05:32:25.825 --> 05:32:27.794
ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND WHAT

05:32:27.861 --> 05:32:29.162
THEY'RE NOT DOING AND WHAT THEY

05:32:29.229 --> 05:32:30.196
NEED TO BE DOING IF I CAN READ

05:32:30.263 --> 05:32:32.365
BETWEEN THE LINES THEN. WE WANT

05:32:32.432 --> 05:32:33.800
EXPEDITED ACTION AND FOR PEOPLE

05:32:33.867 --> 05:32:35.502
NOT TO GO SPEND THEIR CHRISTMAS

05:32:35.568 --> 05:32:37.570
BONUS ON A DIESEL GENERATOR

05:32:37.637 --> 05:32:39.339
THAT MIGHT LIKE THEIR HOUSE ON

05:32:39.406 --> 05:32:40.940
FIRE AND POLLUTE THEIR

05:32:41.007 --> 05:32:45.211
NEIGHBORHOOD- AND INSTEAD STATE

YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'LL BE

05:34:30.283 --> 05:34:32.252
BRIEF WE ESTIMATE THAT IN THE

05:34:32.318 --> 05:34:36.723
LAST PS PS EVENTS ABOUT

05:34:36.790 --> 05:34:38.358
200-100-0200 FIFTY THOUSAND

05:34:38.425 --> 05:34:38.992
IMPACTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE AYE

05:34:39.058 --> 05:34:42.295
HSS PROGRAM. THE NUMBER

05:34:42.362 --> 05:34:46.933
BASILIDES IN THOSE ZONES. ON

05:34:47.000 --> 05:34:47.934
THE PUBLIC SIDE WITH THE

05:34:48.001 --> 05:34:49.235
CAPACITY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS

05:34:49.302 --> 05:34:52.005
OF REST AND THEN ON THE I'M

05:34:52.071 --> 05:34:54.841
SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE YOU HAD

05:34:54.908 --> 05:34:55.742
NEARLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

05:34:55.809 --> 05:34:56.776
FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT

05:34:56.843 --> 05:34:59.212
INCLUDES- MANY OF THE CHILD

05:34:59.279 --> 05:35:01.247
CARE FACILITIES THAT RUN EIGHT

05:35:01.314 --> 05:35:02.415
TO FIVE RATHER THAN AROUND THE

05:35:02.482 --> 05:35:04.484
CLOCK. SO IN TOTAL YOU'RE

05:35:04.551 --> 05:35:07.387
LOOKING AT A. THOUSANDS OF

05:35:07.454 --> 05:35:09.022
POTENTIALLY IMPACTED PEOPLE WHO

05:35:09.088 --> 05:35:09.622
RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH STATE

05:35:09.689 --> 05:35:12.125
AID. THOSE THEIR WEIGHT IN

05:35:12.192 --> 05:35:13.893
OTHER WORDS TO HONE IN THAT

05:35:13.960 --> 05:35:16.596
UNIVERSE AND START GETTING-

05:35:16.663 --> 05:35:18.398
SOME KIND OF BACKUP SYSTEMS

05:35:18.465 --> 05:35:21.234
THAT ARE DIESEL GENERATORS OUT

05:35:21.301 --> 05:35:21.868
THE DOOR BEFORE THE END OF THIS

05:35:21.935 --> 05:35:26.172
YEAR TO THOSE PEOPLE. OWNER IN.

05:35:26.239 --> 05:35:27.740
THIS MODEST ON TOAST. LIKE A

05:35:27.807 --> 05:35:29.108
REASONABLE GOAL FOR US NOT

05:35:29.175 --> 05:35:31.678
WAITING UNTIL JANUARY NEXT YEAR

05:35:31.744 --> 05:35:32.779
BUT TRYING TO GET SOMETHING

05:35:32.846 --> 05:35:35.815
DONE- BEFORE THE HOLIDAY. SOME

05:35:35.882 --> 05:35:39.352
OF THE SOME OF THAT IS- IS

05:35:39.419 --> 05:35:39.886
HAPPENING AND AS A PRISON

05:35:39.953 --> 05:35:42.355
BADGERS. THE LEARNINGS ARE

05:35:42.422 --> 05:35:44.591
BEING IMPLEMENTED A TIME. AND

05:35:44.657 --> 05:35:46.726
THE WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE

05:35:46.793 --> 05:35:48.328
UTILITY SIDE OF WHAT'S

05:35:48.394 --> 05:35:49.229
HAPPENING ON THE GOVERNMENT

05:35:49.295 --> 05:35:50.830
SIDE IS CHANGING AT EVERY

05:35:50.897 --> 05:35:53.566
CORNER AND- SOME OF THE AREA OF

05:35:53.633 --> 05:35:55.235
FOCUS ON THE AREA OF THE

05:35:55.301 --> 05:35:56.002
PRIORITIES ARE THESE CLICK

05:35:56.069 --> 05:35:57.937
CRITICAL FACILITIES WHERE IF

05:35:58.004 --> 05:35:59.772
THEY DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY

05:35:59.839 --> 05:36:01.641
BUT THEN YOU HAVE THESE THESE

05:36:01.708 --> 05:36:03.576
OVERALL DOWNSTREAM EFFECTS SO-

05:36:03.643 --> 05:36:05.144
BUT IN IN IN TERMS OF THE

05:36:05.211 --> 05:36:06.913
BIGGER INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF

05:36:06.980 --> 05:36:08.648
THE OF THE LONGER TERM-

05:36:08.715 --> 05:36:11.284
ACTIONS. I THINK SOME OF THOSE

05:36:11.351 --> 05:36:12.585
WILL BE HAPPENING OVER TIME AND

05:36:12.652 --> 05:36:14.721
OF THE- WHAT THE QUESTIONS THAT

05:36:14.787 --> 05:36:16.022
WE ASK FOR THE UTILITY WAS IN

05:36:16.089 --> 05:36:17.657
THE FOR THE POOL IN THE PLACES

05:36:17.724 --> 05:36:20.393
WHERE THEY DEPLOYED- TECHNOLOGY

05:36:20.460 --> 05:36:22.061
AND THEY DEPLOY GENERATION WERE

05:36:22.128 --> 05:36:23.329
INTEREST IN WANTING TO

05:36:23.396 --> 05:36:23.863
UNDERSTAND HOW MANY PEOPLE

05:36:23.930 --> 05:36:25.164
ACTUALLY ACQUIRE THOSE SO THAT

05:36:25.231 --> 05:36:26.466
WE HAVE A SENSE OF FOR THE

05:36:26.533 --> 05:36:27.800
SOLUTIONS WHERE THEY WERE

05:36:27.867 --> 05:36:29.102
TEMPORARY ONES IN NATURE HOW

05:36:29.168 --> 05:36:30.970
MANY OF THOSE ARE ON. OUR OUR

05:36:31.037 --> 05:36:32.372
LONG TERM THE OTHER PIECE THAT

05:36:32.438 --> 05:36:33.273
I'D HIGHLIGHT IN TERMS OF WHAT

05:36:33.339 --> 05:36:35.608
THE CAPACITY GENERATION IS IT

05:36:35.675 --> 05:36:36.442
COULD BE THAT THE INITIAL

05:36:36.509 --> 05:36:38.511
SOLUTION THAT GETS IMPLEMENTED

05:36:38.578 --> 05:36:40.079
IS A DIESEL GENERATOR BUT THAT

05:36:40.146 --> 05:36:41.581
CAN BE SWAPPED OUT WITH A

05:36:41.648 --> 05:36:43.883
CLEANER- CLEANER SOURCE- IN

05:36:43.950 --> 05:36:46.452
STORAGE SO PART OF THIS IS HOW

05:36:46.519 --> 05:36:48.688
DO WE GET THE RIGHT KIND OF- OF

05:36:48.755 --> 05:36:50.189
GRADE AND STRUCTURE IN PLACE.

05:36:50.256 --> 05:36:52.759
HOW DO YOU GET THE GENERATION-

05:36:52.825 --> 05:36:54.827
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO

05:36:54.894 --> 05:36:57.196
PROVIDE SERVICE IN A WAY. THAT

05:36:57.263 --> 05:36:58.898
YOU KNOW WORKS IN AND MINIMIZES

05:36:58.965 --> 05:37:00.767
PUBLIC SAFETY IMPACTS AND THEN

05:37:00.833 --> 05:37:02.368
OVER TIME HOW DO WE ENSURE IF

05:37:02.435 --> 05:37:03.870
IT TAKES TIME IF IT CAN'T BE

05:37:03.937 --> 05:37:05.672
DONE IN ONE FELL SWOOP HOW DO

05:37:05.738 --> 05:37:07.106
WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE KIND

05:37:07.173 --> 05:37:08.741
OF THE NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS

05:37:08.808 --> 05:37:10.843
THAT CAN BE MAPPED UP WITH THE-

05:37:10.910 --> 05:37:13.046
CLEAN INVESTMENTS TO GET US TO

05:37:13.112 --> 05:37:13.813
WHERE WE NEED TO GO CONSISTENT

05:37:13.880 --> 05:37:16.316
ONE OF OUR GOALS DO YOU. I MEAN

05:37:16.382 --> 05:37:16.950
IF I'M SCRAPING TOGETHER A

05:37:17.016 --> 05:37:18.952
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I'M A-

05:37:19.018 --> 05:37:21.020
CLASS FAMILY MAKING EIGHTY

05:37:21.087 --> 05:37:21.654
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS TO BUY

05:37:21.721 --> 05:37:23.256
THAT DIESEL GENERATOR YOU CAN'T

05:37:23.323 --> 05:37:26.192
SWAP THAT OUT YOU BOUGHT THAT

05:37:26.259 --> 05:37:27.160
DIESEL GENERATOR AND THAT'S

05:37:27.226 --> 05:37:33.766
KIND OF. SAID RIGHT I MEAN IT'S

05:37:33.833 --> 05:37:41.207
THE FOLKS GOVERNOR VISITED SO.

05:37:41.274 --> 05:37:42.442
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU SWAP THAT

05:37:42.508 --> 05:37:43.209
APPLE. I GUESS I THE ONE OF THE

05:37:43.276 --> 05:37:44.444
PIECES THAT WE NEED TO WORK

05:37:44.510 --> 05:37:45.278
TOWARDS IS HOW DO WE MINIMIZE.

05:37:45.345 --> 05:37:46.079
THIS OF P. SPS AT ALL SO THAT

05:37:46.145 --> 05:37:46.713
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT A LOT OF

05:37:46.779 --> 05:37:47.246
CALIFORNIANS GOING OUT AND

05:37:47.313 --> 05:37:48.114
BUYING TECHNOLOGY. FOR

05:37:48.181 --> 05:37:48.715
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USED

05:37:48.781 --> 05:37:50.383
SPARINGLY AND NOT AND NOT

05:37:50.450 --> 05:37:51.184
REQUIRE YOU WOULD JUST. TAPPING

05:37:51.250 --> 05:37:52.285
BACK MY PORTER RICO EXPERIENCE.

05:37:52.352 --> 05:37:53.953
WE DON'T WANT CALIFORNIA TO

05:37:54.020 --> 05:37:54.687
THINK THAT THEY'RE LIVING

05:37:54.754 --> 05:37:56.122
IMPORTER RICO BECAUSE THEY ARE

05:37:56.189 --> 05:37:58.224
NOT- WE HAVE A MUCH MORE

05:37:58.291 --> 05:38:01.127
RESILIENT SYSTEM. WE HAVE- WE

05:38:01.194 --> 05:38:02.328
CAN SEE FROM THE SAN DIEGO

05:38:02.395 --> 05:38:04.597
EXPERIENCE THAT- THAT WE HAVE A

05:38:04.664 --> 05:38:05.965
LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

05:38:06.032 --> 05:38:07.667
OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND

05:38:07.734 --> 05:38:08.901
I DON'T THINK THAT WE WANT TO

05:38:08.968 --> 05:38:10.236
CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE

05:38:10.303 --> 05:38:12.338
FOLKS SAY. THIS THIS THIS IS

05:38:12.405 --> 05:38:14.674
NOT A NEW NORMAL IT CANNOT BE

05:38:14.741 --> 05:38:16.009
IT WILL NOT BE. THERE ARE

05:38:16.075 --> 05:38:18.478
BETTER STRONGER SOLUTIONS AND I

05:38:18.544 --> 05:38:19.646
DON'T THINK WE WANT TO I DON'T

05:38:19.712 --> 05:38:20.747
THINK. WE WANT TO CREATE A

05:38:20.813 --> 05:38:22.115
SENSE OF. EVERYONE FEELS LIKE

05:38:22.181 --> 05:38:22.882
THEY HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE

05:38:22.949 --> 05:38:24.350
WRONG SOLUTION. BECAUSE THAT'S

05:38:24.417 --> 05:38:25.385
NOT GOING TO BE THE BEST FOR

05:38:25.451 --> 05:38:26.886
THE ENVIRONENT IT'S NOT GOING

05:38:26.953 --> 05:38:28.888
TO BE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE IT'S

05:38:28.955 --> 05:38:29.389
NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST

05:38:29.455 --> 05:38:30.223
AFFORDABLE AND IT'S NOT WHAT IS

05:38:30.289 --> 05:38:32.358

FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THE-

05:44:08.794 --> 05:44:11.697
ROAD TO THIS ISSUE AND I THINK

05:44:11.764 --> 05:44:13.632
WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF.

05:44:13.699 --> 05:44:15.201
COST ESTIMATOR OR THERE'S BEEN

05:44:15.267 --> 05:44:17.503
SOME MODELING DONE ON THAT I

05:44:17.570 --> 05:44:18.404
THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

05:44:18.471 --> 05:44:20.940
WE HAVE SOME CONSISTENT. HEROES

05:44:21.007 --> 05:44:25.478

TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT ISSUE I

05:44:26.412 --> 05:44:26.979
JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT

05:44:27.046 --> 05:44:28.714

05:44:33.119 --> 05:44:36.622
OF- ECONOMIC. OF WAYS OF DOING

05:44:36.689 --> 05:44:39.058
THAT AND IT WOULD BE VERY

05:44:39.125 --> 05:44:40.793
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT DONE

05:44:40.860 --> 05:44:43.162
IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY SO WE GET A

05:44:43.229 --> 05:44:45.564
HANDLE ON THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW

05:44:45.631 --> 05:44:46.132
WE WANT TO BE FAIR WE DON'T

BUT NOT THIS GROUP AND- THOSE

05:44:52.171 --> 05:44:54.740
KINDS OF THINGS REGARDING.

05:44:54.807 --> 05:44:57.309
POWER OUTAGE- COST TO

05:44:57.376 --> 05:44:59.412

IN THE MAKE RESPOND TO THAT

05:45:05.618 --> 05:45:10.489
QUESTION FIRST. THE EXISTING

05:45:10.556 --> 05:45:11.757
MODELS TO DO THAT OUR MODELS

05:45:11.824 --> 05:45:13.592
YEAH THEIR MODELS. THAT

05:45:13.659 --> 05:45:15.394
BERKELEY'S LIVERMORE YEAH RIGHT

05:45:15.461 --> 05:45:17.730
THERE'S A STANFORD ONE AND

05:45:17.797 --> 05:45:18.330
STANFORD WAS RELYING ON THAT

05:45:18.397 --> 05:45:19.231
MODEL TO DO THEIR OWN

05:45:19.298 --> 05:45:21.133
ESTIMATES. THEIR MDELS AND

05:45:21.200 --> 05:45:23.769
SOPHIE ONE ACTUAL ASSESSMENTS

05:45:23.836 --> 05:45:25.938
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO MORE

05:45:26.005 --> 05:45:29.475
STAFF COMPLETE. NERVOUS ABOUT

05:45:29.542 --> 05:45:30.543
WHAT THE REAL COSTS- COOLEY-

05:45:30.609 --> 05:45:31.277
LAWRENCE LIVERMORE RIGHT EXACT

05:45:31.343 --> 05:45:34.847
AS A MODEL IN. OKAY SO THEN THE

05:45:34.914 --> 05:45:37.083
OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS SO.

05:45:37.149 --> 05:45:40.453
THE SCENARIO OF FARM. THAT I

05:45:40.519 --> 05:45:41.821
PREFER AND WHEN I LOOK AT THESE

05:45:41.887 --> 05:45:44.156
THINGS SO. I LOOK AT TEN YEAR

05:45:44.223 --> 05:45:45.291
WHEN THEY SAY TEN YEARS THAT

05:45:45.357 --> 05:45:46.792
MEANS NOTHING TO MAKE US TEN

05:45:46.859 --> 05:45:51.831
YEARS TO FOR A RISE AND IT'S.

05:45:51.897 --> 05:45:52.731
YOU KNOW I'M USED TO

05:45:52.798 --> 05:45:53.399
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS LIKE ON A

05:45:53.466 --> 05:45:54.867
WORKING ENVIRONMENT SO TEN

05:45:54.934 --> 05:45:57.269
YEARS ISLIKE SAYING YOU'RE NOT

05:45:57.336 --> 05:45:57.837
GOING TO DO IT AND WE DON'T

05:45:57.903 --> 05:46:00.072
KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO DO IT.

05:46:00.139 --> 05:46:02.975
IT'S KIND OF LIKE. IT IS A

05:46:03.042 --> 05:46:05.111
MEANINGLESS STATEMENT OKAY. SO

05:46:05.177 --> 05:46:07.780
THAT'S WHY I SAY THREE YEARS.

05:46:07.847 --> 05:46:09.381
AND WE HAVE A SCENARIO

05:46:09.448 --> 05:46:12.885
DEVELOPED WHERE- ALL THE

05:46:12.952 --> 05:46:18.157
EQUIPMENT CAN BE. WORKED ON IN

05:46:18.224 --> 05:46:19.758
THREE YEARS AND THEN IN

05:46:19.825 --> 05:46:22.495
ADDITION TO THAT ISSUE. GETTING

05:46:22.561 --> 05:46:25.297
BACK TO THE MODELING- WHEN YOU

05:46:25.364 --> 05:46:28.467
LOOK AT- REDUCING REDUCING THE

05:46:28.534 --> 05:46:31.137
POWER INTERRUPTION AND REDUCING

05:46:31.203 --> 05:46:33.439
THE COST OF THAT WILL HAVE A

05:46:33.506 --> 05:46:35.207
POSITIVE ECONOMIC AFFECT ON

05:46:35.274 --> 05:46:37.743
CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN CUT THAT

05:46:37.810 --> 05:46:39.645
TEN YEARS DOWN TO THREE YEARS

05:46:39.712 --> 05:46:40.846
AND HOW DO WE HOW DO WE

05:46:40.913 --> 05:46:43.983
ENCOURAGE. THAT SCENARIO FROM

05:46:44.049 --> 05:46:46.852
AN ECONOMIC STANDPOINT I KNOW

05:46:46.919 --> 05:46:49.255
THE MODEL I KNOW. WHAT I'VE

05:46:49.321 --> 05:46:50.556
STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE

05:46:50.623 --> 05:46:53.192
ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THIS IS NOT

05:46:53.259 --> 05:46:55.694
SO MUCH ONE ERUPTION DEBTS THE

05:46:55.761 --> 05:46:58.998
REPEATED ON GOING YEAR AFTER

05:46:59.064 --> 05:47:01.000
YEAR AFTER YEAR OF

05:47:01.066 --> 05:47:03.169
INTERRUPTIONS WHEN THE-

05:47:03.235 --> 05:47:05.371
BUSINESSES SORT OF TIRE OF THIS

05:47:05.437 --> 05:47:07.940
THE- INSURANCE COMPANIES TIRE

05:47:08.007 --> 05:47:10.276
OF THIS AND ALSO A NEW ECONOMY

05:47:10.342 --> 05:47:13.546
IS. JUST OVER TIME THE

05:47:13.612 --> 05:47:16.182
INTERRUPTION JUST HAS A HUGE.

05:47:16.248 --> 05:47:18.184
IT IMPACT IN TERMS OF THE

05:47:18.250 --> 05:47:19.919
ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA SO LOOK

05:47:19.985 --> 05:47:21.654
AT THE NEXT I'M LOOKING AT A

05:47:21.720 --> 05:47:23.189
TEN YEAR DECADE OF THAT THAT'S

05:47:23.255 --> 05:47:25.024
NOT GOING TO BE THAT'S NOT AN

05:47:25.090 --> 05:47:27.560
ACCEPTABLE THING. I MEAN WE

05:47:27.626 --> 05:47:29.428
CAN'T HAVE. THAT KIND OF.

05:47:29.495 --> 05:47:31.697
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ON THE

05:47:31.764 --> 05:47:32.965
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW

05:47:33.032 --> 05:47:35.634
I REPRESENT. A MILLION PEOPLE

05:47:35.701 --> 05:47:38.938
OF IN SILICON VALLEY- WE'RE

05:47:39.004 --> 05:47:41.707
DOING PRETTY GOOD ON ECONOMY

05:47:41.774 --> 05:47:42.274
BUT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

05:47:42.341 --> 05:47:44.510
COMPANIES THAT ARE. THEY'RE

05:47:44.577 --> 05:47:47.046
KIND OF LOOK AT THIS AND YOU

05:47:47.112 --> 05:47:47.613
KNOW THEY DON'T KNOW IF THEY

05:47:47.680 --> 05:47:50.382
WANT TO CONTINUE THEIR HIGH

05:47:50.449 --> 05:47:52.851
ENERGY USERS- THEY'RE WORRIED

05:47:52.918 --> 05:47:56.222
ABOUT BACKUP POWER- THERE IS

05:47:56.288 --> 05:47:57.923
PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR

05:47:57.990 --> 05:47:58.457
THEY'RE NOT SAYING THEY'RE

05:47:58.524 --> 05:47:59.024
GOING TO LEAVE BUT THEY'RE

05:47:59.091 --> 05:48:01.193
NERVOUS ABOUT IT. THIS IS

05:48:01.260 --> 05:48:02.294
MAKING PEOPLE VERY VERY

05:48:02.361 --> 05:48:05.431
NERVOUS. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

05:48:05.497 --> 05:48:06.932
TEN YEARS THAT WAS THAT THAT

05:48:06.999 --> 05:48:09.735
WAS- THAT HAD A NERVE TEN YEARS

05:48:09.802 --> 05:48:12.504
THAT HIT A NERVE. SO WE HAVE TO

05:48:12.571 --> 05:48:14.240
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME.

05:48:14.306 --> 05:48:18.210
SCENARIOS THAT ARE. FASTER TO

05:48:18.277 --> 05:48:21.847
FIND TO FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN DO

05:48:21.914 --> 05:48:24.650
IT IN THREE YEARS IS THAT IS

05:48:24.717 --> 05:48:28.120
THAT A SOONER WE CAN- LOOK OUT

05:48:28.187 --> 05:48:28.721
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD IT

05:48:28.787 --> 05:48:30.689
SEEMS TO ME HAVE PRETTY. HUGE

05:48:30.756 --> 05:48:33.292
MAGNITUDE FISCAL AND ECONOMIC

05:48:33.359 --> 05:48:35.961
IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA A LOT OF

05:48:36.028 --> 05:48:36.495
JOBS WILL BE LOST YOU KNOW

05:48:36.562 --> 05:48:37.930
WE'RE TALKING. A LOT OF THINGS

05:48:37.997 --> 05:48:41.700
HAPPENING. I WOULD THOSE THIRTY

05:48:41.767 --> 05:48:43.002
RESPONSE TO THAT- JUST SAY

05:48:43.068 --> 05:48:45.571
UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED- HI TO WE

05:48:45.638 --> 05:48:46.939
AND THAT'S PART OF WHY ARE

05:48:47.006 --> 05:48:49.208
FOCUSING CHARGE IS AROUND WHAT

05:48:49.275 --> 05:48:51.443
NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT WEEK NEXT

05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:52.678
MONTH IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS

05:48:52.745 --> 05:48:54.613
THE NEXT THE- IN THE NEXUS SIX

05:48:54.680 --> 05:48:56.248
NINE MONTHS TO ASSURE THAT NEXT

05:48:56.315 --> 05:48:57.750
YEAR IS NOT THIS YEAR OF THE

05:48:57.816 --> 05:48:58.717
YEAR AFTER THAT IS BETTER THAN

05:48:58.784 --> 05:49:01.520
THE YEAR BEFORE- BECAUSE THE

05:49:01.587 --> 05:49:02.955
DISRUPTIVE EFFECT THE

05:49:03.022 --> 05:49:05.057
UNCERTAINTY ALL OF THOSE THINGS

05:49:05.124 --> 05:49:07.192
ARE A CHALLENGE FOR- OTHER

05:49:07.259 --> 05:49:08.394
CHALLENGE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS

05:49:08.460 --> 05:49:10.429
ARE ON ACCEPTABLE AND- AND WE

05:49:10.496 --> 05:49:12.898
NEED TO. WORK TOWARDS MAKING

05:49:12.965 --> 05:49:14.466
THE CHANGES ARE YOU KNOW

05:49:14.533 --> 05:49:17.703
CULTURAL- ORGANIZATIONAL-

05:49:17.770 --> 05:49:19.705
INFRASTRUCTURE WAS THAT NEED TO

05:49:19.772 --> 05:49:22.908
OCCUR TO MAKE THE USE OF PSP S.

05:49:22.975 --> 05:49:25.844
SPARING AND- AND IDEALLY WERE

05:49:25.911 --> 05:49:27.346
TIME FACED OUT THE NOT UNKNOWN

05:49:27.413 --> 05:49:28.347
OR ARE YOU A SHOE IS INSURANCE

05:49:28.414 --> 05:49:31.317
ISSUE AND AGAIN I THINK THE ONE

05:49:31.383 --> 05:49:35.421
TIME LOOK AT ECONOMIC IMPACT.

05:49:35.487 --> 05:49:39.525
MIGHT BE SMALL. IT MIGHT NOT BE

05:49:39.591 --> 05:49:40.959
I DON'T KNOW OF BUT THE

05:49:41.026 --> 05:49:43.862
REPEATED ON GOING. POWER

05:49:43.929 --> 05:49:47.733
SHORTAGE OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD.

05:49:47.800 --> 05:49:49.935
AND THE AND THE COST TO THE

05:49:50.002 --> 05:49:52.571
CONSUMER AND BUSINESS I THINK

05:49:52.638 --> 05:49:54.206
IT'S MORE OF A COST TO BUSINESS

05:49:54.273 --> 05:49:56.008
AND RESIDENTIAL WHEN I SAW THE

05:49:56.075 --> 05:49:57.009
MODELS IT LOOKS LIKE THE

05:49:57.076 --> 05:50:00.379
BUSINESS IMPACT WAS MUCH DOLLAR

05:50:00.446 --> 05:50:04.516
WISE A BIGGER. A BIGGER IMPACT.

05:50:04.583 --> 05:50:06.819
IF WE HAVE THIS ON A REPEATED

05:50:06.885 --> 05:50:08.020
BASIS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF

05:50:08.087 --> 05:50:12.458
TIME. OF THAT WOULD HAVE A HUGE

05:50:12.524 --> 05:50:14.326
A MUCH BIGGER ECONOMIC

05:50:14.393 --> 05:50:15.861
CONSEQUENCE OF MY RIGHT IN

05:50:15.928 --> 05:50:18.263
TERMS OF THE COST TO INSURANCE

05:50:18.330 --> 05:50:19.231
AND THEN AND THEN MAYBE

05:50:19.298 --> 05:50:21.467
INSURANCE PEOPLE WITHDRAWING

05:50:21.533 --> 05:50:26.705
FROM PROVIDING INSURANCE- TO-

05:50:26.772 --> 05:50:27.339
OF OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA

05:50:27.406 --> 05:50:29.775
WHICH WILL. WORST BE ANOTHER

05:50:29.842 --> 05:50:31.410
THING THAT WILL CAUSE THEM TO

05:50:31.477 --> 05:50:31.977
WANT TO LEAVE CALIFORNIA IN

05:50:32.044 --> 05:50:35.047
THAT SENSE. YOU ARE CORRECT THE

05:50:35.114 --> 05:50:40.018
ONGOING AND SUSTAINED. ACTIVITY

05:50:40.085 --> 05:50:41.053
OF THIS SORT WOULD BE REALLY

05:50:41.120 --> 05:50:44.790
DAMAGING AND THE- SERVING THAT

05:50:44.857 --> 05:50:46.825
WE'VE DONE OF BUSINESSES AND

05:50:46.892 --> 05:50:48.093
VISITORS SO FAR IT HAS NOT BEEN

05:50:48.160 --> 05:50:50.629
THAT DAMAGING BUT IF IT

05:50:50.696 --> 05:50:51.230
CONTINUES AT ABSOLUTELY COULD

05:50:51.296 --> 05:50:53.899
BE AND I AGREE WITH YOU. CENTER

05:50:53.966 --> 05:50:55.634
WITH ELEMENT LIKE A SCENARIO TO

05:50:55.701 --> 05:50:58.003
BE DEVELOPED ON A THREE YEAR

05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.704
THAT'S WHAT BASE I THINK IT'S

05:50:58.771 --> 05:51:02.107
TOO. IT WOULD HELP TOO MUCH IN

05:51:02.174 --> 05:51:02.674
MY EAR AND I WOULD HAVE TOO

05:51:02.741 --> 05:51:06.278
MUCH OF A CONSEQUENCE SO. AND

CASES OF PEOPLE LOSING FOOD IN

06:03:16.474 --> 06:03:18.209
THEIR REFRIGERATORS AND IF YOU

06:03:22.080 --> 06:03:23.281
THING TO LOSE HUNDREDS OF

06:03:23.348 --> 06:03:25.817

PREVENTED FROM GOING TO WORK-

06:03:33.992 --> 06:03:35.026
BECAUSE EITHER THE CLIENT WAS

NO LONGER AT THE HOME WHERE

06:03:36.394 --> 06:03:37.762

CLIENT HAD BEEN EVACUATED TO.

06:03:40.365 --> 06:03:42.467

06:03:48.173 --> 06:03:48.873
MOVING ON. THE ISSUE

06:03:48.940 --> 06:03:50.341
TRANSPORTATION HAS TO BE

06:03:50.408 --> 06:03:52.577
ADDRESSED IN MANY OF THESE

06:03:52.644 --> 06:03:54.312
PLACES INCLUDING THE RURAL

06:03:54.379 --> 06:03:56.181
AREAS THESE FOLKS DO NOT HAVE

06:03:56.247 --> 06:03:57.882
TRANSPORTATION TO EVEN GET. TO

06:03:57.949 --> 06:03:59.350
THE OPEN CHARGING FACILITIES

06:03:59.417 --> 06:04:00.919
AND I DIDN'T HEAR MUCH

06:04:00.985 --> 06:04:03.454
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AT ALL SO

06:04:03.521 --> 06:04:04.656
IF YOU AREN'T ABLE TO GET

06:04:04.722 --> 06:04:07.158
THERE- THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM TO

06:04:07.225 --> 06:04:08.960
BEGIN WITH I WAS TOLD OVER AND

06:04:09.027 --> 06:04:11.262
OVER THAT THE UNCERTAINTY. WAS

06:04:11.329 --> 06:04:13.665
A HUGE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE

06:04:13.731 --> 06:04:15.366
WARNINGS THAT ARE ISSUED ARE

06:04:15.433 --> 06:04:17.869
VERY LARGE AND THEY SAY YOU MAY

06:04:17.936 --> 06:04:19.604
YOU MAY HAVE YOUR SHOUT A POWER

06:04:19.671 --> 06:04:21.706
SHUT OFF. BUT IT'S UNCLEAR IF

06:04:21.773 --> 06:04:24.742
YOU WOULD HAVE IT SO THAT-

06:04:24.809 --> 06:04:26.211
PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE WHERE THEY

06:04:26.277 --> 06:04:27.812
WERE GOING TO BE IF THEIR POWER

06:04:27.879 --> 06:04:29.113
WAS SHUT OFF AND IT WAS

06:04:29.180 --> 06:04:30.148
ENTIRELY UNCLEAR WHEN IT WOULD

06:04:30.215 --> 06:04:32.850
GET RESTORED. OR AS IT HAS BEEN

06:04:32.917 --> 06:04:34.352
MENTIONED IT WOULD SAY ONE TIME

06:04:34.419 --> 06:04:35.787
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THAT TIME

06:04:35.853 --> 06:04:37.355
IT WAS ANOTHER TIME. AND THEN

06:04:37.422 --> 06:04:39.557
WE'LL WE'RE- FINDING IS FOLKS

06:04:39.624 --> 06:04:41.025
WHO THEN BECAUSE THEY WERE

06:04:41.092 --> 06:04:42.260
BEING WORN BUT NEVER ACTUALLY

06:04:42.327 --> 06:04:43.628
HAD THEIR POWER SHUT OFF FOR

06:04:43.695 --> 06:04:46.231
NOW. DISREGARDING THE WARNINGS

06:04:46.297 --> 06:04:47.498
BECAUSE OF JUST A NATURAL

06:04:47.565 --> 06:04:49.534
INCLINATION TO NOT BELIEVE THEM

06:04:49.601 --> 06:04:50.602
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T APPLY TO

06:04:50.668 --> 06:04:52.437
THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I

06:04:52.503 --> 06:04:54.272
THINK THE BOTTOM LINE THAT YOU

06:04:54.339 --> 06:04:56.541
CAN TAKE FROM- WHAT MY

06:04:56.608 --> 06:04:57.642
COLLEAGUE CHRISTINA AND I HAVE

06:04:57.709 --> 06:04:59.510
THAT ARE SAYING IS THAT. FOR

06:04:59.577 --> 06:05:01.045
THE MOST PART THERE IS NOT

06:05:01.112 --> 06:05:02.480
ADEQUATE PREPARATION IN TERMS

06:05:02.547 --> 06:05:04.716
OF PEOPLE FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE

06:05:04.782 --> 06:05:06.951
AND WHO HAVE A ACCESS

06:05:07.018 --> 06:05:07.852
FUNCTIONAL NEEDS. AND THE

06:05:07.919 --> 06:05:11.489
ADEQUATE MEASURES HAVE MOVE FOR

06:05:11.556 --> 06:05:17.095
THE MOST PART NOT BEEN TAKEN.

06:05:17.161 --> 06:05:18.296
THE STEPS THAT I WANT TO OFFER

06:05:18.363 --> 06:05:18.863
YOU IS THE LEGISLATURE. OR

06:05:18.930 --> 06:05:19.964
THAT. YOU SHOULD MANDATE IN LAW

06:05:20.031 --> 06:05:21.032
CLEAR RESPONSIBILITIES AND

06:05:21.099 --> 06:05:23.668
CLEARER MANDATES TO NOT ONLY

06:05:23.735 --> 06:05:25.069
THE UTILITIES BUT HEALTH PLANS

06:05:25.136 --> 06:05:26.804
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT THEY

06:05:26.871 --> 06:05:28.139
MUST WORK TOGETHER AND THEY

06:05:28.206 --> 06:05:29.040
MUST CORPS NAY BECAUSE RIGHT

06:05:29.107 --> 06:05:30.975
NOW IT A LOT OF THIS IS VERY AT

06:05:31.042 --> 06:05:32.410
HAWK. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT

06:05:32.477 --> 06:05:34.412
COUNTY YOU LIVE IN AND WHETHER

06:05:34.479 --> 06:05:36.514
OR NOT THE SERVICES. THAT ARE

06:05:36.581 --> 06:05:38.349
BEING PROVIDED OR OR OR HIGH

06:05:38.416 --> 06:05:40.652
QUALITY OR NOT IS REALLY AGAIN.

06:05:40.718 --> 06:05:41.452
JUST A QUESTION OF WHERE YOU

06:05:41.519 --> 06:05:43.187
LIVE AND WHAT KIND OF

06:05:43.254 --> 06:05:44.656
LEADERSHIP HAPPENS TO EXIST IN

06:05:44.722 --> 06:05:46.224
THE IN THAT LOCAL AREA. SO A

06:05:46.291 --> 06:05:48.259
LOT OF THIS TO ME IS A QUESTION

06:05:48.326 --> 06:05:50.495
OF MANDATES BY THE STATE. THAT

06:05:50.561 --> 06:05:53.064
REQUIRE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

06:05:53.131 --> 06:05:54.198
CLEAR DIRECTIVES TO EACH OF

06:05:54.265 --> 06:05:56.401
THESE AGENCIES- WHO IS

06:05:56.467 --> 06:05:58.770
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT. WHO WHO

06:05:58.836 --> 06:06:00.204
YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IF AND I

06:06:00.271 --> 06:06:01.806
JUST AS WORKERS NOT GOING TO

06:06:01.873 --> 06:06:03.675
CHECK ON AND I JUST AS CLIENT.

06:06:03.741 --> 06:06:04.809
THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO'S

06:06:04.876 --> 06:06:06.311
GOING TO DO THAT I THINK

06:06:06.377 --> 06:06:07.645
THERE'S A LOT OF FINGER

06:06:07.712 --> 06:06:09.714
POINTING WILL THAT PERSON HAS-

06:06:09.781 --> 06:06:10.882
THAT AGENCY HAS IT AND THAT'S

06:06:10.948 --> 06:06:13.251
JUST SIMPLY NOT HAPPENING.

06:06:13.318 --> 06:06:17.055
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. I DO WANT

06:06:17.121 --> 06:06:17.655
TO POINT OUT I JUST AS WORKERS

06:06:17.722 --> 06:06:18.890
ARE NOT PAID TO GO CHECK ON

06:06:18.956 --> 06:06:20.692
THEIR CLIENTS IN MANY CASES

06:06:20.758 --> 06:06:21.559
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OF

06:06:21.626 --> 06:06:22.760
MONEY TO PUT THE GAS IN THEIR

06:06:22.827 --> 06:06:25.096
CAR. TO GO GET TO THE CLIENT'S

06:06:25.163 --> 06:06:26.831
HOUSE TO CHECK ON THEM. THOSE

06:06:26.898 --> 06:06:28.700
SERVICES ARE NOT PAID BY THE

06:06:28.766 --> 06:06:30.268
STATE. BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

06:06:30.335 --> 06:06:32.470
AUTHORIZED SERVICES SO WHAT I

06:06:32.537 --> 06:06:33.771
WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND TO THE

06:06:33.838 --> 06:06:34.839
LEGISLATURE AND TO THE

06:06:34.906 --> 06:06:36.174
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT YOU.

06:06:36.240 --> 06:06:38.676

INTO PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS. IN

06:06:41.913 --> 06:06:44.349
CASES WHERE THERE ARE THESE PS

06:06:44.415 --> 06:06:45.817
PS IS OR WHERE THERE'S ACTUAL

06:06:45.883 --> 06:06:48.386
DISASTERS. CONSIDER EITHER

06:06:48.453 --> 06:06:52.457
CREATING SOME SORT OF. TIME

06:06:52.523 --> 06:06:53.057
CODE SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN

06:06:53.124 --> 06:06:54.759
SAY THAT YOU KNOW I WAS DOING

06:06:54.826 --> 06:06:56.160
SERVICES ABOVE AND BEYOND THE

06:06:56.227 --> 06:06:57.995
NORMAL COURSE BECAUSE I WAS

06:06:58.062 --> 06:06:58.529
CHECKING ON MY CREDIT WAS

06:06:58.596 --> 06:07:00.164
EVACUATING THEM ALWAYS SAVING

06:07:00.231 --> 06:07:01.366
THEIR LIFE. THINGS THAT THEY'RE

06:07:01.432 --> 06:07:03.000

MORE TIME ON PREPARING FOR THIS

06:07:28.326 --> 06:07:29.193

THE QUALITY OF THAT SERVICE TO

06:11:26.297 --> 06:11:27.832
OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S DUE

06:11:27.898 --> 06:11:28.899
IN PART TO THE RESILIENT

06:11:28.966 --> 06:11:30.701

MENTIONED EARLIER BUT THEY ARE

06:11:52.790 --> 06:11:53.424
UNIQUE I THE SENSE THAT

06:11:53.491 --> 06:11:55.626
THEY'RE HAPPENING BACK TO BACK-

06:11:55.693 --> 06:11:57.461

THAN THAT AND STILL ATTEMPTING

06:12:05.903 --> 06:12:07.872
TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY.

06:12:07.938 --> 06:12:09.106
THEY'RE ALSO UNIQUE IN THAT

06:12:09.173 --> 06:12:10.808
THEY WERE NOT THE TRADITIONAL

06:12:10.875 --> 06:12:12.243
RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE

06:12:12.309 --> 06:12:13.144
THAT WE TRAIN TO IS EMERGENCY

TIME DURING THESE TYPES OF

06:12:21.318 --> 06:12:22.286
INCIDENCES THERE'S NOT THE SAME

06:12:22.353 --> 06:12:23.821
COMMUNICATIONS STRUCTURE.

06:12:23.888 --> 06:12:25.456
THERE'S NOT LARGE TASK FORCES

06:12:25.523 --> 06:12:26.424
ASSEMBLED AT THE STATE

06:12:26.490 --> 06:12:28.092
OPERATIONS CENTER LOOKING AT

06:12:28.159 --> 06:12:29.860
OUR HOSPITAL SURGES BEING

06:12:29.927 --> 06:12:31.629
MANAGED WHEN PEOPLE CALL NINE

06:12:31.696 --> 06:12:32.930
ONE ONE OR WHEN PEOPLE. PEOPLE

06:12:32.997 --> 06:12:35.066
END UP WITH NO OXYGEN AT HOME

06:12:35.132 --> 06:12:36.333
OR THEY HAVE NO WAY TO CHARGE

06:12:36.400 --> 06:12:37.768
THERE WILL TEAR BATTERIES THEY

06:12:37.835 --> 06:12:38.803
COME TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEY

06:12:38.869 --> 06:12:40.604
ASKED THE ET STAFF. TO HELP

06:12:42.440 --> 06:12:43.641
CHARGE THEIR DEVICE OR FILTER

06:12:43.708 --> 06:12:46.477
OXYGEN TANKS. SO THEY COME TO

06:12:46.544 --> 06:12:47.044
US AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

06:12:47.111 --> 06:12:49.480
DIFFERENT. AND THEN YOUR

06:12:49.547 --> 06:12:51.549
TRADITIONAL DISASTER. OUR

06:12:51.615 --> 06:12:52.516
UTILITY COMPANIES HAVE

06:12:52.583 --> 06:12:53.751

06:12:56.654 --> 06:12:58.222
NOTICED THEY'VE MADE SOME

06:12:58.289 --> 06:12:58.989
CHANGES AND SOME DIFFERENCES

06:12:59.056 --> 06:13:00.091
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK

06:13:00.157 --> 06:13:02.460
TO BE DONE ABOUT INTEGRATION OF

06:13:02.526 --> 06:13:03.761

DIRECT IMPACT OUR FOOD BANKS

06:25:50.760 --> 06:25:52.529
AND HERE PRECISE DATA CAN BE

06:25:52.596 --> 06:25:53.129
DIFFICULT TO COME BY BECAUSE

06:25:53.196 --> 06:25:54.764
THEY DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AS A

06:25:54.831 --> 06:25:56.032
EMERGENCY FOOD SERVICE

06:25:56.099 --> 06:25:57.701
PROVIDER. WHICH IS ESPECIALLY

06:25:57.767 --> 06:25:58.201
IMPORTANT FOR IMMIGRANT

06:25:58.268 --> 06:25:59.469
FAMILIES AND OTHERS IN THIS

06:25:59.536 --> 06:26:00.937
KIND OF FEAR. BUT IN TERMS OF

06:26:01.004 --> 06:26:02.305
FOOD LOS DEGREES OCCURRED IN

06:26:02.372 --> 06:26:04.140
HUMBLE COUNTY WHERE THE ENTIRE

06:26:04.207 --> 06:26:05.709
COUNTY WAS DE ENERGIZED SO NOT

06:26:05.775 --> 06:26:06.843
ONLY TO THE FOOD BANK FOOD FOR

06:26:06.910 --> 06:26:08.612
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING A FOOD LOS

06:26:08.678 --> 06:26:10.146

06:26:10.213 --> 06:26:11.815
STORES SO WHERE PEOPLE EXPECTED

06:26:11.882 --> 06:26:12.616

06:26:15.018 --> 06:26:15.585
THOUSAND SQUARE MILE COUNTY YOU

06:26:16.853 --> 06:26:18.722
EXPENSE AGAIN LIKE MISS BEST

06:26:18.788 --> 06:26:19.990
HAMILTON SAID EARLIER SINGULAR

06:26:20.056 --> 06:26:22.058
EVEN OF THE MONEY TO DO THIS-

06:26:22.125 --> 06:26:23.326
JUST REPLACE THOSE WHO SUCKS.

06:26:23.393 --> 06:26:25.028
LITTLE PEOPLE WHO WENT WITHOUT.

06:26:25.095 --> 06:26:27.063
IN CINEMA COUNTY I THINK WE

06:26:27.130 --> 06:26:28.598
JUST HEARD- ABOUT THE SEVERITY

06:26:28.665 --> 06:26:30.133
OF THE IMPACT BUT THE RED

06:26:30.200 --> 06:26:31.468
EMPIRE FOOD BANK WAS IN THE

06:26:31.535 --> 06:26:33.103
MANDATORY EVACUATION ZONE SO

06:26:33.169 --> 06:26:34.137
THE COMBINATION OF T. S. P. S.

06:26:34.204 --> 06:26:35.772
AND KINCAID FIRE. INTO THAT THE

06:26:35.839 --> 06:26:37.574
MOMENT THAT THE STAFF AND THE

06:26:37.641 --> 06:26:38.275
PEOPLE WE NEED TO THE

06:26:38.341 --> 06:26:39.576
INSTITUTION THE MOST THEY COULD

06:26:39.643 --> 06:26:41.411
EVEN ACCESS THE WAREHOUSE RIGHT

06:26:41.478 --> 06:26:42.779
NOW OBVIOUSLY THAT WAS A PUBLIC

06:26:42.846 --> 06:26:44.114
SAFETY SITUATION BUT IS TO GIVE

06:26:44.180 --> 06:26:45.048
YOU A SENSE OF WHAT OUR NETWORK

06:26:45.115 --> 06:26:46.850
IS TRYING TO DO. TO FEED PEOPLE

06:26:46.917 --> 06:26:48.752
OKAY AND PARTICULARLY THEIR

06:26:48.818 --> 06:26:50.186
SISTER INSTITUTIONS SO THERE

06:26:50.253 --> 06:26:52.155
ARE AND WILL USE IN PLACE WITH

06:26:52.222 --> 06:26:53.023
THE NAPA VALLEY FOOD BANK IN

06:26:53.089 --> 06:26:54.991
OTHERS. BUT THEY TOO WERE

06:26:55.058 --> 06:26:56.026
STRUGGLING TO FEED PEOPLE

06:26:56.092 --> 06:26:58.228
EVACUATE THE FIRES AND THEN-

06:26:58.295 --> 06:26:59.996
HAVING THE THERE IF SOMEBODY

06:27:00.063 --> 06:27:02.632
SHUT DOWN- DO THAT TO THE PS PS

06:27:02.699 --> 06:27:04.868
RIGHT SO THOSE MO USE BRINGING

06:27:04.935 --> 06:27:06.336
IN MUTUAL AID SIMPLY CAN'T WORK

06:27:06.403 --> 06:27:07.938
IN A WIDE SPREAD. DISASTER LIKE

06:27:08.004 --> 06:27:10.807
THE PS CASTRATO- AND JUST TO

06:27:10.874 --> 06:27:12.042
GIVE YOU A SENSE FROM SOME OF

06:27:12.108 --> 06:27:13.243
THE THAT WE WERE WE WERE ABLE

06:27:13.310 --> 06:27:14.678
TO GET. THE SHASTA SENIORS AND

06:27:14.744 --> 06:27:16.413
READ ABOUT THE READING THEY SAW

06:27:16.479 --> 06:27:18.281
ALMOST A 23% INCREASE IN THEIR

06:27:18.348 --> 06:27:19.883
SERVICE LEVELS LIKE THAT ARE

06:27:19.950 --> 06:27:21.451
SIMPLY UNSUSTAINABLE FOR FOOD

06:27:21.518 --> 06:27:22.085
BANKS THAT ARE ALREADY

06:27:22.152 --> 06:27:23.019
STRUGGLING TO ANYTHING IN THE

06:27:23.086 --> 06:27:24.354
COMMUNITIES. IN SOUTHERN

06:27:24.421 --> 06:27:33.096
CALIFORNIA THE SHOTS. ARE

06:27:33.163 --> 06:27:33.563
OBVIOUSLY LESS SEVERE.

06:27:33.630 --> 06:27:34.164
APPROVING SET THE SCENE TO GO

06:27:34.230 --> 06:27:43.540
FOOD BANK. AND THERE'S

06:27:43.607 --> 06:27:45.141
TERRITORY WHICH CREATED

06:27:45.208 --> 06:27:46.309
CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT FOOD

06:27:46.376 --> 06:27:47.744
RESOURCES WERE AVAILABLE. AND

06:27:47.811 --> 06:27:49.145
THEY ALSO DID NOT GIVEACT YOUR

06:27:49.212 --> 06:27:50.880
COMMUNICATION TO THE BOW ADDS.

06:27:50.947 --> 06:27:51.881
ABOUT WHAT FOOD IS NEEDED AT

06:27:51.948 --> 06:27:53.216
THE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS.

06:27:53.283 --> 06:27:54.651
SO IT'S GOING TO ADD ABOUT THE

06:27:54.718 --> 06:27:56.853
NEED TO IMPROVE THAT KIND OF

06:27:56.920 --> 06:27:57.487
COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION.

06:27:57.554 --> 06:27:59.656
WITH CAN RESOURCE CENTERS- BUT

06:27:59.723 --> 06:28:01.424
BEYOND THE IMPACT OUR NETWORK

06:28:01.491 --> 06:28:02.158
IS TO THE MILLIONS OF

06:28:02.225 --> 06:28:03.259
CALIFORNIANS THAT WE STRIVE TO

06:28:03.326 --> 06:28:05.662
SERVE- AND THERE ARE TOO MANY

06:28:05.729 --> 06:28:07.664
STORIES TO SHARE BUT- BUT SOME

06:28:07.731 --> 06:28:08.598
JUST VERY QUICKLY. THERE WERE

06:28:08.665 --> 06:28:11.034
SENIOR AND NAPA. A PARAPLEGIC

06:28:11.101 --> 06:28:12.702
OLDER ADULTS STRAPPED TO THEIR

06:28:12.769 --> 06:28:14.304
CHAIR. WHO IS STUCK IN THE

06:28:14.371 --> 06:28:15.872
AUTOMATED CHAIR AND TO LOOK FOR

06:28:15.939 --> 06:28:17.641
MAKING THEIR NETWORK OF

06:28:17.707 --> 06:28:18.208
VOLUNTEERS ARE ABLE TO WORK

06:28:18.274 --> 06:28:18.742
WITH THEIR SON TOOK ABOUT

06:28:18.808 --> 06:28:21.177
BATTERY. TO ACTIVATE THAT CHAIR

06:28:21.244 --> 06:28:22.245
ALRIGHT SO THE FOOD BANKS ARE

06:28:22.312 --> 06:28:23.613
GOING THE EXTRA MILE WHEN

06:28:23.680 --> 06:28:24.714
THEY'RE ABLE BUT OBVIOUSLY WE

06:28:24.781 --> 06:28:25.882
CAN'T WE CAN'T GET TO EVERYONE

06:28:25.949 --> 06:28:26.750
AS WE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS

06:28:26.816 --> 06:28:28.118
PANEL. AT FROM THE SAINTLY WAS

06:28:28.184 --> 06:28:30.754
CHURCH IN CINEMA- WE KNOW THAT

06:28:30.820 --> 06:28:32.255
OLDER ADULTS HAD A THROAT MILK.

06:28:32.322 --> 06:28:33.790
GROCERIES I'M SORRY CITY GREENS

06:28:33.857 --> 06:28:36.259
FISH. AND OTHER PERISHABLES

06:28:36.326 --> 06:28:37.894
THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY NOT ABLE

06:28:37.961 --> 06:28:38.461
TO REPLACE BECAUSE FOR BANKS

06:28:38.528 --> 06:28:39.663
DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF STOCK N

06:28:39.729 --> 06:28:42.399
HAND. SO I WANT TO GIVE- MUCH

06:28:42.465 --> 06:28:43.700
THANKS TO CSS WE HEAR FROM THE

06:28:43.767 --> 06:28:45.402
SECRETARY GOLLY EARLIER. BUT

06:28:45.468 --> 06:28:46.636
THERE IS NO STATE FLEXIBLE FOOD

06:28:46.703 --> 06:28:48.538
RESOURCE AVAILABLE AND FEDERAL

06:28:48.605 --> 06:28:49.539
AID IS LIMITED AS IS. THIS WAS

06:28:49.606 --> 06:28:50.607
NOT A PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED

06:28:50.674 --> 06:28:53.176
DISASTER. WHILE CSS IS AFTER

06:28:53.243 --> 06:28:54.244
THE MAXIMUM LEXIBILITY. FOR A

06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:55.245
PLACE TO BENEFITS OF

06:28:55.311 --> 06:28:56.279
CALIFORNIA. AND I REALLY DO

06:28:56.346 --> 06:28:57.614

06:37:45.841 --> 06:37:48.611
WEATHER. AND ALL OF. OUR WRAP

06:37:48.678 --> 06:37:50.546

DEGRADATION IN OUR COUNTY. AND

06:38:05.194 --> 06:38:06.062
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T

06:38:06.128 --> 06:38:09.298
COMMUNICATE WITH INCIDENT

06:38:09.365 --> 06:38:09.765

06:39:47.229 --> 06:39:48.230
EARLIER COMMENTS ON

06:39:48.297 --> 06:39:50.466
TELECOMMUNICATIONS WE HAD A

06:39:50.533 --> 06:39:52.168
FIRE. WE BROKE OF FIRING THE

06:39:52.234 --> 06:39:54.070
MIDDLE THIS THING HI LILY DROVE

06:39:54.136 --> 06:39:56.005
UP TO THE FIRE THAT NIGHT TWO

06:39:56.072 --> 06:39:57.173
HOURS INTO IT I STARTED THAT

06:39:57.239 --> 06:39:58.774
FIRE COMING DOWN THE HILL.

06:39:58.841 --> 06:40:00.209
KNOWING THAT I COULD NOT WORN

06:40:00.276 --> 06:40:02.445
MY COMMUNITY. THAT MY COMMUNITY

06:40:02.511 --> 06:40:03.245
COULD NOT RECEIVE MY PHONE

06:40:03.312 --> 06:40:05.581
CALLS MY CABLE MESSAGES. I

06:40:05.648 --> 06:40:07.917
COULD NOT REACH THEM. AND SO WE

06:40:07.983 --> 06:40:09.418
USE HIGH LOW SIRENS ENSURE

06:40:09.485 --> 06:40:11.253
SQUAD CARS WE USE NO WEATHER

06:40:11.320 --> 06:40:13.422
RADIO WE USED ALL THESE ALTERED

06:40:13.489 --> 06:40:14.390
SYSTEMS WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPED

06:40:14.457 --> 06:40:16.325
FOR LAST YEAR'S WE KNEW. THAT

06:40:16.392 --> 06:40:20.329
WAS NOT AS JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

06:40:20.396 --> 06:40:20.896
AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE

06:40:20.963 --> 06:40:21.497
POWER BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST

06:40:21.564 --> 06:40:23.599
PLACE. HE WAS LITERALLY

06:40:23.666 --> 06:40:24.166
FIGHTING THIS FIRE WITH ONE

06:40:24.233 --> 06:40:25.701
HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACK. WE

06:40:25.768 --> 06:40:27.069
CANNOT COMMUNICATE WITH OUR

06:40:27.136 --> 06:40:28.003
COMMUNITY WE CANNOT OPEN

06:40:28.070 --> 06:40:30.840
SHELTERS TRAFFIC SIGNALS ROUTE

06:40:30.906 --> 06:40:33.843
WE EVACUATED. HUNDRED AND

06:40:33.909 --> 06:40:35.077
NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHICH

06:40:35.144 --> 06:40:36.545

COMMUNICATIONS ABOUT TRAFFIC

06:40:37.913 --> 06:40:40.049
LIGHTS. IT'S STUNNING TO ME

06:40:40.116 --> 06:40:40.783
THAT WE DIDN'T KILL PEOPLE

06:40:40.850 --> 06:40:42.718
DURING THAT EVENT. SO

06:40:42.785 --> 06:40:44.387
GENERALIZATION RADICALLY

06:40:44.453 --> 06:40:46.789
IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND

06:40:46.856 --> 06:40:47.390
TO THE ACTUAL FIRE VENTURE TO

06:40:47.456 --> 06:40:50.192
OCCUR. AND IT FOR THE AXIS AND

06:40:50.259 --> 06:40:51.761
FUNCTIONAL NEEDS COMMUNITY THIS

06:40:51.827 --> 06:40:52.361
IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR

06:40:52.428 --> 06:40:55.464
US. AS WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY

06:40:55.531 --> 06:40:57.099

LIVE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR

06:40:58.334 --> 06:41:00.136
ISSUES ARE THERE ARE LIMITED

06:41:00.202 --> 06:41:01.437
RESOURCES I CAN BE BROUGHT TO

I HEARD UTILITIES I WHO'S YOUR

06:41:05.307 --> 06:41:06.642
EARLIER TALK ABOUT HARDSHIP AND

06:41:06.709 --> 06:41:08.344
CAN BE IT'S NOT IT'S LIFE OR

06:41:08.411 --> 06:41:09.979
DEATH. AT SOME POINT WE ARE

06:41:10.045 --> 06:41:11.514
GONNA KILL PEOPLE WE HAD A

06:41:11.580 --> 06:41:13.749
BROKEN BACK IN ONE EVENT WE HAD

06:41:13.816 --> 06:41:14.917
ONE MAN BURKE HIMSELF ON A

06:54:45.694 --> 06:54:46.995
EIGHTY OP RETAIL WATER AND

06:54:47.062 --> 06:54:48.597
WASTEWATER AGENCY THAT SERVES

06:54:48.663 --> 06:54:50.131
THE WESTERN PORTION OF LA

06:54:50.198 --> 06:54:52.000
COUNTY. AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO

06:54:52.067 --> 06:54:53.935
IS SHARE WITH YOU- THE

06:54:54.002 --> 06:54:55.036
PERSPECTIVE A WATER AND WASTE

06:54:55.103 --> 06:54:57.505
WATER AGENCIES ON PS PS EVENTS

06:54:57.572 --> 06:54:59.274
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ITEM

06:54:59.341 --> 06:55:01.476
FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER-

06:55:01.543 --> 06:55:03.044
AND I'LL BE SHARING MY OWN

06:55:03.111 --> 06:55:04.646
EXPERIENCES FROM MY AGENCY BUT

06:55:04.713 --> 06:55:06.514
ALSO FROM- FEEDBACK I RECEIVE

06:55:06.581 --> 06:55:08.850
STATEWIDE. THROUGH THE

06:55:08.917 --> 06:55:09.484
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER

06:55:09.551 --> 06:55:11.753
AGENCIES. SPECIFICALLY HAVE

06:55:11.820 --> 06:55:12.954
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THREE

06:55:13.021 --> 06:55:14.122
DIFFERENT AREAS ONE WITH REGARD

06:55:14.189 --> 06:55:15.757
TO COMMUNICATIONS. TO

06:55:15.824 --> 06:55:17.892
OPERATIONAL IMPACTS AND THEN

06:55:17.959 --> 06:55:19.494
THREE FINANCIAL IMPACTS AND I

06:55:19.561 --> 06:55:21.463
DID SUBMIT ALSO WRITTEN

06:55:21.529 --> 06:55:22.631
TESTIMONY THAT I WOULD ASK BE

06:55:22.697 --> 06:55:24.833
ACCEPTED FOR THE RECORD. OUR IS

06:55:24.899 --> 06:55:28.203
IT WORTH DID YOU SUBMITTED.

06:55:28.270 --> 06:55:29.504
OKAY WE HAVE A OPTIONS I THINK

06:55:29.571 --> 06:55:30.272
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT-

06:55:30.338 --> 06:55:32.540
AND THAT OUR WATER AND

06:55:32.607 --> 06:55:33.675
WASTEWATER AGENCIES WE NEED

06:55:33.742 --> 06:55:35.677
ELECTRICITY TO DO OUR JOB WE

06:55:35.744 --> 06:55:37.545
CANNOT PUMP AND TREAT THE WATER

06:55:37.612 --> 06:55:39.681
THAT PEOPLE NEED AS AS A AN

06:55:39.748 --> 06:55:40.882
ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICE

06:55:40.949 --> 06:55:42.684
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY. AND WHAT

06:55:42.751 --> 06:55:43.985
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERY

06:55:44.052 --> 06:55:46.154
BASIC HUMAN NEEDS HERE DRINKING

06:55:46.221 --> 06:55:48.757
COOKING CLEANING BATHING.

06:55:48.823 --> 06:55:50.425
SANITATION AND IMPORTANTLY FIRE

06:55:50.492 --> 06:55:52.427
PROTECTION AS WELL OUR WATER

06:55:52.494 --> 06:55:53.461
SYSTEMS PROVIDE A FIRE

06:55:53.528 --> 06:55:56.197
PROTECTION SYSTEM. AND SO OUR

06:55:56.264 --> 06:55:57.832
GOAL WHEN WE LOOK AT PS PS

06:55:57.899 --> 06:55:59.768
EVENTS AS WATER UTILITIES IS

06:55:59.834 --> 06:56:00.835
THAT WE CANNOT HAVE AN

06:56:00.902 --> 06:56:03.204
INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE WE NEED

06:56:03.271 --> 06:56:04.039
TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS SERVICE

06:56:04.105 --> 06:56:06.041
REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS.

06:56:06.107 --> 06:56:07.108
AND SO WE HAVE A GREAT

06:56:07.175 --> 06:56:09.177
CHALLENGE IN DOING THAT- IN

06:56:09.244 --> 06:56:10.945
TERMS OF COMMUNICATION ARE HIGH

06:56:11.012 --> 06:56:12.414
ENERGY PROVIDER IS SOUTHERN

06:56:12.480 --> 06:56:15.650
CALIFORNIA EDISON. WE RECEIVE

06:56:15.717 --> 06:56:16.885
SIXTY SIX NOTIFICATIONS OF PS

06:56:16.951 --> 06:56:18.486
PS EVENTS TEN OF THEM RESULTED

06:56:18.553 --> 06:56:20.255
IN SHUT OFFS AND I WILL SAY

06:56:20.322 --> 06:56:21.890
THAT WITH EDISON WE HAVE HAD A

06:56:21.956 --> 06:56:23.892
POSITIVE. EXPERIENCE IN THAT

06:56:23.958 --> 06:56:25.360
THE DATA WAS BOTH TIMELY AND

06:56:25.427 --> 06:56:27.262
ACCURATE BUT IT TALKING TO MY

06:56:27.329 --> 06:56:28.897
COLLEAGUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE

06:56:28.963 --> 06:56:29.564
THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE AS

06:56:29.631 --> 06:56:31.533
YOU'VE HEARD. TODAY THOUGHT

06:56:31.599 --> 06:56:32.667
GENERALLY SOME OF THE CONCERNS

06:56:32.734 --> 06:56:35.170
THAT WE'VE HEARD IS THE LACK OF

06:56:35.236 --> 06:56:36.204
ADEQUATE ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE

06:56:36.271 --> 06:56:38.606
SHOT OFFICE. THE ACCURACY OF

06:56:38.673 --> 06:56:40.642
THE DATA AND THE GRANULARITY OF

06:56:40.709 --> 06:56:42.277
THAT DATA AND THEN LAST

06:56:42.344 --> 06:56:45.213
INFORMATION LACKING ON THE TIME

06:56:45.280 --> 06:56:46.648
LINE FOR RESTORATION OF

06:56:46.715 --> 06:56:49.384
SERVICE- SO IN TERMS OF THE

06:56:49.451 --> 06:56:50.485
FIRST RECOMMENDATION

06:56:50.552 --> 06:56:51.753
COMMUNICATIONS IS THAT THERE'S

06:56:51.820 --> 06:56:53.788
NEED AND VALUE. IN HAVING

06:56:53.855 --> 06:56:57.258
ENHANCED AND STANDARDIZE

06:56:57.325 --> 06:56:57.859
COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS FOR PS

06:56:57.926 --> 06:57:02.564
PS EVENTS. WITH REGARD TO

06:57:02.630 --> 06:57:03.331
OPERATIONS FOR OUR UTILITIES

06:57:03.398 --> 06:57:04.032
THERE'S MAJOR OPERATIONAL

06:57:04.099 --> 06:57:04.599
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WHEN

06:57:04.666 --> 06:57:05.834
THE POWER GOES OFF WE HAVE TO

06:57:05.900 --> 06:57:06.935
COMPLETELY OPERATE OUR WATER

06:57:07.001 --> 06:57:08.636
SYSTEMS DIFFERENTLY. OUR WATER

06:57:08.703 --> 06:57:10.171
SYSTEMS ARE VERY AUTOMATED WE

06:57:10.238 --> 06:57:12.207
HAVE TO BRING IN EMPLOYEES WHO

06:57:12.273 --> 06:57:13.041
ARE NOT NORMALLY AT WORK WE

06:57:13.108 --> 06:57:14.409
HAVE TO PUT PUMPS IN MANUAL

06:57:14.476 --> 06:57:15.710
MODE WHEN WE GET A

06:57:15.777 --> 06:57:17.512
NOTIFICATION. WE ACTUALLY

06:57:17.579 --> 06:57:18.780
CALLING ALL OF OUR PUMPS TO

06:57:18.847 --> 06:57:20.482
GOING FILL OUR WATER TANKS AND

06:57:20.548 --> 06:57:21.649
THEN WE HOLD OUR TANKS AT THE

06:57:21.716 --> 06:57:23.952
HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE WE DON'T

06:57:24.018 --> 06:57:24.586
ALLOW THEM TO CYCLE THROUGH THE

06:57:24.652 --> 06:57:26.654
NORMAL RANGE LIKE THEY DO- AND

06:57:26.721 --> 06:57:29.190
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO OPERATE. ON

06:57:29.257 --> 06:57:31.593
ALL OF THAT. REQUIRES USING

06:57:31.659 --> 06:57:33.027
POWER AT TIMES WHEN WE WOULD

06:57:33.094 --> 06:57:34.963
WOULD NOT NORMALLY. FREQUENTLY%

06:57:35.029 --> 06:57:36.064
DURING PEAK PERIODS AND ONE

06:57:36.131 --> 06:57:37.966
POWERS MOST EXPENSIVE. AND THEN

06:57:38.032 --> 06:57:39.467
WHAT POWER ACTUALLY GOES OFF

06:57:39.534 --> 06:57:40.201
THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF

06:57:40.268 --> 06:57:41.569
ACTIONS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE WE

06:57:41.636 --> 06:57:42.837
NEED TO DEPLOY EMERGENCY

06:57:42.904 --> 06:57:45.273
GENERATORS. AND THEN WE NEED TO

06:57:45.340 --> 06:57:47.809
CONTINUOUSLY GO OUT AND- CHECK

06:57:47.876 --> 06:57:49.210
ON THOSE EMERGENCY GENERATORS

06:57:49.277 --> 06:57:50.812
REFUEL THEM AND WE NEED TO HAVE

06:57:50.879 --> 06:57:52.247
MECHANICS ELECTRICIANS ON HAND

06:57:52.313 --> 06:57:55.183
ALL TIME AT ALL TIMES. TO

06:57:55.250 --> 06:57:59.421
SERVICE THOSE GENERATORS. TOM

06:57:59.487 --> 06:58:00.021
WE HAVE AGENCIES AS WELL WHO

06:58:00.088 --> 06:58:00.655
HAVE HAD TO RENT GENERATORS AND

06:58:00.722 --> 06:58:01.256
RENTING GENERATORS HAS BEEN

06:58:01.322 --> 06:58:03.057
DIFFICULT. IN SOME CASES

06:58:03.124 --> 06:58:04.559
GENERATORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE

06:58:04.626 --> 06:58:06.594
FOR RENT. ALL OF THESE

06:58:06.661 --> 06:58:08.229
GENERATORS FOR THE TYPE AND THE

06:58:08.296 --> 06:58:10.398
SIZE OF. OUR FACILITIES THAT WE

06:58:10.465 --> 06:58:12.567
NEED MOVING- WATER REQUIRES A

06:58:12.634 --> 06:58:14.602
LOT OF POWER. THESE ARE LARGE-

06:58:14.669 --> 06:58:15.870
PIECES OF EQUIPMENT AND RUN ON

06:58:15.937 --> 06:58:17.906
DIESEL POWER. ONE OF THE

06:58:17.972 --> 06:58:19.474
CHALLENGES THAT WE RUN INTO IS

06:58:19.541 --> 06:58:20.575
THAT- THERE ARE STRICT AIR

06:58:20.642 --> 06:58:22.210
QUALITY REGULATIONS THAT APPLY

06:58:22.277 --> 06:58:23.711
TO THESE DIESEL ENGINES. AND

06:58:23.778 --> 06:58:25.814
THAT HAS BEEN A BARRIER FOR US

06:58:25.880 --> 06:58:28.149
IN RUNNING OUR ENGINES UNDER

06:58:28.216 --> 06:58:29.317
SOME CIRCUMSTANCES SOURCE

06:58:29.384 --> 06:58:31.152
SECOND RECOMMENDATION. IS THAT

06:58:31.219 --> 06:58:32.821
SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY

06:58:32.887 --> 06:58:34.222
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL WITH

06:58:34.289 --> 06:58:35.490
REGARD TO THE NUMERIC RUN

06:58:35.557 --> 06:58:37.292
TIMES. THAT ARE CONTAINED IN

06:58:37.358 --> 06:58:38.693
BOTH STATE AND LOCAL AIR

06:58:38.760 --> 06:58:40.061
QUALITY REGULATIONS. FOR

06:58:40.128 --> 06:58:42.497
GENERATORS AND THEN LAST IN THE

06:58:42.564 --> 06:58:45.066
AREA FINANCIAL IMPACT. THERE'S

06:58:45.133 --> 06:58:46.468
A BIG FINANCIAL IMPACT IN TERMS

06:58:46.534 --> 06:58:48.803
OF ADDED LABOR OVERTIME

06:58:48.870 --> 06:58:50.438
EQUIPMENT RENTALS I MENTION

06:58:50.505 --> 06:58:52.006
PEAK PERIOD POWER. AND THEN

06:58:52.073 --> 06:58:54.442
FUEL- AND THEN ON THE CAPITAL

06:58:54.509 --> 06:58:56.211
SIDE THERE'S A BIG IMPACT IN

06:58:56.277 --> 06:58:58.680
TERMS OF. PURCHASING ADDITIONAL

06:58:58.746 --> 06:59:00.348
PORTABLE GENERATORS AND ALSO

06:59:00.415 --> 06:59:02.083
FIXED ON A STATIONARY EMERGENCY

06:59:02.150 --> 06:59:04.452
GENERATORS. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE

06:59:04.519 --> 06:59:06.020
THE EASTERN MUNICIPAL WATER

06:59:06.087 --> 06:59:07.322
DISTRICT THAT SERVES A LARGE

06:59:07.388 --> 06:59:09.591
PORTION OF WESTERN. I RIVERSIDE

06:59:09.657 --> 06:59:11.059
COUNTY THEY ESTIMATED FOR THEIR

06:59:11.125 --> 06:59:13.228
AGENCY ALONE. THAT WOULD COST

06:59:13.294 --> 06:59:14.162
SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION

06:59:14.229 --> 06:59:15.430
DOLLARS FOR THEM TO GET

06:59:15.497 --> 06:59:17.699
GENERATORS THAT THEY NEED. ONLY

06:59:17.765 --> 06:59:18.433
FOR THEIR COMMUNITY SO IF YOU

06:59:18.500 --> 06:59:19.501
WERE TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT

06:59:19.567 --> 06:59:23.538
STATEWIDE TO QUICKLY SEE THAT

06:59:23.605 --> 06:59:24.172
THERE'S HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

06:59:24.239 --> 06:59:28.543
DOLLARS IN NEED. BOB THE

SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

06:59:29.711 --> 06:59:30.245
IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IS VERY

06:59:30.311 --> 06:59:30.812
HELPFUL THE PROBLEM IS THAT

06:59:30.879 --> 06:59:32.013
MONEY IS ON AVAILABLE TO
