THIS EVENING IS MISS LISA CLIMB UP EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL CENTER EAST BAY THE REGIONAL SERIES BIG COORDINATE SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FAMILY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS IN THE ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTIES MS FIVE OF THIRTY FIVE AN AMBER THE SLIDE SIR GONNA BE PROJECTED YEAH OKAY WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND TELL YOU BOTH ABOUT THE REGIONAL CENTER SERVICE SYSTEM AS WELL AS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ALL FACE AT THIS TIME THAT REALLY DO AFFECT THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST THAT THE SITES WILL COME SHORT ON THE REGIONAL CENTER OF THESE SPACERS ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE ARE ONE OF TWENTY ONE REGIONAL CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA WE WERE THE LAST REGIONAL CENTER CREATED IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE NEXT PICTURE I REALLY WANT TO SHOW YOU BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES YES THAT'S FINE WELL THE THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE ADVOCACY OF PARENTS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHO FELT LIKE THERE WERE NO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY REALLY FOUGHT AND WENT UP TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WEEK AFTER WEEK AND THEY WORKED WITH FRANKIE LANDER MEN WHO PASSED LANDER MEN ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR REAGAN AT THAT TIME AND THE LETTERMAN ACT REALLY ESTABLISHES THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND BY THE NINETEEN SURFS THE SEVENTIES THE -- OTHER ADDITIONS TO THE LANDER MEN ACT REALLY ESTABLISH THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASE OR LET ME JUST SHARE WITH THE AUDIENCE THAT YOU HAVE OF WHAT SHE'S GOING TO BE PRESENTING UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T GET IT ON THE SCREEN BUT YOU DO HAVE IT IN THIS FOR CASH TAKE IT SO RESPONSIBILITY TO PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES REGIONAL CENTERS ARE LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE EACH REGIONAL CENTER DOES HAVE ITS OWN CONTRACT WITH THE STATE BUT IT'S THE SAME BOILERPLATE CONTRACT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS FIFTY PERCENT PRIMARY CONSUMERS OR -- FAMILY MEMBERS OF CONSUMERS AND IT'S REQUIRED TO REPRESENT THE ETHNIC GEOGRAPHIC AND DIVERSITY OF OUR REGION AND HAVE BOTH LEGAL MEDICAL AND FINANCIAL EXPERTISE ON THE BOARD WE ARE SUBJECT TO ANNUAL FISCAL AUDITS AUDITS FROM DDS AUDITS ABOUT THE FROM WAIVERS WE HAVE AND WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A PERFORMANCE CONTRACT WHICH SAYS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO DURING THE YEAR AND TERMS OF SERVICE DELIVERY OUR PRIMARY SERVICE IN MY OPINION IS CASE MANAGEMENT WE PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS SERVICES AND LEAD SATISFYING LIFE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO MAKE PAYMENTS TO SERVICE PROVIDERS WEEK MANAGE PEOPLE'S MONEY THROUGH QUIEN TRUST WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAKING PARTNERSHIPS AND DOING OUT REACH TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY ON THE OVERALL ETHNICITY OF THE REGIONAL CENTER OF THE EAST BAY REALLY REFLECTS OUR COMMUNITY AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT OUR POPULATION OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF THREE AND SEE WHERE WE'RE GOING THAT POPULATION IS ON RIGHT NOW IS THIRTY THREE PERCENT LATINO TWENTY THREE PERCENT ASIAN SEVENTEEN PERCENT WHITE SO WE ARE REALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DEVELOP SERVICES TO REFLECT WHAT THOSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS ARE -- OUR FUNDING COMES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES BUT IS A COMPLEX MIX OF BOTH STATE GENERAL FUND AND FEDERAL DAHLE OURS THE COME FROM A NUMBER OF WAIVERS AND OUR REGIONAL CENTER SERVICES THAT OUR CASE MANAGERS HELP PEOPLE TO ACCESS CONSIST OF BOTH SERVICES THAT WE PURCHASE AS WELL AS WHAT ARE CONSIDERED GENERIC SERVICES WHICH ARE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL POPULATION LIKE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES LIKE MEDICAL INSURANCE AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS WE HAVE AN EARLY START PROGRAM WHICH SERVES CHILDREN FROM ZERO TO THREE AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE -- HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE ARE DIAGNOSED WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY AND WE ARE MANDATED TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR THOSE CHILDREN SEARCHES THERAPY -- INFANT DEVELOPMENT SERVICES EQUIPMENT ALL OF THOSE KIND OF THINGS WERE MOSTLY IN THAT REALM AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICE AFTER THE AGE OF THREE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY DO CHANGE AND THAT'S A HARD TRANSITION POINT FOR MANY FAMILIES MANY WHO WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE OVER THE AGE OF THREE FOR OUR SERVICES BUT AFTER THE AGE OF THREE THE REQUIREMENTS ARE AN INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY CEREBRAL PALSY AUTISM EPILEPSY OR CONDITION REAL CLOSELY RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AS WELL AS HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL DISABILITY THE DIAGNOSIS OF A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY OCCURS BEFORE THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND THEN I'VE PROVIDED IN THE BACK EXAMPLES OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE FROM AGE THREE TO TWENTY TWO FOR CHILDREN IN THAT AGE GROUP ARE PRIMARY SERVICES THAT PEOPLE ACCESS OUR RESPITE SPECIALIZED DAYCARE ASSISTANCE TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE WITH COPAYS FOR DIFFERENT INSURANCE PROVIDER SERVICES VERY FEW LIVING OPTIONS SERVICES AND INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES FOR THOSE OVER THE AGE AGE OF EIGHTEEN WE ALSO PROVIDE FOR ADULTS MOBILITY SERVICES INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES RESPITE THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL THE HALLMARK OF HOW WE DEVELOP SERVICES IS THROUGH PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND WE ARE REALLY LAUNCHED IN THIS COMMUNITY ON REALLY TRAINING AND OUTREACH -- WITH OUR CASE MANAGERS AND OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE ALL REALLY ENGAGED IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE THE CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PERSON CENTERED PLANNING AND DOING THAT BETTER WHERE WE LISTEN TO WHAT FAMILIES NEED THE OTHER COMPLEXITY THAT HAS HAPPENED FOR US OVER THE YEARS IS ACCESSING GENERIC RESOURCES WHICH ARE A MAJOR PART OF WHAT WE WE WORK ON WITH FAMILIES HAS GOTTEN MORE COMPLEX FAMILIES HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME ACCESSING THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY WE TRACE CHALLENGES WITH ACTUALLY GETTING IN THE DOOR OF SYSTEMS WHICH FACED DISCRIMINATION WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH YOU DON'T MOSTLY AMONG PRIMARILY WON'T SERVE OUR POPULATION OF OUR EAST BAY COMMUNITY IS A VERY STRONG COMMUNITY OUR STRENGTHS ARE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES COUNCIL IN BOTH COUNTIES WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED DURING THE KENNEDY ERA -- WE HAVE AN EMPLOYMENT FIRST FOCUS COMMUNITY WE HAVE REPLICATED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY A MODEL FOR DELIVERING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WE HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT FINDS COMMON GROUND TO STRENGTHEN OUR ADVOCACY AND DIVERSITY IS REALLY A STRENGTH IN OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING NEW RESOURCES ON OUR LOCAL CHALLENGES SIMILAR TO WHAT I HEARD AND FRESNO TRANSPORTATION HOUSING WERE HIGH COST AREA FOR WORKERS WE HAVE LOCAL MINIMUM WAGES THAT ARE NOT MET BY THIS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE NEED BI LINGUAL THERAPIST AND OTHER STAFF WHO ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUFFERING SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ON MEDIAN RATES WERE IMPOSED ON REGIONAL CENTERS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD PAY PROVIDERS -- PROVIDERS HAD TO MEET A UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE -- WERE IT TAPPED THE BILLING WAS IMPOSED ON PROVIDERS TO BILL CHILDREN WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY START WERE LIMITED -- WE LOST FLEXIBILITY ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM FEES WERE IMPOSED ON THERE WAS INCREASE RELIANCE ON INSURANCE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE ELIMINATION OF SOCIAL RECREATION CAMPING WAS A REALLY BIG DEAL OF THE FAST -- AND OUR CHALLENGES AS A REGIONAL CENTER OR WE HAVE A FUNDING FORMULA FOR REGIONAL CENTERS THAT IS ANTIQUATED DATES BACK TO THE EIGHT NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND EARLY NINETIES WE STATE WIDE NEED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MORE CASE WORKERS TO MEET OUR CASELOAD RAY FEELS WE -- HAVE THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW SERVICES BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT HAVE FUNDING FOR START UP FOR THE COMMUNITY SO OUR PROVIDERS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY'RE UNABLE TO RETAIN STAFF AND UNABLE TO EXPAND THE GROWTH THERE IS GROWTH IN POPULATION BUT NOT AVAILABLE SERVICES THERE'S A HIGH TURNOVER OF DIRECT SERVICE STAFF AND THAT MEANS LESS TRAINING AND PUTS VULNERABLE PEOPLE AT RISK WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF TALK TURN OVER AND WE CAN'T MEET THE PROMISES IN THE I PP AND I'LL TELL YOU QUICKLY WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN WE NEED TO END MEDIAN RATES WE NEED TO ALLOW REGIONAL CENTERS FLEXIBILITY TO MEET LOCAL NEEDS WE NEED TO INCREASE PROVIDER RATE TO REFLECT THE AREA COSTS AND ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENT NGUYEN MINIMUM WAGES COME IN AS IN THE MUNICIPALITY WE NEED TO RESTORE SOCIAL RECREATION AND CAMPING WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE ANNUAL FAMILY PROGRAM FEE THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE A HALF DAY BILLING AND WE NEED TO UPDATE REGIONAL CENTER FUNDING FORMULAS TO REFLECT TWENTY EIGHTEEN REALITIES AND LASTLY I'LL SAY IN OUR COMMUNITY WE LOOK A COLLABORATION SO WE NEED TO KEEP THE DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED BY CLOSING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN OUR SYSTEM WE NEED TO SUPPORT INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS HOUSING NEEDS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED TO RESTORE FUNDING FOR NEWS START A PROGRAM OF NEW PROGRAMS AND WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN EVERY COUNTY SERVE PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO ARE ACTUALLY AT HIGHER RISK OF HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THANK YOU REASON THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS FROM -- MY COLLEAGUES LOWER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE EXACT QUICKER I I DO I DO IF IF I IF I MY DAD JUST VERY IT AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE YOU OUTLINED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS WHICH IS GREAT -- MIGHT YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THAT WELL I THINK THAT THE RATE STUDY THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW FOR OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS WE NEED TO FULLY FUND AND MAYBE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE RATE STUDY MAYBE WILL THINK WE NEED MORE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY HIGH COST COMMUNITIES I ALSO THINK THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO FUND SERVICE COORDINATORS AT A REALISTIC WAY TO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE FUNDED AT THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SERVICE COORDINATOR WE CANNOT HIRE SOMEONE TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED MISSED FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK IS PROBABLY JUST MORE OF A COMMA BUT IN YOUR FIRST DOWN BULLET ITEM HERE ON YOUR CLEVER SOLUTIONS YOU TO KEEP IN THE DOLLARS FROM CLOSED A CENTERS I'VE HEARD THAT A COUPLE TIMES JUST TONIGHT AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S AWESOME THAT IS HERE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- I COULD GET PRETTY EXCITED ABOUT FIGHT FOR BECAUSE THOSE NUMBERS THOSE DOLLARS ARE ALREADY THERE WE'VE GOT TO KEEP THEM HERE SO I THINK THAT THAT'S AS FAR AS LOW HANGING FRUIT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE WORKED OUT GREAT RESTORATION YES ARE THERE AREAS THAT YOU'VE NOTICED WHERE OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OR PROVIDERS WERE THERE SEEMS TO BE RE DONE AND SEE WHERE WE IF WE WERE TO CONSOLIDATE OR BRING SOME SCHOOLS SOURCES TOGETHER -- WE COULD GET INSTEAD OF A SPRAY WE GET A LASER AND BECOME A BIT MORE PRODUCTIVE HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED IN THE THOSE ARE IS IN YOUR FIELD WELL WHAT OUT WHAT I'LL SAY IS THAT I DO THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE CENTERS TO HELP WITH ON HEALTH CARE NEEDS WHERE THE SERVICES ARE CONCENTRATED IN ONE PLACE WITH PEOPLE WITH SPECIALTY KNOWLEDGE -- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO GO TO THEIR LOCAL HEALTH CLINIC AND BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES WHERE EVERYONE ELSE DOES SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR MORE TRAINING MORE EXPERTISE OIL ALL OVER THE STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE RUN ACROSS IN KIND OF THE TRAVELS AND TALKING TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS THE POPULATION IS SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE HEALTH PLANS IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS WORD YOU'RE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO THE HEALTH PLANS JUST SEEMS LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT YOU TELL THEM THAT IN IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO GO TO THEIR HEALTH PLAN BUT THEN IT'S JUST A KIND OF A -- HAND OFTEN NO REAL ADVOCACY AT THAT AFTER THAT POINT CAN WE LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE UP FACILITATED AND I KNOW IT'S SOME IT'S ABOUT IT MANPOWER AND ONE BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IF WE HAVE A SINGLE PARENT WHO'S TRYING TO STAY OF OF FLOAT WITH THEIR EMPLOYMENT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE ALL OF THE BUREAUCRACY THAT HEALTH PLANS HAVE ALSO AND SO I'M LOOKING TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ALSO BECAUSE RIGHT SERIOUSLY I AGREE I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY LAYERS OF GENERIC RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ACCESS IT'S AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX SITUATION AS IS PRIVATE INSURANCE SO I'D LOVE TO WORK ON THE ISSUE WE DEVELOPED A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH CONTRA COSTA HEALTH PLAN AS WE TRANSITION PEOPLE FROM AB A FUNDED BY REGIONAL CENTERS TO AB A FUNDED THROUGH THE HEALTH PLANS BUT THAT WAS THE ONE HEALTH PLAN THE REALLY DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB NOT OLD DID AS WELL AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN SO I I WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THE ISSUE BUT IT WILL TAKE CASE MANAGEMENT RATIOS ARE OTHER WAYS OF SERVING PEOPLE AND GETTING ACCESS AND UNDERSTANDING THAT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW RETENTION OF EMPLOYMENT FOR YOUR THROUGH YOUR FOLKS AND AND HAVING AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF CASE MANAGERS YES MOVING FORWARD OF WHEN YOU HAVE OF YOUR PROVIDERS IS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S A WAITING LIST BECAUSE OF OF HAS PROVIDED THE RESOURCES HALF THE BUILDING THE THE FURLOUGHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WE'RE LOSING PROVIDERS AND NOW THE CLIENTS ARE COSTS CONSUMERS ARE BEING MADE TO WAIT YES ACTION ACTUALLY WHY A MET WITH A SERVICE PROVIDER YESTERDAY WHO TOLD ME THAT EVERY TIME HE HAS A CONSUMER LEAVE HIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY MOVE FOR OTHER THINGS HAPPEN HE CANNOT FILL THAT SLOT BECAUSE HE STILL DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE THIS BECAUSE OF THE RATES AND BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY IN THIS AREA HE JUST CAN'T TAKE ON IN THE PEOPLE EVEN TO BACK FILL SOME SLUTTY USED TO HAVE A PROGRAM GERMANY NUMBERS ON HOW MANY CONSUMERS YOU HAVE WAITING FOR SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT'S A HARD THING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK SOME PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT WE DID HAVE SOME DAY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO LOOKED AT HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY HAD ON THEIR WAITING LIST BUT IT'S A LITTLE OFF BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN BE ON MULTIPLE WAITING LESSON OF THE OTHER THING IS IT WOULD WOULD HELP VALIDATE YEAH THE RATE STUDY IN AND THE NEED TO ENABLE TO SUPPORT IT YEAH YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH ONE TWO OR ABA PROVIDER IN THE AREA WHICH IS KRISTIN BREA ISSUES -- WITH THE CENTER OF SOCIAL DYNAMICS CHRISTIAN PLEASE SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK SO HI MY NAME IS KRISTEN BREA I'VE BEEN IN THE FIELD OF DISABILITIES FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS TWENTY NINE YEARS -- TWENTY FIVE THAT WAS AS A CLINICIAN WORKING DIRECTLY WITH FAMILIES AND CLIENTS GOINGS THE HOMES IN THE COMMUNITY INTO SCHOOL SETTINGS WHEN IT OFF WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE NOW I'M IN THE -- DUBIOUS HONOR OF BEING IN THE AT THE ADMIN SIDE OF IT SOME REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR A COMPANY THAT PROVIDES ABA SERVICES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND OREGON AND WASHINGTON COMPANIES CALLED CENTER FOR SOCIAL SOCIAL DYNAMICS I RUN OFFICES IN ROHNERT PARK VALLEJO AND -- SACRAMENTO -- BUT WE DO ALSO HAVE AN OFFICE HERE IN ALAMEDA WE'RE OPENING ONE CERTAIN MARTINEZ WERE DEFINITELY COVER IN THIS AREA AS WELL SO DOES YOU KNOW HOW FOR A BA SERVICES I'LL GIVE YOU A LITTLE -- JUST A QUICK ABA ABA IS APPLIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS IT'S SCIENCE BASED THERAPY WORKING ON BEHAVES OF CHILDREN OUR CLIENTS ANY AGE SO WE GO INTO THE HOMES WE TALK TO THE PARENTS WE FIND OUT THEIR CONCERNS WE REALLY GET A SENSE OF WHAT WOULD IMPROVE THEIR LIVES THE QUALITY OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR CHILD'S LIVES WE DO YOU USE ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND WE COME UP WITH A VERY INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAM FOR THAT CLIENT SO WHAT WE'RE FACING NOW THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND IT'S FAIRLY RECENT WITH THE INSURANCE PAYERS IS THERE TRYING TO AGE OUT OUR CLIENTS HAD A MUCH YOUNGER AGE WE'RE GETTING AUTHORIZED FOR LESS HOURS AND WERE HAVING TO FIGHT HARDER FOR THOSE HOURS SO TYPICALLY WE WOULD GET ANYWHERE FROM THIRTEEN AND A HALF TO FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN HOURS A MONTH IS A SUPER IS LEVEL NOW ALL THE REPORTS THAT WERE SUBMITTING THEIR OWN AND ONLY APPROVING SIX SO IT'S REALLY LIMITING WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THOSE CLIENTS AND FOR THE AGING OUT PROCESS YOU KNOW IT'S JUST WE DISAGREE WITH THAT STRONGLY AND ARE REALLY HAVING TO PUSH BACK IN ORDER TO CONTINUE SERVICES IT'S VERY DATABASE THE A BA AND SO WE HAVE WE HAVE THE RATIONALE THE CLINICAL RATIONALE AND WE HAVE THE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE QUALITY THE LIVES OF THE CLIENTS AND FOR THE FAMILIES WHICH IS WHY WE'RE IN THIS AND FOR THEM TO BE PUSHING BACK AND LIMITING THOSE ANY CHILD OVER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN THEY NOW WANT TO TRANSITION PLAN SOME OF THESE CLIENTS WE DON'T GET INTO THEIR FOURTEEN AND SO THERE'S NO WAY THAT WE CAN GIVE A TRANSITION PLAN SO THAT'S OUR BIGGEST STRUGGLE RIGHT NOW THE OTHER THING IS IS -- COPAYS OF THE BIG ONE SO WE HAVE FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE OUR SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE COPAYS ATTACHED TO THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT WE MIGHT HAVE A CLIENT THAT RECEIVE SERVICES FIVE DAYS A WEEK THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE FAMILY PAY THE CO PAY FOR EVERY TIME WE'RE IN THE HOME CASE THAT'S A STRUGGLE AND SCHISM FAMILIES REFUSE SERVICES BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE THAT THAT BREAKS OUR HEARTS THE OWNER OF THE COMPANY THAT I WORK FOR HAS CREATED A FOUNDATION AND WE'RE AS WE FUNDRAISE FOR THAT FOUNDATION WHICH IS SEPARATE FROM THE ACTUAL COMPANY YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE USED FORCE TO HELP FAMILIES A CO PAYS OKAY WE WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS OR TRYING TO CREATE OUR OWN -- ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT WE WORRY ABOUT WITH OUR CLIENTS IS AS THE -- AS THEIR A TRYING TO AGE OUT OUR CLIENTS AT A VERY EARLY AGE WE HAD A MEETING RECENTLY AND ONE OF THE PAIRS REPRESENTED THE PAIR SAID TO US EVERY CLIENT OVER THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN SHOULD BE SERVICED BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS BUT IT'S SUCH A FAR CRY FROM THE REALITY THAT WE FACE EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE SEE PARENTS WHO ARE DENIED SERVICES FROM REGIONAL CENTERS I SEE INCONSISTENCIES FROM ONE REGIONAL CENTER TO ANOTHER AND WE WORK WITH SO MANY AND IN THE REGION I COVER A LOAN AND SOME ARE GREAT AND AND THE CLIENTS ARE ARE GETTING THOSE CO PAY ASSISTANCE AND THEY'RE GETTING RESPITE SERVICES AND OTHER ONES ARE DENIED -- SUMMER DENIED BECAUSE THEY DENY THEIR DIAGNOSIS WHEN THE DIAGNOSIS ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY DOWN WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT SOMETIMES A CLAIM IS DENIED BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSIDERED NOT IMPACTED ENOUGH WHEN WE KNOW BECAUSE WE WORK WITH THAT PLAN THAT WE CAN'T EVEN TAKE THAT CLIENT INTO THE COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING A HARNESS PHYSICALLY BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A DANGER OKAY SO IT DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE SENSE -- SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE REALLY BEEN STRUGGLING WITH DEFINITELY IN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS IS A COMBINATION OF DUAL DIAGNOSIS SO WE USED WE ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH AUTISM BUT WE'RE GETTING SO MANY EXPRESSLY WITH OUR YOUNGER TEENS THAT HAVE A DUAL DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE ARE NOT TRAINED TO WORK WITH THOSE KIDS BUT WE WILL NOT NOT SERVICE THOSE KIDS WILL DO OUR BEST BUT WHEN WE MEET WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAVE A CLINICAL CONSULTATION AND EXPLAIN OUR SERVICES ARE NOT HELPING THIS CLIENT THEY MAY BE HEARING VOICES THEY MAY BE HAVING ALL THESE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT'S NOT A BE A SERVICES BUT THE CLINIC THE CLINICAL TEAM FROM THE INSURANCE PAYER WILL COME BACK AT US AND SAY YOU'RE THE ONLY OPTION YOU'RE ALL THAT THERE IS FOR THE FAMILY WE'VE GONE THROUGH EVERYTHING ELSE WELL WE WON'T STOP PROVIDING SERVICES BECAUSE WE WANT THE FAMILY DOWN SO WE STILL GO IN THERE EVERY DAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVING THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE TRAINING TO TO REALLY HELP WE DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN WE HAVE FAMILIES THAT WILL DENY SERVICES BECAUSE -- OF DIFFERENT CUSTOMS YOU KNOW SO DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT CULTURES HAVE THEIR VERY DIFFERENT BELIEFS AND SOMETIMES THERE'S A SHAME WITH A DIAGNOSIS AND FAMILIES WON'T LET US INTO THE HOMES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THE NEIGHBORS WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OR FRIENDS TO KNOW THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG HOW DO WE REACH THOSE FAMILIES HOW DO WE BRIDGE THAT HOW DO WE EMPOWER THOSE FAMILIES WELL BEING CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TOOK KNOWLEDGE THE BENEFIT THAT WE CAN GET WE HAVE CERTAIN CULTURES THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON ON ACADEMICS AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE VALUE FOR TRYING TO TEACH THEIR CHILD TO HAVE RECIPROCAL CONVERSATION SO THEY CAN INTERACT WITH PEERS AND COLLEAGUES LATER IN LIFE HOW DO WE EDUCATE THE PARENTS ARE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I IT WE NEED TO LOOK AT AS WERE AGING IS CLIENTS OUT IS WHERE DO THEY GO YOU KNOW THE PAIR JUST SAYS THE FAMILIES NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT IT'S NOT FAIR THE FAMILIES AND THAT'S NOT HOW WE DO THINGS OF THE COMPANY WE WILL NOT LET THIS PARENTS STRUGGLE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER WE'RE NOT CASE MANAGERS SO HOW DO WE GET MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE AT THE DIFFERENT REGIONAL CENTERS IN THE DIFFERENT LEVELS IN THE RESOURCES FOR THOSE FAMILIES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE SERVICES FOR THEM EVEN IF WE CAN'T BE THE ONES TO DO IT SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE ON A DAILY BASIS I THINK A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO FUNDING AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE REGIONAL CENTERS WE HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR SET UP TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE MONEY TO DO THAT FOR OUR CLIENTS AND WE NEED TO BRIDGES YOU WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THINGS LIKE ABA SERVICES AND REGIONAL CENTERS HOW DO WE HOW DO WE BRIDGE THAT GAP BECAUSE THERE'S A HUGE ALL RIGHT NOW THERE'S A HUGE ASSUMPTION FROM THE PAYERS THE INSURANCE PAIRS THE REGIONAL CENTERS TAKING OVER AND THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING SO HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND IT ALL COMES DOWN TO FUNDING YOU KNOW -- THAT'S PRETTY MUCH HOW I HAD YEAH MR LOW ANY QUESTIONS IN THE STRIP K. FLOOR I DON'T GET IT THIS GRAYSON JUST REAL QUICK -- ON YOUR LAST POINT HOW WOULD FUNDING JUST GIVE ME AN IDEA HOW WOULD FUNDING HOPE THAT TRIP -- THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN AB SERVICES AND REGIONAL CENTERS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW FOR NOT UNDERSTANDING ALL THE THINGS THE REGIONAL SERVICES OFFER AND I THINK THEY DON'T ALWAYS VOLUNTEER THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE SO I THINK BY INCREASING THE FUNDING BILL INCREASE THE ABILITY AND WEEK THEY CAN BETTER ADVERTISEMENT THESE PARENTS KNOW WHAT IS AVAILABLE AND I THINK THEY'LL BE MORE CONSISTENCY IF THEY HAVE MORE FUNDS THEY COULD BE MORE CONSISTENT FROM REGIONAL CENTER REGIONAL CENTER TO WHAT THEY OFFER I JUST ATHLETES THAT DOES THE REGIONAL CENTER HELP COVER COPAYS AND SHE SAID YES AND I SAID MY CLIENTS AREN'T GETTING THAT AND SHE SAID IT'S NOT FROM THIS AREA IS IT AND I SAID NO MY CLIENTS ARE FROM SOLANO COUNTY NAPA COUNTY AND THE REGIONAL CENTER THERE HAS NOT BEEN COVERING THAT SO HOW DO WE GET CONSISTENCY WELL MAYBE IF THEY HAVE MORE FUNDING THEY'LL IMPLEMENT THAT OCT AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT YOU BEING A SERVICE PROVIDER ARE YOU WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE REGIONAL CENTERS WE ARE WORKING WITH A COUPLE REGIONAL CENTERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET BEEN DRIES VÀ THROUGH -- NORTH BAY REGIONAL CENTER AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR REASONS THAT I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE I'M NOT PART OF THAT PROCESS SO IS THERE WE CAN FOLLOW UP ON THAT AFTER THE AFTER THE -- MEETING BUT SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE YOU'RE READY WILLING AND ABLE TO GO DO AND IF THERE'S A WAITING LIST THE NORTH BAY HAS WE HAVE A WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE THOSE CLIENTS WE HAVE THE REALLY I HAVE THE ABILITY IT'S MY JOB TO GROW THE COMPANY AND I HAVE THAT ABILITY AND WE ABSOLUTELY WANT THOSE CLIENTS NOW SOMETIMES THE PAY RATES ARE AN ISSUE AND THAT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT BUT YES I HAVE THE ABILITY BECAUSE CLIENTS WE HAVE LIKE ABA COMPANY DO NOT HAVE A WAITING LIST WE DON'T TAKE CLIENTS UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES WE NEVER SAY NO AND PLEASE SAID MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND AND YOU TOUCHED ON THE CULTURAL ISSUES BUT AND AND THE -- HERE IMMIGRANT STATUS KIND OF HAS BEEN A AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM IN THE PAST HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE -- THE IMMIGRANT OF WHO IS AFRAID OF BEING DEPORTED OR OF OF RECEIVING SERVICES WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE IN ORDER I THINK THEY HAVE TO OBVIOUSLY BE A CERTAIN SHOW SOMETHING TO GET THE INSURANCE BECAUSE UNLESS THEY HAVE INSURANCE THEY DON'T COME TO US -- I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD FAMILIES THAT HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY THEIR CHILD WAS OF AMERICAN CITIZEN BUT THEY WERE NOT THEIR CHILD DID HAVE COVERAGE RECEIVE SERVICES BUT THEN THEY HAD TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY AND TAKE THE CHILD WITH THEM SO YEAH WE DO FACE THAT WAS RISEN THANK YOU CHAIR IDEA -- I WILL GO BACK TO THE QUESTION OF MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW OF FOR THE FIRST PRESENTER IS THERE AN AREA WHERE YOU SEE FUNDING THAT COULD BE BETTER USED IN OTHER WORDS HOW DO YOU SEE THE FUNDING OR WHERE DO YOU SEE THE FUNDING COMING FROM I THINK THAT'S KIND OF HOW YOU AS IS SEE FUNDING NOT BEING USED AT ITS MOST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE WAY THAT YOU THINK IF WE RE DIRECTED IT IT WOULD BE BETTER HONESTLY NO I DON'T BUT THEN I'M VERY I'M LIMITED MORE LIMITED IN THE ABA COMMUNITY OR ALL THE MONEY TYPICALLY COMES FROM OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES DOUBT BUT I DEFINITELY ALSO IN TOUCH ON THE FACT THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT SOME OF OUR CLIENTS YOU KNOW THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT FROM THE PAYERS THAT THERE ARE GROUP HOMES AND THERE ARE DAY PROGRAMS AND THEIR JOB TRAINING FOR THESE CLIENTS AND THERE'S NOT THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO SEE A LOT MORE THE FUNDING GO -- IT BREAKS MY HEART WHEN I HAVE TO CONVINCE ONE OF MY CLIENTS TO BE OKAY WITH SWEEPING FLOORS WHEN THEY WERE DETERMINED WHEN THEY WENT OUT IN THE JOB MARKET THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING IN TECH OR VIDEO GAMES YOU KNOW AND THE OPPORTUNITIES AREN'T THERE I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN THAT DAYS BE BIG CHANGE AND JOB TRAINING MR LOOK AT I THINK THAT'S A PART OF THE COMMENTS IN THE OBSERVATION THAT WE RELY ON INDIVIDUALS LIKE YOURSELVES TO PROVIDE US YOUR INSIGHTS IN A LEVEL OF EXPERTISE TO HELP US IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL REVENUES BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WE HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS I JUST CAME BACK FROM ANOTHER FUNCTION IN WHICH A SPEAKING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND ASSIMILATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH MONEY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE VARIOUS ISSUES HOW DO WE LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUES -- AND OR EXISTING REVENUES TO BE MORE EFFICIENT AND SERVING -- SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS AND THINK THAT'S THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION THAT WE WANT TO COLLECTIVELY AS A WHOLE ONE TO -- IS TRY TO SOLVE AND AND DO THIS TOGETHER AS WELL EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION OR SO WE HAVE AN I.

TRANSPORTATION PART I WAS WINNING AS MUCH AS I COULD OUT OF IT -- I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD EITHER BE FOR YOU OR FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE OF IT ARE IS THERE SPECIAL FUNDING THAT COMES SPECIFIC TO TRANSPORTATION AND IS THAT MONEY SO RESTRICTED THAT CAN ONLY BE USED IN ONE WAY OR CAN IT BE USED AND MULTIPLE THERE IS THERE'S LIMITATIONS IN TERMS OF MEDIAN RATES FOR TRANSPORTATION PROVIDED BY THE REGIONAL CENTERS HOWEVER I THINK AUDREY YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT PARA TRANSIT WHICH IS ACTUALLY PARA TRANSIT FUNDING THAT MANY MANY PEOPLE SERVE BY THE REGIONAL CENTER ACCESS AND SO PARA TRANSIT HAS LIMITED VANS AND THERE AREN'T AS MANY ACCESSIBLE RIGHTS ON THINGS LIKE LIFTER -- BIRTH THAT PEOPLE CAN USE AS WELL YEAH THANK YOU SO ADDRESS SO -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU AND I HAVE WORKED ON IS -- YOUR PHYSICAL WELLBEING AND YOU'RE GOING OUT RACING NOW AND SO CAN YOU TELL THE THE PANEL BUT HOW LONG YOU STAY ON THE TREADMILL OKAY THEIR OWN -- MY AND THEN THE MINUTE ON NO HELLO AGAIN STAN I'M IS TOO BIG ONE THERE DID FIFTY MINUTES TO THIRTY MINUTES FOR THE INDEPENDENT CHANNEL MAYBE WILL LET ME USE THEM FOR A LONG MAY DO MORE OVER ONE DAY ONE NOTE FOR THE PANEL TO NOTICE IT AUTHOR DOES RIDE THE BUS -- OFF WITH OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE HAVE SIGNIFICANT BOTH SPEECH AND OUR LANGUAGE COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES AND ONE DAY ONE OF OUR FOLKS CAME INTO WARMER PROGRAMS AND DIDN'T LOOK RIGHTS FOR LOOK DISABLED DAUGHTER GOT OFF DROVE UP TO THAT SIDE WATCHES IT DID YOU KNOW THAT SHE WASN'T STRAPPED DOWN THE TIPPED OVER ON THE BUS SO WE HAD TO FOLLOW SPECIALISTS REPORT DO THAT THE BUS DRIVER HAD DONE BUT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE SHE SAID HEY THAT'S NOT OKAY SO OUR FOLKS LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR OTHERS AND REPORT THAT SO YOU KNOW SHE'S A ROCKS ARE A LOT OF WAYS SO WILL BE DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ABOUT EMPLOYMENT -- SINCE FEATURES EXPLORED AND WE GOT A FEW FEW MINUTES WOULD IF YOU WOULD JUST FOR THE PANEL AND SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE AUDIENCE -- YEAH THE ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT A GREAT ECONOMY IS THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS THE BAD THING ABOUT AGREED UPON ACADEMY IS WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO SUPPORT OUR GUYS TO GET EMPLOYMENT -- SO BLOOM IS BEEN UNDER FUNDED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING LEGISLATORS SECOND SOME ACTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FULLY ACCESS -- SUMMERS COMES WITH THE RULES ALONG THE WAY SO WE EMPLOY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOLKS TO WORK ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES FULL TIME IN THE COMMUNITY TO WORK IN A COUPLE HOURS FOR FOLKS ARE PRETTY LIMITED ATER ACTUALLY WORKS ARTHUR STORE FOR US -- THE CALL WORKS IS IN THE TRAINER ADVOCATE AND MENTOR SHE ACTUALLY -- LEAVE ADVOCATE ON A BILL THAT WAS PASSED -- TO PUT CHANGING TABLES ADULT CHANGE TABLES AND PUBLIC FACILITIES SOME THERE IS A DRIVER RIGHT NOW IS IN THE SYSTEM AND WERE PRETTY WANTS YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY WHERE EMPLOYMENT FOR STATE -- WE HAVE A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WE SPEND ABOUT THIRTY MILLION ON OF THAT SUPPORTING COMPETITIVE INTEGRATE IMPLEMENT SO WE HAVEN'T PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS RELATED TO THAT AND SO THEY REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IMPROVE AND AND INCREASE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOLKS IS GET OUR GUYS ARE GREAT EMPLOYEES TO DO GREAT JOB THEY JUST WANT THE OPPORTUNITY AND ARE CHALLENGES THAT WE NEED TO BUILD A TO HAVE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM -- WITH THE PANEL IT IN SACRAMENTO MY EMPLOYMENT SPECIALISTS ARE DIRECTOR SAID YOU KNOW I'VE WAY THIS TO FORTY FOLKS WHO WANT A JOB I DON'T HAVE THE STAFF GET NOTHING DO THAT SO THAT'S REALLY ARE PROBABLY BIGGEST CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE DIRECT SERVICE PROFESSIONAL GETTING PEOPLE TO BE ABLE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY SO I GUESS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS TO THE BEAN COUNTERS IN SACRAMENTO IS THAT IF WE CREATE SUCCESSES IN THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYMENT WE TAKE PEOPLE OFF OF ASSISTANCE REDUCE ASSISTANCE ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN DIFFERENT HOUSING THAT THEY DO CURRENTLY THE OTHER THING WITH HOUSING IS NOT ONLY DO OUR FOLKS I'VE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT THEM INFORMAL HOUSING ALSO AND SO ONE OF THINGS ARE REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TRY TO DO IS LOOK AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS MULTIPLE THINGS DON'T BILL DISABILITY SPECIFIC HOUSING BILLS AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE COMMUNITY CAN LIVE IN AND OUR GUYS ARE JUST PART OF THAT MIX SO YEAH ABSOLUTELY MORE WE CAN THE MOVE PEOPLE FOR THE MORE THEY BECOME CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF SOCIETY DOES REDUCE SSI OTHER COSTS ALSO PEOPLE WHO WORK OFFICER TO PICK UP HEALTH BENEFITS AND ARE WITH THE OTHER VERY THIS HEART USUALLY JUST NOT REALLY FROM THE CITY CALIFORNIA IS THE SSI RULES MEDICARE MEDICARE AL ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON PEOPLE I CAN'T WORK BECAUSE I'M A LOSE MY SSI AS IF THAT'S THE GOLDEN TICKET AND REALITY THAT JUST MEANS

FOR MORE FUNDING SEC BEND AND PUT THE SECOND POINT S. TRANSPORTATION RENAME OF FUNNY VÀ SAYS A BONE TRANSPORTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CAN TEST PLEASE LEAVE YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM MY NAME IS DEBORAH DARDEN I LIVE IN CASTRO VALLEY I HAVE A SON WHO'S FORTY ONE YEARS OLD WHO'S ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM AND WE HAVE ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THESE YOUNG MEN HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND THIS YOUNG WOMAN BUT MY BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS MY SON WENT THROUGH AN EXPERIENCE WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THAT LANDED HIM IN PRISON FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS THE DA SAID TO US MULTIPLE TIMES I DON'T CARE THAT HE HAS DISABILITY HE WAS ALLOWED TO BE INTERROGATED AND SELF INCRIMINATE HIMSELF HE WAS CHARGED WITH THE MOST EGREGIOUS CHARGES THAT THEY COULD COME UP WITH THEY WANTED TO SENTENCE HIM TO PRISON FOR THIRTY YEARS THEY WANT TO STRIKE HIM OUT HIS FIRST TIME BEING ARRESTED THERE IF THE COMMUNITY IS WHERE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE COMMUNITY HAS GOT TO ACCEPT THEM THEY HAVE TO BE SAFE THERE THE LARGEST GROWING POPULATION IN PRISON SYSTEM PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES MY SEND IN BELONG THERE HE DIDN'T DESERVE WHAT HE GOT THERE NEEDS TO BE LEGISLATION ABOUT INTERROGATING SOMEONE WHO HAS THE MENTAL CAPACITY OF A TEN YEAR OLD THERE NEEDS TO BE LEGISLATION THAT SAYS YOU CANNOT YOU CAN ALLOW THIS PERSON SELF INCRIMINATE HIMSELF THAT YOU CANNOT LOCK HIM IN AN ADULT FACILITY AND EXPECT HIM TO FEND FOR HIMSELF IN A PLACE LIKE CORCORAN OR SAN QUENTIN WHICH ARE THE TWO PLACES THAT HE WENT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP BRING THAT ABOUT ON HIS BEHALF FAMILIES YOUR NAME AND NUMBER WILL WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER THANK WHERE YOU FROM I'M CHANCE DIRECTLY I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING CHOICES WHERE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH SAN ANDREAS REGIONAL CENTER TO CREATE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HOUSING NEEDS THE HOUSING CRISIS AS IT'S AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO PUT OUT SOME SOLUTIONS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD YOU SEVERAL TIMES ASKED FOR SOLUTIONS -- ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUT PARTICULARLY IN THE BAY AREA WHICH IS THE COMMUNITY THAT I KNOW PASSED BETWEEN SIXTY PERCENT AND SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ADULTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE LIVING IN THE HOME OF AGING PARENTS IF YOU TALK TO ANY OF THOSE PARENTS BUT THEY'LL TELL YOU IS I HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE I'M WORRIED I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN I'M NO LONGER ABLE TO BE THE HOUSING PROVIDER AND THE PRIMARY SERVICE PROVIDER FOR MY ADULT SO HOUSING IS A HUGE NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY AND -- THEY NEED IS GROWING THIRTY TO FORTY YEAR OLD RANGE IS ABOUT TO DOUBLE AND THAT INCREASE IS GOING TO CONTINUE BECAUSE OF AN INCREASE IN THE AUTISM DIAGNOSIS THAT BEGAN ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AGO THE OTHER FACTOR IS ARE ADULTS ARE LIVING LONGER THANKS HER SERVICE SYSTEM -- SO WE NOW SEE MOST PEOPLE LIVING INTO THEIR SIXTIES AND BEYOND WHEN BEFORE THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF IN THE EARLY FIFTIES ON THE HOUSING CRISIS IS SOMETHING THAT A FAX CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AND PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS BUT IT TAKES THE GREATEST TOLL ON THE MOST VULNERABLE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES -- WE WORK WITH SENATE RACE WE DON'T CENTER TO HELP PEOPLE APPLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THERE'S A HUGE SHORTAGE AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED TO CREATE SPECIFIC HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WITH STATE HOUSING FINANCE SOURCES TARGETED TO PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT DISABILITIES BECAUSE WE NEED TO CONNECT THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS WONDERFUL SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE TO OUR REGIONAL SENT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA ALL OF OUR STATE FINANCED AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF THE UNITS BE ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO NEED PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU THAT PEOPLE WITH MENTAL AND COGNITIVE DISABILITIES HAVE THE SINGLE HIGHEST RATE OF HOUSING DISCRIMINATION OF ANY OTHER DISABLED GROUP SO WE HAVE THIS TARGET FOR CREATING ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES WE SHOULDN'T CONTINUE TO PRODUCE STATE HOUSING FINANCE SOURCES WITHOUT A TARGET FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE YOU BASS ABOUT FUNDING SOURCES THAT'S A FINANCING SYSTEM THAT ALREADY EXCESS WHAT YOU NEED TO GO IN IS AND RETOOL THAT FINANCING SYSTEM SO THAT PEOPLE WITH INTENSE INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ARE INTENTIONALLY INCLUDE IF YOU DON'T INTENTIONALLY INCLUDE US WITH THE SUPPORT OF SERVICE SERVICES FROM THE REGIONAL CENTER WE WILL BE LEFT OUT AND HIS PARENTS AGE WE'RE GOING TO SEE A GROWING PHENOMENON OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG SEVERELY DISABLED ADULTS FINANCING SOURCES EVERY OTHER SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION HAS A TARGETED HOUSING FINANCE IMAGE CRAP OKAY SO LOOK AT BOTH OF THOSE PLEASE THANK YOU STATE YOUR NAME AND WHERE YOU'RE FROM ABIGAIL OCCURRED I I'M WITH EASTER SEALS BAY AREA AND WALNUT CREEK AND I'M TAYLOR ASHFORD FOR YOUR REPRESENTING THE KALEIDOSCOPE COMMUNITY THANK YOU OUR HERE REPRESENTING THE KALEIDOSCOPE COMMUNITY ADULTS PROGRAM WHICH IS -- HELD THROUGH EASTER SEALS BAY AREA PROVIDES VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS LIFE SOCIAL AND INDEPENDENCE SKILLS -- FOR ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND SPECIAL NEEDS -- OUR BIGGEST HURDLE IS TRANSPORTATION UNFORTUNATELY -- THE TRANSIT PROVIDERS WHO ARE WILLING TO PROVIDE TRANSIT FOR OUR CLIENTS -- ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT FUNDED THROUGH REGIONAL CENTER OF EAST BAY -- COUNTY CONNECTION EAST BAY TRANSIT HAVE VERY SOLIDLY RESULTED IN DISQUALIFICATION FOR ALL OF OUR PARTICIPANTS TO DATE ONE CLIENT WHO IS NEW TO THE AREA HIS FAMILY'S HOME WAS DESTROYED IN HURRICANE HARVEY THEY LIVE HERE NOW HE DOES NOT KNOW THE AREA SO HE HAS QUOTE UNQUOTE FAILED HIS INTERVIEWS WITH SOME OF THESE TRANSIT PROVIDERS -- TO OTHERS GET VERY NERVOUS AROUND FIGURES OF AUTHORITY AND GIVE THE ANSWERS THEY THINK WILL APPEASE THEIR INTERVIEWERS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE INCORRECT AND THAT RESULTS IN THEIR DISQUALIFICATION -- WE ALSO HAVE -- PARENTS WHO ARE PAYING UBER OUT OF THEIR POCKET TO SEND THEIR THEIR CHILDREN TO OUR PROGRAM WE ALSO HAVE PARENTS WHO CARPOOL IT RESULTS IN THEM BEING LATE TO WORK AND THEY'RE BEING REPRIMANDED OUT WORK IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOBS THEIR CHILDREN NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE AT HOME NOW WE HAVE FIVE CLIENTS HERE IN CONCORD WHO ARE READY AND WAITING TO JOIN OUR PROGRAM HOWEVER THEY CAN'T JOIN WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION SO -- WE DESPERATELY NEED BETTER EDUCATION FOR SOME OF THESE TRANSIT PROVIDERS FOR THEIR INTERVIEW PROCESS SO IT'S MORE SUS SYNC MORE TAILORED TO OUR PARTICIPANTS AND WE ALSO NEED WELL AS MORE FUNDING SO WE CAN HAVE THOSE WILLING TRANSIT PROVIDERS ACT LEE TAKE OUR PARTICIPANTS SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE GONNA IMPROVE THEIR LIVES AND I CAN BE ABLE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY THANKS THANK YOU SO MUCH PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WERE YOU FROM NANCY EDDIE I'M FROM FREMONT I'M THE MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN WITHIN REGIONAL CENTER THE EAST BAY AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF DEAF PLUS ADULT COMMUNITY A DAY PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF WITH SPECIAL NEEDS -- YOU KNOW ALL THE SAME ISSUES HOUSING TRANSPORTATION EVERYTHING AFFECTS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DEAF BUT IT'S AMPLIFIED BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE COMMUNICATION IN THE BAY AREA THAT WILL ACCEPT SOMEBODY WITH BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES AND PROVIDE COMMUNICATION THAT'S REALLY A SHAME -- I'VE HAD PEOPLE COME TO FREMONT FROM AS FAR AS YOUR IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WE NEED MORE OF THESE ISSUES I'D ASK THAT YOU THINK IN TERMS OF ALSO PROVIDING COMMUNICATION FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEAF -- YOU KNOW IT'S A STRUGGLE MY STAFF FOR ALL DOUBTS AS WELL -- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING BUT NOW REGIONAL CENTER WILL PROVIDE INTERPRETERS FOR THE CLASSES WE HAVE TO GO TO -- THAT'S NOT TRUE IN OTHER REGIONAL CENTERS NECESSARILY SO I THINK JUST ONE MORE PIECE TO THE PUZZLE IS THE DEAFNESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER WE HAVE HAVE AN HONORABLE X. FISHY -- THAT WAS -- VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN THE LEGISLATURE JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE THANK THANK YOU FOR MEMBER AND AND -- PROUD TO BE HERE AND THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE AND AND -- FOR HAVING THE SELECT COMMITTEE AND EVERYBODY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS SO OF AT LEAST A SAID SHE KIND OF GAVE A LOT OF THE BULLET POINTS AS TO WHAT THE KIND OF THE LOW HANGING FRUIT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE YOU KNOW THAT THE HALF DAY THE HOLIDAYS -- THE THE THE MEDIAN RATES IF YOU COULD GIVE US A LOT MORE MONEY BUT IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THE MEANING RATES WE CAN'T SPEND IT -- SO REALLY IS KIND OF A A BIG BIG PROBLEM TO US -- ALSO THOSE OF ABOUT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THE MONEY WILL IT'S REALLY MAKING IT A PRIORITY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN NO NET INCREASE IN SIXTEEN YEARS -- I KNOW WE HAD AN INCREASE A COUPLE YEARS AGO THOUSAND BACK FILL FROM CUTS THAT WE HAD DURING MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE -- SO -- ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE STATE BUDGET YOUR EDUCATION A LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPT ARE THEY IF THEY DON'T HAVE AN INCREASE EVERY YEAR IT'S IT'S A CRISIS -- WE GO SIXTEEN YEARS -- WITHOUT A NET INCREASE IT'S A IT'S A CATASTROPHE MISSION HOPE DAY PROGRAM WE SIR FOREIGN FIFTY A BEHAVIORAL CLIENTS -- EVERY DAY WE HAVE A TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM -- IS SEVERELY UNDERFUNDED BUT TRANSPORTATION FOR EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL -- YOU KNOW AND YOU IN THE IN A GREAT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THAT -- IF YOU ALL THE IDEAS FOR SELF DETERMINATION -- PERSON CENTERED OF PLANNING AND AND PROGRAMS IF YOU CAN'T GET THERE THEN IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- YOU ASK A OF CUSTOM INSIDE BASEBALL STUFF IS TO WILL HOW CAN MAKE THINGS BETTER ONE THING IS THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS KIND OF THE RATES WITHIN THE RATES SO IF YOU -- IF YOU FIND -- COMMUNITY IF YOU JUST DO THE STANDARD THING OF WELL WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EVERYBODY A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE ACROSS THE BOARD -- THAT ISN'T REALLY TAKE SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES OUT OF IT FOR INSTANCE AT MISSION HOPE IN OUR WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND OUR RATES FOR TRANSPORTATION FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND FORTY SIX NINETEEN THIRTY TWELVE DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS TWELVE HOURS AND THIRTY EIGHT CENTS AND SO IF YOU GIVE EVERYBODY AN INCREASE THEN A FIVE PERCENT INCREASE THAN THOSE ONES THAT ARE STOCK -- JUST HAPPENSTANCE THAT THEY STARTED THE PROGRAM AND THEY GOT CAUGHT IN THIS IN THIS RATE STRUCTURE -- THEY'RE STILL WAY UNDER FUNDED AND SO KIND OF A OF A RESET AND HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT'S A REALISTIC FUNDING LEVEL FOR FOR ALL THESE PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF JUST KIND OF RATIONING UP WHAT HISTORICALLY HAS BUILT UP WOULD BE -- SOMETHING TO REALLY LOOK AT IT'S A LOT HARDER WORK BUT IT MAKES MORE SENSE -- AND THEN FINALLY -- WITH EVERYBODY REPRESENTED HERE -- HAVING THESE COMMITTEE MEETINGS -- ARE ARE FANTASTIC BUT GET OUT THERE AND AND VISIT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND SEE PEOPLE IT STARTS GETTING US AWAY FROM BEING NUMBERS ON A

THAT HAS ACTUALLY OCCURRED TO TO THIS TO THIS PROGRAMS WE PROVIDE DAY PROGRAM INDEPENDENT LIVING SUPPORTED LIVING AND ADULT RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A LOSS OF THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES -- WE'VE LOST SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD THEM ANYMORE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS -- SERVICES AND WE'VE SEEN THIS SERIOUS EROSION AND NOW WE'RE LOSING OUR DIRECT CARE STAFF TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA AND MOVE OUT OF STATE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE ANYMORE WHEN I HAVE TO COUNSEL MY STAFF LIKE I DO MANY OF OUR S. L. S. LESSER I'LL AS CLIENTS ON HOW TO FIND HOW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S A SHAME THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE FAR MORE IT SO HOW DO WE AFFORD THIS SYSTEM WELL I A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW HAD ASKED YOU KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND THE FUNDING WELL -- SOME OF THE GENERIC RESOURCES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE FIRST LIKE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES FOR SUPPORTED LIVING SERVICES YOU KNOW THAT IS A A NIGHTMARE AS A PROVIDER TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT AND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO PAY OVERTIME AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO PAY THAT OVER TIME AND SO FORTH IHS AS THE FUNDING FOR I JUST ASKED FOR ID DE THAT GENERIC RESOURCE REQUIREMENT SHOULD JUST BE GONE AND LET THE PROVIDERS ACTUALLY HANDLED THAT DIRECTLY -- AND BECAUSE IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NICE NIGHTMARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THAT SHOULD PROBABLY BE FUNDED FOR PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FILTERED AWAY FROM THE COUNTY SYSTEM AND DIRECTLY INTO THE DD SYSTEM OUR EFFORTS AT RISK AT GETTING MEDICAID FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IF WE LOOK AT THE STATISTICS CALIFORNIA IS SIX ROUTINELY INSUFFICIENT AND THE REQUIRING THOSE FUNDS FOR THE ID BE COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHERE WE CAN GET A LOT MORE DOLLARS IN -- ALSO KEEP NOT JUST KEEPING THE DC FUNDING THAT WE'RE SAVING FROM INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT BUT THE SALE OF THE PROPERTIES SHOULD STAY IN THE ID BE SERVICES THIS SYSTEM AS WELL AND ALSO REDUCING REDUNDANCIES WE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE ALL OF OUR LICENSE FACILITIES ARE UNDER TITLE SEVENTEEN AND THE REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE TO DO A ON IT OUR PROGRAMS AND THEN TITLE TWENTY TWO COMMUNICATOR LICENSING HAS TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING WHAT ONE OF THEM NOT BOTH AND FILL TO THOSE FUNDS TO US THANK YOU NEWMAN REGION WHERE YOU FROM GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN ABOUT LOBBYIST YOU GUYS KNOW OPEN SACRAMENTO -- ONE THING I DON'T SHARE VERY OFTEN SOME ALSO FATHER OF A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD -- WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO ENTERING THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY ESPECIALLY FOR YOU GUYS MAKING THE TRIP I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS A RITUAL YES MINUTE YEP I JUST WANT TO LET THE AUDIENCE KNOW EVERYBODY'S ON WIFI OVER CRASH IN THE THE LIVE STREAM SO LACKEY YOU SOMEBODY TO TO SIGN OFF A LITTLE BIT SO WE CAN AND

LOBBYIST AND THEY ARE ALWAYS AS WELL ATTENDED SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE THREE QUICK POINTS -- ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION I WORK WITH CALLED THE ALLIANCE IT'S -- NETWORK A SMALL NETWORK OF PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE BUT SOME OF THIS REFLECT MY VIEWS ON HAVING WORKED IN THIS ISSUE OR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS AS A LOBBYIST -- ONE THING YOU HAVE THE -- AND I'LL TRY NOT TO DO PLAY GROUND THAT'S BEEN COVERED ONE THING THOSE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IS A RATE STUDY THIS COMING DO WE ARE STUDYING PROVIDE THESE SERVICES IN THE SYSTEM THAT STUDY IS SUPPOSED TO COME OUT SOMETIME IN MARCH EXPERIENCE TELLS ME THAT THAT STUDY MAY OR MAY NOT SHOW UP ON TIME -- LET'S SAY IT DOESN'T WORK IT SHOWS UP ON TIME THE GAP BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE THE TIME TO REACT AS A LEGISLATURE BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY REVISED PUT SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET THAT REFLECTS INDIAN THAT REPORT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY SO ONE THING I THINK YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MOVING TO TRY TO DO IS TO PUT IN PLACE SOME KIND OF BRIDGE FUNDING REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE STUDY SAYS TO HELP THIS COMMUNITY CONTINUE ON TO SOME KIND OF FUTURE CONTEMPLATE PUTTING SOME KIND OF FUNDING IN IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR WHAT WE'RE GONNA SEE THIS RATE STUDY SECOND ISSUE THE WAITING LIST THAT IS BEEN MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES WAITING LISTS ARE TRICKY BECAUSE ONE PROGRAMS OFTEN ARE GOING TO TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE A WAITING LIST THAT DISCREDITS THEIR PROGRAM THE SECOND THING IN THAT AREA IS THAT AWAITING THIS CAN BE ONE OF TWO THINGS ALSO IT CAN BE A PERSON WHO YOU'RE WAITING TO GIVE A SERVICE TO YOU DON'T HAVE THE STAFF TO DO IT OR YOU STICK HIM IN ANOTHER SERVICE THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE UNTIL THE RIGHT SERVICES AVAILABLE FORM THAT'S ANOTHER FORM OF HOW WAITING OCCURS LAST THING ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER KNOW WHAT'S

VERY GOOD DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE HOUSING SITUATION IS IN THE ID THE FIELD -- I'VE WORKED IN THIS FIELD ABOUT FORTY THREE YEARS NOW AND WHAT I'VE SEEN IS OVER THOSE YEARS A NUMBER OF PARADIGM SHIFTS AND I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A PARADIGM SHIFT RELATED TO HOUSING I THINK WELL WHAT I SEE THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENED IS DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF OTHER AREAS OF A PERSON'S LIFE WEATHERBY RECREATION OR EMPLOYMENT THAT THERE'S BEEN A MOVEMENT TOWARD INTEGRATION AND FULL IN THE INCLUSION AND THAT'S A GREAT THING FOR ALL THE FOLKS WITH ID DE THAT'S NOW HAPPENING WITH HOUSING AND I THINK THAT'S A WONDERFUL THING -- WE HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS BUT PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BECOMING ADULTS TO DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN GROUP HOMES THEY DO NOT WANT LIVING LICENSE GROUP HOMES AND WHAT THEY'RE WANTING OUR PLACES OF THEIR OWN AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WE KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EVERYBODY LET ALONE THE PEOPLE WITH THE ID DE WHO TENDED NOT BE THE PEOPLE WHO GET ON WAITING LISTS AND THAT KIND OF THING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING COUPLE GOOD SUGGESTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD BE DOING WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF THE RENTAL SUBSIDIES MOST OF THE PEOPLE THE ADULTS WERE SERVING ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO NEED SOME KIND OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE -- WE KNOW THE HEAD SECTION EIGHT IS NOT GOING TO BE THE ANSWER AND SAID -- SAN FRANCISCO WE MAY PEOPLE PROBABLY READ THAT HOUSING AUTHORITIES IN DEBT TO BUY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS SO THERE'S NOT GONNA BE SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS THERE FOR PROBABLY THE

WE ARE STUDYING RESPITE SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT LIVING PERSON LISTENS IN INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS INSTRUCTION SERVICES IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PRICE TO PAY DISABILITIES SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS FOR EACH SERVICE WE DECIDED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH EACH PART OF THE SERVICE COST TO DELIVER THE WAGES OF STAFF THEIR BENEFITS OFFICE IN TRAINING SPACE INSURANCE PHONES COMPUTERS ETCETERA WE FOUND OUT HOW MUCH THESE RESOURCES COST BY RESEARCHING THEIR PRICES WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE WHERE DISABILITY SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS HIGHER THEIR STAFF AND PAY FOR THEIR BUSINESS QUITMAN AND RESOURCES WITHIN THIS STUDY WE TAKE THE OCCUPATIONS APPLICANTS CONSIDER ALONGSIDE DISABILITY SERVICE JOBS AND SEE HOW MUCH THEY PAY WE USE THIS INFORMATION TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH DISABILITY SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL HAVE TO PAPER LABOR COSTS GIVEN THAT DIRECT SERVICE JOBS ARE OFTEN MORE DEMANDING AND REQUIRE MORE RESPONSIBILITY THE SAME CALCULATION CONSIDERATIONS WILL NEED TO BE MADE FOR ORGANIZATION SUPERVISORS TRAINERS AND MANAGERS AND OF COURSE BESIDES EMPLOYEES THE BUSINESS DISABILITY SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE TO PAY FOR INSURANCE RANT PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR ACCOUNTING TAXES LAWYERS COMPUTER SOFTWARE OFFICE SUPPLIES AND VARIETY OF OTHER ITEMS THEN WHEN THE STATE SET PRICES FOR SERVICES USING A REAL COSTS CLIENTS IN THE FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS COMPETING FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND AS YOU HAVE HEARD THIS EVENING IF PRICES ARE TOO LOW SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS WILL STOP ACCEPTING NEW CLIENTS STOP DEVELOPING NEW SERVICES OR GO OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH IS WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE CLIENT CHOICE AND QUALITY THAT FOLLOWS IS FOR THE STATE TO SET PRICES BASED ON THE MARKET COSTS LAST WEEK AT THE TOWN HALL AND HE WORD WE RELEASE PRELIMINARY DATA ON LOCAL COSTS FOR RESPITE SERVICES WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELEASE DATA ON THE OTHER FOR SERVICE CODES AS THEY ARE COMPLETED WITH THE FINAL SIMILAR REPORT HOPEFULLY TO BE RELEASED BY THE END OF

HEARING OUR VOICES THIS EVENING MY NAME IS JENNY WILCOX THE CASE MANAGER AT THE ADAPTIVE LEARNING CENTER HERE IN CONCORD ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND FIGHT FOR HIGHER WAGES FOR HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS HERE'S WHY OUR COST OF LIVING INDEX IS BASED ON THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ONE HUNDRED CONTRA COSTA COUNTY'S OVERALL COST OF LIVING IS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE POINT NINE NEARLY DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THE COST OF LIVING HAS INCREASED AT ITS FASTEST RATE IN TEN YEARS GAS PRICES ALONE HAVE SURGED NEARLY TWENTY FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT THIS PAST YEAR AND HOUSING IS THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN THE COST OF LIVING DIFFERENCE MANY EMPLOYEES WORKING IN HUMAN SERVICES ARE LOW WAGE WORKERS IN CANNOT ADEQUATELY THEY DON'T ACTUALLY ADEQUATELY MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO TO TO TO PROVIDE THEIR FAMILY'S NEEDS TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES NEEDS I'M WORKING IN HUMAN SERVICES CAN BE STRESSFUL AND DEMANDING HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS NEED A BROAD RANGE OF SKILLS INTERPERSONAL SKILLS PROBLEM SOLVING COMMUNICATION SKILLS PATIENTS THE LIST GOES ON HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS ARE COURAGEOUS THEIR COMPASSIONATE WHICH IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO RETAIN AND PROVIDE THE QUALITY SUPPORTS THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES RELY SO HEAVILY UPON MANY FAST FOOD CHAINS HAVE STARTING WAGES A QUICK LENT OR HIGHER TO THOSE WORKING IN HUMAN SERVICES AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE HIGHLY SKILLED TO WORK IN A FAST FOOD CHAINS SUCH AS IN AND OUT BURGER STARBUCKS JUMBA JUICE WHERE WAGES START OUT THE SAME AS AS HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS SOMETIMES HIGHER OR EQUIVALENT SO THAT'S CONCERNING ITS CONCERNING ON A VARIETY OF LEVELS ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RETENTION A HIGH TURNOVER RATE IMPACTS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SUPPORT AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE THIS EVENING I'M HERE TO TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HIGHER WAGES FOR HUMAN SERVICE WORKERS TO RETAIN QUALITY EMPLOYEES THAT OFFER ADEQUATE SUPPORTS THE INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT RELY UPON SO THANK YOU PLEASE -- NAME IS -- JAMES HERE MOTO I LIVE IN BRENTWOOD AND I'M A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST WITH THE PLAN WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT I WORK RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY LIVE RIGHT ACROSS STREET FROM WHERE I WORK PSYCHOLOGIST BEEN DOING THAT FOR ALMOST TWENTY PLUS YEARS I'VE ALSO BEEN -- WORK FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC CENTER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FREMONT PART OF THIS SEVEN YEARS THEN PROFESSOR AND A PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR SEVEN PLUS YEARS AND BEEN ELECTED SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER TWICE SOMETHING KNOWN VERY WELL -- GIVEN THAT -- I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT GETTING FUNDING FOR THE REGIONAL CENTERS EARLY EARLY IDENTIFICATION EARLY EARLY INTERVENTION IS THE KEY BIRTH TO THREE IF WE DON'T GET THEM OR IF THEY DON'T GET SERVICES EARLY IT TAKES THAT MUCH LONGER FOR THE BENEFITS TO OCCUR THAT'S WHERE IT SO THERE'S A DOMINO EFFECT IF THEY DON'T GET THE FUNDING IT'LL IMPACT THE SCHOOLS AND THEN THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES LONGER AND MORE IMPACTED SO MY COLLEAGUES IN THE REGIONAL CENTERS DESPERATELY NEED THIS AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE HUGE GIGANTIC CASELOADS THAT THAT'S IN A LOT OF TURNOVER THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE KIDS TURNING THREE YET SOMETIMES AND GET US THAT INFORMATION RIGHT AWAY WHERE WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO DO THE ASSESSMENTS AND THEN LEGAL THINGS START HAPPENING WITH SCHOOLS -- IT WAS BY THAT THAT -- BY ABA SERVICES AND IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE MANDATED ONCE YOU HAVE AN ID P. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE THAT'S THAT'S IT SCHOOL DISCRIMINATED BRED PROVIDE SERVICES -- IF THE NEED IS THERE AND SOME DISTRICTS BECAUSE OF LEGAL ISSUES ARE ARE ARE LOCAL TO TWO TO FORM THAT OUT THEY TRY TO DO IT IN HOUSE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BEHAVIOR TAX IN BE INVENTED FUNDING FORMULA FOR EDUCATION HERTZ GROWING DISTRICTS LIKE BRENT WOULD BRENTWOOD HAS ONE OF THE LOWEST EIGHTY EIGHT BASE RATES IN THE STATE IF YOU LOOK IT UP YET OUR HOUSING COSTS ARE ASTRONOMICAL SO ONE WOULD THINK THAT HOUSING COSTS SCHOOLS GET FUNDING NOW IT'S NOT THAT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE VILLE AND MOUNT HOUSE FALLING TO THE SAME RAPID GROWTH IN AN AGRARIAN AREA FUNDING SOURCES ARE REALLY MINIMAL FOR THE SCHOOLS IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS TWO HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT DIFFERENCE SOME EVEN FAR GREATER THAN THAT

THERE'S NOT THE WORK FORCE -- BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THE WORK THEY WANT TO BUT THEY CAN'T THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU HI GOOD EVENING MY NAME THEIR EXACT MAN I HAVE THE DISTINCT HONOR AND THE DISTINCT CHALLENGE TO BE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER WE SERVE ABOUT ONE LAUGH WE SERVE ABOUT NINETY SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE AND SAN MATTEO SAN FRANCISCO IN MARIN COUNTIES -- EARLIER SPEAKER TALKED ABOUT THE PERCENTAGE ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF COST OF LIVING -- WE'RE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MARIN COUNTY IS NOW MY AN EXPENSIVE COUNTY WHICH I TAKE NOTE AND IN GLEE OF OF TELLING THEM -- SO I WORK IN THE FIELD FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS MOSTLY WITH PROVIDER STARTED IN DIRECT SERVICE IN A SHELTERED WORKSHOP AND WORKED IN SUPPORT OF LIVING IN RESIDENTIAL AND -- RESPITE AN AFTER SCHOOL RECREATION -- AND I'VE BEEN WITH THE GOLDEN GATE REGIONAL CENTER NOW FOR ON ON COMING ON THREE YEARS AND I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE AND CIVIL RIGHTS THAT'S ONE FROM TRUMAN IN THE FIELD BUT I'M REALLY GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TWO STRUCTURAL THINGS THAT I THINK ARE GOING TO MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE NEXT DECADES WHICH IS -- MEDIAN RATES AND -- THE FUNDING OF REGIONAL CENTERS AND TO TRY TO ADD SOMETHING HOPEFULLY NEW TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT -- MEDIAN RATES IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA -- WHEN I WAS -- STARTED OUT AND THROUGH TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN DIFFERENT WAYS THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE COST OF PROVIDING SUPPORT IN THE RATES THAT WERE PAID FOR SUPPORT WILL AND I AM PROBABLY ONE OR TWO OTHER PEOPLE REMEMBER COST STATEMENTS WERE YOU IN FOR PROVIDERS ARE YOU RECORDED HOW MUCH IT COSTS THAT WERE ALLOWABLE COSTS HE DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU SERVED IT WASN'T A PERFECT SYSTEM BUT YOU IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT IT COSTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES -- AND SO THAT ENDED IN NINETY SIX NINETY SEVEN FOR THE BIG SERVICES AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE REGIONAL CENTERS LOS THE FLEXIBILITY TO GO NEGOTIATE RATES AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN COSTS AND RATES FELL AWAY SOMEWHERE TALKING ABOUT RATE INCREASES IT'S NOT AND IT RATE INCREASES JUST HAVING SOME RATIONAL CONNECTION BETWEEN WHAT THE COSTS ARE AND WHAT THE SERVICES ARE -- REALLY QUICKLY WITH THE LAST THING ON MEDIAN RATES AS I HAD A PROVIDER FROM THIS AREA WHO HAS ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST -- PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND RATES IN OUR AREA AND SHE WENT TO US DESPERATE FOR STAFF YOU INTO A JOB FAIR IN TROUBLE TODAY WAS PLAYING HIGHER THAN SHE COULD OFFER -- AS HER ENTRY LEVEL AND THAT SERVING FOLKS WITH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AGAIN THAT THROUGH RATES THAT ARE ON THE HIGHER END OF OUR RATES REGION CENTER FUNDING IS BASICALLY SAID SAID ON -- MECHANISM FROM THE MID EIGHTIES THAT HAS AGAIN NO CONNECTION WITH COSTS AND WE DEARLY LOVE OUR COLLEAGUE HEATHER FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT WE GET THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THE CASE MANAGERS AND I'VE GOLDEN GATE WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE STAFF AND A HUNDRED AND SIXTY OR SEVENTY CASE MANAGERS CAN MAKE TWENTY TO THIRTY PERCENT MORE WORKING FOR GOVERNMENT WORKING FOR THE COUNTIES AS SOCIAL WORKERS THEY STAY WITH US BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE FAMILIES AND THE INDIVIDUALS THEY SERVE AND ARE CONNECTED TO THEM AND BUT WE CAN DRIVE THEM AWAY IF THEY COULD JUST CANCER FIVE IN OUR AREA -- SO I'D LOVE TO TALK TO MORE ABOUT THOSE THINGS -- BUT I MEANT ZERO SO I'M GOING TO SAY THAT THE LANHAM ACT AS ITS VERY CORE IS ABOUT EQUAL ACCESS NOT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT EQUAL ACCESS TO LIVE WORK AND PLAY AND AS PEOPLE WITHOUT TO ABILITIES TO AND THE FIRST LINE IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR CITIZENS IN THERE AND DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND AT SOME POINT WITH THE SEVERE UNDERFUNDING CALIFORNIA'S NO LONGER ACCEPTING THAT RESPONSIBILITY AND I IT'S GONNA TAKE EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM TO ADVOCATE FOR THOUSANDS OF THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE YOU AND MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MCCANN AND I AM FROM ANY ARGUMENT BRAND NEW RESIDENT OF ANTIOCH
