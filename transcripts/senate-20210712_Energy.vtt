THE OPTION OF BROADBAND

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.616
SERVICE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO

00:54:46.683 --> 00:54:48.218
PROVIDER IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:49.419
OR IS IT MORE CALM THAT THEY

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:50.520
DON'T HAVE BROADBAND BECAUSE

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:52.622
IT'S EITHER TOO EXPENSIVE. THEY

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.957
DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER OR THEY

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:57.360
NEED DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING.

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:58.361
IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

00:54:58.428 --> 00:54:59.696
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FORTY

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:02.832
PERCENT. OF THE- INDIVIDUALS IN

CALIFORNIA HAVE NO ACCESS- IT'S

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:06.503
AND IT'S NOT SO MUCH

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.071
AFFORDABILITY BECAUSE- THOSE

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:10.573
WHO DO HAVE IT. IT'S POORLY

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.810
CONNECTED- AND IF YOU LOOK AT

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:16.012
THOSE WHO LIVE. IN MY DISTRICT.

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:17.380
AND YOU LOOK AT A TIME IN WHICH

00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.315
THOSE PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.817
WERE BUILT. THEIR BILL WHICH

00:55:20.884 --> 00:55:23.720
CENTER BOX SO THE INTERNET. THE

00:55:23.787 --> 00:55:25.922
SERVICES OR THE CONNECTIVE ITTY

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.124
CAN EVEN PENETRATE- GETTING THE

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:30.760
SIGNAL INTO THE HOME- THEY HAVE

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:33.329
BUFFERING DAD'S GOES ON. KIDS

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.131
INTERNET STARTS AND THEN IT

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.100
JUST CONTINUES. AND SO IT'S A

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.636
VARIETY OF ISSUES- AND THAT'S

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:41.404
JUST ONLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:42.806
YOU LOOK AT. YOU KNOW ALL OF

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:44.641
CALIFORNIA THERE'S PEOPLE WHO

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.010
HAVE NO ACCESS WHATSOEVER- WE

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:48.445
TALK ABOUT CHILDREN TRYING TO

00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.313
DISTANCE LEARNING- THEY CAN'T

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:52.515
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO.

00:55:52.582 --> 00:55:54.350
THE INTERNET THE BROADBAND-

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:56.453
SERVICE AND THIS BILL IS TRYING

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:57.854
TO ERADICATE THAT BY MAKING

00:55:57.921 --> 00:55:59.956
SURE. THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:02.959
ACCESS TO SUCH TECHNOLOGY CAN

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.728
YOU I MEAN WE HAVE STORIES IN

00:56:04.794 --> 00:56:07.030
WHICH IN MY DISTRICT. THE KIDS

00:56:07.097 --> 00:56:08.331

INTERNET ACCESS- BACK AND GO TO

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.335
THEIR PARTICULAR HOME SO THEY

00:56:12.402 --> 00:56:13.303
HAVE TO ACTUALLY GO IN THE

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:14.871
GARAGE. AND GET CONNECTED TO

00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.840
SOMEONE ELSE'S CONNECTION AND

00:56:16.906 --> 00:56:18.007
THAT THOSE ARE STORIES THAT ARE

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:20.076
REPEATED TIME AND TIME AGAIN

00:56:20.143 --> 00:56:21.678
AND SO THIS BILL IS SEEKING A

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:23.146
TO ADDRESS. IS THE SYSTEMIC

00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:25.115
PROBLEM X. SPECIALLY IN THE

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.516
PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING JUST

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.818

THIS POST I GUESS SEEMS TO

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:47.403
FOCUS ON NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. TO

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.872
PROVIDE FREE SERVICE RATHER

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:50.039
THAN TRYING TO SUBSIDIZE

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:52.242
SERVICE MAKES TEAM. BROADBAND

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:55.211

FOR THE COULD BE SERVICE IS

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.183
JUST TOO EXPENSIVE OR DO WE

REALLY NEED TO. BE GIVING

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:04.854
GRANTS TO. BUILD ALL NEW

00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:07.423
INFRASTRUCTURE. SURE I THINK WE

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.491
HAVE MISSED BUT MUCH OF THE

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:09.926
TAIL ON THE LINE WHO CAN

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:13.129

AGAIN. MISTER GIBSON FOUR

00:57:52.836 --> 00:57:54.871
THIRTY. THE SENATOR COULD POSE

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.573
A QUESTION I'M SORRY WHAT IS

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:58.241
YOUR YOU YOUR YOU CALLED ON HER

MISTER GIBSON GO TO GIVE A

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:11.287
TECHNICAL RESPONSE. OKAY SO YOU

WANT TO ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN.

00:58:12.188 --> 00:58:13.623
SURE I COULD THIS THIS BILL

00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.059
SEEMS TO FOCUS ON BUILDING NEW

00:58:16.125 --> 00:58:18.695
INFRASTRUCTURE AND- RATHER THAN

00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.996
SUBSIDIZING SERVICE MAKES THIS

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.865
TEAM. BROADBAND PROVIDERS SO I

00:58:21.931 --> 00:58:25.134
WAS JUST TRYING TO GET- EQUITY

00:58:25.201 --> 00:58:27.637
AND VENTURE PERSPECTIVE IT IS

00:58:27.704 --> 00:58:28.204
THE ISSUE AGAIN THAT THERE'S

00:58:28.271 --> 00:58:32.175
NOT. ANY SERVICE AROUND THAT

00:58:32.242 --> 00:58:34.277
THEN COULD BE SUBSIDIZED OR IS

00:58:34.344 --> 00:58:37.614
THERE REALLY THE NEED TO BUILD

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.147
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE IN MOST

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:43.286
CASES. FOR PUBLIC HOUSING

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.722
THERE'S A FEW ISSUES- ONE OF

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:46.756
THEM WOULD BE THAT SOME OF THE

00:58:46.823 --> 00:58:48.758
BUILDINGS ARE ON THE OLDER END

00:58:48.825 --> 00:58:51.227
AND SO IT'S REALLY HARD TO-

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:53.029
WIRY BACK THE WIRED UP IT

00:58:53.096 --> 00:58:54.397
WASN'T INTENDED TO BE WIRED UP

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:55.198
SO THEY NEED SOME

00:58:55.265 --> 00:58:56.900
INFRASTRUCTURE. OFFERS SOME OF

00:58:56.966 --> 00:58:58.801
THOSE LITTLE BUILDINGS AND BUT

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.603
ALSO THE OTHER THING WOULD BE

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:02.238
TO PROVIDE A BASIC DIGITAL

00:59:02.305 --> 00:59:03.539
LITERACY TO THE FOLKS LIVING IN

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:05.975
THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY

00:59:06.042 --> 00:59:06.743
OFTEN OR NOT OFTEN BUT AT

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:09.913
TIMES. THEY HAVE SOMETIMES A

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.748
COMMUNITY SPACE TO PROVIDE THE

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:13.816
DIGITAL LITERACY TRAINING BUT

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:14.951
AT OTHER TIMES THERE IS NO

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.586
SPACE AND SOME OF THE FOLKS

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.288
THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BEING

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:23.293
ABLE TO GOLD SOMEWHERE. TO TAKE

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.260
SOMEBODY'S CLASSES. OUR OUR NOT

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:24.861
REQUIRED JUST DON'T HAVE THE

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:26.396
CLINICAL- YOUR COMMUNITY THAT

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.864
MEANS I'M TALKING REALLY BASIC

00:59:27.931 --> 00:59:29.332
CLASSES LIKE. LEARNING HOW TO

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.566
YOU KNOW USE THE MOUSE AND HOW

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:32.268
TO TURN ON THE COMPUTER. ADULT

00:59:32.335 --> 00:59:34.737
CLASSES PROVIDE- YOU PROVIDE

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:36.072
SOME PROGRAMMING BUT USUALLY

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.273
ALREADY HAVE TO HAVE THOSE

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.909
BASIC SKILLS. IN ORDER TO KEEP

00:59:39.976 --> 00:59:42.312
UP IN THE CLASSES. THREE HOURS

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:44.547
IT'S THIS BILL PROVIDES. MONEY

00:59:44.614 --> 00:59:45.515
BOTH FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

00:59:45.581 --> 00:59:48.785
FREE. SERVICE AS WELL AS MONEY

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:53.556
FOR ADOPTION TRAINING SET RIGHT.

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:54.724
I WOULD AND I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:59:54.791 --> 00:59:57.126
IT WOULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE AND-

00:59:57.193 --> 01:00:00.196
ENTRY. I'M NOT SURE THAT WOULD

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:01.998
BE IT WOULD INCLUDE- POTENTIAL

01:00:02.065 --> 01:00:03.433
COMPUTERS MAYBE A COMPLETE

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:04.400
COMPUTER CENTER OR SOMETHING

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:06.369
LIKE THAT IN YOUR COMMUNITY IN

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:07.704
THEIR BUILDING. IF AT ALL

01:00:07.770 --> 01:00:12.408
POSSIBLE WHAT. THERE'S THERE

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:13.810
SENATOR THREE POINTS TO THIS

01:00:13.876 --> 01:00:15.878
BILL ONE AS CONNECTIVE ADDING

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:17.880
TO INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN

01:00:17.947 --> 01:00:20.216
THREE LITERACY- MS HERNANDEZ

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.684
TOUCHED UPON THE DELIVERY OF

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.486
THE LITERACY PART SO THIS BILL

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:25.121
WILL IN FACT SPEAK TO THE

01:00:25.188 --> 01:00:27.056
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE AGAIN

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.624
THEY'RE A FACILITY OR-

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:31.894
HOUSINGS- THAT DON'T HAVE THE-

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.529
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ABSOLUTELY

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:35.665
SUPPORT SUCH TECH THE CORRECT

01:00:35.732 --> 01:00:37.166
NEGATIVITY THAT'S THE REASON

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:38.401
WHY THERE'S THREE MAIN POINTS

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:39.836
THE CONNECTIVITY THE

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.804
INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE LITERACY-

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:45.475
THAT ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.275
EMBEDDED IN FOURTEEN TWENTY

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:46.876
FIVE. WE'LL GO NOW TO SENATOR

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:52.949
RUBIO. HEY DON'T. TAKE A GUESS

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:55.184
AT ONE MORE FOLLOW UP JUST. SO

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.319
THAT'S HELPFUL I PRETEND I

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.553
AGREE AND LIKE I SAID BEFORE

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.688
THE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THAT

01:00:58.755 --> 01:00:59.655
HOLISTIC APPROACH RIGHT IT WAS

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.124
A CLEAR ON THAT ADOPTION

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.725
SPENDING SO THAT'S EXCELLENT I

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:03.893
GUESS THE LAST QUESTION IS JUST

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.727
HOW DOES THIS ALIGN WITH THE

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.763
SPEEDS OF THE BROADBAND

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.698
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT BOTH HOUSES

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:09.532
ARE WORKING ON IT IS ALIGNED

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:12.402
WITH THE- WITH THE- THE

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:15.538
INTENDED SPEEDS OF THOSE. OF

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:16.939
THOSE LEGISLATION. WE ARE

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.107
TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGETARY

01:01:18.174 --> 01:01:19.575
BILL. I'M NOT ANSWERING YOUR

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:22.412
QUESTION. YEAH THE- THE BUDGET

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.881
TRAILER BILLS WELL THE WELL WE

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.115
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BUT IT'S

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.884
REALLY BUILT THE LOOK LIKE- WE

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:28.651
KNOW WHAT'S COMING UP ON

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:30.486
THURSDAY AND HIS BILLS BEFORE

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:33.222
US RIGHT NOW AND SO- WE'RE OUR

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:34.590
GOAL IS TO TRY TO GET THIS BILL

01:01:34.657 --> 01:01:36.559
ACROSS THE FINISH LINE-

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.628
HOPEFULLY WE CAN- THEY'LL BE

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:40.229
WORK. THAT IS NEEDED THERE'S

01:01:40.296 --> 01:01:41.531
LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET TRAILER

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.999
BILL THAT WILL SPEAK TO THE

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.801
PUBLIC SUBSIDIZED HOUSING THE

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:46.035
