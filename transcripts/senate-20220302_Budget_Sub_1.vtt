ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.634

SOME CRITICAL DETAILS AND LEAVES

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:37.884
A FEW KEY DECISIONS THE

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.185

THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.675
INCORPORATED INTO YOUR AGENDA.

00:09:02.742 --> 00:09:04.076
FOR THIS SUMMER QUESTIONS IS ON

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:08.247
pBOTTOM OF PAGE SIX. OH ONE OTHER

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.815
CONCERN WE WANT TO RAISE. THE

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.250
PROPOSAL IS A LITTLE TO TARGET

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.085
FUNDING TO SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS-

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:14.420

STUDENTS THAT ARE YASSER LOW

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.636
INCOME. WE FIND THAT AT LEAST

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:32.138
TWO THIRDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:34.140
MEET THE THRESHOLD FOR PRIORITY.

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:35.474
SUCH A BROAD DEFINITION IS

00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.809
UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:42.281
STUDENTS. THAT COULD BENEFIT

00:09:42.348 --> 00:09:43.316

STUDENTS WITH HIGHEST. FOR

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:48.721
EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:49.655
CONSIDER INCREASING THE

00:09:49.722 --> 00:09:51.324
THRESHOLD FOR PART PRIORITY FOR

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.025
DISTRICTS WITH 75% OF THEIR

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.293
STUDENT POPULATION BEING ALL

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.662
INCOME. FOR INVESTORS STUDENTS.

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.364
LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO REQUIRE

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.565
GRANTEES TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:00.866

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.210
BEGINNING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:42.147
ONE A ONE B. ONE C. ONE G. BUT-

00:14:42.214 --> 00:14:44.049
M. ONE C. IS DIFFERENT THAN ONE

00:14:44.116 --> 00:14:46.218
A. AND ONE B. ONE G. COMPARES

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.187
THE MALL SO I THINK THAT WE

00:14:48.254 --> 00:14:50.256
MIGHT ASK A FEW QUESTIONS ALONG

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:51.824
THE WAY. BUT EXPECTED OUR

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.127
DISCUSSION. MIGHT ALSO BE UNDER

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.663
ONE DAY. THEN I SENT MEANT. I

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:58.631
GUESS THE QUESTION I FOR

00:14:58.697 --> 00:15:00.799
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALTHOUGH-

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:03.068

PUBLIC ANSWERED AS WELL- THIS IS

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:08.807
A PRETTY AMBITIOUS PROPOSAL AND-

TALKING ABOUT I GUESS. THE

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:13.279
QUESTION I HAVE IS WAS THIS

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.180
PROPOSAL SOMETHING THAT WAS

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.782
DRAFTED AND DEVELOPED BY THE

00:15:16.849 --> 00:15:17.983
COMMUNITY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.984

SYSTEM. OR WAS THIS CREATED BY

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.522
THE PARDON OF FINANCE- AND I ASK

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.057
THAT IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:25.758
ARE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:27.726
RAISED ABOUT. WHETHER WE HAVE

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.495
THE DEMAND I MEAN WE DON'T AS

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:30.462
WE'VE DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:32.398
HEARINGS. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:15:32.464 --> 00:15:34.266
SIGNS OF POTENTIALLY DECLINING

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:35.200
ENROLLMENT AND COMMUNITY

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.436

GUESS THE QUESTION IS IT

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:42.641
APPROPRIATE. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

00:15:42.708 --> 00:15:44.243
GIVEN THE FACTS ON THE GROUND.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:46.412

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.380
THE CCC'S WERE SAYING. I GUESS I

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.448
GUESS THE SIMPLE QUESTION IS

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:51.216

PROPOSAL SOMETHING WAS DEVELOPED

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:59.124
PRIMARILY BY CCCS. OR IS THIS

00:15:59.191 --> 00:15:59.925

THAT THEN IS- D. DO YOU SEE THAT

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.817
THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS I MEAN

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.285
WHAT WHAT'S THAT ONE OF THE

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.953
FACTS ON THE GROUND THAT YOU

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.121
WOULD SAY JUSTIFY THIS TYPE OF

00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:31.523
SIGNIFICANT OUTLAY. I THINK WE

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.826
SEAT. YOU HAVE REALLY TWO ISSUES

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:35.928
ONE BEING. I NEED TO HAVE A

AND IN SEVERAL INDUSTRIES THAT

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:42.634
HAVE ARE DISPLAYING- THAT ARE

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.370
DISPLAYING STAFFING SHORTAGES AS

00:16:44.436 --> 00:16:47.005
WELL AS- YOU KNOW CONSISTENT

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:48.173
WITH THE OUR OUR PROPOSED BROAD

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.809
GOAL OF. HAVING 70% DEGREE

00:16:50.876 --> 00:16:52.277
ATTAINMENT YOU KNOW IMPROVING

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:54.146
OPPORTUNITIES IN COLLEGE GOING

00:16:54.213 --> 00:16:57.082
CULTURE TO HAVE MORE STUDENTS

00:16:57.149 --> 00:16:58.450
YOU KNOW HOW THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

00:16:58.517 --> 00:16:59.685
FROM HIGH SCHOOL TRANSITIONING

00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:01.620
OVER INTO OUR COLLEGE SYSTEM

00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:02.921
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND I

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:04.390
SHARE THOSE GOALS BUT IF THE

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:06.225
FACT IS IF PEOPLE DON'T ACTUALLY

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:07.226
ATTEND THESE CLASSES OR THESE

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.927
PROGRAMS- THEN WE'RE JUST

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.462
SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY FOR NO

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:11.964
GOOD PURPOSE SO. I DEFINITELY MY

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.465
MAIN CONCERN ABOUT THIS- AND IT

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.501
REALLY IS CONCERNING TO ME THAT

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.201
THIS WAS DRAFTED BY THE

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:18.470
ADMINISTRATION. NOT IN RESPONSE

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.772
TO A PARTICULAR QUESTION REQUEST

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:22.307
BY CCC- WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.276
THE PROPER ORDER OF THINGS AND

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:25.444
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:17:25.511 --> 00:17:27.346
MONEY DOESN'T MEAN WE SHOULD BE-

00:17:27.413 --> 00:17:28.914
RECKLESS WITH THAT I THINK ALL

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.749
OF OUR BUDGETARY DECISIONS OUGHT

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.484
TO BE GROUNDED IN- YOU KNOW

00:17:32.551 --> 00:17:34.253
FACTS ON THE GROUND AS I SAID IN

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.422
AND IT CONCERNS ME THAT. AT THIS

00:17:36.488 --> 00:17:38.056
APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.125
GUYS CAME UP WITH I'M NOT SURE

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:41.527
THERE'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR IT

00:17:41.593 --> 00:17:43.228
AND IT'S CENTER WHERE THE CHIRLA

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.497
POINTED OUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:47.166
NEEDS RIGHT NOW IS THAT WE COULD

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:48.801
BE ALLOCATING THOSE FUNDS TO

00:17:48.867 --> 00:17:50.369
INSTEAD COBB BUT I WILL RESERVE

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:52.938

TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.166
WHICH IS A LOT OF WHAT THE FOCUS

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:15.634
IS ON YOU KNOW THROUGH CURRENT

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:16.835
PROGRAMS TO WORKERS WERE

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:19.204
ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON NEW AREAS

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.205
WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON

00:22:20.272 --> 00:22:21.940
AREAS THAT OFTEN REQUIRE

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:24.142
SIGNIFICANT. A COLLEGE EDUCATION

COLLEGE EDUCATION I'M SO

00:22:27.446 --> 00:22:28.513
CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.549
ARE FOCUSED ON WE DON'T THINK

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:31.783
THE CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.285
NECESSARILY FOCUSED ON THOSE

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:34.953
PARTICULAR HERE LET ME ASK A

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.788
FOLLOW UP. YOU MIGHT NEED TO

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:40.125
HEAR. AND THE FOLLOW UP IS-

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.127
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT THE SENATOR

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:44.429
WAS TRYING TO ASK IS THIS IS AN

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:48.400
OVERLAY TO OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:50.902
THAT DOESN'T DUPLICATE THEM AND

00:22:50.969 --> 00:22:53.672
ADDS TO THEM. AND THE BASIC

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.540
UNDERLYING PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS

00:22:55.607 --> 00:22:57.309
NOW WILL CONTINUE AND IF THIS

00:22:57.375 --> 00:22:59.377
WAS APPROVED THIS WOULD BE AN

00:22:59.444 --> 00:23:04.516
OVERLAY THAT WOULD ADD. TO IT.

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:05.650
IS THAT CORRECT. YEAH THAT WOULD

00:23:05.717 --> 00:23:07.652
BE GREAT OKAY. IT AND THE

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:09.755
SENATOR MAY HAVE WANTED TO KNOW

00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:12.791
OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING

00:23:12.858 --> 00:23:14.493
THE OVERLAY BUT I THINK THAT

00:23:14.559 --> 00:23:16.695

BEING CLARITY ON HOW THIS WILL

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:07.705
ADDRESS THE BARRIERS THAT ARE

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.207

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.591
IS JUST. AND UNDER- ENROLLMENT.

00:30:26.658 --> 00:30:28.359
IN THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF

00:30:28.426 --> 00:30:29.761
STUDENTS THAT COULD BE TAKING

00:30:29.827 --> 00:30:30.762
ADVANTAGE OF DUAL ENROLLMENT

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.630
OPPORTUNITIES WE KNOW THAT THE

00:30:32.697 --> 00:30:34.732
DATA CLEARLY DISPLAYS. THAT

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:37.068
STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN DUAL

00:30:37.135 --> 00:30:38.269
ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS ARE MORE

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:40.572
LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE- SO

00:30:40.638 --> 00:30:42.674
CERTAINLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S SORT

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:45.043
OF OUR FOCUS AND THE PROBLEM

00:30:45.109 --> 00:30:45.610
WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS IS

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.845
MEDIAN. TAKE IN THE NUMBER OF

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:51.749
STUDENTS THAT ARE PARTICIPATING

00:30:51.816 --> 00:31:07.732
IN DUAL ENROLLMENTCULTURE AND- THAT ALSO HAS THE

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:10.268
BENEFIT OF YOU KNOW REDUCING

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.036
TIME 2 DEGREES USING STUDENTS

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:14.772
COST TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE DEGREE-

00:31:14.839 --> 00:31:16.641
BY ENABLING THEM TO EARN COLLEGE

00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.076
CREDITS WHILE THERE AND IN HIGH

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.711
SCHOOL. I THINK THAT THAT'S OUR

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:22.413
PRIMARY FOCUS K. AND S. I WOULD

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.182
JUST MAKE A COMMENT WHICH IS

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:26.584
HOME. I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:29.654
TIMES WHERE. EVERYBODY AGREES ON

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:32.290
THE GOAL. THIS IS DESIGNED TO

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.791
ADDRESS THE GOAL BUT THEY'RE

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.426
STILL A LITTLE BIT OF A LACK OF

00:31:35.493 --> 00:31:37.428
CLARITY OF HOW THIS WILL

00:31:37.495 --> 00:31:38.630
ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM SO

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:40.765
I JUST HOPE OVER THE TIME

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:43.334
BETWEEN NOW AND MAY- THAT THAT

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.436
ISSUE IS CONSIDERED OUR ANY

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:46.938
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:50.908
ON THIS. CENTER ROADSHOW. SO S.

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:53.411
WHO'S- OF A TWENTY TWO AND A

00:31:53.478 --> 00:31:55.747
TWENTY YEAR OLD AND THEY WENT

00:31:55.813 --> 00:31:57.048
THROUGH- THEIR HIGH SCHOOL AND

00:31:57.115 --> 00:31:59.150
THEY DID PROVIDE DUAL ENROLLMENT

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:01.452
ON THERE. MY CHILDREN TOO AB

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:04.322
CLASSES. AND ONE OF MY KIDS

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:06.291
ACTUALLY WENT IN WITH ENOUGH

00:32:06.357 --> 00:32:08.192
CREDITS WITH AID TO BE A JUNIOR

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:09.594
. BUT THE QUESTION I'M I'M

00:32:09.661 --> 00:32:11.496
TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE BARRIERS

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:13.164
RIGHT NOW TO DUAL ENROLLMENT

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:15.533
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.235
WHY WE DID NOT CHOOSE TO DO THAT

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:18.736
AND I WASN'T SURE WHETHER OR

00:32:18.803 --> 00:32:20.471
NOT. IT WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT

00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:21.773
. FEEDING AND WITH THE BOTH A

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:24.976
HIGH SCHOOL. DIPLOMA ALONG WITH

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:27.412
A CERTIFICATE OR- DID IT

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:30.381
EFFECTIVE- THEIR GPA WHAT WHAT.

00:32:30.448 --> 00:32:33.251
SORT OF. OBSTACLES YOU SEE TO

00:32:33.318 --> 00:32:36.120
HAVING- ARE GOING THROUGH THE

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:39.924
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. FOR

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.993
STUDENTS WHO ARE FOR HIGH SCHOOL

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.928
SAID I HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.697
AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:48.733
THOSE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.400
HIGH SCHOOLS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE

00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.169
THE PROGRAM. SURE RIGHT I THINK

00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:52.503
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE JUST

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:54.072
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:55.306

SUPPORT SERVICES TO ALWAYS BE

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:58.443
SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE LEVEL

00:32:58.509 --> 00:33:00.378

RECENT REPORTS FROM THE PUBLIC

00:33:09.887 --> 00:33:11.389
POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:12.757
ARE INDICATING THAT MANY OF THE

00:33:12.824 --> 00:33:14.058
DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSE OPTIONS

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.027

FOCUSED ON REMEDIAL. COURSEWORK

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:20.198
THE DOES NOT COUNT FOR COLLEGE

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:22.633
CREDIT- SHOULD CERTAINLY I THINK

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.669
WE'RE TRYING TO CHIU FOCUSED ON

00:33:24.736 --> 00:33:26.204

ENTERING A COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.913
SO THAT I IT HELPS WITH TIME

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.815
2 DEGREES FORWARD WHEN WE THINK

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:39.751
ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE BARRIERS

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:41.352
THAT ADDS A HIGH SCHOOLS ONE OF

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.553
THE BARRIERS THAT WE PERTAINING

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.589
TO LEAVE FROM SCHOOLS. IS THAT

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:48.059
THE STAFFING IF YOU WERE A

DEVELOP THE AGREEMENTS TO

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:52.263
ENTRENCH. I WOULD THIRD LOOK

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.898
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO PULL

00:33:53.965 --> 00:33:56.667
TOGETHER THE DIP COURSE ON AND-

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.336
THE THAT THERE IS. A NEED

00:33:58.403 --> 00:34:00.438
SUPPORT FOR THEM TO HAVE A

00:34:00.505 --> 00:34:02.240
SUPPORT PERSON THE POLL THAT.

00:34:02.306 --> 00:34:04.809
TOGETHER INITIALLY- AND THEN THE

00:34:04.876 --> 00:34:06.511
SECONDARY PIECE THAT WE PUT

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:07.979
FORWARD WHICH IS YOU KNOW

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.514
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS TO MAKE

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.648
SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.216
STUDENTS. IN TAKING THOSE

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.852
COURSES FOR THEIR SUCCESSFUL-

00:34:14.919 --> 00:34:16.387
WHEN THEY TAKE THAT COURSE THE

TYPES OF STUDENTS IN THESE

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.797
COURSES- AND CERTAINLY- THE DATA

00:34:25.863 --> 00:34:27.698
DOES SUGGEST AT THE MOMENT THAT.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.267
THERE MAY BE SOME EQUITY ISSUES

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.669
AND WHO IS ACCESSING CURRENT-

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:33.871

THESE COURSES STATEWIDE- WE KNOW

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:50.354
IT VARIES DEPENDING ON WHAT AREA

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.356
OF THE STATE YOU YOU ARE LOCATED

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:54.759
IN AND WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERY

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.194

ACCESS TO THESE PROGRAMS I TRULY

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:12.910
TRULY APPRECIATE THE MERIT

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:15.913
BEHIND THAT. AND THEN ONE LAST

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.981
QUESTION- THE CURIOUS BECAUSE

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.516
RIGHT NOW WHY IS THE

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:19.817

WILL NEED ON GOING- OUR- SUPPORT

00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:27.725
. SURE I THINK FROM OUR

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:28.960
PERSPECTIVE IT GETS THE BALANCE

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.795
OF AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:32.430
EIGHT RESOURCES- THAT WE HAVE

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:34.432
BEFORE US TODAY SO IT IT DEPENDS

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:36.601
ON THE SPECIFIC FISCAL YEAR- IT

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:39.003
JUST DEPENDS ON. WHETHER YOU

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:41.072
KNOW THE WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:42.073
TO WHETHER THOSE FUNDS ARE ONE

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:44.008
TIME OR ONGOING YOU KNOW-

00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.310
THERE'S ROUGHLY A BALANCE THAT

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.145
SPLIT BETWEEN AVAILABLE ONGOING

00:35:48.212 --> 00:35:49.647
RESOURCES AVAILABLE ONE TIME

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.682
RESOURCES WE'RE JUST TRYING TO

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:53.451
MAXIMIZE. THE ONE TIME RESOURCES

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.519
WE HAVE OVER A MULTI YEAR

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.687
PERIOD- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE NOT

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:58.923
IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE- YOU

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:01.092
KNOW THE LEVEL OF- ONGOING

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.260
RESOURCES THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:05.196
ONGOING COMMITMENT IN THIS AREA

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.697
. SERVICE MEAN THAT THIS

00:36:06.764 --> 00:36:08.733
PARTICULAR FUNDING YOU WILL

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.635
ACTUALLY SET IT ASIDE TO ASSURE

THAT IT ACTUALLY. IS AVAILABLE

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:14.639
FOR THE FOLLOWING COUPLE WHAT IS

THESE PROGRAMS AND I THINK- YOU

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.431
KNOW ASKING THE SIDE BY SIDE YOU

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.467
CAN SEE THE AREAS WHERE THEIR

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:44.635
SIMILARITIES THEY ALL ARE TRYING

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.503
TO GET TO THE SORT OF SAME LONG

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.506
TERM. GOAL IN A LOT OF WAYS OF

00:46:49.573 --> 00:46:50.374
INCREASING- THE EDUCATION AND

SKILLS THAT THAT STUDENTS HAVE

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.911
SO THEY CAN FIND OCCURS IN THE

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:56.413
WORKFORCE- BUT THEY DO HAVE

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.749
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- ELEMENTS FOR

00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.883
DOUBLE THE COVERAGE OF

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.519
PARTICULAR- HAS A GREATER FOCUS

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:05.822
ON- ALIGNING WITH EIGHT ZERO

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:06.957
COMMENTS THURMOND THAT THEIR

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.559
PROPERTIES ARE GETTING A FOUR

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:10.594
YEAR DEGREE I THINK I WOULD JUST

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:11.795
RE READING SOME OF OUR CONCERNS

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:13.931

ADDITION TO THE EXISTING ONGOING

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.202
PROGRAMS THAT EXIST- BUT

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:19.269
CRITICAL EDUCATION. BUT THIS IS

WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:27.644
REQUIREMENTS OF THE BE A THREAT

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:28.912
TO BE BURDENSOME I'M I THINK

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:31.315
OTHER THING I WOULD I WOULD NOTE

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:33.183
THAT ON ON THIS ISSUE OF AND TRY

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.185

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:43.427
ROUTE WORST COLLEGE AGREED

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:45.329
OUTCOMES I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.364
THAT IS PART OF THE GOAL OF THE

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:48.732
BOB DOLE ENROLLMENT OTHERS AND

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:49.666
SOME OF THE RECENT REPORTS THERE

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:51.535
WAS- PARENTS THAT THE BENEFIT OF

00:47:51.602 --> 00:47:53.237
DOING THAT ARE NOT SPREAD EVENLY

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:54.972
THROUGHOUT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE

00:47:55.038 --> 00:47:57.808
WE CAN GIVE YOU DO OF COURSE ANY

00:47:57.874 --> 00:47:58.809
OF THESE OPTIONS WE THINK

00:47:58.875 --> 00:47:59.910
THERE'S ROOM FOR MAKING

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:00.744
IMPROVEMENTS TO THESE PROPOSALS.

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:02.713

PROPOSALS ARE MIND ADDRESSES ANY

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.816
OF THOSE ISSUES ARE BETTER THE

PRIORITIZATION OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:09.152

MADE TO THE PREVIOUS ONE AS WELL

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:12.716
WE CURRENTLY HAVE SIX COMMUNITY

COMPLETELY. UNUTILIZED EVER

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.711
TRYING TO MAKE ARE. GREATER

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:43.280

IF IT WORKS. MANY TO TAKE THAT

00:49:52.322 --> 00:49:54.057
QUESTION GOOD MORNING CENTER

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:56.893
CHAU BLOKE. AT THE WE ACTUALLY

FIFTY FIFTY EIGHT OF OUR

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:03.934
DISTRICTS HOW DO ON ROLE MEANT

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.235
PROGRAMS. SINCE THESE ARE ONE

00:50:05.302 --> 00:50:07.838
TIME DOLLARS A TEN MILLION ON

00:50:07.904 --> 00:50:10.874
THE OF WAR IT WAS LIMITED FUNDS

00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:13.710
ONLY A SEVEN. PARTNERSHIPS COULD

00:50:13.777 --> 00:50:16.279
BE FUNDED AND ESTABLISHED THEY

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:17.514
ALSO HAVE TO STRETCH THOSE

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:19.616
RESOURCES OVER A FOUR YEAR

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.618
PERIOD THIS REALLY HAS TO DO

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.187
MORE WITH THE AMOUNT OF

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.856
RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE.

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:28.692
RATHER THAN- INTEREST IN THESE

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.493
TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:32.162
PARTICULARLY IN AREAS STAND.

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:33.663
BECAUSE THERE IS AN INDUSTRY

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.233
PARTNER COMPONENT. IT IS FAR

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:38.235
MORE INVOLVED THAN OTHER AND

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.570
DUAL ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS- BUT WE

00:50:40.637 --> 00:50:41.905

PARTICULARLY. FOR DIVERSE

00:50:46.243 --> 00:50:48.111
STUDENT GROUPS. SO IS THAT TO

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:50.247
UNDERSTAND ASIDE FROM THE ONE

00:50:50.313 --> 00:50:52.315
TIME FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE FOR

THERE MAY BE MORE INTEREST AND

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.298

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.742
EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES THROUGH

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.010
WHICH THEY CAN FIND ADDITIONAL

00:58:34.077 --> 00:58:36.246
LITERACY COACHES MOST NOTABLY AT

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:37.447
THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:40.083
FORMULA AND SEE HOW FAST. THE

TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.885

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:52.662
COACHES. THIS AUGMENTATION AND

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.230
IT WOULD BE TARGETED MANY OF THE

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.498
DISTRICTS THAT WOULD RECEIVE

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.299
FUNDING UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:57.867
PROPOSAL. WE THINK THE

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.435
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF

00:58:59.502 --> 00:59:01.004
PROVIDING RESTRICTED FUNDING FOR

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.538
CERNER DEAL EARLY LITERACY

00:59:02.605 --> 00:59:04.240
ACTIVITIES IS NOT CONSISTENT

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:05.208
WITH THE REGIONAL LEGISLATIVE

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:08.411
INTENT ALLEYS LOCALLY FUND AND-

00:59:08.478 --> 00:59:10.346
DETERMINE. PRIORITIES UNDER LCS

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:12.448
FAST. STUDY SUGGESTS THAT

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:13.917
LITERACY COACHING CAN'T IMPROVE

00:59:13.983 --> 00:59:15.652
STUDENT READING TEST SCORES IF

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:17.687
EXPERIENCED COACHES ARE PLACED

00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.322
IN THE LOWEST PERFORMING SCHOOLS

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:21.257
FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. HOWEVER

00:59:21.324 --> 00:59:23.459
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL DOES NOT

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:24.961
ALIGN WITH THE RESEARCH IN THREE

00:59:25.028 --> 00:59:27.697
KEY ASPECTS. FIRST THE PROPOSAL

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:28.698
IS NOT TARGETED TO THE LOWEST

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.433
PERFORMING SCHOOLS AS INDICATED

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.768
UNDER THE STATE SCHOOL

00:59:31.834 --> 00:59:33.703
ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. INSTEAD

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.904
THE PROPOSAL TARGETS FINDING

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:36.773
BASED ON STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS.

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:38.841
SECOND TEMPORARY FUNDING COULD

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:40.443
LIMIT THE PROPOSAL'S IMPACT.

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.711
GOVERNOR'S RECALLS A WOULD ONLY

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.880
PROVIDE FUNDING OVER THREE YEARS

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.982
GIVEN THE TIME THAT IT TAKES.

00:59:46.049 --> 00:59:48.351
HIRE TRAIN AND PLAN FOR COACHING

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.286
COACHES MAY JUST BE STARTING TO

00:59:50.353 --> 00:59:51.354
BE EFFECTIVE AROUND THE TIME

00:59:51.421 --> 00:59:52.822
THAT FUNDING WOULD EXPIRE.

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:54.824
ADDITIONALLY THE PROPOSED

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.025
LEGISLATION WOULD NOT PROHIBIT

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.427
SCHOOLS FROM USING THIS TO

00:59:57.493 --> 00:59:58.795
SUPPLANT EXISTING FUNDING FOR

00:59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.763
COACHES ALSO LIMITING THE IMPACT

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.732
OF THIS PROPOSAL. LAST WEEK

01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:04.667
CURRENT STAFFING SHORTAGES COULD

01:00:04.734 --> 01:00:06.436
RESULT IN MANY AN EXPERIENCED

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:08.604
COACHES BEING HIRED. WE KNOW

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:10.106
THAT MANY DISTRICTS ARE FACING

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:11.474
WIDESPREAD STAFFING SHORTAGES

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:18.348
INCLUDING. FOR LITERACY COACH

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:19.282
POSITIONS AFFECT LITERACY TO

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.117

INTO. AND EXPIRY WORKING WITH

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.356
EACH. SUCH CALL LITERACY COACHES

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:28.458
COULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND IN

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.159
THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ALTHOUGH THE

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:31.060
ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.495
ADDRESS THE STAFFING LIMITATIONS

01:00:32.562 --> 01:00:33.596
THROUGH THE PROPOSED TWENTY FIVE

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.098
MILLION FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING

01:00:35.164 --> 01:00:36.265
IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SUCH

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.233
TRAINING QUITE EFFECTIVELY

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.835
BRIDGE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP.

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:39.836
ACTUALLY SINCE THE TRAINING

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:41.704
MIGHT NOT BE TAILORED FOR EACH

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:42.605
SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THESE REASONS

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:44.507
WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:46.109
REJECTED THE PROPOSED FUNDING

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.844

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:57.052
BECAUSE IT'S A NEED. THE REAL

01:15:57.119 --> 01:16:02.424

ABOUT- TEACHING TO PUT THAT ON

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:31.912
THE RADAR AND TO. TO MAKE SURE

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.833
INVESTMENT THAT'S BEING PROPOSED

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.602
AS THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:42.803
DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:45.973
OUTREACH. TO HELP. TO AMPLIFY

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:47.908
REALLY THE WORK THAT THE

01:40:47.975 --> 01:40:49.843
COMMISSION INTENDS TO DO WITH

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.678

AROUND WHY TEACH. ONE OF THE

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:08.462
THINGS WE ABOUT ON. SYSTEM TRIP

01:41:08.529 --> 01:41:09.730
MANY MANY MAY TV PEOPLE ARE

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:10.864
COMPLETE COLLEGE LOOKING FOR

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.866
WHAT CAN I DO TO CONTRIBUTE- AND

01:41:12.933 --> 01:41:14.768
THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:16.537
IMPORTANT REASONS PEOPLE ELECT

01:41:16.603 --> 01:41:18.238

AMPLIFY THAT AND COORDINATE OUR

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:24.411
EFFORTS TO REACH OUT AND GET

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:26.814
THAT. WE DO HAVE INFORMATION AS

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.283
TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION. OUR IN

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:31.852
OUR DATA SETS I THINK THIS IS

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.320
PRIMARILY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:35.823
EDUCATION WHERE THE HIGHEST-

01:41:35.889 --> 01:41:37.057
MAKE THE COUNTIES WITH THE

01:41:37.124 --> 01:41:38.859
LARGEST DEMAND AND FORTY

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:40.828
TEACHERS EVERY YEAR WE GET A

01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:41.795
REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:41:41.862 --> 01:41:43.697
EDUCATION THAT. PROJECTS

01:41:43.764 --> 01:41:45.666
EXPECTED HIRES FOR THE COMING

01:41:45.732 --> 01:41:48.335
YEAR AND THAT- THERE ARE TOP TEN

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:51.038
COUNTIES OF DEBT THAT ARE LISTED

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:52.272
IN THAT IN THAT DATA AND ON OUR

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:53.941
DASHBOARD YOU'D BE HAPPY TO

01:41:54.007 --> 01:41:55.409

INFORMATION NOW. AT A LATER DATE

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:01.381
. I THINK IF. DOES THAT POINT

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:03.183
YOUR QUESTION. THEN I HAVE A

01:42:03.250 --> 01:42:06.420
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- HERE AND

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:08.789
FIRST IS FOR THE COMMISSION ON

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:14.061
TEACHER CREDENTIALING- WE LAST

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.563
YEAR BOUGHT IN THESE HEARINGS

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:20.868
ASKED ABOUT. OUR TEACHER SUPPLY

01:42:20.934 --> 01:42:22.836
AND THERE WAS A LAG IN

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:25.639
STATISTICS AND SO WE COULDN'T

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:28.275
UNDERSTAND THAT HOW THE PANDEMIC

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:30.244
HAD AFFECTED TEACHER SUPPLY AND

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.379
I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS IN YOUR

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:34.515
PRESENTATION AND THEY WERE IN

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:39.920
MANY WAYS- SPEAKING TO HOW. ARE

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.288
SOME TIME PERIODS ADMIN

01:42:41.355 --> 01:42:42.956
SHORTENED HER THINGS HAD BEEN

01:42:43.023 --> 01:42:44.992
HAPPENED TO MOVE PEOPLE LAND BUT

01:42:45.058 --> 01:42:46.560
IF YOU STAND BACK AND LOOK AT

01:42:46.627 --> 01:42:48.695
THE GLOBAL ISSUE OF TEACHER

01:42:48.762 --> 01:42:50.964
SUPPLY HOW COULD YOU EXPLAIN

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:53.000
THOSE STATISTICS AND WHAT IT

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:56.803
TELLS US IS THERE STILL. A

01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:59.206
SHORTAGE PEOPLE COMING INTO THAT

01:42:59.273 --> 01:43:00.407
EXPEDITE PEOPLE BUT DIDN'T

01:43:00.474 --> 01:43:02.809
ADDRESS SOME BASIC SHORTAGE

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:06.547
ISSUES COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT

01:43:06.613 --> 01:43:09.149
. SURE SO WHEN IT WHEN TWO YEARS

01:43:09.216 --> 01:43:11.552
AGO WHEN WE CLOSED EVERYTHING

01:43:11.618 --> 01:43:14.621
DOWN. IN THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:17.658
COVERT NINETEEN OF WE RAN INTO

01:43:17.724 --> 01:43:19.192
AN IMMEDIATE PROBLEM ND I THINK

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:20.928
WE DISCUSSED THIS PERHAPS LAST

01:43:20.994 --> 01:43:22.696
YEAR AT A BUDGET HEARING AS WELL

01:43:22.763 --> 01:43:23.931
BUT THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM WAS

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:25.899
THAT WE DID WAS TESTING OF ALL

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:28.502
THINGS. THAT WE COULD NOT

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:30.370
EITHER- ALLOW THE COHORT OF

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:31.872
TEACHERS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:33.941
TEACHER PREPARATION TO COMPLETE

01:43:34.007 --> 01:43:35.609
THEIR PREPARATION AS OF MARCH OF

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:36.710
LAST YEAR THEY COULDN'T GET

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:38.545
ACCESS TO TESTING CENTERS TO

01:43:38.612 --> 01:43:40.347
TAKE THEIR FINAL EXAMINATIONS-

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:41.615
IF THEY COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:42.816
CLASSROOMS TO COMPLETE THEIR

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:44.518
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS- STUDENT

01:43:44.585 --> 01:43:46.920
TEACHING. OPPORTUNITIES SO THE

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.989
WORK FOR SERVICE IN PREPARATION

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:50.524
AND ABOUT TO BE CREDENTIAL WAS

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:53.060
STUCK. AND ANYONE WHO IS SEEKING

01:43:53.126 --> 01:43:55.996
TO APPLY FOR ENTRY INTO TEACHER

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:57.197
PREPARATION AT THAT TIME WAS

01:43:57.264 --> 01:43:58.432
ALSO STRUCK BECAUSE THEY

01:43:58.498 --> 01:43:59.232
COULDN'T TAKE ENTRANCE

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:00.801
EXAMINATIONS THE BASIC SKILLS

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:02.469
TEST WHERE THAT THE SUBJECT

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.204
MATTER TESTS. THE TESTING BECAME

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.807
THE BARRIER THAT THAT FROZE OUR

01:44:06.873 --> 01:44:08.475
PIPELINE RIGHT THEN AND THERE

01:44:08.542 --> 01:44:10.444
AND SO WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS I

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:11.678
WAS AND WE WORK WITH THE

01:44:11.745 --> 01:44:13.013
ADMINISTRATION WORK WITH THE

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.082
LEGISLATURE TO GET THIS DONE. OF

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.883
FIRST OFF WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:19.519
THAT REMOVED TESTING IS AN

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:20.821
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENT FOR

01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:22.522
PREPARATION. OF ALLOWING PEOPLE

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:24.691
TO ADD TO BE ADMITTED TO

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:25.292
PREPARATION WITH THE PROVISO

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.727
THAT THEY COMPLETE THEIR BASIC

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.061
SKILLS AND SUBJECT MATTER BEFORE

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.663
THEY GET THEIR CREDENTIAL BUT IT

01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:31.565
ALLOWED PEOPLE TO ENTER

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:37.337
PREPARATION. IN TWENTY OF

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:38.305
TWENTY- INTERN OF PEOPLE. PRINT

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:40.907
USING WORSE. ORDER ALSO ALLOWED

01:44:40.974 --> 01:44:43.276
. FOR I. T. TO. THEIR READING

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:44.645
INSTRUCTIONAL COMPETENCE

01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:45.779
ASSESSMENT WHICH THEY NEEDED

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:47.614
SAKE IN  TESTING CENTER. SO

01:44:47.681 --> 01:44:49.549
THEY CAN DEFERRED FOR UP TO FIVE

01:44:49.616 --> 01:44:51.084
YEARS GET THEIR PRELIMINARY

01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:53.153
CREDENTIAL AND BEGIN TEACHING. A

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.488
COMPLETE THAT WITHIN THE FIVE

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:56.490
YEARS THAT THEY NEEDED TO EARN

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.291
THEIR CLEAR TEACHING CREDENTIAL.

01:44:58.358 --> 01:44:59.660
SIMILARLY WITH THE TEACHING

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:00.927
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT WHICH

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.496
REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A

01:45:02.562 --> 01:45:04.564
CLASSROOM WHERE THEY CAN. THEY

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:06.166
CAN DO THE WORK THAT'S NECESSARY

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:07.768
TO ASSEMBLE THE MATERIALS FOR

01:45:07.834 --> 01:45:09.236
THAT PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT.

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:11.605
WITHOUT A CLASSROOM MANY WEAK

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:13.674
MANY INNOVATIONS EMERGED IN THAT

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.342
MOMENT WHERE WE LOOK AT HOW CAN

01:45:15.409 --> 01:45:17.144
ONLINE LEARNING SO YOU KNOW

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.512
SUBSTITUTE FOR IN CLASSROOM

01:45:18.578 --> 01:45:20.514
EXPERIENCE THAT WE LEARNED A LOT

01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:21.481
ABOUT THAT. BUT DEFERRING THOSE

01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:23.583
ASSESSMENTS ENABLE THAT

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.719
POPULATION TO GET IN. TWO OF THE

01:45:25.786 --> 01:45:27.554
TEACHING PROFESSION BE AVAILABLE

01:45:27.621 --> 01:45:30.724
AS EARLY AS THE TWENTY TWENTY

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.092
TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR- YES AS

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:33.694
TEACHERS. THESE WERE VERY

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.861
IMPORTANT SHIFTS HERE I

01:45:34.928 --> 01:45:36.730
APPRECIATE HOW IMPORTANT DOES

01:45:36.797 --> 01:45:38.498
WORK I'M STILL TRYING TO GET A

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:40.901
PICTURE OF WHAT THE GLOBAL

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:44.237
SITUATION IS. A. N. N. A. N. IF

01:45:44.304 --> 01:45:46.273
IT'S JUST AT THE DATA CAN'T TELL

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:48.308
YOU THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:51.111
KNOW BECAUSE- IF YOU JUST GOT

01:45:51.178 --> 01:45:52.546
ALL THIS RAW DATA THAT DOESN'T

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:56.783
GIVE YOU. ANY WAY TO BREAK DOWN.

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:58.218
THE HOUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:00.153
EXPEDITED HOW THEY WEREN'T A

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:03.857
PART. REALLY OVERALL. ARE WE

01:46:03.924 --> 01:46:07.060
SEEING. MORE RETIREMENTS THAN

01:46:07.127 --> 01:46:10.530
THERE ARE NEW TEACHERS IN. CAR

01:46:10.597 --> 01:46:11.865
AND IN ROME AT SHIFTING AND

01:46:11.932 --> 01:46:14.568
PLACES THAT THAT. DICTATES A

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:15.402
SHORTAGE I AM TRYING TO

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:17.337
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S THE

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:23.710
PERFECT BACKDROP. FOR THE

01:46:23.777 --> 01:46:24.644
DISCUSSION OF THIS ITEM. WELL

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:26.580
THE TEST I GUESS SINCE TEST IS A

01:46:26.646 --> 01:46:29.216
BARRIER. THAT AND SOME OF THE

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:31.084
CHANGE THAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR-

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:32.552
IN. ENABLING FLEX AROUND THIS

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:34.187
TESTING REQUIREMENTS SHOULD HELP

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:36.923
BUT THE FACT THAT- WE SAW A 15%

01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:38.992
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:39.760
TEACHING CREDENTIALS WE WERE

01:46:39.826 --> 01:46:42.729
ABLE THE ISSUE. IN THE TWENTY

01:46:42.796 --> 01:46:44.598
TWENTY ONE YEAR WHICH IS WHAT I

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:47.901
SHARED EARLIER- IT. SUGGESTIVE

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.503
ADDED ON ON UNDERSTANDING THE

01:46:49.569 --> 01:46:52.038
CONTEXT FOR THAT IS THAT A

01:46:52.105 --> 01:46:53.607
HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.108
PREVIOUS YEAR BECAUSE COVERED

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:57.377
REALLY DEPRESSED AT AND OVERALL

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:59.279
WE'RE STILL. REALLY HAVING A

01:46:59.346 --> 01:47:01.314
SHORTAGE AND NOT PROCESSING AS

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.550
MANY PEOPLE AS ROOF RETIRING I'M

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:05.685
TRYING TO LOOK FOR THE OVERALL

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:08.188
SHARON TAX. SO SUMMARY AND WHAT

01:47:08.255 --> 01:47:10.223
I WOULD SAY IS THAT THESE ARE IT

01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:11.525
REGARDING DECATUR'S AT THIS

01:47:11.591 --> 01:47:12.959
POINT INDICATORS THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:14.361
GO DEEPER AND WE NEED TO DO

01:47:14.427 --> 01:47:16.496
DEEPER WORK TO FIND OUT EXACTLY

01:47:16.563 --> 01:47:18.198
WHAT. WERE THE ROOT CAUSES THAT

01:47:18.265 --> 01:47:19.566
ENABLE MORE PEOPLE TO COME AND

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:21.768
GET CREDENTIALS THAN BEFORE WE

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.603
HAVE A STRONG SUSPICION THAT

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:25.739
LAMINATING TESTING. BARRIERS FOR

01:47:25.806 --> 01:47:28.642
ENTRY AND FOR EXIT. HELPED IN

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:30.944
THE AND GAVE US 15% MORE LAST

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:32.612
YEAR THAN WE THAN WE HAVE THE

01:47:32.679 --> 01:47:34.548
PRIOR YEAR- SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:47:34.614 --> 01:47:36.550
THE LEGISLATURE SEE I'M STILL

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:38.418
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.053
FOR THAT I THINK. I'M SORT OF

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:41.388
GATHERING I'M NOT GOING TO GET

01:47:41.454 --> 01:47:44.658
IT RIGHT NOW SO LET ME JUST MAKE

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:47.227
CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT THAT. WE

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.930
REALLY WANT TO KNOW IF THERE'S

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:52.299
THESE PROPOSALS FOR WAIVERS AND

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:56.336
OTHER THINGS. WHAT'S OUR OVERALL

01:47:56.403 --> 01:47:58.872
SITUATION OR MANY MORE TEACHERS

01:48:03.610 --> 01:48:06.112
HIGHER AND THE PROBLEM MADE MORE

01:48:06.179 --> 01:48:08.849
ACUTE BY THE PANDEMIC. ARE SO

01:48:08.915 --> 01:48:11.251
THAT WE KNOW THAT ONE WERE

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:15.155
ASKING BEING ASKED TO SUPPORT

01:48:15.222 --> 01:48:18.124
FINANCIAL WE- ARE THINGS THAT

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:20.794
EXPEDITE TEACHERS WERE CONVINCED

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:22.495
TEACHERS TO COME IN MIKE HAVE

01:48:22.562 --> 01:48:24.231
CHOSEN TEACHING OR WHATEVER IT

01:48:24.297 --> 01:48:26.466
IS THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THE

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:27.601
IMPACT AGAINST THE GLOBAL

01:48:27.667 --> 01:48:29.536
PROBLEM OF THE SENATE IF IT

01:48:29.603 --> 01:48:31.571
TURNS OUT. YOU DON'T KEEP THOSE

01:48:31.638 --> 01:48:32.906
TO STATISTICS IN THE RIGHT WAY

01:48:32.973 --> 01:48:34.608
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHO DOES

01:48:34.674 --> 01:48:36.676
OR HOW TO DISTILL THEM OR HOW TO

01:48:36.743 --> 01:48:38.311
GET THERE BUT THAT'S- THE THAT'S

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:40.547
THE I THINK THE ISSUE FOR US

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:43.350
WELL LET ME. GIVE YOU JUST ONE

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:45.552
MORE THING BEFORE YOU DO SENATOR

01:48:45.619 --> 01:48:46.953
THERE BUT IN TERMS OF

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:47.621
RETIREMENTS WE DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:50.190
DATA THAT CASTERS DOES LAST YEAR

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:53.660
THERE WAS A PROJECTED- NUMBER

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:54.194
SIXTEEN THOUSAND POSSIBLE

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:56.196
RETIREMENTS THIS TIME LAST YEAR

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:58.098
WE ACTUALLY SAW BASED ON CASTERS

01:48:58.164 --> 01:49:03.069
DATA ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND

01:49:03.136 --> 01:49:03.703
FIVE HUNDRED. TEACHERS WE WE'VE

01:49:03.770 --> 01:49:08.708
SEEN- WE'RE SEEING- OF HOLES IN

01:49:08.775 --> 01:49:10.610
OF THE TEACHING POPULATION HOW

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:11.811
MANY OF YOU ARE TEACHERS ARE

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:13.413
PLANNING TO STAY. OR LEAVE THE

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.148
PROFESSION AND THOSE NUMBERS

01:49:15.215 --> 01:49:18.184
DURING THIS YEAR OF RE OPENING

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.352
SCHOOLS- ARE ARE ALL OVER THE

01:49:19.419 --> 01:49:21.488
PLACE IT COULD BE AS MANY AS 21%

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.356
OF THE TEACHERS AT THE TIME THAT

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:24.791
THEY WERE SURVEYED SAID I DON'T

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.559
KNOW THAT I CAN STAND THIS FOR

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:28.428
ANOTHER YEAR. BUT THIS YEAR HAS

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:29.362
BEEN VOLATILE IN THAT RESPECT

01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:30.597
AND YOU NEVER RESPECT SO THE

01:49:30.664 --> 01:49:32.565
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SIR THAT'S

01:49:32.632 --> 01:49:35.735
ALL WE DON'T KNOW OKAY. THAT'S

01:49:35.802 --> 01:49:37.404
HAPPENING. JOHNSON WITH THE

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:40.774
STATUS THIS YEAR TO. AS HE IS-

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.742
WON ME ARE THEM BE TO THE

01:49:42.809 --> 01:49:45.178
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND EVEN IF

01:49:45.245 --> 01:49:48.181
YOU'RE NOT READY NOW US SINCE

01:49:48.248 --> 01:49:50.283
THE CREDENTIALING ONLY HAS PART

01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:52.752
OF THE ISSUE IT'S PEOPLE COMING

01:49:52.819 --> 01:49:54.054
IN OR OR STOPPING WITH

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.455
CREDENTIALS AND THERE'S NOT THE

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.123
RETIREMENT INFORMATION DO YOU

01:49:57.190 --> 01:49:58.858
MONITOR THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:00.860
TOWARD THIS QUESTION OF WHERE WE

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:04.798
ARE. ON TEACHER SUPPLY. THANK

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:05.665
YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATE

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:07.534
EARLIER IT'S I THINK THIS IS- A

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:08.969
QUINTESSENTIAL QUESTION WHEN IT

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:10.804
COMES TO TEACHING ISSUES TRYING

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:13.039
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S- THE

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.040
TEACHER SUPPLY LOOKS LIKE

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:15.675
COMPARED TO THE DEMANDS I DON'T

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:17.644
THINK JUST GIVEN THE AVAILABLE

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:19.245
TO SEE DATA WE'VE EVER HAD A

01:50:19.312 --> 01:50:20.780
GOOD GRASP OF THAT INFORMATION.

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:21.982
AND WE USUALLY DO LOOK AT

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:24.985
INDICATORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:26.820
EMERGENCY- WAIVERS AND PRETEND

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:28.755
AND- AND URGENCY CREDENTIALS ARE

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:30.423
ISSUED FROM YEAR TO YEAR WE CAN

01:50:30.490 --> 01:50:32.325
USUALLY LOOK ADDS- HOW OLD DAY

01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:33.593
NUMBER OF NEWLY ISSUED

01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:34.561
CREDENTIALS COMPARES TO THE

01:50:34.627 --> 01:50:36.629
PROJECTED. NUMBER OF ESTIMATED

01:50:36.696 --> 01:50:37.364
HIGHER IS THAT DISTRICTS ARE

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:39.699
ASKING FOR ANY YEAR TO YEAR

01:50:39.766 --> 01:50:41.468
BASIS- BUT WE DON'T WE DON'T

01:50:41.534 --> 01:50:43.536
TYPICALLY HAVE AN EASY GO TO

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:45.472
WHEN IT COMES TO ASSESSING WHAT

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:46.773
AND I TEACHER SHORTAGES LOOK

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.142
LIKE OR WHETHER OR NOT. THERE IS

01:50:49.209 --> 01:50:49.709
A TEACHER SHORTAGE OR AN

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:52.178
OVERSUPPLY AND I THINK PART OF

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:53.179
THAT ADDITIONAL COMPLICATION

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:56.049
WITH. DATA RECENT YEARS IS JUST

01:50:56.116 --> 01:50:58.284
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND NOT

01:50:58.351 --> 01:50:59.919
KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.421
IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC WILL BE

01:51:01.488 --> 01:51:03.356
SHORT LASTING OR LONG LASTING I

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:04.824
THINK THEY'RE THEY'RE CHALLENGES

01:51:04.891 --> 01:51:06.693
THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO IT THE

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.494
AVAILABILITY OF DATA. BUT

01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:09.596
THEY'RE ALSO ISSUES THAT ARE

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:12.432
RELATED TO- SORT OF THAT THE

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:14.300
VERY SPECIFIC AS CHANGING COULD

01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:16.102
NATURE OF THE PANDEMIC RIGHT NOW

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:17.604
THAT I THINK MAKES IT REALLY

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.738
HARD TO UNDERSTAND FROM A GLOBAL

01:51:18.805 --> 01:51:21.608
CONTACTS WHETHER OR NOT.

01:51:21.674 --> 01:51:23.243
DISTRICTS HAVE ACCESS TO. FULLY

01:51:23.309 --> 01:51:24.411
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS THAT THEY

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:26.513
NEED TO FOR THE CLASSROOMS.

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:28.314
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND

01:51:28.381 --> 01:51:29.849

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:42.054
WHAT IS BEING ADDED AND WHAT IS

02:07:42.121 --> 02:07:44.089
BIG TARGETED FOR THE ADDITIONS

02:07:44.156 --> 02:07:45.758
SO THAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

SERIES I KNOW COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:08:06.478 --> 02:08:08.280
ARE BETTER POSITIONED TO DO THAT

02:08:08.347 --> 02:08:10.616
SO I'M TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.751
WHAT'S DONE NOW WHAT WITH THIS

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:15.487

RECEIVES- SIX HUNDRED MILLION

02:08:36.809 --> 02:08:38.911
DOLLARS- AND THEN THIS

02:08:38.977 --> 02:08:40.846
INVESTMENT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL

02:08:40.913 --> 02:08:41.580
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

02:08:41.647 --> 02:08:44.683
DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT- SO THE

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:46.452

02:14:48.313 --> 02:14:50.115
