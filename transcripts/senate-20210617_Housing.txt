B. FOUR EIGHTY TWO BY CENTER BY CAL SKI HI JOHN I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WANT TO THANK -- THE OPPOSITION ALSO FOR ENGAGING -- AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BUILDING TRADES AND WITH THE AUTHOR -- AND WITH OTHERS AND MY APPROACH IN THIS COMMITTEE SUPPORTER OF SKILLED WORK FORCE AND AND PROBABLY MY BIGGEST HOUSING BILL EVER AUTHORED SB THIRTY FIVE INCLUDES A SKILLED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS -- WE ARE I I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE TO A POINT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS DONE BY A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A SUPPORTER OF IN SAM WHEN I WAS IN POOR SUPERVISORS PL A WE HAVE A CITY WIDE DE LA AND -- SERVICES CO WHICH I SUPPORTED OF IT HAD I NOT LAST BEFORE TO COME TO THE SENATE BEFORE IT GOT DONE -- AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION SO THAT ARE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE ABLE TO BE PART OF THE MIDDLE CLASS -- SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMMUTE THREE HOURS TO GO TO WORK -- AND SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE HOUSING THAT THEY ARE THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD NOW -- IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE OF THAT AND WHAT IT MEANS THERE IS A LOT OF CONFLICT AROUND THE NOW AND AS I I SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD AND GET THE SAME QUOTE TO THE PRESS EVERY TIME I'M CALLED THAT WE NEED TO GET THIS RESOLVED HAVE THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE TO GET A RESULT HAVING DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE BY THE GOVERNOR ON AND JUST GET THIS DONE SO WE CAN TRANSITION AND REALLY SCALE UP OUR SKILLED WORKFORCE DRAMATICALLY EXPAND THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING BUILT ALL REASONS THAT MEANS HAVING APPRENTICES AND AND THIRTY PEOPLE EVERYWHERE NOT JUST IN THE BAY AREA RAMPING IT UP EVERYWHERE IN THE STATE SKILLED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED MORE AND MORE BECAUSE WE NEED TO BUILD MILLIONS OF HOMES AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE BEING PAID WELL -- AND COULDN'T LIVE IN THOSE HOMES SELLING THE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION -- -- YOU WERE HAVING THESE FIGHTS ARE BILL BY BILL NOW -- AND I'VE TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THE AUTHORS DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT TO HAVE SKILLED WORK FORCE COMMITTEE WITH SOME WITHOUT ON AND I DON'T AS CHAIR FORCE THEM TO TAKE IT OUT OR PUT IT IN -- BUT I WILL REITERATE CAN THAT WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE -- AND AND AND AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO RAMP UP OUR SKILLED WORKFORCE -- AND DO IT COLLECTIVELY SO -- WITHOUT ALL THE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS IN CONTINUAL CONVERSATIONS BACK IN HIS HOMETOWN AND STATEWIDE AND I I TRUST THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE YOU CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL I THOUGHT SO MY APOLOGIES ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE CLOSE I THINK I DID MY CLOTHES BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU AND I REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE COMMENTS AS WE SENATOR AMBER YES OF COURSE I HAVE HAD SEVERAL MEETINGS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MEET WITH ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN ANY OF MY BILLS -- BUT I TO HAVE BEEN A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT OUR OUR HOUSING DOES NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE PREVAILING WAGES AND HAVE APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS HOWEVER THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS ABOUT CREATING THE MUCH NEEDED MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING OUR STATE NEEDS BY EXTENDING A VEHICLE TO ACQUIRE INDEED RESTRICT PROPERTY SUCH AS THE HILLCREST IN SO WITHOUT THE AUTHORITY TO FINANCES MIDDLE INCOME PROJECT THE SAN DIEGO HOUSING COMMISSION COULD NOT ACQUIRED THE ALREADY CONSTRUCTED PROPERTY OF FORTY SEVEN UNITS TWELVE OF WHICH ARE PERMISSIBLE ORDER HOUSING NOW HOUSING HOLD PREVIOUSLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN MY DISTRICT ALTHOUGH THAT I ACTUALLY TOOK ON THE SAN DIEGO CITY COUNCIL WITH NO OPPOSITION FROM THE BUILDING TRADES OR OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS SO WE DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONSTRUCT FOR HOUSING IN OUR STATE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A MEMBER OF THIS OF THIS COMMITTEE IN THE FUTURE BUT WE NEED TO PRESERVE THE HOUSING STOCK THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN TO IN SHRINE AFFORDABILITY FOR DECADES TO COME THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT AND THE REASON THAT I'VE COME IN I'VE STUDIED THIS CLOSELY AND WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD TO COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY HERE FINANCING HERE THIS IS ABOUT EXTENDING A SUNSET I KNOW THERE ARE NO EASY BILLS -- IN EITHER OF OUR HOUSES SOMETIMES YOU KNOW THERE'S NEW PERSPECTIVES THAT COME TO LIGHT THIS IS EXTENDING AN EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM TO TEST THE THEORY OF WHETHER OR NOT EXISTING AFFORDABILITY MECHANISMS FOR THE PURCHASING ACQUISITION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXTEND TO THE MIDDLE INCOME RANGE WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ALLOWED FOR THE LOW INCOME RANGE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LET THESE SERVICES IN SECOND TEST THAT QUESTION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ON ANOTHER TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX FOR THE PROVISION OF MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT IS NOT RESPECTFULLY IN THE OPPOSITION'S LOTTERY BEGINS AT THIS LEGISLATION WOULD PROVIDE PUBLIC FINANCING TO DEVELOPING FINANCING HOUSING PROJECTS EXCEPT IT DOESN'T DO THAT AND WE KNOW IT DOESN'T DO THAT BECAUSE BOTH OF OUR HOUSES OF KEY THIS NON FISCAL THERE IS NO NEW PUBLIC FINANCING HERE AND SO FOR ME THE REST OF THE CONVERSATION THEN IS UNSUBSTANTIATED AND WHILE I WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT NEW CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS NEW PUBLIC INVESTMENTS THAT DO HAVE A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE REQUIREMENTS I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS APPLICABLE IN THIS BILL I WOULD WELCOME OTHER SENATORS ODD COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS ON THIS IS THIS IF THIS WERE TO APPROACH THE SENATE FLOOR -- BUT AT THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR HONOR I THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND SORRY FOR ALMOST SKIPPING OVER CLOSE -- WITH THAT BENEFIT SUBSTANTIVE WOULD YOU PLEASE OUR STATE THE MOTION AND CALL
