PEARL HARBOR.

WAS WORKING AT THE U. S. STILL

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:28.884 region:rollup2

01:26:34.423 --> 01:26:38.393 region:rollup2
BODY ARE TO TORRANCE CALIFORNIA

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:41.430 region:rollup2
AT THE AGE YOUR OF UP I WAS

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:43.031 region:rollup2

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:43.665 region:rollup2
BUT I WAS VALUE OF EDUCATION SO

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:45.767 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS FOCUS ON

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:46.134 region:rollup2
EDUCATION BUT WHEN I FILL OUT A

01:26:45.767 --> 01:26:48.336 region:rollup2

YOU'RE A MEXICAN AMERICAN AND MY

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:53.341 region:rollup2

AND I THINK IT'S IT TRUST YOU

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.852 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY OF A PICTURE

01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:06.154 region:rollup2

01:27:03.852 --> 01:27:07.689 region:rollup2

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:09.925 region:rollup2
THIS PICTURE IN HIS UNIFORM WAS

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:11.426 region:rollup2
A FLAG OF MEXICO AND THE FLAG OF

01:27:09.925 --> 01:27:12.761 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:15.797 region:rollup2
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE GAVE

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:17.232 region:rollup2
HIS GRANDMOTHER.

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:17.799 region:rollup2
THAT'S COMPLEX BUT THAT'S

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:20.469 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHAT OUR HISTORIES

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:22.471 region:rollup2

01:32:01.316 --> 01:32:04.452 region:rollup2
THE VALUE WAITING WHERE WE ARE

01:32:03.585 --> 01:32:06.121 region:rollup2
WHERE WE'VE BEEN AND WHERE WE

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.021 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO.

01:32:06.121 --> 01:32:08.656 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY

01:32:07.021 --> 01:32:10.392 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:11.626 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENED FIFTY YEARS AGO.

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:13.495 region:rollup2
HOW OUR STUDENTS ROSE UP TO

01:32:11.626 --> 01:32:15.163 region:rollup2
PROTEST?

01:32:13.495 --> 01:32:16.064 region:rollup2
AND I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS I WAS

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:17.632 region:rollup2
AT THE UNIVERSITY ACTUALLY FIFTY

01:32:16.064 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

01:32:17.632 --> 01:32:20.902 region:rollup2
AND I REMEMBER ALL THE PROTESTS

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:23.038 region:rollup2
THAT TOOK PLACE AND HOW HOW

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:25.840 region:rollup2
VALUABLE THOSE PROTESTS WORRY Y.

01:32:23.038 --> 01:32:27.475 region:rollup2
IN CENTER RING US AS A NATION.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.676 region:rollup2
AND MAKING US AND REMINDING US

01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:29.944 region:rollup2
OF THE CONTINUING STRUGGLE TO

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:31.546 region:rollup2
WHAT TO BECOME THE MORE PERFECT

01:32:29.944 --> 01:32:33.181 region:rollup2
UNION.

01:32:31.546 --> 01:32:35.016 region:rollup2
THE NEVER REACH PERFECTION BUT

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:36.484 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WORKING TO BECOME THE

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:37.385 region:rollup2
MORE PERFECT UNION BECAUSE WHY

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:39.120 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE HUMAN.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:40.655 region:rollup2
AND WE MAKE MISTAKES

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.157 region:rollup2
AND WE OFTENTIMES DON'T SEE

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:43.992 region:rollup2
OTHERS WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE US

01:32:42.157 --> 01:32:45.093 region:rollup2
AND DON'T STRUGGLE LIKE US.

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:46.494 region:rollup2
AND AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT

01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:48.296 region:rollup2
BEEN WHO MUST BRING US BACK TO

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:50.732 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE.

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:52.200 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES WE HAVE LEAD THE

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:53.234 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THAT'S HERE IN THE END

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:54.235 region:rollup2
THEY THAT THAT NIGHT IN FIFTY

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:55.737 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THEY OFFER THAT

01:32:54.235 --> 01:32:57.272 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE.

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:59.040 region:rollup2
AND THEY SPARKED OFTENTIMES A

01:32:57.272 --> 01:33:01.376 region:rollup2
VOICE FOR SO MANY OTHERS IN

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:02.510 region:rollup2
SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT WE

01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:04.112 region:rollup2
FOUND THE PROTEST AT THE

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:05.914 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITIES AND WE FOUND BLACK

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:07.182 region:rollup2
STUDIES IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE.

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:09.250 region:rollup2
AND SIXTY EIGHT THOSE PROTESTS

01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:10.752 region:rollup2
WERE GOING ON OUR STUDENTS WERE

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:11.986 region:rollup2
RISING UP EVERYWHERE.

01:33:10.752 --> 01:33:13.154 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS

01:33:11.986 --> 01:33:14.355 region:rollup2
IT WAS AN EXCITING TIME TO BE

01:33:13.154 --> 01:33:15.924 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:33:14.355 --> 01:33:17.959 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A CHANCE THE

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:19.594 region:rollup2
HAVE A VOICE AS A YOUNG PERSON.

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:20.862 region:rollup2
AND HAVE THAT VOICE HEARD AND

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:22.897 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT OUR STUDENTS ALSO

01:33:20.862 --> 01:33:24.299 region:rollup2
DID LAST WEEK. THEY HAD A VOICE

01:33:22.897 --> 01:33:26.334 region:rollup2
AND THEY WERE HEARD AND THEY

01:33:24.299 --> 01:33:27.268 region:rollup2
WILL CONTINUE TO BE HEARD AND

01:33:26.334 --> 01:33:28.736 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A VOICE AND AN

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.605 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THINGS THAT

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:32.240 region:rollup2
MANY OF US WOULD LOVE TO DO BUT

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:34.676 region:rollup2
ARE AFRAID TO DO WHY. BECAUSE WE

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:36.711 region:rollup2
HAVE MORTGAGES WE HAVE BILLS WE

01:33:34.676 --> 01:33:38.646 region:rollup2
HAVE RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS IS

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:39.514 region:rollup2
THE ONE TIME MOST FOLKS REALIZE

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.982 region:rollup2
IN THAT LIES WHEN I WAS A

01:33:39.514 --> 01:33:42.550 region:rollup2
STUDENT I WAS TOLD. THIS IS THE

01:33:40.982 --> 01:33:43.618 region:rollup2
ONE TIME YOU CAN REALLY REYES

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.886 region:rollup2
HILL.

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.855 region:rollup2
YOU CAN BE THE PERSON YOU WANNA

01:33:44.886 --> 01:33:48.389 region:rollup2
BE YOU CAN RAISE THE ISSUES AND

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:50.925 region:rollup2
THE OTHERS WHO ARE HESITANT WILL

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:52.360 region:rollup2
HEAR YOU AND THEY WILL RESPOND.

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:54.162 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE NOW FACED WITH FIFTY

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.663 region:rollup2
YEARS OF AN ASSESSMENT.

01:33:54.162 --> 01:33:57.031 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD GO AND WHILE WE

01:33:55.663 --> 01:33:58.867 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND HOW HORRIBLE IT WAS

01:33:57.031 --> 01:34:01.102 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST WE SEE THE PROGRESS

01:33:58.867 --> 01:34:02.403 region:rollup2
BEEN MADE BUT WE ALSO KNOW AS WE

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:04.706 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CURRENT REPORTS THAT

01:34:02.403 --> 01:34:06.341 region:rollup2
ARE OUT TODAY. THAT WE STILL

01:34:04.706 --> 01:34:07.575 region:rollup2
HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:09.410 region:rollup2
THEY JUST DID THE MAJORITY

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:11.446 region:rollup2
REPORT IN TERMS OF EDUCATION OF

01:34:09.410 --> 01:34:14.482 region:rollup2
LATINOS WE HAD BLACK MINDS

01:34:11.446 --> 01:34:15.817 region:rollup2
MATTER. IN ENDS IN AND A REPORT

01:34:14.482 --> 01:34:17.352 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT SAYS IS THAT WE

01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:19.587 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE IN THESE

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:21.756 region:rollup2
ISSUES AROUND EDUCATION AROUND

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:23.158 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE SHOULD NEVER

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:24.993 region:rollup2
FORGET THAT AND THIS IS A

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:26.828 region:rollup2
REMINDER OF THAT AND WHILE SOME

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:28.263 region:rollup2

01:34:26.828 --> 01:34:29.764 region:rollup2
