ABLE TO PAY THAT. RIGHT RIGHT.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:01.518

YOU RAMBLE ON SO I THINK IT'S A

00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.260
GOOD POINT THAT- I THINK IT IS

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:12.629
A GOOD POINT TO MAY WE MAYBE

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.464
WHAT WE COULD CONSIDER- MISTER

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:17.467

READ THE MAYBE AS PART OF THEIR

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.273
FEE THAT THEY PAY YEAH IT LOOKS

00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:24.274
LIKE MAYBE THAT MIGHT BE

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:25.442
SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING AT.

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:26.510
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THAT

00:47:26.577 --> 00:47:27.678
BUT IF YOU JUST WANT TO REMIND

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.880
YOU AND PRIVACY COMMITTEE- WE

00:47:29.947 --> 00:47:32.449

ALL OF THAT THEY MAY NOT AGREE

00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:36.787
WITH IT BUT WE DID MAKE IT- I

00:47:36.853 --> 00:47:38.522
AFTER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.390
THAT EFFORT BECAUSE THIS. THIS

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:41.792
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT A DRUNK

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:43.794
DRIVER WHO WOULD BE NEGLIGENT.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.295

LANGUAGE INCLUDING THIS BILL

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.431
WOULD MEAN TO COMPANIES WOULD

00:47:47.497 --> 00:47:48.966
NOT BE LIABLE FOR AN

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:50.567
INTOXICATED. DRIVER SIDE AND

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:51.969
TALKED AT KßT RABBIT SO

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.270
THAT'S THAT'S A BLACK POINTER

00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:55.405
WORST CASE SCENARIOS. SO WE ARE

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.373
GOING TO WORK REAL HARD TO MAKE

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.576
SURE. WHOEVER IS LIABLE IT

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:04.147
STAYS HERE. BUT AS YOU KNOW- IT

00:48:04.214 --> 00:48:05.849
REALLY CAN'T STOP SOMEONE FROM

00:48:05.916 --> 00:48:07.618
CORPORATE DEPARTMENTS WHICH IS

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:08.485
WHY I THINK HE'S THINKING OF A

00:48:08.552 --> 00:48:09.853
WITH THE WITH THE LAWYERS

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.622
AGAIN. I'M NOT A LAWYER SO.

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:12.589
PRACTICING LAW WITHOUT A

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.591

THEY MAY STILL. YOU KNOW THAT

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:20.964
YOU CAN'T STOP SOMEONE FROM

00:48:21.031 --> 00:48:22.199
SUING WOULD PUT THE INTENDED

00:48:22.266 --> 00:48:23.667
THIS BILL. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.235

RIGHT WELL I MEAN. MY POINT IS

00:48:36.413 --> 00:48:36.947
I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.682
THIS. WE ASSUME AS POSSIBLE TO

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.983
WHAT OTHER INDUSTRIES ARE DOING

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.885
SO RENTAL CARS AS MAY BE A GOOD

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.620

THINK SHOULD BE IN THERE AS

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:24.521
WELL IF IT'S NOT ALREADY-

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:25.222
BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.556
DIFFERENT METHODS THAT YOU CAN

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:27.557
DO THAT ARE DANGEROUS OUT

00:50:27.624 --> 00:50:29.926
THERE. SO AT THIS POINT RIGHT

00:50:29.993 --> 00:50:31.995
NOW- I WOULD SUPPORT IT BUT

00:50:32.062 --> 00:50:33.463

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:36.466
MAKE THIS- FAIR ACROSS THE

00:50:36.533 --> 00:50:38.969
TABLE. AT NIGHT I COMMIT TO

00:50:39.035 --> 00:50:40.604

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.272
THE OTHER SIDE THEIR THEIR-

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:43.240
THEIR LOBBYISTS HAVE BEEN VERY

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:44.708
UNDERSTANDING HAVE COME MADE

00:50:44.775 --> 00:50:46.643
THAT COMMITMENT TO. TO GIVE

00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:48.145
THAT INFORMATION TO THE OTHER

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:51.148
SIDE- BUT THEY'VE BEEN. REAL'S

00:50:51.214 --> 00:50:54.217
CANNOT STUCK IN NOT WANTING TO

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:55.786
WORK WITH US IT'S NOT THE

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:56.486
INSURANCE COMPANIES TO THE

INSURANCE COMPANIES. WILL MAKE

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.924
MONEY AND THEY WILL FIGURE OUT

00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:03.560
A WAY- TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:05.162
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IT'S

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:07.330
EQUITABLE I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WE

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:08.432
PROBABLY COULD COME UP WITH

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.766
SOME ANSWER WITH THE INSURANCE

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:12.469
COMPANIES- IT'S JUST A WEEK WE

00:51:12.536 --> 00:51:14.971
NEED TO HELP FROM THE INDUSTRY.

00:51:15.038 --> 00:51:15.906
TO MAKE THIS SO THAT THEY FEEL

00:51:15.972 --> 00:51:22.579
COMFORTABLE. AND. WE NEED TO

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:23.180
GET THEM THERE BUT- THAT THEY

00:51:23.246 --> 00:51:24.581
DON'T WANT THIS AT ALL. WELCOME

00:51:24.648 --> 00:51:25.949
EVERYONE CAN COME THE TABLE. M.

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:26.950
AND MAKE THIS A- POLICY. THANK

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:29.686
YOU THE- ANOTHER COMMENTS FROM

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.621
THE COMMITTEE. MR JONES SAWYER

00:51:31.688 --> 00:51:34.858
I APPRECIATE THIS AND I THINK.

00:51:34.925 --> 00:51:36.193
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN YOU'VE

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.494
TAKEN AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS

00:51:37.561 --> 00:51:40.831
CONCERNS. BUT THOSE CONCERNS

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:43.066
ARE STILL ARTICULATED BUT

00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:45.001
WITHOUT ANY HELP. FROM THE

00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:47.037
INDUSTRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES

00:51:47.103 --> 00:51:48.572
AND FRANKLY WE WE'VE HEARD THIS

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:49.539
WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE SCENARIO

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.475
BEFORE NUMBER YEARS AGO WHEN WE

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:52.909
DEALT WITH LIFT AND UBER WHO

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.110
ARE SAYING OH MY GOSH YOU CAN'T

00:51:54.177 --> 00:51:56.413
MAKE US RESPONSIBLE. FOR OUR

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.349
DRIVERS AND THEY THEY CONTINUED

00:51:59.416 --> 00:51:59.883
TO PUT THAT BURDEN ON THE

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:03.253
DRIVER'S. AND WHAT ENDED UP

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:04.721
HAPPENING WAS IT WAS AN

00:52:04.788 --> 00:52:07.924
INSURANCE. POLICY QUESTION IN

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.659
THE END IN THE INSURANCE

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.061
INDUSTRY WAS VERY HAPPY TO

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.362
START TO WRITE POLICIES FOR

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.798
THAT SO THIS IS GOING TO

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:16.399
RESOLVE IN THAT WAY ANYWAY

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.235
WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE DRIVING AT.

00:52:18.301 --> 00:52:20.136
BUT THESE. DEVICES ARE VERY

00:52:20.203 --> 00:52:22.539
VERY DIFFERENT THAN CARS ME NOT

00:52:22.606 --> 00:52:24.541
JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY THE

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:25.542
TRAINING THE DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:27.277
ISSUES AT ALL BUT WALK AROUND

00:52:27.344 --> 00:52:29.980
TOWN HERE. I'M NOT WORRIED

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:31.147
ABOUT CARS DRIVING THE WRONG

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:33.083
WAY IN BIKE LANES IS I'M TRYING

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.151
TO CROSS A ONE WAY STREET. BUT

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:36.887
YOU SEE SCOOTERS DOING THAT.

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.455
ALL THE TIME THERE'S NO SENSE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:40.390
OF ACCOUNTABILITY THESE ARE FUN

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.259
THEY'RE INTERESTING. THEY'RE

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:44.728
WRITTEN. MORE FOR THE JOY OF

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:47.564
THEM THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OR

00:52:47.631 --> 00:52:49.232
JUST AS A TRANSPORTATION VOTE

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.567
AND YOU SEE FOLKS ON IDEWALKS

00:52:50.634 --> 00:52:52.435
AND BIKE LANES. GOING AGAINST

00:52:52.502 --> 00:52:54.304
TRAFFIC. AND THEN LEADING THEM

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:56.339
WHEREVER THEY WANT TO. SO THE

00:52:56.406 --> 00:52:58.942
ANSWER HAS TO BE THE COMPANY'S

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.444
HOLDING THEIR- CUSTOMERS

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:03.580
ACCOUNTABLE. AND SO YOU'RE

00:53:03.647 --> 00:53:05.715
APPROACH HERE IS REALLY TRYING

00:53:05.782 --> 00:53:08.251
TO DO THAT AND I'VE- APPLIED

00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.453
YOUR EFFORT. THE REASONS THAT

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:11.354
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS YES

00:53:11.421 --> 00:53:12.889
IT'S AN IRRITATION FOR THOSE OF

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.591
US WHO ARE CITED. BUT THOSE WHO

00:53:14.658 --> 00:53:16.393
ARE UNDECIDED IN WHEEL CHAIRS

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:19.863
AND STRUGGLING TO GET ALONG. ON

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:25.936
SIDEWALKS. WHERE EVER AND JUST

00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:27.237
WALKING HERE THE THREE BLOCKS

00:53:27.304 --> 00:53:28.338
AHEAD OF THE CAPITAL THERE WERE

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.006
ANY NUMBER OF THEM ALL OVER THE

00:53:30.073 --> 00:53:31.708
PLACE IS AN INAPPROPRIATELY.

00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:33.577
ALL OVER THE PLACE SO I THINK

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:35.412
THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS TO

00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:37.080
STEP UP HERE AND NOT JUST

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:38.915
COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS BUT IF THEY

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.150
WANT A DIFFERENT SOLUTION

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.885
PROPOSED A DIFFERENT SOLUTION.

00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:44.120
AND HELP YOU OUT SO THAT YOUR

00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:47.023
NAME CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED AND

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.426
NOT JUST BY THEM SAYING WE'LL

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:51.261
DO OUR BEST AND LOOK AT WHAT

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.762
WE'RE WORKING ON. BUT ACTUALLY

00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:55.131
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S WHAT

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:56.600
THIS BILL IS SO I APPRECIATE

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:58.068
YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I

00:53:58.134 --> 00:54:01.037

WHO NEED THE RELIEF FROM THE

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.682
PROLIFERATION OF THESE DEVICES.

DRIVEN EVERYWHERE THAT ARE

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:17.654
INAPPROPRIATE SO I THINK YOU'RE

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.322
ABSOLUTELY ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

00:54:19.389 --> 00:54:21.191

ALSO NEED TO- BUT TAKING

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:19.655
CONSIDERATION CASES THAT DO

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.523
HAPPEN WHERE WOMEN CLAIM TO BE

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.893
ON BIRTH CONTROL AND- AND MEN

ARE CONSENTING TO SEX UNDER

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.530
THOSE CONDITIONS AND THEN A

01:14:28.597 --> 01:14:30.566
WOMAN GETS PREGNANT. THERE'S NO

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:32.000

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.535
PREGNANCY AS A CONSEQUENCE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.204
MAKES JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS I

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:38.640
DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT- BUT

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.642
YOU KNOW THERE ARE. IT AND I'M

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.377
NOT SUGGESTING WOMEN TRY TO GET

I'M JUST BRINGING UP I DON'T

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.987

PREGNANCY- WELL THAT THAT MAKES

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:08.003
ME NERVOUS. I THINK- THE FRAUD

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.971
THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING IS

01:15:09.037 --> 01:15:10.739
IMPORTANT TO BE DISCUSSED AND

01:15:10.806 --> 01:15:11.907
SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AT SOME

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:13.508
POINT ANOTHER SOLUTION HERE AT

01:15:13.575 --> 01:15:15.510
THIS POINT BUT I DO THINK THAT.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:17.479
THIS DISCUSSION WORKS BOTH WAYS

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:19.047
AND CONSENT WORKS BOTH WAYS

01:15:19.114 --> 01:15:21.016
IT'S NOT JUST ONE OR THE OTHER-

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.819
AND- BUT THERE'S PREGNANCY OR

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.221
STDS. I DO THINK YOU BEING A

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.257
VALID POINT TO THE DISCUSSION

01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:29.491
THAT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT AROUND

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.594
CONSENT. AND NEEDS TO BE

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:34.096
EXPANDED OUT TO BOTH SIDES AND

01:15:34.162 --> 01:15:36.698
SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH SOME

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:37.966
OF THAT AND I THINK I THINK IT

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:38.800
SPEAKS TO THE WORK WE HAVE TO

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:41.470

NEED TO DISCUSS RIGHT I'M

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:48.911

01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:58.366
FOR VICTIMS TO KNOW THAT THEY

01:18:58.433 --> 01:19:00.936
CAN PURSUE DAMAGES- AND THIS

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.437
CASE AND I THINK WE'VE BEEN

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.807
FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE-

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.075
PREGNANCY SETTING AND INCLUDE

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:09.010

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:10.378
ABILITY TO BE COMPENSATED FOR

BOTH MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT ARE

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.249
PHYSICAL BUT ALSO MENTAL. AS

01:19:14.316 --> 01:19:16.084
WELL THAT THAT GO WITH THAT

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:17.786
ALONG THE WAY AND I THINK

01:19:17.853 --> 01:19:19.054
CALLING IT SOMETHING MAKES

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:20.422
EDUCATION PIECE A LITTLE BIT

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.124
EASIER WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.692
PREVENT THIS I THINK IT'S YOU

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:24.559
KNOW I THINK THAT THE OTHER DAY

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:25.560
IT'S ABOUT HOW DO WE PREVENT

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:29.664
THIS OR. NOT YOU KNOW AND THE

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:32.868
SITUATIONS. RIGHT- AND THEN

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:36.605
LAST YEAR WE HAD. HOW DOES THIS

01:19:36.671 --> 01:19:37.772

SENATOR WIENER'S BILL THAT WAS

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:43.612
ABOUT LIKE IF SOMEBODY. I DON'T

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:44.212
KNOW IF I'M REMEMBERING

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.547
CORRECTLY HAS SOMEBODY

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:47.883
INTENTIONALLY OR- OR KNEW THAT

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:50.185
THEY HAD BEEN S. HIV OR AN STD

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:53.321
AND THEN. WE TOOK AWAY SOME OF

01:19:53.388 --> 01:19:53.955
THE CRIMINALITY ASSOCIATED WITH

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:56.925
THAT. THIS BILL IS NOT

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.793
AVAILABLE BUSINESSES IN A CIVIL

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.929
SENSE RIGHT DOES IT DOES IT

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:05.167
AFFECT. THAT LEGISLATION. THIS

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:06.768
BILL IS ONLY IN THE CIVIL PART

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.271
OF OUR CODE AND NOT AT ALL ON

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:13.542
THE PEEL SET OF A PHOTO FOR-

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:14.609
YOU DID HAVE LEGISLATION

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:16.011
PREVIOUSLY THAT WOULD HAVE MADE

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:17.646
THIS MORE IN THE CRIMINAL

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.548
ELEMENT I WONDER IS THAT IS

01:20:19.614 --> 01:20:20.682
THAT MAYBE THE MORE APPROPRIATE

01:20:20.749 --> 01:20:22.551
THING BECAUSE THIS THIS DOES

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.151
SEEM CRIMINAL I MEAN IT SEEMS

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:24.920

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:34.095
WHEN SOMEBODY DOES THIS RIGHT-

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.530
I MEAN MIGHT BE MORE

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:36.031
APPROPRIATE TO BE IN THE

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:39.267
CRIMINAL. STANDPOINT I THINK

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.169
THE DISCUSSION OF SHOULD BE AN

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.238

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.575
THEY HAVE UNIT AT A MINIMUM AND

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:47.909
OUR CIVIL CODE GIVES THE

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:49.277

THIS BILL. THE PART THAT. I'M

01:34:29.864 --> 01:34:31.298
ACTUALLY SAD TO SEE IS THAT

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:33.300
YOUR SON SETTING THIS BECAUSE

01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:34.301
EVEN THOUGH AND I KNOW YOU'RE

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:35.669
TRYING TO DEAL WITH. KIDS WERE

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:36.937
CAUGHT UP IN THIS WITH COVE IT

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:39.140
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS.

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:42.243
IS THERE. ARE SITUATIONS THAT

01:34:42.309 --> 01:34:44.678
HAPPENED FAR TOO OFTEN WHERE A

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.547
CHILD IS APPROACHING.

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:47.982
EIGHTEENTH BIRTHDAY AND JUST

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.383
DOESN'T GET IT JUDICATA BUT THE

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:50.918
FACT THAT THEY'VE BEEN REMOVED

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:51.485
FROM THE HOME THE FACT THAT

01:34:51.552 --> 01:34:54.922
THEY'VE- THEY HAVE. REALLY

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:56.924
TOUCH THE SYSTEM AT ALL MEANS

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:58.492
WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM AND WE

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.027
NEED TO SUPPORT THEM BEYOND

01:35:00.094 --> 01:35:01.729
EIGHTEEN AND THAT I AND I THINK

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:05.800
THE- OPPOSITION SUCH AS IT WAS.

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:07.535
TO THIS BILL WAS MISPLACED

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.003
BECAUSE THE QUESTIONS NOT

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:10.571
SHOULD WE SUPPORT THESE KIDS

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.572
ABSOLUTELY WE SHOULD SUPPORT

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:14.141
THESE KIDS. THE ISSUE IS WE

01:35:14.208 --> 01:35:15.776
NEED TO FUND THAT WE NEED TO

01:35:15.843 --> 01:35:17.711
ADEQUATELY FUND THAT PROGRAM SO

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:20.481
THAT. ALL KIDS WHO HAVE TOUCHED

01:35:20.548 --> 01:35:23.284
THE JUVENILE. THE DEPENDENCY

01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:24.919
SYSTEM WELL ACTUALLY DEPENDENCY

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.987
OR DELINQUENCY SYSTEM WHEREVER

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.589
THEY ARE THAT NEED THE SUPPORT

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.558
AND THE HELP. THAT NEEDS TO

01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:32.560
CONTINUE BEYOND THE AGE OF

01:35:32.626 --> 01:35:33.494
EIGHTEEN AND SO YOU'RE TAKING A

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.696
STEP I APPRECIATE THAT STEP AND

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:36.297
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:38.099
THIS CONTEXT. BUT WE HAVE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:40.367
CALIFORNIANS NEED TO BE SMARTER

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:42.002
ABOUT THIS AND RECOGNIZE THE

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:45.239
NEEDS OF THESE KIDS EVEN BEYOND

01:35:45.306 --> 01:35:46.373
EIGHTEEN AND THOSE WHO HAVE

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:46.941
GONE THROUGH THE TRAUMAS AND

01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:50.111
GONE THROUGH. THE FAMILY

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:51.946
SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE. OR

01:35:52.012 --> 01:35:53.180
DESERVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER

01:35:53.247 --> 01:35:54.982

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:57.751
ABOUT. FOR DEALING WITH NON

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.720
MINOR DEPENDENTS. BUT I WOULD

01:35:59.787 --> 01:36:01.021
SUBMIT THAT WE NEED TO DO

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.356
BETTER FOR ALL OF THOSE KIDS

01:36:02.423 --> 01:36:04.158

ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE SOCIAL

01:41:38.992 --> 01:41:41.061
MEDIA COMPANIES HAVE A POLICY

01:41:41.128 --> 01:41:41.962
MANDATES THAT THEY HAVE A

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:44.731

BECAUSE THE COMMITTEE. STAFF

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:36.016

01:42:36.083 --> 01:42:38.085
A REALLY SHOWING THE

01:42:38.151 --> 01:42:38.886
DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAW ON THIS

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:42.623
POINT- THE PRUNE YARD CASE.

01:42:42.689 --> 01:42:43.924

SCHOOL STUDENTS. WHO HAD GONE

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:48.495
TO A PRIVATE SHOPPING CENTER.

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.364
AND SET UP A CARD TABLE TO PUT

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:53.800
TO CIRCULATE- A PETITION.

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.669

THEY'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY THE

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:06.013
SECURITY CARD CAME OVER AND

01:43:06.079 --> 01:43:07.548
SAID HEY YOU'RE IN VIOLATION OF

01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:10.083
OUR PROTOCOLS. FOR THE SHOPPING

01:43:10.150 --> 01:43:11.685

NOT INVOLVED HERE- YOU DON'T

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:25.766
THERE'S NO FIRST AMENDMENT

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.734
PROTECTION AS AGAINST A PRIVATE

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:30.571
ACTORS. I WIN THAT ONE UP TO

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:32.306
THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.507
THIS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT

01:43:33.574 --> 01:43:35.642
SAID ACTUALLY NO- THE

01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:37.210
CALIFORNIA STATE CONSTITUTIONAL

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:40.080
PROVISIONS. REGARDING SPEECH

01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:42.282
ARE ACTUALLY STRONGER THAN.

01:43:42.349 --> 01:43:44.885
ACTUALLY GO FURTHER THAN THE U.

01:43:44.952 --> 01:43:46.420
S. CONSTITUTION'S. FIRST

01:43:46.486 --> 01:43:49.389
AMENDMENT. AND IN FACT LOOKING

01:43:49.456 --> 01:43:51.458
AT PREVIOUS CASE LAW WE'RE

01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:53.460
DEALING WITH FOR EXAMPLE ANTI

01:43:53.527 --> 01:43:54.661
WAR DEMONSTRATORS WHO SHOWED UP

01:43:54.728 --> 01:43:56.530
AT A PRIVATE RAIL YARD RAIL

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:58.966
STATION- THAT WAS A PRECEDENT

01:43:59.032 --> 01:44:00.100
WHERE A CALIFORNIA COURT SAID

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:02.502
YES THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE THERE

01:44:02.569 --> 01:44:03.036
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PRIVATE

01:44:03.103 --> 01:44:06.340
PROPERTY- AND THEY FALL THROUGH

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:07.608
IN THIS CASE. ALL THE

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.276
PRECEDENTS AND ESTABLISH THAT

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:11.511
NO YES THE STUDENTS. HAD A

01:44:11.578 --> 01:44:13.747
RIGHT TO SPEAK. ON THIS PRIVATE

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:16.149
PROPERTY BECAUSE AND HERE'S THE

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:18.819
KEY CRITERIA THAT WE AS A

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:19.453
COMMITTEE I THINK SHOULD REALLY

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:21.955
BE THINKING ABOUT- THE KEY

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.690
CRITERIA WAS THIS WAS A PLACE

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:25.659
THAT WAS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:28.695
COMPLETELY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC-

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:29.896
ENTERED ACTUALLY X. SORT OF

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:32.866
DISPLACED. WHAT USED TO BE. THE

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.635
PUBLIC SQUARE YOU KNOW IN IN

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:36.370
TRADITIONALLY YOU'D HAVE THE

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:36.970
PUBLIC SQUARE LIKE KIND OF IN

01:44:37.037 --> 01:44:38.972
THE TOWN CENTER. YOU KNOW AND

01:44:39.039 --> 01:44:40.140
PEOPLE WOULD GATHER THERE AND

01:44:40.207 --> 01:44:41.308
THEY WOULD SPEAK THEIR PEACE

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:43.810
THEY WOULD YOU KNOW- TALK ABOUT

01:44:43.877 --> 01:44:45.479
DIFFERENT ISSUES OF THE DAY.

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:47.180
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'D SEE A

01:44:47.247 --> 01:44:49.082
LOT OF THAT EXPRESSION WELL. BY

01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:50.517
THE TIME THIS CASE ROLLED

01:44:50.584 --> 01:44:52.486
ROLLED AROUND IN THE SEVENTIES.

01:44:52.552 --> 01:44:53.520
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THAT BE

01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:54.921
DISPLACED AND NOW YOU KNOW

01:44:54.988 --> 01:44:56.590
SHOPPING MALLS HAVE BECOME MUCH

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:57.491
MORE PREVALENT AND THAT'S WHERE

01:44:57.557 --> 01:44:59.960
PEOPLE. WERE DOING THAT WELL

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.029
NOW WE'RE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:45:02.095 --> 01:45:02.963
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.498
THERE'S NOT LESS PEOPLE BEING

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:07.467
AT SHOPPING MALLS. A LOT OF

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:08.035
SHOPPING MALLS GOING OUT OF

01:45:08.101 --> 01:45:11.938
BUSINESS ACTUALLY- AND CLEARLY

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:13.807
MUCH OF OUR POLITICAL DIALOGUE.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.976
IN OUR DISCOURSE IS NOW

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:18.111
HAPPENING ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR

01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:20.280
BETTER OR FOR WORSE. THAT'S

01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:22.549
WHERE IT'S HAPPENING. SO THE

01:45:22.616 --> 01:45:23.784
NEW PUBLIC SQUARE AND I THINK

01:45:23.850 --> 01:45:25.052
WE COULD ALL REALLY AGREE ON

01:45:25.118 --> 01:45:26.687
THIS THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE IS

01:45:26.753 --> 01:45:28.422
IN FACT IN FACEBOOK AND TWITTER

01:45:28.488 --> 01:45:31.091
WE ALL HAVE ACCOUNTS. RIGHT AND

01:45:31.158 --> 01:45:32.492
IN FACT WE'RE TOLD AS PUBLIC

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.227
OFFICIALS. IF WE HAVE AN

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:37.431
ACCOUNT. AND WE'RE AND WE

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.432
COMMENT AND PEOPLE ARE

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:40.133
COMMENTING ON OURS WE CANNOT

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.436
ACTUALLY EXCLUDE THOSE PEOPLE

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:43.970
FROM COMMENTING BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:45.906
CREATED A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM.

01:45:45.972 --> 01:45:48.208
SUPREME COURT JUST ACTUALLY

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:50.811
RULED THAT THAT IS THE CASE- SO

01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:54.014
CLEARLY WE NOW HAVE IN SOCIAL

01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:56.717
MEDIA THE NEW TOWNSQUARE VERY

01:45:56.783 --> 01:45:59.486
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE PRUNE YARD

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:00.087
CASE HAD A SAID ABOUT SHOPPING

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:03.957
MALLS. IT'S OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.392
ANYBODY CAN GET IT FACEBOOK OR

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.527
TWITTER ACCOUNT YOU GO ON THERE

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:10.063
YOU SIGN UP AND YOU GET GOING

01:46:10.130 --> 01:46:12.499
RIGHT I MEAN NO ONE IS ACTUALLY

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:16.069
EXCLUDED. FROM GOING ON THERE

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:16.636
AND CERTAINLY PEOPLE SAY ALL

01:46:16.703 --> 01:46:19.339
KINDS OF THINGS- ON THOSE

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:22.409
ACCOUNTS- AND THEN THE OTHER

01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:25.212
IMPORTANT CRITERIA IS THAT ALSO

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:27.614
THAT NO ONE COULD REASONABLY

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:29.649
ATTRIBUTE THE SPEECH TO THE

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:30.951
OWNER OF THE PROPERTY SO THEY

01:46:31.017 --> 01:46:32.319
SAID IN THIS CASE WILL LOOK NO

01:46:32.385 --> 01:46:34.187
ONE'S REASONABLY GOING TO

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:36.256
ATTRIBUTE THAT THIS PETITION

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:38.959
ABOUT ZIONISM IS WHAT THE-

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:39.526
OWNERS OF THE SHOPPING MALL

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:42.129
THINK. THEY KNOW THAT IT'S THIS

01:46:42.195 --> 01:46:44.498
GROUP THAT HAS A CARD TABLE

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:47.300
THAT'S THEIR SPEECH RIGHT. SO

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:48.235
TO ON SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK IT'S

01:46:48.301 --> 01:46:50.237
PRETTY CLEAR SOMEONE COMMENTING

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.805
OR SOMEONE POSTING IT'S THEIR

01:46:51.872 --> 01:46:52.939
VIEW POINT NO ONE WOULD

01:46:53.006 --> 01:46:54.441
HONESTLY SAY OH THAT'S MARK

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:58.378
ZUCKERBERG'S. VIEWPOINT YOU

01:46:58.445 --> 01:46:58.945
KNOW IT'S VERY CLEAR THIS IS

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:01.681
JUST A PLATFORM. THEY'RE NOT

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:03.917
THE YOU KNOW THEY ARE NOT THE-

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:04.918
THE ONES THAT ARE ACTUALLY

01:47:04.985 --> 01:47:06.887
SPEAKING AND SO THESE

01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:09.389
PRINCIPLES FIT RIGHT IN LINE

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:11.691
WITH CALIFORNIA CASE LAW. THAT

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.193
THE FIRST AMENDMENT SHOULD

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.895
APPLY TO THE SOCIAL MEDIA.

01:47:14.961 --> 01:47:19.566
PLATFORMS. NOW I KNOW THERE IS

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:21.234
A HESITATION WITH THAT BECAUSE

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.736
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THIS IS

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.337
NEW BUT I HAD WERE IN THIS

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:25.272
THEME I THINK IN THIS COMMITTEE

01:47:25.338 --> 01:47:27.407
OF HOW WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.042
HOW TO APPLY LEGAL PRINCIPLES

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.311
TO NEW THINGS. NEW INNOVATIONS

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:33.280
THAT HAVE COME IN- AND SO

01:47:33.346 --> 01:47:35.148
THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IT IS

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:37.050
NOT APPROPRIATE TO SAY THAT

01:47:37.117 --> 01:47:38.218
JUST AS IT WAS THE CASE IN THE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:41.354
SHOPPING MALL CASE SOCIAL MEDIA

01:47:41.421 --> 01:47:43.857
PLATFORM SHOULD BE SUBJECT. TO

01:47:43.924 --> 01:47:45.992
THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND FREE

01:47:46.059 --> 01:47:48.028
SPEECH. PROTECTIONS GET INTO

01:47:48.094 --> 01:47:49.930
THE SECOND PART. I THINK WE ALL

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:51.965
KNOW THAT HEY THERE ARE ABUSES

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:54.701
AND WE SEEN THOSE ABUSES. SO

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:56.436
THAT IS WHY WE OUT INTO THIS

01:47:56.503 --> 01:48:02.242
BILL A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES.

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.877
PROTECTED FOUR FORMS OF SPEECH

01:48:03.944 --> 01:48:06.012
OBSCENITY. INCITEMENT TO

01:48:06.079 --> 01:48:09.583
VIOLENCE- IT DOES GET SOMEWHAT

01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:10.584
STICKY AND ALSO I'LL BE THE

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:12.118
FIRST TO ADMIT THIS IS HARD TO

01:48:12.185 --> 01:48:13.787
FIGURE OUT BECAUSE EVERYBODY

01:48:13.854 --> 01:48:14.321
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

01:48:14.387 --> 01:48:16.456
MISINFORMATION HOW DO WE DEAL

01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:19.259
WITH MISINFORMATION. AND THE

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:23.196
PROBLEM FOR FIRST AMENDMENT.

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:25.632
CASE LAWS LOOK. TO SAY QUITE

01:48:25.699 --> 01:48:27.500
SIMPLY PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:30.003
BE WRONG. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:33.139
SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS WRONG.

01:48:33.206 --> 01:48:34.674
IS NOT REALLY A BASIS FOR

01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:36.877
SOMEONE TO SUPPRESS THAT SPEECH.

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:38.511
TRADITIONALLY THE WAY THAT

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.146
WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT IS BY THE

01:48:40.213 --> 01:48:42.148
IS BY FREE SPEECH ITSELF BY

01:48:42.215 --> 01:48:44.217
PEOPLE CALLING OUT. THE

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.685
FALSENESS ARE SAYING THAT'S NOT

01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:47.287
TRUE WHEN YOU HAVE A TRUE FREE

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:49.923
MARKET OF SPEECH. IS ALLOWED TO

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.458
CALL THAT CALL THAT OUT IT'S

01:48:51.524 --> 01:48:53.093
HARD TO GET AT MISINFORMATION

01:48:53.159 --> 01:48:55.161
THE BEST WE HAVE REALLY IN THE

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:56.830
COMMERCIAL CONTEST FOR FALSE

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.266
ADVERTISING. YOU KNOW THAT IS

01:48:59.332 --> 01:49:00.734
UNPROTECTED SPEECH WHEN YOU'RE

01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.502
TRYING TO SELL SOMETHING. AND

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:04.704
YOU SAY THAT IT DOES SOMETHING

01:49:04.771 --> 01:49:07.173
IT IN ACTUALLY DOES NOT. YOU

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:09.809
KNOW THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:11.544
BE REGULATED AND ACTED UPON-

01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:13.747
AND THAT BUT THAT'S- THE WINDOW

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:16.016
WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH IS

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:18.151
HOW DO WE DEAL WITH ABUSES. OF

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:20.287
SPEECH THIS DOES ENSURE THAT

01:49:20.353 --> 01:49:21.688
THOSE THOSE JUST SOCIAL MEDIA

01:49:21.755 --> 01:49:24.190
PLATFORMS. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:26.993
HAVE. SUCH A POLICY SO I THINK

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:29.095
IT STRIKES THE BALANCE. AND IT

01:49:29.162 --> 01:49:30.563
DOES SO CONSISTENT WITH

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:35.402
CALIFORNIA'S- UNIQUE AND I

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:37.804
THINK VERY IMPORTANT FREE

01:49:37.871 --> 01:49:38.238
SPEECH RIGHTS IN ITS

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:41.141
CONSTITUTION- AND SO FOR THOSE

01:49:41.207 --> 01:49:42.275
REASONS I ASKED YOU KNOW FOR

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:43.543
YOUR SUPPORT I KNOW THIS IS

01:49:43.610 --> 01:49:46.246
THIS IS A NEW. NEW FRONTIER

01:49:46.313 --> 01:49:49.115
THAT WE'RE DELVING INTO- BUT AS

01:49:49.182 --> 01:49:50.350
WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S

NOT REALLY TRYING TO INTERFERE

01:51:36.222 --> 01:51:37.657
MR KILEY WITH YOUR ABILITY TO

01:51:37.724 --> 01:51:39.559
SPEAK ON THIS BILL BUT I'M

01:51:39.626 --> 01:51:41.394
COGNIZANT OF SORT OF THE NEXT

01:51:41.461 --> 01:51:42.896

NEXT BILL AND IF WE HAVE THE

01:51:45.632 --> 01:51:47.233
EXPECTATION THAT ANY NUMBER OF

01:51:50.503 --> 01:51:52.772
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:54.040
CONDUCIVE TO GETTING BUSINESS

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:54.774
DONE IN THE COMING YEAR

01:51:54.841 --> 01:51:58.311

THE COMITTEE. BECAUSE THAT

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.850
STILL IS ON THE RECORD AND

01:52:03.917 --> 01:52:06.352
STILL IS A PART OF IT. SO WE'LL

01:52:06.419 --> 01:52:08.488
MOVE AND MISTER CALDERON I WAS

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:09.656
A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT THE

01:52:09.722 --> 01:52:12.025

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:13.460

01:52:21.367 --> 01:52:24.304
AMBIT OF. THE PRINTER DECISION

01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:25.438
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A I

01:52:25.505 --> 01:52:26.840
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I THINK

01:52:26.906 --> 01:52:28.274
THERE ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT

01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:30.543
DISTINCTIONS. THAT THERE YES WE

01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:32.612
HAVE YET TO SOLVE. SO I WAS

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:36.049
EXPECTING. THE BILL TO BE

01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:37.016
MODIFIED THAT WAS WITH OUR

01:52:37.083 --> 01:52:39.285

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:43.189
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:46.392
RECOMMENDING THAT THE BILL BE

MODIFIED THAT THAT YOU TAKE THE

01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:49.996

DEFINITIONS TO BE THE BILL AND

01:52:55.969 --> 01:52:58.972
MOVE FORWARD. SO AT MY

01:52:59.038 --> 01:52:59.539
UNDERSTANDING IS YOU'RE NOT

ADD THE SECOND PART TO ENSURE

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:17.157
THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAD

01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:19.492
A POLICY. AND THAT WITH THOSE

01:53:19.559 --> 01:53:21.461

01:53:21.528 --> 01:53:23.263

I DO HAVE AN ISSUE AND I DON'T

02:06:03.055 --> 02:06:05.724
AGREE. THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:06:05.791 --> 02:06:06.458
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OVERLY

02:06:06.525 --> 02:06:08.694
SIMPLISTIC TO SUGGEST C. AS IN

02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:10.195
PRUNING ARE THAT THESE ARE.

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:11.964
LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS BECAUSE

02:06:12.031 --> 02:06:12.831
THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:14.700
DISTINCTIONS HERE AND THAT IS

02:06:14.767 --> 02:06:17.937
THE- ANYBODY INCLUDING THE KIDS

02:06:18.003 --> 02:06:18.971
COULD WALK INTO THE PRISON YARD

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.739
AND SET UP A TABLE. BUT THAT'S

02:06:20.806 --> 02:06:22.741
NOT TRUE ON SOCIAL MEDIA

02:06:22.808 --> 02:06:25.411
PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO. EXPRESS

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:27.012
SPEECH ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM

02:06:27.079 --> 02:06:29.214
YOU NEED TO BE A MEMBER HAVE AN

02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:31.483
ACCOUNT AND THOSE COUNTS. ARE

02:06:31.550 --> 02:06:32.651
OFTEN VETTED AND WE'VE REALLY

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:34.420
STRUGGLED WITH WITH WITH THE

02:06:34.486 --> 02:06:36.288
BOX AND THE OTHER SORT OF

02:06:36.355 --> 02:06:38.324
ILLEGITIMATE. ACCOUNTS THAT

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:39.658
HAVE BEEN CREATED AND WE'VE

02:06:39.725 --> 02:06:43.329
BEEN HAVE BEEN ASKING THE- AND

02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:45.864
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO CLEAN

02:06:45.931 --> 02:06:48.534
SOME OF THAT UP. ALSO THE

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.935
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS OVER THE

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:52.471
YEARS HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO

02:06:52.538 --> 02:06:54.206
EVEN WEIGH IN ON ANY CONTENT

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:55.641
AND I THINK THE PRESSURE OVER

02:06:55.708 --> 02:06:57.543
THE YEARS HAS FINALLY KIND OF

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:59.511
COME TO THE FORE WHERE THEY ARE

02:06:59.578 --> 02:07:01.714
MORE SENSITIVE TO BEING AND

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:03.182
WILLING TO REMOVE HATE SPEECH

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:04.350
AND OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:06.218
FACT OBJECTIONABLE. AND IF WE

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:08.087
CREATE A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM

02:07:08.153 --> 02:07:10.489
IN THIS CASE IT IN IN THAT CASE

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:11.890
WHICH WHICH I WHICH I STILL

02:07:11.957 --> 02:07:15.060
THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IS. IS NOT

02:07:15.127 --> 02:07:16.061
APPROPRIATE EVEN UNDER PRUNE

02:07:16.128 --> 02:07:18.397
YARD AND THE JURISPRUDENCE

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:21.633
ALONG THE WAY BUT IF WE- DO.

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.801
CREATE A LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.103
IT IS GOING TO HAVE A CHILLING

02:07:24.169 --> 02:07:25.871
EFFECT ON WHAT WE'RE ASKING.

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.407
THE PLATFORMS TO DO AND THAT IS

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:30.275
REMOVED HATE SPEECH AND REMOVE

02:07:30.342 --> 02:07:31.643
SPEECH THAT THAT IS

02:07:31.710 --> 02:07:33.579
OBJECTIONABLE WHICH IS WHY I

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:34.613
THINK IT'S MORE PORT AT THIS

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:36.548
POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:07:36.615 --> 02:07:38.217
PLATFORMS ARE IDENTIFYING VERY

02:07:38.283 --> 02:07:40.052
CLEAR. ABOUT THE KINDS OF

02:07:40.119 --> 02:07:41.587
THINGS THAT THE REMOVING OR NOT

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:43.655
I THINK THAT IS UNCLEAR TO MOST

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:45.224
OF US AND HOW THEY FUNCTION AND

02:07:45.290 --> 02:07:46.058
HOW THEY FUNCTION BEHIND THE

02:07:46.125 --> 02:07:48.527
SCENES. ONE OF THE WITNESSES

02:07:48.594 --> 02:07:51.130
MENTIONED THAT A. I. OKAY I

02:07:51.196 --> 02:07:51.730
KNOW THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGH

02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:55.501
A I'VE- BUT WHAT. WAS DEVELOP

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:56.935
WHAT ALGORITHMS ARE DRIVING

02:07:57.002 --> 02:07:58.570
THAT A. I. AND HOW THAT'S BEING

02:07:58.637 --> 02:07:59.671
PROCESSED OR THINGS THAT I

02:07:59.738 --> 02:08:01.273
THIN WE ALL IN THE PUBLIC AND

02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:02.641
THE USERS OF THESE PLATFORMS

02:08:02.708 --> 02:08:03.575
REALLY NEED TO BETTER

02:08:03.642 --> 02:08:05.044
UNDERSTAND. SO THAT'S AN

02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:06.879
APPROPRIATE STEP I AM VERY

02:08:06.945 --> 02:08:10.849
CAUTIOUS ABOUT TAKING THIS LEAP

02:08:10.916 --> 02:08:12.151
TO SAYING THAT IT IS A LIMITED

02:08:12.217 --> 02:08:13.952
PUBLIC FORUM BECAUSE OF THE

02:08:14.019 --> 02:08:15.687
VERY CLEAR DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.856
WHAT THESE FORMS ARE. AND

02:08:17.923 --> 02:08:19.458
SOMETHING LIKE A SHOPPING MALL

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:21.593
TWITTER FACEBOOK ARE NOT LIKE

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.196
SHOPPING MALLS NOW AMAZON AND

02:08:24.263 --> 02:08:25.364
OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE

02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:26.365
PROVIDING ELECTRONIC

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:28.367
MARKETPLACES ARE BECAUSE YOU

02:08:28.434 --> 02:08:32.171
DON'T REALLY NEED TO. HAVE AN

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:35.040
pACTUALLY AND A LOT OF THOSE YOU

02:08:35.107 --> 02:08:35.941
DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN ACCOUNT

02:08:36.008 --> 02:08:37.609
IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE THE

02:08:37.676 --> 02:08:39.411
SERVICES BUT TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:08:39.478 --> 02:08:41.647
SOCIAL MEDIA YOU DO. AND SO THE

02:08:41.713 --> 02:08:43.115
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY HAS THE

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:45.117
ABILITY TO HAVE AN INTERACTION

02:08:45.184 --> 02:08:46.919
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND WE WANT

02:08:46.985 --> 02:08:48.787
TO FACILITATE THAT OTHERWISE IF

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:49.788
WE SAY THAT THESE ARE NOW

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:51.990
LIMITED PUBLIC FORUMS WE ARE

02:08:52.057 --> 02:08:53.992
GOING TO BE OPENING UP. ALL

02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:56.995
KINDS OF POSSIBILITIES FOR

02:08:57.062 --> 02:08:59.131
SPEECH THAT WE ARE FINALLY IS A

02:08:59.198 --> 02:09:00.799
SITE SOCIETY TRYING TO GRAPPLE

02:09:00.866 --> 02:09:02.801
WITH THIS THING NOT APPROPRIATE

02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:05.571
IN THE SETTINGS AND WE WOULD

02:09:05.637 --> 02:09:06.738
DEFINITELY SORT OF CHILL FOR

02:09:06.805 --> 02:09:08.407
THAT AND THAT'S WHY I HAD

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:11.343
THOUGHT WE WERE IN AGREEMENT.

02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:13.479
TO TAKE OUT. LINES SIX THROUGH

02:09:13.545 --> 02:09:16.014
NINE SUBSECTION HEY AND THEN RE

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:16.982
LETTER RIGHT AND THAT'S THE

02:09:17.049 --> 02:09:19.084
AMENDMENT THAT WAS. THAT WAS

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:21.820
PROPOSED AND- INSURE THAT WE

02:09:21.887 --> 02:09:23.188
HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:25.390
WHAT THESE PLATFORMS ARE DOING

02:09:25.457 --> 02:09:27.960
RATHER THAN THROWING THEM IN

02:09:28.026 --> 02:09:29.061
APPROPRIATE INTO THE CATEGORY

02:09:29.128 --> 02:09:32.197
OF LIMITED PUBLIC FORUM. WHICH

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:34.800
WOULD THEN FACILITATE THE OR OR

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:36.335
BLOCK THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THE

02:09:36.401 --> 02:09:38.270
PROGRESS WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN

02:09:38.337 --> 02:09:40.472
THEM MAKING IN GOING AFTER HATE

02:09:40.539 --> 02:09:43.041
SPEECH INAPPROPRIATE SPEECH. WE

02:09:43.108 --> 02:09:44.977
WOULD BE PUTTING THEM. IN A

02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:46.211
VERY TOUGH POSITION I THINK NOT

02:09:46.278 --> 02:09:47.346
MAKING DECISIONS BECAUSE IS

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:48.413
WHAT THEY'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.748
BEFORE DECIDING WHAT IS

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.650
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:52.017
SPEECH WHAT IS A

02:09:52.084 --> 02:09:52.918
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:55.120
SPEECH. AND I'LL- I THINK IT'S

02:09:55.187 --> 02:09:56.788
APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GO DOWN

02:09:56.855 --> 02:10:03.128
THAT PATH. SO I AM IT IF. I'D

02:10:03.195 --> 02:10:03.962
BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL WITH

02:10:04.029 --> 02:10:06.165
THE AMENDMENT IF IT'S NOT GOING

02:10:06.231 --> 02:10:07.633
TO BE AMENDED THAT I'M

02:10:07.699 --> 02:10:09.067
RECOMMENDING AND I'M HOPING

02:10:09.134 --> 02:10:11.537
THAT THIS COMMITTEE. WILL VOTE

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:14.706
NO ON THIS BILL SO I HAVE

02:10:14.773 --> 02:10:16.008
MISTER MAIENSCHEIN AND MISTER

02:10:16.074 --> 02:10:16.775
KILEY I'M GONNA GO TO MISTER

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:19.244
KILEY FIRST JUST BECAUSE OF

02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:21.647
SORT OF THE INTERACTION HERE

02:10:21.713 --> 02:10:24.049
WHO WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE OF

02:10:24.116 --> 02:10:26.251
THE TOPICS IN THE BILL AND THEN

02:10:26.318 --> 02:10:27.953
I'LL GO TO MISTER MAIENSCHEIN

02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:30.856
AND- DID ANYONE ELSE. THANK YOU

02:10:30.923 --> 02:10:32.424
I APPRECIATE THE PRIVILEGE OF.

02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:33.625
SPEAKING ON A BILL I'M CO

02:10:33.692 --> 02:10:35.794
AUTHORING ABOUT FREE SPEECH- I

02:10:35.861 --> 02:10:38.530
DID WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES.

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.599
RELATED TO SECTION TWO THIRTY-

02:10:40.666 --> 02:10:42.367
THAT WERE. QUITE APPROPRIATELY

02:10:42.434 --> 02:10:43.936
BROUGHT UP- IN THAT COMMITTEE

02:10:44.002 --> 02:10:46.471
ANALYSIS AND- I'LL RAISE BY

02:10:46.538 --> 02:10:48.540
OPPOSITION AND IN THE ANALYSIS

02:10:48.607 --> 02:10:49.274
BY THE WAY I THOUGHT WAS REALLY

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:51.310
WELL DONE. AND THIS IS

02:10:51.376 --> 02:10:54.446
OBVIOUSLY THE- THE MAJOR-

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:56.782
IMPEDIMENT TO ANY ATTEMPT TO

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.717
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE IS THAT-

02:10:58.784 --> 02:10:59.818
SECTION TWO THIRTY DOES

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:01.720
PROVIDE- PRETTY SWEEPING

02:11:01.787 --> 02:11:04.323
IMMUNITY- BOAST BOTH FOR WHAT

02:11:04.389 --> 02:11:07.159
IS POSTED AND- FOR WHAT IS. A

02:11:07.226 --> 02:11:09.861
REMOVED. HOWEVER I THINK THAT

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.830
THERE ARE A COUPLE ANSWERS TO

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:14.333
THAT- IN THIS CONTEXT THE FIRST

02:11:14.399 --> 02:11:17.236
I HAVE A PRETTY. NARROW POINT-

02:11:17.302 --> 02:11:19.104
WHICH IS BASED UPON THE

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.339
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:21.974
OF HASSLE THE BIRD NOW THE

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:23.909
APPELLATE COURT IN THAT CASE-

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.811
HELD THAT IN. A PARTICULAR

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:28.513
CONTEXT- THE LIABILITY SHIELD

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.015
IS NOT A BAR TO INJUNCTIVE

02:11:30.082 --> 02:11:31.617
RELIEF THAT MIGHT BE A BAR TO

02:11:31.683 --> 02:11:33.151
MONETARY RELIEF. BUT NOT TO

02:11:33.218 --> 02:11:35.287
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT DECISION

02:11:35.354 --> 02:11:36.722
WAS REVERSED FOR THREE BY THE

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.690
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

02:11:38.757 --> 02:11:40.359
HOWEVER IT WAS IN A SOMEWHAT

02:11:40.425 --> 02:11:41.293
DIFFERENT POSTURE WERE THERE

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:42.261
THEY WERE DEALING WITH

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:43.762
LIABILITY FOR POSTING AS

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:44.763
OPPOSED TO HEAR DEALING WITH

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.898
LIABILITY. AFTER REMOVING

02:11:46.965 --> 02:11:48.634
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A PERHAPS

02:11:48.700 --> 02:11:51.103
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SECTION-

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.237
TWO THIRTY JURISPRUDENCE SINCE

02:11:52.304 --> 02:11:53.305
THEN THAT WOULD MAKE THE

02:11:53.372 --> 02:11:55.707
DISSENTING OPINION IN THAT CASE

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:56.275
THE ARGUMENTS THERE PERHAPS

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:57.909
HAVE MORE FORCE. ABOUT MY

02:11:57.976 --> 02:12:00.045
BROTHER ARGUMENT. IS THAT- I

02:12:00.112 --> 02:12:02.314
THINK THAT. THE SECTION TWO

02:12:02.381 --> 02:12:04.850
THIRTY- JURISPRUDENCE IS A VERY

02:12:04.916 --> 02:12:10.422
A WIDE AREA OF WATER RIGHT NOW-

02:12:10.489 --> 02:12:11.189
AND- AS- THIS GALLAGHER MENTION

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:12.824
IN HIS PRE. WE EVEN HAVE A

02:12:12.891 --> 02:12:15.227
RECENT. DECISION OF THE FEDERAL

02:12:15.294 --> 02:12:16.495
COURT'S SHOWING THAT IN. A

02:12:16.561 --> 02:12:18.030
PARTICULAR CONTEXT A PUBLIC

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:20.599
FIGURE'S POSTS EVEN THOUGH

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:22.701
THERE ARE- THROUGH A PRIVATE

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:24.903
PLATFORM- CAN BE CONSIDERED

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:27.472
GOVERNMENT SPEECH. AND I THINK

02:12:27.539 --> 02:12:28.006
THERE ARE MANY INDICATIONS

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:31.043
THAT- THAT THINGS WILL CONTINUE

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:33.979
TO DEVELOP- IN THAT WAY BECAUSE

02:12:34.046 --> 02:12:35.180
IT'S A WELL ESTABLISHED

02:12:35.247 --> 02:12:36.181
PRINCIPLE OF THE UNITED STATES

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.716
SUPREME COURT. THE QUOTE THE

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.551
GOVERNMENT MAY NOT INDUCE

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:41.019
ENCOURAGE OR PROMOTE PRIVATE

02:12:41.086 --> 02:12:43.121
PERSONS TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT IT

02:12:43.188 --> 02:12:45.724
IS CONSTITUTIONALLY FORBIDDEN.

02:12:45.791 --> 02:12:47.759
TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT WE'VE

02:12:47.826 --> 02:12:49.528
SEEN WITH SECTION TWO THIRTY.

02:12:49.594 --> 02:12:51.296
IS THE GOVERNMENT HAS

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.265
ESSENTIALLY BY GRANTING

02:12:53.332 --> 02:12:55.901
IMMUNITY. ALLOWED A HANDFUL OF

02:12:55.967 --> 02:12:58.870
MAJOR COMPANIES- TO BECOME THE

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:01.740
MAJOR GATEKEEPERS AFTER PUBLIC

02:13:01.807 --> 02:13:04.343
DISCOURSE IN OUR SOCIETY. AND I

02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:05.544
THINK THAT AT THE POINT AT

02:13:05.610 --> 02:13:07.446
WHICH- THE GOVERNMENT HAS

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:08.914
PROVIDED THE LATTER THROUGH

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:09.848
WHICH THEY ASSUME THEIR

02:13:09.915 --> 02:13:11.950
DOMINANT MARKET SHARE. I THEN

02:13:12.017 --> 02:13:13.285
ACCORDING TO WELL ESTABLISHED

02:13:13.352 --> 02:13:14.720
PRINT- PRESIDENTS OF THE U. S.

02:13:14.786 --> 02:13:16.288
SUPREME COURT. THEN THE

02:13:16.355 --> 02:13:18.790
OBLIGATIONS OF GOVERNMENT NOT

02:13:18.857 --> 02:13:20.325
TO INTERFERE WITH SPEAK

02:13:20.392 --> 02:13:21.293
CONSCIOUSLY PROTECT PROTECTED

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:23.962
SPEECH- ATTACH AT THAT POINT AS

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:25.864
WELL. IN FACT YOU CAN EVEN GO A

02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.199
STEP FURTHER. THERE ARE

02:13:27.265 --> 02:13:29.634
MULTIPLE EXAMPLES AND I FEEL

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:30.569
LIKE THERE IS AN ALLUSION TO

02:13:30.635 --> 02:13:31.403
THIS EVEN IN THE CHAIR'S

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:34.172
REMARKS THAT WE JUST HEARD-

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:36.641
REGULATORS AND OF GOVERNMENT.

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:37.809
GIVING THESE COMPANIES

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:39.611
DIRECTION ON EXACTLY WHAT THEY

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:41.079
SHOULD CENSOR AND WHAT HE

02:13:41.146 --> 02:13:42.748
SHOULD REMOVE. AND AT THAT

02:13:42.814 --> 02:13:44.683
POINT IT'S VERY CLEAR. THAT

02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:47.085
THEY HAVE BEEN DEPUTIZED- BY

02:13:47.152 --> 02:13:49.421
THE STATE OR ACTING. OUT OF

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:52.391
FEAR OF- YOU KNOW A PUNITIVE

02:13:52.457 --> 02:13:54.126
RESPONSE ON THE PART OF THE

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:55.861
STATE. AND THERE'S ALSO A VERY

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:57.062
WELL ESTABLISHED LINE OF CASES

02:13:57.129 --> 02:14:00.065
SHOWING THAT CONSTITUTIONAL

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.767
FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS.

02:14:01.833 --> 02:14:03.802
ATTACHED WHEN THAT IS THE CASE

02:14:03.869 --> 02:14:06.304
SO I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS

02:14:06.371 --> 02:14:10.575
AREA IS THAT RIGHT. FOR A

02:14:10.642 --> 02:14:11.309
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN CASE LAW

02:14:11.376 --> 02:14:14.179
I THINK THE- CAL. PROVIDES A

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:17.115
IDEAL- YOU KNOW A SET OF

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:18.750
CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THAT

02:14:18.817 --> 02:14:20.318
DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY BECAUSE

02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:21.653
WE'RE DEALING HERE WITH A LOT

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.822
OF CALIFORNIA COMPANIES- BUT

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:25.424
ALSO FOR THE REASON. MR

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.192
GALLAGHER CITED IN HIS REMARKS

02:14:27.259 --> 02:14:28.794
THE CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF I

02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.395
THINK IT'S ONLY A FEW STATES

02:14:30.462 --> 02:14:32.164
THAT GOES BEYOND THE U. S.

02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:34.433
CONSTITUTION'S PROHIBITION OF

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:35.133
GOVERNMENT INTERFERE ON

02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:36.868
GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE WITH

02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:37.436
SPEECH BUT ACTUALLY HAS AN

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:38.970
INFORMATIVE GUARANTEE. OF THE

02:14:39.037 --> 02:14:40.739
RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY WHICH IS

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.340
WHY WE HAVE A PRUNE YARD

02:14:42.407 --> 02:14:45.010
PRINCIPLE IN CALIFORNIA- WHERE

02:14:45.076 --> 02:14:46.244
IT DOESN'T EXIST UNDER THE US

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:48.313
CONSTITUTION IT DOESN'T EXIST.

02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:50.549
IN MANY OTHER STATES AND I FIND

02:14:50.615 --> 02:14:52.150
IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

02:14:52.217 --> 02:14:53.919
WHEN THE DRAFTERS OF SECTION

02:14:53.985 --> 02:14:56.021
TWO THIRTY CAME UP WITH THIS IN

02:14:56.087 --> 02:14:56.555
NINETEEN NINETY SIX IT WAS

02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:58.890
THEIR INTENTION. TO PREEMPT

02:14:58.957 --> 02:15:01.793
STATE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. AS

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.462
FAR AS PRE FREE SPEECH IS

02:15:03.528 --> 02:15:04.262
CONCERNED BECAUSE AT THAT POINT

02:15:04.329 --> 02:15:06.631
IN TIME. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN

02:15:06.698 --> 02:15:08.733
ENVISIONED THAT. THESE

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.835
COMPANIES ARE JUST A FEW OF

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:11.503
THEM. WOULD BECOME SUCH

02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:13.138
GATEKEEPERS A PUBLIC DISCOURSE

02:15:13.205 --> 02:15:15.073
THAT THE STATE CONSTITUTIONAL

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.142
PROVISIONS ARE IMPLICATED BUT

02:15:17.209 --> 02:15:18.743
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED.

02:15:18.810 --> 02:15:21.947
AND IT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE

02:15:22.013 --> 02:15:23.248
ASSISTANCE THAT HAS BEEN

02:15:23.315 --> 02:15:25.317
PROVIDED TO THESE COMPANIES. BY

02:15:25.383 --> 02:15:27.719
THE LIABILITY SHIELD OF SECTION

02:15:27.786 --> 02:15:29.421
TWO THIRTY SO. I THAT'S WHY I

02:15:29.488 --> 02:15:31.423
THINK THAT THOSE PARTICULAR

02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:33.892
LEGAL CONCERNS OUGHT NOT TO

02:15:33.959 --> 02:15:35.961
CARRY THE DAY HERE- AND JUST

02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:38.163
BRIEFLY. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS AS

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:41.099
THE POLICY GOES I MEAN I THINK

02:15:41.166 --> 02:15:43.635
THAT. MIGHT FAVORITE EXPRESSION

02:15:43.702 --> 02:15:45.237
OF THIS IDEA COMES FROM JOHN

02:15:45.303 --> 02:15:46.805
STUART MILL'S SORT OF CLASSICAL%

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:48.240
ENLIGHTENMENT LIBERAL THINKER

02:15:48.306 --> 02:15:50.175
HE SAID THE PECULIAR EVIL OF

02:15:50.242 --> 02:15:51.576
SILENCING THE EXPRESSION OF AN

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:53.278
OPINION IS IT IS ROBBING THOSE

02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:55.180
WHO TO STAND FOR THE OPINION.

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.381
STILL MORE THAN THOSE WHO HOLD

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:58.416
IT. IF THE IDEA IS RIGHT THEY

02:15:58.483 --> 02:15:59.684
ARE DEPRIVED OF THE OPPORTUNITY

02:15:59.751 --> 02:16:01.386
OF EXCHANGING ERROR FOR TRUTH

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:02.954
IF WRONG THEY LOSE WHAT IS

02:16:03.021 --> 02:16:04.356
ALMOST AS GREAT A BENEFIT. THE

02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:06.091
CLEARER PERCEPTION AND LIVELIER

02:16:06.157 --> 02:16:10.662
IMPRESSION OF TRUTH. PRODUCED

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:11.429
BY ITS COLLISION WITH AIR.

02:16:11.496 --> 02:16:13.265
THERE ARE SOME TRULY ODIOUS ID.

02:16:13.331 --> 02:16:16.468
HEY SPEECH. TERRIBLE THINGS

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:18.136
THAT ARE BEING EXPRESSED ON THE

02:16:18.203 --> 02:16:21.172
INTERNET BUT BY REMOVING THEM

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:24.009
FROM THE MOST POPULAR SITES

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:25.911
THEY DON'T GO AWAY THEY SIMPLY

02:16:25.977 --> 02:16:27.612
BUBBLE OFTEN RESURFACE IN AREAS

02:16:27.679 --> 02:16:28.747
WHERE THERE SN'T THE SAME

02:16:28.813 --> 02:16:30.982
OPPORTUNITY FOR REASONS COUNTER

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:33.218
ARGUMENT AND PERSUASION WHICH

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.219
IS WHY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:36.621
HISTORY. THE AS OUR SUPREME

02:16:36.688 --> 02:16:37.956
COURT HAS PUT IT THE REMEDY HAS

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:40.158
ALWAYS BEEN MORE SPEECH NOT

02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:42.260
ENFORCED SILENCE AND WHAT IS

02:16:42.327 --> 02:16:44.262
BEING SUPPRESSED IS NOT JUST

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:47.198
THESE TRULY ODIOUS IDEAS BUT A

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:48.466
MUCH BROADER SWATH OF SPEECH

02:16:48.533 --> 02:16:49.601
USED THE TERM STILL NOT SHOWING

02:16:49.668 --> 02:16:51.570
AFFECTED SOMEHOW REFER TO YOU

02:16:51.636 --> 02:16:53.705
KNOW- NOT ENOUGH CENSORSHIP BUT

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:54.906
THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OF CHILLING

02:16:54.973 --> 02:16:57.242
FACT IS THAT- SOMEONE WILL

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:59.477
STEER FAR CLEAR OF THE UNLAWFUL

02:16:59.544 --> 02:17:00.812
ZONE AND IT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE

02:17:00.879 --> 02:17:01.813
WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH THINGS

02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:02.814
LIKE DEACTIVATING YOUR TWITTER

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:04.182
ACCOUNT. OR YOUR FACEBOOK

02:17:04.249 --> 02:17:05.417
ACCOUNT MIGHT BE A BIG PART OF

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:07.152
SOMEONE'S LIFE AND YOU SAY WELL

02:17:07.218 --> 02:17:08.687
IF YOU VIOLATE SOME NEBULOUS

02:17:08.753 --> 02:17:09.621
TERMS WE'RE GOING TO DELETE

02:17:09.688 --> 02:17:11.556
THAT ENTIRELY THEN PEOPLE ARE

02:17:11.623 --> 02:17:13.625
GOING TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

02:17:13.692 --> 02:17:15.393
WHAT THEY DO AND SAY AND IT'S

02:17:15.460 --> 02:17:17.462
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SPEECH.

02:17:17.529 --> 02:17:18.563
IT IS SUPPRESSED AS A RESULT

02:17:18.630 --> 02:17:20.298
I'LL GIVE YOU I JUST A FINAL

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:22.467
EXAMPLE THAT WE SAW RECENTLY

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:24.436
THAT A PUBLIC ROUNDTABLE HOSTED

02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:25.537
BY FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:28.740
DESANTIS WAS REMOVED FROM YOU

02:17:28.807 --> 02:17:29.841
TOO THIS IS A ROUND TABLE WITH

02:17:29.908 --> 02:17:30.809
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS IN

02:17:30.875 --> 02:17:32.544
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FROM HARVARD

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:35.347
FROM STANFORD AND FROM OXFORD

02:17:35.413 --> 02:17:38.049
AND IT WAS- PROVIDING INSIGHT.

02:17:38.116 --> 02:17:40.819
INTO WHY GOVERNOR TO SANTOS HAS

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:41.820
PURSUED THE POLICIES THAT HE

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:44.556
HAS THAT BUT HE WAS REMOVED

02:17:44.623 --> 02:17:46.224
SUPPOSEDLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A

02:17:46.291 --> 02:17:48.727
BRIEF MENTION IN THAT VIDEO OF

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:51.162
HOW- ONE OF THE EXPERTS THERE

02:17:51.229 --> 02:17:52.631
DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WAS ADVISABLE

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:53.565
TO HAVE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:56.534
FIVE- WEAR MASKS AND YOU TO

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:57.569
PROVE IT SAYING THIS RUNS

02:17:57.636 --> 02:18:00.005
CONTRARY TO YOU KNOW PUBLIC

02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:01.039
HEALTH OPINION ACROSS THE

02:18:01.106 --> 02:18:02.774
GLOBE. THAT'S ACTUALLY WRONG

02:18:02.841 --> 02:18:04.876
THAT WHAT THE EXPERTS SAID WAS

02:18:04.943 --> 02:18:07.145
CONSISTENT WITH THE WHO'S OWN

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:09.014
GUIDANCE BUT LET'S SAY THAT

02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:10.882
YOU'RE A CRITIC OF GOVERNOR TO

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:12.083
SANTA'S IN HIS POLICIES WOULD

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:16.287
YOU WANT. TO HAVE ACCESS TO A

02:18:16.354 --> 02:18:17.956
VIDEO THE HIDES INSIDE INTO WHY

02:18:18.023 --> 02:18:19.190
PURSUED COURSE THE HE HAS ORDER

02:18:19.257 --> 02:18:19.858
CAN YOU CAN HAVE AN ON. AND CAN

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:22.160
BE PREPARED TO MAKE COUNTER

02:18:22.227 --> 02:18:24.062
ARGUMENTS THAT SPEAK TO THOSE

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:25.664
ISSUES. SO I THINK WE'RE

02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:28.700
DEALING WITH SOMETHING MUCH

02:18:28.767 --> 02:18:30.669
MORE IMPORTANT- HERE THAN. APPS

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:31.836
THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD-

02:18:31.903 --> 02:18:33.972
THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE I

02:18:34.039 --> 02:18:35.173
THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:36.341
MEASURE AND IT'S A WAY TO

02:18:36.408 --> 02:18:37.442
CALIFORNIA AND SORT OF BE

02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:41.346
CLAIM. ITS ROLE AS A NATIONAL

02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:41.946
LEADER IN THESE PRINCIPLES OF

02:18:42.013 --> 02:18:43.948
FREEDOM OF SPEECH. SO THANK YOU

02:18:44.015 --> 02:18:45.483
MR GALLAGHER FOR BRINGING THIS

IT IS. EVEN SO S. B. ASSUMING

THIS WOULD THAT A REQUIREMENT.

02:19:28.993 --> 02:19:31.162
OF A PRIVATE COMPANY TO HAVE A

02:19:31.229 --> 02:19:33.832
CERTAIN POLICY. IS A GOOD IDEA

02:19:33.898 --> 02:19:35.867
OR SOMETHING WE SHOULD PURSUE

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:37.535
THE POLICY BUT I THINK WE WOULD

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:38.470

02:19:44.642 --> 02:19:46.311
COMMUNICATION RIGHT OR

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:47.145
SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. IT

02:19:47.212 --> 02:19:51.449
WOULD PUT. THEN THE ONUS BACK

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:52.016
ON THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW

02:19:52.083 --> 02:19:55.186
WHETHER. A POLICY OF A PRIVATE

02:19:55.253 --> 02:19:57.322
COMPANY IS GOOD ENOUGH. AND

02:19:57.388 --> 02:19:59.090
THEN FROM THERE HOW IS IT IN

02:19:59.157 --> 02:19:59.858
FOUR STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE

02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:01.526
COMPANY WOULD SAY WE ARE WE'RE

02:20:01.593 --> 02:20:03.061

VERY BROAD. HOW HOW AS A

02:20:10.602 --> 02:20:13.605
PRACTICAL MATTER OR- WOULD YOU

02:20:13.671 --> 02:20:16.908
GET AT A EVEN. WHY WOULD BE A

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:19.511
GOOD IDEA TO TELL A PRIVATE

02:20:19.577 --> 02:20:21.813
COMPANY TO DEVELOP A POLICY

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.381
RIGHT WE ALL GET AWAY WITH ME.

RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF POLICIES

02:20:34.225 --> 02:20:35.927
HUGE BOOK OF POLICIES VERY

02:20:35.994 --> 02:20:38.897
BROADLY WRITTEN BY AN HR.

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:39.931
CONSULTANT RIGHT. HOW WOULD YOU

02:20:39.998 --> 02:20:42.700
GET OUT EVEN SO EVEN A WHY YOU

02:20:42.767 --> 02:20:43.301
THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA TO

02:20:43.368 --> 02:20:44.536
HAVE PRIVATE COMPANIES DO THAT

02:20:44.602 --> 02:20:46.905
AND THEN BE EVEN IF THEY DID

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:48.373
HOW THE LEGISLATURE REVIEW. WE

02:20:48.439 --> 02:20:50.708
HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THE-

02:20:50.775 --> 02:20:52.377
EIGHT TRILLION SOCIAL MEDIA

02:20:52.443 --> 02:20:53.978
POSTINGS AND SALE YOU SHOULD

02:20:54.045 --> 02:20:55.647
HAVE GRABBED THIS ONE MAGICIAN

02:20:55.713 --> 02:20:57.248
AND GRAB THAT ONE. YEAH I KNOW

02:20:57.315 --> 02:21:00.151
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND I AND-

02:21:00.218 --> 02:21:01.152
IT'S SOMETHING I'VE BY STRUGGLE

02:21:01.219 --> 02:21:02.353
WITH I MEAN THAT'S WHY I SORT

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:03.922
OF BROUGHT IN THE POLICY

02:21:03.988 --> 02:21:05.723
SECONDARILY THIS STARTED OFF AS

02:21:05.790 --> 02:21:06.858
A BILL JUST APPLYING FIRST

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:08.526
AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES TO THE

02:21:08.593 --> 02:21:10.728
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES. BUT I

02:21:10.795 --> 02:21:12.697
GET YOU KNOW WHY A LOT OF MY

02:21:12.764 --> 02:21:14.499
COLLEAGUES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

02:21:14.566 --> 02:21:16.000
THE ABUSES THAT WERE SEEN

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:18.670
RIGHT- THEN IF YOU TALK TO THAT

02:21:18.736 --> 02:21:19.938
THE TECH COMPANY THE SOCIAL

02:21:20.004 --> 02:21:21.272
MEDIA COMES A SAY WHAT WE HAVE

02:21:21.339 --> 02:21:23.208
POLICIES THE PROBLEM IS NOBODY

02:21:23.274 --> 02:21:24.809
REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE. I

02:21:24.876 --> 02:21:25.810
MEAN THEY CAN READ A MINUTE I

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:26.444
DON'T THINK THEY REALLY

02:21:26.511 --> 02:21:29.180
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY'RE EVEN

02:21:29.247 --> 02:21:30.882
APPLIED OR ENFORCED RIGHT. AND

02:21:30.949 --> 02:21:32.250
SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE I TRIED

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:33.484
TO GET YEAH I'M TRYING TO.

02:21:33.551 --> 02:21:35.420
THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE. IF YOU

02:21:35.486 --> 02:21:37.755
WILL BY SAYING LOOK I THINK WE

02:21:37.822 --> 02:21:39.324
NEED FREE SPEECH PROTECTIONS.

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:40.758
WE NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO

02:21:40.825 --> 02:21:43.661
SPEAK FREELY- ON THESE

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:44.896
PLATFORMS WHICH I THINK HAVE

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.698
BECOME THE PUBLIC SQUARE RIGHT

02:21:46.764 --> 02:21:48.800
THE NEW PUBLIC SQUARE. WELL

02:21:48.867 --> 02:21:50.869
THEN ALSO LIKE HAVING. YOU KNOW

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:52.904
SOMETHING AND I TO ME THE BEST

02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:54.138
WAY TO MAYBE DO HAS A SAY IN

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:55.840
THE REALM OF UNPROTECTED SPEECH

02:21:55.907 --> 02:21:56.708
WHERE THE WHERE THE COURTS HAVE

02:21:56.774 --> 02:21:58.243
ALREADY RULED THESE THINGS ARE

02:21:58.309 --> 02:22:00.378
UNPROTECTED OBSCENITY.

02:22:00.445 --> 02:22:01.546
INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE TRUE

02:22:01.613 --> 02:22:03.882
THREATS THE DEFAMATORY

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:05.984
STATEMENTS. THAT THEN PUT THE

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:07.619
ONUS ON THE BUSINESSES SAY HEY

02:22:07.685 --> 02:22:09.721
HAVE A POLICY THAT ADDRESSES.

02:22:09.787 --> 02:22:11.689
THOSE THINGS THAT. I THINK

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:14.025
THAT'S WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE

02:22:14.092 --> 02:22:14.626
CONCERNED THAT THERE ISN'T ONE

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:16.194
RIGHT. YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:17.128
THEN HOW DO YOU ENFORCE THAT

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:19.197
RIGHT AND WHO WHO AND FORCES

02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:20.198
THAT HE SAYS YOUR POLICY IS

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:21.799
GOOD ENOUGH. THE I THINK THOSE

02:22:21.866 --> 02:22:23.134
ARE THE CHALLENGES MISTER CHOW

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.903
HAS A BILL. TRYING TO DO THE

02:22:24.969 --> 02:22:27.338
SAME THING. THE OTHER WE

02:22:27.405 --> 02:22:31.442
PASSED. LAST WEEK- ED. MEMBER

02:22:31.509 --> 02:22:32.577
GABRIEL I THINK ALSO HAS A BILL

02:22:32.644 --> 02:22:33.945
WHERE HE'S TRYING TO DELPH THIS

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:36.881
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIGURE

02:22:36.948 --> 02:22:37.482
OUT WHAT IS THAT RIGHT POLICY

02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:40.218
IT'S TOUGH. ON THE FLIP SIDE.

02:22:40.285 --> 02:22:41.619
BUMPERS AMENDMENT. WE MIGHT WE

02:22:41.686 --> 02:22:44.455
MIGHT. WE MIGHT HAVE A FEELING

02:22:44.522 --> 02:22:45.657
THAT WE I DON'T THINK IT'S A

02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:48.326
GOOD POLICY FOR FIRST AMENDMENT

02:22:48.393 --> 02:22:49.794
TO APPLY I THINK THAT'S WHAT

02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:50.595
THE CHAIRMAN IS SAYING HE

02:22:50.662 --> 02:22:51.829
DOESN'T THINK IT'LL ULTIMATELY

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:52.931
BE GOOD POLICY FOR FIRST

02:22:52.997 --> 02:22:54.299
AMENDMENT TO APPLY TO SOCIAL

02:22:54.365 --> 02:22:56.267
MEDIA PLATFORMS. I DON'T THINK

02:22:56.334 --> 02:22:57.602
IT REALLY MATTERS WHETHER NOT

02:22:57.669 --> 02:22:58.336
YOU AGREE WITH THAT TO GET

02:22:58.403 --> 02:23:00.505
POLICY OR NOT IT'S REALLY ABOUT

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:02.340
DOES THE LAW REQUIRE IT AND IT

02:23:02.407 --> 02:23:03.908
SURE IT SURE LOOKS TO ME LIKE

02:23:03.975 --> 02:23:05.843
IT IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY

02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:07.879
THAT'S WHERE THIS IS GOING.

02:23:07.946 --> 02:23:10.081
BECAUSE THE PRINCIPLES IN PRUNE

02:23:10.148 --> 02:23:12.216
YARD ARE VERY MUCH OF THE

02:23:12.283 --> 02:23:14.719
PLUGGABLE YOU KNOW TO SOCIAL

02:23:14.786 --> 02:23:16.120
MEDIA PLATFORMS I DON'T HAVE

02:23:16.187 --> 02:23:17.422
BEEN LABOR THE POLICY PART IN

02:23:17.488 --> 02:23:19.190
ANYTHING EXCEPT I FIND THAT THE

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:22.026
LESSER OF THE COMPELLING RIGHT.

02:23:22.093 --> 02:23:23.161
I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY IS IT

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:25.029
WOULD END UP I THINK AS A

02:23:25.096 --> 02:23:27.231
PRACTICAL MATTER IT WOULD END

02:23:27.298 --> 02:23:31.269
UP WITH. I THINK THE GOVERNMENT

02:23:31.336 --> 02:23:33.304
DEVELOPING A POLICY FOR PRIVATE

02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:36.874
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY AND SO

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.676
THEN IT WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.611
HANDED DOWN POLICY TO BE IN.

02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:41.946
SECONDARILY I JUST DON'T SEE

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:43.381
HOW THAT WOULD EVER BE ENFORCED

02:23:43.448 --> 02:23:44.682
BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:47.051
BROAD ENOUGH AND WHAT YOU KNOW

02:23:47.118 --> 02:23:48.186
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS

02:23:48.252 --> 02:23:49.620
OF WHAT'S FAIR AND WHAT'S NOT

02:23:49.687 --> 02:23:51.456
FAIR WHAT'S UP ON AS MUCH NOT

02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.391
OPEN AND NOT OPEN. SO I WOULD I

02:23:53.458 --> 02:23:54.625
WOULD JUST SAY IS A PRIME I

02:23:54.692 --> 02:23:55.593
JUST DON'T SEE HOW THAT COULD

02:23:55.660 --> 02:23:57.662
EVER BOTH FROM A SORT OF

02:23:57.729 --> 02:23:59.163
PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT REALLY

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:00.131
MORE SO FROM A PRACTICAL

02:24:00.198 --> 02:24:01.332
STANDPOINT HOW THAT COULD WORK

02:24:01.399 --> 02:24:02.500
BUT I WANT TO GET INTO THE WHAT

02:24:02.567 --> 02:24:03.901
I THINK IS MORE COMPELLING

02:24:03.968 --> 02:24:06.270
ABOUT THIS OKAY. BECAUSE THERE

02:24:06.337 --> 02:24:08.172
THERE HAS BEEN SUCH AS- BAD

02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:12.610
CHANGE IN OUR LIFETIMES AS TO

02:24:12.677 --> 02:24:14.045
HOW WORK HOW THE PUBLIC IS

02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:17.915
COMMUNICATED WITH BOTH BY THE.

02:24:17.982 --> 02:24:19.350
GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE PARTIES-

02:24:19.417 --> 02:24:21.219
AND TYPICALLY. IN FIRST. CASES

02:24:21.285 --> 02:24:22.553
RIGHT THE LEVEL OF REVIEW IS

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:24.288
SORT OF WHAT. DETERMINES THE

02:24:24.355 --> 02:24:26.224
OUTCOME FOR EXAMPLE TIME PLACE

02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:28.259
AND MANNER. WE HAVE A VERY LOW

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:29.060
LEVEL REVIEW BECAUSE WE AGREE

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:30.895
OF THE GOVERNMENT. AT THE-

02:24:30.962 --> 02:24:33.731
CAMP. REQUIRE PEOPLE TO HAVE A

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.566
PERMIT FOR PARADE THANK WE-

02:24:35.633 --> 02:24:36.834
REGRET THAT WE SHOULDN'T DO

02:24:36.901 --> 02:24:37.935
PARADES THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS

02:24:38.002 --> 02:24:39.037
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SO

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.438
YOU DO THAT IF THEY HAVE PARKS

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:41.639
YOU HAVE TO GET A PERMIT FOR A

02:24:41.706 --> 02:24:43.141
PART. AGAIN BECAUSE WE

02:24:43.207 --> 02:24:44.208
UNDERSTAND THERE'S- WE CAN

02:24:44.275 --> 02:24:46.177
DISCRIMINATE HOW TO HAND OUT

02:24:46.244 --> 02:24:47.712
THE PERMITS. WHEN WE- LET IT

02:24:47.779 --> 02:24:49.347
GET THAT WEEK WE AGREE WE

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:50.114
COLLECTIVELY AGREE THAT YOU CAN

02:24:50.181 --> 02:24:51.416
HAVE YOU HAVE TO PROTEST FOR A

02:24:51.482 --> 02:24:53.351
PROPOSAL PART. OF A PARTY AT A

PARK OR SOMETHING OF THAT

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:55.586
NATURE. IN SORT OF IN THE

02:24:55.653 --> 02:24:58.456
MIDDLE. IS IN A CONTACT WE

02:24:58.523 --> 02:24:59.857
AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME

REGULATION HAS ON. CAN'T YELL

02:25:02.060 --> 02:25:04.562
FIRE IN A CROWDED ELEVATOR YOU

02:25:04.629 --> 02:25:11.002
CAN'T INCITE VIOLENCE. IN THE.

02:25:11.069 --> 02:25:11.602
MOST RESTRICTIVE IS OPINION.

02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:12.170
GOVERNMENT WE DON'T WANT WE

02:25:12.236 --> 02:25:12.837
COLLECT WE DON'T THE GOVERNMENT

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:13.604

02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:19.477
ALMOST IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:20.645
GOVERNMENT ENDS UP EXPRESSING

02:25:20.711 --> 02:25:22.547
OPINIONS. HE GETS IT AND GOES

02:25:22.613 --> 02:25:23.714
COURT CORNER OR WHERE THEY

02:25:23.781 --> 02:25:25.183
EXCLUDE SOMEONE'S APPARENT

02:25:25.249 --> 02:25:26.784
RACISM IS BEING RIGHT BECAUSE

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.653
IT'S- IT'S THE IDEA BEHIND IT

02:25:28.719 --> 02:25:29.487
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:32.223
SHOULDN'T. HAVE A PREFERRED

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:35.760
OPINION WE- TYPICALLY.

02:25:35.827 --> 02:25:39.097
OVERWHELMINGLY NEGATIVELY

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:40.531
FORMALLY PUSHED BACK ON- SOCIAL

02:25:40.598 --> 02:25:44.602
MEDIA. COMPANIES ARE PRIVATE

02:25:44.669 --> 02:25:47.972
RIGHT THEY HAVE THEY CAN KIND

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:51.642
OF INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE. IF AND

02:25:51.709 --> 02:25:53.478
THEN WE AS THE PUBLIC HAVE THE

02:25:53.544 --> 02:25:56.013
RIGHT TO TURN IT OFF. OR NOT

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.015
YOU HAVE AN ACCOUNT. EVERYBODY

02:25:58.082 --> 02:26:00.218
CHOOSES HAVE AN ACCOUNT. RIGHT

02:26:00.284 --> 02:26:01.452
OR THEY CAN CHOOSE HOW MUCH

02:26:01.519 --> 02:26:02.887
TIME THEY SPEND THE DAY YOU

02:26:02.954 --> 02:26:04.822
KNOW. SCROLLING THROUGH THAT'S

02:26:04.889 --> 02:26:06.824
UP TO ALL OF US WOULD BE ZERO

02:26:06.891 --> 02:26:08.025
MINUTES TODAY COULD BE SOME

02:26:08.092 --> 02:26:10.128
PEOPLE ON IT EIGHT TEN HOURS WE

02:26:10.194 --> 02:26:12.630
KNOW THAT- BUT I DO THINK

02:26:12.697 --> 02:26:15.233
THAT'S A- WHY. NOT THE FIRST

02:26:15.299 --> 02:26:16.667
MINUTE GETS A GOVERNMENT

02:26:16.734 --> 02:26:20.505
CONTACT CONTACT. WHEREAS

02:26:20.571 --> 02:26:23.574
PRIVATE PARTY CONTACT WITH. IS

02:26:23.641 --> 02:26:24.976
DIFFERENT IN MANY MANY WAYS NOT

02:26:25.042 --> 02:26:26.277
LEAST OF WHICH IS WE CAN GET

02:26:26.344 --> 02:26:28.045
AWAY FROM IT AND WHEN YOU CAN'T

02:26:28.112 --> 02:26:29.714
GET AWAY FROM GOVERNMENT ACTION.

02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:30.548
GOVERNMENT IS PERFORMING

02:26:30.615 --> 02:26:32.150
CERTAIN CERTAIN FUNCTIONS ONLY

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:35.853
GOVERNMENT. DOES AS OPPOSED TO

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:36.854
WHAT THIS PRIVATE COMPANIES

02:26:36.921 --> 02:26:38.623
DOING WHICH IS IT'S IN SOME WAY

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:42.193
DISSEMINATING INFORMATION. BUT

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:43.828
BECAUSE IT'S BEING MORE

02:26:43.895 --> 02:26:47.798
SUCCESSFUL IN SOME WAYS AND BY

02:26:47.865 --> 02:26:49.433
SIX SEVEN FIVE I IS LOOKING.

02:26:49.500 --> 02:26:51.235
DOES IT MEAN IN MY VIEW THAT MR

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:52.803
SHOULD BE HELD THAT THAT SHOULD

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:53.404
BE HELD TO DIFFERENT STANDARDS

02:26:53.471 --> 02:26:57.008
AND- LET'S GO BACK FOR A TIME.

02:26:57.074 --> 02:26:59.243
BACK BEFORE YOUR AND MY TIME.

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:01.045
THERE WERE THREE MAJOR NEWS

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:03.648
CHANNELS RIGHT WALTER CRONKITE

02:27:03.714 --> 02:27:05.883
TO OTHERS AND PROBABLY 99% OF

02:27:05.950 --> 02:27:08.085
AMERICANS GET THEIR NEWS FROM

02:27:08.152 --> 02:27:10.054
ONE OF THOSE THREE CHANNELS.

02:27:10.121 --> 02:27:11.822
BUT JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS THE

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:13.090
PREFERRED METHOD OF VIEWING

02:27:13.157 --> 02:27:14.759
DIDN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAD

02:27:14.825 --> 02:27:17.028
DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND THEY

02:27:17.094 --> 02:27:21.499
HAVE TO HEAR TO. A GREAT. THAT

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:23.935
I DON'T BELIEVE SO I MEAN. AND

02:27:24.001 --> 02:27:25.469
AGAIN I WAS BEFORE MY TIME

02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:26.170
RIGHT DID YOU WE DID GO TO LAW

02:27:26.237 --> 02:27:27.471
SCHOOL AFTER THAT THEY DIDN'T

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:29.040
HAVE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEY

02:27:29.106 --> 02:27:30.007
DIDN'T HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS

02:27:30.074 --> 02:27:31.309
EIGHT HERE TOO BECAUSE FOR

02:27:31.375 --> 02:27:32.777
WHATEVER REASON EVERYBODY TURN

TO THEM FOR NEWS RIGHT ON THE

02:27:35.213 --> 02:27:36.080
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS AN

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:38.149
ISSUE OF THOSE NEWS COMPANIES

02:27:38.216 --> 02:27:40.117
EXCLUDING VIEWERS AND SAYING.

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:43.154

02:27:50.995 --> 02:27:52.396

02:32:10.688 --> 02:32:12.857
ALL HAVE BIASES NOW IN A WAY

02:32:12.923 --> 02:32:14.425
THAT PROBABLY DIDN'T EXIST

02:32:14.492 --> 02:32:16.694
FIFTY YEARS AGO. MAYBE TEN

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:19.230
YEARS AGO. BUT THAT ALSO GOES

02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:21.465
TO THEIR CREDIBILITY. PEOPLE

02:32:21.532 --> 02:32:24.768
CAN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:25.402
GOING TO GIVE THAT NEWS STORY

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:28.506
THE- I'M VIEWING THAT THROUGH

02:32:28.572 --> 02:32:30.007
THE FACT THAT THIS CABLE NEWS

02:32:30.074 --> 02:32:31.609
CHANNEL WHICH HAS A BIAS IN

02:32:31.675 --> 02:32:33.744
THIS CERTAIN AREA. THEY WAY

02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:36.614
OUT. SUPPOSED CREDIBILITY SAME

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:39.550
WITH SOCIAL MEDIA T. YOU SAID

02:32:39.617 --> 02:32:40.618
WE ALL AGREE THE BAR IS VERY

02:32:40.684 --> 02:32:42.653
LOW SO WE CAN GO ON THERE AND

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:45.356
SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. ANY PERSON

02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:46.657
COMPOSED ANY CRAZY THING ON

02:32:46.724 --> 02:32:48.993
HERE. AND HOW DO I KNOW IT'S

02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:50.761
TRUE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE- ALL

02:32:50.828 --> 02:32:53.097
THAT OUT WHEN WE LOOK AT SOCIAL

02:32:53.163 --> 02:32:57.101
MEDIA THE VERY LOW BAR. YEAH SO

02:32:57.167 --> 02:32:58.335
I MEAN WHAT I WOULD SAY IN

02:32:58.402 --> 02:32:59.737
RESPONSE THAT IS ONE THE

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.639
CALIFORNIA CASE LAW DISAGREES

02:33:01.705 --> 02:33:03.607
WITH YOU THE YES IT DOES APPLY

02:33:03.674 --> 02:33:05.209
NOT JUST THE GOVERNMENT. BUT

02:33:05.276 --> 02:33:06.510
ALSO IT DOES APPLY TO PRIVATE

02:33:06.577 --> 02:33:08.979
ACTORS. AND THEN I WOULD SAY

02:33:09.046 --> 02:33:10.381
THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:12.283
CABLE NEWS SHOWS. AND SOCIAL

02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:13.951
MEDIA CABLE NEWS SHOWS HAVE

02:33:14.018 --> 02:33:14.785
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER THEIR

02:33:14.852 --> 02:33:16.987
CONTENT. THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE

02:33:17.054 --> 02:33:19.924
GOING TO BROADCAST THIS SHOW.

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.258
ALL THESE THINGS WHEREAS ON

02:33:21.325 --> 02:33:22.893
SOCIAL MEDIA IT'S COMPLETELY

02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.662
GENERATED BY USERS USERS ARE

02:33:24.728 --> 02:33:25.863
THE ONES WHO GENERATE THE

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:27.331
CONTENT. AND I THINK THAT IS A

02:33:27.398 --> 02:33:29.033
PRETTY DIFFERENT DISTINCTION

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:30.334
OKAY SO I'M AND THEN IF YOU

02:33:30.401 --> 02:33:31.335
START SAYING WELL NO YOU CAN'T

02:33:31.402 --> 02:33:32.970
USE THAT YEAH I'M INVITING YOU

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:34.638
ON TO COME AND SPEAK IN. AND

02:33:34.705 --> 02:33:36.840
CREATE THE CONTENT. BUT NOW I'M

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:37.908
GOING TO GET IN THE BUSINESS OF

02:33:37.975 --> 02:33:39.577
CONTENT AND SAY NO IF I CAN'T

02:33:39.643 --> 02:33:41.812
HAVE YOU- YOU SPEAKING BECAUSE

02:33:41.879 --> 02:33:43.047
I DON'T THIS DOESN'T MEET MY

02:33:43.113 --> 02:33:44.982
POLICY RIGHT OR WHATEVER RIGHT.

02:33:45.049 --> 02:33:45.883
THAT'S WHERE IT'S A LITTLE BIT

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:47.785
DIFFERENT FROM LIKE THE- THIS

02:33:47.851 --> 02:33:49.320
REGIONAL CABLE NEWS. AND I

02:33:49.386 --> 02:33:51.889
AGREED TO MEND THE DEVOLUTION

02:33:51.956 --> 02:33:53.457
OF MEDIA. OVER TIME IS WHAT IS

02:33:53.524 --> 02:33:54.758
KIND OF LED US TO THIS POINT IN

02:33:54.825 --> 02:33:56.527
THE FIRST PLACE NOBODY. SEE

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.162
SOMEONE AS AN OBJECT THERE IS

02:33:58.228 --> 02:34:00.631
NO WALTER CRONKITE. YEAH THAT

02:34:00.698 --> 02:34:04.268
YOUR PEOPLE. DO AS AN OBJECTIVE.

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:06.203
OBSERVER FACT YOU KNOW JUST

02:34:06.270 --> 02:34:08.906
GIVING THE FACTS ANYMORE RIGHT

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:11.875
SO AND SO PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO.

02:34:11.942 --> 02:34:13.344
OTHER AVENUES FOR OUR SON I

02:34:13.410 --> 02:34:15.279
WOULD ALSO SAY. I DON'T KNOW

02:34:15.346 --> 02:34:17.147
THE CALIFORNIA SPORTIST AND I

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:18.582
ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT SOME NOT

02:34:18.649 --> 02:34:22.119
OPINING ON REALLY. RIGHT BUT

02:34:22.186 --> 02:34:23.520
TOMORROW WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO

02:34:23.587 --> 02:34:26.357
MY POINT ON ON SOCCER BURKE IS.

02:34:26.423 --> 02:34:28.292
THE SO HE'S A PRIVATE ET TO

02:34:28.359 --> 02:34:29.593
WHATEVER EXTENT HE'S GOT A

02:34:29.660 --> 02:34:30.594
VIEWPOINT WOULD WOULDN'T YOU

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:34.365
AGREE IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN.

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:39.536
A. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. ACTIONS

02:34:39.603 --> 02:34:41.372
WHO IS ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE

02:34:41.438 --> 02:34:44.308
GOVERNMENT. YEAH HE'S NOT A

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:45.342
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL RIGHT

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:47.645
YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT AGAIN I JUST

02:34:47.711 --> 02:34:49.513
LIKE THIS CASE LAWS SAID IT

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:50.914
DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE THIS CAN

02:34:50.981 --> 02:34:52.216
APPLY WHEN CERTAIN PRINCIPLES

02:34:52.282 --> 02:34:53.817
ARE MET AND I AND I AND IN SOME

02:34:53.884 --> 02:34:55.185
RESPECT THEY ARE A VICTIM OF

02:34:55.252 --> 02:34:57.688
THEIR OWN SUCCESS. IF YOU WILL

02:34:57.755 --> 02:34:59.223
BECAUSE IT NOW HAS BECOME SO

02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:01.625
INFLUENTIAL. AND I THINK WE

02:35:01.692 --> 02:35:02.960
WOULD ALL AGREE THAT MAN STUFF

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:04.595
THAT IS SAID ON FACEBOOK AND

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:06.163
TWITTER AND- THAT'S WHERE A LOT

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:07.498
OF PEOPLE AGAIN INFORMATION IT

02:35:07.564 --> 02:35:09.466
LITERALLY INFLUENCES OUTCOMES

02:35:09.533 --> 02:35:10.100
IT LITERALLY INFLUENCES

02:35:10.167 --> 02:35:12.536
ELECTIONS. BOARD ABOUT BOTS AND

02:35:12.603 --> 02:35:13.837
INTERFERENCE BECAUSE PEOPLE

02:35:13.904 --> 02:35:15.372
COULD PUT FAKE STUFF ON THERE

02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:18.842
RIGHT AND- THAT RILES PEOPLE UP.

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:20.444
WE OBVIOUSLY SEE THAT IT HAS

02:35:20.511 --> 02:35:21.712
BECOME SO INFLUENTIAL IN

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:23.213
AFFECTS PUBLIC LIFE SO MUCH

02:35:23.280 --> 02:35:25.049
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT TUNE

02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:25.616
YARDS SAYS IS ANOTHER FACTOR

02:35:25.683 --> 02:35:27.584
THAT YOU. WHEN THIS IS

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.019
AFFECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST

02:35:29.086 --> 02:35:31.455
SO MUCH THAT YES IN FACT. THIS

02:35:31.522 --> 02:35:34.858
CAN BECOME A PUBLIC FORUM- THAT

02:35:34.925 --> 02:35:36.193
IS SUBJECT TO FIRST AMENDMENT

02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:39.029
PROTECTIONS YEAH TAX DOLLARS

02:35:39.096 --> 02:35:40.898
ARE CREATING. A SOCIAL MEDIA

02:35:40.964 --> 02:35:42.199
COMPANY NOT FUNDING THE SOCIAL

02:35:42.266 --> 02:35:44.234
NO CAMPAIGN AGAIN IN A WAY THAT

02:35:44.301 --> 02:35:45.402
THERE FOR ME THEY WERE THERE

02:35:45.469 --> 02:35:46.737
FORMING THE NEW THEY DEVELOP A

02:35:46.804 --> 02:35:49.873
SHOPPING CENTER EITHER. RIGHT

02:35:49.940 --> 02:35:51.241
HOW MAY BE I DON'T KNOW FOR

02:35:51.308 --> 02:35:52.609
SURE ABOUT THAT. I WOULD STILL

02:35:52.676 --> 02:35:55.579
SUGGEST. KIND OF APPLES AND

02:35:55.646 --> 02:35:56.914
ORANGES BUT LET'S TAKE AWAY

02:35:56.980 --> 02:35:58.682
THAT SHOPPING CENTER EXAMPLES

02:35:58.749 --> 02:36:01.318
IS JUST THAT THERE'S NOT.

02:36:01.385 --> 02:36:03.353
THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT DOLLARS

02:36:03.420 --> 02:36:04.922
GOING INTO FORM A BODY THAT'S

02:36:04.988 --> 02:36:06.957
PERFORMING GOVERNMENT ACTIONS

02:36:07.024 --> 02:36:09.059
THAT WOULD THEN BRING IN. THE

02:36:09.126 --> 02:36:11.628
FIRST MINUTE AND ONE REASON BY

02:36:11.695 --> 02:36:13.197
THE WAY ONE REASON WHY I THINK.

02:36:13.263 --> 02:36:15.299
THEY'RE GOING AFTER FOR EXAMPLE

02:36:15.365 --> 02:36:18.035
HEATH SPEECH HARPER OR SEEMS

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:19.169
LIKE A MORE CONCERTED EFFORT

02:36:19.236 --> 02:36:20.504
FOR BOX IN A MORE CONCERTED

02:36:20.571 --> 02:36:23.407
EFFORT. IS BECAUSE CONSUMERS

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:26.877
HAVE ASKED FOR THEY HAVE SAID

02:36:26.944 --> 02:36:27.544
WERE CHALLENGING THE

02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:30.114
CREDIBILITY. OF WHAT WERE YOU

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:32.783
SEEN ON HERE. AND WE DON'T WANT

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:34.918
TO KEEP USING THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:36:34.985 --> 02:36:37.855
PLATFORM. IF THEY TURN A BLIND

02:36:37.921 --> 02:36:39.156
EYE TO HATE SPEECH OR THEY TURN

02:36:39.223 --> 02:36:41.091
A BLIND EYE TO BOTS SO IT'S

02:36:41.158 --> 02:36:43.594
ACTUALLY BEING. LARGELY MARKET

02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:45.863
DRIVEN THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE

02:36:45.929 --> 02:36:48.766
GOING TO. QUIT CLICKING ON THIS

02:36:48.832 --> 02:36:51.135
SITE IF THEY DON'T DO SOMETHING

02:36:51.201 --> 02:36:52.870
ABOUT THESE THINGS. ISN'T IT

02:36:52.936 --> 02:36:54.738
IT'S NOT NICE TO THE GOVERNMENT

02:36:54.805 --> 02:36:56.974
ST HAVE A POLICY ON IT. BECAUSE

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:58.175
THEY THEY A THEY PROBABLY

02:36:58.242 --> 02:36:59.943
ALREADY DO AND BE I KNOW HOW

02:37:00.010 --> 02:37:00.878
FACT THAT THAT THAT THAT THIS

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:03.213
IS IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE IN

02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:05.682
EFFECT. IN AND OF ITSELF RIGHT.

02:37:05.749 --> 02:37:07.351
BUT I MEAN. I JUST THINK IT'S

02:37:07.417 --> 02:37:08.519
IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER I

02:37:08.585 --> 02:37:10.354
MEAN ACCORDING TO THE CHAIRMAN.

02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.321
THERE AND THEY ARE NOT

02:37:11.388 --> 02:37:13.157
RESPONDING TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:15.926
WANTING THEM TO DO RIGHT.

02:37:15.993 --> 02:37:17.127
THIRTY NINE THEY ARE WILL NOT

02:37:17.194 --> 02:37:18.328
GO THERE AND THEY ARE AND I

02:37:18.395 --> 02:37:20.364
MEAN AND THEY KIND OF. IT

02:37:20.430 --> 02:37:21.932
DEPENDS ON IT DEPENDS ON YOUR

02:37:21.999 --> 02:37:23.700
PERSPECTIVE I THINK I THINK

02:37:23.767 --> 02:37:24.735
THREE I GUESS WHAT I'D SAY IS I

02:37:24.802 --> 02:37:26.370
THINK NOW WHY WOULD I AGREE

02:37:26.436 --> 02:37:27.104
THAT THEY DISCUSSION ITS

02:37:27.171 --> 02:37:28.906
CONSUMER FOR HIS REYES CONSUMER

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:31.608
DRIVEN IS WHAT'S BUSINESSES

02:37:31.675 --> 02:37:32.576
RESPOND TO CONSUMERS. RIGHT NOW

02:37:32.643 --> 02:37:33.644
SO THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE

02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:34.845
HOW EFFECTIVE THEY'RE BEING OUT

02:37:34.912 --> 02:37:36.580
IT IS DEBATABLE. BUT JUST THE

02:37:36.647 --> 02:37:38.615
FACT THAT. THEY'RE STARTING TO

02:37:38.682 --> 02:37:40.117
DO IT AND STARTING TO ADDRESS

02:37:40.184 --> 02:37:41.952
IT. I THINK IN A MORE PHOTO

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:43.020
MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY KNOW MORE

02:37:43.086 --> 02:37:45.355
FOCUSED AND DIRECT MANNER. IS

02:37:45.422 --> 02:37:49.326
BECAUSE CONSUMERS- HAVE ASKED

02:37:49.393 --> 02:37:52.529
FOR THAT. SO YOU KNOW. AND I

02:37:52.596 --> 02:37:53.931
WOULD JUST REACH OUT IS AND

02:37:53.997 --> 02:37:55.933
WITH THE SAME. AND FREE SPEECH

02:37:55.999 --> 02:37:57.868
IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH MARKET

02:37:57.935 --> 02:38:00.404
CONSUMERS- AND SUPPLY AND

02:38:00.470 --> 02:38:01.538
DEMAND IT'S ACTUALLY FREE

02:38:01.605 --> 02:38:03.040
SPEECH. IS COMPLETELY

02:38:03.106 --> 02:38:04.875
CONSISTENT WITH THAT. ACT WHICH

02:38:04.942 --> 02:38:06.210
IMPORTANT BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY

02:38:06.276 --> 02:38:10.480
IS WHY I THINK. THIS WOULD END

02:38:10.547 --> 02:38:11.882
UP NOT. THAT WOULD HAVE AGAINST

02:38:11.949 --> 02:38:13.650
YOUR THIS. WHAT YOU'RE

02:38:13.717 --> 02:38:16.453
PROPOSING BECAUSE THE MARKET IS.

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:18.989
HAVING A CHANGE IN A WAY THAT

02:38:19.056 --> 02:38:20.123
IT'S TELLING THEM TO HAVE A

02:38:20.190 --> 02:38:23.393
POLICY MANUAL FIRST FOR EXAMPLE.

02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:26.063
THE WAY. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:38:26.129 --> 02:38:27.431
STILL HAVE REGULATION ON EITHER

02:38:27.497 --> 02:38:30.434
SIDE IS WHAT YOU'RE SAID REALLY

02:38:30.500 --> 02:38:31.902
TO TWO THIRTY IS. YEAH I MEAN

02:38:31.969 --> 02:38:33.136
YOU'RE KIND OF SAYING THAT I

02:38:33.203 --> 02:38:35.272
DON'T THINK THE POLICY WOULD BE

02:38:35.339 --> 02:38:38.475
IT'S THE RIGHT SCOPE FOR. US AS

02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:39.610
A LEGISLATORS TRYING TO

02:38:39.676 --> 02:38:41.578
DETERMINE WHAT POLICY SHOULD BE

02:38:41.645 --> 02:38:43.680
FOR A PRIVATE SOCIAL MEDIA. AND

02:38:43.747 --> 02:38:44.514
THEN FROM THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH

02:38:44.581 --> 02:38:46.516
FOR SOME. SO I THINK THAT THAT

02:38:46.583 --> 02:38:49.119
THAT I CAN GET THEM I THINK

02:38:49.186 --> 02:38:50.087
WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:38:50.153 --> 02:38:52.122
ISSUES I JUST I THINK EQUATING

02:38:52.189 --> 02:38:56.059
A SOCIAL MEDIA. COMPANY WITH

02:38:56.126 --> 02:38:56.660
THE GOVERNMENT. JUST BECAUSE A

02:38:56.727 --> 02:38:58.395
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE

02:38:58.462 --> 02:38:59.930
LOOKING AT. AND MY GUESS I

02:38:59.997 --> 02:39:01.164
DON'T KNOW THIS MY GUESS

02:39:01.231 --> 02:39:02.532
ACTUALLY IT'S PROBABLY EVEN IF

02:39:02.599 --> 02:39:03.533
THE LATTER AND ACTUALLY IS

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.735
PROBABLY LESS THAN THE THREE

02:39:04.801 --> 02:39:06.570
MAJOR NETWORKS BACK IN NINETEEN

02:39:06.637 --> 02:39:07.838
THE FIFTIES OF THE FORTIES

02:39:07.905 --> 02:39:09.806
ACTUALLY. JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:39:09.873 --> 02:39:11.341
THEY'RE REALLY ONLY THREE AND

02:39:11.408 --> 02:39:13.777
NOW SYSTEM IS COMPETING WITH.

02:39:13.844 --> 02:39:16.079
SMALLER BUT STILL NEWSPAPERS

02:39:16.146 --> 02:39:17.748
STILL CABLE NEWS CHANNEL STILL.

02:39:17.814 --> 02:39:19.483
SO THE PERCENTAGE OF WOULD

02:39:19.549 --> 02:39:20.517
STILL PROBABLY BE LOVE

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:24.521
ACTUALLY. BUT ANY OF THAT I

02:39:24.588 --> 02:39:25.255
JUST I DON'T SEE IT AS- THE

02:39:25.322 --> 02:39:27.124
ANYBODY COULD CONFUSE MARK

02:39:27.190 --> 02:39:28.458
ZUCKERBERG FOR EXAMPLE AS A

02:39:28.525 --> 02:39:30.127
GOVERNMENT ACTORS- IS IT

02:39:30.193 --> 02:39:32.896
BECAUSE SOMEBODY. WE SHOULD BE.

02:39:32.963 --> 02:39:34.865
PUT RIGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:37.367
WE GET PUT ON THE CEO OF.

02:39:37.434 --> 02:39:39.336
FACEBOOK KEEP TO THEMSELVES.

02:39:39.403 --> 02:39:41.071
RIGHT WE PUT GOVERNMENT PEOPLE

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:42.873
THERE ARE WE- WE GO TO GET A

02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:45.776
LICENSE ONLY WITH US AND WE- WE

02:39:45.842 --> 02:39:49.579
EXPECT TO NOT HAVE. CERTAIN

02:39:49.646 --> 02:39:50.547
THINGS ARE CURRENTLY WE DON'T

02:39:50.614 --> 02:39:52.482
HAVE TO SIGN SOMETHING SENIR

02:39:52.549 --> 02:39:53.383
CERTAIN RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OR

02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:54.451
POLITICAL BELIEFS OR OPINIONS

02:39:54.518 --> 02:39:56.153
BELIEFS WHEN WE GET A DRIVER'S

02:39:56.219 --> 02:39:56.653
LICENSE REALLY WOULD BE

02:39:56.720 --> 02:39:58.555
OFFENDED BY THAT BECAUSE IT IS

02:39:58.622 --> 02:39:59.890
THE GOVERNMENT SORT OF TELLING

02:39:59.957 --> 02:40:00.524
US WELL WE'LL GIVE YOU DRIVERS

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.159
RIGHT. BUT IN EXCHANGE YOU GOT

02:40:02.225 --> 02:40:03.794
TO DO THIS AND THAT'S WORKING

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.162
IN THAT IN SOME SMALL SENSE IS

02:40:05.228 --> 02:40:06.296
WHY THE RATE IS BY THE FIRST

02:40:06.363 --> 02:40:08.031
MINISTER AND I JUST DON'T SEE

02:40:08.098 --> 02:40:10.267
THOSE SAME THINGS WHEN IT COMES

02:40:10.334 --> 02:40:13.737
TO A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY THAT.

02:40:13.804 --> 02:40:16.340
WOULD TO RACKED. JUST BECAUSE A

02:40:16.406 --> 02:40:17.874
SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE

02:40:17.941 --> 02:40:19.476
OF PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA WE'VE

02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:22.112
NOW GOT TO MAKE THIS EQUATE

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:22.679
THEM WITH THE UNITED STATES

02:40:22.746 --> 02:40:25.782
GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS MUCH

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:27.918
BIGGER AND HAS MUCH BROADER

02:40:27.985 --> 02:40:30.821
RESPONSIBILITIES. AND THINGS

02:40:30.887 --> 02:40:31.989
THAT IT DOES TO INTERACT WITH

02:40:32.055 --> 02:40:34.157
OUR EVERYDAY LIFE IN A WAY THAT

02:40:34.224 --> 02:40:35.959
SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH WE CAN TURN

02:40:36.026 --> 02:40:37.394
OFF ANYTIME YOU WANT. CAN

02:40:37.461 --> 02:40:39.863
DELETE IT WE CANNOT GO ON THERE

02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.199
WE HAVE THE ULTIMATE SAY. WE

02:40:42.265 --> 02:40:42.899
DON'T KNOW IT WOULD ALWAYS

02:40:42.966 --> 02:40:44.267
UTILIZE OUR POWER WE AS A

02:40:44.334 --> 02:40:46.603
SOCIETY ON THAT TO JUST SAY NO

EXPLAIN TO WHY YOU'RE ASKING BE

02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:54.978
THOUGHTFUL I HOPE I HAVE BEEN-

02:40:55.045 --> 02:40:57.547
AS TO WHY I JUST DON'T SEE THE

02:40:57.614 --> 02:41:00.017
THAT A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY IS

02:41:00.083 --> 02:41:01.418
THE EQUIVALENT OF THE UNITED

02:41:01.485 --> 02:41:04.688
STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FIRST

02:41:04.755 --> 02:41:06.823

CERTAINLY ABOUT FOR THE BILL

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:24.541
THAT. REQUIRES I THINK A LOT OF

02:41:24.608 --> 02:41:27.044
INSIGHT AND IN CONVERSATION AND

02:41:27.110 --> 02:41:28.311
I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE

02:41:28.378 --> 02:41:28.912
ANALYSIS IN A THOROUGH

02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:31.314
ANALYSIS. THAT WAS DONE ON BOTH

02:41:31.381 --> 02:41:34.684
OF THE TWO MAJOR ITEMS. OTHER

02:41:34.751 --> 02:41:35.752
BEING BROUGHT FORWARD WITH THIS

02:41:35.819 --> 02:41:38.822
BILL- I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR OF

02:41:38.889 --> 02:41:40.023
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS BUT I

02:41:40.090 --> 02:41:41.491
ALSO DO THINK THAT. THE

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:43.026
PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT DOES

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:45.929
REQUIRE- THE DOCKING OF

02:41:45.996 --> 02:41:47.864
POLICIES AND MECHANISMS FOR

02:41:47.931 --> 02:41:50.600
ADDRESSING- THE MONTHLY PAAS

02:41:50.667 --> 02:41:52.636
CONTENTS IN AN UNPROTECTED

02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:54.905
SPEECH- IS SOMETHING THAT I

02:41:54.971 --> 02:41:56.673
THINK THAT IS BORN OUT. IN IN

02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:57.674
RECENT YEARS OR SOMETHING THAT

02:41:57.741 --> 02:42:01.111
I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED-

02:42:01.178 --> 02:42:05.315
AND SO- TO THAT END AND I I'M

02:42:05.382 --> 02:42:11.154
I'M GOING TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT.

02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:12.222
AT A MOTION HEARING OF COURSE.

02:42:12.289 --> 02:42:13.123
THE PLAN WOULD HAVE WITH IT'S

02:42:13.190 --> 02:42:14.458
ALWAYS A TO THE TUNE AUTHORED A-

02:42:14.524 --> 02:42:20.530
THEY- HOW THEY WANT TO PROCEED-

02:42:20.597 --> 02:42:21.765
UPON EMOTIONALLY MADE BUT I'D

02:42:21.832 --> 02:42:23.400
LIKE TO MAKE. THE MOST A MOTION

02:42:23.467 --> 02:42:26.069
DO WITH MEN'S AS RECOMMENDED BY

02:42:26.136 --> 02:42:29.873
COMMITTEE- AND TO BE CLEAR- AS

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:32.742
STATED IN THE ANALYSIS ON. THE

02:42:32.809 --> 02:42:35.745
TOP OF PAGE TEND TO DELETE LINE

02:42:35.812 --> 02:42:36.413
SIXTY NINE IN THE TEXT THE BILL

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:41.952
AND. I WAS FOR THIS SECTION OF

02:42:42.018 --> 02:42:43.386
THE BILL THAT MOST SEEM TO BE

02:42:43.453 --> 02:42:44.254
IN AGREEMENT WITH TO MOVE

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:47.324
FORWARD. WITH THE PARTY DEBATE

02:42:47.390 --> 02:42:48.792
WE'VE HAD ON THE FIRST SECTION

02:42:48.859 --> 02:42:50.060
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS AGREE ON

02:42:50.127 --> 02:42:51.161
EVERY SPECIAL WHEN IT COMES TO

02:42:51.228 --> 02:42:52.963
LEGAL MATTERS- BUT I DO THINK

02:42:53.029 --> 02:42:53.930
THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN AGREE

02:42:53.997 --> 02:42:55.532
THAT. OF THE PORTION OF THE

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:58.001
BILL THE THAT- THAT THE-

02:42:58.068 --> 02:43:00.070
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IS A

02:43:00.137 --> 02:43:03.173
SUGGESTED. SUPPORT OF- CAN

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.176
CONTINUE AND WE CAN STILL HAVE-

02:43:06.243 --> 02:43:07.677
CONTINUE DEBATE AND THE

02:43:07.744 --> 02:43:08.678
MOVEMENT FORWARD ON THAT ITEM

02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:10.413
SO THAT'S MY QUESTION THANK YOU

02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:12.082
SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THAT

02:43:12.149 --> 02:43:14.484
MOTION IS. TO PASS AS AMENDED

02:43:14.551 --> 02:43:17.888
IN THE AMENDMENT IS LISTED AT

02:43:17.954 --> 02:43:18.889
THE TOP OF PAGE TEN. WHICH

02:43:18.955 --> 02:43:19.956
WOULD BE IN THE BILL TO DELETE

02:43:20.023 --> 02:43:22.425
LINES SIX THROUGH NINE AND THEN

02:43:22.492 --> 02:43:22.959
RE LETTER THE SUBDIVISIONS

02:43:23.026 --> 02:43:25.695
ACCORDINGLY. TO HAVE A SECOND

02:43:25.762 --> 02:43:26.830
AND WE HAVE A SECOND THANK YOU.

02:43:26.897 --> 02:43:32.402
RIGHT. GONZALEZ- FIRST OF ALL

02:43:32.469 --> 02:43:33.837
THANK YOU I ACTUALLY THINK THIS

02:43:33.904 --> 02:43:36.439
IS IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS AND I

02:43:36.506 --> 02:43:39.109
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT-

02:43:39.176 --> 02:43:40.143
YOU KNOW WE COULD ALL TALK

02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:41.912
LEGAL THEORY IN CASE ON WE

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:43.146
DON'T KNOW RIGHT WHAT WOULD

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:45.448
HAPPEN BOTH IN IN A CALIFORNIA

02:43:45.515 --> 02:43:47.584
A CHALLENGE TO THIS LIKE ANY OF

02:43:47.651 --> 02:43:48.385
THE BILLS WE PASS WE DON'T KNOW

02:43:48.451 --> 02:43:50.887
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN- IN THE STATE

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:53.356
OR FEDERALLY- IF WE CREATE

02:43:53.423 --> 02:43:57.327
THIS. MY CONCERN IS THIS THESE

02:43:57.394 --> 02:43:58.895
TWO PORTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE

02:43:58.962 --> 02:43:59.996
WITH ANOTHER ONE ANOTHER I

02:44:00.063 --> 02:44:01.831
BELIEVE BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE

02:44:01.898 --> 02:44:03.700
WOULD HAVE A CHILLING EFFECT ON

02:44:03.767 --> 02:44:07.337
SELF REGULATION IF WE SAID

02:44:07.404 --> 02:44:08.405
THERE ARE FIRST AMENDMENT

02:44:08.471 --> 02:44:10.340
RIGHTS RIGHT NO I WOULD THINK

02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:13.043
FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- THE

02:44:13.109 --> 02:44:14.444
SOCIAL CLAPPED THAT SOCIAL

02:44:14.511 --> 02:44:16.313
MEDIA PLATFORMS WOULD WOULD

02:44:16.379 --> 02:44:17.714
REALLY CARE ON THE SITE

02:44:17.781 --> 02:44:22.485
ALLOWING ALL SPEECH- BECAUSE-

02:44:22.552 --> 02:44:24.521
IT'S EASIER THAN TRYING TO

02:44:24.588 --> 02:44:26.590
FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT EXACTLY-

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:27.591
SHOULD BE LIMITED AND I'LL GIVE

02:44:27.657 --> 02:44:29.192
YOU AN EXAMPLE AND PERHAPS MY

02:44:29.259 --> 02:44:31.895
OWN EXPERIENCES. IT IS NEARING

02:44:31.962 --> 02:44:33.263
WHAT YOU KNOW I I'M WORRIED

02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:35.298
ABOUT. IS THAT FREE SPEECH TO

02:44:35.365 --> 02:44:37.100
WRITE MY ADDRESS ON A SOCIAL

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:39.169
MEDIA PLATFORM. NOT ME FOR

02:44:39.236 --> 02:44:42.572
SOMEBODY ELSE AFTER EVERYONE MY

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:43.406
POST TO POST MY PERSONAL

02:44:43.473 --> 02:44:46.076
ADDRESS MAYBE YOU KNOW IS IT

02:44:46.142 --> 02:44:47.344
FREE SPEECH AFTER MY PERSONAL

02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:49.346
POST TO POST MY DAUGHTER'S

02:44:49.412 --> 02:44:51.781
PICTURE WHERE SHE WORKS WHERE

02:44:51.848 --> 02:44:55.085
SHE LIVES. MIGHT BE MIGHT BE

02:44:55.151 --> 02:44:57.721
FREE SPEECH BUT RIGHT NOW LET'S

02:44:57.787 --> 02:45:00.724
LEAVE- WE CAN TRY TO SOMETIMES

02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:01.858
SUCCESSFULLY SOMETIMES NOT

02:45:01.925 --> 02:45:03.326
SUCCESSFULLY GET THE MEDIA

02:45:03.393 --> 02:45:04.728
PLATFORMS TO TAKE THESE AND

02:45:04.794 --> 02:45:05.895
THESE ARE THINGS THAT HAVE

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:08.398
HAPPENED TO ME NOT ONCE. IT IN

02:45:08.465 --> 02:45:10.166
IN A ROUND OF NOT DIRECT

02:45:10.233 --> 02:45:13.136
THREATS BUT TRACKING PEOPLE WHO

02:45:13.203 --> 02:45:15.205
ARE CLEARLY UPSET IN IN RAGE

02:45:15.272 --> 02:45:17.907
WITH ME TO HAVE INFORMATION

02:45:17.974 --> 02:45:20.877
THAT COULD LEAD TO A THREAT. I

02:45:20.944 --> 02:45:26.216
DON'T KNOW IF- GIVING YOU KNOW.

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:27.951
BILLS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS ON

02:45:28.018 --> 02:45:30.954
A SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM- WHICH

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:32.355
HAS BECOME KIND OF THIS UNIQUE

02:45:32.422 --> 02:45:34.224
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO I TRULY

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.558
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:37.193
THIS BUT IT IT'S IT OTHERWISE

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.662
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE STARTING TO

02:45:38.728 --> 02:45:40.130
FINALLY GET TO A SITUATION ON

02:45:40.196 --> 02:45:41.631
SOCIAL MEDIA AND I'M TALKING AS

02:45:41.698 --> 02:45:43.066
AN ADULT AND YOU LOOK AT SOME

02:45:43.133 --> 02:45:44.200
OF THE STUFF THAT HAPPENS WITH

02:45:44.267 --> 02:45:45.368
KIDS WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT

02:45:45.435 --> 02:45:48.004
WOULD BE CONSIDERED ABSOLUTELY

02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:51.074
FREE SPEECH- I WOULD PREFER

02:45:51.141 --> 02:45:52.976
MORE REGULATION NOT LESS. AND

02:45:53.043 --> 02:45:55.278
SO. IN THIS PLATFORM I THINK

02:45:55.345 --> 02:45:57.047
IT'S HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE I THINK

02:45:57.113 --> 02:45:59.649
IT IS- VERY DANGEROUS. AND WE

02:45:59.716 --> 02:46:01.251
ARE IT'S BECOMING MORE

02:46:01.318 --> 02:46:02.919
DANGEROUS NOT LESS SO. WITH

02:46:02.986 --> 02:46:05.055
THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT- YOUR BILL

02:46:05.121 --> 02:46:06.156
IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT AM

02:46:06.222 --> 02:46:07.357
SUPPORTING OBVIOUSLY THE

02:46:07.424 --> 02:46:10.727
AMENDED VERSION TO. PROVIDE

02:46:10.794 --> 02:46:12.796
MORE CLARITY FOR CONSUMERS. NO

AND I APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN IT

02:46:14.497 --> 02:46:16.099
IT THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE IT

02:46:16.166 --> 02:46:18.868
IS YEAH MY I FACED A THREAT

02:46:18.935 --> 02:46:22.238
MYSELF- THIS YEAR TO. YOU- FROM

02:46:22.305 --> 02:46:28.511
AN ANGRY PERSON- AND YOU KNOW.

02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:30.313
THE CURRENT STATUS OF FIRST

02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:32.716
AMENDMENT LAWS IT INCITEMENT TO

02:46:32.782 --> 02:46:33.983
VIOLENCE OR TRUE THREATS ARE

02:46:34.050 --> 02:46:35.618
NOT PROTECTED SPEECH YOU KNOW

02:46:35.685 --> 02:46:37.921

02:46:37.987 --> 02:46:39.055
TO LIKE I SAID THREAD THE

02:46:39.122 --> 02:46:39.889
NEEDLE ON THIS BY SAYING LOOK

02:46:39.956 --> 02:46:41.458
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE RIGHT

02:46:41.524 --> 02:46:42.859
FOR PEOPLE TO SPEAK WHAT THEY

02:46:42.926 --> 02:46:44.394
BELIEVE IN WHAT THAT YOU KNOW

02:46:44.461 --> 02:46:45.428

02:46:45.495 --> 02:46:47.464
AND PUBLISH WHILE ALSO HAVING

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:48.732
SOMETHING THAT'S WHY I'M-

02:46:48.798 --> 02:46:50.066
ADDING THE SECOND COMPONENT

02:46:50.133 --> 02:46:51.601
THAT. I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES

02:46:51.668 --> 02:46:52.635
MY BILL DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

02:46:52.702 --> 02:46:54.704
OTHERS ARE DOING IS I'M DOING.

02:46:54.771 --> 02:46:56.740
BOTH THINGS. AND THAT'S WHY

02:46:56.806 --> 02:46:57.774

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:36.613
MOTION S. YES THE MOTION IS TO

02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:38.915
PASS THE BILL AS AMENDED AND

02:47:38.982 --> 02:47:40.150
THE AMENDMENT WOULD BE TO

02:47:40.216 --> 02:47:42.952
DELETE SECTION HEY SO STRIKE

02:47:43.019 --> 02:47:44.287
LINE SIXTY NINE WHICH IS

ESSENTIALLY SECTION HEY WHICH

02:47:46.189 --> 02:47:48.158
IS THE PART THAT SAYS THE

02:47:48.224 --> 02:47:49.959
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS WILL

02:47:50.026 --> 02:47:51.294
BECOME TRADITIONAL WILL BE

02:47:51.361 --> 02:47:53.630
TREATED AS TRADITIONAL FIRST

02:47:53.696 --> 02:47:55.799
AMENDMENT FORMS. AND IT LEAVES

02:47:55.865 --> 02:47:57.333
THE SECOND PIECE WHICH IS

02:47:57.400 --> 02:47:59.736
ASKING SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

02:47:59.803 --> 02:48:00.904
TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND BE

02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.305
CLEAR. ABOUT WHAT THOSE

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:05.742
POLICIES ARE. AND THAT'S WHAT

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:08.645
MY RECOMMENDATION IS OR WAS AND

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:09.646
THAT'S WHAT ACTUALLY AFTER MY

02:48:09.712 --> 02:48:11.448
DISCUSSION WITH MR GALLAGHER

02:48:11.514 --> 02:48:13.750
WHO WANTED THE BILL TO MOVE

02:48:13.817 --> 02:48:15.652
FORWARD THAT THAT WOULD BE.

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:17.153
WOOD BEEN ACCEPTABLE TO JUST

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:18.288
ONE WITH THE AMENDMENT IS ONE

02:48:18.354 --> 02:48:19.222
LITTLE CLARIFICATION IT WOULD

02:48:19.289 --> 02:48:21.324
JUST LEAVE THE POLICY IN THE

02:48:21.391 --> 02:48:23.526
BILL THAT MANDATES SOCIAL MEDIA

02:48:23.593 --> 02:48:26.162
COMPANIES TO HAVE A POLICY YES

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:28.131
ADDRESS SEEN ON PROTECTED FORMS

02:48:28.198 --> 02:48:30.733
OF SPEECH- THAT I LISTED

02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:39.008
EARLIER. OKAY THANK YOU SO OKAY.

02:48:39.075 --> 02:48:42.178
WE CLEAR BUT A MEASURE CLEAR

02:48:42.245 --> 02:48:46.616
BUT THE MOMENTS ARE. RIGHT JUST

02:48:46.683 --> 02:48:48.117
FOR MY COMMENTS I WANT TO BE

02:48:48.184 --> 02:48:49.719
CLEAR HERE AND SOMETHING THAT

02:48:49.786 --> 02:48:51.287
MR KILEY SAID AND I'M SORRY

02:48:51.354 --> 02:48:52.789
THAT THAT HE'S NOT HERE TO SEE

02:48:52.856 --> 02:48:54.157
THIS WAS ATTRIBUTING SOMETHING

02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:55.525
TO ME. AND I REALIZED THAT I

02:48:55.592 --> 02:48:57.794
WAS. IN EXACT IN MY SPEECH WHEN

02:48:57.861 --> 02:48:59.429
I WAS USING THE WORD WE I WAS

02:48:59.496 --> 02:49:00.830
NOT MEANING WE AS GOVERNMENT I

02:49:00.897 --> 02:49:02.899
WAS MEETING WE AS SOCIETY

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:04.067
CONTROLLING THESE BECAUSE I

02:49:04.133 --> 02:49:06.669
FIND THAT IF WHAT WE DO IS MY

02:49:06.736 --> 02:49:09.072
OBJECTION TO THIS IS. THE STATE

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:10.874
LEGISLATURE AFFIRMATIVELY SAYS

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:13.176
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ARE

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:16.446
IN FACT FIRST AMENDMENT FOR.

02:49:16.513 --> 02:49:18.815
THAT WE ARE NOW IS A GOVERNMENT

02:49:18.882 --> 02:49:21.985
WEIGHING IN ON WHAT THEY WHAT

02:49:22.051 --> 02:49:23.653
WE EXPECT ACTIONS WITH THOSE

02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:25.788
PLATFORMS TO BE ABLE TO DO. I

02:49:25.855 --> 02:49:27.490
THINK. I DON'T SEE THAT THERE'S

02:49:27.557 --> 02:49:30.193
A CHALLENGE WITH FREE SPEECH

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:31.961
FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE FORMS

02:49:32.028 --> 02:49:34.797
BUT FOR US. TO GO TO AND TO SAY

02:49:34.864 --> 02:49:36.699
THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY A SOCIAL

02:49:36.766 --> 02:49:38.468
MEDIA PLATFORM IS NOW BY

02:49:38.535 --> 02:49:40.770
DEFINITION. BY THE BY THE

02:49:40.837 --> 02:49:41.771
LEGISLATURE GOING FORWARD

02:49:41.838 --> 02:49:43.773
SAYING YOU ARE NOW YOU ARE A

02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:44.807
REPLACEMENT FOR THE PUBLIC

02:49:44.874 --> 02:49:49.012
FORUM. FOR THE PUBLIC SQUARE. I

02:49:49.078 --> 02:49:50.313
THINK THAT'S NOT TRUE I THINK

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:51.848
THAT'S IT OVERSIMPLIFICATION I

02:49:51.915 --> 02:49:53.683
THINK THERE ARE OTHER

02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:54.284
COMPLICATING FACTORS THAT ARE

02:49:54.350 --> 02:49:56.085
THERE. I DON'T DISAGREE THAT

02:49:56.152 --> 02:49:56.953
THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.821
DOING WHICH IS WHY YOU ASK ME

02:49:58.888 --> 02:50:00.423
WHAT WOULD I AGREE TO I WOULD

02:50:00.490 --> 02:50:01.591
AGREE TO ENSURING THAT THEY

02:50:01.658 --> 02:50:03.626
HAVE. POLICIES TRANSPARENT

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:05.328
POLICIES AND THAT THAT THE

02:50:05.395 --> 02:50:06.896
PUBLIC CAN SEE WHAT THEY ARE SO

02:50:06.963 --> 02:50:08.164
THAT THE PUBLIC WE AS THE

02:50:08.231 --> 02:50:09.899
PUBLIC CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:11.968
HOW WE'RE INTERACTING. I DON'T

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:14.237
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR. US

02:50:14.304 --> 02:50:15.471
IS THE LEGISLATURE TO BE

02:50:15.538 --> 02:50:18.374
DICTATING YOU ARE NOW. A PUBLIC

02:50:18.441 --> 02:50:21.744
FORUM YOU'RE NOT A PUBLIC FORUM.

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:22.879
THAT HAS TO BE AT THE END

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.714
INTERACTION BECAUSE THE POSTERS

02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:26.950
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE ARE AND

02:50:27.016 --> 02:50:28.351
THEIR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS ARE IN

02:50:28.418 --> 02:50:30.887
FACT. PROTECTED HOURS IN FACT

02:50:30.954 --> 02:50:34.023
WE AS AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS.

02:50:34.090 --> 02:50:36.059
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. WE CAN'T

02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:38.461
BLOCK. POSTERS WERE PEOPLE WE

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:40.029
CAN'T BLOCK. THINGS THAT WE

02:50:40.096 --> 02:50:41.698
FIND OFFENSIVE EVEN IF THEY ARE

02:50:41.764 --> 02:50:44.000
TRULY OFFENSIVE. BECAUSE IF WE

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:45.668
HAVE AN OFFICIAL SITE THAT

02:50:45.735 --> 02:50:47.904
CARRIES WITH IT THE EXPECTATION

02:50:47.971 --> 02:50:48.738
THAT WE ARE A GOVERNMENT

02:50:48.805 --> 02:50:50.073
OFFICIAL AND ARE LIMITED THAN

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:51.541
IN WHAT WE CAN DO. THAT'S

02:50:51.608 --> 02:50:53.576
DIFFERENT FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:50:53.643 --> 02:50:54.043
PLATFORM SO THE USERS

02:50:54.110 --> 02:50:56.379
INDIVIDUALLY. INCLUDING ALL OF

02:50:56.446 --> 02:50:58.448
US AS GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.

02:50:58.514 --> 02:51:01.217
HAVE PARTICULAR RIGHTS AND

02:51:01.284 --> 02:51:03.186
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT ARE

02:51:03.252 --> 02:51:03.786
ABSENT FROM THE WITH THAT ARE

02:51:03.853 --> 02:51:05.855
DIFFERENT. ACTUALLY FROM THE

02:51:05.922 --> 02:51:07.357
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM SOURCE TO

02:51:07.423 --> 02:51:08.658
IMPOSE UPON THE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:51:08.725 --> 02:51:10.793
PLATFORMS THAT YOU ARE NOW A

02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:12.729
FIRST AMENDMENT PUBLIC FORUM I

02:51:12.795 --> 02:51:17.634
pTHAT'S WHY I COULD BE THE

02:51:17.700 --> 02:51:19.569
RECOMMENDATION THAT I DID. ALL

02:51:19.636 --> 02:51:21.204
RIGHT MISS GALLAGHER YOU MAY

02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:23.406
CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER

02:51:23.473 --> 02:51:25.441
CHAIRMAN AND LOOK AT I THINK

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:27.543
THIS IS BEEN A GOOD DISCUSSION-

02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:29.212
I'LL I'LL JUST TAKE SOME PARTS

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:30.780
FROM THE ANALYSIS THAT I THINK

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:31.748
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

02:51:31.814 --> 02:51:33.916
THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW UNDER TWO

02:51:33.983 --> 02:51:34.984
THIRTY IN THE ANALYSIS POINTS

02:51:35.051 --> 02:51:37.186
THIS OUT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS

02:51:37.253 --> 02:51:39.322
ENJOY THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

02:51:39.389 --> 02:51:41.057
THURMOND FROM LIABILITY IF THEY

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:43.459
ALLOW AN OF OBJECTIONABLE AND

02:51:43.526 --> 02:51:46.195
HARMFUL POSTING. AND THEIR

02:51:46.262 --> 02:51:46.796
IMMUNE FROM LIABILITY IF THEY

02:51:46.863 --> 02:51:49.932
REMOVE IT. SO RIGHT UNDER TWO

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:51.901
THIRTY THERE'S REALLY YOU KNOW.

02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:53.803
WHAT I WANT TO DO AND I THINK

02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:54.570
WHAT MAYBE YOU HEAR A LOT OF

02:51:54.637 --> 02:51:56.806
CONSERVATIVES SAYING THAT HEY

02:51:56.873 --> 02:51:58.508
THERE SHOULD BE CENSORSHIP.

02:51:58.574 --> 02:52:00.510
THEY CAN'T DO RIGHT. AND THEN

02:52:00.576 --> 02:52:01.844
ON THE PROGRESSIVE LEFT FOR A

02:52:01.911 --> 02:52:02.912
LOT OF PEOPLE AND WE WANT YOU

02:52:02.979 --> 02:52:04.414
TO DO MORE TO REGULATE

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.516
DIFFERENT THINGS RIGHT. YOU CAN

02:52:06.582 --> 02:52:08.351
DO. THAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS

02:52:08.418 --> 02:52:10.119
OF THE LAW I THINK THAT'S

02:52:10.186 --> 02:52:11.254
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

02:52:11.320 --> 02:52:14.657
OKAY. AND ALSO AS A GERMAN IS

02:52:14.724 --> 02:52:17.026
POINTED OUT THIS IS I THINK A

02:52:17.093 --> 02:52:18.428
OF GROSS INCONSISTENCY THAT

02:52:18.494 --> 02:52:20.029
RIGHT NOW YOU WITH YOUR

02:52:20.096 --> 02:52:21.998
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT. IT WILL NOT

02:52:22.065 --> 02:52:23.866
IN YOUR GOVERNMENT OUT YOUR

02:52:23.933 --> 02:52:25.301
PERSONAL FACEBOOK THE YOU HAVE.

02:52:25.368 --> 02:52:26.703
YOU ARE LITERALLY NOT ALLOWED

02:52:26.769 --> 02:52:29.072
TO DELETE ANY COMMENTS. UNDER

02:52:29.138 --> 02:52:30.573
FIRST MET LAW BUT BUT THE

02:52:30.640 --> 02:52:31.808
SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY COULD SHUT

02:52:31.874 --> 02:52:33.676
DOWN YOUR ENTIRE ACCOUNT THEY

02:52:33.743 --> 02:52:34.744
COULD BUT THEY COULD SHUT DOWN

02:52:34.811 --> 02:52:36.546
THE ENTIRE PLATFORM AND THAT

02:52:36.612 --> 02:52:37.613
WOULD BE COMPLETELY

02:52:37.680 --> 02:52:39.916
PERMISSIBLE. YEAH I MEAN THAT

02:52:39.982 --> 02:52:41.217
KIND OF INCONSISTENCY DOESN'T

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:43.219
MAKE ANY KIND OF SENSE RIGHT WE

02:52:43.286 --> 02:52:44.921
EITHER ARE A PUBLIC FORM OR NOT

02:52:44.987 --> 02:52:46.923
AND I AND AS I'VE ARGUED I

02:52:46.989 --> 02:52:48.224
THINK WE VERY MUCH THESE

02:52:48.291 --> 02:52:49.826
PLATFORMS HAVE BECOME PUBLIC

02:52:49.892 --> 02:52:51.494
FORUMS AND SO I THINK WE NEED

02:52:51.561 --> 02:52:52.929
TO HAVE TO DO WE NEED TO DO TWO

02:52:52.995 --> 02:52:54.597
THINGS AND THAT'S- HENCE WHY

02:52:54.664 --> 02:52:57.200
THIS BILL HAS TWO PARTS. IS YOU

02:52:57.266 --> 02:52:58.401
NEED TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH. I

02:52:58.468 --> 02:52:59.736
WOULD THINK ABOUT THINK ABOUT

02:52:59.802 --> 02:53:00.403
IN THE SENSE OF THIS

02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:02.538
LEGISLATURE. IF SOMEONE WERE TO

THIS HOUSE AND I WAS JUST

03:05:11.767 --> 03:05:13.602

THAT YOU KNOW WE SHOULD CHANGE

03:05:14.970 --> 03:05:17.105

ABOUT THIS AND- BUT CERTAINLY

03:05:21.877 --> 03:05:23.745
THESE- COVENANTS WERE STRIKEN

03:05:23.812 --> 03:05:24.780
BY THE SUPREME COURT THEY'RE

03:05:24.847 --> 03:05:26.381
NOT LEGALLY BINDING THEY CAN'T

03:05:26.448 --> 03:05:28.250
BE ENFORCED. BUT THERE ARE A

03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:29.918
REMINDER A CRUEL REMINDER AND

03:05:29.985 --> 03:05:31.520
SOMETIMES BRINGS ABOUT TRAUMA

03:05:31.587 --> 03:05:33.589
INDIVIDUALS AND SOME WOULD SAY

03:05:33.655 --> 03:05:34.790
WOULD THEY SHOULD THEY SHOULD

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:35.958
REMAIN SO WE CAN LEARN ABOUT

03:05:36.024 --> 03:05:38.060
HISTORY WELL I WOULD SAY THAT

03:05:38.126 --> 03:05:39.294
YOU KNOW SHOULD WE GO TO THE

03:05:39.361 --> 03:05:40.696
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THE- WATER

03:05:40.762 --> 03:05:42.898
FOUND TO SAY WHITES ONLY- THE-

03:05:42.965 --> 03:05:44.399
MOVIE THEATERS NOW WE TOOK

03:05:44.466 --> 03:05:46.502
THOSE DOWN BECAUSE THERE WERE-

03:05:46.568 --> 03:05:47.836
NOT ONLY RACIST BUT THEY'RE

03:05:47.903 --> 03:05:49.037
INSENSITIVE AND THEY YOU KNOW

03:05:49.104 --> 03:05:52.774
THEY TRIGGERED. UNNECESSARY-

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:53.842
THOUGHT IT'S FAR AS HOW. IS

03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:56.144
USED TO TREAT- PEOPLE. AND SO

03:05:56.211 --> 03:05:57.846
YEAH THIS WE ARE CURRENTLY

03:05:57.913 --> 03:06:00.682
HAVING A- WRECKING ACROSS OUR

JUSTICE AND OUR POLICIES OF THE

03:06:05.020 --> 03:06:06.922
PAST AND- AND SOME WOULD SAY

03:06:06.989 --> 03:06:08.957
THAT THIS IS. TRULY SYMBOLIC

03:06:09.024 --> 03:06:09.858

NONETHELESS THIS IS AN

03:06:14.396 --> 03:06:15.430
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I THINK

03:06:15.497 --> 03:06:16.798
THAT. THAT WE SHOULD BE

03:06:16.865 --> 03:06:18.934

ONCE AND FOR ALL. IT WILL

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:30.012
SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR

STREAMLINED PROCESS. AND IT

03:06:40.689 --> 03:06:42.824
ALSO CREATES A- PROCESS WHEN A

TO UNSEAT SOMETHING OUTWARDLY

03:12:21.363 --> 03:12:23.331
PREJUDICE. THE COMPOSITION OF

THAT WE DO NOT GO BACK AND READ

03:18:00.902 --> 03:18:01.402
BECAUSE THEY'RE NO LONGER

03:18:01.469 --> 03:18:03.605
RELEVANT. IN SOME CASES YOU MAY

03:18:03.671 --> 03:18:05.039
FIND SOME OF THESE RACIAL

03:18:05.106 --> 03:18:07.141
COVENANTS WHICH ARE HIGHLY

03:18:07.208 --> 03:18:07.842

SO TO PUT IT INTO A INTO A-

03:18:17.118 --> 03:18:19.520
ESCROW PROCESS WITH WE THINK IT

03:18:19.587 --> 03:18:21.522
WILL TAKE WEEKS IF NOT LONGER

03:18:21.589 --> 03:18:22.857

THAT ARE THAT ARE COVERED IN

03:18:34.168 --> 03:18:35.670
THE BILL. THE WORLD FOCUSING

03:18:35.737 --> 03:18:40.608
MOSTLY ON. THE RACIAL COVENANTS

03:18:40.675 --> 03:18:41.242
BECAUSE THE MOST OFFENSIVE. BUT

03:18:41.309 --> 03:18:41.876
WE WOULD NEED TO A LEGAL. THE

03:18:41.943 --> 03:18:42.777
READ THROUGH ALL THOSE

03:18:42.844 --> 03:18:44.045
DOCUMENTS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY

03:18:44.112 --> 03:18:45.680
LITERALLY. CAN'T RECORD

03:18:45.747 --> 03:18:47.882
DOCUMENTS PAPER DOCUMENTS THAT

03:18:47.949 --> 03:18:50.051
ARE SCANNED INTO A DIG INTO A-

03:18:50.118 --> 03:18:51.619
COMPUTER IT IS NOT A DATABASE

03:18:51.686 --> 03:18:54.022
WE CANNOT DO- KEYWORD SEARCHES

03:18:54.088 --> 03:18:55.356
WE CANNOT LOOK. THROUGH

03:18:55.423 --> 03:18:56.958
DOCUMENTS LIKE THAT WE'D HAVE

03:18:57.025 --> 03:18:58.726
TO PULL THE BUCK ONE BY ONE.

03:18:58.793 --> 03:19:00.228
AND READ DOWN THROUGH THE MANY

03:19:00.295 --> 03:19:01.262
OF THEM HAND WRITTEN DOCUMENTS

03:19:01.329 --> 03:19:04.032
BACK TO THE EARLY. LATE

03:19:04.098 --> 03:19:04.932
EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS AND EARLY

03:19:04.999 --> 03:19:06.567
NINETEEN. SO IT'S NOT A PROCESS

03:19:06.634 --> 03:19:08.469
THAT'S EASY IT CAN BE VERY TIME

03:19:08.536 --> 03:19:10.938
CONSUMING AND COSTLY. AND SEAL

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:12.507
TA HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH

03:19:12.573 --> 03:19:13.641
THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE

WE'RE LOOKING AT A MORE GLOBAL

03:19:18.746 --> 03:19:20.415
APPROACH. THAT TAKES IT OUT OF

03:19:20.481 --> 03:19:22.450
ESCROW SO THE CONSUMERS DO NOT

03:19:22.517 --> 03:19:24.218
FACE THIS THESE COSTS AND DO

03:19:24.285 --> 03:19:26.054
NOT FACE THESE DELAYS. AND

03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:27.755

NEED TO GENERATE MONEY TO. TO

03:19:31.125 --> 03:19:32.427
LOOK FOR THESE THINGS IT'S

03:19:32.493 --> 03:19:34.128
GOING TO BE COSTLY TO DO IT.

03:19:34.195 --> 03:19:35.563

03:20:22.310 --> 03:20:23.611
REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS UNDER

03:20:23.678 --> 03:20:25.646
THIS NEW LAW. WOULD BE FACING

03:20:25.713 --> 03:20:27.915
HIGHER COSTS AND FEES. IN THEIR

03:20:27.982 --> 03:20:29.751
OWN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.

03:20:29.817 --> 03:20:31.319
WHEN WE RATHER TAKE IT OUTSIDE

03:20:31.386 --> 03:20:33.388
THE PROCESS. DO IT ALL ONCE AND

03:20:33.454 --> 03:20:35.089
THEN ANY CREATE A PROCESS WHERE

03:20:35.156 --> 03:20:35.857
THERE'S A MIRROR IMAGE

03:20:35.923 --> 03:20:37.925
DOCUMENT. WITH THESE THINGS ARE

03:20:37.992 --> 03:20:39.026
ACTUALLY STRUCK AND THEN THE

03:20:39.093 --> 03:20:40.828
CONSUMER NEVER RECEIVE THEM.

03:20:40.895 --> 03:20:42.230
BECAUSE THE FORWARD FACING

03:20:42.296 --> 03:20:43.197
DOCUMENT THAT'S PUT INTO THE

03:20:43.264 --> 03:20:45.032
PUBLIC RECORD. NO LONGER HAS

03:20:45.099 --> 03:20:46.934
THIS OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE WE LIKE

03:20:47.001 --> 03:20:48.669
TO WORK AS A PARTNER. WITH THE

03:20:48.736 --> 03:20:52.440
AUTHOR AND WITH OTHER GROUPS

03:20:52.507 --> 03:20:53.508
AND GOVERNMENTS YOU TO TRY TO.

03:20:53.574 --> 03:20:54.776
FORGET THESE THINGS ONCE AND

03:20:54.842 --> 03:20:56.411
FOR ALL- BUT WE THINK THROUGH

03:20:56.477 --> 03:20:57.612
THE ESCROW PROCESS WITH THE

03:20:57.678 --> 03:20:59.847
DELAYS AND INCREASED COSTS. IS

03:20:59.914 --> 03:21:01.983
THE WRONG WAY TO APPROACH THIS.

03:21:02.049 --> 03:21:06.454
THANK MAKE YOUR. MR CHAIRMAN

03:21:06.521 --> 03:21:08.055
MEMBERS- MIGHT BELOW TO

03:21:08.122 --> 03:21:09.123
SPEAKING FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:11.926
ESCROW ASSOCIATION- IT'S THE

03:21:11.993 --> 03:21:14.295
FIRST SECONDING- MR PAGE'S

03:21:14.362 --> 03:21:17.031
COMMENTS BUT- IN GENERAL MR

03:21:17.098 --> 03:21:18.866
MCCARTY HAS IDENTIFIED AND IS

03:21:18.933 --> 03:21:20.568
WORKING ON A COMPELLING ISSUE

03:21:20.635 --> 03:21:22.203
AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS DID A

03:21:22.270 --> 03:21:24.405
GREAT JOB OF ARTICULATING THE

03:21:24.472 --> 03:21:26.808
COMPLEXITY OF IT SOME PEOPLE

03:21:26.874 --> 03:21:28.576
RELATED PERSONAL ANECDOTES AND

03:21:28.643 --> 03:21:30.611
I HAVE ONE. OF THE FIRST HOUS

03:21:30.678 --> 03:21:32.180
I PURCHASED WAS IN THE LAND

03:21:32.246 --> 03:21:34.115
PARK PRETTY DESIRABLE AREA OF

03:21:34.182 --> 03:21:36.317
SACRAMENTO AND SPEND SOMEBODY

03:21:36.384 --> 03:21:37.785
GAVE ME AN AD WHEN THEY WERE

03:21:37.852 --> 03:21:41.556
SELLING LOTS AND LAND PARK IN

03:21:41.622 --> 03:21:42.056
NINETEEN FORTY THAT VERY

03:21:42.123 --> 03:21:44.258
PROMINENT ON THE AD WHERE THE

03:21:44.325 --> 03:21:46.394
WORDS HEAVILY RESTRICTED WHICH

03:21:46.461 --> 03:21:48.930
WAS OBVIOUSLY CODE FOR RACIAL

03:21:48.996 --> 03:21:51.999
COVENANTS. SO IN NINETEEN FORTY

03:21:52.066 --> 03:21:54.368
NOT ONLY WAS THIS NOT AN UGLY

03:21:54.435 --> 03:21:56.204
STAIN AS REFLECTED IN THE

03:21:56.270 --> 03:21:57.805
ANALYSIS IT WAS THE ACTUAL

03:21:57.872 --> 03:22:00.374
SALES FEATURE THAT'S HOW

03:22:00.441 --> 03:22:03.711
EMBEDDED RACISM HAS BEEN IN THE

03:22:03.778 --> 03:22:06.013
REAL PROPERTY SYSTEM SO THE

03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:08.149
ISSUE IS COMPELLING WHAT IT

03:22:08.216 --> 03:22:09.951
WHAT IS THE BEEN THE STRUGGLE

03:22:10.017 --> 03:22:11.519
FOR NOW FORTY YEARS I WAS FIRST

03:22:11.586 --> 03:22:13.221
INVOLVED IN A BILL IN THE MID

03:22:13.287 --> 03:22:14.055
NINETEEN EIGHTIES ON THIS

03:22:14.121 --> 03:22:17.525
SUBJECT IS HOW TO EFFICIENTLY-

03:22:17.592 --> 03:22:19.560
FIND THESE COVENANTS WHICH WERE

03:22:19.627 --> 03:22:22.263
PROBABLY. RECORDED SOMEWHERE

03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:24.065
BETWEEN THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTIES

03:22:24.131 --> 03:22:26.367
AND ABOUT NINETEEN FIFTY AND

03:22:26.434 --> 03:22:28.703
GET THEM REMOVED- I DON'T

03:22:28.769 --> 03:22:31.439
BELIEVE THAT- DELEGATING THIS

03:22:31.506 --> 03:22:33.741
TO TITLE INSURERS- WHO WOULD

03:22:33.808 --> 03:22:35.209
HAVE TO GO BACK AND GO THROUGH

03:22:35.276 --> 03:22:36.911
THE PROCESS THAT MR PAGE

03:22:36.978 --> 03:22:39.046
OUTLINE IS QUITE THE RIGHT

03:22:39.113 --> 03:22:41.716
ANSWER AND WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE

03:22:41.782 --> 03:22:42.750
BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR

03:22:42.817 --> 03:22:45.386
DECADES WERE WE'D LOVE TO SEE

03:22:45.453 --> 03:22:48.322
THIS RESOLVED IT IS AS MR CLARK

03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:50.858
NOTED AN UGLY STAIN. ON OUR

03:22:50.925 --> 03:22:54.228
SOCIETY AND- WE PLEDGE TO WORK

03:22:54.295 --> 03:22:56.097
WITH MR MCCARTY AND YOUR

03:22:56.163 --> 03:22:57.665
COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE

03:22:57.732 --> 03:22:59.634
IN RESOLVING IT BUT I DON'T

03:22:59.700 --> 03:23:01.269
THINK DELEGATING IT TO TITLE

03:23:01.335 --> 03:23:05.239
INSURERS. IS QUITE THE RIGHT

03:23:05.306 --> 03:23:06.474
ANSWER THANK YOU THANK YOU.

03:23:06.541 --> 03:23:07.108
OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN UP THE

03:23:07.174 --> 03:23:08.142
LINES ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD

03:23:08.209 --> 03:23:09.243
LIKE TO GIVE US THEIR NAME

03:23:09.310 --> 03:23:11.112
THEIR AFFILIATION. AND THAT

03:23:11.178 --> 03:23:16.517
THEY'RE OPPOSED TO AB. FOURTEEN

03:23:16.584 --> 03:23:17.985
SIXTY SIX. AND THIS IS IN

03:23:18.052 --> 03:23:20.254
OPPOSITION SIR ONCE AGAIN YES.

03:23:20.321 --> 03:23:21.722
OKAY THANK YOU AND IF YOU'RE

03:23:21.789 --> 03:23:23.057
SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS

03:23:23.124 --> 03:23:25.026
MEASURE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT

03:23:25.092 --> 03:23:32.667
THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE

03:23:32.733 --> 03:23:33.534
HAVE NO IN QUEUING UP AT THIS

03:23:33.601 --> 03:23:36.137
TIME. I THANK YOU I'M GOING TO

03:23:36.203 --> 03:23:38.673
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

03:23:38.739 --> 03:23:39.273
THIS MCCARTY WHEN I'VE TALKED

03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:41.475
ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT. AND I

03:23:41.542 --> 03:23:43.344
THINK THE FRUSTRATING THING IS

03:23:43.411 --> 03:23:44.378
MR BELOW ALLUDED TO THIS HAS

03:23:44.445 --> 03:23:46.414
BEEN. SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN

03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:47.882
TALKED ABOUT FOR OVER FORTY

03:23:47.949 --> 03:23:49.750
YEARS FORTY YEARS WE'VE KNOWN

03:23:49.817 --> 03:23:51.852
THIS PROBLEM AND THAT THE ISSUE

03:23:51.919 --> 03:23:53.721
ULTIMATELY IS WHATEVER GETS

03:23:53.788 --> 03:23:54.622
PROPOSED THERE SOMEBODY WHO

03:23:54.689 --> 03:23:57.458
SAYS- WE AGREED BUT NOT US NOT

03:23:57.525 --> 03:23:59.727
US NOT US NOT US. PERHAPS IT IS

03:23:59.794 --> 03:24:01.462
BETTER TO DO A GLOBAL CHANGE

03:24:01.529 --> 03:24:02.830
AND WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH IN

03:24:02.897 --> 03:24:04.098
THIS BILL AND WHAT I'M

03:24:04.165 --> 03:24:06.867
ECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON IS

03:24:06.934 --> 03:24:08.803
A MECHANISM TO HAVE IT HAPPEN

03:24:08.869 --> 03:24:10.104
IS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE

03:24:10.171 --> 03:24:11.606
ABLE TO FUNDS AND PERHAPS IN

03:24:11.672 --> 03:24:13.040
THE IN THE ANALYSIS RACES THIS

03:24:13.107 --> 03:24:14.709
ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME. THAT THE

03:24:14.775 --> 03:24:17.211
GOVERNMENT FIX THE PROBLEM THE

03:24:17.278 --> 03:24:19.580
GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY SOLVED OR

03:24:19.647 --> 03:24:21.616
CREATED OVER THE YEARS YEAH

03:24:21.682 --> 03:24:25.152
THAT'S THAT'S VERY TRUE. BUT

03:24:25.219 --> 03:24:25.620
WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE

03:24:25.686 --> 03:24:27.054
MECHANISM. AND I THINK THIS IS

03:24:27.121 --> 03:24:29.190
A BILL THAT PROPOSES A

03:24:29.256 --> 03:24:31.359
MECHANISM A VALID MECHANISM

03:24:31.425 --> 03:24:32.493
ANYTHING THAT GETS PROPOSED IS

03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:33.694
GOING TO HAVE SOME GROUP IN

03:24:33.761 --> 03:24:36.197
OPPOSITION. BUT THERE COMES A

03:24:36.263 --> 03:24:39.100
TIME WHEN WE JUST NEED TO PUT.

03:24:39.166 --> 03:24:41.402
SOMETHING ON THE TABLE THAT.

03:24:41.469 --> 03:24:44.071
THAT GETS THIS ACCOMPLISHED AND

03:24:44.138 --> 03:24:45.406
GETS IT ACCOMPLISHED IN AN

03:24:45.473 --> 03:24:47.408
EXPEDITIOUS MANNER. I THINK I

03:24:47.475 --> 03:24:48.943
WOULD RATHER SEE US INVEST IN

03:24:49.010 --> 03:24:50.745
JUST HAVE IT DONE GLOBALLY

03:24:50.811 --> 03:24:52.513
THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE

03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:53.648
AND THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET IT

03:24:53.714 --> 03:24:55.349
DONE. BUT AGAIN THAT BRINGS

03:24:55.416 --> 03:24:56.817
OPPOSITION AND WHETHER OR NOT

03:24:56.884 --> 03:24:58.019
WE'D BE ABLE TO FUND THAT IS A

03:24:58.085 --> 03:24:59.820
QUESTION. SO THIS BILL RIGHT

03:24:59.887 --> 03:25:01.489
NOW IS PROPOSING TRANSACTION BY

03:25:01.555 --> 03:25:03.491
TRANSACTION BASIS WHICH WILL

03:25:03.557 --> 03:25:05.326
PROLONG THE SOLUTION BUT AT

03:25:05.393 --> 03:25:08.262
LEAST IT IS. IF WE CAN PUT THIS

03:25:08.329 --> 03:25:08.996
IN PLACE SOMETHING THAT WILL

03:25:09.063 --> 03:25:11.732
GET. WILL WILL MOVE US TOWARDS

03:25:11.799 --> 03:25:14.168
ACCOMPLISHING A SOLUTION HERE

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:15.169
SO THAT'S WHY IT'S PROPOSED THE

03:25:15.236 --> 03:25:19.440
WAY IT IS. BUT FOR ME FRANKLY.

03:25:19.507 --> 03:25:20.041
I'M A BIT AGNOSTIC AS TO WHAT

03:25:20.107 --> 03:25:23.477
GETS. WHAT THE MECHANISM IS AS

03:25:23.544 --> 03:25:25.246
LONG AS IT GETS DONE AND WE CAN

03:25:25.312 --> 03:25:27.615
GET IT DONE AS QUICKLY AS WE

03:25:27.682 --> 03:25:30.051
CAN AND WE STOP THIS DECADES

03:25:30.117 --> 03:25:31.419
OF- WE WANT TO SOLVE THE

03:25:31.485 --> 03:25:32.586
PROBLEM BUT WE JUST CAN'T

03:25:32.653 --> 03:25:34.088
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT

03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:35.690
WAY WE CAN ALWAYS SAY THIS IS

03:25:35.756 --> 03:25:37.391
NOT THE RIGHT WAY AND THAT JUST

03:25:37.458 --> 03:25:39.560
MEANS IT WILL NEVER GET DONE.

03:25:39.627 --> 03:25:40.628
SO I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING

03:25:40.695 --> 03:25:42.396
THIS UP MISSED MCCARTY AND I AM

03:25:42.463 --> 03:25:43.431
VERY HOPEFUL THAT THIS

03:25:43.497 --> 03:25:44.432
COMMITTEE IS GOING TO MOVE THIS

03:25:44.498 --> 03:25:45.900
BILL FORWARD I KNOW YOU HAVE A

03:25:45.966 --> 03:25:46.634
LOT OF WORK TO DO WHEN YOU'RE

03:25:46.701 --> 03:25:48.569
COMMITTED THAT AND I APPRECIATE

03:25:48.636 --> 03:25:50.671
THAT THAT COMMITMENT THIS IS.

03:25:50.738 --> 03:25:54.041
THIS IS. AN EX. EXCELLENT

03:25:54.108 --> 03:25:56.210
BECAUSE- RIGHT OTHER MISTER

03:25:56.277 --> 03:26:00.848
GALLAGHER. YES- APPRECIATE THE

03:26:00.915 --> 03:26:02.883
AUTHOR AND CERTAINLY THESE

03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:05.286
RESTRICTIONS ARE REPREHENSIBLE-

03:26:05.352 --> 03:26:07.321
AND I THINK REPRESENT THE WORST

03:26:07.388 --> 03:26:13.394
OF OUR HISTORY- AND NO DOUBT

03:26:13.461 --> 03:26:16.664
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN.

03:26:16.731 --> 03:26:18.566
THE RELATIVE WEALTH AND

03:26:18.632 --> 03:26:21.102
HOMEOWNERSHIP OF AFRICAN

03:26:21.168 --> 03:26:25.773
AMERICANS. AND LATINOS- SO I

03:26:25.840 --> 03:26:27.475
TOTALLY SYMPATHIZE WITH WHAT

03:26:27.541 --> 03:26:31.946
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO HERE- TO

03:26:32.012 --> 03:26:35.182
THE POINT OF THE OPPOSITION. IS

03:26:35.249 --> 03:26:36.617
THERE A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS I

03:26:36.684 --> 03:26:37.618
MEAN IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE

03:26:37.685 --> 03:26:38.819
PROPOSING MAY BE OTHER WAYS

03:26:38.886 --> 03:26:40.554
THAT LIKE I KIND OF HEARD THAT

03:26:40.621 --> 03:26:45.192
THE MERE MERE IMAGE- RECORDINGS

03:26:45.259 --> 03:26:47.795
OR- OTHER WAYS OF DOING THIS IT.

03:26:47.862 --> 03:26:48.329
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE SAYING

03:26:48.395 --> 03:26:49.997
THERE'S THEY'RE OPEN TO FIGURE

03:26:50.064 --> 03:26:51.365
OUT HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE

03:26:51.432 --> 03:26:53.067
BUT MAYBE NOT MAKING IT PART OF

03:26:53.134 --> 03:26:57.271
THE ESCROW PROCESS- AND THIS

03:26:57.338 --> 03:26:57.872
WAY WHICH I THINK COULD END UP

03:26:57.938 --> 03:27:01.275
BEING. MORE EXPENSIVE AND DRAG

03:27:01.342 --> 03:27:03.210
OUT S. GROWS LONGER WHICH IS.

03:27:03.277 --> 03:27:06.680
WE NOT WE WANT TO DO- IN TERMS

03:27:06.747 --> 03:27:07.248
OF ENCOURAGING HOMEOWNERSHIP

03:27:07.314 --> 03:27:11.952
AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS BUT.

03:27:12.019 --> 03:27:13.521
I GET THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE

03:27:13.587 --> 03:27:14.855
THAT WE'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:16.190
ADDRESS I MEAN THE OTHER

03:27:16.257 --> 03:27:18.292
PROBLEM IS EVEN IF YOU DO A

03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:19.360
RECORDING IT DOESN'T REALLY

03:27:19.426 --> 03:27:21.228
NECESSARILY GET RID OF THAT

03:27:21.295 --> 03:27:22.496
RECORDING RIGHT IS JUST ANOTHER

03:27:22.563 --> 03:27:25.900
RECORDING THAT. KIND OF. ON

03:27:25.966 --> 03:27:27.067
PAPER EXTINGUISHES IT BUT IT'S

03:27:27.134 --> 03:27:28.702
STILL. BUT IT'S STILL A

03:27:28.769 --> 03:27:30.237
RECORDED DOCUMENT THAT'S ON

03:27:30.304 --> 03:27:33.974
TITLE RIGHT. SO MAYBE I MEAN I

03:27:34.041 --> 03:27:34.809
JUST MAYBE JUST FOR YOUR

OF ADDRESSING THIS ARE YOU OPEN

03:27:39.713 --> 03:27:41.182
TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS

03:27:41.248 --> 03:27:41.649
SAYING IN TERMS OF AN

03:27:41.715 --> 03:27:45.820
ALTERNATIVE- AND THEN EXPLAINED

03:27:45.886 --> 03:27:48.389
DOES I DON'T MY UNDERSTAND IS

03:27:48.455 --> 03:27:48.989
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET RID OF

03:27:49.056 --> 03:27:52.026
THE- OF THE OFFENSIVE CC IN

03:27:52.092 --> 03:27:53.060
OUR- LIKE BECAUSE THAT'S

03:27:53.127 --> 03:27:55.596
ALREADY RECORDED ON. TITLE LIKE

03:27:59.967 --> 03:28:01.702
ESSENTIALLY LIKE A MEN'S OR

QUESTIONS THERE- SO YEAH I

03:28:19.086 --> 03:28:21.222
THINK IT WOULD BE EASIEST IF WE

03:28:21.288 --> 03:28:23.257
JUST HAD A GLOBAL FAX BUT THE

03:28:23.324 --> 03:28:25.559
ESTIMATES ARE BETWEEN FIVE

03:28:25.626 --> 03:28:26.293
HUNDRED MILLION IN A BILLION

03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:27.895
DOLLARS AND WOULD YOU RATHER

03:28:27.962 --> 03:28:29.230
SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS TO

AMERICANS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR

03:28:34.235 --> 03:28:36.337
ACROSS CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT

03:28:36.403 --> 03:28:38.505
WE GOT TO DEBATE TO HAVE- THE

03:28:38.572 --> 03:28:40.641
OTHER THING IS BY DOING THIS

03:28:40.708 --> 03:28:42.109
THAT'S LIKE YEARS AGO WE WANTED

03:28:42.176 --> 03:28:43.277
TO CHANGE THE TOILETS FOR THE

03:28:43.344 --> 03:28:44.912
LOW FLUSH TOILETS NO IDEA WHAT

03:28:44.979 --> 03:28:47.014
TO DO I'M AT THE POINT OF SALE

03:28:47.081 --> 03:28:48.582
WELL WOULD TAKE THIRTY YEARS

03:28:48.649 --> 03:28:50.117
FOR EVERY PROPERTY TO FLIP OVER

03:28:50.184 --> 03:28:51.418
BEFORE YOU GOT TO EVERYBODY

03:28:51.485 --> 03:28:53.020
ITSELF. THIS DOESN'T GET TO

03:28:53.087 --> 03:28:54.455
EVERYBODY RIGHT AWAY POLICE IT

03:28:54.521 --> 03:28:55.956
STARTS ON A CONTINUAL BASIS

03:28:56.023 --> 03:28:56.957
LIKE WHEN I BOUGHT MY HOME

03:28:57.024 --> 03:28:59.059

COVENANTS MEANING AND HAVE THE

03:29:27.388 --> 03:29:28.355

DIFFERENT PROCESS SO WE WANT TO

03:30:40.327 --> 03:30:42.062
DO FOR THAT IS MAKE IT

03:30:42.129 --> 03:30:43.831
STREAMLINED SO ALL COUNTIES HAD

03:30:43.897 --> 03:30:46.166

CHARGED THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

03:30:53.607 --> 03:30:54.975

SO THAT'S A GIVEN BUT- THE

03:31:03.017 --> 03:31:04.351
OTHER PIECE IS WHAT ABOUT THE

03:31:04.418 --> 03:31:05.285
PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT

03:31:05.352 --> 03:31:08.722

CHANGE HANDS TO CHANGE. THAT

03:31:16.830 --> 03:31:18.832

WHEN WE TO READ A BILL THAT'S

03:31:24.805 --> 03:31:26.340
BEEN AMENDED. YOU STRIKE

03:31:26.407 --> 03:31:27.841
THROUGH THE OTHER LANGUAGE AND

03:31:27.908 --> 03:31:29.209
YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS TO REMOVE

03:31:29.276 --> 03:31:30.544

03:31:30.611 --> 03:31:32.212
PEOPLE TO. TO SEE IN THE FIRST

03:31:32.279 --> 03:31:34.214
PLACE. RIGHT BUT I THINK WHAT

03:31:34.281 --> 03:31:35.716
OPPOSITION IS SAYING IS THAN

03:31:35.783 --> 03:31:38.419

03:31:38.485 --> 03:31:40.120
NECESSARILY RIGHT THEY HAVE TO

03:31:40.187 --> 03:31:42.556
GO AND DO THE SEARCH TO. FIND

03:31:42.623 --> 03:31:43.590
IF THERE'S ANY OF THESE TYPES

03:31:43.657 --> 03:31:45.893
OF DOCUMENTS IN THERE. THAT'S

03:31:45.959 --> 03:31:46.527
GOING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

03:31:46.593 --> 03:31:50.664
TIME. AND COST OF THE ACTUAL

03:31:50.731 --> 03:31:53.400

YOUR BILL I THINK MAKES A WHOLE

03:31:58.839 --> 03:32:00.340
LOT OF SENSE LIKE GIVE MAKING

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.142

03:34:05.933 --> 03:34:07.734
MINUS THAT LANGUAGE SO WHEN

03:34:07.801 --> 03:34:09.836

03:34:09.903 --> 03:34:10.871

03:34:36.563 --> 03:34:38.599
INCREASES SUBSTANTIALLY THERE

03:34:38.665 --> 03:34:40.167
NEEDS TO BE MONEY PROVIDED TO

03:34:40.234 --> 03:34:41.935

HAVE BEEN RAISED. AND I WOULD

03:35:33.520 --> 03:35:33.954
ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN

03:35:34.021 --> 03:35:35.789
BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THERE ARE

03:35:35.856 --> 03:35:38.191
SOME MAYBE IMPLEMENTATION

03:35:38.258 --> 03:35:40.060
ELEMENTS OF THIS MOVE MIGHT

03:35:40.127 --> 03:35:40.961
HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SO

03:35:41.028 --> 03:35:42.696
THERE'S- THE OPPORTUNITY TO

ATTEMPTING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE

03:35:48.602 --> 03:35:51.638

OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO QUESTION

03:36:02.716 --> 03:36:04.318
THAT THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IS

03:36:04.384 --> 03:36:05.952

03:36:06.019 --> 03:36:08.855

OF GETTING ESCROW AND THEN IF

03:36:21.668 --> 03:36:23.603
THIS COST COULD ACTUALLY BE PUT

WE TRY THIS SOMEBODY'S OPPOSE.

03:38:00.233 --> 03:38:01.334
AND YES IT PROBABLY WOULD BE

03:38:01.401 --> 03:38:02.402
BETTER TO TRY TO DO THIS ON A

03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:04.438
GLOBAL BASIS IF WE CAN PULL

03:38:05.972 --> 03:38:07.808
WHY THIS WORKS IS ULTIMATELY

03:38:07.874 --> 03:38:09.709
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THROUGH

03:38:09.776 --> 03:38:10.644
THE ESCROW PROCESS BUT THAT

03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:11.912

03:38:11.978 --> 03:38:13.814
BEFORE. SO THAT WOULDN'T DELAY

03:38:13.880 --> 03:38:15.382

NEEDS. TO BE TAKEN AND THAT CAN

03:38:29.596 --> 03:38:30.096

03:55:57.543 --> 03:55:59.478
A COUPLE OF MONTHS. THIS TIME

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:01.714
THERE BECAME A LIVING

03:56:01.780 --> 03:56:04.750

TELLING HIM TO PRESS THE CALL

03:56:21.066 --> 03:56:24.203
LIFE WHEN HE WAS DONE. HE TOLD

03:56:24.270 --> 03:56:27.039

HIS BOTTOM. THIS LASTED FOR

03:56:32.678 --> 03:56:35.681
THREE MONTHS I FELT HELPLESS

03:56:35.748 --> 03:56:37.950
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MY

03:56:38.017 --> 03:56:40.486
FATHER MUST HAVE FELT. WE WANT

03:56:40.553 --> 03:56:42.688

03:57:01.674 --> 03:57:05.077
WAS SURPRISED AND SADDENED TO

03:57:05.144 --> 03:57:07.379
LEARN THAT LAST YEAR THE

03:57:07.446 --> 03:57:09.582
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WIPED

03:57:09.648 --> 03:57:12.017

04:10:30.181 --> 04:10:32.117
VIOLATION MOSTLY A CURRENT I

04:10:32.183 --> 04:10:33.418
NEVER ANSWERED THERE'S NO

04:10:33.485 --> 04:10:35.954
LAWSUIT FILED- AND YOU KNOW

04:10:36.020 --> 04:10:37.789
WORRIES PREVENTABLE TO A LOT OF

04:10:37.856 --> 04:10:39.557
RESIDENTS BUT FOR THOSE WHO DO

04:10:39.624 --> 04:10:41.459
HAVE THE RESOURCES TO GET

04:10:41.526 --> 04:10:42.761
ATTACHMENT TURNING CAN BE BE

04:10:42.827 --> 04:10:44.763
REALLY LIKE STATE IN TERMS OF

RESIDENT AND THE RESIDENTS AND

04:10:47.399 --> 04:10:48.366
THE ENTIRE STUDY THAT THAT

04:10:48.433 --> 04:10:49.934
RESIDENTS REPRESENTATION AND

04:10:50.001 --> 04:10:51.803
THE STOPPING OF THOSE

04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:54.472
VIOLATIONS REPRESENT- YEAH JUST

04:10:54.539 --> 04:10:55.507
SPEAKING TO THE HUMBLE COUNTY

04:10:55.573 --> 04:10:57.208
CASE THAT CASE ENDED UP

04:10:57.275 --> 04:10:58.410
SETTLING FOR FIFTY TWO MILLION

04:10:58.476 --> 04:11:00.078
DOLLARS BUT THAT CASE WAS

04:11:00.145 --> 04:11:02.914
ABOUT. WAS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

04:11:02.981 --> 04:11:03.915
RESIDENTS IN TWENTY TWO NURSING

04:11:03.982 --> 04:11:06.317
HOMES THAT SUFFERED FROM ONE

04:11:06.384 --> 04:11:08.453
POINT TWO MILLION DAYS OF THE

04:11:08.520 --> 04:11:10.221
FACILITY BEING UNDERSTAFFED

04:11:10.288 --> 04:11:11.523
THAT'S ONE POINT TWO MILLION A

04:11:11.589 --> 04:11:13.425
CURRENTLY PER RESIDENT OF THE

04:11:13.491 --> 04:11:14.526
FACILITY BEING CHRONICALLY

04:11:14.592 --> 04:11:16.461
UNDERSTAFFED IN THE REASON WHY

04:11:16.528 --> 04:11:17.028
IT WAS UNDERSTAFFED WAS TO

04:11:17.095 --> 04:11:20.098
INCREASE PROFIT SO EVEN IN THIS

04:11:20.165 --> 04:11:21.833
ONE OUT LIAR CASE IN THAT TRUST

04:11:21.900 --> 04:11:23.468
ME THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT OUT

04:11:23.535 --> 04:11:25.003
WHERE CAN I TOOK PROBABLY TWO

04:11:25.069 --> 04:11:27.105
DOZEN. FOURTEEN THIRTY CHANGES

04:11:27.172 --> 04:11:33.011
IN OUR AVERAGE CAN SETTLEMENT.

04:11:33.077 --> 04:11:33.511
WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE

04:11:33.578 --> 04:11:34.112
THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IN THAT

04:11:34.179 --> 04:11:36.080
ONE OUT LOWER CASE- IT WAS A

04:11:36.147 --> 04:11:36.948
SIGNAL. CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

04:11:37.015 --> 04:11:39.851
AND- LOTS AND LOTS OF FARM

04:11:39.918 --> 04:11:41.386
SUFFERED BY RESIDENTS DUE TO

04:11:41.453 --> 04:11:42.654
CHRONIC UNDERSTAFFING IN THE

04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.389
NAME OF A CUTTING COST SAVINGS

04:11:44.456 --> 04:11:50.428
AND MULTIPLYING PROFITS. THANK

04:11:50.495 --> 04:11:56.234
THE QUESTIONS. BERMAN THIS TOO

04:11:56.301 --> 04:11:57.602
MISTER CHAIRMAN- I AN

04:11:57.669 --> 04:11:59.571
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH BOTH

04:11:59.637 --> 04:12:02.373
SIDES ON THIS ISSUE AND- AND-

04:12:02.440 --> 04:12:04.542
IT JUST TOOK A COUPLE OF QUICK

04:12:04.609 --> 04:12:06.578
THOUGHTS FIRST- HAVING READ THE

04:12:06.644 --> 04:12:07.145
TWENTY TWENTY SUPREME COURT

04:12:07.212 --> 04:12:09.514
CASE I THINK IT REALLY POINTS

04:12:09.581 --> 04:12:11.616
AT THE PORTS OF OUR WORK HERE-

04:12:11.683 --> 04:12:13.418
BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT CASE

04:12:13.485 --> 04:12:16.287
TURNED ON- AN AMBIGUITY IN THE

04:12:16.354 --> 04:12:18.923
LAW THAT THE COURT DECIDED ON

04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.991
ONE WAY BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE

04:12:20.058 --> 04:12:21.659
WERE DISSENTING OPINIONS AND I

04:12:21.726 --> 04:12:23.127
THINK IF THERE ARE ONE OR TWO

04:12:23.194 --> 04:12:25.296
WORDS INSERTED INTO THAT- WE

04:12:25.363 --> 04:12:26.564
WOULDN'T BE HERE SAID SO THAT

04:12:26.631 --> 04:12:28.433
WAS INTERESTING TO ME- BUT THE

04:12:28.500 --> 04:12:30.335
OTHER THING- REMARK IS. HAVING

04:12:30.401 --> 04:12:31.402
MET WITH BOTH SIDES I DO

04:12:31.469 --> 04:12:32.604
UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE OTHER

04:12:32.670 --> 04:12:36.674
WAYS AND HOW WE RESOLVE THIS-

04:12:36.741 --> 04:12:37.909
THAT WOULD. ESTABLISH THE

04:12:37.976 --> 04:12:39.210
PROPER DISINCENTIVES FOR THE

04:12:39.277 --> 04:12:40.311
BEHAVIOR WE DO NOT WANT TO

04:12:40.378 --> 04:12:41.913
HAPPEN. THAT BEING SAID WE

04:12:41.980 --> 04:12:42.881
DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PROPOSALS

04:12:42.947 --> 04:12:44.082
INFRONT OF US WE HAVE A

04:12:44.148 --> 04:12:45.884
PROPOSAL. TO CHANGE THE STATUS

04:12:45.950 --> 04:12:47.719
QUO AND I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW

04:12:47.785 --> 04:12:48.987
I DON'T I THINK IT'S

04:12:49.053 --> 04:12:50.655
CHALLENGING FOR US. TO SAY THAT

04:12:50.722 --> 04:12:53.191
THERE SHOULD ONLY BE. FIVE

04:12:53.258 --> 04:12:54.659
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACTION SO

04:12:54.726 --> 04:12:56.227

CONVERSATIONS- TO SEE IF THERE.

04:13:02.734 --> 04:13:03.234
ARE BETTER WAYS TO STRUCTURE

04:13:03.301 --> 04:13:06.571
THIS- BUT BUT I THINK FOR NOW-

04:13:06.638 --> 04:13:07.839

04:13:07.906 --> 04:13:08.973
MOVE THIS FORWARD WE CERTAINLY
