WE GOT MILITARY FOLKS HERE SO WE GOT TO BE ON TIME RIGHT. FOR IT FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOURS I GUESS FORTINO SIX NOW BUT WE WANT TO OBVIOUSLY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND WELCOME THE VERY FIRST HEARING OF THIS SESSION OF THE ARE SELECT. SELECT COMMITTEE ON DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE AND OBVIOUSLY WELL WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SO PLEASED TO BE HAVING THIS HEARING TOGETHER WITH OUR FRIENDS FROM THAT BUSINESS PROFESSIONS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WHO OF COURSE OVERSEE THE DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT ISSUES RELATING TO LICENSURE. I HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR PROFESSIONS I REALLY DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S ENGAGING IN THIS DYNAMIC TOP BY TOPIC I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT CAREER PORTABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS AND MILITARY SPOUSES HAS AS BECOME A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S BEEN ONE THAT'S BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT FOR A LONG TIME. COUNTY STATE GOVERNMENT'S WEST JUST ACTUALLY HAD A WHOLE SESSION ON THIS AT THEIR ANNUAL CONFERENCE IN MONTANA MY WIFE IS ACTUALLY READING BECOMING RIGHT NOW THOUGH MICHELLE OBAMA BOOKING APPARENTLY IS A WHOLE SECTION THERE ABOUT HOW SHE WANTED TO TAKE ON HI THIS ISSUE AND OBVIOUSLY WAS ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS BUT. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE ALL STILL. I STRUGGLING HERE BECAUSE OF THIS. FASCINATING DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE STATE'S RIGHTS TO. MANAGE ITS OWN LICENSOR ROLES BUT ALSO OUR NATIONAL NEED. TOWARD A HAVING A MILITARY THAT REALLY WORKS FOR FAMILIES. SO THIS IS THIS IS CERTAINLY A PART OF THE CHALLENGE I DO WANT TO. SPEND A MOMENT ALSO TO THINK I WAS HERE MASON FROM BEING P. AND- AND OUR OUR FANTASTIC STAFFER WITH WITH WITH THE DEFENSE AND AEROSPACE LENA. WHOSE I THINK TO THEM OF JUST PULL TOGETHER REALLY FANTASTIC HEARING I'M AND I'M I REALLY YOU KNOW. THERE'S A LOT OF STAFF WORK THAT GOES. INTO MAKING THESE HEARINGS WORKING PLAN TOGETHER THESE REALLY GUY INFORMATIVE PACKETS AND- WHICH HAVE SO MUCH GOOD INFORMATION AND THEN I JUST WANT TO. TAKE. A MOMENT TO THANK. THE TWO OF YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS. SO LET'S JUST CHAT CHAT REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT ABOUT WHY WE'RE HERE. YOU KNOW COMPARED TO THE- CIVILIAN POPULATION. U. S. MILITARY SPOUSES AND VETERANS FACE. SPECIAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH. THEIR EMPLOYMENT MILITARY SPOUSES MOVE ACROSS STATE LINES. SEVEN TO TEN TIMES MORE OFTEN. THAN THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. SURPRISE THERE. THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR MILITARY WORKS IN THE BECAUSE THE WAY THAT WE- WE DO STAFFING THERE AND I THINK AS A RESULT IT'S IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA'S REGULATIONS. REFLECTS A NEED FOR SPOUSAL CAREER PORTABILITY TO EASE. NEW RESIDENT. TRANSITIONS AT THE TIME IT TAKES TO ACQUIRE LICENSE. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LICENSES PORTABILITY. IN A LACK OF TEMPORARY OR PROVISIONAL LICENSURE OPPORTUNITIES ALL CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT EMPLOYMENT OPTIONS AND REALLY. IMPACT. FAMILIES PORTABILITY AND WELFARE. AND HERE'S INTERESTING THING THAT THE WE KNOW FOR THAT FIND THEMSELVES TRANSITIONING% INTO CIVILIAN LIFE. TELL US THE DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A JOB WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY LICENSING REGULATIONS IS A TOP CHALLENGE. SO CALIFORNIA HAS COMMITTED IT'S HAS DEMONSTRATES COMMITMENT TO USING MANY OF THE BEARS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES AND VETERANS WE HAVE PASSED A COUPLE BILLS IN THE PAST THAT. THAT ARE IN THIS ARE IN THIS AREA YOU KNOW SILLY BILL NINETEEN OH FOUR AND A. B. ONE EIGHTY SIX. THEY WERE PASSED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RESPECT WITH THIS. I HAVE. IMPORTANT I CAN GROUNDWORK IN THIS AREA BUT WE STILL AYE AYES WILL LEARN TODAY WE HAVE A LITTLE WAYS TO GO ON IMPROVING AND BUILDING UPON THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION. HI YOU KNOW. SO LET'S HEAR DURING TALK ABOUT POLICIES CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA THAT REALLY TO VARIOUS LICENSING BOARDS. WE'RE GONNA TALK BUT AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT FOR CURRENT LICENSING REGULATIONS WERE TALK ABOUT PORTABILITY MODELS FROM OTHER STATES WE'RE GONNA HEAR ACCOUNTS FROM OUR MILITARY REGARDING CHALLENGES THEY FACE REGARDING. CAREER PORTABILITY I LEARN ABOUT CAL THAT'S PROGRAMMING FOR VETERAN TRANSITION ASSISTANCE TAKE TESTIMONY FOR MILITARY SPOUSE. CAREER PORTABILITY SPECIALIST AND MILITARY SPOUSES THEMSELVES. ARE SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT HERE I'M REALLY HOPING THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS. SOME OF THESE ISSUES THROUGH LEGISLATION REGULATION THAT COULD GET HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE RAISING TODAY. AT THE HEARING SO WITHOUT ALL OF TO OPEN. THE FLOOR TO REMARKS FROM OUR OUR CHAIR OF BEING P. AND THEN ALSO. OTHER MEMBERS BEFORE WE GET STARTED. WITH THAT AS THE HEARING. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALLEN I THINK IS THE STATE IN A. ARE VERY ARTICULATE WAY WE DO KNOW THAT LICENSING REQUIREMENTS CAN CREATES A BURDENS ON FAMILIES I IN THE MILITARY AND WE KNOW THAT. THAT THE MILITARY LIFE IS ONE THAT DOES REQUIRE RELOCATION. THE CENTRAL QUESTION THAT I THINK WE ALL WANNA WE HOPE THIS HEARING WILL REALLY ILLUMINATE. IS WHAT STEPS CAN WE TAKE TO EASE THE POTENTIAL BURDEN FOR LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHEN THAT'S THE CENTRAL QUESTION WHICH I HOPE WILL GET OUT OF THAT WONDERFUL TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE GONNA HEAR TODAY. UP WHILE OUR DISCUSSIONS NARROWLY FOCUSED ON THAT THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE I HOPE IN THE COMING YEAR AND IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS IT. WILL LOOK AT THE BROADER ISSUE OF LICENSURE. LICENSING REQUIREMENTS IN A WHOLE RANGE OF OTHER AREAS I KNOW WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT. OVER THE SUMMER AT SHARE ALLEN ABOUT THAT. AND SO FOR ME IT'S THE JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS TYPE OF IMPORTANT EXAMINATION THAT WILL START TODAY. THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT CAN MEET IN THIS HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THAT I ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF OKAY LET'S GO LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED AND MOM HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE A GOOD. DISCUSSION WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE HEAT WITH THE PANEL ON MILITARY SPOUSE VETERAN LICENSE OR STATUS AND NEEDS. WE'VE GOT A KELLY MAY DOUGLAS IS HERE FROM DEPARTMENT DEFENSE. SHE ACTS AS ONE OF SEVERAL. DEFENSE STATE LIAISONS THAT THAT COVER DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OF THE COUNTRY I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE SOUTHWEST. AS PART OF YOUR- YOUR YOUR YOUR AREA WITH ANY PRO OAKLEY USE MANAGER OF THE OFFICE OF STUDENTS IS IT'S A REALLY FOR DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. I APRIL OAKLEY. OUR GUIDE AARON SCREWBALL WHOSE INTERIM DIRECTOR OF CERTIFICATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING WHICH OF COURSE IS. ONE AREA OF REAL NEED IN THIS AREA AND FINALLY AB UNIONS WHO'S THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE BARS OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS OPEN TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH LAWYERS AND LICENSOR THERE SO WHAT WE GET START WITH YOU. I MISSED A LISTEN REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU BEING HERE. THANK YOU CHAIR ALLEN CHERRY GLAZER. AND IS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. MY NAME IS KELLY MAY DOUGLAS'S CENTER ALLEN MENTIONED ON BEHALF OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND MILITARY FAMILIES. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR OPENING UP THIS VENUE FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M- IN IN HELPING US TO ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL AN OUTCOME. ORIENTED CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE OF LICENSURE AND THE LARGER ISSUE OF CAREER PORTABILITY. FOR THE MILITARY COMMUNITY AND I'M PARTICULARLY FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. WITH THAT SAID I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED AND WE HAVE A- TAPE. SCHEDULE HERE SO MY OFFICE IS THAT THE DEFENSE STATE LIAISON OFFICE I IT WE WORK UNDER THE MILITARY COMMUNITY AND FAMILY POLICY DEPARTMENT UNDER. THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY A DETECTIVE MEDIA ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR. FOR PERSONAL READINESS. SO OUR OFFICE WORKS ON SPECIFICALLY ON AND STATE POLICY BASICALLY WELL WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO HARMONIZE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE POLICY. ON BEHALF OF SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND WE DEAL MOSTLY WITH QUALITY OF LIFE TYPE TYPE ISSUES. IN THE PAST WE WORKED ON FAMILY LAW EDUCATION OCCUPATIONAL LICENSURE EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT CONSUMER VOTING I PROTECTION VOTING PROTECTIONS FOR NATIONAL GUARD AND THE STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WE'VE ALSO WORKED AND IN PARTICULAR OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ON AND STUFF LIKE CENTER IN ON K. TWELVE EDUCATION I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND LITTLE BIT. UNDERWEAR ISSUES COME UP AND YOU BECOME UP AT THEIR BROUGHT TO US ANNUALLY SUBMITTED BY THE SERVICE BRANCHES AND OTHERS KEY STAKEHOLDERS WE REVIEW THEM RESEARCH THEM. ASCERTAIN THE APPLICABILITY ACROSS THE STATE IT'S FOR THESE POLICY ISSUES AND WE HIGHLIGHT AND FOCUS ON THOSE THAT ARE MOST HABITABLE ACROSS ALL. ALL OF THE STATE. TWO I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS TERM IN THE MILITARY BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT SO NOW YOU KNOW WHEN EXTRA MILITARY TERM BLUFF SO. THE MILITARY SPOUSE TODAY IS OUR FOCUS IS MY FOCUS AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. CONDITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS AS WELL AS VETERANS AS WELL AND ANY TO ANY POLICY THAT BENEFITS MILITARY SPOUSES IS GOING TO BENEFIT THOSE THOSE POPULATIONS AS WELL. MY PARTICULAR FOCUS ON MILITARY SPOUSES IS JUST ACKNOWLEDGING THE- FREQUENT TRANSITION THAT THEY AN INDOOR AND THAT IT IS THIS REPETITIVE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR CAREER THAT HAS THE IMPACT ON. THEIR CAR CAREER SISTINE ABILITY ATTAINMENT AND ALSO THEIR FAMILY'S FINANCIAL STABILITY SO IT BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS THAT'S JUST OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW BUT AGAIN ANYTHING WE DO CAN BE APPLIED ACROSS THE BOARD. AND WE DEFINITELY THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF VETERANS AND TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS AS WELL. SO MILITARY SPELLS MOBILITY IS NOT A CHOICE HAVING PUTTING THAT UP FRONT IT YOU SOME MIGHT THINK THAT IT'S A CHOICE BUT IT'S NOT A VIABLE CHOICE FOR FAMILIES SO WE KNOW THAT WHEN I'M- CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS IN SIMILAR SITUATION AS MILITARY SPOUSES. REALIZE THE DIFFICULTY THAT MIGHT INCUR FROM THE MOVE THEY MIGHT HAVE THE OPTION TO CHOOSE NOT TO MOVE WHERE MILITARY SPOUSE THERE'S TWO OPTIONS THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO MOVE AND DISRUPT THEIR ENTIRE FAMILY OR THEY CAN NOT THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE THEIR LICENSE IN THAT STATE. IS OBVIOUSLY STILL CREATING A DISTRACTION FOR THE FAMILY AS FAR AS ECONOMICS. SO IT'S NOT A CHOICE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A LOSING PROPOSITION FOR MILITARY SPOUSES IN TERMS OF MOBILITY AND MOBILITY IS GOT IS DIRECTED BY THEIR SPOUSE THEIR ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBER OR RESERVE AND THEY'RE ACTING THERE'D SERVICE MEMBERS COMMAND AND MISSION REQUIREMENTS. MILITARY SPOUSES ARE HIGHLY SKILLED AND HIGHLY EDUCATED I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT. BUT SEE. 32% AND THEY'RE ALL OF THE NUMBERS ACROSS THE BORDER HIGHER THAN THEIR AVERAGE BUT GRADUATE OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREE VERSES 12% FOR THE CAT COUNTERPARTS IN CALIFORNIA SO WITH THESE THESE ARE HIGH I REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW AND YOU THERE ACROSS THE BOARD YOU HAVE YOUR SPOUSE'S IN EVERY INDUSTRY BUT BUT AS FAR AS I'M KIND OF BREAKING SOME STEREO TYPES ABOUT MILITARY SPOUSES BEING YOUNG AROUND EDUCATED THEY'RE- THEY'RE HIGHLY EDUCATED. AND THERE IS A HUGE ASSET TO THE STATE. I THEY'RE ALSO SO SPELL SO CAREER SATISFACTION AND FAMILY ECONOMIC SECURITY AFFECTS MILITARY RETENTION THAT SAID IT'S A KEY THEME THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT AND YOU'LL HEAR IT FROM OTHERS BUT HAVE REPORTED THAT THEIR SPOUSES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CAREER IMPACTS THEIR DOES DECISION TO STAY IN THE MILITARY BY A LARGE OR MODERATE EXTENT IN ADDITION 77% OF MILITARY SPOUSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE ON IN A SURVEY THAT THEY EITHER WANTED OR NEEDED TO WORKS OF SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND WHEN WE GO INTO THE DEMOGRAPHICS YOU'LL SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT THAT THAT THAT WANTING OR NEEDING TO WORK IN IN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF THOSE WORKING AND WE THINK THAT LICENSURE BARRIERS ARE PART OF THAT PART OF THAT KIND OF EQUATION. FINALLY MILITARY SPOUSE LICENSING IN EMPLOYMENT IS OF ECONOMICS ITS IMPORTANCE TO STATES PRIMARILY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF SUSTAINING MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND THE THREE SERVICE SECRETARIAT. RECENTLY LAST YEAR PUT OUT A LETTER SENT A LETTER TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION IS STATING THAT K. TWELVE EDUCATION AND MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT. AND LICENSURE WOULD BE ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS WHEN LOOKING AT BASING DECISIONS THAT LETTER IT SHOULD BE AND YOUR PACKETS AND IT'S IN THE IT'S ALSO AND CONTAINED IN THE- SENATE ARMS SERVICES COMMITTEE REPORT FROM MARCH OF THIS YEAR. ALRIGHT SO IS FAR AS DEMOGRAPHICS I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF KEY POINTS THE NUMBER ONE KEY POINT IS THAT. MILITARY SPOUSES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY LICENSE LICENSING BARRIERS. SO YOU CAN SEE I DON'T BECAUSE HAS A POINT OR DOES IT. OKAY I'M I'M I'M NOT GONNA CHECK. OKAY SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN BUT SEE THE PART I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WAS SO CALIFORNIA ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SPOUSES SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THAT NUMBER IS IMPORTANT IT'S TWENTY IT'S 12% OF THE TOTAL US MILITARY SPOUSE POPULATION IS JUST JUST IN CALIFORNIA OF THAT NUMBER FORTY SIX OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND OR IN THE WORK FORCE. SO IT'S 61% OF THE MILITARY SPOUSES IN CALIFORNIA ARE IN THE WORK FORCE. AND THEN THE POINT I REALLY WANTED TO DRIVE DOWN WAS THE NEXT ONE SO THOSE MILITARY SPOUSES THAT ARE IN THE WORK FORCE THAT REQUIRE LICENSURE OR CERTIFICATION IS FIFTH AVE ALMOST SIXTEEN THOUSAND WHICH IS 34% OF THE WORKING FORCE. OF CALIFORNIA MILITARY SPOUSES. SO CALIFORNIA AND ALSO THAT NUMBER IS THE SAME NATIONWIDE REQUIRE A LICENSED PROFESSION. COMPARED POPULATION SO 21% OF CALIFORNIA. WORKING POPULATION REQUIRES A LICENSE 34% COMPARED 234% A MILITARY SPOUSE COMMUNITY. 22% NATIONWIDE SO IT'S SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA SO NATION WIDE TWENTY TWO CALIFORNIA TWENTY ONE MILITARY SPOUSE THIRTY FOUR. IN ADDITION THEIR MILITARY SPOUSES MOVE BETWEEN. ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR YEAR EVERY TWO IN FOUR YEARS THEY'RE MOVING A LOT SO ON TOP OF HAVING A HIGHER NUMBER OF THAT THE WORKING SPOUSES THAT NEED A LICENSE ON TOP OF THAT THEY'RE MOVING. AS CENTER ALLEN SAID SEVEN TO TEN TIMES MORE THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS. AND EACH SO FOR EACH MOVE 73% OF A MILITARY SPOUSE PROFESSIONALS ARE HAVING TO APPLY FOR REAL WE LICENSURE. BEFORE THEY CAN MARK SO IT'S A BIG IT'S A BIG DEAL IT REALLY DOES IT'S A DISPROPORTIONATE. IMPACT ON MILITARY SPOUSES VERSES THE GENERAL POPULATION OF THOSE WHO MIGHT BE MOVING AS WELL. SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO TOO MUCH DETAIL HERE I CAN SHARE INFORMATION OFFLINE LATER BUT WE DO GET ASKED A LOT YOU KNOW HOW IT HOW DOES DEPARTMENT DEFENSE CONTRIBUTE TO THIS EVER OF HELPING SPOUSES. WE HAVE SEVERAL PROGRAMS IN PLACE THE SPOUSE EDUCATION CAREER OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM MY CA AND AS C. P. AND THEN INSTALLATION EACH INSTALLATION HAS FAMILY MEMBER EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS. ON TOP OF THAT THOSE PROGRAMS SINCE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS. LAST YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NDA AUTHORIZED EACH OF THE SERVICE BRANCHES TO REIMBURSE SPOUSES FOR AT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LICENSURE RELATED FEES. OF A TOOK THE SERVICE BRANCHES AWHILE TO IMPLEMENT THAT BUT IT'S FINALLY AND IMPLEMENTATION. YES SIR FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO EACH MILITARY SPOUSE AS A REIMBURSEMENT. IN EACH BRAND YOU CAN GO ONLINE IT'S ONLINE AS FAR AS HOW THOSE PROGRAMS WORK AND THEN AND THEN FINALLY MY DEPARTMENT IS PART DEPARTMENT DEFENSE AND WE ARE I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STATE GOVERNMENTS IMPROVE LICENSURE PORTABILITY THROUGH POLICY CHANGE. A SO IS FAR AS THE KIND OF LOOKING AT THE LOOKING AT THE ISSUE AND LOOKING AT IT HISTORICALLY. ART MY OFFICE IS BEEN WORKING ON LICENSURE SERVICE MEMBER VETERAN AND SPOUSE LICENSURE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT SINCE THAT TIME WE IN A ACT WE HELPED ENACT SIXTY NINE BILLS IN FORTY SEVEN STATES MOST OF THEM FOCUS ON LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT. TEMPORARY LICENSURE AN EXPEDITED APPLICATION PROCESSING THEY MOSTLY COVERED HEALTHCARE AND COMMERCIAL OCCUPATIONS AND THEY DID NOT INCLUDE MODE BY AND LARGE DID NOT INCLUDE TEACHERS AND ATTORNEYS BECAUSE THERE. THEY WERE LICENSE THROUGH. OUTSIDE ENTITIES FROM THE MAIN KIND OF FOCUS THAT WE HAD WITH A CONSUMER AFFAIRS. SO. CALIFORNIA TIME AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA'S PLACE A NIGHT IN THAT TIME FRAME WE'VE THESE ARE I'M SPECIFIC TO ENACTED LEGISLATION ON A LICENSURE AND NOT JUST FOR SPOUSES BUT FOR MILITARY AND VETERANS. SO THERE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT DONE IN DOD WANTS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS WORKED HARD THESE LAST FEW YEARS OUR LAST DECADE I GUESS. YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE ENTRY INCREMENTAL CHANGE AND TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THE ONLY I'M KIND OF TAKE AWAY I HAVE IS KIND OF TWO POINTS ONE IS YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY ARE APPRECIATIVE OF CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS. TO IS IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS JUST AS IN THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHERE WE DID PASS ALL THOSE BILLS ACROSS THEY GET. OR CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE BILLS BEING PASSED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WE STILL HAVE. AN ISSUE SO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE WERE STILL HEARING. EVEN AFTER ALL THESE BILLS IN ALL THE STATES WE ARE STILL HEARING FEEDBACK FROM SPOUSES THAT THEY WERE STILL EXPERIENCING MAJOR CHALLENGES AND LICENSING AND SO WE WONDERED YOU KNOW WE DID ALL THIS WORK THE STATE'S DID ALL THIS WORK WHAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. AND SO WE DID IT WE CHARTERED AS A STUDY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA. IN ALL FIFTY STATES AND SIX WE SELECTED SIX AREAS AS A SNAPSHOT IN THOSE AREAS ARE COMMONLY THEY'RE NOT NOT ALL OF THEM ARE THE TOP OCCUPATIONS. BUT A LOT OF THESE OCCUPATIONS ARE COMMONLY. I GUESS IT YET UTILIZED BY MILITARY SPOUSES. SO I WE FOUND THAT FORTY TWO STATES WERE PROVIDING TEMPORARY LICENSING THIRTY NINE WERE MAKING ENDORSEMENT OF EXISTING LIGHT LE LICENSES AVAILABLE AND THIRTY ONE WERE X. EXPEDITING THE PROCESS AND I THAT'S A MISTAKE THERE'S ACTUALLY THEY WERE NOT EXPEDITING THE PROCESS OF GETTING A LICENSE EXPEDITING THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR A LICENSE IS WHAT THAT FOUND. AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THE NEWS THREE THOSE THREE APPROACHES ENDORSEMENT TEMPORARY AND AN EXPEDITED DID NOT RELIEVE THE UNDERLYING BURDEN OF LICENSING IT ONLY MADE THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FASTER AND WE ALSO FOUND THE BOARDS WERE NOT UNIFORMLY IMPLEMENTING STATE LAWS. I WERE CALIFORNIA STOOD WITH THAT WAS THAT CALIFORNIA HAD TEMPORARY LICENSING FOR NINE PROGRAMS AND- EXPEDITED LICENSING FOR MILITARY SPOUSES BUT DID NOT HAVE REAL A REAL AND STILL DOES NOT HAVE A REAL EASY ENDORSEMENT PROCESS. AND I JUST WANNA LEAVE THIS HERE I'M NOT GOING TO READ THIS BUT I. BECAUSE WE HAVE SPOUSES ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING THE SAME KIND OF TESTIMONY BUT THE FIRST EXAMPLE DOES SHOW THIS IS I'M A MILITARY SPOUSE TEACHER IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA I THINK AND THE TEACHER THAT CALIFORNIA AND- COMMISSION TEACHER A CUT A CREDENTIALING IS PROBABLY AN EXAMPLE OF A LIKE A MODEL EXAMPLE OF A OF A BOARD THAT. THAT YOU KNOW KIND OF HAD THE POLICIES ARE THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR TEACHERS IS PROBABLY MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER BOARDS. BUT IT WITH THAT THERE'S STILL A HUGE YOU KNOW KIND OF BURDEN FOR MILITARY SPOUSES IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS OF GETTING VALIDATING. THEIR PREVIOUS LICENSE AND THE EXPIRY AYE EMPLOYMENT HISTORY I HAVEN'T CONTACT OLD EMPLOYERS TO GET THEM TO CONTACT THE STATE TO GIVE THEIR EVALUATIONS AND SUCH SO. EVEN IN A GOOD CASE SCENARIO OUR SPOUSES ARE STILL EXPERIENCING ISSUES AND THEN THE SECOND ONE WAS REGARDING A SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGIST AND- I AND NOW I'M IN A PIGGY BACK ON. UP FROM THAT EXAMPLE IT AFTER AT THE END OF THIS SO I JUST. WANTED TO KIND OF POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW. THE STORY LINE IS THIS WE'VE DONE A LOT. AND WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS AND WE DEFINITELY APPLY CALIFORNIA FOR IT FOR WHAT IT'S DONE BY EVEN DESPITE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE WE'RE STILL EXPERIENCING ISSUES AND THAT. LEADS ME TO WHAT WHEN I CLOSE KIND OF SOME OF. OUR IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. THANK YOU. THE CARD RECEDED I WILL NEXT YEAR FROM APRIL OAKLEY FROM DCA. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS ALLEN GLAZER IN MEMBERS. OAKLEY MANAGER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE OF STUDENT ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF WITHIN THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND ITS LICENSURE BENEFITS AVAILABLE TO MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES I'M HERE TODAY SPEAKING AS THE CHAIR OF DC'S NEW MILITARY LICENSURE COMMITTEE. WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED TO A TO ENHANCE THE DEPARTMENT'S OVERALL ASSISTANCE TO MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I AM HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY ADDRESSING IMPORTANT TOPIC A MILITARY SPOUSE AND VETERAN CAREER PORTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I COME FROM A FAMILY WITH GENERATIONS OF MILITARY EXPERIENCE. MY FATHER SERVED TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE AIRFORCE WITH THE MAJORITY OF HIS CAREER SERVE THAT TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE NEARBY. AND MY BROTHERS CURRENTLY STATIONED AT CAMP PENDLETON IN SAN DIEGO. ASSISTING MILITARY FAMILIES IS A PASSION OF MINE. DC IS COMMITTED TO SERVING AND PROTECTING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IT IS COMPRISED OF THIRTY SEVEN DIFFERENT BOARDS BUREAUS A COMMISSION IN PROGRAM THAT IT MINISTER MORE THAN THREE MILLION LICENSES PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES ACROSS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PROFESSIONAL. IN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE TYPES. THESE PROFESSIONS VERY FROM DOCTORS TO DENNIS THE COURT REPORTERS TO SMOG CHECK TECHNICIANS NOT TO MENTION FOR PROFIT PRIVATE COLLEGES. THE PRIMARY MISSION OF DCA IN ITS BOARD IN GROWTH IS CONSUMER PROTECTION. PCA'S PROGRAMS HAVE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE PROCESSING OF LICENSURE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED FROM MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES SEEKING LICENSURE. BILLS MANDATED REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE POSTING DC'S MILITARY BENEFIT INFORMATION ON THEIR PROGRAMS WEBSITE. CAPTURING MILITARY SERVICE INFORMATION ON LICENSING APPLICATIONS. IN AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION PASSED OVER THE YEARS THAT APARTMENT PROBABLY OFFERS MILITARY EXCUSE ME PROBABLY OFFERS BENEFITS TO MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES INCLUDING EXPEDITED LICENSING EXPEDITED LICENSING APPLICATION PROCESSING FOR HONORABLY DISCHARGED MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES RENEWAL FEE WAIVERS FOR MILITARY MEMBERS CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY. AND TEMPORARY LICENSURE. WITH DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT SPREE SYSTEM TO DATE THE BOARD UTILIZING BREEZE ARE EXPEDITING MILITARY SPOUSE APPLICATIONS ON AVERAGE NINETEEN DAYS FASTER THAN OTHER APPLICATIONS AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE ALSO ISSUED APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED RENEWAL FEE WAIVERS TO ACTIVITIES SERVICE MEMBERS. TO ASSIST MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES SEEKING LICENSURE WITH THE CA THE DEPARTMENT HAS DEVELOPED I HAD HAS DESIGNED A MILITARY WEB PAGE ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE THAT WAS RECENTLY REVAMPS BASED ON FEEDBACK RECEIVED FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. I DESIGNATED MILITARY EMAIL ADDRESS MILITARY AT DC YOU DOT CA DOT GOV TO ASSIST MILITARY MEMBERS WITH QUESTIONS REGARDING LICENSURE AND OUR MILITARY BENEFITS. IN DESIGNATED STAFF AVAILABLE TO ASSIST MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES THROUGHOUT THE LICENSURE PROCESS SELECT BOARDS IN HEROES. THE DC IS OPEN TO ADDRESSING AREAS OF NEED WHERE I CAN PROVIDE VALUE TO MEMBERS OF THE MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE BUREAU OF SECURITY AND INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES WHICH LICENSES PRIVATE SECURITY GUARDS WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT THROUGH ITS WORK FROM WARRIORS PROGRAM WHICH HELPS LICENSE TRAIN. AN EMPLOYEE MILITARY MEMBERS IN A SINGLE DAY. HUNDREDS OF MILITARY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN HELP THROUGH THIS EFFORT OVER THE YEARS WITH INFANTRY BEING THE LARGEST MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTY THIS IS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL TO THESE MEN AND WOMEN. THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION HAS HAD A LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH CALVET IN REVIEWING AND APPROVING PROGRAMS OFFERED BY CALIFORNIA PRIVATE COLLEGES SEEKING TO ENROLL VETERANS. BBB EASE OFFICE OF CYNICISM VERY LEAVE WHICH OPENED ON JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PARTNERS WITH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES INCLUDING COMMENTS CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ALSO KNOWN AS CAL TOP. TO SEIZE CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS INCLUDING STUDENT VETERANS. AFFECTED BY THE CLOSURE OF A PRIVATE COLLEGE ALSO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND TO HELP STUDENTS MAKE INFORMED CHOICES WHEN SELECTING PRIVATE SELECTING A COLLEGE FEES ME. BUILDING ON THIS RELATIONSHIP THE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY PARTNERED WITH CALVET TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN THE SENATE BILL ELEVEN THIRTY SEVEN OFFERED BY SENATOR VIDAK: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WHICH PROVIDES THAT CALVET IN DCA CONSOLE WITH ONE ANOTHER TO INCREASE AWARENESS REGARDING THE PROFESSIONAL LICENSING BENEFITS. AVAILABLE TO VETERANS AND THEIR SPOUSES. PCA'S MILITARY BENEFIT INFORMATION IS NOW AVAILABLE I EXCUSE ME IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE STANDING PRESENTATION ACCOUNT TOP STOP PRESENT TO DO CHARGING SERVICE MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHILE WE ARE PROUD OF OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO ASSIST MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT. CURRENTLY NOT ALL THE C. PROGRAMS RECOGNIZE LICENSES FROM OTHER STATES AS A MEANS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BEGIN WORKING IN CALIFORNIA UPON ARRIVAL OFTEN REFERRED TO AS RECIPROCITY. THIS COULD BE DUE TO A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING THE FACT THAT MANY PROGRAMS HAVE CALIFORNIA'S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE MORE STRINGENT. THAN THOSE IN OTHER STATES. LICENSING RECIPROCITY MAY ALSO BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE GIVEN THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM'S WITHIN DCA AND THE LOCATIONS THAT THEY LET ME LICENSE. A PROGRAM SPECIFIC APPROACH TO MORTGAGE MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING LICENSE PORTABILITY. PRIVATE DEPARTMENT WIDE INITIATIVES ARE OFTEN NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES OR LICENSE TYPE ALLOWS FOR THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS ARE BARRIERS WE ENCOURAGE THE MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. TO CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT IDENTIFY POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND ARE AWARE THAT THAT LICENSE PORTABILITY IS ONE OF THEIR TOP INTERESTS WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE COLLABORATION WITH THEIR DEPARTMENT. OUR DEPARTMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW ASSISTING MILITARY MEMBERS AND THEIR SPOUSES WITH OBTAINING LICENSURE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT OKAY LET'S LET'S WAIT FOR FROM ONE TO PRESENT IT WILL HAVE A DISCUSSION WHEN X. YOU'RE FROM ERIN SCHOOL BALL FROM OUR CTC. THANK YOU I'M AND THANK YOU SO MUCH MANY MEMBERS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT TEACHER LICENSING AND THE BENEFITS WE HAVE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. I'M SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THE LEGISLATION LEGISLATION SB TOTAL NINE CALIFORNIA HAS REALLY PUSH TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS FOR OUT OF STATE PREPARED EDUCATORS ACROSS ALL STATES. SO AT THIS POINT CALIFORNIA HAS A TWO TIERED CREDENTIALING SYSTEM. THE MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COMING FROM OUT OF STATE REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY'RE MILITARY SPOUSE OR NOT IS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FROM REGIONALLY ACCREDITED INSTITUTION. A FINGERPRINT CLEARANCE AND A WRIST RECIPROCAL OUT OF STATE TEACHING LICENSE SO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AN INDIVIDUAL DOES NEED TO COMPLETE WITHIN ONE TO FIVE YEARS OF THEIR INITIAL LICENSING IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE SECOND YOUR CREDENTIAL WHICH IS THE CLEAR CREDENTIAL. BUT IT JUST KIND OF WANT TO LEAVE OUT FOUNDATION AS WE TALK ABOUT SOME MORE SPECIFIC BENEFITS THAT THE COMMISSION OFFERS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. SO WE HAVE AT THREE MAIN BENEFITS THAT WE HAVE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES A LOT OF WHICH KELLY SPOKE TO YOU EARLIER AROUND THE APPLICATION PROCESSING FEE AND THE EXPEDITING ABOUT LOCATIONS WE DO YOU OFFER THE- MILITARY SPOUSE FEE WAIVER AND THAT WAS THE FIRST ITEM I MET TALK ABOUT. ON THAT WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST OF TWO THOUSAND TEN. AND AB AT SEVEN NINETY FOUR DIRECTED THE COMMISSION TO WAIVE THE INITIAL PROCESSING FEE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES IF THEY RELOCATE TO CALIFORNIA BASED ON ANY RELOCATION ORDERS FROM ANY UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. SO THIS IS AVAILABLE FOR A SPOUSE'S INITIAL TEACHING CREDENTIAL BUT THE INITIAL TEACHING CREDENTIAL OF ANY TYPE OFTEN MILITARY SPOUSES ARE CREDENTIALED IN MULTIPLE AREAS THEY MIGHT BE CREDENTIALED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION IN GENERAL EDUCATION. SO WOULD BE FOR THE INITIAL CREDENTIAL TYPE EITHER SPECIAL EDUCATION OR AN INITIAL GENERAL EDUCATION CREDENTIAL. SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WE'VE HAD NEARLY A THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS UTILIZE THIS FEE WAIVER. AND THAT'S ABOUT A LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS PER YEAR COMING IN TO OBTAIN THIS FEE WAIVER. I'M RECENTLY AND TWO THOUSAND EFFECTIVE JAN FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A. B. TWO TWENTY SIX RECTOR THE COMMISSION TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING A MILITARY SPOUSE APPLICATIONS IF THEY'RE COMING IN BASED ON OUT OF STATE PREPARATION. THE COMMISSION HAS A FIFTY BUSINESS STATE MANDATED PROCESSING REQUIREMENT I'M SO WE HAVE FIFTY BUSINESS DAYS TO PROCESS AN APPLICATION THAT COMES SAID OFTENTIMES WERE WELL BELOW THAT FIFTY BUSINESS DAY PROCESSING BUT SOMETIMES IN THE BUSY SEASON WE CAN HIT. UP TO FIFTY BUSINESS DAYS FOR MILITARY SPOUSES EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING OF THE APPLICATION AND GIVE THEM A DETERMINATION ON THEIR APPLICATION WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF US PHYSICALLY RECEIVING THAT APPLICATION. SO IF THE INDIVIDUAL QUALIFIES BASED ON THE MATERIAL SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION WE'RE GONNA GRANT APPLICATION WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF RECEIPT. IF THEY NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO US WE'RE GONNA GET THEM THAT LETTER IN WRITING VERIFYING THAT WE'VE PROCESS THEIR APPLICATION AND TELLING THEM EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED FROM THEM. TO CONTINUE PROCESSING SO THAT IS A VERY RECENT CHANGE AND LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE IMPLEMENTING AS WE SPEAK. AND THEN THE LAST. SECTION A STATUE THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT IS SPECIFICALLY FOR VETERANS OR ACTIVE MILITARY SERVICE. MEMBERS WHO HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL OR PERMIT. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY ARE CALLED OUT ON FOR ACTIVE DUTY THEIR DOCUMENT IS. REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL SIX MONTHS PASS A BEAR DISCHARGE THEIR THEIR DISCHARGED FROM SERVICE SO THEIR CREDENTIAL WOULD NOT EXPIRE IT WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT THEY WOULD CONTACT THEIR LOCAL EMPLOYING AGENCY. TO ENSURE THAT THEIR EMPLOYER UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR DOCUMENT REMAINS IN EFFECT AND ALSO WITH THE COMMISSION WE WOULD MAINTAIN THE VALIDITY OF THEIR DOCUMENT UP TO SIX MONTHS. AFTER THEIR DISCHARGE FROM SERVICE IT'S A REALLY THOSE THREE MAIN STATUTORY AREAS ARE WHERE WE HAVE THE MILITARY BENEFITS WE ARE CONSTANTLY STRIVING TO IDENTIFY OTHER AREAS WHERE WE CAN REDUCE THE BARRIERS FOR ALL HONESTY APPLICANTS AND THAT WOULD DEFINITELY INCLUDING AFFECT MILITARY SPOUSES. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT AND FINALLY EVELYN AND WITH THE LAWYERS. I A MILLION YES IS FOR THE STATE BAR. GOOD AFTERNOON HAD CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M A MEANING AS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ADMISSIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED FOR US MILITARY SPOUSES SO THIS IS A REGISTERED RELEASED MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY PROGRAM WHICH IS A SPECIAL ADMISSIONS PROGRAM. ALLOWING A LICENSING OF FOR A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS. SO THE IMPETUS FOR THIS PROGRAM STARTED WITH. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL WHICH ARE DIRECTED STAFF TO LOOK AT OUR SPECIAL ADMISSIONS RULES TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A WAY TO FACILITATE A SPECIAL EDITIONS AND TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LEGAL SERVICES AND A THAT REQUIRE THAT WE LOOK AT OUR THREE SEPARATE PROGRAMS SO WE HAVE THREE SPECIAL ADMISSIONS PROGRAMS ARE FIRST IS THE REGISTERED IN HOUSE COUNSEL WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE FACT. OF FOR SOME TIME AS WELL AS OUR REGISTER LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEY THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW TEMPORARY LICENSING FOR OF OUT OF STATE OF ATTORNEYS TO COME TO CALIFORNIA PRACTICE WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE THE BAR EXAM. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS SO WE WERE ABLE TO USE THOSE PROGRAMS TO LOOK AT REGISTERED OF MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY. SO TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE MILITARY SPOUSES JD NETWORK WITH ESTABLISHED OF TO AIDS SPOUSES OF MILITARY A SERVICE MEMBERS IN FINDING EMPLOYMENT. AS ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE OR TERRITORY TO WHICH THEY'RE ACTIVE MILITARY SPOUSES BEEN ASSIGNED SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY THIRTY ONE STATES IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM THAT HAVE INCORPORATED A SPECIAL ADMISSIONS POLICY. AND SO. WE ARE ADOPTED THIS RULE ON MARCH FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT WENT INTO A FACT SPECIFICALLY WHAT OF THE PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA RULE NINETY NINE POINT FOUR POINT ONE DOES. IS IT ALLOWS ACTIVE ATTORNEYS IN GOOD STANDING IN A U. S. THERE'S A STATE OR A U. S. JURISDICTION WHO MUST BE MARRIED TO OR IN A CIVIL UNION WITH. A BE A REGISTERED DOMESTIC PARTNER OF A SERVICE MEMBER EXCEPT THAT THE ATTORNEY MAY CONTINUE TO PRACTICE AS A REGISTERED A MILITARY SPOTS ATTORNEY FOR ONE YEAR AFTER THE TERM. THAT MARRIAGE. IN ORDER MESSICK PARTNERSHIP UNDER IN CALIFORNIA WE INSURE THAT THE DEFINITION OF SPOUSE CONFORMS TO CALIFORNIA LOST SO THAT CIVIL UNIONS AND DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS WERE INCLUDED. WE ALSO DISTINGUISHED IN THE RULE THERE WAS A MODEL RULE THAT WAS. PROVIDED BY THE J. D. NETWORK WE WANTED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSIONS AND DISCIPLINARY MISCONDUCT. BECAUSE OF THE IN THE RULE IN THE MODEL RULE THERE WAS A THERE WAS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE SUSPENSIONS WHICH COULD INCLUDE SUSPENSIONS AS A RESULT OF NOT PAYING FEES SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE A BARRIER FOR MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS. WE ALSO INSURE THAT THE RULE ACCOMMODATES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO OF FOR THE BAR EXAM. SO IF ANYBODY HAS TAKEN THE BAR EXAM FIVE YEARS PRIOR IT NOT PASSED YOU NOT BE OF ELIGIBLE FOR A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY. PROGRAM HOWEVER ONCE YOU BECOME A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY. NO ATTEMPT AT THE BAR EXAM WHETHER YOU PASS OR FAIL WILL IMPACT THAT SO WE WANTED TO. ENSURE THAT THE BAR EXAM WOULD NOT BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE OF BECOMING AN ATTORNEY CALIFORNIA WE ALSO ADDED LANGUAGE IN THE RULE TO ENCOURAGE PRO BONO SO THAT SOMEONE. WHO IS A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY COULD ALSO PROVIDE PRO BONO SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA. SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE INITIALLY RECEIVED ABOUT THE RULE. IS THAT THERE IS A SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT TO THE RULE YOU NEED TO BE SUPERVISED BY ADULTS ACTIVE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY. AND SO THE US MILITARY SPOUSE G. D. NETWORK AND TOLD US THAT OR PROVIDE FEEDBACK THAT THE SUPERVISION PER COMPONENT COULD HINDER SOMEBODY'S ABILITY TO FIND EMPLOYMENT CALIFORNIA. AND IT MIGHT BE TOO ONEROUS FOR SOMEBODY TO EMPLOY A AN ATTORNEY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS. SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE ALSO RECEIVED FROM THE. THIS IS THE COMMISSION CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE OF PROVIDED FEEDBACK LETTING US KNOW THAT SUPERVISION WAS NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT A PART OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. THERE WAS ALSO CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER THE. THE RULES I HAD A DISPARATE IMPACT ON IT WOMEN ATTORNEYS THAT IS IF THEY WOULD LOSE REGISTRATION OF THROUGH OF SEPARATION OR DISSOLUTION OF THAT PARTNERSHIP. WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE TO EASE SOME OF THAT SO THAT WE YOU COULD AT THE STATE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA UNDER THIS PROGRAM AT LEAST ONE YEAR AFTER THE DISSOLUTION. IN TERMS OF THE SUPERVISION THE BOARD IS COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT A REVISITING THIS PART COMPONENT OF THE RULES TWO YEARS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION. TO ENSURE THAT WE STILL CARRY OUT PUBLIC PROTECTION BUT ALSO THAT THE PROGRAM IS A FISSION AND IS CARRIED OUT WITH IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHICH IS TO PROVIDE A SPECIAL ADMISSIONS OR ENTRY PASS. MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS. LASTLY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE HAVE ENROLLED SO THE ROLE WENT INTO A FACT. IN A MARCH OF THIS YEAR AND WE HAVE TO ACTIVE APPLICANTS AND ONE PENDING SO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO INCREASE OUR ENROLLMENT. OKAY. I GUESS ONE WOULD DISAGREE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THIS HOW DO WE EVALUATE YEAH THESE FIRST TWO ARGUMENTS RIGHT ONE SAYS THAT IT IT IS TOO ONEROUS THE OTHER ONE SAYS IT ISN'T. IS THE ISSUE OF BEING IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION THAT IF SOMEONE IS LICENSE IN ANOTHER STATE. THE STEEP ARE HERE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE ADEQUATE CONTROL OVER THE DISCIPLINARY RECORD. IS THAT THE BIG CONCERN I THINK THE CONCERN IS THE OF SETTING THEMSELVES IN COURT WITHOUT HAVING SOME SUPPORT SO OF THE RULE ITSELF WAS MODELED AFTER REGISTERED IN HOUSE COUNSEL UNDER BRIDGES JR A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY OF RULES AND ONE OF THOSE SO READ REGISTER LEGAL AID ATTORNEY DO NOT REPRESENT ANYBODY IN COURT REGISTERED IN HOUSE COUNSEL TO YOU UNDER DIRECT SUPERVISION SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE PROCEEDINGS AND BRIEFS PLEADINGS NEED TO BE SIGNED BY A SUPER SIR WE ADDED THAT. THE PUBLIC PROTECTION IN THIS WHAT I WANT TO DO I'M PROVIDE YOU WAS OF A DIFFERENT UP PERSPECTIVES LOT OF SURFACED AS WE WERE PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. RIGHT IS I GUESS WHAT I'M I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE. I A. YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF THESE LESSER CONVERSATIONS THERE'S ALWAYS THIS CONVERSATION A PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND I HAVEN'T. THE LITTLE BIT OF A LEASE THE DATE I'VE SEEN SOME OF ITS SHARED IN THIS PACKAGE I'D SUGGEST THAT THE IDEA THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF. ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE AND QUALITY OF THE PROFESSIONALS FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER. IS A PRETTY DUBIOUS NOW THERE ARE ISSUES THAT COME INTO PLAY WITH THEIR CARS TO ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE YOUR LICENSE WITH ONE STATE. HI AND THE OTHER STATE WHERE YOU'RE NOT PRACTICING DOESN'T REALLY HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER YOUR DISCIPLINARY RECORD OR ANY KIND OF LIKE. CONTROL OVER RESTRICTING YOUR ABILITY TO WORK IN THAT SECOND STATE BASED ON THINGS THAT YOU DO WRONG THEN THAT THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM THERE. AND I CAN TALK TO BE AN AREA OF SOME TENSION WITH REGARDS TO. TO LICENSOR PORTABILITY BUT I GUESS I WAS TRYING TO PARTS OF PARLIAMENT WHAT YOU WHAT YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT THE CCHA MATT WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC PROTECTION THEIR CROWDS TO. SUPERVISION WELL IT'S ONE OF THE MISSIONS OF THE STATE BAR IS TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROTECTION FOR ANYBODY ACCESSING A LEGAL SERVICES WE ALSO DID SOME ANALYSIS ON IN TERMS OF LICENSING OF WHAT OTHER JURISDICTION'S DOING IN TERMS OF SUPERVISION FOR MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS I THINK THERE ARE AT LEAST ELEVEN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THAT COMPONENT IS A REQUIREMENT. AS WELL AS MENTORING COMPONENT BUT IT WAS A LOT THERE WE DID GATHER A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND THAT TOPIC ITSELF WHICH IS WHY THE BOARD IS A COMMITTED TO REVISITING THIS ISSUE SO I'M TWO YEARS DOWN THE LINE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHAT KIND OF. IMPACT IT HAS LIKE IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY FOR MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS. AS WELL AS DISTANT IMPACT THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING. NOW I KNOW LAW HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF HOW DIFFERENT. STATE LAWS. CAN BE IN AND THE IMPACTS OF PROCEDURES AFTER BUT. I WANTED TO ALSO ASK YOU KNOW IF THERE'S THIS REPORT THAT CAME OUT OF UNIVERSITY MINISTERING TO THE REACH REPORT THAT IS ON THE MEMBERS YOU CAN SEE ON. TAB SEVEN. OF YOUR BOOKLETS AND IT COMES OUT THEY DID A REPORTING ON EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY LOOKING AT LEGISLATION LOOKING AT THE STATE OF PLAY THEY LOOKED AT VARIOUS. HI. DIFFERENT AREAS OF LICENSURE IN ONE OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AT THE END. WITH A FREE FUTURE EFFORTS COULD ADVOCATE TO MODIFY OUR EXISTING LEGISLATION AB ONE EIGHTY SIX AND IN NINETEEN OH FOUR TO READ OCCUPATIONAL BOARD SHALL ALLOW SHELL ALLOW LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT FOR SPOUSES NOW. YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S A JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WOULD JUST MEAN THAT LITERALLY. A LICENSE FROM ANOTHER STATE WOULD BE IMMEDIATE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY PORTABLE WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED. I HAVE ONE MORE SLIDE THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IT. YES SO THAT ONE ENDORSEMENT ONE EIGHTY SIX IS TEMPORARY LICENSE SO WE ARE I BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONE THAT IS A VERY LICENSURE FOR NINE PROGRAMS. MIA IF THERE. OF SO WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT IS. TAKING NINE AND EXPANDING IT RECOMMENDING THAT THAT STATES REALLY LOOK AT EXPANDING THAT THAT KIND OF POLICY WHICH IS BASICALLY AN EXTENDED TEMPORARY LICENSE THAT WOULD GIVE THAT WOULD DO TWO THINGS. BUT STILL TEMPORARY YES IT'S STILL A WELL AS FAR AS THE AT ONE EIGHTY SIX THAT WE'RE NOT IN THE WITH WITH THE REDS THIS RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT IS HERE THIS IDEA OF LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT OKAY SO THE LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT THOUGH IS SO WE KIND OF HAVE TO ASK FLEMING CAM BACK CHECK A LITTLE BIT. SO WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME STATES THAT HAVE EXPANDED BASICALLY LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT TO THIS TERM OF RECOGNITION SO WE WENT FROM. THIS FROM LOOKING AT IT FROM A WRIST RECIPROCITY STANDPOINT BECAUSE. REST OF RECIPROCITY INFERS THAT THERE'S A- MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN PARTIES WHICH WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT RECIPROCITY WHEN WE'RE ASKING FOR EXPANSION OF LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT TO IN BASICALLY BECOMING LICENSURE BY RECOGNITION ARIZONA AND RECENTLY PASSED A BILL H. B. TWENTY FIVE SIXTY NINE THAT ALREADY WAS AVAILABLE FOR SPOUSES THEY ACTUALLY DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THEY EXPANDED AND AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WAS ALREADY FOR SPOUSES TO THEIR GENERAL POPULATION SO NOW ANYONE COMING INTO ARIZONA WITH THE LICENSE OUT OF STATE. HAS THEIR FINGER PRINTING AND BACKGROUND CHECK DONE. THE I'M PAY THE FEE AND THEN DATE ESSENTIALLY GET AN ARIZONA LICENSE WITH BASICALLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE PREVIOUS STATE STATES LICENSE SHOWS THAT THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO PERFORM THAT POSITION THAT JOB. AND SO ARIZONA STAMPS THEIR THEIR THEIR LICENSE AND THEY GET A LICENSURE BY RECOGNITION FLORIDA DOES THAT TOO AND I AWAY ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT JUST FOR TEACHERS SO. THAT THE ENDORSEMENT PIECE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ASKING STATES TO LOOK AT THOSE STATES. GET THOSE OTHER THOSE OTHER MODELS AND AT LEAST FOR MILITARY SPOUSES ACKNOWLEDGING THAT MILITARY SPOUSES MOVE EVERY THREE TO FOUR YEARS BY THE TIME THEY GO THROUGH ALL THIS PROCESSING OF. THIS ALL ALL THIS PROCESS OF. OF GETTING AFFIDAVITS GETTING I ENDORSEMENTS FROM THEIR PREVIOUS EMPLOYERS GETTING ALL THEIR TRANSCRIPTS THEN HAVING THE BOARDS. SPEND SOME TIME EVALUATING WHETHER IT'S SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT WHICH IS USUALLY. SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT IS THE EASE. AT ST. SINCE BY ENDORSEMENTS THAT'S CAUSING THE UNDERLYING ISSUE FOR SPOUSES IS THAT THERE'S AN EVALUATION PROCESS WHERE CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE OR OTHER STATES BUT CALIFORNIAN THIS EXAMPLE WOULD LOOK AT. ALL THE COURSE WORK ALL OF THE EMPLOYMENT HISTORY EVERYTHING AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION IF THEY GET A CALIFORNIA LICENSE SO THERE'S THIS AND THIS DELAY CAUSED BY HAVING TO. SUBMIT ALL THOSE DOCUMENTS THEN WAIT FOR THE AT THE EVALUATION SO WE'RE ASKING FOR A LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT OR RECOGNITION WITHOUT. THIS LONG DRAWN OUT PROCESS OF EVALUATION OF STEP SUBSTANTIAL AND WE'RE ASKING FOR IT JUST A IN PERPETUITY OR FOR THE TIME THAT THEY ARE STATE THAT THERE THERE'S A HOUSES THE STATION. YES CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS AT DIFFERENT STATES DUE TO WE DON'T TELL THE STATE'S WHAT TO DO BUT WE WE'VE LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODELS AND I THINK FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS IS KIND OF THE THIS IS ONE FRAMEWORK. NUMBER ONE PROVIDE EXTENDED TEMPORARY LICENSE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES SO THAT THEY CAN GET A LICENSE WITH THEIR- FINGER PRINTING AND A BACKGROUND CHECK AND THEY'RE ON A VERIFICATION THAT THEIR LICENSES GOOD IN GOOD STANDING. THAT THEY WOULD FILL OUT THE% APPLICATION BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT APPLICATION EXPEDITED GET THEIR LICENSE AND THEN BE PROVIDED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY SUBSTANTIATING DOCUMENTS. THAT'S FOR IF THEY WANT A FULL ENDORSEMENT BUT IF THEY DON'T WANT A FULL ENDORSEMENT AND THEY JUST WANT TO WORK WHILE THEY'RE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE TWO TO THREE YEARS WE'RE ALSO ASKING STATES TO. CONSIDER JUST A LONG JUST A TEMPER EXTENDED TEMPORARY LICENSE THROUGH THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THEY'RE HERE. NOW THEY. DECIDE TO STAY LONGER THAN THEY WOULD NEED TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF. CONVERTING THEIR LICENSE INTO A FULL CALIFORNIA LICENSE. I GUESS MY QUESTION I'M- TO MISS SCHOOL AND MISS NEW YES IS WHAT WOULD BE. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THAT SORT OF PROPOSAL DOES THAT SOUND. REASONABLE DO A BALL IN YOUR RESPECTIVE PROFESSIONS. AM I THINK THE WE ARE HALFWAY THERE ALREADY I THINK THAT OUR INITIAL LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHING. IS A DOT THEY HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR REGIONALLY ACCREDITED COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. THAT THEY HAVE THE FINGERPRINT CLEARANCE AND THAT THE HAVE THAT COMPARABLE OUT OF STATE LICENSE SO I THINK THE ONLY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT WE HAVE FOR INITIAL LICENSURE IS THAT BACHELOR'S DEGREE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD. THE COMMISSION WOULD CONSIDER REMOVAL ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS PREPARED THE BACHELOR'S DEGREE YEAH I'M IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT WE SEE INDIVIDUALS COMING FROM OUT OF STATE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT BACHELOR'S DEGREE THOUGH THAT'S A VERY VERY RARE. HOWEVER WE ARE CEASING SOME INTERESTING THINGS HAPPENING OUT OF STATE WITH CONCERNS FOR TEACHER SHORTAGES SO THERE ARE SOME VERY INTERESTING LICENSURE PATHWAYS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW THAT COULD VERY WELL RESULT IN INDIVIDUALS COMING IN WITHOUT A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT AGAIN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN OFTEN I THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SPOKE TO REGARDING. MILITARY SPOUSES WAY TO COME IN FOR JUST TWO YEARS AND SERVING A TEMPORARY CAPACITY I'M IS A REALLY INTERESTING THOUGHT THAT I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION. TEACHING PERMIT REQUIRES A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA BASIC SKILLS EXAM. INDIVIDUALS CAN USE AN EXAM FROM OUT OF STATE IF THEY'VE TAKEN A COMPARABLE BASIC SKILLS EXAM THAT COVERS READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS. BUT IF THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT TYPE OF EXAM THAN AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT SEE BEST EXAM IN ORDER TO. EARNED THAT SUBSTITUTE TEACHING PERMIT IF THEY JUST WANT TO COME IN AND BE A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. I'M SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT TO SEE WHERE WE COULD MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS THERE AND POSSIBLY DO SOME TYPE OF BASIC SKILLS EXAM WEAVER OR SOMETHING FOR THESE MILITARY SPOUSES. I WENT OUT. AND FOR THE STATE BAR WE DON'T HAVE RECIPROCITY IS THAT RECIPROCITY PROGRAM OUTSIDE A MILITARY SPOUSE FAMILIES SHOW OF WE HAVE A UNIQUE SET UP IN TERMS OF WE DON'T USE FOR EXAMPLE THE UNIFORMED BARK THE UNIFORM BAR EXAM WHICH A LOT OF STATES DO YOU AND ALLOW RECIPROCITY FOR THAT REASON HOWEVER IN TERMS OF AN EXTENDED TEMPORARY LICENSE. BEDS I THINK WERE PARTIALLY THERE WITH OUR CURRENT PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE A DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH FINGERPRINT BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE FORM OF THE MORAL CHARACTER INVESTIGATION THAT OCCURS YOU'RE STILL ALLOWED TO WORK WHILE THAT A FORMAL PROCESSOR INVESTIGATION IS HAPPENING SO IN TERMS OF THE TEMPER LICENSING I THINK THAT'S NOT AN IMPEDIMENT. OKAY I WANT I WANT ONE FINAL QUESTION I WANT TO GO TO CHAIR A GLAZER AND THAT IS THIS ISSUE SO ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME UP AT THE COUNCIL STATE GOVERNMENTS. I'M KIND OF ONE DAY I DID A FULL DAY SESSION ON THIS THIS THIS ISSUE OF LICENSURE IS VERY INTERESTING. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT THAT STATES CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IS DISCIPLINARY RECORDS. AND WHO HOLD THOSE RECORDS HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S- ACCOUNTABILITY OF SOMEONE BEING A BEHAVES BADLY IN ONE STATE THAT THERE ARE SOME ACCOUNTABILITY OTHER STATES AND WE'RE NOT GONNA PASSING ON PROBLEMS. AND THIS IS A COURSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MINUSCULE PORTION OF CERTAINLY THE MILITARY SPOUSE POPULATION BUT IT'S THE KIND OF THING THEY CAN GET ALL OF OUR EFFORTS HUNG UP. I AND ONE OF THINGS I ASK YOUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE NORTHWEST WAS. ON BECAUSE THEY'RE SUCH. IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE YOU'VE FOLKS MOVING AROUND SO MUCH. MAYBE THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE OUGHT TO BE THE KEEPERS OF THE DATE OF THE DISCIPLINARY DATABASE. SO AS TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE. I YOU TO TRANSFER ALL TO. THE CREDENTIAL OURS. SO THAT YOU'LL ALL HAVE YOU KNOW COME A CREDIBLE PACKET TO LOOK AT IF THEY'RE IN A TO DO TO ENSURE THAT. THAT THAT THAT SOMEONE DOES NOT HAVE A DISCIPLINARY RECORD IN ANY STATE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A DUDE. THE THIRD THIRD JUST. ACCOUNTABILITY. IN ANSWERS ASSOCIATED THAT IT MAY ACTUALLY BE. AN APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THIS TO BE HOUSE AFTER YOU. ANYWAY I'D LOVE TO SEE IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK INTO THAT OF LAST MONTH AND IF YOU ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT ISSUE. I REMEMBER THAT QUESTION. OKAY SO I THINK TWO THINGS THOUGH THAT WE WE'RE LOOKING AT IS AND ONE IS THAT. THERE IS IT IS FAR AS DISCIPLINARY RECORDS AND VERIFYING. THAT KIND OF THING I THINK. THAT ISN'T REALLY THE PROBLEM THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE SO IF WITH MILITARY SPOUSE COMES THE CALIFORNIA AND SAYS I HAVE A LICENSE IN ARIZONA CALIFORNIA THAT BOARD. CAN CALLED THE BOARD AND THERE'S ON AND FIND OUT THAT SEE THAT'S THE EASY PART. THE OTHER PIECES THAT AS FAR AS DISCIPLINE GOES. WE HAVE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT SPOUSES BUT WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY SORT OF TRACKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY WORK FOR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. SO YOU KNOW I'M SAYING WE WERE KIND OF IN THIS SPACE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPORTING THE SERVICE MEMBER WHO'S WHO'S SERVING BUT WE CAN'T. THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY THAT. HAS SOARED OR IS IT IS ASKING THE TO THE EXTENT THIS HAS BECOME A PROBLEM I AN INMATE MAYBE IT WAS OVERSTATED THE CONFERENCE. I WAS WHAT MAYBE THEY'LL BE LIKE AN OPT IN OR SOMETHING WHERE WHERE WHERE THE SPOUSE WITH WOULD VOLUNTARILY. YOU KNOW. AUTHORIZED DEPARTMENT DEFENSE TO KIND OF. BE THE KEEPER OF THE- PACKAGE WE HAVE SO THAT SO THAT SO AS TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE. STATE BY STATE PORTABILITY I DON'T KNOW I. SO I THINK THAT AGAIN I THINK THAT THE MAIN ISSUE ISN'T SO ISN'T VERIFYING THEIR PREVIOUS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ON THAT'S ON THE BOARD. TYPICALLY THEY THEY HAVE A PROCESS FOR VERIFYING THAT THE PERSONS ASIDE. AS PREVIOUS THE- CERTIFICATION OR OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AS FAR AS KIND OF A PORTAL FOR HOLDING THEIR PREVIOUS SIX ALL OF THEIR PREVIOUS RECORDS. THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND MAY BE LOOKED AT. HOWEVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALSO SAY IS THAT. EVERY STATE IS SO DIFFERENT WITH THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND THEIR ENDORSEMENT PROCESS THAT SPOUSES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO ANTICIPATE AS FAR AS WHAT THEY NEED TO PROVIDE. SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE KIND OF THAT UNKNOWN. OKAY WITH WITH I KNEW WHAT CALIFORNIA EXPECTED NOW WHAT IS FLORIDA EXPECT WHAT IS VERGING EXPECTS SO. I JUST THINK THAT THE- THE DIFFERENCES. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO MITIGATE TWO IS THE IS JUST TRYING TO. RESOLVE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE STATE TO STATE DIFFERENCES. AND WHICH WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE WE WHEN I WENT ON THE PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT JUST TRYING TO MITIGATE THAT. SO I DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION AND THAT'S NOT THERE. MAY BE SOME SORT OF PORTAL WOULD HELP SPOUSES. I DON'T KNOW THEY THE VISIBILITY OF THE DOD PROVIDING THAT BUT I DON'T TO SOMEBODY. THE FIVE POINT YOU KNOW THAT YES INDEED IN TALKING WITH RADIO. SERIES YOU'RE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE STANCE BUT TO THE EXTENT OF THAT CAME UP. AT THE CONFERENCE AS AN ISSUE I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE CONTACT THAT THEY DID WITH REGARD TO NURSE PRACTITIONERS. THAT I THINK WHAT TWELVE FIFTY STATES HAVE JOINED. I'M DAVE DAVE. YOU KNOW THEIR RIGHT TO THEIR THEIR SOME OF THOSE CONTACTS THEY HAVE THEY'VE THEY'VE THEY'VE CREATED SOME SORT OF PORTAL FOR DISCIPLINARY RECORDS IN YES AND I THINK THAT'S ITS I DIE WILL I'M GLAD THAT I CAN I SAY GRAY OFF OF THAT BECAUSE MY FINAL POINT I WANTED TO SAY IS DEPARTMENT OFFENSES ACTUALLY. THEY'RE REINVENTING LICENSING PORTABILITY BY PROVIDING HOME STATE LICENSEES WITH PRIVILEGES TO PRACTICE AND OTHER MEMBER STATES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS THERE'S AND IT'S AN AGREEMENT AMONG MEMBER STATES SO THEY'VE ALREADY AGREED TO THESE BASELINE REQUIREMENTS SO ONCE OF US MILITARY'S OR ANYONE AND THAT'S THE OTHER GOOD THING IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST FOR MILITARY SPOUSES SO IT DOESN'T. CREATE KIND OF THAT SPECIAL CLASS THAT THAT PERCEPTION THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE AFRAID OF AND THEY STREAMLINED STREAMLINED REQUIREMENTS ACROSS STATES ALLOWING PROFESSIONALS TO BEGIN WORKING RIGHT AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES REGISTERED WITH THEIR HOME STATE WHILE PROVIDING PUBLIC PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE PROCESS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEY A LOT OF THEM HAVE THAT KIND OF ALREADY HAVE A PORTAL. FOR TRACKING THEIR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE REGISTERED UNDER THE CONTACT SO COMPACTS ARE THE ONLY REAL TRUE RECIPROCITY THE EXISTING MEMBER STATES BECAUSE IT IS TRULY AN AGREEMENT AMONG THE MEMBERS AND JUST WANT TO POINT OUT HERE JUST THOSE NUMBERS THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE STATES HAVE APPROVED THE PHYSICAL THERAPY LICENSE OR COMPACT THIRTY THREE NURSE LICENSURE. COMPACT EMT COMPACT EIGHTEEN STATES HAVE APPROVED A AND THE PSYCHOLOGY COMPACT TEN HAVE APPROVED SO FAR AND THERE'S OPEN LEGISLATION AND ALL OF THOSE CONTACTS AND ALSO A NEW COMPACT IS HAS BEEN STARTED FOR TWO TWENTY TWENTY WHICH IS SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY. AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT FORTY STATES HAVE PASSED OVER AT COMPAQ'S IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF NINE WITH NINE APPROVED. SO WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT HERE. SENATE GLAZER THANK YOU CHAIR ALLEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S ENLIGHTENING AND APPRECIATED AND I DON'T WANT MY QUESTION TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD BECAUSE THE DELAY FOR ONE PERSON THAT DID NOT FOR ONE IS TOO MANY. KLAY FOR OUR MILITARY SPOUSES BUT- I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY ANY FACTS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. OKAY I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SPOUSES IN A FEW MINUTES AND I'M SURE THEY'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT GIVE US SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES WHICH IS HELPFUL. BUT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE YOU HAVE FACTS ON HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM THAT IS IN CALIFORNIA. SO IT IT'S KIND OF HARD RIGHT NOW BASED ON AND I'M JUST NOT. IN THE PAST NOT REALLY HAVING A MECHANISM FOR TRACKING THESE THINGS I THINK LIKE ISN'T. AS APRIL WAS SAYING THERE'S- NOW THERE'S KIND OF. THERE'S A WAY TO KIND OF COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOARD AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY'RE GETTING. BUT THE ONLY THING WE REALLY. THE ONLY INFORMATION I HAD AS FAR AS DATA WAS ON THE DC A- REPORT THAT WAS PUT OUT IN APRIL. THAT JUST STATED. KIND OF THAT SATISFACTION LEVEL OR THE RESPONSE LEVEL THAT THEY WERE GETTING FROM BOARDS BUT IT WASN'T REALLY PARTICULAR TO HOW LONG IT TOOK. OKAY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS YOU TALKED ABOUT WAYS IN WHICH YOU TRY TO FACILITATE. THANK YOU FOR THAT APPRECIATE IT AND I KNOW. YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED IN WE'RE ALL NOT SATISFIED AND WE CAN DO MORE. BUT YOU HAVE ANY FACTS ABOUT HOW MANY AND MILITARY SPOUSES BEEN TURNED DOWN. OR ANYTHING ANY FACTS ABOUT THE DELAYS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. NO I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION HANDY BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT TO YOUR OFFICE I WOULD CERTAINLY BE HELPFUL AND TO. THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM DEAD. TEACHER CREDENTIALING DO YOU HAVE ANY FACTS ON HOW MANY. MILITARY SPELLS HAVE BEEN TURNED DOWN OR THE DELAYS AND THE PROCESSING OF THEIR LICENSURE. AT NO NOT SPECIFICALLY THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING AT BEST OKAY IN THE STATE BAR SAME QUESTION AS I MENTIONED WE WILL RECEIVE THREE APPLICATIONS TO HAVE BEEN ADMITTED AND ONE IS PENDING. SO I CAN IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY DELAYS OKAY WELL MY QUESTION OBVIOUSLY ELIMINATES A CHALLENGE FOR US WE WANT TO DO BETTER WE NOW IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO MORE. BY WE DO NEED SOME FACTUAL BASIS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND- AND- TO SOME LIMITED EXTENT THE STATE BAR HAS SOME INFORMATION BUT I THINK IT. POINTS OUT A BLIND SPOT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND I MEAN I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE TESTIMONY IN A FEW MINUTES AND- AND THAT WILL GET ELIMINATED SOME EXTENT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A BODY OF FACTS. THANK YOU MISTER HERE. SENATE ROTH THANK YOU AND I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO THANK THE STATE BAR FOR STEPPING OUT ON THIS. IN OF MEN MS NINE YEARS REMEMBERS OUR NOSE BUT THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS. FIRST BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE ISSUE BUT ATTORNEYS IN PRACTICE. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AT THE STATE BAR'S BEEN WORKING ON IT AND FINALLY SOMETHING IS COME TO FRUITION NAY I FOR ONE APPRECIATE IT. I CAN ADDRESS MY COLLEAGUES COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO. THE LAWYERS BUT BEING FIRST LICENSED IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND THEN COMING TO CALIFORNIA TO WORK FOR OF. A NON MILITARY GOVERNMENT AGENCY EVENTUALLY AS A NON CALIFORNIA LAWYER AND TAKING THE CALIFORNIA BAR AND- FORTUNATELY THEY MADE A MISTAKE IN THE ADMITTED ME. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE BAR RELEASED ELICITS CHANGES GIVEN TWICE A YEAR. SO IF YOUR MILITARY SPOUSE YOU MOVED TO CALIFORNIA BY THE TIME YOU FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THE- COURSES IN WORDS GIVEN TO STUDY FOR THE BAR YOU GO THROUGH THE- MONTHS LONG PROCESS OF STUDYING FOR THE BAR YOU FINALLY TAKE THE BAR EXAM YOU THEN WAIT MONTHS FOR THE BAR EXAM TO BE SCORED. AND YOU GET YOUR RESULT. YOUR RELATED THE GAME THE YOU THEN LOOK START LOOKING FOR A JOB. YOU WILL TO MILLY FIND A JOB AND YOUR MILITARY MEMBER SPOUSE GETS ORDERS AND IS REASSIGNED EITHER BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR JOB OR WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF SECURING IT THAT'S A- A COUNTERPRODUCTIVE PROCESS AND WHILE THAT IS NOT THE SAME I ASSUME QUITE THE SAME PROCESSES WITH TEACHER CREDENTIALING. OR WITH THE OCCUPATIONS AND PROFESSIONS OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEALS WITH IT IS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS I'M AS I UNDERSTAND THE RULE YOU CAN PRACTICE FOR FIVE YEARS AS A REGISTERED MILITARY SPOUSE. AND I THINK THAT'S EXCELLENT THAT THAT SORT OF BRIDGES THAT PERIOD OF TIME WHEN A MILITARY FAMILY IS GOING TO. GET HERE THEN WERE CUTER AND SEE YOUR ORDERS AND THEN MOVE ON AND AT SOME POINT YOU DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO STAY HERE. AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THE CALIFORNIA BAR FOR AN ATTORNEY. AND GO INTO PRACTICE I WOULD LIKE TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT ON THE ON TWO THINGS ONE THE SUPERVISION ISSUE AND ONE. TIME IN PRACTICE IF THAT'S STILL AN ISSUE FIRST THE SUPERVISION IF I HAVE THE CURRENT COPY OF THE- THE RULE OR THE REGULATION THE DUTIES OF THE EMPLOYER. APPEAR TO INVOLVE COMPLETING AN APPLICATION AND SIGNING A DECLARATION. AND THEN GENERALLY OVERSEEING THE WORK OF THE LAWYER DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. TWO DIFFERENT THAN THE FUNCTION I PERFORMED IN MY PURSE ONE OF MY PRAYER LIVES WHEN I MANAGE A LAW FIRM. OF PARTNERS AND ASSOCIATES WE HAVE SOME MENTORSHIP AND SUPERVISORY. RESPONSIBILITY IS THERE ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT I JUST READ IN THIS RULE. NO THERE'S NOTHING BEYOND THE ROLE SO IS A REGISTERED TO A- MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY ENTITLED TO SIGN A PLEADING. IT WITH SIGN OFF FROM THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY THEY CAN BUT YOUR BUT THIS BILL TO MILITARY SPOUSES SIGNATURE WOULD BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PLEADING. WITH SOME CALIFORNIA BAR NUMBER ATTACHED TO IT. OKAY WELL THEN. LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION HAVING TO DO WITH TIME AND PRACTICE SO I ASSUME. IF THAT'S STILL AN ISSUE TIME AND PRACTICES RELEVANT TERMS OF WILL WHICH BAR EXAM YOU TAKE PERHAPS IS THAT STILL DO YOU STILL IF YOU PRACTICE MORE THAN FIVE OR SIX YEARS IN CALIFORNIA DO YOU STILL GET TO TAKE AN ATTORNEY'S BAR EXAM. I'M SO SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT ONE MORE TIME. THE TIME IN PRACTICE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH. YOUR TIME THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY SPENT PRACTICINGAND WHAT YOU QUALIFIED TO TAKE IF YOU'RE TAKING A BURKE SAM. I ASSUME. AND THIS CALIFORNIA'S STILL OFFER A OF A SEPARATE BURKE SAM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN. PRACTICE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS. YES SO BUT THE TIME PRACTICE REFERS TO THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY'S TIME AND PRACTICE. OKAY WELL MAYBE YOU COULD WELL THIS IS THE OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT IN THE NOTES THAT SOMEONE GAVE ME A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY DOES NOT ACCRUE TIME AND PRACTICE UNDER RULE NINE POINT FORTY ONE POINT ONE. BUT YOU SAY THE A TIME IN PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS RELATES TO THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY'S. LET ME GET TO THAT PORTION OF THE RULE. AND I MAY NOT HAVE THE COMPLETE RULE. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OBJECTIONS ARE I'M SURE OUT HERE FROM THE MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEYS I THINK THE NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS TOO SO THE SUPERVISING ATTORNEY NEEDS TO HAVE AT LEAST FOUR YEARS OF PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA OKAY SO IF I'M A REGISTERED MILITARY SPOUSES TWO YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. IF I'M A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY AND I PRACTICE HERE. FOR FIVE YEARS WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM UNDER THE RULE. AND I'VE HAD THREE YEARS OF PRACTICE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. FOR A TOTAL OF EIGHT YEARS WHICH BAR EXAM BUT I TAKING CALIFORNIA THE ATTORNEYS BURKE SAM OR THE BAR EXAM THE SAME BAR EXAM BUT SOMEBODY POPPING OUT OF LAW SCHOOL WOULD TAKE WELL I HAVE ONE CAT SO IF YOU ARE COMING FROM ANOTHER JURISDICTION UNDER THE REGISTERED MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY YOU HAVE TO HAVE PRACTICED IN YOUR HOME JURISDICTION OR ANOTHER JURISDICTION FOR FOUR YEARS AGO BUT SO I HAVE NINE YEARS YOU HAVE NINE YEARS SO IF I HAVE NINE YEARS WHAT I TAKE WHICH BAR EXAM WHEN I TAKE IN CALIFORNIA. ATTORNEYS ATTORNEYS EXAM PERFECT THANK YOU TWENTY EXAM THANK YOU THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING THIS ON THANK YOU MISTER OSCAR. OKAY AB TARANTULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK THIS IS A BIGGER PICTURE THAT THE ADD ROLE AND I ARE VERY MUCH INVOLVED IN BACK AT ROLE BECAUSE OF THE GOVERNOR'S COUNCIL AND THAT IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. TO KEEP THEM IN THE MILITARY AS LONG AS WE POSSIBLY CAN SO THIS OUT REACH PROGRAM TO KEEP THE SPOUSES INVOLVED ALSO KIND OF WORK TOGETHER. THE OTHER THING WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE AS AN EXAMPLE IN THE MARINE CORPS HERE AND CAMP PENDLETON WE RELEASE ABOUT NINE THOUSAND MARINES A YEAR AND- THEY GO OFF. AND THEY DON'T STATE CALIFORNIA SO THAT EXPERTISE WHATEVER IT IS WE LOSEIT. IF WE CAN USE THAT ARM TO KEEP THE WIVES EMPLOYED BECOME PROFESSIONALS IN WHATEVER CAPACITY THEY CAN MORE THAN LIKELY WILL KEEP THE- VOTERS MARINES SAILORS WITH US. SO I SEE IT'S WORKING HAND IN HAND AND OF COURSE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF YOU CAN MINE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE STATE. SO I CONGRATULATE YOU OFFER WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT JUST LET YOU KNOW ADMIRAL THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO WERE. ON THE COMMITTEE THE COUNCIL THAT I WOULD JUST APPOINTED TO WAS TALKING JUST ABOUT THIS AND HOW WE CAN HELP THE SPOUSES HOW WE CAN HELP. THE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM HOW WE COULD MAKE SURE THAT OUR MILITARY. THIS IS OUR OUR OUR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE AND FREE AND JUST EVERYONE WORKING TOGETHER SO RIGHT NOW THE SPIRIT IN CALIFORNIA IS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH EVERYONE AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT TIME FOR YOU TO APPEAR. BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE EMPHASIZED TO UP HOW MUCH WE CAN PARTNER WITH YOU IS A STATE. AND HOW MUCH. THE VALUE YOU BRING. TO OUR OUR OUR DISPELLED BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY WOMEN RIGHT NOW SERVING. SO WHEN USE YOUR SPOUSE I JUST DON'T THINK OF WOMEN I THINK OF MEN AS WELL. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE WOMEN ARE ARE ARE SHIPPING AND THEY REACH HIGH RANKS IS THAT RIGHT TO ADMIRAL. YES THEY DO. SO I CONGRATULATE YOU BEING HERE AND SO I HOPE TO SUPPORT YOU AS CHAIR OF. MILITARY COMMITTEE AND NOW ON THE ON THE COUNSEL FOR THE GOVERNOR. SO IF THERE IS ANYTHING IN SPECIFIC THAT YOU'D LIKE TO. BRING TO US TODAY THAT WE CAN HELP YOU WITH PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THE ROOM WITHOUT GIVING IT TO US. SPECIFICALLY THAT IS ON THE HORIZON THAT YOU NEED IS TAKE A LOOK AT. IS THERE ANYTHING THERE IF YOU'RE THINKING OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERHAPS GO BACK TELL US LIFE. WELL LET ME JUST SAY THIS IS KIND OF PIGGY BACKING TO ON ON ON SENATOR GLAZERS POINT THE LAST KIND OF REQUEST ADDING FOR US AS WE WENT AT IT TOO YOU KNOW WE NEED THAT INFORMATION SO I THINK YOU KNOW LOOKING AT IS THERE A WAY FOR ALL LICENSING BOARDS IN CALIFORNIA. OR ENTITIES TO. BY SOME SORT ANNUAL KIND OF REPORT ON THIS IN WHICH IT WHICH WOULD BE A AYE AND IMPLEMENTATION BUT ALSO ON YOU KNOW. HOW MANY SOURCES OF COME TO YOU HOW MANY ACTIVE DUTY HAVE COME TO YOU HOW MANY. DISCIPLINARY EVEN REPORTS DO YOU HAVE JUST SO WE HAVE THAT DATA BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT EITHER. AND I THINK A REPORT. THAT MAYBE I'D. I COORDINATED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S MILITARY COUNCIL MIGHT BE GOOD. GENERAL WELL LET ME JUST SAY THIS SERVE AS TO THAT GENERAL POINT YOU KNOW. I THINK OUR STATE AID BOARDS AND AGENCIES NEED TO LOOK INTERNALLY WE KNOW THAT MILITARY FAMILIES MOVE TYPICALLY EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS SOMETIMES LONGER DEPENDING ON WHAT THE PARTICULAR SERVICE BRANCHES AND WHAT THE. THE OCCUPATIONAL CODE IS AND OTHER SITUATIONS BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA MOVE EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS AND YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR INTERNAL PROCESS SEES. AND IS SOMEONE WHO MOVES EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS AND THEN MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND THEY GET THE FAMILY GET THE HOUSE HOLD GOODS IN THE HOUSE FIRST OF ALL TO GET A HOUSE. OR AN APARTMENT THEY GET THE STUFF IN THE HOUSE OF THE APARTMENT. THEY GET THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL. THEY THEN FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY'RE LIVING. AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND TAKE THE OCCUPATION THE LICENSE THE FIELD WHATEVER THERE IS THEIR CAREER AND TRY TO GO TO WORK. HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE FROM THE TIME THEY HIT CALIFORNIA TO THE TIME THEY GET THROUGH YOUR PROCESS IN ORDER TO GET. APPLY FOR BE INTERVIEWED BY AND SELECTED FOR A JOB IF IT'S. IF IT'S EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO TWO YEARS. TOTAL TIME THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR THESE MILITARY FAMILIES AND SO AS WITH THE BAR EXAM WAITING FOR THE BAR TEST AND THE SCORES AND THE ALL THE REST THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HARRIS COMPRESS THAT TIME HOWEVER WE DO IT SO THAT SOMEBODY CAN GET HERE GET THE HOUSE THE APARTMENT GET THE KIDS IN SCHOOL GET THROUGH YOUR PROCESS AND THEN HAVE SOME USEABLE PERIOD OF TIME. IN ORDER TO WORK OTHERWISE IT'S NOT WORTH THE EFFORT EVEN IF THE DOD. GIVES US FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS FOR A. CUNNINGHAM FREE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE AND I THINK THAT GOES TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS TALKING ABOUT HERE WHETHER WE HAVE ANY STATISTICS TO BACK IT UP OR NOT. WE KNOW HOW LONG. WE FOR WE KNOW WHAT OUR STATISTICS ARE PROCESSING STATISTICS ARE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW AS A STATED INTERNALLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU WELL THIS IS GREAT REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF FAITH OR THEIR- COMMUNICATION. BOTH WITH WITH ALL THE COMMITTEES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE TODAY AND I'M EACH AND EVERYONE OF THESE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND- THANKS FOR COMMITTED TO OUR MILITARY FAMILIES. OKAY SO WHAT'S NEXT PLUS TAX ACTUALLY HEAR FROM SOME MILITARY SPOUSES. NOW IS WITH JAMISON IS COFOUNDER MISSION LICENSE SO SONYA TRAFFIC WHO'S A CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER IN ALEXANDER JOHNSON WHO'S ACT ACTUALLY CO FOUNDER THE MILITARY SPOUSE PROFESSIONAL NETWORK AT TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE HERE IN IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA START WITH YOU MISS JAMIESON. THE SUN OKAY. CHALLENGER GLAZER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. TRIANGLE QUICK BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE INSURED ON TIME HERE. MY NAME IS WOULD BE JAMESON AND I AM A PROUD NAVY SPOUSE AN ATTORNEY AND THE CO FOUNDER OF MISSION LCENSE WHICH IS A MILITARY SUPPOSED ON BUSINESS HELPING PROFESSIONALS NAVIGATE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BARRIERS. I'M ALSO THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE MILITARY SPOUSE TREATY NETWORK WHICH WAS REFERENCED BY THE BAR HEY AND I THINK WAS ALSO REFERENCE OUR EFFORTS STARTING BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. TO ENACT A AN ATTORNEY ON LICENSING ROLE IN THE STATE. OF MY HUSBAND'S A NAVY HELICOPTER PILOT SERVING AT NAVAL STATION NORTH ISLAND IN CORONADO. AND IT'S MY GREAT HONOR TO SUPPORT HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF HIS TWENTY THREE YEARS OVER TWENTY THREE YEARS OF SERVICE. HOWEVER THAT COMMITMENT COMES AT A COSTS NOT ONLY TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS PROTEST BUT TO THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL. I'D LIKE TO START BY DRAWING YOUR ATTENTION TO AN NBC NEWS STORY FROM JULY TWELFTH ENTITLED WIRE MANY OF MILITARY WHY ARE MANY OF AMERICA'S MILITARY FAMILIES GOING HUNGRY. THE STORY HIGHLIGHTED THE STRUGGLE OF A SAN DIEGO FAMILY AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ROUTINELY RELY ON ASSISTANCE TO MAKE ENDS MEET.DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN SAN IN CITIES LIKE SAN DIEGO AND THE TRANSIENT MILITARY LIFESTYLE THAT MAKES IT CHALLENGING FOR SPOUSES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF THEIR FAMILIES. WE'RE HERE TODAY DISCUSSING THAT LAST ISSUE CHALLENGES TO MILITARY SPOUSES MAINTAINING MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS. IN TANGENTIALLY BUT AS OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ESTIMATED THAT THE SPOUSE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AS HIGH AS TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. MILITARY SPOUSES FIND THEMSELVES IN A CONSTANT RECESSION THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS WOMEN. SINCE 92% OF A DUTY SPOUSES ARE FEMALE THESE FEMALE SPOUSES EARN ON AVERAGE 25% LESS THAN THEIR CIVILIAN COUNTERPARTS. THESE NUMBERS ARE THE RESULT OF MANY OF A MULTIPLE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS INCLUDING EMPLOYERS LACKING IN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MILITARY LIFESTYLE THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE AND OVERLY BURDENSOME OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS. MY STORY HIGHLIGHTS THE CHALLENGES WITH LICENSING I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL IN SAN DIEGO PASSED THE CALIFORNIA BAR AND EVENTUALLY STARTED MY OWN FIRM IN SAN DIEGO. THEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE MY HUSBAND EMAILED ME FROM AFGHANISTAN TO SAY THAT THE NAVY WAS RELOCATING HIM TO FLORIDA UPON HIS RETURN. HE WOULD BE ISSUED ORDERS FOR A PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION WHICH I FIND TO BE A VERY IRONIC TERM BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING PERMANENT ABOUT BEING IN THE MILITARY. A MILITARY FAMILIES MOVE ON AVERAGE EVERY TWO OR THREE YEARS I IMMEDIATELY RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT IN ORDER TO CONTINUE WORKING IN FLORIDA AS AN ATTORNEY I WOULD HAVE TO SIT FOR YET ANOTHER BAR EXAM. I WOULD HAVE BEEN MY THIRD AFTER CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON STATE ON THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXAMINATION A PREP COURSE ALL OF THE PREPARATION THAT GOES INTO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALSO WING INTO MY DECISION MAKING WAS WOULD I BE ABLE TO BUILD A NEW CLIENT BASE SIR YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT YOU KNOW WITH THOSE LIMITED WINDOW OF TIME THAT WE HAVE WOULD I BE ABLE TO BUILD A NEW CLIENT BASE. OR WOULD I BE ABLE TO FIND SOMEONE TO HIRE ME UP IN A PLACE WHERE I HAD NO PROFESSIONAL NETWORK. COMMITTEE I DECIDED NOT TO SIT FOR THIRD EXAM. AS THE TIMING AND IT. DIDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US. WE MOVED THREE MORE TIMES. BEFORE RETURNING TO SAN DIEGO LAST YEAR SO WE MOVED FOUR TIMES IN SIX YEARS. IT WAS QUITE SIMPLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CYCLE OF MOVING. TAKING A BAR EXAMINATION AND FINDING A NEW A NEW JOB IN EACH NEW LOCATION. I QUESTIONED WHETHER IT COULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND SERVICE WITHOUT LOSING MY OWN CAREER AND A PIECE OF MYSELF. FORTUNATELY I DISCOVERED THE MILITARY SPOUSE TREATING NETWORK. OF OUR ASSOCIATION FOR MILITARY SPOUSES AND CONNECTED WITH OVER TWELVE HUNDRED OTHER ATTORNEYS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR CAREERS. WE BANDED TOGETHER TO ADVOCATE FOR CHANGES TO LICENSING RULES. AND I'M PROUD TO REPORT THE NUMBERS ACTUALLY THIRTY EIGHT SO THIS WAS US IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN WE FIRST STARTED. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THIS IS WHAT THE MAP LOOKS LIKE TODAY SO THERE ARE NOW THIRTY EIGHT JURISDICTIONS. THAT HAVE SOME SORT OF LICENSING ACCOMMODATION FOR A MILITARY SPOUSE ATTORNEY. AS OF MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN THAT INCLUDES CALIFORNIA WHICH I WILL RETURN TO IN A MOMENT. NOW I RECOGNIZE THAT ATTORNEYS ARE NOT GENERALLY A SYMPATHETIC GROUP. BUT I DISCOVERED THAT THIS ISSUE IS MUCH GREATER THAN MY OWN EXPERIENCE. AS I THINK IT WAS REFERENCED ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL ALMOST 34% OF MILITARY SPOUSES REQUIRE A LICENSE TO WORK ACROSS THE PROFESSIONS. WHEN DONE RIGHT OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BENEFITS BOTH WORKERS AND CONSUMERS. HOWEVER MY EXPERIENCE IS THE CURRENT LICENSING RULES ARE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PROTECTIONIST AND NOT BASED ON ACTUAL COMPETENCY TO PERFORM THE DUTIES OF THE ONE OF THE WORK. ON THE CONFUSING PATCHWORK OF RULES ALONG WITH THE TIME AND COST OF OBTAINING A LICENSE WITH EACH MOVE OFTEN RESULTS IN A MILITARY SPOUSE SETTLING FOR UNLICENSED EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE OF THEIR EDUCATION AND SKILLS SIDE OR OPTING OUT OF THE WORK FORCE ENTIRELY. THIS CREATES FINANCIAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS AND INFLUENCES A FAMILY'S DECISION A IN THE MILITARY FACTORS THAT HER OUR MILITARY'S READINESS RETENTION AND RECRUITING. A SPOUSE'S ABILITY TO BUILD A MEANINGFUL CAREER IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE VETERANS ABILITY CHAIRED TRANSITION FROM ACTIVE DUTY TO CIVILIAN LIFE THIS IS WHY WE FOUNDED MISSION LICENSE AND WE HELP MILITARY SPOUSES NAVIGATE THESE ISSUES. OF THE TWO TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LICENSE TO WORK STUDY WHICH I INCLUDED A LINK TO FROM THE INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA LICENSES SIXTY TWO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME. OCCUPATIONS THE THIRD MOST IN THE COUNTRY ARIZONA AND CALIFORNIA WERE NAMED AS THE MOST WIDELY AN OWNER SLEE LICENSE STATES EARLIER THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW FOLKS ARE AWARE BUT- TO BE BOLD ACTION. THE FIRST STATE TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING ERRORS ON HIS LICENSING BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSES GRANTED IN OTHER STATES. SO WITH ALL OF THAT MIND UP FOR THREE COMMENDED TENS OUR STATE IS THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC AND- BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SECTION SIXTY SIX. REGULATE THE ADMISSION RETURN TO PRACTICE LAW IN CALIFORNIA AS DISCUSSED CALIFORNIA APPROVED RULE NINE POINT FOUR ONE POINT ONE EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND WELL WE ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THAT PROGRESS THE NEW RULE IS INCREDIBLY PROBLEMATIC THE BURDENSOME SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT UNNECESSARILY STIGMATIZES MILITARY SPOUSES BY TREATING THEM AS NO MORE THAN INTERNS REGARDLESS OF THE YEARS IN PRACTICE. A MILITARY SPOUSE pWITH NO TIES TO THE TO THE AREA MUST FIND AN EMPLOYER WILLING TO SIGN A DECLARATION COMMITTING TO ASSUME PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEM THE EMPLOYER MUST APPROVE EACH AND EVERY QUARTER OR DEPOSITION APPEARANCE IN WRITING. AND READ AND APPROVE ALL PLEADINGS AND IN FACT ANY DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED TO A THIRD PARTY WHICH I READ TO INCLUDE EVEN AN EMAIL. TO A THIRD PARTY HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THAT SUPERVISING ATTORNEY. IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ANOTHER STATE SERVER SENATOR ROSS TO YOUR POINT ON THE TIME IN PRACTICE ISSUES I THINK THE QUESTION IS. WILL THE TIME SPENT PRACTICING UNDER THIS REGISTERED MILITARY SPOUSE RULE IN CALIFORNIA ALLOW A SPOUSE TO THAN WE'VE INTO ANOTHER STATE LIKE TEXAS THAT REQUIRES FIVE OUT OF SEVEN. OR WHATEVER THEIR YEAR IN PRACTICE TIME IN PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS ARE. IT BASED ON THE RESTRICTIONS OF THIS RULE THE OTHER PROBLEM IS ALSO LOGISTICS THE RULE STIGMATIZES SPOUSES BY FORCING THEM TO JOB HUNT WITHOUT THE LICENSE IN HAND TO BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET THE LICENSE UNTIL THEY FIND. THE ATTORNEY TO SUPERVISE THEM MEANING A MILITARY SPOUSE IS LIKELY TO BE PASSED OVER BY EMPLOYERS FOR SOMEBODY WHO ALREADY HAS A LICENSE IN HAND. THESE CONCERNS WERE CONVEYED TO THE STATE BAR DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD LAST YEAR DESPITE RECEIVING THIRTY SEVEN COMMONS OPPOSING THE RULE OR PROPOSING AN ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS MENTORSHIP. I'M AN ONLY EIGHT COMMENTS IN FAVOR OF THE RULE NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES WERE MADE PRIOR TO ITS ADOPTION. I HEARD THE NUMBERS EARLIER IT SOUNDS LIKE THREE SPOUSES HAVE APPLIED AND WE RECOGNIZE I THINK IT'S ONLY BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE MARCH FIRST BUT- THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. MILITARY SPOUSE JEANETTE WHAT NETWORK MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL ANECDOTALLY HEARING FROM OUR MEMBERS WE KNOW THAT SOME EVEN WITH EMPLOYERS WHO ALREADY HAVE THEM WORKING AS A CLERK ROLE HAVE SAID. WE ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE ON THE BURDENS OF THIS RULE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SIT FOR THE BAR EXAM AND OTHERS ARE CONCERNED WITH THE TIME IN PRACTICE IN BEING ABLE TO WEAVE INTO THE NEXT STATE. SO THEY ARE OPTING. TO SIT FOR THE BAR EXAM RATHER THAN UTILIZING THIS ROLE. PRESIDENT WE BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATIVE ACTION IS NECESSARY TO OBTAIN A MORE PRACTICAL RULE. AS REFERENCED EARLIER MSG AND HAS IT ADOPTED OR HAS DEVELOPED A MODEL RULE FOR THE ADMISSION OF MILITARY SPOUSES THAT PROVIDES THE PUBLIC SAFETY PROTECTIONS WITHOUT UNNECESSARILY STIGMATIZING MILITARY SPOUSES SEEKING TO PRACTICE THE LAW. ON SOME OF THE THIRTY EIGHT JURISDICTIONS AND I WANTED TO CARESS I THINK THE NUMBER REFERENCE WAS THERE WERE ELEVEN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE SOME KIND OF SUPERVISION REQUIREMENT I BELIEVE IT'S NINE AND TWO OF THOSE ARE BASED ON. TIME AND PRACTICE SO YOU'RE ONLY SUPERVISED IF YOU'RE UNDER FIVE YEARS OR UNDER TWO YEARS IN PRACTICE WHERE IS CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF TIME. A YEARS YOU'RE REQUIRED TO BE SUPERVISED SO THE LAST TWO SUGGESTIONS ALL MAKE WHICH I THINK HAVE ALREADY BEEN BEEN COVERED IN PART ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD UPON THE FOUNDATIONS THAT ALREADY. EXISTS AND ADOPTING THE TWO THOUSAND SO OUTSIDE OF ATTORNEY LICENSING NOW I'M TALKING GENERAL MILITARY SPOUSE LICENSING. IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ADOPTING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA MILITARY SPOUSE LICENSOR LICENSURE STUDY. TO STAY THE OCCUPATIONAL BOARD SHALL ALLOW LICENSURE. AND SO REMOVING UNCERTAINTY AND ADOPTING A COMPREHENSIVE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND THEN FINALLY AS WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE LAST PANEL ON. REQUIRING REPORTING THINK OF SKIPS A LOT OF THIS BUT- I WAS RECOMMENDED RECOMMENDED BY THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA STUDY TRAINING AND REPORTING SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED REQUIRING REPORTING ON THE NUMBER OF MILITARY SPOUSES BEING PROCESSED THROUGH THE SYSTEM PROVIDES ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. I'LL CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT THE ONLY CERTAINTY OF MILITARY LIFE IS UNCERTAINTY. A MILITARY SPOUSES DO NOT DECIDE WHERE WE LIVE OR FOR HOW LONG OUR SERVICE MEMBERS CANNOT TURN DOWN A TRANSFER OR QUIT THEIR JOBS IF THE MOVE ISN'T IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR FAMILIES. AS MILITARY SPOUSES WE TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN THEIR SERVICE AND IN OUR ROLES AS MILITARY SPOUSES WE DON'T SPEAK SPECIALIST THE SPECIAL TREATMENT BUT WE DO ASK FOR COMMONSENSE RULES TO BE PUT IN PLACE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. EVERY BARRIER REDUCE CONTRIBUTES TO OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE BY MAKING LIFE A LITTLE EASIER FOR MILITARY FAMILIES INCLUDING THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN NEED OF A SECOND INCOME TO MAKE ENDS MEET. I ASK THAT YOU GIVE THESE. THREE CHANGES YOUR SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO HELP MILITARY SPOUSES BUILDING MEANINGFUL CAREERS AND SUPPORT THE RETENTION OF FAMILIES IN THE SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CRITICS REMAIN HERE FROM MISTRUST LOOK WHO'S. TO THE RESPECT OF A SOCIAL WORKER CAUCUSES WERE. SENATOR ALLEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIENCE THAT IS INSURED BY MANY OTHER MILITARY DEPENDENTS WITH PROFESSIONAL LICENSES MY NAME IS SONYA TRAFFIC AND I'M A PROUD AIR FORCE SPOUSE. OF A HUSBAND WHO IS CURRENTLY DEPLOYED OVERSEAS. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHEN MY HUSBAND FIRST JOINED THE AIRFORCE I HAD COMPLETED MY GRADUATE STUDIES IN SOCIAL WORK THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND LOS ANGELES. AFTER OBTAINING MY MASTER'S DEGREE MY HUSBAND WAS STATIONED AT LACKLAND AIR FORCE BASE TEXAS AND STAYED FOR SEVERAL YEARS. FORTUNATELY FOR ME I WAS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO OBTAIN BOTH MY LICENSE AS A MASTER LEVEL SOCIAL WORKER AND THE CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK LICENSE. TO DO SO I COMPLETED THE REQUIRED THREE THOUSAND SUPERVISION HOURS ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE THE ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS BOARDS EXAMINATION. I PRACTICE IN SAN ANTONIO AS AN ELEMENT STILL VERY ELEMENTS W. FOR FOUR YEARS BEFORE OBTAINING MY CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK LICENSE IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THAT SAME MONTH WE RECEIVED ORDERS TO BEALE AIR FORCE BASE CALIFORNIA. WITH THIS MOVE CAME EXCITEMENT ANTICIPATION. WHEN BUT WHEN I BEGAN LOOKING INTO THE SOCIAL WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA IT BECAME DISCOURAGING. THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE OVERWHELMING ESPECIALLY WITH THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING I HAD JUST RECEIVED I WAS FURTHER DISAPPOINTED WHEN I SAW THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS COULD BE EXPEDITED THERE WAS NO ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SUCH TIME FRAME AND NO GUARANTEE ON THE BOARDS PART. DESPITE MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION FROM THE STATE CALIFORNIA REQUIRED THAT I COMPLETE AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF REQUIREMENTS DURING WHICH I WAS OPERATING AS A SINGLE PARENT OF THREE. DURING MY SPICES ABSENCE FOR TRAINING AND PAGES UPON PAGES OF TEDIOUS COMPLICATED PAPERWORK. BUT BECAUSE MY FAMILY RELIES ON MY ADDITIONAL INCOME I BEGAN THE PROCESS IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS MY SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE AS ONE OF THE ONLY BI LINGUAL PROVIDERS IN THE AREA OR SIDE OUT BY FACILITIES IN NEED HOWEVER MY LACK OF LICENSE MEANT THAT I COULD NOT ACCEPT. THE SIX FIGURE SALARY OFFERS. AFTER NINE MONTHS AND OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS AN OUT OF POCKET COST. ON APRIL TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I FINALLY OBTAINED MY CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T ALSO MENTIONED THAT MY TRUE COST FAR EXCEED ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT THAT DOESN'T CAUGHT WHAT THAT COST DOESN'T TELL YOU IS THAT THE PREVIOUS SALARY THAT MADE ME THE PRIMARY EARNER. WHO IS NO LONGER FLOWING INTO OUR HOME. BUT THEIR CLASSES AND TELL YOU THAT A DEPLETED OUR SAVINGS AND MY RETIREMENT FUNDS TO ENSURE A FAMILY'S NEEDS WERE MET. SINCE RECEIVING MY LICENSE I DECIDED TO OPEN MY PRIVATE PRACTICE. BECOME A PROVIDER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S VICTIMS OF CRIME PROGRAM. I HELP CHILDREN AND ADULTS OVERCOME AND HE'LL FROM THEIR TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES BY UTILIZING EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES. AND MY CLINICAL BACKGROUND. I BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT I DO IN YOUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE FOR MONTHS THIS PROCESS HAS HINDERED ME. AND MANY LIKE ME. FROM ADDING VALUE INTO THE COMMUNITIES WE CALL OUR HOME EVEN ONLY FOR A FEW YEARS. MY STORYIS NOT UNIQUE MILITARY SPOUSES COME FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF BACKGROUNDS ETHNICITIES CULTURES EDUCATION AND SPECIALTIES. MANY OF US STRUGGLE TO FIND A CAREER OF OUR OWN AMONGST THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND CHALLENGES OF BEING A MILITARY SPOUSE. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM BUT I HAVE COME HERE TODAY. TO ADVOCATE FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. I DO THIS IN HOPES THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER AND DEVELOP A PROGRAM OR STREAMLINED THE SYSTEM. WELL CLOSING THE GAPS TO HELP OTHERS WHO WILL BE IN MY SHOES OVER THE YEARS. THE CHANGE YOU MAKE TODAY WILL LESSEN THE LOAD ON THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY GIVEN SO MUCH. MILITARY LIFE CAN BE DEMANDING BOTH FOR THE MILITARY MEMBER AND THEIR FAMILY. WE OPERATE OUR LIVES THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN AT ANY MOMENT FOR THE NEEDS OF THE MILITARY AND OUR NATION. IT IS A RESPONSIBILITY WE TAKE UPON OURSELVES FREELY AND WITH GRATITUDE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO FOR OUR LOVE OF COUNTRY AN HONOR TO THOSE BEFORE US. I HOPE THE LEADERS IN THIS ROOM. AND IN OUR NATION CAN FIND WAYS TO FOSTER MUTUALLY AND BENEFICIAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN STATE REGULATORY BOARDS IN AN EFFORT TO LESSEN THE CONSTRAINTS WE FEEL AND PRACTICING ARE CHOSEN PROFESSIONAL AND SERVING OUR BASE COMMUNITIES. ALL WE ASK IS AN EASIER PATH TO PURSUE OUR OWN CAREER GOALS WELL OUR SPOUSES SIR ALL WE ASK IS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADD VALUE INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WILL LIVE IN FOR THE COMING YEARS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. YOU. MISTRUST. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING TODAY I. CAME HERE TODAY BECAUSE I LAUNCH THE MILITARY'S FALLS PROFESSIONAL NETWORK AT TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE WHICH HAS GROWN TO FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR NOW. I'M A MILITARY SPOUSE MYSELF HAPPILY MARRIED TO MY PARTNER IN LIFE WE HAVE TWO WONDERFUL KIDS BUT WE HAVE MOVED FOUR TIMES IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. DURING THAT TIME I'VE BEEN EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR UNDEREMPLOYED. I'M HERE BECAUSE I LOVE WHAT MY HUSBAND DOES HOWEVER I'VE SEEN THAT THE PATHS FOR PROFESSIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME HAVE BEEN ERASED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WITH EVERY. MOVE THIS IS A TOPIC THAT. RELATES TO RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND RESILIENCE I MUCH MORE RESILIENT WHEN I WORK A GIVES ME A CHANCE TO FOCUS ON MY OWN PROFESSIONAL GOALS IT IS DRAINING AND DEPRESSING TO WAIT FOR YOUR SPOUSE TO COME BACK FROM FROM A DEPLOYMENT. AND. MOST OF ALL A SECOND INCOME GIVES US MUCH GREATER FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ABILITY TO PLAN FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO A LOT MORE FROM MILITARY SPOUSES SEEKING MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT. OR LAST SIX YEARS WE'VE LIVED IN FOUR DIFFERENT STATES BEFORE GETTING MARRIED I WORKED INTERNATIONALLY IN P. ARMENIAN EVENT MANAGEMENT WHEN WE- MET IN FLORIDA IT WAS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER HOWEVER I WAS NOT ABLE TO TEACH IN DC NEW JERSEY OR CALIFORNIA. WE MOVED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS IN THE PROCESS AND COST INVOLVED WOULD BE TO MUCH FOR ME TO TAKE ON. AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF IN CALIFORNIA FINALLY GOT A JOB AS AN OPERATIONS MANAGER BEFORE THAT I WAS A STAY AT HOME MOM. DEFINITELY THE HARDEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD WAS TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOM. AND I NOW HAD TO QUIT LAST MONTH BECAUSE WE HAVE MOVED YET AGAIN AND I'M CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED. BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE I WANTED TO HELP OTHER SPOUSES GET TO A MEANINGFUL JOB FASTER WHICH IS WHY I STARTED UP THE MSDN CHAPTER AT TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE. A SHORT STORY ABOUT WHO WE ARE WE MET IN AUGUST LAST YEAR THAT'S EXACTLY TWELVE MONTHS AGO. WE ORGANIZE OUR FIRST MEETING IN JUST UNDER TWO WEEKS AND A CREW TO NOW FOUR HUNDRED MEMBERS. IT DID NOT TAKE LONG FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT I WAS NOT ALONE. AT THIS FIRST MEETING TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE SHOWED UP ASKING THE VERY SAME QUESTION HOW CAN WE DO THIS MILITARY LIFESTYLE BETTER. WE BECAME AN OFFICIAL HIRING OUR HEROES AND THIS PAEAN CHAPTER IN SEPTEMBER LAST YEAR SO JUST A MONTH LATER. AND WE ORGANIZE WE CONTINUE TO ORGANIZE MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH AT LEAST ONE EMPLOYER PRESENT AND TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY FIVE SPOUSES WHO COME BACK EVERY MONTH ASKING WHAT. MEANING FULL JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE ARE OUT THERE FOR ME. WE REPRESENT THE DIVERSITY OF THE MILITARY SPOUSE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF AGE ETHNICITY PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND AND EDUCATION. AND THE COLEY TEAM ALONE INCLUDES A PHD CANCER SCIENTIST. THREE COUNSELORS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS BEHAVIOR THERAPIST POST PARTUM ARE AND TEACHERS IT CONSULTANTS A STAND UP COMEDIAN BANK TELLERS. SEVERAL STATE HOME MOMS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. AS WE'VE ALL HEARD MILITARY SPOUSES ARE VERY TALENTED THEY POSSESS MORE EDUCATION CREDITS THE MOST WORKING AMERICANS YES UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG MILITARY SPOUSES IS FOUR TIMES HIGHER. THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ESTIMATED BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TRAVIS MEMBERS. ABOUT A QUARTER THEM STRUGGLE WITH HER TO BEGIN A CERTIFICATION OR LICENSURE WHEN ARRIVING IN CALIFORNIA THE TOP OBSTACLES ARE VERY SIMPLE COST TIME AND PROCESS. THIS IS A TOPIC THAT IS BUZZING IN THE MILITARY SPOUSE COMMUNITY AS WE WANT TO PUT OUR EDUCATION TO USE AND EARN AN INCOME. I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU AN EXAMPLE OF DANIEL SHE'S IN OUR IN. SHE'S BEEN MARRIED TO MIKE NOW FOR TWO YEARS THIS WAS DONE A YEAR AGO THE SLIDE. AND THE CALIFORNIA WAS OUR FIRST DUTY STATION WHERE THERE ARE MOVING FROM WASHINGTON STATE. THEY GOT THEIR ORDERS IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT IT WOULD TAKE EIGHT MONTHS FOR. DANIEL TO GET A JOB AS AN RN. EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE SHE COULD START WORKING. AN EARNINGS AS THAT MUCH NEEDED SECOND INCOME. IT WAS IT TOOK TH TILL OCTOBER OR HER TO EVEN BE ABLE TO START APPLYING BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T START APPLYING FOR JOBS UNTIL SHE GOT HER LICENSE. I AND SHE WAS FRUSTRATED WITH MULTIPLE CLERICAL ERRORS ALONG THE WAY I AND SHE RECOMMENDS THAT WHAT CAN BE DONE IS ENSURING THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS ONLINE OR COMPLETE ENSURING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ASSOCIATES ARE WELL TRAINED. FOR THE MILITARY SPOUSE PROCESS AND CAN PROVIDE CORRECT INFORMATION ALLOWING THE APPLICATION DOCUMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED ONLINE INSTEAD OF HAVING TO WAIT TO BE DELIVERED. I AND TO HAVE A NATIONALLY ACCEPTED ARE IN LICENSE EVEN TEMPORARY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN START APPLYING FOR JOBS BEFORE. ARRIVING THE MOMENT THEY GET THEIR ORDERS. WHY A PASSION FOR MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT AS MILITARY SPOUSES WE START FROM SCRATCH EVERY TIME WE MOVE GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND EMPLOYMENT FASTER AND EASIER WILL GREATLY IMPACT RETENTION RECRUITMENT AND THE RESILIENCE OF. THIS RECIPROCITY. CITY PAVES THE PATHS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MILITARY SPOUSES AND GIVES US A CHANCE TO BUILD A MUCH BETTER AND BRIGHTER FUTURE AS MILITARY FAMILIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KEEPING THE CONVERSATION GOING. THANK YOU FOR SHOULD SEND ARRIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF WELL FIRST OF THE LAWYER PIECE I OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS ON THE SUPERVISION RULES WHICH IS WHY S. THE PER PANEL THE QUESTIONS I DID I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE I WOULD CERTAINLY AS THAT OF DID YOU KEEP IN CONTACT WITH ME AND THAT I WOULD ASK THE BAR ASSOCIATION TO TOOK TAKE A LOOK AT. THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY HAVE FOR SPECIFIC SUPERVISION BECAUSE SOME OF WHAT YOU MENTIONED TO ME. CERTAINLY AT SOME POINT GOES BEYOND WHAT AS A MANAGING PARTNER OF A LAW FIRM OR AS A PARTNER IN A LAW FIRM I EVEN DID WITH RESPECT TO. ASSOCIATES WITH SOME EXPERIENCE SO WE'LL NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AS TO THE WAIVER IN AND OF RULES AND OTHER STATES WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THE MOST WE CAN DO IN CALIFORNIA IS SAY THE TIME SPENT. PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA IS A REGISTERED SPOUSE ATTORNEY. COUNTS AS TIME SPENT PRACTICING AS AN ATTORNEY FOR ALL PURPOSES HERE. BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE RESUMES A FEW WERE TO MOVE TO SAN ANTONIO TEXAS IS GOING TO HAVE TO. IN A PART OF ITS ON THE OTHER STATE TO WRITE BUT WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THAT AND LASTLY. WHAT IMPACT IS THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS HAVE BOND ON THE ISSUE OF SUPERVISION. OF A NON LICENSED ATTORNEY PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA AND DOES THAT PLAY ANY PART IN THE WAY THE. THE BAR WILL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TO SEE WHETHER IT PLAYS ANY PART IN THE WAY THE BARS OF CO THE STATE BAR. OF DESIGNS THE SUPERVISION RULES BUT I COMMIT TO WORK ON THAT WITH YOU BECAUSE I DO THINK WE NEED TO MAKE TO SAY. USER FRIENDLY PROGRAM AND WE NEED TO HOLD OF MY POINT STARTING IN. JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE MILITARY SPOUSE LAWYERS. WHO CAME TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH A DEGREE AND A LICENSE IN THE STATE AND IN GOOD STANDING. COULD STEP OUT AND WORK IN THE STATE WELL A LOT OF INTERRUPTION AND WITH A LOT OF INTERFERENCE. FOR WHATEVER PERIOD OF TIME FRANKLY FIVE I AM PLEASED WITH FIVE YEARS. OF THE STATE BAR WAS WILLING TO PUT UP WITH. TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THIS THE SPOUSE FAMILY WAS GONNA THAN MOVE OR STAY IN THE STATE WHICH POINT YOU TAKE THE BAR EXAM BUT I'M COMMITTED TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SEE IF WE CAN STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT. I SAY ONE THING ON THAT QUICKLY I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT THE MALPRACTICE. THAT IS NOT COME UP. AS AN ISSUE WITH OUR MEMBERS AT LEAST SO. AND I'LL STAY IN THE THIRTY EIGHT STATES THAT NOW HAVE THESE RULES THERE'S NOT A SINGLE INCIDENT THAT I'M AWARE OF ANY MISCONDUCT. I'M NOT SURE ISSUES I'M NOT TOO GREAT WRITER WOULD COMMIT MALPRACTICE BUT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE INSURANCE. RIGHT WHAT ANOTHER IN THE AND THE QUESTION IS CAN YOU GET IT AND HOW DO YOU GET IT AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS. RIGHT THE MENTOR SUPERVISOR WHATEVER WE CALL HIM OR HER. IN THE ARMS OF SECURING THAT SO WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND AS TO THE OTHER OCCUPATIONS WHAT WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST. WE DO. TO SPEED THIS PROCESS WAS JOHNSON YOU'VE CERTAINLY HAD YOUR SHARE AND MA'AM. I WAS MOVED BY YOUR TESTIMONY WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE THIS WORK. I THOUGHT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SLIDE WITH RESPECT TO THE REGISTERED NURSE THE NURSE NURSES TAKEN NATIONAL EXAM OF THE- IN EXTRA NEXT TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THEY TAKE COMING OUT OF A NURSING SCHOOL. IN ORDER TO GET THEIR LICENSE AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE SO MUCH OF A RIGMAROLE. GETTING THAT PARTICULAR PERSON IN THE CALIFORNIA AND IN A POSITION I'M NOT SURE ABOUT PLACES CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS MAN MAYBE YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT. RIGHT SO RECENTLY IN THE PAST I BELIEVE TWO YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS ADOPTED THE NATIONAL EXAM HOWEVER. IF WE ARE GONNA OBTAIN OUR LICENSING CALIFORNIA WE DO NEED TO PROVIDE A LINE ETHICS EXAM WHICH SOME MIGHT ARGUE IS AS EQUALLY AS CHALLENGING AS THE BOARD EXAM AND IN MY CASE FOR EXAMPLE I PLAY I AM. YOU KNOW FAILING IS NOT AN OPTION IT'S WE ARE ON A TIME CRUNCH HERE AND SO I HAD TO PAY FOR COURSE. TO PASS THIS EXAM BECAUSE IT IS PRETTY RIGOROUS ACCORDING TO THE FEEDBACK PROVIDED BY OTHER LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER SEVERITY OF THAT TAKING THE EXAM. SO WHILE THERE IS A NATIONALLY EXAM. ACROSS THE NATION CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR OWN STIPULATIONS AND THEIR OWN SET OF REQUIREMENTS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO ABIDE AND THERE IS. THERE IS NO CONSIDERATION TAKEN FOR MILITARY SPOUSES EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT WILL BE EXPEDITED AND EVEN IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WHAT'S AMAZING TO A LAW AND ETHICS EXAM VERY IMPORTANT I SUPPOSE WE NEED PEOPLE TO. UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE AND CERTAINLY TO BE ETHICAL BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY WE CAN'T MOVE PEOPLE INTO A POSITION AND ALLOW WORK TO BE PERFORMED MUCH IS WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO DO HOWEVER IMPERFECT ARE PERFECT MAY BE WITH RESPECT TO LAWYERS. WHY WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT FOR LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS AS THE REST OF THIS PROCESS CATCHES UP AND IF YOU WANT TO PUT SOME MENTORSHIP REQUIREMENTS ON IT A NURSE CERTAINLY ALMOST ALWAYS NOT ALWAYS BUT ALMOST ALWAYS FUNCTIONS IN A GROUP. SETTING OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PERHAPS NOT SO MUCH WITH LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKERS BUT YOU COULD CERTAINLY HAVE THAT HAPPEN AS WE MOVE MILITARY SPOUSES INTO THESE POSITIONS AND ALLOW THE SUPPLEMENTAL TESTING IN. AND ALL THAT TO CATCH UP WILL HAVE TO WORK ON THAT. AND I GUESS YEARS IS A TEACHING SITUATION MA'AM I'M BAFFLED BY THE FACT THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS A FRENCH TEACHER. WE COULDN'T PUT TO WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'LL HAVE TO GET ON THAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER. JUST A CLEVERNESS THIS TRAVEL DID YOU ACTUALLY YOU GOT A JOB ON THE BASE AS A SOCIAL WORKER NO I HAVE A PRIVATE PRACTICE IN THE CITY OF ROSEVILLE OKAY SACRAMENTO YEAH I WAS OFFERED A COUPLE JOBS ON BASE. AT THE TIME I WAS A SINGLE MOM THREE THAT CHILD CARE IS AN ISSUE BEALE AIR FORCE BASES A VERY RURAL COMMUNITY THE ACCESSIBILITY TO JOBS AND TRANSPORTATION AND CHILD CARE IS VERY LIMITED THERE. AND SO FOR ME MY OPTION CONSIDERING I'M A MILITARY SPOUSE MY HUSBAND'S JOB IS ALWAYS. FOR EXAMPLE HE'S DEPLOYED. I NEEDED TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN MY JOB AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WAS ABLE TO BE OFFERED IN AND JUSTICE FOR FOLKS THE VIEW ON HOW HOW. COMMON OR UNCOMMON IS IT FOR THERE TO BE SUCH A GIVEN THE FACT THE OF SO MANY FAMILIES MILITARY FAMILIES LIVING ON AROUND BASIS. WHAT IS THE CHILD CARE SITUATION TYPICAL TYPICALLY ON THESE BASIS SO WE MET YESTERDAY WITH THE MILITARY SPOUSE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT ZONE IN SAN DIEGO AND HAD SEVERAL FOLKS DISCUSSING THE SITUATION THERE WHICH IS THERE ARE TEARS. THE BASED WILL FIRST I THINK IT WAS TO ACTIVE DUTY MEMBERS WITH CHILDREN ALL HAVE PRIORITY THAN A SINGLE SERVICE MEMBER HAS PRIORITY AND RIGHT NOW THOSE ARE THE ONLY TWO TEARS GETTING INTO THE- CHILD CARE ON BASE IS A SINGLE MOM WHOSE. SPOUSES OVERSEAS IN THE COUNTRY BE RIGHT IN THE MIX OF FACT MAYBE EVEN HIGHER THAN THOSE ONES BECAUSE THIRDS HERE IS A SERVICE MEMBER WITH THE WORKING SPOUSE AND AT THAT AND AS OF YESTERDAY WE WERE TOLD THAT WAS NOT BUT THEY WERE NOT BEING ADMITTED TO THE ON BASE NOW THERE ARE OPTIONS TO GO OFF BASE AND SOME SUBSIDIES. WHICH IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE BUT CHILD CARE CERTAINLY COMES OF IT EVERY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT DISCUSSION WE GO TO. SEE TO ME THAT WOULD BE IT WAS OUR. WELL I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR DO YOU NEED TO TAKE ON. YEAH I KNOW AND I MEAN TO KEEP FLIPPING BACK TO YOU BUT YOU ARE YOU'RE COMING TO US ASKING FOR CHANGES WHICH I THINK ARE APPROPRIATE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THE DOD IS DOING WHAT NEEDS TO DO. AND SOMETIMES FORGETS THESE THINGS IT SEEMS. HIS MERE CHILD CARE IS A IT IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE BY. CHILD CARE CAN BE SOLVED WITH. WITH THE SALARY. AND IN IN MY CASE SEARCHING FOR A JOB. PUT ME OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE YOU CAN'T EFFECTIVELY SEARCH FOR A JOB AND GO TO INTERVIEWS WITHOUT PAYING FOR CHILDCARE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND THAT CHILD CHILD CARE. AND YOU END UP COMMITTING TO EITHER PAYING FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. AND LOSING THAT MONEY. FOR EVERY INTERVIEW THAT YOU GO ON ANYTIME THAT YOU WANT TO SEPARATE FOR THAT. THE JOB SEARCH AND BUT WHEN I FINALLY GOT A MEANINGFUL JOB WITH ENOUGH OF A SALARY THAT PAYS FOR MY CHILD CARE THAT'S- THAT SOLVES THAT THAT URBAN. IT'S A CHICKEN AND THE EGG SITUATION FOR SURE RIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T I GUESS MY POINT IS IF YOU'RE IN IN THIS TRAFFIC SITUATION YOU'VE GOT THREE KIDS YOUR YOUR SPOUSE'S OVERSEE SERVING THE COUNTRY. AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE A BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO HELP REGARDLESS OF. WHAT THE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY OR NOT IN A I MEAN THAT'S- THAT'S MY FEELING IS THE- FATHER OF A TEN MONTH OLD. I'M I'M JUST I MEAN IN GENERAL I'M APPALLED BY HOW LITTLE INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE IN GENERAL FOR CHILD CARE COMPARED TO COMPETITOR NATIONS AND IT'S JUST THE POINTS BEEN DRIVEN HOME WHEN MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT- YEAH WE PUT PEOPLE IMPOSSIBLE SITUATIONS AT A YOU JUST LIKE THAT CRAZY SITUATIONS YOU'RE ALL. YEAH RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT WITH REGARDS TO CALIFORNIA'S LICENSOR RULES THAT WE'RE GONNA TURN AGAIN ADDRESSED. AND SOME. IN A I JUST THINK IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR US TO BE KIND OF CONSIDERING BY THE WAY IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME FULL PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT I OR YOU KNOW WHATEVER EXISTING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT EXIST ON THE BASIS THAT WE COULD HELP TO ASSIST WITH BY THE WITH THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OR WITH THE PRIVATE SECTORS PROVIDERS OR AND OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR PROVIDERS WE GOT A LOOK INTO. THAT AS WELL. BECAUSE IN MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF FORM OF ANY SEE YOU KNOW EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. INFRASTRUCTURE AND. I DON'T KNOW HOW IF THERE'S ENOUGH CONVERSATION HAPPENING THERE BUT YEAH MISTER I JUST WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT NOT ALL OF THESE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS. ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE LOCATED IN URBAN AREAS LIKE I SAN DIEGO AND- IF YOU'RE AN EDWARDS AIR FORCE SPACER AND AT BEALE. YOU CAN YOU CONTROLLED GETTING FROM THE POPULATED AREA TO THE MAIN GATE LITERAL RIGHT. AND SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO IF THE IF THE MILITARY CHILD CARE FACILITY IS. OVERSUBSCRIBED THE OPPORTUNITY TO CSUS SECURE ALTERNATIVE CHILD CARE I WOULD IMAGINE. A CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT ALL THE MORE REASON WHY WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER FACILITIES ON BASS AND LOGISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS SO I JUST. AND IF I CAN ADD ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO EMPLOY MILITARY SPOUSES SO THE EASIER WE CAN MAKE IT FOR SPOUSES TO BECOME CERTIFIED TO BE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER. IN CALIFORNIA KIND OF HIS SOLVING TO PROBLEMS WITH. I'M AND MAYBE IF THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW. I MAY MEET ME IN A MAY MAYBE IF THE ON BASE. I REMEMBER IF IT'S ON BASE THERE IN A BECAUSE IT'S NOT YOU KNOW FEDERAL FACILITY THERE THAT ALSO CAN BE SOME SORT OF STREAMLINING I DON'T KNOW. BUT THAT'S ANOTHER THING FOR US TO SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT. THANK YOU GUYS THANK YOU SO MUCH HE REALLY DID A GOOD JOB OF I THINK HIGHLIGHTING THE HUMAN STORIES BEHIND THE- POLICY CHALLENGES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE FIRST PANEL. OKAY LET'S NOW HEAR FROM SOME OF OUR FRIENDS WHO ARE ACTUALLY. IN VARIOUS HAVE BEEN OR ARE IN VARIOUS LEVELS OF LEADERSHIP OF THE MILITARY OR DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS WE HAVE JOHN TEMAS HIS DEPUTY TO THE GARRISON COMMANDER. IT'S COMING OUT OF FOR WHEN I BELIEVE RIGHT WITH THE US ARMY I WE'VE GOT VICE ADMIRAL. AND JUST RETIRED I SUPPOSE FROM FROM. FROM THE US COAST GUARD AND ABBAS ALSO SERVING AS VICE CHAIR THE GOVERNOR'S MILITARY COUNCIL WITHIN OUR JULY THAN OTHERS. AND ROBERT HERRERA WHO'S THAT WHO'S WITH OUR CALVET. PROGRAM WORKING WITH MY GOOD FRIEND DR IF I SEE ANY. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO YOUR PERSPECTIVES AS WELL IT'S ALSO ON THE MILITARY COUNCIL YES THAT'S RIGHT. YES YOU MAY YOU MAY YOU MAY PROCEED. CAROLINE BOB MEMBERS OF THE STAFF AND OF THE TRICK COMMITTING A GOOD AFTERNOON I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE TO THE US ARMY. BUT WE'VE YOU SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT AS A CRITICAL ASPECT OVERALL RETENTION EFFORTS. IT'S BEEN SAID THAT YOU RECRUIT A SOLDIER BUT YOU RETAIN A FAMILY. GIVEN THE CURRENT CHALLENGES WE ARE IN MANY THAT WE FACE OUR RETENTION IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES. MY NAME IS JOHN SIMMERS ON THE DEPUTY GARRISON COMMANDER FOR HER WHEN HOME OF THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER. AND I LIKE THE NAVY THE MARINE CORPS WHO MAINTAINS A REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS TO PRESENT ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES ARE THE ARMY DOES NOT SERVE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGEST ARMY INSTALLATION IN THE STATE. I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. FOR THOSE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER IS PREMIER TRAINING ACTIVITY IN UNITED STATES ARMY. IT IS THE LARGEST OF THE ARMY'S THREE COMBAT TRAINING CENTERS OR SEE TC'S. BUT THE MISSION OF THE CDC PROGRAM IS TO PROVIDE REALISTIC JOINT AND COMBINED ARMS COLLECTIVE TRAINING FOR SOLDIERS LEADER STASSEN UNITS. A IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARMY ENJOYING DOCTRINE AT THE NATIONAL TRAINING CENTER THE PROBE FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON TRAINING MECHANIZED BRIGADE COMBAT TEAMS OR BC TEASE. WE'RE THE ONLY MILITARY INSTALLATION IN THE WORLD WE'RE BRIGADE SIZED UNIT CAN TRAIN TOGETHER AT A AND IS AS A COMBINED UNIT. THE END YOU SEE TRAINING EXPERIENCE AS AN INTENSE PROGRAM IT'S NOMINALLY TWENTY FOUR DAYS IN LENGTH BUT ACTUALLY MUCH LONGER FOR THE UNIT. THAT HAS. ASIAN AT THE CONCLUSION OF TRAINING. NTC IS TYPICALLY THE LAST EVENT IN THE TRAINING PROGRESSION THAT PREPARES UNITS FOR OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENT WE ARE THOROUGHLY FOCUSED ON MAKING UNITS BETTER IN THE ANY MISTAKES MADE OR WEAKNESSES IDENTIFIED RE MEDIATED AT AND T. C. RATHER THAN DOWN RANGE WHERE IT COUNTS FOR REAL. AS I MENTIONED TRAINING IS REALISTIC AND INTENSE SENIOR ARMY LEADERSHIP GAVE DIRECTION SOMETIME AGO TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE UNIT HAS QUOTE. A LIP QUIVERING EXPERIENCE WALLET NTC. WHATEVER WHAT BCT ARRIVES FOR TRAINING GOOD THING OR BAD THING. THAT'S A GOOD THING SIR. WHEN A BCT ARRIVES FOR TRAINING IT BRINGS FIVE THOUSAND TO SIX THOUSAND SOLDIERS AN APPROXIMATE TWO THOUSAND VEHICLES OUT TO T. AS YOU MAY EXPECT IN ORDER TO TRAINING UNIT OF THAT SIZE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LAND IS REQUIRED. FOR URBAN LOCATING THE HIGH MOJAVE DESERT SAND BURNED YOU KNOW COUNTY HAS AT LAND AVAILABLE. WE SAT ON OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES SURPRISE ME TWELVE HUNDRED SQUARE MILES. FOR PERSPECTIVE OUR TRAINING AREA IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME SIZE AS THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND. THIS ENVIRONMENT PROVIDES AN OPTIMAL TRAINING EXPERIENCE ARE REMOTENESS AMPLIFIES THE DIFFICULTIES ARMY FAMILIES EXPERIENCE. DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR FREQUENT LOCATIONS A MOVE TO FORT URBAN ADDS COMPLEXITY TO THE SITUATION. THE NEAREST CITY IS BAR STYLE A SMALL AREA OF ONLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND RESIDENTS PROVIDING ONLY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FORT IRWIN IS RECOGNIZED IN ARMY REGULATIONS AS A QUOTE REMOTE AND ISOLATED BASE ONE OF ONLY A FEW IN THE CONTINENTAL U. S. TO CARRY THAT DESIGNATION. BECAUSE OF THIS THE FOR URBAN LEADERSHIP IS KEENLY AWARE THAT WE MUST PROVIDE A WELCOME EXPERIENCE FOR THE SOLDIER AND HIS OR HER FAMILY. THE BETTER INSULATION IS TRULY THEIR HOMETOWN COMMUNITY DURING THEIR TOUR. I SAY ALL THIS TO GIVE CONTEXT TO THE DISCUSSION IN NEXT TEMP TO FRAME THE CURRENT SITUATION FOR THE TYPICAL ARMY SPOUSE IN REGARDS TO EMPLOYMENT. ACCORDING TO THE US COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS THE TYPICAL MILITARY SPOUSE HAS MORE EDUCATION IN THE OVERALL CIVILIAN POPULATION. AROUND 40% HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE IN NEARLY CONTRASTS WITH THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 30% WITH THE DEGREE AND ONLY 55% WITH SOME COLLEGE. DESPITE THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION MILITARY SPOUSES ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE IN THE LABOR FORCE WHEN THE GENERAL WORKING AGE POPULATION. 57% AS COMPARED THOUSAND SIXTEEN SURVEY. GIVEN THAT LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION TYPICALLY INCREASES WITH THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION THE DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY GREATER THAN THOSE NUMBERS INDICATE. FOR THE MILITARY SPOUSE THAT SPOUSES THAT ARE IN THE LABOR FORCE THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE EXACT RATE IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE AS BEST MEN'S RANGE FROM A LOW OF ONLY 10% TO A HIGH OF 24% GIVEN THAT THE OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS CURRENTLY LESS THAN 4% THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT IS MUCH HIGHER FOR THE MILITARY SPOUSE COMMUNITY THEN FOR THE AVERAGE AMERICAN. THE REASONS BEHIND THESE NUMBERS ARE MARRIED. MANY MILITARY SPOUSES CLAIM THEY CANNOT FIND RELIABLE CHILDCARE. HOWEVER IN MANY CASES THE REASON IS DUE TO THE POOR OUTLOOK FOR THE MILITARY SPOUSE LOOKING FOR EMPLOYMENT. MILITARY SPOUSES FACE TO FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING EMPLOYMENT. FREQUENT RELOCATION EVERY TWO TO THREE YEARS ON AVERAGE MEANS THAT THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE GAPS IN THEIR RESUMES ALONG WITH NUMEROUS JOBS HELD WE SHORT TENURES. IF NOT SCREENED OUT WITHOUT EVEN AN INTERVIEW SPOUSES ARE OFTEN ASK QUESTIONS SUCH AS- WHY HAVE YOU MOVED AROUND SO MUCH FOR WHEN WILL YOU MOVE AGAIN. CREATING CONSCIOUS OR NOT A BIAS AGAINST HIRING MILITARY SPOUSES. EMPLOYERS FIELD THE SPOUSE CAN MOVE AGAIN ON SHORT NOTICE AND THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT NOW. THE RESULT IS THAT IN ADDITION TO LOW LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. MORE THAN HALF OF THE MILITARY SPOUSES WHO ARE WORKING SAY THEY ARE IN A POSITION THAT THEY ARE OVER QUALIFIED FOR AND AS A RESULT THE TYPICAL MILITARY SPOUSE EARNS 26% LESS THAN THEIR NON MILITARY PEERS. A DIFFERENCE OF MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN INCOME LOSS TO THOSE MILITARY FAMILIES. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FATE ISSUE FACING MILITARY SPOUSES AS A SEEK EMPLOYMENT THAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR A MOMENT. OF THE MILITARY SPOUSES WHO DO WORK NEARLY 35% REQUIRE PROFESSIONAL LICENSE TO MAINTAIN THEIR STATUS IN ABILITY TO WORK IN THEIR CHOSEN CAREER FIELD. INCLUDING A PRICE WE 19% IN THE HEALTHCARE FIELD AND APPROXIMATELY 10% IN THE EDUCATION FIELD. SIGNIFICANTLY THOSE LIGHTS IS OFTEN DO NOT TRANSFER ACROSS STATE LINES. A MAJOR ISSUE CONSIDER THAT A MILITARY FAMILY IS APPROXIMATELY TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO MOVE ACROSS STATE LINES THAT ARE NON MILITARY FAMILY. I'LL GIVE A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF WHAT THIS USED TO MEAN. THERE'S A SPOUSE OF A SOLDIER CURRENTLY AT FORT OR IN WHO WORKS AS A SCHOOL TEACHER. UPON THAT FAMILIES INITIAL POTION TO BORDER ON SOME YEARS AGO. SHE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF OBTAINING A CALIFORNIA TEACHER CREDENTIAL A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES MULTIPLE TESTS OTHER REQUIREMENTS. SUBSEQUENTLY SHE LEFT THE STATE HER HUSBAND WAS POSTED TO DIFFERENT INSTALLATION. SHE WENT ABOUT A CHENEY TEACHER CREDENTIAL IN THAT STATE AND LET HER CALIFORNIA CREDENTIAL EXPIRE. AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT AFTER SOME OTHER TOWARDS A DUTY THE FAMILY RETURNED AFFORD OR WHEN. SINCE SHE A LETTER CREDENTIAL THAT SHE HAD TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS AGAIN. TAKING MULTIPLE TASKS AND SPENDING OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET RE CERTIFIED. CURRENTLY TO ENSURE TO SHE DOES NOT HAVE TO REPEAT THIS PROCESS EVER AGAIN SHE NOW MAINTAINS CURRENT TEACHING CREDENTIALS IN FOUR DIFFERENT STATES. JUST IN CASE HER HUSBAND'S CAREER TAKES HER TO ONE OF THOSE PLACES AGAIN. OF COURSE THIS WILL NOT HELP IF HE GETS AN ASSIGNMENT IN THE STATE WHERE THEY HAVE NOT LIVED BEFORE. FOR URBAN REMOTE INSTALLATION THERE ARE FOUR SCHOOLS ON BOARD THE BASS. NOTED THESE ARE NOT DIFFER PARTNER DIFFERENT SCHOOLS RATHER DISTRICT IN STATE SCHOOLS ARE SITUATED ON THE INSTALLATION. AT THE SCHOOLS ARE PRICE BY 25230% OF THE STAFF OR MILITARY SPOUSES. MOST OF WHOM REQUIRE CREDENTIAL SO YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT THESE PROGRAMS. WE DO RECOGNIZE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IN REGARDS TO SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS OF RETAINING CREDENTIAL. ESPECIALLY FOR TEACHERS BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PROFESSIONS. AS WELL WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS BEANIE TWO THOUSAND TEN NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY AND VETERANS AS WELL AS SPOUSES. INCLUDING VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOR TEACHER CREDENTIALING. HOWEVER WE RESPECTFULLY BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS CAN BE MADE. RECENTLY IN BOTH ARIZONA AND UTAH CHANGES WERE MADE TO ALLOW A MILITARY SPOUSE TO WORK IN THAT STATE. BASED ONLY UPON HAVING A LICENSE IN GOOD STANDING FROM ANY OTHER STATE. THIS IS A GOOD AND STATE THAT WOULD BE DESIRABLE CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THE OBSTACLES IT MAY PREVENT SHORT TERM IMPLEMENTATION. THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES MEASURES WE BELIEVE CAN BE ENACTED IN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE SHORT TERM. THESE INCLUDE. IN THESE HAVE BEEN TOUCHED ON BEFORE BUT I DO WANT TO REPEAT ABU FIRST JOINING THE INTERSTATE COMPACTS ON OCCUPATIONAL LICENSURE THAT ALREADY EXIST FOR MANY HEALTHCARE FIELDS. SECOND PROVIDING LICENSURE BY ENDORSEMENT FOR RECOGNITION FOR OUT OF STATE LICENSE ESPECIALLY AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE WHILE ALLOWING NEWLY ARRIVED FAMILY MEMBERS TO OBTAIN THE FULL REQUIRED CREDENTIALS. THE THIRD EXEMPTING MILITARY SPOUSES FOR THE REQUIREMENT FOR WHAT'S CALLED CONTINUOUS OR IMMEDIATELY PRIOR EXPERIENCE SINCE AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE MILITARY LIFESTYLE CAN MAKE THIS REQUIREMENT CHALLENGING. AND FINALLY OUR FOR A WAIVER OF LICENSURE FEES AN EXPEDITED EXPEDITED EDUCATION FOR ALL APPLICATIONS IN OUR CAREER FIELDS. ANY MOVEMENT ON THESE OR OTHER SIMILAR INITIATIVES THAT HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF OUR SOLDIERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND IN PARTICULAR A HELP TO ENABLE BETTER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MILITARY SPOUSES. WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK TODAY NUMBER HALF THE FORD OR COMMUNITY AND THE ARMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SURE. OKAY HOME NEXT YEAR WITH FROM BY FEDERAL BROKERAGE. GOOD AFTERNOON. ALLEN SENATOR ROTH COULD SEE YOU AGAIN SIR STAFF IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TODAY I RETIRED AFTER SERVING THIRTY FOUR YEARS ON ACTIVE DUTY IN THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD WHICH I WOULD NOTE IS AN ARM SERVICE BUT IT'S NOT PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IT IS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SO IT'S NOT ONLY MILITARY TIMES OF WAR REYES OR HAS THAT WORK THAT. THAT THERE IS A LAW THAT THAT PROVIDES FOR THAT I THINK SINCE SECURITY STOOD UP AND WITH THE IT'S A PROFILE OR PORTFOLIO OF RESPONSIBILITIES I DO NOT SEE THAT THE COAST GUARD WOULD EVER AGAIN MOVE UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. AND I CURRENTLY SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY COUNCIL I WOULD LIKE TO JUST TECHNOLOGY GROUP THAT IS HERE IN THE AUDIENCE ARE WHO ARE TERRIFIC PARTNERS WORKING ON A WHOLE ARRAY OF ISSUES WITH US ON THE COUNCIL IN IN THAT IT ARE THAT IS THAT WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE DEFENSE SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THOSE LEADERS WHO ARE FROM THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN PROXIMITY TO OUR BASES ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS IS A VERY VERY ACTIVE GROUP WHOSE PARTNERSHIP WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. I THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND FOR AFFORDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. IT IS AN ISSUE OF SUCH IMPORT TO THE MILITARY THAT THE SERVICE SECRETARIES JOINTLY SIGNED A LETTER. TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION IN FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOTING THIS IS ONE OF THEIR TOP TWO PRIORITIES. AND ONE WHICH WOULD IMPACT BASING AND RESOURCING DECISIONS AND IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD RECENTLY. THESE ISSUES HAVE BECOME PART OF THE SCORING CRITERIA FOR MISSIONS THAT WILL AFFECT RESOURCING. I'M HONORED TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY AND BRING SEVERAL DIFFERENT LENSES TO THIS ISSUE. AS THE DETAILER AND THEN HEAD OF MY SERVICES OFFICER ASSIGNMENTS SYSTEM MY EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND THE STRESS FRUSTRATION AND FAMILY IMPACT SPOUSAL CREDENTIALING CHALLENGES CREATED. AND PART OF MY RESPONSE TO OUR CHAIR GLAZIER WOULD HAVE BANNED WHEN WE LOOK AT THE IMPACT IT IMPACTS THE SERVICE'S ABILITY TO ASSIGN PEOPLE. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I RETURN ROUTINELY HEARD THAT PEOPLE LOVE WHO NEED LICENSING AND CREDENTIALING THE FAMILIES DID NOT WANT TO MOVE TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF ITS REPUTATION IN THIS ARENA. AS OPERATIONAL COMMANDER IN ONGOING MENTOR I EXPERIENCE CONTINUE TO SEE THEM DOWN AND WAITS A MILITARY MAN ABILITY TO FOCUS ON THEIR MISSION. ONCE HE LEFT THE SERVICE MY HUSBAND BECAME OF THAT MERION SO I LIVED THIS EXPERIENCE. AND LASTLY IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY COUNCIL I CONTINUE TO HEAR THE IMPACT ON SERVICE MEMBERS THEIR FAMILIES BASES BUSINESSES AND ALSO THE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S REPUTATION. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WHEN I FIRST BECAME A FLAG OFFICER I RECEIVED ORDERS TO CALIFORNIA. I HAD TO REPORT AND SHORT TERM WELL BEFORE THE END OF THE SCHOOL YEAR SO I MOVED AHEAD OF MY FAMILY. MY HUSBAND HAD TO MOVE OUR FAMILY. FIND TEMPORARY QUARTERS WHEN HE SHOWED UP AND WAS INFORMED HOUSING WASN'T READY GET OUR KIDS STARTED ON THEIR SPORTS TEAM WHICH IS THE VEHICLE WE USE FOR OUR CHILDREN TO INTEGRATE INTO NEW COMMUNITIES AND TO HAVE FRIENDS WHEN SCHOOL STARTED GET OUR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN SCHOOL-WERE NEEDED PROOF OF RESIDENCE. AND THEN GET OUR HOUSEHOLD GOODS DELIVERED AND SETTLED INTO OUR HOME. AT THIS TIME I WAS OVERSEAS AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING WELL MY HUSBAND DEALT WITH THIS. UP TO THIS POINT ALL OF THE MOVES TO MY SPOUSE'S THAN SEVENTEEN YEARS AS A VETERINARIAN AT BENCHES STATES WITH RECIPROCITY USUALLY REQUIRING TAKING A TEST ON THE STATE HEALTH LAWS. AND CALIFORNIA MY HUSBAND WAS REQUIRED TO FIND A CALIFORNIA LICENSE VETERINARIAN. VOLUNTEER FORTY HOURS TO THAT VETERINARIAN SO THAT HE COULD BE ASSESSED AND THEN SPONSORED FOR LICENSING HERE'S SOME REQUIRED TO TAKE A ONE WEEK COURSE THAT WAS OFFERED IN LOS ANGELES ONCE A YEAR. IN THE SPRING. MOST MILITARY FAMILIES MOVE OVER THE SUMMER. THAT WAS MY SPOUSE'S WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT HE DECIDED NOT TO PRACTICE WHICH WAS AN OPTION FOR US. ULTIMATELY AFTER VOLUNTEERING AT MARIN HUMANE SOCIETY HE DID GET HIS CALIFORNIA LICENSE AND STARTED WORK HE TAUGHT ADVANCED SURGICAL SKILLS TO THE STAFF AND ULTIMATELY DID HIMSELF OUT OF A JOB BY ESTABLISHING A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE SOCIETY AND THE DAVIS VETERINARY SCHOOL SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM. RESULTING IN THE HIGHER OF A GRADUATE OF THAT PROGRAM AND HE MOVED ON TO OTHER SHELTERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH. SERVICE JOBS NO I SHARE THIS EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH IT'S A LITTLE DATED FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS FIRST AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD MY HUSBAND'S EXPERIENCE IN OUR FAMILIES IS NOT UNIQUE. FORTUNATELY WHAT HE EXPERIENCED NOT BE THE EXPERIENCE FOR OF THAT MERION COMING TO CALIFORNIA TODAY THAT LICENSING BOARD HAS A VERY EASY TO USE WEBSITE WITH THE SPECIFIC BUTTON FOR MILITARY SPOUSES AND ONE FOR TRANSITIONING MILITARY AND ALSO OFFERS TEMPORARY LICENSES. SECOND THIS WAS MY HUSBAND'S WELCOME TO CALIFORNIA HIS FIRST IMPRESSION THAT IMPRESSION IS LASTING AS MILITARY MOVES AROUND AND IT IS AN IMPRESSION THAT IS ACTIVELY SHARED. FURTHER. EVERYONE ULTIMATELY LEAVES ACTIVE DUTY THE IMPRESSION IMPACTS DECISIONS TO SEAT POST SERVICE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. THIRD WE HAVE A SAYING IN THE MILITARY LEAVE A UNIT BETTER THAN YOU FOUND IT THAT IS WHAT MY SPELLS AND OTHER MILITARY SPOUSES DO THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE WITH THEM WE FLEX ON THE SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHER VETS AND SPOUSES. THEY BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE AND BROADEN NETWORKS THE QUITE FRANKLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIA. THE MILITARY COUNCILS FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS ISSUE WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WORKING WITH EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASES SENATOR RALPH MAY REMEMBER. WE BECAME AWARE OF TEACHER SHORTAGES IN THE SCHOOL SUPPORTING THE BASE AND THAT THERE WERE QUALIFIED TEACHERS AMONG THE MILITARY SPOUSES WHO COULD NOT GET CREDENTIALED IN THE STATE. THE STUDENT MAKES ALONG WITH OTHERS WE ENGAGED AND TODAY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BEEN MADE TO JOIN TEACHER CREDENTIALING PROCESS IS BE YOU HAVE HEARD MISMATCHES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION. THE NATIONAL SECURITY FOUR POINT IN OUR STATE IS LARGE RIVALING EVER CULTURE IN ITS ECONOMIC IMPACT AND LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA RANKED NUMBER ONE AND CONTRACTOR DOLLARS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. WORKFORCE IS KEY TO THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF THIS AND ANY STATE. WE HAVE HEARD FROM BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE OF THE CHALLENGES AND HIRING PREDOMINANTLY STEM WHICH AND WHICH INCLUDES LICENSED SPECIALISTS. AND THOSE WERE SECURITY CLEARANCES. OUR STATE FOOTPRINT AS YOU HAVE HEARD INCLUDES ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC ARRAY OF LABS TESTING DEVELOPMENT CENTERS RANGES AND DEPOSE OF ANY STATE. THE WORK FORCES OF THESE LOCALES ARE HIGHLY CIVILIAN EYES COMPRISED OF SCIENTISTS LAB OPERATORS ENGINEERS AND OTHERS. MOST ARE LOCATED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS THAT MANY CIVILIANS AS YOU REFER TO FOR HER WHEN ARE NOT DRAWN TO. THIS ALSO CHALLENGES THERE ARE THIS ALSO CAUSES CHALLENGES AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THESE COMMUNITIES. LICENSING AND CREDENTIALING PROCESSES TEND TO TAKE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH NOT RECOGNIZING THAT MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE SOMETIMES MORE ADVERSELY IMPACTED. MEASURES SUCH AS TEMPORARY LICENSES CREEK FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES. THIS IS NOT A ONE SIDED ISSUE THAT ONLY BENEFITS THE TRANSITIONING MILITARY AND SPOUSES IT IS GOOD BUSINESS AND HUMAN CAPITAL PRACTICE. ARE TRANSITIONING MILITARY AND SPOUSES BRING IN A RAY OF EXPERIENCE FROM NEW TO THE WORK FORCE TO DEEP EXPERIENCE EITHER TECHNICALLY OR ORGANIZATIONALLY AND COVER MANY PRISON PROFESSIONS AGAIN WHICH YOU HAVE HEARD. WE ARE MISSING OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO FULLY LEVERAGE THE TALENT AVAILABLE TO DRIVE OUR ECONOMY AND WE ARE CERTAINLY MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET THIS TALENT KNOW THAT WE WANT THEM TO REMAIN. RETURN OR TO SEEK SEEK OUT POST SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE ONLY GET ONE CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IN COMPETITION FOR TALENT AND THAT OTHER STATES HAS STEPPED OUT AGGRESSIVELY AND RESPONSIVE THE SERVICE SECRETARIES LETTERS. THOSE EFFORTS ARE NOTED IN THE PENTAGON AND COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS AND WITHIN THE SERVICE COMMUNITIES. THERE HAVE BEEN STEPS FORWARD THE CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY STILL HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING A DIFFICULT STATE FOR LICENSING AND CREDENTIALING. THE MILITARY COUNCIL DID ITS OWN ASSESSMENT LAST YEAR ON CREDENTIALING PORTABILITY AND IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES TODAY WE ARE INFORMED BY THE BEST PRACTICES SAYS MEANT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND EFFORTS IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS HAVING A POINT PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS THE DD TWO FOURTEEN IN THE MILITARY LIFESTYLE TO WORK WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY. I APPLAUD THE SELF ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THE EFFORTS OF OTHER LICENSING BOARD SUCH AS THE VETERINARY LICENSING BOARD TO OPEN UP THEIR PROCESS SEES. I'M ACCOUNT SO WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM TO ADVANCE THIS ISSUE AND IN FACT TOMORROW WE HOLD THE STATE WIDE DEFENSE SUMMIT. WHICH INCLUDES MILITARY LEADERS AND DEFENSE SUPPORT COMMUNITIES FROM ACROSS THE STATE WE ARE HOLDING TWO PANELS ON THIS VERY ISSUE AND WILL BE CREATING AN ACTION PLAN FROM THAT FORUM. SO HOW MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR INTEREST THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY NO FIVE YEAR FROM ROB RIVER TO.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR BY CALLING HIS A MEETING WITH OUR LEADERS SO HE HAS TO GO. THANK YOU I TWENTY SIX I'M I'M MY NAME IS CARLY CLARK MY HUSBAND IS THE WING COMMANDER OF A DEALER FOR SPACE RURAL BEALE AIR FORCE BASE. I'VE EITHER BEEN IN THE AIRFORCE OR MERRY TO IT FOR TWENTY YEARS I'M VERY THANKFUL FOR THIS CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU FOR THAT I JUST TOOK A COUPLE NOTES AND I WANTED TO. ADDRESS MR GLAZER WAS ASKING FOR SOME CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA AND ALTHOUGH I CAN'T PROVIDE YOU THAT I CAN PROVIDE YOU SOME BEALE SPECIFIC DATA. AND WON. THING OF NOTE THAT CAME UP FROM A SURVEY THAT WE SENT OUT TO OUR SEVEN THOUSAND. US SERVICE MEMBERS ON THE BASE WAS. ABOUT 21% OF OUR SPOUSES HOLDING A LICENSE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND OF THOSE TWENTY PERCENT. 40% SAID THAT THEY WERE UNWILLING TO EVEN ATTEMPT TO PURSUE TRANSFERRING THEIR LICENSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. WHILE YOU TALK ABOUT THE BOARDS. HAVING SOME ACCOUNTABILITY IN TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY'RE GRANTED OR NOT GRANTED. THEY'RE NOT GONNA CAPTURE THAT 40% OF SAUCES THAT DON'T EVEN TRY IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO I JUST WANTED TO. TO MAKE NOTE OF THAT THE OTHER THING THAT I WAS. WANTED TO BRING. UP WAS. OUR ORDERS PROCESS THE MILITARY ORDERS AND HOW THAT WORKS AND- A LOT OF TIMES IF WE GET NOTIFICATION. MONTHS AND MONTHS IN ADVANCE. THAT WE ARE TRANSFERRING SOMEWHERE. BUT WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THOSE. PAPER ORDERS YET. AND IF THERE WERE SOME WAVES FOR OUR SPOUSES TO BE ABLE TO START SOME OF THESE PROCESSES WITH THE BOARD. FOR ACTUALLY. AGAIN CALIFORNIA. SO HELPFUL. A LOT OF THE BOARDS REQUIRE THAT OUR SPOUSES BE. LIVING IN CALIFORNIA ALREADY BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN START THE PROCESS. AND SO THAT OBVIOUSLY PUTS US MONTHS BEHIND AND THEN THE LAST ONE I WANTED TO MAKE WAS OUR CHILD CARE AND THAT CAME UP QUITE A BIT. THE BASE. AT THE OTHER FOR SPACE AND I KNOW ALL THE OTHER INSTALLATIONS WE DO PROVIDE CHILDCARE ON THE BASE. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE. FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THE ISSUE AS- WE CAN GET THEM. SYNCED ON OUR BASE FAIRLY. IT'S GETTING THEM LICENSED OUT THE GATE IN THE STATE. THE CHALLENGE. TO BE ABLE TO SET UP A DAYCARE. IN HOME CARE. THE HELP IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO THAT. HURTS OUR CHILD CARE. NEEDS FOR THE BASE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME APPRECIATE THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS ANYONE ELSE ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. PLEASE I'M FIRST LIEUTENANT PRETTY CURRY AND THE CHIEF OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS ABOUT BILLION FOR SPACE I WORK FOR MRS CLARKSON'S HUSBAND. THE ONE THING THAT WOULD BE AS A COMMUNICATOR THERE'S A LOT OF THE POINTS THAT ARE IN THE BUSINESS CODE OR THAT ARE STATED ARE VERY VAGUE. SO THERE WAS WAYS TO BETTER DEFINE THEM AS POLICY IS BEING LOOKED AT. AS A SOMEONE WHO CONTROLS THE COMMUNICATION ASSETS AT MY BASE I CAN TAKE THOSE AND PROVIDE THOSE LOCALLY AND SO CAN MY PEERS ACROSS THE UNITED THEIR FORCE OR THE DOD AS A WHOLE BUT- STATING COMPARABLE WERE STATING THAT ITS EXPEDITED. WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN AND HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM SO THAT I CAN PROVIDE THAT LOCALLY TO OUR SPOUSES WERE WORK WITH THE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST HONORING SOLUTIONS THAT. PROVIDE THE NEWCOMERS PROCESS THAT WE TAKE IN OUR NEW MEMBERS THAT WE CAN PUSH THAT OUT BUT THE DATA AND THE ACTUAL DETAILS OF IT IS NOT. SO WHEN THOSE QUESTIONS COME TO MY OFFICE WHICH THEY- OFTEN WILL DO BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOOGLE BEALE AIR FORCE BASE MY OFFICE POPS UP BECAUSE WE PROVIDE THAT PUBLIC TOUCH POINT. THOSE ARE THOSE ARE INFORMATION LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM OR I DON'T KNOW. THE NOT CONGLOMERATE. IN A IN A CENTRAL POINT WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH ALL GO INTO THE- FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM A GOOGLE HOLE TRYING TO FIND THIS INFORMATION. AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO ME SO. IF THAT IS THE FINE THEN I CAN TAKE THAT AND I CAN DO SOMETHING AT MY LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP WITH THAT PROCESS. AND THEN EVEN JUST THE TERM SHALL WHICH THERE IS A LAWYER FROM OUR INSULATION. WHO IS. MARRIED SHE IS A PRACTICING LAWYER SHE'S MARRIED TO OUR OUR ACTUAL HEAD LAWYER ON THE INSULATION. SHE STATED THAT SHALL IS JUST A FANCY WORD FOR ME. A SO THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY IN THAT PROCESS IN OUR REGULATIONS. THERE'S SHALL MUST AND WILL. MUST AND WILL YOU WILL DO THAT IS IT YOU ARE REQUIRED BY THAT REGULATION TO DO THAT. SHELL IS A CONSIDERATION OF SOMETHING THAT ONCE YOU'VE COMPLETED THE OTHERS. YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE SOME RISK IN NOT DOING THAT. STILL HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE TO SHALL IS VERY DIFFICULT. BECAUSE IT JUST SAYS YOU CAN'T DO IT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY THAT YOU WILL. SO JUST FROM THE COMMUNICATION SEPARATE IF. IF THAT'S CONSIDERED THAN I CAN DO SOMETHING AT MY LEVEL. BUT WITHOUT THAT. MY HANDS ARE KIND OF TIED TRYING TO HELP SPOUSES FIND THIS INFORMATION AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. WELL I WANT TO THANK A YES PLEASE. MARK PALMER FROM THE SAN DIEGO MILITARY ADVISORY COUNCIL ALSO CALIFORNIA DEFENSE GONNA COMMUNITIES ALLIANCE I JUST LIKE TO COMMENT THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER ON WHERE IS THE DATA.

FOR SKILLED WORKERS IN SAN DIEGO IN PARTICULAR SPOUSES HAVE THOSE SKILLS THE IMPEDIMENT IS SIR LICENSURE LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS UP FOR SOMEONE TO THANK EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR ATTENDING AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE WHO. TOOK THE TIME TO PREPARE AND TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF I'M THANKING YOU ON BEHALF OF MY TWO CHAIRS WHO WERE HERE. A BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS IN THIS PARTICULAR SELECT COMMITTEE. OF THIS IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO ALL OF US IN THE LEGISLATURE SUMMER MORE INFORMED ON IT THAN OTHERS BUT ALL ARE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT WE IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND WE SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. HAVING A CHAIR BEEN A BUDGET PERSON APPEAR FOR THE. INCLUDING MY SEVENTH YEAR APPEAR ON IN ONE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THE OTHER IN FOR SIX YEARS I DID THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR STATE TO GOVERNMENT STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO. MANY OF THESE LICENSING AGENCIES IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER WERE IN FRONT OF ME AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER AND THEIR LOT UP THERE A LOT OF THEM. WE DID NOT GET TO THIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA OVERNIGHT EACH OF THESE OCCUPATIONS IN THE AGENCIES THAT REGULATE LICENSE THEM. OF DEVELOP THE RULES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS LISTENING TO A VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS. SO TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS AS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ISSUE. IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT IT'S NOT THE DIFFICULTY DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T TRY TO DO IT AND TRY TO SUCCEED AND HOPEFULLY SUCCEED BUT IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. TO TRY TO PUT THIS TOGETHER THE ONE THING THAT OCCURRED TO ME AS I WAS LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND AGAIN I DON'T SPEAK FOR MY CHAIRS IS JUST RICHARD ROTH. A KING. IS THE WHATEVER WE DO IN REGARDLESS OF THE PART NOR EIGHT SEE THEIR DEALING WITH INCLUDED CONTROLS LICENSING AND CERTIFICATION. JOB NUMBER ONE NEEDS TO BE ON IT AT LEAST ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. GETTING THEM THE MILITARY SPOUSE PROPERLY LICENSED OR CERTIFICATED IN ANOTHER STATE INTO A JOB AS FAST AS POSSIBLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT. FITS THE SKILLS AND THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL OF THE PERSON INVOLVED. AND WE NEED TO DO THAT AND THEN WE NEED TO ALLOW THE REST OF THE PROCESS TO CATCH UP AS OPPOSED TO DOING IT THE OTHER WAY NOW THERE MAY BE PARTICULAR. OCCUPATIONS PARTICULAR JOBS WHERE FOR SOME VERY IMPORTANT REASONS WE CAN'T DO THAT. BUT THOSE SHOULD BE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE. SO I AM PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK THIS I KNOW I'M COMMITTED AYE AYE BY THIS OF INDICATED WITH MY- FULL LAWYER IN THE ROOM. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK TO LAWYERS WILL CONTINUE TO WORK EVERY OTHER OCCUPATION. FOR A LIFE OF ME I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH CARE FEELS WHY THERE'S A STEP MUCH DIFFICULTY GETTING SOMEONE WHO'S APPROPRIATELY LICENSED AS A PHYSICIAN OR A NURSE OR OF. CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER WORKER SOMEONE ELSE IN ANOTHER STATE INTO A JOB IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHY IT TAKES SO LONG AND WHY IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. AS A ELECTED DEALING WITH CONSTITUENTS IN THE SENATE DISTRICT. A WE HAVE IN OUR DISTRICT WE HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NOT TO BE CRITICAL AND THIS WAS A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WITH THE NURSING BOARD AND TRYING TO GET NURSING NURSES APPROPRIATELY CREDENTIALED IN A TIMELY FASHION IN CALIFORNIA SO HAVING SAID ALL THAT. I'M COMMITTED WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND TO MAKE SURE THE MILITARY SPOUSES. SECURE GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IN THEIR FIELD OF SPECIALTY IN CALIFORNIA AS FAST AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR FAMILIES BE SUCCESSFUL AND FRANKLY. PRESERVE THE MILITARY INSTALLATIONS THEY WERE YOUR PRIVILEGE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE. STAFF THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED THANK YOU FOR TO
