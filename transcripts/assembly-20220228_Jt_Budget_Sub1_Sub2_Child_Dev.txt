MUCH LIKE CLIMATE CHANGED WE ARE FACED WITH A RAPIDLY CLOSING WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARD THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS AND IF THIS IS TRUE THIS IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE- FOR YEARS AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- YOU KNOW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPACTS- ALL ASPECTS OF SOCIETY AND YOU LOOK ABOUT STUDENT SCCESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUCCESS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IT'S HARD TO HAVE SUCCESS IN SCHOOL AND IN LIFE SO I WOULD START A LOT OF THIS WORK TO TRY TO EXPAND. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS FROM OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS TO K. TWELVE TO COLLEGE LAST YEAR'S IT'S EVEN MORE CRITICAL- TODAY AS WE DEAL WITH COVERED IN THE AFTERMATH AND WHAT STUDENTS I DO. GRAPPLE WITH THROUGHOUT THESE LAST TWO YEARS SO WE'RE GONNA START ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND BRING UP OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MISTER THURMAN. HI PLEASE COME UP AS HE'S MAKING HIS WAY UP WE ALL KNOW AYE MR THURMAN CERTAINLY A FRIEND OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND NOW HE'S THE STATE'S TOP LEADER IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. APPLYING AT ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL ROLE IN SHAPING OUR RESPONSE TO. A YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OUR KIDS. YOUR LEADERSHIP IN SUPPORTING OUR CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS. IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL. TAKE TO THE BANK AND YOUR WORK IN THIS ISSUE WHICH I KNOW SOMETHING YOU BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT WHEN YOU'RE ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- IS CLEARLY EVIDENT AND- AS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE WELCOME HERE AND I THINK VERY COMFORTABLE OF COURSE SO MR THURMAN IF YOU COULD PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MCCARTY CHAIRMAN- CHAIRMAN SALAS COMMITTEE AND- TO THE STAFF. THANK YOU FOR TAKING UP THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I MEAN IT'S NOT LOST ON ANY OF YOU. KNOW HOW DIFFICULT. WHAT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FAMILIES HAVE GONE THROUGH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. IF YOU PUT IT IN CONTEXT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MENTAL HEALTH. IN THIS NATION OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY CHILDREN HAVE LOST A PRIMARY OR SECONDARY CARE GIVER. TO KOBE- I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DIFFICULT THAN THAT- WHEN YOU ADD THE NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS WHO'VE LOST THEIR LIVES. DISRUPTIONS OF EVERY KIND. THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE. AND NOT JUST RELATED TO COVERT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF FIRES AND NATURAL DISASTERS THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA DURING KOPET MORE THAN NINETEEN COUNTIES IMPACTED. AND IN MANY CASES OF VERY LIMITED RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE KIND OF TRAUMA SUPPORT FOR THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE LOSS OF A LOVED ONE LOSS OF THE HOME. OR LOSS OF THE SCHOOL. WE'VE EXPERIENCED ACTS OF HATE. AND RACISM THAT HAVE PLAYED OUT ON OUR TELEVISION SCREENS STARTING WITH THE KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD THE SPIKE IN HATE. AGAINST THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW ALL KINDS OF MISTREATMENT OF OUR LGBT Q. PLUS YOUTH. IN THIS STATE AND THE NATIONAL CULTURE THAT THREATENS TRANSGENDER YOUTH AND THREATENS LGBTQ PLUS YOU. I KNOW THAT YOU ALL YOUR STAFF REPORT SAW REPORT FROM THE TREASURE PROJECT THAT TALKED ABOUT 70% OF OUR LGBTQ PLUS YOU'RE- TALKING ABOUT- NEGATIVE HEALTH NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO THE CONTEXT IS CLEAR I'M CERTAIN THAT YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING. YOU CAN'T GO TO A SCHOOL AND NOT HERE- ROM OUR LEADERS. ABOUT STUDENTS WHO ARE SHOWING UP AT SCHOOL WITH MAJOR BEHAVIORAL NEEDS OUR YOUNGEST CHILDREN CRYING FEELING EMOTIONAL OLDER CHILDREN. ACTING OUT SHOWING BEHAVIORAL NEEDS- AND ALL THE LAW. ARE STILL OUR SCHOOLS STRUGGLING TO FIND ENOUGH CLINICIANS AND COUNSELORS TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS. THAT OUR SCHOOLS NEED YEAH YOU KNOW PERFORMED BEFORE TODAY'S HEARING I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH AT LEAST A FIVE OR SIX SUPERINTENDENTS JUST TODAY. EACH OF THEM SAYING THE SAME THING THAT WE WANT TO PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES TO HELP OUR KIDS WE JUST CAN'T FIND THEM I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WE'RE EXPERIENCING A WORLDWIDE STAFF SHORTAGE IN EVERY SINGLE WORK FORCE. THAT IS NOT LIMITED TO WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR SCHOOLS THAT'S NOT LIMITED TO TEACHERS AND BUS DRIVERS IS NOT LIMITED TO. MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS AND COUNSELORS I WANT TO COMMEND ALL OF OUR EDUCATORS IN EVERY SINGLE CAPACITY OUR TEACHERS ARE CLASSIFIED STAFF OR- MENTAL HEALTH LEADERS FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MORE IS NEEDED NOW UNFORTUNATELY IT TOOK A PANDEMIC FOR US TO GET PAST. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH AND I'M GRATEFUL TO THOSE WHO HAVE. PERSISTENTLY TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH OPENLY IN THIS CHAMBER HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLY SUPPORT OF- CERTAINLY THREE SUB ONE AND- THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND SO MANY OTHER PLACES I THANK YOU ALL FOR THE LEADERSHI- THAT YOU ALL HAVE SHOWN. I THANK YOU FOR THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US- YOU'RE GONNA HEAR MORE FROM OF THE MINISTRATION TODAY ABOUT THE CHILDREN'S. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH YOU KNOW INITIATIVE YOU KNOW FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH- TO pCHILDREN. UP THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING THREE BILLION DOLLARS- TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AROUND HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL SERVICES AND WHAT I CALL TRANSFORMATIVE SERVICES TO IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. YOUR TREMENDOUS RESOURCES BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR SCHOOLS BUT THE NEED COULD NOT BE GREATER THAN WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING. AND IT'S NOT NEW TO THE PANDEMIC MANY YOU KNOW THAT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC- BY MOST ACCOUNTS AND WHEN IT CAME TO MEETING THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. CALIFORNIA WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE MAYBE ABOUT 30% OF THAT NEED. AND WHEN YOU LOOK IN A ROW OKAY. THAT HAVE HELLO TAX TO CARE I KNOW A- WHAT IS OFF TALKED IN HEALTH CARE THESE ARE HE- HUGE CHALLENGES. FOR MANY OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO FOR URBAN COMMUNITIES FOR SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES IN FRONT HERE COMMUNITIES AND SO. IT IS WITH THAT THAT I COME BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ASK YOU TO MOVE URGENTLY- WE NEED URGENCY AND HOW WE GO ABOUT THIS WORK. OUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. SUICIDE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN HAS DOUBLED IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN AREAS THAT JUST HAVE A SHORTAGE OF PROFESSIONALS WHO CAN PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH- NEARLY SIX HUNDRED. AREAS THAT SHOW A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER THE WORK THAT IS NEEDED. AND IN THOSE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED COMMUNITIES MOSTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN. LATINO AND NATIVE AMERICAN FAMILIES LIVING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE'RE EXCITED FOR THE COMING RESOURCES THAT ARE GOING TO COME FROM THE CHILDREN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. BUT THAT TAKES TIME TO RAMP UP. FOR THOSE RESOURCES TO GET TO THOSE FAMILIES THAT WILL TAKE TIME. AND AS I HEAR EVERY VISIT THAT I MAKE TO EVERY SCHOOL I HEAR THE SAME THING WE NEED MORE DOLLARS WE NEED MORE RESOURCES WE NEED MORE STAFF. AND OUR WORK FORCE IS JUST LIMITED AND SO WE HAVE. A GREAT DEAL OF WORK AHEAD OF US IT IS THE REASON WHY THIS YOUR RESPONSE ON A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SCHOLARSHIP ESSENTIALLY TO ANYONE. WHO WOULD COMMIT TO SERVICE THE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIAN AND A HIGH NEED AREA BY THE WAY IT IS NOT A SHORT CUT. IN SAYING THAT YOU CAN BECOME A CLINICIAN FASTER IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE PRIORITIZE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES A RULE COMMUNITIES IN FRONT HERE COMMUNITIES. COMMUNITIES THAT NEED MORE MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS. THAT THESE. CANDIDATES TO BECOME A MASTER'S LEVEL CLINICIANS WOULD RECEIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SCHOLARSHIP TO SUPPORT. THEIR I'M SORRY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR SCHOLARSHIPS TO SUPPORT THEIR WAY. TO WORK FOR TWO YEARS THIS IS SB ONE TWO TWO NINE. A BILL THAT WE'RE PROUD TO SPONSOR- THAT WE HOPE WILL HELP US TO GET THERE. THE OTHER THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IS CURRENTLY WORKING TO IMPLEMENT AS HE'S P. IS- ESPECIALLY UPON PROGRAM. TO CALIFORNIA'S DISTRICTS DRAWDOWN MORE MEDIC CAL DOLLARS. I KNOW THAT SHERMAN ARAMBULA HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS A GREAT DEAL OF THE SUB LINE AND- DO IS LEGISLATION. OF CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST FOOTPRINTS OF MEDI CAL IN GENERAL OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FOOTPRINT AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. VERY VERY LIMITED AS YOU ALL KNOW MEDI CAL IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT. THAT MEANS FOR ANYONE WHO QUALIFIES YOU CAN DRAW DOWN AS MUCH MONEY AS NEEDED TO MEET THE NEED. IN THAT COMMUNITY BUT BEING ABLE TO BILL FOR MEDIC CAL UNDERSTANDING THE RULES OF MEDICARE NOW. THAT TAKES SOME WORK I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I WORK FOR FIVE YEARS FOR SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION WHERE WE USE MEDI CAL. TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AND SO FOR THAT REASON- WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU ALL SAW IT FIT. TO PUT INTO THE BUDGET A BILL THAT WE SPONSOR LAST YEAR DOLLARS TO WORK WITH MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. TO ESSENTIALLY TEACHING COACH AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THEM. ON HOW THEY USE MEDICARE. OUR STAFF IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL BE HERE TODAY TO. ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS. I'M HAPPY. THESE QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR ME WHILE I'M HERE. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS ABILITY. TO RECOVER ACADEMICALLY FROM TIME LOSS. DURING THE PANDEMIC. ASIDE FROM THAT I CAN THINK OF NO JOB MORE IMPORTANT. THANK HEARING FOR THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. IN THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS TO HEAL FROM THE TRAUMA. TO HELP OUR STUDENTS WE COVER. AND THEN THEY HELP THEM THRIVE IN THESE PROGRAMS IN MENTAL HEALTH WILL DO EXACTLY THAT. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. CAN I RESPECTFULLY- WELL. I THOUGHT I. WAS GONNA PRESENTABLE. I SEE IN HAPPY TO ANY QUESTIONS MIGHT YEAH. IT'S HABIT FORMING VERY I JUST USED TO SAY I WAS. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THE YOUNG. OF OUR STATE AND SUPPORTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND-WELLBEING. HERE WE GO. S. IS FOR R. C. PUBLICANS. MISTER O'DONNELL. I THINK IT'S ONE THINK THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR HIS PRESENTATION AND- IS GREAT CONCERN FOR THE STATE OF OUR SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW I'M CONCERNED MYSELF. EARNED I SENATE CHILD OFF TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY- CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE ALSO A TEACHER. I'VE BEEN IN THE CLASSROOM I RETURNED IN SEPTEMBER A BET SUBBAN OFF SO I'VE SEEN WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR SCHOOLS. THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE STAFF GEORGE AS AS YOU HAVE NOTED- THERE'S MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR OTHER ISSUES GOING ON IN OUR SCHOOLS. BUT ONE OF THE THAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN AGREE ON I HOPE. AT LEAST IS GOING FORWARD WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON A SMALLER CLASS SIZES. IT WAS SHARED WITH ME BY A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR RECENTLY. KIND OF STRUCK ME YEAH IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS OUR CLASS SIZES ARE SO LARGE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IT INHIBITS A TEACHER FROM REALLY GETTING TO KNOW THE STUDENTS OFTEN TIMES- CONNECTICUT OTHER STATES CLASS SIZES MUCH SMALLER CALIFORNIA MUCH LARGER. AND I CAN TELL YOU AS A AS A SUB DURING THE FALL AND MANY COULD RUN A SCHOOL- FOR BEING QUARANTINED EXETER. MANY OTHER CLASSES OR MAYBE TWENTY TWO KIDS IN THE TELL YOU THAT SETS A DIFFERENT TONE. ESPECIALLY AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL WHERE I WAS. SO I HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CAN PRY PRIORITIZE- CLASS SIZE REDUCTION COUNSELORS- IN AND ENABLING DISTRICTS TO. TACKLE THE NEEDS THAT ARE IN THEIR DISTRICT BECAUSE IT MAY NOT BE ONE UNIFORM. CHALLENGE ACROSS THE STATE. AND I LOOK OF IF I LOOK AT THE PROPOSED BUDGET THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IT THERE'S A SMALL AD ON CALL A FIVE POINT THREE THREE PERCENT. YET FOR DISTRICTS JUST TO TASTE STATIC WITH EXPENSES CPI IS AT SEVEN POINT 5% RIGHT. PERSON STIRS AVERAGE ABOUT BY TWO POINT 35% AND THERE'S ABOUT 4% OTHER COSTS. THAT ARE UNIQUE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE PART OF THE CPI THAT THEY'RE GOING TO- THAT THEY ARE FACING SOTHAT'S AT WORK THIRTEEN POINT EIGHTY FIVE PER. THIRTEEN POINT 85% JUST FOR DISTRICTS TO SAY STATIC. I'M WITH LAST YEAR YEAH WE'VE GOT A PROPOSED COLA IN THE BUDGET ONLY OF ONLY FIVE POINT 33% OF WE WANT DISTRICTS TO LOWER CLASS SIZES. WHICH I THINK IS A NO BRAINER FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT SPEAKS TO STUDENT HEALTH. IT ALSO SPEAKS TO TEACHER HEALTH. YOU WANT TO RECRUIT. MORE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM YOU WANT TEACHERS TO STAY HEALTHY. LOWER THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS THEY HAVE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD HEY LIGHTEN THE CASELOADS THAT CAN REALLY GET TO KNOW THEIR STUDENTS AND REALLY ADDRESS OUR ECONOMIC ACADEMIC NEEDS. BUT ALSO YOUR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH NEEDS SO I HOPE GOING FORWARD YOU CAN I CAN YOU AND I CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AS THE BUDGET MOVES DOWN THE LINE FOR THIS YEAR WE CONTINUE CAN CONTINUE TO- TO LOOK AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO. TO MEET LOCAL DISTRICTS NEED SENT TO ME FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT CERTAINLY MEANS. ADDING ON TO THE BASE ALLOCATION A GOOD A GOOD AMOUNT HEALTHY AMOUNTS OF THE DISTRICTS WILL HAVE THE FUNDS THE REVENUE. THEY NEED TO LOWER CLASS SIZES TO HIRE COUNSELORS AND TACKLE SOME OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT OUR SCHOOL SITES SO WITH THAT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTENDENT. THANK YOU SIR I APPRECIATE YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR COMMENTS TONIGHT I WAS THINKING THAT THERE'S A TIME WHEN WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT TWENTY TWO STUDENTS WAS ACTUALLY. WAS A SMALL CLASS SIZE AND UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE EXPERIENCE THE INTENSITY THAT WE EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTSNEED A LOT MORE INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT. A ONE TO ONE SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC- IT'S SAD TO SEE TO NOTE THE NUMBER OF- YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE TO A HOSPITALIZATION FOR EMERGENCIES IT'S UP IT'S UP SOME AGES OF THIRTEEN AND TWENTY ONE SO. IT'S VERY MUCH WITHIN THAT AGE RANGE AND GRADE SPAN THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS A MIDDLE SCHOOL IN OF WHAT WE DO AROUND HIGH SCHOOL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THE WORKFORCE CHALLENGES ARE SIGNIFICANT WEVE EXPERIENCED THEM. THIS WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN GENEROUS IN SAYING THAT THEY CAN BE A NURSE CONSULTANT AND WE CAN BUILD A SMALL HELP OFFICE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. HEY WE'RE FINDING TO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT THESE POSITIONS AND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE VERY- LIKE OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE TO HAVE DIFFERENT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. COMPENSATION AND TRAINING AND BUILDING A PATHWAY TO BUILD THAT THAT WORKFORCE AND OF COURSE HAVING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WHETHER IT'S ADDED TO THE BASE OR RECOGNIZING THE COST OF EDUCATION ALL THESE THINGS WILL. HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE CONVERSATIONS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH- AS WE SPEAK AND- WE'VE CREATED A WORK FORCE ON A WORK GROUP THAT'S FOCUS ON- HOW TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGES AND WORKING WITH A LOT OF PARTNERS IN THE FIRST THING THAT COMES UP. IS COMPENSATION- THE AND WE LOOK AT THE DATA TO SEE WHERE PEOPLE- HAVE LEFT JOBS IN OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND THEY'VE LEFT AND THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL KINDS OF CONVERSATION. CLASS SIZE HAS TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION IT CERTAINLY TO REVENUE TO HELP. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS INCREASE COP AND A- TRAINING PRO. WILL BE I'M JUST NOT THAT. WE REQUIRED SCHOOLS WE'VE AND SAYS YET THIS STILL DOESN'T HAVE ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES BACK THE TEACHERS SERVICE REALLY STEPPED UP- AS OF STUDENTS FOR SURE AND NOT JUST TEACHERS I SEE EDUCATORS MEANING GENERAL JANITORS ALL SCHOOL SITE PERSONAL. TO MAKE THIS WORK SO I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO HIGHLIGHT- THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR YOUTH AS WELL THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU. OKAY WE HAVE- A DOCTOR WOOD MISTER SEYARTO MISTER RAMBLER I HAVE A QUESTION DR WITH. GREAT WELL THANK YOU MR SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE AND- AND ESPECIALLY TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE ON THE STAFFING ISSUES ESPECIALLY RUN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- THERE- IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME AT THIS POINT I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT SOME PRETTY BIG NUMBERS FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS I GUESS FOR THIS. FOR THIS INITIATIVE. WE'RE STILL NOT REALLY SURE WHERE THAT'S GOING TO GO- AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT- BUT I WILL SAY THAT GOING BACK THINKING ABOUT WORKFORCE I WAS SAT ON THE WORKFORCE COMMISSION FIVE ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO NOW- THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED AROUND- WORKFORCE. IN IN THE HEALTHCARE SPACE MENTAL HEALTH BEING ONE OF THE VERY TOP. PIECES OF THE PUZZLE IT WAS A THE RECOMMENDATIONS CAME OUT AS A THREE BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE OF THAT WE COULD LOOK OUT OVER A TEN YEAR PERIOD. TO REALLY ENHANCE THAT AND COVE IT IS ONLY ME HIT IN EXAGGERATED AND MADE THIS WORSE AND SO I HOPE THAT- AND RECOGNIZING THAT THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKFORCE THESE ARE THIS A LONGER TERM. SOLUTION ARE ALSO LONGER TERM PROCESS TO GET TO THAT SOLUTION BUT BUT I BELIEVE IT'S CRITICAL- INDEPENDENT THE ENTIRE BEHAVIORAL SPECTRUM THAT WE NEED MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO HELP IN THIS SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- BEING HERE TODAY AND- BEFORE TO SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT- I CAN SAY HONESTLY I LEFT THIS HOUSE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND WHEN YOU WERE CHEERING HEALTH COMMITTEE AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. A LACK OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS THEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THESE RE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE EXISTED PRE PANDEMIC AND THEY'VE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED AGAIN YOU KNOW THE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS A STUDY BY KAISER. THE KAISER FOUNDATION THAT SAID CALIFORNIA'S MEETING ABOUT 30% OF THE NEED. FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT WAS ONLY FOR FAMILIES THAT WERE PERSISTENT BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT TO ME AND OTHERS THAT EVEN FAMILIES THAT WERE PERSISTENT IF THERE WEREN'T PROVIDERS PRESENT. AT IT PERSISTENCE DIDN'T ADD UP TO ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND SO. THE NEED IS GREAT I YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE PRESENTATION. THAT YOU'LL GET FROM THE FOLKS WHO- LEADING THE CHILDREN'S. HEALTH INITIATIVE THINK THAT THEY ANSWER. YOUR ABOUT THE FOUR POINT THREE BILLION INITIATIVE I THINK. I THINK IT BEST IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT AS LONG TERM BUT WE- WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP- WITH THAT DEPARTMENT AND WE APPRECIATE. THAT IT ENVISIONS- PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FROM BIRTH TO TWENTY FIVE. AND AS YOU KNOW MORE THAN MOST- THERE ARE SO MANY GAPS THATEXIST. NOT EVERYONE QUALIFIES FOR MEDICARE- THERE WORKING FAMILIES WHO ARE LOW INCOME WE HAVE SOME HEALTH INSURANCE BUT NOT ENOUGH HEALTH INSURANCE. THERE'S SOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THAT JUST DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH- THAT INITIATIVE REALLY INTENDS TO HELP FILL GAPS- FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BIRTH TO TWENTY FIVE. THIS HEAVY LIFTING AHEAD FOR SURE BUT WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON HOW. TO TO REALLY THIS IS OUR MOMENT- MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR A LONG TIME- THE PANDEMIC HAS. JUST EXACERBATED THE LEVEL OF URGENCY WITH WHICH WE NEED TO. OPERATE TO HELP MEET THE NEEDS. OF THE VOTING I FOR YOUR BILL TO. THANK YOU. THIS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SIR THE MENTAL HEALTH ASPECT OF THIS HAS BEEN PILED ON TO WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE WHICH IS SOME SPECIALIZED EDUCATION FOR OTHER KIDS ARE SPEECH PATHOLOGY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. N. H. I'M WONDERING HOW WE'RE GETTING. HOW WE'RE GETTING THE WORD LIKE YOU WERE SAYING THE WORKFORCE IS THE WORKFORCE KEEPING UP WITH THOSE OTHER OTHER ISSUES AS WELL OR DO WE HAVE ISSUES ALL ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE WHEN I'M FINDING WHEN I TALKED TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW THAT ARE IN THE FIELD- THEY'RE NOT FRUSTRATED BY AS MUCH AS THE PAY ALTHOUGH THEY LIKE MORE PAY. THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BY THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO CASELOADS WHERE THEY'RE GOING HOME WITH FORTY REPORTS TO WRITE AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE THERE ANYTHING IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO LIGHTEN THOSE LOADS. OR DO YOU WANT ARE WE JUST HAVE TO GO FIND PEOPLE THAT ARE QUALIFIED TO DO THIS WORK. BECAUSE WE'RE IF WE'RE NOT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO BE ABLE TO. YEAH I GET PEOPLE THAT ARE QUALIFIED BOTH FOR COUNSELING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BUT ALSO FOR THE OTHER THINGS BECAUSE IF THOSE KIDS DON'T GET THEIR HELP THEY BECOME BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ALSO. BECAUSE THEY GET FRUSTRATED. AND AND THEY GET OSTRACIZED BECAUSE THEY DON'T SPEAK RIGHT. OR WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS. SO THAT'S MY QUESTION IS THAT ALL KIND OF. KIND OF WORKING UP INTO THIS. THIS THING WE HAVE TODAY WHERE WE NEED EVERYBODY AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY. I DON'T APPRECIATING- YOUR YOUR- POINTS THAT YOU'VE MADE SURE BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT WE OFTEN ALIGN OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS WITH SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND- THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT AREA GOING BACK TO THE START OF THE PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT. SPECIAL EDUCATION WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE DELIVERED TO DISTRICTS LEARNING AND SO THAT MEANT A LOT OF FAMILIES COULDN'T GET ASSESSMENTS AND THINGS THAT THEY NEEDED VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND AGAIN I WANT TO COMMEND THE EDUCATORS AND THE FAMILIES AND THE STUDENTS FOR THEIR RESILIENCE. AND AS YOU POINT OUT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE SEEN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITS IN- OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT AS A STATE- SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS ONE ONE AIDES IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THAT OFTEN WHY PEOPLE LEAVE THE FIELD IS WORKING CONDITIONS. ARE EDUCATORS WERE READY EXPERIENCING THE MOST DIFFICULT WORKING CONDITIONS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND SO IF WE'RE GOING TO FIND WAYS TO HAVE THE SPEECH PATHOLOGIST IN THE ONE THE ONES IN SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHERS WHO CAN- PROVIDE THE NEED FOR OUR STUDENTS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT TRAINING AND COMPENSATION IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS. LOWERING CASELOADS I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT SIR- VERY SIMILAR TO THE POINTS THAT WE HEARD FROM COLLEAGUES OF LONG BEACH YOU KNOW THIS IS- THIS IS CRITICAL AND I HEAR FROM I HEAR FROM EDUCATORS WHO ARE IN THE FRONT LINE WHO ARE WORKIN WITH OUR FAMILIES AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION AND IT IS SO DIFFICULT. IT IS THE COMBINATION OF THE INTENSITY OF THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH THE LACK OF THE SUPPORT- THAT ARE OFTEN NEEDED AND THE LITIGIOUS NATURE THAT MANY OF OUR- DISTRICTS HAVE TAKEN OFF AND MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE STARTED TO JUST SAY NO TO SERVICES BECAUSE OF COST. YEAH AND- YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M ONE WHO BELIEVES IN MORE MEDIATION TO RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO DO WHAT'S IN THE INTERESTS OF THE STUDENT AND WHAT'S IN THAT STUDENT'S. IEP AND WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS AND SO EVERYONE IS FEELING FRUSTRATION- AND WE ARE SEEING- MAJOR CHALLENGES AROUND FIELD POSITIONS LIKE ONE ONE IN. A SPEECH. LINE BUT- AND- OTHER SPECIALISTS WHO SUPPORT. OF THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR RAMBLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FIRST MR SUPERINTENDENT YOUR APPEARANCE TODAY AND ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS A SIGN OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU- FROM A FORMER MEMBER I JUST APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT- AS A CHAIR OF SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITIES THAT THIS ISSUE REQUIRES. AND WHILE WILL SPEND MOST OF TODAY SPEAKING ABOUT CHILDREN I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ADULTS AS IT IS APPARENT THAT WE THE ADULTS ARE ALSO GOING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THE WILD FIRES AND THE HATE CRIMES AND THE- DIFFICULTIES THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND- SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS WHO ARE- EMBATTLED. AND TEACHERS WHO MUST BE FATIGUED IT. IT'S HARD TO FILL ANYONE ELSE'S BUCKET IF YOUR BUCKET IS EMPTY THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE ARE SUPPORTING THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND THE TEACHERS SO THAT THEY THEN CAN TURN AROUND AND HELP US TO. SUPPORT OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU SEE CHAIR AYE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT MORE IS NEEDED THIS IS AN AREA WHERE- OUR SYSTEMS TEND TO RELY ON WHAT THE DISTRICTS OFFER. AND SOMETIMES DISTRICTS DO OFFER GREAT PLEA ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT I CAN TELL YOU IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH THERE'S A INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF FATIGUE- FOR EDUCATORS- AND EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATORS AND WE'RE SEEING. LEVELS ARE RETIREMENT THAT ARE UNPRECEDENTED- TEACHERS CLASSIFIED STAFF ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERS. LEAVING THE PROFESSION- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS A GREAT PROFESSION AND WE NEED A CALL TO ACTION TO ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO THE PROFESSION BUT WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE- EDUCATIONAL LEADERS ARE UNDER EXTREME FATIGUE. RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE ANGRY ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE- AND- IT IT IT ALWAYS FALLS ON TO TEACHERS IN CLASS I STAFF AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS OUR PARENTS ARE HURTING. EVERYONE IS HURTING IN IN SO I KNOW THAT THE SURGEON GENERAL'S OFFICE IS BUILDING SOME PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT EDUCATORS AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- YEAH I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THAT WORK IS AT THE BEGINNING. AND IT AND IT NEEDS TO BE GROWN IT NEEDS TO BE INTENTIONAL I THINK TEAMS TO SAY ARTIST POINTS THAT IF WE DON'T COME UP WITH WAYS TO ADDRESS WORKING CONDITIONS AND THE FATIGUE THAT MANY WHO PROVIDE FOR OUR CHILDREN- EXPERIENCE WE WILL KEEP. YOU TO LEAVE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ATTRACT NEW EDUCATORS AND. CLINICIANS- TO THE PROFESSION. I THANK YOU FOR THE AND WILL SAY HAVING BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF HEALTH CARE IT'S OFTEN TIMES. MAKING SURE THAT OUR ABILITY TO BUILD RESILIENCE WITHIN PROVIDERS THOSE WHO CONTINUED TO SHOW UP DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IN OUR TEACHERS WILL ALLOW US TO CREATE THE SUSTAINABILITY THAT WE NEED GOING FORWARD. THE CHAIR I KNOW YOU WORK IN EMERGENCY HEALTH AND- GIVE YOUR STATEMENT MADE ME THINK OF OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. NURSES AND OTHERS WHO WORK IN IN IN VARIOUS HEALTH SETTINGS AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE SEEING NUMBERS GO DOWN- THE LEVEL OF THE T. MUST BE SIGNIFICANT. AND IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU SEEN- THAT HAD BEEN HOPEFUL OVER THE YEARS AND HOW TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF THOSE WHO WORK IN EMERGENCY HEALTH AND FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WE CAN BORROW FROM. WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE SUB ONE COMMITTEE AND YOUR STAFF ON ON HOW TO TRY AND BUILD THOSE PROGRAMS OUT. I LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP ON THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS I THINK THEY ARE NECESSARY. I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THIS IS OUR MOMENT AS YOU BROUGHT REAL URGENCY TO THIS AS- I TRIED TO AS WELL DURING MY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS. THAT I'D LIKE TO GET A SENSE THE- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THIS. IS FIVE YEARS HOW CAN WE MAKE- AND BRING THAT URGENCY WHAT CAN WE DO TO IMPLEMENTED EARLIER ON AND THAT FIVE YEAR PLAN AND- WHEN DO. WE HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER REAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS. YOU KNOW QUE QUESTIONS I I'M COGNIZANT THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S SPEAKING TO THIS DIRECTLY BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE EASIEST THING IN THE SMARTEST THING TO DO IS TO BRING THE VOICES OF LOCAL EDUCATION LEADERS INTO THE CONVERSATION- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY THIS THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THOSE WHO WORK IN SCHOOL COMMUNITIES TO FEEL LIKE. A LOT OF HEAVY LOAD GETS PASSED DOWN TO THEM FROM THE STATE AND WE'VE ALWAYS FIND TIME TO INCLUDE THEM INTO THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND- IT IS SO THEIR TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES THERE I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SOMEONE. FROM OUR MENTAL HEALTH ADVISE YOU OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE INCREDIBLE JUST KNOWLEDGE AND YOU KNOW THEY DO A LOT WITH JUST A LITTLE AND I JUST THINK THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IF WE BRING ALL THE RIGHT- PARTNERS INTO THE ROOM STUDENTS WE YOU KNOW WE JUST CREATED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE FIRST EVER- YOUTH ADVISORY COMMISSION HERE FROM YOUNG PEOPLE. ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS I'VE BEEN IN SCHOOLS WHERE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN THE PEER MENTORS AROUND STUDENTS WHO ARE DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND DEPRESSION AND THEY WERE SKILLFUL AND THEY MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY AND THEY DID THINGS THAT YOU KNOW ADULTS WOULDN'T. YEAH I'M I'M WORRIED ABOUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT SOCIAL ISOLATION YOU KNOW THIS WAS A HUGE CHALLENGE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC I THINK WORSENED BY THE PANDEMIC AGAIN I'M GRATEFUL TO THIS HOUSE AND A TO THIS BODY FOUR- CREATING A THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT THAT WE ARE NOW IMPLEMENTING TO ADDRESS SOCIAL ISOLATION. I THINK THERE IS MORE ALMOST THREE HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE APPLIED FOR THE GRANT AND THAT TELLS YOU THAT THE NEEDS ARE GREAT AND I THINK OF WE CAN SPEND ENOUGH TIME LISTENING TO THOSE THAT WE SERVE OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FAMILIES ARE EDUCATORS- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FINE TUNE THESE PROGRAMS. SO THEY ROLL OUT IN A WAY THAT- MATCHES THE NEED THAT EXIST AND THAT WE ARE ALL MOVING WITH SWIFT URGENCY- TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS BECAUSE NOW IS THE MOMENT- IN A AND- YEAH I'M GREAT ADVICE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THEY THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW TO HELP SCHOOLS THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP NOW AND IF WE CAN MAKE THAT A PRIORITY I THINK. WE'D ALL BE BEST SERVED. AT THE FINAL COMMENT AS AS YOU ARE BEGINNING TO CREATE THIS SYSTEM I. HOPE WE KEEP IN MIND THAT- OUR STATE IS VERY DIVERSE. AND OUR NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE. BOTH CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY SENSITIVE TO OUR DIVERSITY WILL EMPOWER THOSE PROGRAMS TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT AND HELP US TO BUILD TRUST. THAT'S NEEDED FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT MANY OF THESE- SENSITIVE SUBJECTS AND SO- I JUST LOOK FORWARD TO ASK BUILDING OUT A- SYSTEM THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF AND- LOOK FORWARD TO THAT PARTNERSHIP SUPERINTEND. YOU CAN ANALYZE A HUGE HERE FROM THE ADVOCATE TO LIKE CHILDREN NOW AND OTHERS. THE MARKS THAT THEY GIVE THE STATE FOR ITS ABILITY TO MEET THE NEEDS AROUND BEHAVIOR HEALTH ARE ACTUALLY RATHER LOW- IN SOME OF THEIR STUDIES THEY'VE GIVEN US A GREAT THAT'S JUST ABOVE THE- CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN THE MENTAL HEALTH. FIELD HAS BEEN HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO REIMAGINE HOW WE DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH. IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US AS I MENTIONED IF THERE'S ALMOST SIX HUNDRED AREAS. IN THE STATE THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- AND AS I MENTIONED A MAJORITY OF THOSE- HAVING RESIDENTS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND- NATIVE AMERICAN. THAT TELLS US THAT WE HAVE TO YES- MOVE URGENTLY TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH FOR ALL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO BE SENSITIVE TO PROVIDING A DIVERSE WORK FORCE- AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT- OUR BILL TO PROVIDE THESE pA COMMITMENT- WILL HELP TO DO THAT. WE ALSO THINK THAT THESE GROW YOUR OWN PROGRAMS ARE EVERYTHING WE HAVE TO RECRUIT IN WAYS WE'RE STUDENTS TODAY. ARE THINKING ABOUT. ENTERING THE PROFESSION AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AS AN EDUCATOR- YOU OUR CAREER. TECHNICAL AT PRO THAT NEED TO BE FILLED TOMORROW THIS YEAR WERE- UNDER THE- AUTHORSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- COOPER- WE ARE OFFERING A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE A PAID INTERNSHIP- TO A C. T. E. STUDENTS BECAUSE WE WANT. TO PROVIDE- FIRST OF COURSE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO LEARN ABOUT THE JOBS OF TOMORROW. BUT WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY THE CLASSROOM TO DIVERSIFY OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS WE HAVE TO RECRUIT IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY. AND THERE HAS TO BE A INTENTIONALITY AND HOW WE DO THAT IF YOU WANT THE RESULT TO CHANGE- AND SO GIVEN WHAT WE'RE SEEING- FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN LATINO STUDENTS LGBTQ PLUS STUDENTS. WE HAD THE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT ONE BRINGING TOGETHER A MORE DIVERSE WORKFORCE AND PROVIDING THE KIND OF TRAINING IN CULTURAL COMPETENCY. AND ADDRESSING BIAS A CHECKING BIAS AT THE DOOR TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE HELPING OUR KIDS ARE ABLE TO HELP WITHOUT ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. OKAY THANK YOU PRODUKTER CHOI. THANK CHAIR AND ON A SMALL- SUPERINTENDENT- THURMOND IN TO SEE YOU IN PERSON US ON A LOT OF WHAT ISSUES IS PASSIONATELY OF PORN EDUCATION AND ON ALSO TODAY WE ARE BEEN WITH THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. AMONG OTHER THINGS SO R. I'M NOT ADDRESSED TO AREAS OF MOMENT MARIUS OF WHAT AREAS THAT THAT'LL CAN TALK ABOUT. NUMBER ONE IS. I HEAR A LOT ABOUT LEARNING GAPS ARE THROUGH THIS SAW. HELLO IN PERSON LEARNING- ETCETERA HOW FAR HAVE YOU DETERMINED. EACH CHILDREN SO LOADING GAP- IT WAS SAID THE OWNER- GENERAL STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT THE DOCTOR YOU USUALLY YOU'LL SEE ANNUALLY. R. OR A DIFFERENT MECHANISM DID YOU USE THAT SO ONE QUESTION. SECONDLY HOW IF YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED DONE SUCH A LEARNING GAPS A- HOW ARE YOU GONNA. WHAT. MASTERLESS ARE YOU IMPLEMENTING TO NARROW THE GAP THAT'S THE SECOND QUESTION. ARE CERTAINLY ARE WE HEAR ARE ARE LAUDABLE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- AND BEHAVIORALLY ISSUES. I'M SURE THAT THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM DISCOURSE I GUESS AT THREE EXPERIENCE AND THAT ACTUALLY PHASE AND THEN ASK QUESTIONS OF TEACHERS SO MAYBE PARENTS UP IN THE FIELD- I WONDER. AMONG MANY POSSIBLE OR OUR BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL ISSUES. CAN YOU TELL ME. WHAT THE TYPICAL ONE WHAT TOOL BEHAVIORS THAT HAS- EVOLVE DUE TO DISAPPOINTING DATA. AND ALLOW OUR HERE. THAT THE A LOT MORE RESOURCES SO TOO HIGH YOU ARE SHORTAGE OF ALL STAFF MEMBERS TO OUR EXPERTISE OF THAT'S WHAT TO TALK ABOUT THE- IF WE- PROVIDE- ALL NECESSARY RESOURCES SO. ARE ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND OF A PERSON NOW. THERE HAS TO BE A SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE SIDE NOT JUST A GENERAL MOORER'S. TO IDENTIFY SUCH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND BEHAVIORS. SO- WHOM DO YOU PLAN TO HIRE YOU- AND WHAT WILL THEY DO. IT IS THEIR JOB TO IDENTIFY. THE CHILDREN WITH THE OP MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR BEHAVIORAL ISSUES. OR ARE THEY GOING TO PROVIDE COUNSELING THE JOB WILL BE JUST LIMITED TO IDENTIFYING THEM TO NOTIFY THE PARENTS OF FOR THEM TO TAKE TO EXT THE ONLY DOCTORS. I TO THE JAIL IF I COULD I'LL TRY ADDRESS THE KEY POINTS IF YOU REYES AND JUST TRY TO- ALIGNED COMMENTS- BRIEFLY- BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE OTHER WITNESSES TODAY BUT- YOU ASKED ABOUT LEARNING GAPS- YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCELERATE LEARNING AN OFFSET THOSE GAPS AND YOU ASKED ABOUT HOW DO WE IDENTIFY AND TREAT. AROUND MENTAL HEALTH- AND SO- THAT'S MY SCORECARD IF I'VE MISSED ANYTHING PLEASE LET ME KNOW- FIRST WHILE LEARNING GAPS WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS THEM SINCE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHERE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP OR THE OPPORTUNITY GET FOR DECADES. AND IT HAS BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE PANDEMIC IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH THE MILLION STUDENTS GOING INTO- DISTANCE LEARNING WITHOUT A COMPUTER ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. THERE IS GOING TO BE GAPS AND SO WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR STUDENTS TO OFFSET THAT THIS HOUSE HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE WONDERFUL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THAT. UNIVERSAL T. K. FOR EVERY SINGLE FOUR YEAR OD THANK YOU CHAIRMAN CARTING THE MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE BEEN ADVOCATING THAT FOR DECADES YOU KNOW THE SOONER THAT OUR STUDENTS GET ACCESS TO THAT OUR MAJORITY LEADER HAS WORKING ON EARLY EDUCATION INITIATIVES FOR MANY YEARS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS HAS A BILL. THAT WOULD ALLOW THE GROUP OR NEIGHBORHOOD BASED TRYS TO WORK INTO THE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE HIGH NEEDS AND SO THE RESOURCES ARE COMING TOGETHER DURING THE PANDEMIC AT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE THE GREATEST NEED THE RESOURCES ARE ALSO COMING TOGETHER. THE WAY IT WORKS IN A MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT- I AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BILL THAT I MENTIONED TO YOU THAT WE ARE SPONSORING THAT WOULD PROVIDE A SCHOLARSHIP TO SOMEONE WHO WAS A MASTER'S LEVEL CANDIDATE SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO GET A MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK ON MATH. AND COUNSELING- A MASTERS AND FAMILY FAMILY THERAPY- THAT WOULD CREATE A SCHOLARSHIP FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AS THEY ENTER A GRADUATE LEVEL PROGRAM TO BECOME TRAINED AS A CLINICIAN TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR FAMILIES AND SO THEY CAN BE A PART OF IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS BUT THEY CERTAINLY. WILL BE A PART OF SOME TREATMENT NOT JUST NOT JUST SAYING THE FAN. YOUR CHILD HAS- YOU KNOW DEPRESSION I WOULD SAY THAT WHAT WE SEE THE MOST SAY IN TERMS OF YOUNG PEOPLE RIGHT NOW HIS DEPRESSION. I SAID WE SEE A RISE IN. A SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AND THERE'S EEN A SPIKE IN ATTEMPTS AND SUICIDE WHAT AGE GROUP ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT TYPICAL. WELL I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH DATA BUT SIGNIFICANT FOURTEENTH IN OUR- IN OUR SCHOOLS AS I MENTIONED. THERE'S BEEN A 42% INCREASE IN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF THIRTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. DURING THE PANDEMIC AND SO I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU IN YOUR OFFICE WITH MORE DATA. I'M HAPPY TO INVITE YOU TO SCHOOLS IN YOUR DISTRICT- I KNOW THAT WE'RE INTENDING TO HAVE A MEETING WITH YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT SHORTLY. BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT SCHOOLS IN YOUR AREA. YOUR SCHOOLS IN YOUR AREA THAT HAVE SOME OF THE BEST. COMMUNITY SCHOOL PROGRAMS ANYWHERE MEANING THEY'VE MADE THE SCHOOL THE CENTER THE HUB FOR A NUMBER OF SERVICES. THAT FAMILIES COULD NOT NORMALLY AT ELSEWHERE BUT THEY HAVE AN ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH THOSE SERVICES THROUGH THE SCHOOL. AND OFTEN BE REFERRED INTO THE COMMUNITY FOR DEEPER LEVEL OF SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S HEALTH OR MENTAL HEALTH. OR SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO OUR SCHOOLS ARE ARE WORKING TO BE EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE THE BEST THAT WE CAN HELP OUR STUDENTS RECOVER. ACADEMICALLY AND TO MEET THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING NEEDS. TO PROGRAMS LIKE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND MORE MENTAL HEALTH. OKAY WECAN DISCUSS MORE ABOUT DOLLARS TOP PEACEFUL FOUR MONTHS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS. THANK YOU MISTER THANK YOU MISTER BERMAN FOR BEING HERE AND FOR EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO FOR STUDENTS- WE KNOW THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY CHALLENGING AND YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF ASK A SPECIFIC QUESTION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE ANSWERED A LOT SOME OF IT AND SOME OF YOUR PREVIOUS ANSWERS BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS. AND WHAT'S GOING ON AT OUR SCHOOLS I WAS JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAD LIKE A BEST PRACTICES MODEL OF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND THE STATE BECAUSE I KNOW FOR FIRST BACK IN IN MY DISTRICT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'VE REALLY DEDICATED A LOT OF RESOURCES TOWARDS BUILDING AT HEALTH CENTERS THAT SOME OF OUR SCHOOL SITES MADE IT NOW IF YOU HAVE FILED YOUR OFFICES LOOKED AT YOU KNOW IS THIS THE MECHANISM IN WHICH WE CAN UTILIZE. TO HELP WITH SOME OF THESE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES OR IS IT GOING THROUGH THE COUNSELORS I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THINGS LIKE AT YOUR PEER MENTORS AND IDENTIFYING SOCIAL ISOLATION BUT IS THERE LIKE A BEST PRACTICES OR YOU KNOW CAN WE USE THESE HEALTH CENTERS TO KIND OF HELP. GET THE STUDENTS THE HELP THAT THEY NEED IN THE RESOURCES THEY NEED WHAT THE FACULTY AND THE STUDENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL THANK YOU SIR MEMBER I WOULD JUST SAY THAT SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTERS CLINICS AND COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ARE MONKS I WOULD SAY THE TOP A BEST PRACTICE MODELS FOR A DELIVERY- YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO LEARN WHEN YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGE OF PHYSICAL CHALLENGE EVEN A DENTAL EACH ISSUE- AND IN MANY CASES SCHOOLS HAD BECOME THE CENTER IN A WAY TO HELP CONNECT FAMILIES TO IMPORTANT. SERVICES SERVICES ARE IN THIS. I AM CASES AS THE NEW CASE OF THE- SCHOOL MODEL. THE KEY. SCHOOLS ESSENTIALLY HELPS CONNECT THE FAMILY TO RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY CAN GET MORE SUPPORT. I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU YOU REITERATED IT. THESE PURE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY OFTEN WORK THROUGH THE HEALTH CENTERS. DURING THE PANDEMIC THE HEALTH CENTERS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES HAVE BECOME. A PLACE FOR OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES TO GO AND GET THEIR HELP. OUR SCHOOLS HAVE HAD TO EXERCISE INCREDIBLE FLEXIBILITY IN ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AS THEY EXPERIENCE STRESS. IN CRISIS THEY WERE DISCONNECTED THEN THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER HAVING BEEN DISCONNECTED. FOR MORE THAN A YEAR AND A HALF AS HUMANS WE ARE NOT. BE DISCONNECTION DOESN'T WORK SO WELL FOR US. IN WE'VE ALL BEEN IN CRISIS WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. BUT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCE IT ESPECIALLY VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE A SAFETY NET FOR HELPING TO CONNECT THEM. TO THE HELP THAT THEY NEED THERE'S ALSO A PROGRAM THAT OUR OFFICE ADMINISTERS IN A LOT OF- AGENCIES ADMINISTER. CALLED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID AWARENESS. IS ESSENTIALLY A WAY OF PROVIDING TRAINING. TO HELP PEOPLE IDENTIFY WHEN SOMEONE HAS A MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE FOR ALL. TO THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER A HOTLINE OR A WAY FOR SOMEONE. TO GET HELP WE DON'T EXPECT SCHOOLS TO REPLACE WHAT MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES OR SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES CAN DO. BUT OFTENTIMES OUR EDUCATORS ARE THE FIRST TO SEE WHEN SOMEONE IS IN NEED AND IF THEY DON'T SEE IT STUDENT SEES IT AND SO. WE PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL TRAINING THROUGH SCHOOLS THROUGH CLINICS. AND SO THESE PROGRAMS ARE I WOULD SAY ARE AMONG THE BEST- HEALTH CLINICS AND SCHOOLS. COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL- A MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID- IN. MENTAL HEALTH HERE- COUNSELORS ARE JUST TO NAME A FEW. I GET INTO A LOT OF TROUBLES LIKE SAID THAT THOSE WERE THEONLY ONES BUT THEY CERTAINLY. ARE AMONG SOME OF THE TOP ONES AND MOST OF ACTIVE- AND LYFT. THAT I JUST KNOW IT A COMMITTEES. TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW BEST PRACTICES AND WHERE WE SHOULD. BE FOCUSING RESOURCES WE DEFINITELY WANT TO FOCUS ON THOSE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE METRICS. AND HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT WE'RE EXPECTING FOR YOU. TO APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE QUESTION ABOUT METRICS CAME TO US DIRECTLY- IN A HEARING THAT WE ATTENDED NOT TOO LONG AGO. IN THIS HOUSE AND IT WAS AFTER THE BUDGET WAS ALLOCATED. AND ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES PUT THE QUESTION TO ME DIRECTLY. AND THEY SAID HOW YOU GONNA PROVIDE THE- PERSONNEL TO MEET THESE NEEDS. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT QUESTION THAT WE DUG AND DUG AND DUG TO THINK ABOUT A WAY TO. INCREASE THE RANKS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS BY TEN THOUSAND. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND FIGURE OUT A WAY- THAT'S HOW SB TWELVE TWENTY NINETEEN- TO THE FOR- WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS. UNLIKE ANYTHING HAPPENING IN ANY STATE I CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD. BUT HI SIR HI SUSPECTED EVERY STATE IS GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME CHALLENGES- AROUND THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES ARAMBULA OF CLINICIANS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MEMBER REVISED R. S. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE STATEMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM FROM LONG BEACH YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SPEND WE NEED TO ADD TO THE BASE. THAT CONCERNS ME A LITTLE BIT THAT WE'RE PUTTING TOO MUCH IN THESE KIND OF ORACLE BUCKETS THAT WE'RE NOT ALLOWING DISTRICTS TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED TO SPEND FLEXIBLY FLEXIBLY SO FOR WHAT MAKES SENSE IN THERE JUST BECAUSE EVERY COMMUNITY IS DIFFERENT. AND I ALSO REFLECT BACK OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND HOW HARD CODE HAS BEEN ON EVERYONE ON STUDENTS ON PARENTS ON TEACHERS ON PRINCIPLES ON SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. AND I ALSO REFLECT BACK TO MY MOM WHO WORKED FOR ALLEY UST FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS- SHE WAS A HEALTH CARE ASSISTANCE- AND NURSED- BUT YOU KNOW WHERE SHE GOT HER START AS A VOLUNTEER IN THE CLASSROOM SHE WAS A VOLUNTEER MY CLASSROOM AND NOT OPEN THE DOOR FOR HER TO WORK FOR A DISTRICT TO BE WITH HER KIDS DURING THEIR EDUCATION. AND WE KNOW THAT PARENTS OR KIDS IN THE CHILD'S FIRST EDUCATOR THE OTHER FOR OUR FIRST TEACHER AND I THINK COALBED. HAS REALLY REALLY. MADE PARENTS MORE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR CHILDREN. AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHETHER IT'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN DEVELOPING PROGRAMS IN. IN IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES THAT WE DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO EMPOWER. AND ENGAGE PARENTS TO BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS. PARENTS NEED THE TOOLS AND THE RESOURCES TO GET THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH. THE CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS NOT JUST IN THE CLASSROOM BUT AT HOME. I THINK THAT PARENTS ARE VERY TICKED OFF. I MEAN IT'S EVIDENT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION. WERE THREE MEMBERS WERE RECALL PARENTS WILL SHUT OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. AT THE TIME WERE IT'S MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER THAT THEY BE INVOLVED. SO JUST LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENGAGE PARENTS MORE THAN EVER. YOU KNOW AND THAT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE VOLUNTEERS PARENT VOLUNTEERS THAT WANT TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM. UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM. THE CLASSROOM WHERE THEIR KID IS THAT. SO WOULD LOVE TO JUST HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING TO ENGAGE PARENTS. I AGREE WITH THE THINGS THAT YOU SAID PARENTS ARE THE FIRST EDUCATORS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SCHOOLS CAN BE DIFFICULT PLACES- FOR PARENTS TO ENTER FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HELP TO ENTER. AND IT WAS DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT WE CREATED THE FIRST EVER FAMILY ENGAGEMENT UNIT. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DATA AROUND- MY FAMILY STRUGGLES- WE COULD SEE THAT MANY FAMILIES. RIGHT HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCES EVERY OTHER STUDENTS BECAUSE NOT EVERY FAMILY HAD ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. AND HAD ACCESS TO A COMPUTER AND SO WE CREATED A- TASK FORCE ON CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. THAT MANY LEGISLATORS IN THIS HOUSE SERVE ON THAT TASK FORCE AND HELPED US TO LITERALLY MOVE ILLIONS. OF PIECES OF EQUIPMENT TO FAMILIES TO ENSURE BUT ALSO PROVIDE TRAINING TO OUR FAMILIES TO PROVIDE. A TRAINING ON USING THE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING- MULTILINGUAL TRAINING- TO FOCUS ON OUR FAMILIES THAT SPEAK LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND- I AGREE WITH YOU AND WE BUILT THIS MODEST FAMILY ENGAGEMENT UNIT THAT'S DOING A GREAT DEAL. WE'VE LAID OUT A PATH THAT WE INTEND TO HOLD PARENT TOWN HALLS TO LISTEN TO PARENTS. YOU KNOW WHEN I TALK TO PARENTS THE FIRST THING I SAY TO THEM. IT'S THANK YOU. FOR STEPPING IN FOR THE HARD JOB- MANY OF YOUR PARENTS THANK YOU FOR THE HARD JOB. THE PARENTS HAD TO DO WHEN SCHOOLS WERE NOT OPEN IN PERSON- FOR INSTRUCTION- IN JUST RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY OF OUR FAMILIES. I CONTINUE TO FACE I NAY THE TASK FORCE TO WORK ON SOME STRATEGIES FOR MAKING SURE OUR CHILDREN LEARN TO READ. BY THIRD GRADE ONE OF THE FIRST GROUP SO WE INVITED TO BE A PART OF THAT WAS OUR STATE PTA- TO PARTNER WITH PARENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE- WE INTEND TO CONTINUE DOING THAT BUT WE CAN'T. WE DON'T HAVE A BIG DEPARTMENT AT THE STATE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT IS- SET UP TO DO THAT MOST OF OUR WORK IS SET UP BY A STATE AND FEDERAL GRANTS AND LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRE US TO. FOCUS ON VERY VERY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS NOT VERY PROUD OF THE STAFF DEPARTMENT OF IT. FOR THE A GREAT THEY DO. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO STRESS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP DISTRICTS DO A BETTER JOB OF PARTNERING. WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DONE IN BUILDING THIS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT UNIT. WE LIKE TO GROW MORE AND DO MORE WITH FAMILIES WE THINK THAT THEY ARE- IMPORTANT PARTNERS- IN THE IN THE EDUCATION OR CALIFORNIA. AND I WOULD JUST ADD AND ASK THAT YOU KNOW WE ALLOW PARENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND THAT WE DON'T MAKE IT SEEM EITHER TO DISTRICTS OR TO THE PUBLIC. I GET THE LIABILITY FOR PARENTS TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY'VE THEY FELT- THEY FELT LIKE THEY'VE BEEN SHUT OUT. SO IT'S GREAT TO HAVE PROGRAMS TO HAVE TOWN HALLS- BUT ALSO ENGAGING THEM TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM AND I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY AND IT'S A SACRIFICE FOR LOTS OF PARENTS. EIGHT I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHO THE NUMBER ONE PARENT IS THAT WANTS TO BE. IN THE CLASSROOM WITH THEIR CHILDREN. ENGLISH SPEAKING ARE THREE SPANISH SPEAKING LATINO WOMEN THEY WANT TO BE IN THE CLASSROOM. I JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR KIDS. AND AGAIN I JUST I JUST PUT A LOT OF. EMPHASIS ON LET'S OPEN THE DOORS FOR PARENTS LET'S ALLOW PARENTS TO HAVE. A LARGE SAY IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. LAST QUESTION THAT WE HAVE ON. WHAT YOU'RE A VIP PANELIST I WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD ONE PANELIST ONE HOUR WE HAVE FORTY SEVEN MORE PANELISTS. SUGGESTED PUT EVERYBODY IN BIG PERSPECTIVE I SEE THE REST OF MY TIME TO THE FORTY SO JUST. HI DUTCH'S FORTY SEVEN PANELISTS JUST FOR THE RECORD. ONE QUESTION IS- AS FAR AS WE HAVE ALLOCATE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS FOR SERVICE YOU TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL. WHAT ARE HEARING OUT THERE AS FAR AS HIRING PEOPLE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY SAY IT'S LIMITED TERM HABIT PURSES CONTRACTING WOULD LIKE HEALTH PLANS AND OTHER GROUPS THAT ALREADY HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO UTILIZE THEM THE HEARING THAT THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET ABOUT THE MOST AMOUNT OF- PRODUCTIVITY IN THE SHORT TERM FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING SPECIFIC AT THIS TIME THAT I CAN POINT TO- I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT AND GET BACK TO YOU BUT- YOU KNOW FROM MY STANDPOINT THE WAY AS IT RELATES TO MENTAL HEALTH THE WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS WORK. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MORE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO WORK IN SCHOOLS FOR THE REASON THAT MISSISSIPPI ARE TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE ARE MORE- SCHOOL CYCLE SOCIAL WORKERS WHO WORK IN SCHOOL- BUT THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY HAS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP. WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO- BRING CLINICIANS- TO THE WORK THERE JUST AREN'T ENOUGH CANDIDATES TO DO THE WORK IF WE DON'T PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT'S NOT A CONTRACTING OUT STATEMENT OR DOING IN AND AROUND STATEMENT I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS WE HAVE TO HAVE CREDENTIAL PEOPLE. AS I POINTED OUT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SHORT CUTS ARE FOR THESE CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO REDUCE THE QUALITY CARE THAT WILL BE DELIVERED- WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING WE NEED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT AND IN ORDER TO REQUEST INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT'S NEEDED TO MEET THE NEEDS. TO GO FROM 30% OF WHAT MIGHT BE THE CURRENT NEED TO MEETING THE EXISTING NEED WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S A COMBINATION OF SCHOOL BASED STAFF AS WELL AS- PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M- A BACKUP. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. DECEMBER MEMBER SALAS. HI THANK YOU SOMEONE POLITICS GIVE ME I'M START MISTER THURMAN I FOR TO RECOGNIZE OUR MAJORITY LEADER WHO HAD HAD SOME FINAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU SIR I SEE MY TIME TO THE MAJORITY LEADER.

I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE BILL ONLY BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT IT YOU KNOW I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF MY CAREER WORKING WITH YOUNG ADULTS TRANSITIONING OUT OF FOSTER CARE. AND IN OFTEN IS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO SUPPORT THEM I THINK THAT'S A- I MEAN IT'S A WONDERFUL GROW YOUR OWN CONCEPT THAT YOU'VE ARTICULATED.

ARE STATUTORY CHARGE ISTO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN ZERO FIVE IN FOUR. DIFFERENT AREAS ONE ENSURING THAT CHILDREN LEARN AND ARE READY FOR SCHOOL. TO HELP YOU DEVELOPMENT THREE BUILDING STRONG FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND FOR CREATING BETTER SYSTEMS. TO HELP CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SIXTEEN ANTI. I ALSO COMES YOU AS TRAIN SOCIAL OKAY EXPERIENCE A FIVE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES- A SCHOOL MORE MY WHO HAS ADVOCATE TO ENTER BEHAVIOR AND MENTAL. SERVICES AND INTERVENTION INTO EDUCATION SECONDS. ANONYMOUS MORE PERSONAL LEVEL HI MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDREN ARE CONSIDERED CONSUMERS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM EMBARRASSED SETTINGS AND VALUE THE OPPORTUNITYTO EXPAND. THE CONTINUUM OF SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE TO ALL FAMILIES. THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF INFANTS AND TODDLERS. IS MORE RAPID AND FOUNDATIONAL THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER AGE GROUPS. BABIES EARLIEST RELATIONSHIPS AND EXPERIENCES SHAPE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE BRAIN CREATING A FOUNDATION ON WHICH FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING UNFOLDS. AS THEY MATURE THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUPPORTS GROWTH AND WELL BEING AND OTHER ESSENTIAL AREAS. THESE INCLUDE PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT COGNITIVE SKILLS LANGUAGE AND LITERACY SOCIAL SKILLS AND EVEN THEIR APPROACH TO LEARNING AND READINESS FOR SCHOOL. WHEN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD IS COMPROMISE SO TOO IS THE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS. THESE OTHER AREAS LEAVING CHILDREN MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POOR OVERALL HEALTH. OR EDUCATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND EVEN EVEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIFE. REMOTING THE- HEALTH AND YOUNG CHILDREN SHOULD UNDERSCORED AS AN ASIDE. IN FOR FUTURE. ALL POSITIVE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES PROMOTE STRONG BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT WITH SERIOUS LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES. WHEN AN INFANT OR YOUNG CHILD BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DETERIORATES SIGNIFICANTLY. THEY CAN AND THEY DO EXPERIENCE RESILIENCE ISSUE IMPACT APPROXIMATELY 9014% OF CHILDREN. BIRTH TO AGE IS FIVE EXPERIENCE EMOTIONAL RELATIONAL OR- DISTURBANCE. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AFFECTING FAMILIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN. AT THEIR MOST FRAGILE MOMENTS. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE UNDER SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL STRESS BOTH FROM THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND OTHER UNDERLYING AND SYSTEM ISSUES OF POVERTY RACISM AND TRUMP. AND THE DATA INDICATES THAT LEFT UNTREATED THIS WILL BE TO CORPS CHRONIC HEALTH AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES. M. MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA CHAIR DR NADINE BURKE HARRIS'S ROADMAP TO RESILIENCE PROVIDES US WITH A FRAMEWORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF YOUNG CHILDREN THAT IS ROOTED IN THE SCIENCE OF IMPORTANCE OF RELATIONAL HEALTH. CARE GIVERS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE EPIGENETICS OF TOXIC STRESS THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THE GREAT NEED IN FRONT OF US. WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ALREADY OPERATING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT WE CAN BUILD ON THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN LIMITED BY LACK OF RESOURCES LACK OF WORKFORCE AND LACK OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND POLITICAL WILL. WHAT I HOPE TO LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY IS THAT THIS IS BIGGER THAN ANY ONE PROPOSAL WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT TO PLACE. TO EMPLOYEES TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND FAMILIESAND SEE THEM THROUGH THIS MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND ANY MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT COME OUR WAY. NOW IS THE TIME TO COMMIT MORE RESOURCES TO THE SERVICES THAT SUPPORT PARENTS. AND YOUNG CHILDREN AND CAREGIVERS AND THE SYSTEMS THAT MAKE THOSE SERVICES POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THIS PANEL R ANIMALS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE YOU. HAPPY CALL THE FRIEND THROUGHOUT A LIFELINE. GREAT THANK YOU- THIS ONE WAS WE WANT TO MARRY ENHANCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR FIRST FIVE HUMBOLDT COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOUR COMMITTEES TODAY- AGAIN MY NAME IS MARIANNE HANSEN. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FIRST FIVE HUMBOLDT I ALSO TEACH COURSES THAT CAL POLY HUMBOLDT IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CO CHAIRED THE CALIFORNIA SURGEON GENERAL'S RECENT NETWORK OF CARE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA AND TOXIC STRESS. ON VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXIC STRESS IMPACT THE VERY ARCHITECTURE OF A CHILD'S DEVELOPING BRING. IT IN THE WAY THAT THE DEVELOPING BRAIN PERFECTLY ADAPTS TO ITS EXPERIENCES STRESS CAN SHAPE THE BRAIN TO BE MORE REACTIVE MORE PRIME TO PERCEIVED THREAT AND ALTER THE BODY'S LIFELONG NETWORKS RESPONSE NETWORKS. IN FACT ADULTS WHO EXPERIENCE TRAUMA BEFORE AGE FIVE DEMONSTRATED ADULT DEPRESSION AND PTSD SYMPTOM SCORES THEY'RE ALMOST TWICE AS HIGH AS THOSE EXPOSED TO TRAUMA DURING EARLY AND MIDDLE CHILDHOOD. AND ADOLESCENCE. THE DEVELOPMENTAL TIMING MAKES A DIFFERENCE IMPACTS ARE ESPECIALLY DEEPER CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE RACISM AND LIVE IN NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH RATES OF FAMILY STRESS AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE. MANY OF THESE CHILDREN REQUIRE CLINICAL SERVICES BUT THIS YEAR TO FIVE AGE RANGE OFFERS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR PREVENTION FOR PRE CLINICAL SERVICES. FOR INCREASING THE BUFFERING INFLUENCES THAT CAN BUILD A LIFETIME OF IMPROVED HEALTH AND CAN HELP CHILDREN BE MORE SUCCESSFUL ONCE THEY REACH SCHOOL. COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS PLAY A CLIP CRITICAL ROLE IN PREVENTION. CARE AND SUPPORT ARE DELIVERED IN SPACE SAYS THAT CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES ALREADY FREQUENT ALARM ALLOW FAMILIES TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE DISTINCT FROM CLINICAL SERVICES SUCH AS THE NEW DATA CARE MEDICAL BENEFIT WHICH IN ADDITION TO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. SERVICES AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL MIGHT LOOK LIKE FACILITATED PLAYGROUPS PARENTING SUPPORT CLASSES. OR MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVIDERS AMONG OTHERS. AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY FIRST FIVE HUMBOLDT SUPPORTS EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO TRAVEL TO TWENTY PLAYERS ACROSS OUR RURAL COUNTING ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND THESE PLAYERS ARE HOSTED BY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENT LEADERSHIP REDUCE SOCIAL ISOLATION. THESE SPECIALISTS ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT BEHAVIOR. THEY CONDUCTED ELEMENTAL SCREENINGS. CONNECT FAMILIES WITH RESOURCES. AIRONET AND MORE INTENSE SUPPORT WHEN NEEDED THOSE SERVICES HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWN STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE OUTCOMES. THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP FAMILIES OVERCOME BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND PROVIDE SERVICES AND ACCESSIBLE SETTINGS THAT ARE MATCHED TO LOCAL CONTEXT LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO REACH FAMILIES FROM HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES INCLUDING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES OF COLOR. THESE PROGRAMS ARE UNDER FUNDED AND IN NEED OF INVESTMENT. IN HUMBLE WE'VE HAD TO DISCONTINUE SOME EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION SERVICES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CONSISTENT FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME EXPENSE SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT MIGHT RELIEVE SME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM AND SOME POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS TO THIS CRITICAL AREAS NEED. LIKE JACKING I'M ALSO- AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. YEAH THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY LET'S GO TO MOVE ON TO ANGELA VASQUEZ POLICY DIRECTOR FOR MENTAL HEALTH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP. RIGHT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS THAT THANK YOU CHAIRS ARAMBULA- MCCARTY AND SALAS FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO EXPLORING THESE ISSUES TODAY. I AM ANGELA VASQUEZ AT THE POLICY DIRECTOR OVER MENTAL HEALTH AT THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP. AS YOU'VE HEARD CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WERE EXPERIENCING ALARMING LEVELS OF STRESS EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THIS TREND WAS WELL DOCUMENTED AND APPROPRIATELY LABELED A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS BY THE STATE'S FIRST SURGEON GENERAL AND OUR GOVERNOR. THE CONDITIONS CREATED BY THE PANDEMIC SUCH AS INCREASED ISOLATION ECONOMIC STRESS AND COMMUNITY TRAUMA EXACERBATED THE ONGOING NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OR ACES ON YOUNG CHILDREN MANY OF WHOM EXPERIENCED HIGHLY VERY VARIABLE AND LIKELY STRESSFUL DAYTIME CARE SITUATIONS ABDIN FLOWED WITH PANDEMIC SURGES AND CHAOTIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FOR FAMILIES. THIS PAST FALL THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP AND THE FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION TOGETHER WITH THE FIRST FIVE CENTER FOR CHILDREN'S POLICY RELEASED A REPORT ADDRESSING AND BEEN AN EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OPPORTUNITY FOR COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE HISTORICAL AND STILL ESCALATING MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COMMUNITY LEVEL PROGRAMS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO CREATE LONG LASTING CHANGE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL UNLIKE OLDER CHILDREN AND YOUTH INFANTS AND TODDLERS ARE UNIQUELY DEPENDENT ON THEIR CAREGIVERS TO HAVE THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS MET. PROGRAMS SUCH AS AND THEN AN EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS POSITIVE PARENTING PROGRAM OR TRIPLE PEAKS AND THE INCREDIBLE YEARS AMONG OTHERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT A CHILD'S EARLY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES. IN A WAY THAT IS CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE ADAPTABLE TO COMMUNITY SETTINGS OUTSIDE OF A CLINIC OR DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND THEREFORE LESS STIGMATIZED AND ACCESSIBLE TO FAMILIES OF BLACK AND BROWN CHILDREN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND LOW INCOME AND RURAL FAMILIES WHO HISTORICALLY LACK ACCESS TO ADEQUATE AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE. DESPITE THE GROWING EVIDENCE BASE FOR THESE AND OTHER PRO AND PER POP CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND PREVENTING FUTURE POOR MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. OUR RESEARCH ALSO SHOWED THAT THERE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL LACK OF RESOURCES DEDICATED TO THESE TYPES OF TRUE UPSTREAM PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AS- A LACK OF APPROPRIATE CLINICAL AND NON CLINICAL WORK FORCE. AND A LACK OF PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING AND POLITICAL WILL TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF VERY YOUNG CHILDREN WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF URGENCY AS WE ARE NOW ADDRESSING THE SUICIDE CRISIS AN OLDER YEAR. NEW STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING IN RESPONSE IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. BUT MORE MUST BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE INVESTMENTS REACH ARE YOUNGEST CHILDREN IN COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS. THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WAS APPROVED TO ADDRESS THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AGES ZERO TO FIVE YET THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING IS EXPLICITLY DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND SCHOOLS. CHAIR ARAMBULA EARLIER ASKED SUPERINTENDENT BERMAN ABOUT HOW TO MEET THE URGENT NEEDS OF CHILDREN THROWN INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO BUILD COLLABORATIVE SYSTEM. OVER FIVE YEARS TO THAT END I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE PROGRAMS ADVOCATES HERE HAVE IDENTIFIED IT IDENTIFIED TO SUPPORT INCIDENT EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY ARE SHOVEL READY FOR INVESTMENT. WITH MANY AS YOU HEARD EARLIER AT RISK OF AT IMMINENT RISK OF STOPPING SERVICES DUE TO LIMITED AND SHRINKING PUBLIC FUNDING. WHILE WE APPLAUD THE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND BRINGING CARE TO OUR CHILDREN ARE IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO DEDICATED FUNDS WITHIN THE INITIATIVE TO BRING CARE TO WEAR VERY YOUNG CHILDREN ARE. IN THE HOME AND IN CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL SETTINGS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THE INITIATIVE TO EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED GAPS AND FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. WORKFORCE AND PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF INFINITE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH. WITH A DEDICATED INVESTMENT AN INFANT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD MANY MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY PROGRAMS WE CAN MOVE THE STATE TOWARD FULLY MEETING THE MOMENT THAT THE CHILDREN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS PRESENTS. AND FOR A LITTLE CAL. LEADERSHIP AND MOVING OUR SYSTEMS OF CARE TOWARD TRUE UPSTREAM PREVENTION AND A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO CHILD AND YOUTH WELL BEING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY LET'S MOVE ON TO- MARNIE'S ON THE WORLD DEPUTY DIRECTOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SERVICES WITH THE MONTEREY COUNTY OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT.

MY ART OCTOBER IN THE EVENINGS ARE DEPENDENT ON THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES TO CARE AND PROVIDE FOR THEIR NEEDS GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT THESE EARLY ATTACHMENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INFANTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE SO CRITICAL. REMEMBER SO IT CAN SOMETIMES BE CHALLENGING. ENGLISH EXPECTED VARIATIONS AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRESS FROM A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION AND A PANDEMIC HAS REALLY ONLY EXACERBATED THESE CHALLENGES FOR FAMILIES. WE DO KNOW THAT EARLY TRAUMA AND UNHEALTHY PARENT INFANT ATTACHMENT PATTERNS NEGATIVELY IMPACT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND THAT SETS THE STAGE FOR MALADAPTIVE INFANT AND ADULT MENTAL HEALTH. IT ACCENT THROUGHOUT. SO PREVENT AND EARLY INTERVENTION ARE KEY TO REDUCING LONG TERM AND MORE SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH DIFFICULTIES MANY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS ALREADY SERVE YOUNG CHILDREN THREE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS I'M IN MONTEREY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAS A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL FIRST FIVE. CHANGE IT WE NEED THE FULL ARRAY OF SUPPORTS THAT BENEFIT YOUNG CHILDREN IN CARE GIVERS FOR EXAMPLE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. THIRTY COUNTY FIRST FIVE HAS BEEN PROVIDING INFANT FAMILY EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT SPECIFICALLY OFFERS TRAINING AND BUILD EXPERTISE ACROSS SYSTEMS SERVING CHILDREN PRENATAL THROUGH AGE FIVE AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE ARE ACTIVELY BUILDING EARLY CHILDHOOD WORKFORCE IN OUR COUNTY THROUGH EXPERTISE TRAINING. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS ALSO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD AND CHILD WELFARE COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO INTEGRATE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE IN MARIN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE HAVE THE MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM THAT IS CO LOCATED PHYSICALLY WITH CHILD WELFARE TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THAT COME TO THE ATTENTION OF CHILD WELFARE. THEY'RE ALSO EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE FOR OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES ACROSS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WERE USING STRATEGIES THAT ARE BOTH EVIDENCE BASED AND EVIDENCE INFORMED SUCH AS- PARENT CHILD INTERACTION THERAPY. TERRAPLANE CHILD PARENT PSYCHOTHERAPY CIRCLE OF SECURITY ATTACHMENT FOCUSED FAMILY THERAPY AND DYADIC DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOTHERAPY THESE MODELS WE HAVE SEEN TO BE TRULY EFFECTIVE IN SUPPORTING THE FAMILIES THAT WERE TRYING TO HELP. THAT CRITICAL INTEGRATION OF MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH INTO SERVICES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN IS ALSO INCREDIBLY NECESSARY FOR SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT OUTCOMES. MONTEREY COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CO CHAIRS THE LOCAL MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE THE PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND AWARENESS EVENTS. AND WE DEVELOP INTEGRATION OF MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT INTO OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES TREATMENT PROGRAM. UNDER CALAMP CBH THE A REQUESTED CHANGES TO ENSURE CHILDREN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND ALL CHILD WELFARE INVOLVED CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SPECIALTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE MEDIC HOW FUNDING FOR SERVICES PRE DIAGNOSIS. ALLOWING FOR EXPANDED FEDERAL MEDICAID INTO COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR SERVICES. IN ADDITION COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO UTILIZE 15220% OF AN HSA FUNDING FOR CRITICAL PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES ARE NOT REIMBURSABLE YOUR INSURANCE. FOR EXAMPLE PRESCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND SUPPORT ANOTHER SUFFERING FROM POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION OR PSYCHOSIS ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE HERE IN MONTEREY COUNTY AS PART OF THAT FUNDING. I ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS EMPHASIS ON CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS. THESE CHILDREN ARE OFTEN SIR THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND WHEN A CHILD HAS BOTH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. AN INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY THIS CAN PLACE AN EXTREME THE LADY. WILDCATS COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STATEWIDE DOES WORK TO PARTNER WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE CHILDREN THE SERVICE IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS SPECIAL POPULATION ARE LACKING STATE WIDE. AND GREATER INTER AGENCY COORDINATION IS NEEDED AT THE STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL. AND ALSO WANT TO REALLY APPRECIATE THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN HAD ON WORK FORCE TODAY. B. AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE ALSO OF COURSE EXPERIENCING EXTREME WORKFORCE CRISIS. AS THE PANDEMIC AND ASSOCIATED ECONOMIC STRESSORS HAVE CREATED AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR OUR WORK FORCE. AS A RESULT THE LIMITED NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS WILL BE SOUGHT TO BUILD A GREATER NUMBER OF POSITIONS SO THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WORKFORCE NEEDS FROM LICENSE SPECIALISTS A VERY IMPORTANT PARTNERS. ON I APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE IS UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH. THE WORLD IS A CHALLENGING PLACE AND OUR CHILDREN NEED THE OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT TO BUILD RESILIENCE WE MUST INVEST IN MENTAL HEALTH. FOR THE WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TESTIMONY LET'S MOVE ON TO- MARYLAND ALL VERY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED. GOOD AFTERNOON I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MADE IN A RECORDING. AND I HAVE BEEN A FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDER IN CHULA VISTA CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS SOMETHING THAT IS TOO OFTEN OVERLOOKED WHEN WE DISCUSS THE NEEDS OF FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. IN THE CHILDREN UNDER OUR CARE. HEALTH CARE. THERE ARE MANY REASONS WE DON'T DISCUSS IT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT. AND THERE IS SO MUCH REFINING FOR TO WIN THE DIGNITY AND RESPECT WITH THE SERVER. BUT MENTAL HEALTH IS EVERY BIT AS IMPORTANT AS PHYSICAL HEALTH AS LIVABLE WAGES AS ACCESS TO OTHER KINDS OF RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS. WE WORK FOR LOW WAGES AND LONG HOURS IN A PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY DEMANDING JOB. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME RUNNING THEIR OWN BUSINESS BEINART EMPLOYEES PAYING OUR BILLS MAKING SURE EACH AND EVERY CHILD IN OUR CARE HAS EVERYTHING THEY NEED. TO GROW AND SUCCEED. ALL WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE CARE IN MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS WE NEED. BUT IT IS PROVIDERS WHO STRUGGLING NEED HELP. THE CHILDREN IN OUR CARE NEED HELP TO. FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS HAVE LONG KEEP THE FAMILIES WE CARE FOR. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE STILL PROBABLY ACCEPTS THAT SUBSIDY CHILDREN INTO OUR CARE. BUT EING LOW INCOME OFTEN COMES WITH A LACK OF ACCESS TO BASIC MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES. FOUR MONTHS LONG WAITS FOR NEEDED SERVICES IN COLBY HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THIS PROBLEM. I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT COLD IT HAS HAD ON OUR CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH FIRSTHAND. ANY SENSE OF NORMALCY THEY ONCE HAD IS GONE THEY'RE VISIBLY STRESSED IN SOMEWHERE STRUGGLING WITH BASIC SKILLS. THEIR PARENTS OFTEN DON'T HAVE THE SAME SUPPORT NETWORKS TO RELY ON BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN AND TO THRIVE. AS PROVIDERS WE NEED RESOURCES AND TRAINING ON MENTAL HEALTH TO HELP IDENTIFY WHEN CHILDREN IN OUR CARE STRUGGLING. AND HOW TO ADDRESS THAT AND HOW TO HELP THEM. YOU CAN POUR OUT OF AN EMPTY CUP. SO PROVIDERS NEED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR OURSELVES TO. INDEED CAN HAPPEN AS LONG AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO STONE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR FAMILY CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. WE ALREADY RAISED FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH EVERY DAY. WE'RE WORKING WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE OFTEN TOO YOUNG TO WEAR A FACEMASK. OFTEN TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED. THESE LITTLE ONES IN UNDERSTAND SOCIAL DISTANCING AND THEY NEED CLOSE CONTACT. NO MATTER THEIR RACE THROWN HEALTH. 25% OF US HAVE NO ACCESS TO INSURANCE. IN MANY WHO DO CANNOT AFFORD TO USE IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE CARE. SO WE'RE FORCED TO PUT OUR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ON THE BACK BURNER ALL WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE FORCED TO CLOSE BECAUSE OUR BODIES CANNOT PHYSICALLY DO THE WORK ANYMORE AND WE CANNOT SEEK OUT THE TREATMENT WE NEED. HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE FORCED TO CLOSE BECAUSE THIS TRAIN THE JOB PUTS ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH ISN'T SUSTAINABLE. WE'RE LOSING PROVIDERS AND WE'RE PUTTING COUNTLESS ALL THERE IS TO UNDO STRESS WHEN WE HAVE SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS. BUT THE STATE IS UNWILLING TO ACT. WE NEED AFFORDABLE CARE OPTIONS IN WE NEED THEM NOW. WHEN THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HIT OUR STATE WE WERE CALLED FRONTLINE HEROES ANYTHING SHORT WORK GRIEF AS WE STAYED OPEN AT A RESTORE ON HEALTH TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE SAME DOCTORS AND NURSES WE CANNOT AFFORD TO VISIT. IT'S TIME TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT YOU GIVE US IN THE MEDIA. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO STEP UP IN PROVIDERS WITH THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO CONTINUE PROVIDING OUR ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY RUNNING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK FOR TESTIMONY LET'S MOVE ON TO- DONNA'S STARING- CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I AM DONIS NARINDER AND THE CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER WITH THE CHILD CARE RESOURCE CENTER WE'RE A NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. OUR CORE SERVICES INCLUDE- WORK AROUND CHILD CARE RESOURCE AND REFERRAL SERVICES SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS I WE ARE A FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER WE RUN HEAD START PROGRAMS AND WE OFFER HOME VISITING SERVICES. SINCE THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES AND OUR WORK WITH HEAD START WE HAVE OFFERED MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND SUPPORT AS IT IS PART OF THE HEAD START DESIGN- WITH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR MANY MANY DECADES THE BENEFITS OF HAVING ON SITE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND SUPPORT. FOR PROVIDERS AND FOR THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE AS WELL AS FOR THE FAMILIES AS WE WORK. TO DO TRUE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION- WITH MANY MANY CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC REALLY JUST EXACERBATED A LOT OF COMMUNITY STRESSORS THAT WE WERE ALREADY SEEING AND I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ECHO MIRREN'S COMMENTS ABOUT THE STRESS THAT WE'VE PLACED ON OUR CHILD CARE COMMUNITY. AND ON THE CHILDREN WHO WERE GOING TO CHILD CARE THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC WELL SCHOOLS HAVE REOPENED CHILD CARE REMAINED OPEN AND AT RISK TO THEIRHEALTH AT RISK TO THE HEALTH OF THEIR OWN FAMILIES AND OFTEN AT RISK TO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. THIS BROUGHT ADDITIONAL STRESSORS ALONG WITH MANY OF THE OTHER FACTORS THAT SUPERINTENDENT BERMAN RAISED EARLIER. BECAUSE OF THIS OUR AGENCY DECIDED TO SELF FUND A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR MENTAL HEALTH WITH OUR COMMUNITY BASED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WE BEGAN THIS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO- BUILDING OUT ON THE MODEL WE CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED ARE HEAD START PRO. TO WORK OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS LARGELY WITH FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO REALLY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THEM AND WORK ALONGSIDE THEM ON SKILLS AND STRATEGIES TO ALLOW THEM TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE ALL THE DIFFERENT NEEDS. AND HELP THEM THROUGH THE DIFFERENT PROCESS SEES OF COMMUNICATION WITH FAMILY AND SETTING UP AN ENVIRONMENT THAT. IS SUPPORTIVE TO ALL THE CHILDREN AND ASSISTS IN KEEPING CHILDREN IN CARE. THIS HAS BEEN AN EFFORT WE HAVE BEEN VERY COMMITTED TO IS AN ORGANIZATION HOWEVER WE ARE FINDING THIS OUT OF. DOLLARS THAT WE'VE RAISED- AND IT ISN'T SUSTAINABLE SO WE REALLY ARE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEED OF- A DESIGNATED PROGRAM FUNDING FOR CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE AS PART OF THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH INITIATIVE. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE OFFER THE SERVICES AT CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AS A TRUE PREVENTION SERVICE TO REALLY HELP SUPPORT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THROUGH THE STRESSORS WE'VE ALL BEEN EXPERIENCING AND TO HELP THEM SUCCESSFULLY GROW AND DEVELOP AS THEY'RE ENTERING THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. IN ADDITION WE REALLY ENCOURAGE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT SUPPORTING BIRTH THROUGH FIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT DOLLARS ARE INVESTED IN TREATMENT SO THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE IDENTIFIED WHO MAY HAVE ISSUES THAT ARE MORE PROFOUND. THAN THEIR CHILD CARE PROVIDER PARENT CAN MANAGE THERE ARE AFFECTED PLACES TO REFER TO THEM SO THEY CAN GET THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. WE REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE AND TO SUPPORTING OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AS WE TRIED TO MOVE OUT OF PANDEMIC INTO ENDEMIC. AND BIG BRING SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY BACK TO FOLKS LIVES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO- TINA SLOAN VICE PRESIDENT EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND TRAINING WITH THE DONALD. GOOD AFTERNOON I AM TINA SLOAN A LICENSED THERAPIST AND VICE PRESIDENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AT CONTANGO THE LARGEST CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDER IN THE BAY AREA. I OVERSEE A MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION TEAM OF TWENTY FIVE SERVING OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY CLASSROOMS. THE FIRST FIVE YEARS AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD IS A COMPLEX AND HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE PERIOD. THE MOST PIVOTAL FOR ALL HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THE GLOBAL ADVERSITY OF THE PAST FEW YEARS ONLY COMPOUNDS THE VULNERABILITY OF OUR YOUNG CHILDREN PUTTING THEM AT EVEN GREATER DELIRIOUS RISK. IT'S ALSO WARNED HONOR EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICAL FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THERAPEUTIC SUPPORT AND CARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN MUST NOT OCCUR IN A WEEKLY THERAPY SESSION ALONE BUT ALSO AT HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITY WITHIN EACH ADULT ENCOUNTER. ANYONE COULD BE THERAPEUTIC IN THE LIFE OF A CHILD OPTIMALLY A YOUNG CHILD IS ALWAYS BEING LOOKED AFTER BY AN ADULT REGARDLESS OF THE SETTING WHO UNDERSTANDS AND SUPPORTS ALL OF THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS. BUFFERS NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AND CONTRIBUTES POSITIVELY AND HEALTHILY TO THEIR WELL BEING THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES TO SHAPE A CHILD TO BE HEALTHY RESILIENT AND PREPARED FOR LIFE. LEARNING CARE ENVIRONMENTS THUS ARE CRUCIAL HUBS OF BUFFERING CARE FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS. THESE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR EDUCATORS HAVE AN UNEQUIVOCAL INFLUENCE ON THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL OF THE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE. QUALITY EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION IS KEY ANY CLIPPING AND SUPPORTING ADMINISTRATORS EARLY EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS TO FIRST BE WELL THEMSELVES. WHILE THEY HAVE A TRANSFORMATIVE THERAPEUTIC IMPACT ON CHILDREN. WITHOUT CONSULTATION PROGRAMS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PROLIFERATING OVERWHELMED EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL FATIGUE AND BURNOUT AND PLACID BIAS AND IN ADEQUATE SUPPORT OR INTERVENTIONS. EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION IS THE ONLY PROVEN MENTAL HEALTH BACK PRACTICE WITHIN ECP THAT IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE COMPLEX INTERRELATED INFLUENCES OF PROGRAM TEACHER CHILD AND FAMILY. THERE IS A FORMULA TO QUALITY EFFECTIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION IT'S ROOTED IN CURRENT SCIENCE ISN'T MENTAL HEALTH ORIENTED YET INCLUSIVE OF A MULTI DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE. IT IS A PROACTIVE AND PREVENTION DRIVEN YET SIMULTANEOUSLY DELIVERS A MULTI TARGETED WHOLE SYSTEM WHOLE PERSON APPROACH PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON THE ADULTS ADMINISTRATORS EDUCATORS AND FAMILIES. IT HOLISTICALLY ADDRESSES THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE ENVIRONMENT AS A WHOLE STAFF IN ALL CHILDREN IN THE CITING WITHOUT ANY KIND OF ELIGIBILITY CONSTRAINTS. IT DELIVER SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTINUOUS INTERVENTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS ACROSS THE PROGRAM CLASSROOM RIDE WIDE HOME AND FOR SPECIFIC CRISES AND OTHER SPECIFIC SITUATIONS IT ALSO CREATES TIME AND FILLED WITH FACILITATES A PROCESS THAT ADDRESSES COMPLEX ISSUES GENERATES TAILORED RESPONSES TO THESE COMPLEX ISSUES. UNCOVERED IN EQUITABLE TREATMENT DISRUPTS HARMFUL PRACTICES ADDRESSES INTOLERABLE WORKING CONDITIONS AND INSTEAD PROPELS THE CREATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTING PRACTICES THAT BENEFITS ALL. THIS FORMULA REQUIRES THE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE UNIQUELY SKILLED DIVERSE AND AN ADEQUATELY FUNDED CONSULTANT WORK FORCE QUALITY PROFESSIONAL TRAINING AND SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS ON DEEP UNDER PAN A CONSULTANT AFFECTED NESS AND DRIVE THE TRANSFORMATIONAL IMPACT CONSUL CAN HAVE ACROSS THE SIDING FOR TEACHERS FOR CHILDREN AND FOR FAMILIES. WITH ITS CONSULTATION OF APPROACH AND SPECIALIZED EXPERT WORK FORCE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION ENABLES THE E. C. E. SYSTEM TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF EDUCATORS FAMILIES AND CHILDREN DISRUPTS BIAS AND DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND MORE FULLY PROPELS ALL CHILDREN EQUITABLY. TOWARDS THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO- KM JACKSON FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE BLACK MAN FOR EDUCATION EQUITY. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE ASSEMBLY LEADERS AND STAFF MY NAME IS TIENE JACKSON REPRESENTING BLACK MEN FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY BM E. BM E. AS A VOLUNTEER GROUP OF UNAFFILIATED BLACK AND AFRICAN AMERICAN FATHERS UNCLES BROTHERS SONS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH A FOCUS ON CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. BY SYSTEM BIASES AND RACISM. LET ME FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE WITH THE BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT THAT WAS SET BY OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND PANELISTS ONE THESE ISSUES THAT WILL BE DISCUSSING TODAY AND HOW IT IMPACTS OUR BABIES. FOR MANY DECADES WE HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE OVER EXPOSURE OF BLACK CHILDREN TO EXCLUSIONARY DISCIPLINE. WHILE MANY POLICIES IN PRACTICE BASED INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN RECENT YEARS THE ISPROPORTIONATE ALITY BETWEEN BLACK CHILDREN AND CHILDREN OF COLOR ARE STILL PRESENT. SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS OF BLACK CHILDREN ARE EVIDENT AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION HOWEVER THE MOST EGREGIOUS IS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND EARLY LEARNING SPACES. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR BABIES. THIS IS A MORAL ISSUE. IF WE DAMAGE THESE YOUNG MINDS EARLY THAN WE ARE SETTING THE CONDITIONS FOR THEM TO GET THE OUTCOMES WE'RE SAYING IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEMS SUCH AS ACHIEVEMENT GAPS LOW TEST SCORES LOW SELF ESTEEM LOW EXPECTATIONS THIS CONNECTEDNESS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. AND DISPROPORTIONATE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION RATES ALL THAT SUBSTANTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PRESCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE ON RAMPS. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THEN THE QUESTION BY NECESSITY HAS TO BE CALM IF WE'RE DOING DAMAGE TO OUR CHILDREN HOW DO WE HELP HEAL. THAT'S WHERE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS COME INTO PLAY AS WE HAVE JUST HEARD ABOUT FROM DOCTOR TINA SLOAN. WE AT BME ARE HOLDING OURSELVES TO ACCOUNT AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT TOUCHES THE BABIES WITHIN OUR EDUCATION IN EASY E. SYSTEMS. ARE CHILDREN AND BABIES. DESERVE BETTER. I ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELVES IN THE SHOES OF A PARENT OR GUARDIAN OF ONE OF THESE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE EXPELLED OR SUSPENDED FROM EARLY LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS. NONE OF US CAN SAY. THAT WE CAN SUSPEND OR EXPEL MY CHILD. IN DAMAGE THEM. AND THEY'RE NOT HELP THEM TO RESTORE AND HEAL. WE SIMPLY CANNOT DO IT. AND WE CANNOT SEPARATE THE DISPROPORTION ALITY RATES OF EXPULSION FROM THE CHILD THERE'S A FACE THERE THERE'S A BODY THERE. WITH THAT WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AN EDUCATIONAL CULTURE AND CLIMATE THAT TREATS CHILDREN THIS WAY IS OBVIOUSLY NOT A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT FOR BABIES. AND OUR CHILDREN. EDUCATORS AND PROVIDERS NEED SUPPORTS AND OUR CHILDREN NEED US MORE. MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. BME IS ASKING YOU. IN AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT TO MOVE URGENTLY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS TO OUR CHILDREN AND THOSE THAT EDUCATE AND TAKE CARE OF THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S MOVE ON TO READ THE NAME GAS SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE MONTEREY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY I'M DOCTOR DENNING GUS MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND IN MY ROLE I WORK WITH TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN EIGHT CHARTER SCHOOLS SERVING SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS. I AM A MOTHER A FORMER TEACHER THE FORMER SITE IN DISTRICT ADMINISTRATOR AND I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES FROM BIRTH. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE SEE EACH AND EVERY CHILD FROM THE WHOLE CHILD PERSPECTIVE AND WE SEE HOW STUDENTS CAN BE MUCH MORE SUPPORTED AND SUCCESSFUL WHEN WE INVEST EARLY. YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERS THAT THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SCIENCE IS CLEAR INVESTING IN BABIES TODDLERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL PAY OFF. AND HOW AND WHEN WE INVEST IS CRITICAL WE KNOW FROM YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT OF OUR CHILDREN DO NOT HAVE A STRONG FOUNDATION EARLY ON IT WILL RESULT IN MORE CHALLENGES FOR THEM IS THEY ENTER AND MOVE THROUGH THE PK TWELVE. P. TO TWELVE SYSTEM. AS WE ROLL OUT UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. WE SEEK TO ALIGN P. THREE EFFORTS AND BEGIN DISCUSSION ABOUT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WE MUST KEEP INFANTS AND TODDLERS IN THE FOREFRONT. AN THAT OUR GOAL SHOULD BE THAT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES WORK TOGETHER TO HAVE INTENTIONALLY PLANNED FULLY FUNDED AND SUSTAINABLY IMPLEMENTED INFANT FAMILY AND EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. OUR FAMILIES ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED HARDSHIP STRESS AND LOSS DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC. THE IMPACT ON THE BABIES AND TODDLERS MENTAL HEALTH ALTHOUGH NOT IS EASILY VISIBLE IS HUGE. YOUNG CHILDREN ABSORB AND HOLD STRESS WE KNOW THAT EARLY INFANT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF RISK AND STRESS AND HELP FAMILIES DEVELOP BUFFERS. IN MONTEREY COUNTY WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP AND STRONG COALITION BETWEEN OUR FIRST FIVE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE FIRST FIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD COLLABORATIVE SUPPORT FAMILIES BY MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE PROVIDING A WARM WELCOME SCREENING ASSESSMENT CARE COORDINATION AND CONNECTION TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. BUT THE FUNDING IS NOT ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ALL FAMILIES WHO NEED IT. OUR COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE SEAMLESSLY CONNECTED WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT BOTH THE CHILDREN AND THE GROWN UPS IN THEIR LIVES. WRAPAROUND SERVICES ENTRUSTED PLACES THAT SUPPORT THE WHOLE CHILD THE WHOLE FAMILY AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY IS WHAT IS NEEDED. WE NEED SERVICES THAT BUILD RESILIENCE AND PREVENT LATER MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS BUILDING SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCE IS THE KEY TO LIFELONG HEALTH AND WELLBEING. WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IN AN INTENTIONAL AND HOLISTIC WAY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND THE STATE. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET THIS RIGHT. I ASK THAT YOU INVEST EARLY SO THAT OUR CHILDREN ENTERED THE FORMAL P. TWELVE SYSTEM READY TO LEARN AND RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANKS FOR PRESERVATION THAT MOVES US TO OUR LAST PRESENTER PENALTY- AND THAT IS MELISSA STAFFORD JONES THE DIRECTOR OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY.

AND CROSS SECTOR INTEGRATION. I ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MR JACKSON AROUND THE IMPORTANCE THAT THIS ECOSYSTEM BE A HEALING SYSTEM I THINK THAT IS PART OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TOGETHER FOR US. THE C. Y. B. H. I. OVERALL IS INCLUSIVE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH IT STRUCTURE OF INCLUDING CHILDREN AND YOUTH AGES ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE. AND RECOGNIZES THAT ADDRESSING EARLY CHILDHOOD IS KEY TO REALIZING THE VISION OF BUILDING A UPSTREAM PREVENTION ORIENTED SYSTEM. AND WE ARE WORKING TO DO THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE C. Y. B. H. I. BOTH THROUGH THE INITIAL OVERALL AND THROUGH SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF IT. SEVERAL SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE C. Y. B. H. I. PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND SUPPORTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS. INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DYADIC CARE BENEFIT AS NOTED IN IN THE COMMITTEES RIGHT UP. HOLDING TO PARTNERSHIP GRANTS WHICH INCLUDE PRESCHOOL EVIDENCE BASED THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES GRANT PROGRAM THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED THAT WILL INCLUDE ACCESS TO SUPPORTS AND LINKAGES TO SERVICES FOR PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN.

FOR THIS SPRING WE ARE PLANNING A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS BASED AYE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. AND THAT WILL INCLUDE THE PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN CHIU REALLY HELPED DEFINE WHAT IS REIMAGINE ECOSYSTEM COULD LOOK LIKE IN THE CONSTRUCT OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE. AND TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE OUTCOMES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE OUT OF THIS WORK TOGETHER AND THEN WORK BACKWARDS TO. THE WORK OF THE INITIATIVE LEADS US TO THOSE APPROVED OUT CUTS FOR CHILDREN ON. KELLY JUST IS ALSO EXPLORE OR- ONE IS A WORKING TYPE YOU'RE THINKING OF AS A PREVENT AS WELL WORK GROUP TO UPSTREAM PRIMARY. ISN'T ACROSS THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY ACROSS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ECOSYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WE RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH A PROVINCIAL ROADS AND ENGAGEMENT OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES IS A CRITICAL TO ADVANCING EQUITY. AS WE HEARD THIS AFTERNOON NOTED SO PROFOUNDLY THERE ARE STRUCTURAL AND SYSTEMIC. INEQUITIES THAT MANIFEST IN THE SYSTEMS VERY EARLY. INCLUDING AS WAS NOTED WITH YOUNG BLACK WASTE HAVING THE HIGHEST. RATES OF EXPULSION PRESCHOOL. WE ARE IN THE EARLY GROUNDWORK OF THE RESEARCH ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS TALKING WITH EXPERTS AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR AND ARE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING EXPLICIT RAP. APPROACHING THANK YOU WE HAVE A HEALTH INITIATIVE OR EARLY CHILDHOOD SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN IN EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE I THINK REFLECTING THAT THE STRUCTURE OF ITS HEARING. I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A LARGER CONTEXT OF EFFORTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVING CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INCLUDING AN EARLY CHILDHOOD AND IT'S CRITICAL AND IT'S REALLY INCUMBENT UPON THE WORK IN THE INITIATIVE TO CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE IMPACT FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AT BUILD THE ECOSYSTEM WITH NO WRONG DOOR AT A CENTER UNTIL. AS PART OF THAT COMMITMENT TO HER INTERNSHIP AN ECOSYSTEM APPROACH WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS ON A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES INCLUDING AND BEYOND WHICH YOU CAN USE YOUR HEALTH INITIATIVE. THAT RELATE TO THE BEHAVIOUR HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO SERVE AS A BASIS FOR COLLABORATION TO FIND REIMAGINE ECOSYSTEM. AND THAT LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION SPECIFIC. TO THE PROJECT FIVE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SO BACK AS WAS NOTED EARLIER CHECKING CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY WITH YOUNG CHILDREN RANGE OF ELEMENT IS SO RAPID. AND SO THE CONTEXT OF EFFORT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ONGOING EFFORTS SUCH AS LOOKING AT HOW THE ATC THE COR. MLS THE MASTER PLAN ON EARLY LEARNING CARE UNIVERSAL CHURCH HEY EXPANDING CHILD CARE. IMPLEMENTATION OF ASU'S SCREENING EXPANDING PAID FAMILY LEAVE LOOKING AT HOME VISITING. WE KNOW THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL PART OF THE FABRIC TO SUPPORT THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND IN OUR EFFORT TO LIMIT THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE AFFECTIVELY WE DON'T WANT TO JUST CREATE ANOTHER SITE LOAD EFFORT BUT WE WANT TO LOOK AT THIS WORK CONNECTED IN THIS LARGER CONTEXT OF INITIATIVES FOR HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT YOUNG CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIP WITH ZERO TO FIVE STAKEHOLDERS PARTNERS EXPERTS AND PARENTS AROUND DEVELOPING A ROBUST EARLY CHILDHOOD STRATEGY WITHIN THE INITIATIVE. AND AS PART OF THE REIMAGINE. THANK YOU AGAIN ATTEMPTING AND WATCHDOG. THANK YOU THINK FOR TESTIMONY I DO WANNA LET FOLKS THAT ARE. THE HEARING FOR THE MEMBERS AND HEARING ROOM THAT WE DO A OF Q. AND A ONLY AND I WILL DO READ THEIR NAY AND TITLES ARE SO NOW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WEALTH OF HARLEM BOYLAN DEPUTY DIRECTOR OFFICE OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES NINA **** FINANCE BUDGET ANALYST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SONORA PATEL PRINCIPAL PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST FROM THE FINANCE MEDICINE SHEFFIELD.

LEAVE I WILL BEGIN COST WITH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AMPLE MR TRUMP PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I STICK WITH- DIRECT STAFF JOHN IF I CAN EARLIER HAD A QUESTION OF SUPER OF THIS INITIATIVE BEING OVER FIVE YEARS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK FROM YOU WHEN IS IT REASONABLE FOR US TO EXPECT. SERVICES TO BEGIN TO BE ADMINISTERED TO THOSE WHO ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF ZERO AND TWENTY FIVE. AND I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP FROM THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I MISTER CHAIR D. I'M ONE OF THE THINGS WE RECOGNIZE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE WORK AROUND THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS THAT THE VERY IN PROTEST THAT LED. TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THIS BOLD LEADERSHIP MOVE AND CREATE THIS INITIATIVE WAS THE- MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS AND CRISIS FACING OUR CHILDREN YOUTH THAT YOU'RE VERY POINT OF COURSE EXIST TODAY AS WELL. AND THAT THE WORK OF THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE AS YOU KNOW. IS AN INITIATIVE OVER TIME THAT IS MEANT TO TACKLE SOME OF THE LARGE SYSTEMS LEVEL CHANGES THAT WE KNOW ARE NEEDED SINCE WE KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS. EFFORTS OUT THE STATE AND DIFFERENT FACTORS EDUCATION AND HELPING UNITY AND HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE SYSTEMS GET AS THE OUTCOMES THAT WE ALL WANT AND NEED AND SHARE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. SO THE CHALLENGE BEFORE IT IS HOW DO WE BUILD ON THAT WORK. ALSO DO YOU THE TRANSFORMATIVE WORK WE NEED TO DO TO REALLY MAKE THESE EFFORTS SYSTEMIC. AND SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AND WHILE WE DO NOT WORK AND THE CHILDREN YOU HAVE A HEALTH INITIATIVE WE'RE VERY CONFIDENT THERE ALSO WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING IN THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM FOR. THE MID TERM AND THIS LONGER TERM WORK ALL AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE CAN'T ONLY BE FOCUSED ON A LONGER TERM WORK OF THIS INITIATIVE. THIS INITIATIVE ALSO IS HAPPENING I'M A PARTS OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR DIFFERENT TIMELINES SO THERE ARE DIFFERENT EFFORTS THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY AND I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT SOME OF THOSE AT THE NEXT. PANEL AS WELL AT. THERE ARE EFFORTS ARE. EMPLOYMENT THAT BEGINNING NOW SO IN. THE THAT HEALTH CARE ACT AND FOR TO. IS REAL TO FOR. THEY ARE WORKING TO BE SUPPORTING AND INVESTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS THROUGH THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE. IN VARIOUS EXISTING OUT WORKFORCE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE CHILDREN NEED. OUR HELP I WORKFORCE COMING INTO THE SPRING AND SUMMER. THERE IS WORK THAT IS HAPPENING MORE IMMEDIATE. AS WELL AS LONGER TERM. AND AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD JUST NOTE THERE ARE ALSO. A LOT OF OTHER RELATED INITIATIVES AREN'T TECHNICALLY PART OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES. THAT ARE HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE TO SUPPORT MORE IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES AND RESPONSE. TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WHICH- I- PREFIGURED THAT RESPONSE AND- WILL OUT MOST OF ARE STILL ARE ATTENDING SCHOOLS- STARTING IN SEPTEMBER AND FOR US WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO INFORM PARENTS AND STUDENTS WHAT TO EXPECT IN THIS UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE- ACTIONABLE RESULTS. WHEN IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR US TO BE MESSAGING AND ENCOURAGING AND HOW DO WE HELP TO BUILD THAT OUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF CONVERSATION THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE HAPPY. BUT I. I DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT THE CHILDREN PARTNERSHIP IN FIRST FIVE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION WITH IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. IN THE NEED FOR US TO HELP TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE AS A PRIORITY POPULATION THAT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU DIRECTOR AND GET. A BIT OF A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TARGETED RESOURCES TO THIS POPULATION AND I'M GOING TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK TOWARDS THE SCHOOL LINKED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS. THAT YOU MENTIONED WE ARE SPENDING FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION OVER TWO YEARS. BOTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND IN I THOUGHT IT WAS K. TWELVE BUT YOUR TESTIMONY JUST NOW SAID THAT THE SCHOOL AND PARTNERSHIPS ALSO WILL INCLUDE. PRESCHOOL AND I'M WONDERING WHY WE DIDN'T CREATE A SPECIAL KERR ABOUT. EARLIER ON IN THAT ZERO TO FIVE BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH ABOUT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT AGE WHY WE- DIDN'T. SET ASIDE SPECIFIC RESOURCES DURING THAT SCHOOL LINKED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIP'S. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I'LL I'LL START AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. MY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES COLLEAGUES WHO ARE LEADING NOT IN THAT PART OF THE INITIATIVE MAY ALSO WANT TO SHARE SOME OF THE WORK AND THINKING AND PLANNING THAT THEY ARE DOING AROUND IT. I THINK WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO YOUR POINT MAKING SURE THAT ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE INITIATIVE WHERE EVER THAT IS POSSIBLE CHIU YI THINKING ABOUT WHAT ARE AT THAT. THAT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION STRATEGY YOU CAN PUT IN PLACE IN PLACE AND IN BAD IN THIS RE IMAGINED ECOSYSTEM. AS I SHARED AT A CRITICAL PART IN THE VISION AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH MANY MANY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. IS AN INCREDIBLE SHARED VISION AROUND IS- INCLUDING H. YOU THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE SHIFT THE SYSTEMS WE HAVE FROM BEING MORE RESPONSIVE MODE WHICH WE NEED TO. RAISE WHICH ALL RIGHT TO BE HERE FOR HELPING. YOU ALSO IS THE OPPORTUNITY THIS IS THE MOMENT AS THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID. REALLY SHIPPED THE FOCUS OF THE ECOSYSTEM AND BUILD AND THESE PRIMARY PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION APPROACHES THAT WE KNOW ARE CRITICAL THAT WE WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO CATCH UP WITH THE FULL NEED. IF YOU DON'T ALSO FOCUSED INTENSIVELY ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION IS THAT WE ARE WORKING EMBED BACK ACROSS THE INITIATIVE AND REALLY ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE THE ECOSYSTEM GOES EVEN BEYOND WHAT'S IN THAT THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. ALL OF THE CONNECTED EFFORTS ARE HAPPENING AND REALLY SETTING A TABLE TOGETHER THAT LET STAKEHOLDERS HERE IN STANLEY'S CHILDREN AND YOUTH THEMSELVES AND EXPERTS AND PARTNERS IN THIS PARK AND THANK HOW DO WE MAKE THAT SHIFT TO MORE PREVENTION UPSTREAM ORIENTED ECOSYSTEM WITH THE CONCRETE THAT IT'S- ADDED JEEZ. THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE TO DO THAT AND THAT IS WHAT WE IMAGINE FOR THIS WORKING GROUP CONCEPT THAT WORKS BRING TO PUT IN PLACE TO HELP GUIDE THE WORK INITIATIVE. AND WITHOUT IF IT'S I WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE CHAIR. AT THE BOTTOM HAVE BEEN DESCRIPTORS THIS IS NOT TALK ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC. AT THE END OF. IT RIGHT. I LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE OF HEALTH CARE SIR I WOULD ALL ASK IF WE COULD BETTER CLARITY REGARDING THE FOUR HUNDRED- IT SHOULD BE THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION HOW MUCH OF THAT IS GOING TO BE EARMARKED SPECIFICALLY FOR ZERO TO FIVE- SINCE WE HERE MARKED FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HOW DO WE MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE THAT SAME PRIORITY TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. GOOD AFTERNOON JC COOPER STATE MEDICAID DIRECTOR- SO YOU ARE CORRECT WE DID NOT SPECIFICALLY EARMARK- FUNDS WERE ZERO TO FIVE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID FOR. A HIGHER EDUCATION HOWEVER- THIS POPULATION WILL BE VERY CRITICAL TO ALL OF THE PLANET WE'RE DOING I'M SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE SCHOOLING SERVICES- AND GRANTS THAT WILL BE GOING OUT- WHERE WE WILL HAVE. A KEY FOCUS ON ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN A PUBLICLY FUNDED PRESCHOOLS AND CHILD CARE CENTERS I TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ALSO LINKING IN AND THINKING AT THE PREVENTIVE. A NATURE OF THESE DOLLARS AND NOT JUST WITHIN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING WITH HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ALSO AS WE LOOK ACROSS IN AND ENGAGE WITH OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH THINK TANK THAT WILL HELP INFORM. WHICH OF THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WE THINK WE NEED TO SCALE UP ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT WITH AN AYE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND SPECIFICALLY. LOOKING AT ENSURING THAT THESE WILL CUT ACROSS ALL OF THE AGE GROUPS INCLUDING THE ZERO TO FIVE POPULATIONS. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH INDIVIDUALS AND KNOW THERE WILL BE MANY MORE TO SHAPE THE FINAL. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WE SELECT IN A SCALE UP ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE FUNDING ACROSS THE SCHOOLING. OF BRANDS WHICH INCLUDES THOSE. AT PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE CENTERS PROVIDING ENOUGH RESOURCES TO THIS TARGETED POPULATION BASED ON. THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HARD TODAY AS I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BEGIN. THAT FOUNDATION AS EARLY AS WE CAN- I WOULD LIKE TO. FILE PROVIDE ONE FINAL QUESTION IF I COULD. I'M WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON- DIRECTOR STAFFORD JONES COMMENT ON THE NEED FOR US TO BE CONNECTED AND- WILL FOLLOW UP ON MONEY SANDOVAL'S. COMMENTS REGARDING- THOSE CHILDREN WHO ARE FACING INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY OR CURRENTLY SERVE THROUGH OUR REGIONAL CENTERS I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM BOTH OF YOU- IF YOU COULD DESCRIBE WHAT NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO. HELP US TO BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS BETWEEN- THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE- PROVIDING SPECIALIZED SERVICES TO THAT TARGETED POPULATION. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION CHAIR ARAMBULA I AND- IT IT WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL AS I MENTIONED ALL OF THE LANDSCAPE OF THE DIFFERENT INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH AGES ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE. I'M LOOKING FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES OF WHERE CAN WE NEED ENACTED INTEGRATE THIS THESE PIECES WHERE CAN WE THINK ABOUT REALLY DESIGNING THIS AS AN ECOSYSTEM WHERE IT WE ARE COORDINATED ACROSS THESE EFFORTS TO A GREATER DEGREE THEN PERHAPS WE ARE TODAY. SO FOR EXAMPLE PART OF OUR WORK IN. HHS IS YOU HAVE. INTERNAL WORKING GROUP ACROSS ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF HHS AND THAT INCLUDES THE DEPARTMENT OF- DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES THEY ARE NOT THE LEAD ON A SPECIFIC WORKSTREAM COMPONENT FOR EXAMPLE IN THE INITIATIVE. THEY ARE A PART OF OUR EFFORTS OF OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE PLANNING A HARD WORK TOGETHER. THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THOSE PLACES WHERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THOSE CONNECTIONS AND BUILD OUT THE ECOSYSTEM IN AN INCLUSIVE WAY. FOR ALL CHILDREN. FIVE I. WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM ST AS WE AS LIKE ABOUT AN OFF. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS HERE ARE WHAT I WOULD JUST SHARE IS THAT IN CALFORNIA COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE REGULARLY WORKING WITH THE- REGIONAL CENTERS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE CHILDREN AND YOUTH THAT DO PRESENT WITH. CO OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES AND WHILE MANY OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE WANTING TO PARTNER WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. THEY ARE AS MUCH IF NOT MORE RESOURCE STRAPPED AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES ARE AND WE'RE FINDING ACROSS THE STATE THAT DESPITE THE DESIRE OF THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO WORK AND PARTNER WITH US THAT THERE. IS A LACK OF SPECIALIZED PROVIDERS FOR THEM TO RELY ON- ACROSS THE ENTIRE CONTINUUM OF CARE SO THAT WOULD SPAN FROM THE LOWEST LEVEL OF SUPPORT SUCH AS SUPPORT AND SKILL BUILDING FOR FAMILIES- RESPITE CARE SERVICES FOR. FAMILIES TO YOU KNOW YOUR MID LEVEL TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS WHERE YOU'RE PROVIDING THERAPEUTIC BEHAVIOR SUPPORT TO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH TO TEACH THEM. IN LIEU SKILLS- TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. FOR PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN NOT ONLY DEALING WITH CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT THOSE WHO HAVE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS AS WELL AND THEN THE FAMILY CARE THAT'S AN ABSOLUTE NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT. THE WORKFORCE'S ABSOLUTELY LACKING IN THE NUMBER OF EXPERTS IN THAT NEEDS ALL THE WAY TO THE MARK HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE WHERE WHERE THERE REALLY ARE SOME CHILDREN IN YOUTH. THAT NEED RESIDENTIAL CARE AND IT'S SPECIALIZED CARE AGAIN BECAUSE OF THEIR CO OCCURRING NEEDS AND SO THERE'S JUST A LACK ACROSS THE WHOLE CONTINUING. AND IN TALKING WITH MY OWN REGIONAL CENTERS ON DIRECTOR YOU KNOW THAT GOD WILLING THAT THEY HAVE TO PARTNER WITH US IS TREMENDOUS BUT THEY ARE JUST UNABLE TO FIND THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. TO REALLY BUILD THIS CONTINUUM OF CARE SO THEY THEY NEED HELP. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUREAUS ARE WANTING TO PARTNER. WITH THEM AND WE'RE FINDING IT INCREDIBLY CHAU ALLEN G. TO ME THE NEEDS THESE KIDS AND FAMILY BECAUSE THERE IS JUST A LACK OF CONTINUAL CARE OPTIONS. I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS AND HOW WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS. THE DUAL DIAGNOSES THAT OCCURS WITHIN OUR IDT POPULATION AND- I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH IN OUR SUB COMMITTEE PROCESS TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN HELP TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS. AS I HAVE A REAL PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO THIS THAT. THE MORE WE CAN EARLY INTERVENE AND HELP TO PREVENT SOME OF THE DOWNSTREAM PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF NOT GETTING. THE SUPPORT AND RESILIENCY AT A YOUNG AGE LEADS TOWARDS DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR US IN THE STATE AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS AGAIN ON THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU- LET'S GO TO MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN- HI THERE THIS. THANK YOU- MY HEAD IS SPINNING A LITTLE BIT HERE I GUESS I CAN I DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF AN EXPERT IN DC BUT I KNOW A THING OR TWO- AND THE ZERO TO FIVE WORLD IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BUT I'M I'M HAVING. YOU KNOW WE'RE- I'M HAVING TROUBLE FOLLOWING YOU KNOW WHEN WE. WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR WORKFORCE- FOR PRESCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM- WE HAVE WE FELT WE ALLOCATE A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND NEW PRESCHOOL SLOTS- AND CHILD CARE SLOTS ARE CHILD CARE SLOTS LAST YEAR WE ADD AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY SIX THOUSAND. THINK ONLY FORTY TWO THOUSAND OF THOSE HAVE BEEN FILLED- AT I JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE THIS IS A HODGE PODGE AT THIS POINT OF HOW WEIRD IT OF HOW WE'RE ORGANIZING THIS AND WHAT ALSO CONCERNS ME. IS THAT. TOO OFTEN YOU DO GET DIAGNOSED WHETHER WHETHER IT'S AUTISM ANY OTHER ID DE. UM BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH. IT WHEN YOU ENTER KINDERGARTEN OR PRESCHOOL BUT WE'VE GOT TO START LOOKING EVEN EARLIER SO WHAT SYSTEMS WHO ARE WE GOING TO BE ENGAGING HERE WE NEED TO BE YES LOOKING IN THE CLASSROOM LOOKING AT CHILD CARE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE ENGAGING WITH PEDIATRICIANS I MEAN. CAN SOMEBODY JUST WALK ME THROUGH THE BASICS OF WHAT ACCESS TO RESOURCES ARE CARE WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR AN EIGHTEEN MONTH OLD THAT ISN'T IN CHILD CARE OR YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAVE A PARENT THAT DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS ACCESS WE GOTTA START EARLIER BEFORE SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF WALKING THROUGH THE BASICS OF HOW. SOME TYPE OF SOMEONE OF THAT TYPE OF CASE WITH ACCESS RESOURCES IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR ME. SO I DON'T KNOW WHO. WHO WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE UP PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE A- BABY START WITH MISS STAFFORD JONES WITH KELLY JUST US. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY WOMAN I THINK YOUR POINT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE PLACES WHERE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACCESS SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AS A WAY TO. HAVE A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN. HELLO THERE ARE ASPECTS OF WHICH WENT ARE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO PRIMARY CARE AND HOW DO WE SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING I HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN. AND ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN THE CONTEXT OF PRIMARY CARE. SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FOR EXAMPLE THE INITIATIVE INCLUDE INCLUDES I AM A CONSULTATION FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES AND CONSULTATION WITH THE HELP. I THANK HIGH INTEREST IN OTHERS SO THAT MAKES ONE BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THAT. IN THEIR PAPER FACT. SO THERE IS A THERE'S TRAINING FOR A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AS WELL WHO WORKS THERE. TO YEAH I MEANT THAT IT OF THE CARE BENEFIT IN THE PADDOCK HELP PROBE. IS PHILLY MEANT TO HAVE FOR IN PRIMARY CARE HOW WE SET. PROVIDER INCH ARMS I SUPPORTING THIS EMOTIONAL WELL OF CHILDREN. AND YOUR POINT THERE HAS TO BE THE TOP TO PLACES SO THAT'S IN THE- OFFICE THERE'S ALL IN LEARN SETTING WHETHER THAT IN CHAI CARE PRESCHOOL KATE TWELVE. AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION. LATER TODAY YOU'RE THINKING ACROSS THAT BASE WE KNOW OF ANY DRAIN OUR THAT IS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN'T IN THEIR FAMILIES CAN ACCESS SURFACED THIS. WHAT YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT CONTEXT AND THERE WERE ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY CONTEXT INFORMATION A PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ADDRESSING STIGMA HEAD ON. IT AS THE CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND APPROPRIATE SO THAT PEOPLE YOU'LL LIKE THEY CAN AND WILL BE SUPPORTED IN ACCESSING THE SERVICES THAT THEIR CHILDREN IN NEED AND FOR YOU DIRECTLY YEAH I THINK THAT SURFACED STEP. YES I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT YEP YOU THINK ABOUT EACH EIGHT I THINK THE CRITICAL PART IN YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND HOW WE SUPPORT SOCIAL. EMOTIONAL WELL BEING. THANK THANK YOU FOR SO MUCH FOR THAT CLEARING I DO REALLY LOOK FORWARD KNOW THAT ARE IS A VERY HERE TO FIVE OF NEED THESE AND RESOURCES MORE THAN EVER AND I REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING THIS DEVELOP- AND BEING A PART OF CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU LET'S MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN WENT THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANT TO KIND OF FOLLOW UP WITH THAT IS I MEAN. PROVIDERS ITSELF. I KNOW THERE'S A HUGE HUGE SOURCES OUT THERE. WHAT ARE THE STEPS WERE DOING TO GETTING OUR SOFTWARE YOU KNOW CHILDREN EVEN YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE SPEECH THERAPY I MEAN THE WEIGHTLESS IS INCREDIBLE TO GET ON THE SITE. OF FOR STEEP SPEECH THERAPY N. I KNOW THAT PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT I KNOW. WAIT FOR MONTHS TO GET ON TO SPEECH THERAPY I MEAN IT EVEN IF THEY HAD PRIVATE INSURANCE EITHER ONE IT'SSO DIFFICULT AND ON THE WAIT LIST IS SO LONG NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. HOW CAN WE GET MORE PROVIDERS OR TEACHERS. TO GET TRAINED AND HOW SOON CAN THAT BE SO THAT WE CAN THEN MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT LOSING MORE CHILDREN AS THE DAYS GO BY. WOULD YOU LIKE ME THAT THIS IS TERRIBLE. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK THAT IS A CRITICAL ISSUE BECAUSE WE THERE ARE EFFORTS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THAT CONSTRUCT WE TALKED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT AGO AROUND THE NEED TO THINK ABOUT SHORT. TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES THERE ARE MULTIPLE EFFORTS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW I'M BOTH. OUT IN THE FIELD ALREADY AND UNDER DEVELOPMENT TO SUPPORT BY INCLUDING. TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS BOTH IN EARLY LEARNING AND TEACHER TWELVE AND OTHER SYSTEMS- AND PARENTS SHOULD HAVE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO HELP SUPPORT. THEIR TO. BEING AND RESILIENCE SKILLS IN THIS YEAR REALLY REALLY CHALLENGING CHALLENGING TIME FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES SO THAT WORK IS ALREADY HAPPENING AND STARTED THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE DEPLOYED OVER THE LAST FEW FUNDS TO SUPPORT AT WORK. AND EDUCATE- IN THE SETTINGS SUPPORT ABILITY TO SUPPORT. DIFFERENT VIDEO AND TRAINING RESOURCES AND IT WAS MENTIONED THERE IS FURTHER WORK HAPPENING IN THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL FINISH UP AROUND THAT WITH THE OFFICE OF. SEVERAL DEVELOPING. I'M INFORM TRAINING FOR EDUCATORS BOTH EARLY LEARNING AND CARE FOR TWELVE pYEAR- UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE TRAUMA AND THEN WILL HELP IDENTIFY THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE CONNECTED TO OTHERS. THAT THEY- THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT EIGHT SO WE HAVE. SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM GOALS. HOW I MEAN I GUESS I MEAN I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE. BUT THE WAIT LATE THE WAITING IS STILL THERE TODAY. I'M WHAT CAN WE DO TO ME BEYOND THE VIDEOS BEYOND TRYING TO IDENTIFY EVEN IF YOU IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM HOW LONG WOULD THESE CHILDREN WAITING TO GET INTO THAT DOOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE RAISING SUCH A KEY ISSUE WHICH IS THIS WORK FORCE COMPONENT I THINK YOU HEARD IT FROM ALL OF THE PRESENTERS TODAY I THINK WE'LL HEAR EVEN MORE OF THE PRESENTERS AS THE DAY GOES ON. BECAUSE ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS THE WORKFORCE CAPACITY AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THAT INCLUDING. I'M I THINK THE STIGMA THAT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAS RESULTED IN UNDER INVESTMENT IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS A CORE ESSENTIAL NEED AND WE ARE LIVING WITH SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THAT NOW. AT THE SAME TIME AND WE ARE TAKING STEPS THERE IS WORK HAPPENING BOTH IN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE INITIATIVE IS IN DEVELOPING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WE CANNOT PRODUCE A WORK FORCE. AND YOU KNOW OVERNIGHT BUT THAT THOSE THAT WORK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THERE ARE EFFORTS HAPPENING. DEVELOP NEW PARTS OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TEAM TO SUPPORT ON YOUTH INCLUDING A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COACH FULL THAT YOU THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I THINK THE STUFF EITHER WORK FORCE. START ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN. AARON'S THERE'S INVESTMENT HAPPENING IN EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TRY TO GET MORE PEOPLE THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU ARE INTERESTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. EFFORTS TO BUILD THE LINE UP THAT WORK FOR YOU RIGHT INVESTMENT IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE IS KEY THERE ALSO I AM SEVERAL PROPOSALS THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CARE KANEMI REPORT IN THIS CURRENT A BUDGET PROPOSAL SHE WILL REALLY TAKE ON THIS ISSUE I'M ADDRESSING OUR HEALTH REPORTS THAT WE NEED FOR THE STATE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH BUT ALSO FOR ALL CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU I AND I. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEES BECAUSE THEY I THINK IT'S VERY CRITICAL- OUR CHILDREN LEARN WITHIN THOSE FIVE YEARS THE MOST AND AS WE CAN HELP THEM THE DEVELOPMENT IS THERE FOR A MINUTE THERE DEVELOPMENT WILL EITHER WE HELP THEM OR WE WON'T. I'M SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU MISTER HOPE WE CAN TAKE A BREAK FROM OF THE REALLY PROMPT QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKING. MY QUESTION IS ARE WE FOCUSING AT ALL OF OUR ATTENTION AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DEALING WITH KIDS THAT HAVE. ARE REACTING TO SOMETHING LOT OF THINGS THAT MAYBE WE'RE DOING THEY ARE CREATING THOSE STRESSORS THAT ARE CREATING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. AND I THINK THE MORE WE KNOW ABOUT THOSE THINGS. THE MORE WE CAN. THAT BE PREVENTATIVE IN IN TRYING TO IN AG I CAN USE AN EXAMPLE ESSENTIALLY WHEN I WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. I DON'T REMEMBER HIGH SCHOOL LIKE WHEN MY KIDS WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WHEN MY KIDS WENT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THERE UP TILL THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING DOING HOMEWORK THEY WERE DOING ALL OF THESE THINGS THAT WE HAVE CREATED IS A- A NETWORK IN SCHOOLING THEN CREATED STRESS- NOW THEY HAVE FACEBOOK TO DEAL WITH AND ALL THESE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA THINGS. ALL OF THOSE STRESSORS I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON IDENTIFYING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE KIDS THAT ARE DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE TO TRY TO PULL OUT OF BEING DAMAGED. DO YOU IS THERE ANY EFFORTS BEING MADE TO. TO LOOK AT THE STRUCTURE OF HOW WE'RE WE'RE OFFERING EDUCATION. AND MAYBE WE'RE PUSHING TOO HARD ON SOME AREAS AND PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON PEOPLE. AND THEIR PARENTS AND ALL THAT STRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE WHEN THAT WHEN THE ADULTS ARE STRESSED. WELL THE KIDS ARE STRESSED. I LEARNED THIS DO YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS A BIT BATTALION CHIEF YOU HAD TO GO ON SCENE YOU'D BETTER BE CALM. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT CALM EVERYBODY ELSE GOES JUST AS IS DEBT YOU KNOW STRESSED AS YOU ARE. AND EVERYTHING FALLS APART AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I SEE IN THIS SITUATION. IS WE'RE NOT DOING OUR JOB AS ADULTS. N. N. N. MAYBE WE'RE JUST PUSHING TOO HARD ON THESE KIDS AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR WHAT YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS ON ON THE AMOUNT OF STRESS THAT WE'RE PUTTING ON OUR KIDS. ANYBODY. PLEASE YEAH THERMOSTAT FOR JUDGES LIKE TAYLOR FIRST ADDRESS THAT OR SOMEONE ELSE ON THE- PRESENTERS FOR Q. AND A PANEL WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT AND THEN AFTER THAT WE'LL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. I WILL JUST SHARE AS AS I MENTIONED I DO YOU THINK LOOKING AT THE CONNECTIONS TO OTHER BODIES OF WORK AND INITIATIVES THAT ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOCIAL FACTORS THAT WE KNOW A FACT- SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING IS. IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONNECTING THE WORK WITH THE CHILDREN EAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. WITH THOSE OTHER EFFORTS IN OTHER TABLES WHERE THAT WORK IS HAPPENING I'LL LEAVE IT TO MY- COLLEAGUES TO SPEAK WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE OPPORTUNITIES I TEACH YOU IT SHOULD BE. RIGHT THANKS. PLEASE IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY- IN ADDITION TO MISS STAFFORD JONES PLEASE GOD SPEAK NOW. YEAH YES I'M I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WITNESS FROM TODAY AND GO. TINA SLOAN. THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION UNDERSTANDING IS KIDDING GO AT AN AMAZING- PROVIDER OF EARLY AT IN THE BAY AREA RIGHT LARGER STATE CONTRACT HE'S- PROVIDES THIS ENHANCED MENTAL HEALTH EFFORT WITH THE- RATE INCREASE THAT WE- RECENTLY DID FOR THE- CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. HE TALKED MORE ABOUT HOW YOU DID THAT HOW IT ALL WORKS AND WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD BE REQUIRING THAT ARE FOCUSING ON EXPANDING THAT AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. SURE YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- AND THE THOUGHTFULNESS AROUND. WHAT ARE REQUIRED FOR OUR EARLY CARE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY SUPPORT THE MENTAL HEALTH. OF BOTH PROVIDERS AND CHILDREN. I'M NOT KIDDING THOUGH WE SERVE- WITHIN THREE COUNTIES- ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTERS AND OVER A HUNDRED- AND THIRTY CLASSROOMS AND OUR CONSULTATION. APPROACH WE DELIVER I'M MULTI LEVEL- INTERVENTION. THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY LOOKING- INTERVENING SPECIFIC AROUND CHILDREN AND SUPPORTING THE ADULTS BUT THEIR CARE- BUT ALSO- LOOKING AT THE OF IN THE ENVIRONMENT THE CURRICULUM- WHAT ARE THE STRESSORS WITH IT THAT ARE CREATING CONDITIONS- WITHIN THE CLASSROOM SETTING FOR BOTH TEACHERS- FOR FAMILIES YOU KNOW AND FOR CHILDREN- AND THAT AREN'T PROMOTING THEIR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. I'M IN SO IT IS AN INTERVENTION THAT LOOKS ECOLOGICALLY ACROSS THE SYSTEM WITH ACROSS THE PROGRAM- IN ORDER TO ADDRESSED THE MULTIPLE COMPLEX FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF ALL THAT ARE- WITHIN THAT SYSTEM. OUR MODEL SPECIFICALLY- MEETS WITH OUR TEACHING TEENS- BOTH UP AS A GROUP EVERY WEEK SO EVERY CLASSROOM- TEACHING TEAM MEETS WITH A CONSULTANT- EVERY WEEK TO DISCUSS AND PROCESS- THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE. THE TEACHERS WELL BEING AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE PRESENT AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR ABILITY TO PARTNER WITH FAMILIES DEVELOPMENT TRAINING AROUND EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH- TYPE OF TOPICS INCLUDING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE ATTACHMENT- AND OTHER AREAS- INCLUDING HOW TO ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS- AND OTHER POWER DYNAMICS. THAT HAPPENED WITHIN- ENCOUNTERS AND INTERACTIONS WITH AND- THE EASY SYSTEM. SO IT IS AN INTERVENTION THAT AIMS TO HOLD ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FACTORS- THAT CONTRIBUTE TO EITHER DIMINISHING THE MENTAL HEALTH- OR PROMOTING THE MENTAL HEALTH- AND HOW ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PIECES DO INFLUENCE- HOW A CHILD OR A GROUP OF CHILDREN IN THE CLASSROOM- ART ARE DOING. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT BOB LET'S NOT A QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR THE STAFFER JONES AND I BELIEVE IT WAS IN HER TESTIMONY WHERE SHE HAD TALKED ABOUT- CAL H. KELLY TELLS US. TALKING ABOUT INCORPORATING A PLAN FOR CHILDREN YOUTH AND PARENTS AND YOU KNOW TO BE THAT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE THE DYADIC THERAPY. THAT I KNOW THAT'S COMMITTEES ARE DISCUSSED N THE PAST. BUT IN THAT I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS SOMEONE MEMORABLE TOUCHED ON THIS BUT THE SCREENING FOR LIKE AUTISM LEARNING DISABILITIES HOW THAT TIES IN. IS THAT PRIMARILY IS COLLEGES US THINKING THEY'RE GOING TO WORK THROUGH THE REGIONAL CENTERS TO THE CONTINUUM. CONTINUUM'S OF CARERS AT WITH. THE ORGANIZATIONS AND MAYBE THE PRESENTERS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTING HERE. AND IF YOU'RE PLANNING ALL OF THIS. AND THAT TELLS ME THAT YOU HAVE A BUDGET IN MIND. TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THIS AND SO YOU KNOW GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR OPPORTUNITY HERE. BASED OFF OF YOUR PLAN TO DO THIS. WHAT AMOUNT DO YOU NEED TO KIND OF GET THIS OFF AND RUNNING. I THINK IT'S A QUESTION GERMANS HOUSE I. I THINK THAT THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS. I AM. IN THINKING ABOUT THIS ECOSYSTEM IS FOCUSED ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOME CHILDREN THAT HAVE THOSE NEEDS HAVE OTHER NEEDS AS WELL. AND IT'S STILL PART OF THE WORK OF THE INITIATIVE EVEN THOSE SOME OF THOSE OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT NECESSARILY DIRECTLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE INITIATIVE. THAT PART OF OUR WORK IS FIGURING OUT WHERE THOSE CONNECTION POINTS ARE SO THAT IS WE ARE DESIGNING THE ECOSYSTEM WE ARE REALLY BUILDING UP MORE OF THAT AND- CONNECT THEIR COACH FAMILIES IN WHICH THEIR NEEDS ARE CENTERED IN THE PROCESS. SO IT THIS INITIATIVE DOES NOT NECESSARILY TAKE ON DIRECTLY ALL OF THOSE OTHER ISSUES BUT WE ARE VERY COMMITTED TO BEING CONNECTED TO OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE ADDRESSING. OTHER NEEDS THAT CHILDREN AND YOUTH THEY HAVE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS CREEK NEEDED APPROACH WERE. CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. I UNDERSTAND AND SO IN THE SEACOAST. THAT YOU'RE DEVELOPING AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS BUT- HOW MUCH ARE WE HOW MUCH IS CAL HSS FOCUSING ON THE ZERO TO FIVE POPULATION AS OPPOSED TO THE REST OF THE POPULATION. FOR THE INITIATIVE. OKAY THE QUESTION AND SO AS WAS NOTED EARLIER THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT INCLUDE ZERO TO FIVE AS PART OF THE OVERALL WORK BUT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY FIND YOUR MARK I EACH OF THOSE COMPONENTS. WERE THAT SPECIFIC AGE GROUP. THAT ZERO TO FIVE POPULATION AND THEIR AND THEIR PARENTS WILL BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK YOU HEARD IN TERMS OF THAT I'M SCHOOLING CAPACITY BUILDING GRANTS THE EVIDENCE BASED GRANTS IN TERMS OF I'M SUPPORTING AND SCALING PROMISING PRACTICE. BIRCH PLATFORM. THERE IS NOT YOUR MARCH FINDS PER SE BUT THERE IS- INCLUSION OF ZERO TO FIVE IN THE. A RANGE OF THE COMPONENTS WITH- YEAH AND I THINK IT WAS MEANT TO THERE WAS A FIVE HUNDRED. BILL EARMARKED. THE OTHER END BUT NOT THE LAW THE ZERO TO FIVE AND SO. I GUESS AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT- BUT- WANTED TO JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION A QUICK QUESTION OF. YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR PRESENTERS ORGANIZATIONS OF PEOPLE LISTENING IN BUT WHAT ARE THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD. MAYBE BE HIGHLIGHTING WE EITHER WITH YOURSELF OR WITH PERMANENT FINANCE. YOU KNOW I REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RULE. DISPARITIES AND SOME OF THE ACCESS FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND- AND SOME OF THE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. LIKE WATER THINGS THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT I MEAN IS IT ALL JUST GOING TO BE. VERY EVIDENCE BASED METRICS- WHAT ARE THE THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIRMAN DEAN. ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT NEXT PHASE OF THE WORK OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS WE ARE GETTING READY TO START A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS. I AM AS I MENTIONED VERY BRIEFLY BUT AS A ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT WILL INCLUDE CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES BUT ALSO. STAKEHOLDERS MEMBERS THE COMMUNITIES TO REALLY I'M HERE AND HAVE DISCUSSIONS ARE AROUND. WHAT SHOULD THE REIMAGINE ECOSYSTEM LOOK LIKE IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WE HAVE WITH THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH HERE ARE HEALTH INITIATIVE. WE WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEPLOYING ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE CHILDREN YOU'VE EVER HEALTH INITIATIVE. IN FIVE YEARS AND MAYBE EVEN BEYOND WE KNOW THAT SOME OF SYSTEM. JEFFERTS OPPONENTS WILL HAVE IMPACT SKINNER AND OTHERS WILL TAKE A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. BUT WHAT ARE WE AIMING FOR WHAT WOULD THAT REIMAGINE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE AND YOUR POINT WHAT OUTCOMES% WOULD BE SEEN BUT WOULD BE DIFFERENT. FIVE YEARS IF E WERE EFFECTIVE TOGETHER IN TAKING ON THIS WORK AND RE IMAGINING AND CREATING. THIS IMPROVED ECOSYSTEM. AND WE ARE LOOKING TO NOT TRY TO DEFINE THAT. WERE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND FAMILIES WE ARE LOOKING TO TRY TO FIND THAT WITH THEM. AS PART OF THIS STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS SO THAT THESE BEING. SHARED OUTCOMES INFORMED BY THE EXPERIENCES OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND INFORMED BY THE EXPERIENCES AND EXPERTISE OF. pSYSTEMS INCLUDING HEALTH INCLUDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCLUDING EDUCATION INCLUDING EARLY LEARNING WE NEED ALL OF THE PARTNERS TO COME TOGETHER THIS IS NOT AN INITIATIVE THAT CAN BE DONE. EFFECTIVELY WITH ONLY ONE AGENCY OR ONE GROUP IT NEEDS TO BE A HOLISTIC APPROACH INCLUDING DEFINING WHAT THOSE OUTCOMES SHOULD BE SAID THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY BE WORKING TOWARD. ACCEPT INTERPRET SHORT TERM METRICS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO AND IN SHAPING THOSE OUT. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE LOTS TO THE AND FOR HEARINGS. PRITCHETT THAT MR. THANK YOU I'D TO THE ENTIRE SECOND PANEL AS WE NOW MOVE ON TO OUR THIRD PANEL ON THE K.

DENISE AND THAT HAD A LOT OF ITS CHALLENGES I GREW UP IN A COMMUNITY WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF SOME OF FULL BIG ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AND MEANWHILE IS ALSO NAVIGATING INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA- BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE BOTH VIETNAM WAR REFUGEES AND SO AT THIS AGE I WAS MAYBE FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN WHEN I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SELF LOVE FOR MY QUEER IDENTITY. AND ALSO CHRONIC ANXIETY BECAUSE I WAS CONSTANTLY IN FEAR IN TRYING TO HIDE ASPECTS OF MYSELF AND SO AT THIS TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO HELPFUL TO HAVE MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION- HAVING SUPPORTS AND SERVICES ME WIDE AVAILABLE KNOWN TO ME AS A YOUNG PERSON HOWEVER NONE OF THAT EDUCATION WAS REALLY AVAILABLE THROUGH ANY OF MY COURSES AT SCHOOL- OR ANY OF THE OUTREACH DONE BY MY SCHOOL. AND SO I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS SUPPORT OUT THERE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE SAME CHALLENGES AS MYSELF I THOUGHT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ME SO I TRIED TO HIDE THESE THINGS AND I INTERNALIZED ALL OF THESE ISSUES- IN MY COMMUNITY IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY SUBSTANCES WERE VERY EASILY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE MY AGE AT MY HIGH SCHOOL ON TO OTHER STUDENTS WHO WERE SELLING THEM. AND SO I STARTED TO STRUGGLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS IN EASY ARE COPING MECHANISM EASIER IN TERMS OF WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME- AND WHAT I SAW OTHER PEOPLE DOING. AND SO NOT ONLY WAS I DEALING WITH THE QUESTIONING IS IT AYE SIR TO DEVELOP- SUBSTANCE USED TO. ADDICTION AND- I WAS DEALING WITH ALL THIS ON MY OWN AND WHEN I STOPPED GOING TO CLASSES- I WASN'T WORKING WITH MY TEACHERS AND NOT RESPONDING TO THE OFFICE- I WAS MET WITH POLICE AT MY HOUSEHOLD. I REMEMBER SCHOOL POLICE COMING INTO MY HOUSE STARTING TO SEARCH THE FRONT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION WITHOUT MY PARENTS THEIR- AND THEY STOPPED WHEN I POSTED A PICTURE OF THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA- AND- YOU KNOW THROUGH THIS WHOLE PROCESS I WAS MADE TO FEEL VERY CRIMINALIZED. I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS SUPPORT I STARTED HIDING EVEN MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH THE COPS. FOR THE THINGS ARE STRUGGLING WITH. AND ULTIMATELY THIS LEADS TO ME EVENTUALLY DEALING WITH- TRIGGER WARNING HERE WITH SELF HARM SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND IDEATION AND I WAS- FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY CARE AGAIN NOT AS A FORM OF SUPPORT FOR MY SCHOOL AS A FORM OF. PUNISHMENT BECAUSE I WASN'T SHOWING UP NOW IS THE NARRATIVE THAT WAS BEING SENT TO ME. AS ALTERNATELY I REALLY URGE EVERYONE LISTENING TO CONSIDER. THE NEEDS TO. BRING IN A BEHAVE HEALTH LINES INTO OUR SCHOOLS- BRING ENDEL SUPPORTS AND SERVICES TO STUDENTS MAKING SURE THAT THEY KNOW WE'RE HERE TO HELP NOT HERE TO PUNISH THEM- AND MAKING SURE THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT SAFETY NET IS. IS MADE VISIBLY CLEAR FOR STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN REACH OUT FOR SUPPORT IN THOSE TIMES OF NEED- AND IRONICALLY WHERE I ENDED UP GETTING THE MOST. SUPPORT WAS NOT FROM MY SCHOOL BUT ACTUALLY ALL THE RESOURCES EXISTED MY COMMUNITY THE DANCE TEAMS I JOINED. THE FREE THERAPY SERVICES OFF ABLE TO ACCESS OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL AND SOUL AS MUCH AS I I'M INSISTING FOR SCHOOLS TO OFFER UP THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR YOUTH THAT HAVE THIS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANS. ALSO WANT US TO CONSIDER HOW MUCH WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO DO THIS WRK. AND HOW WE CAN LINK THEM WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS- SUCH AS THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE- AND SO WHILE WE PRIORITIZE YOUTH AND SCHOOLS ALSO WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT MY STORY ADVOCATES FOR ALL THE RESOURCES FOR YOUTH MAY NOT BE IN TRADITIONAL SCHOOL SETTING SO THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THOSE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES AS WELL. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THANK YOU- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR US TO HAVE. THOSE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE BEING ABLE TO SPEAK UP AND SPEAK OUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY YOU PROVIDED HERE TODAY. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM DIRECTOR MELISSA STAFFORD JONES. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE THE PANEL WITH AN OVERVIEW AND IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE OF THE OVERALL WORK AND THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. AS YOU KNOW IT WAS WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN CREATING THE C. Y. B. H. I. THAT CALIFORNIA IS REIMAGINING THE SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. ALL CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN AND YOUTH HIGH QUALITY CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE AND EASY TO ACCESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. THE INITIATIVE AIMS TO TAKE A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH AS WAS HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER IN TERMS OF THE HOPES FOR THE INITIATIVE. SEEKING TO ENTER AN EXTORTIONATE MOTIONAL WELL BEING BUILT INTO THE SYSTEMS THAT SURROUND CHILDREN INCLUDING IN. VARIOUS SPORTING CITING HEALTH SETTINGS AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS AS MR JUST SPOKE THE POWERFULLY CHIU THE IMPORTANT FIVE. AND INTO PORTANTINO THIS IS FOR ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH AGES ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE AND INCLUDES BOTH COMMUNITY LEVEL APPROACHES TO BEACH WRITTEN YOU. BUT DISTRICT PARTNERSHIPS WITH EDUCATION OR AND AN OLD PAIR OF COVERAGE INCLUDING MEDICAID AND COMMERCIAL HEALTH INSURANCE. USING TARGETED UNIVERSALISM THE INITIATIVE HAS A VISION FOR IMPROVING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WELLNESS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH.

WHERE THE THINKING SHIPS SO THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR KIDS IS THOUGHT ABOUT TALKED ABOUT ACTED ON BY ALL OF US AND BY THROUGHOUT OUR SYSTEMS IN THE IN THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT OTHER BASIC NEEDS CHILDREN TO TRY SUCH AS HEALTHY FOODS. EXERCISE B. AS FOUNDATION OF THAT IS PART OF OUR WORK TO CREATE THAT TERMS OF ADDRESSING STIGMA AND PUBLIC AWARENESS AROUND THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL. EMOTIONAL WELL BEING FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THIS IS THE TIME I AM HEARING BEFORE AND COMMITTEE THIS IT'S I ALSO JUST WANTED TO VERY BRIEFLY INTRODUCE MYSELF KNOWING THOUGH THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

AND THAT'S WHY I FEEL SO. HONORED TO BE A PART OF THIS BURKE. HERE WE UP. FOR KELLY TO TEST IN THIS BURKE YEAR OF THE- IS A LAME FOUNDATION FOR THE APPROACH OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING THE WORK OF THE INITIAL. TOGETHER WE CAN ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL CHANGE. WE KNOW AND MANY MANY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS HAVE TOLD US IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. THAT SIMPLY MAKING IMROVEMENTS TO THE CURRENT SILOS HE HAS IS IN ADEQUATE.

OUR GOAL IS TO ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATIONS OF A PROGRAM THAT CAN BEST SERVE OUR STUDENTS BASED ON THE BOTH BASED ON BOTH THE CURRENT ME. AND PROGRAMS AND BE WELL SUITED TO INCORPORATING OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE FUTURE SUCH AS THOSE PROPOSALS THAT THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MENTIONED. OR WHATEVER ELSE THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT REQUIRE. CITY IS TAKING PROACTIVE STEPS TO FIND AND RECRUIT CANDIDATES FOR THESE CRITICAL POSITIONS WHO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE REQUIRED BY STATUTE. AND WHO ALSO. A SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. LOOK BACK I WILL CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY IN THE INTEREST OF TIME MONICA MEDICAL CENTER WILL NOT PRESENT THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF CD. SHE AND I ARE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY I THINK YOU ARE WE'RE OKAY- WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES WILL GO NOW TO. ADD TO BE VIEWING THOSE. A RARE PERSON HERE A LIVING BREATHING HUMAN BEING IN A COMMITTEE HEARING. THANK YOU TOBY FOR JOINING US THANK YOU. RT THANK YOU AS A MEMBER AND THAT MISTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR PRITCHETT THE CHANCE TO BE HERE- I WAS HOPEFUL THAT I WOULD NOT BE ALONE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME OTHERS IN THE ROOM BUT IT'S I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO JOIN YOU IN PERSON. AND I WILL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I'M NOT ONLY HAVE YOU HAD A LONG DAY ALREADY THAT YOUR DATE WILL GET LONGER- SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT AYE I'M MY NAME'S TOBY DOING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON TO- BUDGETING PROPOSALS AND TO STAY COLOR FUNDING REQUEST AND THEN GIVE A BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE SERVING. THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH- IN IN ESSENCE YOU'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ONE OF THESE BCPS IT IS FOR IT REFERS TO THE FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN AN INTER AGENCY AGREEMENT THAT WE WOULD DEVELOP THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AROUND- STRENGTHENING ABBOTT THE USE OF IT IN SPACE PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE. IN SERVING CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DOING THIS WORK ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK ON YOUTH DROP IN AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY EXTEND THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN IN TERMS OF AREAS WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. PARTICULARLY IN RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITY SERVICE KEEP THAT IN MIND- PART OF OUR WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE SO WE CAN GROW THE NUMBER OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE THAT'S NOT WHAT ENVISIOED WITH THIS FUNDING BUT PUT THAT OUT THERE IN ADDITION TO STRENGTHENING. THE WAYS THAT WE ARE DEPLOYING EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. OUR SECOND BCP IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR WORK ON THE MENTAL HEALTH STUDENT SERVICES ACT IN ESSENCE IT'S TO STRENGTHEN THE STAFFING OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WERE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE COUNTIES FOR MEDICAL STUDENT SERVICES ACT THERE FOR COUNTIES THAT SO FAR HAVE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. I WE'RE WORKING WITH THOSE FOUR COUNTIES THEY FACED JUSTIN. TREMENDOUS STAFFING SHORTAGES AS HAS BEEN THE GUSTS TODAY. TO THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE ON. TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE. IN A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. WE HAVE NOT EXHAUSTED ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT YOU'VE MADE AVAILABLE FOR THEM AND HOW STUDENT SERVICES ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THOSE COUNTIES. WE WILL BE MAKING A- AN ADDITIONAL. COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO ALL COUNTY SO IN ADDITION TO BASE GRANTS THAT HAVE GONE OUT. TO FIFTY FIVE OF THE FIFTY NINE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH. AGENCIES WE WILL BE MAKING ADDITIONAL FUNDS AVAILABLE STATEWIDE TO AUGMENT THE BASE FUNDING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIGHT SO FAR. A. B. C. P. THAT'S IN FRONT OF YOU IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR CAPACITY TO WORK WITH THOSE PARTNERS. TO BUILD OUT THEIR STAFFING MODELS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE KINDS OF PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENTS THEY MAKE IT THEIR MAKING. AND IT TO SUPPORT THE EVALUATION. AND REALLY IMPORTANTLY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO SUSTAINABLY FINANCED THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE WITH THESE ONE TIME FUNDS. SO THAT THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT HAS A LONG TERM. IMPACT ON THE OUTCOMES OF ACHIEVING FOR CHILDREN YOUTH. IN ADDITION TO THOSE TWO TWO. BCPS WE HAVE THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ASKED US. TO APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN OUR STAKEHOLDER CONTRACT FUNDING. WE ARE CURRENTLY RELEASING AN RFP TO PROVIDE STAKEHOLDER ACSI GRANTS ON BEHALF OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. DURING THE COMMISSION'S DISCUSSION AROUND HOW TO MAKE THESE FUNDS AVAILABLE IT'S CURRENTLY SIX SEVEN SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. WE MAKE THOSE FUNDS AVAILABLE IN A THREE YEAR- A TIME FRAMES AT SLIGHTLY OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THEY WERE VERY-CONCERNED ABOUT THE INFLUX OF AFGHAN REFUGEES. AND HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREDIBLE NEED THAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE DIVERSITY OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES THAT WE HAVE. ACROSS THE STATE AND SO ASK ME TO. REACH OUT AND SEE IF THAT WAS AN AREA THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD SUGGEST INCREASING THAT FUNDING AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES. ARE FACING. TREMENDOUS TRAUMA HAS THEY RELOCATE TO THE UNITED STATES. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE HOPING IT'S ENOUGH AND TO BE CLEAR THE FUNDING ISN'T JUST FOR AFGHAN REFUGEES BUT IS THAT CONVERSATION THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED. THAT IS FACING IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ACROSS THE STATE. THE SECOND STAKEHOLDER CONTRACT REQUEST IS FOCUSING ON BRINK MAKE ENSURING THE VOICE OF YOUTH. IS AVAILABLE TO SHAPE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOT JUST IN SACRAMENTO BUT ACROSS THE STATE. AROUND SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH SITE I WANT TO. JUST COMMENT WITH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE AGENDA TODAY- I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN THE PAST AND SO JUST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ELEVATING THE VOICE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THIS WORK THAT THAT WERE SEAT DEFINING THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE IS EXACTLY TO DO THAT IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT'S MY QUICK SUMMARY OF THE FOR PROPOSALS THAT ARE AB. VERY BROADLY THE OVERVIEW IN TERMS OF OUR CHILDREN HEALTH WORK WE'RE WORKING ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH AS YOU AS YOU KNOW. WE'RE WORKING ON YOUTH DROP IN STRATEGIES. AND THOSE TWO PROJECTS TOGETHER ARE DESIGNED TO OFFER A SYSTEM OF CARE THAT IS RESPONSIVE CHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SCHOOL. AND THE SYSTEM OF CARE. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT BE IN SCHOOL OR FOR HOME SCHOOLS MAY NOT BE THE APPROPRIATE VENUE TO SUPPORT THEIR NEEDS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE'RE WORKING ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAM. AND FARTHER DOWNSTREAM- BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION THAT WAS JUST SIGNED. A PROJECT TO FOCUS ON FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. THE IDEA IS TO BUILD OUT A CONTINUOUS SYSTEM OF CARE THIS STARTS IN THE SCHOOLS MOVED INTO THE COMMUNITY IS RESPONSIVE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOP PSYCHOSIS. IN AND SUPPORTS THEM IF THEY'RE NEEDS ESCALATE INTO THE LEVEL OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS BUT THE BASE OF THIS. IS REALLY TO BUILD OUT THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES. I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT THE COMMISSION IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS YEAR TO FIVE POPULATION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE AS RESPONSIVE TO THAT POPULATION. AS WE ARE TO SOME OF THE OLDER POPULATIONS. WHERE'S THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT THIS POPULATION IS MOST AT RISK FOR CHILD WELFARE INVOLVEMENT ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE CAN DO MORE IN TERMS OF PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION. AS YOU HEARD FROM SPEAKERS TODAY. CERTIFIED GREATEST OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FAMILY AND THE SUPPORT AND EMBRACE THEM IN WAYS THAT THEIR NEEDS. WILL BE MET SO THAT THIS NEEDS DON'T ESCALATE OVER TIME. IN ADDITION TO THAT WORK WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON SUICIDE PREVENTION I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT REGARDING THE SUICIDE THE OFFICES THAT PREVENTION. WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN SAYS THAT PREVENTION PLANS WE'RE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT A SCHOOL ASSESSMENTS AND HAVE SCHOOLS TO SUICIDE ASSESSMENTS. WERE WORKING TO FORTIFY THE DATA THAT WE GATHER AND USE THAT WE CAN DO DATA INFORMED DECISION MAKING. IN AS MUCH AS REAL TIME AS POSSIBLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL REGARDING DEBTS THAT ARE THAT ARE ATTRIBUTED TO SUICIDE. AND WE'RE WORKING TO ENHANCE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS WORKING WITH GUN OWNERS AND GUN CLUBS TO TEACH PEOPLE AND CULTURE AND CRITICALLY APPROPRIATE WAYS WAY TO SECURE THEIR FIREARMS. THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE USED. IN A SCENARIO THAT'S ASSOCIATE WITH SUICIDE. WE HAVE OTHER WORK THAT'S GOING ON- I'M I MENTION THIS YEAR TO FIVE CONCERNED ALSO CONCERNED. ABOUT DISPARITIES THE PANDEMIC. RACIAL JUSTICE CHALLENGES WE'RE SEEING A WIDENING OF DISPARITIES ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA YES WE ANTICIPATE THAT OVER TIME AS THOSE DATA COME IN. THAT THEY WILL SUGGEST THAT THIS PERIOD IN TIME WILL. RESULT IN DRAMATIC ENHANCEMENTS OF DISPARITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS WE NEED TO DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO FOCUS ON THOSE. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE'RE CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF EXPANDING OUR NETWORK OF RESOURCES WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ALL CHILDREN THRIVE TO BRING THE CITY'S INTO STRATEGIES. AROUND A WELLBEING FOR CHILDREN. WE HAVE A PROJECT WITH PBS THAT IS- CALDWELL BEINGS WERE REACHING OUT TO OUR LIBRARY PARTNERS. AND OTHER PARTNERS WHO CAN HELP GET THE WORD OUT. THAT'S MY QUICK BROAD OVERVIEW OF THE RANGE OF THINGS THAT THE COMMISSION HAS UNDER WAY TO SUPPORT CHILDREN YOUTH APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE. NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MARNIE SANDVOLD DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR THE MONTEREY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS I WILL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF. MY NAME IS ARNIE SANDOVAL WELL AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BACKING OUT FOR A CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SERVICES IN MARIN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. I'M ALSO A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST SERVING CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND TODAY I'M TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN AN ESSENTIAL PART OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STRATEGIES TO REACHING CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND WILL NEED. TODAY MORE THAN 85% OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIP. AND DEPENDING ON FINANCING AND STAFFING SOME COUNTIES WILL SERVE ALL OF THE SCHOOLS IN THEIR COUNTY. IN MODERATE WE PROVIDE THE FULL CONTINUUM OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. ACROSS THE COUNTY IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE THREE TIERED INTERVENTION MODEL WITHIN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO THIS INCLUDES PREVENTION EFFORTS EARLY INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES DIRECTOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND CRISIS INTERVENTION ON CAMPUS. HERE'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND ELLIE EIGHT IN COMBINATION WITH THE STATE'S RECENT INVESTMENT IN SCHOOLS PROVIDES THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO ALLOW OUR EDUCATORS. TO FOCUS ON THEIR CRITICAL AREA OF EXPERTISE TEACHING OUR CHILDREN. BY BRINGING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN SCHOOLS PROVIDE THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION AND SUPPORT TO BOTH THE EDUCATORS AND THE TREATMENT TO THE STUDENTS. AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES REALLY ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO PARTNER WITH ELLIE EIGHT AND BRING A MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM OF CARE A RANGE OF SERVICES. TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES ENSURING EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CHILD AND YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. IN MONTEREY COUNTY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY CREATE SUCH PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN ELLIE EIGHT AND COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WE'RE BRINGING THOSE CRITICALLY NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATIONS TO THE EDUCATORS ON CAMPUS OR BRINGING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. WE ALSO PROVIDE CRITICAL LINKAGES TO OUR DAUGHTERS SOME OF CARE ENSURING THAT CHILDREN IN YOU CAN ACCESS SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF SCHOOL OR WHEN THERE ARE CASES THAT CROSS OVER TO CHILD WELFARE. OR OTHER CHILD SERVING SYSTEMS. AS PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN BUT HEALTH AND ELEAZAR HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE CRITICAL DURING THIS PANDEMIC. TO ADDRESS THE INCREASING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE NEEDS OF STUDENTS BEGUN BUILDING AND COUNTY IS AN LGBTQ PLUS NETWORK OF THE PERMANENT CARE. THIS APPROACH WHICH IS BEING SPEARHEADED BY OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS BRINGING TOGETHER APRIL HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH OUR LOCAL HOSPITALS SCHOOLS CHILD WELFARE JUVENILE PROBATION BASED BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PURPOSEFULLY ADDRESS AFFIRMATIVE SUPPORT AND CARE. FOR YOU IN A COORDINATED APPROACH. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS ALSO GRATEFUL FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN BUILDING OUT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS THROUGH THE NHS ESSAY. MONTEREY COUNTY HAS BEEN ONE OF THESE RECIPIENTS IN THIS FUNDING IS ALLOWING US IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO FURTHER BUILD OUT AB I ASK AND THE INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM FRAMEWORK IN MANY OF OUR ELLIE EIGHT. INTEGRATING SERVICES ACROSS EDUCATION AND PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REQUIRES A LOT OF WORK UP FRONT. AND IT'S FUNDING IS VITAL TO ACHIEVING THE STATE CONVENTION OF SCHOOLS AS ACCESS POINTS FOR HEALING AND WELL BEING. THIS YEAR THE STATE IS ALSO INVESTING IN BRINGING MANAGED CARE PLANS AS AN ADDITIONAL PARTNER FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. THROUGH SCHOOL BASED HEALTH INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO CREATE ADDITIONAL BRANCHES FROM MANAGED CARE PLANS I'M THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AS IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US TO PROVIDE A FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE KIDS. HOWEVER THESE CHANGES SIT ON TOP OF THEIR ALREADY VOLATILE TIME FOR OUR WORKFORCE. OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE HAS BEEN STRETCHED TO ITS LIMITS THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. WE HAVE HAD TO PUSH THROUGH OUR OWN EXPERIENCES OF TRAUMA AND LOSS WHILE CONTINUING TO FUNCTION AS YOU ALERTS. WE ARE LOSING STAFF. NOT ONLY TO BURN OUT AN IMPOSSIBLE WORKLOAD DEMANDS BUT BECAUSE THERE IS NEW COMPETITION FOR A LIMITED WORKFORCE. WE WOULD STRONGLY URGE EACH HIGH AND THE LEGISLATURE TO PRIORITIZE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY NET. IS A FOCUS OF WORKFORCE INITIATIVES AS WE STRUGGLE TO COMPETE WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE ALSO WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT BECAUSE OUR SECTOR HAS BEEN SO UNDERINVESTED HISTORICALLY. AND DUE TO UNCONSCIOUS BIAS ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE WORKFORCE SALARIES ARE WELL BELOW WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE A LIVING RANGING CALIFORNIA. IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT CHILDREN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHICH SERVES 50% OF THE STATE'S SAFETYNET. INCLUDING COUNTY IS AN ARE CONTRACTED PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING TO INCREASE SALARIES FOR HER STAFF. WE MUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR CHILDREN BEING SERVE BY THE SAFETY NET ARE VALUED AND DESERVE A QUALITY AND EQUITABLY COMPENSATED WORKFORCE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL I WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS LATER. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CHRISTINE HOMESTEAD ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE ORANGE. COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY AND- MY ROLE HERE IS TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON IT- A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT EFFORT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SENSE- TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND HOW IT RELATES TO THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR SEEN RIGHTS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS- SENSE THAT- ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA. AND JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT AND THE FIRST APPLICATION WE RECEIVED WAS A FULL THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE ADDED IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ALLOCATION TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND THE GOAL WAS TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH THAT AND OVER SIX HUNDRED DISTRICTS ENGAGED IN BUILDING THEIR MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ANOTHER INVESTMENT OF FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARSWAS MADE TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS. AND THE NEED FOR LOOKING AT CREATING BETTER SCHOOL CULTURES AND CLIMATES FOR SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND SOMEWHAT THAILAND GROUP OF SCHOOLS AND TWENTY SIX. ACROSS THE STATE REFUSE TO LOOK AT DECREASING SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS FOR MARGINALIZED STUDENTS. AND THEN OUR LATEST ALLOCATION OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND IS REALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD WE LOOK AT. EATABLE TO SUPPORT THE ACADEMIC BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF STUDENTS AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. CALIFORNIA'S WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO ACTUALLY IN BAD SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING INTO A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FRAMEWORK NOW WE SEE OTHER STATES FOLLOWING THAT. BUT WE'VE ALSO NOW ADDED WILL TAKE- ADDED MENTAL HEALTH AS A COMPONENT TO THE NCSS FRAMEWORK THAT NEEDS TO BE EMBEDDED. IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE CHILD. WHAT WE SEE THE OUTCOME DATA THAT WE'VE BEEN GETTING IT SETS TWENTY FIFTEEN IS THAT DEFINITELY WHEN SCHOOLS PUT A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS. IN PLACE IN A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE WE SEE DECREASES. IN SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION AN INCREASING GRADUATION RATES AND A DECREASE AND REFERRALS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION. THAT IS A BIG AND- QUITE A DATA POINT TO LOOK AT IS OUR DECREASES AND REFERRALS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION BECAUSE WITHOUT A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT MANY STUDENTS WHO JUST NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS OUTSIDE OF THE ERROR PREVENTION TIER ONE LEVEL AND COULD BE MITIGATED THROUGH ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS AND SERVICES WITHOUT ME BEING. NEEDING TO BE REFERRED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION NORMALLY STUDENTS ARE REFERRED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION SO THEY CAN GET ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS BECAUSE TEACHERS AND OTHER EDUCATORS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO ACCESS SUPPORTS AND SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS WE SEE OVER AND OVER IN THE SERVICE THAT WE DO IS A NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD THE SINCE THE START WE'RE ALL COMPETING FOR RESOURCES TO GET MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS. YET OUR STUDENTS COME TO SCHOOLS AND THEY NEED THAT SUPPORT WHEN THEY'RE AT SCHOOL WE DON'T KNOW WHAT PROMISE HAPPEN TO THEM THE NIGHT BEFORE AND SOMETIMES THEY SHOW UP WITH THE NEEDS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT DAY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH A STUDENT STUDY TEAM PROCESS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO MORE RESOURCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AT SCHOOLS IS A HUGE NEED AND WHERE WE'RE SEEING THE DATA POINTS IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT A MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT JUST A REFRESHER AT TIER ONE IS PREVENTION AND I KNOW THAT RESONATES WITH OUR BEHAVIOR HEALTH PROVIDERS CHURCH HE WAS TARGETED SUPPORT SO WHEN I'M NOT GETTING WHAT I NEED IN THE CLASSROOM FOR MY ACADEMICS BEHAVIOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH I MADE NEEDED TO. ADDITIONAL SUPPORT POLITICIAN WILL SUPPORT TAKES MORE RESOURCES MORE PEOPLE AND THEN WE HAVE STUDENTS THAT SOMETIMES NEED INTENSIVE SUPPORT AND SO THAT'S A TIER THREE SUPPORT AND AGAIN RESOURCES IN PEOPLE ARE NEEDED FOR THIS SO WE HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT COME INTO THE STATE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT FOR SCHOOLS. CONTINUED FUNDING IS NECESSARY TO CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THE FRAMEWORK AND PROVIDE ALL SCHOOLS WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ATTACH I TEND TO NOT. ONLY THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS BUT ALL ALSO THE BEHAVIOR SOCIAL LEARNING AND MENTAL NEEDS OF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM GOAL CISNEROS WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. GOOD EVENING CHAIRS ARAMBULA AND MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOEL CISNEROS AND I SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE SHEET THE INVITATION TO SHARE DISTRICTS PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CHILD AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVE ADOPTED THROUGH AB ONE THIRTY THREE. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR EARLY EDUCATION G. K. THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE STUDENTS. WITH THE CURRENT WORK FORCE OF OVER THREE THOUSAND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STAFF INCLUDING EIGHT HUNDRED MENTAL HEALTH DISTRICTS PSYCHIATRIC SOCIAL WORKERS. LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IS READY TO ADAPT TO THE EVOLVING SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH LANDSCAPE IN THE RECOVERY PHASE OF THIS PANDEMIC. IN HIS NEWLY PUBLISHED ONE HUNDRED DAY PLAN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SUPERINTENDENT ALBERTO CARBALLO IDENTIFIED MENTAL HEALTH AS A PRIORITY. THE GOAL IS TO CREATE A PLAN THAT WILL UNIFIED DISTRICT CITY AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING AND STAFFING. TO PROVIDE A CONSISTENT EQUITABLE AND BROAD SET OF SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES IN HIGH NEED AREAS. THE FINANCIAL POSSIBILITIES MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STATE'S FOR BILLION DOLLAR INITIATIVE WILL HELP US MAKE GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS MEETING THE SCHOOL. AND I'D LIKE TO IDENTIFY HER WORK CORROBORATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS UNIFICATION. AS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED MOVE TOWARDS MOVES MOVES TOWARDS DEVELOPING A PLAN. TO PRIORITY AREAS REGARDING THE CHILD AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE SERVICE. FIRST LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IN OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS TO BEGIN DEVELOPING MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. THAT WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS BEYOND THE INDIRECT ACCESS GRANTED THROUGH COUNTY OFFICES. IN SECOND NOW IS AN OPPORTUNE TIME TO ENDORSE A COMMON MENTAL HEALTH FRAMEWORK FOR FUNDING IN SERVICE DELIVERY MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVES WILL CHANGE SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING FOR GENERATIONS. YOUR EXAMPLE IS A STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WILL HELP LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IN OTHER DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR ME DIRECT CAN INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP WITH MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOCUSED ON PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. IN ORDER TO FULLY SEE THIS VISION EXECUTED IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT DISTRICTS JOINED THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND ITS DEPARTMENTS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE DESIGN IN ORDER TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS THEY SERVE. ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES OF FOR SUSTAINING EXPANDING AND IMPROVING SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS IN NEED FOR FINANCIAL REFORM. CONSISTENT WITH KALYAN'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS AND FINANCIAL REFORMS LOS ANGELES UNIFIED IN OTHER LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM A FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF MENTAL HEALTH SIMILAR TO PHYSICAL HEALTH. ALLOWING FOR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO INNOVATE AND DELIVER SERVICES AIMED AT KEEPING OUR STUDENTS WELL RATHER THAN JUST HELPING THEM GET BETTER. ONE OPTION IS FOR UTILIZATION CAPITATION PAYMENTS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PREVENTION IN SCHOOLS. IS A PROUD APPROACH ALLOWS CONSISTENT EQUITABLE NEEDED AND TIMELY SERVICES ACROSS OUR DISTRICT. VALUE BASED PAYMENTS IS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FINANCIAL REFORM NEED TO NEEDED TO PRIORITIZE QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS AN IMPENDING NEED TO REPURPOSE AND RETRACT THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TOWARDS A CHILD CENTERED AND PREVENTION FOCUS MODELS CARE. THE CURRENT SYSTEM UNDER INVEST IN PREVENTATIVE MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT SCALE. INSTEAD IT PRIORITIZE ACUTE CARE TIGHTENING INDIVIDUALIZED DIAGNOSIS. I URGE THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND ITS DEPARTMENTS TO KEEP THIS IN MIND. IN CONTRAST LOS ANGELES UNIFIED UTILIZES MULTI TIERED MENTAL HEALTH APPROACHES AND WE JUST HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. ARE ANTI IF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM ADOPTED IN IN IMPLEMENTED THIS COMMON FRAMEWORK TO MAKE INFORMED SYSTEMIC DECISIONS. REGARDING STUDENTS NEEDS AND SERVICES WE WOULD MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN THE RIGHT SETTING WITH THE RIGHT SERVICES WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE AT THE RIGHT TIME. MULTI TIERED MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS PROVIDE A CONTINUUM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ACROSS TIERS OF INTERVENTION FROM UNIVERSAL PREVENTION SERVICES TO INTENSIVE. THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH FINANCIAL STRUCTURE PRIORITIZES INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE PROGRAMS WELL THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM DOES HAVE PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN MOST OF THEM DO NOT PRIORITIZE CHILDREN ZERO EIGHT NOR DO THEY FIND UNIVERSAL SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING. SCREENING OR RESILIENCE SCALABILITY. LENDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION DOLLARS WITH METAL CAL FUNDS A STIGMATIZING APPROACH I HOPE THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE STAY TRUE TO THE SPIRIT OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PREVENTION AND THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INCENTIVES SO THAT CHILDREN. ARE NOT RESTRICTED FROM ACCESSING THE SERVICES THEY NEED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A DIAGNOSIS. WE ASK THAT DISTRICTS BE AT THE CENTER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH MANAGED CARE PROVIDERS AND WE MOVE TOWARDS A UNIFORM FRAMEWORK OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND FUNDING PREVENTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LEADERSHIP IN REFORMING SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ACROSS OUR WONDERFUL STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR HERE FROM FLORIDA WHAT SEN WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND AS YOU SAID I REPRESENT SCHOOL COUNSELORS BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE I REPRESENTED A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST THE SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL NURSES ALL OF US ARE STUDENT OR SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND WE'RE ABOUT A QUARTER MILLION OF US IN OUR SCHOOLS TODAY- WE SHOULD THE LEGISLATORS IN THE MINISTRATION. RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR USE. OUR EFFORTS AND MOST RECENT INVESTMENTS ARTS SUBSTANTIAL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. I COME TO THIS WITH BEING A FORMER TEACHER A FORMER SCHOOL COUNSELOR FORMER MINISTRY- AND WORKING DIRECTLY SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND TO MAKE THINGS WORK IN SCHOOLS- ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT THE PRIMARY INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY. MANIFESTED THROUGH CALIFORNIA'S SAID IT REALLY LOOKS AT STUDENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED OF ALL. READABLE AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE REIMBURSABLE. HOWEVER WE NEED TO TAKE A STRONGER LOOK AT THE VALUE OF INVESTING IN PREVENTATIVE AND PROACTIVE SERVICES AT ALL LEVELS INCLUDING ELEMENTARY. MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT NEARLY EVERYONE LISTENING TO ME NOW PROVIDED THEY WERE EDUCATED IN CALIFORNIA SKILLED SCHOOLS HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED FULLY STAFFED SCHOOL WITH ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IT INCLUDES ALL THE ONES THAT I'VE MENTIONED BEFORE. REPORTS SHOW THAT STATE RATIOS OF SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO STUDENTS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL IN THE OVERALL AVAILABILITY OF MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS IN SCHOOLS WHAT WE RECOGNIZE. THE WORK FORCE ISSUES AND THAT IT WAS TO ADDRESS EARLIER BREAK BY SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN AND OTHERS WE MUST PLAN FOR THE SHORT TERM AS WELL AS A LONG TERM NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN ODER TO MEET THE NATIONAL RECOMMENDED RATIOS FOR SCHOOL COUNSELORS WE WOULD HAVE TO AT LEAST DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL COUNSELORS WORKING IN OUR SCHOOLS. THAT'S AN INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY. FOURTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. AT THE CURRENT RATE. EDUCATED PROXIMALLY TWO THOUSAND SCHOOL COUNTERS EVERY YEAR. SO MY WISH LIST WOULD BE TO HAVE THE C. ISSUES AND YOU SEE SIR ACTUALLY OPEN UP MORE SPACE FOR. A ROLL MANAGE OUR INCREASE OUR PROGRAMS WE HAVE THIRTY EIGHT PROGRAMS AT THIS POINT- COURSE SCHOOL COUNSELOR TRAININGS IN OUR STATE. SO THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO TO UP THAT ARE VERY RAPIDLY IF WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO THAT. WHAT THIS ALSO MEANS IS THAT EVEN IF WE DOUBLE THE NUMBER SCHOOL COUNSELORS AND SOCIAL WORKERS TO MEET THE NATIONAL RATIOS CALIFORNIA'S TO IT RANKS AT THE BOTTOM AS COMPARED TO MOST OTHER STATES IN THE NATION. IN PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS SINCE WE HAVEN'T. REALLY EXPERIENCED THESE FOLKS IT'S LIKE GIVING A TEACHER ONE TEXTBOOK AND THEN SAYING THE CURRICULUM DOESN'T WORK. YOU KNOW SO WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO EXPERIENCE WITH REGARDS TO THESE PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SOUTH BUT IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO HONE IN ON IS THE WORD TRUST. AND WHY I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE IT REALLY MATTERS FOR KIDS IF THEY TRUST INDIVIDUALS IN THE SCHOOLS WHO THEY CAN DISCLOSE AND TALKED TO ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS AND ARE. TRULY THE KEY AND A LOT OF TIMES LIKE SCHOOL COUNSELORS ARE THE ONES THAT WE FORGET WHETHER IT'S TO PEER COUNSELING. SERVICES WHERE BECAUSE MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND OR OTHER KINDS OF THINGS WHERE THEY CAN GET A LITTLE. SUPPORT OR TO THE CLINICAL SETTING AN INTEGRATED SERVICES WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT I ACTUALLY DO DIAGNOSABLE AND TREATABLE TYPES OF THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS- THEY STUDENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE. WITH GETTING HELP WHEN THEY KNOW THEIR FRIENDS KNOW THESE. THIS IS A GOOD RESOURCE FOR THEM TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT ARE ON THEIR MIND- IN A RECENT ACLU REPORT. WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES AND THEY ASK ME TO SPEAK ON THIS IS ACE IT'S THE REPORTS COLLEGE STATED STUDENT MENTAL WELLNESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WAS JUST RELEASED. ABOUT MAYBE TWO WEEKS AGO. BUT IT SAID THAT ONE IN THREE STUDENTS INDICATE THEY COULD BENEFIT FROM MORE SUPPORT FROM SCHOOL COUNSELORS SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS AND SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGISTS IN OUR SCHOOLS. OUGHT THESE. THESE INDIVIDUALS KNOW A BODY OF INFORMATION THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW. OSTLER SPECIFICALLY TRAINED IN THE INTER CONNECTED BITTY AMONG SCHOOL LAW. SCHOOL SYSTEMS LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH AND FAMILY SYSTEMS ALL THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN REGARDS TO HOW WE NAVIGATE A CHILD'S. LEVEL OF NEED AND- AS SAID EARLIER THEY M. TSS IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF HOW WE WORK WITHIN. THE SYSTEMS- SO I THINK WHAT I'LL DO JUST BECAUSE OF THE TIME OF DAY I'M GOING TO JUST GO TO THE CONCLUSION AND- ARE IN WITH SOMETHING A STUDENT SAID THAT REALLY STRUCK ME. AND ARM. AND SHE SAID ONE DAY I WAS STRESSING ABOUT GRADES AND I STARTED CRYING AT SCHOOL. A SCHOOL COUNSELOR SAW ME AND BROUGHT ME INTO HER OFFICE SHE DIDN'T JUDGE ME AT ALL SHE JUST LISTENED IT DEFINITELY WORKED I SAW HER A FEW TIMES. I AM REALLY GRATEFUL MY SCHOOL OFFERED THAT SO. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME TODAY AND I WOULD ENTERTAIN ANY. SUPPORTER QUESTIONS FURTHER. THANK YOU MAX WILL HEAR FROM CHRISTNE'S MERTZ WHO IS THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR CHILD AND FAMILY% SERVICES. PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU SO MUCH TEARS ARAMBULA MCCARTY AND SALAS FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING- THIS UNPRECEDENTED COMMITMENT AND ATTENTION TO CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS SEEN IN THE FIELD IS VERY POSITIVE. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE ENGAGED WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ROLL OUT OF THAT THE INITIATIVE WE PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON EQUITY. IN THE ATTENTION TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF BLACK WHAT NOT. THE AMERICAN LGBTQ YOUTH. WE FEEL LIKE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO MEASURE OUR SUCCESS BY OUR ABILITY TO TRULY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THESE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND WE NEED TO ACT WITH THE URGENCY AS MISTER JACKSON EARLIER SAID AS IF THESE ARE OUR OWN CHILDREN- FIRST OF ALL THE WORK FORCE CRISIS IS REAL YOU'VE HEARD IT FROM MANY OF THE SPEAKERS. OUR MEMBER NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE FACING 2230% VACANCY RATES- WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE PIPELINE FOR A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF. BUT ALSO THE SOME OF THE REGULATORY BARRIERS THAT EXIST ON THE LICENSING PROCESS. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE PARTNERING WITH THE SUPERINTENDENT AND CD AND COSPONSORING S. B. TWELVE H. TWENTY NINE. WE ALSO ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE FOCUS ON SCHOOL BASED PARTNERSHIPS AND THE FUNDING BEING MADE AVAILABLE THE MHSAA M. H. S. S. A. EFFORTS ARE COMMENDABLE THEY RESULTED IN STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ELLIE AS- WE'D LOVE TO SEE MORE DELIBERATE EFFORTS. TO INCLUDE CBO PARTNERS GIVEN THAT THEY'RE OFTEN. THEY'RE OFTEN REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITY IS BEING SERVED. AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR YOU'RE GOING ON THAT AND FINDING WAYS TO DESIGN PROGRAMMING THAT IS MORE INCLUSIVE OF ALL THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- WE ARE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE SCHOOL AND IN SCHOOL BASED SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. BETWEEN DISTRICTS OFFICES OF EDUCATION MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS HOW MANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN CBO'S WE DO THINK THESE ARE GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT WE KNOW THEY'RE GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENTREGIONS AND SO HAVING A ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE THAT ADDRESSES THOSE UNIQUE NEEDS. WILL BE CRITICAL- THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS THAT NEED TO BE BRENT BLENDED AND BRAIDED TO ENSURE THAT THESE SERVICES GET TO THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH AFFECTIVELY. AND THAT WE USE EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE ALSO THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT THE MANY DISTRICTS ARE FACING IS THAT THEY WANT TO SAY THEY WANT TO SEE PROGRAMS- THAT ADDRESS ALL CHILDREN ACROSS. THEIR DISTRICT AND SO WHEN WE SEE DISPARATE- SERVICES. BASED ON WHAT KIND OF INSURANCE A CHILD HAS. THAT'S A PROBLEM- UP ONE OF OUR CURRENT EFFORTS IS A. B. FIVE FIVE TWO WITH THE QUIRK-SILVA- TRYING TO ENSURE THAT COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IS- SUPPORTING EFFORTS AROUND SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH. WE ALSO KNOW AND WE HEARD THIS FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT AS WELL THAT WE MUST PROVIDE SERVICES TO FAMILIES AND STUDENTS WHO MAY BE DISCONNECTED FROM SCHOOL SO HAVING THOSE SERVICES IN COMMUNITIES. ADJACENT TO SCHOOLS WE'RE HAVING FOLKS WHO ARE OUT REACHING TO FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND STEM STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED DURING THAT TIME IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL. HERE BASED SERVICES ARE CRITICAL ALSO TO SERVING CHILDREN YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB EIGHT OH THREE THE PAIR CERTIFICATION BILL AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT. TO REACH STUDENTS. WE ALSO SEE. THIS THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON YOUTH WHO HAVE PERHAPS TRADITIONALLY NOT DONE WELL IN SCHOOL FOSTER USE USE CONNECTED TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE'RE SEEING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THESE SYSTEMS. AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE. SUPPORTING THOSE YOUTH THROUGH THIS CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS HAPPENING AT ONE TIME THAT COORDINATION IS JUST SO ESSENTIAL. THE RENEWED FOCUS ON YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS VERY POSITIVE PARTICULARLY THE INCLUDING THE CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT PILOT FROM DH CS THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES TO BE THE FUNDING FOR ACTUAL SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE. AT BOTH THE OUTPATIENT AND RESIDENTIAL LEVELS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CREATING RATES AND REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROVIDERS THAT MAINTAINS THOSE SERVICES OVER TIME. THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION THAT WE DIDN'T BEEN GAUGED WITH THE STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON- AND WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH SOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS IS BILL. HE WON TWELVE WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THESE EFFORTS UNDER WAY AND AGAIN ANOTHER CRITICAL OFFICE AND- VERY IMPORTANT TO INTEGRATE INTO THIS LARGER INITIATIVE. I'VE SAID IT A FEW TIMES ALREADY BUT I'LL STOP WILL WITH SAYING I'LL AND WAS SAYING COORDINATION COORDINATION COORDINATION IF WE DON'T WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE SYSTEMS BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THE LOCAL LEVELS- WE WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ENSURING THAT WE MEET THAT VISION OF. ALL CHILDREN AND YOUTH ACCESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TENANTS ON A PETAN WHO IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. HELLO GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS JANET SMITH LEVINE AND I AM A CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR DPA DPA IS A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION PROMOTING DRUG POLICIES GROUNDED IN SCIENCE COMPASSION HEALTH AND HUMAN RIGHTS- I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION OF SUBSTANCE USE IN CALIFORNIA AMONG OUR YOUTH AS WELL AS BEING- INTERSECTION WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE WE REACHED AN UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT IN THE OVERDOSE CRISIS AND HAVE LOST OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES IN THE US FROM APRIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO APRIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE ACCORDING TO THE CDC. OVERALL SUBSTANCE USE RATES AMONG YOUTH IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN. INCLUDE 14% FOR THOSE IN SEVENTH GRADE. THIRTY POINT FIVE. PERCENT FOR THOSE IN NINTH GRADE AND FORTY FOUR PERCENT- FOR THOSE STUDENTS AND ELEVENTH GRADE. THESE ARE PRE PANDEMIC NUMBERS AND WE KNOW THAT WITH A PANDEMIC MORE CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. HAS INCREASED MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS INCLUDING INCREASED DEPRESSION SELF HARM ANXIETY. AND HAVE ALSO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE CHILDREN ARE SELF MEDICATING. AS A RESULT EPA HAS WORKED TO CREATE SAFETY FIRST IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS A DRUG EDUCATION CURRICULUM THAT IS SCIENCE AND EVIDENCE BASED WE EVALUATED IN CLASSROOMS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN RELEASED IT PUBLICLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN. IN RESPONSE TO THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE ALSO CREATED A REMOTE LEARNING VERSION- AND HAVE UPDATED THE CURRICULUM- WHICH WAS RELEASED AGAIN BACK IN IN IN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SAFETY FIRST IS COMPRISED OF FIFTEEN LESSONS THAT MEET NATIONAL HEALTH EDUCATION STANDARDS AND COMMON CORE LEARNING STANDARDS EACH LESSON- IS DESIGNED TO BE DELIVERED AND NINTH AND TENTH GRADE HEALTH CLASSES BY A CERTIFIED HEALTH TEACHER. WE SEEN OVER FOUR THOUSAND UNIQUE DOWNLOADS OF THIS PROGRAM SINCE IT WAS FIRST LAUNCHED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND ALMOST EVERY STATE IS REPRESENTED- IN TERMS OF FOLKS AND- INSTITUTIONS DOWNLOADING THIS- CURRICULUM WE HAVE OVER THIRTY SEVEN OUT OF THE FIFTY STATES OUR TOP SPEEDS ARE NEW YORK IN CALIFORNIA- NO SURPRISE AS WELL AS MINNESOTA WHICH IS NUMBER THREE IN OREGON AND PENNSYLVANIA ARE BOTH TIED. FOR FOURTH. SAFETY FIRST IS A IS CURRENTLY TIED IN NINTH GRADE HEALTH CLASSES AT ALL HIGH SCHOOLS IN SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH SERVES MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND THOUSAND STUDENTS. THE CURRICULUM IS UNDER DISCUSSION TO BE USED IN ALL FOUR MARIN COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS- FOR FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SAFETY FIRST IS IN THE- OF HARD REDUCTION WHICH DISCOURAGES YOUNG PEOPLE FROM USING ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS. BUT IT OFFERS MORE THAN ABSTINENCE ONLY APPROACH BECAUSE IT ALSO PROVIDES TEENAGERS WITH INFORMATION TO KEEP THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS SAY IF AND WHEN. THEY TO. IF AND WHEN THEY DO ENCOUNTER THESE SUBSTANCES. FOR EXAMPLE ABSTINENCE ONLY EDUCATION MIL MAY TELL YOUNG PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD REFRAIN FROM USING DRUGS BECAUSE THEY COULD OVERDOSE. HARM REDUCTION EDUCATION HOWEVER EXPLAINS HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS OF DRUG OVERDOSES HOW TO RESPOND AND HOW TO GET HELP IF THEY FEAR THAT A FRIEND IS OVERDOSING. IN ADDITION TO REVEAL FACT WE STRUCK EDUCATION FOR CALIFORNIA'S YEAR WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE TREATMENT THAT INCLUDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT IS NEEDED. THIS MUST BE DONE HOWEVER WITH THE RACIAL EQUITY PERSPECTIVE IN RECENT NATIONAL STUDY FOUND THAT BLACK TEENS WERE 85% LESS LIKELY TO BE PRESCRIBED THIS LIFESAVING TREATMENT AFTER AN OVERDOSE. THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS AND FOR LATINOS THIS NUMBER IS EVEN HIGHER THESE RACIAL DISPARITIES EXIST RESULTS AS WELL. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE YOU SPEAK AT THE TOP OF THE PADDLE THIS EVENING FURTHER CRIMINALIZATION AND STIGMATIZATION DOES NOT PROVIDE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE PROPER SUPPORT OR ACCESS TO TREATMENTS AND SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. ENSURING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE REALITY BASED DRUG EDUCATION ALONG WITH HARM REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE ACCESS TO FEDERAL TESTING STRIPS AND INCREASED. ACCESS TO DRUG EDUCATION IS WHAT'S NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA'S YOUNG PEOPLE- I WILL END MY TESTIMONY AND WILL TAKE. QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE- THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TYLER RANDY WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES. GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TYLER INDIAN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS BARRACKS SUBCOMMITTEES- BUT WE REPRESENTS FIFTEEN THAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA PROVIDING SERVICES THROUGH DRAMATIC HOW AND POPULATIONS IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION- OR RAISE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMITTEES OF INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND OUR DIALOGUE ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. TOO OFTEN I SEE GROUPS USING THE TERM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHEN THEY DO IN BATTLE HOW BEAR HUNT IS INCLUSIVE OF BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE MANY OF THE-YOUTH THAT WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT TODAY A CO WORKER IN MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CONDITIONS. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTTUTE ON DRUG ABUSE PRE PANDEMIC EOPLE ARE MOST LIKELY TO BEGAN USING DRUGS INCLUDING TOBACCO ALCOHOL AND ILLEGAL AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DURING ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG ADULTHOOD. BY THE TIME THAT THEY ARE SENIORS ALMOST 70% AB HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHAT TRIED ALCOHOL HOW WILL HAVE TAKEN AN ILLEGAL DRUG NEARLY 40% HOW WILL HAVE SMOKED A CIGARETTE IN MORE THAN 20% WILL HAVE USE THE PRESCRIPTION DIET DRUG FOR NON MEDICAL PURPOSES. OUR SYSTEM OF DRUG MEDI CAL WAS SET UP FOR ADULTS IN THE SYSTEM TODAY DOES NOT TRANSLATE WELL FOR YOU BUT UNIQUE NEEDS AND TAKE A HOLISTIC FAMILY APPROACH. AS FOR SERVICES TODAY AND OUR MEMBERSHIP- NO THAT DOESN'T BENCH MENTIONED MULTIPLE TIMES PROVIDERS ARE DOWN 34240% OF THEIR STAFF DUE TO THE CAN'T THAT MAKE AND HAVE HAD TO CLOSE OFFICES. BEDS AND SERVICES DUE TO THE AND ABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAIN STAFF WE ARE TO SEE EXCITED TO SEE THAT THE STATE IS DEDICATED TO ITS WORKFORCE AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND THAT IT'S PLANNING TO DO SO MORE IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT WOULD HIGHLIGHT. YOU KNOW THE RENEWED IMPORTANCE AB YOU KNOW FOCUS ON BURKE FORCE- ARM AS FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. GETTING ACCESS TO SCHOOLS IS BURIED YEAH. FOR SUCH USED AS SIR. WE FIND THAT CHOOL ARE COST ABOUT WHO THEY ARE. CAN WITHOUT. CAN SIR. HAVE PAID. TIME REACHING STUDENTS IN MEETING THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT. PART OF THE CHAO. THAT SCHOOL DO NOT PROGRAM THAT COME ON CAMPUS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. TO YOU REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE TYPER INSURANCE PAYER. THIS WAS MENTIONED BY KRISTAN EMERGE WITH THE ALLIANCE- WE ARE- FIND THAT AB FIVE FIVE TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK-SILVA IS AN IMPORTANT SOLUTION SO THAT STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE ACCESS. FROM SERVICES REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE HI. ADDITIONALLY WE FIND THAT- ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES FOR SUBSTANCES ON CAMPUSES. CAN RIP STUDENTS AWAY FROM THEIR SPEAKING OUT OF FOOD I DON'T HELP AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES. OKAY RECEIVE ON CAMPUS ARE LINKED TO CAMPUS AS- WE RECOMMEND NOT FUNDING FOR SCHOOL AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS ALSO BE EXPANDED FOR PARTNERSHIPS FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER SCREENING AND REFERRAL MECHANISMS FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. AND CHILD WELFARE INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AS- I'M SPEAKING FOR A MOMENT ON A JUVENILE JUSTICE. WHILE THE STATE HAS MADE A PERMANENT CHANGES TO REFORM AND REDUCE STRESS YOU CAN BOMB IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. BASIS STORAGE WE HAVE SERVED AS THE PRIMARY PATHWAY INTO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES. AND WIND THESE REFORMS HAVE TAKEN PLACE WE HAVE NOT SEEN A COMMENSURATE UPTAKE OF SERVICES THROUGH OTHER PATHWAYS. WELL WE KNOW THAT THE NEED IS THERE. JUST AS ONE BRIEF EXAMPLE WE DO HAVE A PROVIDER AND OUR MEMBERSHIP THAT HAD A LARGE- USE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM IN L. A. COUNTY. THEY HAD A CONTRACT WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT THAT FELL THROUGH AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THEY WERE- GOT A CONTRACT WITH THE COUNTY SB AGENCY REJECT MATIC CAL. AND THEY SAW THAT THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS DROPPED TO ABOUT 10% OF WHAT THEY WERE WITH THE PROBATION CONTRACT- ADDITIONALLY THE RATES THAT WERE OFF. THROUGH HOW DID MEET THE COST OF. THEY WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED SURE OF WHAT THEY WERE I. YOU KNOW NEEDED TO BE IN ORDER SUSTAIN SERVICE SAYS- WE THAT IN OUR MEMBERS. THE ONLY WAY ASSIST NOT- NEW SERVICE. IS REALLY IF YOU HAVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF ADULTS. BUT HELP TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF CARE FOR YOU CERVANTES- I'M- IN. BABBAGE'S SUMMARIZE AGAIN ABOUT YOU KNOW ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE WORK FORCEAND TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR FINAL TWO PANELISTS ON THIS PANEL ARE YOUTH SPEAKERS WE WILL BEGAN WITH. MEDIA DEL PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. HELLO EVERYONE GOOD EVENING MY NAME SAID JOE I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL FROM ANAHEIM I'M ALSO BOARD MEMBER IN THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. A CO CHAIR ON CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD- AND I USED ALLOW ON THAT ON THE CALIFORNIA CHURCH IN STRONG SUPPORT. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A STUDENT LET'S HOME JOHN. JOHN HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TRANSITION INTO HIGH SCHOOL HE FELT INVISIBLE IN THE HALLWAYS AT THE SCHOOL WITH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY THREE STUDENTS. THE SHIVERING HANDS OF ANXIOUSNESS THE DAILY NAUSEOUS TEMPTATION AND BACKTEST THROUGHOUT LATIN FEEL LIKE DISCUSS THAT THIS LIFE DAY ARE CURRENT RIGHT WHEN THE BELL RINGS. EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL JOHN WALK FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHICH DESTINATION. IT WAS HIS HOME WAS A PLACE WHERE HE SIX COMFORT AND SAFETY THROUGH THE AND LESS HOURS OF TRAINING IS TIRE EYES ON USELESS TV SHOWS. LUCKILY THINGS STARTED TO GET BETTER. KITANA COMMITTEE CANCER WHO CARES ABOUT HIM A GROUP OF TRUST THE CLASSMATES WHO PROVIDE MENTAL SUPPORT. HE FELT VISIBLE ONCE AGAIN. THE CHARACTER NAMED JOHN WHO STRUGGLE WITH DEPRESSION THE STORY WAS ME WE HAD TO DO MY EXPERIENCES I SAW THAT ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES IS THE GENERATIONAL GAP BETWEEN STUDENTS TRYING TO ACCESS CARE. THE MENTAL PROFESSIONALS. IF YOU LOOK AT. AT IT THROUGH THE MICROSCOPIC LEVEL THE FOUNDATION OF BOXING CARRIS TRUST THAT'S THE CORE COMPONENT THE CORNERSTONE. WHEN IT COMES TO CRISIS STUDENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO REACH OUT TO THEIR FRIENDS FOR MENTAL SUPPORT BROTHERS TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT HOME OR AT WHAT HAPPENS TO THEIR RELATIONSHIPS RIGHT. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT USE AND PEERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO TALK TOPIC USED WHEN THEY FACE THE STRESS RATHER THAN ADULTS TEACHERS OR COUNSELORS. I REALLY GET COLD I SAW FROM HELEN A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT FROM SOUTH IN CALIFORNIA QUARTET- PROGRAMS ARE A GREAT SOURCE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO FEEL SCARED TO APPROACH AN ADULT FOR HELP FOR MANY OF US THERE'S A BARRIER. THAT CAN FELT BETWEEN US AND SOMEONE ELSE FROM DIFFERENT GENERATIONS. THUS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION THE MEN'S HEALTH WORKER SHORTAGE IN THE FIELD AS A HUGE PROBLEM SO HAVING KIDS ARE PROGRAMS DIRECTLY PROVIDES PROVIDING SERVICES IN SCHOOLS CAN HELP TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. BE THE EFFECTIVE REFERRAL SYSTEM BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND DISTRUST AND THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THE BRIDGE THAT BINDS A GENERATIONAL GAP. WITH THE END OF THE TIER ONE AND TWO. IN THE NCSS MODEL TO FACILITATE A SCHOOL CULTURE THAT'S MORE LIKELY TO ACCESS CARE AND BRIDGE THE GAP. ANOTHER BENEFIT ABOUT KICKED HERE IS THAT IT PROMISES SUSTAINABLE THE RESULTS ESPECIALLY FOR A ONE TIME FUNDING. NOW IMAGINE HOW SUSTAINABLE FACTOR INTO INTO THE QUESTION RIGHT SENIORS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THEY CANNOT YOU KNOW TRAIN THE NEXT GENERATION OF- SOPHOMORES AND JUNIORS AND POTENTIALLY EVEN FRESHMAN RIGHT. AND PASSED THE CYCLE OF CARE WITHIN THAT SCHOOL CLIMATE SCHOOL CULTURE CONTINUES ON. THIS ESURES THE MENTAL HEALTH CULTURE IS MAINTAINED AND SUPPORTED BY THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF YOUNG ADULTS IN OTHER WORDS IT'S NOT A ONE TIME FUNDING. IT IS THE PRESIDENT'S INVESTMENT THAT CALIFORNIA CAN SET. TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF YOUNG ADULTS. NOW THE SCHOOL HAS MORE MONEY TO SPEND EDITORS THE BASIC WAYS IF THEY'RE NOT INVESTING AND SUSTAINABLE STRATEGY STRATEGIES LIKE KIDS GUNS. DO COMMUNITIES SCHOOL INITIATIVES THE STATE APPEARS TO BE PURSUING A STUDENT CENTER MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. BUT WHY STOP THERE SO THE NEXT QUESTION TO ASK SO WHAT WILL THE STATE DUE TO INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE STUDENT CENTERED INITIATIVES SUCH AS PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS NOT JUST HOW OFTEN AT THE CENTER OF CARE. BUT ALSO AT THE CENTER OF ENGAGEMENT ALLOWING THEM TO BE. A CHANCE TO HELP OTHERS. GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN ADVOCATE AND DARK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM- SIR REYA CHILLA ANOTHER YOU SPEAKER. THANK YOU AND GOOD EVENING I'M SORRY I CHIRLA AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE SPEAKING WITH YOU ALL TODAY I'M A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR IN SAN DIEGO AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIR OF THE YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH. A YOUTH CRISIS COUNSELOR THE- NEW CRISIS LINE AND A MEMBER OF A LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION THAT PARTNERS WITH MY SCHOOL TO ASSESS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND IN RESPONSE DEVELOP PROGRAMS DIRECTLY ON CAMPUS THE ANSWER TO THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS. SO ADDING ON TO MIA ANOTHER BENEFIT OF PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS AND SOMETHING THAT IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. IS THAT PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS AREN'T LOW COST AND HIGH EFFICIENCY. IT'S CHEAPER TO PAY STIPENDS FOR STUDENTS THAN FULL SALARIES OR OTHER EXPENSES AND EFFICIENCY COMES FROM YOU UNDERSTANDING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GROW UP IN AN ERA OF SOCIAL MEDIA THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER NEW DEVELOPMENTS DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAKE YOUTH MORE LIKELY TO TURN TO OTHER YOUTH FOR HELP. KRISTAN EMERGE WITH THE ALLIANCE MENTIONED BEFORE SB EIGHT OH THREE WHICH IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD IN THE PEER TO PEER WORLD BUT NEEDS TO BE FOLLOWED UP WITH MORE LEGISLATION. THAT INCLUDES YOUTH UNDER EIGHTEEN AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE. THING ELSE I DO WANT TO TOUCH ON IS THAT AT MY SCHOOL AND I'M SURE MANY OTHERS AWARENESS IS NOT THE PROBLEM. WE GENERALLY KNOW WHAT MENTAL HEALTH IS AND HOW TO IDENTIFY WHEN WE NEED HELP BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT HELP DOESN'T EXIST DIRECTLY ON CAMPUS. SOME OF MY FRIENDS SEE THERAPIST OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL BUT THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. THERE P. IS EXPENSIVE FOR MANY PEOPLE AND A LOT OF MY PARENTS HAVE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS HAVE PARENTS THAT DON'T BELIEVE MENTAL HEALTH IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE OF CULTURAL STIGMA. THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE PEER TO PEER IS ONE OF THE BEST SOLUTIONS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEER TO PEER PROGRAMS I AND MANY OF MY PEERS. THAT I'VE TALKED TO ENVISION A STUDENT STRUGGLING WITH LET'S SAY THE PANDEMIC CREATING A LOT OF ANXIETY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT TOO UNCOMMON RIGHT NOW. THAT STUDENT CAN WALK INTO A DESIGNATED ROOM DIRECTLY ON THEIR CAMPUS. INSIDE THE ROOM WOULD BE SEVERAL CARE COUNSELORS WERE JUST OTHER STUDENTS FROM THAT SCHOOL WHO'VE UNDERGONE RIGOROUS TRAINING IN MENTAL HEALTH. THE STRUGGLING STUDENT CAN TALK TO ANY OF THE PEER COUNSELORS IN A CONFIDENTIAL CONVERSATION. ONE MODEL THAT WE FOUND PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IS FROM AN ORGANIZATION CALLED SOURCES OF STRENGTH WHICH TRAINS THE PEER COUNSELORS TO SUGGEST RELEVANT RESOURCES AND HEALTHY COPING METHODS TO THE STRUGGLING STUDENTS. I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING THIS CORRECTLY BUT AS ASSEMBLY MAN SEYARTO TOUCHED ON IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER MORE PREVENTION BASED PROGRAMS. WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON PEER TO PEER IS SO EFFECTIVE. SINCE CAN COME IN FOR WHAT THEY SEE AS MINOR PROBLEMS JUST TO TALK IT OUT. SINCE MOST MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES DON'T DEVELOP AT FULL SEVERITY AT THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE WHEN YOUTH ARE GOING THROUGH CHALLENGES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL. GRAMS CAN TACKLE THE ISSUE BEFORE IT BECOMES CRITICAL SO WE'RE NOT CHASING THE PROBLEM AFTER THE FACT. IT'S ALL RESPONSIBILITIES TO SET UP THE NEXT GENERATION WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL AND IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. THE END I AND MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE FIRMLY BELIEVE PEER TO PEER PROGRAM SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FUTURE BUDGET AND IN FUTURE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I AGAIN WANT TO EXTEND A SPECIAL APPRECIATION TO THE YOUTH SPEAKERS BOTH TO DNIA AND- SHARIAH IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CENTER OURSELVES AROUND. THE STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES AND APPRECIATE THE VOICE THEY HAVE HELPED TO BRING HERE TODAY. AS THIS IS THE CONCLUSION OF PANEL THREE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIR TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND PARDON THE LATE HOUR BUT IT IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DIG INTO A LITTLE BIT OF DETAILS. AND SO I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR BOTH DIRECTOR MELISSA STAFFORD JONES AS WELL AS JC COOPER. BECAUSE YOU WERE REALLY CLEAR ABOUT SAYING THAT WE NEEDED TO DEFINE GOALS AND TO STAND THEM UP OVER TIME AND BE INTENTIONAL THAT I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND AT THE OUTSET WHICH METRICS WE WILL BE EVALUATING THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. HOW AND WHEN WILL WE BE ABLE TO MEASURE THIS PROGRESS STAFFORD JONES. AND SO WE ARE IT. IT'S A SORT OF A STAGE PROCESS SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO DEFINE THE OUTCOME AREAS THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT I DESCRIBED. AND THEN YOU ARE CORRECT THE NEXT STEP AFTER THAT ONCE WE DEFINE THE AREAS OF OUTCOMES WHERE WE ARE. VIV'S TURN DESIGNATE BASED ON ENGAGEMENT WITH A RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH OVER THE FIVE YEARS. YOU'RE RIGHT WE WILL THEN NEED TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC METRICS THAT BUILT THOSE OUT SO WE CAN TAKE A RESULTS BASED ACCOUNTABILITY APPROACH SO OUR OUR TENTATIVE PLAN IS TO ESTABLISH SORT OF BAD. A TECHNICAL COMMITTEE ONCE WE HAVE THOSE OUT CUTS AREAS BETTER DEFINED TO STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. WHO ARE. AND WHAT SPECIFIC METRICS WE SHOULD USE THE ALSO AS I MENTIONED HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION AND WE WILL BE SECURING AN EVALUATION PARTNER WITH EXPERTISE IN BATH. AND EVALUATION AND SO WE WILL ALSO BE INTO THEIR EXPERTISE TO HELP US FINALISE WHAT THOSE SPECIFIC METRICS EVEN IF THEY ARE TRULY THINGS THAT WE CAN MEASURE OVER TIME. THANK YOU FOR ANSWER I LOOK FORWARD TO THE LEGISLATURE- ALSO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT THE METRICS ARE- WE AGREE UPON WHAT IT IS THAT WE ARE MEASURE. I'D LIKE TO ASK THE NEXT QUESTION OF GC COOPER AS HE WENT THROUGH SEVERAL- TIMELINES AND DATES BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO FOCUS ON THAT HE CALLED COUNSELED. PLATFORM THAT WAS MENTIONED AS AN INITIATIVE. AS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN WE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GET ONLINE AND ACCESS SERVICES. THROUGH THIS PLATFORM AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE CLARITY ON THAT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO. SO WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THE PROCESS OF. FINDING A VENDOR WHO CAN STAND UP THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM- IN THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM AS WELL AS YOU KNOW STUDENTS YOUTH FAMILIES WILL BE ABLE TO ENGAGE TO RECEIVE SERVICES- INCLUDING. THROUGH THAT SAME PLATFORM FOR A COMPLIMENTARY WHEN THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING OUT WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE WILL BE. MULTIPLE PROCUREMENTS WITH LINKAGES TO SYSTEMS OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE A ONE LARGE SYSTEM WHO CN DO MUCH OF THIS- BUT THERE WILL BE AN EASY CONSUL. FOR PROVIDERS SO TWO DIFFERENT PARTS RIGHT THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM WILL OFFER DIRECT SERVICES IT WILL HAVE A NETWORK OF PROVIDERS PEER TO PEER GROUP- THERAPY THERE WILL BE INDIVIDUAL THERAPY AVAILABLE ON IT WILL TEAR OUT AND NOW THEY'LL BE A WARM HAND OFF TO ME AS CARE PLANS. ARE SEPARATE APART PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO USE AN ECON SALT SYSTEM THROUGH THAT PLATFORM TO GET ADDITIONAL CONSOLE AS SERVICES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THOSE THINGS WILL LINK UP WITH IN THE DAY YES- YOU KNOW OUR PLATFORMS THAT EXIST OUT THERE- AT THIS TIME- AND WILL CONTINUE TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH THAT. WE ARE ANTICIPATING A CURRENT GOAL IS THAT THOSE WOULD BE OUT BY JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM IT IS- IN TIED THERE THAT'S THE SAME TIMELINE JUST TO CONNECT WITH THE SEPARATE KIND OF STATE WIDE. A LINKAGE TO SCHOOL BASED REIMBURSED SERVICES THAT WOULD BE GOING LIVE WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A LIST OF BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SITE AT SCHOOL SITES TO BE REIMBURSED BY ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA NOT JUST MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS BUT- ALL. MANAGED CARE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE FOR A SET OF SERVICES ONSITE AT SCHOOLS- AND THEY WOULD BE IF THE SCHEDULE TIED TO THAT BOOK PH YES INDIA MAKES THE ARE PARTNERING THAT EFFORT. ALL OF THOSE ARE CURRENTLY TARGETED FOR JAN ONE OF TWENTY FOUR THAT'S HELPFUL I DO TRY TO LINK THOSE. PIECES APART BECAUSE IT'S IMPROPER TO GATHER BECAUSE THE VIRTUAL CLASS. IS FOR. YOU HAVE THE CONSOLE THERE YOU ALSO HAVE THE CBO. FOR FAMILIES AND YOUTH THAT WOULD BE A PART OF THAT IN AND THAT VIRTUAL PLATFORM. AND THEN SEPARATE APART YOU HAVE THE SCHOOL BASED SERVICES LINKAGES AND P. SCHEDULE ALL KIND OF LAUNCHING AT THE SAME TIME. AND THE LAST PART OR ALL CONNECT FOR PEOPLE IS REALLY ON THE PART WHERE DCS WILL BE ENGAGING WITH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PROVIDERS STATEWIDE. INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS AND OTHERS AS WELL AS SCHOOLS ON THE TRAINING FOR THAT PLATFORM SO THEY KNOW HOW TO TELL PEOPLE HOW TO ACCESS THOSE SERVICES. ON THIS WOULD BE LEADING UP PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH OF THAT VIRTUAL PLATFORM SO THEY KNOW HOW TO REFER PEOPLE. THEY KNOW THEY CAN SAY WHAT IT OFFERS AND WHAT IT DOES AND IT WILL PHASE OUT OVER TIME AND SO. THOSE ARE KIND OF THE VARIOUS PIECES THAT WILL BE TIED TO THAT G. AND ONE OF TWENTY FOUR. OF COURSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO SO THAT SOME POINT IF THAT CHANGES THE FUTURE OF COURSE WITH COMMUNICATE THAT BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING AND ENGAGING TWO. OF THOSE PIECES UP AND RUNNING FOR JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY FOUR. I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON A POINT YOU JUST MADE ABOUT REIMBURSING OF SERVICES THAT- WILL BEGIN THEIR AS I. BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE PARITY AS THE INITIATIVE IS FOCUSED. ON A SYSTEM FOR ALL KIDS REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS OR PAYER. AND SO GIVEN THAT YOU SAID THAT THESE EARLY YEARS ARE REALLY BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEM BEFORE WE'RE- GETTING REIMBURSED. I'D LIKE TO ASK IS THE STATE CURRENTLY PARTNERING WITH PRIVATE COMMERCIAL INSURERS. AND MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN OTHER WORDS ARE THE PRIVATE SECTOR. DOLLARS SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE. AND IF NOT WHY NOT. ALSO KERN- THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING WITHIN THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS. IS FUNDED VIA GENERAL FUND THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU- I THINK THAT THE ONE PLACE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS PRIVATE PAYERS AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. THEY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REIMBURSING FOR THOSE SERVICES BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES AVAILABLE ON SCHOOLS GUIDES IN INCLUDING HIGHER EDUCATION. SO THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THOSE SERVICES HOWEVER AT THIS TIME OTHER VIRTUAL PLATFORM IS FUNDED. THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS WITHIN THE BUDGET. I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT VIRTUAL PLATFORM WILL BE USED BY ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR PAYER STATUS AND- I STILL. BELIEVE THOSE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PLANS HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. TO BE ABLE TO HELP US TO BUILD THAT OUT TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PARITY. AMONGST ALL CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN AND SO I WOKE. UP COME BACK TO THAT IF I CAN. I'LL NOW FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITY IF I CAN FOR THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS ON PAGE TWENTY ONE OF THE AGENDA. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS I'M TRYING TO. GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO HOLD THOSE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO ENSURE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON KIDS. SO I'M TRYING TO. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS CAN BE TRACKED AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE GAINED OR ACCOMPLISH IN THE ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS. FOUR SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ROBUST- UP WITH A SET OF METRICS AND WE DID EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT FOR VERY LONG TIME WORKING WITH- BOTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS- SCHOOL SITES I'M AS WELL AS MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DEVELOP THE METRICS THE ONLY DRAW IN THAT PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCE THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING- WHERE PLANTS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING TO EXECUTE THEIR- THEIR PLAN. THE ONLY RECEIVED FUNDING IF THEY MEET THE METRICS SO IF THEY MEET ONE OF THE METRICS OF FUNDING YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S TELEHEALTH SERVICES WITHIN A- A SCHOOL SITE- OR IMPLEMENTING ONE OF THE INITIATIVES THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY DRAW DOWN THOSE FUNDS SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO A REPORT OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE OF. ALL MEASURES AND METRICS THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE MET IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SCHOOL- I DISTRICTS THE INDOOR EDUCATION OFFICES WHERE THEY HAVE MADE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS TAKE PLACE- AND- FOR. TOBY DURING SAKE- THE NEXT QUESTION AFTER THIS ONE WILL BE COMING TO YOU BUT WANTED TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. IF I COULD- HOW OF YOUTH DROP IN MODEL AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP IT TO. EASILY BUILD MEDICAL AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN HELP TO PROVIDE SOME. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON THAT FRONT. I'M HAPPY TO OFF LINE UP WITH SOMEONE WHO'S TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD THAT ACCOUNTS GOING TO DEPEND ON. THE TYPE OF SERVICES THAT ARE THAT THEY ARE BUILDING AND MAKING SURE IT'S- IT'S COVER BOTH SO HAPPY TO OFFLINE WITH THEM AT ANY TIME TO AND PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF COURSE. HI WALDRON FOLLOW UP WITH TO REVIEWING INTO- GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF SOME OF THOSE COMPLEXITIES AND HOW WE CAN CREATE A LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FINANCING FOR THIS. AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN BOTH SPEAK TO MEDIC CAL AS WELL AS- HOW WE CAN ENSURE THE INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION FROM OUR PRIVATE COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS. HOPING YOU COULD COMMENT. YES THANKS VERY MUCH THE M. YEAH WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT SO MANY OF OUR SERVICES ARE REALLY DESIGNED BASED ON FINANCE NOT BASED ON NEEDS. AND THERE'D AND THAT FINANCES REALLY DRIVEN BY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDING MANTA CAL RIGHT AND IT'S A LESSONS FROM THE INTERNATIONAL MODEL REALLY GET TO THE ISSUE OF UNDERSTANDING IF WE WANT TO. TRULY SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE. CAN BE PICKY SO TO SPEAK RIGHT THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY DESIGN OUR SERVICES AROUND THEIR NEEDS SO THE MODEL OUT OF AUSTRALIA THE HEAD SPACE MODEL THAT THAT ALL COMES BUILT OFF OF. IT THE UNIQUENESS ISN'T THAT CONNECTS IT INTO THE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE THE UNIQUENESS IS THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE A LOW BARRIER OR IDEALLY NO BARRIER ACCESS TO CARE WHAT WE SEE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IS THERE NOT ROUTINELY COMING IN FOR CARE PARTICULARLY. IF THEY'RE EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS OR OTHER KINDS OF CHALLENGES. SO BY REMOVING BARRIERS MUST INCLUDE. CREATING SIMPLE WAYS TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE THAT DON'T REQUIRE. THE INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVING TO WALK THROUGH IT YOU KNOW AN ENROLLMENT PROCESS. RIGHT AND SO. SO THE ISSUE ISN'T SO MUCH AROUND. HOW CAN WE TAKE AN EXISTING MEDICARE L. FUNDING STREAM AND TEACH PROVIDERS TO BILL MEDICARE I'LL THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE- DESIGN A STRATEGY WHERE MEDIC HAL COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MANAGED CARE PLANS. ALLOW PROVIDERS TO REALLY PRIORITIZE SERVICES FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THAT WERE SERVING WE SEE THIS IN CONVERSATIONS. IN THE IN THE DEEPER INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I L. A. COUNTY DIRECTOR JOHN SHARON TALKS ABOUT. IF I COULD SPEND MORE TIME SERVING PEOPLE AND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN WE COULD DO A FUNDAMENTALLY BETTER JOB AT A LOWER COST FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRYING TO SIR. SO WITH ALL CO WE'RE ALREADY EXPERIENCING CHALLENGES WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO DESIGN. TO IT TO HAVE FIDELITY TO THE MODEL. THAT WHEN A YOUNG PERSON WALKS IN WHETHER IT'S A SORE KNEE. A VACCINE FOR DEALING WITH DEPRESSION THAT THEY GET THE SERVICE ON THE SPOT IT ISN'T A REFERRAL COME IN I CAN DEAL WITH A SORE KNEE. BUT THE DEPRESSION YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT THREE WEEKS AND YOU MIGHT HAVE TO BE SENT TO THE SHOP DOWN THE STREET. IT'S THE IDEA OF BUILDING A SITE THAT IS. IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE DOUBLE TO A YOUNG PERSON AS DESIGNED FOR BUILT FOR AND STRUCTURED TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR NEEDS REGARDLESS OF WHO THE PARRIS SITE SO AS MUCH AS WE- WHAT WHAT THIS PROJECT IS REALLY. IT FROM FROM THE COMMISSION PROTECT WHAT THIS PROJECT IS DOING IS REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING TO TAKE FOR US T BE ABLE TO DESIGN SERVICES AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS THAT WILL BE RESPONSIVE NOT JUST IN THE COMMUNITY BUT IN THE SCHOOLS. BECAUSE THE YOUNG THE BECAUSE THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE BOTH IN THE SCHOOLS AND IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO I'M THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A FEW YEARS OF- INCENTIVE FUNDS FROM THE STATE AND WE'RE- WE'RE- VERY EXCITED TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AROUND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE FUNDS TO UNDERSTAND. HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND PART OF THAT IS RECOGNIZING HOW THE ALL CO GET DROP IN SERVICES MAY ACTUALLY REDUCE LOWER REDUCE THE OVERALL COST OF CARE TO BOTH MEDICARE L. AND PRIVATE INSURANCE IN WAYS THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO BUILD IN. IN THE FISCAL INCENTIVES INTO THE MODEL ITSELF SO THAT THOSE PAYMENT SYSTEMS ARE RESPONSIVE IN WAYS THAT- AGAIN IF WE DON'T MAKE THIS EASY TO DO IT WON'T SCALE. THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO IN TERMS OF FINANCING I HOPE THAT WAS A LITTLE RAMBLING BUT DOES CLEAR UP. ALONG THOSE LINES AND FOCUSING ON SCALING CAN WE COMMENT CURRENTLY ON HOW THE EXISTING SITES WERE CHOSEN. AND IS THERE A HOPE THAT WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET TOWARDS EITHER INLAND CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY OR- RURAL REGIONS OF OUR STATE AND- IS IT RELATED TO THE- WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER THAT IT'S BASED ON FINANCE AND NOT ON. NEED OR IS THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASON FOR WHY THE SITES THAT WE CURRENTLY CHOSEN ARE THE ONES WE HAVE. THANK YOU SO- THERE ARE TWO. WITH THE TO THE SITE SO WE HAVE FIRST SANTA CLARA IS FUNDING THEIR OWN TO SITES WITH IMAGES A INNOVATION FUNDS. AND THEY- ELECTED TO INVEST ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO LAUNCH TWO SITES- ONE OF THE SITES IS STRUGGLING WITH SOME CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE BUILDING THAT IT'S IN AND THAT AND THE COUNTY IS EXPLORING WHETHER NOT THEY NEED TO RELOCATE THAT SITE. THE COMMISSION HAS USED A STATEMENT TO SAY FUNDS TO FIND FIVE LOCAL PARTNERS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. AND WE'RE TALKING WITH SOME ADDITIONAL COUNTIES THAT ARE INTERESTED. IN PARTICIPATING USING LOCAL DOLLARS- AGAIN PART OF OUR- EXCITEMENT ENTHUSIASM FOR THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE FUNDS WHERE THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHT THAT USE DROP INS WAS A POTENTIAL PRIORITY AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A PROCESS TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO GO THROUGH TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS FOR INVESTMENT- THE EXCITING THING ABOUT OUR PARTNERS IS THEY INCLUDE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BUT THEY ALSO INCLUDE HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND IN ONE CASE THE UNIT I UC CAMPUS. WHERE IN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE WORKING TO BUILD OUT A HUB OF WHICH THE ALCOVE SITE WOULD BE PART OF A CAMPUS OF SERVICES SO WHAT WE REALLY LIKE ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF LOCAL PARTNERS WHO EACH PARTY'S WHO ALL CAME TO THE TABLE WITH PERMISSION AND SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT IS THE DIVERSITY OF WHO THOSE PARTNERS ARE ALLOWS US TO REALLY TEST THE MODEL AND EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES TO LEVERAGE. NOT JUST FISCAL RESOURCES BUT THE CAPACITY AND THE ABILITY TO OUTREACH SO IN THE CASE OF THE UNIVERSITY WORKING WITH COLLEGE AGE COLLEGE INTERESTED STUDENTS BECOMES IMPORTANT BUT EACH SITE REGARDS WITH THE PARTNER IS REQUIRED TO SERVE ALL YOUTH. WHO WALK IN THE DOOR. I GUESS JUST FOLLOWING UP- IT WAS A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS WHERE THERE ARE NO APPLICATIONS FROM INLAND COUNTIES OR- IT IT'S- JUST WANTING TO. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A BROAD RANGE OF COUNTIES PARTICIPATING AND SEEING IF THERE'S ANY HURDLES THAT- GOOD QUESTION- I WILL HAVE TO GET I BELIEVE WE FUNDED ALL OF THE APPLICANTS THAT. SUBMITTED BUT I WILL CONFIRM BECAUSE I'M NOT A WAS SET ASIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE FUNDING. FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE STRATEGY AND REQUIRED OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PARTNERS TO OFFER THAT STRATEGY TO THE EXISTING. FIVE THAT WE'RE FINDING AND THREE ADDITIONAL SITES SO WE'VE OPENED THE DOOR FOR OTHER COUNTIES. TO JOIN THE LEARNING COLLABORATIVE. IN AGAIN AGAIN WE WOULD- THE COMMISSION WOULD WELCOME THE USE OF IMAGES TO INNOVATION FUNDS OR ANY OTHER LOCAL SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT WERE AVAILABLE BUT PART OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE WITH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHETHER PART OF THAT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. COULD BE USED TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THANK YOU MY NEXT TO AN FINAL QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL WILL GO FOR- DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I BELIEVE MARIA A CHOLA- YOU HAD STATED THAT THE TARGET FOR THE OVERDOSE CAMPAIGN IS SIXTEEN YEARS AND OLDER AND FOR THE FUNCTIONAL CAMPAIGN IT'S- TWENTY ONE YEARS AND OLDER AND YET. FROM THE DPA EARLIER TODAY. WE HEARD THAT 14% WERE- USING BY SEVENTH GRADE AND 30% BY NINTH GRADE THAT I'D LIKE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF I CAN. IS THERE EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT WE NEED TO START WITH YOUNGER KIDS WHO ARE ENGAGING IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING OVERDOSES AND- USING FENTANYL WITHOUT KNOWING IT AND- SHOULDN'T. OUR CAMPAIGNS THAN BE FOCUSED ON A YOUNGER AGE THAN WE HAVE THUS FAR. SO IT MAY DIFFER TO SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THIS BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT PART OF THESE CAMPAIGNS WE WILL BE USING AND- AS I MENTIONED WILL BE USING A CONTRACTOR TO COME IN AND EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IN THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT GAPS. AB BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ROBIN LIKE IF YOU HAVE SOME MORE OR STACY INFORMATION OUT ON THIS ONE. I THIS IS ROBIN CHRISTIANSEN WITH THE SUBSTANCE AN ADDICTION PREVENTION BRANCH AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. SO YES ABSOLUTELY CORRECT WE HAVE THE DATA WE HAVE THE SAME DATA REPORTED FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES ON. DRUG ABUSE AROUND AGE OF ONSET OF SUBSTANCE USE AND THAT RANGES ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES ALCOHOL CIGARETTES. CANNABIS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND OPIOIDS SO ONE OF THE TARGETS OF THIS CAMPAIGN IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND OPIOID USE AND ALSO BETTER KNOWN THAT IS DUE IN PART TO THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING WHICH THEY OPEN RIGHT SETTLEMENT FUNDS. BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT BOTH THE BURDEN OF OVERDOSE DEATHS AND THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AND THOSE NUMBERS WERE USED TO HELP TO FORM THE BASIS OF THOSE NUMBERS. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO WHAT MARIA HAS SAID THERE WILL BE A STAGE OF FORMATIVE RESEARCH IN WHICH WE WILL BE. CITING DEEPLY INTO BOTH THE DATA THAT ARE AVAILABLE BILL THROUGH SURVEY DATA AND ALSO INFORMATION THAT COMES DIRECTLY FROM FOCUS GROUPS SURVEY INFORMATION OUTSIDE IRAQ THAT WILL HELP TO INFORM THE AGE RANGE THAT WE WILL BE TARGETING WITH THE CAMPAIGNS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND IF I HAVEN'T DONE ONE GIVEN HOW FIVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND IT'S RELATED TO YOUR BIO SENSE PROPOSAL I- WAS PARTICULARLY DRAWN TO THIS PROPOSAL AND ONE UNDERSTAND WHY SO FEW HOSPITALS CURRENTLY ARE PARTICIPATING. AND REPORTING OF THE REPORTING DATA. ARE THEY NOW OR WILL THEY BE REQUIRED TO REPORT AND HOW DID CALIFORNIA GETS TO BE SUCH AN OUT LIAR IN THIS REGARD. HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION. THAT IS A TOUGH QUESTION AND I'M NOT EQUIPPED TO ANSWER MUCH OF THAT I CANNOT SPEAK FOR WHY HOSPITALS HAVE NOT CHOSEN TO ADOPT THE BIOSENSOR ASTON GERMAN SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM I PROBABLY I WILL SAY THAT CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE MANDATORY MANDATED REPORTING ALREADY WITH IN OUR STATUTE. AND BIOSENSORS NOT A MANDATED PROGRAM IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OPTIONAL THE HOSPITALS CAN OPT INTO AND CALIFORNIA IS A LARGE STATE WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HEALTH SYSTEMS SO. IN THE DEFENSE OF OUR HOSPITALS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS I WOULD SAY IT IS A BIT EASIER FOR SOME STATES TO ONBOARD ON TO THE CLASS AND SYSTEM THAT IT IS FOR CALIFORNIA UNDERSTANDING IS CALIFORNIA'S THE LAST STATE TO. IMPLEMENT AND GET ON TO BIOSENSING THAT CURRENTLY. WORK LESS THAN FIFTY HOSPITALS OUT OF OVER THREE HUNDRED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN OUR STATE WHO ARE. ON THIS PILE SENSE PROPOSALS AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET FROM. WHERE WE ARE TODAY TO FULL REPORTING FROM OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. AS I BELIEVE IT WILL THEN ALLOW US TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE UP TO DATE AND- KILEY. WITH THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO US AND I'M HOPING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS. GOING TO BE ROLLED OUT AFFECTED BILLION TO APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO. FOLLOW UP. BUT BUT I WILL JUST AND AGAIN AS I STARTED BY THANKING THE ON YOUTH SPEAKERS. BUT SPECIFICALLY WANTED A CALL OUTS FOR SERRATIA CHILL OUT ON HER- PEER TO PEER THAT ME I DUNNO ALSO SPOKE AT. I THINK THERE IS A HIDDEN GEM HERE FOR US TO BE FOCUSING ON. AS WE PARK HEARD ABOUT THE NEED FOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENTS. THEY SPOKE TO THE ABILITY FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS A LOW COST AND HIGH EFFICIENCY SYSTEM AND- HAVING BEEN SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON S B. IT'LL THREE AND KNOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF PEER SPECIALISTS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK TOWARDS ARE YOU TO LOOK TOWARDS THOSE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE. EXPERIENCED AND TURN IT INTO LEARNING BROTHER STUDENTS EMPOWERS THEM. IT ALLOWS OTHER STUDENTS TO REALIZE THOSE BENEFITS AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL. TAKE WHAT SHE HAS BROUGHT TO THIS COMMITTEE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO FOLLOW UP ON HER RECOMMENDATION TO EXTEND THAT PEER SPECIALIST. TO THOSE WHO ARE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN AS I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FUTURE WORKFORCE- SO WITH THE THAT I WILL THANK ALL. OF THE- FOR PANEL THREE. AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO A PANEL FOR THE ALL CHILDREN THRIVE PROGRAM. WE WILL HAVE JUST TWO PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL MARIA A CHIRLA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND HERALD GOLDSTINE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES LET'S BEGIN WITH MARIO TARA PLEASE. OKAY IN HERE.

DRESSING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA ADDRESSING. CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH MORE BROADLY THANK YOU- LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN AND I CAN DO THAT- BUT YOU'RE MUCH OF THIS QUICKLY MARIA. TALKED ABOUT MUCH OF THIS ABOUT PREVENTION. NOT WORKING UPSTREAM- TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA- BRINGING TOGETHER RESIDENTS IN HOUSTON CITY OFFICIALS TO IDENTIFY THEIR LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND TO CO DESIGN SOLUTIONS WHEN WE NEED TOGETHER WITH UCLA OR BUILDING NETWORKS OF THOSE CITIES- TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER AND TO COLLECTIVELY CHANGE POLICIES AND TRANSFORM SYSTEM. WERE OVERSEEN BY REALLY REMARKABLE FIFTEEN MEMBER EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP- AND AS WE'VE HEARD TEN MILLION DOLLARS WAS FOR THE ISLAND AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNORS- TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SUPPORT TO CONTINUE THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- WE DID ESTABLISH THIS EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP. HELD TOWN HALL MEETINGS TO. BERMAN WHAT- AND A PUBLIC POLL TO DETERMINE WHAT ABOUT CHILDHOOD TRAUMA- WHAT ASPECTS OF IT. BUT ARE THE GREATEST CONCERNS FOR CALIFORNIANS WE DON'T GET A LITERATURE REVIEW TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THOSE PRIORITIES. AND THEN WE BEGAN RECRUITING CITIES TO BE A PART OF THE CAMPAIGN- VALUES ALL ABOUT PREVENTION IT'S ALL ABOUT EQUITY SELL ABOUT YOUTH LEADERSHIP- AS WE HEARD FROM THE ANSWER I'LL- YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THEY KNOW IT A. CORE. THAT IS HELPING TO DIRECT THINKING ABOUT TAKING RISKS ABOUT COLLABORATING ABOUT SHIFTING POWER SO- POLICY CHANGE- BEING ESTABLISHED BASED ON THE VOICES OF RESIDENTS AND YEARS THEM SELVES. BASED ON- THOSE TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND PUBLIC OPINION POLLING WE IDENTIFIED THESE SIX PRIORITY AREAS- FOR EACH OF THOSE PRIORITY AREAS WE DID A LITERATURE REVIEW WITH A BROAD SET OF POLICY. CHANGES ABOUT- BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE DIFFERENT POLICY OPTIONS FOR EACH OF THOSE PRIORITY AREAS. AND THEN WE WERE GREETED STUDIES HAVE LONG TERM PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES HELPED US RECRUIT ESTABLISHED. WHAT WE CALL A CORE TEAM OF AT LEAST A COUPLE RESIDENTS COUPLE CITY OFFICIALS COUPLE YOUTH UNFOCUSED CBO'S. AND I USED TO DESIGN TEAM WE THEN PROVIDED THEM COACH EACH COACH CHARLES- THREE OR FOUR CITIES- REALLY HELPS- TAKE THEM THROUGH THE PROCESS- ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED DOING THIS KIND OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZING FOR TWENTY YEARS IS YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE TO LOOK AT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET SOMETHING DONE- FOLKS NEED HELP. AND- HELP FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE AND WE'VE NOW BEEN DOING. OF EACH OF THE CITIES AND GOT- A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PLANNING GRANTS. AND THEN ONCE THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THEIR PRIORITIES IN THAT EXPAND THAT CORE TEAM TO INCLUDE A BROAD COALITION OF FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY AND THEN THEY JOIN THIS LEARNING COMMUNITY WHERE THEY GET. TO LEARN TOGETHER AND FROM EACH OTHER. HERE YOU CAN SEE. WHAT THE CITIES ARE- CITIES NORTH TO. WEST AND- THOSE ARE IN YELLOW AND THEN WE'VE GOT TWELVE CITIES WHO ARE- ON BOARDED AND READY TO GO FOR THAT FOR THE NEXT ROUND THINGS THOUGH WE'RE WE'RE REALLY PLEASED UP UP FROM THE- MENDOCINO RANCHERIA IN THE NORTH DOWN TO SANTA ANA IN THE CELL- THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'VE GOT. A GREAT COLD COURT. MARY CITIES WHO ARE WHO ARE. DOING THIS WORK. WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THIS PROCESS- THE CERTAIN GENERAL THIS CERTAINLY MADE ACES A PRIORITY- THAT WORK- IS HAS BEEN FOCUSING MOSTLY ON THE MEDICAL CARE SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH ALL CHILDREN THRIVE IS TAKING- THE ISSUE OF TRAUMA PREVENTING TRAUMA MITIGATING TRAUMA- DOWN TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. INVOLVING CITY LEADERS CEOS RESIDENTS- AS I MENTIONED A LOT MORE CITIES ARE READY AND WANTING TO COLLABORATE WE'VE REALLY SEEN- THAT. FOCUS ON TRAUMA IS DOING A GREAT JOB OF BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS BARRIERS BETWEEN CEOS AND CITIES AND BETWEEN CITIES AND USE THOSE OFTEN- GROUPS THAT- SOMETIMES IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON. ANOTHER WORK TOGETHER ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE I'M JUST SO MANY SPEAKERS TODAY MENTION CODE THAT HAS MADE- ISSUES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. OUR FAMILIES AND KIDS. ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT- WE'VE BEGUN TALKING ABOUT ACES ADVERSE KOVIN EXPERIENCES AS WELL- WE'VE LEARNED HOW TO TALK ABOUT- ACES AND TRAUMA IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. HELPING FOLKS FOCUS ON SUSTAINABILITY ON POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE I'M NOT JUST ON PROGRAMS. AND IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS WE'VE WE'VE DONE ALL THIS ORGANIZING VIRTUALLY. DURING CLOSING. I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS TWENTY FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WILL BE WORKING WITH AT LEAST THIRTY CITIES OF AS MANY AS SIXTY. EACH CITY IS GOING TO WORK ON AT LEAST THREE OF THOSE COMMUNITY ACTION AREAS- ALSO EDUCATED RAISE AWARENESS AMONG PARTNERS BUT REALLY THIS IS FOCUSED ON UPSTREAM POLICY SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES THAT WILL ALL BE CONTINUE TO BE OVERSEEN BY THIS EQUITY ADVISORY GROUP I WANT TO JUST SAY. MY GOING AFTER ME AND SURPRISE REALLY QUITE. WHY TIMELY- I REALLY THINK THAT- ACT CITIES HAVE A POSSIBILITY OF BEING REAL INNOVATION HUBS WE'VE GOT WHAT WILL BE THIRTY CITIES AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY IS TO BE HUBS FOR LOW COST STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF KIDS AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE MY AND ANSWER AYE OR SANG THIS OPPORTUNITY OF. I'M SCHOOL AND NEIGHBORHOOD BASED SUPPORT AUGMENTING IT THERE'S NEEDED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT YOUR SUPPORT AND GROUP SUPPORT AS LOW COST- STRATEGIES TO MEET YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING TO TALK ABOUT THE PREVENTION IN THIS CASE THE PREVENTION AND EARLY TREATMENT ARE ACTUALLY THE SAME THING IS PROVIDING KIDS THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THE- DISTRESSES IN THEIR LIVES. AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY SAYING THAT ALL CHILDREN THRIVE- COULD BE A PLACE TO REALLY IMPLEMENT THOSE SERVICES. AND TRY THEM OUT SEE WHAT WORKS- AND THE LIKE. I HAVE TO SAY WELL. WE ORGANIZATION TO WORK IN STOCKTON WHERE WE ADVOCATED FOR SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED STOCKTON SCHOOL DISTRICT- BUT- THREE MILLION DOLLARS YEAH FOR ADDITIONAL- SCHOOL COUNSELORS I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE. ONE OF THE YOUNG SCHOOL COUNSELORS- CITED ABOUT HER JOB IS IT'S A HOW MANY STUDENTS YOU SEE- EVERY WEEK SHE SAID ABOUT FORTY INCHES VERY EXCITED NIGHT WAVE MY ARMS SCHOOL CAMPUS AND I SAID SO HOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS HERE NEED YOUR SUPPORT AND SHE SAID- ALTHOUGH COME. WE WILL NEVER HAVE. ANOTHER PROFESSIONALS. MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL THE KIDS WHO HAVE THESE CHALLENGES IT IS REALLY REALLY THRILLING THAT THERE IS NOW FOR BILLION DOLLARS IT'S GOING TO BE GOING INTO IT. EVEN WITH THAT THE NEED IS GOING TO BE GREATER THAN THE PROFESSIONAL LIVES SUPPORT AND HAS ME ANSWER AYE IT DESCRIBES SO WELL THERE IS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO- BUILD AND SUPPORT YOUNG PEOPLE TO SUPPORT EACH OTHER. SO THAT'S IT FOR ME GRATEFUL FOR. YOUR CONTINUED. THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR GOLDSTINE FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK WITH ALL CHILDREN THRIVE I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP WITH A FEW QUESTIONS IF I COULD I WAS ECSTATIC THAT WE WERE. ABLE TO EXTEND THE FUNDING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT WOULD LIKE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MANY MORE CITIES ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE CURRENTLY BEEN ONBOARDED JUST UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PROCESS. YES THEY WERE UP TO- SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN HELP. WHERE YOU DROP LINE- AB FIFTEEN HAVE GOTTEN GRANTS WE'RE UP TO SEVENTEEN TO GET READY TO GO- OUR PLAN IS TO- GO UP TO AT LEAST THIRTY WHO ARE ACTIVE IN ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVING- TWO HUNDRED SOUTH OR IN COURT SUPPORT THERE WERE. SIXTY THAT WILL BE A PART OF THE BROADER LEARNING COMMUNITY. I REALLY LIKED HOW YOU DESCRIBED IT AS HELPING TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS THAT EXIST BETWEEN CBO'S AND CITIES AS WELL AS BETWEEN CITIES AND YOU'VE- GOT THAT RIGHT. NOW ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT THOSE VALUATION METRICS ARE THAT WE WILL HAVE I BELIEVE YOU CRIED THEM AS COMMUNITY CONDITIONS AND HOPING THAT YOU CAN GIVE US A FEW EXAMPLES. OF WHAT THOSE ARE LIKE AND HOW WE WILL USE THOSE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECTS. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF FOR EACH OF THESE SIX PRIORITY AREAS WE HAVE- ABOUT A HALF DOZEN DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT- THESE. GROUPS ARE GONNA BE CHOOSING FROM SO IT COULD BE ANYTHING SO I'M CITIES ARE ARE CHOOSING THINGS LIKE HEALTHY CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AND IT WOULD INCLUDE SOMETHING LIKE INCLUDING CHILD WELL BEING IN THE LOCAL GENERAL PLAN- YOUR MARKETING FUNDS TO BE A LOCAL TAX. TO IT YOUR AVAILABILITY IF YOU TO THESE SERVICES- MARKINGS OF THOSE FONG FOR GUN VIOLENCE- RANGE OF OPTIONS- YOU MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES. AND SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO MEASURE UP BOTH WHAT POLICIES HAVE BEEN ENACTED AND THEN THE IMPACT OF THOSE BOXES. I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT DURING THE LAST PANEL WE HEARD THAT THE BASE IS- THE BASE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLICES THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON WHAT THE- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES I WOULD. ADD THAT ACT IS ALSO WORKING ON THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES EXULT IN TANDEM ARE. GOING TO ALLOW US TO HELP TO BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS AND I'M WELL YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW EXACTLY I MEAN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I'M TAKING FROM THE HEARING TODAY IS THE IMPORTANCE OF AND IN ALL OF THESE RENTALS- BUT IT'S NOT PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR PEER IT'S BOTH HANDS. IT'S NOT COOL. TO OUR CITIES IT'S- AND THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE- IN SOME ASPECTS OF THIS THE PROBLEM IS SO I MEAN WHEN THAT WHEN THAT SCHOOL COUNSELOR- SO- I'M HER BELIEF THAT. EVERY ONE OF THESE KIDS NEEDS HELP IT WAS STUNNING IT WAS FUNNY. RIGHT HAND IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO- TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE STOCKS. AND I AGREE DOCTOR GOLDSTINE AS- MY OPENING COMMENTS OR LEAVE FOR SHOULD HAVE A CLARION CALL TO ACTION. BASED ON WHAT I DO I TOOK YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. EXACTLY EXACTLY. I'M LAST QUESTION I CAN IS HOW WE MAKE SURE WE'RE COORDINATING WHAT ACT IS DOING WITH THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE SOMEONE LENGTHY CALL WITH MELISSA STAFFORD JONES- LATE LAST WEEK- WE ARE. WE HEARD REMARKABLY IN SYNC IN TERMS OF OUR VISION AND WE COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK TOGETHER ONE OF THE THINGS WE SPECIFICALLY TALKED ABOUT WAS YOUR AND YOUR SUPPORT AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TALKING THERE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE RAND CORPORATION. DO SOME RESEARCH ON WATER WHAT OUR MODELS- FROM AROUND THE WORLD AND YOU SUPPORT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS IT AROUND SUPPORT- HOW IS IT THAT WE AND WHAT WE'RE ALL CHILDREN TRIED NOT TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE THINKING AROUND HERE AND YOU SUPPORT THAT COULD SUPPORT- WHAT MELISSA AND HER TEAM ARE DOING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO THANK BOTH MISS A SHOW AS WELL AS DOCTOR GOLDSTINE AND- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL WHICH WILL COVER THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. FOR YOUNG ADULTS. FOR THOSE PANELISTS WHO ARE PRESENTERS PLEASE PRESENT IN THE ORDER IN WHICH YOU APPEAR IN THE AGENDA. WE HAVE SEVENTEEN PRESENTERS ON THIS PANEL INCLUDING FOR YOUTH SPEAKERS WHO I AGAIN WANT TO PARTICULARLY THANK. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UC CSU AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES OF SEVERAL STATE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND SEVERAL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. I WOULD ASK THAT WE KEEP OUR COMMENTS- POINTED AT OUR YOUNG ADULTS THOSE- AND I WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER ALL THE PRESENTERS HAVE CONCLUDED. LET US BEGIN WITH BREANNA FERNANDEZ IDEAS PLEASE BEGIN. HELLO I'M BRIANNA FERNANDEZ DÍAS- HE MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATE AND A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL OF COOSA TEAM YOUTH ADVISORY GROUP. AND FIRST I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY THANKING YOU ALL FOR YOU KNOW ALLOWING ME THIS SPACE TO TELL YOU ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH MENTAL HEALTH SO. MY MEXICAN IMMIGRANT PARENTS LIKE MANY OTHERS NO CAME OVER HERE WITH THE HOPES OF PROVIDING A BETTER LFE FOR US AND WHAT NOT- YEAH WELL I CAN'T COMPLAIN THAT MY PARENTS DIDN'T DO THAT I CAN SAY THAT ACCESSIBILITY WAS AN ISSUE IN MANY CASES- MY PARENTS ONLY SPOKE SPANISH AND- AS A YOUNG GIRL YOU KNOW IT. ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS NOT IT- WELL I WAS ALREADY YOU KNOW HARD ENOUGH TO SPEAK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR THE YOU KNOW HOUSEHOLDS IT WAS EVEN HARDER TO GET AN ENGLISH SPEAKING DOCTOR TO EXPLAIN WHAT DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND THERAPY OR TO MY PARENTS- AND- AND YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS EXPERIENCE- BUT NOW I AM TWENTY TWO AND ABOUT TO GRADUATE FROM CSU. BUT EVEN THE QUITE EVEN NOW THE QUESTION OF ACCESSIBILITY IS STILL AN ISSUE- I THINK BACK TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I STARTED COLLEGE AND YOU KNOW THE ANXIOUS THOUGH LIKE THE WORLD AROUND ME WAS STOPPED I WOULD CRY ON A DAILY BASIS. AND EVEN THEN I HAD NO HELP. YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS IS NORMAL FEELING YOU KNOW IT YOU'RE BECOMING INDEPENDENT BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN UP TO ME THE SUPPORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE- YET AGAIN I WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES EXCEPT. THIS TIME IT WAS LEFT ALONE TO FEND FOR MYSELF THE PROBLEM WASN'T THAT MY SCHOOL DIDN'T HAVE SUPPORT BUT IT WAS THAT THEY CAN OFFER THE SERVICES THEY NEEDED BECAUSE OF FUNDING FOR THE LACK OF STAFF. FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE COBEN NINETEEN INTO THE PICTURE MOST OF US IF NOT ALL HAD FEELINGS OF FEAR ANXIETY AND HOPELESSNESS OVERTAKE OUR MIND BODY AND SOUL. FOR MY FAMILY WAS ALL OF THE ABOVE AND I REMEMBER FALLING. INTO DEPRESSION BEING ANXIOUS ABOUT SCHOOL AND THE PANDEMIC TOGETHER. WHILE FEELING ALL EMOTIONS I MANAGED TO TRY AND HIT AND LOOK AND LOOK FOR. HELP BY CONTACTING MY DOCTOR I WAS REFERRED TO A NUMBER I CALLED AND I WAS TOLD. I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL BACK. BUT I NEVER GOT THAT CALL BACK AND MY FEELINGS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION JUST CONTINUED. TO GROW WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PANDEMIC TOOK ALL TOOK ALL OF US BY SURPRISE I QUESTION HOW IT WAS THE CASE. THAT THERE WERE POLICIES INITIATIVES AND CAMPAIGNS FOR VACCINATION. HEALTH RESTRICTIONS MANDATES AND PRECAUTIONS LIKE SOCIAL DISTANCING BUT NO CONVERSATION ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL. GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT EVERYONE WAS GOING THROUGH. AS YOU MAY BE ABLE TO TELL FROM MY EXPERIENCE THE QUESTION ON EXTENSIBILITY CARRIES ON INTO ADULTHOOD. AND EARLY ADULTHOOD BUT IF WE MAKE PREVENTION METHODS ACCESSIBLE EARLY ON THE PRACTICES OF HEALTH SEEKING BEHAVIOR WILL BECOME WIDELY ACCEPTABLE. AND NOT. A STIGMA. THAT SAID IT IS IMPORTANTTHAT MENTAL HEALTH ACCESSIBILITY ACROSS ALL FAMILIES ALL AGES EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE BECOMES A PRIORITY ON ALL BECOMES A PRIORITY. ON ALL OF OUR AGENDAS ARE THAT YOU GONNA LET THE NASCO OR AND MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATE THAT I AM URGING ALL TO CONTINUE MAKING. THE EFFORTS TO MAKE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE NOT A PRIVILEGE BUT RATHER RIGHT. AND I KNOW THAT UNDER I KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS WON'T CHANGE OVERNIGHT BEFORE THOSE WHO OF. FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ENGAGED. IN THE WORK OF CREATING EQUAL ACCESS TO SERVICES AND WHO WORK IN PUBLIC SERVICE SERVICES IT IS IMPERATIVE IN MY OPINION. THAT THE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS CENTERED IN EVERY CONVERSATION FROM POLICY. AND FUNDING TO OUTREACH WITH COMMUNITY INFORMING THE PROCESS BECAUSE IN THE END. IT IS TRUE WHEN WE SAY THAT OUR COMMUNITY KNOWS BEST I THANK YOU ALL FOR HEARING ME OUT. AND GIVING ME THE TIME TO SPEAK. THE YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM CULLODEN AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER YOUTH SPEAKER. ALL HI EVERYONE- MY NAME IS QUALITY CONTROL AND I JUST WANT TO START OFF AND SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO'S HERE FROM THE POLICYMAKERS TO THE PHYSICIANS AND TO MY FELLOW YOU'D SPEAKERS- I'M REALLY REALLY PROUD TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING DONE TODAY- ESPECIALLY ON THE YOUTH SPEAKER- SOMETHING THAT WERE OFTEN TOLD SOMETHING WE LIKE TO ASSERT IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WE'RE STRONG WE'RE CONFIDENT WE'RE POWERFUL- BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE DO NEED ADULT ALLIES TO PUSH TO CHANGE WE'RE LOOKING FOR AND I'VE BEEN THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED BY A SO MANY OF YOUTODAY FROM THE WORK YOU'VE DONE I'M TO THE INSIGHTS YOU SHARED- SO ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO REITERATE. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE- I AM WITH SAN JOSE ALL CO- ARE THE SAME ORGANIZATION AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER BRIANNA WE ARE NOT AND THE REASON WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN THAT WORK ON YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH WORK WAS DUE TO MY OWN STORY- AS THE CHILD OF VIETNAMESE WAR REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS- THERE'S BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF INTERGENERATIONAL TRAUMA NOT JUST IN MY HOUSEHOLD BUT IN MY COMMUNITY- IN MY CASE THIS MANIFESTED INTO AN ABUSIVE HOME- THAT RESULTED IN- MENTAL HEALTH DECLINE- SELF HARM ATTEMPTS AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. AND WHEN I CAME TO CONTACT WITH MY SCHOOL- I HAD A VERY WONDERFUL COUNSELOR WHO EVEN WITHOUT ME EXPLICITLY SAYING SO WAS ABLE TO POINT OUT THE SIGNS OF THE PEAKS- AT THIS TIME I WAS AFRAID TO BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME THAT THE PROPER PROCEDURE- FOR STUDENTS SUSPECTED OF HAVING TO SELL EITHER IDEATION OF MICE LIKE MYSELF WAS TO BE REFERRED TO SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S LIVED IN A LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE POLICE ISN'T REALLY AN INSTITUTIONAL. TRUST- AND THAT KIND OF THE KIND OF THE- FORM INTO. WITH MENTAL HEALTH- AND SCHOOL. I'VE HAD ONE TEACHERS PRINCIPALS ADMINISTRATORS COUNSELORS ON OF ALL TRIED TO HELP THE BEST A CAT- BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT THEIR- WHETHER IT BE FUNDING- REVISED POLICIES. AND SO ON SO IT'S REALLY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THAT EVEN ADMINISTRATORS WHOSE HEARTS WERE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE STRUCTURAL OR SYSTEMIC SUPPORT BACKING THEM UP- THEY CAN HELP ME AND I CAN'T FAULT THEM FOR IT I SAW GOOD PEOPLE WITH GOOD HEARTS IS TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST- AND THAT'S WHY I REALLY WANT TO URGE WILL TODAY- TO RETHINK OF HOW WE APPROACH USE MENTAL HEALTH. I'M NOT JUST A SOMETHING TO REACT TO WARM. TO REACT TO BUT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE PREVENTED- BY SETTING UP MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS AND WELLNESS CENTERS IN SCHOOLS ON WHICH WOULD WHICH IS THE MOST ACCESSIBLE FORMS. OF MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERANCE- I CAN THINK OF. AND ARM. IN ADDITION THAT I ALSO WANTED. THE TRIP TO NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT TO IMPLEMENT BUT WHAT TO REMOVE AS WELL FROM ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES TO THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE THERE'S WORK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND WORK THAT WE NEED TO REVISE- SO JUST ONCE AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO EVERYONE HERE- AND I SEE MY TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUAN NATHAN NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ZOFIA TREXLER. HI EVERYONE I MY NAME IS A FEW TRAXLER THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- I'M THE MEMBER I'M A MEMBER OF THE CAN BOARD WHERE ARE YOU FLOOD PROGRAM OF MENTAL HEALTH AMERICA OF CALIFORNIA. THAT EMPOWERS TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH OR TAY TO BE LEADERS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM TRANSFORMATION IN ORDER TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S TODAY. SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME- I'M FOR FRESNO CALIFORNIA MY MOM IS A SLAVIC IMMIGRANT SHE'S FROM POLAND. AND MY DAD IS MEXICAN AND BOTH OF THESE CULTURES DID NOT REALLY EMPHASIZED MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION. AND TREATMENT WHEN I WASYOUNGER- MY FATHER I HE HAS A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER- AND BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH- STUFF. I HE PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY ABUSED ME- A LOT THROUGHOUT MY CHILDHOOD. SO IN ADOLESCENCE- I KIND OF REPEATED THAT CYCLE OF MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITY I AND I DEVELOPED SEVERE SIAC PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES. AND MY FRESHMAN YEAR F HIGH SCHOOL I WAS PLACED UNDER A FIFTY ONE FIFTY. AFTER SUICIDE ATTEMPT- AND AFTER I WAS JUST CHARGE MY MOM WHO PUT IN A LOT OF EFFORT INTO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME. ON SHE GAVE ME THIS BOOK ABOUT HOW ABRAHAM LINCOLN. DEALT WITH DEPRESSION- BECAUSE WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I. WAS WOULD ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW I WANTED TO BE THE PRESIDENT- AND SHE SAID THAT SHE WANTED ME TO KNOW THAT I COULD ACHIEVE MY DREAMS. AND I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANTED- DESPITE WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH. AND IT A LOT OF THE WAY SHE WAS RIGHT- MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. I GOT TO MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE AND I ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER GRADUATION- BECAUSE OF THAT MY PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES I REALLY DID NOT DO WELL IN HIGH SCHOOL DESPITE ACCOMMODATIONS- BUT WITH THE SUPPORT OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE- AND ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS THEY RECEIVE THROUGH THEIR- IN THE SPRING I'M GOING TO GRADUATE WITH THREE SOCIUS DEGREES- AND I'M GONNA TRANSFER TO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS SO THAT I CAN ACHIEVE MY DREAM. OF ACTUALLY GOING TO LAW SCHOOL- I CURRENTLY HAVE A FOUR POINT NO I HAVE. A WONDERFUL JOB WITH DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE I GET TO BE A PEER EDUCATOR FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH- AND I HAVE SO MANY WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH THE K. AND BOARD THAT HAVE GIVEN ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE AND UPLIFT TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH. BUT NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND COMMUNITY SAID COMMUNITY SUPPORT THAT ENABLED ME TO SUCCEED. THERE ARE COUNTLESS PEOPLE. PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY- WHO DID NOT GET THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEEDED. AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO SUCCEED. I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORTS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION RESOURCES IN OUTRAGE TAILORED SPECIFICALLY FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH IS NECESSARY TO EDUCATE YOUTH. ABOUT HOW THEY CAN ACCESS THINGS LIKE ACADEMIC AND EMPLOYMENT ACCOMMODATIONS TRANSITION INTO HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT. AND ACCESS RESOURCES THAT ENABLE THEM TO SUCCEED. SUPPORTS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS HAND GIVING TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE OTHER YOUTH IS INVALUABLE- I ALSO JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES SYSTEM. AND WHAT THAT HAS MEANT TO ME. IT REALLY DID GIVE ME A SECOND CHANCE AFTER HIGH I HAD STRUGGLED SO MUCH IN HIGH SCHOOL. AND FOR THAT I'M REALLY GRATEFUL. COMMUNITY COLLEGES- SERVE SOME OF THE MOST UNDERPRIVILEGED UNDER RESOURCED GROUPS. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO PLACE RESOURCES THERE- AND THEY'VE HELPED ME A LOT. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE ANDY CAR STERILIZING MENTAL HEALTH- AND HEAVY REFORM OF OUR LOCKED PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTIONS OF STATE HOSPITALS. IS A HUGE PART OF THAT- AFTER AS FIFTY ONE FIFTIESI WAS SENT TO A PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION- AND THE TREATMENT INSIDE THOSE FACILITIES. IS DEHUMANIZING. AND ABUSIVE. I'M IN NO CHILD NO PERSON SHOULD EVER BE TREATED LIKE THAT. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME TALK TO THE OTHER COUNTLESS YOUTH- WHO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY'VE- BEEN AFRAID TO TELL THEIR CARE PROVIDERS THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF BEING PLACED UNDER FIFTY ONE FIFTY. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF EXPERIENCING. YOU KNOW THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT THAT OCCURS INSIDE THOSE FACILITIES. WE NEED A TRANSITION TO COMMUNITY BASED CARE TO NOT ONLY REDUCE THE ABUSE AND NEGLECT- BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR NEED FOR CARE BECAUSE- NO ONE SHOULD BE AFRAID. TO EXPRESS THEIR NEED FOR CARE IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW EXPERIENCING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS FOR FEAR THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW MATT WITH. WITH WITH THE HUMANIZING TREATMENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP THEM OUT IN THE LONG RUN. THERE WERE A LOT OF ADULTS WHO SPOKE AT THIS HEARING. AND I JUST WANTED TO READ HERE READ READ OR HATE THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY INCLUDING BUT ACTIVELY LISTENING TO AND TREATING YOU THE SEQUELS IN THESE CONVERSATIONS- BECAUSE NOT DOING THAT DOES A GREAT DISSERVICE TO YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED A LOT OF GREAT THINGS A LOT OF GREAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING SET INTO MOTION. AND I HOPE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WILL MAKE AN EFFORT TO INCLUDE YOUTH AND THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK IT'S REALLY AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO RPRESENT THE CAN BOARD AND THE YOU THE FRESNO AT THIS HEARING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR FREE OFFER HAVING THE COURAGE IN SPEAKING YOUR TRUTH NO ONE SHOULD BE AFRAID AND I BELIEVE BY YOUR TESTIMONY YOU WILL HELP OTHERS TO HAVE THAT COURAGE AS WELL. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM IF YOU COOK. IF YOU COOK IF YOU CAN BEGIN. YOU MAY BE ON MUTE Q. WE WILL THEN MOVE ON TO JEANNIE KIM DIRECTOR OF STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.

STUDENTS IN COLLEGIATE RECOVERY AND STUDENT BASIC NEEDS IS ESSENTIAL AND CRITICAL TO THIS WORK. IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVES ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ARE NOT IMMUNE TO BE HERO HEALTH CHALLENGES IN FACT STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AT THE SAME RATE AS OUR NATIONAL PURE. IN A RECENT SURVEY ADMINISTERED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 29% OF STUDENTS REPORTED SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR. 21% OF STUDENTS REPORTED DEPRESSION. 24% OF STUDENTS REPORTED ANXIETY AND 2% OF OUR STUDENTS REPORT BEING IN RECOVERY FROM ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG USE. ALL THIS DATA PROVIDE SOME GENERAL INSIGHTS INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING CHALLENGES OF OUR STUDENTS. WE KNOW THAT UTILIZATION OF CAMPUS BASED SERVICES WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. THIS IS DUE IN PART TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO DUE TO EFFORTS TO REDUCE STIGMA INCREASE HELP SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND EXPAND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMMING AND REFERRALS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY ELEVEN THE UNIVERSITY RECEIVED SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. FROM PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. THESE FUNDS WERE USED TO DEVELOP A TRAINING AN EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM CALLED THE RED FOLDER. THE RED FOLDER WAS THE PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL RESOURCE FOR ALL STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. TO ACCESS UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. IN ADDITION HE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RECEIVED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING NINETEEN. AND ANOTHER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONGOING STUDENT LOCAL FUNDING IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FROM THE STATE THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MEET THE GROWING DEMANDS FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. RECOGNIZING THAT MENTAL HEALTH IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST ACCESS TO THERAPY THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED A HOLISTIC MODEL TO SUPPORT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE. WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HEALTH EXISTS ON A CONTINUUM AND SUPPORTING THE WHOLE BRAIN HEALTH MODEL IS MORE THAN JUST ONE TREATMENT MODALITY. TO QUOTE A LONGTIME ADVOCATE OF THIS WORK TOM INSULT CURRENT TREATMENTS WORK MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A LIFE SENTENCE AND PEOPLE CAN RECOVER. MEANING WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THERE ARE NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACHES TO SUPPORTING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS NEEDS OF AN INDIVIDUAL. MENTAL WELL BEING EXIST ON A CONTINUUM. THE UNIVERSITY HAS EMBARKED ON AN EQUITY IN MENTAL HEALTH INITIATIVE TO PROVIDE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND HOLISTIC TREATMENT AND RECOVERY SUPPORTS TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CRISIS INTERVENTION BY PHONE. AND EACH CAMPUS PROVIDE SAME DAY VIRTUAL AND IN PERSON TRIAGE ASSESSMENT. THIS SPEAKS TO THE NEED TO AND PARTNER WITH CAMPUS AND COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE THAT ACCESS TO CARE WHERE OUR STUDENTS ARE. EACH CAMPUS OFFERS INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP THERAPY AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR RECOVERY. THE UNIVERSITY'S COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION THAT IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO THRIVE THEY OUGHT TO HAVE A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS SERVICES AND RESEARCH RESOURCES TO CUSTOM BUILD THEIR OWN PORTFOLIO STRENGTH SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES ALONGSIDE CLINICAL TREATMENT. AND PRACTICES WE USE LANGUAGE LIKE MEETING STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE IN A UNIVERSITY SETTING THE UC HAS CREATED AN ECOSYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR OUR STUDENTS. OUR STUDENTS LIVE WORK IN RECTORY ON IN YOUR CAMPUSES AND WHAT THIS MEANS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNIVERSITY SETTING IS THAT THERE'S NO WRONG DOOR STRATEGY TO PROVIDE HOLISTIC SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS. STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO BASIC NEEDS CENTERS AND STUDENT HEALTH AND WELLBEING SUPPORTS HOWEVER EQUITY GAPS DO EXIST PARTICULARLY OUR STUDENTS NAVIGATE CAMPUS SPACE AND COMMUNITY BASED RESOURCES IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE. THE UNIVERSITY HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN BRIDGING THESE GAPS BURNING CLOSELY WITH COUNTY AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES HOWEVER MORE STRATEGIC EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO COORDINATE SERVICES RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THE CALIFORNIA YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS KEY TO REDUCING EQUITY GAPS AND ENSURING CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR ALL USED IN CALIFORNIA- I'LL CLOSE MY REMARKS BY EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING THE COLLEGE AGE POPULATION. AS A KEY POPULATION TO MITIGATING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS COMMITTED TO ADVANCING RESEARCH DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND EXPANDING SERVICES AND SUPPORTS TO MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JOY STEWART JAMES THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT. FOR CSU SACRAMENTO. GOOD EVENING- I'M JULIE STEWART JAMES ON THE ASSOCIATE VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT HEALTH AND COUNSELLING SERVICES AS SACRAMENTO STATE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE IN DEPTH-% ANALYSIS OF LOOKING AT THIS AND- I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY REGARDING THE STATUS OF MENTAL HEALTH- IN THE CSU CAMPUSES. PRIOR TO THE COBIT PANDEMIC THE CSU COUNSELING CENTERS WERE ALREADY EXPERIENCING HIGH DEMAND. FOR SERVICES AND A LARGE PART DUE TO THE- EFFORTS THAT WE'VE DONE TO DE STIGMATIZE MENTAL HEALTH AND HELP AND ENCOURAGE HELP SEEKING BEHAVIORS AND OUR NATIONAL- CULTURAL SURVEY- DATA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN COMPARED TO OUR TWENTY SIXTEEN- REPORTED THAT MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE GENERALLY WORSE FOR IN THE AREAS OF HOPELESSNESS DEPRESSION ANXIETY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING SUICIDE. OUR TWENTY TWENTY SYSTEM WIDE REPORT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE IT WILL BE NEXT MONTH BUT OUR CAMPUS SPECIFIC DATA SHOWS THAT 80% OF OUR STUDENTS. ARE EXPERIENCING MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS 53% REPORT LONELINESS 24% REPORT SUICIDALITY. ADDITIONALLY RESPONDENTS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY RICK- REPORTING UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE THEY'RE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE FEAR THAT SOMEONE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT ME DIET KOPEN AND THEY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SPEND THE AMOUNT OF TIME- THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY CARE ABOUT SO AS WE ETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WERE PREPARING FOR A TSUNAMI- IN TERMS OF INCREASING DEMAND ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WHEN THE CO GOOD PANDEMIC- OCCURRED IN MARCH OUR COUNSELING STAFF IMMEDIATELY PIVOTED TO TELL ACCOUNT SLING AND WE FOUND THAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY- RESPONDED TO THAT TYPE OF- CARE. AND SO WE'VE INCREASED AND ARE NOW LOOKING AT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ON GOING HYBRID AFTER HOURS CARE. AND WE FOUND THAT. STUDENTS ARE. NEEDING TO- IF THEY NEED INCREASED DEMAND FOR A FOR A WIDE CONTINUUM OF SERVICES I KNOW THAT'S BEEN SPOKEN OF BEFORE BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS STUDENTS ARE COMING WITH A- SUCH A BROAD RANGE OF ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS TO- REALLY PSYCHOSIS THAT WE'RE HAVING TO DEAL WITH AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE BEING FACED WITH IS OUR ABILITY TO REFER STUDENTS TO HIGH LEVEL ACUITY CARE WHAT WHAT THE MONEY HAS THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAS SUPPORTED US IS THE ABILITY TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE UNIQUE NEEDS ARE ON OUR ON OUR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES. AND I CAN TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY FROM- SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES THAT WE'VE- ADDED URGING KERR COUNSELING THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HANDLE DAY TO DAY CRISIS CARE WITH HIGHER CARE COORDINATORS TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST STUDENTS WITH REFERRALS FOR- TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES WE'VE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED THE ACES- SCREENING DEPRESSION SCREENING- SUBSTANCE ABUSE SCREENING FOOD AND SECURITY SCREENING IN OUR MEDICAL BUSINESS OF OUR HILLS HEALTH CENTERS THAT HAVE ALLOWED US TO THEN IMMEDIATELY CONNECT THOSE STUDENTS- EARLY ON WITH APPROPRIATE RESOURCES- WE'VE DEVELOPED AND CREATED WHAT. YOUR COUNSELING. THAT REALLY HAVE MET WITH- GREAT SUCCESS FOR THE PEER TO PEER- COMPONENT WE NEED TO ESTABLISHED SATELLITE COUNSELING OFFICES WHERE WE'VE TAKEN MENTAL HEALTH LEAVE ACTUALLY- BROUGHT IT TO THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN BEING HOUSE STRICTLY IN THAT IN THE HEALTH CENTER. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OFFERING A VOUCHER SYSTEM- TO POUR SOME OF THE- STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR THINGS LIKE- PSYCHIATRY CARE ADHD TESTING AUTISM DISORDERS EATING DISORDER PROGRAMS AND SO ON- WE'VE IMPLEMENTED PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE VIRTUAL AFTER HOURS AND WEEKEND COUNSELING SERVICES. WERE ALSO PARTNERING FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE- RECOVER IN RECOVERY PROGRAMS SO X. AND WE'RE EXPANDING SOCIAL MEDIA AND- MARKETING AND EDUCATION RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN BETTER- HELP TRIAGE. WHAT WHAT I THINK IS UNUSUALLY THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB WITH TEACHING INDIVIDUALS HOW TO SELF TRIAGE AND HOW TO ACCESS APPROPRIATE RESOURCES AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. ENCOURAGING HELP BUT WE'VE NOT DONE A GREAT JOB I THINK IN TERMS OF HELPING STUDENTS UNDERSTAND HOW TO ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTH SERVICES AND SO WE'RE USING SOCIAL MEDIA WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY ACROSS THE CAMPUSES SO THAT FACULTY STAFF HAVE EARLY RECOGNITION AND UNDERSTAND APPROPRIATE RESOURCES. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERCENT- AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR THE FUNDING THAT YOU PROVIDED AND- AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE SUPPORT THAT IS REALLY BEING GIVEN TO THIS EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM GOING TO RETURN AND SEE IF WE CAN GIVE HUGH COOK ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO- PRESENT- HUGH COOK IF YOU CAN BEGIN. HELLO MY NAME IS HERE KIRK. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH. THE TECHNICAL TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES- YEAH. I'M UCSB STUDENT AND I GOT SHOWS FOR A COVER REPAIR INTERN. AND I JUST WANT TO START OFF BY SHARING A LITTLE BIT WITH YOU ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES- WITH. JAGANNADH CALL. I ENCOUNTERED ALCOHOL FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THE FIRST TIME I DRANK I DID BLACK OUT- AND I EXPERIENCED ALL THE MISADVENTURES THAT COME ALONG WITH A- AND I SHARE THAT BECAUSE TO ME THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE WAY THAT THIS IS A SPECIFICALLY BIOLOGICAL. ILLNESS IT RUNS IN MY FAMILY AND- YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS OUT OF MY CONTROL OF THAT BUT THAT SUBSTANCE IN MY BODY. AND THIS CONTINUED IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH ME DRINKING AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT AND I WENT ON TO DISCOVER THINGS LIKE VALIUM AND AFTER ALL. AND WHEN I TOOK THESE SUBSTANCES MY MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES REALLY- INTENSIFIED AND IN MY JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL I HAD APPRECIATED BY THE TIMES THAT- LET ME SPENDING THREE DAYS IN THE ICU AND THEN GOING TO A PSYCHIATRIC WARD AND OF COURSE AFTER I LEFT THE PSYCHIATRIC WARD. I SAW A PSYCHIATRIST AND I SPOKE WITH I KIND OF JUST AND I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT- A DRUG LIKE VALUE MUCH OF THE BAND THAT OUT IF YOU CAN REALLY RELAX AND THAT THAT HELPS ME A LOT WITH MY ANXIETY- THE DRUG IS ALSO REALLY ADDICTIVE AND- YOU KNOW. UP UNTIL ABOUT. TWO YEARS AGO I WAS I'M PRETTY ADDICTED TO KLONOPIN. AND I THINK ON THE OUTSIDE IT APPEARED THAT MY LIFE WAS GOING ALL RIGHT AND- YOU KNOW I WAS MOVING TOWARDS COMPLETING A DEGREE WE- ARE GOING TO GRADUATE SCHOOL BUT THOSE CLOSEST TO ME COULD SEE THAT I REALLY WASN'T OKAY DONE ON THE INSIDE THERE WAS A LOT OF TOMORROWLAND. AND AND EVENTUALLY I KNEW THAT NEEDED TO CHANGE AND- I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE SENT TO REHAB YOU KNOW MY PARENTS ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THAT- AND THAT'S NOT NOT TRUE FOR EVERYBODY- AND AFTER THAT I WAS ABLE TO SPEND MORE TIME IN CONTINUING CARE AND- GETTING A LITTLE MORE THERAPY AND LIVING IN A SOBER HOUSE. AND THAT IS ALSO SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY 90% OF. THE STUDENT POPULATION WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD- ON. AND NOW I'M INVOLVED WITH THIS PROGRAM GOT SHOWS THE COUNTRY AND IT'S A REALLY BEAUTIFUL A COLLECTION OF PEERS WHO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER AND- FOX- SOBER SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITY- SO WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND US MOST HELPFUL TO STUDENTS LIKE MILLIONS OF THE STUDENTS AYE THEIN AND UNABLE TO WORK WITH. IS FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO HAVE FUNDING FOR INPATIENT TREATMENT FOR STUDENTS WHEN THEY NEED IT. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF SCHOOL IF NECESSARY- TO GO. GET SPECIALIZED TREATMENT. AND THEN AFTERWARDS FOR THERE TO BE CONTINUING CARE FOR THERE TO BE- THE AVAILABLE. THERAPY WITH A FANATIC FOCUS WHICH I FOUND REALLY REALLY HELPFUL QUALIFIED PSYCHIATRISTS. AND SOBER HOUSING- SOBER HOUSING IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR COLLEGE AGE STUDENTS BECAUSE THIS IS A TIME WHEN A LOT OF PEERS ARE BEGINNING TO EXPLORE. THANK NOT CALL THEMSELVES AND FELT THAT THAT PART OF OUR LIVES TO PASS. THEM IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL TO HAVE. A CONTAINER US HOW THAT CAN THE OF BUTTING REALIGNING OF LIFE. THAT OCCURS IN THE PROCESS OF SOBRIETY. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THOSE TO THE TO THE THIS YEAR AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR. YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE WITH THE- TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES AND THE FACT THAT WELL GET BACK TO YOU GUYS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY NEXT WE WILL GO TO REBEKAH RULAND O'SHAUGHNESSY WHO IS THE VICE CHANCELLOR. FOR THE CALIFORNIA. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU TEARS A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES MY NAME IS YOUR BACKGROUND SHAUGHNESSY I'M THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I'M VERY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A STATUS UPDATE ON ONGOING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO STATE BUDGET. TO EXPAND OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR OUR STUDENTS. I WANT TO REALLY THANK ARE YOU SPEAKERS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP THEIR COURAGE AND THEIR INSPIRING STORIES- AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE OPEN ACCESS INSTITUTIONS. AND WE CURRENTLY SERVE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION STUDENTS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM. A MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IS THE NUMBER ONE NEED HIGHLIGHTED BY OUR STUDENTS. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AT LEAST EXPERIENCING A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THAT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC TWO THIRD OF THE STUDENTS REPORTED A HIGHER LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH DISTRESS THEM PRIOR TO THE CONDEMN EC. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO RECEIVE IN THE BUDGET FOR THE FIRST TIME ONGOING DEDICATED FUNDING OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OUR STUDENTS. THE UNDS HAVE BEEN FULLY ALLOCATED TO THE COLLEGES WE TOOK A TWO TIER APPROACH WITH OUR FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR THE FIRST YEAR WHAT WE ALLOCATED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO EVERY COLLEGE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL HAS SOME RESOURCES TO BUILD OUT BASIC MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. THE SECOND TIER WHICH IS THE REMAINING TWENTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WE ALLOCATED TO COLLEGES BASED ON THE TOTAL HEAD COUNT OF STUDENTS EACH COLLEGE SERVES. TO ACCOMMODATE LOCAL VARIATIONS AS WELL AS THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF PELL RECIPIENTS FOR EACH COLLEGE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE SYSTEM RECEIVES ONGOING FUNDING FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH THE FUNDING NOT ONLY PROVIDED THE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES. BUT THE ONGOING NATURE OF THE FUNDINGHAS REALLY BROUGHT THE SENSE OF CERTAINTY TO THE SYSTEM AND ALLOWED OUR COLLEGES TO BE MORE STRATEGIC. ENGAGING IN LOCAL PLANNING AND INVESTING IN. LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT BUILD ON NECESSARY SERVICE DELIVERY INFRASTRUCTURE. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING SPECIFIC DATA ON HOW COLLEGES ARE SPENDING THE FUNDING AND WE WON'T HAVE TO I WILL HAVE THE DETAILS UNTIL THEY SUBMIT THEIR FIRST ANNUAL REPORTS AFTER THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. BUT ANECDOTALLY WE KNOW MANY COLLEGES ARE HIRING ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS TO EXPAND ON CLINICAL SERVICES. SOME ALSO WORKING ON EXPANDING THEIR COLLABORATION WITH OUR FOR YOUR PARTNERS ON M. S. W. AND L. C. S. W. INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS. IN LIGHT OF THE REALITY OF COAL VENT AND THEY EVER DOUBLE FUTURE OF DISTANCE EDUCATION. ANY COLLEGES AREN'T REALLY THINKING ABOUT INVESTING IN MENTAL HEALTH IN WAYS THAT MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE INCLUDING MORE FLEXIBILITY IN IN PERSON SERVICES AND TELEMUNDO HEALTH SOLUTIONS. AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WHERE YOU'LL RISING A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS FRAMEWORK TO THINK ABOUT COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO PRIORITIZE MENTAL HEALTH. THE STIGMATIZE MENTAL ILLNESS AS STRENGTH A HOLISTIC STUDENT SUPPORT WE SHOULD LOOK AT UPSTREAM PREVENTION AND DOWNSTREAM SOLUTIONS. A LOOK AT OUR STUDENTS SERVICE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A WHOLE NOT JUST THE DEDICATED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SO FOR EXAMPLE WE'RE MAKING EXPLICIT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EQUITABLE STUDENT EXPERIENCES AS STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. REALLY DIGGING INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CLASSROOMS AT ALL CAMPUSES TO UNDERSTAND AND REDUCE UNNECESSARY STRESSORS AND AVOID REGIONALIZATION FOR STUDENTS. AND HAVING TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AS A BEDROCK STRATEGY. FOR STUDENT ENGAGEMENT ACROSS THE BOARD. WE'RE ALSO SUPPORTING COLLEGES TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION AL THE AMOUNT STUDENT IDENTITIES. IN THE BASIC NEEDS INSECURITY STUDENTS ARE FACING FOR EXAMPLE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENTAL HEALTH AND HOUSING AND SECURITY HEALTH AND HOUSING SECURITY AND FOSTER YOU OR MENTAL STRESSORS RIGHT THE HOUSE ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH SO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE ALL DIFFERENT FUNDING IS TO PROVIDE HOLISTIC SUPPORT. EVEN THOUGH WE OPERATE WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF FUNDING STREAMS WERE ENCOURAGING COLLEGES TO TAKE A STUDENT CENTER LINES TO GET CLEAR ON THE PROBLEM MAXIMISING RESOURCES AND SHIP STRUCTURES TO ENSURE STUDENT SUCCESS. WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING WAYS TO HARNESS THE STRENGTH OF OUR SYSTEM. THE VALUABLE EXPERIENCES OUR STUDENTS BRING TO OUR SYSTEM AND OUR ABILITY TO BE THE PRIMARY ENGINE FOR ADVANCING SOCIAL ECONOMIC MOBILITY. SO HOW DO WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE PIPELINE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHILE RECOGNIZING THE EFFICACY OF THE PEER TO PEER SUPPORT MODEL THE HIDDEN GEM THAT GERMAN. ARAMBULA CALLED IT. THROUGH EXPANDING INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WITHOUT FOR YOUR PARTNERS IT WAS STRENGTHENING OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING EXPLORING THE OPTIONS OF CREATING LEARNING LABS TO ENHANCE LEARNING FOR STUDENTS. AND ALSO THROUGH VALUE IN THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR STUDENTS TO BE OUR CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING TO BUILD A PATHWAY FROM HOME CARE TO HEALTH CARE. SO WE'RE DEFINITELY MAKING PROGRESS IN MANY FRONTS. BEFORE SYSTEM OF OUR SIZE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ROUGHLY TRANSLATES INTO SIXTY SEVEN DOLLARS A PERSON WITH A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL ILLNESS BASED ON THE PRE PANDEMIC NUMBERS. WHICH IS FAR FROM SUFFICIENT ADDRESS THE FULL% SPECTRUM OF NEEDS FOR STUDENTS. WE REALLY RELY ON PARTNERSHIPS AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. SO IS THE SYSTEM WE'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS OUR STUDENTS AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUOUS SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT.

ARE YOUNG ADULTS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ARE COMPARED TO OTHER AGE GROUPS INDIVIDUALS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE HAVE THE HIGHEST RAT OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESSES SEVEN POINT 1% COMPARED TO FOUR POINT ARE NEARLY TWICE AS LIKELY TO HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AS OLDER ADULTS ADULTS SIXTEEN POINT 1% VERSUS.

I DH CS IS VERY COMMITTED TO ENSURING WE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF ALL CHILDREN. H. MYSTERIES TO ENSURE WE ARE HEARING FROM YOU THAT OUR FAMILIES AND CAREGIVERS THIS CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM ELIZABETH FLANSBURGH DIRECTOR OF EACH GUY ARAMBULA NOT BE SPEAKING BOTH FOR MY FOR H. FIVE SO- AS DISCUSSED BY DIRECTORS DR JONES H. CHI IS ALSO ENGAGED IN STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH INCLUDING YOUNG ADULTS SO IT'S REALLY FOUNDATIONAL TO US TO LISTEN DIRECTLY TO CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES. INCLUDING TRANSITION AGE YOUTH- IS YOU DID THIS EVENING AND WE ALSO WANT TO EXTEND OUR APPRECIATION TO ALL OF THOSE WHO SPOKE AND PLEASE KNOW THAT WE'RE LISTENING TO YOU WERE INCORPORATING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND LISTENING AND EVERYTHING THAT WE DO AS IT IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH JOURNEYS THAT YOU HAVE. AND THE BARRIERS THAT THEY HAVE AN X. AT IN ACCESSING CARE AS DIRECTORS DEBORAH JONES SAID WE ARE LISTENING AND WE KNOW YOU'RE TELLING US TO BE BOLD I'M NOT TO BE CONSTRAINED BY OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS AND SO WERE REALLY CHALLENGING OURSELVES TO DO THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING MORE SPECIFICALLY WITH THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. H. BECAUSE COMPONENTS. OF THE WHICH CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IS DEVELOPING THE WORK FORCE- THAT'S NEEDED. AND SO WE HAVE COMPONENTS- WORKFORCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM PIPELINE- SO THE WORD TO HAVING RECRUITMENT AND CAREER EXPLORATION PROGRAMS. PEER SUPPORT PROGRAMS ALL THE WAY UP TO FUNDING TRAINING FOR PSYCHIATRISTS AND ALL OF THE MANY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS- IN BETWEEN. ONE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE WE KNOW IS FACING YOUNG ADULTS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND MANY HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THAT TODAY. SO WE KNOW THAT THE DATA SHOW THAT SUBSTANCE MISUSE OFTEN STARTS IN EARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS- AS AS WE HEARD. AND INTENSIFIES FOR EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS SUBSTANCE USE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE MORE PREVALENT- ON WITH THIS THIS TAKE AGE GROUP- AND ALL OF THAT HAS INCREASED DURING THE PANDEMIC. SO H. CHI IS NEWER TO THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WORKFORCE PROGRAMS WERE WERE PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THAT. AND THE NEEDS OF THE TRANSITION AGE YOU. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE DOESN'T REFLECT THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MAKE UP OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE TO TWENTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA ARE LET NEXT. COMPARED 28% OF PSYCHOLOGISTS 23% OF COUNSELORS A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO INCREASE THE RACIAL AND LINGUISTIC DIVERSITY OF THE WORKFORCE AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO RECRUITING. MORE DIVERSE WORK FORCE PROVIDING THOSE JOINING THE WORK FORCE WITH SUPPORT AND EXPECTING TRAINING PROGRAMS TO HAVE ARTICULATED EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES FOR ADDRESSING BIAS DIRECTLY. THE AGENDA ASKS H. CONSPECIFIC WE HOW WE ARE WORKING WITH COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES- AND COLLEGES THAT CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE CERTAINLY KEEP PARTNERS IN ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM ALL THE PARTNERS TODAY. DATA SHOW THAT APPROXIMATELY 59% OF YOUNG ADULTS ARE ENROLLED IN A COLLEGE PROGRAM. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN TRAINING AND BUILDING A DIVERSE CULTURALLY COMPETENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. IN ADDITION COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE PLACES WHERE YOUNG ADULTS ARE SERVED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. HAVING SUFFICIENT PROVIDERS SERVING IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IS ESSENTIAL TO MITIGATING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES FACED VERY YOUNG ADULTS SO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC WAYS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PARTNERS- IS THAT WERE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION CENTER OR CAL SELECT. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE CAPACITY TO TRAIN MORE SOCIAL WORKERS I THINK WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE DAY- ABOUT THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGES IN THE NEEDS TO. OUR ACCELERATE AND EXPAND MANY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND SO WERE WERE PLEASED TO BE IN CONVERSATIONS BOTH WITH CAL SPECS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT TRAINING MORE SOCIAL WORKERS. WE ARE SUPPORTING THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM A PROGRAM OUT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES WHICH BUILDS A PIPELINE TO DEVELOPING AND PREPARING A DIVERSE WORK FORCE PREPARED FOR ENTERING MEDICAL SCHOOL. AND THEN OUR NEW CALIFORNIA HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING COUNCIL HAS REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO THAT WILL ALLOW IT'S AN ONGOING WAY. TO ENGAGE WITH THESE CRITICAL PARTNERS ON TRAINING THE WORKFORCE FOR TOMORROW SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO OTHER AREAS OF COLLABORATION WITH THE COLLEGE UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS. MOVING FORWARD AND RECRUITING A MORE DIVERSE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE TRAINING AND SUPPORTING THOSE YOUNG ADULTS ENTERING THE PROFESSION. AND DEVELOPING THEIR SKILLS THANK YOU.

CDPH SS AND DH CS ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO DEVELOP A DATA MATRIX THAT WILL IDENTIFY RELEVANT DATA SOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THESE DEPARTMENTS. THIS DATA MATRIX WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY GAPS AND THAT MAY HAVE A LITTLE DATA. SO THOSE GAPS CAN BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TOBY EWING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD EVENING TOBY DOING AGAIN FOR THE MEDICAL SERVICES OR SEND KIND OF THE COMMISSION- YOU KNOW I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR GAME PLAN EARLY PSYCHOSIS WHICH IS OUR- NOT OUR ONLY WORK TARGETING YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS BUT IT'S A KEY EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- IN THIS WORK THE COMMISSION SPENT SOME TIME WORKING AS HAVE TO MATTER EXPERTS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE STATE. AROUND PSYCHOSIS- THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES A CORE BEST PRACTICE IN THIS SPACE BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT'S AVAILABLE ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF AVAILABLE SERVICES FOR THE RESPONDING TO PSYCHOSIS EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT DISEASE WE FOUND LARGELY THAT THE EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE. NOR WAS THERE IS THAT THE KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT I NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE FIDELITY TO THE MODEL. SO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME CORE COUNTIES SOLANO COUNTY REALLY STEPPED UP IN PARTICULAR SOLANO COUNTY- BUT ALSO WITH THE UC PARTNERS UCSF UC DAVIS. BUT AS AS WELL THE STANFORD AND OTHERS.

AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT SUSTAINABLE FINANCING AGAIN FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE OF- EVERYBODY WHO KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. THIS SORT OF- SHORTHAND IS GENERALLY THAT FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS ACCORDING TO SPECIALTY CARE IS AVAILABLE THAN MEDICARE PAYS ABOUT 80% OF THE COST. FOR COMMERCIAL INSURANCE IT'S ABOUT WE DID WITH SUPPORT FROM UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS. AND NIMH AND OTHERS WE HEARD OF A SPEAKER I'M A MOTHER OF A YOU HAVE A YOUNG WOMAN WHO TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT SHE FACED IN ACCESSING CARE. AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT WERE IT NOT FOR MAKING THE RIGHT PHONE CALL KNOWING THE RIGHT PEOPLE JUST SO HAPPEN TO HAVE SOME GRANT OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE THAT THIS YOUNG WOMAN WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT WAS NECESSARY. TO SUPPORT HER RECOVERY AND MAINTENANCE OF HER NEEDS IN A WAY THAT SHE COULD. LIVE AT HOME AND WORK STAY CONNECTED WITH HER FAMILY TOO OFTEN WE SEE THE OUTCOMES OF PSYCHOSIS THAT IS NOT ADDRESSED OR IS NOT ADDRESSED IN A TIMELY MANNER. EMISSIONS GOAL IN THIS WORK IS TO REALLY BEGIN TO BUILD OUT A SCALABLE STRATEGY SO THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO CORN AND ESPECIALLY CARE OVER TIME. SIMILARLY THAT IS OUR GOAL WITH ALL COVE YOU HAD ASKED THE QUESTION OF NOT JUST THE CENTRAL VALLEY AYE I HAVE SINCE FOUND IN WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH FRESNO COUNTY AT THIS TIME. THAT'S NOT MOVING FORWARD BUT WE'RE STILL TALKING WITH THEM WE ACTUALLY HAD SIX APPLICANTS FOR FIVE OPPORTUNITIES ON THE ALCOVE SITE BUT IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES AND WHAT I'LL SAY THEY'RE RELATED. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS REALLY SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL PARTNERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION WHERE WE NOW. AND TO PROVIDE THE CAPACITY BUILDING SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BUILD THOSE OUT OVER TIME. SO OFTEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE UNIQUE NEEDS AND COUNTIES BUT WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT MANY COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH SIMILAR CHALLENGES. HOW CAN WE CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO LEARN TOGETHER AND STARTING WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SAYS THE CORE OF THE HUB OF THAT SYSTEM BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING AS YOU HEARD TODAY WITH ALL CHILDREN THRIVE. ON SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH THAT THERE ARE OTHER KEY PARTNERS AS WELL. SO WE'RE DOING THAT WORK ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS. WITH A FOCUS ON FIDELITY TO THE MODEL DEVELOPING CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES. THAT CLOSELY. AND COMPETENTLY CRITICALLY APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES ENSURING A SUSTAINABLE FINANCING REALLY WORKING WITH ALL PAIRS AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER MAKING IT EASY TO DO. IF WE WANT TO SCALE THIS NEEDS TO BE EASY. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE IN TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THAT APPLIES BOTH TO THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS WORK AND THE YOUTH DROP IN WORK THE ALCOVE WORK- IN ADDITION TO THAT WORK I'D SAY WE'VE WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH. SOME IN THE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SPACE- I'M I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT FROM THE THAT JOYCE STEWART JOHNSON C. ISSUES YOU MENTION A VOUCHER SYSTEM FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS COMMUNITY BASED CARE. PART OF OUR WORK IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS ALSO ARE COUNTY RESIDENTS. IN IN SO HOW DO WE BUILD STRATEGIES THAT THIS IS THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH YOU SEE. THROUGH CSU AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN TAP INTO THE COMMUNITY BASED SYSTEM OF CARE IN A SEAMLESS MANNER RIGHT. JUST LIKE OUR SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH WORK WHERE K. TWELVE IS A SYSTEM TO ENGAGE YOUNG PEOPLE THEIR FAMILIES TO BETTER IDENTIFY NEEDS TO CREATE NOT JUST. A POINT TO ACCESS SERVICES BUT A POINT TO NAVIGATE THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHERE NECESSARY RIGHT NOW OTHER WORDS WE WANT SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH TO FEED PEOPLE INTO YOUTH DROP IN WHERE NECESSARY. AND FOR ME IT'S DROPPING INTO EARLY PSYCHOSIS THAT IS FOR NECESSARY. OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS NEED TO BE ESSENTIAL NODES IN THAT SYSTEM SO THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AREN'T HAVING TO NAVIGATE. A NINE MONTH DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM BUT IN THE SUMMERS WHEN THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ATTENDING UC MERCED BUT THEY LIVE IN SAN DIEGO. THEY'RE OFF CAMPUS AND SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SEAMLESS CARE THAT IS INTEGRATED AND COORDINATED REGARDLESS IF THEY'RE ON CAMPUS OR AT HOME. TRANSITIONING BETWEEN WHAT'S AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CAMPUS SITE YOU KNOW THE COMMUNITY SITE POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS IN THAT REGARD BUT THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER CHALLENGES REALLY HAVE SHORT CIRCUITED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS. AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE THAT SEAMLESS SYSTEM. THAT BEGINS WITH THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. N. AND RECOGNIZES BOTH THE CALENDAR OF THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT THE COLLEGE IS A POINT IN TIME. IN THE IN THE LIFESPAN OF A STUDENT. AND SO A YOUNG PERSON WHO SERVED IN A COUNTY THAT MOVES ON TO A CAMPUS PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTY SHOULD HAVE A CONTINUITY OF CARE AND WHEN THEY GRADUATE ARE TRANSITION. OFF OF ONE CAMPUS BACK IN A COMMUNITY THAT THAT CARE DOES ISN'T DROPPED. AND THEN RESTARTED BUT IT'S THAT SEAMLESS FLOW THROUGH A PUBLIC SYSTEM OR WITH SUPPORT FROM THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. THAT IS REALLY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS- SO YOU KNOW WE STARTED SOME OF THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE WERE NOT ABLE TO BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD SUCCESS IN THAT REGARD ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT GENIE CAN HE HEARD TODAY AND WOULD BE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN EXPLORING HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THAT CONNECTION BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE BEST ADVANTAGE GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK SO TO SPEAK FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. WE'RE NOT DUPLICATING SYSTEMS BUT WE'RE ACTUALLY CONNECTING AND INTEGRATING WHERE NECESSARY THANK FOR THE MONTHS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A CHANCE TO TALK WITH YOU THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM MARNIE SANDOVAL DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE MONTEREY COUNTY. HEALTH DEPARTMENT. ANY CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE AS SURE AS SHARED EARLIER. ON EARLIER PANELS THIS EVENING ON WHERE YOU STAND ABOUT. THAT WE NEED YOUR- HELP- MONTEREY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S. HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK TO THE EXPERIENCE OF COUNTIES IN SERVING TRANSITIONING TO YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING. AND. ALLOWING US TO SERVICE POPULATION. THE NEW OF THIS POP OF YOUTH OUR COMPLEX AND CAN OFTEN INVOLVE EXTREMELY HIGH RISK AND LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS. THROUGH THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND SERVICES OR CSS COMPONENT OF MHSAA WHICH IS THE LARGEST POOL OF FUNDING ARE UNDER MHSAA COUNTY HAVE DEVELOPED FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS OR FS NEEDS. WHICH TARGET TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AND ARE CRITICAL TO SERVING THE NEEDS OF YOUTH WITH SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN ALL COUNTIES. IN ADDITION M. HSA FUNDS HAVE REALLY BEEN ESSENTIAL IN HELPING COUNTIES TO BUILD OUT ADDITIONAL TAPE FOCUSED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS TARGETED PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIGHER EDUCATION. BUILDING OUT THE STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMMING ON THE ALCOVE INNOVATION PROJECT IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY WHICH THE COMMITTEE HAS HEARD ABOUT FROM SEVERAL PANEL MEMBERS INCLUDING THE COURAGEOUS YOUTH ANALYSTS THIS EVENING. AT THE LGBTQ CLASS NETWORK OF THE PERMANENT CARE YOUR MONTEREY COUNTY ON PARTNERSHIP WITH EPICENTER WHICH IS A MONTEREY COUNTY YOUTH LED ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON EMPOWERING AT RISK AND SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR. I AND ALSO ARE MOBILE RESPONSE TEAM IN COORDINATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN MONTEREY COUNTY TO REALLY MINIMIZE THE CRIMINALIZATION OF OUR YOUTH WHERE THERE ARE UNDERLYING. HEALTH CONDITIONS. WITH RESPECT THE- WITH HIGHER EDUCATION THESE ARE LIMITED IN THE SENSE THAT COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDING TO BUILD OUT INTENTIONAL PROGRAMS. HOWEVER WHERE THEY DO HAPPEN COUNTIES HAD MORE ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGES I REQUEST THIS MAKES SENSE GIVEN THAT OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY AND PAPER I'LL- IS TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR CSU AND UC CAMPUSES I'M HOWEVER- AND THAT MAY EXTEND THEIR SERVICES TO OAKLAND COMMERCIALLY INSURED SURE STUDENTS. WITH MHSAA AND REALIGN FUNDS WERE AVAILABLE. I IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY PARTNERED WITH BOTH THEIR CSU AND LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO SUPPORT BLACK INDIGENOUS. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THEIR STUDENT BODY AND HIGHER EDUCATION THROUGH AN HSA FUNDS. WERE ALSO THE DRUG MEDI CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM OR THE TNC ODS IS AN OPTIONAL COUNTY MEDIC HOW BENEFIT. AND RESIDENTIAL S. U. D. TREATMENT IS A RELATIVELY NEW BENEFIT THROUGH THE ODS HOWEVER SO SOBRE HOUSING IS NOT FUNDED THROUGH THIS INSURANCE. I'M SO CURRENTLY THIS UNDERDEVELOPED S. U. D. CARE SYSTEM FOR YOUNG ADULTS LEAVING YOU AT ONGOING. RISK FOR NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. BECAUSE A MAJORITY OF ALL AN HSA FUNDING IS TARGETED TO SUPPORT FSP IS THE TALE FSP IS A COMMON MODEL ACROSS OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. PLANS IN COUNTIES. COUNTIES ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO BUILD OUT A NETWORK OF EARLY PSYCHOSIS SPECIALTY CARE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. PRIMARILY FUNDED THROUGH AN HSA INNOVATIONS AND PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION DOLLARS ONCE A PROGRAM HAS BEEN SET UP IT CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE SUPPORTED TO SOME DEGREE WITH MEDIC HOW FEDERAL MATCH AS WELL. ALTHOUGH NEEDS TO GO FAR BEYOND OUT I'M SIGNIFICANT GAPS DO ACTUALLY EXIST IN MOST COUNTIES FOR INDIVIDUAL WITH COMMERCIAL COVERAGE SO PARITY CONTINUES TO BE AN ISSUE. COUNTIES MAYES CIRCLES INDIVIDUALS IF FUNDING IS AVAILABLE BUT WITH THE MANY COMPETING PRIORITIES HIGHLIGHTED TODAY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR COMMERCIAL PLAN PARTNERS ALSO INVEST THEIR RESOURCES IN BUILDING UP THESE PROGRAMS. SO TODAY MORE THAN THIRTY COUNTIES HOW BUILT OUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS ON THE REASONS THAT WE DO NOT YET HAVE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS IN EVERY COUNTY IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS REALLY ARE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED. AND AS WITH SPECIALTY CARE AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO BUILD OUT SPECIALTY PROGRAMS IN SPARSELY POPULATED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST AND THE NEED TO ATTACK ATTRACT THE RIGHT KIND OF WORK WORK FORCE TO RURAL COMMUNITIES. OR REGIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT WORKFORCE SHORTAGES I'M FOR EXAMPLE THE LOWER SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGION OF OUR STATE. THAT SAID OUR WORLD COUNTIES DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN BUILDING OUT EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS IF THEY CAN BE ADAPTED TO MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. I DO WANNA MENTION TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN A CRITICAL LIFELINE FOR THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE MEANS AND A SAFE SPACE TO EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE VIA TELEHEALTH. IT IS HOWEVER A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT ALL YOU CAN OR WANT TO ENGAGE VIA TELEHEALTH. WELL IT IS ABSOLUTELY AN IMPORTANT TOOL IS ONE THAT WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS NOT TO OVERSTATE. IF YOU CONSIDER FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WERE ENGAGING YOU FOR VIRTUALLY TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PREFERENCES IT WOULD LIKELY HEAR A STRONGER PREFERENCE FOR TELEHEALTH. BUT THE VOICE OF YOUTH WITH ALTERNATE PREFERENCES WOULD BE ABSENT IN SUCH A VIRTUAL FORUM. ASIDE FROM THE DIGITAL DIVIDE A YOUNG PERSON EXPERIENCING ANXIETY PARANOIA OR HALLUCINATIONS MAY HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS EXACERBATED TELEHEALTH PROVIDING ACCESS AND RURAL CALIFORNIA LARGE NUMBERS OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES STILL LACK THE NECESSARY BROADBAND OR MOBILE PHONE ACCESS TO FACILITATE SERVICES WITH CLIENTS VIA TELEHEALTH SO CERTAINLY SOME HYBRID MODELS ARE NECESSARY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE NECESSARY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF OUR TAPE POPULATION REALLY CAN'T BE EMPHASIZED ENOUGH FUNDING AND RESOURCES MUST CONTINUE TO BE ALLOCATED FOR BUILDING AND SUSTAINING CRITICAL MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING IF WE ARE ABLE TO HELP ARE YOU REACH HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVE ADULT LIVES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY THIS LABEL AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MAX WE WILL HEAR FROM CHRISTINE STONER MERTZ CEO FOR THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR. CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES PLEASE BEGIN I'M CRISTINA MARKETS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD FAMILY SERVICES REPRESENTING. A HUNDRED AND SIXTY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DOING COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES- AS WITH THE K. TWELVE EFFORTS THE EXPANSION OF CAMPUS BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THIS POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT IN THE IN THE FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES AND THE VISION OF THE CHILDREN IN YOUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. INITIATIVE WE ALSO- AS HAS BEEN STATED BY OTHER PANELISTS HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THESE SERVICES ARE INTEGRATED WITH OTHER SUPPORTS SUCH AS HOUSING AND ECONOMIC SUPPORTS FOR THE FOR THIS POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WITH THE EMPHASIS ON CAMPUS BASED SERVICES THE- WE NEED TO ALSO ATTEND. TO THE NEED FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIRST STE YOUTH WHO ARE IN EXTENDED FOSTER CARE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OR YOUNG ADULTS INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WE CONTINUE TO SEE A DEARTH OF AVAILABLE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THAT ARE ACCESSING HOUSING THROUGH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THESE USE DO HAVE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE ALL- THE PST T. MEDICAL. UNTIL THEIR TWENTY FIRST BIRTHDAY SO WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING THEM ASIDE IS WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF YOU. ACROSS THE CONTINUUM. THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AVAILABLE THREE PST T. MATA CAL IN THE ADULT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM REALLY DOES CREATE A CLIFF FOR MANY YOUNG DULTS THAT HAVE TO TRANSITION FROM ACCESSING A WIDER RANGE OF SERVICES TO REDUCE THAT ARE AVAILABLE SUPPORT WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER EFFORTS ON HOW WE CAN EXPAND RESOURCES FOR THESE YOUNG ADULTS AT THIS VERY VULNERABLE STAGE. THE CURRENT INVESTMENT CERTAINLY BEGIN TO ADDRESS THAT NEED BUT WE NEED TO STAY COMMITTED TO ON GOING SUPPORTS BOTH ON CAMPUSES AND THREE TARGETED EFFORTS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND FOR L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS- WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS ON ENGAGEMENT WITH MANAGED CARE WITH COMMERCIAL INSURANCE AS MISTER EWING BROUGHT UP WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S PARITY BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SYSTEMS- AND AS I STATED EARLIER WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT ALL THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. AND UTILIZING IT MOST EFFECTIVELY TO GET EVERY DIFFERENT POTS TO INSURE THAT WE ROUTE WE'RE COVERING ALL OUR BASES. AND THEN FINALLY AS THE YOUTH PANELISTS US SO ELOQUENTLY COMMUNICATED WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. BOTH STUDENTS AND OTHER TRANSITION AGED YOUTH ARE AT THE CENTER OF BUILDING SERVICE MODELS THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM GENET SANA PITON THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR DPA. I'M GOOD EVENING JANET SEVENTEEN WITH DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE- I AM HERE TO DISCUSS SUBSTANCE USE AMONG YOUNG ADULTS AND APPROACHES AND STRATEGIES THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD INVEST IN FOR YOUTH AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE. NATIONALLY OVER FIVE POINT ONE MILLION YOUNG ADULTS REPORTED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER YET 87% WERE UNTREATED IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND 261715% OF YOUNG ADULTS REPORTED USING SUBSTANCES INCLUDING ALCOHOL OR DRUGS. SEVEN POINT 9% USED ILLICIT DRUGS AND POINT NINE REPORTED USING PAIN MEDICATIONS- THESE NUMBERS OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED WITH THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC- BUT ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS COMPRISED. OF FOUR THOUSAND FATAL OVERDOSES BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE OVERDOSE MORTALITY RATE FOR THOSE UNDER TWENTY HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST TWO DECADES NONFATAL OPIOID OVERDOSE IS A CRITICAL TOUCH POINT WHEN YOU I'VE NEVER RECEIVED A DIAGNOSIS FOR OPIATE DISORDER AND CAN BE ENGAGED IN TREATMENT. APPROACHES FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH OR T. FOR SHORT MUST INCLUDE ACCESS TO WRAP AROUND SERVICES FOR THOSE SEEKING SUBSTANCE TREATMENT. AS WELL AS- ACCESS TO MEDIC MEDICAL ASSISTED TREATMENT AND PROPER COMMUNITY AND FAMILY SUPPORTS JUST LAST YEAR THE FORMER CHAMP CISCO CITY ATTORNEY ATTEMPTED TO USE CIVIL INJUNCTIONS TARGETING DRUG SELLERS WERE MOSTLY YOUNG KIND DURING USE. AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE WITH THIS APPROACH FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT FRAMING PEOPLE WHO SELL DRUGS AS PERPETRATORS AND PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS AS VICTIMS IS MISGIDED BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXTREME OVERLAP BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS. A TWENTY TWO WELL SURVEY FOUND THAT 43% OF PEOPLE WHO REPORTED SELLING DRUGS IN THE PAST YEAR ALSO REPORTED THAT THEY MET THE CRITERIA FOR A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IT IS HARD TO DRAW THE LINE BETWEEN DRUG SELLERS AND USERS OFTEN. IT IS THE SAME POPULATION IN NEED OF SERVICES AND IT IS A POLICIES TO AT LOW LEVEL DRUG SELLERS IS A FAILED POLICY. THIS EXAMPLE ALSO RACIALIZED AS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS AND IT'S GROUPS OF YOUTH AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND GROUP BEING YOUTH FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. AS LEICESTER SERVING ACCESS TO TREATMENT OR SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THIS AGE GROUP INCLUDE ADOPTING POLICIES LIKE SB SEVENTY THREE BY SENATOR SCOTT WIENER PASSED LAST YEAR TO UNTIE THE HANDS. OF JUDGES TO APPLY MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND ALLOW JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO ORDER PROBATION ALLOWING INDIVIDUALS TO ACCESS TO ENTER TREATMENT WITH PROPER SOCIAL SUPPORTS IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS AND PASSING SB FIFTY SEVEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NEW YORK CITY WITHOUT STATE OR FEDERAL AUTHORIZATION OPEN UNTIL OPEN TO OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS AND WITHIN THE LAST TEN WEEKS IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE I'VE BEEN ABLE TO REVERSE OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY OVERDOSES. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT AND CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD. AND BE ONE OF THE LEADS- TO ACT UPON. THIS CRISIS AND REALLY YOU KNOW USE EVERY TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX TO IT YOUR DRESS THE OVERDOSE CRISIS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WE ALSO NEED ACCESS TO NALOXONE AND ARKANGEL REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF AN OVERDOSE- AND ENSURED THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AGAIN ARE. ARE GETTING ACCESS TO THINGS LIKE MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT AND FEDERAL TESTING STRIPS AND ALSO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE HARM REDUCTION STRATEGIES AND ACCESS FOR YOUNG FOLKS. OUT WE ALSO NEED TO DESIGN INTERVENTIONS FOR YOU OR AND HOWLS ON FOSTER USE THE L. G. B. T. Q. I A YEAR YOUR CAR VICTIMS OF CRIME AND TRAFFICKING AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED YOU. AS WELL AND FINALLY ENSURING ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED IN A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE MANNER AND IN LANGUAGE FOR CALIFORNIANS YOUNG ADULT POPULATION. SIMPLY REPEATING THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS APPROACH BY INCARCERATING OUR WAY OUT OF IT. UTILIZING ABSTINENCE ONLY APPROACHES AND FORCING PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT OF COURSE OF MODELS FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ROAD TO RECOVERY IS A TRAJECTORY AND WE MUST INVEST IN APPROACHES THAT ARE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TO WORK BEYOND THE LOCK THEM UP APPROACH AGAIN A HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST TO THE OVERDOSE CRISIS AND WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. REMOTE POLICIES THAT CONTINUE TO CRIMINALIZE IS DIGNITARIES INDIVIDUALS AND INSTEAD WE MUST ADOPT A PUBLIC. HEALTH APPROACH TO SAVE LIVES. RATHER THAN. REVERT TO CRIMINAL. AND STIGMATIZATION THANK. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM TYLER RINDE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES PLEASE BE ON. GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS TYRANT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CASH HE CAN APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE YOU SPEAKERS TODAY AND AGREE WITH A LOT OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE SHOULD BE INCLUSIVE OF YOUR VOICES AND OUR POLICY MAKING PROCESS. I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY WE FIND THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF SERVICES AVAILABLE OR SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO YOU TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS. OFTEN WE FIND THAT YOUNG ADULTS ARE PLACED INTO YOU AND ADULTS AND STOMP IT DOESN'T ALWAYS RESPOND WELL TO THAT HAVE BEEN A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD SAID IN A GROUP COUNSELING SESSION WITH FORTY TO FIFTY YEAR OLDS IT'S NOT CONDUCIVE OR BENEFICIAL TO THE INDIVIDUAL'S RECOVERY. THE YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCE INSTRUCTORS AND LIFE EXPERIENCES DO NOT RATE BY EACH ABOUT. FORTY TO FIFTY YEAR OLD. WE WOULD HOPE THAT THERE'D BE SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO YOUNG ADULTS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THROUGH THE CHILDREN YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE SERVICES NEED TO BE DESIGNED TO MEET YOUR WEATHER APP INCLUSIVE TRANSAMINASE AND PROVIDE WRAPAROUND CO OCCURRING SERVICES OR MENTAL HEALTH. AS WELL AS AUCTOR CONNECT YOU TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING I'M TRANSITION AGE YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS ARE AT PARTICULARLY HIGH RISK FOR OVERDOSE AND WITH SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE EAST ACCESS DRUGS THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA AND TRAPNELL AND LOCAL TRADING THE TRUCK SUPPLY. THERE HAS BEEN AN IMPACTING FAMILIES ACROSS SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS YOU'VE BEEN FAMILIES MAY NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE OR YOU MAY NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT THEY'RE BUYING AND STUFF EDUCATION HARM REDUCTION AND SERVICES ARE CRITICAL- ONE OF THE RECENT POLICY CHANGES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IT'S BACK. YOU CAN GET- MARK STONE AND ARE CANNOT OF PHARMACY WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION DUE TO THE GREAT WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S AN INFORMATION IT'S VERY WIDELY OR WHILE NOW WHEN OR WHAT YOU KNOW NALOXONE IS USED FOR AND- YOU KNOW NEEDING TO HAVE IT- AND WHY DISTRIBUTION OUTLET. ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THE BARRIERS THAT WAS. RAISED BY- I KALI IT WOULD BE A LOT IS. UPS THESE YOU SIR. THEIR MATIC- PROVIDE EXPERT SERVICE ON UP TO AGE OF ONE. WHILE WE KNOW THAT BRAIN NOT CAN ABOUT UNTIL THEY'RE EITHER ROWDY TWENTY FIVE. MATCH SUBSTANCES CAN IMPACT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT- IN BC THIS CLASS OF ONE. YOU EXIT THE UC SYSTEM IN GOING TO BE ADULTS AND STOMP. ON THE FLIP SIDE ONE OF THE POSITIVES. THAT COVERAGE FOR SERVICES FOR THOSE THAT HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE HAVE BEEN VASTLY EXPANDED. WITH YOUNG ADULTS BEING ABLE TO STAY ON THEIR PARENTS INSURANCE UNTIL AGE TWENTY SIX WITH THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. BUT PARITY AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SB EIGHT FIFTY FIVE BY SENATOR WIENER REMAINS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT. THERE IS ACCESS TO SERVICE. DITION ONLY WHILE THERE'S BEEN MONEY AND GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THAT PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. OBGYN DR MEDIA CAMPAIGN TARGET AT YOU- TO RAISE OUR PUBLIC AWARENESS AND REDUCE STIGMA WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INVESTMENT MUST ALSO COME WITH ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT YOUR STD TREATMENT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF YOUNG ADULTS. THIS APPROACH ADDITIONALLY NEEDS TO HEAR WHAT CENTER AROUND EQUITY WITH ATTENTION ON ADDRESSING DISPARITIES. ALSO BY TWO ECHO DOT COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE WITH DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF PASSING S FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I- AS THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF PANELISTS AND PRESENTERS FOR PANEL FIVE. I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE CHAIRED TO BEGIN ASKING MY QUESTIONS. I WILL START WITH THE QUESTION FOR DIRECTOR MELISSA STAFFORD JONES IF I COULD. WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT ARE YOUNG ADULTS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THEY ARE. TWO TIMES AS LIKELY TO HAVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. BUT I'D- LIKE TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING IF I COULD JUST OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITHIN CHILDREN'S. AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU FEEL THAT THIS INITIATIVE FOCUSES SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. ON THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA. I THINK WE ARE IN THIS STAGE OF ENGAGING WITH YOUNG ADULTS IN THIS POPULATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND IN COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE POPULATION AND WE ARE COMMITTED AS YOU KNOW CHU THIS INITIATIVE ADDRESSING THE FULL CONTINUUM FROM. PENSION ALL THE WAY THROUGH TREATMENT AND SERVICES FOR ABOUT HEALTH THAT'S ACCUSED OR BEARD THAT WE ARE WE ARE TAKING ON AND WORKING WAT ARE THE CORE ISSUES AND NEEDS WHAT ARE THE KEY STRATEGIES THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO ADDRESS THEM AND HOW DO WE SUSTAIN THEM IT REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HEARING INCLUDING. ON THIS PANEL AROUND LOOKING FOR THAT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCES SINCE SO MUCH OF THE FUNDING OF THE CHILDREN YOU HAVE A HEALTH ISSUE IS BILLY CATALYTIC IN TERMS OF BUILDING. A SYSTEM I THINK WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. I WILL FOLLOW UP IN AND THIS MAY GO TO A J. C. COOPER. WE HEARD FROM A FEW PANELISTS REGARDING E. P. S. D. T. WHICH STOPS AT TWENTY ONE AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR EXTENDING THE CHILDREN'S AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE UP TO THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE. BUT I'D LIKE TO GET THE ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ON. THAT SUGGESTION OF INCREASING IT UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. FIRST SO I THINK THE REAL REASON WHY THE INITIATIVE WAS EXTENDED TO TWENTY FIVE IS BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE ON THERE- YOU KNOW. HELP COVERAGE IT INTEL ESSENTIALLY THAT TIME PERIOD SO MAKING SURE THAT- WHERE THE HEALTH COVERAGE IS. EXTENDED YOU KNOW ALL THE WAY TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX I THINK THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHY WE ENDED UP TYING TO THE TWENTY FIVE- INSTEAD OF JUST TWENTY ONE- THERE ARECLEAR ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES FOR WHERE THE CUT OFF IS RIGHT DEPENDING ON WHICH AGES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT- AND JUST A REMINDER EEST T. ONLY APPLIES TO THE MEDICAID POPULATION. AND THIS INITIATIVE IS FOR I. ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE FOR ALL PAYERS AND SO DIDN'T WANTED TO NECESSARILY BE BUILT AROUND JUST THE MEDICAID. PROGRAM BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS THE BROAD HEALTHCARE COVERAGE- TRIGGER POINT SINCE THE ALTERNATELY ALIGNED WITH THE COVERAGE FOR. YOU KNOW AT CHILDREN UNDER THEIR FAMILY'S COVERAGE UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH. OTHER QUESTIONS OFFLINE IF I CAN I DO WANT TO GET A SENSE OF HOW WE CAN MAKE MEDIC CAL MORE ACCESSIBLE TO. HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS BOTH WITHIN THE UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WE HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND WILL KNOW WHO IS. QUALIFIED FOR MEDICAL. THAT I'M WONDERING IF WORD- A SUFFICIENTLY- WORKING TO ENROLL THOSE WHO WE- KNOW SHOULD QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM AND HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT. MORE THAN HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT THEIR- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO PROBABLY CURRENTLY ARE RECEIVING MEDICARE HOW- WITHIN THOSE AT HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU I THINK THE POINT I'M TRYING TO. MAKE IS THAT WE OFTENTIMES USE THOSE FORMULAS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING SERVICES. BUT IF WE HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAMS ISN'T THERE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SIMILARLY WORK TO ENROLL THEM SO THAT WE CAN THEN HAVE. THE SERVICES THAT COME WITH MEDICARE ALL AND I'M JUST WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE YOU YOU WILL SEE FROM MY OFFICE THIS YEAR WORK IN THIS SPACE ON CALFRESH AND BELIEVE THAT IT'S- SIMILARLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO FOCUS ON MEDIC CAL WITH THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT'S- PRESENTS TO THE SEGMENTS BUT HAPPY TO. FOLLOW UP WITH MORE QUESTIONS- I. I WILL IN MY QUESTIONS OUT OF RESPECT FOR ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE LASTED THROUGH SEVEN PLUS HOURS OF HEARING THUS FAR AND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AFTERWARDS BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO- AGAIN STATE THE IMPORTANCE OF A CENTERING OUR EXPERIENCE AND TESTIMONY TODAY ON- THE YOUNG ADULTS AND STUDENTS WHO ARE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO ELEVATE THEIR VOICES AND TO BE HEARD HERE IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AT THIS YEAR. SO I WILL THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS WHO PRESENTED AND WILL NOW HELP US TRANSITION INTO PUBLIC COMMENT WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE WE WILL START WITH ANY PERSON AND PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT IN THE ROOM.
