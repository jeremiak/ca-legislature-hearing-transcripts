OF AN HOUR.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:46.566
THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE FACT

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.201
THAT OVER ONE THOUSAND NEW

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.969

LEGISLATURE THAN THEY EVER HAVE

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.249

QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:53.945
[inaudible]

00:21:54.012 --> 00:21:56.114
THIS PETRIE-NORRIS.

00:21:56.181 --> 00:21:58.417
SEC I THINK.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.485
AT THE CHAIR RAISED I THINK SOME

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:03.588
CONCERNS IN TERMS OF PROMISES

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.190
THAT HAD BEEN MADE PREVIOUSLY

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.459
AND AND NOT MET AND I THINK

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:08.126
THERE'S A RESISTANCE AND IT JUST

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.362
SORT OF POOR GOOD MONEY AFTER

00:22:10.429 --> 00:22:12.030
BAD AS THE CASE MIGHT BE.

00:22:12.097 --> 00:22:14.066
I'M I THINK YOU AS WELL LIKE

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.434
KNOWLEDGE YOU NEED TO REBUILD

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.968
KIND OF CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IN

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:18.136
THE DMV AND IN.

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.338
THE DMV'S LEADERSHIP'S ABILITY

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:21.740
TO ACTUALLY GET THINGS DONE

00:22:21.807 --> 00:22:23.308
ACTUALLY DELIVER ONE SUGGESTION

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.143
I I WOULD HAVE IS I THINK A WAY

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.878
TO REBUILD CONFIDENCE AND TRUST

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:27.779
IS.

00:22:27.846 --> 00:22:29.347
BY SETTING YOU KNOW NEAR TERM

00:22:29.414 --> 00:22:31.216
CONCRETE DELIVERABLES AND

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:34.319
MILESTONES AND I DO APPRECIATE.

00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:35.120
YOU SEEM TO HAVE A MORE

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.655
EXPANSIVE AND AMBITIOUS AGENDA

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:38.423
BUT I DO WHICH I DO APPRECIATE

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.024
BUT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY

00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:40.959
HELPFUL CERTAINLY FOR ME AND FOR

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:42.761
THIS COMMITTEE TO SAY OKAY.

00:22:42.828 --> 00:22:43.662
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:22:43.729 --> 00:22:44.830
DELIVER IN THE NEXT YOU KNOW TWO

00:22:44.896 --> 00:22:46.965
MONTHS FOUR MONTHS SIX MONTHS.

00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:48.400
AND THEN AS WE HIT THOSE

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:50.402
MILESTONES WE CAN ALLOCATE

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:52.938
ADDITIONAL FUNDING I'M IS A IS

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:53.672
IS THAT.

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:54.973
APPROACH SHOULD BE COMFORTABLE

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.743
WITH AND BE WHAT ARE THOSE

00:22:57.809 --> 00:22:58.610
CONCRETE DELIVERABLES AND

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.412
MILESTONES THAT THAT WE COULD

00:23:00.479 --> 00:23:01.947
LOOK FORWARD TO OVER THE COURSE

00:23:02.013 --> 00:23:05.851
OF THE NEXT. EIGHT TWO FOUR AND

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:07.252
SIX MONTHS.

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:08.587
I'M SO WE'RE GONNA ADDRESS A LOT

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:09.321
OF THAT I THINK SECRETARY OF

00:23:09.387 --> 00:23:10.422
ACTUAL ADDRESS SOME OF THAT WITH

00:23:10.489 --> 00:23:11.590
OF OURS FOR WORK WITH THE GOV UP

00:23:11.656 --> 00:23:12.691
STRIKE TEAM.

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.327
HEY THERE THE WAY I WOULD --

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:17.262
PROBABLY APPROACH THIS IS. ONE

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:19.464
ALTERNATIVE SERVICE -- WE REALLY

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:20.365
NEED TO MOVE FOR WITH OFFERING

00:23:20.432 --> 00:23:22.033
ALTERS SERVICES AND GET PEOPLE

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.301
OUT OF THE FIELD OFFICE.

00:23:23.368 --> 00:23:25.403
SO THE EXPANSION OF CHAOS WOULD

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.205
BE SOMETHING THAT WE CAN MEASURE --

00:23:27.272 --> 00:23:28.874
I BELIEVE ALSO THE EXPANSION OF

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:30.342
ONLINE SERVICES AND IMPROVING

00:23:30.408 --> 00:23:32.010
OUR WEBSITE SOMETHING WE CAN

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.211
MEASURE.

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:34.946
I THINK THOSE ARE ARE TERRIBLE

00:23:35.013 --> 00:23:36.214
AND THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.682
ILLUSTRATED CAPABILITY AND THEN

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:39.084
THE OTHER THING IS TO MEASURE

00:23:39.151 --> 00:23:40.185
THE TAKE UP RIGHT.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.520
I THINK YOU KNOW ARE THESE

00:23:41.586 --> 00:23:42.521
HITTING THE MARK FOR OUR

00:23:42.587 --> 00:23:44.022
CUSTOMERS DO WE SEE A TAKE

00:23:44.089 --> 00:23:47.058
OPERATE GOING ON WELL I THINK --

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.393
CHAIRMAN YOU BROUGHT UP

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.027
SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS IMPORT

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.529
TO ME IS WHAT ARE THOSE KEY

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.464
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT WE

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:54.166
NEED TO PUT IN PLACE AT THE DMV.

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.200
THAT MEASURE WERE ACHIEVING THE

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:56.768
CUSTOMER GOALS THAT WE ARE

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.504
SEEKING -- WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER

00:23:59.571 --> 00:24:00.972
TO PROCESS REAL ID WHICH

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:02.808
REQUIRES IN PERSON HANDLING

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:04.776
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. FOR US

00:24:04.843 --> 00:24:07.279
TO ISSUE A REAL ID -- I NEED TO

00:24:07.345 --> 00:24:08.513
MOVE TRANSACTION THAT

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.282
TRANSACTION SO THE FIELD OFFICE

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:12.684
SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THE

00:24:12.751 --> 00:24:13.285
VOLUME OF PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA

00:24:13.351 --> 00:24:14.820
BE COMING AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:16.254
THOSE NUMBERS -- IN FURTHER

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:18.356
DETAIL BUT EARLY PROJECTIONS I

00:24:18.423 --> 00:24:19.324
WOULD SAY ARE WE SHOULD

00:24:19.391 --> 00:24:21.393
ANTICIPATE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:24:21.459 --> 00:24:22.294
THOUSAND PEOPLE COMING IN ON AN

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.830
ANNUAL BASIS -- BONO ON A

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.698
MONTHLY BASIS ON A MONTHLY BASIS

00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:27.199
I WISH IT WAS ANNUAL.

00:24:27.265 --> 00:24:28.500
ON A MONTHLY BASIS THEY SHOULD

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:30.669
BE COMING IN SO THE MORE THAT I

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.804
CAN MOVE OUT -- AND ALLOW THE

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:34.239
FIELD OFFICE TO HANDLE COMPLEX

00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.774
TRANSACTIONS OR REAL ID

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:36.942
TRANSACTIONS.

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.443
THE MORE TIME WILL HAVE FOR

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.278
THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO LET'S

00:24:40.345 --> 00:24:42.113
MEASURE THAT I THINK THE OTHER

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.615
THING IS CALL CENTERS I THINK WE

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:44.950
NEED A MEASURE HOW QUICKLY WERE

00:24:45.016 --> 00:24:46.685
ABLE TO GO AHEAD AND SERVICE

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:47.786
PEOPLE IN THE CALL CENTER.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:49.254
WERE LOOKING AT THE ABILITY TO

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.489
HANDLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE CALL

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:53.291
CENTER ENVIRONMENT -- IN OUR NEW

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:54.960
CONTRACT WITH OUR VENDOR BUT I

00:24:55.026 --> 00:24:56.194
ALSO DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE

00:24:56.261 --> 00:24:57.929
WAITING AND IN IN A CALL CENTER

00:24:57.996 --> 00:24:59.030
ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY NEED SOME

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:01.633
IMMEDIATE ANSWERS -- SO AGAIN

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.235
PROVIDING THOSE ALTERS COULD BE

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:08.974
MEASURABLE AREAS AGAIN WHAT TO

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.608
TAKE A BREAK.

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:10.408
OUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY USING

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:11.743
THESE TOOLS DOES THIS MEET THE

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:12.878
NEEDS OF ITS NOT MEETING THEIR

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:14.246
NEEDS THAT I SAY WE STOP USING

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:14.579
IT.

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.146
BUT PERMITS MARKETING THOSE

00:25:15.213 --> 00:25:15.747
TOOLS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:16.848
KNOW THEY'RE AVAILABLE I THINK

00:25:16.915 --> 00:25:17.249
AS I POINTED OUT.

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.050
THESE ARE TOOLS ARE CUSTOMARILY

00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.051
AVAILABLE IN ANY KIND OF RETAIL

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:22.454
ENVIRONMENT OR IF YOU GO ONLINE

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.388
AND DO ANY KIND OF WORK WITH AN

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:24.155
ONLINE.

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:25.757
ENTITIES SO WHY NOT MAKE THESE

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.692
AVAILABLE FOR DMV CUSTOMERS AS

00:25:27.759 --> 00:25:30.061
WELL -- FROM THE FIELD OFFICE

00:25:30.128 --> 00:25:32.230
STANDPOINT -- WE AGREE WITH YOU

00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:33.932

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:35.066
AND DO BUSINESS PROCESS

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.368
IMPROVEMENT AND ALL OF OUR

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:37.202
OFFICES.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:38.003
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:25:38.069 --> 00:25:39.638
CAME UP IN MY MEETINGS WITH ALL

00:25:39.704 --> 00:25:41.139
OF YOU IS THOSE THAT ARE OFFICES

00:25:41.206 --> 00:25:42.774
THAT ARE HIGH PERFORMING -- WHAT

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.142
ARE THE BEST PRACTICES IN THOSE

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.410
HIGH PERFORMING OFFICES THAT

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.511
ACTUALLY COULD BE APPLIED

00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:47.846
ANOTHER OFFICES?

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.748
THERE ARE SOME NUANCES THAT WE

00:25:49.814 --> 00:25:51.249
HAVE TO BE -- MINDFUL OF NOT

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:52.851
EVERY OFFICE IS DESIGNED THE

00:25:52.918 --> 00:25:54.452

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:19.657
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:34:19.724 --> 00:34:20.958
IN THE END IN BETWEEN THAT

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:23.294
RELATIONSHIP IS THAT IS.

00:34:23.361 --> 00:34:25.396
IS THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:26.931
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN SOMETHING GOES

00:34:26.998 --> 00:34:30.401

THE DMV -- WILL NOT SPEAK FOR

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:35.173
CDT BUT WE ARE A CUSTOMER OF CD

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.008
TEAM AND THEY HANDLE -- SOME OF

00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:38.509
OUR HARDWARE AND OUR TECHNOLOGY

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.045
SUPPORT MECHANISMS -- SO WE DO

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.780
HAVE A WHAT I CALL SERVICE LEVEL

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:44.515
AGREEMENT WITH A CONTRACTUAL

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:45.116
RELATIONSHIP WITH A FOR THOSE

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:47.218
SERVICES -- AND SO THERE ARE

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.586
PROGRAMMING THINGS THAT WE ARE

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:51.155
RESPONSIBLE -- FOR AND THEN IT'S

00:34:51.222 --> 00:34:52.390
KIND OF OUR BACK UP SYSTEMS AND

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:53.825
OUR IBM SYSTEMS AND EVERYTHING

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:54.559
ELSE.

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:55.993
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT WE

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.129
HAVE A GREAT NEED TO ADDRESS --

00:34:58.196 --> 00:34:59.897
THEY ARE I THINK OUR OUTAGES

00:34:59.964 --> 00:35:03.935
POINT OUT -- WE HAVE A VERY

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:05.369
FRAGILE SYSTEM AT THE DMV -- AND

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:06.671
IT AND IT'S AN OLD SYSTEM.

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.105
SO WHEN THERE IS A WHEN THERE IS

00:35:08.172 --> 00:35:10.241
AN OUTAGE OR WHEN SOMETHING

00:35:10.308 --> 00:35:14.078
HAPPENS LIKE TODAY -- WHO DOES

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:16.614
THE CITY COMING FIX IT OR DO YOU

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:18.182
HAVE PEOPLE THAT GO AND FIX IT

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.650
WALK ME THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP

00:35:19.717 --> 00:35:20.651
ON WHAT HAPPENS?

00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:22.386
SO IT FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:25.256
SITUATION BECAUSE IT THE FAILURE

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:26.457
OCCURRED WITH THE CVT SYSTEM.

00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.359
CITY WAS ACTUALLY STAFF WAS

00:35:28.426 --> 00:35:29.227
WORKING WITH REPAIRING THE

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:30.995
SYSTEM WITH PROBABLY THE VENDOR

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:32.230
I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY BUT

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.731
PRESUME IT WAS WITH A VENDOR. TO

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.700
GO AHEAD AND REPAIR OR REBUILD

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.535
THAT SYSTEM THEY WERE THEN IN

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.270
COMMUNICATION WITH OUR IT FOLKS

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.805
WITH OF OURS WHAT WE NEEDED TO

00:35:40.872 --> 00:35:42.073
DO ON OUR SIDE.

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:43.508
AND ALSO BE ABLE TO DRESS WHAT

00:35:43.574 --> 00:35:44.842
WE COULD FROM OUR SIDE BUT WHEN

00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:46.644
WE ISOLATED AND DID SOME ROOT

00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:47.845
CAUSE ANALYSIS.

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.113
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THAT WAS

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:51.048
THE FAILURE WAS ACTUALLY WITHIN

00:35:51.115 --> 00:35:54.085
A SYSTEM AT THE END AT C. D. T. --

00:35:54.151 --> 00:35:55.720
ALL WE CAN DO THEN IS AND FORMER

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.021
STAFF AND TRY TO GO AND HANDLE

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:59.056
OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO THE BEST

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:01.492
WE CAN OUR OFFICES -- AND THEN

00:36:01.559 --> 00:36:02.793
WORK WITH THEM WITH REGARDS TO

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.562
ANY KIND OF REVIEW WE HAVE TO DO

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:05.663
OF OUR OWN SYSTEM.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.898
ON OUR SIDE SO THERE IS A

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:08.266
SEQUENTIAL ACTIVITY THAT NEEDS

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:09.467
TO TAKE PLACE AS WELL AND THEN

00:36:09.534 --> 00:36:11.202
TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:15.706
IT DOES COME UP WE HAVEN'T LOST

00:36:15.773 --> 00:36:17.174
ANYTHING AS WELL.

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.242
SO THAT JUST SIMPLE QUESTIONS

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:18.943
AND THEN WHO DO WE HOLD

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.744
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:20.978
AND IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:21.979
WHO IS OUR ULTIMATE RESPONSE WAS

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:24.649
A CITY?

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.716
YOU KNOW THAT'S A COMPLEX

00:36:25.783 --> 00:36:27.652
QUESTION I HAVE TO BE HONEST

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:30.454
WITH YOU -- IT WILL ONLY TWO

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:33.758
ENTITIES YEAH I DISEASE THE IDEA

00:36:33.824 --> 00:36:36.060
OF THE AND THERE'S DIEM.

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:37.428
AND THEN THERE IS INCREDIBLY OLD

00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:38.896
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT JUST CAN'T

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:39.564
BE SUPPORTED ANYMORE -- WE HAVE

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.666
A SYSTEM THAT IS AN IBM SYSTEM

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.268
THE IBM CAN'T SUPPORT ANYMORE.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:46.404
WE HAVE TO MIGRATE OVER TO AN

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.339
UPDATED IBM SYSTEM AND I WILL

00:36:48.406 --> 00:36:49.941
TELL YOU IT'S NOT EVEN WHERE IT

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:51.175
NEEDS TO BE BUT IT GETS US IN A

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:52.376
MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:53.377
NEED TO BE.

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:55.246
SO I CAN ALSO TELL YOU IT'S

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:58.349
AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE HAVE.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:36:59.450
PRACTICE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ON

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.052
THIS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:37:01.118 --> 00:37:02.920
HAS TO BE ADDRESSED SO THEN WHEN

00:37:02.987 --> 00:37:04.755
YOU ROLL THESE KIOSKS AND

00:37:04.822 --> 00:37:06.057
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED

00:37:06.123 --> 00:37:09.126
AT THESE TABLETS THAT -- AT THE

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:09.694
GERMAN TING TALKED ABOUT.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.929
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.364
SUPPORTED BY THIS INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:15.132
CORRECT THEY RECEIVE INFORMATION

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.368
FED FROM OUR SYSTEMS THE THE KEY

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:18.903
ALSO BASICALLY STALE SYSTEMS BUT

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:21.205
THEY DO RECEIVE INTERFACE WITH

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:22.440
OUR SYSTEM SO WE CAN PROCESS THE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.275
APPLICATION SO WHEN THE SYSTEMS

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:28.145
GO DOWN. TO THESE KIOSKS TO WORK.

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.213
THE CHAOS MINERS THEY ARE ALSO

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.247
IMPACTED I THINK TRIPLE A WAS

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:31.148
IMPACTED THE KIOSKS WERE

00:37:31.215 --> 00:37:32.883
IMPACTED.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:34.785
SO SO IT'S IT SEEMS TO ME THAN

00:37:34.852 --> 00:37:36.420
THAT.

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:39.190
THAT'S THAT WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:41.325
DOWN EVERYTHING STOPS.

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.594
AT THAT LEVEL YES.

00:37:43.661 --> 00:37:46.030
OKAY AND THEN SO WHO IS AN OLDER

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:48.566
RESPONSIBLE DENT IT SO.

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:51.135
AS A CUSTOMER CDT MARIJUANA

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:52.870
PECAN CT BUT IT'S IT'S ON IT'S

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.038
THAT NO CHOICE RIGHT.

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:56.340
IS THAT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WANT

00:37:56.407 --> 00:37:57.375
TO IMPROVE THESE THIS

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.442
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE IBM

00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:02.847
MAINFRAMES AND WHAT AND WHAT NOT.

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:03.447
DO YOU GO TO SEE THE TùAND

00:38:03.514 --> 00:38:05.683
SAY WE WANT YOU TO PURCHASE AN

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.019
UPGRADE AND AND AND AND AND

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.887
EMPLOYMENT WHAT WE WANT OR DOES

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.022
HE NEED TO COME TO YOU AND SAY

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.089
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FOR

00:38:12.156 --> 00:38:12.923
YOU.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.759
AND THEN YOU SAY YEA OR NAY.

00:38:14.825 --> 00:38:16.727
SO THAT'S A JOINT EFFORT BECAUSE

00:38:16.794 --> 00:38:18.095
THERE IS OVERSIGHT THE CITY HAD

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:21.732
CITY HAS FOR THE DMV -- BUT I

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.367
ALSO WILL TELL YOU THE APPROACH

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:25.336
THAT WE WANT TO TAKE THIS YEAR --

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:27.104
IS PUT IT OUT BECAUSE I THINK

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:28.839
TECHNOLOGY -- TECHNOLOGY IS

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:29.940
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY RICH IN

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:30.975
CALIFORNIA.

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.176
I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.644
PARTNERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:35.179
I THINK CAN ACTUALLY HELP US

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:37.081
SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS DMV AND SO

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:39.116
OUR GOAL IS TO REACH OUT. TO OUR

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.284
TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE SECTOR

00:38:40.351 --> 00:38:42.953
PARTNER TO LOOK AT SOLVING THE

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.355
TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM WITH DMV.

00:38:44.422 --> 00:38:46.390
AND SO OUR APPROACH -- IN THE

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.458
FIRST THE FRONT AND

00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.727
SUSTAINABILITY IS TO TAKE THAT

00:38:49.794 --> 00:38:53.130
STRATEGIC APPROACH AND NOT TRY

00:38:53.197 --> 00:38:54.265
TO SOLVE IT OURSELVES.

00:38:54.331 --> 00:38:54.932
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:55.533
RIGHT APPROACH I THINK IS TO

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:57.101
REACH OUT.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.703
TO OUR AGAIN ARE ARE RICH RICH

00:38:58.769 --> 00:38:59.937
TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE IN THE

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.405
PRIVATE SECTOR TO SEE IF WE CAN

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:02.239
FIGURE OUT.

00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.741
HOW TO TRANSFORM THE DMV

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.342
TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:06.844
TRANSFORMATION IT IS A FULL ON

00:39:06.911 --> 00:39:07.812
TRANSFORMATION?

00:39:07.878 --> 00:39:09.313
HOW DO WE TRANSFORM THE DMV

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.415
SYSTEMS WHILE ALSO ENSURING THE

00:39:11.482 --> 00:39:12.850
PROTECTION OF REALLY CRITICAL

00:39:12.917 --> 00:39:15.986
DATA AND THE SECURITY OF THAT

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:17.354
DATA AS WE TRANSFORM SURE?

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.723
ARE YOU SAY THIS AND I I I DO

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:19.657
WANT TO SPRING THIS ON YOU SO I

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:20.791
APOLOGIZE BUT IT'S SOMETHING

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:21.826
THEY THEY COMES UP BECAUSE

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.561
THERE'S A CLEAR PATTERN.

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:27.965
OF FAILURES HERE WHEN IT COMES

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.800
TO AND IT MAY BE.

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.402
MORE CITY THAN TO DMB SO I JUST

00:39:31.469 --> 00:39:32.036
WANT WILL THROW IT OUT THERE BUT

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:33.270
SO YOU'VE GOT THE SMART TABLETS

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.438
THAT ARE BEING ABLE MAY BE AT

00:39:34.505 --> 00:39:35.406
THE OUTAGES. TO OUTAGES THAT

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:36.974
HAPPENED TODAY AND THEN THERE

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.442
WAS A VERY CONCERNING

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.277
INVESTIGATIVE STORY IN LA TIMES

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.146
TODAY ABOUT THE MISMANAGEMENT OF

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.447
THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM AND THE

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.982
CONFUSION AND CHAOS THAT WAS

00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.417
EVIDENT AS IS ROLLING OUT.

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:48.452
AND OF COURSE THE DMV AND AND C.

00:39:48.519 --> 00:39:50.921
T. WERE INVOLVED WITH THAT ALONG

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:51.655
WITH THE SECTORS STATE.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:54.425
AND SO -- I GUESS THE CONCERN

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:57.495
FOR ME IS THAT -- AS WE ROLL OUT

00:39:57.561 --> 00:39:59.130
THESE AYE IF THE I'VE AYE IF

00:39:59.196 --> 00:40:00.364
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.967
I. T. SYSTEM IS THE CORE PROBLEM.

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:06.470
THEN AND YOU'RE ASKING. FOR TWO

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:07.171
OR FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.306
ABOVE THE EXISTING BUDGET HOW

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.775
MUCH OF THE TWO ONE FOUR TWO

00:40:10.841 --> 00:40:11.709
MILLION IS GOING TO NEW

00:40:11.776 --> 00:40:13.344
INFRASTRUCTURE AND AND I. T. PRO.

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.180
OR ARE PROVING THIS THIS -- IN

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.648
FROM IT INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:20.885
CHALLENGES THAT TURNED A ROBBIE

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.419
TO THOSE NUMBERS FOR YOU.

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:24.421
BUT TWO THINGS THAT I HOPE WILL

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:25.289
GIVE YOU SOME ASSURANCE WAYS

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.824
PULLING UP THE NUMBERS IS.

00:40:26.891 --> 00:40:28.292
I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO GIVE YOU

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.293
INSURANCE THAT'S GOING TO SPEND

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.027
APPROPRIATE PART OF ITS

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.595
ESTABLISHING A VERY STRONG

00:40:31.662 --> 00:40:33.097
GOVERNANCE ¡UCTURE

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:35.366
THAT LOOKS AT THE ENTERPRISE A

00:40:35.432 --> 00:40:37.001
MEASURES RISK.

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:37.701
MEASURE STRATEGIC GOALS AND

00:40:37.768 --> 00:40:39.170
MEASURES PERFORMANCE THE OTHER

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:40.805
PIECE THAT THEY MIGHT WANT TO

00:40:40.871 --> 00:40:42.540
BRING IT CONSULTANT -- TO HELP

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.542
WITH THAT IN PLACE IN A BET THAT

00:40:44.608 --> 00:40:46.143
INTO THE DMV ORGANIZATION.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:47.411
THE OTHER PIECE THAT I WANT TO

00:40:47.478 --> 00:40:48.646
BRING IN BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.080
OUR STRENGTH IS IN THIS AREA AT

00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.615
DMV.

00:40:51.682 --> 00:40:52.883
IS PROJECT MANAGEMENT.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:53.818
BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE OF

00:40:53.884 --> 00:40:54.718
PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE

00:40:54.785 --> 00:40:56.453
GOING ON I WANT TO HAVE STRONG

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.755
PROJECT MANAGEMENT THAT'S

00:40:57.822 --> 00:40:59.590
ACTUALLY REPORTING TO ME.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:00.558
AND THEN THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

00:41:00.624 --> 00:41:02.026
PART BUT IF THE PROJECT

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:04.328
MANAGEMENT IS AT C. T. AND C. T.

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.363
IS THE ACTUAL.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.199
PROBLEM THEN WE'VE GOT A WE'VE

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:08.866
GOT WE'VE WE'VE ACTUALLY CREATE

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:09.834
A PROBABLY MADE THE PROBLEM

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.335
WORSE CORRECT CORRECT AND I'M

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.503
NOT GOING THAT ROUTE I'M

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.370
ACTUALLY GOING OUT WITH A

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:14.638
CONTRACT TO BRING IN SOMEBODY

00:41:14.705 --> 00:41:16.640
OUTSIDE TO BE A PROJECT

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:17.842
MANAGEMENT OFFICE FOR ME A

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.577
PARTING DIRECTLY TO THE WHY.

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:20.911
DO WE HAVE THE CITY T..

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:22.012
WELL AND SUFFER I'M NOT SURE OF

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:22.813
THAT THEIR STAFF TO ACTUALLY

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.181
HANDLE THE VOLUME THAT WE'RE

00:41:24.248 --> 00:41:26.717
LOOKING AT THE DMV AND I AGAIN I

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:27.284
WOULD HAVE IS AND THIS IS A

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.118
HEARING AS EASY AS I APOLOGIZE

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:30.888
I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:32.356
UNDERSTAND AND IF IF.

00:41:32.423 --> 00:41:34.225
IF YOU COULD THE NUMBER THAT THE

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:35.926
NUMBERS SO YES SO WITHIN THE THE

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:36.760
PROPOSAL WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO

00:41:36.827 --> 00:41:37.895
ITEMS THAT ARE SO SHOULD WITH

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.163
LIFE IMPROVEMENT ONE IS.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.631
A PER I COULD REDUNDANCY WHICH

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:41.866
IS WORKING THROUGH SPEAKING

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:42.800
ABOUT FOUR POINT SIX MILLION

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:43.968
DOLLARS.

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.369
AND SO THAT'S AN ANNUAL COST

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:46.770
WHAT THAT IS IS FOR OUR LARGER

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:48.105
OFFICES GRADE THREE FOURS AND

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:48.706
FIVES.

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.140
SMALLER OPPOSITE R. GRADES ONE

00:41:50.207 --> 00:41:52.409
AND TWO SO THE GREAT BEFORE THE

00:41:52.476 --> 00:41:53.711
FIVE OFF THE TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:56.480
LINE COMING IN THE OFFICE SELECT

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:57.848
ONE OF THE LINES COMING FROM C.

00:41:57.915 --> 00:41:58.415
T.. FOR WHAT EVERYTHING GOES

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.217
DOWN THERE'S ANOTHER LINE THAT

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:01.352
GOES INTO THAT OFFICE.

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:02.720
THE FACT THAT OKAY TONS OF FOUR

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:04.355
POINT SIX MILLION FOR THAT AND

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:05.356
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER THREE POINT

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:07.491
ONE MILLION - FOR I KEY

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:09.026
COMPONENTS AND IT'S REALLY AN

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:11.862
ANNUAL REPLACEMENT -- AND THAT'S

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.597
FOR SERVERS ROUTERS SWITCHES

00:42:13.664 --> 00:42:15.132
THINGS ALONG THOSE LINES AS THEY

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.333
RELATE TO JUST FROM AT AN

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.701
OUTDATED A REFRESH PROCESS. TO

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:19.637
DO THAT SO THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:27.411
PART POINT WHICH I THINK IT

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:30.214
DOVETAILS INTO -- A WHAT IS A

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.582
NUMBER THAT PETRIE-NORRIS SAYS

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:32.583
THAT IF WE WANTED.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.051
MILESTONES AND METRICS SO WHAT

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:35.319
HOW MUCH WOULD IT TAKE TO FIX.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:35.786
THE I. T. PROBLEMS AND

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:36.921
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.489
NOTTHE PEACE MIL FOUR POINT SIX

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:39.623
AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION WHAT

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.191
WOULD IT TAKE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:42.059
MAY YOU YOU SAID AND RIGHTFULLY

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.527
SO IN YOUR OPENING STATEMENT

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:45.429
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE DMV

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:46.196
OF THE FUTURE.

00:42:46.263 --> 00:42:46.830
RIGHT.

00:42:46.897 --> 00:42:49.433
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN APPROVING

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.468
A BUDGET AUGMENTATION THAT

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:53.070
DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.439
SO WHAT FIXES THE PROBLEM.

00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.207
NOT MORE STAFF.

00:42:57.274 --> 00:42:59.343
BUT HOW IF INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.878
THAT THE KEY COMPONENT AND OF

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:02.313
YOUR TWO THOUSAND STAFF MEMBERS

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:04.248
CAN EVEN DO THE WORK BECAUSE THE

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.749
I. T. SYSTEM FAILED.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:07.551
AND THEY'RE SITTING THERE DOING

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:08.385
NOTHING AND THE GETTING YELLED

00:43:08.452 --> 00:43:11.388
AT BY CUSTOMERS RIGHTFULLY SO.

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.223
HOW MUCH FIXES THE PROBLEM AND

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:13.857
WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THE

00:43:13.924 --> 00:43:15.392
PROBLEM?

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:17.094
SO ALL THAT ROBBIE SPEAK TO BUT

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:19.196
I KNOW WE PUT TOGETHER A A FIVE

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.798
YEAR PLAN -- ON ADDRESSING OUR

00:43:20.864 --> 00:43:22.399
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ENTITLED

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.368
FRONT AND SUSTAINABILITY WE'VE

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:25.302
ACTUALLY HAD SOME FURTHER

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:27.137
STRATEGIC CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:30.007
THE MANNER WHICH WE'RE GOING TO

00:43:30.074 --> 00:43:33.410
MOVE FORWARD -- MY PERSPECTIVE

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:34.645
ON THIS INTO YOUR POINT AND

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.246
YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS THE FIRST

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:37.314
THING I WANT TO SEE PUT IN

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.849
PLACES ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURAL

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.783
PLAN.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.385
THAT MOVES US INTO THE FUTURE.

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:42.953
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT PLAN

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.655
RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE TO CREATE

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.223
THE ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURAL

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.125
PLAN THAT KNOWLEDGE IS ALL THE

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.293
PRODUCT LINES THAT ARE SERVICE

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.461
BY DMV.

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:51.261
AND THEN THE AGING

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.396
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW DO WE

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.531
TRANSITION FROM OUR AGING

00:43:54.598 --> 00:43:56.266
INFRASTRUCTURE TO A NEW --

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.835
SYSTEM THAT'S MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.770
NIMBLE AND AND ROBUST FOR OUR

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.805
NEEDS -- THAT'S A FIVE YEAR

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.674
PROJECT AND I THINK THE GOAL IS

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:04.942
TO TAKE AN AGILE APPROACH THAT

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:06.110
FOR THE FIRST THING IS TO COME

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:07.745
UP WITH A PLAN. TO ENSURE THE

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:08.712
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF OUR

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:12.282
SYSTEM BUT I WHENI SAID I WANT

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:12.783
TO GO OUT WITH A PROBLEM

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.617
STATEMENT.

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:14.451
IS THAT HOW DO WE GO AHEAD AND

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.286
SOLVE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:19.356
DMV TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE.

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:20.758
THAT IT ACTUALLY MEETS OUR NEEDS

00:44:20.824 --> 00:44:22.092
ON A REGULAR BASIS TWENTY FOUR

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.261
BY.

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.195
SEVEN I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER I

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.964
THINK I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:28.265
WE NEED A PLAN WE'VE BEEN

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:29.400
WAITING FOR THIS PLAN FOR VERY

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.535
LONG TIME I'M ONLY IN MY SECOND

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:32.703
TERM AND I BELIEVE THAT MY

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:34.838
PREDECESSORS HAVE BEEN WAITING

00:44:34.905 --> 00:44:35.539
FOR THAT PLAN AS WELL.

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.407
SO.

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:38.108
FROM I I'M NOT PICKING ON THE

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:39.810
DMB I'M I'M FIVE MORE PICKING ON

00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:41.311
THAT FORMER TECHNOLOGY RIGHT NOW

00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:43.147
BUT I THINK FOR US AS

00:44:43.213 --> 00:44:44.081
LEGISLATORS.

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.916
AS LEGISLATOR WARS AS STEWARDS

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:47.818
OF THE TAX DOLLAR WE HAVE TO SEE

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:49.720
THE PLAN FIRST.

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:52.756
AND SO I CAN'T WE MAKE DECISIONS

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:53.791
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE THE LAST

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:54.892
HEARING I'M I'M REPEATING MYSELF

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.493
BUT WE MAKE DECISIONS ON

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.861
IMPERFECT INFORMATION.

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.463
ALL OF US.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.464
TO AND WE KNOW ONE INCH ABOUT

00:45:00.531 --> 00:45:02.433
EVERYTHING AND SO PROVIDING US

00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:03.734
WITH ADDITIONAL INCHES OF

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:05.002
INFORMATION IS CRITICAL.

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:08.305
AND SO YOU'RE ASKING FOR TWO

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:08.839
HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION

00:45:08.906 --> 00:45:12.142
DOLLARS ABOVE IT BILLION DOLLAR

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.143
BUDGET YOU ALREADY HAVE.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.813
AND SO A YOU'VE AND ALL THE ALL

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.981
THE RESULT ALL THE REVIEWS THAT

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.750
OUTLINED THE SAME PROBLEM.

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.251
AND YOU EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:22.152
SAME PROBLEM.

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:24.988
AND AND SO IF IT'S I. T. IF IT'S

00:45:25.055 --> 00:45:27.658
CHAOS IF IT'S OUTSOURCING TO THE

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:29.560
TRIPLE A OR EVERYTHING THAT ARE

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.428
ALL THE THINGS WE THAT'S

00:45:31.495 --> 00:45:32.563
INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN.

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:34.098
THEN JUST TELL US THE PLAN.

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:35.799
AND WE CAN EVALUATE WHAT THAT

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.367
PLAN IS AND THEN WE CAN

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:38.502
DETERMINE WHETHER WE SHOULD

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.003
FUNDED AT THAT LEVEL.

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.371
BUT IF YOU'RE PIECE MILLING IT

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:43.307
AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS APPROVING

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.141
TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.742
MILLION DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.010
YEAR ON TOP OF THE BILLION

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:49.046
DOLLARS AND AT THE END OF THE

00:45:49.113 --> 00:45:50.414
DAY THAT DOESN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:51.715
WITHIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:52.983
GONNA DO YOU WHEN WE COME BACK

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.886
NEXT YEAR AND WE'RE HAVING THIS

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:56.753
EXACT SAME HEARING.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.989
AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:02.292
THE PROBLEM IS TECHNOLOGY AND CD

00:46:02.359 --> 00:46:03.861
T. ISN'T DOING THEIR JOB.

00:46:03.927 --> 00:46:05.529
AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN YOU'RE

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:06.163
GOING TO DO AN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:07.998
PROJECT WERE NOT EVEN GOING TO

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:09.967
USE C. D. T. YOU'RE GONNA CREATE

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:12.102
YOUR OWN SYSTEM WITH YOUR OWN I

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.937
KEY PEOPLE THAT WE'VE CREATED

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:14.805
MULTIPLE.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.540
AGENCIES AND MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGY

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:18.375
DEPARTMENTS AND THAT SEEMS

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:19.910
INEFFICIENT TO ME AND A WASTE OF

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:23.514
TAXPAYER DOLLARS SO I HOPE THAT.

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.348
OVER TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO SIT

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.250

IN TERMS OF WORKING OUT A LONG

00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:30.154
TERM PLAN AND IF THE GOAL AND WE

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.555
ALL SHARE THIS GOAL IS TO

00:46:31.622 --> 00:46:33.457
DEVELOP A DMB OF THE FUTURE THAT

00:46:33.524 --> 00:46:34.825
WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THAT

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:35.726
CUSTOMERS WILL.

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.528
BE PROUD TO GO INTO OR NOT GO

00:46:37.594 --> 00:46:38.962
INTO AS WE HOPE THEY PROBABLY

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:42.299
DON'T GO INTO NOW -- THAT WE CAN

00:46:42.366 --> 00:46:43.767
FIGURE THAT OUT SO I I

FUNDAMENTALLY FOR THE FOR THE

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:27.110

I THINK YOU HAVE THOSE FOLKS IN

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:44.628
PLACE ALREADY THERE IN THE STATE

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:46.263

I'VE BEEN TOLD WITH THE REAL ID.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:47:58.875
AND WITH THE CUT THE OTHER I

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:01.612
CAN'T THINK OF WHAT IT WAS.

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:02.713
THE SIXTY OF THEM.

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:04.248
YEAH MOTOR VOTER WILL NOT MOTOR

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:06.116
VOTER THAT'S IT SO WAS THE SAME

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:06.416
[inaudible]

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:07.684
CHIEF.

00:48:07.751 --> 00:48:09.419
OVER THOSE BOTH PROJECT MANAGERS

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:12.322
FOR THOSE PROJECTS.

00:48:12.389 --> 00:48:12.889
THE CHECKS AND SHE FROM YOUR

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:13.824
AGENCY.

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.325
I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA BUT

00:48:15.392 --> 00:48:16.226
WHAT I WILL TELL YOU FROM A

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:19.396
STAFF STANDPOINT OR A TEA SHOP --

00:48:19.463 --> 00:48:21.198
IS WE DO NEED TO MODERNIZE THAT

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:23.500
OPERATION -- I'M ALSO FACE WAS

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.801
SOME SUCCESSION PLANNING ISSUES

00:48:24.868 --> 00:48:26.570
THAT WAS NOTED IN THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.572
OF FINANCE AUDIT -- SO I NEED TO

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:29.940
BE LOOKING AT WHO DO I NEED TO

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:30.974
RECRUIT IN YOUR RIGHT PROJECT

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:32.242
MANAGEMENT I CAN GO OUT AND

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:33.410
RECRUIT.

00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:34.678
FOR BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I HAVE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.579
AN IMMEDIATE NEED WITH A

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.180
MULTITUDE OF PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:48:37.247 --> 00:48:38.882
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.851
WITH SOME STAFFING VACANCIES

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.986
THAT I HAVE BUT I ALSO WANT TO

00:48:43.053 --> 00:48:44.788
GIVE SOME ASSURANCE -- TO THOSE

00:48:44.855 --> 00:48:46.456
WHO QUESTION OUR CAPABILITY TO

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:47.924
DO THE JOB IS TO BRING SOMEBODY

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.993
OUTSIDE TO DO THE JOB BUT I ALSO

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.461
SEE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME

00:48:51.528 --> 00:48:52.896
POWERFUL KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER.

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:53.964
I THINK OUR FOLKS NEED THAT

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.499
SKILL SO ANY CONTRACT THAT I

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:57.000
WOULD GO OUT WITH AND HAVE

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:58.235
SOMEBODY COME IN AND DO PROJECT

00:48:58.302 --> 00:48:59.336
MANAGEMENT IS WITH THE

00:48:59.403 --> 00:49:00.404
FUNDAMENTAL GOAL.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.805
OF DEVELOPING MY STAFF AT THE

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.140
SAME TIME WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:04.041
TRANSFER THAT THEY NEED TO DO

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:04.775
THAT WORK.

00:49:04.841 --> 00:49:06.443
AND WE NEED TO PROBABLY RE

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:08.078
EXAMINE HOW WE HANDLE PROJECTS

00:49:08.145 --> 00:49:09.112
AT DMV.

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.380
THAT'S BEEN SOME OF CHALLENGES

00:49:10.447 --> 00:49:11.181
WE HAVE BUT ONE OF THE

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:13.150
CHALLENGES WE HAVE FOR TV AGAIN

00:49:13.216 --> 00:49:15.285
BECAUSE OF OUR A LEGACY SYSTEM.

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:16.386
WE DON'T GIVE OURSELVES ENOUGH

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.789
TESTING TIME TO TEST SOMETHING

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.691
BEFORE WE LAUNCH IT -- AND

00:49:20.757 --> 00:49:21.692
THAT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE WHEN

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:23.293
WE'VE LOST SOME OF OUR PROJECTS

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.196
TO SOME OF THE UNFORESEEN --

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:27.831
GLITCHES AND ROLLING OUT

00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.499
SOMETHING BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:32.803
OF VERY OLD ASSEMBLER KAULBACH

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:33.937
COATS WE HAVE WITH THE DMV.

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:36.406
SO YOU HAVE SOME THE OLDEST --

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:40.844
NETWORKING SYSTEMS COMPUTER

00:49:40.911 --> 00:49:42.579
SYSTEMS IN THE STATE.

00:49:42.646 --> 00:49:43.847
IS THAT CORRECT THERE IS MY

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:45.282
UNDERSTANDING YES AND I KNOW YOU

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:46.216
THE ACTING DIRECTOR RIGHT NOW

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:46.850
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WITH THE

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:48.151
IN BEFORE.

00:49:48.218 --> 00:49:49.419
US SINCE FEBRUARY FIRST OKAY THE

00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:50.654
MINARET Là BUT A LOT OF FOLKS

00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:51.788
HAVE BEEN FOLKS COME AND GO BUT

00:49:51.855 --> 00:49:52.689
STILL YOU'RE YOU'RE MIDDLE

00:49:52.756 --> 00:49:53.523
MANAGEMENT THE CRUX THEY RUN THE

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.391
DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS.

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.359
THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN THERE A

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:56.793
LONG TIME AND YOU KNOW WE TALK

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.095
ABOUT STRATEGIC GOALS THESE ARE

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.896
GREAT WORD PHRASES AND AND CATCH

00:49:59.963 --> 00:50:02.265
PHRASES BUT ULTIMATELY COME DOWN

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:03.967
TO LEADERSHIP DOING THAT IT.

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:04.468
REALLY STARTS AND WITH

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.470
ACCOUNTABILITY SO THE HARD PART

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:08.271
IS WITH A LOT OF MONEY.

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:09.473
AT DMV YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:11.708
MONEY MORE PERSONNEL IT'S REALLY

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.410
HARD TO HAVE CONFIDENCE BECAUSE

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:14.578

WITH RESPECT TO REAL ID AND YOUR

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:52.309

ASK A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:55.812
QUESTIONS THERE AND THEN LATER.

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.914
WHEN THE SECRETARY AB THE

00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:00.217
BACHELOR IS HERE -- I WANT TO

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.985
TALK ABOUT WHAT THE THAT THE

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:03.453
ENVY OF THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.622
AND THEN JUST KIND OF SETTING

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.257
THE STAGE HERE.

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:09.092
I REALLY THINK WE HAVE GOT TO

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:12.128
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A HUGE

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.864
PROBLEM NOW.

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.932
AND YET THERE I BELIEVE THERE IS

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:17.667
A POTENTIAL IN A POSSIBILITY TO

00:52:17.734 --> 00:52:21.004
GET TO A D. M. V. OF THE FUTURE.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.906
BUT THE CHALLENGE YOU HAVE IT

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:25.242
SEEMS TO ME IS YOU ARE IN THE

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:27.677
MIDDLE OF KEEPING A D. M. V.

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.946
OPERATING WHILE YOU ARE TRYING

00:52:30.013 --> 00:52:32.148
TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU ENTIRELY

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.884
RE ENGINEERING.

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:36.186
SO UNLESS WE'RE WILLING TO SAY

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:36.920
WE'RE GOING TO SHUT IT DOWN

00:52:36.987 --> 00:52:39.155
TODAY TURN IT OFF FOR AWHILE AND

00:52:39.222 --> 00:52:40.757
THEN FIX IT.

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.826
I'M THAT'S NOT REALISTIC EITHER

00:52:42.893 --> 00:52:44.127
SO WE'VE GOT THE PROBLEM OF

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.695
TODAY.

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:46.830
BUT THEN I THINK THERE'S AN

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.198
OPPORTUNITY OF TOMORROW AND I

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.232
WANT TO ADDRESS THAT A LITTLE

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.734
BIT WITH.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.602

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.707
ON THE PLAN.

00:52:57.774 --> 00:52:58.475
WITH HOME.

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.477
OF SILICON VALLEY.

00:53:00.544 --> 00:53:03.780
UP WE ARE -- THE STATE THAT HAS

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:06.716
REALLY DEMONSTRATED WHAT.

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:10.053
TECHNOLOGICAL AND AIDED CUSTOMER

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.755
SERVICE REALLY LOOKS LIKE. FOR

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:16.259
EXAMPLE AMAZON OR ANY OF THE

00:53:16.326 --> 00:53:18.161
OTHER LARGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:19.829
ARE.

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.631
AND SO I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.667
TALK ABOUT RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.234
WITH A COUPLE OF ISSUES OF

00:53:24.301 --> 00:53:25.335
CONCERN.

00:53:25.402 --> 00:53:26.636
AND THEN LATER I WANNA EXT I

00:53:26.703 --> 00:53:28.872
WANT TO REALLY EXPLORE WHAT THE

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.040
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DMV.

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.808
CAN LOOK LIKE.

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.476
I WANT TO SAY ALSO FROM THE

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:35.378
OUTSET THAT I APPRECIATED YOUR

00:53:35.445 --> 00:53:37.347
VISIT WITH ME YESTERDAY.

00:53:37.414 --> 00:53:39.649
AND WE HAD SOME VERY YOU GOT

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.184
DIRECT CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS.

00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:44.988
AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT I AM MORE

00:53:45.055 --> 00:53:47.624
ENCOURAGED NOW -- THAN I WAS

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.326
WHEN THE GOVERNOR INITIATE THAT

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.294
THE PREVIOUS GOVERNOR INITIATED

00:53:51.361 --> 00:53:53.730
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A RATHER LATE

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.165
AND SORT OF LACKLUSTER APPROACH

00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.633
TO THIS.

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.335
WHAT WE DO HAVE NOW IS A

00:53:58.401 --> 00:54:00.303
GOVERNOR WHO IN MY ESTIMATION

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.405
JUMPED OUT VERY EARLY ON THIS IN

00:54:02.472 --> 00:54:04.307
HIS STATE OF THE STATE?

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.509
AND HE ARE FRANKLY A APPOINTED

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:09.145
SOMEONE -- THAT I HAVE KNOWN --

00:54:09.212 --> 00:54:11.147
AND HAVE WATCHED AND UP FOR

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:11.848
SOMETIME.

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.350
AND I AND I THINK THAT SECRETARY

00:54:13.416 --> 00:54:14.651
BATCH OR WAS IT WAS A GREAT

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:15.752
CHOICE ON THIS.

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:16.853
AND I THINK THE STRIKE FORCE

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.655
REALLY DOES HAVE SOME REAL

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:19.990
OPPORTUNITIES HERE.

00:54:20.056 --> 00:54:21.858
BUT THERE IS A BIG BIG CHASM

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.928
BETWEEN WHERE WE ARE NOW AND

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:26.596
WHERE WE HAVE GOT TO GET.

00:54:26.663 --> 00:54:28.632
TO AND SO I WANT TO JUST REMIND

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.100
US THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS THE

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.701
STATE THAT HAS LED.

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:33.870
THE WORLD IN TECHNOLOGY AND YET

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:36.239
WE HAVE A DMV THAT THE

00:54:36.306 --> 00:54:38.775
INSTITUTION THAT FACES MORE

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:42.712
PEOPLE WITHOUT A ESSENTIALLY

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:44.280
ALMOST A MONOPOLY ON THEIR

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.650
SERVICE AND THEIR TIME.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:49.986
AND IT IS IN FACT.

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.688
JUST IN.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:53.990
IT IS SPECIAL NOT WORKING -- AND

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.425
WE ALL KNOW THAT WE WE WE WE'VE

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:57.127
GOTTEN TO THE POINT THAT.

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:59.262
YOU KNOW OUR BUT WHAT WE'RE

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:01.131
WE'RE WE'RE PAST THE THE

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:03.066
PATIENT'S SIDE.

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:04.334
AND YEAH I REALLY THINK THERE

00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:05.969
NEEDS TO BE A BIT OF A WAR A

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:07.470
WORD OF WARNING HERE.

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:09.572
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:11.441
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:13.777
M. YOU CAN'T JUST CLOSE THE DMV

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:14.611
DOWN.

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:15.745
YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:16.813
NOW WANT YOU YOU KNOW

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.682
DECONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT

00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:20.116
YOU CAN'T EVEN DO.

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:22.018
LIMITED FEW FUNDAMENTALS BUT

00:55:22.085 --> 00:55:24.287
THEN THERE IS THE NEXT QUESTION

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:24.854
WHAT DOES THAT TWENTY FIRST

00:55:24.921 --> 00:55:25.822
CENTURY.

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:28.058
D. M. V. LOOKS LIKE I THINK IF

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.726
YOU CAN DO AMAZON LIKE

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:33.229
TECHNOLOGY AND YOU CAN DEVELOP A

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:36.533
A DMV THAT DOESN'T JUST HAVE.

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:42.338
A YOU KNOW A REALLY UNDERSTANDS

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:44.641
THAT THE DMV SERVE THE CUSTOMER

00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:45.875
NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:55:45.942 --> 00:55:46.976
AND I'VE HEARD ALSO SOME

00:55:47.043 --> 00:55:48.978
SUGGESTIONS THAT DECENTRALIZING

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:49.813
IT.

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:52.716
ASKING YOUR PARTNERS TO DO MORE --

00:55:52.782 --> 00:55:54.017
THE TRIPLE A IS A PER PERFECT

00:55:54.084 --> 00:55:56.386
EXAMPLE THERE LOTS OF OTHER WAYS

00:55:56.453 --> 00:55:58.521
THAT YOU CAN REDUCE THE WAIT

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.556
TIMES.

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:03.193
MOVE FOLKS -- TO TO OUTSIDE --

00:56:03.259 --> 00:56:05.128
PLACES THAT'S MUCH MUCH MORE

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.430
CONVENIENT AND ACTUALLY HELPS TO

00:56:07.497 --> 00:56:08.998
CUT THOSE WAIT TIMES DOWN BUT

00:56:09.065 --> 00:56:11.735
THE TWO THINGS I WANT TO JUST

00:56:11.801 --> 00:56:13.436
ASK DIRECTLY HERE.

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.237
FROM -- SUCH A FROM MY

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:15.538
RECOLLECTION THIS IS ABOUT REAL

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:16.940
ID.

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:19.075
THE DMV HAD A PLAN TO CORRECT

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:20.777
ITS COMPLIANCE ISSUE BY APRIL

00:56:20.844 --> 00:56:22.212
FIRST.

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:24.280
BUT APPARENTLY FAILED TO MEET

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:26.883
ITS OWN DEADLINE.

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:27.851

00:56:27.917 --> 00:56:30.587
I GUESS THE THE DMV IS SAYING

00:56:30.653 --> 00:56:34.157

00:57:08.925 --> 00:57:10.660
WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:57:10.727 --> 00:57:12.362
COME INTO COMPLIANCE.

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:13.363
SO IN THE COMPLIANCE BASE WITH

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:14.564
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:16.065
SECURITY WE RECEIVED OUR LETTER

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:17.567
YESTERDAY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.702
HOMELAND SECURITY -- THEY'VE

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.005
EXTENDED OUR COMPLAINTS PERIOD

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:25.475
TILL MAY TWENTY FOURTH -- TWENTY

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:27.243
NINETEEN THEY WANT TO ACTUALLY

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:28.878
SEE US IMPLEMENTS.

00:57:28.945 --> 00:57:30.246
THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:32.182
BE MAKING BOTH FOR WHAT I CALL

00:57:32.248 --> 00:57:33.683
KIND OF GO THE SECOND GENERATION

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.318
OF GOING FORWARD WHICH IS

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.453
REQUIRING TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS.

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.455
WHERE THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT

00:57:39.522 --> 00:57:40.356
WE WAITED TO HEAR FROM HOMELESS

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:44.127
CREE SO WE KNEW HOW TO IMPLEMENT --

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.261
THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION.

00:57:45.328 --> 00:57:46.563
WAS OUR FOLKS AND I REFER TO

00:57:46.629 --> 00:57:48.097
THEM AS OUR EARLY ADOPTERS WE

00:57:48.164 --> 00:57:51.067
ROLLED OUT -- THE REAL ID BACK

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:52.535
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE WERE ONLY

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:55.271
REQUIRING ONE RESIDENCY DOCUMENT.

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:57.006
WE ACTUALLY FOLLOWED WHAT OTHER

00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:58.341
ANOTHER STATE HAD ACTUALLY DONE

00:57:58.408 --> 00:57:59.809
AND PUT THAT FORWARD AS OUR PLAN

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:01.010
GOING FORWARD.

00:58:01.077 --> 00:58:02.378
WE LATER LEARNED FROM HOMELAND

00:58:02.445 --> 00:58:03.880
SECURITY THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:04.881
THAT YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:07.383
REQUIRED TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS.

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:08.618
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ADDRESS

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:10.186
ALL THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND

00:58:10.253 --> 00:58:11.988
THERE'S ABOUT THREE POINT FOUR

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:15.625
MILLION AT THIS POINT.

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.360
THAT -- HAVE
THEIR REAL ID BUT SUBMITTED ONE

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:19.596
RESIDENCY DOCUMENT -- WE PUT

00:58:19.662 --> 00:58:20.797
FORWARD A PLAN HOW TO GET THE

00:58:20.864 --> 00:58:21.664
SECOND RENTS THE DOCUMENT

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.666
BECAUSE MY KEY GOAL WAS.

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:26.903
NOT HAVING THOSE THREE POINT

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:27.537
FOUR MILLION PEOPLE COME BACK TO

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:27.837
THE OFFICE.

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:29.973
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:31.741
EITHER ONLINE OR BY MAIL.

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:32.942
THE OFFICE OF HOMELAND THE

00:58:33.009 --> 00:58:33.910
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.311
APPROVE THAT PLAN.

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:37.180
WE ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:58:37.247 --> 00:58:38.915
WE UNDERSTOOD THE TIMELINE IN

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:40.250
WHICH TO GO AHEAD AND CLICK THE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:42.118
SECOND RUNS A DOCUMENT -- IN

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.686
THEIR LETTER BACK TO US --

00:58:43.753 --> 00:58:45.622
BASICALLY WE HAVE TO PASS THEY

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:47.457
CAN COME IN ANY TIME NOW IF THEY

00:58:47.523 --> 00:58:49.425
WANT TO GO AHEAD AND ADD THEIR

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.561
SECOND RAZZIE DOCUMENT. TO THE

00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:52.362
REAL IDEA WILL REFLECT OUR

00:58:52.428 --> 00:58:55.164
RECORDS OR AT THEIR SUBSEQUENT

00:58:55.231 --> 00:58:56.132
RENEWAL.

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.367
THEY CAN COME IN WITH THEIR

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.102
SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT.

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:00.403
SO OUR CONCERN WAS THAT WE

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.271
DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY ARE IN

00:59:01.337 --> 00:59:02.939
REQUIRES TO DO THAT ALSO BY

00:59:03.006 --> 00:59:04.941
OCTOBER ONE TWENTY TWENTY TO

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:06.209
COLLECT ALL THE SECOND RESIDENCY

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:07.710
DOCUMENTS THEIR LETTER TO A SAYS.

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:08.845
THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE

00:59:08.912 --> 00:59:10.380
REQUIREMENTS SO CAN HAPPEN OVER

00:59:10.446 --> 00:59:11.614
THE COURSE OF TIME UNTIL THEY

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:13.650
RENEW THEIR ON THEIR CURRENT

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:16.185
LICENSE -- AND THEN WE BASICALLY

00:59:16.252 --> 00:59:17.453
HAVE BEEN GOING FOR WITH THE

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.721
SECOND RESIDENT DOCU WE

00:59:18.788 --> 00:59:20.623
BASICALLY DID A SOFT LAUNCH MANY

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.358
OF OUR FOLKS OF APPLIED FOR REAL

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:24.127

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.195
WITH TO RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS -- I

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:27.497
THINK ARE I BELIEVE OUR WEBSITE

00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:29.299
ALSO REFERS THEM TO BRING TO

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.100
RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS SO WE HAVE

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:32.402
ONLY A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:33.703
PROBABLY SINCE JANUARY THAT HAVE

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:34.904
NOT BROUGHT INTO RESIDENCY

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.805
DOCUMENTS.

00:59:35.872 --> 00:59:37.774
BUT OFFICIALLY GOING APRIL GOING

00:59:39.876 --> 00:59:41.210

RESIDENCY DOCUMENTS TO GO HEAD

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:44.347
SECURE THEIR REAL ID THAT'S THE

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.882

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:49.725
THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE WITH REAL

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.460
ID IS THE FACT THAT IT'S ALSO

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:53.062
NOT MANDATORY IT'S VOLUNTARY

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.130
COMPLIANCE.

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:56.832
AND WHILE WE CAN FORECAST THE

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:58.334
ONGOING ANNUAL RENEWAL OF

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.936
DRIVERS LICENSE AND IDEAS THAT

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:02.104
COME UP WE CAN FORECAST THAT A

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.139
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THOSE

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.307
PEOPLE I THINK ARE FORECAST IS

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.375
ABOUT 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE WILL

01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:09.745
OPT. FOR HAVE A REAL ID --

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:10.846
WHETHER AS A DRIVER'S LICENSE OR

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.815
AN ID CARD BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A

01:04:12.882 --> 01:04:14.750
PASSPORT OR SOME OTHER APPROVED

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:16.319
DOCUMENT PASSPORT WITH A

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:17.753
DRIVER'S LICENSE WILL ALLOW YOU

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.089
TO BOARD A PLANE -- THE

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.757
UNCERTAIN TODAY IS REALLY HOW

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.326
MANY PEOPLE ARE GOING TO NEED

01:04:23.392 --> 01:04:25.628
REAL ID AND WANT REALITY AND

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:27.730
THAT'S THE UNKNOWN PIECES HOW

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:30.166
MANY PEOPLE IN ADVANCE OF THEIR

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:31.801
REGULAR RENEWAL CYCLE.

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:32.969
WILL WANT TO COME INTO THE

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.437
OFFICE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO OPT

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:37.707
IN TO GET REAL ID BEFORE THEIR

01:04:37.773 --> 01:04:38.574
RENEWAL IS DUE.

01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:39.442
THAT'S A BIT OF A GUESSING GAME

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:40.910
WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:42.345
AND LOOKING AT THE TAKE OPERATE.

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.779
THAT THEY'RE SEEING AGAIN HOW

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:45.314
CAN WE SHARE BEST PRACTICES WHAT

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.949
ARE WE LEARNING DO WE NEED TO

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.217
ACTUALLY FORECAST AT A LITTLE

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:50.486
BIT HIGHER. TO YOUR POINT I WISH

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.821
I HAD A CRYSTAL BALL HAD MORE

01:04:51.887 --> 01:04:53.756
CERTAINTY WITH EXACTLY THE

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:54.890
VOLUME WE ARE.

01:04:54.957 --> 01:04:56.559
GIVING OUR BEST ESTIMATE ON WHAT

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:57.827
WE THINK IS GOING TO BE THE TAKE

01:04:57.893 --> 01:04:59.528
OPERATE NOT ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:01.063
HAVE RENEWALS BUT PEOPLE WHO

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.365
MAYBE WILL COME IN ADVANCE OF

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:03.566
THEIR RENEWAL.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:05.001
BUT COMPLIANCE IS REALLY FROM AN

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:07.003
INDIVIDUAL STANDPOINT WE WILL BE

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.704
A COMPLIANCE BECAUSE WE FIND WE

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:09.905
HAVE A PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.407
COME AND GET REAL ID IF THEY

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.475
WANT A REAL ID.

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.943
THEY CAN COME IN AND GET IT THE

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:15.144
QUESTION IS WHEN THEY SHOW UP IN

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.480
AN AIRPORT AND THEY WANT TO FLY.

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:18.581
DO THEY HAVE ALL THE REQUIRED

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.683
DOCUMENTATION AS A CALIFORNIA TO

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.185
DO THAT. ONE FINAL QUESTION IN

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.987
THIS AREA.

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.322
HAD HAVE YOU HAD ASSURANCES THAT

01:05:26.389 --> 01:05:30.559
THE THAT THE REAL ID FORMAT WHAT

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:33.062
IT LOOKS LIKE AND IT PHYSICAL

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.497
WHEN YOU HAVE IT.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:36.399
IS THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:38.267
EXPECTATIONS OF THE FEDERAL

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:42.471
GOVERNMENT YES THAT IS -- ONE

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:43.939
OTHER POINT HERE WITH RESPECT TO

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.174
CUSTOMER WAIT TIMES AND ONE OF

01:05:45.241 --> 01:05:47.209
THE THINGS THAT.

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:50.146
TROUBLED ME ABOUT THE WHAT IT.

01:05:50.212 --> 01:05:55.318
WAS THE AT THE APPARENT -- LACK

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:57.853
OF CANDOR AND FRANKLY I'M I'M

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.089
NOT.

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:01.257
I'M NOT I DON'T WANNA SAY

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:01.557
[inaudible]

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.827
THE THE WASN'T TELLING THE TRUTH

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.662
BUT IT SURE FELT LIKE IT WHEN IT

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.798
COMES TO TRACKING THE TIME A

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:10.833
CUSTOMER WAITS IN LINE BEFORE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.368
THEY ARE CHECKED IN.

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:13.836
AND SO IF YOU GO ON THE WEBSITE

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:15.304
THE WEBSITE REPRESENTS A CERTAIN

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.873
WEIGHT TIME.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.709
AND THE AUDIT DETERMINED.

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:20.910
I THINK THAT THAT WAS NOT

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:25.014
ACCURATE -- I ASKED FORMER

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:26.949
DIRECTOR SHE MOTOR ABOUT THIS

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:28.884
THE LAST TIME SHE WAS HERE.

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:30.419
AND SHE WAS SHE INSISTED THAT

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:31.921
THE DMV WAS WORKING ON WAYS TO

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:34.090
TRACK THE COMPLETE DIRECTION.

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:37.259
THE DURATION OF WAIT TIMES.

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:38.928
AND AS OF THE AUDIT THE

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:41.030
CONCLUSION WAS THAT THE AUDIT

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:42.498
MENTIONS THAT THIS AS WELL.

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.100
OF THAT THIS THIS.

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:47.737
PRE Q. ISSUE -- SO BASICALLY --

ICKET.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.143
SEEMS LIKE THE WHAT THE DMV IS

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.578
DONNA SAID THAT'S THE WAIT TIME

01:06:55.644 --> 01:06:57.413
WHEN YOU TAKE THE TICKET.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.849
NOBODY SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND OR

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.051
WANT TO REPORT.

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.686
THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA END UP

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.287
SITTING IN IN IN A WAIT TIME IN

01:07:05.354 --> 01:07:07.490
IN A LINE THAT IS MUCH LONGER

01:07:07.556 --> 01:07:09.024
THAN THE TIME IT TAKES YOU TO

01:07:09.091 --> 01:07:11.026
GET THE TICKET.

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:14.330

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.644
I MUST TELL YOU THAT.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.313
MOST PEOPLE WHO CONTACT US ABOUT

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:34.550
THE DMB AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OVER

01:07:34.617 --> 01:07:35.518
THIS.

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:39.622
THESE LAST THREE YEARS -- THEY

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.624
TAKE IT THE TRUST FACTOR IN THE

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:44.260
BELIEVABILITY OF THE DMB IS IS

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:45.628
JUST THAT SHREDDED.

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:48.264
AND PART OF IT IS THAT.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:50.232
YOU CAN'T TRUST.

01:07:50.299 --> 01:07:52.401

01:07:52.468 --> 01:07:54.069
TO BE ACTUAL PEOPLE SAY WELL YOU

01:07:54.136 --> 01:07:55.771

SACRAMENTO AND THAT IT WILL BE

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:17.526
AN APPROPRIATE CALCULATION FROM

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.428
THE TIME THAT THEY GET IN THE

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.563
FRONT DOOR.

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:22.131

WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT METHODOLOGY

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.014
TO ENSURE ACCURACY I THINK YOUR

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.454
POSSIBLY EVEN A BIT.

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.323
DECEIVING.

01:10:27.389 --> 01:10:29.458
IT'S NOT ACCURATE.

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:30.793
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING ON

01:10:30.859 --> 01:10:32.661
THE WEBSITE PAGE THAT SAYS THIS

01:10:32.728 --> 01:10:34.096
IS AN ESTIMATE YOU MAY?

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:35.731
END UP WAITING -- YOU KNOW A LOT

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:36.966
LONGER DO YOU DO THAT.

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:40.336
PRESENTLY DO YOU WARN THEM.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.037
THAT THIS IS A GAS.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.672
IT COULD BE WORSE.

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:47.810
IT OUT OF IF YOU IF YOU SHOW UP

01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:48.711

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.546
FOLKS WE UNDERSTAND AND WE'RE

01:10:50.613 --> 01:10:51.947
TRYING TO DO OUR BEST.

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:53.082
BUT WHEN YOU TELL THEM ONE THING

01:10:53.148 --> 01:10:53.682
AND THEN THEIR EXPERIENCE IS

01:10:53.749 --> 01:10:55.217
SOMETHING ELSE AND YOU DON'T

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:56.885
GIVE THEM THE KIND OF WARNING

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:58.921
THAT EVERY RETAILER EVERY.

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.756

I'VE BEEN A TEAM MADE.

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.431
I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF A GOOD

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:24.867
SOLDIER -- ATTITUDE THAT THEY

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.435
THEY JUST PRESUME THERE IS WHEN

01:13:26.502 --> 01:13:28.036
THEY'RE ASKED TO DO THINGS THEY

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:30.672
DO IT BUT WHAT IT DOES ALSO IS --

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:32.641
BECAUSE A RE PRIVATIZATION OF

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.710
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE -- I

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.145

A NORMAL ACTIVITY.

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.987
BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE ABSORBING

01:13:45.053 --> 01:13:46.755
COSTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY.

01:13:46.822 --> 01:13:48.323
NOT FACTORED INTO YOUR BUDGET

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.391

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:05.674
LAST EIGHT YEARS THAT --

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:07.743
REQUIRED DMV TO ACTUALLY

IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS AND MORE

01:14:09.344 --> 01:14:12.414

PROGRAMMING CHANGES WITHIN ARE

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:15.384
VERY FRAGILE TECHNOLOGY

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:16.318
ENVIRONMENT.

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.154
TWENTY BILLS.

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.522
THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:23.025
LEGISLATURE REQUIRING THE DMV TO

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.360

THE LAST TWO MONTHS -- ONE OF

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:36.071
THE THINGS THAT I AM INSTITUTING

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.639
RIGHT NOW AT DMV BECAUSE IT'S

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.907
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.709
MOTOR VOTER RIGHT.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:42.444
AND I HAVE TO STAFF IT CORRECTLY --

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:44.112
IT'S BEEN TREATED BASICALLY AS A

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.147
PROJECT.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:46.481
AND WHAT I MOVING FOR THIS

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.382
ESTABLISHING A GOVERNANCE

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.151
STRUCTURE AND THEN I'M INSURING

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:50.752
THAT I GET THE DATA.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.354
THE DOCUMENTS THE F. T. E.'S

01:14:52.421 --> 01:14:53.889
REQUIRED TO RUN A MOTOR VOTER

01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:56.358
PROGRAM AND IN THE MANNER WHICH

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:57.893

01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.828
AT DMV WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:00.929
OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.731

01:15:12.007 --> 01:15:14.576
PROCESS REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR DMV.

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:15.944
TO HANDLE MOTOR VOTER AND I

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.546
DON'T KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN

HERE IS THAT LEVEL OF

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.551
ASSESSMENT. TO REALLY TAKE A

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.886

IT WE'VE HAD. ONE STATE THAT

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:31.472
ACTUALLY FILE -- FILE THEIR OWN

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.774
LEGISLATION TO NOT ACTUALLY

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:35.443
COMPLY -- WE'VE HAD OTHER STATES

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:36.778
THAT FRANKLY HAVE ONLY JUST

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:39.847
STARTED TO ROLL OUT REAL ID SO

01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:41.949
YOU KNOW ARE ALL OUT TWENTY

01:28:42.016 --> 01:28:42.984
SEVENTEEN IN SOME CASES IS WAY

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:43.985
AHEAD OF THE CURVE OF MANY

01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:46.220
STATES WHO -- ARE STILL ALL

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:48.222
ADDRESSING THIS -- BUT PART OF

01:28:48.289 --> 01:28:49.123
IT WAS.

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.358
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND

01:28:50.425 --> 01:28:52.060
SECURITY ALSO BEING SURE OF WHAT

01:28:52.126 --> 01:28:53.761
IMPLEMENTATION LOOKLIKE WORKING

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:55.396
THROUGH THE NUANCES OF WHAT

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.699
IMPLEMENTATION IS WHAT WOULD BE

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:59.734
THE STANDARD OF ACCEPTANCE AND

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:00.968
THEN INDIVIDUALLY EVERY STATE

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.437
FIGURE OUT HOW.

01:29:02.503 --> 01:29:03.871
TO HOW TO MANAGE IT HINDSIGHT'S

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:05.373
ALWAYS TWENTY TWENTY I CAN LOOK

01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.008
BACK AND SAY YEAH WE COULD HAVE

01:29:07.075 --> 01:29:08.042
PROBABLY DONE A BETTER JOB OF

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.078
PLANNING YES WE COULD HAVE DONE

01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:12.780
A BETTER JOB AROUND GOVERNANCE --

01:29:12.847 --> 01:29:14.382
BUT I WOULD ALSO TELL YOU IT IT

01:29:14.449 --> 01:29:16.150
GOES BACK TO AGAIN WHAT I SHARED

01:29:16.217 --> 01:29:18.553
WITH YOU EARLIER WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:19.187
HUNDRED TWENTY BILLS COMING OUT

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.855
YOU WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING AND

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.923
YOU'VE GOT TO DO PROGRAMMING A

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:23.458
REAL ID.

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:24.859
BUT THEN YOU GET BILLS THAT HAVE

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.561
SENSITIVITY AROUND TIMELINES FOR

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.596
IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE HAVING TO

01:29:28.663 --> 01:29:29.630
RE PRIORITIZE.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:32.333
AND SO I MOVING STAFF AROUND

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.001
FROM OUR PROGRAMMING STANDPOINT

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:35.136
TO ADDRESS THE THINGS OF A

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.738
COMING IN LEGISLATIVELY.

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:37.705
AND THEN REMEMBER ON THE HEELS

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.707
OF ALL THE REAL IDEA ACTIVITY

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.576
WAS IMPLEMENTING MOTOR VOTER --

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.345
AND SO WE HAD A LOT ON OUR PLATE

01:29:44.412 --> 01:29:45.646
IN AND OUT IT'S NOT PREFER

01:29:45.713 --> 01:29:47.648
PERFECT I CAN'T DEFEND IT YES IT

01:29:47.715 --> 01:29:48.750
WAS A WELL PLANNED.

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.251
BUT WE SIT HERE TODAY BUT I

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.120
THINK WE REALLY HAVE A SOLID

01:29:52.186 --> 01:29:53.621
PLAN GOING FORWARD AND THEN OUR

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.189
HOPE IS THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT

01:29:55.256 --> 01:30:00.194
WE REALLY WANT TO BE COMPLIANT --

01:30:00.261 --> 01:30:00.928
I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THROWING

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:01.696
PEOPLE AT SOLUTIONS BUT PEOPLE

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:02.263
AT THE SOLUTIONS TO GET US

01:30:02.330 --> 01:30:03.531
THROUGH.

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.031
TWENTY TWENTY IS REALLY

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:05.967
IMPORTANT UNTIL WE IT -- REALLY

01:30:06.033 --> 01:30:08.136
CREE ALTER OF METHODS IN GREAT

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:09.203
THE DMV OF THE TWENTY FIRST

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.937
CENTURY.

01:30:10.004 --> 01:30:11.272
AND I THINK THE SUMMER IT AS YOU

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:12.406
POINTED THAT OUT THAT'S GOING TO

01:30:12.473 --> 01:30:13.541
TAKE TIME.

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:14.742
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN ONE

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.545
OR TWO YEARS -- BUT WE DO HAVE

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:20.148
TO MEET REAL ID AND I AGREE WITH --

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:22.350
THAT WHICH WAS RACES TWENTY

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:22.984
TWENTY ONE COULD ALSO BE A BIG

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.154
YEAR FOR US WHEN PEOPLE REALIZE

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:26.988
THEY WANT A REAL ID.

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:29.357
SO THE THE HEADLINE TODAY'S

01:30:29.423 --> 01:30:30.591
THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS MIGHT

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:32.460
HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DMV AFTER

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:34.028
ID FAILURE.

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.029
I THINK YOU SAID THE REAL

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.364
NUMBERS PROBABLY THREE POINT

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:37.765
FOUR MILLION ARE THESE REAL

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:39.634
IDEAS THAT WERE ISSUE THERE AND

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.134
SUBSEQUENTLY DEEMED NON

01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:41.102
COMPLIANT.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.737
WHAT WHAT COMPRISES AT THREE

01:30:42.804 --> 01:30:44.205
POINT FOUR MILLION?

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.373
SO THE ROOM THREE PORT THREE

01:30:45.439 --> 01:30:47.241
POINT FOUR MILLION WHO RECEIVE

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.510
THEIR REAL ID ARE COMPLIANT AT

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.978
THIS POINT IN TIME.

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:52.680
IF THEY DON'T COME IN DURING THE

01:30:52.747 --> 01:30:54.115
RENEWAL PERIOD AND WILL HAVE TO

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.116
WORK OUT WE'RE STILL IN

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.717
CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT THAT LOOKS

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:59.387
LIKE -- IF OF THAT THREE POINT

01:30:59.453 --> 01:31:00.888
FOUR MILLION THEY DO NOT PROVIDE

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.623
US A SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.959
THE POINT IN TIME THAT THEY ARE

01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:05.526
UP FOR RENEWAL.

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.228
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.129
THAT LOOKS LIKE SO WHAT STEPS

01:31:08.196 --> 01:31:09.664
ARE YOU ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:11.666
TAKE OR ARE TAKING. TO NOTIFY

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.768
OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT NEED TO

01:31:13.835 --> 01:31:14.669
PROVIDE A SECOND RESIDENCY

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:15.937
DOCUMENT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING

01:31:16.003 --> 01:31:17.438
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO SO

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:20.575
WE HAVE -- MAILERS GOING OUT --

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:21.409
TO ALL THOSE FOLKS THAT HAVE

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:23.678
ACTUALLY -- PART OF THE THREE

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:24.278
POINT FOUR MILLION WE HAVE A

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.079
LETTER.

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:26.247
OUR HOPE IS THAT THE LETTER

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:28.316
ITSELF WILL ACTUALLY SERVE AS A

01:31:28.382 --> 01:31:29.917
FORM SECOND RESIDENCY DOCUMENT.

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:31.586
THEY CAN COMPLETE THAT LETTER IN

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:32.987
THE FORM THAT'S WITH THAT AND

01:31:33.054 --> 01:31:34.522
THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAIL IT BACK

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:36.757
TO US THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO IT IN

01:31:36.824 --> 01:31:37.959
A SEND UP PUT IN A DROP BOX AT A

01:31:38.025 --> 01:31:39.393
DMV OFFICE.

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.695
I THINK THE OTHER PROCESS WE'RE

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.597
LOOKING AT IS THE INTERNET -- IS

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.931
HAVING THE CAPABILITY TO PROCESS

01:31:43.998 --> 01:31:45.166
ON THE INTERNET WILL THEY BE

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.702
ABLE TO SCAN IT INTO A PDF AND

01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:50.137
UP UPLOAD IT TO SOMETHING ONLINE

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:50.838
WE'VE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT

01:31:50.905 --> 01:31:52.206
DOING THAT AS WELL AND THAT'S

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:53.641
AND THAT'S CERTAINLY.

01:31:53.708 --> 01:31:56.377
A PROCESS I THINK FOR US -- WHEN

01:31:56.444 --> 01:31:57.044
WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE SCANNING OF

01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:57.645
IT?

01:31:57.712 --> 01:31:58.746
I'M IS THAT WOULD REQUIRE

01:31:58.813 --> 01:32:01.215
SOMEBODY AT THE DMV OFFICE AND

01:32:01.282 --> 01:32:03.017
TO STAFF APPROPRIATELY TO GO

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:04.118
AHEAD AND HANDLE THE SCANNING

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.987
COMING AND AND THEN THE MAKING

01:32:06.053 --> 01:32:07.154
SURE IT WAS THE RIGHT DOCUMENT

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.723
THAT WAS BEING SCANNED SO.

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.157
I THINK AT THIS POINT -- WE WERE

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:11.492
LOOKING AT WORK LOW DEMAND

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.094
ASSOCIATE WITH ALSO ADDRESSING

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.062
THE SECOND RUNS A DOCUMENT WE

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:16.464
FELT THAT THE THE THREE

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:19.267
APPROACHES WE GAVE A WOULD ALLOW

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:26.807
US TO MANAGE THAT FROM WORKLOAD

01:32:26.874 --> 01:32:27.608
FOR SURE THE ACCURACY OF IT AND

01:32:27.675 --> 01:32:28.843
BILL SAYS FIRE SECOND RESIDENCY

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:29.343
DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS.

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:30.645
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT YOU'RE

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:31.212
GONNA GIVE PEOPLE A VARIETY

01:32:31.279 --> 01:32:32.246
OPTIONS TO FULFILL THAT

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:32.713
REQUIREMENT.

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.547
THAT DO NOT REQUIRE THEM

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:34.749
ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY GOING TO THE

01:32:34.815 --> 01:32:35.716
DMV AROUND POINT IS THAT CORRECT

01:32:35.783 --> 01:32:36.317
CORRECT AND SO THE ONES THAT

01:32:36.384 --> 01:32:37.285
WOULD BE LEFT WOULD BE THE FOLKS

01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:37.885
THAT DON'T OPEN THEIR MAIL OR

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:38.486
THEY DON'T GET THEIR MAIL OR

01:32:38.552 --> 01:32:39.220
THEY GET.

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:41.555
REALLY BUSY THAT MONTH -- OR

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:42.857
SOMETHING LIKE THAT RIGHT RIGHT

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:45.459
AND AND WE ALSO HAVE TALK ABOUT --

01:32:45.526 --> 01:32:46.193
AND PUTTING INTO PLACE FOLLOW

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.029
UPS BECAUSE WE WE REALLY DON'T

01:32:48.095 --> 01:32:49.130
WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO IF HEY

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:50.798
WANTED TO BE COMPLIANT WE DON'T

01:32:50.865 --> 01:32:52.366
WANT THEM TO NOT BE COMPLIANT

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:54.535
WELL AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

01:32:54.602 --> 01:33:00.508
THE NONE OF US WANT TO HAVE

01:33:00.574 --> 01:33:00.942
CONSTITUENTS THAT.

01:33:01.008 --> 01:33:02.143
HAVE A FLIGHT TO GO SEE THEIR

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.710
ILL FAMILY MEMBER AROUND THE

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:03.945
HOLIDAYS WHEN THIS THING FINALLY

01:33:04.011 --> 01:33:05.279
TAKES A FACT AND THEY TRY TO GET

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:10.718
ON AN AIRPLANE THEY'RE TOLD THEY

01:33:10.785 --> 01:33:11.319
HAVE NOT COMPLAINED ID RIGHT.

01:33:11.385 --> 01:33:12.987
I MEAN NONE OF US TO DEAL WITH

01:33:13.054 --> 01:33:13.688
THAT.

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:16.490
RIGHT IRATE CONSTITUENT.

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:17.358
AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT AN

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.759
ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE

01:33:18.826 --> 01:33:19.894
FOR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY IF

01:33:19.961 --> 01:33:20.561
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT DEGREES SO

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.495
I I JUST ENCOURAGE YOU PLEASE

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:21.796

01:33:21.862 --> 01:33:23.364
I GET I GET THE YOU'VE GOT A

01:33:23.431 --> 01:33:23.998
BUNCH OF MANDATES AND YOU'VE GOT

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:25.533
A LOT OF BALLS IN THE AIR AS IT

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:26.167
WERE AND I ICE WHAT I'M HEARING

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.101

AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE THAT

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:33.207
SERVE PERMEATING A LOT OF THESE

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:34.075
ISSUES OLD.

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:35.109
YEAH LET'S FIX THAT I MEAN LET'S

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:36.877
FIX IT AND NOT THROW MONEY AT

01:33:36.944 --> 01:33:38.379
MORE STAFF WE CAN SOLVE THE

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.413
PROBLEM WITH.

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:46.754
WITH TECHNOLOGY HEY WE IT'S TWO

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:47.355
THOUSAND NINETEEN I MEAN I YOU

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:47.989
KNOW I I RUN MY BUSINESS WITH A

01:33:48.055 --> 01:33:48.689
VIRTUALLY PAPERLESS IF IF

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:49.957
NECESSARY MINUTE YOU CAN UPLOAD

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:51.425
THINGS AND SCANNED THINGS IN

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:52.493
FACT THINGS BUT THERE'S JUST SO

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.328
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:54.929
OF THE MALE GENERALLY WORKS I

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.564
MEAN THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.865
WAYS THAT.

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:58.666
THE THAT IT.

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:00.534
AND A GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN USE

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:02.837
TECHNOLOGY TO NOT REQUIRE PEOPLE

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:04.405
THEY HAVE TO BURN THEIR TIME TO

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.673
GO AND PHYSICALLY STAND

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.344
SOMEWHERE IN A AND IN A LONG

TO CLEAR A BACKLOG IT'S ANOTHER

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:01.749
TO PROCESS.

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:04.118
THE CURRENT INPUT.

BACKLOG IS GONE.

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:33.214
BUT WHEN WE ASK FOR

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.915
CLARIFICATION WE REALLY DON'T

ONE NUMBER TWO WE SORT OF GOT AN

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:44.525
ANSWER WHETHER WAS ONLY FIVE

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.125
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SOME

01:37:45.192 --> 01:37:46.427

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:47.094
WELL.

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.230
THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE WELL

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:49.763
THAT'S JUST A SMALL LITTLE

01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:50.965
AMOUNT.

01:37:51.031 --> 01:37:52.499
BUT THOSE PERMIT HOLDERS THEY

01:37:52.566 --> 01:37:53.901
MAY HAVE A HUNDRED TRUCKS.

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:55.302
THEY MAKE AND IN THE CASE THAT I

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:56.937

EIGHT HUNDRED TRUCKS STATEWIDE

01:38:00.074 --> 01:38:02.610

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:03.711
WE'RE GETTING THAT THIS IS A

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:05.779
SIGNIFICANT AND SERIOUS.

01:38:05.846 --> 01:38:08.315

WITHIN REACH AS A DMB IMPROVES

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.713

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:53.153
ESPECIALLY FOR AN ORGANIZATION

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:56.690
IS AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS DMV

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:58.025
NOT TO MENTION.

01:44:58.091 --> 01:45:00.894

A SERIES OF ACTIONS THAT I

01:45:05.298 --> 01:45:06.600
BELIEVE WILL BRING NEW WAYS OF

01:45:06.667 --> 01:45:07.467
OPERATING.

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:10.203

BECAUSE WHAT I AM HEARING AS WE

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:22.768

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.269
MYRIAD CONCERNS.

02:07:24.336 --> 02:07:25.204
THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.705
VERY OFTEN INSTITUTIONALLY WHEN

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:28.240

RELATIVELY NOTHING IN AND IT

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:32.745
TAKES A VERY LONG TIME TO DO

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:33.379

[inaudible]

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:29.661
THAT.

02:09:29.728 --> 02:09:30.095
WE DIDN'T TRUST THE

02:09:30.162 --> 02:09:32.331
IMPLEMENTATION.

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:34.967
WITHIN TRUST THAT THE RESOURCES

02:09:35.033 --> 02:09:38.971
WOULD GET TO THE FIELD -- THE

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:40.873
DMV STAFF WHO WORK HERE BECAUSE

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:41.907
SOME MORE SOMEWHERE HERE IN

02:09:41.974 --> 02:09:43.642
AUGUST CAN ATTEST. TO THE

02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:45.544
CONSISTENCY OF THE QUESTIONS

02:09:45.611 --> 02:09:47.412
THAT WE HAD.

02:09:47.479 --> 02:09:47.946
IN THE CONSISTENCY OF THE

02:09:48.013 --> 02:09:48.914
ANSWERS.

02:09:48.981 --> 02:09:50.849
ON BEHALF THE DM B. B. HERE'S

02:09:50.916 --> 02:09:52.084
WHAT WAS INCONSISTENT.

02:09:52.151 --> 02:09:56.255
WAS WHAT ACTUALLY GOT PUT INTO

02:09:56.321 --> 02:09:58.790
ACTION.

02:09:58.857 --> 02:09:59.892
SO.

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.360
RATE RELATIVE TO OTHER

02:10:01.426 --> 02:10:03.529
DEPARTMENTS SO YOUR AUDITING --

02:10:03.595 --> 02:10:05.464
WHERE IS THIS WAS HIS FAULT A

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:08.267
FAIRLY -- CONSISTENT WITH OTHER

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:11.937
DEFICIENCIES OR IS THIS -- YOU

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:12.571
KNOW.

02:10:12.638 --> 02:10:13.605
WE WITH THIS WITH THIS CALL IN A

02:10:13.672 --> 02:10:15.841
FIVE ON A SCALE OF ONE TO FIVE

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.543
WITH FIVE BEING -- SORT OF THE

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:20.579
MOST -- MOST CONCERNING WITH --

02:10:20.646 --> 02:10:21.980
ONE KIND OF BEING -- SORT OF

02:10:22.047 --> 02:10:23.382
JUST A MINOR CONCERN WHAT WE'RE

02:10:23.448 --> 02:10:25.350
WE'RE THIS FALL AND ALL THE

02:10:25.417 --> 02:10:27.352
DIFFERENT ARTISTS THAT YOU DO.

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.153
IN THE STATE.

02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:28.820
THAT WOULD BE A DIFFICULT

02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:30.556
QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE LIKE

02:10:30.622 --> 02:10:32.758
WE SHARED AT THE BEGINNING OUR

02:10:32.824 --> 02:10:34.826
OBJECTIVES WERE VERY NARROW FOR

02:10:34.893 --> 02:10:36.595
DMV AND EVERY TIME WE GO INTO A

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:38.263
DIFFERENT STATE IS AGENCY WE'RE

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.331
LOOKING AT DIFFERENT THINGS

02:10:39.398 --> 02:10:41.233
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES -- BUT TO

02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.768
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THERE WAS

02:10:42.834 --> 02:10:44.970
SOME LEADERSHIP THAT YOU KNOW

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:46.638
THAT I THINK THE UNDERLYING

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:47.873
MESSAGE OF THE REPORTERS THERE

02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:49.241
WERE SOME LEADERSHIP FAILURES

02:10:49.308 --> 02:10:52.444
AND SO -- I THINK THAT IT IS

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:53.812
DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY WELL IS

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:54.746
THERE LEADERSHIP BETTER THAN

02:10:54.813 --> 02:10:56.715
SOMEONE ELSE'S LEADERSHIP IT WAS

02:10:56.782 --> 02:10:58.383
AT THE TIME WHEN WE ENTERED AND

02:10:58.450 --> 02:11:00.385
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE PROCESSES

02:11:00.452 --> 02:11:01.220
AND PROCEDURES THAT THEY HAD IN

02:11:01.286 --> 02:11:03.522
PLACE.

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:04.089
THAT THEIR COME AND PREVENTS

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:05.557
COULD AND MAKE.

02:11:05.624 --> 02:11:08.026
SO SO GIVEN THAT -- THE

02:11:08.093 --> 02:11:09.561
SITUATION.

02:11:09.628 --> 02:11:12.531
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT

02:11:12.598 --> 02:11:14.166
IMPLEMENTATION OCCURS FROM?

02:11:14.233 --> 02:11:16.101
TOP TO BOTTOM WE WE HAVE AN

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:17.636
ACTING DIRECTOR THE CAME FOR

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.204
SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR TWO MONTHS.

02:11:19.271 --> 02:11:22.541
ON HOW HOW DO WE ENSURE.

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:25.844
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION.

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:26.878
AGAIN A DIFFICULT QUESTION

02:11:26.945 --> 02:11:28.447
BECAUSE GENERALLY THE AUDITOR'S

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:30.215
GO OUT THEY PROVIDE A REPORT

02:11:30.282 --> 02:11:32.351
THEY CITE WHAT THEY SEE BUT IT

02:11:32.417 --> 02:11:33.919
IS AT THE DEPARTMENTS DISCRETION

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.053
TO IMPLEMENT OUR UP

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:37.256
RECOMMENDATIONS.

02:11:37.322 --> 02:11:39.992
SO -- AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY KIND

02:11:40.058 --> 02:11:41.393
OF TEETH TO SAY NO FULLER DIDN'T

02:11:41.460 --> 02:11:44.229
YOU DIDN'T DO IT RIGHT BUT WE DO.

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:47.232
YES SO I GET THAT SO I GUESS THE

02:11:47.299 --> 02:11:49.735
THE THE QUESTION IS IS -- AT

02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:51.069
THIS POINT THERE'S A COMPLETE

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:53.138
LACK OF CONFIDENCE ACROSS THE

02:11:53.205 --> 02:11:53.972
BOARD.

02:11:54.039 --> 02:11:57.776
IN THE DEPARTMENT'S ABILITY.

02:11:57.843 --> 02:11:59.077
TO DO WHAT THEY SAY.

02:11:59.144 --> 02:12:01.013
SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT CAN

02:12:01.079 --> 02:12:02.114
ACTUALLY HELP.

02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:03.548
WELL DONE IF I MAY.

02:12:03.615 --> 02:12:05.617
MISTER CHAIRMAN GOVERNOR NEWSOME

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:07.853
IS AB ADDED THAT THAT CHANGE

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.388
WILL HAPPEN AT THE DMV.

02:12:09.454 --> 02:12:11.623
ANY STARTING OFF WITH THE TOP

02:12:11.690 --> 02:12:12.691
THE LEADERSHIP.

02:12:12.758 --> 02:12:14.293
AND AS I SAID RECRUITMENT HAS

02:12:14.359 --> 02:12:17.963
BEGUN -- FOR A NEW DIRECTOR

02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.599
THERE ARE OTHER VCANCIES --

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:21.867
CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND OTHER.

02:12:21.933 --> 02:12:23.802
OTHER VACANCIES IN THE TOP

02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:26.505
LEADERSHIP -- THE GOVERNOR WILL

02:12:26.571 --> 02:12:31.109
ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT MOTIVATED --

02:12:31.176 --> 02:12:33.378
PERSONS PERSONS WILL BE

02:12:33.445 --> 02:12:36.014
APPOINTED AND THEIR THEY WILL BE

02:12:36.081 --> 02:12:38.183
HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR NOT ONLY

02:12:38.250 --> 02:12:39.885
THE THINGS THAT THE STRIKE TEAM.

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:43.088
IS IS -- DEVELOPING BUT ALSO TO

02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:44.623
THE TO AS YOU SAID THIS

02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.124
EXTREMELY THOROUGH AUDIT THAT

02:12:46.191 --> 02:12:47.426
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID.

02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:49.394
SO SO I I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:52.764
WORDS THAT THEY WILL BE HELD

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:54.066
ACCOUNTABLE RIGHT HERE'S WHAT'S

02:12:54.132 --> 02:12:54.333
MISSING.

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:54.933
THEY'LL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.870
WHAT. TWO TWO AND IN MAKING THE

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:00.772
MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE AUDIT

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:03.575
HAS HAS -- IDENTIFIED THINGS

02:13:03.642 --> 02:13:04.976
THAT THE STRIKE FORCE HAS

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:07.446
IDENTIFIED AND HAS ALREADY TAKEN.

02:13:07.512 --> 02:13:10.248
INTO ACCOUNT AND IS WORKING ON%

02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:11.817
HERE BECAUSE A PROBLEM EVEN IN

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.852
YOUR OWN SPEECH I GIVE YOU SOME

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:15.120
LATITUDE BECAUSE IT WAS A LITTLE

02:13:15.187 --> 02:13:16.955
BIT LONG I AM CALLING -- AND

02:13:17.022 --> 02:13:18.457
ALSO TO THE DIRECTOR SPEECH WAS

02:13:18.523 --> 02:13:23.228
EXCESSIVELY LONG THERE WERE --

02:13:23.295 --> 02:13:24.529
THINGS THAT WERE MISSING.

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:25.664
SO THEN WHAT WHAT WAS MISSING

02:13:25.731 --> 02:13:27.065
WAS DATA [inaudible]

02:13:27.132 --> 02:13:30.202
FAX TIMELINE BENCHMARKS

02:13:30.268 --> 02:13:32.637
PERFORMANCE MEASURES SO I DON'T

02:13:32.704 --> 02:13:35.841
HAVE ANYTHING. TO DETERMINE.

02:13:35.907 --> 02:13:37.909
OR TO HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE FOR

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:40.445
THE DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE.

02:13:40.512 --> 02:13:41.313
THERE WAS NO WE'RE GONNA REDUCE

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:43.248
WE TIMES BY THIS MUCH THIS IS

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.082
HOW MANY CUTS WAS WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:45.384
SERVE WE'RE GONNA.

02:13:45.450 --> 02:13:48.086
YOU KNOW IT TOOK. SEVEN MONTHS

02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:50.689
TO ROLL OUT WHY FIGHT TO THE

02:13:50.756 --> 02:13:52.124
EXTERNAL.

02:13:52.190 --> 02:13:54.326
OF ONE D. M. V. FIELD OFFICE.

02:13:54.393 --> 02:13:55.927
HOW MANY FIELD OFFICES ARE

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:58.530
THEY'RE PRETTY IN THE? SEVENTY

02:13:58.597 --> 02:13:59.164
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO SO BASED

02:13:59.231 --> 02:13:59.765
ON THAT PAGE HOW MANY YEARS

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:01.600
WOULD IT TAKE TO ROLL OUT EVERY

02:14:01.666 --> 02:14:04.870
SINGLE ONE I DON'T THINK THAT

02:14:04.936 --> 02:14:07.072
WILL DO THEM SOME SEQUENTIALLY --

02:14:07.139 --> 02:14:09.307
BUT BUT BUT I A WEALTH BUT BUT I

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:10.075
GET THE FEELING.

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:11.042
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THE POINT IS

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:13.812
IN AUGUST WE DISCUSS THIS ISSUE.

02:14:13.879 --> 02:14:15.614
THIS WAS A MAJOR PRIORITY HOW

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.150
LONG ARE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE

02:14:18.216 --> 02:14:20.152
WE ARE ASSURED WE'RE GONNA WE'RE

02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:22.187
GONNA -- WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT

02:14:22.254 --> 02:14:25.624
HOW TO DO THIS BETTER FASTER.

AND OVER THE LAST DECADE PUBLIC

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:50.941
SCHOOLS HAVE HONORED UNDERGONE

02:30:51.008 --> 02:30:52.676
TREMENDOUS STATE MANDATED

02:30:52.743 --> 02:30:55.579
TRANSFORMATION WE'VE GONE ON TO

02:30:55.646 --> 02:30:56.847
A NEW COMMON CORE SET OF

02:30:56.914 --> 02:30:58.616
STANDARDS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

02:30:58.682 --> 02:30:59.950
SMARTER BALANCED ASSESSMENT

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:01.452
TESTING WHICH MEANT THAT EVERY

02:31:01.519 --> 02:31:02.453
STUDENT HAD TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:03.687
PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY IN THEIR

02:31:03.754 --> 02:31:04.722
HAND IN ORDER. TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:31:04.789 --> 02:31:06.323
THOSE ASSESSMENTS IN A VERY

02:31:06.390 --> 02:31:07.458
SHORT TIME WINDOW THAT WAS

02:31:07.525 --> 02:31:10.661
PROVIDED. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:12.463
DISTRICTS ROSE TO THAT CHALLENGE

02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:13.597
IN A DIMINISHED FUNDING

02:31:13.664 --> 02:31:15.332
ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THERE THERE IS

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:16.734
NOT ENOUGH SCHOOL FUNDING TO

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:18.035
REALLY RESOURCE WHAT ALL OF THE

02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:19.136
NEEDS ARE.

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:20.604
AND SO I'M LEFT AT THE END OF

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:22.706
THESE THREE PANELS CONVERSATION

02:31:22.773 --> 02:31:24.408
SAYING IS THE LEADERSHIP CHANGE

02:31:24.475 --> 02:31:25.609
THAT'S NEEDED.

02:31:25.676 --> 02:31:27.978
A DEVOLVING A DMB LEADERSHIP TO

02:31:28.045 --> 02:31:29.313
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:30.648
DOES IT MAKE MORE SENSE AT THIS

02:31:30.714 --> 02:31:31.415
POINT TO SHIFT THIS

02:31:31.482 --> 02:31:32.783
RESPONSIBILITY TO LOCAL

02:31:32.850 --> 02:31:34.051
LEADERSHIP AND INSTITUTIONS

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:34.885
WHERE THERE'S A DIRECT

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.487
RELATIONSHIP TO THE CONSTITUENTS

02:31:36.554 --> 02:31:38.189
BEING SERVED AND THEREFORE A

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:40.157
REAL TIME NEED TO ACTUALLY MAKE

02:31:40.224 --> 02:31:41.559
THESE CHANGES HAPPEN.

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:43.260
BECAUSE I AM I JUST BEING HERE

02:31:43.327 --> 02:31:44.428
IN FEW HOURS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE

02:31:44.495 --> 02:31:45.329
TODAY IN THE FEW MONTHS THAT

02:31:45.396 --> 02:31:46.997
I'VE BEEN IN THE CAPITAL THE DMV

02:31:47.064 --> 02:31:48.866
IS MY SINGLE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION

02:31:48.933 --> 02:31:50.601
AND I'M A PROBLEM SOLVER.

02:31:50.668 --> 02:31:52.303
AND I'M STILL NOT HEARING A

02:31:52.369 --> 02:31:54.038
COUPLE OF HOURS IN HOW WE'RE

02:31:54.104 --> 02:31:56.540
GOING TO SOLVE THIS I HEAR A RE

02:31:56.607 --> 02:31:58.042
FRAMING OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE

02:31:58.108 --> 02:32:00.010
BUT I AM NOT HEARING A ROAD MAP

02:32:00.077 --> 02:32:01.345
FOR HOW WE FIX IT.

02:32:01.412 --> 02:32:02.546
AND IN MANY CASES WHEN YOU'RE

02:32:02.613 --> 02:32:04.281
TALKING ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT

02:32:04.348 --> 02:32:06.083
SERVICE THE BEST.

02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:08.052
MODEL TO PROVIDE THAT.

02:32:08.118 --> 02:32:10.421
IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO SHARE TO

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:13.390
ME YOUR CONCEPT OF WHAT THE NEW.

02:32:13.457 --> 02:32:15.192
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE

02:32:15.259 --> 02:32:16.494
BECAUSE I WANT SOME MEASURE OF

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.995
ACCOUNTABILITY IN MY DISTRICT

02:32:18.062 --> 02:32:21.899
THAT I CAN GO TO DIRECTLY NOW TO

02:32:21.966 --> 02:32:25.369
GET THESE QUESTIONS ANSWERED --

02:32:25.436 --> 02:32:26.337
YOUR READERS THAT FROM NOW ON

02:32:26.403 --> 02:32:27.538
YOU MAY HAVE SOME THOUGHTS YOU

02:32:27.605 --> 02:32:28.439
WANT TO SHARE.

02:32:28.506 --> 02:32:29.106
I'M.

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:29.640
SO.

02:32:29.707 --> 02:32:31.075
GREAT QUESTION IN ONE OF THESE I

02:32:31.141 --> 02:32:33.110
WILL TELL YOU THAT -- IF YOU'RE

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:34.512
FAMILIAR WITH IT I AM A BIG

02:32:34.578 --> 02:32:35.746
ADVOCATE OF WHAT THEY CALL THE

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:36.981
BALANCED SCORECARD IT SOUNDS

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:38.849
LIKE THE SCHOOLS WERE ACTUALLY

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:39.416
IMPLEMENTING SOMETHING ALONG

02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:41.685
THOSE LINES -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK

02:32:41.752 --> 02:32:44.054
AT ANY ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TO

02:32:44.121 --> 02:32:45.556
LOOK AT WHO ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS

02:32:45.623 --> 02:32:46.524
ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS FOR

02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:47.825
SERVING YOUR CUSTOMERS AND ONE

02:32:47.892 --> 02:32:48.893
OF THE METRICS YOU NEED TO BE

02:32:48.959 --> 02:32:49.727
PUTTING IN PLACE.

02:32:49.793 --> 02:32:51.095
AND THEN YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:53.097
STRUCTURE TO ENSURE YOU HAVE

02:32:53.163 --> 02:32:55.699
WHAT I CALL HORIZONTAL --

02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:56.967
ENTERPRISE FOCUS OF HOW RICH

02:32:57.034 --> 02:32:58.536
EVEN BECAUSE ONE IS I FIND

02:32:58.602 --> 02:32:59.937
INTERESTING AND GOVERNMENT.

02:33:00.004 --> 02:33:05.242
IS THE PROGRAMS GET GOING BUT

02:33:05.309 --> 02:33:06.744
THERE IS SOMETIMES AND THEY

02:33:06.810 --> 02:33:07.378
DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:33:07.444 --> 02:33:08.012
ON IT ON THE SAME TEAM TOGETHER

02:33:08.078 --> 02:33:08.646
A PART OF WHAT I NEED TO DO IS

02:33:08.712 --> 02:33:10.114
AT DMV IS MAKE SURE THERE'S A

02:33:10.180 --> 02:33:12.216
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING.

02:33:12.283 --> 02:33:13.417
OF OUR MISSION OUR VISION OUR

02:33:13.484 --> 02:33:15.085
CUSTOMERS THE GOALS WERE ALL

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:16.754
TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE ROLE THAT

02:33:16.820 --> 02:33:18.856
EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ALIGNED WITH

02:33:18.923 --> 02:33:20.691
THE WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY.

02:33:20.758 --> 02:33:21.559
HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:23.260
RESPONSIBILITY -- FACILITIES MAN

02:33:23.327 --> 02:33:24.461
FOR SOUNDS LIKE HOW DO THOSE

02:33:24.528 --> 02:33:25.829
GOALS ALIGNED WITH ACTUALLY

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:27.064
DELIVERING SERVICE TO OUR

02:33:27.131 --> 02:33:28.265
CUSTOMERS.

02:33:28.332 --> 02:33:29.833
BUT IT ALL STARTS WITH A STRONG

02:33:29.900 --> 02:33:31.268
ENTERPRISE GOVERNANCE TEAM AND

02:33:31.335 --> 02:33:32.870
SO THAT WOULD BE THE EXECUTIVES

02:33:32.937 --> 02:33:34.672
THE DEPUTIES ALL LINED AND

02:33:34.738 --> 02:33:36.240
MEASURING AND HOLDING EACH OTHER

02:33:36.307 --> 02:33:37.274
ACCOUNTABLE.

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:38.108
BECAUSE I ALSO THINK IT'S

02:33:38.175 --> 02:33:39.677
HOLDING EACH OTHER ACCOUNTABLE

02:33:39.743 --> 02:33:41.312
TO ACHIEVING THE GOALS BUT I

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:42.746
THINK EVEN MOST IMPORTANTLY

02:33:42.813 --> 02:33:44.048
YOU'VE ALL STRESSES AND I I

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.749

AS WE DO NEED TO PUT OUT A

02:33:48.652 --> 02:33:50.354
PERFORMANCE MANAGER REPORT NOW I

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:51.121
I KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING

02:33:51.188 --> 02:33:53.591
OUT A REPORT ON A MONTHLY BASIS --

02:33:53.657 --> 02:33:55.593
THAT TALKS ABOUT THE INITIAL

02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:57.161
WAIT TIMES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

02:33:57.227 --> 02:33:58.429
I WOULD OFFER AND I'VE TALKED TO

02:33:58.495 --> 02:33:59.697
SOME OF THE BUDGET STAFF THAT WE

02:33:59.763 --> 02:34:01.732

AND THAT WE AGREED TO ONE OF THE

02:34:05.069 --> 02:34:06.971
KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WE

02:34:07.037 --> 02:34:08.806
NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON TO ADDRESS

02:34:08.872 --> 02:34:10.674
THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES.

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:12.276
BUT ALSO ASSURE YOU GOOD

02:34:12.343 --> 02:34:13.877
STEWARDSHIP OF THE FUNDS THAT

02:34:20.851 --> 02:34:22.853
AND I THINK YOU HAVE A FAIR FAIR

02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:24.888
REQUEST TO EXPECT US TO REPORT

02:34:24.955 --> 02:34:27.891

02:34:27.958 --> 02:34:29.460
WHAT I WILL TELL YOU IT'S A

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:30.794
CULTURE THAT'S EXISTED FOR A

02:34:33.931 --> 02:34:36.233
SO WHAT I DO AND WHAT WE GO IN

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:37.635
WITH THE GOV UP STRIKE TEAM

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:38.869
ISN'T GOING TO JUST TURN IT

CERTAIN AREAS OF DMV THE I. T.

02:35:52.009 --> 02:35:53.444
AREA IN PARTICULAR.

HAVE STATED.

02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:12.429
AS WELL AS THE RIGHT STRUCTURE

02:36:12.496 --> 02:36:14.164
THAT INDEED DOES TAKE INTO

02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:16.100
CONSIDERATION THOSE FIELD

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:17.434
OFFICES ARE CRITICAL THEY ARE.

02:36:17.501 --> 02:36:18.836
SMALL LITTLE CITIES AND TO

02:36:18.902 --> 02:36:20.404
THEMSELVES DO THEY HAVE THE

02:36:20.471 --> 02:36:22.072
RIGHT STRUCTURE AS I THINK

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:24.274
ACTING DIRECTOR WEB SAID EARLIER.

02:36:24.341 --> 02:36:26.243
ALL OF THE FIELD OFFICES ARE

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:27.277
EXTREMELY DIFFERENT AND WHEN

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:28.245
THEY'VE BEEN BUILT I MEAN THE

02:36:28.312 --> 02:36:30.280
PHIL OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO IS

02:36:30.347 --> 02:36:31.482
EXTREMELY DIFFERENT THEN THE

02:36:31.548 --> 02:36:32.516
DALY CITY.

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:34.618
THEN -- AND THOSE THAT ARE IT

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:36.787
MORE MODERNIZED AND THEY THEY

02:36:36.854 --> 02:36:39.456
LACK TRAINING ROOMS THEY HAVEN'T

02:36:39.523 --> 02:36:41.091
BEEN STUDIED IN TERMS OF THE

02:36:41.158 --> 02:36:43.961
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE THROUGH THEM --

02:36:44.027 --> 02:36:44.995
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

02:36:45.062 --> 02:36:45.929
WE'VE.

02:36:45.996 --> 02:36:48.098
BEEN WORKING WITH MACKENZIE ON

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:50.634
IS HOW DO YOU AND OPERATE WITHIN

02:36:50.701 --> 02:36:52.202
THE SPACE WHEN THE SPACE IS VERY

02:36:52.269 --> 02:36:54.171
DIFFERENT YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THE

02:36:54.238 --> 02:36:55.572
THE PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE IF

02:36:55.639 --> 02:36:57.508
THEY HAVE -- CHAIRS THERE FOR

02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:58.809
THEM THEY'RE LITERALLY SITTING

02:36:58.876 --> 02:37:00.677
THERE LOOKING AT AT THE

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.379
FUNCTIONING OF DMV THE

02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:06.984
INEFFICIENCIES BEFORE THEM

02:37:07.050 --> 02:37:07.951
WINDOWS OPEN IN SO FOURTH WE

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:08.519
REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT HOW

02:37:08.585 --> 02:37:09.052
PEOPLE FLOW THROUGH THESE

02:37:09.119 --> 02:37:10.254
OFFICES.

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:13.557
AND ON COME UP WITH A MUCH

02:37:13.624 --> 02:37:15.993
BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT PLAN --

02:37:16.059 --> 02:37:17.361
FOR FOR ALL OF THE DMV'S IF YOU

02:37:17.427 --> 02:37:19.663
WILL BUT LOCAL -- CONTROL IS

02:37:19.730 --> 02:37:22.132
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND LOCAL

02:37:22.199 --> 02:37:27.204
OUR CONCERN IS NATION'S GETTING

02:37:27.271 --> 02:37:28.739
THE PROPER TRAINING.

02:37:28.806 --> 02:37:30.808
DO WE HAVE THE PROPER AND

02:37:30.874 --> 02:37:33.343
STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF HAVE THE

02:37:33.410 --> 02:37:35.546
REGION'S ALLOCATED PROPERLY ARE

02:37:35.612 --> 02:37:37.181
THEY AS THE AUDIT DONE WELL

02:37:37.247 --> 02:37:39.449

02:37:39.516 --> 02:37:41.385
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY THROUGH THE

02:37:41.451 --> 02:37:43.253
THROUGH THAT AND TO THAT -- I

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.888
THINK THE AUDIT POINTED OUT WELL

02:37:44.955 --> 02:37:48.091
THAT THE THE REGIONS AND THE DM

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:49.726
B. FIELD OFFICES HAVE BEEN

02:37:49.793 --> 02:37:51.895

NINETY WE ADVANCE GREATLY IN HOW

02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:55.332
WE PERFORMED WORK.

02:37:55.399 --> 02:37:56.867
HAVE THOSE PROCESSES THAT THEY

02:37:56.934 --> 02:37:58.735
PERFORMED IN LIKE THAT AND THOSE

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:01.638
ARE THINGS WE HAVE TO HAVE DONE

02:38:01.705 --> 02:38:03.841
NOW.

02:38:03.907 --> 02:38:06.043
THE SPEECH IN OURS.

02:38:06.109 --> 02:38:07.611
I THINK WHEN SO ONE RECURRING

02:38:07.678 --> 02:38:08.879
THEME IN OUR CONVERSATION HAS

02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:11.815
BEEN I THINK SOME CONCERN ABOUT.

02:38:11.882 --> 02:38:14.518
A LACK OF A CLEAR READ MATH AND

02:38:14.585 --> 02:38:16.353
A LACK OF SEEMING LACK OF CLEAR

02:38:16.420 --> 02:38:17.621

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:14.845
LEAST TO THE THE ONE OF THE

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:17.180
AREAS AS AN EXAMPLE THE KIOSKS

02:39:17.247 --> 02:39:18.749
I'VE MET WITH THE VENDOR THE I.

02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:21.652
T. I. -- AND ASKED THEM NOT ONLY

02:39:21.718 --> 02:39:22.953
FOR A COMMUNICATIONS PLAN WHICH

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:24.321
THEY HAVE PUT TOGETHER BUT FOR A

02:39:24.388 --> 02:39:26.023
REVIEW OF THEIR METHODOLOGY WHAT

02:39:26.089 --> 02:39:27.891
HOW DO THEY DECIDE WHERE KIOSKS

02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:28.692
GO.

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:30.994
AND REVIEW OF THEIR MEDIA AT

02:39:31.061 --> 02:39:32.763
METHODOLOGIES AND A PLAN AS TO

02:39:32.829 --> 02:39:34.398
WHERE THEY WOULD PUT THE HUNDRED

02:39:34.464 --> 02:39:35.532
THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR AS WELL AS

02:39:35.599 --> 02:39:37.167
A PLUS.

02:39:37.234 --> 02:39:37.801
ONE HUNDRED THAT WE HOPE TO HAVE

02:39:37.868 --> 02:39:39.503
OUT IN THE FIELD -- BY THE END

02:39:39.569 --> 02:39:41.605
IS THE END OF THE YEAR AND I

02:39:41.672 --> 02:39:43.240
UNDERSTAND COLEEN THAT THEY ARE

02:39:43.307 --> 02:39:44.741
PUTTING THAT TOGETHER.

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:47.044
SO -- THAT IS AT AT A PLAN FOR

02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:48.912
THE KIOSKS BOTH A RECHECK OF

02:39:48.979 --> 02:39:50.847
THEIR METHODOLOGY WHERE BEST TO

02:39:50.914 --> 02:39:52.616
WE PLACES CARIASO A REVIEW OF

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:53.650
WHETHERTHEY'RE APPROPRIATE

02:39:53.717 --> 02:39:54.384
STILL THAT.

02:39:54.451 --> 02:39:56.053
HAVE MORE IN THE IN THE DMV

02:39:56.119 --> 02:39:57.988
OFFICES WHICH DRIVE TRAFFIC INTO

02:39:58.055 --> 02:39:59.489
THE FIELD OFFICE WHICH IS AGAIN

02:39:59.556 --> 02:40:00.857
NOT ONE OF OUR GOALS.

02:40:00.924 --> 02:40:05.462
SO THAT IS ONE OF THE PLANS

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:08.598
AROUND ON AROUND THE KIOSKS ERA.

02:40:08.665 --> 02:40:09.833

DELIVERABLES FOR EACH OF THOSE

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:20.143

TO GETTING PEOPLE COMFORTABLE

VERY HIGH TECH SILICON VALLEY

02:41:34.684 --> 02:41:35.786
WHERE YOU CAN GO IN THERE IT'S

FANTASTIC JOB.

02:41:57.140 --> 02:41:58.608

FROM THE OTHER STATES AS WELL SO

02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:24.514
WELL ON WITHTHE PROPOSAL THAT

02:45:24.581 --> 02:45:25.982
WE HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:45:26.049 --> 02:45:27.717
AND THE APPROPRIATION THAT WERE

02:45:27.784 --> 02:45:30.053
ASKING FOR SOME OF THE THINGS IN

02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:32.555
TERMS OF THE MODERNIZATION AND

02:45:32.622 --> 02:45:33.923
THINGS THAT WE CAN DO.

02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:35.825

02:45:35.892 --> 02:45:39.195
RESOURCES WE HAVE -- IN TERMS OF

02:45:39.262 --> 02:45:41.431
OF DMB OF THE FUTURE THAT'S

02:45:41.498 --> 02:45:43.166
SOMETHING HOPEFULLY THAT WE HAVE

02:45:43.233 --> 02:45:46.002
ABSOLUTELY OPPORTUNITIES -- TO

02:45:46.069 --> 02:45:48.872
WITH NEW RELEASES COMING DO WITH --

02:45:48.938 --> 02:45:51.174
SOME LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED

02:45:51.241 --> 02:45:52.442
SEVERAL YEARS AGO THAT ALLOWS --

02:45:52.509 --> 02:45:55.445
DMV'S TO ACTUALLY CONSIDER I'M

02:46:00.250 --> 02:46:01.217
IN THE LEGISLATION RANCHO

02:46:01.284 --> 02:46:02.552
CUCAMONGA.

AND SAN DIEGO AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:46:07.457 --> 02:46:09.993
AGAIN -- IN A PLAN THAT WOULD

02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:12.762
COULD BE IMPLEMENTED LITERALLY

02:46:12.829 --> 02:46:14.531
IN THE IN THE NEXT YEAR.

02:46:14.597 --> 02:46:16.533
THERE ARE MANY MORE TIME FRAMES

02:46:16.599 --> 02:46:18.268
THAT WEEK WEEK THE MOST

02:46:18.335 --> 02:46:19.836
IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK WE

02:46:19.903 --> 02:46:21.638
NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT A

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:22.172
VERY IMPORTANT.

02:46:22.238 --> 02:46:23.206
ROAD MAP.

02:46:23.273 --> 02:46:25.008
IS WHAT WILL BE DUE AT THE END

02:46:25.075 --> 02:46:27.243
OF MAY AND THAT IS A ROADMAP TO

02:46:27.310 --> 02:46:28.712
IMPLEMENT THE AUDIT.

02:46:28.778 --> 02:46:31.314
AND THAT WILL HAVE MATRIX THAT

02:46:31.381 --> 02:46:33.450
WILL HAVE -- TIME FRAMES

02:46:33.516 --> 02:46:36.820
BENCHMARKS -- AND THAT WILL BE

02:46:36.886 --> 02:46:39.255
DUE AND THE ACTING DIRECTOR WILL

02:46:39.322 --> 02:46:40.790
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S DONE IN A

02:46:40.857 --> 02:46:41.524
TIMELY WAY.

02:46:41.591 --> 02:46:43.159
IT WOULDN'T AND THAT PLAN THOUGH

02:46:43.226 --> 02:46:46.062
IS IS PHASED OVERLAID WITH A

02:46:46.129 --> 02:46:47.230
LONG TERM VISION RIGHT I MEAN

02:46:47.297 --> 02:46:49.232

APPRECIATE THIS EXAMPLE WHERE

02:46:51.634 --> 02:46:52.902
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NOTHING

02:46:52.969 --> 02:46:54.704
FRUSTRATES MIKE INCISIONS MORE

02:46:54.771 --> 02:46:56.639
WHEN THEY WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING

02:46:56.706 --> 02:47:00.009
TO BUILD A ROAD AND AND SO.

02:47:00.076 --> 02:47:01.745
THEY THEY BUILD A SIDEWALK.

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:02.645
AND THEY SPENT HUNDREDS OF

02:47:02.712 --> 02:47:03.213
THOUSAND DOLLARS A BILL THE

02:47:03.279 --> 02:47:03.780
SIDEWALK AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:47:03.847 --> 02:47:04.748
THEY FIX THE ROADS THE TERROR OF

02:47:04.814 --> 02:47:05.882
THE ROAD EDITOR OF THE SIDEWALK

02:47:05.949 --> 02:47:07.117
IT IS BUILT IN AND THEN REBUILD

02:47:07.183 --> 02:47:08.551
THE WHOLE THING ALL OVER AGAIN.

02:47:08.618 --> 02:47:10.920
SO ARE WE YOU KNOW WE GONNA.

02:47:10.987 --> 02:47:13.123
PUT OTHERS -- INVESTMENT INTO

02:47:13.189 --> 02:47:14.724
THESE INTO THESE ALL THESE

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:16.760

BROKEN MORTAR STUFF AND ALL OF A

02:47:18.361 --> 02:47:19.863
SUDDEN IN FIVE YEARS YOUR VISION

02:47:19.929 --> 02:47:20.764
IS NOT TO HAVE BROKEN WATER

02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:21.331

GOING TO BE IN THE BUILDINGS

02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:30.940
THAT WE USE AND THEN ALL OF A

02:47:31.007 --> 02:47:31.841
SUDDEN.

02:47:31.908 --> 02:47:32.642
IT'S NOT YET YOU IS A MAKES AS

02:47:32.709 --> 02:47:34.377

AND WE ARE IN INDIA THERE'S

02:47:36.112 --> 02:47:36.446
SYNERGY.

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:38.515
WE'RE THEY THESE ARE EXAMPLES

02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:41.451
CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT GOING. TO TO

02:47:41.518 --> 02:47:43.787
REINVENT EVERY DMV OFFICE IN THE

02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:46.122
NEXT YEAR OR TWO AND AND AND TEN

02:47:46.189 --> 02:47:46.990
YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WE HAVE A

02:47:47.056 --> 02:47:48.425
THOMAS VEHICLES AND WE HAVE

02:47:48.491 --> 02:47:49.526
FEWER.

02:47:49.592 --> 02:47:52.829
PEOPLE DRIVING -- AND AND MAYBE

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:54.764
WE ARE REALLY TURNING THE DMV IN

02:47:54.831 --> 02:47:56.232
TWENTY YEARS INTO AN IDEA

02:47:56.299 --> 02:47:58.735
AUTHENTICATION -- SHOP AND NOT

02:47:58.802 --> 02:48:00.136
NOT SOMETHING THAT DEALS WITH

02:48:00.203 --> 02:48:01.971
THE VEHICLES I MEAN THAT THOSE

02:48:02.038 --> 02:48:03.106
ARE THINGS WORK.

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:05.041
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH HERE AND

02:48:05.108 --> 02:48:07.076
AND CERTAINLY NOT CONTEMPLATING

02:48:07.143 --> 02:48:09.212
IN TERMS OF THE IMMEDIATE PLANS

02:48:09.279 --> 02:48:11.014
BUT WE WOULD NEVER WANT.

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:12.449
TO YOUR EXAMPLE OF TEARING UP

02:48:12.515 --> 02:48:13.416
THE SPENDING MONEY AND TEARING

02:48:13.483 --> 02:48:16.219
SOMETHING UP ONLY -- TO WASTE

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.788
THE TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS OBVIOUSLY

02:48:18.855 --> 02:48:19.956
NINE APPRECIATE THAT AND I I

02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:20.657
THINK THAT MY VERGE OF

02:48:20.723 --> 02:48:21.524
QUESTIONING AYE I THINK IT'S A

02:48:21.591 --> 02:48:23.660
MEMBER SMITH IS IS CORRECT MAYBE.

02:48:23.726 --> 02:48:24.928
THERE IS NEW WHAT THE NEWTON

02:48:24.994 --> 02:48:27.430
LOCALIZED -- APPROACHES AND THEN

02:48:27.497 --> 02:48:28.498
AND THEN T&lt;c.cyan&gt; GET INTO WHAT&lt;/c&gt;

02:48:28.565 --> 02:48:29.966
OTHER STATES ARE DOING -- I

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.401
THINK IT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:32.402
THAT WE LOOK AT OTHER STATES ARE

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:34.337
DOING IT VERY WELL LEARN FROM

02:48:34.404 --> 02:48:35.505
THE STATE'S SAID A FAILED.

02:48:35.572 --> 02:48:36.973
BOB WE WOULD I WOULD I WOULD

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.141
PROBABLY SAY THAT OUR STATE HAS

02:48:38.208 --> 02:48:39.642
STRUGGLED CLEARLY OVER THE

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:41.911
UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE DAY -- IN

02:48:41.978 --> 02:48:44.047

02:48:44.681 --> 02:48:47.984
WHEEL BUT I THINK I SHARE AS AS

02:48:48.051 --> 02:48:49.519
YOU SAID EARLIER I I SHARE SOME

02:48:49.586 --> 02:48:51.721
NUMBER ESTIMATES FRUSTRATION --

02:48:51.788 --> 02:48:53.523
IN THIS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE

02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:54.858
TO BE THIS WAY.

02:48:54.924 --> 02:49:02.232
THANK YOU.

AND AGAIN I THINK ONE OF THE

02:49:11.474 --> 02:49:11.741
THINGS IT IS.

02:49:11.808 --> 02:49:12.942
TROUBLING TO ME IS. FOR LOCAL

WE'D HAVE RESULTS.

02:49:23.753 --> 02:49:25.321

APPREHENSIVE ABOUT.

02:49:38.401 --> 02:49:39.402
THIS AGENCY BECAUSE OF THE

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:41.471
REPUTATION IN THE PAST.

02:49:41.538 --> 02:49:44.107
NOW I DO.

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:48.177
HAVE SOME RENEWED -- EXCITEMENT

02:49:48.244 --> 02:49:50.013

YOU IN THIS PLACE -- LONG

02:49:58.521 --> 02:50:03.192
OVERDUE -- BUT UNITE.

02:50:03.259 --> 02:50:04.594
WE TALKED ABOUT CULTURE

02:50:04.661 --> 02:50:06.663
YESTERDAY ALSO.

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:09.899
BROWN ALL CULTURE -- AND THE

02:50:09.966 --> 02:50:12.735
EXPECTATION OF THE PUBLIC.

02:50:12.802 --> 02:50:14.337
AND I THINK MISTER PATTERSON WAS

02:50:14.404 --> 02:50:16.172
KIND OF SPOT ON WE TALKED ABOUT

02:50:16.239 --> 02:50:19.776
THE THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU KNOW

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:20.443
WHAT.

02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:21.711
WHEN I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:22.779
A TNT?

02:50:22.845 --> 02:50:27.584
THEY TELL ME BETWEEN EIGHT AND

02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:28.217
TWELVE AND THEY USUALLY SHOW UP

02:50:28.284 --> 02:50:32.021
AT TWELVE OKAY SO.

02:50:32.088 --> 02:50:32.922
MAKING.

02:50:32.989 --> 02:50:35.758
A GOOD FAITH EFFORT I THINK IS

02:50:35.825 --> 02:50:37.527
IS AN HONORABLE THING.

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:39.963
REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS HAVE TO

02:50:40.029 --> 02:50:42.565
BE IMPLEMENTED -- BUT WE ALSO

02:50:42.632 --> 02:50:44.968
TALKED ABOUT CROSS TRAINING OF

02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:47.570
STAFF I DON'T WANT AN EMPTY WHEN.

02:50:47.637 --> 02:50:49.138
IF SOMEBODY CALLS IN SICK I WANT

02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:51.040
SOMEBODY TO BE ABLE TO MAN THAT.

02:50:51.107 --> 02:50:52.909
OR WOMAN THAT THAT WINDOW SO

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:55.144
THAT WE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

02:50:55.211 --> 02:50:56.379
TO PROVIDE EVERY TRANSACTION YOU

02:50:56.446 --> 02:51:00.617
TALKED ABOUT MOBILE POP UPS --

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:03.019
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY

02:51:03.086 --> 02:51:03.653
FOR TRANSACTIONS PEOPLE WAITING

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:05.888
LINE WE CLOSED IF YOU ARE I

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:07.890
DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER BUT WE

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:09.459
CLOSE SOME DMV'S.

02:51:09.525 --> 02:51:11.294
A IN THE PAST.

02:51:11.361 --> 02:51:12.929
I DON'T THINK IT WAS A LOT BUT

02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:14.731
THERE WERE THERE WERE.

02:51:14.797 --> 02:51:15.531
WINDOWS THAT.

02:51:15.598 --> 02:51:17.367
WOULD HAVE BEEN CAPACITY.

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:18.868
I WANT TO SEE A BIGGER MOVE

02:51:18.935 --> 02:51:20.937
TOWARDS.

02:51:21.004 --> 02:51:22.238
ACCOMMODATING IN SOME KIND OF

02:51:22.305 --> 02:51:24.807
MODULAR FASHION -- THE RURAL

02:51:24.874 --> 02:51:27.977
AREAS -- WHERE YOU HAVE TARGETED --

02:51:28.044 --> 02:51:29.879
HABITUAL.

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:31.948
EAST AND YOU KNOW PROBLEMS OF

02:51:32.015 --> 02:51:35.418
GETTING PEOPLE SERVICE -- BUT I

02:51:35.485 --> 02:51:37.120
THINK ACCOUNTABILITY TO ME IS IS

02:51:37.186 --> 02:51:39.088
THE BIGGEST FACTOR IS I DON'T

02:51:39.155 --> 02:51:40.823
THINK WE'RE GETTING ENOUGH REAL

02:51:40.890 --> 02:51:43.826
TIME INFORMATION BACK -- ON A

02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:45.395
REGULAR BASIS NOW THE MONTH

02:51:45.461 --> 02:51:46.896
EVERY MONTH NOW HAS BEEN.

02:51:46.963 --> 02:51:48.331
YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A REFRESHING

02:51:48.398 --> 02:51:52.068
THING AND I READ THAT REPORT --

02:51:52.135 --> 02:51:53.836
AND AGAIN I'M TRYING TO HOLD

02:51:53.903 --> 02:51:57.073
BACK BILLS AS YOU ASKED --

02:51:57.140 --> 02:51:58.908
BECAUSE OF THE ONEROUS OF

02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:00.443
FASHION IT WOULD TAKE TO THE

02:52:00.510 --> 02:52:02.745
AGENCY RIGHT NOW -- SO THAT

02:52:02.812 --> 02:52:03.980
YOU'RE NOT IMPOUNDED WITH A

02:52:04.047 --> 02:52:08.685
BUNCH OF OTHER EXPECTATIONS.

02:52:08.751 --> 02:52:11.020
THAT BEING SAID I MEAN.

02:52:11.087 --> 02:52:12.188
YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU YOU'RE

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:14.257
ASKING FOR A LOT OF MONEY TO BE

02:52:14.323 --> 02:52:16.526
ABLE TO FIX THIS.

02:52:16.592 --> 02:52:18.094
AND WE TALKED ABOUT MY

02:52:18.161 --> 02:52:19.829
RESPONSIBILITY NOT ONLY IS THE

02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:22.465
DMV IS THAT AS THE POLICY CHAIR

02:52:22.532 --> 02:52:24.100
BUT I OVERSEE.

02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:26.669
THE HOT HIGHWAY PATROL -- T. S.

02:52:26.736 --> 02:52:29.305
AND CALTRANS IN MY FASHION.

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:30.606
AND I ASKED FOR A HUNDRED

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:32.642
MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR.

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:34.377
FROM THE HIGHWAY PATROL BECAUSE

02:52:34.444 --> 02:52:38.214
WE'RE VERY SHORT IN OFFICERS.

02:52:38.281 --> 02:52:40.183
WERE THOUSAND OFFICERS DOWN.

02:52:40.249 --> 02:52:42.719
WHEN I WAS DENIED IT WAS VETOED?

02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:45.888
AND WORD UP 27% AND DEATHS.

02:52:45.955 --> 02:52:47.023
SO AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE'VE

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:48.891
GOT TO MAKE.

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:53.096
A DECISION ABOUT PRIORITIES.

02:52:53.162 --> 02:52:54.564
I APPRECIATE THAT WE CAN GET AN

02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:56.966
ECONOMY OF SCALE WITH A LOT OF

02:52:57.033 --> 02:52:58.668
EFFICIENCIES ARE PUT IN PLACE.

02:52:58.735 --> 02:53:00.636
BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT ADDITIONAL

02:53:00.703 --> 02:53:02.705
MONEY BECAUSE PROMISE AS HAVE

02:53:02.772 --> 02:53:04.273
NOT BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE.

02:53:04.340 --> 02:53:06.909
MY EXPECTATION IS TO SAVE LIVES.

02:53:06.976 --> 02:53:09.378
AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND IF I

02:53:09.445 --> 02:53:11.047
CAN DO THAT I SAID OFFICER

02:53:11.114 --> 02:53:12.849
KILLED IN RIVERSIDE.

02:53:12.915 --> 02:53:14.984
HEY I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOW IT

02:53:15.051 --> 02:53:15.685
FROZE OFFICERS ON THE ROAD.

02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:16.319
IT'S HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO

02:53:16.385 --> 02:53:17.687
DO THAT SO.

02:53:17.754 --> 02:53:19.522
I THINK WE HAVE AN EXPECTATION.

02:53:19.589 --> 02:53:22.358
OF OF BALANCE.

02:53:22.425 --> 02:53:23.359
BUT YOU KNOW.

02:53:23.426 --> 02:53:25.027
AGAIN.

02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:26.596
SHOW ME THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

02:53:26.662 --> 02:53:28.965
ABLE TO DO IT AND KEEP IT IN

02:53:29.031 --> 02:53:29.599
BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A REVOLVING

02:53:29.665 --> 02:53:31.100
DOOR.

02:53:31.167 --> 02:53:33.803
BUT YOU CAN KEEP IT ROLLING.

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.938
AND THEN I'M MORE APT TO BE.

02:53:36.005 --> 02:53:37.940
LOOKING AT OTHER RESOURCES FOR

02:53:38.007 --> 02:53:40.209
REVENUE FOR YOU.

02:53:40.276 --> 02:53:42.512
OUTSIDE OF THE NBA OR IN YOUR A

02:53:42.578 --> 02:53:44.046

YESTERDAY YOUR CAPACITY TO RAISE

02:53:46.482 --> 02:53:49.318
REVENUE AND OTHER AREAS.

02:53:49.385 --> 02:53:50.520
BUT I HAVE SO MANY OTHER NEEDS.

02:53:50.586 --> 02:53:52.121
IN THE MBA.

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:54.123
THAT I JUST I CAN'T SEE THIS

02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:54.757
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT FOR

02:53:54.824 --> 02:53:55.958

AND AND I APPRECIATE.

02:53:58.895 --> 02:54:00.029
THE WILLINGNESS TO BRING THIS

02:54:00.096 --> 02:54:02.098

PLACE IT.

02:54:07.003 --> 02:54:10.740
I THINK IT CAN BE SUCCESSFUL.

02:54:10.807 --> 02:54:12.375
BUT I'M ALWAYS AFRAID OF THAT

02:54:12.441 --> 02:54:18.681

02:54:42.038 --> 02:54:43.372
WELL.

02:54:43.439 --> 02:54:45.141
FIRST I WILL ASSURE YOU THAT A

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:46.809
DV WE TAKE THE MOTOR VOTER

02:54:46.876 --> 02:54:48.110
RESPONSIBLE IN GETTING IT RIGHT

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:49.779
VERY SERIOUSLY WE ARE COMMITTED

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:50.513
TO IT.

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:52.081
I WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT WE

02:54:52.148 --> 02:54:55.551
HAVE -- BEEN IN CONSTANT

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:56.285
CONVERSATION THE SECRETARY OF

02:54:56.352 --> 02:54:57.954
STATE TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS WE

02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.488
MEET ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

02:54:59.555 --> 02:55:00.857
WITH A SEPARATE STATE TO LOOK AT

02:55:00.923 --> 02:55:02.391
HIM PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE

02:55:02.458 --> 02:55:04.093
SURE WE'RE GETTING RECORDS OVER

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:04.727
TO THEM THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:05.862
HANDLE.

02:55:05.928 --> 02:55:06.629
I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT'S

02:55:06.696 --> 02:55:08.798
GOING TO BE HAPPY -- HELPFUL IS --

02:55:08.865 --> 02:55:11.133
ERNST AND YOUNG AUDIT THAT WAS

02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:11.734
COMMISSIONED BY THE DEPARTMENT

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:13.636
OF FINANCE -- AND SO I'M LOOKING

02:55:13.703 --> 02:55:14.937
FORWARD RECEIVING THAT AUDIT

02:55:15.004 --> 02:55:16.072
THERE ARE STILL IN OUR OFFICE

02:55:16.138 --> 02:55:18.741
RIGHT NOW DOING SOME ASSESSMENTS.

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:20.009
BUT I THINK ALL OF THAT COMING

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:20.943
TOGETHER.

02:55:21.010 --> 02:55:22.378
WILL BE VERY HELPFUL MAKE SOME

02:55:22.445 --> 02:55:24.213
DECISIONS GOING FORWARD I I

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:25.948
ANTICIPATE SOME OF THE FINDINGS

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:27.717
MAY NOT BE DIFFERENT THAN THE

02:55:27.783 --> 02:55:28.851
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AUDIT

02:55:28.918 --> 02:55:29.485
EITHER.

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:31.520
I DO FIRMLY BELIEVE GOVERNANCE

02:55:31.587 --> 02:55:32.889
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE I

02:55:32.955 --> 02:55:34.523
KNOW WE'VE REPEATED THAT ON

02:55:34.590 --> 02:55:35.892
NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.

02:55:35.958 --> 02:55:37.460
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT ANY

02:55:37.526 --> 02:55:39.996
HEALTHY ORGANIZATION AND ANY

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:41.831
PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATION NON

02:55:41.898 --> 02:55:43.332
PROFIT OR EVEN IN THE STATE.

02:55:43.399 --> 02:55:45.334
IT USUALLY STARTS WITH A REALLY

02:55:45.401 --> 02:55:47.703
COOL IT'S STRONG ENTERPRISE

02:55:47.770 --> 02:55:49.071
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AT THE TOP.

02:55:49.138 --> 02:55:50.539
AND IT'S IT DEALS WITH THE

02:55:50.606 --> 02:55:52.475
BREAKING DOWN OF SILENCE DMV IS

02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:53.976
A RICH IN SILOS.

02:55:54.043 --> 02:55:55.411
AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS

02:55:55.478 --> 02:55:59.448
BREAK DOWN THOSE SILOS SO THERE

02:55:59.515 --> 02:56:01.550
THAT ACTIVITY IN EFFORTS THAT

02:56:01.617 --> 02:56:01.751
ARE.

02:56:01.817 --> 02:56:04.520
BEING ADDRESSED -- AND THAT'S A

02:56:04.587 --> 02:56:06.255
CULTURAL CHANGE -- BY THE

02:56:06.322 --> 02:56:07.323
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRESHER AND

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:09.392
ADDRESS THE CULTURE PEAS AND AND

02:56:09.458 --> 02:56:10.826
THE MORALE AND AND AND FOLKS ARE

02:56:10.893 --> 02:56:12.328
FULLY LITTLE BEATEN DOWN AND

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:14.030
TRYING TO DO BUT THE BEST THEY

02:56:14.096 --> 02:56:16.098
CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE --

02:56:16.165 --> 02:56:18.100
AND AND WHAT I NEED TO DO AND

02:56:18.167 --> 02:56:19.702
AND MY KIND OF MY MESSAGE TO

02:56:19.769 --> 02:56:22.104
PEOPLE IS I WANT TO MOVE.

02:56:22.171 --> 02:56:22.872
FROM MAINTAINING OUR

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:24.573
GRANDPARENTS DMV TO CREATING OUR

02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:26.409
CHILDREN STAMPING AND I BECAUSE

02:56:26.475 --> 02:56:27.877
THEY ALL KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

02:56:27.944 --> 02:56:29.211
WOULD NOT LIKE GOING INTO THE

02:56:29.278 --> 02:56:30.746
DMV THAT EXISTS TODAY.

02:56:30.813 --> 02:56:32.214
BUT WE ALL COLLECTIVELY

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:34.016
COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO BE ON THAT

02:56:34.083 --> 02:56:35.685
ROAD TOGETHER AND I REALLY LIKE

02:56:35.751 --> 02:56:37.053
THE IDEA OF KIND OF A VISIONING

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:38.955
SESSION THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

02:56:39.021 --> 02:56:40.523
JUST US BY OURSELVES.

02:56:40.589 --> 02:56:45.294
BUT WHAT DOES THE FUTURE DMV

02:56:45.361 --> 02:56:46.729
LOOK LIKE IN INDIANA CERTAINLY

02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:47.697
IS A MODEL FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK

02:56:47.763 --> 02:56:48.831
AT ON THE MOTOR VOTER AND

02:56:48.898 --> 02:56:51.767
GETTING BACK TO THAT PIECE -- I

02:56:51.834 --> 02:56:52.335
WOULD TELL YOU THERE'S BEEN

02:56:52.401 --> 02:56:54.804
GREAT PROGRESS -- SINCE THE THE

02:56:54.870 --> 02:56:56.005
RESEARCH ASSOCIATE WITH THAT

02:56:56.072 --> 02:56:58.507
ARTICLE -- WE DO HAVE A

02:56:58.574 --> 02:57:00.343
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE IN PLACE --

02:57:00.409 --> 02:57:01.811
ONE THINGS I AM PUTTING TOGETHER

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:02.979
IS A MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM IT'S

02:57:03.045 --> 02:57:04.747
NOT A PROJECT THE TV IT'S A

02:57:04.814 --> 02:57:05.748
PROGRAM.

02:57:05.815 --> 02:57:06.949
AND WE NEED A STAFF AND AS A

02:57:07.016 --> 02:57:07.984
PROGRAMMER APPROPRIATELY IT

02:57:08.050 --> 02:57:09.251
TOUCHES MANY OF OUR PROGRAM

02:57:09.318 --> 02:57:11.821
AREAS AND SO I'M WORKING THROUGH

02:57:11.887 --> 02:57:13.222
ESTABLISHING REALLY THAT

02:57:13.289 --> 02:57:14.824
PERMANENT PROGRAM UNDERSTAND THE

02:57:14.890 --> 02:57:18.427
F. T. EASE THE AND THE P. WISE

02:57:18.494 --> 02:57:19.729
THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO GO

02:57:19.795 --> 02:57:20.930
HEAD SUPPORT THAT PROGRAMMING ON

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:21.530
A GO FORWARD.

02:57:21.597 --> 02:57:23.899
BASIS IT HAS BEEN A RESOURCE

02:57:23.966 --> 02:57:24.767
DEMAND.

02:57:24.834 --> 02:57:26.469
BUT I ALSO SAY THAT WE HAVEN'T

02:57:26.535 --> 02:57:28.471
BEEN AS EFFICIENT AS WE COULD BE

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:29.305
AND HOW HE MANAGE IT SO WE'RE

02:57:29.372 --> 02:57:30.072
ALSO.

02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.273
DOING A LOT OF PROCESS

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:33.743
IMPROVEMENT AND NUMBER THE AREAS

02:57:33.809 --> 02:57:35.978
AROUND A MOTOR VOTER.

02:57:36.045 --> 02:57:37.580
SO DO YOU THINK ANY FURTHER

02:57:37.646 --> 02:57:39.982
INQUIRY.

02:57:40.049 --> 02:57:42.118
WOULD BE WARRANTED KIND OF BASED

02:57:42.184 --> 02:57:44.120
ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THAT

02:57:44.186 --> 02:57:46.322
ARTICLE POINTED TO OR DO YOU

02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.956
FEEL LIKE THAT IS ALREADY UNDER

02:57:47.023 --> 02:57:48.090
WAY.

02:57:48.157 --> 02:57:49.959
I THINK THE ERNST AND YOUNG --

02:57:50.026 --> 02:57:52.128
ASSESSMENT WILL BE REVEALING TO

02:57:52.194 --> 02:57:53.696
WHAT THEY FOUND AND THEN I THINK

02:57:53.763 --> 02:57:55.264
THIS BODY CERTAINLY HAS ABILITY

02:57:55.331 --> 02:57:56.465
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION GOING

02:57:56.532 --> 02:57:59.969
FORWARD OKAY SO PRINCETON YOUNG.

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:03.572
DVD BUT IT [inaudible]

02:58:03.639 --> 02:58:05.808
THIS PAST.

02:58:05.875 --> 02:58:07.343
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS BENEFIT

02:58:07.410 --> 02:58:10.279
DRESSED -- HAS ANYBODY ASKED.

02:58:10.346 --> 02:58:12.782
WHAT IS YOUR VISION FOR THE

02:58:12.848 --> 02:58:14.550
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY DMB?

02:58:14.617 --> 02:58:15.718
IF YOU COULD DO THE ETCH A

02:58:15.785 --> 02:58:17.787
SKETCH TURN THE MISTAKES UPSIDE

02:58:17.853 --> 02:58:18.854
DOWN.

02:58:18.921 --> 02:58:22.825
AND DESIGN THE DMV OF THE FUTURE.

02:58:22.892 --> 02:58:23.692
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT IT

02:58:23.759 --> 02:58:25.728
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:27.463
WELL AND AS YOU AND I THINK

02:58:27.530 --> 02:58:28.531
DISCUSSED YESTERDAY WE TALKED A

02:58:28.597 --> 02:58:30.933
LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT -- SOME

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.436
OF THE IDEAS AROUND -- THE IDEA

02:58:33.502 --> 02:58:34.870
AND AND SKIS WITH THE DMV OF THE

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:38.307
FUTURE ONE BEING A TWENTY FOUR

02:58:38.374 --> 02:58:39.608
SEVEN SELF SERVICE DMV.

02:58:39.675 --> 02:58:42.845
BUT NO LINES AND PEOPLE MOVING

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.947
FREELY WITH THROUGH AN OFFICE IN

02:58:45.014 --> 02:58:47.149
A STREAMLINED MANNER -- WITH

02:58:47.216 --> 02:58:48.851
WITH.

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:50.753
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE -- THEIR

02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:52.922
SERVICE WHERE THEY CAN GO TO GET

02:58:52.988 --> 02:58:54.557
THE SERVICE THEY NEED IN A VERY.

02:58:54.623 --> 02:58:57.827
EASY AND THOUGHTFUL WAY LIKE AN

02:58:57.893 --> 02:59:00.763
APPLE STORE -- FOR INSTANCE A

02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:03.199
PLEASANT ENVIRONMENT AND

02:59:03.265 --> 02:59:05.034
ENVIRONMENT THAT IT'S CLEAN

02:59:05.101 --> 02:59:09.004
EFFICIENT -- ONE THAT SERVES

02:59:09.071 --> 02:59:10.906
EVERYONE THAT IS THERE TO BE

02:59:10.973 --> 02:59:13.742
SERVED IN AN EFFECTIVE WAY AGAIN

02:59:13.809 --> 02:59:15.845
YOU MENTIONED AMAZON TYPE OF

02:59:15.911 --> 02:59:17.346
SERVICES AND WE TALKED ABOUT AN

02:59:17.413 --> 02:59:18.547
APPLE STORE.

02:59:18.614 --> 02:59:20.082
WE'VE TALKEDTO I'VE TALKED TO

02:59:20.149 --> 02:59:21.484
THE ARCHITECTS ACTUALLY THEY

02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:23.619
HAVE DESIGNED THE ORIGINAL

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.154
DESIGNERS OF THE APPLE STORE.

02:59:25.221 --> 02:59:26.722
I'M HOPING THAT THEY CAN BE

02:59:26.789 --> 02:59:28.891
ENGAGED IS AS AS ONE THAT

02:59:28.958 --> 02:59:32.995
PERHAPS ANSWERS THEY ARE IF Q..

02:59:33.062 --> 02:59:34.597
AND SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:59:34.663 --> 02:59:35.564
SOME OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE

02:59:35.631 --> 02:59:36.966
HAD I WISH WE COULD HAVE AN

02:59:37.032 --> 02:59:38.901
ACTION AT TO SKETCH AND START

02:59:38.968 --> 02:59:41.170

SIR EARLIER WELL THAT AND THERE

02:59:44.106 --> 02:59:45.774
ARE THOUSANDS MILLIONS OF

02:59:45.841 --> 02:59:47.943
TRANSACTIONS THAT THE DMV IN ITS

02:59:48.010 --> 02:59:50.146
CURRENT STATE HAVE TO CONTINUE

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:51.881
TO DO EVERY DAY WHILE WE ARE

02:59:51.947 --> 02:59:52.681
LOOKING.

02:59:52.748 --> 02:59:55.651
AND MAKING -- IN REAL TIME

02:59:55.718 --> 02:59:58.354
CHANGES NOW BUT STILL LOOKING

02:59:58.420 --> 02:59:59.788
FORWARD TO MAKING MORE CHANGES

02:59:59.855 --> 03:00:01.824
WE'RE STILL DEALING WITH A VERY

03:00:01.891 --> 03:00:04.426
AGED AN UNSTABLE INFRASTRUCTURE

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:05.995
IN THEIR I. T. WE'RE DEALING

03:00:06.061 --> 03:00:07.229
WITH.

03:00:07.296 --> 03:00:09.498
AND UNDER RESOURCE AND AND

03:00:09.565 --> 03:00:11.033
RESOURCE TECHNICIANS IN THE CALL

03:00:11.100 --> 03:00:14.670
CENTERS AND INDEED EVEN AT THE

03:00:14.737 --> 03:00:14.904
WINDOWS.

THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO

03:00:17.973 --> 03:00:19.842
CONTEND WITH AND DEAL WITH NOW

03:00:19.909 --> 03:00:21.410
WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING

03:00:21.477 --> 03:00:23.379
THAT DMV OF THE FUTURE MUCH MORE

03:00:23.445 --> 03:00:24.513
EFFECTIVE.

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:25.748
DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS AFTER NOT

03:00:25.814 --> 03:00:27.750

WE'RE DOING -- WITH RESPECT TO

03:00:29.885 --> 03:00:31.921
THIS BUILDING.

03:00:31.987 --> 03:00:33.856
RIGHT WE HAVE TO OPERATE IN IT

03:00:33.923 --> 03:00:34.990
AND SO WE'RE BUILDING SOMETHING

03:00:35.057 --> 03:00:35.291
OVER THERE.

03:00:35.357 --> 03:00:37.159
WE'RE GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY

03:00:37.226 --> 03:00:38.661
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER THERE.

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:39.962
YEAH AND THEN.

03:00:40.029 --> 03:00:41.697
THIS GETS FIXED I MEAN THE BIG

03:00:41.764 --> 03:00:43.399
CHALLENGER TO ME IN THE AND

03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:44.733

BRING IT DOWN.

03:00:52.508 --> 03:00:53.709
AND THEN TURN AROUND AND BRING

03:00:53.776 --> 03:00:55.544
UP THE NEW.

03:00:55.611 --> 03:00:56.545
ONE WE WERE DOING THAT WITH THIS

03:00:56.612 --> 03:00:58.214
BUILDING  CAN YOU DO IT WITH

ASPIRATIONAL APPROACH THAT

YOU'VE TAKEN ON AND I THINK I

IN ESSENCE MORE PEOPLE COULD BE

YOUR DATA IS NOT RIPE.

03:04:20.716 --> 03:04:22.317
SO THE THE WAIT TIME DATA THAT'S

03:04:22.384 --> 03:04:24.253
IN THE MONTH REPORTS THAT WE

03:04:24.319 --> 03:04:26.955

03:04:42.404 --> 03:04:45.707
THERE'S NOBODY THERE -- DOES

03:04:45.774 --> 03:04:49.044

03:04:54.216 --> 03:04:55.784
SO WE ARE.

03:04:55.851 --> 03:04:58.687

WHAT WE DO HAVE IS.

03:05:11.800 --> 03:05:14.169
WE HAVE A CLEAR EVALUATION OF

03:05:14.236 --> 03:05:16.872

THAT APPROPRIATION.

03:06:16.131 --> 03:06:17.366
WAS NOT APPROVED.

03:06:17.432 --> 03:06:18.700
BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF

03:06:18.767 --> 03:06:19.835
FAITH.

03:06:19.902 --> 03:06:24.673

03:07:49.691 --> 03:07:50.792
THE OTHER POINT JUST TO GO BACK

03:07:50.859 --> 03:07:52.394

THEY DON'T HAVE A HUGE UPTAKE

03:08:30.866 --> 03:08:32.067
IT'S A MATTER MAKING SURE THE

03:08:32.134 --> 03:08:33.135
COMMUNITY IS AWARE AND SO THAT'S

03:08:33.201 --> 03:08:34.736

GOING ON FOR TOO LONG.

03:15:23.878 --> 03:15:26.981
SO THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.

03:15:27.048 --> 03:15:28.483
THIS IS THIS IS NOT ANY

TABLETS WERE WERE UTILIZED

03:16:36.284 --> 03:16:38.887
TABLETS WERE DEPLOYED OUT TO A

03:16:38.953 --> 03:16:39.787

I THINK OF THAT RELATE TO IT THE

03:16:45.126 --> 03:16:46.928
CONSISTENCY CHALLENGE AND SOME

03:16:46.995 --> 03:16:47.962
OF THE TABLETS MAY HAVE BEEN

03:16:48.029 --> 03:16:49.564

03:17:04.012 --> 03:17:04.312
TELLING YOU DO.

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:05.480

03:17:05.547 --> 03:17:07.182
WE DO HAVE A WAY AND SO WE HAVE

03:17:07.248 --> 03:17:08.883
A MECHANISM OR WE CAN TRACK THE

03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:09.918
LAST TIME THAT THE TABLET WAS.

03:17:09.984 --> 03:17:10.885

THERE ARE HOW MANY IN TOTAL --

03:17:26.868 --> 03:17:28.336
FIVE HUNDRED YEAH I THOUGHT

03:17:28.403 --> 03:17:28.903

ABOUT SEVENTY OFFICES I I THINK

03:17:38.446 --> 03:17:38.980
OF ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE

03:17:39.047 --> 03:17:40.582

WAITING FOR THE OTHER TO CHARGE

03:17:42.717 --> 03:17:43.952
SO I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:17:44.018 --> 03:17:46.054
KNOW IN A SMALLER OFFICE.

03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:47.922

GOD.

03:28:51.318 --> 03:28:53.220
GENTLEMAN FROM DMV IT'S IT'S NOT

03:28:53.287 --> 03:28:54.188
A MATTER OF MORE DETAIL THAN

03:28:54.255 --> 03:28:55.389
THIS IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT

03:28:55.456 --> 03:28:56.323
THAN THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

03:28:56.390 --> 03:28:58.592

TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE I

THE SHORT TERM BUT I PERSONALLY

03:29:18.979 --> 03:29:19.980
THINK WE HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE

03:29:20.047 --> 03:29:23.150
AMBITIOUS THAN IT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

03:29:23.217 --> 03:29:24.551
WE DON'T HAVE FIVE YEARS TO

03:29:24.618 --> 03:29:26.487
REBUILD THIS PLATFORM IS WHAT IT

03:29:26.553 --> 03:29:28.289
SOUNDS LIKE TO ME AND THE NUMBER

03:29:28.355 --> 03:29:29.523

03:29:43.604 --> 03:29:44.838
JUST MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO

03:29:44.905 --> 03:29:45.940
UNDERLYING ISSUES THERE THAT

03:29:46.006 --> 03:29:48.108

WE HAVE A BUDGET REQUEST AT THIS

03:30:04.358 --> 03:30:05.626
POINT IS LACKING [inaudible]

03:30:05.693 --> 03:30:07.594
HOME.

03:30:07.661 --> 03:30:10.364
THIS IS THE COMPLETE DEFINITION

03:30:10.431 --> 03:30:11.565
OF INSANITY AND WANT TO QUOTE

03:30:11.632 --> 03:30:13.801
OUR GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE USED

03:30:13.867 --> 03:30:14.401
THIS QUOTE QUITE OFTEN WHEN HE

03:30:14.468 --> 03:30:15.536
WAS MAYOR.

03:30:15.602 --> 03:30:17.171
THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY AS WE

03:30:17.237 --> 03:30:18.339
ALL KNOW IS DOING THE SAME THING

03:30:18.405 --> 03:30:19.506
OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

03:30:19.573 --> 03:30:22.242
EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT.

03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.810
SO WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THAT

03:30:22.876 --> 03:30:24.611
MISTAKE.

03:30:24.678 --> 03:30:28.048

03:30:53.607 --> 03:30:55.776
TO SERVE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:30:55.843 --> 03:30:56.243

03:30:56.310 --> 03:30:58.612
MANY OF WHOM ARE VERY UPSET

03:30:58.679 --> 03:31:00.981
BECAUSE OF OF HOW LONG THE LINES

03:31:02.483 --> 03:31:05.152
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE CONTROL OF

IN THE FIELD OFFICE.

03:31:40.554 --> 03:31:42.022

IT DOESN'T GET US TO WHERE WE

03:32:35.109 --> 03:32:36.510
