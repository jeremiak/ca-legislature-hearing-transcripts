WITH ALL THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THE WAY LET'S MOVE ON TO THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING. LAST MONTH STATEWIDE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL ELECTION RAISE QUESTIONS. ABOUT WHETHER OUR ONE HUNDRED TEN YEAR OLD RECALL PROCESS WAS THE FIFTH HAS. SUFFICIENT CHECKS AND BALANCES TO ENSURE DEMOCRATIC AND FAIR ELECTIONS. WELL I BELIEVE THE RECALL IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR VOTERS TO ADDRESS MISCONDUCT BY ELECTED OFFICIALS. I AM TROUBLED BY THE FUNDAMENTALLY UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT RECALL PROCESS. AS I'VE PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUSLY STATED CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD NOT ALLOW AN ELECTED OFFICIAL TO BE RECALLED AND REPLACED BY SOMEONE ELSE WHO RECEIVES FAR FEWER VOTES. BUT IF LAST MONTH'S RECALL HAD SUCCEEDED THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. IN FACT GOVERNOR NEWSOM WHO RECEIVED MORE THAN SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION VOTES IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY SOMEONE WHO RECEIVED FEWER THAN THREE POINT SIX MILLION VOTES. IN THE RECALL. IN ADDITION TO THE UNDEMOCRATIC NATURE OF CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT RECALL PROCESS MANY PEOPLE HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT THE HYPER POLARIZATION OF SOCIETY. COUPLED WITH THE ABNORMALLY LOW THRESHOLD TO QUALIFY RECALL. CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL MINORITIES OF CALIFORNIANS TO WEAPONIZE THE RECALL PROCESS TO DISRUPT GOVERNMENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE RECALL PROCESS IN MOST OTHER STATES. AND WHAT SMALL IMPROVEMENTS WE MIGHT MAKING CALIFORNIA. AS WE BEGIN OUR COMMITTEES EXAMINATION OF CALIFORNIA'S RECALL PROCESS I GO INTO THESE HEARINGS WITH AN OPEN MIND. I HAVE NOT YET MADE DECISIONS ABOUT SPECIFIC REFORMS THAT I MIGHT SUPPORT. BUT I HOPE THAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL BEGIN A STATE WIDE DISCUSSION ON CALIFORNIA'S RECALL LAWS. AND PROCEDURES. THAT WILL HELP INFORM OUR COMMITTEES FUTURE CONSIDERATION OF CHANGES TO THAT PROCESS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR STEAM PANELS OF EXPERTS. ABOUT POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR HOW CALIFORNIA'S RECALL PROCESS SHOULD BE REFORMED. SO THANK YOU TO THE WITNESSES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE TWO COMMITTEES THAT ARE HERE TODAY- AND I WILL NOW TURN IT THINGS OVER TO CHAIR GLAZER. FOR HIS OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR BERMAN WELCOME EVERYONE. I AM PLEASED THAT OUR TWO COMMITTEES ARE HOLDING THESE JOINT HEARINGS ON THE RECALL PROCESS. I THANK MY COUNTERPART IN THE ASSEMBLY FOR HIS PARTNERSHIP IN THIS. IMPORTANT EFFORT. I DO SUPPORT THE RECALL PROVISIONS OF OUR CONSTITUTION. AS AN IMPORTANT TOOL. TO ENSURE THAT LEADERS REMAIN ACCOUNTABLE. TO THE ELECTORATE. HOWEVER AS CHAIR BERMAN HAS INDICATED IT'S BEEN A HUNDRED TEN YEARS SINCE THE VOTERS ADDED THIS PROCEDURE TO OUR STATE CONSTITUTION. AND IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH RECALLS ARE CONDUCTED IN THE STATE DO NEED TO BE REVISITED. AND POTENTIALLY REFORM ACT. THE RECALL IS NOT INTENDED AND MUST NOT BECOME A BACK DOOR FOR THE LOSING SIDE OF AN ELECTION TO RE LITIGATE THOSE RESULTS. NOW RECALLS WHILE POTENTIALLY POSITIVE ARE DISRUPTIVE TO GOVERNANCE CAN EXACERBATE PARTISAN POLARIZATION. AND ARE TREMENDOUSLY EXPENSIVE. THE LAST GUBERNATORIAL RECALL COST TAXPAYERS OVER A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS TO PRODUCE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME OUTCOME IN TERMS OF VOTE PERCENTAGE IS THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALEXION THIS IS MONEY THAT CALIFORNIANS OVERWHELMINGLY AGREE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT ON MORE PRESSING CONCERNS LIKE ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY. NOW WE'VE ALL HEARD OF ANY VIEWS ABOUT THE RECALL AND HOW IT CAN BE FIXED WHICH WE APPRECIATE IN THE PUBLIC AROUND AND WE'LL HEAR MORE DURING THIS AND FUTURE HEARINGS. BUT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. REFORMING THE RECALL SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE IT SHOULD BE ABOUT GOOD GOVERNMENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING OUR EXPERTS. THAT OUR COLLEAGUES- ON THIS TOPIC AS WE PROCEED WITH THESE HEARINGS HERE BERMAN. THANK YOU CHAIR GLAZER IN L. WANT TO GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT TO. MIKE MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE EITHER FROM THE ASSEMBLY OR FOR THE SENATE IF ANYBODY WANTS TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS- HAPPY TO START WITH- DOES ANYBODY WANNA MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. SO IS IT A VENTURE VICE. YEAH PLEASE AS A YEAH I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I'M ALL FOR OF ANY TYPE OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE CAN MAKE TO ANY OF OUR PROCESS HE'S- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND- I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT SOME OF THE EXPERTS THAT HAVE DONE SOME REAL RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT. MATTER HAVE TO SAY. BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST BASTION OF CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE OFFER- FOR THE FOR THE VOTERS AND- IF WE'RE GOING DOWN A PATH WHERE WE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. FOR THEM TO- ACCESS THAT- YOU KNOW BUT I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE- WAYS OF DOING IT- IN A MORE EFFICIENT OR A BETTER MANNER THAT WE HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES- AND THEN- I'M OPEN TO HEARING THESE THINGS. BUT SOME OF THE THINGS I I'VE READ IN THE- LAST FEW WEEKS OF CONCERN TO ME. ABOUT MAKING THIS PROCESS HARDER AND- SOME OF THE SOME OF THE THINGS I'VE SEEN CAN HAVE THAT BUT THAT CHILLING EFFECT ON- ACCESS FOR VOTERS. TO- TO ENACT. OF SOMETHING THAT WILL- IT I GUESS FOR THE BETTER OF FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM JUST IF SOMEBODY HAS MAKING AND MADE A MISTAKE AND THEY'VE THEY REALIZE THAT THE PERSON THAT THEY ELECTED IS NOT WHO THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE- THEY SHOULD HAVE A RECALL PROCESS FOR THAT CHECKS AND BALANCES AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING PEOPLE'S REMARKS- LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE EXPERTS THAT HAVE STUDIED THIS. AND SEEING IF THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN MAKE A BETTER PROCESS THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE SERVICES ARTURO AND AT VICE YOU'RE NIELSEN THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US WE ARE READY TO HAPPEN TO HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS FROM YOU OR IF YOU WANT A MINUTE WE CAN GO TO DESIGNER MULLIN WHICHEVER YOU PREFER. YES. IT'S GOING TO BE A TODAY AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT I'VE ALREADY BEEN TWO HEARINGS ALREADY WITH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ON THE SUBJECT MATTER I WANT TO MAKE IT. COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS. NUMBER ONE I THINK THERE IS A VALID QUESTION. OF THE MERIT. IN A CHANGE. IN THE PROCESS AND THAT'S BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN SO SELDOM USED. AND ONLY TWICE SIX ROUGHLY. AT THE GUBERNATORIAL LEVEL. I WANT TO PREFACE MY REMARKS AND NOT LIMITLESS THIS IS NOT WORKING. I GOT I'VE TRIED GET. GET IT GET A THAT STAY UP ME HERE. NO FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE LET'S START OFF WITH POLLING I KNOW THERE'S BEEN PULLING OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I'VE ASKED THE QUESTION. HAS THAT POLLING INCLUDED IN THE QUESTION. THE LACK OF SUCCESS AND THE FREQUENCY OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. I THINK THAT'S NOT THE CASE THAT IF IT IS ANY FUTURE POLLING MUST INCLUDE. THAT REFERENCE FOR CONTEXT. IN WHETHER OR NOT. AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE A FAILING OF PAST. POLLING FURTHER. JUST THE AVALANCHE OF HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF LATE IS BROKEN SO BADLY. CAN THERE BE SOME CHANGES YES I THINK THERE CAN BE AND I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN THAT. BUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES I DON'T THINK SO. THE INITIATIVE AND THE REFERENDUM THE RECALL A VERY SACRED DIRECT DEMOCRACY OPPORTUNITIES REALLY PERFECTED IN THE STATE. AND UNLIKE THE C. NOT TRIVIALIZE THOSE. AND THERE'S ONE ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO ADD TO THE CONSIDERATION TODAY. AND THAT IS CAMPAIGN FUNDING LIMITS. FOR ALL PARTIES. THAT IS NOT NOW THE CASE. THEN WE'VE SEEN VERY DISPROPORTIONATE CONTRIBUTION. SO WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST CARES THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE HEARING IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION. BUT I'M GOING TO BE VERY RELUCTANT. TO DO ANYTHING THAT COMPROMISES. THE CITIZENS RIGHT TO DIRECTLY AFFECT THEIR FUTURES. AND WE DO NEED TO PAY HEED TOM DEGREE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT I DO NOT SEE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOLKS MUCH REPRESENTED HERE. AND NOR DO I FIND SOME. TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO NOT SUPPORT THE TAMPERING OR THE CHANGES THE RECALL PROCESS IT WOULD APPEAR TO ME THAT MOST WITNESSES OR AT LEAST DISPOSED MORE TOWARDS. CHANGE THEN OPPOSED TO CHANGE. AND THAT CONCERN THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR AND JUST A QUICK NOTE WE- AGREE WITH YOU ON ON CONCERNS AROUND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IN THE RECALL PROCESS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE- PLAN TO LOOK AT A FUTURE HEARING- SO SOME MORE TO COME. ON THAT CAN THANK YOU- NOW WE'RE JUST ON OUR MULLIN AS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS. JUST VERY BRIEFLY. MISTER CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR. OF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM SOME EXPERTS. I THINK IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. SOME FOR REFORM IS NEEDED I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING THE IDEAS TODAY BUT ULTIMATELY WHATEVER CHANGES PROPOSED HAS TO PASS MUSTER WITH THE VOTERS. I THINK VERY CLEARLY WANT TO MAINTAIN. A RECALL PROCESS BUT IF THERE'S A WAY TO SIMPLIFY. THE PROCESS MAKE IT'LL ACTUALLY LOOK MORE. CLEAR FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND I'D I'D BE. OPEN TO THAT I BE PREDISPOSED TO THAT I AM MOST INTRIGUED I WOULD SAY- BY THE SIMPLICITY OF A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SENDING TO THE GOVERNORSHIP. UPON A RECALL- YET SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED. ABOUT SOME PERVERSE INCENTIVES LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF A DIFFERENT PARTY PERHAPS- WORKING TO A WORKING WITH RECALL PROPONENTS TO HAVE A GOVERNOR RECALL SO THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR COULD ASCEND. ALL ONE WAY TO ADDRESS THAT IS IF WE JOIN THE TWENTY SIX. OTHER STATES WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ARE A TICKET. THEY ARE THE SAME ADMINISTRATION OF THE SAME PARTY SO IF THERE IS A REMOVAL OF THE GOVERNOR. UPON RECALL THE RESIGNATION THERE'S A CLEAR LINE OF SUCCESSION THERE'S CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT THEY ARE PART OF THE SAME ADMINISTRATION. WE SAW AN EXAMPLE IN NEW YORK NOT A RECALL. ABOUT A RESIGNATION BUT A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. OF IT OF THE SAME TICKET OF THE SAME PARTY OF THE SAME ADMINISTRATION ASCENDED TO THE GOVERNORSHIP SO THERE'S A WAY TO LOOK AT THE LINE OF SUCCESSION. ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO RECALL REFORM IT'S ABSOLUTELY RELEVANT TO- CREATING A STRUCTURE. OF THAT MAKE SENSE IN THE RARE OCCURRENCE OF A- OF A GOVERNOR BEING RECALL BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ALL THE IDEAS IN FACT MR STERN BOB STERN IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSING THOSE HAD GOVERNOR QUESTION. UNFORTUNATELY I WON'T BE IN THE ROOM I BELIEVE WHEN HE IS HERE. BUT I'LL BE LISTENING AND FOLLOWING THE HEARING AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR RESPECTIVE CHAIRS. ON UP ON FUTURE REFORMS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU MA'AM YOUR THOUGHT- COMMENTS WE'RE NOW MOVED OUR FIRST THE SPEAKER. PER THEIR PER. ON WHY CHANGE THE RECALL PROCESS. WE HAVE FOUR DISTINGUISHED WITNESSES STARTING OFF WITH OUR SECRETARY OF STATE. DR SHIRLEY WEBER. LED BY SUPERVISOR BRUCE MCPHERSON FORMER US SENATOR MARTHA SECUNIA AND FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER JIM CONVENE. OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS OUR CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE- DOCTOR WEBER SERVED IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE UNTIL HER APPOINTMENT. AS SECRETARY OF STATE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DURING HER TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE DR WEBER SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE. AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY PLEASED TO WELCOME SECRETARY WEBER WITH US THIS AFTERNOON SECRETARY WEBER. WELCOME TO A BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- TO THE TWO CHAIRS OF THE ELECTION COMMITTEE FROM THE ASSEMBLY- LISTED BERMAN AND FROM THE STATE AND FROM THE SENATE. I REALLY THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU- REMOTELY- TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF RECALL AND I KNOW WE HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. OF THE TWO NEED TO KNOW THAT- I TOO HAVE BEEN CONSULTING WITH THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS BECAUSE I THINK THE DECISION THAT WE MAKE IF THERE IS A DECISION HAS TO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. ALSO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PROTECTED REGARDLESS OF THE PARTY THAT THEY'RE IN- JUST SOME GENERAL INFORMATION I'M HERE TODAY TO REALLY CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT THE PROCESS THE RECALL THE TO PLACE- IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME AND BASICALLY HAVING TAKEN OFFICE IN PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS THAT I WAS. IMMEDIATELY THRUST IN THE MIDST OF A RECALL AND- AND ALL THE CHALLENGES AND ALL OF THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE RECALL MOST y DOORSTEP- AS WELL AS THIS LIST UP THE GROUND LEGAL COUNSEL AND WE SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME. IN LITIGATION AROUND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF RECALL SO I HAVE FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF LOOKING AT THE RECALL PROCESS IN RECALL LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF WHAT REALLY- WHAT WORKED AND WHAT MAKE PEOPLE CONFUSED. AND THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED FOR SOME CHANGE IN THE RECALL PROCESS. OF THE RECALL COST US-OUT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT DOESN'T COUNT ALL OF THEM THE RESOURCES THAT WENT INTO IT NOT ONLY JUST IN TERMS OF THE STATE. BUT IF YOU ADD IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WAS PAID OUT IN OUR CAMPAIGN- INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS I MEAN IT'S AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PROCESS THAT SHOULD NEVER BE INTO THE INTO THE LIKELY- BECAUSE OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT WILL HAVE NOT ONLY FINANCIALLY. BUT CONSEQUENCES TO PEOPLE'S LIVES WE MAILED OUT BALLOTS TO EVERY REGISTERED VOTER IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO US. BY THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE. TO SEND A BALLOT EVERY CALIFORNIA. WHICH MADE THE TURN OUT MUCH GREATER TURNOUT TO HAVE BEEN IN FACT. NEARLY 50% OF ALL THE RAGE VOTER. UP IN JUST A- IN THIS PARTICULAR RECALL. WAS ON YOUR ALL THIRTY MILLION. CALIFORNIANS IN THE PAST ELECTION OF THUS FAR AS WE HAVE TO FIND A CLOSE THE BOOKS. ARE THE RECALL AND ROUGHLY 38% VOTED YES. I IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO FORGET HOW QUICKLY THIS RECALL ELECTION HAPPEN IT WAS CONDUCTED IN IN IN IN IN A MERE SEVENTY FIVE DAYS. AFTER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR STATUS THE ELECTION DATE. WITH THE RESULTS NOW CERTIFIED- FROM THE FROM THE DATE THAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVE US THE PROCESS ITSELF WAS COMPLETED IN UNDER FOUR MONTHS. WHICH IS A WITH VOICE STATE THE SIZE IT IS DIFFICULT TO RUN SUCH ELECTION. WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES OF ALL THE CONCERNS- IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. SOME OF YOU KNOW THAT EVEN DOWN TO SOME OF THE SMALLEST DETAILS WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE DETAILS. OF FINDING PAPER ADEQUATE PAPER TO RUN THE BALLOTS ON AND TO SEND OUT THE- THE INFORMATION WAS A WAS A MAJOR CHALLENGE- THAT FORTUNATELY BECAUSE THOSE WHO HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE NEW ABOUT IT. BEGIN WORKING EARLY- FOR FEAR THAT THERE WOULD BE A RECALL AND THEREFORE WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE SOME VENDORS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT. THE RECALL LISTEN- WAS ESTABLISHED A PROCESS IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IT'S IN AND HOLDING TEN YEARS IN THE AND REMARKABLY THERE'S ONLY. MINOR CHANGES IN THE RECALL ELECTION PROCESS. ARE WE LIVING IN SOMEONE HISTORIC TIME SINCE THE RECENT RECALL ELECTION. IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY THE STATEWIDE RECALL HAS QUALIFIED AND RESULTED IN AN ELECTION. THE FIRST WAS IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND WITH THE RESULT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS. I THINK THIS GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY ASK PEOPLE HAD SAID THEY WOULD DO IN TWO THOUSAND THREE TO REFLECT ON HOW THE PROCESS WORKS. AND WHETHER THAT WORKS WELL FOR CALIFORNIA. IT GIVES US THAT AND THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE AND ELECTED OFFICIALS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW. AND CHANGE OR REFINE THE PROCESS THERE. I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARY HAVE ALL THE IN. THAT FAR AND OF ASKED ME TO. DO THEM WHAT I WE SHOULD DO AND I STILL. CA TO THE FACT THAT IT SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION WATER JUST MY- IT SHOULD BE A COME. AMONG AND THAT SO WE SHOULD BE ASKING SOME CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESS ITSELF- IS IT FAIR TO THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW IS IT FAIR TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT WE ARE BASICALLY. ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS AFTER THE PUBLIC IS DECIDED WHO THEY WANTED TO BE ELECTED. AND WE'RE ABLE TO BASICALLY MAKE A CHANGE WITH A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WILL RAISE THE ISSUE- IS IT. AS A SAID IS IT FAIR TO ALL VOTERS NOT JUST THE PUBLIC BUT THOSE WHO ACTUALLY THOUGHT. I HAD MANY VOTERS CONTACTED MY OFFICE SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FAIR THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. IT WAS JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANTED THIS AND WHY WE ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA- IS A GOOD FOR THE PROPONENTS ALSO WANT TO RECALL. ARE YOU KNOW SOMEONE ARGUED THAT THEY MADE THAT THEY ALSO WANT TO RECALL AND REALLY THEY ALSO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES. TO MAKE THE RECALL HAPPENED THAT THE WHOLE IDEA OF DIRECT GOVERNMENT. THAT THIS IS THE DESIGN TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAD A VOICE. BUT THAT VOICE NOW IS BEING DRIVEN BY MONEY MUCH MORE THAN ANY OTHER THING WITH REGARDS TO THE INITIATIVE TO GET TO THE BALLOT. AND THE RECALL IS ONE OF THOSE- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE FAIRNESS OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF IT'S A FAIR TO ACTUALLY RECALL OF AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN ALREADY ELECTRIC. AND THERE ISN'T AN OUTPOURING OF INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE THAT CHANGE AND IS IT FAIR TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. WHO CAN ACTUALLY BE RECALL FOR ANY REASON- AND I SOMETIMES WITHOUT REASON BECAUSE CONSISTENTLY I WAS ASKED. TELL CAN YOU TELL ME THE SPECIFIC REASONS THAT THE LAW THAT THIS PERSON BROKE. THAT THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY CREATED WHAT ARE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT LOST BECAUSE PEOPLE YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE CUSTOM THE FACT. THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT YOU DID WRONG THAT THERE WAS SOMEHOW YOU VIOLATED. YOUR CODE OF CONDUCT YOUR YOUR YOUR THE CODE OF CONDUCT OR THE LAWS THAT WERE IN PLACE WHAT LAW WAS BROKEN. AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BE BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T APPLY. BROKEN AND IT SAYS IN A LOW THAT YOU CAN RECALL PERSON. YOU CAN. THE REASONS WITH THOSE THREE. CAN NOW BE LIVING. HE NEVER READ THAT. BY ANYONE ELSE AND SO THEREFORE. YOU'RE TO DO THAT SO IT MAY WAYS WE LOOK AT THE- AND WE START AS A C. CLAUS. WAS A CALL. KA IN. DO EIGHT RECALL ELECTION- THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AND I WOULDN'T. ARGUE THAT THE MARK. HAS A COST TO IT BECAUSE FAIRNESS IN THE BAR. HAS NO. AND IT'S WORTH THE- LEVEL PAY. TO MAKE. IT BUT WHEN WE ASKED SOME THE OTHER- IT FOR THE WEB WITH THE GUY. TO THE MID. OF THE COUNTY. OFFICIALS TO. THE IN THE- THAT WILL. DEALING WITH A LOT OF THE YES. THAT FROM. US BECAUSEMANY OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY. IT HAD NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY. ARE HANDLED IN THE IN THE COURTS OR EVEN IN THE LEGISLATION THAT EXISTENCE ITSELF. THIS PRODUCED A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF LAWSUITS FOR US. IN OUR OFFICE IN FACT WE STILL HAVE SOME THAT REMAIN TODAY. UP IN THE MIDDLE SCHOOL- WHO MEDICAID IT WANTED TO DISCUSS THE RECALL AND WHETHER NOT THIS. THIS WAS A FAIR AND JUST PROCESS. MY ONLY CONCERN WITH A LOT OF THEM WAS THAT WHY DID YOU TELL ME THIS IN ADVANCE. IF YOU HAVE SOME CONSTITUTIONAL REASONS.% CONCERNING RECALLS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD LOTS OF US. AND HAVE THE COURTS WEIGH IN ON IT SO EVEN WITH GOOD REASONS AND GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE US. THE TIME FRAME WAS SO SHORT. THAT WE COULD NOT SPEND OUR TIME BATTLING THIS PIECE OF LET LEGISLATION WITH THIS LOSS OF THAT WAS THERE. MY PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE FACT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO GET IT DONE. AND WE HAVE TAKEN THE NORMAL PROCESS. OF LITIGATION IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BEYOND THE DATE FOR THE RECALL FAR BEYOND EVEN THE PRIMARY THAT WE WERE ENGAGED. AND SO I APPRECIATED MANY OF THE- SCHOLARS IN THE FIELD AND CAME UP WITH WONDERFUL DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS CONSTITUTIONAL. CAN WE ACTUALLY DO THERE'S A THERE'S A VIOLATE THE BASIC. ALL PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTES. THOSE A WONDERFUL DISCUSSIONS BUT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR IT. THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR AND I WISH THOSE. WHO HAVE SAID IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. WHEN WE HAD MANY OF THE CASES DECADES FOR THE BURDEN VERSUS SHELLEY CASE. I WISH THEY HAD BASICALLY TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FOUR FIVE OR SIX. SO THAT WE COULD THEN HAVE BETTER GUIDANCE WITH REGARDS TO IT SO. WE COULD NOT HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GUIDANCE BECAUSE OF THE- LEGISLATION ITSELF AS TO WHAT IS REQUIRED- WE COULD WE HAD TO TEAT THIS GENERAL ELECTION- AND THAT REALLY WAS ALMOST LIKE A PRIMARY. I COULD DO ELECTION. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SECOND ELECTION TO BE HELD IN SO ALL OF THESE THINGS. CREATED DIFFICULTY FOR THOSE WHO WERE. TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE PROCESS THOSE MUSCLE IMPLEMENTING IT. AND THEN THOSE SCHOLARS WHO BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THE WHOLE CONCEPT. OF THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MAJORITY VOTE IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. ARE WE HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME FORWARD TO US ALL OF THEM. YOU HAVE INDICATED IN YOUR OWN. A MATERIAL THAT YOU PUT OUT IN TERMS OF. WHAT IS APPROPRIATE AND INAPPROPRIATE AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AS ONE THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO. REQUIRE MAJOR CHANGE. BECAUSE WE'VE GROWN FROM ARLINGTON A GOVERNOR THAT SHE IS NOT WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE THAT. THE PERSON STEPS IN AND- OUT BUT AT THE SAME TIME- WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS TWO PARTIES IN THE AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT MIGHT EXIST. BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PARTIES THAT REQUIRES US TO REALLY LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT OUR PROCESS. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT- OF. THE ACT WE ARE WILLING TO GO THE FULL WAY IN TERMS OF MAKING A CHANGE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD BE CORRECTIVE SO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES. IF WE START DOWN THIS PATH WITHOUT REALLY GIVING CAREFUL THOUGHT. THE OUTCOMES OF EVERY ACTION THAT WE TAKE. ARM HOLDING A STATE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT. AND HOW WE'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO ELECTIONS AND- AND AFTER THAT COUNTIES WILL BE A STRONG AND A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES CAME THROUGH WITH THAT. BASICALLY OPERATED OF ELECTION IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT ALL OF US HAD GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS OF. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RUNNING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF. SIMPLE BUT THERE WERE NO BETTER PROCESS THAT WAS NO. NO FOR THE PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY HEAR THE IN THE- TO SEE WHAT THEY WERE. WITH THE FIFTH LARGE ECONOMY IN THE- IN WILL. AT CHANGE THE DUMP. WITH SOMEONE COULD HAPPEN LITTLE AS- FIRST. OF THAT IN AND THE ONLY WE KNOW SURE. THAT MOST FOLKS OVER THE- THAT IF WE REMOVE THIS GOT. IT IS CLEAR WE WILL HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO DOES NOT HAVE TO WITHDRAW. VOTE ARE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE TAKING PLACE IN THE SHORT TIME FRAME. WOULD REPAIR THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT. SO THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS AND WE MUST CONSIDER I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT WE LOOK AT THE STATE. THAT WE LOOK AT- THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TWO SEPARATE ELECTIONS AND SOME PEOPLE TALK WITH THAT IS. SPREAD OUT OVER MORE TIME IN TERMS OF DOING RECALL ELECTED TO SELECT A REPLACEMENT. ALL THESE THINGS HAVE TO BE THOUGHT OUT AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN THE TIME FRAME BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND. OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS A CERTAIN FROM FOR YEARS. SO BY THE TIME WE GET TO THE POINT OF RECALLS. THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TIME LEFT IN THEIR IN THEIR OFFICE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE CONCERNS PEOPLE REYES. SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RECALL ELECTION SB IN SEPTEMBER. THEY WERE GOING TO BASICALLY. THAT ONCE AGAIN HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION CONCERNING THIS PERSON IN ANOTHER NINE MONTHS AND WATER. WELL LET'S PEOPLE SAID WHAT A WASTE OF RESOURCES. NONETHELESS IT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BECAUSE WE DON'T WITH THE ISSUE SO. LET ME SAY THAT IN CLOSING I KNOW MY TIME IS UP- THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH REGARDS TO THIS THAT WE COOK. IT IS CLEAR THE CALIFORNIANS WANT A PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT LIKE RECALL OR OR OR HAVING PETITIONS BUT- AND THIS IS PUT ON BALLOTS THEY THEY WANT THIS PROCESS. EVEN NO MATTER HOW FLAWED IT IS THAT THEY WANT. BUT IT CAN'T BE A WHOLE LOT EASIER AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO HAVE. MORE TEETH TO- THERE HAS TO BE MORE DIRECTION TO WHAT. I PERSONALLY CONSULTING WITH A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONSTITUTIONAL. ATTORNEYS AS WELL AS THOSE WHO BEEN IN POLITICAL OFFICE ON BOTH SIDES OF. THE AISLE TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING CONCERNED. WE CALL. AND WE WILL. AB HOPEFULLY WE IN WITH YOUR REGULAR. CONCERNING WHAT WE SEE. AS THOSE WORDS. OF THE ELECT. AND NOT JUST MYSELF. BUT THE RED STROBE. UP AND- THE STATE. AS TO WHAT WOULD MAKE IT A FAIR. CLEAR ACROSS. SINCE PEOPLE. PURCHASE IN. AND TO DO THIS. KEEP IN MIND THAT. THOUGH WE ONLY SEEN A FEW. IN TERMS OF THE- PLEASE. WE ARE SEEING A- OF RECALL ACROSS THE STATE AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT THAT WERE WE TO SEE IT. NOW AND THEN. WE STILL WE HAVE I THINK FIVE SIX SEVEN OF THOSE THIS YEAR. WE HAVE ANOTHER FORTY YEARS UP TO GOAL. ARE WE WOULD HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WILL BE COMING IN AND WE HAVE RECALLS PREPARE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO. VERSUS COUNTY VERSES. OF VERSUS STATE IN TERMS OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR BALLOTS. ASKED WITH FINDING THAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE. SIX SIX MONTHS IN OFFICE AND IMMEDIATELY PEOPLE WANT TO RECALL THEM. AND THE PEOPLE WANT TO CALL THEM OF THE SAME PEOPLE WHO VOTE. WITHIN BOTH OF THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THIS IS BECOME AN ISSUE. AND IT GOES ON AND ON AND I'VE SEEN FOLKS WITH TWO DIFFERENT RECALL PETITIONS AGAINST THEM. ALREADY AND SO IT HAS BECOME. A GREAT CONCERN IN MY MIND SIMPLY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE ARE USING THIS. TO GET AROUND THE PROCESS THAT IMMEDIATELY. THEY THEY GO TO RECALL. AND IF AND IF THE RESOURCE IS A RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE MONEY TO. FOR THOSE WHO CAN COLLECT PETITIONS. ASSIGNED POSITIONS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. WE DISCOVER THAT RECALLS ARE OCCURRING SO I AM CONCERNED. THAT MANY RECALLS ARE CURRENT SCHOOL BOARD'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CITY COUNCILS. OF SEVERAL IN MY CITY OF SAN DIEGO. HE WAS ADOPTED FOR RECALLS THAT THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE TAKEN OUT SOME YEARS AGO. SO NOW WE GOT TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION. THAT THIS THING THAT WAS ONCE A VERY RARE. AND UNUSUAL IS BECOMING THE NORM. AND WE WANTED TO BECOME THE NORM. BECAUSE IF WE DEAL THEN WAS SOMEHOW THE CONSTANTLY. ATTACKING IN INVALIDATING ELECTIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED. ONLY BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DECIDE THEY DON'T LIKE A DECISION THAT WAS MADE. WE DON'T HAVE A REASON FOR. MY OFTENTIMES PEOPLE ARE SAYING TO ME CONSISTENTLY. YOU'VE ALSO GOT A PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO BRING THE CHARGES. IN CONCERNS. ARE AND- AND THEN AS BASED ON THAT ARE NOT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PURCHASE. OF THAT TAKES TIME TO. AND BUT NONETHELESS FOLKS FEEL THAT MAYBE. BECAUSE IT IS AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT HAPPEN THIS RECALL. SO ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- PREPARED AS ANYONE HAS A QUESTION- I DON'T HAVE. THE ANSWER TO. THESE QUESTIONS BUT I DO KNOW. THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT OUR RECALL PROCESS AND WHILE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT IT. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH MAKING SOME OF THE NATION'S UNLIKE WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. SECRETARY WEBER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THERE MAY BE SOME QUESTIONS IF YOU COULD STAND BY. LET ME JUST NOTE DOLLAR PRECIADO SHOULD. FOR THE DEEP BUT CONSUL TATIAN THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN A WE LOOK FOR TO GETTING YOUR FEEDBACK. THROUGHOUT DELIVERED PROCESS. AND APPRECIATE THAT. AND LET ME JUST TAKE THE PRAGUE OF THE FOR JUST A- AND THANK YOU TO YOU. FOR THE- X. ADVENTIST. OF THIS. THE UNDER. TO TIMES. AS YOU SO NOTED. NOT JUST YOUR OFFICE. AND YOUR LEADERSHIP BUT TO THE FIFTY EIGHT THE CLERKS AND REGISTRARS AROUND THE STATE. WHO REALLY HAD TO WORK VERY VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTION. WAS DONE APPROPRIATELY AND IT WAS DONE FAIRLY. HONESTLY AND APPROPRIATELY AND WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL. COLLEAGUES WANT TO SEE. QUESTIONS FOR THE SECRETARY BEFORE WE LET HER GO- NUMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. NOW YES SIR OKAY- SECTOR WEBER YOU AND TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF RECALLS THAT ARE ARE HAPPENING AND SOME RESEARCH INDICATES I WE HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE ATTEMPTS SINCE NINETEEN THIRTEEN THANKS CORRECT. STE YES I THINK SO YES OKAY AND OF THOSE ATTEMPTS. ELEVEN QUALIFIED FOR BALLOT. RIGHT SO TAKING OUT PAPERS TO DO A RECALL DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO A RECALL EFFORT AND IT DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO THE COSTS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MUCH OF WHICH IS THERE ARE A LOT OF WHICH IS THE MAILIN BALLOTS- I BELIEVE THOSE ARE WHAT THREE DOLLARS APIECE TO SEND OUT. AND GET BACK. YES YEAH. SO WHAT WE HAVE 51% TURNOUT THAT MEANS 49% OF THOSE BALLOTS- WERE ESSENTIALLY NOT USED. IN ANOTHER 58% TURNOUT FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT. NOW INCLUDES 42% OF THOSE WEREN'T USED WHICH IS ADDING TO THE COST SO I SHARE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING TO- TWO SEPARATE ELECTIONS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF. OF COSTLY HABIT SOME OF THAT IS SELF INFLICTED. SOME OF THOSE- THEY QUALIFIED ABOUT TWO OF THEM WERE FOR GOVERNOR CORRECT. YES SO THOSE TO MISTER DAVIS BACK GOVERNOR DAVIS AND THEN THIS ONE. AND THIS ONE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE QUALIFIED IF THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM DIDN'T REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL. I THINK IT WAS FOR THREE MONTHS- HELP YEAH TWENTY DAYS. YES SO THIS ONE WOULDN'T QUALIFY TO DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S AN EASY PROCESS AT ALL. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS. I WOULD NEVER SAY IT YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE CORRECT I NEVER SAY THAT THAT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS EASY IT IS MADE EASIER BY THOSE WHO CAN HIRE PEOPLE TO COLLECT SIGNATURES IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT ALL BUT IT'S NOT AN EASY PROCESS BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE TO COLLECT THE SIGNATURES AND IT'S EXPENSIVE TO COLLECT SIGNATURES YES AND IT LOOKS LIKE ELEVEN ELEVEN TIMES IN A HUNDRED YEARS. THAT HAPPENED THEY WERE ABLE TO COLLECT ENOUGH SIGNATURES SO THAT'S RIGHT BUT KEEP IT OPEN WE SEE THE PROLIFERATION OF FOLKS TAKING OUT A BALLOTS NOW OR TAKING UP POSITIONS NOW RECALL MUCH MORE THAN THAT HE SAID YOU HAD A HUNDRED AND SOME LOT OR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. THAT NUMBER IS BEING IT IS INCREASING- RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK WITH THE NUMBER OF RECALLS THAT ARE THAT THE PETITIONS ARE BEING TAKEN OUT NO QUESTION RULES I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR EXPERTISE ON THE SITUATION THANK YOU ASSEMBLY. RATA AT YOUR BERMAN WITH A FOLLOW UP QUESTION THANKS JUST SPEAKING OF THE PROLIFERATION OF THIS OF RECALLS QUALIFYING DUTCH WEBER ALL RIGHT THAT THAT JOY LEVIN HAVE QUALIFIED IN IN A HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS BUT BUT THREE OF THOSE QUALIFIED IN IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS THAT THE RECALL EXISTED- AND THEN EIGHT OF THE ELEVEN HAVE QUALIFIED IN THE LAST TWENTY. SEVEN YEARS. IS THAT CORRECT SO WE- THREE RECALLS. IN THE FIRST EIGHTY SO ODD YEAR- BUT EIGHT. QUALIFY IN THE LAST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. RIGHT SO WE'RE DEFINITELY SUCCEED LIKE YOU WERE SAYING SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE QUALIFICATION NOT AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE UTILIZATION OF THIS TACTIC- BYE BYE FOLKS- IN IN STATEWIDE AND ALSO IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. RIGHT WE HAVE AND WE HAVE RECALLS THAT WOULD BETTER QUALIFIED TO THIS YEAR WELL THAT RECALLS IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO ARE READY FOR THEM QUALIFY. AND WE CURRENTLY HAVE FORTY UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE COLLECTING SIGNATURES AGAINST LOCAL OFFICIALS SO WE ARE WE'RE SAYING TO INCREASE OF UP AS AS I TALK TO BRIDGE TROUBLED TO SEE AN INCREASE IN PEOPLE COMING IN TO TAKE APPLICATIONS. ARE AND THOSE AND OBVIOUSLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE HUNDRED YEARS YOU SAY OKAY YEAH HUNDRED SOMETHING IN A HUNDRED YEARS IT'S PROBABLY A ONCE A YEAR BUT- YOU'RE HAVING MUCH MORE THAN THAT RIGHT NOW. THANKS ARE DUE OVER SIX ALL RIGHT I THANK EACH YEAR BERMAN- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE SECRETARY. ALL RIGHT SEE NOT SECRETARY WEBER AGAIN OUR THANKS FOR. ALL THAT YOU DO IN YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. IN THE MONTHS AHEAD THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU YOU TAKE HERE HAVE A GOOD MEETING OKAY SO WE'RE- GONNA. TO OUR NEXT WITH. US MICK FEAR. A SUPER. MCPHERSON WAS FIRST ELECTED TO THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. REELECTED IN 200-016-2000 TWENTY. HE CURRENTLY SERVES AS CHAIR OF THE BOARD. HE PERMIT PREVIOUSLY SERVED TWO TERMS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. AND TO TERMS AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE. BEFORE BEING NAMED BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AS CALIFORNIA'S. SECRETARY OF STATE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US SUPERVISOR. MCPHERSON AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. I THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S- INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON OUR- STATE PROCEDURE FOR RECALL INDIVIDUALS. WHETHER IT'S ACCEPTABLE NOW WERE AND WHAT IF ANY CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE TO APPROVE SYSTEM. OXEN HONORED TO BE HERE WITH SECRETARY OF STATE ARCHERY WEBER. I WANT MY TWO OF MY FORMER LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUE STYLE SENATOR WHAT'S GOOD YEAH. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM KINNEY. AFTER GRADUATIONS CHIU THE SENATE AND SOME ELECTIONS COMMITTEE STAFF TO PARTICULAR QUALITY OVERVIEW OF THE RECALL PROCESS. WORKS VERY WELL DONE- I'M GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THAT YEP THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR- AND REALIZED THAT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER LOCAL RACES THAT ARE UP. FOR GRABS SO TO SPEAK- SUBJECT TO RECALL- BACK THROUGH THE MOST OFTEN SUGGESTED CHANGES IN TODAY'S SYSTEM. ARE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY THE RECALL FOR THE BALLOT SHORTEN THE TIME FRAME. TO ACQUIRE THOSE SIGNATURES. OR SOMEHOW REDUCE THE COST TO THE PUBLIC. TO CARRY OUT THE RECALL PROCESS. I DO BELIEVE THAT- THOSE WHO WANT TO. THE SHOULD IT. THE OTHER END OF THE- THERE SHOULD BE SOME SOLID EVIDENCE OF MALFEASANCE OF THE- WHICH AFFECTED THE RECALL. BEFORE THE PROCESS START- ONLY SB NO ONLY TO RECALL HIM AGAIN I'M FOCUSING ON THE GOVERNOR OF QUALIFIED NOT PASSED HUNDRED YEARS. ONE SITUATED AND ONE DIDN'T AND EVEN IN THE SUCCESSFUL ONE THE REPLACEMENT DIDN'T GET A MAJORITY OF THE VOTE. A REAL SHORTFALL I THINK IN TODAY'S SYSTEM IS THAT AN OPPONENT RUNNING TO REPLACE INCUMBENT. MAY ONLY GET A FRACTION OF THE VOTE COMPARED TO THE ONE WHO WAS RECALL. RECALL VOTE MAYBE FIFTY POINT ONE PERCENT. AND THE NEW GOVERNOR ONE OF THIRTY FORTY FIFTY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SEE HER NAME ON THE BALLOT- THEY- THEY BECOME THE WINNING OPTIONS SO TO SPEAK WITH TWENTY OR 30% OF THE VOTE. A CORRECTION TO THIS COULD BE TO HAVE. TO SEE ELECTION PROCESS IN WHICH THE RECALL INCUMBENT RUNS AGAINST THE TOP VOTE GETTER OF THE CHALLENGERS ANY SUBSEQUENT ELECTION. THAT'S MORE TIME MORE COST. OF I'M NOT SUGGESTING THIS- JUST TRYING TO THINK. OF THE BIG PROBLEMS THAT WERE PROCESS. FROM THE PUBLIC- WHO REALLY. ARE PRESUMABLY WANTS CHANGES. BACK TO RECALL. THE JURY ORDERS FOR THE RECALL AND- INDISCRIMINATE DATA PUBLIC THAT'S ALSO RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE. I'M OPTION BE ROUGHLY BE ALLOW THE BRIEF. I'VE GOT TO APPEAR ON A SECOND QUESTION ON THE RECALL BALLOT. IF YOU'RE C. GETS THE MOST VOTES ON THE SECOND QUESTION HERE SHE STAYS IN OFFICE- ANOTHER SUGGESTION. SPEAKING IN TERMS OF THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL IS TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR REQUESTED CHECK IT IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED- IF THE GOVERNOR'S RECALLED. GOVERNOR BECOMES GOVERNOR. BUT THAT MISSES THE POINT THAT IF THE CONTENT GOVERNOR'S SAME PARTY AS THE RECALL ELECTED NEW GOVERNOR MUCH OF THE- PUBLIC WILL SAY THIS CONTINUES THE SAME. POLICY AS GOVERNOR WHO WAS JUST RECALLED. THE GOAL SHOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE VOTERS TO SAVE THE RECALL FOR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY OR MALFEASANCE RATHER THAN BECAUSE OF. OPPOSITION S. DIRECTLY ATTENDED GOVERNOR'S CALIFORNIA GET VERY LITTLE ATTENTION FROM THE GOVERNOR DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN SOMETIMES. I EVEN BEING IN DIFFERENT PARTIES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC HAS VERY LITTLE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE OF WHETHER THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR YES OF THE STATE ON THE SAME PAGE AS THE GOVERNOR ON CRITICAL ISSUES OF THE DAY. AND FINALLY COST ABOUT HOW TO SAVE ELECTION CROSS YEAH IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WERE SPENT ON THIS- BUT THAT'S THE PROCESS WE HAPPENED WHAT WHAT BE SURE WHAT WHAT IT TAKES TO GET SOMETHING. ON THE BALLOT THE SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT TODAY TO TAKE PLACE. BUT IF A RECALL IS APPROVED. AB ONE TEN A COVER BECOME THE INTERIM GOVERNOR. SUBSEQUENT ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR WOULD BE REQUIRED NOT PERMITTED AS IN STATE LAW NOW REQUIRED IN THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED GENERAL ELECTION. THE PROBLEM MY DATA PUBLIC HAS A PATIENTS AGAIN TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION TO ELECT A NEW GOVERNMENT. SO I'M JUST BRIEFLY AND WRAP IT UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CURRENT RECALL. PROCESS IS PERFECT BUT I THE VOICE OF THE VOTING PUBLIC. SHOULD BE HEARD AND THEY HAVE A TRUE GOD AND BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF THE INCUMBENT. THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO GO THROUGH A RECALL PRESS PROCESS. I HAVEN'T SEEN AS WAS MENTIONED BY SECRETARY WEBER. THE GROUP OPTION TO DATE RECALL PROCESS THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE AND ACCEPTABLE. TO WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. I DO BELIEVE THAT ANY CHANGES SHOULD BE- HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. BY THE PUBLIC ONCE THAT THE AND THIS THIS ISSUE DESERVES THAT. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES ANSWER AND CERTAINLY IF WE DO PUT SOMETHING ON THE- BALLOT AND THE BALLOT TO CHANGE ITS CONSTITUTION. KEEP IT SIMPLE AND FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT DIFFICULT. BUT IT'S GREAT FORWARD SO PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE UNSURE AREN'T OUT THERE YOU PROBABLY GET A VOTE NO. THAT'S JUST THE HISTORY OF THE BOAT. SO THAT'S A REAL QUICK SUMMARY OF MARKET- OVERVIEW AND I'M JUST AS I SAID POSTING ON THE GOVERNOR. THE OFFICE OF GOVERNOR- UP BUT DIED BECAUSE THAT WAS WITH THE MOST RECENT RECALL WEEK REPORTS WE HAD TO GO THROUGH BUT THERE'S SOME SEVERAL PENDING. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND- IT'S A PARTICULARLY IN EFFORT TO GET IT RIGHT AND I WISH EVERYONE THE BEST AND THAT WOULD BE GLAD TO. PARTICIPATE NAY OF POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT I CAN HELP IN ANY WAY THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON AND- CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICES- ISAAC AS CALIFORNIA SECRETARY OF STATE- I WANT TO. ALL LACK. THAT NOTE THAT YOU. A DOLLAR ONE OF THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS THAT WAS PER BY A STAFF THANK YOU TO BOTH STAFF AND THE SIDES AND UP TO THE MEMBERS OF PUBLIC- CAN HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND THE DATA AND FACT THAT IT PROVIDES CERTAINLY FROM OUR WEBSITE IN THE ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE APPRECIATE YOU POINTING THAT OUT. I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU POINTING OUT THAT YOUR DESIRE TO. SEARCH FOR A BI PARTISAN SOLUTION. THAT THAT THERE'S WAYS TO MAKE THIS PROCESS BETTER. AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS. YOU DID NOT SPEAK TO THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT THAT'S CURRENTLY AT LAW IS THERE ANY COMMENT YOU HAVE ON THAT. FOR ME- I YEAH I THINK YOU'RE GREAT THE ONLY WAY TO UP SHOWN MORE RECALLS FROM TAKING PLACES TO INCREASE THE NUMBER THAT REQUIRE OUT FROM FROM THE TESTING LAW- THERE ARE TO BE A REASON FOR THAT- I THINK IT MAYBE TO. LOOK AT HOW MANY VOTES ARE- MADE FOR RECALL AND KEEPER AN OFFICER UP THERE IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNOR IN OFFICE COMPARED TO THE RECENT PAST OF PROBABLY HALF THE VOTER LAST OF THOSE WHO WOULD TAKE THAT THAT- GOVERNOR'S. PLACE I THINK THAT. WE SHOULD IT. DOUBT PEOPLE TO I WELL I WOULDN'T THE ID OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF. REQUIRED I THINK THAT WOULD GIVE MORE. IT'S NOT EASY TO DO SO NOW BUT I DO I DO BELIEVE THAT- THAT WOULD BE. A LOGICAL WAY TO- SHE WAS A TONE DOWN THE RECALL PROCESS BUT AGAIN I WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THAT WITH A FOCUS BE ON SOME OF. MALFEASANCE OFFICE OF SOME TYPE OR PERSON IS RECALL THAT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DETERMINE PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS. TRAFFIC ON TO SEE IF THAT COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. I'M A GOOD QUESTION ONLY NUMBER SIR ON YOUR YOUR COMMENT ABOUT MALFEASANCE. YEAH IS THAT LEGAL MALFEASANCE OR IS THAT ETHICAL MALFEASANCE BECAUSE MALFEASANCE CAN BE WOULD MEAN ONE THING TO THE LEGAL COMMUNITY BETTER CAN MEAN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING TO CITIZENS OUT THERE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE REPRESENTATIVES NOT ACTING IN THEIR BEST INTEREST ANYMORE TO THEM THAT'S MALFEASANCE SO WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LEGAL. DEFINITION WELL I THINK IN LEGAL I'M ONLY I'VE BEEN IN THE NEWSPAPER BUSINESS AND I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS I'M NOT A LAWYER BUT I WOULD DOUBT. I WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LEGAL PROCESS TO SOME TYPE BOB BUT NOW AGAIN THAT TIME AND- WE'RE TALKING SOMETHING WE WANT TO GET RESOLVED- WITHIN YOU KNOW BOB. THREE TO SIX MONTHS AT THE MOST UNDER CONDITIONS I'D MENTION ABOUT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TAKING COVERED SPOT AND THEN HAVING THAT SUBSEQUENT ELECTION POSSIBLY BUT- I THINK THAT THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME PROOF OF MALFEASANCE- JENNIFER. OKAY THANK YOU TERRIFIC ANY FURTHER. FOR SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON. ALL RIGHT SEEN UNSUPERVISED MACPHERSON THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING IN OUR HEARING TODAY I KNOW CENTER NIELSEN AND I BOTH LOVE IT WHEN FORMER CENTERS COME BACK- LOOK TO THE RED CARPET ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GREEN CARPET HERE IN THIS ROOM. TO SHARE THEIR EXPERTISE AND- AND WISDOM WITH US SO THANK YOU SO MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR NEXT WITNESS- IT'S FORMER SENATOR MARTHA STUDIA. A SENATOR ESTUDIOS CURRENTLY VICE PRESIDENT FOR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA POSITION SHE'S HELD SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN- PRIOR TO SIZE SERVING AS A- AT U. S. C. SHE WAS A PARTNER AT THE SENATORS A LAW AND CONSULTING FIRM SHE CO FOUNDED. CENTER STUDIO IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE FROM NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND SIX MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY FROM NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WAS THE FIRST WOMAN CHAIR OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES SENATOR A STUDIO WELCOME. TO OUR JOINT HEARING AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE THIS COULD BE AND IT REALLY IS A PLEASURE TO BE BACK HERE- BACK AT LEAST YOU KNOW THROUGH. KNOWN TO BE BACK IN THAT BEAUTIFUL. ROOM AND OF COURSE FOR ME IT'S WONDERFUL TO EVEN SEEING. MY FORMER COLLEAGUES BRUCE BRUCE AND JIMMY- IT'S JUST A PLEASURE TO SEE THEM- THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING QUESTION THAT I WAS ASKED TO. GIVE MY PERSONAL OPINION NOT USC'S OPINION MY PERSONAL OPINION. AND I'M TAKING IT RATHER SERIOUSLY AS A LAWYER. THAT'S THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S. AND THAT IS YOU KNOW- WHY THE RECALL. AND I SPEAK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING BEEN THROUGH A PREVIOUS RECALL. WHEN GOVERNOR DAVIS WAS RECALL. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY NOW AS A CITIZEN I WANT ANOTHER RECALL WHEN THE WITH ATTEMPT TO RECALL GOVERNOR NEWSOM. BUT I ALWAYS ASK WHY THE RECALL SO WHEN I DID MY RESEARCH ON THE REASONS WHY THE PROPONENTS. FILED A RECALL PETITION AGAINST GOVERNOR NEWSOM. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. I REMEMBER THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY THE ECONOMY SHUT DOWN. BECAUSE THE COBIT. BUT AS THE FAVORITE TWENTY TWENTY THE REASONS ASSERTED AND I'M GOING TO JUST. YOU KNOW MENTION SOME OF THEM WAS THEM. THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IMPLEMENTED LAWS. WHICH ARE DETRIMENTAL TO THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. THAT LAWS THAT HE ENDORSED. A COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. OVER THAT OF OUR OWN CITIZENS- THAT HE UNILATERALLY OVERRULE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE WITH REGARD TO THE DEATH PENALTY. AND HE ALSO IMPOSE ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON OUR STATE. BY REMOVING PROTECTIONS OF PROP THIRTEEN. RATIONING WATER USE- AS WELL AS THEM THE CLEARING- IMPOSING A CENTURY STATE STATUS. ON CALIFORNIA. AND IT GOES FURTHER ON- SO. ATTENTION TO THE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHEN I THAT. TO ME IT SOUNDS LIKE A- TO. WITH A DULY ELECTED OFFICER A DULY ELECTED GOVERNOR. BUT ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT IS EIGHT RECALL ADULTS OFFENSE. AND WHAT STATUS DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW US POLICY MAKERS AND EVEN US AS CITIZENS WHAT STATUS DO WE HAVE TO GUIDE US. AS TO WHAT IS A RECALL OFFENSE. AND FROM THE INITIAL RESEARCH THAT I HAVE DONE- I REALLY HAVEN'T FOUND MUCH INFORMATION. SO I STARTED LOOKING AT DIFFERENT SCENARIOS AND RIGHT AWAY I LOOKED AT THE- THE STATUTORY SCHEME FOR THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES. NOW GRANTED FEDERAL JUDGES ARE APPOINTED GRANTED THEIR APPOINTED FOR LIFE AND GRANTED WE HAVE TO ENSURE THEIR IMPARTIALITY. BUT THE STANDARD TO REMOVE A FEDERAL JUDGE IS VERY HIGH IT BASICALLY AMOUNTS. TO- EIGHT AM. GET A BASICALLY THIS EIGHT DISAVOWAL WITH YOU KNOW THE TREASON PART OF BRIBERY AND OTHER HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I OUR OWN U. S. CONSTITUTION IS SILENT AS TO HOW YOU WOULD DEFINE ESPECIALLY HIGH CRIMES. HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT WHEN I WAS DOING RESEARCH ON THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES IT TURNS OUT THAT I FOUND OUT THAT FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE. WILLIAM REHNQUIST ACTUALLY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT THE REMOVAL OF FEDERAL JUDGES. AND HE CONCLUDED THAT THE EARLY USES OF IMPEACHMENT TO REMOVE FEDERAL JUDGES. HAVE ESTABLISHED A NOR. THE NORM BEING THAT JUDICIAL ACTS THAT THE LEGAL RULINGS FROM THE BENCH WILL NEVER BE A BASIS FOR REMOVAL FROM OFFICE. SO BASICALLY THAT MEANS THAT IF LITIGANTS ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE CASE. THOSE WOULD NOT BE THE GROUNDS TO REMOVE A UDGE THE ONLY OPTION IS TO APPEAL THE DECISION. SO IN THE RECALL SITUATION THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING RIGHT NOW. IF THE RECALL PROPONENTS WERE UNHAPPY WITH THE LAWS THAT GOVERN A NUISANCE SIGN THEM THE PROPER REMEDY WOULD BE TO GO TO COURT. TO SEEK AN INJUNCTION AND TO BASICALLY STOP THOSE LAWS FROM TAKING EFFECT THAT'S THE PROPER REAP A REMEDY. SO BASICALLY WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST HONORABLE MEMBERS IS KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON WHAT MY DEAR FRIEND BRUCE MCPHERSON MENTION WHICH IT HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF MALFEASANCE AND GRANTED THERE'S FRANKLY NOT DEFINITION OF TO HELP MALFEASANCE- IS DESCRIBE WHAT'S WHAT'S THE CHECKLIST. SO WHAT I STARTED DOING WAS IDENTIFY STATES. THAT HAVE RECALL STATUTES BUT ONLY FOR CLAUSE. AND I THINK THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN ELEVEN OF THEM IN THE COUNTRY OF WHICH ONE OF. THEM IS THE STATE OF GEORGIA. NOW THE STATUS OF DRAW SAYS GROUNDS FOR RE IN. THAT THE OFFICIAL HAS COME AND- OF MALFEASANCE WHILE IN OFFICE. TO THE OFFICIAL VIOLATED THE OATH OF OFFICE. THREE THE OFFICIAL HAS COMMITTED AN ACT OF MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE. FOR THE OFFICIALS GUILTY OF THE FAILURE TO PERFORM DUTIES PRESCRIBED BY LAW. AND FIVE THE OFFICIAL HAS WILLFULLY WILLFULLY MISCUES CONVERTED OR MISAPPROPRIATED WITHOUT AUTHORITY PUBLIC PROPERTY OR PUBLIC FUNDS ENTRUSTED TO THAT OFFICIAL. NOW THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS. ABOUT THIS FOR COST REQUIREMENT IN GEORGIA IS THAT IT ALSO HAS AN INTERMEDIATE INTERMEDIATE PROCESS AND THAT IS THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE A LEGAL ADJUDICATION BY A JUDGE. AS TO WHETHER COST DOES EXIST IN THIS DIVISIONAL ADJUDICATION OF COST FOR A RECALL WHICH I REALLY THINK IT'S A WORTHY IDEA TO ALSO INCLUDE YOUR IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS. IT WOULD BASICALLY ALLOW THE JUDGE. WHICH I TRULY THAT IT SUMPAH. I'M GRANTED% SOME PEOPLE MAY ARGUE THAT POLITICAL BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW ALMOST VERYTHING IN LIFE IS POLITICAL BUT I HAVE BIG BELIEF IN THE JUDICIARY. I'M IF WE HAVE JUDICIAL EDUCATION EDUCATION AS TO WHETHER BECAUSE EXISTS. THEN IT BASICALLY PROVIDES GUARDRAILS TO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF RECALL I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS HEE TO SAY WE DON'T LIKE RECALLS I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS HERE TO STAY. LET'S DESTROY THIS VERSION OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE HERE TO SAY THAT LET'S PUT SOME SOME GUARD RAILS. AROUNDTHIS. EXERCISE IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY SO THAT RECALL INSTEAD BE A REMEDY THAT IS JUDICIOUSLY USED. NOT **** NILLY BUT RATHER JUDICIOUSLY USED PREFERABLY FOR BECAUSE THE HAS BEEN ADJUDICATED. BY A JUDGE FINALLY I'M SECRETARY STATE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY MENTION THE COSTS. OF A RECALL AND THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ME IS JUST AMAZING BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA IS ENGAGING IN A RECOVERY IT'S STILL VERY MUCH A LOPSIDED RECORD ECONOMIC RECOVERY. OF THE HAS A RECOVERING VERY NICELY BUT THE HAVE NOTS ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM JOB INSECURITY EDUCATIONAL LEGALIZATION BROADBAND MARGINALIZATION SO THE IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE IT THE STATE WITH THREE HUNDRED MILLION AND I KNOW THAT YOU. ESTATE LAWMAKERS HAD PLENTY OF MONEY THIS LAST BUDGET SEASON AND I KNOW THERE'S PLENTY OF MONEY ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT BUDGET SEASON BUT GUESS WHAT THE MONEY IS NOT GOING TO LAST FOREVER. AND I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH THE- THE VERY LEAN BUDGET TIMES. IN A IN SACRAMENTO AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT GOOD TIMES TRIPPED OUT TRUST ME. THEIR NECK WITH. SO THE ECONOMIC COST OR ARE HE- THERE'S ALSO WHAT I CALL THE- OF THE- LET'S BE HONEST WE'RE ALL HUMAN. THE GOVERNOR WAS DISTRACTED AND SO WAS THE LEGISLATURE DISTRACTED DIST DIST DISTRACTED BY THAT THE RECALL- I WILL ALSO ADD TO THAT THE COST OF CONFUSION. YOU KNOW VOTERS YOU KNOW ARE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE I THOUGHT WE JUST ELECTED A GOVERNOR A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. STILL THERE IS THE COST OF CONFUSION AND WHEN VOTERS ARE CONFUSED YOU KNOW PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY SUFFERS. AND LASTLY I'M GONNA SPLIT SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE MY SALE MIGHT THERE BE TO BRUTALLY HONEST BUT THAT'S MY STYLE. AND AT. AND THE OTHER THE BEST COST I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THE COST OF AVOIDANCE. AND THAT IS THAT EVERY IS BIG. YOU KNOW YOU'RE UNDER A CLOUD OF A RECALL AND EVERYBODY'S UNDER THAT CLOUD NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR BUT SO IS THE LEGISLATURE. WHAT I MEAN BY COST AVOIDANCE IS THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME HUGE HUGE ISSUE WITH WHICH ONLY BE ADDRESSED. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE BASICALLY FUNNELLED THROUGH WHAT AT ALL A PRISM OF RECALL POLITICS. I'M BEING REALLY HONEST AND THAT'S THE BARE BONES TRUTH AND WE'RE ALL GUILTY OF IT AS REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. WE ALWAYS TRY TO GET. THE BIG ISSUES. BUT THAT THANK YOU THAT MIGHT CUSTOMER IS OVER WELL IF YOU COULD WRAP UP CENTERS. PRITCHETT ALL YOUR SITE. I JUST BASICALLY ONE TO SAY THAT. THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO DO. SAY FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATION ON BEHALF OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IT TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO DO THAT. WITH THEIR UNDER RECALL CONDITIONS OR NOT THEY DO EVEN MORE SO IN A POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE BAR IS SO LOW. TO IN ORDER TO ALLOW A RECALL. AND WHEREAS A JUDGE A FEDERAL JUDGE CANNOT BE IMPEACHED FOR UNPOPULAR LEGAL RULINGS. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE SAME PROTECTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO A SITTING GOVERNOR. AND THAT PROTECTION SHOULD INCLUDE A COST ELEMENT FOR RECALL THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS TERRIFIC THANK YOU SENATOR STUDIO LET ME SEE IF COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS BEFORE WE LET YOU GO. COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS JERRY BERMAN IS CENTER STUDIO THE YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND IN PARTICULAR I LOVE THE- THE COST OF DISTRACTION IN THE COST OF AVOIDANCE- KIND OF POINTS THAT YOU MADE THAT. I'M KIND OF STRUGGLE TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE EXACTLY THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON ON GOVERNING AND THE GOVERNING PROCESS AND THE IMPACT OF THAT HAD. OVER THIS PAST NINE MONTHS AND YEAH I THINK YOU'RE SPOT ON AND SAYING THAT IT IMPACTED YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR IT ALSO IMPACTED THE LEGISLATURE- AND THAT'S NOT GOOD. FOR CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW ALSO APPRECIATE YOU AND- FORMER SENATOR NOW SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON'S POINTS KIND OF ABOUT. WHAT SHOULD WE USE RECALL FOR VERSUS WHAT SHOULD BE THE POINT OF REELECTION CAMPAIGNS- IN YOU KNOW ELECTION CAMPAIGNS. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE SHOULD BE FOR DISAGREEMENTS IN POLICY- AND THAT'S THE AT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE PUBLIC HAS TO. SAY WE DISAGREE WITH THE POLICIES THAT YOU ENACTED WE DISAGREE WITH THE POLICIES. YOU SUPPORTED AND THEREFORE WE'RE GONNA VOTE YOU OUT OF OFFICE. VERSUS MAYBE IT SHOULD BE THIS HIGHER BAR FOR A RECALL. LIKE YOU SAID WITH WITH YOU KNOW SUCH AS SOME- YOU KNOW IT'S- SOMETHING THAT THAT THE. THE OTHER COURTS WOULD IDENTIFY IS AS- EXTRA MELFI- TO GET A RAISE TO THE- OF. WARRANTING RECALL- SO JUST JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR POINTS ON THAT AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE YOU. AGREED WITH YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW FORMER COLLEAGUE FROM THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AISLE. A ABOUT THAT- YOU CAN GO AHEAD. I WILL I AM VERY BIASED MY FAVORITE REPUBLICAN WAS ALWAYS CHRISTMAS HERE'S AN ENGINE YOU CAN NAME. BUT I MEAN YOU KNOW BROUGH SPEAKS THE TRUTH AND HE'S A SITTING EMBER OF AN ELECTED BODY RIGHT NOW AND HE SPEAKS THE TRUTH WHEN HE SAYS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A HIGHER BURDEN OF PROOF. AS TO WHAT TO RECALL OF OFFENSE AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATUTES THAT USE THE WORD MALFEASANCE GRANTED THE WORD IS CONFUSING THERE'S NOT REALLY CLEAR CUT DEFINITIONS FOR THAT BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE WHY DON'T YOU AK A QUESTION OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL COUNCIL. MADE UP OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND A LOT OF JUDGES UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND LET'S SEE IF THEY COULD COME UP WITH A DEFINITION TO THE WORD MALFEASANCE TO GUIDE YOU AS YOU GO THROUGH THESE THEM. THE JUSTICE SUGGESTED IDEAS THANK FOUNDER GREAT THANK YOU CHAIR BURKE BERMAN- LOOKING AT MY COLLEAGUES THEY SEE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. SENATOR STUDIO SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US WE APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL TESTIMONY CERTAINLY THE CONCRETE EXAMPLES YOU GAVE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. FOR THOSE KINDS A DEFINITION QUESTION. J. YOUR- THIS IS. ALL RIGHT OR THE FLORIDA ON JULY. GEORGIA I KNOW IF IT IS A DIFFERENCE OKAY. AND ANYWAY OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THANK YOU. SENATOR WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR IN. AND WITH US GOING FORWARD THANK YOU SO. OUR FINAL SPEAKER IN THIS FIRST PANEL IS FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER JIM COONEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CONVENE IS A PARTNER AT CALIFORNIA STRATEGIES A PUBLIC AFFAIRS CONSULTING FIRM- HE JOINED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO OVERSEE THE FIRM'S OFFICE AND SILICON VALLEY- THE REGION WHERE HE GREW UP AND LATER REPRESENTED IN THE LEGISLATURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KUNEEN. REPRESENTED THE TWENTY FOURTH DISTRICT IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY FROM NINETEEN NINETY FOUR TO TWO THOUSAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CLEANING WELCOME TO OUR JOINT HEARING. AND WE WELCOME YOUR TESTING NOW. YOUR NAME IS MY VOICE. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU FINE. CHAIRPERSON NOT A GLAZER AND BERMAN MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND BY A STEEP. FORMER COLLEAGUE CENTER SCHOOLS YEAH THAT SOME WOMEN NOW BUT FIRST THAT NOW SUPER. AT A GREAT ON AND I LEARNED SO MUCH LISTENING BOTH OF YOU AGAIN THINKING TO THOSE TIMES IN THINKING THAT. MAYBE THINGS ARE BETTER WHEN WE WERE IN CHARGE. IT YEAH- IDNR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THAT VOTERS HAVE A RIGHT TO RECALL- IS MERITORIOUS IN MY MIND AND- I WANT TO BE A STAR IMAGE DEFENDER OF THE RIGHT TO RECALL AS A TOOL FOR OUR CITIZENS. I WANT TO GIVE SOME CONTEXT ABOUT AS WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE IDEAS FROM BY WAY OF BACKGROUND I WAS ELECTED THREE TIMES TO THE LEGISLATURE UP. AND WAS THE NOMINEE OF MY POLITICAL PARTY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND VERY PROUD TO HAVE BEEN MANY YEARS AGO- FOR UNITED STATES CONGRESS THAT. I'M NO LONGER REPUBLICAN AND NEVER A DEMOCRAT BUT I. M. NATIONALLY AND INDEPENDENT I HAD A MEMBER OF THE NEW CALIFORNIA COMMONSENSE PARTY- BUT THE VIEWS I'M EXPRESSING TODAY- ARE MY OWN- AND NONE OF MY NEW CARD. IN OUR NATION ON IN OUR REPUBLIC OVERALL- PROMOTING STABLE GOVERNMENTS. WHILE PROTECTING MINORITY VOICES. THROUGH SUCH TOOLS AS SUPERMAJORITY VOTES JUDICIAL DECISIONS AND DON'T NECESSARILY REFLECT THE MAJORITY WILL IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT OR IN SOME STATES- RECALLING THE EXECUTIVE OR LEGISLATOR SEEMS TO BE PRAISED IN MY MIND. EACH OF HESE IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY- AND STABLE GOVERNANCE. SO FOR PURPOSES OF COMPARISON IN MY CASE SO SUPERMAJORITY VOTES THE CORE PRINCIPLE FOR ME ANYWAY IS THAT A FAIR MAJORITY VOTE. JUST ISN'T ENOUGH SOMETIMES. YES IT'S LEGITIMATE TO DEBATE. WHAT CONSTITUTES. NUMBER BOTH. ANY GIVE CERTAIN. IS IT TOO THIRDS IS IT 5% DIFFERENCE HAS BEEN IN ENACT IN SOME AREAS WHOPPERS THE NOTION- BACK MORE THAN A MAJORITY IS NECESSARY IN SOME CASES. COMING TO ON THE ISSUE OF THE RECALL THE MATTER IN HAND MODIFYING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF SUCH A DRAMATIC ACTION IS REQUIRED DISCUSSION. I'M NOT ADVOCATING READY IN THE RECALL NOR NARROWING THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF OUR TALK ABOUT- NERIMA FLORAL SO NARROW THAT NO RECALL CAN QUALIFY- BUT ENSURING PROPER USE WHEN NECESSARY. AND NOT WITH NEARLY- POSSIBLE BACKED UP WHETHER A PARTY OR A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS MAY RECALL- DOESN'T MEAN IT'S WISE TO DO SO. AND HERE'S WHY I BELIEVE RECALL EFFORT SIR A FRESH. VOTERS MORE IN MY MIND A CRUSHING. READ ELECTION JUST MONTHS GOING TO PRIMARY. WAS UNNECESSARILY DISRUPTIVE I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT POINT BASED ON MERIT POLICY DISAGREEMENTS AND COSTLY. AS I WROTE RECENTLY. I AM TWENTY A POLICY QUARRELS WITH GOVERNOR KNEW SOMETHING I DESPERATELY WISH SHE'D SUPPORT MORE WATER STORAGE LOWER TAXES REMOVE ON REASONABLE REGULATORY BURDENS STOP UNDERMINING PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. CEASE TRYING TO HINDER PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS JUST TO NAME A FEW. HOWEVER GOVERNOR NEWSOM CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR WITH POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM MY OWN ON THESE MATTERS AND ONE ELECTION BY A LANDSLIDE. EARS AGO. AT THE TIME OF THE RECALL HE WAS SCHEDULED TO STAND FOR RE ELECTION IN JUST A HANDFUL OF MONTHS. IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL FOR SOMEONE NEW TO FORM A GOVERNMENT. THOUSANDS OF APPOINTMENTS THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY DEVELOPMENT LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY AND RUN IN THE NEXT OPEN PRIMARY A FEW MONTHS LATER. CONSIDER THAT ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER HAD THREE YEARS TO DO SO. THERE ARE SO MANY IDEAS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION BY I LIKE TO MENTION JUST A FEW HERE ARE AND QUALIFY A FEW HERE- AND SOME OF OUR FILES TO BE SEMI PROCESSED AFTER ALL FOR LEGISLATORS- FIRST- I THINK ONE WAY TO CALIBRATE THIS TENSION BETWEEN- NOT WANTING TO MAKE. A BAR SO DIFFICULT IS TO CONSIDER RAISING THE SIGNATURES REQUIRED FOR QUALIFICATION. COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH DATA FROM THE STAFF REGARDING- THE PERCENT OF SIGNATURES REQUIRED FOR RECALL IN A MODEST HIGHER THRESHOLD- WOULD DEMAND GOING BEYOND MERE POLICY DIFFERENCES IN MY MIND. YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT TOO HIGH. BUT I THINK TODAY IT'S TOO LOW. SECOND I LIKE THE IDEA OF ELEVATING THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOLLOWING THE SUCCESSFUL RECALL TO AVOID THE CARTOONISH LIST OF DOZENS OF REPLACEMENTS. BECAUSE THEY GREATLY DIMINISHES. YES REFLECTION ON WHO SHOULD WIENER STATE. I THINK IT'S HARD TO CALIBRATE BUT I DON'T AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MULLIN- I'M A VERY THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATOR- ON SEPARATE OREGON RUNNING AS A TICKET I LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING SEPARATE EVEN IF IT IS AN OPPOSITE PARTY FOR SOME OF THE REASONS EVEN- SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON TO. ABOUT AND- DENNIS WILL TAKE MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE TO CALIBRATE RIGHT AND I JUST HEARD A CENTER STUDIO AND HER BRILLIANT LEGAL MIND BUT I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER- AND WE EVEN TALK ABOUT IT MUCH HERE LOOTING THE TIME FRAME FROM WHICH A RECALL PETITION CAN QUALIFY. A RECALL SO LATE IN THE GOVERNOR'S TERM DOES NOT PROMOTE STABLE GOVERNMENT BUT INSTEAD PROVED RATHER HAZARD IN THIS CASE THAT THE LIMITING A RECALL DOING HER MAYBE NOT JUST QUALIFY TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE REGULAR OPEN PRIMARY- A REGULAR ELECTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. I'M OPEN TO MANY OF THE OTHER IDEAS DISCUSSED AS WELL BUT I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE BY SAYING I'M A FRUSTRATED- INDEPENDENT DROPPED FROM MY OWN CENTER. RIGHT PERSPECTIVE- I TELL YOU WHAT WE STILL GOT AND I WILL TO. FIND THE RIGHT BALANCE I WON TO HAVE THE TO READ. AND I'M TO HAVE A TWO USED IN A CONCERT MAN- I DON'T I'M ALONE IN THAT- AND I THINK CAN DO ABOUT. SO WITHOUT OKAY INCLUDING HOW THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY'D LIKE TO I'VE BEEN. TERRIFIC THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. J. YEARS AFTER. AGUIAR-CURRY HAS FOLLOWED QUEST. IS THANKS SO MUCH IN A COMMUNAL IS A GREAT TO SEE YOU I'VE GOT A QUESTION I'M COMPANY ON THE SPOT SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- BUT THIS ONE THERE'S ANOTHER KIND OF PART OF THE PROCESS WHICH IS. THE- THE- KIND OF ITS SIGNATURES THAT NEED TO BE COLLECTED OR OR OR THE- IT PROCESS JUST TO PULL PAPERS. JUST IT TO START THE RECALL PROCESS AND I KNOW I'VE- SPOKEN WITH SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED TO SAY. YOU KNOW ALL IT HAS TO HAPPEN I THINK IT'S- FOR THE GOVERNOR IT'S- TWENTY SIGNATURES SIXTY FIVE SIXTY. SO DID TO START A RECALL PROCESS FOR RECALLING THE GOVERNOR. YOU JUST NEED TO SUBMIT SIXTY FIVE SIGNATURES- AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I CAN BE AS LITTLE AS TEN SIGNATURES- TO START A RECALL PROCESS. WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY SHOW A REAL BRIGHT THIRD DEPTH OF SUPPORT FOR THAT RECALL. AND WOULD YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW EVEN BEFORE THE SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY AND PUT ON THE BALLOT. IS THE SIGNATURES TO JUST START THAT PROCESS SIMPLE PAPERS. DO YOU THINK THAT'S AN AREA THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS WELL- AS AS A AREA FOR POSSIBLE. REFORM OF THE RECALL PROCESS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE LOOKED AT IN YOUR- LEGISLATORS. YOU KNOW SO YOU REALLY WANT TO HAVE. USED TO BIGELOW BERMAN. I'M AND IS IT. TOO EASY NOW ON- YOU KNOW OUR PASSIONS ARE NOT IN CHECK IN SO WE CALL THOSE PAPERS AND HAVE SO FEW SIGNATURES- NUMBER- OF WHAT IT SHOULD REQUIRE BUT- UP- I DO THINK IN THE INSTANCE IT IS FEELS TO- AS WELL RIGHT NOW. BUT I DO THINK THAT A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE SOMETIMES CAN TAP INTO A LARGER MOMENT- SO I WOULD NOT ACT- SUPPORT- MAKING THAT BURDEN SO CRUSHING. MAKES SENSE IN A SENSE IT'S. A VERY GOOD OTHER QUESTIONS FROM NOT MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT A C. NINE AS MEMBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR VERY TESTIMONY THINGS YOU THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER RAISING THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT- SO IT GOES BEYOND A MERE POLICY DIFFERENCES- YOUR SUPPORT FOR ELEVATING LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS ONE ALTERNATIVE- LIMITING THE TIME FRAME FOR RECALL TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO A PRIMARY ALL THOSE THINGS UP SERIOUS MINDED. AND THOUGHTFUL AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT TO OUR DELIBERATIONS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CHAIR BERMAN. THANK YOU THEATER GLAZER- SO. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PORTION OF% THE AGENDA WE WILL HEAR ABOUT RECALL PROCEDURES IN OTHER STATES- AND THIS WAS ALLUDED TO BY SOME OF THE AB PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT WE JUST HEARD JOINING US FOR THIS PART OF THE AGENDA IS BEN WILLIAMS A PROGRAM PRINCIPLE IN THE ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING PROGRAM AT THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATORS- STATE LEGISLATURES. ALONG WITH THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR HE MANAGES AND CSL IS REDISTRICTING AND STATE PARTISAN COMPOSITION AT PORTFOLIOS- NOW AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MR WILLIAMS HAS A POWER POINT PRESENTATION- FOR US- IF WE CAN GET THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION UP ON THE SCREEN. I WILL WAIT A SECOND FOR THAT TO HAPPEN- AND THEN MISTER WILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR JONING US. AND YOU MAY BEGIN AS SOON AS THE POWER POINT IS READY AND IT'S UP. SO WE ARE READY FOR YOU MISTER WILLIAMS. I WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIRMANSHIP GLAZER MEMBERS BEFORE ADDING IT TODAY I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT NOT RECALL. PROCEDURES THAT EXIST NATIONWIDE A LOT OF THIS WAS COVERED IN THE- VICTORY GO THE NUMBER THAT WAS WRITTEN BY YOUR STAFF- AND- LEADING UP INTO THIS HEARING SO SOME OF THIS MAY. NOT BE NEW A LOT OF A STRONG TOMORROW RESOURCES AS WELL- BUT IT'S HELPFUL I MEAN JUST LOOK AT IT THROUGH A- STEP BY STEP TO SEE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT IS ON TRACK. NATION ON RECALL ELECTIONS TO PUT CALIFORNIA. IN JUST WHERE CALIFORNIANS SIMILAR TO ITS PEERS AND WHERE IT'S DIFFERENT. SO THE FIRST POINT I WANTED TO MAKE WAS THAT IT'S ALL IT'S A BIPARTISAN ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE NEEDS OF ALL STATE LEGISLATORS NATIONWIDE ALL SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE LEGISLATORS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE MEMBERS OF THE NCSL AS ARE ALL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PLUS LEGISLATIVE STAFF. THAT'S A BIG GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF DIVERSE POLITICAL OPINIONS AND THAT'S RECALL NCSL RECOMMENDATIONS ON POLICY SO YOU WANT YOUR BEATS IT'S SAYING THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOT COULD NOT. ANY PARTICULAR PROCEDURE OR PRACTICE WHAT I WILL DO IS LET OUT INFORMATION AS IT EXISTS NATIONWIDE SO THAT YOU WILL BE BETTER INFORMED FOR THE DECISIONS THAT YOU WILL BE PICKING. AS. YOU CONTINUE ON THIS PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. SO THE FIRST POINT IS UP DOESN'T TAKE FROM IT RECALLS A STATE IF AT ALL. AND IN THIS CASE TWENTY IS AND MIGHT BE IN THAT IT DOES RECALLS. THERE ARE NINETEEN STATES THAT PREVENT RECALL ELECTIONS. US THE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT THE TERMINOLOGY VERY STATE STATE YOU GET THE IDEA. IF YOU CAN'T AGREE STATES ON THE SLIDE YOU'LL NOTICE TWENTY STATES HIGHLIGHTED NOT NINETEEN AND THAT'S BECAUSE- UP FOR NEXT WEEK A CROSS I RECALL PROCESS SO IN VIRGINIA. AND THERE'S A SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT AS EXIST IN THE OTHER RECALL STATES BUT IF ENOUGH SIGNATURES ARE GATHERED TO TRIGGER THE RECALL THE RECALL PROCEDURE IS A JUDICIAL TRIAL. NOT AN ELECTION IN A TRIAL WAS HELD TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ONE OF THE PRE DETERMINED BECAUSE IT'S LAID OUT OF VIRGINIA STATE LAW EXIST. FOR AN EIGHT OFFICER OF THE STATE TO BE REMOTE. SO THAT IS ONE UNIQUE EXAMPLE. BUT YOU'LL NOTICE AS I GO THROUGH THE REST OF PRESENTATION. REFERENCE NINETEEN STATES NOT TWENTY. SO THE FOR ISSUES THAT NCSL TRACKS OFF FOR RECALLS ARE THE REASON. SO CAN IT BE FOR ANY REASON OR TO SAY BECAUSE NECESSARY TO. TRIGGER A RECALL ELECTION THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THE SIGNATURES HOW MANY ARE NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. THE GATHERING HOW LONG IS THE SIGNATURE GATHERING BOB BY WHICH TIME ABOUT THE PETITION GATHERS NEED TO SUBMIT THOSE SIGNATURES FOR THE STATE FOUR. OPERABLE OR REJECTION. AND THEN THE REPLACEMENT NAKED. HOW IS THE REPLACEMENT SELECTED YES THE MEASURE DOES QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. SO THE FIRST OF THOSE FOR. US IS A RECALLS ARE PERMITTED CALIFORNIA IS IN THE JORDY POSITION. MAKES A RECALL FOR ANY REASON THERE ARE TWELVE STATES THAT PERMIT A RECALL FOR ANY REASON E. EIGHTY STATES THAT. ONLY REQUIRED FOR CALLS ONE OF THOSE IS VIRGINIA JUST ALL STATE NOTAN ACTUAL ELECTION SO THERE ARE ONLY SEVEN STATES THAT REQUIRE A CLAUSE FOR A RECALL ELECTION- TO BE HELD. IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS WHICH IS NEEDED TO TRIGGER RECALL CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST PERMITS STATES IN THE COUNTRY THERE'S ONLY ONE STATE MONTANA NEVER IS A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT ALL OF THE OTHER STATES HAVE A FIRE ALTERCATION HOWEVER I WILL NOTE THAT MONTANA IN CALIFORNIA DO DIFFER ON ONE KEY POINT WHICH IS THAT MONTANA. ALL THE PERCENTAGE WHICH IS 10% CALIFORNIA'S 12% MONTANA'S 10% OF REGISTERED VOTERS WORST CALIFORNIA'S 12% OF THE NUMBER OF VOTES CAST FOR THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE IN THE MOST RECENT ELECTION SO YOU COULD SEE A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST SIGNATURE PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD. IN THE COUNTRY. AND HERE'S ANOTHER SLIDE TO LAY OUT WHAT THOSE STATES ARE- CALIFORNIA SO YOU CAN SEE EXAMPLES ADEQUATE FOR THE SLACK IS THE LOWEST. AND THEN THE MAJORITY OF STATES HAVE A 25% OR GREATER SPECIALTY MOST OF THE STATES IN THAT CATEGORY ARE AT 25% BUT THERE ARE A FEW THAT HAVE. SPECIAL TO ELEVATE IT BEYOND THAT I WILL NOTE THAT A LOT OF THINGS TO HAVE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS FOR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICES ROB THIS PRESENTATION I'M REFERRING ONLY TO STATEWIDE OFFICES. THERE'S A RAGING FACTOR IS THE LENGTH OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER. AGAIN CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST PERMISSIVE STATES IN THE COUNTRY ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT AS EXTREME AS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S A RECALL. ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DATE OTHER ONLY THREE THAT HAVE LONG WINDOWS THOSE ARE LOUISIANA HEARD IN EIGHTY DAYS NEW JERSEY THREE HUNDRED TWENTY TO ONE SIXTY DEPENDING ON THE OFFICE AND WASHINGTON STATE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY OR ONE HUNDRED AND HE TAKES. A DEPENDING ON THE OFFICE EVERYONE ELSE IS SHORTER YOU WILL SEE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN ALASKA AND WHAT'S IT CODE DO NOT SPECIFY THE LENGTH OF THE PERIOD AND LOSS THAT'S DECIDED TO- AT THE MOMENT OF THE RECALL HELLO THAT. WILL BE. AND SO YOU CAN SEE IT AGAIN BROKE INTO THE START OF THE MAJORITY OF STATES EITHER STAY UP TO NINETY DAYS FOR THREE MONTHS OCT TENTH OCTOBER TENTH. NOT TO THE NUMBER OF DAYS. FOR EASE OF ALL ITS INFORMATION ONCE LINE A COMBINED THIS KIND OF WORKS. ANOTHER ONLY TWO STATES THAT HAVE EIGHT INTERMEDIATE LENGTH OF TIME ARIZONA AND WHATNOT. SO THE LAST CATEGORY IS OUR THE RECALL CANDIDATE IS REPLACED AND YOU CAN SEE HERE IS MORE EVEN SPLIT BETWEEN THE STATE'S CALVET IT IS IN THE FIRST CATEGORY WHERE THE RECALL AND REPLACEMENT ELECTIONS ARE HELD SIMULTANEOUSLY. SECOND CATEGORY WHERE THERE'S A SPECIAL ELECTION AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL RECALL TO APPOINT THE SUCCESSOR SO WE HAVE TWO SEPARATE ELECTIONS THAT OCCUR AND THEN AND THERE IN FIVE STATES THE SUCCESSOR. SUCCESSOR IS NOT. ON ELECTED BY PEOPLE OF THE STATE- A COUPLE OF INTERESTING CARRY OUT YOUR CALIFORNIA COLORADO THE ONLY STATE THAT I HAVE THE ELECTION- SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH TWO SEPARATE. QUESTIONS ANY OTHER STATES. THE WAIT I'D BE EASIEST WAY FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT. THE SUCCESS OF THE MISSION OF THE RECALL PETITION ACTS AS THE RECALL ITSELF THAT'S SIMPLE TO CALIFORNIA'S FIRST QUESTION RIGHT THE OFFICER IS FUNCTIONALLY RECALL THAT. THE DIFFERENCE IS THE RECALL OFFICERS PERMITTED TO RUN REPLACEMENT BALLOTS SO THEY CAN ESSENTIALLY BE REELECTED BACK INTO THE OFFICE THAT THEY HELL DON'T REMOVED DURING THAT. PERIOD SO IT'S NOT EXACT SAME THE SAME THE RECALL BUT FOR PURPOSES OF CONCEPTUALIZING ACTION PROCESS. THAT'S THE BEST ANALOGY I CAN GIVE TO CALIFORNIA. I IN FOR THOSE FIVE STATES THAT ARE IN CALIFORNIA'S CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT CALIFORNIA COLORADO. THE CURRENT OFFICE HOLDERS AUTOMATICALLY PLACED ON THE BALLOT UNLESS THEY RESIGN FROM OFFICE SO THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC MECHANISM FOR PUTTING THE MECCA ONLY NEVADA. REQUIRES THE CURRENT OFFICE HOLDER TO ACTUALLY SIGN BACK ON. TO GET ON TO THE PLACE OUT. JUST A FINAL TO. THAT I THINK ARE INTERESTING OF THE THREE STATES. THAT THREE OF THE FIVE STATES THAT HAVE THE- APPOINTED REPLACEMENT IDAHO KANSAS AND WASHINGTON REQUIRED AT THEIR PLACE TO BE FROM THE SAME POLITICAL ARE USED TO BE CALLED CANADA. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR SELECTING THAT PERSON SOMETIMES IT'S- THE STATE SECOND COMMITTEE OF THE PARTY SUBMITS NAMES AND THAT'S CHOSEN SOMETIMES IT. OUT SOMEONE ELSE IN THE PARKING. A SOME OTHER STATE ELECTED OFFICER WHO WAS OF THE SAME PARTY BUT THEY HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME POLITICAL PARTY. AND IN CALIFORNIA GEORGIA LOUISIANA MONTANA AND WASHINGTON ARE UP TO FIVE STATES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT SIGNATURE THRESHOLDS FOR DIFFERENT OFFICES SO YOU MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT SIGNATURE THRESHOLD- AND SOME OF THE STATE'S FOR. US SENATE OR FOR GOVERNOR THAT HE WOULD FOR ME SECRETARY OF STATE TREASURER. DIFFERENT. STATEWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICES. AND WITH THAT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER WILLIAMS REALLY APPRECIATE- THAT THAT VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO FOLLOW PRESENTATION. ONE OPEN UP THAT TO COLLEAGUES SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS PRESSURES THE ART OF QUESTION. SIR MY QUESTION BET MISTER WILLIAMS MY OTHER QUESTION IS ON YOUR SLIDE ABOUT THE LENGTH OF SIGNATURE GATHERING PERIOD BY STATE. DID YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THERE IS A- VERY. A AN EFFORT THAT HAS TO BE PUT TOGETHER TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT SIGNATURES IN CALIFORNIA HAS A HUGE POPULATION. AND SO RIGHT NOW AT LEAST I THINK THE LAST ELECTION THERE THIS THIS PREVIOUS ELECTION IT WAS ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SIGNATURES THEY HAD COLLECTED WHEREAS SAY MONTANA. PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THAT MANY AND IT WOULD TAKE THEM A LOT LESS TIME AND THAT MAY BE WHY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE DO YOU THINK THAT DIFFERENCE. IS CORRELATED TO THE POPULATION THE DIFFICULTY IT WOULD TAKE TO BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET THOSE OBTAINED OBTAIN SIGNATURES TO HAVE A- GET IT. THAT RECALL ON THE BALLOT. NOT SURE CERTAIN I EXCITED THAT I SHOULD DID NOT CONTROL FOR POPULATION DIFFERENCES SO IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT THERE CAN BE REASONS TO COMMITTED BY LEGISLATORS FOR THE LENGTH OF THEIR TIMELINES I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY BEHIND WHY CALIFORNIA SELECT X. WHEN DID IT YEAH- SO I DON'T WANT TO COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT WHAT YOU SAID IS TRUE IT DEFINITELY SEEMS REASONABLE TO ME. I UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS MAYBE THOSE LONGER TIME PERIODS ARE BECAUSE OF THE POPULATION DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT COLORADO IDAHO KANSAS MONTANA COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE MORE THAN ALSO PUT TOGETHER SO- SO ANYWAY. AT THAT CLARIFICATION. FOR THE YOU'RE GLAZER YEAH- MISTER WILLIAMS THANK YOU FOR AGAIN YEARS TO SANCTION AND CLEAR TESTIMONY SOMETIMES I WORRY WE AVOID THE OBVIOUS IN THESE KINDS THE DEBATE SO I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION THAT- MAY BE OBVIOUS TO SOME OF US BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE YOUR CLARIFICATION IT WILL JUST WANT TO RECALL THE ATMOSPHERICS OF IT ALL WAS THAT IT WAS A PARTISAN ISSUE ONE PARTY WAS NOT HAPPY ANOTHER PARTY WAS IN POWER- AND YOU BROKE DOWN THE STATE'S THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE ANY RECALL. AND THOSE THAT DO IS THERE ANY KIND OF PARTISAN- BREAK IN AND THAT DATA THAT WOULD SUGGEST TO YOU THAT ONE PARTY OR THE OTHER I FELT THAT IT WAS A MORE IMPORTANT ARE DOMINATING OPTION. THAN THE OTHER. CHECK JUST TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THAT SLIDE AGAIN THAT'S A AYE WILL THAT WAS. NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M AT. THROUGH THAT LENS COMING INTO THIS- THE ONE THING THAT ARE STAND OUT TO ME VERY CLEARLY IS THAT THE- US STATES THAT PERMITS THE RECALL. SO TO BE THE STATE'S THAT ALSO PERMITS CITIZENS INITIATIVES OUT MEASURES THAT HAVE MORE DIRECT DEMOCRACY MECHANISMS THAT OTHERS THAT HAS A WESTERN BIAS. TO BE MORE STATES IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES THAT PROCEDURE SO I'M SEEING THAT TRAIN ON THE MAP THAT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL. I'M LOOKING AT MY SCREEN JUST. ANALYZE IT D. R. SEVERAL STATES THAT HAVE. NOT DEMOCRATIC CONTROL BUT THERE. ARE SEVERAL THAT HAVE REPUBLICAN CONTROLS WELL. TEN OUT NORTH. SCOTT SAID. WELL WE SEE AND I CAN. SO THERE THERE'S A IT'S A PRETTY EVEN. IN TERMS OF HEAT RECALL ELECTIONS THEMSELVES SO THERE'S A PRICE THAT ELECTIONS ARE PARTISAN AND THAT ELECTIONS- INFLAMED PARTISAN EMOTIONS. IT'S THE. THE JOB OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. YOU KNOW SEVEN ELECTION PROCEDURES TO MAKE THEIR RUN ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURES THAT ARE SET IN PLACE AT THAT TIME AND SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I LOVE COMING TO TESTIFY. LIKE YOU IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I GET TO SEE THAT WORK OF ELECTION ADMINISTRATION ELECTION MANAGEMENT. BUT THANK YOU AND BUT LOOKING AT IT FROM A PARTISAN POINT OF VIEW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE WHO DON'T PERMIT A RECALL. AND YOU SEE ON THE SAME PAGE TEXAS. WITH NEW YORK. AND MISSISSIPPI AND FLORIDA. AND OHIO THAT'S WHAT THEY DOESN'T COME ACROSS AS A PARTISAN SPLIT DOES IT TO YOU. NO NO NOT PARTICULARLY I MEAN. IT'S AT LEAST NOT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF THESE LOSSES DR DECADES DECADES AGO SO THE. NOW BUT AS I LOOK AT THIS NOW IT DOESN'T STRIKE ME THAT ALL THE STATES ARE OF ONE PARTY IN ALL THE STATES THAT DON'T PERMIT RECALLS ARE OF THE OTHER PARTY GREAT AND FINALLY SEEMS LIKE A RELATIVELY MIXED UP BACK IN EXACTLY EXACTLY AND FINALLY OF THOSE THAT DO ALLOW RECALL WHICH AGAIN YOU'RE COMBINING LOOKING AT NORTH DAKOTA AND MONTANA ALONG WITH ARIZONA IN CALIFORNIA ONCE AGAIN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A PARTISAN SPLIT IN TERMS OF DOMINANCE BY ONE PARTY THE OTHER IN TERMS OF HOW. AND WHAT THEY ALLOW IN THEIR STATE. YEAH I AM I. WOULDN'T TAKE ANY ON BRIDGE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT GOOD THANK YOU SIR. FRAZIER GLAZER- VESTER NELSON OUT OF YOU. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS RAIMES SO I DID MISS RAIMES THANK YOU AT YEAH I'VE I REALLY APPRECIATED THIS PRESENTATION AND THE SLIDE DECK AND I ASSUME WE'LL MAKE THIS. AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE FOR THE PUBLIC. I THINK IT REALLY STARKLY SHOWS HOW MUCH OF AN OUT LIAR CALIFORNIA IS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR RECALL PROCESS SEES- AND I THINK IT THE BAR GRAPHS. THAT YOU PROVIDED REALLY STARKLY ILLUSTRATE HOW MUCH OF AN OUT LIAR CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW THE BAR GRAPH ON ON PAGE SIX OF THE SLIDE DECK. WHERE WE SEE THAT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW THERE'S ONE OTHER STATE THAT THAT. HAS A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF SIGNATURES NOT NECESSARY BUT THAT STATE IT'S A PERCENTAGE OF. REGISTERED VOTERS NOT A PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTER TURNOUT FROM THE PRIOR GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION- AND THEN IF THAT'S MONTANA. AND THEN WE SEE. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE LONGEST PERIODS TO COLLECT THE SIGNATURES SO WE'VE GOT. THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF SIGNATURES THAT YOU NEED TO COLLECT. THE LONGEST ONE OF THE LONGEST TIMES TO COLLECT THE SIGNATURES. THAT WAS CURIOUS OR MONTANA YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'VE GOT A LOT LOWER SIGNATURE THRESHOLDS- DEPENDING ON ON THE ELECTION AND THE YEAR. BUT THEY ONLY ALLOW UP TO NINETY DAYS. TO COLLECT THOSE SIGNATURES WILL CALIFORNIA ALLOWS ALMOST TWICE THAT AMOUNT OF TIME A HUNDRED AND SIXTY DAYS SO. YOU KNOW IT JUST CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THERE IS A BROAD RANGE. OF PROCESS THESE THERE'S A BROAD RANGE OF- THRESHOLDS AND TIME TO MEET THOSE THRESHOLDS. IN THAT CALIFORNIA IS AWAY ON THE LOW END ON ONE AND WAY ON THE HIGHWAY AND ON ANOTHER. AND THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY- TO YOU KNOW TWEAK THINGS TO MAYBE MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE APPROPRIATE. AND MAKE IT MORE ALIGNED WITH A MAJORITY OF TE STATES THAT EVEN HAVE A RECALL PROCESS. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S A MINORITY OF STATES THAT EVEN HAVE A RECALL PROCESS NOW YOU'RE ONLY NINETEEN STATES- OR TWENTY IF YOU INCLUDE VIRGINIA WHICH IS A DIFFERENT MODEL SO. YOU DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU LAY THIS OUT AND I ENJOYED THE REASON SIGNATURE GATHERING REPLACEMENT I MEAN THAT REALLY HELPS KIND OF PINPOINT. THE FOUR AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. BE DISCUSSING. YOUR POSSIBLE REFORMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- SO NOT A QUESTION THERE REALLY JUST A COMMENT- BUT APPRECIATE THE WAY YOU LAY THIS OUT I THINK IT'S REALLY HELPFUL FOR US. AS WE EVALUATE HOW WE- STACK UP AGAINST OTHER STATES PROCESSES- AND WITH THAT. I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER THANK YOU MISTER WILLIAMS REALLY APPRECIATE IT. AT TWENTY SEVEN THANKS YOUR BROWSER I THANK EACH YEAR BERMAN WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR PANEL NUMBER THREE. THE QUESTION BEING PUT FORWARD TO THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD TO QUALIFY A RECALL AND THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THOSE SIGNATURES BE CHANGED. I WANT TO WELCOME TO OF THE OUR SPEAKERS PROFESSOR DAVE CARILLO WHO WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST FOLLOWED BY HOOVER INSTITUTE FELLOW BILL WHALEN- AND SINCE WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL. I'M GONNA SUGGEST THAT WE SAVE OUR MEMBER QUESTIONS UNTIL BOTH HAVE FINISHED THEIR TESTIMONY. FIRST WILL BEGIN WITH PROFESSOR CARILLO- PROFESSOR CORREOS A LECTURE IN RESIDENTS AN EXECUTOR RECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION CENTER. AT BERKELEY LAW SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE CO AUTHOR OF THE CASEBOOK CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. BEFORE JOINING THE ACADEMY DR CARILLO PRACTICE LAW FOR SIXTEEN YEARS. MOST RECENTLY AS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HE HAS SERVED ON SEVERAL STATE AND LOCAL COMMISSIONS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA LAW REVISION COMMISSION. THE JUDICIAL NOMINEES EVALUATION COMMISSION AND THE COMMITTEE OF BAR EXAMINERS PROFESSOR CARILLO WELCOME TO THE JOINT HEARING AND WE- WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU HAS MY AUDIO. TERRIFIC GREAT MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE MY NAME'S DAVID CARILLO DURING MY ACADEMIC CAPACITY TO DISCUSS THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT AND TIME TO GATHER FOR QUALIFYING STATE OFFICER RECALLS AGAIN A MOMENT REMARKS TO STATE OFFICER RECALLS NOT LOCAL OFFICE RECALLS IN THIS ANSWER EXCLUDES MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE SUCH AS YOURSELVES. SO THESE ISSUES THE SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT THE TIME TOGETHER THE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN DOES DIRECTLY AFFECT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CLARIFY RECALL. CHANGING JUST ONE OF THOSE FACTORS WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE THE DIFFICULTY MORE SIGNATURES ARE HARDER TO GATHER. GATHERING THE SAME NUMBER OF SIGNATURES AND SHORTER TIME SMARTER EITHER INCREASING THE NUMBER WILL SHORTEN THE TIME CAN BE MORE COSTLY. CHANGING BOTH THE NUMBER AND THE TIME IN THE SAME MANNER MAGNIFIES THE EFFECT FEWER SIGNATURES WITH LONGER TO GATHER AS MUCH EASIER. MORE SIGNATURES IN A SHORTER TIME. IS VASTLY MORE DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE. BROWN'S IN OPPOSITE WAY. COMMUTER KANSEN CHU AFFECT PERMITS MATCHING THESE IN DIFFICULT. SO GREATLY INCREASING THE SIGNATURES MODESTLY INCREASING THE TIME TO GATHER RESULTS IN A SMALLER OVER AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY. FIRST OF A SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES OF HIGHER SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT IT DIRECTLY TRANSLATES TO INCREASED COST. IT WAS LIKE A PRESS PER SENATE-ROOM WAS BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN DOLLARS FOR THE SEVEN DOLLAR AVERAGE FOR EXAMPLE TO CALIFORNIA MISSION IS THAT LIKE THE RECALL ALSO RECEIVED EXTENSIONS. BUT IT'S REPORTED COSTA BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE. THAT'S VERY EXPENSIVE THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE QUICKLY PROPONENTS NEEDED ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION SIGNATURES ND ACTUALLY SUBMITTED ABOUT TWO POINT ONE MILLION AT SEVEN DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE THAT'S FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S NO QUESTION A QUALIFYING COST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ABOVE WOULD BEAR SMALL CITIZEN ACTION GROUPS REALLY. ANYONE WITHOUT WHAT WEALTHY BACKERS. BOTTLING A REASON SURGERY. IS LOOKING TO SOMETHING SIX. AND MAKE IT PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. THE COST REALITY AFFECTS HOW WE SHOULD VIEW CALIFORNIA RELATION TO OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA SEEMS LIKE IT HAS THE LITTLE SIGNATURE PERCENTAGE OF 12% THAT IS MY CALLING JUST EXPLAINED MONTANA HAS ACTUALLY WAS PERCENTAGE. AND BECAUSE IT IS THE LARGEST OF OUR POPULATION CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST WIENER SIGNATURES NUMBER REGARDLESS OF THE QUALIFYING RULES TIED TO ELIGILE VOTERS REGISTERED VOTERS WERE TURNED OUT. WE WERE ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE POPULATION OF EITHER OF THE NEXT LARGEST RECALL STATES BUTCHER ILLINOIS IN GEORGIA. VIEW AS A PERCENT OF POP. CALIFORNIA LOOKS LIKE IT HAS THE LOWEST SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT REGARDLESS OF THE QUALIFYING RULE. HI WITH MONTANA FISH BY ELIGIBLE VOTERS WOULD USE A PERCENT OF POPULATION IS POTENTIALLY MISLEADING BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS THE LARGEST INELIGIBLE POPULATION AND THE LOWEST ELIGIBLE AS PERCENT OF POPULATION. JUST SIXTY FIVE POINT 7% OF CALIFORNIANS ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. IN CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS BY FR THE LARGEST AFTER DEVIATION FROM THE MEDIAN REAL SIGNATURE NUMBER REGARDLESS OF THE WILL OF THE RULE. MEMBERS OF OUR TRIP AND BEDIENT IF IT'S BY. VOTERS IN THE NEW TRIPLES BY. OR BY TWO. MOVING CALIFORNIA CHAU CLOSE TO THE AS A PERCENT OF POPULATION WOULD REQUIRE DOUBLING THE CURRENT SIGNATURE REQUIREMENT DOING SO WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA DEVIATE KINGDOM FEATHER UPWARD FROM THE MEDIAN REAL NUMBER. FOR EXAMPLE INCOME THE PERCENT OF TURNOUT. WHICH IS THE LOWEST DENOMINATOR TRANSLATES TO HUGE COST INCREASES. 20% OF TURNOUT IS ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION SIGNATURES AT SEVEN DOLLARS PER SIGNATURE THAT'S TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. POINT THREE MILLION SIGNATURES AT SEVEN DOLLARS PER THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A FEW YEARS TURNOUT WHICH AGAIN IS THE LOWEST OF THE DENOMINATORS. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FIRST FOR DIFFERENT REGISTRATIONS THE MARKET BECAUSE IT'S LESS VARIABLE THAN TURNOUT SO SPECIAL TO REGISTER DOES HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES BUT A PRODUCES ONLY MINOR FACTS. TURNOUT IS GENERALLY A LOWER NUMBER SUBSCRIPTION TO REGISTER ROOM INCREASE THE SIGNATURE NUMBER BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY. 20% OF REGISTERED VOTERS IS ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND MORE SENATORS AND SEVEN BASS PRO THAT START ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. 25% OF REGISTERED IS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND MORE SIGNATURES AGAIN IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS PER BUT STILL ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SO SWITCHING TO REGISTER FROM TURNOUT IS THE MARKER HAS ONLY MINOR EFFECTS OF SLAVERY INCREASING DIFFICULTY IN REDUCING VARIATION SOMEWHAT. SO IT'S NOT MUCH OF A REFORM. THAT'S THE SIGNATURE. THE ANALYSIS GAS TIME IS. COMPRESSOR INCREASED DIFFICULTY AND RAISE COSTS EXPANDING TO. MAKE IT EASIER AND CAN LOWER COSTS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE TO CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF CHANGING BERMAN NUMBER AND THE TIME. IF YOU COMBINE INCREASING RESEARCHERS PRESSED COMPRESSING THE PERIOD PLUS INCREASING THE COST THAT IT WAS REQUESTED DIFFICULT TO QUALIFY THAT NONE EVER WILL. IT SEEMS UNNECESSARY TO PERMIT THE INITIATIVE THE REQUEST AND WILL BE USED MUCH LESS. MAKING IT HARDER TO USE HE RECALL COULD TAKE IT FROM A RARE BIRD TO AN EXTINCT SPECIES. MISTER WHITAKER FINALLY ISSUED OF WHICH IS LOWER SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS FAR FEWER RECALLS RATIFY. FROM NINETEEN TWELVE TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLY 19% OF THEIR TIME IN THE NATION IS QUALIFIED FOR THE BALLOT. STATE OFFICER REQUIRES QUALIFYING READ IN. THAT SAME TIME PERIOD QUESTION IS HOW DIFFERENT DO YOU TO MAKE A TO QUALIFY STATE ON. READ THE PRODUCT PRESS IS- CALIFORNIAN. TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO QUALIFY THEM. IN A HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS 94% OF ESTATE OFFICER RECALLS FAILED TO QUALIFY. FOR GOVERNOR SPECIFICALLY 96% FAILED. INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY AS WITH MORE SIGNATURES LAST TIME OR BOTH MR TO BE BACK IN FUTURE RECALLS WITH SINGLE DIGIT QUALIFYING RATES AND A HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS NECESSARY. GIVEN HERRERA CLOSER EVEN MODESTLY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY COULD MAKE REQUEST PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA. IN THAT CASE WE WILL BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES YOU WILL DISARM FUTURE DEMOCRATS WHO MIGHT NEED IT. FINALLY THE NEXT PANEL CONSIDER CHANGING REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE QUALIFYING PROCEDURE AND CHANGING THE ELECTION MODEL. THERE'S ISSUES POTENTIAL CHAIRMAN PROVE THE RECALL THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT MARIN MESSAGE IN WHICH SHE BETTER RESULTS THAN THE ISSUES I HAVE COVERED. BRIDGE WHERE THE BROKEN WRIST BREAKING THE RECALL. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY WE'RE GONNA GUYS I MET QUESTIONS AT THE END AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A- HARD STOP AT THREE SO I THINK WE'LL GET TO THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND SO IT HAS TO STE. STAY TUNED. NEXT UP WE HAVE BILL RATE WHALEN. HE IS A VIRGINIA HOBBS CARPENTER DISTINGUISHED POLICY FELLOW IN JOURNALISM AND A HOOVER INSTITUTION RESEARCH FELLOW SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. HE WRITES AND COMMENTS ON CAMPAIGNS ELECTIONS GOVERNANCE. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CALIFORNIA IN AMERICA'S POLITICAL LANDSCAPES. PRIOR TO JOINING THE HOOVER INSTITUTION MR WILL AND SERVED AS CHIEF SPEECH WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS. FOR FORMER GOVERNOR PETE WILSON. I ALSO AS A POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT FOR INSIGHT MAGAZINE AS A SPEECH WRITER FOR THE BUSH QUAYLE. REELECTION CAMPAIGN MR WHALEN WE WELCOME YOU TO OUR HEARING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME. WE HEAR YOU A LITTLE- LIGHTS AND WE DON'T SEE THERE YOU ARE WE SEE YOU WANT TO SPEAK UP AGAIN WE CAN MAKE SURE WE CAN HEAR YOU. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YEAH YEAH. OKAY GOOD. WELL THAK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU- LET ME JUST KIND OF QUICKLY JUMP THROUGH A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE. BECAUSE I KNOW TIME IS SHORT HERE- I WILL TO THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD QUESTION MYSELF. AND THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AT THE THRESHOLD DO YOU WANT TO CONSIDER MAYBE RAISING IT TO THE SAME 20% THRESHOLD THAT APPLIES TO. STATE SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND APPEALS COURT. JUDGES I KNOW THIS IS APPLES AND ORANGES BECAUSE YOU'RE TAKING A STATEWIDE OFFICE AND TREATED THE SAME AS A LOCAL REGIONAL OFFICE BUT- IF THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE MORE FOLKS POPULI THEN PERHAPS. YOU WANT TO CONSIDER THE HIGHER THRESHOLD I DID THE MATH BY THE WAY IF YOU RAISE 220% YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWO POINT FOUR NINE THREE. MILLION SIGNATURES WHICH MEANS THAT THE LAST RECALL WITH A FOLLOW SHOT ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND VOTES. OTHER OPTION IS TO. KEEP THE 12% THRESHOLD APPLIED TO REGISTERED VOTERS FROM WHICH IN ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION THE LAST TIME I CHECKED. THAT WOULD REQUIRE TWO POINT SIX MILLION SIGNATURES SO- AS DAVID MENTIONED YOU WERE PRETTY MUCH PUTTING THE RECALL PROCESS OUT OF THE BUSINESS IF YOU DO THOSE- I THINK A MUCH MORE PRACTICAL APPROACH HERE MIGHT BE ONE OF SIGNATURE GATHERING- AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY I APOLOGIZE IF I'M REPEATING ANYTHING I JUMPED ON THIS ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES AGO AND I. I MEASURE BROKEN GOING GOOD IN THE SAME THEMES MAYBE THAT'S GOOD. THANKS TO A SUGGEST CONSENSUS HERE. BOB CALIFORNIA WITH A HUNDRED SIXTY DAYS I WENT TO THE OTHER EIGHTEEN RECALL STATE SO. OBVIOUSLY NOBODY IS CALIFORNIA- BUT I DID FIND SPREE THAT HAVE ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION THAT'S. GEORGIA ILLINOIS MICHIGAN. YOUR REQUIRES NINETY DAY CIRCUIT- MICHIGAN NINETY DAYS ILLINOIS. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS. I WOULD NOT BE AVERSE TO THE IDEA OF TAKING THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY DAY WINDOW UNTIL. YOU GET DOWN TO LET STATE. ARGUMENT ONE TWENTY. WHY WOULD THAT BE BECAUSE I THINK CALIFORNIA DESPITE THE SIZE A LARGER POPULATION THE GREATER GEOGRAPHY. HAS THREE ADVANTAGES IS OTHER STATES DON'T NUMBER ONE WE HAVE WELL THE LAST WEEKEND- NOT INCLUDED. WE HAVE BETTER WEATHER THAN MOST OTHER STATES WE'RE NOT GONNA GET KNOCKED DOWN. FOR A WEEK BY SNOW STORM OR- OR HURRICANE- SO IT'S EASIER PHYSICALLY TO GET OUT AND COLLECT SIGNATURES. SECONDLY WE SHOULD HAVE BETTER TECHNOLOGY WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION IF WE WANT TO EXPLORE THE IDEA. OF DOING A SIGNATURE GATHERING ONLINE FOR RECALLS. AND THEN THIRDLY WE ALREADY HAVE A BUILT IN PROCESS OF INITIATIVES WE HAVE A VIBRANT SIGNATURE GATHERING AT A STREET IN. THE STATE- AS FOR UP NOW I WANT TO TAKE YOU QUICKLY TO AREAS I'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS HERE ONE. IS I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE GROUNDS FOR RECALL AND HERE I WOULD JOB. CONSIDER THIS BOB WE WANT TO MAKE A RECALL VOTE SIMPLY A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE. WE WANT TO MAKE A RECALL VOTE A CHANCE TO RELITIGATE THE PAST LEFT AND WE WANT TO MAKE RECALL SOMETHING THAT A- LITTLE BIT TO. THE PUBLIC'S IMPEACHING OF AN OFFICER IF SO THEN THE QUESTION OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PIECE GOT WHICH IS HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS FOR PRESIDENT. I HOPE WE DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD WITH THAT TERM THAT'S A TERRIBLE TERM HE WAS I THINK SO MUCH OPEN SPECULATION ON THAT. I WOULD REFER YOU TO GEORGIA. WHICH HAS A VERY SPECIFIC- FRAMEWORK FOR RECALL HERE'S WHAT. IT SAYS AND I'M READY TO VERBATIM QUOTE. I RECALL WAS TRIGGERED BY QUOTE AN ACT MELFI. OR MISCONDUCT. OFFICE VIOLATION OF THE OATH OF OFFICE FAILURE TO PERFORM DUTIES PRESCRIBED BY LAW OR WILLFULLY MISUSING CONVERTING ARE MISAPPROPRIATING. WITHOUT AUTHORITY PUBLIC PROPERTY OR PUBLIC FUNDS ENTRUSTED TO ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTIVE OFFICE. TO WHICH THE OFFICIAL HAS BEEN ELECTED OR APPOINTED. IN OTHER WORDS THIS- POINTS MORE TO ACTS IN OFFICE MORE THAN JUST I DON'T LIKE THE WAY THE GOVERNOR LOOKS I JUST DON'T LIKE THE PARTY HERE SHE BELONGS TO. AND PERHAPS YOU ALSO WANT TO CONSIDER CREATING A YOU KNOW A PANEL OF RETIRED JUDGES TO VET THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. RECALL EFFORT NUMBER TWO IF YOU HAVE TO. EXPLAIN WHY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE RECALLED THEN PERHAPS A BODY INDEPENDENT BODY SHOULD REVIEW WHETHER NOT IS GOING TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL AS IT BIGELOW JUDGE ANYWAY. AND THEN THE OTHER AREA TRY TURN YOU TO- IT WOULD BE THE TIMING. MATTERS IF YOU LOOK A WITH ALL SORTS **** CAME INTO OFFICE. IN NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND THREE HE HAD THREE YEARS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RUN THE STATE. MAKE AN ARGUMENT FOR RE ELECTION. IF GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAD BEEN RECALLED AND LARRY ELDER WHOEVER WOULD HAVE STEPPED IN. HE WOULD HAVE HAD JUST A FEW MONTHS TO NUMBER ONE FIGURE OUT HOW TO WRITE A BUDGET. NUMBER TO INTRODUCE A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA WHICH PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD ON ARRIVAL LEGISLATURE. ENDS WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF TAKING OFFICE LOOKING AT A PRIMARY AND IF YOU DIDN'T FINISH AT LEAST SECOND IN THE PRIMARY HE WAS A POLITICAL LAME DUCK. SO I THINK WE NEED TO CONSIDER THE TIMING OF UP. A RECALL EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING GOVERNOR NEWSOM- THREE RECALL EFFORTS WERE FILED AGAINST IT BEFORE THE BIRTHDAY OF HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE. STEP RECALL EVER TO FALL AGAINST NOT JUST NEWSOME BUT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE SECRETARY OF STATE THE TREASURE. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE STATE COMPTROLLER ALL MARCH FIFTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN- THESE TO ME THE EQUIVALENT OF FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BECAUSE HE REALLY JUST GOING AFTER. THE PARTY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE NEW JERSEY HAS A PREVENTION IT WHICH ON THE RECALL PROCESS MAY NOT BEGIN UNTIL FIFTY DAYS BEFORE. THE COMPLETION OF THE INCUMBENTS FIRST YEAR. OF THE CURRENT TERM IN OFFICE MAYBE CAO. SHOULD CONSIDER THAT AS A WAY TO KIND OF JUST. THE NATURE RECALLED AND THEN MAYBE KILL. NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ON THE BACK AND PERHAPS YOU CANNOT HAVE A RECALL AFTER AN INCUMBENT IS IT MIDWAY. THROUGH THEIR TERM THAT WAY YOU GET INTO THIS RATHER COMPRESSED. UPCYCLED A TON. A WIN FOR THE PAST RECALL WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT. IF I SOUND LIKE A TILT IN FAVOR THE EXECUTIVE I PLEAD GUILTY I'VE WORKED FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR- IT'S A TOUGH ENOUGH JOB WITHOUT DISTRACTIONS. IRRITANTS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO CHANGE PROVISION WHICH LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BECOMES THE ACTING GOVERNOR. THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE- BUT THAT SAID LET'S KEEP THE RECALL PROCESS IT HONORS THE STATE'S LEGACY OF THE POLITICAL CLASS BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BUT YES IT'S CONSIDER WAYS TO MAKE THIS EVEN MORE EXCEPTIONAL AND MORE RARE. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PARTICIPATE THIS HEARING. ABOUT COMMEND YOU FOR GIVING THIS THE SERIOUS DELIBERATE OF THOUGHT AS WE SHARE THE IDEAL OF APPROVING CALIFORNIA EXPERIMENT IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY. THANK YOU GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THAT THANK YOU MISTER WILL EXPAND BY IN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE REALLY DIFFERENT- PHILOSOPHICAL VIEWS ABOUT MANY ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT BUT I. CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL. EXAMINE OF WHERE CAN. A FIND WAYS TO DO IT BETTER- IN THIS SPACE AND MANY OTHER SPACES BY THE WAY I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. JUST BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR LEADS THE STATE IS THAT. THERE'S NO PHONE PHONE ACCESS I GUESS- PROCESS LIKE WE'VE KIND OF GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER THERE. BUT SO I WANT TO INVITE A COLLEAGUES TO ASK QUESTIONS. OF THESE TWO PANELISTS. TWO WEEKS. AT THE CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER WHELAN THE- BONTA TOUCH BUILT ON THE GROUNDS FOR THE RECALL. CALIFORNIA NOW IS IT WOULD BE THE MORE ONEROUS STATE OR AT LEAST LESSER AREN'T OWNER STATE ON TERMS OF GROUNDS FOR RECALL. IS CALIFORNIA RIGHT DON'T LISTEN MORE OWNERS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION OKAY. DID THAT CALIPHATES CALIFORNIA REALLY VERY. RESTRICTIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. FOUR RECALLING OR ARE WE VERY VERY GENEROUS MAKING IT MORE MODESTY. WE'RE PRETTY WIDE OPEN UNDERSTAND YOU CAN JUST PUT YOUR COMPLAINTS ON THE BALLOT IN A WHERE YOU GO AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE YOU LOOK AT THE LAST VEHICLE AGAINST GOVERNOR NEWSOM WAS RATHER FAMILIAR LIST OF COMPLAINTS BY THE PARTY THAT OPPOSES HIM IN TERMS OF- HIS ACTIONS ON THE DEATH PENALTY IN TERMS OF IMMIGRATION POLICY. HM SO. YOU KNOW THE DEEP SET SPEED RIGHT THAT'S CONCERT IS INTERPRETING THE GOVERNMENT'S NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. I JUST THINK THAT YOU NEED TO ADD A COMPONENT TO IT WHICH REALLY GETS TO THE IDEA OF MALFEASANCE AND JUST NOT PERFORMING HER JOB PROPERLY. BECAUSE WE CAN ALL DISAGREE. ON POLICY CHOICES AND FRANKLY I THINK THAT'S WHAT REGULAR SCHEDULE ELECTIONS ARE FOR. BUT ISN'T THAT. TO BE LITIGATED HEAVILY MALFEASANCE IT MEANS DIFFERENT THANKS. RIGHT THAT'S WHY I THINK FIFTY. RIGHT IT DOES BUT I THINK IT REALLY GETS DOWN TO A QUESTION OF CONDUCT UNBECOMING AN OFFICE. AND WITH THE GOVERNOR LET'S SAY DOES SOMETHING THAT YOU OPPOSED TO PHILOSOPHICALLY I'M NOT SURE THAT REALLY MEANS OF THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE RECALLED FROM HIS OFFICE AGAIN I THINK WE HAVE A SEAT GARDEN THAT'S CALLED AN ELECTION. REGULAR SCHEDULE H. WE DO WE DO HAVE THAT FOR SURE. YES AND YOU KNOW IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION. THE PROPONENTS DID NOT SPEND A LOT OF MONEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES EITHER TO QUALIFY AND MOST CERTAINLY NOT TO CAMPAIGN FOR. GOVERNOR HAD ALMOST UNLIMITED RESOURCES THE NEW CAMPAIGN. AGAIN RIGHT AND A LOT OF THEM CAME FROM NONTRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC SOURCES FOR THEIR OWN REASONS WHATEVER THOSE WERE THEY CONTRIBUTED HEAVILY. TO RELISH THE RECALL SHALL I BRING THAT TO POINT TO BEAR JUST THAT THERE'S A BALANCING OF FACTORS. ASCENDED TO QUALIFY HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO QUALIFY HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO IN FACT RECALL WHAT GROUNDS FOR THE RECALL WOULD BE. THE REASON I OFFER THOSE OBSERVATIONS IS I'M I'M RGUING I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANYTHING O AGREE JUSTLY BROKEN IN CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK IT MISTER CARILLO FURTHER ALLUDED TO THAT WITH 96% DO NOT EVEN QUALIFY- GRATEFUL THAT SHOWS IT'S PRETTY TOUGH IN CALIFORNIA TO DO A RECALL. AND SAY WHATEVER YOU WILL ABOUT HAVING THE OVER WHATEVER YEARS BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN MUCH. SO I WOULD SAY THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS BEEN PRETTY RESPONSIBLE AND REASONABLE OVER THE YEARS. BUT IN ALL AREAS WE SPEND WAY TOO MUCH MONEY IN ELECTIONS. AND MAYBE. CAMPAIGN FINANCE LIMITATIONS IN THE CAMPAIGN PORTION. OF THIS WOULD BE IN ORDER DO YOU SEE WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE. YOU RESULTS IN QUESTION PERHAPS WE NEED TO CONSIDER RUNNING OUT THE GOVERNOR EVEN IF HE OR SHE IS A SUBJECT TO RECALL SHOULD HAVE TO COMPLY BY. CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN DONATION LIMITS BECAUSE IT DOES OPEN UP IN A COUPLE QUESTION WHICH IS IF I GIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO THE GOVERNOR'S RE ELECTED GOVERNORS ALL. QUID PRO QUO POLITICS WHAT I'M EXPECTING IN RETURN. WELL IF IT DID THERE CERTAINLY. COULD BE ALLUDED TO THAT INDEED AND I DO MAKE THE POINT. THAT THE PROJECT THERE'S A CHECK AND BALANCE THAT. PROPONENTS USUALLY TO RECALL. DO NOT HAVE MANY RESOURCES TOGETHER SIGNATURES THEY CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO HIRE. SIGNATURE GATHERERS. BUT IT COULD BE VERY DIFFERENT IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR ONE WHO IS AN ELECTIVE OFFICE OF THE LEVERAGE THEIR IN THE INHERENT- TO BE ABLE TO RAISE MONEY. FOR THAT RECALL EFFORT SHALL DIE I WILL WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS LET'S TAKE THESE THINGS ALL IN CONTEXT AND WEIGH THEM AGAINST EACH OTHER NOT JUST MAKE THE EXCEPTION THAT DOESN'T AGREE JUST PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK THERE'S CLEARLY NOT IN THE GREGIS PROBLEM. THERE MAY BE SOME FINE TUNING IN ORDER. BUT NOT AN EGREGIOUS PROBLEM. AN IMPORTANT THING IS TO REMEMBER RATHER HOW THEY DID NOT WORK CALYXT ORDINARILY WELL IT HAS WORKED FOR THE DECADES INSURING. THE CITIZENS THEIR VOICE THROUGH THE INITIATIVE THE REFERENDUM ON THE RECALL. I KNOW THAT'S A GOOD. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER WHELAN- YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S HAVE A LITTLE FUN HERE FOR A MOMENT- LET'S SAY THAT THE RECALL HAPPEN AND GOVERNOR USES FIRST YEAR VERSUS IS THIRTY YEAR. AND OUT OF THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS TODAY MISTER ELDER BECOMES THE GOVERNOR. SO AND IT ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION A RECALL REFORM IS THAT IT'S ONCE AGAIN PUT IN A POLITICAL PRISM OF THE MOMENT. BUT LET'S SAY UNDER THIS SCENARIO- THE GET NOW GOVERNOR ELDER. HAD STRONG VIEWS ABOUT TO ISSUES OF- CHOICE. OF GUNS RIGHT. OF OFFSHORE OIL OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO TAKE A LESS THAN A YEAR'S WORTH OF DECISIONS ARE EXECUTIVE ACTIONS. THAT THEY DIFFERED WITH TO THEN QUALIFY RECALL AGAINST NOW REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR ELDER- WELL AGAIN IT WITHOUT A STANDARD OF MALFEASANCE. AS WE AS YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO. THERE WOULD BE NO THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE DEMOCRATS WOULD WANT TO. REVISIT THAT ELECTION AGAIN WHEN YOU SUGGEST GIVEN. HIS ELECTION IN A RECALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS THAN A MAJORITY VOTE. THERE WOULD BE MULTIPLE RECALL EFFORTS AGAINST REGARDLESS BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA POLITICS ARE RIGHT NOW- PETE WILSON HAD EIGHT RECALL ATTEMPTS AGAINST HIM CHORE TO BEIJING HAD ELEVEN. JERRY BROWN HAD FIVE GAVIN NEWSOM'S HAD SIX SO FOR AN AVERAGE OF TWO YEARS SO HE MY SHATTER THE RECORD SO. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF LARRY ELDER WERE IN OFFICE YOU WOULD SEE MULTIPLE RECALL EFFORTS THE QUESTION WOULD BE. HOW MANY HELP IF ANY OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY REACH THE THRESHOLD OF GETTING ON THE BALLOT THAT SUGGESTS THE GIVEN HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. WOULD NOT BE HARD TO QUALIFY. THE RECALL EFFORT IF YOU JUST HAVE THE TIME IN THE MUSCLE TO PUT BEHIND IT AND THERE'S ENOUGH MUSCLE CALIFORNIA DO THAT SO. I THINK WE WOULD LOOK AT A SITUATION WHERE THE PROBABLY WOULD'VE BEEN A RECALL ELECTION THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND JUST YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A LOT OF WHAT GOOD WAY TO RUN A REAL WORLD IS NOT A GOOD. WAY TO RUN GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU FOR A- AT. ABOUT HYPE OF. BUT NOT SO FAR OFF HYPOTHETICAL UNDER THAT. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I WANT TO BRING BACK UP FOR A- PROFESSOR CARILLO. A PROFESSOR CARILLO. USED AS THE BASIS FOR YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT A SIGNATURE CHANGE THE ISSUE OF THE COST PER SIGNATURE. BASED ON I GUESS I'LL STARKELDATA. THAT YOU HAVE LOOKED AT IN THAT SPACE. BUT I WANT TO BRING YOU TO THE TWO RECALLS THAT WE HAVE JUST EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE COST PER- PER SIGNATURE WAS ON THE RECALL THAT WE JUST WENT THROUGH. IN- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. YES I BELIEVE IT WAS IN THE FIVE TO SEVEN DOLLAR RANGE AND FOR TWO THOUSAND THREE HISTORICALLY AND BELIEVES IN THE TO THE THREE DOLLAR RANGE. RIGHT BUT THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THE PRO RECALL SUPPORTERS SPENT OVER TEN MILLION DOLLARS T QUALIFY THAT MEASURE FOR THE BALLOT. IN ONE. AND THIS IS BASED ON PUBLIC ACCOUNTS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT WAS AN ALL VOLUNTEER EFFORT UP UNTIL THE POINT THAT THEY GOT AN EXTENSION OF TIME. AND AT THAT POINT THEY GOT AN INFUSION OF CASH IN IT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE RULING COUNT OF SIGNATURES. IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT DURING THE VOLUNTEER PERIOD ABSENT THE EXTENSION THEY WERE NOT ON PACE TO QUALIFY. IT WAS THE FACT THAT THE EXTENSION HAPPENED AND THEN THE MOMENT CAME IN THOSE TWO THINGS COMBINED. ALLOWED THEM TOGETHER ENOUGH SIGNATURES. RIGHT BUT WHAT IS THE RECORD SHALL AND HOW MUCH THEY REYES TO QUALIFY THE RECALL FOR THE BALLOT WHAT ARE THE FACTS SHOW THEIR- THAT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WITH THE ULTIMATE REYES WAS. OKAY BECAUSE I WOULD WELCOME THAT- THAT INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. SO THE PROGRESS. YEAH WITHOUT BUT BECAUSE THE PREMISE OF YOUR CONCERNS IS THAT IT'S SEVEN DOLLARS A SIGNATUREYET. IN THIS LATEST RECALL WAS EVEN CLOSE TO SEVEN DOLLARS A SIGNATUR THAT I'M JUST KIND OF. TRY TO GET THE FACTS ON ON THE PREMISE THAT YOU'RE SETTING THE FOUNDATION FOR WHY YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. RAISING THAT SIGNATURE LIMIT. IT'S NOT A ONE TO ONE COMPARISON BECAUSE AS I SAID THIS THIS RECALL EFFORT WAS SPLIT YOU KNOW IT'S A HYBRID OF WHAT WILL BE TAKE WHICH HERE IS THAT. THE COST INVOLVED IT'S VERY IS PROHIBITIVELY DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR SIGNATURE GATHERING EFFORT. TO SUCCEED IN QUALIFYING A RECALL FOR THE BALLOT AND EVEN REMOTELY QUALIFIED TO THINK THIS TWENTY TWENTY ONE RECALL IT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT APPROVED A POINT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ON PACE. ABSENT THE EXTENSION OF TIME WHICH THEN BROUGHT IN NATIONAL MONEY THAT ALLOWED THEM TO PAY SIGNATURE GATHERERS SO THAT'S. OPPOSED TO THINGS THAT THEY WERE TO FAIL. YEAH SO I. THAT AND LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THE FACTS ON EXACTLY HOW MUCH WAS. SPENT TO QUALIFY THE SIGNATURES BECAUSE IT DOES GO TO THE HEART THE PREMISE OF. THE TESTIMONY THAT YOU PROVIDED TO US TODAY JERRY BERMAN OF A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YES SO. THE COUPLE THOUGHTS REALLY APPRECIATE BOTH PRESENTATIONS I MEAN I DON'T YOU THAT THE FOR THE FACT THAT IT WAS NOT ON. PACE TO QUALIFY. WHAT WAS REALLY JUST. A KIND OF A- THE SIGNAL OF WHAT WE EVENTUALLY SAW. WHICH IS THAT IT FAILED SPECTACULARLY RIGHT IT GOT 38% OF THE VOTE WE SPENT THE STATE SPENT ALMOST THREEHUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- AND HAVE A MASSIVEAMOUNT OF DISTRACTION. TO OUR OUR GOVERNING PROCESS FOR SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY DID NOT HAVE A MAJORITY SUPPORT- OF CALIFORNIANS AND SO WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO DO IS FIGURE OUT A PROCESS. BY WHERE YOU NEED THE PROCESS TO QUALIFY. SHOW SOME SORT OF CERTAINTY THAT YOU'RE AT LEAST GOING TO GET CLOSE. YOU KNOW IT DOES HAVE THE GUARANTEE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A MAJORITY OF THE VOTE. TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR- OR THE ELECTED OFFICIAL BUT IT SHOWS THAT. YOU'RE AT LEAST GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE I AM TRYING TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND THAT THERE IS A CLOSE TO A MAJORITY OFPEOPLE IN A JURISDICTION TO AGREE WITH YOU- A ABOUT IT. I ALSO WONDER YOU KNOW WHENEVER YOU RECALL PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED. IN ADDITION WITHOUT A DIRECT DEMOCRACY POLICIES BY. YOU KNOW- THE FUTURE GOVERNOR JEB- HIRAM JOHNSON. THE HUNDRED TEN YEARS AGO. I CAN'T IMAGINE HE WAS. FIGURE YOU KNOW DETERMINING THE POLICIES BASED ON PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS FOREIGN EFFORT. I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT THERE'S A POPULAR UPRISING- AND THAT THEREFORE. WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE THE- URGENCY AND ENERGY AND INTEREST- TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME TO COLLECT SIGNATURES IN YOUR AYE I TOTALLY AGREE THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE. THAT MIGHT NOT GET TO A THAT'S TO BE A SIGNIFICANT. PART OF THE SIGNATURE GAHERING PROCESS AND THEN IF YOU NEED TO CAP IT OFF WITH PAID SIGNATURES- TO GET OVER THE HUMP. YOU KNOW THEN THEN THEN THAT'S VALID BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK WE SHOULD DO AN ANALYSIS THAT ASSUMES. THAT EVERY SIGNATURE THAT IS GATHERED NEEDS TO BE DONE BY. BY PAID SIGNATURE GATHERERS. SO THAT'S THAT'S A LITTLE MORE OF A- APPOINTED A HAPPY THAT TO HAVE FOLKS COMMENTS- BUT WAS REALLY ALSO. KIND OF IMPRESSED BY. SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM ISRAEL AND- THAT WERE VERY SIMILAR MISTER WILL YOU DON'T KNOW THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU CAN GET A CHANCE TO JUMP ON INTO A LITTLE BIT AGO- BUT WERE VERY SIMILAR TO COMMENTS ARE MADE BY CENTER SQUISHY. ESCU TIA- IN IN A PRIOR PANEL. WHERE SHE ALSO POINTED US TO GEORGIA- IN THAT EXACT LANGUAGE THAT YOU MENTIONED- IN GEORGIA'S RECALL PROCESS AND HAVING SOME DEFINITION AROUND MALFEASANCE- AND DIFFERENT WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT DEFINE THAT. IF THAT'S A- A WAY THAT WE WANT TO GO SO YOU KNOW THAT WAS THAT. YOU KNOW THAT PLUS. THE POINTS AROUND THE DISTRACTION AND YOU'RE A TENSE THAT THAT RECALL. LAW CREATES- WERE VERY SIMILAR TO COMMENTS MADE BY. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER JIM CAN MEAN- SO WE'RE SEEING SOME SOME KIND OF. COMMON THREADS HERE- BUT THAT'S THAT'S- YOU KNOW MY QUICK COMMENTS I KNOW. OF THE MR CHRIS GOT TO GO SOON. YES NUMBER. COMPOUND THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR REAL QUICK THE COST THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PER SIGNATURE I WANT TO MAKE THIS REALLY CLEAR IS NOT BORNE BY THE STATE IT IS BORN BY HOME. THAT'S MY TO PROPONENTS SO THEY HAVE TO GO OUT THEY HAVE TO RAISE MONEY THEY HAVE TO GET PEOPLE TO DONATE SO THAT THEY CAN GET. A SIGNATURE EFFORT IN PLACE- WE KEEP GOING BACK TO OUR LAST. EFFORT AND TALKING ABOUT THE EXTENSION THE EXTENSION OF TIME ONCE IN A PARTISAN THING IT WAS GIVEN BY JUDGE BECAUSE OF COVERT. AND COVERT AFFECTED A LOT OF THINGS AND YOU'RE RIGHT AND ALL IT DOES IS KIND OF PROVE. THAT THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND EVEN THIS PROCESS THAT DO WE JUST WENT THROUGH WOULD NOT HAVE QUALIFIED. IF THE JUDGE HAD GIVEN THEM MORE TIME TO GO GET SIGNATURES. SO TO ME WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A BROKEN PROCESS. WELL WASN'T BROKEN WE WILL KNOW SPENT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH AFTER REMIND US SOME OF THAT IS OUR OWN DOING. WHEN WE WHEN WE CHOOSE. TO TAKE 50% OF THE BALANCE THAT WE MAIL OUT AND THROW THOSE AWAY THAT'S THREE BUCKS A PIECE IN THIS PARTICULAR ELECTION. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS GOING INTO THE TRASH. OKAY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COSTS. THAT'S THE PART WHERE WE HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT COST NOT THIS PART. THIS PART IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MAD ENOUGH. AND ANGRY ENOUGH TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT- SO- ONE OF THE OTHER. POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE WEB I'D LOST IT NOW SO. ANYWAY BUT THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR YOU MISTER COREY I KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT GET GOING SO- I APPRECIATE THE YOUR ANALYSIS AND YOUR EXPLANATIONS. OF SOMETHING THAT WAS IN MY HEAD AND I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ARTICULATED AND YOU ARTICULATED VERY WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU ASSEMBLY NUMBER. OKAY I WANT TO THANK POSTUP PROFESSOR CARILLO AND MR WHELAN. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY CARE. BERMAN AND I WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. IMPORTANT VOICES THE THOUGHTFUL VOICES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS THE DEBATE. IT WASN'T ABOUT ONE POINT OF VIEW OR ANOTHER BUT A BROAD RANGE OF PERSPECTIVES AND WE AND YOU YOU BUT YOU BOTH HAVE BROUGHT THAT TO OUR- CONVERSATION TODAY I WOULD NOTE THAT PROFESSOR CREO THAT YOU- PUT FORWARD A UP. A BROADER THOUGHT PIECE ON THIS WHOLE SUBJECT AREA WE DIDN'T GET THE CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT ALL THOSE L. EXTRA AREAS BUT- IT'S A PART OF OUR RECORD WILL HAVE MAKE IT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE FOR OTHERS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN IT. I SEAT UP THE CENTER NIELSEN HAS COME FORWARD WITH IT I THINK OF ALL OF. MORE OF AN OBSERVATION. GERMAN AND COLLEAGUES THAT. THIS PART. RECALL WAS I THANK MORE A PRODUCT. OF CITIZEN DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EXERCISE OF GOVERNORS OF FLORIDA E. THAT REALLY EXCEEDED HIS AUTHORITY NOW. IN PART THAT IS A PART OF THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE FOR DECADES. MOST RECENTLY THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN BACK. THE LEGISLATURE REGULARLY HAS SHE AND THE PEOPLE'S AUTHORITY TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE UNILATERAL DECISIONS. MOST RECENTLY IN THE LAST BUDGET. A PROVISION FORTUNATELY THAT WAS REMOVED THAT SAID MONIES THAT COULD BE EXPANDED FOR FORCED A WILDLAND PROTECTION WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE DEBATE THAT THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IT WAS QUOTE NEEDED. NOW THAT'S CLEARLY. USURPING AUTHORITY BUT THE LEGISLATURE IS EXPRESSLY BEEN GIVEN MORE AUTHORITY TO GOVERNORS AND GOVERNORS AND PRESIDENTS BOTH PARTIES. HAVE EXERCISED THEIR AUTHORITY I THINK BEYOND WHAT THEY SHOULD. IT'S RIGHT LET AT THE IMPROPER THAT THE CITIZENS SHOULD BE UPSET ABOUT THAT I THINK THAT WAS A BIGGER FACTORED IN THE NUMBERS OF SIGNATURES THAT WERE REQUIRED. THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE POLICY. THERE PROBABLY WERE PLENTY OF THE OCEAN BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC IS GETTING PRETTY FED UP. WITH THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN MORE AUTHORITY JACQUI BRANCH AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES USURPING THEIR POWER OR STARTING THEIR POWER. THROUGH UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS AND THEY GET AWAY WITH THANK YOU MR CENTER NIELSEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS. I WOULD NOTE THAT. THERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES EVEN THE ONES THAT YOU ARE CITING IN WHICH THE REMEDY WAS THROUGH THE COURTS TO CHALLENGE THOSE DECISIONS AND IN SOME CASES THEY WERE. THEY WERE REVERSED SO THERE WAS REMEDIES WITHIN THE LAW ABSENT THE RECALL TO TRY TO. GET THE- THE RESULTS THAT YOU DESIRED- AND I THINK THAT WHAT UP. THROUGH A GROUP THAT MR WHELAN HAS EVER WAITED ON AS HAVE OTHERS IS THAT IS A POLICY DISAGREEMENT EVEN OLD LEGAL DISAGREEMENT- THE STANDARD IN WHICH WE SHOULD USE TODAY- OR SHOULD THERE BE A HIGHER STANDARD THAT SHOULD BE- IN PLACE AND THAT'S THAT WERE THE DEBATE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. SO PROFESSOR CREEL THANK YOU MISTER WHELAN THANK YOU FOR. YOUR CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT ON THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THIS PANEL AND- TURN IT OVER TO CHAIR. A BERMAN TO CONTINUE THANK YOU CHAIR GLAZER AROUND A BRIEF INTERLUDE TO- GO BACK TO- SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON IF SUPERVISOR MCPHERSON. IS STILL THERE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A COMMENT THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE- IN REGARDS TO ONE OF THE PRIOR PANELISTS. MISTER MCPHERSON AGAINST. YEAH ARE YOU HERE I I'M SORRY OPEN NOT A DOING THIS BUT NOT ALL. MR MORGAN SAID THERE WERE FIVE STATE WHO REPLACED BY I WAS JUST CURIOUS. WHO MADE REAP MUCH- AND- WAS THERE ANY RIGHT YOU'RE HERE. ARE THEY MAKING THEIR THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT REQUIRE. ALL GOOD QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL IN TO I DON'T THINK MISTER WILLIAMS IS STILL STILL ONLINE- BUT BUT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION- SO SOMETHING THAT WILL LOOK AT INTO- BETWEEN NOW IN THE NEXT HEARING. THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT. SO WILL NOW MOVE ON TO THE FINAL PANEL OF TODAY'S HEARING- THIS PANEL WILL DISCUSS VARIOUS PROPOSALS FOR CHANGING THE PROCESS. FOR REPLACING A RECALLED OFFICIAL SO MAYBE THIS IS- EXECUTIVE MISTER MCPHERSON'S POINT I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF OUR PANELISTS- HAVE- THE ANSWERS MISTER MCPHERSON'S QUESTION. STARTING US OFF IS JESSICA A. LEVINSON A PROFESSOR AT LOYOLA LOYOLA LAW SCHOOL WERE FISH WHERE SHE FOCUSES ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. AND ELECTIONLAW. SHE'S ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF LOYOLA'S PUBLIC SERVICE INSTITUTE. AND THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE JOURNALISTS LAW SCHOOL AND PROFESSOR LEVINSON PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT. OF THE LOS ANGELES ETHICS COMMISSION- THE PROFESSOR LEVINSON- AND WHEN WE WHAT WE'LL TAKE THEM ONE AT A TIME. R. AND IT IS ONE OF THE AVAILABLE IS DOWN THE WHOLE TIME TO THINK. SO ABOUT CERTAINLY NOT BEYOND GOT IT- SO HOPEFULLY- WE CAN HAVE EVERYBODY PARTICIPATE IN THE MAYBE ASK WESTON'S. AT THE END- BUT IF ANYBODY IF ANY OF MY OF MY COLLEAGUES. YEAH REALLY HAVE A BURNING QUESTION THEY WANT TO ASK A SPECIFIC PANELIST IMMEDIATELY LET ME KNOW- SO PROFESSOR LEVINSON. PLEASE PLEASE BEGIN. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME- I CAN'T STAY ON PASSED ABOUT THREE FORTY SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT AFFECTS HOW YOU WANNA TAKE THE QUESTIONS SO YOU ASK ME OF COURSE TO SPEAK ABOUT SOMETHING PRETTY NARROW WHICH IS JUST THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES AND I'M GONNA START BY SAYING SOMETHING MAYBE KIND OF SUBVERSIVE ANYTHING TO MISTER MCPHERSON'S POINT ARTIST QUESTION WHICH IS I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD HAVE REPLACEMENT CANDIDATES I THINK THAT WE IF WE HAVE A RECALL AND IT TO BE A LOT HARDER HARDER TO HAVE A RECALLS THEN WE SHOULD GO THROUGH AN APPOINTMENT PROCESS OR IN THE CASE. OF A GOVERNOR BEING RECALLED WE SHOULD GO THROUGH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND I'LL MAKE MY POINTS REALLY BRIEF AFTER THIS BUT I'LL JUST SAY YOU KNOW I LISTEN TO A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY SO FAR OBVIOUSLY REALLY USEFUL AND- I WOULD SAY IS THE RECALL. YOU KNOW A REALLY SCREWED UP SYSTEM TO USE A LEGAL TERM ABSOLUTELY IS IT WORTH FIXING I'M NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR ON THAT IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF HOW OFTEN WE USE IT AND HOW OFTEN IT SUCCESSFUL SO IS THIS THE SYSTEM YOU WOULD EVER WANT TO USE AND DESIGN IN A MILLION YEARS NOW IS THIS THE SYSTEM THAT WE SHOULD REALLY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO REFORM BECAUSE WE THINK THERE'S A CHANCE OF THIS ACTUALLY PASSING ON THE BALLOT. PROBABLY NOT LET'S REMEMBER IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT TENDS TO UNITE OUR VOTERS NOT JUST DEMOCRATS NOT JUST REPUBLICANS FOR ALL VOTERS IT'S THE WHIFF OF ANYTHING THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE TAKING POWER AWAY FROM THEM SO I WOULD JUST CAUTION YOU TO YOU KNOW THE BIG REFORMS I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE POPULAR SO. ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT YOU ASKED ME TO SPEAK VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT BASICALLY HOW COULD WE CHANGE THE- WELL LET'S BE BLUNT HOW CAN WE GET RID OF THE SO CALLED CLOWN CAR RATE HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT AREN'T FORTY SIX CANDIDATES RUNNING AND THAT YOU KNOW THREE OF THEM ARE COMPETITIVE. AND THE- ANSWER IS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS CODE AND REALIZE WHAT YOU ALL KNOW WHICH IS THAT THE WAY WE DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE RECALL CANDIDATES IS THE SAME WAY WE DETERMINE QUALIFICATIONS FOR. CANDIDATES FOR THAT OFFICE IN A REGULAR ELECTION SO THE THRESHOLD QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE TO ANSWER FOR YOURSELVES IS BASICALLY. DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW SO THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE. SO THAT THE WAY YOU DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE GOVERNOR IS DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY YOU DETERMINE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO BE. A REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE IN A GUBERNATORIAL RECALL- OR DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR. CANDIDATES PERIOD SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER AND BE AWARE OUR FRIEND. SECOND THING IS OF COURSE THERE'S REALLY TWO LEVERS TO PULL HERE RIGHT THERE'S THE FILING FEE WHATEVER. AND THEN THERE'S THE SIGNATURE GATHERING LAST LEVER AND YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS. TO SAY DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO MAKE IT HARDER. AND THE ANSWER IS YES IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE IT HARDER BECAUSE WE'VE JUST LIVED THROUGH. A RECALL ELECTION WHERE. I MEAN SHOW OF HANDS FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK ON THE BALLOT AND BEING A LITTLE FACETIOUS HERE BUT- THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE BALLOT IN. MOST OF THEM HAD NO CHANCE OF BEING THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN. THE LAST AND WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT BUT I WOULD SAY SHOULD WE MAKE IT HARDER GAS. WHAT'S THE BEST NUMBER. YOU KNOW IT. I DON'T AND I DON'T KNOW EXCEPT TO SAY THAT YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT SO THAT THERE'S ONLY TWO PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD THE FILING FEE- YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT SO THAT YOU GET THE SIRIUS CANADA THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THE RECALL CANDIDATES LET'S ALWAYS HAVE IN MIND THE VOTERS THE VOTERS HAVE A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME TO TRY AND READ UP ON SOMEBODY WHO MIGHT BE THEIR NEXT GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR STATE LAWMAKER. AND SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THAT BUCKET OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE NEXT- QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE RECALL CANDIDATES THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE VOTERS OF MORE INFORMATION MAYBE IT YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO A BIPARTISAN QUESTIONNAIRE MAYBE IT'S A ROOT MORE ROBUST STATEMENT OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS I WOULD OFFER FOR YOU IT'S PROBABLY NOT AND I YOU KNOW RELEASE YOUR TAXES WE CAN FAX OBVIOUSLY BEEN AN ISSUE WE CAN LEAVE THAT TO THE SIDE FOR A SECOND BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ANY OF THESE REFORMS TO THE RECALL I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE DOING WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING. WHICH IS THINK ABOUT HOW TO SERVE THE VOTERS YOU DO NOT WANT ME VOTING FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS ALL OF MY PARENTS FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY ALL SAY TO ME JESSICA WHO'S A GOOD CANDIDATE WHO WHAT SHOULD WE VOTE FOR WHAT WE NEED TO NOW OKAY LET'S NOT RELY ON ME LET'S ALLOW THE VOTERS TO RELY ON THEIR OWN JUDGMENT. AND WITH THAT IT'S PROBABLY WELL OVER FIVE MINUTES NO THAT'S THAT THAT'S GREAT AND DEFINITELY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR BLUNTNESS ON THE LIST OF X. SO WELL I THINK WE SHOULD WHAT WILL KEEP IN MIND THE THREE FORTY- TIME LIMIT BUT LET'S TRY TO GO ON THE ASSEMBLY OTHER PRESENTERS AND THEN COME BACK FOR BROAD QUESTIONS THE NEXUS- FACT CAL'S- PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL. AND COTERA. I'M NOT READ OUT MY RIGHT- TALKING POINTS WE WILL NOW HEAR. FROM FACT HAUSER THE PROFESSOR POLITICAL SCIENCE AND CO DIRECTOR OF THE YANKELOVICH CENTER FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO DOCTOR CAL'S- JOIN THE POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND IT SERVED AS CHAIR SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN HE SAID HIS AMERICAN STATE AND NATIONAL POLITICS VOTING REFORMS. DIRECT DEMOCRACY AND HOW LIKE IT OFFICIALS USE SOCIAL MEDIA- PROFESSOR CAL'S- READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WANT TO BE. I'M JUST SHARING MY INDIVIDUAL VIEW TODAY- AND IN NO WAY REFLECT THOSE HE SEES AS A WHOLE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TEARS GLAZER AND BERMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. COURT IN TWO WAYS THAT WE- CALL MORE EVIDENCE OF THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. SO THE THERE ARE MANY IDEAS THAT I DESERVE USE YOUR CENSORSHIP BUT TO MY MIND THE SINGLE BIGGEST AND MOST IN FACT IMPACTFUL CHANGE WOULD BE TO SEPARATE THE PROCESS OF HOLDING A RECALL ELECTION FROM THE PROCESS OF SELECTING A REPLACEMENT CAN. BY KEEPING A SEPARATE WE CAN HAVE THE RECALL PROPERLY FOCUSED ON WHETHER THE OFFICE HOLDERS SUCH AS THE GOVERNOR IS TRULY FIT FOR OFFICE AND THEN IF IT SUCCEEDS YOU COULD HAVE STRONG CANDIDATES FROM BOTH PARTIES FREE TO ENTER THE REPLACEMENT CONTEST AND THEY WOULD COMPETE FOR THE VOTES OF A LARGE AND REPRESENTATIVE ELECTRIC. BY CONTRAST DOING THINGS THE WAY WE DO NOW IN CALIFORNIA FUSING THESE INTO A SINGLE BALLOT SOMETHING THEY WERE AN OUT LIAR ON THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER STATE DOES THAT IT POSES TWO FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES FOR DEMOCRACY IN THE RECALL PROCESS. THE FIRST IS IT CREATES AN IRRESISTIBLE INVITATION FOR THE INCUMBENT PARTY TO MANIPULATE THE ELECTION BY CLEARING THE FIELD OF CANDIDATES IN AND ALSO BY CLEARING THE FIELD OF VOTERS SO THIS IS BECAUSE THESE TWO QUESTIONS REFUSE. ANY CANDIDATE FACING THE THREAT OF A RECALL KNOWS THAT THE KIDS AVAILABLE REPLACEMENT CONTEST WILL HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON WEATHER HERE SHE SURVIVES THE RECALL OR NOT. SO WHAT DOES THAT EXPIRE POLITICIAN DO WHAT THEY DO WHAT WE SAW IN THIS RECALL WHICH BY THE WAY BECAUSE IT WAS SO SUCCESSFUL THIS WILL BE THE PLAYBOOK FOR THE NEXT RECALLS THAT WE SEEN CALIFORNIA WHETHER THEY'RE ANOTHER EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX OR SEVENTY TWO YEARS AWAY. RIGHT. WHAT DID WHAT DOES IT. WE CALL THE FISH OKAY WORK. THE FIELD TO ENSURE THE PERTAINING PRECOCIAL AND- AND SCRIPTER AND REPLACING THEM WITH A- WITH A MEMBER OF THE OTHER PARTY RIGHT SO VOTERS FACED THIS DIFFICULT CHOICE AND- AND THAT HELPS THE RECALLED OFFICIAL THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL STUNNINGLY SUCCESSFUL THIS YEAR IN THE RECALL CONTEST IT WILL BE EMULATED IN FUTURE ELECTIONS IT HELPED THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNOR WIN. BUT VOTERS LOST RIGHT THIS WASN'T A DECISION VOTERS MADE THEY DIDN'T NARROW THE FIELD AND THE FIELD WAS NARROWED FOR THEM- IT WAS SOMETHING WHERE IT WAS HELPFUL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BUT BUT DEEPLY UNHEALTHY THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS NOT TAPPED STRONG CANDIDATES ON EACH SIDE. THE SECOND THING THAT WAS A BIG REPRESENTATION A PROBLEM WITH THIS RECALL WAS THAT AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY OF HELPING TO PROTECT THE INCOMING ON THE FIRST QUESTION. THE INCUMBENT AND HIS PARTY URGED VOTERS TO STAY OUT OF THE SECOND QUESTION THIS LED TO SOMETHING I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD FIVE MILLION PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN THE SELECTION AND TAYING FOR HALF OF THAT NOT HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN THIS THIS WAS BOTH A MUCH SMALLER ELECTRIC. BUT ALSO A LESS REPRESENTATIVE ELECTED TO THE UC SAN DIEGO YANKELOVICH SURVEY CANTAT LOOKED AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE WHO WERE PARTICIPATING IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION THE TWENTY AT THE RECALL ELECTION IN THE REPLACEMENT CONTEST WE FOUND TRACKING OUR SAMPLE THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE IN THE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE RECOLOR PLACEMENT CONTEST- WHO WERE MORE LIKELY TO. TO BE RICHER BUT MORE AFFLUENT VOTERS IN FAR FEWER VOTERS MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR LESS MORE LIKELY BE WHITE VOTERS FAR FEWER BLACK AND AAPI VOTERS AND ALSO THAT THIS WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE IDEOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA SELECTED SO. REACHED TWO PROBLEMS RIGHT HAVING FEWER CANDIDATES AND FEWER VOTERS IN THE POOL WE'RE ALL A FUNCTION OF A POLITICAL REACTION TO DEFUSE THE BALLOT. TO HOW DO YOU SOLVE THAT YOU SEPARATE THE TWO BALLOTS. YOU HAVE RECALL CONTEST AND THEN IF ONLY IF IT IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL. A MONTH OR TWO LATER YOU REPLACED YOU HAVE A REPLACEMENT RACE. BOB THIS IS SOME OF THE VOTERS SUPPORTED THAT YANKELOVICH SURVEY BY. 4937% MARK DEFENDERS WERE SUPPORT. PROPOSAL I DO SOMETHING THAT DOES HAVE ONE POLITICAL DRAWBACK RIGHT TO POTENTIAL COST OF THIS YOU WOULD HAVE TO RUN. A STACK ALEXION. FIRST THAT COST WOULD ONLY BE BORN IF THE RECALL IS SUCCESSFUL RIGHT REALITIES OF THE DEAD DID IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT CONTEST NO ADDITIONAL STATE COSTS MUCH OF THE CRITICISM. OF THE COST OF RECALL IS THAT IT WAS COST IT WAS ACOSTA BURKE FOR AN ELECTION IT DIDN'T HAVE POPULAR SUPPORT THIS WOULD ONLY TRIGGER THAT THAT COST IF THERE IS POPULAR SUPPORT. IN SECOND ANOTHER WAY TO ADDRESS THE COST ARGUMENT BEING ALTERNATIVE VERSION OF THIS WHICH IS THE HOLDER BECAUSE- A CONTEST ON YEAH. SO ELEMENT CANADA. AND IF IT IS SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE A REPLACE CONTEST INITIALLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE ELECTION WITH AN APPOINTEE I SERVING AS A CARETAKER IN TELL THEM. SO THANKS VERY MUCH AFTER CONSIDERING THAT IDEA WHICH I THINK IS THE ONE THAT WOULD RESTORE THE MOST OUT THE FULLEST VOICE OF THE ELECTRIC. IN THE FOURTH CHIU BUSES FOR VOTERS TO OUR RECALL PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A PROFESSOR CAL SIR AND IT LOOKS LIKE WE SHOULD BE ON TIME TO GET THE QUESTIONS FOR EVERYBODY WANTS OUR BIGGEST CHANCE TO PRESENT TO NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON. AND HEAR FROM KARTHICK RAMAKRISHNAN. A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY AT THAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE. HE FOUNDED THE CENTER FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION AT UC RIVERSIDE. INSURES THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS. DOCTOROW KRISHNAN- BLEASE PRESENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S A MEMBER BERMAN AND CO CHAIR- SO AB I THINK A LOT OF BEEN SAID AND I'LL I DON'T FOCUS ON ONE- ASPECT OF IT BUT PT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF A LARGER THEME WHICH IS THAT THE RECALL THE WAITERS CURRENTLY DESIGNED MAKES A MOCKERY OF MAJORITY RULE- NARAL WILL BE SOLVED IT'S TEMPTING TO ONLY THINK ABOUT THE MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE OF THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL AND TO NOT SEE HOW- MAJORITY RULE IS THREATENED IN A MORE GENERAL WAY. SO I JUST SAID I MIX SOME A FEW KEY POINTS AND TO TALK ABOUT WHY THE SOLUTION I WAS HAVING A SINGLE BALLOT WHERE THE GOVERNOR CHEERS AMONG ALTERNATES AND TO HAVE A SYSTEM LIKE AN INSTANT RUNOFF OR SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE. CAN HELP PRESERVE MAJORITY WILL- SO JUST KEY POINTS IS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IT WAS DESIGNED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND WHILE IT HAS BEEN RARELY USED- AS WE SEE SIGNS THAT IT MAY BE USED MORE FREQUENTLY MOVING FORWARD. I ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT OF DEEP PARTY POLARIZATION AS WELL AS SOCIAL MEDIA ECHO CHAMBERS OF RAMPANT MISINFORMATION. SECOND MAJOR POINT IS THAT FUTURE RECALL ELECTIONS PARTICULARLY IN STATE LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT EQUITY CONCERNS AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME VOTERS YOUNGER VOTERS. WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INNOVATE AND I'LL TALK ABOUT A FEW WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DO THAT. TWO WEEKS BLAME CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP WHEN IT COMES TO INNOVATION AND GOVERNANCE OUR NATION. MY APOLOGIES FOR ANY NOISE YOU MIGHT HEAR IN THE BACK MY KIDS ARE COMING BACK WITH SCHOOL RECORD. NO WORRIES SO- FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO SIGNATURE GATHERING WE SHOULD IF WE CONSIDER IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY IT IS NOT THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO BUT THE PROPORTION I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST IT BIT BY PREVIOUS SPEAKER. WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE 12% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS THAT CAN ESSENTIALLY FORCE AN ELECTION ON THE REST OF CALIFORNIA- THAT THREATENS THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY AND ITS ABILITY TO GOVERN BASED ON THE KIND OF MANDATE THAT IT PUT IN PLACE IN THE PART OF MUCH. WHAT ALSO MAKES A MOCKERY OF MAJORITY RULE IS OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WHERE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR AN INCUMBENT. WITH 452409% IN FACT JUST ONE VOTE SHY FIFTY PERCENT. TO LOSE. AND TO BE REPLACED BY SOMEONE WITH SUPPORT BELOW 30% THEY'RE ALSO EQUITY CONCERNS ABOUT IT WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF A DROP OFF IN THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION VOTERS. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWELVE POINT NINE MILLION. BUT IN THE CASE OF THE RECALL OF SENATOR NEWMAN. YOU HAD AN ELECTRIC OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND VOTES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND LESS THAN HALF OF THAT HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND VOTES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WE SHOULD BE VERY MINDFUL WHEN YOU HAVE LOW TURNOUT ELECTIONS. VOTERS OF COLOR YOUNG VOTERS LOW INCOME VOTERS TEND TO VOTE AT A DISPROPORTIONATELY LOWER RATE. OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS ALSO ARCHAIC IN THE CURRENT SYSTEM BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INCORPORATE OUR TOP TWO PROCESS WHICH ARE CALIFORNIANS HAVE. HAVE ENJOYED OVER THE PAST DECADE AND THAT ITSELF WAS AN INNOVATION THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE BALLOT NOR DOES IT INCORPORATE INSTANT RUNOFF. ALL RIGHT SO YOU EITHER HAVE THE IF YOU WANT AN INSURER MAJORITY WILL YOU EITHER HAVE A TWO STAGE ELECTION MARK PROFESSOR GALLAGHER IS TALKING ABOUT- BOARDING INSTANT RUN OFF OF ITS A SINGLE ELECTION SO THAT YOU GET A SENSE OF WHAT THE MAJORITY ISN'T THERE IS A KIND OF MAJORITY. MANDATE THAT THE INCUMBENT HAD ENJOYED IN THE PRIOR ELECTION THE CARD SYSTEM AS IT'S DESIGNED DOES NOT DO THAT AND IT NEEDS TO BE REVISED. FINALLY IN THE END MY TO I WOULD SAY PERHAPS MY MOST IMPORTANT POINTS. AND ADVICE TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS SOMETHING I TESTIFIED THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION EARLIER TODAY. IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER IF IT DOES PUT SOMETHING BEFORE THE VOTERS NOT TO PACKAGE EVERYTHING INTO ONE MEASURE AND TO GUESS WHAT THE VOTERS WILL SUPPORT SEVERAL MONTHS DOWN THE LINE. DARLIN MEASURES AND TO GIVE VOTERS THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE THERE ARE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES FIRST OF ALL THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN PUBLIC OPINION ON THOSE PROVISIONS EVEN NOW LET ALONE HEADING TOWARDS ELECTION DAY. VOTERS HATE ONE. ASIAN OR THERE'S A MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN ON ONE PARTICULAR PIECE OF THAT REFORM U. REST SINKING THE ENTIRE EFFORT. SPLITTING IT UP ALSO GIVES VOTERS MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIBERATE AND DECIDE WHICH ASPECTS SEEM TO MAKE THE MOST SENSE SALES SIGNATURE REQUIREMENTS OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE ONE- BALLOT OR TO BALANCE. AND FINALLY IN THE SPIRIT OF NINETEEN ELEVEN WHERE YOU HAVE TWENTY THREE PROVISIONS PUT TOWARDS IT IN FRONT OF VOTERS AND TWENTY TWO OUT OF THOSE TWENTY THREE REFORMS PASSED IF INDEED THERE IS. AN APPETITE FOR REFORM IN CALIFORNIA. WE WILL LIKELY SEE SEVERAL OF THOSE PROVISIONS PASS AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO SOME- ONE ONE SMALL PIECE OF WITHIN A PACKAGE- THAT VOTERS. OPPOSE AN END UP SINKING THE WHOLE MEASURE. FINALLY WE CAN ALSO INUNDATED BY CONSIDERING SUNSET PROVISIONS TO EITHER SOME OR ALL OF THAT IS PUT IN FRONT OF VOTERS. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. WATCHES CALIFORNIA HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. WITH PROPOSITION THIRTY TO HAVE-SUNSET PROVISIONS IN A STATUTORY MEASURE AND THAT APPEALS TO A LOT OF VOTERS TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE TRYING SOMETHING NEW AND YET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BURDEN ALL FUTURE GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS EITHER BADLY DESIGNED OR UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES- THAT CALL FOR A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF INNOVATION TO NOT EXPERIMENT IN A WAY- THAT SADDLES FUTURE GENERATIONS WITH SOMETHING THAT IS ARCHAIC MUCH AS OUR CURRENT RECALL THIS ARCHAIC NOW. AND TO PERHAPS THINK OF SOMETHING LIKE A TEN YEAR OR TWENTY YEAR WINDOW AT WHICH TIME VOTERS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT MORE PERMANENT OR MODIFIED IT ANOTHER WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I LOOK FOR TO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU PROFESSOR LAWMAKERS MEN AND FINALLY WE'LL HEAR FROM BOB STERN- WHO IS THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CENTER FOR GOVERNMENTAL STUDIES. A LOS ANGELES BASED GROUP THAT STUDIED THE GOVERNMENT PROCESS FOR NEARLY THIRTY YEARS MR STERN WAS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR. PROP NINE WHICH WAS PASSED BY 70% OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND ALSO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS THE FIRST GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. ELECTIONS COUNSEL TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND COMMITTEE COUNSEL TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS AND REAFFIRM REAPPORTIONMENT COMMITTEE. MR STERN READY WHEN YOU ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME TODAY IN FOR ACCOMMODATING MY SCHEDULE TO ALLOW ME TO FINISH TEACHING MY CLASS THIS AFTERNOON. CALL POLITICAL POPERY AT UCLA EXTENSION. FOR FIFTY STUDENT SEVERAL OF WHOM ARE MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. I PREVIEW MY REMARKS TO MY CLASS AND RECEIVED SEVERAL COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK FROM MY STUDENTS- I WOULD LIKE TO COME TO SACRAMENTO TO JOIN YOU IN PERSON BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO OBVIOUSLY. WELL YOU KNOW LIKE OUR PHONES. WE NEED TO UPDATE OUR CALIFORNIA'S STATE CONSTITUTION. WHEN SOME OF THESE PROVISIONS NO LONGER MAKE ANY SENSE SOMETIMES WE NEED TO SCRAP OR PHONE AND- NEWMAN. BUT I'M NOT URGING A NEW STATE CONSTITUTION JUSTIN UP TO DATE ONE. I WOULD THINK AND I HOPE WE WERE ALL ALL OF US AGREE. THAT THE SECOND PART OF THE CURRENT RECALL PROCESS NEEDS TO BE DELETED OR SCRAPPED. IN THE NEW PROVISION IS NEEDED. BOB REFER TO THE PART THE CALL FOR ANOTHER. TO REPLACE AGO THAT HAS BEEN RECALLED. RIGHT NOW THIS PROVISION SAYS THAT WHOEVER GETS THE MOST VOTES IN THIS SECTION ELECTION BECOMES GOVERNOR. EVEN IF THAT PERSON RECEIVES FAR LESS MAJORITY. FOR EXAMPLE THE ELECTION HELD IN SEPTEMBER FOURTEENTH THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM BEEN RECALLED. LARRY ELDER WOULD BECOME GOVERNOR EVEN THOUGH HE ONLY RECEIVED TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL VOTES CAST IN THE ELECTION OR FORTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF THE VOTES CAST BY PEOPLE VOTING IN THE SECOND PART OF THE ELECTION. SO THE GOVERNOR'S AND COULD BE SEEN RECALLED. WELL I ONLY GOT. 28% OF THE VOTE IN BECOME GOVERNOR. MY RECOMMENDATION HAVE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BECOME GOVERNOR IF THE GOVERNOR'S RECALL. THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ALREADY HAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ASSUMING THE GOVERNORSHIP IF THE GOVERNOR DIES IN OFFICE RESIGNS OR OTHERWISE VACATES HIS HER OFF HER OFFICE. MY REFORM WOULD MEAN THAT WE MOST LIKELY ONLY HAVE A GUBERNATORIAL RECALL WHEN THE GOVERNOR IS CORRUPT SENILE OR INCOMPETENT BECAUSE WHY WOULD PEOPLE OBJECTING TO THE GOVERNOR'S POLICIES BOTHER TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR IF THE TENANT GOVERNOR WAS GOING TO TAKE OVER. BY THE WAY CALIFORNIA ALSO HIS IMPEACHMENT PROVISIONS WHICH APPARENTLY HAVE NEVER BEEN USED THAT LAYS OUT THE FOLLOWING UPON THE ASSEMBLY IMPEACHING THE GOVERNOR EVEN WHILE AWAITING TRIAL IN THE STATE SENATE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BECOMES GOVERNOR UPON CONVICTION IN THE SENATE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BECOMES PART OF THE GOVERNOR. YEAH THERE IS ONE PROBLEM WITH MY RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND WHAT IF WE TELL THE GOVERNOR IS A MEMBER OF THE OTHER PARTY THAT COULD ENCOURAGE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR'S PARTY TO PROMOTE RECALL YOU MIGHT SAY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT BUT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF THE OTHER PARTY FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS AS RECENTLY AS ONE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAS GOVERNOR. WE HAD MY CARBON REPUBLICAN WHO IS- WHO TENDED TO JERRY BROWN WAS A GOVERNOR IN THE SEVENTIES WE HAVE YOUR CAR KEYS DEMOCRAT JANET GOVERNOR GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN WAS GOVERNOR OF THE EIGHTIES WE HAD GRAY DAVIS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WHO'S A DEMOCRAT WAS WELL GOOD WILSON WAS GOVERNOR IN THE NINETIES AND THEN WE HAD. THE TALENT GOVERNOR JOHN GARAMENDI THE DEMOCRAT WHO WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR ONE SHORTS **** FROM RESIGNED TO BECOME A MEMBER OF CONGRESS SCHWARZENEGGER THEN SHOWS ABEL MALDONADO TO BE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. SOME SORT OF TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM I RECOMMEND THAT THE GOVERNOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR RUN TOGETHER AS A TEAM JUST AS THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT DO WHAT IF YOU DON'T ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL PLEASE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT STOPS. THE CANDIDATE WITH LESS IT'S THE MAJORITY OF BECAUSE GOVERNOR. IF THEY DON'T HAVE. BUT PEOPLE WOULD WRITE BE VERY UPSET WITH HIS WORK PROCESS THE CA HAVE BEEN PER BUT WHY YOU SEE I HOPE THEY YOU WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THESE PER I HOPE YOU DO SOME. BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I THINK THAT WE RESTORE IN THE SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE NOTHING WACKY HAPPENS IN THE FUTURE THANKS SO MUCH. THANK YOU MR STERN REALLY APPRECIATE THAT SO LET'S OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS. AND COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES WITH A REMINDER THAT I BELIEVE IT'S- PROFESSOR LEVINSON AND PROFESSOR RAMAKRISHNAN WHO HAVE TO LEAVE AT HAVE A HEART STOP pPREFERENCE TO THEM- ON ON QUICKLY REPLYING AND FOR THE PANELISTS I DON'T HAVE A LAPTOP IN FRONT OF ME I CAN'T SEE REYES HANDS OF SORT OF KIND OF CHIME IN- IF YOU WANT TO ANSWER TO A QUESTION AND WE'LL FIND A WAY TO KIND OF KEEP IT ORDERLY- BUT ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES INVESTORS HERE DON'T. I DO HAVE. SEVERAL OF CHINA ORGANIZE AND BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT CAME OUT HERE- FIRST FOR DOCTOR COME A CHRISTIAN MAN THANK YOU FOR POINTING OUT THE IF WE DO DO AN ACA. YOU KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE SEVERAL DIFFERENT ASPECTS TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PACKAGE AS A- AS AN AMENDMENT. AND PEOPLE NEED THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY MADE LIKE A COUPLE OF PROVISIONS BUT NOT THE OTHER TWO. AND BE PUT BACK INTO THIS POSITION OF VOTING FOR SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THEY DO WANT. AND WE WIND UP WITH A ANOTHER PROCESS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT NOT HAPPY WITH- DOCTORS. TURNED THAT SEE WE- HAVE COME BACK TO YOU IN A MINUTE. THE MS LEVINSON. QUALIFICATIONS THIS LEVINSON STILL ON. YEP OKAY SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS AND I THINK. IN THE LAST GOVERNOR GOVERNOR'S RACE IN THE PRIMARY WE HAD WITH THIRTY ONE CANDIDATES. TO CHOOSE FROM WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR BEING IT'S A GOVERNOR. YEAH HOW DO WE DETERMINE QUALIFICATIONS. SO WE DETERMINE QUALIFICATIONS IT'S A ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE WEBSITE I CAN SEND IT AROUND IT'S BASICALLY BE A U. S. CITIZEN BE A REGISTERED VOTER I DON'T BE CONVICTED OF CERTAIN FELONIES- AND DON'T BE TURNED OUT BASICALLY DON'T HAVE ALREADY SERVED TWO TERMS IN OFFICE AND THEN THERE ARE SOME REQUIREMENTS ABOUT CAMPAIGN FILINGS FILING FEES- AT BALLOT DESIGNATION STATEMENT OF ECONOMIC INTEREST- AND THOSE ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS RIGHT IN NONE OF THOSE AND OTHER PEOPLE SIGNED UP FOR EITHER THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN THE ORIGINAL TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. ELECTION OR OR THIS RECALL RACE LACKED THOSE QUALIFICATIONS OTHERWISE IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE BALLOT CORRECT. RIGHT THEY'LL BE KICKED OFF THE BAT RIGHT SO YOU KNOW WHEN I HESITATE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO HAVE QUALIFICATIONS FOR ONE. AND NOT QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE OTHER IF LIKE YOU HAD SAID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FOR EVERYBODY. AND AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL. THING- THE MAJORITY RULE VERSUS SUPERMAJORITY RULES ANOTHER DOCTOR COMIC CHRIS DEMAND. THING I'M A CHRISTIAN THANK YOU. SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN GOVERNANCE WHEN YOU HAVE YEAH AND I YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE INTEREST OF BLOOD ESSENCE EVERYBODY'S BEING BLACK ALL RIGHT I'M NOT ONE OF NINETEEN REPUBLICANS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- IN THE SENATE I BELIEVE. MISTAKE CENTER TO NIELSEN IS ONE OF NINE SENATORS BOTH OF THOSE ARE 75% SUPERMAJORITY- WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT. WHETHER THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE. CHECKS AND BALANCES WHEN THE GOVERNOR IS SUPER ALIGNED WITH THE SUPER MAJORITIES. AND THEN THE. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IS MOST MORE THAN LIKELY THIS THE SAME DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT PLAY INTO WHY PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR A CHANGE BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES SUPERMAJORITIES THAT I'VE FOUND DON'T GOVERN THE SAME WAY AS A SIMPLE MAJORITY AND I LOOK TO OUR PURPLE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE AND WHAT THOSE CANDIDATES GO THROUGH DURING THEIR ELECTION PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO NON PURPLE DISTRICTS. AND IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO. DAY IN THE PURPLE DISTRICTS ACTUALLY HAVE TO. ANSWER TO THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH ALL OF THEIR- THERE ARE BELIEVED THEY CAN'T JUST DISREGARD THEM. IN A SUPERMAJORITY CASE A LOT OF TIMES LOT OF THE ELECTORATE IS JUST SIMPLY DISREGARDED. AND WHEN YOU DISREGARD THEM YEAH THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNHAPPY AND THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO EXPRESS THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THINGS DURING AN ELECTION. AND THEN AFTER THE ELECTION EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS WITH THE CANDIDATE THEY SAID HEY YOU KNOW YOU TOLD US YOU WERE GOING TO OVERTURN THE DEATH PENALTY AND THEN DESPITE TWO INITIATIVES THAT SAID. WE'RE GOOD WE ARE WE AS A STATE ARE GOOD WITH THE DEATH PENALTY. YOU DON'T WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU DO IS GET EXECUTIVE POWER TO OVERTURN THEDEATH PENALTY. SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT KIND OF SITUATION. THE ONLY THING LEFT IS THIS. IS OUR OUR CITIZENS ABILITY TO DO A RECALL. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE'S A DIFFERENCE AND MAJORITY RULE VERSUS SUPERMAJORITY RULE. AND SORRY MY QUESTION TO THAT THE DOCTOR WAS. DO YOU SEE THAT OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S INVALID. THANK YOU- YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO. AB DE VOTERS HAVING A CHOICE FOR PUNISHING ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY WHAT REELECTIONS ARE FOR- IN THE CASE OF THE ASSEMBLY EVERY TWO YEARS IN THE SENATE EVERY EVERY FOUR YEARS- IT IS. IN A MAJORITIES DO HAVE. NOT ONLY THE RIGHT BUT THE OBLIGATION TO GOVERN- AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE INTENDED THE RECALL PROVISION TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR WHATEVER- VOTING RULES WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE RECALL IS THEREFORE- AND IF CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANTED TO. CREATE SOME OTHER MECHANISM TO ENSURE- THAT MINORITY INTERESTS ARE REPRESENTED- THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. OF DOING IT GIVING I WOULD SAY IS AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF REFORMS TO BE MADE. TO REALLY TAKE THE LONG VIEW RIGHT- SO ARE RECALL SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN IT'S STILL IN PLACE AND THERE'S ANXIETY THAT IS BEING USED FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF PURPOSES THAT. WILL REGIONALLY INVISION AND WHATEVER REFORMS WE DO SHOULD NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE PARTY OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE PARTY THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THE PARTY IF THE LEGISLATURE. WITH RESPECT TO THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR- AUTOMATICALLY GOING INTO A PROCESS AUTOMATICALLY. FILLING A VACANCY ON THE GOVERNOR'S RECALLED. I WOULD URGE CAUTION. AGAIN RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO FROM THE SAME PARTY. IMAGINE A SCENARIO MABILLE FACTIONS WITHIN PARTIES WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THATCOMES FROM THE PARTICULARLY VOCAL FACTION WITHIN THE SAME PARTY. AND IS ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HANDS CLEAN AND LET OTHER PEOPLE DO THE DIRTY WORK OF JUST GETTING ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND TO HAVE A VERY PASSIONATE MINORITY NOT A MINORITY PARTY. BUT APASSIONATE MINORITY WITHIN A MAJORITY PARTY. TO GET THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GOVERNOR INSTALLED. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I. WE HAVE TO BE THINKING NOT ONLY ABOUT OUR CURRENT POLITICAL LANDSCAPE BUT THE LANDSCAPE I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE A SUNSET PROVISION AND IF YOU HAVE A SUCH A PROVISION. YOU pPARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT MAYBE FOR THE NEXT DECADE. WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS SEVENTY YEARS HUNDRED YEARS- WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT REFORMS THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME AND NOT BASED ON. WHAT THE WHAT THE PARTIES LOOK LIKE OR EVEN WHAT OUR CURRENT ASSET OF ELECTED OFFICIALS LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU I WISH WE COULD DO THAT BUT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE- AND WHAT I SEE IS A VERY POLITICALLY DIVIDED NOT JUST TO. CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO IN THE NATION SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWERS TO THOSE AND YOUR OPINION ON THAT THANK. EVA'S RESTAURANT- CENTER HERTZBERG. JUST FOR PURPOSES QUESTION ON A FOLLOW UP IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU KNOW TO JUST YOU KNOW WHEN I RAN FOR THIS OFFICE IN YOUR HOUSE THE OTHER PARTY WAS IN POWER- WE TEND TO LOOK AT HISTORY IN THE SHORTEST PERIOD OF TIME AT ONE POINT SEVENTY TWO MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY WERE OF ONE PARTY THOSE ARE THE REPUBLICANS AGAINST EIGHT MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATS. THESE THINGS SHIFT WE TEND TO WATCH SO I JUST ALL I COULD YOU SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT I THANK GOODNESS YOU BY TAKING THE LONG VIEW I JUST WANTED TO CHECK A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS ON THE- BOB STERN WHO'S ON OF THIS CLOSE MISTER CHAIRMAN BOTH GERMANIZED TO SIT ON HIS BOARD WE WORKED TOGETHER MANY TIMES HONDURAS ISSUES. BUT BUT TERM. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN IN IN IN PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEMS LOOK WHAT HAPPENED THE PRESIDENT I'D STATES LOOK AT THE EARLY. HISTORY OF CAL OF UNITED STATES. WHERE THE VICE FOR THE SECOND RUNNER UP BECAME THE VICE PRESIDENT. AND YOU DO HAVE THOSE CHALLENGESAND I DON'T KNOW. B. SO INSIDIOUS THAT THEIR MOTIVATION WOULD BE TO TAKE OUT THE GOVERNOR. BUT I'M I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO THINKS THAT THE IDEA THAT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SHOULD TAKE OVER I THINK IS A SERIES OF POLITICAL ISSUES AS TO WHY THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE. I DO AGREE WITH WHAT STERN SAID. PROFESSOR STERN SAID ABOUT. ALL OF THE OTHER INDICIA OF THE CONSTITUTION AS TO WHERE THIS DUE TO THE GOVERNOR STEPS IN BUT I THINK OF THE RECALL SITUATION IS SO FRAUGHT. THAT IT'S PROBLEMATIC AND- AND IN IN MY SENSE. I APOLOGIZE I WASN'T HERE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. BUT CLEARLY THE IDEA OF TRYING TO MERGE INTO ONE ELECTION. RATHER THAN THE TWO SEPARATE EECTIONS SOLVES A LOT OF THAT BIG PART OF THE PROBLEM BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT. FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES THAT IS NOT ALWAYS ONE PARTY THAT'S IN CONTROL. THAT THAT THESE THINGS TO SHIFT OVER TIME- AND THAT I DO AGREE WITH YOU AS WE GRAPPLE WITH THIS SUCH THAT. OF BOTH COMMITTEE CHAIRS. THAT WE DO TAKE THE LONG VIEW. AND AND TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A LONG TERM FIX ON SOMETHING THAT HAS- EARLY NOT IN NOT ACHIEVED ITS- PURPOSE WHEN IT WAS- PROPOSED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN ALONG WITH THE OTHER SERIES OF REFORMS IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG. MR NELSON J. GLAZER- NO QUESTIONS I DID I'VE GOT A LOT OF NOTES AND A LOT OF THOUGHTS THESE ARE IS REALLY I THINK FASCINATING IDEAS SOME OF THEM CONTRADICTORY SO THANKS FOR- DUMPING THAT INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE ON US- BUT BUT THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THIS EFFORT- IS TO YEAH WE HEAR FROM EXPERTS ON WHO HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS AND OPINIONS- ON ON WHAT'S IMPOSSIBLE REFORM SHOULD BE AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO- KIND OF HASH THEM OUT AND- FIGURE OUT WHAT MIGHT BE PALATABLE AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED TWO. OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC AND I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT WE CAN'T PACKAGE THIS ALL INTO ONE MEASURE- OR ELSEWHERE WILL PROBABLY GUARANTEED TO TAKE THE WHOLE THING- SO APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S COMMENTS- AND WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- PART OF THE AGENDA. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH- EVERYBODY FOR THE- THE PANELISTS FOR PARTICIPATING. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC TESTIMONY. AS A REMINDER WE HAVE SET ASIDE ONE HOUR FOR PUBLIC COMMENT STARTING WITH MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CORE HERE IN THE ROOM. EACH PERSON WILL HAVE ONE MINUTE TO MAKE YOUR REMARKS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE DURING THIS PORTION OF THE AGENDA OR WHO HAVE.

LOT OF MRS SOME SHINS TODAY THE- THAT WHAT THE BECAUSE HOW IT WAS DONE AND THE REASON IT WAS STAR IN THE- ABOUT IT I WOULD REALLY THE K. TO HAVE US BACK TO. HAVE A DISK WITH THE WHAT REALLY FROM THE PEAK POINT OF VIEW FIRST THE PLEDGE POINTS OF VIEW THAT I'VE HEARD DISCUSSED TODAY. ALSO LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT THE MORE PEOPLE VOTE THE HIGHER THE BAR GOES ANYWAY SO WHAT'S 12% OF THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR GOVERNOR LAST TIME. THE OBJECTIVE SHOULD BE TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO COME OUT AND VOTE ALSO PER WHAT. THE ESTIMATE- DOCTOR WEBER SAID EARLIER SHE DID HAVE A SHORTER TIME TO PREPARE FOR THE ELECTION THAT WAS THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE CHANGING THE RULES. SO IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF SELF INFLICTED. LET'S OPEN UP THE DIALOGUE AND GET THE PROPONENTS BACK IN TO TALK. TO THE EXPERTS WILL PROBABLY NEVER ACTUALLY CONDUCTED A RECALL AS WE DID IN COLLECTING TWO POINT ONE MILLION SIGNATURES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I BELIEVE. WE ARE CAN YOU COME BACK FOR JUST ONE SECOND. SIR WE DESERVE IT- CHAIR GLAZER HAS A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU I KNOW IT'S NOT A PRACTICE TO ASK QUESTIONS IN THIS POINT ABOUT K. LOOK AT I WANTED JUST TO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. I THINK THE PURPOSE OF OUR HEARING WASN'T TO TALK ABOUT THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE RECALL THAT REALLY WASN'T WHERE WE'RE GOING. IS REALLY MORE OF A STRUCTURAL ISSUE OF FAIRNESS IN THAT REGARD BUT I LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLECTING. TWO POINT ONE MILLION SIGNATURES IS THAT RIGHT. YES ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION OF THEM COLLECTED BY VOLUNTEERS. AND WELL UNDER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND COLLECTED BY PAID PETITIONERS RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THAT ON THE RECORD BECAUSE THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER. IN TERMS OF WHAT ACTUALLY DID HAPPEN. IN THE RECALL IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE CURE COSTS FOR SEVEN DOLLARS A SIGNATURE SIR COULD YOU. CLARIFY WHAT YOU FELT THAT COSTSWERE COMBINED VOLUNTEERS AND PAID PER SIGNATURE FOR THE ENCOUNTERS WERE NOT PAID ALL THE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THE LATER DATE I'M HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW. WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS OKAY NO PROBLEM THANK YOU SIR THANKS FOR COMING IN. IT IS VERY HELPFUL THAT TO THANK YOU. BRIDGETTE WILL BE HAPPY TO CLARIFY THAT LATER I WOULD APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- NEXT BIGGER PLEASE. YES YES. MY NAME IS OREN HEATLEY ON THE LEAD PROPONENT I'M THE ONE THAT PUT THE TEAM TOGETHER THAT BROUGHT THE RECALL TO THE BALLOT FOR THE RECALLING GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK TODAY ABOUT. THE BECAUSE- AND THE REASONS- TO- SHOW YOU KNOW. TO PUT THAT TOWARDS THE END RECALLING THE GOVERNOR. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE CAUSE OR THE REASONS FOR RECALLING THE GOVERNOR IS LISTED ON EVERY PETITION THAT CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT'S NOT YOUR DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE RECALL OR WHETHER OR NOT IT'S SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH. TO GIVE BECAUSE TO THE RECALL IT'S UP TO THE PEOPLE THERE'S A REASON IT'S ON THE PETITION THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOOK IT OVER THEY HAVE THE ABILITY. TO REVIEW THE CAUSE AND THE REASONS BEHIND IT THE RECALL AND IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE IN THE FIELD AND YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME I'M NOT A I'M NOT A POLITICIAN I'M NOT A PUBLIC SPEAKER. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY BUT ARTICLE TWO SECTION FOURTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THE REASONS FOR THE RECALL ARE LISTED ON EVERY PETITION. AND IT'S UP TO THE PUBLIC TO DECIDE THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE RECALL IS NOT REVIEW OF ALL FOR A REASON BECAUSE THEY WANT YOUR HANDS. OUT OF THE PROCESS THIS IS A PROCESS OF THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE THIS IS A PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE TO RECALL GOVERNMENT GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. NEXT BIGGER. MY NAME IS ERIC EARLY AS THE LEAD LAWYER FOR THE RECALL IN ONE OF THE CANDIDATES FOR CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL BE QUICK. ONE OF THE CO CHAIR SAID THIS PROCESS WAS UNDEMOCRATIC THIS WAS ACTUALLY ONE THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. SAID THAT THIS WAS A FUNDAMENTALLY SMALL THRESHOLD OF VOTES YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH THOSE TWO GENTLEMEN AND FIND OUT WHAT A HERCULEAN EFFORT IT WAS. THERE'S A REASON WHY THIS WAS ONLY THE FOURTH STATEWIDE RECALL ELECTION THEY GOT THIS FAR AND ONLY TWO OF THOSE. HAVE ENDED EVER ENDED UP ON THE BALLOT SOMEBODY SAID. ABOUT THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR COST WE WON'T MAKE LIGHT OF THAT COST BUT THE OUTRAGE SHOULD BE SAVED. FOR THE STOLEN THIRTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE D. D. FUNDS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN NO BID CONTRACTS PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS RECALL GOT. CERTIFIED SOMEBODY SAID THEY SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS IN THIS DAY AND ARE CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY ONE PARTY RULE SHOULD NOT BE WORKING TO CHANGE THIS PROVISION THAT PROTECTS THE PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA'S CONSTITUTION. SOMEBODY SAID IT FAILED SPECTACULARLY. LOOK AT THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS RAISED BY NEWS INVERSE THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS RAISED BY EVERYBODY ELSE THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE. THE LINE OF SUCCESSION ISSUE. THAT WOULD COMPLETELY UNDERCUT THIS RECALL BECAUSE NOBODY WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS HERCULEAN EFFORT THESE SIGNATURES NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN OBTAINED IF A MOUTH PIECE LIKE THE PRESENT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE JOB NEXT- ON AND ON. LISTEN TO VICE CHAIR NIELSEN AND LISTEN TO EXPERT AT CARILLO HUNDRED TEN YEARS THIS IS VERY SACRED. THIS IS DIMMITT DIRECT DEMOCRACY IN ACTION AND AS FAR AS THE MAJORITY VOTE ISSUE IT TAKES A MAJORITY OF YESES ON QUESTION NUMBER ONE TO FIRE THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A MAJORITY VOTE YOU NEED A MAJORITY OF YESS OVER THE NUMBER OF NODES THANK YOU FOR NOT BE TOUCHING THIS THIS SECTION FONG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FIVE MORE SECONDS BEFORE FOR ONE THING A QUICK QUICK FIVE SECONDS I'M I I'M THE ONE THAT FILED THE RECALL PAPERWORK I FILED TWO. ATTEMPTS TO RECALL THE GOVERNOR ONE WAS WAS DISMISSED DUE TO A PROCEDURAL ERROR. BUT THAT'S STILL LISTED. AS A RECALL ATTEMPT I WAS LOOKS NOW I'D LIKE WE GET WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO RECALL GOVERNOR HE- CONTINUALLY SAYS THERE'S BEEN SIX ATTEMPTS AGAINST HIM. THERE'S ONLY BEEN THREE ATTEMPTS AND I JUST WANNA PUT IT ON RECORD. I TOLD IN THREE ATTEMPTS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN APPROVED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE TO CIRCULATE PETITIONS IN CALIFORNIA. MY NAME'S WARREN HE LEAVE I SUBMITTED A WRITTEN TESTIMONY AND I'D LIKE AT RISK READ INTO RECORD PLACE TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE WRITTEN TESTIMONY- IT WILL BE A PART OF THE RECORD IS AVAILABLE I BELIEVE ON THE WEBSITE- WELL IT'S.

THOSE WHO ALREADY WALK SUBMISSIVE LEE WILL SAY THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR ALARM. BUT SUBMISSIVENESS IS NOT OUR HERITAGE. THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS DESIGNED TO ALLOW REBELLION TO REMAIN AS OUR HERITAGE THE CONSTITUTION WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP GOVERNMENT OFF THE BACKS OF THE PEOPLE. THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS ADDED TO KEEP THE PRECINCTS OF BELIEF AND EXPRESSION THE PRESS. OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES FREE FROM SURVEILLANCE. THE BILL OF RIGHTS WAS DESIGNED TO KEEP AGENTS OF GOVERNMENT AN OFFICIAL EAVESDROPPERS AWAY FROM THE ASSEMBLIES OF PEOPLE. THE AIM WAS TO ALLOW MEN TO BE FREE AND INDEPENDENT.

WHEN YOUR SMALL MINORITY FORCING ALSO ALEXION WITH A VERY LOW TURNOUT AMONG UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS ASSEMBLY EXACERBATE CALIFORNIA'S PRE EXISTING CRISIS OF REPRESENTATION. FOR A FEW OBSERVATIONS FROM THIS BILL THE PROCESS IS VERY CONFUSING VOTERS WEREN'T SURE IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CHOOSE A REPLACEMENT CANDIDATE IF THEY VOTED NO ON THE FIRST QUESTION. WE THINK THAT THIS CONGESTION ALONG WITH THE NO CAMPAIGN STRATEGY REALLY CONTRIBUTED. TO THE QUESTION SHE WONDERED. WHICH IS NO BAD. WE HEARD DEEP. ABOUT BEING NOT BEING ON THE COUPLED WITH FACT THAT IT'S CLEAR TO MAJORITY. THAT COULD BE WHY BY A VERY SMALL OUT THAT WOULD VERY DISTURBING. AND IN OUR COMMENTS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER AMONG THINGS.

TO US THAT THIS IS NOT A CONTINUED POWER GRABBED BY BOATS IN POWER WE CALL OUR WHITE FINISHERS THE POWER OF THE PEOPLE. TO APPOINT A REPLACEMENT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR KNOCK IS JOKE TWICE IN THE FACE OF THE PURPOSE OF THE RECALL. THE SECOND LARGEST MOLD IN THE PREVIOUS ELECTION SHOULD BE A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION. AND AT THE- END OF THE PEOPLE KNOWINGLY CHOOSE THIS FORM RECALL. IN THE MAJORITY VOTE IS REPRESENTATIVE. I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING. WRONG POLICE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE CHAIRS AND VICE CHAIRS I'M HERE TODAY IN MY PERSONAL CAPACITY HOWEVER I DO SERVE MY COMMUNITY AS AN ELECTED TRUSTEE FOR CUPERTINO UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HAVE ALSO FACED CHIU SERIAL RECALL ATTEMPTS THIS YEAR I BELIEVE IN THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE TO USE RECALL ELECTED TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES BUT IT IS A VOTER RIGHTS ISSUE THAT THE BROAD DEFINITION OF RECALL FOR ANY REASON RIGHT NOW. MEANS THAT THE PETITIONS THAT ARMENIAN COMPLIED AND BLATANTLY FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION TO VOTERS ALL OF MY NEEDS BECAUSE SHE ISN'T THE ONLY INTENT FILING IN WEAPONIZING ONE IS LOCAL RECALL TO BECOME TOOLS IN THE ARSENAL USED BY SOME TO DESTRUCTIVE. DISRUPT STRICT BUSINESS BLUDGEON REPUTATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND INTIMIDATE AND HARASS THE ELECTED TRUSTEES WHO ARE I'D REFER YOU TO ARTICLE TWO SECTION ONE OF THE STATE CONSTITUTION STATING THAT SUFFICIENT THE REASON FOR RECALL IS NOT WORTH THE OVERALL AND ELECTION CODE ELEVEN- TO FOR THAT SUBSTANCE COULD NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF A RECALL PETITION. SO WHAT ALTHOUGH OTHER BALLOT AND VOTER INFORMATION POINTS IN THE SYSTEM PROVIDED TO VOTERS- THEY ARE PROTECTED FROM FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION RECALL IS NOT PROPONENTS CAN SAY LITERALLY ANYTHING THEY WANT AND IT WILL BE LEGITIMIZED APPEARING BOTH ON THE OFFICIAL PETITION AND INFORMATION MAILED TO VOTERS WITH A BALLOT. GREAT IF WE CAN ELEVATE RECALL TO THE TRUE MEASURE OF MALFEASANCE IF NOT WE STARTED A MINIMUM OF PROTECTING VOTERS AND OUR DEMOCRACY BY ADDRESSING FALSE INFORMATION IN THE. REFORM pTHANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE COLOR. NEXT TO NUMBER TWENTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME RICHARD BY AND I AM A- I IN CLASS COUNTY- I JUST WANTTO TOUCH ON A CO THINGS IT WAS THAT- ONE- THERE WAS A WORD USUALLY GUYS WERE OUR- WHETHER IT WAS LEGAL OR YOU KNOW MORAL WHAT IS IT THAT THE- DID THAT PERSON. THAT STATUS IS WITH WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD THEY BE RECALLED FOR AND- I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT WAS ON THE BALLOT WHEN THE BALLOT WENT THROUGH BECAUSE WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE THAT COULD BE ADDED THAT BALLOT- BUT I DO BELIEVE IT YOU KNOW MORALLY IF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING THAT'S AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WELL WE'RE ALLOWED TO POINT THAT OUT- SCHOOL TEACHER AND SHE DOES A NATIVE AMERICAN DANCE. AS A REFERENCE OR THE KIDS SHE COULD GET CAN- THERE FOR THE PEOPLE IN POWER SHOULD SHOULD WATCH WHAT THEY DO IT THEY'RE GONNA ASK PEOPLE TO CLOSE THEIR BUSINESSES DOWN OR CLOSE THEIR COUNTING DOWN. THEY SHOULDN'T. IT SHOULDN'T KEEP THEIR- OPEN SO REGARD IF IT'S LEAGUE OR NOT WHEN YOU'RE- EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE IN YOUR AND YOU CAN KEEP PUSHING AND PUSHING. I THINK THERE COMES A POINT THAT YEAH. YOU'RE REGARDLESS IF IT'S LEGAL OR ILLEGAL. YOU SHOULD BE RECALL THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE GOT THAT'S THE ONLY THING WE HAVE AND LIKE I SAID.

PLEASE GO AHEAD RIGHT. ALL RIGHT I'M A WRAP UP RIGHT NOW LIKE I SAID IF WE GET IT RIGHT NOW THERE'D BE A LOT MORE SO I DON'T CARE IF IT'S LEGALLY OR ILLEGAL THAT'S IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CALLER PLEASE. NEXT WOULD ALIGN FORTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS HENRY FONG- I'M A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT I FIND A RECALL PETITION I ALSO WORK AT THE LECTERN WORKER- IN THE LA AREA WHERE I LIVE ALTHOUGH OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THEM- IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE AT THE RECALL OF THE VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MALFEASANCE ISSUE AND ALSO IF YOU REALLY WANT JUDGES TO DETERMINE WHETHER RECALL COULD QUALIFY IF IT ENDS UP YOU KNOW CREATING MORE ISSUES THAT NOT SO I LOOK AT IT LET'S MAKE IT A VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE LET THE- HAVE. YOU KNOW MAYBE SHORTEN THE PERIOD I THINK THAT THE GOOD POINT NINETY DAYS I THINK IT'S FINE HOW LIKE A REFERENDUM BECAUSE REFERENDUMS THAT REQUIRED NINETY DAYS QUALIFY ONLY NINETY DAYS AND I THINK I RECALL NINETY DAYS THAT THEY COULD FIND- I LIKE A PROFESSOR ROBERT CHRISTIAN ON THE IDEA. WITH HAVING WON THE ELECTION AND THEN DOING A RUN OFF AFTERWARDS BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT TAKES A LONG FOR HELPING TO SERVE BY ELECTIONS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO PREPARE FOR NEXT ELECTION CO THAT GAP. IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LONG NINETY DAYS MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO LONG I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DO A STATEWIDE SPECIAL IN THE RUN OFF- SO QUICKLY- LIKE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO AND ALSO- ONE IDEA THAT I HAVE A PART THAT MIGHT BE OUT OF THE BOXES WITH THE RECALL WHETHER IT THE OLDER PASSES IN EXTENT SOMEBODY'S TERM TWO YEARS. SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY JUST STARTED OUT THE NEW GOVERNOR AND THEY HAVE TO GO ELECTION IN LIKE EIGHT OR NINE MONTHS THEY HAVE TWO YEARS TO DO ANY OLD GREW UP PEOPLE LIKE WILL IT MIGHT YOU KNOW MESSED UP WITH THE CYCLE OF ELECTION BUT I THINK GIVING THEM A MINIMUM TERM OF TWO YEARS WOULD BE GOOD.

I THAT LEAD MAJORITY OF THE STATE BY COLLECTED WHERE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR NEWS THEM SO THIS HEARING ALLOWING.

HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. HI MY NAME IS PETER AND I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO I WANNA BRING UP ONE POINT THAT AND GOT LOST EARLIER WHEN WITNESSES WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SIGNATURE THRESHOLD IN CALIFORNIA VERSUS THAT IN OTHER STATES SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WERE BRINGING UP THAT THE WRONG NUMBER IS HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR LARGER POPULATION. I POINT OUT THAT OUR LARGER POPULATION ALSO MEANS PROPONENTS WOULD HAVE MORE POTENTIAL SIGNATURE GATHERERS WHICH BALANCES OUT THE HIGHER NUMBER OF SIGNATURES TO GATHER. THE THRESHOLD SHOULD BE BASED ON PERCENTAGE AND IT SHOULD BE INCREASED TO BE SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES WE CALL IT IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR WHEN SOMEONE'S PRESENTLY IN OFFICE IS AN EMERGENCY IN THAT SITUATION THE PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM FINDING ONE QUARTER OF VOTERS IN NINETY DAYS TO SUPPORTER RECALL RECALL IS NOT FOR POLICY DIFFERENCES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT REGULAR ELECTION. I ALSO SUPPORT OTHER REFORMS SUCH AS SENATOR ALAN S. C. H. THREE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE INCUMBENT TO APPEAR AMONG THE CANDIDATES FOR REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS RANKED CHOICE WHICH WE USE IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS AND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT ENABLING. THE PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR WILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT- COLOR. NEXT TO AN OLD NUMBER FORTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER AND I'M A CONCERNED CITIZEN OF CALIFORNIA I POSED THE CHANGING OF THE RECALL LAW AND THEY FEEL IT WOULD MAKE THE FUTURE RECALLS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PUBLIC WHEN THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ACTION. I UNDERSTAND ALREADY IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO OBTAIN A RECALL BUT IF YOU MAKE IT HADER YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY TAKING AWAY PUBLIC FOR. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE THANK YOU TO THE GROUP. ORGANIZED THREE CALL TWO POINT ONE MILLION SIGNATURES. ARE YOU KIDDING ME. AND ONE POINT SEVEN OF THEM BEING FROM VOLUNTEERS THAT'S AMAZING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CALLERS. BUT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE GREAT SO WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE DOWN AT THE- IT TELEPHONE TESTIMONY PART OF TODAY'S HEARING WE DO HAVE A- AN ADDITIONAL A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WOULDLIKE TO TESTIFY PLEASE SIR- GO RIGHT AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR BEING GRACIOUS TO ALLOW ME THIS TIME. MY NAME IS CAROL WEBER AND I'M A FORMER CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES- AS A DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKER I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE DRUNK ON POWER FOR SIX THEIR OWN PEOPLE. WHAT HAPPENS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE HAVE A STATE LEGISLATURE HAS A VETO PROOF 75% DEMOCRATS SUPERMAJORITY. IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY ON THE STATE SENATE AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS HOLDING ALL SIX STATE SEATS FROM GOVERNOR ALL THE WAY DOWN TO INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THAT. ANYTIME THAT YOU HAND OFF EXECUTIVE POWER TO SEE THE GOVERNOR FOR THEM TO RULE BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. YOU ARE NOW CREATING A SITUATION OF ENABLEMENT. AND WE'VE SEEN THIS HAPPEN ACROSS THE WORLD WHAT WERE YOU CENTRALIZE POWER. THAT CENTRALIZED POWER CAN BE ABUSED WHEN THAT CENTRALIZED POWER IS ABUSED IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE CITIZENS LIVING WITHIN THAT AREA THAT IS BEING GOVERNED. TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE. BECAUSE THERE IS NO REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATION THAT CAN PUSH BACK AGAINST ALL ODDS ARE AGAINST EXECUTIVE ORDERS THAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SOME MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER IS THE ELECTED EXECUTIVE IN. CALIFORNIA THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEIR JOB IS ALWAYS UNDER THREAT AND THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THREATENED OF LOSING THEIR JOB. BECAUSE THE MOMENT THAT NO ONE FEELS SCARED ABOUT LOSING THEIR JOB. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO TERRORIZE THEIR OWN PEOPLE PLEASE ROUTE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK. YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO CONCLUDES THE PUBLIC COMMENT PART OF THE OF THE HEARING- VICE OUT CHAIR GLAZER. YEAH LET'S MOVE ON A CLOSING COMMENTS RIGHT AT YOUR BERMAN THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY A COUPLE THINGS ONE I WANT TO THANK THE STAFF YOUR STAFF AND OUR STAFF IN THE SENATE FOR THE GREAT- HISTORICAL- ANALYSIS OF THE FACTS THAT HAVE REALLY CREATED THE BASIS FOR THIS IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK TO TEACHER BERMAN YOUR WORK- TO BRING A REAL BREATH OF- OF FOLKS TO THIS HEARING ROOM TODAY THROUGH THEM FOR THE MOST PART- TO ACTING TO BRING EXPERTISE FROM REPUBLICANS FROM DEMOCRATS FROM- INDEPENDENCE FROM NO PARTY PREFERENCE I MEAN WE REALLY TRIED TO STRETCH. AND NOT JUST GET ONE POINT OF VIEW I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT. THAT THE WORK THAT WE ARE DOING AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT'S GOING TO BE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA WHO WILL DECIDE OF THAT SO WHILE THERE HAS BEEN. SOME SUGGESTION THAT A SUPERMAJORITY OF ONE PARTY IS GOING TO JAM THROUGH ONE REFORM OR ANOTHER OR ONE CHANGE ANOTHER IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I THINK YOUR GOALS IN MIND OR TO PROVIDE A BROAD. CONSENSUS POINT OF CHANGE IF IT'S NEEDED- AND I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER. IS THAT IT'S REALLY FOR THE LONG TERM IT'S NOT FOR SOME INSTANT. CHANGE ONE THING OR ANOTHER THAT. PROTECTS OUR DEMOCRACY PROTECTS ACCOUNTABILITY. OF OUR ELECTED LEADERS- BUT- HAS- ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT TESTIFIED EARLIER. I KIND OF AVOIDED THE CLOWN CAR ELEMENTS THAT HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THIS PROCESS SO WITH THAT I THINK IT'S YOUR BERMAN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU- IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR GLAZER AND ADVISERS HERE TO- ONE IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING COMMENTS SURE THANK YOU. I FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR PARTICIPATING IN THIS- THIS IS A VERY GOOD CONVERSATION TO HAVE. BECAUSE THERE ARE QUESTIONS OUT THERE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME CHANGES- BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU KNOW THE INITIAL TEST.OF WHEN THIS PROCESS WAS A DILEMMA DEPT YEAH DEVELOPED IN NINETEEN ELEVEN. WE'RE SIMPLY A MISUSE OF POWER. IT WAS TO CHECK THE MISUSE OF POWER. AND YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD SOME THINGS IN HERE LIKE THE NOTION THAT OUR CITIZENS ARE INCAPABLE OF DETERMINING FOR THEMSELVES WHAT CONSTITUTES EITHER MALFEASANCE OR A MISUSE OF POWER- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE. ARE ARE. AYE I WOULD HESITATE TO TRY TO CATEGORIZE THEM LIKE THAT- I THINK OUR CITIZENS ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF DETERMINING WHAT CONSTITUTES MALFEASANCE OR AN ABUSE OF POWER. YOU KNOW IT'S SIGNATURE GATHERING IT APPEARS TO BE EFFECTIVE AS IT IS- WE'VE HEARD SOME TESTIMONY FROM SOME PEOPLE THAT CRUNCH NUMBERS AND ARE PRETTY MUCH EXPERTS. THAT IF WE MESS WITH THIS WE ARE MAKING THE PROCESS WE'RE TAKING IT FROM A PROCESS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW TO NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND THAT WILL NOT BE LOOKED ON KINDLY BY OUR CITIZENS AND VOTERS- NO AND LASTLY YOU KNOW I HEARD A COUPLE OF TIMES OUR OUR PROCESS IS AN OUT LIAR IN THE UNITED STATES. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD ALL YEAR IS THAT CALIFORNIA IS INDEED AN OUT LIAR IN DOING THE RIGHT THING TRYING TO LEAD THE NATION AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AND IN MAYBE OUR SYSTEM IS GOOD TO MAYBE OTHER PEOPLE NEED TO ASSIMILATE TO OUR SYSTEM INSTEAD- BUT ANYWAY- THE EXPERTS WERE VERY USEFUL AND I APPRECIATE THEIRTIME THAT THEY TOOK TODAY AND THE TIME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO PUT TOGETHER. WHAT WE DIG PUT TOGETHER A PANEL CAN GIVE US DIVERSE- OPINIONS ON THIS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU OF ICRC ARE JOE AND REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU KNOW YOU- VICE OR NIELSEN- FOR YOUR- PARTICIPATION IN IN TODAY'S HEARING- AND- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY YEAH I'M SURE YOUNG GROUP PARTICIPATION MOVING FORWARD- AS WE HAVE FUTURE HEARINGS. REALLY WANT TO THANK- MY COLLEAGUES AT YOUR GLAZER- AND HIS STAFF- FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IT FOR LIKE A WEEK THIS IS CENTER GLAZER AND I AT YOUR GLAZER AND I'VE GOT A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS. LEADING UP TO TODAY'S HEARING- AND I THINK WE ENDED UP IN A GREAT PLACE. WITH A VERY DIVERSE SET OF YOU POINTS AND PERSPECTIVES- I POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS- PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING IN OFFERING A BROAD SPECTRUM OF SUGGESTIONS. FOR HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK FOR EIGHT DO WE EVEN NEED TO REFORM OUR RECALL PROCESS OR NOT THERE WAS DISAGREEMENT ON THAT. BYE BYE TODAY'S WITNESSES AND THEN IF SO HOW- AND THERE'S PLENTY OF IDEAS. FOR US TO FLUSH OUT. OVER THE COMING MONTHS AS WE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO REFORM THE RECALL PROCESS I THINK WE ALL STRONGLY BELIEVE- THAT THAT CALIFORNIA MUST MAINTAIN A RECALL PROCESS. I THINK THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE DEVELOP A SYSTEM WHERE THE END RESULT IS IN THE EXACT SAME VOTE THAT HAPPENED THREE YEARS BEFORE. AND IT TWENTY FOUR PERCENT- YOU KNOW VICTORY I GUESS YOU WILL FOR THE INCUMBENT. BECAUSE I THINK THAT SHOWS THAT THE RECALL PROCESS IS. TOO EASY TO INITIATE AND DOESN'T PROPERLY REPRESENT CLOSE TO MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE- IF WE BELIEVE IN A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WE SHOULD HAVE A PROCESS THAT THAT. AT LEAST- CREATES SORT OF LIKE. THAT THE RECALL WILL BE COMPETITIVE- AND THAT IS WHAT WE SAW IN THIS INSTANCE AND SO WE SAW WAS. AN EXPENDITURE OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A DISTRACTION OF GOVERNANCE FOR ALMOST A YEAR- AND THAT'S THE ADDED TIME WHEN THEY WERE MAXIMUM CHALLENGES ALREADY THAT WERE FACING- AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I BELIEVE THAT'S GOOD FOR GOVERNANCE SO- I THINK THERE'S- A LOT MORE CONVERSATIONS TO BE HAD I KNOW WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER HEARING- HOPEFULLY PROBABLY THIS YEAR- WALL WALL MOUNTS THOSE DETAILS AS WE GET CLOSER- AS WE DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER. THE ISSUE OF LOCAL RECALLS I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ONE THAT WE PLAN. TO DIVE DEEPER INTO- AT THE NEXT HEARING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE GUBERNATORIAL RECALL BUT BUT IT'S LIKE WE HEARD FROM A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER- THEN AND A LOT OF LOCAL. ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO WERE EITHER BEING RECALLED OR UNDER THREAT OF RECALL AND EVEN BEING NDER THREAT OF RECALL. JUST HAVING SOMEBODY PULL PAPERS TO INITIATE A RECALL PROCESS. IS VERY DISTRACTING- AND VERY BAD I THINK FOR GOVERNANCE- ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF ACTUALLY QUALIFYING IT SO. THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK- BUT LOOK FOR TO CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM ACROSS THE AISLE. THANK YOU TO MY STAFF ALSO FOR ALL THE WORK THEY DID OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. A VERY GRATEFUL- TO IT TO EVERYBODY FOR REALLY PUTTING A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO THIS HEARING- ONE THING THE SERGEANTS FOR ALL THE WORK THEY DID- AS WELL- AND WITH THAT- THIS HEARINGS ADJOURNED.
