BECAUSE THE INTENTION IS TRYING

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:33.425
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DEAL

00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:35.093
WITH THESE ORPHANED WELLS THERE

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.161
WAS A STATEMENT MADE THAT

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:38.764
THERE'S ONLY SIXTEEN THERE'S

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.364
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WELLS AT

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.266

AND ANOTHER THIRTY THOUSAND

00:21:43.335 --> 00:21:45.237

TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO.

00:21:46.104 --> 00:21:48.373
OUR PROBLEM IS BIGGER -- IT THEN

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.175
IT'S BEEN A NUMBER OF SIXTEEN

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:51.410
AND WHEN.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.645
THE COMMUNITY DOESN'T HAVE A WAY

00:21:53.712 --> 00:21:54.913
TO PAY FOR IT THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.815
FOR THE CLEANUP AND AS IS BEING

00:21:56.882 --> 00:21:58.417
GIVEN AN EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW

00:21:58.483 --> 00:22:00.252
IT'S JUST A IN IN THE DISTRICT

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:01.853

AND SO.

00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:07.392
OUR HOPE IS TO CONTINUE THE

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:09.361
CONVERSATIONS TO IDENTIFY WHAT

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:11.697
ELEMENTS -- OF THIS COULD BE

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.231
ADOPTED IN A WAY.

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.734
THAT DOESN'T HAVE A MASTER GOAL

00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:17.769
OF SETTING ANYTHING DOWN BUT

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.137

WHERE THAT ACCOUNT WOULD BE USED

00:33:35.913 --> 00:33:38.015
TO BEGIN THE PROCESS TO GAIN

00:33:38.082 --> 00:33:40.184
PUBLIC ACCESS AND THAT BILL GOT

00:33:40.251 --> 00:33:41.285

RANCH OWNERS ARE ALSO AT THE

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.575
TABLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.411
HOW WE GET TO THE PLAN -- AND

00:34:06.477 --> 00:34:08.846
THE IDEA IS THAT THE GOAL.

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.681
IS THE KERRY IS WE ALL WORK

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.785
TOGETHER WE COME UP WITH A PLAN

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.820
TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ACCESS --

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:16.988
AND THAT PLAN INVOLVES THE

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:19.424
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:21.659

THE OLD PLAN IN AND SO WE ARE

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.739
HOPING WE WHAT THE BILL ALSO

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:36.140
DOES NOW IS THAT THE BILL

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:41.078
EXTENDS THAT DEADLINE FOR US TO

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:42.680
CREATE THIS PLAN.

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:44.382
UNDERSTOOD OKAY AND THE I

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.483
APPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS ON

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.818
MEANINGFUL WHEN IT COMES TO

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:48.586
ACCESS AND WE TALKED WE JUST

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:51.055

00:34:52.657 --> 00:34:54.459
SERVICES TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:56.093
WORK THOUGH IT DOESN'T WORK AND

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.964
AND SO IN ALL THOSE.

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:01.399
THIS IS WHERE WE GOT THAT --

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.568
ORNERY HOMEOWNER WHO WANTS TO BE

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:05.036
A NAME BE AND PUT UP THE NO

PARKING SIGN -- THAT'S

00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:10.007
UNACCEPTABLE AND AGAINST THE LAW.

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.742
THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU OPEN IT

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:12.910
UP.

00:35:12.977 --> 00:35:14.045

OF YOU CAN'T COME HERE --

00:35:30.061 --> 00:35:31.229
SERVICES.

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:34.198
AND OPERATIONAL -- OPPORTUNITIES

00:35:34.265 --> 00:35:37.101
TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK SO -- I

00:35:37.168 --> 00:35:38.836
I JUST WANTED PLEDGE OUR OUR

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:40.505
WILLINGNESS TO WORK -- THROUGH

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:41.539
THIS ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:42.940
DEADLINES I KNOW THIS IS SORT OF

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:44.475
JUST THE SHOT CLOCK BILL TO SAY

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:46.277
LIKE LET'S GET EVERYONE TGETHER.

00:35:46.344 --> 00:35:47.945
EVEN COME UP WITH SOMETHING HERE --

00:35:48.012 --> 00:35:49.380

JUST AS TO KEEP WORKING WITH

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.350
COMMITTEE AS WE SORT OF ROUND

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.252
THAT OUT -- BUT I THINK THERE'S

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:57.555
A GOOD PATH FOR HERE HOPEFULLY

00:35:57.622 --> 00:35:58.189
TO SETTLING THIS ISSUE IN A WAY

00:35:58.256 --> 00:36:00.992
THAT.

00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:02.326
THAT WORKS FOR ALL THE PARTIES --

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:03.895
WITH THAT I'D ENTERTAIN A MOTION

00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:04.896
OR QUESTIONS CENTER CAREER.

00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:08.733
I WILL MOVE THE BELL -- ALSO --

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:11.202
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT IT ONE

00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:12.503
OF THEM THE MORE DIFFICULT.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.804
ISSUES THAT I HAD IN THE

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:16.073
THIRTIETH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WAS

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.442
THAT -- HIGHWAY ONE IN -- BIG

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.444
SUR APART FROM THE LANDSLIDES

00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:21.779
AND ALL OF THAT.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.447
THE DEVASTATION IT HAPPENS --

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.582
KINDA NATURALLY.

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.951
BUT BUT THE ISSUE OF

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.953
ACCESSIBILITY OF THE BEACH IS

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.221
REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THERE'S

00:36:30.288 --> 00:36:33.491
ALSO A REAL NEED -- TO HAVE

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:35.860
RESTROOMS AND SO I'M GOING TO

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:37.562
PUT THAT ON THE RADAR SCREEN --

00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:39.497
THE FEDERAL FOREST SERVICE

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:41.799
REFUSED TO CHANGE THE SIGNAGE SO

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:42.500
THAT YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.901
RESTROOMS WERE ON FEDERAL

00:36:43.968 --> 00:36:45.536
PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY REALLY

00:36:45.603 --> 00:36:46.103
DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN OUT THE

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:47.004
TOILETS.

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.239
AND THE RESIDENTS WERE

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:49.607
COMPLAINING BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE

00:36:49.674 --> 00:36:52.043
THEN DOING THEIR BUSINESS ON THE

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:53.878
SIDE OF THE ROAD NEAR THERE.

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.112
SPOCK'S BOXES WHICH WAS KIND OF

00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:56.080
DISGUSTING.

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:58.783
SO -- SO SO ACT AXIS IS THE

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.585
FIRST POINT AND THEN IT THEN IT

00:37:00.651 --> 00:37:02.186
THEN THE WHOLE ISSUE OF HOW DO

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:03.020
YOU.

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:04.889
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.557
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:10.094
AND CAN FIND THE RESTROOMS AND --

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:11.963
AND WE'RE PARKING IS APPROPRIATE

00:37:12.029 --> 00:37:14.231
AS WELL BECAUSE IF YOU DRIVE

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.800
DOWN HIGHWAY ONE THE NUMBER OF

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:18.069
PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING PICTURES

00:37:18.135 --> 00:37:19.537
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:21.606
OUR OR ARE JUST DOUBLE OR TRIPLE

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:23.641
PARK IS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND SO

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.910
WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL COAST ON

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:26.978
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:29.280
RESTRICTIONS ON SIGNAGE.

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:31.015
AND WHAT YOU CAN POST OUT NEAR

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.451
THE ROADWAYS AND SO WE ME THIS

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:36.020
MAY BE A BIGGER ISSUE BUT I JUST

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:39.323
WANT TO IDENTIFY IT AS THERE ARE.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:40.291
THERE WERE FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVED

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:41.859
IN THE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:42.460
WHO DIDN'T WANT ANY TOURISTS

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.795
COMING THROUGH -- AND WE GOT TO

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:46.530
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO WHEN WE

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:48.299
HAVE INTERNATIONAL VISITORS THAT

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:49.066
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE

00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:51.035
AND ARE YOU ARE DOING THEIR BEST

USING EXISTING LAW.

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:16.140
THE THE PURE PROJECT SORT OF

00:46:16.206 --> 00:46:18.075
NECESSARILY HAS TO BE REGARDED

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:20.878
AS A CONTAMINATION OF DRINKING

00:46:20.944 --> 00:46:21.512
WATER RESOURCE EVEN THOUGH IT'S

00:46:21.578 --> 00:46:22.379
ACTUALLY.

00:46:22.446 --> 00:46:24.481
CLEANING THE WATER AND THE

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.816
SOURCE OF THE CONTAMINATION

00:46:25.883 --> 00:46:27.851
BEING THE RESERVOIR UNDER THE

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.353
CURRENT TERMINOLOGY WOULD BE

00:46:29.419 --> 00:46:31.855
REFERRED TO AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:46:31.922 --> 00:46:32.756
BUFFER.

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:33.924
SO A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:35.025
HEARING THAT TERM IS GONNA THINK

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:37.427
BUFFER MEANS SOME LETTER OF

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:38.762
PROTECTION.

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:39.930
THE FACT IN THE PIER ONE SYSTEM

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:40.564
THIS RESERVOIR THIS BEEN

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.266
AUGMENTED IS ACTUALLY SOURCE OF

00:46:42.332 --> 00:46:43.901
CONTAMINATION OF THE RECYCLED

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:44.968
WATER IT REALLY FLIP THAT ON ITS

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:46.970
HEAD THAT'S WHY THESE TERMS ONCE

WE CAN DEVELOP THIS TO DRINKING

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:50.607
WATER STANDARDS.

00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:51.208

ANALYSIS INTERNAL THE THE THE

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.877
SORT OF HOW THIS WILL IMPACT

00:47:26.944 --> 00:47:28.378
SCHOLARLY RESEARCH AND AND

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:29.313
WHETHER WE'RE GONNA GET SOME

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.881
CONFUSION BRED OUT OF THIS OR

00:47:30.948 --> 00:47:31.582
WHETHER WE THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.917
CHANGE I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:34.718

FRANKLY I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.996
THE BEST WAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.966
IS I'M RELYING ON THEIR RESEARCH

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:51.301
AND IS THAT AND BELIEVE ME I'VE

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:53.070
BEEN THE SCHOLAR.

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:56.240
THEY'LL FIGURE IT OUT SO TO THAT.

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:57.774
TO THAT PLAIN TALK FROM A

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.176

SORT OF HOW YOU ARRIVED AT THIS

00:48:04.881 --> 00:48:07.517
DECISION MAKING PROCESS.

00:48:07.584 --> 00:48:09.386
HOW ABOUT IF I TAKEN A SHOT AT

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:10.520

SO?

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.323
YOU KNOW THESE THAT INTERACT IN

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:16.126
DIRECT POTABLE REUSE TERMS -- I

00:48:16.193 --> 00:48:18.395
THINK I THINK THAT THE EVOLUTION

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:20.364
OF POTABLE REUSE AND AS I SAID

00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.064
AT THE BEGINNING WE ARE IN THE

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:23.100
NATION THEY ARE THE NATION AND

00:48:23.166 --> 00:48:27.804
THE WORLD LEADER FOR PEREA SO.

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.006
THIS NATION IS LOOKING TO US ON

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.140
WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE I GO

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:31.174
TO CONFERENCES WHERE THEY ARE

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.376
TALKING ABOUT HOW IS THE BEST

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:33.477
WAY TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THESE

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:34.511
PROJECTS.

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.079
AND THE TERMS INDIRECT AND

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:38.148
DIRECT HAVE REALLY CREATED.

00:48:38.215 --> 00:48:39.616
LIKE I SAID THIS THIS KIND OF

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:40.917
CONFUSION SO THERE HAS BEEN A

00:48:40.984 --> 00:48:42.786
NATIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:45.455
NEED TO CHANGE THESE TERMS.

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:47.991
AND TO FIND MORE.

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.093
UNDERSTANDABLE TERMINOLOGY --

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.829
YOU KNOW WITH WITH FIVE SEVENTY

00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:54.331
FOUR WE HAD TO LEAVE THOSE TERMS

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:55.932
IN THERE THERE WAS ANOTHER

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.334
PURPOSE FOR THAT BILL TO DEVELOP

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.669
THE RAW WATER AUGMENTATION

00:48:58.735 --> 00:48:59.970
REGULATIONS.

00:49:00.037 --> 00:49:01.238
THE TERMINOLOGY WAS A PART THAT

00:49:01.305 --> 00:49:02.673
WE SET FOR LATER THAT WAS

00:49:02.739 --> 00:49:03.874
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR OUR

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:06.276
ORGANIZATION AND FOR THE PR

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:07.344
PROFESSIONALS THAT I WORK ON

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.612
THIS AND I AND I GUESS I JUST

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.047
LIKE TO SAY THAT I MEAN OF ALL

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:11.748
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:12.349
PROJECTS THAT THEY'RE ON THE

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:13.383
STATE.

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:15.385
OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AND

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:16.887
CONSUMER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:19.022
PROJECT IS PROBABLY MORE

00:49:19.089 --> 00:49:20.991
IMPORTANT INPUT ARRAY OF CINEMAS

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:21.558
ANYTHING ELSE WERE DRINKING

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:21.892
WATER.

00:49:21.958 --> 00:49:23.694
RECYCLED WATER WERE EXPLAINING

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.065
THIS SO THAT WOULD BE MY URGING

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:28.865
ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TERMINOLOGY

00:49:28.932 --> 00:49:30.334
PARTICULARLY FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.502
RECYCLED WATER.

00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:33.270
AND WATER SOURCE AND SO AND IS

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.638
THE PUBLIC RESPONDING TO THE

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.907
TERM I MEAN EVERYONE LOVES LIKE.

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:39.042
RAW VEGETABLES AND RAW YOU KNOW

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:40.610
EVERY FANCY HEALTH FOOD STORE

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.312
YOU GO TO SO IT MEANS THAT PART

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:44.748
OF THE YEAH I MEAN LOGIC IS IT

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:46.116
IT DOESN'T.

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:48.218
SO WHEN ORINDA STILL WORKS

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:49.453
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT WHO'S THAT

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:50.921
WHO HAVE DID IT DONE TOWARDS

00:49:50.987 --> 00:49:52.756
FIVE THOUSAND PLUS PER -- THEY

00:49:52.823 --> 00:49:54.091
HAVE TOWARDS COME THE OF PEOPLE

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:55.792
COME TO TOWARD THEIR FACILITY.

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.294
THE INDIRECT AND DIRECT THEY

00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:59.129
THEY SURVEYED THEM AFTERWARDS

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:01.231
AND THAT THAT'S NOT HELPFUL IN

00:50:01.298 --> 00:50:02.666
TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:04.000
DIRECT.

00:50:04.067 --> 00:50:05.569
IMPLIES THAT THERE'S LESS

00:50:05.635 --> 00:50:07.504
TREATMENT I MEAN THAT'S JUST

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:13.377
NATURAL -- SO WE SO I BELIEVE

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.244
THAT THAT THEY ARE THEY USE THE

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:15.345
SURVEY INFORMATION AND THAT

00:50:15.412 --> 00:50:17.881
THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL -- TO

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.549
TO ASCERTAIN THAT'S ONE PLACE

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:20.951
WHERE WE GET THE INFORMATION BUT

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.619
AS I SAID P. R. PROFESSIONALS

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.854
ARE WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.988
ALL OVER THE STATE.

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:26.490
THEY HAVE LITTLE FOCUS GROUPS

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:28.125
AND THEY TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES

00:50:28.191 --> 00:50:29.426
SENSE TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:30.727
OBVIOUSLY TALKING ABOUT POTABLE

00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.596
RE ISN'T WHAT IS ACCURATE.

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.698
AND IN THE CONTEXT THE TERMS ON

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.400
AB FIVE SEVENTY FOUR MAKE THE

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:37.701
MOST SENSE UNDERSTOOD.

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.703
OKAY WELL -- THERE IS NO

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.271
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE A MOTION

00:50:41.338 --> 00:50:42.739
BUT I WOULD ENTERTAINMENT AT THE

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.341
APPROPRIATE TIME SO I'LL LET YOU

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.475
TO CLOSE DR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:49.346
LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:51.081
PEOPLE DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:51.848
THIS.

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:53.583
AND WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED FLY

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:56.086
AND TO **** MEANING.

00:50:56.153 --> 00:50:59.189
THE WATER GOES DIRECT FROM THE

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:02.392
READ TREATMENT PROGRAM TO CLEAN

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.828

00:51:04.895 --> 00:51:08.331

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:33.155
YEAR.

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:34.690
THAT WAS THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.759
FIRE IN CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.894
ALSO THE DEADLIEST WILDFIRE IN

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:40.096
CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.031
EARLIER THIS YEAR -- I HAD THE

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.566
OPPORTUNITY TO TOUR THE

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.434
DEVASTATED TOWN OF PARADISE AND

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:46.602
IT WAS INCREDIBLY POIGNANT

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.637
EXPERIENCE FOR ME. TO SEE THE

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:51.674
DEVASTATION THAT WAS WROUGHT IN

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.576
THAT COMMUNITY. TO ME THE MOST

01:06:53.642 --> 01:06:55.511
SURPRISING FACT OF THAT ENTIRE

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.513
VISIT WAS TESTIMONY THAT WE

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.881
RECEIVED FROM THE FIRST

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.049
RESPONDERS THAT WERE THERE IN

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.183
PARADISE.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.385
THE DAY OF THE FIRE.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.020
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:06.455
ALL OF THE EGRESS ROUTES OUT OF

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:08.124
PARADISE WERE COMPLETELY CLOGGED

01:07:08.190 --> 01:07:10.593
BECAUSE THE WILDFIRE HAD MOVED

01:07:10.659 --> 01:07:12.561
SO RAPIDLY IN FACT THEY TOLD US

01:07:12.628 --> 01:07:14.463
ABOUT PEOPLE SHELTERING IN PLACE

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:15.364
IN THEIR CARS.

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:16.966
IN INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE THAT

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.167
WAS THE WIDEST PLACE THOSE

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.969
PEOPLE COULD FIND TO GET AWAY

01:07:20.035 --> 01:07:21.537
FROM THE FLAMES UNFORTUNATELY

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:24.106
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE SURVIVED

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.808
BUT WE WILL NOT BE THAT LUCKY.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:27.076
AGAIN.

01:07:27.143 --> 01:07:28.844
PARADISE HAS FOR EGRESS ROUTES

01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:30.746
AND ALL FOUR OF THOSE WERE

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:31.347
COMPLETELY CLOGGED THE DAY OF

01:07:31.414 --> 01:07:32.214
THE FIRE.

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:34.450
I REPRESENT A LOT OF PLACES IN

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.819
OF MY DISTRICT THAT HAVE EVEN

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.554
WORSE EGRESS THE GROUCH THAN

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.289
THAT IN FACT WHERE I LIVE IN THE

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.290
CITY OF BIG BEAR LAKE WE ONLY

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:42.291
HAVE THREE EGRESS ROUTES.

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:45.094
SOME PLACES HAVE EVEN TWO OR ONE

01:07:45.161 --> 01:07:46.729
THE COMMUNITY OF IDYLLWILD WHICH

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:47.630
I'M SURE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:49.064

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.900
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

01:07:50.966 --> 01:07:51.767
DEVASTATION THAT WOULD BE

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:52.034
WROUGHT.

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:12.588
OF LEGISLATION THAT STRIKES AN

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.190
APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.601
LEADING AGENCY DETERMINATION OF

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.136
OF IT AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.105
BUT ALSO ALL LOCAL APPROVAL SO

01:11:16.171 --> 01:11:17.006
WHAT WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:20.309
THOSE LOCAL APPROVALS BEING AND

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:20.509
JUST.

01:11:20.576 --> 01:11:21.944
WATER SO WHAT THE PROCESS ADAM

01:11:22.011 --> 01:11:23.579
WE ARE INCLUDING -- PUBLIC

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:25.681
NOTIFICATION AND A HEARING ON

01:11:25.748 --> 01:11:27.249
THIS WHERE COMMENTS ARE RECEIVED

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:29.551
AND RESPONDED TO BY THE LOCAL

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:32.388
AGENCY -- SO THE PROCESS REALLY

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:33.055
STARTS AND BOARD OF FORESTRY

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.556
THEY IDENTIFY THE COMMUNITIES

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:35.658
THEY RECOMMEND MAKE

01:11:35.724 --> 01:11:36.992
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT SHOULD

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.694
BE DONE -- FROM THAT POINT

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.928
FORWARD IT WOULD BE UP TO THE

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.563
LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO CHOOSE TO

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:44.500
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT OR

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:47.670
NOT -- I'M SURE SOME LOCALS WILL

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.071
NEED SOME RESOURCES SOME MAY

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.239
HAVE THE RESOURCES IN PLACE SOME

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:52.074
MAY BE SEEKING MORE RESOURCES

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:55.878
FROM THE STATE -- SO FROM THAT

01:11:55.944 --> 01:11:56.912
DECISION POINT I'M SORRY TO

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:57.579
INTERRUPT YOU BUT NOT THAT LOCAL

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.148
DID WHEN THEY CHOOSE OR NOT IS

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.883
THAT THAT'S ABOUT OF SOME KIND

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.451
OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT DOES

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:10.225
IT IT SORT OF DEPENDS ON THE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:12.494
EXISTING USE OF THAT.

01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:13.062
THAT EGRESS THROUGH LIKE IF

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.463
THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING FIRE

01:12:14.530 --> 01:12:15.597
ROAD SAY RIGHT AND SO THERE

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:16.799
COULD BE AN EXISTING FIRE ROAD --

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.867
THAT IS EITHER CLOSED OFF ITS

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:20.969
UNPAVED ON IMPROVED -- IT'S

01:12:21.036 --> 01:12:23.672
CLOSED SO PEOPLE CAN'T USE IT --

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:24.640
SO THERE COULD BE A MINOR

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:26.341
PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:27.309
THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS IS THAT

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.744
A MINISTERIAL DECISION THERE OR

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.646
WOULD THAT BE A DISCRETIONARY

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:31.613
ONE FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT JUST

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.182
USE FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN IN THE

01:12:33.248 --> 01:12:34.083
SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS WITH FIRE

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:35.350
ROADS GOING ALL THROUGHOUT.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.385
AND THAT THAT WAS MY CENTRAL

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:38.554
CONCERN IN ANY QUEUE TO TRY TO

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.488
WORK THROUGH THIS.

01:12:39.555 --> 01:12:40.856
IT WAS LIVES ON THE LINE.

01:12:40.923 --> 01:12:42.925
WE GET THAT THIS IS SERIOUS

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.293
STUFF MEAN GO SOMEWHERE LIKE TO

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:45.894
PAY A CANYON AND YOU KNOW THAT

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:48.230
FIRE HITS WRONG DESPITE ALL THE

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.798
PREPARATIONS DONE.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:50.866
WE MAY LOSE LIFE.

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:51.500
THERE'S A V. ARE VERY REAL

01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:53.001
OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE'S ALSO ALL

01:12:53.068 --> 01:12:55.471
THESE WINDING FIRE ROADS ALL

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:57.673
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY -- BOTH

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.774
IN ANY CORPORATION DâN

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:01.043
INCORPORATED AREAS SO JUST

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.711
TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THAT

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:03.145
THIS IS.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:09.852
YEAH IT'S IT'S PROBABLY TRUE IN

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:10.486
OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WELL BUT

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:11.186
IS THERE A DISCRETIONARY

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:12.354
DECISION THAT THAT THAT THAT

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:12.855
COUNTY.

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:13.689
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE MAKING IN

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:15.023
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND AND WHAT

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:15.924
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE WITHOUT

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.993
SEEK HUESO THERE VERY WELL COULD

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.994
BE -- AND WOULD GO THROUGH THE

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.096
NORMAL PLANNING PROCESSES FROM

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:22.297
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO NORMAL

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.933
APPROVAL PROCESSES -- THE ONLY

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:25.734
THING THAT WE'RE DOING AS

01:13:25.801 --> 01:13:27.369
EXEMPTING THESE PROJECTS FROM

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.972
SEEK WAS SO -- THAT'S A BIT OF

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.306
INSULATION FROM POTENTIAL

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:32.975
LITIGATION AND IT'S ALSO SAVING

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.710
RESOURCES FOR THESE TYPES OF

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.612
PROJECTS -- AND DELAYS THAT MAY

01:13:36.678 --> 01:13:38.313
BE ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARING

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:41.083
DOCUMENTS AND LITIGATION -- SO

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.217
YOU'D STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:45.654
AND OBTAIN ANY OTHER PERMITS

01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:46.288
THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR THE S. R.

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:52.461
THE IT DEPENDS ON THE PROJECT SO.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.296
SO I'M SAYING TAKE A THE IF

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:55.430
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY IMPACT

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:57.399
TO A WATER CORES -- YOU MIGHT

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.233
HAVE TO LOOK AT STRING THAT

01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:59.201
ALTERATION PERMITS AND

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.269
MITIGATING ANY IMPACT.

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.904
WE'VE TRIED TO BUILD AND BUFFERS

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.205
AND TO THE BILL THAT BASICALLY

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:04.940
SAY THE PROJECT CAN'T CONTAIN A

01:14:05.007 --> 01:14:08.210
WETLANDS ARE RIPARIAN AREA -- SO

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.145
WITH RESPECT TO ESSAYS AND

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:11.980
PERMITS UNDER THE ESSAY -- FOR

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:13.649
THOSE SPECIES THE PROJECTS CAN'T

01:14:13.715 --> 01:14:15.484
IMPACTS THOSE SPECIES SO IT

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.386
DEPENDS ON STATE PERMITS OR

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.187
TALKING TO STREAM THAT

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.656
ALTERATION PERMITS AND SO THOSE

01:14:20.722 --> 01:14:22.724
WOULD BE STATE PERMITS ESA AT

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:24.359
YEAH AND I MENTIONED YESTERDAY I

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:25.327
MENTIONED.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.895
YOU SEE SO -- YEAH SURE -- SO

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.163
THERE COULD BE STATE PERMITS ANY

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.799
LOCAL PERMITS THAT MIGHT APPLY --

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.868
MAYBE SENATOR CAN SPEAK MORE TO

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.036
ENSURE MORE URBAN KIND OF COUNTY

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:36.271
JUST GIVE GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.773
WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE SO JOHN

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.341
THE CAN DOWN THE COUNTY SAN

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:40.309
DIEGO MORE URBAN BUT WE HAVE A

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:41.443
HUGE BACK COUNTRY ARE IN.

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:42.177
FACT WE ACTUALLY WORK WITH THIS

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:43.812
COMMITTEE A DECADE AGO ON A

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:44.613
HOLLINGSWORTH TO CHENEY BILL

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.147
WERE.

01:14:45.214 --> 01:14:52.588
LOOK AT SIMILAR CONCEPT OF

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.756
TRYING -- TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:55.924
DO BRUSH CLEARANCE AND OTHER

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:56.892
THINGS AROUND EGRESS IDENTIFIED

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.994
EGRESS AND FIRE SAFETY ROUTES

01:14:59.061 --> 01:15:01.063
FOR COMMUNITIES -- SO FROM THAT

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:02.764
AGAIN IT WAS A GOOD LOOKING AT

01:15:02.831 --> 01:15:03.665
SEA CA TRYING TO SPEED UP THE

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:04.633
PROCESSAT THAT POINT IS BECAUSE

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.300
WE HAD OUR OF FUNDS COMING FROM

01:15:05.367 --> 01:15:06.301
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR BRUSH

01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:09.872
CLEARANCE -- AND WE'D EXPORTED

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:11.740
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.108
WEEKS AGO OUT THIS HETHER YOU

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.676
DO A MASTERY AYE ARE.

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:15.677
AND THEN TEAR PROJECTS OFF OF

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:17.579
THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S WHY

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.447
WE'RE SUPPORTINGTHIS WE THINK

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:19.715
THIS IT'S BEEN SOMETHING AS THE

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:20.883
COUNTY SAN DIEGO WE STRUGGLED

01:15:20.949 --> 01:15:23.518
WITH AND WE THINK THIS MAKES AS

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:26.088
IS A GOOD BALANCE AND MAKES IT --

01:15:26.154 --> 01:15:27.189
SENSE BUT THERE ARE I'M NOT A

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:28.523
BELIEVER SO ALL THE LOCAL

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:29.625
PERMITS BUT I THINK -- MISTER

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:30.659
KENNEDY REALLY HAD ON IT THAT

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:32.494
THERE'S A WHOLE NUMBER OF THINGS

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:34.429
THAT WE HAVE TO DO.

01:15:34.496 --> 01:15:35.230
THIS FROM THE COUNTY SAN DIEGO'S

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:36.632
PERSPECTIVE WE ALSO WOULD

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.834
IDENTIFY THESE THERE ARE FIRE

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:39.968
IT'S ALREADY -- THERE BE THE

01:15:40.035 --> 01:15:42.204
PUBLIC NOTICING THE PUBLIC --

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:43.605
HEARINGS THAT I'D SAY THAT

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.373
IDENTIFICATION BY THAT'S

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.374
ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTS OF THE

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.777
COUNTY ITSELF HAS ALREADY.

01:15:48.844 --> 01:15:51.079
IDENTIFIED BY THE I DON'T KNOW I

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.648
I DON'T I HAVE TO FIND OUT AND

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:54.116
GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE BUT I

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:56.685
THINK OUR FIRE RESTORED HE DOES

01:15:56.752 --> 01:15:58.153
IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE CRITICAL

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.355
EGRESS ROUTES FOR COMMUNITIES.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:06.795
BUT I CAN BE I CAN VERIFY THAT

01:16:06.862 --> 01:16:08.597
AND GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE.

01:16:08.664 --> 01:16:09.965
DID YOU WANNA MAKE A COMMENT ON

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.667
THAT I I I'M TRYING TO BE

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:14.002
SENSITIVE TO THIS ISSUE AROUND --

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.738
USING EGRESS AS A PROXY FOR

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:18.607
DEVELOPMENT -- AND AND TRYING TO

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:19.141
SORT OF PREVENT.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.175
THAT BACK DURING ESSENTIALLY OF

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.411
NEW DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:22.978
GOING IN.

01:16:23.045 --> 01:16:23.612
WHEN WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO WITH

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:24.579
HIS CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:26.481
AND IT'S HARD TO SAY OKAY NOW

01:16:26.548 --> 01:16:27.382
YOUR BILL TO ROAD?

01:16:27.449 --> 01:16:29.051
YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR ANYTHING

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.652
ELSE BUT LEAVING DURING A FIRE

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:33.455
THAT'S JUST PROBABLY NOT HOW

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:34.056
IT'S GOING TO BE I THINK THAT

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.490
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT

01:16:35.557 --> 01:16:39.094
YOU BROUGHT UP AND I THINK. TO

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:40.062
BE CLEAR.

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:41.563
THESE PROJECTS DO NOT PERCOLATE

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:42.431
UP FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S THE

01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:42.998
OPPOSITE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:44.733
FORESTRY IDENTIFIES.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.268
THE AYE COMMUNITIES IN PROJECTS

01:16:46.335 --> 01:16:48.704
THAT HAVE INSUFFICIENT EGRESS

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.505
AND THOSE ARE THE ONLY PROJECTS

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.007
THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

01:16:52.074 --> 01:16:53.575
LIMITED SEQUEL EXEMPTION THAT

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:56.078
THIS BILL -- THAT THIS BILL

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:57.379
OFFERS AND THEN IT WOULD REQUIRE.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:58.947
PARTICIPATION AND BY AND FROM

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.515
THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO SAY FROM

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.217
THEIR POINT OF VIEW YES WE'RE

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:03.452
GOING TO UNDERTAKE THIS PROJECT

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:05.053
SO IT'S DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.688
COLLABORATION AND BOTH PARTIES

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:07.723
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE AND

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.124
AS WAS TESTIFIED -- THERE'S

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.525
PUBLIC INPUT IN THIS PROCESS TO

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.394
THE BILL REQUIRES PUBLIC

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:15.630
HEARINGS BEFORE THAT WOMEN

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:17.699
EXEMPTION IS GRANTED.

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.001

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.313
PERSPECTIVE HERE.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.548
THERE'S TOO MANY RISKS IN THIS

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:36.284
PARTICULAR REGION TO HAVE THAT

VERY LIMITED AND SPECIAL SET OF

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:16.558
CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR THAT'S WHY

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:17.893
DON'T HAVE OPPOSITION FROM RIGHT

01:18:17.959 --> 01:18:18.393
ARMENIANS IN THE REMOTE

CONSTRAINTS ARE SO THAT WE CAN.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.798
SORT OF MAINTAIN THAT DICRETION

01:18:56.865 --> 01:18:59.234
AND I'M THINKING A MULTI ROADS

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:03.004
RECOMMENDATIONS COMING IN.

01:19:03.071 --> 01:19:03.738

COMING UP WITH MEMBERS TO JUST

01:19:08.210 --> 01:19:09.878
HOW TO GET THAT REASSURANCE

01:19:09.945 --> 01:19:12.047
BUILT INTO THIS FRAMEWORK -- YOU

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:13.882

TO THAT -- THE B. B. TWELVE

01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:21.957
SEEMS LIKE THE MOST -- RIGOROUS

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:23.058
PORTION IN TERMS OF WHERE THE

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:24.493
LEAD AGENCY DETERMINES THE

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:25.994
PROJECT IS A PAIN THERE IS ABLE

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.095
TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY FUNDING

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:28.864
AND ANY STATE FEDERAL OR LOCAL

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:32.234
APPROVAL AND LOCAL APPROVALS

IT IS YOURS IS THERE ANYTHING IN

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:37.973
THERE THAT WE CAN SORT OF DUE.

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.040
TO MAKE CLEAR THEY'RE STILL

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:40.809
DISCRETION FOR LOCAL STATUS SAY

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:41.776
NO PROBLEM IN LOOK IS SOMEONE

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:42.444
WHO CAME UP FROM LOCAL

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:44.112
GOVERNMENT AS A LOT OF US DID I

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.480
CERTAINLY BELIEVE THE AND THAT

01:19:45.547 --> 01:19:46.715
FORMER LOCAL CONTROL.

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:49.251
AND WE TOOK WE CRAFTED THE BILL

01:19:49.317 --> 01:19:51.019
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE LOCAL

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:52.854
BY AND AND HONESTLY I CAN'T

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:53.755
IMAGINE.

01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:55.290
HOW A PROJECT LIKE THIS WOULD

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.292
EVER BE DONE AND ACCOMPLISHED

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:58.026
WITHOUT?

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:00.395
THE ACTIVE ADVOCACY NOT JUST THE

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:01.296
DAHLE TACIT APPROVAL BUT THE

01:20:01.363 --> 01:20:03.098
ACTIVE ADVOCACY OF THE LOCAL

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:04.166
AGENCIES INVOLVED SO I'M

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:05.901
CERTAINLY OPEN TO ANYTHING THAT

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:06.801
THAT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:08.803
CONCERNS I THINK THAT THE BILL

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:09.604
AS WRITTEN.

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:11.806
ALREADY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:13.441
LEAD AGENCY IS A LOCAL AGENCIES

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:15.277
THIS ISN'T THE STATE COMING AND

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:19.881
SAYING YOU MUST DO THIS -- BUT A

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:22.250
I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:23.618
I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.020
CRITICAL POINT FROM A FROM A

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.555
SEQUEL PERSPECTIVE LEAD AGENCY

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:28.290
IS STILL LOCAL -- SELECTION

01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:29.991
PROCESS IN ELIGIBILITY PROCESS

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:30.892
COMES ON BOARD OF FORESTRY.

01:20:30.959 --> 01:20:31.793
BUT THAT DISCRETION STILL

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.528
ESSENTIALLY LIES WITH THE LEAD

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:36.731
AGENCY TO SAY.

01:20:36.798 --> 01:20:38.900

THE REFERENCE TO SOME OF THE

01:20:52.314 --> 01:20:53.815
CHALLENGES IN PARADISE.

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:55.317
I'D ALSO HEARD THAT THERE HAD

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:57.819
BEEN SOME PLANNING. TO HAVE A

01:20:57.886 --> 01:21:00.288
BUFFER ZONES ALONG AT LEAST ONE

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.824
ESCAPE GROUP WHERE THEY TURNED.

01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.326
TWO LANES INTO BOTH EXIT LANE

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.394
SENATE THAT ADVANCE PLANNING

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:08.830
ACTUALLY DID RESULT IN SAVING

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.600
LIVES IN PARADISE AND WELL.

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:12.801
IT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ENOUGH TO

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:14.069
SAVE.

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:16.438
THE LIVES THAT PERISHED FROM.

01:21:16.504 --> 01:21:18.873
IT DOES PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE OF

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.775
THE IMPORTANCE -- IT COULD HAVE

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:21.476
BEEN A MUCH HIGHER.

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:24.212
DEATH TOLL.

TO LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S ANY

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:25.240
BELT AND SUSPENDERS WE NEED TO

WHAT THIS BILL IS AND WHAT IT

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.593
ISN'T?

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.595
RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THE INPUT

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:48.963
FROM REALTORS AN APARTMENT

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:50.732
ASSOCIATION BUILDING INDUSTRY

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:52.467
BUT THAT SENDS A CERTAIN SIGNAL

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.868
IT SAYS LIKE.

01:22:53.935 --> 01:22:55.303

ZERO IF THE CONCERN IS THAT.

01:23:15.256 --> 01:23:16.191
THE BOARD WOULD FORCE ONE OF

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.392
THESE IGRICE PROJECTS ON A

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:18.827
COMMUNITY AND A LEAD AGENCY THAT

01:23:18.893 --> 01:23:19.661
DID NOT WANT IT.

01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:22.964
THAT.

01:23:23.031 --> 01:23:24.799
THAT THIS IS ONLY INTENDED TO BE

01:23:24.866 --> 01:23:26.167
DONE WHEN THERE'S A COOPERATION

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:27.769

VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL ASSOCIATION.

01:32:13.928 --> 01:32:15.696
THREE PRINCIPAL CONCERNS

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.632
ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE BILL --

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:18.900
FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE'S

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:21.235
PENDING LITIGATION ON THIS ISSUE

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.304
AND TYPICALLY POLICY COMMITTEES

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:24.972
IN THIS HOUSE AND AND OTHER

01:32:25.039 --> 01:32:25.473
HOUSES.

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:27.208
TEND NOT TO TAKE UP LEGISLATION

01:32:27.275 --> 01:32:28.910
WHEN PENDING LITIGATION IS UNDER

01:32:28.976 --> 01:32:32.246
WAY -- IF CALIFORNIAN THE OTHER

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:33.447
SIX STATES SUCCEED I THAT

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:34.482
LITIGATION.

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:36.684
IN THIS ISSUE OF DIFFERENCE

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.286
BETWEEN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

01:32:38.352 --> 01:32:39.787
CALIFORNIA GOES AWAY.

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.722
SO WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

01:32:41.789 --> 01:32:43.090
COMMITTEE TO HOLD THE BILL --

01:32:43.157 --> 01:32:45.192
UNTIL THAT LITIGATION RUNS ITS

01:32:45.259 --> 01:32:49.864
COURSE -- THE SECOND IS THAT.

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:50.498
EVEN UNDER THE CURRENT SITUATION

01:32:50.564 --> 01:32:52.366

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.868
VIOLATION UNDER STATE LAW.

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.836
SO IT'S UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT THE

01:32:55.903 --> 01:32:59.640
NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS.

01:32:59.707 --> 01:33:00.775
ONLY THE FOR THE FINAL IN THE IN

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.443

INCONSISTENCY WITH STATE LAW

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:32.540

01:35:50.811 --> 01:35:52.346
WOULD ACTUALLY.

01:35:52.413 --> 01:35:53.681
CREATE EXPECTATIONS THAT

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:54.748
INDUSTRY CAN RELY ON AND THAT'S

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:55.883
WHY YOU HAVE SO MANY INDUSTRIES

01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.152
PULL OFF OPPOSITION AND ALL IT

01:35:58.219 --> 01:35:59.120

EXPECTATIONS OF BEST MANAGEMENT

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:07.428
PRACTICES -- AND SO IT BECOMES

01:36:07.495 --> 01:36:08.329
INSULTING.

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:10.264
THIS THIS TREATY AND THIS

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.031
PARTICULAR THIS PARTICULAR BILL

NOT BE KILLED YET THESE

01:36:17.938 --> 01:36:19.540
BASSMASTER PRACTICES AND SO --

01:36:19.607 --> 01:36:21.342
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING -- THAT

01:36:21.408 --> 01:36:24.044
WILL PREVENT -- THE FLOOD

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:26.847
CONTROL ASSOCIATION AND ITS

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:27.915

01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:30.518
DECADES.

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:31.785
THERE'S NO REAL TO THERE'S NO

01:36:31.852 --> 01:36:37.124
RISK OF INCREASED LIABILITY AT

ALL VERY GOOD.

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.828

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:44.598
EVIDENT -- IN TERMS OF THE

01:36:44.665 --> 01:36:46.367
FISHING GAME -- CODE AND AND

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:47.034
SORT OF ENFORCEMENT THERE DIDN'T

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:48.269
SOUND LIKE THERE'S ANY VERSION.

01:36:48.335 --> 01:36:50.337
TO THAT CLARIFICATION SO THAT

01:36:50.404 --> 01:36:52.072
THAT SEEMS LIKE A A SOLVABLE

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:54.041
ISSUE AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO

01:36:54.108 --> 01:36:57.444
THE ISSUE RAN PENDING LITIGATION.

01:36:57.511 --> 01:36:58.279
I MEAN THAT THE LITIGATION IS

01:36:58.345 --> 01:37:00.214
ABOUT -- AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION

01:37:00.281 --> 01:37:01.348
ESSENTIALLY FROM THE TRUMP

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.484
ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE

01:37:03.551 --> 01:37:04.985
INTERPRETATION OF MIGRATORY.

DISCRETION NAY ONE EXERCISE I

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.194
THINK IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.496
THE STATE TO DO ITS OWN PART

01:37:15.563 --> 01:37:17.398
HERE AND LOOK AFTER OURSELVES --

RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED USING

01:51:14.367 --> 01:51:17.270
VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF ALLIGATORS.

01:51:17.337 --> 01:51:18.838
IT TURNS OUT THAT ALLIGATORS

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.540
HAVING EVOLVED AND SURVIVED OVER

01:51:20.607 --> 01:51:22.375
MILLIONS OF YEARS HAVE A VARIETY

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.977

ALLIGATORS HAVE A NATURAL

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:38.224
DEFENSE AGAINST MANY INFECTIOUS

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.959
DISEASES THAT PLAGUE HUMAN SUCH

AS HIV AND GONORRHEA.

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.363
RESEARCHERS AT UC IRVINE ARE

01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:45.298
CURRENTLY CONDUCTING RESEARCH IN

01:51:45.365 --> 01:51:47.500
THE ANTI.

01:51:47.567 --> 01:51:49.069
PROPERTIES OF ALLIGATOR BLOOD.

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:50.703
IN ADDITION THE CANCER RESEARCH

01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:52.105
HAS GONE PER IT'S REALLY

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:53.506
PERSONAL TO ME.

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.974
I HAVE RECENTLY LOST A CLOSE

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.543
FRIEND AND MENTOR TO CANCER AND

01:51:56.609 --> 01:51:58.812
IF THERE IS A POTENTIAL TO MAKE

01:51:58.878 --> 01:52:00.380
PROGRESS ON CANCER RESEARCH WE

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.148
MUST ENSURE THAT THIS IS ALLOWED

01:52:02.215 --> 01:52:04.417
TO CONTINUE. FOR WHATEVER REASON

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:05.518
IT APPEARS THAT SELLS AN

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.987
ALLIGATOR BLOOD ARE COMPLETELY

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:09.322
RESISTANCE TO CANCER.

ALLIGATORS.

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:20.733
I BOTH CSU SAN MARCOS AND CSU --

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:22.202
SAMPLER DINO RESEARCH IS BEING

01:52:22.268 --> 01:52:23.670
CONDUCTED.

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:24.971

CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY

01:52:26.806 --> 01:52:28.408
QUALITIES FOUND IN ALLIGATORS

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:29.542
WHICH MAY HELP IMPROVE THE

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:33.713
QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:34.848
SUFFERING FROM STROKES.

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.082
USC IS ALSO CURRENTLY CONDUCTING

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:37.183
DENTISTRY RESEARCH INTO

01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:38.351
ALLIGATOR CAPACITY TO DO

01:52:38.418 --> 01:52:39.385
REGENERATE TEETH WITH THE GOAL

01:52:39.452 --> 01:52:40.520
OF CREATING THAT QUALITY IN

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:41.855
HUMANS.

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.323
THESE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:44.724
THIS TYPE OF GROUND BREAKING

01:52:44.791 --> 01:52:46.659
MEDICAL RESEARCH BEING CONDUCTED

01:52:46.726 --> 01:52:47.961
USING ALLIGATOR BLOOD.

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:50.463
TEETH BODY PARTS AS WELL AS

01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:51.698
WHOLE ALLIGATORS.

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:54.000
SO HOW DOES THIS BILL HELP WITH

01:52:54.067 --> 01:52:55.835
THE RESEARCH.

01:52:55.902 --> 01:52:58.338
IN TWO WAYS FIRST.

01:52:58.404 --> 01:52:59.506
IF THE CURRENT LAW BANGLES INTO

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:00.974
EFFECT.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.109
ON JANUARY FIRST ALLIGATOR BLOOD

ALLIGATOR EGGS OR YEAR EARNINGS.

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:24.998
BUT COST OF THESE RESEARCH.

01:53:25.064 --> 01:53:26.199
THE OPPOSITION CLAIMS THAT THIS

01:53:26.266 --> 01:53:27.700
BILL IS ABOUT EXPENSE HE

01:53:27.767 --> 01:53:30.403
EXPENSIVE LUXURY GOODS MADE FROM

PRODUCTS THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE

01:53:32.906 --> 01:53:35.141
NON ESSENTIAL LUXURY GOODS.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.043
I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THOSE

01:53:37.110 --> 01:53:39.145
PRODUCTS BUT I DO CARE ABOUT THE

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.813
AMAZING MEDICAL RESEARCH THAT IS

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.215
BEING CONDUCTED AND THE NEED TO

01:53:42.282 --> 01:53:43.883
PASS THIS BILL SO WE DO NOT

01:53:43.950 --> 01:53:45.451
ELIMINATE OR INCREASE THE COST

01:53:45.518 --> 01:53:47.086
OF THAT RESEARCH. TWO OTHER

PROPERLY RESTORED MAINTAIN

01:55:43.002 --> 01:55:44.470
WETLANDS CAN ACTUALLY SEQUESTER

01:55:44.537 --> 01:55:46.139
UP TO FOUR TIMES THE CARBON PER

01:55:46.205 --> 01:55:47.640
ACRE THAN FOREST SO THIS IS A

ANALYSIS WHICH IS ON THE BOTTOM

02:25:09.267 --> 02:25:10.401

AYE AYE MY UNDERSTANDING OF

02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:23.081
HISTORY THIS IS THAT THIS COMES

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:26.217
UP EVERY TIME THERE'S AN ATTEMPT --

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:27.585
TO TO TRY TO EXTEND THE SUNSET

02:25:27.652 --> 02:25:29.120
INDUSTRY SAYS ALL WE'RE WORKING

02:25:29.187 --> 02:25:31.289
ON WE'RE WORKING ON A AND THEN --

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:32.657
NO SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IS MADE

02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:34.892
AND AND THEY KEEP TALKING ABOUT

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:35.860
ALL THE GOOD THINGS HAPPENING

02:25:35.927 --> 02:25:36.928
LOUISIANA AND THAT ALL MAY BE

02:25:36.994 --> 02:25:38.863
THE CASE YOU KNOW I I DON'T I

02:25:38.930 --> 02:25:40.364
CAN'T SPEAK TO PERSONALLY -- BUT

02:25:40.431 --> 02:25:42.133
I I I AND AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE

02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:43.067
ISSUE AND I THINK THERE'S A

02:25:43.134 --> 02:25:44.735
BUNCH OF ETHICS ISSUES THAT HAVE

02:25:44.802 --> 02:25:45.736
BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION.

02:25:45.803 --> 02:25:46.971
I WOULD RATHER SPEND SOME TIME

02:25:47.038 --> 02:25:49.841
LOOKING AT AS WELL IN TERMS OF

02:25:49.907 --> 02:25:50.441
YOU KNOW THE WAY THESE ANIMALS

LIVING ANIMALS IS THAT CORRECT.

02:27:02.713 --> 02:27:04.415

I'VE HAD THE BILL INTERPRETED TO

02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:31.542
ME BUT I GUESS THE QUESTION IS

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:34.312
THERE SUCH A DISTINCTION IN MY

02:27:34.378 --> 02:27:36.080
VIEW.

02:27:36.147 --> 02:27:37.081

SO PART WE DID HAVE THAT

02:27:51.662 --> 02:27:53.864
DISCUSSION AND THE WAY THE WORK

02:27:53.931 --> 02:27:55.900
I'M CALLING IT -- THE ECONOMIC

02:27:55.967 --> 02:27:59.237
ECOSYSTEM IS THAT THE FUNDING

02:27:59.303 --> 02:28:01.772
FOR THE MARSHES AND IF WHERE'S

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:03.674
THAT MIGHT THAT GUY -- CAN

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:14.218
GUY -- BY THE SALE OF THOSE.

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:14.852
FEDEX.

02:28:17.288 --> 02:28:19.223
IT'S NOT ONE OR THE OTHER IF YOU.

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:20.858
ELIMINATE ONE THAN THE OTHER

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.493
FUNDING DOESN'T HAPPEN AND SO

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:24.528
IT'S KINDA IT'S ALL THE

02:28:24.595 --> 02:28:26.330
ECOSYSTEM IS CONNECTED.

THAT THROUGH THE CHAIR.

02:28:33.671 --> 02:28:35.139
YEAH -- THE IN YET MAYBE WE

02:28:35.206 --> 02:28:36.107
COULD GET SOME CLEARING JUST

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:37.475
LOOKING AT THE CODE HERE JUST.

02:28:37.541 --> 02:28:40.711
IT'S CURRENT LAWS.

02:28:40.778 --> 02:28:42.813
DEAD BODY OR ANY PART OR PRODUCT

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:45.316
THEREOF SO WHETHER THE THE PART

02:28:45.383 --> 02:28:45.616
[inaudible]

02:28:45.683 --> 02:28:48.219
THEREOF IS SENATOR AND HAS TO BE

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:50.454
RELATED BACK TO THE DEAD BODY

02:28:50.521 --> 02:28:52.089
VERSES LIVE BIG RIGHT COULD YOU

02:28:52.156 --> 02:28:53.824
COMMENT ON A MISTER CHAIRMAN

02:28:53.891 --> 02:28:55.026
THERE'S TWO POINTS HERE YOU'RE

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:56.460
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT ABOUT

02:28:56.527 --> 02:28:58.062
THE READ OF THE CURRENT STATUTE.

02:28:58.129 --> 02:28:59.664
THE RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED NOT

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:02.400
JUST WITH EGGS WHICH MAY BE

02:29:02.466 --> 02:29:06.137
CONSIDERED OF A LIVING THING.

02:29:06.203 --> 02:29:07.872
ALSO ALLIGATORS LIVE ALLIGATORS

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:10.007
BUT IT'S ALSO CONDUCTED WITH

02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:11.242
SERUM BLOOD.

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:14.011
T. ANOTHER ALLIGATOR PARTS THAT

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:15.313
COME FROM.

02:29:15.379 --> 02:29:16.747
THAT ALLOCATED BODY SO.

02:29:16.814 --> 02:29:18.215
THE RESEARCH BEING DONE USING

02:29:18.282 --> 02:29:21.519
THOSE PRODUCTS WOULD NOT BE ABLE

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.920
TO CONTINUE BECAUSE OF THE BAND.

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:25.556
SECONDLY RELATIVE TO THE LIVE

02:29:25.623 --> 02:29:26.424
ALLIGATORS CENTER MONNING WHICH

02:29:26.490 --> 02:29:30.761
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS.

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:33.097
THE WAY THE ECO SYSTEM WORKS IS

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:34.265
THAT THE WETLANDS WHICH IS THE

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:36.434
SOURCE OF THE YEARLING

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.703
ALLIGATORS THAT ARE IMPORTED FOR

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.271
CAL STATE SAMBAR DINO WAR THE

02:29:40.338 --> 02:29:43.507
EGGS THAT ARE IMPORTED AT USC.

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.209
IS SUPPORTED BY THE FINANCIAL

02:29:45.276 --> 02:29:46.877
REVENUE THAT.

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:48.979
EMANATES FROM THE COMMERCIAL

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.648
MARKET IF THAT AN INITIAL

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:52.149
REVENUE ISN'T THERE TO SUPPORT

02:29:52.216 --> 02:29:54.952
THE WETLANDS THE NESTING AREAS.

02:29:55.019 --> 02:29:57.154
THEN. ONE OF TWO THINGS HPPENS

02:29:57.221 --> 02:29:59.423
EITHER IN THOSE RESEARCH PARTS

02:29:59.490 --> 02:30:00.758
BECOME.

02:30:00.825 --> 02:30:03.060
MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:30:03.127 --> 02:30:04.295
AND AND I CAN TESTIFY ON A

02:30:04.362 --> 02:30:05.629
PERSONAL LEVEL DOING OTHER

02:30:05.696 --> 02:30:06.864
MEDICAL RESEARCH WHEN YOU HAVE

02:30:06.931 --> 02:30:09.233
TO PAY THE TWENTY THOUSAND

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.569
DOLLARS FOR A MOUSE. TO DO.

02:30:11.635 --> 02:30:12.670
RESEARCH SECOND TELL YOU A

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:14.405
BECOMES VERY EXPENSIVE VERY

02:30:14.472 --> 02:30:15.272
QUICKLY.

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:17.975
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.343
COMMERCIAL MARKET TO SUPPORT.

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:21.345
THE EGGS AND THE LIVE ALLIGATORS

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:23.314
THE FARMS THAT PROVIDE THE LIVE

02:30:23.381 --> 02:30:25.750
ALLIGATORS FOR THE WILD.

02:30:25.816 --> 02:30:27.151
THE COST OF THOSE BECOME.

02:30:27.218 --> 02:30:29.553
A MUCH HIGHER IF YOU'RE USING

02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:31.255
LIFE PRODUCTS BUT IF YOU'RE

02:30:31.322 --> 02:30:32.490
USING IN FACT.

02:30:32.556 --> 02:30:33.924
PARTS OF DEAD ALLIGATORS FOR THE

02:30:33.991 --> 02:30:37.161
RESEARCH THAN THAN THE BAN WOULD

02:30:37.228 --> 02:30:38.562
NOT ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR IN WHAT

02:30:38.629 --> 02:30:41.866
PERCENT OF THE COMMERCIAL MARKET

02:30:41.932 --> 02:30:42.166
[inaudible]

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:43.701
IS CALIFORNIA.

02:30:43.768 --> 02:30:45.403
SO MY UNDERSTANDING AND

02:30:45.469 --> 02:30:46.804
ESTIMATES DONE BY OTHER STATES

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:48.706
IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF

02:30:48.773 --> 02:30:50.040
THE NATIONAL MARKET IS

02:30:50.107 --> 02:30:51.041
APPROXIMATELY 25% [inaudible]

02:30:51.108 --> 02:30:52.977
THANK YOU.

02:30:53.043 --> 02:30:54.745

THANK SAID ARRIVAL WILL AYE AYE

02:30:58.849 --> 02:30:59.450
AYE AND SHE ADDS I THINK WAS IN

02:30:59.517 --> 02:31:00.317
SOME EMIGRES OPENING

02:31:00.384 --> 02:31:03.020
PRESENTATION ABOUT THE EXPECTED.

02:31:03.087 --> 02:31:04.922
ECONOMIC DECLINES IN THE MARKET

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:06.157
I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

02:31:06.223 --> 02:31:07.958
ENGAGING SO LET'S TOUCH ON THAT

02:31:08.025 --> 02:31:08.459
I'LL KICKING THE CENTER

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:09.493
HERTZBERG THEN WE CAN TRY TO

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.895
SORT OF CENTRALIZED SOME OF

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.897
THESE ISSUES HERE SO.

02:31:12.963 --> 02:31:14.265
UNLESS.

02:31:14.331 --> 02:31:16.734

ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WERE

02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:19.937
CENTER ALLEN.

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:20.571
I THINK THAT THERE IS THIS ISSUE

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:26.377
ABOUT TRACKING THAT IF IN FACT.

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:27.311
IGGY WAS BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME

02:31:27.378 --> 02:31:28.112
THIS IS LIKE SALMON OR THERE'S

02:31:28.179 --> 02:31:28.846
ALL SORTS OF THINGS WHERE.

02:31:28.913 --> 02:31:30.948
WE HAVE LIVING -- ANIMALS THAT

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:33.451
ARE.

02:31:33.517 --> 02:31:34.452
BUT IT'S COWS OR WHATEVER ELSE

02:31:34.518 --> 02:31:36.120
IT IS BUT THAT THE INCENTIVE

02:31:36.187 --> 02:31:38.622
VISION FOR IT IS IN A WAY FOR

02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:41.225
FOR THIS NOT TO HAPPEN THAT

02:31:41.292 --> 02:31:43.227
CONCEPTS TO CREATE SOME.

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:44.361
I CAN -- CONSTRAIN TIMELINE TO

02:31:44.428 --> 02:31:46.430
DEAL WITH THIS TRACKING AND MAKE

02:31:46.497 --> 02:31:47.798
IT REALLY REAL TO ME.

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.200
IS SOMETHING THAT IN ESSENCE

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:50.668
BASICALLY SAYS THIS IS WHAT YOU

02:31:50.734 --> 02:31:52.236
REPRESENTED IN THE ART THE

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:53.370
ARGUMENT IT WOULD BE.

02:31:53.437 --> 02:31:54.138
DO WHAT YOU SAY YOU'RE GOING TO

02:31:54.205 --> 02:31:55.039
DO IT RIGHT LET'S JUST MAKE SURE

WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT

02:31:56.740 --> 02:31:58.509
ALLOWS THAT HAPPENED THE TIME TO

02:31:58.576 --> 02:31:59.677
DO THAT SO I THINK IT'S AN

02:31:59.743 --> 02:32:01.378
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT FLAW

02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:02.379
CIRCLE BACK WITH WITH SENATOR

02:32:02.446 --> 02:32:04.482

NO NO NATIONAL MARKET MIGHT BE

02:33:08.812 --> 02:33:11.749
LESS BUT LET'S SAY 25% DROP OFF

02:33:11.815 --> 02:33:12.850
COMES FROM.

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:15.853
THE THE BAND GOING INTO EFFECT --

02:33:15.920 --> 02:33:18.122
SEE ABOUT A SEVEN FIFTY MILLION

02:33:18.188 --> 02:33:20.824
DOLLAR TRADE MEAN [inaudible]

02:33:20.891 --> 02:33:22.326
I. D..

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:23.994
I'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE

02:33:24.061 --> 02:33:25.496
LOOKING AT IT AT THIS SORT OF

02:33:25.563 --> 02:33:27.531
RESEARCH DRIVEN APPROACH WHERE

02:33:27.598 --> 02:33:29.366
YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

02:33:29.433 --> 02:33:33.137
ADDRESS A THE ABILITY FOR

02:33:33.203 --> 02:33:34.872
INSTITUTIONS KEEP DOING THIS

02:33:34.939 --> 02:33:35.139
RESEARCH.

02:33:35.205 --> 02:33:36.574
AND THEN.

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:39.209
LOOK LOOK AT STUDY REPORT ON

02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:40.911
ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND SEE HOW

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:44.281
THAT MIGHT DIRECTLY IMPACT --

02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:47.117
THE THE INDUSTRY SO IF PRICES IN

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:48.218
FOR INSTANCE MISTER LANG POINT I

02:33:48.285 --> 02:33:49.553
BECAME EGREGIOUS AND YOU'RE

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:51.288
SEEING SOME MAJOR ECONOMIC

02:33:51.355 --> 02:33:53.390
IMPEDIMENT TO BEING ABLE TO GO

02:33:53.457 --> 02:33:54.658
TO THAT CANCER RESEARCH.

02:33:54.725 --> 02:33:55.793
AND WE COULD SORT OF TO A LOOK

02:33:55.859 --> 02:33:56.827
BACK AT IT.

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:59.363
THE PROBLEM HERE IS AND YOU MAY

02:33:59.430 --> 02:34:01.532
YOU KNOW I I I UNDERSTAND WHAT

02:34:01.599 --> 02:34:02.099
YOU ARE TRYING TO DO IN GOOD

02:34:02.166 --> 02:34:02.433
FAITH.

02:34:02.499 --> 02:34:06.403
I I I DO APPRECIATE THAT AND AND

02:34:06.470 --> 02:34:08.839
FROM A WETLANDS PERSPECTIVE.

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:11.542
TO BACK TO MY TAKE IS A IT'S

02:34:11.609 --> 02:34:12.076
JUST IT'S IT'S SLIGHTLY.

02:34:12.142 --> 02:34:13.911
DIFFERENT JUST BECAUSE IF WE

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:15.779
SORT OF SAY YES AGAIN.

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:17.781
AND THEN HOPE THE INDUSTRY COMES

02:34:17.848 --> 02:34:18.916
UP WITH.

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:20.651
SOME ANSWERS.

02:34:20.718 --> 02:34:22.886
I KIND OF I'M NOT COMFORTABLE

02:34:22.953 --> 02:34:24.288
SORT OF BANKING ON THAT PROMISE

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:26.256
I'M IF THERE WAS A PRESENTATION

02:34:26.323 --> 02:34:27.358
FOR THE COMMITTEE FOR INSTANCE

02:34:27.424 --> 02:34:29.994
OF A NEW RFID CHIPS SYSTEM OR

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.395
SOME OTHER.

02:34:31.462 --> 02:34:32.429
SYSTEM THAT WAS ACTUALLY UP AND

02:34:32.496 --> 02:34:34.198
RUNNING TODAY TRACK AND TRACE

02:34:34.264 --> 02:34:35.799
READY -- I THINK WE MAY BE

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:37.101
HAVING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

02:34:37.167 --> 02:34:39.503
CONVERSATION ON THE ON THAT SORT

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:40.971
OF SPECIES DECLINE ISSUE THE

02:34:41.038 --> 02:34:42.740
PROBLEM IS NOW IF WE AUTHORIZES

02:34:42.806 --> 02:34:44.642
IN ITS CURRENT FORM.

02:34:44.708 --> 02:34:45.075
IT.

02:34:45.142 --> 02:34:46.977
WAS WE'RE SORT OF EVEN IF WE

02:34:47.044 --> 02:34:48.245
CONDITION DIDN'T SAID.

02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:50.581
IT CAME PROCEED BUT YOU KNOW THE

02:34:50.648 --> 02:34:52.416
INDUSTRY SHALL COME UP WITH SOME

02:34:52.483 --> 02:34:53.784
TRACKING STANDARD WE'RE STILL

02:34:53.851 --> 02:34:54.885
SORT OF MAKING A FOR LOOKING

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:56.220
PROMISE THAT WE DON'T REALLY

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:59.189
HAVE A GUARANTEE.

02:34:59.256 --> 02:35:00.724
WE CAN DEAL WITH.

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:01.925
THE TORTURE BECAUSE IT IS

02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:03.827
TORTURE WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN

02:35:03.894 --> 02:35:05.996
PLACE LIKE VIETNAM AND I'VE EVEN

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:08.699
HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT TEXAS --

02:35:08.766 --> 02:35:09.433
ENDS.

02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:11.035
I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE AND

02:35:11.101 --> 02:35:13.637
ALSO OVER PRESUME WHAT WE CAN DO

02:35:13.704 --> 02:35:14.538
ABOUT TEXAS LOUISIANA LET

02:35:14.605 --> 02:35:15.806
WEAPONS POLICY.

02:35:15.873 --> 02:35:17.541
BECAUSE THOSE STATE LEGISLATURES

02:35:17.608 --> 02:35:19.143
AND STATE GOVERNMENTS I THINK

02:35:19.209 --> 02:35:20.377
COULD BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT

02:35:20.444 --> 02:35:22.012
THAT BUT I'M SENSITIVE ALSO

02:35:22.079 --> 02:35:23.781
THESE CARBON SSUES THAT ARE

02:35:23.847 --> 02:35:24.648
RAISED HIM AND AGAIN.

02:35:24.715 --> 02:35:26.750
IF WE CAN SORT OF DO THAT FOR

02:35:26.817 --> 02:35:29.119
LOOKING ANALYSIS AND SAY OKAY IF

02:35:29.186 --> 02:35:30.587
WE REALLY START TO COLLAPSE FOR

02:35:30.654 --> 02:35:32.823
INSTANCE A WEAPONS PROGRAM FOR

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.692
RESEARCH PROGRAM LET'S TAKE A

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:36.794
SECOND LOOK AT IT -- AFTER THIS

02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:38.996
THIS BAN TAKES EFFECT BUT I I

02:35:39.063 --> 02:35:41.565
DON'T SEE THE HUGE RISK TODAY IN

02:35:41.632 --> 02:35:43.033
LETTING THAT BEEN.

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.269
GOING TO AFFECT STUDY THE

02:35:45.335 --> 02:35:47.304
IMPACTS -- OR FRANKLY HOLD THIS

02:35:47.371 --> 02:35:49.473
IN TAKE A LOOK AT IT NEXT YEAR

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:51.208
EVEN ONCE WE HAVE A LITTLE

02:35:51.275 --> 02:35:51.809
BETTER PERSPECTIVE SO I JUST

02:35:51.875 --> 02:35:53.677
WANTED.

02:35:53.744 --> 02:35:55.612
TO GET YOUR ALL'S TAKE ON IT.

02:35:55.679 --> 02:35:56.413
DO YOU THINK IT LEASE IS THAT

02:35:56.480 --> 02:35:57.581
FAIR MATH TO SAY IF I'M IF I'M

02:35:57.648 --> 02:35:58.949
SORT OF PROJECTING THE MAX

02:35:59.016 --> 02:36:05.589
IMPACT 25% FALL OFFER SO.

02:36:05.656 --> 02:36:07.758
THOSE RAID -- AND BY THE WAY

02:36:07.825 --> 02:36:09.226
THEY DO NOW SOUNDS POINTS AT 25%

02:36:09.293 --> 02:36:10.160
ILLEGAL SO IF IF WERE FALLING

02:36:10.227 --> 02:36:11.662
OFF TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.263
YEAH I DON'T MIND LOSING THAT

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:14.098
PORTION THE MARKET.

02:36:14.164 --> 02:36:15.666
YEAH PLEASE WRESTLING AND ALL OF

02:36:15.733 --> 02:36:18.235

THEY WHEN THEY EVERYONE.

02:36:20.771 --> 02:36:22.039
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME YES

02:36:22.106 --> 02:36:25.042
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE NEEDS --

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:26.710
TO TAKASU IT'S CAUCUS SIX RIGHT

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:28.112
THAT'S IMPORTANT STUFF.

I WOULD OFFER UP IN DRAWING MY

02:36:30.080 --> 02:36:32.216
ATTENTION.

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:33.417
TO SIR ALAN'S POINT ON THAT PAGE

02:36:33.484 --> 02:36:35.119
EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS IF WE GET

02:36:35.185 --> 02:36:36.687
TO THE FINAL PARAGRAPH.

02:36:36.754 --> 02:36:39.456
THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT --

02:36:39.523 --> 02:36:41.325
MISTER CRAVEN HAS OFFERED UP --

02:36:41.391 --> 02:36:42.659
THAT YOU KNOW PERHAPS WE SHOULD

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:44.561
HOLD THE BILL UNTIL THIS

02:36:44.628 --> 02:36:45.462
DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM IT'S

02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:46.230
ARTS ARE.

02:36:46.296 --> 02:36:47.297
AT AND THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT

02:36:47.364 --> 02:36:47.798
YOU'RE HIT NON AND WHAT

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:49.633
GUARANTEED WE HAVE AND AND WE'RE

02:36:49.700 --> 02:36:50.367

02:36:50.434 --> 02:36:51.335
EXTENSION.

02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:53.003
I WOULD OFFER MAYBE WE START BY

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:57.541
CUTTING THE TIME IN HALF -- YOU

02:36:57.608 --> 02:36:59.443
KNOW.

02:36:59.510 --> 02:37:00.344
TO AS FAR AS THE SUNSET

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.712
EXTENSION -- WITH A LEGISLATIVE

02:37:01.779 --> 02:37:03.514
REVIEW -- AND SOME KIND OF SIGN

02:37:03.580 --> 02:37:04.548
OFFER MANDATE MAYBE WITH THE

02:37:04.615 --> 02:37:07.351
FISH AND WILDLIFE -- SO THAT WAS

02:37:07.417 --> 02:37:07.985
WHAT WE SAID A MARKER BECAUSE I

02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:10.320
DO AGREE DEADLINES DRIVE.

02:37:10.387 --> 02:37:12.389
RESULTS RIGHT AND WE'VE SEEN

02:37:12.456 --> 02:37:13.624
THAT HERE IN LEGISLATURE -- WERE

02:37:13.690 --> 02:37:16.593
DEADLINE DRIVEN -- BODY SO LET'S

02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:18.962
USE THIS VEHICLE TO YOU KNOW

02:37:19.029 --> 02:37:19.730
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE HERE SO TO

02:37:19.797 --> 02:37:20.931
SPEAK AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:23.233
THAT I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING

02:37:23.300 --> 02:37:25.002
FORTH AND SURROUNDS PUTTING

02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:30.174
FORTH AND SIR HERTZBERG. TO IN

02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:32.109
FACT YOU KNOW CALL THE CALL THE

02:37:32.176 --> 02:37:34.077
QUESTION AND REQUIRE SYSTEM TO

02:37:34.144 --> 02:37:35.012
PUT IN PLACE IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:37:35.078 --> 02:37:35.712
FOR THAT RIGHT AND ALSO MAYBE

02:37:35.779 --> 02:37:36.346
SET A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:36.980
MIGHT BE APPLICABLE OUTSIDE OF

02:37:37.047 --> 02:37:39.316
JUST -- THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES

02:37:39.383 --> 02:37:39.850
RIGHT I THINK THAT'S AN

02:37:39.917 --> 02:37:41.618
IMPORTANT -- IT'S IMPORTANT

02:37:41.685 --> 02:37:42.886
STANDARD THAT MAYBE HAS BROADER

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.088
IMPLICATIONS FOR THIS BODY AND

02:37:45.155 --> 02:37:47.191
IN A VARIETY OF BILLS SO WOULD

02:37:47.257 --> 02:37:49.793
BE COMMITTEE ENTERTAIN.

02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:51.161
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

02:37:51.228 --> 02:37:52.830
I I THINK I'D BE INTERESTED IN

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:55.232
IN A NARROW APPLICATION TO DEAL

02:37:55.299 --> 02:37:57.334
WITH THIS RESEARCH ISSUE BECAUSE

02:37:57.401 --> 02:37:59.002
I AM SENSE OF THOSE GAPS.

02:37:59.069 --> 02:38:00.938
BUT I THINK THE DEADLINE IS

02:38:01.004 --> 02:38:02.105
ALREADY IN LAW FOR THE

02:38:02.172 --> 02:38:03.507
COMMERCIAL MARKET TO DO THEIR

02:38:03.574 --> 02:38:05.108
THING I MEAN HERE IT IS CLOCKS

02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:08.812
TAKEN ON THE END OF THIS YEAR --

02:38:08.879 --> 02:38:10.581
AND SO.

02:38:10.647 --> 02:38:12.850
I I THINK THE LAW ITSELF ALLOWS

02:38:12.916 --> 02:38:14.918
THAT DEADLINE I MEAN IF IF YOU

02:38:14.985 --> 02:38:16.854
COME IN WITH THAT TRACK AND

02:38:16.920 --> 02:38:18.722
TRACE PROGRAMMING IT'S THAT'S

02:38:18.789 --> 02:38:21.358
ONE THING BUT YEAH I I SEE THE

02:38:21.425 --> 02:38:22.893
DEADLINE IS BEING THERE.

02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.828
I WOULD I BE OPEN TO THIS THIS

02:38:24.895 --> 02:38:26.363
MEDICAL RESEARCH CONCEPT OF SO

02:38:26.430 --> 02:38:28.899
FAR WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN HAD

02:38:28.966 --> 02:38:29.600
AS TAYLOR.

02:38:29.666 --> 02:38:32.302
HAD THAT ISSUE IN PARTICULAR BUT

02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:33.704
YES I THINK I WOULD RESPECTFULLY

02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:34.705
DISAGREE MATURED SAY THAT WE

02:38:34.771 --> 02:38:36.440
HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED IN ANY

02:38:36.506 --> 02:38:38.575
PREVIOUS LEGISLATION -- THE GOAL

02:38:38.642 --> 02:38:40.010
OF TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM BY

02:38:40.077 --> 02:38:41.311
THIS DATE RIGHT WE'VE GOT WE'VE

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:42.479
NOT LAY DOWN THE MARKET I

02:38:42.546 --> 02:38:44.147
UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT IS WE'VE

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:45.148
GOT A LONG WAY OKAY FINE.

02:38:45.215 --> 02:38:46.650
YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:38:46.717 --> 02:38:48.719
RIGHT EXTENSION IS I DO KNOW

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:50.387
THAT DISRUPTING.

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:51.622
PRIVATE MARKETS DOESN'T SERVE

02:38:51.688 --> 02:38:53.156
ANYONE YOU KNOW THESE IMPORTANT

02:38:53.223 --> 02:38:54.758
REVENUES THAT -- JUST LIKE THEY

02:38:54.825 --> 02:38:56.260
DO IN MY HOME DISTRICTS.

02:38:56.326 --> 02:38:59.229
HELPS PRESERVE AND SECURE THESE --

02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:01.498
THESE WETLANDS AND THAT HAS.

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:04.801
BENEFITS THAT WE'VE ALL TALKED

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:07.271
ABOUT -- SO WE WOULDN'T WANT TO

02:39:07.337 --> 02:39:08.305
DISRUPT THE MARKET IN SAYING

02:39:08.372 --> 02:39:09.573
WE'RE GONNA STOP AND WE MIGHT

02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:10.841
REINSTATE IT LATER -- YOU KNOW

02:39:10.908 --> 02:39:12.342
AS MUCH AS WE FIND OURSELVES TO

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:14.478
BE -- HONORABLE UNPREDICTABLE

02:39:14.544 --> 02:39:15.579
PRIVATE SECTOR MARKETS DON'T

02:39:15.646 --> 02:39:16.914
ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO TAKE FROM

02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:18.181
OUR ACTIONS AND SO WE HAVE TO BE

02:39:18.248 --> 02:39:20.250
CAREFUL AND IN IN HOW WE WE

02:39:20.317 --> 02:39:22.185
PROCEED THERE BUT SOME BRIEF

02:39:22.252 --> 02:39:24.254
EXTENSION OF TIME I WOULD OFFER

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.956
UP TO CUT THE TIME IN HALF.

02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:27.691
BUT PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE HAS A

02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:28.992
DIFFERENT OPINION THAN THAT BUT

02:39:29.059 --> 02:39:32.029
SOME EXTENSION WITH THE ABSOLUTE

02:39:32.095 --> 02:39:33.730
MANDATE THAT YOU HAVE TO ACHIEVE

02:39:33.797 --> 02:39:37.234
THIS -- TECHNOLOGICAL CAPABILITY

02:39:37.301 --> 02:39:38.402
BY THE STATE PERIOD RIGHT AND WE

02:39:38.468 --> 02:39:39.703
SET THE MARKET THE LEGISLATURE

02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:40.570
SENT A MESSAGE AND WE'VE

02:39:40.637 --> 02:39:42.272
ACHIEVED MULTIPLE PUBLIC POLICY

02:39:42.339 --> 02:39:43.473
GOALS WHICH I WOULD TAKE THE

02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:46.610
COMMITTEE FOR THAT -- GUIDANCE

02:39:46.677 --> 02:39:48.779
AND DIRECTION OKAY -- I'D BE

02:39:48.845 --> 02:39:49.947
WILLING TO LOOK AT THE STUDYING

02:39:50.013 --> 02:39:52.316
OF MARKET DISRUPTION BECAUSE I I

02:39:52.382 --> 02:39:54.518
AM AGAIN SENSITIVE NOT JUST TO

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:56.286
THE MEDICAL RESEARCH BUT ALSO

02:39:56.353 --> 02:39:58.288
THE WETLANDS PIECE.

02:39:58.355 --> 02:39:59.589
AND MEMBERS ARE WELCOME.

02:39:59.656 --> 02:40:01.291
TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN

02:40:01.358 --> 02:40:03.860
DISCRETION -- YEAH I I I DON'T

02:40:03.927 --> 02:40:05.662
WANT TO PUT TOO HEAVY OF A THUMB

02:40:05.729 --> 02:40:08.165
ON THE SCALE HERE -- BUT I WOULD

02:40:08.231 --> 02:40:10.500
JUST SAY -- I'D BE MORE

02:40:10.567 --> 02:40:12.135
COMFORTABLE.

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:13.637
WAITING AND SEEING.

02:40:13.704 --> 02:40:15.405
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND NOT

02:40:15.472 --> 02:40:17.407
TRYING TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IN

02:40:17.474 --> 02:40:18.909
SOME BIG COLLAPSE HERE AND

02:40:18.976 --> 02:40:20.043
SEEING IF IT IS TRULY THAT

02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:21.445
CATASTROPHIC FRIENDS IS ON THE

02:40:21.511 --> 02:40:22.579
WETLAND SIDE ON THE MEDICAL

02:40:22.646 --> 02:40:23.647
RESEARCH SIDE?

02:40:23.714 --> 02:40:27.417
AND REVISITING IT NEXT YEAR --

02:40:27.484 --> 02:40:29.119
SO I'M SURE THEY'LL BE THAT OR

02:40:29.186 --> 02:40:30.587
TRYING TO ACTUALLY PUT IN PLACE --

02:40:30.654 --> 02:40:36.393
BEFORE LIKE BEFORE WE DO RE OPEN.

02:40:36.460 --> 02:40:36.994
DOING THIS SORT OF TRACK AND

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:37.728
TRACE PROGRAM SO JUST SORT OF

02:40:37.794 --> 02:40:38.295
FLIPPING THE ORDER IN OTHER

02:40:38.362 --> 02:40:40.831
WORDS -- CONDITIONING THE

02:40:40.897 --> 02:40:43.266
EXTENSION ON THE SORT OF

02:40:43.333 --> 02:40:45.335
SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION TO

02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:46.570
TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM.

02:40:46.636 --> 02:40:49.239
IN ADVANCE OF ANY -- OPENING BUT

02:40:49.306 --> 02:40:50.841
THAT SOME YOU KNOW SOME FINING

02:40:50.907 --> 02:40:52.442
OR PRESENTATION AFTER YOU MADE

02:40:52.509 --> 02:40:53.844
I'M JUST NOT COMFORTABLE WITH

02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:55.012
THIS SORT OPEN ENDED NATURE OF

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:57.514
IT DOING IT IN THAT ORDER.

02:40:57.581 --> 02:41:00.050
I GUESS THAT'S THE THAT'S THE

02:41:00.117 --> 02:41:01.084
ESSENCE OF MY CONCERN.

02:41:01.151 --> 02:41:02.819
YOU CAN GO OUT YEAH JUST EXPLAIN

02:41:02.886 --> 02:41:04.287
THE PRO TEMPORE TRYING TO WORK

02:41:04.354 --> 02:41:06.056
ON IT.

02:41:06.123 --> 02:41:08.892
SO -- DO WE WANT TO TRY TO THINK

02:41:08.959 --> 02:41:11.628
PROCEDURALLY HOW TO HOW BEST TO

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:13.897
DO THIS -- DO WE WANT TO LEAVE

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:17.367
THE MEASURE ON ON HOLD AND TALK

02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:18.101
THIS THROUGH DO WE HAVE ANY

02:41:18.168 --> 02:41:19.369
PERSPECTIVES ON I MEAN THIS THIS

02:41:19.436 --> 02:41:20.537
NARAL.

02:41:20.604 --> 02:41:22.139
MEDICAL RESEARCH ISSUE SEEMS

02:41:22.205 --> 02:41:26.109
SOLVABLE -- I JUST I'M NOT

02:41:26.176 --> 02:41:28.678
WILLING TO OPEN UP.

02:41:28.745 --> 02:41:30.213
A VERY TOUGH TO REGULATE

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.416
COMMERCIAL MARKET WITH.

02:41:32.482 --> 02:41:34.017
INDISTINGUISHABLE PRODUCTS

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:35.619
COMING DOWN.

02:41:35.685 --> 02:41:38.622
HAVE PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THIS.

02:41:38.688 --> 02:41:41.958
THE CORE OF WHERE THEY COME FROM --

02:41:42.025 --> 02:41:48.165
AS A STATE IT IS IT'S TOO MUCH --

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:50.834
SO SHERMAN YEAH PLEASE I'M A

02:41:50.901 --> 02:41:52.035
LITTLE CONFUSED.

02:41:52.102 --> 02:41:53.470
LVM LEASE UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:41:53.537 --> 02:41:56.640
YOU'RE COMING FROM IF IN FACT WE

02:41:56.706 --> 02:41:58.875
HAD A EXTENSION IT WAS A SHORTER

02:41:58.942 --> 02:41:59.476
PERIOD OF TIME THE FIVE YEARS

02:41:59.543 --> 02:42:00.610
AND IF IN FACT WE MANDATED THIS

02:42:00.677 --> 02:42:01.711
TRACK AND TRACE TECHNOLOGY.

02:42:01.778 --> 02:42:03.680
BY THAT SUCH DATE WHATEVER THAT

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:05.515
DATE -- THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.517
DECIDE DOES THAT MEET YOUR

02:42:07.584 --> 02:42:09.119
METRIC OR YOU SAYING YOU KNOW

02:42:09.186 --> 02:42:12.055
I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT I'M

02:42:12.122 --> 02:42:13.824
SAYING WE COULD DO.

02:42:13.890 --> 02:42:14.424
I'D BE INTERESTED IN GETTING

02:42:14.491 --> 02:42:16.093
TRACK AND TRACE UP BEFORE ANY

02:42:16.159 --> 02:42:17.494
EXTENSION OCCURRED BUT WE DON'T

02:42:17.561 --> 02:42:18.695
HAVE TRACK AND TRACE TODAY AND

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:20.730
THE EXTENT EXPIRES NOW SO THAT

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:21.932
OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE RIGHT.

02:42:21.998 --> 02:42:23.967
WELL I I MEAN I I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:42:24.034 --> 02:42:25.335
QUICKLY INDUSTRY I MEAN I DON'T

02:42:25.402 --> 02:42:27.370
KNOW IF IS IS A SIX MONTH PERIOD

02:42:27.437 --> 02:42:28.271
BEFORE YOU CAN GET SOMETHING UP

02:42:28.338 --> 02:42:30.307
AND RUNNING I I'M NOT SURE WHAT

02:42:30.373 --> 02:42:32.042
TIME LINES ARE ACTUALLY LIKE

02:42:32.109 --> 02:42:32.642
THERE SO.

02:42:32.709 --> 02:42:37.047
SO MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GELANG

02:42:37.114 --> 02:42:37.547
REPRESENTING THE FARMING

02:42:37.614 --> 02:42:38.315
INDUSTRY.

02:42:38.381 --> 02:42:39.049
VARIOUS TECHNOLOGIES ARE

02:42:39.116 --> 02:42:42.252
CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED.

02:42:42.319 --> 02:42:43.787
WHAT'S BEEN MISSING QUITE

02:42:43.854 --> 02:42:45.388
FRANKLY IS.

02:42:45.455 --> 02:42:47.257
A GOVERNMENT SANCTIONED FOR

02:42:47.324 --> 02:42:49.426
THOSE COMPANIES TO COOPERATE AND

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:52.362
COLLABORATE WITHOUT FEAR OF ANTI

02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:53.663
TRUST ARE OTHER CONCERNS. TO

02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:56.032
ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:57.134
TOGETHER UNDERSTANDING THE

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.302
YELLOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:42:59.369 --> 02:43:01.004
MAKE THAT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE

02:43:01.071 --> 02:43:02.472
NOT JUST TO THEMSELVES BUT TO

02:43:02.539 --> 02:43:04.274
THE FOREIGN FIFTY SMALL

02:43:04.341 --> 02:43:06.710
MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:43:06.776 --> 02:43:08.078
WHO NEED THAT TECHNOLOGY

02:43:08.145 --> 02:43:08.378
[inaudible]

02:43:08.445 --> 02:43:10.213
I THINK.

02:43:10.280 --> 02:43:13.283
WE'RE PREPARED TO HAVE OUR FEET.

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:15.485
TO THE FIRE. TO MAKE THIS

02:43:15.552 --> 02:43:17.921
TECHNOLOGY REALITY EACH

02:43:17.988 --> 02:43:19.389
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING.

02:43:19.456 --> 02:43:20.891
DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW HAS

02:43:20.957 --> 02:43:22.792
DIFFERENT ISSUES FIGHT EACH

02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:24.027
TECHNOLOGY HAS.

02:43:24.094 --> 02:43:26.296
HAS SOME CAPABILITY BUT ALSO

02:43:26.363 --> 02:43:27.497
SOME DOWNSIDES.

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:28.832
THE INDUSTRY KNOWS THAT THIS

02:43:28.899 --> 02:43:29.966
MUST HAPPEN A MUST HAPPEN

02:43:30.033 --> 02:43:32.969
QUICKLY I THINK PROVIDING THAT

02:43:33.036 --> 02:43:35.739
BOTH INCENTIVE AND AND WORKING

02:43:35.805 --> 02:43:37.741
WITH THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO

02:43:37.807 --> 02:43:40.510
COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE NGOS.

02:43:40.577 --> 02:43:41.912
DEVELOP THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY AND

02:43:41.978 --> 02:43:43.914
MAKE SURE IT WORKS WE'RE READY

02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:45.048
TO DO WERE READY TO HAVE OUR

02:43:45.115 --> 02:43:46.216
FEET PUT TO THE FIRE.

02:43:46.283 --> 02:43:48.218
WE JUST NEED THE CONTEXT IN

02:43:48.285 --> 02:43:49.486
WHICH TO DO THAT WITHOUT.

02:43:49.553 --> 02:43:52.455
PULLING OUT THE UNDERPINNING OF

02:43:52.522 --> 02:43:54.858
THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT

02:43:54.925 --> 02:43:55.158
[inaudible]

02:43:55.225 --> 02:43:57.260
UNDERSTOOD I I THINK WE'RE

02:43:57.327 --> 02:44:00.764
HAVING A SORT OF ALLIGATOR THE

02:44:00.830 --> 02:44:01.865
EGGS.

02:44:01.932 --> 02:44:04.935
WHICH COMES FIRST -- DISCUSSION

02:44:05.001 --> 02:44:07.737
IN AND SO.

02:44:07.804 --> 02:44:09.439
I'M IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT

02:44:09.506 --> 02:44:12.275
THERE'S OPEN IS.

02:44:12.342 --> 02:44:14.377
TO SPEEDING UP IN FIGURING OUT A

02:44:14.444 --> 02:44:15.979
TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM.

02:44:16.046 --> 02:44:17.480
TIMELINE WISE [inaudible]

02:44:17.547 --> 02:44:19.950
DON'T.

02:44:20.016 --> 02:44:21.618
GIVE US YOUR SENSE OF IT WITH

02:44:21.685 --> 02:44:22.385
THIS GOVERNMENT SANCTION I MEAN

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:23.887
IF WE IF THIS BILL WAS FOR

02:44:23.954 --> 02:44:25.889
INSTANCE TO SAY.

02:44:25.956 --> 02:44:26.590
JUST SETTING UP A TRACK AND

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:27.390
TRACE PROGAM THAT WAS THE

02:44:27.457 --> 02:44:28.758
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL.

02:44:28.825 --> 02:44:32.329
AND THEN CONDITIONING ANY.

02:44:32.395 --> 02:44:36.733
EXTENSION OF THE BANDS.

02:44:36.800 --> 02:44:39.269
REVERSAL -- ABATEMENT.

02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:41.972
ON THE THAT SORT OF GOVERNMENT

02:44:42.038 --> 02:44:43.506
SANCTIONING.

02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:45.342
THROUGH SORT OF NOT DOING THE

02:44:45.408 --> 02:44:46.309
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AS THE TIME

02:44:46.376 --> 02:44:47.944
AS THE SHOT CLOCK BUT INTO THIS

02:44:48.011 --> 02:44:49.379
YEAR IS THE SHOT CLOCK.

02:44:49.446 --> 02:44:55.585
BUT THAT WE WOULD OR WHATEVER

02:44:55.652 --> 02:44:57.220
YOU WANNA CALL CONSISTENCY TO

02:44:57.287 --> 02:45:00.924
SOME DETERMINATION BUT THEN --

02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:02.993
ALLOWED.

02:45:03.059 --> 02:45:03.860
TO LOOK AT TWO AND A HALF OR

02:45:03.927 --> 02:45:05.895
EVEN FIVE I MEAN I I THINK I'M I

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:07.197
THINK IF IF I FELT CERTAIN I

02:45:07.264 --> 02:45:08.331
THINK TO BE A LOT MORE OPENNESS

02:45:08.398 --> 02:45:08.598
I THINK.

02:45:08.665 --> 02:45:10.567
I MIGHT SUGGEST CENTER THAT --

02:45:10.634 --> 02:45:12.168
IF WE WERE GOING TO ESTABLISH A

02:45:12.235 --> 02:45:13.870
TRACK AND TRACE PROBLEM IF THAT

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:14.838
WERE POSSIBLE BY THE END OF THIS

02:45:14.904 --> 02:45:15.538
YEAR.

02:45:15.605 --> 02:45:16.773
YOU JUST LEFT THE SUNSET ALL THE

02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.141
ALL TOGETHER I WOULD UNDERSTAND

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:19.943
THE NEED FOR A SUNSET TO SUNSET

02:45:20.010 --> 02:45:21.177
WOULD BE TO DRIVE THE DEADLINE

02:45:21.244 --> 02:45:22.712
WILL BE TO DRIVE THE BEHAVIOR

02:45:22.779 --> 02:45:24.614
RIGHT SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

02:45:24.681 --> 02:45:25.782
BEYOND X. DATE.

02:45:25.849 --> 02:45:27.717
WITHOUT IMPLEMENTING X. PROGRAM

02:45:27.784 --> 02:45:29.286
AND OF COURSE WE AND WE PUT

02:45:29.352 --> 02:45:30.920
SUNSET DATES INTO LEGISLATION

02:45:30.987 --> 02:45:32.355
FOR LEGISLATIVE REVIEW THAT'S

02:45:32.422 --> 02:45:34.157
EXACTLY THE PURPOSE.

02:45:34.224 --> 02:45:36.159
IF WE ACHIEVED THE OUTCOME OR

02:45:36.226 --> 02:45:37.394
LOOKING FOR WE COULD PULL THE

02:45:37.460 --> 02:45:38.461
SUNSET ALL TOGETHER I DON'T

02:45:38.528 --> 02:45:40.030
THINK ESPECIALLY THE INTEREST I

02:45:40.096 --> 02:45:41.798
I PREFER THE IDEA OF KEEPING THE

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:42.766
SUNSET IN PLACE.

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:44.434
FOR PERPETUAL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW

02:45:44.501 --> 02:45:45.502
AS YOU MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE

02:45:45.568 --> 02:45:46.936
GOOD PRACTICES AND BEST

02:45:47.003 --> 02:45:47.804
PRACTICES OR NOT BUT LET'S SET A

02:45:47.871 --> 02:45:50.340
GOAL TODAY THAT WE CAN FORCE THE

02:45:50.407 --> 02:45:53.410
INDUSTRY. TO GET THE STRUCTURES

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:54.077
THE AND IF THAT'S NOT THE END OF

02:45:54.144 --> 02:45:55.412
THE YEAR -- IF IT'S NOT TWO AND

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:56.813
A HALF YEARS FROM NOW WHAT IS IT

02:45:56.880 --> 02:45:59.883
IS IT IS IT YOU KNOW JANUARY.

02:45:59.949 --> 02:46:02.719
TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS A JANUARY --

02:46:02.786 --> 02:46:04.054
TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS JERRY TORRE

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:05.588
TWENTY THREE I DON'T KNOW WOULD

02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:11.661
BE OPEN TO THE IMPORTANT TO ME

02:46:11.728 --> 02:46:12.295
BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A NICE

02:46:12.362 --> 02:46:14.531
LANDING SPOT -- CAUCUS IN TIME

02:46:14.597 --> 02:46:15.598
IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS OPEN

02:46:15.665 --> 02:46:18.134
ENDED FOR SOME DISCUSSION AMONG

02:46:18.201 --> 02:46:19.836

02:46:19.903 --> 02:46:21.971
VOTE ONLY.

02:46:22.038 --> 02:46:23.373
AND KICKING THE TIRES LOW FOR

02:46:23.440 --> 02:46:23.940
THE HERE BUT BUT JUST TO BE

02:46:24.007 --> 02:46:24.574
CLEAR ABOUT MY BOTTOM LINE I'M

02:46:24.641 --> 02:46:25.909
NOT JUST WILLING TO GO.

02:46:25.975 --> 02:46:29.913
ON GOOD FAITH OPEN ENDED HERE AT

THINK IF A WORD ABOUT THE

02:46:32.248 --> 02:46:33.283
MEDICAL RESEARCH PIECE.

02:46:33.350 --> 02:46:34.851
I THINK WE CAN SOLVE THAT HERE

02:46:34.918 --> 02:46:36.219
TODAY -- ACT I REALLY DO THINK

02:46:36.286 --> 02:46:38.421
IT'S DOABLE IF THAT IS THE

02:46:38.488 --> 02:46:41.257
NARROW ISSUE WELL.

02:46:41.324 --> 02:46:42.992
IF I MAY AT LEAST I AGREE.

02:46:43.059 --> 02:46:44.361
THIS PLACE IS ABOUT HURRY UP

02:46:44.427 --> 02:46:45.895
THING WAITING THAT'S BEEN MY

02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:47.630
EXPERIENCE HERE AND NOTHING

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:48.998
HAPPENS UNLESS THERE'S SOLID

02:46:49.065 --> 02:46:50.700
DEADLINES AND YOU ARE CORRECT

02:46:50.767 --> 02:46:51.935
BUT THAT IN I AGREE WITH --

02:46:52.001 --> 02:46:54.237
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY THAT IF WE

02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:55.538
EXTENDED THE SUNSET IN BY.

02:46:55.605 --> 02:46:57.407
WHATEVER DAY WE DECIDE THAT'S

02:46:57.474 --> 02:46:59.576
NOT DONE THEN THIS BILL THE US

02:46:59.642 --> 02:47:02.112
SUNSET IS ENACTED SOLD NOTHING.

02:47:02.178 --> 02:47:03.380
IN THIS HOUSE OR IN THIS

02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:05.215
BUILDING HAPPENS WITHOUT THOSE

02:47:05.281 --> 02:47:06.516
DEADLINES AND SO IF WE CAN.

02:47:06.583 --> 02:47:09.386
EXTEND AGAIN EITHER TWENTY

02:47:09.452 --> 02:47:10.019
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY

02:47:10.086 --> 02:47:10.687
THREE WHAT WHATEVER'S A PLEASURE

02:47:10.754 --> 02:47:12.889
OF THE COMMITTEE BUT IF THAT IS

02:47:12.956 --> 02:47:14.724
THE TRACKING SYSTEM IS NOT IN

02:47:14.791 --> 02:47:16.693
PLACE BY EX STATE.

02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:19.662
THAN THAN BAD VOIGTS THAT THAT

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:20.296
EXTENSION.

02:47:20.363 --> 02:47:21.598
YEAH I GUESS I'M TALKING ABOUT

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:22.632
THE REVERSE ORDER THAT IS HAVING

02:47:22.699 --> 02:47:24.300
TRACK AND TRACE THEN LOOK IN THE

02:47:24.367 --> 02:47:26.035
EXTENSION IS DOING EXTENSION

02:47:26.102 --> 02:47:26.970
THEN LOOKING AT WITH ALL DUE

02:47:27.036 --> 02:47:27.237
RESPECT.

02:47:27.303 --> 02:47:28.705
MR STERN YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT

02:47:28.772 --> 02:47:29.806
IT IS TO TO GO THROUGH THESE

02:47:29.873 --> 02:47:31.708
TYPES OF POLICIES AND TRYING TO

02:47:31.775 --> 02:47:32.976
GET IT BACK ON HERE.

02:47:33.042 --> 02:47:35.311
BECAUSE I THE OPPOSITION IS NOT

02:47:35.378 --> 02:47:36.479
WORRIED ABOUT THE TRACK

02:47:36.546 --> 02:47:37.847
INTRIGUED TRACK AND TRACE OTHER

02:47:37.914 --> 02:47:39.682
THERE'S OTHER ISSUES AND SO SO

02:47:39.749 --> 02:47:41.384
SO ONCE THIS IS GONE TRYING TO

02:47:41.451 --> 02:47:43.553
GET IT BACK ON IS NEARLY.

02:47:43.620 --> 02:47:44.988
IMPOSSIBLE YOU KNOW THAT IN A

02:47:45.054 --> 02:47:47.824
AND WE KNOW THAT AND AND IF.

02:47:47.891 --> 02:47:49.092
ABSOLUTELY WE'RE HERE AND THAT'S

02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:50.660
THE POINT RIGHT SO THAT WE CAN

02:47:50.727 --> 02:47:52.095
COME TO A COMPROMISE THE

02:47:52.162 --> 02:47:53.496
OPPOSITION IS NOT WILLING TO

02:47:53.563 --> 02:47:55.331
COMPROMISE IF THERE IS A AN

02:47:55.398 --> 02:47:56.533
EXTENSION AND THAT'S WHY.

02:47:56.599 --> 02:47:57.967
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE

02:47:58.034 --> 02:47:59.335
AND FOR YOU TO MAKE THESE

02:47:59.402 --> 02:48:00.236
DECISIONS AND THAT'S THE

02:48:00.303 --> 02:48:02.705
COMPROMISE THAT WE ARE ASKING

02:48:02.772 --> 02:48:03.773
FOR SO THAT IF THIS DOESN'T

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:06.109
HAPPEN IT SATISFIES YOUR YOUR

02:48:06.176 --> 02:48:06.976
REQUEST.

02:48:07.043 --> 02:48:09.546
RIGHT IF BY EX DATE IT'S NOT

02:48:09.612 --> 02:48:11.614
DONE THEN THIS THIS IS COMPLETE

02:48:11.681 --> 02:48:12.549
BILLS WHATEVER THE TWO YEARS TWO

02:48:12.615 --> 02:48:13.016
AND A HALF.

02:48:13.082 --> 02:48:15.051
IS COMPLETELY GONE I THINK THAT

02:48:15.118 --> 02:48:17.387
WOULD DRIVE THE THE URGENCY

02:48:17.454 --> 02:48:20.223
WOULD DRIVE DOWN THE INDUSTRY TO

02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:20.790
COME UP WITH THAT TRACK AND

02:48:20.857 --> 02:48:24.727
TRACE PROGRAM.

02:48:24.794 --> 02:48:26.529
I APPRECIATE THAT -- IT FEELS

02:48:26.596 --> 02:48:29.098
PRETTY URGENT TO THEM RIGHT NOW.

02:48:29.165 --> 02:48:31.401
THEY'RE ALL HERE -- AND SO.

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:32.936
AT THIS POINT.

02:48:33.002 --> 02:48:34.971
I WANT TO SEE I MEAN IS MY

02:48:35.038 --> 02:48:36.039
PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE JUST THE

02:48:36.105 --> 02:48:37.640
PERSPECTIVE OF ONE MEMBER HERE

02:48:37.707 --> 02:48:40.910
BUT I THINK THE DEADLINE WE'VE

02:48:40.977 --> 02:48:42.111
GOTTEN LAW IS THE DRIVER.

02:48:42.178 --> 02:48:44.013
I'M HAPPY TO MAKE THIS A TRACK

02:48:44.080 --> 02:48:45.715
AND TRACE STUDY BILL.

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:48.852
OR BUT ALSO RESEARCH MIL BUT

02:48:48.918 --> 02:48:50.186
MISTER TEN RESIDENT YOU CAN

02:48:50.253 --> 02:48:51.621
SPEND SOME TIME IF YOU WANT

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:55.658
DURING RECESS WHEN WE GO OFF AND

02:48:55.725 --> 02:48:56.059
DO SOME THINKING.

02:48:56.125 --> 02:48:58.495
BUT THE AGAIN THE GOOD FAITH

02:48:58.561 --> 02:49:00.263
LIKE TAKE ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF

02:49:00.330 --> 02:49:02.599
AND FIGURED OUT THAT IF IT WORKS.

02:49:02.665 --> 02:49:03.166
NINE WERE FROM GAIN BUT OUT

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:04.434
AGAIN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WE

02:49:04.501 --> 02:49:08.104
DID CALL WE CALL THE OPPOSITION

02:49:08.171 --> 02:49:08.671
FOR STAKEHOLDER MEETING AND

02:49:08.738 --> 02:49:09.973
NOBODY SHOWED UP.

02:49:10.039 --> 02:49:11.374
SO SO YOU'RE PUTTING ON THESE

02:49:11.441 --> 02:49:13.176
YOU KNOW THESE REQUIREMENTS BUT

02:49:13.243 --> 02:49:14.711
WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT AT THE TABLE

02:49:14.777 --> 02:49:16.145
WE CAN'T HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS

02:49:16.212 --> 02:49:17.814
THE SHERMAN OCCURRED BEFORE EVEN

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:21.084
I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:22.151
THAT WE AT LEAST BE AFFORDED.

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:23.987
THE DURATION OF THE SESSION TO

02:49:24.053 --> 02:49:26.155
WORK ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT AND A

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:31.160
IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

02:49:31.227 --> 02:49:32.929
OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH THIS

02:49:32.996 --> 02:49:35.865
EXPIRES RIGHT IF WE EXTENDED IT

02:49:35.932 --> 02:49:38.134
TO JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE

02:49:38.201 --> 02:49:41.137
WE WOULD -- HAVE IN PLACE A

02:49:41.204 --> 02:49:42.672
ALMOST AS URGENT DEADLINE IS

02:49:42.739 --> 02:49:46.376
ONLY ONE YEAR -- ADDITIONAL TIME --

02:49:46.442 --> 02:49:47.710
MAYBE WE COULD WORK SOME

02:49:47.777 --> 02:49:48.945
COOPERATION THEM WITH FISH AND

02:49:49.012 --> 02:49:51.314
WILDLIFE AND HAVE THE DIRECTOR

02:49:51.381 --> 02:49:55.051
PLAY SOME ROLE IN -- IN YOU KNOW.

02:49:55.118 --> 02:49:56.819
MONITORING THE PROGRESS AND A

02:49:56.886 --> 02:49:58.454
AND AN ADDRESS THAT BUT I THINK.

02:49:58.521 --> 02:49:59.556
YOU KNOW.

02:49:59.622 --> 02:50:00.490
UNLESS THE INDUSTRY'S PREPARED

02:50:00.557 --> 02:50:01.824
TO TELL US TODAY THAT THEY CAN

02:50:01.891 --> 02:50:03.393
HAVE A TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM

02:50:03.459 --> 02:50:04.961
IN PLACE BY JANUARY TWENTY

02:50:05.028 --> 02:50:05.695
TWENTY WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE

02:50:05.762 --> 02:50:07.163
THEY ARE IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH

02:50:07.230 --> 02:50:08.665
THE INDUSTRY AND I'LL LET THEM

02:50:08.731 --> 02:50:09.666
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

02:50:09.732 --> 02:50:12.001
I THINK A A MINIMUM ONE YEAR I

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:15.605
WOULD SAY TWO YEARS -- TO TWENTY

02:50:15.672 --> 02:50:17.006
TWENTY TWO TWITTER TO BUT GIVEN

02:50:17.073 --> 02:50:18.541
YOU KNOW YOUR STRONG FEELINGS

02:50:18.608 --> 02:50:20.310
THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN.

02:50:20.376 --> 02:50:21.210
THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE AND I

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:22.912
DON'T I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOUR

02:50:22.979 --> 02:50:24.847
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT -- PERHAPS A

02:50:24.914 --> 02:50:26.115
WHEN YOUR SCHEDULE ALLOWS TO

02:50:26.182 --> 02:50:27.383
MOVE FORWARD WE COULD STICK TO

02:50:27.450 --> 02:50:28.051
TRACK AND TRACE LANGUAGE AND WE

02:50:28.117 --> 02:50:29.052
COULD.

02:50:29.118 --> 02:50:30.019
ENGAGE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

02:50:30.086 --> 02:50:31.588
FISH AND WILDLIFE AND AND REALLY

02:50:31.654 --> 02:50:33.089
START TO SET A MODEL THAT WOULD

02:50:33.156 --> 02:50:34.557
SERVE THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:37.293
LEGISLATURE ON OTHER BILLS AS

02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:37.660
WELL.

02:50:37.727 --> 02:50:38.928
IN CASE GET SOME PERSPECTIVE

02:50:38.995 --> 02:50:40.763
FROM THE OTHER THE OPPOSITION

02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:42.065
STAKEHOLDERS AND THEN.

02:50:42.131 --> 02:50:44.000
HI THIS IS A VERY ROBUST HEALTHY

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:44.968
CONVERSATION HERE SO I

02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:46.903
APPRECIATE IT -- BUT JUST IN

02:50:46.970 --> 02:50:55.945
TERMS OF PROCESS WISE IN RIGHT --

02:50:56.012 --> 02:50:57.347
SO UP.

02:50:57.413 --> 02:50:58.648
BIG PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH THE

02:50:58.715 --> 02:50:59.148
TRACKING TRACES.

02:50:59.215 --> 02:51:00.149
WE CAN IMAGINE THAT THE STATE OF

02:51:00.216 --> 02:51:00.817
LOUISIANA COULD POSSIBLY PUT IN

02:51:00.883 --> 02:51:01.818
A TRACK AND TRACE I DON'T KNOW

02:51:01.884 --> 02:51:02.385
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE I

02:51:02.452 --> 02:51:03.219
CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT COULD

02:51:03.286 --> 02:51:03.987
BE DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:05.388
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEXAS

02:51:05.455 --> 02:51:06.589
FLORIDA VIETNAM?

02:51:06.656 --> 02:51:08.625
BOB WAY PLACES ALL AROUND THE

02:51:08.691 --> 02:51:10.760
WORLD.

02:51:10.827 --> 02:51:12.562
ANY ANYTHING THAT THE FOLKS HERE

02:51:12.629 --> 02:51:14.430
COULD COME UP WITH WOULD NOT

02:51:14.497 --> 02:51:16.065
AFFECT THOSE PLACES THOSE

02:51:16.132 --> 02:51:18.234
PRODUCTS THOSE ANIMALS WILL BE

02:51:18.301 --> 02:51:19.402
COMING INTO THE CITY CALIFORNIA

02:51:19.469 --> 02:51:21.204
BEING SOLD.

02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:22.772
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THEY COULD

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:24.707
CRAFT THAT WOULD PULL THOSE

02:51:24.774 --> 02:51:25.908
COUNTRIES IN.

02:51:25.975 --> 02:51:27.010
YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

02:51:27.076 --> 02:51:28.611
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN

02:51:28.678 --> 02:51:29.278
UP THEIR SITE IS TO DO SOMETHING

02:51:29.345 --> 02:51:30.680
LIKE THAT.

02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:31.581
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN QUICKLY

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:31.881
[inaudible]

02:51:31.948 --> 02:51:35.785
AND JUST SO EVERYONE KNOWS.

02:51:35.852 --> 02:51:37.854
THIS IS FOR THE MEDICAL PORTION

02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:40.056
YOU CAN HAVE.

02:51:40.123 --> 02:51:41.057
A LIVE ANIMALS COME INTO THE

02:51:41.124 --> 02:51:43.026
STATE SO RESEARCH PLACES COULD

02:51:43.092 --> 02:51:45.628
HAVE LIVE TRUCKS COME IN AND

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:47.296
THEN THEY HANDLE THEM WITHIN THE

02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:48.531
RESEARCH LAB.

02:51:48.598 --> 02:51:50.500
WE KNOW THAT OUR CURRENT LAW

02:51:50.566 --> 02:51:52.335
YEAH UNDER CURRENT LAW UNDER THE

02:51:52.402 --> 02:51:55.138
IF THE BAND GO WENT INTO PLACE.

02:51:55.204 --> 02:51:57.006
WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT

02:51:57.073 --> 02:51:58.508
OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE

02:51:58.574 --> 02:52:00.576
READ ALOUD FOR RESEARCH BUT ARE

02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:01.978
NOT COMMERCIALLY SOLD.

02:52:02.045 --> 02:52:04.414
THAT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE IT WOULD

02:52:04.480 --> 02:52:06.949
BE AN ISSUE -- WILL TAKE ONE

02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:08.618
MORE COMMENT PERHAPS ADDRESS

02:52:08.685 --> 02:52:10.787
THAT LAST POINT SO -- EVEN IF WE

02:52:10.853 --> 02:52:12.155
WERE ABLE TO IMPORT LIVE

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:13.756
ALLIGATORS IN THE STATE IN ORDER

02:52:13.823 --> 02:52:14.757
TO CONDUCT RESEARCH THE

02:52:14.824 --> 02:52:16.192
AVAILABILITY THE SUPPLY OF THOSE

02:52:16.259 --> 02:52:17.560
ALLIGATORS WOULD BE THREATENED

02:52:17.627 --> 02:52:19.429
BECAUSE THE FUNDING FOR THE

02:52:19.495 --> 02:52:20.363
FARMS IN PARTICULAR IN THE

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:21.698
WETLANDS PRESERVATION WOULD BE

02:52:21.764 --> 02:52:22.832
DIMINISHED WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:52:22.899 --> 02:52:23.866
EARLIER SO.

02:52:23.933 --> 02:52:25.168
IF YOU INCREASE THE COST OF THE

02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:26.436
RAW MATERIAL YOU INCREASE THE

02:52:26.502 --> 02:52:28.071
COST OF THE RESEARCH WHICH MEANS

02:52:28.137 --> 02:52:29.305
THE RESEARCH WILL BE DONE.

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:30.840
BUT UNLIKE THE RESEARCH DONE IN

02:52:30.907 --> 02:52:32.975
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SINCE

02:52:33.042 --> 02:52:33.576
NINETEEN NINETY THAT RESEARCH

02:52:33.643 --> 02:52:34.977
WILL BE DONE IN NEVADA OR

02:52:35.044 --> 02:52:36.279
MINNESOTA OR YOU TO OR ANOTHER

02:52:36.345 --> 02:52:37.814
STATE YOU'RE SAYING A 25%

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:39.182
REDUCTION IN A BILLION DOLLAR

02:52:39.248 --> 02:52:40.983
INDUSTRY WILL DRIVE UP THE COST

02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:41.884
OF THOSE PARTS SUCH THAT IT

02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:42.185
WOULD BE.

02:52:42.251 --> 02:52:43.653
NOT COST EFFECTIVE DO THAT

02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:45.021
RESEARCH ANYMORE THE STATE OF

02:52:45.088 --> 02:52:46.355
CALIFORNIA.

02:52:46.422 --> 02:52:47.924
I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.891
THAT RESEARCH SHOULD BE

02:52:48.958 --> 02:52:49.492
CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE BUT THEN

02:52:49.559 --> 02:52:50.460
LET'S MAKE THIS WORK ON A

02:52:50.526 --> 02:52:52.862
MEDICAL RESEARCH EXEMPTION HERE

02:52:52.929 --> 02:52:54.063
AND THEN MAKE THAT THE CONDITION

02:52:54.130 --> 02:52:55.098
OF THE THE TWO AND A HALF YEAR

02:52:55.164 --> 02:52:56.499
THE ONE YEAR SOLELY FOR THOSE

02:52:56.566 --> 02:52:58.234
PURPOSES SO WE DON'T DO ANY HARM.

02:52:58.301 --> 02:53:01.170
BUT THEN DON'T AUTHORIZE THIS

02:53:01.237 --> 02:53:01.671
COMMERCIAL MARKET IN THE

02:53:01.738 --> 02:53:02.705
MEANTIME.

02:53:02.772 --> 02:53:03.806
BUT THAT EXEMPTION COULDN'T

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:05.341
PRICE SAID THE RAW MATERIALS THE

02:53:05.408 --> 02:53:07.110
NO NO YOU TO STUDY THAT ISSUE

02:53:07.176 --> 02:53:09.011
AND YOU SEE IF THERE'S SOME.

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:09.679
YEAH.

02:53:09.746 --> 02:53:11.447
WE COULD ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:12.348
THAT BUT RESEARCH FOLLOWS

02:53:12.415 --> 02:53:14.383
FUNDING AND THE FUNDING SOURCES

02:53:14.450 --> 02:53:15.918
WILL GO TO OTHER STATES BECAUSE

02:53:15.985 --> 02:53:16.786
THE COST OF THOSE MATERIALS CAN

02:53:16.853 --> 02:53:18.187
GET A CHEAPER SO THAT RESEARCH

02:53:18.254 --> 02:53:19.388
WILL BE CONDUCTED ELSEWHERE.

02:53:19.455 --> 02:53:20.957
IN IF WE DEVELOP THE CURE THEY

02:53:21.023 --> 02:53:21.891
WILL BE DEVELOPED IN OTHER

02:53:21.958 --> 02:53:24.327
STATES IRAQ'S THAT'S THE RISK

02:53:24.393 --> 02:53:25.728
YEAH I I THINK.

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:29.632
THERE'S YOU CAN ARGUE THAT RISK

02:53:29.699 --> 02:53:31.701
THE RISK OF FURTHER IN BOLD

02:53:31.768 --> 02:53:34.003
INNING IN INTERNATIONAL WILDLIFE

02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:35.238
TRACKING FEENEY.

02:53:35.304 --> 02:53:37.306
TRAFFICKING INDUSTRY FOR TWO

02:53:37.373 --> 02:53:38.141
YEARS.

02:53:38.207 --> 02:53:39.876
TELL ME FAR OUTWEIGHS THAT RISK

02:53:39.942 --> 02:53:40.743
AND I THINK WE CAN DEAL WITH

02:53:40.810 --> 02:53:42.945
THAT RISK HEAD ON RIGHT NOW IN

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:44.313
THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL IN

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:45.148
DOING.

02:53:45.214 --> 02:53:48.217
A CONDITIONAL EXTENSION ON JUST

02:53:48.284 --> 02:53:50.186
THE MEDICAL RESEARCH PIECE --

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:51.788
AND THEN LOOKING GIVING THE SHOT

02:53:51.854 --> 02:53:53.856
CLOCK ON GETTING TRACK ENTRY

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:55.291
SANCTION UP AND RUNNING AND THEN

02:53:55.358 --> 02:53:57.326
REVISITING THIS SPANISH IN THE

02:53:57.393 --> 02:53:58.728
FUTURE SO I AGAIN I I'M WILLING

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.096
TO SOLVE.

02:54:00.163 --> 02:54:02.598
THAT PROBLEM HERE I JUST DON'T

02:54:02.665 --> 02:54:03.466
KNOW.

02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:03.866
I DON'T.

02:54:03.933 --> 02:54:06.102
I CAN'T.

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:09.605
GO ON BLIND FAITH OR EVEN.

02:54:09.672 --> 02:54:11.374
ANY KIND OF FAITH RIGHT NOW IN

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.209
THE ZIMBABWEAN GOVERNMENT TO THE

02:54:13.276 --> 02:54:14.811
VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT'S

02:54:14.877 --> 02:54:17.046
COMPLIANCE WITH PUTTING RFID

02:54:17.113 --> 02:54:18.314
CHIPS IN.

02:54:18.381 --> 02:54:20.049
YOU KNOW THESE CRACKS ME AYE AYE

02:54:20.116 --> 02:54:20.616
EIGHT WE HAVE A TOUGH ENOUGH

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:22.051
TIME ENFORCING LABOR LAWS AND

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:23.786
ALL THE REST OF IT SO THAT'S

02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:24.387
WHERE I'M STRUGGLING.

02:54:24.453 --> 02:54:27.323
YEAH ARE YOU JUST MEASURE THE

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:28.291
WEEK.

02:54:28.357 --> 02:54:29.725
AGAIN I'M I'M GET LOST BECAUSE

02:54:29.792 --> 02:54:30.660
IF WE HAVE A TRACK INTEREST

02:54:30.726 --> 02:54:31.027
PROGRAM.

02:54:31.093 --> 02:54:32.862
AND IF WE REQUIRE FOR THE SALE

02:54:32.929 --> 02:54:35.031
OF PRODUCTS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF

02:54:35.097 --> 02:54:35.965
CALIFORNIA I KNOW SOME OF US

02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:37.834
LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE THIS TO

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:39.268
BE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT

02:54:39.335 --> 02:54:40.703
IN FACT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:44.040
WE JUST RUN CALIFORNIA BUT NONE

02:54:44.106 --> 02:54:45.775
THE LESS.

02:54:45.842 --> 02:54:48.544
WE COULD HAVE A PROGRAM THAT

02:54:48.611 --> 02:54:50.746
RESTRICTS SO CELLS OF ANY PLACE

02:54:50.813 --> 02:54:51.647
THAT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH THEIR

02:54:51.714 --> 02:54:52.682
TRACK AND TRACE PROGRAM IF THE

02:54:52.748 --> 02:54:53.950
TECHNOLOGY IN PLACE SORRY IT'S

02:54:54.016 --> 02:54:56.619
AN ABSURD READ HER ARGUMENT TO

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:57.253
SUGGEST WHILE THERE WAS NO WAY

02:54:57.320 --> 02:54:57.553
TO CONTROL.

02:54:57.620 --> 02:54:59.455
OUT THERE IN FACT IS.

02:54:59.522 --> 02:55:02.291
WHEN YOU START YOU KNOW WE ARE

02:55:02.358 --> 02:55:04.727
VERY EFFECTIVE IN DEALING?

02:55:04.794 --> 02:55:06.896
HAVE WHATEVER IN IT AND IT'S NOT

02:55:06.963 --> 02:55:07.730
A LOT IT'S NOT ALLOWED IN.

02:55:07.797 --> 02:55:09.398
HAS IT AND SO OF LOUISIANA CAN

02:55:09.465 --> 02:55:10.600
MEET THAT STANDARD OF FLORIDA

02:55:10.666 --> 02:55:11.734
CAN MEET THAT STANDARD -- GREAT

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:12.935
IF VIETNAM CAN'T WELL THEY'RE

02:55:13.002 --> 02:55:14.604
NOT SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS HERE

02:55:14.670 --> 02:55:16.639
RIGHT -- I'M NOT HERE TODAY

02:55:16.706 --> 02:55:19.108
CERTAINLY WORTH THAT I AM HERE

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:20.409
CONCERNED ABOUT THE WETLANDS IN

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:23.179
LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA AND THE

02:55:23.246 --> 02:55:23.980
IMPACT OUR MARKET HAS ON THOSE

02:55:24.046 --> 02:55:25.514
AND I'M CONCERNED THAT WE ARE UP

02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:27.149
AGAINST A DEADLINE I WISH WE

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:28.284
WERE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE A

02:55:28.351 --> 02:55:30.152
YEAR AGO BUT WE'RE HERE TODAY.

02:55:30.219 --> 02:55:34.957
AND WE NEED MORE TIME -- I THINK

02:55:35.024 --> 02:55:35.925
WE NEED A COUPLE YEARS.

02:55:35.992 --> 02:55:36.525
I OFFERED UP TO THE COMMITTEE

02:55:36.592 --> 02:55:37.526
PERHAPS WE CAN JUST DO A ONE

02:55:37.593 --> 02:55:38.694
YEAR EXTENSION TO AT LEAST GET

02:55:38.761 --> 02:55:40.229
US TO THE END OF THE SESSION SO

02:55:40.296 --> 02:55:41.664
THAT WE CAN WORK IN PARTNERSHIP

02:55:41.731 --> 02:55:42.465
WITH YOU.

02:55:42.531 --> 02:55:44.400
AND THE COMMITTEE TO PUT IN

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:48.004
PLACE HARD DEADLINES ON A TRACK

02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:49.705
AND TRACE AND ANY OTHER --

02:55:49.772 --> 02:55:52.341
REFINEMENTS OF CALIFORNIA LAW

02:55:52.408 --> 02:55:54.243
THAT WE THINK ARE APPLICABLE ARE

02:55:54.310 --> 02:55:56.412
NECESSARY. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

02:55:56.479 --> 02:55:58.881
ONLY DEALING IN A LEGAL PRODUCT

02:55:58.948 --> 02:56:00.549
WITH INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND

02:56:00.616 --> 02:56:02.385
TREATIES AND SO ON SO I WOULD

02:56:02.451 --> 02:56:04.387
ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN THE

02:56:04.453 --> 02:56:05.922
COMMITTEE MEMBERS HELP IN --

02:56:05.988 --> 02:56:07.089
DRAFTING OPPOSE THAT GIVES US AT

02:56:07.156 --> 02:56:08.624
LEAST THAT ONE YEAR IF NOT TWO

02:56:08.691 --> 02:56:10.159
YEAR PERIOD OF TIME TO

02:56:10.226 --> 02:56:11.694
ACCOMPLISH SO SIX AND SUCH A

02:56:11.761 --> 02:56:13.262
HARD DEADLINE ON TRACK ENTRIES

02:56:13.329 --> 02:56:14.830
WE DON'T HAVE THAT LONG NOW WE

02:56:14.897 --> 02:56:16.565
DON'T HAVE BY TWENTY TWENTY IF

02:56:16.632 --> 02:56:18.668
YOU DON'T HAVE A TRACKING TRICKS.

02:56:18.734 --> 02:56:19.335
LET'S PUT THAT IN WHAT WHAT WHAT

02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:20.202
LET'S YOUR SHOW SOME LEADERSHIP

02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:24.674
ON THAT ISSUE -- NOT JUST FOR

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:25.875
CALIFORNIA FOR THE COUNTRY.

02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:27.243
I THINK THAT'S A COMPELLING

02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:28.010
ARGUMENT.

02:56:28.077 --> 02:56:29.512
I WOULD SAY LET'S LET'S JUST DO

02:56:29.578 --> 02:56:32.014
THAT THEN IN THE BILL AND NOT

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:34.150
BUT NOT THE IN THE MEANTIME

02:56:34.216 --> 02:56:35.985
UNTIL WE HAVE IT.

02:56:36.052 --> 02:56:37.586
WE JUST START HOPE IT WORKS OUT

02:56:37.653 --> 02:56:38.354
I MEAN I THAT THAT'S THE THING

02:56:38.421 --> 02:56:39.221
IS.

02:56:39.288 --> 02:56:41.057
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GAP?

02:56:41.123 --> 02:56:42.291
WHAT WHAT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH

02:56:42.358 --> 02:56:43.693
THE GAPS OF THE ONES?

02:56:43.759 --> 02:56:46.295
YEAH SORRY BUT LOOK AT I WERE I

02:56:46.362 --> 02:56:47.196
DON'T WANT.

02:56:47.263 --> 02:56:49.131
TO YOU CERTAINLY DON'T IT CENTER

02:56:49.198 --> 02:56:50.266
COVER YOU'RE IN TROUBLE WITH

02:56:50.333 --> 02:56:50.666
CAUCUS.

02:56:50.733 --> 02:56:51.400
OTHER.

02:56:51.467 --> 02:56:52.134
BUT I'M THE ONE KEEPING THIS

02:56:52.201 --> 02:56:53.636
COMMITTEE GOT A FRIEND OVER

02:56:53.703 --> 02:56:54.837
THERE I THINK WE CAN WORK CAN

02:56:54.904 --> 02:56:57.106
YEAH YEAH I UNDERSTAND -- DID

02:56:57.173 --> 02:56:58.541
YOU A QUICK COMMENT CENTER GO

02:56:58.607 --> 02:57:00.209
HERE WELL I HEY I GUESS I WANTED

02:57:00.276 --> 02:57:01.610
TO BRING THIS TO COME TO A

02:57:01.677 --> 02:57:03.279
CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER

02:57:03.346 --> 02:57:04.547
AND I WHAT I HEAR.

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:08.417
WE HAVE THE STATUS QUO RIGHT NOW

02:57:08.484 --> 02:57:09.352
THE STATUS QUO IS WORKING.

02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:10.519
SO I SUGGEST WE TAKE THE OFFER

02:57:10.586 --> 02:57:11.954
THAT WAS MADE WHICH IS.

02:57:12.021 --> 02:57:13.889
TO AB IT EXTENDED FOR A YEAR OR

02:57:13.956 --> 02:57:14.857
TWO I THINK THE TRACK AND TRACE

02:57:14.924 --> 02:57:16.525
IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT'S THE

02:57:16.592 --> 02:57:18.060
DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO IN AND

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:19.195
QUITE FRANKLY IF WE'VE BEEN ABLE

02:57:19.261 --> 02:57:21.230
TO BE IF WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

02:57:21.297 --> 02:57:21.764
THIS.

02:57:21.831 --> 02:57:24.500
IN THE LEAFY GREEN.

02:57:24.567 --> 02:57:28.004
OUR AREA -- WE CERTAINLY.

02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:29.405
AND WE'RE DOING IT IN IN THE

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:31.173
MARIJUANA CONTEXT WE OUGHT TO BE

02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:33.476
ABLE TO DO IT WITH WITH -- LIVE

02:57:33.542 --> 02:57:35.077
ANIMALS AND SO I I JUST THINK WE

02:57:35.144 --> 02:57:36.946
CAN GET THERE I THINK WE NEED A

02:57:37.013 --> 02:57:38.047
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO DO IT.

02:57:38.114 --> 02:57:40.282
I'M PREPARED TO MOVE MOVE THAT

02:57:40.349 --> 02:57:44.086
WE MOVE THE BELT WITH THEY

02:57:44.153 --> 02:57:47.890
WONDER TO WHATEVER THE CHAIR --

02:57:47.957 --> 02:57:49.291
AB FED WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

02:57:49.358 --> 02:57:51.527
WITH THE EXTENSION SO THAT THE

02:57:51.594 --> 02:57:53.662
STATUS QUO CAN CONTINUE AND WITH

02:57:53.729 --> 02:57:55.731
THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE CREATE

02:57:55.798 --> 02:57:58.000
THIS TRACK AND TRACE.

02:57:58.067 --> 02:57:59.969
PROGRAM -- AND IT'D BE UP AND

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:01.570
RUNNING WITHIN IT WITH A DATE

02:58:01.637 --> 02:58:03.672
CERTAIN SO THAT WE GET WHAT WE

02:58:03.739 --> 02:58:08.644
REALLY WANT WHICH IS MY I THINK.

02:58:08.711 --> 02:58:09.845
WHAT THE THAT THE ANOMALY HERE

02:58:09.912 --> 02:58:11.514
IS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE STE AND AN

02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:12.415
ANIMAL OVER THERE THERE IS --

02:58:12.481 --> 02:58:14.116
STRONG FEELINGS AGAINST USING

02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:16.118
THEIR PRODUCTS BUT WE ALSO HAVE

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.920
THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO HELP

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:19.522
THE WETLANDS WHICH IS

02:58:19.588 --> 02:58:22.591
DESPERATELY IMPORTANT ON AIR AND

02:58:22.658 --> 02:58:23.726
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE

02:58:23.793 --> 02:58:25.061
FARMING CAN.

PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN OCTOBER

03:13:09.711 --> 03:13:11.680
EXPRESSLY EMPHASIZES THE

03:13:11.746 --> 03:13:13.381
CONTINUITY OF THE MISSION OF THE

03:13:13.448 --> 03:13:14.349
COMMISSION.

03:13:14.416 --> 03:13:16.051
AGAIN IT'S A CLEAN WATER ACT

03:13:16.117 --> 03:13:17.652
PROGRAM SO THERE'S NOT A

03:13:17.719 --> 03:13:19.054
MOVEMENT AWAY FROM CLEAN WATER

03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:20.622

COMMISSION.

03:13:26.995 --> 03:13:27.996

03:13:30.098 --> 03:13:31.466
IF THIS IF.

03:13:31.533 --> 03:13:33.134
IF THE WAY THAT THE COMMISSION

03:13:33.201 --> 03:13:34.970
HAS STARTED RUNNING IN THE LAST

03:13:35.036 --> 03:13:35.570
TWO YEARS OF THAT'S WHAT YOU

03:13:35.637 --> 03:13:36.471
WANT.

03:13:36.538 --> 03:13:37.739
THERE SHOULD BE A VERY PRECISE

03:13:37.806 --> 03:13:38.940
LEGISLATIVE BILL FOR LOTS OF THE

03:13:39.007 --> 03:13:41.076
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S GOING

03:13:41.142 --> 03:13:43.979
ON IF THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT.

03:13:44.045 --> 03:13:45.046
THEN WE WOULD ASK YOU.

03:13:45.113 --> 03:13:47.449
TO THINK ABOUT THIS BILL BECAUSE

03:13:47.515 --> 03:13:48.783
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS HAPPENING

03:13:48.850 --> 03:13:49.884
HERE IS THAT.

03:13:49.951 --> 03:13:51.319
THIS IS AN ATTEMPT.

03:13:51.386 --> 03:13:52.520
THAT WHEN THE PUBLIC TRIES TO

03:13:52.587 --> 03:13:54.456
ENFORCE STATE TRANSPARENCY LAWS

03:13:54.522 --> 03:13:56.224
AND PUBLIC INTEREST LAWS.

03:13:56.291 --> 03:13:58.059
THE ARGUMENT GOING TO BE THAT

03:13:58.126 --> 03:14:00.061
YOU FOLKS ENDORSED.

03:14:00.128 --> 03:14:01.763

03:14:06.401 --> 03:14:08.136

03:14:15.944 --> 03:14:17.145
FOUNDATION.

03:14:17.212 --> 03:14:18.413

03:14:18.480 --> 03:14:19.514
KNOCK ON THE FOUNDATION IT'S

03:14:19.581 --> 03:14:20.915

WITH A DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT'S

03:15:42.097 --> 03:15:45.733
OF CURRENTLY THE WATER RESOURCE

03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:46.701
QUALITY CONTROL BOARD FOR A

03:15:46.768 --> 03:15:49.471
PROVIDES ONE POINT TWO P. WHY --

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:51.806
TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSION -- THE

03:15:51.873 --> 03:15:54.142
SOME OF THE DESCRIPTION THAT

03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:55.743
MISTER LAMB JUST PROVIDED FOR US --

03:15:55.810 --> 03:15:57.912
THAT THE STATE STAFFING USED TO

03:15:57.979 --> 03:15:59.581
BE VERY -- THAT MUCH MORE

03:15:59.647 --> 03:16:01.082
ELEVATED THAN IT IS NOW THAT THE

03:16:01.149 --> 03:16:02.917
FOUNDATION SORT OF GOBBLED UP

03:16:02.984 --> 03:16:04.619
THOSE PEOPLE -- THE THERE WAS A

03:16:04.686 --> 03:16:06.321
TRADITION DURING THE

03:16:06.387 --> 03:16:08.256
200-082-0009 -- RECESSION AND

03:16:08.323 --> 03:16:09.557
THOSE.

03:16:09.624 --> 03:16:11.593
POSITIONS WERE NEVER REPLACED --

03:16:11.659 --> 03:16:12.660
ALL OF THE WORK THAT THE

LOCAL STATE FEDERAL BOMB HAS HAS

03:16:23.671 --> 03:16:25.740

WE'RE MAKING A SMART MOVE TO

03:16:27.308 --> 03:16:29.944
FIND A AGENCY IN THE STATE

03:16:30.011 --> 03:16:31.646
BECAUSE OF CONSERVANCY THAT IS

03:16:31.713 --> 03:16:33.114
EAGER TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM --

03:16:33.181 --> 03:16:34.582
I THINK THEY WILL WORK HARD TO

03:16:34.649 --> 03:16:36.151
FIND SOME MORE RESOURCES TO

03:16:36.217 --> 03:16:38.486
SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM AND I DON'T

03:16:38.553 --> 03:16:40.388
THINK THAT THERE'S REALLY. TOO

03:16:40.455 --> 03:16:43.124
MANY -- I I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND

03:16:43.191 --> 03:16:44.159
SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS I WOULD

03:16:44.225 --> 03:16:45.827

03:17:20.562 --> 03:17:21.529
ASPECTS.

03:17:21.596 --> 03:17:23.064
ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE

03:17:23.131 --> 03:17:25.733
EXPERTISE AND THE STRATEGIC PLAN

03:17:25.800 --> 03:17:27.202
OF THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY

03:17:27.268 --> 03:17:30.104

HAVE TO CONTEST THE IDEA THAT

03:17:48.523 --> 03:17:50.358
THIS IS FROM THE RECESSION FROM

03:17:50.425 --> 03:17:50.992
TWO THOUSAND THEY WERE TALKING

03:17:51.059 --> 03:17:51.893

03:18:15.183 --> 03:18:16.217

03:18:16.284 --> 03:18:17.619
A BIG CHUNK OF THOSE EMPLOYEES.

03:18:17.685 --> 03:18:19.320
CAME OFF THE STATE AGENCY

03:18:19.387 --> 03:18:21.055
WEBSITE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO

03:18:21.122 --> 03:18:22.056
HEADED OUT BUSINESS CARDS THEY

03:18:22.123 --> 03:18:22.523

03:18:22.590 --> 03:18:24.659
LETTERS ON STOP GOOD GOVERNMENT

03:18:24.726 --> 03:18:26.995
AGENCY STATIONARY.

03:18:27.061 --> 03:18:27.495
THEIR EMAILS ENDED WITH

03:18:27.562 --> 03:18:28.863
COMMISSION.

03:18:28.930 --> 03:18:29.731
THEY'RE GONE.

03:18:29.797 --> 03:18:32.567
AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

03:18:32.634 --> 03:18:34.502
HAVING EIGHTEEN POSITIONS

03:18:34.569 --> 03:18:35.903
COMMISSION POSITIONS.

03:18:35.970 --> 03:18:39.207
GOING DOWN TO POTENTIALLY ONE OR

03:18:39.274 --> 03:18:40.775
TWO I AGAIN THE COMMISSION

03:18:40.842 --> 03:18:42.443
HASN'T ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE IN

03:18:42.510 --> 03:18:43.177
THREE YEARS.

03:18:43.244 --> 03:18:44.579
I USED TO HAVE A COMMUNICATIONS

03:18:44.646 --> 03:18:46.247
DIRECTOR AND THEY WOULD ISSUE

03:18:46.314 --> 03:18:48.349
PRESS RELEASES.

03:18:48.416 --> 03:18:48.916
THEY HAVEN'T ISSUED A PRESS

03:18:48.983 --> 03:18:49.784
RELEASE IN THREE YEARS.

03:18:49.851 --> 03:18:51.853
IS A NUMBER THAT WE WE CARE

03:18:51.919 --> 03:18:53.221
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE.

03:18:53.288 --> 03:18:55.723
WHEN THE DRAFT A ARE CAME OUT?

03:18:55.790 --> 03:18:57.225
THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY PROJECT

03:18:57.292 --> 03:18:57.825
OF THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN FOR

03:18:57.892 --> 03:18:59.127
MANY YEARS.

03:18:59.193 --> 03:19:01.129
THE ONLY REASON THEY GAVE AS TO

03:19:01.195 --> 03:19:02.530
WHY THEY COULDN'T WAY IN.

03:19:02.597 --> 03:19:03.931
WHICH IS WHAT THE LEGISLATION

03:19:03.998 --> 03:19:05.400
MANDATES RIGHT MONITOR ASSESS

03:19:05.466 --> 03:19:06.934
COORDINATED BY THE ONLY REASON

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:08.436
THAT WAS GIVEN WAS THE LIMITED

03:19:08.503 --> 03:19:10.004
STAFF CAPACITY OF THE COMMISSION.

03:19:10.071 --> 03:19:11.339
SO WE HAVE A LEGITIMATE REASON

03:19:11.406 --> 03:19:13.141
TO CARE ABOUT THIS DROP AND

03:19:13.207 --> 03:19:13.975
STAFF.

03:19:14.042 --> 03:19:16.411
I WOULD SAY ONE QUICK QUESTION

03:19:16.477 --> 03:19:17.512
IF I COULD JUST PUT IT IN. FOR

03:19:17.578 --> 03:19:19.614
YOU DO SO SO THE SENATE THE

03:19:19.681 --> 03:19:22.583
ISSUE THE CONCERN FROM THE

03:19:22.650 --> 03:19:23.484
OPPOSITION IS ABOUT.

03:19:23.551 --> 03:19:24.952
THE LACK OF RESOURCES.

03:19:25.019 --> 03:19:27.455
GOING INTO STAFFING POSITIONS IN

03:19:27.522 --> 03:19:29.090
SORT OF LEAVING A SHELL OF THE

03:19:29.157 --> 03:19:30.525
COMMISSION.

03:19:30.591 --> 03:19:32.860
IS THIS BILL.

03:19:32.927 --> 03:19:35.263
ADDRESS RESOURCES IN ANY WAY OR

03:19:35.330 --> 03:19:36.631
IS THIS MORE ABOUT.

03:19:36.698 --> 03:19:38.800
GOVERNANCE AND REORGANIZATION IN

03:19:38.866 --> 03:19:41.502
YOUR MIND IS IT'S THE LATTER --

03:19:41.569 --> 03:19:43.404
THE REASON FOR THE CHANGE HERE

03:19:43.471 --> 03:19:46.374
IT IS -- BECAUSE THE

03:19:46.441 --> 03:19:48.509
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT -- CAN BE

03:19:48.576 --> 03:19:49.877
PROVIDED BY THE CONSERVANCY IS

03:19:49.944 --> 03:19:52.080
MORE IN LINE WITH THE GOALS AND

03:19:52.146 --> 03:19:53.414
THE MISSION OF THE CONSERVANCY

03:19:53.481 --> 03:19:55.717
THAN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES.

03:19:55.783 --> 03:20:00.021
CONTROL BOARD -- MISTER FORD CAN

03:20:00.088 --> 03:20:01.422
RESPOND.

03:20:01.489 --> 03:20:03.157
TO EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE HEARD

03:20:03.224 --> 03:20:04.325
OF BUT I THINK IT THAT YOU'VE

03:20:04.392 --> 03:20:05.560
HEARD BUT I I THINK IT'S

03:20:05.626 --> 03:20:07.328
IMPORTANT TO FOCUS IN ON THE

03:20:07.395 --> 03:20:08.930
FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY LIMITED

03:20:08.996 --> 03:20:09.997
CHANGE THAT'S BEING.

03:20:10.064 --> 03:20:17.271
MADE HERE -- AS FAR AS THE SOME

03:20:17.338 --> 03:20:19.440
OF THE ISSUES -- THAT HAVE BEEN

03:20:19.507 --> 03:20:23.811
RAISED I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU.

03:20:23.878 --> 03:20:25.546
THAT I ACTUALLY.

03:20:25.613 --> 03:20:27.014
CHAIRED THE COMMISSION.

03:20:27.081 --> 03:20:28.516
THROUGH THE PERIOD OF TIME

03:20:28.583 --> 03:20:30.518
THROUGH THE RECESSIONARY PERIOD

03:20:30.585 --> 03:20:32.153
OF TIME.

03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:34.055
WHEN THERE WAS A REDUCTION?

03:20:34.122 --> 03:20:36.858
IN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO

03:20:36.924 --> 03:20:38.559
THE COMMISSION BUT MORE

03:20:38.626 --> 03:20:40.928
IMPORTANTLY -- I WANT TO ASSURE

03:20:40.995 --> 03:20:42.230
YOU THAT THERE'S NOTHING

03:20:42.296 --> 03:20:45.299
NEFARIOUS GOING ON WITH THE

03:20:45.366 --> 03:20:48.770
FOUNDATION. FOR THE COMMISSION.

03:20:48.836 --> 03:20:52.573
THIS IS A ORGANIZATION THAT DOES

03:20:52.640 --> 03:20:53.841
ALL OF ITS BUSINESS.

03:20:53.908 --> 03:20:56.210
IN PUBLIC.

03:20:56.277 --> 03:20:58.279
IS THERE OPPOSITION TO SOME OF

03:20:58.346 --> 03:21:00.314
THE THINGS THAT THE COMMISSION

03:21:00.381 --> 03:21:03.151
HAS DONE OVER THE YEARS -- AN

03:21:03.217 --> 03:21:05.052
EXAMPLE BEING THE MALIBU LAGOON

03:21:05.119 --> 03:21:06.454
PROJECT THAT YOU'RE VERY

03:21:06.521 --> 03:21:09.457
FAMILIAR WITH YES IN FACT THERE

03:21:09.524 --> 03:21:11.125
HAS BEEN OPPOSITION TO IT.

03:21:11.192 --> 03:21:12.560
NOT UNLIKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S

03:21:12.627 --> 03:21:14.295
OPPOSITION TO VIRTUALLY ANYTHING

03:21:14.362 --> 03:21:15.797
THAT'S PROPOSED AND THAT'S

03:21:15.863 --> 03:21:16.764
HEALTHY.

03:21:16.831 --> 03:21:19.100
OF OF FOR EVERYONE WHEN WE

03:21:19.167 --> 03:21:21.035
ENGAGE IN THAT KIND OF DIALOGUE.

03:21:21.102 --> 03:21:23.571
BUT I THINK WITH REPECT TO THE

03:21:23.638 --> 03:21:25.039
SPECIFICS.

03:21:25.106 --> 03:21:26.741
OF THIS REPORT IS PROBABLY BEST

03:21:26.808 --> 03:21:29.477
POSITION TO DO THAT YEAH I JUST

03:21:29.544 --> 03:21:31.379
ONE TRY JUST ONE THING -- AND

03:21:31.446 --> 03:21:34.849
AND MISTER LAMB SHOULD KNOW THIS --

03:21:34.916 --> 03:21:36.217

03:21:36.284 --> 03:21:36.884
COURT AND LITIGATED -- QUESTIONS

03:21:36.951 --> 03:21:38.052
ABOUT WHERE THE COMMISSION

03:21:38.119 --> 03:21:39.253
STARTED AND STOPPED WHERE THE

03:21:39.320 --> 03:21:41.689
FOUNDATION STARTED AND STOPPED.

03:21:41.756 --> 03:21:43.858
AND PRIOR TO MY ROLES AND

03:21:43.925 --> 03:21:46.160
RESPONSIBILITIES.

03:21:46.227 --> 03:21:47.762
OF RUNNING THE ORGANIZATION.

03:21:47.829 --> 03:21:49.130
THERE WAS A CONFLATION OF THE

03:21:49.197 --> 03:21:50.531
COMMISSION.

03:21:50.598 --> 03:21:51.032
EVERYBODY WORKED FOR THE

03:21:51.098 --> 03:21:53.034
COMMISSION TOM I THINK IT WAS

03:21:53.100 --> 03:21:54.869
DONE LARGELY INNOCENTLY BUT

03:21:54.936 --> 03:21:56.604
FAIRLY ENOUGH THE COURT SAID HEY.

03:21:56.671 --> 03:21:57.271
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE

03:21:57.338 --> 03:21:58.139
COMMISSION IS AND WHERE THE

03:21:58.206 --> 03:22:00.274
FOUNDATION IS AND YOU GUYS NEED

03:22:00.341 --> 03:22:01.776
TO CLARIFY THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

03:22:01.843 --> 03:22:03.211
YOU DON'T NEED TO JUST TALK THAT

03:22:03.277 --> 03:22:04.045
TALK ME TO WALK THAT WALK AS

03:22:04.111 --> 03:22:05.480
WELL SO WE'VE MADE ALL THOSE

03:22:05.546 --> 03:22:06.447
STEPS.

03:22:06.514 --> 03:22:08.015
TOM AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE

03:22:08.082 --> 03:22:09.650
TODAY -- SO IF WE SHINE THE

03:22:09.717 --> 03:22:10.918
LIGHT INTO PLACE WHERE IT WAS

03:22:10.985 --> 03:22:12.653
MURKY BEFORE I DON'T WANT TO

03:22:12.720 --> 03:22:15.022
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- AND IF

03:22:15.089 --> 03:22:16.390
ANYTHING YES WE ARE TRYING TO

03:22:16.457 --> 03:22:17.959
MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE ASSETS

03:22:18.025 --> 03:22:20.161
THAT WE CAN ACQUIRE AND ASSEMBLE

03:22:20.228 --> 03:22:20.828
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACHIEVE OUR

03:22:20.895 --> 03:22:22.263
MISSION.

03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:22.930

03:22:22.997 --> 03:22:23.831
DO.

03:22:23.898 --> 03:22:25.032
AND I THINK AB FIFTEEN ELEVEN IT

03:22:25.099 --> 03:22:26.567
IS A STEP IN THAT RIGHT

03:22:26.634 --> 03:22:28.202
DIRECTION THAT HELPS BRING MORE

A LONG HISTORY AND I KNOW

THERE'S A LOT OF CONTENTIOUSNESS

03:22:35.109 --> 03:22:37.245
ABOUT PROJECTS AND DEVELOPMENTS

03:22:37.311 --> 03:22:38.813
AND I'M VERY SENSITIVE.

03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:39.881
SOME OF THE ISSUES GOING ON A BY

03:22:39.947 --> 03:22:41.215

03:22:41.282 --> 03:22:42.116

LAGOON.

03:22:44.852 --> 03:22:46.153
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO

CONCERN WHICH I THINK IS

03:23:00.768 --> 03:23:02.870
LEGITIMATE AND BUT IT SOUNDS

CALIFORNIA'S WILD CATS ARE MUCH

THEY'RE NOT.

03:56:45.124 --> 03:56:48.127
EATING THEM AND SO THE QUESTION

03:56:48.193 --> 03:56:49.028
IS.

03:56:49.094 --> 03:56:50.062
YOU KNOW MORALLY THERE'S A

03:56:50.129 --> 03:56:50.829
QUESTION ABOUT WHY -- THEY WOULD

03:56:50.896 --> 03:56:52.698
NEED TO BE -- SHOT THE OTHER

03:56:52.765 --> 03:56:53.999
ISSUE IS I KNOW PEOPLE ARE

03:56:54.066 --> 03:56:55.367
SUGGESTING THAT THE SETS A BAD

03:56:55.434 --> 03:56:57.102
PRECEDENT BUT I'M TO MY

03:56:57.169 --> 03:56:58.671
KNOWLEDGE IN THE LAST THIRTY

03:56:58.737 --> 03:57:00.372
YEARS THE ONLY HUNTING BAN --

03:57:00.439 --> 03:57:01.340
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN

03:57:01.407 --> 03:57:02.575
ACTED AS BEEN A BAN ON MOUNTAIN

03:57:02.641 --> 03:57:04.343
LION SO I DO THINK YOU KNOW

03:57:04.410 --> 03:57:06.011
WHERE THIRTY YEAR TIME SPAN DOES

03:57:06.078 --> 03:57:07.212
SUGGEST THAT WERE BEING

03:57:07.279 --> 03:57:08.814
INCREDIBLY JUDICIOUS.

03:57:08.881 --> 03:57:09.915
ABOUT THE BANDS THAT WERE

03:57:09.982 --> 03:57:13.218
PLACING WE DO AGREE -- THAT THE

03:57:13.285 --> 03:57:15.588
COMMISSION SHOULD BE HIGHLY

03:57:15.654 --> 03:57:17.323
INVOLVED IN FACT -- IN IT WAS IN

03:57:17.389 --> 03:57:19.258
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

03:57:19.325 --> 03:57:23.495
COMMISSION -- STAFF THAT WE

03:57:23.562 --> 03:57:25.230
SUPPORTED I MAINTENANCE ON THE

03:57:25.297 --> 03:57:27.066
ASSEMBLY SIDE AS IT RELATES TO

03:57:27.132 --> 03:57:29.335
THE MANAGEMENT PLAN -- THEY IT

03:57:29.401 --> 03:57:33.539
IS REALLY SORT OF UP -- TO THE

03:57:33.606 --> 03:57:34.206
COMMISSION TO DECIDE.

03:57:34.273 --> 03:57:35.274
HOW QUICKLY THEY WANT TO DO

03:57:35.341 --> 03:57:36.775
THEIR STUDY IN THE QUICKER THEY

03:57:36.842 --> 03:57:38.277
DO THE STUDY THE QUICKER THE BAN

03:57:38.344 --> 03:57:40.613
IS LIFTED -- BUT THIS CERTAINLY

03:57:40.679 --> 03:57:42.715
DOES SORT OF PUT A PAUSE ON

03:57:42.781 --> 03:57:45.618
THOSE KINDS OF KILLINGS OF OF

03:57:45.684 --> 03:57:48.053
BOBCATS AND AND WILD CATS WE

03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:48.821
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

03:57:48.887 --> 03:57:51.390
WAIT. FOR A SPECIES TO BE ON THE

03:57:51.457 --> 03:57:52.725
BRINK OF EXTINCTION BEFORE WE

03:57:52.791 --> 03:57:54.660
HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHETHER

03:57:54.727 --> 03:57:56.562
OR NOT WE SHOULD BE PROTECTING

03:57:56.629 --> 03:57:59.765
THEM -- AND THAT ISSUE BEFORE

03:57:59.832 --> 03:58:01.033
INTERRUPT YOU.

03:58:01.100 --> 03:58:03.235

CREDIBLE SCIENCE AND WE ACCEPT.

03:58:08.941 --> 03:58:10.376
OKAY SO SO THAT IS IN THERE AND

03:58:10.442 --> 03:58:11.644
HOPEFULLY THAT DOES PROVIDE A

03:58:11.710 --> 03:58:13.145
LITTLE MORE CERTAINTY TO THE

03:58:13.212 --> 03:58:14.813
IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE BEING

03:58:14.880 --> 03:58:16.081

UCLA AND A RESEARCHER FROM USC.

04:42:42.045 --> 04:42:43.079
SO THAT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU HAVE

04:42:43.146 --> 04:42:45.014
AN INCREASE IN AIRBNB RENTALS

04:42:45.081 --> 04:42:47.116

DEMOLISHED AND NOT REPLACE?

04:43:17.213 --> 04:43:17.980
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

04:43:18.047 --> 04:43:19.182
INFORMATIONAL SURVEY OF AIRBNB

04:43:19.248 --> 04:43:20.383

AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE WAS A

04:45:10.660 --> 04:45:11.327
MINUTE ASSEMBLY NATURAL

JURISDICTIONS.

04:45:15.498 --> 04:45:16.833
AND THIS MEANS THERE'S A LOT OF

04:45:16.899 --> 04:45:18.401
THE OPT OUT PROVISION WOULD BE

04:45:18.468 --> 04:45:19.702
BUT THERE'S A RESIDENTIAL

04:45:19.769 --> 04:45:22.238

JURISDICTIONS.

04:45:36.352 --> 04:45:37.987
THIS IS CRITICAL TO ALLOW CITIES

04:45:38.054 --> 04:45:39.889
TO OPERATE THE EMERGENCY IN

04:45:39.956 --> 04:45:41.224

WHICH ARE MANY HOTELS AND HOW

THE IMPACT THE COMMUNITIES THIS

04:45:45.862 --> 04:45:47.396
ALSO ALLOWS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

ONE OF THE THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG

04:45:53.669 --> 04:45:55.071
ISSUES THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

04:45:55.137 --> 04:45:55.972
HAVE.

04:45:56.038 --> 04:45:56.506
WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THE

04:45:56.572 --> 04:45:58.875
AFFORDABLE ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL

04:45:58.941 --> 04:45:59.442

ORDINANCES.

04:46:00.510 --> 04:46:01.310
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE

04:46:04.046 --> 04:46:05.081
THREE YEAR PILOT.

04:46:05.147 --> 04:46:06.349
IT WILL GET A MUCH NEEDED STUDY

04:46:06.415 --> 04:46:07.316
ON THE IMPACT OF SHORT TERM

04:46:07.383 --> 04:46:09.018
VACATION RENTAL PLATFORMS ON THE

HOUSING MARKET IN SAN DIEGO

04:46:10.987 --> 04:46:11.687
COUNTY SCHOOL SYSTEM.

SPECIFICALLY I'M INTERESTED IN

04:46:13.556 --> 04:46:18.361
THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM RENTAL

04:46:18.427 --> 04:46:20.296
RATES AND HOUSING AVAILABILITY.

04:46:20.363 --> 04:46:21.330
TO IMPLEMENT IT REQUIRES

04:46:21.397 --> 04:46:22.798
PLATFORMS TO ADD FOR CHECK BOXES

04:46:22.865 --> 04:46:24.200

HAVE THE PERMISSION FOR THE

04:46:32.441 --> 04:46:33.743
LANDLORDS FOR THE SHORT TERM

04:46:33.809 --> 04:46:34.944
VACATION RENTALS.

04:46:35.011 --> 04:46:36.179
CITIES WILL SEE THIS RECEIVE

04:46:36.245 --> 04:46:37.780

04:46:41.384 --> 04:46:42.919
AB SEVENTY THIRTY ONE PROTECTS

04:46:42.985 --> 04:46:43.819
PROPERTY RIGHTS BUT NOT

04:46:43.886 --> 04:46:45.388
REGULARLY PROPERTY OWNERS THEY

LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT HAS TO DO

05:00:32.981 --> 05:00:34.883
THAT REQUIRES A REZONING OF

SORTS.

05:00:36.017 --> 05:00:37.586

THERE LET ME HEAR FROM

05:00:47.262 --> 05:00:48.430
OPPOSITION IN SUPPORT.

05:00:48.497 --> 05:00:49.264
ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU DID I

MEAN I KNOW THESE BROADER ISSUES

05:00:50.232 --> 05:00:51.199
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION

05:00:51.266 --> 05:00:52.367
BUT BUT THE ONE OF THE CRITICAL

05:00:52.434 --> 05:00:53.402
COMMENT THAT FOR ME IT WAS MADE

05:00:53.468 --> 05:00:54.903
BY. ONE OF THE WITNESSES JUST

05:00:54.970 --> 05:00:57.773
NOW AND IT WAS ALSO MADE.

05:00:57.839 --> 05:00:58.673
IN A I'M.

05:00:58.740 --> 05:01:01.309
YOU KNOW IN A IN A PREVIOUS

05:01:01.376 --> 05:01:03.412
CONVERSATIONS HAVING OPPOSITION.

05:01:03.478 --> 05:01:05.080
IS THAT THIS BEST TO RESOLVE THE

05:01:05.147 --> 05:01:06.181
LOCAL LEVEL AND TO THE EXTENT OF

05:01:06.248 --> 05:01:09.484
THIS BILL ALLOWS A COMMUNITY. TO

05:01:09.551 --> 05:01:11.019
DO THE REZONING WHICH WOULD

05:01:11.086 --> 05:01:12.521
ALLOW FOR THE PLATFORMS TO

05:01:12.587 --> 05:01:14.256
CONTINUE OPERATING IF THAT'S

05:01:14.322 --> 05:01:15.891
WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS.

05:01:15.957 --> 05:01:16.958
THAT MAKES ME FEEL MORE

05:01:17.025 --> 05:01:18.527
COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE BILL

05:01:18.593 --> 05:01:19.327
IN THE AND YOU KNOW IF IF SO

05:01:19.394 --> 05:01:20.929
FOLKS HAVE RESPONSES THAT

05:01:20.996 --> 05:01:23.732
REACTIONS I'D LOVE TO HEAR.

05:01:23.799 --> 05:01:24.366
I'VE GOT SOMETHING WRONG IF I'M

05:01:24.433 --> 05:01:25.734
MISTAKEN.

05:01:25.801 --> 05:01:27.102
SURE SO OUR BELL WE EXPLICITLY

05:01:27.169 --> 05:01:28.236
ALLOW THE OPT OUT MECHANISM FOR

05:01:28.303 --> 05:01:29.704
THE RESIDENTIAL TOURISM.

05:01:29.771 --> 05:01:30.806
I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN IN

05:01:30.872 --> 05:01:32.374
MAKING SURE TO STATE LAWS DON'T

05:01:32.441 --> 05:01:33.408
CONFLICT WITH EACH OTHER AND

05:01:33.475 --> 05:01:34.943
CAUSE PROBLEMS AT THE LOCAL

05:01:35.010 --> 05:01:35.143
LEVEL.

05:01:35.210 --> 05:01:37.279
MORE HAPPY TO TAKE. ONE OF THE

05:01:37.345 --> 05:01:38.680
REASONS WE DIDN'T WANT TO OPT

05:01:38.747 --> 05:01:40.615
OUT MECHANISM TO BE A REZONING

05:01:40.682 --> 05:01:42.217
PROCESS IS BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS

05:01:42.284 --> 05:01:43.752
THE PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THE

05:01:43.819 --> 05:01:44.853
PUBLIC TO WEIGH IN.

05:01:44.920 --> 05:01:46.254
PERSON OTHER MECHANISMS I THINK

05:01:46.321 --> 05:01:47.956
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR SELF

05:01:48.023 --> 05:01:50.692
DETERMINATION LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

05:01:50.759 --> 05:01:51.560
I LOOK TO HEAR FROM A POSITION

05:01:51.626 --> 05:01:53.428
OF THAT YEAH I THINK -- OUR OUR

05:01:53.495 --> 05:01:54.896
CONCERN WOULD STILL BE THAT --

05:01:54.963 --> 05:01:56.865
TO SOME DEGREE THE BILL AS IT'S

05:01:56.932 --> 05:01:58.467
DESIGNED EVEN WITH SORT OF A

05:01:58.533 --> 05:02:00.101
CHANGE IN THAT WAY IT'S STILL

05:02:00.168 --> 05:02:01.570
SORT OF CIRCUMVENTING.

05:02:01.636 --> 05:02:03.438
THE COASTAL COMMISSIONS PROCESS

05:02:03.505 --> 05:02:04.873
AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN CITIES UP

05:02:04.940 --> 05:02:07.075
AND DOWN THE COAST -- WHO HAVE

05:02:07.142 --> 05:02:09.411
WHO HAVE MORE RESTRICTIVE --

05:02:09.478 --> 05:02:11.746
POLICIES IN PLACE MORE FLEXIBLE

05:02:11.813 --> 05:02:13.215
POLICIES IN PLACE AND THERE IS A

05:02:13.281 --> 05:02:14.616
PROCESS THAT ALREADY EXISTS

05:02:14.683 --> 05:02:15.717
WHERE.

05:02:15.784 --> 05:02:17.452
RESIDENTS CAN WEIGH IN -- IN

05:02:17.519 --> 05:02:18.520
THOSE LOCAL ORDINANCES AND THE

05:02:18.587 --> 05:02:20.355
COASTAL COMMISSION CAN SORT OF

05:02:20.422 --> 05:02:22.624
BALANCE THE ACCESS AS WELL AS

05:02:22.691 --> 05:02:24.259
THE CONCERNS FROM THE COMMUNITY.

05:02:24.326 --> 05:02:25.660
AND SO WE'D STILL BE CONCERNED

05:02:25.727 --> 05:02:27.996
THAT THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY

05:02:28.063 --> 05:02:29.731
BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS

05:02:29.798 --> 05:02:30.932
CAN HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

05:02:30.999 --> 05:02:31.967
WHETHER IT IS.

05:02:32.033 --> 05:02:33.068
A CITY THAT ONCE MORE

05:02:33.134 --> 05:02:38.306
RESTRICTIVE POLICIES IN PLACE OR

05:02:38.373 --> 05:02:40.275
MORE.

05:02:40.342 --> 05:02:41.843
FLEXIBLE POLICIES IN PLACE THAN

05:02:41.910 --> 05:02:43.512
WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BILL

05:02:43.578 --> 05:02:45.046
JUSTICES OF TO PARLAY AFTER THAT

05:02:45.113 --> 05:02:46.014
I MEAN THE ISSUE IS THE ISSUE

05:02:46.081 --> 05:02:47.582
THAT THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS

05:02:47.649 --> 05:02:48.617
BANNED.

05:02:48.683 --> 05:02:49.217
KIND OF STEPPING IN ON THE

05:02:49.284 --> 05:02:51.286
ABILITY OF CITIES.

05:02:51.353 --> 05:02:52.087
TO SET THEIR OWN RULES YES SO

05:02:52.153 --> 05:02:53.221
THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DOES

05:02:53.288 --> 05:02:55.457
NOT HAVE ACCESS -- DOES NOT HAVE

05:02:55.524 --> 05:02:57.392
AUTHORITY THE BALANCE HOUSING

05:02:57.459 --> 05:02:58.760
AFFORDABILITY WITH COASTAL

05:02:58.827 --> 05:03:00.262
ACCESS THAT'S NO LONGER THE HOW

05:03:00.328 --> 05:03:02.130
CLOSE LET THAT WAS REMOVED AND

05:03:02.197 --> 05:03:03.932
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES SOMEONE A

05:03:03.999 --> 05:03:04.799
COASTAL COMMISSION LOOKS AT AN

05:03:04.866 --> 05:03:05.267
ORDINANCE.

05:03:05.333 --> 05:03:06.635
I CAN ONLY MAKE A DECISION ON

05:03:06.701 --> 05:03:09.404
COASTAL ACCESS AND JUST FOR A

05:03:09.471 --> 05:03:10.805
POINT IN THE CASE OUR CASE IN

05:03:10.872 --> 05:03:11.806
POINT THE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION

05:03:11.873 --> 05:03:12.874
HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE

05:03:12.941 --> 05:03:14.476
BILL AND I GUARANTEE YOU OF

05:03:14.543 --> 05:03:15.810
ANYBODY ON THE COAST COMMISSION

05:03:15.877 --> 05:03:17.345

05:03:17.412 --> 05:03:18.947
THIS BILL AFFECTING COASTAL

05:03:19.014 --> 05:03:21.049

COMMISSION WOULD BE.

05:03:26.555 --> 05:03:27.923
I WAS VERY PROTECTIVE OF THAT

05:03:27.989 --> 05:03:32.360
WHAT NOW LET ME ASK ANOTHER

05:03:32.427 --> 05:03:34.229
QUESTION AND MAYBE IT.

05:03:34.296 --> 05:03:36.464
IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHEN

05:03:36.531 --> 05:03:37.399
I WAS ASKING.

IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE MY CITY

05:05:58.506 --> 05:05:59.107
IN SIN IS THE AVERAGE HOME PRICE

WAS THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE

05:06:01.309 --> 05:06:01.643
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

05:06:01.710 --> 05:06:05.313
THAT PRICE IS ONE POINT TWO

IS ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

05:06:12.187 --> 05:06:13.988
BUT IF WE CAN'T STOP THE

05:06:14.055 --> 05:06:15.623
BLEEDING OUT THE BACK END.

05:06:15.690 --> 05:06:17.625
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY BILL MORE IN

05:06:17.692 --> 05:06:18.593
THE COASTAL ZONE THEY'RE JUST

05:06:18.660 --> 05:06:20.095

CAN YOU GIVE ME A A BETTER SENSE

05:06:34.142 --> 05:06:37.245
OF WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY.

05:06:37.312 --> 05:06:38.279
RESIDENTIAL TERRORISM LIKE WHAT

05:06:38.346 --> 05:06:39.481
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS ARE I

05:06:39.547 --> 05:06:42.650
NEVER SEVEN A CITY COUNCIL OKAY --

ALLOWED UNDER LAW.

05:06:47.055 --> 05:06:48.022
SO SO IT CAME ABOUT ACTUALLY

05:06:48.089 --> 05:06:49.524
VERY ORGANICALLY THE EYES WAS

05:06:49.591 --> 05:06:50.091

IT'S MEANT FOR SHORT TERM

05:07:00.835 --> 05:07:02.437

WORKING ON A DEFINITION OF THAT

THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST

05:07:25.193 --> 05:07:27.862
SO IT'S VERY CLEAR -- WHEN IN

TENSION BECAUSE COASTAL

FAMILIES AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND

05:10:01.516 --> 05:10:02.150
ALL THIS STUFF.

05:10:02.216 --> 05:10:03.551
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE WITH YOUR

UNDERSERVED PEOPLE LESS PEOPLE

05:10:07.855 --> 05:10:08.589
LESS WELL TO BE ABLE TO GET

05:10:08.656 --> 05:10:10.291
ACCESS PURSES THE ABILITY OF

05:10:10.358 --> 05:10:12.527
LOCALS? TO DEAL WITH ESPECIALLY

05:10:12.593 --> 05:10:14.629
WITH HOUSING IT HAS TO DO WITH.

05:10:14.696 --> 05:10:15.363
BEING A YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN SO

05:10:15.430 --> 05:10:16.130
MANY COMMITTEES IN THIS

COMMITTEE OVER SO MANY YEARS WE

05:10:17.932 --> 05:10:18.700
DEAL WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF

05:10:18.766 --> 05:10:20.835
ACCESS AND PEOPLE HAVING ACCESS

05:10:20.902 --> 05:10:21.202
TO THESE.

05:10:21.269 --> 05:10:22.904
EXTRAORDINARY CALIFORNIA

05:10:22.971 --> 05:10:25.473
RESOURCES AND ONE OF THE A BATES

05:10:25.540 --> 05:10:26.641
AGAIN IS THE COASTAL COMMISSION

05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:28.443
HAS CONSISTENTLY SAID THAT HOW

05:10:28.509 --> 05:10:29.544
DOES WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE

05:10:29.610 --> 05:10:31.346
RECONCILE WITH THAT VERY

05:10:31.412 --> 05:10:32.780
IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY.

05:10:32.847 --> 05:10:34.215
I THINK THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

05:10:34.282 --> 05:10:35.483
PART OF POLICY BUT WHEN YOU GO

05:10:35.550 --> 05:10:37.352
BACK YOU LOOK AND SAY LOW COST

05:10:37.418 --> 05:10:39.087
BECAUSE ACCOMODATIONS HOTEL

05:10:39.153 --> 05:10:41.656
MOTELS HOSTELS AND CAMPSITES.

05:10:41.723 --> 05:10:43.391
OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF

05:10:43.458 --> 05:10:45.526
CALIFORNIA THEN HE'LL COUNTIES

05:10:45.593 --> 05:10:46.961
CAUSES ON PROVIDES ONE THIRD OF

05:10:47.028 --> 05:10:50.198
THAT WE DO A GREAT JOB AND THERE

05:10:52.433 --> 05:10:52.633
FOR THAT.

05:10:52.700 --> 05:10:54.369
SO I THINK WHAT'S REALLY

05:10:54.435 --> 05:10:56.237
IMPORTANT IS THAT.

05:10:56.304 --> 05:10:57.405
I'M SORRY -- WHAT'S REALLY

05:10:57.472 --> 05:10:59.107

VACATION RENTAL IT'S ABOUT

05:11:17.725 --> 05:11:18.292

SUCH AN APPROVAL. FOR THAT IS

05:12:12.680 --> 05:12:14.115

ACTUALLY LIMITING COASTAL ACCESS

05:12:31.966 --> 05:12:33.468
THEY WOULD NOT BE NEUTRAL FIRST

05:12:33.534 --> 05:12:35.369
OF ALL I THINK -- THE OPPOSITION

05:12:35.436 --> 05:12:37.238

AN ENTIRE SUMMER THAT'S ALMOST

05:12:58.259 --> 05:12:59.694
EVERY WEEKEND OF THE YEAR THAT

05:13:47.642 --> 05:13:49.010
PEOPLE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT

05:13:49.076 --> 05:13:50.745
BE AVAILABLE AS RENTALS IN SOME

05:13:50.811 --> 05:13:51.045
WAY.

05:13:51.112 --> 05:13:52.613
IF IN FACT IT'S COST SO MUCH

05:13:52.680 --> 05:13:54.315
MONEY TO RENT THEM AIRBNB OR

05:13:54.382 --> 05:13:55.750
WHATEVER THE OTHER COMPANIES ARE.

05:13:55.816 --> 05:13:57.485
THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU REALLY

05:13:57.552 --> 05:13:59.086
AND HOW MANY SUCH UNITS ARE

05:13:59.153 --> 05:14:00.087
THERE AND WHAT IS THE NATURE OF

05:14:00.154 --> 05:14:00.521
THE PROBLEM.

05:14:00.588 --> 05:14:02.256
AND AND YOU KNOW WE WE WE ALL

05:14:02.323 --> 05:14:04.325
TALK ABOUT HOUSING IN AND OUT WE

05:14:04.392 --> 05:14:05.960
SEE ALL THESE PROPOSALS.

05:14:06.027 --> 05:14:06.861
WHAT DO YOU REALLY AFFECTING

05:14:06.928 --> 05:14:08.029
WHAT HOW MANY HUMAN BEINGS HOW

05:14:08.095 --> 05:14:09.430
MANY LIVES ARE BEING AFFECTED

05:14:09.497 --> 05:14:10.932
THE COUNTY YOU'RE TRYING TO DO

05:14:10.998 --> 05:14:12.200
THAT'S WHAT I ASKED YOU ABOUT I

05:14:12.266 --> 05:14:13.568
HAD SOME NUMBERS ON IT?

05:14:13.634 --> 05:14:14.268
BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR

05:14:14.335 --> 05:14:16.504
RESPONSE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ONE

05:14:16.571 --> 05:14:19.240
THING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE FACTS

05:14:19.307 --> 05:14:20.041
SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES DESERVE

05:14:20.107 --> 05:14:22.009
MATIC PROBLEM GIVE SO MUCH LAND

05:14:22.076 --> 05:14:23.844
SO MANY UNITS SO MUCH NUMBERS.

05:14:23.911 --> 05:14:24.845
WHAT'S THE IMPACT YOU NEED TO IT

05:14:24.912 --> 05:14:26.781
SEEMS TO ME YOU NEED TO MAKE

05:14:26.847 --> 05:14:28.382
THAT COMPELLING CASE THAT SHOWS

05:14:28.449 --> 05:14:30.818
THAT YOUR POLICY RESULTS IN

05:14:30.885 --> 05:14:38.793
BETTER ISSUES ON HOUSING.

05:14:38.859 --> 05:14:40.261
GO AHEAD I'LL RESPOND AFTERWARDS

05:14:40.328 --> 05:14:42.597
BUT HOUSE MEMBER MARK WEST

05:14:42.663 --> 05:14:43.364
FELONY REALLY I WANT TO FRAME

05:14:43.431 --> 05:14:44.265
THIS IN AN ARGUMENT FROM MY OWN

05:14:44.332 --> 05:14:45.566
CITY BECAUSE IMPERIAL BEACHES

05:14:45.633 --> 05:14:48.336
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LEAST OF LAW

05:14:48.402 --> 05:14:49.170
COMMUNITY AND ALL SENIOR COUNTY.

05:14:49.237 --> 05:14:50.538
AND WHEN AIRBNB THERE ARE

05:14:50.605 --> 05:14:53.241
STUDIES OUT OF UCLA AND USC THAT

05:14:53.307 --> 05:14:53.841
DIRECTLY SAY.

05:14:53.908 --> 05:14:55.176
THIS AFFECTS THE RENTS IN MY

05:14:55.243 --> 05:14:56.777
COMMUNITY SO THIS IS I'M ALREADY

05:14:56.844 --> 05:14:57.778
ONE OF THE MOST -- THE MOST I

05:14:57.845 --> 05:14:59.680
HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING TWO

05:14:59.747 --> 05:15:01.249
AND THREE JOBS RIGHT NOW AND

05:15:01.315 --> 05:15:02.883
BECAUSE OF THE INFLUENCE OF

05:15:02.950 --> 05:15:04.752
AIRBNB AND THAT THESE THE THE

05:15:04.819 --> 05:15:06.220
SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS IT'S

05:15:06.287 --> 05:15:07.388
ACTUALLY DRIVING UP THE RENTS ON

05:15:07.455 --> 05:15:08.256
THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE ACTUALLY

05:15:08.322 --> 05:15:09.624
PEOPLE HAVE TO RAISE THE RENT

05:15:09.690 --> 05:15:10.258
JUST TO COMPETE WITH.

05:15:10.324 --> 05:15:11.892
THOSE AND THEY'RE GETTING MORE

05:15:11.959 --> 05:15:13.961
MONEY SO IT'S IT DIRECTLY

05:15:14.028 --> 05:15:15.296
AFFECTS MY COMMUNITY AND MAKING

05:15:15.363 --> 05:15:19.300
PEOPLE THAT ARE ALREADY WORKING

05:15:19.367 --> 05:15:21.168
TWO JOBS ON FOOD STAMPS AND

05:15:21.235 --> 05:15:22.903
REALLY NOT BEING ABLE TO GET BY

05:15:22.970 --> 05:15:25.406
EVEN MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT AND

05:15:25.473 --> 05:15:26.507
ON ANECDOTAL DATA.

05:15:26.574 --> 05:15:28.276
THOSE ARE GREAT WORDS ONLY

05:15:28.342 --> 05:15:30.211
WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE TO MAKE THAT

05:15:30.278 --> 05:15:32.813
SHOWING YOU SAY YOU'RE CITY IN

05:15:32.880 --> 05:15:34.682
MIGHT MIGHT IN MY CITY IN MY

05:15:34.749 --> 05:15:36.183
SOMETHING.

05:15:36.250 --> 05:15:38.352
IN MY CITY WE POINT WELL IN MY

05:15:38.419 --> 05:15:40.054
CITY WE HAVE WE'RE IN SAN DIEGO

05:15:40.121 --> 05:15:40.288
COUNTY.

05:15:40.354 --> 05:15:41.255
WE'VE SEEN THE HIGHEST PROPERTY

05:15:41.322 --> 05:15:43.924
VALUE INCREASES THE PAST TWO

05:15:43.991 --> 05:15:46.227
YEARS IN A ROW. 10% LAST YEAR

05:15:46.294 --> 05:15:48.062
12% THIS YEAR IT IS IT IS

05:15:48.129 --> 05:15:57.305
OBVIOUS THAT IT IS HAPPENING IN

05:15:57.371 --> 05:15:59.874
MY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW.

05:15:59.940 --> 05:16:01.275
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

05:16:01.342 --> 05:16:03.311
WE HAVE IS -- CITIES THAT

05:16:03.377 --> 05:16:04.011
USUALLY HAVE A PERMITTING

05:16:04.078 --> 05:16:05.246
PROCESS SO WE COULD COUNT THE

05:16:05.313 --> 05:16:05.913
NUMBER OF PERMITS.

05:16:05.980 --> 05:16:06.547
BUT SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL

05:16:06.614 --> 05:16:08.115
PLATFORMS DO NOT RETURN BACK TO

05:16:08.182 --> 05:16:09.250
THE CITIES EVEN THE CITIES THAT

05:16:09.317 --> 05:16:10.151
DO HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH.

05:16:10.217 --> 05:16:11.686
AIRBNB FOR EXAMPLE THEY RETURN A

05:16:11.752 --> 05:16:12.520
LUMP SUM THEY DON'T SAY THIS

05:16:12.586 --> 05:16:13.854
PERSON STATE HERE FOR THIS MANY

05:16:13.921 --> 05:16:14.922
NIGHTS I'M AT THIS LOCATION SO

05:16:14.989 --> 05:16:16.490
IT'S VERY VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY

05:16:16.557 --> 05:16:18.125
WHITTLE DOWN THAT NUMBER AND

05:16:18.192 --> 05:16:19.560
THAT'S HOPEFULLY WHAT.

05:16:19.627 --> 05:16:20.961
SOME OF THE THINGS OF THIS BILL

05:16:21.028 --> 05:16:22.163
WILL DO BECAUSE IT CLICKS TO TEA

05:16:22.229 --> 05:16:22.830
AND MORE.

05:16:22.897 --> 05:16:24.932
SPECIFYING THAT THE NAME OF THE

05:16:24.999 --> 05:16:27.668
THE HOST THE LOCATION AND THE

05:16:27.735 --> 05:16:29.270
NUMBER OF STAYS AND AND THE

05:16:29.337 --> 05:16:31.439
GUEST ALL BE REMITTED BACK TO

05:16:31.505 --> 05:16:32.340
THE CITY SO WE CAN.

05:16:32.406 --> 05:16:34.241
YOU KNOW SO CITY HAS ABILITY TO

05:16:34.308 --> 05:16:35.643
MANAGE THIS IS WHAT'S BEEN LIST

05:16:35.710 --> 05:16:37.378
ON THE PLATFORM AND THIS IS

05:16:37.445 --> 05:16:39.513
WHAT'S BEING ACTUALLY IT WHAT'S

05:16:39.580 --> 05:16:40.581
WITHIN A PERMIT.

05:16:40.648 --> 05:16:42.049
MY CITY WE HAD PAID SOMEBODY

05:16:42.116 --> 05:16:44.352
PART TIME FOR NINE MONTHS JUST

05:16:44.418 --> 05:16:45.853
TO PUT CHECK THE PLATFORMS AND

05:16:45.920 --> 05:16:47.221
THEN ISSUE THEM A LETTER SAYING

05:16:47.288 --> 05:16:49.156
YOU NEED TO HAVE A PERMIT. FIVE

05:16:49.223 --> 05:16:49.790
HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE LISTING ON

05:16:49.857 --> 05:16:51.459
THE PLATFORM THEY DIDN'T HAVE A

05:16:51.525 --> 05:16:53.961
PERMIT IN JUST MY CITY OF SIXTY

05:16:54.028 --> 05:16:54.762
TWO THOUSAND WE ESTIMATE THERE

05:16:54.829 --> 05:16:56.297
ARE FIVE THOUSAND UNITS THAT ARE

05:16:56.364 --> 05:16:58.399
BEING ROOM OF THAT HAVE BEEN

05:16:58.466 --> 05:16:59.400
REMOVED.

05:16:59.467 --> 05:17:00.000
THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTAL

05:17:00.067 --> 05:17:02.103
ZONE DUE TO FULL TIME SHORT TERM

05:17:02.169 --> 05:17:03.938
VACATION RENTALS THIS.

05:17:04.004 --> 05:17:05.439
IF WE CANNOT STOP THE BLEEDING

05:17:05.506 --> 05:17:07.141
OF THE BACK AND NO ONE OF MY

05:17:07.208 --> 05:17:08.209
COMMUNITY IS DOUBLE MORE BECAUSE

05:17:08.275 --> 05:17:09.543
WE'RE JUST GOING TO BLEED AND AN

05:17:09.610 --> 05:17:12.279
EXAMPLE -- COUNCILMEMBER WEST

05:17:12.346 --> 05:17:14.148
GAVE WAS A T. O. D. DEVELOPMENT

05:17:14.215 --> 05:17:15.182
WHEN AND THESE A LOT OF

05:17:15.249 --> 05:17:16.784
POLITICAL CAPITAL TO BUILD IT.

05:17:16.851 --> 05:17:18.085
FOR THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR

05:17:18.152 --> 05:17:19.520
WORKERS FOR PEOPLE OF THIS

05:17:19.587 --> 05:17:22.123
COMMUNITY. TWO HUNDRED UNITS

05:17:22.189 --> 05:17:24.091
MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENT WITHIN

05:17:24.158 --> 05:17:25.726
THREE MONTHS TWENTY FIVE OF

05:17:25.793 --> 05:17:26.694
THOSE TWO HUNDRED UNITS WLL FOR

05:17:26.761 --> 05:17:33.167
ALL TIME SHORT TERM VACATION

05:17:33.234 --> 05:17:34.435
RENTALS.

05:17:34.502 --> 05:17:35.336
THAT'S THE IMPACT OF THE

05:17:35.403 --> 05:17:36.437
PLATFORMS ARE HAVING AND SO I

05:17:36.504 --> 05:17:37.438
THINK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST IF

05:17:37.505 --> 05:17:39.340
WE'RE A HOUSING CRISIS OR SHORT

05:17:39.407 --> 05:17:41.075
TERM VACATION RENTAL CRISIS.

05:17:41.142 --> 05:17:41.609
I'D SAY WE'RE IN A HOUSING

05:17:41.675 --> 05:17:42.676
CRISIS BUT LEADERSHIP QUESTION

05:17:42.743 --> 05:17:43.878
WE PASSED OUT OF GOVERNANCE THE

05:17:43.944 --> 05:17:45.146
MAN'S FIVE YEARS AGO.

05:17:45.212 --> 05:17:46.647
A MEASURE BY SENATOR MCGUIRE

05:17:46.714 --> 05:17:48.349
WHO'S CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE

05:17:48.416 --> 05:17:48.949
CHAIR OF THAT COMMITTEE THAT

05:17:49.016 --> 05:17:49.583
DEALT WITH THIS VERY ISSUE IN

05:17:49.650 --> 05:17:51.819
TERMS OF COLLECTING DATA AND

05:17:51.886 --> 05:17:52.586
WHAT THAT MEANT.

05:17:52.653 --> 05:17:53.187
AND THE QUESTION WAS THE TIME

05:17:53.254 --> 05:17:56.557
THAT INFORMED.

05:17:56.624 --> 05:17:59.326
INFORM THE THINKING HAD TO DO

05:17:59.393 --> 05:18:00.761
WITH THE ALL OF THE ISSUES IS IT

05:18:00.828 --> 05:18:02.563
IT WAS THE BALANCE BETWEEN

05:18:02.630 --> 05:18:04.899
CITIES COLLECTING THE REVENUE

05:18:04.965 --> 05:18:05.399
RIGHT.

05:18:05.466 --> 05:18:07.234
AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE SIGNED UP

05:18:07.301 --> 05:18:10.004
FOR THEIR T. O. T..

05:18:10.070 --> 05:18:11.305
AND REQUIRED THEM TO DO THAT.

05:18:11.372 --> 05:18:12.573
HEY AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND

05:18:12.640 --> 05:18:13.741
THE ISSUE OF GATHERING

05:18:13.808 --> 05:18:15.409
INFORMATION ABOUT WHO'S DOING

05:18:15.476 --> 05:18:16.844
WHAT AND HOW THEY'RE DOING IT.

05:18:16.911 --> 05:18:18.279
AND AND WHAT THE AUDIT

05:18:18.345 --> 05:18:19.613
PROVISIONS WERE IN THE REAL.

05:18:19.680 --> 05:18:20.981
FOCUS WAS COLLECTING THE MONEY

05:18:21.048 --> 05:18:22.283
BECAUSE THEY WERE SIDE STEPPING

05:18:22.349 --> 05:18:23.851
THE MONEY AND THE UNDERLYING

05:18:23.918 --> 05:18:25.019
ARGUMENT WAS WHAT WE WANT TO

05:18:25.085 --> 05:18:26.620
FIND OUT THE SITUATION SO WE CAN

05:18:26.687 --> 05:18:28.055
GATHER NAY BUT NEIGHBORHOODS ARE

05:18:28.122 --> 05:18:29.857
GO AFTER PEOPLE AND GATHER

05:18:29.924 --> 05:18:31.125
INFORMATION FOR THAT STUFF.

05:18:31.192 --> 05:18:32.259
AND THAT WAS THE BALANCE THAT

05:18:32.326 --> 05:18:34.094
WAS STRUCK AND NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE

05:18:34.161 --> 05:18:35.529
BASICALLY TOUCHING THAT ISSUE

05:18:35.596 --> 05:18:36.630
THAT WE WITHOUT NOT TO SAY IT

05:18:36.697 --> 05:18:37.164
SHOULDN'T CHANGE I'M NOT

05:18:37.231 --> 05:18:38.332
SUGGESTING THAT.

05:18:38.399 --> 05:18:39.600
BUT I'M JUST SUGGESTING WE WE

05:18:39.667 --> 05:18:41.335
SPENT MONTHS AND MONTHS GOING TO

05:18:41.402 --> 05:18:45.272
THIS VERY ISSUE IN GOVERNANCE

05:18:45.339 --> 05:18:45.906
FINANCE WHEN I WAS CHAIRING THE

05:18:45.973 --> 05:18:48.209
COMMITTEE.

05:18:48.275 --> 05:18:48.809
DEALING WITH IT AND WE DECIDED

05:18:48.876 --> 05:18:49.610
ON A STRUCTURE THAT RELATEDTO

05:18:49.677 --> 05:18:50.110
COLLECTION WAS THE MOST

05:18:50.177 --> 05:18:51.111
IMPORTANT THING TO COMPENSATE

05:18:51.178 --> 05:18:51.779
CITIES.

05:18:51.846 --> 05:18:53.047
RATHER THAN GATHERING

05:18:53.113 --> 05:18:55.449
INFORMATION THAT THEN COULD.

05:18:55.516 --> 05:18:57.818
YOU DEAL WITH SOME OF KIND OF

05:18:57.885 --> 05:19:00.888
THE THE THE PLEASE POWER ISSUE

05:19:00.955 --> 05:19:02.857
UNDERSTOOD AND IF IT HELPS AT

05:19:02.923 --> 05:19:03.724
ALL THIS IS.

05:19:03.791 --> 05:19:05.259
REFERRED ALSO TO GOVERNANCE AND

05:19:05.326 --> 05:19:06.160
FINANCE SO THEY'LL HAVE AN

05:19:06.227 --> 05:19:07.661
OPPORTUNITY WHEN SHOULD IT PASS

05:19:07.728 --> 05:19:09.730
COMMITTEE TODAY BUT I APPRECIATE

05:19:09.797 --> 05:19:13.767
THE THE WAY IN THERE -- SEEING

05:19:13.834 --> 05:19:14.468
NO OTHER.

05:19:14.535 --> 05:19:15.369
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I

05:19:15.436 --> 05:19:19.707
APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH

05:19:19.773 --> 05:19:22.643
DISCUSSION -- WHEN IT IS A

05:19:22.710 --> 05:19:23.944
RESPONSE TO SENATOR HURTS FOR

05:19:24.011 --> 05:19:25.813
WHAT WE GOT TO WRAP THIS UP HERE

05:19:25.880 --> 05:19:26.480
THE OF A QUICK?

05:19:26.547 --> 05:19:28.115
FACTS COUPLE OF CLARIFICATIONS

05:19:28.182 --> 05:19:28.849
ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION PIECE

05:19:28.916 --> 05:19:29.416
I DON'T BELIEVE THE COASTAL

05:19:29.483 --> 05:19:30.751
COMMISSION HAS TAKEN ANY

05:19:30.818 --> 05:19:32.586
POSITION I DON'T THINK IT'S DO

05:19:32.653 --> 05:19:33.354
GET OUT OF THERE TO PROVIDE

05:19:33.420 --> 05:19:34.822
THROUGH NOT TAKING AND THEY HAVE

05:19:34.889 --> 05:19:36.123
NOT TAKEN A POSITION OKAY.

PLACE WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH AND

06:07:49.480 --> 06:07:52.383
SAFETY IS OUR MOST CRITICAL NEED

06:07:52.450 --> 06:07:54.385
IN URBAN AREAS AND SO WILL THE

06:07:54.452 --> 06:07:55.920
MOMENT SO WE HAVE SHARED WITH MR

06:07:55.987 --> 06:07:57.622
BLOOM AND HIS STAFF AND THE

06:07:57.688 --> 06:07:59.023

06:07:59.090 --> 06:08:01.559
JUST QUICKLY AND I WILL FINISH

06:08:01.626 --> 06:08:02.293

06:08:02.360 --> 06:08:05.463
A PROCESS THAT ONE HAS A FUNDING.

06:08:05.530 --> 06:08:07.265
ENFORCEMENT AND THAT FUNDING

06:08:07.331 --> 06:08:08.699
WOULD COME FROM.

06:08:08.766 --> 06:08:10.435
THE INDUSTRY.

06:08:10.501 --> 06:08:12.470
IF YOU'RE A PCO IN SIXTY TO

06:08:12.537 --> 06:08:14.005
CALIFORNIA AND YOU WANT TO USE

06:08:14.071 --> 06:08:15.807
THIS CAR IN A BIG BOX HE WOULD

06:08:15.873 --> 06:08:17.608
BUY A STICKER YOU'D PAY A FEE

06:08:17.675 --> 06:08:18.943
FOR THAT STICKER THAT FEE WOULD

06:08:19.010 --> 06:08:20.812

USE OF THOSE MATERIALS.

06:08:39.130 --> 06:08:42.633
IN THE APPLICATION AND THE

06:08:42.700 --> 06:08:43.968
CONTROL OF COMMENSAL RODENTS.

06:08:44.035 --> 06:08:45.536
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A OF A

06:08:45.603 --> 06:08:49.707
BETTER WAY TO CONTROL THE ACCESS

06:08:49.774 --> 06:08:51.943
OF THESE MATERIALS TO WILDLIFE

06:08:52.009 --> 06:08:52.710

MARIJUANA GROWS UP AND DOWN THE

YOU CAN STILL BUY THESE

06:09:17.869 --> 06:09:18.903
THIS BILL DOES NOTHING FOR

TALK WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

06:09:34.285 --> 06:09:34.752
WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

06:09:34.819 --> 06:09:35.586
ACCOMPLISH.

06:09:35.653 --> 06:09:36.921
IN WORK THROUGH THIS BECAUSE WE

OPPORTUNITY TO THAT.

06:09:48.432 --> 06:09:49.867
YOU HAVE RECENT CONVERSATIONS IN

06:09:49.934 --> 06:09:51.736

DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE I BELIEVE

ALONG WITH OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

06:43:01.957 --> 06:43:03.225

ENERGY SEE SIERRA CLUB DVD AND

06:43:04.827 --> 06:43:05.127
OTHERS.

06:43:05.194 --> 06:43:06.929
OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS

06:43:06.996 --> 06:43:09.365
ELIMINATING THE POSSIBILITY OF

06:43:09.431 --> 06:43:11.333
CALIFORNIA CONTINUING TO BE

06:43:11.400 --> 06:43:12.668
ALLOWED ALLOWING A LEGAL.

06:43:12.735 --> 06:43:14.136
A LEGAL MARKET TO HAVE AN

06:43:14.203 --> 06:43:15.804
ILLEGAL MARKET FLOURISH HERE AND

06:43:15.871 --> 06:43:16.672
DURING MY PRIOR TESTIMONY I

06:43:16.739 --> 06:43:18.974
IDENTIFIED ALL THE WAYS THAT

06:43:19.041 --> 06:43:20.843
THAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

06:43:20.910 --> 06:43:23.379
AND SO FOR US WE ARE INTERESTED

06:43:23.445 --> 06:43:24.647
IN MY CLIENTS HAVE BEEN IN

06:43:24.713 --> 06:43:26.048
DISCUSSION WITH THE PROPONENTS

06:43:26.115 --> 06:43:27.416
WHO CHOSE TO CONTACT MY CLIENTS

06:43:27.483 --> 06:43:29.051
DIRECTLY A COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND

06:43:29.118 --> 06:43:30.286
DISCUSS IT WITH THEM.

06:43:30.352 --> 06:43:32.755
IT'S INTERESTING TO THINK ABOUT

06:43:32.821 --> 06:43:33.923
A TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM WE WERE THE

06:43:33.989 --> 06:43:35.224
ONES THAT BROUGHT THAT

06:43:35.291 --> 06:43:36.225
CONVERSATION UP.

06:43:36.292 --> 06:43:37.760
BUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT'S

06:43:37.826 --> 06:43:40.329
DEVELOPED IT'S SUPER COMPLICATED --

06:43:40.396 --> 06:43:41.830
WITH THE LAYERS OF STATE FEDERAL

06:43:41.897 --> 06:43:42.998

06:43:43.065 --> 06:43:44.366
SURE COMPLICATED FOR THE SUPPLY

06:43:44.433 --> 06:43:45.634
CHAIN AND CHAIN OF CUSTODY

06:43:45.701 --> 06:43:47.102
ISSUES TO IMPLEMENT ON THE

06:43:47.169 --> 06:43:48.437
MANUFACTURING SIDE.

06:43:48.504 --> 06:43:50.272
BUT IT WOULD MATTER TO US THAT

06:43:50.339 --> 06:43:51.974
WE NOT KICKED THE CAN AND ALLOWS

06:43:52.041 --> 06:43:53.976
SALES TO CONTINUE WHILE THAT IS

06:43:54.043 --> 06:43:55.878
DEVELOPED AND IF THAT MEANS THAT

06:43:55.945 --> 06:43:56.645
THIS INDUSTRY.

06:43:56.712 --> 06:43:57.646
DOESN'T GET TO SELL FOR A FEW

06:43:57.713 --> 06:43:59.081
MONTHS THAT'S THE KIND OF FIRE

06:43:59.148 --> 06:44:00.950
THAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE SET

06:44:01.016 --> 06:44:02.418
BECAUSE ALL THE RESPECT I'VE SAT

06:44:02.484 --> 06:44:04.486

06:44:04.553 --> 06:44:05.220
EXTENSIONS.

06:44:05.287 --> 06:44:07.056
RAISING THESE ISSUES EVERY

06:44:07.122 --> 06:44:09.258
SINGLE TIME AND I KNOW IT FEELS

06:44:09.325 --> 06:44:10.492
LIKE AN EMERGENCY TODAY BUT

06:44:10.559 --> 06:44:13.195
THAT'S BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT.

06:44:13.262 --> 06:44:14.363
FOLLOWED THROUGHOUT ALL THESE

06:44:14.430 --> 06:44:15.264
YEARS OUR CONCERNS WERE NEVER

06:44:15.331 --> 06:44:16.699
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND NOW WE ARE

06:44:16.765 --> 06:44:18.767
HAVE EVIDENCE OF ILLEGAL

06:44:18.834 --> 06:44:19.535
SHIPMENTS COMING.

06:44:19.602 --> 06:44:20.836

OF THE COUNTRY.

06:44:32.681 --> 06:44:34.984
AND THE IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A

06:44:35.050 --> 06:44:36.285
HALT TO SALES -- TEMPORARILY TO

06:44:36.352 --> 06:44:38.153
MOTIVATE TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY

06:44:38.220 --> 06:44:39.221
WE'RE THERE TO WORK ON ON DOING

06:44:39.288 --> 06:44:39.922
THAT IT'S IT'S NOT A

06:44:39.989 --> 06:44:40.789

PERSPECTIVE IT'S A PROTECTING

06:44:43.525 --> 06:44:44.526
ENDANGERED AND IMPERILED SPECIES

06:44:44.593 --> 06:44:45.661
