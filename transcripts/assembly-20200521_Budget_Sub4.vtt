01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:23.264
EXPAND. SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:24.299
ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT WILL

01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:29.070

TRY TO ANSWER THOSE BASIC

01:23:34.843 --> 01:23:39.247
QUESTIONS- AND WE CONTINUE TO

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.049
LOOK AT EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:44.819
TO EXCESS- THE PUBLIC IN MAKING

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:45.720
SURE THEY KNOW HOW TO NAVIGATE

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.655
OR SYSTEM. AND I KNOW OF THIS

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.624
IT IS VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.626
YOU AYE PROGRAM IS COMPLEX AND

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.761
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MANY

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:54.229
MANY PEOPLE ARE ON ARE

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:56.264
UNEMPLOYED. AND IT'S THEIR

01:23:56.331 --> 01:24:00.435
FIRST- EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. SO

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.003
EVERYTHING YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:05.273

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:05.840
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:06.541
HAVE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO GO

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.009
THROUGH THOROUGHLY FRUSTRATING

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:08.810
EXPERIENCE TO TRY TO GET.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:11.913
THROUGH ONE AREA AND I KNOW OUR

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:12.881
COLLEAGUES TOUCH ON THIS IS

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.917
AROUND ID VERIFICATION WHICH-

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:17.352
WE HAVE HAD CONSTITUENTS WHO

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:18.653
HAD FOR FOUR WEEKS BEFORE

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:20.522
THEY'RE EVEN NOTIFIED OF AN ID

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:21.856
VERIFICATION ISSUE. AND THEN

01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:22.824
AND SOME OF THOSE CASES IT

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.226
TAKES ANOTHER THREE WEEKS

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:26.127
BEFORE THEIR ID'S BEEN VERIFIED

01:24:26.194 --> 01:24:28.296
AND IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THE-

01:24:28.363 --> 01:24:30.665
COULD PREVENTABLE YOU KNOW YOU

TIME WE'RE DONE WITH THAT

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.721
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS DECIDED ON

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:28.422
IS GOING TO BE OUT OF DATE. AND

01:30:28.489 --> 01:30:31.459
SO KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE I'M-

01:30:31.526 --> 01:30:33.394
AYE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY.

01:30:33.461 --> 01:30:35.730
INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING I THINK-

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:38.232
IT YOU KNOW AS I'VE BEEN IT'S

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:39.967
BEEN SUGGESTED TO ME STARTED IN

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.036
OUR TEAM WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.204
AND MEDIA EXPERIENCES LITTLE

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:45.807
BIT. HI AMY STILL. BACKED EACH

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:50.578

AGREED SO TO PREVENT THAT

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.020
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT SEVERAL

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:01.222
OUT OF SYSTEM THAT WAS JUST

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:02.590
GOING TO BE OBSOLETE IN DAY ONE

01:31:02.657 --> 01:31:05.426
SO- PART OF OUR PROCESS AS WE

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:06.694
ARE GOING FOR OUR SHOW OFF THE

01:31:06.761 --> 01:31:09.564
SHELF. OFFICIAL ON PRODUCT. OF

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:10.998
WHICH IS USED IN MANY OTHER

01:31:11.065 --> 01:31:12.900
STATE SENATE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:16.003
USE FOR OUR TAX SYSTEM. SO IT'S

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.271
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VENDOR

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:19.340

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:22.043
AN UPDATE AND BEST PRACTICES.

TO. UTILIZE WILL BE A SYSTEM

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:35.923
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO STAY

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:39.060
CURRENT AND FLEXIBLE- I THINK

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:41.195
BACK WHEN WE HAD ALL THOSE

01:31:41.262 --> 01:31:42.964

CONFIDENCE AND WHAT'S

01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:19.426
HAPPENING. BUT TO ALSO BE ABLE

01:38:19.493 --> 01:38:22.529
TO SHOW TO THEM THAT THERE IS A

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:23.163
LIGHT AND THE AT THE END OF THE

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:26.100
TUNNEL. AND THE PROBLEM. BECAME

01:38:26.166 --> 01:38:28.402
EXACERBATED WHEN WE STOP

01:38:28.469 --> 01:38:32.039

01:38:39.146 --> 01:38:40.347
ACCOUNTABILITY WE'VE ASKED

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.816
ABOUT WHAT WHEN WE CAN EXPECT

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:45.619
CERTAIN THINGS TO HAPPEN BUT I

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:46.820
THINK IT BEHOOVES YOU ANY

01:38:46.887 --> 01:38:49.723
BECOMES EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:52.159
THAT OUR COMMUNICATION NEVER

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:55.396
BREAKS DOWN. SO THAT WE KNOW

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:57.931
WHAT WE ARE ALSO EXPLAINING TO

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:59.266
OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THAT WHAT

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:02.903
WE EXPLAIN TO THEM IS ACCURATE.

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.339
AND CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:39:05.406 --> 01:39:09.943
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE. SO THAT'S

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:11.779
ONE POINT ANOTHER POINT WAS I

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.147
THINK MR GLORIA TOUCHED ON THIS

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:15.582

01:39:17.818 --> 01:39:18.752
WERE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:19.987
WAYS OF COMMUNICATION AND IT

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.689
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LACK TIME

01:39:21.755 --> 01:39:23.057
WHEN THE COMMUNICATION TAKES

01:39:23.123 --> 01:39:25.225
PLACE THROUGH MAIL. WHY AREN'T

01:39:28.062 --> 01:39:29.396
THAT PEOPLE CAN AND IT'S A

01:39:29.463 --> 01:39:30.998
CHEAPER MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY

01:39:31.065 --> 01:39:32.666
AS WELL. THERE MIGHT BE

01:39:32.733 --> 01:39:34.168

YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH AND I'D

01:39:35.502 --> 01:39:36.970
BE INTERESTED TO KNOW IF. THAT

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.605
IS ONE OF THE REASONS BUT- WHY

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:40.007
AREN'T WE BETTER EMPLOYING

01:39:40.074 --> 01:39:41.408
EMAILS SO THAT THE

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:43.110

AS MUCH AS WE EXPECTED TO SEE

01:39:52.219 --> 01:39:53.387
ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS

COULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE

01:50:58.451 --> 01:50:59.686
AND I THINK. IF IT'S IF IT'S

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:00.954
THE LATTER THERE'S A LOT OF

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.789
CONCERN THAT THIS ONE POINT

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:22.242
VERY GRATEFUL THAT THE

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.243
