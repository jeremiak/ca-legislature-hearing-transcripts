GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND. MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I PRESENT TO YOU A. B. TWENTY THREE TWELVE. AS A TWO POINT FOUR TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY CALIFORNIA REMAINS AN ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR BUSINESS. HOWEVER OTHER STATES HAVE RECENTLY PROVIDED INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES TO START NEW INVESTMENTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES. AND NOT SO MUCH HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY THREE TWELVE WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO REMAIN ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE AS WELL AS ATTRACT JOB CREATION. AND RETENTION. BUSINESSES AT OUR REGION THE SIGNIFICANT TO THE AREA IN QUESTION WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM MAYBE TWENTY THREE TWELVE. IF THEY MEET CERTAIN HIRING AND INVESTMENT TARGETS SET FORTH. IN WRITING WITH GOLD IS. THE AWARD CAN BE USED TOWARDS A TAXPAYERS LIABILITY AND CAN BE UTILIZED IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS IF THEIR TAX LIABILITY IS LESS THAN THE AWARD. AWARDED AMOUNT. AB TWENTY TWELVE WILL HELP. INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES WHO WISH TO DO WORK IN OUR STATE BY GIVING THEM MORE CERTAINTY REGARDING ECONOMIC RESOURCES. AND INCENTIVES BY GIVING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE TOOLS TO PROPERLY INCENTIVIZE BUSINESSES THEY WILL BE BETTER SUITED. TO PROVIDE STABILITY AND RETAIN MORE CONTROL OVER THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH. I'M PLEASED TO CONFIRM THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WE VIEW THEM AS IMPORTANT POSITIVE REFINEMENTS TO THE BILL AND THANK THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR THE SUGGEST IMPROVEMENTS. THAT WITH ME TODAY HAVE A TING CALLIE PRESIDENT IMPAIR VALLEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY TWELFTH. THANK YOU WELCOME. THANK YOU ULTRA WOMAN QUIRK SILVA. I'M COMMITTEE IT'S IT'S HONORED HERE TODAY. AND THE PRESIDENCY KNOW THEM PEARL VALLEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION IMPERIAL COUNTY. IS THE ONLY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BORDERS ANOTHER COUNTRY IN ANOTHER STATE. AND WE ARE VERY COMPETITIVE WITH BOTH MEXICO AND ARIZONA BY TAB WITH CIVIL INSTANCES. IN WHICH WERE NOT ABLE TO COMPETE AT A LEVEL IN WHICH ARE ABLE TO RETAIN. AND ATTRACT BUSINESSES I THIS BILL IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO DO THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO. A MARKET THE REGION BETTER BUT I WANT TO BRING UP A COUPLE POINTS IN FIRST ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE RETENTION. A THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WE SEE A LOT OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND MANY OF THESE. AYE MERGERS HAVE BEEN WITH COMPANIES THAT OPERATE BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA. A ONE SUCH COMPANY FRESH EXPRESS. ACQUIRED ACCOMPANYING KILLED CALIFORNIA WHICH ALSO OWNED A COMPANY IN YUMA ARIZONA. AND THAT IN DECIDING TO CLOSE ONE OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE LOCATIONS BECAUSE ONLY SIXTY. A MILES APART THEY CLOSE LOCATION IN EL CENTRO DISPLACING OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN EMPLOYEES WITH. A ANCILLARY BENEFIT OR BENEFIT ARIZONA WAS GREAT BENEFIT BUT TO OUR REGION WAS PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. AND THAT'S WHAT'S IS ONE EXAMPLE OF OF HOW THIS TELETYPEWRITER GRAHAM COULD HAVE. A THROUGH OUR A RAPID RESPONSE EFFORTS COULD RETAIN THAT TYPE OF COMPANY. AND YET THROUGH THE YOU CAL COMPETES PROGRAM IT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IN OUR OUR DECISION OR THE DECISION OF THE COMPANIES WITHIN ABOUT. THIRTY DAYS A CAL COMPETE PROGRAM CAN WORK AND DOES WORK AYE US GYPSUM IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. THEY DID EXPANSION HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHERE COMPETING GETS NEVADA WOULD BEST BUT A SIX MONTH PROCESS NOR PREPARE PREPARE FOR THAT. AND IN DOING SO WE'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE CAL COMPETES TAX CREDITS AND THEIR DECISION WAS TO NOT ONLY STAY CALIFORNIA BE EXPAND. AND CREATE ABOUT A HUNDRED JOBS THAT PROCESS TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR. BUT DURING THAT TIME WERE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD VERY QUICKLY. WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT COMPANIES TO CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE THAT TIME. AB WE HAVE LITERALLY DAYS. TO MAKE DECISIONS AND PROVIDE INFORMATION TO COMPANIES. IN A COUPLE MONTHS I WILL BE GOING TO WASHINGTON DC IN COOPERATION WITH GOBIZ TO SELECT USA. WILL BE MEETING WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES COMPETING AGAINST ALL STATES IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR THOSE A COMPANIES LOOKING TO INVEST IN UNITED STATES AND WHAT WE CONTINUALLY SEE. IS THE LACK OF THE TOOLS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA A TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THOSE COMPANIES. THAT CALIFORNIA IS IS GREAT STATE WE HAVE A GREAT GREAT PROGRAMS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BE ABLE TO TO MAKE DECISIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL PROVIDE INCENTIVES. TO COMPANIES TO MAKE A DECISION TO COME TO CALIFORNIA WE LIKE THOSE THIS BILL IS GOING TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AS RESERVE DOLLARS FOR THE FUTURE TO BE CARRIED OVER SO THE LOCAL LEVEL WE CAN MOVE PROJECTS FORWARD QUICKER. AND GIVE AND GIVE COMPANIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AL A RELIEF KNOWING THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND THE PROCESS IS NOT ONLY HOPE. BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S CLOSER TO GUARANTEE THAT THERE WILL BE AN INCENTIVE OF THOSE COMPANIES DECIDE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA. LIKE I SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S VERY IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL IN OUR TRACTION EFFORTS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY VALUABLE TOOL IN THE RETENTION. AND EXPANSION EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE CALIFORNIA. OKAY THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HERE THAT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR OR ARE SUPPORT WITNESS. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AT THIS TIME DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT DO WE HAVE ANYBODY SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE ASK OUR AUTHOR TO CLOSE. I AM I WOULD LIKE TO JUST SAY I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM IN A GREAT A PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WANNA COMPLEMENT THE AUTHOR I UNDERSTAND WILK HILL FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IT'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE FOR US TO RETAIN. OUT OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE LOOKING TO MOVE ON AND THEN TO ATTRACT NEW BUSINESSES TO OUR COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A VALUABLE TOOL. AND IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER ADDING ME AS COAUTHOR IS IT MOVES THROUGH THE LEGISLATION I'D BE GREATLY HONORED. YES I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I FULLY SUPPORTED IN MY TO ALSO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. YOU DIDN'T. BUT WHEREVER. MOTION TO MOVE IN A SECOND AND YOU DID ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION AGAIN JUST A LITTLE TESTIMONY ON WHAT THIS BILL WOULD LOOK LIKE GIVING AN EXAMPLE OF THE BUSINESS. I LIKE TO DO THAT BECAUSE IN THIS ROOM WERE KIND OF A PEOPLE THAT ARE READING ALL THE LEGISLATION BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO WATCH THESE HEARINGS THAT AREN'T IN THE ROOM AND I LIKE THEM TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. A WHAT IS IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE THE BILL IF YOU. THE TITLE SAYS A TAXATION SO GIVES AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT LOOKS WELL YEAH SO AM. I THINK. ONE OF THE AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS WITH CAL COMPETES PROGRAM IS NOT ALL OF THE DOLLARS A UTILIZED IN A GIVEN YEAR. AND THIS ALLOW FOR CARRY OVER BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT TO DEDICATE. THOSE FUNDS THROUGH A LOCAL LEVEL TO WEAR AS WERE MARKETING OUR REGION. THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO MARKET AND. IN A WAY THAT SAYS THAT WE HAVE TAX CREDITS ARE AVAILABLE. THAT WE CAN SUPPORT YOUR BUSINESS AND AND THE ARMS. CAL COMPETES PROGRAM IS STILL IN PLACE THIS IS DISTANT DECISIONS ARE STILL MADE. AT THE COMMITTEE LEVEL BUT IT GIVES THEM THE LOCAL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO UTILIZE THE CAL COMPETES IN A IN A WAY THAT'S GOING MAKE UP THOSE COMPANIES MORE COMPETITIVE. FOR ON THE TAX CREDITS AND IT'S GOING ALLOWED THE COUNTIES AND CITIES. TO SUPPORT THOSE BUSINESSES AND I THINK THAT THAT. IS GOING BENEFIT AND NOT ONLY IN THE ATTRACTION EFFORTS BUT ALSO IS GOING BENEFIT IN UTILIZING THIS TAX CREDITS TO RETAIN. AND COMPANIES IN OUR REGION. OKAY SO AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY IF YOU WERE OUT THERE IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WHETHER IT BE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR ANOTHER STATE DC. AND THEY'RE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE THAT DECISION ABOUT WHERE DO THEY REALLY WANT TO SET UP SHOP IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY. AND WE CAN NOW SAY WE CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT THERE WILL BE SOME TYPE OF SUPPORT THROUGH TAX CREDITS THIS COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE OF FROM THE FOR THEM DECIDING TO STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO. AS YOU CAN SEE OF THAT TYPE OF ASSURANCE I THINK IS WHAT BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN ASKING US MANY TIMES IS WE NEED THE CONFIDENCE TO KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SUPPORT SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAD A MOTION TO. TO MOVE FORWARD IN A SECOND AND. MISTER SECRETARY. ITEM NUMBER ONE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE TWELVE. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON REVENUE AND TAXATION. CHAIR QUIRK SILVA. VICE CHAIR ALAN. COOLEY. COOLEY AYE. BERMAN. CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE. GARCIA. GARCIA. STEINORTH. STEINORTH I. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK ARTS OF A MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THAT BILL OLBIA PUT ON CALL. ALRIGHT AND JUST TELL A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT WE ACTUALLY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE. THIS AS AB TWO NINE SEVEN FOUR ON CONSENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RATES WILL ACTUALLY BE PRESENTING THAT SO. ALRIGHT SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO ITEM TO AB TWO FIVE NINE SIX CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN AND WE HAVE.ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY HERE. WELL COULDN'T A ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY AND MEMBERS OUT THERE WE HAVE SOME EXCITEMENT GOING ON IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE CHARTS. ETHNIC. HOW KINDS OF THINGS ALRIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER? COOLEY. WELL COLLEAGUES I AM VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY PRESENTED AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SIX. AND THE OBJECT OF THIS BILL IS REALLY. TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR ECONOMIC STRENGTH IN CALIFORNIA LOOK AT THE FRAILTIES. LOOK AT HOW DO WE PRODUCE A LONG TERM STRATEGIC APPROACH TO GROWING OUR ECONOMY. WHICH IS VITAL NOT JUST TORE CITIZENS BUT REALLY GLOBALLY. GLOBALLY SIGNIFICANT CALIFORNIA PAVING THE WAY CREATING JOBS. SO THE AIM OF THIS BILL IS TO DEVELOP A CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN. AND. IDEF ONE A NOTE THANK. THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK WITH AMENDMENTS ITEM COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. JUST THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TONY SIMON'S WHO I'VE KNOWN SO LONG THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. AND BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING JOBS OF COURSE IS THE MOMENT WHEN YOU YOU POINT OUT THE CALIFORNIA'S THIS WORLD SIX LARGEST ECONOMY. BUT WHATEVER I HERE THAT I FEEL LIKE OUT A WHISTLE A FEW BARS. THERE'S AN ASPECT OF AFFIRMING THAT WHICH IS CERTAINLY TRUE IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD. HOW DO WE SUSTAIN OUR ECONOMY HOW DO WE GROW OUR ECONOMY? WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVEYARD IS WHAT YOU DO TO CHEER YOURSELF UP. WHEN YOU YOU WANT TO BE CHEERED UP SO WE ARE THE SIX LARGE ECONOMY BUT WE DO NEED TO BE GROWING. GROWING CONSTANTLY. AND. DESPITE OUR STATUS AS THE SIX LARGE ECONOMY CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE. SOME ECONOMIC CHALLENGES WHICH ARE CRITICAL. OUR PROSPERITY IS LOCALIZED AROUND THE STATE'S WRITTEN REGION STATE ABOUND OTHER PLACES. ECONOMIC GROWTH IS POOR MEAGER THIS AFFECTS ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THE SENSE OF HOPE ACROSS RURAL STATE. AND SO THOSE INEQUITIES. ARE BOUND UP IN THIS QUESTION HOW DO WE GROW OUR ECONOMY. THEREFORE THIS BILL IS REALLY A LEADERSHIP BILL. AND BEFORE I TURN TO MY WITNESSES. I'D LIKE TO OFFER A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT HOW I THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND WHY THIS BILL FITS INTO THAT. IN ITS MOST BASIC FORM LEADERSHIP IS. CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN THE PHRASE YOU CANNOT BLOW AN UNCERTAIN TRUMPET. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN YOU NEED TO BE CLEAR AND COMPELLING. AND ON THAT MESSAGE ALL THE TIME. AND THAT IS THAT IS IMPORTANT TO LEADERSHIP. BLOWING A CLEAR COMPELLING TRUMPET. BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. YOU ALSO NEED TO GET DOWN AND SAY WELL WORDS LEADERSHIP NEED HAPPENED ONE OF THE CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU DIVERT THOSE WE TO START TO HAVE AN IMPACT. A AND THAT ACTUALLY IS WORK. IT'S INTELLECTUALLY BRITS ARE WORKERS LAWMAKERS. A. A FAVORITE COMMENT ON THIS ON THIS CHALLENGES ONE OF FDR. WHO? ACTUALLY APPOINTED MY GRANDFATHER POSTMASTER OF HEALDSBURG CALIFORNIA. FDR LIKE TO SAILORS REMEMBERED FOR SAYING THE TEST OF A FIRST RATE INTELLIGENCE. IS YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HOLD TWO OPPOSED IDEAS IN THE MIND OF THE SAME TIME. ONE SHOULD FOR EXAMPLE BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THINGS ARE HOPELESS. AND YET BE DETERMINED MAKE THEM OTHERWISE. AND I THINK WHEN YOU START LOOKING TO IT ISSUE LIKE HOW DO WE REALLY IS. PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS. LABOR TO GET A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO GROWING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. GIVEN THE SCALE THE MAGNITUDE OF CALIFORNIA AT US BOTH A DAUNTING. ALMOST HOPELESS PROSPECT. BUT ONE BEGUN WORK ON. AND. SO THEN IT BECOMES OF HIM SOLUTION PROBLEM HOW DO YOU WORK ON IT. I HAVE A QUOTE FOR THAT TOO THAT'S THOMAS EDISON. THOMAS EDISON THE GREAT INVENTOR WHO SAID. THERE CAMINO. THERE COULD BE NO PROGRESS. UNTIL A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT. BECOME DISSATISFIED. THE WAY THINGS ARE. AND THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN WHEN THEY'RE BROUGHT THINK BEYOND THE LIMITS TO WHICH THEIR CUSTOM. SO I THINK A CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR GREAT ECONOMY HOW BOOM IT IS DOZEN TAIL LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE WEAKNESSES. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO BE DISSATISFIED ABOUT. AND REALLY. ONE OF THE PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT WE CAN TARGET. WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL IS GOING AFTER. AND THIS THEN CONCLUDES BEFORE WITH MY OWN QUOTED MYSELF THERE IS A LEADERSHIP SYLLOGISM FOR HOW YOU MOVE PEOPLE FORWARD. AND BASS INVOLVES SAYING HERE'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHICH IS BAD FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. HERE'S VERY BE TOMORROW WHICH IF WE DID THAT WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. HERE'S HOW YOU GO FROM A TO BE. AND THAT IS BY. INTRODUCTION OF AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY SIX WHY THIS BILL ASKS. OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GOBIZ TO DEVELOP FOR OUR STATE. STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN BUT THE GROWTH OF OUR ECONOMY IN CONCERT WITH THE STATE'S BUSINESSES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ARM. THE. THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED COMMISSION A STUDY THAT INCLUDES IDENTIFICATION ECONOMIC GOALS IMPEDIMENTS OF THOSE GOALS EVALUATES EFFECTIVE STATES CURRENT ECONOMIC. PROGRAMS I HAVE WITH ME VERY BROOM HERE IN SACRAMENTO. PART OF THE THE LEADER OF THE GREATER SEPARATE YOU CAN ON THE COUNCIL AND CRIMINALIST BURKE OF THE BAY AREA COUNCIL. SO THEY'RE DYING TO SEE THOSE CHARTS GENTLEMAN. SO MR BROOM IF YOU WILL OPEN AND WE WILL PROCEED AS IT CAME UP HERE. THANK YOU LAMBERTON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M A I'M A ROOKIE SO. I'LL TRY AND DO A GOOD JOB. SO. I'VE BEEN IN CALIFORNIA THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPER FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS FROM OHIO IN MICHIGAN. AND WHEN I FIRST CAME IN THE CALIFORNIA I WAS AND BUILT A SORT OF IT ORGANIZATION FROM SCRATCH I WAS LOOKING FOR THE PLAN I WOULD PLUG INTO. IT BECAUSE THE STATE SETS THE STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE DIRECTION FOR ALL THE COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID WAS STEM CELL RESEARCH OPENS UP THAT MARKET FOR A SACRAMENTO COMMUNITY. WHAT YOU DO ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN DEMAND POLICIES FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES WELL THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD ELECTRIC VEHICLE CORRIDOR IN A COMMUNITY LIKE SACRAMENTO? AND. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW WAS IN A VERY LARGE COMPLEX STATE DOING A LOT OF FASCINATING THINGS AND. YOU ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. THE BAY AREA COUNCIL THAT IS HERE IS I WENT DOWN AND SAW JIM WONDERMENT AND ASKED HIM ABOUT TO PLUG INTO A PLAN WITH. THE BAY AREA COUNCIL THEY WERE MORE PROMINENT HAD MORE INFLUENCE WE DID AND SO WE BUILT A MEGA REGION STRATEGY BETWEEN THE BAY AREA COUNCIL ON US. AND WE HAVE THE SAME STRATEGY AROUND CHINA BUSINESS RETENTION IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NOW STARTING TO SHARE SOME STRATEGIES AROUND THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION. THAT HELPS A BAY AREA COUNCIL BECAUSE THEY GET ANOTHER PARTNER HIS CLOSE THE STATE CAPITAL THAT HELPS US BECAUSE WE GET AN ORGANIZATION WITH REAL LIFTING POWER AND. WHEN YOU'RE DO YOU'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF BUT ONE OF MY GREAT FRUSTRATIONS EVEN WHEN I WAS IN A CALIFORNIAN WAS WATCHING RICK PERRY COME TO CALIFORNIA. AND TALK ABOUT OUR STATE AND NOT SEE A MEASURED RESPONSE TO HIS COMMENTS. AND IT REALLY FRUSTRATED ME A TO SEE THAT AND SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID AS AN ORGANIZATION RICK SCOTT CAME INTO LOS ANGELES. THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA TO TAKE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES OUT OF SOUTH CAROLINA. ARE AT A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO FLORIDA. AND HE WAS TOUTING THE FLORIDA PORTS AND OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA PRESS WAS DOING THEIR JOB READING EVERYTHING HE SAID IT LIKE IT WAS THE GOSPEL. AND PUTTING THEM ON THE FRONT PAGE OF ALL OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND WE DID THE ANALYSIS AND FOUND OUT THE LONG BEACH PORT. BY ITSELF WAS MORE POWERFUL ECONOMICALLY THAN ALL THE FLOOR REPORTS COMBINED. SO WE PUT A LITTLE PRESS RELEASE OUT ON THAT GOT PICKED UP IN ALL THE FLORIDA NEWSPAPERS THAT RICK SCOTT SORT O MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN COMPARED OUR EDUCATIONAL STANDARDS WITH FLORIDA. WE CAME BACK TO GET CRITICIZED FOR NOT FOCUSING ON EDUCATION NINE I'M SEE RICK SCOTT AGAIN. INTERSTATE BUT THROUGHOUT THERE'S OVER A TWELVE STATES THAT HAVE STRATEGIC PLANS TO COME THE CALIFORNIA TAKE JOBS FROM US AND IT'S LISTED BY NAME. SO I HAVE BOTH AND I WON'T BORE YOU TO DEATH BUT. THIS IS WHAT WE GOT WE GO OUT NATIONALLY TO TWELVE U. S. MARKETS WE SEND OUT TWO THOUSAND NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS EVERY QUARTER TO THESE NATIONAL NETWORKS. AND IF YOU LISTEN TO WHAT PEOPLE SAY THERE SHOULD BE NINE PEOPLE LEFT IN CALIFORNIA. SO WE WERE NOT JUST THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE ECONOMY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND PRODUCTIVITY AND PROFITABILITY FOR INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA DWARFS TEXAS SO THAT'S JUST A PRODUCTIVITY CHART WE HAVE A. PROFITABILITY CHART THAT SHOWS THAT WE ARE THOUSANDS OF PERCENT MORE PROFITABLE FOR INDUSTRIES IN TEXAS SO YOU GET A ZERO CORPORATE TAX RATE AND TAXES. ARE IN BUSINESS TO MAKE MONEY OR IN BUSINESS TO AVOID TAXES SAID CALIFORNIA OFFERS A MUCH GREATER PROFITABILITY POTENTIAL. FOR FIFTY INDUSTRIES WE ANALYZED FIFTY INDUSTRIES THAT ARE ALL MORE PROFITABLE IN CALIFORNIA THEN AND TAXES. YET. I WILL I DON'T HAVE A REAL HAVE LIKE A SLIDE SHOW BUT A BRING UP THE NEXT SLIDE. THAT FRUSTRATES ME. SO THIS IS WHAT THEY THINK RIGHT. SO WE GO OUT NATIONALLY WE CAN BARELY GET A COMMUNICATION OUT. BECAUSE THIS IS ALL THERE HEARING RIGHT. NOW THE BEAUTY OF THIS SITE SELECTION MAGAZINE WERE DEMANDING A RETRACTION BECAUSE WE CUT THEM IN MATH THERE. SO SITE SELECTION MAGAZINE DID THE RANKING AND WE CUT THEM IN MATH FAIRS ON THE TAX POLICY. SO WE'VE BEEN RATED FIFTIETH AND TAXES BY SITE SELECTION MAGAZINE FOR YEARS AND THEY'VE BEEN USING THE WRONG DATA THEY ARE ALSO USING THE WRONG DATA ON POWER COSTS. SO WE'RE SITTING AROUND THINKING WOW YOU NO AS A STATE WE'RE LETTING YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA THE GOVERNOR OF UTAH THE GOVERNOR OF IOWA THE GOVERNOR TAXES. TRAVEL ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND SAY THESE THINGS ABOUT OUR STATE. AND MANY TIMES WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS NOT TRUE. AND YET WEARS A RESPONSE FOR US IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT'S ESTABLISHING CALIFORNIA'S BRAND SO STATEWIDE STRATEGY STARTS WITH ALL OF US UNDERSTANDING CALIFORNIA'S STRENGTHS AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT OUR STATE. THAT WE TALK ABOUT OUR STATE THAT REALLY DIFFERENTIATES US AND TELLS HER STORY. WE'RE PUTTING A CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE INDEX TOGETHER YOU'RE ADDING THINGS LIKE IMMIGRANTS PATENTS DIVERSITY VERY POWERFUL ECONOMIC DRIVERS WELL IF YOU CHANGE THE FORMULA ON HOW YOU MEASURE BUSINESS. VALUE YOU KNOW OUR MARKET DRAMATICALLY CHANGES IN FACT NY RANKS. CALIFORNIA'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON BUSINESS BETTER THAN TEXAS. AND BETTER THAN ARIZONA AND THAT'S ONE OF THE TOP FOUR PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD TO ME IS THAT. IN OUR OUR OUR OUR. OUR PEACHES AND PRESENTATIONS SO SIMPLY PUT YOU BUILDING A PLAN WILL ALLOW US ALL WORK WELL TOGETHER DO IT LESS AD HOC WILL BE ABLE TO SET A SMARTER. STRATEGIC DIRECTION BUT I REALLY WANT TO SEE US TAKE OUR VOICE BACK IN THE MARKETPLACE AND START THE CHALLENGE THESE STATES AND CHALLENGE THESE GOVERNORS THEY'RE COMING IN OUR STATE. GOING ON WALL STREET JOURNAL AND SAYING WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER CALIFORNIA AND ON AND ON AND ON. WHEN IN FACT THEY MAY NEVER BE ANOTHER CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY NEVER BEAT MIGHT NOT BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EVER BE A CALIFORNIA. SO. BETTER STATEWIDE PLAN BETTER STATEWIDE COORDINATION BETTER INFORMATION HELP THE SMALLER MARKETS GET TO THE MARKETPLACE AND ME AND THE GOBIZ DOES SLIGHT. SLIGHT USA'S A GREAT EXAMPLE GOBIZ DOING GOOD WORK BUT IT'S A SMALL SHOP YOU KNOW AND IN SOME PLACES. YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO OR THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DOING THIS WORK FOR OTHER STATES AND THEY CAN COVER A LOT OF GROUND IN THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES COMPLY AGAIN.

THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR QUIRK SILVA AYE. CHAIR QUIRK SILVA AYE. VICE CHAIR ALAN Y.. VICE CHAIR ELENA COOLEY AYE. COOLEY AYE. BERMAN. CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE. GARCIA. STEINORTH. STEINORTH I. OKAY THAT BILL IS ON CALL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALRIGHT. WE ARE GOING TO CALL UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER RATE IS TO PRESENT AB TWO NINE SEVEN FOUR LOCAL LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. TODAY AND PRESENTING A. B. TWO NINE SEVEN FOUR. BILL WHICH AIMS TO BETTER POWER SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES BY ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTING. OPPORTUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY WITH COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OWN. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE. LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE EFFORTS OF EMPLOYERS. TO ALIGN WITH PUBLIC CONTRACTING NEEDS IN A MANNER THAT WILL SUPPORT LOCAL WORKFORCE OPPORTUNITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITIES ACT. WHICH SET NEW STANDARDS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NATIONWIDE. THE ACT ALONG WITH STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT BOARD TO LEAD EFFORTS TO ENGAGE WITH A DIVERSE RANGE OF EMPLOYERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS. THESE GOALSINCLUDE PROMOTING BUSINESS REPRESENTATION ON BOARDS AND DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE LINKAGES WITH EMPLOYERS. SUPPORT THE UTILIZATION THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT CENTERS. PORTING ECONOMIC GROWTH. LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD'S ARE TRULY WORKING AT THE GROUND LEVEL AND HAVE AN INNATE UNDERSTANDING OF BUSINESS AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. DO TO THEIR LOCAL INTERACTION WITH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. REGULARLY STATE CONTRACTING CAN BE COMPLICATED. THAT CAN BE OUT COMPLICATED TO ACCESS FOR LOCAL EMPLOYERS AS A SICK TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO GROW AND DRIVE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEMANDS. THIS MAKES IT IMPERATIVE THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO INCLUDE ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE AND EMPOWER THEM WITH THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE TO THRIVE. I WOULD LIKE TO ONCE AGAIN THANK THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION FOR CONTINUING TO ENGAGE MY OFFICE ON THIS TOPIC. I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REACH THIS BILLS GOAL OF EMPOWERING LOCAL ECONOMIES. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FOUR IS SUPPORTED BY THE SAMBA DO YOU KNOW CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. AS WELL AS A ST BERNARD DO YOU KNOW AS WELL AS A SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA. HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA IS LAURIE KRAMMER. WELCOME THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS LAURIE CAMERON WITH SMALL BUSINESS CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ELEVEN CHAPTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. BOTH GROUPS PARTICIPATE ON THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN. A CONCERN AND ALSO OUT OF GREAT INTEREST THAT WE. NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES AND WORKING MORE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT PORTS IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES SO WE ARM GRATEFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I FELT THINKING. THANK YOU. OH OKAY. A WITH THAT DO WE HAVE ANY MEMBERS THAT HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AND. DO WE HAVE ANYBODY ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WELCOME. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS ERIC FLOORS AT THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE ASSOCIATION NOT IN SUPPORT NOT IN OPPOSITION JUST HAVE SOME. CONCERNS AND COMMENTS ABOUT THE BILL WE'D LIKE TO. MAKE KNOWN TODAY. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE DUPLICATIVE NATURE OF THIS WORK WITH RELATION TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MOSTLY THAT WE FEEL THIS MAY BE BETTER SERVED FIRST ALL. STATE SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTERS TO WORK ON. WE WANT TO REITERATE WE'RE NOT OPPOSED AYE WE CONTINUE TO WANT TO WORK WITH THE. MEMBER WE DO HOWEVER HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. FEELING THAT THEY WOULD BE HUGELY DUPLICATIVE TO CURRENTLY EXISTING STRUCTURES BOTH AT THE LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. A BOARD LEVEL AND IT COUNTY AGENCY LEVEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I WE ASK FOR. OPPOSITION AND YES WELCOME. AND CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR MICROENTERPRISE OPPORTUNITY HOW DEEP YOU CAN SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND WE GET A MOTION TO MOVE IN A SECOND AND I HAVE A JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON ON THIS. LEGISLATION. YOU KNOW AS A TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN IS MANY. INDIVIDUALS NEED CERTAIN TYPES OF PRESENTATIONS IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH A PROCESS AND SOMETIMES UP ONE A GROUP MAY PRESENT SOMETHING IN ONE WAY ANOTHER. A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I'VE SEEN THAT THE MORE EXPLICIT WE CAN BE. THE MORE. FORTHCOMING ABOUT WHAT IS THE PROCESS THEN WE CAN START TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUITY. AND DELIVERING THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE A WHETHER IT BE UNDER. STATE CONTRACTS WHETHER IT BE I JUST ACCESSING AND I KNOW THAT IN MANY OF OUR REGIONS ACCESS SEEMS TO BE A AN ISSUE WE HAVE A WHOLE NOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ISN'T THIS ONE IN ONE OF. THE MANY DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THAT LEGISLATION. IS WHEN PEOPLE I DON'T GO THROUGH A PROCESS THE CORRECT WAY A LOT OF TIMES THERE A PACKAGE OF INFORMATION GETS STUCK AND LATER ON THEY FIND OUT OKAY WE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTANDS THAT. AND SOMEBODY WHO'S UP BEEN DOING IT MANY MANY TIMES MAYBE THEY'RE A REGULAR IF YOU WANT TO SAY THAT AT AXIS SEE. STATE FUNDS THEY ZIP THROUGH IT AND. THIS THIS IS ALL OVER THE BOARD WHETHER IT BE APPLYING FOR GRANTS WERE YOU KNOW WITH THE MORE. OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS THE BETTER YOU GET BUT WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THE NEWCOMERS AND AND SMALL BUSINESSES EVEN TWO TO THREE AND THEY WANT TO LOOK AT DO THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO COMPETE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE UP THE THE TEAM PUT TOGETHER THAT THAT HAS THE FULL. ABED KIND OF WORKFORCE HOURS THAT THEY NEED TO SPEND ON THIS SO I SEE THIS AS A WAY TO KIND OF LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD IN MAKING SURE THAT. THAT. WHETHER IT'S THREE EMPLOYEES OR MAJOR. GROUP THAT THEY ALL CAN MAKE SURE THEY CAN ACCESS WHAT WE PROVIDE THROUGH THE STATE SO WITHOUT I DO SUPPORT THE BILL WE HAVE A MOTION A SECOND. MISTER SECRETARY. ITEM NUMBER FIVE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. CHAIR QUIRK SILVA. CHAIR QUIRK SILVA AYE. VICE CHAIR ALAN. VICE CHAIR ALLEN AYE. COOLEY. COOLEY AYE BERMAN. CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE. GARCIA. STEINORTH. STEINORTH I. OKAY THIS BILL GOING CALL THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAY S. AND TEAM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALRIGHT SO I THINK I AM GOING TO BE THE LAST PRESENTER AND A SOME VICE CHAIR. MISTER ALLEN YOU'RE GONNA BE. HEADING THIS UP. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. RIGHT HERE. FULLER DIDN. GOOD GOOD. THANKS. WHERE IS OUR ITEM NUMBER? I KNOW COOPER AFFECT IT. I LOVE IT. OKAY NEXT UP IS I AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN. LIKE TO PRESENT. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. AND DATA I WANT TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES. AMENDMENTS AND ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE WE HAVE SIX OF SIX OF THOSE AN WITH THIS DOES IS ACTUALLY INTEGRATES SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE WITH THE THE STATE'S EXISTING DISASTER. UP PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES. UNFORTUNATELY THIS LAST YEAR WE SAW A SEASON IN CALIFORNIA OF ON PRESIDENT. NOT ONLY FIRES BUT FLOODS AND. EVERYTHING ELSE IN BETWEEN AND THIS REALLY BROUGHT FOR FORWARD. HOW'RE WE COORDINATING WHO IS RESPONSIBLE AFTER THESE EVENTS A QUIRK OCCUR AND IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS. OWNER HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO NAVIGATE WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER EVERYTHING IS LOST WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO GO TO WE KNOW. IF IT'S AN HOMEOWNER OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO UP PERHAPS THEIR INSURANCE CARRIER BUT IF YOU'RE A BUSINESS YOU MAY NOT HAVE ALL OF THOSE. THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IN PLACE AND THEY NEED AN ADVOCATE SO THIS WOULD CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE ADVERT KIT WITHIN THE SMALL BUSINESS PROCUREMENT AND REGULATORY ASSISTANT ACTIVITIES. I AM ALSO JOINTLY AUSTRIAN THIS BILL WITH THE SUDDENLY MEMBER LOW MOAN WHO SOME OF YOU WILL REMEMBER WHAT THAT MIGHT TO SETO. FLOODS IT WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN MUCH OF THIS DISCUSSION AND ACTIVITY WITHIN HER COMMUNITY AYE AND WE ALSO I'VE ASKED. JESSE TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE TO JOIN US BUT. HE'S NOT HERE TODAY SO OF BUT IT IT'S AS SIMPLE BUT NEEDED AND SO I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. BILLS MOVE BILLS NEWMAN SECONDED ARE THERE ARE AMENDMENTS AND YOU'VE ACCEPTED ALL THE MEMBERS CORRECT YES ARISE ANYONE ELSE WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES AGAINST. OKAY THE BILLS AND MOVED INSIDE AND OUT OF SECTORS LIKE CALLED WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS AN EXCELLENT. BILL. YOU KNOW THE SMALL BUSINESS ISSUES AND DISASTERS ARE ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE. BASIC ISSUES OF HOW DOES DOES THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON HAVE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE TO THE KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CLAIM. THERE'S THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES THAT ARISE. BUT THEN IT'S LIKE IT'S JUST MIND BLOWING THE TYPES OF ISSUES COME THAT COME UP. AFTER. AFTER THE. DOWNTOWN MALL IN SANTA CRUZ FELL DOWN THE LOWER PRESSURE EARTHQUAKE. WE HAD CENTURY OLD BUILDINGS THAT COLLAPSED. ONE OF THE ISSUES AROSE A SMALL BUSINESSES. GOT BLINDSIDED WITH WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT. DOWN IN THE MUD OF THEIR FOUNDATIONS NOW EXPOSED TO LIGHT AND WATER. AFTER CENTURIES BEING HIDDEN AWAY. THAT SOME PLANTS UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA MIGHT. BLOOM. AND COMPLICATE REBUILDING. SO THERE'S JUST IT'S ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE HOW DISASTERS CAN SORT OF RESET THE TABLE WREAK. BRING COMPLICATION HOW YOU RECOVER. ALL ALL THE HOOPS YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE TEMPORARY FACILITIES AS WAS DONE FOR ABOUT A YEAR WITH THE PACIFIC GARDEN ALL THAT'S THE SANTA CRUZ THING. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL A. FOR THE ECONOMIC VITALITY IS COMMITTEES WHICH ARE OF COURSE ESSENTIAL TO HOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR. VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE PUZZLE SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS GREAT GREAT IDEA. THANK YOU ANY OTHER GUY COME THROUGH COMMITTEE MEMBERS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. BY YES YES I I A. AS WAS NOTED THIS ISN'T A GIANT BILL IN THE SCHEME OF CALIFORNIA BUT OUT WHEN WE CAN HELP SOMEBODY WHO IS SET UP AND TAKEN THE RISK THEMSELVES TO OPEN A BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND DISASTER STRIKES WE NEED TO HAVE SOMEBODY THEY CAN GO TO.
