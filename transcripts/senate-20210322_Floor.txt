THE CARBON NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED EXISTING DISPARITIES IN CARE BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL RESIDENTS OF THE OF OUR STATE BUT THESE DISPARITIES EXISTED LONG BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN SOME OF THIS IS DUE TO WHAT INCENTIVIZE PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE WHERE THEY ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO BUT IN MY MIND IT IS DUE TO A LACK OF STRONG OVERSIGHT BY THE BOARD AND DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS HEALTHCARE CONSUMERS IN MY DISTRICT HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CARE THEY DESERVE I AM CONCERNED THAT MEMBERS OF THE BOARD HAVE NOT PROPERLY MAINTAINED OBJECTIVELY AND COULD DO BETTER NOT HOLDING THE BOARD'S MISSION OF PROTECTING PATIENTS. FOR THIS REASON I CANNOT VOTE TO APPROVE DR TO NON OF ITS APPOINTMENT. SENATE ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK IS MOST OF YOU ON THE FLOOR NO WE HAD A RATHER DIFFICULT TO SUNSET REVIEW OVERSIGHT HEARING ON FRIDAY LASTED FIVE HOURS ACTUALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDICAL BOARD FURTHER WORSENING WHAT I WOULD CALL INSTITUTIONAL OR SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THAT REALLY REQUIRES SOME FURTHER EXPLANATION HAVING TO DO WITH. THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS THAT THE BOARD IMPLIES TRANSPARENCY- PERHAPS OF SOME OF THE DECISIONS AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE RATIONALE FOR THE DECISIONS- BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE AND NO TESTIMONY. OF THE THAT WAS A DUES TO DURING THE HEARING TO POINT ANY MISCONDUCT ON THE PART OF ANY BOARD MEMBERS. TO INDICATE ANY ON FITNESS OR LACK OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR SERVICE. I FOR ONE KNOW HAVE KNOWN A- DR DEV GENITIVE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. OF LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO I'M CERTAINLY WELL AWARE OF HIS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY I'M PARTICULARLY ACUTELY AWARE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS IN WHAT IS AN UNDER SERVED THERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS SAN BERNADINO AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES.

DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME HERE. WORRYING ABOUT IN TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR. AGAIN I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE BOARDS IN PARTICULAR BOARD SUCH AS THE MEDICAL BOARD. WE ASK INDIVIDUALS PROFESSIONALS WE AS PHYSICIANS PSYCHOLOGISTS. LAWYERS REALTORS INDIVIDUALS FROM VARIOUS WALKS OF LIFE WHO TYPICALLY ARE VERY VERY. SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES AND PROFESSIONS. TO COME FORWARD TO ATTEND BOARD MEETINGS. TO LISTEN THE TO MAKE VERY VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS AS VOLUNTEERS FOR WHICH WE COMPENSATE THEM AT THE EXTRAORDINARY RATE OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY. PER DIEM AND I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND AS THEY DO THAT BY THE WAY. THEY SUBJECT THEMSELVES OFTEN. DECEMBER DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS AS WE HAD ON FRIDAY WITH SOME OF THEM AND TO SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT ABUSE THE SAME SORT OF ABUSE THAT WE SOMETIMES FACE.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SEVENTEEN BY SENATOR LEYVA RELATIVE TO RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CENTER LEYVA THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION SEVENTEEN RECOGNIZING MARCH TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THE UNITED NATIONS ALSO SERVES THAT DATE WITH THE SIMILAR RECOGNITION THE DAY IS OBSERVED ANNUALLY ON THE DAY THE POLICE IN SHARPEVILLE SOUTH AFRICA. OPENED FIRE AND KILLED SIXTY NINE PEOPLE AT A PEACEFUL DEMONSTRATION AGAINST APARTHEID IN NINETEEN SIXTY MEMBERS AS WE ALL KNOW THE STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. I WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OVER A HALF CENTURY AFTER MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WAS ASSASSINATED AMERICA WILL BE IN A BETTER PLACE OF EQUALITY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR ALL PEOPLE. THE RECENT PROTESTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND EVEN COME EVEN COMMENTS AND ACTIONS FROM SOME FEDERAL LEADERS IN RECENT YEARS OR CLEAR REMINDER THAT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN VARIOUS FORMS IS A REALITY TO THIS DAY SO LET US COME TOGETHER AS AMERICANS AND LOVE AND TREAT ONE ANOTHER-WITH EVERY BIT OF RESPECT THAT EVERY PERSON DESERVES I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE ON S. C. R. SEVENTEEN THANK YOU. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MADAM FOR- SENATOR I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR. VESSEY ARE SEVENTEEN- I THINK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM CHINO FOR BRING THIS FORWARD AS- PROUD TO AUTHOR AND CHAIR OF THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS. CERTAINLY HONOR TO RECOGNIZE THE INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR LIMITATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. I POINT OUT THAT- CERTAINLY WE HAVE OUR CHALLENGES HERE BUT THIS IS- MANY TIMES- THAT OUR COUNTRY IS A LEADER AROUND THE WORLD UNFORTUNATELY WE ALSO- WHAT THERE WE ALSO FOUGHT SOME OUR WE ALSO CAN BE IMPLICIT IN SOME OF THE- SERVE RACIAL STEREOTYPES- PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW IN SOUTH ASIA WE TALK ABOUT WHITENING CREAMS- NOW SOME OF THIS MADE AS A LEGACY OF COLONIALISM OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AS WELL BUT CERTAINLY HERE EVEN HERE IN OUR COUNTRY I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT AND TWENTY NINETEEN I HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE AS CHAIR OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON API FAIR STRAIGHT WILL RAISE AWARENESS ON THE MODEL MINORITY MYTHS AND THE BEARS THAT ATI'S FACE. RE REACHING LEADERSHIP ROLES IN PROFESSIONAL WORKPLACE OFTEN TIMES- THE PEOPLE LOOK AT ASIAN AMERICANS IS BEING QUOTE THE- ASIAN HAVING THE ASIAN ADVANTAGE- BUT- FOR SOME OF OUR SUB GROUPS BUT THESE ARE RACIALIZED AND OVERSIMPLIFY TREATMENTS STATEMENTS THAT MASK THE COMPLEXITY DIVERSITY TO EXISTING EACH RACIAL POPULATION IN FACT ET I COMMUNITY IS NOT HOMOGENEOUS IN FACT- DATA DISAGGREGATION REVEALS ATKINS THE SOBERING REALITY THAT EACH GROUP HAS VARIOUS LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT INCOME AND IMMIGRATION HISTORY HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH THE API CAN USE OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RACE EDUCATION EQUITY LEADERSHIP ADVANCEMENT HEALTH DISPARITIES. FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY SEVENTEEN A STUDY CO AUTHORED BY CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT JUSTICE GOODWIN LIU SHOW THAT ASIAN AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN THIRTY LAW SCHOOLS SO THAT'S THE PART ONE GOES NAY BUT YET HAS THE HIGHEST ATTRITION RATES IN THE LOWEST RACIAL PARTNERS TO ASSOCIATES AMONG ALL RACIAL GROUPS EFFECT OR UNDER REPRESENTED IN THAT COURTS AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE AN API DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WHO IS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVEN AS WE'RE FACING AT INCREASES AND HATE AGAINST ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS RESPECT HEALTH DISPARITIES RECENT NEWS ARTICLES HAVE SHOWN THAT COVERED NINETEEN HAS IMPACTED THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY SEVERELY IS THE RATE AMONG NEEDLEPOINT PACIFIC ISLANDER PRESENTS. THE SEGMENT CAME LAST YEAR CAME TO FORT PERCENT NEARLY TWICE SIZE. THE AB OF. COUNTRY AVERAGE OF TWO ONE FOR AND ACTUAL HIGHER THAN OTHER RAY- SO SINCE THE START OF A PANDEMIC OUR COMMUNION ONLY FACED SEVERITIES CAUSED BY SYSTEMIC RACISM BUT ALSO HAS BEEN USED AS A SCAPEGOAT FOR THE PANDEMIC. THE TO RISE SHARP ANTI ASIAN VIOLENCE. THIS YEAR SEVENTEEN COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME REMINDERS THAT THE REAL PLAGUE IN OUR SOCIETY IS RACISM. THAT WE MUST COME TOGETHER TO AND THIS IS A PLAGUE THAT NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE FACTS ARE CUT. COUNTRY AS WELL AS AROUND THE WORLD I STATE EXACTLY ASKING SUPPORT S. C. R. SEVENTEEN THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER. Q- MADAM PRESIDENTMEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR SEVENTEEN- BOTH IN ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS BUT ALSO AS A- INDIVIDUAL AND I APPRECIATE- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO BRING THIS FORWARD I READ OVER- OUR HOLIDAY BREAK THE BOOK BY ISABEL WILKERSON CALLED CAST AND EVEN EVEN THOUGH MANY OF US WHO HAVE TRIED TO. IMPROVE OUR EDUCATION IN TERMS OF THE JUST POLICIES INST IN OUR WHAT WE CALL IMPLICIT BIAS VARIOUS THINGS WITHIN OUR CULTURE OUR GOVERNMENT OUR STRUCTURES IT'S I OPENING BOOKS LIKE CAST TO LEARN FOR EXAMPLE AND I'M SURE MANY ON THE FLOOR PROBABLY KNEW THIS WELL BUT TO LEARN FOR EXAMPLE THAT HITLER AND THE **** USED THE US'S RACIST RULES AND LAWS TO PATTERN THEIR OWN- BASICALLY THEIR OWN. OUR RULES AND OUR PROGRAMS AGAINST JEWS GYPSIES AND OTHERS FOUND OUT OF COURSE IN SOUTH AFRICA APARTHEID TOOK MUCH OF ITS IN- INSPIRATION OR INSIGHT FROM OUR- HOW WE TREATED OUR NATIVE AMERICANS AND HOW WE CREATED- RESERVATIONS- LAST NIGHT I WATCHED SIXTY MINUTES. AND THERE WAS A FASCINATING- EXPOSE ON THE RACISM IN US MILITARY AND THE NEW HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE- LLOYD AUSTIN BIDEN'S APPOINTEE WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN AND A GENERAL FROM THE AIRFORCE TALKED ABOUT. HOW IN THEIR FORTY YEARS IN THE MILITARY. THE UNFORTUNATELY VERY LITTLE HAS CHANGED AND THE GENERAL FUND AIRFORCE DESCRIBED HOW WHEN HE FIRST WHEN HE BECAME A PILOT AIR FORCE PILOT. THERE WERE 2% OF THE PILOTS THAT WERE BLACK AND TODAY THERE ARE STILL WHO ARE BLACK- SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND I BRING IT UP EVEN THOUGH WE'RE THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL. A RESOLUTION AROUND INTERNATIONAL RACISM BECAUSE OF UNFORTUNATELY HOW SO MANY OF OUR POLICIES OUR COUNTRY'S POLICIES IN EFFECT. INSPIRED OR WERE THE WERE THE MODELTO PATTERN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES VERY RACIST POLICIES SO APPRECIATE THE RESOLUTION AND I STAND IN SUPPORT. SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TO RISE- SECURED THE LEGISLATIVE WHAT PARKER'S IN CALL AUTHORED SCR SEVENTEEN OFFERING MY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AGAIN OUR COLLEAGUE FROM CHINO FOR BRINGING THIS FOR. BUT IN SOME WAYS MEMBERS WERE HYPOCRITES. WE'RE HYPOCRITES WHEN WE ADVOCATE FOR INTERNATIONAL ENDING A RACISM WHEN WE FAIL TO ADDRESS IT RIGHT HERE IN OUR OWN BACKYARD CALIFORNIA HAS AN EXTENSIVE HISTORY OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION THE DATES BACK TO THE FOUNDING. AND CONTINUES TODAY TO BE TOLD AMERICA'S PRIDE THE MOST RACIST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET. RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS PART OF OUR DNA. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES RAISING RACES OWNING LAWS WERE USING SAN FRANCISCO TO EXCLUDE CHINESE FAMILIES FROM RESIDING IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITY. SINGLE FAMILY ZONING WAS NEVER ABOUT HOUSING CONFORMITY. IT WAS ABOUT RACIAL EXCLUSION AND LACK OF DIVERSITY IN NEIGHBORHOODS. ZOOT SUIT RIOTS AND WHAT TRIED TO LOS ANGELES WHERE THE RESULTS OF BLATANT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND SEGREGATION AGAINST LATINOS AFRICAN AMERICANS AND OTHER MINORITIES. MINORITIES IN ITS STATE HAVE HAD TO RECKON WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION FOR GENERATIONS. WE SEE THOSE CONSEQUENCES AND ARE OVER POLICING AND KILLING OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS ON A DAILY BASIS WE SEE IT IN THE CANNABIS MARKET OR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FACE BARRIERS OF ENTRY DESPITE BEING MOST HARMED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS WE SEE IT IN THE WORKPLACE WORST RACIAL DISCRIMINATION LAWSUITS RUN RAMPANT. WE SEE IT EVEN IN THIS BUILDING. WE SIT IN OUR SCHOOLS WE SEE IT WITH OUR YOUNG STUDENTS WHO ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CONTINUE TO BE RACIALLY SEGREGATED. AND ARE UNDER EDUCATED EVEN WHEN THEY T. AND BETTER SCHOOLS AND HAVE STATED WE SAID IN OUR MILITARY. OR AFRICAN AMERICANS MAKE UP ONLY 17% OF THE MILITARY BUT 57% OF INVOLUNTARY DISCHARGES TO THIS DAY. OF ALL THESE CONSEQUENCES. BUT ALL THESE CONSEQUENCES ONLY DOES. BOOKSTORE ALL IT ONLY EXACERBATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. WE NOW KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE OF COLOR WERE MORE LIKELY TO GET COLD BUT MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER SERIOUS SYMPTOMS AND MORE LIKELY TO DIE OF COVERT. AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR VACCINES THIS IS PRIORITIES DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. OR OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT OVER CENTURIES OF DISCRIMINATION AND LAW AND POLICY. THERE IS MUCH WORK TO BE NOT ONLY IN AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AS WELL AS OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS TIME. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THE NATION TO STOP TALKING ABOUT RACIAL EQUALITY AND START BEING ANTI RACES PERMISSION AGREES. OUR MISSION CREDIT. IT'S HARD IT'S A HARD LIFE ON EASY STREET. THIS WHITE IT FENCES BARS YOUR I CAN SEE IF YOU THINK WE LIVE IN THE LAND OF FREE. YOU TRY BEING BLACK LIKE ME. ALL SUNDAY WILL ALL BE FREE AND I'M PROUD TO BE BLACK LIKE ME I'M PROUD TO BE BLACK LIKE ME THOSE ARE LYRICS FROM BLACK LIKE ME FROM. MICKEY GUYTON A PHENOMENAL COUNTRY SINGER PHENOMENAL ARTIST IN AN OVER ALL RIGHT AND SHE SPEAKS TO THE DISCRIMINATION THAT SHE FACES. TO THIS DAY EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTED RAMIE LAST WEEK THE DISCRIMINATION OF ANY COUNTRY. S. RIVAL.

SENATE BILL THREE ELEVEN BY SENATOR HUESO AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SENATOR WAIT SO THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING SP THREE ELEVEN THE COMPASSIONATE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CANNABIS ACT OR ALSO KNOWN AS RYAN'S LAW. THIS BILL IS NAMED AFTER RYAN BARTEL A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AND U. S. COAST GUARD VETERAN WHO SADLY PASSED AWAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AFTER A BRIEF BUT VERY BRAVE BATTLE WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. RYAN'S LAW WOULD REQUIRE THAT HOSPITALS AND CERTAIN TYPES OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN THE STATE. ALLOW A TERMINALLY ILL PATIENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR TREATMENT AND OR PAIN RELEASED. LEAVE A CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ALLOWING THE USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA NOW FOR MANY YEARS YET SOMEBODY- SEEKING TO USE- OF CANNABIS FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT WITHIN A HOSPITAL IS CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED IN THAT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THIS BILL VERY HARD ALSO AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL KNOWING THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN. CHANGES COMING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT ALSO MAKE THIS BILL.

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETEEN BY SENATOR LEYVA RELATIVE TO EQUAL PAY DAY. CENTER LEYVA THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE AND I HAVE A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS RESOLUTION I LOVE THAT I CAN RISE AND SPEAK ABOUT IT BUT I HATE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT J. EQUITY FOR WOMEN. SO I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NINETEEN WHICH PROCLAIMS WEDNESDAY MARCH TWENTY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS EQUAL PAY DAY IN RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE GENDER PAY GAP IN EARNINGS BY WOMEN'S MARCH TWENTY FOURTH MARKS HOW FAR INTO THE YEAR THE NEXT YEAR WOMEN HAVE TO WORK TO EARN AS MUCH AS THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS DID THE PRIOR YEAR. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WOMEN WORKING FULL TIME AND YEAR ROUND ARE PAID EIGHTY TWO CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID TO A MAN WHO WORKS FULL TIME AND YEAR ROUND SADLY EQUAL PAY DAY IS ONLY WORSE FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. BLACK WOMEN EARNING SIXTY THREE CENTS TO THE DOLLAR MOST WORK UNTIL AUGUST THIRD. AIRCON WOMEN EARNING SIXTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR MUST WORK UNTIL SEPTEMBER EIGHT. AND LATINA WOMEN EARNING FIFTY FIVE CENTS TO THE DOLLAR MUST WORK UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST. TO BE PAID WHAT A MAN WAS PAID THE YEAR PRIOR. WELL EQUAL PAY DAY FOR API WOMEN IS EARLIER IN THE YEAR ON MARCH FIFTH THEY ALSO SUFFER A NOTABLE PAY GAP. AAPI WOMEN CAN EARN AS LITTLE AS FIFTY TWO CENTS. AS BURMESE WOMEN DUE TO EIGHTY FIVE CENTS OVERALL FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID TO MEN. WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE HOW THE PAY GENDER GAP HAS BEEN FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY THE OVERALL GREATER IMPACT OF COVERED NINETEEN. THIS IS HAD ON WOMEN AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON WOMEN WILL ALSO LIKELY HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON ON GOING ON THE ONGOING WAGE GAP IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE NATION MEMBERS ON AVERAGE WOMEN EMPLOYED FULL TIME IN THE UNITED STATES WAS A COMBINED TOTAL OF MORE THAN. NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR DUE TO THE WAGE GAP THAT'S JUST AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THESE WERE LOST WAGES MEAN THAT WOMEN IN THEIR FAMILIES HAVE LESS MONEY TO SUPPORT THEMSELVES SAVE AND INVEST FOR THE FUTURE AND SPENT ON GOODS AND SERVICES. THE GENDER GAP IS A MEASURE OF JUST HOW FAR NATION STILL HAS TO GO TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN CAN PARTICIPATE FULLY. AND EQUALLY IN OUR ECONOMY MEMBERS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I RISE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR TWO S. C. R. NINETEEN I HAVE WTNESSED THE STARK DISPARITIES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL IT TOOK TO THE WORKPLACE AND WAGES IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WOMEN CONTINUE TO FACE A GAP EARNINGS SIMPLY AND SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THEIR GENDER STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS WIDENED THIS GAP AND HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE WOMEN'S THAT WOMEN'S JOBS OR ONE POINT EIGHT TIMES MORE VULNERABLE TO AND THESE TYPE OF CRISES THAT MEN'S JOBS. FURTHER WOMEN ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO COVER NINETEEN RELATED ECONOMIC A FAX BECAUSE OF EXISTING GENDER INEQUALITIES I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAIL DISPARITIES AS A GREAT SENATOR FROM HINO HIGHLIGHTED EACH CATEGORY BUT WHEN WOMEN ARE COMPENSATED. PROPERLY WE ALL WIN IN CALIFORNIA. GREATER GENDER EQUALITY IS GOOD FOR THE STATE IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT'S GOOD FOR OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU. SENATOR PENN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS- I TOO WANT TO STAND AS STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR NINETEEN AND- THANK CENTER- BECAUSE ENTER FROM CHINO FOR BEING THIS FORD IS CHAIR OF THE PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- BUT MAKE NOTE THAT THE AVERAGE. API WOMAN HAS TO WORK AN ADDITIONAL THREE MONTHS TO MAKE SAME PAYS WHAT WHITE MEN EARNED A TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE API WOMEN ARE TYPICALLY TAKE PAID JUST 85% CENTS PER DOLLAR IS I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED BY THE AUTHOR. BUT THIS IS NOT THE FULL STORY AND IN FACT- THIS AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AGGREGATING THE DATA AND ALSO THE MODEL MINORITY MYTH BECAUSE- OUR COMMUTES ARE DIVERSE AND EACH API COMMUNITY IS AFFECTED DIFFERENTLY. IT MEANS WOMEN EARN AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY SEVEN CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR PAID TO WHITE NON HISPANIC MALE HAWAIIAN LAOTIAN WOMEN EARN AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY TWO DAYS AND SIXTY ONE CENTS CAMBODIAN MOM SAMOAN AND TONGAN WOMEN EARN AN AVERAGE OF SIXTY CENTS. THE PARTY WOMEN EARN AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY FOUR CENTS AND pWOMEN EARN AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY TWO CENTS PER DOLLAR. THAT A NON HISPANIC WHITE MALE EARNS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I THINK IT IS- ALSO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM CHINO SAID IT'S A SERVICE. WHEN THIS RESOLUTION COMES UP- WE BTH NEED TO BRING IT OUT AND ALSO WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO. BECAUSE A FORTUNE MEANS THE PROBLEM STILL CONTINUES TO EXIST- I RESPECTFULLY ASKS FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION THE HOPES THAT SOME DAY. WE WILL NO LONGER NEED TO DO THIS RESOLUTION AND THAT ALL WOMEN. ARE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR A RACER NEXT BUSINESS CITY HAVE- EQUAL PAY TO- ALL MEN. INCLUDING QUITE NOW HISPANIC. YEAH THANK YOU. SENATOR RAZA. THANK OU MADAM CHAIR AND I TO THANK THE AUTHOR OUR SENATOR FROM CHINO FOR RAISING THE ISSUE OF GENDER GAP IN OUR EARNINGS BY WOMEN AND AS SHE SAID FOR LATINAS EQUAL PAY DAY DOESN'T COME UNTIL OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO ON THAT DAY WE CELEBRATE OUR WE CRY I AM NOT QUITE SURE. BUT THE COVER NINETEEN HAD THAT MAKE HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY FELT BY. OUR COMMUNITIES LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE HARDEST HIT LATINOS ARE HEAVILY REPRESENTED IN THE INDUSTRIES IMPACTED BY COLBERT NINETEEN. MAKES A MORE VULNERABLE JOB LOSS WAGE THEFT AND INEQUITIES IN PAY SO IT ISN'T JUST A- YOU KNOW. OUR LADY HOW MUCH DO YOU GET HOW MUCH DOES OFMALE COUNTERPART GET IT'S ACTUALLY INSTITUTIONS WITH THE SYSTEMS. LATINOS ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TAB PAID SICK DAYS. THE OPTION OF WORKING FROM HOME. MAKES THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE CONTENT TO CONTRACTING THE VIRUS AT WORK AND MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN. ECONOMIC AND HEALTH SECURITY. LATINOS HAVE HAD LOWER PREPEND THAT MAKE WAGES INCOME WEALTH AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON OBVIOUSLY FOR DECADES OF HAVING BEEN OVER UNDERPAID AND OVERLOOKED. I WOULD URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT OUR UNSEEN LATINOS INITIATIVE TO ENSURE THE LATINO WOMEN ARE PART OF AN EQUITABLE ECONOMIC RECOVERY WE SHOULD NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO OBSERVE THE INJUSTICE OF AN EQUAL PAY DAY OR LATINA EQUAL PAY DAY THANK YOU. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU IN A PRESIDENT I RISE AS OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN SUPPORT OF YEAR NINETEEN OUR INABILITY TO PAY WOMEN AT THE SAME RATE AS THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS REPRESENTS A CONTINUED MORAL FAILURE OF OUR SOCIETY OUR JEWISH TRADITION RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF FAIR WAGES ARE WRITTEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO THE TORAH COMMANDS US QUOTE YOU SHALL NOT DEFRAUD YOUR NEIGHBOR YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ROBBRY THE WAGES OF THE LABORERS ARE NOT REMAIN WITH YOU UNTIL MORNING AND QUOTE. ANOTHER CENTRAL JEWISH TEXTS THE TALMUD GOES EVEN FURTHER SAYING QUOTE ONE WHO UPHOLDS THE WAGES OF A HIRED LABOR IT IS THOUGH THEY TAKE THEIR SOUL FROM THEM AND QUOTE UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE CLEAR ORDERS FROM OUR TRADITION THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IS NOT IMMUNE TO GENDER DISPARITIES THAT AMERICAN JEWISH INSTITUTIONS THE GENDER PAY GAP IS ABOUT THE SAME AS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. ON THE TWENTY NINTH HIGHEST PAID JEWISH PROFESSIONALS ARE ALL MEN AND AS EVIDENCED BY THE MAKE UP OF OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS WE STILL HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO UPLIFT JEWISH WOMEN WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND BEYOND IN RECENT YEARS POSITIVE PROGRAMS LIKE THE REFORM MOVEMENT'S PAY EQUITY INITIATIVE HAVE SERVICE TO ADDRESS AND TACKLE THE GENDER WAGE GAP FOR PROFESSIONALS WHO SERVE AND THEIR INSTITUTIONS. BUT WE STILL HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE GENDER EQUITY INSTEAD OF JUST STUDYING AT- AND TO RID OUR SOCIETY OF SYSTEMIC GENDER DISCRIMINATION WE MUST TACKLE THIS ISSUE AT A STRUCTURAL LEVEL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I WILL. SENATOR CAMEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I RIDE RIDES IN STRONG SUPPORT FOR S. C. R. NINETEEN RELATIVE TO EQUAL PAY DAY YOU KNOW W ALL KNOW THAT WOMEN DON'T GET PAID THEY'RE WORTH AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW THAT BY NOW JUST ASK A WOMAN AND SHE WILL TELL YOU. OVER FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FEDERAL EQUAL PAY ACT OF ALL WOMEN ESPECIALLY MINORITY WOMEN. CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ON EQUAL PAY. FOR DECADES BLACK WOMEN HAVE CREATED SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH EDUCATION ENTREPRENEURSHIP POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. AND IMPROVING OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE THE ULTIMATE. HUSTLERS WHEN IT COMES TO HUSTLING FOR CHILD CARE SHELTER SAFETY EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION FOR OUR BABIES AND DIGNITY AND WE ARE STILL TRYING TO FIND SOME EQUITY. IT TAKES THE TYPICAL BLACK WOMAN NINETEEN MONTHS TO BE PAID WHAT THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN TAKES HOME IN TWELVE. PARENTAL STATUS CAN ALSO HAVE A GREAT IMPACT ON THE WAGE GAP BLACK MOTHERS MAKE FIFTY CENTS TO EVERY DOLLAR A WHITE FATHER MAKES. AND I BET WE ARE DOING TWICE AS MUCH WORK. THIS ISSUE HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE WITH THE INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES WOMEN HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH CARING FOR THEIR HOUSEHOLDS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THE WELLBEING OF BLACK WOMEN IS CRITICAL TO THEIR FAMILIES TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND TO OUR COUNTRY AS A WHOLE WE MUST ALL CONTINUE TO RAISE AWARENESS ON THE ISSUE OF PAY EQUITY FOR WOME. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. SENATOR BAKER. THE SUPPORT OF S. C. R. NINETEEN R. TWENTY TO ADD AS OUR VERY OWN FORMER CENTER KAMEL HARRIS NO VICE PRESIDENT SAID DURING HER PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WE NEED TO CHANGE THE BURDEN OF PROOF FROM WOMEN TO HAVING PROVED THAT PAYS MONEY GO TO COMPANIES TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE PAYING.

SENATOR LEYVA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND MUCH APPRECIATED I JUST ASK YOU TO IMAGINE HOW MANY WOMEN WOULDN'T STAY IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS IF THEY HAD EQUAL PAY SO MANY WOMEN STAND THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SUPPORT THEMSELVES IMAGINE IN A TWO PARENT HOUSEHOLD IF BOTH PARENTS WERE PAID EQUALLY HOW MUCH BETTER OFF THOSE CHILDREN WOULD BE BUT I BRING YOU HOPE TODAY. AS WE ALL SIT HERE IS LEGISLATORS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEGISLATE IF COMPANIES WON'T DO THE RIGHT THING CORPORATIONS WON'T DO THE RIGHT THING WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE VOTE.
