00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.749
HOW WE ARE PULLING PEOPLE OUT

00:28:37.816 --> 00:28:39.617
OF HOMELESSNESS AND THE REASON

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:41.853
WHY I AM ASKING THE QUESTION IS

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.657
BECAUSE A LOS ANGELES COUNTY-

00:28:45.723 --> 00:28:47.425
52% OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:50.895

00:28:50.962 --> 00:28:52.664

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.300
OUR ANGLO HOMELESS POPULATION

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:58.536
HAS DECREASED BY 7% AND YET

00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:00.205

PROVIDED TO WHITE ANGELENOS AND

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:15.453
SO AS WE CONTINUE TO INFUSE

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.423
GREATER DOLLARS INTO ATTACKING

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.958

00:29:20.024 --> 00:29:21.493

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.927

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:51.662
NUMBER OF YEARS AND I AND MY

THE FIRST STEPS TO GETTING US

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.971

UP TO THIS POINT. IT'S NOT

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:19.657

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.631
RETAINED AS AFFORDABLE UNITS

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.467
INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT IF THE

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:32.103
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DECIDES THAT

00:39:32.169 --> 00:39:33.204
THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE AWAY FROM

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.439
USING THOSE UNITS THAT. THEY

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:36.640
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE NON

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.242
PROFITS TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE I

00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:39.477
JUST I FEEL VERY STRONGLY WE

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.978
NEED TO START PROTECTING THAT

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.012
INVESTMENT NUMBER ONE NUMBER

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.514
TWO IS THAT. I THINK WE SHOULD

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:44.682
USE THE FEDERAL FUNDS FIRST

00:39:44.749 --> 00:39:46.016
THEY HAVE A DROP DEAD DEADLINE

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:46.951
AND SO I THINK WE GOT TO

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:48.853
PRIORITIZE AND GET THAT MONEY

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:52.656
OUT. IN AND UTILIZED- IN

00:39:52.723 --> 00:39:55.559
REGARDS TO THE- THE ISSUE THAT

00:39:55.626 --> 00:39:58.329
THE DOG. SENATOR NIELSEN RACED.

00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:00.598
IS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS

00:40:00.664 --> 00:40:04.735
PROPOSAL A NUMBER. OF HOUSING.

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:07.071
MONEY GOING TO ENTITIES THAT

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.640
WHOSE. FIRST PRIORITY IS NOT

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:12.443
NECESSARILY HOUSING SO- THE

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.844
MONEY GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:14.945
OF SOCIAL SERVICES THEY HAVE

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:17.481
THEIR JOB. IS ON THE CAL WORKS

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:21.185
PROGRAM- AND- AND THIS IS A

00:40:21.252 --> 00:40:22.653
REALLY GOOD ADDRESS TO IT I

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.655
BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT AND I

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.390
WANT TO SEE IT HAPPEN. BUT I DO

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:28.459
THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE UNDER

00:40:28.526 --> 00:40:30.027
THE LEADERSHIP OF A CD BECAUSE

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:32.129
EACH CD UNDERSTANDS HOUSING AND

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:33.631
THEY UNDERSTAND. KIND OF THE

00:40:33.697 --> 00:40:36.200
PARAMETERS AROUND- BUILDING

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.068
HOUSING PROTECTING IT FOR.

00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:40.571
CERTAIN PURPOSE AND- AND THEY

00:40:40.638 --> 00:40:41.906
HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THAT AND

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:44.441
BY THE SAME TOKEN- THE MONEY IS

00:40:44.508 --> 00:40:46.977
GOING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NO

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:47.878
QUESTION WE NEED MENTAL HEALTH

00:40:47.945 --> 00:40:51.348
SERVCES. BUT BUT THERE MAY BE

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.717
LIMITATIONS ON WHAT WELL WE

00:40:53.784 --> 00:40:55.619
NEED THE DATA WE NEED TO BE

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.487
ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT DATA TO

00:40:56.554 --> 00:41:00.624
SAY- IF WE MARRY. HOUSING WITH

00:41:00.691 --> 00:41:01.959
THESE PARTICULAR SERVICES THAT

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:03.427
YOU GET MORE BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:04.528
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT AND WE

00:41:04.595 --> 00:41:05.563
NEED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:06.730
DATE IN THE INFORMATION

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:09.967
CONSISTENT. ACROSS THE

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:12.303
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. TOM AND-

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:18.742
THEN- THERE IS A- HM THE

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:24.315
PROPOSAL INCLUDES THAT THE HOME

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:28.352
KEY FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM.

00:41:28.419 --> 00:41:30.721
WOULD WOULD BE IN TWO PARTS THE

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.857
FIRST PART THE MONEY WOULD GO

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:34.191
UP BY A PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY

00:41:34.258 --> 00:41:35.426
WOULD GO TO BIG CITIES

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:37.294
AUTOMATICALLY AND THAT THE

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:39.797
SMALLER CITIES WE WOULD RECEIVE

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:41.232
THEIR BITE INTO THE BIGGER

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:42.166
CITIES WOULD GET IT PER CAPITA

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:44.068
PER CAPITA THE SMALLER CITIES

00:41:44.134 --> 00:41:45.469
HAVE TO FIGHT IT'S A

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:47.838
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM AS AS

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.340
A SENATOR THAT REPRESENTS

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.408
NOTHING BUT SMALLER CITIES- I

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:53.544
OPPOSE THAT. I THINK THAT IF

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:54.044
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:55.412
COMPETITIVE IT'S COMPETITIVE

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:56.780
ACROSS THE BOARD OTHERWISE I

00:41:56.847 --> 00:42:01.018
THINK WE OUGHT TO DO IT WE ARE

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:04.722
DIVIDED BASED ON- BASED ON ON-

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:06.824
THAT POPULATION BECAUSE I HAVE

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:09.560
HEARD NOTHING BUT CONCERN FROM

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.463
THE SMALLER CITIES ABOUT.

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:14.899
MONEY'S GOING TO THE COUNTIES

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:17.701
AND THE MONEY NEVER GETTING TO

00:42:17.768 --> 00:42:18.335
THE SMALLER CITIES IN THAT

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:20.604
COUNTY AND SO I WANT TO I WANT

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:22.640
TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT I DON'T

00:42:22.706 --> 00:42:25.709
THINK THAT. THERE'S ALWAYS A

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:26.944
CARVE OUT FOR THE BIG CITIES

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:28.345
AND I GET THAT THEIR ISSUES MAY

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:29.613
BE A LITTLE BIT BIGGER THAN

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.148
SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES BUT

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.483
EVERYBODY IS SUFFERING UNDER

00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:34.251
STAFFED WITH THIS HOMELESS

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:34.785
ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK WE

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:37.655
SHOULD. WE SHOULD PENALIZE THE

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.056
SMALLER. THE SMALLER

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:40.391
COMMUNITIES AS WELL I THINK

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:41.725
THAT PRETTY MUCH TAKES CARE OF

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:42.793
THE ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.297
ABOUT. THIS THIS IS THE NUMBER

00:42:46.363 --> 00:42:47.698
ONE ISSUE THE CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:42:47.765 --> 00:42:50.067
CONCERNED ABOUT. SO THE REASON

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:50.935
THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON

00:42:51.001 --> 00:42:52.503
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:53.604
AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:42:53.671 --> 00:42:55.539
THE RESOURCES. A MASSIVE AMOUNT

00:42:55.606 --> 00:42:58.042
OF MONEY THAT WE- THAT ARE PART

00:42:58.108 --> 00:42:59.877
OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. WHICH

00:42:59.944 --> 00:43:02.379
I THINK IS APPROPRIATE- THAT WE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.316
HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:06.617
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:07.785
THROWING MONEY OUT THERE AND

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:10.988
AS- SENATOR COM AUGER SAID-

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.656
PEOPLE ARE GETTING LOTS OF

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.158
MONEY THEY HAVE A LOT TO STAFF

00:43:14.224 --> 00:43:16.060
WORKING BUT- WE'RE NOT. HOUSING

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.728

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.700

THESE PIECES SO BRIEFLY WHERE

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.401
THOSE PIECES ARE FIRST- THEY'RE

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:00.135
A LITTLE OUT OF ORDER FROM

01:09:00.202 --> 01:09:01.103
WHERE THEY ARE IN YOUR AGENDA I

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:04.840
APOLOGIZE. BUT I'M I'M DOING

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:06.642
THEM PHONETICALLY. ON THE FIRST

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:07.877
THE FIFTH CLIMATE YOU ASSESSED

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:08.644

THAT PHASE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. I

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:53.589
ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.190
FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT WOULD

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:56.725
INCLUDE THE FIRST OF ITS KIND

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.127
EITHER HERE IN CALIFORNIA OR

01:09:58.193 --> 01:09:59.361

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.004
ATTENTION. TO TRIBAL APPROACHES

MANAGEMENT. THE SECOND IS ALL

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:13.108
TALK ABOUT IS. REALLY FINDING

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.376
ACTIONABLE CLIMATE SCIENCE

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:15.678
THAT'S ABOUT TURNING AGAIN THAT

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:18.080
SCIENCE ACTION JUST FIVE

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:19.048
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE OFFICE

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:19.815
OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.450
THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:22.217
ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.552
PROGRAM WHICH WAS CREATED

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:25.421
THROUGH SB TWO FORTY SIX. THAT

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.623
IS THE ONLY STATUTORILY CREATED

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:28.424
CLIMATE RESILIENCE PROGRAM IN

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:30.559
THE STATE THIS WOULD INVEST IN

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:32.728
I. KERR- WHICH IS A PUBLIC BODY

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:34.830
HI BY INVESTING IN TOOLS TO

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.265
TRANSLATE COMPLEX CLIMATE

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.199
SCIENCE INTO ACTION AND

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:40.035
IMPORTANTLY WOULD ALSO SUPPORT

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.537
A NEW ID CARD VULNERABLE

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.005
COMMUNITIES PLATFORM WHICH

01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:44.640
ALLOWS US TO START MAPPING.

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.141
THOSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.376
STATE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.677
TO CLIMATE IMPACTS MANY OF

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.112
WHICH ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.513
THAT ARE NOT ALWAYS CAPTURED

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.584
EASILY BY OTHER. TOOLS THAT WE

01:10:55.651 --> 01:10:56.218
HELP TO MEASURE EQUITY IMPACTS.

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.753
THE THIRD BIG AREA THE CLIMATE

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.988
ADAPTATION RESILIENCE GREAT

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.123
GRANT PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:01.790
TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:03.959
OVER TWO YEARS TO OPR TO FIND.

LOCAL AND REGIONAL CLIMATE

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.228
ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE

01:11:06.295 --> 01:11:08.397
GRANTS ONE THING WE HEAR OVER

01:11:08.464 --> 01:11:09.598
AND OVER TO A PR IS THAT

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:11.800
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SUPPORT

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:12.601
AT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL

01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.103
LEVEL. FOR A LONG TERM CLIMATE

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.437
ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE

01:11:15.504 --> 01:11:17.206
PLANNING. OUT THE ECONOMIC

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:18.741
IMPACTS OF CODE NINETEEN ON

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:20.109
LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNMENTS

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:21.610
ONLY EXACERBATED THIS DYNAMIC

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.245
AND MADE IT EVEN HARDER FOR

01:11:23.312 --> 01:11:23.879
THESE GOVERNMENTS DO THAT KIND

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.648
OF PLANNING. THESE GRANTS WILL

01:11:25.714 --> 01:11:26.849
SUPPORT LOCAL AND REGIONAL

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:27.916
ADAPTATION PLANNING AND

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:30.919
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.321
TO THAT LONG TERM RESILIENCE.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.722
BUT NEXT DECIDE LIKE TO POINT

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:34.823
TO IS REALLY A PART OF OUR

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:36.725
COMMUNITY DRIVEN STRATEGY WE

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:38.694
KNOW THAT CLIMATE IMPACTS ARE

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.828
FELT VERY DIFFERENTLY ACROSS

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:40.863
THE STATE WE KNOW THAT HAD THE

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:42.297
SOLUTIONS PLAY OUT VERY

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.666
DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE STATE.

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:44.700
AND THAT THOSE SOLUTIONS NEED

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.535
TO BE COMMUNITY DRIVEN. ONE OF

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:47.870
THE MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMS AT

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.204
THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.873
THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW TO DO

01:11:50.939 --> 01:11:52.341
THOSE PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:53.909
THEY BRING TOGETHER CLIMATE

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.778
HOUSING WORKFORCE

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:58.981
TRANSPORTATION. OUT AT WORK AND

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:00.683
TRAINING ALL IN ONE PROJECT IS

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:01.717
THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:04.086
COMMUNITIES PROGRAM. THE BUDGET

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.587
PROPOSAL INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.089
AND TWENTY MILLION OVER THREE

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.090
YEARS TO THE STRATEGIC GROWTH

COUNCIL TO CONTINUE THAT

01:12:09.191 --> 01:12:11.393
PROGRAM. AND MAKES A STAINTHE

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.362
PLACE BASED IN INVESTMENTS INTO

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:14.329
THE STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED

01:12:14.396 --> 01:12:16.565
COMMUNITIES. AND THIS PROGRAM

01:12:16.632 --> 01:12:18.400
REALLY SHOULD BE SEEN AS-

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:19.702
INTEGRATING ALL THOSE ELEMENTS

01:12:19.768 --> 01:12:20.803
I TALKED ABOUT BUT IT'S ALSO A

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.771
HOUSING PROGRAM AND A AND T. C.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:23.605
C. IS REALLY HOUSING

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.340
INNOVATION. KIND OF

BENEFIT FROM THESE INTEGRATED

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.954
COMMUNITY DRIVEN APPROACHES.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.289
TCC I WANT TO KNOW IT ALREADY

01:12:40.355 --> 01:12:41.790

STATE. URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL ALL

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:08.984
KINDS OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:12.454
LOOKING. AT TAKING THESE

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:13.021
INTEGRATED APPROACHES. AND

ENVISIONED BY SP TEN SEVENTY

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.135
TWO. THIS PROGRAM REALLY DOES

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:28.337
THE WORK TO HELP DIRECTLY

COMMUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.674
THE KINDS OF STAKEHOLDER

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:34.176
PROCESS IS THAT WE ALL TALK

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.178
ABOUT ALL THE TIME. BUILDING A

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:37.813
PLAN WE'RE DOING AN INFORMATION

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.948
STRATEGY WE'RE LOOKING AT A- A

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.550
REGIONAL APPROACH TO

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:43.018
DEVELOPMENT WE NEED TO MAKE

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.052
SURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:45.687
PART OF THAT. I DID PART OF

01:13:45.754 --> 01:13:47.456
THAT PLANNING PROCESS AND THIS

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.991
PROGRAM ALLOWS THAT TO HAPPEN

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:51.126
BY PROVIDING DIRECT CAPACITY

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:52.995
SUPPORT TO THESE COMMUNITIES

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:54.329
THAT CAN BE THINGS LIKE CHILD

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:55.597
CARE AT MEETINGS THAT CAN BE

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.566
DIRECT HONORARIA TO PARTICIPATE

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.501
IT CAN BE. A CAPACITY BUILDING

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.669
IT WILL BE VERY VERY LOCAL

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.404
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.972
THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE THAT

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.307
UNDERLIES SO MUCH OF OUR

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:07.009
BUDGET. REALLY JUST INSURING

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:09.978
THAT WE ARE TAKING A COMMUNITY

01:14:10.045 --> 01:14:10.979
DRIVEN APPROACH. I ONLY SEE

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:12.648
MORE THING ABOUT HANDED UP TO

THERE AREN'T VERY MANY LEFT.

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.899
THAT MEANS THAT THE FORCES THAT

01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.934

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:54.269

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.723
BE THE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. AND

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.525

ADDRESSES AND I. I'VE BEEN

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:49.843
WORKING REALLY HARD IN THE

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.645
SPACE BECAUSE I HAVE A BILL

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:53.547
THAT IF WE APPROVE THIS BUDGET

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:57.718
DISAPPEARS. SO BUT BUT- AND

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.486
HAVING HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.155
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT-

01:41:01.221 --> 01:41:04.425
STAKEHOLDERS- THE BLOCKAGES AT

01:41:04.491 --> 01:41:07.428
THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND WHAT THIS

01:41:07.494 --> 01:41:08.962
ANTICIPATES IS PUTTING THE

01:41:09.029 --> 01:41:12.599
RESOURCES OUT TO THE LOCAL.

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:16.303
GOVERNMENT TO HELP FIND THE

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:19.606
WORK THAT NEEDS TO GET DONE-

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:21.275
THE TESTIMONY AT THE HEARING

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:22.943
WAS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING LIKE

01:41:23.010 --> 01:41:23.710
TWENTY DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT

01:41:23.777 --> 01:41:25.546
ARE INVOLVED IN AND LOOKING AT

01:41:25.612 --> 01:41:27.648
WHETHER IT- THAT PROPERTY

01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:29.516
SPECIFIC SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IS

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.852
BEEN DONE APPROPRIATELY- ALL OF

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:33.320
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT'S A

01:41:33.387 --> 01:41:34.955
QUESTION OF PUTTING THE

01:41:35.022 --> 01:41:37.124
RESOURCES. TO CREATING THE

01:41:37.191 --> 01:41:38.392
ORDINANCES THAT MAKE IT

01:41:38.459 --> 01:41:40.327
POSSIBLE TO ACTUALLY MOVE THIS

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:44.398
FORWARD AND SO- HI I AM A- I

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:47.234
THINK THIS. THERE'S SOMETHING

01:41:47.301 --> 01:41:48.535
FOR EVERYBODY TO LIKE AND NOT

01:41:48.602 --> 01:41:50.237
LIKE IN THIS WHICH MEANS IT'S

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:54.374
PROBABLY A GOOD COMPROMISE- I-

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:59.346
APPRECIATE THE- ON. THE THERE

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:02.216
WERE THERE WERE THE PROPOSAL IS

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:04.117
IT FOR IT TO BE A GRANT PROCESS

01:42:04.184 --> 01:42:05.085
RIGHT NOW AND I'M THINKING THAT

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.921
IT MAY BE IT MAY MAKE AND I

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.823
UNDERSTOOD THAT IF THE LOCAL

01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:11.425
JURISDICTION EXCEPT ACCEPTS A

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:12.626
GRANT AND THEN DOESN'T DO WHAT

01:42:12.693 --> 01:42:14.294
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO

01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:15.195
THAT THERE'S A CALLBACK PERMIT

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:17.297
PROVISION I DIDN'T HEAR THAT

01:42:17.364 --> 01:42:19.700
MENTIONED TODAY BUT IT MAY MAKE

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:21.335
SENSE FOR US TO DO IT AS A AS A

01:42:21.401 --> 01:42:23.270
GRANT THAT CAN BE FORGIVEN. IN

01:42:23.337 --> 01:42:24.204
OTHER WORDS IT'S A LOAN THAT

01:42:24.271 --> 01:42:25.606
CAN BE FORGIVEN IF YOU GET YOUR

01:42:25.672 --> 01:42:27.441
ACT TOGETHER AND YOU START-

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:30.644
APPROVING THESE THESE- THESE

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:31.812
LICENSES MOVING I'M HEARD FROM

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.981
PROVISIONAL TO ANNUAL IS REALLY

01:42:34.047 --> 01:42:36.783
WHAT WE WANT- AND I DO WANNA

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:39.086
SECOND WITH MY GOOD COLLEAGUE

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:39.953
FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SAID

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.922
IS THAT I THINK ALONG WITH THIS

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.590
PROPOSAL UP WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:45.092
OF A DROUGHT AND TO HAVE

01:42:45.158 --> 01:42:48.896
ILLEGAL DIVERT HERS OF WATER-

01:42:48.962 --> 01:42:51.899
TO MAINTAIN AN ILLEGAL PRODUCT-

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:53.800
IS PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS AND

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:54.701
I'M TOLD THAT IT'S A

01:42:54.768 --> 01:42:56.003
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER I

01:42:56.069 --> 01:42:56.870
THINK WE OUGHT TO PUT MONEY

01:42:56.937 --> 01:42:58.739
INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE

01:42:58.805 --> 01:43:01.241
TO GO UP THERE AND- TO STOP THE

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:04.144
ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS- AND- IT'S A

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:05.712
IT'S A WATER BOARD ISSUE AND

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.314
THE MORE THAT WE CAN. CREATE

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:09.182
THESE TEAMS TO GO IN AND DO THE

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.050
WORK I THINK THAT WOULD BE

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.151
REALLY IMPORTANT I'VE BEEN

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:13.186
INVITED TO GO ON A TOUR WITH

AND. PLANT PLAN TO TAKE HIM UP

01:43:19.059 --> 01:43:21.328
ON THAT. BECAUSE IF IT MEANS

01:43:21.395 --> 01:43:22.963
WE'D HAVE MORE WATER FOR THE

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:24.698
LEGITIMATE USES THAT WE NEED IN

01:43:24.765 --> 01:43:26.166

TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION FUND

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:30.964
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:32.032
TECHNOLOGY ARE THAT

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.867
MINISTRATION IS ASKING. FIRST

OF ALL- THIS FIFTEEN MILLION

01:44:35.836 --> 01:44:38.605
DOLLAR ASK IS A OVER A THREE

01:44:38.672 --> 01:44:42.042
YEAR PERIOD- AND IS TO FIND-

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.243
LOOKING TO FIND SMALLER

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:45.479
INITIATIVES IN THE RANGE OF TWO

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:47.147
TO THREE MILLION DOLLAR EACH-

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:49.816
WITH A TOTAL OF POSSIBLY TEN TO

01:44:49.883 --> 01:44:51.284
FIFTEEN MILLIONS OVER THREE

01:44:51.351 --> 01:44:54.855
YEAR PERIOD- IT IS A MODEL THAT

01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:55.589
WE ARE LEARNING FROM THE

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:57.257
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT HAVE

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:58.258
HAD THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:44:58.325 --> 01:45:00.560
MODERNIZATION FUND ESTABLISHED

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.529
SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN.

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:04.531
AND RECENTLY WITH THE INFLUX

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:07.334
OF- FURTHER INVESTMENT UPWARDS

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:08.802
OF A ONE BILLION DOLLAR

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:10.570
INTERNET TECHNOLOGY

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:13.273
MODERNIZATION FUND GIVING THE-

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.242
IMPORTANT ROLE WITH THAT THAT

01:45:15.308 --> 01:45:22.783
DIGITAL PLATFORM IF NEEDED. IN

01:45:22.849 --> 01:45:24.918
GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS. AND THAT-

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:25.552
SO I WANT TO SURE THAT THE IS

01:45:25.619 --> 01:45:27.788
NOT A BRAND COST BUT IT'S- A

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:30.524
PROGRAM- THIRD BAD THIS FINAL

01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:33.527
PRETTY. GOING TO BE YOU. FOR

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:36.863
ACTUALLY MAIN. WHINY IS TO- PER.

01:45:36.930 --> 01:45:39.299
A STAR UP FUND IF YOU- TO SERVE

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:41.301
SOME OF THE PROOF OF CONCEPT

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:43.303
DATA VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS IN THE

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:44.404
STATE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO

01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.873
LAUNCH AND THEY MAY NOT BE

01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:48.375
PERFECTLY FIT INTO THE- BUDGET

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:50.477
CYCLE. BUT INSTEAD OF WAITING

01:45:50.544 --> 01:45:51.945
FOR THE BUDGET CYCLE THIS WOULD

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.280
BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FUND SOME

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:54.314
OF THE INITIATIVE IN THE

01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:57.384
SMALLER SCALE- SECOND ID IF

01:45:57.451 --> 01:46:00.320
THERE WERE- HIGH RISK. MISSION

01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.688
CRITICAL SYSTEMS THAT WERE

01:46:01.755 --> 01:46:03.490
DISCOVERED BASED ON THE

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.058
STABILIZATION EFFORT THAT MY

01:46:05.125 --> 01:46:06.359
DEPARTMENT HAS PROPOSED AT THE

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:07.828
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS

01:46:07.894 --> 01:46:10.597
FINDING WOULD POTENTIALLY HELP

01:46:10.664 --> 01:46:11.331
TO ACTUALLY MITIGATE SOME OF

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:13.300
THE MOST RISK IN A MORE RAPID

01:46:13.366 --> 01:46:16.036
MANNER INSTEAD OF. WAITING FOR

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:18.271
THE FULL- BUT JUST CYCLE. AND

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:20.107
THIRD IF THERE ARE SOME- A

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:21.775
SECURITY VULNERABILITY THAT WAS

01:46:21.842 --> 01:46:23.276
DISCOVERED YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT

01:46:23.343 --> 01:46:25.145
THE YEAR THIS COULD POTENTIALLY

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:26.747
HELP WITH THAT EFFORT AS WELL.

01:46:26.813 --> 01:46:28.115
SO REALLY THOSE ARE THE PURPOSE

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:31.651
OF THIS PARTICULAR FUND- LASTLY

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:32.886
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:36.356
MADE CLEAR- AND I BELIEVE THIS

01:46:36.423 --> 01:46:37.691
IS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:39.693
CONCERN THAT. THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.561
MODERNIZATION FUND- IT'S NOT

01:46:41.628 --> 01:46:44.331
SOMETHING I DEVELOPED TO

01:46:44.397 --> 01:46:45.932
CLINICAL CIRCUMVENT THE

01:46:45.999 --> 01:46:47.567
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WITH THE

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:51.071
MUCH LARGER- INVESTMENT- DEEP

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:52.572
PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.241
PROCESS BUT THE LARGER

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.710
INVESTMENT CONTINUE TO. EXIST

01:46:56.777 --> 01:46:58.845
AND IN FACT IF SOME OF THESE

01:46:58.912 --> 01:47:00.647
PROOF OF CONCEPT YOU KNOW

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:03.116
DEVELOPS TO BE. WORTH A LARGER

01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:05.852
SCALE INVESTMENT A BAD WAY TO

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:07.654
GO THROUGH THAT OR COMPLETING

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:08.922
THAT PROJECT APPROVALS LIFE

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:10.423
CYCLE WHICH INVOLVES

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:13.560
LEGISLATIVE- DE OVERSIGHT-

01:47:13.627 --> 01:47:15.195
LASTLY ONE OTHER THINGS I WANT

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:24.271
TO POINT OUT. IS TIED TO- WE

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:25.138
UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT THE

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:28.074
CONCERN TO STAY HEY I SO- WE IS

01:47:28.141 --> 01:47:31.678
LET. INVOLVED AND IN TODAY'S.

01:47:31.745 --> 01:47:33.146
THAT MANY THE PAR- WHEN IT

01:47:33.213 --> 01:47:36.349
COMES TO OF IN A AS SUCH DATE.

01:47:36.416 --> 01:47:37.484
FIND A WAY TO IT COMES. WITHOUT

01:47:37.551 --> 01:47:38.919
BIZ THE- TO DEBORAH SENSE

01:47:38.985 --> 01:47:40.420
INCLUDING RELIGIOUS. OR THE

01:47:40.487 --> 01:47:41.588
JUST THE FAR DOING THAT AND

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:44.057
TELL THINGS BECOME DIRE THEN

01:47:44.124 --> 01:47:46.526
YOU GET A BIG- INVESTMENT

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.361
REQUEST TO SAY WE GOT TO DO IT

01:47:48.428 --> 01:47:50.730
BECAUSE NOW IT'S- A YOU KNOW A

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:53.200
BAD. STAGE SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:54.367
TO DO IS TO GET IN FRONT OF

01:47:54.434 --> 01:47:56.736
THAT NUMBER ONE THAT WE DID

01:47:56.803 --> 01:47:59.506
AGREE TO- IF THIS HAVE THE

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:01.107

UTILIZATION OF SUCH FUNDING

01:48:07.047 --> 01:48:09.316
PROVIDED VISIBILITY THAT

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:10.584
OTHERWISE STATE LEGISLATURE

01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:12.319
WOULD NOT HAVE HAD. AND MORE

01:48:12.385 --> 01:48:14.354
IMPORTANTLY THIS WOULD ALLOW US

01:48:14.421 --> 01:48:15.755
TO GET IN FRONT OF THE SOME OF

01:48:15.822 --> 01:48:17.624
THE- YOU KNOW MISSION CRITICAL

01:48:17.691 --> 01:48:20.427

PROPOSAL OUR FIRST THE REQUEST

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:53.994
WOULD LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S

THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE

01:49:07.507 --> 01:49:08.541
INVOLVED THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.710
AGENCY I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR MANY

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:52.979
MANY YEARS AND I FIND THEM TO

01:50:53.046 --> 01:50:55.749
BE TOP TOP PANTS EXCELLENT

01:50:55.815 --> 01:50:57.851
PEOPLE VERY DEDICATED VERY

01:50:57.917 --> 01:51:00.787
SINCERE. I HAVE TO WEIGH THAT

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:02.255
AGAINST THE FACT THAT THIS

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:04.524
ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN A MESS

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:06.860
EVER SINCE IT STARTED. NOW IT'S

01:51:06.926 --> 01:51:08.328
BEEN IMPROVING AND I GIVE THE

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:10.997
CURRENT LEADERSHIP A LOT OF

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:13.733
CREDIT FOR THAT HAPPENING. BUT

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.870
IT'S STILL A PROBLEM AGENCY WHY.

01:51:16.936 --> 01:51:20.140
MOST RECENTLY ET D. ANOTHER

01:51:20.206 --> 01:51:23.710
TERRIBLY PROBLEMATIC AGENCY HAD

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:25.545
TWO CRASHES AND BURNS OF A THAI

01:51:25.612 --> 01:51:27.180
TEA APPOINTMENT AT A CRITICAL

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:31.618
MOMENT. WHERE OUR CITIZENS ARE

01:51:31.684 --> 01:51:34.821
SUFFERING GRIEVOUSLY. BY THE

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:36.990
INCOMPETENCE OF THAT AGENCY AND

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:39.692
I WONDER I CAN'T QUIT GOES DOWN.

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:42.529
THE ISSUE IS THAT FOR DECADES

01:51:42.595 --> 01:51:45.031
FAR PRE DATING THIS LEADERSHIP-

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:46.766
BEEN PUT THERE TO STRAIGHTEN

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:49.769
OUT THE MESS. AND I FEEL FOR

01:51:49.836 --> 01:51:51.271
THEM BECAUSE IT'S A FORMIDABLE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:54.340
MASS. BUT FOR DECADES THESE

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.376
BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS HAVE

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:58.344
NEVER COME IN ON TIME THEY'VE

01:51:58.411 --> 01:52:00.747
NEVER COME IN ON BUDGET. AND I

01:52:00.814 --> 01:52:01.915
FOR THE I. T. COMPANIES

01:52:01.981 --> 01:52:06.219
THEMSELVES. FOR THE WAY THIS IS

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:07.787
ALL COME DOWN. THEY ARE

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:09.255
EXPLOITING THE CALIFORNIA

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:10.857
TAXPAYER FOR THEIR OWN BOTTOM

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.660
LINE ADVANTAGES. GIVING US A

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:14.761
QUICK BUT THAT DOES NOT

01:52:14.828 --> 01:52:17.664
FUNCTION AS PROMISED. BUT BUT

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:20.100
RATHER OFFERS HOLLOW PROMISES.

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:22.802
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE DARE NOT

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:25.105
AT THIS TIME GIVE UP ANY MORE

01:52:25.171 --> 01:52:27.874
OF OUR REVIEW AUTHORITY

01:52:27.941 --> 01:52:30.376
OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY AND THE

01:52:30.443 --> 01:52:32.445

IN THIS TOO I THINK THEY HAVE

01:52:38.585 --> 01:52:41.955
BEEN UP SOME GUILT IN THE

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:43.857
NEGOTIATION OF CONTRACTS. SO WE

01:52:43.923 --> 01:52:45.358
CAN'T WE CAN'T TAKE THIS

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:46.860
LIGHTLY IT'S COSTING US

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.995

RESOURCES. AND IT DOESN'T MAKE

02:01:34.286 --> 02:01:34.854

I THE COST OF SECOND ROW IS

COST OF THE FIRST ROUND AND

02:12:13.358 --> 02:12:14.526
THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:16.094
WOULD REACH A LARGER NUMBER OF

THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO PROVIDE

PANDEMIC RELIEF IS LIMITED. AND

02:12:36.581 --> 02:12:38.617
SO MINDFUL THAT WE POINTED OUT

02:12:38.684 --> 02:12:39.685
THAT I NEVER REALLY FOR THE

02:12:39.751 --> 02:12:41.420
STATE SHOULD FIRST TARGET THOSE

02:12:41.486 --> 02:12:44.356
MOST IN NEED. AND SECONDLY TRY

02:12:44.423 --> 02:12:46.024

HOUSEHOLDS. WOULD HAVE RECEIVED

02:13:18.423 --> 02:13:19.991
MUCH LESS IN COMBINED STATE AND

MINDFUL OF THIS INEQUITY IN- WE

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:53.658

WE- HOW DO WE WORK WITH OUR

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:36.555
PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THAT

02:16:36.621 --> 02:16:38.790
PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE

02:16:38.857 --> 02:16:41.393
MONEY CAN ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT.

02:16:41.459 --> 02:16:43.528
I'M SO I'LL START OFF BY SAYING

02:16:43.595 --> 02:16:46.331
THAT THE- THE- THE WAY THIS IS

02:16:46.398 --> 02:16:48.233
GOING TO WORK IS FOR THAT TAX

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:49.935
FILERS HAVE ALREADY FILED A

TWENTY TWENTY TAX RETURNS SO.

02:16:51.536 --> 02:16:52.637

TO GET TO GET PAYMENTS OUT TO-

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:06.551
TAPS TO THOSE FILERS. SO IF

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:07.552
YOU'RE ON IF YOU'RE ASKING

02:17:07.619 --> 02:17:09.120
ABOUT OUT REACHED OUT

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:10.422
SPECIFICALLY FOR LIKE EARNED

02:17:10.488 --> 02:17:11.723
INCOME TAX CREDIT AND THEN I

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:13.858
CAN TURN THAT OVER TO MY

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:14.426
COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:17.729
FINANCE. THAT WOULD BE FINE.

02:17:17.796 --> 02:17:19.464
GOOD AFTERNOON TURKS AMIDST

02:17:19.531 --> 02:17:21.199
PARTNER FINANCE. THE

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.734
MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT

02:17:22.801 --> 02:17:25.570
THE COUNTY THE ITC PROGRAM.

02:17:25.637 --> 02:17:27.038
PARTICIPATION AMONG ELIGIBLE

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:29.541
POPULATIONS CONTINUE TO RISE.

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:30.308
BECAUSE THERE'S A MUCH GREATER

02:17:30.375 --> 02:17:32.677
AWARENESS OF THE COUNTY ITC

02:17:32.744 --> 02:17:33.979
PROGRAM AS IT ENTERS ITS SIXTH

02:17:34.045 --> 02:17:35.814
YEAR AND BECAUSE AVAILABLE

02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:37.349
STATISTICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES

02:17:37.415 --> 02:17:38.817
THAT OUTREACH IS NOT A

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:39.751
SIGNIFICANT DRIVER

02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:41.586
PARTICIPATION RATES. THE

02:17:41.653 --> 02:17:43.121
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT POSE IN

02:17:43.188 --> 02:17:46.891
THE AVERAGE FUNDING IN THE

02:17:46.958 --> 02:17:47.525
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. A

02:17:47.592 --> 02:17:49.861
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. SO IT'S SO

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:54.799
THE- THE ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN-ZEROED OUT IN OTHER WORDS. THAT

02:17:54.866 --> 02:18:00.138
IS CORRECT. SO- MATT WHAT MY

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:02.173
BIG CONCERN I HAVE IS THIS THAT

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:05.510
THE DATA THAT THAT I RECALL

02:18:05.577 --> 02:18:07.445
RECEIVING BECAUSE I DID I DID A

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:11.116
BUILT. IN THIS AREA. THAT

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:14.419
REQUIRES IF TB DID DO A REPORT.

02:18:14.486 --> 02:18:16.354
ON HABIT ON WHETHER THERE'S A

02:18:16.421 --> 02:18:32.337
PROCESS THAT WE CAN UTILIZE. TO

02:18:32.404 --> 02:18:32.971
EXPEDITE OR TO. IDENTIFY THOSE

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:33.571
IN THAT ARE L. FOR E. I. IT IS

02:18:33.638 --> 02:18:34.139
THE BIGGEST POVERTY PROGRAM

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:34.773
THAT WE AND WE DO A IN CONTROL

02:18:34.839 --> 02:18:35.473
WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO THE

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:38.943
OPERA TO GET- THAT EARNED

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.412
INCOME TAX CREDIT INTO THE

02:18:40.478 --> 02:18:42.580
HANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:18:42.647 --> 02:18:45.150
WORKING BUT ARE STILL POOR AND

02:18:45.216 --> 02:18:49.087
HAVE- HAVE HAVE NEEDS THAT ARE

02:18:49.154 --> 02:18:50.155
ARE GOING ON AND MATT IS REALLY

02:18:50.221 --> 02:18:53.658
IMPORTANT- MY BILL REQUIRES IT

02:18:53.725 --> 02:18:55.960
F. T. B. CREATE A REPORT TO SEE

02:18:56.027 --> 02:18:58.029
WHETHER THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO

02:18:58.096 --> 02:19:01.800
IDENTIFY. THOSE WORKERS AND

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:03.401
ADVISE THEM THAT THEY'RE

02:19:03.468 --> 02:19:05.937
ELIGIBLE AND OUT WITH THE

02:19:06.004 --> 02:19:07.272
POTENTIAL OF NOT HAVING TO FILE

02:19:07.338 --> 02:19:09.474
RETURN FOR IT THAT THEY

02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:10.809
RECEIVE A LETTER ADVISING THEM

02:19:10.875 --> 02:19:12.143
THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE IN ORDER

02:19:12.210 --> 02:19:15.780
TO FILE A RETURN. ON THAT. WHEN

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.182
I DID THAT BILL THAT WAS IN

02:19:17.248 --> 02:19:19.517
THERE WAS AN EIGHTY. THE DATA

02:19:19.584 --> 02:19:22.921
SHOWED. THAT WE WERE SPENDING

02:19:22.987 --> 02:19:23.688
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:27.025
OUTREACH. AND EDUCATION AND

02:19:27.092 --> 02:19:28.359
THAT WE WERE STILL MISSING A

02:19:28.426 --> 02:19:30.395
LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:33.832
ELIGIBLE WORKERS. IN OUR STATE.

02:19:33.898 --> 02:19:38.570
AND I DON'T SEE I HAVEN'T SEEN

02:19:38.636 --> 02:19:41.706
ANY DATA. THAT WOULD INDICATE

02:19:41.773 --> 02:19:45.376
THAT THAT SOMEHOW THAT.

02:19:45.443 --> 02:19:47.479
POPULATION HAS BECOME EDUCATED

02:19:47.545 --> 02:19:48.446
NOW AND THEY DON'T NEED ANY

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:49.514
MORE RESOURCES SO I'M REALLY

02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:51.449
CONCERNED ABOUT ZEROING OUT ANY

02:19:51.516 --> 02:19:55.587
KIND OF ASSISTANCE TO HELP

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:56.788
INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE

02:19:56.855 --> 02:19:59.891
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STIMULUS THE

02:19:59.958 --> 02:20:04.095
ATC PORTION OF THE STIMULUS.

THAT. I WOULD SAY THERE IS-

02:20:25.450 --> 02:20:27.218
INCONSISTENT DATA THAT EXISTS

02:20:27.285 --> 02:20:28.386
IN REGARDS TO WHETHER THERE IS

02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:29.821
