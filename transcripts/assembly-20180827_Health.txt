MISTER GRAYSON WHICH I TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. EMERGENCY AIR AMBULANCE SERVICES ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STATEWIDE EMS SYSTEM. AND PROVIDE A CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN RULE AREAS AND URBAN HOSPITALS. THEY ALSO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DISASTER RESPONSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY. IT'S CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS TRANSPORT ALL EMERGENCY PATIENTS WITHOUT KNOWING IF THE PATIENT HAS ANY FORM OF MEDICAL INSURANCE OR ABILITY TO PAY YET ALL PATIENTS ARE GIVEN THE SAME HIGH LEVEL OF CARE. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY THREE WILL REPLACE THE MEDI CAL RATE FOR THESE PROVIDERS TO THE RULE MEDICARE RATE THE MEDICARE RATES HAVE NOT BEEN ADJUSTED FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND A SUPPLEMENTAL FUND THAT HAS BEEN -- THAT IS HOW PROVIDERS IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR. SENATE AMENDMENTS ALSO INSTITUTE A PROHIBITION ON BALANCE BILLING BY AIR AMBULANCE PROVIDERS BY OAK FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE INSURED IN CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THAT CAREFULLY CRAFTED LANGUAGE IN THE BILL WILL ALLOW THE PLANS AND PROVIDERS TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH Y. REQUIRING THE PATIENT ONLY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ORDINARY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES.
