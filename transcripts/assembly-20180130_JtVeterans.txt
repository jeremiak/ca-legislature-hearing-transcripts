GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WE WERE WAITING FOR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER AND. AND. HOPEFULLY HE WILL BLOCK AND BEFORE. BEFORE THE END OF MY STATEMENT SO GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYBODY. THAT PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN A PERIOD OF IMPROVEMENTS ADDS CAL THAT IMPROVING PERFORMANCE IN ORGANIZATION ACCOUNTABILITY. AND RE ORIENTING THE DEPARTMENT TOWARD ITS PRIMARY MISSION SERVING A CALIFORNIA VETERANS. AMONG OTHER RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS CALVET HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE CONDITIONS ADD ITS NETWORK OF VETERANS HOMES. NOT OF THIS TRANSFORMATION COULD IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP OF SECRETARY EMBOSSED YANNI. WHOSE BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN KEY TO SQUARING AWAY THIS DEPARTMENT THE PERIOD OF GOOD LEADERSHIP AND A WELL FUNCTIONING DEPARTMENT IS SOMETHING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. TO MAKE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF POSITIVE CHANGE POSSIBLE AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE STRUCTURES AND PRACTICES IN PLACE THAT BE THAT CAN KEEP THE DEPARTMENT ON COURSE THROUGH EXPECTED AND UNEXPECTED CHANGES. AT MY REQUEST THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION UNDERTOOK A REVIEW OF CALVET VETERANS HOMES AND PUBLISHED TWO REPORTS LAST YEAR. THAT INDICATE. NO MATTER HOW YOU VIEW THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THERE IS A GREAT. DEAL OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AT THE HOMES. AND A PRESSING NEED TO CHANGE IN ORDER TO MEET THE FUTURE NEEDS. OF CHANGING OF THE CHANGING VETERAN POPULATION. TO THAT END LAST SUMMER THE LEGISLATURE IMPOSE A REQUIREMENT ON CAL THAT TO DEVISE A MASTER PLAN FOR BOTH THE OPERATION OF THE HOMES AS THE SYSTEM. AND FOR EACH HOME INDIVIDUALLY THAT PLAN IS DUE BY JULY TWENTY NINETEEN. BUT IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO CHECK IN AND ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND SKILLS ARE BEING APPLIED TO IT. WITH THE VETERAN POPULATION OF MORE THAN A MILLION AND WITH MORE VETERANS COMING HOME FROM THE LONGEST PERIOD OF CONFLICT IN AMERICAN HISTORY OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS A GREAT. AND GROWING LINE AND I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN'T TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE TO OUR VETERANS WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER FOR CO HOSTING THIS HEARING. AND ABSURD BONTA WALK IN THE DOOR. A ON CALIFORNIA VETERAN HOMES AND THE MEMBERS OF BOTH THE VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE BUDGET SUB FOR COMMITTEE AND. OTHER MEMBERS THAT SHOULD BE SHOWING UP AT ANY MOMENT THERE'S ANOTHER HEARING GOING ON THAT'S APPARENTLY MUCH MORE. ENTERTAINING. IT IS MY HONOR TO CONTINUE TO ASSEMBLY VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMITTEE AND WE ARE GOING TO START THIS HEARING WITH AN UPDATE FROM CAL THAT THEN HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. THE ALEJO AND THE VETERAN RESOURCE CENTER CENTERS OF AMERICA. AND SO WHY DON'T WE FIRST CALL UP OUR SECRETARY. DOCTOR A VETO AND BOSQUE YANNI. TO GIVE US AN UPDATE. GOOD AFTERNOON NICE TO SEE SO MANY. FAMILIAR FACES COMING BACK. THE WORLD OF VETERANS. REVENUE MADAM CHAIR IRWIN. OF ANTICIPATED RIVAL OF CHAIRMAN COOPER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND. A THANK YOU FOR ALL THE VETERANS IN THE ROOM FOR YOUR SERVICE. FIRST OFF. BUT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO IS TO PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE FURTHER IN AN ONGOING DISCUSSION REGARDING THE FUTURE OF OUR STATEWIDE VETERANS HOME SYSTEM. WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT OUR STATE KEEPS ITS PROMISE TO THOSE WHO SERVE ON OUR BEHALF. I AM EXCITED. TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. JIM COOPER. AND I HAVE HAPPY NEWS. ALL. OF OUR CMS RATED HOMES ARE NOW RATED AT FOUR OR FIVE STARS. PUTTING HIM AMONG THE TOP SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN THE NATION. I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE HIM PUBLICLY THANK THE LEADERS OF ARE VETERANS HOMES AND THEY'RE DEDICATED STAFF ON THIS REMARKABLE SUCCESS. BOB AND THAT INCLUDES BY DEPUTY SECRETARY TO MY RIGHT. JACOBY PETERSON. I'D ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE SOUND RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY LEGISLATIVE LEADERS SUCH AS YOURSELVES. AND BY OVERSIGHT BODIES SUCH AS THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. AND TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR VERY CONSIDERED AND THOUGHTFUL COUNCIL. REGULAR REVIEW OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE STATE IS VITALLY IMPORTANT. FINALLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE IMPORTANT POLICY DECISIONS WHICH WE SHOULD MAKE CONSCIOUSLY AND IN PARTNERSHIP WHICH IS WHY HEARINGS LIKE THIS TODAY. ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. CALVET HAS ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH IN RECENT YEARS AND SINCE YOU'VE GIVEN ME THE MICROPHONE FOR A FEW MINUTES. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE LAST TWO YEARS PARTICULARLY. I AM PROUD TO REPORT THE FOLLOWING. THE NEWEST VETERANS HOMES THOSE IN REDDING AND FRESNO. WHICH HAD SAT VACANT FOR SOMETIME DURING THE DEPTH OF BUDGET AUSTERITY. HAVE NOW REACHED THEIR FULL CAPACITY AND TOGETHER ARE SERVING UP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY VETERANS. THE REMAINING TWO SKILLED NURSING UNITS AT THE WEST LA HOME. WHICH WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY FOUR BEDS ARE POISED TO OPEN EMINENTLY PENDING FINAL STATE INSPECTION. OUR APPLICATION FOR WHICH IS PENDING WITH CD P. H.. WE MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS IN STANDARDIZING OPERATIONS IN ALL OF THE VETERANS HOMES. ALLOWING US TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES. SUCH AS IN NURSING CARE AND PHARMACY PRACTICES. ALSO WE'VE CREATED THE FIRST DEDICATED REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT TEAM AT CAL THAT. WITH THE RECENT AUGMENTATION TO OUR BUDGET FOR THAT PURPOSE. MULTIPLE REGULATORY INITIATIVES ARE NOW IN DEVELOPMENT. AND THE PACE IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. I'M PROUD OF THIS WORK IT WILL BRING ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY TO OUR OPERATIONS CLARIFY ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR THE HOMES. AND PRIORITIZE ADMISSIONS AND BOTTOM LINE IT'S JUST GOOD GOVERNMENT. LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO UPDATE THE MILITARY AND VETERANS CODE. ALLOWING CALVET TO OPERATE MORE EFFECTIVELY AND REFINE OUR ADMISSIONS CRITERIA TO ENSURE WE FIRST SERVE THOSE VETERANS WHO HAVE THE GREATEST NEED. AND WHO SACRIFICE THE MOST. OUR AGENCY IS ADOPTING AND EXPANDING TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES. OUR TELEMEDICINE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE VA NOW SERVES FOR VETERANS HOMES. WE'VE COMPLETED THE INSTALLATION OF AN AUTOMATED PHARMACY SYSTEM WIDE. AND WE'VE BEGUN TO WORK ON AN ONLINE PORTAL TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL VETERANS TO APPLY FOR ADMISSION AND TO DETERMINE THEIR PLACE ON THE WAITLIST. OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD PROJECT IS ENTERING THE PROCUREMENT PHASE AND WE EXPECT THE ROLL OUT TO BEGIN LATER THIS YEAR WITH PILOT PROJECTS. WE HAVE A BUDGET PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE PRIVATE ROOMS FOR ALL SINGLE RESIDENTS IN YOUNG FILLS DOMICILIARY. PROVIDING A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE THAT REFLECTS THE CHANGING DEMAND FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. WE'RE MAKING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO PROTECT THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THE VETERANS HOME TO MODERNIZE DAM OPERATIONS. AND TO ENHANCE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TOWN OF YOUNTVILLE. ALL WHILE PROVIDING ABOUT PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY OF THE WATERSHED. AND FINALLY. AS YOU ALL KNOW CALVET HAS AN ITEM IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. FUND THE REPLACEMENT OF YOU DON'T BILLS NOW OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY YEAR OLD SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BUILDING. IT SUMMARY MY TENURE THUS FAR AS SECRETARY OF CALVET. HAS BEEN TRULY REWARDING PARTICULARLY. WITH REGARD TO THE VETERANS HOMES. MY TOP PRIORITY IS NOW A REALITY. EIGHT VETERANS HOMES ALL OF HIGH QUALITY SPANNING THE STATE FROM READING TO CHILL OF VISTA AND OFFERING CULTURALLY COMPETENT. WARM AND HOME LIKE CARE IN BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA SETTINGS. I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOWEVER THAT WE HAVE NOT AS SOLDIERS OFTEN SAY DROPPED OUR PACKS JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A TREE ACHIEVE SO MUCH SO MANY BIG GOALS FOR THE HOMES. RATHER WITH OUR EIGHT HOMES OPENING AND THRIVING WE MUST NOW BEGIN TO CHART A COURSE FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE FUTURE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN THIS STATE. KNOWING THIS CALVET HAS BEGUN TO EVALUATE AND RESEARCH THE EVOLUTION OF THE HOMES. EVEN BEFORE NEW LEGISLATION LAST YEAR MANDATE THAT A FORMAL PLANNING PROCESS BE PUT IN PLACE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN CALVET BROUGHT INTO RETIRED ANNUITANTS WHO SPECIALIZED IN DEMOGRAPHICS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THEIR RESEARCH REINFORCED WHAT WE SUSPECTED? SPECIFICALLY. THE DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING CARE MEMORY CARE AND MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE HIGH FOR YEARS TO COME. AND SECOND DEMAND FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE. AS PEOPLE AGE PAY PREFERRED TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES UNTIL THEY ABSOLUTELY REQUIRE SKILLED NURSING OR SIMILAR INSTITUTIONAL MEDICAL SUPPORT IN A FACILITY. IN RESPONSE TO THE MANDATES IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET. CALVET HAS RETAINED AND EXPERIENCED RESEARCHER WHO HAS BEGUN DEVELOPING THE REQUISITE SYSTEMIC AND HOME SPECIFIC MASTER PLANS. WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE TO FIND A FORMER STATISTICIAN AND STUDY COORDINATOR. FROM THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. WHO POSSESSES EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE VA'S CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY THE USE OF DATA IN PROGRAM MANAGEMENT? THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS WILL ALSO CONTINUE THE WORK WE BEGAN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. TO ACCESS CURRENT AND FUTURE LONG TERM CARE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA VETERANS. THAT ASSESSMENT WILL BE OVERLAID WITH AN ANALYSIS OF OUR CURRENT CAPABILITIES AND THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LEVELS. THE ASSESSMENT WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ABOUT WAIT LISTS FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CARE AND THE IMPACT OF THE NEW ADMISSION PRIORITIES THAT ARE VETERANS HOMES. TO OVERLY SIMPLIFY WE HOPE TO LEARN WITH GREATER CLARITY WHAT KIND OF LONG TERM CARE OUR VETERANS WILL NEED MOST. WHERE IN THE STATE THEY WILL NEED IT AND WHAT SERVICE GAPS ARE LIKELY TO EMERGE? FURTHERMORE. WE EXPECT THE PLANNING PROCESS TO ANSWER SUCH QUESTIONS AS. WILL THE LOCATION AND THE MIX OF LEVELS OF CARE OFFERED IN OUR CURRENT HOMES MEET THE PROJECTED NEEDS OF VETERANS FOR LONG TERM CARE. WHAT FISCAL IMPACT WILL RESULT FROM PRIORITIZING VOTE VETERANS WITH HIGHER DISABILITY RATINGS AND LEVELS OF FINANCIAL NEED? AND FINALLY WATER THE PROJECTED COSTS OF THE VARIOUS MODELS. THE EXISTING HOMES PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVOLUTION AS THE CHAIRMAN STATED. THESE MIGHT INCLUDE BRINGING TOGETHER IN ONE PLACE COMPLEMENTARY VETERAN SERVICES SUCH AS NONPROFIT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. VETERAN AN EMPLOYEE HOUSING AND OTHER VENTURES THAT COULD RESULT IN COST SAVINGS AND REVENUE GENERATION. OUR MASTER PLANNING SHOULD RESULT IN A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVES WHICH WE WILL PUT FORWARD FOR CONSIDERATION. ULTIMATELY I FORESEE THAT CALVET WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE OPTIMAL USE OF HOPE OF THE HOMES IN THE FUTURE. COLLECTIVELY WE WILL THEN HAVE THE NECESSARY POLICY POLICY DISCUSSIONS WHICH I HOPE WILL LEAD TO AN INFORMED CONSENSUS. IN I RECEIVED A DOZEN QUESTIONS FOR TO CONSIDER BEFORE TODAY'S HEARINGS. I READ THE MALL AND I WOULD SUMMARIZE MOST OF THEM THIS WAY. SECRETARY BASANTI IF THE MASTER PLAN RESULTS IN A RADICALLY DIFFERENT VERSION VISION OF THE HOMES. WOULD IT NOT BE BEST TO WAIT. FOR THAT FINAL VISION TO EMERGE BEFORE MAKING ANY. POTENTIAL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. SUCH AS A NEW SNIFF. QUESTION. MY IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WOULD BE THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO WAIT. IF THERE WERE NO VETERANS HOMES. AND IF THE HOMES ARCHITECTURE WERE BEING CREATED OPOVO FROM SCRATCH TODAY. AND MAPPED OUT UPON A FRESH BLANK PAGE WAITING WOULD IN FACT BE THE MOST PRUDENT COURSE OF ACTION. HOWEVER THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. WE'RE NOT STARTING WITH A TABULA RASA. YOUNG FELIZ FAR FROM A BLANK PAGE. SOME OF YOUNG FILLS FEATURES ALREADY EMBODIED DECADES EVEN A CENTURY OF ARCHITECTURAL TRADITIONS AND GROWTH. AND FURTHERMORE. SOME REPRESENT LARGE PRE EXISTING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS OR ARE THE SUBJECT OF LONG TERM LEASES. YES THERE'S A BOUNTY OF UNDEVELOPED SPACE ON THE CAMPUS ROOM FOR NEW IDEAS AND EVEN SOME ABILITY TO REPURPOSE EXISTING BUILDINGS. NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE OWN FILL CAMPUS LANDSCAPE WHICH AS A PRACTICAL MATTER ARE IMMUTABLE. AS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST FACILITY OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION THE ON FIELD VETERANS HOME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FLAGSHIP OF THE CALVERT SYSTEM. IT HAS PROVIDED CARE AND SERVICES IN AN ICONIC SETTING FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS. HOWEVER AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE VERY WELL AWARE THE CAMPUS HAS A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL CHALLENGES. THE BUILDINGS ARE OLD. THE INFRASTRUCTURE INEFFICIENT AND THE DESIGN REFLECTS BUILDING STANDARDS OF GENERATIONS PAST. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF THE YOUNG FILL STAFF. THE BUILDING WHICH IS HOME TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE VETERAN RESIDENTS ALSO HAS SERIOUS ACUTE AND COSTLY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ISSUE. THIS IS THE REALITY. SIMPLY PUT WE CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT WAIT FOR THE OUTCOME OF AN EXTENDED PRODUCT PLANNING PROCESS WHICH I AM CONVINCED THAT MY HEART WILL NOT DEVIATE FROM OUR PRE. PRESUPPOSITIONS BEFORE REPLACING THE EXISTING SNIFF BUILDINGS. HERE WE ARE TODAY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DISCUSSING THIS. WHAT CALVET RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE ANFAL CAMPUS AS FAR BACK AS TWO THOUSAND TWELVE? IT CONTRACTED THEN WITH AN ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING FIRM HELLMUTH OBATA AND KASSEBAUM TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM MASTER PLAN FOR THE PROPERTY. THIS MASTER PLAN RESULTED IN AN EXPERT. ROAD MAP HIGHLIGHTING THE MOST URGENT AND BENEFICIAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD BRING THE DOWNFALL CAMPUS TO ITS FULL POTENTIAL INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF THE SNIFF BUILDING. SO THE CURRENT BOLD BOTH THE CURRENT BUDGET IS THE FIRST TO SEEK APPROVAL FOR THIS NEW STAFF. THERE WERE ACTUALLY YEARS A PRIOR CALVET PLANNING WHICH LED TO THIS PCP. FINALLY AS THE GOVERNOR RECOGNIZED IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET A DELAY IN REPLACING THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WOULD BE A FAILURE TO PROVIDE THAT TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE FOR OUR VETERANS. AND WOULD BE A WASTE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. WHY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE MORE THAN EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS HAS BEENSENT SPENT ON MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS TO PATCH YOUNG FILLS ANTIQUATED FACILITIES? JUST TO KEEP THE HOME OPERATING. YES I'M PROUD THAT WE HAVE MANAGED TO PROVIDE FIVE STAR CARE USING PATCHWORK AND MAKESHIFT REPAIRS. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION. IN ADDITION TO THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE SNIFF REPLACEMENT. WE CANNOT IGNORE THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR MOST INDEPENDENT RESIDENTS. FOR THEIR WELL DESERVED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESIDENTS IN OUR DOMICILIARY PROGRAM MAY NOT REQUIRE ROUND THE CLOCK ATTENTION FROM OUR NURSES. BUT YOU DON'T FILL IS THEIR HOME AND THEY HAVE HEARD EARNS THE VERY BEST WE CAN OFFER. THE CURRENT DOMICILIARY BUILDING CONFIGURATION IS BUILT ON A MILITARY BARRACKS MODEL WHICH IS OUTDATED EVEN ON MODERN MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND WHICH CERTAINLY DOES NOT REFLECT THE STANDARDS WHICH GUIDE CONSTRUCTION OF A SIMILAR. LONG TERM BECAUSE A CARE FACILITY TODAY. TO THAT END WE HAVE PROPOSED MODIFYING OUR ROOM ASSIGNMENTS SO THAT EACH OF THESE RESIDENTS HAS HIS OR HER OWN ROOM. THIS IS MADE POSSIBLE IN PART BY A DROP IN THE DEMAND FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING. RECONFIGURING OUR INDEPENDENT LIVING BUILDINGS TO A SINGLE OCCUPANCY MODEL. REPRESENTS A CHANGE THAT IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE THAN A MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. YET MAKE NO MISTAKE IT WILL MEAN A WORLD OF IMPROVEMENT FOR THESE VALUED MEMBERS OF OUR HOME. I WANT TO NOTE THAT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THE DOMICILIARY SETTING WITH THEIR SPOUSES. AND THIS MOVE TOWARD SINGLE ROOMS WILL NOT AFFECT COUPLES. THE INITIATIVES FOR SNIFF AN INDEPENDENT LIVING THE BOOKENDS OF OUR LONG TERM CARE OFFERINGS CANNOT WAIT. OTHER REFINEMENTS AND EVOLUTIONS IN THE HOMES ARE CLEARLY NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR VETERANS. WE EMBRACE THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATES TO PLAN FOR THEM. WHERE ENCOURAGED BY THE WEALTH OF SUPPORT AND THE OUT POURING OF IDEAS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND BEYOND? AND WE KNOW THAT THE VAST DOWNFALL CAMPUS IN PARTICULAR OFFERS AN ABUNDANCE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR SENSIBLE AND FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THROUGH THE MASTER PLANNING PROCESS WE ARE EXPLORING A MULTITUDE OF IDEAS THAT ARE IN KEEPING WITH OUR MISSION. AND WHICH WOULD ALLOW CALVET TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES TO ALL VETERANS IN THE REGION. GIVEN ITS SIZE ITS LOCATION AND THE IMPRESSIVE DEGREE OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT. BEYOND FILL CAMPUS SHOW STRONG POTENTIAL FOR THESE TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS. AND OUR TOUCHSTONE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE ON FILL CAMPUS MUST BE USED TO SERVE VETERANS. THE VETERANS HOME OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY TURNING POINT IN THEIR HISTORY. WE'VE ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST AND BROUGHT FIVE NEW HOMES ONLINE WHILE PROVIDING EXCELLENT HEALTH CARE IN THE MEANTIME. NOW IS THE TIME TO PURSUE IDEAS FOR THE FUTURE. AND TO RECOMMIT TO INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA'S VETERANS FOR THE DECADES TO COME SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DISCUSSION THIS IS A VERY EXCITING TIME FOR CALL THAT. AN I ALONG WITH MY ENTIRE LEADERSHIP TEAM AND PROUD PLAY A ROLE IN ITS FUTURE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DOCTRINE BOSC YANNI AND. MY. COCHAIR LE THE CHAIR OF BUDGET SUB FOUR WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. THE OTHER MEMBERS EXECUTIVE MISTER SECRETARY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FOR CLOSE TING IT'S IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT HEARING. ON CALIFORNIANS VETERANS HOMES ISN'T A VETERAN ANOTHER ISSUES ALL TOO WELL. BOTH POLICY AND BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE HAVE IMPORTANT ROLE VENTURING THAT FUNDING WE HAVE THE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE STATE'S VETERANS. SPEND A MANNER AS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. LET FOUR TO WORKING ON THE VETERANS ISSUES AGAIN THIS YEAR THE BUDGET PROCESS. LESTER TOWARD THE ALPHA HOME WITH THE SECRETARY TODAY'S HEARING IS A GREAT PLACE TO BEGIN THE CONVERSATION IN BUDGET SUB FOR WILL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE BUDGET PROPOSALS. THAT SERVE OUR VETERANS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER DO WE HAVE QUESTIONS. IT'S CABALLERO IMAGE THIS ACTUALLY BE MAY BE MORE IN THAT IN THAT. FRAMEWORK OF A OF A OF IT STATEMENT BECAUSE I'M. I'M I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY. IT'S UP. TAPE THAT WOULD CLEAR TO ME THAT TIME YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT TIME. IN OUR REGION IN THEM IN THE THIRTIETH ES DE WE HAVE A HIGH NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT ARE HOMELESS. AND WE STRUGGLE WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THE SERVICES THEY MOST NEED AND WE HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD FACILITIES AND LOCATED IN IN MONTEREY COUNTY. BUT BUT I LOOK AT THE. I DID SOME MATH AND IT'S CLOSE TO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE LISTED ON OUR REPORT UP CLOSE TO SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR. THE RESIDENTIAL. FACILITY FOR THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR. INDIVIDUALS THAT LIVE IN AND I AM. IN THE HOUSING FOR SO IN THE HOUSE FACILITIES. MAY IT'S IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM IF WE IF WE HAD THE HOUSE ALL ONE POINT SEVEN ONE MILLION VETS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON WE'D HAVE TO USE THE ENTIRE STATE BUDGET IN ORDER TO DO THAT'S I GUESS. IT AS AS WE LOOK FORWARD I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING UP WHAT SOME OF THE ALTERNATIVES ARE. TO PROVIDING SERVICES AND IN A REALLY HOW COME WE DO THE MOST THAT WE CAN FOR VETERANS. WHO? WHO REALLY AREN'T HAVE GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY OF MOST? CITIZENS THAT LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY AND AND WE KNOW THAT THE MORE RECENT WARS HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE DEVASTATING. IT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ON THE RETURNING VETERAN SO I I GUESS MY. AB ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHETHER OTHER STATES DOING. ARE THEY. ARE THEY DOING A BETTER JOB OF OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO VETERANS IN NEED AND HOW CAN WHETHER THE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO IDENTIFY AND MAYBE THE REPORT WILL TELL US IN A IN A YEAR AND A HALF. WHERE WE OUGHT TO DEPLOY SOME OF OUR RESOURCES BUT I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LONG TERM? M. STRATEGY FOR HOUSING VETERANS AND THEN REALLY GETTING THEM BACK. AND INTEGRATED INTO SOCIETY. I THINK YOU'RE SOME OF OUR THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY BROAD QUESTION AND BY THE WAY I AM. YOU CAN INVITE ME BACK WELL IN ADVANCE OF THAT EIGHTEEN MONTH. DEADLINE TO GET PROGRESS REPORTS I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT ME POINT. BY. I AUTUMN. YOU'VE RACED. YOU'VE RAISED ONE MAJOR ISSUE WHICH IS VETERANS SERVICES WE HAVE ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION VETERANS. THANK THE GOOD LORD TO OF THEY ALL DO NOT REQUIRE CAL THAT'S ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR HOUSING AND WE HAVE A HOME MORTGAGE PROGRAM THERE ARE MANY SUCCESSFUL VETERANS OUT THERE. WHO DO NOT COME BACK? ANNA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED ARE THRIVING IN THE WORKPLACE THEY CAN APPLY FOR COMMERCIAL OR MORTGAGES ON WE ADDRESSED. CALVET ADDRESSES THE HOUSING. ISSUE. IN A VAST SPECTRUM IF YOU WILL FROM EVEN A EMERGING HOUSING THE VETERAN THAT NEEDS A HOW. A ROOF OVER HIS HEAD TONIGHT. IF WE CAN REACH THE VETERAN OF THE VETERAN CAN REACH ANYONE IN AUTHORITY. THERE IS A SYSTEM IN PLACE FROM OREGON TO THE MEXICAN BORDER THAT WILL GET A VETERAN INTO HOME OF A PLACE. TONIGHT WE HAVE. WE HAVE. WE CAN TAKE THEM IN FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME EITHER TRANSITIONAL. HOUSING OR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THEN WE GO ALL THE WAY ON UP THROUGH RENTAL HOUSING THROUGH HUD VOUCHERS AND AND SO ON. TOM. CHAU. A PROBLEM DE IT WOULD WITH SOME OF THE VETERANS THAT ARE HOMELESS IS THAT. WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE AND THEY DON'T REACH OUT TO US OR THEY REFUSE THE OFFER. SO. BUT WE HAVE CAPACITY THROUGH OUR IT NOT JUST IN CALVET BUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH JUSTIN Y. LOS ANGELES ALONE. THE SALVATION ARMY. IN ORANGE COUNTY IT WOULD BE GOOD WILL THERE ARE NETWORKS OF PLACES WILL WEAKEN HOUSE ANY HOMELESS VETERAN WHO PRESENTS TO US TODAY IN A SUSTAINABLE. MANNER. BUT YOUR OTHER ISSUE I I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA ASK HOW CAN WE SUSTAIN THE HOMES. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE. YOUR QUESTION IS THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE. WHY DO WE HAVE HOMES WE DON'T% HAVE HOMES BECAUSE WE LIKE TAKING CARE VETERANS IN OUR HOMES WE HAVE HOMES BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY THROUGH ITS POLICY ITS FOREIGN POLICY IN ITS MILITARIES POLICY? PUT YOUNG AMERICAN MEN AND WOMEN IN HARM'S WAY THEY COME BACK BROKEN IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PHYSICALLY OR MENTALLY. IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO BORE THE BATTLE WE DON'T WANT TO DO IT IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO DO IT. THE VETERANS HOMES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION HAVE AN EXTRAORDINARY SPECIAL TALENT OUR HOMES ARE NOT ORDINARY NURSING HOMES WE CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT. THE THE OUR VETERANS IN THE HOMES HAVE SOMETIMES FAILED AT OTHER NURSING HOMES HAVE BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE BECAUSE. THEIR PARTICULAR. NEEDS AS A VETERAN ARE NOT IT THESE ARE FOR PRIMORDIAL NEEDS ARE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED. THE VETERANS HOME IT YOUNTVILLE HAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERTISE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THOSE PEOPLE. BUT YES ASSEMBLY MARK THE MEDICAL CARE FOR VETERANS IS EXPENSE OF. AND A LOT OF MY BUDGET GOES TO TAKE CARE OF A FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. WHEN THEY'RE SO MANY OTHER VETERANS WE ARE DEVELOPING OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE CAL TECH THE TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM THAT WILL. MASSIVELY AUGMENT MY ABILITY TO REACH AND PROVIDE SERVICES AND CONNECT VETERANS TO SERVICES FOR THE OTHER ONE POINT SIX NINE FIVE MILLION VETERANS. A WHO DON'T NEED HOUSING BUT FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE THE DESTITUTE THE ALONE THE HOMELESS. THE PEOPLE WITH NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD WHO A. WE HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM THAT COMES WITH A PRICE TAG IT'S A PRICE OF EVERY STATE THE UNION IS WILLING TO PAY. YOUR QUESTION WAS SO BRED BUT I HOPE I CHIPPED AWAY AT CORNERS OTHER I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE MISSION AND I APPRECIATE. THE THE THE THE THE HOMES AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY DO I GUESS WHAT I WAS GETTING TO IS. IS THAT I I'VE I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK RUN HOMELESS ISSUE AND. IT'S NEWS TO ME THAT ANY VETERAN ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK CAN GET. A SHELTER SO SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT THAT THAT'S NEWS TO ME AND MAYBE I CAN TAKE IT BACK TO RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE WE. WE STRUGGLE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO SHOW THEM THAT'S INCUMBENT ON US I NEED TO EDUCATE EVERYONE IN THE STATE WHAT THAT NETWORK IS IF I COULD IF I COULD INSTANTLY HAVE A TWO ONE ONE SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. WHERE YOU CAN CALL THAT SYSTEM AND SAY I NEED FOOD AND YOU'RE DIRECTED TOWARD US FOOD STAMP PROGRAM I NEED HOUSING I NEED A JOB? IF I CAN EXPORT THAT TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOMEBODY WHO SAID I NEED A ROOF OVER MY HEAD TODAY WOULD BE DIRECTED TO THEIR LOCAL COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICER. THEIR LOCAL LINK WE HAVE EIGHT EMPLOYEES OF MY AGENCY WHO SORT OF SHEPHERD LARGE NUMBERS OF CANDIES ARM AND WHO ARE PHYSICALLY RESPONSIVE. DURING THE FIRES EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODS IT'S OUR LINKS MCV ESOS FROM THE COUNTIES WHO GO INTO THE MUD AND INTO THE ASHES AND MAKE SURE THAT LEAST THE VETERANS. HAVE SUPPORT AND HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD BUT IT. A WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OR WHAT OF THE LINES OF CONNECTION TO HELP. I CAN HELP WITH THAT RIGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE REALLY I THINK VERY GOOD IN AND THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE IT JUST REALLY HAS TO DO WITH. WHERE WHERE THERE? UNMET NEEDS AND WHERE THERE ACCESS RESOURCES AND AND I DON'T MEAN EXCESS RESOURCES IN HIS AS IN WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED THEM AT THAT PARTICULAR. PLACE BUT WHERE THERE ARE BEDS UNUSED. THAT COULD BETTER BE USED RE PURPOSED UP AND AND AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL YEAH. THAT'S THAT'S CRUCIAL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR A MASTER PLAN NOT JUST FROM MY ENTIRE SYSTEM OF HOMES BUT FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMES. WE NEED TO START ASKING DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT SERVICES ARE THEY IN THE RIGHT PLACE FOR EXAMPLE WE HEAR FROM VENTURA COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY PARTICULARLY WE NEED MORE MEMORY CARE FOR THE VETERANS IN THOSE AREAS OKAY. DULY NOTED ARMED BUT DE ARE THE HOMES IN THE RIGHT PLACES. BOB AND I I HAVE A HARD TIME FILLING. FILLING THE BEDS IN ONE HOME I HAVE EXTRAORDINARY DIFFICULTY RITA WHO. RECRUITING AND RETAINING HELP DOCTORS NURSES THERAPISTS PHARMACISTS IN SEVERAL OF THE HOMES BECAUSE EITHER OF GEOGRAPHICAL CHALLENGES OR THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AND LET'S SAY IT LOS ANGELES AND NAPA COUNTY. WHERE ENTRY LEVEL CAL THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE TO LIVE AT GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE WORKPLACE? RIGHT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER. PHONE OBAMA'S GABRIELLE'S QUESTION WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE OF SERVING OUR VETERANS. THE GREATEST NEEDS BUT ALSO PROVIDING SERVICES THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MEMBERS. HOW DISEASE BALLOTS BEING REFLECTED IN THE MASTER PLAN? REPLIED THE GREATEST. S. ARE HIP IT'S WASN'T DOING FAR BETTER IF THE GREATEST NEEDS BUT ALSO PROVIDING SERVICES TO THE GREATEST NUMBER OF MEMBERS. WELL I AGREE AS I A GONNA START BY SAYING I THINK I THINK THE GOOD LORD THAT WE'D THAT NOT EVERY VETERAN IN CALIFORNIA NEED IS DESTITUTE. SO MANY OF THEM ARE LEAVING SUCCESSFUL LIVES IN THEIR JOBS AND A AND THAT THEY DON'T NEED HOUSING. BUT ALL OF THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT THEY FOUGHT FOR AND THEY EARNED WE DON'T GIVE THEM ANY BENEFIT THAT THEY HAVEN'T EARNED. EDUCATION HOUSING. JOB AYE. SECURITY EMPLOYMENT TRAINING. THAT'S ALL OF AN ASPECT OF THE CORE WORK OF OUR AGENCY WHICH IS. OUTREACH TO VETERAN SERVICES TO CONNECT VETERANS WITH THOSE BENEFITS. AND TO HELP THEM OVERCOME OBSTACLES WHETHER THEY HAPPEN TO HAVE A HARD TIME BECOMING A CITIZEN WHICH THEY THOUGHT WAS AUTOMATIC AFTER THE MILITARY SERVICE. WHETHER THEY ARE INCARCERATED THAN EXPECTED TO GET OUT IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. WHETHER THE WRITTEN A DIVERSION COURT WHETHER THEY ARE A MEMBER OF OF AN ISOLATED MINORITY OR JUST ISOLATED ALPINE OR DESERT COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY ARE NATIVE AMERICAN AN ISOLATED ON. NATIVE AMERICAN HOMELANDS SO WHERE. WHO WE ARE THROUGH OUR CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH JUST WAS BORN THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE'S AND PUT LAST YEAR AND IS JUST? FIRST BUDS ARE STARTING TO OPEN THE FIRST CURRICULUM IS BEING DEPLOYED WE ARE AND NOW HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN. AT SOME PENDLETON WHERE THREE HUNDRED MARINES LEAVE MILITARY SERVICE EVERY SINGLE MONTH WHERE THERE EVERY SINGLE MONTH NOW TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR BENEFITS BEFORE THEY TAKE THEIR UNIFORM OFF. WERE JUST NOW GOING TO VANDENBERG MARCH AIR FORCE BASE WILL FOLLOW SO WILL THE NAVY BASES AND SAN DIEGO AND THEN THROUGH. A CONCERT AT THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE LIBRARY SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO EXPORT THIS EVEN TO MORE REMOTE COMMUNITIES WHERE EVERY VETERAN CAN CONNECT THAT. WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB REACHING THE OTHER ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION. IT'S MORE QUESTION CALVET HAS SIGNIFICANT ASSETS SPECIAL YOUNTVILLE. AS FAR AS OPTIONS INCREASE REVENUE WHEELER SOME LEASES THAT YA'LL BILL THAT MAYBE ARE SO FAVORABLE CAL THAT. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE STRUCTURED THROUGH SECRECY FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THOSE? A GOOD QUESTION. I IT'S IT'S NO SECRET DUBBED I. READ SOME OF THE LEASES ON. RELATED TO THE EIGHT ACTIVITIES THAT GO ON ON THE OF VETERANS CAMPUS OF THEIR IN. THEIR WHAT TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS OLD. THERE WHAT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER UNFAVORABLE TERMS TO THE VETERANS AT CAL THAT. AT A DOUG ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH THIS SERIES OF HEARINGS I'M WORKING WITH MY LAWYERS TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THOSE LEASES AND SEE IF WE CAN MAXIMIZE OUR INFLUENCE. TO SEE IF WE'RE GETTING. THE BEST. OF BENEFIT WE CAN. FROM THE LEASES. I. A PARTNERSHIP WAS MADE WITH THE ENTITIES THAT CAME ON TO THE CAMPUS. PARTLY. LET'S I HAVE TO BE HONEST PART OF THE REASON THAT THERE THERE IS THEY CAN AFFORD TO BE THERE AND THEY DO OFFER BENEFITS. SOME TO OUR VETERANS AND SOME CLEARLY TO THE MUCH LARGER NAPA COMMUNITY. BOB. SOME OF THEM RIGHT NOW SO INTEGRATED THAT THE BASEBALL FIELD THE SWIMMING POOL THE NAPA MUSEUM THE. THE FIFTH THE LINCOLN THEATER THERE NOW INTERCULTURAL IT'S OF THE. THERE THE WOLFEN WHARF OF THE FABRIC OF THAT COMMUNITY SO I I I. I TREAD CAREFULLY BUT I DO NEED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS OF THE VETERANS. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO ASK WHAT OTHER OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT THERE BE IN THE FUTURE FOR NEW REVENUE GENERATION AT THE CAMPUS AND. AWARE OF THE MASTER PLAN IS GOING TO HELP THE SPECIFIC MASTER PLAN IS GOING TO HELP ME ARM. LOOK INTO THAT. MORE CAREFULLY. WHERE IN THE PROCESS OF MANY DISCUSSIONS SOME OF WHICH I FEEL A LITTLE AWKWARD BECAUSE THEIR PRELIMINARY? WE'VE MADE SITE VISITS AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO SISTER AGENCIES THAT HAVE INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN PARTNERSHIPS WITHOUT NONPROFITS AND THE COMMUNITY. SO WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT THE. THEY HELP US. MORE. IN LOOKING INTO THAT. HOME. PUT. I AGREE THERE IS AN UNTAPPED I WOULD SAY VAST BUT AN UNTAPPED POTENTIAL FOR REVENUE GENERATION. THINKS THE LEGISLATURE'S HELP HIM. JIGGLING AROUND OUR ADMISSIONS CRITERIA WHERE WE NOW FAVOR THOSE WHO LOST MORE ON THE BATTLEFIELD AS PRIORITIZE ATION FOR ADMISSION. THAT WILL ENHANCE FEDERAL PER DIEM REVENUE TO US. AND. AND I THINK. YES RIGHT THANK YOU THE OTHER YOU ALSO. HELPED ME MANDATE THAT ALL VETERANS HAVE FEDERAL STATE OR PERSONAL INSURANCE. ARM. ADD TO MAXIMIZE REVENUE. SO I EXPECT TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. WHEN I CAME IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO WE WERE RECOUPING THIRTY SIX CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON LOW. CHAIR AND I CERTAINLY WANT THAT NUMBER TO GO NORTH. I THINK SEVENTY PERCENT IS PROBABLY AN UNREALISTIC. GOAL BUT GETTING CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT MIGHT NOT BE UNREALISTIC. HA ONE STATE NEW YORK STATE. ES MAKES A PROFIT ON ITS VETERANS HOME BUT ONLY BY RESTRICTING ADMISSION TO THOSE WITH SEVENTY PERCENT OR GREATER DISABILITY. AND I THINK IF WE WERE TO DO THAT. I'M SORRY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACADEMIC CAN HEAR THIS LAST REMARK WE WOULD. WE WOULD HAVE TO NOT ACCEPT. HOMELESS AND THINK ABOUT THIS FOR EVERY HOMELESS BED I TAKEN TO. IN INTO SHELTER AT YOUNTVILLE OR ANY OF MY HOMES YOU DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE ASSETS THAT I CAN TAP INTO FOR THE COST OF THEIR CARE. IF THEY HAVE THOSE KIND OF ASSETS THEY WOULDN'T BE HOMELESS. SO I'M CAUGHT BETWEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE THERE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MET MATHIS. THE CHAIR. DOCTOR VIA I I'VE GOT TO GO BACK WITH THE HOME. PART OF WHAT ASSEMBLY WILL. MEMBER CAVALERA WAS SANE. THERE ANY EFFORTS BEING DOWN BY CAL THAT BEGIN TO TRACK COUNTY VETERANS ARE COUCH SURFING AS AS FAR AS THE HOMELESSNESS ON THAT SIDE. YES HOMELESSNESS ISN'T IS BEING OUT ON THE STREET A LOT OF IT'S YOU KNOW THEY. ARE STATE WANT FRIENDS HOUSE AND THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT THERE SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO THEIR EFFORTS BEING DONE AT ALL ON THAT AVENUE. IN LIKE YOU SAID WE WE HAVE A HOMELESS POPULATION HAVE A HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM IN THE STATE. THAT I KNOW A LOT OF US. A LOT OF THE MEMBERS ON AND BOTH HOUSES ARE WORKING TOWARDS SOLVING THE STATE HOMELESS PROBLEM. AND DID TO THE COMMENT MADE OF YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME HOMELESS. VETERANS OUT THERE THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON OF KINDA FALLEN OFF THE TRACKS AND MAY NOT BE ACTUALLY TAPPING INTO THEIR BENEFITS AND I'VE SEEN MANY CASES. WITH THAT MY PASSED OUT BEFORE BEING ELECTED WITH MY SIX YEARS WORKING IN VETERANS ADVOCACY. HOW IT WE SAW A LOT OF CASES OF THAT WHERE SOMEBODY DIDN'T KNOW OF A BENEFIT THAT THEY HAD? OR AS THINGS CHANGE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL NEW BENEFITS BECOME AVAILABLE. AND IF YOU HAVE A VETERAN THAT'S BEEN HOMELESS FOR A WHILE THEY MAY NOT KNOW OF THOSE CHANGES FOR. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WE REACH OUT TO THEM AND MAKE SURE. WELL THAT'S BEING DONE AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THREE QUESTIONERS COULD BUT WE START WITH THAT ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATH AND THANK YOU OF COURSE FOR YOUR YOUR SERVICE. IF HE AYE. WHERE TO START? I HAVE I HAVE PEOPLE THAT YOU. THE KEY TO THE ANSWER IS IN YOUR FINAL A SENTENCE REACH OUT ARM. WE DON'T KNOW EVERY VETERAN WHO EVERY VETERAN IS IN CALIFORNIA OUR ESTIMATE OF ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION COMES IT SAID WELL GROUNDED ESTIMATED COMES FROM THE THE DOD AND THE THE THE SERVICES BRANCHES AND OUR. OUR OWN INTERNAL A LOT OF PEOPLE SELF IDENTIFY. THERE'S NO WAY TO IDENTIFY LGBT VETERANS UNLESS THEY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES TO US IN OUR QUESTIONNAIRES. ARM. HOMELESS VETERANS. IF THEIR COUCH SEARCHING ARE WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING CALIFORNIA JUST COMPLETED IT'S A WHAT WE CALL A POINT AND KEPT THEM. THANK YOU THE POINT TOWN SURVEY JUST A LAST WEEK. WHERE PEOPLE GO OUT UNDER EVERY? BUT. FOR ALL THE SHANTY TOWNS AND OF THE TENT CITIES AND THE UNDER PASSES AND THE BACKYARD CHEN AND FIND HOMELESS PEOPLE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREET. AND THE THEY TRY TO GET SOME DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OUT OF THEM INCLUDING THE QUESTION HAVE YOU EVER SERVED. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE A WAY TO KNOW IF ANYONE IS COUCH SURFING OR EVEN HOW MANY HOMELESS VETERANS THERE ARE. UNTIL THAT DATA COMES IN EVERY YEAR AND IS. OF REFORM. REFINED. DAWN BUT EVEN THAT WHICH. WE ALWAYS SEEM TO DO A BETTER JOB EVEN IN EDUCATING OUR VETERANS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY WOMEN VETERANS SAY TO ME I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS A VETERAN I'M A WOMAN. OR HOW MANY PEOPLE OF EITHER GENDER SAY I WAS NEVER WOUNDED HOW CAN I BE A VETERAN IT IT'S IT SPEAKS TO A PROFOUND IGNORANCE OF YOUR STATUS ANYTIME YOU'RE BENEFITS BUT. SO SO WAIT WITH THAT. THIS PAST YEAR WE PASSED. LEGISLATION TO START TRACKING THE TWENTY TWO A DAY. WITH THE VETERANS SUICIDE IS ARE WE IN ANY NUMBERS. AND ON THAT YEAH AND WHAT IS THE SYSTEM WE HAVE IN PLACE IT BEGAN. GATHERING THAT DATA. BOB WELL OF I I WASN'T ACTUALLY PARA TO GO VERY MUCH OUTSIDE THE HOMES BUT. LIFE AND DEATH ISSUES TAKE PRIORITY ARMED SHOWED. IT IS NOW HERE SO YOU KNOW IT'S NOW LEGISLATION I THINK OF AS ANYONE CAN HELP ME ON THIS I THINK. A NEW LAW SAYS THAT DEATH CERTIFICATES WILL NOW LIST. WHETHER THE DECEDENT WAS A VETERAN. YES THOSE THAT TENT AND THAT WILL BE ONE WAY FOR US TO SEE. SOME WICKED SEX SCANDAL ALL SUICIDES ARE ALL PEAK PTSD RELATED OR ALL AGENT ORANGE. TESTS AND GET A GET A BETTER IDEA. OF. OF THAT. OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T HAVE A. I DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE THAT WAS A DEDICATED THEIR SON ON. WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO TRACK THAT? AND THEN AS WELL AS ALSO LAST YEAR YOU YOU'D MENTIONED. VETERANS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR CITIZENSHIP STATUS IS IN AND THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAD WORKED ON LAST YEAR. WAS FOR OUR VETERANS THAT HAD SERVED ADDED VAN NOW. HONORABLY DISCHARGED NEED FALLEN THROUGH THAT CRACK RIGHT. SIR IS THERE ANYTHING YOU GUYS ARE YEAH I WAS SO I I'M VERY I'M FIT SINCE WE HAVE YOU HERE MILLIONS IT IT'S GREAT I'M VERY BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO. I'M VERY HAPPY THAT HAVE TO BE THE SECRETARY OF THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT NOT JUST. YEAH. DEPUTY PETERSON'S PART OF IT UP WE JUST. FILLED OUR OUR LAST. EMPTY A LEADERSHIP POSITION AT CALVET BY LIZ PEREZ WHO MAY BE IN THE ROOM IS NOW THE OTHER NEW A DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR UNDER REPRESENTED A MINORITY VETERANS. AND THAT NOT ONLY ARE ALL THE ETHNIC. SUBGROUPS AND THE NATIVE AMERICAN AND THE LGBT. BUT IT'S ALSO OF THE HOME A. THE. NOT DOCUMENTED. OR. SO IF SHE IS JUST SHOWN ME YESTERDAY A PROPOSAL WHERE SHE WILL START IT'S GOING TO START IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY I THINK. WITHIN THE MONTH. A PUBLIC MEETING WHERE ANYONE WHO'S HAVING CITIZENSHIP ISSUES ANY VETERAN AND THEIR FAMILY CAN CALM AND WE WILL PROVIDE A LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY HEALTH TO STE. START THAT PROCESS BECOMING RIGHT AGAIN. S. B. AGAIN FOR FURTHER PROGRESS REPORT. A WE WILL. THANK YOU. GOOD TO SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU SECRETARY ENJOYMENT OF FOR BEING HIS AFTERNOON. I'M LOOKING AT TRY TO KEEP IN THE LANE OF THE HOMES. THE. THAT THE GRAPH THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US WITH REGARD TO THE NUMBER OF BEDS CAPACITY VERSES BUDGET IT IS A FIVE HUNDRED BAD DIFFERENCE THAT'S THERE. AS CHRIS ABOUT UTILIZATION SO YOU HAVE TWO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY. BUDGET THAT THE WATCHER ACTUALIZATION CENTER SO MUCH DISCUSSION OF. UNDER UTILIZATION BUT NOT ACTUAL NUMBER OF BEDS DURING THESE. SURE. I'M COKIE PETERSON DEBBIE SECTOR VETERANS HOMES THE. OBVIOUSLY THOUGH AT ONE POINT TIME. BEFORE I GOT HERE WE WERE SUBJECT TO BUDGET DOES COULD CRUNCH WHICH I THINK PUT SOME. SOME OF THOSE CAPACITY NUMBERS IN SUSPENSE. OBVIOUSLY THAT WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES IN OUR OLDER HOMES NOT PRIMARILY. FILL IN BARSTOW TO FILL. A EVEN BUDGETED. CAPACITIES FOR SAY OUR ICF FOR OUR OR OUR OR DOMICILIARY INDEPENDENT LIVING SO. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY. IT IS A CONCERN OF OURS AND WE SEE THAT. THAT ONCE WE GET. CONFIRMATION OF A MASTER PLAN IN TERMS OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR THE FUTURE GOING FORWARD. WILL REASSESS THAT OBVIOUSLY IF THERE'S A IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPURPOSE THAT SPACE. A IT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CONSIDER SENSE ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PATH NOW. OF OF LOOKING AT OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW PHIL. AS WELL AS BARSTOW AND THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN AREAS THAT THAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES WITH CAPACITY AND AND VERSES BUDGETED SO. AGAIN THAT THERE WAS A REASON FOR IT AND THEN THERE'S JUST NO DEMAND WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THOSE SO WHAT WILL WILL GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT WE CONTINUED LOOK AT THAT SO YOU KNOW I FIGURE YOU CAN GO TO. NOW NOT NOT TODAY BUT I CAN GET YOU AN ANSWER YEAH I'D BE CURIOUS WITH THE DELTA IS ON THAT JUST BECAUSE ACTUALLY IF THERE'S CAPACITY YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO SEE IT THERE BUT NOW YOU KNOW BUT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW I'M I'M DOWN A HUNDRED. AND TWENTY TWO DOMICILIARY IN YOUNTVILLE OKAY. TWENTY SEVEN ICF AND THAT'S JUST ON BUDGET NUMBERS. IT'S ALREADY OFF THE TOP OF OUR BUDGET NUMBERS AND WELL BELOW OUR BUDGET NUMBERS WHICH PUTS US WELL BELOW OUR CAPACITY FOR. AND THAT'S WHAT RANDY GET AT YEAH SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WHAT WE BUILT A WHAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU MONEY FOR. WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY USING SCISSORS TWENTY DISCUSSION ABOUT NOT SIZE OF OUR QUESTION ABSOLUTELY AND WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT CONSIDERATION AND THEN? WHAT WOULD BE THE CALL I MEAN? AGAIN I KNOWLEDGE IS A MASTER PLAN IS HOLDING GOING ON PETROLEUM ARMS AROUND WHAT A I THINK THERE IS THE STATUS OF THEIR SUMMER MENTIONED ABOUT SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS A PER BED. IS THAT RIGHT SO IS ABOUT MY WOULD SIT I WOULD SUSPECT THAT SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THE LEVEL OF SKILL. THAT'S NEEDED YOU KNOW THAT INDEPENDENT LIVING ISN'T SEVENTY ONE GRAN ARE CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS SO SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S COSTS. THE TOTAL COST OF CARE BASED ON THE LEVEL OF CARE IN YOUR MORE INDEPENDENT LEVELS CARE NOT AS EXPENSIVE. AND YOUR HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE MORE EXPENSIVE SO ON READING ARE RC A FEE LEVEL OF CARES ABOUT A. HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY IN THE SKILLED NURSING IN REDDING IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY AND YOU CALCULATE THAT OUT. OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IT COST TO BE AN RC A FEW WHAT ACOSTA BE INNOCENT HAVE. NOW THE RESIDENTS AS YOU KNOW BASED ON ON ON OUR. VETERANS KOBE SOME STATUTE ARE ARE REQUIRED PAPER PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME BASED UPON THE LEVEL OF CARE. THEY'RE ALSO OFFSET WITH PER DIEM FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT ESSENTIALLY GETS US TO A POINT WHERE THERE'S THERE'S A DELTA. WHERE THE TAXPAYERS? HAVE. GRACIOUSLY. MADE UP THE DIFFERENCE OBVIOUSLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. OR TRY TO BE VERY FISCALLY PRUDENT WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE LOOKING. YOU KNOW THIS LAST BUDGET CYCLE WE INTRODUCED THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE INSURANCE. WILL HELP TO FOR COSTS OF CARE. WERE ALSO IT WE INSERTED THE AT THE ADMISSIONS FOCUS ON THE ONES THAT HAVE SERVED THE MOUSE ARE GIVEN THE MOST SEVENTY PERCENTERS THEY GET ENHANCE PER DIEM OF ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY SO YOU CAN SEE. THE MORE SEVENTY PERCENTERS WE HAVE. A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR DAYBED. THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE SURE. AND OF COURSE WHERE WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STANDARD STANDARDIZE ACROSS ALL OF THE HOMES ARE IN CAPTURE MEDICARE DOLLARS FOR PARTY PARTY PARTY. AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE IN IN ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR ELIGIBLE FOLKS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID AND. IN ATTENDANCE. THAT WE GET THEM ENROLLED AND I THINK A COMBINATION OF ALL THOSE EFFORTS WILL GIVE US MUCH CLOSER TO WHAT THE SECRETARY WAS SAYING ONE IT SAID. SENATE COVERING ONE THIRD MAYBE WE CAN GET A LITTLE OVER HALF. A SOME STATES LIKE TO DO JUST SEVENTY PERCENT OR SOME STATES LIKE TO DO JESS MEDICAID SOME STATES LIKE TO MAKE IT PAY WHAT IT COSTS AND SO IT'S A DISCUSSION THAT CERTAINLY WE ARE WELL AWARE OF AND. WE KEEP LOOKING AT WELL AS WHAT TO RESPOND IN KNOWING WHAT YOUR ACTUAL UTILIZATION. PASSED THE BUDGET BUT ACCOUNT FOR UTILIZATION WATCHER AT JUST GENERAL I REALIZE THAT FLUCTUATES PIE BY THE HOUR FRANKLY. FIRMS ARE ALSO UNDERSTANDING. WHAT WHAT IS IT FROM A BUDGET PASSING ME WHAT IF WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO FULLY COME UTILIZE YOUR CAPACITY RIGHT I REALIZE IT'S NOT REALLY A MARK CONCERN RIGHT NOW? BUT AS WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW HAS LEGISLATORS UNDERSTANDING OUR RESPONSIBILITIES UP FUND YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO GET YOU TO FOR. A TWO THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED FIFTY. I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF OF YOU KNOW MAKING. BALLOTS ARE CASH FLOW OR WHAT HAVE YOU AND I LOVED AT THE POLICY DISCUSSION PROBABLY AT A LATER DATE AFTER THE MASTER PLAN UNDERSTAND IT DO WE WANT TO BE A SEVENTY PERCENT ARE ONLY STATE OR DO WE WANT TO GO A DIFFERENT WAY. I'M I GUESS THAT CONCERNED I HAD AFTER REVIEWING THESE MATERIALS LAST NIGHT WAS IT THERE ARE UNOCCUPIED BEDS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT CHILDRESS IS A REALLY HAVE THIS PROBLEM RIGHT AND WHERE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THAT FABULOUS FACILITY I IN IN MY IN MANY NUYS NECK OF THE. WOODS ASIDE TO JONATHAN'S ANTES NECK OF THE WOODS ARMED. BUT IT I REALIZE THAT THAT'S NOT THE SAID THE CASE IN OTHER PLACES BUT. A CERTAIN EXPLAINED ANY TAXPAYER THAT WE HAVE ON UTILIZED ASSETS. IS DIFFICULT TO IS A DIFFICULT MESSAGE TO SHARE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE GOOD AND REAL REASONS WHY THAT'S THE CASE BUT WE NEED TO FLIP THAT AROUND. REALLY IN LIGHT OF HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND SAME SECRETARY ABOUT THAT THERE ARE BEDS AVAILABLE I RECOGNIZE OF THE FROM MOTIVATED VETERANS THEY'D THAT'S PROBABLY THE CASE. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE PLENTY TO GO I'M SHELTERED OF EVERY NIGHT AND I'LL Y. CAN REPRESENT THAT EVERY A HOMOSEXUAL AND MOVED BARSTOW. I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT THEY CAN GET THEIR OR THEY'D BE UTILIZED I READ THE MATERIALS UNDERSTAND THAT COMES A HIGHER LEVEL OF SKILL PUBLICLY MORE MONEY. ON BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS WHAT IT IS SIR I'M SORRY YET KNOW IT SON I'M BE MORE TALK ABOUT IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THEY WERE PROUD TO SAY IS THAT THAT WE WENT BACK AND WE LOOK. AT THE NUMBERS WE THE I BELIEVE IT WAS THIRTY PERCENT OF LAST YEAR'S ADMISSIONS WHERE WERE HOMELESS VETERANS ACROSS ALL OF OUR VETERANS HOMES. AND AS YOU KNOW WITH THE TEACH PEOPLE WOMAN WEST LA THAT'S NO LONGER OPERATING BUT WE WE GO OUT OF OUR WAY WE WE WERE CONSTANTLY GETTING PHONE CALLS FROM FOLKS THAT SAY HEY WE HAVE A VET DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR THEM AND. TYPICALLY ARE OPENINGS RIGHT NOW OUR BARSTOW AND AND I AND SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES YOUNTVILLE MOSTLY BARSTOW CHULA VISTA FOR SOME REASON IS IS CORNERED THE MARKET ON DOM NOT SO THERE'S NEVER BEDS AVAILABLE THERE BUT. WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THOSE NUMBERS WILL GO DOWN IN THERE MAYBE. A NEED TO REPURPOSE ALSO TAUGHT FOR HOMELESS WILL CERTAINLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PASSING TERMS OF BIHAC PARA ON THIS IS MY SOME OF MY PAST LIFE. LIKE I'VE ONLY BEEN TO THREE OF THE VETERANS ON I MEAN ALL OF THEM MY SUSPICION IS THAT YOU COULD WORK CLOSELY WITH SOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO. YIELD UNITS. AND A REVENUE STREAM QUITE FRANKLY I'M AND YOU KNOW WHY I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FROM OF MY COLLEAGUE REPRESENTS NAPA IMAGINE THOSE CULTURAL AMENITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE VERY POINT THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THINK YOU'RE HARD PRESSED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT THOSE ARE SOMEHOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE CARE OF OUR VETERANS I'M. AND SO A KNOWING THAT LAND IS OFTEN THE BIGGEST DRIVER OF. WHETHER OUR PROJECT AND WORK OR NOT WORK THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN BE HAVE GOOD NEIGHBORS I REALIZE ARE NOT COMPLETELY BUILT AND IS ANOTHER PART IT'S AVAILABLE AT RITUALISTIC. YOU KNOW MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL HOUSING. IN THE IN THE MARKET SEGMENTS THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER SUBSCRIBE SO I'M I JUST HOPE THAT THAT SOME SECURITY TEND TO DO THAT THE BEING IS ON JUNE OR ELSE POSSIBLE. A TO GET TO THE. TO THE POINT THAT WITH FULL LEGALIZATION AYE THAT YOU LIKE WE CAN ASK US FOR MORE MONEY AND AND YOU COULD USE IT. AND. THAT WHEN NATURALLY EVERY VETERAN WHO NEEDS IT GETS THE SERVICE AND CERTAINLY THAT NO VETERAN EVER GOES HOMELESS OF. APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS STATE A SECRETARY AND UP FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM. AND CERTAINLY HAVE A PARTNER HERE DO WHATEVER WE CAN ATTEND. HELP YOU AS YOU GOT THIS MASTER PLAN PROCESS THANK YOU THINK AMERICA'S FAVORITE AND AND AND I I MAYBE YOU CAN JUST BRIEFLY MENTION WHAT HAPPENED AND INVENTOR OF THE. LAND RIGHT NEXT TO THE HOME WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN BACK TO THE CITY BLOOM CITY HAS AN RFP OUT TO DEVELOP OF VETERANS HOUSING SO THAT IS HAPPENING AT SOME OF THE OTHER HOMES SO. THEY GIVE UP THE BUT THE ASSET. WELL THE CITY WAS GOING TO GET IT BACK IN THE MONEY TWENTY ONE A IF WE DID NOT BUILD OR EXPAND THE PRESENT TO RC A FEE OF SIXTY BEDS THERE. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE LAND WOULD HAVE REVERTED BUT. IT WOULD WE DECIDED WE WEREN'T GOING TO SO WHY SHOULD WE SETTLE AND WHEN THEY. A VERY WHAT I PARTICULARLY WANTED TO START BUILDING A VETERAN CENTRIC. HOUSING PROJECT OUT NOW SO BEFORE THAT PROP FORTY ONE FUND RAN OUT. WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET THE MONEY BACK TO THE CITY AND AND. I WAS ONE OF THEIR TOP PRIORITIES I I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OF VETERANS ARE GOING TO BE HOUSE THERE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY HAS HAPPENED AT OTHER HOMES WITH. THAT HAVE EXCESSIVE UP PROPERTY SO STILL FURTHERING VETERANS NEEDS. BUT YOU'LL GET THE ACID ON THE BOOKS AT BECAUSE I LIKE WAS OURS TO BE ENDLESSLY YEAH I'M JUST GONNA COME IN MY NAME ST GERARD ASSISTANT DEPUTY SECRETARY ON THE TWO PROPOSALS THAT. VENTURA HAS PUT FORWARD ARE BEING ACT. EVALUATED TOMORROW AND I BELIEVE THE NUMBERS ARE ONE TO TWO HUNDRED. ONE PROPOSAL IS A HUNDRED THE OTHERS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED. FOR LOW INCOME. VETERAN HOUSING AND IT JUST RIGHT BEHIND THE FACILITY SO. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT IT IS IS IN LINE WITH OUR MISSION. AND WE WE ARE PARTICIPATORY AND AND WHAT THAT END RESULT WILL BE. GREAT. A ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND. MR SECRETARY IN YOUR STAFF I REALLY DO APPRECIATE AYE AYE I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR FOUR YEARS AND. SINCE YOU'RE NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM IS COMING I'VE SEEN A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE. IN. SUSTAINING. THE. GOOD LIFE OF A VETERAN AND EVE WHEN YOU'VE MADE. MAKE SOME BOUNDS. I TOWARDS THAT END AND I WILL HAVE TO TELL YOU MEN CHAIR THAT. THE SECTARIAN I HAD. A DISCUSSION ABOUT A NATIVE AMERICAN INDIAN VETERANS. AND THIS MAN WENT TO RESERVATIONS TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW WE CAN BE MORE EFFECTIVE. SO HE CAN YOU GIVE HIM A PROBLEM HE DOES GO OUT AND PLAY. TRIED BROUGHT HOME PROVIDE THE SOLUTION. SO BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE THIS LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION CAME THROUGH IN AND. WHAT YOU SEE IS THE ACUTE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION ON IT'S A REPORTS ON THE HOMES? AB. WELL I I I THINK IT. I'M GOING TO PUT THAT QUESTION WHAT SHORTCOMINGS TO THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION BREAKPOINT TO RATHER THAN. THE COMMISSION SHORTCOMINGS THAT AFFECTS AYE YEAH YEAH. YEAH THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BUT. AND WHAT WE WANNA DAY IDENTIFY THAT TODAY YEAH I. THINK YEAH. WHAT ARE FIRST OF ALL I THINK THEY? THEY ENCOURAGED US TO OF. TO LOOK AT. SERIOUSLY LOOK AT PARTNERSHIPS IN THE ARM PRIVATE WORLD IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD TO HELP US SO WE DON'T HAVE EXPERTISE IN THAT. THING THAT THEY REALIZE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE HOMELESS WAS. ANTIQUATED AND. THE LIVERY OF MEDICAL CARE WAS NOT EFFICIENT THERE IN ALMOST HELPED POINT THE DIRECTION TOWARD A NEW FACILITY FOR ME. ARM. AND. SUPPORTING THE THE CONCEPT OF. PERIODICALLY STUDYING EVERY HOME WHICH IS WHAT THIS LEGISLATION ON THE HOME SPECIFIC MASTER PLAN IS GOING TO DO. AND I THINK ALSO. NOT THE. IT'S SHORT ALL OF THEIR FINDINGS WERE THINGS THAT WE EITHER SUSPECTED OR HAD ALREADY STARTED DUBBED WORKING ON AND WERE ALMOST RELIEF TO BUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE GOING TO CHANGE. ARM IN FIVE YEARS. EVERY WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN WILL BE A HUNDRED YEARS OR OLDER. IN TEN YEARS EVERY KOREAN WHERE THAT WILL BE NINETY YEARS OLD OR OLDER. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THE NUMBER OF VETERANS THAT ARE THEN GOING TO START COMING JUST TEN YEARS FROM NOW. BY THIS MAN MASSIVE AMOUNT OF VIETNAM VETERANS BUT I THINK AT THE SAME TIME MEDICAL SCIENCE. WHICH I FOLLOW IT MAY BE MORE CLOSELY THAN ANYONE ELSE. WITH RESPECT TO THE KINDS OF INJURIES THAT THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE SO STAYING IN THE IRAQ WAR I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WAIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY COMING AT US. BECAUSE THE YOUNG FOLKS ARE SUSTAINING BRAIN INJURIES. DRAMATIC. ENCEPHALITIS THAT THESE AND UP BUT FORGET THE MENTAL HEALTH AT THE. POSTER MATIC STRESS JUST THE ORGANIC INJURIES ARE GOING TO PRESENT WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND TO OUTRIGHT DEMENTIA IN NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE NOT ANTICIPATED. SO IT IT ASKING US TO LOOK AT WHAT'S COMING. WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT A WAY FOR THAT IS. IT'S VERY SCARY TO BEHOLD. I DON'T KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR ANY STATE IS GOING TO PREPARED BE PREPARD TO DO. THE BEST JOB IT WISHED IT COULD DO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE WHAT IS THE BEST WE CAN DO IT ALL. TO. HIM BASED ON THAT WE HAD A MASTER PLAN I GUESS THAT YOU HAD PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND. ARE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND SO IT'S SIX YEARS OLD. TIMES OF CHANGED. SO WHAT OF THAT MASTER PLAN OR YOU CAN CONTINUE TO USE IF AT ALL. AND WHILE. MOST OF WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT. WHO DO YOU HAVE WORKING ON IT NOW? AND DO THEY HAVE THE SKILL SET TO TO CONTINUE. AND ADAPT TO THE LITTLE OVER PLANS THAT. ASSISTANT WITH A DEPUTY A GERARD HERE I THINK COMMISSION PEPTO MISTER PLANNING TO THOUSAND TWELVE SO WANTED TO TAKE WHATEVER START. SO THE ORIGINAL MASTER PLAN WAS CREATED FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT REASONS. IT WAS CREATED TO TAKE ALL OF A LONGER. TERM LOOK AT WHAT WE MIGHT DO WITH THE PROPERTY THERE'S A PROCESS CALLED THE CAPITAL OUTLAY. PLAN WITHIN THE STATE BUDGET CYCLE AND. WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE TIME WORK JUST BANDAID APPROACHES TO SIMPLE INFRASTRUCTURE DID MAINTENANCE A? RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE HOME WE NEEDED A BROADER. VIEW OF THINGS AND SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE WENT OUT AND HIRED A. ARCHITECTURAL FIRM THAT HAD LONG TERM CARE. EXPERTISE AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE BUILDING STRUCTURE I WE HIRED FOLKS FROM. GENERAL SERVICES IN THE REAL ESTATE WORLD TECH. TO HELP US COME UP WITH SOME CONCEPTUAL IDEAS SO THAT. WE HAD SOMETHING TO. TO REFER BACK TO WHEN IT CAME TO OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS. SNIFFED BUILDING. COINCIDENTALLY. WAS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY BASED ON THE CONDITIONS OF HOLDER MEANT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN. AND SO IT'S NOT. UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT TODAY WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WE'VE BEEN. PUTTING MONEY INTO IT. HAND OVER FIST AND WHILE WE'RE STAYING UP WATER THE THE YOU KNOW THAT THE STANDARD OF. CARE FOR. A ROOM IS NOT ADEQUATE. SO THERE WERE A VARIETY OF OF REASONS OF WHY WE DID THAT. THERE SOME CONCEPTUAL IDEAS ABOUT USING PUBLIC. ENTITIES TO HELP US WITH THE DEVELOPMENT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE STATE BUDGET PROCESSES IS IS CUMBERSOME INCIDENTS. THERE'S EVALUATION OF LEASES AND SO FORTH WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THAT TIME IS. IMPLEMENTED. AS MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE AUTHORITY THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE'S AUTHORITY ALLOWS SO WE'VE TALKED WE'VE MADE FOR. EFFORTS IN EIGHTY A WE'VE. ADDRESSED. FAIR MARKET VALUE WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. WE'VE TO TAKE A LOOK AT ADJACENCY. BUILDING. WE'VE. DEVELOPED. THAT REACHED OUT. TO THE TOWN TO SEE HOW WE CAN. RESOLVER REDUCE COSTS IN JUST A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS UP WE CONTINUE TO USE. THE THE EXISTING MASTER PLAN FOR YOUNTVILLE. AND AND PULL FROM IT WHAT IS RELEVANT. WHAT IS A ACCOMPLISH? MOBILE. AND WE CONTINUE TO TO MOVE FORWARD. THE. RESEARCH ARE THEY THE MASTER PLANNING FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THAT THAT. DOCUMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION AND AND UTILIZED. FOR THE OVERALL SYSTEM. SO. THAT. THAT'S ALL I RESPOND TO THAT. THANK YOU SO WE HAVE ONE HAVING MORE QUESTIONS SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PER DIEM IN YOU MEDI CAL MEDICARE AND. AND. AND CAL THAT. WHERE THE PERSON IS IT PERCENTAGES OF EACH? SO WE KNOW WHAT. WITH SILO WHO I WAS SO RIGHT NOW OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF OF REVENUES VIS A PER DIEM. EIGHT ATTENDANCE IS ABOUT THREE PERCENT ARMY PRETTY ABOUT SIXTY THREE PERCENT. EIGHT ATTENDANCE IS THREE PERCENT ORG OR CURRENTLY ESTIMATING A MEDI CAL AROUND NINE PERCENT. MEDICARE AGAIN AB IS AROUND SIX PERCENT. AND IN FEES DE INSURANCE OTHER THINGS ARE ARE AROUND THE. THE. ONE PERCENT SO. I I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITY AGAIN YOU HAVE TO BE QUALIFIED FOR MEDIC MEDIC CAO. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING THOSE WERE BEING VERY ACTIVE IN THOSE IN THOSE SEARCHES. AND WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT WERE JUST AGAIN BEEN A LITTLE BUSY WITH FOCUSING ON THE FIVE OTHER HOMES BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE THINK WE CAN TOUCH THAT WE THINK WE CAN. WE CAN EXPLORE GET A GREAT DEAL OF OF OF OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR FOR MEDI CAL RESIDENTS THAT ARE QUALIFIED. WHAT'S THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO. WE WOULD GO BELOW THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD SO. THAT WE DO WE DO KNOW SOME STATES DO THAT IN THE FORMER MEDICAID IN THAT'S ALL THEY'RE ABLE TO GET AS CLOSE TO REVENUE NEUTRAL AS POSSIBLE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE LOOK DOWN THAT PATH. ISSUES ELIGIBLE. JUST ON I KNOW I MEAN WE TALK ABOUT BARSTOW BEFORE AND IF AT ALL HARD TIME WITH THE OCCUPANCY THERE AND AND PEOPLE EVEN WANT TO WORK THERE. WHEN YOU SAY WHEN. AND ACTUALLY YOU KNOW CUT FISH OR CUT BAIT. I. THAT MAY BE THE IMPLICIT ARM. OUR THAT'S IMPLIED IN. DEVELOPING MASTER PLANS FOR EACH OF THE HOMES. SO WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE AN ANSWER ON OUR ALL OF OUR HOMES THE RIGHT SIZE DELIVERING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF CARE AND IN THE RIGHT PLACE. IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS IF NOT BEFORE. I DID JUST THAT I'M NOT SURE IF OF THE ONE OTHER QUESTION WAS ANSWERED ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT OR WHO WHO IS IT THAT YOU HAVE WORKING ON THAT MASTER PLAN THE RESOURCES HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. IT IS DONE ON TIME AND IS. HIGH QUALITY OF THIS IS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT DOCUMENT FOR THE HOMES AND SO I WASN'T SURE IF I HEARD. I HEARD. THAT. RIGHT A DUCK IN THE I'M SORRY MA'AM ARE YOU TALKING THE MASTER PLAN FOR YOU NOW. THE OVERALL MASTER PLAN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S. IT HAS. THAT ANSWERS ALL OUR QUESTIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND DO THOSE HIGH QUALITY HAVE WHO DO WE HAD DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES BEING SPENT ON MAKING SURE. THAT. WE END UP. WITH A GOOD PRODUCT. ON JULY TWENTY NINETEEN AND DELIGHT NINETEEN YES MA'AM AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED IS IN IS IN HIS OPENING REMARKS WE WE'VE HIRED A. AN AMAZING. TALENTED INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS. THAT IS IMPRESSED US. IT WITH HER. APPRECIATION OF THE OF THE ASK. WITH THE PRODUCT LOOKS LIKE. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE AUTHORIZED TO TO INDIVIDUALS TO DO THIS AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF OF THE HIGHER IN THE SECOND PERSON. NOW WE FEEL COMFORTABLE AT THIS STAGE WE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE. OVERSIGHT ON A REGULAR BASIS. ALONG THE WAY IF WE FEEL LIKE THAT THAT THAT. THERE'S A ISSUE WITH THIS WILL LET LET EVERYBODY KNOW BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW IF YOU REALLY ENCOURAGE WITH WHO WE GOT SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS THIS THE SORT OF A RESEARCH. AND THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE WHAT WE'VE MASTERED TWO AWE ON TIME AND WANTED TO SAY THE SECOND PERSON IS COMING ON BOARD HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED THAT WE HAVE HIRED WE HAD WERE IN THE HIRING PROCESS NOW. REVIEWING. INDIVIDUALS. IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN AGP EIGHT POSITION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL ROCA. I AM. RECENTLY BECAME THE VICE CHAIR ASSISTING OUR CHAIR. AND I JUST WANTED TO LET. YOU KNOW MISTER SECRETARY YOUR ASSISTANT SECRETARIES. THAT DUMB. I BEEN WORKING ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THIS IS ONLY THE TIP OF YOUR ICEBERG. AND. I. MAKE A VOWED TO YOU AND TO OUR CHAIR. THAT I WILL WORK DILIGENTLY AND VERY HARD. AND I WILL BE YOUR WORKER BEE TO THE GREATEST OF MY. ABILITY. I FIND IT IRONIC. YEAH FULLY VETTED COULD SAY IT THIS WAY I FIND IT IRONIC THAT I'M THE. LAST CURRENTLY SERVING VIETNAM VETERAN IN THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE. AND SO DO MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS. I'LL BE WORKING. I'LL BE WORKING FOR YOU. WITH THAT SAID THOUGH. WE HAVE MAJOR SYSTEMIC AND BUSINESS MODEL. CHANGES AND. TWEAKS THAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE HAVE NO CHOICE. AND WHAT I. BASE THAT UPON IS NOT JUST A SEVENTY PERCENT AND THE HARD MONEY. THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE BUT WE ALSO. WILL BE WORKING TO NOT COMPROMISING THE CARE. IN THE LOVE. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT ME YOU CAN'T PUT LOVE INTO A SPREADSHEET. OKAY BECAUSE FROM PEOPLE. SO WE WANNA KEEP THAT PART OF THAT AS WELL. THE DIFFERENT CHANGES. MANY WILL BE GOOD. AND. HERE'S MY MASTER PLAN IN MY HEAD JUST SO YOU GENTLEMEN KNOW. RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT THESE. TORRANCE AND WAVES OF VETERANS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDING HELP. WE ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT THE WAR ON TERROR. IS NEVER ENDING. WE WILL HAVE NEW WARS. WE MAY HAVE A NEW GENERATION OF KOREAN WAR VETERANS WE DON'T KNOW IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS WORLD RIGHT NOW. SO. I'M FIGURING. THAT. WE MAKE OUR BEST MASTER PLAN. AND THEN YOU FIGURED THAT AS SOON AS WE EXECUTED AND REALLY GET GO ON GONNA CHANGE COMPLETELY. AND THAT'S IS GONNA BE THE NATURE OF THE BEAST THAT WE FACE. SO GOD BLESS YOU A GOOD IDEA. WORK IT. A. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR OF I I JUST HAVE THE AYE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL WITHOUT A LOT OF AND QUESTIONS HERE BUT I I'D DO JUST WANTED I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY AT. GOT PHIL AT THE ON THAT PROPERTY AND SO HOPEFULLY. YOU DO OUT SOMEBODY VERY CREATIVE THAT'S GOING TO GET SOME GOOD SOLUTIONS THERE. BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO I THINK IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER COPIER THAT BROUGHT UP THE. UNFAVORABLE LEASES WAS THAT YOU THAT BROUGHT THOSE UP. AND I JUST LIKE HOW DID THOSE GET APPROVED AND. GOING FORWARD. DOES THERE NEED TO BE OF MORE OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. REALLY YOU WERE THERE. BUT. WE WERE THERE THANK YOU SIR. SO THE SO THE LEASES THAT ARE THAT THAT ARE IN PLAY THAT ARE. HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY GENERAL SERVICES ARE. REPRESENTATION OF WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE. BEST VALUE AT THE TIME. THAN THE CIRCUMSTANCE. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN AWARE OF THE FACT THAT. FAIR MARKET VALUE IS WHAT THE. THE LAW WOULD REQUIRE. A WE ALWAYS START OUT FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT FAIR MARKET VALUE IS FOR THE SPACE WE ALSO INCLUDES. UTILITIES AND SO FORTH. GENERALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS IS THAT. ARE ALONG THE PROCESS. WE SOMETIMES FROM. ARE GREETED WITH EXTERNAL INFLUENCE THAT ALLOWS US OR. OBLIGATES US TO. ADJUST ACCORDINGLY. WE DON'T NECESSARILY SET THESE THE RATES ARE OURSELVES WE DO A COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND PERHAPS. THE. THE OCCUPANT. AND SO. THAT THAT SPEAKS AGAINST TO THE CURRENT STATUS THEY THEY THE LEASES ARE APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED. WE TRY TO IMPLEMENT FIVE YEAR. DURATION TERMS SO THAT WHEN THE. POLICE HAS EXPIRED OR APPROACHING WE CAN REVISIT THE. FAIR MARKET VALUE AND GO THROUGH THAT SAME PROCESS AGAIN THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE VERY VERY OLD. THAT BEEN ESTABLISHED THEY WERE NOT ESTABLISHED PERHAPS BY OUR INITIATION BUT PERHAPS BY AN EXTERNAL ENTITY OR A. LEGISLATIVE LEADER AND WHAT HAVE YOU AWARE THOSE LEASES ARE FAIRLY ROCK SOLID. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T BE REVISITED BUT THE. I GUESS LIKE I REFER BACK TO THE TERM. AND THE VALUE AT THE TIME. REPRESENTS THE CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE HAVE A COUPLE THAT ARE COMING UP. THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT WE ARE IN PROCESS WITH AND WE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE SAME. ROUTE WHERE WE WILL PURSUE FAIR MARKET VALUE AND WE'LL SEE WHERE THOSE NEGOTIATIONS INCOME. COME TO A CONCLUSION AS TO WHAT'S FAIR INVEST FOR FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED. SOMETIMES. HAVING. THE OCCUPANTS WITHIN OUR BUILDINGS. VACANT BUILDINGS JUST KEEP THEM OPERATIONAL ON THAT ACTUALLY IS A PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TYPE OF THING AS WELL SO SOMETIMES WE LOOK AT IT THAT WAY ITSELF AS WELL. SO YOU WOULD SAY THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THESE WERE FAIR AT THE TIME THAT THEY WERE. PUT INTO PLACE OR THAT THERE DOESN'T REALLY NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT. THEY HAD. DONE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THEY REPRESENT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DAY SOMETIMES THE THE THE THE BUDGET ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS AND OBLIGATE AND THERE'S MORE INFLUENCE THAT WE HAVE TO PERHAPS CECA A HIGHER LEVEL OF REVENUE SOMETIMES THE EXTERNAL PRESSURE SHIPS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. TO WHERE PERHAPS. THOUGH LEASE SEE. OCCUPIES THAT SPACE BECAUSE IT'S MORE IN LINE WITH OUR OUR MISSION AND VISION SO IT SORT OF DEPENDS WHETHER THEY. WERE WELL AWARE. OF OF WHAT THOSE. WITH THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT. I THINK GENERAL SERVICES PROVIDES RE OF. VERY GOOD OVERSIGHT AS TO WHAT THE EXPECTATION OF LEASES ARE AND HOLD US ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE. OKAY. RIGHT WELL. GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A VERY INFORMATIVE AND. MAKE SURE TO LET US KNOW HOW YOU ARE. PROGRESSING ON THE. ON THE MASTER PLAN AND AGAIN. VICE JUST THE BIG DIFFERENCE WITH YOUR CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP AND AND. WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE COMPLIMENTS THINKING FAVOR MUCH. ALL RIGHT AND.

BOB AND WHAT CAN BE DONE AND THAT THAT YOU SEE AND HOW THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN RESPONDING TO VARIOUS. BUT CHALLENGES. BOB YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE STATE OPERATE VETERANS HOME. THAT WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST SYSTEMS IN THE COUNTRY. THAT THE BULB BUDGET IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIX MILLION DOLLARS. SIXTY PERCENT OF THAT A HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE COMES FROM THE GENERAL FUND. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ABOUT PRICE A PER BED PER YEAR BUT IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN THAT IT'S ACTUALLY HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND. ONCE YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE REIMBURSEMENTS IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT COME FROM OTHER SOURCES. SO IT'S A ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR A COST PER BED AND THE LEGISLATURE UP THE IS RIGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT COST AND TO. HOW THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MAYBE THERE ARE BETTER AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO ABOUT CARING FOR VETERANS IN OUR STATE? BOB. YOU'VE GOT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THEM ARE FIFTY FIVE OR OLDER UP BUT THE BEDS AVAILABLE ARE THERE FOR A LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF THOSE VETERAN SO THERE IS A. FUTURE POPULATION. THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM. EVERY VISIT OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO VETERANS. UP WE KNOW THAT THERE'S. A GROWING. ARM BUT USE OF COMMUNITY BASED FACILITIES. AND COMMUNITY BASED OPERATIONS. AND VETERANS ARE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE. THAT TO STAY HOME. TO GET THE CARE THAT YOU NEED YOU'D LIKE TO BE AT HOME. YOU WANT TO BE CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR GRANDKIDS YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO WALK TO THE PARK AND GO TO THE MOVIE THEATER AND ENJOY THE RESTAURANTS. THAT HAVE FORMED OF OF OF A PART OF YOUR LIFE. AND SO. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION A AS WELL. NO OTHER STATE THAT WE REVIEWED ON THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. FUNDS THEIR STATES AWAY THE CALIFORNIA DOES. THAT WE ARE UNIQUE IN THAT WAY AND SO YOU REALLY NEED TO ASK YOURSELF WHETHER THAT IS THAT AS A SPECIAL NICHE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE TO OCCUPY. A AND I THINK THAT WHAT. THE SECRETARY IS DOING. IS ENSURING THAT THERE WILL BE A VIGOROUS EXAMINATION OF THE DIFFERENT MODELS. THAT ARE AT WORK ON IN THE COUNTRY. BOB WE HAD A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS YOU'VE HEARD MANY OF THEM. AND THAT WE'VE GOT A LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS. AND I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT SHOULD YOU CHOOSE IT. TO DECIDE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO USE YOUR TIME. BUT QUITE FRANKLY YOU'VE GOT TWO OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL WHO ARE FAR BETTER THAN I. AT TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE TOPIC THAT YOU HAVE AGAIN LET ME EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. OF FOR YOUR COMMITMENT DEBT TO VETERANS. THAT AND PLEASE KNOW THAT LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION. STANDS READY BUT TO CONTINUE TO. ASSIST YOU. BOB IN ADVANCE IN THE AGENDA FOR SERVICES FOR VETERANS. JACK NUMBER AS A WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M HERE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A REPORTER OFFICE PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IN RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE. IN THE REPORT WE DISCUSSED VARIOUS SERVICES OFFERED TO VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA BUT MAINLY WITH THE FOCUS ON THE VETERAN HOMES OPERATED BY CAL THAT SO MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW THE VETERAN HOMES ARE FUNDED. DISCUSSING CURRENT CAPACITY IN DEMAND. PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE BETTER HOMES SYSTEM THAT OCCURRED AS A PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROCESS AND ALSO OFFERING A SUMMARY. OF RELEVANT BUDGET PROPOSALS UP FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. BUDGET DELIBERATION PROCESS. FIRST WITH REGARDS TO HOW VETERANS HOMES ARE FUNDED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES. A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND COST TO SERVE ABOUT. ROUGHLY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED VETERANS ACROSS THE HOMES IT IS EXPECTED THAT THESE GENERAL FUND COSTS WILL BE OFFSET BY HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS. AND WE KNOW THAT THESE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS COME INTO THE STATE I'M MONTHS ARE POTENTIALLY YEARS AFTER KOSTER ACTUALLY ANCHORED. I ONCE BECOME FOR THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS THE NET GENERAL FUND COST IS VENN ESTIMATED TO BE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN A TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AS AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE WE DO NOT BUT THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS BUT THE STATE RECEIVES DOES VERY BY THE LEVEL OF CARE VETERANS ARE RECEIVING IN THE HOMES. AND ALSO A VETERANS DISABILITY STATUS. NEXT WITH REGARDS TO CAPACITY I'M BASED OFF OF THE MOST RECENT DATA WE WERE ABLE TAX. VERIFY THAT THE FIGURE IN OUR REPORT THAT WAS HANDED OUT ON PAGE FIFTEEN FIGURE TEN THAT SHOWS THE I'M CAPACITY IN COMPARISON TO THE WAIT LIST IS STILL I'M ACCURATE. MEANING THAT BASED ON RECENT DATA WE SEE THAT DEMAND HASN'T CHANGED MUCH SINCE WE PUBLISHED OUR REPORT AND WE SEE THAT ACROSS ALL HOMES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF CARE SUCH AS DOMUS SILLERY OR INDEPENDENT LIVING FACILITIES FOR THE MOST PART. DEMAND OR PEOPLE ON THE WAIT LIST THERE'S. IT IT SEEMS TO LINE WITH CURRENT CAPACITY WITHIN THE HOMES HOWEVER THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF UNMET DEMAND FOR SKILLED NURSING AND MEMORY CARE BATS. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT ON A PER HOME BASE AS CAPACITY IN DEMAND DOES VERY WITH SOME HOMES. I'M NOT BEING ABLE TO CUT ACCOMMODATE THAT THE CURRENT DEMAND THAT THEY HAVE FOR DOMICILIARY PADS AND ALSO OTHER HOMES HAVING BEING GET PADS ACROSS VARIOUS LEVELS OF CARE. IN ADDITION IN THE REPORT WE DISCUSSED THAT. IN THIS LARGER CONVERSATION OF CAPACITY WHILE BASIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THE HOMES CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE IN RESIDENTS WITH COMPLEX AND MENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. MOVING ON FROM CAPACITY IN THE REPORT WE ALSO REACHED RAISED A NUMBER OF ISSUES. FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THAT DELIVER AT THE SERVICE DELIVERY WITHIN THE HOMES AND AS A PART OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET PROCESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES WERE WERE ADDRESSED THROUGH LEGISLATION. PRIMARILY ONE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LONG TERM FASTER PLAN FOR THE VETERANS HOMES. IN WHICH CALVET WILL ASSESS THE FUTURE LONG TERM CARE NEEDS OF VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA AND POTENTIAL DEMAND. I'M FOR VETERANS HOMES IN HOPES THAT BASED OFF OF THESE FINDINGS OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WE WOULD BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO ADOPT THE VETERAN HOMES SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD TO MEET FUTURE DEMAND. IN ADDITION ANOTHER CHANGE THAT CAME THROUGH BUDGET RELATED LEGISLATION WAS A PRIORITIZATION OF VETERANS WITH HIGHER DISABILITY LEVELS FOR ADMISSIONS. THESE VETERANS TYPICALLY RECEIVE HIGHER FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR THE COST OF CARE WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN FUTURE YEARS. AS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN CALVET WAS TASKED TO ASSESS POTENTIAL TRADEOFFS IN PRIORITIZING VETERANS WITH HIGHER. DISABILITY I'M RATINGS THAN THOSE VETERANS. AND THEN OTHER VETERANS AND THE POTENTIAL COSTS AND SAVINGS THAT THIS DECISION MAY HAVE. OTHER POINTS THAT WERE I HAVE RAISED IN THAT BUDGET RELATED LEGISLATION ALSO INCLUDED. IF WITHIN THE MASTER PLAN CALVET DISCUSSING HOW THE HOMES COULD BETTER SERVE VETERANS WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. AND ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE STREAMLINED ONLINE APPLICATION SYSTEM FOR VETERANS. I AM TECH AND MY BRIEF REMARKS I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON TO BUDGET RELATED PROPOSALS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE HAVING WITH REGARD TO THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM. OUR OFFICE IS STILL IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THESE PROPOSALS BUT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL BOTH RELATE TO THE. VETERANS HOME IN YOUNTVILLE. ONE IS A PROPOSAL TO BEGIN PRELIMINARY PLANS THAT WOULD CONSTRUCT A SKILLED NURSING AND MEMORY CARE FACILITY LARGELY TO REPLACE THE CURRENT SKILLED NURSING AND MEMORY CARE FACILITIES WITH ANYA BELL. THE OTHER UP BOZELL IS TO REDUCE OUR IT IS TO CONVERT THE AND. IS TO CONVERT CURRENT DOUBLE. DOMICILIARY ROOMS INTO SINGLE DOMICILIO ROOMS WITHIN THE YOUNG FILLED FACILITY AGAIN WERE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING INFORMATION BUT AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL SOME OF THE. WHAT ONE OF THE MAIN KEY QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE IS HOW DOES THIS ADDED THESE PROPOSALS FIT WITHIN THE LARGER CONTEXT OF THE MASTER PLAN? AND AND THE ATTEMPTS OF NOT ONLY. IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE WITHIN ONE HOUSE OF WITHIN ONE HOME BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF. DEVELPING A PLANET FOR CHANGES ACROSS ALL THE HOMES. AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. WHY DON'T WE WAIT TILL THE? AND. FOR ALL HER QUESTIONS IF YOU DON'T MIND. LET'S GO TO OUR LAST SPEAKER COMMEND CHAIRMAN BURTON CHESNY. WEARING A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT HATS AND THE VICE CHAIR VETERANS RESOURCE CENTERS OF AMERICA. FORTY FIVE YEAR OLD NONPROFIT BASED IN SANTA ROSA CALIFORNIA. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ITS SUBSIDIARY. VETERANS HOUSING DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND WHERE THE PROCESSDEVELOPING A NUMBER OF PERMITS SUPPORTIVE IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FACILITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OUR BOARD MEMBER OF. A CHASM OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES OF SIMILAR AGENCIES AROUND. CALIFORNIA FORMER BED BOARD MEMBER THE NCH BI NATIONAL COALITION FOR HOMELESS VETS. AND A FORMER CONSULTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. ARM AND I'M HAPPY TO SEE THAT YOU'VE UPGRADED POSITION THE STANDARD THAT YOU APPLY FROM WHEN I HELD SO. BUT I'VE BEEN WORKING IN. OF THE HOMELESS VETERAN ISSUE FOR ABOUT FOR DECADES. AND SO THAT'S SORT OF THE FOCUS I BRING TO IT IS HARDLY HELP THAT POPULATION. WHICH IS THE MOST AT RISK AND THEY HIGHEST HARDEST TO SERVE. BEFORE GOING TO THAT THOUGH I WANT TO. DEVELOPMENT AND THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING ARE I'M A VIETNAM VET LIKE THE VICE CHAIR. ARE AND% IT IS SO WONDERFUL TO SEE THE DRAMATIC. CHANGE AND THE POLITICS AROUND VETERANS FROM OUR ERA TO THIS I WAS JUST PHENOMENAL AND THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF THAT THAT CHANGE LET'S. JUST FROM I JUST CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH BECAUSE IT WAS SO DIFFERENT THAT. BUT HER BACK TO HOMELESS VETS ON. A. WE ARE SEEN AS THE SECRETARIES TO QUITE A LITTLE BIT AN INCREASING. ACUITY OF THE ISSUES FACING THAT POPULATION. THEY ARE AGING. THEY ARE HAVING. MORE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. SOME OF THAT IS THE DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURIES THAT THE SECRETARY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THAT IS THE. OPIATE ADDICTIONS THAT WERE. AND PART OF THE CAME OUT OF THE SERVICE AND CAME OUT OF THE A CARE WITH THOSE OPIATE ADDICTIONS. ARM PART OF IT IS THE FACT THAT I COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL DRAFTEE IN VIETNAM THE AMOUNT OF COMBAT THEY SEE IS FAR GREATER. AND YOU HAVE A. GREATER DIVERSITY IN THE POPULATION OF THOSE VETS THAT IN VIETNAM PARTICULARLY WITH WOMEN. WHO BRING ALL OF THE SAME? COMBAT EXPOSURE ISSUES THAT THE MEN BRING ON THE OPIATE ADDICTION ISSUES AND THEN THE SEXUAL TRAUMA AND THE DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT ISSUES. OF THAT THE WOMEN IN THE SERVICE. HA HA EXPERIENCE AND ADD INTO THAT EXPERIENCE THAT THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS IT SO ARE. AND. A DIFFERENT POPULATION TO SERVE IN THE. A. OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS WE RUN. A SEVERAL TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FACILITIES AND PERMITS MORE HOUSING FOR THOSE ARE TRADITIONAL FACILITY TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES THAT WERE USED. TO BRING FOLKS IN OFF THE STREET ALL OUR FOLKS ARE FORMER OR WERE HOMELESS TOOK TO COME IN. NOT ORIGINALLY WERE IN BARRACKS LIKE ENVIRONMENTS AND THEN AND OF MULTIPLE BED UNITS BEDROOMS. HARD TO SERVE UP THAT WOMEN'S POPULATION AND SO BENNETT AND TAKES TIME TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. SERB THAT POPULATION WERE DOING THAT. BUT FRANKLY WE'RE. WERE BEHIND THE CURVE THE CURVE IN DOING IT. THE. IN. IRONICALLY IN ONE OF OUR FACILITIES IN YOUR REFILL WE BUILT A A A. NEW FACILITY TRANSITIONAL FACILITY DEDICATED SPACE FOR WOMEN. THAT WERE IMMEDIATELY OCCUPIED BY TRANSSEXUAL MEN. AND SO THERE WAS NO PLACE. FOR THE WOMEN. SO IT'S IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT CHANGING POPULATION AND WE'RE ALL HAVING TO COPE WITH IT TAKES RESOURCES. AND I WOULD URGE. THAT AS YOU LOOK FORWARD. THAT. THIS LIMITED RESOURCE THAT WE HAVE AT THE STATE TO SERVE THIS POPULATION. OUT WE REALLY FOCUS ON THAT HARDEST TO SERVE THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED ARM. OF THE HOMELESS AND AT RISK GRATTERI. A. THAT. WE HAD BEGUN A. S. OF REDUCING THAT NUMBER SIGNIFICANTLY RECENT ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE AND WE HAVE WORKERS TO SEE WHAT THE MOST RECENT POINT CURRENT TIME COUNTS ARE GOING TO PRODUCE. ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LA WENT UP FIFTY PERCENT YEAR OVER YEAR OF HOMELESS VETERANS. WE'VE MOSTLY WORK IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE SEEING. A NOT QUITE AS HIGH BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS AS WELL. AND SO. THIS KIND OF A. GROUPINGS OF FOLKS FOR THAT FOR THE HOMES. YOU HAVE THE EIGHTEEN RARE ARM. AND AND THE VET WHO. IS COMING OUT OF OUR TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MIGHT BE YOUNGER BUT IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK. WERE THROUGH PROP FORTY ONE WERE ABLE TO NOW ABLE TO START BUILDING WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING. ITEM AND INVENTORY OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THAT POPULATION OF THAT. WORK CLEARLY LOOKING AT THIS MASTER PLAN OF HOW WE BETTER UTILIZE THE HOMES TO SERVE THAT. SIMILAR AGING. AND. A HUB VETERAN WHO'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO RETURN SUCCESSFULLY TO REALLY. GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT. AND I THINK IT'S IT'S IT'S A VERY PUEDEN AS THE VICE CHAIR POINTED OUT. UNLESS YOU CAN COME UP. WITH A VIABLE PLAN TO IN WORLD CONFLICT. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO NEED THAT RE THOSE RESOURCES OF THE VET HOMES TO SERVE THIS POPULATION. ARM AND A CON. THE ACUITY OF THEIR NEED WILL INCREASE THEIR POPULATIONS WILL INCREASE AND SO. I WOULD HATE TO SEE THIS AUCTION AWAY. THAT RESOURCE SERVE NINE VETERAN NEEDS. BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE RABBIT REVENUE GENERATING IN SOME FASHION THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKED AT LEVERAGING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ARE EVER NOT MY I THINK THAT. A RECOMMENDATION I WOULD MAKE WITH RESPECT TO YOU HAN FELL OF. A BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BEST SUITED FOR. USES OTHER POPULATION YOUNGER POPULATION OF VETS. WHO? TYPICALLY FEW YEARS AFTER THEY COME OUT. THERE THEIR BRIDGES HAVE BEEN BURNED THERE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES AND THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES OF GOT TO THE POINT. WHERE THEY'RE EITHER EITHER? THEIR FAMILIES HAVE BROKEN UP THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS THERE AT IMMINENT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS IF NOT HOMELESS ALREADY. BET HAVE NOT. GONE SO FAR DOWN THAT PATH. THAT. BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO. WITH GOOD TREATMENT AND TRAINING. PETE RETURNED TO CIVILIAN LIVES AND I THINK IF IN LOOKING AT THE ART FILL RESOURCE. ONE OF MY QUIBBLES WITH. A OF MY FRIEND. MR NOVICE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FACT THAT YOU SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD USE YOUR UP FILL FOR VETERANS EMPLOYMENT TRAINING. POINTING TO THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY IN NAPA VALLEY AS A SOURCE OF JOBS WITH THAT TRAINING. AND. I THINK. A YOUNG PHIL WOULD BE EXCELLENT FOR A POPULATION OF VETS FOR TRAINING. BUT NOT IN HOSPITALITY BECAUSE IN NAPA VALLEY BECAUSE THOSE FOLKS MAY GET JOBS BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE VALLEY. SO WHIPPED BEING TRAINED FOR HOSPITALITY DOESN'T YOU CHIU NECESSARILY LEVEL LIVABLE WAGE AND MUCH OF CALIFORNIA. BUT IF WE TARGETED THROUGH THE TAP PROGRAM AT THE DEPARTMENT. THROUGH THE NETWORK OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES IN CASPER AND ELSEWHERE. AND IDENTIFIED THAT. THAT SUBSET OF VETS WHO. WITH QUICK MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT TRAINING CAMERA TO RETURN TO PRODUCTIVELY LIVES. YOU KNOW OUR PROGRAMS ARE SIX OF. THE RC. A ARE TRANSITIONAL PROGRAM OF THAT HAVE GRADUATES. TYPICALLY AFTER TEN MONTHS TO A YEAR. NINETY PERCENT OF OUR GRADUATES ARE SUCCESSFUL AND PERMANENT HOUSING AFTER GRADUATE AFTER THEY COMPLETE OUR PROGRAM. SO WE TARGET A. ARE A GROUP OF VETS. WHO ARE YOUNGER? WHO ARE HEADED DOWN A PATH TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS MAYBE CHEST ON IT? ARM AND A PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY ON FEEL FOR A EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. WITH COULD MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. AND COUPLED WITH AN EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY OF THEIR RESOURCES TO DUTY THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH VH IT FOR THE VETERANS HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION PROGRAM. A THROUGH OF OTHER SOURCES. THAT YOU COULD HAVE A VETERANS. YA FEEL VETERANS ACADEMY. THAT COULD A REALLY CHANGE YOUNG VETERANS LIVES I HELP THEM ADDRESS THE REAL ISSUES RETURNED TO THEIR FAMILIES AND RECLAIM THEIR FUTURES. I'D SAY A. A. THAT PLACE BUT FACILITY HAS A IT HAS PROVIDED ACTUAL OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT AND A VARIETY OF RESOURCES. YOU HAVE THE POLITICAL SUPPORT UP AROUND VETERANS TO ATTRACT. THAT A PARTICULAR IF THE STATE IS HELPING BRING IT TOGETHER. AND TO ATTRACT THE CORPORATE COMMUNITY. AND THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY VIA A OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES. HAVING OF A LIFE OF SUGGEST THAT MIGHT BE. DESERVE SOME RESEARCHERS THAT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STUDIES. OF IRAN. CORPORATION BY THE LOS ANGELES BUSINESS COUNCIL. ON THE DRAMATIC SAVINGS THAT HOUSING THE HOMELESS PROVIDES. ON MOST OF THOSE INNER TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND SAVINGS OR. AND THE STATEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES. POLICE ISSUES. SO WHILE HOUSING HOMELESS VETS MAY COST THE STATE'S OF MONEY. WE'RE SAVING THE PUBLIC TREASURY BY OFF SOME OF THOSE ESTIMATES AS MUCH AS THREE TIMES THE COST. SO HOW CAN WEEK SOMEHOW RECOUP SOME OF THAT COST TO HELP PAY FOR THE VETS. OF BECAUSE THERE CERTAINLY SAVINGS TO BE HAD. FROM OUR A HOUSING THE HOMELESS OF PARTICULAR HOMELESS VETS TO PUT THEIR LIFE AND LIMB AT RISK FOR THE REST OF HIS. ARMANDO DOWN TO ABOUT ONE PERCENT WILLING TO DO THAT. SO IT SEEMS A. A SMALL PRICE TO PAY. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU AND. AYE I DO HAVE TO SAY OF THE UNITED STATES DOES. I REALLY OWE ARE VIETNAM VETS AS YOU MENTIONED A BIG APOLOGY AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT. ATTITUDE TOWARD VETERANS. IS SO MUCH MORE. POSITIVE NOW THAN WHEN OUR MEN AND WOMEN RETURN TO WAS REALLY APPALLING MOTHER TREAT IT. SO. I GUESS FIVE FIRSTS ON QUESTION FOUR. MISTER NAVA. YEAH DOES. DO YOU SEE THAT WITH ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THE REPORT THAT'S. CAL THAT IS IS MOVING. TOWARD. TOWARD THEM OR THE LEGISLATURE IS MOVING TOWARD THEM OR IS THERE SOMETHING STILL THAT YOU THINK REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR CALVET. NOT LIKE BUT I DO THINK AT THEIR HOUSE. BEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT. ADVANCEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO. THE UP A CONCERN FOR VETERANS SERVICES AS WELL AS THE RECOMMENDATIONS. YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE. AND WHEN THE. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT THE VETERANS AFFAIRS. BOB PUTTING TOGETHER THEIR. PLAN. AND IDENTIFYING WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE HOMES. THAT'S GONNA BE THE BEGINNING OF IDENTIFYING FOR PEOPLE. WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON HOW MUCH DOES IT COST AND HOW THEY CAN DO IT BETTER. I AND WE SUSPECT THAT THROUGH THAT YOU'RE GOING TO FIND IT THERE ARE ECONOMIES THAT CAN BE. IMPLEMENTED THAT WILL MAKE OTHER FUNDS AVAILABLE TO THE SORT OF THING THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY BEYOND JUST WITHIN THE HOMES. I AM I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST. THAT. AS WE TALK ABOUT A VETERANS AND JOB TRAINING AT ANY GIVEN ARGUMENT FROM ANYBODY THAT VETERANS OUGHT TO BE. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A JOB TRAINING MANY VETERANS COME OUT OF THE MILITARY WITH SPECIFIC JOB SKILLS BUT I WILL. I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT AN AREA WHERE I THINK THAT TIME WOULD BE. WELL SPENT AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH. WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES LIKE THEME EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT? ARE YOU SEEN WHEN THEY CALCULATE THE CAREERS OF TOMORROW. WHETHER JOBS THAT ET DE IS IDENTIFYING AS BEING JOBS FOR THE FUTURE. BECAUSE LOU HOOVER COMMISSION HAS STARTED TOTHE PEAK UNDER THE COVERS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. AND SOME OF WHAT WE ARE ASKING IS HOW DO WE APPLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HOW DO WE ANTICIPATE JOB TRAINING NEEDS IN THE FUTURE GIVEN WHAT'S LIKELY TO BE THE IMPACTS OF ARTIFICIAL. INTELLIGENCE AND WHAT YOU'LL FIND IS THAT STATE AGENCIES. THAT HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOING THAT KIND OF PLANNING ARE LOOKING INTO REVIEW MER AND ARE NOT LOOKING STRAIGHT AHEAD. AND IT WOULD BE A A A TRAVESTY. TO THINK ABOUT INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IDENTIFYING JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED IT WHEN THERE HASN'T BEEN THE WORK DONE NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY GET THROUGH THE TRAINING. THERE'S A JOB THERE FOR THEM. WE DON'T WANT TO TRAIN THEM FOR JOBS ARE GOING TO DISAPPEAR AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO GO. BUT AS IT RELATES TO THE. SO THAT'S NOT REALLY PART OF OUR REPORT BUT IT'S SOMETHING I THINK AS WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH OF VETERANS AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE. HOW DO WE PROVIDE FOR VETERANS IN THE FUTURE WITH EMPLOYMENT THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE ASKING? OURSELVES WE NEED BE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT DATA. IN EVERY KIND OF ENDEAVOR THAT WE ENGAGE AND WE FIND IN LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AT ONE OF THAT. ONE OF THE REGULAR SHORTCOMINGS BUT WITH RESPECT A PROGRAMS IS. A A FAILURE AT THE INITIATION OF THE PROGRAM WHETHER IT BE THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGISLATIVE. TO REQUIRE COMPILATION OF DATA IN A FORM THAT ANYBODY CAN LOOK AT SO THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GETTING THE JOB DONE THERE'S A PART OF ME LIBERA CYNICISM IT'S STILL ALIVE. THAT SAYS THE PERHAPS THEY DO THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T MEASURE YOU CAN'T. REPRIMAND IF YOU DON'T HAVE STANDARDS. IF THERE'S NOTHING THAT HEY FELL AWAY FROM WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSE TO DO YOU CANCEL YOUR DOING A BAD JOB GOES AGAINST A WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WHERE MY METRICS HA HA YOU CAN MAKE THEM YOU DIDN'T MAKE ME HAVE THEM SO I'M SAYING IS THAT YOU GO THROUGH THESE THINGS YOU OUGHT TO BE THINKING AS WELL ABOUT METRICS TO MEASURE PROGRAM ACTIVITY? BOB I I THINK THAT AGAIN I THINK THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE VETERANS AFFAIRS HAVE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB WITH RESPECT TO LOOKING AT THESE UP RECOMMENDATIONS AND. DECIDING HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM I'D I'D I DON'T HAVE ANY. ANY COMPLAINTS. OKAY AND THEN. AND I GUESS ANY OF THIS THREE OF YOU COULD ANSWER I'VE BEEN POLICE HERE THEY. YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION OF A REDUCING OR ELIMINATING DOMICILIARY AND. CARE. AND AND HOW DO WE DO THIS WITHOUT ABANDONING OUR DUTY TO OUR VETS. BUT WHAT WHAT. HOW DO WE MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION? YEAH I THINK ONE OF THE SCARIEST STUBHUB THINGS AND ANYBODY. CAN HEAR IS THAT WERE YOU KNOW GRANT TAKE WAY HOME. WITHOUT THAT WOULD MAKE ME NERVOUS BITE MY WIFE CALLED ME UP AND SAID GUESS WHAT THE HOUSE IS GONE. I I I WOULD BE VERY UPSET AND ANXIOUS ABOUT ALL THAT. NOW THAT I'VE DONE ANYTHING WRONG I'M JUST SAYING IT. BUT. SO PART OF PART OF WHAT WE'D A PART OF WHAT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO DO WITH A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AND THIS IS ALSO ABOUT EDUCATING THE PUBLIC IN THE VETERANS. IF YOU HAVE AS AS WE'VE SEEN ACOSTA BED OF HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BED. YOU SAY THAT TO ANYBODY UNDERGONE LIKE JUST GIVE ME A VOUCHER. ALRIGHT I CAN PROBABLY FIND ME PRETTY DECENT HOTEL ROOM ON A CALLS FOR. A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IF WHAT YOU DO IS SAY. WE CAN ENGAGE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT DO HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH VETERANS AND PROVIDE SERVICES WE CAN DO THAT EITHER IN THEIR HOME. OR WE CAN DO THAT IN A FACILITY THAT IS. NOT NECESSARILY YOUR HOME BUT THEN AGAIN NOT A PERMANENT. BAD FOR SOMEONE ALL THE TIME YOU CAN GENERATE SOME OF THAT MONEY FROM IT RE VISITING. THROUGH THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING HOMES. MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT AND AND WE HAVE TO. INSURE THAT VETERANS UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL HONOR OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE. AND ONE OF THE BETTER WAYS TO DO IT IS TO LOOK THROUGH THE SYSTEM FIND THE INEFFICIENCY SQUEEZE THOSE OUT. AND THEN TAKE THE MONEY THAT YOU RECOVER. FROM THAT TO PUT IT INTO SERVICES THAT ARE BETTER. APPLY TO VETERANS. MAYBE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE WOULD NOTICE WHILE IS THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE CONSIDERING THAT TO DO IT EACH WITH THEIR OWN TRADE OFF SO. ANY CONSIDERATION OF CHANGING SOME OF THE MIX IN THE. LEVELS OF CARE SERVICES PROVIDE IN THE VETERANS HOME WOULD HAVE TO REQUIRE SOME INVESTIGATION OF WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE. AND THEN IDENTIFYING ARE THERE WAYS TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL UNMET NEED GIVEN JUST THE PROJECTION OF FUTURE NEEDS AND RECOGNIZING THAT. AND ASSESSMENT TODAY OF FUTURE DEMAND. MIGHT NOT REFLECT AN ASSESSMENT THAT WE CAN DO FIVE YEARS FROM NOW JUST GIVEN THE THAT CHANGING ON DEMOGRAPHICS WITHIN THE POPULATION AS WELL. I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT IS WE HAVE THIS INVENTORY OF HOMES BEING DEVELOPED UNDER THE H. P.. THAT ARE PERMANENT. ALL VERGE ALL OF THEM TO DATE HAVE BEEN I'M ALMOST ALL OF THEM BEEN PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ARM. AND A. HAS THAT INVENTORY IT'S DEVELOPED. ARE IT CAN ABSORB SOME OF THAT DOM POPULATION. AND THAT DOWN POPULATION CAN THEN BE TRANSFERRED. A. LOT TWO OTHER PURPORT REPURPOSE FOR OTHER THANKS BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE THIS ARE THEIR INVENTORY OF HOUSING LOCATED NEAR WERE PUT FOLKS ARE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH V. H. H. PRE. ELECTED NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING THAT'S COMING ONLINE HOPEFULLY. AND SO THERE IS WE CALIFORNIA HAS MADE IT SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING IT'S GONNA BE AWHILE FOR IT. TO GET GET BUILT. A BUT IT CAN RELIEVE SOME OF THE NEED FOR THE DOM SPACE SO IT CAN BE REPURPOSED FOR OTHER THINGS. AND ANOTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS IN OUR REPORT REDUCED. MENTIONED THAT DEPENDING ON THE PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE SETS OUT IN PARTICULARLY WHICH VETERANS. WOULD YOU LIKE THE VETERANS HOME SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON IF THEY'RE POTENTIALLY HOMELESS VETERANS UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY. WOULD JUST PROPORTIONALLY HOMELESS VETERANS TO HAVE A LEVEL OF COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF CARE. THERE'S A GAP IN RESOURCES THEY'RE. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THEN WHAT IS THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE VETERAN HOME SYSTEM FOR SOME OF THESE MORE DIFFICULT POPULATIONS THAT JUST TRADITIONALLY HAVE TROUBLE. I'M ME. ADD A DO TROUBLE IN THEIR HEALTH BUT THEN ALSO THERE HOUSING STABILITY. ANOTHER KEY POINT IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN WASHINGTON. IS MAINTAINING THE AND HOPEFULLY EXPANDING THE VASH PROGRAM. WHICH PROVIDES BOTH THE RENTAL SUBSIDY AND THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SERVICES CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES THAT MAKE THESE YOUR PROP FORTY ONE FUND BE HHB FUNDED PROJECTS WORK. I CAN'T. HOW ONTO SCORES YOU DE AND ORDER PARTICULARLY IN HIGH COST AREAS? YOU CAN'T PENCIL OUT A PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WITHOUT A PROJECT BASED. VOUCHERS SYSTEM FOR THE SUBSIDY. AND YOU CAN'T MANAGE A POPULATION OF CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. OF VETERANS WITHOUT GOOD PROFESSIONAL CASE MANAGEMENT ONSITE. WHICH COMES WITH THAT THE NATIONAL MISTER VOEPEL YOU HAD SOMETHING JUST SO THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A HOUSING IN THE TORY HOW MANY UNITS ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT OF THE EIGHT HP IS GONNA PROBABLY PRODUCE CLOSE TO THREE THOUSAND UNITS TO. EN I HAVE NO PLACE LIKE HOME I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT PROJECTIONS THAT COULD PRODUCE AS WELL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL THE ARROW. WELL I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS PANEL AND IT THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR FOR YOUR EXPERTISE AYE I AM. I REALIZED AYE IN ARTFULLY ASK THAT THE QUESTION EARLIER OF THE SECRETARY BECAUSE REALLY WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET TO ON ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT WITCHES. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A MENU OF OF NEEDS IN SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE. AND THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES HOW DO YOU KIND OF JUSTIFY WHERE YOU SPEND THE MONEY. ON IT NOT DETRACTING FROM ANY PARTICULAR. INJURY HERE OR ON. OR AT NEED BUT THERE'S LIMITED RESOURCES AND. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE LOW THAT'S THE REASON I ASKED. ORDER OTHER STATES DOING ITS BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT SOMETIMES ON. LOOKING AT HOW IT'S DONE ELSEWHERE MAY BE UP ALESTRA ATTEMPT BUT. WHEN I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS. IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH SENIORS WHICH IS TO TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE. IN THEIR HOMES AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT PROVIDES THEM WITH THE SERVICE. FOR SERVICES THEY NEED AS OPPOSED TO BRINGING THEM OUT AND THEN RESUMING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE. THAT MAY NOT BE KICKED OUT POSSIBLE IN ALL INSTANCES BUT. ON IT IT UP THE MORE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. THE ALTERNATIVES. AND AND ONE OF THE AS ALTERNATES FOR EXAMPLE MAY BE FOR. AT VETERANS THAT ARE DISABLED HELPING THEM FIX THEIR HOME. BOB WITH DISABILITY ACCESS SO THAT THEY CAN MANEUVER AROUND THERE THEIR RESIDENTS GIVEN THEIR THEIR RIGHT THERE DISABILITY AND THAT. THAT DOESN'T FALL VERY CLEANLY IN WITHIN IT ANYTHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BUT. BUT HAVING THOSE AS RESOURCES ON THIS MENU CHART MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND I'M HOPING THAT TIME. THAT THAT THAT THAT THE. THE ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN DONE TE REPORT THAT'S BEEN PREPARED CAN TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE WE WANT TO TRY TO DO IS KEEP. KEEP PEOPLE ON GIVE PEOPLE SERVICES AT THE LOWEST COST BUT REALLY RESPECTING WHERE THEIR PLACES BUT THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF THE HOMELESS BECAUSE THAT. THAT TO ME IS IS ON. IT'S THAT IT'S THE MOST UNCONSCIONABLE. AB. PROBLEM WE HAVE WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE RETURN AND BECAUSE OF THEIR. THEIR. INJURIES ARE OUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES THEY END UP ON THE STREETS. IT'S PARTICULARLY HARD FOR US. AS A DEVELOPER IN COULD WE WOULD DO MOSTLY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN RURAL AREAS. WE HAVE IT LAKE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNTY HAS OFFERED US FOR FREE. FOURTEEN ACRES. BUILD A AND WANT US TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS VETS. OUR PROBLEM IN MAKING THAT PENCIL OUT WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ALLOCATED PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS. THEY FAIR MARKET RENTS. AND LIKE COUNTY OR SO LOW. YOU CAN'T MAKE THE FINANCING WORK. AND SO IT'S. IT'S TOUGH IN THOSE RURAL AREAS ARM AND OFTEN. THEY'RE. WE'RE WE'RE DOING TO FACILITY IN THE CITY OF SHASTA LAKE JUST NORTH OF READING. IT'S ONLY THIRTY UNITS AND WE TRIED TO FIND PARTNERSHIP WITH TAX CREDIT DEVELOPERS. AND NINE WOULD DEVELOP. PARTNER WITH US BECAUSE THERE WAS ENOUGH RETURN OUT OF A THIRTY UNIT PROJECT. JEFF WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO COBBLE TOGETHER. THE RESOURCES DO WITHOUT A TAX CREDIT FINANCING. TRANSITIONAL HOUSING YOU CAN'T GET TAX GRANT FUNDING FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING WE'VE GOTTA. COBBLE TOGETHER BIG THAT MUCH HARDER FOR THAT IMPORTANT COMPONENT. OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. HAN. BUT I YOU CAN'T USE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FUNDING FOR TRANSITIONAL YOU CAN'T USE MHP FORAGE SOURCES. GEN. DOT FIGHT ANYTHING ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR YOUR READ YOUR. YOUR IDEA ABOUT. IF THE IF THE HOME ISN'T ACCESSIBLE. THEN INSTEAD OF SPENDING HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PICK A PERSON UP AND MOVE THEM INTO A. A STATE. OPERATE AT HOME. THEN. WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S REEVALUATION AND RE PURPOSING IS A WORD THAT WE'VE BEEN USING HERE. ALL OF THE HOMES. AND TAKING THE REVENUES. THAT COULD BE SAVED THAN I THAT THAT MAKES ABSOLUTE PERFECT SENSE. TO HAVE TO EMPOWER SOMEONE TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOME IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND IT'S CHEAPER TO BRING SOMEONE IN TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO THEM HOME THAN TO HAVE THEM IN A STATE. RUN HOME NOW THERE THERE THERE WILL BE THOSE VETERANS THAT HAVE TO HAVE. THAT INTENSIVE CARE. THAT WILL HAVE TO BE UP IN FACILITIES OPERATED BY THE STATE. I BUT I DO THINK AND I'M AND I'M OPTIMISTIC AND I THINK IT'S WISE FOR THIS THIS COMMITTEE. TO CONTINUE TO ASK THE SECRETARY. FOR UPDATES SO THAT THOSE KINDS OF PERSPECTIVES ARE REFLECTED IN THE MATRIX OF THE DECISION MAKING THAT IF IT IS IT IS ONCE AGAIN IF IF YOU CAN'T MEASURE IT YOU CAN'T MANAGE IT. AND IF IF IF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE IGNORED IN THE EVALUATION THEN YOU'RE REALLY MISSING A PART OF HOW YOU CAN USE MONIES. RIGHT TO PUT A GRAB BAR IN SOMEBODY'S PLACE TO DO THE RAMP TO GET UP TO THE HOUSE TO OPEN UP THE DOORWAYS TO MAYBE CHANGE THE HEIGHT OF THE SINKS IN THE BATHROOMS. WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING. ALRIGHT WELL I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL AND. THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND AND THE ALL THE. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT JOINED IN THIS IS A VERY INFORMATIVE AND. I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE SOME PUBLIC'S SPEAKERS HAS SO I MIGHT GO AHEAD AND CALL YOU FORWARD. AND. THANK YOU VETERAN SITE FIGURED LET THEM AT LEAST KIND OF HAVE A MOMENT TO. REYES SYNDROME. A TERRORIST ALL SPEAKS VOTE. AND AND. WORKING AT A LIMIT TWO TO THREE MINUTES. BLAMES JOHN DUNBAR THE MAYOR OF THE TOWN THE OUT THOUGH. APPRECIATE. NOW CHAIR AND. MANY MEMBERS GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THE THREE MINUTE SNEAK ON THE OUT THE HOME IN PARTICULAR. WE ARE SEEING A GENERATIONAL SHIFT IN OUR VETERAN POPULATION. THE POPULATION BY THE WAY IS ONE THIRD OF OUR TOWN OF YALTA RESIDENTS IT'S ABOUT A THOUSAND. MEMBERS OF THE HOME. AND BRING WITH THEM IS A NEEDED CHANGE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT SERVICES AND FACILITIES. GIVEN THAT REALITY WE NEED TO IDENTIFY HOW TO DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OUT PATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS ADDICTION THERAPY. HOUSING CHOICES AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR VETERANS WHO MAY NOT NEED OR WANT DOMICILIARY LIFESTYLE. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STEPS ARE LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE TO CARE FOR OUR VETERANS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. IS TO SUPPORT NEW HOUSING ON THE ALTO CAMPUS. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION WITH HOUSING FOR VETERANS. CARE GIVING STAFF AND THE LOCAL NAPA VALLEY WORKFORCE. THE TIMING IS IDEAL TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS WITH GOVERNOR BROWN'S MAJOR COMMITMENT IN HIS BUDGET FOR VETERANS SERVICES AND FACILITIES. AND THE HOUSING BILL PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR VETERANS. MANY OF THE MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OF THE AWFUL HOME. FIND HOUSING AFFORDABLE AFFORDABILITY ELUSIVE SO THEY DRIVE OVER AN HOUR EACH DAY TO GET TO WORK. THIS HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES ON CHILDCARE SCHOOLING FAMILY LIFE AND COMMUNITY BALANCE. AS OF LAST WEEK APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED JOBS AT THE HOME REMAINED UNFILLED IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE COST OF LIVING IN NAPA COUNTY. BUILDING A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND OTHER SUPPORT FACILITIES IS CRITICAL I AGREE. SO IS THE ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR QUALIFIED STAFF. WILL PROVIDE THE MEDICAL CARE. SUPPORT OF THE COMMISSION'S REVIEW OF THE HOME I'VE REACHED OUT TO LOCAL PARTNERS INCLUDING. THE WORK FORCE ALLIANCE OF THE NORTH BAY THE GAS OR FOUNDATION NAPA UNIFIED INSANE HOLE IN THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND CAPITAL INVESTORS WHO ARE EAGER TO HELP THE STATE EXECUTE MEANINGFUL POSITIVE CHANGE FOR OUR VETERANS. TODAY THE TOWN'S INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS ON THE VETERAN SOME GROUNDS THAT'S TODAY. WELL THAT WOULD INCLUDE A MIX OF SINGLE FAMILY IN MULTIPLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. POLICIES CAN BE PUT IN PLACE THAT ALLOW VETERANS AND EMPLOYEES TO RECEIVE PRIORITY. TO QUALIFY FOR THIS OF MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS AN ADDED BENEFIT THIS IS NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT STATE FUNDING UP FRONT. STEAD PRIVATE INVESTMENT CAN BE USED. CAP AND TRADE FUNDS ALSO CAN BE USED THROUGH NONPROFIT OR FOUNDATION PARTNERS. TO OFFSET COSTS FOR ENERGY SAVING BUILDING PRACTICES. BOTH CALAVERAS FACILITIES MASTER PLAN AND THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S OWN REPORT. IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL OF JUST SUCH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE HOME. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHICH CHECK OFF SEVERAL BOXES STATED AS PRIORITIES BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE PROXIMITY HOUSING. SUPPORT OF MODERN VETERAN SERVICES SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION. ECONOMIC DIVERSITY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. ZERO NET ENERGY BUILDING AND THE ADOPTION OF BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE EFFECTIVE EFFICIENT AND SUBSTANTIAL. THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP BY SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FUNDING FOR OUR VETERANS AND BY ALLOWING THE HOME TO ENTER INTO LONG TERM LEASES. AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. THAT WOULD WELCOME PRIVATE INVESTMENT. WE CAN CREATE A MODEL THAT WOULD BE A GOLD STANDARD FOR ALL THE VETERANS HOMES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHILE ADVANCING THE CORE MISSION OF SERVING OUR VETERANS. AND I JUST VERY QUICKLY TO ADD IN REFERENCE TO COMMENTS MADE BY THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THERE IS A OF A PROGRAM CALLED THE PATHWAY HOME THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS. IN ONE THE BUILDINGS AT THE VETERANS HOME IT PROVIDES HOUSING EDUCATION TRAINING AND TREATMENT FOR POST NINE ELEVEN VETERANS. AND HELP SUPPORT THEIR EDUCATION TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. WE ARE COLLECTING DATA ON THEIR OUTCOMES AND IT'S BELIEVE OR NOT A COLLABORATION WITH THE FEDERAL VA CALVET AND PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IF YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JAMES MADISON I'M A HOME MEMBER AT THE ON FIELD HOME THIRTEEN AND ONE HALF YEARS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A VERY BRIEF COMMENT? READING FROM CHAIRMAN IN OFFICE DECEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY FIFTEEN LETTER.
