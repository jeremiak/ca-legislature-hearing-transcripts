AND LOSSES OF HOMES AND BUILDINGS THIS IS A VERY COSTS AND LOSSES FROM WILDFIRES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS HAVE BEEN WIDELY REPORTED BY RESEARCHERS. THE PRESS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. TODAY I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE PATH WE HAVE CHARTED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS AND HOW THAT PLAN COMPLEMENTS THE EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE STATE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT WILDFIRE RESPONSE AGENTS. WITH HOME AND COMMUNITY HARDER CRUCIAL TO REDUCING LOSSES IN SAVING LIVES. BUT WHAT ACTION SHOULD EACH HOMEOWNER TAKING HOW SHOULD THEY BIND TOGETHER WITH THEIR COMMUNITY TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISKS. IN TRUTH MISTER CAR LARA HAS HELD MEETINGS WITH THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THIRTY SIX COUNTIES. HE'S HEARD FROM HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITY. THE FIRST SIGNS OF A MAP THAT CAPTURES A SNAPSHOT OF THAT INFORMATION IN THOSE MEETINGS AND ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FOR NEW HOMES CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT BUILDING CODES RELATED TO WILDFIRE SAFETY KNOWN AS A CHAPTER SEVEN A BUILDING CODES. FOR EXISTING HOMES THAT WERE NOT BUILT TO THE STANDARDS WE NEED A CONSISTENT AND CLEAR APPROACH TO REDUCING RISK. THREE YEARS AGO LESS THAN 7% OF THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET HAVE ACCESS TO INSURANCE INCENTIVES NAMELY PREMIUM DISCOUNTS FOR HAVING TAKEN HOME HARDING ACTIONS. IT'S DIFFICULT INCENTIVIZE BROAD SCALE WHILE PERMEATION MEASURES WITHOUT CONSISTENT AND SHE WILL GUIDANCE TO HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES. TO CLARIFY THE INCENTIVES TO ADAPT OUR COMMUNITIES FOR MORE INTENSE HIGHER SEVERITY WILDFIRES COMMISSIONER HELD THE FIRST INVESTIGATORY HEARING NO WILDFIRES IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'VE SKEWS ME TWENTY TWENTY.

THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL THESE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL AS HAS THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CONSUMERS CONSUMER GROUPS RESEARCHERS OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT AS WELL. THIS INCLUDING A POLICY HOLDERS WHOSE WILDFIRE RISK AND ASSET PROTECTION PROPOSAL WAS TRUE A TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PROCESS IN THE BOX FROM UNITED WHOLESALERS OR TESTIFY LATER ON THIS PANEL. ALSO THE WORK OF THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR BUILDING FOR BUSINESS AND HOME SAFETY I. B. H. S. THE DEVELOPER WALTER PREPARED HOME PROGRAM. ALIGNS WITH THE SAFE FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK. I'M NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH THE FRAMEWORK AND PUT UP SLIDES THAT THEN MAYOR- WHAT I'M GOING TO VERBALLY SAY. YES THAT WAS THREE THREE LAYERS OF PROTECTION. FOR THE STRUCTURE FOR THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS AND FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE THE SAVER FROM WILDFIRES FOR INFOSYS FOCUSES ON A CLASS A. FIRE RATED ROOF. MAINTAINING A FIVE FOOT NUMBER RESISTANCE ZONE AROUND THE HOME INCLUDING FENCING THAT FALLS WITHIN THAT FIVE FEET. A NON COMBUSTIBLE SIX INCHES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE EXTERIOR WALLS. AMBER AND FIRE RESISTANT BANDS UPGRADED WINDOWS ENCLOSE THE- TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK IN THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS THERE FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK IDENTIFIES. VEGETATION AND DEBRIS FROM UNDER DAX REMOVAL OF COMBUSTIBLE SHEDS AND OTHER OUTBUILDINGS FROM IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS OF THE HOME TO AT LEAST A DISTANCE OF THIRTY FEET. AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE COMPLIANCE INCLUDING TRIMMING TREES REMOVAL BRUSH AND DEBRIS FROM THE YARD IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW OR LOCAL ORDINANCE. WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY THE WATER MITIGATION PART YOU'RE RECOGNIZED SEVERAL COURT OPINION WHICH SHE COMMUNICATION ALONG WITH. A CLEARLY DEFINED BOUNDARIES AND A LOCAL RISK ASSESSMENT IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DISTRICT OR STATE FIRE AGENCY. AND IDENTIFIED EVACUATION ROUTE IMPLANTS. INCLUDE FUNDING SOURCES TO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY MITIGATION ACTIVITIES ANY RISK REDUCTION GOALS. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE BETWEEN DESIGNATION AS A FIREWISE USA COMMUNITY IN GOOD STANDING AS RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION ASSOCIATION AND THAT INCLUDES HAVING UPDATED RISK ASSESSMENT IN AN UPDATED COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN. LOOKING FOR THE WATER MITIGATION PARTNERSHIP ALSO IDENTIFIED THE FIRE RISK REDUCTION COMMUNITY DESIGNATION AS ESTABLISHED IN PUBLIC RESOURCES CORD FORTY TWO NINETY POINT ONE WHICH IS UNDER DEVELOPED BY THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. IN CLOSING I HAVE I HAVE THREE POINTS I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE. FIRST MAKING COMMUNITIES SAFER SAVES LIVES AND REDUCES LOSSES. SECOND BECAUSE RISK DRIVE THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE WE REDUCE RISKS. WE'LL SEE IMPROVEMENT ON BOTH PRICE AND ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH WILDFIRE RISKS. IN THIRD AS A RESULT OF WORK OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE NOW HAVE SEVENTEEN HOME OWNERS INSURANCE COMPANIES TODAY AND COUNTING OFFERING DISCOUNTS FOR HOME GARDENING ACTION. THESE COMPANIES REPRESENT 40% OF THE MARKET UP FROM JUST 7% THREE YEARS AGO. THE SAVIOR FROM WILDFIRES PRIMER PROVIDES ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND CONSISTENT APPROACH TO STRENGTHEN SENTENCE FURTHER MAKING COMMUNITIES SAFER AND MORE RESILIENT. HAVING IDENTIFIED THESE POINTS OF CONSENSUS WE'RE FOCUSING ON PUTTING THIS FRAMEWORK INTO ACTION THROUGH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND EDUCATION INCLUDING DURING WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS MONTH IN MAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION WE WILL NOW MOVE OVER TO OUR SECOND PANELIST. WE WILL INVITE NOW- TO JOIN US FROM CAL FIRE DANIEL BERLAND ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHIEF OF COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION MR BERLIN YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. YEAH THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING NATURAL REVEAL ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AS MENTIONED I DO ANYMORE LAND A CHIEF OF CAL FIRE'S COMMUNITY WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS AND MITIGATION DIVISION AT TODAY I'M GONNA PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH AN OVERVIEW OF CAL FIRE'S ACTIVITIES DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON- INVESTMENTS IN OUR FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR GRANT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS OUR ROLE IN THE SAFER FROM WILDFIRE FRAMEWORK THAT MR PETERSON I'M JUST A LAID OUT OUT FIRST THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- OVERGROWN FORESTS AND PROLONGED DROUGHT HAVE RESULTED IN UNPRECEDENTED TREE MORTALITY WITHIN OUR STATE'S FOREST AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NOT ONLY THE NUMBER BUT THE SIZE AND THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THEFACTS HAVE LED TO YEAR AFTER YEAR SIGNIFICANT AND RECORD BREAKING WILDFIRES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS- CALIFORNIA HAS EXPERIENCED NOT ONLY THE LARGEST WILDFIRES IN OUR RECORDED HISTORY BUT SOME OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE. LAST YEAR THERE WERE NEARLY NINE THOUSAND WILDFIRES ACROSS THE STATE THAT BURNED OVER TWO POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES FOR COMPARISON- THAT'S LARGER THAN THE AREA OF THE STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND DELAWARE PUT TOGETHER. THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WILDFIRE YEAR. IS WELL UNDER WAY WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT WE SAW RECORD RAINFALL LAST YEAR AT THE END OF THE YEAR. BUT OUR LUCK SEEMS TO HAVE RUN OUT IS JANUARY FEBRUARY HAVE DRIED OUT. ALREADY THIS YEAR OUR FIREFIGHTERS HAVE RESPONDED. TO OVER SIX HUNDRED WILDFIRES THAT HAVE ALREADY BURNED NEARLY SIX THOUSAND ACRES- THIS INCLUDES A NEARLY SEVEN THOUSAND. NOT NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED ACRE WILDFIRE ALONG THE COAST NEAR BIG SUR- THAT WAS BACK IN JANUARY AND THEN- JUST LAST MONTH THE FOUR THOUSAND PLUS ACRE WILDFIRE JUST EAST OF BISHOP. THE DESPITE OUR RECORD SETTING FIRE SEASON SO CAL FIRE HAS CONTINUED ITS FOCUS UPON INCREASING THE PACE AND SCALE OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AS A KEY ELEMENT. IN OUR BATTLE AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY WILDFIRE. A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR WILDFIRE STRATEGY CONTINUES TO STRESS THE NEED TO ENSURE COMMUNITIES ARE PREPARED FOR WILDFIRE BY BUILDING AND RETROFITTING HOMES WITH EMBER RESISTANT BUILDING MATERIALS. VOLUNTARY HOMES HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE WITH A MINIMUM OF A HUNDRED FEET OF CLEARANCE FROM DRIVE EDUCATION. NOW THANKS TO A MULTI YEAR FUNDING ALLOCATIONS ARE DESIGNATED AND SENATOR ROD JUST BE NINE A ONE FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN CAL FIRE'S BUDGET. CALIFORNIA HAS CONTINUED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ASSISTING COMMUNITIES MAKE THESE MITIGATION EFFORTS. LAST FALL WE AWARDED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN LOCAL WILDFIRE PREVENTION GRANTS FOR FUEL REDUCTION WILDFIRE PLANNING AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. JUST LAST MONTH WE CLOSED AN ADDITIONAL SOLICITATION PERIOD FOR GRANTS FOR AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE PLAN TO AWARD AT THE LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS LATER THIS SPRING. A PER A SIMPLY BILL THIRTY EIGHT AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOOD IN TWENTY NINETEEN ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CALLAWAY YES WE HAVE BEEN BUSY DEVELOPING A NEW HOME HARDENING RETROFIT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS GET HELP IN HARDENING THEIR HOMES AGAINST THE EMBERS AND FLAMES OF WILDFIRES. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EXCUSE ME WILDFIRE FOREST RESILIENCE PACKAGE ALSO AUGMENTED CAL FIRE'S LOCAL UNIT FUNDING- WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR FUEL BREAKS AND FUEL REDUCTION IN AROUND COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA ARGUABLY HAS THE MOST STRINGENT BUILDING CODES IN THE WORLD SPECIFICALLY FOR WILDLAND AREA. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NEW CONSTRUCTION IN CALIFORNIA HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS REQUIRE BUILDING MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE AMBER RESISTANCE. NOW WE'RE CONSTANTLY REEVALUATING THESE REQUIREMENTS AND ADOPTING THE ATEST BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES STANDARDS AND MATERIALS. FROM THIS COLD WE DEVELOPED A LIST OF LOW COST RETROFITS TO PROVIDE RELATIVELY CHEAP AND EASY UPGRADES THAT RESIDENTS CAN MAKE ON THEIR OWN- TO INCREASE THEIR HOMES CHANCE OF SURVIVAL. THIS LIST IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TODAY OUR WEBSITE READY FOR WILDFIRE RESPONSIBLE FOR NUMEROUS FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS AS THE STATE'S FIRE DEPARTMENT WE ARE EXPERTS IN FIRE BEHAVIOR IN CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPE. OVER THE PAST YEARS WE HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS TO BUILD THE SAFER FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK THE MISTER PETERSON- MENTION.

REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK IS A SHARED FOCUS AMONG THE PARTNERS- AND THIS UNIFIED WORK STRENGTHENS RISK REDUCTION IN PREPAREDNESS IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY. THE SAFER FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK IS IN LINE WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE BEST PRACTICES AS WELL AS THE LATEST SCIENCE AND RESEARCH INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT HAVE TREMENDOUS IN HOUSE EXPERIENCE IN VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF WILDFIRE MITIGATON. NOW WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES BUT HAVING A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT IS ACHIEVABLE. AND EFFECTIVE WILL HELP US SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT HOMES AND BUSINESSES. SENDING A UNIFIED MESSAGE TO CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS IS CRITICAL IN TRULY BECOMING SAFER. THE FRAMEWORK WORKS WITH CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING WILDFIRE STRATEGY INCLUDING STANDARDS FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE. THE MEASURES LISTED IN FAVOR OF WILDFIRES WILL BE HELPFUL TO OUR FIREFIGHTERS BY REDUCING RISK TO STRUCTURES FREEING UP RESOURCES. AS WE PREPARE FOR ANOTHER POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE FIRE SEASON AND REALLY A FIRE YEAR IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURES ARE CONSIDERED IN NOT ONLY INSURANCE AVAILABILITY BUT ALSO IN INCENTIVES.

SO WHY IS MY LITTLE ORGANIZATION HERE- IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A- SUBSTANTIAL ROLE OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN HELPING- WITH. KEEPING THE MOMENTUM GOING THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT TODAY I'M WE ARE FIVE ONE C. THREE WE HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE RIGHT AROUND THE TIME OF THE OAKLAND BERKELEY FIRE. SO AND- IN THIS VERY FOCUSED ON WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS AND RECOVERY- THE RAP PROGRAM THAT YOU HEARD MIKE PETERSON REFERENCE WHICH STANDS FOR WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION IN ASSET PROTECTION INITIATIVE. IS UNDER OUR- SORT OF CROSSES ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS RECOVERY AND ADVOCACY- IT IS AN OUTGROWTH- HELLO. WE GOT WE WERE CONTACTED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS AROUND CALIFORNIA. SHORTLY AFTER THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS WAS EMERGING. AND OPTIONS WERE SHRINKING FOR HOMEOWNERS AND BECAUSE I'M INVOLVED AND AT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS AS AN- OFFICIAL CONSUMER REP THERE. I HAD BEEN WORKING STARTING IN ABOUT TWENTY FIFTEEN WITH SOME OF THE HURRICANE PRONE STATES- ON THEIR INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS AND THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY WERE OFFERING. TO FACILITATE RISK REDUCTION AND INSURANCE REWARDS I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THERE SO WHEN WE STARTED- TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE HERE AND NOW IN CALIFORNIA WHO WERE LOSING INSURANCE AND- HAVING AND- THEY ARE THEY'RE- NOT QUITE KNOWING WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. WE LAUNCHED THIS INITIATIVE- AND WE HAVE BANNED NOW I THINK WE'RE ON OUR NINETEENTH MEETING OF CONVENING STAKEHOLDERS AND WE'VE HAD- REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE AGENCIES THAT YOU'VE JUST HEARD FROM- WE HAVE HAD I. D. H. S. SOME OF THE VENDORS THAT ARE- DOING RISK REDUCTION HAVE PRESENTED TO US S. D. INSIDE CHINA. AND SO- BUT MOSTLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IS JUST TRYING TO GATHER INFORMATION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THESE FOUR GOALS AND REDUCING RISK RESTORING HOME INSURANCE AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY. AND AND ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR EXISTING HOMES- SO THAT THERE WOULD BE A BENCHMARK. TO MEASURE AND INSURER IN GAUGE AND THE FINANCE REWARDS WE KNOW THAT ARE SO CALLED. TO MAKE IT BOTH- AND TRACTIVE TO HOMEOWNERS TO INVEST TIME AND MONEY IN RISK REDUCTION- BUT AT BUT ALSO TO MAKE IT FINANCIALLY WORTHWHILE FOR. BOTH IN TERMS OF HAVING THEIR HOMES- AND BE EASIER TO INSURE BUT ALSO HAVING THEIR HOMES- MAINTAIN THEIR VALUE TO REAL ESTATE VALUE- AS A AS A- A SAFER FROM WILDFIRE HOLDER WHICH REDUCE HOME. SO I FOCUS NOW A WE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS WITH HELP FROM A LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE HERE- IS VERY MUCH ON NOW THE NUTS AND BOLTS SO- BUILDING FINANCIAL IMPACT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OPTIONS. AND I JUST REALLY CONTINUING TO BUILD ON THE AMAZING WORK THAT FIRE SAFE GROUPS FIREWISE GROUPS. ARE DOING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THAT CAL FIRE AND LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AT A LOCAL LEVEL TO HELP THEIR HOMEOWNERS KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND HOW TO DO IT YEAH AND THEN B. A LOT OF LOCAL FIRE AGENCIES HAD BEEN A GO BETWEEN BETWEEN HOMEOWNERS AND THEIR INSURERS TO GIVE THE INSURERS SOME. COMFORT THAT THIS IS A BETTER THAN AVERAGE RISK EVEN THOUGH IT IS IN THE MOVIE SO- OUR WORKING GROUP PUT OUT- THIS IS A SERIES OF RECOMMENDED STEPS- LAST FALL. THEN I DHS PUT THEIRS OUT THE INTERAGENCY PARTNERSHIP BUT THERE IS OUT IN THIS CHART HELPS YOU SEE THERE'S TREMENDOUS OVERLAP YOU KNOW THIS TIME OF THIS MORNING'S HEARING I HOPE WILL BE A FEEL GOOD FOR EVERYONE THERE'S A LOT OF BAD NEWS OUT THERE BUT ON THIS TOPIC- THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT. OF OF CLEAN BY I'D SAY I THINK THE INSURERS ARE COMING- UNDER OUR TEN I THINK YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL KIND F SEEM TO BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOGETHER. SO WE DO HAVE- STILL OF COURSE LOTS OF WORK TO BE HE DIED BUT THERE'S A LOT. OF BETWEEN WHAT THIS. ARE SAYING. IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING WILDFIRE RISK WHICH AT THE END OF THE DAY. IS REALLY THE KEY HERE IS TO GIVE YOU KNOW GIVE INSURERS THAT CONFIDENCE- THAT- YOU KNOW TO INVEST IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THEN TO. TO GIVE PEOPLE REWARDS SO. I HAVE A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THROUGH THE RAP PROGRAM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. HAS BEEN- GATHERING INFORMATION SO THIS IS JUST FROM ONE OF OUR THIS THIS AND THIS WEEK'S MEETING- WE HEARD FROM THREE OF THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- THAT ARE. THAT HAVE PROGRAMS GOING IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION FROM THEM ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THE GROUND AND THERE'S A LOT OF. REALLY GOOD WORK GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES CREATIVE WORK- AND COLLABORATIVE WORK. SO JUST A FEW OTHER THINGS- MY ORGANIZATION WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE- WE'VE WE DO A LOT OF CONSUMER EDUCATION- TO HELP PEOPLE FIND INSURANCE OPTIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO- TAKE THE PULSE OF THE PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET PLACE TO SURVEY- THAT WE HAVE GOING ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS HELPING US WITH THAT. AS OUR PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND- ALL THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AS WELL SO WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING ON THEIR OWN. AND WHAT KIND OF STANDARDS THEY ARE USING IN THEIR LOCAL PROGRAMS- AND THEN WE ARE DOING SOME WORK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND JUST TO SEE YOU KNOW KEEP TABS ON WHAT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S JUST THREE MAIN APPROACHES THAT OTHER STATES HAVE TAKEN THERE ARE LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED RISK REDUCTION DISCOUNTS- THERE ARE LEGISLATIVE. LEE MANDATED NOTICES AND OFFERS NOT NECESSARILY A PRESCRIBED- DISCOUNT BUT AT- A REQUIREMENT THAT INSURERS DO SOME KIND OF. RECOGNITION AND THEN OF COURSE IS THERE SOME AMAZING. VOLUNTARY PROGRAMS- THE FIREWISE USA FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- IT'S SUCH A- WE HAVE A LITTLE PILOT GOING IN SAN DIEGO WITH THE COUNTY AND- A LOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS YOU KNOW JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WHERE TO GET HOW TO GET THE MONEY INTO THE HANDS. OF COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS- IT ALSO AND HOW TO SOLVE THOSE KIND OF. THE CHALLENGES- WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ONE HOMEOWNERS DO SOMETHING IT REALLY HAS TO BE- POSSIBLE. SO IT HAS TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY LEVEL IN ORDER TO GIVE INSURERS THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY NEED- SO NEXT STEPS WE NEED TO FINALIZE THE REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT IS PUT UT THEY'VE BEEN DOING REALLY GOOD WORK. AND BEING VERY THOUGHTFUL THEY'VE GONE A COUPLE ROUNDS OF ISSUED THEIR THEIR DEPENDING RAG SO THEY REALLY HAVE TRIED VERY HARD TO LISTEN TO ALL THE PARTIES- AND WE ARE SUPPORTING THOSE REGULATIONS STRONGLY. AS ARE A LOT OF OUR FIRE SAFE COUNCIL FOLKS AND PARTNERS. WE HAVE NOT SOME BOLTS TO FIGURE OUT AS TO WHO DOES THE INSPECTIONS WHOSE CERTIFIES THAT A HOME IS. SAFER FROM WILDFIRES- AND THEN OF COURSE- INSURERS I HAVE TO ADAPT TO- THIS THIS. NEW SITUATION. AND YOU'VE HEARD THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY COMING IN NOW FROM THE FANS- AND FROM THE STATE. SO THOSE ARE ALL I'M I THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE COUP BY YA RIGHT SO THAT THAT WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- AND JUST TO CLOSE BY SAYING THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE WORK THAT.

THROUGHOUT THESE AREAS AND WE KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW THE BACKBONE OF THE INSURANCE BUSINESS AND HOW IT WORKS- I'VE BEEN NOTICING IN MY AREAS THAT- ALL. IT SEEMS THAT A LOT OF THE CANCELLATION NOTICES AND EVERYTHING AND BECOMING BY- ZIP CODES. IN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN A LOT OF THESE VIRUSES ARE SO SMALL THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME ZIP CODE PRACTICALLY. ELISE COUNTY BY COUNTY SO NO MY COUNTY NAPA COUNTY SOLANO COUNTY YOLO COUNTY THEY EACH ONLY HAD MAYBE ONE OR TWO ZIP CODES AND THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. IT DOES HI PRONE FIRE AREAS. SO MY QUESTION BECOMES OKAY. THESE FIRE WISE COUNSELS AS MISS BAKIT- POINTED OUT ARE REALLY DOING A GREAT JOB WE'RE GETTING MONEY OUT IN THESE AREAS. WHO IS IT ALTERNATELY THAT CERTIFIES LET'S JUST SAY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN'T DO IT BY ZIP CODE.

WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF CLEARING HOUSE BOB WHAT'S GETTING DONE SO THIS INFORMATION OR MAYBE THE POT ALL TO BELIEVE WHEN SOMEBODY'S- AREAS CERTIFIED MAYBE THE HOMEOWNER HAS A CERTIFICATION AND THEY- YOU KNOW GIVE IT TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY STILL NOT CLEAR ON THAT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT THERE YET BUT- I JUST KIND OF WANT TO. PRESUPPOSE SOME POSSIBILITIES TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR EVERYBODY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO COMMENT. OR RESPOND TO MR DOT PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS- ANY OTHER PANELISTS WISHING TO MAKE A COMMENT. I'M HAPPY TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT THANK YOU GO AHEAD UP. AMY BACH AND YOU KNOW SENATOR JOHN SPOT ON- INSURERS HAVE BEEN. GENERALLY SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONES. TO GO OUT AND DO REPEATED INSPECTIONS I KNOW THAT I. D. H. S. HAS A CONCEPT I UNDERSTAND THEY WERE HERE- RECENTLY MEETING- WITH SOME OF OUR FIRE- FIREFIGHTING PROFESSIONALS BUT- I DON'T KNOW HOW DETAILED I DON'T KNOW IF SHE FOR LAND IS ABLE TO SHARE. IT HOW GRANULAR THEIR PLAN IS- FOR THEM HAVING THE INSPECTION FORCE- BUT I KNOW THEY THEY OF THE ONLY PEOPLE I'VE HEARD OF THAT HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN BEING THE ONES TO DO THE- THE INSPECTIONS BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THROUGH WHETHER THEY WANT TO USE LIKE THE SAME PEOPLE THAT GO OUT AND DO- PROPERTY APPRAISALS FOR- MORTGAGES I DON'T KNOW. IF I COULD- TAG ON AGAIN NOT GETTING BLANKED WITHOUT CAL FIRE. CENTER DOT TV TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION OBVIOUSLY WE PROVIDE PERSONAL LEVEL INSPECTIONS- AS PART OF OUR DEFENSE WILL SPACE PROGRAM WE PROVIDE. A HOME HARDING- TIPS- IS A PART OF THAT BUT HOW DO YOU DEFINE THE COMMUNITY- YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED ZIP CODE AT FIRST- CENSUS TRACT- DEFINING THE COMMUNITY IS THE COMPLEX ON. THE ITEM THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON AS AMY MENTIONED- I. B. H. S. WHICH IS THE NONPROFIT AND RESEARCH ARM OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WAS OUT HERE- JUST LAST WEEK WE ARE MEETING WITH THEM AND- THEY ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH US AND WITH. A NUMBER OF STAKEHOLDERS. IN THE FIRE MITIGATION WORLD TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT IN HALF AND TO FIND THAT I POINT OUT A COUPLE ITEMS THOUGH. AS WAS MENTIONED BY NUMBER THE SPEAKERS N. F. PA'S FIREWISE COMMUNITIES IS MORE OR LESS THAT SELF CERTIFICATION AND RECOGNITION PROGRAM- THAT THAT THAT DEFINES ALLOWS THE HOMEOWNERS AS A GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO KIND OF DEFINE WHAT THEIR COMMUNITY LOOKS LIKE- THE BOARD OF FORESTRY- IS ALSO WORKING. TO DEVELOP A NEW- FIRE RISK REDUCTION COMMUNITY- CERTIFICATION THAT'S STILL UNDER THE REGULATORY- PROCESS RIGHT NOW SO THEY'RE WORKING TO HIT WERE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEFINE THAT. BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE AND I THINK ANOTHER AVENUE OF AGAIN FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD CERTIFICATION THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS MEETING THE COMMUNITY WIDE LEVEL OF PERSPECTIVE WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED. FOR YEARS ON INSURING THAT HOMEOWNERS ARE DOING THEIR PART BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IN IN MANY OF THESE WILDFIRES IS THAT- JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE YOUR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT YOUR HOME IS GOING TO SURVIVE A WILDFIRE IF YOUR NEIGHBOR ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIVE IN A DENSE AREA OF YOUR NEIGHBORS CLOSE BY. IF YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS NOT DONE DEFENSIBLE SPACE IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S HOME IS NOT BUILT OR RETROFITTED IN THEIR HOME IGNITES ON FIRE IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT IT'S GOING TO SPREAD TO YOUR HOME SO. TAKING TAKING A STEP BACK AWAY FROM THE PARCEL. AND LOOKING AT THE COMMUNITY IT'S SO. IS THE FOCUS NOW MR PETER DID I MENTION AS WELL THAT IS A COMPLETE. OF THE SAFER FOR WILDFIRES- THE WILDFIRE- PROGRAM A LET HIM OBVIOUSLY TALK MORE ABOUT THAT BUT- I GUESS I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. YES THE QUESTION SOULS WHO CERTIFIES IT BUT I WOULDN'T I WOULD NOTE THAT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION- FIREWISE COMMUNITIES AND I. B. H. S. I THINK ALL ARE LOOKING AT. SOME LEVEL OF DESIGNATION FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MEETING ALL OF THESE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THANK YOU FOR THAT MR DOT YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION YES I APPRECIATE BOTH OF THOSE THE ANSWERS- I WOULD STRESS THAT- GETTING SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION TO THAT. AND HOW THAT'S DONE FOR CERTIFICATION IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR YOUR QUESTION I'LL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR ARCHULETA YOU HAVE A QUESTION YES THANK YOU MANAGER KEPT QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS- I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. I THINK JENNER DOG BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT- WHEN YOU HAVE HOMEOWNERS SHOULD CAN- ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE RULES BE THE GOOD GUYS. AND MAYBE THIRTY FORTY FIFTY FEET- CLEAR AROUND THEIR PROPERTY CLEAR IN AND BO. BE AWARE OF. IT'S A HUNDRED YOU'RE LUCKY TO GET A HUNDRED. SO I'M SAYING LUCKY TO GET A HUNDRED BUT IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY GETS TO THAT LEVEL TWO HUNDRED FEET- WHICH IS QUITE DIFFICULT AND THERE'S NO DOUBT BUT IF THEY DO- CAN THEY TAKE PHOTOS AND SEND IT TO THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY WITH THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES AND BE ABLE TO REDUCE THEIR- THEIR ANNUAL FEES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE GOOD GUYS DOING SOMETHING TO PREVENT FIRES. AND ALSO SHOW THAT THEY'VE GOT- THE FIRE DETECTION EQUIPMENT AND OTHER- EXTINGUISHERS IN THE HOUSE SOME WAY TO DO PARTICIPATE SO THEY CAN RECEIVE- A LESSER RATE AND THEY CAN DO THAT BY PHOTOS I DON'T EXPECT THAT THE INSURANCE AGENT TO GO OUT TO EACH AND EVERY HOUSE. BUT MAYBE THEY COULD DO IT THAT WAY THAT'S ONE IF THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE THE OTHER THING IS I'D LIKE TO- COMPLIMENT ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA CAL FIRE'S BEEN PARTICULARLY THERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE- LOS ANGELES COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF THE OTHER FIRE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE AROUND- DOWN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT- WORKING WITH WAIT HERE- THERE WAS A HUGE FIRE TO HOMES. WERE WERE- DAMAGE IT WAS BECAUSE OF OUR SIN IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF- THE BRUSH AND THE TREES AND SO ON IT WAS RSON BUT WHAT I HAVE TO COMPLIMENT ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS WITH IS THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE PARTICIPATED AND AIR DROPS AND- EQUIPMENT IT WAS AMAZING WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IN A SHORT TIME DISTINGUISH THAT FIRE. AND PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE TO MORE HOMES ONLY TWO WERE DAMAGED SHOW UP IT IS SO IMPORTANT WE DON'T FORGET OUR COMMUNITY FIREFIGHTERS WORKING IN THE INNER CITY AND WORKING- WITH US AND- MADAM CHAIR I BELIEVE YOUR DISTRICT AT SOUTH EL MONTE HAD A HUGE FIRE THERE ON ROSEMEAD BOULEVARD THAT COULD ASSIST AT. TO THE DUTCH AREA IN THE FIRE FIRE DEPARTMENTS- QUICKLY CONVERGE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND EXTINGUISH THAT. SO COMPLIMENTS ON THAT BUT GOING BACK TO- THE HOMEOWNERS I THINK THAT THEY NEED HELP AS MUCH AS WE CAN. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION. IT WHEN WE HAD ALL THESE FIRES JUST MOST RECENTLY WITH FEMA INVOLVED DO WE GET THE RESULTS FROM FEMA WE WERE ASKING FOR. IF ANYONE CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS I'D APPRECIATE THANK YOU MR TAYLOR FOR YOUR QUESTION ANYONE WANT TO TAKE THE LAST QUESTION IS ABOUT FEMA. PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND. MR BURRIS YOU MAY PROCEED. THANKS I THANK SENATOR SO IN REGARDS TO FEMA- WE HAVE A B. THRESHOLD TO GET ASSISTANCE- IN THIS STATE- IS CURRENTLY SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS- WE NEED TO HAVE AN ESTIMATED DAMAGES TO BART RECEIVE THAT- TO RECEIVE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE UP FULLY AND INDIVIDUAL SUSPENSE BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE- FIRE GRANT AS WELL THE DEATH MAG AND- WE DID RECEIVE QUITE A FEW F. BAGS. LYCEUM HAPPY TO PROVIDE A LAST BIT OF FEMA HAS BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE AND PROVIDE AN ETHNIC SUPPORT WHICH DOES HELP US. RECOUP A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT ROUTE WE ARE SPEND PARTICULARLY EARLY ON AND FIGHT THE FIRES- AND OF COURSE IF THEY- IF WE EXTEMPORANEOUS DISTANCE THERE'D BE NOAS FAR AS- TOOLS AND OUR PEOPLE OF EIGHTY ODD TO- ARRIVED AS WELL WHEN WE DID GET. TO FULL DECLARATIONS LAST YEAR FOR THE AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER FIRES AND EMAIL IS STILL CURRENTLY IN OUR BUILDING HERE- YES WORKING EVERY DAY TRYING TO HELP OUT THE. PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA OKAY ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT- THANK YOU MR. ONE OF THE FOLLOW UP AND ON THAT POSSIBILITY OF THE REDUCTION OF THE- ANNUAL FEES FOR THOSE WHO ADHERE. TO THE RULES OF KEEPING THEIR PROPERTY FREE AND CLEAR FROM DEBRIS. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT SO I'LL JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION AND THAT'S FOR C. D. I. N. N. AND I WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR AGAIN THE SPIRIT OF COLLABORATION I KNOW THAT NOW- YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND BUILD ON WHAT. EACH ARM DEPARTMENT OR AGENCY IS JOINED BY TOM I WANT TO GO BACK TO C. D. I. MIKE PETERSON AND- AMY. ARE BOTH OF YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OUT REACH YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO FIRST OF ALL I THINK INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WE GOT A LOT OF BASED ON THE PRESENTATION HE'S BEEN TO THIRTY SIX COUNTIES. AND HAS HELPED FORTY FIVE VIRTUAL MEETINGS BUT I JUST WANT YOU O SHARE WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN GETTING PEOPLE ENGAGED- MISTRUST I JUST ASKED THE QUESTION. HOW DO WE GET THOSE INDIVIDUAL FOLKS TOM NOT ONLY ENGAGE BUT ALSO TO LEARN ABOUT THESE ISSUES WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND HOW CAN WE HELP. PUT THE INFORMATION OUT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FOR THE QUESTIONS YOUR REVIEW I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS FAVOR FROM WELFARE. FRAMEWORK I GIVE THIS A CONSISTENT APPROACH THAT. MULTIPLE AGENCIES IT ALL WORKS TO CREATE AND SO THAT'S A REALLY EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION TOOL. TO TALK WITH COMMUNITIES ABOUT AS THEY'RE TRYING TO PREPARE. FOR A FUTURE WILDFIRES AND SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WE BY WORKING ON THIS PROJECT. I THINK WE'VE CLARIFIED A LOT OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE OUT THERE IN TERMS OF. YOU KNOW OF THE MANY THINGS YOU COULD DO TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK WHERE SHOULD YOU CONCENTRATE YOUR EFFORTS AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A CONSISTENT APPROACH. YOU WERE REALLY GOING TO BE TRYING TO. THROUGH OUR REGION ENGAGING WITH COMMUNITIES- ISSUE SURE THAT APPROACH AND HELP CONNECT PEOPLE WITH INFORMATION AND SO I THINK THAT THAT. SOME OF THE BIGGEST HELP IS THROUGH THE COMMUNICATION. OF THIS FRAMEWORK- ESPECIALLY HI. PRIOR TO WHEN- FIVE FIRES. ARE GOING TO ACCELERATE IN THE FUTURE I DON'T WANT. YEAH I WOULD YOU PROVIDE SO THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE IN FIRE SEASON RIGHT NOW BUT- BUT THE SOONER WE CAN COMMUNICATE THE SOONER WE CAN MITIGATE- THE MORE IN ADVANCE. OF A FUTURE FIRES WILL BE. THANK YOU. WELL ONCE AGAIN THANK TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR GREAT QUESTIONS. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL- YOU KNOW AS WE CONTINUE TO TACKLE SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND- TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER- NOW WE KNOW THAT. TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EVOLVING AND CHANGING SO OUR SECOND PANEL WILL FOCUS ON EMERGING MITIGATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS. AND SO WE WILL HEAR FROM SOME FOLKS- AT SELECT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO OUR FIRST PANEL. OF FIRST UP IN THE SECOND PANEL WE WILL WANT TO WELCOME MICHAEL MARTINEZ SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER. AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. ONCE AGAIN LED BY COMMISSIONER WE GOT A LOT ON. OUR MISTER MARTINEZ YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO RUBIO. MORNING EVERYONE BY SURGEONS AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON INSURANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME VIRTUALLY HERE TODAY. AGAIN MIKE MARTINEZ SERVICE SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSION REGARDING A LOT OF AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO FOCUS MY REMARKS ON STEPS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE FOR HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES. INCLUDING PENDING ADMINISTRATIVE AND REGULATORY ACTIONS IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE INTENSIFIED. WILDFIRES I WILL BRIEFLY SHARE MY SCREEN. M. IT'S. OKAY SO LATE LAST DECEMBER THE DEPARTMENT PUBLICLY RELEASED DATA REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY NINETY EIGHT POINT 8% OF THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET AND THE STATE THAT CERTAIN INSURANCE COMPANIES NON RENEWED FEWER. HOME OWNERS IN TWENTY TWENTY WHEN COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR OF TWENTY NINETEEN BASICALLY A 10% DROP IN NON RENEWAL STATEWIDE. HOWEVER THAT SAME DATA SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF POLICIES WRITTEN BY THE FAIR PLAN KNOWN AS- THE- NO ES IN THE STATES INSURER OF LAST RESORT INCREASED FOR THE SECOND YEAR TO A NEW HIGH ALTHOUGH THE FAIR PLAN STILL ONLY REPRESENTS LESS THAN 3% OF THE OVERALL STATEWIDE RESIDENTIAL MARKET OF EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION POLICIES TODAY. FURTHERMORE THIS DATA ALSO SUGGESTED THAT MANDATORY HOMEOWNERS MORATORIUM LAW PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY NINETEEN HAS ALSO HELPED CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL DECREASE IN NON RENEWALS. MORE THAN FOUR MILLION POLICY HOLDERS HAVE BEEN PROTECTED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS UNDER THIS LAW THAT BANS GENDER LADA. PROBABLY AUTHORED. PAUL COMMISSIONER LOT OF BELIEVES WE STILL HAVE A WAY TO GO AND STILL WE HAVE AN INSURANCE MARKET THAT IS AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. G. IN THE DEPARTMENT REMAIN FOCUSED ON A SERIES OF COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE SOLUTIONS TO PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SECURE A COMPETITIVE INSURANCE MARKET NAMELY. FIRSTLY PARTNERING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE CONSISTENT STATEWIDE HOME AND COMMUNITY HARDING SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO INSURANCE INCENTIVES. YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE MIKE PETERSON EARLIER IN THIS HEARING SO I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT HE SAID EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THE WALLS ARE PARTNERSHIPS SAFER FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK THAT HE DESCRIBED BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT. AND THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION INCLUDING CALIFORNIA HELLO YES WILL GREATLY HELP INCENTIVIZE BOTH HOME AND COMMUNITY HARDENING EFFORTS STATEWIDE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE LOSSES AND SAVE LIVES. SECONDLY PUSHING TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE OFFERED BY THE ADMITTED HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKETS. SEVERAL INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT DURING THE DEPARTMENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE RATE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS THAT THEY WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE POLICIES WRITTEN IN THE STATE. AND CEASE OR LIMIT NON RENEWALS THESE NEGOTIATIONS WE BELIEVE HAVE BEEN PRODUCTIVE TODAY ARE ONGOING AND THE DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY PUSH FOR MORE NEW ADMITTED INSURANCE COVERAGE AND THE TIMING. NOW IN ADDITION TO CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. THIRDLY INCREASING INSURANCE COMPANY RECOGNITION OF MITIGATION EFFORTS TO PROTECT HOMES BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES. AT COMMISSIONER LOT IS URGING INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED PREMIUM DISCOUNTS FOR COMMUNITY WIDE AND HOME SPECIFIC MITIGATION EFFORTS INCLUDING PROVIDING UP 220% DISCOUNTS FOR WILDFIRE HARDEN HOMES. CURRENTLY WE COUNT SEVENTEEN INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COUNTING REPRESENTING 40% OF INSURANCE MARKET PLACE HAVE ANSWERED THAT COMMISSIONER LET US CALL TO OFFER DISCOUNTS FOR SAFER HOMES IN COMMUNITIES WITH EVEN MORE COMPANIES INTERESTED. THIS FIGURE IS UP FROM JUST 7% OF THE MARKET WHEN COMMISSIONER LOT OF TOOK OFFICE THREE YEARS AGO. FURTHLY ANNOUNCING NEW REGULATIONS THAT WOULD IMPROVE WELFARE SAFETY AND TRANSPARENCY UNDER THESE PROPOSED REGULATIONS WHICH COULD BE IN FACT BY THE END OF THE SUMMER INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE HOMEOWNERS. AND BUSINESSES SAFETY MEDICAID ACTS AS AS HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES WOULD BE ABLE KNOW THEIR WALL RISK WARS AND BE ABLE TO LOOK THAT. THESE REGULATE ADDRESS THAT GERMAN LOT HEARD FROM MANY AND ACROSS THE STATE- WHEN HE UP THE DOZEN OF TOWN HALLS- ACROSS RECOGNIZE THEIR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES EFFORTS TO HARDEN THEIR PROPERTIES AND COMMUNITIES AGAINST WILDFIRE WHILE LOWERING THE RISK OF LOSS AND DAMAGE. FIFTY MODERNIZING THE FAIR PLAN KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE SAFETY NET. SO WHAT BETTER MEANS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES COVERAGE NEEDS. COMMISSIONER LOTTA ORDER THE FAIR PLAN TO RAISE ITS COMMERCIAL HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE LIMITS IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESS USES AND HOMEOWNERS AND KEEP PACE WITH RISING COST MORE THAN TWO DECADES. IN ADDITION GIVEN A RECENT SUPERIOR COURT DECISIONS COMMISSIONER LAUDED CONTINUES TO PUSH. THE FAIR PLAN TO OFFER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE HOMEOWNER'S POLICY OPTION IN ADDITION TO ITS CURRENT FIRE ONLY POLICY COVERAGE IN ORDER TO MEET CONSUMERS. AND MEDIA COVERAGE NEEDS. COMMISSIONER LOTT ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORTED YOUR- RUBIO'S BILL LAST YEAR CHAPTER AND ELEVEN AND MADE IT A HIGH PRIORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE THIS NEW COMMERCIAL COVERAGE TO BE OFFERED TO FARMS AND AGRICULTURAL BUSINESSES AFFECTED NOW- LAST MONTH FEBRUARY FEBRUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SIX THREE- IMPLEMENTING A FIRST OF ITS KIND CLIMATE INSURANCE REPORT TO ME CONTAINING FORTY STATE AND LOCAL POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS PUT TOGETHER BY COMMISSIONER A LOT AS- CALIFORNIA CLIMATE INSURANCE WORKING GROUP OVER TWO YEARS TIME. BUT FOCUS ON REDUCING DAMAGE AND IMPROVING RECOVERY FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. FOLLOWING A WILDFIRE IN ADDITION TO AN EXTREME HEATWAVE OR FIVE MISTER A LOT OF BELIEVES THAT BY ACTING NOW. WE CAN SAVE LIVES AND SAVE COMMUNITIES FROM INCREASING COSTS HELPING PAXSON SOCIAL INEQUITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE ACTIONS AMONG. SEVERAL OTHERS DIED AND HANDING BIKES MISTER LOTT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. ARE NECESSARY TO FURTHER INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE ACROSS THE STATE. ASHLEY HI WILDFIRE RISK AREAS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. COMMISSIONER LOTTE HAS HELD MEETINGS WITH BELLS OF CALIFORNIANS COMMUNITY OR- LOCAL AND BUSINESS GROUPS MORE THAN THIRTY SIX COUNTIES. BUILDING ON AN AREA PUBLIC HERE PUBLIC FORUMS AND TOWN HALLS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN HOPE CO HOSTED WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IN CLOSING WE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE INSURANCE AND COMMISSIONER LANA HOW GREATLY APPRECIATED YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES AND INSURANCE AVAILABILITY. ON CALIFORNIA'S HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESSES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME AGAIN HERE TODAY. THANK YOU MISS MARTINEZ A PLEASE THANK THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND YOUR TEAM AS WELL I KNOW THAT YOU'VE BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING ON. COLLABORATING WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND I'M VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE- DISCOUNTS ALREADY OFFERED AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN CONTINUE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE ON THAT FRONT. OUR NEXT- WE WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR NEXT PANELIST KAREN COLLINS ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF PERSONAL LINES AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. RIGHT THANK YOU- YES MY NAME IS KAREN COLLINS AND I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT FOR SCIENCE WITH THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURER INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OR AS WE CALL IT THE CIA FOR SHORT. ALSO A LONGTIME RESIDENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. MY ORGANIZATION A. P. C. I. A. IS THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR HOME AUTO AND BUSINESS INSURERS. WE WORK TO PROTECT PROMOTE PROTECT THE VIABILITY OF PRIVATE MARKET COMPETITION FOR THE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS AND INSURERS WITH A LEGACY THAT GOES BACK A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS. WE REPRESENT COMPANIES OF ALL SIZES STRUCTURES AND REGIONS TO PROTECT FAMILIES COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESSES IN THE US. AND ALSO AROUND THE GLOBE. MY COMMENTS WILL BRIEFLY COVER SOME OF THE TOOLS ARE INDUSTRY LEVERAGES TO PROMOTE WILDFIRE MITIGATION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SOME OF OUR VIEWS ON THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED WILDFIRE REGULATION. FIRST OFF IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION WE VIEW ADVOCACY AS ONE OF OUR GREATEST TOOLS. TO HELP EDUCATE ON THE CHALLENGES INSURERS AND CONSUMER SPACE I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT FOR JUST ONE SECOND- WE'RE GONNA PAUSE FOR JUST ONE SECOND TO GET THE COMPUTER BACK ON TRACK. CHUCK WAS REMISS COLLINS WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE READY. OKAY. WE ARE SO SORRY FOR THAT INTERRUPTION WE ARE BACK ON TRACK YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU NOT A PROBLEM- AS MENTIONED AS A TRADE ASSOCIATION WE DO ADVOCACY AS ONE OF OUR GREATEST TOOLS TO HELP EDUCATE ON THE CHALLENGES INSURERS AND CONSUMER SPACE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO OFFER SOLUTIONS TO PROMOTE A MORE HEALTHY AND STABLE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. OUR ORGANIZATION IS BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THE WILD HEART IN CALIFORNIA OTHER WESTERN STATES AS WELL AS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS WHICH IS THE NATIONAL GOVERNING BODY OF INSURANCE REGULATORS WE WORK TO EDUCATE ON THE INCREASING THREATS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT ARE WESTERN STATES ARE FACING IN ADDITION INCREASING FUEL LOADS IN THE GROWTH OF NEW COMMUNITIES IN THE WEEK AS THESE COLLECTIVELY LEAD TO INCREASED EXPOSURE FOR INSURERS WHICH IN TURN CAN LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. OUR INDUSTRY'S BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON WAYS TO REDUCE RISK THIS INCLUDES MAKING COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT THROUGH STRONGER AND BETTER ENFORCE BUILDING CODES INCREASED OUR IMPROVE RATHER LAND USE PLANNING RESILIENCE INFRASTRUCTURE RETROFITTING EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OF COURSE FUEL REDUCTION IN THE AREAS MOST AT RISK FOR WILDFIRES FOR INSURERS RESEARCH HAS BEEN ANOTHER IMPORTANT TOOL THROUGH THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR BUILDING AND HOME SAFETY THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MITIGATE AGAINST WILDFIRE RISK TO REDUCE FUTURE LOSSES. I'D BE JUST HAS BEEN A LEADER IN DEVELOPING SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN STANDARDS THAT ENABLE HOMES AND BUSINESSES TO WITHSTAND WILDFIRES THIS INCLUDES THEIR SUBURBAN WELFARE ADAPTATION ROADMAPS WHICH THEY ROLLED OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY AND MORE RECENTLY THE FORTHCOMING WILDFIRE PREPARED HOME DESIGNATION WHICH WILL BECOME AVAILABLE THIS SUMMER IN CALIFORNIA BEFORE EXPANDING TO OTHER WESTERN STATES THIS PROGRAM IDENTIFIES A SET OF REQUISITE MITIGATION ACTIONS THAT WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER WILL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. THE GIVEN PROPERTIES WILDFIRE RISK. WE FIRMLY THAT I MORE COME. ARE HARDENED. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN A MEANINGFUL DECREASING LOSSES WHICH SHOULD TRANSLATE TO MORE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE COVERAGE FOR CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH TO MITIGATE THE PHYSICAL RISK YOU MUST FIRST IDENTIFY THE RISK. NOTHING SURE IS OFTEN MIGHT LOOK TO THIRD PARTY VENDORS TO ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING AND ASSESSING RISK FOR INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES. THROUGH THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS INSURERS MAY EVALUATE FEATURES OF THE PROPERTY AND DETERMINE WHAT CAN AND SHOULD BE MITIGATED ACCORDING SURE MAY BE ABLE TO COVER THAT RISK SOME INSURERS ARE INCREASINGLY LOOKING TO VIRTUAL TOOLS SUCH AS- PHOTO BASED INSPECTIONS THAT CAN BE DONE REMOTELY THROUGH SMARTPHONES. TO HELP EXPEDITE- PROVIDE GREATER EFFICIENCIES IN THESE PROCESSES. A NUMBER OF INSURERS ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO OFFER WILDFIRE MITIGATION SERVICES AS AS PART OF THE POLICY BENEFITS. THESE SERVICES MAY BE COORDINATED THROUGH A THIRD PARTY VENDOR WHICH MIGHT GO OUT TO A PROPERTY TO HELP PHYSICALLY REDUCE THE WILDFIRE EXPOSURE WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT JUST THE THREAT IS IMMINENT. AND THAT COULD INCLUDE CLEARING BRUSH REMOVING DEBRIS OFF OR REMOVED. OFF THE ROOF TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF IGNITION TO THAT PROPERTY. NO ASIDE FROM REDUCING THE PHYSICAL RISK INSURERS ARE ALSO WORKING TO PROVIDE POLICYHOLDERS TOOLS TO HELP MITIGATE AGAINST FINANCIAL RISKS. IN OTHER STATES SOME OF THESE TOOLS INSURANCE ENCOURAGE INCLUDE HIGHER CATASTROPHE SPECIFIC DEDUCTIBLES WHICH CAN LEAD. TO LOWER PREMIUMS. AND ALSO WORK FOR DISASTER SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THESE UNFORTUNATE ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AT THIS TIME THEY WERE. TOLD THAT WE ARE ADVOCATING. TO PROVIDE. WE HAVE HOWEVER BEGUN TO SEE IN CALIFORNIA SOME INSURERS INCENTIVIZE RISK REDUCTION THROUGH PREMIUM CREDITS. MORE INSURERS WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SIMILAR HOWEVER HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO DO SO AS THE FRANCE JUST ISN'T THERE YET. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE VARIOUS WILDFIRE MITIGATION ACTIONS TRANSLATE INTO DOLLARS. OUR INDUSTRY IS AGGRESSIVELY WORKING TO ACTUAL WARILY QUANTIFY THE VALUE OF WILDFIRE MITIGATION MEASURES SO INSURERS CAN OFFER PREMIUM CREDITS WITHOUT OR WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY UNINTENDED HARM. THAT DOES UNFORTUNATELY TO HIGHER RATES. FOR THE PROPOSED REGULATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT THIS WOULD BE MAKING IT MANDATORY FOR INSURERS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION SENT US THROUGH THOSE PREMIUM CREDITS. IN ADDITION TO ALLOWING INSURERS TO USE WILDFIRE CATASTROPHE MODELS. YEAH TO BE CLEAR. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SHARES THE SAME GOAL OF CDI TO REDUCE RISK THREE MEDICATION TO ENCOURAGE A MORE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE INSURANCE MARKET AND INSURERS HAVE BEEN VERY EXTENSIVELY ENGAGE WITH CD I AND THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO HELP OFFER EXPERTISE IN TO FURTHER REFINE THE DRAFT REGULATION. WOW FAR REALLY IS A VERY UNIQUE RISK FROM OTHER CATASTROPHE CATASTROPHE PERILS SUCH AS MAYBE HURRICANES OR EARTHQUAKES. AND THAT TO EFFECTIVELY AND MEANINGFULLY REDUCE RISK MITIGATION IS REQUIRED THROUGH BOTH THROUGH STRUCTURAL ADAPTATION AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT OF FUELS. AND THE LATTER OF WHICH MUST BE DONE ON A RECURRING BASIS. ALSO THIS MEDICATION MUST BE DONE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AS WE KNOW WIND DRIVEN EMBERS CAN TRAVEL FROM ONE PROPERTY AND IGNITE THE NEARBY OR ADJACENT PROPERTY. CREATING A DOMINO AFFECT OF LOSSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS AS WE'VE SADLY SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. SO THIS POSES A VERY UNIQUE CHALLENGE FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHICH IS THUS FAR FOR ALL THE OTHER PERILS THAT WE INSURE. THE INDUSTRY'S ONLY NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A STANDARD FOCUS ON HARD BEING A SINGLE HOME WITH VALIDATION THAT IS A ONE TIME EVENT. THIS WILDFIRE BREAKS THAT MOLD REGARDING WHAT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE AND HOW IT SHOULD BE VALIDATED. OUR INDUSTRY CONSISTENTLY. TO THE RESEARCH OF I. B. H. S. AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THAT IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED THE SAFER FROM WILDFIRES FRAMEWORK. NOTIFIED FROM THE GAP IN THE ACTUARIAL DATA NEEDED TO CREDIBLY SUPPORT PREMIUM CREDITS- INSURERS HAVE STILL- SUBMARINE REMAIN CONCERNS WITH THE REGULATIONS SUCH AS MS COLLINS I NEED YOU TO START WRAPPING YOUR COMMENTS UP THANK YOU. THE THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL COSTS FOR INSURERS TO OPERATIONALIZE MANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ALSO THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO RACES THERE'S NO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO INSURERS ARE VENDORS WHICH EXPENSE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP NEW AND INNOVATIVE. MODELS THERE'S A GROWING CONSENSUS WITH OUR INDUSTRY ON THE NEED FOR AND BENEFITS PROVIDED BY RISK MODELS THEY PROVIDE GREATER UNDERWRITING AND PRICING PRECISION AND LEAD TO GREATER STABILITY IN PRICING. SO WE FIND THAT THERE NEED TO BE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC INFORMATION DISCLOSURE AND ALSO PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITH THESE MODEL REVIEWS. WITH THOSE CONCERNS INSURERS ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT MOTHERS MAY HESITATE TO SHARE THE MOST INNOVATIVE AND SOPHISTICATED TOOLS IN THE STATE SO WHILE THESE TOOLS ARE ADVANCING. WE IN CALIFORNIA MAY NOT BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE FULL BENEFITS THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. SO TO RECAP THEIR NUMBER OF TOOLS INSURERS LEVERAGE TO HELP PROMOTE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE PROGRESS UNDERWAY IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU YOU HAD TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS. WITHIN THAT PROPOSE REGULATION OUR PRIMARY GOAL REMAINS TO BE IDENTIFIED SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE. TO HELP PROTECT WHAT MATTERS MOST WHICH REALLY IS KEEPING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION- WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS WELL AS THE- INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVE OB THE NEXT SECTION AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON. SPENDING SOME TIME LOOKING AT. EMERGING MITIGATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND OTHER- EVOLVING TECHNOLOGIES SO NEXT I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME. A T. LE TOP. SEAL OF ZESTY A HI. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME IS UNTIL A TOP. AND I AM TO SEE- ZESTY I. WE ARE PRIVATE COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN- OAKLAND CALIFORNIA PLEASE CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN. THE YOUR GOD THANK YOU SO MUCH BYE BYE APOLOGIZE SO WE ARE A PRIVATE COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND WE ARE BUILDING ANALYTICAL MODELS TO UNDERSTAND MODERN BETTER WEATHER PHENOMENON SUCH AS WILD FIRES. AS WE HAVE HEARD FROM MANY PRESENTERS CALIFORNIA TO DATE IS IN A CRISIS AND WHAT FIRES ARE SPREADING. JUST I'M TRYING TO ADVANCE MY SLIDES FOR SOME REASON YEAH THANK YOU. ON MY FIRST SPREADING INCREASINGLY POPULATED AREA US ANY UNPREDICTED WAYS DRIVING ECONOMIC LOSSES THAT HAVE SKYROCKETED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. I EXPERIENCED THIS MYSELF WHEN I HAD TO EVACUATE MY OWN FAMILY FROM NAPA COUNTY AND NAPA COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY. SINCE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP EVERY WIDE FIRE FROM STARTING. AND WE CAN ALWAYS KEEP HOMES FROM BURNING. HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET IS NECESSARY TO BALANCE RISK AND ENABLE PEOPLE TO PROTECT THEIR PROPERTY. UNFORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET IS NOT HEALTHY TODAY. AND IT'S NOT HEALTHY BECAUSE WE ARE USING THIRTY YEAR OLD TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND A RECENT CHANGE IN WEATHER PATTERNS. NEW LOSSES AND RISKS ARE BRINGING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO A BREAKING POINT. AND IF WE ONLY HAD A DECADES OLD TOOLS TO FIGHT THIS CRISIS WOULD PROBABLY LOSE. HOST WOULD BECOME UNINSURABLE IN MANY PLACES AROUND CALIFORNIA. MEANING THAT AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY VALUE WOULD BE AT RISK OF LOSING AFFORDABLE INSURANCE AND WITH THAT MORTGAGE FINANCING AS WELL FIRE. ORANGES MY SCREEN DOESN'T COOPERATE THE DEVASTATION ROOFTOPS FIRE IN CINEMA COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SHOWS% HOPPER ONLY INCORPORATING LIMITED REGIONAL VARIABLES SUCH AS FUEL SLOW AND ACCESS AS AN IMPORTANT INTEREST MODELS FEELS TO ACCURATELY PREDICT WHERE WILDFIRES WILL OCCUR. SO HERE I'M SHOWING YOU HIGHLIGHTED IN PURPLE AN AREA OF PREDICTED WATCHED VIRUS WHICH IS CALLED THE HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN BLUE I'M SHOWING. OR JUST A- THE POINT IS THERE IS A MAJOR DELAY WITH MY SLIDES HERE SORRY FOR TECHNICAL DETAILS BUT IN BLUE I'M SHOWING SOME OF THOSE HOMES THAT WERE DESTROYED BY WILDFIRES WERE NOT IN THE HIGH FIRE HAZARD ZONES MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND PROPERTIES BURNED TOTALING IN EXCESS OF NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES IN AREAS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT SAFE. THIS LEFT INTEREST TO PUT THEIR NORMA'S BILL UNEXPECTED LOSSES. BUT TO DATE WE HAVE NEW TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND RISK THANKS TO SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO. SATELLITE AND AERIAL IMAGERY IS AVAILABLE FOR THE WHOLE STATE IN HIGH RESOLUTION. DIG UP MY PROPERTY ATTRIBUTES LOCAL WEATHER AND BUILDING PERMITS IS MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN EVER. AND WITH THIS DATA WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD CUTTING EDGE COMPUTER MODELS THAT CAN CREATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISK. BASED ON REAL LOSSES. NOT OVERLY SIMPLISTIC ASSUMPTIONS OR SIMULATIONS. OUR MODELS ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK BECAUSE WE HAVE GATHERED PRE AND POST WHY FIRE IN THE JURY AS I MENTIONED FROM SATELLITE AND FROM LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT SO NOT FROM INSPECTIONS. AND WE HAVE GAINED LOST DATA FROM ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HISTORICAL WIDE FIRED EVENTS MOST OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE LARGEST WILDFIRE LOSS DATABASE IN THE INDUSTRY. WE COMPLEMENTED THIS LOSS DATABASE WITH DATA. WITH A REAL FIRE SCIENCE FROM INSTITUTIONS LIKE CAL FIRE AND ID CHECKS TO MAKE INFORMED PREDICTIONS OFWHAT WILL MAKE MORE WHAT WILL MAKE PROPERTIES MORE OR LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSS JUST LIKE OVERHANGING VEGETATION VEGETATION MULTIPLE DEFENSIBLE ZONES AS WE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE SPEAKERS TODAY ROOF MATERIAL NEIGHBORHOOD DENSITY SMOKE A PARTIAL USE OF SUPPRESSION AND MANY MORE. OUR MODEL CAN DETERMINE WHY FIRE RISKS. ABSENT OF THE BIAS INTRODUCED BY HUMAN ANALYSTS WERE INSPECTORS. JUST REAL FIRES REAL DAMAGE AN OBSERVABLE PROPERTY FEATURES. SO WE BUILD A MODEL TO ASSESS RISK ACROSS TWO DIMENSIONS THE FIRST ONE IS RISK OF WILDFIRE OR AS THE INDUSTRY CALLS THE FREQUENCY THAT'S ORIGINAL SCORE THE DESCRIBED THE PROBABILITY OF AN ADDRESS FALLING WITHIN THE WATCH PARKER METER. THE SECOND ONE IS RISK OF PROPERTY LOSS OR SEVERITY. THAT DESCRIBES THE EXPECTED DAMAGE- ONCE ON ADDRESS FALLS WITHIN A WIDE FIRE COMMANDER AND BY THE WAY HIS SECOND SCORE IS TAKING PROPERTY SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS INTO CONSIDERATION. SO WE PROCESS ALL THE SCORES FOR EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. IN OUR SYSTEMS DELIVERED A FULLY TRANSPARENT RESULTS IN LESS THAN ONE SECOND FOR EVERY PROPERTY. I KNOW IT WILL START UP CIRCLE STRICKEN SNYDER INTERJECT I NEED YOU TO START WRAPPING UP YOUR COMMENTS YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY MORE SECONDS THANK YOU. YEAH SO I'M VERY HIGH LEVEL AND ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIA HOMES OR LOW RISK THE REMAINING HIGH RISK PROPERTIES ARE THE ONES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT MUCH MORE CLOSED AND HERE'S WHERE I WANT TO SHOW YOU AN EXAMPLE. OPERATE IN. THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS WHERE ARE THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE FIRE HAS HAPPENED. AND THIS IS WHERE INSURERS ARE NOT. ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO DO TO WRITE AND- ADD COVERAGE. IN IF YOU ZOOM IN. FURTHER AND WE LOOK AT THE PROPERTY WE CAN SEE THAT WE CAN PRODUCE AND ANALYSES. THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY SPECIFIC NEEDED MEDICATION. WE CAN SEE THAT THIS PROPERTY HAS AMAZING DEFENSIBLE SPACE HAS MODERN CODE COMPLIANT BUILDING MATERIALS. AND IS SEATED ON FLAT LAND SO EVEN THOUGH THE PROPERTY EXISTS IN THE ZONE THAT IS HIGH. FOUR FOOT WIDE VIRUS OUR MODEL CAN PREDICT ARMADA CAN TRANSPARENTLY LIST ALL THE REASONS WHY THIS SHOW WHAT IS HOME SHOULD BE INSURABLE. I LET ME JUST JUMP TO THE FINAL COMING HERE WHY SOME INSURERS ARE LEAVING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE NEW RISK OF WILDFIRE. OTHERS ARE PARTNERING WITH STI TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS FARMERS INSURANCE IS COMMITTED TO WRITING ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE NOT HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IN MY OPENING STATEMENT WE'RE AN INSURANCE CRISIS. IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TARGET OUR WRIST REDUCTION EFFORTS TO HIGH RISK REGIONS. THIS REQUIRES USING NEW TOOLS FOR ANALYSIS AND RECOGNIZING EFFECTIVE ACTIONS THAT HOME AND BUSINESS OWNERS CAN TAKE ON THEIR OWN. OUR STATE LEADERS SHOULD DO ALL THEY CAN TO ENCOURAGE PROMOTE AND HELP. ALSO FUN MITIGATION ACTIONS. NOT OUR HAND INSURANCE SHOULD DO THEIR PART BY USING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT RECOGNIZES PROPERTY DETAILS KNOWN TO REDUCE RISK OF LOSS. AND INCORPORATE THIS LEAK DETAILS IN THE UNDERWRITING AND RATING PLANS. THAT TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU MR TOP TOP AND NOW. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THAT INCREDIBLE PRESENTATION- YOU KNOW THE VISUALS ARE VERY COMPELLING- WE WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO OUR NEXT GUEST JACK MCCALL FOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF LINDSAY. FIRE SENSE AND WE ARE. RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO I'M GOING TO ASK THE PRESENTERS TO KEEP A VERY CONCISE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN- MISTER MCCALL WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR REVIEW MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND COMMITTEE STAFF I APPRECIATE IN WRITING HERE TODAY TO TALK MY NAME IS JACK ARE CALLED MUSIC IN A VICE PRESIDENT WHEN THE FIRE SOUNDS. OUR COMPANIES BASED IN AS YOU SAW A PART OF BUT NOT IN CHURCH DISTRICT. I'D LIKE TO OPEN BY SAYING THAT THE FIREBIRD TECHNOLOGY MINUTES TALK ABOUT HERE WITH THE SAME BATTING CREDIBLE GROUP ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS THE EXPERIENCE OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY. DEPLOYMENT VIA T. DEVICES AND WELFARE DETECTION AND A VERY EXCITING PROJECT LIKE I. I GO BY THE END OF THIS YOU'LL YOU'LL FREE. SO- WHY DO WE- THIS- THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY- WHILE WORKING AT THE WORST FIRES IN WORST WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA WE LOOK TO CAL FIRE MAINTAINS LISTS OF THE LARGEST MOST DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLIEST WILDFIRES IN THE STATE YOU CAN SEE THE ALMOST 25% OF THESE WILDFIRES WERE CAUSED BY POWER LINES. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT WILDFIRES TURN POWER LINES TEND TO BECOME ABOUT TEN TIMES LARGER WHEN WILDFIRES STARTED BY OTHER PRODUCTS THIS IS LARGELY BECAUSE THE TYPE OF WINDOW ON JUST THE CAUSE POWER LINE FALLS WERE ALSO EXTREMELY. EFFECTIVE SPREADING A MISSILE FIRE. THIS UNIQUE SITUATION CALLS FOR DEFENSIVE FIRE DETECTION WHICH CAN DETECT A WILDFIRE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER IGNITION. NO MATTER WHAT TIME OF DAY. SUCH RAPID DETECTION CAN REDUCE THE RESPONSE TIME ENSURING THAT FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES PROVIDED THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE FIRE SO HOW IS THIS DONE TODAY. THERE ARE SEVERAL EXISTING WILDFIRE DETECTION SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD HOWEVER MOST OF THESE ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO LOOK OVER EXPANSIVE AREAS AND STOP WILDFIRES FROM A DISTANCE MOST COMMONLY BY IDENTIFYING SMOKE. WHICH MAY LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR RAPID DETECTION QUALIFIERS SMALL. IN COMPARISON THE FIREBIRDS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE PLACED ALONG HIGH RISK BOUNDARIES AND THEN TO DETECT AND REPORT A VERY SMALL WILDFIRES WHICH HER IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THAT SOUND. AS NOTED UTILITY POWER LINES ARE A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT HIGH RISK I DON'T REDUCE THEIR RECRUITMENT SOURCE OFTEN SEVERE WILDFIRES. WITH THE FARMER SYSTEM HAS TWO PRIMARY FUNCTIONS FIRST THE TECH WORLD FIGHTERS. SENSORS WITHIN EACH- FIREBIRD UNIT CAN DETECT WILDFIRES ACROSS AN ALMOST THOUSAND FOOT RADIUS RESULTING IN ABOUT A SIXTY A PROTECTION ZONE. AND WILDFIRES AS SMALL AS FIVE BY FIVE FEET IN THE DETECTED AS FAR OUT AS TWO HUNDRED FEET AND EVEN SMALLER FIRES CAN BE DETECTED ON CLOSER TO ART. THE SECOND FUNCTION OF THE FIREBIRD IS TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE IS A FIRE. ONCE DETECTED THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO NOTIFY INTERESTED PARTIES BY TEXT OR EMAIL TYPICALLY WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF DETECTION- REPLACED AT REGULAR INTERVALS THE FIBER DEVICES CAN PROVIDE CONTINUOUS WELFARE DETECTION ONE SO WITH THE RIGHTS OF WAY. THEY CAN ALSO BE PLACED ON ANOTHER CRITICAL BOUNDARY AREAS JUST ROADWAYS ON. OUR WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. EACH FIRE PER DEVICE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND SURROUNDING AREA USING SIX WILDFIRES SPECIFIC FORMAL DETECTORS AND OPTICAL CAMPUS. USE MULTIPLE UNCONVENTIONAL NETWORK ALGORITHMS PROCESS IN EACH UNIT TO MINIMIZE FALSE FOR MISFIRE DETECTION. THE SYSTEM ALSO OPERATES THE TIMES NO PERSONNEL ARE REQUIRED OPERATE FROM ONE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. WHEN A SUSPECTED WILDFIRES DETECTED- EXCUSE ME- OF THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFIES DESIGNATED PERSONNEL LIKE TEXT AND EMAIL INCLUDING IMAGES OF THE SUSPECT THE FIRE. ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR DEDICATED CONTROL CENTERS AND PERSONNEL REDUCES THE COST AND INCREASES THE SPEED OF IMPLEMENTATION. ADDITIONALLY THE FIBER DEVICES ARE SOLAR POWERED AND CONTAINS NO MEDICATION FURTHER REDUCING THE TIME AND COSTS ASSOCIATED. FIREBIRDS OF MULTIPLE CAMERAS CAN ALSO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION THE OVERLAPPING IMAGES CAMERAS PROVIDE A 310060 DEGREES VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING AREA POTENTIALLY PROVIDING IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE CAUSE OF THE YOUTH THAT. AS AN ADDED BENEFIT FOR UTILITIES FIBER DEVICES ALSO REGULARLY PHOTOGRAPHED A POWER LINE MORE CONDITIONS THE SYSTEM INVENTOR BY AUTOMATIC BEFOREHAND AFTER COMPARISONS TO HELP UTILITIES DETERMINING DAMAGE OCCURRED TO THE WIND POWER WITHOUT. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS VERY USEFUL WHEN DECIDING WHEN IT'S POSSIBLE TO SAFELY REENERGIZE A LINE AFTER PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. TO HELP BETTER DEMONSTRATES HOW THE FIREBIRD BENEFIT THE STATE IN TERMS OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE REAL WILDFIRE AND HOW IT'S TIME LINE MAY HAVE BEEN ALTERED AND FOR YOUR ROOT SYSTEM AND THE OVAL. AND DEPLOYED AT THAT TIME. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH A COPY OF THIS PRESENTATION WHICH INCLUDES MORE DETAILED TIMELINE IT'S COVERED UP HERE BUT THIS RED BOX. ON THE ROOF THE TEXT IN THE RED BOX IS SIMPLIFIED AND LARGE FOR EASIER VIEWING DURING. SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THIS WILDFIRE WAS THE SIMPLE POWER OUTAGES REPORTED. THREE AND A HALF HOURS LATER. A UTILITY WORKER ARRIVED AT THE SITE REPORTED OUTAGE AND DISCOVERED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS SOME DISTANCE AWAY. DIFFICULT ROAD CONDITIONS RESULTED IN THE TAKING AN ADDITIONAL SIX HOURS FOR THE WORKERS TO GET AT THE SITE THE ACTUAL COSTS ON ARRIVING THERE THE WORKER DISCOVERED. A TREE LEANING AGAINST THE STILL PARTIALLY ENERGIZED POWER LINE. AND THE SMALL FIRE AT THE BASE OF THE TREE. THERE WAS SOME COMMUNICATION ISSUES CALIFORNIA WAS NOT NOTIFIED FORTY FIVE MINUTES HOWEVER THE- MORE RESPONSE FROM CAL FIRE'S QUICK WITH WATER AND FIRE RETARDANT DROPS STARTING ON FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER. NOW THIS IS OVER TEN HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL REPORT. HOW MUCH. UNFORTUNATELY A DRONE APPEARS ON THE SITE OF GROUND AND AIR SUPPORT. FOR THE TRUNK I AM DRAWN TO PARTS IT'S DARK INTERESTED PARTIES BROWNING TOLD THE NEXT DAY. AT THE END OF THE NEXT DAY THE FARMS TWO THOUSAND ACRES AND BY THE END OF THE WEEK. ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES SITES. THE DIFFERENT FEATURES OF THE FIREBRAND OF ALL THROUGH THIS TIMELINE TWO WAYS FIRST SCENARIO BY EARLY DETECTION THE PHONE TREE. RECALL THE FIREBIRDS SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE IMAGES OF THE POWER LINE. IF THE SYSTEM WERE IN PLACE THE CHILI COULD HAVE REQUESTED A SET OF IMAGES OF OUR LINE EITHER AT THE TIME OUR RELIGIONS INITIALLY REPORTED THAT. WORK WHEN UTILITY WORKER FIRST ARRIVED REALIZED THE CAUSE OF THE OUTAGE FOR THE WAY. IT EXAMINATION OF THE IMAGE SHOWED THE TREE LEANING INTO THE WIND THE POWER LINE COULD HAVE BEEN PREEMPTIVELY. BE ENERGIZED LIKELY PREVENTING. THE SECOND AND MORE EXPECTED NOTHING FROM THE SYSTEM ALTERING THE TIMELINE WOULD HAVE BEEN THROUGH YOUR DETECTION FIRE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX NATURE OF THE ACTUAL FIRES TIMELINE HERE WE ARE ONLY GOING TO ASSUME THAT THE FIREBIRDS SYSTEM COULD HAVE PROVIDED HELLFIRE WITH. NOTIFICATION ONE HOUR PRIOR TO WHEN THE- ASSUMING ALL OF THE OTHER EVENTS IN THE TIMELINE IN SEQUENCE G. DIFFERENCE NOW IS THAT WHEN THE DRONE DEPARTS THERE IS STILL ONE OF OUR DAILY AFTER THE ACTUAL FIRE WE BELIEVE MERCHANTS IN RESPOND RISK ACTIVELY CONTROL THE FIRE ONE TO TWO ACRES WITH THE ADDITIONAL TIME THEY WERE ROBBED OF DUE TO THE DRONE NOT ALLOWING RESUMPTION- SUPPORT. ALL HERE WE SEE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE FIREBIRDS SYSTEM PROVED TO BE PROVIDED AT LEAST TWO OPPORTUNITIES TO EITHER HAVE PREVENTED THE FIRE FROM STARTING. OR TO CONTROL THE FIRE BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL TIME ROUTINES. IN SUMMARY THE FIREBIRD WILDFIRE DETECTION SYSTEM OVER HE PROBABILITIES DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF DETECTING WILDFIRES WHICH OCCUR ALONG POWER LINES. ALL DEPLOYMENT OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD. REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SMALL WILDFIRES FROM GOING UNNOTICED REDUCE THE FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES NEEDED TO CONTROL THE SMALLER AMOUNT. REDUCED PROPERTY DAMAGE REDUCE THE LOSS OF LIFE INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY AND IF NEED AND IF NECESSARY INCREASED TIME FOR YOU WHICH I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY MISTER MCCALL- EVERY SHAPE THE TIME SPENT HERE NEXT WE WILL MOVE ON TO. OUR NEXT PRESENTER RANDY WILDFIRE DEFENSE SYSTEMS MR CLARK THING READY YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE GERMAN RUBIO ASSISTANT- SHARED JONES. I AM GOING.

HAT'S IMPORTANT PAPERS PHOTOS WHATEVER THEY DECIDE IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ARE LEFT BEHIND. AND THESE ARE ANXIOUS AND FRIGHTENING TIMES BUT IF THE HOME IS INSURED BY A COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH WTS. WE'VE ALREADY BEEN TRACKING THAT FAR DOING THREAT ASSESSMENTS IN PRE POSITIONING RESOURCES TO TAKE MITIGATION STEPS TO PROTECT THE HOME.

INCLUDING TENDERS AND TRUCKS AS WELL AS HAND CREWS. THIS IS OUR MISSION- WE TEACH OUR PEOPLE DO THINK LIKE EMBERS AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT STARTS MOST FIRED WE SHOP AHEAD OF AND AFTER THE- THE FOURTH AT THE FRONT OF THE FIRE TAKING STEPS AS SOME AS SIMPLE AS- BLOWING OUT GUTTERS AND REMOVING DECK FURNITURE ALL THE WAY UP TO SETTING UP SPRINKLER SYSTEMS IMPLYING RETARDANT OR FIRE BLOCKING GEL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I MAKE A POINT ABOUT FIRE RETARDANT BLOCKING GEL WE USE NO P. FOSTER OTHER CHEMICALS THAT CAN CAUSE. RISK OF HARM TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PEOPLE OR ANY PEOPLE OR TO THE ENVIRONMENT. OUR PRODUCTS MEET OR EXCEED STANDARDS NECESSARY TO BE LISTED ON THE QUALIFIED PRODUCTS LIST OF THE UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE. YOU CAN SEE HERE. WE ARE BASED IN BOZEMAN WE'RE IN COLORADO OREGON IDAHO- WITH A STRONG PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE EMPLOYED DOZENS OF PEOPLE ASSIGNING CALIFORNIAN PAY LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TAX ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A PICTURE OF A PORTION OF OUR EMERGENCY COORDINATION CENTER- FROM THIS ROOM WE TRACK EVERY FIRE OF SIGNIFICANCE IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES TRYING ON FEDERAL AND STATE RESOURCES RESOURCES BUT ALSO OUR OWN FIRE SPECIALS. THIS ALLOWS US TO MOVE TRUCKS AND PERSONNEL ALL OF OUR VEHICLES HAVE GPS TRACKING IN OUR LIVE ON THE SYSTEM KNOWN AS SCOUT. BY INCIDENT COMMAND ON CALIFORNIA FIRES. I WANT TO MOVE QUICKLY TO- THE RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MATTERS DID YOU CAN SEE HERE WE'VE GOT- OOPS I WENT TOO FAR WE NEED TO GO BACK. THERE WE GO- LAST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN CALIFORNIA WE SET FOOT ON IN AND TOOK MITIGATION STEPS ON JUST SHORT OF SEVEN THOUSAND HOMES. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE WORK WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE WE WILL BE SCALED UP TO AND BE ABLE TO SET FOOT ON. TWO THOUSAND HOMES A WEEK SO IN A LINK THE FIRE SEASON. PERHAPS AS MANY AS TWENTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOMES- WE PHYSICALLY SET FOOT ON BECAUSE THAT'S THE REAL KEY. WILL STAFF OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND HOURS WORKED BY W. D. S- YOU. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO CLEARLY DEALING WITH CAT WITH WILDFIRE IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM- THE RIPPLE EFFECTS ON INSURANCE INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY- IS A MULTI FACETED PROBLEM. ALL OF OUR INSURANCE RESOURCES LIKE W. E. S. ARE NOT THE ONLY ANSWER OF COURSE BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO SAVING CALIFORNIA PROPERTY. OF ONE HOUSE AT A TIME THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR **** WROTE FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WE HAVE- ONE MORE WHICH WILL BE COMBINED AS ONE REMIND THE NEXT PRESENTERS YOU'LL HAVE. COMBINED TIME OF US SEVEN MINUTES SO- I WILL START WITH KATIE SOBEL MANAGING DIRECTOR. A. ON PUBLIC SECTOR SECTOR PARTNERSHIP. WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. AFTER MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND THANK YOU TO OUR FELLOW PRESENTERS WE WILL KEEP OUR COMMENT SHORT. MY NAME IS KATIE STABLE AND OUR STATE AND LOCAL PRACTICE GROUP FOR ENHANCED PUBLIC SECTOR PARTNERSHIP AND JOINING ME IS MY CALLING MITCHELL ROSENBERG. MANAGING DIRECTOR FOR ANZ SECURITIES. PER FORTY YEARS AND HAS SUPPORTED RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES INCLUDING MORE THAN HALF THE US STATES OVER A HUNDRED LARGE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS AND DOZENS OF LARGE. THE LARGEST TRANSPORTATION PUBLIC UTILITY AUTHORITIES. IN A FEW MINUTES WE HAVE TODAY MENTIONED I WILL BRIEFLY DISCUSS PARAMETRIC PRODUCTS AND HIGHLIGHT HOW THEY'RE BEING USED ESPECIALLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR WILDFIRES. BY THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. WHEN YOU MANAGE COVERAGE THERE ARE TWO MAIN WAYS TO STRUCTURE HOW INSURANCE RECOVERIES ARE RECEIVED BY A POLICYHOLDER. THE FIRST AND MOST WIDELY KNOWN AREN'T THAT MANY PRODUCTS. WHICH PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE WHEN AN ACTUAL DOLLAR LOSS OCCURS OFTEN DUE TO PHYSICAL DAMAGE. THIS IS TYPICALLY HOW IN A HOMEOWNERS OR CAR INSURANCE POLICIES DRAFTED WHERE IF AN EVENT OCCURS A CLAIM IS FILED. INSURE CONFIRMS THAT THE DEDUCTIBLE IS MET OUR CLAIMS ADJUDICATION PROCESS IS COMPLETED AND THEN THE INSURED RECEIVED. THE SECOND IS PARAMETRIC BASED OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT REQUIRE DEDUCTIBLE AND RECOVERIES ARE NOT I DO NOT HAVE TO BE KIND OF PHYSICAL DAMAGE FOR AN ACTUAL DOLLAR LOSS INSTEAD A PRESET AMOUNT OF INSURANCE IS PAID OUT WHEN A PRE AGREED THAT THAT OCCURS. THE SECOND YEAR A WILDFIRE BURNING A CERTAIN NUMBER OF ACRES RAINFALL OR STORM SURGE OR OVER A CERTAIN LEVEL AS IS THE CASE WITH THE NEW YORK METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. MR BAROMETRIC PRESSURE OF A HURRICANE AS IS THE CASE FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF JAMAICA OR AN EARTHQUAKE OF A CERTAIN MAGNITUDE AS IS THE. ASE FOR BLACKSTONE CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE TWO CLEAR BY OF PARAMETRIC INSURANCE THE FIRST IS HOW QUICKLY THE INSURANCE RECOVERIES ARE PAID OUT. OFTEN IN DAYS OR WEEKS COMPARED TO ADANI PRODUCTS. AND THE SECOND IS THAT PARAMETRIC COVERAGE IS OFTEN USED TO FILL INSURED. UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED PROTECTION GAPS ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ACCOMPANY PRODUCTS NOT SUCH AS RECOVERIES FOR FINANCIAL OR BUDGETARY LOSSES. WHEN THERE'S NO ACTUAL PHYSICAL DAMAGE SUCH AS A BUSINESS OR SERVICE INTERRUPTION. ALTHOUGH THE OUTSIDE OF THE PARAMETRIC PRODUCT IS BROADER COVERAGE AND MORE ©EDIACY POTENTIAL CONCERN IS STRUCTURING A SOLUTION TO AVOID WHAT THEY CALL AN INVEST ACTORS. WHERE THE INSURED EXPERIENCES A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT DOES NOT MEET THE PRE AGREED PARAMETERS COVERAGE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WORKING WITH A QUALIFIED PARTNER WHO HAS EXPERIENCE NOT ONLY STRUCTURAL PARAMETRIC PRODUCTS. BUT WHO ALSO HAS ACCESS TO MULTIPLE MARKETS IT'S CRITICAL TO REDUCE US MESS ACTORS. GREAT COMPETITION AND PRICING AND DRIVE TRANSPARENCY. WHEN USED CORRECTLY PARAMETRIC COVERAGE IS USED TO COMPLEMENT NOT REPLACE SELF INSURANCE INTERNET COVERAGE AND REALLY IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS JUST ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. WELL THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT EXAMPLES TO SHARE INCLUDING THE WORLD BANK NEW YORK METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND THE GOVERNMENT JAMAICA. WE THOUGHT IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO HIGHLIGHT THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF POWER AND WATER. WHICH CURRENTLY COVERED BY A PARAMETRIC PRODUCT FOR WILDFIRE. LAST YEAR AND CREATED THE FIRST WILDFIRE PARAMETRIC CASH CASH BOND. WITH FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF INSURANCE PROTECTION FOR LA DEPARTMENT OF. WATER AND POWER. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO USE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE. THEIR DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO CLOSE THAT. GAP I CAN'T COMPROMISE L. A. D. W. P. WITH COVERAGE ON A PARAMETRIC BASED S. TIED TO A WILDFIRE BURNING IN A SPECIFIC LOCATION. THIS WAS THE FIRST CAP ON GLOBALLY TO BENEFIT A MENISCAL UTILITY ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. PRODUCT WAS AWARDED BOTH THE TRADING REST NOW MIGHT TRANSACTION OF THE YEAR AND THE INSURANCE INSIDER'S REINSURANCE TRANSACTION OF THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN CLOSING WITH A FOUR TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ON HOW BEST TO THINK ABOUT- METRIC PRODUCTS TO COMBAT INSURED. UNDER INSURED AND UNINSURED ACTION ACTION GAPS TO PROTECT PROTECT AGAINST KNOWN AND UNKNOWN EMERGING RESEARCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL DISASTERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH KATIE ARE NOW TURN IT OVER TO MR ROSENBERG YOU MAY PROCEED. MANAGER WE'RE TOGETHER SO THAT WAS OUR PRESS OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE HOW CONCISE YOU WERE I WANT TO NOW TURN IT OVER TO MEMBERS AND THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. MISTER ROGER LADA YOU MAY PROCEED. SOMEONE GET HIS MICROPHONE PLEASE TESTING TESTING THERE IS OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- FOR GREAT.
