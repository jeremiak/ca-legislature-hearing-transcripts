00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:36.479
RIGHTS AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.547
SECURE THEM.

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:38.982
WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO TALK ABOUT

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:41.618
THE FAMOUS PEOPLE WE TALK ABOUT

00:58:41.684 --> 00:58:43.453
AUDRE LORDE AND JAMES BALDWIN

00:58:43.519 --> 00:58:45.788
AND BAYARD RUSTIN AND BARBARA

00:58:45.855 --> 00:58:46.956
SMITH AND PHIL WILSON.

00:58:47.023 --> 00:58:48.591
ALL OF THOS IN THE FOREFRONT OF

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:49.692
THE STRUGGLE.

00:58:49.759 --> 00:58:50.927
BUT SOMETIMES WE FORGET THOSE

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:52.795
WERE NOT THE ACTIVISTS IN TERMS

00:58:52.862 --> 00:58:54.163
OF THE FOREFRONT BUT THOSE WHO

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.466
JUST EVERY DAY LGBT PEOPLE

00:58:56.532 --> 00:58:58.167
TRYING TO LIVE THEIR LIVES.

00:58:58.234 --> 00:59:00.336
TRYING TO BASICALLY BE HAPPY IN

00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:01.537
WHO THEY ARE.

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.772
I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF L. G. B. T.

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.707
MEMBERS WHO WERE MY STUDENTS AND

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.142
MY COLLEAGUES.

00:59:06.209 --> 00:59:07.610
AND WATCH THEM STRUGGLED NOT

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:10.280
ONLY ON BEING JUST L. G. B. T..

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:11.447
BUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:12.916
THEY FIT IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.517
IN THE BLACK CHURCHES IN THE

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:16.819
BLACK SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONS.

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:17.921
AND OFTENTIMES THEY SUFFER A

00:59:17.987 --> 00:59:19.656
DOUBLE IF NOT A TRIPLE WHAMMY

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:21.457
EVERY NOW AND THEN IF THEY'RE

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.293
FEMALE IF THEY'RE BLACK AND

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:24.627
THEIR L. G. B. T..

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:26.262
IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:28.197
YOURSELF AND TO BE A PART OF A

00:59:28.264 --> 00:59:29.032
COMMUNITY.

00:59:29.098 --> 00:59:30.733
I'VE SEEN SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.568
WHO ARE REALLY TORN BECAUSE THEY

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:34.170
CAN'T COME OUT OR THEY DON'T

00:59:34.237 --> 00:59:35.138
FEEL THEY CAN OR IF THEY DO COME

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:36.005
OUT.

00:59:36.072 --> 00:59:37.006
THEY FEEL THEY WILL LOSE THE

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.875
LOVE AND RESPECT.

00:59:38.942 --> 00:59:40.610
OF THE FOLKS WHO CARE ABOUT THEM.

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:41.311
ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:42.779
EXPERIENCES I HAD WAS WHEN I

00:59:42.845 --> 00:59:45.381
LOST ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES A VERY

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.849
GOOD FRIEND DR DANI SCARBOROUGH.

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.518
WAS A DANCER AT SAN DIEGO STATE

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:49.419
ONE OF MY FACULTY ONE OF MY

00:59:49.485 --> 00:59:50.687
COLLEAGUES SOMEONE THAT I LOVE

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.455
DEARLY THAT MY CHILDREN

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:54.057
CONSIDERED THE GODFATHER.

00:59:54.123 --> 00:59:55.325
AND THEY LOVED HIM DEARLY AND HE

00:59:55.391 --> 00:59:56.893
WAS A HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.261
VICTIMS OF AIDS.

00:59:58.328 --> 00:59:59.996
IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE EVEN

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.798
DESPITE ALL OF THE CARE THAT WE

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:02.932
HAVE FOR HIM.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:04.534
HE WAS SO AFRAID THAT SOMEONE

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.169
WOULD KNOW THAT HE WAS GAY.

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.770
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING

01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:09.739
BECAUSE WE ALL KNEW HE WAS GAY.

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:10.540
AND IT WAS KIND OF A LARRY IS

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:11.874
WHEN HE CAME OUT AND SAID YOU

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:13.776
KNOW I HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:14.744
LIFESTYLE.

01:00:14.811 --> 01:00:16.179
AND I SAID YOU MEAN YOU STRAIGHT

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.982
OUT WE WAS JUST SHOCKED BECAUSE

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.550
WE ALL KNEW HE WAS GAY.

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.485
BUT THE FEAR THAT HE WOULD THAT

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.820
WE WOULD REJECT HIM.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:25.755
EVEN AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME WAS

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.824
UNEMPLOYED JUST AMAZING TO ALL

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.026
OF US ALL OF HIS STUDENTS IN THE

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.527
COLLEAGUES IN WHO LOVED HIM SO

01:00:31.594 --> 01:00:32.562
DEARLY.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:33.563
AND THE FEAR THAT WE WOULD

01:00:33.629 --> 01:00:35.531
REJECT HIM IF WE KNEW HE WAS GAY

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:37.066
AND YET EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.634
SAYS I'M TRULY GAY I AM

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.336
WONDERFUL AND EVERYONE LOVED

01:00:40.403 --> 01:00:41.104
IMPORT.

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:43.573
SO I OFTEN THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:00:43.639 --> 01:00:45.108
WE MISS AS A COMMUNITY.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.743
BECAUSE WE OFTENTIMES DON'T LET

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:49.712
PEOPLE BASICALLY RELAX AND TO BE

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.247
THEMSELVES AND BE ACCEPTED.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.515
AN ETHNIC COMMUNITIES HAVE

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:54.450
DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH THE LGBT

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:56.619
COMMUNITY WOULD WE DON'T WE

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.554
DON'T WE US ALMOST AS IFTO SAY.

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.556
I WON'T ASK AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.692
TO TELL AND WE'LL ALL BE OKAY.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:04.227
AND YET WE ALL AREN'T OKAY.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.728
SO IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.996
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS THAT THE

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.098
THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SUFFER

01:01:09.165 --> 01:01:09.999
SO SEVERELY.

01:01:10.066 --> 01:01:11.467
IT WOULD HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:01:11.534 --> 01:01:13.069
PARTICULAR POPULATION BECAUSE

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:15.038
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T FIT IN WITH --

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:16.906
THE WHAT THE LGBT COMMUNITY

01:01:16.973 --> 01:01:18.875
THAT'S PREDOMINANTLY WHITE THEY

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.143
DON'T FIT AND CULTURALLY THAT'LL

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:22.011
FIT IN IN MANY WAYS AND SO

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.279
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND THEIR

01:01:23.346 --> 01:01:24.180
OWN IDENTITY.

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:26.416
AND SOMETIMES OWN COMMUNITY

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:27.950
DEMANDS THAT THEY NOT BE FULL

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.419
EXPRESSIVE OF WHO THEY ARE.

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.087
IT IS INTERESTING TO ME THAT THE

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.722
BLACK LG P. L. G. B. T.

01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:34.390
COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO SUFFER.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:35.658
THE SEVEREST FORMS OF

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:37.693
DISCRIMINATION IN TERMS OF IT

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:42.832
YOU JUST HEARD THE ONLY SEVEN

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:44.333
INDIVIDUALS KILL THIS YEAR WHO

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.968
TRANS GENDER ALL BLACK WOMEN.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:47.603
UNBELIEVABLE THAT THAT EXIST AND

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:48.571
YET IT IS NOT THE FANFARE AND IS

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.172
NOT WHAT WE HEAR ABOUT PROBLEM

01:01:49.238 --> 01:01:50.840
BECAUSE THEY FALL INTO THE

01:01:50.907 --> 01:01:52.308
CATEGORY OF THINGS THAT DON'T

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.576
UPSET US A LOT.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.844
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:55.845
ARE STILL SUFFERING WITH WITH

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:57.413
AIDS AND NOT GETTING THE CARE

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.581
THAT THEY NEED?

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.849
IT IS THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.184
COMMUNITY I REMEMBER VERY

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.285
CLEARLY WHEN ONE OF THE

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.353
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES A FEW

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.555
YEARS AGO WAS ASK ABOUT.

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:07.557
BUT AIDS IN BLACK COMMUNITIES HE

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.158
BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT AFRICA AND

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.493
SOMEONE SAYS NO NO NO I'M

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.862
TALKING ABOUT WASHINGTON DC I'M

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:14.297
TALKING ABOUT NEW YORK I'M

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:16.199
TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES.

01:02:16.265 --> 01:02:17.233
AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.302
HIGH NUMBERS OF ALL OF THE NEW

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.170
INCIDENTS ARE BASICALLY IN BLACK

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.005
AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.174
LONG WAY TO GO TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.943
THESE ISSUES ARE ISSUES FOR ALL

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:27.810

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.412

COMMUNITY WOULD BE AT ODDS WITH

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.764
THAT OF EVANGELICAL CHRISTIAN

WORK AND RECOGNIZING THAT ALL

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.004

A KALEIDOSCOPIC REPRESENTATION.

01:23:10.752 --> 01:23:12.253
OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.091
IN SIZES IN AGES AND RACES AND

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:21.830
ETHNICITIES.

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.098

LOVE [inaudible]

01:23:26.434 --> 01:23:28.737

RESILIENCE AND DETERMINATION.

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:33.908
IN THEIR EYES.

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:35.176
YOU KNOW LAST YEAR ONE OF THE

01:23:35.243 --> 01:23:37.612
VERY FIRST VOTE THAT I TOOK ON

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.315
THIS FLOOR WAS ON CONVERSION

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.416
THERAPY.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:44.052
AND I HADN'T BEEN HERE THAT LONG.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.755
AND I WAS ACTUALLY AGHAST THAT

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:47.989
THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:49.524
STILL TALKING ABOUT.

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:52.093
AND I REMEMBER SHARING THIS AT

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.095
BATH SHYING A LOCAL SYNAGOGUE IN

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.597
MY COMMUNITY IT IS THE FIRST

01:23:55.663 --> 01:23:58.600
LGBT -- Q. SYNAGOGUE FOUNDED IN

01:23:58.666 --> 01:23:59.768
THE WORLD.

01:23:59.834 --> 01:24:01.770
I SHARED THIS WITH OUR MEMBERS

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:03.738
IN ATTENDANCE.

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.206
AND WAS RETURNED.

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:08.676
WITH SADNESS AND GAS THAT THIS

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.211
IN FACT WAS SOMETHING.

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.847
THAT WE WERE STILL TALKING ABOUT.

01:24:12.914 --> 01:24:15.383
AS WE CONTINUE TO GRAPPLE WITH

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.619
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE WE KNOW

01:24:17.685 --> 01:24:19.387
THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCHIS NOW

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:21.689
STARTING TO OPERATE MORE AND

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:23.191
MORE HOSPITALS.

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:26.027
THAT IS GREAT BECAUSE THAT IS

01:24:26.094 --> 01:24:27.429
TALKING ABOUT HAVING GREATER

01:24:27.495 --> 01:24:29.164
ACCESS TO CARE.

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:31.666
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WHICH

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:39.073
OPERATING THOSE HOSPITALS.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:39.641
THEY WILL BE SHARING A VERY

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:40.675
PRESCRIPTIVE VALUE SYSTEM.

01:24:40.742 --> 01:24:41.776
THAT HAS BEEN RESTRICTIVE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:42.744
TOWARDS AND BIASED AGAINST WOMEN

01:24:42.811 --> 01:24:44.345
AND MEMBERS OF THE LGBT

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:46.514
COMMUNITY.

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:49.150
AS WE BEGAN TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

01:24:49.217 --> 01:24:51.352
ARE GOING TO FIND COMPASSION AND

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.154
LOVE AND EMPATHY WITH HOW WE

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.889
COMMUNICATE.

01:24:54.956 --> 01:24:56.524
WITH OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:57.759
FRIENDS.

01:24:57.826 --> 01:24:59.861
LET'S THINK ABOUT THE WORDS THAT

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:00.795
ARE IN THIS RESOLUTION

01:25:00.862 --> 01:25:01.095
[inaudible]

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.997
AND NO.

01:25:03.064 --> 01:25:05.400
THAT THE LIVES OF OUR LGBT Q.

01:25:05.467 --> 01:25:07.635
FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS ARE

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.404
IMPORTANT.

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.473
AT THE EQUAL AND EQUITABLE AND

01:25:11.539 --> 01:25:14.642
FAIR TREATMENT OF OUR LGBT Q.

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:16.344
FAMILY FRIENDS.

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.313
FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS.

01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:20.815
ARE IMPORTANT.

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.017
AND LET'S NOT JUST CELEBRATE ON

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:24.886
A DAY AND THEN GO ON ABOUT OUR

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.388
BUSINESS.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:29.791
SCHERING SHAME AND TOLERANCE AND

01:25:29.858 --> 01:25:31.860
RESENTMENT.

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:34.028
BECAUSE I'M SURE MANY OF US HAVE

01:25:34.095 --> 01:25:35.663
HAD TO FACE THE SAME KIND OF

01:25:35.730 --> 01:25:38.132
GOOD DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:39.968
AND FEELINGS THAT WE KNOW.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.002
OUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND OUR

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.403
FRIENDS IN THE LGBT COMMUNITY

01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:44.305
HAVE EXPERIENCED.

01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:46.975
I WANT TO SHARE THAT -- MY

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:49.344
COUSIN COUSIN BUZZY.

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:51.779
LONG AGO -- HE WAS A FLIGHT

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:54.048
ATTENDANT AND LIVED IN SAN

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:57.552
FRANCISCO AND HE WAS GAY.

01:25:57.619 --> 01:25:59.020
AND I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS GAY.

01:25:59.087 --> 01:26:00.655
I'M BECAUSE I WAS TOO LITTLE AND

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:01.756
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.525
BUT WHAT I DID NOTICE WAS THAT

01:26:03.591 --> 01:26:06.127
EVERY TIME HE CAME AROUND ALL OF

01:26:06.194 --> 01:26:07.462
THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY.

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:09.297
WOULD RUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

01:26:09.364 --> 01:26:11.266
HAD WHAT HE NEEDED WOULD EMBRACE

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:13.001
HIM WOULD HANG WITH HIM AND

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.536
WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HE HAD THE

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:17.071
LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDED.

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:19.807
AND WHAT I REALIZED LATER ON WAS.

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:22.143
IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS GAY.

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.879
AND HE HAD BEEN ERASED.

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:26.848
FROM OUR FAMILY TREE.

01:26:26.915 --> 01:26:28.950
BY HIS FATHER SOMEONE WHO DID

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:32.287
NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANT. TO

01:26:32.353 --> 01:26:36.024
HAVE AND LOVE BLACKS OUT.

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:37.992
BUT HE DIED YEARS LATER FROM

01:26:38.059 --> 01:26:40.295
COMPLICATIONS OF AIDS.

01:26:40.361 --> 01:26:40.862
BUT HE ALSO DIED OF A BROKEN

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:42.897
HEART.

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:44.866
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS RESOLUTION

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:48.002
AND WHAT PRIDE MONTH

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:48.303
[inaudible]

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:49.571
FIGHTS AGAINST.

01:26:49.637 --> 01:26:51.673
SO AS ASSIST WOMAN.

01:26:51.739 --> 01:26:54.108
AS AN ALLY TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:54.909
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:56.678
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK

01:26:56.744 --> 01:27:03.084

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:13.895
LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS.

01:27:13.962 --> 01:27:18.099
IN SUPPORT OF RESOLUTION AND ACR

01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:19.200
NINETY NINE AND I WANT TO THANK

01:27:19.267 --> 01:27:20.268
THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.804
FORWARD -- SPEAKING ON THIS

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:24.038
RESOLUTION.

01:27:24.105 --> 01:27:25.640
I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MANY

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:28.009
OF US BECAUSE THE VERY PRACTICE

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.611
OF CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH

01:27:29.677 --> 01:27:31.779
STILL HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.715
GOES TO THE HEART.

01:27:33.781 --> 01:27:36.417
OF THE DISCRIMINATION THAT HAS

01:27:36.484 --> 01:27:38.553
BEEN HOUNDING LGBT PEOPLE

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.422
[inaudible] FOR MILLENNIUM.

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:44.225
T. TO PERPETUATE THE IDEA BUT

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:45.193
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH

01:27:45.259 --> 01:27:47.795
THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS TO BE

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:49.364
OR CAN BE CURED.

01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:52.266
CONTINUES THE CYCLE OF SHAME.

01:27:52.333 --> 01:27:54.636
OF THE NILE.

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.671
A DISCRIMINATION AND IN MANY

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:58.172
CASES OF VIOLENCE.

01:27:58.239 --> 01:28:00.775
THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS.

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:01.709
HOW WE JUST WENT THROUGH A VERY

01:28:01.776 --> 01:28:03.911
JOYOUS CEREMONY WERE REAL WE

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.213
WERE ABLE TO HONOR PEOPLE?

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:06.347
WHO HAVE BEEN EXCEPTIONAL

01:28:06.414 --> 01:28:09.784
CONTRIBUTORS? TO OUR STATE.

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:10.585
AND THEIR CONTRIBUTORS NOT IN

01:28:10.652 --> 01:28:13.454
SPITE OF WHERE THEY FALL ON THE

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:15.089
GENDER SPECTRUM.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:18.326
BUT BECAUSE OF IT [inaudible]

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:23.331
AND TO HAVE THE IDEA THAT THAT

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:24.532
PART OF THEM SHOULD BE A RACE OR

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.534
DENIED.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.102
WHATEVER ROBBED US OF THOSE

01:28:28.169 --> 01:28:29.203
CONTRIBUTIONS THAT THOSE

01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:31.806
INDIVIDUALS MADE.

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.207
WATCHING THE CEREMONY I WAS

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:33.775
THINKING BACK TO WHEN I WAS

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.910
YOUNG.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:37.111
MY VERY BEST FRIEND GROWING UP.

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:39.747
WHEN I WAS A GIRL?

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:41.482
WAS A LESBIAN NOW.

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:42.884
NONE OF US SPOKE OF THAT NONE OF

01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:44.218
US REALLY KNEW I MEAN.

01:28:44.285 --> 01:28:45.720
THIS WAS FLORIDA THIS WAS MANY

01:28:45.787 --> 01:28:47.288
YEARS AGO.

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.357
WHEN I WENT?

01:28:49.424 --> 01:28:50.692
TO MY HIGH SCHOOL.

01:28:50.758 --> 01:28:52.894
HOMECOMING DANCE IS A SENIOR.

01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.896
THE BOY THAT I TOOK TO THE DANCE

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:56.464
WAS GAY.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.498
AGAIN NOTHING THAT WAS SPOKEN

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:59.600
BUT WE KNOW.

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.501
WE KNOW THAT NOTHING WILL COME

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:02.603
OF THAT NIGHT BEYOND FRIENDSHIP.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:03.938
BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THOSE

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:05.206
TWO INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT THEIR

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.407
LIVES MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE AT

01:29:06.474 --> 01:29:08.643
THAT TIME. TO KNOW THAT THEY

01:29:08.710 --> 01:29:10.945
WERE LIVING A LIE.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:11.946
AND TO BE AFRAID OF BEING

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.581
EXPOSED TO BE SO AFRAID THAT

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:15.349
THEY HAD TO DATE.

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.251
IN MY CASE A GIRL.

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:19.754
MY GIRLFRIEND'S CASE BOYS.

01:29:19.821 --> 01:29:21.189
WHEN THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE LAST

01:29:21.255 --> 01:29:23.991
PERSON THEY WANTED TO BE DATING?

01:29:24.058 --> 01:29:25.126
AND TO THINK THAT ON TOP OF THAT

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:41.642

THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:45.779
SO IF YOU HAD RESERVATIONS AND

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:48.048

02:04:49.582 --> 02:04:50.616
FOR THIS TRAILER BILL PROPOSES A

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:51.784
SUBSTANTIAL -- INCREASING

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:52.885
ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICARE ALL AND

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:53.652
THAT INCREASE WILL COME AT A

02:04:53.719 --> 02:04:54.186
SUBSTANTIAL COST TO THE

02:04:57.690 --> 02:04:59.458

STATE OF THESE NEW ENROLLEES

02:05:00.993 --> 02:05:02.895

02:05:02.962 --> 02:05:04.063
IT SPENDS CURRENTLY ON A WOMAN

02:05:04.129 --> 02:05:05.965
IN MEDI CAL THAT'S BECAUSE THESE

02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:06.799

02:05:06.866 --> 02:05:10.035

UNABLE TO SEE A DOCTOR.

02:05:29.622 --> 02:05:30.723

02:05:30.789 --> 02:05:32.958
DOCTORS IN MY DISTRICT ARE ABLE

02:05:33.025 --> 02:05:34.994

PUBLIC EMPLOYEES BY RULE ALMOST

02:16:15.734 --> 02:16:17.602
ALWAYS NOT ONLY HAVE PRIDE IN

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.271
WHAT THEY DO THEY WANT TO MAKE

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:21.673

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:25.076
YOU WANT SOMEONE THAT THEY HAS A

02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:26.678
VESTED INTEREST IN DOING THE

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:30.081

02:16:40.926 --> 02:16:42.961
BUT IT ALSO GIVES BODY THE

02:16:43.028 --> 02:16:45.096
FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:47.866

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:06.451
WHICH MEANS THEY IGNORE US MOST

02:17:06.518 --> 02:17:08.420

RISE AND CAUTIOUS SUPPORT.

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:52.163
OF FLOOD OF THIS A CA.

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.967
I I DO BELIEVE THAT CONTRACTING

02:22:56.034 --> 02:22:56.768
OUT.

02:22:56.834 --> 02:22:58.369
I AND ITS IMPACT ON WAGES AND

02:22:58.436 --> 02:23:00.505
BENEFITS AS A REAL ISSUE FOR

02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:03.341
WORKERS AND I COMMEND THE MEMBER

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:06.577
FROM -- SAN DIEGO FOR WORKING SO

02:23:06.644 --> 02:23:09.714
HARD ON ON THIS ISSUE.

02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:11.282
BUT I I DO HAVE A NUMBER OF

02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:15.853
CONCERNS -- WE JUST HEARD THE

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.288
ESTIMATE OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:19.357
MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT THIS

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.826
COULD COST THE UC ACTUALLY HAS

02:23:21.893 --> 02:23:23.328
THAT NUMBER UP AROUND A HUNDRED

02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:25.296
AND SEVENTY TWO MILLION WHAT

02:23:25.363 --> 02:23:28.633
EVER THE COST MAY BE WE HAVE.

02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:32.136
TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THAT COST.

02:23:32.203 --> 02:23:34.339
PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN WE

02:23:34.405 --> 02:23:36.841
HAVE ADDED AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:38.076
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:23:38.142 --> 02:23:40.178
BUDGET WITH AN EMPHASIS ON

02:23:40.244 --> 02:23:42.447
INCREASING ENROLLMENT WELL THIS

02:23:42.513 --> 02:23:44.315
IS A REAL ISSUE.

02:23:44.382 --> 02:23:47.852
TOO AND I TAKE THE POINT THAT.

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.988
AS A MATTER OF FLYING MALADY

02:23:50.054 --> 02:23:51.656
THIS CAN ONLY BE CHANGED A

02:23:51.723 --> 02:23:53.524
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT BUT

02:23:53.591 --> 02:23:56.427
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY THE CASE WE

02:23:56.494 --> 02:23:58.997
CAN ALSO CHANGE THIS BY USING

02:23:59.063 --> 02:23:59.931
THE POWER OF THE PURSE THAT WE

02:23:59.998 --> 02:24:00.665
HAVE.

02:24:00.732 --> 02:24:03.735
JUST AS WE HAVE WITH UNIVERSITY

02:24:03.801 --> 02:24:05.803
AND ROLL MEANT -- WE'VE CHANGED

02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:07.972
THE DYNAMIC ON THAT AND WE COULD

02:24:08.039 --> 02:24:09.574
WORK HARDER TO CHANGE THE

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:11.843
DYNAMIC THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS FOR

02:24:11.909 --> 02:24:14.112
THE BUDGET PROCESS WHICH I THINK

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:16.948
IS FAVORABLE MORE FAVORABLE TO

02:24:17.015 --> 02:24:19.517
DOING SOMETHING THAT IS RIGID

02:24:19.584 --> 02:24:21.919
AND INFLEXIBLE ONCE IT IS PUT

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.421
INTO CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.

02:24:23.488 --> 02:24:26.057
WE KNOW HOW BALLOT MEASURES ARE.

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:28.760
WE WE WITH OUR OWN LEGISLATION

02:24:28.826 --> 02:24:30.862
FREQUENTLY COME BACK TO CLEAN UP

02:24:30.928 --> 02:24:33.197
THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THE

02:24:33.264 --> 02:24:35.933
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WE WILL

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.303
NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH A

02:24:39.370 --> 02:24:40.738
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.

02:24:40.805 --> 02:24:43.941
I'M I'M VOTING FOR THIS TODAY I

02:24:44.008 --> 02:24:46.077
AM HOPING THAT COOLER HEADS WILL

02:24:46.144 --> 02:24:47.545
PREVAIL AND THAT THERE CAN BE A

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:50.248
NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION TO THIS SO

02:24:50.314 --> 02:24:53.384
THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE CALM.

02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:57.288
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT --

02:24:57.355 --> 02:25:01.592
BUT FOR TODAY I'M AN AYE VOTE.

02:25:01.659 --> 02:25:02.994
THING WAS BLOW SENIOR ADDITIONAL

02:25:03.061 --> 02:25:07.098
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE ACA.

02:25:07.165 --> 02:25:08.766
MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE.

02:25:08.833 --> 02:25:10.401
I WANT TO REMIND THIS BODY OF A

02:25:10.468 --> 02:25:12.470
FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL -- THIS

02:25:12.537 --> 02:25:13.771
IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MA'AM IT'S

02:25:13.838 --> 02:25:15.373
GOING TO BE PUT TO VOTERS IF WE

02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.774
PASS IT THROUGH FOR THE VOTERS

02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:18.142
TO DECIDE.

02:25:18.209 --> 02:25:19.477
AND FOR THE VOTERS I THINK TO

02:25:19.544 --> 02:25:21.079
HAVE AN HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:25:21.145 --> 02:25:22.513
HOW MUCH WE'RE INVESTING OR NOT

02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:23.948
INVESTING IN YOU SEE I THINK

02:25:24.015 --> 02:25:26.417
THAT'S A GOOD DISCUSSION TO HAVE.

02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:28.352
IN A GOOD US.

02:25:28.419 --> 02:25:30.388
QUESTION TO PUT TO OUR VOTERS.

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:31.956
ALSO RIO ONE REMIND FOLKS THAT

02:25:32.023 --> 02:25:33.758
THIS BILL THIS IS BEEN BROUGHT

02:25:33.825 --> 02:25:35.593
FORWARD AS A BILL -- I THINK AYE

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:37.495
JOCKEYED IT FOR THREE THREE

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:38.663
TIMES ON THIS FLOOR.

02:25:38.729 --> 02:25:40.164
GOT TO THE GOVERNOR AND YOU SEE

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.833
INSISTS THAT WE CAN'T IN FACT

02:25:41.899 --> 02:25:43.267
MAKE THEM DO THIS.

02:25:43.334 --> 02:25:44.202
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT.

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:46.237
THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.071
AND I KNOW THOSE OF YOU OF WORK

02:25:47.138 --> 02:25:49.440
THROUGH BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS WITH

02:25:49.507 --> 02:25:50.975
YOU SEE OF HER THAT AS WELL.

02:25:51.042 --> 02:25:52.243
SO WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO TELL

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:53.845
US THAT THEY CANNOT.

02:25:53.911 --> 02:25:55.646
BE FORCED TO PROTECT THEIR

02:25:55.713 --> 02:25:56.981
LOWEST WAGE WORKERS THEY

02:25:57.048 --> 02:25:58.916
CONTINUE TO PAY THEIR HIGHEST

02:25:58.983 --> 02:25:59.784
WAGE WORKERS MORE.

02:25:59.851 --> 02:26:01.686
ADMINISTRATORS.

02:26:01.752 --> 02:26:04.188
I DON'T LIKE HAVING TO DO A

02:26:04.255 --> 02:26:05.523
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR

02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:08.159
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS.

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.961
WE SHOULD JUST BE.

02:26:10.027 --> 02:26:11.829
FIGURING OUT TOGETHER.

02:26:11.896 --> 02:26:14.665
HOW TO PAY FOR THESE -- WORKERS.

02:26:14.732 --> 02:26:15.600
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:17.835
POSITION WE'RE IN AND CONTINUE

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.604
TO BE AN BECAUSE THE WAY THE

02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:21.839
CONSTITUTION IS WRITTEN.

02:26:21.906 --> 02:26:22.907
SO IF YOU SEE TRULY IS A THOMAS

02:26:22.974 --> 02:26:24.742
I KNOW THE CONSTITUTION IS THERE

02:26:24.809 --> 02:26:26.177
TO PROTECT.

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:29.480
THOSE WHO ARE THE LEAST AMONG US.

02:26:29.547 --> 02:26:30.815
SO PERHAPS IT IS THE MOST

02:26:30.882 --> 02:26:32.316
APPROPRIATE. TO GIVE

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:33.317
CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS TO

02:26:33.384 --> 02:26:34.752
THE LEAST.

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:37.388
PAID WORKERS THE WORKERS WHO DO

02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:39.624
THE REAL WORK ON UC CAMPUS WHO

02:26:39.690 --> 02:26:41.559
WILL NEVER HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING

02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:42.593
POWER.

02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:44.929

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:52.770

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:53.871
ARE YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE REAL

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:55.573

02:26:55.640 --> 02:26:56.774
IS.

02:26:56.841 --> 02:26:58.309
BUT WE LET THE VOTERS DECIDE

02:26:58.376 --> 02:26:59.810
WHETHER THEY'RE NOT THEY THINK

02:26:59.877 --> 02:27:02.346
IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO PROTECT

02:27:02.413 --> 02:27:03.381
UC WORKERS.

02:27:03.447 --> 02:27:05.783
