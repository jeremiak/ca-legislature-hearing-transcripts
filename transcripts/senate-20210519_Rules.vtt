IT TO ALL THREE OF YOU. ARE

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:40.445
BECAUSE THEY'RE ON OUR MIND AND

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:42.147
ONE HALF TO DO- THE CONCERNS

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.448
THAT OF ARE RAISED IN THE DRAFT

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:44.582
TWENTY TWO CALIBER. MATH FOR. I

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:46.751
KNOW THAT COMING BEFORE. A ONE

00:29:46.818 --> 00:29:50.455
OF DODD COMMITTEES. HONDA I

00:29:50.522 --> 00:29:52.657
GUESS IF THE CONCERN IS THAT

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.259
XCELERATED MATHIS CERTAINLY IS

00:29:54.325 --> 00:29:55.827
NOT FOR EVERYONE AND CERTAINLY

00:29:55.894 --> 00:29:57.395
IT WASN'T FOR ME HI FIND THAT

00:29:57.462 --> 00:30:00.131
WASN'T MY STRONG SUIT. I MADE

00:30:00.198 --> 00:30:02.267
IT THROUGH THAT I'M HOPING THAT

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:03.535
WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT SOMETHING

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:05.069
THAT MIGHT ENCOURAGE ALL

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.172
STUDENTS TO STRIVE FOR MORE AND

00:30:07.238 --> 00:30:08.006
I THINK OF SPECIALLY ARE YOUNG

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:10.942
WOMEN. WE HAVE STEM AND THAT

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:12.577
HAS ENCOURAGED SO MANY TO GET

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:13.778
INVOLVED IN FACT THERE'S SO

00:30:13.845 --> 00:30:15.480
MANY JUST AN ORANGE COUNTY-

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:21.886
THERE ON EDUCATION PATH TO DO

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:23.922

LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THE

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:33.498
FINAL PROPOSAL THAT WILL COME

00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:35.833

CONTROVERSY OVER THE YEARS

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.071
MEMBER THE NEW MATH AND- WITH

AGAIN WE HAVE TO REMEMBER- IT'S

00:33:15.293 --> 00:33:18.262
A FRAMEWORK OF MATHEMATICS AND

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:21.766
FRAMEWORKS ARE OUR GUIDES

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.434
THEY'RE NOT MANDATED IN THE

00:33:23.501 --> 00:33:25.103
PROCESS THEY'RE NOT MANDATED

00:33:25.169 --> 00:33:27.872
FOR DISTRICTS TO TEACH FROM- WE

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:29.640
WANT THIS PROCESS TO PLAY OUT

00:33:29.707 --> 00:33:32.477

STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THEN

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:38.349
WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT.

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:42.854
AND- AND DECIDE THEN WHETHER TO

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.989
APPROVE IT OR NOT YOU KNOW THE

00:33:45.056 --> 00:33:47.925
FRAMEWORK- IS GUIDES FOR LOCAL

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:50.428
DISTRICTS- IN THOSE DISTRICTS

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:52.130
MAKE DECISIONS ON WHAT IS

00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:54.365
OFFERED FOR THEIR DISTRICT

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:59.670
THERE LOCALLY- YOU KNOW I WOULD

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:01.639
WANT CHILDREN TO HAVE OPTIONS

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.608
STILL WITH THE HIGH LEVEL MATH

00:34:03.674 --> 00:34:05.610
AS WELL AS C. D. E. AND CAREER

00:34:05.676 --> 00:34:07.979

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.847
AND- THOSE KIND OF OPTIONS AND-

00:34:09.914 --> 00:34:11.682
I WOULD HOPE THAT THE DISTRICT

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.384
WOULD HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY FOR

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.286
THOSE VARIOUS PATHWAYS. YOU

00:34:15.353 --> 00:34:17.321
KNOW WHETHER IT'S A STUDENT ON

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:18.289
THEIR WAY TO THE UNIVERSITY

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:20.324
CALIFORNIA OR STUDENTS WHO

00:34:20.391 --> 00:34:23.661
NEEDS MATHEMATICS TO BE ABLE TO

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:26.464
BE A PLUMBER OR A BUILDER- WE

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.299
WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE OPTIONS IN

00:34:28.366 --> 00:34:30.334
THESE PATHWAYS FOR ALL OF OUR

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:34.939
STUDENTS. AND OF COURSE WE

00:34:35.006 --> 00:34:36.073
DON'T WANT TO SEE SOME OF THOSE

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.142
HIGHER LEVEL MATHS ELIMINATED I

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:38.543
KNOW THERE'S SOME

00:34:38.609 --> 00:34:40.411
MISINFORMATION CIRCULATING

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.713
ABOUT ELIMINATING CALCULUS FOR

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:43.614
SOME OF THESE HIGH LEVEL MATHS

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:47.118
WE NEED TO. KEEP THOSE OPTIONS

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:48.986
AVAILABLE FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:34:49.053 --> 00:34:50.354
THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING OUT

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:52.123
BECAUSE I THINK THAT MIGHT BE

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.291
WHERE THE CONTROVERSY IS KIND

00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:55.560
OF THE MERCHANT MAYBE. A LITTLE

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.662
BIT A LITTLE TIDBITS GETTING IN

00:34:57.728 --> 00:34:59.030
THE MEDIA ON THAT I COULDN'T

00:34:59.096 --> 00:35:00.631
IMAGINE THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:02.333
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PART OF

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.502
IT. NOT NOT NECESSARILY

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:13.044
MANDATED SO IT. YES THANK YOU

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.113
SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND I

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.083
WILL- WHAT REPEAT EVERYTHING

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.884
THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:22.453
SAT. UP I AGREE WITH THEM AND I

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.789
WILL JUST ADD THAT. WHEN I

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:26.991
STARTED TEACHING IN ABIT ON

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:28.926
BECAUSE I'M A SOCIAL STUDIES

00:35:28.993 --> 00:35:30.995
ENGLISH AND SPANISH TEACHER AT

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:33.364
THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL BUT WHEN

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:34.966
I STARTED TEACHING AB ONE OF

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:37.301
THE- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:35:37.368 --> 00:35:38.503
DISCOVERED IS THAT A LOT OF MY

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:40.638
STUDENTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR

00:35:40.705 --> 00:35:42.206
GRADE LEVEL IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:44.542
STRUGGLING WITH MATH. AND SO I

00:35:44.609 --> 00:35:46.210
THOUGHT WELL HOW CAN I HELP

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:46.911
WITH IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.679
SINCE I'VE HAD A HIGH SCHOOL

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.749
MATH R. SO I STARTED A BOOK.

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:52.884
OUT WITH THAT WITH PROFESSOR

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:54.752
JAVELIN WHO'S A MATHEMATICS

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:57.321
PROFESSOR AT STANFORD. LATER HE

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.056
AND I BECAME VERY GOOD FRIENDS

00:35:59.123 --> 00:36:01.359
AND I LEARNED A LOT. FROM HIM

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:03.361
ABOUT MATHEMATICAL THINKING AND

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:05.930
MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS AND THE

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:09.634
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.537
ENCOURAGE OUR STUDENTS- YOU

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:14.906
MATHEMATICALLY TO. PROBLEMS HOW

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.307
TO OUT THE MOVE IN A LOT OF

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.209
DIFFERENT AREAS IN THEIR LIFE.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:21.112
AND STILL. SOME OF OUR

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.781
STUDENTS- YOU KNOW WILL TAKE UP

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.484
PERHAPS. MAY REQUIRE LESS MATH

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.519
I THINK YOU KNOW WE ALL CERTAIN

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:31.923
CAREERS- WHETHER YOU ARE EIGHT

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:35.893
HOUSE FRAME BURKE OR- A DOCTOR

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.894
ARE RIGHT YOU KNOW THERE'S%

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:38.329
CERTAIN. CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:39.363
MATTHEW USED FOR CERTAIN

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:40.965
CAREERS AND AT THAT POINT

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:41.732
THAT'S WHERE WE NEED TO

00:36:41.799 --> 00:36:43.434
DIFFERENTIATE US AT SCHOOLS AND

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.403
THIS IS A LOCAL DECISION. AGAIN

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.837
WITH THIS FRAMEWORK THAT'S UP

00:36:46.904 --> 00:36:49.307
FOR DISCUSSION. ARE WE AS

00:36:49.373 --> 00:36:51.409
TEACHERS NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.010
WHAT MATH OUR STUDENTS NEED FOR

00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:54.111
THE CAREERS OF THEIR INTERESTED

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:56.547
IN WITHOUT HOLDING ANYBODY.

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.749
WITHOUT YOU KNOW- WHICH IS ONE

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:02.720
OF. THE ONE OF THE MYTHS ABOUT-

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:05.156
THIS. IS THAT YOU KNOW. HELP IS

00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:06.524
GOING TO BE GONE AND PEOPLE

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:07.758
WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT NO

00:37:07.825 --> 00:37:10.227
NOT AT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WE

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:13.130
NEED STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:37:13.197 --> 00:37:14.398
FOR ENGINEERING JOBS FOR JOBS

00:37:14.465 --> 00:37:16.467
AND AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND A

00:37:16.534 --> 00:37:18.035
LOT OF THOSE REQUIRE A STRONG

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:20.538
MATHEMATICAL BACKGROUND. RIGHT

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:22.873
WHETHER OR ENGINEERING OF. MOB

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.042
MEMBER MCCLELLAN MENTIONED- C.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.278
T. AND THOSE PATHWAYS DOES ALSO

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:29.046
REQUIRE CERTAIN TYPE OF MATH

00:37:29.113 --> 00:37:31.616
JOKES ARE IT'S THIS IS A VERY

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.217
INTERESTING DISCUSSION AND-

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:36.020
I'M- LOOKING FORWARD TO- YOU

00:37:36.087 --> 00:37:38.122
KNOW WHEN THIS PROCESS IS OVER

00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:41.726
HAVING. A FRAMEWORK- IN FRONT

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.494
OF US AT YES YOU ARE. STATE

00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.631

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:48.099
THANK YOU FOR THOSE ANSWERS I'M

00:37:48.165 --> 00:37:49.900
I'M SO IMPRESSED WITH ALL THREE

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.102
OF YOU I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:52.003
THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING YUR

00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:54.038
CONFIRMATION NOT. I BROUGHT UP

00:37:54.105 --> 00:37:55.806
THE MATH QUESTION BECAUSE IT IS

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:56.841
SOMETHING THAT COMES SIDE TO

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:59.477
US. AS PARENTS GRANDPARENTS AND

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.612
LEGISLATORS YOU KNOW IT IT IS

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.314
SO PROBABLY THE THING THAT MUCH

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.716
MAYBE. NEXT TO READING OR MAYBE

00:38:05.783 --> 00:38:07.718
ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF READING AS

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.654
CREATES MOST CONSTERNATION ARE

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.955
FOR PARENTS AS THEIR CHILDREN

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.690
STRUGGLE WITH EITHER OF THOSE

00:38:12.757 --> 00:38:15.092
SUBJECTS AND- GIVEN YOUR- ALL

00:38:15.159 --> 00:38:16.694
THREE OF YOU YOUR INVOLVEMENT

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.628
IN YOUR PASSION FOR YOUR

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.463
STUDENTS OF. I THINK WE'LL SEE

00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:20.998
ARE PROBABLY A GREAT PRODUCT

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:22.800
THAT COMES OUT OF THAT ARE WILL

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:24.735
BE FOLLOWING IT AND THEN- ANY

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:26.103
THOUGHTS YOU HAVE THAT YOU WANT

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.139
TO SHARE WITH ME PREVIOUS. TO

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:30.207
THAT- SUBSEQUENT TO THAT THAT

HAPPEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. WE'RE

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:37.635
HAVING IT HAPPEN IN LOS

00:40:37.701 --> 00:40:40.171
ANGELES- WE'RE SEEING IT IN

00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:41.338

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:11.368
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT. WE

00:41:11.435 --> 00:41:13.504
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CREATE

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:14.939
SOME SYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:17.441
FOR STABILITY- IN TERMS OF

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.876
HAVING SUPERINTENDENTS COMING

00:41:18.943 --> 00:41:19.977

00:41:20.044 --> 00:41:21.212
WORK THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:23.280

00:41:27.484 --> 00:41:29.587
EDUCATION TO OUR STUDENTS. AND

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:32.423
FAMILIES BUT I'M WONDERING IF

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.859

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:37.895
SO MUCH- THAT THE YOU KNOW THE

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:40.698
YIELD IS NOT WHAT WE WANT AND

YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. THANK

00:41:43.834 --> 00:41:45.436
YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:48.172
AND I WILL SAY FIRST AND AS A

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:51.642
MOM WHO ALSO. HAD A DAUGHTER ON

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:52.910
DISTANCE LEARNING OVER THIS

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:55.079
LAST YEAR AND IT'S DEFINITELY

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:57.214
BEEN QUITE AN INTERESTING RIDE-

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:58.949
SERVING FROM BOTH ENDS AS A MOM

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:01.785
AND ALSO AS AN EDUCATOR- TO

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.687
YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.789
GOVERNANCE AND THE- SIGNIFICANT

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:08.225
NUMBER OF. THAT MINISTRY-

00:42:08.292 --> 00:42:09.193
SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.562
RESIGNING I WILL SAY THAT I DO

00:42:11.629 --> 00:42:13.063
BELIEVE OUR GOVERNANCE

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.399
STRUCTURE WHILE IT'S NOT- I

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.067
WILL SAY NOT NECESSARILY UNDER

00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:18.869
THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE BOARD

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.338
OF EDUCATION ARE BECAUSE WE DO

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.908
HAVE LOCAL CONTROL. THERE ARE

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:26.543
ON THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AT THE

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:29.580
LOCAL LEVEL FOR SUPERINTENDENT

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:31.048
CAN BE ABLE TO WORK IN

00:42:31.115 --> 00:42:32.917
COLLABORATION WITH THE

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:34.285
GOVERNING BOARDS THAT ARE

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:37.054
ELECTED IN THEIR AREA AND SERVE

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:38.656
THE NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES-

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.391
OF MIGHT I DO THINK THAT THIS

00:42:40.457 --> 00:42:43.460
LAST- FIFTEEN SIXTEEN MONTHS

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:45.195
IT'S BEEN ONE THAT. THE

00:42:45.262 --> 00:42:46.330
VOCABULARY WORDS BEEN

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:47.765
UNPRECEDENTED IT'S SOMETHING

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.833
THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN AND OUR

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.136
PARTICULAR LIFETIME AND I

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:54.905
BELIEVE THAT THE QUICK NEED TO

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:57.241
RESPOND AND IN SHORT AND GIVE

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:59.510
IT TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS GOT

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:01.312
EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD.

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:05.516
DURING. THIS TIME- INSTRUCTION

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.951
CHANGING IN AND TO REMOTE

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.353
INSTRUCTION- REQUIRED A LOT OF

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.989
TIME QUITE A LOT ACTUALLY AND

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:13.390
TO THE POINT I BELIEVE I HEARD

00:43:13.457 --> 00:43:14.992
YOU MAKE ARE THERE WERE.

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:17.594
SUPERINTENDENT DISTRICT

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.295
ADMINISTRATORS PRINCIPALS

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.698
TEACHERS PARA PROFESSIONALS

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:22.132
THAT PUT IN AN INORDINATE

00:43:22.199 --> 00:43:23.767
AMOUNT OF TIME TO TRY TO BE

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.869
SURE STUDENTS COP WITHIN ME. SO

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.472
AS FAR AS IS THERE A NEED TO

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:29.540
LOOK AT OUR GOVERNANCE

00:43:29.606 --> 00:43:30.841
STRUCTURE IS THERE ANY TO

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:32.309
CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.877
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE I THINK

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:35.145
IT'S SOMETHING FOR CONTINUAL

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.981
REFLECTION OR WE SERVE IN OUR

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:38.615
ENVIRONMENT. OF CONTINUOUS

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:39.917
IMPROVEMENT AND WHILE THERE ARE

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.819
THINGS THAT WORK WELL THERE I'M

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.520
SURE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:46.223
BETTER. TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:48.292
THOSE WHO ARE SERVING IN THE

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.660
ROLE OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND

EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THE SYSTEM

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:54.565
AND I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT

00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:57.468
OPPORTUNITY- AS STUDENTS RETURN

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:59.670

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.242
FROM WHAT THOSE AREAS ARE THAT

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.844
WE CAN BUILD ON AND MORE

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:12.893
ITS OWN ECOSYSTEM IT'S ALL

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:13.394

THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES I'M

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:43.691
TRYING TO SUPPORT THE

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:44.959
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MUCH OF

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:47.861
WHAT WE CAN I'M TRYING TO BE OF

01:37:47.928 --> 01:37:49.430
A RESOURCE ON THROUGH MY BOOKS

01:37:49.496 --> 01:37:55.102
ON BOARD. TO ALL TWENTY THREE

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.004

WELL I FORGET WHICH SENIOR

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.643
ADMINISTRATOR SAID THIS COMMENT

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:03.644
BUT IT WAS SOMETHING TO THE

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:07.147
EFFECT THAT- EACH OF THE TWENTY

01:38:07.214 --> 01:38:09.049
THREE CAMPUSES ARE CHILDREN.

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:10.284
AND YOU KNOW YOU LOVE THEM ALL

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.652
BUT IT'S JUST YOU LOVE THEM

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.622
DIFFERENTLY AND AS A MOTHER OF

01:38:14.688 --> 01:38:16.123
FOUR I CAN RELATE TO THAT SO I

01:38:16.190 --> 01:38:17.124
THINK THAT'S THE WAY THAT I

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:18.726
WOULD LOOK AT BEST BET. NO

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:20.928
THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.162
AND HAVE DIFFERENT STRENGTHS

01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:24.431
AND WEAKNESSES AND IT'S

01:38:24.498 --> 01:38:26.267
IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE MYSELF AS

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:28.802
A TRUSTEE- LIKE JACK MENTIONED

01:38:28.869 --> 01:38:30.237
I'D LOOK FORWARD TO VISITING

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:31.839
AND GOING TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:33.507
THE STATE THAT I'M NOT AS

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:36.277
FAMILIAR WITH- AND I THINK IT'S

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.845
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO.

01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:39.613
REALIZE THAT EACH CAMPUS HAS

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.949
DIFFERENT NEEDS AND YOU KNOW

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:43.317
THERE'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.885
BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:38:44.952 --> 01:38:46.253
THERE MAY BE BEST PRACTICES

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.855
ACROSS THE SYSTEM THAT WE CAN

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:50.424
IMPLEMENT SO. I THINK YOU KNOW

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:51.859
HAVING THE BIG PICTURE VIEW BUT

01:38:51.925 --> 01:38:53.260
THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:55.129
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CAMPUS

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.731
ARE IMPORTANT AND- EVEN THOUGH

01:38:57.798 --> 01:39:00.100
I DO HAVE YOU KNOW. MANY CSU'S

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.502
IN MY BACKYARD IN THE BAY AREA

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.637
I DO THINK THAT- YOU KNOW I'M

01:39:03.704 --> 01:39:05.239
JUST AS CURIOUS AND INTERESTED

01:39:05.306 --> 01:39:07.141
TO LEARN ABOUT THE ONES I DON'T

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:08.942
KNOW ABOUT AND YOU KNOW SEE

01:39:09.009 --> 01:39:10.344
WHAT SORT OF PROGRAMS AND

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:13.414
THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING ARE

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:13.947
GOING ON THERE. SO I LOOK

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:21.021
FORWARD TO THAT. MISTER ROMULUS.

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:24.258

CERTAINLY HAVE AN AFFINITY FOR

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:41.208
ONE- BUT TO WHAT I NAMED JACK

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:43.310
SHARED. I AM SO PART OF THE

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:43.977
REASON THAT I HAVE THIS

01:39:44.044 --> 01:39:46.080
AFFINITY AS IT'S BEEN IN MY

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:47.781

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.959

CHANCELLOR- THAT'S THE FIRST

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:13.801
QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:15.436
RELATIONSHIP IS INCREDIBLY

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:16.870
