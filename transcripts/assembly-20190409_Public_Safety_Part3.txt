ITEM NUMBER. THIRTY ONE SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TASKED WITH THE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TASK OF INVESTIGATING INTERMITTENTLY BECAUSE OF A KILLER ACCIDENTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN THE ACCIDENTS INVOLVED SERIOUS DEATH OR INJURY FORTUNATELY THAT MANY TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM TO DO THEIR JOBS -- NEW TOOL THAT THEY HAVE IS DATA FROM THE EVENT DATA RECORDER IN VEHICLES THIS IS A DEVICE SIMILAR TO THE BLACK BOX IN AIRCRAFT THAT RECORDS A LIMITED SET OF PARAMETERS. ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE CAR IN THE SECONDS BEFORE THE CRASH IT TYPICALLY COVERS FIVE SECONDS BEFORE TO ONE SECOND AFTER AND RECORD SUCH PARAMETERS AS THE SPEED -- THE POSITION OF THE ACCELERATOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS THINGS LIKE THAT -- LAW ENFORCEMENT IS EMPOWERED. TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT TO GET ACCESS INVOLUNTARILY TO THE STATE IN THE EVENT OF A FELONY INVESTIGATION -- MOST OF THE OTHER TIMES IT IS CONSENSUAL HOWEVER THERE ARE IMPORTANT OCCASIONS WHERE'S CONSENT CANNOT BE OBTAINED FOR EXAMPLE THAT WHEN THERE'S A SOLE OCCUPANT OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT. OCCUPANT IS KILLED IN THE CRASH OBVIOUSLY THERE'S NO ONE TO GIVE CONSENT SO THIS BILL AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES INVESTIGATING THAT ACCIDENT. THE PATHWAY TO GET ACCESS TO THAT DATA IT WOULD -- REQUIRE THEM TO GET A SEARCH WARRANTS THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONVINCE A JUDGE AS TO THE REASONABLE TEST OF THEIR REQUEST AND THEY WOULD BE ACT -- EMPOWER TO ACCESS ONLY A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF PARAMETERS FROM THE OF THAT DATA RECORDER IN THE VEHICLE. I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE ON THIS BILL THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS I THINK MAKES A GOOD BILL MUCH BETTER THE NARROW THE SCOPE. AND THEY SAID WHAT I FEEL IS AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTION FOR CONSUMER PRIVACY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THESE ACCIDENTS ON THE OTHER SO. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. YOU HAVE ANY WITNESSES OR HERE FOR TECHNICAL ADVICE OR MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. EXISTING LAW DENIES AN OFFICER INVESTIGATING A MISDEMEANOR ACCIDENT WHICH DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY HAS OCCURRED. THE ABILITY TO SEEK A SEARCH WARRANT TO RECOVER THE EVENT DATA RECORDER THE SO CALLED AUTOMOTIVE BLACK BOX. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE DENYING INVESTIGATORS ACCESS TO A BLACK BOX IN AN AIRLINE CRASH LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TASKED WITH INVESTIGATING MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS INVOLVING DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. DETERMINING THE CAUSE OF SUCH ACCIDENTS AND GATHERING EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE IF A MISDEMEANOR PROSECUTION IS APPROPRIATE. ET OUR DATA IS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IT CAN BE CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. CAN CORROBORATE TRADITIONAL ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION CALCULATIONS AND IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL WHEN NO WITNESSES ARE AVAILABLE OR THERE IS A CONFLICT IN THEIR STATEMENTS. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT IS NARROWLY DRAFTED AND APPLIES ONLY TO ACCIDENTS INVOLVING DEATH OR SERIOUS BODILY INJURY. DOES NOT INFRINGE IN ANY WAY ON A PRIVACY RIGHT AND LIKE ALL SEARCH WARRANTS REQUIRES JUDICIAL APPROVAL. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE CURRENTLY NO SUCH RIGHT TO SEEK A SEARCH WARRANT EXISTS WITH REGARD TO A MISDEMEANOR. IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THIS INFORMATION CAN ALREADY BE OBTAINED THROUGH A SUBPOENA. HOWEVER SUBPOENAS OR ISSUED. AFTER CRIMINAL CASES ARE FILED A SEARCH WARRANT IS AN INVESTIGATIVE TOOL BEFORE FILING ONE THAT IS USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER CRIMINAL CHARGES OR EVEN APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION TO ASSISTING IN THE INVESTIGATION OF A POTENTIAL MISDEMEANOR PROSECUTION THE ET ARE BLACK BOX CAN PROVIDE ESSENTIAL EVIDENCE IN CIVIL LAWSUITS. FILED AGAINST DRIVERS OR GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT SOME OF THE MOST CRUCIAL AND SCIENTIFICALLY RELIABLE EVIDENCE REGARDING COLLISION CAUSATION IS INACCESSIBLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DUE TO THIS CURRENT GAP. IN THE LOG AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL CLOSE THAT GAP AND PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS A VALUABLE SCIENTIFIC TOOL TO COMPLETE THEIR INVESTIGATIONS AND THE MOST THOROUGH AND PROFESSIONAL MANNER. CDA URGES DRIVE OF THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD EVENING MR TERRON MEMBERS SAW KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA LAWN SEARCH WARRANTS BOUNCED BALANCES TWO VERY IMPORTANT INTERESTS OF INTEREST THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PROTECTED FROM UNREASONABLE GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES. AND THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES ONE WAY CALIFORNIA LAW DOES THIS IS BY SETTING A GENERAL RULE THAT A WARRANT CAN BE SOUGHT WHEN THE EVIDENCE TO BE SEIZED AS EVIDENCE OF A FELONY. THERE IS NO GENERAL PROVISION ALLOWING ISSUANCE OF A SEARCH WARRANT WHERE WHERE THE THING TO BE SEIZED AS EVIDENCE OF A LESSER CRIME. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WOULD ALLOW ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT FOR INFORMATION FROM A VEHICLE'S RECORDING DEVICE THE CONSTITUTES AN AND EVIDENCE OF ANY PUBLIC OFFENSE INVOLVING A MOTOR VEHICLE. RESULTING IN DEATH OR BODILY INJURY I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY APPLICABLES -- TO AS SINGLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS -- THEY COULD BE SOMETHING WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE VEHICLE INVOLVED IT COULD BE A SEARCH WARRANT -- FOR THE RECORDER FROM THE CAR WHERE THERE'S NO SUSPICION AT ALL THAT THAT THE DRIVER OF THAT CAR WAS AT FAULT -- BY ALLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF A WARRANT FOR THE EXTENSIVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE VEHICLE RECORDING DEVICE AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR WORKING WITH US TODAY TO NARROW WHAT WHAT EVIDENCE WOULD BE. ALLOWED TO BE SOUGHT BUT NONETHELESS THERE THERE STILL IS EXTENSIVE INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN GET FROM THESE RECORDING DEVICES -- FOR NON FELONY OFFENSE AB SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT UPSETS THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE INTERESTS OF CALIFORNIANS IN HAVING THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTED FROM GOVERNMENT SEARCHES AND SEIZURES -- AND INDEED THE NEED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE CRIMES -- IT IS CERTAINLY OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEANS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GET ON THIS KIND OF INFORMATION OUT THERE THERE MAY NOT BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AT ALL AND CERTAINLY. IN CASES WHERE THERE IS NO NO. INTENT TO PROSECUTE THERE ARE WAYS TO GET INFORMATION. FROM THE VEHICLE SUCH AS THROUGH A SUBPOENA -- SO WHEN WHEN A DRIVERS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT AND THERE IS NO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUBPOENA THAT INFORMATION FROM THE VEHICLES DATA RECORDER WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MOVE THE BILL ESTERMAN SECOND. AND THE QUESTION. SO IS IT TRUE THAT THE BILL WOULD ALLOW FOR SEARCH WARRANTS FOR NON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY -- I WOULD BELIEVE THAT STATE CASES IS NOT. WILL IT WOULD ALLOW SEARCH WARRANTS FOR A A PUBLIC OFFENSE WHAT. BY MAKE -- THE WAY THIS MOST OFTEN COMES UP YOU HAVE THEY'RE THE WORST CASES OF AND MANY ROUTE INSTANCES OF PROSECUTORS DEAL WITH. A MISDEMEANOR -- VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER IN WHICH IT'S OF THERE BUT FOR THE GRACE OF GOD THING SOMEBODY'S INATTENTIVE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME -- REACHING OVER AND YOU KNOW DOING SOMETHING AND DRIVES OFF THE ROTOR CAUSES A COLLISION. OR SOMETHING. THAT'S A THAT'S POTENTIALLY A MISDEMEANOR ENABLE IT YOU'RE YOU'RE REQUIRED TO OBSERVE A CERTAIN -- CAUTION THE THE ORDINARY PERSON WOULD WHILE YOU'RE OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE -- THE THIS WOULD ALLOW AN INVESTIGATOR TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE WAS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE CAR SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER CRIMINAL CHARGES IT'S A MISDEMEANOR IN THIS CASE WOULD EVEN BE APPROPRIATE. WE FILE MISDEMEANORS PROSECUTORS FILE MISDEMEANORS EVERY DAY -- UNFORTUNATELY IN MISDEMEANOR -- VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER CASES -- BECAUSE A PERSON WAS AN ATTENTIVE ON THE ROAD AND SOMEONE DIED OR WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AS A RESULT OF IT. THIS IS JUST AN INVESTIGATIVE TOOL -- TO ALLOW AN OFFICER -- TO MAKE A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION USING THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE THE BLACK BOX TO DETERMINE IN A VERY NARROW FIVE SECOND PERIOD WHETHER ANYTHING WAS GOING ON WITH THE CAR. THAT COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING OR EXONERATING FACTOR. DOES IT IS TO THEY SO YOU DOES NOT CONCERNING THIS COULD SERVE AFTER SERVE OPEN THE DOOR IN A WAY THAT. CAN BE VERY CONCERNING THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BE A SURCHARGE FOR NON CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. YES CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT IS A CONCERN -- I I ALSO QUESTION. IF IT IS LIMITED TO CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THEN I'M NOT SURE IF IT GETS OUT THE SITUATION OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OLD OBERNOLTE HAS. HAS CITED -- BUT YEAH WE WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ANY -- SEARCH WARRANT BEING USED IT WHETHER IT THERE IS NO -- CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INVOLVED IN AGAIN I YOU KNOW I I I CERTAINLY AM NO EXPERT IN HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATES-- INCIDENCES. WHERE THERE IS NO CRIME SUSPECTED BUT BUT I THINK THAT THEY DO HAVE MEANS OTHER THAN SEARCH WARRANTS AT THEIR? AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO GET INFORMATION OUT TO TO BE CLEAR WE DISAGREE WITH THE ACLU'S ASSESSMENT THAT A SUBPOENA COULD BE USED IN THOSE KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES. THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT REALLY HAS NO TOOLS WHEN THERE'S A SOLE OCCUPANT OF VEHICLE THE HE'S THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE. AND UNFORTUNATELY IS DECEASED AS A RESULT OF THE ACCIDENT. IN THE IN THE SITUATION YOU DESCRIBED WOULDN'T IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT IF THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE IF YOU WERE ABLE TO SHOW PROBABLE CAUSE OUT IN A MISDEMEANOR NOT IN AS SOON AS YOU CAN ONLY DO A PROBABLE. HEARING IN A BALLOT A MISDEMEANOR THE SUBPOENA CAN ONLY BE ISSUED AFTER THIS IS WHERE WE DISAGREE WITH OUR FRIENDS FROM THE DEAL YOU ONLY AFTER A CASE HAS BEEN FILED -- SEARCH WARRANT IS AN INVESTIGATIVE TOOL TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED RIGHT. SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANY PROBABLE CAUSE STANDARD WHICH WE HAVE IN FELONY SETTING IS THAT RIGHT ABSOLUTELY WOULD HAVE PROBABLE CAUSE BECAUSE IT'S GOT TO GO TO A JUDGE. YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD A JUDGE AND THE JUDGE WOULD DO A PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU'RE ONLY ONE YOU HAVE GOT BRING AFFIDAVIT OF PROBABLE CAUSE TO THE JUDGE HE WHICH SHE WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW IT AND DETERMINE THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE. FOR ISSUANCE OF THE SEARCH WARRANT GOT THANK YOU FOR CLARIFICATION. YES MISTER LACKEY I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT QUALIFIES AS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO BECAUSE IT. IN THE BILL IT TALKS ABOUT A PUBLIC OFFENSE WHICH CAL ALSO INCLUDE JUST A FRACTION LIKE RUNNING A RED LIGHT. AND SO MANY OF THESE INSTANCES YOU HAVE. AND AND MANSLAUGHTER CASES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DEATH. AND MANY OF THESE CASES ARE JUST VERY VERY SERIOUS INJURIES AND ONE THING THAT. THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE USED. EXCESSIVELY BECAUSE IT IT TAKES A HIGH LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND UNDERSTANDING TO EVEN. COLLECT THIS DATA AND UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET WHAT IT WHAT IT SAYS -- THIS EVENT DATA RECORDER IS. EVIDENTIARY VALUE THAT SHOULD BE ACCESSED AND THERE'S THERE'S PROTECTION OF PRIVACY BECAUSE YOU'RE HAVING THE JUDICIAL REVIEW LIKE I WOULD HOPE WE ALL WOULD TRUST THE JUDGE WOULD MAKE. THE APPROPRIATE ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER THERE'S PROBABLE CAUSE. TO ACCESS THIS INFORMATION AND SO I THINK THERE'S A BUILT IN PROTECTION THERE AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. BECAUSE ACCURACY INVESTIGATIONS ARE SOCIAL PIVOTAL AND NOT JUST IN. OF MANSLAUGHTER CASES RIGHT A LOT OF TIMES YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. LOST FUNCTION AND WHO HAVE LOST -- THE ABILITY TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS ACTED INAPPROPRIATELY BUT YET THEY HAVE A VERBAL DEFENSE. AND LEST WE HAVE PHYSICAL DEFENSE TO REFUTE THAT BECAUSE VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO ARRIVE AT A POINT OF JUSTICE AND SO I'VE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISS OBERNOLTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THE NEED TO PROTECT CONSUMER PRIVACY AND THE CONSUMERS INFORMATION IN. THE EVENT DATA RECORDER AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE CRAFTED THIS SO NARROWLY. IN SUCH A A VERY LIMITED WAY SO TO BE CLEAR YOU'D HAVE TO OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT WHICH MEANS CONVINCING A JUDGE. THAT. THE NEED FOR THE INFORMATION WAS ACCURATE -- AND AND WE HAVE NARROWED THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO ONLY CERTAIN PARAMETERS OF THE EDR SO THIS WOULD NOT BE A FISHING EXPEDITION. FOR PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH OTHER PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE STORED ON THIS THIS IS JUST A VERY RELEVANT DATA IN THE SECONDS LEADING UP TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE COLLISION SO THIS WOULD BE. I THINK A VALUABLE NEEDED TOOL AND I RICH RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IPHONE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE AND I I BELIEVE I WAS A NO AND THEN -- HE TOOK SOME AMENDMENTS AND THEN WE GOT SOME. SOME MORE INFORMATION REALLY ABOUT. WHAT? WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW AND THAT'S WHY I WENT TO A NON -- IN -- IN A BECAUSE I'M NOT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE. THIS FULLY BAKED BEFORE WE WE LEFT AND I AM NOT SURE. WITH THE OBJECTIONS OF THE OF THE OPPOSITION IF WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THERE RIGHT NOW. UP AND SO -- I HONESTLY BELIEVES TWO OF THE TWO SIDES GOT TOGETHER. AND FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE. THE SEARCH WOMAN'S WARS DID NOT. GET TOO INTRUSIVE -- IT WOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT BUT BECAUSE OF TIME AND IT'S JUST BEEN REALLY. DIFFICULT -- SO WITH THAT A CALL FOR A VOTE. MISTER CHAIR IF I MIGHT A NICE IT AT I'M SIDE IT'LL ALLOW. ALL RIGHT. ANYONE ELSE AND IS NOT USED TO SEVEN BE AS CONSISTENT AS POSSIBLE. OTHERWISE I'D HAVE WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUES COMING AFTER ME FOR CUTTING THEM OFF [inaudible] OF ON A. B. SIXTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JOHN SO YOU'RE NOT VOTING LACKEY AYE LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAN CAN GO NEXT. ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN ELEVEN TWENTY ONE BY OUR QUE HAN. FIREARMS PROHIBITED [inaudible] PERSONS. WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT PROHIBITIVE. THE LAST TWO DAYS. HELLO CHAIR IN COMMITTEE. I WILL KEEP THIS AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE ADD TâM PRESENTING AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE AND BUILD THE BALANCES TREATMENT NEEDS OF A DEFENDANT WITH PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. AN SP TWO FIFTEEN SENATOR BELLS BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW CREATING MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. PROGRAMS ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMITTED CRIMES IN WHICH THEY ARE CERTIFIED. IN WHICH THEY'RE CERTIFIED TO SUFFER FROM MENTAL ILLNESS -- AND THE MENTAL THIS IS A FACTOR CRIME TO ENTER INTO THESE PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR SYSTEM AND ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GET TREATMENT OUTSIDE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM [inaudible] BUT LIKE OTHER DIVERSION PROGRAMS IN OUR SYSTEM IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT. TO HAVE THEIR FIREARMS WALL GOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM. CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS HAVE INTERACTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT SUCH AS FOR MENTAL HEALTH EVALUATION THEY'RE PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS FOR FIVE YEARS. ALSO ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO COMMUNICATES THREATS OF VIOLENCE TO A PSYCHOTHERAPIST ARE ALSO PROHIBITED FROM POSSESSING FIREARMS OR FIVE YEARS AND UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ENTER THIS MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM. TO SURRENDER THEIR FIRE ARMS. AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD MAKE THE PROHIBITION OF FIREARMS AS A CONDITION FOR ENTERING THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS. AT THE END OF THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM AN INDIVIDUAL MAY PETITION THE COURT TO GET HIS OR HER FIRE ARM BACK WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS LD LEWIS ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. GOOD EVENING GOOD EVENING. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE MY NAME IS L. D. LEWIS AND I'M AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND THE HEAD OF THE MENTAL HEALTH UNIT AND I'VE BEEN -- WORKING IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR NEARLY A DECADE -- AND I'M ONE OF THE SPONSORS WE ARE ONE OF THE SPONSORS FOR ELEVEN TWENTY ONE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- NANCY O'MALLEY I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. FOR REQUIRING INDIVIDUALS AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL OFFENSES TO RELINQUISH DANGEROUS AND DEADLY WEAPONS WHILE THEY UNDERGO TREATMENT -- IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAM THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS SOUND PUBLIC POLICY AND INCREASES BOTH THE PERSONAL SAFETY OF THE INDIVIDUAL ENTERING TREATMENT AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY. AND NOW THERE'S A LOT OF LITERATURE OUT THERE INCLUDING -- FROM THE HARVARD PUBLIC HEALTH -- SCHOOL THAT TALKS ABOUT -- THE SERIOUS THREAT FOR SUICIDES WHEN INDIVIDUALS -- HAVE FIRE ARMS IT'S THE MOST LETHAL -- WEAPON THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE WHEN THEY'RE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. OF A NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT ONE LETHAL MEANS ARE MADE LESS AVAILABLE -- LESS DEADLY OR LESS DEADLY SUICIDE RATES BY THAT METHOD DECLINE AND FREQUENTLY SUICIDE RATES OVERALL DECLINE -- ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH THAT'S OUT THERE -- THE BECAUSE OF THE LEASE THE RATE OF SUICIDE IS BOTH THE EASE OF USE IN THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE WEAPON. THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE USING TO HARM THEMSELVES. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REMOVE EXCESS ABILITY TO DANGEROUS OR DEADLY WEAPONS AT A CRITICAL TIME WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF THEIR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS -- SO SEVERE THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY COMMITTING CRIMINAL OFFENSES. IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS UNDER EXISTING LAW ACCESS TO DANGEROUS OR DEADLY WEAPONS IS PROHIBITED. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DEEMED NOT COMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL ARE REQUIRED TO RELINQUISH THEIR DANGEROUS OR DEADLY WEAPONS. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED NO OFFENSES BUT ARE COMMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL DUE TO ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS PURSUANT TO WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE. FIFTY ONE FIFTY ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO RELINQUISH THEIR DANGEROUS OR DEADLY WEAPONS THIS AMENDMENT WOULD BRING THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION Là INTO ALIGNMENT WITH CURRENT PUBLIC POLICY IN EXISTING LAW. FOR A DECADE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN FORMAL MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION FOR MISDEMEANORS. UNDER THE NEW MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION Là VIOLENT OFFENSES ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COMMITTED DANGEROUS OFFENSES SUCH AS FELONY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT WITH GREAT BODILY INJURY. AND BATTERY WITH SERIOUS INJURY ARE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION UNDER THE CURRENT LAW. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SEVERE STABBING CASE WERE GREAT BODILY INJURY IS ALLEGED WHICH IS PENDING MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION IN MY COUNTY -- AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD REDUCE THE RISK OF HARM TO OTHERS IN PARTICULAR -- IN SERIOUS FELONY CASES OF DIVERSION AS GRANITE. THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES THE INDIVIDUAL THE INDIVIDUALS MENTAL DISORDER WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THE CHARGED OFFENSE. THIS MEANS THAT THE CRIMINAL CONDUCT THE INDIVIDUAL EXHIBIT EXHIBIT -- THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS IS A DRIVING FACTOR IN THE COMMISSION OF THAT CONDUCT. NOW WE HAVE LIMITED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN OUR JAIL ONE ALAMEDA COUNTY AND WE DO NOT INVOLUNTARY. MEDICATE IMAGE INMATES WHILE THEY'RE IN CUSTODY. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD ENSURE THAT IS INDIVIDUALS ARE STEPPING DOWN -- OUT OF CUSTODY AND INTO TREATMENT THAT THEY WOULD DO SO IN THE SAFEST MANNER POSSIBLE BOTH RISK FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR OTHERS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A LIFETIME BAN BUDGET A JUDGE CAN RETURN DANGEROUS AND DEADLY WEAPONS TO INDIVIDUALS AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. AND IF THE COURTS DEEM THAT IT'S SAFE TO DO SO WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS COMMONSENSE CHANGE TO THE MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] CHECK IN. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD EVENING [inaudible] EVENING NOW [inaudible] THING RIGHT. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW -- LD AND I FOUGHT. AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. AND I THOUGHT I'D RETIRED. BUT THAT BEING SAID -- THANK YOU I REALLY WANT TO REACH OUT AND THANK THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF -- WE APPRECIATE THE PROFFERED AMENDMENT AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY REASONABLE THAT SOMEONE WOULD GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS FOR THE DURATION OF THE MENTAL HEALTH -- DIVERSION. WHAT IS NOT REASONABLE ABOUT AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS THAT BASICALLY IT WOULD TREAT CALIFORNIANS WHO ACCEPT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT? AND HAVE NEVER COMMITTED A CRIME SOMEONE WHO HAS NO CRIMINAL RECORD MORE HARSHLY THAN THOSE WHO REFUSE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY CONVICTED OF A CRIMINAL OFFENSE. IN THAT RESPECT AB TWO ELEVEN TWENTY ONE UNDERMINES EXISTING LAW IN ITS GOAL TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM SUFFERING THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE CRIMINAL CONVICTION WHILE PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. ALTHOUGH -- MISS LEWIS HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENT OFFENSES. YOU MIGHT ALSO FIND PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMMITTED NONVIOLENT OFFENSES SHOPLIFTING WHATEVER AND THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MENTAL ILLNESSES THAT DO NOT HAVE IN THE APPRECIABLE RECORD. FOR VIOLENCE -- CLINICAL DEPRESSION WE DON'T HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT PEOPLE GOING OUT AND COMMITTING VIOLENT OFFENSES WHO ARE CLINICALLY DEPRESSED. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS IF THEY CHOOSE TO ACCEPT DIVERSION ARE ACCEPTING WHAT IN MOST URBAN COUNTIES WOULD BE. ON A MUCH MORE ONEROUS COURSE THEN IF THEY JUST ACCEPTED WHAT WOULD BE THE TYPICAL PLEA BARGAIN. IN OAKLAND OR LA WHICH WOULD BE CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED. PROBATION AND OUTDOOR. AND IF THEY ACCEPTED THAT. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE PROHIBITION AGAINST WEAPONS. THEY JUST BE GOING ON ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS [inaudible] SO. THE VERSION MENTAL HEALTH TO VERSION WAS PASSED WITH THE GOAL OF TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM UNDERLYING MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ALL SAFE. THIS BILL THREATENS THE PARTICIPATION. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T JUST ON BAND FIRE ARMS. IT BANS ALL DEADLY WEAPONS. SO FOR EXAMPLE A KITCHEN KNIFE COULD BE A DEADLY WEAPON RIGHT YOU GO INTO YOUR KITCHEN AND YOU PULL OUT A BUTCHER KNIFE THAT'S A DOUBLE WEAPON -- IT COULD BE SO. AND THEN. THE PART OF THE THAT YOU KNOW THE PART THAT THE EMPHASIS THE PROFFERED AMENDMENT MADE A LOT OF SENSE IT WOULD BE. WHILE SOMEONE WAS ON DIVERSION THEY WOULD GIVE UP THEIR WEAPONS. BUT IN THIS SCENARIO UNDER THE WAY THAT AB ELEVEN TWENTY ONE IS WRITTEN RIGHT NOW. IT IS A PERMANENT BAN. UNLESS YOU GO BACK TO THE JUDGE. AND THE JUDGE THEN IS FACED WITH THE THE MAKING A DECISION. WELL THIS PERSON HAS SOUTH SOUTH FULLY COMPLETED DIVERSION BUT THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS. AM I GOING TO BE THE JUDGE TO RETURN THEIR GUN. AM I GOING TO BE THE JUDGE TO LIFT THE BAN ON DEADLY WEAPONS. SO ONCE THAT HAPPENS YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE IN MANY PLACES A BARK TO PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND FOR THOSE REASONS FOR RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE LACKEY IT LOOKS LIKE. CAN THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS BAUER-KAHAN. CAN YOU JUST -- TALK ABOUT THE POINT THAT WAS RAISED THAT KITCHEN KNIVES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE USED AS IT IS IT NARROWLY FOCUSED ON FIREARMS OR IS IT DEADLY WEAPONS IN GENERAL AND CAN YOU JUST. YES THANK YOU I AM SO ONE OF THINGS I DO WANT TO SAY AND RESPECT AND WHAT IF THE I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL -- GIVEN THE PRESSURE FOR TIME AND SOME COMPLICATIONS I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT BOTH LA COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY RD. THIS IS THEIR PRACTICE -- AND SO ONE OF THE COMPLICATING FACTORS AS WE NEED TO ENSURE WE WRITE A BILL THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CONTINUE THE PRACTICES THAT THEY SEE FIT -- AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH IN THE BILL WHICH I THINK WE ALL AGREE ON I THINK I CAN SAY BUT MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SPEAK -- SO -- SO WE ARE WORKING ON CONTINUE AMENDMENTS ONE OF WHICH IS WE DON'T INTEND FOR THIS TO BE A LIFETIME BAN THE OTHER I'M IS THAT IT IS INTENDED TO BE ON FOCUSED ON FIRE ARMS AND IF IT WERE TO INCLUDE SUCH OTHER WEAPONS THAT'S AN AMENDMENT I WOULD HAPPILY. TAKE IF IT INCLUDES KITCHEN KNIVES OKAY THANKS ALL THAT FOR THE MR QUIRK. I WISH SHE'D TAKEN THE CHAIRS MAN MEANT BUT I'LL VOTE FOR TODAY BUT TAP PLEASE. I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. YOU ARE MY SEAT MAY -- AS THE MOTION BEEN SECONDED. OKAY YES I WAS WORKING KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME AND I. S. AND OUR OWN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BILL GOING FORWARD AS I HAVE DISCUSSED WITH THE CHAIR. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. AND I BELIEVE MR LACKEY SAID. MISS WICKS. ADDRESS THIS POINT. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE. SO I THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING THAT -- OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE FROM ALL SORTS OF GUN VIOLENCE AND LIKE I SAID WE HAVE TO COUNTIES IN THIS LARGE COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT ALREADY DO THIS AND I THINK IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE FOR US TO EXTEND IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CONTINUALLY. TO GET A BILL THAT WE ARE ALL COMFORTABLE WITHIN IT WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THAT. NIGHT AND THE CHURCH RECOMMEND I TAKE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND YOU MISTER QUIRK SITS TO THE LEFT OF YOU. AND I SIT IN FRONT OF YOU YES SIR.

AND AS YOU KNOW AS YOU CAN READ I'M PRESENTING AB. FOURTEEN FIFTY THIS BILL CALLS ON THE COUNTIES BY TWENTY THIRTY TO FILE REQUIRED PAPERWORK. FOR SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE ELECTRONICALLY. THESE FORMS ARE ALREADY MANDATED BY LAW BUT THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THE FORM TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE AS ELECTRONIC VERSIONS. WITH QUICK INACCURATE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CHILD WELFARE SERVICES. THE CLAIMS THAT WOULD REMAIN ON THE DATABASE WOULD BE THOSE REPORTS THAT WERE SUBSTANTIATED EMPHASIZE THAT. WE'RE SUBSTANTIATE REPORTS WOULD NOT INCLUDE THOSE THAT WERE NOT. THIS ACTUAL ENSURE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES. AND COUNTY DA OFFICES AREN'T BECAUSE SECURITY CATION WHEN INVESTIGATING CLAIMS OF CHILD ABUSE.

A FRACTURE IN HIS SKULL. ACCOUNT WAS OTHER INJURES WERE FOUND IN HIS BODY. THIS HORRIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE IS WHEN THAT HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN. ESPECIALLY AMONGST RURAL REGIONS. WITH MANY CHILDREN MOVING IN AND OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. CHILDREN IN THESE SITUATIONS DO NOT HAVE TO BE ALONE. LA COUNTY IS CREATED AN ONLINE DATABASE CALL THE SCARS. TO SPEED UP THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS THIS ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WILL ENSURE THE TIMELY TRANSFERRING. OF INFORMATION ACROSS STATE AGENCIES. THAT'S MANDATED PAPER FORM. HAS BEEN IN STATUTE FOR MANY YEARS. THIS BILL AB FORTY FIFTY UPDATES THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION MORE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY BY UTILIZING TODAY'S TECHNOLOGIES. THE BILL REQUIRES THE COUNTIES LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CHILD WHERE FOR WELFARE AGENCIES TO DO THEIR DO JAIL DILIGENCE WHEN REPORTING CASES OF ALLEGED ABUSE.

THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING HI MY NAME IS EMILY CROWNS I AM THE COUSIN OF GABLE FERNANDES UM AND THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS. TO PLEASE THE ABOUT THE A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY LAW FOR CABLES LAW. TO CONSIDER IT DEEPLY. FOR WHAT HE SUFFERED WHAT HE WENT THROUGH. IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME RIGHT NOW -- I JUST FEEL THAT YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A BETTER COMMUNICATION TO AGENCIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THINGS THAT ARE IN PLACE. FOR THESE CHILDREN THAT NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE AND FOR THE CHILDREN THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH ABUSE AND NOBODY'S LISTENING TO THEM. I MEAN IT IT WOULD HELP A LOT YOU KNOW I MEAN. IT'S JUST. IT'S BEEN A HARD SIX YEARS TO GET THROUGH. AND WE'RE JUST HOPING THAT SOMETHING CAN FINALLY BE DONE IN THAT. YOU KNOW YOU GUYS WOULD REALLY DEEPLY CONSIDER THIS. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M SORRY ANY OPPOSITION. WOULD YOU MIND [inaudible] OR IF. GOOD EVENING KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO START BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE TRAGEDY OF THE DEATH OF GABRIEL FERNANDEZ -- IT WAS A TRAGIC EVENT -- AND I THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND ALL OF US NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BETTER PROTECT OUR CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE THAT THAT IS A GOAL THAT WE CERTAINLY ALL SHARE -- THAT SAID -- THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN AB FOURTEEN FIFTY WOULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED GABRIEL'S DEATH WHAT HAPPENED AFTER ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE HAD BEEN INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED TO BE UNFOUNDED. AND HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE THEY ALREADY HAD AN ONLINE DATABASE SUCH AS WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY PROPOSES CHANGES THAT WOULD PUT ALL CALIFORNIANS AT RISK OF HAVING CHILD ABUSE IS ALLEGATIONS AGAINST THEM. ENTERED INTO A DATABASE WITH LITTLE OR NO OVERSIGHT AS TO HOW THE INFORMATION CAN BE ACCESSED ARE USED. AND WITH UNDEFINED STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE REMOVAL OF INFORMATION I WANT TO NOTE IN PARTICULAR -- THAT ALTHOUGH THE BILL SAYS THAT ONLY SUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS WILL REMAIN ON ON THE IN THE DATABASE FOR OUR HOUSE SUBSTANTIATED WOULD BE DETERMINED. THE CREATION OF A GOVERNMENT DATABASE TO COLLECT UNTESTED ACCUSATIONS IF IT IS TO BE DONE AT ALL. REQUIRES THE UTMOST CARE IN SETTING STANDARDS AS TO HOW THE INFORMATION COMES TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DATABASE. HOW THE INFORMATION MAY BE USED WHEN IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE RETAINED AND WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE FOR CHALLENGING THE INCLUSION OF THE INFORMATION? WE'VE SEEN THE TYPES OF ABUSES THAT OCCURED WHEN SUCH STANDARDS ARE NOT EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY LAID OUT. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH THE STATEWIDE CHILD ABUSE CENTRAL INDEX WHICH FOR MANY YEARS INCLUDED THE NAMES OF MANY WRONGFULLY ACCUSED PEOPLE AND GAVE THEM NO WAY TO GET THEIR NAMES OFF OF THAT LIST. WE'VE ALSO SEEN IT WITH CAL GANG WHICH ALSO KEPT INFORMATION ON PERSONS WHO DID NOT BELONG IN THE SYSTEM AND ALLOW THE INFORMATION TO BE USED IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT AUTHORIZED. YET AB FOURTEEN FIFTY REQUIRES EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO SET UP SUCH A DATABASE. AND FOR THE MOST PART LETS THEM SET THEIR OWN STANDARDS AS TO HOW THEY WILL OPERATE. THE POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE AND INDEED THE LIKELIHOOD OF ABUSE IS CLEAR. WE ASK YOU TO PROTECT THE CAT RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BY VOTING NO ON THIS BILL WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY -- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS REBEKAH. OUR QUE HAN -- MISTER LACKEY CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER YOU'D BE WILLING. TO HAVE. AMEND THE BILL TO INCLUDE ANY SORT OF HAM ANY OF THE THINGS THAT THE ACLU HAS MENTIONED ABOUT. GIVING GUIDELINES TO THE COUNTIES AS THEY MOVE FORWARD. CERTAINLY WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK WITH. WITH MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT GUIDELINES TO PROTECT THE CONCERNS YOU JUST VOICED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THE CLOSENESS LACKEY. I JUST ASKED THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD BE THOUGHTFUL AND REALIZE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE NOT JUST PROTECT CHILDREN. BY BRINGING THIS COMMUNICATION COMMUNICATION IS WHERE THE BREAKDOWN IS HAPPENING ON THESE -- THESE TRAGIC CIRCUMSTANCES AND WE JUST WANT TO FACILITATE BY USING TECHNOLOGY. AND ALLOWING THE COOPERATION BETWEEN WHEN WHEN YOU'RE BEING WATCHED YOU'RE ALWAYS BETTER. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FACILITATE MISCOMMUNICATION AND FAIR. INTERACTION BETWEEN THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING CHILDREN. THANK YOU. AND I MEAN IT IT. LET ME START WITH MAKING SURE I KNOW. DO YOU DO PROPONENTS BROUGHT SOME CARDS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HIM SUBMITTED. IF YOU DON'T MIND. FOR THE RECORD SIR TO BE WE HAVE ALL THAT BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM MR LACKEYS COMMUNITY LAWYER FROM YOUR COMMUNITY. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE WE DO CARE. IF YOU NEED. TO TRANSLATED -- THAT THAT BE FINE TOO BUT TO MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THAT -- JUST COMMITTEE DOES GENERALLY CARE. AND WITH WITH THAT IN MIND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE GET. TO THE ROOT. OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I I'VE ALWAYS HAD -- ISSUES. WHEN? GOVERNMENT BREAKS DOWN. AND THEN WE TRY TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT MAY NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS. FIXING IT. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS. IN THIS CASE IT WAS REPORTED. AND IGNORED OR NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY [inaudible] BY. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN. YOUR COMMUNITY THAT SHOULD OF AND WEATHER IS A DATABASE OR NOT I'M NOT SURE WOULD HAVE. IT WOULD HAVE HELPED IF IF. THE INFORMATION IS GIVEN. TO OF THE APPROPRIATE WAS SOCIAL WORKERS. OR IS LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT IS ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- WE ALL KNOW. PERSONALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE COLLEAGUES THAT. HAVE BEEN REPORTED FOR THAT AND AND THEY ACTED SWIFTLY. LIKE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AN EIGHT DID WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO [inaudible] AND OF HOPEFULLY IT ALL WORKS OUT FOR EVERYONE. AND PROTECTING CHILDREN -- SEEMS LIKE. THE HORRENDOUS THINGS THAT -- THAT WERE HAPPENING TO THIS YOUNG MAN IS -- UNCONSCIONABLE AND I A MY REAL CONCERN IS HOW DO YOU FIX. THAT SYSTEM WHERE IN ONE PART OF JUST OF THE STATE. THEY ACTED REALLY QUICKLY. AND IN ANOTHER PART OF STATE. SOME AGAIN DO ANYTHING AND AND THE CONCERNS OF THE ACLU IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- THAT. THESE DATABASES DON'T TURN INTO SOMETHING. THAT I DON'T THINK YOU WANT. RIGHT WHERE WERE YOU TRYING TO GET [inaudible] TO AND I'M I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY [inaudible] TWO TO SATISFY. THE ACLU IS CONCERNED. BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT -- THIS IS EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW FROM THE DOJ. AND AND OTHERS DOES LA COUNTY WORK WELL WHAT IS IT WORK BETTER THAN. WHY DIDN'T WORK IN YOUR AREA BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE PARTLY COUNTER? WHY DIDN'T WORK THERE IN A MAY WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH IS A REAL CONCERN IT'S WORKING THERE NOW? RIGHT I I APPRECIATE YOU MADE SURE OF WORKING THERE NOW MR LACKEY -- AND SO OF I ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS AND WE DON'T CREATE REDUNDANT SYSTEMS. THAT REALLY DOESN'T. ADDRESS WHAT'S GOING ON I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION BUT I DON'T KNOW. IF IT IF IT WILL IF IT WILL HELP. FOR IF I CAN GET THE ACLU. TO TO ALSO WORK WITH US. TO TO ENSURE THAT WHEN SOMETHING'S WORK WHEN SOMETHING'S REPORTED. THAT IT. GETS TO WHAT YOU WANT MAKING SURE WE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. AND HOPEFULLY USING EXISTING DATABASE OR THE ONE IN THE COUNTY. BUT MORE IMPORTANT IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHY IS WORKING NOW. AS A AS OPPOSED TO THEN HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN BUT WE HAVE NOW -- BUT THAT MAY BE MEAN. NOT VOTING FOR IT NOW BUT ASKING FOR RECONSIDERATION AND GIVING ME [inaudible] AND YOU. THE FAMILY AND THE COMMITTEE. TO WORK ON THIS ALL AWAY. TO THE END OF THE YEAR. TO HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH SOMETHING. THAT TRULY MAKES THAT TRULY WILL. WE'LL GET THIS DONE. AND AND I TRULY MEAN THAT I MEAN I FELT. I FEEL EVERYTHING THAT THEY SAID. AND I TRULY WANT TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND AND I KNOW YOU'VE TRIED THIS. ONCE BEFORE AND I THINK WHAT WE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT THE WRONG THING. AND WE MAY NEED TO GET. TO THE CENTER OF IT AND SO I AM GOING TO ASK. FOR THE COMMITTEE TO TO TO VOTE NO I KNOW. SOME OR HAVE SOME HARD TIME IF THEY WANT TO DO THAT BUT ALSO MUCH AS FOR RECONSIDERATION. SO THAT I CAN WORK WITH YOU AND I CAN MAKE PERSONAL COMMITMENT TO YOU. THAT WE COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTION. THAT IS A TRUE SOLUTION. TO RESOLVING THAT SO THAT WE LOWER. AND HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE. AT THIS EVER HAPPENS AGAIN. TO ANY OF THESE FAMILIES NOW IN YOUR COMMUNITY BUT IN MINE. THE CITY HERE NOW. SO WITH THAT THE CHURCH FRONT REGRETTABLY -- RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE.
