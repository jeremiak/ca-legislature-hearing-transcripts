LEGISLATION IN CALIFORNIA. SO

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:21.618
IN OUR STATE LOBBYING FIRMS AND

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:23.153
INTEREST GROUPS HIRING THAT

SEPTEMBER WHICH OF COURSE

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.136
INCLUDES THE END OF SESSION.

00:55:40.203 --> 00:55:42.238

LITTLE YOUR SPENT- TO INFLUENCE

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.082
LEGISLATION. BUT THE

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:52.615
INTERESTING THING IS THE

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.884
DISCLOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:57.487

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:58.922
CONTRACTS THAT DID NOT OCCUR

00:55:58.988 --> 00:55:59.956
UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:01.124
ACTUALLY ALREADY DECIDED WHICH

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:02.759
BILLS TO PASS OR DEFEAT AND IN

00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:06.096

DECIDED WHICH BILLS TO SIGN OR

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:09.232

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:10.800
TO PROVIDE ANY USEFUL REAL

00:56:10.867 --> 00:56:13.369

00:56:15.939 --> 00:56:16.439
WHEN THAT WHILE THE FATE OF

00:56:16.506 --> 00:56:18.675
LEGISLATION IS DECIDED. TO

00:56:18.742 --> 00:56:19.309
NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE IN THE

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:22.278
UNION. VIED FOR MONTHLY

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:24.147

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:28.084
REPORTING. I HADN'T IT'S MY

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.385
STRONG FEELING THAT CALIFORNIA

NEEDS TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:32.188

LOBBYING IMPACTING PUBLIC

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.661
POLICY. I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN

00:56:38.728 --> 00:56:41.131
IN SITUATIONS WHERE- FOLKS OR

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.665
SOMETHING COMING IN IN SUPPORT

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.334
OR OPPOSITION TO OUR OWN BILLS.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.802
WE HAVE AN AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO

ONE WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF OUR

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:04.287
BROADER GOAL OF TRYING TO DO

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:05.455
NOTHING THAT WE WOULD THAT

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:07.123
WOULD BE THAT THAT THEY WOULD

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.391
CAUSE A LOT OF UNNECESSARY

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.459
PAPERWORK WITHOUT PROVIDING THE

00:57:09.526 --> 00:57:11.261

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:14.931
IMPORTANT THING. THE BILL'S

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.299
GOING TO REQUIRE REPORTING FOR

00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:17.767

SIXTY DAYS OF SESSION. IT WILL

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:23.306
ALSO REQUIRE SUPPLEMENTAL

BEGIN LOBBYING. UNDER THE BILL

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:33.883
QUARTERLY REPORTS SO WE'RE

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.685

THE QUARTERLY REPORT

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.723
REQUIREMENTS. SO THOSE

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:41.624

INFLUENCES LAWS BEING MADE. ON

00:57:56.372 --> 00:57:57.273
