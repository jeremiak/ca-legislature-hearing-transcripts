A COUPLE MORE MEMBERS JOIN US I'M AT THIS TIME I AM GOING TO PASS OVER THE GAVEL TO OUR VICE CHAIR SENATOR A CHOI BOGUE. WHO WILL FACILITATE THE MEETING WHILE I GO UP AND PRESENT. WARNING CENTER LEE MARTIN A PRESENT YOUR BELL SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX PRESENTS THE CONTINUATION OF AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW ARE HOW WELL OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE SERVING COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM HEALTHY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE LOW BANK FEES ARE A VOTE BANK THE ACCOUNTS AND MORTGAGES OR SMALL BUSINESS LOANS WITH FAIR RATES IS A POSITIVE THING FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS. BUT IN TOO MANY PLACES ACROSS THE STATE ESPECIALLY IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE CONSTITUENTS DO NOT ENJOY THE SAME LEVEL OF ACCESS. AS WEALTHIER OR MORE DENSELY POPULATED AREAS BACK IN THE NINETEEN SEVEN SEVENTIES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRY TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES BY PASSING THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT ALSO KNOWN AS C. R. EIGHT WHICH ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO EVALUATE HOW WELL BANKS ARE MEETING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES. AND NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY DO THIS. NOW WE KNOW THAT C. R. A. DID NOT SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS IN OUR FINANCE. SERVE AND THIS IS EVE FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHICH THEY DO BUSINESS. BUT AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE C. R. A. HAS EXPANDED ACCESS TO MORTGAGES AND SMALL BUSINESS LENDING AND LOWER INCOME AREAS AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CURRENTLY LOOKS AT LOOKS TO MODERNIZE THE PROGRAM'S REGULATIONS I HOPE THAT THE CRA CAN BECOME EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING THE INTENDED OUTCOMES OF HELPING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. ONE OF THE SHORTFALLS OF THE FEDERAL YEAH A HER C. R. A. HOWEVER IS THAT IT ONLY COVERS BANKS THIS MAY HAVE BEEN REASONABLE IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN IT DOMINATED THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF COUNCIL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE NOT EVEN ALLOCATED ON HOW WELL THEY ARE STARVING UNDERSERVED THESE. INCREDIBLE AND IT MORTGAGE COMPANIES AND A GROWING POPPY OF FINTECH LENDERS. CAN I SEEN THIS GAP SEVERAL STATES HAVE ENACTED THEIR OWN CRA LAWS IN AN EFFORT TO ENCOURAGE A BROADER SECTION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL COMMUNITIES. PIECE FOR A SUMMARIZE WHAT THE BILL DOES I WANT TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY ONE OF MY MOTIVATIONS FOR STARTING THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF US ARE FAMILIAR WITH WE UNDERSTAND THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES OF THAT GAP WHETHER IT BE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE THE MONEY FOR A DOWN PAYMENT ON A HOUSE OR MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGHER STUDENT LOAN DEBT OR HIGH INTEREST CREDIT CARD. BUT THERE IS ALSO A RACIAL TRUST GAP WHEN IT COMES TO INTERFACING WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND THE TRUST GAP RESULTS FROM DECADES OF DISCRIMINATION. DECADES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WALKING INTO BANKS AND HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS AND BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY. THAN WHITE CUSTOMERS. DECADES OF BEING OFFERED SUB STANDARD PRODUCTS IF ANY AT ALL. AND THOSE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE NOT JUST OUR OWN GENERATION BUT ALSO THE GENERATIONS THAT CAME BEFORE US ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE. SHAPES OUR PERCEPTIONS TODAY. THE FEDERAL CRA DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR RACE AND ETHNICITY IN ITS EVALUATION OF BANKS PERFORMANCES. INSTEAD IT LOOKS AT ONLY. IT LOOKS ONLY AT INCOME LEVELS. BUT WE KNOW THAT INCOME ALONE DOES NOT EXPLAIN DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES. EVEN AS OUR COMMUNITY HAS MADE PROGRESS IN NEARING THE WAGE GAP THE GAP. IN HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE AMERICANS IS NOW THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AS I STATED I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST DO MORE IN FIGHTING TO REVERSE SOME OF THIS HISTORY THIS BILL LAYS THE FOUNDATION. FOR OUR STATE REGULATOR TO BEGIN EVEN ATTY WEEDING OUR STATE LICENSE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR HOW WELL THEY ARE SERVING THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF CALIFORNIA THE BILL DOES THREE MAIN THINGS FIRST IT REQUIRES A STATE REGULATOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION TO ANALYZE MORTGAGE LENDING DATA TO EXCESS HOW WELL. ITS LICENSEES ARE SERVING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SECOND IT REQUIRES THAT THE REGULATOR COLLABORATE WITH OTHER REGULATORS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED STATE C. R. A. PROGRAMS THAT IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES IN ADMINISTERING THOSE LAWS. THIRD IT REQUIRES THE REGULATOR TO EVALUATE ITS AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURES TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR BROADENING THE SCOPE OF EXISTING PROGRAM ACCESS HOW WELL LICENSEES ARE MEETING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES. THE FINANCIAL SERVICES NEED OF UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THIS BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT TO PUBLISH THE ANALYSIS REQUIRED BY THE BILL ON THE WEBSITE WHICH CAN BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE POLICY DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS TOPIC. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME FOR OUR STATE TO ADD THIS IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF EQUITY AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO THE WAY WE OVERSEE THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND I HOPE THAT THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT START TO MORE CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER TO COLLECTIVELY REACH THOSE OBJECTIVES IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE WILL WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO COMMONLY REACH THE- DOES THAT I KNOW. OUR IMPORT. ASPEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER LEE MANUEL MOVE ON ANY FOR AT WANTING TO TELL. FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM BOTH GONZALEZ OF THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING IN PERSON. I THANK YOU SENATOR TROUBLING THANK YOU SENATOR LIMON FAIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL- AS WELL AS ALL OF YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TODAY. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS PAULINE EVAN SIDE IS PRETTY THOROUGH I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION CRC IS A STATEWIDE COALITION OF OVER THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. FOR GENERATIONS BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR BY PARK HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM BANKING I HAVE HAD- WEALTH EXTRACTED BY N. STREET UNSCRUPULOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THIS IS A RESULT OF REDLINING BANKS FAIL TO SERVE ALL COMMUNITY EXCLUDING MAJORITY MINORITY NEIGHBORHOODS FROM THEIR BRANCH FOOTPRINT. EXT FINANCIAL PRODUCTS LIKE PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS FAILING TO MAKE PPP LOANS OR OTHER SMALL BUSINESS LOANS TO BUY PARKS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND FINANCING LOANS TO CORPORATE LANDLORDS THAT DISPLACED TENANTS. OFTEN THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE SAME AREAS THAT PREVIOUS REDLINING MAPS SHOWED US WERE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE BANKS REFUSED TO MAKE LOANS TO BUY POT. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS SERIAL HARM TO BUY POT COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS WHILE WHITE CALIFORNIANS WERE BUYING HOUSES THAT THEY COULD PASS ON TO THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. BUILDING INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH WE WERE BEING DENIED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE RENTERS AND MORE LIKELY TO BE HARMED BY DISPLACEMENT OFTEN BY THE SAME FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BOB WHO FLIPPED. THERE THE MEDIAN WEALTH GAP BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE FAMILIES IS TWELVE CENTS PER ONE DOLLAR WHITE WEALTH WELL THE GAP BETWEEN THAT NAY AND WHITE FAMILIES AND TWENTY ONE CENTS PER ONE DOLLAR OF WHITE WEALTH. ANGELA GLOVER BLACKLEG WELLS OF HELPING POLICE STATED IN A NEW YORK TIMES OP ED QUOTE BANKS HAVE BEEN UNDER WRITERS OF AMERICAN RACISM NO INDUSTRY HAS PLAYED A BIGGER OR MORE AND DURING ROLE IN BLACK OPPRESSION EXPLOITATION AND EXCLUSION SHE GOES ON TO SAY FIRST THEY MUST APOLOGIZE FOR THE COUPLE CULPABILITY FOR INCOME CITY INSTRUCTIONAL RACISM NEXT THEY MUST COMMIT TO SERVING BLACK PEOPLE AS THEY DO WHITES. THEN THE INDUSTRY CAN START TO CLOSE THE WEALTH GAP REPAIR THE HARMS AND SERVE AS A MODEL FOR A NATION STRUGGLING TO RECKON WITH RACISM AT SEVENTY SIX ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK THAT DIRECTS THE FPI TO VALIDATE THE MORTGAGE LENDING OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WE ASK THAT THIS ASSESSMENT ALSO INCLUDES SMALL BUSINESS LENDING CONSUMER LENDING AND CLIMATE IMPACTS TO SEE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE PARTICIPATING IN HARM TO FORMALLY READ COMMUNITIES AND BUY POT PEOPLE. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE REQUIREMENTS THE DF EVALUATE OF THORGY TO ASSESS WHETHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE ADEQUATELY SERVING COMMUNITIES AND COMPLYING WITH ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS WE DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF SLOW ROLLING A CORRECTION FOR GENERATIONS OF HARM BY PUCK THAT PLEASE ARE STRUGGLING EVERY DAY TO HOLD ON WE ARE SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND THIS IS ALL AS WE WILL NOW- ESTABLISH QUORUM- MISTER CONSULTANT PLEASE- SEVERAL. WELL KNOWN HERE WELL KNOWN HERE A CHILL ABOUT HERE AKOBO HERE BRADFORD. BRADFORD HERE CABALLERO ALLEY YOUR DAILY HERE THEY'RE ALSO WESO MAN MAN HERE PORTANTINO YOU HAVE A QUORUM. CORN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM OUR NEED WITNESS OUR SECOND LEAD WITH THIS W. GORE MAN OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE BANKING AND FINANCE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEBORAH KERR MAN PRESIDENT CEO OF THE GREEN LINE INSTITUTE. THE GREENING INSTITUTE IS A STATE AND NATIONAL POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZING AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION WORKING TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND EMPOWERMENT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN INCREASING EQUITY IN OUR FINANCIAL INST FINANCIAL SYSTEM FOR STATE LICENSE HOME LENDERS AND UNDERSTANDING THE CREDIT NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THESE LENDERS OPERATE WE FEEL THIS ANALYSIS IS URGENTLY NEEDED AS TRADITIONAL BANKS INCREASINGLY. CONSOLIDATE AND CLOSE BRANCHES CREATING A LENDING VACUUM THAT IS EASILY FILLED BY UNREGULATED STATE LICENSED LENDERS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS DO NOT HAVE THE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING WHETHER STATE LICENSED LENDERS ARE MEETING THE FINANCIAL SERVICES. NEEDS OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX CRITICAL COLLECTING THE INFORMATION WE NEED FOR DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK FOR CALIFORNIA. OUR RESEARCH WE HAVE FOUND THAT NON BANK LENDERS HAVE A GREATER PRESENCE IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THAN TRADITIONAL BANKS. THIS COULD BE CONCERNING BECAUSE- THESE GROUPS ARE HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO PREDATORY LENDING AND BECAUSE NON BANK LENDERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. THE LEGAL OBLIGATION TO MEET THE CREDIT NEEDS OF LOW INCOME MODERATE LOW INCOME AND MODERATE POTTER BORROW SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY REQUIRED OF TRADITIONAL BANKS DOES NOT APPLY THIS ANALYSIS WILL HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF CONCERN. THE LEGACY OF REDLINING HAS RESULTED IN NEIGHBORS NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NOT ONLY LACKS ADEQUATE INVESTMENT BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BUT ALSO COMMONLY BEAR DISPROPORTIONATE ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS RESULTING IN INCREASED VULNERABILITIES TO CLIMATE CHANGE. A RECENT STUDY BY MARK THAT FOUND THAT NATIONALLY PEOPLE OF COLOR WILL MORE LIKELY BE DENIED A MORTGAGE THAN THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS DESPITE HAVING SIMILAR DEBT TO INCOME RATIOS. THIS DISPARITY IS DRIVEN BY ALGORITHMS USED BY NON BANK LENDERS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT INFORMATION ABOUT COMMUNITIES OF COLORS. HOME LENDERS HAVE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE. SAFE HOME LOANS THAT INCREASE FAMILY WEALTH AND REDUCE THE WIDENING RACIAL WEALTH GAP ADDITIONALLY IT RESEARCH BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SEPARATE CISCO OF WHICH I SERVE ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND OTHERS ALSO SHOWS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS A RISK MULTIPLIER. THAT EXACERBATES RACIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. SHOULD SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX ADVANCED TODAY THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE WOULD APPRECIATE A PROVISION INCLUDE INCORPORATING A GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS MORTGAGE LENDING ACTIVITIES OVERLAID WITH THE CAL RECYCLE THE COLUMBINA SCREEN. IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES WHERE CRA QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS CAN ADDRESS COMMUNITY CREDIT NEEDS WHILE REDUCING POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENT A BURNING COMMITTEE WORK TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS AND RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR IT I VOTE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU.

CENTERMAN I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANNA MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I IN A PREVIOUS LIFE I ACTUALLY WROTE QUITE A BIT ABOUT THE FEDERAL CRLA I IN PARTICULAR WITH. RESPECT TO THE CLAIM THAT CRA SOMEHOW BECAUSE THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT. SUBPRIME MORTGAGE THIS AND- THE SHORT VERSION OF MY RESPONSE TO THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT. THOSE WHO ARE CLAIMING SHE OR HE HAD A ROLE WERE PURPOSELY MISCONSTRUING THE ROLE OF CRA- SO I GUESS I'D SAY THIS I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTION OF THIS I APPRECIATE THIS BILL VERY MUCH- YOU KNOW WEALTH BUILDING IS SO IMPORTANT AS COUNTRY AS I THINK THE AUTHORS POINT ENTER COMMENTS- WE'VE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE HISTORY OF REDLINING OF DENYING ACCESS TO CREDIT- AND WHILE. A LOT OF ECONOMISTS SIT BACK IN THEIR IVORY TOWERS AND POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY. INVESTING IN A FOUR ONE K. OR IN SOME KIND OF A MUTUAL FUND- THE REALITY IN AMERICA. CALIFORNIA IN ORANGE COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT IS THAT OFF THEIR HOME. THAT HAVE HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS THE NUMBER ONE PATHWAY TO WEALTH BUILDING- AND THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY YOU CAN TALK TO SOMEBODY. BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS ECONOMISTS ABOUT THAT. BUT THE FACT IS HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE SINGLE. MOST EFFECTIVE AND MOST USED PATHWAY TO WEALTH BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES. AND UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY HOUSEHOLDS PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. HAVE BEEN DENIED THAT ACCESS TO CREDIT. NOW THAT BEING SAID I DO THINK THERE A LOT OF QUESTIONS OF. PECTIN ARRAY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. REALITY IS A LOT OF THING PEOPLE THINK IT HASN'T WORKED AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT ONLY COVERS DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. SO BANK OF AMERICA WHICH IS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY HAS A LOT OF ACTIVITIES IT COVERS ONLY A SMALL PORTION THAT COMMITTEES IT ONLY APPLIES TO THE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN WHICH THEY HAVE. ACTUAL BRANCHES- SO THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HERE A HEALTH ACTIVIST IT THERE'S ALSO SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE SHOULD APPLY AT THE STATE LEVEL. NOW THE REALITY IS THAT DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS. HIGHLY REGULATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE. MEANWHILE YOU HAVE A LOT OF NON BANK FINANCE COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGING ALLOW THE SAME ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THESE TYPES OF- REGULATIONS- SO I THINK THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT. THE SCOPE OF COVERAGE WHICH THE STATE'S YEAR A REQUIREMENT LOOK LIKE- SHOULD IT APPLY TO. DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS SHOULD EXTEND THAT ARE WE OVER% BURDENING DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS OUT WHAT'S THE RIGHT BALANCE I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWERS THESE QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING TO MAKE THIS A STUDY BILL BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A PUBLIC. THE QUESTION. WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS INVOLVED BUT BUT I WANT TO PLOT THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I THINK THE DIRECTION THIS THE- RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM HERE THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF HOUSEHOLDS. THAT STILL IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO OF FIFTY YEARS AFTER SIERRA WAS ALMOST TWO YEARS AFTER SHERRY WAS PASSED. FIFTY YEARS AFTER WE STARTED RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM OF REDLINING THEY'RE STEPPING CANNOT ACCESS TO CREDIT AND MUCH MORE COMPLEX FINANCIAL BERMAN SO. UNDERSTANDING WHAT THAT PROBLEM IS WHAT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE IS IMPORTANT STEP HERE SO- I APPLAUD THIS BILL. IN I WOULD. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU COMING THAT IT'S OR COMMENTS- SAID DELHI WILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO I REALLY THE BILL BUT I HAVE I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND LOOK I'VE BEEN ON THE COMMITTEE SINCE I CAME TO THE SENATE WAS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY BEYOND BANKING AND- I LEARNED A LOT I'M REALLY BEEN EDUCATED AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT. OF THE WHAT WE SEEM CREDIT LENDING AND M. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND COMMUNITIES ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BUT THAT THE ONE THING LACKING IN THIS BILL. THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE PART OF. THIS BILL IS THE- YOU KNOW THAT THE- DATA. INCLUDED TO THE CREDIT RISK IF YOU INCLUDE THE CREDIT RISKS THEN YOU CAN pWHAT THE LENDERS ARE ARE DOING. AND SO I'M I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL I'M ONLY OFF THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT HAS TO BE IN YOUR IF WE DON'T. IF WE DON'T PUT THAT IN HERE WE DON'T ACTUALLY GET A ACCURATE DATA WHAT WHAT THE RISK IS BECAUSE RISK THERE IS A RISK WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU ONLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THAT'S CREDIT SCORE IS SO YOU CAN THEN BALANCE OUT AND ACTUALLY FOCUS IN ON WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SO. IF THAT WAS IN THIS BILL. THEY CAN BE. ON BUT IT NEEDS TO BE IN BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE. COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES REGMI. COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I'LL ACTUALLY RESPOND JUST TO THE CREDIT RISK WHICH ALSO INCLUDES YOU KNOW FIGHT GO SCORES AND OTHER SCORES AND I THINK. IT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT DOESN'T REQUIRE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE THE ALGORITHMS AND THE MODELS IN THE REGRESSIONS AND ASK FOR D. F. P. I. SO IT ASKED FOR THE- ENTITY THAT OVERSEES IS. TO CREATE THE ANALYSIS AND THAT ANALYSIS WILL ACCOUNT FOR THIS THIS IS AN I GOT YOU BILL THERE IS NO REGULATION HERE. TERMS UNDERSTANDING WHERE OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INVESTING MONEY AND YOU KNOW. IT IT'S- IN. WE HAVE A- TERMS OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BUT A SIMPLE ALSO REPRESENT SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I CAN WENT TO. IS AND I. FIND IT CALIFORNIA AND- AT. TO K. TO. SO TO BE CLEAR IT WILL BE INCLUDED THIS IS AN I GOT YOU WE WILL BETTER UNDERSTAND WHEN D. F. P. I. IS. MAKES THE ANALYSIS AND THEY WILL OF COURSE USE THAT AND OTHER- INDICATORS TO BETTER ASSESS THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE AND I GOT YOU. AND THIS IS REALLY JUST COLLECTING INFORMATION AND THE REASON IT'S NOT THERE IS BECAUSE THAT REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS ACTUALLY NOT. IN THE BILL THAT'S A D. F. P. I. ISSUE. IT IS I JUST ONE OF ASK THE RIGHT QUESTION YOU'RE GONNA GET AN ANSWER THAT YOU DON'T WANT AND I WANT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ASKING THE QUESTION IN A WAY THAT IT GETS THAT WE GET THE GOOD DATA YEAH AND IN PAIN WITH YOU ON THAT AND I HAVE RULE COMMUNITIES ALL THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M GETTING GOOD DATA SO THAT WE CAN GO IN AND ACTUALLY TAKE THE INFORMATION AND WORK WITH IT YEAH AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT PAGE FIVE IN THE ANALYSIS- ABOUT WAS SOMEWHERE AROUND NINE THIRTY AM YOU WILL SEE THAT IT SPEAKS MORE. INDICATORS THAT BE AT HOUSTON HOW DF PI- WILL RUN THAT AND SO- IT SORRY I'M SORRY AND THAT'S NOT IN THE BILL IT'S IN SORRY IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE FIVE LINE THIRTY OF THE BILL NOT THE ANALYSIS I APOLOGIZE. THE BILL. IT SPEAKS MORE TO THAT. QUESTION MANTRA SORRY SENATOR RAND YEAH I HAD A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR- IS THE JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOU SAID IS OUR LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT WOULD DIRECT THE ADF PI TO LOOK INTO- CREDIT- IN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS. SO YES AND IN THE BILL YOU'LL SEE THAT IT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS BUT THE BILL DOES SPEAK TO IT AND WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM I MEAN I THINK. THAT THE SOUND IS IMPORTANT AND THIS ISN'T SUPPOSED TO JUST BE LIKE DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT INVEST WE WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY'RE INVESTING WHERE. YOU'RE INVESTING AND THE REASONS AND SO THOSE REASONS ALLOW- FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- WHY THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS. FOR NOT RIGHT IN CERTAIN AREAS AND I THINK THAT THE OTHER PIECE HE- IT. YOU KNOW THERE ARE GROWING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS IN THE MARKET- AND AS HAS BEEN SAID IS SAID AND STATED. YOU KNOW- IT'S NOT JUST DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS FROM BIG BANKS RIGHT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOW GROWING. AND SO I THINK THAT FOR US IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW ARE THEY ALL DOING RIGHT SO LIKE WHAT THE POWER IS A FINTECH COMPANY DOING. HOW IS A CREDIT UNION DOING. THE HELPFUL. OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SAME HERE AREAS WERE WEEK FEEL RIGHT WE COULD STILL INVEST BUT THIS ISN'T A REGULATION BILL THIS IS SIMPLY ASKING FOR INFORMATION AND FOR THE INFORMATION TO BE AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN ACCESS IT PUBLICLY. YET JUST A QUICK FOLLOW UP NOT I MEAN I MEAN I WOULD NOTE THAT THE DA PI ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY MANDATES I THINK THE PRIMARY MANDATE IS TO ENSURE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS SO. ALL OF THIS- THAT YOU'RE ASKING THE STUDIES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF CS IN TOWN IS IN MAINTAINING THAT AT HIGH LEVELS. YES SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE AND I WISH YOU ARE A GOTCHA BECAUSE WE'VE DONE ENOUGH RESEARCH AND WE KNOW THE HISTORY AS THE FIRST WITNESS CLEARLY STATED. BANKS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO. THE RACISM IN THIS COUNTRY THE LACK WEALTH AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES FOUR HUNDRED TWO YEARS IT'S NO SECRET WE KNOW LANCERS SO IT'S- ABOUT TIME WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BUT- AS YOU WELL KNOW I CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HAD- HEARINGS AND ASKED. BANKS A COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT THEIR LANDING- AND TO MINORITIES AND MINORITIES THAT HIT THE SAME INCOME AS WHITE COUNTERPART IN THE STILL COULD GET HOME LOANS IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES SO ALL WE KNOW WHY IT'S HISTORIC HERE IN THIS COUNTRY AND PART OF THE REPARATIONS TASK FORCE ONE OF THINGS WE- EXAMINE A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. WAS THE BANK'S HISTORY IN LENDING TO PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IT'S DEPLORABLE AND WE KNOW ON. AT REDLINING DISCRIMINATION ALL THOSE REASONS SO. I MEAN I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE BUT I THINK WE ALREADY KNOW ANSWERS AND WE WILL WE SHOULD BE PUTTING SOME TEETH IN. THE GETTING THESE INSTITUTIONS TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO I LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING THE BILL. THANK YOU AS SENATOR BRADFORD AND I WILL SAY THAT BOTH OF MY BILLS CHANNEL A LITTLE OF YOUR PAST. CHAIR WORK THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT VERY PUBLICLY SO- IT CERTAINLY IS AN ISSUE AND I THINK WE WANT TO EXPAND THE INFORMATION WE HAVE. AGAIN NOT JUST ON BANKS BUT ALL OF THE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE LICENSED IN THE STATE. PERFECT- ANYTHING ELSE REMEMBERS- I DID JUST WANT TO ECHO- THE COMMENTS- THAT SENATOR DOLLY MADE WITH REGARDS TO YOU AS I WAS LOOKING IN HERE WITH THE ANALYSIS TO COMPARE LICENSEES WITHIN THE SAME PEER GROUP ALONG THE FOLLOWING METRICS YOU HAD OR IT WAS POINTED OUT ONE LOAN APPROVAL RATES BY INCOME AND RACE AND BY RACE AND ETHNICITY TO LOAN COST INCLUDING INTEREST RATES AND CLOSING COSTS BY INCOME AND BY RACE. AND ETHNICITY AND THE MIX OF LOAN TYPES BY INCOME AND BY RACE AND ETHNICITY. AND I THINK THAT- AND I AND I UNDERSTAND SENATOR DAHLE THESE A POINT ABOUT THE FICUS SCORE IS THAT WITH IN THESE- WITHIN THESE- METRICS THAT YOU WERE REQUESTING. CONTACTS IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT THE RISK FACTOR- OF- OF LENDING- TO HAVE AN ACCURATE IN MORE IN DEPTH LOOK INTO- THESE PRACTICES. I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE A COMMENT THOUGH- AND THIS IS WITH REGARDS TO THE FACT THAT. I ACTUALLY WORKED IN REAL ESTATE- VERY CLOSELY WITH THE MORTGAGE- LENDING BANKS IN OUR AREA IN MY REGION- FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS PRIOR TO COMING TO THE SENATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED AND I WORKED WITH ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I AM NOT THE NINE NINE SPANISH SPEAKING NIGHT. I DID SERVE A LOT OF LET YOU KNOW I FAMILIES IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THEM INTO HOME OWNERSHIP BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE CORNERSTONE TO THE AMERICAN DREAM AND BUILDING WEALTH- BY ONE OF THE THINGS I DID WHEN I. PUT ON THE RECORD HERE IS THAT ONE OF THE- FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO BE- HONEST ABOUT IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE MIGRATING TO THE U. S. THAT DO NOT NECESSARILY HAVE FINANCIAL LITERACY AND THIS IS WHY I'M LITERACY. BECAUSE THAT MAKES AN IMPACT IN THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS THAT PEOPLE MAKE WITH REGARDS TO HOW TO PURCHASE A HOME I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH MANY FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. I ACTUALLY FELT COMPELLED TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN INSIDE OF YOU KNOW AT THE TIME YOU KNOW MY LIMITED INSIGHT INTO FINANCIAL. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T YOU DON'T PURCHASE A HOME USING 50% OF YOUR INCOME YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID. 30% BECAUSE YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE MONEY THAT YOU PUT ASIDE. REPAIRS IN THE HOME- IS A FOR THE FOR EMERGENCY SO I GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF MY PERSONAL FINANCIAL AS- TOO MIGHT MAKE MY CLIENTS. AND I FELT THAT BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE WERE NOT AWARE. AND THOSE AND NOT HAVING FINANCIAL LITERACY DOES AFFECT HOW AND WHAT TO DO TO MAKE AND HOW IT AFFECTS YOUR FICUS SCORE IN THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU HAVE IN THE LONG TERM. SO AS WE ARE DEALING WITH PEOPLE OF COLOR ESPECIALLY WITH THE LATINO COMMUNITY THAT I CAN PERSONALLY SPEAK FROM- I REMEMBER WHEN I. THANKS P. TRACKS FROM THE- CAN YOU. WHERE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE- ESPECIALLY THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE LIMITED IN EDUCATION- WE WOULD GO TO THE MAIN TRANSIT PROJECTS TO- BORROW MONEY. OUT LOCALLY FROM THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD MATRIX REPEAT TRACKS NOT FROM BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SO THEY WOULD BE AT RISK OF BEING EXPLOITED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE. COULD CHARGE WHATEVER THAT WAS BUT IT WAS THE NLY WAY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO. TO TO FINANCIAL- CAPITAL SO- THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE UNITED STATES IT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA AND I'M SURE IT GOES THROUGH OUT- THE WORLD. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE SPECIALLY AS WE HAVE MIGRAINES COMING INTO OUR- COUNTRY IS TO MAKE SURE. THAT EVERYONE HAS TO ENSURE LITERACY I WISH IT WAS A REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. I WISH IT WAS A REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE- SPECIALLY AS A FRESHMAN WHEN YOU'RE- MAKING DECISIONS. ON THE LOANS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW. BEING OFF ON. C. ISN'T. TO ECONOMIC. AND EMPOWER. AND WE NEED TO START FOCUSING ON THAT PART SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE THE BEST BEST WISE CHOICES ON THEIR BEHALF SPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR- IMMIGRANTS IN OUR AND PEOPLE FOR MIGRATING TO OUR COUNTRY. JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT THERE BECAUSE I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS- GO AHEAD AND- I REALLY. I'M IN A RURAL AREA HAVE A PERFECT CREDIT SCORE MY FIRST BUSINESS AND IT WAS IT WAS BECAUSE OF WHERE I LIVED RIGHT FRANKLY AND BECAUSE THE MEDIAN INCOME IN MY COMMUNITY WAS LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND. ALL RIGHT AND I WAS TRYING TO BUY I BORROW A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO. THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME I HAD TO GO BOB BARR PRIVATE MONEY WHICH WAS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE. TO FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO START MY FIRST BUSINESS AND SO IT BUT IF. IF THIS BILL AS ENACTED AND WE GOT THE DATA BACK AND I HAD MY SCORE WHICH WAS PERFECT AND BECAUSE OF WHERE I LIVE IS WHY THEY DENIED MY LONG. SO I I'M IF YOU COULD PLEASE PUT THAT IN THERE AND SPELL IT OUT I THINK THIS WILL GIVE US GOOD DEAL. AS I. IN AUBURN VISIT WITH MY FRIEND FROM GUARDIAN THIS THIS WILL THEN SHOW WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING AND I WANT YOU TO. I WANT TO GET THAT DATA BECAUSE IT DOES HAPPEN WE CAN PROVE IT GREAT MAKE THIS A GOTCHA BILL BECAUSE IT HAPPENS SO WE GET THE DATA WE SHOW THAT THERE ARE. INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T GOING TO COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THEY CAN JUST BROADLY LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE AND THE MEDIAN INCOME THAT COMES IN AND THEY DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE OF BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T WANNA GO IN THERE. AND I APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT IN A IN A THINK YOU YOU KNOW- AND CERTAINLY AS YOU KNOW IF THIS. AS IT MOVES FOR. BUT WE CAN ALSO. TELL YOU KNOW WE TALK MORE ABOUT. HOW DF PI WOULD CREATE THAT ANALYSIS AND-SO. IT IS. I THINK. SINCE WE STARTED WE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD. THAT YOUR CREDIT SCORE IS PART OF THE REASON THAT YOU MAY BE. GIVEN OR DENIED A PRODUCT AND SO IT'S NOT TO EXCLUDE THIS. BUT I THINK YOU KNOW FOR ME AS AS I LOOK AT THIS BILL. AND EIGHT IN A HERE YOU KNOW REALLY THAT THE VARIETY OF COMMENTS FROM ALL OF US WHO ARE FROM VERY DIFFERENT PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WE- ALL RECOGNIZE- AND I THINK AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS IS. SOMETHING THAT THAT COMES OUT OF THIS WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS LIMITATIONS AND HOW. THINGS ARE WORKING WE ALL HAVE A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD. IN RELATION TO THIS WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE. LIKE WHAT YOU GET TONIGHT WHY DO YOU GET THIS HOW'S IT GOING. BUT ALSO A THE A THING TO WHAT THE VICE CHAIR HAS MENTIONED. IT CREATES A TRUST WHO YOU LEARN FROM YOU HAVE TO TRUST. YOU OR SOMEONE THAT YOUR CLIENTS TRUSTED TO HELP AND GUIDE THROUGH. AND SO THIS IS PART. AFTER YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT GENERATIONS BEFORE IS NOT GOING TO BANKS. RIGHT AND SO IT'S PART OF A HISTORY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE. AND HOW DO YOU CHANGE A HISTORY WHERE THERE HASN'T BEEN THAT TRUST- YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE. WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUT INFORMATION PUBLICLY THAT SAYS BOTH WHERE IT'S WORKING AND MEET YOU KNOW WHERE IT'S WORKING WHERE IT'S NOT WORKING. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PLACES WHERE IT'S WORKING BETTER AND I WANT TO KNOW WHY. AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW WILL COME IT'S WORKING BETTER THERE WHAT HAPPENED WHICH CHANGED. WHAT DID THE FINANCED INSTITUTIONS DO DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE THE LANDING YOU KNOW AND THE SERVICES TO OUR UNDERREPRESENTED FOLKS AND AGAIN UNDER REPRESENTED FOLKS. IT'S JUST THAT THIS CITY IT'S ALSO RURAL AREAS RIGHT. UNDERREPRESENTED FOLKS IS BETTER BUT I ALSO LEARNED A WEEK. WE'VE KNOWN FOR DECADES. THAT THIS ISN'T WORKING IN SOME COMMUNITIES. AND IT'S STILL NOT WORKING. WHY AFTER DECADES ISN'T THIS WORKING AND SO OF COURSE TO ANSWER THE WHY. OR WILL ALWAYS BE. SO WILL OTHER ELLA RIGHT WE NEED TO ANSWER THE WHY AND SO FOR ME YOU KNOW YOU MOST OF YOU KNOW I STARTED THIS BILL- AND IT WAS TO CREATE A STATE CRA AND WE GOT A LOT OF OPPOSITION FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ST WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A PROGRAM IN THE STATE THAT AUTOMATICALLY DOES THIS AND I THOUGHT. WELL WHY WHY DON'T WE WANT TO CREATE THIS RIGHT- WHAT ARE THE ELEMENTS- ISN'T THAT STOP THIS BUT I ALSO WANT TO DO SOMETHING- THAT MOVES US FORWARD AND HAS THE EVIDENCE I'VE WORKED YOU KNOW WITH THE BANKING YOU KNOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES FOR SOMETIME AND I KNOW THAT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS TO ALSO BRING YOU ALL EVIDENCE- IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOT JUST BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD OR SOUNDS GOOD. SO FOR ME THIS IS PART OF A GREAT PTION OF IF WE HAVE OF RECENT DATA THAT LOOKS AT CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC NOT JUST AT OTHER STATES RIGHT AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND AND MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN WE THEN THE NOTION THAT IT'S JUST BANKS IS- IT. IS A CAT YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE SEE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE USING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THERE'S ONLINE PRODUCTS THERE'S DIFFERENT LENDING PRODUCTS- WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRADITIONAL BANKS COMMUNITY BANKS CREDIT UNIONS. WE WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE ALL DOING WORK RIGHT AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF IN THE STATE THERE'S A WAY TO REPLICATE WHEN IT WORKS AND ALSO TO SAY LOOK. THIS HASN'T WORKED FOR DECADES SO THIS BILL- EASE PART OF I THINK A PIECE OF EVIDENCE- THAT WILL BE COLLECTED TO INFORM. DECISIONS AND THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A DECISION IT DOESN'T CREATE A VERDICT BUT IT DOES SAY WE'RE GOING TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. AND SET. A BILL MOVES FORWARD ON THE FIGHT GO SCORE ON THE CREDIT HISTORY YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE CAN KIND OF AT AMP IT UP AND TALK MORE ABOUT IT IN EXPLICITLY POINT OUT WHERE IT SAYS WHAT- YEAH I CAN BE. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN PART OF ANY QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND. HOW THIS CAN SHAPE. FOR ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS NO MATTER WHERE THEY'RE AT- BETTER YOU KNOW SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND LENDING- IN YOU KNOW AS A FIRST GENERATION- YOU KNOW. BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME YOU KNOW WHOSE PARENTS ARE IMMIGRANTS- I MEAN IT'S THE HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH IS NOT LIKE THIS IS NOT JUST FOCUSED ON THAT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. WE I GET IT I FEEL IT I UNDERSTAND- THAT YOU KNOW FOR MANY- NOT BEING NOT ABLE NOT BEING ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR A HOME. MEANS YOU ARE. FROM AXIS IN A BIG WAY AND- YOU KNOW THE NEXT LEVEL I THINK IS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND WHERE DID THEY GET RIGHT THE LOAN AND CAN THEY DO YOU KNOW DO THAT TOO BUT FOR ALL OF THESE THINGS MEAN SOMETHING FOR THE WEALTH WE BUILD- DON'T BUILD- HERE. IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS BUT THAT EQUITY ALSO MEANS WE LOOK AT EVERYONE'S YOU KNOW BACKGROUND- AND THEIR BELIEVE. ME BUT IT. I MEAN THERE'S JUST SOME TRENDS IN SOME HISTORY THAT DON'T ADD UP. AND THEY'RE BASED ON. RACE AND ETHNICITY AND THEY JUST DON'T. AND THIS IS WHY AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THE HISTORY BUT IT IS- IT IS A HISTORY THAT IS PART. OF THIS INDUSTRY AND I THINK ELECTIVELY WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT I BLIEVE THAT OUR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DON'T WANT. THAT HISTORY. BUT WE HAVE TO ALSO. ABOUT WHAT EXIST. I'M ONE LAST QUESTION ON FOR MY- GRANDCHILDREN AND MY COLLEAGUES BUT JUST ON MY ON MY BEHALF. IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY THAT WITH IN THIS DATA COLLECTION OR STUDIES- ONCE WE START INTERPRETING AND ANALYZING THE DATA. COULD THERE BE A COMPONENT THERE OF- FINANCIAL LITERACY UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I THINK THAT ALSO. HAS AN IMPACT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ON YOUR FIVE GOALS SCORED IN THE RISK FACTOR AND I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO GIVE A MORE IN DEPTH LOOK ASKED TO. NOT JUST THE RACE AND ETHNICITY BUT ALSO ON THE DECISION MAKING OVERALL AND I THINK THAT COULD BE A UNIFORM- YOU KNOW NINE COLOR NON- RACED- MORE OF A NEUTRAL. FACTOR IN ALSO TRYING TO ANALYZE THIS DATA IT JUST. I'M NOT SURE IF IT CAN BE PLACED IN THIS PART- IT WHERE IT COULD BE BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT FINANCIAL LITERACY. IS A HUGE COMPONENT INTO HOW WE MAKE DECISIONS AND HOW THAT AFFECTS OUR HIGH I PIKO SCORES WHAT TYPE OF PRODUCTS WE QUALIFY FOR AS WELL AS- THE INTEREST RATES THAT WE PAY OF THOSE AND SO. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AT SOME. HOW SOME AT SOME LEVEL WE MAY WANNA START ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS- BECAUSE IT DOES MAKE AN IMPACT SPECIALLY IF YOU'RE- AN IMMIGRANT OR SOMEONE WHO'S MIGRATED TO THIS COUNTRY- THAT THAT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON YOUR- YOUR FIGHT GO SCORES AND YOUR ABILITY TO. NOT TALK ABOUT THE RULING AS BUT THAT COULD BE ALSO IN THERE BUT I THINK THAT IS JUST ONE NEUTRAL FACTOR THAT COULD REALLY AFFECT- THE DATA. INTERPRET THE DATA AS WELL. AS WE CAN WE CAN LOOK INTO IT I FEEL LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT AREA AND YOU KNOW TERMS OF THE BILL STATUE BUT WE CAN LOOK INTO IT AND TRY TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND. YEAH IF UNDERLYING ADAM BEFORE AND YET IT DOES EFFECT IN ON THAT AND SO ON THAT'S ALL I HAVE ANYONE ELSE. OKAY I THINK. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NEIGHBORHOOD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WITH THAT- C. AS SOON AS I WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL OR- CITY- OKAY SORRY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND THE MOTION WAS MADE BY SENATOR. BRADFORD THINK THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU AT THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE AND JUDICIARY CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY LIMÓN HI LIMÓN I A SHOW ABOUT. A JOB I'D BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE CABALLERO DALY. DALY NOT VOTING THE ROSTER WESO MAN MAN I PORTANTINO. THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES IS ON CALL PERFECT PERFECT ELLEN COOPER ABSENT MEMBERS SENATOR LIMÓN WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLEASE ENTER NEXT BILL I THINK THE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THANK YOU SB FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IS A STRAIGHT FORWARD BILL THAT INCREASES THE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE PRACTICES OF CHARGING OVERDRAFT FEES AT OUR STATE LICENSE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS AS YOU ALL KNOW OVERDRAFT FEES ARE HIGH COST AND ACOSTA HI COST FORM OF SHORT TERM CREDIT THESE FEES ARE OFTEN AROUND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR EACH TRANSACTION THAT CAUSES A NET. PLANTS IN A CONSUMER'S ACCOUNT GIVEN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF ACCOUNTS ARE BROUGHT BACK TO POSITIVE BALANCES WITHIN A WEEK WHEN THE CONSUMER GETS THEIR NEXT DEPOSIT THESE HIGH FEES ARE SIMPLY NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE COST OF PROVIDING OVERDRAFT CREDIT FOR SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD WE ALSO NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHO IS BEARING THE BURDEN OF THESE FEES AS NOTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CONSUMERS PAY 80% OF ALL OVERDRAFT FEES. THESE CONSUMERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN AND PEOPLE WITH VOLATILE INCOMES LAST YEAR WHEN THIS COMMITTEE HEARD A BILL ABOUT A STATE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LO FI BANK ACCOUNTS SEVERAL MEMBERS. MADE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WITH LOWER BALANCES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE PAYING THE MOST FEES. AND I THINK YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. WE HAVE ALLOWED IT FOR A SYSTEM TO FLOURISH THAT PUTS THE BURDEN ON VULNERABLE CONSUMERS TO SUBSIDIZE FREE ACCOUNTS FOR HIGH INCOME EARNERS AND TO ALLOW BANKING CREDIT UNIONS TO GENERATE PROFITS OFF OF YOUNG FAMILIES AND WORK TO NEED THESE FUN TO MAKE AND- I'M ENCOURAGED. BY WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM FEDERAL REGULATORS IN CRACKING DOWN ON HOW SOME OF THE BANKS CHARGE OVERDRAFT FEES AND WE HAVE SOME EARLY SIGNS. THAT THE BANKS ARE RESPONDING WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM BANK SAYING THAT THEY ARE REMOVING SOME OF THESE FEES AND THEY'RE RETHINKING THESE FEES ALL TOGETHER. HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME THERE ISN'T OVERSIGHT GAP IN UNDERSTANDING WHETHER SMALLER BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS ARE RELYING ON OVERDRAFT FEES TO GENERATE INCOME. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY CLOSE THE GAP. DURING THE ALL BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS SUBJECT TO THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT REPORT. ANNUALLY THE TO THE TO THE STATE OVERSIGHT REPORT ANNUALLY ON THEIR OVERDRAFT REVENUE. FIRST AND FOREMOST I THINK THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF CONSUMERS AND- CONSIDERING POLICIES THAT PROTECT. THE CONSUMERS. BUT ALSO IF WE SEE FEDERAL REGULATORS CHANGING THE SPACE IN CHANGING THE PRACTICE OUR STATE REGULATORS AND POLICYMAKERS ALSO NEED TO UNDER. THAT WHETHER THEY ARE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS WHETHER THERE ARE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS CONCERNS IF ANY INSTITUTIONS ARE OVERLY RELIANT ON THE SOURCE OF THESE FEATS. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS ONLY REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY IT DOES NOT TAKE US IN PROPOSED. ANY REQUEST. ON OVERDRAFT FEES ARE CHARGED. I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THIS BILL AND WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO CONSIDER WHETHER FURTHER POLICY IS APPROPRIATE HERE ARE NOT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR LEE MONNING AND- WE WILL FIRST HEAR FROM WITNESSES WANTED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT WE'LL HEAR FROM ROBERT. HERRO FROM THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE TESTIFYING OVER THE PHONE. YES GOOD MORNING MADAM VICE CHAIR AND- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BARBARELLA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE REGENERATION OF CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AN EARLY MON FIFTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND HER CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES. AT THE END OUT BUT THEN THE AUTHOR STATED- THESE OVERDRAFT FEES DISPROPORTIONATELY FALL ON POOR COMMUNITIES AND CONSUMERS OF COLOR. AND IT IS WIDELY COURAGE GENE THAT SPECIALLY SOME OF THE BIGGER BANKS ARE NOW RETHINKING THAT- HOWEVER IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY THAT IT'S A MASSIVE TREND WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. WE HOPE THAT VERY SOON THE MINIMIZATION AND OR ELIMINATION OF OVERDRAFT FEES I'M A BEST PRACTICE- BUT AS THE AUTHOR POINTED OUT IN THE MEANTIME YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN THE STATE THE FBI. AND YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE MARKET CHANGES BEING IN REAL TIME ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO AREN'T QUITE AS LARGE- THAT'S WHY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL ON THE ORIGIN.

RACED ALL KINDA NOISE ABOUT THE HIGH INTEREST RATES OF PAYDAY LENDERS AND ONLINE LENDERS- AND WHAT IMPACT THAT HAD ON CONSUMERS WHEN REALLY THE REAL CULPRITS WERE THE BANKS. WHEN YOU THINK OF WHAT BANKS CHARGE FOR ONE DOLLAR OVERDRAFT WHEN YOU BUY A CUP OF COFFEE AT STARBUCKS WITH YOUR DEBIT CARD AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE FULL SIXTY DOLLARS THE COVERED. WHEN YOU FACTOR IN FEES MANY TIMES THAT COFFEE COSTS YOU OVER TWENTY DOLLARS WHEN YOU FACTOR IN THE FEES THAT BANKS ARE CHARGING AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 103100% THAT NLINE LENDERS AND PAYDAY LENDERS WERE CHARGING WHEN BANKS ARE CHARGING A 1000% THE MAJORITY OF THEIR PROFITS ARE FROM. THESE FEES AND I'M SURPRISED THAT WE ARE NOW MORE PEOPLE CALLING IN REGARDING THIS BECAUSE- THIS IS WHAT YOU KNOW BANKRUPTING MANY. WORKING FAMILIES ARE THESE FEES THAT BANKS CHARGE AND THIS IS WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THEIR PROFITS COME FROM SO. I APPRECIATE THIS MEASURE AND FINALLY SHINING A LIGHT.

I'M SORRY IF 80% OF THESE FEES ARE. ARE ARE BEING YOU KNOW IMPOSED ON A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CONSUMERS I THINK THAT THAT IS A BIG ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT- SO WE WILL LOOK AT IT- AND BETTER UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS.
