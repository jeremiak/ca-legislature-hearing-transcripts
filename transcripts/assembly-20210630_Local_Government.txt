ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THAT AS WE FACE THIS WORST DROUGHT FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE MEMBERS I'D PUT THE RECORD TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. ACCORDING TO THE DATA THAT I HAVE THIS IS THE WORST DROUGHT IN FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS. SO CLEARLY IT REQUIRES OUR GOVERNMENT'S ATTENTION TO DEAL WITH THIS IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE. NOW THE- MEASURES THAT ARE SOME OF OUR FRIEDMAN NIGHT IT AUTHORED WITH A SERIES OF CO AUTHORS AND JOINT AUTHORS. DEALT WITH LARGER WATER DISTRICT IN FACT 75% OF THE DROUGHT IMPACTED PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. ARE FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE LESS THAN A THOUSAND PEOPLE.

DELIVERED IN THEIR COUNTY SAW AND TULARE WE'VE SEEN OTHER PLACES. HORRIBLE OUTCOMES THINGS YOU JUST CAN'T IMAGINE HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IS JUST LIKE THE PLANNING THAT WE REQUIRED UNDER THE TWO MAJOR BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED SB SIX OH SIX. AND AB SIXTEEN SIXTY EIGHT.

AND TELLING THE STORY ABOUT HOW MANY GALLONS OF WATER AND HOW MANY BUCKETS OF WATER THEY HAD ALLOCATE IN THEIR HOME THERE'S NO BETTER WAY TO TELL THE STORY AND I. WANTED TO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH HER. THANK YOU. TWENTY WELL TAKEN. ALL RIGHT- LET'S MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT. OKAY. LET ME TELL YOU WHY I THINK THIS LAWS NEEDED AS WELL. YOU KNOW I WAS LIKE MY OFFICE LIKE WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHY WE USE THIS LAW. IT'S ALWAYS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ELEMENT IS PUSH BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY- HABITAT FOR HUMANITY WHICH BUILDS HOMES HOMEOWNERSHIP NOT RENTAL PROPERTIES. BUT HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR FOLKS. AND SO THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THAT WE CREATED IN SOME PEOPLE HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE- EXPERTS HOUGHTON- WAS CREATED SOME YEARS AGO BUT THERE WAS A- A HOLE IN THE LAW IF YOU WILL. WHERE THERE WAS A LIMITATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT- THE- THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AS A QUALIFIED NOT FOR PROFIT COULD BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY COULD ACTUALLY CHOIR THE LAND ACQUIRED THE PROPERTY. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY BUILT GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE. IF FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP SO THIS IS A- A FIX IN THE LAW THAT WE UNFORTUNATELY LEARN THE HARD WAY IS WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE- MYRIADS OF WAYS TO DEAL WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING. AND THIS IS JUST ONE ANOTHER SMALL STEP IN THIS GIANT EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING. WITH A GROUP IS CREDIBLE AND AS BRILLIANT AS THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO. I SAW IN THE NEWS RELEASE THE OTHER DAY THAT PRESIDENT CARTER AND ROSALYNN CARTER JUST CAME OUT TO A COMMUNITY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND PLANES. TETHER TWENTY FIVE HOMES WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY. TO TURN OVER THE WITNESSES. RIGHT- OPERATOR WE ARE LOOKING FOR JAMES GERARD FROM THE HABIT OF. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY FROM ORANGE COUNTY HE WILL BE ON THE PHONE. JAMES GERARD LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JAMES GERARD AND I AM THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS COORDINATOR AT HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF ORANGE COUNTY IN MY ROLE I WORK WITH CITIES AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP FIND NEW WAYS TO BUILD AFFORDABLE AND WORKFORCE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. HABITAT'S CONTINUALLY LOOKING FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO BUILD NEW AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP HOUSING. WHEN HABITAT AND NOT THE DEVELOPER THEMSELVES ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS TO PARTNER WITH LOCAL DEVELOPERS USING THE DENSITY BONUS AND ASSIST THEM IN PROVIDING THE AFFORDABLE UNITS REQUIRED UNDER THE LAW. ESSENTIALLY HABITAT WOULD ACQUIRE THE AFFORDABLE UNITS BILL UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS AND SELL THEM TO A QUALIFIED HABITAT PROGRAM FAMILIES. UNDER OUR MODEL HABITAT REQUIRES THE AFFORDABLE UNITS AND PLACES ARE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL COVENANT ON THE HOME THIS ALLOWS HABITAT TO PURCHASE THE HOME BACK FROM OUR PROGRAM FAMILIES WHEN THEY ARE READY TO PURCHASE A FAIR MARKET RATE HOMES. WITH THE EQUITY ACCRUED UNDER THE HABITAT MODEL HABITAT THEMSELVES THE HOME TO A NEW INCOME QUALIFIED PROGRAM FAMILY THIS FURTHER FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL. INSURANCE OUR HOMES REMAIN AFFORDABLE IN PERPETUITY. THESE PARTNERSHIPS COULD HELP HABITAT BUILD MORE HOMES FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE UNDER THE CURRENT DENSITY BONUS LAW LANGUAGE HABITAT IS NOT AN ELIGIBLE PURCHASER AND THE NONPROFIT WHICH HAS LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE QUALITY HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES TO LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES. CAN HAVE A CHAT TAKES POSSESSION OF THE UNIT IN THE INTERIM WHILE WE QUALIFIED BUYERS. LOCALJURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO APPROVE THIS MODEL. THIS IS SLOWED HABITAT'S ABILITY TO PARTNER OR TO BUILD THESE PARTNERSHIPS WITH DEVELOPERS AND TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY. SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT PROVIDE THE CLARIFICATION ON WHO WOULD BE CONSIDERED A QUALIFIED BUYER AND THAT NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ALIKE HABITAT CAN HELP MAXIMIZE THE FOR SALE AFFORDABLE UNITS BILL UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS. ADDITIONALLY THIS MEASURE WILL HELP ENSURE THAT FOR SALE UNITS BILL UNDER THE DENSITY BONUS WON'T BE LOST TO MARKET RATE WHICH UNDER CURRENT LAWS TRIGGERED INTO POND RESALE THEY'RE NOT SOLD TO ANOTHER INCOME QUALIFIED BUYER WITHIN SIX MONTHS. SB SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AND SHARED THE HABITAT COULD PURCHASE THOSE UNITS. TO MAINTAIN THEIR PORTABILITY. PROVIDING LOW IN VERY LOW. INCOME FAMILY WITH US AND DECENT PLAY TO CALL HOME FOR THESE REASONS I HAVE LISTED. FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SEVEN TWENTY EIGHT AND I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR HERTZBERG AND THE ENTIRE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME TODAY THANK YOU.

THAT HELPS HOMEOWNERSHIP IN EVERY PROGRAM AVAILABLE IS BETTER WE AVOID THIS EXTRAORDINARY DETERIORATING AFFECTED THE RICH POOR DIVIDE THE POLARIZATION TRAITS HOME IS WHERE THE WEALTH IS AND IT GIVES PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. NOT BE PORTING MORE GAMES IN EQUITY IN SOME WELL SOY THIS IS JUST LOOKS LIKE IT'S A SMALL THING BUT EVERY HOUSE ONE BY ONE ALL MATTERS TOWARD HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO CARE THIS MEASURE. FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY ESCRIBO YOU KNOW SENATOR YOU MADE A COMMENT THAT I JUST WANTED TO SIT SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT AS MANY TIMES AS WE TRY TO BE THE PERFECT BILLS IN THIS BUILDING. AND THE TWO THAT SOMEONE WHO KEEPS TRACK OF THE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIX THOSEBILLS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ACTUALLY WORK FOR THE PEOPLE AND GET THOSE IMPLEMENTED APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND FOR SUCH AN ORGANIZATION LIKE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY.

SO GOOD EVENING SENATOR AND THIS IS ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB EIGHT WELCOME I THANK YOU SO MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I FIRST WANT TO SAY I THANK YOU I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THE TERM CONCURRENTLY AS IT RELATES TO MEETINGS- AND- I'M ALSO WORKING CLOSELY. WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FURTHER CLARIFY AND THE STAKEHOLDERS BEING THE CITY OF LA IN THE PLANNING OF CONSERVATION LEAGUE- THE- WE'RE WORKING ON TRYING TO MAKE SOME CLARIFICATIONS TO ASSIST. THEM AND- WE WILL WE WILL GET THERE I'M CONFIDENT AND I THINK THEY ARE ALSO- WHAT SB EIGHT DOES IS WE HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL BILL THAT WE PASSED THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT. WHICH WE ARE PUT A SUNSET ON- NOT EXPECTING A PANDEMIC AND NOT KNOWING THAT THE PANDEMIC WOULD AFFECT- IN FACT WE SHUT DOWN CONSTRUCTION SHUT DOWN MANY OF OUR PLANNING DEPARTMENTS A MANY OF OUR ZONING BOARDS. AND SO- BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS EXTEND THE SUNSET OF S. B. EIGHT SO THAT WE CAN GET OF SKEWS ME OF THE HOUSING CRISIS ACTOR SB EIGHT EXTENDS. THE PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL FOR FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS TO TWENTY THIRTY- NOW. JUST FOR MY- THAT WHAT THE HOUSING CRISIS ACTED WAS RECOGNIZED THAT. WE WILL HAVE THAT CERTAINTY HELPS HOUSING PROJECTS AND THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ZONING. FOR THEIR- LAND USE POLICIES IT SIMPLY SAYS. IF I HOUSING APPLICANTS SUBMITS A PERMIT PROPOSAL FOR A PROJECT THAT MEETS YOUR EXISTING RULES THAT INCLUDES DESIGN REVIEW THE WHOLE BIT IF IT MEETS YOUR EXISTING RULES THEN PLEASE PROCESS IT IN A TIMELY MANNER HOLD NO MORE THAN FIVE PUBLIC HEARINGS. CERTAINTY SO THAT THOSE YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE SECRET PROCESS YOU'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS TO GET YOUR S E POLICIES AND SUCH SO IF THAT HOUSING APPLICANTS MEETS THOSE RULES LET'S GIVE THEM SOME CERTAINTY AND LET'S GET IT MOVING. NOW THE REASON OF COURSE WERE TRYING TO GIVE IT THE BENEFIT OF A FEW MORE YEARS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE CONSTRUCTION STARTS DOWN RIGHT NOW WE'RE AT THE LOWEST NUMBER OF A NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING THAT WE'VE HAD IN A DECADE D. O. IN AND THAT'S BEEN FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS THE ONLY SEGMENT OF HOUSING THAT UP TO GET A LITTLE BIT IN THIS YEAR WAS SINGLE FAMILY HOMES SO WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN A VERY SIMPLE WAY.

I SEE NONE- WE ARE UNABLE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION AT THIS POINT SINCE WE DO NO HAVE A QUORUM- BUT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE HERE MORE THAN WELCOME TO DO SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK THAT THE WORLD SOME OF THE OPPOSITION. REFERENCE THAT THIS DOES NOT BENEFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN FACT IT IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT TEND TO HAVE THE LONGEST- TIME PERIOD BEFORE THEY GET THEIR APPROVAL AND AS A RESULT MANY DO NOT GET BUILT BECAUSE THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON TAX CREDITS AND OTHER TYPES OF FINANCING THAT BY THE TIME THEY FINALLY GET THE GREEN LIGHT. THAT IS NO LONGER THERE FINANCING IS EITHER NOT ADEQUATE ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE SO THE MOST THE SUCCESS STORY SO FAR HAVE BEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS BUT- WITH THAT THE ONLY THING I WOULD ALSO MENTION IS THAT THE ORIGINAL HOUSING CRISIS ACT DID PASS ON WITH A BI PARTISAN VOTE AND THIS EXTENSION SB EIGHT PAT OF BIPARTISAN VOTE ON THE SENATE FLOOR WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. PHONE- THANK YOU SENATOR- REALLY WORK- APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK ON YOUR DOING ON ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED SOME EARLY SUCCESS IN REMOVING BARRIERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND I APPRECIATE YOU MAKING THE COMMENTS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN AND HOW THIS ALL WORKS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THE PANDEMIC DEPRIVE US OF THE UP TO SEE THE LAW FUNCTION IN NORMAL ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THE LAST FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD SO THE PROVISIONS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS YOU INTENDED ON THE MOTION WILL BE TO DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ONCE WE GET A QUORUM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FIVE SENATORS LET'S MOVE ON TO YOUR ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT SB TWO NINETY. THANKS MUCH THIS IS THE EXACT BILL THAT WAS ON YOUR FLOOR. AT THE LAST DAY OF SESSION IT HAD SIXTY SEVEN FIVE VOTES- ON IT JUST BECAUSE OF THAT TIME PERIOD ON THE LAST DAY OF SESSION. THE SENATE WAS NOT ABLE TO TAKE IT OUT- I CAN GO INTO THE DETAILS BUT I THINK MOST OF YOU'RE FAMILIAR. AND I WILL TURN IN THE STATE NOW TO- BRANDON YOUNG. WHO MY WITNESSES THE FROM THE ASSOCIATED STUDENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND PATRICK KENNEDY FROM PANORAMIC INST. INTERESTS THANK YOU OPERATOR OPEN THE LINES FOR MR YOUNG AND MR KENNEDY. OKAY THANK YOU THIS IS PATRICK KENNEDY CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OH GREAT MY NAME IS PATRICK KENNEDY AND I AM AN INFILL DEVELOPER- IN THE BAY AREA I FIRST USED DENSITY BONUS LAW ON BERKELEY I THINK WHEN- SENATOR SKINNER WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER THERE AS A MATTER OF FACT IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. AND I USE IT AGAIN IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWENTY SIXTEEN IT TOOK EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE LAW IN GETTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILT OUT AT VERY LOW COST BECAUSE IT'S IT REQUIRES A SET ASIDE A- BELOW MARKET RATE UNITS. IN A MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENTS AND AT NO COST TO THE CITIES- THE NEW OF PROVISIONS OF SB NINETY. EXTEND THE BENEFITS- THE DENSITY BONUS ACT TO STUDENTS- AND ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT HOUSING SOMETHING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED CERTAINLY IN BERKELEY AND MANY OTHER CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I READ RECENTLY THAT THE- THE CHANCELLOR SAID THAT 40% OF THE STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY. CANNOT LIVE WITHIN TWO MILES OF CAMPUS AND HAVE TO LIVE- AT DESTINATION I HAVE AT THAT LOCALES VERY FAR REMOVED FROM FROM- FROM THE CAMPUS ITSELF- THIS LAW IS A SIMPLE- AND I THINK- POWERFUL FIX THAT WILL. UTILIZE DENSITY BONUS LAW ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS THAT ARE- IN SORE NEED OF HOUSING AS ARE MANY OTHERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO PASS IT AS AS PROPOSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR KENNEDY ARE YOU AVAILABLE. YES RIGHT HERE THANK YOU. MISTER YOU YOU MAY MISTER BRANDON YOUNG HOUSE BRENDAN YOUNG I'M SORRY SO- BRANDED LIKE SPEAK. HI THERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. MY NAME IS BRANDON YOUNG AND I WILL BE A SENIOR UC BERKELEY NEXT YEAR AND ALSO SERVED AS THE CHAIR OF THE HOUSING COMMISSION FOR THE ASSOCIATED STUDENT BODY. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASUC REPRESENTS MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY THANKFULLY EACH OF WHICH DOESN'T HAVE TO TESTIFY WE WOULD LIKE TO LEND OUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL TO NINETY WHICH WOULD STRENGTHEN THE STATE DENSITY BONUS LAW. IN PARTICULAR WE WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THE ADDITIONAL CONCESSIONS FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING PROJECTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE DENSITY BONUS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT FOR NEARLY EVERY POLICY INTERVENTION USED TO EITHER PROTECT RENTERS ARE PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. STUDENTS ARE EXCLUDED PART OF THAT IS THE NATURE OF A CONSTANTLY TRANSITORY RENTER POPULATION. MAKING RENT CONTROLLED UNITS CONSTANTLY RESET TO MARKET RATE IS ALL DISTRACTED STUDENTS ARE INELIGIBLE FOR TRADITIONAL DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. FOR THE DEMOGRAPHIC CIVIC LEADERS CALL THE FUTURE LOCAL AND STATE HOW THE POLICY IS SPELLED STUDENTS DRAMATICALLY. THAT'S WHY TWENTY SEVENTEEN SURVEY ADMINISTERED BY THE CAMPUS SO THAT 10% OF STUDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND GENERALLY AT UC BERKELEY. IF YOU COULD SEE THE WAY STUDENTS CRAMMED INTO ONE OR TWO BEDROOM APARTMENTS IN ORDER TO AFFORD RENTS IN BERKELEY. THE IMAGERY WOULD BE SHOCKING ON THE LEVELS OF JACOB REES PHOTO ESSAY HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES DEBATING TENEMENT HOUSING IN EARLY TWENTY TH CENTURY NEW YORK CITY. WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR SENATOR SKINNER'S CONTINUED EFFORTS TO INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. NEARLY THREE YEARS AFTER ITS PASSAGE HOWEVER NO PROJECTS IN THE CITY OF BERKELEY HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE 35% DENSITY BONUS PROVIDED BY S. B. TWELVE TWENTY SEVEN THE INITIAL BILL SAYING THE RAFTER FOREMOST IN HOUSING DENSITY BONUS LAW. ADDING ADDITIONAL CONCESSION WHICH IS USUALLY SOMETHING LIKE WITH THE PARKING ARE BUILDING FORM CONSTRAINTS WOULD HELP MAKE SUCH PROJECTS MORE ATTRACTIVE. THAT MAY ONLY BE INCONSEQUENTIAL INCREMENTAL IN THE FUTURE WE HOPE TO SEE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING. FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA COMPATIBILITY CHARTER AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING MS. ANYWAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.

SB SEVEN TWELVE SENATOR HUESO SENATOR YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS. SB SEVEN TWELVE WILL RECTIFY YEARS OF LONGSTANDING DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE DEPRIVE NATIVE AMERICANS FROM A FAIR PROCESS IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO ACQUIRE THEIR ASSISTANCE ASTRAL LANDS. NATIVE AMERICANS HAVE SUFFERED FROM DECADES OF VIOLENCE MISTREATMENT EXPLOITATION ATTEMPT TO DESCRIBE THE DESTRUCTION OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AND DISPOSSESSION OVENS AND SESTRA LANDS TO IN TODAY IN OUR IN OUR- COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA- NATIVE AMERICANS STILL HAVE THE HIGHEST HIGH SCHOOL. DROP OUT RATES THE LOWEST HIGH SCHOOL- MATRICULATION RATES THE LOWEST COLLEGE- AT. ATTAINMENT RATES- AND- HAD THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES REALLY MORE THAN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS THEY REALLY RANK- THE- THEY OUTPERFORM EVERYBODY JUST OF THE- ALL THE CATEGORIES THAT. THAT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE POVERTY AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S STILL NOT VERY WELL KNOWN BY THE PEOPLE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO REVERSE THAT AND I'M WORKING ON A BILL THAT HOPEFULLY WILL WILL HELP. BE- SOMETHING THAT ADDRESSES THAT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND MOST DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF. THE NATIVE PEOPLES CAME FROM WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S CALLED THE GENERAL ALLOTMENT ACT OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN SO AROUND TIME- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PUTTING ALL THE NATIVE AMERICANS ON RESERVATIONS. WHAT THE GENERAL A LOT THEY SO THEY BASICALLY LOWER DEMAND TO RESERVATIONS THEY WILL GIVE YOU LAND LAND THAT YOU CAN FARM. IN MANY CASES SOME OF THAT LAND WAS ARABLE BUT THE GENERAL LACHMAN AND IF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN BASICALLY REDUCED. THEIR LANDS TO LANDS THAT WERE NOT FIREABLE NOT LIVEABLE. AND THEY WERE REALLY REDUCED TO ONLY RECEIVING GOVERNMENT AID. AND AS A RESULT THEY SUFFERED FROM THE WORST SCHOOLS THE WORST- OF DIETS- NO- JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND- BUT TODAY THERE IS SOME OF THE POOREST CENSUS TRACTS IN AMERICA. IN FACT THE NUMBER ONE POOREST CENSUS TRACT IN AMERICA IS A IS A NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY ALLOWS FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES TODAY TAKE BACK THOSE LOST ANCESTRAL LANDS EVEN SOMETIMES THE LANDS THAT WERE PROMISED TO THEM ORIGINALLY. THROUGH WHAT IS CALLED A FEEDER TRUST ACQUISITION PROCESS THE FEEDER ACQUISITION PROCESS IS A REQUEST BY A TRIBE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZE THAT THE LAND THEY ALREADY OWN. THANK YOU. THE TO BE INCLUDED IN THEIR RESERVATIONS FEEDERS PRESS ACQUISITION PROVIDES THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS IN AN EQUITABLE WILL OPPORTUNITY TO REQUIRE THEIR TREASURED TRADITIONAL LANDS UNFORTUNATELY. IT IS UNCOMMON FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT PETER TRUST ACQUISITION THEY POSE IT EVEN IF IT LOSES IF THE LOSSES TO LOOK LOCAL JURISDICTION OR MINIMAL OR TO NONE SOMETIMES YOU GET MORE FEDERAL FUNDING INTO A COUNTY BECAUSE OF THAT AND SOMETIMES IS A BENEFIT. SO BLANKET OPPOSITION POLICIES ARE ARE REFLECTIVE OF HISTORICAL STRUCTURAL RACISM. AND DISCRIMINATION AGAINST NATIVE AMERICANS. IT TO WHICH CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PART SB SEVEN TWELVE IS A BILL THAT WERE FOR THEIR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO RECTIFY PAST MISTAKES. AND PROVIDE NATIVE AMERICANS THE FAIRNESS THEY DESERVE AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT THIS BILL WOULD BASICALLY PREVENT ANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT FROM TAKING. A POSITION IN OPPOSITION OF AT THE EVENT APPLICATION BEFORE IT EVEN ARRIVES SO- I WANT TO THANK- THE CHAIRMAN AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND- AND IDENTIFY IN SOME SOME IMPROVEMENTS- THAT. NEEDED TO BE MADE SO THAT WITH US FOR BEEN VERY HELPFUL THIS IS I THINK THIS BILL READY FOR YOUR SUPPORT WE HAVE- CHAIRMAN BO MAZZETTI WITH THE RINCON BAND OF LOSING YOUR INDIANS. AND WE HAVE A CHAIR PERSON ERICA PINTO FROM THE FAMILY IN THE VILLAGE THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. IF YOU ALLOW MANAGER ABSOLUTELY- GENERATOR OPEN THE LINE FOR THE CHAIRMAN WAS SETTING AND CHAIRPERSON PINTO PLEASE. BOTH THE WITNESS LINES ARE OPEN THANK YOU. YOUR CURRENT TERM READY ARE YOU READY TO HEAR ME YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. PLEASE FOLLOW UP ABOUT YOUR PERSONALITY I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOUR COMMITTEE. AND BETHANY IS UNDER WAY SO FOR UNDERSTANDING. WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PEOPLE. OUR ANCESTORS. ARE PEOPLE RAN WAS TAKEN. WILL WE EVER GET IT BACK PROBABLY NOT. BUT SOME OF US HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

PLEASE AND YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES PLEASE. HI GOOD VENING HONORED CHERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERICA PINTO AND I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS THE CHAIRWOMAN. OF THE HUMBLE IN INTELLIGENCE CALIFORNIA. I TRIED FIRST I WANT TO THANK SENATOR HUESO FOR HIS COMPASSIONATE. THOUGHTFUL AND RELEVANT COMMENT AT THE START. OF MY TRIBE IS ONE OF EIGHTEEN FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- RESERVATIONS. MY RESERVATIONS THE TIME ONLY SIX ACRES OF LAND MAKING US ONE OF THE SMALLER. RIVAL RESERVATIONS IN THE COUNTRY FOR ABOUT TWENTY MILES OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO. LIKE MOST IN THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FIRSTHAND THE UNFAIR AND DISCRIMINATORY PROCESS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS USED. TO TRY AND BLOCK TRAVEL FEE TO TRUST APPLICATION. INCENDIO COUNTY MY TRIBE IN PARTICULAR HAS FACED BLANKET OPPOSITION TO OUR EFORTS TO EXPAND OUR LAND BASED PER LONG STANDING COUNTY POLICY AT SHERMAN MEANT THAT INVENTION. COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO RECENTLY RESCINDED THIS POLICY. WHICH WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. FROM I TRIED TO TRUST COULD MEET ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOUSING EDUCATION OR CULTURAL CENTER HEALTH CARE FACILITY OPPORTUNITIES THAT CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST. CHAIRMAN OF ANY ALSO MENTIONED THAT TRIED TO GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE GIVEN IN THE IN THE FORM OF MONETARY DONATION SERVICES EMERGENCY SERVICES. SHARE PURPOSES AMBULATORY SERVICES WE GIVE BACK THE FEE TO TRUST PROCESS ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUBMIT COMMENTS OVER ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT ON REGULATORY JURISDICTION. REAL PROPERTY TAXES ESPECIALISTA. UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT RARELY SUPPORTS THESE APPLICATIONS EVEN IF THE IMPACT THE LOSSES ARE MINIMAL AND THE BENEFITS THE TRIBE AND THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES ARE SUBSTANTIAL. SADLY MY TRIBE HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO THIS TYPE OF BLIND AND UNSUPPORTED OPPOSITION IN SAN DIEGO FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS I HOPE THIS WILL CHANGE SB SEVEN TWELVE HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY ENSURING THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE BENEFITS A FEW TO TRUST ACQUISITION. HELP US REGAIN OUR ANCESTRAL LAND HELP THE TRIED TO REGAIN OUR LAND THAT WAS ONCE HOURS. GIVEN THIS IN OUR HISTORY WE STRONGLY ENDORSE SB SEVEN TWELVE AND ENCOURAGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE PASSAGE TODAY I THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY HERE THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'LL NOW MOVE INTO OPPOSITION WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION I ONLY HAVE ONE REGISTER THAT WOULD BE CHRIS LEE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION. OF COUNTIES. ON THE- GOOD EVENING CHER AGUIAR-CURRY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS CRITICALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REGRETTABLY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB SEVEN TWELVE I PERSONALLY WANT TO SAY WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE P. TO TRUST PROCESS AND THE ABILITY FOR TRIED TO HAVE LAND TAKEN INTO TRUST TO RESTORE THEIR ANCESTRAL LAND BASES FOR ALL THE REASONS POINT OUT BY THE AUTHOR- IN THE PROPONENTS OF THE LEGISLATION. WE DO HOWEVER HAVE TO CONCERNS BOTH PRACTICAL AND POLICY CONCERNED THAT WE'VE OUTLINED IN PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY STATEMENT THAT THE STATE SHOULD REQUIRE LOCAL AGENCIES TO TAKE AN INDIVIDUAL POSITION RATHER THAN HAVING A POLICY OF BLANKET OPPOSITION TO BE A TRUST ACQUISITIONS WE HAVE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CLARIFY WHAT COUNTY CITIES CAN AND CAN'T DO- MAKE IT MUCH MORE EXPLICIT IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH OTHER PROVISIONS RELATED TO WHAT A COUNTY OR CITY REPLYING TO AT THE LOCATION OF COMMENTS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THIRTY DAY DETOX NOTED MUCH TO DO THE BILL GIVES YOU FIVE DAYS TO REACH OUT TO THE TRIED TO ASK FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN FIVE DAYS FOR THE TRIED TO APPLY. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A TIGHT TIME FRAME WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A THIRTY DAY PRIOD ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STAFF PERSON WHO RECEIVED THIS NOTICE CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE POSITION OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR CITY COUNCIL THE CASE MAY BE WILL BE ON THE APPLICATION ESPECIALLY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL ALTHOUGH THE BILL REQUIRES COUNTIES TO INCLUDE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE TRIBE FOR STUDENTS THAT CONSULTATION PROCESS. THAT'S COMING FROM BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE FEE TO TRUST APPLICATION SO WE PROPOSED LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BETTER ALIGN A REQUIREMENT TO CONSIDER THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THE NEED FOR THE LAND THE OTHER THING THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE TRIBE'S. REQUESTED A BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TO HAVE WEDNESDAY INTO. WE THINK MORE WORK OF WE ALL THINK IT MORE. WAY RATHER THAN IN FOR. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELEVANT THE APPLICATION AT HAND REQUIRING THAT IT BE SUBMITTED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS STATED IN THE APPLICATION IS A BETTER WAY TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE. WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ITS CONSIDERATION OF OUR REQUEST. AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO RESOLVE THESE CONCERNS.

FOR A THREE THE NUMBER ONE ITEM ON THE AGENDA. AGAIN WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING A COMPLETE ORDER THIS EVENING BUT WE HAVE TECHNICAL AND NOT JUST THE T. EVENING WE HAD TO KIND OF GO OUT OF ORDER SO AGAIN WE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT IN RHODE MOVING FORWARD WITH S. B. FOUR ZERO THREE ITEM NUMBER ONE. START WHENEVER YOU LIKE THINGS TO GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS BEFORE I BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES IS A SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES NINE THROUGH TEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE OF AS WELL FOR THEIR- DETAILED ANALYSIS- THIS IS BILL SB FOUR ZERO THREE WHICH WILL PROVIDE STATE WATER AUTHORITIES WITH A WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO HELP CALIFORNIA. FINALLY REALIZE THE RIGHT TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. IN TWENTY FIVE FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH PROVIDED THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE CONSOLIDATIONS FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT SERVE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. WELL THIS AUTHORITY IS IMPORTANT IN THE STATE'S SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS THAT CAN ONLY BE USED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. AND THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY PROVIDING AND SAFE WATER WHICH MAKES NO SENSE SB FOUR OH THREE PROVIDES A PROACTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. BY EXPANDING- SB EIGHTY UPON SB EIGHTY CONSOLIDATION AUTHORITY. MEMBERS WATER PORTS RECENTLY RELEASED RISK ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED OVER SIX HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILING INDETERMINATE ONE THIRD OF THE ACESTA MASTIC WELLS WERE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY THOUSAND WELLS. FOR CLASSIFIED AS HIGH RISK TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY I HAVE MICHAEL CLAIBORNE DIRECTING ATTORNEY FOR LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND JENNIFER CLARY THE CALIFORNIA STATE DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- EXCUSE ME OPERATOR WE'RE LOOKING. FOR MISTER CLAIBORNE TO MISS CLARY. GOOD EVENING TO THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THE MICROPLATE WALKING OUT HERE ME YES WE CAN. RIGHT A DIRECTING ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION BASED IN SAN JOAQUIN EAST COACHELLA VALLEY. OR PROUD TO BE SPONSORING SB FOUR THREE AND THANK SENATOR GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DIFFICULT AND DIFFICULT FOR THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS AND HOUSEHOLD VERIFIED THE METRIC WHILE IT CONSISTENTLY TO FIND ADEQUATE QUANTITY OF STATE DRINKING WATER- TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE CHALLENGES SMALL WATER SYSTEMS FAITH ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE WHICH IS THE MOST VULNERABLE TO INCREASING GROUNDWATER POLLUTION EMERGING CONTAMINANTS. AND MORE FREQUENT AND SEVERE DROUGHT LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN NOW. AT THE SENATOR JEFF MENTIONED THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD CUT COMPLETED A DRINKING WATER NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IDENTIFIED SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND NEARLY EIGHTY THOUSAND DOMESTIC ABOUT THAT ARE AT RISK OF FAILURE. ALSO NOTE THAT APPROXIMATELY FORTY SEVEN NEW WATER SYSTEMS GO OUT OF COMPLIANCE EVERY YEAR. IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS ON DRINKING WATER ACCIDENTS WE MUST PROACTIVELY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO AVERAGE WATER SYSTEMS. AND WHERE IT MAKES SENSE THIS BILL TAKING VALIDATION OF WATER SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELLS WITH NEARBY LARGER AND MORE SUSTAINABLE WATER SYSTEMS. SB FOUR THREE FAILED ON AT THE EIGHTY EIGHT FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN TO EIGHT IN THE STRUGGLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE STATE BOARD DID NOT HAVE ANY-EFFECTIVE TOOLS TO GET STAKEHOLDERS AND COURT ROOM TO TALK ABOUT CONSOLIDATION. IF IT JUST HAS NOT YET FAILED EVEN IF IT'S ENTIRELY PREDICTABLE THAT IT WILL FAIL. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO WAIT CURRENT SYSTEM TO FAIL PARKING FAMILIES TO LOSE ACCESS TO WATER. AND THE STATE INEFFICIENTLY EXPEND PUBLIC FUNDS TO DELIVER BOTTLED WATER. INSTEAD THE STATE'S WORK PRACTICALLY ALONGSIDE COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS FOR WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE AT RISK AND ON THE CUSP OF FAILURE. I THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING. WITH US AND WE ARE NOT ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF NORMA FOR MISS PLAYING. BUSINESS AREA CLARA THANK. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS HI MY NAME IS JENNIFER QUERY AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION OUR ORGANIZATION IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF SB FOUR OH THREE AND I'M ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF CLEAN WATER CENTER ALSO COOK HAS SPONSORED ITSELF AS MICHAEL MENTIONED EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. OF CALIFORNIA TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED COMMUTING WATER SYSTEMS YOUR FEWER THAN A THOUSAND RESIDENTS AT ANY GIVEN TIME ROUGHLY ONE IN SEVEN OF THE SECOND CALPERS BY TAKING WATER AND WE NOW KNOW THAT ABOUT ONE IN THREE ARE AT RISK OF FAILURE. EVERYTHING SOMETHING TO REMEMBER IS THAT WHEN A COMMUNITY LOSE ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IT DOESN'T JUST IMPACT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THAT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IT ALSO CREATES THIS LINGERING TRUST ISSUE SO EVEN WHEN YOU GET. THAT WATER BACK EVEN. AFTER THAT ACCESS IS RETURNED. MANY COMMUNITY CAN TO RELY BOTTLED INTENDED. BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T TRUST THAT THEIR WATER IS SAFE AND THAT IMPOSES A FINANCIAL BURDEN ON LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IT'S JUST A GENERAL. IT LINGERING ISSUE OF COST FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE ALTOGETHER. NOW THE STATE BOARD STICKING WATER NEEDS ASSESSMENT REFERENCE BY MICHAEL IN THE SENATOR HAS CREATED A TOOL TO MEASURE AND MONITOR THE STATE ABILITY OF OUR PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. AND THAT TOOL SHOWS THAT FIFTY SIX CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE AT LEAST ONE WATER SYSTEM CLASSIFIED IT AS- WELL. THAT MEANS THAT ANYONE OF YOU MAY RECEIVE A CALL FROM A CONSTITUENT THIS WEEKEND ABOUT A SYSTEM IN YOUR DISTRICT IT IS NO LONGER ABLE TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. NO HE HAVE ADMITTED TO FIX THE PORTABLE DRINKING WATERFUND THE STATE NOW HAS AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE THAT SHOULD ALLOW THEM. TO PLAN FOR ATTRACTIVELY INTERESTED STATE DRINKING WATER CHALLENGES BUT FUNDING IS UNLIMITED AND THE MORE WE HAVE TO SPENT ON UNPLANNED EMERGENCIES SELECT WE HAVE TO INVEST IN NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. SO WE THINK SB FOUR OH THREE AT THE COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT PROVIDES ONE MORE TOOL TO ENSURE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH. MOTIONS WITH. MOTION MARLBORO HARPER BROUGHT IN A- DON'T THERE GUYS. NONE OF THE STUFF. THE FILM LU RIVAS IS THE SECOND. OKAY LET'S SEE HERE- I'M LOOKING FOR WE HAVE ANY OPPOSITION I BELIEVE I HAVE CINDY TUCK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND ANTHONY TEN DON'T FOR THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OPERATOR- THANK YOU YOUR REQUIRE CURRY AND MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL I DO HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION DID SENATOR GONZALEZ EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS.

THANK YOU MISS TAX- SO WE'LL MOVE ON TO ANTHONY TENNANT TENNANT CHILL TELLING HILLS BECAUSE OF. CANADA. GOOD EVENING I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS IS HAMPTON WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION AND WE REMAIN RESPECTFULLY ARE OPPOSED- MUCH AMENDED THAT BUT LET ME JUST START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF AND THE SPONSORS- THROUGH THEIR OPEN DOOR POLICY DURING THE PAST OUR DELIBERATION AND ALWAYS CONSIDER AND ARGUE POINTS. WHILE WE APPLAUD THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE AND OF COURSE SHARE THE GOAL OF RELIABLE SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS MEASURE ISSUE FOR THREE HAS SOME DEFICIENCIES THAT WE LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED THE OUR MEMBERS SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH ELECTED BOARDS AND ALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS THAT OFFER WATER YOU FALL UNDER THE CATEGORY OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM NOT ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS ARE IN FACT SPECIAL DISTRICTS SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE CREATED BY THE VOTER AND ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THE VOTER. THEY'RE LIKE TO BOARD MEMBERS LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BATES TRANQUIL WATER AND PAY THE SAME RATES AS THE CONSTITUENTS AND THEY CERTAINLY WANT SAFE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE. DRINKING WATER SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY. SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ACCOUNT. THAT WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT WEATHER'S BROWN ACT- PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. RATEPAYER PROTECTIONS TRANSPARENCY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS MEASURE TREATS THE LOCAL ELECTED AGENCIES THE SAME AS A PRIVATE SYSTEM OR EVEN A FOR PROFIT YSTEM. AND WHILE THE VAST MAJORITY OF AT RISK OF WATER SYSTEMS ARE NOT SPECIAL DISTRICTS. NOT PUBLIC AGENCIES COLLECTED BOARDS ARE NOT INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICTS EVEN ACCORDING TO THE STATE WATER BOARDS RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT. OUR SPECIAL DISTRICTS REPRESENT- WE THINK THIRTY NINE OUT OF THE SIX HUNDRED- TWENTY ASH AT RISK SYSTEMS. AND OUR MEMBERS EXPERIENCE SPECIAL DISTRICTS ARE OFTEN THE AGENCY HELPING TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEIGHBORING WATER SYSTEM. IT'S APPROPRIATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE OUR NUMBER STAND READY TO CONTINUE THAT WORK. HOWEVER WHAT WE OPPOSE IS INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF AND I'M ELECTED STATE BOARD TO OVERRULE A LOCAL ELECTION. I LIKE TO BOARD AND POTENTIALLY GIVE A COMMAND COMMUNITIES PUBLICLY ON ASSET. TO A PRIVATE ENTITY AND THE MEASURE DOES NOT HAVE THE RECOURSE FOR LOCAL BOARD VOTERS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SAY. IN THE CASE OF PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH ELECTED BOARDS THERE IS A DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT ALREADY EXISTED ACCORDING TO MAPS HERTZBERG ACT. AND I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH PUBLIC AGENCIES IN A WAY THAT. GETS ON THE RIGHT TO WATER. AND RESPECTS THE RIGHTS OF LOCAL BOARDERS MOTORISTS- WE HAVE OFFERED SOME AMENDMENTS AND WE FOUND WOULD HELP PROTECT THESE DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS. ARMENIAN SECOND A LITTLE MORE CERTAINLY OPEN TO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN TO ANY IDEAS THAT WOULD AFFECT THE SAME GOAL SO I'LL CLOSE WITH. WITH BACKPACKS THE STATE TO HELP ASSESS SEVEN POWER I WOULD DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE TO MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE OVER THEIR WATER SYSTEM AND WE LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL- ON THIS MEASURE AND BEYOND- AND I'M GETTING IT RIGHT.

THERE WE ARE AGAIN IS SB CAN VIRTUALLY THE SAME BILL WITH SOME SMALL TWEAKS MOST CONCERNING ABOUT SB TENNIS SECTION ONE BEGIN AT ANY CITY OR COUNTY IN THE STATE. WE WILL TAKE IN OVER RIGHT AWAY. IN THIS. REPORT MAJORITY VOTE OF THE COUNCIL YOU CAN'T OVER RIDE VOTER APPROVED INITIATIVE BY A THREE FIFTHS VOTE OF THE CITY COUNCIL ANY MORE THAN YOU COULD OVERRIDE IT WITH UNANIMOUS VOTE. THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE INITIATIVE PROCESS TO ALLOW VOTERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN LAWS DIRECTLY. ARTICLE TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SIMPLY STATES INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM POWERS MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE ELECTORS OF EACH CITY OR COUNTY. YOU CAN'T UNDO THESE POWERS RESERVED IN CONSTITUTION WITH LEGISLATION IT REQUIRES A STATEWIDE PUBLIC VOTE 2% WE MAY NOT LIKE IT BEING LEGISLATORS OURSELVES BUT THIS FORM OF DIRECT DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN RESERVED OUR STATE CONSTITUTION FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. SURE THIS IS A VOLUNTARY BILLS OF THE SPEAKER I NEED A COUNCIL NEED DO NOTHING BUT Y. MISLEAD THEM INTO THINKING THEY CAN VIOLATE THE STATE CONSTITUTION IS S. B. TENCENT YES. AND WHY ALLOW THEM TO CIRCUMVENT PROPER ENVIRONMENT ONE HOUSES WHEN THIS BILL COULD ALLOW THE ADDITION OF THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO A CITY OR COUNTY. A KEY COMPONENT MISSING IN SB TENDED ANY REFERENCE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS IS NOTHING BUT A MARKET RATE HOUSING BILLS THE IDEA THAT ADDING MORE MARKET RATE HOUSING WILL TRICKLE DOWN TO AFFORDABLE UNITS S. SPECULATIVE ANY DUBIOUS CONCLUSION. MANDATE 30% OF THIS PROJECT THE LOW INCOME HE WILL BE ADDRESSING THE REAL PROBLEMS HAVE A CALIFORNIA. SENATOR WIENER PULLED THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL SECTION FROM SB NINE OH TWO LAST YEAR. YOU SHOULD PULL IT AGAIN FROM S. B. TEN THIS YEAR.

NUMBER WOULD BRING CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES SUCH AS LOCAL EFFORTS TO CREATE THAT BACKING PLATE OIL GRAYSON HOMES. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING INITIATIVES SUCH AS INCLUSIONARY HOUSING AND RENT CONTROL OKAY LIBATION MEASURES FURTHERMORE IT IS PERMITTED AEROBICS BUT THEY'VE ALL OF THE JEWS IT IS VERY TO REDRESS THESE ISSUES. ADDITIONALLY I THINK THAT WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TURN A BLIND EYE THE HOUSE ONLY DECISIONS WOULD IMPACT ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND THE VERY PEOPLE DISCORDANT DIFFICULT THE BENEFIT.

AND YOU CAN SEE THAT I BELIEVE ONLINE SO WE HAVE A WRITTEN TESTIMONY CAN COME THROUGH A POSITION PORTAL ON A COMMITTEE AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE WEBSITE. OKAY SO- WILL MOVE TO QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKING. YEAH I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY- APOLOGIZING FOR THE DURATION OF. DISRESPECTING SUPPRESSION BY A NUMBER OF THE COLLAR'S NOT WAS INEXCUSABLE NO MATTER WHAT THEIR POSITION HAS- BUT AS I MOVE ON THE LANGUAGE ALLOWING THIS BILL TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY COUNCIL TO OVERTURN VOTER APPROVAL ORDINANCES SEEMS TO BE A BIG OBSTACLE AND I KNOW YOU DRESSED TO LAST TIME- ARE YOU UNWILLING TO ADDRESS THAT. THROUGH THE AMENDMENT PROCESS SERVER HOW HOW. HOW FOR MORE YOU ON THAT ISSUE SURE AND IF I GET THE SIX CERTIFIED PREACHER THAT I REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LAST YEAR. SO LAST THE WHAT WE DID THIS YEAR. IS WE MADE IT. INSTEAD OF REMOVING WE MET DRAMATICALLY NARROWER- AND- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE ARE SOME CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A- SMALL NUMBER- THAT BUT BUT- IT COULD GROW- THAT HAVE MADE IT EFFECTIVELY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR CITY COUNCIL EVEN TO ADOPT THE HOUSING ELEMENT BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT THE ONLY WAY. YOU CAN EVEN MOVE A COMMA IN TERMS OF THE ZONING CODE THE PLAN CODE. IS TO GO TO THE VOTERS- AND SO WE HAVE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LITERALLY INCAPACITATED FROM ADOPTING EVEN HOUSING ELEMENT AND DOING ANY ZONING WORK WHATSOEVER- AND SO. WHAT WE DID WAS WE BASICALLY NARROWED IT DOWN TO THAT VERY NARROW SUBCLASS GETTING RID OF THE- IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT. BALLOT MEASURES THAT RESTRICT DEVELOPMENT OVERWHELMINGLY THEY ARE OPEN SPACE PROTECTION GREEN BELT THOSE KINDS OF PROMISES THAT WERE ALL FAMILIAR WITH AND WE SAW OVER THE STATE. WE REMOVE THOSE FROM THE BILL ENTIRELY AND THAT'S THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THEM- AND SO WE MADE A MUCH NARROWER TO FOCUS ON THE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT HAS CREATED A PROBLEM A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES. WHERE THEY'RE NOT EVEN ABLE TO COMPLY WITH STATE HOUSING LAWS WE'VE HAD ALSO INCREASED THE THRESHOLD EVEN FOR THAT NARROW BANDS. HAVING REMOVED THE LARGE MAJORITY ENTIRELY FOR THAT ARE BAD MAKING IT A TWO THIRDS VOTE AND SEVEN MAJORITY VOTE WAS ON MOST COUNCILS PICA BEFORE OUT OF FIVE FOR THE- YOU KNOW I THINK THE MOST COMMON FORM COUNCIL- AND AS YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW. AS AS MY COLLEAGUE IN THE SENATE SENATOR. WHO THE LOCAL GUY YOUR THEM OVER MY HOUSING BILLS SAID HE SAID IN THAT NARROW THIS NARROW SUBSET. YOU KNOW COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ACCOUNTABLE. TO THEIR VOTERS I KNOW WHEN I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT LAWS NUMBER SUPERVISORS THERE WERE SOME SITUATIONS. WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO OVERRIDE OR CHANGE BALLOT MEASURES- AND I DOUBT SOME OF THAT I WAS TAKEN EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY FOR THE REASONS THAT ALL OF US AROUND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. UNDERSTAND SO I DON'T SEE THIS IS SOMETHING WORK COUNCILS ARE GOING TO **** NILLY. DO THAT BUT IN A WAY IT IS A SAFETY VALVE. FOR THAT VERY SMALL SUBSET OF CITIES THAT HAVE THESE. BALLOT MEASURES THAT MAKE IT REALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO EVEN COMPLY WITH THAT LAW SO WE TRIED TO. IN SEVERAL LIMITING IT SAYS REALLY NARROW AND-POCASSET AND MAKE A RAZOR SHARP SO THAT'S WHAT I EXPLANATION OF HOW WE- GOT HERE. IS THAT A CONTINUING CONVERSATION OF COURSE- AND I UNDERSTAND THE YOU KNOW THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER BUT WE TRIED TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE. WELL I DO AGREE WITH THE- SENATOR GLAZERS ASSESSMENT HAVING SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR NINE YEARS AND IF YOU OVERTURN. THEIR WILL I THINK- YOU COULD SAY POTENTIALLY ADIOS TO THAT. THAT SPOT. SO THAT BEING SID- UP TO GIVE HIS SOME SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT TO APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION I APPRECIATE THAT. NUMBER OKAY I BELIEVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THREE OF US. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- YOU KNOW THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ON THIS BILL- AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS RAISED SEVERAL CONCERNS THAT MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE ALSO BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION- AND I KNOW I'VE DISCUSSED THESE WITH YOU AND YOUR PREVIOUS ITERATION. OF THIS BILL YOU KNOW THE ANALYSIS STATES THAT THIS BILL ALLOWS LOCAL AGENCIES TO REZONE AND UPS OWN CERTAIN PARCELS. WITH IT ALL UP. TO A DENSITY OF TEN UNITS PER PARCEL WITHOUT CONDUCTING A SEQUEL REVIEW IN A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT- IS A DESIGNATED VERY HIGH FIRE. HAZARD ZONE AND IT IS ALSO IN. HE NOT TRANSIT READ CHEN IT'S AN URBAN AREA- I KNOW IN IN THE ANALYSIS IT DID SAY THAT THESE ZONES TEND TO BE MORE RURAL AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE. IN MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES- AND SO I WANTED TO NOTE THIS THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE LIKE I SAID IN MY DISTRICT AND- I WOULD. JUST DEFINITELY LIKE TO SEE YOU CLARIFY THIS PROVISION. AT THEIR CLIENT YES GO AHEAD NO THANK YOU FOR THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBER BLOOM AND I'VE ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS. ABOUT THIS AND SO THE ANSWER RIGHT NOW THE VERY HIGH- WILDFIRE SEVERITIES OWNER I ALWAYS MESS UP THAT- THE NAME OF THE VERY HIGH RISK AREAS. THOSE MAPS- ARE EXEMPT FROM THE BILL- BUT THEN THERE IS AN EXCEPTION TO THAT EXEMPTION THAT'S REPRESENTS- THAT IF A CITY. AND ITS FIRE MARSHAL HAVE BASICALLY DETERMINED THAT A PARTICULAR AREA HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY MADE SAFER RIGHT YOU'D BE IT'S ON A VERY HIGH RISK MAP. BUT THIS AREA HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE YOU KNOW TO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE FIRE OFFICIALS DUE TO MAKE A NEIGHBORHOOD OR BLOCK- SAFER SO THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY THAT AREA IS NO LONGER. AT THAT SAME LEVEL OF RISK AND THAT WOULD BE OKAY AND THAT WOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION. YOU KNOW IN CONSULTATION WITH THE LOCAL FIRE MARSHAL IN USING ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA IT'S A CAL FIRE STANDARDS IF I RECALL CORRECTLY THAT HAS TO USE SO THAT'S- THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS I KNOW- THAT THERE ARE SOME OTHER ISSUES IN THE SUMMER BLOOMING I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE WHOLE. INGRESS AND EGRESS ISSUES IS ON ONE WAY TO GET IN AND GET OUT I'M VERY SENSITIVE THAT- AND I'VE ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO SOME MEMBER I'M SORRY TO SAY YOUR NAME SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BUT WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A FEW TIMES- COMMITTEE WAS WELL. THAT WE ARE THE TO WORK YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF THE IF THE COMMITTEE PASSES THE BILL OUT- BEFORE COMES TO THE FLOOR- TO DO SOME REFINEMENTS ARE. THIS LANGUAGES EXCEPTION LANGUAGE WE DID NOT CREATE A FOR THIS BILL. THIS WAS THE IS ALIVE THE EXEMPTION THAT'S IN SB THIRTY FIVE IT WAS IN OTHER- BILLS THAT I THINK A PASS TO THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR MAYBE SB TWELVE I'M NOT SURE WHICH. OFFICE THIS IS A STANDARD. TEN LANGUAGE FURTHER BURKE HIGH WHILE- IT. AND SOME SAID. TO THE FACT THAT IT IS IN A BUNCH OF. BILLS YOU DON'T WANT TO BE. SO DIFFERENT. BUT I'M VERY OPEN TO A CONVERSATION TO ADDRESS REFINER- BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. AND AS I'VE BEEN THE KIDS YOU I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SITTING DOWN- PERHAPS WITH A FEW MEMBERS. ARE TO TALK THROUGH- THAT VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. OKAY THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT COMMITMENT AND- I WILL BE FOLLOWING UP AND I KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE I KNOW THAT YOU WILL. COMMIT TO THAT ABSOLUTELY AND I KNOW YOU'RE- A GOOD MEMBER THAT FOLLOWS THROUGH. ON YOUR COMMITMENTS- AND- I MEAN BECAUSE- OF THIS DOES REQUIRE A CITY TO. PASS AN ORDINANCE IN ORDER- TO USE THIS AS A TOOL- FIFTY FOUR TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING. BUT YOU KNOW I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IF WE HAVEN'T- YOU KNOW FAR DISCUSSIONS- DON'T. RESULT IN A CHANGE. THANK YOU SURE. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBERS ONLY MEMBER VOEPEL. SO I SUPPORT THIS BILL NOW I DID NOT IN THE PAST I WAS OUT OF THE GATE AGAINST IT FOR ALL THE SAME REASONS THAT ALL THE OPPOSITION HAVE. TESTIFIED ON BUT- I FIND SENATOR WIENER TO BE VERY- THOROUGH IN HIS RESPONSES TO ME AND I APPRECIATE THAT GREATLY HE IS NOT A SILVER TONGUED DEVIL BUT HE IS REASONABLE HE'S- ANALYTICAL AND HE MAKES HIS POINTS IN OUR COGNIZANT AND PERFECT WAY SO. MY MAIN OBJECTION ON THIS BILL WAS OF COURSE THE OVERRIDING OF LOCAL. PEOPLE I LIKE THE OFFICIALS SO. MY THOUGHT PROCESS WHICH SENATOR WIENER SPARKED OFF WAS OKAY LET'S ASSUME A CITY COUNCIL OVERRIDES ZONI IN EXCEPT FOR A- IF THE VOTERS ARE THAT ANGRY OKAY COME UP. IT'S CALLED DEMOCRACY SO. THAT TAKES CARE OF MY MAIN OBJECTION I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I THANK YOU SIR FOR WORKING WITH ME AD NAUSEAM HE WORKED HARD THANK YOU HELLO THANK YOU THE SUMMER VOEPEL SOME REMEMBER BLOOM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR AGREEING A LANGUAGE THAT CLARIFIES THAT THE BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES FOR. OPEN SPACE. ON THAT SAID I STILL HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT ISSUES WITH THE BILL THAT I'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE- AUTHOR AND- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I SUPPORTED LAST YEAR'S VERSION SB NINE OH TWO WITH THE UNDERSTANDING AND COMMITMENT FROM THE AUTHOR FOR TWO IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS. ONE OF THEM WAS THE OPEN SPACE ISSUE ON THE OTHER I WAS THE ONE THAT- MY- A COLLEAGUE GOT- FROM LOS ANGELES- ARE BROUGHT UP AND THAT'S THE EXEMPTION- FOR A VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES AND TO- LAST YEAR I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN A COMMITMENT TO- TO AMEND THE BILL- FOR A FULL EXEMPTION. FOR VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES AND- THAT IS NOT IN AND- THIS VERSION OF THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY- LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS A NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT OR WITHIN THOSE FIRE SEVERITY SOUNDS AGORA HILLS PACIFIC PALISADES TO PAYING A CANYON IN MALIBU TO NAME JUST A FEW OF ALL OF THESE HAVE BURNED HISTORICALLY AND IN RECENT YEARS THEY ARE COVERED WITH THOUSANDS OF HOMES WINDING STREETS AND VERY LIMITED INGRESS AND- EGRESS AND- OF COURSE WE'RE SAYING. RECORD SETTING HEAT WAVES NOW AND YEAR AFTER YEAR OF- INTENSIFYING WILDFIRE SEASONS. AND I BELIEVE THE DENSIFIED PARTS OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO DEVASTATING WILDFIRES JUST PUTS MORE PEOPLE AND MORE PROPERTY IN HARM'S WAY AND ONLY COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEMS THAT WE EXPERIENCE ALREADY WITH WILDFIRE. SO I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT SB TEN DOES NOT INCLUDE THE EXEMPTION FOR OF THE SOUNDS THIS YEAR AND I HOPE THAT- THE AUTHOR WILL CONSIDER I STILL CONSIDER ADDING THE AMENDMENT. I UNDERSTAND THAT- WESTERN CENTER THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND OTHERS HAVE RAISED CONCERNS OVER THE BILL'S POTENTIAL IMPACT ON REPLACEMENT OBLIGATIONS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO BOTH MYSELF AND THE AUTHOR AND EVERYONE HERE ON THE SET UP ON THIS COMMITTEE- AND I. HOPE THAT YOU'LL HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THESE ADVOCATE ORGANIZATIONS AND FIND A RESOLUTION TO THEIR CONCERNS BUT IN IN CONCLUSION AS THINGS STAND NOW I CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS- HE- VERY BRIEF AND JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED- AND LOOK THESE ISSUES ARE NEVER EASY AS AS WE ALL KNOW- BUT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WE MUST WORK HARD TO FIND SOME COMMON GROUND AND HOPEFULLY SOME SOLUTIONS. TO OUR HOUSING PROBLEMS IN THE STATE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT THAT INCLUDES ADDRESS SEEN OUR- QUITE CRITICALLY OVERCROWDED HOUSING. FOR ARE INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE LOW WAGE EARNERS ARE FARMWORKERS- AND SO- AND YOU KNOW ALSO I'M VERY VERY CONFIDENT AND- THE SENATORS ABILITY TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THAT- THAT- YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAPPEN AND SO- I WILL OBVIOUSLY BE SUPPORT BILL TAKES OFF. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MEDIATOR TEN MOTION SOME OF CAN WE HAVE MOTION BY SENATOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACK IS SUCKING MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS BOB WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MANAGER AND I GOT A ONE THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US- IT REALLY DOES AND THROW AWAY. MY BECAUSE I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS COMMENTARY AND IT'S REALLY HEY I ENJOY THESE DISCUSSIONS OF ANYWAYS OBVIOUSLY FOR THOSE OF US WHO DO HOUSING FOR WORKING THERE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE DO AS WELL. YOU HAVE TO ENJOY IT. AND YOU HAVE TO BE PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF ME HERE AND YOU HEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE EVERY WEEK ABOUT SYSTEM BY BILLS BUT OTHER BILLS. THAT THE VERY DIVERSE- A LOT OF SUPPORT. THE DIVERSE DIVERSE OBJECTIONS TO ANY KIND OF HOUSING ON OR WHAT KIND OF IMPACT HOUSING BILLS. ANY MEMBER LEGISLATURE DOES THAT LIKE IT COMES TO YOU FROM A LOT OF AND VERY- I'M NOT BEING DISMISSIVE RIGHT WILDFIRES AND SUPER REAL. RIGHT THESE ARE LIKE BALLOT THIS IS ALL SUPER REAL STUFF AND PEOPLE JUST BEING PASSION ABOUT THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS I LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD. TO FOR TWENTY FOUR YEARS I'M PASSION ABOUT MY NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT YOU KNOW BIG PICTURE- YOU KNOW IT IT IT BECOMES NOT SURPRISING WHY WERE IN SUCH A PROFOUND CRISIS- THE YOU KNOW THERE'S IT'S THIS CONSTANT. SORT OF. YOU KNOW WARFARE. ABOUT HOUSING. AND WE SEE THAT OUR KIDS ARE NOT. I DON'T HAVE KIDS BUT THOSE WHO DO. CAN AFFORD PLACE TO LET. ME SEE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED DURING. COVERT IT WASN'T HOUSING DENSITY.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE CREDIT FOR WORKING WITH US I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. TO SP FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT- SB FOUR SEVEN EIGHT IS A IT'S A VERY TECHNICAL MONKEY BILL IT'S ALSO BASICALLY GOVERNMENT BILL. WHAT IS BEFORE SEVEN EIGHT DISS ENSURE THAT- TO BE CLEAR SB FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT DOES NOT CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT LOCAL ZONES DENSITY THE NUMBER OF UNITS THE HYPE THE SETBACK. THE DESIGN THOSE ARE ALL LOCAL DECISIONS ON THE FOUR SEVENTY EIGHT WHAT IT DOES IS PROVIDE THAT IF ITS CITY LOCALLY THE SIDES TO ZONE FOR SMALL MULTI UNIT BETWEEN THREE AND TEN UNITS IS NO IMPACT ON SINGLE FAMILY OR EVEN DUPLEX ON IT. BUT IF THE CITY DECIDES HIS OWN LOCALLY FOR THREE TO TEN UNITS. THE CITY ACTUALLY HAS TO LET PEOPLE BUILD TO THAT LOCAL LOCALLY DECIDED HIS OWN DENSITY RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A SUBSET OF CITIES. THAT ON PAPER ZONE FOR FOUR UNITS ARE FIVE UNITS OR SIX UNITS BUT THEN THEY USE THE CONCEPT OF FLOOR AREA RATIO F. A. R. WHICH IS EFFECTIVELY A SQUARE FOOTAGE COP. TO SAY WELL WE KNOW WE DOING THIS FOR FOUR UNITS IN OUR HOUSING ELEMENT AND ARE PLANNING CODE. BUT WE'RE GOING TO CAP YOUR SQUARE FOOTAGE AT NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET BECAUSE OF A RESTRICTIVE FIR. AND SO NINE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET DIVIDED BY FOUR IS TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE SQUARE FEET PER UNIT IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BUILT- IT'S- CENTER HERTZBERG TWENTY SUPPORT IN THE SENATE REFERRED TO IT AS THE TRUTH IN ZONING. LAW PREVENTS CITIES FROM GIVING WITH ONE HAND TAKING- WITH THE OTHER- BY PROVIDING THAT IF YOU JONES. FROM THREE TO SEVEN UNITS CFTR CANNOT BE LOWER THAN ONE POINT NO- OR EIGHT TO TEN UNITS OF CAPITAL IN THE ONE POINT TWO FIVE WE BASE THESE ON WHAT YOU WHAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY ALLOWING. THOSE BUILDINGS ARE TO BE A BILL THAT BILL ALSO ENSURES THAT IF THE CITY HAS A MINIMUM LOT SIZES WE DON'T OVERRIDE. THOSE BUT IF THEIR PREVIOUS LEE EXISTING. LEGAL LAW OF DON'T THE KERR MINIMUM LOTS. OF THE BILL. THAT YOU CAN'T JUST TELL PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BUILD FOR WHAT ZONES ON THAT LOT- SO COLLEAGUES THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT TODAY.
