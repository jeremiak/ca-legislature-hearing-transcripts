BUT FROM THAT STUDY THEY SHOW THAT THERE'S AN ESTIMATED ITS WANT ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE TO ONE UNDER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DIGITS MIGRANTS LIVING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE MAJORITY OF THESE FOLKS HAD HELP FROM SOUTHERN MEDICAL. AND BETWEEN 5840250% OF THE FARMWORKERS AND THE CITY CALIFORNIA ARE INDIGENOUS AND THEN SPEAK THEIR INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES THAT INCLUDE MIX THAT GOALS UP WITH THAT GOAL PUT IT BETCHA. FREAKY OR TO ME NOW WHAT. AND MANY MANY MORE. ON THESE. LANGUAGES ARE SEPARATE UNTO THEMSELVES AND UNLIKE SPANISH AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE SEE IN OUR LINE OF WORK IS THAT ARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM MEXICO. GET LOCKED IN THE SPANISH SPEAKERS SO TRADITIONAL WAYS OF. REACHING OUT TO SPANISH SPEAKERS JUST DON'T WORK FOR OUR FOLKS. ARE INDIGENT MY COMMUNITY HAVE LOW LITERACY LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE ORAL NATURE OF THEIR LANGUAGES. AND WE LAKE SECTOR PRETTY MENTIONED. A WE ALSO CUT ACROSS DIFFERENT HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS OF CHILDREN WE HAVE MANY CHILDREN AGED ZERO TO FIVE. LOW BROADBAND AREAS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. RENTERS IMMIGRANT STATUS AND MORE. AND WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THROUGH THIS WORK I WITH THE SENSES THAT THERE ARE OTHER. POCKETS A FARMWORKERS INCLUDING PUNJABI. LONG OR THE SPEAKERS THAT WE FEEL WE CAN APPLY THE SAME STRATEGIES AT IT IN TERMS OF. OUT REACH. SO DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS MY TIME HAS BEEN SPENT SETTING THE GROUNDWORK FOR OUR SENSES WORK. BY ATTENDING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WORKSHOPS AND BAKERSFIELD. FRESNO SALINAS. AND SANTA ROSA I'VE BEEN ON TOUR THIS IS ALSO PART OF. SO THESE WORKSHOPS TO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INTERFACE WITH FOLKS ON THE GROUND GIVEN THAT WERE SO SPECIFIC TO ENTER IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. TO LEARN FOR-THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND HERE WHAT THIS ISSUES ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH REGION. PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN HAS A THREE PRONGED APPROACH TO ALREADY HEARD HIGH TOUCH BOOTS ON THE GROUND. BUT THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS A RADIO GAME. SO AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE A COMMUNITY BASED LOW POWER RADIO STATION PROBABLY WHEN THEY CAN NOW. AND WE ENVISION OUR COMMUNITY BASED RADIO STATION MUCH LIKE THE OTHER TWENTY BASED RADIO STATIONS TO CALIFORNIA. TO BE USED AS AN AGGRESSIVE OUR RITUAL TO PUSH MESSAGING CONTENT INTO CREE ATTITUDINAL CHANGE ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY. TWENTY. I'M CURRENTLY OUR VIDEO STATION IS PLAYED. AND AGRICULTURE FEELS THEREOF AND TERRA AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. AND WE USE AS A VEHICLE TO GET A CRUCIAL INFORMATION SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN OUR AREA WAS HIT BY THE THOMAS FIRE. WE'RE USING THAT TO PUSH OUT EVACUATION NOTICES. THE IMPORTANCE OF IN ANY FIVE MASKS AND SO MUCH MORE. HOW WE CURRENTLY HOST FORTY HOURS OF LIVE ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING. AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF HOURS APPROVED COURTED PSAS. SO WE SEEK TO UTILIZE OUR PRODUCTION EXPERT. EASE OF PSAS. TO WORK WITH THE AT THE NEW CONTRACT MEDIA PARTNER. I'M TO PUSH OUT INFORMATION AND MESSAGES THAT ARE TAILORED TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND OF THESE PSA WILL BE RECORDED IN SPANISH MAKES THAT GOES UP WITH MICHAEL ENGLISH. WHAT ABOUT GENTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT CONCEPTS CONSISTENT AND ENTER. THE MESSAGING THROUGH PSAS GIVES THE- TRINITY TO ENGAGE IN AUDIO. AND FORMALLY. WITHOUT THEM ACTIVELY SEEKING OR AND REALIZED THAT THEY'RE BEING INFORMED. FOR EXAMPLE WE ALSO RUN OUT OF THE AND ALL THE ON BREAST CANCER. COMMENTS BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST A WILL. ENGAGE FOLKS. AGAIN MY ANOTHER BAY IS NOT RATE OF FIRE. SO FOR THIS IT'S A DRIP DRIP METHOD THAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING. AND WE FOUND THAT IT'S- BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET INFORMATION OUT ALSO TO FOLKS LEVEL. WILL EDUCATION ATTAINMENT. AND WE ALSO VISION IS PSAS NOT LIMITED TO A RADIO STATION BUT BEING PLAYED IN PLACES LIKE AMBULATORY CAN. CLINICS FOR THE COUNTY. HUMAN SERVICES. AGENCY OFFICES IT'S FOR ALL REALLY. RADIO AND RADIO PROGRAMMING LIKE IT AS A WAY TO. CHANGE ATTITUDES ON THAT UNLESS THE YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO INVITE REPRESENTATIVES SO FOLKS IN YOUR OFFICES FOLKS FROM THE COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE EVEN BOOKS IN THE FEDERAL CENSUS BUREAU TO HAVE A PRESENCE ON RADIO. SKIPPING. AND JUST WANTING TO ALSO REALLY REITERATE YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH OUR FOLKS HAVE YOU KNOW LITERACY RATES THERE ON SOCIAL MEDIA THEIR KIDS MAKE THEIR FACEBOOK ACCOUNT THERE WHAT'S UP ACCOUNT. AND SO THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER READ PLEASE THE YOU CAN PUSH AUDIO AND VISUALS. OUT TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE DO A RADIO BROADCAST OUT OF THE AND THEY CAN I WE ALSO PUT IT ON FACEBOOK SO IT'S RECORDED AND PEOPLE CAN COME BACK TO IT THEY CAN RE SHARE IT THEY CAN LIKE IT. AND SO ALSO A REALLY GLAD THAT A FRIEND AND ON A COUPLE TOUCH ON ON THIS PIECE YOU KNOW WE ARE CAN A COMMUNITY BASED RADIO STATION IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE A COMMERCIAL RADIO STATION. SO ALSO THE PUSH FOR FUNDING TO COME IN AND SUPPORT THAT WORK AS WELL WE SEE OUR FUNDING REALLY AS GOING TOWARDS THE GROUND GAME AND SO WE REALLY NEED BOTH. AIR AND GROUND TO COMPLIMENT ONE EACH OTHER AT THE COMPLETE COUNT. HERE THROUGHOUT THE I. P. W'S I REPEATEDLY HEARD THE PHRASE TRUSTED MESSENGER AND LIKE WHAT IS TRUST AS MESSENGER REALLY MEAN AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THESE COMMUNITY RADIO STATIONS PROVIDING UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY. AS A TRUSTED MANAGER ASKED SOMETHING THAT FOLKS TUNE INTO DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IT'S NOT LOST ON US THAT MY COP AND ON THE ON THE KING OF THE NEED TO AFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING. A COMMUNITIES INFORMATION AS IT RELATES TO THE ANSWER. TEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. AND THAT'S NOT TRUST THE WERE. READILY GOING TO SQUANDER. WE REALIZE THIS IS IMPORTANT IT'S YOU FOLKS HERE I COMMITTEE. AT US AS A STATEWIDE CONTRACTOR. IS THE PILOT THAT'LL THAT'S PUSHING ICE CREAM AND IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL OF US TO GET A COMPLETE COUNCIL THANK YOU. THANK YOU I THANK ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS ARE THE PRESENTATIONS NOW QUESTS QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY YES SOME EVER RANDALL SO FIRST IF I CAN JUST GO THROUGH THE SEQUENCE OF PRESENTERS AND JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS I THOUGHT YOU SAID QUITE WELL AND SOMETIMES READER REITERATING IT BACK ACTUALLY WILL ALLOW THAT MESSAGE TO BE HEARD A SECOND TIME. I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE CONFIDENTIALITY AND MAKE THIS PRACTICAL AND IMPACTFUL AND WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT A FRIEND. JONATHAN TREND YOUR COMMENTS REGARDING LONG RADIO AND THE WORK THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS NOT LOST ON ME FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES WHO WORKS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT IS A VERY GOOD ADVOCATE FOR THIS AND I HOPE YOU CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH TO MAKE SURE THAT. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FORGOTTEN GET INCLUDED BUT I WANTED AND WITH MY COP IF I COULD BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT I'VE DONE WITH YOU IN THE PAST HOW CAN WE HELP DRAW THE IN THE HINA EXPAND TO RODEO BILLING WAY ARE THERE WAYS WE CAN SHARE PLATFORM SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY. IS THAT ARE MORE WORLD GET ACCESS. WHY I'M GETTING TO IT IS REPRESENTING A RURAL COMMUNITY IT'S THE RIGHT MEDIUM IT'S WHERE PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR IN THEIR CARS LISTENING TO THE RADIO. AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT TRUSTED MESSENGER. THAT WAS THE POINT TO ME. THAT WAS THE STRONGEST. IT'S NOT THE MESSAGES TO MESSENGER. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT TO STAY GROUNDED IN THAT SO THAT WE HIRE THE RIGHT TALENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A COMPLETE CAM. I CAN RESPOND REALLY QUICKLY SO PART OF WHAT I CUT OUT WAS MENTIONING ABOUT THE OF THE LANGUAGE ACTUALLY RATHER WILL INCREASE. THE EXECUTOR TO LIMÃ³N ELLIS WAS THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE YOU IN THE CAN A SO WE DO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM AND KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A NETWORK OF FOURTEEN OTHER. COMMUNITY RADIO STATION THAT SETS THEM IS RATHER COMPASS CENA IT'S OUR RADIO STATION LONG RADIO THING PUT JOBY ONE A ONE ARE OF USA ONE A ONE IT'S ALL THESE RADIO STATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO COME TOGETHER TO DO THE WORK. ON MY DAD WENT TO COLLEGE TOGETHER OKAY. NO HIS TWIN KIDS AND SO HE'S A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AND AGAIN ANOTHER TRUSTED. WHO BECAME THE APPOINTS ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK. THANK YOU YES SIR DORADO. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. YOU CAN NEED ALL THREE OF YOU TO ANSWER A AND THANK YOU FOR ON ALL OF YOUR WORK HAVE YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY EXAMPLES OF HOW YOU THINK AND PARTICULARLY THE HARD THESE HARD TO COUNT. REALLY REALLY HARD TO COUNT. ARE THERE ARE YOU FINDING WAYS THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THESE CAN BE USED TO FILL OUT THE CENSUS FORM. AND TO HAVE YOU FOUND THE CORD NATION. I KNOW TO DO THIS WORKS EXTREMELY HARD AT THIS AND SHE REALLY BELIEVES IN IT BUT HAVE YOU FOUND SUFFICIENT COORDINATION. AMONGST ALL OF VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THIS WORK OR DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS FOR. OTHER WAYS THAT WE COULD FURTHER YOU KNOW DO THIS. I CAN I CAN SHARE SOME REALLY QUICK AND BRIEF EXAMPLES TO RESPOND PLANNED AND BITE MY PEERS TO DO SO AS WELL SO. FIRST I THINK IN TERMS OF THE ACCORD NATION PEACE JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. PART OF THE PART OF THE CHALLENGES THE GEOGRAPHY RIGHT FOUR THOUSAND SQUARE MILES EIGHTY EIGHT DIFFERENT CITIES. SO THE WORK THERE HAS REALLY BEEN LOCALIZED THROUGH A SET OF WHAT WE CALL REGIONAL TABLES WHICH MEET ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WHICH I THINK CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW ARE MAXING OUT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TOTAL ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING. AND WHAT THEY DO THERE'S THROUGH AN AGENDA THEY LINK UP THE AS SOON TO FIRST ALL SHARE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE DIFFERENT CORNERS OF THE COUNTY. AND THEY BREAK AWAY AND THEY ALL PLANNED LOCALLY AND SORT OF IDENTIFY WHO'S DOING WHAT WHO'S GOT WHAT RESOURCES AND WHAT ARE WE DOING. OP THAT THAT'S JUST BEEN HAPPENING FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND WHAT AND THAT. ALSO BE GRANTS AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE GAVE I'VE GIVEN US A VIEW OF. EACH ORGANIZATION THAT APPLIED SHARED WHAT REGION'S THEY HAVE STRENGTH IN AND WHERE THEY WILL BE DOING WORK AND THAT'S ALLOWED US TO START TO SEE WHO ARE IN THE JOBS THAT WE MAKE SURE CONNECTING. AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE WHAT THEY'RE WORK WORK LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS. OF AN EXAMPLE A PRACTICAL WAY AND. IS IT. VERY PLAIN TERMS OF REACHING THE HARD TO COUNT IS GONNA BE THAT. THERE'S NOT ONE SINGLE MEDIUM SOCIAL MEDIA IS CRITICAL AND WE CAN'T REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE'RE ALL CITING. THE FACT THAT THIS IS A DIGITAL FIRST SENT TO THAT THE CHALLENGE. FOR MANY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IT COULD BE TURNED INTO AN ASSET BECAUSE THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME DOWNLOADING VIDEO ON MOBILES AND SO AS LONG AS THIS APP. FOR THE FORM IS MOBILE FRIENDLY I THINK IT COULD BE AN ASSET AND THE KEY THING IS TO REMEMBER THAT. ARE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE MIXED STATUS AND SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING TO THE PARENT WERE TALKING TO THEIR NIECES AND NEPHEWS TO THE KIDS THAT ACTUALLY NAVIGATE. A LOT OF THESE ISSUES FOR THEM AND WILL NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE GEARING THE IMAGES AND THINGS THAT THEY SEATED MAKE THIS BE A FAMILY PEACE THOSE ARE JUST SOME VERY. IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT WERE SEEN. ARE JUST REALLY QUICKLY TWO THOUGHTS ON THAT I THINK ONE OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM. THE WORK THAT WE DID AROUND ENROLLMENT DURING THE ACA WAS TO BE ABLE TO COORDINATE OUR P. MEDIA STRATEGY WITH IN REAL LIFE ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS THAT ULTIMATELY. ARE PAID MEDIA DOLLARS NEED TO BE DRIVING PEOPLE TO SUPPORT ON THE GROUND. AND TO HELP THE HARDEST PART IS. TOCOUNT POPULATIONS GET. THE TANGIBLE SUPPORT TO FILL OUT THE CENSUS FORM AND SO A LOT OF FOLKS TALK ABOUT. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE I THINK ACT ACTUALLY DIGITAL LITERACY COMPONENT. AND SO GETTING FOLKS TO THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IS CRITICAL THE OTHER THING WE LEARNED FROM THE FOCUS GROUP TESTING IS THAT WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE MORE EFFECTIVE TALK ABOUT THE SENSES BY NOT TALKING ABOUT THE SENTENCE. TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE CARE THE MOST THAT IMPACT THEM THE MOST SO. FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL IS WORKING WITH. CLINICS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE HIGHLIGHTING THE SENSES BECAUSE ULTIMATELY FOR THE HARDEST ACCOUNT POPULATIONS THAT'S GOING TO BE THE ENTRY POINT. TO TALK ABOUT THE CRITICAL ISSUES THAT IMPACT THEM AND THEN ULTIMATELY HOLDING IN. A MESSAGE. FLANK THAT LIGHT SENSES MESSAGE ON TOP OF THAT. YEAH I MEAN WE- PART OF PART OF WHAT WE SEEK TO DO IS ALSO USING OUR PROMOTE A MODEL THAT WE ALREADY USE AND TERMS OF TRUST AND MESSENGERS FOLKS WERE FROM COMMUNITY SPEAK THE LANGUAGE ARMING THEM LITTLE TABLETS AND YES I WAS GAY YOU HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE SENSES THIS IS HAT IT IS AND KIND OF GETTING THEM YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DOING THERE ARE WHICH FOR OTHER PROGRAMS YOU KNOW HAVING YES IT IS INFORMATION AND KNOW YOUR RIGHTS FORMS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME FOR THAT SEE OF FOLKS IN THE DOOR THE NO YOU'RE RIGHT. AND THEN WELL AS THEY LEAVE WILL HELP THEM WITH THE CENSUS WORK RIGHT AND AGAIN GIVEN THAT OUR FAMILIES DO HAVE LOW LITERACY AND IT'S YOU KNOW ONLINE MAKING THAT PHONE CALL IN A WITH THE FAMILY AND SUPPORTING THEM THAT WAY AND THERE ARE SOME WAYS THAT WE SEE US SUPPORTING. HANDS ON OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN FILLING OUT THE CENSUS. THANK YOU. TERRIBLE ALRIGHT THANK YOU THE SENATE BENT COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS MISS FLORES HARO YOU'D MENTIONED NUMBER OF INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES I WOULD ATTEMPT TO PRONOUNCE THEM WHAT DO A ROUGH ESTIMATE AS TO HOW MANY MONOLINGUAL SPEAKERS OF THOSE INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE EXISTING CALIFORNIA I REALIZE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE SENSES AND HELP THEM BUT YEAH BUT JUST AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THAT'S HARD TO SAY AND THAT'S HARD TO SAY IF ONLY BECAUSE SOMETIMES OUR FOLKS DON'T SELF IDENTIFY AS BEING INDIGENOUS SO THEY DON'T SELF IDENTIFY AND THAT'S- REDING OF THE WHOLE OF THE HEARING ON LIKE COLONIALS ATION INTERRELATION IMPERIALISM AND ALL THAT. BUT I COULD GIVE YOU REST ROUGH ESTIMATES YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF INTER COUNTY WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY COUNTY IS A LITTLE BIGGER TWENTY NINE TO LIKE THIRTY SOME THOUSAND AND IT JUST REALLY DEPENDS ON THE GROUP SO THE MYSTICAL GROUPS ARE MORE MONOLINGUAL VERSES THAT POLITICAL MORE BILINGUAL IN THE OF A US THE SIZEABLE AMOUNT IS UP WITH THAT GO AND SOUTH LA. FOR EXAMPLE SO REALLY JUST DEPENDS ON THE GROUP AND OTHERS PUT IT PENSIONS AND COACHELLA VALLEY THEY LOOK. MORE BILINGUAL SO IT REALLY JUST DEPENDS. OKAY. SOUNDS LIKE A LAWYER IT DEPENDS BUT IN ANY EVENT. IS IT LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU THINK MONOLINGUAL INDIGENOUS LANGUAGE SPEAKERS SOMETHING I'M JUST I'M REALLY. LOOKING FOR A ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE YEAH YOU KNOW I THAT I DON'T KNOW. THE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF STUDIES ON IT WE WERE PART OF A STUDY THIS YEAR ON STUDYING THE LANGUAGES AND SO THOSE RESULTS ARE JUST COMING OUT. BUT AGAIN IT IT DEPENDS BECAUSE EITHER BILINGUAL SOMETIMES EVEN TRACK WITH THE U. THE TRILINGUAL WHICH IS GREAT BUT MONOLINGUAL IT'S HARD TO SAY. IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE WAVE TO AS WELL WHAT WE SAW IN THE NINETIES. HIGHER OF. PERCENTAGES OF MIT MONOLINGUAL INDIGENT SPEAKERS. AND THEN QUESTIONS TRYING. IS IT I TAKE YOUR POINT ABOUT THE SORT OF MICRO MESSAGING THAT THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE POINTS YOU WERE MAKING. WHICH WOULD MILITATE AGAINST SORT OF DOING A BRANDING KIND OF COKE KIND OF. THAT'S THE GOOD THE BEVERAGE OF TALK ABOUT. THE OF THE SORT OF SORT OF A CAMPAIGN SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT BROADCAST TV IT WOULD NOT BE VERY USEFUL OR BROADCAST RADIO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IS THAT ACCURATE I WOULD SAY IT'S YES AND I THINK YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED BOTH IN TERMS OF CREATING THE SOUTH SURROUND SOUND TO DO THE ONE A ONE EDUCATION ABOUT THE CENSUS. BUT TO GET TO THE HEART IS THE HARDEST REACH POPULATIONS I THINK YOU'RE GONNA NEED MUCH MORE TAILORED LANGUAGE DIRECTED AT THOSE POPULATION SO YEAH SO I WOULD SAY IT'S A YES AND CONVERSATION RATHER THAN EITHER OR IF I HAD A BITE PRIORITY LIKE IN TERMS OF WHERE I'M INVESTING RESOURCES RIGHT I WOULD. AND HISTORICALLY UNFORTUNATELY THAT THE TARGETED IN NARAL APPROACH IS NOT BEEN THE CASE RIGHT SO YOU LOOK AT THE CASE WE COVER CALIFORNIA THAT WAS NOT THE STRATEGY. WILL HELP THE PARENTS THE POIGNANT READ THEY WERE NOT TARGETING THESE MONOLINGUAL OR SMALLER POPULATIONS AND THERE WERE CONSEQUENCES FOR THAT RIGHT SO I THINK A LESSON LEARNED IS LIKE REALLY TAYLOR THOSE MESSAGES FROM A VISUAL STANDPOINT I THANK YOU BOTH THE RIGHT LIKE YOU CAN ATTACH. AND GEO TARGET TO THE EXTREME IN TERMS OF. LIKE HITTING THOSE POPULATION SO THAT THE ABSENT. OKAY WELL WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED WE HAVE RIGHT TO RESET BUT NOT UNLIMITED RESOURCES SO OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AS WELL SO. FIRST OF ALL ACTUALLY FROM A SLUR SORROW. IN TERMS OF WELL WHAT WE WHAT WE THINK ABOUT MEDIA RIGHT BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE WRITTEN YOU CAN HAVE AUDIO VISUAL AYE AYE VISUAL TOGETHER AND- WE DO HAVE POPULATIONS NATIVE POPULATIONS OTHER PPULATIONS WHO REALLY. YOU KNOW COMMUNICATE. WITH NOT MAINLY THROUGH NON WRITTEN MEANS RIGHT AT SOMETIMES WE CREATE WRITTEN THAT BUT REALLY FILES THAT'S THAT'S CONNECTS PEOPLE DON'T DON'T REALLY READ THEIR LANGUAGE. SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE. HUSH WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF. OUTREACH STRATEGIES WE SHOULD PARTICULARLY PURSUE FOR THOSE POPULATIONS AND PERHAPS MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER PRESENTERS MIGHT HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO IT JUST. PROTECT YOUR TERMS OF IT GET IT GET THAT COMES OUT THE TARGETING AND A TAILORING BUT DOUBTS SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET A LITTLE OVER RELIANCE ON OKAY WOULD WILL DEVELOP A FLYER. OR SOMETHING RIGHT YEAH I KNOW IT DID ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE. PICTORIAL NOVELLAS AS WELL WILL COME INTO PLAY I THINK HAVING A REALLY STRONG WITH VISUAL MESSAGING. IN TERMS OF THIS IS A LOGO OF SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROMOTE OR IN FRONT OF YOU LIKE YOU SEE THIS IMAGE YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS WHAT THIS IS FOR ITS FOR THE CENSUS YOU KNOW THAT IT'S SAFE. YOU KNOW THAT ME FROM MY COOPER FROM YOU KNOW CENTRALLY NACIONALES CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE ARE TELLING YOU THAT THIS IS AN OKAY IMAGINE SO WHENYOU SEE THIS IMAGE TO TRUST THIS IMAGE. AND HAVING THAT GO ALONG WITH THE PATROL STORY NO IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WHERE PARENTS THEN STAN A. B. D. HAVE ON SO WHAT WE ADVOCATED FOR TEACHERS IF THEY HAD A MYSTICAL SPEAKING PARENT. OF GREEN IS GOOD YELLOW THEY NEED WORK IN RED IS YOU KNOW NOT GREAT. YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER THING IN THE SPACES THAT WE'VE BEEN AND AS MY CALL WITH REGARDS TO THE SENSES MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER IS DEVELOPED IS DEVELOPED. AT A SECOND GRADE LEVEL OR LOWER BECAUSE THAT YOU CAN GET REALLY LOST IN THE NEW ONES AS OF THAT AND SO MAKE SURE THAT IT SENSIBLE. IN TERMS OF LEVEL IF YOU KNOW IF THE GATE WAS IN SPANISH THAT IS JUST NOT. POSSIBLE GRADE LEVEL FOR FROM TO REACH REGARDLESS OF THE LANGUAGE. WE HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED LANGUAGES SPOKEN AND YOU START TO ADD THAT UP. FACING SOME VERY SIMILAR CHALLENGES CHARACTER BASED LANGUAGES AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW SOUNDS GREAT TYPE LANGUAGES AND SO. IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A NUMBER IN LA COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR PEOPLE. IN LA COUNTY ARE IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT SPEAKS A LANGUAGE. OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND SO IT'S A PRETTY LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS. AND I THINK WHEN IT GOES WHEN IT GETS TOWARDS. HOW WE DELIVER INFORMATION HOW WE DO THAT. I THINK IT'S NOT. I THINK PROBABLY WHATWE'RE ADVOCATING FOR IS THAT IF YOU HAVE A TOTAL BUCKET OF DOLLARS. AND YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE HARDEST TO REALLY MOVE. HAVE ALL THESE CHALLENGES ARE VERY BIG LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE. AND VERY STRONGLY CONNECT TO MEDIA THAT REFLECTS OUR CULTURE. WE SHOULD MAKE THE HEAVIEST INVESTMENT THERE. AND THEN TRY TO PROVIDE THE OVER ARCHING. YOU KNOW GENERAL MARKET INVESTMENT. THERE BUT- TRADITIONALLY WE'VE DONE THE OPPOSITE WE'VE INVESTED 10% OF THE BUDGET. IN THE HARDEST TO REACH PEOPLE. AND NINETY PERCENT. ON THE SNAZZY REALLY COOL LOOKING THING. TO NORMALIZE THE CENSUS. SO I'M I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT A CULTURAL ASPECT. ENTER PAN TO YOUR POINT IT'S ABOUT A CULTURAL ASPECT AND MAKING SURE IT'S EMBEDDED AND THINGS. AND THEN ANOTHER QUESTION. AND PRY ALSO ASK IF THE FOLLOWING PANEL BUT- SO YOU KNOW THE CENSUS IS ACTUALLY FEDERAL ACTIVITY SO WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY AND THE STATE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS SO. THE FEDS ARE GOING TO DO THEIR OWN. MEDIA PLAN OF SOME SORT. WE WON'T HAVE VERY MUCH SAY IN THAT I THINK SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE THAT. FLOATING OVER. SO IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL YOU KNOW MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION OTHER TYPES OF MESSAGING WE HAVE DURING PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGNS OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITIES GOING ON THAT MAY. BE PEOPLE MORE OR LESS WILLING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO A STRANGER. WE WILL ALSO HAVE A FEDERAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN. HOW DO YOU SEE THE STATE. TAILORING ITS CAMPAIGN IN RELATION TO THE FEDERAL CAMPAIGN AND THEN OF COURSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE STATE AND DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES BUT THEN WE ALSO OF THIS FEDERAL CAMPAIGN TO I MEAN. THAT'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE WHETHER WE COORDINATE WITH THAT OR NOT WHETHER WE'RE IN SYNC WITH THAT ARE NOT YOU KNOW WE COULD CREATE CONFUSION OF OR NOT. SO DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT FOR ON THE GROUND AND MAYBE THE PEOPLE JUST IGNORE IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO. DISCONNECTED FROM THEM I DON'T KNOW SO I'D END UP WITH YOU ANY THOUGHTS TO YOUR SURVEYS OUR FOCUS GROUPS OR SO FORTH WE'RE GONNA GET MESSAGING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S. ON CENSUS. WHERE SHOULD THE STATE POSITION ITSELF RELATION TO THAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YEAH I THINK IN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE EARLY CONTENT THAT'S COME OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT FEELS PRETTY AGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF THEIR APPROACH TO THE CENSUS WRITING HAT. FOR THE MOST PART THE CONTENT COMING FROM TO THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS NOT BEEN NEGATIVE RIGHT OR HAD I NOT BEEN FILLED WITH ITS INFORMATION CREDIT TO THE I KNOW ANYWAY AND PAY THAT I WANT. AND I WILL BE VERY CLEAR BECAUSE YEAH I WAS WATCHING I HAVEN'T I AM NOT ACCUSING VERY WAS. OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF DOING THAT THERE ARE OTHER ACTORS THAT A VERY INVOLVED THAT SO I HAVE NO GOOD AND THAT'S NOT MY CONCERN BUT THE US CENSUS WILL DECIDE ON A MEDIA STRATEGY. THEY'LL PLAY A MEDIA STRATEGY THAT'S BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND POTENTIALLY CHALLENGE THE PENNY OF WHAT STRATEGY THEY PICKING WHETHER THAT SEEMS RESONATOR NOT BUT IT WILL BE OUT THERE. WRITING BUT NOT THIS INFORMATION SHOULD BE IN ALL THE CENSUSES PART RIGHT YEAH I THINK I WOULD. I WOULD TAKE THE LANDS OF LOOKING AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF I DON'T THINK FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE RIGHT WHERE THE MESSAGE IS COMING FROM RIGHT. WHAT IS GOING TO RESONATE WITH FOLKS IS HOW MUCH THEY TRUST THE PERSON TELLING THEM ONE AND THEN TO. I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE POINT ABOUT LIKE IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE MESSENGER SO I THINK THE STATE'S INVESTMENT NEEDS TO BE REALLY TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THOSE MESSENGERS TO BE BEAT REALLY. SPEARHEADING THE EFFORT. ON THE COMMUNICATIONS AND BECAUSE I. LIKE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO TELL UNTIL THE END OF THE AD WILL WEAR THE LABEL LIKE WHAT. WHAT LOGO YOU THROUGH ON THERE LIKE IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR FOLKS TO DIFFERENT. I THINK. AND PROVIDE FOR MY UNDERSTANDING CORRECT ME ANYONE FROM WRONG BUT I THINK IT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TRYING TO ACQUIRE THE COUNT VON COUNT FROM SESAME STREET. OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT AND SO IT'S A VERY. BROAD KIND OF IMAGE WHICH IS LIKE AND THE TAILORING OF THIS BUT THIS SEMESTER THAT WE'VE BEEN MENTIONING HERE. AT THIS PANEL SO. JUST A OKAY TERRA BURKE. QUICK FOLLOW UP THE AND I TAKE YOUR POINTS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE MORE OF CALLED MICRO MESSAGING VERSUS SORT OF THE GENERIC BROADCAST TV KIND OF THING THAT THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE OUR COLLEAGUES WILL SAY WE'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ON MEDIA AND I HAVEN'T SEEN A FACEBOOK AD THAT APPEARS ON MY COMPUTER I HAVE WELL I YOU KNOW IT WHEN I WATCH YOU KNOW SEAN HANNITY I DON'T SEE. ADDS CONCERNING THE SENSES ON FOX OR WHATEVER. THAT'S OKAY BUT IT A MINUTE I'M NOT BEING FACETIOUS IT DOES CREATE A CHALLENGE FOR US BECAUSE OF WE'RE DOING THESE MICRO MESSAGES. SOME OF US WON'T WON'T QUITE SEE THEM SO WE'LL NEED TO DO. THAT FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE OUR MONEY IS WELL SPENT THAT THAT THAT MEANS THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO A GOOD JOB. OF DEMONSTRATING TO OUR COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS IN LEADERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE WE ARE ACTUALLY. DELIVERING THE MESSAGE AND HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS SO I BECAUSE MY SECOND POINT. AND BESIDES TRANSPARENCY THAT'S ACCOUNTABILITY. CONTINUING ACCOUNTABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT WE'RE GETTING. HILL CONTACT OR SOME SORT OF. SOME SOME SORT BANG FOR OUR BUCK SO THANK YOU THREE. I WOULD THAT'S WHAT THE SWORD DATABASE WILL COME INTO PLAY IN TERMS OF LIKE THE TOUCHES AND THAT'S SOMETHING THOSE ARE NUMBERS THAT ARE TANGIBLE AND REAL THAT COULD BE SHOWN I'VE NOT GONNA PRETEND I'M AN EXPERT ON THE WHOLE PLATFORM BUT- BUT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY REFER TO AS WELL. THANK I'D SAY NO OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS I KNOW IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING THE TAKE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND FINISH SORT OF OUT OF TIME BUT THIS IS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT ONE THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTING HERE SO NOW FOR OUR FORCED HIM TO TURN IT OVER TO. SENATOR AND CHAIR OF BURKE. THANK YOU SELF FOR THE OVERVIEW OF STATE SINCE COMMUNICATION EFFORTS AND HOW THE STATE'S MEDIA CONTRACTOR WILL REACH THE HARD TO COUNT POPULATION WE HAVE MISSED.

AND WE'RE EXCITED. TO WELCOME. THEM TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO INTEGRATE OUR GROUND EFFORTS AND ENSURE THAT WE REACH THE HARDEST OF HARDEST ACCOUNTS. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO PASS IT OFF TO MARTHA DOMINGUEZ TO DISCUSS THE STATE'S COMMUNICATION EFFORTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THE BIGGEST. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING AS SOME JUST GONNA WRITE DIED BEEN INTO MINE TALKING POINTS AND- FIRST OF ALL WE JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT YOU WERE AWARE THAT WE'RE FULLY COMPETENT TO AND FULLY EQUIPPED TO GUIDE DIRECT IN SUPPORT STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN OF THIS CALIBER. TO REACH THE HISTORICALLY UNDER COUNTER COMMUNITIES. OUR ABILITY TO PLAN DESIGN DISSEMINATED EVALUATE EFFECTIVE SOCIAL CULTURAL COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN FOR THE BASE AND ADOPTING INTEGRATED THEORIES. EVIDENCE BASED MODEL STRATEGIES TO DELIVER AND DESIGN INFORM INFLUENCE AND PERSUADE THE TARGET AUDIENCE IN. PARTICULAR TO SOME ACTION EVERY AT ASPECT. THAT JUST COMPLETELY IN THAT SENSE AS TWENTY TWENTY FORM. WE'RE FOLLOWING OUR BEST PRACTICES AND WE'RE SHARING THESE WITH MERCURY AND THEY HAVE IT EMBRACE THEM AND THEIR BREEDING THEM INTO THEIR EFFORTS. IS TO USE RESEARCH BASED STRATEGIES AND APPROACHES FROM DATA FOR ME TO RESEARCH TO SHAPE. AND DESIGN THE MESSAGING MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS AND TO SELECT THE CHANNELS TO DELIVER IT THE IDEA ON THE MESSAGES TO THE TARGET AUDIENCE. WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND LEARN AND COMMUNICATE WITH VARIOUS CULTURES AND COMMUNITIES AND LEARN THEIR PRIORITIES. FROM CONVENTIONAL WISDOM IDEAS AND LANGUAGE FROM THAT IDEAS ABOUT THAT WE JUST HEARD FROM THE PANEL BEFORE. WE'RE ALSO TRYING TO INFUSE CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN AN INFORMATION ACCESS SO WE WANT TO KNOW HOW TO BEST DISSEMINATE INFORMATION NOT JUST FROM THE LETTER C. BUT ALSO AND HOW THEY WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET ACCESS OR SMARTPHONES. OR EVEN THE TYPE OF MEDIA EXPOSURE THAT THEY HAVE WERE FULLY AWARE THERE WHERE IT. IN CALIFORNIA VERY DIVERSE WERE ORAL AND LITERACY HI BUT A DIFFERENT. GAMBIT IN TERMS OF HOW INFORMATION IS ABSORBED. DEVELOPING CULTURAL INCOMPETENT PRODUCTS AND COLLATERAL MATERIALS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE FULLY INVESTED AND WE WILL BE ANALYZING. THOROUGHLY TO ENSURE THAT NOT JUST ON THE AIR GAME BUT THE TRADITIONAL MEDIA BUT ALSO THE INTERNET SOCIAL MEDIA FROM WHAT'S UP WE CHAT FAKE FACEBOOK. AND ALL THE DIFFERENT SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS THAT ARE. TRADITIONALLY UNDER REPRESENTED A COMMUNITIES UTILIZED FROM THE ONE ON ONE INTERACTIONS FROM THE BUT I'M A THOUGHT AS THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASSISTANCE CENTERS AND JUST YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. OUR NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET. I'M AND WE WOULD NOT BE SELF SUFFICIENT AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY WE WILL BE MEASURING AND EVALUATE EVERY EFFORT THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MONITOR ALL TRENDS AND EVALUATE EVERY EFFORT TO ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE THE BEST A VALUABLE INFORMATION ACROSS ALL COMMUNITIES AND CULTURES AND CALIFORNIA. WE I WANT TO GO OVER VERY BRIEFLY ON HOW WE LANDED HIM WITH MERCURY WE WENT THROUGH A VERY HIGHLY COMPETITIVE I REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. WE HAD A SENSE AS EVALUATION TEAM OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS THAT WERE ABLE TO REVIEW ALL THE PROPOSALS AND IN THAT PROCESS IT WAS DETERMINE THE MERCURY PUBLIC AFFAIRS WAS AN IDEAL PARTNER NOT JUST FOR OFFICE BUT ALSO FOR CALIFORNIA. AFTER THE NOTICE OF INTENSE WE WENT IN THROUGH CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WHEN WE REVIEWED MERCURY'S PROPOSALS. A LOT OF THE IDEAS AND DELIVERABLES MORE ENHANCE THE CENSUS OFFICE DETERMINE THAT MERCURY'S PROPOSAL PROVIDED THE BEST VALUE FOR THE STATE BOTH IN TERMS OF APPROACH AND COST. AS OF JULY TWENTY NINTH. AGREES CONTRACT WAS FULLY EXECUTED FOR FORTY SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND SINCE IT'S DAY MERCURY HAS DEMONSTRATED THE REASONS WE SELECTED AN AVID DYNAMIC AND ENERGETIC CULTURE RESPONSE A PARTNER. TO COLLABORATE WITH THE OFFICE BUT ALSO WITH CALIFORNIA. ALONG WITH MERCURY WE WILL. WE ARE READY TO EDUCATE MOTIVATE AND ACTIVATE ALL COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY THE HEART ACCOUNT COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THEY PARTICIPATE ARE EDUCATED AND WELL INFORMED AT THE CENSUS TWENTY. AND A VERY TANGIBLE AND PRACTICAL MATTER. AND THE INTROVERT TIME AS WE'RE GETTING MERCURY UP TO SPEED OUR OFFICE HAS ALSO BEEN PROVIDING OUR FUNDING PARTNERS AND LOCAL PARTNERS EVIDENCE BASED RESOURCE INFORMATION SUCH AS THIS. RESOURCE TOOL WHICH WE HAVE SHARED WITH YOU GUYS THAT HAVE STANDARDIZED MESSAGES AND THE HAS BEEN DISSEMINATED TO ENSURE CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOP A WEBSITE AND EIGHTY A COMPLIANCE TO ENSURE FUNDING PARTNERS CAN RETAIN UPDATES LATEST INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATE. VARIOUS EVENTS ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY TANGIBLE AND PRACTICAL AND ENGAGING WITH EARNED MEDIA TO ESTABLISH VARIOUS COMMUNITIES ARE THEM AND ALSO IN LONG GATOR MESSAGES ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN STABBED MACHINE VARIOUS PARTNERS AND SOME OF THE PANELS THAT YOU'VE HEARD PREVIOUS OUR OUR SOME OF OUR PARTNERS BUT ALSO TO CROSS SHARE. BEST PRACTICES FOR COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE INFORMATION TO SHARE AT VARIOUS LEVELS AND TO MEET THE CONSUMERS WHERE THEY'RE AT. SUCH AS THE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITY DOES THE DESIRE TO HAVE ORAL INFORMATION THE THOUGHT ABOUT HAVING FOUR NOVELLAS IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- LOOKING AT TWO SO WE CAN DUPLICATE ACROSS THE STATE. WE HAVE ALSO ENGAGE WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY TO AND THEY HAVE ALSO REMINDED US THE IMPORTANCE OF INCLUDING HOMELESS YOUTH AND ALSO INCLUDING THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. WE'VE ALSO BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THEY HAVE REMINDED US A CRITICAL ROLE OF FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALONG WITH PRINT MEDIA. WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY NOT ONLY DO ARE WE WERE REMINDED BUT WE HAVE ALSO ENGAGE WITH VERY IS IMMIGRANT AND DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE'RE REMINDED AT THAT HOW DIVERSE OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE. NOT JUST FROM MEXICO OR CENTRAL AMERICA BUT ALSO FROM AFRICA ASIA AND RUSSIA. OUR PARTNERS HAVE EQUIPPED AS WITH THE COMMUNITY GATEKEEPERS TO ENSURE MESSAGES CAN BE DISSEMINATED CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE WE WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE ACROSS THE CAMPAIGN YOU WANNA BE SCIENCE. SCIENCE SPACE BUT ALSO CULTURALLY CONGRUENT WE'RE NOT JUST GONNA BE TRANSLATING ITEM WE WANT. TO LEARN HOW THE COMMITTEE BASS HE RESPOND TO INFORMATION. SO WITH THAT I'M PASSAGE TO MISTER AUDIBLE FROM YET MILLIONS. WITH THE YES WILL. I WAS GONNA SAY MISTER CHAIR BUT THERE VARIAS CHAIRS OF THIS COMMITTEE SAWYER STATE CHAIRS IN THE US AND THE PEARL AND A FLORAL AND ALSO TO ALL OF THE DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS ALL BI CAMERAL OR SUBCOMMITTEE DOING WHAT I BELIEVE IS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK ON THAT WILL HAPPEN IN AND TWENTY I KNOW FOLKS MAY ON MY TEAMMATE. LET ME A LITTLE BIT BUT MAYBE MOVE AWAY A LITTLE BIT FROM MY NOTES TO. ADDRESS JUST FIRST THE CAN A CONTEXTUAL OF A QUESTION IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH THIS WORK. UP BUT ALSO TO IN THE PROCESS IF I QUIT AND ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE RAISED. I KNOW THAT OF FOR EXAMPLE. ASSEMBLYMAN JONES JONES SAWYER REYES AND FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE. ALL THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. BOB IN CERTAINLY THE LAST SEVERAL. ALL SINCE THIS CAMPAIGN IT'S NOT IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR DECADES. WHICH HE MENTIONED WHICH IS THE QUESTION OF FEAR. IN THE TWO THOUSAND CENSUS WE HAD A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT. THAT WAS RELATIVELY FRIENDLY TO CALIFORNIA. RELATIVELY FRIENDLY TO OF. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES RELATIVELY FRIENDLY TO MULTI CULTURAL OF A COMMUNITIES WE FACE A DIFFERENT REALITY TODAY THAN WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND BUT THAT WAS UNDER OF PRESIDENT CLINTON. OUR AND YET IN TWO THOUSAND THERE WAS A LOT OF MISTRUST OF THE OF THE GOVERNMENT AT THEIR TENDS TO BE OUR DURING THE COURSE OF HISTORY. IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE HAD THE PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO WAS WIDELY SUPPORTED IN CALIFORNIA BY BOB. FOLKS ACROSS THE ACROSS THE POLITICAL A GEOGRAPHIC SPECTRUM YET THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF MISTRUST WHEN IT CAME TO THE SENSES IN TWO THOUSAND TEN DESPITE THE GREAT WORK THAT THE US AND THE CENSUS CAMPAIGN DID IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BOB THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME CALIFORNIA DIDN'T GROW IN TERMS OF OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION. THAT WAS TWO THOUSAND AND TEN BUT YET WE DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB THE STATE DID IN DOING A UP THE BEST JOB I COULD TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS ADEQUATELY COUNTED IN THE CENSUS THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE POLITICAL STAKES ARE MUCH HIGHER AND NOT TO TURN THIS INTO A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT'S NOT. BUT CERTAINLY ONE CAN'T SIMPLY JUST READ BETWEEN THE TEAMS WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS ON THIS ISSUE ON HEAD ON AND THE ISSUE IS THAT THE LEVELS OF FEAR PARTIAL HEIGHTENED. IN THE VERY IS COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN THAT ARE TYPICALLY UNDERCOUNTED BUT ALSO WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUTSIDE OF THE UNDERCOUNT CATEGORY ARE JUST YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S A LATINO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S THE ARAB AMERICAN COMMUNITY. ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY THERE'S VARIOUS COMMUNITIES INSIDE A CALIFORNIA FOLKS. HAVE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF FEAR. WHERE IT RELATES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO. ALL OF A SENATOR OUR IN OUR LOVE SAYING THIS IN THIS CONTEXT THAT SENATOR RUSSELL SO RIGHTLY SAID IN HER COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SHIFT FROM THE NEGATIVE TO THE POSITIVE AND HOW YOU JUXTAPOSE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE IS THAT WHILE THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT IT GOES MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT IT'S A LOT OF FEAR TOWARDS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THE PART OF MANY OF THE VULNERABLE COMMUTERS IN CALIFORNIA THERE SEEMS TO BE A GROWING AMOUNT. OF SUPPORT FOR THE STATE. THE CALIFORNIA HAVE FOR BOB THE POLITICAL. GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES INSIDE OF THE STATE OF FOR MANY REASONS SOME WHICH ARE ARE VERY OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE. SO WHAT DOES THAT DO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR US AS WE COME INTO INTO THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU KNOW THERE WAS A CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY. ABOUT WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN THAT ULTIMATELY BRANDS ITSELF BUT THE STATEWIDE CAMPAIGN VERSES DOING THE MICRO OF MESSAGING WITH AUTHENTIC OF MESSENGERS THE PEOPLE TRUST. AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU THAT WE NEED TO DO BOTH OF THOSE ONE DOESN'T. DOESN'T WORK WITHOUT THE OTHER. ALL THE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WORK THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING HERE. THE QUESTION THAT SENATOR LAWCENTER USED TO BE SENATOR PADILLA BUT NOW ARE. SECRETARY PRETTY UP MAKE MENTION WITH RESPECT TO HOW WE ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF THIS INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION. YOU KNOW THAT COULD PRESENT ITSELF AS TEN MAYBE FIFTEEN MAYBE 20% OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE PREPARED AND HAVE A STRATEGY. ALL THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED AS WE SPEAK AND COULDN'T. IN EFFECT INTELLIGENTLY TALK ABOUT IT TODAY IF YOU WANTED TO ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS YOU YOU YOU WANT TO BE OUT IN THE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. THAT I THINK THAT WE'RE VERY WELL PREPARED FOR US TO DEAL WITH MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION IN A WAY IN WHICH HELPS US UP TOWNER OF THOSE MESSAGES BOB WHETHER IT'S IN THE DARK WEB OR WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW ONCE IT GETS. TO THE VARIOUS SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. OR. IT GOES PUBLIC WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL MEDIA. HOW TO COUNTER ALL THAT THERE'S A WHOLE STRATEGY TO DO THAT NOW WE DON'T WANT THAT TO TAKE A DON'T WANT TO BE PLAYING. DEFENSE RIGHT WE WANT TO BE WE WANT TO HAVE A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN BUT THE POSITIVE CAMPAIGN HERE IS THE FACT THAT. BOB BUT PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING THAN EVER. TO GET TO BE ENGAGED THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET PEOPLE ENGAGE WE OUGHT NOT TREAT. UP CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THIS VICTIMS EVEN THOUGHTHERE ARE VICTIMS NO NO QUESTION ABOUT IT WE NEED TO TREAT THEM AS AGENTS OF CHANGE AND WE BELIEVE THAT. GIVEN THE WAY WE'RE APPROACHING THIS CAMPAIGN WE'RE APPROACHING IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. AND CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING DEEPER INTO DETAIL WITH YOU ON ON SOME OF THE TACTICS AND HOW WE SEEK TO EMPLOY THIS THOSE TACTICS PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO. HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO MEDIA BUYS BECAUSE I THINK I HEARD THAT QUESTION BEING REYES AND COURSE STACY WAS SITTING OUT THERE. WANTED TO JUMP IN ANSWER THE QUESTION BEFORE WAS ACTUALLY HER TURN. SO I WILL I DO WANT TO I DO WANT TO TURN TO. CAROLINE BACKER AND YOU SEE ON THE FOR MORE INPUT ON THAT BUT ALSO TO SAY. THIS ABOUT BOTH OF THEM. I MEAN CAROLINE HAS BEEN. COVERING ALL OF THE CENSUS ACTIVITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. ALL BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW THAT WE WERE IN PLAY FOR THIS CALL. OR THAT THIS R. F. P. WAS WAS HAD BEEN PUT OUT IN. THE TO THE MATTER IS THAT YOU KNOW FOR ALL OF US AND BURKE THREE. CERTAINLY MERCURY CALIFORNIA THIS IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE'RE DOING THAT IS MORE pWORKING AND STACY. IF I WERE TO DESCRIBE THIS AS IT IS AS AS I DO IN THE TERMS THAT I THINK OF. CAROLINE IS MORE LIKE THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER STACY IS THE CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST. BOB AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE. A FORMIDABLE TEAM OF PEOPLE ARE THAT ARE READY TO DO THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. SO THAT WE CAN ALL BE PROUD OF THE ACCOUNT WHEN IT HAPPENS. SO I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER START FIRST TO A PARENT. Q. FAR BEYOND AND THANK YOU. CHAIRPERSON BERMAN AND CHAIR SENATE. AND TOP COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU OPENLY AND WITH THE PUBLIC AND HEAR FROM YOU ALL I'M HERE FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED AND DO THIS BEFORE HIM I'M CAROLYN BACKER I'M BASED HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON SINCE THIS RELATED ACTIVITIES FOR OUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME I GEARING UP FOR THIS VERY MOMENT AND TWENTY TWENTY AS WELL. OUR GOAL IS YOUR GOAL WE SHARE THE SAME GOAL IS ALL ALL CALIFORNIANS WHICH IS TO GET COUNTED. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ACCURATE REPRESENTATION IN CONGRESS AND ACCESS TO SUCH A CRITICAL PROGRAMS IN COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO WE SHARE YOUR OBJECTIVES AND WE TOO ARE HERE TO HELP. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR TEAM AND AT REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT. OF TALK TODAY WHICH WE WILL ADD TO ABOUT THE INTEGRATED AND BLENDED APPROACH. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE JUST A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE WORD MEDIA I KNOW IT'S COME UP A LOT. WE REFERENCE ETHNIC MEDIA A LOT BUT WE ALSO REFERENCE MULTI CULTURAL MEDIA. BECAUSE ARE HARD TO COUNT COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. REPRESENT VARIOUS ETHNICITIES BUT THEY ALSO REPRESENT. CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE. VETERANS THE EIGHTY A COMMUNITY WHICH TAKES ON MANY DIFFERENT FACES. HOMELESS YOU KNOW I COULD GO ON WE HAVE MEDIA PARTNERS THAT HAVE BEEN A PART OF OUR TEAM. SENSE BEFORE THIS RP WAS OUT AND CERTAINLY WERE WITH US. AT THE TABLE IN REAL TIME WHEN WE WERE PUTTING A PLAN TOGETHER. TO PRESENT TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE DO HAVE VISIONS FOR ROBUST AIR GAME IF YOU WILL TO COMPLEMENT THE ACTIVITIES ALREADY ON THE GROUND I ALREADY UNDER WAY ON THE GROUND. WE HAVE A TEAM OF WHAT WE CALL MICRO MEDIA REGIONAL TEAM LEADS WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CUT THAT COMPRISE THE TEN REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING A PLAN THAT INTEGRATES BOTH OF THEM. AS CHAIRPERSON BERMAN MENTIONED THERE IS NO TIME FOR A HONEYMOON PERIOD WE'VE ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES QUITE LITERALLY AND GOTTEN TO WORK AND WE HAVE ATTENDED AN I. P. W. JUST LAST WEEK AND SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES. SO WE'RE EAGER AND ALREADY UNDER WAY HEARING FROM THE STATE'S CONTRACTED PARTNERS AND OTHERS I. PERSONALLY I'VE BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF A LOT OF INCREASE FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS A CBO'S. AND WE WANT TO HEAR FROM AS MANY AS WE CAN BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY I GROUND UP EFFORT. SECRETARY PATEA MENTIONED SO WE ARE IN A PHASE RIGHT NOW OF DATA AND INTELLIGENCE GATHERING IN AUGUST. I TO INFORM A CAMPAIGN THAT THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED THAT IS CULTURALLY CONGRUENT AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES AND MORE THAT I JUST MENTIONED. THAT'S REALLY OUR OUR OUR APPROACH IS THIS IS THIS BLEND OF GROUND AND AIR AND IT COMPLIMENTS WITH THE STATE CENSUS OFFICES ALREADY BELTS. AND THEY WORK UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW IS FOR US TO LISTEN AND COMPLIMENTS AND NOT DUPLICATE RESOURCES UNLESS WE DO SO WITH INTENTION IF THERE IS A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT NEEDS. YOU KNOW THAT WHERE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE REACHING THEM FOR VERY INTENTIONAL REASON THAT IS OUR INTENTION IS TO DO EVERYTHING STRATEGICALLY BUT YET NIMBLY BECAUSE THIS CAMPAIGN ISN'T JUST BEING FORMED IN INFORMED IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST. IT'S GOING TO BE INFORMED IN REAL TIME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH APRIL TWENTY TWENTY AND THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD AND EVEN BEYOND INTO INTO THE LATTER PART OF TWENTY TWENTY WHEN WE WILL COMPILE ALL KINDS OF INSIGHTS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY INFORM THE STATE. IN TEN YEARS FROM NOW SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE WORKING IN PROGRESS AND CONTINUE OUR WORK AND BUILD A CAMPAIGN AND DESIGN A CAMPAIGN THAT IS INFORMED. YOU DO HAVE SOME MATERIALS IN FRONT BE TODAY THAT GIVE US SERVE OUR TIME LINE CERTAINLY RIGHT NOW AND INTO SEPTEMBER WHEN WE HOPE TO. PUT FORWARD SOME MEDIA ACTIVITIES SORT OF A SOFT LAUNCH A FEW WELL INFORMED BY THE ANALYSIS THAT'S UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW. THAT WILL INCLUDE THING WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHICH IS WEBSITE THAT HAS A PASSWORD PROTECTED PARTNER PORTAL SO SOME OF THOSE VIDEOS THAT YOU HER GENEVIEVE TALK ABOUT. HIS TACKLE COMMUNITY CAN BE SHARED SO THAT. WE CAN SHARE MATERIALS WORDS. THERE ARE SO DOES AN A. CBO'S WHO WOULD LIKE THAT HELP WE'VE ALREADY HEARD IT. THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO DOWNLOAD MATERIALS BUT ALSO UPLOAD MATERIALS SO THAT THERE IS A SHARING OF BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES AND IT REALLY IS COLLABORATIVE. FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND TOP DOWN IF YOU WILL FROM A STATEWIDE LEVEL BUT REALLY INFORMED BY A REGIONAL APPROACH AS WELL. YES WE WILL HAVE A ROBUST EARNED MEDIA STRATEGY PAID MEDIA STRATEGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY BUT IT WILL CONTINUALLY CHANGE IF YOU IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONE WORD FOR ME TODAY IT IS NIMBLE. BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN REAL TIME PARTICULARLY WHEN THE CENSUS IS LIVE AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO WHO'S FILLING IT OUT AND WHO'S NOT. YOU KNOW DOWN TO THE TRACKS LEVEL WITH THIS IT'S INCREASE I BELIEVE. DEEP DATA RESOURCE SO WERE WERE APPROACHING THIS CAMPAIGN VERY DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU MIGHT THINK OF A TRADITIONAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AND ASK QUESTIONS AS YOU HAVE THEM. MISINFORMATION AND PERMISSION IS A BIG PART OF OUR TEAM IT'S A BIG PART OF OUR PLAN. TO CLARIFY MISINFORMATION IS USUALLY DEFINED AS PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT IS RE TWEETED INADVERTENTLY BY SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THEIR SPREADING. SOMETHING THAT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASED. THIS INFORMATION COMES FROM BAD ACTORS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION LATELY UNFORTUNATELY ON THE DEEP AND DARK WEB AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP TEAMS IN THE COUNTRY INSIDE MERCURY. HIGHLY EXPERIENCED IN ROOTING OUT BAD ACTORS AND AS A TEAM WE WILL COLLECTIVELY PUT FORWARD RECOMMENDED RESPONSES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TACKLE THOSE SO THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW I KNOW THAT A LOT OF US WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. I AGREE IT IS THE SAD REALITY AND WE HOPE TO COME AT IT BEFORE IT MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE MAINSTREAM. WE WILL COMBAT IT. SO WE HAVE BIG PLANS IN BIG VISIONS BUT WE NEED TO BE INFORMED BY THE PARTNERS ON THE GROUND THAT IS KEY TO WHAT WE WILL BE BUILDING. TRUSTED MESSENGERS. ARE AS CRITICAL IF NOT MORE SO THAN THE MESSAGES I'VE HEARD THAT A FEW TIMES TODAY AND THAT'S THE KIND OF MENTALITY THAT WE HAVE APPROACHING THIS CAMPAIGN. AND BY THE WAY THE GROUND ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN UNDER WAY FOR SOME TIME RIGHT SO WE WANT TO BUILD AROUND THEM AND LIFT THEM UP AND SUPPORT THAT AND COMPLEMENT THEM. SO WE THANK YOU RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE HELPED GET US HERE TODAY. WERE VERY PASSIONATE IF YOU CAN'T TELL AND I THINK YOU WILL BY THE END OF THIS HEARING ABOUT THIS WORK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROJECT THE MOST IMPORTANT PROJECT. OFFER MERCURY CALIFORNIA AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. AND I WOULD BE ALSO REMISS NOT TO GIVE STACY JUST A FEW MINUTES TO TALK ABOUT. THE MEDIA ASPECT AS WELL STACEY COMES WITH A LOT OF EXPERIENCE FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA BUT ALSO AT HAS BROUGHT. A VERY UNIQUE SET OF EXPERTISE TO OUR TEAM AS WELL SIXTEEN. I'D LIKE TO QUESTION ABOUT THE RATES THAT ARE GOING TO BE PUT FORWARD AS THE WE HAVE A COMPLEMENT OF THE ELECTION AND THE CENSUS ROLLING I THINK THAT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER AND I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT BUT BEYOND THAT I WAS EXCITED EARLIER. THE DRESS THAT. AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR MEDIA PART. AS WE WENT INTO THIS AS WELL AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS RECENTLY AS THIS LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WE HAVE MET WITH OUR ETHNIC MEDIA PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR OTHER MEDIA PARTNERS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP US REACH SOME OF THE OTHER POPULATIONS THAT CAROLINE MENTIONED. I'M TRADITIONALLY CALMS CONTRACT YOU WOULD BY MEDIA AND- NEGOTIATES. THE PLAN FOR A YEAR THAT'S A TRADITIONAL APPROACH I WE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT THIS TIME AND WE'VE BEEN VERY UP FRONT WITH OUR ETHNIC MEDIA PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR OTHER MEDIA PARTNERS TO SAY LOOK WE ARE GOING TO PARTNER WITH YOU BUT WE HAVE TO BE NIMBLE AND RESPONSIVE AS WE GET INTO THIS CAMPAIGN. FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS ONE WE WANT TO BE RICH REACTING IN REAL TIME WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO AND FORMER CAMPAIGN AS WE GET FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS WE SEE AS WE GET INTO THAT COUNT WHO'S RESPONDING AND NOT RESPONDING. SO I NEGOTIATING IN ADVANCE WITH OUR MEDIA COMPANIES WILL TAKE IT WILL HAPPEN BUT WILL TAKE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TURN IT WILL TAKE OUR TEAMS COLLABORATING AND SHARING AN ADVANCE WHERE WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE AND KNOWING THAT MEDIA MAY NEED DISPATCH WE MAY NEED TO MOVE FROM ONE LINK MEETING TO AND BIG AS WERE HAVING A SHORT CAN'T IN THAT READ. IN THAT PARTICULAR COMMUNITY SO. YOUR STAFF ARE YOUR PARTNERS LOOK INTO THIS WITH A COMMITMENT THEY HAVE. US THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND IN A WAY THAT HAS NEVER. PROBABLY MATERIALIZE IN THE PAST THEY'VE WORKED ON IT HAND IN HAND WITH A MERCURY OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I'M ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS AND ARE COMMUNITIES. AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO US THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH CREATIVE WAYS TO IT TO HANDLE THAT SITUATION AS WE GET INTO NIMBLE NESS. MOVING OF DOLLARS AND REACTING IN REAL TIME. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO ON OUR YARD CURRY YEAH I JUST HAVE A QUESTION I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW WE USE WITHIN THE WORLD. WE HAVE SEVERAL. MULTICULTURAL MEDIA PARTNERS INCLUDING ONE BY THE NAME OF ETHNIC MEDIA SERVICES WHO SERVICE SAYS MIDDLE EASTERN NATIVE AMERICAN API. LATINO COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA AND HAS FOR YEARS. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE DATA TO SUPPORT THOSE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES AND- OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM ETHNIC MEDIA SERVICES HAS BEEN A PART OF THAT HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN CENSUS ACTIVITIES AND DOING BRIEFINGS ALREADY NOT SEPARATELY FROM OUR CONTRACT AND IS IN IS REALLY PLUGGED IN SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO. ANALYZING THAT LANDSCAPE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IN AUGUST TO INFORM A GREATER PLAN TO REACH VERY SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES BUT WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT WE'VE BROUGHT THE RIGHT PARTNERS TO THE TABLE TO HELP US DO THAT. YEAH YEAH. YES RIGHT. A DIFFICULT TO COUNT RIGHT I'M GOING TO BE VERY POSITIVE AND HELPFUL SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PORTION OF OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HELP YOU MIGHT NEED ON THAT BUT I HOPE THAT YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO THOSE COMMUNITIES AND ONE AND ONE THING TO NOTE ON THAT IS WE DO HAVE A SURVEY IT SHOULD BE IN YOUR IN BOXES AND YOUR STAFF'S IN BOXES AS OF THIS WEEK TO ASK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE MEDIA AND SITES THAT YOU HAVE COME ACROSS IN YOUR DISTRICTS REGARDLESS OF ETHNICITY OR DEMOGRAPHIC. SO THAT WE CAN HELP UNDERSTAND HOW YOU'VE REACHED VOTE HERBAL POPULATIONS OF ALL ETHNICITIES BUT ALSO LIFESTYLES RIGHT ETHNICITIES ONLY MAKE UP A PART OF THE HARD TO COUNT TO YOUR POINT THERE'S QUITE A FEW OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND ACTUALLY AN INDEX THAT MEASURES HOW HARD SOMEBODY IS TO COUNT SO I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE AND SHARE YOUR CONCERN AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S OUR JOB TO REACH ALL CALIFORNIANS AND CREATE ALL ALL USE A TERM THAT JONATHAN USED EARLIER A SURROUND SOUND SO THAT WE ARE SHOWING UP IN YOUR FACEBOOK FEED IN REACHING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE. NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM IT ALSO ALONG THE LINE NOT TO FORGET THERE'S NOT ALWAYS INTERNET. RIGHT. THAT'S ONE OF THE HTC DEMOGRAPHIC YES OVER ONE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO THE MEDIA HOW THE MEDIA IS GOING TO GO OUT. LACK OF. INTERNET SOMETHING JUST THIS IS A HAD THE- JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE WE APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION THE OTHER THING ABOUT MEDIA IT'S NOT JUST NECESSARILY ON WHAT MEDIA. PLACEMENT MEANS ON DIGITAL OR INTERNET WERE ALSO WERE AWARE ABOUT DOING OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT AND THAT MEANS LIKE THE BILL BOARDS OUT ALSO LEVERAGING MOVE MOVIE THEATERS OR- RADIOS OR OTHER SORT OF TRUSTED MESSENGERS SO WE'RE TRYING TO. THE PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK YOU HEARD THIS IN THE LAST PANEL BUT ALSO WITHIN. WITHIN THIS PANEL THE PARTNERSHIP AT THE GROUND LEVEL IS GOING TO BE SUPER CRITICAL. AND WE ARE AYE DENNIS AIN'T THAT LAND AND THOSE TRISTEN MESSENGERS SO WE CAN HAVE A MULTI LEVEL APPROACH ON DISSEMINATING THE INFORMATION. WE ALSO HAVE HAVE CONNECTED SOME. EXISTING EFFORTS IN THE RURAL AREAS IN PARTICULAR WITH. COUNTY CITIES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE AND THEY CAN HELP DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION. SO IT'S NOT JUST THE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE ALL. UNDERSTANDING WHEN WE SAY MEDIA COULD ALSO JUST BE A BROCHURE IT COULD ALSO BE. A VIDEO AT A CLINIC OR EVEN AT A MOVIE THEATER OR BILLBOARD AND THE STOP SIGN SO WE ARE WANTING TO BE SUPER. CREATIVE AND HOW WE DISSEMINATE THAT FOR ME. I THANK YOU. OKAY IF I ADD SOMETHING. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT OUR TEAM DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH OTHER STATE CONTRACTS I'M LIKE FIRST FIVE. I'M IN GOING INTO THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES SO WE HAVE TAKEN SPECIAL ATTENTION ANNA. BUT ON TOP OF THAT I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL SPECIALLY AND REGION ONE AND TWO. IS BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT HOW WE INTEGRATE WITH THE GROUNDS. BECAUSE THERE'S OF THE HEART THAT COUNTS ARE SPREAD. OUT THEY'RE NOT IN THE AREA AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND WORK IN A- AIR GAME TRADITIONALLY WITH PROBABLY LOCAL RADIO AND A LOT OF THOSE REGIONS REALLY LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL. AND THEN ALSO GET INTO THE GROUND AND REALLY GO IN AND MAKE A CONNECTION. ON A ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS AND WE LOOK AT THAT AS THEM. IT IS THE IN YOUR URBAN AREAS RIGHT. FAST PICKET SURE THE RURAL AREAS START NOW. YOU'LL BE THERE NOT. YEAH YEAH. THANK YOU GERMAN PAN. THANK YOU AND AFTER THAT I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND AGAIN FREE **** YOU BEING HERE. FIRST OF ALL. HE FRETS SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THEM ON THIS AND SO FORTH AND THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT CAN YOU SPEAK TO I WOULD SAY THE PURPOSE SO LET'S WAS THAT YOU HAVE TO FOR WELL YOU HAVE MORE TO FACE FONG AS A TOO BIG BROAD PHASES RIGHT SO ONE IS THE LEAD UP TO THE CENSUS. RIGHT BECAUSE ALL YOUR CAP PROP IN THE GROUND. AND THEN. DURING THE CENSUS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GET THE FEEDBACK WHILE THIS NEIGHBORHOODS REALLY COUNTY WELL THAT ONE'S NOT WE NEED TO GET SOME. THAT'S A NUMBER OF THIS PART NOTHING THAT YOU WILL BE DOUBLE THE BEGINNING BUT YOU WON'T HA. DIRECTED ON HIS PARTICIPATE BECAUSE UNTIL THE ACTUAL START COUNTING. SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT PROPORTION RESOURCES THE C. DOING I GUESS THE- PREP WORK ON THE GROUND RIGHT TO GETTING LIKE GETTING EVERYONE READY THIS IS WHY THIS AT THIS IS IMPORTANT. THE WHATEVER STRATEGIES YOU THERE AND THEN OF COURSE GAME ON. POSTCARDS ARE OUT NOW WE'RE TAKING THAT YOU'LL THE RAPID RESPONSE. DEBBIE SURE WE GET THAT SO CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK ABOUT HOW YOU THINK YOU NEED TO DISTRIBUTE THE RESOURCES BETWEEN THOSE TWO. PHASES ARE THOSE TWO PARTS. I SHORT IT IT'S A BIT PREMATURE BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS. TO BORROW YOUR WORD PHASE OF. LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS AND LISTENING AND UNDERSTANDING THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ALREADY UNDER WAY BOB BY THE WAY BOTH ON THE GROUND AND RAN IN THE AIR RIGHT YOU HEARD FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENDOWMENT TODAY ABOUT SOME OF THEIR PARTNERSHIPS WITH UNIVISION. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT DEPLOYING AND ALLOCATING RESOURCES ALL OF THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THAT'S HAPPENING IN IN REAL TIME. OKAY SO YOU'RE SENT BECAUSE THEY ALL TWENTY TWENTY APRIL FIRST WE DO ENVISION A BIG DAY I TAKE OVER AT THE STATEWIDE AND LOCAL LEVEL. QUITE PREMATURE OBVIOUSLY TO TALK ABOUT. DOLLARS BUT WE ENVISION THAT EVERY COMMUNITY ROB ORAL AND URBAN ALIKE WILL HAVE SENSES IN THEIR AIR. CENSUS ON THEIR MOBILE DEVICES IF THEY HAVE THEM SINCE THIS AT THEIR COFFEE SHOP IN THE MORNING. AT THEIR CHURCH OR PLACE OF WORSHIP SO IT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY VERY IMPORTANT. DAY AND PERIOD FOR THAT REAL TIME RESPONSE BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE AND TRYING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO THAT THEIR INFORMED AND WISE RIGHT SO THAT IT'S NOT JUST MADE UP. ALL RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY CAN GET BACK TO US AS YOUR FIGURED OUT RATE IS IT I MEAN I'M NOT TALK ABOUT. I MEAN JUST ROUGHLY LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A QUARTER AND THREE QUARTERS OF THE HALF AND HALF TWO THIRDS ONE THIRD IRATE JUST GET IT. SO YEAH SO I PART OF OUR PLAN FOR THIS FALL IS TO REALLY BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE BARRIERS FEAR HAS BEEN A WORK FOR HEARING A LICENSE AND SO. THIS ISN'T A NORMAL CALMS COMMUNICATION EVEN BEHAVIOR CHANGE CAMPAIGN THIS IS THAT WE GOT TO GET UP AND GOING AND GET PEOPLE COMFORTABLE. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE DO LAUNCH A LARGER. CAMPAIGN WE'VE STARTED THE SOFT CONVERSATION. SOMETIMES THAT IS MORE EXPENSIVE. RIGHT THEN DOING THE AIR GAME. THE SO IN THEIR NESTS AND WHY WE PLAN THOSE OUT. I WOULD IT WOULD BE REMISS FOR US TO TELL YOU A PERCENTAGE BECAUSE- THE REALITY IS THOSE COSTS WHEN YOU DO THOSE MORE IN COMMUNITY VERY FOCUSED APPROACH AS- IT CAN BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN DOING A BIGGER BROADER. BLAST YEAH SO. WE WILL HAVE THAT HERE VERY SHORTLY ON HOW THAT WILL ROLL OUT FOR THE FALL. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE WE GIVE YOU GUYS THAT KIND OF FLAT LANDS. BUT I WANTED TO. SHARE WITH YOU IN A PLANNING PHASE. HE GREATER THAN THIRTY EVEN JUST BUYING WELL BY AND I WOULD IT IS YES FOR EXAMPLE THE FIRST OFF FARTHER DOWN QUESTION IS BECAUSE BY THE WAY ONCE YOU'VE THROUGH PHASE ONE YOUR WRIST EITHER SPENT THE MONEY OR BEEN BILLED FOR IT SO I MEAN THEN YOU'LL HAVE WHATEVER'S LEFT FOR FACE TO SO. YOU NEED TO THINK IN ADVANCE ABOUT IT RIGHT. I DO CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT. ANYWAYS IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE PREP WORK A LOT OF LAST MINUTE LIKE YOU CAN BE NIMBLE BUT YOU'RE YOU CAN'T BE SHOWING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WELL THAT COMMUNITY IS NOT RESPONDING FOR AWHILE NOW WE- SHOW UP LITERALLY AS YOU KNOW WE'RE COUNTING DOES NOW SAY HEY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO COUNT YOU RIGHT I MEAN IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE THAT WORK UP FRONT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE. A SO YOU HAVE TO. YOU KNOW SO OKAY. THE OTHER THING THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD ACTUALLY. IN TERMS OF INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT. WELL THOSE MADE REFERENCE THAT. ACTUALLY YOU MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE. LESS THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CENSUS IS THE MAIN TOPIC BUT SORT OF WORK IT IN RIGHT SO FOR EXAMPLE DO WE GET CENSUS MESSAGES INTO. MOVIES ARE COMING OUT OF TIME. TV SHOWS DO A NOVELLA ABOUT THE CENSUS RATE OR SOMETHING RIGHT HAVE THAT BROADCAST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. YOU MAY BE SPEAK TO CONVERSATIONS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT AGAIN WE'RE SEVEN MONTHS OUT SO. PROBABLY IF YOU WANT TO GET. IN THE VALLEY PRIDE HAVE TO START FILMING READY. SO I DO I JUST THE ONE DAY I CAN I CAN IMAGINE THE PLOT NOW. I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADD A COUPLE OF THINGS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HEARING ON. IS THAT PEOPLE WANT TANGIBLE AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION SO THEY CAN CONNECTED TO THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES. ALONG WE ARE ALSO DOING AMER CREE SUPPORTING US WITH THIS IS A FIVE PRONG APPROACH TO REVIEWING ALL THE EXISTING DATA AND ALL THE INFORMATION THAT. OUR EXISTING PARTNERS HAVE COLLECTED. THEY WILL ALSO HAVE A MESSAGE TESTING THROUGH OUT AND WE WILL ALSO DO SOME MESSAGE PAULINE TO ENSURE THAT THE MESSAGE IS STILL RESONATING. THE INTEGRATED APPROACH IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T PLANNED. WE WERE WE WANT TO IDENTIFY THOSE TRUSTED MESSENGERS WITHIN THE MEDIA OR EVEN IN THAT IN TRUMP WHAT WE CALL THE INTRON LEVEL. WITH% WHICH COULD BE A DOCTOR OR A COULD BE A COMMUNITY PROMOTE THOUGHT OUT OR IT CAN BE A AT. CITY COUNCIL OR EVEN A PASTOR. WE. ONE IDENTIFIED THOSE SO THEY CAN HELP US SORT OF. COMMUNICATE THAT INFORMATION SO PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THE SENSES IMPACTS. WE KNOW THAT MOMS TRANSPORTATION CHILDCARE AND SCHOOLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. PARTICULAR IT WERE TRYING TO REACH THE ZERO TO FIVE. I'M WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION HOUSING TRANSPORTATION PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS SUPER IMPORTANT. SO WE NEED TO IDENTIFY AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IT'S QUANTIFIABLE BUT ENSURE THAT IT'S A CULTURALLY CONGRUENT AND WHEN WE SEE CULTURING CONGRUENT. WE MEAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DEVELOP A MESSAGE FOR THAT ROUTED. COMMUNITY OR THAT TARGET. OF AUDIENCE. ALSO SAY WE'RE DOING SAID WE ARE DOING SOME INTEGRATION SO WE HAVE SPOKEN TO OUR MEDIA PARTNERS FOR THEM TO HELP US NOT ONLY DEVELOP CONTENT AND PROGRAMMING WITHIN THEIR- THEIR OWNED. AND OPERATED PROPERTIES WERE ALSO WORKING WITH BUSINESS SO WE'RE EXTENDING BEYOND JUST WHAT THE MEDIA'S GONNA DO FOR US. FOR EXAMPLE WORKING WITH HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE AB PARENTS THAT ARE GOING HOME WITH NEW BABIES CENTERS THESE YES EXACTLY CENSUS ONESIES THAT THEY AYE COUNTS REALLY TRYING TO. GO DEEPER AND INTEGRATE IN PEOPLE'S REAL LIVES SO IT WHEN THEY DO GET THE BIG MESSAGE. THEY ARE IT'S NOT COLD IT'S NOT A COLD FIRST TOUCH SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND UNIQUE. AN ADVANCE THOSE ARE GOING TO START SEEING IN THE FALL WAYS OF INTEGRATING OKAY AND THEN I KNOW I ASK THE QUESTION THE. PREVIOUS PANEL BUT MADE JUST BRIEFLY YEAH I SAID. YOUR SENSES CAN COME IN WITH THEIR STRATEGY ON A TO WHAT DEGREE ARE THEY COMMUNICATING WITH YOU BUT WHAT THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO SO HOW DO YOU SEE THE POSITIONING OUR STATE. STRATEGY IN RELATION TO THE FEDS. WHAT IS THAT SO WE CONTINUE OF AND OF COURSE WORKING WITH THEM THE LAST TWO YEARS ON A NUMBER OF THINGS. I'M ALL LET THEM DO MORE THE LOGISTICS AND HOW THEY'RE COORDINATING OR NOT IN TERMS OR NOT. IN TERMS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SECTOR MIGHT BE WORKING WITH MARIE TOMATO HE WAS THE PRODUCER OF EAST LOS HIGH. WITH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ANNENBERG INNOVATION LAB SO THEY'VE BEEN REALLY WE'VE BEEN REALLY DOWN IN LA WE'VE MET WITH THE WRITERS GUILD DIRECTORS' GUILD REALLY TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLACE TO PLACE IT IN TWO OF THAT AREA THAT REALLY WANTS TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THEY REALLY DO WANT TO DO SOMETHING. YOU KNOW TERMS OF NOVELLAS ONE OF THE THINGS THERE'S ALWAYS THAT THAT SOAP OPERA CHARACTER THAT IS UNEMPLOYED. AND SO THEY TALKED ABOUT BRINGING THEM IN AS A NUMERATOR ALL YOU KNOW YOU KNOW. YOU GOT A JOB RATE LIKE IN THESE AND SO THEN THAT THEY WERE LIKE WEAVING THAT INTO THAT SO. AT THE CENSUS BUREAU'S TALKING ABOUT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND WE'RE TRYING TO PARTNERS IS THAT HERE IN AND LA BUT- WE ALSO HAVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH A LOT OF. THE A Y. IN OUR TEAM AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA DEEP IN IT NOW THAT YOU KNOW. THAT I DON'T NEED TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT AND THEN BE ABLE TO COURT. OKAY WHY ARE YOU YOUNG AND RUBICAM HAD THE FIFTH FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS CONTRACT AND WE HAVE PARTNERS AS PART OF OUR- CONTRACT WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDIA PLANNING AND- STRATEGY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE AGAIN ONLY DUPLICATING EFFORTS WHEN INTEND WHEN INTENDED. YOU KNOW WE HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE COLLATERAL MATERIAL THAT THE. US CENSUS BUREAU HAS PUT FORWARD. HE CALIFORNIA. THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO WORK IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES SO WERE. IN COMMUNICATION WITH OUR PARTNERS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO TALK ABOUT THAT. THE WAY THE TERM HARD TO COUNT IS DEFINED DIFFERENTLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAN IT IS AT THE- STATE LEVEL. SO THESE ARE THE INSIGHTS THAT WE'VE MADE SURE TO HAVE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ON AS PART OF OUR TEAM SO THAT WE CAN BE INFORMED. OKAY AND THEY'LL BE WORKING THROUGH WITH US THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN IT'S NOT JUST AT THE BEGINNING THEY ARE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH US ALL THE WAY THROUGH SO THAT WE MAKE SURE WHEN WE RESPOND. IT'S RELEVANT AND NOT CONFUSING AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AND EIGHTY. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TAKING A WHILE. THE SURF FILED MORE COMMENTS AND BECAUSE WE ONLY A PREVIOUS HEARING WAS FOCUSED A LOT ON LANGUAGE OBVIOUSLY THIS INVOLVES LANGUAGE. THE API COMMUTERS MANY MANY DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BY THE WAY WE ALSO THINK ABOUT ALL THE VARIOUS OTHER COMPANIES. HOW WE CAN MAKE A PEOPLE'S ABILITIES. OTHERS SO. LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO ABOUT. DOING THIS I CERTAINLY HEARD. FROM TO BE STABLE MIKE. ARE GETTING IN OTHER TYPES OF THINGS BECAUSE OF THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MESSAGES ARE. ANYWHERE AND OUT OF AND HOW IT'S CONNECTING IN. SO THAT CERTAINLY. WHICH ONE. ABOUT THIS THIS GOES ON. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. QUESTION. DESERVE STATEWIDE COORDINATOR FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. DIFFERENT QUESTION BUT ONE ISSUE THAT A LOT OF CONTRACT PARTNERS HAVE BROUGHT UP. IS THE DIFFICULTY THAT THEY FACE MAKING PLANNING AND BUDGETARY DECISIONS ON MEDIA WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW. HOW MUCH THE STATEWIDE MEDIA CONTRACTORS GOING TO INVEST IN THEIR REGION IT SOUNDED LIKE MAYBE FALL. WHICH IS WHICH IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER YEAH TIMING FACTORED IN VARIOUS HIGH YEAH THAT WE WILL BE I GOT BEING AT AN EXECUTIVE REPORT ON ALL OF OUR- DATA GATHERING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT OUR RESEARCH. THAT WE PULL TOGETHER FROM ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AND EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST. I'D SAY TWELVE MONTHS. AND THEN WILL USE THAT TO APPLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE MEDIA FOR IMMEDIATELY INTO THE FALL. I AM. I WOULD SUSPECT AS WE LEAVE SEPTEMBER OCTOBER AND WE GET INTO NOVEMBER. WE WILL BE ABLE TO BE EVEN MORE INTEGRATED WITH OUR THE GROUND GAME. THEY ARE IN THEIR PLANNING STAGES WE UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THEIR IMPLEMENTATION PLANS THAT ARE DUE ON OCTOBER. OUR GOAL IS TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE WON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIBLE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS GREAT. AND SPEAKING OF COORDINATION GOT A WITH THE FOLKS IN THE DIFFERENT REGIONS AND ON THE GROUND. A LOT OF STATE PARTNERS HAVE BEEN USING THEIR BRANDS FOR MONTHS ALREADY I KNOW THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN MY DISTRICT. I THINK IS SANTA CLARA COUNTY MAYBE ALSO SAN MATTEO COUNTY ACROSS BEEN ALAMEDA COUNTY. MANY OF THEM A BRANDING THAT'S ALREADY WELL KNOWN IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WALL SOME OF THEIR BRANDING OUR STYLES HAVE TO BE MODIFIED. TO SYNC WITH THE STATE OR BRANDING THEY'LL BE DEVELOPED AND AS MERCURY HAVE A PLAN EVERY BRAND. THE STATE'S CURRENT LOGO SEN SEWED SO NOT MODIFIED WHAT WERE WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS DEVELOP A BRAND AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO RIGHT NOW. THAT THAT CAN BE ADAPTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IF NEEDED. BECAUSE THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF NEED AND DESIRE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. INCLUDING SOME WHO WANT A BRANDT RIGHT HANDED TO THEM. AND WERE WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT BUT IT'S OUR CHALLENGE IN OUR OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A BRAND. THAT IS A STATE WIDE BRAND BUT ALSO ADAPTABLE AND NOT DISRUPTIVE TO THE BRANDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED YOU MENTIONED SEEING IN YOUR OWN DISTRICT. SO THAT'S UNDER WAY AS WE SPEAK AND WERE TALKING WITH OUR PARTNERS ON THE GROUND ABOUT WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW IT COULD BE ADAPTABLE. YOU KNOW CERTAIN COLORS DON'T MATCH OTHER COLORS AND WE WANT TO. GIVE THEM OPTIONS SO THAT WE'RE NOT DISRUPTING OR MODIFYING TO BORROW YOUR WORD. OF GOOD BROWN'S THAT ARE ALREADY OUT THERE AND- GREAT. I DON'T SAID THAT BY THE WAY I THINK I ALSO. I DO THINK THAT GIVING. THE THERE IS A NEED. AND WILL BE A NEED TO HAVE. OVERARCHING THEMES THAT ULTIMATELY THE STATE CAN RALLY BEHIND AS A WHOLE. BECAUSE THE MESSAGE ALL ULTIMATELY. THAT THE OVERALL MESSAGE TO FOLKS IS LOOK. YOU CAN BE COUNTED. AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY. GOING TO BE SAFE FOR YOU TO DO IT. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO GET MIXED UP IN TO. THE DISSECTION OF IT BECAUSE ULTIMATELY ME WE HELP WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THE PRIZE AS WELL SO THAT AS A WHOLE. OF FOLKS KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A TRUSTED ALLY THAT THEY HAVE IN THE STATE. THE STATE'S GOT THE BACK. YEP ABSOLUTELY. WHICH IT WAS HAS BEEN HARD AT YOU KNOW WHEN I'VE BEEN MEETING WITH SOME FOLKS I THROW OUT ALL THE DIFFERENT. LEGAL WAYS THAT WE CAN PROTECT PEOPLE AND IT'S STILL IT DOESN'T RESONATE AND GIVE THEM THAT CONFIDENCE THAT THEY NEED. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL. KIND OF HURDLE. TO CROSS. SO I THINK CAROLYN IT MENTIONED THE SURVEY. THAT WENT OUT TO OUR OFFICES THE ETHNIC MEDIA. SURVEY IT HAS IS GOING OUT ALSO TO THE LOCAL. CBO'S AND ANY CBO'S AND A VERY SIMILAR VERSION OF THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE QUESTIONS MORE ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE UNDER WAY. WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE CENSUS. WERE DEVELOPING NOT AND THAT'S PART OF OUR LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS AND FOUNDATION BUILDING PERIOD PERFECT AND THEN WHAT'S THE BEST WAY WE HEAR A LOT. FROM FROM DIFFERENT. WELL IT ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS WHO SAY I'VE GOT THIS IDEA ABOUT THIS INTEL I'VE GOT THIS YOU KNOW HOW DO I GET THIS TO. YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP. WHAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR OUR CBO'S OR ON YOUR DIFFERENT COMMUNITY. LEADERS TO BE ABLE MARKET WOULD LIKE TO GIVE HERSELF. AS I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU KNOW. PERSONAL EMAILS WHAT I HAVE GOT TO PUT THE PHONE NUMBER THAT IS RIGHT. ACTUALLY WERE REALLY INTERESTED IN HEARING ALL THOSE IDEAS AB THE CENSUS OFFICE HAS DEVELOPED A COMMUNICATIONS THAT SENSES DOT CA DOT GOV EMAIL OKAY AND I WE'VE BEEN SOCIALIZING THAT EMAIL WE'VE BEEN SHARING THAT AND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO ANYONE. M. PUBLIC YOU COULD ALWAYS ALSO EMAIL ME I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE BUT THE COMMUNICATIONS EMAIL AS AS THE BEST WAY FOR FOLKS TO SUBMIT THEIR INFORMATION. SO WE CAN TRACK THAT AND I THINK CAROLINE I'M TOUCHED UPON AT SOME OF OUR SOFT LAUNCH THAT SOFT LUNCH WILL HAVE NOT JUST DOT ORG WEBSITE BUT IT WILL ALSO HAVE A PARTNER POLL PORTAL WILL HAVE A- USER IMPOSSIBLE PASSWORD AT PROTECTIVE IDENTIFICATION. SO FOLKS CAN ALSO UPLOAD AND SHARE INFORMATION AS WELL GREAT WILL HAVE VARIOUS CHANNELS FOR FOLKS TO DO THAT GRAY AND THEN TWO MORE QUESTIONS I'LL TO KEEPING QUICK. AS OF THE THAT'S BEEN IN AS USED SPOKE ABOUT THE CAN MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION ISRAELIS AROUND THAT AND- MAYBE WITHOUT GETTING TOO MUCH OF THE DETAILS AND pKNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE STRATEGY THERE I KNOW I I'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT TO. HAVE SCARED THE BE JESUS OUT OF ME AS TO WHAT PEOPLE ARE I'M NOT A DIGITAL EXPERT BUT I'M GONNA I'M GONNA TURN IT TO EITHER CAROLINE STACY BUT I I'VE BEEN IN A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH. THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK ON THIS AND I MEAN TO FEEL. I THINK EXTREMELY CONFIDENT. OF THEIR ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO COUNTER YEAH THIS THIS TYPE OF. REALLY ON OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN ACCURATE COUNT WITH RESPECT TO THE STRATEGY ONE WORD IT'S TO MITIGATE YEAH SO IF THEY'RE SOMETHING SURFACING IN THE DARK WEB OR THE DEEP WEB. IT STOPS BEFORE IT COMES UP TO THE MAINSTREAM WHERE YOU AND I MIGHT SEE IT. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S JULY OF TWENTY NINETY FOUR NUMBER IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN NOW RIGHT SO THERE WERE LOOKING BACK RIGHT NOW DOING A WHAT WE CALL A LOOK BACK PERIOD TO SEE WHAT'S ALREADY OUT THERE THAT WE HAVE TO. PREPARE TO MITIGATE BUT WHEN THE MISINFORMATION DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN IS AT ITS BEST IS WHEN YOU'RE WERE FINDING THOSE. AS I SAID EARLIER BAD ACTORS AND STOPPING THEM IN THEIR TRACKS BY THE WAY JUST BY MAYOR EXAMPLE OF. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHILE WE WERE IN ONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. THE ONE OF THE PERSONS IS WORKING WITH US ON THIS SAID BY BY THE WAY THERE'S THIS THIS ENTITY. THAT'S TRYING TO IMPACT ARE ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COUNTING CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE THIS CAMPAIGN GOING ON. AND THE CITY GO ONLINE IF YOU FIND IN THIS WHO THEY ARE. BUT TWO DAYS LATER THE PRESIDENT I'D STATES. WAS COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING BAD PUBLICITY AND THE AND THE TRADITIONAL MEDIA AND HE SAID IF YOU WANT TO GO TO A REAL SOURCE FOR INFORMATION WHICH THE SOURCE. CODE THAT GO TO THIS ONE AND IT WAS THE SAME. SITE YEAH THAT WAS PROMOTING THIS SO THAT'S THE TYPE OF THING THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AND CERTAINLY FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ON THE GROUND. YOUR TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SOME PEOPLE USE FOR LITTLE ROBOTS TO DO THIS. BUT THEY USE ROBOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT SIR SO OUR VIEW IS GOING TO BE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WORKING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. TO MITIGATE THAT INFORMATION AND ALSO ON THAT PORTAL. YEAH AS THE MISINFORMATION YEAH ALSO ON THAT PORTAL AS FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING ON THE GROUND WITH THE B. C. B. O. TO OTHERS. THEY CAN GO ON THAT PORTAL AND SAY HEY I LEARNED OF THIS AND THEN OUR TEAM CAN. ATTACK THAT IMMEDIATELY. THE IDEA TO IS TO USE A TEN FOUR MESSAGE. SO YES IT IS TO MITIGATE YES IT IS TO GET AHEAD OF THINGS AND TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE GROUND BUT IT'S THAN FOR US TO SAY OKAY WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING. BECAUSE SOMETIMES. IF IT'S NOT MALICIOUS IT'S JUST SOMEBODY SHARING SOMETHING THAT THEY THOUGHT WHAT'S TRUE. AND. YOU KNOW BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY'S OUT THERE TO HURT THEY JUST THINK THEY'RE SHARING SOMETHING THAT'S FACTUAL. WE WANT TO HAVE MAKE SURE THAT WE THEN TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND UTILIZE IT AS A TOOL TO EDUCATE. IN A WAY THAT'S POSITIVE AND HELPS SURE THE RIGHT INFORMATION THE KIND WHERE IS A CONFUSION OUT THERE YEAH AND WE GET A HELL YEAH. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MISS AND DEATH YEAH YEAH AND THEN AND A SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS BACK IN THE DISTRICT IS THE INPUT AND I'D REPRESENT. GOOGLE AND YOUTUBE AND SOME IS I COMPANIES. IS THE IMPORTANCE OF PUSHING OUT POSITIVE ACCURATE MESSAGING EARLIER. SO THAT WHEN THEIR ALGORITHMS YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SEARCH FOR CERTAIN THINGS. THOSE POP UP HIGHER. YOU KNOW AHEAD OF TIME SO NOT EVEN YOU KNOW NOT NECESSARILY WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO GET THAT OUT TO GETTING THAT OUT EARLY SO THAT IT'S ALREADY COUNTY CUED UP. WITH THEIR ALGORITHMS SO THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT THE SEARCH RESULTS FIND. LAST QUICK QUESTION SO I KNOW THE SERVICE THAT CURRENT CENSUS WEBSITE. INCLUDES A CHAT BOT THAT PROVIDES HELPFUL INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. DOES MERCURY PLANNED INCLUDED CHAT BOT FEATURE. I GUESS THE CURRENT ABOUT THE ONLY. PROVIDES THIS ISN'T AN ENGLISH DO FUTURE PLANS INCLUDE MAKING THIS FEATURE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES OTHER THAN JUST ENGLISH AND POSSIBLY SPANISH SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE AND AT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW THAT POT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WERE REVIEWING AND HOW DO WE INCORPORATE THAT BOUGHT FROM THE STATE SITE TO THE MORE CONSUMER CAN'T CAMPAIGN COMMUNICATIONS. I AND WE WILL DO THAT WE WILL HAVE A BOT AND IT WILL BE AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES I'M AND IT FELT GOOD NEWS AS THE BOX GET SMARTER. HE IS THE IF IT'S AS GOOD AS THE INFORMATION YOU PUT IN IT SO WE HAVE A STRATEGY THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW ON HOW TO BUILD OUT NOW. AND WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THAT PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY AND HOW TO INTEGRATE IT AS WE LAUNCH THE WEBSITE IN SEPTEMBER GREAT. TO FOLKS ON THE GROUND PROVIDE INPUT ON THAT OR IS OUR PROCESS FOR THAT YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN THAT IF YOU MEAN CAN THEY SHARE WITH US QUESTIONS THE QUESTIONS OR WHAT THEY THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL THERE ARE. ONLY THE MORE INFORMATION WEEKEND. I MEAN IT WAS NICE YESTERDAY GOING TO AN EVENT WHERE I BASICALLY ASKED LET PEOPLE ASK QUESTIONS YEAH AND IT HELPS ME WALK AWAY FEELING MORE INFORMED ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN OUR PLAN TO ASSIST EVERYBODY NOT JUST THE STATE. YEAH EVERYBODY IN THIS PROJECT SO I'VE YES THE MORE INFORMATION. WE CAN GET THE BETTER GREAT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN COME LONGER OF. GREAT THANK YOU IT'S- YOU KNOW AN HONOR TO SIT ON A SELECT COMMITTEE WHERE IN YOU ARE GRACED WITH THE PRESENCE. OF ONE OF OUR- AMAZING FORMER SPEAKERS I HOPE WHEN HE CAME IN YOU ALL DIM THE LIGHTS. WE ONLY DO THAT AT THE MARK WALK AT THE CHURCH THE LIVES THAT. AND THEN TO HAVE HIM HERE AT WITH THE SURROUNDED BY STRONG INDEPENDENT THINKING WOMEN GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT I THINK WE'RE IN FOR A SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY. THANK YOU HAD TO GET THAT OUT I HAD. ONE COMMON INTO QUESTIONS YOU KNOW LISTENING TO THE PRESENTATIONS. IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU KNOW. WE'RE EMBARKING ON AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO CALIFORNIA RIGHT WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE CENSUS IN THE COUNT. YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND YET WE'RE DOING THIS IN THE STATE AND SO I'M I'M WONDERING AND ALSO FEELS LIKE WE'RE KIND OF GEARING UP TO GO TO WAR RIGHT. SO THAT'S PRETTY DISTURBING GIVEN WHAT THE OUTCOME OF THE CENSUS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT WHICH IS THE DELIVERY OF FEDERAL RESOURCES. SO MY ONE QUESTION WAS HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO KIND OF HELPING FOLKS SEE THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S ALMOST LIKE IT'S OUR ACCOUNT OUR CALIFORNIA WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT OUR STATE RIGHT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNT IS ACCURATE. SO HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF STRATEGIC THOUGHT AROUND HOW TO HELP PEOPLE SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEN YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN PROACTIVELY AND POSITIVELY SORT OF WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND. FOLKS THINK THAT THIS IS THAT IT'S VERY DIFFERENT WHY WE'RE DOING THIS WE'RE DOING IT TO GET OUR FAIR SHARE ARE ALSO DOING IT BECAUSE IT'S OUR ACCOUNTANTS ARE CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW IT'S OUR PEOPLE. I OF WILSHIRE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I ACTUALLY WE ARE ACTUALLY EXPLORING NOTHING BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES AND IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES CALIFORNIA IS SEEN AS INSPECTION NO WORRY STATE AND THEY ACTUALLY DO FEEL SAFE THEY DO FEEL PART OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO LEARN FROM THE LGBT COMMUNITY THEY ALSO FEEL THAT CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED A VERY SAFE HAVEN PER SE. THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE WHO THEY ARE ANOTHER ANOTHER COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO WANT TO EMBRACE AND SORT OF PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THIS IS FOR CALIFORNIA THIS IS FOR YOU THIS IS FOR YOUR CHILDREN FOR THE CALIFORNIANS AND TO SAY THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT AND THAT WE ALSO WANT TO SORT OF. YOU KNOW WE WANNA RESOURCES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE YOU KNOW PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIA ON NOT ONLY IN THE RESOURCE LEVEL BUT WE'RE ALSO SHOULD ONE NEED TO EDUCATE FOLKS BECAUSE OTHER PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FEDERALLY FUNDED OR STATE ALSO USE CENSUS DATA TO INFORM THE PROGRAM MEET AND ALLOCATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THERE'S A LOT EDUCATION THAT WERE WANTING TO BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WERE EXPLORING. DURING THIS PHASE. NOT TO SAID SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR CASH TWO YEARS. AND IT'S BEEN RIGHT UP FRONT AND WE STILL I STILLHAVE TO CONTINUE TO ALWAYS SEPARATE BECAUSE WE SHOULD DO TRY TO INVITE OUR SENSES PARTNERS TO THESE MEETINGS. THROUGH ALL THE CONVENES WE DID THE TWENTY FOUR LAST YEAR WAS ALWAYS THEY WERE THERE BUT IT IS VERY CLEAR WE'RE FROM THE STATE THIS IS WHY WE'RE DOING IT. THEY'RE IN CHARGE OF THE YOU KNOW THE ACTUAL OPERATIONS AND I THINK I'VE BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THE FATE OF OUR STATE IN THE HANDS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF OUR PARTNERS THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ON BOARD WITH THAT BUT WEEK AS WE CONTINUE TO DO THIS EDUCATION MOTIVATION WE CONTINUE THAT MESSAGE. OF LIKE. YES IT'S A FEDERAL OPERATION AND THE REASON WHY CALIFORNIA UNLIKE MANY OTHER STATES IS REALLY STEPPING UP TO A VERY HIGH TUNE IS BECAUSE OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE AT RISK OF ARMIES HAVE A LOT TO LOSE AND THE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR THE FACT THAT WE ARE HAVEN AND THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THE CALLS ALL KINDS OF YOU KNOW. CALL ME FOR YEAH THERE'S A LOT OF THE OTHER A. B. C. AND D. SEES THAT FOR ANYTHING BUT CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THAT AND OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THROUGH THE CAN MEANS THAT WE'RE DOING AND THROW PARTNERS WE CONTINUE TO DIFFERENTIATE. EVEN THOUGH THE US CENSUS BUREAU TIRING PARTNERSHIP SPECIALS ON THE GROUND. YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE SAY YOUR WHAT THE US CENSUS BUREAU THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO ORGANIZE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT. IT FROM THE QUARTER DC. IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW. VERY YOU KNOW COHEN AND WE'RE GONNA TELL YOU WHAT WE NEED TO DO FOR THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW. THANK I'M FOR THAT BECAUSE THE REALITY IS YOU KNOW NOT EVERYONE IS TRUSTING WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO IF WE WANTED. GET WHAT'S DUE TO US RIGHT. THOSE I ALSO HOPE I KNOW DOCTOR PAN IS MAYBE HOPING THAT HE WILL BE IN ONE OF THE NOVELLAS AND SO HE OFFERED. THAT. BUT AND THAT'S GREAT AND YOU HAVE YOUR WALK ON. BUT AS WERE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT INNOVATIVE WAYS HOPEFULLY WERE ALSO I'LL HOPEFULLY WE'RE ALSO. HOPEFULLY I KNOW HOPEFULLY WERE ALSO THINKING ABOUT OTHER YOU KNOW INFLUENCERS EVERYTHING FROM LIKE HOW PEOPLE GET AROUND IF IT'S AN UBER LAUGHTER OTHER THESE OTHER MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND SORT OF WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE GROUPS TO. SOME OF THE MORE AND I HAD TO KIND OF. BE A COMMERCIAL FOR ANYONE BUT EVEN SOME OF THE BRANDS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA LIKE SUPREME AND SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT HELP YOUNG PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW TO KIND OF CONNECT WITH THEM THOSE KINDS OF CULTURAL INFLUENCERS. ARE REALLY IMPORTANT OF THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS AND YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY SO I'M JUST HOPING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OPPORTUNITIES AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT THE ADA COMMUNITY HOPEFULLY WERE REACHING OUT TO WEST SIDE REGIONAL CENTERS ARE REGIONAL CENTER SORRY THAT'S IN MY DISTRICT. BUT WORKING WITH THEM AND OTHER PARTNERS TO GET THE WORD OUT BUT MY SECOND. QUESTION WAS. AND I THANK YOU FOR SAYING THE TAKE AWAY WORD IS NIMBLE. AND IT'S EVIDENT THAT YOU ALL. ARE YOU YOU KNOW. ACTIVELY USING THAT WORD AN INTENTION MY QUESTION IS. AND MY HOPE IS THAT THE STATE IS ALSO GOING TO BE NIMBLE BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING. IF YOU ALL HAVE YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND YOU'RE BEING RESPONSIVE AND REFLEXIVE AND YOU'RE DEALING WITH WHATEVER KIND OF HOSTILE FAKE NEWS IS COMING FROM OTHER PLACES. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING IF YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THE GAME THAT'S BEING NIMBLE AND THEN THE STATE IS NOT SO CAN YOU SORT OF TALK ABOUT. THE NEED ON THAT END AND HOW WE CAN ON THIS COMMITTEE AND IN OUR WORK MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING GOOD PARTNERS IN THIS BECAUSE. RIGHT I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IF I MAY FIRST OF ALL OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW. I THINK THAT THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION. FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY STRONG. IT TYPICALLY WITH THE WITH AN ISSUE LIKE THIS YOU DEAL WITH THE CONTRACTING AGENCY IT'S VERY BUREAUCRATIC HERE'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO HERE'S WHAT WE EXPECT THIS THESE ARE YOUR- THE OBJECTIVES YOU MEET YOU NEED TO MEET HERE YOUR DEADLINE SUBMIT YOUR STUFF AND THAT'S AND MOVE FORWARD ON THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY COOPERATIVE OF VERY PRO ACTIVE. CAMPAIGN WHERE THE STATE HAS BEEN CERTAINLY IN TERMS OF OUR OWN INTERACTION HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY A COOPERATIVE AND I THINK IT'S REFLECTIVE OF THAT SAME SPIRIT OF WANTING TO GET THIS DONE I ALSO WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY GROUPS OF THAT HAVE BEEN ALREADY ON THE GROUND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LITTLE BIT WITH SOME OF THEM I THINK THERE THERE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF. UNEASINESS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET GOING AND I THINK THAT'S VERY HEALTHY TENSION WHICH WE LOOK WE NEED WE WANT TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE THERE'S THINGS THAT ALREADY GOING ON THAT WE'RE GOING TO LEARN FROM YOU KNOW THE ONE THING THAT YOU CAN REST ASSURE ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ISN'T THIS WILL NOT BE A TOP DOWN. A CAMPAIGN THIS IN OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE SOME TOP DOWN BUT THERE WILL BE A LOT OF BOTTOM UP AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE KIND OF TEAM THAT IS READY AND WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES TO ADAPT TO THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT COME UP. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. BOB. 80% OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. IS GONNA BE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FOLLOW AT IN TRACK. THE REST YOU HAVE TO CALL US INTO A HEARING LIKE THIS SO THAT WE CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT I FEEL THAT THE YOU HAVE A GREAT TEAM IN PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND CERTAINLY. WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED ALREADY. I BELIEVE ARE EXCEPTIONAL GROUPS AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WAR THE BEST MESSENGERS. IT'LL THESE GROUPS WILL TELL US WHO THE BEST MESSENGERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE GOING TO BE. AND WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. YOU KNOW WE RUN A STRONG CAMPAIGN. ON THAT WE CAN LOOK BACK ON AND BE PROUD OF. YEAH I WANTED TO ANSWER AND- I AGREE WITH WHAT. BY THE END HAS INDICATED AND- I WANNA AND- ENHANCE THAT AND THEN ANSWER YOUR- ONE OF. THE SECOND QUESTION THAT YOU HAD. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID AND ACTUALLY WAS LIKE. MY FIRST DAY AND THE JOB WAS DOING CONTRACTS NEGOTIATION WITH MERCURY AND THAT WAS REALLY TOP OF. MINE AND WHEN I SAID WERE FULLY EQUIPPED AT THAT WE WERE FULLY AWARE THAT FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. WE COULDN'T TREAT YOU. TREAT IT LIKE A PUBLIC HEALTH CAMPAIGN ALL SOCIAL SERVICES AND I KNOW AND- KIND OF SORT OF HIGHLIGHTED MY PREVIOUS LIFE BUT- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CONTRACT. AND THEIR ABILITIES AND SKILLS SAID ALLOWED US TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE KNEW WE DO. NEED IT TO BE. A NEED TO BE NIMBLE AND STRATEGIC. AND EFFECTIVE. SO WE'RE NOT JUST ROLLING NOW BUT JOKE COLLATERAL MATERIALS WITHOUT DOING OUR HOMEWORK. AND THAT'S WHY THIS PHASE AND AUGUST. AS OUR DATA COLLECTION PERIOD. AND WE'RE LAYING OUT A LOT OF METRICS FOR YOU GUYS TO FOLLOW AND- REVIEW. I KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR A LOT OF YOU. THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE REASON WHY WE PICK MERCURY IS THEY HAD THIS REALLY NICE. AND THEY WILL DO THIS MICRO REGIONAL APPROACH. THAT WILL FULLY EQUIPPED EVERY REGION. AND THEY WILL ALSO TAYLOR THOSE MESSAGES. AND EACH REGION ARE IN EACH COMMUNITY SO FOR EXAMPLE A MESSAGE IN SAN DIEGO WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT AND HUMBLED. A MESSAGE IN CENTRAL VALLEY WILL LOOK VERY DIFFERENT THAN SALINAS ARE WATSONVILLE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT WERE VERY MUCH MINDFUL AND ALSO. THAT BURKE CREEK. CAN FULLY AND EXECUTE IN A TIMELY MATTER. I'D LIKE TO SHARE ONE. THING THAT WAS VERY CLEAR AS WHEN WE FIRST. WHY AM WENT THROUGH THE RP PROCESS AND THEN WE WERE AWARDED THE CONTRACT OUR FIRST DELIVERABLE WITH OUR CALMS PLAN. AND OUR REQUIREMENT WAS ONE COMES PLAN. WE AND THE STATE WORK TOGETHER TO SAY. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WITH THIS TYPE OF A PLAN SO IT WAS A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TWO ENTITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO BE NIMBLE AND REACTIVE TO WHAT WE NEED AND NOT JUST SAYING THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS DO IT AND SO YES WE CONTINUE TO WORK THAT WAY TOGETHER AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SO THAT WE CAN BE. I THINK TRULY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND MEASURED AND. BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK TO YOU REAL TANGIBLE RESULTS. IF I CAN ALSO NOT TO NOT TO GO ON FOREVER BECAUSE I KNOW CENTER HERTZBERG IS REALLY BUSY ANY AND HE NEEDS TO GO SOMEWHERE. BOB THE. SERVICE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PIE APOLOGIZE FOR THAT CALM AND HE'S HE WANTED ME TO SAY THAT THE A QUESTION OF WHEN THE QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT MEDIA BUYS I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE TRADITIONAL WAY OF DOING MEDIA BITES CERTAINLY FOR FOLKS THAT ARE YOU KNOW WHETHER IN THE PUBLIC AFFAIRS AGENCIES YOU KNOW EVEN POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS YOU KNOW YOU BUY THAT YOU BUY THOSE AHEAD OF TIME AND YOU PAY FOR. IT THE EARLIER YOU BY YOUR MEDIA AS YOU KNOW BETTER RATE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE CLOSER TO THE ELECTION THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO PAY WE WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCE AT AND ONE AND ONE WAY OR ANOTHER WHAT WE'RE ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AS THEY WERE PART OF OUR ACT ACTUALLY THEY WERE PART OF OUR PROCESS AND IT'S PART OF THAT THEY HAD TO SIGN AN AGREEMENT WITH US THAT. THEY COULD SIGN WITH ANYBODY ELSE INCIDENTLY. AS WELL. BUT PART OF OUR AGREEMENT WITH THEM IS THAT BOB WE'RE GONNA GET THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK. ON EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS SPENT ON THE AIRWAVES OUR WEATHER'S RADIO TV ARE DIGITAL MEDIA A BUYS YOU KNOW SOCIAL MEDIA EXCEPT FOR. AND THEY'RE ALSO AS OUR PARTNERS ARE GOING TO DO MORE CONTENT SO YOU MENTION TELENOVELAS YOU KNOW WHEN WE WHEN WE HAVE MERCURY DID THE CAMPAIGN WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF FOR THE CALIFORNIA DOMINANT. ONE OF THINGS WE DID WITH UNIVISION IN THAT PARTNERSHIP IS THEY HAD TO EMBED EVERYTHING THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND EVERY ONE OF THEIR PROBE ALL THE PROGRAMMING WHERE THEY STILL HAD INFLUENCE SO IF THEY WERE. YOU OF IT BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF IS DONE YOU KNOW YEAR HAD A TIME OR TWO BUT AND ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS GOING UP. TO UNIVISION WHAT WAS ON THE RADIO OR WHETHER WAS BEEN. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN AND MESSAGING AT THE WAY WE WANTED THAT TO BE MESSAGE. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WERE SO SUCCESSFUL IN THIS BED QUITE FRANKLY NOT TO BE BOLD BUT TO SAY THAT WE WENT INTO THIS. WITH MEDIA PARTNERS. KNOWING THAT WE SAID TO THE MEDIA PARTNERSNUMBER ONE YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE US A HUGE DEAL HUGE BREAK ON THE COST. AND NUMBER TWO YOU'RE GONNA SPEND A LOT OF YOUR OWN MONEY PROMOTING THE CENSUS BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU CAN DO SOME OF THIS ALREADY. AROUND THE FRINGES BUT WE WANT YOU TO GO DEEPER AND SO IT ALL OF IN ALL OF THESE AREAS IN THE STATE PARTICULARLY AND WHAT IN THE MEDIA MARKET IS CONSIDERED. SECONDARY MARKET NOT SECONDARY OBVIOUSLY EVERYTHING'S. PRIMARY NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT CENTRAL VALLEY YOU KNOW THE RIVERSIDE SAMBAR DINO AREA IMPERIAL VALLEY ETCETERA. IN THOSE MARKETS. BOB WE'VE GOT BOB MEDIA PARTNERS THAT ARE GOING TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND GO TO WORK EVEN WHILE THEY WERE WHILE WE'RE NOT PAYING THEM. SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU THAT THAT THAT THAT YOU WANT. AND THAT AND THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU. WELL THE THANK YOU AND THAT BEFORE I RECOGNIZE THAT ARE THERE ALSO I MEAN IF TO GO BUT I WOULDN'T WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU OF THIS CAT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP OF FORTUNATELY FOR YOU ALL OF US HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH MEDIA IN ELECTIONS IN COMMUNICATION SO WHERE ALL EXPERTS AND WE'RE PERFECTLY PREPARED AN ANXIOUS TO SECOND GUESS YOU THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE CAMPAIGN AND I KNOW YOU'LL COME BACK WITH WITH EVIDENCE BASED COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES SO YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE US. THE MOST EFFICACIOUS WAY TO COMMUNICATE THESE MESSAGES AND THEN LASTLY TO APPOINTMENT EARLIER IT IF BY THE WAY IF I DON'T GET ANY ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISING DIRECTOR ME YOU DON'T SHOW UP ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THEY DO THAT TRAINING I'LL BE PERFECTLY CONTENT FACT I'LL FEEL LIKE YOU'RE DOING YOUR JOB BECAUSE OF LEGISLATORS. OR IN A HARD TO COUNT CATEGORY WORLD HOST. THANK THANK YOU SENATOR ALSO ELEMENT TURN OVER TO CHEER BERMAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE WHAT'S MOST IMPRESSIVE ABOUT WHAT YOUR YOUR YOUR PRESENTATION. WITH THE THIS WE'VE BEEN WE'VE GONE THROUGH NUMEROUS HEARINGS AND MEETINGS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE FEEL LIKE IT'S BEING INCORPORATED SO YOU WERE LISTENING. NOT JUST TO US BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY TO ALL THE- STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAME THROUGH DAY AFTER DAY WITH WITH THEIR IDEAS SO A COUPLE OF AREAS OF THE HAVEN'T SPECIFICALLY BEEN. ADDED OR OR LISTED IS. FOR ME AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY AND ONLY A LOT AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. IN FACT WHEN HE COMES TO CIVIC PARTICIPATION THE FIRST SECOND THIRD GENERATIONS ARE MANY TIMES THE HARDER. PARTS OF OUR ALL OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY TO INVOLVED IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND THIS IS A FORM OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. AND THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR OTHER IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHEN YOU GET INTO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE A LONGER AND SEVERAL GENERATIONS IS THE DIFFICULTY. IN REACHING THEM IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME MESSAGE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT TODAY BUT I JUST. YOU KNOW. I HOPE AND EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN APPROACH THAT INCORPORATES OR MAYBE DISTINGUISHES THEM AS FAR AS THE MESSAGE. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME MESSAGE. MAYBE IT'S THE MEDIUM THE ACTUAL MEDIA OF APPROACH BUT IT IS REALLY DIFFERENT AND THAT WHAT WE CALL AS THE CHICANO COMMUNITY IS NOT THE SAME. AS THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SORRY I WANNA BRING THAT OUT I THINK THEY ARE THE LARGEST. IN TERMS OF NUMBERSIN PERCENTAGE THE LARGEST OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY NOT THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY SO THAT'S WHEN THEY WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION A SECOND IS WE PUSHED REALLY HARD IN OUR- SUBCOMMITTEE ON. ON THE BUDGET PUSHED REALLY HARD FOR SCHOOLS. TO BE UP INCLUDED IN THIS WE RAISE THE BUDGET A LITTLE BIT MORE TO REACH THEM BUT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE COMMUNITY IN THE ENTIRE STATE. THAT DOESN'T HELP THE SCHOOL. I DON'T CARE HOW HARD YOU ARE TO COUNT. YOUR KIDS GO TO A SCHOOL. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO GET THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. OF THAT WILL REACH THE PARENTS INVOLVED IN THIS AND I KNOW IN TERMS OF ORGAN IS ORGANIZING AND REACHING OUT TO THEM BUT IS THERE A WAY. OF THROUGH OUR- BROADLY SPEAKING COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY THE GETS TO THEM IT WOULD BE A REAL SHAME AND I KNOW THEY'LL BE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT INVEST AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE TRUTH IS I DON'T THINK WITH WHAT THEIR PRIMARY MISSION IS WHICH IS EDUCATION. I DON'T THINK THEY'LL PUT THE ENERGY AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT SO I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. AND THE OF COURSE YOUNG ADULTS. WHERE WOULD SECRETARY BY THE A HE'S REACHED OUT TO YOUNG ADULTS THEY NOW CAN REGISTER TO VOTE BEFORE THEY'RE EVEN ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AND THERE IS I THINK A AN ANXIOUSNESS ON THEIR PART TO BE INVOLVED. THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED HOW DO WE TAP OF THAT YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S THROUGH. THE ENTERTAINMENT MEDIA. SOME SOME WAY THAT THIS THAT THEY CAN BE INVOLVED IN THIS THE INCARCERATED. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE. WHAT IT YOU KNOW THE LEGALITIES I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO THAT BUT- WE ARE ALL TRYING VERY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH INCARCERATED FORMALLY INCARCERATED. BUT THE INSTITUTIONS. OF THAT HAVE INCARCERATED OUR COMMUNITIES IS THERE A WAY OF INCLUDING THEM WE WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE COMMITTEES WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS. YOU KNOW NOT PART OR FROM DIFFERENT OF SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME AND THEN TO MORE IS THE- I REALLY APPRECIATE THE YOUR UP. REALLY CONNECTEDNESS HERE BETWEEN DETERS TEAM AND EVERYONE THERE ON THE GROUND AND YOURSELVES YOU TALK ABOUT BEING NIMBLE. AND I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ALL THE DETAILS BUT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD GET FROM MESSI. OF THE COORDINATION WITH THE ORGANIZERS YOU TALKED ABOUT YOURSELVES DIRECTLY BEING THERE ON THE GROUND I THINK THAT'S GREAT IF YOU DON'T FEEL TOUCH YEAR. YOU KNOW SMELL WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE GROUND IT'S- YOU WILL BE DISCONNECTED. BUT ALSO FEAR FOR. SO MUCH SO THAT WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE. SO JUST ONE SORT OF CAUTION AND FINALLY NOT FINALLY OF THE TRAININGS AND LEARNING SESSIONS ANA I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WILL FIT IN ON DOING TRAININGS ON THE GROUND ON THE MESSAGE AND AS WELL AS LEARN FROM THOSE TRAINING SESSIONS. AND FINALLY FINALLY. I KNOW YOU YOU'VE MENTIONED LEGISLATORS AS WELL AS EVERYBODY SHOULD BE DOING WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN ALL THIS BUT I WOULD LIKE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE AN ACTUAL PROGRAM FOR US WITH THE TIME FRAME AS TO WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. NOT JUST LIKE OKAY ASSEMBLYMAN BERMAN YOU HE'S GOING TO GO OFF AND DO HIS THINGS CENTER POUNDS GONNA DO HIS THING CAN WE BE PUT ON A. TIME FRAME IN THIS SORT OF. PROGRAM YOU KNOW CARRY IT OUT SO WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE REALLY CONTRIBUTING AND NOT JUST COMING OUT OF. NUMBER THANK YOU. I HAVE TO ANSWER A LITTLE RIGHT NOW BUT. GAS ONE. YEAH WELL ANSWER A COUPLE OF THEM BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT COUPLE OF THEM FOR THE LET THE NOW WE AGREE WITH YOU WERE NOT OUT ALL ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL PARTICULAR SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION AND EVEN FOURTH GENERATION EVEN THE WAY WE SPEAK. CHICANOS AND EVEN RECENT SECOND GENERATION THE SPANGLISH LANGUAGE HAS BEEN MORE OF US SOCIALIZED WAY OF US COMMUNICATING. TEXTING LANGUAGE IS THE WAY THAT WE COMMUNICATE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE NOTES ARE. REALLY HIGH CONSUMERS OF VARIOUS MARKET SO WE ARE EXPLORING ALL THOSE DIFFERENT IDEAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M SORRY HAVE MY BACK TO YOU AND BUT THIS IS WHAT WERE WERE SORT OF EXPLORING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE CONGRUENCY THAT'S PART OF SORT OF THE- ANALYZING AND THAT SORT OF EXPLORING. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THE MESSAGE IS THERE. WE TALK ABOUT ETHNIC MEDIA IS NOT JUST AN LANGUAGE WERE ALSO SEEN THAT ENGLISH MEDIA. OR JUST TRADITIONAL MEDIA IS WORD THEY'RE REACHING LET THE NELSON PARTICULARLY SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WERE WERE LOOKING AT. SO ETHNIC MEDIA IS NOT JUST AN LANGUAGE BUT ALSO THINKING ABOUT NOT JUST FOR LATINOS BUT ALSO ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS NATIVE AMERICANS. TO ENSURE THAT THAT MESSAGE GETS TO THEM AND A VERY COOL TREE CONGRUENT WAY WHETHER IF THEIR. SECOND THIRD OR FOURTH GENERATION. ON. IN ON SCHOOLS I HAVE THIS IS WHERE WERE LEANING INTO THE US CENSUS AT AS WE KICK OFF THE CAMPAIGN THEY ARE GOING INTO. THE TOP TEN COUNTIES ACROSS THE NATION AND DOING A BIG SCHOOL PROGRAM AND I LA COUNTY IS ACTUALLY. GOING TO BE ONE OF THINGY COUNTIES THAT THE US CENSUS IS REALLY DIVING INTO THEIR IN DURING A PROGRAM. SO WE WERE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN INTEGRATE AND OTHER COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE LA COUNTYSINCE THEY WOULD BE WORKING WITH THE US CENSUS. TO HELP DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT IN OTHER COMMUNITIES SO WE TO AGREE THAT SCHOOLS ARE CRITICAL. AND WITH YOUNG ADULTS WE THINK THAT THAT'S- I'M CAROLYN MENTIONED THE MULTI CULTURAL. I THINK IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AND I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THIS BUT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT. EVEN GETTING AN CONNECTING TO. OUR MODELING GOAL FAMILIES IS HAVING THE CONNECTION WITH EITHER OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ACTUALLY SPEAK SPANISH AT SPEAKING ENGLISH. AND SO WE WILL HAVE A ENGLISH COMPONENTS SPECIALLY WITH YOUNG ADULTS AND COLLEGE H. M. S. STUDENTS. I'M AT ITS JUST BECAUSE THAT COMMUNITY REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE AN EMPHASIS SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNTED ON BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN BECAUSE ARE NOT AT HOME. AND ALSO THEY CAN HELP THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BE COUNTED. CENTER JUST WANNA JUST OVER FOR SO I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE ADDITIONAL DOLLARS GOING TO OUR- OF OUR SCHOOLS. OUTREACH PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW WAY BACK IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE GOT WE JUST GOT THAT THREE MILLION. THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS DEDICATE DOLLARS TO CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT WHERE FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TOOK THE CREEK THEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL OF AND SAID LET'S BRING TEACHERS IN FIFTH EIGHTH ELEVEN TWELVE GREAT BECAUSE THAT CIVICS. TO REALLY INTEGRATE IN THAT AND SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ROLLING THAT OUT ACROSS THE STATE AND THERE I NOTICED SOME SOME. FOLKS HERE FROM FRESNO COUNTY THEY'RE ALSO PART OF THAT PILOT BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO BETTER COORDINATE THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS BUT ALSO AS SORT OF A HIGHER LEVEL BECAUSE- FOR ME HAVING THIS IS MY THIRD TIME. THE THING THAT'S GOING TO REALLY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IS ARE YOU. AND SO WE WERE HAVING CONVERSATION ABOUT U. G. C. USER GENERATED CONTENT MY DAUGHTER SIXTEEN SHE MAKES VIDEOS ALL THE TIME KNOWN ON TOPICS FROM YOU KNOW THE LIBERATORS IN CENTRAL AMERICA. TO CENSUS THEY'RE DOING CRAP SO DOING ALL THESE GREAT THINGS SO WE'RE PLANNING ON DOING VIDEO CONTENTS WITH GROUPS LIKE USING GOVERNMENT AND OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE. THAT ARE ARE YOU DOING THAT THAT'S REALLY KIND OF MARRYING UP THE GROUND SORT OF ORGANIZATION WITH THE SCHOOLS AND THE YOUTH AND THEN ALSO MEDIA. BUT I AGREE IT'S THAT THAT COORDINATING OUR PARTNERS ARE AMAZING AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY REALLY HARD AND NOW IT'S REALLY ABOUT US SAYING HEY. LET'S LET'S. IS. OBVIOUSLY YOU WE'RE GOING TO BE NIMBLE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN SPECIALLY RIGHT NOW AS WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION BUT THERE WILL BE A VERY NOT GONNA SIX STRIX DRUCKER BUT IT CERTAINTY THAT WILL BE A VERY OUTLINES STRUCTURE THAT FOLKS WILL WILL BE WORKING WITH UNDER BECAUSE IT'S TOO BIG A CAMPAIGN FOR IT NOT TO BE I MEAN IT'S THE SO MANY DEAL FIFTY TWO COUNTIES. THIRTY EIGHT OF FIFTY EIGHT OR THE EIGHT COUNTIES ALL THE ACE AND THE OWES DOESN'T SAY SEE BILLS AND THEN ALL THE CBO SYMBOLIC MEAN THIS IS. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL OPERATION AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE. IN A- DUE TO THE MARK THAT ONE SAYS BUT THE WEB WILL START WILL START CRACKING THAT WHIP BOB SOON SOON ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW YOU'LL SEE THAT. THINGS WILL BE MOVING THINGS WILL BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S WORK HERE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THIS LEADS THIS BODY HERE. WHEN EVERYBODY HAS BEEN ALSO SECRETARY PRETTY I IN IN HIS OFFICE MS BEEN VERY ENGAGED AND IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS AND- YOU KNOW WE FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. FOR SURE. THANK YOU ACTUALLY I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. SO I THINK THERE'S SOME QUESTION ABOUT INTERFACE WITH THE COUNTIES SO CERTAINLY KNOW THAT MERCURY HAS ALLOW LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH IN THE HARD TO COMMUNITIES. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COUNTIES WHO ACTION OR THE GAP WHO OF ALSO VERIFY THE GAPS ON THEIR OWN WILMER TO BE WORKING WITH THOSE COUNTIES WHO OPT IN FOR FUNDS AS WELL AND HOW AND ALSO FOR EXAMPLE WHOSE MONEY IS GONNA GET USED. FOR THAT THING SO SAMPLE SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH I REPRESENT THE WORD ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE USED THEIR OWN OUT REACH FUNDS FOR MEDIA OR WILL THAT BE IT'S AT. THE CIRCLE K. IDENTIFIES MEDIA OPPORTUNITY THAT. THEY WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH MERCURY AND YOU CAN USE THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED FOR MEDIA OUT REACH INSTEAD OF THEIR OWN OUT REACH FUNDS. YEAH THANKS FOR THE QUESTION SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE REVIEWING THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS THAT HAS THE COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES SO. ACROSS THE STATE EVERYONE HAS ALLOCATED COMMUNICATIONS FUNDS DIFFERENTLY THERE'S NOT A SET FORMULA. SO WE'RE REVIEWING THAT AND WE WILL BE PROVIDING TANGIBLE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO BEST USE OR DOLLARS OR EVEN PROVIDE. SORT OF SUPPORT ON THEIR ACTIVITIES TURN SURE IT'S EFFECTIVE. SO IT'S NOT A SET FORMULA BUT- MERCURY IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING THAT LOCAL SUPPORT. IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS BUT ALSO MEDIA COVERAGE I DO WANT TO SAY THAT MERCURY. WITH THEIR PAID MEDIA THEY WILL COVER EVERY SINGLE REGION ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS A GIVEN. WHAT WE NEED TO COORDINATE AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE LOCALS IS WHEN THE SCHEDULING AND IN TERMS OF SATURATION WHAT THAT WILL LOOK LIKE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO ENSURE THERE'S NO DUPLICATION OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THE THING I'M HERE SO. IN TERMS OF SO WITH YOU WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE STRATEGIC PLANS WHOSE IS THERE AN EXPECTATION OF THE COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THEIR OWN OUT REACH MONEY ON MEDIA ARE I MEAN THAT I MEAN THIS COMES DOWN TO LIKE YOU KNOW THE DATE. SO THEY SAY OKAY LOOK YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE SEGMENT OF COUNTY YOU KNOW WE'VE A LARGE P. I COMMUNITY WEWILL WE IDENTIFY THIS IS BEING A HARD COUNTY AREA WE NEED. TO BE OUT REACH FOR THAT ARE YOU GOING TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THEM. IT STILL IS NOT THE WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE LIKE AN ACTUAL DOLLAR IF THAT'S THE QUESTION ARE. OR A SPECIFIC YOU KNOW. WE STILL AT IT THERE'S SO EVERYBODY HAS BUDGET THEIR COMMUNICATION DOLLARS DIFFERENTLY WHERE MERCURY IS GONNA SUPPORT IS THE COMPLETE BY ACROSS THE STATE SO THERE MIGHT THERE THEY WORLD BE FOR EXAMPLE I CAN PICK YOLO COUNTY BECAUSE WE JUST REVIEWED THEIR PLAN. THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO A MEDIA BY AND THEY'RE TALKING TO UNIVISION AND TELEMUNDO WE COORDINATED THEIR BY OR THEIR DOLLARS AND THEY'RE BUDGET WITH THE STATE WHAT THE STATE POTENTIALLY COULD DO AND WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERY SINGLE SORT OF FUNDING PARTNER. IN THE SAME FASHION SO EVERYBODY LOOKS REALLY DIFFERENCE OF SACRAMENTO ELSE BUDGET LOOKS VERY DIFFERENT THAN YELLOW AND VEHICLES IT'S GOING TO LOOK DIFFERENT SO MARK PRES. I THANK AT THAT YOU KNOW I GET THAT I GUESS WHAT I'M NOT CLEAR ABOUT IS THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID WELL WE'RE DOING STUFF ACROSS STATE YES. BUT I MEAN NOT EVERYTHING IS LIKE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST RUNNING ADS ACROSS THE STATE YOU'RE DOING SPECIFIC THINGS IN SPECIFIC AREAS. RIGHT THAT'S AND THEN WILL PART AT CETERA. SO WILL. SO HOW SO WHEN IT COMES TO THAT TARGETED MEDIA ACTIVITY. YEAH WE COUNTIES HAVE THIS FIJI PLANS YOU'RE RIGHT EVERYONE'S DIFFERENCES THAT COUNTIES ARE DIFFERENT AND OF THE COUNTY IDENTIFIES WORLD THERE'S AN AREA WE'D LIKE TO DO MEDIA. WHO PAYS FOR IT IS THAT THE COUNTY IT'S HAS TO PAY FOR IT IF THE THEY CALL I ARE ARE DO YOU WORK WITH THEM LIKE WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S A MEDIA BY SO THAT SHOULD THAT'S ACTUALLY PART OF. YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE YELL COMING OUT THE MERCURY SIDE OF THINGS SO A BLACK AND WHITE ANSWER IS IF THE COUNTY WANTS TO RUN ANY PI. CAMPAIGN AND WE ARE COORDINATING WITH THEM. IT WOULD BE THEIR FUNDING IF WE ARE WORKING ON A PROJECT AND WE'RE COORDINATING WITH THEM AND IT'S SOMETHING WE AGREED TO COLLABORATE ON AND WE HELP FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDS BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING IN THAT IT WOULD BE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT THEM. WE DON'T WANT TO SAY LIKE WE'RE NEVER GOING TO HELP A COUNTY OR A REGION WITH A PARTICULAR MESSAGE BECAUSE IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO AS PART OF OUR PLAN AND IT THEN COMPLIMENTS THEIR PLAN. BUT IF THEY HAVE A PLAN TO GO AFTER THAT WE WILL WORK WITH THEM TO HELP THEM ON THAT STRATEGIC COORDINATION WITH OUR PLAN BUT IT'S THEIR DOLLARS. OKAY I THINK WE NEED TO WORK THAT OUT BUT MORE. SO YEAH I MEAN IT IS THE FIRST OF ALL I DON'T EXPECT YOU JUST LIKE I WANNA PLAN HE'S GOT A CHECK FOR IT OR DO THE BUYER WHATEVER ELSE BUT- I. YOU KNOW I EIGHT. I THINK THAT THE OUT REACH MONEY FOR THE COUNTIES I MEAN WE'LL TALK THAT'S A SECOND OKAY I JUST GO PICK ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT. MEANS WE'RE GONNA PAY NEED MOST AFTER THE GROUND AND BUT THEY BUT DOES THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO COORDINATE BETWEEN GROUND AND- AIR. TO AIR WHATEVER ELSE YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S- AND SO I'M HOPING THAT AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE PLANS HAVING CONVERSATIONS OF THE COUNTIES THERE IS. A YOU KNOW THERE'S A DISCUSSION ABOUT. BECAUSE YOU ARE THEM YOU KNOW. YOU'VE BEEN CONTRACTED TO DO THE MEDIA WE BUDGETED FOR MEDIA. WE NEED. SO GET OUT YOUR TO YOUR TO COURT YOU'RE YOU'RE TO COORDINATOR FOR THAT DIDN'T BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WELL THAT MEANS ALL THE MEDIA ALL THE MEDIA MONEY CAN ONLY GO FOR LIKE THIS LARGER THING IT THEN THE CAN'T MISS NOT BEING HELP BEING USED TO HELP OUT AND LOCAL OUT REACH RIGHT AB PARTICULARLY WITH COUNTIES ARE OTHERS SO. I JUST WANNA BE SURE WERE. YOU KNOW WE AT THE DATA THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP THIS IS NOT LIKE WHAT WE HAVE OUR MEDIA PLAN RIGHT YOU AND YOUR ON YOUR OWN THAT IF YOU WANT TO ANY MEDIA THAT WE DIDN'T DECIDE TO READY BEFORE WE EVEN TALK TO YOU. THEN YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE THE MONEY TOGETHER FOR SENATOR PAN ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THE ANSWER IS TRICKY IS BECAUSE THERE'S GAP ANALYSIS UNDER WAY. RIGHT NOW RIGHT BOTH BY US BUT ALSO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND NOT I WITH A BORROWER TURN TO SEIZE LAST WEEK WE CAN TURN THIS GAPS AND OPPORTUNITIES SO IT'S REALLY THAT ANALYSIS THAT WE WANT TO ENSURE INFORMS US YET NEITHER ARE SENT. YEAH BUT THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES IN WHICH- ANY GIVEN COUNTY. YOU RECEIVE DOLLARS OF PART OF THOSE DOLLARS EVER DOING ALSO THERE WERE ALSO DUDE MEDIA SO. THINK OF IT AS THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PLAN. MAN THERE'S DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE PLAN WHICH SHOULD BE LAID OUT ALREADY IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WE'RE GONNA SAYS THAT PLAN. THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF THE STATE MEET. THE STATE WIDE MEDIA. IF THERE'S GAPS IN THAT PLAN. THAT THERE AREN'T ADDRESSING ALL THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE'RE GONNA COME IN AND WE'RE GONNA FORTIFY THAT. WITH WITH WITH MORE MEDIA BUYS INTO THOSE AREAS WE'RE NOT GONNA WRITE THEM A CHECK SAY HEY HERE'SA CHECK TO GO THE- BUT WE ARE GOING TO REINFORCE THE WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT. WITH THAT THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE ARE ARE SPENT EQUITABLY. OKAY WELL I JUST THINK THAT YOUNG. PERHAPS THE ON THEIR NEED. SOME CLARIFICATION AND DISCUSSION ABOUT SO THAT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW YOU ARE REVIEWING THE COUNTY PLANTS AND SO IN THAT IT IN THAT REVIEW IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS EXACTLY HOW WE SURE WE YOU KNOW EXECUTE ON D. DELTA PROBABLY MEDIA SUPPORT FOR THAT THAT THE GROUND EFFORTS ARE HAPPENING I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING AGAIN YOU WORK A LOT TO ME PARTNERS AND SO FORTH BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE. I THINK THERE'S A THROUGH THE PROCESS AND WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION THIS LAST HEARING I THINK THERE WERE SOME BAKERY ABOUT EXACTLY. KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT AND SO FORTH AND ALSO WHEN WE WHEN WE BUDGETED FOR MEDIA. WE WEREN'T SAYING THAT WELL NOW THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY ADDITIONAL MEDIA ON YOUR OWN AND IT'S NOW ALL BEEN CORDONED OFF SO. OKAY RIGHT WELL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I AM CONFIDENT THIS WILL BE OUR LAST CONVERSATION AND I KNOW THAT I THINK THERE'S SOME PLANS COMING FROM MERCURY SOON HAVING SOME REPORTS COMING FROM THE STATE SOON ON ON DIFFERENT ITEMS SO LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FOLLOW CONVERSATIONS IS YOU ALL YOU KNOW KIND OF.

A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS IT GOT REALLY BAD I AM REPRESENTING CENTER LEFT ME ADVOCATES SERVICES FROM FRESNO. AND I COME WITH SOME REPRESENTATIVES WITH THE CBO SAID THE AREA WERE PART OF THE- COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE OF FRESNO COUNTY. LIVING IN CENTRAL VALLEY WE KNOW MANY OF OUR RESIDENTS FIT INTO MULTIPLE HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF US A CBO THAT RECEIVE THE STATEWIDE CONTRACTS. DO NOT WORK IN THE REGION SO THEY DO NOT KNOW THE OUR POPULATIONS AND AS AN EXAMPLE ARE A CBO HAS FOCUSED ITS EFFORTS ALMOST. EARLY ON THE LATINO POPULATION BUT LEAVING OUT OTHER PUBLISHERS SUCH AS NATIVE AMERICANS LGBT Q. AT THE EIGHTY A COMMUNITY OF. RURAL POPULATIONS ETCETERA SO WHAT WE ASK IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE CAM COMMITTEE HOLD CONTRACTORS ACCOUNTABLE TO REACH OUT TO ALL HARD TO COME POPULATIONS. AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER UNDER ACCOUNT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO MY NAME IS GABRIELLE RIVAS AND I'M FROM FRESNO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION. PROCESS CHANGES COUPLED WITH A LIMITED BUDGET FEAR AND SUED BY THE POSSIBILITY OF US CITIZENSHIP QUESTION AND NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR CENSUS WORKERS AMONG OTHERS WILL EXACERBATE THE UNDERCOUNT NERIO SUCH AS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WHEN THE STATE'S REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS BEGIN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD IN PROPOSING THE MOST EFFECTIVE OUTREACH MODEL. AS TRUST ISN'T TRUSTED MESSENGERS WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE HOWEVER OUR REGIONAL A CBO HAS NOT BEEN TRANSPARENT AND SHOWING THEIR ORIGINAL PROPOSAL. FOR STRATEGIC PLAN IN ORDER TO VIEW THEIR PROPOSAL ORGANIZATIONS WERE TOLD TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY CREATES BARRIERS FOR TRUSTED MESSENGERS AS THEY DEVELOP OUT REACHED STRATEGIES WITHOUT VISIBILITY IT IT IS HARD TO PLAN AND CONTINUE OUT REACH. OUR RESIDENTS AND GROUPS WORKING ON CENSUS DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT IS OUTLINED ON STATEWIDE PLANS IN ORDER TO AVOID DUPLICATION AND COMPLEMENT WHAT IT'S COME. ALTHOUGH SPECIFIC STATEWIDE CONTRACTS WERE LATER DEVELOPED TO CATER TO HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAS YET TO SEE THESE FUNDS. THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD NOT AFFORD AN UNDERCOUNT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M NAZARIAN JOHNSON I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF FRESNO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AND SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AND FRESNO COUNTY. OTHER TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS A NEW METHODS WILL CREATE A DISADVANTAGE FOR OUR LOW INCOME IMMIGRANT AND RURAL RESIDENTS MANY LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER AND WANT TO CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE CENSUS ART REACH BUT WITH LIMITED FUNDING CAPACITY AND TRANSPARENCY PLUS LACK OF STATEWIDE SUPPORT WE STRUGGLE TO CONTINUE AT THE SAME CALIBER. AND THESE ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATIONS THAT I'M SPEAKING OF ARE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WE'VE BEEN HEARING IS SO NECESSARY FOR THIS ACCOUNT TO BE COMPLETE. IT WILL TAKE A VERY DELIBERATE AND PERSONAL TOUCH TO CONNECT WITH OUR HER TO COUNT POPULATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE ARE REQUESTING FUNDS TO REACH THESE POPULATIONS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR LOCAL A CBO'S PLANS. ARE THE CENTRAL VALLEY CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER UNDER COUNT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M ERIK VAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY URBAN INSTITUTE. THE LEGACY OF UNDER COUNTING AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE SINCE THE STATE'S BACK TO THE CENSUS COUNT IN SEVENTEEN NINETY. DURING THE WRITING OF THE US CONSTITUTION IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN DELEGATES DEBATED OVER THE NUMBER OF SEATS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IN SEVENTEEN NINETY A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE NORTHERN INSIDE THE SEVEN OR STATES RESULTED IN A DECISION FOR IN FLAMES AFRICANS TO BE COUNTED AS THREE FIFTHS OF A PERSON. FOR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION AND TAXATION WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BLACK HOUSEHOLDS WITHIN OUR REGION FACING A POSSIBLE UNDER COUNT. AND LOSS IN FEDERAL RESOURCES WE HELD OUR FIRST REGIONAL MEETING WITH THE STATE LAST WEEK WITH A HUNDRED AND FORTY PEOPLE IN A ROOM AND NOT ONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS WAR OF AFRICAN DYSPHORIA. NOT ONE OF THE FIFTEEN PANELISTS WE HEARD FROM DISCUSSED A STRATEGY TO REACH BILL BLACK FAMILIES NOT ONE OF THE NINE STATE WHY CONTRACTORS PRISON. PRESENTED DISCUSSED A WAY TO ENGAGE BLACK FAMILIES IT'S ALARMING BECAUSE WE'RE ON A PATH TO REPEAT HISTORY FROM TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WERE HISTORICAL BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS WENT UNDER COUNT IT BY SIXTY SIX. PERCENT AND FRESNO COUNTY HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF IT'S HAPPENING TO US WHAT ELSE IS IT HAPPENING IN THE STATE. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE STATE WHY PUBLIC OUTREACH CONTRACTOR WHILE IT HAS BEEN IMPLIED THAT THE STATE Y. CONTRACTOR IS NOT EXPECTED TO INVEST IN LOCAL IN ETHNIC MEDIA OUTLETS. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE PLATFORMS THE BEST SUITED TO CONVEY A SENSE THIS MESSAGING RESIDENTS WITH. WHAT MUCH RATHER HEAR THAT THEY NEED TO COMPLETE A CENSUS FORM THROUGH THEIR LOCAL TV RADIO STATION OR NEWSPAPER RATHER THAN A STATE WIDE MEDIA CAMPAIGN PLEASE WRAP UP. MY FINAL MINUTES. THE NEEDS. THE NEED THERE NEEDS TO BE A STRONGER. EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR SINCE THIS IS NOT WEAPONIZED THE SILENCE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR UNDERSCORING AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS COULD HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES. BECAUSE AFRICAN AMEICAN CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY POVERTY AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO ALLEVIATE THE IMPACT OF POVERTY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANNA REMIND FOLKS THAT. ARE WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOR TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE ACCEPTED INTO AUGUST THIRTIETH DETAILS ARE ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE WEB PAGES FOR THE TO SLOW THE- ASSEMBLY AND SENATE SO I COMMITTEES THERE'S ALSO INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM. OF THE HEARING AGENDA IS THAT I THINK ARE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN SUBMIT. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH I WANT TO THANK MY CULTURES DOCTOR PAN.
