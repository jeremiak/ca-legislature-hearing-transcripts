OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS. SO WE HAVE A SIMILAR WIENER IS HERE A SAUCE THERE'S CENTER WHERE I COULD MISS UNDER WIENER. AND WE HAVE. WE'RE NEED A MEMBERS. WE ARE WAY TO LISA GOOD MORNING WELCOME TO ELECTIONS COMMITTEE WE ARE GOING TO START AS A SUB COMMITTEE AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A SENATOR UMBERG'S BILL SIR NUMBER PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU CENTER LEYVA. BEFORE THE DAY IS SB SIX NINE SIX IT'S UP PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT VOTERS FROM BEING MISLED PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTY DESIGNATION AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IN CALIFORNIA TODAY THE SECOND LARGEST GROUP VOTERS ARE INDIVIDUALS REGISTERED AS NO PARTY PREFERENCE THIS GROUP IS MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS INDEPENDENT VOTERS. THIS GROUP IS TWENTY EIGHT POINT 6% OF CALIFORNIA VOTING ELECTED IS THE FASTEST GROWING. ELECTED OF ANY OF THE MAJOR CATEGORIES BACK TO MY OWN COUNTY AS WELL AS IN THE STATE. DECLINED WELL IN THE STATE CLIMB THE STATE VOTERS OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE VOTERS ARE NUMBER TWO AND FOR EXAMPLE ORANGE COUNTY THEIR THEIR QUICKLY RISING TO NUMBER TWO. IN ORDER TO REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE VOTERS WHO WISH TO REGISTER WITHOUT ANY PARTY PREFERENCE AND STAY INDEPENDENT. SB SIX NINE SIX WILL PROHIBIT THE NAME OF A POLITICAL PARTY FROM INCLUDING THE WORD INDEPENDENT DECLINE TO STATE OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR ANY VARIATION OF THOSE WORDS. UNDER EXISTING LAWS PROHIBITED FOR THE NAME OF A NEW PARTY TO BE SIMILAR TO THE NAME OF EXISTING PARTY. SO AS TO AVOID MISLEAD VOTERS MEANING DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS LIBERTARIANS ALL HAVE PROTECTIONS ON THEIR NAME UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROTECTION DOES NOT EXTENDED AND VOTERS CURRENTLY IS A WYOMING BANDS WORD INDEPENDENT AND OF ANY NEW POLITICAL PARTY JUST TO AVOID THE- KIND OF CONFUSION THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE. THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY HAS OVER A HALF MILLION REGISTERED VOTERS. ALL OF THE OTHER CALIFORNIA MINOR PARTIES COMBINED. THE CHAIR OF THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MARK SEIDENBERG KNOWLEDGE THAT VOTERS ARE BEING CONFUSED BY SAYING A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY FILL OUT A FORM MR SEIDENBERG WENT ON TO SAY THAT ONE REASON THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE ITS NAME IS THAT THE PARTY WOULD BE FORCED TO GET NEW VOTERS AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE. AND IT WOULD HAVE TO GET NEW WORDS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE- VOTERS WHO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE AMERICAN PAN PARTY IS NOT. REALLY A PARTY OF INDEPENDENCE WOULD LEAVE THAT PARTY IN RE REGISTER PERHAPS IS NO PARTY PREFERENCE. OUT WITH ME HERE IS MISTER MITCHELL. AS WITNESS AND WITH THAT MADAM CHAIRMAN TURN OVER TO MISTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU YOUR WITNESS AND SUPPORT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOW MUCH WITH POLITICAL DATA. AND I'D LIKE TO THINK THE SENATOR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME AND ATTENTION THIS BILL THERE'S ALREADY A- A GREAT WRITTEN ANALYSIS AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE. STAFF AND MEMBERS UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE VERY WELL. I'LL JUST ADD A COUPLE POINTS WITH HALF A MILLION REGISTRANTS WE'RE TALKING ONE IN FORTY CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THE THAT WE BELIEVE THEY ARE IN MISTAKENLY. AND THIS USED TO BE BASED ON ANECDOTES AND NOW IT'S BASED ON REAL DATA SO WE HAVE BOTH THE LA TIMES POLL. SAMPLING WE DONE WITH CAPITAL WEEKLY IN A LOT OF DATA TO SHOW THAT WHEN ASKED BETWEEN 324% OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENT VOTERS. CAN EVEN IDENTIFY THE POLITICAL PARTY. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THIS IS ROOTED IN KIND OF IGNORANCE OR PEOPLE JUST NOT UNDERSTANDING OR THEY SHOULD KNOW BETTER BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE'VE FOUND. VERY PROMINENT PEOPLE REGISTERED WITH AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY THE- THE FATHER OF A STATE SENATOR. THE WIFE OF AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION A SENIOR MEMBER OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE ADMINISTRATION. AND THEN EVEN WITH THIS NEW REDISTRICTING COMMISSION. WE'VE HAD. TWENTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS AND A NUMBER OF THEM OF PUT THAT THEY ARE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. AND WE HAVE FOUND JUST IN OUR FIRST LOOK AT MATCHING THESE VOTERS THAT THEIR SEVENTY FIVE OF THEM. THAT SAID THAT THEY WERE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT ON THE FORM THINKING THEY'RE INDEPENDENT THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. THERE REALLY REGISTERED NO PARTY PREFERENCE. ANOTHER TWELVE SEVEN WERE. PUTTING NO PARTY PREFERENCES THEY'RE READY. TO FORM AND THEY ARE INCORRECTLY REGISTERED AS AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. SO THERE'S A BIG CONFUSION AND I HOPE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ALLEVIATE THAT THANK YOU. VERY GOOD THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING. PARKS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GIVE ME MARK WHEN WE HAVE IT SECRETARY STATE ALEX PADILLA IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THIRTY ONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. COME ON UP SIR YOU MAY SIT AT THE TABLE. IT RIGHT THERE. PUBLIC I'LL MOVE OVER TO. ALL RIGHT TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. HOW MANY DID THE OTHER PEOPLE GET I HE WAS LESS THAN TWO MINUTES OKAY THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME. YEAH. OKAY YOU CAN ALWAYS COME IN UNDER WE LOVE THAT OKAY PLEASE PROCEED SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD MORNING EXCUSE ME MY NAME IS MARK SEIDENBERG I'M VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY CALIFORNIA. AND THE STATE WITH THEM MR ON BURKE MADE ABOUT BY STATE WAS OUT OF CONTEXT SO I WANT TO START OFF WITH THAT. OKAY FIRST OF ALL THE AMERICAN INTO THE PARTY HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE JULY EIGHTH NINETEEN. SIXTY SEVEN. WE'VE BEEN QUALIFIED POLITICAL PARTY SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE ARE CANDIDATES OF WALLACE WHEN THEY CAME IN FIRST A THIRD. IN SOME COUNTIES WE HAD ACCESS 220% OF VOTERS VOTED FOR A PARTY. SAM YORTY BEFORE MERYL LOS ANGELES VOTER FOR WELL WALL SOON ONE MAY NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT SO WE HAD STRONG SUPPORT. OUR PARTY IS NOT ABOUT TO CHANGE ITS NAME SO. ONE ISSUE IS THAT THEY SAY THAT THE WE HAVE TO HAVE. A CONVENTION TO CHANGE OUR NAME STATE LAW PROHIBITS PRECLUDES US FROM HAVING A CONVENTION UNTIL AFTER THE DIRECT PRIMARY. AND WE HAVE TELL CONVENTION IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY INTERSTATE CHAIRMAN HAS TO CALL CONVENTION AND- HI SECURE TERM IS CURRENTLY IN THE HOSPITAL. OUTSIDE THE COUNTY SO COULD NOT WE COULD EVEN CALL CONVENTION. SO THIS IS STILL A RUSE. ANYWAY BOTTOM LINE IS OUR PARTY IS NOT ABOUT CHANGE ITS NAME AND I KNOW SURRENDER MY TIME TO THE NEXT BAKER. THANK YOU SIR NEXT WITNESS IN SUPPORT RICHARD WINGER BALLOT ACCESS NEWS I HAVE FOUR POINTS. THE FIRST IS GIVEN THE TIMING IN THIS BILL IT VIOLATES DUE PROCESS THE SECOND POINT IS THE LAW THE BILL IS VAGUE. IT DOESN'T CLEARLY SPECIFY WHICH WORDS ARE PROHIBITED. THE THIRD IS. THERE ARE MANY. OKAY I'VE I'VE ASKED FOR A THE SERGEANT AT ARMS TO PUT A PIECE OF PAPER IN FRONT OF YOU. THIS SHOWS THAT FORTY SEVEN OF THE FIFTY STATES AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. IT HAD A PARTY OF QUALIFIED PARTY WITH THE WORD EITHER INDEPENDENT OR INDEPENDENCE. SOME GROUPS WANT CALIFORNIA TO SECEDE FROM THE UNITED STATES. THIS BILL I ASSUME IT BANS THE WORD INDEPENDENCE ENOUGH I'M WRONG I HOPE THE AUTHOR WILL CORRECT ME. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR SUCH A PARTY O DESCRIBE ITS MISSION IF THE WORD INDEPENDENCE. IS NOT PERMITTED. AND THE FOURTH IS THIS BILL VIOLATES. THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF ALMOST IDENTICAL LAW WAS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN TENNESSEE I WILL GIVE YOU THE SITES IF YOU WANT BUT THE TIME IS TICKING AND THERE ARE FAR BETTER WAYS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IT'S MUCH KINDER TO MAKE THINGS LIKE THIS VOLUNTARY TWELVE STATES LET PARTY'S CHANGE THEIR NAME. EVEN THE TWO MAJOR PARTIES HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THAT MINNESOTA THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHANGED ITS NAME TO DEMOCRATIC FARMER LABOR. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR CHANGED ITS NAME TO THE INDEPENDENT REPUBLICAN PARTY SALAS SWITCHED BACK. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER. WE SHOULD LET ANY PARTY CHANGED ITS NAME JUST AS OREGON DOES DOES THE SO WHY DOES. IF YOU DON'T FORCE THEM TO CHANGE THEIR NAME THEY MIGHT. FREE LEE COME UP WITH A NAME THEY LIKE. AND FINALLY IT'S SO SIMPLE TO JUST HAVE A CHOICE ON THE VOTER REGISTRATION CARD THAT SAYS I AM AN INDEPENDENT VOTER. WHY THIS IS NEVER BEEN DONE I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THANK YOU SIR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS UNDER STERN. OKAY VERY GOOD WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU. CENTERS LEYVA AND STERN I DON'T THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT VOTERS ARE BEING MISLED BY THE TERM INDEPENDENT THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY I THINK IT IS A GOOD SUGGESTIN AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY VOLUNTARILY CHANGED ITS NAME TO SOMETHING ELSE THE THAT THEY MIGHT LIKE OTHER THAN NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR DECLINE THE STATE OR ANOTHER. TERM THAT CONTAINS THE WORD INDEPENDENT THIS IS A- A MEASURE THAT SIMPLY MAKE SURE THAT VOTERS AREN'T MISLED WHEN THE RED STRING AND IN THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY MISS REGISTER IS THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CAN'T VOTE IN CERTAIN PRIMARIES SO IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION WHICH IS COMING UP AND TWENTY. TWENTY IF YOUR REGISTERS AMERICAN INDEPENDENT YOU CAN'T VOTE IN THE AT AND CERTAIN PRIMARIES AND SO A NUMBER OF VOTERS ARE MISLED THE ATTEMPT TO VOTE THAT CAN'T DO SO THE SIMS ASSEMBLY ACTS TO RECTIFY THAT ISSUE VIRGIN AYE VOTE. THANK NUMBER BEFORE WE TAKE THE VOTE LET'S CALL THE ROLL. NUMBER NUMBER HERE NIELSEN HERTZBERG. A ONE YEAR LABOR HERE STERN STERN HERE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SANDOR STERN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MOMENTS HE CONQUERED IN NUMBER. HI NUMBER I NIELSEN. NIELSEN. I HEARD ABOUT. IT IN THE THIS IS ON THE AMERICAN DENTAL PARKING. SHE'S JUST CALL. NIELSEN NIELSEN NO NIELSEN NO HERTZBERG LEYVA LEYVA AYE STERN STERN NINE. ALL RIGHT. WEST MATTER IS. SB TWO SIX EIGHT BY SENATOR WIENER. SIR WIENER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US IN THIS BILL TO YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE AFTER HEARING TODAY COLLEAGUES SB TWO SIXTY A IS LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ARE RECEIVING ACCURATE INFORMATION. IT WHEN THEY'RE VOTING FOR BONDS ARE PARCEL TAXES THAT THEY'RE NOT BEING MISLED AND DIE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CITIES COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO CRAFTS SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT QUESTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY COMPREHENSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE. PAST AND THAT SORT OF ONE UNDER THE RADAR FRANKLY TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION. DIE REQUIRED THAT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT QUESTION FOR PARCEL TAXES IN BONDS. THE REQUIRED A VOTERS BE INFORMED ABOUT QUOTE UNQUOTE WHAT THEY WILL HAVE TO PACK. AT ON THE SURFACE THAT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD AND I VOTED FOR THE ONE IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BUT THERE WERE. SIGNIFICANT UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES OF THIS CHANGE BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS SO SIMPLE. IS NOT. I AM THERE TO SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FIRST. IF YOU ARE TRYING TO PASS A TIERED PARCEL TAX. WHERE SENIORS GOT AN EXEMPTION WERE OUTSIDE PAYS LESS. WORK COMMERCIAL PAYS MORE THAN RESIDENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE. IT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION INTO SEVENTY FIVE WORDS.AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT UNDER THE STATE OF THE LAW RIGHT NOW. TIERED PARCELTAXES PROGRESSIVE PARCEL TAXES ARE BANNED EFFECTIVELY. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT FIT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THAT MEANS ALL PARCEL TAXES WILL HAVE TO BE A ONE FLAT RATE REGRESSIVE EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME PARCEL TAX THAT IS NOT FAIR IT'S NOT GOOD POLICY IN ADDITION FOR BONDS ALL RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE TIME THE VOTERSVOTE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TERMS OF THE BOND ISSUE ARE GOING TO BE WHAT THE INTEREST RATE IS GOING TO BE. ARE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY AND SO WE'RE FORCING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SPECULATE. AND GIVE AN ESTIMATE OR RANGE WHICH MAY BE INACCURATE AND MISLEADING PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE PAYING. ON THE BOND. SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IT INTO SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT ONLY A BROAD COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LABOR AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROUPS BEHIND THIS MEASURE. IS NOT TO REPEAL BUT TO MOVE THIS INFORMATION INTO THE VOTER GUIDE. AND TO REQUIRE. FOR THE FIRST TIME A PARENTHETICAL IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORK QUESTION THAT SAYS SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION WE WORKED OUT THAT LANGUAGE IN ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS. IT SAYS THE WORD TAX IT SAYS THAT THERE WERE YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR TAX RATE INFORMATION. GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE AND WE THINK THAT THE STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE IN TREND HAVING TRANSPARENCY NOT MISLEADING VOTERS NOT BANNING PROGRESSIVE TIERED PARCEL TAXES. AND HAVING INFORMATION THAT THE VOTERS. NEED. WE DO HAVE TODAY SOMEONE WOULD PLEASE. ALL THAT UP BRADY. AN EXAMPLE OF THE TO YOUR PARCEL TAX THAT IS NO LONGER LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS IS COMES FROM ACTUAL PARCEL TAXES IN EXISTENCE. DIFFERENT TYPES OF LAND PAY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS. I'M THE WHERE IT GRAY'S AL IS A SEVENTY FIVE WORDS. SO IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE YOU JUST CAN'T FIT IT IN THERE AND WHO ON EARTH WOULD WANT TO VOTER. TO HAVE A BALLOT QUESTION LIKE THAT ANYWAY. I BUT REGARDLESS YOU CAN'T DO IT AND SO THIS HAS A VERY REAL WORLD IMPACT ON OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. I WITH ME TODAY TESTIFYING OR REBEKAH. PURELY FROM THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING AND JEFF NEAL FROM COALITION FOR US IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION PRODUCT WITH SCHOOL HOUSING REPRESENTING SCHOOL DISTRICT SOME FACILITIES ISSUES IN SUPPORT LOCAL BONDS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE TO REPAIR CONSTRUCT BUILD UP GRADE SCHOOL FACILITIES. IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE TAX IMPACTS CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY TO OUR COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO MEAN TRUST AS THE SENATOR DESCRIBED RECENT CHANGES TO THE ELECTIONS CODE ARE MAKING IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS. ESPECIALLY LOW WELL DISTRICTS TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS TO HOUSE ALL STUDENTS I'M AND IT IS PREVENTING SCHOOLS FROM BEING ABLE TO FORWARD WITH PLACING BONDS ON THEIR LOCAL BALLOTS. OUT AS THE SENATOR DESCRIBED FOR BONDS THE RATES DO CHANGE AND ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE LOOKED AT. IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE IT WAS NINETEEN DOLLARS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ASSESSED VALUATION THE NEXT YEAR THAT I'M OUT WHEN UP TO SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ASSESSED VALUATION WHEN THE GREAT RECESSION HIT. THE VALUES TANK YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG SPREAD. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR LOCAL BONDS WE DON'T HAVE THE SPACE ON THE SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT LABEL TO MAKE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF UP TO VOTERS AND THE RESULT IS VOTER CONFUSION. POLLING DOES SHOW THAT SUPPORT THOSE BACK UP FOR THESE MEASURES ONCE VOTERS GET A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR THEM IN THEIR PERSONAL SITUATION WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO DO THAT ON THE BALLOT LABEL. WE DO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION ON THE TAX RATE STATEMENT IN THE VOTER GUIDE AND I SPEAK TO SIXTY EIGHT IN HAPPENS BUT IT MISSION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL I'M DOCTOR SUCH AS WHY THE RATES MAY CHANGE. FOR THESE REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT SB TWO SIX GAVE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AND HOPES. VOTERS REALLY UNDERSTAND IMPACTS OF MEASURES THANK YOU. MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS JEFF KNEW WHAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION A CAT. WE SUPPORT SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT FOR ALL THE REASONS STATED TO CORRECT THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE RECENT CHANGES. IN ADDITION TO NEW TO YOUR GREAT TAXES. I ALSO WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT EXISTING TIERED RATE TAXES THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY VOTED FOR. WITH THE OVERWHELMING NUMBERS THAT WE REQUIRE FOR LOCAL TAXES I CANNOT BE RENEWED BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE THESE MULTIPLE TIERS PERHAPS THEY EXEMPT VETERANS ARE THEY EXEMPTS. LOW INCOME SENIORS OR THEY- UNIMPROVED AGRICULTURAL LAND IN DIFFERENT RATE THAN IMPROVED LAND. A AND ALSO LOCAL BONDS THAT ARE SECURED BY A TWO YEAR BREAK TAXES THESE ARE THE BONDS THAT WE USED TO BUILD FIRE STATIONS. OF FLOOD CONTROL PROJECTS. THE COUNTY CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AS WELL AS SCHOOLS I USE THESE BONDS ALL. IMPORTANT INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE WE PROVIDE AND SO THE SOLUTION AS SENATOR WIENER INDICATE IS NOT TO ROLL BACK THE REQUIREMENT BUT I'M BACK TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO VOTERS AND TO PROVIDE IT YEAH WITH LANGUAGE THAT THEY ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND. INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT REQUIREMENT WHICH WHICH AS THAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID VOTERS POLINA SHOWN VOTERS FIND CONFUSING THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. SO WE APPRECIATE CENTER. WINNER BRING IN THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD AND JUROR I'VE OF. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BUT YOU'RE MEMBERS DON'T GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICT ASSOCIATION ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KAREN L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G ON BEHALF OF&lt;/c&gt; MARYLAND AND BREED IN THE CITY AND COUNTY TERMS IS GONE SUPPORT. MORNING MR CARE MEMBERS JEAN HEARST HERE TODAY WE HAVE.

THE MORNING SALINA PRIOR CALIFORNIA HAWAII STATE CONFERENCE OF INDEFINITELY SEEKING SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CRISTINA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND STRONG SUPPORT. THIS IS A SPORT OPPOSITION. REMEMBER OLD LOW OBERNOLTE. SENATOR WIENER ONCE YOU CAN OVER ONE OF THEIR MIND. YEAH THERE ARE YOU GOING TO HEAR YEAH. IF YOU LIKE THEN WIENER WITH IT YOU WANT TO JUST COME SO THAT THE END OF THE DIET ALL RIGHT. OKAY BUT WE ARE WORKED OUT I'M SORRY. MY PHONE. YOU TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE UNUSUAL FOR ME TO BE TESTIFYINGIN OPPOSITION HERE BUT THIS IS AN ISSUE I'M VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. THE SECTION OF THE STATE CODE THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING IN FIVE YEARS IN FACT. BOTH OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT THIS THE AUTHOR REFERENCE WERE MY BILLS SO HE IS SEEKING TO EXEMPT. THESE TYPES OF BOND ISSUANCES FROM THE GARMENTS THAT WE CREATED COLLECTIVELY IN THE LEGISLATURE. FOUR YEARS AGO. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS NOT THAT THERE AREN'T PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE SOLVED WITH THE LANGUAGE FOR THESE BONDS. ARE ONE AB ONE NINETY FIVE PASSED TWO YEARS AGO IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEAR. THAT SOME SITUATIONS HAD NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY THOUGHT OUT FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WHEN. A TEAR TAXES IMPOSED WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WHEN THE INTEREST RATE OR THE DURATION OF A BOND IS NOT KNOWN. WHEN THE ISSUE WAS PLACED ON THE BALLOT. HOWEVER COLLEAGUES FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS I HAVE AUTHORED LEGISLATION EACH YEAR TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THOSE PROBLEMS AND WHAT IS BECOME ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. IS THAT THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL ARE NOT INTERESTED. IN MERELY FIXING THE PROBLEM AND CONDENSING THE LANGUAGE ON THE BALLOT STATEMENT WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO DO. IS TO AVOID HAVING TO TELL THE VOTERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE. AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF THAT. I HAVE HERE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THEY'VE BEEN DRAFTED BY LEDGE COUNCIL WHAT THEY DO IS THEY SAY THEY COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE SENATOR. THEY SAY LET'S MOVE ALL OF THE LANGUAGE ABOUT THE RATE INFORMATION ON TO. THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE WHERE THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. TO LISTED AND INSTEAD LET'S JUST SAY THISLET'S SAY. THIS MEASURE INCREASES PROPERTY TAXES. SEE VOTER GUIDE. DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE ALL IT DOES IS MAKE IT CLEAR. THAT VOTING ON THIS MEASURE WILL INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES IF INDEED THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS NOT CONFUSING. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND I THINK IT ENCOMPASSES THE PURPOSES OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR HOWEVER WE OFFER THESE AMENDMENTS IN. THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AND THEY WERE SUMMARILY REJECTED BY THE BILL'S SPONSOR. I THINK THAT THAT PROVES WHAT THE ACTUAL INTENT IS. UP. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO SAY HERE IS THAT THIS MEASURE. IS A COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IF THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL BELIEVE VOTERS ARE CONFUSED. THEN IT WE SHOULD HAVE LOTS OF THESE BOND MEASURES THAT ARE BEING PLACED ON THE BALLOT AND FAILING. AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE I LOOKED AT ALL OF THE BOND MEASURES STATEWIDE THAT WERE PROPOSED IN THE LAST TWO YEAR ELECTION CYCLE. AND YOU KNOW THE PASSAGE RATE WAS ALL OF THEM COMPLIED WITH AB ONE NINETY FIVE. THE PASSAGE RATE WAS OVER 82% SO IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT VOTERS ARE NOT CONFUSED BY THESE EXTINCT EXISTING LANGUAGE. SO OUR I HAVE GIVEN THE SERGEANT ARMS A LITTLE HAND OUT TO PASS OUT TO YOU. THIS BILL WAS A LAST MINUTE GOT AMEND A HOWEVER IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF SINCE THE BILL HAS BEEN IN PRINT. WE HAVE HAD EDITORIAL BOARDS OF NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE HE AND ON THIS BILL. AND THE FEEDBACK HAS NOT BEEN KIND. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FROM ALL DIFFERENT POLITICAL STRIPES BIG. OUTLETS LIKE LOS ANGELES TIMES SERVICES WE CANNOT CHRONICLE SAN DIEGO UNION TRIBUNE. THE US SACRAMENTO BEE AND THEY'RE USING WORDS LIKE. SNEAKY DISHONEST DESPICABLE. A AND ALSO LIKE TO CALL ATTENTION TO MY FAVORITE PART OF THE BILL WHICH I HAVE NOT A LOT OF ATTENTION ACTUALLY THERE'S ONLY ONE OF THE EDITORIALS THERE THE MENTIONS IT BUT IT'S ANOTHER CHANGE THAT THE BILL WOULD BEG TO THE LANGUAGE OF AB ONE NINETY FIVE SAYS THIS FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS CHAPTER SHALL NOT AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF EITHER OF THE FOLLOWING A BOND ISSUE FELLING THE SALE AND DELIVERY OF A BONDS OR A TAX FOLLOWING ITS INITIAL IMPOSITION SO BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE THE RULES THERE STILL BE RIPPLES. BUT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE ANYONE WITH A MEASURE ON THE FAT FREE PASS IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE RULES THE ACTION THAT THEY TOOK IS STILL VALID AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG SO I WOULD ASK YOU COLLEAGUES IF YOU WOULD VOTE NO ON THIS OR AT THE VERY LEAST I THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE A TO YOUR BILL I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A LAST MINUTE GOT DEMAND THAT HERE WERE CONSIDERING THE DAY BEFORE THE END OF SESSION I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A REASON THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO SUCH AN- ON A TRIP. BALLOT LEAPING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CONSIDERING USE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COME MORNING DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE OPPOSED TO SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT TODAY MEMBERS IT'S WORTH NOTING WE WERE THE SPONSORS OF A SOME WOMEN OBERNOLTE IS TWO BILLS AT THAT HE REFERENCE DURING HIS TESTIMONY AND MEMBERS WHAT'S FRUSTRATING ABOUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS THAT WE TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING WE KNEW FULL WELL THAT LOCAL BONDS EVEN AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME COMPLYING WITH THE BALLOT LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT AB ONE NINETY FIVE WE- FOR THREE YEARS TO FIND LANGUAGE. TO EXEMPT THAT. AND TAKE CARE OF IT. ALSO AND I MEAN I PRESENTED LANGUAGE TO THE AUTHOR EVEN AS EARLY AS THE LAST MONTH TO THE AUTHOR STAFF. TO SAY. TO USE EVEN THE PHRASE MAY INCREASE YOUR PROPERTY TAXES BECAUSE THE AUTHOR IS RIGHT IN HIS PRESENTATION. WHEN BONDS ARE PASSED NOT EVERY YEAR PROPERTY TAXES GO UP AS A RESULT THE BONDS BONDS ARE SOLD IN CYCLES. AND AT DIFFERENT RATES AND ROUTINE SO IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT PROPERTY TAXES WILL GO UP YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF FUN SO WE DID BECAUSE THE MOMENT THAT SAY. IT MAY INCREASE YOUR PROPERTY TAXES TO THE AUTHOR STAFF AND THAT WAS SUMMARILY REJECTED AND NOT HEARD SO I MEAN WE'VE- SPENT YEARS AND YEARS TRYING TO BEND OVER BACKWARDS. TO ACCOMMODATE. THIS PROPOSAL THE CHANGES THAT NEEDED TO BE MADE AGAIN OUT OF A DESIRE TO GIVE VOTERS ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL BEFORE US GOES FAR BEYOND THE NECESSARY FIX. AND YOU KNOW WE WOULD ARGUE REPRESENTS ABROAD OVER A PRIOR OVERREACH. TRANSPARENCIES DIMINISHED AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT HELD TO ACCOUNT IF SPECIAL TAXES ARE REMOVED FROM THE BALLOT LABEL. VOTERS DESERVE BETTER. AND I JUST HEARD BACK TO. WHAT SOME WOMEN MENTIONED IN HIS TESTIMONY. IS THE BILL EVEN NOW. 82% OF ALL BOND TAXES PASSED IN LOCAL ELECTIONS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I'M WITH THEM FROM WESTERN ABOUT. IS IT NECESSARY THANKS. TO REDO IT. UNLIKE CUSHION I CAN DRAW IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SKIRT TRANSPARENT YET ASK FOR AN OF A. WELL I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL IT IS A MAJOR. RE WRITE IF YOU WILL OF LEGISLATION THAT DID PASS. AND AT THE LEAST SUCH CHANGES. OUGHT NOT BE OCCURRING AT THE LAST MINUTE. AND THERE OUGHT TO BE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITIZENS. OF CALIFORNIANS KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON SO OFTEN THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AROUND HERE. AND I THINK THAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL HERE AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE AFRAID. OF THE CITIZENS HAVING FULL. AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND I SPEAK IS THE LONG TIME CHAMPION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AROUND HERE. BUT THEY LIKE TO BE INSULATED WE'VE GOT ANOTHER BILL THAT JUST WAS UP YESTERDAY THAT ALLOWS THE LOCAL ENTITY TO IN FACT TECH IT'S VOTERS. TO CRAFT THE LINES OF THE VOTE. UNDER PROPOSITION. TO THE VANTAGE OF PASSING THAT PROPOSITION IN THEIR COMMUNITY IT'S RATHER TAXING. A COUPLE COUNTIES WHEN I REPRESENT AND WHEN I USED TO REPRESENT. THAT'S VOTER SHOPPING. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHERE WE OUGHT TO DO BUSINESS THIS BILL DESERVES A LOT MORE SCRUTINY A LOT MORE TIME. I CANNOT SUPPORT. THANK YOU NIELSEN HERTZBERG. WHY IS ALL THESE NEWSPAPERS JUST BRUTALIZE THIS DEAL THESE ARE DUMB PEOPLE WHAT WHAT'S I MEAN I GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THESE THINGS AND MORE PORTANTINO WHEN A PARTICULAR AGE IT IS ALL OF IN THE BOTTOM ONE ABOUT REDLANDS DAILY FACTS. MY FAVORITE NEWSPAPER. YEAH SO HEY I'M A REDLANDS GRADUATE GUYS COME ON THE PUBLISHED ALL MY STUFF. BUT FAILURE TO COMPLY WAS CHAPTERS FROM ANOTHER STILL INTERNET SO I APOLOGIZE IF I'M WRONG. THE VALIDITY OF ANY BOND ISSUES FOLLOWING THE SALE AND DELIVERY OF BONTA BASE LET'S LOCAL OFFICIALS OFF ENTIRELY OFF THE HOOK. SO IN A NUTSHELL BUT WHAT WHY ARE ALL THESE EDITORIAL BOARDS. DUMBER BOX RIGHT SO US CENTER THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL THAT THE VALIDITY LANGUAGE JUST MAD RED IS EXISTING LAW. WELL THAT'S NOT WE'RE NOT CHANGING THAT OKAY AND I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE IS IN A LOT OF TAX EXAGGERATION SWIRLING ABOUT THIS BILL I ALSO AND I DON'T HAVE THE EDITORIAL. LIST THAT. YOU HAVE I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT THAT'S FINE. THAT VOTE YOU KNOW AND I IT MIGHT MY COLLEAGUE HERE IS MY FRIEND WE WORKED ON BILLS TOGETHER A LOT OF RESPECT FROM HAS BEEN VERY. EFFECTIVELY READING FROM THESE UP AS HE DID IT VERY EFFECTIVELY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR. OF WHERE WE HAD YOU KNOW LITTLE NICE TO BE. ON THE BULK OF THOSE EDITORIALS ARE NOT FROM EDITORIAL BOARDS THEY ARE OUTSIDE GUESTS OPINIONS FROM PEOPLE LIKE. YOU KNOW DOWN WALTERS AND OTHERS WHO LIKE TO TAKE SHOTS. SOME OF THEM ARE YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE CONSOLIDATION AND MEDIA IT GETS PUBLISHED IN ONE. AND ALL THE SUDDEN IT'S PUBLISHED IN TEN AND IT LOOKS LIKE TEN DIFFERENT EDITORIAL WORK WHERE IT'S REALLY ONE. ON THE ONE THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER THAT A TWELVE WAS NEVER EDITORIALIZED ABOUT THIS. THE LA TIMES DID AND WITH ALL RESPECT TO THE LA TIMES OF A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THAT IT'S REAL BOARD. THAT EDITORIAL COMPLETELY IGNORED THE ACTUAL REASONS FOR THIS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR PARCEL TAXES ARE BANNED. UNDER THESE EXISTING LAWS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REFORM. AND THEN AT THE END OF THE LA TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD. ACTUALLY SAID WELL MAYBE YOU CAN DO WITH THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE A LITTLE BIT. AND THAT GETS INTO ANOTHER ISSUE I REALLY I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE OF MY- COLLEAGUE FROM THE ASSEMBLY WHO I THINK IS A LOT OF INTEGRITY. AND OUR JARVIS ALSO HAVING KNOWLEDGE. THAT THESE LAWS. ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC. AND MISTER OBERNOLTE HAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AND HERE AGAIN TODAY AND HOWARD JARVIS SAID. OKAY FINE. MOVE EVERYTHING INTO THE BALLOT HOW BOOK WHICH IS THE CORE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. WHAT WE WANTED THE PARENTHETICAL TO BE DIFFERENT WE WANT TO SAY. AN IN SAM LEAVE THE ADVOCATED FOR QUOTE THIS WILL RAISE. TAXES WHICH OF COURSE PAUL FOR THE YOU DON'T PAY PROPERTY TAXES. AND ALSO FALLS IF YOU HAVE A PRO A PARCEL TAX THAT YOU WERE SIMPLY EXTENDING AT THIS RATE IT'S NOT RAISE YOUR TAXES. AND SO NOW THEY'RE SAYING. THIS MAY RAISE TAXES. I. FIRST US IN IT AND IT WAS I THINK HE- TRIED TO STRIKE A BALANCE TO CHANGE IT TO. THE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION TO USE THE WORD TAX THE SAID THERE IS A TAX RATE AT ISSUE HERE. SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL SO NO ONE WILL BE BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN A TAX. AND I THINK IT WAS A GOOD BALANCE IN THE END. THIS YEAR THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE OF NOT REQUIRING ALL THIS INFORMATION AND SEVEN FIVE WORDS. THAT THAT WAS IN PLACE FOR A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S ONLY FOR A COUPLE YEARS. BY CHANGING SOME LONGSTANDING LAW WHICH IS GOING BACK MOST OF THE WAY TO THE WAY IT ALWAYS WAS IN CALIFORNIA. OTHER QUESTIONS.
