THE STATE PAYS- INTO THE

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:01.140
WE'RE ALSO NOT REUIRING THE

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.808
WITHHOLDING OF 4% WERE ACTUALLY

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:03.976

REDUCTION OF. FIVE POINT TWO

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.448
THREE PERCENT. AND IT APPEARS

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.984
THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE TAKING

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:15.021
A REDUCTION IN HOURS THOSE

00:09:15.087 --> 00:09:18.124
HOURS ARE BEING. SET ASIDE AND-

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.059
A DEFERRED PROGRAM TO LIKE GET

SICK LEAVE OR VACATION UNUSED

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:26.232
TIME SO I'M WONDERING. ABOUT

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.167
TWO THINGS ONE- IF WE'RE NOT

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:30.770
PAYING IN THE 4% THAT MEANS%

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:32.238
THAT THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR

00:09:32.305 --> 00:09:33.472
THE RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN IS

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:36.442
INCREASING BY A SUBSTANTIAL

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:38.210
NUMBER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE-

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.378

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:40.746
RATE OF RETURN FOR THE RETIREE

00:09:40.813 --> 00:09:43.015
MEDICAL PLAN. BUT IF IT'S THE

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.318
SAME AS CALPERS THAT WOULD BE

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.621
7% SO THAT'S- TEN TIMES THE

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:50.356
RATE. THAT THE GOVERNMENT- THE

00:09:50.423 --> 00:09:51.357

00:09:55.161 --> 00:09:59.665
EXPENSIVE. DEAD AND WERE.

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:00.866

I UNDERSTAND THAT THOSE

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.182
COMPONENTS RECORD THAT I MIGHT

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:16.682

UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND WE

THIS MIGHT BE IN FUTURE YEARS

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.358
IF THINGS CONTINUE TO BE A

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:14.627
LITTLE TIGHT. IT MIGHT BE AN

00:13:14.693 --> 00:13:15.961
OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE A REYES

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:16.695
WITHOUT GIVING REYES YOU CAN

THESE CYCLES- BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.611
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY

00:13:32.678 --> 00:13:34.146

OVER A SIX BILLION DOLLARS AND

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:37.483
NOW IT'S GONNA GROW CLOSE TO

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.484
NINETY BILLION THAT'S A LOT OF

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:41.720

WAS A GROUP THEY WERE GREETED

00:13:54.833 --> 00:13:55.901
BY THE BARGAINING UNITS AND WE

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:58.504
REDUCED OUR INPUT OF LIABILITY

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:03.976
BY 71% SO. 71% TIMES NINETY IS

00:14:04.043 --> 00:14:04.577
A GOOD SIXTY BILLION WITH THE

00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:05.945
TAKE OFF THE BALANCE SHEETS OF.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.881
THEY HAVE BEEN TO AT THAT TO

00:14:08.948 --> 00:14:11.684
BECAUSE THIS IS CERTAINLY A-

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.052
VERY HIGH ANNUAL COSTS THAT

00:14:13.118 --> 00:14:15.588
WILL BE BORN FOR. THANK YOU

PRESIDENT I ALSO TO- JUST

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.429
WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON MAYBE A

00:14:23.495 --> 00:14:24.763
LITTLE EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAD

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:25.497
WHEN I WAS A CASE SUPERVISORS

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.400
WELL. TO THE DIFFERING THOSE

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:30.970
OUT- SO A LOT OF THOSE

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.439
EMPLOYEES WILL GET STEP

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.574
INCREASES ALONG THE WAY. AND

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:37.476
THEY WILL ALSO. MAYBE IF YOUR

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:38.644
LONG COURSE THAT YOU BECOME A

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.846
SERGEANT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BANK

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:41.447
THAT UP AND WHEN YOU GO TO

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:43.115
RETIRE. ON YOUR TO HIGHER

00:14:43.182 --> 00:14:44.516
SALARY AND SO REALLY YOUR YOUR

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.085
CALL FOR YOU YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.219
NOT BASED AT THE TIME WHEN THEY

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.487
SET IT ASIDE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:51.757
BASED. AT THE TIME. WHEN HE

00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.059
RETIRES SO THAT'S A DOUBLE HIT

00:14:54.126 --> 00:14:55.594
TO THE BUDGET IN FUTURE YEARS

00:14:55.661 --> 00:14:56.829
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

00:14:56.895 --> 00:14:58.464
THAT- THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.366
TAKE AND IT. INTO CONSIDERATION

00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:02.635
AS WELL. BECAUSE YOUR REAL

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:03.802
REALLY GETTING A DOUBLE HIT

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:04.536
BECAUSE A LOT OF THOSE

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:06.038
EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO GET.

00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.172
THEY'RE GONNA GET CALLS ALONG

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.707
THE WAY AND ALSO GOING TO GET.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:10.009
MAYBE A STEP INCREASE IN SO
