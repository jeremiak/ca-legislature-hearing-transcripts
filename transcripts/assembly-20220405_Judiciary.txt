AND ONE IS FOR A ANOTHER MEMBER WHO WILL NOT BE WITH US TODAY. SO WE WILL BE I THINK THIS DOWN ONE BUT- VISIBLY COMMITTEE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. ALL RIGHT WE WILL WORK AS A SUB COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW AND MISTER BLUE OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER. I HAVE A PLACE 2% AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY ONE WHICH REQUIRES LEVYING OFFICERS SUCH AS SHERIFFS AND MARSHALS WHO SERVE PROCESS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTS FOR SERVICE BY FAX OR OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE REQUEST CONTAINS AN ORIGINAL WET SIGNATURE. AND WITHOUT SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW. OF A VALID COURT ORDER. I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR- CURRENTLY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IS TASKED WITH SERVING COURT DOCUMENTS INCLUDING RESTRAINING ORDERS AND THE FILE LITIGANT ELECTS TO HAVE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. SERVE THOSE COURT DOCUMENTS THE LITIGANT MUST COMPLETE A REQUEST FOR SERVICE FORM AND DELIVER THE FORM AND THE COURT DOCUMENTS TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM SERVED. AT PRESENT THESE REQUEST FOR SERVICE FORMS ARE CREATED BY EACH SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND THE FORMS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COUNTY. IN MOST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES THE REQUEST FOR SERVICE FORM MUST BE PHYSICALLY SIGNED BY THE APPLICANT USING A WET SIGNATURE. AND DELIVERED IN PERSON TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WITH THE DOCUMENTS TO BE SERVED AND IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS SAID THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS PRESENTS SOME OBSTACLES TO LOW INCOME AND RURAL THAT AGAINST. WHO DO NOT HAVE A MEANS OF OBTAINING A PRINTED COPY OF COURT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE FILED AND RECEIVED ELECTRONICALLY FROM THE COURT. NORWAY TO TRANSPORT PAPER DOCUMENTS TO A DISTANT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. ANOTHER CHALLENGE THAT LITIGANTS ARE FACING IN SOME COUNTIES IS THAT SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS HAVE ENGAGED IN A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW OF COURT ORDERS ALREADY REVIEWED AND SIGNED BY A JUDGE. IN THESE SITUATIONS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAKES ITS OWN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THEY THINK THE ORDER IS VALID. BEFORE THEY AGREE TO SERVE THE ORDER. THIS PUTS LITIGANTS IN THE AND REASONABLE POSITION OF HAVING TO GO BACK TO COURT AND ASK A JUDICIAL OFFICER TO RECONSIDER ORDERS THAT THEY ALREADY RULED ON. AND SENATE APPROVED TO SATISFY THE UNNECESSARY SCRUTINY OF A PROCESS SERVER. OF THESE CHALLENGES DELAY THE PROCESS AND INCREASE THE RISK OF HARM TO LITIGANTS. SO AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY ONE MODERNIZES AND STREAMLINES THE- CURRENT SYSTEM TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES BY REQUIRING. THE CREATION OF A UNIFORM STATEWIDE SHARE CONSTRUCTION FORM THAT WILL BE UGH ARE PREPARED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IT ALSO REQUIRES LEVYING OFFICERS TO ACCEPT ELECTRONICALLY SIGNED SHARE CONSTRUCTION FORMS AND TO ACCEPT DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS FOR SERVICE BY FAX OR ELECTRONIC MAIL AND TO ACCEPT ANY ORDER FOR SERVICE. AS LONG AS THE ORDER IS SIGNED BY A JUDGE INCLUDING BY ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE WITH A COURT ENDORSEMENT OR SEAL. THIS BILL IS PARTICULARLY CRUCIAL FOR ABUSE SURVIVORS WHO RELY HEAVILY ON THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FOR SERVICE OF COURT DOCUMENTS BECAUSE IN MANY CASES ESPECIALLY WHERE FIREARMS MAY BE INVOLVED SHARE SERVICE IS FAR SAFER FOR THE VICTIM. I AM PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY AMANDA CHANG Q. WITH THE LOS ANGELES CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE AND STEPHANIE PENROD WITH THE FAMILY VIOLENCE VIOLENCE LAWCENTER WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING REMOTELY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU MR WILL AND I DO HAVE A MANDATE CHEN Q. AND STEPHANIE PENROD. HAS LISTED BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. AMANDA JANE Q. ARE YOU WITH US. THANK YOU GO AHEAD PLEASE. AT THE- IN GEORGETOWN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLAN I AM THE GENTLEMAN YOUR FAMILY LAW ATTORNEY AT THE LOS ANGELES CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE AND WE SERVE LOW INCOME SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND I CURRENTLY RUN OUR STATE LIKE TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER PROJECT. THE PRACTICE OF THIS YEAR DEPARTMENT ENGAGING IN THIS GRATUITOUS. SUBSTANTIVE OF COURT ORDERS HAVE BEEN HOW FOR WELL OVER TEN YEARS TO AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF LITIGANTS. BUT THE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES ARE EVIDENT FROM THE STORIES OF THE SURVIVORS THAT WE CAN REACH. MY COLLEAGUE PAULA CALLING FROM LA FLAT ASSISTED A PREGNANT SURVIVOR IN SEEKING A RESTRAINING ORDER FOR HERSELF AND HER UNBORN CHILD. AFTER HISTORY OF ABUSE FROM A PARTNER AND THE SUSPICIOUS DEATH OF THE PARTY'S FIRST CHILD. HOWEVER THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO SERVE A RESTRAINING ORDER A ROHINGYA FLEE INSISTING THAT AN UNBORN CHILD WAS NOT A VALID PROTECTED PARTY. AND THAT THEY NEEDED A NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH. EVEN WITH. MY COLLEAGUES POLICY ADVOCATES SAY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WINNING ADAMANT AND THE ISSUE WOULD ONLY RESULT AFTER THE JUDGE HERSELF CALLED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT TO INSIST THAT HER ORDER WAS VALID. AND SHOULD BE FACT. THE REQUIRE OF PENSION SIX. THAT HANDLE AFTER. AFTER EFFECTS ON JULY. MICHAEL STEPHANIE PENROD WILL TEST ABOUT THE NORTH CARE. BUT WE HAVE THE STORIES AND SO CAL. YEAH THAT'S SEVENTIES YEAR OLD DISABLED SURVIVOR WHO WAS TOLD SHE MUST HANDLE WEBER HER RESTRAINING ORDER DOCUMENT. HE NEARBY SHARE DEPARTMENT OR IN A NEARBY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OVER A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILES AWAY WHICH IS ABOUT THREE HOURS EACH WAY. WE HAVE ANOTHER TV SURVIVOR WHO DROPPED HER RESTRAINING ORDER AFTER SHE WAS UNABLE TO TRAVEL IN PERSON. TO THE SHERIFF'S. DEPARTMENT TO REFLECT THEIR- THE LOADING SURVIVORS THE ONES SUFFER. FROM THESE PRACTICE BECAUSE BACK WHEN SUMS AND WE- THEY OFTEN HAVE NO OTHER ON. FOR OF. THE LAST LEVEL TRANSFER. OR CHILDCARE AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES THEY MAY HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS- CYCLE EMOTIONAL BARRIERS RELATED TO TRAUMA OR DISABILITY. AND THE EXAMPLE THAT WE SHARED TODAY ARE OF THE LITIGANTS ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE LEGAL ASSISTANCE IN NAVIGATING THESE BARRIERS. BUT MOSTLY AGAINST DO NOT HAVE AN ATTORNEY OR AN ADVOCATE AND SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE LITIGANTS ARE ATTEMPTING TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM. WITHOUT HELP AND SUPPORT. AB TWENTY SEVEN NINETY ONE HELP SECURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND OTHERS BY ENSURING THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT COULD NOT IMPOSE UNREASONABLE BARRIERS ON LITIGANTS ARE ASKING THEM TO SERVE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS. AND IT ALSO BRINGS THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT IN LINE WITH THE PROGRESS OF THE COURTS AND COUNTLESS OTHER SYSTEM TO ARE NOW USING REMOTE TECHNOLOGY TO ACCESS SERVICE THAT. EXHAUSTED ALL OF OPTIONS LOCAL TO TRY RESOLVE ISSUES WITH ARTS DEPARTMENT BUT YOU KNOW WITH. WHICH IS WHY WE SUPPORT THE BUDGET. TO ADDRESS THESE AND JEFF FIFTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDER OF THE.

W. BUSH. IN NINETEEN NINETY. ALTHOUGH THE LANDMARK POLICIES OF THE PAST HAVE MADE MAJOR STRIDES FOR THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY MANY ASPECTS OF THE STATE LAWS NEED TO BE UPDATED TO ADJUST TO MODERN TIMES. ESPECIALLY REGARDING MODERN TECHNOLOGY. CALIFORNIA IS AND HAS BEEN A NATIONWIDE LEADER AND ENABLING LANDMARK LEGISLATION FOCUSING ON THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. AB NINETEEN NINETY WILL CONTINUE THIS LEADERSHIP BY CREATING A WORK GROUP TO ADDRESS THE UPDATED UP. EXCUSE ME TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR UPDATING LAWS AND SERVICES TO AIM TO SUPPORT ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES. THIS LEGISLATION AIMS TO BRING PEOPLE REPRESENTING THE MANY FACES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS DISABILITIES TO THE TABLE FOR MUCH NEEDED CONVERSATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

THE DISABILITY MOVEMENT HAS GONE ON FOR NEARLY A CENTURY WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE EQUALITY AND EQUALITY FOR ALL PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. DISABLED PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ADVOCATE KNOWING THAT WE CARRY ON THE INCREDIBLE LEGACY OF DISABLED ADVOCATES AND LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY BUT SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. MANY OF THE LEADING DISABILITY ADVOCATES ARE FROM CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES FOUGHT AND WON BATTLES TO GET SECTION FIVE OH FOUR OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE THE INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT AND ULTIMATELY THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY.

AB NINETEEN NINETY WOULD FORM A WORK GROUP FOR STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY BUSINESS COMMUNITY LABOR EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE COMMUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER TO PUT FORWARD IDEAS ON WAYS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DEVELOP A CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.

CALIFORNIA LIKE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER HARRIS SAID HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY OF INDEPENDENT DISABILITY CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS THAT EITHER MEET OR EXCEED FEDERAL LAW SANDERS. SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN THE ADA WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY CALIFORNIA IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO PASSED AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH STRENGTHENS CALIFORNIA LA WHERE IT WAS WEAKER THAN THE FEDERAL ADA. AND RETAINED CALIFORNIA LAW WHERE IT WAS STRONGER THAN THE AVIARY. SOMETHING SIMILAR IN TWO THOUSAND AFTER THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WEAKEN THE ADA IN A SERIES OF CASES. TWO TWENTY TWO OR THE CURRENT K. POP THINK ACT TO ENSURE THAT THOSE HARMFUL FEDERAL COURT DECISION COULD NOT GOVERN CALIFORNIA JURISPRUDENCE ENACTED SECTION FIVE OH EIGHT AND NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT CALIFORNIA PASSED SB ONE OH FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND CHU TO CREATE A SIMILAR REQUIREMENT IN CALIFORNIA.

I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE ARE GOING TO MISS YOU AND- ROLE BUT ALSO YOU'RE A COMMITTEE STAFF. FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THIS BILL. FOR THE RECORD I ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT. AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE WILL HELP CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SAFEGUARD OPIOID MEDICATIONS. AND REDUCE THE ACT OF PILL. A POWERFUL ON RAMP TO THE NATION'S CURRENT OPIOID ADDICTION CRISIS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE A PHARMACIST TO PROVIDE SCHEDULED TO END TO END. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND A LOCKABLE CONTAINER. PRESCRIPTIONS SUCH AS MORPHINE OXYCODONE AND REDOLENT. HILFERDING WHICH IS THE ACT OF SNEAKING A SMALL NUMBER OF PILLS HOPING THAT IT WILL GO UNDETECTED IS THE LEADING SOURCE OF USED OPIOID ABUSE. THE OUTDATED CHILD RESISTANT PRESCRIPTION VIALS CURRENTLY IN USE HAVE NOT BEEN MODIFIED IN OVER FIFTY YEARS. WHEN THE FEDERAL POISON PREVENTION PACKAGING ACT WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THE GOAL THEN WAS TO PREVENT CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE FROM GAINING ACCESS TO ASPIRIN. TODAY THOSE SAME CHILD LOCKS ARE USED TO PROTECT MEDICATIONS THAT RANGE FROM COUGH MEDICINE TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT MEDICATIONS THAT ARE EIGHTY TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. REQUIRING LOCKING PRESCRIPTION VIALS FOR POWERFUL NARCOTICS IS A LOW COST WAY FOR CALIFORNIA TO MODERNIZE THE ANTIQUATED FEDERAL LAWS THAT ARE PARTIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THIS NATIONWIDE EPIDEMIC. THERE ARE TWO WITNESSES WHO WE HAVE ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE PADDY VARGAS REPRESENTING THE RECOVERY ADVOCACY PROJECT AND SHERRY DALY THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS.

MSJ WE HAVE NO MORE SUPPORT IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE A LISTED OPPOSITION LYNSEY COHORT IN. HERE IN THE ROOM. FOR PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS ONE OF THE GOING ON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE. AT WOULD YOU SHARE THE AUTHORS GOAL TO THIS ISSUE WITH THIS ISSUE TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC- AND WE ARE NOT AT ALL OPPOSED TO PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO VOLUNTARILY USE LOCKABLE PRESCRIPTION VIALS. ARE CONCERNS INSTEAD CENTER ON THE UNDUE BURDEN WE THINK THIS WILL PLACE ON PHARMACIES. AND I'M PATIENTS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICATION. A PATIENT MIGHT HAVE ANY NUMBER OF CONDITIONS AND THEN TO A PHARMACIST THAT MIGHT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO ACCESS THEIR MEDICATION IN A WALKABLE VILE- OR THEY MIGHT FORGET THEIR PASSCODE MISPLACE IT BE UNABLE TO RETRIEVE IT. AND NOT LEAVE THEM WITHOUT ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICATION. IN ADDITION TO THE ACCESS ISSUES- THIS BILL WILL PUT A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN ON PHARMACIES BY REQUIRING PHARMACIES DIFFERENTLY THE COST OF THE LOCKABLE VIALS AND SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FROM MANUFACTURERS. I AM CURRENT COST OF CURRENT CHILD SAFE M. VILES ARE PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR WHERE'S THE LOCKABLE VIALS CAN COST MORE THAN THE MEDICATION THEY CONTAIN. IN ADDITION TO THAT- PHARMACIES DON'T INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH MANUFACTURES WE CURRENTLY- INTERACT WITH WHOLESALERS FOR THE ACT ACQUISITION OF DRUGS SO TO M. EMPLOYMENT THIS WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ENTIRE NEW ACCOUNTING PROCESS JUST TO RECEIVE. AM REIMBURSEMENT AND THIS WILL HINDER PHARMACY WORKFLOW AND DISTRACT FROM PATIENT CARE. AND LAST THING I WANT TO RAISE THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY ENACTED A BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE. WHICH REQUIRES CHAIN PHARMACIES TO PROMINENTLY DISPLAY SAFE STORAGE PRODUCTS THAT THE PATIENTS IF THEY WISH TO USE THESE. THEY ARE ABLE TO DO SO- THIS WAS ONLY BEEN EFFECT FOR THREE YEARS I THINK IT IS PREMATURE TO IMPLEMENT A MANDATE AND WITHOUT FIRST EXAMINING THE FINANCING IF IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE. IN ADDRESSING PRESCRIPTION DRUG THEFT AND ABUSE. I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND I THINK WE CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE WOULD REMOVE OPPOSITION. IF THE BILL WAS MADE VOLUNTARY THE LOCKABLE VIALS AND IF THE BURDENSOME ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS ON PHARMACIES ARE REMOVED AND JUST WANT TO REITERATE. OUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WHAT THE AUTHOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT TODAY UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN OPPOSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE A- TO AB. TWO S&lt;c.cyan&gt; FIVE. SIGNUP ALL RIGHT&lt;/c&gt; OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB. TWENTY TWO SIXTY FIVE.

VEHICLE HISTORY REPORT PROVIDERS AGGREGATE DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES TO COMPILE REPORTS THAT PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT A VEHICLE SUCH AS PREVIOUS OWNERSHIP SERVICE HISTORY AND PRIOR COLLISION. SOMETIMES THESE REPORTS CONTAIN INCORRECT INFORMATION WHICH CAN QUICKLY DEVALUE OF VEHICLE AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR CAR OWNER TO SELL. REQUIRING THE INCLUSION OF CONTACT INFORMATION FOR EACH ITEM ON A VEHICLE HISTORY REPORT WILL MAKE ERRORS EASIER TO FIX FOR CONSUMERS AND WILL INCREASE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

THE MORNING OR. OKAY HI HI. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER I TO THANK OF ALL THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL- I AM SAID ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITIONS USED IN THE BILL THESE MOMENTS APPEAR IN MOCK UP FORM ON PAGES TEN AND ELEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS I THINK ALL OF US WOULD HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE IF YOU BUY ANYTHING ONLINE OF GETTING YOUR WHICH IT IN THE MAIL AND THEN BEING ASTOUNDED BY THE AMOUNT OF NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC THAT HAS COME UP WITH THAT WHICH IT. WITH THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BY GOING AFTER WHAT'S REALLY THE LOW HANGING FRUIT OF NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC MATERIAL WHICH IS THIS ADDED PACKAGING WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT NECESSARY- THERE ARE. ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET TODAY THAT WILL BE EITHER COMPOSTABLE OR RECYCLABLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME R. E. RETAILERS TO START USING WE HAVE PUT REASONABLE EXEMPTIONS AND LONGER TIME FRAMES IN THE BILL FOR MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO PACKAGE AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE AS SOMEONE WHO HAD AN ART GLASS COMPANY WHERE I WAS LITERALLY SHIPPING FRAGILE GLASS AROUND THE WORLD THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE THAT WORK EVEN FOR FRAGILE ITEMS. BUT IT TAKES A CALIFORNIA TO PUSH THE MARKET TO SET TO THAT THAT STANDARD SO THAT THE DEVELOPERS OF THIS TYPE OF MATERIAL SCALE IT UP GET IT OUT GET IT TO STAPLES GET INTO TARGET SO THAT EVEN THE SMALL GUY AT HOME CAN BY IT AS THEY VERY MUCH WANT TO AND LASTLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE- BRUNT OF ALL OF THIS NON RECYCLABLE PLASTIC IS BEING PAID FOR BY RATE PAYERS BECAUSE EVERYBODY IF YOU LIVE IN A MUNICIPALITY YOUR TRASH FEES ARE GOING UP BECAUSE THE LANDFILLS ARE FILLING UP WITH THIS MATERIAL IT'S GUMMING UP THE RECYCLE MACHINES BECAUSE IT GETS STUCK IN THOSE MACHINES. IT'S REALLY A PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL HAVING TO PAY FOR AND SO FAR AFFECTS SOME RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD ACTORS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY TAKES THIS SERIOUSLY- FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR MARINE LIFE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT WE ARE I DON'T I ALSO WANT TO SAY TO.

IS BANNED THAT WE DO WE DISAGREE IS NOT CRITICAL TO SHIPPING- THEY REALLY HUNDRED OF CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S TELEVISIONS LCD MONITORS- PRINTERS APPLIANCES X. THAT ARE USING EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE- WE DO. I DISAGREE THAT SHIPPING GLASS VERSUS SHIPPING. HI THE BREAKABLE OF TRONICS IN WHICH THE B. S. THE SHOCK- IMPACTS FROM SHIPPING FROM EAST ASIA INTO THE UNITED STATES- HAS VERY FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS AND SO THERE IS NO- EPS BAND ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD ON THESE DURABLE GOODS REPRESENTS ZERO POINT 5% OF OUR WASTE STREAM WE WHOLLY AGREE WITH IMPROVING THAT THE RECYCLING CALIFORNIA- THE SOURCE REDUCTION OF SUPERFLUOUS PACKAGING. THAT MANUFACTURES NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE- TO RECYCLE THIS AND IF WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS IN A VACUUM AB ONE THING WE ARE CURRENTLY NEGOTIATING A CIRCULAR FIRST IN THE NATION- BROADER THAT- RECYCLING BILL THAT COVERS ALL THE SAME PACKAGING THAT IS CURRENTLY BANNED UNDER THIS BILL. AND SO WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE AND INCONGRUENT WITH THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND IN FACT. WE THINK IT'S- COULD LEAD TO PERVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES IF YOU HAVE TO SHIP- LITERALLY MILLIONS OF TV'S OR OTHER BREAK BILLS BACK TO THEIR- ORIGIN WHETHER IT'S GREENHOUSE GAS SHIPPING IT BACK OR LANDFILLING MUCH MORE. UP LARGER BREAKABLE AND WORSE- IN MARBLE OUTCOMES THROUGH LANDFILLING THESE PRODUCTS THAT BREAK AND SO WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY TO FIND A- COMPROMISE THAT. I THINK FALLS INTO THE BROADER CIRCULAR ECONOMY DISCUSSIONS WHICH CALCHAMBER ITS MEMBERS ARE WHOLLY ENGAGED AT THIS TIME AND SO WITH THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPPORTUNITY COMMENTS THANKS. THANK YOU. THAT'S WITH WITH A MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TIM CHESTED WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL- I'VE GOT TO WANT TO.

A 75% RECYCLING REQUIREMENT BY TWENTY THIRTY TWO. SOURCE REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS ON PRODUCERS PRODUCER PAY FEES TO HELP INCREASE- THE COLLECTION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE STATE SO WE CAN PROCESS IT. THIS MATERIAL TO CONTAIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RECYCLED MATERIAL SO WE CAN CLOSE THAT LOOP- AND MAKE SURE THAT NO MUCH MORE MATERIAL.

MISTER JONES SAWYER THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE'LL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER EIGHT A. B. TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE. THAT. GOOD GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS THAT TODAY AMBER I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE THE BAND A BOX HOUSING ACT CALIFORNIANS WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD- HISTRIA INSTANTLY MARKED WITH A SCARLET LETTER THAT BLOCKED HIM FROM GETTING THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK AND REUNITING THEM WITH THEIR LOVED ONES THIS BILL WILL BAN THE BOX PREVENTING RENTERS FROM INCLUDING QUESTIONS REGARDING THE APPLICANT'S CRIMINAL HISTORY ON THE INITIAL BY REPEAT THE INITIAL ROUND UP APPLICATIONS WHILE SEEKING HOUSING. AT THE STANCE TODAY WE PUNISH THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED INCARCERATION FOR BEING HONEST ABOUT THE PAST WHEN TRYING TO SECURE HOUSING AT A TIME WHEN OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SPECIFIC TO FORMERLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS OF COLOR 61% REPORT DIFFICULTY FINDING HOUSING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF OTHERS MOST HOUSING APPLICATIONS HAVE FEES AND OFTEN- FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE ARE PAYING TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FIFTY DOLLARS EVEN A HUNDRED DOLLARS PER APPLICATION ONLY TO HAVE THEIR APPLICATION THROWN IN THE TRASH. BECAUSE OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD. IT WORSE FORMALLY INCARCERATED CALIFORNIANS FACE CRIME FREE HOUSING POLICIES THAT EMPOWER RENTERS TO EXCLUDE THE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVED POPULATION FROM NEIGHBORHOODS WITH ACCESS TO BETTER SCHOOLS AND OPPORTUNITIES. ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES TIMES ARTICLE SOME LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS OFFER TRAINING TO RENTERS ON HOW TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A FORMERLY INCARCERATED WITHOUT SUFFERING LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. I'M AUTHORED AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE TO GIVE THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED A PATH TO LIFE SUSTAINING HOUSING. THANKS TO THE WORK OF CAN OF THIS COMMITTEE THIS BILL BUILT ON THE ALREADY EXISTING REGULATIONS ADOPTED LAST YEAR BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. THE BILL PROVIDES NECESSARY CLARITY FOR RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE REGULATIONS THIS BILL WOULD NOT PREVENT OWNERS FROM REQUESTING A BACKGROUND CHECK. BUT REQUIRED THAT IT ONLY PRESENT IN DETAIL BUT BY MEANS OF A BACKGROUND CHECK. THAT DEEMS SUFFICIENT FOR DENIAL WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF RECEIPT. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL GRANTS APPLICANTS THREE DAYS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDING EVIDENCE OF REHABILITATION. REFERENCES AND OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION MY BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT SOMEONE'S PAST IS NOT UNDULY IMPEDE HIS OR HER FUTURE. AS ALWAYS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS ISSUE IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE A STATE OF SECOND CHANCES BUT A FORMERLY INCARCERATED. WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A FAIR CHECK ANY ALREADY UPHILL BATTLE OF SECURING HOUSING CALIFORNIA. S. BY NOON YES EMMANUEL GOMEZ OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION ARE JOINING ME TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTAMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I HAVE S. ABOUT NEW IDEAS HERE WITH US TODAY GO AHEAD PLEASE. A GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS OF THE- MY NAME IS AS BY NEW AS A NUMBER THE ENTIRE. COALITION I HAVE WORKED IN ADVOCACY AND DIRECT SERVICES FOR FALLING CARS RIGHT PEOPLE SINCE I WAS RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION MYSELF IN APRIL TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HOUSING IS A FOUNDATIONAL NEED FOR EVERYONE. AND CONSIDERING FALLING BECAUSE VERY PEOPLE ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE HOMELESS WE ARE NO DIFFERENT. A. R. C. IS ACUTELY AWARE OF WHAT PEOPLE RETURNING HOME NEED TO SUCCESSFULLY REINTEGRATE BACK INTO SOCIETY. AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND MEANINGFUL AND POSITIVE WAY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO WITHOUT ACCESS TO STABILIZE HOUSING. SOMEONE CAN'T BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT EDUCATION WORK AND FAMILY REUNIFICATION IF THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO REST HER HEAD AT NIGHT. AARC MEMBERS WHO TAKE PART IN OUR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROGRAM. ARE PROVIDED THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO FIND THEIR FOOTING. DEFINED QUALITY EMPLOYMENT AND PATHWAYS TO CAREERS. SOME ARE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE ABLE TO RECONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILIES YET WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR THEM TO FIND THEIR OWN HOUSING. THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO WHAT THEN DO THEY TURN TO THE STREETS THEY RETURNED TO A COMMUNITY THAT'S UNSAFE AND UNHEALTHY. ALL OF THEIR UPWARD REMIT MOBILITY IS STIFLED. AND THEY ARE AT RISK OF REVERTING BACK TO SURVIVAL MODE. THIS BILL GIVES PEOPLE A CHANCE FIRST TO BE SEEN FOR WHO THEY ARE. TODAY AND NOT FOR WHO THEY WERE WHEN THEY COMMITTED THEIR OFFENSE AND IT ALLOWS THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW AND FIND STABILITY. THIS BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY IS THE RESULT OF YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. THIS BILL ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO KEEP THEIR ECONOMY THEY STILL GET TO SEE APPLICANTS FINANCIAL INFORMATION CREDIT HISTORY AND LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION EVERYTHING ONE WOULD NEED TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF SOMEONE IS A GOOD AND RELIABLE TENANTS. IF AFTER CONSIDERING THOSE FACTORS THEY STILL WANT TO RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK THEY MAY DO SO. BUT THEY MUST ADHERE TO REGULATIONS ENACTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. BY DISALLOWING LANDLORDS TO ASK ABOUT SOMEONE'S CREEK CRIMINAL HISTORY ON THEIR APPLICATION THIS BILL ENSURES THAT APPLICANTS WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO KNOW ABOUT THE REGULATIONS ARE COMPELLED TO GIVE LANDLORDS INFORMATION. THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'THAVE INSIGHT INTO THAT ALLOWS THEM THE DIGNITY AND ABILITY TO APPLY FAIRLY WITHOUT PRECONCEIVED JUDGMENT OR SHAME. WE ARE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND IF WE BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES AND BELIEVE IN FORGIVENESS THAT WE MUST CREATE POLICIES THAT REFLECT SUCH. FORMALLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE DESERVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE HEALTHY AND STABLE LIVES AS RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I THOUGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THEN WE ALSO HAVE MANUEL GOMEZ THE END OF RECIDIVISM COALITION WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU WITH US. I AM. GO AHEAD PLEASE GOOD MORNING THE MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME ABOUT WHAT ALMOST AND THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUAL A DISABLED MILITARY VETERANS AND OF LONG BEACH STATE GRADUATE STUDENT.

OUR COALITION BELIEVES RENTAL APPLICANTS SHOULD BE JUDGED ON WHO THEY ARE TODAY AND NOT THEIR WORST MOMENTS MANY OF THE THINGS THAT THE SUPPORT WITNESSES SPOKE. ON WE ACTUALLY AGREE WITH. BUT AB TWO THREE EIGHT THREE WITH ALLOW THE- CHECKS BE USED SCREEN RENTAL. AND CLAIMS WERE BY QUOTE FAIR AND THOROUGH THAT CLOSE QUOTE. FOR TWO REASONS ARE COLD DISAGREES BUT THIS BILL. ANY MEANINGFUL FAIR TREATMENT PER APPLICANT THE CONVICTION HISTORY CLAIMS TO PROTECT PERSPECTIVE TENANT DURING THE INITIAL APPLICATION PAGE WHICH INCLUDES THE WRITTEN APPLICATION. RENTAL AND CREDIT HISTORY CHECKS AND IN PERSON INTERVIEWS. BUT AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE DOES NOT REQUIRE LANDLORDS TO MAKE IT CONDITIONAL OFFER APPLICANTS TO PASS THAT THE VISUAL BUT- WITHOUT A CONDITIONAL OFFER FOR APPLICANTS WHO PASS THE INITIAL PHASE NOTHING THIS BILL PREVENTS LANDLORDS FROM SIMPLY GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS. WHILE OFFERING UNIT TO ANOTHER APPLICANT THIS PROMOTES A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY UNDERMINES THE PRACTICAL EFFECT THE BILL. ANY ANTI DISCRIMINATION ENFORCEMENT. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. SECOND AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY THREE ALSO A TO ALLOW APPLICANTS A CONVICTION HISTORY TO PROVIDE. EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF READ THE HAPPEN THREE CALENDAR COULD DO SO WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ACQUIRE ANY SUCH EVIDENCE.

THANK YOU CURRENT MEMBERS A JURY DESMOND ON BEHALF OF THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA. FOLLOWING A REVIEW OF THE MARCH THIRTY AMENDMENT WE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE AUTHOR COMMITTE YESTERDAY WITH OUR CONCERNS WITH ONE SPECIFIC SECTION OF AB TWO SIX ONE SIX. THE PROPOSED NEW SUBDIVISION T. OF PROBATE CODE SECTION TWO FOUR OH ONE ON PAGE TWENTY ONE LINES TWENTY SEVEN THROUGH THIRTY FIVE OF THE MEASURE. OUR CONCERN IS THAT HAS NOW WRITTEN THIS PROVISION PLACES RESPONSIBILITIES ON A CONSTRUCTOR OR GUARDIANS WITH TERMINOLOGY THAT IS BIG OVERLY BROAD. UNDEFINED AND SUBJECTIVE A CONSERVATOR OR GUARDIAN SHALL AVOID EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST. AS WORDED THIS WOULD ENABLE ANY INDIVIDUAL TO ALLEGE THAT AN ACT SOUND VISION OR SOME OTHER SENSORY PERCEPTION HAS CREATED AN APPEARANCE OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THERE IS IN FACT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SECOND IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT A CONSERVATOR OR GUARDIAN SHALL AVOID ANY INTERACTION WITH AN ENTITY THAT BENEFITS THE GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR AND THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE WORKS. WITHOUT FURTHER CLARIFICATION THIS PROHIBITION COULD BE INTERPRETED TO APPLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIONS BETWEEN THE CONSERVATOR GUARDIAN WITH AN ENTITY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THE GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR KNOWINGLY PARTICIPATED IN INTERACTION. WHICH IS LATER DETERMINED TO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THE WAR DIFFERENT SERVICE BEST INTEREST. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHEN EACH CITY. IN THE- THAT PERHAPS EVEN AT THAT OCCUR. EVERY IN. WITH INTENDED ISN'T BEST OF THE CONSERVATIVE OR WORK ADDITIONALLY THAT THE PROFESSIONAL PRODUCERS ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF NUMEROUS WORK TO CONSERVATIVE. THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT A PRODUCER YOU HAVE AN INTERACTION WITH AN ENTITY THAT IS IN THE BASKET INTEREST BEST INTEREST OF ONE BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OTHERS. WE BELIEVE THESE ISSUES COULD BE RESOLVED AND WE PROVIDED THE AUTHOR WITH AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CLARITY TO ENSURE THAT THE SUBDIVISION D. WILL BE WORKABLE AND ENFORCEABLE. THE FOR THE SUBDIVISION WOULD READ. THE IN THE COURSE OF PERFORMING THEIR DUTIES TO ORDER CONSERVANCY A GUARDIAN OR CONSERVATOR. SHALL AVOID ALL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. SHOP ACT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE WORD CONSERVATIVE. AND SHALL NOT ENGAGE IN ANY PERSONAL BUSINESS OR PROFESSIONAL INTEREST A RELATIONSHIP THAT IS REASONABLY THAT IS A REALLY COULD BE PERCEIVED AS SELF SERVING. OR ADVERSE TO THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE CONSERVATIVE AWARD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT TO LINE FIVE SEVEN EIGHT. YOUR LINE OF THE. I'VE SEVENTY EIGHT YOUR LINE OKAY HE TOOK HIMSELF OUT AT FIVE EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

MORNING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- CHAIR MEMBERS. I WANT TO START BY THANKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS ANALYSIS. AB TWENTY TWO OH THREE WILL EXPAND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS BY PROHIBITING HOUSING PROVIDERS FROM REQUIRING CREDIT CHECKS FOR APPLICANTS WITH PUBLICLY FUNDED HOUSING SUBSIDIES. THE BILL WILL ALSO ELIMINATE THE APPLICANT FEES SUBSIDY HOLDERS. ARE FOR SUBSIDY HOLDERS WHICH IS TYPICALLY USED FOR CREDIT CHECKS CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT EFFORTS TO REDUCING RENTAL ASSISTANCE BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SB THREE TWENTY NINE AUTHORED BY FORMER SENATOR MITCHELL PROHIBITED HOUSING PROVIDERS FROM REFUSING TO RENT TO SOMEONE BECAUSE THEY USE A HOUSING SUBSIDY TO AFFORD THEIR RENT. UNFORTUNATELY RENTAL APPLICANTS WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES ARE BEING REJECTED BASED ON POOR CREDIT HISTORY EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DIRECTLY PAYS FOR ALL OR MOST OF THE RENT. THE STATE DOES NOT PROHIBIT A HOUSING PROVIDER FROM CONDUCTING A CREDIT CHECK OR AN APPLICANT USING A HOUSING SUBSIDY NOR DOES THE STATE PROHIBIT REJECTING AN APPLICANT BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THEIR CREDIT CHECK. A RECENT SACBEE ARTICLE CHRONICLED THAMEL BROWN WHO WAS UNDER HOUSE FOR TEN YEARS BEFORE RECEIVING A HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER. OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE MONTHS BROWN APPLIED TO OVER THIRTY APARTMENTS. THAT REQUIRED A FORTY DOLLAR APPLICANT FEET EACH TIME. SHE STILL HOMELESS HOUSING PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES BY REJECTING THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE SHAKY CREDIT. TYPICALLY INDIVIDUALS WHO QUALIFY FOR HOUSING SUBSIDIES ARE LOW INCOME OR HAVE LOW OR NO CREDIT. THEREFORE ASSESSING A RENTAL APPLICANTS ELIGIBILITY THROUGH CREDIT CHECKS CAN EASILY RESULT IN AN APPLICATION DENIAL AS PEOPLE WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES OFTEN HAVE LOW CREDIT SCORES FOR CREDIT OR NO CREDIT HISTORY. MOREOVER HOUSING PROVIDERS TYPICALLY REQUIRE APPLICANTS TO PAY A FEE TO COVER THE COST OF A CREDIT CHECK. THE FEE WHICH CAN BE AS HIGH AS FIFTY DOLLARS CAN PRESENT A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER FOR APPLICANTS USING HOUSING SUBSIDIES. TODAY I HAVE FOUND IN MEMBERS OF STRONGER WOMEN UNITED CALLIE WRITER AND DEBORAH CRAFT PROVIDING TESTIMONY STRONGER WOMEN UNITED ARE A COLLECTIVE OF WOMEN WITH LIVED EXPERTISE IN HOUSING DISPLACEMENT. THANK YOU KELLY WRITER AND WE'RE DEBORAH CRAFT ON THE TELEPHONE OR OTHER THE WITH US YES WHO HAD PLEASE YEAH.

SH I WAS ON HOLD FOR NEARLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS WHILE ON A WAITING LIST. FOR SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DURING THIS TIME I WORKED. AND I WAS DIE WITH CANCER. I SURVIVED CANCER TREATMENTS WHILE LIVING IN A CROWDED SHELTER. MY CREDIT SCORE DROP TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE POINTS WHILE I WAS. MOSTLY BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF INCOME. AFTER TWO AND A HALF YEARS I RECEIVED A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. I THOUGHT HOUSING WAS WITHIN MY REACH HOWEVER I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG. HOUSING POVIDERS REJECTED MY OBLIGATIONS EIGHTEEN TIMES IN A ROW. EVEN THOUGH I HAD A VOUCHER INHERENT. MOST OF THE TIME HOUSING PROVIDERS REJECTED MY APPLICATION BECAUSE OF MY LOW CREDIT SCORE. SH EACH TIME I APPLIED FOR AN APARTMENT MY HOLDS SOARED ONLY TO BE DEFLATED AGAIN. I KNEW THAT I HAD TO USE MY VOUCHER WITHIN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS OR LOSE THAT. I WOULD BE OBVIOUS NOT MY CREDIT HISTORY WAS PREVENTING ME FROM USING MY VOUCHER I BECAME INCREASINGLY DISCOURAGED CARNAGE ANGELS DEPRESSED AND SCARED I FEARED THAT MY VOUCHER WAS JUST ANOTHER BROKEN PROMISE AND THAT I WOULD REMAIN HOSTILE. WHILE SEARCHING FOR AN APARTMENT AND SPENDS AROUND FIVE HUNDRED AND- SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS ON APPLICATIONS. I HAD TO CUT DOWN ON THE FOOD AND JOBS IN ORDER TO PAY THOSE FEES BUT I WAS THE LUCKY ONE NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD THOSE THOSE THINGS. AB TWO TWO OH THREE WOULD REDUCE THE BARRIERS FOR OUR IN HOUSE AND HELPING IN SECURE PEOPLE TO CHANGE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

MISTER JERRY HAVE NO FOR THE SUPPORT QUEUE THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION TO AB TWO TWO OH THREE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM. PLEASE COME FORWARD. THE MORNING WHEN A SEARCH TERM MEMBERS NEVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND AND HEAR THE CONCERNS THAT ARE PRESENTED BY THE A SUPPORT HERE UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T THINK THIS BILL WILL MAKE HOUSING ACCESS EVEN EASIER IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER. IN FACT WE THINK THE APPLICATION PROCESS NOW WILL PRESENT A BARRIER FOR INDIVIDUALS. WITH A VOUCHER. IT PUTS THEM IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS SOMEBODY NOW WITH BAD CREDIT BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS OR LEASE THE LAND THERE WILL NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CREDIT REPORT. OWNERS WON'T READ HOUSING BLINDLY THEY WILL ASK FOR EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND INFORMATION WHAT A CREDIT REPORT DOES THIS AGGREGATE THAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PAST BUT WHAT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. IS WHO YOU ARE TODAY AND GOING FORWARD DO YOU HAVE A JOB DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY DO YOU HAVE A GUARANTOR. DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO WILL VOUCH FOR YOU- THE OTHER FEES ARE ALSO PAID OR NOT JUST ABOUT THE CREDIT CHECK BUT- CHALLENGING A FOREIGN OWNER TODAY AND PROBABLY EVEN. AN APPLICANT IS YOU HAVE TO PAY A FEE IF YOU WORK FOR A LARGE COMPANY TO EVEN ACCESS THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHETHER THAT APPLICANT WORKS FOR YOU- THAT IS A FEW THAT'S OFTEN COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND GIVEN. THE LANGUAGE HERE WE DON'T THINK WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT A FEE FOR THAT. TODAY IF YOU HAVE POOR CREDIT OR NO CREDIT- BE HONEST WITH THE OWNER JUST BE STRAIGHT UP WITH THE OWNER I KNOW THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING BUT HAVE A CONVERSATION. SOMEWHAT LIKE WHAT WE SAW IT EARLIER WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER HAVE THE CONVERSATION- DON'T KEEP GIVING MONEY FOR A CREDIT REPORT. ASK THE LANDLORD WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. ASK A LANDLORD HOW MANY APPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED OFTEN THERE ARE SO MANY APPLICATIONS ALREADY SUBMITTED IT IS A WASTE OF AN INDIVIDUAL EVEN SOMEBODY NOT WITH- AND ACTUAL VOUCHER TO PAY A FEE- LANDLORDS CAN NOT A COLLECTIVE FEET OR RUN A REPORT IF THEY'VE ALREADY OFFERED THE UNIT TO SOMEBODY ELSE WE HAVE LAW ON THAT ALREADY. TODAY THERE ALSO SERVICES THAT AN APPLICANT CAN USE TO HOUSE THEIR CREDIT REPORT SO PUT IT THERE ASK THE LANDLORD IF THE LANDLORD WOULD ACCESS THAT. THE TENANT OR APPLICANT PAYS ONCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARDS WORKING ON A PROCESS LIKE THAT. I'M AND ONE FINAL POINT- I THINK WHAT WE HEARD IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE IS THAT- APPLICANTS HAVE GONE THROUGH STRINGENT PROCESS. THROUGH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE VETTED THAT'S TRUE BUT THEY ARE VETTED NOT FOR THEIR- ABILITY TO PAY BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR INABILITY TO A PAY. SO REALLY WHAT IT IS FOR THIS APPLICANT IS WHAT IS YOUR OBLIGATION GOING FORWARD MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THAT CONVERSATION- AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT I'M WITH THE AUTHOR WHAT DOES THIS REALLY MEAN THE BARRIERS YOU ARE PRESENTING. BOTTOM LINE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING CALIFORNIA THAT'S OUR BIGGER PROBLEM THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO ZERO THREE. ALL RIGHT SAYING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO- THREE AND ONLY. TWO TWO OH THREE.

COMING ON THE PHONE ON THE PHONE FULL OF WITNESSES ON THE PHONE OKAY. SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT THIS BILL THAT'S BEEN SPREAD BY THE OPPOSITION THEREFORE I WANT TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES DO. THIS BILL IS SPECIFIC TO PREGNANCY AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT NO ONE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE PROSECUTED FOR ENDING A PREGNANCY ARE EXPERIENCING PREGNANCY LOSS. AND THE PAST TWO DECADES AT LEAST THIRTEEN UNDRED PREGNANT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED FOR HAVING MISCARRIAGES ARE STILL STILLBIRTHS OR SELF MANAGING AN ABORTION. CALIFORNIA IS NOT EXEMPT FROM THIS DESPITE CLEAR LAW THE ENDING OR LOSING A PREGNANCY IS NOT A CRIME PROSECUTORS IN THIS STATE HAVE CHARGED PEOPLE WITH. HOMICIDE OFFENSES FOR PREGNANCY LOSS TWO EXAMPLES ARE THE CASES OF THE CHELSEA BECKER AND A DOOR PRESS TWO CALIFORNIA WOMEN WHO WERE RECENTLY PROSECUTED AND IMPRISONED FOR THEIR STILLBIRTHS. THESE CHARGES WERE ONLY RECENTLY DISMISSED INNERVATED VACATED AND ONLY AFTER THESE WOMEN WERE BEHIND BARS FOR MONTHS. IN THE CASE OF CHELSEA BECKER AND YEARS IN THE CASE OF A DOOR PRESS WHO IS STILL CURRENTLY IN JAIL PENDING CHARGES. AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE IS INTENDED TO PROTECT AGAINST THE CRIMINALIZATION OF PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. AND PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE AND PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR ANY A TRAGIC SITUATION THAT MAY HAPPEN DURING THE PREGNANCY. THIS IS THE INTENT OF THIS BILL HOWEVER THE OPPOSITION HAS CREATED A NARRATIVE THAT THIS BILL LEGALIZES INFANTICIDE OR QUOTE UNQUOTE THE KILLING OF BABIES. THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. THIS BILL DOES NOT LEGALIZE INFANTICIDE. SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO PERINATAL DEATHS THIS BILL PART PROTECTS PARENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING EXTREMELY TRAGIC PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. AS PARENTS EXPERIENCE TRAGIC SITUATIONS THEY SHOULD NOT BE. SORRY THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTED AS THEY MOURN THEIR LOSS AND NOT CRIMINALIZED. NO PERSON SHOULD HAVE TO UNDER PROSECUTION AS THEY GRIEVE THE TRAGIC LOSS THAT HAPPENS DURING THE PREGNANCY AND THIS BILL PROVIDES THOSE PROTECTIONS. REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDES CLARIFYING THAT NOBODY WILL BE PROSECUTED FOR ANY PREGNANCY LOSS OR PREGNANCY OUTCOME. THEREFORE AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WILL REMOVE OUTDATED PROVISIONS REQUIRING CORNERS TO INVESTIGATE CERTAIN PREGNANCY LOSSES. CLARIFY THAT THE REPRODUCTIVE PRIVACY ACT PROHIBITS CRIMINALIZATION OF PREGNANCY LOSS AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. AND CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION FOR PEOPLE WHOSE RIGHTS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED. I WANT TO THANK OUR SPONSORS THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS ACTION PROJECT. CALIFORNIA LATINAS FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IF ONE HOW LAWYERING FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE NARAL PRO CHOICE CALIFORNIA AND PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA.

I HAVE READ THE PROPOSED AMENDED BELL AND BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE PASSED. EXPERIENCING THE LOSS OF MY BABY ALONE BECAUSE A LOT OF TRAUMA FOR ME AND WHILE I WAS IN CUSTODY I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK WITH PROPER COUNSELING TO HELP ME WITH THE GRIEF PROCESS. EVEN WITH THE COMPANIES AT THE JAIL I WAS AFRAID ANYTHING I MIGHT HAVE SAID THEM WOULD BE. AGAINST ME IN COURT. SO I SAW ALONE. WHILE I WAS IN JAIL MY YOUNGEST LIVING ON MY CUT THE- OF THE TIME. HAD TAKEN INTO THE- AND THE GREATER DOCTOR. IF THE HOSPITAL HAD INVOLVE ONE FOR DUE TO THE OVER HAPPENING. I STILL HAVE CUTS OF MY SON. THE CHARGE WHAT THE CHRISTMAS TO MAKE TWENTY TWENTY AND BY THEN THE- OF A FINAL MONTHS PRIOR. THANKS FOR WITH THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND CAN WITH YOU THAT I WOULD FAIL BY. AT THE BILL IF PASSED THE WOULD PREVENT OTHER P. FROM. WHAT I'D SB PACKAGE I PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE TO ANY. I THAT IN THE FUTURE NO WOMAN WILL EVER PERFECT PREVENTING PREGNANCY.

SH CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A LEADER ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO ABORTION. STRONG COULD AGAIN I THINK FOR THE CARRIAGE OF THE FORCE. THE RECENT CHOPPY ACKERMAN DRIVE HAS BOTH CHARGING HIGH BUT LEAVING A PART. SURE THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT. REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. PROSECUTIONS WERE PART OF A NATIONAL THE WE- TO ESCALATE. IN COURT WHICH OR FURTHER UNDER DRUG WAY. BUT A REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES FIND ANY PROTECT. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT. THE FACT IT HARD TO BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE ACTIONS ARE BORN MOST HEAVILY BY BLACK INDIGENOUS AND OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR- YOU'RE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES HERE TO INVESTIGATE MARGINALIZATION ARE HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT WITH THEM.

MY NAME IS SUSAN ARNOLD I'M A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY AND VICE PRESIDENT OF LEGAL pLEAGUE AMERICA'S FIRST PRO LIFE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING FIFTY TWO MEMBER PREGNANCY HELP CLINICS CENTERS AND MATERNITY HOMES IN EVERY ONE OF YOUR DISTRICTS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PRO LIFE VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS THE BILL ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE IS SO MUCH WRONG WITH AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FIRST CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION ONE EIGHTY SEVEN ALREADY PROHIBITS PROSECUTION OF ABORTION EVEN A BOTCHED LATE TERM ABORTION WOULD NOT BE ACTIONABLE SECOND THIS BILL PREVENTS INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF ANYONE NOT JUST THE PREGNANT PERSON WHO INTENTIONALLY MURDERS AN INFANT EVEN WEEKS AFTER BIRTH HERE'S HOW. THE BILL BLOCKS THE USE OF THE CORONER'S INVESTIGATION AND FINDINGS INTO A BABY'S DEATH IN ANY CRIMINAL OR CIVIL ACTION AND AGAINST ANY PERSON NOT JUST THE MOTHER BUT ANYONE WHO WAS INVOLVED IN ANY WAY WITH THE FETUSES DEATH THEN THE BILL GOES FARTHER IT RESTRICTS THE USE OF THE CORONER'S FINDINGS RELATED TO A BABY'S DEATH NOT ONLY FOR MISCARRIAGE STILLBIRTH OR ABORTION BUT ALSO FOR QUOTE PERI NATAL DEATH DUE TO A PREGNANCY RELATED BECAUSE- EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW. DEFINES PERINATAL AS UP TO ONE MONTH FOLLOWING DELIVERY THE BILL ANALYSIS ADMITS THIS ON PAGE TEN. THE AUTHORS RECENT AMENDMENTS DO NOT CURE THE PROBLEM AS IT STILL REMAINS VAGUE AND OVER BROAD AND ILL DEFINED AND WITH NO MEANINGFUL LIMITS. FINALLY THESE PROVISIONS DIRECTLY CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION. ONE TWO THREE FOUR THREE FIVE WHICH PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF AN INFANT PREMATURELY BORN ALIVE IN THE COURSE OF AN ABORTION. AN INFANT BORN ALIVE HOLDS THE SAME RIGHTS AS AN INFANT BORN SPONTANEOUSLY AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WILL MAKE THIS SECTION KNOWLAND VOID BY PROHIBITING THE INVESTIGATION OF THAT INFANT'S DEATH. THE BILL ANALYSIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THIS CONFLICT OF LAW THAT'S VERY TROUBLING FINALLY IT IS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING THAT THIS BILL TRAMPLES ON FEDERAL IMMUNITY AND CONFLICTS WITH PRE EXISTING CALIFORNIA PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY AS WELL. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT PLEASE. GO AHEAD PLEASE MY NAME IS KATIE KLEIN AND I'M AN ATTORNEY FOR AMERICANS UNITED FOR LIFE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AGAINST THIS BILL. EVEN WITH THE ANALYSIS WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BILL COVERS THE BILL SAYS THE STATE SHALL NOT DENY OR INTERFERE WITH THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO ATTAIN OBTAINING ABORTION BUT WHAT DOES INTERFERENCE MEAN. NOTORIOUS PHILADELPHIA ABORTION DOCTOR KERMIT GOSNELL SPENT DECADES PERFORMING UNSAFE UNSANITARY AND DEADLY ABORTIONS BEFORE FINALLY BEING CHARGED AND CONVICTED WITH FIRST DEGREE MURDER STAFF OF THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH TESTIFIED THAT THEY BELIEVED ANY INSPECTION OR REGULATION OF HIS CLINIC WOULD INTERFERE WITH ACCESS EVEN AS THEY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I BET HE WISHES HE LIVED IN CALIFORNIA EARLIER THIS YEAR A BILL IN MARYLAND ALSO USING THE WORD PERI NATAL WAS PULLED AFTER THE SPONSOR WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS INTENT WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT NO DEFINITION OF PERI NATAL STOPS AT BIRTH. IT'S STATE SANCTIONED INFANTICIDE IS NOT THE GOAL THEN THIS BILL NEEDS AMENDING NUMEROUS CALIFORNIA LAWS COULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL INCLUDING PARENTAL RIGHTS A STATE CRIMINAL LAW AND BORN ALIVE PROTECTIONS BUT THERE IS NO DISCUSSION IN THE RUSH TO GET A GOLD STAR FROM THE ABORTION INDUSTRY. LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE BARRED OR DISCOURAGED FROM INVESTIGATING NEWBORN DEATHS UNDER THE BILL. HEARING THIS TESTIMONY I READ NUMEROUS STORIES ABOUT BABIES THROWN IN DUMPSTERS BUT RATHER THAN EXPANDING CALIFORNIA SAFE HAVEN LOT THIS ASSEMBLY WOULD PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM INVESTIGATING HORRIFIC CRIMES. THE ANALYSIS SAYS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN INVESTIGATE. BUT ONLY UNTIL THEY FIND EVIDENCE OF A MOTHER OR ANYONE WHO'S HELPING HER IS WRONG DOING. AT WHICH POINT THEY OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO LEGAL LIABILITY IF THEY PURSUE THE CASE. IF ABUSERS AND TRAFFICKERS KNOW THAT CRIMES RELATED TO ABORTION OR CHILDBIRTH WILL GO UNINVESTIGATED AND UNPUNISHED. IT WILL LEAD TO MORE CASES OF CHILD ABANDONMENT. AND DEATH AND MORE HARM TO PREGNANT WOMEN INFANTICIDE IS AN ACT OR OMISSION THAT KILLS A HELPLESS BABY. IS ALSO THE LOGICAL NEXT STEP TO BE AN ABORTION SANCTUARY. IF A BABY HAS NO RIGHT TO LIFE AT THIRTY NINE WEEKS AND OF CALIFORNIA SEARCH NO INTEREST IN DEFENDING OR PROTECTING THAT CHILD. THEN WHY WOULD THE RIGHT ATTACH JUST BECAUSE THE CHILD DRAWS BREATH. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BOTH NEED NOURISHMENT PROTECTION TO SURVIVE. NEITHER CAN CARE FOR THEMSELVES FOR YEARS. VOTE NO ON THIS CONFUSING OVER BROUGHT INTO HUMANIZING FELL. THANK YOU. RIGHT WILL NOW MOVE TO OTHERS IN OPPOSITION WE WILL NOT TAKE FURTHER TESTIMONY. BUT ONLY NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WILL START IN THE HEARING ROOM I'M GOING TO AND THEN MOVED TO THE PHONES. I'M GOING TO ALLOW A MAXIMUM OF THIRTY MINUTES FOR THIS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU- THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND EVERYONE THAT THAT SPOKE IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION- OBVIOUSLY A AN ISSUE THAT- BRINGS A LOT OF MOTION BUT I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE AUTHOR BRINGS SUPPORT MEASURE FOR AS WELL AS A COMMITTEE OF WITH THE SUGGEST AMENDMENTS I THINK THAT- AGAIN FIND TO SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND MAKE IT VERY CLEAR WITH INTENTIONALLY. IS AND IS NOT OF THIS LEGISLATION AS WE DISCUSSED THE IMPACTS OF CRIMINALIZING PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IMPERATIVE HE RECOGNIZED THE DESPAIR DISPARATE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIESOF COLOR AND THE ADVERSE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS THAT COME WITH IT- THE THESE INVESTIGATIONS OR PROSECUTIONS RUN THE RISK OF HARMING A PERSON'S HEALTH LIVELIHOOD AND ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND- WE POLICE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES WE ISOLATE PEOPLE FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES WHICH MAKES. GETTING MEDICAL. CARE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. LOCAL FAST INCLUDE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS. AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION OPPOSE A CONVERSATION OF PREGNANCY LOSS. AND WHEN PEOPLE FEAR ARREST INTERNALIZATION THEY'RE LESS LIKELY. TO SEE CARE AND SUPPORT WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST- FURTHERMORE THE RISK OF CIVIL AND CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR PREGNANCY ARE HIGHER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY TARGETED. FOR SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS ATION INCLUDING BLACK INDIGENOUS OTHER PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS. LGBTQ PEOPLE YOUNG PEOPLE PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY AND PEOPLE THAT THE INTERSECTIONS OF THESE VARIOUS IDENTITIES. IS ALREADY H. MEDIX BRANDS FOR WOMEN TO HAVE A PREGNANCY LOSS. LET US NOT LATER THE TRAUMA AND PUNITIVE WAY OF CANNELLA JUSTICES NON TOP OF THE TRAUMA. THAT WOMEN AND FAMILIES ARE ALREADY UP FACING FOR THOSE REASONS. I RESPECTFULLY UP ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE TO MAKE A MOTION TO WITH BOTH. THANK YOU WE DO THAT HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. ANDERSON THANK. OTHER COMMENTS MISS DAVIES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I JUST WANNA BRING SOMETHING UP IN REGARDS TO THIS OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTRY SO BILL. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MY OFFICE LIKE I'M SURE A LOT OF YEARS HAVE HAD CALLS NON STOP. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS A BODY HERE THAT I MEAN I GOT A LOT OF CALLS FROM PEOPLE FROM MY DISTRICT. I ALSO GOT A LOT OF CALLS FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S DISTRICTS AND SOME OF THE CALLS WERE SAYING THAT IF I DON'T LIVE IN THEIR DISTRICT THEY DON'T TAKE YOU KNOW MY OPINION A BY POSITION. AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND US BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY THAT THE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN RIGHT NOW. AND A LACK IN TRUST SO HAVING EACH VOICE HEARD IS SO IMPORTANT NOT TO MENTION THAT. WHEN I VOTE I VOTE FOR MY DISTRICT BUT I'M ALSO VOTING FOR EVERY ENTIRE CALIFORNIA AND THAT THEIR VOICE IS IMPORTANT TO BE HEARD WHETHER THEY'RE IN MY DISTRICT ARE NOT. I JUST THINK THAT WE CAN DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER JOB BUT I THINK EVERYONE BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT YOU'RE- YOU'RE HEARING THEIR VOICES SO. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE TRANSPARENCY IS OUT THERE SO THAT WE CAN BUILD THE TRUST BACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. THIS WORKS YOU MAY CLOSE WELL I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE HERE TO THANK THE CONSULTANTS AND THE CHAIR- IN THE COMMENTS FROM MISTER KALRA- AND AS WELL AS EVERY WITH THE SENTIMENTS AROUND TRANSPARENCY ENSURING THAT WE HEAR EVERYONE OUT I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY PASSIONATE SUBJECT- ONE THAT I'M INVOLVED IN AND OBVIOUSLY HAVE A CERTAIN PARTY BUT I RESPECT OTHER PEOPLE'S POINTS OF VIEW AS WELL OF COURSE- I ALSO WANTED JUST CLARIFIED I MADE THESE CLARIFYING REMARKS TO MY OPENING BUT JUST WANT TO REITERATE THEM. THIS ISN'T THIS IS NOT A BILL ABOUT INFANTICIDE- YOU KNOW I'LL GIVE YOU A TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING THAT IS TRANSPIRED YEAH- THERE WAS A WOMAN WHO WAS EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT SHE WAS IN A VERY TERRIBLE- CAR CRASH THEY HAD TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY C. SECTION AND FORTUNATELY THE BABY DIED AND SHE WAS CHARGED ISSUES PROSECUTED FOR THAT DEATH- SHE SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED OR PROSECUTED FOR ANY KIND OF HOMICIDE OR MANSLAUGHTER IN THAT SITUATION- THAT WAS A PREGNANCY RELATED OUTCOME. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GUARD AGAINST HERE- AND IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TWO WOMEN RECENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN PERSECUTED FOR ON THE LOSS OF A PREGNANCY IN CALIFORNIA IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IS NOT OKAY AND I KNOW THIS IS A HOT BUTTON TOPIC ACROSS THIS COUNTRY- BUT I KNOW I WHERE I STAND ON THIS pHAVE ACCESSTO. SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTIONS THAT WOMEN SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED FOR- YOU KNOW ANY KIND OF PREGNANCY RELATED OUTCOME LOSS OF PREGNANCY- IT'S ULTRA AND SO WITH THAT- AGAIN I WILL HEAR ANYONE WHO HAS SUPPORTER OPPOSITION- BUT I KNOW I FIRMLY STAND ON THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. DAVIES DAVIES NO HOLDEN.

SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TWENTY TWENTY NINE THIS BONTA. GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AND MOMENTS I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION T. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HELP WITH THESE AMENDMENTS. THAT IN THE PAST YEAR MULTIPLE STATES HAVE RAMPED UP THEIR ANTI ABORTION EFFORTS AND PASSED LAWS TARGETING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION LAST YEAR ALONE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS WERE ENACTED IN NINETEEN STATES. THIS INCLUDES TEXAS WHERE THEIR MOST RECENT ANTI ABORTION LAW ENCOURAGES PRIVATE CITIZENS TO ACT AS BOUNTY HUNTERS TO SEEK OUT AND TO THOSE WHO HAVE PROVIDED ANY FORM OF SUPPORT TO PEOPLE SEEKING AN ABORTION. INCLUDING THEIR DOCTOR THIRD NURSE A FRIEND WHO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHETHER TO GET THE ABORTION EVEN THE UBER DRIVER. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT LIKELY TO WITH THE UNITED SUPPORT STATE SUPREME COURT LIKELY TO OVERTURN THE PROTECTIONS GRANTED UNDER ROE V. WADE. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE IMPROVE ABORTION ACCESS AND STRENGTHEN. PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE SEEKING SENSITIVE SERVICES. PEOPLE ALREADY ARE WELL AND WILL CONTINUE TO COME TO CALIFORNIA FOR REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. HOWEVER WE WORRY. THAT OUT OF STATE CITIZENS AND ACTORS WILL DEMAND THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF THOSE WHO SEE KERR HERE TO PUNISH THEM FOR EXERCISING. THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NO ONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MINIMIZE NOT MANIPULATE CALIFORNIA'S LEGAL SYSTEM TO TARGET AND PUNISH PEOPLE WHO SEEK CARE AND REFUGE HERE. MY BILL AB TWENTY NINE WILL ENSURE OUT OF STATE SUBPOENAS WHICH SEEK INFORMATION RELATED TO A PATIENT WHO RECEIVED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT GRANTED BY DOING THIS CALIFORNIA WILL PROTECT THE MEDICAL PRIVACY. OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO MAY BE TARGETED BY HOSTILE LAWS IN OTHER STATES. AB TWENTY NINETY ONE ALSO ENSURES THAT DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE CAN ENFORCE VIOLATIONS OF THE RELEASE OF MEDICAL RECORDS. RELATED TO SENSITIVE SERVICES. CALIFORNIA MUST PROACTIVELY PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL RECORDS AS WE SEE STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY PAVING THE WAY TO USE THOSE RECORDS TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN STATES. ANTI ABORTION LAWS. THANK YOU AND AS A WITNESS TODAY I HAVE LEAD TO MY TO BORA WITH PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU WHEN IS PLEASE. YOU TERM AND STONE AND MEMBERS I AM LISA. FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD AFFILIATES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE SEVEN AFFILIATES IN THE STATE OPERATING OVER A HUNDRED HEALTH CENTERS. THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS UNDER ROE VERSUS WADE ARE NO LONGER ENSURING ACCESS TO ABORTION ACCESS. ABORTION ACROSS THE NATION. EVEN AS THE US SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO ROE. THE COURT HAS ALREADY UPHELD TEXAS SENATE BILL EIGHT AND IT'S DELIBERATE LEGAL SCHEME TO CIRCUMVENT JUDICIAL REVIEW OF AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL LAW. ALLOWING TEXAS TO RELY ON PRIVATE CITIZENS TO USE CIVIL LAWSUITS TO DO TO TAKE AWAY PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE TEXAS ABORTION HAND HAS BEEN IN EFFECT NOW FOR THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS. AT THE SAME TIME ANTI ABORTION LAWMAKERS HAVE INTRODUCED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE RESTRICTIONS IN FORTY ONE STATES SO FAR THIS YEAR. WITH THREE ABORTION BANS BEING RECENTLY ENACTED IN ARIZONA IDAHO AND WYOMING. IN OTHER STATES LIKE MISSOURI LAWMAKERS ARE TAKING AN EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH ATTEMPTING TO BAN RESIDENTS FROM LEAVING THE STATE TO OBTAIN AN ABORTION. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS OVER THIRTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE BOOKS IN OVER HALF OF THE STATES WILL LOSE ACCESS TO ABORTION IN OUR HOME STATE. THESE BANDS DENY PEOPLE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE HARM PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY FACING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM. AND FORCE PEOPLE TO FLEE THEIR HOMES TO GET THE CARE THAT THEY NEED AND THEY DESERVE. WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK THAT THIS STATE AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS DONE AND IS DOING TO ENSURE ABORTION ACCESS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE MUST DO MORE. FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD PROTECTING PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY IS AT THE CORE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUR AFFILIATES. THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS SHOULD NEVER BE USED TO PUNISH SOMEONE FOR OBTAINING AN ABORTION A RIGHT EXPLICITLY PROTECTED UNDER OUR STATE LAWS. AB TWENTY ONE NINETY ONE IS THE ABOLITION SAFEGUARDS IN THE LAW TO PROTECT THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF ABORTION PATIENTS TO ENSURE THIS INFORMATION IS NOT USED AS EVIDENCE. IN AN OUT OF STATE CASE TO PENALIZE THE PATIENT WHO SEEKS CARE IN OUR STATE. IN WOULD SIMILARLY PROTECT THOSE WHO PROVIDE ABORTIONS OR ASSIST PATIENTS TO ACCESS ABORTION KAREN CALIFORNIA. WE THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND FOR THEIR THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR CARRYING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. SO CALIFORNIA CAN BE A SAFE HAVEN FOR THOSE WHO SEEK THE ABORTION CARE IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB.

TWO ZERO NINE ONE IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO ZERO NINE ONE. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JENNIFER MILBORNE I'M THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COORDINATOR FOR ABORTION SURVIVORS NETWORK. THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE SURVIVORS OF ABORTIONS AND THEIR FAMILIES. I BELIEVE THAT MEDICAL RECORDS AND HISTORY ARE EXCEPTIONALLY PERSONAL HOWEVER KEEPING ABORTION AND ITS IMPACT PRIVATE TO CREATE A SAFE HAVEN FOR ABORTION. WILL NOT ELIMINATES COST TO WOMEN AND THE CHILDREN IN HARM'S. I SPEAK WITH SPECIFIC AUTHORITY BECAUSE I AM THE VICTIM OF A FAILED ABORTION. FIRST I DO NOT WISH TO CRIMINALIZE WOMEN WHO HAVE HAD OR SEEK ABORTIONS. OR PUBLICIZE THEIR HEALTH RECORDS. IN FACT IT IS THE HEALTH RECORDS OF MANY OF THE PORTION SURVIVORS THAT I SERVE. THAT HOLD THE KEYS TO THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR FUTURE. SECOND I WISH TO CLARIFY ABORTION IS NOT HEALTH CARE. THE ONLY REASON I AM ALIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE THE FAILED HEALTH CARE MY BIOLOGICAL MOM RECEIVED. THE ABORTION DOCTOR FAILED TO COMPLETE THE ABORTION PROCEDURE. MY LIFE WAS SAVED BECAUSE A DOCTOR FAILED. USUALLY WHEN A DOCTOR FAIL SOMEONE DIES. I WAS NOT A DISEASE THAT NEEDED TO BE TREATED I AM A HUMAN BEING. HOW CAN SOMETHING BE CONSIDERED HEALTH CARE WHEN THE DESIRED OUTCOME IS A HEARTBEAT STOPPED. AN ABORTION AS AN OPTION EXERCISE WHEN WOMEN ARE LEFT UNCARED FOR AND BELIEVE ABORTION IS THE ONLY OPTION FOR THEM. OR THEY ARE FORCED TO HAVE AN ABORTION AGAINST THEIR WILL. THIS BILL WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA A DESTINATION FOR ABORTION. AS STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY RECOGNIZE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND THE SACREDNESS OF LIFE AT ALL STAGES. THE ABORTION INDUSTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL COLLABORATE TO EXPLOIT. VULNERABLE WOMEN AND EXTINGUISH SUPPLIES OF PREBORN INFANTS. YOU MUST SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION WHICH STATES ALL PEOPLE ARE BY NATURE FREE AND INDEPENDENT HAVE INALIENABLE RIGHTS. AMONG THESE ARE ENJOYING AND- DEFENDING LIFE AND LIBERTY. HOW CAN A RIGHT TO AN ABORTION SUPERSEDE MY RIGHT TO LIVE. I URGE YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS BILL. THANK YOU FOR. NEXT WITNESS.

MEMBERS SAY IMPROPER PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE WHICH ENCOURAGES ATTORNEYS TO TAKE ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS CASES AND REMOVES UNNECESSARY HURDLES FOR SURVIVORS REQUESTING. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS ALSO KNOWN AS DVR ROSE. CURRENTLY IT IS UP TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE TO AWARD ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS OF A SURVIVOR WINS OUR DVR- CASES. IN SOME INSTANCES QUARTER ACTUALLY REQUIRING SURVIVORS TO MEET MORE REQUIREMENTS. THAN THEIR ABUSER WHEN AWARDING ATTORNEYS FEES BECAUSE COURTS HEARD CONSISTENTLY APPLYING CURRENT LAW. SURVIVORS NOT ONLY FACED PHYSICAL ABUSE BUT THEY'RE ALSO OFTEN VICTIMS TO ECONOMIC ABUSE ABUSERS TAKE AWAY THEIR VICTIMS FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE DENYING THEM FROM HAVING. HAVING A JOB OR PUT A ARE SPENDING THEIR VICTIMS MONEY WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT AND PUTTING THEM DEEP INTO THAT. THE SLEEVES MANY SURVIVORS WITH LITTLE TO NO RESOURCES WHEN THEY TRY TO LEAVE. PETITIONERS FOR DVR ROSE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY UNDER. UNREPRESENTATIVE I'M REPRESENTED AND MOSTLY WOMEN AND THEIR CHILDREN. WITHOUT REPRESENTATION SURVIVORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LOSE THEIR DVR- CASES- THEY HAVE TO JUGGLE. TRYING TO LEAVE THEIR ABUSER WILL NAVIGATING THE COURTS EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURE. THE SURVIVOR LOSES THEIR CASE THEY WILL BE ON THE HOOK FOR THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COSTS AND FUND THEIR- AND FUND THEIR VIEWS ARE IN THE PROCESS THIS PROCESS IS BURDENSOME DOES NOT PROTECT SURVIVORS OR THEIR FAMILIES AND DISCOURAGES VICTIMS FROM TRYING TO GET A DVR- IN THE FIRST PLACE AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE FIX IS THIS PROCESS BY REQUIRING THE COURT. AFTER ISSUING A DVR- TO ORDER ABUSERS PAPER SURVIVORS ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS THIS ONCE ADVISED MORE TOURNEY'S TAKE UP IN REPRESENTS RIDERS IN THIS CASE. I HAVE WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY COREY HERNANDEZ A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH FAMILY VIOLENCE APPELLATE PROJECT. THANK YOU I DO HAVE COREY HERNANDEZ LISTED SO WITH US BY THE TELEPHONE HEY COREY HERNANDEZ ARE YOU WITH US GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MY NAME'S COREY HERNANDEZ I'M AN ATTORNEY AT THE FAMILY VIOLENCE APPELLATE PROJECT OR NONPROFIT BASED IN OAKLAND BUT WE ARE STATEWIDE AND WE PROVIDE FREE SERVICES TO SURVIVORS OF ABUSE WHO ARE APPEALING CHALLENGING TRIAL COURT ORDERS. THAT APARTMENT LIST- AND IF THERE'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE SEEN AND SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN TWENTY TWELVE- WE THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WE THINK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ESPECIALLY SOME OF THE SALAS FIRST LEADERSHIP- AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE IS A DIFFERENT DIMENSION IS BASICALLY DECIDED TO TWO THINGS FIRST. WE WANT TO EMPOWER MORE SURVIVORS TO BRING FORTH MORE CASES WITH REPRESENTATION WITHOUT THE WORRY THAT THEY MAY BE LIABLE FOR THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS' FEES- OR IF THEY LOSE THEY MAY BE AT RISK FOR PAYING THE OTHER. PERSON'S ATTORNEY SEES FOR THE NEAR ACTED MAKING THE REQUEST AND SECOND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE ATTORNEYS TAKE MORE LOW INCOME SURVIVORS CASES. HAVING REPRESENTATION CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN ANY COURT CASE PARTICULARLY FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHERE THEY HAVE TO INTRODUCE EVIDENCE FOLLOWING COMPLEX RULES FACE THE PERSON WHO ABUSED THEM IN COURT AND TESTIFY IN A PUBLIC SETTING TO VERY PERSONAL DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE. I'M AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED THE CURRENT LAWS BEING INCONSISTENTLY APPLIED AND I WANT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT WORKS AGAINST SURVIVORS SO FOR EXAMPLE- WE'VE SEN SURVIVORS WHO MAY BE OF MODERATE INCOME AND MAYBE THEY CAN AFFORD THEIR OWN ATTORNEY. NOT ALL THAT COMMON BUT IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS- OR MAYBE A SURVIVORS OF LOWER VERY LITTLE IN COMMON BUT THEY CAN MAYBE SCROUNGED UP ENOUGH BY BORROWING FROM FRIENDS ARE GETTING GET- SO THEY MAY BRING FOR THE RESTRAINING ORDER ITH AN ATTORNEY WHEN GET THE RESTRAINING ORDER. AND THAT THE CURRENT LAWS WRITTEN IN THE TVPA THE COURT BUT STILL REFUSED. TO GIVE THEM ATTORNEYS FEES SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COURT THE STATUTE THE LAW GIVEN THAT GIVEN THAT DISCRETION- OR THE COURT COULD SAY THAT WHILE THE SURVIVOR WAS ABLE TO AFFORD THE ATTORNEY ON THEIR OWN- SO THEY DON'T NEED THE RESPONDED TO PAY FOR THAT. AND IN THESE TYPE THE CASE OF AN- SURVIVORS ARE ESSENTIALLY HAVING TO. THEIR IDEAS. SO IF PASSED THE EIGHTY TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE WHICH- HOW THE OUTCOME WILL LOOK IN. IN THE FUTURES IN THAT TIME SCENARIO- UNDER THE BILL COURT WOULD ACTUALLY REQUIRE- TO ORDER RESPONDENT PAY FOR THE ATTORNEYS THE SURVIVORS ARE. FEES IF THAT RESPONSE HAS THE ABILITY TO PAY THOSE- AND OUTSIDE WE THINK THE BILL BRINGS THE TV. AND THAT. SCHEMES OF DOMESTIC BROWN RESTRAINING OR MORE LINE WITH. REMEDIAL LIKE THE FAIR HOUSING ACT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR PETITIONERS TO GET THEIR FEES AND HARDER FOR RESPONDENTS WE ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE. TO GET THE PROTECTION THEY NEED AND WE THINK YOU ENERGY FOR A NIGHT OUT. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A. B. TWENTY THREE SIXTY NINE.

AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN ESTABLISHES CONSUMER PROTECTION GUARDRAILS FOR THE SALE OF GAP WAIVERS AND REQUIRES THE AUTOMATIC REFUND OF THE UNEARNED PREPAID WAIVER CHARGES WHEN THE AUTO LOAN HAS BEEN TERMINATED EARLY.

SECONDLY CAPS THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE CHARGED RIGHT GAP WAIVER RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN AMOUNT. THIRD IT PROHIBITS THE MAYOR THAT DO NOT COVER THE ENTIRE AMOUNT TO FINANCE. AND FINALLY THEY REQUIRED AUTO DEALERS TO MAKE IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES THE CONSUMER AT THE GARDEN GAP WAIVERS. INCLUDING THAT THE PRODUCT IS I'M SELLING CANNOT BE A CONDITION TO THE LOAN OR IF THEY'LL TURN- EVERYTHING PROPOSAL FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT WE- HAVE WE COULD WE'RE NOT ABLE TO BE INVOLVED IF YOU FULL TIME A MAN WE TAKE IN THE COMING TODAY BUT WE'RE OUT. COMMITTED TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I MEAN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. I AND AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN TODAY AND ON THE LINE AS DEPUTY AG BRENDAN READY WITH AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU HEY WE ALSO. HAVE ROSE MERRY ST. CHAIRMAN DOWN BY TEACHER CUNNINGHAM AND MEMBERS I'M ROSEMARY SHE CAN'T PRESENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT AUTISTIC TEEN CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION BUT IT'S SPEARHEADED NUMEROUS FLAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY. TO PROVE PROTECTIONS FOR OWNERS OF NEW AND USED VEHICLES AND THEIR FAMILIES WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN AND APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY MEASURE. AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL WE CONCUR WITH THE TESTIMONY PROVIDED BY THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL CONTACT. PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE WORST ABUSES INVOLVING GAP WAIVERS BENEFITING CALIFORNIA VEHICLE OWNERS IN MULTIPLE IMPORTANT WAYS AND RATHER THAN REPEAT THOSE- BUT TO SAVE IT WE TOTALLY ARE IN SYNC WITH THE AG'S OFFICE ON EACH OF THOSE POINTS. AND I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT AMONG THE STATES THAT OFFERS SUPERIOR STATUTORY PROTECTIONS ARE INDIANA NEVADA TEXAS UTAH. AND WYOMING. USUALLY TOP IN THE READ THE IN PROTECTING AUTO OWNERS AND MINUTES WE'RE SORELY BEHIND- AND CLOSE TO THE GAS IN GAP COVERAGE PARTS GAP WAIVER HOPING OVER THE FINAL SH VICTIMS OF THEFT OR CRASHES EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE GAP WAIVER THAT THEY BOUGHT AT THE DEALERSHIP FAILS TO COVER THE AMOUNTS THAT THEY STILL MUST PAY FOR THEIR AUTO LOAN. AND FOR ALL THE MEANS. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I VOTE FOR AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU READ UP IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN IN THE HEARING ABOUT IT. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN AGAIN WE'RE ONLY TAKING NAME. AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AGAIN THAT'S THE ONE AND THEN THEIR APPEARANCE A PART OF AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE. ONE SEVENTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANNY CANNOT CUTS ARE ON BEHALF OF BOTH THE NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW CENTER AND THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT TO GO TO LINE ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GETTING OF THE CARE OF ON THE TOP OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORTING QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TIMOTHY ME HAN ON THE TELEPHONE AS WELL AS ANTHONY. SAMPSON I'M SORRY TIMOTHY MEAN IN THE TWENTY MINUTE ARE YOU WITH US ON THE PHONE. YES I AM MISTER CHAIRMAN GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU- MY NAME IS TIM MINAMI EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GUARANTEED ASSET PROTECTION ALLIANCE ALSO KNOWN AS GAP WE ARE THE NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR LENDERS INSURERS AND ADMINISTRATORS THAT TOGETHER PROVIDE- THE MAJORITY OF GAP WAIVERS OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS WE'VE WORKED IN- OVER FORTY STATES TO ENACT LEGISLATION NO SURE THAT HAPPENS PROVIDED WITH PROPER DISCLOSURE STRONG FINANCIAL BACKING IN A WAY THAT ASSURES CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED. IN FACT SOME OF THE STATES THAT THE EARLIER SPEAKER MENTIONED- CONTAIN THE MODEL ACCIDENT KAPPA- DEVELOPED IT HAS TAKEN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES NOT ADOPTED OVER HALF THE STATE SO FAR. I SINCE BEEN SAID NOT INSURANCE UPON GAP WAIVER. AND I GO A GOOD. OF HOW GAP WORKS IS A CONSUMER MIGHT BORROW THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PURCHASE CAR. AND IF IT'S TOTALED IN AN ACCIDENT OR IF IT'S STOLEN THE COLLISION INSURANCE COMPANY MIGHT SEND A CHECK FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. LEAVING THE CONSUMER WITH NO CAR AND FIVE THOUSAND AND REMAINING THAT ON THE CAR. YEAH APTOSE WAVE EITHER ALL OR PART OF THAT AMOUNT DEPEND UPON THE TERMS OF THE GAP AGREEMENT AND I CAN TELL. YOU THAT AS CONSUMER PRODUCTS GO. GAP WAIVERS PAY AN AWFUL OF TWENTY AND CAL. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. TODAY WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN IN ITS CURRENT FORM WE SUBMITTED A LETTER ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION OUTLINING- THE AMENDMENTS NEEDED TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. WE DEFINITELY APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMAN MENTIONS WILLINGNESS TO SIT DOWN WITH US AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS WAYS THAT LEGISLATION COULD BE AMENDED TO ASSURE CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT ONE AT THE SAME TIME NOT IT SHOULD BUT THE PROVISION OF THIS IMPORTANT PRODUCT. FRST I WOULD SAY THAT WE DO AGREE WITH SOME WOMEN'S GOAL OF ASSURING THAT IF A PERSON DECIDES TO TERMINATE. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT EARLY FOR EXAMPLE THEY WANT TO. TRADE THE CAR IN OR THEY JUST THEY GOT A TAX CHECK IN THE MAIL AND I WANT TO PICK THE CAR UP EARLY. THERE DOES NEED TO BE A PROCESS TO AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRE THE CONSUMER GETS A REFUND. I'LL BE HONOR AND PORTION OF THE CONTRACT WITHOUT THE CONSUMER HAVING TO REQUEST THAT REFUND. WE SOUGHT LEGISLATION DOING EXACTLY THAT IN OTHER STATES IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS HOWEVER TO REFUND GAP. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PARTIES INVOLVED INCLUDING THE CAR DEALER THE CATHOLIC MINISTRY- THE LANDER AND INSURANCE SO WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO GET THE WORDING IN PLACE TO MAKE IT WORKABLE. WE ALSO THINK THAT IT IS EXTREMELY. TO HAVE- TO PROVIDE THE GAP REFUND AMOUNT- EVERY TIME. THE LENDER WOULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE CUSTOMER. THAT WOULD BE EVERY MONTH THEY SEND ABOUT A STATEMENT. SHOWING HOW MUCH IS LEFT ON THE LOAN OR A CUSTOMER CALLED IN BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING A LATE PAYMENT. THEY WOULD HAVE THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE A NEW CALCULATION EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT HAPPENS- WE- DISAGREE WITH PLACING A CAP ON THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE CHARGED FOR THESEWAIVERS. ONLY THREE STATES TAKE THAT APPROACH. BUT THE REST OF THE COUNTRY RELIANT ON COMPETITION AND I CAN TELL YOU. BOUGHT A CAR RECENTLY YOU KNOW THAT- COMPETITIONS VERY MUCH ALIVE AT CAR DEALERSHIPS THEY WANT TO DEAL AND THEY WANT THE LOWEST COST FOR THEIR CONSUMERS SIR I NEED TO WRAP UP WE WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. YES I THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE HERE BY ALL IN ALL WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH. ASSEMBLY WHEN MAIENSCHEIN AND AGAIN ASSEMBLY. OPPOSE THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. AND THEN ANTHONY SAMPSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON THE SAMPSON ADVISORS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION ONLINE MY COMMENTS- WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM KAPPA- I SEE IN CDA STAKE IN THE PRESENCE AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL AND VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AND ATTORNEY GENERAL'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH US REGARDING OUR CONCERNS- I'LL JUST START OFF BY. STATING THAT WE UNDERSTAND FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THAT ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT THE BILL SEEKING TO ADDRESS IS TO ENSURE THAT ANY UNDER THE MOUNTAINS THAT CAR BUYERS BUYERS PAID FOR GAP WAIVERS ARE PROMPTLY AND AUTOMATICALLY. REFUNDED IF THEY PAY OFF THEIR LOANS EARLIER CANCEL GAP PROTECTION. TNC GAVE VERY MUCH AGREES THAT IT IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE PROMPT PAYMENT OF ANY GAP PROTECTION. REFUND DUE TO THE CONSUMER INTO THIS AND- WE SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE MEASURE. WE HAVE SOME COMPLEX CONCERNS WITHTHE WAY IN WHICH THE BILL SEEKS TO EFFECTUATE THOSE REFUNDS AND WE'VE SUBMITTED AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORED AND SPONSORED HOPES WE CAN. REACH AN AGREEMENT ON THAT ISSUE. MORE GENERALLY I JUST WANT TO KNOW FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT FOR MANY CONSUMERS GAP PROTECTION PROVIDE THE RELATIVELY LOW COST METHOD TO SECURE PEACE OF MIND TO PROTECT AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING TO MAKE PAYMENTS. ON A VEHICLE THEY NO LONGER OWN FOR MONTHS OR YEARS. ESPECIALLY WITH BOTH NEW AND USED VEHICLE PRICES REACHING RECORD HIGHS IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN CONSTRAINTS AND THE REALITY THAT MANY AMERICANS CANNOT AFFORD FOOTBALL FOR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS DOWN ON A VEHICLE PURCHASE. GAP PROTECTION COULD PROVIDE A VALUABLE IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS CONSUMERS THE RECENT STUDY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SHOWED THAT MANY CONSUMERS HAVE CHOSEN TO PURCHASE GAP PROTECTIONS THE MEANS OF PROTECTING AGAINST LOSSES AND PURCHASERS. OVERWHELMINGLY REPORTED. THEIR SATISFACTION WITH THE PRODUCT. WE UNDERSTAND THE CONSUMER OUT OF WITH ANY PRODUCT OF THE MESSES MAKE PRODUCT PERFECT. AND SO WHILE SHE IN CDA WISHES TO WORK WITH THE- IN THE ATTORNEY. LAW TOREACH A SOLUTION THAT MAKES FOR ALL. CMCT BELIEVES. THAT THE BILL IN ITS FORM IT'S PROBLEMATIC FOR SOME OF THE REASONS OUTLINED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE ELEVEN. TAKE NAME AFFILIATION AND OPPOSITION.
