THIS YEAR TAX EXPENDITURES WILL

EVERY DOLLAR OFA TAX

00:09:20.126 --> 00:09:21.594
EXPENDITURE THAT DOES NOT

THAT SAID.

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:43.883
FOR SO THE QUESTION IS ARE THESE

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.384
TAX EXPENDITURES WORTH THEIR

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.253
COST.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.388
IF I IF YOU PROMISE ME THAT IF I

00:09:49.455 --> 00:09:51.123

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.525

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.826

00:09:53.893 --> 00:09:55.761
GIVE YOU THAT DOLLAR.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.930
BUT IF YOU PROMISE ME THAT

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.465
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME BACK TEN

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.000
AND YOU GIVE ME BACK TWENTY FIVE

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:01.901
CENTS.

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:04.603
MAYBE I NEED TO RE EVALUATE THAT.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.572
DEAL.

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.908
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT

00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.343

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.024
PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:28.194
ACCOUNTING OF THEIR

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:33.099

CALIFORNIA IS TRAILING.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.273
WITH TWENTY EIGHT STATES AHEAD

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.743

00:11:01.127 --> 00:11:02.194
AND I HOPE THAT IT'S ONE THAT

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.397
THE LEGISLATURE CAN BUILD UPON.

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:06.565
IT CREATES A BOARD CONSISTING OF

00:11:06.632 --> 00:11:08.200

00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.621
AND THEN IT DIRECTS THE LA -- TO

IN SOCIETY THEN THE AUTHOR MAKES

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:43.962

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.710
BUT IT'S ALSO PSYCHOLOGICAL.

00:27:58.777 --> 00:28:00.045
I DON'T HAVE [inaudible]

00:28:00.111 --> 00:28:02.147

STUDY THEM AND THAT.

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:14.626
THE PRECURSOR EVENTS THAT LED UP.

00:28:14.692 --> 00:28:15.760
THE CRITICAL MOMENT OF THAT

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.729
ACTUAL.

00:28:17.796 --> 00:28:21.332
WOMAN FINALLY COMING FORWARD.

00:28:24.602 --> 00:28:26.337
SO THAT THE PERPETRATOR.

00:28:26.404 --> 00:28:29.474
ADD TO PAY SOME PRICE.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.010
THIS IS ANOTHER AGAIN STEP.

00:28:32.077 --> 00:28:34.679
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.181
TOWARDS MINIMISING SUCH

00:28:36.247 --> 00:28:37.982
INCIDENCES.

00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:39.984
BUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:28:40.051 --> 00:28:40.285
[inaudible]

00:28:40.351 --> 00:28:42.153
DOMESTIC ABUSE.

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.822
AND IN SOME CASES I WOULD EVEN

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:45.457
ARGUE TORTURE [inaudible]

00:28:45.523 --> 00:28:46.891
I VOTE.

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:50.161
THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN.

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:51.429

00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:52.797
JUST WANTS TO SPEAK AT THIS

00:28:52.864 --> 00:28:54.632
POINT SO WILL CALL ON SENATOR

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.935
SKINNER.

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.870
THANK YOU ARE.

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:01.172
MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I STAND

00:29:01.239 --> 00:29:03.274
IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I

00:29:03.341 --> 00:29:05.043
KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT BE

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:06.978
CONCERNED THAT STATUTE OF

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:08.446
LIMITATIONS THERE THERE'S A

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:10.849
REASON WE HAVE THAT ON CRIMES.

00:29:10.915 --> 00:29:12.951
AND CERTAINLY IN THE ISSUE OF

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.953
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IT IS MOST

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.654
COMMON THAT NOT MOST COMMON

00:29:16.721 --> 00:29:18.823
WOULD BE OBVIOUS THAT YOU YOU

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.258
THE VICTIM WOULD KNOW YOUR

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:21.559
PERPETRATOR.

00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:22.861
AND SO THERE'S SOME ARGUMENT

00:29:22.927 --> 00:29:24.562
THAT.

00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:26.164
IF YOU KNOW THE PERPETRATOR WHY

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.632
WOULD YOU NEED A LONGER STATUTE

00:29:27.699 --> 00:29:29.234
OF LIMITATIONS.

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.836
BUT I THINK WHAT WE KNOW.

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.506
IS THAT VERY OFTEN.

00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:36.708
THE PERSON WHO IS THE VICTIM OF

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:38.243
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE [inaudible]

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.245
THEY ARE.

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:41.946
SUSCEPTIBLE TO IT BECAUSE THEY

00:29:42.013 --> 00:29:43.314
ARE DEPENDENT.

00:29:43.381 --> 00:29:45.083
ON THE PERSON.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:46.584
AND WHEN YOU ARE DEPENDENT ON

00:29:46.651 --> 00:29:49.888
THE PERSON IT IS MUCH HARDER.

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:51.556
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE.

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:53.258
THAT YOUR AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN

00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:54.559
THAT CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:29:54.626 --> 00:29:55.660
THERE'S ALSO A GREAT DEAL OF

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:56.961
SHAME.

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.463
SO IT IS MUCH HARDER THAN TO

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.564
REPORT.

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.932
ADDITIONALLY.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.800
MANY PEOPLE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.302
PERSON FINANCIALLY.

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.904
AND SO THEY COULD JEOPARDIZE

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.139
THEY OR THEIR CHILDREN'S

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:09.340
LIVELIHOOD.

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:10.575
WITH REPORTING.

00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.577
SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO EXTRACT

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.379
THEMSELVES FROM THE DOMESTIC

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:17.448
ABUSE BUT STILL NOT BE WILLING

00:30:17.515 --> 00:30:19.184
FOR ANY NUMBER OF REASONS TO

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.051
REPORT.

00:30:20.118 --> 00:30:21.619
AND WHEN THEY FINALLY GET TO THE

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:23.321
POINT IN THEIR LIVES WHETHER

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:24.489
IT'S THROUGH.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:27.292
COUNSELING OR WHETHER THROUGH

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.294
NOT BEING FINANCIALLY OR

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.728
OTHERWISE DEPEND ON THE PERSON

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:31.696
ANY LONGER.

00:30:31.763 --> 00:30:33.965
THEY SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.900
REPORT AND IF THEY HAVE THE

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:38.369
EVIDENCE THEN THE PERSON WHO WAS

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.004
THE PERPETRATOR OF THAT TO

00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:41.472
MYSTIC VIOLENCE SHOULD BE HELD

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.740
ACCOUNTABLE.

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.909
AND SO WITH THAT I ASKED ZERO

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:45.877
VOTE.

00:30:45.944 --> 00:30:46.611
THANK YOU SKINNER CENTERS

SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.184

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:02.260
CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:03.561
THAT WOULD HELP.

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:06.231
EMPOWER WOMEN TO COME FORWARD I

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.032
AM INCLINED TO SHARE ONE OF THE

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:11.469

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:13.538
AND MY A HEARING.

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:14.872
THIS VICTIM.

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:17.442
WAS TIED UP [inaudible]

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:20.411

SHE HAD TO GO TO COUNTY FOR SO

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:25.149
MANY YEARS.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.584
THEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.953
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.755
BY THE TIME SHE DECIDED TO COME

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.757
FORWARD SHE HAD AUDIO.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:34.859
VIDEO.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:36.427
THREATENING LETTERS.

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:39.097
AND SHE WAS TOLD HER TIME WAS UP.

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:40.798
SHE COULDN'T BRING HER

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.367
PERPETRATOR TO JUSTICE BECAUSE

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.868

EVEN WITH THE EVIDENCE SHE HAD.

00:31:46.704 --> 00:31:48.940

I'M COLLEAGUES.

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:21.265
I ASK YOU WHAT TO MARTHA STEWART.

00:33:21.332 --> 00:33:23.868
LARRY KING AND TIM ALLEN.

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:26.404
ALL HAVE IN COMMON.

00:33:26.471 --> 00:33:28.606
IF THEY LIVED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.141
AND THEY REGISTERED TO VOTE THEY

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.476
WOULD BE LEGALLY ABLE TO

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:32.910
REGISTER VOTE AND LEGALLY ABLE

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.579
TO VOTE.

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:36.848
BUT WHAT THEY COULD NEVER DO IN

00:33:36.914 --> 00:33:38.916
CALIFORNIA IS SERVE ON A JURY

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:39.217
[inaudible]

00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.918
WHY?

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.086
BECAUSE ALL OF THEM.

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:43.988
WERE PASSED.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.290
CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.659
NOW ALL OF THEM AS WE KNOW SERVE

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:49.761
THEIR TIME.

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:50.228
HAVE.

00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:53.564
BEEN LAW ABIDING AND GOODS

00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:56.868
CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR SOCIETY.

00:33:56.934 --> 00:33:59.070
AND YET IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.706
BE FOR EVER BEYOND FROM SERVING

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:02.540
ON A JURY.

00:34:02.607 --> 00:34:05.476
THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL.

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.246
NOTION OF JURIES IN OF OUR

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.915
CONSTITUTION IS THAT.

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:13.251
WE WOULD BE [inaudible]

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:14.786
WE WOULD.

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:15.953
THE ABILITY TO GO BEFORE OUR

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.855
PEERS.

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:19.824
THAT IS A JURY OF OUR PEERS THAT

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.626
WOULD DETERMINE.

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.894
AFTER THE EVIDENCE WHETHER WE

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.061
WERE.

00:34:24.128 --> 00:34:25.630
GUILTY OR NOT.

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:29.534
BUT NOW DUE TO THAT FACT.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.602
IN CALIFORNIA IT IS HARD FOR

00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:33.304
MANY PEOPLE TO HAVE A JURY OF

00:34:33.371 --> 00:34:36.474
THEIR PEERS AND IN FACT.

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:39.844
RIGHT TODAY IN CALIFORNIA 30% OF

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.246
OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN THAT

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:44.515
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:47.418
FOREVER BARRED FROM SERVING ON A

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:48.920
JURY WHEREAS HOWEVER.

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:49.921
THEY HAVE THEIR VOTING RIGHTS

00:34:49.987 --> 00:34:52.390
RESTORED AND MANY MANY OTHER

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:54.292
RIGHTS RESTORED INCLUDING THEIR

00:34:54.358 --> 00:34:55.893
ABILITY TO GET PROFESSIONAL

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.028
LICENSES.

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:59.797
AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:01.432
SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO.

00:35:01.499 --> 00:35:02.700
IS.

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:04.202
PROVIDE.

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:07.104
LIFT THAT BAN THAT WE NOW HAVE

00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:11.609
IN STATUTE -- THERE WAS LATE

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.611
OPPOSITION FROM THE DA'S THEY

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.313
DID NOT EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION

00:35:15.379 --> 00:35:16.481
WHEN IT WAS BEFORE COMMITTEE IN

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:18.249
PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.418
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT I'VE SAT DOWN

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.153
WITH THE DA ASSOCIATION AND

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.354
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEIR

00:35:23.421 --> 00:35:25.389
CONCERN IS IN THE EVER CONCERNED

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:29.026
THAT EVEN IF YOU ARE UNDER --

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:30.461
PAROLE THAT YOU WOULD UNDER THIS

00:35:30.528 --> 00:35:32.230
BILL BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:35.166
TO VOTE SO I WILL WE HAVE

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.901
DISCUSSED AMENDMENTS.

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.302
AND I WILL BE TAKING AN

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:40.004
AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.606
SO THAT HOPEFULLY THE DA'S WE'LL

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.074
GET TO NEUTRAL THEY HAVE

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.576
DISTRIBUTED A LETTER CONFIRMING

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:48.246
THAT WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION --

00:35:48.312 --> 00:35:51.182
AND THE BILL ALSO STILL RETAINS

00:35:51.249 --> 00:35:54.252
THE ABILITY FOR THE PROSECUTOR

00:35:54.318 --> 00:35:56.821
OR THE PUBLIC DEFENDER. TO

00:35:56.888 --> 00:35:59.724
BASICALLY STRIKE A JUROR SO TO

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.359
NOT CONSIDER THEM.

00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:03.461
AND IT STILL RETAINS THE

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:05.396
QUESTIONNAIRE PROCESS WHICH CAN

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.865
ASK PEOPLE EVERYTHING.

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:09.500
THINGS LIKE HAVE THEY EVER BEEN

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.736
CONVICTED OF A CRIME SO IF THE

00:36:11.802 --> 00:36:14.739
PROSECUTOR DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE.

00:36:14.805 --> 00:36:16.107
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PASSED

00:36:16.173 --> 00:36:17.808
CONVICTED OF A CRIME THEY CAN

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:20.278
USE THEIR ABILITY TO STRIKE A

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:21.746
JUROR [inaudible]

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:23.848
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS BILL

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.984
DOES IS JUST RESTORE THE RIGHTS

00:36:27.051 --> 00:36:29.020
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE RESTORE

00:36:29.086 --> 00:36:31.722
PEOPLE'S VOTING RIGHTS AND WITH

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.391
THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:35.459
DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:39.564
ITEM SENATOR HERTZBERG.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.433
OUR SYSTEM OF LAWS.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.434
IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THIS

00:36:43.501 --> 00:36:45.469
STATE.

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:47.171

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.824
SO THIS IS THOUGH A MEASURE THAT

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:17.061
ALSO EXTENDS TO SEX EQUITY IN

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:19.563
ALL EDUCATION LAW ALONG WITH

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:21.065
CORRESPONDING STATE LAW.

00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:23.634
IT'S BEEN VITAL TO ENSURE THAT

AS WELL AS GIRLS AND BOYS AT

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.074
EVERY GRADE LEVEL.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.709
IT ENSURES THAT THEY HAVE EQUAL

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:33.510
OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCCESS IN

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:36.080
ACADEMICS AS WELL AS ATHLETICS

00:43:36.146 --> 00:43:38.482
AND CAN SPURS SEWER IN EDUCATION

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:40.784
IN AN ENVIRONMENT SAFE FROM

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:42.853
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.588
AND VIOLENCE.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:46.724
THIS IS AN ITEM TITLE NINE IS

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.226
THERE TO PROTECT IN THE AREA OF

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:51.428
SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:53.630
ASSAULT BUT SADLY AND SOMEWHAT

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:54.698
SHOCKINGLY.

00:43:54.765 --> 00:43:57.201
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND VIOLENCE IN

00:43:57.267 --> 00:44:00.671
IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS PERVASIVE.

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:02.673
ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

EXPERIENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:28.098
IN COLLEGE HOWEVER DUE TO THE

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.533
UNDER REPORTING THAT WE KNOW

THESE ARE YOU KNOW FORMALLY

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:43.981
UNDER REPORTED SO THE NUMBERS

00:44:44.048 --> 00:44:46.583
ARE MOST LIKELY EVEN HIGHER BUT

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:51.655
YET ONE IN FIVE AND ONE IN

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:52.990
FOURTEEN IS TOO MANY.

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:54.158
THE EFFECTS OF THIS ARE OFTEN

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:54.858
DIRE.

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.627
STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL

WHEN SCHOOLS DO NOT

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.939
APPROPRIATELY RESPOND.

00:45:09.006 --> 00:45:10.574
TO AND OR INVESTIGATE THESE

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:12.576
INCIDENTS ONE OF THE MANY

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.678
HARMFUL RESULTS OF CAMPUS

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.613
SURROUNDS MEANT AND THE SALT IS

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.015
THE PUSH OUT.

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.583
THAT OFTEN OCCURS WHEN SCHOOLS

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:22.219
DO NOT TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO

00:45:22.286 --> 00:45:23.587
RESPOND TO THESE INCIDENTS.

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:27.257
AND AN ESTIMATED 34%.

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:29.126
THAT'S WHY ONE IN THREE OF

00:45:29.193 --> 00:45:31.428
STUDENT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL

00:45:57.354 --> 00:45:59.223
THE CONCERN THAT THERE IS

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.291
DISMANTLING OF TITLE NINE

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.826

THAT HAS EXPRESSED OPEN

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:07.865
HOSTILITY BOTH OF THE SAFEGUARDS

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.833
THE TITLE NINE PRESENTS AND TO

ADDRESSING GENDER BASED VIOLENCE

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:12.636
IN GENERAL.

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.872
IT HAS IN FACT ALREADY PROPOSED

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:17.207
FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT GOT

00:46:17.274 --> 00:46:18.542
TITLE NINE'S CRITICAL

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.577
PROTECTIONS SO WHAT DO WE DO

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:21.678
WHEN THAT HAPPENS HERE IN

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:26.016
CALIFORNIA WE MOVED. TO CODIFY

00:46:26.083 --> 00:46:27.417
THOSE IMPORTANT PROCEDURES TO

00:46:27.484 --> 00:46:29.686
MAKE SURE WE CAN PROTECT AGAINST

00:46:29.753 --> 00:46:31.755
THAT KIND OF DE CONSTRUCTION

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:33.957
GOING ON THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:35.692
TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS BOTH

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:37.294

IN THE COLLEGE SETTING SO THIS

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:41.732
MEASURE DOES THE FOLLOWING IT

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.534
ADDS SEXUAL VIOLENCE TO THE

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.770
DEFINITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:47.971
IN THE EDUCATION CODE.

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:50.040
IT DIRECTS ALL POST SECONDARY

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.341

VIOLENCE PREVENTION BECAUSE WE

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.318
KNOW PREVENTION IS ALWAYS THE

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.086
BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH THESE

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:05.255
PROBLEMS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.957

COMPLAINTS.

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:15.799
IT ALSO REQUIRES AN EDUCATIONAL

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:17.734
INSTITUTION TO TAKE IMMEDIATE

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:19.703
ACTION WHEN IT FINDS AND SEXUAL

00:47:21.805 --> 00:47:23.740
ENVIRONMENT. TO ELIMINATE THAT

00:47:23.807 --> 00:47:25.809

THINK HER MOTIVATIONS -- ARE

00:48:32.175 --> 00:48:35.445
MERITORIOUS ON ON THIS PROPOSED

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:38.081
PIECE OF LEGISLATION -- I'M

00:48:38.148 --> 00:48:40.117
AFRAID HOWEVER THAT WE MIGHT BE

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:43.520

THINK IS.

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.861

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:53.897

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:59.836
IN THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION --

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.805
SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES WHAT WE

COMPONENT OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM.

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:12.716

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.651
PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT THAT

00:49:14.718 --> 00:49:16.753
IS NO LONGER THE CASE THAT

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.922
INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED WILL HAVE TO

I AGREE WITH THIS WITH CENTER

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:31.301
FROM SANTA BARBARA THERE IS AN

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:34.371
INTOLERABLE UNACCEPTABLE LEVEL.

00:49:46.283 --> 00:49:48.518

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.889
PROVISION THAT WE ALL ABIDE BY.

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:54.624

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:02.405
BUT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA VOTERS

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.074
VOTED AGAINST RENT CONTROL.

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.410
THIS IS A BACK DOOR TOWARD RENT

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.378
CONTROL.

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:13.382

BEGINNING UNITS.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.387
IT IS ONLY A MOMENT OR TWO

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.056

THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE THIS IS

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:29.832

FRANKLY THIS IS REALLY JUST A

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.839
RESTATEMENT OF WHAT.

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.941
CURRENT CASE LAW SAYS ABOUT THE

01:05:12.008 --> 01:05:13.676

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:47.307
THE DIFFERENCE.

01:50:47.374 --> 01:50:49.142

NONPROFIT WHO WHO'S ALREADY

02:33:49.653 --> 02:33:51.121

MUNICIPALITY BENEFIT MORE SO --

02:33:59.964 --> 02:34:02.666
BY ALLOWING TO COUNT THE SHEER

02:34:02.733 --> 02:34:04.001
HOUSING UNITS AGAINST THEIR

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:06.170
REGIONAL KIND OF THRESHOLD I

02:34:06.236 --> 02:34:07.705
THINK EVERYONE BENEFITS I THINK

02:34:07.771 --> 02:34:09.940
THE THE SENIOR BENEFITS BECAUSE

02:34:10.007 --> 02:34:12.009

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:12.610
HOUSING.

02:34:12.676 --> 02:34:14.144
I THINK THE NONPROFIT BENEFITS

02:34:14.211 --> 02:34:15.212
BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE PULLING

02:34:15.279 --> 02:34:17.848
MULTIPLE INCOMES AND I THINK THE

02:34:17.915 --> 02:34:19.683
MINISTER POLITY BENEFITS BECAUSE

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.385

THE ARENA NUMBER.

02:34:22.353 --> 02:34:23.454

HOW IT WORKS FOR THE NONPROFIT

02:34:29.159 --> 02:34:33.397
BUT I THINK IT'S AN INTENT TO

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:34.365
TRY TO MAKE EVERYBODY IN THAT.

02:34:34.431 --> 02:34:36.000

02:34:36.066 --> 02:34:36.600

THEY FORCE IT ON ANOTHER

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:11.428
COMMUNITY AND THEY GET THE VOTES

02:36:11.495 --> 02:36:12.262
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

02:36:12.329 --> 02:36:14.465

AND I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT.

02:36:22.239 --> 02:36:23.607
SENIOR HOMELESSNESS IS THE

02:36:23.674 --> 02:36:25.476
LARGEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE

02:36:25.542 --> 02:36:28.512

FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED THEIR

02:36:31.315 --> 02:36:33.183
ENTIRE LIFE AND END UP HOMELESS

02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:34.084

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.592
DIRECTION I JUST THINK THERE HAS

02:36:41.658 --> 02:36:42.893
TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY.

02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:45.362
AND AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEANS OR

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:46.797
HAS TO BE A SYSTEM SET UP.

02:36:46.864 --> 02:36:49.700
SO THAT YOU CAN VERIFY.

02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:51.168

THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK

02:36:57.641 --> 02:36:59.109
TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER

02:36:59.176 --> 02:37:01.044
PEOPLE END UP -- TO MAKE SURE

02:37:01.111 --> 02:37:02.880
THAT IT WORKS AND SO I I THINK

02:37:02.946 --> 02:37:05.415
IT SAID IT BEFORE IT'S TIME.

02:37:05.482 --> 02:37:07.451

02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:14.291
HOUSING CRISIS SHORTAGE.

02:37:14.358 --> 02:37:17.194
AND AND AND THERE'S NO WAY TO

02:37:17.261 --> 02:37:19.863
VERIFY -- THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:37:19.930 --> 02:37:21.532
ARE ACTUALLY OPENING THEIR HOMES

02:37:21.598 --> 02:37:22.900

PLANNING TO PUT IN PLACE OF THAT

02:42:55.599 --> 02:42:57.100
THIS INFORMATION.

02:42:57.167 --> 02:42:58.869
IS NOT AGGREGATED AND USED IN

02:42:58.935 --> 02:43:00.570
WAYS THAT ARE OTHER THAN WHAT

02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:02.706
THIS BILL PURPORTS TO DESIGN

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:04.174

02:43:11.148 --> 02:43:12.015
THAT.

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:13.150
THE WORK THAT'S DONE TO

02:43:13.216 --> 02:43:15.685
CONSOLIDATE THESE DATA SYSTEMS.

02:43:15.752 --> 02:43:18.522

SYSTEM REPORTS COLLECTED.

02:43:20.123 --> 02:43:21.791
BUT AS WE BRING IT TOGETHER IN

02:43:21.858 --> 02:43:23.693
AN ACCUMULATION THAT ALL EFFORTS

02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:25.162
ARE MADE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY

02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:26.596

NONE OF THAT DATA IS TRACKED AS

A PERSON BUT RATHER AS A NUMBER

02:43:31.067 --> 02:43:32.169
AND THAT'S REALLY PART OF THE

02:43:32.235 --> 02:43:33.403
FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE

02:43:33.470 --> 02:43:34.571
AND WHY THESE SYSTEMS ARE

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:36.106
COMMUNICATING BECAUSE THE

02:43:39.442 --> 02:43:40.610
IS A DIFFERENT NUMBER IN A

02:43:40.677 --> 02:43:42.879
DIFFERENT SYSTEM SO THIS BILL I

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:47.717
IDENTIFIES THAT TASK FORCE TO TO

02:43:47.784 --> 02:43:49.019
WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS.

02:43:49.085 --> 02:43:49.653
HOLIDAY DATA SYSTEM THE BILL

02:43:49.719 --> 02:43:50.987
CALLS OUT PRIVACY IS A

02:43:51.054 --> 02:43:52.989
REQUIREMENT FOR THE WORK THAT

02:43:53.056 --> 02:43:54.457
THEY DO AND IT IS A VERY

02:43:54.524 --> 02:43:56.059
IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

02:43:56.126 --> 02:43:57.761

02:44:02.299 --> 02:44:04.067
TIME WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE

02:44:04.134 --> 02:44:06.636
BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY

02:44:06.703 --> 02:44:07.938

ONLY PROTECTED.

02:44:53.383 --> 02:44:55.952
BUT AGAINST THE BREACHES SO WE

FUTURE OF WORK. TO GO FURTHER UP

02:45:41.998 --> 02:45:43.667
THAT PIPELINE AND LOOK AT HOW

WHAT THE OUTCOMES ARE SO I THINK

02:45:51.675 --> 02:45:53.777

A PERSON OF COLOR LOWER INCOME

02:51:59.242 --> 02:52:01.577

02:54:02.565 --> 02:54:04.000
IS MISLEADING ABOUT STE.

02:54:04.066 --> 02:54:05.868
OPPONENTS ARE ALSO ADVANCING THE

02:54:05.935 --> 02:54:07.436
NARRATIVE THAT REPEALING THIS

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:09.839
ENHANCEMENT WILL SOMEHOW REDUCE

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:11.240
JUDICIAL DISCRETION IN

02:54:11.307 --> 02:54:12.675
SENTENCING.

02:54:12.742 --> 02:54:14.610
BUT IS ALSO UNTRUE AS JUDGES

02:54:14.677 --> 02:54:15.611
WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:54:15.678 --> 02:54:17.380
SIGNIFICANT DISCRETION AND

02:54:17.446 --> 02:54:18.948
IMPOSING SENTENCES ON REPEAT

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:21.517
OFFENDERS.

02:54:21.584 --> 02:54:22.051
HI.

02:54:22.118 --> 02:54:23.486
WE KNOW THAT IN VARIOUS RESPECTS

02:54:23.553 --> 02:54:25.755
WHETHER IT IS IMPOSING THE LOWER

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:27.323
MID OR HIGH RANGE OF A SENTENCE

02:54:27.390 --> 02:54:29.792
OR OTHER ENHANCEMENTS AND THEIR

02:54:29.859 --> 02:54:30.359
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY OTHER

02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:31.027
ENHANCEMENTS.

02:54:31.093 --> 02:54:32.762
BY JUDGES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE

02:54:32.829 --> 02:54:33.930
DISCRETION.

02:54:33.996 --> 02:54:36.265
AND SPECIFIC TO SERIOUS AND

02:54:36.332 --> 02:54:38.201
VIOLENT FELONIES.

02:54:38.267 --> 02:54:39.902
BY THERE IS A SEPARATE FIVE YEAR

02:54:39.969 --> 02:54:41.771
ENHANCEMENT. FOR REPEAT

02:54:41.838 --> 02:54:44.807
OFFENDERS AND YOU CAN'T IMPOSE

02:54:44.874 --> 02:54:45.942
BOTH THE ONE YEAR AND THE FIVE

02:54:46.008 --> 02:54:48.277
YEAR AND SO THIS ONE YEAR

02:54:48.344 --> 02:54:50.213
ENHANCEMENT IS NOT GOING TO

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:52.815
REPEALING IT WILL NOT UNDERMINE.

02:54:52.882 --> 02:54:54.617
THE ABILITY OF JUDGES TO

02:54:54.684 --> 02:54:57.286
SEVERELY PUNISH REPEAT SERIOUS

02:54:57.353 --> 02:54:59.155
AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS.

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:00.456
MORE BROADLY SPEAKING COLLEAGUES

02:55:00.523 --> 02:55:02.558
WE ARE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM

02:55:02.625 --> 02:55:05.061
CALIFORNIA'S UGLY HISTORY OF

02:55:05.127 --> 02:55:06.829
MASS INCARCERATION.

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:08.931
OUR STATE ONE FROM TWENTY

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:11.934
THOUSAND STATE INMATES IN.

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:12.468
NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT TWO

02:55:12.535 --> 02:55:13.870
HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND IN

02:55:13.936 --> 02:55:15.037
TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT WITH A

02:55:15.104 --> 02:55:16.839
QUADRUPLING OF THE RATE OF

02:55:16.906 --> 02:55:18.207
INCARCERATION.

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:19.575
AND FOCUSING DISPROPORTIONATELY

02:55:19.642 --> 02:55:21.811
ON BLACK AND LATINO PEOPLE

02:55:21.878 --> 02:55:23.079
TEARING APART FAMILIES AND

02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:24.580
COMMUNITIES.

02:55:24.647 --> 02:55:26.616
CALIFORNIA BILL TWENTY THREE NEW

02:55:26.682 --> 02:55:28.484
STATE PRISONS TO HOLD THIS

02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:29.752
BURGEONING POPULATION.

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.020
AND IN THE PROCESS FOR MANY

02:55:31.087 --> 02:55:32.989
YEARS WE SPENT MORE ON OUR

02:55:33.055 --> 02:55:35.157
PRISON SYSTEM THAN ON CSU AND

02:55:35.224 --> 02:55:37.126
YOU SEE COMBINED.

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:38.261
BY IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE BEEN

02:55:38.327 --> 02:55:40.930
WORKING AS A STATE TO REPAIR THE

02:55:40.997 --> 02:55:43.032
DAMAGE TO OUR BUDGET AND TO OUR

02:55:43.099 --> 02:55:44.400
COMMUNITY SAID HAS BEEN

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:47.103
INFLICTED BY THIS BAD SYSTEM.

02:55:47.169 --> 02:55:48.971
WE CAN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE

02:55:49.038 --> 02:55:50.406
FOR THEIR BEHAVIOR.

02:55:50.473 --> 02:55:51.707
WITHOUT EXCESSIVELY LONG

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:53.042
SENTENCES TO DESTROY PEOPLE'S

02:55:53.109 --> 02:55:54.744
LIVES.

02:55:54.810 --> 02:55:56.779
TURNING A TWO YEAR BASS SENTENCE

02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:58.781
FOR A LOW LEVEL CRIME IN TWO OR

02:55:58.848 --> 02:56:00.349
THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE YEAR

02:56:00.416 --> 02:56:03.185
SENTENCE JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

02:56:03.252 --> 02:56:05.288
RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT THESE

02:56:05.354 --> 02:56:07.156
ENHANCEMENTS ARE INEFFECTIVE.

02:56:07.223 --> 02:56:09.025
IT DOES NOT MAKE US SAFER.

02:56:09.091 --> 02:56:10.593
COLLEAGUES SP ONE THIRTY SIX

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:12.929
PUTS AN END TO THIS A RATIONAL

02:56:12.995 --> 02:56:14.664
INEFFECTIVE COSTLY AND

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:15.932
UNNECESSARY SENTENCING

02:56:15.998 --> 02:56:18.301
ENHANCEMENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:19.869
FOR DR -- THANK YOU SENATOR

02:56:19.936 --> 02:56:22.138
WIENER MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND

02:56:22.204 --> 02:56:24.373
DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN.

02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:25.708
THAT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND

02:56:25.775 --> 02:56:27.176
GENTLEMEN THE SENATE.

02:56:27.243 --> 02:56:28.911
THIS ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT MONEY

02:56:28.978 --> 02:56:30.379
IT'S ABOUT JUSTICE [inaudible]

02:56:30.446 --> 02:56:32.915
JUSTICE.

02:56:32.982 --> 02:56:36.452
AND CONSEQUENCES GO HAND IN HAND.

02:56:36.519 --> 02:56:38.421
AND CONSEQUENCES MEAN.

02:56:38.487 --> 02:56:40.723
IF YOU IMPROVE.

02:56:40.790 --> 02:56:41.724
THE CONSEQUENCES IMPROVE.

02:56:41.791 --> 02:56:43.893
IF YOU DO NOT.

02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:46.729
THE CONSEQUENCES INCREASE.

02:56:46.796 --> 02:56:48.497
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL

02:56:48.564 --> 02:56:51.767
ABOUT THE ENHANCEMENTS. ONE OF

02:56:51.834 --> 02:56:53.669
THE DEFICIENCIES OF TERM LIMITS

02:56:53.736 --> 02:56:55.871
IS LACK OF INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY

02:56:55.938 --> 02:56:57.440
OR INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY OF

02:56:57.506 --> 02:56:59.842
WHAT WENT ON BEFORE.

02:56:59.909 --> 02:57:01.110
AND IN SENTENCING THROUGH THE

02:57:01.177 --> 02:57:02.845
SEVENTIES.

02:57:02.912 --> 02:57:03.679
WE WERE UNDER SOMETHING WAS

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:06.215
CALLED THE INDETERMINATE

02:57:06.282 --> 02:57:07.049
SENTENCE.

02:57:07.116 --> 02:57:08.584
THAN A PROBOARDS MADE MOST ALL

02:57:08.651 --> 02:57:11.253
THE DECISIONS WHETHER OR NOT AND

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:13.589
WHEN SOMEONE WOULD BE RELEASED.

02:57:13.656 --> 02:57:15.157
BOTH LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES.

02:57:15.224 --> 02:57:17.693
DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:20.229
AND SOUGHT A CHANGE. TO A

02:57:20.296 --> 02:57:23.165
DETERMINATE SENTENCE SYSTEM. FOR

02:57:23.232 --> 02:57:24.600
THE CONSERVATIVES THEN THEY

02:57:24.667 --> 02:57:25.935
WOULD NOT HOLD THAT THIS

02:57:26.002 --> 02:57:27.570
INDIVIDUAL WOULD SERVICE SO MUCH

02:57:27.636 --> 02:57:29.071
TIME.

02:57:29.138 --> 02:57:31.540
AND THE BE LESS.

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.341
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO GET

02:57:32.408 --> 02:57:34.643
OUT CALLED EARLY.

02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:36.746
THE MORE LIBERAL PERSUASION.

02:57:36.812 --> 02:57:38.948
WERE ENTICED BECAUSE THE INMATE

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:41.417
WOULD KNOW WHEN THEY WOULD BE

02:57:41.484 --> 02:57:44.253
RELEASED SO WHAT PASSED.

02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:45.454
AND BOTH SIDES INCLUDING THE

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:46.922
GOVERNOR WHO SIGNED THAT

02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:48.057
LEGISLATION.

02:57:48.124 --> 02:57:50.526
LIVE TO RUE THE DAY.

02:57:50.593 --> 02:57:52.094
THE GOVERNOR EVEN SAID THAT.

02:57:52.161 --> 02:57:54.663
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

02:57:54.730 --> 02:57:56.065
WE WENT OVER THEN AND NOW

02:57:56.132 --> 02:57:57.233
THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED

02:57:57.299 --> 02:58:00.002
REALIGNMENT.

02:58:00.069 --> 02:58:02.938
NOW AS TO SAVING MONEY THAT CAN

02:58:03.005 --> 02:58:05.341
GO IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION.

02:58:05.408 --> 02:58:06.742
WE'VE BEEN IN THE THROES OF THIS

02:58:06.809 --> 02:58:08.077
REALIGNMENT OF THE CRIMINAL

02:58:08.144 --> 02:58:09.211
JUSTICE SYSTEM FOR ABOUT FIVE

02:58:09.278 --> 02:58:11.680
YEARS NOW.

02:58:11.747 --> 02:58:15.084
IN THOSE FIVE YEARS GUESS WHAT

02:58:15.151 --> 02:58:15.818
IN CONSERVATION COST OF DONE

02:58:15.885 --> 02:58:16.118
[inaudible]

02:58:16.185 --> 02:58:17.620
CALIFORNIA [inaudible]

02:58:17.686 --> 02:58:19.755
GOT UP.

02:58:19.822 --> 02:58:21.924
THE SO CALLED RE ALIGNMENT

02:58:21.991 --> 02:58:22.758
DIVIDEND.

02:58:22.825 --> 02:58:24.927
MY TERM.

02:58:24.994 --> 02:58:26.762
DID NOT HAPPEN.

02:58:26.829 --> 02:58:30.433
THE COST OF INCREASED.

02:58:30.499 --> 02:58:31.367
THERE WILL BE ARGUMENTS BUT THE

02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:33.235
REASONS BUT THAT IT INCREASED.

02:58:33.302 --> 02:58:37.206
CANNOT BE ON NOW.

02:58:37.273 --> 02:58:39.241
IN TERMS OF REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR

02:58:39.308 --> 02:58:40.376
THEIR TWO THINGS THAT I

02:58:40.443 --> 02:58:41.577
MENTIONED.

02:58:41.644 --> 02:58:43.245
REPETITIVE BEHAVIOR.

02:58:43.312 --> 02:58:46.015
AN ESCALATING BEHAVE.

02:58:46.082 --> 02:58:47.817
THAT MEANS IF YOU KEEP DOING THE

02:58:47.883 --> 02:58:48.884
SAME THING EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE

02:58:48.951 --> 02:58:50.352
A LOWER LEVEL [inaudible]

02:58:50.419 --> 02:58:53.055
DRUG OFFENSE.

02:58:53.122 --> 02:58:53.956
THAT'S SHOWING CONCRETION

02:58:54.023 --> 02:58:58.227
DISREGARD. FOR THE LAW

02:58:58.294 --> 02:58:58.527
[inaudible]

02:58:58.594 --> 02:58:59.929
THE CONSEQUENCES.

02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:02.932
VIOLATING THE LAW.

02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:04.633
ESCALATING BEHAVIOR THERE'S ONLY

02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:06.669
TAKE THAT NEXT STEP.

02:59:06.735 --> 02:59:08.003
THE BETTER EXAMPLE IS A PERSON

02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:09.772
THAT.

02:59:09.839 --> 02:59:12.241
FIRST THEY JUST GRAB AND RUN.

02:59:12.308 --> 02:59:13.943
THEN THEY GRAB AND RUN.

02:59:14.009 --> 02:59:15.644
THE WOMAN RESIST.

02:59:15.711 --> 02:59:17.680
AND SHE GETS BEAT [inaudible]

02:59:17.746 --> 02:59:19.715
ESCALATING BEHAVIOR.

02:59:19.782 --> 02:59:20.649
THE ENHANCEMENTS AFTER THE

02:59:20.716 --> 02:59:23.519
PASSAGE.

02:59:23.586 --> 02:59:25.821
THE DETERMINANT SENTENCE LAW.

02:59:25.888 --> 02:59:26.689
WERE PUT.

02:59:26.755 --> 02:59:28.390
ON THE BOOKS.

02:59:28.457 --> 02:59:31.527
BY SUCCESSIVE LEGISLATORS.

02:59:31.594 --> 02:59:33.262
GOVERNORS AND EVEN THE PEOPLE OF

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:36.565
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:59:36.632 --> 02:59:38.901
FAIRLY RECENTLY IN FACT.

02:59:38.968 --> 02:59:41.337
THE MARSHES LAW.

02:59:41.403 --> 02:59:42.671
THE PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED THAT

02:59:42.738 --> 02:59:44.373
YES SIR DO NEED TO BE INCREASING

02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:45.875
CONSEQUENCES FOR REPETITIVE

02:59:45.941 --> 02:59:47.643
BEHAVIOR.

02:59:47.710 --> 02:59:48.644
AND THAT'S VERY SIMPLY WHAT THIS

02:59:48.711 --> 02:59:50.980
IS ALL ABOUT.

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:51.914
IF YOU VOTE FOR IT.

02:59:51.981 --> 02:59:53.883
DON'T HARBOR IN THE EXPECTATIONS

02:59:53.949 --> 02:59:56.152
AT CSU AND YOU SEE ARE GONNA GET

02:59:56.218 --> 02:59:57.553
RATE INCREASES IN THE BUDGET

02:59:57.620 --> 02:59:59.255
NEXT YEAR.

02:59:59.321 --> 03:00:00.890
THEY HAVE A NOR WILL THEY LET'S

03:00:00.956 --> 03:00:02.625
THINK ABOUT.

03:00:02.691 --> 03:00:06.529
CONSEQUENCES AND JUSTICE.

03:00:06.595 --> 03:00:08.030
THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN CENTER

THIS BILL [inaudible]

03:00:15.104 --> 03:00:18.974
AND I HAVE IN MY HANDS.

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:20.776
THE SEVEN PAGES AND YOU CAN SEE

03:00:20.843 --> 03:00:25.414
THE SIZE OF A OF ALL OF THE

03:00:25.481 --> 03:00:27.016
SECTIONS OF THE PENAL CODE. FOR

03:00:27.082 --> 03:00:29.051
WHICH CALIFORNIA OVER THE YEARS

03:00:29.118 --> 03:00:31.921
HAS ADDED AN ENHANCEMENT.

03:00:31.987 --> 03:00:33.255
NOW I ASK THE LA.

03:00:33.322 --> 03:00:34.990
BECAUSE YOU KNOW VERY COMMONLY

03:00:35.057 --> 03:00:37.693
WHEN WE DISCUSS THESE ITEMS

03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:42.264
THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE

03:00:42.331 --> 03:00:43.966
CERTAIN THINGS.

03:00:44.033 --> 03:00:46.769
AND IT'S NOT OFTEN CLEAR WHETHER

03:00:46.835 --> 03:00:49.838
IT'S ACCURATE SO I ASKED THE LA --

03:00:49.905 --> 03:00:51.373
TO GIVE ME SOME ESTIMATES.

03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:53.108
OF THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL

03:00:53.175 --> 03:00:55.844
YEARS THAT ARE NOW BEING SERVED

03:00:55.911 --> 03:00:57.913
TO DO ENHANCEMENTS I ALSO ASKED

03:00:57.980 --> 03:00:59.515
HIM TO GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE.

03:00:59.582 --> 03:01:01.517
OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

03:01:01.584 --> 03:01:02.651
CURRENTLY INCARCERATED.

03:01:02.718 --> 03:01:03.819
THAT.

03:01:03.886 --> 03:01:05.321
HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY ONE OR

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:07.156
MORE OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS IN AS

03:01:07.223 --> 03:01:07.389
I SAID.

03:01:07.456 --> 03:01:12.962
THERE ARE.

03:01:13.028 --> 03:01:14.196
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THEM.

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:15.331
WHICH THIS BILL DOESN'T COVER

03:01:15.397 --> 03:01:17.266
ALL BUT THEY'RE STILL ON THE

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:18.767
BOOKS HUNDRED FIFTY AND THEY

03:01:18.834 --> 03:01:21.770
RANGE SOME OF THE MAD. ONE YEAR

03:01:21.837 --> 03:01:23.572
SOME OF THEM OUT UP TO FIVE

03:01:23.639 --> 03:01:27.409
YEARS OTHERS OUT UP TO TEN YEARS.

03:01:27.476 --> 03:01:29.612
IN SOME OUTSIDE MULTI GUIDE GIVE

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:31.447
CHOICES OF A NUMBER OF YEARS

03:01:31.513 --> 03:01:32.081
ADDED.

03:01:32.147 --> 03:01:33.382
IT'S FEWER THAN ONLY ADD ONE

03:01:33.449 --> 03:01:36.085
YEAR.

03:01:36.151 --> 03:01:37.152
ANYWAY SO I ASKED THE ONLY -- TO

03:01:37.219 --> 03:01:37.886
TO GIVE ME SOME NUMBERS LIKE

03:01:37.953 --> 03:01:39.722
THAT AND I ASKED THEM WHAT WAS

03:01:39.788 --> 03:01:43.392
THE COST. TO CALIFORNIANS DUTIES.

03:01:43.459 --> 03:01:45.027
THE REASON I ASK THAT IS BECAUSE

03:01:45.094 --> 03:01:48.364
AS CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THE

03:01:48.430 --> 03:01:48.964
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON PUBLIC

03:01:49.031 --> 03:01:50.566
SAFETY.

03:01:50.633 --> 03:01:53.002
I HAVE OBSERVED THAT.

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:55.537
OVER THE YEARS EVEN THOUGH WE

03:01:55.604 --> 03:01:57.740
HAVE -- THROUGH REALIGNMENT AND

03:01:57.806 --> 03:01:59.341
OTHER THINGS.

03:01:59.408 --> 03:02:01.777
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT

03:02:01.844 --> 03:02:03.512
ARE SERVING IN OUR STATE PRISONS

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:03.812
[inaudible]

03:02:03.879 --> 03:02:05.781
OUR COST.

03:02:05.848 --> 03:02:07.683
CONTINUES TO GO UP TO THE POINT

03:02:07.750 --> 03:02:10.452
NOW THAT WE ARE SPENDING SOME

03:02:10.519 --> 03:02:12.321
THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS.

03:02:12.388 --> 03:02:15.324
ON JUST THE STATE PRISONS MORE

03:02:15.391 --> 03:02:16.625
THAN WE ARE SPENDING ON OUR

03:02:16.692 --> 03:02:18.327
HIGHER EDUCATION.

03:02:18.394 --> 03:02:20.062
AND WHEN I COMPARE IF I GIVE THE

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:22.898
EXAMPLE OF WE HAVE I'M SURE ALL

03:02:22.965 --> 03:02:24.166
OF OUR OFFICES HAVE GOTTEN

03:02:24.233 --> 03:02:26.802
LETTERS FROM THE UC SYSTEM.

03:02:26.869 --> 03:02:28.404
INDICATING THAT JUST BY IN

03:02:28.470 --> 03:02:30.906
ADDITION I BELIEVE OF I COULD BE

03:02:30.973 --> 03:02:32.141
THE IT'S EITHER FORTY MILLION OR

03:02:32.207 --> 03:02:33.609
HUNDRED MILLION I'M FORGETTING

03:02:33.676 --> 03:02:37.946
EXACTLY WHICH FIGURE WE COULD.

03:02:38.013 --> 03:02:39.548
BUY OUT THE THE TUITION

03:02:39.615 --> 03:02:41.784
INCREASES THAT THEY HAD BEEN

03:02:41.850 --> 03:02:43.952
CONSIDERING FOR MULTIPLE YEARS

03:02:44.019 --> 03:02:45.321
NOT JUST ONE YEAR.

03:02:45.387 --> 03:02:47.222
AND WE COULD GREATLY INCREASE

03:02:47.289 --> 03:02:47.723
THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIA

03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:48.857
STUDENTS.

03:02:48.924 --> 03:02:50.993
THEN PERHAPS WE WOULD AVOID

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.262
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WHAT WE'VE

03:02:53.329 --> 03:02:55.764
JUST RECENTLY SEEN WE'RE ALREADY

03:02:55.831 --> 03:02:57.433
WE HAVE AND WEALTHY CALIFORNIANS

03:02:57.499 --> 03:02:59.368
TRYING TO BUY THEIR WAY.

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:01.870
INTO OUR UC SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DO

03:03:01.937 --> 03:03:04.440
NOT HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS.

03:03:04.506 --> 03:03:05.007
ANYWAY LET ME GO BACK TO MY

03:03:05.074 --> 03:03:05.674
POINT.

03:03:05.741 --> 03:03:07.509
SO THAT FORTY TWO HUNDRED

03:03:07.576 --> 03:03:09.611
MILLION THAT'S PRETTY MINOR.

03:03:09.678 --> 03:03:13.549
AND IT'S NOW.

03:03:13.615 --> 03:03:15.417
TAKEN UP VERY MUCH BY.

03:03:15.484 --> 03:03:17.920
OUR RISING COSTS OF OUR

03:03:17.986 --> 03:03:19.621
CORRECTIONS SYSTEM SO WHAT THE

03:03:19.688 --> 03:03:20.489
LA -- GAVE ME.

03:03:20.556 --> 03:03:22.324
IS THAT.

03:03:22.391 --> 03:03:25.561
USING FIGURES FROM SEPTEMBER

03:03:25.627 --> 03:03:28.030
TWENTY SIXTEEN ABOUT 80%.

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:29.798
OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE

03:03:29.865 --> 03:03:31.333
PRISONS HAD AT LEAST ONE

03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:33.302
ENHANCEMENT.

03:03:33.369 --> 03:03:36.405
AND THAT ESTIMATE WAS THAT.

03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:36.905
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF

03:03:36.972 --> 03:03:40.776
CALIFORNIA'S PRISON POPULATION.

03:03:40.843 --> 03:03:41.777
HOW IS?

03:03:41.844 --> 03:03:43.712
IT HOUSING ENHANCEMENT COULD BE

03:03:43.779 --> 03:03:45.581
FIVE YEARS COULD BE TEN YEARS.

03:03:45.647 --> 03:03:47.216
AND THEY ESTIMATED.

03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:48.884
THAT THIS ULTIMATELY WOULD COST

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:51.854
US BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPREAD

03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:53.722
OVER YES A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT

03:03:53.789 --> 03:03:57.059
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

03:03:57.126 --> 03:04:00.195
SO I THINK THAT IT IS.

03:04:00.262 --> 03:04:02.531
PRUDENT FOR US TO LOOK AT HOW

03:04:02.598 --> 03:04:05.033
MUCH DOES HAVE SERVED US FROM A

03:04:05.100 --> 03:04:06.535
PUBLIC SAFETY POINT OF VIEW.

03:04:06.602 --> 03:04:08.470
AND I ASK THAT BECAUSE PUBLIC

03:04:08.537 --> 03:04:11.540
SAFETY IS THE LEGITIMATE LANDS

03:04:11.607 --> 03:04:12.841
FOR US TO LOOK THROUGH.

03:04:12.908 --> 03:04:15.611
CRIME IS DOWN AND HAS BEEN DOWN

03:04:15.677 --> 03:04:18.280
FOR OVER TEN YEARS VIOLENT CRIME

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:21.283
ESPECIALLY YOUTH CRIME.

03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:23.619
AND I THINK IT IS WISE FOR US TO

03:04:23.685 --> 03:04:25.854
LOOK AT WHEN WE ARE DEBATE

03:04:25.921 --> 03:04:27.823
WHETHER WE HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS

03:04:27.890 --> 03:04:30.492
FOR EXAMPLE FOR TEACHER SALARIES

03:04:30.559 --> 03:04:32.461
FOR EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION OF

03:04:32.528 --> 03:04:33.796
OUR ZERO TO FOUR YEAR OLDS.

03:04:33.862 --> 03:04:35.097
OR FOR EXPANDING OUR HIGHER

03:04:35.164 --> 03:04:38.100
EDUCATION SHOULD WE BE INSTEAD

03:04:38.167 --> 03:04:40.302
CONTINUING.

03:04:40.369 --> 03:04:42.271
SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ON CERTAIN

03:04:42.337 --> 03:04:43.772

03:04:43.839 --> 03:04:46.508
NOT REALLY SERVING US AND YET

03:04:46.575 --> 03:04:49.511
COSTING US AS ELLIE -- HAS

03:04:49.578 --> 03:04:51.747
ESTIMATED BILLIONS SO I ASKED

03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:57.733
LIFE IN PRISON -- SO THESE

03:07:57.799 --> 03:07:59.001
SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIMES ARE

03:07:59.067 --> 03:08:01.903
COVERED BY OTHER HARSHER LONGER

03:08:01.970 --> 03:08:03.739
SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS -- THIS

03:08:03.805 --> 03:08:05.474
IS NOT THE ENHANCEMENT DIE IS

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:10.979
GOING TO BE APPLIED TO THOSE

03:08:11.046 --> 03:08:12.914
KINDS OF CRIMES.

03:08:12.981 --> 03:08:14.316
THANK YOU ON MY OWN TIME MADAM

03:08:14.383 --> 03:08:15.717
PRESIDENT IS RECEIVED I'M JUST

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:17.452
ARE I JUST WAS READING THE BILL

03:08:17.519 --> 03:08:18.453
TO FIND OUT OF BECAUSE YOU KNOW

03:08:18.520 --> 03:08:19.421
REALISTICALLY IF SOMEBODY'S

03:08:19.488 --> 03:08:20.689
GOING TO GET A FIVE YEAR PRISON

03:08:20.756 --> 03:08:21.890
ENHANCEMENT AND ADDITIONAL YEAR.

03:08:21.957 --> 03:08:22.991
WOULD BE -- I DON'T KNOW I WAS

03:08:23.058 --> 03:08:23.659
CONSIDERING YOUR BILL IS WHAT I

03:08:23.725 --> 03:08:25.694
WAS DOING AND THEN I READ ALL

03:08:25.761 --> 03:08:27.062
THIS INFORMATION ON HERE BECAUSE

03:08:27.129 --> 03:08:29.197
IT'S JUST A VERY SHORT FOUR PAGE

03:08:29.264 --> 03:08:30.699
BILLER FIVE PAGE BILL.

03:08:30.766 --> 03:08:32.934
BUT THE WAY IT READS IS THAT

03:08:33.001 --> 03:08:34.736
YOUR ELIMINATING AN ADDITIONAL

03:08:34.803 --> 03:08:35.637
ONE YEAR ENHANCEMENT FOR

03:08:35.704 --> 03:08:37.372
PREVIOUS CONVICTIONS OF ALL OF

03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:39.441
THESE IDENTIFIED VIOLENT

03:08:39.508 --> 03:08:40.342
FELONIES.

03:08:40.409 --> 03:08:42.144
N. SO I MEAN IN MY MIND OF

03:08:42.210 --> 03:08:44.279
SOMEBODY RAPES REGARDLESS OF THE

03:08:44.346 --> 03:08:46.415
DIVISION OR THE THE DESCRIPTION

03:08:46.481 --> 03:08:47.916
WHICH IS DEFINED OR COMMIT

03:08:47.983 --> 03:08:50.085
SODOMY ALL OF THESE LEWD AND

03:08:50.152 --> 03:08:53.722
LASCIVIOUS ACTS -- ARSON

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:55.490
KIDNAPPING.

03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:57.392
AGAIN SPELL SO RAPE -- ALL OF

03:08:57.459 --> 03:09:00.228
THOSE THINGS IF THEY REPEAT THIS

03:09:00.295 --> 03:09:02.164
ACT I DON'T CARE IF THEY GET A

03:09:02.230 --> 03:09:03.298
TWENTY YEAR ENHANCEMENT.

03:09:03.365 --> 03:09:05.467
THEY SHOULD SERVE A PRISON TIME

03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:07.402
AND ANY ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT

03:09:07.469 --> 03:09:08.937
THAT A JUDGE COULD PROVIDE WOULD

03:09:09.004 --> 03:09:10.505
BE BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC

03:09:10.572 --> 03:09:12.607
SAFETY IN SOCIETY SO I WOULD

03:09:12.674 --> 03:09:13.875
REQUEST A NO VOTE.

03:09:13.942 --> 03:09:15.277

03:09:20.982 --> 03:09:24.186
ACTUALLY -- SHARED TO MY GOOD

03:09:24.252 --> 03:09:25.520
COLLEAGUE FROM -- BAKER FEELS

03:09:25.587 --> 03:09:28.724
CONCERN BUT I ALSO HAD A

03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:29.624
ACTUALLY CONVERSATION ONLY WITH

03:09:29.691 --> 03:09:31.159
THE AUTHOR BUT HAD MY STAFF LOOK

03:09:31.226 --> 03:09:33.595
INTO THE ISSUE AND I THINK AS

03:09:33.662 --> 03:09:35.030
HE'S EXPLAINED -- BECAUSE MY

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:36.098
CONCERN WAS THAT SOMEONE

03:09:36.164 --> 03:09:38.934
COMMITTED A VIOLENT FELONY

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.368
ANSWERS FELONY AND THEY'VE COME

03:09:40.435 --> 03:09:41.103
IN OTHER ONE THAT.

03:09:41.169 --> 03:09:43.505
PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE AT THE

03:09:43.572 --> 03:09:43.972
JUDGE'S DISCRETION AN

03:09:44.039 --> 03:09:45.307
ENHANCEMENT.

03:09:45.373 --> 03:09:46.308
AND IN FACT I THINK IS SEIZE

03:09:46.374 --> 03:09:47.542
CLEARLY STATED BOTH YOUR ON THE

03:09:47.609 --> 03:09:50.479
FLOOR AND CERTAINLY -- WE SEEN

03:09:50.545 --> 03:09:51.446
ALSO IN MY STAFF'S OWN

03:09:51.513 --> 03:09:53.281
EXAMINATION THAT ACTUALLY THERE

03:09:53.348 --> 03:09:54.816
ARE OTHER -- SHE MORE SEVERE

03:09:54.883 --> 03:09:56.485
ENHANCEMENTS AND IN FACT THIS

03:09:56.551 --> 03:09:59.254
PARTICULAR HAND SMIT CANNOT BE

03:09:59.321 --> 03:10:00.589
EMPLOYED.

03:10:00.655 --> 03:10:01.790
IF THOSE OTHER ENHANCEMENTS ARE

03:10:01.857 --> 03:10:03.358
USED SO I THINK -- FOR THAT

03:10:03.425 --> 03:10:04.626
REASON.

03:10:04.693 --> 03:10:05.994
I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WHAT

03:10:06.061 --> 03:10:11.767
DOES NOT ALLOW CRIMINALS WHO --

03:10:11.833 --> 03:10:13.335
GAUGING SERIOUS VIOLENT FELONIES

03:10:13.401 --> 03:10:15.871
TO ACTUALLY GET A NECESSARILY A

03:10:15.937 --> 03:10:18.440
LESSER SENTENCE TO AND THEREFORE

03:10:18.507 --> 03:10:20.876
I SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION THANK

03:10:20.942 --> 03:10:22.711

03:10:30.552 --> 03:10:32.320
OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS THAT.

03:10:32.387 --> 03:10:33.989
SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS ARE TOUGH

03:10:34.055 --> 03:10:35.891
ON CRIME MEASURES HAVE NOT

03:10:35.957 --> 03:10:38.093
SUCCEEDED AT ALL ALL WE'VE DONE

03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:40.362
IS OVER POPULATE OUR PRISONS AND

03:10:40.428 --> 03:10:42.864
COST AGAIN THE TAXPAYERS MORE

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:43.098
MONEY.

03:10:43.165 --> 03:10:45.066

IT WAS PROPOSED.

03:27:34.375 --> 03:27:35.843
LAST MINUTE IN PUBLIC SAFETY SO

03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:37.077

03:28:05.840 --> 03:28:07.341
I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE

03:28:07.408 --> 03:28:09.043
CONTINUE TO HEAR WORDS SPOKEN ON

03:28:09.109 --> 03:28:11.312
THIS FLOOR THAT CONTINUES TO

03:28:11.378 --> 03:28:15.349
DENY.

03:28:15.416 --> 03:28:16.350
THAT WE HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL

03:28:16.417 --> 03:28:18.018

03:28:31.799 --> 03:28:35.836
BROWN EQUALLY.

03:28:35.903 --> 03:28:36.971
THE NOTION OF TRUST.

03:28:37.037 --> 03:28:38.839

BECAUSE I DO FUNDAMENTALLY

03:28:44.678 --> 03:28:46.714
BELIEVE THAT TRAINING IS

03:28:46.780 --> 03:28:48.015
NECESSARY TO CREATE CULTURE

03:28:48.082 --> 03:28:50.384

03:29:07.501 --> 03:29:09.036
THE POPULATION.

03:29:09.103 --> 03:29:11.405
AND THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE
