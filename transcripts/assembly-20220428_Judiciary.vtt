THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.983
WE BELIEVE THAT THE ATTORNEY

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:39.318

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:55.501
ESSENTIAL TO GETTING COSTS UNDER

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:58.303
CONTROL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT

00:18:58.370 --> 00:18:59.304
HIGH PRICES FOR HEALTH CARE

00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:01.373

IS NOT JUST HEALTHCARE BILL IT

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:25.063

AVAILABLE IN THOSE AREAS. VERY

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:34.486
CONCERNED THAT THE PROVISIONS OF

00:22:34.553 --> 00:22:36.888
THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THAT HARDER

00:22:36.955 --> 00:22:39.157

VERY SPECIFICALLY TO- THE

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.562
EXPANDED AUTHORITY OF THE

00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:50.335
BUT OHER SECTORS- UP OF THE

00:22:50.402 --> 00:22:52.704
HEALTHCARE FIELD. I CONCERNS

00:22:52.771 --> 00:22:55.774
THAT THERE ARE NOT DUE PROCESS

00:22:55.841 --> 00:23:00.245
PROTECTIONS- THE BILL PROVIDES

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:02.214
FOR A PUBLIC HEARING VERY MUCH

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.249
LIKE THIS ONE WITH THERE IS

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:05.751
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND PUBLIC

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:09.654
TESTIMONY. BUT IT'S NOT- HEARING

00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:11.022
ON THE EVIDENCE THAT'S NOT THE

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:13.658
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE THE

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:18.029
ABILITY TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE-

00:23:18.096 --> 00:23:20.031
REGULATOR MAKES A DECISION TO

RESPOND TO EVIDENCE TO PROVIDE

00:23:21.833 --> 00:23:24.002
COUNTERVAILING EVIDENCE- IT'S A

DISCRETION- TWO ONE INDIVIDUAL.

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.743
AND WE BELIEVE THAT VIOLATES DUE

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:36.548
PROCESS- IT MAKES IT MORE

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:39.050
DIFFICULT TO RESPOND TO A

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:41.052
CHANGING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT

00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:43.455
WHEN THERE IS NOT CERTAINTY. IN

00:23:43.522 --> 00:23:45.123
WHAT THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.092
AND WHAT KIND OF CONDITIONS ARE

00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:49.494
GOING TO COME OUT. SO NOT ONLY

00:23:49.561 --> 00:23:52.330
IS THERE THE TIMELINE HAS THIS

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:53.532
BEEN REFERENCED BY THE

SUPPORTERS OF NINETY DAYS THOSE

THE REGULATOR REQUESTS MORE TIME

IN THE PARTICIPANT OF COURSE

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:03.275
AGREES TO EXTENDING MORE TIME

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:04.943
BECAUSE TO SAY NO WOULD MEAN

THAT THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH

WITH ALTHOUGH IT'S TECHNICALLY

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:23.800
OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THIS

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:25.269
COMMITTEE SO WE'RE TRYING TO

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:27.537
FIGURE OUT REALLY WHAT THE BEST

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.606
WAY TO DO IT IS ARE THE M. HSA

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:31.608
FUNDS. INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT HAS

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.543

MIGHT INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT

00:48:37.514 --> 00:48:39.016
REALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:46.890
TALKING ABOUT DO WE BECAUSE

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:49.026
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. ACCESSING

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.794
THESE THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS

00:48:50.861 --> 00:48:53.397
AND SORT OF IN AND OUT AND IN

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:54.097
AND OUT A LOT THEY'RE NOT

00:48:54.164 --> 00:48:56.767
GETTING US FOR THE HELP THAT

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:57.768
THEY NEED. THAT'S PART OF WHY

00:48:57.834 --> 00:49:00.137
THEY'RE IN AND OUT. OF THIS THE

00:49:00.203 --> 00:49:00.737
PROGRAMS BUT GOING TO

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:02.072
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT. WHICH HAS

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.440
BEEN DEMONSTRATED IS NOT

00:49:03.507 --> 00:49:05.609
EFFECTIVE AND CAN OFTENTIMES

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:08.545
EXACERBATE THE CONDITION THE

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:09.546
MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.181
THESE PEOPLE FACE. IS A PART

00:49:11.248 --> 00:49:13.216
THAT I REALLY STRUGGLE WITH AND

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:15.652
EXTENDING M. HSA FUNDS TO

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:17.120
INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT WHICH IS

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:19.089
CLEARLY WHAT IS NOT DESIGNED TO

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:20.924
DO AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:22.326
DOES. IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:23.293
DEFINITELY STRUGGLE WITH IT IS

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.928
TECHNICALLY A QUESTION NOW FOR

00:49:24.995 --> 00:49:27.097
APPROACH TO DEAL WITH IT WAS

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.598
SOMETHING THAT HEALTH COMMITTEE.

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.100
REALLY DIDN'T. I DIDN'T ADDRESS

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:31.902
AN APPROPRIATE WAY IT'S NOT

00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:33.236
SOMETHING WITH TECHNICALLY

00:49:33.303 --> 00:49:34.538
WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION I'M JUST

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:35.906
RAISING THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.407
IS SOMETHING THAT GIVES ME SOME

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.509
HARPER AND THAT'S- THE HEART OF

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:41.545
A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION. THAT

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:44.014
BEING SAID I THINK FOR ME THIS

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:47.784
BILL. IS FINE TO PASS OUT OF

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.920
THIS COMMITTEE. THE EVEN GIVEN

00:49:49.986 --> 00:49:51.755
THAT PARTICULAR CHALLENGE AND

00:49:51.822 --> 00:49:52.723
I'M HOPING THAT THE

00:49:52.789 --> 00:49:55.025
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE WHICH-IS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO TAKE

00:49:55.092 --> 00:49:57.728
A LOOK AT HOW FUNDS OUT OF

00:49:57.794 --> 00:49:59.563
IMAGES THEY ARE OR ARE NOT BEING

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.565
SPENT. WE'LL TAKE TAKE A SERIOUS

LOOK AT IT SAID THIS IS. THAT'S

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.602
MY CONCERN WITH THIS THAT THAT'S

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:07.270
MY CHALLENGE FOR THIS ALTHOUGH I

00:50:07.337 --> 00:50:08.071
THINK AND WE'VE WORKED THROUGH

00:50:08.138 --> 00:50:10.107

CONVERSATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.749
POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO PEOPLE'S

00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:20.784
CIVIL LIBERTIES THAT'S THE MAIN

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:23.019
CORE OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE IS

GOING TO BE IS GOING TO BE

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.657

MY OWN COUNTY MY LAW PRACTICE.

00:50:56.486 --> 00:50:59.356
WHEN YOU SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE

CYCLING IN OUR SYSTEM- THAT IN

00:51:02.359 --> 00:51:04.127

THEY GO BACK THEY GET RELEASED

00:51:05.595 --> 00:51:09.433

THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEY ARE IN

00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.775
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN. IN MY LAW

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:21.144
PRACTICE. WHICH IN THE WORST

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:22.646
CASE SCENARIO THEY GET RELEASED

00:51:22.712 --> 00:51:24.548
TO WHEREVER THEY WERE. AND THEY

00:51:24.614 --> 00:51:26.416
DON'T END UP BACK IN THE SYSTEM

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:27.884
UNTIL. THEY COMMIT A CRIME. AND

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:28.885
THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:30.520
HOW TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION

00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.222
WHICH IS REALLY AT ITS CORE IN A

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.257
LOT OF THESE CASES A MENTAL

00:51:34.324 --> 00:51:35.358
HEALTH PROBLEM. A SCHIZOPHRENIC

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:36.193
THAT'S OFF THE MEDICATION WHAT

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:39.629
HAVE YOU- IN. THE CONTEXT OF THE

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:41.198
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:44.468
IS- SHALL WE SAY COULD USE

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:45.535
IMPROVEMENT AND HOW IT HANDLES

00:51:45.602 --> 00:51:47.771
THESE CASES. TO PUT IT MILDLY-

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:50.907
SO THE CYCLING'S RAIL AND- IF I

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:51.942
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE BILLS TRY

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:54.277
TO CORRECTLY YOU WANT TO MAKE IT

00:51:54.344 --> 00:51:55.912
SO THAT WHEN THEY GET RELEASED.

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:57.380
THERE'S SOME SORT OF TREATMENT

00:51:57.447 --> 00:51:58.548
PLAN DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT

00:51:58.615 --> 00:52:00.183
CORRECT AND I AND I GET THE

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:02.719
BURDENS ON THAT AND I GET THIS

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.621
COULD BE DONE A TIGHT TIMELINE

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:05.622
ALL THAT. BUT THEY ARE COMMONLY

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.123
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AT LEAST IN

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.825
SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY THEY'RE

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:09.926
NOT RELEASE WITH ANY KIND BUT

00:52:09.993 --> 00:52:13.396
ALL. DIRT GIVEN WHATEVER MINIMAL

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:14.998
TREATMENT THEY THEY- IS DEEMED

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:15.966
APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:17.534
CIRCUMSTANCE DURING THE WHOLE.

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.002
AND THEN THEY'RE SENT BACK TO

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:20.203
THEIR FAMILIES ARE SENT BACK TO

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.239
WORK. TO THE STREETS ARE SENT

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:25.108
BACK TO THE ENCAMPMENTS. AND-

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.910
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SO MANY

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.345
PEOPLE I THINK CYCLING. IN AND

00:52:28.411 --> 00:52:30.881
OUT SO I AM IN SUPPORT THE BILL

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:33.083
THE DAY. THAT I. IN THE MENTAL

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:35.051
HEALTH SERVICES ACT PAYMENT

00:52:35.118 --> 00:52:37.087
THING IS ABOVE MY PAY GRADE ALL

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:38.154
THE PROBES FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.123
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STAFF ON

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.725
ME AT LEAST OF THERE'S A PLAN

00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:42.859
THERE'S SOMETHING. THAT I MEAN

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:45.128
IF NOTHING ELSE A FAMILY MEMBER.

WHOLE CONVERSATION FOR AN HOUR

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.811
WAS ON THIS TOPIC- AND I THINK

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:49.212
WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH WHAT WE DO

00:55:49.279 --> 00:55:51.014

STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING. AND

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:08.198
SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO

00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:09.599
CONTINUE TO BRING FORTH IDEAS TO

00:56:09.666 --> 00:56:10.767

YOU MAY CLOSER AND LOOK THIS IS

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.552
A HEALTHY DEBATE THAT I THINK

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:30.553
YOU KNOW THE CONVERSATION ABOUT-

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:31.955
AND ACCESS AND HOW WE GET THIS

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:34.824
WRONG RIGHT AT THE M. H. S. A.

00:56:34.891 --> 00:56:36.993
DOLLARS NOW SAVE A FIVE PER

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.962
SECOND HOW YOU MAY FEEL ABOUT

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:39.562
THE DEBATE ON THAT PARTICULAR

00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:47.904
PIECE OF DOLLARS. BUT IT IS THE

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:48.905
LEGISLATIVE PROGNOSTICATORS FOR

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:51.007
THAT THAT THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.275
DEBATE AND WE PROBABLY SHOULD

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:53.176
HAVE THAT DEBATE THE REASON WE

00:56:53.243 --> 00:56:54.978
ARGUED AT THE TIME I'M GONNA GO

00:56:55.044 --> 00:56:56.946
BY MEMORY SO IF SOMEBODY SAYS

00:56:57.013 --> 00:56:58.648
I'M ABOUT A COUPLE OF DOLLARS

00:56:58.715 --> 00:56:59.449
OFF- I'M HAPPY TO CORRECTED

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.984
ONLINE BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.553
WHEN WE ASK FOR THE AUDIT WE ARE

00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:04.788
NOT EXPECTING TO FIND CERTAIN

00:57:04.854 --> 00:57:05.989
THINGS. THAT WE DID DURING THAT

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:08.258
TIME IN AT THE TIME WE FOUND

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:10.527
THAT L. A. COUNTY HAD CLOSE TO A

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.294
BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FUNDS NOW

00:57:11.361 --> 00:57:12.996
WHEN THEY'RE AT THE TIME WAS I

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.598
THINK A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE

00:57:15.665 --> 00:57:16.633
HUNDRED SIXTY SIX THOUSAND

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.768
PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS- IN

00:57:18.835 --> 00:57:20.036
CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT WAS

00:57:20.103 --> 00:57:21.871
SIXTY THREE OR SIXTY FIVE THE

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:23.973
TIME AGAIN I SAID I'M FUDGING

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:24.874
THE NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.109
I REMEMBER EXACTLY BUT WHEN YOU

00:57:26.176 --> 00:57:28.244
TAKE A LOOK AT NUMBERS LIKE THAT

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.546
PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREETS AND

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:30.947
YOU SEE. CLOSE TO A BILLION

00:57:31.014 --> 00:57:32.248
DOLLARS- IN A BANK ACCOUNT YEAH

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:34.017
IT'S TIME TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:57:34.083 --> 00:57:36.252
THOSE DOLLARS IN USE IN A LITTLE

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.287
BIT DIFFERENTLY THAT'S OUR

00:57:37.353 --> 00:57:38.888
PRODUCT THAT WE SHOULD DO SO BUT

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.290
BUT I THINK IT'LL I THINK IT'S

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:41.958
BEEN SAID IT AT ONE OF OUR

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:43.860
COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY SAID

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:44.828
INSTEAD OF TOLD NOT WORKING I

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.196
DON'T KNOW ANYBODY'S GONNA ARGUE

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.997
THAT THAT WHAT THAT THE WORK

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:48.431
THAT WE'RE DOING ON

00:57:48.498 --> 00:57:50.767
HOMELESSNESS. IS AS EFFECTIVE IS

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:51.434
IT SHOULD BE DAHLE ELEMENTS OF

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:52.836
IT THAT WORK VERY WELL OTHER

00:57:52.902 --> 00:57:54.170
ELEMENTS THAT WE NEED REVIEWS IT

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.104
DO DIFFERENTLY AND THEN THERE

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:57.140
ARE ELEMENTS OF IT IT JUST

00:57:57.207 --> 00:57:58.708
BROKEN I MEAN WE'VE WE'VE

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.043
CREATED A VERY GOOD PROGRAMS BUT

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.877
WE ALSO CREATED BUREAUCRATIC

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.045
PROCESS OF THE NIGHTMARES THAT

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.413
HAVE RESULTED IN RESULTS FOR

00:58:03.479 --> 00:58:04.180
THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:06.649
THE DEBATE IS NOT ABOUT CIVIL

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:10.854
LIBERTIES. IT'S NOT. MUCH ANY

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.455
OF. LAWS I'D LIKE TO STEP INTO

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:14.257
SOME THOSE CASES IN CERTAIN.

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.291
CASES I WOULD. BUT THE BUT THE

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:16.860
BIG TODAY IS ABOUT. CREATE A

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.161
VERY SIMPLE COORDINATED PLAN AT

00:58:18.228 --> 00:58:20.463
THE STATE LEVEL. A VERY SIMPLE

00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:21.231
COORDINATED PLAN OF THE COUNTY.

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:22.966
N. REPORTING MECHANISM BECAUSE

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:24.968
IT NO REPORTING IS DONE ON THIS.

00:58:25.034 --> 00:58:28.137
THAT THAT SATISFIES- OUR QUEST

00:58:28.204 --> 00:58:29.906
FOR DATA TO CHANGE THE LARGER

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:31.841
CONVERSATION AND LAWS. AND YES

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:34.677
THE DEBATE IS ABOUT USING THESE

00:58:34.744 --> 00:58:36.880
DOLLARS DIFFERENTLY- WHEN WE

00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:39.315
TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK WE

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:41.584
BEGAN TO TALK TO SOME OF THE

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:42.652
SUBCOMMITTEES BUT THE TAKE A

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:43.786
LOOK AT HOW MUCH OF THESE

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:44.921
DOLLARS. ARE REALLY BEING HELD

00:58:44.988 --> 00:58:46.990
IN FROM THESE ACCOUNTS. AND YOU

00:58:47.056 --> 00:58:48.391
HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS IT GOOD

00:58:48.458 --> 00:58:50.760
USE. OF THOSE DOLLARS TO BE HELD

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:51.361
IN THOSE ACCOUNTS WHEN PEOPLE

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.829
ARE SUFFERING ON THE STREETS.

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.264
THE LPS LAWS THAT WERE SET IN

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.432
PLACE I SUPPORT FOR VERY GOOD

00:58:56.499 --> 00:58:57.600
REASONS BECAUSE SERVICE APPLAUSE

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:58.301
OR SOME PLACE I SUPPORT VERY

00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.603
GOOD REASONS BUT THERE ARE

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.871
DIFFERENT PLACES AND SPACES.

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:04.140
WHAT WE HAVE TO I WOULD ARGUE WE

00:59:04.207 --> 00:59:06.776
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MAYBE

00:59:06.843 --> 00:59:07.877
IT NEEDS TO CHANGE THAT'S NOT

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:09.279
WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY BUT JUST

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:10.813
BECAUSE PEOPLE BROUGHT UP ALL

00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.416
FATE. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT A

00:59:13.483 --> 00:59:14.517
PERSON WHO WAS HURT ON THE

00:59:14.584 --> 00:59:15.885
STREETS. WE TAKE A LOOK AT A

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.120
PERSON WAS A DANGER TO

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.121
THEMSELVES OR DANGER TO OTHERS.

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:21.057
WE TAKE A LOOK AT A PERSON. WHO

00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.492
IS. PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.127
N. AND MENTAL ANGUISH ON THE
