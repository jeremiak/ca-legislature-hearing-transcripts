00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:44.816
AWAY EXCESS CHOICE SO THERE'S

00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.885
MORE ROOM FOR JUST. NINETY I

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:48.119
HAD TO TAKE A LOAN TO COVER THE

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.754
COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL CLEANING

00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:51.923
AND TO ENSURE I CAN DISINFECT

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:53.591
AT STAKE THE NATURAL PRODUCTS.

00:29:53.658 --> 00:29:54.826
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A CONSTANT

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.828
WORRY OF EXPOSURE. AS MANY

00:29:56.895 --> 00:29:57.962
PROVIDERS HAVE EXPERIENCED NOT

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.631
ALL PARENTS QUARANTINE THEIR

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:01.099
CHILDREN WHO HAVE COME IN CLOSE

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.500
CONTACT WITH COLD. AND WHEN

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:03.902
PROVIDERS HAVE TO SHUT DOWN TO

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.336
QUARANTINE MANY OF US DO NOT

00:30:05.403 --> 00:30:07.572
GET PAID. BECAUSE PARENTS ARE

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:09.340
RESOURCE AND AGENCIES SWITCH

00:30:09.407 --> 00:30:11.342
PROVIDERS WHEN THEY ARE

00:30:11.409 --> 00:30:12.744

NOT PAYING THE PROVIDER WHO HAD

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.383
TO QUARANTINE. PARENTS ARE ALSO

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.717
BY PASSING THE NECESSARY

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.519

THE PANDEMIC HOWEVER SINCE

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.353
MARCH TWENTY TWENTY UNTOLD

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:29.621
NUMBERS OF CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:31:29.687 --> 00:31:31.489
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE PERMANENTLY

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:33.791
SHUT THEIR DOORS. OPERATING

00:31:33.858 --> 00:31:35.326
UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS IS

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:36.995
CHALLENGING FOR ALL BUT

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:39.030
IMPOSSIBLE FOR MANY SO OTHERS

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:41.899
WILL SURELY FOLLOW. SUPPORTING

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.401
PUBLIC HEALTH IS EVERYONE'S

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:45.336
COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:47.405
CHILD CARE CENTERS HAVE SHOWN

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:48.006
THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR PART

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:50.308
SUCCESSFULLY. CALIFORNIA IS

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.810
FACING A CHILD CARE CAPACITY

00:31:52.877 --> 00:31:54.746
AND INFRASTRUCTURE CRISIS.

00:31:54.812 --> 00:31:56.681
WHICH HAS NOT EVEN BEEN FULLY

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:58.883
REALIZED IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.685
ACT AND THERE STEPS THE STATE

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:02.387
CAN TAKE TO HELP CONTAIN THE

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:05.023
CRISIS. SO WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA

00:32:05.089 --> 00:32:07.358
DO. I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON JUST

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:09.427
ONE THING THE ONE THING THAT

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:11.462
MAY VERY WELL HAVE THE GREATEST

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:15.033
POSITIVE IMPACT. THE ISSUE IS

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:17.135
COHORT SIZE. WE ALL AGREE THAT

00:32:17.201 --> 00:32:19.037
MAINTAINING STABLE GROUPS THAT

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.905
ARE SMALL AS POSSIBLE IS

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.440
IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF

00:32:22.507 --> 00:32:25.076
INFECTION AND LIMIT POTENTIAL

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:27.578
EXPOSURE. HOWEVER ACCORDING HAS

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:30.014
A CORRESPONDING. OF LIMITING

00:32:30.081 --> 00:32:31.616
THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN A CHILD

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:33.117
CARE CENTER CAN AND ROLL

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:36.120
THEREBY CONSTRAINING ROBIN.

00:32:36.187 --> 00:32:37.488
SINCE MOST CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.691
OPERATE UNDER THIN MARGINS

00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:41.326
CAPPING ENROLLMENT MEANS

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:43.795
CENTERS CAN AT BEST BREAK EVEN.

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:45.296
MORE TYPICALLY THEY'RE

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:47.065
OPERATING AT A LOSS AND USING

00:32:47.131 --> 00:32:48.499
PERSONAL RESOURCES TO COVER THE

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:50.635
DIFFERENCE. THIS CAN ONLY

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:52.870
CONTINUE FOR SO LONG BEFORE A

00:32:52.937 --> 00:32:54.605
CHILD CARE CENTERS FORCED TO

00:32:54.672 --> 00:32:57.108
CLOSE ITS DOORS. WITH

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.076
ENROLLMENT LIMITED AT

00:32:58.142 --> 00:33:00.011
INDIVIDUAL CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.013
THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.616
CHILD CARE CAPACITY IS REDUCED.

00:33:05.683 --> 00:33:07.185
AS WE HOPEFULLY EMERGE FROM

00:33:07.251 --> 00:33:08.686
PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:11.489
MODE THIS YEAR IT'S CRITICAL TO

00:33:11.556 --> 00:33:13.358
RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:33:13.424 --> 00:33:15.259
COAL COURT LIMITS ON CHILD CARE

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:17.595
CAPACITY. IT CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.731
MUST LIMIT ENROLLMENT WORTH

00:33:19.797 --> 00:33:21.366
THEY NO LONGER OFFER IN ROOM

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:22.900
UNTIL BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:24.869
EXIST. FAMILIES WILL HAVE A

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:26.771
HARD TIME GOING BACK TO WORK

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.272
WHICH WILL CONSEQUENTLY PUT A

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.208
DRAG ON CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY

00:33:30.274 --> 00:33:32.543
FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. ON THE

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.113
SUBJECT OF CO HOARDING THE LAST

00:33:35.179 --> 00:33:37.982
pOF SOCIAL SERVICES IN

00:33:38.049 --> 00:33:39.484
COLLABORATION WITH THE

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.418
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:42.720
EDUCATION. ISSUED GUIDANCE FOR

00:33:42.787 --> 00:33:43.688
CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:46.057
PROVIDERS WAS ON JULY

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.059
SEVENTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY.

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.527
WHILE THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:51.629
JULY FOUR MONTHS AFTERTHE

00:33:51.696 --> 00:33:53.798
START OF THE PANDEMIC MAY HAVE

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:55.466
BEEN APPROPRIATE AT THE TIME.

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.068
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ITS

00:33:57.135 --> 00:33:59.337
ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO PROVIDE

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:01.439
GUIDANCE FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:34:01.506 --> 00:34:03.775
SCHOOLS TO FOLLOW WHEN STUDENTS

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:06.043
MEET FOR TARGETED SUPPORT AND

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.212
INTERVENTION SERVICES WHILE THE

00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.782
SCHOOL IS CLOSED TO IN PERSON

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:13.785
INSTRUCTION. FOR REASONS THAT

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.586
ARE NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR CHILD

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.321
CARE CENTERS WERE INCLUDED IN

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:18.990
THIS CATEGORY EVEN THOUGH THE

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:20.458
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:22.727
SERVICES STRICTLY REGULATES

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:24.595
CHILD CARE CENTERS AND

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.364
DETERMINES CHILD CARE CAPACITY

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:28.166
BASED ON THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:31.035
CLASSROOMS. INTERESTINGLY THE

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:32.470
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL

00:34:32.537 --> 00:34:34.372
SERVICES REQUIRES MINIMUM

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.607
INDOOR SQUARE FOOTAGE IN CHILD

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:37.942
CARE CENTERS AT THIRTY FIVE PER

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:41.345
CHILD. IF YOU DO THE MATH THE

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.681
MINIMUM SQUARE FOOTAGE REQUIRED

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.116
TO MAINTAIN SIX FOOT FOR

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:48.019
PHYSICAL DISTANCE IS A BIT LESS

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:50.221
THAN THIRTY PER INDIVIDUAL. THE

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:52.089
POINT IS THIS CHILD CARE

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:53.658
CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:34:53.724 --> 00:34:55.526
ALREADY LICENSED TO ENSURE

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:57.762
PHYSICAL DISTANCING FOR UP TO

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.630
THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:34:59.697 --> 00:35:01.699
THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ENROLL. BUT

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.868
CHILD CARE CENTERS ARE AT YET

00:35:03.935 --> 00:35:06.204
ANOTHER DISADVANTAGE. UNDER

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.271
CALIFORNIA'S RE OPENING

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:08.906
FRAMEWORK FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:11.742
SCHOOLS ONCE THE SCHOOL IS OPEN

00:35:11.809 --> 00:35:14.512
THE COHORT SIZE IS UNSPECIFIED.

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.813
MEANING THE NUMBER OF GROUP

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.049
MEMBERS CAN VARY BASED ON THE

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:19.417
SIZE OF THE PHYSICAL SPACE

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.186
PROBE PROVIDED MEMBERSHIP IS

00:35:22.253 --> 00:35:24.222
FIXED AND STABLE. THERE IS NO

00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:25.957
SUCH CONSIDERATION FOR CHILD

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:27.892
CARE CENTERS WHICH POSES

00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:30.394
SERIOUS SHORT TERM CONSEQUENCES

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:31.262
TO THE VIABILITY OF CHILD CARE

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.264
CENTERS THE SUCCESSFUL RE

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:35.500
OPENING OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.034
AND THE LONG TERM STATE OF

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:40.171
CHILD CARE CAPACITY AND

00:35:40.238 --> 00:35:41.806
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.641
SO HERE'S THE KEY TAKEAWAY.

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.810
REGARDLESS OF THE RATIONALE FOR

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:47.311
PUTTING GREATER OPERATING

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.946
RESTRICTIONS ON CHILD CARE

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:52.116
CENTERS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:53.818
K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS.

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.887
CONTINUING WITH THIS APPROACH

00:35:55.953 --> 00:35:57.688
WILL HAVE DEVASTATING LONG TERM

00:35:57.755 --> 00:36:00.491
CONSEQUENCES THE CHILD CARE

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:02.193
CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.061
TITLE TWENTY TWO REGULATIONS

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:05.463
ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:07.665
ENSURE COHORT SIZES ARE KEPT AS

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:09.767
SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND PROVIDES

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.569
CHILD CARE CENTERS WITH THE

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.371
SAME IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY THAT

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:15.573
K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS HAVE

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.642
TO OPERATE SAFELY. THANK YOU

GREAT DEAL ABOUT THEIR CLOSELY

RELATED CHALLENGES AND I LIKE

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:30.915
TO SHARE SOME OF THE KEY

00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.650
FINDINGS WITH YOU. IN PART TO

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.518
SHOW THAT THE EXPERIENCES THAT

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.820
HAVE BEEN SHARED TODAY BY

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.355
PROVIDERS AND PARENTS ARE

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:40.558
EMBLEMATIC OF CHALLENGES THAT

00:37:40.625 --> 00:37:43.127
ARE WIDESPREAD. TO PROVIDE SOME

00:37:43.194 --> 00:37:45.896
CONTEXT ABOUT THE SURVEY. 74%

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:47.398
OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS WORKED AT

00:37:47.465 --> 00:37:49.734
LICENSED CHILD CARE CENTERS AND

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.369
26% WORKED AT LICENSEDFAMILY

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:54.972
CHILD CARE HOMES. WHERE CARE IS

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:55.539
PROVIDED IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S

00:37:58.643 --> 00:38:00.244
SOME FORM OF STATE AND OR

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:01.846
FEDERAL FUNDING. AND A LITTLE

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.247
OVER HALF PROVIDE EITHER

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.949

A LITTLE OVER 85% OF SURVEY

00:38:16.327 --> 00:38:18.195
RESPONDENTS WERE PEOPLE OF

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:20.197
COLOR. THIS IS UNSURPRISING

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.699
GIVEN THAT WOMEN OF COLOR MAKE

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:23.534
UP THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA'S

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.336
CHILD CARE WORKFORCE AND THEY

00:38:25.403 --> 00:38:28.205
HAVE DEEPLY FELT THE IMPACTS OF

00:38:28.272 --> 00:38:31.108
THE KOBE NINETEEN CAN DAMAGE.

00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:32.309
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:34.578
THEIR PROGRAMS WERE FACING LOW

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:35.413
ENROLLMENT WAS THE MOST

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.848
FREQUENTLY CITED CHALLENGE. OF

00:38:48.959 --> 00:38:50.928
64% OF THESE PROVIDERS WERE

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.530
CENTERS. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:54.098
LOWER ENROLLMENT HAS MEANT LESS

00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:55.332

BETWEEN THEIR MONTHLY COSTS AND

THEIR REVENUE OR REIMBURSEMENT.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.018
IT'S WORRISOME BUT PERHAPS

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:15.052
UNSURPRISING THAT MANY

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.387
PROVIDERS HAVE CLOSED

SUBSIDIES. SOME PROVIDERS

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.421
INITIALLY HAD TO CLOSE

WHAT COSTS THEY WERE MOST

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:11.976
WORRIED ABOUT BEING ABLE TO

AMONG BOTH CENTERS AND FAMILY

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:19.383
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WERE

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.785

AS A TOP CHALLENGE. NOW WE KNOW

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.163
THAT MANY PROVIDERS RECEIVE

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:33.664
CLEANING SUPPLIES IN PP FROM

SHOWN A LIGHT ON. ALL OF THE

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.417
HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE BY

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:43.120
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS AND WE ARE

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.922
ALL INDEBTED TO THEM FOR THE

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:48.625
RISKS THEY TAKE AND THE AND THE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.860
ROAD WORK THAT THEY HAVE DONE.

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:53.764
AS OF. AS OR MY OR- THE CHILD

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:54.932
RESOURCE CENTER IN A NON

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:56.867
ORGANIZATION WE SEARCH SERVE A

00:43:56.934 --> 00:43:58.635
LARGE- SERVICE AREA IN LOS

00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:00.037
ANGELES AND SAN BERNARDINO

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:01.839
COUNTY. AND WE OUR SISTER

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.941
AGENCY TO SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS

00:44:04.008 --> 00:44:06.143
ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA AND I

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.544
WANT TO TALK TO DO A LITTLE BIT

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:09.780
ABOUT THE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED.

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.348
WHAT IS NEEDED AND WHAT HAS

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:13.417
BEEN WORKING AND WHAT WE NEED

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.152
TO DO GOING FORWARD TO HELP OUR

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.588
CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:19.690
OUR PROVIDERS RECOVER. SO I

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:22.693
THINK THE LESSON THAT THE WORLD

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.728
LEARNS OUR COMMUNITIES LEARNED

00:44:24.795 --> 00:44:26.730
WAS ONE THAT WE ALREADY KNEW

00:44:26.797 --> 00:44:28.999
CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL. AND IT

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.801
IS ESSENTIAL FOR OUR FAMILIES

00:44:30.868 --> 00:44:33.437
TO BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND IT

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.572
WAS APPARENT IN THE VERY EARLY

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.508
HOURS OF THE PANDEMIC THAT THAT

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:39.376
ONE IS CRITICAL FOR OUR

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:41.545
ESSENTIAL WORKERS. WHAT WE ALSO

00:44:41.612 --> 00:44:42.479
LEARNED AS MANY OF OUR

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:44.415
ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE NOT VERY

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:46.650
HIGHLY PAID AND MANY OF THEM

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:48.585
ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A CHILD

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:50.521
CARE SUBSIDY BUT THERE AREN'T

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.955
ENOUGH SUBSIDIES TO GO AROUND

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:55.192
BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM ONLY SERVES

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.994
ONE IN NINE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN-

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:59.163
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT. OUR LOCAL

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:02.166
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE BUT

00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:05.369
NOT WELL RESOURCE AND IT WORKED

00:45:05.436 --> 00:45:07.237
VERY QUICKLY TO RESPOND TO THE

00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:09.139
PANDEMIC AND I WILL TALK ABOUT

00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:11.075
SOME OF WHAT WAS DONE. BUT

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:13.243
THERE'S MORE TO DO AND THE

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:15.345
CRITICAL NEED TO HAVE THAT

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.847
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:18.749
TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS. AND

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:22.186
SUPPORT THE FAMILIES IS IT IS

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:24.054
NECESSARY FOR US TO GET THROUGH

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:26.757
THE REST OF THE PANDEMIC AND

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:29.460
ALSO AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SO OUR

00:45:29.526 --> 00:45:30.828
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY

00:45:30.894 --> 00:45:32.563
RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY TO THE

00:45:32.629 --> 00:45:35.899
PANDEMIC- ARE PROGRAMS WHICH

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:38.001
ARE LARGELY HOUSED IN COMMUNITY

00:45:38.068 --> 00:45:41.004
BASED ORGANIZATIONS OR- LOCAL

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:43.307
EDUCATION AGENCIES WORKED

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:45.876
QUICKLY WITH OUR LOCAL FIRST

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:46.643
FIVE COMMISSIONS AND LOCAL

GOVERNMENT. TO TRY TO GET

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:51.615
RESOURCES OUT TO PROVIDERS.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:52.916
WE'VE WORKED THROUGH OUR STATE

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:55.252
ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM TO

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:57.421

WORKER VOUCHERS FOR THOUSANDS

TO RECEIVE CHILD CARE SERVICES

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:13.070
AND WE ALSO WORKED TO PROVIDE

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.505
REFERRALS TO HELP THEM FIND

00:46:14.571 --> 00:46:17.040
CHILD CARE AS MANY PROVIDERS

00:46:17.107 --> 00:46:19.076
WERE CLOSED AS HAS BEEN ALREADY

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.211
STATED. OUR RESOURCE AND

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:23.514
REFERRAL PROGRAM WORKS WITH

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.182
FIRST FIVE AND OTHER LOCAL

00:46:25.249 --> 00:46:27.618
ENTITIES TO PROVIDE NECESSARY

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:30.053
SUPPLIES AND SERVICES- AT MY

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.123
AGENCY WE'VE DISTRIBUTED OVER

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.757
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FACE

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:36.093

TWELVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT TYPES

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.400
OF CLEANING SUPPLIES. AND IT'S

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.035
SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO DO ON

00:46:45.102 --> 00:46:47.504
A REGULAR BASIS PRIOR TO THE

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:48.772
PANDEMIC WE WEREN'T A

00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:50.274
DISTRIBUTION CENTER WE WEREN'T

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:52.042
USED TO RECEIVING PALLETS OF

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:53.477
GOODS THAT WE THEM DISTRIBUTED

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:55.879
TO OUR PROVIDERS BUT WE ARE NOW

00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:57.814
AND IT IS SOMETHING WE CONTINUE

00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.616
TO DO ON A WEEKLY BASIS AT ALL

00:46:59.683 --> 00:47:01.919
OF OUR LOCATIONS. WE'VE ALSO

00:47:01.985 --> 00:47:03.287
RECEIVED A LOT OF LOCAL

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:05.756
DONATIONS FROM BUSINESS AND

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:07.491
PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP

00:47:07.558 --> 00:47:08.792
BUT THERE STILL IS NOT ENOUGH

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:11.662
AND WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO SEEK

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.330
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR OUR

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.832
PROVIDERS. WE ALSO WORK THROUGH

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.201
GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.669
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

00:47:18.735 --> 00:47:19.970
ISSUE STIPENDS TO CHILD CARE

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:23.307
PROVIDERS THIS PAST FALL- IT

00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:26.210
WAS  START- WE NEED TO DO MORE

00:47:26.276 --> 00:47:28.212
AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:30.147
THINK THAT PROVIDERS COMMENTS

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.882
ABOUT. THE COSTS THEY HAVE

00:47:31.949 --> 00:47:33.951
TAKEN ON TO BE OPEN AND

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.586
OPERATING AS WELL AS THE

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:38.188
LIMITED ADULT TO CHILD RATIOS

00:47:38.255 --> 00:47:39.823
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.258
TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND IT'S

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:42.659
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:46.496
CONTINUE. TO SUPPORT THOSE

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:48.865
EFFORTS. WHAT I REALLY LIKE TO.

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:51.368
ON IS HAS WERE. AND WE NEED TO

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:53.070
DO GOING FORWARD THROUGH THE

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:56.573
PANDEMIC- THE FIRST THING IS

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.309
THE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO

00:47:59.376 --> 00:48:01.678
VOUCHERS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS.

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.380
AS I MENTIONED WE'VE ENROLLED

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:05.148
THOUSANDS OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS

00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:06.183
THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.119
WAITING WE STILL ARE WORKING TO

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:11.822
TRY TO MAKE SURE FAMILIES HAVE

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:12.589
ACCESS TO THE CARE THAT THEY

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.925
NEED. THE OTHER THING TO HAVE

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:16.960
IN CONSIDERATION AS WE LOOK AT

00:48:17.027 --> 00:48:19.263
THIS IS THE COST OF HAVING

00:48:19.329 --> 00:48:21.431
SCHOOLS CLOSED ON THE CHILD

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.500
CARE SYSTEM. MANY OF THE

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:25.836
PROVIDERS MENTIONED THAT THEY

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:28.305
ARE NOW. KRACHT DURING K.

00:48:28.372 --> 00:48:30.140
TWELVE EDUCATION IN THEIR CHILD

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.609
CARE SETTING AND WHAT THAT

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:34.478
MEANS IS IT'S ADDITIONAL COST

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:36.313
IT'S ADDITIONAL INTERNET IT'S

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:38.582
ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TIME AND

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:40.784
STAFFING BUT IT'S AN ALSO AN

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.386
ADDITIONAL COST TO MAKE SURE

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.454
THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR FULL TIME

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.423
CARE FOR SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.992
AND WE HAD- AN INCIDENT IN THE

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.360
FALL WHERE WE HAD TO GO BACK

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:52.596
AND TRY TO INCREASE THE DOLLARS

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:55.098
WE HAD AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:56.333
IT IS SUCCESSFULLY WITH THE

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.267
ADMINISTRATION ON THE

00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:58.735
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT COSTS

00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:01.204
MORE TO HAVE THE SCHOOLS CLOSED

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:03.140
IN THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.175
NEED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:07.711
CASH SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS. WE

00:49:07.778 --> 00:49:09.846
ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE

00:49:09.913 --> 00:49:11.281
DIFFERENT COST PROVIDERS ARE

00:49:11.348 --> 00:49:13.116
HAVING TO ENCOURAGE THAT'S

00:49:13.183 --> 00:49:15.152
CRITICAL FOR THAT. AND WE ALSO

00:49:15.218 --> 00:49:17.154
NEED TO CONTINUE PAYING

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:17.921
PROVIDERS BASED ON THEIR

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:20.490
ENROLLMENT NOT THE ATTENDANCE

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:21.858
WE KNOW FAMILIES ARE DOING

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:23.093
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MITIGATE

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.395
THEIR OWN RISK AND TO KEEP OUR

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:27.297
PROVIDERS STABLE AND OPEN WE'VE

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.866
GOT TO PAY THEM. TO KEEP THEIR

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:33.103
DOORS OPEN. AND WE ALSO NEED TO

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:34.371
DO SOME WORK YOU HEARD THAT

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:35.505
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.007
PROVIDERS THAT ARE TEMPORARILY

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:39.343
CLOSED WE'VE LOST SOME THAT

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:41.645
WILL NEVER COME BACK BUT WE ARE

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:42.412
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.481
INVESTMENTS TO KEEP OUR

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.116
PROVIDERS OPEN. TO HELP

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:49.686
STABILIZE THEM AND TO RE OPEN

00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:54.024
SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS. WHO

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.425
ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED. THAT'S

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:57.627
TO GET US THROUGH THIS PANDA.

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:59.730
ONCE WE START TO STABILIZE

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.264
THERE ARE ONGOING THINGS THE

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.900
STATE NEEDS TO CONSIDER TO

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.370
REALLY RESTORE AND BRING OUR

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:09.539
PROVIDERS BACK SO THAT OUR-

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.308
PARENTS HAVE THESE OPTIONS SO

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.110
THEY CAN GO TO WORK FIRST AND

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.745
FOREMOST WE HAVE TO INCREASE

00:50:14.811 --> 00:50:16.279
OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES TO

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.315
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. WE'VE

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:20.684
ASKED THESE WOMEN LARGELY WOMEN

00:50:20.751 --> 00:50:22.886
OF COLOR TO STEP UP TAKE RISKS

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:24.421
THEY BEEN HEROES DURING THIS

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:26.690
PANDEMIC AND WE'RE NOT PAYING

00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:28.625
THEM THE CURRENT MARKET COST OF

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.460
PROVIDING CARE I THINK THAT

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.162
SHAMEFUL AND I THINK WE NEED TO

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.131
DEAL WITH THAT IMMEDIATELY WE

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:36.400
NEED TO PROVIDE ON GOING

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:39.336
SUPPORT TO OPEN A NEW PROVIDERS

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.837
AND SUPPORT THOSE THAT ARE IN

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:42.072
BUSINESS TO EXPAND THEIR

00:50:42.139 --> 00:50:44.341
SERVICES. WE'VE LOST QUITE A

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:46.843
CHUNK OF OUR CHILD CARE SUPPLY

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.778
WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH BEFORE WE

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.980
STARTED SO THIS IS GOING TO BE

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.915
A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE WE

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.250
NEED TO MAKE SOME INVESTMENTS

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:54.518

DOLLARS THAT WILL BE WILL COME

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:17.674
ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN

00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:18.308
CALIFORNIA WILL GET THE LARGEST

00:56:18.374 --> 00:56:21.745
SHARE- OUR RECOMMENDATION IS

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:23.913
THAT THIS MONEY TO USE AND

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.216
REALLY INNOVATIVE WICKS. AND

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:29.252
WAYS THAT ARE NOT LIKE TYPICAL.

00:56:29.319 --> 00:56:32.355
MOST OFTEN MONIES LIKE THIS IS

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:34.991
OUR PUT OUT ON A FORMULA BASIS.

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.360
AND BASED ON A ROMANCE AND WE

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:38.628
THINK A BIG PART OF IT SHOULD

00:56:38.695 --> 00:56:40.363
BE USED MORE WITH MORE THE WAY

00:56:40.430 --> 00:56:41.898
WE WOULD DO IF WE ARE VENTURE

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:43.600
CAPITALIST AND WE'RE REALLY

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:46.136
TRYING TO STIMULATE. NEW

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:46.970
BUSINESSES COMING INTO

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:49.405
EXISTENCE AND IN THAT WAY I

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:50.740
THINK IT'S GONNA BE COUNTER TO

00:56:50.807 --> 00:56:52.142
THAT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IT'S

00:56:52.208 --> 00:56:54.077
HARD SOMETIMES FOR US TO THINK

00:56:54.144 --> 00:56:55.745
THAT WAY AS THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.547
BUT I THINK WE ARE SUSPEND A

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.482
LOT OF THE NORMAL- KIND

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.551
REQUIREMENTS SUSPEND THINGS

00:57:01.618 --> 00:57:04.354
LIKE- EVERY ALL MONEY GOES OUT

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.922
THE SON OF ROMANCE AND OTHER

00:57:05.989 --> 00:57:07.857
SORT OF FORMULAIC THINGS. AND

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.659
MAKE LIKE A LOT OF OUR PREVIOUS

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.494
MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUE SAID MAKE

00:57:11.561 --> 00:57:13.496
A LOT OF THIS MONEY AVAILABLE

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:15.265
TO HELP THESE BUSINESSES

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:17.467
RECOVER AND RESTART. AND THAT

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.302
MEANS THIS NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE

00:57:19.369 --> 00:57:22.505
DOLLARS MUCH LIKE THE PPP LOANS

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:23.773
WERE THAT WERE PUT OUT BY THE

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.542
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:28.511
PROVIDE CASH RIGHT UP FRONT AND

00:57:28.578 --> 00:57:34.417

00:57:36.886 --> 00:57:40.223
SHUT DOWN HARPER. WITH SOME C.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.091
MONEY TO REALLY COME BACK. AND

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:45.195
GIVE THE- A GOOD OF TIME SO

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:47.530
THERE IS. CAN REALLY. REBUILD

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:49.566
ITSELF. AND WE NEED TO HAVE

00:57:49.632 --> 00:57:51.167
SOME INNOVATION DOLLARS TO

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:52.902
PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.704
FOLKS TO IMAGINE A DIFFERENT

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.606
WAY OF FUNCTIONING IN INCENTIVE

00:57:56.673 --> 00:57:58.875
DOLLARS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER

00:57:58.942 --> 00:58:01.244
ABOUT- CENTERS BEING OUT TO

00:58:01.311 --> 00:58:04.314
OPEN STAY OPEN. TWENTY FOUR

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.348
SEVEN IN PROVIDE OUR PARENTS

WHAT THEY NEED- WE NEED A LOT

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:09.853
MORE CREATIVITY TO DO THAT. AND

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.654
THEN I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:13.489
NEED AN EYE TOWARD THE FUTURE

00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:15.758
TOO WE SHOULD BE. USING THESE

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.964
WITH THEM I'LL JUST GIVE YOU

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:24.666
ONE EXAMPLE OUR AND OUR ONE OF

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.034
OUR READY NATION MEMBERS HIS

COMPANY IN THE BAY AREA. HAS

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.341
THEN- HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT

01:13:32.407 --> 01:13:34.176
THIS BEFORE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:35.811
PANDEMIC HAS REALLY SEEN THEM

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:37.346
MASSIVE IMPACT THEY'VE BEEN

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:39.014
LOOKING AT HOW HOW DIDTHEY

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.216
FIND SPACE TO PUT OUR AN ONSITE

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.152
CHILDCARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF

01:13:43.218 --> 01:13:44.686
THE TECH COMPANIES IN THE BAY

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:47.389
AREA HAVE ONSITE CHILDCARE AND

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:48.524
MAKE THAT AVAILABLE FOR THEIR

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:52.127
EMPLOYEES- BUT THEN ALSO-

01:13:52.194 --> 01:13:54.229
BECAUSE AMGEN HAS HAD SUCH A

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.798
HARD TIME FINDING LAND IN THE

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.099
BAY AREA AS YOU KNOW IT'S VERY

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:59.668
EXPENSIVE- IS ALSO THINKING

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:02.704
ABOUT- HOW DO THEY PARTNER WITH

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:05.574
AN EXISTING PROVIDER TO. OFFER

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:08.710
SPACE FOR- FOR THEIR FOR THEIR

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.480
EMPLOYEES AND THEN LASTLY I

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:13.515
KNOW THAT MANY OF US HAVE HEARD

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:15.184
ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT PARTNER

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.252
WITH SPECIFIC TYPES OF

01:14:17.319 --> 01:14:19.021
PROVIDERS WHO CAN PROVIDE

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.390
SPECIALTY CARE FOR KIDS WHEN

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:25.227
THERE IS AN ILLNESS- OR OTHER

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.296
SORT OF CHILD CARE EMERGENCY

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:28.864
THERE HAVE BEEN BUSINESSES

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.966
THAT- THAT DO THAT KIND OF

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.669
WORK. AND AS THEIR AS THEIR

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:37.506
JOBS SO THAT JUST A FEW- A FEW

01:14:37.573 --> 01:14:39.308
WAYS AND AS I SAID I WILL

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:40.876

MEMBERS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:00.095
PAGE LEAVE- OBVIOUSLY RELATES.

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.563
TO THIS IS THE SAME ALL TOPIC

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.799
AS WE NEED TO SUPPORT. OUR OUR

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:07.502
NEW PARENTS- AND- THIS IS A

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.538
TIME WHEN SUPPORTING OR NEW

01:15:09.605 --> 01:15:10.272
PARENTS THEN IT'S EVEN MORE

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.608
IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT ALLEVIATE

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.543
SOME OF THE NEEDS FOR TAKING

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.312
CARE OF INTENSE FROM ZERO TO

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:18.747
SIX MONTHS OLD IF OUR IF OUR A

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:21.149
NEW PARENTS GET TO STAY AND GET

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:24.119
COMPENSATED FOR THAT TIME- SO I

JUST RESET YOUR LEADERSHIP

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.623
ONE'S GOING FORWARD. I THINK

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:28.824
THAT OBVIOUSLY IS ONE THING

01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:30.125
IT'S RELATED TO THE BUSINESS

01:15:30.192 --> 01:15:31.260
COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO BUSINESS

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:32.761
COMMITTEE TO EMBRACE AND

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:34.930
SUPPORT NEW PARENTS. AND KNOW

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.798
ABOUT THE- CERTAIN THE

01:15:36.865 --> 01:15:38.367
INCREASING POLICIES WE HAVE IN

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.102
CALIFORNIA FOR A LONGER PERIOD

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.304
AND FOR PROTECTED LEAVE FOR

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:44.606
SMALLER EMPLOYERS. TO YOUR

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:47.242
LARGER QUESTION I THINK THERE'S

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:47.976
TWO THINGS A BUSINESS CAN YOU

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:49.945
COME TO MIND IF THEY COME TO MY

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:51.446
FOR ME THAT THEY CAN DO ONE IS

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.248
JUST. THIS KIND OF WORK WE'RE

01:15:53.315 --> 01:15:54.483
DOING WITH TODAY'S HEARING IS

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:55.717
BUILDING AWARENESS OF THE

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.786
BUSINESS TREATY OF WHY THEY

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.154
NEED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.356
INVESTMENTS IN EARLY CARE AND

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.592
EDUCATION. SO THAT YOU'RE

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:05.360
ACCOMPLISHING WE NEED TO KEEP

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.528
DOING THAT EVEN BOLDER AND

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:08.664
BETTER ALL OF US. AND THAT'S

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:09.798
WHY WE ISSUED OUR BEACON

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.500
ECONOMICS REPORT TO TRY TO USE

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:12.935
BUSINESS SPEAK FOR AN

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.003
ECONOMISTS SAY YOU HAVE EVEN

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.271
MORE STAKE IN THIS THAN YOU

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.041
REALIZE. THE SECOND THING IS

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.943
THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE S. IS

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.878
GOOD AT REBUILDING BUSINESSES

01:16:22.945 --> 01:16:24.379
THAT IS THEIR EXPERTISE THAT'S

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:26.315
THEIR GREATEST EXPERTISE. WE

01:16:26.381 --> 01:16:27.616
SHOULD ENGAGE MORE OF THE

01:16:27.683 --> 01:16:29.685
BUSINESS COMMUNITY I USE OVER

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.920
DC EVENTUALLY CAPITALIST. AS

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:34.122
BEING MENTORS IN SUPPORT- SOME

01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.524
OF OUR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.392
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD AT TAKING

01:16:37.459 --> 01:16:39.227
CARE OF OUR CHILDREN BUT THEY

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:40.595
DON'T HAVE TRAINING IN HOW TO

01:16:40.662 --> 01:16:42.864
OPERATE A BUSINESS IN SOME

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:44.599
CASES MANY DO BY THE WAY BUT-

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:46.401
AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE

01:16:46.468 --> 01:16:47.970
MORE ROBUST SORT OF INVESTMENT

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:51.173
AND- IN BUILDING UP THE KIND OF

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.841
REST OF FOUR OF BUSINESS

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.710
LEADERS. THAT CAN PROVIDE

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.512
MENTORING AND SUPPORT TO OUR

01:16:57.579 --> 01:17:02.751
CHILD CARE. SECTOR ON HOW TO

01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.186
READ BUILDING- THAT'S WHAT REST

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.120
ARE GOING TO BE TO DO NOW. IN

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:05.754
WE REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT IT

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.255
LIKE WE ARE SO CONCERNED WITH

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:08.290
OUR RESTAURANTS AND TRAVEL AND

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:10.425
TOURISM. AND THAT IS HOW DO WE

01:17:10.492 --> 01:17:12.160
HELP THESE BUSINESSES REBUILD

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:14.663
THEMSELVES. I APPRECIATE THAT

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:15.263
ARE THERE ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.698
MEMBERS. OF PANELISTS WOULD

01:17:16.765 --> 01:17:18.000
LIKE TO SPEAK THIS QUESTION IT

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:20.168
IS A GOOD QUESTION- AND IF YOU

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:22.204
WOULD MY MISTER MERRICK. I

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.672
THINK YOU LIVE IN THAT SPACE

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.474
SO- IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THIS

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.910
JUST A LITTLE BIT. YES MY NAME

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:31.279
JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND- MY

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.081
COMPANY PARTNERS WITH EMPLOYERS

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.484
TO DEVELOP ON SITE- PRESCHOOLS

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.853
FOR THE BENEFIT OF- EMPLOYEES

01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:41.656
CHILDREN- AND- TO THE OTHER

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:44.493
SPEAKERS POINT. YOU KNOW THAT

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:46.328
IS A BENEFIT THAT. ONLY A

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.863
RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF

01:17:47.929 --> 01:17:50.232
EMPLOYERS CAN PROVIDE- GIVEN

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:52.000
THE RESOURCES REQUIRED SPACE

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.802
CONSTRAINTS THINGS ABOUT THAT

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:56.938
NATURE- BUT I THINK THAT ARE

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.341
SORT OF KIND OF MELD. THE TWO

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:02.477
PREVIOUS COMMENTATORS POINTS I

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:04.179
THINK ONE OF WONDER.

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:06.982
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING WAY

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:08.550
THAT CHILD CARE CENTERS CAN

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:12.421
REBUILD THEIR BUSINESS SAYS IS

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.156
BY PARTNERING WITH EMPLOYERS

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:17.225
LIKE AMGEN WHO IS LOOKING FOR A

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:19.594
BENEFIT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT

01:18:19.661 --> 01:18:21.663
BECAUSE OF SPACE CONSTRAINTS

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:25.100
CAN'T. DO THAT RIGHT AWAY BUT

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.601
TO THE EXTENT THAT EXISTING

01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:29.337
CHILD CARE OPERATORS HAVE-

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:31.640
ADDITIONAL UNUSED CAPACITY YOU

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:33.642

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:36.178
HOUSE ALSO THAT THESE-

01:18:36.244 --> 01:18:38.447
BUSINESSES. CAN HELP THEIR

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.415
EMPLOYEES MEET THEIR CHILD CARE

01:18:40.482 --> 01:18:42.951
NEEDS AND ALSO GIVE ALL A STEP

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.419
A LEG UP THE CHILD CARE

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:47.022
OPERATORS WHO WANT TO FILL

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:50.225

OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I

01:19:03.772 --> 01:19:05.373
THINK ONE OF THE- BIGGEST

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.175
LESSONS OF THE PANDEMIC IS HOW

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.810
CRITICAL CHILD IS THE CHILD

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:11.680
CARE IS TO OUR ECONOMY. AND I

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:13.882
THINK HOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.183
THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:16.885
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AS AN

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.520
UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILD CARE

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.322
IS AS IMPORTANT TO GETTING YOUR

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:23.125
EMPLOYEES TO WORK AS ROADS- IS

01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.426
REALLY IMPORTANT AND MAKING

01:19:24.493 --> 01:19:25.927
SURE THEY'RE AT THE TABLE AND I

UNDERSTANDING THE NEED FOR

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.201
PUBLIC INVESTMENT I THINK THERE

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:34.569
ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE IN A

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:37.072
POSITION TO DO SOME SUPPORT FOR

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.641
THEIR OWN EMPLOYEES BUT LARGELY

WE NEED A BROADER. ROBUST

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:45.380
SYSTEM THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF

PANELISTS WERE MENTIONING I

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.144

01:20:41.803 --> 01:20:42.571
INTEREST FROM THE GOVERNOR'S

REIMBURSEMENT RATE SHOULD

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:02.157
SHOULD NOT BE LOWERED AND THAT

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.292

CHILD CARE ISSUES FOR YOU KNOW

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.623
A FEW YEARS WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN

01:21:34.689 --> 01:21:36.358
WE NEVER HAD ENOUGH SPOT WHEN

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:37.025
IT WAS SUBSIDIZE OUR

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:39.628
UNSUBSIDIZED. SO THE PANDEMIC

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:42.397
HAS JUST- MEET THIS CHALLENGE

01:21:42.464 --> 01:21:45.600
SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER- FOR OUR

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:48.570
STATE AND- I KNOW THERE'S A FEW

01:21:48.637 --> 01:21:49.671
LESS THAT ARE WORKING ON

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:50.739
LEGISLATION TRYING TO

01:21:50.805 --> 01:21:52.607
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. BUT IT

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:56.044
STILL CREATES THIS ISSUE AND-

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:57.145
WE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:58.780
ENOUGH CERTAINLY THE GUIDELINES

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:00.749
AROUND PANDEMICS. I HAVE BEEN

VERY CAUTIOUS AND WE'VE HEARD A

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:05.287
LOT FROM CHILD CARE PROVIDERS-

01:22:05.353 --> 01:22:06.621
WHETHER IT'S CENTERS OR HOME

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.424
CARE THAT- YOU KNOW THEY'VE HAD

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:10.525
TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF SPOTS

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.360
BECAUSE OF THE GUIDELINES AT.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.896
AND IS THE MATH ISN'T WORKING

01:22:14.963 --> 01:22:16.598
OUT THE WITH THE WAY THAT- IT

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.033
WOULD NEED TO IN ORDER TO KEEP

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.801
SOME OF THESE FACILITIES ALIVE

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.569
AND SO- I HEARD A FEW

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.104
SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE MADE IN

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:24.472
TERMS OF POLICY THAT THE

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.241
LEGISLATURE CAN FACE COULD.

01:22:26.308 --> 01:22:27.809
ADDRESS WHICH OF COURSE

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:29.110
INCLUDES RATE REFORM BETWEEN

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:30.378
WE'VE BEEN OUT FOR A NUMBER OF

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:32.380
YEARS I KNOW CENTER LABELS-

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.049
CONTINUES TO LEAD THAT THAT

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.851
CONVERSATION- BUT YOU KNOW AT

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:39.721
THE IN LIGHT OF. THE FACT THAT

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:41.089
CHILD CARE COULD LOOK DIFFERENT

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:43.058
AND WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.327
THE MEANING. OF THE PARTNERING

01:22:45.393 --> 01:22:46.861
THE BUSINESS WHAT OTHER

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:49.197
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS THAT

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.399
COULD THE LEGISLATURE THINK OF

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.502
IN TERMS OF REMATCH ANNIE WHAT

01:22:54.569 --> 01:22:56.671
CHILD CARE LOOKS LIKE- IN IN

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.841
CERTAINLY THAT- IT IS SOMETHING

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:04.913
THAT. THE LEGISLATURE I THINK

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.314
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN. THANK

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:08.049

KNOW YOU KNOW CHILD CARE ISSUES

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:20.061

DID A COUPLE YEARS AGO. WE ARE

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.266

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:26.701
EFFORTS RELATED TO

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:28.403
REIMBURSEMENT RATE REFORM WHICH

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:30.939
IS REALLY FOUNDATIONAL TO BEING

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:33.041
ABLE TO SUSTAIN AND BRING NEW

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:35.977
PEOPLE INTO THE WORK FORCE- SO

PUT THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST ON

01:23:39.714 --> 01:23:41.950
OUR LIST I THINK OTHER THINGS

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:43.818
WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT IS.

01:23:43.885 --> 01:23:45.320
MAKING THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:47.956
MORE FLEXIBLE FOR FAMILIES

01:23:48.022 --> 01:23:51.626
MAKING IT MORE ACCESSIBLE BY

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:54.829
REFORMING AND RE RETHINKING THE

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:58.366
NEED FOR FAMILY FEES- EXPANDING

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.769
ACCESS TO NONTRADITIONAL TYPES

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:03.405
OF PROVIDERS UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:05.507
THERE ARE HOURS OF THE DAY AND

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:07.809
DAYS OF THE WEEK THAT AREN'T.

FACILITY AND I THINK

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.482
OPPORTUNITIES TO REALLY BUILD

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:16.151
OUR WORK FORCE I WE'VE BEEN

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.719

TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.292
AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS

01:24:24.359 --> 01:24:26.094
IS HOW MUCH WE PAY. ON THERE

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.295
IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:24:27.362 --> 01:24:29.164
INTERESTED IT'S THAT WE HAVE TO

01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:30.365
BE ABLE TO PAY A COMPETITIVE

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:31.800
WAGE TO BRING NEW PEOPLE TO THE

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:35.470
TABLE- IS SOME OF THAT- COULD

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:37.472
IT COULD BE- PARTNERED WITH

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:38.706
BUSINESS I KNOW WE'RE DOING A

01:24:38.773 --> 01:24:39.908

WORKFORCE AND BRING PEOPLE TO

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.416
THE TABLE IS CRITICALLY

01:24:48.483 --> 01:24:51.653
IMPORTANT AND LASTLY I'D I

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.721
THINK THAT CONTINUING TO

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:56.458
SUPPORT OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM

01:24:56.524 --> 01:24:58.092
SO THAT PARENTS HAVE TRUE

01:24:58.159 --> 01:25:00.695
CHOICE FOR THEIR CHILDREN BIRTH

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:03.531

AND ON SCHOOL HOLIDAYS IT MAKES

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.747
SOME NOT VERY HELPFUL SO HOW DO

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.082
WE START TO HAVE A

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:22.784
COMPREHENSIVE CHILD CARE

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.053

SOMETIMES SOME OF THESE

01:25:40.935 --> 01:25:42.904
OPPORTUNITIES- WE SEE

01:25:42.971 --> 01:25:45.306
DISPARITIES REGIONAL. REGIONAL

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:46.441
DISPARITIES AND SO I'M

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:48.409

TO PERHAPS ANY REGIONAL

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.312
DISPARITIES THAT WE MAY BE SEEN

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:52.714
WHETHER IT'S A PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.682
BUSINESSES WE A LOT OF COMMON

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:55.984
RIGHT A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.453
BAY AREA AREA. BUT WHAT WHAT

01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.921
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT OTHER

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:00.889
REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.757
SURELY STILL HAVE CHILD CARE

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.225
NEEDS- BUT WHERE THE

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.895
OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:07.428
BUSINESS MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY

01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:11.266
DIFFERENT. ANY PALACE PLEASE

OBVIOUS THING THANK YOU AGAIN

SENATOR FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.112
THIS SPACE- THE OBVIOUS THING

01:26:24.178 --> 01:26:26.381
IS WE SEE THE AREAS THAT HAVE

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:28.416
BEEN RESEARCH HISTORICALLY EVEN

01:26:28.483 --> 01:26:29.884
MORE IN DISTRESS NOW SO THERE'S

01:26:29.951 --> 01:26:32.453
GOING TO BE- ARE COMMUNITIES OF

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.488
COLOR OUR LOWEST INCOME

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.290
COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE HAVE THE

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:37.692
LOWEST WEALTH. AND WE HAVE THE

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:39.027
LEAST CAPITAL INVESTMENT AT

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.528
LEAST PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:43.064
LIKE YOU JUST SAID- WE HAVE THE

01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.667
MOST STRESS. SO NO SURPRISE

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.101
THERE BUT IT SHOULD BE A WAKE

01:26:47.168 --> 01:26:49.604
UP CALL AND WANT TO GO BACK TO

01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:52.941
THIS POSSIBLY- HUGE INVESTMENT

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.109
BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WE

01:26:55.176 --> 01:26:56.978
SHOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY MAKE

01:26:57.045 --> 01:27:00.181
THOSE MONIES AVAILABLE TO OUR-LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:01.816
OUR PROVIDERS IN THOSE LOWEST

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.751
INCOME COMMUNITIES. AND I KNOW

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:04.886
THAT'S NOT EASY BECAUSE OUR

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:06.321
MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES NEED

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:09.223
RESOURCES TO. BUT NOWHERE NEAR

01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:10.925
THE SAME PROPORTIONALITY IT'S

01:27:10.992 --> 01:27:12.994
NOT EVEN CLOSE SO I THINK IT'S

01:27:13.061 --> 01:27:14.262
GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

01:27:14.329 --> 01:27:16.664
THE LEGISLATURE TO- TO

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.600
DISPROPORTIONATELY ALLOCATE

01:27:18.666 --> 01:27:19.634
THOSE FEDERAL ONE TIME

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:21.636
RESOURCES TO REBUILDING AND

01:27:21.703 --> 01:27:23.972
SUPPORTING THE SECTOR. IN THE

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:25.974
LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.477
MOSTLY THE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.646
IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:36.150

01:27:40.788 --> 01:27:43.324
ADD- WERE ACTUALLY WORKING ON

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:45.159
ANOTHER REPORT AND WE DID A

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:47.595
NATIONAL REPORT ON THE IMPACT

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:49.197
OF LACK OF ACCESS TO CHILDCARE

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:51.599
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND HOW IT'S

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:53.001
FURTHER DEVASTATING RURAL

01:27:53.067 --> 01:27:54.769
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE FAMILIES

01:27:54.836 --> 01:27:57.572
CANNOT STAY. THEY CAN'T TAKE

01:27:57.639 --> 01:27:58.673
JOBS IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:01.342
ARE AVAILABLE AND BECAUSE THERE

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:03.611
IS NO CHILD CARE AVAILABLE AND

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:05.813
SO I THINK YOUR POINT IS

01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.417
EXACTLY THE RIGHT ONE- DIETS WE

01:28:09.484 --> 01:28:12.787
HAVE TO INVEST IN THE AREAS-

01:28:12.854 --> 01:28:15.590
AND- I'VE URBAN AREAS WHERE

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:16.090
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

01:28:16.157 --> 01:28:18.826
UNDERSERVED SYSTEMATICALLY BUT

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.828
ALSO IN RURAL AREAS SO THAT WE

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.563
CAN CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:24.132
RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MAKE IT

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:25.867
POSSIBLE FOR FAMILIES. GROWING

01:28:25.933 --> 01:28:28.903
UP THERE TO CONTINUE TO STAND

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.338
RAISE THEIR CHILDREN THEIR- I

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.040
APPRECIATE WHAT WE WILL LOOK

01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.007
FORWARD TO RECEIVING THAT

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:36.210
REPORT. THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:38.780
IN RESPONSE FROM PANELISTS. I

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:40.748
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK

01:28:40.815 --> 01:28:42.483
COMMENT I THINK I THINK WE ARE

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:43.851
LOOKING AT THE BUSINESS

01:28:43.918 --> 01:28:46.154
COMMUNITY IS GREAT BUT I THINK

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.522
WE SHOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:50.291
CAN WE EXPAND TO OTHER PUBLIC

01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:51.793
AGENCIES PROBABLY FORM

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:54.128
COLLABORATIONS INSTEAD OF. YOU

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.897
KNOW HIGHER IT BEING ISOLATED

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:56.998
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BEING

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:59.834
ISOLATED HARTLEY FARM HUMIDITY

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:02.704
PARTNERSHIPS- I'VE WORKED BOTH

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.772
IN WORLD CALIFORNIA IN NORTHERN

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:06.641
CALIFORNIA AND NOW IN SOUTHERN

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:09.077
CALIFORNIA VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:11.646
IN THE TWO AREAS AND TO COME UP

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.381
WITH ONE SYSTEM FOR. SAN

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:15.183
BERNARDINO COUNTY VERSUS

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.718
HUMBOLDT COUNTY THEY'RE THEY'RE

01:29:16.784 --> 01:29:18.720
DIFFERENT AND HOW DO WE GET THE

01:29:18.786 --> 01:29:21.289
COMMUNITY PARTNERS HIGHER ED

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:26.327
BUSINESS. ON PROVIDERS WORK TO.

01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:29.931
THAT'S I WOULD SAY. ALSO JUST

01:29:29.997 --> 01:29:31.666
ADDED A AND ANOTHER ISSUE THAT

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:33.234
WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED ON IS THE

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.603
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FACILITIES-

01:29:35.670 --> 01:29:36.771
YOU KNOW IN THE LAST BUDGET

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:39.407
THERE WAS AS A BLOCK GRANT

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:41.109
DEVOTED PARTICULARLY AND

01:29:41.175 --> 01:29:42.577
SPECIFICALLY FOR FACILITIES

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.378
THAT WAS SLAPPED AND WE KNOW

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:46.013
THAT THEIR CHILD CARE DESERTS

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:48.149
NOT JUST IN TERMS AND LACK OF

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.051
SUBSIDIZED DOLLARS FOR SPACES

01:29:50.118 --> 01:29:51.419
BUT FOR THE FACILITIES

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:53.387
THEMSELVES. AND SO I THINK

01:29:53.454 --> 01:29:54.789
THAT'S ANOTHER AREA AND

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.891
INVESTMENT THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:58.159
NOT ONLY RE OPENING GRANTS FOR

01:29:58.226 --> 01:29:59.894
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BUT BUT

01:29:59.961 --> 01:30:01.195
OPENING GRANTS AND

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:03.131
RETROFITTING- FACILITIES

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:04.298
PARTICULARLY TO SORT OF INFANTS

01:30:04.365 --> 01:30:05.399
AND INFANTS AND TODDLERS

01:30:05.466 --> 01:30:06.601
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:09.003
THE GREATEST NEED IS- INTO

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.438
DAVID'S POINT TO I THINK TECH

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:12.540
IS TAKING AN EQUITY FOCUSED

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:14.675
APPROACH TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:17.545
FEDERAL AND STATE DOLLARS IS

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.180
