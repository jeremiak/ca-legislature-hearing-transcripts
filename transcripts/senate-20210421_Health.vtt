01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.433
WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.602
AFFILIATIONS ARE ARE AN

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:55.071
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR YOU SEE TO

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.807
BE ABLE TO EXPAND ACCESS. THIS

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.642
IS NOT ABOUT ENDING

01:02:59.709 --> 01:03:02.345
AFFILIATIONS ON WHAT THIS IS

01:03:02.411 --> 01:03:07.450
ABOUT IS UC NOT HAVING

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:07.950
AFFILIATION CONTRACTS.

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.887
LITERALLY PROHIBIT YOU SEE

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.388
POSITION TO AT SARAH FROM

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:14.891
PERFORMING CARE THAT THEY THINK

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.792
IS NECESSARY. FOR THEIR

01:03:16.859 --> 01:03:20.530
PATIENTS. AND SO THE SOLUTION.

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:23.599
IS FOR THOSE CONTRACTS NOT TO

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.668
LIMIT THE ABILITY OF UC

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.837
PHYSICIANS TO PROVIDE CENTRAL

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:30.439
VALLEY RESIDENTS WITH ALL

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.209
APPROPRIATE CARE IT IS NOT IN

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.877

GO AND SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN YOUR

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.250
UC POSITION. AND THAT POSITION

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.852
IS LIMITED IN THE KIND OF CARE

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.820
THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO YOU

01:03:44.887 --> 01:03:46.956
THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. AND

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:51.093
DOT DOT IS WHAT HARMS ACCESS.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:54.797
TO CARE AND SO IF YOU ARE SET

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:57.366
FOR EXAMPLE- A RESIDENT OF THE

01:03:57.433 --> 01:03:58.968
CENTRAL VALLEY IN YOUR WOMAN

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:01.037
WHO'S HAVING A C. SECTION AND

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:01.971
YOU WANT TO HAVE A TUBAL

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:04.807
LIGATION. IN CONNECTION WITH

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:07.109
THAT C. SECTION. RIGHT NOW YOUR

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.545
UC PHYSICIAN MAY HAVE TO

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.881

AND THEN SEND YOU SOMEWHERE

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:20.289
ELSE TO HAVE A SECOND SURGERY

01:04:20.356 --> 01:04:23.059
TO DO THE TUBAL LIGATION WHICH

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.761
IS VERY VERY HARMFUL TO A

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:28.097
PATIENT INCREASE RISKS. AND NO

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.265
ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.366
THAT THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.368
HEALTHCARE AND YET THAT IS

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:35.238
WHAT. THE UC IS FORCING ITS

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.807
PHYSICIANS TO DO BY ENTERING

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.108
INTO THESE RESTRICTED

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:42.345
AFFILIATIONS SO THAT IS THE

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:49.885
SOLUTION. AND. SO I'VE BEEN TO

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:51.287
A COUPLE HOSPITALS NOT ALL

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:52.822

SERVICES THAT YOUR BILL WOULD

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.466
SHUT DOWN IN THESE FAITH BASED

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:07.903
HOSPITALS. IT SEEMS- NOT

SERVICES THAT THESE- THESE

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.312
FAITH BASED OR CATHOLIC HEALTH

SERVICES IT'S KIND OF A AND

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:22.551
COUNTER ARGUMENT TO WHAT YOU'RE

01:05:36.165 --> 01:05:38.267
PRODUCTIVE TO THIS BILL IF

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:39.201
YOU'RE GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:40.936
FACILITIES THAT DO PROVIDE THIS

01:05:41.003 --> 01:05:44.774
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A- WHAT THEY

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.042
CONSIDER I THINK A AND

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:50.413

UNDERSTANDING OF CONSCIENCE I

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:58.254
GUESS- AND SO IT DOES THE BILL

01:05:58.321 --> 01:05:59.922
REQUIRE OTHER HOSPITALS TO

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.457

FAITH BASED HOSPITALS THAT SO

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:06.195
CARE IS CONSISTENT AND WE DON'T

LOSE. ALL THE CARE THAT WE GET

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:11.767
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ON

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:14.003
DISPUTE DURING THE PROMISE THAT

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.905
THIS IS GONNA- BECAUSE CENTRAL

CARE. THE BILL ON REQUIRES DOES

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.413
NOT SHUT DOWN ANY FACILITIES.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.682
IT IS NOT PREVENT AFFILIATIONS

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.884
FROM HAPPENING. IT SIMPLY

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:31.787
PROVIDES THE UC PHYSICIAN OR

01:06:31.854 --> 01:06:34.390
OTHER PROVIDER. ON NEEDS TO BE

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:36.459
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE CARE THAT

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.228
THEY THINK. IS APPROPRIATE AND

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.097
NOT LITERALLY HAVE YOUR TO I

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.865
MEAN IF YOU IMAGINE GOING TO

YOUR DOCTOR AND THE DOCTOR

01:06:43.799 --> 01:06:45.634
SAYS. I THINK THAT THIS

01:06:45.701 --> 01:06:49.839
PROCEDURE WOULD BENEFIT YOU. I

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:50.373
THINK THAT THIS TREE WILL

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:51.607
BENEFIT YOU. BUT BECAUSE THESE

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:53.809
SCIENCE BASED RESTRICTIONS.

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.778
BECAUSE OF THESE POLICY BASED

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:56.912
RESEARCH AND I'M NOT ALLOWED TO

01:06:56.979 --> 01:06:58.280
PROVIDE IT TO YOU YOU HAVE TO

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.916
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT THEY TRY

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:01.517
TO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET

01:07:01.584 --> 01:07:04.153
IT DONE. DOT DOT SINCE IT'S IS

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.756
NOT APPROPRIATE AND THAT IS

01:07:06.822 --> 01:07:07.356
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT

01:07:07.423 --> 01:07:09.091
THIS ISN'T ABOUT. TELLING

01:07:09.158 --> 01:07:12.661
HOSPITALS WHAT WHAT SERVICES

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:13.796
THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE OR NOT

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.264
PROVIDE IT'S SAYING THAT IF THE

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:19.402
UC. IT'S GOING TO AFFILIATE.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.970
AND BASICALLY PARTNER WITH

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.304
ANOTHER HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE

01:07:22.371 --> 01:07:25.708
HEALTH CARE TO YOU SEE PATIENTS.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:27.676
THEN THOSE UC PHYSICIANS OR

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:29.278
PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:30.946
MAKE THEIR OWN MEDICAL JUDGMENT

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.648
ABOUT WHAT HEALTH CARE IS

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:37.853
APPROPRIATE AND NOT HAVE THEIR-THOSE DECISIONS MADE FOR THEM.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.490
pNOTHING TO DO WITH CLINICAL

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.726
JUDGMENT. I REALIZE THAT YOUR

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:44.660
BILL DOESN'T SAY THAT YOU

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.861
AUTOMATICALLY SHUT DOWN THESE

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.730
HOSPITALS BUT YOUR BILL DOES

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.765
SAY THAT- YOU SEE. THAT

01:07:49.832 --> 01:07:51.534
PHYSICIANS WOULD BEGIN CONTRACT

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.269
WITH YOU SEE YOU CEASE TO HAVE

01:07:53.335 --> 01:07:59.642
YOU SEE. A HOSPITAL FACILITIES

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.710
SO NOT HAVING THOSE FACILITIES

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.412
ARE NOT HAVING THOSE PHYSICIANS

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:06.115
AVAILABLE FOR AND- RESIDENCIES

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:08.117
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHEN MOST

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.719
OF THESE- MOST OF THE SERVICES

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.154
IN THESE FAITH BASED HOSPITALS

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.356
ARE LED AND RAN BY UC

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:17.693
PHYSICIANS. WOULD EVENTUALLY I

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.294
MEAN I REALIZE THAT YOUR BILL

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.428
DOESN'T SAY DIRECTLY SHUT THEM

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.362
DOWN BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.331
PHYSICIANS ON STAFF TO RUN

01:08:22.398 --> 01:08:24.600
THESE PROGRAMS SO THE PEOPLE IN

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:25.201
THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE ACCESS

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.603
TO CARE- AND THEN IT DOES

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:28.871
BASICALLY SHUT DOWN OUR

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.739
HOSPITALS ARE SIT DOWN SERVICE

01:08:30.806 --> 01:08:31.907
AT LEAST WE WOULDN'T BUILD

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:33.642
PROVIDE SERVICES. TO OUR

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.477
CONSTITUENTS BECAUSE THE

01:08:34.543 --> 01:08:35.711
MEDICAL PROVIDERS WOULDN'T BE

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:36.779
THERE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.080
THE KERRIER HOLDING OVER THEIR

01:08:38.147 --> 01:08:39.615
HEAD IS THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:40.783
TO GET YOU SEE QUALIFIED

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.817
MEDICAL PROVIDERS IF YOU

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:43.419
CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN A PLACE

01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.788
OF CONSCIOUS. IN MY COLLEAGUES

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:47.289

MEDICAL CARE. IN YOUR BILL

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:00.736
LIMITS THAT ACCESS TREMENDOUSLY

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.171
WHETHER IT DOES DIRECTLY OR

PREFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF

MY COMMENTS. IT'STHE ONLY ONE

IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT DOES

01:09:24.727 --> 01:09:27.897

FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.450
BE LIMITED WHEN YOU LOOK AT

THAT THEY BELIEVE IS BEST FOR

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:51.460
THE PATIENTS. BECAUSE THAT

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:53.562

01:18:53.628 --> 01:18:54.763
I'M YOU KNOW I'M A FORMER UC

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:57.332

WHAT KIND OF LESSON DO WE SEND

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:09.344
WHEN WE TELL THEM WELL YOU CAN

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:10.512
NAVIGATE TO YOUR PATIENTS BUT

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:12.481
WHEN AN INSTITUTION DENIES WHAT

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:13.014
YOU BELIEVE IS IN THE BEST

01:19:13.081 --> 01:19:15.183
INTEREST OF THE PATIENTS. YOU

AWAY AND NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:20.922
THAT CARE. AND SAME WITH STAFF

01:19:20.989 --> 01:19:24.292
MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE MODEL

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.193
THAT. SO WHO'S BEEN CERTAINLY

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.895
THIS IS A CHALLENGING ISSUE-

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.231
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR.

01:19:29.297 --> 01:19:31.900
YOU SEE TO. DEMONSTRATE THROUGH

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.002
ITS CONTRACTS THE VALUES THAT

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:35.570
OF THE INSTITUTION THAT IT

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.205
DOESN'T RESTRICTS MEMBERS OF

01:19:37.272 --> 01:19:38.540
ITS OWN FACULTY AND ITS OWN

01:19:38.607 --> 01:19:39.774
TRAINEES FROM PROVIDING THE

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:41.476
MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:42.377
AND IF THAT CONTRACT IS

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.179
UNACCEPTABLE TO THAT HOSPITAL

01:19:44.246 --> 01:19:45.413
THE HOSPITAL THAT'S AFFILIATING

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.084
AND IT'S A HOSPITAL THAT'S NINE

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:50.118
CARE TO THEIR PATIENTS. WE HAVE

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.119
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OF THAT

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:52.854
REFUSES ACCEPT THIS KIND OF

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:56.525

RESOLUTION- BUT WE NEED TO ALSO

01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:04.699

THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:07.769

EVERY PART OF THE STATE. AND I

01:20:12.908 --> 01:20:13.909
THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:14.976
THING WE WANT TO TRY TO

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.978

01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:00.106
CURRENT LAW ALREADY REQUIRES

LICENSED BY THE STATE THE

01:53:35.942 --> 01:53:37.477
LEGISLATION WAS NEEDED TO CLOSE

01:53:37.544 --> 01:53:39.879
THAT LOOPHOLE. TEN YEARS AGO

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:41.915
WHEN THAT LAW WAS BEING DEBATED

01:53:41.981 --> 01:53:43.983
THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL WHERE

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:45.351

01:53:49.622 --> 01:53:50.990
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AT THAT

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:52.692
TIME TO SUPPORT MANDATED

01:53:52.759 --> 01:53:54.460
COVERAGE. BUT THE LEGISLATURE

01:53:54.527 --> 01:53:56.196
DID NOT WANT TO CLOSE THE DOOR

01:53:56.262 --> 01:53:57.697
TO EMERGING MODALITIES AND

01:53:57.764 --> 01:53:59.032
THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WAS

01:53:59.098 --> 01:54:00.733
DRAFTED TO INCLUDE ALL OTHER

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.968
EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTION

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:04.637
PROGRAMS THIS MEANS. THAT IF

01:54:04.704 --> 01:54:05.572
AND WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:07.240
RESEARCH TO FIND THE AN

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:08.474
INTERVENTION IT'S EVIDENCE

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:11.277
BASED. IT IS COVERAGE THAT

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:13.046
WOULD NOT A DRAFTING ERROR. BUT

YOU'RE PER REPORT ON THIS BILL

01:54:15.348 --> 01:54:16.449
STATE THAT THERE'S INSUFFICIENT

01:54:16.516 --> 01:54:18.585
EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT

01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:19.452

MANDATED COVERAGE. FOR UNPROVEN

01:54:30.863 --> 01:54:33.166
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:34.667
COULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS

01:54:34.734 --> 01:54:35.768
IF KIDS ARE MOVED INTO LESS

IMPACTS- FROM THERE SETTING-

02:14:14.413 --> 02:14:15.914
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:14:15.981 --> 02:14:17.382
TREMENDOUS WORK GOING ON IN THE

02:14:17.449 --> 02:14:19.251
CARE ECONOMY AND OUR FRONTLINE

02:14:19.317 --> 02:14:20.952
WORKERS IN NURSING HOMES ACROSS

EVERY DAY TO HELP PEOPLE WE

PEOPLE WORKING THE PEOPLE

02:14:34.866 --> 02:14:36.768
RECEIVING THE CARE SO THIS BILL

02:14:36.835 --> 02:14:38.837
IS REALLY AN EFFORT TO BUILD

02:14:38.904 --> 02:14:40.772
MORE TRANSPARENCY ON THE BACK

02:14:40.839 --> 02:14:43.208
END OF THIS SYSTEM. TO ENSURE

02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:47.446
THAT- WE HAVE ADEQUATE DATA ON

02:14:47.512 --> 02:14:49.514
EXACTLY HOW THE CORPORATE

02:14:49.581 --> 02:14:51.917
STRUCTURES ON THE PRIVATE SIDE

02:14:51.983 --> 02:14:53.251
OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY

02:14:53.318 --> 02:14:55.454
INDUSTRY ARE OPERATING WE KNOW

02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.555
THERE'S SOME COMPLEX BUSINESS

02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:58.557
MODELS OUT THERE THIS IS A VERY

02:14:58.623 --> 02:15:00.025
LARGE INDUSTRY AT THE BALL

02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:01.726
FRANKLY OF THIS SKILLED NURSING

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:04.463
FACILITY INDUSTRY. IS RUN ON

02:15:04.529 --> 02:15:05.931
THE PRIVATE SIDE IN THREE

02:15:05.997 --> 02:15:07.299
QUARTERS A CARE IN THE STATE IS

02:15:07.365 --> 02:15:08.934
DELIVERED THAT WAY AND THAT

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.969
THERE'S REALLY NOT AN ADEQUATE

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:12.838
OVERSIGHT BOTH AT THE STATE

02:15:12.904 --> 02:15:14.005
LEVEL AS WELL AS THE LOCAL

02:15:14.072 --> 02:15:16.908
LEVEL- OF THIS OF THE FOR

02:15:16.975 --> 02:15:18.710
PROFIT SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY I

02:15:18.777 --> 02:15:19.778
WE KNOW THERE'S VERY GOOD WORK

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:21.079
GOING ON OUT THERE BUT WE KNOW

02:15:21.146 --> 02:15:23.648
THERE'S ALSO- THE RISK. IN SOME

02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:25.250
OF THESE CORPORATE STRUCTURES

02:15:25.317 --> 02:15:27.085
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

02:15:27.152 --> 02:15:29.788
RELATED PARTIES- WHERE MULTIPLE

02:15:29.855 --> 02:15:31.923
CORPORATE ENTITIES- MAY HAVE A

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:33.692
HOLDING OPERATE A SUPPLY

02:15:33.758 --> 02:15:35.627
COMPANY ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE

02:15:35.694 --> 02:15:37.829
CARE ALWAYS RELATED INJURIES

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:40.065
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT-

02:15:40.131 --> 02:15:42.901
THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE MADE AS

02:15:42.968 --> 02:15:44.903
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE SO THAT

02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:46.304
WE CAN BE SURE THE CARE IS

02:15:46.371 --> 02:15:50.976
REALLY BEING DELIVERED. TO

02:15:51.042 --> 02:15:51.543
WHERE IT NEEDS AND IS NEEDED

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:54.379
BOTH STE- THIS BILL IS- DEBT HE

02:15:54.446 --> 02:15:56.448
REALLY DOESN'T. CHANGE

02:15:56.515 --> 02:15:57.716
FUNDAMENTA THE STRUCTURE THE

02:15:57.782 --> 02:15:58.950
INDUSTRY AND IT DOESN'T ATTEMPT

02:15:59.017 --> 02:16:00.652
TO DO SO IT'S MUCH MORE SO

02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:02.554
ABOUT BRINGING THAT DATA TO

02:16:02.621 --> 02:16:04.122
LIGHT AND HOPEFULLY WITH A BIT

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:06.558
OF SUNLIGHT- WE CAN HAVE MORE

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:08.994
TRUST IN THE PLACES THAT WE

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:10.629

OURSELVES WILL WILL END UP

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.202
THERE SO I CONSIDER THIS A DOWN

02:16:17.269 --> 02:16:21.306
PAYMENT- ON- A MORE TRANSPARENT

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:24.242

02:31:44.662 --> 02:31:46.063
BEGINNING OF MY JOURNEY INTO

02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:47.865
THIS ISSUE AND TRYING TO FIGURE

FORCE SIDE OF THINGS AND THE

02:32:09.587 --> 02:32:11.822
LIMITATIONS THAT WE'VE GOT-

02:32:11.889 --> 02:32:14.992
INABILITY TO SORT OF CONTAIN

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:17.294
QUARANTINE MANAGE THESE THINGS

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:19.063

02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:05.489
DO BUSINESS WITH. THE SKILLED

02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:07.691
NURSING FACILITIES- FROM MY

02:36:07.758 --> 02:36:09.326
PERSPECTIVE BASED ON WHAT I WAS

02:36:09.393 --> 02:36:11.695
ABLE TO READ IN THE AMENDMENTS

02:36:11.762 --> 02:36:12.796

HEARING STARTED- BUT AS DRAFTED

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:25.876
THE BILL APPEARS TO BE A BIT

02:36:25.943 --> 02:36:28.312
TOO BROAD. OF FRANKLY IN THAT

02:36:28.378 --> 02:36:30.447

SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES.

02:36:38.355 --> 02:36:41.191
BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE IT'S

02:36:41.258 --> 02:36:44.194
THE CONTROL OF THOSE AFFILIATED

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:45.896

AND CONTROL IS NOT 1% CONTROL

02:37:00.577 --> 02:37:04.181
IS NOT 5% CONTROL IS CONTROL.

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:06.250
OF THE AFFILIATED BUSINESSES

02:37:06.316 --> 02:37:07.184
CLEARLY IF WE'RE GONNA BE

02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:09.753

SPENT ENGAGING WITH ME ON AN

ISSUE THAT I KNOW WE ALL TAKE

03:34:28.121 --> 03:34:30.390
VERY SERIOUSLY. AS WE STAND

03:34:30.457 --> 03:34:32.626
HERE TODAY. WE ALL HOPE THAT

03:34:32.693 --> 03:34:34.061
THE WORST OF THIS PANDEMIC IS

03:34:34.127 --> 03:34:37.364
OVER. WE LOOK TO THE COMING

03:34:37.431 --> 03:34:39.766
SUMMER WITH HOPE AND OPTIMISM.

03:34:39.833 --> 03:34:42.703
BUT AS WE DO. WE SHOULD PAUSE

03:34:42.769 --> 03:34:44.104
AND GIVE AND GRIEVE OVER THE

03:34:44.171 --> 03:34:46.073
LIVES OF MORE THAN SIXTY

03:34:46.139 --> 03:34:46.540
THOUSAND OF OUR FELLOW

03:34:46.607 --> 03:34:48.909
CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN CUT

03:34:48.976 --> 03:34:51.612
SHORT BY COBIT NINETEEN. THIS

03:34:51.678 --> 03:34:53.814
INVISIBLE BUT DEADLY VIRUS THAT

03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:55.782
HAS BROUGHT US SO MUCH MISERY

03:34:55.849 --> 03:34:59.152
IN OUR STATE. WE SHOULD BE

03:34:59.219 --> 03:35:02.256
ESPECIALLY MINDFUL THAT MOST OF

03:35:02.322 --> 03:35:04.491
THOSE WHO THAT WHO HAVE DIED.

03:35:04.558 --> 03:35:06.026
WE'RE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE

03:35:06.093 --> 03:35:08.528
IN OUR SOCIETY. EITHER BY

03:35:08.595 --> 03:35:10.330
VIRTUE OF BEING POOR. FOR

03:35:10.397 --> 03:35:14.501
ELDERLY ARE CHRONICALLY ILL FOR

03:35:14.568 --> 03:35:15.969
BECAUSE THEY WERE AN ESSENTIAL

03:35:16.036 --> 03:35:19.640
WORKERS WHO RISKED THEIR LIFE.

03:35:19.706 --> 03:35:22.776
TO HARVEST OUR FOOD TEND TO THE

03:35:22.843 --> 03:35:26.980
SICK OR KEEP US SAFE. AS WE DO

03:35:27.047 --> 03:35:30.083
LOOK BACK ON ALL THOSE LIVES

03:35:30.150 --> 03:35:31.418
LOST WE SHOULD ALSO ASK

03:35:31.485 --> 03:35:34.421
OURSELVES. WHAT COULD WE HAVE

03:35:34.488 --> 03:35:37.557
DONE DIFFERENT. AND IF GOD

03:35:37.624 --> 03:35:39.459
FORBID SOMETHING LIKE THIS EVER

03:35:39.526 --> 03:35:42.796
HAPPENS AGAIN. WHAT COULD WE DO

03:35:42.863 --> 03:35:48.101
BETTER. ULTIMATELY STOPPING THE

03:35:48.168 --> 03:35:49.603
SPREAD OF THE HIGHLY INFECTIOUS

03:35:49.670 --> 03:35:51.805
VIRUS COMES DOWN TO HUMAN

03:35:51.872 --> 03:35:54.775
BEHAVIOR. A VIRUS SPREADS VIA

03:35:54.841 --> 03:35:56.943
ACTIVITY THAT COMES SO

03:35:57.010 --> 03:35:59.179
NATURALLY TO ALL OF US AND

03:35:59.246 --> 03:36:00.881
SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US CRAZY

03:36:00.947 --> 03:36:02.883
SIMPLE HUMAN INTERACTIONS WITH

03:36:02.949 --> 03:36:06.153
OUR FAMILY WITH OUR FRIENDS HI

03:36:06.219 --> 03:36:09.489
EVEN WITH STRANGERS. PREVENTING

03:36:09.556 --> 03:36:12.459
THE SPREAD REQUIRES PEOPLE TO

03:36:12.526 --> 03:36:12.893
CONTAIN ALL OF THAT

03:36:12.959 --> 03:36:15.629
INTERACTION. AND AT TIMES

03:36:15.696 --> 03:36:17.731
UNPLEASANT AS IT MAY BE IT

03:36:17.798 --> 03:36:19.333
REQUIRES OUR GOVERNMENT TO TAKE

03:36:19.399 --> 03:36:21.835
STEPS TO PREVENT HUMANS FROM

03:36:21.902 --> 03:36:26.506
INTERACTING WITH ONE ANOTHER.

03:36:26.573 --> 03:36:28.141
IF WE ARE TO DO THIS AND IF

03:36:28.208 --> 03:36:29.609
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE ANY

03:36:29.676 --> 03:36:31.411
CONFIDENCE IN THE DECISIONS

03:36:31.478 --> 03:36:33.513
THAT GOVERNMENT MAKES IT A TIME

03:36:33.580 --> 03:36:35.816
OF SUCH STRESS IN PERIL. IT IS

03:36:35.882 --> 03:36:37.250
CRUCIAL THAT OUR DECISIONS BE

03:36:37.317 --> 03:36:40.887
BASED ON DATA. AND SCIENCE. AND

03:36:40.954 --> 03:36:42.556
THAT WE SHARE THE INFORMATION

03:36:42.622 --> 03:36:44.224
THAT POWERS THOSE DECISIONS

03:36:44.291 --> 03:36:48.228
WITH THE PUBLIC. THINK OF HOW

03:36:48.295 --> 03:36:50.697
MANY TIMES. YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED

03:36:50.764 --> 03:36:52.566
OVER THIS PAST YEAR TO EXPLAIN

03:36:52.632 --> 03:36:54.267
THE DECISIONS THAT THE STATE

03:36:54.334 --> 03:36:57.404
HAS MADE. WHY ARE SOME SCHOOLS

03:36:57.471 --> 03:37:00.874
OPENED AND SOME CLOTHES. WHILE

03:37:00.941 --> 03:37:03.543
I WAS OUTDOOR DINING BAND WHILE

03:37:03.610 --> 03:37:07.514
INDOOR MALLS WERE OKAY. ARE WE

03:37:07.581 --> 03:37:09.049
TOLD THAT FRESH AIR AND

03:37:09.116 --> 03:37:10.784
VENTILATION WERE KEY BUT WE

03:37:10.851 --> 03:37:12.652
SHOULD STAY INSIDE OUR HOMES

03:37:12.719 --> 03:37:14.121
WHY CAN'T I GO OUT AND GET MY

03:37:14.187 --> 03:37:15.722
HAIR CUT OR EVEN STYLED IF I

03:37:15.789 --> 03:37:18.258
WEAR A MASK WHY CAN'T MY KIDS

03:37:18.325 --> 03:37:22.295
PLAY SPORTS. OUTSIDE IF YOU ARE

03:37:22.362 --> 03:37:23.830
LIKE ME YOU WERE ASKED THESE

03:37:23.897 --> 03:37:25.766
QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER AND

03:37:25.832 --> 03:37:28.502
OVER AGAIN. AND WERE UNABLE TO

03:37:28.568 --> 03:37:30.270
ANSWER THEM BECAUSE WE WERE

03:37:30.337 --> 03:37:32.472
NEVER SHOWN THE DATA THAT

03:37:32.539 --> 03:37:35.976
BACKED UP THOSE DECISIONS. THIS

03:37:36.042 --> 03:37:38.779
LACK OF PUBLIC DATA HAS LED TO

03:37:38.845 --> 03:37:40.280
A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN

03:37:40.347 --> 03:37:42.249
NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL

03:37:42.315 --> 03:37:44.518
POLICIES. THAT HAVE LED TO A

03:37:44.584 --> 03:37:46.186
LACK OF ADHERENCE TO THESE

03:37:46.253 --> 03:37:48.321
GUIDELINES. THAT WILL LEAD TO

03:37:48.388 --> 03:37:50.223
MORE INTERACTIONS WERE

03:37:50.290 --> 03:37:54.561
INFECTIONS. OR HOSPITALIZATIONS

03:37:54.628 --> 03:37:57.564
AND SADLY MORE DEATHS. TO DO

03:37:57.631 --> 03:38:00.634
BETTER WE NEED IF YOU WILL

03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:03.069
NORTHSTAR THE NORTH STAR TO

03:38:03.136 --> 03:38:04.004
GUIDE NOT JUST OUR PUBLIC

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:05.806
POLICY BUT OUR PERSONAL

03:38:05.872 --> 03:38:08.208
DECISIONS SOMETHING WE CAN ALL

03:38:08.275 --> 03:38:10.444
HAVE FAITH IN. AND THAT'S WHAT

03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:14.047
THIS BILL IS ABOUT. SB SEVEN

03:38:14.114 --> 03:38:15.048
FORTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE THE

03:38:15.115 --> 03:38:16.550
STATE TO COLLECT AND MAKE

03:38:16.616 --> 03:38:19.019
AVAILABLE MORE DATA. ABOUT THE

03:38:19.085 --> 03:38:19.986
SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS

03:38:20.053 --> 03:38:22.456
RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN A

03:38:22.522 --> 03:38:26.092
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. WE ARE

03:38:26.159 --> 03:38:27.761
MORE THAN A YEAR INTO THE CODE

03:38:27.828 --> 03:38:29.729
NINE PANDEMIC WE STILL HAVE

03:38:29.796 --> 03:38:31.164
VERY LITTLE SCIENCE SUPPORTING

03:38:31.231 --> 03:38:33.200
OUR BELIEF ABOUT THE HEIL THE

03:38:33.266 --> 03:38:35.368
HOW THE VIRUS IS SPREAD AND

03:38:35.435 --> 03:38:36.269
WHICH MEASURES ARE MOST

03:38:36.336 --> 03:38:37.671
EFFECTIVE IN SHOWING INST

03:38:37.737 --> 03:38:41.074
SLOWING OR STOPPING THAT SPREAD.

03:38:41.141 --> 03:38:43.043
IN THE FUTURE PANDEMIC WHICH IS

03:38:43.109 --> 03:38:45.245
THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL. WE NEED

03:38:45.312 --> 03:38:47.414
MORE THAN INTUITION AND

03:38:47.481 --> 03:38:49.349
ANECDOTES WE NEED SCIENCE AND

03:38:49.416 --> 03:38:52.352
GOOD SCIENCE DEPENDS ON GOOD

03:38:52.419 --> 03:38:54.988
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA. NO

03:38:55.055 --> 03:38:57.224
MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON THE

03:38:57.290 --> 03:38:58.558
ISSUES THAT HAVE DIVIDED

03:38:58.625 --> 03:39:01.228
CALIFORNIANS THIS PAST YEAR

03:39:01.294 --> 03:39:03.897
OPEN CLOSE OPEN CLOSE. EVERYONE

03:39:03.964 --> 03:39:05.499
SHOULD WANT TO HAVE THE KIND OF

03:39:05.565 --> 03:39:06.266
DATA THAT CAN GROUND THESE

03:39:06.333 --> 03:39:09.135
DECISIONS. WHILE THE STATE IS

03:39:09.202 --> 03:39:10.770
COLLECTED AT LEAST SOME DATA ON

03:39:10.837 --> 03:39:12.873
NEARLY FOUR MILLION CASES VERY

03:39:12.939 --> 03:39:14.241
LITTLEOF THAT INFORMATION IS

03:39:14.307 --> 03:39:16.142
SEEING THE LIGHT OF DAY.

03:39:16.209 --> 03:39:17.477
CURRENTLY THE STATE PROVIDES A

03:39:17.544 --> 03:39:18.712
STATEWIDE SUMMARY OF

03:39:18.778 --> 03:39:20.847
DEMOGRAPHIC DATA INCLUDING AGE

03:39:20.914 --> 03:39:22.649
SEX AND ETHNICITY. BUT LITTLE

03:39:22.716 --> 03:39:25.519
ELSE. AND EACH COUNTY THERE

03:39:25.585 --> 03:39:27.487
HAVE BEEN. GUIDELINES ON

03:39:27.554 --> 03:39:29.589
DISCLOSURES. BUT IT REALLY HAS

03:39:29.656 --> 03:39:31.958
COME DOWN TO RUBIK'S CUBE OF

03:39:32.025 --> 03:39:35.161
SCRAMBLED INFORMATION. MISTER

03:39:35.228 --> 03:39:36.363
CHAIRMAN IN RESPONSE TO YOUR

03:39:36.429 --> 03:39:37.831
CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL AND

03:39:37.898 --> 03:39:39.399
PROTECTING PRIVACY AS A GOAL

03:39:39.466 --> 03:39:42.569
THAT WE BOTH SHARE. I ACCEPT

03:39:42.636 --> 03:39:43.069
THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED

03:39:43.136 --> 03:39:45.105
AMENDMENTS. IF ENACTED

03:39:45.171 --> 03:39:47.140
IMPROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. IT WILL

03:39:47.207 --> 03:39:48.742
GIVE BONA FIDE RESEARCHERS

03:39:48.808 --> 03:39:51.077
BETTER AND QUICKER ACCESS. TO

03:39:51.144 --> 03:39:53.380
DATA THAT TAKEN THAT CAN FUEL

03:39:53.446 --> 03:39:55.081
THEIR STUDY THAT COULD SAVE

03:39:55.148 --> 03:39:58.652
LIVES. UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE

03:39:58.718 --> 03:39:59.853
NOT ABLE TO COME TO A SIMILAR

03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:03.957
pAGGREGATED DATA. THAT WOULD

03:40:04.024 --> 03:40:05.625
HELP POLICY MAKERS CRAFT BETTER

03:40:05.692 --> 03:40:07.861
DECISIONS AND HELP THE PUBLIC

03:40:07.928 --> 03:40:09.763
UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE RISK OF

03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:13.133
VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. BUT EVEN

03:40:13.199 --> 03:40:15.168
WITH THE MODEST EXPANSION IN

03:40:15.235 --> 03:40:17.904
THIS BILL AS AMENDED. WE WILL

03:40:17.971 --> 03:40:19.372
STILL BE PROVIDING FAR LESS

03:40:19.439 --> 03:40:20.540
INFORMATION AND SO MANY

03:40:20.607 --> 03:40:24.811

04:02:13.318 --> 04:02:14.653
ANSWER THIS ACTUALLY THIS IS A

04:02:14.720 --> 04:02:16.488
CHALLENGE THAT- THAT I THINK

04:02:16.555 --> 04:02:18.090
CENTER WIENER AND I WORKED ON

04:02:18.156 --> 04:02:18.924
AND TRY TO COLLECT SOME DATA

04:02:18.991 --> 04:02:20.692
REGARDING. FOR EXAMPLE SEXUAL

04:02:20.759 --> 04:02:23.462
ORIENTATION AND JUST FOR HAVING

04:02:23.528 --> 04:02:24.329
TO FIELD ACTUALLY GETTING THE

04:02:24.396 --> 04:02:26.798
DATA ON THAT THE OTHER PART

04:02:26.865 --> 04:02:29.301
THAT WE DID IS THAT- WE DID

04:02:29.368 --> 04:02:30.569
CREATE A MECHANISM BY WHICH

04:02:30.636 --> 04:02:31.737
RESEARCH BUT A FIGHT

04:02:31.803 --> 04:02:34.072
RESEARCHERS AND- YOU TO PROTECT

04:02:34.139 --> 04:02:35.340
PRIVACY COULD ACTUALLY OF

04:02:35.407 --> 04:02:36.909
ACCESS TO DATA BUT THEN HAD TO

04:02:36.975 --> 04:02:38.143
KEEP COULD NOT RELEASE

04:02:38.210 --> 04:02:39.678
INDIVIDUAL DATA AGAIN TO

04:02:39.745 --> 04:02:40.412
PROTECT PRIVACY THIS IS

04:02:40.479 --> 04:02:42.080
SOMETHING THAT IS ALSO DONE

04:02:42.147 --> 04:02:44.116
WITH OTHER DATASETS AS WELL- SO

04:02:44.182 --> 04:02:45.284
THEY'D HAVE TO DO IT ONLY UNDER

04:02:45.350 --> 04:02:47.119
A BONA FIDE EMMA YOU. AND THAT

04:02:47.185 --> 04:02:48.754
WE DID DELETE IT- TURN THE

04:02:48.820 --> 04:02:51.523
PARTS THAT CALLED FOR-

04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:58.764
ESSENTIALLY PUBLIC YEP BOB.

04:02:58.830 --> 04:02:59.998
PUBLIC CATION. MANDATED PUBLIC

04:03:00.065 --> 04:03:01.333
REPORT- UNDER DISCUSSION INCOME.

04:03:01.400 --> 04:03:04.503
OF DATA TO ENSURE. WE IN.

04:03:04.569 --> 04:03:05.570
REQUIRED A PUBLIC HEALTH

04:03:05.637 --> 04:03:08.140
DEPARTMENT TO RELEASE. DATA IN

04:03:08.206 --> 04:03:09.241
A WAY THAT COULD COMPROMISE

04:03:09.308 --> 04:03:11.243
PRIVACY RECOGNIZING I THINK

04:03:11.310 --> 04:03:12.044
IT'S A MENTION BY SOME OF THE

04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:13.946
OPPOSITION THAT. EVEN IF THIS

04:03:14.012 --> 04:03:15.948
QUOTE UNQUOTE D. INDEMNIFIED.

04:03:16.014 --> 04:03:17.215
IT SOMEONE COULD READ DEPENDING

04:03:17.282 --> 04:03:18.383
ON THE NATURE OF WHAT THE

04:03:18.450 --> 04:03:19.584
REPORT IS YOU CAN REVERSE

04:03:19.651 --> 04:03:21.486
ENGINEER IT TO FIGURE OUT LIKE-

04:03:21.553 --> 04:03:22.654
IT'S CERTAIN NUMBER CASES IN

04:03:22.721 --> 04:03:24.256
CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS SO FORTH.

04:03:24.323 --> 04:03:25.657
SO AGAIN TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN

04:03:25.724 --> 04:03:27.359
MAINTAIN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS

04:03:27.426 --> 04:03:28.160
AND THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

04:03:28.226 --> 04:03:28.627
DEPARTMENT HAVE THAT

04:03:28.694 --> 04:03:30.495
DISCRETION. SO JUST ONE AGAIN

04:03:30.562 --> 04:03:32.064
GO OVER WHAT THE AMENDMENTS

04:03:32.130 --> 04:03:33.966
WERE INVOLVED- SO WITH THAT I

04:03:34.032 --> 04:03:37.502
SEE A CENTER WIENER HAS THIS-

04:03:37.569 --> 04:03:40.272

AND THAT'S CHAIR MENTIONED THIS

04:03:48.113 --> 04:03:48.914
IS SOMETHING THAT. WE WORKED

04:03:48.981 --> 04:03:51.116
ON. WE REALIZED EARLY ON IN THE

04:03:51.183 --> 04:03:52.851
PANDEMIC THAT DATA WAS NOT

04:03:52.918 --> 04:03:55.253
BEING COLLECTED. ON THE LGBTQ

04:03:55.320 --> 04:03:56.788
COMMUNITY AND COVERED IMPACTS

04:03:56.855 --> 04:03:58.523
AND SO WE- WE DID PASS

04:03:58.590 --> 04:03:59.658
LEGISLATION IS HERE WORKING

04:03:59.725 --> 04:04:02.961
WITH US OUR LAST YEAR WORKING

04:04:03.028 --> 04:04:04.229
WITH THIS COMMITTEE- TO

04:04:04.296 --> 04:04:07.132
REQUIRE- DATA COLLECTION AROUND

04:04:07.199 --> 04:04:09.167
COVE AND OTHER REPORTABLE.

04:04:09.234 --> 04:04:10.168
REPORTABLE COMMUNICABLE

04:04:10.235 --> 04:04:12.104
DISEASES RELATING TO SEXUAL

04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:13.872
ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY I

04:04:13.939 --> 04:04:15.774
DO JUST WANNA STAY HUMBLE

04:04:15.841 --> 04:04:18.076
STATUS AGAIN. THOUGH WE STILL

04:04:18.143 --> 04:04:20.212
DON'T HAVE THAT DATA BACK BILL

04:04:20.278 --> 04:04:22.247
HAS BEEN IN THE FACT THAT LAW

04:04:22.314 --> 04:04:22.781
HAS BEEN THE FOCUS OF HIS

04:04:22.848 --> 04:04:25.417
URGENCY. FOR I WON'T USE ANY

04:04:25.484 --> 04:04:26.585
SWEAR WORDS RIGHT NOW WITH

04:04:26.651 --> 04:04:27.652
THEIR SWIRLING AROUND IN MY

04:04:27.719 --> 04:04:29.721
HEAD BUT FOR SEVEN YOU KNOW

04:04:29.788 --> 04:04:33.125
WHAT MONTHS. SEVEN MONTHS THAT

04:04:33.191 --> 04:04:34.326
HAS BEEN THE LAW OF THE STATE

04:04:34.393 --> 04:04:36.228
OF CALIFORNIA AND WE STILL DO

04:04:36.294 --> 04:04:38.330
NOT HAVE THAT T. C. PH HAS

04:04:38.397 --> 04:04:40.032
LIMITED DATA ABOUT CONTACT

04:04:40.098 --> 04:04:41.900
TRACING. BUT IN TERMS OF ACTUAL

04:04:41.967 --> 04:04:44.903
COVERT TESTS WE DO NOT HAVE

04:04:44.970 --> 04:04:47.039
MORE THAN VERY SPORADIC

04:04:47.105 --> 04:04:48.974
INCONSISTENT DATA. AND WHAT

04:04:49.041 --> 04:04:50.642
WE'VE LEARNED IS YOU KNOW I'VE

04:04:50.709 --> 04:04:52.444
SIGNIFICANT FRUSTRATIONS WITH

04:04:52.511 --> 04:04:55.847
CDPH AND THEIR IMPLEMENTATION.

04:04:55.914 --> 04:04:58.083
BUT THERE'S ALSO ISSUES OF HOW-

04:04:58.150 --> 04:05:01.053
HOW LIVES REPORT RESULTS SINCE

04:05:01.119 --> 04:05:02.421
THE DATA GETS COLLECTED AND

04:05:02.487 --> 04:05:05.123
THEY GOT STRIPPED OUT. BECAUSE

04:05:05.190 --> 04:05:08.994
THE NATIONAL. LAB STANDARDS

04:05:09.061 --> 04:05:10.829
DON'T INCLUDE THOSE FIELDS SO

04:05:10.896 --> 04:05:12.764
THIS WILL APPLY TO THESE FIELDS

04:05:12.831 --> 04:05:15.567
AS WELL THE NATIONAL STUDENT

04:05:15.634 --> 04:05:16.001
LAB STANDARD SETTING

04:05:16.068 --> 04:05:18.236
ORGANIZATION. WON'T HAVE THESE

04:05:18.303 --> 04:05:20.872
FIELDS AND SO THEY'LL THEY'LL

04:05:20.939 --> 04:05:23.141
ASK A WHEN YOU GET YOUR BLOOD

04:05:23.208 --> 04:05:25.143
WORK. BUT THEN IT'S GOING TO

04:05:25.210 --> 04:05:27.946
GET STRIPPED OUT SO IT'S IT IS

04:05:28.013 --> 04:05:30.248
ABSOLUTELY MADDENING AND I'VE

04:05:30.315 --> 04:05:33.218
ENORMOUS FRUSTRATIONS. WITH THE

04:05:33.285 --> 04:05:35.487
DEPARTMENT FOR NOT DEALING WITH

04:05:35.554 --> 04:05:37.656
THIS FOR NOT WORKING IT OUT FOR

04:05:37.722 --> 04:05:39.157
NOT FINDING A WAY TO MAKE SURE

04:05:39.224 --> 04:05:41.193
WE'RE GETTING- THE STATE AND I

04:05:41.259 --> 04:05:43.061
AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR. THAT WE

04:05:43.128 --> 04:05:44.930
HAVE A AND MORE FORTUNATELY WE

04:05:44.996 --> 04:05:46.131
SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF

04:05:46.198 --> 04:05:47.432
MORE MOVING CLOSER TO THE LIGHT

04:05:47.499 --> 04:05:48.834
AT THE END OF TOWN. TOWN OVER

04:05:48.900 --> 04:05:51.103
THIS PANDEMIC. BUT IT'S BEEN A

04:05:51.169 --> 04:05:53.638
HUGE LOSS OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT

04:05:53.705 --> 04:05:55.941
OF DATA COLLECTION- AND I KNOW

04:05:56.007 --> 04:05:57.542
CENTER CABALLERO HAD A BILL IN

04:05:57.609 --> 04:05:59.611
THIS COMMITTEE WHERE I THINK

04:05:59.678 --> 04:06:01.346
THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR

04:06:01.413 --> 04:06:06.985
BETTER. DATA COLLECTION BY IT

04:06:07.052 --> 04:06:07.786
IS A STRUCTURE ALL ISSUE IN OUR

04:06:07.853 --> 04:06:09.588
HELL CARE SO- AND ASSIST X. AND

04:06:09.654 --> 04:06:11.089
BECAUSE HARM IN A CALL HARM.

04:06:11.156 --> 04:06:15.093
DURING THE SPEND. ON SAUDI HI I

04:06:15.160 --> 04:06:17.062
SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK IT'S

04:06:17.129 --> 04:06:19.464
IMPORTANT INFORMATION I'M GLAD

04:06:19.531 --> 04:06:21.466
THAT THE ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY

04:06:21.533 --> 04:06:23.602
DISCLOSURE WORKED OUT THIS DATA

04:06:23.668 --> 04:06:25.504
WILL STILL BE AVAILABLE TO

04:06:25.570 --> 04:06:27.339
HEALTH OFFICIALS TO.

04:06:27.405 --> 04:06:29.040
RESEARCHERS AND I AGREE WITH

04:06:29.107 --> 04:06:30.408
THE AUTHOR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

04:06:30.475 --> 04:06:31.676
SURE THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO GET

04:06:31.743 --> 04:06:34.346
AGGREGATED DATA- CAL IN A WAY

04:06:34.412 --> 04:06:37.415
THAT IS USABLE- TO- TO REALLY

04:06:37.482 --> 04:06:38.884
HELP PEOPLE AND TO AND TO FOCUS

04:06:38.950 --> 04:06:41.219
RESOURCES. BUT BOY DO WE HAVE A

04:06:41.286 --> 04:06:44.523
LOT OF WORK TO DO BECAUSE IT'S

04:06:44.589 --> 04:06:45.757
A COMPLETE MESS I'LL BE HONEST.

04:06:45.824 --> 04:06:48.560

THIS BILL FORWARD AND I KNOW

04:06:58.770 --> 04:07:01.106
THIS- PROBABLY WAS A TOUGH

04:07:01.173 --> 04:07:04.276
PUSH- GIVEN ALL THE CHANGES ARE

04:07:04.342 --> 04:07:06.645

PERHAPS THEY HAVE SOME INPUT-

04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:39.511
NOW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:07:39.578 --> 04:07:41.213

HEAR IT HASN'T CHANGED HER MIND

04:07:54.059 --> 04:07:55.994
OR ARE THEY NOW OKAY WITH THAT

04:07:56.061 --> 04:07:57.963

TRYING TO STAND IN CRAFTING

04:08:13.278 --> 04:08:16.248
THESE AMENDMENTS- WE DID WE

04:08:16.314 --> 04:08:19.317
