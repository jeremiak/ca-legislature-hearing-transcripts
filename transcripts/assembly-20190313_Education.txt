YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TODAY IT IS MY HONOR. TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. THREE THIRTY ONE ETHNIC STUDIES BILL. AND WITH ME THIS MORNING IS DOCTOR ALBERT COME IDEAL FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY. AND WE ARE ALSO EXPECTING OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION -- TONY THURMOND [inaudible] ETHNIC STUDIES. IN THE CURRICULUM THAT IT REPRESENTS AND THE CURRICULUM THAT IT IT WILL INCLUDE. IS SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH NEEDED IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AS A ETHNIC STUDIES CHICANO STUDIES TEACHER AT POLY HIGH SCHOOL. I SAW FIRST HAND. THE POWER OF THE CURRICULUM THAT INCLUDES STUDENTS BACKGROUND STUDENTS HISTORY AND STUDENTS CULTURE. WHEN WE LOOK AT WAYS OF IMPROVING PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION? WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AT EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT GAP? AND WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO REMEDY THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE DISCIPLINEAND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THE THOSE ARE ONE WAY OF GOING ABOUT TRYING. TO A THE CULTURE OF EDUCATION. BUT ANOTHER WAY OF CHANGING THE CULTURE OF EDUCATION IS LOOKING AT WHAT IS TAUGHT. WHAT IS TAUGHT WHAT IS INCLUDED? AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED. WHEN I WENT THROUGH -- PUBLIC -- MY EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM AT UC RIVERSIDE. I LEARNED ABOUT THE HIDDEN CURRICULUM. AND THAT THAT IS WHAT IS IMPLIED OR WOULD STUDENTS LEARN. A NOT WHAT IS IN THE TEXTBOOK BUT WHAT THE WAY THEY ARE PRESENTED WITH MATERIAL A WHAT IS VALUED AND WHAT IS NOT VALUED. AND TOO LONG FOR TOO LONG. IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS -- WHEN WE DO NOT INCLUDE STUDENTS CULTURE STUDENTS HISTORY? STUDENTS BACKGROUND WHERE THEY COME FROM THE STORIES OF THEIR FAMILIES. WE IMPLICITLY SEND A MESSAGE THAT THAT CULTURE THAT HISTORY IS NOT A VALUE. BECAUSE IT IS NOT IN THE CURRICULUM IT IS NOT TAUGHT. WHEN I WAS TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES CHICANO STUDIES AT POLY HIGH SCHOOL I I HAD A STUDENT IN MY CLASS WHO WENT TO OUR HISTORY TEACHER? SHE WENT OUR HISTORY TEACHER AND SHE ASKED HER HISTORY TEACHER ABOUT THE NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT WALK OUT. IN EAST LA OF THE STUDENTS. AND APPARENTLY THAT US HISTORY TEACHER WAS NOT AWARE OF IT. SO IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE US HISTORY TEACHER I TOLD HER THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. WE NEED TO CHANGE ¬çT TO CHANGE THAT KIND OF EDUCATION. I LEARNED IN MY ETHNIC STUDIES CLASS THAT -- WE DRAW CIRCLES THAT WE DRAW CIRCLES TO INCLUDE OR TO EXCLUDE PEOPLE. THAT WE CAN DRAW THE CIRCLE BRINGING PEOPLE IN. OR WE CAN DRAW THE CIRCLE TO KEEP PEOPLE WE TEACH DOES THAT. IF WE DRAW THE CIRCLE TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WE WILL DRAW THE CIRCLE TO INCLUDE THIS CURRICULA. CURRICULUM IS BEING DEVELOPED NOW. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THAT I AND MANY. OF MY COLLEAGUES ONE IS C. AS A COLLEGE GRADUATION REQUIREMENT MOVING FORWARD. DISCIPLINE. SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BECAME A DISCIPLINE IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WHEN THE STUDENTS AND FACULTY MEMBERS THE SAN FRANCISCO STATE WALKED OUT AND DEMANDED. THAT THAT KIND OF CURRICULA BEING COLLUDED -- AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE -- AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS LOOKING BEHIND ME I THOUGHT MAYBE -- OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IT COME BUT HE'S NOT HERE YET. WHEN HE COMES IN ALL OF THAT THANK YOU FOR IT? THANK YOU. SO FOR THE LAST SO THAT THE CURRICULUM. IT HAS EXISTED. IT IS BEEN TAUGHT. BUT WE'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THAT CORRECT THEM TO BE INCLUDED IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF OF BEING A LEADER. BEING A LEADER IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT OTHER STATES ARE AHEAD OF US IN CALLING FOR ETHNIC STUDIES STATES LIKE VERMONT [inaudible] CONNECTICUT WASHINGTON. INDIANA HAVE ALL CALLED FOR ETHNIC STUDIES. STATE IN THE NATION. OUR STUDENTS DESERVE TO LEARN ABOUT THEIR PAST THEIR CULTURE THEIR HISTORY. ETHNIC STUDY WILL NOT SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS. BUT I THINK ETHNIC STUDIES IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THAT THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AT NOR OF HIGH SCHOOL IN OH HI. PORT NEWPORT HIGH SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL IN NEWPORT WERE STUDENTS CREATED SWASTIKAS OUT OF PAPER CUPS. SO THAT THINGS LIKE THAT WON'T HAPPEN AS OFTEN. SO I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME -- PROFESSOR ALBERT COME IDEA A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS THE AUTHOR OF CHICANOS IN A CHANGING SOCIETY PAST PRESIDENT. OF THE AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. AND YOUR TO PRESENT IN SUPPORT OF ETHNIC STUDIES DOCTOR COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JOIN YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES THAT THIS MORNING IN SUPPORT OF AB. THREE THIRTY ONE I'VE HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS -- OF PARTICIPATING STANFORD UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT HISTORY WITH TO CHARTER HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE BAY AREA OF SAN FRANCISCO BERRIES PAULA ALL TO ACADEMY HIGH END OF RELATIVELY NEW CHARTER SCHOOL. IN SAN JOSE LUIS FATHERS LEADERSHIP ACADEMY OF DEVELOPING AND INSTITUTING AN ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM IN THIS CASE MEXICAN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND FROM THAT UNIQUE EXPERIENCE. THE TRANSFORMATIVE IMPACT THAT IT'S HAD ON STUDENTS THAT THESE TWO HIGH SCHOOLS -- IT IS CLEAR TO ME AND SO MANY OF THE TEACHERS INVOLVED IN THE THE OPERATIONAL SESSION INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF THIS CURRICULUM. THAT IT HIS CENTER TRAJECTORY OF FOR THESE STUDENTS TO EXCEL. IN THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS UP AND TOWARDS COLLEGE READINESS. NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE ETHNIC STUDIES RELATED CURRICULA LOAN IS IS A REASON FOR A TRAJECTORY TOWARDS HIGHER EDUCATION FOR PARTICULARLY AT YOUTH. RISK BUT IT'S PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BRINGING A CRITICAL SENSIBILITY. BY AN APPRECIATION FOR SO RICK IN THE STUDENTS HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED SO WHAT THESE TWO HIGH SCHOOLS -- SPECIALLY LOUISE WELL THIS LEADERSHIP ACADEMY NINTH GRADERS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE THIS COURSE WHICH WE DEVELOPED TOGETHER AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS. AND IN IN THAT SCHOOL THE END AND PUTTING IN A LARGER CONTEXT ABOUT SCHOOL READINESS AND THE THE IMPACT IT HAS ON ENERGIZING THEIR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE THESE HIGH SCHOOLS. ABOUT 27% OF LATINO STUDENTS ENTER FOUR YEAR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA 75% OF THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS LAST JUNE FROM LOUISE FALL THERE'S LEADERSHIP ACADEMY. HAVE NOW ENTERED FOUR YEAR -- COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AND THERE ARE MANY TESTIMONIES THAT THEY'VE GIVEN BACK TO US AND IN THEIR STATEMENTS OF ADMISSION TO COLLEGE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES OF THE VALUE THE IMPACT OF HAVING THAT EXPOSURE TO THAT CURRICULUM. EARLY ON THAT ESTABLISH A BASIS FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH EDUCATION ESPECIALLY SOCIAL STUDIES. SO IT'S BEEN A HEART WARMING AND AND IN IN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO SEE THE WAY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS CAN TAKE THIS CURRICULUM AND INCORPORATED INTO THEIR TRAJECTORIES FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- I THE SUPER TEN HASN'T SHOWN UP BUT IF HE DOES SHOW UP. WE WILL -- WE WILL CERTAINLY BRING THEM FORWARD MISTER MEDINA PORT. DID YOU WANNA YEAH I I I JUST.

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUBJECTS IN WHICH COURSES ARE REQUIRED FOR GRADUATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL BY THE STATE OR OF APPLICABLE BY THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY. OR CHARTER SCHOOL.

FOR COURSES TAUGHT THROUGH ANOTHER SUBJECT PUPILS COMPLETING THE COURSE SHALL ALSO OCCUR CREDIT FOR THE COURSE WORK IN THE SUBJECT.

SEEING NO OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. I ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COULD YOU ALSO SHARE WITH YOU AYE MR ANY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PASSION. YOUR EXPERIENCE FIRST RIGHT AND YOUR PASSION ON THIS ISSUE -- YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS AWHILE SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU TODAY -- SUNDAY IS ST PATRICK'S DAY SO I HOPE YOU'LL REMEMBER THE CENTURY COS ON SUNDAY RIGHT. RIGHT FORGET RIGHT ON SO OF YOU KNOW MAKE MAINLY YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS ARE MAINLY LATINO THERE SO I THINK THE MORE THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT THEMSELVES. AND THE OTHER STUDENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES IS ONLY A GOOD THING -- TO GIVE THEM YOU KNOW SOME PRIDE FOR SURE -- BUT ALSO BELIEVE NO WE KNOW WHERE THEY FIT IN THE WORLD SO THANK YOU FOR FOR FOR FOR TODAY BOTH OF YOU BUT THE WITH THAT I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER. A DOCUMENT YES I SORRY I WAS LATE TIED UP IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE BUT I AM PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS ON THIS BILL WITH MOST MEDINA. WHO HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME WORKING ON IT -- AS MOST OF YOU KNOW I SPENT FORTY YEARS TEACHING ETHNIC STUDIES AT SENEGAL STATE UNIVERSITY IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE DEPARTMENT. AND ONE OF THINGS THAT ALWAYS STRUCK ME WAS THAT -- WHEN STUDENTS CAME INTO THE DEPARTMENT FOR WHATEVER REASON THROUGH WHATEVER MEANS -- THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT NOT ONLY THEIR OWN HISTORY BOOK ABOUT THE HISTORY THE PEOPLE WHO SAT IN THE ROOM WITH THEM WE WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THEM. AND SO I ALWAYS THEY ALWAYS FELT SOMEHOW ANOTHER THEY HAD BEEN BETRAYED BY LAW SO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY GOT TO THE UNIVERSITY AND IT TOOK AN ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE AND THEY DISCOVER THEY LACK SO MUCH INFORMATION. AND THESE WERE CONSIDERED OUR BEST AND BRIGHTEST STUDENTS JUST AS EARLIER WHY DID WE KNOW THIS WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT. AND AND IT WAS REALLY CLEAR THAT WE IF THAT WOULD REALLY GOING TO DEAL WITH EDUCATION EVEN AT THE UPPER LEVEL WITH BEGIN IT EARLY SO THE YOUNG PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT. AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT I DID TEACH AN EPIC STUDIES COURSE OF IN ON I AFER SCHOOL AT ONE OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- AND WAS INTERESTING HOW MANY STUDENTS CAME WITHOUT CREDIT AFTER SCHOOL FOR A BLACK HISTORY COURSE. WHO WANTED TO KNOW THE MATERIAL WHOSE BEHAVIOR CHANGED IMMENSELY AS A RESULT OF OF KNOWING THE MATERIAL IN TERMS OF THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THEIR OTHER CLASSES? BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AMAZING TO ME THAT THESE YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWED UP. AFTER SCHOOL THEY HAD A HALF DAY IN THE TO GO HOME THEY SHOWED UP REGULARLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR COURSE TO LEARN ABOUT BLACK HISTORY. AND SO AND IT WAS NOT ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS THAT WILL ALSO ASIAN AND LATINO STUDENTS WHO CAME TO THAT COURSE AS WELL SO I THINK THE IDEA OF STUDENTS WANTING TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE YOU KNOW HAVING SPENT ALL MY YEARS IN UNIVERSITY. AND NOT STUDYING ETHNIC STUDIES AT ALL UNTIL I BECAME A GROUP PHD STUDENT -- THAT YOU FEEL THAT THERE'S A SENSE OF LOSS YOU KNOW THAT YOU COULD HAVE MAYBE DO WHO KNOWS WHAT YOUR LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE. IF YOU WOULD HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF BUT EQUALLY IMPORTANT EVEN THOUGH AS MUCH AS I KNOW ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY I STILL FEEL AN ADEQUATE IN TERMS OF KNOWING MORE ABOUT LATINO HISTORY. AND I'M CONSTANTLY READING BOOKS AND TRYING TO IF IT MORE KLAY TEACHING ART BUT EVERYBODY THAT'S A HAS BEEN A PART IN AMERICAN HISTORY IT MAKES AND STRONGER IT MAKES MORE RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER. AND IT JUST ENHANCES OUR LIFE SIGNS I'M PLEASE WITH THIS IT'S BEEN FIFTY YEARS SINCE AN ETHNIC STUDIES WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE BLACK STUDIES THEY BEGIN THE MOVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND IS TAKEN FIFTY YEARS FOR US TO HOPEFULLY GET TO THIS POINT WHERE WE REALLY GOING TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY IN TERMS OF PART OF THE RIGHT THE CURRICULA TEACHING K.. TWELVE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSED MEDINA FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER IN FACT MY OLDEST BROTHER WENT ALONG TO WE WENT TO SAN DIEGO STATE AND TOOK AN IRISH HISTORY COURSE THERE. ON OVER THE ETHNIC STUDIES I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. BUT AFTER THAT I KNOW MY FAMILY BECAME MORE AND TURN INTO WHETHER WITH OUR HISTORY FOR SURE IN LONG BEACH UNIFIED DOES A GREAT JOB. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS GOING ON ACROSS THE STATE THEY DO THEY ARE ACTUALLY OFFER THESE JUST CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT. SO YOU CAN GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL WAS SIX UNITS IN ETHNIC STUDIES. AND I THINK THEY ACTUALLY GO ON THE WEEKENDS IT'S NOT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE LONG BEACH STATE CAMPUS WHICH I DO SEE AS A POSITIVE GETTING KIDS UNDER THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS. SO THIS IS HAPPENING ACROSS OUR STATE NOW ALBEIT NOT EVERYWHERE AND THAT THAT'S YOUR GOAL TODAY. IF I MAY CLOSE THE QUESTION UP. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS BILL IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND IT IS SO TIMELY IN FACT OVERDUE I'M REALLY PROUD TO REPRESENT A DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE DOZENS OF NATIVE CULTURES AND VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN. TO LEARN THEIR OWN NATIVE HISTORIES AND FOR ALL STUDENTS TO LEARN THEIR PLACE IN OUR NEW MORE GLOBAL CLIMATE SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE AUTHORED THIS THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT ALL. OF THE IMMENSELY TALENTED SOCIAL STUDIES TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE COME UP WITH TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN THANK YOU THANK YOU. IF I MAY CLOSE MR. YEAH I YOU KNOW LET LET US ESTABLISH A QUORUM WE'VE GOT EVERYBODY HERE AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU CLOSE. DO SO I I DO WANT TO CALL THE FULL COMMITTEE TO ORDER BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE A QUORUM PLEASE THIS CALL THE ROLL. O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL HERE. KILEY. KILEY HERE KALRA [inaudible] MCCARTY. MCCARTY HERE SMITH. SMITH HERE WEBER [inaudible] WEBER HERE. WE DO HAVE A ONE THE COURT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITHOUT I'M SORRY CLOSE MISTER YEAH. BUT THANK YOU TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES FOR A OTHER SUPPORT. THIS MORNING. BEFORE I CAME TO THE CAPITOL I OPENED UP. OF JOAN DIDION SLOUCHING TO BETHLEHEM AND SHE WRITES ABOUT SUTTER'S MILL. JUST A FEW MILES FROM HERE. AND SHE WRITES ABOUT HOW SUTTER MILL AND THE FOUNDING OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THAT EVENT WAS SEEN AS THE FOUNDING OF CALIFORNIA. AND IF THAT IS THE POINT OF VIEW OF HISTORY IT IT IT ELIMINATES OR SO MUCH. THAT ALREADY EXISTED BEFORE -- THE THE PIONEERS CAME TO CALIFORNIA THE NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY THAT MISS SMITH REFERRED TO THE SPANISH HISTORY. THE MEXICAN HISTORY OF THE STATE-OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO TOO OFTEN I THINK BUT THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN TAUGHT. AS A MOVEMENT FROM. FROM EAST TO WEST. THE THE HISTORY THE RICHEST HISTORY OF WHAT CAME BEFORE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT. OF WHEN WE THINK OF THE FORTY NINERS WE THINK OF ONLY ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THAT LEAVES OUT THE THE ASIAN AMERICANS THAT ALSO WE'RE HERE. SO I'M VERY HAPPY -- THAT WE'RE MOVING THIS BILL FOR AS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE WITH THAT -- WE NEED A MOTION.

WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GO TO BACK TO MISTER MEDINA -- FILE ITEM NUMBER TWELVE FILE NUMBER [inaudible] TWELVE AB. FOUR TWENTY EIGHT YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY MR MEDINA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB ASSEMBLY BILL TWO EIGHTY FOUR WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FUNDING FOR THE EQUALIZATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. FUNDING RATES FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL SERVICES AND FOR HIGH COST PLACEMENTS. OUR STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS DESERVE HIGH QUALITY OF EDUCATION WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. BUT OUR CURRENTS BUDGET SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEM. PRESENTS BARRIERS WHERE THEY SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITIES. FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES HAVE VARIED CONSIDERABLY. WITHOUT ANY RATIONALE. SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH THESE INEQUITIES FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES. AND ADDRESSING THEM IS SIMPLE MATTER OF FAIRNESS. FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL ALSO PRESENTS A BARRIER WHERE THERE SHOULD BE OPPORTUNITY. AT A CRITICAL TIME IN CHILDREN'S LIVES CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A FREE AND APPROPRIATE PUBLIC IT EDUCATION. TO PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. BUT IN SPITE OF THIS MANDATE NO STATE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THIS IS SHORT SIGHTED BECAUSE EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOLERS IS AN EXCELLENT INVESTMENT. FINALLY THE BILL PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WITH MORE SEVERE DISABILITIES. WHEN OUR CURRENT SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM WAS ESTABLISHED WE HAD SUPPORT BUT IT WAS ELIMINATED DURING THE RECESSION? LEAVING SCHOOLS WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT HIGHER COSTS PLACEMENTS. ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS BILL ARE COMMONSENSE INVESTMENTS IN FAIRNESS AND QUALITY FOR OUR VALUED STUDENTS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT IS CAROL MILLS FROM THE FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION. AND JENNIFER BAKER FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. GOOD MORNING CAROL MILLS BOARD MEMBER IT FRESNO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THANK YOU FOR HEARING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. BRIEFLY MY DISTRICT HAS OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS AND OVER NINE THOUSAND OF THOSE STUDENTS QUALIFY FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. WE HAVE 88% OF OUR STUDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY. FRESNO UNIFIED OFFERS EVERY SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM TO SERVE ALL IDENTIFIED DISABILITIES AND THAT INCLUDES TWO SCHOOLS THAT SERVE JUST THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT. AND WE HAVE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MEDICALLY FRAGILE STUDENTS. OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATE FROM THE STATE IS FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN DOLLARS PER STUDENT. THERE ARE SIXTY FOUR CELEBUZZ THAT GET MORE MONEY AS MUCH AS NINE HUNDRED PER STUDENT. THERE ARE SIXTY SIX THAT GET LESS. AS LITTLE AS FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT AND THERE IS NO RATIONAL BASIS FOR THE DISPARITY. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED CALL WAS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION IT HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE INCREASED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR THE STUDENTS. AND OUR COUNTRY LOCAL CONTRIBUTIONS SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS AN ENCROACHMENT HAS TRIPLED OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS. AND THE TWENTY THIRD TWELVE TWENTY THIRD. FRESNO IS CUT LOCAL CONTRIBUTION WAS TWENTY FOUR MILLION. THIS YEAR IN THE SEVENTY ONE MILLION. PART OF THE INCREASE IN THE CONTRIBUTION IS TO SERVE PRESCHOOLERS WE ARE MANDATED TO SERVE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES. BUT THERE IS NO STATE FUNDING FOR THIS MANDATE. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE STATE WIDE IN STUDENTS IDENTIFIED AS BEING ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM. IT HAS JUMPED FROM SINGLE DIGITS TO DOUBLE DIGITS AROUND 13%. WE ALSO CHARGE WAS SERVING PLACEMENT AND THAT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. A SPECIALIZED PLACEMENT THAT IS RESIDENTIAL. CAN COSTA DISTRICT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER STUDENT. FRESNO HAS SIX STUDENTS IN THAT TYPE OF PLACEMENT. WE HAVE. THIRTY STUDENTS IN SPECIAL PLACEMENTS THAT COST IS FIFTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. AND THE SMALLER DISTRICTS HAVE THESE EXPENSES AS WELL IT TOTALLY HAPPENS THEIR BUDGET. SO WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI. FOR TWENTY EIGHT GOOD MORNING AT CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON MY NAME IS JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. ULTIMATELY THIS SYSTEMIC LACK OF FISCAL SUPPORT FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION HAS LED TO A REDUCTION IN THE SUPPORT SERVICES ARE TEACHERS NEEDS SUCH AS COACHING AND MENTORING ALSO THE TIME AND RESOURCES TO BUILD A LONG STROKE. L√† STRONG LOCAL PROGRAM SOME OF OUR TEACHERS FACE REGULAR TURN OVER WITH AN AVERAGE OF THREE YEARS TO SEIZE TEACHING ASSIGNMENTS ARE CHALLENGING. GAPS IN RESOURCES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY. RECENTLY DUBLIN WAS GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF A NEW CURRICULAR ADOPTION ONE OF OUR TEACHERS KNEW SHE NEEDED SUPPLEMENTAL RESOURCES TO ENSURE HER STUDENTS HAD ACCESS TO STANDARDS ALIGNED INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS. BUT THOSE SUBMIT RESOURCES WERE NOT PART OF A PILOT HER DISTRICT WAS USING WHAT SHE FOUND WAS SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS ORDERING NEW MATERIALS FROM THE APPROVED ADOPTION IS EXPENSIVE. WHILE GENERAL EDUCATION TEACHERS RECEIVE THE CLASS SAID IN A TEACHER'S ASSISTANT ADDITION AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER SHE NEEDS MULTIPLE GRADE LEVELS OF BOTH THE TEACHER AND STUDENT RESOURCES. THE COST OF A GENERAL EDUCATIONS TEACHER COUNTED FOR BUT THE COMPLEX COSTA SPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS ARE OFTEN NOT FACTORED INTO FINAL BILLS. EFFORTS TOWARDS FULL OF INCLUSION ADDITIONALLY AT ALL LEVELS GENERATES MORE CHALLENGES TO ADDRESS THE CHRONIC CAPS IN THE FUNDING NEEDED TO ENSURE IT IS DONE SUCCESSFULLY. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT ALL TEACHERS ARE TRAINED IN THE VARIOUS DISABILITIES IN THE SUPPORTS NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BUT HOW CAN YOU TREAT A TEACHER WHO ALREADY HAS A CASELOAD OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS STUDENT CONTRACTS DAILY. HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ARE MET WITHOUT THE TIME TRAINING A STAFFING CURRICULAR RESOURCES TO DO SO? TEACHERS HAVE LITTLE TRAINING TIME FOR TRAINING AND MINIMAL IF ANY RESOURCES OR SET ASIDE FOR TEACHER DRIVEN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS WHY THE NEED FOR A BEFORE TWENTY IS SO CRITICAL. ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB FOR TWENTY EIGHT AND TO HELP FILL THE FISCAL GAP OR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU -- OTHERS IN SUPPORT. STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT ONCE AGAIN I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS CRITICALLY TIMELY BILL I'M HAVING JUST FINISHED NINE YEARS ON A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD AND KNOWING THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING. NOT ONLY A SIMPLE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM BUT A SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF ISSUES -- AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS THAT THIS COULDN'T BE MORE TIMELY AN ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- ON BEHALF OF THE THE SELF AS THAT I REPRESENT ALONE THERE'S NEARLY TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT CAN BE ALLOCATED TO SPECIAL ED SERVICES. AND SO I I DO APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS I YOU HAVE I'M SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED SPECIAL EDUCATION AT THE PRESCHOOL LEVEL BECAUSE OF WHAT MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT REALIZE IS THAT. IF WE ENGAGE THE SPECIAL ED STUDENT POPULATION AND THEIR FAMILIES AT THE PRESCHOOL LEVEL AND START WITH INTERVENTION SERVICES AND SUPPORTS AS EARLY AS THAT AGE THERE ARE GREAT SUCCESSES TO BE HAD AND THEY'RE GREAT COSTS. TO BE SAVED ALONG THE CONTINUING PATH OF THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION JOURNEY SO INCLUDING NOT WAS -- REALLY WISE ON YOUR BEHALF AND I I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DID THAT THANK YOU. I STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY THANK YOU I'M OF THE BILL FIRST BILLS BEEN MOVED IN SPEND SECONDED BY MISS SMITH. YES AND THEN I I ALSO AND AND STRONG SUPPORTER THIS I KNOW WE HAD A HEARING ON THIS. FOR THOSE OF US LAST YEAR. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF SPECIAL ANSWERS THERE IS DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT -- WE HOW WE GOT TO SPENDING SO MUCH OF OUR DISCUSSION MAN SPECIAL ED BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS AND THIS IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE. AND EQUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE WAY. TO BOOST AT SPECIAL LET FUNDING THAT THAT HELPS DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY WE SAW. THE LINE OUT THE DOOR I HEARING HERE IN MY STOCK -- ROUGHLY 10215% OF THE POPULATION OUR SPECIAL ED IDENTIFIED STUDENTS BUT IT REPRESENTS OVER THAT THEY SPENT AND SO. IT'S IN IT'S AN INCREASED COST AND I CONCUR THAT IF YOU HAVE -- EARLY INTERVENTIONS AND SCREENINGS AND AND START EARLIER WE CAN PREVENT -- SOME OF THE COST LATER DOWN THE ROAD BUT THE REALITY IS SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. ARE STRAPPED WITH. RETIREMENT COSTS -- CERTAINLY THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN A LABOR COSTS YOU KNOW ADEQUATELY -- PAYING THEIR THEIR WORKFORCE AND SPECIAL ED SO THIS IS ONE OF THAT THE DRIVERS AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE -- RECONCILING IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT THIS IS THE WAY WE OUGHT TO BE SPENDING THE MONEY PUT FORTH IN THE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET SO.

THEN THAT WOULD BE A BETTER SELLING POINT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TO TO TO GET A BETTER USE OF THEIR DOLLARS TO ADOPT SOCIAL WORKERS INTO AN ORDINARY. THING THAT THEY DO WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT HIRING. WE KNOW WE'VE GIVEN SCHOOL DISTRICT A LOT MORE LEEWAY TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO HIRE WHAT KIND OF POSITIONS BASED ON THEIR OWN -- THEIR OWN NEEDS BUT WE FEEL LIKE WE SELLING POINT -- SO WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A A GOOD WAY TO GET SOCIAL WORKERS INTO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

LIVING IN A SINGLE PARENT FAMILY AND PARENTS WITH LITTLE EDUCATION OR HEALTH PROBLEMS ABOUT 19% OR ONE IN. FIVE I'M OF ALL CHILDREN SEEM BY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS HAVE BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS BUT FEW RECEIVE HELP IN FACT FEWER THAN ONE INFIVE NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ACTUALLY RECEIVE THEM ADDITIONALLY ONE OF FIVE CHILDREN IN THE U. S. LIVE IN POVERTY. IN THE SCHOOL SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS HELP TEACHERS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES OVERCOME BARRIERS TO LEARNING SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS ARE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES THAT PROMOTE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. AND BEHAVIORAL ADJUSTMENT IN SCHOOL AND IN SOCIETY SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS ALSO HELP CONNECT STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO CRITICAL SUPPORT SUCH AS FOOD AND SHELTER. IN ADDITION SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS GET CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND ANGER MANAGEMENT HELPING STUDENTS LEARN SOCIAL SKILLS AND HELP PREVENT PULLING BEHAVIOR. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SO SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS IN THE SCHOOLS OF FOR EXAMPLE LOCALLY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FOLSOM CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ONLY HAD TO SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKERS FOR NINETEEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU ANY OTHER AND IT ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISS SMITH. LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PILOT PROGRAM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE TRIED IN THE DISTRICT THAT I JUST LEFT AND FOR MANY FAMILIES.

WELL NOW MOVES -- TO MR OBERNOLTE. WHO'S BEEN VERY PATIENT -- IS HE HAS AB TWENTY EIGHT WHICH IS FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE MISTER OBERNOLTE. YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE THERE IS A CRITICAL NEED FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE EDUCATION AND THE SO CALLED STEM FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA THOSE BEING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS. IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS GROWTH IN JOBS WITHIN THOSE FIELDS WILL BE OVER OF THE NEW JOBS CREATED IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE IN THE STEM FIELDS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB A PROPERLY PREPARING STUDENTS TO ENTER THOSE FIELDS IN FACT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES. THAT OVER TWICE AS MANY NEW JOBS WERE AVAILABLE IN THOSE FIELDS AS THERE WERE UNEMPLOYED WORKERS IN THOSE FIELDS LOOKING FOR JOBS. SO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF PREPARING STUDENTS FOR THOSE FIELDS THIS BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT IS AN EFFORT TO DO JUST THAT. THIS WOULD CREATE A STEM A SEAL FOR HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMAS IN AN EFFORT TO INCENTIVIZE STUDENTS TO ENTER INTO STUDIES IN THOSE FIELDS. SO ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS SEAL WOULD BE FIRST OF ALL -- OPT IN ON PART OF THE SCHOOL TO ON THEIR OWN WHETHER NOT TO PARTICIPATE BUT A STUDENT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TO TAKE FOUR YEARS OF SCIENCE. FOUR YEARS OF MATHEMATICS ONE OF WHICH CAN BE A COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ACHIEVE CERTAIN BENCHMARKS IN THOSE FIELDS A MINIMUM OF THREE POINT OH GPA IN THOSE CLASSES -- AND THEN PROVE PROFICIENCY IN THOSE FIELDS ON GRADUATION THROUGH EITHER A ON SAT SUBJECT SCORE AN AP TEST SCORE SEVERAL OTHER -- METHODOLOGIES FOR DEMONSTRATING PROFICIENCY SO ARE MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK AND THE WORK WITH US ON THIS BILL AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TO THE COMMITTEE SUPPORT ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU -- YOUR WITNESS. ERICA HOFFMAN ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WE SEE THIS BILL AS A WAY TO PROVIDE STUDENTS. I GUESS WITH AN INCENTIVE WITH -- A A TANGIBLE SHOWING THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCEED IN THE STEM PROGRAM THEY'VE CHOSEN THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL -- IT WOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH AN ABILITY TO AND TO BE ABLE TO MARKET THEMSELVES POTENTIALLY TO FOR THEIR YOU KNOW FUTURE EMPLOYERS MAYBE EVEN THROUGH THE COLLEGE TRACK.

KATHY RAVEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE PTA AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION -- CENA OPPOSITION TO THE BILL OVER IMPACTS THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THE SPENT. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM THANK YOU OUR COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I DO THINK IT IS ESSENTIAL -- TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS THE NEW REALITY WITH OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AND HAVING SOMETHING THAT INSPIRES STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR STEM PROGRAMS -- REGARDLESS HOW WE GET THERE -- IS WORTH LOOKING AT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IN THINKING ABOUT THIS MEASURE THAT WAS IT I KNOW THAT WE STILL HAVE A NUMBER OF DISTRICT STATE WIDE WHERE. THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF THE COURSES REQUIRED TO GET THE SEAL MAY NOT BE READILY OR EASILY AVAILABLE COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE PLEASE CERTAINLY THAT WAS THIS IS OUR SECOND YEAR TRYING TO GET THIS BILL THROUGH A LAST YEAR WAS HELD IN APPROPRIATIONS AND I THINK WE HAVE. A PATH THROUGH THE COMMITTEE NOW. THIS COMMITTEE HAD THAT CONCERN WITH THE BILL LAST YEAR AND A TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS WE TOOK AMENDMENTS LAST YEAR THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TO ADOPT CERTAIN FINDINGS BEFORE THE SEAL WAS CREATED AND AMONG THOSE FINDINGS. ARE FINDING THAT ALL STUDENTS TO CALIFORNIA HAD REASONABLY EQUAL ACCESS TO THAT SEAL. SO. I'M HOPING THAT THAT ADDRESSES THE CONCERN BUT ALSO IN A LARGER SENSE -- THE PURPOSE OF THE SEAL IS TO INCENTIVIZE NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT ALSO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE THIS CURRICULUM AVAILABLE. ANSWER HOPING THAT THE SEAL SHEDS LITTLE MAYBE THOSE CLASSES ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND THEN MOTIVATES THEM TO MOVE TOWARDS GETTING THOSE CLASSES AVAILABLE SO THAT ALL STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THEM. THANK YOU -- A SINGLE FOR THE COMMON FOR THE COMMITTEE TO EMOTION. MOVE TO QUE MOVED SECONDED ALL SECOND -- PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS THE PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS O'DONNELL.

DISTRICT AND CHAU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR O'DONNELL IN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. MY NAME IS MICHELLE JOHN AND I AM THE SUPERINTENDENT FOR PARADISE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK AT LAST MONTH'S INFORMATIONAL HEARING REGARDING THE IMPACT OF CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES ON PUBLIC SCHOOLS. IT WAS AT THAT HEARING THAT I LAID OUT THE OVERWHELMING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR DISTRICT FACE. IT WAS ALSO AT THAT HEARING WERE EXPLAINED. AT THE COMMITTEES THE NEED FOR LONG TERM FINANCIAL SOLUTION TO PROVIDE STABILITY AND SUPPORT% FOR OUR STUDENTS AND STAFF. AS YOU KNOW THE CAMPFIRE WAS THE MOST DEADLY AND DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY. DEVASTATING OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND SCHOOL SYSTEM. PARADISE IS RESILIENT AND STRONG COMMUNITY BUT THE TRUTH IS IS THAT IT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO REBUILD THE TOWN. AND WITHOUT THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND SUPPORT. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND FAMILIES WITH WHAT THEY NEED. LAST OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ARE STUDENT ROMA WAS AT THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED FAST FORWARD TO TODAY THAT PUTS OUR MOMENT AT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED HALF OF THE STUDENTS HAVE LEFT THE SCHOOLS. AND THE COMMUNITY AS A RESULT CAN'T FIRE. ADDITIONALLY OUR PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THERE MOMENT IS LIKELY CONTINUE TO DROP TO TWELVE HUNDRED OR SO STUDENTS WHEN WE RETURN TO PARADISE. FOR THIS REASON I'M HERE TODAY ASKING YOU TO PLEASE SUPPORT ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER'S A. B. TWO NINETY SEVEN BILL. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT OUR DISTRICT MAINTAINS THE PRE FIRE FUNDING LEVEL. TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE KEEPING THIS FINANCIALLY SOLVENT MH AND ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE SMALL BIT OF NORMALCY AND A STATE. AND A STABLE DISTRICT PROVIDES. TO BOTH ITS STUDENTS AND ITS STAFF. THE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR CURRENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE FOR TEACHER SALARIES WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY DISINCENTIVES FOR STAFF TO STATE. PARADISE IS HURT ME UP WE KNOW THAT THIS REBUILD WILL TAKE LONGER THAN THE YEARS. POSTED THIS LEGISLATION WE HOPE TO CONTINUE A CONVERSATION FOR A MULTI YEAR EIGHTY A RAMP DOWN. PERIOD FOLLOWING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. WAS SUCH AN AND PRESENT PRESIDENT OF FIRE WE THINK IT AND PRESIDENTE RECOVERY PLAN SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND ONCE AGAIN URGE A YES VOTE ON AB THANK NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING CHAIR O'DONNELL AND AM EDUCATION COMMITTEE MET MEMBERS MY NAME IS GRETCHEN PACK AND I'M A TEACHER WITH THE PARADISE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I WILL TRY TO HOLD IT TOGETHER. SIX I'M I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PARADISE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WHO'S PASSING WILL PROVIDE US WITH AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF FISCAL READ. FISCAL RELIEF DURING THE REBUILDING PROCESS FOLLOWING THE NOVEMBER EIGHTH CAMPFIRE. GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE REBUILDING EFFORTS IN CHALLENGES IN SANTA ROSA AND READING WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE CURRENT THREE YEARS OF FUNDING WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. I WISH I HAD THE TIME TO DETAIL WHAT MAKES OUR SCHOOLS SO SPECIAL BUT THE MAIN INGREDIENTS. OUR TEACHERS SUPPORT STAFF AND STUDENTS. TEACHERS SAY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS THAT DAY. THEY QUICKLY AND CALMLY HELPED EVACUATE. OVER 90% OF OUR SCHOOL. HOWEVER THERE WERE TWENTY TWO STUDENTS LEFT TO RIGHT IN THE EVACUATION BUS OUT OF TOWN TO SAFETY. ONE OF MY SECOND GREAT TEACHING PARTNERS. AND OUR NEWEST KINDERGARTEN TEACHER WELCOME TO TEACHING -- I RODE WITH THEM THROUGH FLAMES AND SMOKE. AT ONE POINT THE STUDENTS BECAME SLEEPY DUE TO THE SMOKE IN THE BOX. SERVICE TEACHERS TOOK TURNS CONSULTING STUDENTS AS THEY HELD WHAT PIECES OF THE BUS DRIVER SHIRT OVER THEIR MOUTHS. MORE THAN ONE OF OUR TEACHERS HAD TO RUN FROM THE FLAMES WHEN THEIR CARS WERE STUCK IN GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC. ONE EVEN STOOD WITH A GROUP OF PEOPLE CIRCLED BY FIRE ENGINES. AND HOSE DOWN WITH WATER AS BURNING EMBERS. RUNNING DOWN ON THEM. SEC. IT WAS A TRACK TRAUMATIC AS EXPERIENCE FOR US ALL. DESPITE THESE EXPERIENCES TEACHERS FAMILIES AND STUDENTS WANT TO COME BACK TO PARADISE AND AT SCHOOLS AND WE WANT TO BE THERE READY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A QUALITY EDUCATION THEY HAVE HAD AND DESERVE TO CONTINUE HAVING. OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS HOW TO KEEP. OUR AMAZING DEDICATED AND QUALIFIED STAFF THAT WE ARE KNOWN FOR WE CAN ONLY DO THIS IF TEACHERS KNOW THAT THEY WILL HAVE JOB TO COME BACK TO NEXT YEAR AND THE YEARS TO FOLLOW DURING THE REBUILDING PROCESS. MANY OF US FEAR THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS OF GUARANTEEING GUARANTEED FUNDING WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN STAFFING NEEDS. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POSSIBLE DOWNSIZING LEAVE US WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DISTRICT AND MAJOR DECISIONS THAT MAY BE -- PREMATURE. AND NOT MERE LONG TERM NEEDS WHAT WE NEED FROM THIS LEGISLATURE IS THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL SUPPORT THIS BILL WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE OVERWHELMING DEVASTATION. AND KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH OUR SPIRITS ARE HIGH AND HOPE IS ALIVE OUR HEARTS ARE STILL BROKEN AND MENDING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT JUST A QUICK ME TO MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL YODER SCHEIDER INTO YOUNG WE HAVE THE BI√£U COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IF EVER A COMMUNITY DESERVED A BILL LIKE THIS IT'S PARADISE.

I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR HEARING ME TODAY MY NAME IS BACK AND I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB. EIGHT IN HIGH SCHOOL I STRUGGLED WITH MY MENTAL HEALTH AS WELL AS ISSUES AT HOME I HAD FREQUENT PANIC ATTACKS MOST OF WHICH OCCUR DUE TO STRESS AT SCHOOL. SINCE ON MY CAMPUS WE DIDN'T HAVE A CONSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS ARE OFTEN AT A LOSS TO SEND AS TO WHERE TO SEND STUDENTS LIKE ME. IN FACT THERE ARE MANY YOUTH IN MY COUNTY WHO RECOGNIZE AND ALL HEALTH IS THERE WAS ONE OF THEIR MAIN CONCERNS WE SURVEYED OVER SEVEN HUNDRED YOUTH AND FOUND THAT MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEM HAD EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS THEMSELVES AND CONSIDER MENTAL HEALTH ONE OF THEIR TOP. PRIORITIES. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE PANIC ATTACKS I WAS OFTEN USHERED OUT OF CLASS OF THE PASS AND ANOTHER STUDENT IN HOPES THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK IT OFF SOMETIMES I WAS ALSO SENT TO THE OFFICE TO SPEAK TO COUNSELORS ONLY TO BE SENT RIGHT BACK? TO CLASS SO THE SYMPATHETIC REMARK ABOUT HOW I COULDN'T JUST SIT IN THE OFFICE. FOR ME THIS ONE ON MY MENTAL HEALTH WASN'T POSSIBLE I WAS USING VALUABLE TIME IN CLASSES THAT I WAS ALREADY FALLING BEHIND AND THE GREATER THE GAP IN MY EDUCATION BECAME THE MORE ANXIOUS I GOT UNTIL I WITHDRAW IT AND MY MENTAL HEALTH SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL. THIS EVENTUALLY LED TO ME DROPPING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND BECOMING HOMELESS. I'M NINETEEN YEARS OLD NOW AND THE NUMBER OF SALAMIS VOICES. I AM INVOLVED IN OUR LOCAL AMATEUR SAY PROCESS HAVE STABLE HOUSING AND I'M CURRENTLY STUDYING TURN MY GED AND WHAT IT TOOK TO PUT ME ON TRACK WAS FOR SOMEONE NAMED.

AND MEANINGFUL WORK. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEC IN SELF BUT IS TRULY A TWO WAY STREET AS PARENTS ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO OUR COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE UNLESS FORMALLY. TO OFFER KNOWLEDGE AND THAT LOCAL PERSPECTIVE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND TO NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. THE I. D. E. A. REQUIRES THAT FAMILIES BE INFORMED IN ORDER TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THE EDUCATIONAL PLANNING PROCESS. THE FEC ACTS AS A LIAISON AND A HELPFUL FACILITATOR WHEN QUESTIONS OR NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND BECOME IMPORTANT BARRIERS. THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF LEARNING ACCEPTING AND ACCEPTING UNDER ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF A CHILD WITH DISABILITIES OFTEN OVERWHELMING. IT CAN BE FILLED WITH FEELINGS OF GRIEF AND SOMETIMES LOSS OF POWER ON THE PART OF THE PARENT. THESE REALITIES OBVIOUSLY EXTEND ALL DAY AND IT IS THE FEC THAT PROVIDES A BRIDGE FROM SCHOOL TO HOME OFFERING TIME TO PAY PATHWAYS FOR COMMUNITY INCLUSION. AND RESOURCE SHARING. THE FISCAL AND GEOGRAPHIC SUPPORTS OF THIS BILL WILL ENHANCE AND EXTEND COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BALANCING AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATION PATH TO GUIDE SERVICES.

ONE NINETY EIGHT SHE'S TWO BILLS AB ONE NINETY A WITH -- SO FILE ITEM NUMBER SIX AB ONE NINETY EIGHT IS FILE ON NUMBER. SIX GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE IDEA WHICH IS THE CAREER APTITUDE TEST. AND A I KNOW THAT THERE'S A THIS HAS BEEN AN EXERCISE THAT SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IS. NOT WORTHY AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT THE REASON THAT I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I'M NOT READING MY NOTES AT AT ALL ALL IS -- ACTUALLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SEEN THAT -- E HAVE MANY STUDENTS SPENDING QUITE A LONG TIME AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES -- SOMETIMES FOUR FIVE EVEN SIX YEARS IN PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT DO GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES JUST AREN'T SURE WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF US HAVE TAKEN THESE TESTS I KNOW I DID WHAT MANY MANY YEARS AGO THEY'VE EVOLVED. AND SOME HAVE SAID WELL IF YOU TAKE THE TEST WHEN YOU'RE A FRESHMAN WHAT IS THAT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE SENIOR. OF I THINK OUR INTERESTS INVOLVED BUT THE KEY IS TO AT LEAST START TO GIVE STUDENTS INFORMATION OR SOME TYPE OF DIRECTION NOT SOME OF OUR PREMIUM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE LIKE THAT GRAHAM. STUDENTS NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT BEFORE THEY EVEN REGISTER AND WITHOUT ANY DIRECTION WE SEE NOW MORE AND MORE WITH THE ONLINE INFORMATION STUDENTS DON'T EVEN GET TO A CAMPUS. TO REGISTER TO EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT VARIOUS PATHWAYS ABOUT IF THEY'RE EVEN INTERESTED IN SOME TYPE OF SITE PROGRAM THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE AND SO WE HAVE STUDENTS KIND OF FLOUNDERING WHEN THEY GET TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR OTHER COLLEGES. SO WHY DO I THINK THIS IS SUCH A NEW IDEA IT REALLY ISN'T NEW. AND IT IS IT SOMETHING THAT COULD NOT BE IMPROVED BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STUDENTS EXPOSED -- TO IT'S TAKING A TEST I'M WILLING TO TAKE -- THE AMENDMENTS FOR THIS BILL BUT REALLY HOPE THAT ALONG THE WAY WE COULD CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT. BECAUSE HAVING SOMEBODY GO TO A WEBSITE UP THAT'S JUST NOT HAPPENING MOST OF US DON'T GO TO WEBSITE ESPECIALLY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO. THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT TO ME AS I'VE BEEN ASKED NUMEROUS TIMES BY COLLEGE COUNSELORS TO THEIR SEEN STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO DIRECTION. AND HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN EXPOSED TO ANY TYPE OF OF OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST PART TAKEN ONE OF THESE ASSESSMENTS THAT DOES NOT MEAN I WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON IT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT EVEN SPEND A LOT OF CLASS TIME ONE PERIOD -- WOULD COULD BE TAKEN TO TO HAVE THEM GO ONLINE AND CLASS EVEN IF THAT SET SO I KNOW THAT'S MORE THAN WHAT THE BILL SAYS. BUT BUT I WILL TAKE THE MEASUREMENTS AND A ON PRESENT. THIS BILL AS WHAT IS STATED BUT I'M HOPING WE COULD CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. ALL RIGHT THAT I I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WELL LAID OUT THAT'S FOR SURE -- ANY OTHER SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION I APOLOGIZE FOR OUR LATE POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT WE ARE HERE. TO OFFER OUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL COULDN'T AGREE MORE WITH THE AUTHOR WE DO A LOT IN OUR K. FOURTEEN EXPERIENCE TO EXPOSE STUDENTS ON HOW TO GET TO COLLEGE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A MANDATE FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM THIS COMMITTEE IN FACT FOR KIDS TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO COLLEGE AND CAREER SO THIS IS JUST ONE ADDITIONAL STEP TO HELP US GET TO THAT POINT. AND SO WE ARE TO HOPING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION GET THIS TOOL IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS. TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT WHO THEY WANT TO BE WHEN THEY GROW UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER SUPPORT SENIOR OTHER SUPPORTS ANY OPPOSITION -- I DON'T SEE ANY OPPOSITION -- ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR OF THE BILL -- YEAH I YOU KNOW I I WOULD SAY THE TEST -- HAVING AN INTEREST AND EVEN EXPOSURE ALL DIFFERENT CONCEPTS. AND I CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT SOMEONE TO TAKE A TEST IN SEVENTH GRADE TO BE TRACKED I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR GOAL EITHER. BUT I I WAS SHARING WITH -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL THAT MIND MY I TOOK ONE OF THOSE TESTS AND I CAME OUT AS CLERGY. RIGHT. IF YOU HEARD ME IF YOU HEARD ME READ THE PAPER THE OTHER DAY. MONDAY I DID PRETTY GOOD SO MAYBE WHAT ABOUT A GOOD YOU KNOW I WORRY ABOUT THESE TESTS I WORRY ABOUT THAT WE DON'T. USE THE WORD TEST WE COULD JUST SAY -- EXPOSURE OR EVALUATION AND AND THE REASON I IT REALLY KIND OF STICK IT ON THIS. IS. FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT ¬èKING ABOUT SEVENTH GRADERS I'M TALK REALLY LOOKING AT A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR SOMETIME IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR SO I KNOW THAT'S NOT SPECIFICALLY HERE AND WE'RE EVOLVING INTO THAT. BUT I REALLY THINK OF SO MANY STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT MANY OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE WE VISITED PARAMEDIC PARAMOUNT STUDIOS THIS LAST. WEEK AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE EVERYTHING FROM OF COURSE THE ACTORS BUT YOU HAVE THE CARPENTERS ON SITE YOU HAVE THE LIGHTING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT NOT ONLY TRADES BUT ALSO CAREERS AND SO OFTEN -- STUDENTS KIND OF FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO TAKE ONE PATHWAY AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SO MANY MORE MORE OPTIONS AND SO I'VE SAID THIS I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO DOCTOR WEBER ABOUT THIS. AND PART OF IT IS LET'S LET THEM HAVE A MENU AND LET THEM START TO UNDERSTAND LIKE WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE. AND SO EVEN IF IT SAYS YOU WANT TO BE A MORTUARY SCIENTIST. THERE IS A MORTUARY RIGHT AWAY. THAT WAS RIGHT. AT BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE WHERE YOU CAN BUILD. HE AT THE SITE. ALL RIGHT. I JUST ORIGINAL I VOTE OKAY -- ALL RIGHT BUT REALLY WHAT I REALLY THINK YOU WANT IS EXPOSURE. AND I I I DON'T THE CONTEST IS EXPOSURE BUT AYE AYE. THIS CONCEPT IS EVOLVING WE CAN INVOLVE AREA THERE. ALL RIGHT -- WITH THAT OTHER COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS YEAH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IF IT WAS UP TO THE ASSESSMENT I TOOK I WOULD CURRENTLY BE A PODIATRIST -- WHICH I GOT A PRICE YEAH NOT. BUT I AM I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS MEASURE AND I THINK THE EXPOSURE IS THE KEY PART OF IT AND I THINK IT'S YET ANOTHER PIECE WE KEEP CONTINUALLY HEARING ABOUT. GAPS PARTICULARLY IN THAT SECONDARY EDUCATION EXPERIENCE THAT SPEAK TO KIND OF ADULT TING. ONE OH ONE THE NEEDS FOR US TO EVENTUALLY GET TO A LIFE SKILLS COURSE THAT IT THAT INCLUDES CAREER EXPLORATION FINANCIAL LITERACY AND HOW TO FUNCTION AS AN ADULT ONCE YOU GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL SO I APPRECIATE THIS. AS A PIECE OF GETTING TO THAT MOVEMENT EVENTUALLY. THANK YOU WHEN I AND I THINK THIS CONVERSATION PORTS WELL WITH MY AND YOUR EFFORT AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM. EFFORTS -- TO INSURE THERE'S ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR C. T. YEAH AND I THINK NOW WE'RE HEADING INTO WHAT C. T. EVEN IS. IS IT'S IS IT KIND OF SEPARATE FROM STEM CELL THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE GOING TO HAVE THIS YEAR. FOR SURE SO -- AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ANY OTHER COMMENTS. THIRTY WEBER I WANT TO THANK US. I REMEMBER FOR BEING SO PERSISTENT WITH HER CONCERT -- AND I I THINK I I KNOW THERE'S VALUE IN -- IN. IN EXPOSING AND AND WHAT TO CREATE MEANS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS -- AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU WORK ON THIS BEFORE IT GETS TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I THINK WHEN YOU SEE APTITUDE TEST. THAT IMMEDIATELY TURNS PEOPLE OFF BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN SO MUCH WORK DONE ON HOW APTITUDE TEST V√† REALLY NOT VERY EFFECTIVE. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF AND I THINK IT WOULD PASS SOMETHING THIS IS. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO TAKE AN APTITUDE TEST THAT IS WHAT WILL TRANSLATE DOWN TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IF IT PASSES IN GETS FUNDED. THEY'LL BE AN APTITUDE TEST VERSUS TALKING ABOUT CAREER CHOICES CAREER OPTIONS LIFE SKI ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE EXPOSURE OF YOUNG PEOPLE TO CAREERS -- THAT MANY OF THEM ONLY GET YOU KNOW YOU GET YOUR TEACHER YOUR DOCTOR YOUR LAWYER OR MAYBE AN ENGINEER BUT EVEN BEYOND THAT WHAT ELSE IS INVOLVED IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION IS MORE THAN BEING IN. FRONT OF THE CLASSROOM THEY DON'T KNOW WITH SO I THINK GO. CAREER EXPLORATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- AND SO I HOPE BEFORE THIS GETS TO THE FLOOR THAT THE TURN APTITUDE TESTS IS SOMEONE OF THE DEFINED IN ANOTHER WAY BECAUSE IF IT PASSES AS AN APTITUDE TEST IT WILL BE AN APTITUDE TESTS. AND AND THAT WILL NOT GO WELL FOR STUDENTS. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS THE CORRECT WORD I WAS LOOKING FOR EXPLORATION. AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR TEAM TO TO AMANDA SO THAT IT WILL BE WHAT WERE DISCUSSING. ALL RIGHT -- WITH THAT AND NO FURTHER COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE -- THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS OCEAN THIS WITH A SECOND BY. DOCTOR WEBER I BELIEVE -- PLEASE CALL US. DID YOU CLOSE WAS AT A CLOSE YES. THINK YOU'RE UP. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. O'DONNELL THANK O'DONNELL AYE KILEY KALRA. KALRA I MCCARTY SMITH SMITH I WEBER. WEBER I THE BILL HAS FOR VOTE SO IT IS OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU WILL NOW MOVE TO I DON'T SEE MISTER BERMAN OTHERS. MR GERMAN ON MY PAPER -- ONE YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE I'M SORRY YOU HAVE A YES WE ARE AB THREE FIVE FOUR FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN PHONE. AND IT'S JUST AS PASSIONATE -- AND THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T SEE ME PRESENT TOO OFTEN AND AND THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE EVEN THOUGH I'VE SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN EDUCATION BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD FOR ME. TO A RACE WHAT I'VE SEEN IN EDUCATION WITHOUT GETTING OVERLY PASSIONATE AND THIS OF COURSE IS ABOUT LUNCHES AND WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SCHOOL LUNCHES AND TITLE ONE AND SO FORTH. BUT THIS BILL REALLY AIMS. TO AB -- THREE FIVE FOUR AND WE WILL TAKE A THE EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS BUT I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT STUDENTS THAT COME TO SCHOOL NOT ONLY HAVING GOOD NUTRITION BUT ALSO GETTING IT DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. MAKES FOR A STUDENTS SUCCESS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT DEPEND THE CHILDREN GO TO DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF LUNCH THEY GET SO THE EXAMPLE -- FOR MY PERSONAL TEACHING AS I'VE TAUGHT IN TITLE ONE SCHOOLS WHERE. THE STUDENTS RECEIVE BREAKFAST AND LUNCH AT OTHER SCHOOLS THAT MAY HAVE TITLE ONE STUDENTS. BUT NOT THE LARGE PERCENTAGE MANY TIMES THEY DON'T GET THE LUNCH OR EVEN THE BREAKFAST. I PERSONALLY HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP TO THE DISTRICT I WAS WORKING AT AND THEY SAID BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH STUDENTS THAN THEY WOULD NOT. PROVIDE -- THE LUNCH OR THE BREAKFAST OR SOMETIMES THEY'D GET AN ALTERNATIVE LUNCH -- A GRANOLA BAR AN APPLE OR SO FORTH SO THIS GOES BACK TO ST I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY REGARDING STUDENTS BEING ABLE TO HAVE NUTRITION OUT SCHOOL. AND SO THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE MAIL MANDATE BY REQUIRING A REPORT ON THE ALTERNATIVE MAIL PROGRAM SCHOOLS WILL PROVIDE WHEN OPTING OUT OF THE NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM. THIS WAY WE WILL ENSURE THAT ALL TO SERVE DINNERS DESERVING PUPILS HAVE ACCESS TO NUTRITION AND THERE BY A MORE EQUITABLE EDUCATION. WELL THE MOVE IN SECONDED. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SHARE GONZALEZ ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT AND WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER EFFORTS REGARDING FOOD SECURITY THANK YOU. IF YOU'RE BORN REPRESENTING AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA DIVISION WE KNOW THAT HALF OF THE DAILY COUNT CALORIES FOR CHILDREN. ARE FOUND IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN LUNCH AND BREAKFAST PROGRAMS. THIS MEASURE WILL ENSURE THAT ANY NUDE NEEDY CHILD HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEALS THAT THEY NEED TO IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY UNFORTUNATELY SOME CHILDREN DON'T HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THAT ONE MEAL AT SCHOOLS. AND SO ARE WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION. MISTER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAPITAL HOW ARE IN A BEHALF OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DEVELOPMENT CENTER. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BILL LAST YEAR AND EIGHTY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE PASSED REQUIRING THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS NEXT YEAR. I BEGAN TO FEED KIDS AT SCHOOL THEY'RE NOT ALREADY DOING THAT THIS PUTS NEW REGULATIONS IN PLACE BEFORE THAT BILL EVEN GOES INTO EFFECT. SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS HAVE OPTED OUT OF THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAM DUE TO THE CUMBERSOME REGULATIONS AND PAPERWORK -- AND THE MEAGER REIMBURSEMENT THIS THE CUMBERSOME REGULATIONS AND PAPERWORK ONLY YOU HAVE NO REIMBURSEMENT SO THE SCHOOLS -- AND PARTICULARS OF OUR LARGER CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE FEEDING ALL OF THEIR KIDS AT SCHOOL AND NOT SEEING THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AND NOW THEY WILL. NOT BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT FILLING OUT PAPERWORK AT THE STATE LEVEL WE THINK THAT ACTUALLY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF FEEDINGHUNGRY KIDS AND WE OPPOSE THE MEASURE. A SINGLE OTHER OPPOSITION WILL BRING UP BEHIND THE TO THE COMMITTEE. ALL THIS PRESENT A CONCERNED HE I DON'T KNOW THE WERE REALLY ADDRESSING THIS BILL BUT I KNOW A CHARTER SCHOOL IN LONG BEACH THAT. THEY KICK THEIR KIDS OUT AT LUNCH. RIGHT ON A PRETTY MAJOR STREET THEY HAVE TO GO TAKE OFF FOR AN HOUR. AND THEY DON'T FEED THEM BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO FIND A PLACE. TO STAY FOR AN HOUR AND THEN THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL IT'S JUST A CONCERN I HAVE. IS IN THE MOMENT OKAY GOOD -- BECAUSE I GUESS THAT'S A SAFETY CONCERN TO ME WITHIN OUR TALK ABOUT FOOD IS YOU KNOW PUSH KIDS OUT FOR AN HOUR I DON'T THINK IS.

IT'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED OKAY PLEASE -- YOU YOU DO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS YES AND AS FAR AS CUMBERSOME PAPERWORK FOR FILENE'S -- ALL OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ENGAGE IN THIS AND THERE'S TIMES THAT NEEDS TO BE SPENT ON IT BUT THE OUTCOME IS.

OUR SOCIETY IS WHEN IS PROFOUND CHANGES IN THE WAYS WE LIVE AND WORK DUE TO ADVANCES IN COMPUTING. THE INTEGRATION OF COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY INTO EVERY ASPECT OF DAILY LIFE NECESSITATES A FOUNDATION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR A WELL ROUNDED EDUCATION. TO ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH REQUIRED THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TO CONVENE A COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION ADVISORY PANEL TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION IS MEETING TODAY TO HEAR THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. GIVEN THE DEVELOPMENTS ON COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION AB TWENTY WILL CREATE THE CALIFORNIA COMPUTER SCIENCE COORDINATOR WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO OVERSEE THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN IN AND SHORT SUCCESS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT THE CALIFORNIA COMPUTER SCIENCE COORDINATOR WORK TO ADVANCE THE MISSION OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND PROVIDE STATE LEVEL LEADERSHIP.

COULD ORG IS A NATIONAL NON PROFIT DEDICATED TO EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS IN INCREASING PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES. WE BELIEVE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE COMPUTER SCIENCE OPENS MORE DOORS FOR STUDENTS AND ANY OTHER DISCIPLINE THE AVERAGE SALARY FOR COMPUTING OCCUPATION IN CALIFORNIA IS ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND AND THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OPEN COMPUTING JOBS. COMPUTING OCCUPATIONS ARE THE FASTEST GROWING AMONG THE HIGHEST PAYING IT AND YET ONLY TEACH COMPUTER SCIENCE. FROM WE DIVE DEEPER INTO THAT OFFERING THE SCHOOL COURSES BY URBAN VERSUS RURAL FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH AND UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES IT BECOMES CLEAR THERE IS A CASE OF HAVES AND HAVE NOTS. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION BE VOTING LATER TODAY ON THE ADOPTION OF THE COMPUTER SCIENCE OR TEACHER COMPLEMENTATION PLAN. STRATEGIES WITHIN THAT PLAN ARE FOCUSED ON CLOSING THESE GAPS IN EXPANDING ACCESS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE FOR ALL STUDENTS AND IN PARTICULAR TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS WE BELIEVE. WE NEED YOUR LEADERSHIP TO IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGIES BECAUSE EVERY STUDENT SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN COMPUTER SCIENCE REGARDLESS IF THEY ARE IN A RURAL DISTRICT OR IN HIGH POVERTY. ONE AB TWENTY CREATES A CS COORDINATOR TO MAN THANKS FOR TEACHER CLAM CO DOT ORG HAS IN THE NEED FOR SUCH A POSITION IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED A POLICY SIMILAR TO THOSE OUTLINED IN THE STRATEGIC PLANNING -- AND IN AB TWENTY INCLUDING THE ADOPTION OF THE RECENT.

SCIENCE OR TO TAKE IMPLEMENTATION ADVISORY PANEL CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A RAPIDLY GROWING TECHNOLOGY SECTOR BUT CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO EDUCATE STUDENTS TO FILL THE JOBS AVAILABLE IN THE SECTOR. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD ONLY FOUR THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINE COMPUTER SCIENCE GRADUATES AND ONLY 16% WERE WOMEN 6% WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND 10% WERE LATINO WE KNOW STUDENT EXPOSURE TO COMPUTER SCIENCE AT A YOUNG AGE IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSITY GAP IN COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD. AND PROVIDE THE WORK FORCE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. STATISTICS INDICATE THAT YOUNG WOMAN WHO TAKE DID AN ADVANCED PLACEMENT COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSE IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY A MAJOR IN COMPUTER SCIENCE IN COLLEGE.

ACCORDING TO THE EDUCATION COMMISSION OF THE STATES FULL DATE SCHOOL COULD KINDERGARTEN ATTENDANCE CAN HELP CLOSE ACHIEVEMENT GAP EARLY IN A CHILD'S EDUCATION. LONGER SCHOOL DAYS ENABLE CHILDREN TO RECEIVE MORE STRUCTURE IN FROM TEACHERS AS WELL AS MORE TIME INTERACTING WITH THEIR PEERS. THIS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED OF SCORES AND GREATER LONG LONG TERM ACHIEVEMENT THE POSITIVE AFFECT THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN ARE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED FOR MINORITY AND LOW IN THE COULD INCOME STUDENTS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ITS SOURCE REPORTED OF THAT ONLY 70% OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SERVING KINDERGARTEN AGE CHILDREN OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. A CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND MANY OF THE STATES THAT OFFER FULL PROGRAMS FOR LARGER PORTION THE POPULATION OF KINDERGARTNERS IF NOT ALL OF THEM. BECAUSE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN PARTICIPATE IN PRESCHOOL AND WE'RE WORKING HARDER ON ON PRESCHOOL CARE FOR EVERYONE AND T. K..
