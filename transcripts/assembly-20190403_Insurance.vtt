WE ARE GETTING READY TO GO HOME --

00:57:30.246 --> 00:57:31.815
AND IT TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE --

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:33.416
MY COLLEAGUE DAVID ARNOLD WHO

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:36.219
WORKS WITH ME AND I WERE ABOUT

00:57:36.286 --> 00:57:36.786
TWENTY FIVE FEET FROM STAGE

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:37.620
RIGHT.

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:38.922
WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD POPPING

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.990
NOISE -- WE THOUGHT IT WAS

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:43.426
FIRECRACKERS UNTIL -- SOME DAR

00:57:43.493 --> 00:57:45.161
LIQUID SPLATTERED ON DAVID

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:46.529
ARNOLD SPACE.

00:57:46.596 --> 00:57:48.231
AND EVERYONE STARTED RUNNING --

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:50.266
LITTLE DID WE KNOW WHEN DAY WHEN

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:51.434
TO GO WHITE THE LIQUID FROM HIS

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:52.869
FACE HE NOTICED IT WASN'T A

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.571
DRINK BUT IT WAS PROBABLY JUST

00:57:54.637 --> 00:57:58.107
SOME BLOOD -- YET AT THAT TIME

00:57:58.174 --> 00:58:00.043
WE KNEW NOTHING WAS WRONG BUT WE

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:02.545
WEREN'T CLEAR YET ON WHAT WAS

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:04.080
GOING ON THEN WE SAW SOMEONE

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:06.082
LYING ON THE FLOOR.

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.418
AHEAD OF US AND A GENTLEMAN WAS

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.386
HOLDING INDIVIDUALS NECK -- WE

00:58:10.453 --> 00:58:12.488
WENT OVER TO GO RENDER AID AND I

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:13.823
ASKED THE INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:15.024
HOLDING PRESSURE ON THE

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.659

00:58:16.726 --> 00:58:18.127
SAID HE HAD BEEN SHOT.

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:19.429
AND THAT'S WHEN WE KIND OF PUT

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:21.164
EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND NOTICED

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.333
THAT IT WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER --

00:58:23.399 --> 00:58:24.868
WE RAN OVER AND RENDERED AID I

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:28.104
STE I STARTED DOING CPR -- AND

00:58:28.171 --> 00:58:29.772
DAVE CHECKED -- FOR OTHER

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:33.243

AND DURING ALL THAT TIME.

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:37.480
A HAIL OF GUNFIRE RAIN DOWN UPON

00:58:37.547 --> 00:58:39.682
US FROM ABOVE -- EVERY TIME THAT

00:58:39.749 --> 00:58:41.584
HAPPENED WE WOULD STOP CPR AND

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.586
STOP GIVING AID AND WE WOULD --

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:44.888
COVER PATIENT TRY TO MAKE

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:47.423
OURSELVES AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:50.059
WHILE -- OTHER CONCERT GOERS

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:52.228
WERE KINDA TRAMPLING AROUND US

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:54.464
AND ON TOP OF US -- WE JUST KEPT

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.932
COVERING THAT INDIVIDUAL WAITING

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:57.767
FOR THE SHOOTING TO PASS -- AND

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.235
THEN WE CONTINUE -- TO TO

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:01.371
ADMINISTER CPR WHEN THE SHOOTING

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:03.439
STOPPED BRIEFLY -- WE SAW THAT

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:07.377
MOST EVERYONE HAD ESCAPED --

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:08.745
ESCAPE THE AREA.

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:10.914
THE STAGE LIGHTS WERE SHINING ON

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.383

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:16.085
LIGHTING ARE SCAPE ROUTE BUT

00:59:16.152 --> 00:59:18.955
THEY ALSO MADE US -- KIND OF

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:20.256
LIKE A PERFECT TARGET I GUESS

00:59:20.323 --> 00:59:22.492
YOU WOULD SAY.

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:24.761
THE NEXT ROUND A RAPID FIRE WAS

00:59:24.827 --> 00:59:26.696
AIMED IN OUR GENERAL DIRECTIONS --

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:27.830
BULLETS WERE HITTING THE GROUND

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.499
ALL AROUND AND WE KEPT

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:33.303
ADMINISTERING CPR -- MIND YOU

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:35.438
WHEN THE BULLETS WERE FLYING IN

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.640
OUR GENERAL AREA OR IN OUR

00:59:37.707 --> 00:59:39.609
DIRECTION THAT WE COULD FEEL --

00:59:39.676 --> 00:59:41.511
WE WOULD COVER THE PATIENT TRY

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:42.979
TO MAKE OR SELL THE SMALLEST

00:59:43.046 --> 00:59:43.579

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:45.315
CHANCE.

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:45.915
AND GIVE US A FIGHTING CHANCE

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:49.185

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.687
OR SIX OF ALL YOUR MAG CHANGE --

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:52.055

WE ARE ALL TALKING AMONGST

00:59:53.122 --> 00:59:54.223
OURSELVES AND WE'RE GETTING

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.124
READY TO MOVE THE PATIENT

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.293
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:57.994
OBVIOUSLY AN ACTIVE SHOOTER

00:59:58.061 --> 00:59:58.728

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:05.768
INDIVIDUAL IS THE BEST CHANCE WE

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.503
AND WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.639
THAT MOVING THE PATIENT THAT'S

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.342
WHEN -- I SAID OKAY LET'S FINISH

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:13.910
MY LAST ROUND CPR AND THAT'S

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.345
WHEN I WAS STRUCK IN THE RIGHT

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.046
ARM THE RIGHT FORM -- THERE WAS

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:18.348
NOTHING MORE WE COULD DO FOR THE

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:20.616
VICTIM BUT WE KNEW IF WE STAYED

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.485
THERE WE'RE GOING TO DIE -- WE

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:25.688
RAN FOR OUR LIVES -- THE BULLETS

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:26.656
WERE.

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.124
WE COULD HEAR AND FEEL THEY WERE

01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:29.492
GETTING CLOSER.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:30.827
IT FELT IT FELT AS THOUGH THE

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:34.030
GUNMEN HAD -- KIND OF SINGLE

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.598

TRY TO GET OUT OF THE ARENA AND

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.037
THE AREA -- THE REST OF WHAT

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:42.438
HAPPENED IS A BIT HAZY BUT I

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.340
REMEMBER WE GOT INTO A CAR AND

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.641
THEY DROVE ME TO THE CLOSEST

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.011

APPLIED A TOURNIQUET BUT STILL

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.822
FROM HOW FAR WE RAN FROM WHEN WE

QUICKLY WHY WHAT ARE THE WHAT

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.142
ARE THE CONCERNS WE HAVE ON A

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.244
POLICY BASIS ABOUT HOW THIS IS

01:05:15.311 --> 01:05:17.246
DONE SUPPOSED WHETHER IT'S DONE

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:17.747
FIRST.

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:18.547
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:19.649
INVESTIGATIVE DIFFICULTIES HOW

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:21.284
DO WE DETERMINE WHAT ACTIVITIES

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.818
ARE ACTUALLY BEING ENGAGED AND

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.687
AT THE TIME -- THESE INCIDENTS

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.222
CAN BE VERY HAZY SO WE'RE A

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.290
LITTLE BIT WORRIED ABOUT

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.492
COMPILING A FACT PATTERN THAT

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:30.226
WHEN WE DO INVESTIGATIONS ON

01:05:30.293 --> 01:05:32.428
CLAIMS. TO AS YOU MENTIONED WERE

WORRIED ABOUT POTENTIAL CIVIL

01:05:36.132 --> 01:05:37.466
LIABILITY.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.567
AT THIRD IS SCOPE AND I THINK

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:39.368
THIS IS REALLY THE BIGGEST ONE

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:40.269
IF LIKE IF I COULD FOCUS THERE

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:40.603
FOR A SECOND.

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:42.104
I THINK WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:43.839
IS A VERY CLEAR DESCRIPTION --

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.141
OF A CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH WE

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.509
WOULD WANT TO PROVIDE THIS

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.777
COVERAGE OUTSIDE THE STATE WE

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:48.811
ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.680
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL -- AND

01:05:50.746 --> 01:05:52.048
THINK OF ALL THE OTHER WAYS IN

01:05:52.114 --> 01:05:53.783
WHICH IT COULD BE APPLIED -- SO

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:55.117
NO WE NEED TO SEPARATE OURSELVES

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.852
FROM THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION

01:05:56.919 --> 01:05:58.187
AND LOOK AT KIND OF THE DAILY

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.189
TYPES OF CLAIMS THAT WE RECEIVE --

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.724
AS PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND SO WE DO

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:02.958
HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY THAT

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:04.093
THE BILL AS DRAFTED BECAUSE IT

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.128
IT ITS SCOPE IS FAR BEYOND THE

BILL FOR IT AND AS I JUST

01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.175
THINKING ABOUT IT. ONE OF THE

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:01.710
ONE OF THE PLEASURES AS IT WERE

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:03.378
OF BEING A LAWYER.

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:04.747
IS IT FROM TIME TO TIME YOUR

01:13:04.813 --> 01:13:06.381
LINES IN THE LAW.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.516
THAT ARE BIGGER THAN THE CASE IN

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.218
WHICH THEY ARE UTTERED.

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:10.419
AND ABOUT A CENTURY AGO THERE

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.754

AN UP LIFTED KNIFE.

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.369
AND I THINK THAT CAPTURES THIS

01:13:27.436 --> 01:13:29.238
MOMENT THAT THERE'S TIMES WHEN

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:30.706

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:33.575

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:37.658
THE PROPONENTS OF NINE NINE

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:38.225
EIGHT ONE OF ARGUE THAT THE

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:39.860
ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS OF THE

01:36:39.927 --> 01:36:41.028
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ARE

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:42.763
SUFFICIENT FOR CONSUMERS.

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.398
OR THAT THE TCPA PREAMPS AND

01:36:44.465 --> 01:36:45.699
PREVENTS THE INSURANCE

01:36:45.766 --> 01:36:46.367
COMMISSIONER FROM IS ENFORCEMENT

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:47.334
AUTHORITY.

01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:48.669
THE FACT IS THAT INSURANCE

01:36:48.736 --> 01:36:49.703
COMMISSIONER CAN STILL DO

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:51.839
EVERYTHING HE ALREADY CAN'T DO.

01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:57.711
NOTHING CHANGES ON THE

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:58.646
REGULATORY SIDE OF THE EQUATION.

01:36:58.712 --> 01:36:59.213
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THAT

01:36:59.280 --> 01:36:59.813
CONSUMERS CAN TAKE ACTION TO

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.447
PROTECT THEIR OWN INFORMATION.

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:01.015
ALL COMPANIES HAVE TO TAKE

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:01.815
REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT

01:37:01.882 --> 01:37:03.250
THEIR DATA.

01:37:03.317 --> 01:37:04.618
AND IF THEIR INFORMATION IS

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:06.287
DISCLOSED WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:08.622
AND THEY DID NOT TAKE REASONABLE

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.724
STEPS THE KEY WORDS TO PROTECT

01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:11.625
THAT.

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.327
THEN THE CONSUMER HAS A PRIVATE

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:13.861
RIGHT OF ACTION TO RECOVER

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.396
DAMAGES.

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:17.665
IN CLOSING NINE EIGHT ONE MERELY

01:37:17.731 --> 01:37:19.733
SHIELDS THE ENTIRE INSURANCE AND

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.402
FINANCIAL INDUSTRIES FROM ANY

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.837
REAL OR ENFORCEABLE DUTIES.

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:26.073
RESPONSIBILITIES OR INCENTIVES

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.242
TO PROTECT THE PERSONAL PRIVATE

01:37:28.309 --> 01:37:30.177
INFORMATION OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:33.214
SO ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PRIVATE.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.448

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:35.516
VULNERABLE IN OUR FINANCIAL

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.585

SINCE PASSED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY

WHICH I THINK INDICATES THE

01:39:26.126 --> 01:39:29.196
SUBTLE NATURE OF THIS LAW.

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:30.497

REGULATORY MECHANISM. TO ENABLE

REASONS FOR ANY ADVERSE

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.078
UNDERWRITING DECISION.

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:18.979
WHY DO I FEEL WE HAVE A VERY

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.948
COMPLICATED FIELD OF ENTERPRISE?

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.449
THE SUBJECT TO AN INFORMATION

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:24.551
LAW THE GREW OUT OF A NATIONAL

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.153
REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.855
BEEN THERE FOR FORTY YEARS I

01:40:27.921 --> 01:40:29.556
WOULD NOT DISAGREE THAT THERE

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:30.724
MAY BE SOME WAY IN WHICH YOU

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:31.992
MIGHT IN TIME MAKE SOME

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:32.926
ADJUSTMENT.

01:40:32.993 --> 01:40:34.428
BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE

01:40:34.495 --> 01:40:35.796
LAST TIME THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:36.697
ADOPTED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:38.532
ACTUAL DISTRICT INSURANCE

01:40:38.599 --> 01:40:42.870
BUSINESS -- IT WAS IN.

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:43.437
NINETEEN NINETY NINE AND WAS

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:45.539
PROPER REPUDIATED BY THE VOTERS

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.007
OF CALIFORNIA BY MORE THAN.

01:40:47.074 --> 01:40:48.108
TWO TO ONE I THINK INSTINCTIVELY

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:50.411
UNDERSTAND THAT. TO SET A

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:52.179
INSURANCE LITIGATION TARGET ON

01:40:52.246 --> 01:40:53.380
INSURANCE BUSINESS.

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:55.282
CAN LEAD TO A GREAT DEAL

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.083
EXPENSIVE WILL TRANSLATE INTO

01:40:56.150 --> 01:40:57.017
RATE.

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:59.119
AND COST INCREASES SO I THINK

01:40:59.186 --> 01:41:02.322
IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY REASONABLE

01:41:02.389 --> 01:41:03.257
NOTION.

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:05.459
THAT A LAW THAT COMES OUT OF THE

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:07.594
NATIONAL ANY I SEE REGULATORY

01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:08.729
SYSTEM.

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.330
REPRESENTS A BALLOT IN MULTIPLE

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:11.665
INTEREST.

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.000
AND IS WELL SETTLE IN FORTY

01:41:13.066 --> 01:41:14.668
YEARS BOTH WITH THAT SYSTEM BUT

01:41:14.735 --> 01:41:16.403
UNDER SARBANES OXLEY HIS FEDERAL

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:18.071
DUTIES ON CORPORATIONS.

01:41:18.138 --> 01:41:20.340
DODD FRANK IT'S FEDERAL DUES ON

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:21.442
CORPORATIONS.

01:41:21.508 --> 01:41:23.076
IS WORTH MAINTAINING.

01:41:23.143 --> 01:41:26.814
AND I FINALLY WANT TO NOTE THAT.

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.848
IN AS MUCH OF PROP ONE OH THREE

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:28.982
WHICH CONSUMER WATCHDOG WAS

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:30.451
INSTRUMENTAL IN THE ADOPTION OF

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:32.753
SPECIFIED SIXTEEN RATING FACTOR

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:34.221
FOR AUTO INSURANCE.TO START

01:41:34.288 --> 01:41:36.757
HAVING A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.192
TAKE DATA OUT OF THE SYSTEM

01:41:38.258 --> 01:41:39.827
WITHOUT EXPAND HOW YOU RECORD

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:42.029
RECONCILE THOSE PIECES.

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.497
IS ITSELF ALSO.

01:41:43.564 --> 01:41:46.400
RECKLESS WE ARE UNDER PROP ONE

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.067
OH THREE THERE ARE THESE

01:41:47.134 --> 01:41:48.836
SPECIFIED RATING FACTORS YOU

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.204
CANNOT HAVE OF THE RATING

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.771
FACTORS YOU CAN ONLY MAKE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:51.772
DECISIONS.

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:53.474
BASED ON THOSE THINGS AND SO

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:54.975
THERE'S NO EXPLANATION OF HOW TO

01:41:55.042 --> 01:41:56.477
IN A WAY WITH DATA.

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:57.811
RECONCILES WITH THAT INSURE

01:41:57.878 --> 01:41:59.746
OBLIGATION UNDER VOTER PASSED

01:41:59.813 --> 01:42:01.181
LAW FROM.

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.182
NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO I THINK

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.283
IT'S A VERY GOOD BILL I THINK

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:04.751
THE CHAIR FOR BRING IT FORWARD.

ISSUE -- YOU KNOW.

01:42:23.737 --> 01:42:25.205
OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE DID THE CCPA

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.406
WAS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.641
WHEN WE COULDN'T TAKE A LOT OF

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:28.942
CERTAIN THINGS INTO

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:29.877
CONSIDERATION WAS.

01:42:29.943 --> 01:42:31.979
WAS MORE OF A AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:33.380
US TO HUSTLE TO AVOID WHAT WAS

01:42:33.447 --> 01:42:35.048
CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A DISASTER

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:37.050
ON THE BALLOT -- GIVEN WHAT THE

01:42:37.117 --> 01:42:39.286
LAW -- THAT WAS PROPOSED IN HOW

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:40.087
WAS GOING TO BE PASSED AND HOW

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.154
WOULD HAVE APPLIED CALIFORNIA

01:42:41.221 --> 01:42:42.356
BUSINESSES AND WHAT THAT WOULD

01:44:33.133 --> 01:44:35.268
TO MISS COM LONGER OF IN THE

01:44:35.335 --> 01:44:38.405
BIGGER PICTURE -- AS MR COOLEY

EXPLAINED -- THE INSURANCE

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.308
COMMISSIONER WHO WAS ELECTED AS

01:44:41.375 --> 01:44:42.209
HAD.

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:43.710
A SUBSTANTIAL REGULATORY

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:46.580
AUTHORITY SINCE.

NINETEEN EIGHTY NOW THE ATTORNEY

GENERAL OF OUR STATE IS ALSO

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:52.352
ELECTED WILL HAVE REGULATORY

01:44:52.419 --> 01:44:55.222
AUTHORITY ON THE ENTIRE MASS OF

THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PART.

01:44:57.357 --> 01:44:58.925
OF PRIVACY ACT.

01:44:58.992 --> 01:45:00.594
AND ONE GOAL OF THESE

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.695
CONVERSATIONS THERE ARE MANY

01:45:01.762 --> 01:45:02.863
GOALS.

01:45:02.929 --> 01:45:05.699
OF THE MODERNIZATION OF THE OF A

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.067
TRADITIONAL INSURANCE

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:08.368
COMMISSIONER'S.

01:45:08.435 --> 01:45:10.337
AUTHORITY TO MODERNIZE IT

01:45:10.404 --> 01:45:12.973
UPDATED AS MISTER CALDERON SAID.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.941
IS A GOAL SECONDLY TO AVOID

01:45:15.008 --> 01:45:18.478
REDUNDANCY AND ANY EFFICIENCY --

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.980
BETWEEN THOSE TWO DEPARTMENTS

01:45:20.047 --> 01:45:21.381
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.950
WHICH HAS -- AND ENFORCEMENT

01:45:24.017 --> 01:45:25.852
STAFF AND HAS  HISTORY

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.688
ALMOST FORTY YEARS ON THESE

01:45:27.754 --> 01:45:29.122
TOPICS.

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.956
AND THEN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:32.859
WHO NOW HAS NEW AUTHORITY ON THE

01:45:32.926 --> 01:45:34.494
SUBJECT AND SO BALANCING THAT

01:45:34.561 --> 01:45:35.862
OUT I THINK IT'S A VERY

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:37.064
LEGITIMATE.

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.533
ROLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TO

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:40.901
BALANCE THAT OUT TO AVOID

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:43.704
REDUNDANCY AND INEFFICIENCIES

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:46.573
AND CONFUSION -- THERE IS A

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.974
SCENARIO THEY'LL BE TWO SETS OF

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.743
REGULATIONS WHICH DON'T AGREE

01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:51.845
AND THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:53.313
BAD FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:54.948
SO THESE CONVERSATIONS WILL

01:45:55.015 --> 01:45:56.416
CONTINUE OUR STAFF HAS BEEN

01:45:56.483 --> 01:45:58.018
DOING A GOOD JOB BRINGING PEOPLE

01:45:58.085 --> 01:46:01.521
TOGETHER -- AND YOU KNOW MANY

01:46:01.588 --> 01:46:03.323
BILLS WE INTRODUCE OUR FOR

01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:05.992
PURPOSES OF ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS

01:46:06.059 --> 01:46:08.061
AND DISCUSSION TO TRY TO REACH.

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:10.130
THE BEST POSSIBLE GOALS TRY TO

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:12.699
REACH CONSENSUS -- AS MISTER

01:46:12.766 --> 01:46:15.635
CALDERON SAID THE CCPA WAS

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:16.803
APPROVED PRETTY.

01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:19.639
THE PARTY HASTILY LAST YEAR --

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:25.946
AND MANY INDUSTRIES NOW ARE ARE

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.881
IN SOME SOME CHAOS BECAUSE THEY

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:29.316
HAVE TO NOW.

01:46:29.382 --> 01:46:30.383
THE FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMPLY

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:32.519
WITH THE LAW.

01:46:32.586 --> 01:46:36.123
AND PRE EXISTING LAW -- AS WELL --

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:37.357
I HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:39.459
MR MCTAGGART WHO IS THE AUTHOR

01:46:39.526 --> 01:46:41.194
OF THE INITIATIVE.

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:43.396
THAT ENDED UP BECOMING LAW LAST

01:46:43.463 --> 01:46:45.499
AUGUST AND I HAVE A LOT OF

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:47.934
RESPECT FOR HIS EFFORTS AND WE

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:49.603
HAD A VERY FRANK CONVERSATION

01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:51.071
ABOUT THIS SUBJECT.

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:52.606
AS MISTER CALDERON SAID I THINK

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:54.841
THE REAL FOCUS OF THE INITIATIVE

01:46:54.908 --> 01:46:56.576
WAS ON THE TECH INDUSTRY AND

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.979
OTHER INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:59.045 --> 01:47:00.514
NOT NECESSARILY INSURANCE

01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.882
HOWEVER INSURANCE IS A BIG

01:47:01.948 --> 01:47:04.284
INDUSTRY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:06.486
THE NEW REGULATIONS WORK -- FOR

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:08.155
CONSUMERS AND WORK FOR THE

01:47:08.221 --> 01:47:10.190
MARKET PLACE AS WELL --

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:13.193
OCCASIONALLY THIS THIS BUILDING

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:16.129
WILL WILL PASS A LAW THAT.

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.964
TO THE CAUSES RATES TO GO UP --

01:47:18.031 --> 01:47:18.799
AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOOD

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.534
EITHER SO WE WANT A DYNAMIC

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:23.937
MARKET PLACE WE WANT FAIRNESS.

01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:24.437
WE WANT CONSUMERS TO BE

01:47:24.504 --> 01:47:25.906
EMPOWERED.

01:47:25.972 --> 01:47:26.573
AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THESE IN

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.208
THE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS I

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:30.744
