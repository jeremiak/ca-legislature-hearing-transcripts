THAT.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:27.986

IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY IN

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:58.650
JAILS AND PRISONS AND IN FACT

00:31:58.716 --> 00:32:00.585

00:32:34.185 --> 00:32:35.687
TO THE FACT THAT COMPANIES DON'T

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.021
WORK THE SAME WAY THAT THEY HAVE.

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:38.089
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:39.457

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:43.394

ONE THIS BILL HOWEVER STILL

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:00.211

I ANTICIPATE THE OPPOSITION TO

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:44.468
THIS BILL WILL SUGGEST THAT

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.070

FOR FOOD DURING HER PREGNANCY.

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:20.004
THIS COST LEADS PEOPLE TO MAKE

00:37:20.071 --> 00:37:21.405
THE DIFFICULT CHOICE BETWEEN

00:37:21.472 --> 00:37:22.840

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.041

PRESS RELEASE STATED IT WAS

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.490
DETERMINED THAT COPAYS HAVE

00:37:39.557 --> 00:37:41.158
MINIMAL FISCAL BENEFITS AND ARE

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:42.893
NOT ALIGNED WITH PATIENT CARE.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.428

SMALL AMOUNT IT CAN BE A LOT FOR

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:54.639
SOMEONE WHO'S INCARCERATED WHILE

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.340

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.205
AND FINALLY THE STATUTE ALREADY

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:17.007
PROVIDE AT THE DIRECTION OF

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:18.576
MEDICAL STAFF SHALL BE WITHOUT

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:19.710
CHARGE.

00:41:19.777 --> 00:41:20.811
SO AGAIN THIS IS NOT ABOUT

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:22.112
TRYING TO COLLECT THREE DOLLARS

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:24.048
FROM AN INMATE JUST TO RAISE

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.617
MONEY THE THE CHALLENGE HERE IS

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:26.817
THAT.

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.953
THERE ARE INMATES. FOR BETTER OR

00:41:29.019 --> 00:41:32.122
WORSE WHO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.024
WHO SEEK TO GET OUT OF THERE SO --

00:41:34.091 --> 00:41:35.626
BECAUSE NOT BECAUSE THEY HAD A

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:37.194
MEDICAL ISSUE NECESSARILY BUT

00:41:37.261 --> 00:41:38.896
BECAUSE THEY THEY WANT TO LEAVE

00:41:38.963 --> 00:41:39.997
THEIR CELL.

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:41.465
AND SO BECAUSE WE THINK THIS IS

00:41:41.532 --> 00:41:43.434
A USEFUL TOOL IN PREVENTING OR

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.835
AT LEAST TRYING TO DISCOURAGE

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.570
THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR.

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.038
THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:49.673
STOPPING SOMEONE FROM GETTING

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.474
MEDICAL CARE IF THEY TRULY

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.242
NEEDED.

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.610
EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.645
FUNDS IN THERE AND MADE ACCOUNT --

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.447
FOR THOSE REASONS WE

00:41:56.513 --> 00:41:57.047
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THE BILL

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:57.348

DEFINITELY IMPACT THE OPERATIONS

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:30.114
OF THE COUNTY JAILS.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.849
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE

00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:33.317

OPPOSITION.

COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM YES

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.894
MISTER.

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:46.931
SO MR CELLS ELLA --

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:50.634
MY CONCERN IS SOMEONE COULD HAVE

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.469
THREE DOLLARS IN AN ACCOUNT.

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:53.904
BUT IT'S THEIR ONLY THREE

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.106
DOLLARS AND THEY MIGHT NEEDED TO

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.741
MAKE A PHONE CALL HOME THAT

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.443
MIGHT NEEDED --

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.412
FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND SO EVEN

00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:02.846
THOUGH THEY MIGHT HAVE THE THREE

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:05.416
DOLLARS GIVEN THAT THEY CAN'T

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.818
EARN MONEY WHILE THEY'RE IN JAIL.

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:09.386
AND MANY OF THEM ARE ISOLATED --

00:43:09.453 --> 00:43:10.955
FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS WHO

00:43:11.021 --> 00:43:13.757
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE THE MONEY --

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:14.725
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:17.328
ALLOW THEIR THAT THAT'S MY MAIN

00:43:17.394 --> 00:43:19.096
CONCERN WITH THIS NOT THAT.

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:21.865
I AM SURE THAT THE SHERIFF IS I

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.434
KNOW HIM IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.802
ASSEMBLY DIDN'T HAVE THREE

00:43:24.868 --> 00:43:27.004
DOLLARS HE LET HIM GO --

00:43:27.071 --> 00:43:28.505
BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THEY HAVE

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:31.141
SO LITTLE MONEY THAT THREE

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:32.443
DOLLARS IS VERY PRECIOUS

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:32.743
[inaudible]

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.878
THANK YOU.

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:37.581
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SO.

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:40.818
THAT'S MY CONCERN YOU HAVE A

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:43.387
RESPONSE OH SURE I DON'T.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.222
KNOW IF THE QUESTION.

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.824
IS WHETHER THE CHAIR OF THE I

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:47.491
TOTALLY UNDERSTAND MISTER QUIRK

00:43:47.558 --> 00:43:48.726
AND I I THINK IN THE SITUATION

00:43:48.792 --> 00:43:49.393
WHICH YOU DESCRIBED IN WHICH AN

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:49.860
INMATE DOESN'T HAVE.

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.328
SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT

00:43:51.395 --> 00:43:53.297
THE STATUTE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:53.864
SHERIFF DECISION THE STATUTE

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.065
PROVIDES.

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:57.434
THAT THE PERSON SHALL NOT BE

00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.870
CHARGED IF THEY DON'T HAVE

00:43:59.937 --> 00:44:01.472
REALLY RECOGNIZES.

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:03.507
THAT CONCERN IN THAT WAY AND WE

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:04.708
THINK DISTRICTS THE APPROPRIATE

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.010
BALANCE BETWEEN SAYING LOOK IF A

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:07.578
PERSON IS MEDICAL CARE AND THEY

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.645
DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS.

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:09.780
THEN THAT'S THE SITUATION BUT

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:10.714
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO GET

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:11.682
FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNT IF THERE

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:12.816
ARE FAMILY UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:44:12.883 --> 00:44:13.984
EXAMPLE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:15.285
MAY BE ISOLATED.

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:16.520
BUT IF THEY HAVE SOME FUNDS IN

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:17.287
THE ACCOUNT AND THAT'S

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:18.422
DETERMINATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.456
MADE AGAIN.

00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.258
THE PROVIDER IS PERMITTED TO

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.092
WAIVE THE FEE AND IF THERE'S

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.027
ANYTHING THAT'S AN ACTUAL

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.695
EMERGENCY THEY'RE REQUIRED TO

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:25.829
WAIVE THE FEE.

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:28.399
BUT THE POINT HERE IS --

00:44:28.465 --> 00:44:29.967
YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE.

00:44:30.034 --> 00:44:32.269
A BAD COLD BIKE I HAVE HAD FOR

00:44:32.336 --> 00:44:33.470
THE LAST MONTH THAT COULD BE

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:36.106
GOING INTO BRONCHITIS.

00:44:36.173 --> 00:44:38.075
IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY BUT YOU

00:44:38.142 --> 00:44:39.510
ONLY HAVE THREE DOLLARS IN YOUR

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.078
ACCOUNT AND YOU REALLY WANT TO

00:44:41.145 --> 00:44:42.913
MAKE THAT CALL OUR AND YOU NEED

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.149
THAT THREE DOLLARS TO MAKE THAT

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:46.517
CALL --

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:47.618
SOMEONE.

00:44:47.684 --> 00:44:50.020
WOULD BE TEMPTED PERHAPS NOT TO

00:44:50.087 --> 00:44:51.522
GO AND THEN THEY HAVE PNEUMONIA --

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:54.091
BEFORE SO MY QUESTION AGAIN IF

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:54.625
THEY DON'T HAVE THE THREE

00:44:54.691 --> 00:44:56.360
DOLLARS IT'S CLEAR BUT IF THEY

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:58.295
ONLY HAVE THREE DOLLARS MY

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.463
CONCERN IS.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:01.298
THAT THEY WOULD BE TEMPTED NOT

00:45:01.365 --> 00:45:06.437
TO GO WORSE IN MY YOU KNOW.

00:45:06.503 --> 00:45:07.504
DO YOU HAVE A SOLUTION FOR THIS

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.540
PROBLEM.

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:10.407
BY.

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:11.475
THE THE CASE IN WHICH YOU

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:13.277
DESCRIBE COULD BE FAIRLY

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.678
SPECIFIC AND AS MUCH AS AN

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:16.547
INMATE MAY ONLY HAVE EXACTLY THE

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:18.749
PRICE OF THE MEDICAL COPAY.

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:20.350
THIS ASSUMING THAT THE SHERIFF

00:45:20.417 --> 00:45:22.553
IS ACTUALLY CHARGING AT AND IF

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.221
THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:25.355
FEES CHARGED.

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:27.391
AND THE PERSON ONLY HAS EXACTLY

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:28.459
THREE DOLLARS AND THEY HAVE TO

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:29.660
MAKE THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S A

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.128
CHOICE THAT HAS TO BE MADE AND

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:31.995
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL CHOOSE THE

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:34.031
MEDICAL CARE BUT WE UNDERSTAND.

00:45:34.098 --> 00:45:36.500
THE CONCERN BUT THAT'S AGAIN WE

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.702
WE WE SEE THE THE THE THE BIGGER

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:40.337
CONCERN FOR US IS THAT WHEN

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:42.739
SOMEONE WHO IS NOT IN NEED OF

00:45:42.806 --> 00:45:44.007
MEDICAL CARE --

00:45:44.074 --> 00:45:45.642
THAT AGAIN THIS CAN BE A

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:47.778
DETERRENT TO SEEKING WHAT WE

00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.446
WOULD DESCRIBE AS A FRIVOLOUS

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:52.216
REQUEST.

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:56.653
MOVE THE BILL [inaudible]

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.288
YES.

00:45:58.355 --> 00:45:59.156
ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE DID I

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.324
UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.892
CDC OURS ALREADY REMOVED THIS

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:04.261
PRACTICE YES THEY HAVE AND IN

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.863
FACT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THE

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.630
WE DON'T HAVE COMPLETE

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.432
INFORMATION WE WE'VE BEEN TRYING

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:09.867
TO REACH OUT TO ALL THE COUNTIES.

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:12.002
AND HEARD BACK FROM ONLY SOME

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:13.470
BUT COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE AS

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.372
LARGE AS SANTA CLARA.

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.474
DON'T CHARGE THESE HE'S ALREADY

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:18.675
BECAUSE THE COST OF THE

00:46:18.742 --> 00:46:20.611
ADMINISTRATION IS MORE THAN WHAT

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:21.678
THEY RECEIVE.

00:46:21.745 --> 00:46:23.680
THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT FOUND A

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.048
CHALLENGE WITH FRIVOLOUS.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.384
SUITS AND THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN

00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:28.085
DONE NATIONALLY --

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:31.321
BOTH STATE JAILS AND LOCAL JAILS

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.456
AND STATE PRISONS.

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:34.525
HAS SHOWN THAT THESE KINDS OF

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.059
FEES THE COPAYS ARE MORE OF AN

00:46:36.126 --> 00:46:37.327
IMPEDIMENT TO GETTING.

00:46:37.394 --> 00:46:40.631
ACCESS SO THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS.

00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:41.865
MINIMAL AMOUNTS IN THEIR CAMP

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.634
MAY NOT SEEK SERVICE BECAUSE

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.135
THEY THEY WANT TO HOLD ON TO

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:47.371
THAT MONEY AND YES THE SHERIFF'S

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.805
OFFICE MAY HAVE THE RIGHT OR THE

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:50.073
ABILITY TO WAY THAT.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.443
BUT IF THEY DON'T THEN THAT IN

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.379
SAID THAT IN MAY TENDS NOT TO

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:55.979
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MEDICAL

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:56.847
SERVICES.

00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:59.183
THEREBY FORCING A AN EMERGENCY

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:01.051
SITUATION WHERE THERE HAD BEEN

00:47:01.118 --> 00:47:02.019
ONE IN THE PAST.

00:47:02.085 --> 00:47:03.587
THIS IS A POPULATION THAT HAS

00:47:03.654 --> 00:47:05.656
VERY LOW HEALTH EDUCATION THEY

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:06.957
DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND HOW THE

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.659
SYSTEMS WORK SO THEY'RE NOT

00:47:08.725 --> 00:47:10.360
INCLINED TO WANT TO TAKE

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:11.828
ADVANTAGE OF IT WHICH IS WHY

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:13.497
THIS BILL IS BEING SUPPORTED.

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:15.032
BY A NUMBER THE MEDICAL HEALTH

00:47:15.098 --> 00:47:17.100
PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY SEE ON A

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.002
DAY TO DAY BASIS IN JAILS AND

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:20.003
PRISONS.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:22.039
THAT DID AREA THAT THIS

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:27.044
REPRESENTS.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.412
YES MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE MISTER

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:29.546

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.057
RESTRAINED SOMEONE'S BEHAVIOR

00:54:21.124 --> 00:54:23.593

INSTRUMENTAL IN THE PASSAGE OF

00:55:32.262 --> 00:55:35.065
THE ORIGINAL LAW AND TWENTY

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:36.066
FOURTEEN AYE AND WE WORKED VERY

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:37.267
HARD ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.613
BEEN --

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.982
DISAPPOINTING AND SLOW I BELIEVE

00:55:53.049 --> 00:55:54.617
STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS LAW

00:55:54.684 --> 00:55:56.653
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SAVE MANY

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.755
LIVES IN THE FACT THAT IT HAS

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:01.791
BEEN SO UNDER USED IN CALIFORNIA.

OTHER STATES HAVE NOW ENACTED

00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:07.897
SIMILAR LAWS IN APPEARS THAT

00:56:07.964 --> 00:56:09.399
MOST STATES ARE USING IT.

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:10.500

IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME.

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.275
THAT SOME AGENCIES DO NOT EVEN

00:56:19.342 --> 00:56:20.643
KNOW ABOUT THE LAW.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.345
OTHERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:25.281
FILLS GAPS IN EXISTING LAW.

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:27.684
IN OUR MANY AGENCIES DO NOT HAVE

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:29.319
A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE

00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:32.055

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:32.982
TOGETHER.

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.016
FROM THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.684
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:37.319
PROBATION DEPARTMENT NO SEE

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:39.188
PARKS.

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:40.623
AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN IS AN

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:41.791
IMPORTANT BILL FOR TWO PRINCIPAL

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.359
RATE REASONS.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:46.629
FIRST IT CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW.

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:47.563
THE LAW ALREADY REQUIRES THAT

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:49.465
OFFICER TO BE INFORMED OF THE

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:51.500
NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.068
THIS BILL IS NOT CREATING

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.137
FURTHER PROTECTION AND SIMPLY

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:56.972
CLARIFYING EXISTING ALONG IN A

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:59.842
VERY LIMITED AND PRECISE WAY.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.110
WE HAVE SEEN DEPARTMENTS GIVE

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.645
LITTLE MORE THAN THE CHARGE

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.313
ITSELF AND NO OTHER INFORMATION

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.082
SUCH AS THE DATE TIME.

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.851
OR GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.386
SECOND THE BILL WOULD PROVIDE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:12.054
PRIVILEGE TO THAT PLACE TO SHARE

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:13.389
INFORMATION WITH THEIR LABOR

01:08:13.456 --> 01:08:15.324
REPRESENTATIVES.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:16.792
WE HAVE HAD DEPUTIES TALK TO

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:18.060
THEIR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.795
ABOUT THINGS THEY HAVE SEEN SUCH

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.497
AS WORKING CONDITION STAFFING

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.766
XTERRA.

01:08:23.833 --> 01:08:24.633
AND BE COMPELLED TO DISCLOSE

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:25.668
THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:08:25.734 --> 01:08:28.871
MANAGEMENT.

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:29.271
THIS --

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:31.040
CREATES A CHILLING EFFECT.

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.541
OFFICERS WILL NO LONGER WANT TO

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.010
COME TO US THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.

01:08:35.077 --> 01:08:36.779
AND WE THINK THAT'S SIMPLY WRONG.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.481
WHAT THAT WE REQUEST YOUR YES

01:08:38.547 --> 01:08:40.883
VOTE ON AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:41.317
THANK YOU?

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:45.387
THANK YOU NEXT.

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.590
RESEARCHER MEMBERS JIM LEVIN ON

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:48.757
BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OR

01:08:48.824 --> 01:08:49.658
COUNTY DEPUTY SHERIFF'S ALSO

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:51.126
LONG BEACH POLICE OFFICERS

01:08:51.193 --> 01:08:52.628
ASSOCIATION AND THE FRATERNAL

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:54.964
ORDER OF POLICE --

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:56.866
AGAIN I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:57.500
WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSING

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.334
THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY REALLY

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.035
IMPORTANT AT THIS BILL --

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:02.238
HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.906
WITH CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES OR

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:04.940
VIOLATIONS.

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.876
THINK WE NEED TO FRAME THIS AS A

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:09.278
EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE --

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:11.313
BILL REGARDING THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.282
AND THE DUE PROCESS --

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.916
THAT'S ALREADY ENTITLED TO THESE

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:16.685
OFFICE SO WE ARE SIMPLY

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:19.321
CLARIFYING EXISTING LAW IN TWO

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:20.856
PARTS OF THIS BILL --

01:09:20.923 --> 01:09:23.993
THAT WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH --

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.928
MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS HAS

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.730
BEEN CIRCUMVENTED THIS POINT--

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.998
SO THERE'S CASE LAW ALREADY ON

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.533
THE BOOKS WERE SIMPLY CODIFYING

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:32.034
IN CLARIFYING --

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:34.036
EXISTING LAW --

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:36.505
AGAIN ANY CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

01:09:36.572 --> 01:09:38.440
INVESTIGATION IS SEPARATE THAT'S

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:39.742
A SEPARATE INVESTIGATION ANY

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.810
HEIGHTENED ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:42.878
THAT OFFICER GOES OUT ON A

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:44.580
MINISTRY TO BELIEVE WHAT WE ARE

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:45.881
TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE MORE

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.983
ADMINISTRATIVE INFRACTIONS.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.718
THINGS LIKE WHAT WE SEE

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:50.986
ROUTINELY.

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:52.588
OF BRINGING --

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:55.090
BRINGING DISCIPLINE ON THE BRING

01:09:55.157 --> 01:09:57.159
LIABILITY ON THE DEPARTMENT --

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:58.794
ROOM DISCOURTEOUS TREATMENT IF

01:09:58.861 --> 01:09:59.795
SOMEBODY A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.397
HERE YOU SWEAR --

01:10:01.463 --> 01:10:02.831
THINK ABOUT SIR YOU KNOW TRAFFIC

01:10:02.898 --> 01:10:05.568
STOPS OR TOWING SITUATION IN IN

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:06.769
THE JAIL SETTING IT COULD BE

01:10:06.835 --> 01:10:09.405
THAT THE FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO YOU

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:10.072
THAT WAS COLD AND IT SHOULD BEEN

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:10.839
HOT.

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:11.941
THAT'S A COMPLAINT THEY CAN BE

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.275
REGISTERED AGAINST AN OFFICER

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.277
EVERY SINGLE COMPLAINT HAS TO BE

01:10:15.344 --> 01:10:16.445
INVESTIGATED --

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:18.480
SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE IS

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.815
SIMPLY --

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:22.217
DAYTIME GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.552
AHEAD OF TIME AS THE LAW

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:26.388
REQUIRES A AND THEN PRIVILEGED

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:27.523
COMMUNICATION AROUND THE

COMMUNICATION THAT THAT OFFICER

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:30.726
IN A LABOR SETTING HAS WITH

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.361
THEIR LABOR REPRESENTATIVES THAT

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:36.098
AT THIS POINT HAS --

01:10:36.165 --> 01:10:36.632
THAT APPARENTLY THERE'S A

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.201
LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW SIR IS

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:39.868

WHATEVER REASON FROM THE OFFICER

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:43.839
TO THAT LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IS

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:45.641

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.915
ONE THIRTY SEVEN WE BELIEVE THAT

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.516
THIS BILL WILL IMPEDE EFFECTIVE

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.884
MISCONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS AND

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:37.853
MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO HOLD

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.822
OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.024
COMMIT MISCONDUCT.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.259
I'M CURRENT LAW.

01:12:44.326 --> 01:12:45.661
AS AS I SAID DOES IT DOESN'T

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.029
PRECLUDE HAVING DISCLOSING ANY

01:12:47.096 --> 01:12:48.197
OF THIS INFORMATION DURING AN

01:12:49.331 --> 01:12:52.334
IN FACT IT IS OFTEN PROVIDED I'M

DURING INVESTIGATION --

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:59.208

01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.512

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:04.913

INFORMATION IS ALWAYS READILY

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:07.416
AVAILABLE DURING EVERY

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.118
INVESTIGATION I'M SOMETHING IS

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:10.352
SOMETIMES SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:11.854
THE DATE AND TIME.

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.822
OF THE INCIDENT ISSUE --

01:13:13.889 --> 01:13:16.458
MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OR OR

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:17.626
ACCURATE --

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:18.827
AND THIS COULD BE TO SIMPLY

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:19.862
BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO MADE THE

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.330
COMPLAINT GOT THE DATE WRONG AND

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:22.831
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:13:22.898 --> 01:13:26.001
IF THAT INFORMATION IS NOT

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.637
AVAILABLE OR IF IT IS NOT

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.305
ENTIRELY ACCURATE THAT THAT IS

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.574
NOT A MEANS FOR OVERTURNING ANY

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.942
DISCIPLINE THAT COULD RESULT

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:35.677
FROM.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:36.945
FROM SUSTAIN FINDING MISCONDUCT

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.881
I'M SIMILARLY THE TITLE OF ANY

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:41.316
POLICIES ORDERS RULES PROCEDURES

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.118
OR DIRECTIVES ON IT THIS COULD

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:45.254
ALSO NOT BE FULLY KNOWN AT THE

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.688
ONSET OF AN INVESTIGATION.

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:48.590
THERE COULD BE INFORMATION THAT

01:13:48.657 --> 01:13:49.625
COMES OUT DURING THE COURSE OF

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.994
THE INVESTIGATION THAT MIGHT.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.763
LEAD TO THE AGENCY TO TO WANT TO

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:55.964
INVESTIGATE ANOTHER FORM OF

01:13:56.031 --> 01:13:58.333
MISCONDUCT THAT WASN'T IN THE

01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.468
ORIGINAL COMPLAINT OR THAT

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.103
WASN'T --

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:03.105
THOUGH THE AGENCY WASN'T AWARE

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:03.572
OF AT THE ONSET OF THE

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:06.241
INVESTIGATION.

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.309
SO -- SO

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:07.976
AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:09.411
THAT.

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:10.646
IF AN OFFICER HAS COMMITTED

01:14:10.712 --> 01:14:12.881
ACTUAL MISCONDUCT THAT THEY ARE

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.249
HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT THEY

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.717
ARE THAT THEY ARE DISCIPLINED

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:16.785
AND THAT --

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.086
JUST BECAUSE SOME OF THIS

01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:19.855
INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE THAT

01:14:19.922 --> 01:14:21.190
THAT DOESN'T WHILE THE OFFICER

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.724
TO COMPLETELY AVAILABLE EVADE

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.160
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISCONDUCT.

01:14:25.227 --> 01:14:26.695
I I ALSO JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:29.231
THAT POLICE MISCONDUCT IS VERY

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.666
SERIOUS ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA --

01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:33.468
WIN A COMMUNITY MEMBER.

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.304
HAS CONCERNS ABOUT AN OFFICER'S

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.371
INTEGRITY.

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:39.107
THAT CONCERN NEEDS TO BE --

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.742
MEANING FULLY INVESTIGATED AND

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:43.011
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS IT IS ONLY A

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:44.413
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:46.481
COMPLAINTS OR SUSTAINED IT IS IN

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:47.916
THE SINGLE DIGITS --

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.585
AND IN MANY AGENCIES IT'S LESS

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.854
THAN 5% AND SO THIS IS NOT A

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.888
SYSTEM.

01:14:52.955 --> 01:14:55.924
ALREADY IN WHICH MEMBERS OF THE

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.593
FEEL LIKE THERE ARE CONCERNS ARE

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.595
TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND THAT IS WHY

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.363
MOST PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.432
MISCONDUCT DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.233
FILE A COMPLAINT.

01:15:04.299 --> 01:15:06.268
AND SO WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.236
WILL MAKE THAT PROBLEM EVEN

01:15:07.302 --> 01:15:09.338
WORSE IT'LL RACKED MORE OF A

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.672
SHIELD TO PLEASE ACCOUNTABILITY

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:13.842
SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST.

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:17.279
THANK YOU.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:19.147
MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

01:15:19.214 --> 01:15:22.417
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION --

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:25.187
WE OPPOSE ON AB ONE THIRTY SEVEN

01:15:25.254 --> 01:15:26.021
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT MORE

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:28.323
DIFFICULT TO TAKE CORRUPT OR

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:30.192
ABUSE OF POLICE OFFICERS OFF THE

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.093
STREETS.

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:32.494
AND ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE

01:15:32.561 --> 01:15:33.896
AMENDMENT STATES DON'T GO FAR

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:37.299
ENOUGH --

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.734
THESE THIS BILL WOULD CAUSE

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.036
SERIOUS DAMAGE TO INVESTIGATIONS

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.371
INTO POLICE.

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:43.572
MISCONDUCT.

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:45.807
UP BY PREVENTING INVESTIGATORS

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:48.176
FROM QUESTIONING THE OFFICERS

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:51.813
SUSPECTED ABOUT MISCONDUCT.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.048
I THINK WE NEED TO JUST STEP

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:55.651
BACK A MINUTE AND HISTORICALLY

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:57.519
ON THIS IS PART OF THE POLICE

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.421
OFFICERS BILL OF RIGHTS THESE

01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:01.423
WERE ON BILLS OF RIGHTS WERE

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.925
ENACTED.

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.893
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IT

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.128
WAS A PUSH BACK AGAINST THE

01:16:06.194 --> 01:16:07.896
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.364
AGAINST THE CASES OF POLICE

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:11.366
BRUTALITY THEY WERE ENACTED IN

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.001
THE NUMBER OF STATES.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:14.603
AND SO WHAT WE SEE NOW IS

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:16.972
ANOTHER ATTEMPT IN THE FIVE ON

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.708
THE FACE OF THE CURRENT MOVEMENT.

01:16:19.775 --> 01:16:21.376
TO FOR POLICE TRANSPARENCY TO

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.578
HOLD POLICE OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.647
IS TO EXPAND THAT POLICE OFFICER

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:26.982
BILL OF RIGHTS.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.751
AND THIS IS NOT IN THE INTEREST

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.620
OF THE CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF

01:16:31.687 --> 01:16:32.955
CALIFORNIA.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:34.589
THESE RIGHTS THAT THEY COULD TRY

01:16:34.656 --> 01:16:37.125
TO CHARACTERIZE SAYS EMPLOYER --

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:40.395
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS ARE FAR MORE

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:43.065
EXPENSIVE THAN ANY OTHER CIVIL

01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:45.133
SERVICE EMPLOYEE HAS IN THE

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.034
STATE.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:48.036
THEIR MORE EXPANSIVE THAN ANYONE

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.372
ELSE WHO WOULD BE QUESTIONED

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:51.974
ABOUT MISCONDUCT.

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:54.543
OR ON ANYTHING THAT MIGHT MORPH

01:16:54.609 --> 01:16:56.678
INTO MISCONDUCT WE DON'T GIVE

01:16:56.745 --> 01:17:01.650
SPECIAL RIGHTS. TO MILITARY SO

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.719
OF SPECIAL RIGHTS TO FIREMAN WE

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.587
DON'T GIVE SPECIAL RIGHTS TO THE

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:06.688
MENTALLY ILL.

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:10.359
SO THERE IS NO REASON THAT THESE

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.760
PUBLIC SERVANTS.

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.596
WHO SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:16.665
PUBLIC SHOULD BE GIVEN THE

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:17.933
SPECIAL RIGHTS?

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.403
AND WE KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THAT

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.571
THERE ARE --

01:17:22.637 --> 01:17:24.473
FREQUENTLY ARISES THE NEED TO

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.274
QUESTION POLICE OFFICERS IN THE

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:28.276
STATE AND THAT SOMETIMES THAT

01:17:28.343 --> 01:17:30.045
DOES --

01:17:30.112 --> 01:17:33.715
BECOME ABOUT SERIOUS MISCONDUCT.

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:35.951
AND WE HAVE THE EXAMPLES --

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:37.552
JUST THIS MORNING THERE WAS

01:19:47.482 --> 01:19:48.950
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.418
AGAIN MAY CAUSE AN INVESTIGATION

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:54.890
OF ON NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:56.424
MERITORIOUS TO THE DISCIPLINE

01:19:56.491 --> 01:19:58.260
ITSELF THAT WAS TO THE ACTION

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.361

PUTTING AMENDMENT IN THE BILL

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:33.195
WHICH WOULD SAY IF THAT

INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:38.500
OR THERE'S AN HONEST MISTAKE IN

01:20:38.567 --> 01:20:39.701
GIVING THE DATE AT SAID OR YOU

01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:42.237

THIS IS THEY ALREADY HAVE THE

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:46.007
RIGHT FOR SOME INFORMATION THIS

01:20:46.074 --> 01:20:48.009

WERE SOMETHING PUT IN THE BILL

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:50.979
SUCH THAT --

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:53.415
DO YOU THINK THIS IS TOO MUCH

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:55.317
INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN OR DO

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.351
YOU.

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:58.353
YOU KNOW IF IT ISN'T TOO MUCH

01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.755
COULD THIS BE THEN --

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.757
REMEDY BY AN AMENDMENT TO THE

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:04.426
BILL IF SAYING THAT --

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.628
IF THE DATE WASN'T KNOWN OR IF

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.563
THE INFORMATION WASN'T KNOWN IT

01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:11.333
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE GIVEN.

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:12.100
IT'S NOT IT THROUGH THE CHURCH

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.702
ON AMENDMENT WE'VE SUGGESTED IF

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:14.903
IT WERE ON THE TABLE WE

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.608
BUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS WHAT

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.042
BEFORE ISN'T EITHER IT DOES

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:23.245
SOMETHING EITHER IT EXPANDS THE

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:24.679
INFORMATION THAT HAS TO BE GIVEN.

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:26.314
OR IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING IF IT

01:21:26.381 --> 01:21:28.416
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BEN NOT SURE

01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:29.517
WHY WE NEED A BILL EIGHT BUT IN

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:32.387
YOUR OPINION THIS DOES EXPAND

EXPANSION OF THE INFORMATION OR

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:05.654
I THINK IT --

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.455

A BILL BEFORE FOR THIS COMMITTEE

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.262
I THINK IT CERTAINLY CAN BE READ

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:15.897
AS AN EXPANSION I THINK THAT YOU

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:17.499

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.434
OFFENSE ISN'T TO FIND.

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.835

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.341
DEPENDS HOW HOW WE WOULD DEFINE

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.276
A GENERAL CHARACTERIZATION OF

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.512
THE CONDUCT --

01:22:30.578 --> 01:22:33.214
AND AND AND SO I THINK THAT IT.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.450
IT'S CAN CERTAINLY BE

01:22:35.517 --> 01:22:37.519
INTERPRETED AS AS AN EXPANSION.

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.587

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:41.022
EXPANSION YES.

THERE IS THE WAY IT'S DONE IN

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:53.768
PRACTICE BUT FOR PURPOSES OF LAW.

01:22:53.835 --> 01:22:55.637
AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS DOES

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:57.372
NOT APPLY TO ANY PROCEEDINGS

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.740
WHERE THERE'S ALSO CRIMINAL

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.275
PROCEEDINGS IN NATURE.

01:23:00.342 --> 01:23:02.143
AS I READ THE BILL THERE'S TWO

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.012
CLAUSES THAT NARROW IT THERE IS

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:05.347
THE OPENING PARAGRAPH AND THEN

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:06.648
SECTION J..

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.249
SECTION JAY SAYS THAT THE

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:11.519
SECTION TURNS SOLELY WITH

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.288
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES SO AS I READ

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.055
THAT IF THEIR CRIMINAL

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:15.790
ACTIVITIES AND OTHER THINGS THAT

ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THIS

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.660
WOULD APPLY IS THAT YOUR

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.395
UNDERSTANDING.

01:23:20.462 --> 01:23:22.497
SO ERTAINLY IN THIS WAS TOUCH

01:23:22.564 --> 01:23:23.832
UPON BY THE OPPOSITION THIS

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:26.401
DOESN'T PRECLUDE IF IN IT IF.

01:23:26.468 --> 01:23:28.403
THE OFFICERS BROUGHT IN ON AN

01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.904
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.573
AND ONE SIDE INVESTIGATION AND

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.341
SUSAN QUESTIONING BEGINS AND

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.210
THEN IT TRANSITIONS INTO ANOTHER

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:36.811
ISSUE THAT MAY HAVE CRIMINALITY

01:23:36.878 --> 01:23:37.679
THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.247
PRECLUDES THAT FROM HAPPENING.

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.949
A TIME OUT IS GIVEN THE RIDDLER

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:42.817
WERE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.251

01:23:43.318 --> 01:23:44.252
REPRESENTATIVE OR THEIR WITH

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.720
THEIR ATTORNEY AT SAID IT

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:49.023
DOESN'T PRECLUDE OR STOP ANY

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.191
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.559
RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT MY

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.128
CONCERN SO HERE'S MY CONCERN ON

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.229
THE HYPOTHETICAL WE HAVE A

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.296
POLICE OFFICER IS BEING

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.631
INVESTIGATED FOR SEVERAL THINGS

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:57.832
SUMMER THE MINOR THINGS THAT

01:23:57.899 --> 01:23:58.933
YOU'VE MENTIONED.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:23:59.701
IN ADDITION THERE ARE

01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:01.202
ALLEGATIONS OF SAY SEXUAL

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:01.936
ASSAULT.

01:24:02.003 --> 01:24:03.371
THE INVESTIGATOR KNOWS OF ONE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:04.806
ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.574
LET'S SAY THEY WERE FIVE SEXUAL

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:08.576
ASSAULT INCIDENTS WHEN ALL OF A

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.644
SUDDEN THIS OFFICER KNOWS

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:11.212
EXACTLY WHAT THE INVESTIGATOR

01:24:11.279 --> 01:24:12.046
KNOWS IT LIMITS THE

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:13.381
INVESTIGATORS ABILITY TO

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.349
UNDERSTAND.

01:24:14.416 --> 01:24:15.550
THE SCOPE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:24:15.617 --> 01:24:17.919
AND SO BY GIVING THIS MUCH

01:24:17.986 --> 01:24:19.354
INFORMATION I THINK WE'VE NOW.

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.256
HAND CUFF TO THE INVESTIGATOR

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:22.557
INTO REALLY GETTING TO THE

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.359
BOTTOM OF WHAT'S GOING ON NOT

01:24:24.426 --> 01:24:26.194
ALL ALL INTERJECT ON THAT --

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.195
IN AND WITH REASON IS I SAW WAS

01:24:27.262 --> 01:24:28.830
A CAPTAIN FOR THIRTY YEARS I WAS

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:29.931
A MANAGER CITED HIS

01:24:29.998 --> 01:24:31.699
INVESTIGATION SUFFERS A SERIOUS

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:32.200
CHARGES RATE.

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:33.701
THAT BE A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.869
IT WOULD NOT BE IN THE MINISTRY

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:35.804
OF INVESTIGATION.

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.372
RACE SO WHERE ANALYZE THAT

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:38.740
STATED THAT'S WHAT I DON'T

01:24:38.807 --> 01:24:40.341
UNDERSTAND IS I READ THIS LAW

01:24:40.408 --> 01:24:42.243
YOU COULD HAVE BOTH HAPPENING

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:43.711
SIMULTANEOUSLY RIGHT NO AND I

01:24:43.778 --> 01:24:45.113
UNDERSTAND A PRACTICE THAT MAY

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:46.881
NOT HAPPEN WHAT I'M SAYING

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:48.283
THOUGH IF IT'S I UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:50.919
WHAT I'M SAYING IS IF AN

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:53.955
ALLEGATION SURFACES A FELONY OR

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.223
SERIOUS CRIME?

01:24:55.290 --> 01:24:56.825
IT WILL BE TREATED AS A CRIMINAL

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:57.992
INVESTIGATION NOT THE MYSTERY

01:24:58.059 --> 01:24:59.561
INVESTIGATION THAT'S THAT'S HOW

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:00.829
IT'S DONE.

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:02.096
AND THAT WE REPRESENTS FROM C.

01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.565
H. P. AND OTHER AGENCIES IN HERE

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:06.000
THAT CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IF

01:25:06.067 --> 01:25:07.135
THAT ALLEGATION SURFACES.

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:08.303
IT'S GOING TO BE TREATED AS SUCH

01:25:08.369 --> 01:25:10.405
NOT A LESSER NOT A LESSER YOU

01:25:10.472 --> 01:25:12.140

GIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS RIGHT AND

01:25:20.982 --> 01:25:22.116
THAT'S MY CONCERN SO WHATEVER'S

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:23.351
HAPPENING PRACTICES ONE THING I

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:24.352
RESPECT THAT.

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:27.822
I READ THE OPENING PARAGRAPH IT

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.224
CAN APPLY TO ANY ACTION THAT

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.492

EXCLUDE THINGS THAT ARE SOLELY

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:39.033
CRIMINAL.

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:39.667
BUT NOT THINGS THAT ARE MIXED IN

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:41.369
NATURE.

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:43.371

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.226
THAT.

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.095
WHEN ALLEGATIONS ARE BROUGHT

01:33:21.162 --> 01:33:21.696

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.496
OCCUR?

01:33:22.563 --> 01:33:24.832
AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE KINDS

01:33:24.899 --> 01:33:29.070
OF REQUESTS OR ARE PARTS OF THE

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.705

DOES IS STRENGTHENED.

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:33.808

THE INVESTIGATION AND SO I I I

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:37.478
THINK IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT

01:33:37.545 --> 01:33:39.947

PROCESS AND SO I WILL TELL YOU

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:45.786
THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IS?

01:33:45.853 --> 01:33:47.121
IS NOT ONLY REASONABLE BUT

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.123
PROBABLY NO PORTENT THINK YOUR

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:53.361

I JUST WANNA KNOW.

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.197
BASICALLY WHAT'S THE

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:57.198
SIGNIFICANCE OF ASKING ABOUT THE

CDC OURS EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:13.299
OVERCROWDING THAT THEY HAVE DONE --

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:16.235
WITH I WOULD SAY SOME SO THE

02:01:16.302 --> 02:01:18.270
LAST SEVEN EIGHT YEARS TO

02:01:18.337 --> 02:01:19.538

COURT ORDERED POPULATION

02:01:21.107 --> 02:01:22.408

BEEN HELPFUL IN THAT EFFORT --

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:28.714
I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE CASE FOR

02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:30.583
OTHER.

02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:34.053
USES OR METHODS OR APPROACHES IN

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.823
WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE SEE

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:39.458
POTENTIALLY HAPPEN AND IS ONE OF

02:01:39.525 --> 02:01:41.027
TWO THINGS --

02:01:41.093 --> 02:01:42.428
ONE IF WE TAKE AWAY TOOL TO DEAL

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:43.829
WITH OVERCROWDING.

02:01:43.896 --> 02:01:44.630
WE DON'T ADDRESS THE

02:01:44.697 --> 02:01:46.098
OVERCROWDING AND WE END UP WITH

02:01:46.165 --> 02:01:47.533
PEOPLE BEING RELEASED UNDER THE

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:53.839
COMPLIANCE OFFICER WHO HAS THE

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:55.007
AUTHORITY TO RELEASE PEOPLE AND

02:01:55.074 --> 02:01:56.742
SO IF THIS OPTION IS NOT

02:01:56.809 --> 02:01:57.910
AVAILABLE --

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:59.211

02:01:59.278 --> 02:02:00.212
OTHERS SONORA THAT WERE

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:01.614
CONCERNED ABOUT AND I WOULD SAY

02:02:01.681 --> 02:02:02.882
TOO MUCH HIGHER DEGREE.

02:02:02.948 --> 02:02:05.084
IS ONE THAT INCREASES PRESSURE

02:02:05.151 --> 02:02:06.619
TO HOUSE MORE FELONS AND COUNTY

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:08.654

FELONS IN OUR JAILS THAT WE DID

02:02:16.095 --> 02:02:18.898

WE TAKE A TOOL OUT OF THE TOOL

02:02:43.556 --> 02:02:45.291
BOX THAT CREATES MORE PRESSURE

02:02:45.357 --> 02:02:46.258

WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THIS

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:01.474
INCREASED PRESSURE TO HAVE MORE

02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.175
PEOPLE IN COUNTY JAILS --

02:03:03.242 --> 02:03:04.443

02:06:02.221 --> 02:06:03.322
THE STATE LEVEL WHERE THEY HAVE

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.556

UNFORTUNATELY THE SAN BERNARDINO

02:13:11.116 --> 02:13:12.884
THEIR OPINION.

02:13:12.951 --> 02:13:14.319
BECAUSE THE ONLY REASON THE

02:13:14.386 --> 02:13:16.488
DEFENDANT CANNOT PAY THE FINE

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:18.023

IN OTHER WORDS IT COSTS MORE TO

02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:09.194
GUNS TEMPORARILY OUT OF THE

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.862
HANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:21:10.929 --> 02:21:12.397
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE POSSESSING

02:21:12.463 --> 02:21:12.597
THEM.

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:15.967
THIS LEGISLATION EXPANDS WHO CAN

02:21:16.034 --> 02:21:17.502
ASK FOR A GUN BONTA STRAINING

02:21:17.569 --> 02:21:19.037
ORDER FROM THE COURT TO

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:20.572
TEMPORARILY TAKE A GUN AWAY.

02:21:20.638 --> 02:21:21.873
CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION FALLS

02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:23.174
WITH FAMILY MEMBERS AS WELL AS

02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:24.375
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:21:24.442 --> 02:21:26.010
THIS WOULD EXPAND IT TO PEOPLE

02:21:26.077 --> 02:21:27.846
WHO ARE CO WORKERS EMPLOYERS AS

02:21:27.912 --> 02:21:29.681
WELL AS PEOPLE WHO YOU GO TO

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:32.283
SCHOOL WITH SO ADMINISTRATORS

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:33.685
TEACHERS PROFESSORS.

02:21:33.751 --> 02:21:34.886
AND THE REASON IS AS WE'VE SEEN

02:21:34.953 --> 02:21:37.088
FAR TOO MANY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AS

02:21:37.155 --> 02:21:39.624
WELL AS WORKPLACE SHOOTINGS.

02:21:39.691 --> 02:21:42.493
WE SAW ALSO IN THIS SITUATION IN

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:44.762
VENTURA COUNTY WE HAD ACTUALLY

02:21:44.829 --> 02:21:47.131
LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:21:47.198 --> 02:21:48.399
COULD HAVE TAKEN THE GUN AWAY

02:21:48.466 --> 02:21:49.801
INTERACTED WITH THE GOVERNMENT

02:21:49.868 --> 02:21:50.869
AND THEN.

02:21:50.935 --> 02:21:52.737
DID NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH IT

02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:53.671
UNFORTUNATELY --

02:21:53.738 --> 02:21:55.974
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE

02:21:56.040 --> 02:21:57.375
GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN HAD A

02:21:57.442 --> 02:21:58.743
VETO MESSAGE THAT HE THOUGHT

02:21:58.810 --> 02:22:00.044
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD WORK THROUGH

02:22:00.111 --> 02:22:01.679
LAW ENFORCEMENT WE DON'T WE

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:02.814
DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT?

02:22:02.881 --> 02:22:04.148
BUT THIS ALLOWS PEOPLE THE

02:22:04.215 --> 02:22:06.684
OPTION IF AFTER DISCUSSING THE

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:07.652
ISSUE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW

02:22:07.719 --> 02:22:08.686
ENFORCEMENT NOT INTERESTED IN

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:10.154
MOVING FORWARD.

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.357
THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO GO TO COURT

02:22:12.423 --> 02:22:13.825
TO PETITION THE COURT PETITION A

02:22:13.892 --> 02:22:15.026
JUDGE IN AGAIN IT'S PETITIONING

02:22:15.093 --> 02:22:16.261
A JUDGE IT'S NOT.

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:17.128
IT'S IT'S A VERY STANDARD

02:22:17.195 --> 02:22:19.597
PROCESS THAT PEOPLE USE ALSO FOR

02:22:19.664 --> 02:22:21.699
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING

02:22:21.766 --> 02:22:23.101

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:25.069
VERY HAPPY TO SEE MORE OR MORE

OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:38.216

02:22:38.283 --> 02:22:40.151

ON THEIR COUPLE EXAMPLES THAT

02:23:50.388 --> 02:23:51.489
I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE

02:23:51.556 --> 02:23:53.925
PARKLAND SHOOTING OF COURSE IN

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:55.326
THAT INSTANCE THE SHOOTER WAS

02:23:55.393 --> 02:23:57.261
WELL KNOWN TO TEACHERS.

02:23:57.328 --> 02:24:00.665
OBSESSION WITH FIREARMS AND THEN

02:24:00.732 --> 02:24:03.101
IN THE AURORA ILLINOIS A

02:24:03.167 --> 02:24:05.269
SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED LESS THAN

02:24:05.336 --> 02:24:07.372
TWO WEEKS AGO --

02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:10.008
IT'S AND I FIND IT ON THAT.

02:24:10.074 --> 02:24:11.876
DISCONCERTING THAT I CAN TAKE AN

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:13.911
EXAMPLE THAT SO WE SENT.

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:16.581
V. BACKGROUND CHECKS FAILED AND

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:17.682
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXACT

02:24:17.749 --> 02:24:19.050
CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE

02:24:19.117 --> 02:24:22.387
SHOOTING BUT THE SHOOTER HAD

02:24:22.453 --> 02:24:24.322
PREVIOUS CRIMINAL.

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:25.390
RECORD.

02:24:25.456 --> 02:24:27.525
AND YET LAW ENFORCEMENT DID NOT

02:24:27.592 --> 02:24:29.127
ACT.

02:24:29.193 --> 02:24:31.996
HE WAS FIRED JUST BEFORE BEFORE

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:33.664
THE SHOOTING.

02:24:33.731 --> 02:24:35.333
THE EMPLOYER THAT HE HAD.

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.568
BEEN MADE THREATS EMPLOYERS CO

02:24:37.635 --> 02:24:39.604
WORKERS KNEW THAT THERE WAS.

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:41.839
HE WAS IRAQ TECH INDIVIDUAL AND

02:24:41.906 --> 02:24:43.608
SO ULTIMATELY --

02:24:43.674 --> 02:24:44.776
WE THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE

02:24:44.842 --> 02:24:46.744
PROACTIVE IN OUR GUN VIOLENCE

02:24:46.811 --> 02:24:49.180
PREVENTION LAWS AND SO WE

02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:51.082
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR PRIVATE.

02:24:51.149 --> 02:24:52.683
THANK YOU YES.

AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF THE

CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY

02:24:55.720 --> 02:24:57.889
CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE

02:24:57.955 --> 02:24:59.791
AS I MENTIONED IN TESTIMONY

02:24:59.857 --> 02:25:04.062
EARLIER TODAY 97% OF COMBINES

02:25:04.128 --> 02:25:06.464
RESTRAINING ORDERS ISSUED FAST

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:08.966
FAR HAVE BEEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:25:09.033 --> 02:25:11.102
I ACTUALLY DO NOT EXPECT THAT TO

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:14.072
CHANGE MUCH BY THE TIME A

02:25:14.138 --> 02:25:15.606
CONCERNED PERSON.

02:25:15.673 --> 02:25:17.608
IS READY TO TAKE THIS STEP TO GO

02:25:17.675 --> 02:25:19.343
TO COURT AND FILE A PETITION

02:25:19.410 --> 02:25:21.112
IT'S PROBABLY RAISE TO THE LEVEL

02:25:21.179 --> 02:25:23.081
OF EMERGENCY.

02:25:23.147 --> 02:25:24.982
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT --

02:25:25.049 --> 02:25:26.951
SHOULD BE CAUGHT AND IS USUALLY

02:25:27.018 --> 02:25:27.819
CAUGHT.

02:25:27.885 --> 02:25:29.487
HOWEVER --

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:30.755
THERE TIMES AS WE SAW IN

02:25:30.822 --> 02:25:33.658
PARKLAND PERHAPS IN BORDERLINE

02:25:33.724 --> 02:25:34.659
BAR AND GRILL AND I KNOW IT'S

02:25:34.725 --> 02:25:36.594
ALWAYS EASY TO SECOND GUESS

02:25:36.661 --> 02:25:37.862
THESE THINGS ON HIND SIGHT.

02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:39.097
BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE TIMES

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:41.099
WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY BE

02:25:41.165 --> 02:25:43.534
UNRESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERN.

02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:46.237
OR WHEN UP CONCERN PARTY MAY BE

02:25:46.304 --> 02:25:47.972
RELUCTANT CO TO GO TO LAW

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:49.640
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF THEIR

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:51.409
LEGAL STATUS. FOR EXAMPLE

02:25:51.476 --> 02:25:55.113
UNDOCUMENTED PERSON IN THE STATE --

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:57.315
IN THOSE CASES I THINK IT IS

02:25:57.381 --> 02:25:59.350
OPTION TO PETITION THE COURT.

02:25:59.417 --> 02:26:01.519
THEMSELVES.

02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:03.855
I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S

02:26:03.921 --> 02:26:06.190
ARGUMENT I CARE ABOUT TO PROCESS

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:07.725
THE FACT THAT GUNS CAN BE TAKEN

02:26:07.792 --> 02:26:10.695
AWAY BEFORE HEARING --

02:26:10.761 --> 02:26:12.997
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN.

02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:15.600
I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT --

02:26:15.666 --> 02:26:17.768

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:25.443
PROHIBITIONS DUE TO MENTAL

02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:27.879
ILLNESS STRICTLY THE FIFTY ONE

02:26:27.945 --> 02:26:29.046
FIFTY LAW --

02:26:29.113 --> 02:26:30.581

02:26:30.648 --> 02:26:33.384

02:26:40.658 --> 02:26:41.592
TWENTY ONE DAYS.

02:26:41.659 --> 02:26:43.928
THE WORST THAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:26:43.995 --> 02:26:45.329
THERE IS AN ACTION WHEN THERE

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:46.697
COULD HAVE BEEN AND SHOULD HAVE

02:26:46.764 --> 02:26:47.665

PERSON'S RECORD OF WEALTHY AFTER

SO I KNOW THAT --

02:28:23.194 --> 02:28:23.828
THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.730

THIS BILL CERTAINLY --

02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.348
THESE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE SEEN

02:28:44.415 --> 02:28:46.584
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE VERY

02:28:46.651 --> 02:28:49.520
SERIOUS AND WE NEED TO TO TAKE

02:28:49.587 --> 02:28:51.188

COMPROMISING CIVIL LIBERTIES AND

02:28:56.327 --> 02:28:58.062
UNFORTUNATELY WE WE DO THINK

02:28:58.129 --> 02:28:59.997
THAT THIS BILL WOULD IT

02:29:00.064 --> 02:29:01.899
UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S DUE PROCESS

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:04.635
RIGHTS -- WE

02:29:04.702 --> 02:29:06.037
ARE NOT OPPOSED TO GUN CONTROL

02:29:06.103 --> 02:29:07.838
MEASURES THAT THAT PROTECT

02:29:07.905 --> 02:29:10.775
PEOPLE TO PROCESS RIGHTS AND AND

02:29:10.841 --> 02:29:12.510
AND CIVIL RIGHTS WE ARE NOT

02:29:12.576 --> 02:29:14.111
OPPOSED TO EVEN REMOVING GUNS

FROM PEOPLE WHO POSE A DANGER TO

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:16.681
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS.

02:29:16.747 --> 02:29:18.049
PROVIDED THAT THERE IS THERE ARE

02:29:18.115 --> 02:29:20.017
NOT NON DISCRIMINATORY CRITERIA

02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:21.986
INVOLVED AND THAT THERE IS

02:29:22.053 --> 02:29:22.920
SUFFICIENT REDUCTION FOR DUE

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:24.922
PROCESS WE DID NOT OPPOSE THE

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:26.257
CREATION OF THE G. VIEIRA SYSTEM

02:29:26.324 --> 02:29:29.994
MEAN IN CALIFORNIA --

02:29:30.061 --> 02:29:32.596
THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:35.032
SIX AS A RESTRAINING ORDERS AS

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:37.368
WE'VE HEARD FROM --

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:38.836
ONE OF PROPONENTS THAT THAT SOME

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.338
PEOPLE ARE CLOSER TO THEIR CO

02:29:40.404 --> 02:29:41.205
WORKERS THAN THEY ARE TO THE

02:29:41.272 --> 02:29:42.206
FAMILY --

02:29:42.273 --> 02:29:43.507
THAT IS YOUR SOME PEOPLE IT IS

02:29:43.574 --> 02:29:45.042
NOT TRUE OF OF ALL PEOPLE THEIR

02:29:45.109 --> 02:29:47.011
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WITH TENS

02:29:47.078 --> 02:29:48.579
OF THOUSANDS OF CO WORKERS.

02:29:48.646 --> 02:29:50.948
AND UNDER THIS BILL ANY ONE OF

02:29:51.015 --> 02:29:52.516
THOSE PEOPLE COULD SEEK AS A GUN

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:54.518
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER --

02:29:54.585 --> 02:29:56.420
YES THERE IS A JUDGE INVOLVED

02:29:56.487 --> 02:29:57.988
WITH THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ONE

02:29:58.055 --> 02:29:59.256
SIDE ONE SIDE PETITIONS THE

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:01.359
JUDGE THE JUDGE ONLY HERE'S ONE

02:30:01.425 --> 02:30:03.327
SIDE THEY DO NOT HEAR FROM THE

02:30:03.394 --> 02:30:05.029
OTHER PERSON --

02:30:05.096 --> 02:30:06.897
I'M REFERRING TO THE EX PARTY --

02:30:06.964 --> 02:30:09.633
RESTRAINING ORDERS AND THE OTHER

02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:11.001
PERSON NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT

02:30:11.068 --> 02:30:12.770
THERE THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT

02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:14.038
THIS IS TAKING PLACE THE ONLY

02:30:14.105 --> 02:30:15.706
WAY THAT THEY FIND OUT.

02:30:15.773 --> 02:30:17.808
IS THAT AN OFFICER SHOWS UP AT

02:30:17.875 --> 02:30:19.877
THEIR DOOR --

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:21.545
TO TO CONFISCATE WEAPONS --

02:30:21.612 --> 02:30:23.214
THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:24.749
BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME THEY

02:30:24.815 --> 02:30:25.883
HAVE NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF MAKING

02:30:25.950 --> 02:30:27.685
CRIMINAL THREATS THEY'VE NOT

02:30:27.752 --> 02:30:28.719
BEEN ACCUSED OF OF COMMITTING

02:30:28.786 --> 02:30:29.587
VIOLENCE.

02:30:29.653 --> 02:30:32.022
AND THEY THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY

02:30:32.089 --> 02:30:35.159
POSSESS ANY FARMS BUT WHEN AN

02:30:35.226 --> 02:30:36.394
OFFICER COME TO THEIR DOOR

02:30:36.460 --> 02:30:38.396
EXPECTING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.331
MAY BE DANGEROUS AND SOMEONE

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:41.799
HIGH UP TO THIS IS FIREARMS WE

02:30:41.866 --> 02:30:43.000
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THAT

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:46.203
ENCOUNTER --

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:46.804
MIGHT HAPPEN AND WHETHER THAT

02:30:46.871 --> 02:30:49.173
MIGHT.

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:52.243
SO OUR CONCERN IS.

02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:53.844
NECESSARILY WITH A PERSON.

02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.813
LOSING.

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.882
THEIR THEIR FARMS FOR TWENTY ONE

02:30:57.948 --> 02:31:00.184
DAYS IT IS ALSO ABOUT THE SEARCH

02:31:00.251 --> 02:31:01.719
THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE --

02:31:01.786 --> 02:31:03.254
THAT WE FEEL LIKE.

02:31:03.320 --> 02:31:04.989
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WITHOUT

02:31:05.055 --> 02:31:05.956
SUFFICIENT TO PROCESS.

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:08.459
ARE I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:10.227
REGARDING THE SCHOOLS THIS WOULD

02:31:10.294 --> 02:31:12.463
ALLOW I'M AN EMPLOYEE AT A

02:31:12.530 --> 02:31:13.164
SCHOOL.

02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:15.332
WHO HAD BEEN THERE IN THE PAST

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:16.567
SIX MONTHS WOULD ENCOUNTER THE

02:31:16.634 --> 02:31:18.803
STUDENT IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS?

02:31:18.869 --> 02:31:20.571
TO SEE CONNECTS PARTY COME

02:31:20.638 --> 02:31:22.506
BOUNCES RUNNING ORDER THE WHOLE

02:31:22.573 --> 02:31:23.407
PURPOSE OF A GUN FOR VIOLENCE

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:25.209
RESTRAINING OF AN EX PARTE ORDER

02:31:25.276 --> 02:31:27.912
IS THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION.

02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:30.815
AND SO THE FACT THAT A PERSON

02:31:30.881 --> 02:31:33.818
MIGHT NOT HAVE AND ENCOUNTERED A

02:31:33.884 --> 02:31:36.287
STUDENT FOR SIX MONTHS SEEMS.

02:31:36.353 --> 02:31:38.155
TO NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:31:38.222 --> 02:31:41.358
URGENCY OF THESE TYPES OF

02:31:41.425 --> 02:31:44.128
RESTRAINING ORDERS.

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:45.095
OZ SO.

02:31:45.162 --> 02:31:45.996
OF FOR THESE REASONS WE DO THINK

02:31:46.063 --> 02:31:47.798
THAT THIS BILL WOULD HAVE A

02:31:47.865 --> 02:31:49.967
DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT --

02:31:50.034 --> 02:31:52.403
YOU KNOW IN PART BECAUSE THERE

02:31:52.470 --> 02:31:54.171
ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE IRRATIONAL

02:31:54.238 --> 02:31:55.573
FEARS OF PEOPLE BASED ON THEIR

02:31:55.639 --> 02:31:57.475
RELIGION BASED ON THEIR ON THEIR

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:58.375
RACE --

02:31:58.442 --> 02:32:00.211
CERTAINLY CO WORKERS CAN HARBOR

02:32:00.277 --> 02:32:01.612
THOSE FEARS OF OTHER COWORKERS

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:03.614
AND SO WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS

02:32:03.681 --> 02:32:05.015
IS SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT PEOPLE

02:32:05.082 --> 02:32:06.917
SEE PROCESS RIGHT SO FOR FOR

02:32:06.984 --> 02:32:07.451
THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST

02:32:07.518 --> 02:32:07.751
[inaudible]

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:12.356
THANK YOU.

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:12.990
MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:13.357
THE COMMITTEE.

DâN READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:16.193
ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR C. R.

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:17.261
PA -- IN

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:18.929
OPPOSITION --

02:32:18.996 --> 02:32:20.364
AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE FROM THE

02:32:20.431 --> 02:32:21.332
ACLU IS POINTED OUT THAT THE DUE

02:32:21.398 --> 02:32:22.666
PROCESS PROTECTIONS IN THE

02:32:22.733 --> 02:32:24.368
UNDERLYING CONCEPT HERE OR JUST

02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:25.336
INADEQUATE.

02:32:25.402 --> 02:32:26.437
WHO WERE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S

02:32:26.504 --> 02:32:27.404
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS THESE ARE

02:32:27.471 --> 02:32:28.806
PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:29.940
OF A CRIME ADJUDICATED MENTALLY

02:32:30.007 --> 02:32:30.841
ILL?

02:32:30.908 --> 02:32:32.710
AND WERE GETTING THIRD PARTY

02:32:32.776 --> 02:32:35.379
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE AND I THINK

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:37.248
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT ONLY

02:32:37.314 --> 02:32:38.282
LOOK AT THIS BILL IN THE THE

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.150
SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF WHO CAN

02:32:40.217 --> 02:32:41.619
BE A REPORTER --

02:32:41.685 --> 02:32:43.153
COLLEAGUES --

02:32:43.220 --> 02:32:44.188
COWORKERS --

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:46.056
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO LOOK

02:32:46.123 --> 02:32:46.891
AT SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT

02:32:46.957 --> 02:32:48.192
ARE DEALING WITH THE SAME TOPIC

02:32:48.259 --> 02:32:49.026
THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.194
ENCOUNTER INCLUDING.

02:32:50.261 --> 02:32:52.429
EXTENDING GBR ROSE OUT TO FIVE

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:53.330
YEARS -- I

02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:54.198
BELIEVE THERE'S A BILL THAT

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:55.499
ELIMINATES NOTICE THESE ARE

02:32:55.566 --> 02:32:57.134
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER.

02:32:57.201 --> 02:32:58.502
WHEN WE'RE GONNA SAY SOMEONE SO

02:32:58.569 --> 02:32:59.603
DANGEROUS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:00.971
TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS WITHOUT A

02:33:01.038 --> 02:33:05.209
HEARING FOR SEVERAL WEEKS --

02:33:05.276 --> 02:33:06.176
AND NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE WE'RE

02:33:06.243 --> 02:33:07.311
NOT OFFERING MANY MIDDLE HEALTH

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:08.445
TREATMENT WE'RE NOT DOING

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:10.314
ANYTHING ELSE TO CONTROL ANY

02:33:10.381 --> 02:33:10.981
OTHER DANGERS BEHAVIOR THAT WE

02:33:11.048 --> 02:33:11.815
CAN HAVE.

02:33:11.882 --> 02:33:13.050
WE'RE JUST FOCUSING ON ON

02:33:13.117 --> 02:33:15.386
FIREARMS RIGHT SO WE NEED TO

02:33:15.452 --> 02:33:17.288
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN --

02:33:17.354 --> 02:33:18.422
WORK ON CRIME CONTROL WORK ON

02:33:18.489 --> 02:33:19.590
GETTING MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

02:33:19.657 --> 02:33:20.891
OUT THERE NOT JUST.

02:33:20.958 --> 02:33:22.426
TAKING SOMEONE'S GUNS WITHOUT

02:33:22.493 --> 02:33:23.861
DUE PROCESS --

02:33:23.928 --> 02:33:26.096
AND THESE ORDERS CAN BE EXTENDED

02:33:26.163 --> 02:33:28.399
RIGHT AND SO FOR LOOKING AT

CONVICTED OF A CRIME --

02:33:37.207 --> 02:33:38.642
MY COLLEAGUE HERE MENTIONED --

02:33:38.709 --> 02:33:40.010
ABOUT THE INTERACTION POLICE

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:41.211
WHEN I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:33:41.278 --> 02:33:42.446
LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS NOT A

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:43.747
SINGLE OFFICER GOING OUT

02:33:43.814 --> 02:33:46.083
KNOCKING ON YOUR DOOR AND SAYING --

TIME HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GO OUT

02:33:59.830 --> 02:34:00.664
ON THE SO.

02:34:00.731 --> 02:34:01.799
I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:02.866
THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WE

02:34:02.933 --> 02:34:04.168

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.408
UNDERSTAND PERCENT BRITISH

02:34:11.475 --> 02:34:12.209
REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:14.211
CALIFORNIA ONE ECHO THE CONCERNS

02:34:14.278 --> 02:34:16.981
OF OF THAT HAVE BEEN STATED HERE --

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:18.449
IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY TREAT

02:34:18.515 --> 02:34:20.017
PEOPLE THAT ARE ARRESTED FOR A

02:34:20.084 --> 02:34:22.052
CRIME BETTER THAN WE DO PEOPLE

02:34:22.119 --> 02:34:24.254
WHO SOMEONE THINKS THAT MAYBE.

02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:25.956
THEY ARE A DANGER TO THEMSELVES

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:27.524
OR OTHERS WHEN YOU ARRESTED AND

02:34:27.591 --> 02:34:29.460
TAKEN TO JAIL YOU'VE GOT TWENTY

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:30.127
FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS BEFORE

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:30.828
YOU HAVE TO GO.

02:34:30.894 --> 02:34:32.129
AND GET AN ARRAIGNMENT SO YOU

02:34:32.196 --> 02:34:33.497
HAVE YOUR DAY IN COURT.

02:34:33.564 --> 02:34:35.933
QUICKLY IN THIS CASE YOU HAVE

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:37.334
TWENTY ONE DAYS WHERE YOU

02:34:37.401 --> 02:34:39.236
JUSTICE IS DELAYED AND AS MARTIN

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:41.071
LUTHER KING SAID IN LETTERS FROM

02:34:41.138 --> 02:34:41.805
PRISON.

02:34:41.872 --> 02:34:44.041
JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE

02:34:44.108 --> 02:34:44.541
DENIED.

02:34:44.608 --> 02:34:46.243
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:47.978
TO HAPPEN IN THIS SITUATION --

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:49.813
ONE OF THE PROPONENTS A MENTION

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.015
THAT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS

02:34:51.081 --> 02:34:52.683
THAT SOMEBODY'S GUNS ARE TAKEN

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:54.551
AWAY -- FOR

02:34:54.618 --> 02:34:56.286
UNIT TWENTY ONE DAYS KNOW THE

02:34:56.353 --> 02:34:57.721
WORST CASE SCENARIO IS THAT

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:59.823
SOMEBODY'S GUNS ARE TAKEN AWAY

02:34:59.890 --> 02:35:00.924
FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS AND THEY

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:02.493
NEEDED THEM.

02:35:02.559 --> 02:35:03.994
IN THEIR OWN HOMES OR THEIR OWN

02:35:04.061 --> 02:35:06.030
BUSINESSES TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

02:35:06.096 --> 02:35:07.831
AND THEY LOSE THEIR LIVES

02:35:07.898 --> 02:35:09.933
BECAUSE SOMEBODY FILED THIS

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.301
ORDER AND THERE IS NO JUSTICE.

02:35:11.368 --> 02:35:14.605
SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE.

02:35:14.672 --> 02:35:15.839
VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS IS

02:35:15.906 --> 02:35:17.408
POINTED OUT.

02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:18.942
IT ALMOST SEEMS TO WAS TO BE

02:35:19.009 --> 02:35:20.511
DISINGENUOUS THAT YOU WOULD GO

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:21.378
IN AND A BRIDGE SOMEBODY'S

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:23.814
RIGHTS.

02:35:23.881 --> 02:35:25.549
AND THEN YOU JUST TAKE GO OFF

02:35:25.616 --> 02:35:26.950
AND BE FREE.

02:35:27.017 --> 02:35:28.185
THERE'S NOTHING THAT HAPPENS

02:35:28.252 --> 02:35:29.520
NOTHING THAT'S REQUIRED TO CHECK

02:35:29.586 --> 02:35:30.888
TO SEE IF THEY REALLY ARE A

02:35:30.954 --> 02:35:31.755
DANGER.

02:35:31.822 --> 02:35:33.323
EXCEPT TWENTY ONE DAYS LATER YOU

02:35:33.390 --> 02:35:35.159
GO TO COURT AND THERE'S A

02:35:35.225 --> 02:35:36.860
CONVERSATION ABOUT IT.

02:35:36.927 --> 02:35:38.529
BUT IN THAT CASE IF THEY REALLY

02:35:38.595 --> 02:35:40.264
ARE IN DANGER THEY'RE JUST TOLD

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.031
GO OUT.

02:35:41.098 --> 02:35:44.201
AND AS WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO --

02:35:44.268 --> 02:35:46.103
YOU KNOW CAN GET GUNS THROUGH

02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:48.439
ILLEGAL MEANS TO IF THEY'RE THAT

02:35:48.505 --> 02:35:50.541
HECK BENT ON ON COMMITTING SOME

02:35:50.607 --> 02:35:51.442
SORT OF THE VIEW.

02:35:51.508 --> 02:35:52.843
THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:53.210
BILL THANK YOU.

02:35:53.277 --> 02:35:56.513

MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:02.886
PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION --

02:36:02.953 --> 02:36:04.655
I THINK WE WOULD OPPOSE THIS

02:36:04.722 --> 02:36:06.457
BILL UNLESS AS AMENDED I WOULD

02:36:06.523 --> 02:36:09.026
SECOND THE CONCERNS THAT --

02:36:09.093 --> 02:36:11.095
THIS BUCHANAN EXPRESSED ABOUT

02:36:11.161 --> 02:36:12.863
DUE PROCESS AND THE UNINTENDED

02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:16.366
CONSEQUENCES OF A SEARCH BY

02:36:16.433 --> 02:36:17.835
ARMED POLICE OFFICERS AT

02:36:17.901 --> 02:36:19.770
SOMEONE'S HOME BASED ON THE EX

02:36:19.837 --> 02:36:21.739
PARTE ORDER THANK YOU.

02:36:21.805 --> 02:36:24.374
THANK YOU.

02:36:24.441 --> 02:36:24.975
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:29.346
COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK.

02:36:29.413 --> 02:36:30.314
I'M.

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:33.050
SO I HAVE THIS AS AS I'VE TOLD

02:36:33.117 --> 02:36:34.451
YOU BEFORE SEMI MEMBER ACTING I

02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:35.119
HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT THE

02:36:35.185 --> 02:36:37.254
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE.

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:40.224
NOT QUITE THE SAME AS THE GUN

02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:42.092
OWNERS BUT WE HAVE BEEN TO BE ON

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:44.394
THE SAME RARELY ARE WE EVER HAVE

02:36:44.461 --> 02:36:46.130
SAME SIDE BUT TODAY WE ARE --

02:36:46.196 --> 02:36:48.265
I COULD ACCEPT SOMETHING THAT

02:36:48.332 --> 02:36:50.334
WAS MORE NARROW FOR EXAMPLE A

02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:52.369
TEACHER --

02:36:52.436 --> 02:36:53.003
WOULD GO TO THE PRINCIPAL AND TO

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:55.839
GET --

02:36:55.906 --> 02:36:57.074
DETERMINE THAT THE STUDENT WAS

02:36:57.141 --> 02:36:59.576
AT RISK BUT JUST TO HAVE A

02:36:59.643 --> 02:37:01.612
RANDOM CO WORKERS SAY SOMEONE IS

02:37:01.678 --> 02:37:06.316
AT RISK IS JUST. TOO HOW CAN I

02:37:06.383 --> 02:37:07.818
SAY IT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY CAN BE

02:37:07.885 --> 02:37:09.353
SETTLING THE SCORE.

02:37:09.419 --> 02:37:11.021
THEY CAN BE LYING THROUGH THEIR

02:37:11.088 --> 02:37:11.989
TEETH.

02:37:12.055 --> 02:37:14.091
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE

02:37:14.158 --> 02:37:14.992
TO ME I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

02:37:15.058 --> 02:37:16.660
DONE I COULD SUPPORT THE BILL IN

02:37:16.727 --> 02:37:18.695
A MORE NARROW WAY BUT NOT AS

02:37:18.762 --> 02:37:19.396
IT'S CURRENTLY --

02:37:19.463 --> 02:37:24.935
PRESENTED.

02:37:25.002 --> 02:37:26.270
ANY OTHER QUOTE MISTER LACKEY.

02:37:26.336 --> 02:37:27.838
YEAH JUST. TO ADD TO THIS

02:37:27.905 --> 02:37:29.006
CONVERSATION I WOULD LIKE TO

02:37:29.072 --> 02:37:30.274
JUST GIVE A STATISTIC THAT I

02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.409
FIND TO BE FAIRLY COMPELLING.

02:37:32.476 --> 02:37:34.778
ON THIS DISCUSSION THE FREQUENCY

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:35.312
TO WHICH GUN.

02:37:35.379 --> 02:37:36.680
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS WERE

02:37:36.747 --> 02:37:39.516
ISSUED FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN

02:37:39.583 --> 02:37:40.617
TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN

02:37:40.684 --> 02:37:44.087
REQUESTED BY FAMILY MEMBERS WAS.

02:37:44.154 --> 02:37:44.621
EIGHTEEN REQUESTED BY LAW

02:37:44.688 --> 02:37:47.591
ENFORCEMENT WAS.

02:37:47.658 --> 02:37:48.192
FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX SO WE

02:37:48.258 --> 02:37:49.393
COULD SEE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:51.128
IS VERY VERY ACTIVE.

02:37:51.195 --> 02:37:54.665
AND I THINK THAT --

02:37:54.731 --> 02:37:56.300
IN ALL HONESTY THIS A SOLUTION

02:37:56.366 --> 02:37:57.935
IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AND THE

02:37:58.001 --> 02:37:59.636
ARE DUE PROCESS CONCERNS ARE

02:37:59.703 --> 02:38:00.737
VERY VERY.

02:38:00.804 --> 02:38:03.707
POWERFUL MY OPINION SO I I WILL

02:38:03.774 --> 02:38:04.274
NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

02:38:04.341 --> 02:38:04.541
THANK YOU.

02:38:04.608 --> 02:38:07.544
THANK YOU.

02:38:07.611 --> 02:38:09.913
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:12.082
YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU I DID

02:38:12.149 --> 02:38:13.817
JUST TO CLARIFY THE STATS --

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:16.119
MY AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM --

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:17.621
LANCASTER'S CORRECT THERE'S

02:38:17.688 --> 02:38:19.189
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THAT HAVE BEEN

02:38:19.256 --> 02:38:20.591
ISSUED OVER THE THREE YEARS.

02:38:20.657 --> 02:38:21.859
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE MILLIONS

02:38:21.925 --> 02:38:24.094
OF GUN OWNERS IN FROM A SMALL

02:38:24.161 --> 02:38:26.096
NUMBER.

02:38:26.163 --> 02:38:27.764
WHILE CERTAIN LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:38:27.831 --> 02:38:28.966
AGENCIES HAVE BEEN ACTIVE PRIME

02:38:29.032 --> 02:38:31.335
MANY OF THOSE LARGE MAJORITY OF

02:38:31.401 --> 02:38:33.503
THOSE HAVE COME FROM SAN DIEGO.

02:38:33.570 --> 02:38:34.137
BECAUSE OF THE CITY ATTORNEY'S

02:38:34.204 --> 02:38:34.805
LEADERSHIP.

02:38:34.872 --> 02:38:37.307
I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

02:38:37.374 --> 02:38:38.175
FOR THE TO COUNTY THAT I

02:38:38.242 --> 02:38:39.843
REPRESENT SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN

02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:40.911
MATTEO.

02:38:40.978 --> 02:38:42.713
THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE ISSUED IN

02:38:42.779 --> 02:38:44.281
THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD.

02:38:44.348 --> 02:38:46.850
SO AGAIN FOR WHATEVER REASON THE

02:38:46.917 --> 02:38:48.952
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN MY

02:38:49.019 --> 02:38:50.187
TO COUNTIES.

02:38:50.254 --> 02:38:51.555
HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THIS AS OUR

02:38:51.622 --> 02:38:53.590
PRIORITY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:54.258
GIVEN THE WE HAVE PERSONALLY MET

02:38:54.324 --> 02:38:55.959
WITH -- WHAT

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:57.895
WITH WITH ONE OF THE AGENCIES IN

02:38:57.961 --> 02:39:00.297
OUR IN OUR JURISDICTION AGAIN IT

02:39:00.364 --> 02:39:02.633
JUST ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

02:39:02.699 --> 02:39:04.701
LIVING IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS TO

02:39:04.768 --> 02:39:07.537
HAVE ANOTHER RECOURSE?

02:39:07.604 --> 02:39:10.040
ON SIX HUNDRED IN THREE YEARS IS

02:39:10.107 --> 02:39:11.341
NOT A VERY LARGE NUMBER I THINK

02:39:11.408 --> 02:39:12.576
WHEN WHEN I FIRST PRESENTED THIS

02:39:12.643 --> 02:39:14.611
BILL IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:14.945
CONCERN IS --

02:39:15.012 --> 02:39:16.246
THIS IS GOING TO BE YOU KNOW

02:39:16.313 --> 02:39:17.281
THERE'S GONNA BE A LINE BY THE

02:39:17.347 --> 02:39:18.282
COURT ROOM AND THEY'LL BE

02:39:18.348 --> 02:39:19.283
HANDING THEM OUT BY THE

02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:20.884
THOUSANDS OF THE MILLIONS AND

02:39:20.951 --> 02:39:21.485
REALLY.

02:39:21.551 --> 02:39:22.653
THAT HAS NOT REALLY HAPPENED I

02:39:22.719 --> 02:39:24.221
THINK EVEN WITH THIS --

02:39:24.288 --> 02:39:25.422
EXPANSION.

02:39:25.489 --> 02:39:27.658
THIS EXPANSION WILL ONLY.

02:39:27.724 --> 02:39:29.426
MY IN MY OPINION SLIGHTLY

02:39:29.493 --> 02:39:30.794
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF GUN

02:39:30.861 --> 02:39:32.195
VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS BUT

02:39:32.262 --> 02:39:34.364
WHAT IT DOES IT GIVES PEOPLE A

02:39:34.431 --> 02:39:35.999
REASONABLE OPTION WHO CAN WHO

02:39:36.066 --> 02:39:37.467
ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR

02:39:37.534 --> 02:39:38.735
SITUATIONS.

02:39:38.802 --> 02:39:42.205
UNFORTUNATELY WITH MANY OF THE

02:39:42.272 --> 02:39:44.274
ALWAYS HERE OR WHAT THE

02:39:44.341 --> 02:39:46.009
SITUATION WAS AFTER THE FACT

02:39:46.076 --> 02:39:47.344
WHEN I INTRODUCED THIS LAST YEAR

02:39:47.411 --> 02:39:48.612
WE HEARD ABOUT THE PARKING

02:39:48.679 --> 02:39:50.981
SITUATION WITH THE FBI WAS.

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:52.282
WATCHING THIS INDIVIDUAL THE

02:39:52.349 --> 02:39:53.951
PRINCIPLES WATCHING THIS

02:39:54.017 --> 02:39:54.685
INDIVIDUAL THE TEACHERS WERE

02:39:54.751 --> 02:39:55.886
WATCHING THIS INDIVIDUAL

02:39:55.953 --> 02:39:57.621
UNFORTUNATELY NONE OF THOSE

02:39:57.688 --> 02:39:59.589
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO

02:39:59.656 --> 02:40:01.692
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

02:40:01.758 --> 02:40:04.161
UNDER FLORIDA LAW.

02:40:04.227 --> 02:40:05.228
UNDER OUR LOG FIFTY AYE FISHEL

02:40:05.295 --> 02:40:08.198
COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT --

02:40:08.265 --> 02:40:09.933
WE SIGNED INTO A AGAIN YOU HAD.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:11.301
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

02:40:11.368 --> 02:40:13.036
INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:40:13.103 --> 02:40:14.671
INTERACT WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL

02:40:14.738 --> 02:40:17.674
AND NOTHING WAS DONE.

02:40:17.741 --> 02:40:20.143
SO AGAIN AND ALLOWS PEOPLE.

02:40:20.210 --> 02:40:22.112
RECOURSE ALLOWS PEOPLE TO TAKE.

02:40:22.179 --> 02:40:23.447
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ACTION IN

02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:25.282
THEIR OWN HANDS WHICH I BELIEVE

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:26.483
IS HIS THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:27.851
LABOR ONE HAS A RIGHT TO GO TO

02:40:27.918 --> 02:40:29.152
WORK AND NOT GET KILLED.
