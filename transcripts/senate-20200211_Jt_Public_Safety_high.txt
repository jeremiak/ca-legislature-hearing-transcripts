TRYING TO RESOLVE THAT TO SEE IF THERE'S REPLACEMENT WITNESS BUT WE WILL BEGIN. VERY SOON. YES PLEASE PLEASE PUT IT TO. GOOD MORNING APOLOGIES FOR A DELAY WE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. WELL FIRST WE ARE NOW BEGINNING THE JOINT SENATE AND ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON PUBLIC SAFETY HEARING ON A PROPOSED INITIATIVE- WHICH ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE WEBSITE IS REFERRED TO AS INITIATIVE NUMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT'S THE PROPOSITION. THREE TWO CALL IN THIS CASE. NO NO OKAY GOOD ALL RIGHT SO ANYWAY THE ARMS PURPOSE OF OUR GATHERING IS FOR THIS JOINT COMMITTEE TO HAVE THAT HEARING- THE REASON THAT WE WERE TAKING SOME TIME BEFORE I GAVEL DOWN WAS BECAUSE THE MAIN WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSITION- FROM FROM HIM SHE KNIGHTED CALLED US AND INSULAR IN IL TOOK A CHANCE WE WANTED TO DO OUR BEST TO TRY TO FIND SOMEONE TO REPRESENT. IF WE'VE NOT YET BEEN SICK BUT WE AT LEAST WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR LEDGE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND SOME OTHERS AND PERHAPS BEFORE WE ARE ADJOURNED WE WILL HAVE SOMEONE WHO COMES AND REPRESENTS THE INITIATIVE- LET ME STOP THERE AND ALLOW ME TO TURN. TO MY- FELLOW CHAIR AND THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGGIE SEVEN STORE JONES SAWYER IN BY YOU JONES SAWYER YES. GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER FOR INVITING ASSEMBLY PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE- TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO LISTEN TO THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT PROPOSES TO MAKE CHANGES TO PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND FIFTY SEVEN. TO THE- ROOM JUSTICE RELY. STILL CALIFORNIA MUST CONTINUE WORK TO DO WE DO TO PRE POPULATION REALLY IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL MANDATE THAT DEEMED ARE OVERCROWDED SYSTEM ON CONSTITUTIONAL. WITHOUT REDUCTIONS TO IN MAY POPULATION SPENDING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY AND CALIFORNIA WOULD ULTIMATELY BE REQUIRED TO BUILD NEW PRISONS OR CONTRACT FOR MORE PRISON BEDS. THESE ARE STEP THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEES. AND THIS LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE HAVE TRIED TO INVOKE AVOID IN FACT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT REHABILITATION AS THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO REDUCING PRISON POPULATION AS WITH OTHER INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS WE WILL NOT BE TAKING A BOAT ON ANYTHING TODAY. THIS HEARING WILL BEGIN WITH A REPORT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND THEY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY STATEMENTS FROM SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN HIS BALLOT MEASURE. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND. THE TO REPRESENTATION THE LA L. ARE NEUTRAL. SAY THAT AGAIN THEY ARE NEUTRAL AND THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME TO POLICY QUESTIONS QUESTIONS OF THAT NATURE BEST RESERVED FOR THE OTHER PANELISTS. AT THE END OF THE HEARING THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME OF I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHO MIGHT LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS TO DO SO. SENATOR JACKSON THANK YOU YEAH. IT WAS MY HOPE AND I HOPE WE CAN HEAR REASONS- WIDE. THESE INITIATIVES SHOULD BE SUPPORTED. GIVEN WHAT I BELIEVE THE STATISTICS ARE IN HOW WE'RE SEEING CRIME AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL. IN DECADES AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE SOME OF THE FOCUS HERE- WHAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE ESSENTIALLY. I'M DOING WEAKENING OF THOSE PUBLICLY APPROVED PROVISIONS UNDER FORTY SEVEN AND FIFTY SEVEN AND THEN THE OTHER INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE HAD TO TRY TO REFOCUS OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MORE IN PREVENTION AND REHABILITATION SO- I THINK THAT FOR MANY OF US WHO WILL BE VOTING ON THIS INITIATIVE THAT IS REALLY A CRITICAL QUESTION I HOPE THAT THAT CAN BE. DISCUSSED TODAY THANK YOU YOU'RE WELCOME SO JUST AS A CLARIFICATION THIS IT'S A SINGLE INITIATIVE AND WE'RE HAVING THE HEARING ON THE SINGLE INITIATIVE AND AS I INDICATED BEFORE BECAUSE IT IS SCHEDULED TO BE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT WE DO NOT HAVE A PROPOSITION NUMBER YET BUT ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE IT IS REFERRED TO AS A INITIATIVE NUMBER EIGHTEEN FORTY SOON AS MY COLLEAGUES HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER- INDICATED AT THE END OF THE FORMAL PRESENTATIONS WE WIL HAVE- PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE MIKE OVER THERE SO WE'LL START NOW WITH- THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE BOTH CAITLYN O'NEILL UNTRUE SIR BURKE 52% ON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- ANALYSIS OF THE INITIATIVE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING TODAY FROM A HANDOUT WHICH IS BEING PASSED OUT. TO YOU ALL STATE LAW REQUIRES OUR OFFICE TO PREPARE IMPARTIAL ANALYSES OF ALL MEASURES THAT QUALIFY FOR THE STATEWIDE BALLOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE WE ARE CURRENTLY PREPARING OUR MATERIALS FOR THIS MEASURE. TODAY I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEASURE AND DISCUSS THE MAJOR FISCAL FAX. TURNING TO PAGE ONE THE MEASURE ED MAKES VARIOUS CHANGES TO STATE LAW- THAT CAN GENERALLY BE GROUPED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES WHICH ARE ONE INCREASING FOR CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN THEFT RELATED CRIMES TO CHANGING HOW OFFENDERS ARE SUPERVISED IN THE COMMUNITY AND THREE THREE CHANGING THE PROCESS CREATED BY PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. FOR CONSIDERING THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN OFFENDERS FROM PRISON. AND FOR REQUIRING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COLLECT DNA SAMPLES FROM ADULTS CONVICTED OF CERTAIN OFFENSES. OVER THE NEXT- FEW PAGES OF THIS HANDOUT I'M GONNA PROVIDE FIRST SOME BACKGROUND AND THEN DISCUSS THE CHECK CHANGES AT THE WOOD THE MEASURE WOULD MAKE ON EACH OF THOSE FOUR CATEGORIES AND THEN I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE THE MAJOR FISCAL FACTS OF THE MEASURE. ON PAGE TWO I'M GOING TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CRIMINAL SENTENCING OFFENDERS CONVICTED OF FELONIES CAN BE SPARSE GEN CAN BE SENTENCED A STATE PRISON IF THEY HAVE. CURRENT OR PRIOR CONVICTIONS FOR SERIOUS VIOLENT OR SEX OFFENSES. WHERE IS FELONY OFFENDERS WITH OUT THOSE KERNER PRIOR CONVICTIONS ARE GENERALLY- SENTENCED OR TYPICALLY SENTENCED TO COUNTY JAIL OR THE SUPERVISION OF A COUNTY PROBATION OFFICER OR SOME COMBINATION OF THE TWO. AND THEN DEPENDING ON THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE AND THE CRIME COMMITTED OFFENDERS WITH CURRENT US AT OR PRIOR SEARS VIOLIN OR SEX OFFENSES CAN BE KEPT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND THEN OFFENDERS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANORS I HAVE MAY BE SENTENCED TO JAIL. COUNTY COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR IF I RECEIVE A FINE OR SOME COMBINATION OF THOSE. AND MISDEMEANOR OFFENDERS GENERALLY RECEIVE A LESSER AMOUNTS OF TIME IN JAIL AND UNDER SUPERVISION RELATIVE TO FELONY OFFENDERS. I AND FINALLY SOME CRIMES CAN BE CHARGES EITHER A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR AND THOSE CRIMES ARE REFERRED TO AS WYLER'S. TURNING TO PAGE THREE THE MEASURE WOULD INCREASE PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN THE LATED CRIMES BY CREATING TWO NEW WIDLAR CRIMES MEANING THAT THEY WOULD BE PUNISHABLE AS A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR AND IF PUNISHABLE AS A FELONY BY UP TO THREE YEARS IN JAIL INCLUDING IN CASES WHERE THE PERSON HAS A PRIOR- CURRENT OR PRIOR SERIES OF. VIOLENT OR SEX OFFENSE. THE FIRST OF THOSE CRIMES WOULD BE CALLED SERIAL SAFT. WOULD APPLY TO ANY PERSON MATURE MORE PAST CONVICTIONS FOR CERTAIN DEATH RELATED CRIMES. WHO IS FOUND GUILTY OF SHOPLIFTING OR PETY THEFT INVOLVING PROPERTY WORTH MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THE SECOND OF THOSE CRIMES IS CALLED ORGANIZE RETAIL THEFT IT WOULD APPLY TO ANY PERSON ACTING WITH OTHERS. THE COMMITTEE NEEDS AFTER SHOPLIFTING TOUR MORE TIMES. WHERE THE TOTAL VALUE OF PROPERTY STOLEN EXCEEDS APPLE WITHIN A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS EXCEEDS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. AND THEN I'D NOTE THAT THERE IS A SIMILAR CRIME A CURRENTLY IN STATE LAW- THE TIME PERIOD FOR AGGREGATING THE- THE CRIMES IS- IS TWELVE MONTHS BUT THE DOLLAR OF VALUE. THRESHOLD IS HIGHER IT'S NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND THAT CRIME IS WILL SUNSET UNDER EXISTING LAW A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE MEASURE WOULD GO INTO EFFECT IF IT'S APPROVED. THE MEASURE ALSO ALLOWS SOME EXIST SOME EXISTING THEFT RELATED OFFENSES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE PUNISHED- AS FELONIES INSTEAD OF MISDEMEANORS. TURNING TO PAGE FOR. A OFFENDERS WHO WERE RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER SERVING A SENTENCE FOR A SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONY ARE SUPERVISED AT A IN THE COMMUNITY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BY STATE PAROLE AGENTS WORDS OFFENDERS RELEASED FROM PRISON FOR. NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT OFFENSES ARE GENERALLY SUPERVISED BY COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS ON WHAT'S CALLED POST RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR APPEAR CS FOR SHORT. AND WHEN THOSE OFFENDERS BREAK THE RULES THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW AS- WHILE THEY'RE UNDER SUPERVISION REFERRED TO AS THE TERMS OF THEIR SUPERVISION. A PAROLE AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS CAN REQUEST A JUDGE TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF AN OFFENDER'S SUPERVISION WHICH CAN RESULT IN HARSHER TERMS OR AT THAT PERIOD IN JAIL. THE MEASURE WOULD MAKE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT AFFECT HOW PAROLE AND PROBATION DEPARTMENT SUPERVISE OFFENDERS INCLUDING REQUIRING THAT AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO PETITION A JUDGE TO CHANGE THE TERMS OF A P. R. C. S. OFFENDERS. SUPERVISION IF- THEY VIOLATE THEIR TERMS FOR A THIRD TIME. AND REQUIRING STATE PAROLE IN COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TO EXCHANGE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FENDERS THEY SUPERVISE. MOVING ON TO SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN RELEASE CONSIDERATION PROCESS. THAT MEASURE AMENDED THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO SPECIFY THAT PRISON INMATES CONVICTED OF NONVIOLENT CRIMES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR RELEASE CONSIDERATION AFTER COMPLETING THE DEAD TERM FOR THEIR PRIMARY OFFENSE. CDC ARE THEN ADOPTED REGULATIONS THAT. LIMIT THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT PROCESS- NOTABLY- TO. DOES NOT CONVICTED OF IT- NOT SERVING A TERM FOR A VIOLENT FELONY- AS WELL AS THOSE NOT REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER. BPH STAFF OR BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS STAFF REVIEW OF INFORMATION ABOUT HELD ELIGIBLE INMATE SUCH AS THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORY TO DETERMINE IF THEY DO NOT POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND ARE SUITABLE FOR RELEASE. THIS MEASURE WOULD MAKE VARIOUS CHANGES TO THAT PROCESS- INCLUDING EXCLUDING IT CERTAIN INMATES WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE ELIGIBLE. FOR EXAMPLE I THOSE WHO ARE SENTENCED TO LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE- UNDER THE MEASURE THAT WOULD- TYPICALLY APPLIED TO A NON VIOLENT THIRD STRIKERS THE MEASURE WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS TO DENY RELEASE TO INMATES WHO POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF CREATING VICTIMS AS A RESULT OF FUTURE FELONY ACTIVITY RATHER THAN. THOSE WHO POSE AN UNREASONABLE RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY SO THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE RELEASE STANDARD- AND THEN IT IT WOULD REQUIRE CITIES ARE TO MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO LOCATE VICTIMS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE REGISTERED WITH THE STATE. AND THEN I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS MEASURES SEEK TO PUT LIMITS ON CD SERWIS CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY- WITHOUT CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION- SO IF CHALLENGE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT A JUDGE COULD RULE THAT THOSE PROVISIONS AS RELATE TO WHAT CONSTITUTES WHAT SEAT AT PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN PUT IN THE CONSTITUTION- AND WHAT THE MEASURE SEEKS TO CHANGE- MISSED MIGHT NOT GOING TO AFFECT. AND THEN MOVING ON TO PAGE SIX JUST SOME BRIEF BACKGROUND ON DNA COLLECTION. UNDER CURRENT LAW ANY ADULT ARRESTED. OR CHARGED WITH A FELONY ANY JUVENILE SOUND OF COMMITTED A FELONY OR AN INDIVIDUAL REQUIRED TO REGISTER AS A SEX OFFENDER ARSONIST IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A DNA SAMPLE FOR LAWN FIRST FORSMAN PURPOSES. THOSE SAMPLES ARE COLLECTED BY STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROCESSED- GENERALLY IN. BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND LOCAL FORENSIC LABORATORIES. THE MEASURE WOULD EXPANDED THAT SET OF OFFENDERS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE REQUIRED TO COLLECT SAMPLES FROM. A SPECIFICALLY AT WOULD EXPAND IT TO ADULTS CONVICTED OF CERTAIN MISDEMEANORS INCLUDING- SHOPLIFTING FORGING CHECKS AND CERTAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OFFENSES. AND FINALLY ON PAGE SEVEN OF THIS GUIDE THE MAJOR FISCAL FACTS OF THE MEASURE. IT WOULD INCREASE STATE AND LOCAL CORRECTIONS COSTS PRIMARILY IN THREE WAYS. FIRST IT WOULD INCREASE THE COUNTY JAIL POPULATIONS. AND THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION FOR CERTAIN OFFENDERS. SECOND WOULD LIKELY- REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INMATES WERE RELEASED UNDER THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN RELEASE CONSIDERATION PROCESS AND THREE IT WHICH- BY CHANGING COMMUNITY SUPERVISION PRACTICES THAT COULD ALSO INCREASE COUNTY JAIL POPULATIONS. AND THEN WE KNOW THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE INCREASE COSTS WILL- WOULD LIKELY BE OFFSET BY SOME REDUCE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS HAVING FEWER OFFENDERS TO CONSIDER FOR RELEASED BECAUSE OF THE- TIGHTER EXCLUSIONARY CRITERIA THEY WOULD HAVE. SOME REDUCE WORKLOAD. WE ALSO KNOW THE MEASURE COULD INCREASE STATE AND LOCAL COURT RELATED COSTS BY. SHIFTING INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FELONIES REDUCING THE NUMBER OF MISDEMEANORS. AND MISDEMEANORS ARE EIGHTEEN FELONIES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE FOR COURT A HIGH COURT OPERATIONS AND THEN- IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE COURT PROCEEDINGS BY REQUIRING PROBATION DEPARTMENT MEANT STEPS- PETITION A COURT TO CHANGE OFENDERS. CS OFFENDERS TERMS WHEN THEY VIOLATE FOR A THIRD TIME. AND FINALLY THE MEASURE WOULD INCREASE STATE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COSTS. ASSOCIATED WITH COLLECTING AND PROCESSING THE ADDITIONAL DNA SAMPLES. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. MR SODERBERGH DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BEFOREWE- ASKED FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE DICE. RESERVE OR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M JUST HERE TO ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS NECESSARY THANK YOU TO APPRECIATE IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I MEAN I JUST STARTED OFF ON YOUR OWN ON A MAJOR FISCAL EFFECTS INSISTED ON BUDGET. ARM SUB FIVE DO YOU HAVE ANY BALLPARK NUMBERS OF WHAT THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO INCREASE COSTS. BUT IT IS ONLY LIKE TWO DOLLARS STEP WOULD MEAN ANYTHING. FIVE IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE SIGNIFICANT DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND OF BALLPARK LOOKING AT. POTENTIALLY LOOK AT. SO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN WE PREPARED- OUR LETTER ON THIS MEASURE BEFORE IT WENT OUT FOR SIGNATURE COLLECTION WE DID PREPARE FISCAL ESTIMATE WHICH I CAN SHARE WITH YOU. ALTHOUGH I WOULD NOTE THAT- IT'S BEEN. A COUPLE YEARS NOW SO THINGS HAVE CHANGED. A BIG BIG ITEM POTENTIALLY IS THAT- WHEN WE PREPARED THE LETTER THE- THE CDC ARE REGULATIONS ON- PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN RELEASE CONSIDERATION ELIGIBILITY EXCLUDED- INDEED L. LIFERS AND NOW BECAUSE OF A COURT CASE THEY- INCLUDE LIFERS SO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK THROUGH ALL THAT AND DO IN YOU KNOW REVISIT EVERYTHING BUT- AT THE TIME TO ME IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE ESTIMATED THAT- THE STATE AND LOCAL CORRECTIONS COSTS. COULD THERE COULD BE A NET INCREASE IN STATE LOCAL CORRECTIONS COSTS RANGING POTENTIALLY IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEASURE- AND THEN WE ESTIMATED THAT THE INCREASE IN COURT RELATED COSTS COULD BE AROUND A FEW MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COSTS WOULD LIKELY NOT EXCEED A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. OKAY AD THEN. ON THE ON THE PROPOSED DURING PROPOSALS- DEBT HAVE INCREASED PENALTIES FOR LOCAL. FOR LOCAL THIRTY VIEW AN OBVIOUSLY THE ORGANIZED RETAIL DEATH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE- SINCE I WROTE IT- DO YOU HAVE YOU HAD ANY. DISCUSSION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHERS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EVEN THE SERIAL THAT FOR ANY OF THESE. SPECIFICALLY HOW THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR IS IT BOILS THINGS WE NEED TO GET MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE TO UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE THESE LAWS CAN HELP. WITH SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING ATTRIBUTED IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW OR DO WE- KNOW ORGANIZED RETAIL THAT JUST MAY BE TOO BORING MAYBE CALL IT J. SORT JONES SAWYER ORGANIZED RETAIL STEPPED IN. TWO LITTLE PUNCTURE SOMETHING. AT SO WHAT AT THE TIME WE PREPARED OUR OUR LETTER. WE THE ORGANIZE RETAIL THEFT YOU'RE REFERRING TO THAT'S CURRENTLY PART OF STATE LAW- WITH DID NOT EXIST YET SO WE HADN'T HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE WILL BE AS WE- WORK THIS SPRING ON PREPARING OUR BALLOT MATERIALS WE WILL BE HAVING THOSE TYPES OF CONCERT CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU. CENTER MORE LOCKED Q. MADAM CHAIR IS THERE A CORRELATION WITH AB ONE OH NINE AND PROP FIFTY SEVEN BECAUSE WHEN WE STARTED THE MEETING THE CHAIR REGINALD JONES SAWYER MENTION HAVING TO REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION WHICH WAS. SORT OF DONE BY AB ONE OH NINE. BOTH THROUGH A REALIGNMENT AND PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN HAVE REDUCE THE PRISON POPULATION. DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I JUST WANNA GO TO THAT- I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN TWENTY TWELVE FOR THE COUNTY OF ORANGE AND- THE- YEAH I WAS VISITED BY CELEBRITIES- LIKE REGINALD JONES SAWYER. BUT I WAS INVITED TO GO TO LOS ANGELES I THINK IT WAS THE CALIFORNIA CLUB. BY GOVERNOR'S. DAVIS WILSON AND TOOK MEIJIN AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW HOUSE AB ONE OH NINE WORKING IN OUR COUNTIES AND THEY INVITED THE CHAIRS OF ALL THE COUNTIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SEVEN YEARS OFFICE HE WAS THERE- AND BRAD METS AND FELT CHAIR OF THE SAN MARINO COUNTY. FORTY SUPERVISOR SAID THAT. SINCE AB ONE OH NINE WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE LOOKING FOR THE WORD- PROPERTY CRIMES PROPERTY COMES WITH A 30% AND BILL HORN FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY STARTED NAMING THE WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN MURDERED. BY THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN HIS DISTRICT AND SO WE ALL HAD STORIES OF HOW. ONE OH NINE WAS IMPACTING A SO I DON'T SEE IN YOUR REPORT WHICH GOT IT THIS MORNING BUT I DON'T SEE LIKE AN ANALYSIS OF. CRIME RATES WE HEARD THAT IT'S GOING DOWN- BUT IN YOUR REPORT DID YOU. DO ANY ANALYSIS OF WHAT AT A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN AB ONE ON NINE PROP WAS THERE A CHANGE BECAUSE I'M GETTING. TARGET COMING INTO MY OFFICE AND THEY'RE SAYING HEY LOOK- THE SHOPLIFTING IS JUST REALLY INCREASED. BUT I GET THE SENSE THAT POLICE OFFICERS AREN'T EVEN. CHARGING ANY YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CAN GO UP TO NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. THEY THEY THEY CITE THEM THEY'RE THEY'RE BACK THAT AFTERNOON I'M GETTING ALL THESE ANECDOTAL STORIES I'D- LOVE TO SEE. WHAT THE DATA IS SHOWING BUT YOU WON'T HAVE DAD IF PEOPLE HAVE GIVEN UP IF PUBLIC SAFETY IS. KIND OF THROWN THEIR HANDS UP. THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA HAS LOOKED AT THAT QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO REALIGNMENT AND PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN. AND THEY FOUND THAT IN THE CASE OF REALIGNMENT- AT CERTAIN PROPERTY CRIMES SPECIFICALLY AUTO THEFT DID INCREASE SOMEWHAT- OR AT LEAST WORK THEY WERE ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THAT STATISTICALLY TO. REALIGNMENT THEY DIDN'T FIND AN INCREASE IN VIOLENT CRIMES AND THEN- REGARDING PROP FORTY SEVEN THEY FOUND A- INCREASE AT. A SMALL INCREASE IN LARCENY. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY RESEARCHERS HAVING YET LOOKED AT PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN IN THAT WAY- IT MAY BE THAT IT'S TOO EARLY. OKAY I'M I'M ARGUE EVEN SEEING. NEWS REPORTS ABOUT CITY SAN FRANCISCO HAVING CARS WINDOWS BROKEN AT A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL HIGHER RATE I MEAN IT'S MAKING IT TO. OUR OUR NEWS STATIONS DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS A IS THERE ANYONE THAT BESIDES PP I SEE THAT'S KIND OF DONE A DEEPER DIVE IN SOME OF THE STATISTICS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CRIMES. I AM AWARE OF A STUDY AT BEING A UC IRVINE ON PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN DAYS THEY FOUND- VERY SIMILAR. RESULTS TWO PP I SEE. I'M NOT AWARE OF OTHER STUDIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SISTER. AS CHAIR. SENATOR JACKSON GO AHEAD VERY BRIEFLY I THINK WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS TO FIND OUT WHAT THE TRENDS ARE. ARE WE SEEING REDUCTION IN CRIME. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS OR THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT THE CRIMES GOING RAMP AND SO FORTH BUT THE DATA SEEMS TO SHOW TO THE CONTRARY AND I THINK. PART OF THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS INITIATIVE IS THE BELIEF THAT CRIME IS GOING UP AND SO I THINK WHAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT IN TRYING TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OR THE ACCURACY OF REASON THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS. IS WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE SEEING CRIME GOING UP OR CRIME IS GOING DOWN. AND I THINK THAT IS SORT OF THE SINGULAR ISSUE HERE ARE AT IS AGAIN OR THE INITIATIVE SO WE PASSED TO REFORM THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE THEY WORKING OR NOT. AND IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET A AN HONEST STRAIGHTFORWARD. IN FACT BASED DETERMINATION OF THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON OR COULD YOU CITE US WHAT STUDIES YOU'VE LOOKED AT THAT WAS MENTIONED THE PP I SEE- AND THE SECOND ONE THAT JUSTICE INVADED ME. BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE FIND OUT JUST WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WORLD TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT AN INITIATIVE LIKE THIS IS HELPFUL OR HARMFUL. HAVE THIS THE SECOND CITY WAS UC IRVINE. AND AT. CRIME IS AT A HISTORICAL LOW OVERALL- WE HAVE SEENIN RECENT YEARS SORT OF A SMALL IT TAKES ARE DOWN TAKES IN DIFFERENT WHETHER TALKING ABOUT- PROPERTY CRIME A VIOLENT CRIME THE ANSWER CAN BE DIFFERENT- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE DONE TO DO IT AS IN DEPTH STATISTICAL CAUSAL ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THESE INITIATIVES ON CRIME RATES. YOU SEE HAS BEEN PLAYING THAT ROLE- THING. I ACTUALLY HAVE THE PP I SEE REPORT BEFORE ME- IN YOU MAY CONTINUE MR SERVER BUT JUST TO CLARIFY I'M LOOKING AT THE REPORT GOT THE GRAPH RIGHT HERE. BOTH PROPERTY CRIME RATES AND VIOLENT CRIME RATES ARE LOWER THEY'RE NOT HIGHER AND IN FACT THE PRICE THEY ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS IN THIS IS RIGHT IN THE PP I SEIZE REPORT. YEAH WELL NOT ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT BUT THE MAYBE THERE'S NEW DATA BUT WE'VE NOT SEEN IT AND NEITHER REALLY- NOR PP I SEE IS PRESENTED IT. BUT I WILL ALLOW YOU TO FINISH AND THEN I'LL GO TO. MY QUESTIONS GO AHEAD. YEAH THE ONLY THING I WAS GOING TO- PROVIDE SOME CLARIFICATION AND IS THE P. P. I. C. STUDIES THAT DID FIND. SOME POTENTIAL INCREASE IN PROPERTY CRIMES ESSENTIALLY THE METHODOLOGY THIS STUDY WAS. TO TRY TO CREATE A SYNTHETIC CONTROL GROUP SO WHAT THEY DID IS THEY LOOKED AT CRIME RATES IN OTHER STATES AND SORT OF. TURN THEM INTO A- A PACKAGE. THAT HAD FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA CRIME RATES CONSISTENTLY- IN PAST YEARS. AND BY TAKING THIS APPROACH THEY WERE ABLE TO- MAKE A STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA HAD. PROP FORTY SEVEN AND REALIGNMENT NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED. AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT- IN THE CASE OF BOTH PROP FORTY SEVEN AND REALIGNMENT- IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THEY REALLY CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO- MAJOR INCREASES IN CRIME AT ALL- THAT MOST CRIME RATES WERE UNAFFECTED BY THE MEASURES HOWEVER IN THE CASE OF PROP FORTY SEVEN. THEY DID THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IT CONTRIBUTED TO SOMEWHAT OF AN INCREASE AND LARCENY THEFT CRIMES AND IN THE CASE OF AB ONE OH NINE. THEY THOUGHT IT POSSIBLY INCREASED I COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN AUTO WITH US. OVERALL THEY DIDN'T HAVE SIGNIFICAN IMPACTS ON ON THE RATE OF CRIME. THANK YOU. FOR YES IT INDEED. IN THE REPORT THAT THE- PROP FORTY SEVEN. MAY HAVE AFFECTED THOSE STEPS THAT YOU ROOF WE REFER. TO IT DOES NOT SHOW BUT IT DOES NOT SHOW THAT INCREASE IN TERMS OF THE YEAR TO YEAR SO CLEARLY WE'RE STILL GONNA NEED DATA WE'RE GONNA NEED DATA FOR NINETEEN- AND I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IMPORTANT TO GET THAT DATA BECAUSE- INDEPENDENT OF THE INITIATIVE. WE HAVE THE LAW THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. AUTHORED IN THAT IS IN EFFECT WHICH THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT'S REGARDING THE- ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO KNOW BUT I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE DATA YET IS WHETHER THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE. IN WELL MAYBE NOT AN INCREASE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T EXIST BUT WHAT IS THE LEVEL OF A REST THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED NOW THAT THAT LAWS IN EFFECT WHAT'S THE LEVEL OF CONVICTIONS- IS. IT AGAIN WITH SUCH DATA MIGHT INDICATE TO US EITHER THAT- MINIS ARE TRICKY BECAUSE- IS LAW ENFORCEMENT UTILIZING THE TOOL THAT WAS PROVIDED- HAS IT BEEN EFFECTIVE- BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND IT IT HAS TO SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT- THE LEGISLATURE. COULD IT CHOOSE TO- EXTENDED- BUT IT'S ALSO AS WAS REFERENCED BY OUR ILIO ELEMENTS OF IT ARE BUILT INTO THIS INITIATIVE. AND IF IT'S- I MEAN PART OF WHAT WE'D WANT TO KNOW IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT- LEGITIMATE TO CONTINUE IT OR NOT BUT WE NEED THE DATA BEFORE WE CAN. IN REALLY GET THAT NIGHT OUT YOU HAVE IT. NO I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME BUT- WHEN WE WORK ON OUR BALLOT MATERIALS WE TYPICALLY DO REQUEST ARRESTING CONVICTION DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THAT IS LIKELY A CRIME THAT WE WILL REQUEST. A DATE ON TO INFORM THE ANALYSIS THAT WE PREPARE THIS SPRING GOOD I LOOK FORWARD TO IT NOW YOU RAISED THE POINT THAT. WHAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN DOES AND THIS INITIATIVE DOES ON DO A NUMBER OF. ASPECTS OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE WHAT IT DOES IS IT CHANGES SOME- OFFENSES THAT WERE FELONIES TWO MISDEMEANORS BUT IT PRIMARILY IT GIVES- INCARCERATED PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO GET CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED. FOR CERTAIN REHABILITATIVE BEHAVIORS BUT WHAT I WANT TO CLEAR FIND YOU STATED THIS BUT I WANTED TO RE EMPHASIZE IT AND HAVE YOU ADDRESS THIS IS THAT WHILE IT'S CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED IT'S REALLY JUST THE ABILITY TO GO BEFORE THE PRO BOARD EARLIER. IT DOES NOT MANDATE THE PAROLE BOARD TO RELEASE SOMEONE SO WHAT I AM INTERESTED IN AND I JUST WANNA BE REALLY CLEAR THERE'S A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDING THAT SOMEHOW PROP FIFTY SEVEN GUARANTEES PEOPLE'S RELEASED EARLIER NO IT DOES NOT. IT PURELY ALLOWS YOU TO GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD EARLIER IF YOU HAVE DONE THESE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS PROPERLY- BUT SO WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN HAS THERE BEEN ANY INCREASE IN DECISIONS BY THE PAROLE BOARD REGARDING RELEASE BECAUSE THE DATA I HAVE SEEN IS THAT OVER THE YEARS THERE'S BEEN NO DIFFERENCE. IT'S ABOUT 18% 1118% LIKELIHOOD WHETHER PROP FIFTY SEVEN PROST PROFIT. SEVEN WE'RE GETTING. WHEN YOU GO ABOVE THE PROBE OR DO A DIFFERENT IN DATA. SOME OF THE MEASURE- A CREATED A NEW PEARL PROCESS FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS- THAT THE RELEASE RATE IS AROUND THAT THE NUMBER THAT YOU CITED. IT HAS CHANGED MAYBE SLIGHTLY IN RECENT YEARS BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE COULD GO AHEAD GOOD THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS THAT- THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR PAROLE NOW UNDER PROPERTY SEVEN THAT ONE TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR PAROLE. ABSENT THE MEASURE AND SO WELL THOSE FOLKS ARE GETTING RELEASED AT THE SORT OF HISTORIC 18% RATE THOSE FOLKS WANT OF BEEN RELEASED WITHOUT THE MEASURE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GO BEFORE CORRECT CORRECT- BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT. POINT HERE IS. I THINK WOULD BE WITH WORTH IT AND USEFUL TO GET SOME MORE DATA BECAUSE. PART OF THE PURPOSE OF FIFTY SEVEN. WAS NOT ONLY TO LOOK AT HOW WE SENSE MORE RATIONALLY AND HOW WE- TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING THAT- WE INTEND NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. IS THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. BUT IN FACT MY IN AND PART OF IT ALSO WAS TO ASSIST US IN MEETING THE COURT ORDERED GOAL FOR POPULATION REDUCTION. WHAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IS TO REALLY GET NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH IT REALLY HAS A CHEAP THAT SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE I WOULD IMAGINE THAT SOME OF THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS FEEL THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER A HUGE WHOLESALE INCREASE IN PEOPLE WHO WERE WHO WERE IMPRISONED BEING RELEASED AND I REALLY DOUBT THAT'S THE CASE BUT- IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT. WE COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THE YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE DECENT DATA. IF THAT BE HELPFUL IN. THANK YOU- LET'S SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS TO ALEJO. ALRIGHT SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO. WHAT WE HOPED WOULD BE THE PROPONENTS OF THE- INITIATIVE AND AS I MENTIONED- NINA SALERNO FROM CRIME VICTIMS UNITED WAS GOING TO PRESENT BUT SHE CALLED US LATE YESTERDAY AND INDICATED THAT SHE- HAD WITH IS NOW ILL AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO IS THERE ANYONE ELSE FROM CRIME VICTIMS UNITED. WHO WOULD. LIKE TO ADDRESS S. I'M ALL RIGHT WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE NEXT PART OF OUR AGENDA AND IF A PROPONENT OF THE INITIATIVE IS ABLE TO BE HERE BEFORE WE CONCLUDE WE WILL GIVE THEM TIME ON THAT DíAS. SO LET'S GO NOW TO THE TOP MOMENTS AND OF WE WILL HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND WELCOME NEW MEMBERS WHO HAVE JOINED US SOME DATA CENTER BRADFORD ST THE MEMBER LACKEY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- KAMLAGER DEATH. THANK YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR NEW INTRODUCE YOURSELF. HELLO THIS. YOU'RE RIGHT AWAY. GOOD MORNING THERE WE GO MY NAME'S LENORE ANDERSON ON THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY THIS BALLOT INITIATIVE IS UNNECESSARY IT TAKES A CALIFORNIA'S JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND IT WILL BE HARMFUL FOR PUBLIC SAFETY FOR CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND FOR THE STATE BUDGET. THE BACKERS OF THE MEASURE WOULD LIKE VOTERS TO FORGET ABOUT THE DECADE LONG DECADES LONG FAILED EXPERIMENT IN OVER INCARCERATION AND RETURN TO THE FAILED APPROACHES OF THE PAST WE ANTICIPATE THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS ARE SMARTER THAN THAT AND THE MEASURE WILL BE REJECTED IN NOVEMBER FIRST ALL DESCRIBE FOUR COMPONENTS OF THE MEASURE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND AND THEN I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW IT IS UNNECESSARY TAKES US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND WILL BE HARMFUL TO OUR STATE. THE MEASURE REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN THAT WAS THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT CHANGED SIX LOW LEVEL CRIMES FROM FELONIES TO MISDEMEANORS AND ANNUALLY RE ALLOCATES PRISON DOLLARS TO TREATMENT AND VICTIM SERVICES SPECIFICALLY THIS MEASURE AUTHORIZES FELONY CONVICTIONS FOR LOW LEVEL THEFT CRIMES BY REDUCING THE FELONY THRESHOLD FROM NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOR SPECIFIED OFFENSES CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST PHONY THRESHOLDS FOR THEFT CRIMES IN THE NATION FOR EXAMPLE IN TEXAS THE PHONY THRESHOLD IS TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS IS WAY OUT OF LINE WITH WHAT VOTERS WANT SECOND IT REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT REQUIRES REHABILITATION FOR PEOPLE IN PRISON SPECIFICALLY IT DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF OFFENSES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR REHABILITATION CREDITS TOWARDS RELEASE IT ALLEGES THAT IS ENSURING THAT A BUNCH OF CRIMES WILL THEN BE CONSIDERED VILE. IT'S BUT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT CHANGING THE SENTENCING OF ANY OF THOSE CRIMES AT ALL INSTEAD IT SIMPLY PREVENTING PEOPLE IN PRISON FOR THERE'S CRIMES FROM BEING INCENTIVIZED TO COMPLETE REHABILITATION AND PREPARE FOR RELEASE. NEXT THE MEASURE REPEALS KEY ASPECTS OF PROPS OF TWENTY ELEVENS PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENTS BY AUTHORIZING PEOPLE- ON COMMUNITY SUPERVISION WHO VIOLATE SOME TERMS A RETURN TO PRISON INSTEAD OF USING LOCAL GRADUATED SANCTIONS THIS WILL DRIVE THE PRISON POPULATION UP. FOURTH AND REALLY IMPORTANTLY. THIS IS A MEASURE THAT WILL REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF STATE MONEY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CRIME PREVENTION AND SMARTER APPROACHES TO LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY. PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN HAS ALREADY SAVED AN ESTIMATED HALF A BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S MONEY FOR VICTIMS SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND YOUTH PROGRAMS. THAT WILL REDUCE IF THE POPULATION GOES UP. BACKERS OF THIS MEASURE ARE FOCUSED ON FEAR MONGERING TO PAINT A GRIM PICTURE THAT JUSTICE REFORM IS CONTRIBUTING TO VIOLENT CRIME. THAT IS FALSE. CRIME CALIFORNIA REMAINS AT HISTORIC LOWS SHIFTS IN CRIME RATES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT HOLD CONSISTENTLY STATEWIDE THE VERY MARKEDLY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. STATE POLICY IS NOT THE PROBLEM THIS MEASURE IS UNNECESSARY. IT'S UNNECESSARY TO IMPROVE RESPONSES TO LOW LEVEL CRIMES BECAUSE FIRST THE VAST MAJORITY OF LOW LEVEL CRIMES ARE NOT REPORTED TO POLICE THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE LONG BEFORE THE JUSTICE REFORM ERA EMERGED. PROPERTY CRIME CLEARANCE RATES ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 20% SO A FOCUS ON SENTENCING PEOPLE CONVICTED IS IT HAS A VERY LIMITED IMPACT CRIME PREVENTION HAS A MUCH BROADER REACH SECOND IT'S UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE TOOLS ALREADY EXIST. TO HOLD PEOPLE UP COULD BE CONVICTED OF LOW LEVEL CRIMES ACCOUNTABLE WHETHER THOSE TOOLS ARE USED LOCALLY OR NOT UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A- AND DETAIN ME. AND COURTS CAN ENGAGE IN A MIX OF SANCTIONS INCLUDING TREATMENT COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AND UP TO A YEAR IN JAILTIME AT AS WELL AS INCENTIVES TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. THIRD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN A. B. C. TEN SIXTY SIZE TEN- SIXTY FIVE LEGISLATION ALSO STRENGTHENED ORGANIZE RETAIL THEFT LAW TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO ARREST AND DETAIN PEOPLE- IN GAUGING IN REPEAT AFTER CRIMES. IT'S ALSO ON NECESSARY TO IMPROVE RESPONSES TO VIOLENT CRIME BECAUSE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT CRIME STILL KERRY LONG SENTENCES REGARDLESS OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ALL FELONIES BY DEFINITION ARE EITHER SERIOUS OR VIOLENT CRIMES AND CAN CARRY LENGTHY PRISON TERMS. THE PROBLEM IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT PROSECUTORS AND COURTS CAN ARE. SUFFICIENTLY LOCK PEOPLE UP FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME MANY THOUSANDS ARE INCARCERATED IN THIS STATE EVERY YEAR THE PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE PEOPLE ARE RELEASED AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THE PROPERTY SEVEN SOUGHT TO RESOLVE THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA STATE PRISONS. ARE GETTING OUT THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK IS DO WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE RELEASED PREPARED FOR RE ENTRY OR NOT BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REHABILITATION CREDITS WERE ACTUALLY HARMING PUBLIC SAFETY. NOT HELPING IT THERE'S NO RESEARCH THAT STATES THAT LONG SENTENCES AND WAREHOUSE STYLE INCARCERATION WORK IN FACT RESEARCH SAYS SHORTER SENTENCES WITH MORE INFORMATION. WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON PREPARATION FOR RELEASE IS IT WHAT REDUCES REPEAT OFFENDING. WORSE THAN BEING ON. THIS MEASURE IT WILL MOVE CALIFORNIA IN THE WRONG DIRECTION QUICKLY A COUPLE OF THE KEY REASONS IT'LL MOVE THE STATE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND LEAD TO MORE INCARCERATION IN MORE PRISON COSTS. ROUGH ESTIMATES THAT AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE INCARCERATED IN THE STATE ANNUALLY SECOND IT WILL LEAD TO MORE LITIGATION THIS STATE IS NOW JUST COMING OUT OF UNDER THE THUMB FROM FEDERAL LAWSUITS AND RETURNING TO NON COMPLIANCE WOULD BE HARMFUL. THIRD IT'LL LEAD TO FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STABILITY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH PAST FELONY CONVICTIONS FELONY CONVICTIONS COME WITH A LIFETIME OF CONSEQUENCES FROM PROHIBITIONS TO EMPLOYMENT TO HOUSING AND MORE. CREATING MORE FELONY CONVICTIONS FOR LOW LEVEL CRIME IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY AND WILL DESTABILIZE COMMUNITIES FURTHER. FOURTH THIS WILL ALSO LEAD TO FEWER DOLLARS TO HELP VICTIMS OF CRIME. IN JUST THE SHORT TIME SINCE PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN PASSED CALIFORNIA HAS GONE FROM HAVING ONLY ONE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER TO NOW HAVING FOURTEEN TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE. THESE ARE MODEL PROGRAMS THE SPECIFICALLY SIEGE SEARCH OUT AND FIND. UNDERSERVED VICTIMS OF CRIME VICTIMS OF CRIME OF SUCH AS SEXUAL ASSAULT AND OTHER CRIMES IN WHICH THE TRADITIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS BEEN LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO HELP THESE VICTIMS. WE NEED MORE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTERS NOT LESS. TO BE SURE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO TO ENSURE SAFETY AND DIGNITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND TO GROW JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WORKS EFFECTIVELY FOR EVERYONE. TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD WE ABSOLUTELY MUST BUILD MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE ENTERING THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. SCALE UP CISIS RESPONSE BUILD MORE TROUBLE FROM RECOVERY CENTERS AND MANY MORE REFORMS. BUT GOING BACKWARDS IS A DISASTROUS PROPOSAL OUR STATE IS JUST NOW RECOVERING FROM RACIALIZED FEAR MONGERING APPROACHES TO PUBLIC POLICY. OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE REAL HELP NOT A FEAR MONGERING SCAM THAT PRETENDS TO CARE ABOUT VICTIMS OF CRIME AND WE URGE THAT THIS MEASURE BE REJECTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KAMLAGER DOVE IN QUESTION MR LACKEY. I. THE THING THE THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION- I WHAT WASN'T TOUCHED ON AND I SHOULD VAST ILIO ALSO BUT PART OF OUR- HI PRISON POPULATION IS WE STILL HAVE HIGH RECIDIVISM RATES. AND MEANING WE AND THERE'S LOTS ONE COULD ARGUE. WELL IT IT'S GOOD TO SEE DATA AROUND RECIDIVISM BECAUSE SOME OF OUR RECIDIVISM IS DUE TO ANOTHER CRIME THAT WAS COMMITTED BUT SOME IS STILL DUE TO VIOLATIONS AND NOT NECESSARILY THAT IN OTHER CRIME WAS COMMITTED. FIVE AND I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE OF IF WE CREATE. A BROADER CATEGORY OF PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GET FELONIES THAT WE THEN HAVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ONE ONE STATE ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE ARRESTED AND CONVICTED AND SERVED TIME FOR THEIR PHONY ONCE THEY RETURN HOME THEY HAVE THIS VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCE IN FACT FOR EVER. OF EITHER GETTING GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT OR SECURING HOUSING OR VARIETY OF THINGS TO DO TO THAT FELONY CONVICTION SO COULD YOU SPEAK TO FOR A MOMENT AROUND THE CONNECTION TO RECIDIVISM WHICH IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IF WE ARE BOTH TRYING TO REDUCE THE POPULATION IN OUR PRISONS AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER. THE ABSOLUTELY IF SO WHAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS- WANT MORE THAN ANYTHING FROM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A SYSTEM THAT HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE STOPS CYCLES OF CRIME AND GIVES PEOPLE A PATHWAY TO MEETING FOR REHABILITATION AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION WE TALK ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY POST CONVICTION AFTER YOUR TIME IS DONE WHAT WE SEE IN CALIFORNIA IT LIKE MANY STATES IS IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO GET BACK ON YOUR FEET. EFFECTIVELY AND QUICKLY WHEN YOU'RE LIVING WITH A PAST FELONY CONVICTION IT WASN'T JUST THE INCARCERATION RATES THAT SKYROCKETED IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES IT WAS ALSO THE NUMBER OF FELONIES IN THE PENAL CODES AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE CONVICTED OF FELONY OFFENSES ONE IN EIGHT CALIFORNIANS HAS A FELONY CONVICTION ON THEIR PAST RECORD THE QUESTION WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES IS WHAT DOES MEANING FOR REHABILITATION REALLY MEAN PEOPLE HAVE COMPLETED TERMS OF THE SENTENCE THE OPPORTUNITY SHOULD BE TO GET TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT ACCESS TO A STABLE HOUSING ACCESS TO JOBS THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFE WHEN WE PREVENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE. ARE TO GAIN ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL REHABILITATION WORK HARMING PUBLIC SAFETY AND REDUCING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE PERSON CAN STAY OUT OF THE CYCLE OF CRIME. MS COME A GOOD OVEN IN A. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THIS INITIATIVE ARE NOT HERE- AND I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT TIME I'M SORRY FOR THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE YOU CREATE A VACUUM FOR ARGUING YOUR POINT ALTHOUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE NOT. AND I ALSO WANT TO STATE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS- ON THESE COMMITTEES IS COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY BUT IT'S FIGURING OUT HOW TO INSERT EQUITY. AND JUSTICE- INTO THAT I WOULD HOPING THAT YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORT OF. POST RELEASE SUPERVISION. AND SORT OF WHERE WE FALL SHORT WHERE THIS INITIATIVE MACE FALL SHORT- AND HAT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE AS I LOOK THROUGH SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS IT APPEARS TO BE RATHER DRACONIAN TO ME. BUT IT'S ALSO. SORT OF LIKE HOW YOU WOULD TREAT A DOG IN A SHELTER- AND NOT REALLY ADDRESSING YOU KNOW TRIGGERS- THAT PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HOW LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER- FOLKS INTERACT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT YOU KNOW TATTOOS ARE. ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS RACE WHERE THEY COME FROM pPROGRAMS THAT THEY PARTICIPATED IN WHILE THEY WERE INCARCERATED WHERE THEY HAVE EXCELLED I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND RECIDIVISM RATE AND LOWERING THOSE NUMBERS. FIGURING OUT HOW YOU WE CAN BEGIN TO INTERACT TO RE INTERACT WITH FOLKS IN A WAY THAT IS SUCCESSFUL AND COMPASSIONATE HOLDS FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE BUT DOESN'T TREAT THEM LIKE ANIMALS ON THE STREET. SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT'S NOT IN HERE AND MAYBE YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT ON A BROADER LEVEL AS IT RELATES TO THAT. AT ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. WHY ARE ORGANIZATION CONDUCTED A- PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH STUDY AND IN TWENTY. EIGHTEEN WHERE WE- INTERVIEWED CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH PAST CONVICTIONS TO TRY TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF. THE EXPERIENCE BOTH LIVING WITH THE PAST CONVICTION BUT ALSO- THE CONNECTION BETWEEN INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR IN CRIME IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND ONE IN TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. ANSWERED THAT EITHER A SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR MENTAL HEALTH OF IT CHALLENGES LEAD TO INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME RIGHT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE DRIVERS OF CRIME WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MAKING COMMUNITY SAFER. THIS ISN'T IT'S NOT A MYSTERY WHAT HAPPENS IN THE IN THE PATHWAY TOWARDS- INVOLVEMENT IN CRIME. THE REAL MYSTERY IS WHY ARE WE ADDRESSING THOSE DRIVERS OF CRIME ON THE FRONT END- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHO'S IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE EXPERIENCING STRUGGLES WITH DRUG ABUSE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE NOT ABLE TO QUICKLY AND READILY ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT. THAT SHOULD BE A PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITY THAT SHOULD BE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY SAFETY ONE WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE AT THE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE FAILURE TO DO SO. AP IS PART OF WHAT IS SO. DISINGENUOUS ABOUT BOTH THIS MEASURE AND THE AND THE BROADER BOB MASS INCARCERATION ERA THAT WE'RE RECOVERING FROM. INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING THE CYCLE OF CRIME OR OBVIOUS STOPPING IT. IN MANY WAYS THE EXPLOSION OF THE PRISON SYSTEM AND THE TOUGH PUNISHMENT APPROACH TO PUBLIC SAFETY. IT REALLY ACTUALLY HAS DONE MORE TO SUBSIDIZE. CYCLES OF CRIME THAN IT HAS TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THEM OR STOP THEM. WE KNOW HOW TO MAKE COMMUNITY SAFE WE'VE GOT. TO TALK ABOUT TRAUMA AND TRAUMA RECOVERY FOR CAN. WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT MENTAL TREATMENT SUB ABUSE TREATMENT AND GIVING PEOPLE REAL STABILITY DIGNITY AND STABILITY AFTER THEIR TIME IS DONE THAT'S WHAT WOULD REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING FROM THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. YEAH THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL I'D I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT- THE MAJORITY THE PEOPLE ON THIS DIRE CENTER THAT ARE IN HERE TODAY ARE NOT IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BUT I DO THINK IT'S UNFAIR TO INSINUATED SUPPORTERS WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE IT THIS MORNING WERE SOMEWHERE INTENTIONALLY ABSENT AND I DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY AND I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. SECONDLY YOU DID MENTION THAT TO ONE OUT OF A CALIFORNIANS HAVE A FELONY ON THE RECORD IS THAT THE RIGHT ONE IN A CALIFORNIANS HAS A CONVICTION. OKAY WE'RE THAT STOCK COME FROM SHOCKING RESEARCH THAT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DATA FROM THE STATE. OKAY NOT NOT THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE STATE NOW OKAY THERE. SHE HIGHER NATIONALLY OKAY I'D LIKE TO JUST FOLLOW THAT UP WITH THANK YOU. YES SENATE JACKSON THANK YOU- IN AND I'M DISAPPOINTED TO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPONENTS AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO SPECULATE AS TO WHY NOT BUT THIS IS THEIR INITIATIVE AND- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL TO HEAR FROM THEM BUT- THAT BEING SAID- I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR PASSION ON THIS ISSUE AND- SOME OF THE STATISTICS WHICH ARE KIND OF STUNNING- BUT- I'M WONDERING. IF PART OF THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF REHABILITATION AND SO WE CAN REDUCE THE RECIDIVISM RATE REALLY DEALS WITH THE KIND OF PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHILE INCARCERATED. AND IT'S BEEN A FRUSTRATION TO ME- TO FIND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS HAS A VIRTUALLY OPAQUE- APPROACH TO- SHARING WITH US AS LEGISLATORS- IS TO SAY NOTHING OF THE PUBLIC JUST EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES EXIST IN PRISON FOR PEOPLE- SO THAT THEY CAN LEARN A TRADE SO THEY CAN DEAL WITH THEIR ANGER MANAGEMENT OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WHAT HAVE YOU- SUPPOSEDLY WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THAT. BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT SO THAT WE CAN REALLY HOLD THIS DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTABLE IT TAKES WHAT ABOUT GOES TO CORRECTIONS AND IF WE'RE NOT SEEING A REAL IMPROVEMENT IN A REDUCTION IN OUR RECIDIVISM RATE WHEN WE KNOW. WHAT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE THAT WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM I'M WONDERING IF MY CHARACTERIZATION IS SEEN IN YOUR OPINION- INACCURATE OR WHAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND WE DO TO TRY TO LIFT THE VEIL OF SECRECY THAT EXISTS IN HALF FOR DECADES IN THIS AGENCY IN IN THIS DEPARTMENT. WE SAW A COUPLE COUPLE OF THOUGHTS RESPONSE YOUR QUESTION THE FIRST IS THAT WHAT IS PROMISING. A ABOUT THE STATE OF CORRECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT AS THE- PRISON CROWDING PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED AND AS WE'VE SEEN A FEW WERE OF PEOPLE IN PRISON IT'S ACTUALLY INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE EMPHASIS ON REHABILITATION. SO THAT TODAY THERE'S PROBABLY MORE REHABILITATION INSIDE A CALIFORNIA'S CORRECTION SYSTEM THEN THERE HAS BEEN EVER. AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD POSITIVE DIRECTION THAT WE SHOULD BE APPLAUDING AND THANKING CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM FOR MAKING POSSIBLE RIGHT BECAUSE- WE HAVE HAD A SEVERE PRISON CROWDING CRISIS FOR SO MANY DECADES THAT EVEN. THE BEST OF INTENTIONS ON THE PART OF A PEOPLE RUNNING THE SYSTEM WOULD BE WHERE WOULD YOU PUT THE REHABILITATION IF PEOPLE- ARE IAN- DOUBLE TRIPLE BOX AND SO CROWDED IN THE SYSTEM SO THE FIRST STEP TO CHANGING THE CULTURE OF CORRECTIONS. IS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY IN IT ONCE WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UNNECESSARILY IN IT WE CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE OF CORRECTIONS BY CHANGE HOW WE TRAIN OUR PEOPLE IN THE CORRECTIONS SYSTEM. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT GOES TOWARDS TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND THEN CHANGING THE STANDARDS BY WHICH WERE MEASURING OUR SUCCESS UPON RELEASE REHABILITATION HAS GOT TO BE FRONT AND CENTER. IN OUR APPROACH TO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IN THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES WITH OUR A CORRECTION SYSTEM. YES IN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I. TOO I'M SORRY THAT THERE ISN'T A PROPONENT- SO I'M NOT GONNA ASK QUESTIONS TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR JUST AS A AS A FORMERCOUNTY SUPERVISOR I WAS SENT. I WAS CHAIRMAN IN TWENTY TWELVE AND IN AB ONE ON NINE WAS PASSED IN THE TWENTY ELEVEN SO I. HAD THE JOYS OF DEALING WITH. THE REVERBERATIONS OF THE EARLY RELEASE. THEN FOLLOWED BY FORTY SEVEN AND FIFTY SEVEN SO. BUT I'M NOT HERE TO DEFEND THE BALLOT MEASURE BUT I I'M HERE TO SAY THAT ANECDOTALLY I HAVE PLENTY OF CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE COME TO ME AND- HAVE OBSERVED. SOME CHANGES IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE EARLY RELEASE OF PRISONERS IS HIT IT THERE'S A CORRELATION TO THE INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND OUR COMMUNITIES BUT I'M CERTAINLY. A RECIPIENT OF A OF A LOT OF CONCERNS SO THERE FOR SOMEONE HAS FUNDED THE ABILITY TO RAISE. ENOUGH SIGNATURES AND I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS- SO I CAN'T ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS- I WOULD MAYBE ASSUME IT COULD BE RETAILERS. WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR STORES BECAUSE- IF THEY HAVE A SHOPLIFTING ISSUE THEN THEN THOSE COSTS ARE. PASSED ALONG TO- TO CONSUMERS AND CONSUMERS ARE CONSTITUENTS. AND SO WE HAVE A REACTION SO I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT- MISS ANDERSON IS SAID IN. AN A YOU CERTAINLY KNOW WHERE I'M AT WITH TRYING TO DEAL WITH- MENTAL SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND ALL THE REST AS IT RELATES TO. INDIVIDUALS IN CRIME AND LOWERS LINE AND SO I'M I'M IN THAT SPACE. BUT SOMEHOW THERE'S A REACTION. AND HOW DO WE FIND THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE IF THIS IS NOT IT BEEN WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO. TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE FEELING SAFE ABOUT GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE OR WHEREVER THEY GO DURING THEIR DAILY. LIFE AND CHORES SO THAT WOULD BE MY- CONTRIBUTION TO THIS. DISCUSSION AND AGAIN I'M I'M SORRY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPONENTS HER YEAH. THANK YOU AND- IN. TAKE YOUR AGENT OKAY. LOOK I I'M PROBABLY GONNA REVISIT- ORGANIZED RETAIL DEATH LOG IN BECAUSE ALSO BELIEVE. AT THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEGISLATIVELY MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT COULD HELP WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON OUT THERE AND- I'M JUST GONNA REGION ARTICLE. FROM SAN FRANCISCO GATE- THAT ARE IN USE A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE- WEDNESDAY TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWENTY. THREE OAKLAND SISTERS HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH RUNNING A RETAIL THEFT RING. THAT INVOLVES SELLING MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF MERCHANDISE. THE THREE SISTERS WERE CHARGED ON JANUARY FOURTEENTH MY BIRTHDAY INSTANTLY. WITH FELONY COUNTS OF ORGANIZED RETAIL THAT AFFECTIONATELY CALLED J. SORT. IN CONCERT WITH TO MORE PEOPLE DIRECTING ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY HAYWARD POLICE SAID THAT THEY STEPPED UP THEIR PRESENCE AT THE MALL. THAT THE NUMBER OF GRAB AND RUN DEATHS DECREASED AND ONE STORE EVEN SAID IT HASN'T HAD A GRAB AND RUN SINCE THE INCREASED AND POLICE PRESENCE. THE SISTERS EVEN SOLD ITEMS IN THE BACK AND SIDE YARDS AT THEIR OAKLAND HOMES WHICH WERE CONVERTED INTO STORE AREAS COMPLETE WITH THE WEATHER PROTECTION. CLOTHING RACKS SHELVING LIGHTING HEATING GLASS DISPLAY CASES SHOPPING BAGS AND PAY LEDGERS. AMONG THE STORES IN DIFFERENT CITIES THAT WERE TARGETED WERE MACY'S TARGET JC PENNEY HOME DEPOT VICTORIA'S SECRET ON ALL ALL TRIBUTE. AT AMERICAN EAGLE. THE POINT I'M MAKING IS LEGISLATIVELY WE DD SOMETHING TO TRY TO COMBAT THIS AND WE CAN DO THAT ESPECIALLY WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE TAKING THIS TO THAT LEVEL OF CRIMINALITY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE. GOVERNOR SIGN CREATE A LAW. TO HANDLE SOME OF THAT ESPECIALLY THE MOST EGREGIOUS ONCE. WHAT I HEAR YOU WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE SAYING ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I WILL LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED ME WRITE THIS LONG ONE WITH THE RETAILERS AND THE CHAMBER. THEY CAME IN TO HELP ME WRITE ORGANIZED RETAIL DEATH NOT EVERYONE IN HIS AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT ME FUNNY WOOD WHAT'S WHAT'S PROBABLY ON BOARD WITH IT. BUT WE NEEDED TO DO SOMETHING- TO DEAL WITH AND TAKE US WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY TOOK THAT THAT STEP AND SO I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO OFFER. THAT OUT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TO COME UP WITH- WAYS IF THERE'S SOME LOOPHOLES OR TO THINGS THAT FELL UPON TO CRACKS. WE'RE HERE TO- MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS TO WE DIDN'T NEED TO. PROBABLY GO TO THIS KIND OF EFFORT AND SO I IN A NIGHT. I WILL OFFER MY- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SENATE WE'RE STILL HERE- TO MAKE SURE THAT ONE WE PROTECT PEOPLE WHO NEED REHABILITATION. I DID NOT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN SEIZE DC ARE ALL WORKING. AND THE ONES THAT AREN'T WORKING WE EITHER GET GET THE MORE MORE FUNDING- WE GET A BETTER HELP OR TO JUST NOT WORKING AT ALL WE DISCONTINUE THEM AT A MOVE THAT MONEY. TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORKING AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T RECIDIVISTS SPECIALLY FOR SPENDING EIGHTY. EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO INCARCERATE SOMEONE I RATHER HAVE SOMEONE OUT WORKING. NOT STEALING- CONTRIBUTED COMMUNITY RAISING A FAMILY PAYING TAXES. IN A LOT OF TAXES AND BECOME A- OF. A MEMBER OF THE OF CALIFORNIA SOCIETY AND SO WITH THAT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS A CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. WITH THE CRIMINALITY OF IT SPACE AT THE HIGHER LEVELS BUT WE ALSO NEED TO WE NEED TO REALLY STEP UP OUR REHABILITATION PROCESS BECAUSE- AND I'M NOT THROWING AB ONE ON ONE OH NINE PEOPLE INTO THE BRIDGE BUT- UNDER WHAT. BUT MOST OF US HERE WE DIDN'T WE ARE PART OF THAT. AND I THINK WE NEED IT PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE- SAME WITH FIFTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE JUST NEED TO IMPLEMENTED BETTER. AND I THINK THAT'S WHY SOME THE ANGST THAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM. INDIVIDUALS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS. AND SO I'M I'M HOPING THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD EVEN THIS YEAR THAT PEOPLE COME TO. TO OUR OFFICES WITH WAYS WE CAN BOTH ADDRESS BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS. THE ONLY THING I WANTED TO RAISE WHICH YOU DID NOT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER IS THAT. THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT LAW WAS. WORKED ON AND THEN PASSED. IN EFFECT CONCURRENTLY WITH THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION OF THIS INITIATIVE AND WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPONENTS HERE TO KNOW WHETHER. IF IT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING BUT AGAIN THIS IS NOW SPECULATION SINCE THEY'RE OUT HERE THAT SOME WHO WERE INVOLVED IN BE. SIGNATURE GATHERING IN THE RICH INITIAL PART OF THE INITIATIVE. WE WERE HAVE SOME AT ARE LESS THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT AS AS ENTHUSIASTIC OR- THEY MAY NOT HAVE- COMPLETELY STEP BACK TO OPPOSE THE INITIATIVE BUT THERE THE WORST FEELING QUITE- COULD ABOUT THE ORGANIZED RETAIL THEFT LOT THAT WAS PUT INTO EFFECT BUT AGAIN WE WON'T REALLY KNOW THAT UNLESS THEY'RE HERE TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES BUT IT I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT TIMING. THAT THE LAW THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER JONES SAWYER WAS DEVELOPED CONCURRENTLY TO THE POINT THAT THEY WERE GATHERING SIGNATURES SO. COME OF I HAVE- ANOTHER QUESTION SO. BROWN VERSUS PLOTTED OUT WITH PRISON OVERCROWDING IN CALIFORNIA. WITH THIS INITIATIVE PUT. US OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH BOTTOM IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO SO BY INCREASING THE PRISON POPULATION AGAIN YES. IN TWO WEEKS. YES THANK YOU A TO COURT BRITAIN THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING. AND THEN. GO OUR NEXT AND THE LAST PRESENTATION WILL BE REGARDING OTHER POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT MAY- THAT MAY BE WORTH CONSIDERING IN RELATIONSHIP TO ANALYZING THIS INITIATIVE AND FOR THAT WE WILL HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA BRIAN RECORD DID I PRONOUNCE THAT. CHART RETURN RICH CHART OKAY- THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING SHARES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- MY NAME IS BRIAN RICHARDS- I SERVICE THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER FOR THE COUNTY OF ELDORADO APPEAR TO THE EAST AND I A ALSO SERVE FAN IN HERE TODAY IN MY CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT OF THE G. PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA- THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. WE STRONGLY SHARED SENTIMENT DISCUSSED HERE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA MUST PROMOTE POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF ALL ITS CITIZENS INCLUDING VICTIMS OF CRIME AND MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. IS LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERS OURSELVES PROBATION SHE'S REMAIN IN DOGGED PURSUIT OF WHAT WORKS BEST PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY WE BELIEVE CRIME PREVENTION AND AVOIDANCE IS THE BEST FORM OF PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WHEN WE FOLLOW RESEARCH EVIDENCE AND DATA TO GUIDE SYSTEMS AND POLICY CHANGE WE MOVE FURTHER TOWARD THAT GOAL. IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO USE STATE AND RESEARCH TO EVALUATE WHERE CHANGE IS NEEDED AND WHAT THOSE CHANGES SHOULD BE. WE MUST TO DO THIS WITH THE GOAL OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE SHOULD NEVER REST IN THAT PURSUIT. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THAT REDUCTIONS IN CRIME ARE BEST ACHIEVED BY INTERRUPTING THE CRIMINAL CYCLE AND CHANGING A PERSONS LONG TERM BEHAVIOR. BY ADDRESSING THEIR THOUGHT PROCESSES. THIS IS COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. I OFTEN TELL STORY- ONE TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT PROBATION DOES TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT. WELL IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IF THERE'S SOMEBODY TRYING TO KICK IN MY FRONT DOOR I AM GOING TO CALL NINE ONE ONE AND I WANT TO SHARE STEP IF YOU'RE A POLICE OFFICER THERE. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BUT WHAT I REALLY WOULD PREFER. IS THAT SOMETIME BEFORE THAT THREE AM PHONE CALL. THERE WERE A PROBATION OFFICER WORKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL IN SUCH A WAY THAT PREVENTED HIM FROM EVER BEING THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND TO ME THAT'S THE WORK OF COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. INTERRUPTING THE CRIMINAL CYCLE REQUIRES A CAREFUL BALANCE OF NECESSARY ACCOUNTABILITY AND WELL THOUGHT OUT INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDE PROPER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS RICH TO RE OFFEND AS WELL AS CRIMINAL GENIC. AND NON CRIMINAL GENIC NEEDS. WE'LL SEE BALK DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION ON INITIATIVE EIGHTEEN FORTY THERE ARE PROVISIONS WITHIN IT THAT WOULD GREATLY IMPACT OUR WORK WITH CLIENTS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE OUR PROVISIONS IN THIS INITIATIVE THAT ARE WELL REASONED AND WORTHY OF DISCUSSION. WE'RE HERE TO OFFER OUR INSIDE IN THESE PROVISIONS AND OTHERS IS THE COMMITTEE CARRIES OUT A CHARGE. FIRST THE INITIATIVE LOOKS TO MODIFY POLICIES ESTABLISHED WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN LET ME STATE UP FRONT. OUR ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED PROP FIFTY SEVEN. BASED ON A COLLECTIVE NATION WIDE EXPERIENCE WE KNOW THAT WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT PRACTICE IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVEN TO WORK IN CHANGING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR YOU DECREASE THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM. AND WHEN YOU DECREASE THE RISK OF RECIDIVISM YOU DECREASE CRIME. AND YOU CREATE SAFER COMMUNITIES. AREAS ASPECTS PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE PROMOTED THESE PRACTICES MOVE THE NEEDLE TOWARD IMPROVED OUTCOMES. ADDITIONALLY PROP FIFTY SEVEN WAS A THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDER RESPONSE TO CONTINUED PRESSURE FROM THE FEDERAL COURTS WHO DEMANDED THE CALIFORNIA DO SOMETHING TO EASE THE OVERCROWDING IN OUR PRISONS OR RISK HAVING FEDERAL OFFICIALS- DO THAT FOR US. RELEASING PERSONS BASED ON SOME ARBITRARY ELEMENTS SUCH AS THEIR TIME IN RESIDENTS OR CRIME COMMITTED RATHER THAN THEIR PREPAREDNESS FOR RELEASE WOULD HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AS PREPARED ANALYSIS FOR TODAY'S HEARING CORRECTLY POINTS OUT WE MUST REMAIN CONCERNED THE CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM BE VIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY POTENTIAL PRESSURES ON OUR PRISON CAPACITY. WHICH COULD LEAD TO FUTURE ARBITRARY RELEASES. THE CHIEFS HAVE CONSISTENTLY TAKEN A POSITION THAT ARBITRARY RELEASES WOULD RESULT NEGATIVELY ON PUBLIC SAFETY. MAKING THE MOST WELL REASONED INSUPPORTABLE CHANGES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IS OF PARAMOUNT GUIDE FOR OUR PREVIOUS POSITIONS AND WILL BE THE SAME LENS THROUGH WHICH WE ANALYZE AND PINE AND ALL PROPOSED POLICY CHANGES. INCLUDING THE ONES HERE TODAY. NEXT WE WOULD POINT TO A SPECIFIC PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE INITIATIVE THAT WOULD REQUIRE A PETITION FOR REVOCATION FIRED BY THE COURT UPON ANY THREE VIOLATIONS OF PROBATION. OVER THE LAST DECADE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT AND EFFECTIVE POLICY REFORMS HAVE OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT. AND THE ENACTMENT OF SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT. THESE EFFORTS WERE STRUCTURED ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF PROVIDING LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS OFFENDER BEHAVIOR IN A MANNER BEST FIT TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE INDIVIDUAL VERSUS TO PRESCRIBE ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES SAYS THE BETTER OUTCOMES ARE ACHIEVED BY USING INTERMEDIATE AND GRADUATED SANCTIONS THAT ARE COMMENSURATE WITH THE VIOLATIONS AND CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CLIENT. OVER REACTION JUST AS UNDER REACTION BY THE SYSTEM CAN AND DOES HAVE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES TO THE HUMAN CHANGE PROCESS ELAINE REHABILITATION RISKING FURTHER HARM TO THE COMMUNITY. REMOVING DISCRETION AND PROGRAMMING RESPONSES INTO OUR WORK INSURERS ONLY A SHORT TERM RESPONSE NOT A POSITIVE OUTCOME IN A CASE. GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE. WENT OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME YOU HAVE A CLIENT WHO MIGHT COMMIT THREE TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS PROBATION LET'S CALL IT A FAILED DRUG TESTS- FAILURE TO SHOW UP TO THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT IN AB A FAILED TREATMENT APPOINTMENT. BUT THERE OTHERWISE COMMITTED TO- LONG TERM REHABILITATION PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE PERFORMING WELL IN. THAT THEY ARE SHOWING A DISTANCE IN THEIR BEHAVIOR IF NOT- COMPLETE ABOLITION OF THE NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR. IT NEEDS TO BE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE PROFESSIONALS AS TO WHAT TO DO AFTER THAT THIRD TECHNICAL VIOLATION OCCURS. AND PRESCRIBE IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER. PLEASE DON'T MISUNDERSTAND FROM WHERE WE'RE COMING. COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS SHOULD AVAIL OURSELVES OF ALL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY. AT TIMES A CUSTODIAL RESPONSES ABSOLUTELY APPROPRIATE. IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE AND RESEARCH SUPPORTS THIS SOMETIMES A CUSTODIAL RESPONSES APPROPRIATE AT THE FIRST TECHNICAL VIOLATION. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A HIGH RISK OFFENDER EARLY IN THEIR SUPERVISION NOT YET POSSESSING SOME THE TOOLS NECESSARY TO REMAIN CRIME FREE AND WHO DELIVERS THAT SAME FAILED DRUG TESTER THAT SAY MISSED APPOINTMENT. YOU'RE DEALING WITH A VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF PERSON AT THAT POINT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. AND ALEX STILL REAL SANCTION MAY BE THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE ON THAT FIRST VIOLATION. BUT FOR MOST EVENTS THIS IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE INDISCRETION SHOULD NEVER BE TAKEN OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE PROFESSIONALS WHO KNOW BEST WHEN AND HOW TO EXERCISE IT. WE USE THE DATA FROM ALL OF OUR EVIDENCE BASED TOOLS AND APPROACHES TO GUIDE OUR DECISIONS INTERVENTIONS. MUCH LIKE YOUR DOCTOR PRESCRIBES A TYPE AND DOSAGE OF MEDICINE BASED ON BEST PRACTICES. THEY DO THAT IN CONCERT WITH PATIENT SPECIFIC FACTORS. IF YOUR DOCTOR SAID SHE WAS THE THIRD TIME I'VE SEEN YOU IN MY OFFICE WITH CHEST PAIN THE BOOK SAYS WERE DOING SURGERY. AND EATING CONSIDER ANY OTHER FACTORS IN THAT DIAGNOSIS OR THAT. TREATMENT INTERVENTION I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU FIND A NEW DOCTOR. IT SHOULDN'T BE ANY DIFFERENT WITH YOUR COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS. IF YOU'RE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS OFFICIALS ARE GOING TO THE BOOK TO DETERMINE WHAT TO DO NEXT RATHER THAN TAKING A LOOK AT YOUR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. THEN YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LET ASKING FOR NEW PROBATION OFFICER. PROBATION IS GUIDED BY TOOLS AND PROFESSIONAL TRAINING TO PROVIDE THE CORRECT TYPE AND DOSAGE OF SANCTIONS SUPPORTS INTERVENTIONS THE BEST ADDRESS THE CRIMINAL GENIC FACTORS IN SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO OUR CLIENTS BUT ALSO LIKE IN MEDICINE WE CAN SEE BASED ON FACTORS RELATED TO THE SPECIFIC% CASE WHEN THE APPLICATION OF THE MOST COMMON INTERVENTION IS. INDICATED IT IS THIS ABILITY TO BE DISCREET AND OUR INTERVENTIONS THAT GIVES US THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR AND PURSUE OUR GOAL TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF CRIME. WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVIDENCE WHICH SUPPORTS A COURT REVOCATION OR OTHER PREDETERMINED SANCTION AFTER THREE FOR ANY OTHER NUMBER OF NON CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS HAVING A LONG TERM POSITIVE IMPACT AND COMMUNITY SAFETY. UNFORTUNATELY THE PROPOSED CHANGE IN THIS INITIATIVE WOULD REMOVE THAT DISCRETION WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST AND LONG TERM CHANGE PROCESS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO OFFER SOME CONSIDERATIONS IS REYES RELATES TO RETAIL THEFT IMPROV FORTY SEVEN. SHE BALK WAS NEUTRAL ON PROP FORTY SEVEN- AS IT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS. AS WE LOOK TODAY THE MISDEMEANOR POPULATIONS BEING REFERENCED IN THIS INITIATIVE WE RECOGNIZE THERE ARE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK FOR SOME MISTER MINUTES PARTICULARLY THOSE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH RISK TO RE OFFEND. TO GET THEM LINKED TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND OTHER REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS TO INFLUENCE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. AND KEEP THEM FROM CYCLE IN IN AND OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND POSSIBLY ADVANCING ONE DAY TO FELONIOUS BEHAVIOR. CURRENTLY MOST HONEST MINUTES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T RECEIVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH TODAY'S PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. AS SUCH WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF CONSIDERATION WE SUPPORTED PAST EFFORTS SUCH AS AB TEN SIXTY FIVE A CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER. TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOR HIGH RISK MISDEMEANOR SUPERVISION ADDRESSING THE TYPES OF FENCES OF THIS INITIATIVE ALSO SEEKS TO ADDRESS WE KNOW THAT OUR APPROACH LIKE THE ONE PILOTED WHEREBY RESOURCES SUPERVISION BEST PRACTICES ARE LINKED TO A TOGETHER WE WILL HAVE THE BEST OUTCOMES IN ACHIEVING LASTING. POSITIVE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. IT IS OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO SEE PARK THAT AS OUR LEARNING INVOLVES AS OUR CONDITIONS CHANGE WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE OUR SYSTEM OF CORRECTIONS. IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT SEE PARK THAT WE AVOID CHANGING OUR SYSTEM ABSENCE SUPPORTIVE INFORMATION TO GUIDE THAT CHANGE. WE CONTINUE TO USE DATA AND RESEARCH TO EVALUATE AND BREAST EMBRACE CHANGES TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. WHICH ULTIMATELY WE KNOW IS THE GOAL THAT SHARED HERE BY EVERYONE TODAY THANK YOU.THANK YOU ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR A OR PROBATION CHIEF. UP GOOD SO- ON A TWIN A- WHEN THE FIRST LAW OFFERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IT EVER GOT THEM TO GO. I THOUGHT I WAS AN OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCES ON. THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE YES. SO I'VE I'VE SAID MANY TIMES- THAT- WE APPEAR MAKE LAWS BUT THE REAL WORK IS AT THE CRACK AT THE AT THE LEVEL THAT YOU'RE AT WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAWS AND SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- WAS PROP FIFTY SEVEN- FORTY SEVEN OR EVEN AB ONE OH NINE WE PROBABLY NEEDED TO PROBABLY CONSULT WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT. MORE AND YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING. ABOUT WHAT RESOURCES YOU NEEDED. SO THAT. ALL OF THESE SWEEPING CHANGES WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED THEY WOULD BE GOOD SO NOW. MMHM I'M GIVING YOU A OF BLANK CHECK BOOK IN IF YOU COULD TELL US IF WE FOR US TO MAKE ALL THOSE CHANGES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW TO US SO THAT WE WOULD NEED THESE PROPOSITIONS ARE WE WOULD NEED ORGANIZED RETAIL STEP. BUT IF WE COULD GIVE YOU ALL THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO BETTER IMPLEMENT EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO- YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ON A ON THE STATE LEVEL LOCAL LEVEL. WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD NEED OR IS THAT TOO MUCH ONE A ONE TIME. I WANNA LEGISLATOR ASKS YOU- WITH A CHECKBOOK WHAT YOU WOULD DO YOU ALWAYS BETTER COME PREPARED WITH. MR CHAIRED I THINK THE CITY PARK HAS A PRETTY- WELL ESTABLISHED TRACK RECORD- OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AT LEAST- AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF THE ORGANIZATION- FOR CLOSE TO FIFTEEN YEARS NOW. AND I WORKED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS I'VE I'VE WORKED IN AS SENATOR SKATERS JURISDICTION ALAMEDA COUNTY HAVE WORKED UP NORTH- AND SHASTA COUNTY AND NOW HERE NOW THE RATTLING SO I'VE SEEN A VARIETY OF ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT- PROBATION HAS ADVANCED IN MY TWENTY TWO ISSUE YEARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA- LEAPS AND BOUNDS BECAUSE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE- WHEN PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE SOLVED IN ALL REFERENCE AB ONE OR NINE FIRST- WHEN PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE SOLVED BIG HUGE. LIKE GROUND SWELL CHANGING PROBLEMS- SHE BOX BEEN THERE TO OFFER SOLUTIONS AND THE SOLUTIONS OF ALWAYS BEEN BASED AROUND PREVENTING CRIME. NOT NOT- INTERCEDING INACTIVE CRIMES THAT'S NOT OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY BUT BUT PREVENTING THEM FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE AND THAT'S A LONG TERM PROCESS. IT REQUIRES A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF ENERGY IT'S NOT JUST FROM PROBATION OFFICERS IT'S A LOT OF ENERGY FROM ALL OF OUR PARTNERS- IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE A LOT OF SERVICES TO PEOPLE FOR. DRUG TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. I WOULD SAY THE ONE OF THE FRESHER. THE I'D IS A PROBATION CHIEF IS- ASKING MY PROBATION OFFICERS TO ENSURE THE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTED RESOURCES THEY NEED ONLY TO HAVE THEM COME BACK AND SAY THOSE RESOURCES AREN'T IN OUR COMMUNITY. A LOT OF SMALLER COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE THE TYPES OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU MIGHT SEE IN- SAN RANCISCO BAY AREA LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO AND HAND AND OTHER LARGE JURISDICTIONS- SACRAMENTO IS DOING. GREAT WORK WITH LOTS OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS- THE PROBATION CHIEF THERE AND I ARE GOOD FRIENDS AND I AM JEALOUS OF SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS ACCESS TO. AND I'M ONLY TWENTY FIVE MINUTES AWAY BUT I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME TYPES OF RESOURCES. SO I'LL TELL YOU THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE OF IT IS COMMITTED RESOURCES TOWARDS. LEAN CITY IN IN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE THIS MANTRA THAT- YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE WORLD BUT WITH NO RESOURCES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT STICK AND YOU CAN HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE WORLD BUT WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM GO AND THAT THAT REALLY IS THE BASIS OF OUR WORK AT THAT THAT BALANCE OF ACCOUNTABILITY OF STRUCTURE FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD A LACK OF STRUCTURE IN THEIR LIFE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO- AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET TO THEM. AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO STAY INTACT WITH THEM OR THEY LET ALLOW THEIR ADDICTION TO INTERFERE WITH THEM CONTINUING THROUGH. ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT. MAKE THE WORK IN PROBATION SO VALUABLE IS WE CAN PROVIDE THE STRUCTURE WE CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPORT WE CAN PROVIDE THE STABILITY- UNTIL PEOPLE DEVELOP THEIR OWN. FOUR REDEVELOP THEIR OWN IN SOME CASES. AND THAT MEANS YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WELL FUNDED PROBATION DEPARTMENT THAT'S GOT PLENTY PROBATION OFFICERS THAT WERE NOT JUST PROCESSING NUMBERS BECAUSE WE GET TOO MANY CASES. BUT YOU ALSO NEED WELL FUNDED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND WELL FUNDED- SUPPORTS IN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE THERE PROVIDING RESOURCES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MY COUNTY AND I APOLOGIZE FOR GOING ON ABOUT THIS BUT MY COUNTY. MY PROBATION DEPARTMENT PROVIDES A LOT OF THOSE- INTERVENTIONS. BY PROBATION STAFF I HAVE TO HIRE THE PEOPLE TRAIN THEM AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES EITHER A CLINICALLY- OR NON CLINICALLY THROUGH MORAL RECOGNITION THERAPY IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS WERE WE TRAIN PROBATION OFFICERS TO ENGAGE WITH OUR CLIENTS. AS COUNSELORS ESSENTIALLY. AND A AND THAT'S BEEN OUR SOLUTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CEOS IN OUR JURISDICTION THE CAN DO IT SO- SO THAT'S WHAT I. WOULD SAY. AND HAVE YOU KEPT- OR DOES YOUR COUNTY KEEP STATISTICS ON CRIME RATES SINCE. HERE IS TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE OF A ROBUST. REHABILITATION PROBATION. OPERATION HAVE YOU KEPT STATISTICS ON YOUR CRIME RATES IN HOW IT'S BEEN IMPACTED YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO- I MEAN EVERY COMMUNITY KEEPS THEIR STATISTICS ON CRIME RATES BECAUSE THE REPORTER TO THE STATE AND FEDERAL DOJ- AND I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY. JUST LAST YEAR I DID A FAIRLY IN DEPTHANALYSIS BECAUSE I WAS HEARING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE WERE HERE IN THE CRIME WAS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF SPECIFICALLY PROPERTY CRIME AND I WANTED TO KNOW IF THAT WAS TRUE MY COMMUNITY SO I PULLED WERE REPORTED BY ALL THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES IN MY JURISDICTION- AND WHAT I FOUND WAS. SIMPLY NOT ACCURATE WHAT I FOUND WAS WAS TWO FOLD- THE FIRST WAS- THAT PROPERTY CRIMES- AT THERE ARE ALSO A WHOLE LOT OF PROPERTY CRIMES AND IF YOU POINT TO ONE PROPERTY CRIME IT'S UP IN ANOTHER PROPERTY CRIME IT'S DOWN THE OVER ALL HIGH IMPACT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE QUOTE WHEN THEY LOOK AT PROPERTY CRIME. SOME PROPERTYCRIME WAS UP AUTO THEFT FOR EXAMPLE AN AUTO BURGLARIES UP SIGNIFICANTLY IN MY COMMUNITY HOWEVER MOST OTHER PROPERTY CRIMES WERE DOWN WHICH LED TO AN OVERALL TREND OF REDUCED PROPERTY CRIMES IN MY COUNTY- SINCE FRANKLY REALIGNMENT AND PROP FORTY SEVEN THEY'RE JUST THERE WEREN'T SIGNIFICAN INCREASED BY PRIME ALL DOWN. NOW THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD NOTE IS WE NEED TO LOOK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE STATISTICS WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF WE'RE LOOKING AT HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES BY LOWER THAN SINCE THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AND. I WHEN YOU SEE A INCREASE IN PROPERTY. TALKING IT NEED TO LOOK AT. A FORTY YEAR TO. YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT YEAR OVER YEAR SAY WHAT THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS HIGHER THAN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WELL YEAH IT WAS THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WAS AS LOW AS NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. SO LET'S PUT IT INTO THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT OVER THE LAST. WELL GENERATION. REALLY AND WE WERE LOOKING AT HISTORICALLY LOW CRIME RATES AND I LOVE TO KEEP IN THERE. SB FANTASTIC- THE REALITY IS WE'RE GOINGTO SEE BLIPS IN CRIME RATES. IT'S A CONTINUAL DOWNWARD TREND OR STABILIZATION OF CRIME RATES WERE WHERE THEY'RE AT- BECAUSE THEY ARE AT HISTORIC LOWS ROLES CAN HAVE CRIME- BY I SUSPECT I WILL ALWAYS BE EMPLOYED- HI. BUT KEEPING THEM AT THE MODEST RATES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW IS SUPER IMPORTANT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE CONSTITUENTS OF SENATOR MORLOCKS REFERRING TO. ARE HAVING ISSUES IN THEIR- POCKET OF INTEREST. THOSE ISSUES ARE REAL- AND WE THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS THEM- FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A REFERENCE TO MY COMMENTS ABOUT HIGH RISK MISTER MINUTES. THEY ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS OR ARE HIGH RISK FOR RECIDIVISM. AGAIN THEY DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF AVAILING THEMSELVES OF PROBATION SERVICES OF THAT STRUCTURE AND THE SUPPORT AND ACCESS TO- CLINICALLY BASED SERVICES. WORTH PROVISIONS THE PATHWAY FOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE TO GET TO THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND DRUG TREATMENT AND MORE RECOGNITION THERAPY IN THOSE OTHER TYPES OF COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. WELL WE'RE THE PATHWAY TO THAT FOR IN A LOT OF INSTANCES AND MAYBE UNFORTUNATELY- BUT THE REALITY IS WE ARE. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A CERTAIN POPULATION OF HIGH RISK OFFENDERS. BECAUSE THEY KEEP BEING HIGH RISK BUT UNDER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY BUCKS- THAT THAT CAN BE A PROBLEM. AND I JUST JUST AHEAD A QUICKLY NOW. OF AND IT WAS A DISCUSSION ON PRESENTED. YES HIGH RISK MR MEANS YES AND WE- IN MY COMMITTEE LOOKED AT. CERTAIN CRIMES THAT WE POSSIBLY SHOULD LOOK AT GETTING THEIR DNA SO WE COULD TRACK THEM. WHEN LOT BUT WE DIDN'T JUST IGNORE IT BECAUSE MAYBE ONE THOSE THINGS THAT HAD SLIPPED THROUGH PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND FORTY SEVEN. THAT SOUNDS LIKE PROBABLY COULD HELP YOU. LAW ENFORCEMENT DO YOUR JOB BETTER- BUT UNFORTUNATELY- IT DIDN'T. TO DATE. THE TO SAY THEY GOT THE AUTOMATION CHANGES SAID ULTIMATELY MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR TO A SIXTY- BUT THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE. WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- POSSIBLY COULD HELP ON YOU WITH YOUR JOB DOING IT BETTER IN A WAY THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE VOTERS WANT AND WHAT THIS DOES COMMITTEE WANT. TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ANY OTHER A YES SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIRMAN- AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE EARLIER IN THE HEARING- AND THANK YOU FOR SOME OF YOUR- FINAL COMMENTS I THINK THAT SOMETIMES WE- FIVE THERE ARE CERTAIN. CHARACTERS AND PERCEPTIONS OF TAKE ON A LIFE OF THEIR OWN THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY ACCURATE I KNOW THAT EARLIER IN THE HEARING THERE WAS A I THINK AROUND SOME EXPLICIT REFERENCE MADE TO MY OWN CITY OF. SAN FRANCISCO AND THE AUTO BREAKING CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE AND I I'M I'M ASSUMING THIS CAME UP BUT IT DIDN'T. PROP 47-57 HAD NOTHING TO DO- WITH AUTO BREAK INS IT DIDN'T CHANGE- THE AUTO BREAK AND STATUTES THERE WERE NOT AUTO BREAK IN BALLOT MEASURES AND SO I THINK SOME OF THIS SORT OF GESTALT WELL THERE'S WATER BREAKING PROBLEMS IN SAN FRANCISCO NOW IN OTHER CITIES AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S BECAUSE A PROP 47-57 THAT IS. NOT ACCURATE- WE HAVE AN ORDER BREAKING PROBLEMS WERE ARE A SOME PROGRESS AND STARTING TO. STOP THE INCREASE AND EVEN SLIGHTLY START TO BRING IT DOWN TO REAL CHALLENGE AS REAL IMPACTS IN MY CITY- BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THE PROPERTY SEVEN PROP FIFTY SEVEN- AND IN SAN FRANCISCO PROPERTY CRIME HAS BEEN GOING UP FOR ABOUT A DECADE- IT STARTED BEFORE PROP FORTY SEVEN AND BEFORE. PROP FIFTY SEVEN- AND SO THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS AT PLAY AND SO WE CANCERS TIED- THE TWO TOGETHER AND THEN I ALSO- AND AGAIN I ASSUME THIS CAME UP EARLIER BUT I. AM VERY FRUSTRATING THE MAN THIS IS TRUE WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND ATTENDING A LOT OF COMMUNITY MEETINGS ABOUT WITH THE POLICE AND NOW YOU'RE UP HERE. THIS NOTION THAT BECAUSE A FELONY IS NOW A MISDEMEANOR THIS IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT AND THE POLICE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND WE HEAR THAT SOMETIMES A COMMUNITY MEETINGS. BECAUSE A PROPERTY SEVEN WE CAN ARREST PEOPLE ANYMORE BECAUSE SHOPLIFTING WAS LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WE CAN'T ARREST ANYONE ANYMORE AND THAT IS NOT ACCURATE YOU CAN ARREST SOMEONE. FOR MISDEMEANOR YOU CAN SPEND SIX MONTHS OR TWELVE MONTHS IN COUNTY JAIL ON A MISDEMEANOR- I THINK WE AS A STATE NEED TO DO BETTER AND HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MISDEMEANORS. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS MUCH BROUGHT IN THE POLICE US TO DO WITH THE COURT SYSTEM PEOPLE'S BE A CAL. FOR THE BEHAVIOR EVE IF IT IS A MISTER BUT THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN'T. ARREST OR PROSECUTE FOR MISDEMEANOR- IS JUST NOT- IS NOT ACCURATE SO I THINK WE HAVE- THEY'RE- ALWAYS TO BETTER AND I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN DO AND WE SHOULD ALWAYS BE WILLING TO TAKE A FRESH LOOK. BUT THE IDEA THAT- THESE BALLOT MEASURES HAVE SOMEHOW IN CAPACITY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE SOME THANK YOU. SO I THINK WE WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. GOOD RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION. THOSE WHO WANT TO- PLEASE START PLEASE YOU MAY BEGIN THE PERSON AT THE MY GO AHEAD. THE MORNING MY NAME IS LEAH SPELMAN I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF PARTNERSHIPS FOR TRAUMA RECOVERY A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION IN BERKELEY THAT PROVIDES MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO REFUGEES ASYLUM SEEKERS AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL SURVIVORS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. ET ARE IS ONE OF FOURTEEN TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS OR TEARS SEES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THANKS TO THE EALLOCATION OF SAVINGS FROM THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN. FOR OUR ORGANIZATION A LOAN AN END TO THIS FUNDING WOULD MEAN THAT pFAR FEWER VICTIMS OF WAR TORTURED GENDER BASED VIOLENCE AND OTHER TYPES OF PERSECUTION NOW LIVING IN THE BAY AREA WOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE THEY NEED TO HEAL. TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS LIKE P. T. R. EXISTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED CRIME VICTIMS. FOR EXAMPLE THE FLAGSHIP TEARS THE IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS INITIALLY FOUNDED TO SERVE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN ORDER FOR THESE CRIMES TO BE PROSECUTED THEY FIRST MUST BE REPORTED WHICH VICTIMS ARE OFTEN RELUCTANT TO DO BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LEVELS OF EMBARRASSMENT FEAR AND TRAUMA. MENTAL HEALTH CARE NOT ONLY SUPPORTS VICTIMS WELLBEING BUT HAS OTHER POSITIVE IMPACTS THE SAN FRANCISCO TEARS THE FOUND THAT WHEN CLIENTS RECEIVED MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT INCREASED BY FIFTY SIX PERCENT. A TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACH TO JUSTICE NOT ONLY SUPPORTS THE WELL BEING OF VICTIMS BEGIN ALSO HAVE POSITIVE WIDER RIPPLE EFFECTS. I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OUR STATE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY POLICE AND PROSECUTORS DO YOU TO ANSWER THE CALL OF DUTY EVERY DAY. I ALSO SHARE THE VALUE OF CREATING SAFER COMMUNITIES AND THE WAY TO DO THIS IS NOT TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON INCARCERATION I'M THIS DOWN OF I'M SORRY I MEAN INTERRUPT I DID NOT OPEN THIS WITH THE LIMITATIONS ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE WRAP UP AND THEN ALL INDICATE TO THE REST OF YOU. THIRTY TO FORTY FIVE SECONDS WOULD BE OPTIMAL BUT GO AHEAD AND WRAP UP SOUNDS GOOD. AND THIS DOWNSTREAM APPROACH FAILS TO ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME OR BREAK CYCLES OF VIOLENCE SEES ARE ONLY JUST BEGINNING THIS MODEL HAS BEEN EXPANDED ALREADY AND OHIO ILLINOIS IOWA NEW JERSEY AND GEORGIA. WE NEED MORE TEARS SEES BUT THIS COULD ALL BE ROLLED BACK DEPENDING ON WHAT WE DO IN THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT TO IT. HI GOOD MRNING MY NAME IS GREGORY FIDEL AND WITH INITIATE JUSTICE A PRISON POLICY ORGANIZATION THAT HAS CURRENTLY TWENTY ABOUT OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND CURRENT INCARCERATED MEMBERS AT ALL THIRTY FIVE CALIFORNIA PRISONS- I'M HERE TODAY IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS TO THIS INITIATIVE- I THINK ALL OF US KNOW ANECDOTALLY DATA AND ALSO THROUGH COMMON SENSE. THAT THESE CRIME RATES ARE GOING DOWN THINGS OF THIS NATURE. AND WE KNOW THAT CORRELATION IS NOT CAUSATION AND WE KNOW THE DATA IS SUPPORTING. NOT WITH THIS INITIATIVE IS PURPORTING TO PUT FORWARD- HIGH DOSE OF INCARCERATION ARE CREATING THESE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'RE SEEKING TO SOLVE- AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SAY VOICE A STRONG OPPOSITION- THANK YOU FOR THE TIME THANK YOU. NEXT GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S TOM OFTEN I'M A RETIRED DEPUTY CHIEF OF POLICE FOR THE CITY WAS SACRAMENTAL. THIRTY YEARS LAW ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA. TWENTY YEARS IN INGLEWOOD PT TEN IT WAS SACK AND THEN. A LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS AS A HEAD OF STATE PAROLE. THE STATE PAROLE EXPERIENCE CHANGED MY LIFE AND CHANGE THE WAY I THINK ABOUT. ESPECIALLY THE YOU GOT A UNIVERSAL UTILITY OF A REST IN OUR SOCIETY IS THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING THAT IRRITATES US AND- THAT WERE AFRAID OF. THE TRUE REALITY IS MISS ANDERSON SAID AFTER THE FACT WE ARE VERY MARGINALLY SUCCESSFUL IT TOOK. CAPTURING PEOPLE PROSECUTING THEM INCARCERATING THEM. THE RATES FOR THE CRIMES IDENTIFIED PROP FORTY SEVEN ONE LESS THAN SELL PEOPLE ON A REALITY THAT THING WE OUGHT TO BE PURSUING MOST AGGRESSIVELY. I CAN'T STRAWS ABOVE FOR STRONGLY ENOUGH THE INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- AB TEN SIXTY FIVE. I WAS HONORED I INTERVIEWED BY A LARGE- DOT NET BOB NEWS NETWORK YOUR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA A COUPLE MONTHS AGO- THE WERE OF DOG RESPONDING TO THE CALL CLAIMS BY THE LOCAL POLICE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE THEFT CRIMES HAVE GONE OFF THE MAP ESPECIALLY. FIFTHS OF A RETAIL THEFT. AND I PUT IT UP THE WITH THE TEN SIXTY FIVE WAS ON THE BOOKS TO THE GOOD WORK OF VIEW AND MANY OTHER. AND SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT NATIONAL GO BACK AND ASK YOUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOLKS HOW MANY CASES THEY'VE PRESENTED TO THEIR D. AS FELONIES FOR THE VERY THING THAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE CORPORATE COMPLIANCE ISSUES CONCERNS IN THE- THOSE OPPOSE SUPPORT THIS INITIATIVE. SHE THEN WENT TO ALL SEVEN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SHE'S ON FIVE CASES HAVE BEEN FILED IN THAT. AB TO ATTEND SIXTY FIVE SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND AN ACTING IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. LASTLY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RESPOND TO NON VIOLENT CRIME HAS BEEN A HANDICAP FOR FORTY YEARS I PORTS PERSONALLY KNOW OF. I THINK WE OFTEN AS A SOCIETY AND POLITICIANS AND OTHERS. ARE FOCUSED ON THE END ALL RESULT HAS GOT TO BE A REST HAS GOT TO BE INCARCERATION THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET THOSE GET TO WEAR IT MAKES ANY SENSE. THAT SIMPLE IS IT DOESN'T HOLD TRUE WITH THE FAX THE ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RESPONDED NONVIOLENT CRIMES AND JUST ASK YOUR CHIEF LET ME SEE YOUR CALL MANAGEMENT ROVERS PROP POLICY STATEMENT. THEIR WAY LOW ON THE PRIORITY LIST BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE BECAUSE WE NEED TO DEFAULT FOR VIOLENT AND DANGEROUS CRIME FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SYSTEM. THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE TODAY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT ISN'T THAT DO YOU KNOW JESUS WOULD JUST THROW MORE PORTAL IN PRISON AND WE COULD JUST RUSTOM BETTER WOULD ALL BE FINE NO THE WHOLE DOGGONE SYSTEM IS MOTHER TO DIS FUNCTIONALITY. THE END RESULT THIS IS WHAT MY PAROLE EXPERTS STRUCK ME THE END RESULT THE PEOPLE THAT WE PUT IN OUR JAILS AND PRISONS AND WE PUT OUT EUROPE ROLAND AND PROVISIONS. THAT'S A SYMPTOM NOT THE BECAUSE YOU WANT YOUR POLICE IS TO BUILD A GOLD OF BOB PRIORITY CALLS YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PUT A WHOLE LOT MORE THEM ON THE STREET I WAS THE CHIEF. YOU MIGHT HAVE EIGHT OR NINE PEOPLE OUT THERE ON ON THE IN THE MIDDLE AND I DO PUT THEM GOING TO. ROUSE BECAUSE SOMEONE STOLE BALONEY ONE OF THEM READY TO GO TO A VIOLENT CRIME OR PEOPLE ARE INJURED IF YOU COULD ROUTE PATTERSON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. FIVE WE- APPRECIATE TEST I'D WANT TO PEOPLE OFF I WOULD APPRECIATE BEING AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I REPRESENT TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING BRIEFLY FOR EACH OF THEM MY NAME'S GOING BACK AS AN ON BEHALF OF DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE WHO OPPOSES THIS INITIATIVE WILL POINT OUT THAT COLLECTING THE DNA FROM DRUG USERS SIMPLE DRUG POSSESSION OFFENDERS IS A HUGE WASTE OF RESOURCES. IT'S CROWDING THE WOOD CROWDER OUR SYSTEM FOR TESTING FOR RAPE KITS AND OTHER EVIDENCE ALSO WITH A HUGE. AND RACIALLY BIASED POLICY OF COLLECTION OF PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION FROM CITIZENS. DRUG OFFENDERS OVERWHELMING WHO ARRESTED ARE BLACK AND LATINO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THEIR MEDICAL INFORMATION THEIR MOST PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION IT'S NOT JUST THE OFFENDER IS THEIR KIDS IT'S THEIR PARENTS IT'S THERE BECAUSE IN ITS ENTIRE FAMILY TREES PRIVATE MEDICAL INFORMATION AND PUT IN A SO CALLED SECURE DATABASE. THAT'S NOT SAFE IT'S NOT FAIR IT'S NOT RIGHT. ALSO IN TERMS OF. INVESTMENT IN DRUG TREATMENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES IS ABYSMAL. WE APPRECIATE THE SMALL ROLE THAT PROBATION PLAYS ON THE COURTS PLAY AN IDENTIFYING PEOPLE IN THE TREATMENT. BUT THE MAJORITY DRUG USERS DO NOT COMMIT PROPERTY CRIME A VIOLENT CRIME. AND MAJORITY OF FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION ISSUES ARE NOT ARE CRUEL JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY NEED ACCESS TREATMENT ON DEMAND. CALIFORNIA UNITED HAVE NEVER INVESTED IN TREATMENT ON DEMAND. BUT WE INVEST IN COURT DIVERSION. LONG FOR THE DURATION IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE THAN LETTING PEOPLE VOLUNTEER THEMSELVES TO GET BETTER. ON BEHALF OF ELEVATOR CENTER I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT ADDRESS THE MYTH THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOING TOO FAR TOO FAST. CALIFORNIA WITH FORTY MILLION CITIZENS IF IT WERE STANDALONE COUNTRY WOULD BE AMONGST MOST INCARCERATED IN THE WORLD. COMPARABLE WITH RUSSIA AND BELARUS. OUR INCARCERATION RATE IS THREE TIMES THAT OF CANADA. AND FIVE TIMES OUT OF ANY NORTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRY. AND NOT BECAUSE NORTHERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DON'T HAVE CAR BREAK INS OR SHOPLIFTING OR BURGLARY OR DRINKS. THEY DON'T OVER PUNCH THEY DON'T KEEP PEOPLE FOR RIDICULOUSLY LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THEY INVEST IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND COMMUNITIES THEY INVEST IN JOB CREATION AND THAT'S THE PATH TO SAFER COMMUNITIES THANK YOU THANK YOU.
