THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE STAFF- FOR THE TIME ALL THE TIME THAT'S BEEN GIVEN- ON TO SB NINE- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY FOR OVER A YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER GOT TO BE YOU AND I HAVE ENGAGE WITH RESIDENTS RENTING RENT APARTMENTS AND HOMES FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CALLED ALSO DENTAL. THEN THIS IS THE STATE ROUTE SEVEN TEN CORRIDOR. MY STAFF AND I HAVE GONE DOOR TO DOOR TO HEAR THE CONCERNS WE'VE TALKED TO HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS. LAST YEAR SINCE LAST YEAR WE HAVE ENGAGED ALSO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND CAL TRANS TO URGE FAIR TREATMENT OF THESE TENANTS AND EXPEDITE THE SALE OF THESE PROPERTIES AT AFFORDABLE HOUSING RATES. INCLUDING CURRENT TENANT OCCUPIED AND VACANT PROPERTIES AND LOTS. SB NINE WILL ALLOW FOR THE SALE OF CALTRANS PROPERTIES TO QUALIFIED HOUSING RELATED ENTITIES SUCH AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NONPROFIT HOUSING EIGHT EIGHT ENTITIES. AT THE AGENCIES ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE. IN EXCHANGE FOR A GUARANTEE OF PROVIDING FIFTY FIVE YEARS OF AFFORDABLE AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING THAT'S THE RULE THAT WE WERE ASKING TO BE CHANGED. SB NINE ALLOWS AN H. R. E. TO BUY THE PROPERTY AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR FIXING THEM UP AND KEEPING THEM AFFORDABLE. SEVENTY YEARS AGO THROUGH EMINENT DOMAIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEGAN DISPLACING FAMILIES AND ALTERED THE COMMUNITY OF EL SAID ANIL FOR A PROPOSED FREEWAY EXPANSION. CALTRANS BOUGHT PROPERTIES. HUNDREDS OF PROPERTIES WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE FAMILIES IN THE QUARTER DISRUPTED THE ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FABRIC OF THIS PREDOMINANTLY LATINO COMMUNITY. THEN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE DECLARED THERE WOULD BE NO EXTENSION FOR INTERSTATE SEVEN TEN. AS THE FUTURE OF SEVEN TEN HAS BEEN DECIDED L. SO DENTAL HAS AGAIN BEEN ACUTELY IMPACTED. BY MANY MANY PROBLEMS WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED HOMES CURRENTLY VACANT NEARLY HALF THE CALTRANS HOMES ARE IN EL SAID ANIL IN MANY IN POOR CONDITION WE NOW HAVE A NEW OPPORTUNITY. TO REPAIR AND IMPROVE THE HOUSING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND AT THE SAME TIME INCREASE LONG TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING- NOT. ONLY FOR LOS ANGELES BUT FOR THE STATE. THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX RESIDENTIAL RENTERS AND THIS ALL IN THIS PORTION OF THE QUARTER. NOT ONLY IS THIS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY IT'S ALSO FISCALLY PRUDENT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO FIX THE HOMES IN ORDER TO SELL THEM. SINCE MOST OF THESE HOMES WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR HABITABILITY STANDARDS WE WANT TO PROVIDE REPAIR THESE HOMES MAKE THEM RESPECTABLE DIGNIFIED LIVING SPACES WHILE EXPANDING LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY. MY BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE RULES OR GIVE ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT TO PEOPLE WHO MAKE. 121% ABOVE THE COUNTY MEDIAN INCOME. AND THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED ORDER PRIORITY TO SELL THESE PROPERTIES THAT IS NOT CHANGING. CALTRANS CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE TENANTS IN THIS QUARTER PARTICIPATING IN AN AFFORDABLE RENT PROGRAM. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR US THIS YEAR AND EVERY YEAR UNTIL WE AND THE CRISIS IT IS CRITICAL WE PURSUE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE AND EXPAND AFFORDABLE OPTIONS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO MOBILE OWNERSHIP AWAY FROM CALTRANS SECURE LONG TERM AFFORDABILITY AND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE UNITS WHILE MAKING SURE THAT CURRENT TO CALTRANS TENANTS ARE PROTECTED BY RULES ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING. RESIDENTS RENTING APARTMENTS AND HOMES DESERVE FAIR TREATMENT AND TO BE STABLE. THEY WILL NOW HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IT'S BEEN NINE IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THAT LONG TERM SOLUTION FOCUSING ON THE PRIMARY GOAL. EXPANDING AND PRESERVING AFFORDABILITY FOR THESE PROPERTIES FOR PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF TENANTS. COLLEAGUES TODAY WE HAVETWO EXPERTS ON THE PHONE NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER BE A THREE STOPS HER FROM NEW ECONOMICS FOR WOMEN AS WELL AS JENNY SCANLON CHIEF DEVELOPMENT OFFICER WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HOUSING AUTHORITY.

THIS IS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY WHICH GIVE EVERYBODY RIGHT I THINK THE THING TENANTS INTACT. AND ALLOWS FOR NATURAL MIX AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP AND RENTAL HOUSING.

LOW INCOME RESIDENTS- THE WORKING POOR FORMALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE LOW INCOME SENIORS. EMANCIPATED FOSTER YOUTH AND SO ON AND SO FORTH WE KNOW WE HAVE. A PROFOUND SHORTAGE OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY A PROFOUND SHORTAGE OF HOUSING. THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO OUR LOWEST INCOME. RESIDENTS ARE WE SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS EVERY DAY WE SEE IT WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEPLY STRUGGLING WITH OUR HOUSING. BUT WE ALSO SEE A WITH THE EXPLOSION. OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR STATE- THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. LIVING FULL TIME IN THEIR CARS. PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING IN HOMELESS SHELTERS. ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN PARKS AND ON OUR STREETS. CALIFORNIA COMPRISES APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN PERCENT. OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT COMPRISES 25% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE NATION'S. I SHELTERED HOMELESS THIS IS A MORAL ABOMINATION. AND WE HAVE A DUTY TO ADDRESS IT AND THERE MANY MANY THINGS WE NEED TO DO TO FIX OUR HELPING TO BUCKLE. AND ONE OF THEM IS AGGRESSIVELY BUILDING HOUSING FOR OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS. AND WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THIS BILL TO MOVE THE DIAL. AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN THIS BILL HAS A HUGE. AFFORDABLE HOUSING COALITION BEHIND IT IS SPONSORED. BY THE TWO LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING COALITIONS. AND THE STATE OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION A NONPROFIT HOUSING AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION AND WHAT THE BILL WILL DO IS IT WILL ALLOW CHURCHES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS NONPROFITS AS WELL AS NONPROFIT COLLEGES. TO TAKE THEIR ACCESS LANDS AND TO TURN IT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER IN THE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE DEED RESTRICTED BELOW MARKET RATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

PARKING WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE THIS BILL PAIRS WHAT A BILLABLE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS BUT THE ASSEMBLY PASSED AND SO THIS CAN REALLY HELP US THE DIAL. THE BILL WILL ALLOW FOR THE AND APPROVE THE BUYER APPROVAL OF THE IS A 100% AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT MEET CERTAIN SPECIFIC CRITERIA THERE ARE LIMITS ON HEIGHTS IT OFTEN DIFFERS THE LOCAL HIGH LIMIT IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS ARE LOCAL HERE A PLUS WINE AND COMMERCIAL MIXED USE AREAS.

IT FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH. THE CALL WE ARE TO DECRY. AND THIS BILL IS PART OF THE SO. I DO WANNA- TO A KNOWLEDGE- DYNAMIC AROUND THIS BILL AND THAT IS THAT I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR THIS TODAY.

YES I APPRECIATE THE THIS BILL AS WAS NOTED WE ARE IN AN EIGHT EXCLUSION REGARDING HOUSING WE HAVE TO DO- MORE. QUICKLY AGGRESSIVELY AND WE HAVE TO BUILD. THAT WE CAN ON POTENTIALLY USE LAND THAT HAS NOT BEEN USED BEFORE TO BUILD IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I THINK VERY INNOVATIVE. HOWEVER I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT REALLY URGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES TO BUT THE SKILLED LANGUAGE UP. IN THIS BILL- BECAUSE IF IT DOES COME BACK TO THE FLOOR OF WITHOUT WORKING OUT WITH THE TRADES I CANNOT PROMISE I WOULD SUPPORT IT THERE. BUT I'D ALSO URGE OUR FRIENDS ON BOTH SIDES THE OPPOSING SIDE AND THE SUPPORTING SIDE TO KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE AND LOOK FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. IN ORDER. TO GET BUILDING DONE FOR THESE HOW NOW WILL CONTINUE TAKING. AND THAT MEANS PEOPLE SLEEPING ON CORNERS THAT MEANS PEOPLE SLEEPING IN CARS THAT MEANS PEOPLE AND PARKS AND IT MEANS AN ADDITIONAL ONLY A THREAD OF A COVERT VIRUS EXPLODING AS WE SEE THAT AS PEOPLE ARE OUT ON THE STREETS THAT NO SANITARY PLACE FOR THEM. TO USE ARRAY. RESTROOM IN ADDITION TO CHANGE HANDS ANY NOW. SO THAT IMPERATIVE THE WE GET OF. THE TOP RIGHT NOW I KNOW. THAT TO. CORD WE WANT EVERY EGGS THE WAY WE WILL IT BUT HAVE TO COME TO THE- MAKES AMONG. THAT ARE LOOKING AT A PANDEMIC PERIOD THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU MR GRUBER. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND NOT REALLY ENCOURAGED BY WHAT YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING ABOUT YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES- YOU KNOW REALLY HOPE THAT THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE AT THIS TO ME IS THE KIND OF THOUGHTFUL AND INNOVATIVE POLICY THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS ND HOPEFUL THAT THE THAT THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT EVERYBODY CAN GET BEHIND AND SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS IS THE THESE ARE THE KIND OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE NEED. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT TO ADD A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE HERE IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR ONE OF THE CALL ONE OF THE- THE WITNESSES I GUESS MENTION THE EDITORIAL IN THE IN THE LA TIMES ABOUT THE BILL ENDORSING THE BILL. I'M NOT IT OPENS BY TALKING ABOUT THE VISION OF MY RABBI- IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND SEE AND MY DOG IN ENCINO VALLEY BACHELOR WHERE I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A MEMBER THE COMMUNITY OR MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND IT'S A PLACE THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO MY FAMILY ME. AND OUR COMMUNITY. LIKE MANY OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES IN THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ACROSS THE STATE. HAS TALKED IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT HOW WE CAN. HELP TO ADDRESS OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE'VE SEEN. A BIG INCREASE IN THE WEST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEIR FAITH COMMUNITIES OF EVERY DENOMINATION THAT WANT TO LIVE OUT THEIR VALUES. NEVER WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE. THEY WANT TO HELP OUR HOMELESS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. AND SO ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT WAS PROPOSED. WAS BUILDING SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOVE OUR PARKING LOT. AS A WAY TO HELP FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO THE RABBI TALKS ABOUT HIS VISION FOR BUILDING NOT. ABOUT HOW WOULD ALLOW- KIDS LIKE MINE. WHO ARE AT THE PRESCHOOL THERE TO INTERACT WITH FOLKS OF AN OLDER GENERATION TO HELP KEEP. SENIORS OFF THE STREETS WE SAW IN THE MOST RECENT HOMES COUNT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT. FOLKS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK FROM HOMELESSNESS. SO THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT I THINK CAN REALLY BRING. BENEFITS TO OUR TO OUR COMMUNITY. AND ALLOW FAITH COMMUNITIES TO DO WHAT THEY VIEW AS AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF THEIR MISSION AND THEIR WORK. AND I WILL JUST NOTE FOR SOME OF THE CALLERS TO MENTION THAT. YOU KNOW FOLKS IN NEIGHBORHOODS ARE OPPOSED TO THOSE FOLKS WHO LIVE NEAR THESE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS ACTION TO REALLY. LIGHTNING CONVERSATION THIS WEEKEND WITH SOME CONSTITUENTS OF MINE WHO LIVE ON GLORIA AVENUE NEEDS. NO LITERALLY ARE. THE CORNER FROM WHERE THE SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHEN WE- LIT LITERALLY WITH. HUNDREDS HUNDRED FEET AWAY. AND THEIR THEIR YOUNG FAMILY TO. TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS. AND SO I TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS PROJECT IN ABOUT THIS BILL TO SEE WHAT THEIR REACTIONS MIGHT BE. AND THEY WERE SO ENTHUSIASTIC. THEY THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS BE A BEAUTIFUL THING FOR OUR COMMUNITY. A WONDERFUL THING AND REALLY ENCOURAGED AND SO I THINK THAT. THERE MAY BE. YOU KNOW COLORS FROM AROUND THE STATE WHO WHO ARE CALLING AND PURPORTING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF. COMMUNITIES ARE NEIGHBORHOODS. BUT THEY ACTUALLY DON'T RELECT THE MAJORITY OPINION IN. HIS NEIGHBOR. SO I THINK THAT. WHY THIS BILL SO. OUT OF THE- WITH. WITH NINE. VOTES I KNOW WHETHER SUCH POTS OF. ME DOWN. WERE TOGETHER. REALLY HOPE YOU'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE TRADES AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS WANT TO THOSE. CONVERSATIONS IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT I THINK WE CAN. SEND HOPEFULLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK GET SIGNED INTO. LAW TO DEMONSTRATE THE P. ABOVE ALL FACE AND BACK. AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WANT TO COME TOGETHER AND WANT TO BE PART OF SOLVING OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR TO FUNDING FOR THE BILL TODAY. AND THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORWARD. MR BONTA. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR ABOUT BRINGING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT BILL FORWARD AYE I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY CREATIVE- AND INNOVATIVE AND THOUGHTFUL AND ITS APPROACH AND- THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IT PROVIDED SOME OF ON LOCKING TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ABOUT THE STATE IS INCREDIBLE IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE TREAT. OUR WORKERS TO BUILD OUR HOUSING- IN THE WAY THAT THEY DESERVE I PROVIDE THE SUPPORT AND I'M I'M THANKFUL FOR YOUR ON GOING COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE BUILDING TRADES THAT DISCUSS YOU'VE HAD THE ONES I KNOW YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE TO TRY TO ARRIVE AT A WHAT I HOPE WILL BE- A MUTUALLY AGREEABLE SOLUTION ON ON THE- SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE COMPONENTS SO- I KNOW THAT'S NOT EASY I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED WITH THEM IN THE PAST EXCESSIVELY ON VERY IMPORTANT HOUSING BILLS WELL WITH YOUR KNOWN TO OFF THEIR CHAMPION. AND I HOPE YOU CAN A CALL IS THAT IT IN HERE SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I PLAN TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. AKON IS THERE A MOTION WITH THE BILL FOR. THE SECOND. GREAT I JUST ALSO WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR COMMITTEE AND FOR NOT WORKING OUT- QUITE A FEW MOMENTS FOR THIS BILL AND ALSO WERE JUST ECHO ARE COLLEAGUES COMMENTS ABOUT REPORTS OF THIS IDEA OBVIOUSLY WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS INTERSTATES HISTORY BUT PART OF WHAT I APPRECIATE ABOUT THIS BILL. ARE THE FIVE PAGES OF SUPPORT FROM THE FAITH COMMUNITY- WHO VALUES ARE ABOUT HELPING THOSE WHO ARE IN INCREASE ANTICIPATED THIS TIME AND APPRECIATE THE FAITH COMMUNITIES KEEP PARTNERSHIP ON HOUSING AND- WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD A CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE BILL THAT HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH FAITH LEADERS OVER THE YEARS ABOUT HOW CHALLENGING IT IS BANNED TO. WORK ON THEIR OWN PROPERTIES TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT A MENTION TWO ASPECTS OF THE BILL I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION AROUND THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION A MOMENT THAT WAS ACCEPTED I UNDERSTAND THE SENATE OF THE WORKING GROUP ON THIS HAS A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS COMMITTEE ALSO HAS A PERSPECTIVE AND UP- THIS COMMITTEE- WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS AMENDMENT- THE BILL WITH THIS COMMENT SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. WITH REGARD THAT COMES WITH THE TWO THE OF ALL OF OUR CALL SO APPRECIATE THE- MANY CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING. BETWEEN THE AUTHOR. AND STAKEHOLDERS THIS BILL AND THE BUILDING TRADES I TINK WE ALL WOULD. LIKE TO SEE A GOOD RESOLUTION IN THIS BILL. OF JUST REITERATE FOR THE PUBLIC. THIS BILL WILL NEXT BE GOING TO THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WHERE IT STILL CAN BE AMENDED IN TIME FOR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL- BEFORE THE END OF SESSION SO. WITH THAT TO LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION AND HOPE IT IS PRODUCTIVE. I'LL JUST REITERATE. HI EVERYONE ON ALL SIDES OF THIS ISSUE I KNOW- HAVE THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC IN MIND AND- OUR HOPE IS SET- WE CAN WORK THROUGH THESE ISSUES AND- AND GET THERE. SO WITH THAT. UNLESS ARE ANY FINAL COMMENTS HELD HER BACK TO THE SENATOR FOR HIS FINAL CLOSING REMARKS. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA COLLEAGUES EVERYONE THANK YOU FOR THOSE VERY THOUGHTFUL- REMARKS AND THIS- AS A AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. I GET REAL MENTION THIS IS ONE OF THOSE. IN MANY WAYS- SORT OF.MOM AND- HI. I'VE KIND OF BILLS AT THE NOT A THIRTY NOT NOTHING BUT BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO BE NOTICED SOME OF THE SUPPORT COMMENTS ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS THAT DON'T TYPICALLY SUPPORT HIGH HOUSING BILLS THAT I AUTHOR- THERE IS ENORMOUSLY BROAD AND DEEP SUPPORT FOR THIS APPROACH IT'S ONE OF THOSE IDEAS AS THE CHAIR JUST MENTION WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A LONG TIME OF AND SAYING WHY AREN'T WE MAKING THIS EASIER THIS BILL. WILL MAKE IT MUCH MUCH EASIER- HIGH- YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU KNOW I THINK BY FOR ALL OF US BUT PARTICULARLY FOR ME GIVEN MY HISTORY OF THE TRADES NEVER COMFORTABLE TO SIT HERE AS YOU KNOW FOLKS I'VE ALWAYS- VIEWS STRONG ALLIES ARE CLOSING YOUR BILL- AS I MENTIONED WE ARE. SIT DOWN THE COMMERCE ITH A MISS HUNTER WE'RE GONNA COULD OUR TO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER IN ALL. ALL PARTIES TO COME UP WITH THE REST. IS COMP. WE HAVE SPONSORS ON THIS BILL WHO HAVE THEIR OWN OPINIONS- AND YOU KNOW IT I VERY VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE GET IT DONE I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO GET IT DONE SO WE'RE BUILDING HOUSING. HAVING MIDDLE CLASS- CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. AND I TAKING THAT ALREADY EXTREMELY ROBUST APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. AND MAKING IT EVEN BIGGER. WE HAVE SUCH A NEED FOR HOUSING WE WANT A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION TO HAPPEN IN THE STATE. OF HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND WE DO THAT. BY PARTNERING WITH THE HOUSE OF LABOR SO COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY.

WITH THAT YOU HAVE A SECOND BILL 2% OF FALLEN FIVE SB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT SENATE OWNER. I THINK I CAN SAFELY PROMISE OF THIS WILL BE A MUCH OF THE BILL ARE GOING. HI SO I COLLEAGUES SIZE SB ELEVEN THIRTY EIGHT- MAKES- CLARIFYING CHANGES AND CLOSES LOOPHOLES- AND HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. RELATING TO TWO THINGS FIRST A LONG STANDING HOUSING ELEMENT LAW HAS REQUIRED. THAT WHEN A CITY ADOPTS A HOUSING ELEMENT- HAS TO DESIGNATE A ZONE IN THE CITY. FOR BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF HOMELESS SHELTERS- AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT AS WE KNOW I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE AND- LEFT WING SAN FRANCISCO OR RIGHT WING. SOMEWHERE ELSE- PEOPLE TEND TO PUSH BACK WHEN YOU TRY TO PUT HOMELESS SERVICES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- ANSWER GOVERNOR BEHALF AT W. O. MAY I RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE THE BILL- FIRST AND FOREMOST WE ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT STATEMENT IN THE END I. THE BAY SO. WHY ARE WE DEALING WITH THIS OP GLOBAL ISSUE WITH ALL RENTERS MOBILE HOME RENTERS ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN APARTMENT RENTERS RESIDENTIAL RENTERS. EVERYBODY DESERVES THE SAME PROTECTIONS AND WHY SHOULD WE BE DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES SEPARATELY AND THERE'S TWO BIG REASONS WHY. THAT IT'S A PROBLEM NO ONE ON THE AND SAFETY ISSUE. WELL THE FIREFIGHTERS LOCALLY MAY FEEL LIKE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE DRESS THEIR CONCERNS. EVERY HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS AT A MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER YES BY SHEER DEFINITION IS HELPING SAY I HAVE A- THIS BILL BASICALLY SET. PARK HONOR YOUR PICK AND CHOOSE BETWEEN WHAT ONES WILL BE A ONE YOUR FORGIVENESS AND WHAT. AND SAFE TELL US WE WILL TAKE. COURTS WE CAN ADJUDICATE WHICH ONES ARE LIFE AND THREATENED AND TELL US WHICH ONES DESERVE A YEAR. BUT AS WRITTEN WE HAVE TO TAKE EVERY SINGLE HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATION TO COURT AND THE JUDGES WILL HAVE TO DECIDE BECAUSE IF WE DON'T TAKE ONE VIOLATION TO COURT. AND THAT WAS AND SOMETHING. THAT WORKING BE LIABLE. SO WE BELIEVE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED WE BELIEVE IT'S A CHIP WOULD BE REMOVED. NUMBER TWO. THIS BILL SAYS NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO. FOLLOW THE RENT CHARGES PER YEAR AND- LEVINSON LABELS RIGHT IT IS NOT A FORGIVENESS. BUT THEY THEN TO ADD ON UTILITY STATE CHARGES LIKE STATE INSPECTION FEES. WIRE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS BEING ASKED IF YOU. ARE SIMPLY THE BED. OF RIGHT OF COLLECT RENT IN MAINE A PAR. IF WE DON'T GET OUR RENT THAT'S ONE THING. BUT NOT GETTING UTILITIES AND STATE CHARGES JUST ADDS INSULT TO INJURY. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. TO THE MODERATOR IF YOU COULD ALLOW JASON OCCURRED TO TESTIFY. I NO LONGER DARKER ON THE PHONE. OKAY LET US MOVE AT THIS MOMENT UNLESS MISTER REICHARDT COMES BACK TO OTHER MEMBERS OF PUBLIC TO WISH TO OPPOSE THE BILL.

I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT ALL HOMEOWNERS TO LOSE THEIR HOME DURING. THIS COVERED CRISIS DUE TO ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE GENERALLY COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT UNLIKE TRADITIONAL. RESIDENTIAL RENTERS THESE MOBILE HOMEOWNERS WHO MISTER RENT PAYMENT. COULD STAND TO LOSE NOT ONLY THEIR SHELTER BUT THERE INVESTMENT IN THEIR HOME- THE ONLY THING I'LL SAY IS I WILL REITERATE- THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAD OUR COMMITTEE NOW SAYS THAT IT'S- MY HOPE THAT AS- A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT.

A LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS WILL TURN BACK OVER TO THE CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OPPOSITION AND I DO HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS FUNDAMENTALLY ON WHAT THIS BILL DOES. NOT JUST. SAY THAT- UTILITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A PASSED THROUGH. BUT AS THE CHAIR OF THE. HEY MISTER CHAIR YOU MADE MY POINT FOR ME EXACTLY MOBILE HOME OWNERS FACE SIGNIFICANT LOSS WHEN THEY'RE EVICTED FROM THEIR MOBILE HOME PARK. UNLIKE APARTMENT TENANTS MOBILE HOME OWNERS OWN THEIR HOME AND IS IT LIKELY ARE SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR NEST EGG. COUNTRY TO POPULAR BELIEF MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT EASILY MOBILE. SO IF THEY'RE EVICTED THE RESIDENT WOULD LOSE THEIR LARGEST ASSET WHICH IN SOME CASES. PRESENTS THEIR LIFE SAVINGS. TO THE LANDLORD. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. COLLEGES ARE MOTION OF THIS BEFORE BECAUSE MOTION AND IF THERE'S A SECOND TWO IT MADAM SECRETARY. PLEASE COLOR. DO YOU THE MOTION IS TO PASS TWO FIVE Q. I DEEP. DEEP NOT VOTING GABRIEL. GLORIA KILEY. KILEY NO LIMON. BONTA BONTA AYE AYE QUIRK SILVA SIX OF AYE WE WILL WAIT FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ENRON THANK YOU SENATOR CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS WILL NOW GO TO FILE AND SEVEN SB NINE NINE NINE SENATOR ON BURKE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READING THIS YEAR PLEASE ENTER SORRY THANK YOU OF MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THANK THE UP TO THE PRESENT SB NINE NINE NINE IN A PARTICULAR THANK YOU TO YOUR STAFF MISTER CHAIR FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT IT IT'S SIMPLY. RESOLVES A SITUATION THAT IS BOTH ANOMALOUS AND INEQUITABLE AS IT RELATES TO MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS SO LET ME ILLUSTRATE HOW THIS. WORKS RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW. YOU HAVE SAY TWO DIFFERENT UNITS YOU'VE GOT A MOBILE HOME. IN A HUNDRED METERS AWAY OF A TWO MILLION DOLLAR HOUSE. IF THERE'S A LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE AND THE MOBILE HOME OWNER HAS A LEASE MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS WHICH IS QUITE COMMON. AND THERE'S A RENT CONTROL AN INSTANCE IN AFFECTED THAT LOCALITY. THE TWO MILLION DOLLAR. HOME TENANT. CAN AVAIL HIMSELF OR HERSELF OF THE PROTECTIONS OF THE LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE WHERE IS THE PERSON LIVES IN THE SENIOR PARK A HUNDRED METERS AWAY HAS NO SUCH PROTECTIONS. AND THIS IS THE RESULT. OF WHAT WHAT I WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS AN ANOMALY IN THE LAW. THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU ARE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK AND YOU HAVE A LEAST ONE IN TWELVE MONTHS. YOU CAN'T AVAIL YOURSELF OF THE PROTECTIONS OF ANY RENT STABILIZATION A RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE. IN THE AREA. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SIMPLY SAYS LOOK AT. ARE THE LAW WILL BE APPLIED EQUALLY. IT MEANS THAT THE LOCALITY THEN CONTROLS WHETHER OR NOT GOING TO BE RENT STABILIZATION FOR CONTROL. NOT IMPOSE STATEWIDE RENT CONTROL ARM AND THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE IS THE BENEFITS OF THAT BUT WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT RETURNS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY THE ABILITY TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. NOW WHILE THE OPPONENTS ARE GONNA TESTIFY THAT THIS BILL SOMEHOW. ELIMINATES LONG TERM LEASES THEN I WOULD INVITE THE COMMITTEE TO ASK THE QUESTION WHERE IN THE BILL DOES IT. ELIMINATE TERM LEASES IT DOES NOT IN IN FACT IF THERE'S AN ISSUE IF THERE IS A CONCERN IF THERE IS ABOUT WILL BE HAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE LONG TERM LEASES. NOW WHAT IT DOES DO IS THAT. IF THERE IS A LONG TERM LEASE. AND RENT CONTROL COMES IN BEING IN THAT LOCALITY. THEN THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THAT PROTECTION IT ALSO GRANDFATHERS IN LONG TERM LEASES. UP THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO IN THE EXAMPLE I GAVE AT THE OUTSET IF YOU'RE IN A MOBILE HOME PARK AND YOU'VE GOT A LONG TERM LEASE THAT YOU'VE SIGNED BEFORE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL. YOU'RE GONNA BE BOUND BY THE- AGAIN IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE LONG TERM LEASES NOW. IF YOU'VE GOT A LONG TERM LEASE THAT SAY FOR EXAMPLE. THE 20% ANNUAL. ARE INCREASE OR FROM IN. THEN IF UP. IF THERE'S PASSAGE OF A LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE YES THAT THE- A PROVISIONS ARE OF LOCAL ORDINANCE IT'S SIMPLY AGAIN A MATTER OF EQUITY. IN A MATTER OF REMOVING THIS AMOUNT IN STATE LAW. I WOULD URGE ARRIVAL. THANK YOU LET'S GO TO YOUR WITNESSES AND SUPPORT- LET'S FIRST GO TO LINDA NINE. HI MY NAME IS LINDA PRESIDENT OF THE AT THE LOWER IN COURT AGAINST HE NINE NINETEEN.

WHAT THEY NEED TO LOCAL COULD. LOCAL GOVERNMENT DID YOU WHAT THEY CAN'T FOR SENIOR VETERANS AND IMMIGRANTS LIKE. AND THEY DO WHAT THEY SAY IT MEANS NOTHING. MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS LEASE THE LAND UNDERNEATH THE HOME OF THE WEOWN. HOWEVER A MOBILE HOME LATE THAT A TWELVE MONTH PLUS ONE DAY IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR FLIGHT THAT.

AND THE CHAIR AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. SAID I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR TO ADDRESS- THE CHALLENGES THAT I KNOW. ABOUT FOLKS HAVE HAD AROUND THE CIRCUMVENTION OF LOCAL RENT CONTROL ORDINANCES BY USING MULTI YEAR LEASES. ARE WE ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE STATE'S ROLE AND HOW- WE MAY IMPACT LOCAL RENT STABILITY POLICIES. IN THIS YEAR DOES SEEM IT IN THIS CASE IT DOES SEEM THAT THE- MULTI YEAR LEASE EXEMPTION HAS APPEARED TO BE A BARRIER. OFFER SOME LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE SEEKING TO PROTECT THE FOR ABILITY SO WITH THAT. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE ANY FINAL COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LET ME JUST ADDRESS SEVERAL CONCERNS THE RACE- FIRST. OKAY THREE CAN FOR EXAMPLE IF. A RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE CANDACE GLUED MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS THAT ORDINANCE CAN SPECIFICALLY SAY WE WILL ONLY PROVIDE PROTECTION TO THOSE AND STICK BUILT HOUSING. WE WILL EXCLUDE THOSE IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE THAT NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IN TERMS OF VACANCY CONTROL OR D. CONTROL. THE BILL DOES NOT SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE. A LOCALITY CAN IN ENACTING ITS ORDINANCE OR MODIFYING ITS ORDINANCE. ARE ENACT A PROVISION THAT YOU'D PROVIDES FOR VACANCY CONTROL OR VACANCY DEEP CONTROL IT'S LEFT UP TO THE LOCALITY- IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY PROTECTIONS THE BILL IS. URGE MEMBERS ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT THIS BILL DOES THERE ARE. TO SEE. WE ARE TO LA THE IN IN THE ANOMALY IS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN STATE. THAT PREVENTS THOSE IN MOBILE HOMES FROM BEING PROTECTED- IF THERE'S A RENT CONTROL ORDINANCE THAT'S AN EFFECT WITH THAT ORIGINAL VOTE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES IS OUR MOTION OF THIS FOR. AS OUR SECOND. A SECOND. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS A MAN AMENDED Q. HI CHU I DEEP. DEEP NOT VOTING GABRIEL. ZERO NOT VOTING GLORIA KILEY KILEY NO LIMON BONTA BONTA AYE QUIRK SILVA OKAY QUIRK SILVA NOT VOTING. WE'LL KEEP THIS ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SIR. LET'S PROCEED TO FILE ITEM NINE SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YES BE TEN EIGHTY FIVE. ITS PURPOSE IS TO HELP IMPROVE THE DENSITY BONUS LAW THAT THE STATE HAS SO THERE WE ACTUALLY GET MORE UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT A LAW THAT WAS PASSED IN I BELIEVE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. TO BASICALLY INCENTIVIZE. BUILDERS OF MARKET RATE UNITS TO INCLUDE IN THEIR PROJECTS AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS IN ALL THE TIME THAT WE HAD THAT ONE PLACE. LESS THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE APPROVED A PROJECT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE DENSITY BONUS. SO SPECIFICALLY WHAT SB TEN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS IMPROVES THE ABILITY FOR DENSITY BONUS TO BE USED FOR STUDENT HOUSING. STUDENT HOUSING IS CONFIGURED DIFFERENTLY THAN REGULAR HOUSING SO THE PARTICULAR- COMPONENTS IN. THIS BILL. HELP MAKE SURE THAT IT COMPLY TO STUDENT HOUSING. IT CONFORMS ARE DENSELY BONUS LOCKED WITH REQUIREMENTS IN OUR HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. IT DADS A- PARKING WAIVER FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE FOR SALE UNITS WITH A MINIMUM OF 40% MODERATE INCOME AND ARE WITHIN A HALF A MILE TRANSIT. AND ELIMINATES THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEE JUST THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEES ON ONLY THE AFFORDABLE IN THE BONUS UNITS NOT ON ANY OTHER UNITS. SO LET ME TALK QUICKLY ABOUT THE FEE PORTION AND IREALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS BECAUSE IT GAVE A GOOD X. A GOOD EXPLANATION OF THAT. THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE DENSITY BONUS LAW IS TO INCENTIVIZE THE BUILDER. TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE UNITS UNDER AND HOW IT DOES IT IS BY GIVING THEM SOME BONUS SOME MORE UNITS THAN THEIR THE ZONING WOULD ALLOW. CHARGING THE FEED THE AFFORDABLE FEE ON THOSE BONUS UNITS IS COUNTER TO THE PURPOSE BECAUSE- THE THOSE UNITS ARE WHAT. HELP COVER THE COSTS OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT DUE TO THE DENSITY BONUS. IT'S SORT OF TECHNICALLY DOUBLE DIPPING. AND SO WHAT CAN EIGHTY FIVE DOES IS HELP US GET IN CONFORMITY WITH A COURT RULING TO LEARN A COURT DECISION WHICH BASICALLY SAID THAT. THE LOCAL ORDINANCES USE OF THAT FEE ON THOSE TWO UNITS WAS COUNTRY AND THERE ARE TURNING GENERAL'S RECENT OPINION WHICH IS CITED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT EXPRESS THAT. IMPOSING FEES ON UNITS IS CONTRADICTORY TO STATE LAW SO IT THIS SO I JUST WANNA BE SOME CONFUSION THAT THE BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE FEES LIKE IF THERE'S A STRUCTURE FEES OR OTHER TYPES OF THE SCHOOL FEES. FEES IN THOSE THINGS IT DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE AND IT ONLY AFFECTS THE FEE ON THE BONUS UNITS THAT IS A FEE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS ALL ALL I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME CONFUSION SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT. THERE'S A FEW JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE RAISED THE ISSUE NOT- ARMED MEN BUT SAM AND I WANTED TO BE A VERY CLEAR AND FINALLY THIS BILL I FEEL IS VERY MEANT THREE TO A. B. TWO THREE FORTY FIVE. ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ THIS BILL WHICH IS INCREASES THE PERCENT OF LOW INCOME UNITS AND LOW INCOME IN ITS THE YOU CAN. GET USING THE DENSE PRESS AND I SUPPORT THAT AND WITH THAT I'LL HAVE MY WITNESS I HAD A KEY WITNESS WHO UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THE CHANGING DATES WAS NOT ABLE TO JOIN US BUT THAT SO I HAVE ANOTHER- I BELIEVE IT IS- DIRECTION. FROM TURNERS. IF I COULD ASK MISTER GROSS FROM THE CENTER TO TEST. A GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR- MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE UP EXACTLY BEEN METCALF ON BEHALF OF THE TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION AT UC BERKELEY WHERE I AM NOW THE MANAGING DIRECTOR. OF THE CAN TODAY TO- DISCUSS BRIEFLY THE TURNER CENTERS RESEARCH ON THE STATE THAT THE BONUS LAW. AND WHY CHANGE THIS LAW- ARE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED TO LIMITS GIVE A VERY BRIEF BIT OF BACKGROUND. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- SPARATE THE CARE CENTER RELEASED THE RESULTS FROM ITS CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL LAND USE SURVEY WHICH- SURVEYED TURNER FIFTY CITIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE REPRESENTING THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION- ECHOING CENTER SCANNERS- STATEMENT EARLIER ONE OF OUR FINDINGS FROM THIS RESEARCH FOR THAT THAT THAT THAT THE BONUS BALL BY ISRAELI USED. FROM TWENTY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLY FIVE. OF TWENTY JURISDICTIONS HAD ANY DEVELOPMENT THE UTILIZED THAT'S THE BONUS- AND MOST OF THESE PLACES THAT HAD USED THAT HAD YOU TO PERHAPS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE- IN FACT ONLY 14% OF THE RESPONDENTS ARE STUDY HAD EVER USED IT FOR THREE OR MORE PROJECTS. ALL THIS TELLS US THAT THE STATE THAT THE BONUS WILD VERY WELL CONCEIVED A VERY IMPORTANT- THE DESTRUCTION TODAY DOES NOT WORK. SO THE WORK AS WELL THE COULD. IDEALLY MORE PROJECTS THAT WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SENSIBLE IN THE FALL LEADING TO THE- PREFERRED OUTCOME OF MORE. RESTRICTIVE AFFORDABLE UNITS AS WELL AS WE MORE HOUSING PLIGHT FOR ALL SO FORCES WELL ARE ARE BADLY DO IT. AND THAT HE BONUS. REPORTER WHENEVER ROBERT HOUSING. I JUST A FEW WEEKS THE TWO CENTER RELEASED POLICY. THAT GAMMA. THE BECAUSE BOTH BY THIS BILL AND ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND OUR ANALYSIS INDICATES- THAT THESE- REVISIONS TO ST LAW PROPOSED. I WOULD MAKE THAT THE BOTH LAW MUCH MORE LIKELY TO WORK IN MANY MORE GEOGRAPHIES AND FOR MANY MORE PROJECTS- WHICH IS WHY- WE AT. THE OUR SUPPORT OF BOTH OF THESE- BUILT BY THE THIRTY FIVE AND ITS COUNTERPART ASSEMBLY BY HAVING A BURKE AND DOLLARS THANK YOU. MISS TOUR MAYBE BEFORE ANY OTHER WITNESSES I MUST APOLOGIZE I DID NOT STATE AT THE BEGINNING WHICH I SHOULD OF THAT I AM ACCEPTING. ALL THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. WHICH ARE THE RINK FULLY REMOVES THE BONUS FOR MODERN MODERATE INCOME RENTAL UNITS. AND VARIOUS THINGS THAT HELP WITH AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FIVE THERE IS ONE A PORTION I THINK IN THE ANALYSIS THAT- EVEN THE COMMITTEE HAS WITHDRAWN- IN TERMS OF AN AMENDMENT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE- WHAT IT WHATEVER FACT I AM ACCEPTING THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE.

TO THE SENATOR I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING WITH OUR COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL- IN PARTICULAR ONE JUST HIGHLIGHT- THERE WERE PROVISIONS AROUND HOW WE ENCOURAGE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I DO THINK. THE STATE SHOULD HAVE A ROLE IN ENCOURAGING MODERATE INCOME HOUSING BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE WAS. DEFINITELY A LOT WE NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T UNDERMINE OR DISINCENTIVE THE CONSTRUCTION OF LOW INCOME OR VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING LAWS ARE PROJECT YOU BEING WILLING TO TAKE THOSE PROVISIONS OUT- AND- AS- AS YOU KNOW. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MAJOR STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS AT WITH THAT- WERE- HAVE REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT- AS THE AUTHOR NOT DISCUSSED. I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK THROUGH A SOLUTION THAT MAKES SENSE IN THIS UP. IN IN THE COMING YEAR. I ALSO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO I KNOW THIS BILL ALSO ADDRESSES THE QUESTION. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEE ON DENSITY BONUS UNITS. THE INTENT OF THE DENSITY BONUS LAW. HAS BEEN- QUITE CLEAR THAT THESE BONUS UNITS ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT- THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. AND THAT THIS BILL WILL STILL ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CHARGE IMPACT FEES. THAT BEING SAID OTHERS AT LEAST ONE JURISDICTION- THAT HAS RAISED THIS ISSUE. APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD ABOUT THIS I KNOW IT'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. WITH THAT I'VE BEEN JUST REMINDED THERE IS ONE PERSON. THE REMOTE TESTIMONY THAT. IN PORT. ASK DOT TO TESTIFY.

ABSOLUTELY THE BILL WHEN WE FIRST CONSTRUCTED AT MY OFFICE MY FIRST CONSTRUCTED IT ONE IN ADDITION TO THE THINGS THAT I DESCRIBED TO WE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THAT IN SOME OF OUR AREAS. THE NUMBER OF THE AREAS THAT THOSE OF US SITTING- IN THE ROOM REPRESENTS THE NOT EVERYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT A NUMBER OF OUR AREAS WHAT WE CONSIDER MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE NOW CANNOT AFFORD HOUSING. AND THE BEST WE HAVE REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR SO EVEN UNIONIZED WORKERS MANY OF OUR UNIONIZED WORKERS CERTAINLY STATE EMPLOYEES AND MANY OTHERS. CANNOT AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING SAY FOR EXAMPLE IN MANY PARTS OF THE BAY AREA SOME PARTS OF SAN DIEGO SOME NEIGHBORHOODS OF LA. SO WE WERE TRYING TO ASSIST. AND DEAL WITH THIS- ISSUE OF QUOTE UNQUOTE MISSING THAT'LL- BUT CERTAINLY. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THROUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH LOTS OF ADVOCATES IN GROUPS AND ALSO WITH YOUR THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN YOUR GOOD WORK WE AGREED TO REMOVE THAT THOUGH AND I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPRESSION OF. HELPING ALL OF US TRY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TOOL TO HELP MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE. GET HOUSING IN THESE HIGH COST AREAS SO IN WHAT BUT WHILE AT WORK THAT IT DIDN'T OTHER DAY. IN ON THE P. ISSUE CERTAINLY ON I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS BECAUSE WHAT WE WHAT WE WANT. IS FOR OUR DB LAW TO WORK. AND WE WANT BUILDERS TO USE IT AND WE WANT MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS SO WHAT EVER WE CAN DO. TO ENHANCE EITHER MODIFY THIS BILL JUST ENHANCE WHAT EVER IT'S TWO WOULD.
