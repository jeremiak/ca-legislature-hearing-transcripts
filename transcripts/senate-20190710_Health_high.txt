THREE SEVENTY NINE BY SUMMER MAN SHINE I AM NUMBER SEVEN EIGHTY FIVE ONE FIVE BY SUMMER MATH THIS ITEM NUMBER TEN EIGHTY SEVEN FIFTEEN BY SOMEONE SYRIAN.

SO THOSE ITEMS ARE ON OUR CONSENT CALENDAR I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- CENTER GROVE -- WHEEL OF FORTUNE NOT BE ABLE TO TEN TODAY SHE IS -- SHE REPRESENTS THEORY BEING AFFECTED BY THE EARTHQUAKES AND SO SHE IS IN HER DISTRICT -- TAKING CARE OF HER CONSTITUENTS AT TOWN HALL -- THIS AGAIN REMINDER OF THE COMMITTEE RULES -- WE ALLOW UP TO SIX MINUTES OF TESTIMONY ON EACH SIDE. IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE TESTS THE FIRES THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIVIDE UP THE SIX MINUTES -- AND THEN WE'LL DO AFTER THE TESTIMONY WE TAKE -- ESSENTIALLY. ADDITIONAL TESTS MAY THE BACK MICROPHONE WHICH WOULD DROP THAT INCLUDE THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE PERSON REPRESENTS A REALIZATION AND POSITION SO NO FURTHER. TESTIMONY THAN THAT SO AT THAT TIME A WELCOME EVERYONE HERE -- SAID NOTING THE LACK OF A QUORUM WE'RE GONNA GO HEAD BEGAN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND I'LL START WITH ITEM NUMBER ONE FOLLOW ORDER -- IT'S SP SIX SIXTY FIVE BY SENATOR UMBERG WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEMBERS BEING PRESENT HERE SHORTLY -- BEFORE USE S. B. SIX SIX FIVE IT WOULD MAKE A SMALL CHANGE THE LAW WHICH COULD RESULT IN MAJOR. POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR MANY INDIVIDUAL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES UNDER PROP SIXTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDS ARE NOT. PERMITTED TO BE SPENT IN STATE PRISONS THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED THE SITUATION WHERE CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT COULD USE THESE FUNDS THE MOST AND OF BEING RESTRICTED FROM RECEIVING. PROGRAMS AND TREATMENTS THAT THEY REALLY NEED ORANGE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE -- IT HAS APPROXIMATELY 30% OF ITS INCARCERATED POPULATION WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE. AND IN FACT THE COUNTY JAILS. PROBABLY THE PLACE WHERE YOU SEE MORE INDIVIDUALS NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAN ANY OTHER GROUP -- OR GROUP BEING WITHIN THE STATE. ACCORDING TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN DATA FROM THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS APPROXIMATELY ONE FIFTH OF COUNTY JAIL INMATES.THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE TAKING PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS A 25% INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN SEVERAL IN ORANGE COUNTY -- OUR NEW SHERIFF SURE OF DON BARNES IS MOVED -- TO TO STOP HOLDING I. C. E. -- DETAINEES IT IS NOW WORKING TO FREE UP ACTUALLY THAT SPACE FOR MENTAL HEALTH CASES -- WITH THE NUMBER OF INCARCERATED WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND LIMITED FUNDING SOURCES FOR TREATMENT IT'S CRITICAL TO EXPLORE THE FLEXIBILITY OF EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING SOURCES. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT WOULD PERMIT THE MONIES -- A CERTAIN M. H. S. A. FUNDS TO BE USED PROVIDE MENTAL SERVICES. TO THOSE WHO ARE IN CARS OR IN COUNTY JAILS NOT FOR PHONES NOT FOR STATE PRISONS IT IS FOR COUNTY JAILS. IT IS A OF AN INVESTMENT IT'S AN INVESTMENT IN IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN OUR COUNTY JAILS THE GOING TO BE RELEASED. AND IF THEY HAVE. MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THE ODDS OF THEM RECEIVING. DECREASED DRAMATICALLY AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE WE'VE WE'VE INTRODUCED SB SIX SIX FIVE A WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS MISTER RICHARD SANCHEZ THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH SERVICES FOR ORANGE COUNTY -- AMY JENKINS REPRESENTING ORANGE COUNTY AND FOR PURPOSES OF ANSWERING QUESTIONS JEFF NAGEL THE DIRECTOR OF ORANGE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH SERVICES THANK THANK YOU WITNESS IS A SPORT THE SPIN. AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RICHARD SANCHES AS THE SENATOR SAID I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH CARE AGENCY AND I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR BOTH THE INCARCERATED IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ALSO THE MEDICARE POPULATION IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I SEE A STARK DIFFERENCE IN THE SERVICES THAT I CAN SUPPLY TO THOSE POPULATIONS. CURRENT LAWS THE SENATOR SAID -- IS SILENT ON THE USE OF M. HSA DOLLARS. FOR PEOPLE INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS AT THE SAME TIME OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AS THE CENTER SAID WE SEE AN INCREASE OF 30%. IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES RELATED TO OUR JAIL POPULATION THAT'S JUST OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SO IT'S TREMENDOUS GROWTH TREMENDOUS GROWTH. AS HE SAID ALSO THAT THE JAIL HAS BECOME THE DE FACTO LARGEST MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY IN THE COUNTY. AND AT THE SAME TIME WITH LIMITED RESOURCES. AS THE PROVIDER OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I RECOGNIZE THE SIMPLE REALITY THAT INCARCERATED PERSONS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE THE SAME PERSON SUFFERING WITH MENTAL HEALTH UPON THE RELEASE. I SEE THEM ON BOTH SIDES I SEE THEM IN THEIR CARS RATED I SEE THEM WHEN THEY'RE HOMELESS ON THE STREET. THIS IS THE SAME POPULATION ONE SIDE GETS A LOT OF SERVICE ONE SIDE MAYBE NOT SO MUCH. THIS BILL PROVIDES S. PROVIDES IN THIS NECESSARY CLARITY TO ME JUST SAY AND WOULD AUTHORIZE THOSE DOLLARS TO BE INCLUDED IF THEY'RE PART OF THE IMAGE SAY ANNUAL PLAN. TO FUND TREATMENT FOR PERSONS INCARCERATED IN THE COUNTY JAIL ARE SUBJECT TO MANDATORY SUPERVISION IS EXCEPT FOR THOSE. INCARCERATED FOR A CONVICTION OF A FELONY. WITH YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL BILL PROVIDES AN OPTION TO COUNTIES TO PLAN FOR AND UTILIZE ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. AND RE ENTRY SERVICES FOR THOSE IN COUNTY JAIL. TO ENSURE THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS PEOPLE. AS THE TRANSITION BOTH IN AND OUT OF JAIL. FOR THOSE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU JOIN ORANGE COUNTY SUPPORTING THIS BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE PROUD SPONSORS OF THIS BILL I'M GOING TO BEGIN BY BY THINKING THE AUTHOR FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE FORWARD. AS ALREADY STATED -- THE COUNTY IT WANTS TO ENSURE THAT MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS RECEIVE TREATMENT AND ARE GIVEN THE BEST OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE TO RETURN TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND BE SUCCESSFUL. ANY USE OF THESE FUNDS WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH THE SAME PUBLIC PROCESS REQUIRED OF ALL MHSAA PROGRAMMING FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY AND REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. SCENE OF BACK MY PHONE -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT AND IF YOU COULD JUST MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THEM EITHER SHUFFLED THE CIDER [inaudible] WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY WITH ACCOUNT IF YOU HAVE A HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REGRET FOR WE WE ARE OPPOSED ON LAST SIGH I POSE TO SB SIX SIX FIVE UNLESS AMENDED TO NARROW THE BILL TO BE A PILOT PROGRAM -- TIME LIMITED UNDER THE INNOVATION COMPONENT OF THE ACT -- TOO WITH AN EVALUATION COMPONENT TO SEE IF THIS NEW USAGE AT AN HSA FUNDS REDUCES INCARCERATION IN PRISON LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY TREATMENT. AND PROVE HOUSING ATTAINMENT AND EMPLOYMENT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD RECEIVE SERVICES THROUGH THIS NEW USE OF FUNDING. THE IMAGES SAY AND CURRENT LAW INCLUDES AN EXCLUSION OF USING THE FUNDING FOR STATE CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND THEN ADDITIONALLY DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS INTERPRETED THIS ENTITLE NINE REGULATIONS. TO MEAN THAT YOU CAN ONLY USE AN HSA FUNDS FOR FACILITATING DISCHARGE WITH TOM FROM COUNTY FACILITIES. THIS BILL WOULD END UP CONSTITUTING USAGE I'VE MHSAA FUNDS IN THE TWENTY FIFTEEN THE SENTENCING PROJECT ENDED UP DOING A RANKING OF ALL FIFTY STATES A BASED ON THEIR ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND THEN THEIR INCARCERATION RATES -- SIX OF THE TEN TOP STATES THAT HAD THE LEAST ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH HAD THE FIVE AXIS THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. HAD THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATES. THE INTENT OF THE M. HSA AS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS IS TO REDUCE THE LONG TERM ADVERSE OUTCOMES -- UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS IN AND P. I. SECTION THIS IS SPECIFIED EVEN CLEAR THAT ONE OF THE GOALS AT THE MHSAA IS TO REDUCE THE INCARCERATION OF INDIVIDUALS -- OUR MEMBERS HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT THE BLANKET REMOVAL -- THE EXCLUSION OF PROVIDING SERVICES IN JAILS -- AND THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS DIVERTED INTO AN INSTANT A LOCKED INSTITUTION -- WHILE THIS BILL IS PERMISSIVE AND SAYING THAT FUNDING FOR THEM WOULD BE FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THEIR THREE YEAR PLAN SUBJECT TO THE COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS. NOT ALL OF THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR LEVEL AND MAY BE MADE BY THE CEO OR SEE A THIS OFFICE TO PUNT. AND THEY MAY FIND PUBLIC SAFETY OVER COMMUNITY IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WE DO SUPPORT PROVIDING -- HIGH QUALITY -- SERVICES IN JAILS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THEM BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFESAVING COMMUNITY TREATMENT WHICH CAN HELP PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM BEING INCARCERATED IN THE FIRST PLACE -- IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THIS TIME LIMITED WITH EVALUATION. IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THESE JAIL BASED SERVICES WOULD END UP BEING. AND OUR PONDER REENTRY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE REPRESENT ALL COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS APPROACH GEO BASED CARE AND FUNDING IN A WAY TO SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT A PILOT PROGRAM FOR THIS PURPOSE WOULD ALLOW ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHER INTERESTED COUNTIES TO ALLOCATE THIS PURPOSE THIS FUNDING TO MEET THEIR LOCAL NEEDS. WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING BROADER CONCERNS OF FROM OTHER MEMBERS WHO NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT PULL OUT. THE THE RUG FROM THE LARGER SET OF OUR IMAGE IS A FUN AND SERVICES INCLUDING MHSAA WHICH IS USED TO LEVERAGE ON MEDIC COW MATCH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSED WITH -- SENATOR UMBERG IN ORANGE COUNTY -- BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE CONTINUE TO BE A POET MY CEMENTED ON THE BILL THANK YOU. I THINK YOU ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. A SINGING NUN TURNS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SO ACTUALLY -- MAYBE I CAN HAVE SOME OF YOUR PROPONENT WITNESSES COME BACK UP FROM HER UNDER COUNTY HAS HAD ITS SHARE YES I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS YES IT'S LIKE THE WHAT WHAT OTHER COMING UP MAY RESPOND -- YES ACTUALLY -- YEAH WE DO WANT YOU I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WAS GONNA ASK THEM BUT WHAT I'LL GO IN THE GUT LEVY OUT CENTER OF IT PLEASE RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITE A COUPLE THINGS ONE THAT WE ARE UNAWARE THE OPPOSITION TILL MOST RECENTLY AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO WORK. WITH THE OPPONENTS NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS IS ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THEM MAKING PROBABLY THE STRONGEST -- PROVIDE DESTROYS BIT OF EVIDENCE IS THE NECESSITY FOR THIS BILL AND AND THAT IS I I WASN'T AWARE THAT THE STATES WITH AT LEAST ACCESS. TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HAVE THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATES WHICH WHICH PROVES MY POINT THE POINT IS IS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PLACE TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TERMS OF RECIDIVISM. BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AS WELL AS FOR THE COMMUNITY -- AND YOU YOU HAD SOME OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER CHAIR -- YES SO SO ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SO WHEN THE CAT QUESTIONS I HAD WAS -- IN RELATION TO SO FIRST OF ALL UNDER THE ACT YOU CAN'T SUPPLANT. SO IT'S SO WHAT KIND OF FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT KIND OF THINGS AS ORANGE THAT'S IN WHICH YOU'RE SEEKING THIS LEGISLATION SO I RECOGNIZE CERTAINLY THE JAIL IS BUT I THINK THE OPPOSITION DOES POINT OUT. THIS IS ABOUT KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF INCARCERATION WE WIDE DIED I WANT TO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FUNDS SO THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED MOVE HALTS OKAY JUST PERHAPS SPEAK -- TO THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND HOW YOU ANTICIPATE -- WITH THIS FLEXIBILITY USE IT -- USING YOUR IMAGES SAFE FUNDS THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING WITH THROUGH THIS BILL. I'M THE NONSTOP PLANTATION -- A RULE WITHIN THE MAIL SERVICES ACT. REQUIRES THAT -- A PROGRAMS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PASSING OF THE ACT CANNOT BE REPLACED WITH -- AN HSA FUNDING SO AN EXPANSION OF SERVICES -- WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THAT -- NON SUPPLANT ROLE. THE QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT SERVICES WOULD BE USED -- RATE SO YES I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHAT KIND OF THINGS YOU WOULD BE DOING AND I APPRECIATE YOUR STATEMENT ABOUT AN EXPANSION LOOKING AT PIECE OF PLANTATION -- THAT ACTUALLY RAISES PEOPLE'S ANXIETIES BECAUSE WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO SEE AND IT'S IT'S A FUN SIMPLY BEING USED. TO BECAUSE IT'S A LARGER JAIL POPULATION SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT KIND INNOVATIONS ARE THINGS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IN RELATION -- TO USE OF AN HSA FUNDS IN ORANGE COUNTY. YEAH YES -- IT IN WITHIN OUR JAILS WE HAVE THE SAME POPULATION NEEDS IN OUR MENTAL. ARE MENTALLY ILL THAT WE DO ON THE STREETS SO WOULD B VERY SIMILAR TO THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. TO OUR MANAGES A FUNDED NOW ACCEPTED WOULD BE WITH THE CAPTIVE POPULATION THAT WE CAN TREAT AND DOESN'T YOU KNOW. WITH BEING CONFINED THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT THAT TREATMENT SO EVERYTHING FROM THE PREVENTION EARLY PENSION TO CRISIS MANAGEMENT. THOSE ARE THE SERVICES THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING LPS BEDS AND EXPANSION OF LPS BEDS -- PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS WHEN NECESSARY IN EXPANDING THOSE SERVICES TO THE MENTALLY ILL WITHIN THE JAIL POPULATION ALL RIGHT SO -- SO I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL -- AND SAID THAT -- THE HOPE THE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I WANNA MAKE NOTE IS THAT. I AGREE WITH SENATOR UMBERG AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE JAILS BUT I ALSO THINK THAT. THE PURPOSE OF THESE FUNDS. WAS NOT TO AUGMENT AND SAY WELL OUR JAIL POPULATION IS GROWING AND SO WE NEED MORE MONEY AND WE ALL LOOKED AT ME TO SAY. THE PURPOSE OF AN HSA IS THE MOVE THEM OUT OF JAIL. SO -- SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WELL THE CONCENTRATED THERE NOW AND LOCK AND KEY AND WE CAN MORE FOCUS ON THEM OKAY -- AT BUT I THINK THE PURPOSE IS TO SO CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU PLAN TO USE THE FUNDS TO HELP PEOPLE GET OUT OF JAIL I REALIZE WE'RE GIVING YOU SOME FLEXIBILITY SO YOU CAN USE OF PEOPLE ARE IN JAIL. CELL BUT THE PURPOSE IS TO GET THEM OUT RIGHT MAYBE I WOULD ANSWER THAT BY WOULD THAT WOULD HELP AND STAY OUT OF JAIL AFTER BEING RELEASED. OKAY THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S ABOUT IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE METS WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THERE'S A THERE'S A WHOLE RE ENTRY PORTION TO THIS AS WELL OKAY THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR RIGHT HE'S ABOUT RE ENTRY RIGHT SO YOU CAN START WHILE THEY'RE IN THE JOBS RIGHT. NOW YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY'RE ACTUALLY OUT AND YOU CAN'T LINK THEM UP JUST LIKE A HOSPITAL THERE'S A DISCHARGE PLAN THAT GOES ALONG WITH EVERY INMATE THAT WE WOULD WANT TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR SYSTEM. SO WHEN THEY HIT THE STREET THEY JUST DON'T GO BACK TO THEIR OLD WAYS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW OKAY ALL RIGHT SO -- I A CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I ALSO URGE THAT YOU WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION I THINK THE FOCUS ON BASICALLY HOW DO YOU HELP PEOPLE GET OUT TO THE TRANSITION PLAN HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BILL START WHILE THEY'RE IN THE JAIL NOT HAVE TO WAIT. BECAUSE THE RESTRICTION IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS A GOOD THING -- BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL AND THEN BE SURE THEY CAN STAY OUT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOLD INITIATIVE WE DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE IN JAIL WANT FEWER PEOPLE IN JAIL. CELL -- I CERTAINLY HOPE TO HEAR THAT THAT'S BEEN THE FOCUS OF ANY SORT OF EFFORTS -- AND I THINK -- PERHAPS THAT ALSO SPEAKS A LITTLE TO THE CONCERN OF THE OPPOSITION AS WELL SO -- SO IT DOES SO CERTAINLY -- WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE CAN ACTUALLY MOVE THE BILL OR ANYTHING BUT I HOPE THAT MAYBE PERHAPS SO YOU CAN THEN YOUR CLOTHES SPEAK -- TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ON ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. SO BUZZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR I'VE HEARD YOUR POINT WITH RESPECT TO SUPPLICATION I'VE HEARD YOUR POINT AS TO WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS GOING TO BE NEW AND DIFFERENT. RATHER THAN JUST DOING THE SAME OLD TO MORE PEOPLE I THINK THAT'S YOUR POINT AND AND I I IF I'VE HEARD THAT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING THINGS THAT ARE NEW AND DIFFERENT -- SO THAT. WE USE OUR BEST EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE IN JAIL DON'T RETURN TO JAIL. OKAY BUT THAT ORIGINAL VOCALS AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S FINE NOW YOU SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T I BUT WE CAN'T GO YET BUT SENATOR SANDERS HOUSES AND ARMOR AS ONE WHO -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND GETTING THE DISCUSSION STARTED AND I KNOW YOUR YOU'RE YOU'RE A MAN OF YOUR WORD YOU'RE GONNA WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE WANT TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL AND AND AND REDUCE THE RECIDIVISM RATE AND GIVE THEM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THEY NEED IT I APPRECIATE THE APPOINTED SHOOT YOUR PRODUCT BUT I WANTED I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND RESHAPE HER FORWARD. THANK YOU CENTER STONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN WE HAVE A CARAMEL TAKE UP THE BILL FOR ABOUT EIGHT THIRTY MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ALRIGHT I SEE IS SOME A MEMBER WOULD HERE WELCOME. AND OKAY SO -- AND STAND YOU BY WELL YOU HAVE MANY BILLS BEFORE US BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO YOU NEED TO PRESENT. THREE OR ON CONSENT SO -- WE WANT TO TAKE THEM UP THE FILE ORDER. OKAY SO WE'LL START OFF WITH A NUMBER TO A BETWEEN. TWO OH FOUR WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR -- DOCTOR DOCTOR PAN AND AND MEMBERS -- EIGHTY TWO OH FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS ARE THE SERVICES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS PROVIDE TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR TAX EXEMPT STATUS. AND INCLUDE CHARITY CARE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND DONATIONS OF FUNDS ARE RESOURCES I CONTRIBUTE TO A COMMUNITY PRIORITIES SUCH AS HOUSING. HOWEVER THERE IS NO STANDARDIZED REQUIREMENT FOR CALCULATING AND REPORTING THE VALUE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COMMUNITIES TO KNOW THE VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS BEING PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL. A B. TWO OH FOUR REVISES COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BY DEFINING CHARITY CARE AND REQUIRING HOSPITALS REPORT CHARITY CARE AT COST. THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES SMALL AND RURAL HOSPITALS THAT ARE PART OF THE SYSTEM TO REPORT -- AND RICK AND REQUIRES US PAD TO ANNUALLY PREPARE A REPORT ON THE AMOUNT EACH HOSPITAL SPENDS ON COMMUNITY BENEFITS. SPELT BILLS INTENDED TO ASSURE THAT IS A HOT AS HOSPITAL SYSTEM SYSTEMS GROW IN SIZE. THE INDIVIDUAL HOSPITALS IN THE SYSTEM REMAIN MEANINGFUL OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WITH ME -- MARY JANE A MERRY TUNE DHEAS WITH -- HEALTH ACCESS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. AFTER YOU MISTER CHAIR AND CENTERS AND JDS HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA PLEASE TO SUPPORT A B. TWO OH FOUR WHICH WOULD REQUIRE ALL SPREAD TO PUBLISH A REPORT AND HOW MUCH. HOSPITAL SPENT ON COMMUNITY BENEFIT WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS THAT DEFINE CHARITY CARE WHICH REFLECTS THAT TO CHARITY CARE. IS GIVEN WITHOUT EXPECTATION OF ANY COMPENSATION AND NOT AFTER HUNTING PATIENCE FOR UNPAID HOSPITAL BILLS OR SENDING THEM TO COLLECTIONS FOR BAD DEBT. LACK OF REPORTING OF THE ACTUAL MONETARY VALUE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT INVESTMENT IS PROBLEMATIC. THIS IS BECAUSE POLICY MAKERS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL VALUE IS OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS BEING PROVIDED IN EXCHANGE FOR THE LOCAL HOSPITALS. TAX EXEMPT STATUS WHILE COMMUNITY BENEFITS MAY BE EXPRESSIONS OF NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CHARITABLE MISSION THEY SHOULD ALSO SERVE AS JUSTIFICATION FOR THEIR TAX EXEMPT SHIN. EIGHTY TWO OH FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THAT INSURERS TAX EXEMPT PRIVATE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS ARE PROVING THEIR WORTH AND ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING MEASURABLE COMMUNITY BENEFITS. TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE EVEN AFTER THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACA OR THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS REMAIN UNINSURED AND MANY MORE ARE UNDER INSURED AND CANNOT AFFORD THEIR HEALTH CARE. FOR THESE REASONS WE REQUEST YOUR IDOL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SERAPH LOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. OKAY SEEN OTHERS IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. SAYING NINE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WE OFFER BRING ABOARD. OKAY WELL.

TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY SIXTEEN FORTY TWO THANK YOU AGAIN A CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- IN MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A CRITICAL AUDIT ON HOW WELL THE MEDICARE PROGRAM PROVIDES PREVENTIVE CARE TO CHILDREN. WHICH IS. APPARENTLY NOT VERY WELL -- THE BILLABLE TO WOULD TAKE UP A NUMBER OF STEPS TO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR BY ADDRESSING STATE PAYMENT RATE PLAN RATES TO PLANS. INCREASING THE PENALTIES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND REQUIRING PLANS TO ATTEMPT TO FIND A CLOSER SPECIALIST WHEN BENEFICIARIES HAVE TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA. BUT ALSO REQUIRE AN OUTREACH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM ON PREVENTIVE SERVICES I'D LIKE TO TAKE I'D LIKE TO TAKE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS -- SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONCERNS THE SERGEANTS ARE PASSING OUT A MOCK UP A COUPLE OF THE MAJOR CHANGES WORTH HIGHLIGHTING -- THE AMENDMENT -- RECORD THAT WOULD REQUIRE FOR THE PURPOSES OF A REQUIREMENT THAT MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS MAKE THEIR BEST EFFORT TO ESTABLISH A MEMBER SPECIFIC CASE AGREEMENT. WITH AN APPROPRIATE SPECIALIST PROVIDER THE RATE -- TO BE THE MEDICARE RATE FOR SERVICE RATE OR ADMIT RATE MUTUALLY AGREED UPON BETWEEN THE SPECIALIST AND THE MEDICAL MEDICARE PLAN. PLANS WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT IF THE PLAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO CONTRACT WITH A SPECIALIST IN THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR. AND ALSO ON THE PENALTY PROVISIONS THE AMENDMENTS REQUIRE THE DH CS DIRECTOR -- TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF THE PENALTY -- BASED ON MULTIPLE NONEXCLUSIVE FACTORS AND ADD TO THE LIST OF ELEVEN FACTORS THE DH CS IS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER -- THE PREMISES -- THE PREMISE OF THE OF THE BILL IS SIMPLE THE TECH IS VERY TECHNICAL IN NATURE -- ASPIRIN I VOTE AND PLEASE BE KIND AND YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU WITNESSES ABOARD. THE WIND AWAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SUPPORT TO INSURE MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO GET NEEDED.

TO ASSIST AFFECTED MEMBERS AND REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO EVALUATE -- IF PLANS REQUEST A LONGER TIME EDISON STANDARDS IF THAT LONGER TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARD IS REASONABLE FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE. WE'RE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE SELF THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT. LINDA TERROR WITH WITH THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK IN SUPPORT.

I AM HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT A WELL INTENTIONED POLICY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE WAY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS CONTRACT WITH THOSE PROVIDERS. IF THE PLANS ARE ABLE TO ESTABLISH PROLIFIC MEMBERS SPECIFIC CASE AGREEMENTS. IT COULD DISINCENTIVE EYES THE PLANTS FROM ATTEMPTING TO CONTRACT WITH THOSE SAME SPECIALIST. WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE BILL IN UPDATING OUR POSITION WHEN IT'S IN PRINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BUT THIS IS AN OPPOSITION.

TWELVE FORTY NINE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- AT AS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN MOCK UP FORM AND WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND IN PARTICULAR AT THE CHAIR FOR HIS WORK. MAYBE TWELVE FORTY NINE REPRESENTS AN INNOVATIVE% APPROACH TO CONTAIN SKYROCKETING HEALTHCARE COSTS. EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES STRUGGLE TO CONTAIN COSTS AND OBTAIN THE BEST QUALITY OF CARE. THERE IS A GROWING MOVEMENT ACROSS THE NATION TO PERRIN PLAYER HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS WITH ORGANIZED INTEGRATED PROVIDERS IN A MORE ALIGNED RELATIONSHIP TO PRODUCE BETTER CARE AT LOWER COST. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE TWO PILOTS ONE IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE STATE AND THE OTHER IN THE NORTHERN PORTION THAT WOULD OPERATE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE PILOTS WOULD INCLUDE RISK BEARING PROVIDERS THAT ARE MONITORED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE FOR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY. AND AND OPERATION SELF FUNDED EMPLOYER PLANS WOULD USE WRIST BASED PAYMENT MECHANISMS WITH THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. FOR THEIR SERVICES RATHER THAN PURE FEE FOR SERVICE COMPENSATION. A STUDY BY THE UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH PREDICTED THIS TYPE OF MODEL COULD REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES BY AN ESTIMATED ONE HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTION FOR CONSUMERS LANE ON A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION COMPONENTS SUCH AS ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS AND A COMPLAINTS PROCESS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE CONTRACTING PROCESS. FOR THE PILOT PROGRAMS. CONTAINING THE RISING COST OF HEALTHCARE REQUIRES A NEW WAY OF THINKING THIS PILOT-- THE PROJECT WILL AUTHORIZED BY THIS BILL CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE APPROACH HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. HERE WITH ME JUST A TAD TESTIFY ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE -- BUT TYPE FIRST OFFICE IN THE MARTIN THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

UNIQUE PILOT PROGRAM TO ALLOW US TO GO OUT AND CONTINUE TO DIRECT CONTRACT IN WE HAVE ONE TRUST FUND CONTINUED TO GO OUT IN DIRECT CONTRACT BUT ON A CAPITATED BASIS.

IF I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR BETH CAPELL ON BEHALF OF HEALTH TEXAS CALIFORNIA WE HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED POSITION. WE'VE NEVER OPPOSE THE PILOT PROJECT WHAT WE OPPOSED WAS EXEMPTING THE RESTORING MEDICAL GROUPS FROM THE MANY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE KNOX KEEN ACT THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT SO LONG AND SO HARD. FOR WE ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND ANTICIPATE THE ONCE WE SEE THE BILL THE COUNT LEDGE COUNCIL VERSION OF THIS. LANGUAGE THAT WE WILL BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION FORMALLY. OKAY SO ALL RIGHT WELL WE'LL GO AND RESTART THE CLOCK FOR THE ACTUAL OPPOSITION AND BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE ALL SIX MINUTES WE DON'T WANT TO GO RIGHT. I DON'T THINK I WILL BE -- MISTER CHAIR -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURRS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS -- WE HAVE RECEIVED A DRAFT VERSION OF THE AMENDMENT SO -- YOU KNOW WERE WERE THAT I'M TAKING OUR TIME TO ANALYZE THOSE. I THINK YOU KNOW LIKE VIS A PREVIOUS SPEAKER UNIT WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO SEE THE FINAL VERSION OF THAT IN FRANCE AND FOR WHAT WE CAN TELL US -- YOU KNOW THE AMENDMENTS DO YOU INTEND TO FILE OFF SOME OF THE THE ROUGHER EDGES. OF OF OF THE BILL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE -- BUT WE DO HAVE A STREET OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL IN PRINT TO BE FAIR AND I THINK IT'S BASED ON A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE. YOU KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A HEALTH PLAN ACTS LIKE A HEALTH PLAN THE NEEDS TO FALL THE SAME RULES -- AS A HEALTH PLAN IN SO -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT BILLS LIKE THIS THAT EXAM TO OTHER ENTITIES FROM PROVISIONS OF THE KNOX KEEN ACT YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THAT -- CREATES UNFAIR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES -- YOU KNOW AGAINST MY MEMBERSHIP WHICH HAS TO COMPLY WITH A PRETTY RIGOROUS SET OF RULES REGULATIONS AND LAWS -- YOU KNOW THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS AND PROTECTS THE MARKET -- AND SO YOU KNOW AMONG OTHER THINGS HE OBVIOUSLY HEALTH PLANS HAVE TO YOU KNOW PROVIDE. YOU A FULL PANOPLY OF OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES UNDER THE LAW AND HERE TO FINANCIAL SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS -- TIMELY ACCESS IN OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT MATTERS OF LAW -- NEAR THE BILL INFRINGES REMOVES SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS -- AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS -- WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE AMENDMENTS ONCE THE BILLS IN FRANCE AND YOU PROVIDE FURTHER COMMENT AT THAT POINT BUT YOU KNOW I DID AT THIS POINT IN TIME WERE OPPOSED. TO THE BILL -- AS IT'S CURRENTLY IN PRINT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] A MICROPHONE. BUT SEVENTY WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TOO ARE IN OPPOSITION WE LANARK COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT REMOVING ANY POTENTIAL PATIENT -- CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I'D SEEN OTHER WITNESSES -- QUESTIONS A COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER STONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I CERTAINLY. SUPPORT PILOT PROGRAMS BY SPECIALLY SO MANY -- GROUPS THAT SEEK TO MAYBE DO BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND LOWER COSTS FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS USED. TO AT THE OPEN ENROLLMENT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH HOW MUCH OUR HEALTH CARE IN A CALL NOW. SO FROM ONE ONE APPLAUD YOU FOR FOR BRINGING AUTHORITY THE STICKING POINT FOR ME WAS THE EXEMPTION FROM THE KNOX KEEN. SO COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY THAT -- YOU ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT CAN YOU JUST. BRIEFLY TELL TELL US WHAT THAT AMOUNT IS WE HAVE ACCEPTED THAT THAT AMENDMENT ALL I ASK AT MR WATCH TO TO CHECK ON THAT. YES. SO I'M GONNA GET IN BEHALF OF ALL THE TAFT HARTLEY TRUST FUNDS THAT I REPRESENT WE THINK THAT THE COMEDIAN AMENDMENT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW ART TAFT CHARLIE TRUST FUNDS ARE RISA PRINTED SO WE'RE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN THE KNOX KEEN ACT. BECAUSE RUMORS THAT PRINTED IN BECAUSE IT'S A REPRESENTED WORK FORCE YOU KNOW IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO LOOK AFTER THE THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR MEMBERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THEY GET A VOTE. IN SO FOR THAT REASON -- WE BELIEVE THAT -- WE PROVIDE MORE THAN AMPLE PROTECTIONS TO OUR MEMBERS SAID WE'VE DONE DONE A GOOD JOB SINCE THE THIRTIES -- BUT THE COMMITTEE I THINK IS STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING SOME MINIMAL -- FLOORS A TO SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZING THE FLEXIBILITY SO WE CAN TRY. TO ACHIEVE THE COST SAVINGS THROUGH UNIQUE BENEFITS DESIGNED AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND ARE THERE ANY YOU ARE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL -- TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE PRIZES TO THE HOPEFULLY THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE HAVING TO THIS PART OF PROGRAMS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY IN FACT WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE THOSE A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT IT'S JUST NOT IT'S THAT THE DATA IS ALL THAT IT SHOULD BE. OKAY AGAIN THANKS TO THE THE AUTHOR APPRECIATE ALSO MISTER BARCELONA'S EDUCATING MY OFFICE ON ON THE BILL. AND LOOKING FOR TO SUPPORTING IT TODAY. THANK YOU. FOR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS AT SWANSEA'S FIRST BY ONE THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS FOR WORKING WITH -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND MYSELF ON THE BILL YOU KNOW WE WE WANT -- TO PROMOTE INNOVATION -- BUT INNOVATION CAN'T BE AT THE EXPENSE OF PATIENTS AND AIDS -- DO I RECOGNIZE THAT -- WE'RE WORKING WITH ENTITIES THAT -- FIRST OF ALL READY PART OF A RISA. AND SO WITH ISN'T IT SO -- AND ALSO THAT -- YOU'LL HAVE A LONGSTANDING HISTORY OF TAKING CARE OF MEMBERS OF THE REPRESENTED WORK FOR SO THAT THE ACTUAL. RECIPIENTS ARE ALSO PART OF THE GOVERNANCE AND BEEN ANYWAYS BECAUSE OF THAT. BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE WERE -- SHIFTING FROM A CONTRACT FOR YOUR CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS ON THE FEEL FREE FOR SERVICE BASIS TO A CAPITATED BASIS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR LINE RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SO WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE MAKES A CAPITATED AGREEMENT. AND IT TURNS OUT THEY MADE SOME BAD DECISIONS AND NOW THE GROUP OR WHATEVER SAYS OH WELL YOU KNOW WE CAN'T MAKE IT WORK TOGETHER. WE DON'T WANT. PATIENTS GETTING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE SO WE'VE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE WE'VE HAD CAPITATED ENTITIES WHO MAY HAVE MADE BAD. BUSINESS DECISIONS THERE OR WHATEVER ACTUARY WEARABLE DIDN'T WORK IT OUT AND NOW THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE WRONG END OF THE STICK. AND EITHER THEY CAN'T KEEP GOING OR THEY DON'T WANT TO KEEP GOING AND PEOPLE BAIL RIGHT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS. SO WE CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE ONE GROUP SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT WITH A CONTRACT IS JUST TAKE CARE OF THE OTHER ONES AS WE CAN'T -- WE WANT. AND AND AND WHILE WE'RE BATTLING THAT OUT PATIENTS CAN GET CARE AND SO I APPRECIATE AGAIN -- TAKING THE AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT BE SURE WE HAVE FINANCIAL SOLVENCY STANDARDS BECAUSE THIS IS ABOUT TRANSFERRING RISK THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN JUST SAYING WHAT YOU DO SURGERY I'LL PAY YOU X. AMOUNT. NOW THIS IS A CAPITATION THERE'S RISK INVOLVED AND SO APPRECIATE THOSE PROTECTIONS -- WHILE STILL TRYING TO PROTECT THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ALLOW YOU TO DO SOMETHING THAT DAY KIND OF INNOVATION AND ALSO JUST TO MAKE -- MENTION AS WELL AS THAT -- THIS ASPILOTS SO WE'RE REQUIRING AN EVALUATION BY TEAMMATES SEE WHICH BY THE WAY IS FUNDED BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE PILOTS SELLING UNTIL THE V. AND A GOOD THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE VALUATION AS WELL. SO -- THIS SO THERE WILL BE AS WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS OUT AND HOPEFULLY IT'S EXCESS FULL AND WE CAN. THAT THIS EFFORT CAN CONTINUE SO CERTAINLY I'M IN SUPPORT OF BILL WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AT AND THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AT THE END OF THE DAY A B. TWELVE FORTY NINE IS ABOUT BETTER CARE AT LOWER COST. FOR WORKING FAMILIES THIS WILL PROVIDE BETTER TOOLS TO MANAGE HEALTHCARE SPENDING AND AND AS HAS BEEN SAID WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SOPHISTICATED -- KIND OF POOL BUT EVEN WITH THAT THERE ARE VERY STRONG CONSUMER FOR TIONS HERE -- AND FINALLY IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM AND WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE DATA AND SEE THE RESULTS AND AND AS A LEGISLATURE AS WE MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE -- MAKE SOME EDUCATED DETERMINATIONS FROM THAT FROM THAT DATA AND I WOULD DIE THANK YOU AGAIN MISTER CHAIRMAN SPECTER REQUESTED MY VOTE.

AB FIFTY FIFTY WOULD EXTEND THE TIME A PERSON CAN RECEIVE SERVICES AT A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT FROM TWENTY FOUR HOURS TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS. AND WHAT STEPS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE CENTERS THAT PROVIDE KEY SHORT TERM SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING A MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY. HOWEVER THE CURRENT TWENTY FOUR HOUR LIMITATION AT THESE FACILITIES OFTEN FORCES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS TO STOP CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS BEFORE THEY ARE STABILIZED. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IT TAKES AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY NINE POINT ONE FIVE HOURS OF STABILIZATION SERVICES TO STABILIZE. AN ADULT THIS MEANS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE OFTEN NOT FULLY STABILIZING OFTEN RETURN TO EMERGENCY ROOM THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A MORE DIRE SITUATION WHICH LEADS TO INCREASED HEALTH COSTS. FOR THE PUBLIC -- THE STORES RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT UP TO NOW NO NOVO TO NO OPPOSITION UP TO NOW WITHOUT A RESPECT AFTER I VOTE -- WE ARE WITH ME TO SUPPORT IS ADRIAN SHELTON FROM THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE OKAY WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADRIAN CHILTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL FIFTEEN FIFTY TODAY.

THESE FACILITIES PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF ASSISTANCE TO OUR STATE -- NOT JUST AND HELPING ALLEVIATE EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING IN ASSISTING FIRST RESPONDERS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE RECEIVE THE CARE THAT THEY NEEDED A MORE APPROPRIATE HEALING SETTING FOR SOMEBODY IN A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. SO WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENT IN THESE FACILITIES OF THE UP AND UP MOST IMPORTANCE AND EXTENDING THAT TIME THE INDIVIDUALS CAN REMAIN THERE WILL ALLOW FOR MORE SEAMLESS LINKAGE -- INTO THE COMMUNITY SO WE BELIEVE THIS FRAMEWORK IS A LONG WAY IN THE BILL TO MORE APPROPRIATELY SERVING CLIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR EITHER THANK YOU.

FIRST I WILL BE TAKING THE COMMITTEE'S CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR IS FOLLOW UP LEADS TO LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED LAST YEAR. THIS BILL WILL ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS CARE WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. FOR EXAMPLE. DURING THE TUBS FIRE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE SANTA ROSA COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CENTER. PROVIDERS MADE FOURTEEN HUNDRED TWELVE TELEPHONIC VISITS TO THEIR PATIENTS. UNFORTUNATELY THE CENTER HE IS YET TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE CARE PROVIDED AND THERE'S NO GUIDANCE ON HOW CLAIMS AND RECORD SHOULD BE SUBMITTED. TO THE STATE DURING EMERGENCIES WHEN CLINICS ARE INACCESSIBLE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED. AB FOURTEEN NINETY FOUR CLARIFIES THE SERVICES PERFORM OUTSIDE THE CLINICS FOR WALLS DUE TO AN EMERGENCY SITUATION MUST BE REIMBURSABLE WHETHER IN A SHELTER. A PATIENT'S HOME BY PHONE OR THROUGH TELEHEALTH. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ESTABLISH A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DEVELOP. GUIDANCE TO THIS ISSUE SO THAT THE STANDARDS AND EXPECTATIONS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF SERVICES PROVIDED DURING AN EMERGENCY ARE CLEAR. SENATORS I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. GET THE SUPPORT WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES THE AFFILIATE OF THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS THE OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA -- AS THE AUTHOR STATED WE DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE FIRE IN IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE HAD ABOUT TWO DOZEN HEALTH CENTER CORPORATION SERVING A TEN COUNTY REGION WHICH SERVE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PATIENTS IMPACTED BY THE FIRES -- MOST NOTABLY -- OF EXAMPLE WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE CENTER IS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER WHICH LOST -- COMPLETELY THEIR LARGEST CAMPUS THAT SERVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND PATIENTS SO THEY WERE REALLY TRYING TO REACH-OUR PATIENTS HE ATTACK -- THE TELEPHONE TRYING TO LOCATE THEM WHERE THEY WERE EITHER IN AN EVACUATION SHELTER OR OUTSIDE OF THE REGION -- FOLLOW UP WITH THE PATIENTS WHO HAD JUST BEEN PRESCRIBED PERHAPS MENTAL HEALTH MEDICATIONS MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T HAVING ANY SORT OF SIDE EFFECTS FOLLOW UP WITH THEIR ADS -- PATIENTS WHO HAVE AS MUCH TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE NOT -- ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE FIRES -- AND BECAUSE AS THE AUTHOR STATED THE LIMITATIONS AROUND HOW A COMMUNITY CLINIC CAN BE REIMBURSED IF THAT OF THIS IT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH INSIDE THE FOUR WALLS OF THE CLINIC THEY CANNOT BE REIMBURSED SO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT -- TO PROVIDE CLARITY TO THE HEALTH CENTERS ABOUT WHAT THE HOW THEY CAN -- OPERATE DURING A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY WHEN THERE ACTUALLY IS NO HEALTH CENTER -- SO WE WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE THE HEALTH CENTERS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPACTED BUT TO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY GOING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS -- FOR HEALTH CENTER SO THEY KNOW HOW TO OPERATE AND BE ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE SO WANT TO THANK YOU IN OUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US AND WOULD ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY.

I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A SIMILAR BILL SIXTEEN AT NINETY FIVE WHICH MAKES NECESSARY REFORMS TO THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY WHEN A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. A CURSE TO ADDRESS ISSUES WITH TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS DURING THIS PROCESS. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN B THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE NEW PRE APPROVAL PROCESS BY SIX MONTHS AND ALLOWING THE INTERIM PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE DEPARTMENT IF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS NOT MADE A DECISION. IN NINETY DAYS THESE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING PASSED OUT TO THE MEMBERS NOW. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING CERTIFYING AND ENFORCING. REGULATORY STANDARDS RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF CARE PROVIDED IN SKILLED NURSING HOME FACILITIES.

NO LATER THAN NINETY DAYS PRIOR TO THE SALE OR TRANSFER AND REQUIRES A DEPARTMENT WITHIN NINETY DAYS OF THIS NOTICE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROSPECTIVE LICENSEES. IS SUITABLE FOR LICENSURE OR IF THEY'RE NOT. SECOND. BY PROHIBITING THE DEPARTMENT FOR PROVIDING. I'M SORRY PROHIBITING THE DEPARTMENT FROM APPROVING A TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OR APPLICATION TO OPERATE A FACILITY.

THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORREO FOR YOUR WORK SPONSORING THIS BILL AND TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR HEARING US OUT TODAY. MY NAME IS STATION LAMBERT I'M REPRESENTING US YEAH YOU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN AND WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS WITH US TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AS WELL. OUR INTEREST IN PASSING AB SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE DERIVED FROM THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED AS A UNION GUIDING AND SUPPORTING OUR NURSING HOME MEMBERS WHEN. NURSE WHEN NOT CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP OCCUR WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS VARIOUSLY AS THE SITUATIONS OCCUR THAT THEIR PAYCHECKS RELATE. THAT PAYCHECKS THAT HAD BEEN DISPERSED BY THE NEW EMPLOYER THE OLD EMPLOYER WOULD BOUNCE OF CASH THAT SUDDENLY NEW MANAGEMENT STAFF FOR COMING IN DIRECTING THEIR WORK THEY HAD NO FOREWARNING THAT THESE CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP WERE OCCURRING UP UNTIL CHANGES IN THEIR SCHEDULE. HEY ON BENEFITS WERE PASSED DOWN WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEW EMPLOYER WE WOULD CONTACT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND FIND THAT THEY HADN'T BEEN NOTIFIED TO RECEIVE THE FULL APPLICATION YET. AND NO PRIOR NOTICE UP TO THIS POINT HAS BEEN REQUIRED FOR OPERATIONAL -- MORE MANAGEMENT OWNERSHIP CHANGES ARE HARD WON CONTRACTS WOULD SUDDENLY BE VOIDED WHICH OFFERS US LITTLE RECOURSE FOR SETTLING GRIEVANCES ARE NEGOTIATING WORKPLACE STANDARDSWORKERS WHO'VE BEEN AT FACILITIES FOR YEARS OR EVEN DECADES ARE TOLD LAST MINUTE TO REAPPLY FOR THEIR JOBS. RESIDENCY SITE AND TURN OVER IN THE DIRECT CARE STAFF SOME OF WHOM THEY MAY HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS AND IN THE WORST CASES FACILITIES GO YEARS WITHOUT THE OFFICIAL OPERATOR BEING ON THE BOOKS. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN -- THEY HAVEN'T UNDERGONE A VETTING PROCESS THE THE THE LICENSING PROCESS AND WHEN A PROBLEM OCCURS -- SURVEYORS RESIDENTS THEIR FAMILY MAN MEMBERS AND OTHER ADVOCATES ARE UNCLEAR WHO TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE AND THESE ARE JUST A SAMPLE OF SOME OF THE STORIES THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS OVER THE YEARS. AND SO AS A SOP TO SOME OF THE MORE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS OF SIDE AND COVERT OWNERSHIP CHANGES WE PROPOSED A FEW IMPROVEMENTS TO THIS PROCESS. WOULD LIKE MORE TRANSPARENCY AND NOTICE REGARDING WHO'S TAKING OVER FACILITY BY IMPLEMENTING A TIME LIMITED PRE APPROVAL PROCESS IN TAKING CARE TO CAPTURE SOME OF THE INTERIM -- MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE OTHER THIRD PARTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN WE ASK THAT THIS PROCESS -- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT A PROSPECTIVE OWNERS BUSINESS ORGANIZATION BRETT B. TATIAN AND CAPABILITY IN DELIVERING QUALITY CARE. AND WE ASK THAT THERE BE A SIXTY DAY RETENTION PERIOD TO ALLOW FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION AND CONTINUITY OF CARE TO OFFER WORKERS AND RESIDENTS TO PLAN AHEAD AND ANTICIPATE SOME OF THESE CHANGES -- SO WE WELCOME YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL TODAY I'M AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER NOW TO OUR MEMBER CLOUDY ACCOUNTS.

A MAN IN OTHER THINGS ARE NO LONGER -- GUARANTEED BY THE BY AIR IS CONCERNED WITH KEEPING THE COAST LOW. AND DOES NOT SEE THE VALUE OF NURSING HOME WORKERS IN DELIVERING SAFE AND QUALITY CARE FOR RESIDENTS -- GIVE ME I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT THESE THINGS HAPPEN RARELY BUT CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP OCCURS RIGHT OUT BUT REGARDLESS LEE -- REGULARLY REGARDLESS OF THE SIZE OF THE COMPANY. JUST RECENTLY A MEDIUM SIZED HELPER -- OPERATE OR EXPERIENCE THE FINANCIAL TROUBLE DECIDED TO TRANSFERRED THEIR OPERATIONS DESPITE WHAT THE EMPLOYER CLAIM THAT TRANSITION HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT OR BAR ORDERLY.

I AM A CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT AT THE NURSING HOME FACILITY LOCATED IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF SEIU. TWENTY FIFTEEN I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING TO PROTECT BOTH RESIDENTS OF NURSING HOME WORKERS WHEN THE FACILITY IS BEING SOLD TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. BUT A MERE STROKE OF LUCK. I HAVE EXPERIENCE THE TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP TWICE IN TWO YEARS IN THE AME FACILITY. THE FIRST ROUND OF SALE TRANSACTION WE WERE ASSURED THAT THERE WILL BE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION.

THE BUYER DECIDED TO SEAR OUT ARE EARNED SICK DAYS AMONG OTHER CHANGES TWO YEARS LATER WE ARE AGAIN UNDERGOING A TRANSFER OF OPERATIONS DUE TO FINANCIAL TROUBLES. WE HEARD THE SAME PROMISE ONLY THIS TIME IT IS WORSE. PAYROLL CHECK BOUNCERS INADEQUATE SUPPLY LIKE DIAPER FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND LOW STAFFING. OUR TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP STORY IS STILL UNFOLDING DESPITE WHAT THE EMPLOYER IS CLAIMING THAT TRANSITION HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT ORDERLY.

THANKING THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR -- FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT SHE'S OFFERING TODAY WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE MOVING. OUR POSITION TO NEUTRAL -- REMOVING OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I'M JUST LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS -- BASED ON THAT -- OPPOSITION REMOVAL A COUPLE THINGS IS I I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMITTEE KNOWS AND THE AUTHOR KNOWS HOW MUCH AND AND SHE'S HEARD THIS FROM US THAT HOW MUCH WE AGREE THAT -- THE CURRENT LICENSING PROCESS AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS FOR OF FACILITIES THAT ARE UNDER -- THE JURISDICTION APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS BROKEN -- CURRENTLY -- THE AVERAGE TIME IT TAKES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE A LICENSURE APPLICATION IS A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS. WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PENDING WITH THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW SOME HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR YEARS -- IT SHOULD NOT. IT SHOULD NOT BE THAT WAY -- AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A PROCESS WHEREBY -- A NEW A NEW OWNER NEEDS TO STEP IN BECAUSE YOU HAVE A FACILITY THAT STRUGGLING AND SO THEY START AS AN AN INTERIM MANAGER. AND THEN ENTER MANAGER THAN DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE MEDICAID FUNDS THAT COME THROUGH THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THOSE ARE STILL GOING TO THE PREVIOUS OWNER. SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A DELAY IN -- PAYCHECKS GOING OUT FUNDS BEING AVAILABLE -- AND I WOULD SAY ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE -- NURSING FACILITIES THAT ARE OVER YOU KNOW ALMOST 70% FUNDED BY THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE FOR THEIR FUNDED WELL ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND THE ADEQUATE -- SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED -- SO WE HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWO MAIN ANIMAL ELEMENTS OF THE BILL WHICH ALLOW FOR PRE NOTICE. AND ALSO -- ALLOW FOR RETENTION AND SO WE'VE BEEN -- PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON BOTH OF THOSE. ARE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN WAS THAT IF THE IF THE DEPARTMENT'S HELD TO A NINETY DAY APPROVAL PROCESS THEY WON'T BEAT IT WE HOPE THAT THEY DO -- BUT HISTORICALLY THEY HAVE NOT AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT THAT THAT'S BEEN TAKEN -- THAT ALLOWS FOR THE APPLICATION PROCESS THE CURRENT APPLICATION PROCESS TO GO THROUGH -- IF THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T MEET THEIR NINETY DAY APPROVAL -- TIME FRAME A WE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE -- SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE THE AUTHOR AND THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WELL THAT I KNOW THAT SENATOR STONE AND THE CHAIR ARE PART OF TO LOOKAT THIS PROCESS AND HELP US FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIX IT BECAUSE IT CAN'T GO FORWARD. THE WAY IT CURRENTLY IS SO AGAIN PRE SHAPED -- ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. THESE THREE TESTAMENT AND I'M SURE THE BUDGET CHAIR HERE'S A LOUD AND CLEAR AS WELL. AND THAT IS ARE THE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. I'M NOT HONORED A MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL. SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL MOVES THE BILL ANY FINAL COMMENTS -- THIS IS TO PASS TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS -- SOMETHING WRONG. THANK YOU -- MEDICARE. THIS IS A BILL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY CLEARLY IN SUPPORT OF THE WORKERS WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO ENSURING THAT THE MOST VULNERABLE ARE PROTECTED. AS WELL AS INSURING THAT THE RESIDENTS OF THESE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES I HAVE THE CONTINUITY OF CARE -- I'M REALLY THANKFUL FOR THE SPONSORS AS WELL AS TO THE OPPOSITION FOR IDENTIFYING THAT WE HAVE A RESOURCE PROBLEM. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW AS A STATE WITH A DOUBLE SENIOR MAJORITY BOTH. PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS NOW BEING SENIOR CITIZENS ACROSS THE STATE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THIS PROBLEM AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND I FELT WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND A PROBLEM COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION. I WILL GO AND CALL THE ROLL. HANDS DOWN STONE I'D CONSOLIDATE CONTROL AS I DROVE HER TADO LABOR MITCHELL. MITCHELLI MINING RUBIO THE THREE OF US REALLY THE REAL OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE WITNESSES ABOUT -- THE MONEY WHAT OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BE A FILE ITEM NINETEEN WE WELCOME ASSEMBLYWOMAN FLOWN AB? TWELVE FORTY SIX YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HUSTLIN. WELCOME FOR HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU HAVE A CERTAIN MEMBERS. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED AB TWELVE FORTY SIX CLOSES A GAP IN STATE LAW BY ENSURING CONSUMERS WITH LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ENJOY THE SAME HEALTH BENEFITS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS ALREADY HAVE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM ANALYSIS OF THIS BILL THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA'S INSURED BY LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS AS OTHER CALIFORNIANS WHOSE COVERAGE IS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED. HEALTHCARE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES LARGE GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY IS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO INCLUDE THE COVERAGE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND PROHIBITS ANNUAL OR LIFETIME DOLLAR LIMITS ON BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CONSUMERS WITH COVERAGE REGULATED UNDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED COVERAGE THAT PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE INCLUDING BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES SUCH AS DOCTOR SERVICES. HOSPITAL SERVICES EMERGENCY CARE LAB IMOGENE AND HOSPICE CARE THIS BILL CODIFIES THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS INTO THE INSURANCE CODE. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN EYE BUT WHEN THE TIME THANK YOU LISTEN HERE WITNESSES ON GOOD AFTERNOON AND JDS HERE FROM HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA PROUD TO SPONSOR A BEETLE FORTY SIX WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY LEVEL UP THE PLAYING FIELD TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS. WITH STATE REGULATED COVERAGE -- BENEFIT FROM THE SAME COMPLAINT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS REGARDLESS OF WHICH DEPARTMENT REGULATES THEIR COVERAGE. A B. TWELVE FORTY SIX WOULD PROTECT CONSUMERS WITH LARGE GROUP COVERAGE UNDER THE INSURANCE CODE BY CODIFYING KNOCKS KEEN ACT BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICES DEFINITIONS AND MEDICALLY NECESSARY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROTECTIONS INTO THE INSURANCE CODE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CODIFY THESE MINIMUM BENEFITS STANDARDS IN THE INSURANCE CODE BECAUSE UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL BLUE RULES WHICH CAN CHANGE LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE ONLY HAS TO MEET. MINIMUM VALUE THRESHOLDS MINIMUM VALUE COVERAGE A MINIMUM VALUE COVERAGE CAN CHANGE AND CAN INCLUDE MANY LIMITATIONS FOR EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE A HOSPITAL STAY CAN BE COVERED. BUT COVERAGE IS ONLY LIMITED TO THREE TO FIVE DAYS ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THAT COVERAGE CAN COVER DOCTOR VISITS BUT NOT HOSPITAL VISITS. THESE SCENARIOS CREATE GAPS IN BENEFITS AND PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIANS WITH LARGE EMPLOYER COVERAGE UNDER THE INSURANCE CODE VERSUS THOSE UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE -- WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE IN HELPING US WITH AMENDMENTS THAT STRIKE A BALANCE TO ENSURE OUR TO STATE-REGULATORS RETAINED EARTH ALREADY OVER THEIR AREAS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WORK COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER. FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT A B. TWELVE FORTY SIX AND ASK FOR YOUR I VOTE THANK YOU.

THESE AMENDMENTS ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF YOU NOW HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A COPY OF THEM. EXCELLENT AT CENTERS EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO WOULD REQUIRE HOSPITALS WITH OVER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE HOSPITAL SUPPLIER DIVERSITY AND EFFORTS TO INCREASE THAT DIVERSITY. THIS BILL WOULD NOT ESTABLISH QUOTAS IT ONLY ENCOURAGES HOSPITALS TO TAKE A DEEPER LOOK INTO OUR SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROCUREMENT EFFORTS. ARE SEEN AS ONE THAT TAKES PRIDE IN ITS DIVERSITY AND FOR THAT REASON WE MUST CONTINUE TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED. DIVERSE BUSINESSES PROVIDE NUMEROUS BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMON ECONOMIES ACCORDING TO THE U. S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 42% OF ALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE OR MINORITY OWNED. FURTHER MORE DIVERSE BUSINESSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO OPERATE A SMALL BUSINESSES AND HIRE PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS PROVIDING A PATHWAY TO FINANCIAL SECURITY.

OUR STATE CURRENTLY LACKS DATA ABOUT HOW HOSPITALS CONDUCT THEIR PROCUREMENT. AB NINETY TWO WILL ALLOW HEALTHCARE BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS TO LEVERAGE THE GROWTH OF THE HEALTH SECTOR TO BENEFIT DIVERSE BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. BUT SEVERAL EXAMPLES ACROSS THE STATE THAT INDICATE THAT SUPPLIER DIVERSITY REPORTING WILL INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES IN CAPITAL FOR DIVERSE BUSINESSES.
