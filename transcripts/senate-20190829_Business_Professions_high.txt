DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE ONE BILL ON OUR FILE TODAY AT ONE OF THE BUT OF THE AUTHOR SENATOR GROVE THIS IS. AS J. R. TWELVE INTRODUCED ON AUGUST FOURTEENTH SO. DECISION THAT HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER IN OUR YEAR WE WELCOME YOU TO PRESENT YOUR YOUR BILL. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I PERSONALLY LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PULLING THIS COMMITTEE TOGETHER I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND MAKING THIS HAPPEN. IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE REPRESENT MY DISTRICT IS THE FIRST WE HAVE THE ONE TWO AND THREE AGRICULTURE COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE NATION. WE FRESNO TULARE AND KERN OBVIOUSLY PRODUCE MORE AGRICULTURE THAN ANY OTHER STE A COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE NATION SO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. SO OBVIOUSLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US AS CHAIR TWELVE CALLS ON CONGRESS AND TO RATIFY THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO CANADA AGREEMENT KNOWN AS THE US MCA. THIS AGREEMENT BUILDS ON THE TENETS OF THE FORMER. TRYING NATIONAL AGREEMENT KNOWN AS NAFTA IN ITS EXISTING PROTECTIONS FOR AMERICAN BUSINESS AND POLITICAL PROPERTIES ACTUALLY INCREASE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE YEAR THAT NAFTA'S RATIFICATION AGRICULTURE EXPORTS HAS QUADRUPLES FROM NINE BILLION TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORTS FROM CALIFORNIA. MY SENATE DISTRICT LIKE I SAID HAS THE ONE TWO AND THREE TOP COUNTIES IN THE NATION FOR AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION. AND OVERALL CALIFORNIA EXPORTED MORE THAN THIRTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PRODUCTS TO OUR SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR AND SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS INTO OUR NORTHERN FOR. THESE COUNTIES COMBINED MAKE UP ABOUT 28% CALIFORNIA'S TOP EXPORTS. WITH THE ADOPTION OF THE USMC CALIFORNIA ALONE IS EXPECTED INCREASED KIT EXPORTS TO CANADA AND MEXICO BI FIVE POINT 9% AND SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT. RESPECTIVELY THESE INCREASE EXPORTS WILL INCREASE NEARLY THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN EXPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE CREATION OF JOBS MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER STATES HAVE ON THE PASS MILLER RESOLUTIONS CALLING ON CONGRESS TO RATIFY THE U. S. MCA. THIS COMMITTEE ITSELF JUST IT BACK JULY VOTED ON S. R. FORTY EIGHT BY SENATOR HUESO AND IT WAS SIMILAR IN THE FACT TO S. YEAR TWELVE BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZED. MEXICO AS A KEY TRADE PARTNER TO ENCOURAGE THE. IT STATES TO MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AT A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH ART SOUTHERN NEIGHBOR. S. YOUR TWELVE GOES FOR FARTHER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR OF CANADA AND WE THINK THERE AND EQUALLY IMPORTANT TRADING PARTNER. CONGRESS IS POISED TO TAKE UP THE US MCA AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER SEVERAL OTHER STATES HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED THIS. MEXICO'S PRESIDENT THE PRESENT UNITED STATES AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO THIS AGREEMENT. MEXICO HAS ADOPTED THIS AGREEMENT AND WE NEED THE OTHER TWO PARTICIPANTS TO TAKE PLACE AND I WOULD JUST LIKE CALIFORNIA TO ENCOURAGE OUR CONGRESS TO DO SO. THAT'LL TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY I'M UP LATE PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE HEARINGS OF THE SECTOR WOULD CALL THAT.
