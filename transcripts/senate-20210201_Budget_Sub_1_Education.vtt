00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:13.326

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.200
NINE BILL. IN IN THE TWENTY TWO

ESTIMATES FROM LAST YEAR. BY A

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.806
VERY WIDE MARGIN THAT'S A LARGE

MAN YOU'RE- IN THE HISTORY

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:46.544
THE NEW PROPOSALS IN THIS

00:25:46.611 --> 00:25:47.946
YEAR'S BUDGET ARE RELATED TO

00:25:48.013 --> 00:25:49.247
MEETING THAT HIGHER GUARANTEED

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:54.119
IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY. THAT

00:25:54.185 --> 00:25:56.121
GROWTH CONTINUES IN TWENTY ONE

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:56.755
TWENTY TWO. THE GUARANTEE AND-

00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:57.956
BY A DENTIST THREE. OVER THERE

00:25:58.023 --> 00:26:00.392
OF. TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ABOVE

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:01.893
HIGHER CHEN FUND UP. AND GROWTH

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.028
AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE

00:26:03.094 --> 00:26:04.996
CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. IN

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.498
ADDITION AS THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:26:06.564 --> 00:26:07.732
FINANCE MENTIONED THERE'S A TWO

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:09.434
POINT THREE BILLION. A PROPOSED

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:11.136
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ON TOP OF

00:26:11.202 --> 00:26:14.739
THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED.

00:26:14.806 --> 00:26:17.976
ALL THE OF FINANCE MEANT THAT

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:19.611
BILLION PROPERTY NINETY EIGHT

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:20.912
RESERVE DEPOSIT AND THAT IS

00:26:20.979 --> 00:26:22.781
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT TRIGGERS

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:23.782
A CAP ON SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.017
RESERVES STARTING IN TWENTY TWO

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:28.186
TWENTY THREE. THAT CAP IS EQUAL

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.921
210% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.523
ANNUAL EXPENDITURE IT IS.

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:32.824
BECAUSE THE CAPPING SOUNDS

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:34.459
DISTRICTS OF TWENTY FIVE

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:35.927
HUNDRED OR FEWER STUDENTS THE

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:37.028
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:26:37.095 --> 00:26:40.465
THE STATE ARE ACTUALLY ALREADY

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.099
EXEMPT FROM THE CAP. BUT BASED

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.267
ON THE DATA THAT WE HAVE THE

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:43.568
LATEST DATA FROM EIGHTEEN

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:45.403
NINETEEN. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT A

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.271
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEDIUM AND

00:26:46.338 --> 00:26:48.106
LARGE DISTRICTS OF RESERVES

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:50.308
THAT EXCEED THE 10% CAP.

00:26:50.375 --> 00:26:51.743
DISTRICTSMIGHT RESPOND TO THIS

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.511
CAPEN VARIOUS WAYS THEY CAN BE

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.481
CLASSIFIED TO RESERVES TO AVOID

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.350
TO CAP. OR THEY COULD. YOU CAN

00:26:58.416 --> 00:26:59.684
EXEMPTION FROM THE COUNTY

00:26:59.751 --> 00:27:01.720
OFFICES OFFICES OF EDUCATION WE

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.121
THINK THOSE TWO APPROACHES ARE

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:05.023
PROBABLY WHAT MOST DISTRICTS

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.391
WILL DO. ALTERNATIVELY THOUGH

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.625
THEY COULD CHOOSE TO SPEND DOWN

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:12.030
RESEARCH. AS FAR AS THE

00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:13.131
ESTIMATES OF THE I THINK THE

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:14.766
GUY THE ADMINISTRATION PUT

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.668
FORWARD IT WAS THE MOST POINT.

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:19.204
OVER THE YEAR PERIOD.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.438
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ESTIMATES

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:22.440
ARE VERY TO OUR IS IN TWO BOTH

00:27:22.507 --> 00:27:24.109
TERMS OF GENERAL REVENUE. ON

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.077
THE PROPERTY TAX. OTHER

00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:26.878
ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.580
GUARANTEE I JUST FOUR HUNDRED

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:30.482
MILLION ABOUT BARS OVER THE

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:31.783
ENTIRE THREE YEAR BUDGET. SO

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:35.754
VERY COSTARS. THANK YOU IN A

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.688
SIGNIFICAN ECONOMIC ANSWER.

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:38.156
THIS BASE RIGHT NOW WE ARE

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:40.225
EXPECTING. TO SEE AT LEAST SOME

00:27:40.291 --> 00:27:42.861
CHANGES IN REVENUE- BY NAY.

00:27:42.927 --> 00:27:44.696
THOSE CHANGES BECAUSE TRUST

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:46.031
FUND IS OPERATIVE WOULD ALSO

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:48.466
AFFECT CARE AND- BUT

00:27:48.533 --> 00:27:49.334
SURPRISINGLY THOSE CHANGES IN

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:51.002
THE GUARANTEED MIGHT NOT MEAN

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.203
MORE OR LESS FUNDING IS

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.838
AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOLS. THE

00:27:53.905 --> 00:27:55.340
EXTENT TO GUARANTEE IS HIGHER

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:56.374
LIKELY THE STATE WILL HAVE TO

00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:58.309
MAKE A LARGER DEPOSIT INTO THE

00:27:58.376 --> 00:27:58.977
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:27:59.044 --> 00:28:00.745
RESERVES. AND TO THE EXTENT THE

00:28:00.812 --> 00:28:02.747
GUARANTEE IS LOWER. THE STATE

00:28:02.814 --> 00:28:04.549
IS LIKELY GOING TO BE ABLE TO

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:05.316
ACCOMMODATE AT LEAST SOME OF

00:28:05.383 --> 00:28:07.185
THAT DROPPED. BY MAKING A

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.620
SMALLER DEPOSITS INTO THE

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:14.192
PROPOSITION AND THE RESEARCH.

00:28:14.259 --> 00:28:16.294
ADMINISTRATION ONE ST SOME PAY.

00:28:16.361 --> 00:28:17.962
AND WE THAT'S WHERE. UNDER THE

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.630
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MINIMUM CARE.

00:28:18.696 --> 00:28:21.132
AS ARE COVERED GROUND THAT IT

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:24.736
HAD LOST LAST YEAR. AND BARRING

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:25.804
ANOTHER RECESSION IT LOOKS LIKE

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.639
GROWTH THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE

00:28:27.705 --> 00:28:29.474
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BE.

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.075
ENOUGH TO NOT ONLY COVER THE

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.543
COST OF AT BUT I SOME OTHER

00:28:31.609 --> 00:28:33.478
AGREED TO. ANOTHER

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.313
CONSIDERATION WHICH IS PERHAPS

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.448
AN EVEN BIGGER ISSUE FOR THE

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:38.616
FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE IS WELL

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:39.150
THAT THE STATE IS FACED A

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.051
GROWING OPERATING DEFICIT ON

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:41.820
THE NON. JUST NINETY EIGHT OF

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:44.322
THE BUT- UNDER THE ADMIN. FOR

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:45.557
THAT DEATH IS GROWS TO NEARLY A

00:28:45.623 --> 00:28:51.029
LOT BILLION BY. FOUR TWENTY

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:51.529
FIVE. ABSENT CHANGES THE

00:28:51.596 --> 00:28:52.263
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT THAT

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:54.666
DOUBLES WOULD GO TO NEARLY

00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:56.267
SEVEN BUILD WALLS. SO THE

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.369
SUPPLEMENT PAYMENT CHANGES. I

00:28:58.436 --> 00:28:59.270
DON'T DELIVER THAT DAY. BUT

00:28:59.337 --> 00:28:59.871
THEY DO MAKE A LITTLE BIT YOU

00:28:59.938 --> 00:29:06.778
TO DO LESS. A SHIFT THIS SPEND

00:29:06.845 --> 00:29:08.413
PROPOSED. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

BILLION YEN NEW PROPER NINETY

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.383
SPENDING. I THINK YOU'VE

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:13.284
ALREADY COVER IN THE MID OF THE

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:14.719
MOVING TO. OF THAT NINETEEN

BILLION IS THE ONE TIME. IN TWO

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.824
POINT SIX BILLION IS FOR ON

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:26.598
OBJECTIONS WISELY. JUST ONCE.

00:29:26.664 --> 00:29:27.198
WHAT WHAT OTHER ISSUE THE ON

00:29:27.265 --> 00:29:28.967
YOUR IS PENSIONS. SCHOOLS AND

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:30.502

00:29:35.907 --> 00:29:37.976
FOR ONE TIME. AT LEAST. SPREAD

00:29:38.042 --> 00:29:40.545
ROUGHLY. OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:42.147
AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AT

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.181
THE STATE ESSENTIALLY BY DOWN

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:44.649
COST THE DISTRICTS WOULD

00:29:44.716 --> 00:29:45.917
OTHERWISE HAVE PAID OUT OF

00:29:45.984 --> 00:29:47.485
THEIR LOCAL OPERATING BUDGETS

00:29:47.552 --> 00:29:51.856
THOSE TO YEARS. OKAY AHEAD TO

TWENTY ONE TO TWO. DISTRICTS

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.224
ARE LIKELY TO FACE AN INCREASE

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.425
OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:55.960
DOLLARS POTENTIALLY AS MUCH AS

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.428
HALF A BILLION DOLLARS. THE

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.063
INCREASE IS PROJECTED TO BE

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.065
MUCH LARGER THAN TWENTY TO

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:01.766
TWENTY THREE LIKELY SOMETHING

00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.401
CLOSER TO ONE POINT SIX BILLION

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.270
DOLLARS. AND THAT'S LARGELY THE

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:05.904
RESULT OF THAT ONE TIME

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:11.743
FUNDING- EXPIRING IN TWENTY TWO

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:12.310
TWENTY THREE. ALSO TRYING TO

00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:13.645
RSS I THINK ONE KEY ASPECT OF

00:30:13.711 --> 00:30:15.446
THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT CONTAINS

00:30:15.513 --> 00:30:17.348
A LARGE ONE TIME QUESTION. OF

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:18.283
THE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:20.185
ATTRIBUTABLE TO TWENTY ONE

00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.085
TWENTY TWO A LITTLE OVER FIVE

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:21.953
BILLION HISTORY ONE TIME

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.588
ACTIVITIES. AND THAT'S

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:24.989
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT ONE TIME

00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.324
QUESTION I GIVE YOU A LITTLE

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:28.259
BIT OF PROTECTION. AGAINST

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:30.395
ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY REDUCES

00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:31.229
THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU MIGHT

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.997
HAVE TO CUT. I'M GOING PROGRAMS

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:34.399
IS TO GUARANTEE DROPS EITHER

00:30:34.465 --> 00:30:36.067
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS

00:30:36.134 --> 00:30:39.003
OR POTENTIALLY WITHIN THE NEXT

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.072
YEAR TO. ON THE ACT OF PROPOSED

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.640
THE FOR POINTS TO BILLION. I

00:30:42.707 --> 00:30:44.142
WOULD SUGGEST A SMALLER MORE

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.711
TRADED. APPROACH WILL BE

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:48.313
COVERING THAT. WHAT WILL HAPPEN

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.081
THE NEXT A PANEL OF THE LATE ON

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:53.785
SO ST MICHAEL ON THE- WE ALSO

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.954
WOULD SIX YOU CONSIDER IF YOU

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.622
WERE A NEW AND- THIS BUDGET HAS

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.257
AROUND TWO DOZEN. THE NEW

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:00.758
PRICKLE ACROSS SCHOOLS AND

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:02.660
COMMUNITY COLLEGES COMBINED.

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:03.895
BUT WE DO THINK SOME OF THOSE

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:06.297
PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE. BUT

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.799
OUR CONCERN IS THAT DOING ALL

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:09.067
OF THOSE PROPOSALS IN THE

00:31:09.133 --> 00:31:10.368
MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC MIGHT

00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:11.970
DILUTE THEIR INDIVIDUAL IMPACT

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:13.538
AND RISK SHIFTING ATTENTION

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:16.741
AWAY FROM. OTHER RESTORATIONS

00:31:16.808 --> 00:31:18.476
COURT PROGRAMS. FINALLY WE

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:19.777
RECOMMEND ALLOCATING MORE

00:31:19.844 --> 00:31:20.645
FUNDING FOR PAYING DOWN

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:22.480
DEFERRALS IN ADDRESSING PENSION

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.582
COSTS. CAN DOWN DEFERRALS WOULD

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:27.285
HELP- THE STATE'S. GET THE

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:28.686
PROPOSITION EIGHT BUDGET BACK

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.121
IN BALANCE THAT WOULD REALIGN

00:31:30.188 --> 00:31:32.190
PROGRAMS WITH THE ON GOING

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:33.524
FUNDING THAT IS FOR THOSE

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:36.027
PROGRAMS. WE ALSO THANK THE

00:31:36.094 --> 00:31:37.328
LEGISLATURE COULD USE ONE TIME

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:38.696
FUNDING TO SMOOTH OUT THE LARGE

00:31:38.763 --> 00:31:40.331
INCREASE IN PENSION COSTS THAT

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:43.368
ARE. PROJECTED FOR TWENTY TWO

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:44.068
TWENTY THREE FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:45.703
STATE COULD SET ASIDE EIGHT

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:46.304
HUNDRED MILLION NOW ON A ONE

00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:48.473
TIME BASIS. AND USE THAT TO

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:51.609
PROVIDE A MUCH MORE. GRADUAL

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.144
RAMP UP ATTENTION COST OVER THE

00:31:53.211 --> 00:31:55.546
NEXT COUPLE YEARS. WE THINK THE

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:56.581
STATE COULD ALSO THINK ABOUT.

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:58.783
PAYING DOWN UNFUNDED. PENSION

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.451
LIABILITIES WHICH WOULD REDUCE

00:32:00.518 --> 00:32:03.254
DISTRICT COST OVER A MUCH

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.290
LONGER PERIOD. YES I CAN OUR

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:06.991
COMMENTS ON THE BUDGET DANCE

00:32:07.058 --> 00:32:10.261
ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:13.197
MUCH- HOWEVER OF QUESTIONS TO

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.266
JUST DRAW OUT SOME OF THE

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.934
SUBJECTS THAT YOU WERE TALKING

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:19.737
ABOUT AND THE FIRST ONE WILL

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:22.073
START WITH A FINANCE- YOU

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.442
ALLUDED TO IT BUT A GIVEN THE

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:26.577
ONE TIME RESOURCES AVAILABLE

00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:29.881
WHY DID DO NOT RECOMMEND FULLY

00:32:29.947 --> 00:32:32.750
PAYING OFF THE DIFFERENCE.

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.851
RIGHT AND AGAIN AREA DEPARTMENT

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:36.754
OF FINANCE- DOESN'T OF FAIR

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.524
QUESTION CERTAINLY SO I THINK.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.592
I WOULD I WOULD. THANKS TO ME I

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:42.727
KIND OF HAVE TO BACK UP A

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.362
LITTLE BIT TO KIND OF A HIGHER

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.363
LEVEL WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:46.531
BUDGET PLANNING WHAT WE'RE

00:32:46.597 --> 00:32:48.066
WORKING WITH AND- BUT

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.401
SIGNIFICANT YES THE INCREASE OF

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:51.102
FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.438
DOLLARS. OR SEVENTEEN POINT TWO

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:55.106
INCLUDING THE- THE

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.475
SUPPLEMENTARY PAYMENT ON TOP OF

00:32:57.542 --> 00:32:58.943
THE ENACTED TWENTY TWENTY ONE

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.346
LEVELS BUT A HUGE PORTION OF

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.081
THAT RIGHT HAS TO GO TOWARDS

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:04.615
PAYING DOWN THE DEFERRALS AND

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.617
SO DOES LIMIT IN SOME SENSE OF.

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:09.253
HOW MUCH- IN NEW MONEY AS IT

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.089
WERE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO

00:33:11.155 --> 00:33:12.023
DO BUDGET WITH BECAUSE WE JUST

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:14.058
NEED TO GET. AT LEAST KIND OF

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:16.594
BACK TO THE BASELINE RIGHT

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:18.096
WITHOUT THOSE DEFERRALS AND SO

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.397
THAT'S KIND OF HOW I THINK OF

00:33:19.464 --> 00:33:23.835
IT AS A SORT OF A STEP. ONE-

00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:26.537
AND THEN. MARRYING THAT OF.

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.272
WITH THE GETTING GETTING BACK

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.241
TO THE DAY. I MEAN. WITH ALSO

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:31.275
TO MAX THE AMOUNT RESOURCES

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:33.511
THAT WE CAN GET OUT TO ELEAZAR.

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:35.213
IN REAL TIME NOW WHEN YOU SEE

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.414
THAT THROUGH THE SIX POINT SIX

00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:37.648
BILLION IN THE IMMEDIATE ACTION

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.984
ON OUR EARLY ACCESS PROPOSALS.

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:41.185
TO REALLY TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE-

00:33:41.252 --> 00:33:42.420
LIKE YOU SAID THE AMOUNT OF

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.688
RESOURCE DIGNITARIES NOW TO

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:45.256
RESPOND WITH THE PANDEMIC TO BE

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.358
ABLE TO- RE OPENED SAFELY WHEN

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:48.960
APPROPRIATE TO BE ABLE TO.

00:33:49.026 --> 00:33:50.094
BRIDGE THE GAP THAT MANY

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:51.162
STUDENTS ARE FEELING AND

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:53.531
LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE STATE-

00:33:53.598 --> 00:33:55.767
WHILE ALSO- AS ELIO POINTED OUT

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.835
MANAGING THAT CUSHION AS WELL

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.637
OF ONE TIME. VERSUS ONGOING

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:02.273
SPENDING PROPOSALS AND SO- THAT

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.442
IS WHY WE LANDED ON THE- ALSO

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:05.676
HAVING THE DEFERRAL SO WE ARE

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.578
FULLY RETIRING ELEVEN BILLION

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:08.646
THAN CREATING A NEW TO. A NEW

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.782
SMALLER TO FOR ALL OF THE THREE

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.582
POINT SEVEN BILLION WE FELT

00:34:11.649 --> 00:34:13.951
THAT THAT WAS. GIVEN THE

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:15.153
CUSHION THAT WE HAVE IN THE

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.554
BUDGET YEAR TO SOME EXTENT

00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:18.322
BETWEEN ONE TIME AND ONGOING TO

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.724
WHERE. I'VE REVENUES WERE TO

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.359
DROP IS ONLY A MENTION OF

00:34:21.426 --> 00:34:25.530
BETWEEN- THE- DEEPER MANY

00:34:25.596 --> 00:34:26.864
RESERVE DEPOSITS AND OTHER

00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.833
PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE- IT

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.201
WOULD NOT NECESSARILY MEAN AN

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.270
IMMEDIATE CUT. TO WHAT WE HAVE

00:34:32.336 --> 00:34:33.337
IN THE BUDGET RIGHT NOW

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:34.105
DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:34:34.172 --> 00:34:36.307
THAT DECLINE- AND SO WE FELT

00:34:36.374 --> 00:34:38.176
THAT IT WAS MOST PRUDENT TO

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:40.111
STRUCTURE IT IN THIS WAY. LIKE

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:41.512
I SAID TO REALLY MAXIMIZE.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:44.182
IMMEDIATE RESOURCES- AND THEN

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:46.250
ALSO GET- AT LEAST BACK TO A

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:48.252
MORE SIX STABILIZE TRAJECTORY

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:50.555
THAN THEY OTHERWISE. WOULD HAVE

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.189
BEEN IN AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:53.124
THAT THE- THE DEFERRAL AND THE

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:54.492
PRESIDENT OF THE THREE POINT

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.160
SEVEN AND NOT. JUST AN ESTIMATE

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:58.229
BY- OR INTENT IN THERE IS THAT

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.197
THAT WOULD BE WHAT'S CALLED A

00:34:59.263 --> 00:35:01.699
JUNE TO JULY DEFERRAL AT THE

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:03.134
END OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY

00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:05.770
TWO FISCAL YEAR- AND TYPICALLY

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:07.672
THOSE ARE- AND I DON'T THE I

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.207
DON'T DOWN PLAY IT TOO MUCH I

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:12.410
DON'T WORK AT DALY LEVELED- AS

00:35:12.477 --> 00:35:13.845
FAR AS I UNDER. IT BELIEVE MIKE

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:15.480
FIVE WITH WILL DISCUSSES THE ON

00:35:15.546 --> 00:35:18.382
THAT TENDS TO. LESS IN. ON A

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:20.251
CASH FLOW BASIS. GIVEN THAT

00:35:20.318 --> 00:35:21.285
IT'S A DEFERRAL OF JUST REALLY

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:30.561
A MATTER. OF WEEKS- THAT AND

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.029
WHEN WE HAVE THESE Mà.

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:34.365
FEBRUARY TWO NOVEMBER X. BEING

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:35.633
TO FOR. YOU KNOW CASH FOR

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.035
MONTHS MONTHS- SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:43.207
MY OF FOR. IT TO QUESTION.

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:45.243
HOPEFUL I'M NOT GOING TO WITH

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:49.914
FOR FREE AND NOW. OF THE LET ME

00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:51.616
ASK A FULL OF COURSE A YEAR

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:53.551
CIRCUM. USUALLY ABOUT ANYTHING

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:56.053
TO THE MEASURE BUT WATCHED SAY.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.021
FEDERAL FUNDS COME FOR

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:59.156
HEALTHCARE AND YOU MAY TAKE TO

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:00.758
BUILD DOLLAR DEAD YOU THINK

00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.126
WOULD GO TO TEST IT DISSED. BY

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:04.962
FED STATE FUNDS IN SOME WAY ARE

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:07.164
ON HEALTHCARE. BARR AND IT

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:09.133
FREES UP ONE TIME MONIES WOULD

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.168
THIS BE NEAR THE TOP OF YOUR

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.904
LIST OF SOMETHING TO BUY OUT IN

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.505
THE MAY REVISED TO JUST TRY TO

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:15.973
GET IT DONE BECAUSE THEY DID

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.408
HAVE EXPERIENCE AS A BUDGET

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:19.010
CHAIR WERE. WHERE PEOPLE WERE

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:20.378
GOING TO ONE TIME DEBTS THAT

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:22.446
ENDED UP LASTING FOREVER AND SO

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.649
I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT'S A

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:28.185
PRIORITY. FOR WHEN YOU LOOK AT-

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:30.354
THINGS IN MAY. YEAH WELL I

00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:33.424
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF.

00:36:33.491 --> 00:36:35.293
QUESTIONS WITH WITH IN THAT

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.563
BUT- BOTTOM LINE TO ANSWER YOUR

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:39.664
QUESTION ABOUT IF IT'S A

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:40.798
PRIORITY I THINK AT THAT POINT

00:36:40.865 --> 00:36:42.700
IN THE YEAR- THERE'S ALSO THE

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:44.435
QUESTION OF STATE CASH FLOW AND

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.937
WHAT HEALTH IS THERE- SO I

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:47.338
THINK IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:48.539
A QUESTION OF FEDERAL FUNDS

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.740
COMING IN BUT ALSO WHAT'S THE

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.042
STATE OF THE GENERAL FUND

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:52.643
REVENUE AND THE AND THE GENERAL

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.379
FUND. CASH FLOW PICTURE- AND

00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.581
AGAIN BY THE TIME ME COMES

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:58.416
AROUND- THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE

00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.750
MORE MONTH OF APPORTIONMENT

00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:02.219
SITTING THERE AND SO- YOU

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:03.487
REALLY JUST BE TALKING ABOUT

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:05.356
YOU'D POTENTIALLY RESTRUCTURING

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:06.691
THAT END OF THIS YEAR JUNE TO

00:37:06.757 --> 00:37:08.726
JULY DEFERRAL- AND WE WOULD

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.161
PROBABLY HAVE SOME PAUSE

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:11.862
BECAUSE ANOTHER THING THAT I

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.130
DIDN'T ANSWER OR DIDN'T GET TO

00:37:13.197 --> 00:37:15.299
IN MY PREVIOUS ANSWER IS- WITH

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.168
ELLIE MANY ELEAZAR APPLYING FOR

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:21.505
A TRAN- DO YOU HAVE FINANCIAL

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.340
ASSISTANCE DURING THIS TIME

00:37:22.406 --> 00:37:25.042
ALONE- IF. WE WERE TO CHANGE

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:27.078
THE SCHEDULE UP ON THEM- IN THE

00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:29.280
MEANTIME MANY OF THEM THEY'RE

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.147
THEY'RE APPLYING FOR SEVERAL

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:32.183
MONTHS AT ONCE- ALREADY RIGHT

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.150
NOW AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:34.185
GETTING APPROVED HERE IF THEY

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:35.419
HAVEN'T ALREADY HERE IN IN THE

00:37:35.486 --> 00:37:36.988
FIRST COUPLE WEEKS OF FEBRUARY

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:40.157
AND SO- BUT TO CHANGE UP HOW

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:42.159
THAT STRUCTURE WOULD WORK AND-

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:43.828
DID NOT END UP DEFERRING SOME

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:45.763
OF THOSE MONIES WOULD. RESULT

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.531
IN POTENTIALLY- FEDERAL

00:37:47.598 --> 00:37:49.700
PENALTIES THERE'S BASED ON THE

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.603
TAX STATUS OF THOSE LOANS AND

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.138
SO WE'RE A LITTLE HESITANT TO

00:37:54.205 --> 00:37:56.207
GO TOO FAR DOWN THAT ROAD- BUT

00:37:56.273 --> 00:37:58.109
I THINK- THAT'S FOR THE CURRENT

00:37:58.175 --> 00:37:59.276
YEAR DEFERRALS I THINK WHEN IT

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:02.246
COMES TO THAT THE DEFERRAL

00:38:02.313 --> 00:38:04.181
421-222-2220 THREE- I THINK

00:38:04.248 --> 00:38:06.617
CERTAINLY IF A SITUATION AROSE

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:09.120
WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO- SHORTEN

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:11.155
THAT DEFERRAL- YEAH. REDUCE THE

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.124
SIZE THAT TO FOR ALL I THINK WE

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.192
WOULD BE OPEN TO PRIORITIZING

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.761
THAT AS LONG AS WE CAN STILL

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:17.495
LIKE I SAID MAXIMIZE ALL THE

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.130
OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE'RE

00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:28.005
REALLY TRYING. TO MAXIMIZE. I

00:38:28.072 --> 00:38:29.373
APPRECIATE ANSWER JUST IN IN

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.209
THE IN THE- OUT IN THE YEAR OF

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:33.477
THE FOR BUDGET THAT'S- IF MAKE

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:35.179
TOTAL TO NOT RUN UP THE DAY.

00:38:35.246 --> 00:38:36.781
BECAUSE ANY TIME. A DISTRICT

00:38:36.847 --> 00:38:38.349
THE BALL OR DO A TRAIN ONE OF

00:38:38.416 --> 00:38:39.417
THE THINGS PICKING THE IN IN

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.918
MANY Y. FOR WHAT THE STATE IS

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.253
DOING IN TERMS OF THE DEFERRAL

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:43.954
SO THE SOONER THAT WE CAN BUY

00:38:44.021 --> 00:38:46.123
IT OUT IN THE NEXT YEAR. OF THE

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.192
BETTER IT IS I HAVE ONE MORE

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.361
QUESTION AND MAYBE I'LL START

00:38:50.428 --> 00:38:51.996
WITH THELA- EVEN THOUGH IT

00:38:52.063 --> 00:38:54.065
WOULD FIT WITH BOTH OF YOU. AND

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:55.833
THAT IS A SINCE I WAS LAST IN

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.468
THE LEGISLATURE PROPOSITION TWO

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.503
PASSED AND IT WAS MENTIONED IN

00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.505
YOUR PRESENTATIONS THAT THE-

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:02.840
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

00:39:02.907 --> 00:39:06.477
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT- IS HERE.

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:08.479
AND MONEY IS BEING SWEPT INTO

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:10.948
IT- IN THIS BUDGET MAYBE IF YOU

00:39:11.015 --> 00:39:12.483
COULD TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT IF

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.351
THERE'S ANYTHING IN THAT US

00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:17.254
FAR. WHAT IF THE CURRENT TRENDS

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.222
WITH WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:20.458
CONTINUE HOW MUCH WILL BE IN

00:39:20.524 --> 00:39:23.060
THERE AND- I THINK THAT. NOBODY

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:24.595
THOUGHT THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:25.629
THIS SOON AND NOW IT'S

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:30.234
HAPPENING AND IT'S ID AND. IF

00:39:30.301 --> 00:39:31.235
YOU JUST REMIND OUR LISTENERS.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:33.304
WHAT THE CITY. IS TO ALLOW YOU

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.538
TO GO INTO THE RESERVE AT ANY

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.173
TIME SO IT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.641
THE STATE OF THE RESERVE BEFORE

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:40.745
THIS YEAR. OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.680
THIS LIKE AN- HOUR WHAT WOULD

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:44.081
IT TAKE IS JUST THE START OF A

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:45.950
TREND IN FUTURE YEARS THAT A

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:47.384
LOT MORE WILL GO IN OF REVENUES

00:39:47.451 --> 00:39:49.653
CONTINUE IT AT THIS WAY. I JUST

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.521
WAS LOOKING FOR A BRIEF

00:39:50.588 --> 00:39:54.258
OVERVIEW SO THAT. WE CAN BRING

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:55.126
EVERYBODY ALONG ON THIS. YEAH I

00:39:55.192 --> 00:39:56.460
THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO THAT

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.928
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.897
RESERVE WAS ADDED BY OPPOSITION

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:02.066
TO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND THE

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:05.202
THEORY BEHIND THIS. PROPOSITION

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:05.803
NINETY RESERVE AS WELL AS THE

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.172
STATE'S- BROADER RESERVE THE

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.007
BUDGET STATE. ACCOUNT IS THAT

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.976
IT WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.678
UNEXPECTED. SURGES IN ONE TIME

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.881
REVENUE. AND SO ONE OF THE

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.415
REASONS THAT THESE RESERVE

00:40:18.482 --> 00:40:19.917
DEPOSIT SEEM LIKE THEY ALWAYS

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:22.086
SNEAK UP ON US IS THAT. THAT

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.788
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE RESERVE

00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:24.889
DEPOSIT IS DESIGNED TO PICK UP

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:26.490
ITS ONE REVENUE INCREASES IN A

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:27.258
WAY THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:28.726
ANTICIPATE IN A BASELINE

00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.861
FORECAST. THE FORMULAS REQUIRED

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.097
US TO SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING

00:40:33.164 --> 00:40:34.331
INDUSTRIES- EVENT IN THIS CASE

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.567
THE UNEXPECTED FACTORS THE-

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:37.935
STRONGER CAPITAL GAINS MUCH

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:40.137
STRONGER STOCK MARKET THAN. ANY

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:45.042
OF US ANTICIPATED. LAST SUMMER.

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:48.179
THE PROPOSITION TO WHAT THIS

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.713
SPECIAL PROVISION THAT SAID NO

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.216
TO PA. INTO THERE WAS COULD IN

00:40:52.283 --> 00:40:55.419
TWO HERE AND- ADD- HE WAS GONNA

00:40:55.486 --> 00:40:58.322
COME FOR BUT AS THAT YOU'RE HAD

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:00.925
SURPASS. THREE GREATEST LEVELS

00:41:00.991 --> 00:41:02.259
ADJUSTED INFLATION AND IT TOOK

00:41:02.326 --> 00:41:03.327
A NUMBER OF SAID THAT TO HAPPEN

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:04.995
SO THEY WERE. UP FOR OR FIVE

00:41:05.062 --> 00:41:06.497
YEARS THE NAY PASSED WITH

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:13.838
DEPOSITS WERE. BUT AHEAD TO-

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.105
FROM THIS POINT I THINK I JUST

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:18.075
DEVICE VERY LIKE ARE POSSIBLE

00:41:18.142 --> 00:41:19.510
THE ADMINISTRATION- THEIR MULTI

00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:20.578
YEAR- OUTLOOK AS THE

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.745
PROPOSITION BALANCE NOT

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.814
PROPOSITION NINETY A GOOD. A

00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:24.748
GROWING TO THREE BILL BY THE

00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.850
END OF ONE TO TWO THEN STAY

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:26.617
ROUGHLY AT THREE BILLION OF THE

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:28.519
NEXT COUPLE YEARS BUT AGAIN IN

00:41:28.586 --> 00:41:30.321
A- GIVEN THE KIND OF FACTORS

00:41:30.387 --> 00:41:32.156
THAT FEED INTO THAT CALCULATION

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.257
IT COULD EASILY BE MUCH LARGER

00:41:33.324 --> 00:41:34.692
MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT OVER THE

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:38.462
NEXT COUPLE YEARS. I THINK HE-

00:41:38.529 --> 00:41:40.231
RIGHTS OF THE FORMULA LOOK AT.

00:41:40.297 --> 00:41:42.566
A GENERALLY THE PROGRESS THE PA

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:44.235
ARE. WHEN THE PROPER NINETY

00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:46.003
EIGHT GUARANTEE. IS GOING FAST

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.838
THAN PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:50.841
AND WHEN THE STATE RECEIVES. A

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.309
LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL GAINS

00:41:52.376 --> 00:41:53.577
REVENUE IN EXCESS OF THE

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:55.546
HISTORICAL AVERAGE ONE OF THE

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.014
OTHER REQUIREMENTS FROM AND A

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.083
TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT.

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:00.851
JUST ONE B. OPERATIVES AND SO

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.019
YOU FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:42:02.086 --> 00:42:04.221
FINANCE MENTIONED EARLIER THAT-

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:07.892
JUST ONE IS OPERATIVE- ALL

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:11.128
THREE YEAR OF THE BUDGET PERIOD.

00:42:11.195 --> 00:42:11.729
VERY LIKELY TO BE OFF OF THE

00:42:11.795 --> 00:42:13.464
NAY COUPLE OF. AND SO EVEN

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.368
THOUGH THE STATE HAS MADE-

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.003
RESERVE DEPOSITS IN THE- THIS

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.237
IS LIKELY TO BE A DANNY THAT

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:23.274
WILL BE TO ABOUT- FOR YEARS AND

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.478
IT'S- AS WELL. I AM WHAT DOES

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:29.847
IT TAKE TO. CREATE TO RELEASE.

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:30.781
MONEY FROM THE- BACK AND THE

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:31.415
STATE BUDGET WHAT'S THAT

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:33.517
PROCESS. THAT IS GOING BY CON.

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.619
FORMULAS AND THAT'S REQUIRED.

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.187
THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:38.756
GUARANTEE ISN'T GROWING FAST

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.591
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT THE PRIOR

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:42.359
YEAR'S FUNDING LEVEL ADJUSTED

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:45.329
FOR. INFLATION FACTOR IN

00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:47.031
CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:50.301
SO IF FOR EXAMPLE TWENTY TWO

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:51.802
TWENTY THREE WAS A VERY OR YEAR

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:54.338
OR EVEN A- OR A MEDIOCRE YEAR

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:55.706
IN TERMS OF STATE REVENUE IT'S

00:42:55.773 --> 00:42:56.640
LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:58.375
WITHDRAW SOME OR POTENTIALLY

00:42:58.442 --> 00:42:59.610
ALL OF THAT THREE BILLION. IN

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.111
ALLOCATE THAT OUT TO SCHOOLS

00:43:01.178 --> 00:43:02.913
AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND A

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.148
TIME WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.816
LEGISLATURE YOU CAN DECIDE

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.052
WHICH PROGRAMS IN WHICH AREA IS

00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:09.687
AND HOW THE RESERVE DEPOSIT IS

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.555
DISTRIBUTED BACK ON BUT IT'S

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.490
BEEN. IT'S BASICALLY LIKE PARA

00:43:13.557 --> 00:43:16.226
THE RAINY DAY RESERVE ITSELF IT

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:18.629
IS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE MONEY IN

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.431
GOOD TIMES AND BE ABLE TO SPEND

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:22.199
IT IN BAD TIMES TO TRY TO EVEN

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:26.704
OUT THE- THE TROUGHS. IN THE

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.237
BUDGET THAT'S THE DESIGN.

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:29.006
THAT'S THE BASIC DESIGN OF.

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.574
THE- THE PROPOSITION AND EIGHT

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:31.675
RESERVE A LITTLE BIT RESTRICT

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.644
IN TERMS OF WHEN DEPOSITS GO IN

00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:35.012
SO WE DON'T MAKE DEPOSITS INTO

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:36.347
THAT ACCOUNT AS OFTEN AS WE DO

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.110

TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.993

ERIN GEN. HI I APOLOGIZE

00:52:38.121 --> 00:52:43.593
THERE'S A MAYBE A BIT OF A LAG.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:45.662

MANAGED MENTIONED- BUT I LOOK

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:04.047
AT IT AGAIN AS A WITHIN THE

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:05.515
BROADER SCHEME OF THE OF THE

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:07.984

PROGRAMS OUTSIDE THE LCF OUT

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.556
MEANS LESS FUNDING FOR OTHER

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.624
PROPOSALS PRIORITIES- THAT ARE

00:53:14.691 --> 00:53:16.092
ALSO OUTSIDE THE LCF

00:53:16.159 --> 00:53:17.060
POTENTIALLY SO IT'S JUST A

00:53:17.127 --> 00:53:19.930
CONVERSATION UP WITH IN. IN A

00:53:19.996 --> 00:53:21.898
FINITE OF RESEARCH WHERE WE

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.633
PRIORITIZE THINGS SO THAT WAS

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.268
THE ONES WERE WE WILL AT WHEN

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.037
WE DECIDED TO- ONLY PROVIDE THE

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:29.506
COMPOUND COLLEGE THE LCI AFTER-

00:53:29.573 --> 00:53:32.375
SO THAT WE COULD- PUT FORTH ALL

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:34.411
PROPOSED THAT YOU IN SIGNATURE

00:53:34.477 --> 00:53:35.645
AMOUNTS- AND THE OF SOMETHING

00:53:35.712 --> 00:53:36.880
LIKE THREE HUNDRED MILLION OUR

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.148
ESPECIALLY. OR INTERVENTION

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:40.016
GRANTS CONTINUATION IT'S

00:53:40.083 --> 00:53:41.084
SEVERAL THINGS LIKE THAT THAT

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.719
WOULD HAVE TO BE A SMALLER AND

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:45.055
PERHAPS LESS SIGNIFICANT IF WE

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:47.057
MADE THE CHOICE TO PROVIDE A

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.258
COMPOUNDED CALL OUT TO ALL

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:49.826
THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS SO NOT

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.094
THEY ARE WITHOUT MERIT

00:53:51.161 --> 00:53:52.529
CERTAINLY BUT JUST AGAIN PART

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:55.098
OF THE KIND OF BROADER- BUDGET.

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.132
CONSIDERATION AND WE HAVE TO

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.534
MAKE ONE WHEN PUTTING FORTH

00:53:57.601 --> 00:54:01.037
THAT MUCH KIND IF IT TURNS OUT

00:54:01.104 --> 00:54:03.573
THAT THE LEVEL OF REVENUES IS

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.075
SUSTAINED WHICH IS HIGHER THAN

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:07.077
THE ESTIMATE AND YOU MIGHT GET

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:09.279
SOME DISPLACEMENT FOR. TESTING

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:11.081
COSTS OR MEDICAL COSTS THAT ARE

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:13.183
IN YOUR PROPOSAL THAT MIGHT

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:16.786
FREE UP MONEY OF FOR THIS AS AS

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.388
IT NATURALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:20.190
SPEND A THREE DIFFERENT WAYS SO

00:54:20.256 --> 00:54:21.558
YOU KNOW WE LOVE TO DIFFERENCE

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:22.792
TO BE PAID OFF WE WOULD LOVE

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.394
FOR THE COLD TO BE OUTSIDE BUT

00:54:24.461 --> 00:54:25.862
ARM THAT WOULD GIVE YOU

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:27.564
FLEXIBILITY OF SOME OF THOSE

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:37.307
INSTANCES. CAME TO PASS RIGHT.

00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:39.843
THIS THIRD. I THINK IT'S YEAH

00:54:39.909 --> 00:54:41.478
IF PROBABLY WAS LARGE AND WE

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:42.512
HAVE MORE READ. WERE BE OF IT

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:44.114
AND OF THAT FUNDS BECAUSE I. A

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.716
INFLUX OF. EACH FIND AYE AYE

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:47.717
THINK CERTAIN THAT THE

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:50.687
COME TOO MUCH WHEN WE HAVE.

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:51.321
MORE MONEY THAN WE KNOW WHAT TO

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:53.390
DO WITH SO YEAH THINK. THAT

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:55.759
THAT'S A REASON TO- APPROACH TO

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:58.028
HAVE- I DON'T KNOW I'VE HEARD.

00:54:58.094 --> 00:55:03.133

00:55:03.199 --> 00:55:06.936
PROBLEM I SUPPOSE YEAH. MMHM

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:08.138
AND HE ONE THING AND DON'T KNOW

BEST DO THIS MAY I JUST WITH

00:55:09.406 --> 00:55:14.310
THE- A. O. THEN GO- EITHER WAY.

00:55:14.377 --> 00:55:15.311

CHAIR CABANA DALLAS AUSTIN SO.

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:53.983
PROJECT IN A COLA HAS- BEEN A

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.553
LITTLE BUT A EXERCISE IT'S-

00:55:56.619 --> 00:55:59.389
COMES TO US. FROM A FEDERAL AND

00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:00.356
THAT'S DESIGNED TO REFLECT

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:03.526
REFLECT THE COST OF. ATTENDANCE

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:04.828
PURCHASED BY STATE LOCAL

00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:05.995
GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:06.996
THAT'S THE NOW IS A GREAT

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:08.665
MEASURE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:12.001
CALIFORNIA- ARTICLE ESTIMATES

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.336
COME FROM- THE CONSENSUS

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:14.504
FORECAST THAT'S PREPARED BY

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:16.573
MOODY'S ANALYTICS. AND THEY

00:56:16.639 --> 00:56:18.408
HAVE THE COLA HOVERING AT

00:56:18.475 --> 00:56:20.276
AROUND ONE AND A HALF PERCENT.

00:56:20.343 --> 00:56:21.211
PER YEAR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

00:56:21.277 --> 00:56:23.179
YEARS SO THAT IS A BIT LOWER

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:24.647
THAN WHAT DISTRICTS ARE USED TO

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.116
THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN AROUND TWO

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:27.684
AND A HALF PERCENT OVER THE

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:32.956
PAST TWENTY YEARS. OR SO- SO

00:56:33.022 --> 00:56:34.324
THEY IS A I THINK IT CAN. FOR

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:36.092
YOU AT THAT THERE MIGHT. AN FOR

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:39.662
DE. TO MY THESE RELATIVE STILL.

00:56:39.729 --> 00:56:41.264
OR MODEST. COST OF LIVING

00:56:41.331 --> 00:56:42.799
ADJUSTMENTS THE NEXT YEARS JUST

00:56:42.866 --> 00:56:46.603
KIND OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:51.908
CUT A OF ME AS COVERED A BIT.

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:53.276
FROM WHERE IT WAS IN JUNE BUT

00:56:53.343 --> 00:56:54.811
WE'RE PROJECT BUT- AT A LOT OF.

00:56:54.878 --> 00:57:00.550
ARE SLOWER IN COUPLE OF.

00:57:00.617 --> 00:57:01.918
REFINED I THINK IT'S A LITTLE

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:04.053
BIT OF A HIGHER ASK COVERING

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:04.888
CLOSER TO PER. OVER THE COUPLE

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:09.926
YEARS- I'D IT'S A TO- INDEX TO

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.695
BRIDGE THE GAP- SO THAT BUT I

00:57:12.762 --> 00:57:13.997
THINK THAT WE AND A HALF TO.

00:57:14.063 --> 00:57:15.899
PERCENT THAT'S KIND GOOD

00:57:15.965 --> 00:57:17.367
PLANNING RANGE FOR A DISTRICTS

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:22.005

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:29.879
SOME MORE IN SOME WAYS TO. LA

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.881
SPEAK FOR TO CRACK. AND WILL

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.016
