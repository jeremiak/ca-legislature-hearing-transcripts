I RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN IS HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN WE WELCOME YOU. YEAH. OKAY. I GOOD AFTERNOON. EVERYBODY HAVE SHOWED UP. I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE IN STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE TIME AND COMMITMENT IS IMPORTANT ISSUES. THIS BILL O'DONNELL LOT AROUND AND PROTECTED WITH A PROTECTION OF EMPLOYEES. WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND BRIGHT. BUT SOMETIMES OR RULES THAT DO INVESTIGATIONS ARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYEE BASE SOME OF THESE ROLES MIGHT BE PATIENT RIGHTS ADVOCATES. ADVOCATES FOR FOSTER CHILDREN POLICE. AUDITOR'S ALL OF THESE ROLES THEY PROTECT BOTTLE POPULATIONS BUT THEY THEMSELVES DON'T HAVE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION. SO THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TO THE EXTENT WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE NON EMPLOYEES CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WORKING TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND DO INVESTIGATIONS AND PROVIDES A WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS TO THEM AS WELL AND I HAVE WITNESSES WITH ME HERE. IN SUPPORT. PLEASE CAN WE KEEP IT A TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS THINKING. THANK YOU THE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN. MY NAME IS SAMUEL JAN AND I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES. WE ARE THE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND WE ARE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT EVERY COUNTY HAVE A DESIGNATED PATIENTS RIGHTS OFFICE. TO. RECEIVING INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF ALLEGED PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND MONITOR LOCKED PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH PATIENTS RIGHTS LAWS. OUR WORK IS CRITICAL TO IMPROVING CONDITIONS IN QUALITY OF CARE WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. HOWEVER OUR PROFESSION HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH INSTANCES OF RETALIATION RESULTING IN FEAR AMONGST ADVOCATES THAT THEY MAY LOSE THEIR POSITION FOR FULLY CONDUCTING THEIR STATUTORY DUTIES. APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OR EMPLOYEES OF A CONTRACTED ORGANIZATION. UNLIKE COUNTY EMPLOYEES THESE CONTRACTED ADVOCATES DO NOT HAVE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. OUR DUTIES MAY REQUIRE US TO INFORM STATE LICENSING ABOUT SERIOUS PATIENTS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AT A COUNTY FACILITY WHICH ARE COUNTY MAY FROWN UPON. ADVOCATES HAVE HAD THEIR CONTRACT NOT RENEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF FORWARDING A PATIENT COMPLAINT TO LICENSING. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN WOULD EXTEND ALREADY EXISTING WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES TO CONTRACTORS IN A WATCHDOG ROLE. THESE WOULD APPLY TO OTHER CONTRACTED ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES FOSTER CHILDREN ARE ELDERLY AND INDEPENDENT POLICE AUDITOR PROGRAMS. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE PROFESSIONS PROTECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT THEIR JOB WITHOUT FEAR FOR IT THANK YOU. THE NEXT WITNESS. I THINK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK ON AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN. I MY NAME IS JUSTIN BUS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL. I AM THE STAFF MEMBER FOR THE PATIENT RIGHTS COMMITTEE I WHICH IS MANDATED IN WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE AND IS TASKED WITH ADVISING ON POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT AFFECT PATIENT RIGHTS IN THE PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. LAST YEAR THE PATIENT RIGHTS COMMITTEE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF COUNTY PATIENT RIGHTS ADVOCATES WITH OVER FIFTY PERCENT RESPONSE RATE. I COMPLETED MOST OF THAT ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY DATA. WE FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE FIFTH OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES OF CONTRACTED ORGANIZATIONS. REPORTED THAT CONCERN OVER LOSING THEIR CONTRACT AFFECTS HOW STRONGLY THEY ADVOCATE AGAINST PRACTICES AND POLICIES THAT THEY BELIEVE VIOLATE THEIR CLIENT'S RIGHTS. WE ARE VERY STRONGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. ONE SURVEY RESPONDENTS STATED. THERE IS NO AUTONOMY OR PROTECTION FROM ADMINISTRATORS THAT MAY SEE YOU AS AN ADVERSARY OR A THORN IN THEIR SIDE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR CAN CHOOSE TO DIVERT OR SILENCE THE EFFORTS OF AN ADVOCATE AT ANYTIME. ALL OF US ARE SUBJECT TO UNCHECK REPERCUSSIONS IF WE RUFFLE THE WRONG FEATHERS. RECENTLY THERE WERE TWO PENSION RIGHTS ADVOCATES WHOSE CONTRACTS WERE NOT RENEWED IN A NORTHERN COUNTY. THIS WAS SUB GOOD SUBSEQUENT TO A TWO MONTH THE COMMUNICATIONS BLACKOUT FROM THE LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR. AFTER AN ADVOCATE REPORTED A SERIOUS PATIENT RIGHTS COMPLAINTS. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN WILL PROVIDE. A LEVEL OF PROTECTION TO PATIENT RIGHTS ADVOCATES AND OTHER PROFESSIONS IN SIMILAR WHAT STOCK RULES. SO THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO FEAR EMPLOYMENT. SITE WILL NOT HAVE TO FEAR EMPLOYMENT RETALIATION FOR SIMPLY PERFORMING THE REQUIRED JOB DUTIES. OF THE COUNCIL SEEKS YOUR SUPPORT IN THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU.

THURMOND. AYE THURMOND AYE. FLORA. FLORA I. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. CONSULT WHICH I JONES SAWYER KALRA MCCARTY MELENDEZ LENDERS AYE. BY BILL AND STOP. GRADUALLY SOME BILLS OUT THINKING. SO A MENTALLO PRESENTING AB THIRTY EIGHTEEN. MR LOW WHATEVER IT AND THAT YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS A. B. THIRTY EIGHTEEN INCREASES COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE RULED BY IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY. I WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER WITH ME IS SPEAKING AND SUPPORT IS CAESAR DS BEHALF OF THE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL. THANK YOU AYE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HAS IDEAS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. WELL I THINK YOUR STAFF AND OF COURSE OUR AUTHOR WHO WAS CARRYING A BILL VERY IMPORTANT BILL. TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS FOR ALTERNATE DELIVERY PROJECTS. BY PUBLIC AGENCIES. AS YOU KNOW THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SEVERAL BILLS TO ARE AT THE SKILLED INJURING WORKFORCE PROVISIONS. WITH. A. B. THIRTY EIGHTEEN SIX TO DO WITHOUT BETTER COMPLIANCE WE ARE WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC AGENCIES TO IMPROVE THE PROCESS OF THAT ERA BY COMPLYING THE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RULES ARE. BUT THAT WE'RE TARGETING MORE APPRENTICES TO GO TO THESE PROGRAMSTHAT THEY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA HAS A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE READILY AVAILABLE TO ACHIEVE THE PROJECTS WE ASK FOR YOUR IBM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE'S SUPPORT. THEY WILL ALSO SUPPORT. SEEN ON ANY OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN VICE CHAIR ACTUALLY SCOTT GOVERNOR PERHAPS THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL NOW WE ARE WORKING WITH THE PROPONENTS WE AGREE THAT THE WORK FORCE SHOULD BE SKILLED AND TRAINED. WE WANT TO CERTAINLY CLEAN UP SOME OF THE ITEMS IN THE BILL THAT WE FIND PROBLEMATIC THEY'VE BEEN RECEPTIVE WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANK YOU. THEY DO ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT BY OPPOSITION I'M SORRY. YOU MISTER CHAIR CHAIRMEN PARA RICHARD MARX AND ON BEHALF THE WESTERN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTORS ASSOCIATION THE PLUMBING HEATING COOLING CONTRACTORS OF CALIFORNIA. SAN DIEGO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS. FOR IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. WE SUPPORT THE IDEA OF THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE BUT WE REALLY THINK IT IT'S BEEN A RUSE. SINCE ITS INCEPTION TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE CODE SECTIONS THAT MANDATE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS OR THAT MANDATE THE SKILLED TRADES WORKFORCE. THAT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS IF YOU HAVE A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT YOU'RE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS A THAT ARE REQUIRED OF EVERY OTHER CONTRACTOR. THAT'S THE BILL THAT CREATES THE KNEW STATUTORY PENALTY FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE SKILLED TRADES WORKFORCE REQUIREMENT. CONTRACTORS WORKING UNDER THE PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT NEVER HAVE TO MAKE THE REPORT AND THUS ARE NEVER SUBJECT TO THE PENALTIES. IF THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS TRULY WANT A BILL THAT ENCOURAGES THE USE OF SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE IT WOULD APPLY IRRESPECTIVE TO WHETHER THERE WAS AN EXISTENCE OF A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT OR NOT. WE'VE ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO ACCEPT. AN AMENDMENT THAT STATES THAT IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY OTHER PROVISION IN STATE LAW. A THAT THE PENALTIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT. APPLY IRRESPECTIVE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT UNTIL THAT LANGUAGE IS ADOPTED WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAN STONE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS FOR THE. EXEMPTION IF WE'RE GONNA PYITHU ONE WE SHOULD APPLY TO ALL THINK YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. SEEN ON BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THE QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US FOR IT'S IMPORTANT I WANT TO KNOW THAT OF COURSE WHEN THERE IS PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENT WE ARE GUARANTEED A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE SO THAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING THAT. THANK YOU FOR INSPIRED AND. LIVED THE BILL. I THINK THE BILL HAS A FIRST IN THE SECOND. IS WHY I'M SORRY MISS MOMENT. THANK YOU. SO. THE PLA'S. DON'T HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE SAME RULES FROM WHAT I'M LOOKING AT. IS THERE ANYWHERE IN STATUTE WHERE IT SAYS PLA'S ARE ALWAYS GUARANTEED TO HAVE A TRAINED AND SKILLED WORK WORK FORCE. SURE. YOU WANT. THREE QUESTION. OF. THE STATUES ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE PLA'S THAT CONTAIN THE SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS AS WELL. THE ONLY LIMITATION AS REGARDS TO APPEAL A IS THAT THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE AS IF SOMEONE ALREADY MENTIONED APPEAL A HAS ALL THE REALLY THE BILL TEN SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS. THAT IS THAT THE UNION PROGRAMS ALWAYS PUT THEIR MEMBERS THROUGH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THE LAST TYPICALLY THREE TO FIVE YEARS. NOT OF THAT THE JOURNEY OUT AND BECOME THE SKILLED AND TRAINED BY THE DEFINITION OF THE STATUTE. WHAT IS NOT HAVING TO DO HERE IS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT TO THE PUBLIC A YOU SEE THAT'S THE ONLY KIND OF THE STREAMLINED THE PROCESS? WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S A CAR ABOUT THEIR. THROUGH THE CHAIR UP BECAUSE IT'S BUILT INTO THE ACTUAL CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT ON THE WORK FORCE WOULD APPEAL A IS IS A WORKFORCE AGREEMENT. AND THE WORK FORCE AGREEMENTS ALREADY STIPULATED THAT THE SKILLED AND TRAINED BECAUSE YOU'RE ACTUALLY HIGH PEOPLE WATER HIRING HALLS. AND THERE'S ACTUALLY OPPORTUNITIES FOR NON UNION WORKERS IN THE SKILLED TRAINED WORKFORCE PROVISIONS THAT ACTUALLY DO NOT MEET. THE ACTUAL GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT. THE ESCULENTA RAIN ONLY GOES UP TO SIXTY PERCENT SOME OF THE FORTY PERCENT. ACTUALLY COULD BE A PERSON THAT'S EITHER AN APPRENTICE OR A PERSON THAT HAS A NUMBER OF YEARS TO HAVE GRADUATED IN THE INDUSTRY. STILL CONSIDERED A SKILLED TRADES PERSON BUT NOT NECESSARILY MEETING THE PERCENTAGES OF THE SKELETON WORKFORCE PROVISIONS FOR THE STATURE. I GUESS THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE MR LOW IS. THAT THERE IS ALREADY A PROVISION IN THE LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE. CESSATION CESSATION OF PAYMENT SHOULD THEY NOT COMPLY WITH THIS BARREN. THAT. TRAINED LABOR FORCE SO AND THAT'S A PRETTY BIG HIT TO NOT GET YOU PAYMENT FOR YOUR WORK SO WHY ARE WE ADDING ON SUCH AS SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL BURDEN ONTO. ONTO WHAT ALREADY EXISTS YES THE VILLAGE THEM INTENSE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE AND THAT'S THE IMPETUS OF THE BILL. AND ENSURING THAT WE ADDRESS THAT AT THE HANDS AND SO THAT IS WHAT THE LEGISLATION ATTEMPTS TO TRY TO DO AND ADDRESSING AND THE LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE AND SO THEY'VE BEEN SIGNIFICANT CONCERN FOR THE LEVEL OF COMPLIANCE. WHAT WHAT CONCERNS? SURE SO. I MEAN GOING ON WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID BASICALLY THE LEVEL COMPLIANCE AND UNDER WHAT YOUR QUESTION WAS. THAT WHEN A CONTRACTORS IN COMPLYING AND THEY WERE PAYMENT IS WITHHELD THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT THE PROCESS IS TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT CONTRACTOR HOLE. IT COULD BE A SUB CONTRACTORS NON COMPLIANT AND THEN FOR FILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SKILLED AND TRAINED. IN THAT SITUATION A FAIR PROCESS THROUGH A PENALTY WHAT ACTUALLY BET ME BETTER THAN ACTUALLY WITHHOLDING THE PAYMENTS FROM THAT GENERAL CONTRACTOR. OR THE SUBCONTRACTOR AND THEN IT'S AN EITHER OR YOU EITHER DON'T CONTINUE TO RECEIVE% PAYMENT OR YOU CAN FIND URINARY YOU'RE INNOCENT ATTEMPT TO CREATE A MORE FAIR PROCESS. BECAUSE THE WITHHOLDING OF PAYMENT. WHO KEEPS THE PAYMENT SHOULD THE GENERAL CONTRACTOR KEEP THE PAYMENT SHOULD THE PUBLIC AGENCY KEEP THE PAYMENT AND IS IT FAIR FOR NONCOMPLIANCE FOR THERE TO BE A WITHHOLDING OF THE ENTIRE PAYMENT? AND SO WITH THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO IS TO ACTUALLY GET A MORE FAIR PROCESS BY PUTTING IN A PENALTY INSTEAD OF A WITH HOLDING ENTIRELY. OF THE CONTRACTORS WORK. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WAS LOW WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE EXTRACT YES RIGHT. THANK YOU. YEAH. APPRECIATE THE BILL COMING FORWARD AND THAT. IT HAS AN AYE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR. I DO APOLOGIZE I'M ACTUALLY EMULATE OFFER THE BILL THERE'S A CUSTOM CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU AND I ACTUALLY I WANT TO HAVE ABOUT THIS AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF OUR DISTRICT THINGS THAT I WANT TO. DISCUSS WITH YOU BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO. IMPOSSIBLY SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR. BUT APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE BILL FORWARD THANK YOU. YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMOND FLORA. FLORA NOT VOTING GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE. JONES SAWYER. KALRA. MCCARTY. KALRA AYE MCCARTY MELENDEZ MULLIN DOES KNOW THAT THERE WAS ON CALL. BILLS UNCLE THANK YOU YOU. MS BAKER PRESENTING AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY TWO FROM PERMISSIBLE MISTER VOEPEL. THANK YOU. AB MEMBERS I APPRECIATED THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS AB TWO FOUR EIGHT TWO ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMAN VOEPEL WHO'S ILL TODAY I'M SORRY TO SAY WELL I KNOW WE ALL HOPE THAT HE IS WELL SOON. OF THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EMPOWER AN EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST AN ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULE PROVIDING FOR UP TO FOUR TEN HOUR WORK DAYS WITHIN THE SAME FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK. THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A STANDARD LAW. AND THIS IS BASICALLY TO PRESERVE PROVIDE THE SAME FLEXIBILITY FOR A FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS AYE WITHIN OUR FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK LAWS AND THAT AN INDIVIDUAL SHOULD HAVE. OF THAT MANY OF WHO ARE PART OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING OR EXEMPT EMPLOYEES HAVE IT IS ABSOLUTELY. WHERE WE SHOULD BE GOING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW AS YOU KNOW UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW TWO THIRDS OF EMPLOYEES WITHIN A WORK UNIT HAVE TO AGREE TO IT I LACKED A FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE OF UP TO FOUR TEN HOUR DAYS? WITHIN THE FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK AND. THIS IS WE ARE ONE OF THE LAST THREE STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOES REQUIRE THIS TYPE OF PROCESS IN ORDER FOR INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES TO DO THIS. HAVING A FLEXIBILITY WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN REACH OUT TO THEIR EMPLOYER AND ASK HIM OR HERSELF FOR A MORE FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENT IS WHAT CALIFORNIANS DESERVE IT'S WHERE OUR ECONOMY IS GOING MORE FLEXIBILITY. AND I AM PARTICULAR THINK IT HELPS KNOW THAT IT HELPS WORKING FAMILIES PARTICULARLY WOMEN WHO ARE RETURNING TO THE WORKPLACE AFTER HAVING CHILDREN THE NUMBER ONE WAY WE CAN HELP THEM. CONTINUE ON THEIR CAREER TRAJECTORY AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME COMPETITIVE PAY AND COMPETITIVE SKILLS AND PROGRESS IN THEIR CAREER IS IF THEY HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES. I AM I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND BECAUSE WHEN I HAD ARE TWINS A INSTEAD OF HAVING A RIGID SCHEDULE I REALLY WANTED TO SEE IF I CAN HAVE LONGER DAYS SO I'D HAVE MORE DAYS WITH MY FAMILY. AND THAT ALLOWED ME TO BE ABLE TO BE HOME MORE. FOR SUSTAINED PERIODS OF TIMES AS MY CHILDREN WERE YOUNGER IT MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE ON WHETHER OR NOT I CONTINUE TO DO MY WORK AND CONTINUE TO MY CAREER PATH WE SHOULD BE PRESIDING. PROVIDING THE SAME TO OTHER CALIFORNIANS IN ADDITION UP IN JUST VISITING WITH CONSTITUENTS OF THERE'S THERE'S OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO SAID TO ME IF I COULD HAVE THAT ONE DAY A WEEK LET'S SAY IT'S A FRIDAY WORK MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. OF FOUR TEN HOUR DAYS THAT FRIDAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO REACH MORE BALANCE IN MY LIFE TO ALL THE ADULT TEAM THINGS WE NEED TO DO WHY CAN'T CALIFORNIA MAKE IT EASIER FOR US. TO DO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY OUR ECONOMY NEEDS TO GO AND. I THINK WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT TO CALIFORNIANS AND FINALLY COMING FROM THE BAY AREA WHERE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC IMPACTS THE MORE WE CAN HAVE MORE FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULES AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ON THE ROADS AND IN TRANSIT. AT DIFFERENT TIMES A DAY THAT ONLY HAS AN ADVANTAGE FOR ALLOWING PEOPLE. TAD EASIER COMMUTES TO GET TO WORK AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PARTNERS WITNESS IN SUPPORT. FIVE GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS TRICIA CILIC THANK YOU FOR HEARING IT AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE. I'M AN HR PROFESSIONAL ARTISTS AND YOU HEALTH WARNA. AND I'M ALSO MEMBERS SOCIETY HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SHERM. WHO HAS OVER TWO HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND MEMBERS AND A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE GLOBE? MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M STATE DIRECTOR LIKE FOR CAL SURE WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA BODY FOR THE H. R. PROFESSIONALS OVER TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. NOT I GOT ALL THOSE STATS OUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ME AND WHY I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. I THINK. IN INCOME BEING AN HR PROFESSIONAL I'M AN EMPLOYEE FOR THE EMPLOYER AND I THINK PEOPLE FORGET THAT ABOUT HR PEOPLE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HEAR EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ONAND YOU SPOKE ABOUT BALANCED LIFE ABOUT BEING ABLE TO GO HOME TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN WHAT ABOUT THE PARENTS WE HAVE MANY EMPLOYEES THAT WOULD LIKE A FLEXIBLE WORK SCHEDULE SO WE CAN GO HOME AND TAKE. CARE OF THEIR PARENTS THAT ARE AGING OR ARE ILL. AND YOU KNOW I HAVE A GRANDDAUGHTER THAT'S IN BALLET AND HOW DO I GO IN TO THAT BALANCE A YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL BE BACK IN A COUPLE HOURS. RIGHT NOW WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THE FOUR FOUR DAY FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK PASSED. IT'S HORRENDOUS WORK IT'S A LOT OF WORK YOU HAVE TO GET A LOT OF VOTES GOT ABOUT THINGS GOING WORD LEADING TOWARDS A MORE BALANCED WORK LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED THAT LET'S GET SOME OF THESE CARS OFF THE ROAD LET'S LET HAVE PEOPLE HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH THEIR LACK TO DO SOME OF THINGS THAT AE IMPORTANT THEM WHICH IS THEIR FAMILY. AND WE'RE NOT A LINE THAT BECAUSE OF HOW LAWS WRITTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MARKER THAT SOME AFTER THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY TWO FOR MANY OF THE REASONS THAT I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER MENTIONED. AND AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVE FROM SHARM ARE. AND WHAT A COUPLE THINGS TO KNOW IS THAT WE ARE ONE OF ONLY THREE STATES ARE REQUIRED TO DAILY OVERTIME AFTER EIGHT HOURS WORKED HOWEVER THE OTHER TWO STATES ALLOW SIMPLE WEAVER AS LONG AS THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER AGREE. THAT IT'S A SIMPLE WAIVER THAT THE TWO INDIVIDUALS CONSIGN THEREFORE THEY CAN ELECT TO HAVE A FOR TEN WORK SCHEDULE RATHER THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA WHERE DOES HAVE TO BE. ELECTED BY TWO THIRDS VOTE ADDITIONALLY THERE HAS TO BE A FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE REQUIREMENT AFTERWARDS THERE HAS TO BE A MEETING SET UP BEFORE THAT AND HAS TO BE DONE BY. EACH DEPARTMENT WHICH MEANS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON CANNOT ELECT TO HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE WORKWEEK SCHEDULE UNLESS THEY'RE THE ONLY PERSON IN THAT DEPARTMENT AND THEREFORE YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT THE LOBBY ALL OF YOUR CO WORKERS. IN THAT DEPARTMENT IF YOU WANTED SAY TO HAVE WEDNESDAY'S OFF IN ORDER TO PICK YOUR CHILD UP EVERY DAY FROM A MINIMUM DAY WHICH IS OFTEN. HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS SO THIS WOULD ALLOW THAT ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND THERE'S A QUOTE THAT I'VE BEEN HURT THAT I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN HEARING A LOT FROM OPPOSITION IN OTHER. BILLS AND THAT THE WORKFORCE IS CHANGING BUT THE WORKPLACE IS NOT I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY APPLICABLE HERE WE ARE NOT ALLOWING FLEXIBILITY IS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEES CONSULATE COME TO EMPLOYERS AND ASK FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY AND THEY'RE HAVING TO TELL THEM NO BECAUSE AS SOON AS THEY EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THE PROCESS IS THE EMPLOYEE DOESN'T WANNA GO THROUGH WITH IT. THERE'S ONLY TWO POINT THREE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS RIGHT NOW UTILIZING AN ALTERNATIVE WORKWEEK SCHEDULE AND THAT REALLY DOESN'T CHANGE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND AGAIN WE ENCOURAGE AN AIBO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. WE ARE JUST LIKE. THEY GOT A MINUTE. BE REALLY QUICK IF I COULD JUST DIRECT YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO THE TEXT OF THE BILL IN SECTION FOUR. SUBDIVISION A SAYS THE EMPLOYEE MUST REQUEST THE SCHEDULE IN WRITING. THERE MUST BE A STATEMENT THAT SHOWS THAT THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORK IN THE RATE OF PAY. A REQUIREMENT THAT TO BE VOLUNTARY. THAT THE EMPLOYER IS PROHIBITED FROM INDUCING A REQUEST OR THREATENING AN EMPLOYEE. AND THAT EITHER PARTY CAN DISCONTINUE THE SCHEDULE AT ANY TIME AND OF COURSE THERE'S A CARVE OUT FOR BOTH CBA'S AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES SO THERE ARE NUMEROUS BUILT IN PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYEE. IN THIS PARTICULAR VERSION OF THE BILL AND I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THE OPPOSITION WHETHER OR NOT THE EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES THAT ARE USUALLY CITED ARE OCCURRING IN THE OTHER FORTY SEVEN STATES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. AARON ROBERT ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY BUSINESS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. SEAN LUIS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO WOULD LOVE TO PROVIDE THIS FLEXIBILITY OPTION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE. OPPOSITION PLEASE. MR CHEN MEMBERS AYE KITTEN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION HERE IN OPPOSITION. THIS IS A BILL THAT. HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP EVERY YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN HERE WHICH IS THIRTEEN YEARS NOW. AND A BILL THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE THING THAT ALLOWS PARENTS TO COME HOME TO THEIR KIDS AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THE EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. THAT IS WHAT ENSURES THAT THE EMPLOYER HAS A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO LET YOU LEAVE. WHEN WE ASK THAT WORKERS. AND BE PUT IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN. WAVE THESE CORE RIGHTS THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT MAKE THAT A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. ONE IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS ARE OUT WELL CAN BE TERMINATED FOR ANY REASON. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS BILL HAS LANGUAGE IT SAYS THE EMPLOYER CANNOT AND. PRESSURE YOU TO DO THIS OR OR I RETALIATES AGAINST YOU IF YOU DON'T DO IT BUT IN THE NORMAL WORKPLACE. THOSE KINDS OF MESSAGES ARE SENT TO WORKERS ALL THE TIME IF YOU'RE A TEAM PLAYER MOST OF US HERE WE WAIVE THE RIGHT TO DAILY OVERTIME ITS. FLEXIBILITY THIS IS A GREAT THING MOST WORKERS DO WHAT THEIR EMPLOYERS ASK THEM TO DO SUGGEST THAT THEY SHOULD DO WHAT OTHER WORKERS SAY HELPS YOU GET AHEAD. ON OUT THE JOBBER HOPES TO KEEP THE JOB. SO WE THINK THAT ALLOW IT CREATING A SCENARIO WHERE WORKERS CAN WAVE HE'S VERY QUEER RIGHTS IS DANGEROUS NOT ONLY BECAUSE WORKERS HAVE SO FEW PROTECTIONS. BUT BECAUSE ON THE FLIP SIDE THERE IS THE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUGE FINANCIAL SAVINGS FOR THE EMPLOYER SO WHEN YOU HAVE THAT IMBALANCE YOU HAVE HUGE. ARE INCENTIVES FOR THE EMPLOYER TO TRY TO CUT. UM'S THE COSTS BY GETTING WORKERS TO WAVE DAILY OVERTIME AND YOU HAVE WORKERS WHO FEAR LOSING THEIR JOBS SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS AROUND THE KIND OF VOLUNTARINESS WE DON'T THINK. MOST THINGS CAN BE DONE VOLUNTARILY IN THAT SETTING. BEYOND THAT HERE'S THE OTHER PIECE THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL NOTHING IN THIS BILL AND NOTHING IN ANY OF THE BILLS THAT HAS EVER BEEN INTRODUCED. HAS EVER GIVEN WORKERS THE CHOICE TO GET FLEXIBILITY YOU CAN ASK BUT IT'S THE EMPLOYER'S DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY GRANT THAT. SO OFTENTIMES THESE BILLS ARE TALKED ABOUT AS GIVING SOME KIND OF FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY GIVE IT IS THE EMPLOYER'S CHOICE. RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE ARE NUMEROUS WAYS TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY. THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE WORKWEEK COLLECTION MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYERS HAVE. FOLLOWED THE RULES AND ADOPTED THESE ALTERNATE WORK WEEK ELECTIONS WE HAVE WORKED WITH EMPLOYERS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO MAKE THAT PROCESS EASIER. ACTUALLY THE THE ALTERNATIVE WORKWEEK ELECTION NOW AT THIS POINT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRESSURE OTHER WORKERS TO ALLOW YOU TO GET WEDNESDAY'S OFF THE EMPLOYER CAN ALLOW A MENU OF OPTIONS. IN THE ELECTION THEY CAN SAY WORKERS CAN OPT FOR FIVE FIVE EIGHTHS THEY CAN OPT FOR FOR TENS BIG OFFER THAT MENU AND THEY CAN CHOOSE. HOW MANY WORKERS ARE ON EACH SCHEDULE SO EVERY PIECE OF IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE EMPLOYER AND THEY CAN INJECT FLEXIBILITY? INTO EVERY PIECE. CURRENTLAW ALSO ALLOWS MAKE UP TIME IF MY KID GETS OFF EARLY ON WEDNESDAY. IKE RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW LEAVE EARLY ON WEDNESDAY WORKING ADDITIONAL OUR THURSDAY AND DO NOT ACCRUE OVERTIME. FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE'S OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT HERE ON BEHALF OF THE TEAMSTERS LONGSHOREMEN EIGHTEEN YEAR UNITE HERE I OF P. T. E. LOCAL TWENTY ONE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION THEY GET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. MORNING CARB ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC WORKERS COALITION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION VERY CURIOUS YA ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. SEEN NONE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS. BUT WHEN US. I'M JUST WONDERING MISS BAKER IF YOUR WITNESS WOULD SUIT YOUR MAJOR PROFESSIONAL IN YOUR HERE SUPPORTING THIS BILL IF OU COULD PERHAPS I COMMENT ON SOME OF THE CLAIMS OF THE OPPOSITION MADE. SURE SO. EASY ELECTION HAVE ANY OF US EVER VOTE ONE OF THOSE ARE SEEN ONE OF THOSE THAT'S IT'S JUST NOT EASY. AND WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH THE WORKPLACE YOU'RE TRYING TO BALANCE WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND AGAIN. I'M AN EMPLOYEE AS WELL SO I'M LOOKING OUT FOR ALL OF US INCLUDING MYSELF. TRYING TO DO AN ELECTION IN GETTING THINGS DONE WITH SO MUCH AS I NEED TO DO THIS ON FRIDAY IS NOT THAT EASY OR I NEED TO DO THIS FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS BECAUSE. MY MOM HAS EARLY SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT I'M SORRY WE NEED TO DO ELECTION WE NEED TO WAIT THIRTY DAYS IN FORTY DAYS AFTER THAT WE WILL THE AND THEN? AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WELL MY MOM TALKING TO MAKE THAT LAW SO IT'S NOT THAT EASY IT'S ABOUT GIVING THE FLEXIBILITY AT THE TIME THAT IS NEEDED FOR THE EMPLOYEE. INCLUDING MYSELF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN. I I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OBVIOUSLY I I FEEL LIKE. EMPLOYERS HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN A OF FOR THOSE. I'M SURE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BENEVOLENT. EMPLOYERS THEY CAN CURRENTLY OF BE FLEXIBLE WITH HOURLY WORKERS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE IN HOURLY JOBS NOT SALARIED. AND THEY CAN GIVE THEM OVER TIME. FOR WORKING TEN HOURS IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WORK AND THEY CAN GIVE THEM TIME OFF TO GO TO THEIR FAMILY THE TRUTH IS THAT'S NOT EASY TO SECURE FROM AN EMPLOYER PERIOD. THE EMPLOYER COULD BE NEUTRAL ON THE VERY HARD AS YOU SAID HAVE YOU EVER SEEN IT ED EASY ELECTION WE SHOULD TRY UNIONIZATION ELECTION BUT YOU KNOW AS AN EMPLOYER HAS BEEN EVELYN WHO WANTS TO WORK WITH. THEIR THEIR EMPLOYEES WHO CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES COULD BE NEUTRAL IN A UNIONIZING. ELECTION IT IF THEY SO CHOSE IN FACT THEY COULD DO CARD TECHNICALITY I'M SO THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS I THINK IF YOU HAVE. THE EASE EMPLOYERS IN THESE MANAGERS WHO WANT TO DO BEST BY THEIR EMPLOYEES AND LET'S NOT FORGET WHO ARE TALKING ABOUT WE TALK ABOUT HOURLY WORKERS THE MOM WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN WHO. WAS AN ATTORNEY AT A LAW FIRM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOURLY WORKERS WHO I NEED PROTECTIONS WHO I AM ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE WHEN ANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN WITH OUR BOSSES. AND SO I APPLAUD ALL OF THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE WORKED WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES TO INSURE WHETHER IT'S BY THE ELECTION WHETHER IT'S BY ALLOWING FOR UNIONIZATION WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OR WHETHER IT'S BY ACTUALLY PROVIDING OVER TIME WHEN YOU GO BEYOND THE DAYS. AT EIGHT HOURS TO DO THAT I'M PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE FEW STATES IT'S STILL HONOR THE EIGHT HOUR DAY AND I'M SORRY MEN HAVE TO BE VOTING NO TODAY. COLOR THINKING. THANK YOU WAS SURE. AND YOU KNOW I. THAT EIGHT HOUR. FORTY HOUR A WEEK. THE WORK WEEK AND EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY. IS ON THE WAS FOUGHT FOR. VIGOROUSLY PEOPLE DIED. BECAUSE THE WORK CONDITIONS THERE ARE PUT UNDER. AND SO YOU KNOW THE THE LABOR MOVEMENT THAT BOB FOR THE WEEKEND TO A IT WAS A STRUGGLE THAT I THINK THAT OFTENTIMES. WE TAKE FOR GRANTED BECAUSE WE AND HOW TO DO THE STRUGGLE TO GET THERE IT'S BEEN A MATTER OF FACT. THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S A MATTER OF FACT IT IS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GO HOME TO THEIR CHILDREN. AFTER WORKING FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT TOOK KEPT LONGER THAN THEY GET PAID FOR THAT. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS AN IMBALANCE AND THE POWER BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND THAT WILL EMPLOYEE. AND A TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE IS JUST NOT BEEN AS IT'S JUST NOT REALITY. AND FOR ANY SITUATION SOMEWHAT HAS MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WE'LL HAVE YOU OUT IS ABSOLUTELY SUMMER SICKLY BICU GIVE HOW MUCH VACATION HOURS INDICATION DAYS YOU GIVE A YEAR. SO MANY OF THOSE EMPLOY EMPLOYERS DON'T GET HARDLY ANY IF AT ALL. I AND YOU CAN SAY IT'S VOLUNTARY BUT THEN OF THE DAY IF YOU ARE THREE EMPLOYEES ARE GOING TO GO TO THE FORTY HOUR. FOUR DAY WORK WEEK AND YOU'RE THE ONE THAT DOESN'T. AND YOU'RE OUT WELL HOW MUCH LONGER YOU GONNA BE THERE. I'M NOT VERY LONG AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THOSE THAT WORK. AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT NOW ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS IN THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME. AS ALTHOUGH OF LOW WAGE WORKERS OUR THAT ARE REQUIRED THE EITHER TEKELI OPTIONAL BUT THEY WORK TO THE HOLIDAYS AND THEY WORK ON BLACK FRIDAY THEY WORK ON THE THANKSGIVING DAY MAY BE COMPENSATED FOR IT. BUT THE END OF THE DAY THAT SPEAKS TO THE IMBALANCE IN THE POWER. THAT THE WORKER HAS WITH THE EMPLOYER AND I REALLY HOPE THAT EMPLOYERS AT THEIR TRULY SINCERE. AND CARE ABOUT FLEXIBILITY FOR THEIR WORKERS WOULD CONSIDER GETTING MORE SICK DAYS MORE VACATION DAYS AND THAT IF THEY DID HAVE A LOVED ONE THAT WAS SICK. AND HAD THE LEAD TO TEND TO THEM THAT THEY WOULDN'T TERMINATE THEM BECAUSE OF THEIR ABSENCES AT WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING IT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THEIR FAMILY IN THE COMMUNITY. JUST FOR A QUICK COMMENT AND THIS IS NOT ELIMINATE THE EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY AND OVERTIME REQUIREMENTS IT SIMPLY PROVIDES AN EXCEPTION ON AN INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS FOR AN EMPLOYEE THAT WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. FLEXIBILITY AND IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ON AN OVERALL BASIS THE EIGHT HOUR WORKDAY THINK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTION WAS COMMITTEE. SPEAKER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE YES PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THEY HAVE THE COMMENTARY AND THAT THAT COMMENTS IN THIS. I'D DO UNDERSCORE DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE A EIGHT HOUR WORK DAY OR FACT SICK LEAVE OR ANY OF THE OTHER STATUTES THAT ARE IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE. WHICH ARE MANY TO PROTECT THAT WILL EMPLOYEES FROM WRONGFUL TERMINATION FROM WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION WE HAVE VERY. EMPLOYEE FAVORABLE LAWS IN THAT REGARD. WE'VE HEARD AT SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE VERY MUCH AT A LEVEL OF WHAT I DON'T THINK IS AT ISSUE IN THIS BILL I'M REALLY AM THINKING OF THAT. THAT MOM IT'S GOING BACK TO WORK. AFTER HAVING KIDS WHO NOW IS GOING BACK TO EMPLOYMENT SITUATION WHERE SHE ALREADY FEELS A LITTLE BIT LIKE SHE'S GOING TO BE BURDENING HER COLLEAGUES. BECAUSE SHE'S GOING TO NEED MORE TIME OFTEN NEEDS THIS WORKPLACE SO NOW SHE'S GOT TO GO TO THEM. AND SHE HAS TO LOBBY THEM. AND I DON'T DIDN'T JUST EXPERIENCES AS AN ATTORNEY WHO DID NOT GO BACK AS AN EXEMPT EMPLOYEE AFTER I HAD KIDS. I KNOW MY GOOD COLLEAGUE ISN'T IN THE ROOM TO HEAR THAT BUT THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN WHICH I WENT BACK TO WORK AND HAVE THIS FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE. IT WAS DURING THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. TIME WHEN THE LAWYERS ARE BEING SHED FROM LAW FIRMS AND I'D BE LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO GET A JOB AT A LAW FIRM. BUT I'M THINKING OF THAT MOM HE'S GOING BACK TO THE EMPLOYEE THE VERY THE VERY EMPLOYEES I REPRESENTED AS AN ATTORNEY FOR EMPLOYERS WHO WANTED TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. SHE'S GONNA BE GOING ALSO HER COLLEAGUES TO TRY TO CONVINCE THEM AYE I NEED THIS. SO THAT I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SAME THING BUT CAN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER FOR THIS AND GO THROUGH THE SCHEDULE AGAIN AND AGAIN. AND A WHOLE ELECTION PROCESS WHICH TO QUOTE THE OPPOSITION SAID AT EVERY PIECE OF IT IS CONTROLLED BY THE EMPLOYER. THIS BILL PUTS THE POWER WITHIN THE HANDS OF THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME IN CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT MOM ALREADY IS GOING TO FEEL LIKE SHE'S GOT THE BURDEN ON HER AND SHE'S SHE IS. IMPOSING UPON HER COLLEAGUES AND ONCE AGAIN NOW SHE'S GOING TO ASK THEM TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND THERE'S MORE THAN JUST A THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF BENEVOLENT EMPLOYEES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BENEVOLENT EMPLOYEES EX EMPLOYERS EXCUSE ME WHO'D WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A MUCH MORE AGILE RESPONSE. TO THAT EMPLOYEE WHO IS ASKING FOR THIS FLEXIBILITY AND. I THINK IT IS FOR GETTING THE THAT THAT WHAT I'M FIGHTING FOR FOR THOSE INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEES IS THE SAME BENEFITS THAT MANY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND EXEMPT EMPLOYEES HAVE IT'S THE VERY HOURLY EMPLOYEES. WHO NEEDS THIS FLEXIBILITY AND THE AGILITY OF HER EMPLOYER TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS WITHOUT HAVING TO ALREADY GOING TO A WORKPLACE AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE WITH COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PERSONALIZED SCHEDULE? AND THAT IS THE WAY OF A MODERN WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S WHAT ARE CALIFORNIANS DESERVE AND FOR EVERYONE WHO TALKS ABOUT PAY EQUITY FOR WOMEN WHICH I HAVE SUPPORTED HISTORIC LEGISLATION FOR PAY EQUITY. WHEN THE NUMBER ONE THINGS YOU CAN DO IS MAKE SURE EVERY SINGLE WOMAN WHETHER THEY'RE PART OF A UNION OR NOT. WHETHER THEY'RE EXEMPT OR NOT OR AN HOURLY EMPLOYEE HAS THE ABILITY TO GO BACK TO WORK MORE EASILY TAKE CARE OF HER FAMILY AND CONTINUE ON HER CAREER CALIFORNIA MAKES THAT HARDER THIS BILL MAKES IT EASIER EASIER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THE US BAKER. HOW PLEASE CALL THE ROLL? I'M SORRY THIS I DO HAVE TO MAKE. THE HAS A POST ON THE CHAIR AND I WOULD HAVE WE SUPPORTIG IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THURMAN. FLORA FLORA AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. JONES SAWYER. KALRA KNOW KALRA UNKNOWN MCCARTY MELENDEZ. MELINDA'S I. THE BILL'S UNCLE THINK YOU THINK YOU. AND ON BEHALF OF MR OF OF VOEPEL THINK AS WELL. MISS CARILLO PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT. READY WHEN YOU ARE IT DOESN'T MEAN AND ONE WITNESS TO COME IN. WE GOT ALL DAY. PACKED OUTSIDE. IT'S SO. SCREW WHENEVER YOU'RE READY ALRIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PERSON PRESENTING IN THIS COMMITTEE. DIFFERENT TYPE OF ROOM IT'S THE BEST COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT. A BILL THAT WOULD STRAIN OUR EFFORTS AND AND DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT ALL STATE CONSTRUCTION TRADE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS. THE CONTROL THE CONSTRUCTION FIELD OFFERS GOOD PAY RETIREMENT PLAN HEALTHCARE BENEFITS HOWEVER IT'S THE FIELD AND BENEFITS THAT MOSTLY DOMINATED BY MEN. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA WOMEN. MAKE UP ONLY ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT A BUILDING TRADES APPRENTICE. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ARE THE DE AYE ARE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX APPRENTICESHIPS. BUT ONLY ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE OF THEM WERE LED BY WOMEN. THIS BILL WILL FACILITATE OPPORTUNITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN MORE WOMEN OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS OFFER THEM A WELL PAYING JOB. THIS BILL BROADENS THE AUTHORITY OF THE DIR TO OVERSEEING NONDISCRIMINATION EFFORTS AND ENSURE GREATER PROTECTION FOR WOMEN AGAINST HARASSMENT. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY A WILL ALLOW APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO INTERVENE TO STOP HARASSMENT OR EVEN DISCONTINUE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYERS WHO DO NOT COMPLY WITH THESE NEW POLICIES. AS A RESULT THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE MORE WOMEN TO PURSUE CAREERS IN CONSTRUCTION BY HELPING THEM FEEL SAFE AND PROTECTED. WHILE DOING THEIR JOB. IN SOLIDARITY WITH SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT TODAY IS DONE ON DAY. IT'S A DAY THAT ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGES RAPE. AND SEXUAL ASSAULTS AGAINST WOMEN. WELL WEARING JEANS. MOST OF US ARE. AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT FOSTERS GREATER REPRESENTATION BY WOMEN OF WOMEN BY FACILITATING INCREASED GENDER DIVERSITY AMONG THE CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALISM AND JOB SITES. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IZZY'S IDEA IF THE LEGISLATIVE POLITICAL DIRECTOR. WHO'S IN THE BACK. AND DEBORAH CHAPLAIN DIRECTOR OF SPECIAL PROGRAMS OF STATE OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AND SELENA DERAIL OF CARPENTERS LOCAL ONE FIVE TWO WITH HER OWN PERSONAL TESTIMONY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE KEEP AWARENESS IS A TWO MINUTES A PIECE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OF MY NAME IS DEBORAH CHAPLAIN AND WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL. AND FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH WOMEN IN THE TRADES AROUND THE STATE ORGANIZING OUR OF ANNUAL NATIONAL CUP OUR ANNUAL STATEWIDE AND THEY BECAME NATIONAL CONFERENCES. WE KNOW THAT EVEN AFTER YEARS OF REALLY HARD WORK BY TRADE SUMMIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS TO RECRUIT MORE WOMEN THE NUMBER IS STILL VERY LOW AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN SAID ONLY A TWO TO THREE PERCENT ARE WOMEN. WORKING WITH THE TOOLS. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION AND CONSTRUCTION ARE UNFORTUNATELY STILL REAL. PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT WILL GO FAR LETTING WOMEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO BE TRADED TREATED FAIRLY. AND WITH DIGNITY ON THE CONSTRUCTION WORK SIDE THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN WOMEN IN THE TRADES SO THAT WE CAN FINALLY BRING UP THAT PERCENTAGE. AND REACH A CRITICAL MASS. THIS BILL DOES TWO REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS THE FIRST IS THAT PRECIOUS APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS MUST PROVIDE TRAINING TO ALL OF THEIR PARTICIPANTS IN INSTRUCTORS ON PREVENTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION. THIS TRAINING IS ALREADY BEEN CALLED FOR IN A. TWENTY NINE CFR THIRTY OF THE FEDERAL APPRENTICESHIP GUIDELINES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR THIS BILL MANDATES AT THIS TRAINING INC IT BECOMES PART OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL. GIVEN THE WHIMS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TODAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS TRAINING WILL BE PART OF THE CURRICULUM IN CASE THE FEDS BACK OFF. SECONDLY AB TWENTY THIRTY EIGHT. TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT ADDS AN IMPORTANT FUNCTION IF AN APPRENTICE INFORMS HER PROGRAM ABOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION ON THE JOB SITE. THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS EMPOWERED TO ACT IN HER DEFENSE AND MAY REFUSE TO SEND APPRENTICES TO THAT PARTICULAR JOB SITE UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS DEALT WITH. WE'VE DONE SURVEYS WE KNOW THAT WOMEN VIEW THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AS A SAFE PLACE WHERE WOMEN CAN BE COMFORTABLE AND RESPECTED. NOT SO MUCH OUT AT THE WORK SITE. WITH THIS BILL WOMAN WILL KNOW THAT THE REACH OF THEIR APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM IS EXTENDED TO KEEP THEM SAFE OUT ON THE JOB SITE AS WELL. SO. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR SPONSORING THIS BILL AND WE URGE YOU TO PASS AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT. AND WE'RE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS BILL WITH TRADES WOMAN INK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH X.

WHILE SHE HAD. WHILE SHE HAD COMPLAINED TO HER EMPLOYER ABOUT HIM. HER APPRENTICESHIP DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. HAD AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY THREE FIFTY EIGHT BEEN IN PLACE.

SURE MEMBERS TODAY ON DENIM DAY THE LEGISLATURE COMES TOGETHER TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT INTO STAND WITH SURVIVORS WE WEAR JEANS AND SOLIDARITY SHOW THAT WHAT YOU AWARENESS NOT INVITATION FOR HARASSMENT THAT SAX SEXUAL ASSAULT. AT ITS CORE IS AN ABUSE OF POWER. JANITORIAL WORKERS ARE AMONGST THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKERS IN OUR SOCIETY THIS INCREASINGLY FEMALE WORKFORCE OFTEN WORKS ALONE AND AT NIGHT. THIS ISOLATION FROM CO WORKERS IN THE PUBLIC REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING SOMEONE INTERVENE OR SERVE AS A WITNESS TO THE RAMP IT. OCCURRENCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SALT AND THAT HAPPEN IN THE WORKPLACE. IN MANY CASES THESE WORKERS ARE IMMIGRANT WOMEN OF COLOR WHO DOT ALWAYS SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY FURTHER IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MISTREATMENT. THESE CONDITIONS ON TOP OF LOW WAGES LEAVE THEM EXPOSED TO EXTREME ABUSES ON THE JOB. WORKERS OFTEN DO NOT KNOW WHERE TO REPORT ABUSES WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN AND MANY SUPERVISORS NOT TRAINED PROPERLY ON HOW TO RESPOND LEAVING THESE WORKERS WITH NOWHERE TO TURN. AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE WORKS TO CHANGE A CULTURE OF HARASSMENT FEAR IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY WHICH IS FAR TOO LONG HAS TURNED APPLY A BLIND EYE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT. THIS LEGISLATION EMPOWERS JANITORIAL SERVICE WORKERS BY UTILIZING EXISTING PEER COUNSELORS ARE PERMIT TAUGHT US. TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT TRAINING TO FELLOW JANITORIAL WORKERS ON HOW TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. AND IT'S ON THE WORKPLACE. PEER TO PEER COUNSELING THAT HAS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE TEACHING TOOL ALLOWING WORKERS TO MORE CLOSELY RELATE. WITH THEIR PEER COUNSELOR AS OPPOSED TO AN OUTSIDE SOURCE OR AGENCY WHILE ALSO CHIPPING AWAY AT THE ISOLATION THAT HIS ALLOW THESE PERPETUAL ABUSES IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS IS. A FOLLOW UP TO OUR FIRST WHAT I CONSIDER FIRST ME TO BUILD. THAT THAT CAME THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE WHEN OUR JANITORS CAME FORTH AND SAID THEY NEEDED PROTECTION FROM BEING RAPED ON THE NIGHT SHIFT BASICALLY. I'M WE PASSED THAT BILL IN IN THAT BILL WE HAVE. THE REQUIREMENT THAT THESE WORKERS ARE GIVEN. INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES THE NEXT STEP IN SAYS WE KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE IN A BETTER SPOT IF THEY ARE TAUGHT. FROM FROM SURVIVORS FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRAINED TO TO COMMUNICATE. WITH THESE WORKERS AND NOT JUST SIMPLY FROM AN ATTORNEY OR SOME SLIDE SHOW THAT ALL OF US. SEEM TO. WATCH BUT HAVE. A LESSER EFFECT MAYBE ON ON A THE OUTCOMES SO. I HAVE SOME WITNESS HERE STE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING THIS TIME TO TESTIFY. MY NAME IS SANDRA HENRIQUEZ SOME EMBASSY ó WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE. I SEE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE WORK OF THE JANITORIAL PROMOTE THOUGHT US. AND THE RAPE CRISIS MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO TAKE THEIR HEALING. AND WELL BEING INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND THEY SAID ENOUGH. THEY MOBILIZED ORGANIZED AND TRAINED THEMSELVES. FORTY SIX YEARS LATER THE RAPE CRISIS SAFETY AND IT IS A PROFESSIONAL EYES MOVEMENT. WHICH HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL. STRENGTHENING SYSTEMS INSTITUTIONS AND HELPING SURVIVORS TO HEAL. RIGHT CRISIS ADVOCATES HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF PEER TRAINING AND APPEAR RESPONSE. THEY'VE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STANDARDS AND THE DELIVERY OF TRAINING FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REPRESENTATIVES. AND A VARIETY OF INSTITUTIONS. THIS PEER TRAINING MODEL HAS BEEN TRIED AND TESTED FOR OVER FORTY YEARS AND HAS SERVED AS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE STATE'S RAPE AND SEXUAL ABUSE SAFETY NET. RIGHT CRISIS STATUS STRATEGIES ARE STEEPED IN THE PEER TRAINING PHILOSOPHY AND MODEL WHICH. SHARES MANY OF THE KEY TENANTS OUTLINED IN AB TWENTY SEVENTY NINE. PEER TRAINING RECOGNIZES THAT THOSE AFFECTED BY SEXUAL VIOLENCE ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND AS SUCH ARE THE BEST SUITED TO DEVELOP VICTIM CENTERED STRATEGIES. PIERRE TRAINING FACILITATES THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BECAUSE TRAINERS ARE OFFICE ARE OFTEN SEEN AS BEING APPROACHABLE. AND ARE RECOGNIZED FOR HAVING WALKED IN THE OF THEIR OWN SHOES. THE THE OTHER PERSON'S SHOES. PEER EDUCATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER TYPES OF ADULT LET EDUCATION. IN TERMS OF CHANGING BEHAVIORS ATTITUDES AND NORMS. IN MY THIRTY PLUS YEARS WORKING IN THIS FIELD I HAVE LEARNED THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS ARE PASSIONATE AND TENACIOUS. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THEIR COMMITMENT THAT WE ARE IN THIS MOMENT OF ELEVATED VISIBILITY SURROUND THE ISSUES SURROUNDING THE ISSUE OF RAPE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE WITNESSED THIS GROUP OF WOMEN FROM THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY. SINGLE HANDEDLY DEMAND CHANGE IN THEIR INDUSTRY. THEY ARE NOT ONLY CAPABLE THEY ARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS TO TRANSFORM THE CULTURE WITHIN THAT INDUSTRY. THEY ARE THE PIER TRAINERS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE TRAINING ADDRESSES REAL ISSUES. AS THEY PLAY OUT IN THE WORKPLACE. THEY ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT CLIMATE AND THEREFORE MOST INVESTED INCLUDING A CREATING A WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THOSE. WHO SEXUALLY HARASS OR HARM WOMEN ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE? IN WHICH JANITORIAL WORKERS KNOW THEIR RIGHTS AND KNOW HOW TO ACCESS REMEDIES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY. PIERRE TRAINERS ARE BEST SUITED TO HELP CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WOMEN FEEL SAFE. GOING TO WORK ON THE NIGHT SHIFT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. I WHEN ASSEMBLY NUMBER IS BUT I THINK I WANNA. LEVINE A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS VERONICA AWARENESS SO DANNY DOT E.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON MARKETS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL AT THE FIRST THE COUPLE THINGS THAT I WANT TO COVER ARE THE. CONCERNS WITH THE AFFILIATE REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THE DEPTH OF NATURE OF THE HARASSMENT TRAINING REQUIREMENTS UNDER CURRENT LAW EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED I'M A JANITORIAL SERVICE INDUSTRY EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE THE NAME OF ANY SUBCONTRACTOR OR FRANCHISE SERVICING CONTRACT AFFILIATED WITH THE BRANCH LOCATION THE TOTAL NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES OF THAT AFFILIATE OUT OF EACH LISTED BRANCH OFFICE AN ADDRESS OF EACH WORK LOCATION THAT BRANCH OFFICE HOWEVER AFFILIATE ISN'T DEFINED WHAT. EXACTLY DOES AFFILIATE MEAN POLICY AND EMPLOYER IS SUPPOSED TO KNOW HOW MANY EMPLOYEES IN PHILLY HOUSE WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE'S TURNOVER AT THE AFFILIATE HOW OFTEN THEY HAVE TO UPDATE THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. IS THOSE KIND OF CONCERNS THAT WOULD EXPOSE EMPLOYERS TO ADDITIONAL. CAN YOU JUST FLOWED OUT DOWNLOAD OUR EVENNESS SORRY. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AT THE SECOND PART IS THE DUPLICATIVE NATURE OF THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING AT THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT DOES PROVIDE TRAINING WE UNDERSTAND THAT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO CAN DO PROPOSED TRAINING HOWEVER UNDER FEE HA A TRAINER IS ALLOWED TO BE AN ATTORNEY A PROFESSOR OR INSTRUCTOR OF HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL OR HUMAN PREVENTION CONSULT HER BASSINET PREVENTION CONSULTANT. UNDER THIS BILL. A PEER TRAINER WOULD NEED TO BE HIRED IN ADDITION TO THOSE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING TRAINERS AND THE BILL STATES THAT THE PEER TRAINERS M. MUST BE PAID A. WAGE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR THAT WOULD BE A STATUTORILY REQUIRED WAGE OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR AND ADDITIONALLY THEY WILL BE PROVIDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT TRAINING THAT'S DONE BY. ANOTHER TRAINER AND SO THE. DUPLICATIVE NATURE OF THIS REQUIREMENT IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY WITH IT THAT IT'S STATUTORILY REQUIRED THANK YOU SO MUCH SORRY ABOUT THE SPEED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE OPPOSITION. TRICKER CAN I JUST HAD A CHRISTMAS HAILING CAN I HAVE JUST ONE ADDITIONAL POINT WE'VE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN. REGARDING DFT H. VERSES THE LABOR CODE. HEAD LIKE A LAST WEEK IN THE LABOR COMMITTEE AND. OR IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE PERHAPS IT WAS I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHICH ONE IT WAS. ANYMORE. BUT A NARROWER VERSION OF THIS WAS A I'M SORRY. A NARROW BILL AB FIVE SIXTY NINE AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ FLETCHER WAS VETOED LAST YEAR BY THE GOVERNOR. AND WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID IS I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND SO WE SHOULD. WE THINK THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING AT ALL SHOULD REMAIN WITH INDIA FEE H. RATHER THAN MOVE OVER TO THE LABOR CODE THANK YOU. AND SHAUN THOSE THE NATIONAL FEDERATION INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. CENA AND BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. ITS COLOR. THINK MISS SHARE. I FIRST OF ALL I WAS WAS COUPLE YEARS AGO I KNOW WHEN. ASSEMBLY GOOD GONZALEZ FLETCHER AND OTHERS WE LED THE CHARGE HERE. AND I WAS UP IN SOUNDS IN THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE REALITY IS THAT. THE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE NEED TO HAVE MEANT WHAT WE'RE REALLY THESE JANITORS THESE WOMEN VERY BRAVE WOMAN THAT STOOD UP AND SPOKE OUT. AYE EVEN WHEN PEOPLE WEREN'T LISTENING. I'M GLAD THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE TO SEE NOW BUT. BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT. IT WAS EXTRAORDINARILY COURAGEOUS AT THE TIME. UP WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TALKING ABOUT THE STUFF. TO PUT. AT YOUR JOB ON THE LINE AND MANY DID. EDITOR BICU BONTA HERBAL AND COURAGEOUS AND TALKING ABOUT PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. I AND I YOU KNOW NOT ONLY. I HAD I HAD THE PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO HOST OF THESE ON ONE OCCASION SCREENINGS OF RAPE ON THE NIGHT SHIFT AND. THOSE VERY POWERFUL VERY MOVING AND CLEARLY LEAD TO REAL ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND NOW GONNA POST THE INITIATION OF THE NEED TO MOVEMENT. I THINK IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT WE CONTINUE TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES. THOSE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF ASSAULT I KNOW ITS. UNLIKELY A COINCIDENCE THAT THIS BILL IS HERE BEFORE US TODAY ON DENIM DAY. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE SYMBOLIC ASPECT OF THAT IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO THAT SUBSTANTIVE. AYE AYES SINCERELY DO NOT BELIEVE. THAT. IT'S. OVERLY BURDENSOME TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL PEER COUNSELOR TO THE TRAINING THAT'S NOT DUPLICATIVE AT ALL I THINK THAT IF THERE'S A SENSE. FROM ANYONE ELSE THAT IS DUPLICATIVE I DON'T THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT APPEARED COUNCIL REFORMATORY AT. PREMATURE DOES. AND A SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS THAT IS OBSOLETE NESTLE SPECIAL MORE TALKING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW ON EMPLOYER DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY EMPLOYEES IT HAS. OR THAT WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER CONTRAST HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN CONTRACTING OUT SERVICES FOR JANITORIAL SERVICES THAT THEY CAN ADD ONE SIMPLE LINE A BY THE WAY CAN YOU PROVIDE US INFORMATION HOW MAY EMPLOYEES HAVE AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED. YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE SUGGEST THAT SOME OF THESE ARE HAPLESS EMPLOYERS THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT THEIR WORK FORCES JUST THE IT TOTALLY FALLS FLAT. I THINK THIS IS A KIND OF. THIS IS THE KIND OF ISSUE WHERE IT WOULD REALLY. AYE I THINK BEHOOVE EMPLOYERS TO GET ON BOARD AND SAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EASILY DO TO SUPPORT. THE WORKERS THAT ARE SUFFERING THAT ARE SUFFERING TODAY HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND IT'S FRANKLY DISAPPOINTING. THAT. ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS. THOUGH THE FACT THEY HAVE TO PAY TWENTY FIVE BUCKS AN HOUR HOPE FOR ACCOUNTS ARE TO COME IN WITH THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE DATA. IS IS CONSIDERED AN OBSTACLE RATHER THAN. DAMN BEING PROACTIVE IN PROTECTING THE VICTIMS THAT WORK. IN THERE COMPANIES THAT WORK ON SITE. THAT CLEAN THEIR FACILITIES ARE I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DISCRIMINATORY ISSUES HERE SOMETIME JUST LABOR BUSINESS WITHOUT YOU. THIS IS THE DECENCY ISSUED THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE WHERE WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR ALL VICTIMS PRICKLY THOSE COURAGEOUS WOMEN. THAT HAVE STEPPED UP. ATTACK TO TELL THEIR STORIES WHICH IS WHICH ARE SO POWERFUL. AND SO. IT'S MY HONOR DOES THAT MAKE. OF A MOTION. MOTIVATED TO MOVE THE BILL AND ASSET I CAN BE JOIN IN ANY CAPACITY POSSIBLE WAS A CO AUTHOR. I IN SUPPORT AND OF COURSE I WAS OUT THERE TODAY A THE. I THINK IT IS IN OUR TIME IS UP IT'S IT TIMES UP ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE OUGHT TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN IN OUR GOAL TO PROTECT. OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING SERVICE ON OUR BEHALF. QUESTION OR COMMENT ON THE BILL. REMEMBER MELENDEZ THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. SO  <u><c.green>I DID WATCH</c></u> RIGHT ON THE NIGHT SHIFT THE SENATE TO ME I WAS A YEAR AGO I THINK MAYBE MORE HERE'S ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO YEAH. AND I WAS SHOCKED BY WHAT I SAW I'M SO I SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MY PROBLEM IS YOUR STATUTORILY MANDATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PAY FOR A JOB AND I. REALLY WISH THAT WASN'T IN THIS BILL. BECAUSE I I JUST THINK WHETHER IT'S A VOLUNTEER OR WHETHER THEY GET PAID TWENTY FIVE OR HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR WON'T. WON'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING THE TRAINING AND I'M KIND OF THE GUIDANCE ALONG THE WAY. SO I. UNFORTUNATELY FOR THAT REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT I WISH I COULD BUY. BUT I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR BRINGING IN FORT INDIAN ORCHARD DOWN. THEY WHAT ELSE WISHING TO COMMENT OR ASK A QUESTION. I'VE SEEN NINE I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I DO IN ON THAT I KNOW IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT AND A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT I DO AND THE REASONING FOR THAT IS. THESE AREN'T. WOMEN UNFORTUNATELY WHO CAN VOLUNTEER THESE ARE WOMEN WHO ARE ACTUAL JANITORS WHO HAVE BEEN. MOST THE TIME THEMSELVES ALREADY HAVE HAVE EXPERIENCE A SITUATION. WHO HAVE FACED SEXUAL ASSAULT HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE I'M TO THE OPPOSITION YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY KEEP BRINGING UP A DIFFERENT BILL ABOUT WHY NOT PUT THINGS IN THE LABOR CODE AND I'D SAY THERE'S A LOT OF CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR? AS NUMBER ONE THIS IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BILL THAT WAS ALREADY PLACED A IT COMPANIONS OF ALL THOSE PLACE IN LABOR CODE. BUT SECONDLY. IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN EVERY OTHER STATE THIS NATION HAS BEEN DOING IN REGARDS TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SALT DID NOT WORK. IN WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE HAVE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WORK THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH SO WHAT WE'RE PRESENTING BILLS THAT DON'T DO IN FACT AT THINGS INTO THE LABOR CODE WHICH GIVES A PATH TO THE WORKER TO GO TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. WHICH MAY BE MORE COMFORTABLE SPOT THAN ACTUALLY FILING A LAWSUIT THROUGH FEE HAD. I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT SEEMS UM. LIKE HEY WE ARE THE DISC WE WE ARE READY ALL AGREED WHERE WHERE THIS BELONGS WILL WE HAVE WE HAVE AN AGREED. UP IF WE HAVEN'T LEARNED THAT THE LAST FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST YEAR I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'VE LEARNED WE HAVE GOT TO START LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THESE BILL THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THESE WOMEN. BECAUSE AFTER THEY EMPOWER THEMSELVES AND CAME AND TOLD WHAT I STILL TO FIND THE MOST DEVASTATING STORY I'VE EVER HEARD IN THIS BUILDING ABOUT NOT BEING HARASSED NOT BEING. SUBJECTED TO SOME LEWD COMMENTS OR SOMETHING BUT ACTUALLY BEING RATE AT NIGHT BY THEIR SUPERVISOR IN BEING THREATENED WITH DEPORTATION BEING THREATENED WITH LOSING.

NANCY MCFADDEN WAS THERE LISTENING TO THEIR STORIES AND WHO TOLD HIM THE BILL HAD BEEN SIGNED THAT THEY WENT OUT AND. GOT A GROUP TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH THE IDEA OF OF OF HOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHANGE SHOULD BE DONE. NOT JUST ACCEPTING WHAT WE'VE ALL BEEN DOING WHICH ISN'T WORKING IT'S CLEARLY NOT WORKING AND SO FOR THEM TO GO OUT AND SEE OTHER MODELS AND TO SEE WHAT WORKS IT THAT'S CULTURALLY COMPETENT THAT MAKES SENSE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE WORKERS AND NOT JUST ATTORNEY WHO IS PRESENTING.

WE'LL HEAR FROM THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE BILL WILL HEAR FROM THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE BILL BUT MORE IMPORTANT BUT WE'RE ASKING EVERYONE TO DO IS SALANDER CREATIVITY. ON IDEAS TO SUPPORT IMMIGRANT WORKERS. AND THE INDUSTRY'S THE GROWERS THAT THAT EMPLOY THEM. WITH THAT. PLEASEGIVE YOUR ATTENTION A TO SOME MEMBERS AYE GARCIA INCOMING DATA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING YOU FOR FACILITATING NAM. AND COMMITTING TO CONTINUE A DISCUSSION ON A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. KNOWING NATIONALLY BUT I THINK. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS IT RELATES TO NOT JUST THE ECONOMY. SECURITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT FOOD SECURITIES AND YOU KNOW HALL RANGE OF ISSUES THAT. ARE CONNECTED TO THIS THIS PROBLEM. A DATA OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS. IS THAT THERE ARE LESS IMMIGRANTS ENTERING THE U. S. AND SPECIFICALLY CALIFORNIA ANNUALLY AND DURING THE KEY TIMES IN AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. THIS REDUCTION AND IMMIGRANTS ENTERING THE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA HAS RESULTED IN A SMALLER WORKFORCE AVAILABLE TO WORK IN THE STATE AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS REDUCTION IN THE READY AND WILLING WORKFORCE IN THE AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES HAS RESULTED IN LABOR SHORTAGES FOR THESE TWO KEY INDUSTRIES IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. OR THE SAME TIME PERIOD WE HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN THE WAGES PAID TO FARMWORKERS FOR CERTAIN CROPS AND REGIONS IN THE STATE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AG EMPLOYERS IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS AND AN EMERGENCE OF HEALTH AND OTHER BENEFITS THAT COME ALONG WITH IT. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS WE HAVE NOT SEEN ONE STUDY NATIONWIDE NOR DATA FROM ANY STATE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL AG AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES AND HAS FOUND THAT U. S. BORN WORKERS. ARE MOVING TO STATES WITH WORKER SHORTAGES IN THESE TWO INDUSTRIES. THE U. S. BORN WORKERS SIMPLY IS NOT ATTRACTED TO WORKING IN THE AG OR SERVICE INDUSTRIES DESPITE THE INCREASE IN WAGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN. REPORTED IN NEWSPAPERS THROUGHOUT THE NATION. I HAVE HEARD FROM GROWERS IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY THROUGHOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND SALINAS VALLEY THAT THE LACK OF LABOR HAS CAUSED THEM TO LEAVE CROPS ON THE VINES. ON TREES AND IN THE FIELD ENSUING IN SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS A BIPARTISAN BILL DESIGNED TO ADDRESS TO LABOR SHORTAGES IN THE AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. IT WOULD CREATE A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD COME UP WITH THE BEST WAYS TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE. A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WORKER PROGRAM AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPROVAL WOULD SUBMIT THE REPORT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'D LIKE TO TAKE SOME TIME TO ADDRESS THE MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE BILL. FIRST OFF THE BILL WILL NOT CREATE A GUEST WORKER PROGRAM IT WOULD CREATE A RESIDENT WORKER PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LIVING. AND WORKING HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR YEARS. FURTHERMORE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE US CONSTITUTION MAKE STATES DEPENDENT ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR IMMIGRATION POLICY. BECAUSE OF THAT WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THE MEMBERS OF CALIFORNIA DELEGATION WHO AGREED THAT THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION. THE REAL BIG CONVERSATION HAPPENING IN CONGRESS. IS HAVING TO DEAL WITH BAKA AND THE WALL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS TO GET THE ISSUE OF THE LABOR SHORTAGES ON THEIR RADAR BECAUSE OF THE SEVERE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES THEY HAVE HAD AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WORSENING. THAT BEING SAID IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CALIFORNIA HAS THE KEY AND TRIMMING ROLE IN HOW THIS PROGRAM WILL BE OPERATED. WHILE THE PROVISIONS WOULD NEED TO BE NEGOTIATED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. OUR BILL WILL BE GOING TO DHS ONLY AFTER WE HAVE CRAFTED IT. IN THE WAY THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE THE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR STATE. IF WE DO NOT LIKE WHAT DHS COMES BACK WITH. THE GOVERNOR HAS THE COMPLETE AUTHORITY TO REJECT THE VERSION DHS PROPOSES. LASTLY THIS BILL DOES NOT UNDERMINE ANY EFFORTS CONGRESS HAS MADE REGARDING IMMIGRATION POLICY FOR FARMWORKERS. THERE IS A PROVISION IN OUR BILL THAT SAYS ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WOULD PREEMPT A STATE. PROGRAM. WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S STANCE ON IMMIGRATION POLICY WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. ARE TOO VITAL TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY TO DO NOTHING. THE EDTA ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND FARM WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE NATIONAL AGRICULTURE SURVEY ESTIMATES THAT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF FARMWORKERS ARE ON AUTHORIZED. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNAUTHORIZED WORKERS ARE DEPORTED. BY SETTING THE GROUNDWORK FOR A STATE RUN RESIDENT WORKER PROGRAM. THAT IS WHY THAT THE AKAKA'S IT DOESN'T THIS BILL IS THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITY. THOUSANDS OF MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR STATE ECONOMIC STANDING WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE ACTIVE INVITED CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. DESPITE THE WELL INTENTIONED AND SUSTAINED EFFORTS BY MANY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND FROM CALIFORNIA. ARE IMMIGRANT WORKFORCE HAS GONE THROUGH SOME VERY DIFFICULT TIMES. WE HAD MORE DEPORTATIONS IN THE PREVIOUS NINE YEARS THAT WE HAVE HAD AT ANY OTHER TIME SINCE THEY'D HAVE BEEN KEPT ON THIS PROCESS. DESPITE THE INTENTIONS OF THE CLEARING CITIES COUNTIES AND STATE SANCTUARIES FOR IMMIGRANTS MANY FAMILIES CONTINUE TO BE SEPARATED. THROUGH APPREHENSIONS AND DEPORTATIONS BY FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES. AND DESPITE THE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE PERMANENT STATUS AND OR CITIZENSHIP. THROUGH LEGISLATION TO BLOCK THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE WE ARE. VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN THE COURTS DECIDE THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT GO BY THE WAYSIDE. HOWEVER THERE THERE'S NOTHING THAT IS ON THE TABLE IN CONGRESS OR BEFORE THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT WOULD EXTEND PROTECTIONS AND JUST TREATMENT. FOR UNAUTHORIZED IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED MIGHTILY TO THE ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS HE SERIOUS FARE AND PRACTICAL PATH. PORT THAT IS DESIGNED NOT TO EXCLUDE THE POPULATION OF PARENTS AND WORKING ADULTS RELATED AND NOT RELATED TO DOCTOR RECIPIENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD. IN AGRICULTURE AND SERVICE INDUSTRIES FOR STATE. THANK YOU SOME A MEMBER GARCIA SIMILAR COMING OUT OF. THINK THEY'RE VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. FIRST LET ME THANK THE CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JUST BE HERE TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT ARE INCLUDES BOTH THE SALINAS IN THE PARK HER VALLEY. AS WELL AS SOMEBODY TO COUNTY AND IT'S THE THIRD LARGEST NUMBER OF FARM WORKERS IN THE STATE AN ESTIMATED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND. WHICH IS AN UNDERCOUNT THE CROPS RIGOR WE GROW OUR SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND LABOR INTENSIVE AND WE ARE ALSO ALWAYS IN NEED OF LABOR IN THERE. THAT THIS SITUATION REALLY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE IMMIGRATION POLICIES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE MONTEREY COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS CROP REPORT FOUND THAT AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS GENERATED FOUR POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC IMPACT IT'S FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. THE TOP TEN MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CROPS IN MY REGION ARE LABOR INTENSIVE THEY WERE REQUIRE WORKERS THAT ARE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND HIGHLY SKILLED. THE LABOR SHORTAGE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS GOTTEN STEADILY WORSE AND HIS NAME IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY THIRTY PLUS YEARS IN A ROW CALIFORNIA FARMERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO LEAVE PRODUCE IN THE FIELD. THIS MEANS THAT THEY'VE GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF PLANTING. AT AT BENNING. GROWING PUTTING EVERYTHING ALL OF THE. THE NECESSARY RESOURCES INTO IT AND THEN LEAVE IT IN THE FALL BECAUSE OF A LABOR SHORTAGE. THIS PUTS FARMERS AT RISK ECONOMICALLY WASTING FOOD AND RURAL. ECONOMIES AT RISK AS WELL IN AND QUITE FRANKLY ON IT IT IS. DIFFICULT BECAUSE WITHOUT WORKERS IN THAT IN THE ECONOMY OUR LOCAL ECONOMY STARTS TO SUFFER AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE TERRIFIED THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRATION RATES AND DEPORTATIONS. I RECENTLY WENT TO A TOWN HALL MEETING ON IMMIGRATION AND WAS APPROACHED BY LITTLE GIRL. WHO TELL ME IN TEARS AS SHE WAS ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OLD THAT SHE WAS TERRIFIED TO GO TO SCHOOL? AND. SHE WAS AFRAID THAT IF YOU WENT TO SCHOOL. SHE WOULD COME HOME AND FIND HER PARENTS. GONE I'VE BEEN TOLD BY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS THAT. WHEN THERE IS A LOCAL RATE IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOMEONE IS DEPORTED THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT SHOW FOR SCHOOL DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT PARENTS DON'T SHOW UP FOR WORK BECAUSE FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THERE'S FEAR. THAT THE ICE AGENTS ARE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND PEOPLE WON'T GO OUT AND DO THEIR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES THIS IS HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON OUR SCHOOLS AND IT'S HAVING A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON OUR WORK WORKFORCE AS WELL. IT'S CREATED IN OUT UNHEALTHY ATMOSPHERE OF ENGLISH FEAR AND SUSPICION THAT HURTS FAMILIES EMOTIONALLY AND ECONOMICALLY AND FRANKLY THERE'S THIS SENSE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT NO ONE'S DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THAT'S REALLY THE REASON. WHY? WHEN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH MY. MY GOOD FRIEND FROM THE COACHELLA VALLEY ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF A STANDING UP FOR OUR FAMILIES THIS BE THIS BILL BECAME. NOT SO IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE I NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK AND TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOT JUST FOR THE DOCTOR STUDENTS BUT ALSO FOR THE WORKERS AND HAVE BEEN WORKING. ON A LOCALLY AND IN MY REGION OUT MOST OF THE WORK FORCE HAS BEEN WORKING. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS IN THERE IN THE IN THE PROFESSION AND THE AVERAGE AGE IS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY FIVE AND SO. ON MANY OF THEM ARE ON HAVE FAMILIES AND HAVE MANY DEPENDENTS THAT REQUIRE THAT REALLY. LOOK TO THEM OFFER. ON EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AND FOR. ECONOMIC SUPPORT AND MANY OF THEM ARE FREE TO GO TO WORK. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS A VERY PRACTICAL REASONABLE AND JUST APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THE SERIOUS LABORS. SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IN MORE MORE IMPORTANTLY. TO DEAL WITH THE. REALLY THAT THEY THEY HUMANITARIAN AND THE. THE SOCIAL ISSUE WHICH IS DO WE STAND BEHIND OUR IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT TO CONTRIBUTING TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. THE FARM WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO WORK HAVE BEEN DOING SO AS I SAID ON AVERAGE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS IT IS TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ACTION. THAT THING FOR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY DID YOU JUST BE HERE TODAY AND PERCENT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SOME IN THE RECOVERY YOU HAVE SOME WITNESSES. THE FIRST WITNESS A. MY NAME'S ON ARNOLD AUTHORITIES AND I. AM A CONSULTANT TO CLINIC HAS INVITED SALINAS WHO. IS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN MONTEREY COUNTY WHO IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLIGHT. OF THE PATIENTS THAT THEY SEE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THE DEPORTATIONS ON THE SEPARATIONS ARE HAVING IN FACT IN JANUARY A MAJOR STUDY BY UCSF IN BERKELEY. WAS PUBLISHED. OF OVER FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY WOMEN FARMWORKERS OF THAT WAR AT. CLINIC HAS INVTED SALINAS THAT CONFIRMED THAT THEIR FEAR DEPORTATION. WAS CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT. AT RISK OF FOUR HEART ATTACKS AND SO THIS WAS CHRONICLED IN THIS RESEARCH IS ACTUALLY PUBLISHED IN IN ONE OF THE. MEDICAL JOURNALS. SO. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT I UNDERSTOOD. SERVER SEVERAL MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE HAVE. VISAS FOR THESE WORKERS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING IN CALIFORNIA WHO AVERAGE OVER TWELVE YEARS OF HAVING LIVED IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVING WORKED IN THE FIELDS. THERE ARE NO VISAS FOR THIS POPULATION. IT IS NOT JUST A FEDERAL PROBLEM. AND THAT WAS A CONCERN THAT I BELIEVE MISS MELENDEZ. RAISED AT SOME TIME. THIS IS A PROBLEM OF THE ECONOMY. THERE ARE MAJOR ANALYSIS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OF THE LABOR SHORTAGES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND TO DO AWAY WITH WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING AND CONTRIBUTING SIGNIFICANTLY. TO THE NECK ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF THIS STATE. AYE IS AN ABSOLUTE SHAME. THIS BILL DOES NOT. SUPERSEDE FEDERAL LAW. WE DID THIS BILL AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WENT BACK TO WASHINGTON I MET ALONG WITH MISTER MIND RIGHT BETTIS WAS THE MEMBER FROM COACHELLA AT THE TIME. WE MET WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PLANNING AND EVALUATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY THEY LIKE THIS BILL THEY THOUGHT THIS BILL MADE SENSE. AND OF THE BILL HAD PASSED IN THAT EYELASH. SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE THEY WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED. THE PACKAGE THAT WE WOULD HAVE DELIVER TO. THIS BILL IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. THIS BILL CALLS FOR DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BEING DONE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OR CONSIDERED. I HAVE A STUDY HERE FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. FROM THE. SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. WHEN JUST TRYING TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED. AND IN THIS STUDY THEY SIMPLY INDICATE THAT THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE LABOR SHORTAGES THAT. OUR EXISTING AND IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR ALL OF AGRICULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACCORDING TO MR SONNY PERDUE. THE ONLY ISSUE THEY DESCRIBE THAT WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IS THE AGE TO A PROGRAM. ON BEHALF OF GROWERS THAT I CAN'T SPEAK ON BEHALF OF BUT KNOWING THEM AND HEARING THEM AND HAVING MET WITH HIM ON THIS ISSUE. NONE OF THEM REALLY LIKE THE AGE TO A PROGRAM. IN FACT VERY FEW PEOPLE LIKE THE H. TWO A PROGRAM FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS AND ALL OF THE MAJOR AG GROUPS HAVE INDICATED VERY CLEARLY THAT THEY OPPOSE THE GOODS THAT BILL WHICH WAS IS D. H. TO SEE PROGRAM. WHICH IS SIMPLY AN EXPEDITED VERSION OF H. TO A WHICH IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. SO LET'S LOOK AT THE OTHER CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED THAT WE WOULD BE NEGOTIATING WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THE GROUPS INCLUDING THE UFW AND OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING. IN CONGRESS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING NOT WOULD SIMPLY THE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE. THEY'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ARE CARRIED FORWARD THIS PRESIDENT'S. IMMIGRATION AGENDA. SO IN ESSENCE THEY ARE NEGOTIATING WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL S. MISTER. GARCIA HAS VERY WELL POINTED OUT IS WE WILL DEVELOP THE PLAN THAT WE BELIEVE MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR THE GROWERS DE INDUSTRY. AND THE WORKERS. IF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY COMES BACK WITH THE VERSION. THAT WE BELIEVE IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE THREE PRIMARY CONCERNS. THEN THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE HAS. COMPLETE AUTHORITY UNDER THIS LAW TO SAY NO. THAT IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT FEDERAL LAW. THAT IS NOT THE OPPORTUNITY YOU HAVE TO TO MAKE A DEAL ANDHAKA AND THE WALL. THE DEAL IS THAT BOUGHT THAT BILL PASSES AND WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT LAW OR THERE IS THE LAW. THIS BILL GIVES US A CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE. IT'S ABLE TO PUT A THE ISSUE OF LABOR SHORTAGES IN THE CONTEXT IT SHOULD BE VIEWED WHICH IS. AND ECONOMIC PROBLEM. AND ECONOMIC PROBLEM THAT YOU S. WORKERS WILL NOT RESOLVE IN THE YEARS TO COME. SO WE HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE WOULD REALLY LOOK AT THE MERITS OF WHAT OF WHAT WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO. WE THINK THE BILL IS A SOLID BILL IT'S VERY PRACTICAL IT HAS SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS AND FROM DEMOCRATS AND IT HAS SUPPORT FROM GROWERS AND THE WORKER COMMUNITY. WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL REALLY GIVE THOROUGH CONSIDERATION TO APPROVING THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK YOU DO YOU HAVE OTHER WITNESSES ONE POSSIBLY. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON PLEASE PROCEED MY TURN TO TALK IT IS YOUR TURN TO TALK. CRAFTS GREAT TO BE HERE. AND MY PLEA FOR THE MIKE. ALRIGHT. MY NAME IS JOE DEL BOTH GAY AND I'M A FARMER I. FARMING FIREBALL CALIFORNIA WHICH IS ON THE WEST SIDE OF FRESNO COUNTY AND I FARM LITTLE BEEN AND MERCED COUNTY ALSO. WE GO MOSTLY. ORGANIC MELANSON ORGANIC ASPARAGUS BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME ALMONDS AND A AND A FEW CHERRIES. OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN IN. MELONS FOR A LONG LONG TIME. GOING BACK PROBABLY MORE THAN EIGHTY YEARS WHEN MY ANCESTORS WERE MELON PICKERS. AND I ALSO GREW UP ON THE FARM. IN BALANCEAND I GOT TO DO ALL THAT STUFF TOO I PICK MELONS I. DROVE TRACTOR IN. AND EARN A LITTLE MONEY TO PUT MYSELF THROUGH COLLEGE. SO IT IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A LONG CAREER AND. AND FARMING. BUT IT'S A FAMILY FARM THAT INCLUDES MY WIFE MY WIFE WAS ALSO. MIGRANT FARM WORKER SHE WAS AN IMMIGRANT FROM MEXICO. AND SHE WORKS ON THE FARM SHE'S ACTUALLY THE THE PEOPLE PERSON ON THE FARM AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE HER BECAUSE SHE UNDERSTANDS THE FOLKS. AND I LISTEN. TO THEM ALSO. SO WE ALSO HAVE DAUGHTERS WORK ON THE FARM THREE DAUGHTERS AND A SON IN LAW. SO IT'S VERY MUCH OF A FAMILY FARM BUT. BUT WE WE OPERATE. GOOD BUSINESS ALSO BECAUSE WE'RE REACHING OUT A LOT OF CUSTOMERS. OUR CUSTOMER BASE IS ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES WE SELL TO PEOPLE LIKE WHOLE FOODS AND. AND WE SELL TO THE EAST COAST AND THE NORTHWEST THAN CANADA SO OUR PRODUCTS PUBLIC SCHOOL ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF WHAT WE DO. WE HAVE. WE'VE HAD MERIT MANY FOLKS CHO ACTUALLY COME OUT TO OUR FOREIGN TO VISIT US. YOU MAY KNOW A FEW OF THEM LIKE GOVERNOR BROWN HAS BEEN THERE. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN TO OUR FORM. AND AND MANY OTHERS SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND BOXER. BECAUSE I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR AGRICULTURE AND I AM ALWAYS OF I'M ALWAYS OPEN TO HAVE PEOPLE COME OUT AND LEARN. ABOUT AGRICULTURE IN OUR PEOPLE RIGHT ON THE FORM BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY LEARN WHAT GOES ON OUT THERE. AND I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF YOU TO COME OUT THERE TO THE FARM AT ANY TIME. SO WHAT I'M HERE ABOUT TODAY IS IS ABOUT OUR PEOPLE AND NOW AND THEN ARE HARSH. CHALLENGES WITH LABOR. NOW WE HAVE HAD. SHORTAGES OF LABOR. OFTEN ON FOR THE LAST. TEN YEARS AND IF IT GETS A LITTLE PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. I WOULD SAY PROBABLY THE LAST TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE A LABOR SHORTAGE WAS PROBABLY. FOUR FOUR OR SO YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE AT THE HEIGHT OF THE DROUGHT AND WE COULDN'T PLAY AT ALL OF OUR CROPS. THAT YEAR WE HAD PROBABLY A THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY PERCENT OF OUR FORM FELLOW. SO WE DIDN'T HAVE JOBS. THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD HAVE. AND AND THAT THAT HURTS US BECAUSE WE ARE SOME OF OUR PEOPLE DIDN'T DIDN'T HAVE WORK THAT HERE. BUT TODAY WE HAVE WATER AND WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS PLANTED AND WE WE CAN HOPE TO HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO PICK THOSE CROPS. MELONS ARE VERY PERISHABLE AND YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE THE VERY DAY THAT THEY'RE. THAT THEY'RE RIPE IF YOU'RE NOT THERE THE NEXT DAY THEY'RE OVERRIPE AND AND WE HAVE TO THROW THEM AWAY. AND AND IT'S A IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING JOB WE WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. WE STARTED SIGN UP AND WE WORK UNTIL WE FINISH THE FIELD. DOESN'T TAKE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES. NOW IF WE'RE SHORT OF PEOPLE IT TAKES US LONGER TO COVER THE FIELD AND SOMETIMES WE DON'T MAKE IT TO THE END OF THE FIELD AND WE LOSE SOME OF THE CROP THAT'S. AT THE OTHER END. BUT IT'S BUT IS VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE EVERY YEAR WERE WE SEEM TO BE A LITTLE SHORT OF PEOPLE AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR WORKERS TO BECAUSE. OUR CREWS ARE ARE MILLING CREWS ARE TWENTY PEOPLE BEACH HAVE A DEFINED JOB AND WHEN THERE'S. SOMETIMES A COUPLE OF PEOPLE SHORT. SOMEBODY ELSE HAS TO FILL IN FOR THEM AND IT IT IT IT DOES CREATE MORE WORK FOR. ARE UP FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE DO HAVE. SO WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO HAVE. A LITTLE BIT MORE SECURE LABOR. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER COMPANIES IN IN OUR CENTRAL VALLEY AND GET CALIFORNIA. THAT GROW. PERISHABLE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS THAT ALSO HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. AND ONE THING ABOUT CALIFORNIA THAT ó I'M ALWAYS PROUD TO TELL PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME HERE. IS THAT WE HAVE THIS THIS WONDERFUL MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE THAT WE CAN GROW ALL THESE FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT EVERYBODY WANTS. YOU GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND THEY BY OUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. AND SO THE COUNTRY DEPENDS ON WHAT WE DO HERE AND AND AND WHAT WE WHAT WE GROW HERE DEPENDS ON HAND LEVER. WE ARE NOT ANYTIME SOON GOING TO MECHANIZE MELON PICKING OR TABLE GRAPE PICKING. OR. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE OTHER CROPS THAT HAVE TO BE PICKED CHERRIES LIKE LIKE WE GROW. CAN DO A BY MACHINE WE HAVE TO DO IT BY HAND. AND HAVE SO WHERE IT WOULD WE NEED TO HAVE A DEPENDABLE OF LABOR SO. SUPPLY SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE THINGS DONE. IF WE DON'T OF IT ISN'T JUST THE FARMS GOING TO HURT IT'S ALSO THE COUNTRY THAT'S GONNA HURT BECAUSE WE WON'T BE ABLE TO PICK. THOSE HEALTHY FRUITS THAT EVERYBODY DEPENDS ON THAT BEYOND CALIFORNIA FOR. AND SO I WOULD KNOW WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS BILL. VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE I I THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP US. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO. TRYING TO DO THE BEST WE AN TO TO CONTINUE TO GROW CROPS. AND OUR OUR OUR OUR PEOPLE ARE HARD WORKING PEOPLE AND WE TAKE CARE OF THEM MY WIFE MAKE SURE THAT. AND. AND AND SO THERE ARE THEY'RE GETTING OLDER HARP OUR WORKFORCE IS AGING. WE SEE THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING IN. ARE FARMWORKERS CHILDREN. ARE NOT COMING BACK TO THE FARM. THEY'RE GOING OFF TO COLLEGE AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT WE SUPPORT THEM ON THAT. WE DO AND. SO THERE IS A A A GAP THAT'S BEING LEFT BEHIND BY OUR FARMWORKERS WHEN SOME OF THEM RETIRE FROM FROM THEIR JOBS. AND THERE ISN'T A LOT. OF A GOOD SUPPLY OF NEW WORKERS TO COME IN AND TAKE THEIR PLACE. THANK YOU SIR WE AND AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET WE'RE NOT VOTING ON THE BILL TODAY BUT WE ARE. GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT WORK THAT WILL DO GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU LAID OUT OF THE BILL LABOR SHORTAGE. AND HOW TO PROVIDE SECURITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE DOING THE WORK SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE UNDER THE THREATS. OF DEPORTATION OR OTHER MISTREATMENT OF ANY KIND SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY WHAT WE WILL BE VOTING TODAY THAT KNOW THAT WE ARE. COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THE ISSUES GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU I DO WANT TO HEAR FROM SOME OF THOSE WHO'VE COME UP FROM I KNOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUBBY OWES DISTRICT AND OTHERS WHO CAME IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY BUT I KNOW. THAT ONE OF THE BILL'S AUTHORS IS IN THE ROOM WHEN I GIVE HIM AN OPPORTUNITY IF HE WISHES TO MAKE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD QUITE A BIT OF TESTIMONY TODAY. AS FAR AS WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE WORKERS. WITH THE SHORTAGE. WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN THIS BILL QUITE FRANKLY IS SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE EVERYDAY EXPRESSING NOT HERE IN SACRAMENTO? WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN MEASURE. THAT IS VERY COMMON SENSE THAT GIVES PROTECTION. TO OUR IMMIGRANT WORK FORCE BY SAYING LET'S KEEP THESE PEOPLE. AT HOME WAS GIVEN WITH THEIR FAMILIES. LET'S REMOVE THE FEAR THAT'S BEEN STIRRED UP ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. AND GIVE THEM SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE LET'S GET THEM VETTED. LET'S GET THEM DOCUMENTED FOR GOD SAKE. AND LET THEM KEEP WORKING. LET'S DEVELOP A GROUP WAVE EDT TO LOOK AT WHAT BEST PRACTICES AUTHOR THAT WAY WE DON'T HAVE TO SIT HERE. AND HAVE A CONVERSATION OF WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD. QUITE FRANKLY MISTER CHAIR WE KNOW WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING FORWARD THIS IS A GROUP THAT GETS SET UP. WHERE THE GOVERNOR GETS TO PUT PEOPLE ON THE GROUP WHERE THE LEGISLATURE IS TO PUT PEOPLE ON THE GROUP WE WORK WITH? THE PROFESSIONALS. AN EDTA INFUSION ACT WHO KNOW THESE ISSUES THE PAST. SEOUL LOOK AT OTHER THINGS AS THEY COME UP. AND YOU KNOW A A BIG PART OF THIS AND I KNOW FOR FOR MY FOLKS ON THE RIGHT THIS GETS THESE FOLKS VETTED THROUGH HOMELAND SECURITY. THIS WORKS IN CONCERT WITH CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS THAT THE STATE HAS WITH IMMIGRATION. SO THIS INSURES THAT WERE NOT KEEPING CRIMINALS HERE THIS ENSURES THAT THESE ARE THE HARD WORKING PEOPLE. THAT WHETHER SOME OF US LIKE IT OR NOT THIS WORKFORCE. IS WHAT DRIVES OUR ECONOMY. IN MANY SECTORS NOT JUST AGRICULTURE. BUT SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN YOU BREAK IT DOWN. AND. YOU KNOW FOR ME IT'S. A I I'VE HAD TO WORK WITH MY AG COMMITTEE I GOT BEAT UP ON THE RIGHT FOR. BEING ON THIS BILL AND I SAT THEM DOWN AND I TALK TO THEM AND I SAID LOOK YOU GUYS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. THESE PEOPLE ARE HERE. THEY'RE WORKING THEY'RE TRYING TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM THE SAME OUR ANCESTORS DID. WE NEED TO GET THEM VETTED WE NEED TO GET THEM DOCUMENTED. AND WE NEED TO GIVE THEM A FAIR SHAKE AT THIS. AND IF YOU ASK ANYBODY OUT THERE AND YOU SAY HEY WHAT DID YOU THINK. AND I'LL USE THE WORD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS SHOULD BE VETTED THROUGH HOMELAND SECURITY EVERYBODY WILL TELL YOU YES. EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A FEW MORE ON THE LEFT SO THIS BILL WHAT WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE WHO PUT A GROUP TOGETHER THAT IS BALLOTS. AND QUITE FRANKLY I FIND IT TRAGIC THAT WERE ONLY DOING HEARING ENOUGH VOTING AND ALL THE MY TESTIMONY WITH I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SOME OF THEM MATHIS AND. FOR THE RECORD. AS THAT MAY BE CLEAR THAT. FIRST OF ALL I KNOW THAT EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE IS COMMITTED TO WHAT YOU DESCRIBE THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT. IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES I THINK THE ISSUE OF DOCUMENTATION. HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE BILL. I WOULD SAY THAT MANY OF US ON THIS COMMITTEE ARE INTERESTED IN CREATING A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND DOCUMENTATION. FOR THE PURPOSES OF CLARITY LET ME JUST SAY THAT THE BILL DOES NOT DESCRIBE. DOCUMENTATION WE WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE IF YOU WANT A LIFT THAT UP. BUT WE ALSO MANY OF US IN THIS COMMITTEE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN CREATING PATHWAYS FOR CITIZENSHIP WORK OPPORTUNITIES AND SAFETY FOR THE WORKERS. DEALING WITH THE WORK SHORTAGE WE THINK THAT THERE A WIN FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED WE WANTED FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE THOSE WINDS HAPPEN. AND MITIGATE ANY NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES THAT MY COM WE WELCOME YOUR HELP GOING FORWARD IN ANYONE WHO WANTS TO BE A PART OF THAT COMMERCE MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M ONE OF THE AUTHORS AND I INTEND TO WORK ON A GONE FOR GOOD FOR TO WORK WITH YOU. SOME OF THE RELIGIOUS. WHY ARE WE NOT VOTING ON THIS BILL TODAY? WE'VE. AT COMPENSATION WOULD CHAIR. AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE RAISED SOME CONCERNS. CLARIFICATIONS AS WAS JUST MENTIONED. BY TE CHAIRMAN. WE THINK THAT THERE IS UP SOME WORK TO BE DONE. IN ORDER FOR THIS BODY. TO FEEL COMFORTABLE. VOTING UP OR DOWN THE MEASURE AND SO. THE CHAIRMAN IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH. A HANDFUL OF STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE COME OUT IN OPPOSITION. SURPRISINGLY GROUPS THAT. TRADITIONALLY WOULD SUPPORT. THIS CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN. IN SO I THINK THAT HAS CREATED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF. CONCERNS. AND SO WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE. THE CHAIR AND THE. ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED. SO ORDINARILY WHEN THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL AMENDMENTS ARE SUGGESTED AND OFFERED AND. WE CAN DO THAT THIS TIME. THERE WERE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS AND DOES NOTHING CONCRETE. TURNED OUT. FROM THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU ASKING THE QUESTION AND. GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO. BELIEVE HIGHLIHT. WHAT? HAPPENED OR DIDN'T HAPPEN AND ULTIMATELY WHAT. PATH WERE TAKEN FORWARD. THANK YOU. THE REALITY IS THAT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO SPEAK TO. PLAY OUT AT A FEDERAL LEVEL WHILE THEY AFFECT US HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA IS IMPORTANT TO THIS CONVERSATION. THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS THAT CAN'T BE DEALT WITH. AND AS THE AUTHORS HAVE MENTIONED. THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE WORK TO BE DONE BY THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO FIGURE OUT A PATH MOVING FORWARD WHAT'S IRONIC IS THAT. ARE AMONG OTHERTHINGS LEGISLATION IS NOT REQUIRED. BY THIS HOUSE TO DO WHAT IT IS THAT WE SEEK TO DO HARM BUT IT IS CERTAINLY ALWAYS AN OPTION ARE I FOR ONE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS. WHO ARE WILLING TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS? I FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MOVE THESE CONCEPTS FOR. AND WHAT THE BILL IS INTENDED TO DO. APPRECIATE THE OFFICE FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DO THAT MUCH CHAIRED WORD. A WITNESS WOULD LIKE TO JUST MAKE A POINT. YES WE COULD BRIEF WEEKS I'D LIKE TO BRING UP THE SPEAKERS WHO COME FROM THE VARIOUS DISTRICTS TO TALK HERE YET AND A COUPLE OF POINTS MISTER THURMOND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THINKS SOMEONE. IN THIS COMMITTEE SAID EARLIER ON A BILL THAT WHAT WAS BEING DONE. WAS NOT WORKING. AND THAT'S WHY THE MEMBER HAD A BILL BEFORE YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU VOTED ON THAT BUILDING I THINK THAT COMMENT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE. WHAT HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED? FOR THE LAST. SEVENTEEN YEARS IN CONGRESS BY GOOD AND WELL INTENTIONED. ADVOCATES MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS SENATE IN THE HOUSE AS WELL AS ORGANIZATIONS AND INDUSTRIES EXCITER. HAS NOT WORKED. WE HAVE LESS PEOPLE BECAUSE OF DEPORTATIONS UNDER A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL FEAR FACTOR BY REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION. SO WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HAS NOT WORKED. NOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO YOUR COMMENTS. WE ANTICIPATED. ALL OF THE TYPE OF CONCERNS. THAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. I TESTIFIED OVER A HUNDRED TIMES ON THE IMMIGRATION BILL IN CONGRESS THAT CONGRESS PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR.

AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY OUR NECKLACE CHAVEZ ON BEHALF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE COMMITS YOU IN CALIFORNIA TO WORK WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ON BEHALF OF FARMWORKERS AND IMMIGRANTS. THE SAME PRESIDENT COMMITTED TO BUILD A WALL TO KEEP IMMIGRANT FARMWORKERS OUT. THE PRESIDENT CREASING WORKPLACE RAIDS QUOTE I WANT TO SEE FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT INCREASE IN WORK SITE OPERATIONS. THE PRESIDENT WHO ARRESTED TWENTY SIX FARMWORKERS ON THE WAY TO WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND A SEPARATE INCIDENT A FARM WORKER COUPLE ON THEIR WAY TO WORK KILLED IN A CAR CRASH FULFILLING ICE AGENTS LEAVING SIX ORPHANED CHILDREN. THE SW RECENTLY ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL SERVICE AND IS ORGANIZING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE CHILDREN. LAST MONTH THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS CRITICIZED HOUSE REPUBLICAN IMMIGRATION PROPOSAL. WHICH INCLUDES AN AGRICULTURAL GUEST WORKER PROPOSAL. BY REPUBLICAN BOB GOODLATTE. CALLING IT THE MASS DEPORTATION ACT. THIS IS THE CONTEXT FOR CONSIDERING AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. GOVERNOR BROWN RECENTLY STATED IMMIGRATION DEBATE. HAS BECOME INFLAMMATORY FOOTBALL THAT VERY LOW LIFE POLITICIANS LIKE TO EXPLOIT. THE OF W. AGREES. CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOCUS ON INCREASING WAGES AND IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS. FOR FARMWORKERS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOCUS ON PROTECTING FARMWORKERS WHO ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. THESE ARE POLICIES YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT HERE AND NOW. THE NUMBER OF FARMWORKERS HAS NOT CHANGED IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT THE EMPLOYMENT OF DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ON FILE AND CULTURE. WE DON'T HAVE A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS WE HAVE A SHORTAGE A CALIFORNIA BASED POLICIES. THAT HELP IN FOR FARMWORKERS ARE NOT FALLING BEHIND ALL OF THEIR WORKERS. FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSE. WE RECENTLY HAD SOME INITIAL DIALOGUE. WITH THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUING THIS DIALOGUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WE ARE APPRECIATIVE AGAIN LIKE THE AUTHORS AND THOSE WHO OPPOSE SO WILLING TO COME TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. THAT ARE IN THIS BILL ANYONE ELSE WHO WAS HERE SPEAK IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU SIR. ANYONE ELSE IS GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE RESPONSES A TRAIL OF THE CALL THIS REMAINING RIGHTS AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. NO I BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. Q. ANYONE ELSE WHO'D COME TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. I WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR IF HE WANTS A CHANCE TO ADDRESS ANYTHING IN THE COURSE OF MEMBERS UP QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WILL TAKE THOSE AS WELL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I I WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. AS A SAID EARLIER A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. ARE ARE FEDERALLY RELATED AND THEIR ECONOMIC THEIR HUMANITARIAN IMMIGRATION SOME OF THEM MANY OF THEM ARE BIGGER THAN WHAT THE STATE CAN DO BUT. THEY ALL IMPACT OUR STATE I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK ON THEM. I SEE TODAY IS A START. WE DON'T AGREE ON ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THIS BILL BUT I THINK EVERYONE AGREES THAT WE OUGHT TO DO MORE. TO SUPPORT IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE HAS TO LIVE IN FEAR WORK IN FEAR AS A WORKER AS A STUDENT AS A FAMILY MEMBER. AS A LOVE ONE AND WE TAKE THOSE ISSUES TO HEART WE DON'T WANT ANYONE TO HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR WE DON'T WANT ANYONE. TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION AND. I HAVE OFFERED. THE SUPPORT OF OF OUR OFFICE AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE AUTHOR. WITH UFW WITH OTHERS WHO HAVE FEELINGS ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES AND WORKERS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T PUT THEM AT RISK FOR DEPORTATION FROM HIS TREATMENT OR FOR ANY KIND OF ABUSE OR EXPLOITATION. WE CARE ABOUT THE WORK SHORTAGE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A WORKFORCE THAT IS ABLE TO DO THE WORK THAT HELPS TO KEEP OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES IN OUR STATE STRONG. AND WE CARE ABOUT OUR FAMILIES WE WANT THEM TO BE SUPPORTED AND SECURE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE'VE COMMITTED TO KEEP HAVING THIS CONVERSATION UNTIL WE IRONED OUT THE BEST WAYS. TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO I THINK THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY I ASK WITH THEIR PATIENTS AND KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WERE JUST BEGINNING. AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AT UNTIL WE GET IT DONE. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER A GONZALEZ FLETCHER SO I WANT TO THANK YOU I KNOW THAT. THAT. TO SAY THE SLAPPING CORNY I KNOW YOUR HEARTS PEER IN LESS AYE I KNOW AND THAT YOU CARE DEEPLY AS. WE ALL DO WE DO FOR IT FOR THESE WORKERS IN PARTICULAR. IT WAS NICE NO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING. A FARMER WHO. YOU KNOW I DESPERATELY WISHED A A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE SAID SOME OF THINGS WE HEARD TODAY IN NOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WORKERS IT'S NOT GONNA BE DONE BY ROBOTS WHERE. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO RESPECT ON THE WORK WE WORK SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WE WORK AS MANY HOURS AS IT TAKES ALL THE THINGS THAT I HEARD. REMINDED ME OF WHY IN FACT WE WE OUT WORK SO HARD TO CHANGE THE RULES. FOR FORMER GOVERNOR TIME. AND OUT. THERE IS A BENEFIT TO THAT. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE UNDERSTAND THAT. ALL OF US WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO. IN PARTICULAR. I. TO TO. TO. FIGURE OUT A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND FIGURE OUT A PATHWAY TO RESIDENCY WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND WE WORKED HARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO PRESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO GIVE US WHAT WE DESERVE I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY FATHER CAME HERE AS A FARM WORKER. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE HE. HE CAME HERE UNDER SOME. BIZARRE CIRCUMSTANCES. WITH A GROWER. IN AN AGREEMENT AND THANK GOD HE MARRIED MY MOTHER WHO WAS A CITIZEN AND. YOU KNOW NOW IN IT IS THAT IS A. LEGAL RESIDENT NOW. I ALWAYS WORRY. ABOUT. WHERE WE GO WITH THIS DISCUSSION? BECAUSE MY DAD DID. PUT UP WITH VERY HARD WORKING VERY HARD CONDITIONS IT'S WAS BEFORE A LOT OF THE PROTECTIONS WE HAVE TODAY. IN HE DID IT BECAUSE OF. THE HOPE OF WHAT WOULD BE EXISTING FOR HIM IN THE FUTURE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AS WE CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERN. IS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A LABOR SHORTAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THAT HOPE FOR IN REPLACE IT SIMPLY WITH A GUEST WORKER PROGRAM. THAT REQUIRES A PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING US THEIR HARD WORK AND LABOR IN FEEDING OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY AS WE HEARD IN GIVING US EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE. THAT THAT WE ARE USING THEM AS LABOR ONLY IN NOT PROVIDING THE HOPE FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT THEY CAME HERE FOR IN THAT THEY SACRIFICE THEIR BODIES FOR SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN REMAIN HERE. AND AND SO AM I I AM HOPEFUL AND THANKFUL FOR THE UFW FOR LEADING THAT FIGHT. IN DC THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR THE SPINE DC BECAUSE WE. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT A. A SOLUTION. DOES NOT TAKE AWAY THE RIGHTS OF THE WORKERS IT DOESN'T TAKE A WIFE WAY THE RIGHTS OF THEIR FAMILIES IT PROVIDES A PATHWAY FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO STAY HERE. AND THAT WERE NOT LOOKING AT FARMWORKERS OR ANY OTHER NECESSARY. WORKER AS SIMPLY. THE LABOR THAT THEY PRODUCE. BECAUSE WE KNOW AND I KNOW. AT ALL OF YOU THAT HAS BY NO. YOU'RE ALL FAMILIES YOUR PEOPLE YOUR NEIGHBORS YOU KNOW YOU WERE MIGHT FIT MY FAMILY WAS IN THIS WORK SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT% OUT THERE BECAUSE THIS THIS BILL MADE ME NERVOUS AND I THINK WE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT. BUT I DO APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION I HOPE WE. WITHOUT THE BILL CAN CONTINUE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING MAYBE SO WE COULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WORKS MAYBE WE CAN WORK WITH OUR OUR FOLKS. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY I ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO LOOK AT THOSE EMPLOYERS AND SAY YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE PRESENT UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE TO THOSE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE SUPPORTED TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE BECAUSE SEEN. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES AND OUR LIVES THE POWER TO CHANGE THIS IS IN THE VERY PEOPLE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO THAT THE EMPLOYERS WHO ARE TESTIFYING SUPPORTED PUT IN OFFICE. AGREED HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD BY THEM AND IT IS TIME THAT THEY HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT COME TO DEMOCRATIC STATE OF CALIFORNIANS SAY WE HAVE TO FIX THIS ONE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY. WHAT DO WE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN WE'VE TRIED AYE EVEN AFTER PASSING SB FIFTY FOUR WEEK WE HAVE? SOME THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS BILL GOING AROUND AND TRYING TO UNDO THAT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR. ABOUT WHO IS DOING WHAT IN THE STATE WHO IS WORKING SO HARD TO PROTECT OUR IMMIGRANT POPULATION IN THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY. AYE I WILL GO WITH ANY EMPLOYER TO TO WASHINGTON DC I DON'T THINK THOSE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS OR THE PRESIDENT WANT TO SEE ME. BUT I WOULD GO IN SUPPORT THAT BUT THAT'S WHERE THE CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN I DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THAT WE CAN DO EVERYTHING WE CAN WILL CONTINUE TO THAT I KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIS AUTHOR. AND THE CHAIR TO DO THAT BUT I REALLY WANT ENCOURAGE. THE PRESSURE TO PUSH AS FAR BACK TO THOSE EMPLOYERS AS POSSIBLE WHO DO HAVE THAT YOU'RE OF THOSE FOLKS. THANK YOU AMERICA CELLS FLETCHER SOME MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO WANT TO ECHO MY THINKS OF OF THE AUTHOR AND I'M ACTUALLY GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE NOT VOTING ON THIS TODAY BECAUSE BECAUSE WE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER. HAVE CONVERSATIONS NOT JUST WITH THE AUTHOR BUT THE OTHER. OF A JOINT AUTHORS AS WELL AS OF THE CHAIR AND A THIRD. OUR TO PEOPLE THAT I HAVE GREAT GRAY MAN RESPECT AND TRUST IN IS THE CHAIR OF THE AUTHOR TO BE ABLE LEAST TO HAVE AN HONEST FORTHRIGHT CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE THAT YOU'VE ALREADY BEGUN. AND CONTINUE TO DO IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO I KNOW. EVEN BEYOND TODAY'S CONVERSATION. I'M AND YOU KNOW I I I BECAUSE SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS OF FROM HIS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AND YOU KNOW FROM ONE OF THE THAT. OTHER AUTHORS I WON THE JOINT AUTHORS SAID THAT. YOU KNOW THAT THIS WORKFORCE DRIVES OUR ECONOMY. AND THAT'S THE CASE THEN WE SHED EIGHTY VOTES ON THE ASSEMBLY. THAT SUPPORT A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND PRACTITIONER HAD EIGHTY VOTES ON FARM WORK OVERTIME THAT'S REALLY HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THIS WORKFORCE. AND. BUT I ALSO FEAR SETTING FALSE EXPECTATIONS AND FRANKLY EVEN WITH S. B. FIFTY FOUR RIGHT. AND LABELING ESSENTIALLY WHAT HAVE YOU. THEY'RE STILL RAISE A HAPPEN THE CAPITAL SILICON VALLEY AND SAN JOSE AS WELL AS AND. AND FOREIGN COUNTRY. SO THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH POWER WE HAVE AND DON'T HAVE. THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE DON'T WE CAN DO TO PROTECT OUR OUR OUR. I RESIDENTS THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS WE CAN'T DO. AND SO. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. IT AND AND ONE I KNOW ONE OF THE BETWEEN AUTHORS ALSO ROOMS OR FOR DEBT. KIND OF FEAR BEING INSTALLED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE AND I JUST THINK THAT THAT. IT IS NOT A REALITY WE TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FEAR BECAUSE YOU ACTION HAVE MEMBERS YOUR COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN DETAINED AND DEPORTED. BY ISIS VERSES. YOU KNOW AND THE REALITY OF THAT HAPPENING. AND THEN THE FEAR THAT'S IS STILL BECAUSE OF NOT JUST RHETORIC BUT ACTIONS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THAT ARE DIVIDING OF SO WHO CREATING ALLEGE OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S THAT'S. CREATING INTENTIONAL FEAR IN OUR COMMUNITY. IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT THING AND WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ESPECIALLY HAVE MAJOR EMPLOYERS THE HEART OF OUR ECONOMY. WHICH IS THE FARMERS IN THE WORKERS THAT WORK ON THOSE FARMS. AND YET. THAT ECONOMY IS NOT HOLDING THE WHITE HOUSE ACCOUNTABLE. GOT HOLDING THAT THE CONGRESS ACCOUNTABLE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT REALLY. SHOULD BE PROTECTING THIS ECONOMY. SO SHOULD WE AS CALIFORNIANS DO WILL BE CAN TO PROTECT US ECONOMY AND PROTECT AGRICULTURAL WORKERS ABSOLUTELY IN FACT I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ON TIME AGAIN INCLUDING THE AUTHOR. THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO STAND UP FOR THESE WORKERS I WILL CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR THESE WORKERS. BUT. AT THE END OF THE DAY. NO WHAT ASSURANCES DO WE HAVE. IF WE DO HAVE HAVE LIVED F WE'RE COMFORTABLE AND WE PROVIDE TO D. H. IF WE COME THAT THE GOVERNOR'S CUP ALTHOUGH WE DO WE HAVE A TASK FORCE WORKING GROUP. AND WE PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION DHS. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION NOT UNDER. OBAMA OR THE BUSH OR EVEN REAGAN WHO PROVIDED AMNESTY. UNDER THIS ADMINISTRATION WHAT ASSURANCES DO WE HAVE THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR I USE UNDER DIRECTION THE PRESENT ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL NOT USE THAT INFO. FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES WE DON'T. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT'S WHY STRUGGLE SO MUCH WITH THIS IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT ASSURANCE. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THIS WHITE HOUSE THAT CONTINUES TO PULL THE BALL WAY LIKE IT'S LUCY AND CHARLIE BROWN LOW BALL I'M BORED CHILDREN FOR DHAKA AND OF COURSE ISN'T. IT IS NOT OR HAVING TEAMS HAS COME IN THE OFFICE A. S. FOR ALL BUT INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND THERE'S NO INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND SO DOES THE CONVERSATION BUT I WANT TO CONTINUE. MODEL BUT THE AUTHOR I IN THE DAYS AHEAD OF THE BORG COMES BACK ROW BOAT BECAUSE THOSE ARE REPEAL THOSE ARE VERY REAL CONCERNS AS TO WHAT WE ARE DOING IN SOME WAYS. OF OF GETTING QUITE A CREDIBILITY TO ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT DESERVE ANNOUNCEMENT BASED ON THEIR ACTUAL ACTIONS NOT JUST THEIR RHETORIC. SO. DOT DOES MY COMMENTS RIGHT NOW I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH THE AUTHOR. AFTER TODAY I TO GET JOB. HERE OF RESPONSE AS WELL AS CONVERSATION ON IT. I DO WANT TO. IN A SHORT ORDERED GOETZ AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE THE OFFICE BEEN PATIENT. BUT. QUICKLY SEE IF ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'VE COME AT COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE ON IN THEIR CONSIDERATION OF TIME I WILL BE BRIEF. WITH MY CLOSING REMARKS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. IT'S AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ONE ACT CLEARLY. FROM ALL SIDES IN WHATEVER PERSPECTIVE YOU MAY HAVE. I WANT TO JUST MAKE SOMETHING VERY CLEAR IS THAT. TODAY. WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE CONGRESS AND THIS ADMINISTRATION. TO PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION. PLAN THAT WE ALL HOPE IS REFLECTIVE OF NOT ONLY TAKING CARE OF FAMILIES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME KEEPING IN MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ECONOMIC. ASPECTS OF WHAT THESE LARGE POPULATIONS IN. CALIFORNIA IN THIS COUNTRY. PROVIDE TO PRODUCE. DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THE LIKELIHOOD. THE EXPECTATION THE ASSURANCE. IS ZERO. THAT WE WILL GET. SOME KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM FROM DC THAT WILL NEED ALL OF THE EXPECTATIONS. THAT WERE REFERRING TO. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO EMPOWER. CALIFORNIA'S ROLE. IN THIS COUNTRY. THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY OF THE WORLD. AND THE STATE THAT STRIVING. ECONOMICGROWTH OF THE UNITED STATES. TO LAND OUR VOICE. TO THE IMMIGRATION CONVERSATION IN WASHINGTON DC. ABOVE AND BEYOND THE FIFTY THREE MEMBERS THAT WE SEND TO WASHINGTON DC TO WORK ON OUR BEHALF. WHEN IN CALIFORNIA. WE SEE OURSELVES AS A DRIVING FORCE. FOR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. WHEN ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION. RIGHT TO GIVE US THE GREEN LIGHT. ON WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN GO THIS WAY OR GOAL THAT WE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES. JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT. WE OUR STATE MIGHT HAVE SOME OF THE TOUGHEST. CLEAR. DIRECTED POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IN THE WORKPLACE THIS BUILDING OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILING. AND WE'RE GONNA DRIVE IT. TO BE THE LEADERS ON THAT ISSUE. IT WOULD REALLY BE DONNING TO ME THAT AN ISSUE. AS IMPORTANT AS. IMMIGRATION. AND THE ECONOMY. WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE THAT WE WOULD. NOT CHAMPION. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO WASHINGTON DC. AND LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THEIR NEEDS TO BE A FIX EITHER THEIR. OR TO ALLOW US. TO PROVIDE A FIX HERE. AND THE FIX HERE THAT'S PRESENTED IN THIS BILL ALTHOUGH IT'S BEEN SAID. THERE ARE CONCERNS. IT CLEARLY STATES THAT WERE TRYING TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS THAT ARE WORKING HERE ON PERMITTED. GIVE GET RECEIVE A CERTAINTY. HAD COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS. AND CONTINUE CONTRIBUTING. TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO THE THESE VERY IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES THAT ARE BEFORE US. ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS OF THE PARENTS THAT ARE HERE OR OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE WORK THAT WE HEARD. FROM MORE ABOUT IN THE TESTIMONY. I DON'T THINKTHAT THAT'S SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF OUR REACH. I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW FOR SOMEONE TO SAY. WE SHOULD STAY IN OUR LANE. RIGHT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR STATE ISSUES I DON'T THINK THAT'S. ENOUGH SUBSTANCE FOR US TO DO NOTHING AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. I I BELIEVE THAT. WE HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO CHAMPION. ANOTHER ISSUE ANOTHER BECAUSE. THAT IT INTERSECTS WITH. PEOPLE ARE FAMILIES AND CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. A HUNDRED PERCENT COMMITTED TO. WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU. AND. AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDER. WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY AND. THE DIFFERENCE THAT WE CAN MAKE IN. THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANT LIVES THAT ARE HERE IN OUR STATE. WORKING IN DRIVING THE THE ECONOMY FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER. I THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE CLOSE SAYS IT ALL. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP HERE. AND FOR RIGHTFULLY SAYING THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE IN THIS CONVERSATION WHILE WE CAN'T. SET THE TABLE ARE CONTROL ALL THE ISSUES ARE TAMI. OUR DIVERSITY OUR COMPLEXITY OBVIOUSLY HAS A LOT TO DO WITH WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE NATION. AND WE ARE LEADER SO THANK YOU FOR LEADING CALIFORNIA FOR BEING A LEADER ON THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA CLOSE THIS DISCUSSION AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE. SO HE MEMBER BONTA IS HERE TO PRESENT. WELCOME SIMILAR BONTA THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU. A COMMITTEE CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. AND THANK YOU COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE. UNDER LONGSTANDING CURRENT LAW. WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE DISMISSED OR DENIED EMPLOYMENT DUE TO THEIR USE OF PRESCRIBED MEDICINES SUCH AS OPIOIDS OR TO TREAT A MENTAL OR PHYSICAL DISABILITY OR MEDICAL CONDITION. UNLESS THAT USE A MEDICINE POSES A SAFETY RISK OR CREATE AN UNDUE HARDSHIP FOR EMPLOYERS TO ACCOMMODATE. AB TWENTY SIX NINE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE MEDICAL USE OF CANNABIS AS RECOMMENDED BY DR. BE GIVEN THE EXACT SAME REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AS OTHER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT OR FEET HIGH. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL RELATES TO MEDICAL CANNABIS ONLY. WHEN A PATIENT HAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A MEDICAL DOCTOR TO USE CANNABIS TO IT DOES NOT. APPLY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM TO ADULT USE OF CANNABIS. UNDER THIS BILL EMPLOYERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL MANDATES SUCH AS TRUCK DRIVERS SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS. AND AVIATION WORKERS AS WELL AS FEDERAL GRANTEES LIKE HOSPITALS WOULD BE EXEMPT THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY TO THEM. AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE DOES NOT IN ANYWAY APPLY TO OR PROTECT EMPLOYEES WHO ARE IMPAIRED. AND UNABLE TO PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS FUNCTIONS OF THE JOB BECAUSE OF THE USE OF CANNABIS. THAT CONTINUES TO BE. ARM SOMETHING THAT'S PROHIBITED. AND WHILE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IMPAIRMENT I'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL STANDARD FOR CANNABIS IMPAIRMENT LIKE THERE IS FOR ALCOHOL IMPAIRMENT. AT WHICH WE HONOR HAS THE POINT ZERO EIGHT PERCENT BLOOD ALCOHOL. CONTENT TEST. THAT'S TRUE BUT IT'S ALSO COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES CAO ALCOHOL IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S AT ISSUE HERE IT'S NOT A A PRESCRIBED MEDICINE. AND TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE ARE NO I'M PER SE IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR ANY OF THEM THE MEDICAL. PRESCRIBE MEDICINES THAT WERE THAT WE WOULD BE AT ISSUE IN THAT IN THE WORKPLACE. I KNOW THIS THAT THERE ARE SOME COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT THAT HAVE SOME AGREED UPON LEVELS BUT BUT THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME AS PER SE IMPAIRMENT TESTS. SO. THERE'S NOTHING UNIQUE ABOUT CANNABIS THAT CAN'T BE ACCOMMODATED UNDER THE SAME FEE HAS STRUCTURE AS ALL OF THE OTHER. MEDICAL LABS AND MEDICAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT ARE BEING USED NOW. ALSO. CALIFORNIA IS OFTEN ON THE VANGUARD ON THE FRONT LINES ON THE CUTTING EDGE DOING THINGS FIRST WERE NOT HERE THERE ARE TWELVE STATES THAT ALREADY HAVE THIS LAW. I IN THOSE STATES. WE HAVEN'T HEARD A CLAMORING FROM EMPLOYERS WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM ANY PARTICULAR. A TRAITOR INDUSTRY THAT THAT THE SKY HAS FALLEN IN AND THINGS CAN NO LONGER WORK. I'M OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN STATE LAW AYE BUT WE THINK THAT IF IT CAN WORKING TWELVE OTHER STATES GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOMPLISH WE CAN ALSO. MAKE IT WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MANY WORKERS FIND THAT THAT CANNABIS CAN BE. A. ARE EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER DRUGS THAT HAVE A VERY DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS. ADDICTIVE OPIOIDS ROLLO EVER OPEN LIKE CRISIS. AND A LOT OF STUDIES HAVE SHOWN EQUIPMENT CLEAN ONE FROM DR SANJAY GUPTA THAT I WAS JUST READING THE OTHER DAY. THAT. CANNABIS CAN BE A REAL ALTERNATIVE AT TWO TWO ADDICTIVE OPIOIDS. BUT RIGHT NOW. CANNABIS PATIENTS ARE NOT GIVEN THIS ALTERNATIVE THE CAN'T USE CANNABIS MEDICAL CANNABIS AND THAT INSTEAD OF ADDICTIVE OPIOIDS AND KEEP THEIR JOB. UP RIGHT NOW THEY WILL BE THIS AT THEIR ALLOWED TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND AND LOSE THEIR JOB SIMPLY FOR USING MEDICAL CANNABIS. AND THE SEEKS TO AND THAT. NO THERE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ALREADY IN THE IN THE MARKETPLACE ALREADY BEING USED BY WORKERS IN WHO ARE EMPLOYED. AT MORE WILL WILL COME AS NEW DRUGS ARE ARE INVENTED AND ENTER THE MARKETPLACE. AND OUR ASKING IS THAT THE SAME PROCESS PROCESS THAT IS. PRESCRIBED UNDER FEE HA BE USED HERE THAT A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION BE GIVEN. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE INTERACTIVE PROCESS BEING GAUGED IN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A CONVERSATION BETWEEN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE. ABOUT A JOB THAT EMPLOYEE CAN DO ARE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT WHILE THEY ARE. TAKING MEDICINE FOR THEIR MENTAL OR OR PHYSICAL CONDITION. AND THAT THAT STRUCTURE HAS WORKED I FOR SOME MONEY AND MEDICINES UP TO NOW WE THINK IT CAN WORK FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS. AS WELL. AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE IS NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR WORKERS PATIENTS WHO ARE SICK. AGAINST NEEDLESS DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE AB TYPE TWENTY SIXTY NINE IS AN EQUITABLE REASONABLE MEASURE THAT PROTECTS PATIENTS EMPLOYERS AND THE PUBLIC. AND TREATS MEDICAL CANNABIS ACCOMPANIED BY MEDICAL DOCTORS RECOMMENDATION THE SAME AS ALL OTHER MEDICINES. IN THE WORKPLACE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION LOOK FOR TAR DIALOG I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE IS RYAN MILLER. CO FOUNDER OF OPERATION EVEN BACK EDUCATING VETERANS ABOUT CANNABIS AS WELL AS ALLEN CROWLEY AND EMPLOYMENT LAW EXPERT AT WEINBERG ROGER AND ROSENFIELD SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF YOUR CW. A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THANK YOU WE WILL HAVE LOVE FOR EACH OTHER SIDE. TWO MINUTES INTO WITNESSES. THE FIRST WITNESS FIRST WITNESS. THANK YOU MY NAME IS RYAN MILLER OF OPERATION EVAC EDUCATING VETERANS ABOUT CANNABIS. AND WE PREVENT SUICIDE AN OPIATE OVERDOSE IN MILITARY VETERANS. THROUGH CURATING COMMUNITY AND PRACTICING MINDFULNESS FORTIFIED WITH COMPASSIONATE FREE A CANNABIS ACCESS IN EDUCATION. MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS DISCHARGED HONORABLY FROM THE MARINE CORPS. I HAD A MICROSOFT AND CISCO CERTIFICATION. AND I CAME HOME ESSENTIALLY TO SILICON VALLEY. ARGUABLY THE OPTIMAL MILITARY EXPERIENCE AND TRAINING FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO CIVILIAN EQUIVALENT. HOWEVER BEING FROM A WORKING CLASS. COMMUNITY MY NETWORK WAS BLUE COLLAR FOLKS. GARBAGE MAN PLUMBERS TRADES FOLKS. AND SO I DID HAVE THE NETWORK TO GET INTO TECH AND I HAVE A LOT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY. THAT PREVENTED ME FROM. NETWORKING I IN PENETRATING THE TECH A NETWORK. SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TODAY IS IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONING. A MILITARY FOLKS INTO THE CIVILIAN SOCIETY IF YOU WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT PREVENTING SUICIDE AN OPIATE OVERDOSE ON ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT SPECIFICALLY TO EMPLOYMENT. IS ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO DO THAT. I SPENT SEVEN YEARS AT FEDEX OFFICE MAKING COPIES FOR KINKO'S AFTER I LEFT THE MILITARY. I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ANOTHER URINALYSIS TESTS AT ANOTHER. POTENTIAL EMPLOYER I WOULD DEGREE FROM GOLDEN GATE UNIVERSITY IN MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. HOWEVER. BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT SPECIFICALLY URINALYSIS TESTING HAS PREVENTED ME FROM. SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THAT TRANSITIONS SO THANK YOU FOR A. ASSEMBLYMAN BONTA IN. AB TWENTY SIXTY NINE WE CAN HELP. MOTIVATED IS BETTER TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY SO THANK YOU. MAKE YOUR NEXT WITNESS. I OR MY NAME'S ALAN CROWLEY AND I AM A LABOR EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY HAVE BEENPRACTICING WITH THE WIND RUSH ROSENTHAL FIRM FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS. AND I'VE NEGOTIATED ALL KINDS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH. DRUG ALCOHOL POLICIES. INCLUDING ONES THAT ARE IN THE SO CALLED ZERO TOLERANCE. WENT LIVE SETTINGS. EVEN PRESENTED A CONFERENCES INVOLVING A DRUG TESTING IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY SON I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DRUG TESTING IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. ALL INDUSTRIES IN FACT. AND I'VE A REPRESENTED HUNDREDS OF NOT THOUSANDS OF WORKERS IN CASES INVOLVING DRUG TESTING. SO I JUST WANT TO TRY TO DISENTANGLE A LITTLE BIT. V. A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICIES FROM REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. I THINK THAT. THEM. SO. EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN HAD DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY SINCE AT LEAST NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH. ACCOMMODATIONS SINCE THE EIGHTY EIGHT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY. AND SO THEY WOULD BE BASICALLY FOLLOWING THE EXACT SAME POLICIES AND UPDATE THAT THEY USE TO ACCOMMODATE. EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT THEY DO FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS EXACT SAME PROCESS. AND SO CURRENTLY IF AN EMPLOYER HAS A DRUG FREE POLICY IT TYPICALLY STATES THAT THE EMPLOYEE HAS TO INFORM THE EMPLOYER. ESPECIALLY FOR THE DANGERS OPERATION THAT THEY MAY BE TAKING MEDICATION THAT MAY IMPAIR THEIR ABILITY TO WORK. AND. AND THEN. BUT IF THE EMPLOYEE IS SUBJECT TO DRUG TESTING. AND DOESN'T INFORM THE EMPLOYER THEN CASE LAW HOLDS VERY CLEARLY THAT THE EMPLOYER CAN TERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE NEVER MENTIONED IT TO THE AMP TO THE EMPLOYER. SO CURRENTLY EMPLOYERS EASILY I HAVE WE HAVE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS TO MILLIONS OF EMPLOYEES WHO. HAVE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS THAT. CAN MAKE HIM DROWSY THAT CAN MAKE THEM DISEASE THAT CAN MAKE IT CAN AFFECT IMPAIRMENT. AND. THOSE PRESCRIPTION THOSE EMPLOYEES OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. IF THEY'RE IN A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENTS. THEIR FOR THEIR OBLIGATION IS IS TO INFORM THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY TAKE THE MEDICATION. IF THEY DON'T AND THEY ARE DRUG TESTED. V. EMPLOYER IS LEGALLY ALLOWED TO TERMINATE THE EMPLOYEE FOR FOR NOT REPORTING AND FOR FEELING THE DRUG TEST. IF THE EMPLOYEE THEN SAYS I WANT A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION BECAUSE OF THIS. HOPE YOU A PRESCRIPTION FOR LIKE AND WHAT. THAT'S YOU CAN GET RETROACTIVE ES DE ACCOMMODATION. SO SO BASICALLY VIS VIS HER EMPLOYERS OF AN OPERATING. AND AND AND AND IN DEALING WITH EMPLOYEES YOU COULD REQUEST REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ARE IN THE SAME ENVIRONMENT WITH A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE AREAS SO IT'S IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS. SO. AND AND THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTEND MEDICAL CANNABIS. EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE MEDICAL CANCER TRIPS PRESCRIPTIONS WOULD EXTEND THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION PROCESS TO THE VERY MINIMAL PROCESS. SO AN EMPLOYEE. JUST SIMPLY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA TO ASK FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. THE EMPLOYER GETS TO CHOOSE THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. THE EMPLOYEE CAN SUGGESTS. ACCOMMODATIONS BUT IT IS UP TO THE EMPLOYER TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. IF THE EMPLOYER BELIEVES THAT THE EMPLOYEE CANNOT SAFELY. PERFORM THE ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF THE JOB. THE EMPLOYER CAN ASK EMPLOYEE FOR CERTAIN OF MEDICAL. DOCUMENTS SAYING CAN YOU TO PERFORM IS THIS. FUNCTIONS THAT'S UP TO THE EMPLOYER TO DECIDE IF THE EMPLOYEE CAN PERFORM THAT WORK WHETHER THERE HAVE A PRESCRIPTION FOR LIKE IT IN OR NARCO OR BENZODIAZEPINES OR MEDICAL CANNABIS. AND SO. IF THE EMPLOYER APPROVES OF THE ACCOMMODATION OF THEN THE EMPLOYEE CAN WORK IF THEY CAN'T THEN THE IT AND IT GOT TO THE PROCESS. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY EXTENDS A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR AT LEAST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS. TO MILLIONS OF WORKERS THAT YOU USE PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS TO. EMPLOYEES WHO NOW USE MEDICAL CANNABIS IT'S THE SAME PROCESS. I CAN GET YOU TO WRAP SIR YEAH SURE SITE IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE QUESTIONS I'D I KNOW THE DETAILS OF THESE LAWS EXTREMELY WELL AND BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS. AND SO. I'M CERTAIN THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS FOR YOU TODAY OKAY. DODD AYE AYE LET'S GO LITTLE LONGER BECAUSE THIS IS OBSCENE TRY TO NEW TERRITORY AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO GET STATED WILL GIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO THE OPPOSITION. AND SHOULD BE NEED.

CAN WE MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THEM AT THE TABLE PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MARTY FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND SURPRISE. OF. WE THOUGHT WELL WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION OF THIS TIME WE ARE REVIEWING THE AMENDMENT STILL. ARE TRYING TO FIND A PATH FORWARD OF WITH THIS WILL HOPEFULLY BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT AT THIS TIME WE ARE STILL IN OPPOSITION AND OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. STILL REMAIN SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE AND OF THE LACK OF A TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT. HI AND GOOD AFTERNOON MICROBES INHERENTLY HAVE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS ON. AT QWEST HAS I AM. QUITE A COUPLE FEW COMMENTS HERE I'M OPPOSED TO THE BILL AND BASICALLY POSTED BASICALLY EVEN THE UNDERLYING PREMISE THE PREMISES LAID OUT BY THE AUTHOR IN IN THE IN THE FACT SHEET. I'M THAT THERE SOME FINDINGS IN THE BILL THAT DISCUSS THE FACT THAT I THE FDA HASN'T FOUND. DRUG TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE BE SAFER EFFECTIVE IN AND WE JUST CHALLENGE THAT. THE THAT SINCE SINCE DRUG TESTING IN THE WORKPLACE IS HAS BEEN INSTITUTED BACK IN THE NINETIES. ON DRUG USE IN THE WORKPLACE HAS CONSISTENTLY GONE DOWN EXCEPT IN YEARS WHERE YOU KNOW MARIJUANA HAS BEEN LEGALIZED IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND AT SPIKE'S A LITTLE BUT THEN IT GOES DOWN. AND AND AND THE FACT IS IS A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE IS A SAFER PLACE THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSE HAS HAS. STATISTICS I MEAN THAT THAT THE THE WORKPLACE IS MORE PRODUCTIVE THERE'S LESS INJURIES ARE LESS WORKERS COMP COMPENSATION CLAIMS. IT IS IT IS IT IT LEADS TO SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE JUST WOULD YOU KNOW. CHALLENGE THAT THAT IN THE FINDINGS. AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO AND NECESSARILY COMPARE CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT PICTURE THAT THE WITH THE WAY IT. MARIJUANA IT'S MET MEDICAL MARIJUANA STREET IN THE WORKPLACE ON THE BACK AND IN THEM AND EMPLOYMENT SIDE WITH OTHER STATES YOU KNOW THE DISTANCE THING WITH TWELVE STATES ARE TEN STATES. THAT THE FRONT END OF THIS IS DIFFERENT THE STATE'S WE SHOULD YOU KNOW AS AS AS A SOMEONE BONTA NOTED THINGS ARE YOU KNOW THERE IS A BIT OF APPLES AND ORANGES HERE SOME SOME STATES HAVE. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THEY HAVE DUBBED THE. WHAT LEADS TO A PRESCRIPTION? IS DIFFERENT AND HOW IT'S PRESCRIBED ON ON HOW OFTEN IT'S PRESCRIBED AND THE. THAT THE SOME STATES REQUIRE RENEWAL OF THAT SOME STATES HAVE A HARD AND FAST RULE ON A CARD SO WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE THE PRINT THE BASIS FOR WHICH YOU ARE. YOU PATTY YOUSEF CALIFORNIA ON THEM FINALLY. WE DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE EACH AND WE SHOULD BE EQUATING. MEDICAL MARIJUANA USE AND AND AND OPIATES IN THE IN THE WORKPLACE THAT DAY CLEARLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH OPIOIDS AND THERE'S A DOZEN BILLS AND LEGISLATURE TRYING TO UNRING THAT BELL. WHAT AT WHATEVER WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA THAT LED TO THIS PROLIFERATION OF OPIATES IN THE WORKPLACE? SHOULD BE SHOULD BE FIXED BUT WE SHOULDN'T SAY ALL THE WAY TO FIX IT IS ASSIST ALLOWED MORE MEDICAL MARIJUANA I MEAN MEDICAMENT MARIJUANA IS STILL ADDICTIVE I MEAN THEY'RE IN THE IN THE IT'S IT'S THERE'S THERE IS A. THERE IN THE NATIONAL TO SOME DRUG ABUSE YOU KNOW THIRTY PERCENT OF A PEOPLE ON WHICH YOU CAN USE IT VERY REGULAR USE OF MARIJUANA CHAU. ADDICTIVE TENDENCIES AND SOME PERCENT OF THOSE HAVE AN ADDICTION AND SO WE WE SHOULDN'T JUST KIND OF TRADE ONE ADDICTION THING FOR ANOTHER ADDICTION THING SO WE ASK YOU TO. HOLD THIS BONE COMMITTEE MAYBE MAYBE SAID ON THIS FOR AWHILE AND LET'S SEE HOW HOW THE WHOLE MARIJUANA THING CALIFORNIA SHAKES OUT BEFORE WE START CHANGING EMPLOYMENT LAW. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU OTHERS WHO WISH TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION. I. MISTER CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNMENT HAVE THE CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION WE ENTER INTO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH THE WEINBERG FUHRMAN HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON. YOUR. THANK YOU. MR MEMBERS GENERALLY ABOUT THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION MAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INCREASED LIABILITY FOR EMPLOYERS. OPPOSE THANK YOU.

THERE STILL GIVENS WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION ALSO OPPOSED. THANK YOU. JAMIE CON ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS AND WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS BUT WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH BILL AND HAVE TO BE UP AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE ADDING ON IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOU KNOW I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS FOR THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE. ISSUE THERE'S OTHERS I IT'S IT'S COMPLEX ISSUE. LA AND UNDER A LOT OF THEM REGARDING CANNABIS RIGHT NOW I MEAN I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IS WE'RE TRYING TO SORT ALL THIS OUT. IT DEFTLY BALANCES LOT OF ISSUES WITH WORKER RIGHTS OF PATIENT RIGHTS WITH EMPLOYER RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES TO ALL THEIR EMPLOYEES AND OF COURSE WORKPLACE SAFETY WHICH WE ALL. YOU KNOW TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY IN THIS BUILDING FOR CERTAIN. AND I DO THINK AGAIN ON EARLIER BILL. THAT WHERE THERE WAS SOME MIX. THE CHAMBERS SAMPLERS EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN EARLIER BILL AND I CIVIL. YOU KNOW I DIDN'T TAKE THOSE CONCERNS. IN THE SAME WAY I THINK THESE ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS AND I THINK THAT WE ALL SHOULD REALLY BE STOP ABOUT IT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT. LOOK LIKE THE DRUG. THE DRUG FREE WORKPLACE. HE A IT'S ON ACCIDENT BUT NOT ALL THINGS ARE IN EIGHTY EIGHT. IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF THE WAR A WAR ON DRUGS WAS JUST SAY NO. AND IT WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON ILLEGAL DRUGS. AB AND A STREET DRUGS AND KIND OF THAT WERE RUNNING RAMPANT. THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY AT THAT TIME THERE'S A LOT REASONS WHY THEY WERE OF I'M NOT GONNA GET INTO. BUT. THAT THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY AT EIGHTY EIGHT. WAS MADE A VERY CLEAR AWAY JUST LIKE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. THOSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THOSE DRUGS ACTUALLY I MEDICINALLY PRESCRIBED WE'RE NOT REFERRING TO THOSE BECAUSE THOSE ACTUALLY HAVE A BENEFIT AND IT DONE PROPERLY AND EMPLOYERS INFORMED. AND APPROPRIATE MANNER A YOU CAN ALLOW FOR REASON ACCOMMODATION BOUGHT THE SAME TIME ENSURING THAT THERE'S WORKPLACE SAFETY BECAUSE OF ONE IS IMPAIRED I'D END OF THE DAY. DOTS THAT TAKES PRECEDENCE THAT YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD NEVER ALLOW SOMEONE TO PUT ANYONE ELSE CLEAN THEMSELVES IN DANGER. I AND SO YOU KNOW THAT THE REALITY IS THAT. BICU GIVEN THE FACT THERE'S AN ACCEPTABLE LEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THERE'S PLENTY OF FOLKS. THAT USE CANNABIS OFFER MEDICINAL PURPOSES FROM THE YOU KNOW THE HAVE LOW LEVELS OF TEENAGE SCENE THEY BENEFIT FROM A HIGHER LEVEL OF CBD. THERE ARE. WELL KNOWN. AND SCIENTIFICALLY SHOWN MEDICINAL BENEFITS SO AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE HAVE AN EXCEPTION FOR LEGAL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS THAT THE EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN ABLE. TO ACCOMMODATE TWO EIGHTY A THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T DO THE SAME FOR CANNABIS THE QUESTION. THAT THIS COMES DOWN TO IS DOUG DO YOU BELIEVE OR DOES VALUE BELIEVE DOES CANNABIS PROVIDE LEGITIMATE MODESTO MEDICINAL BENEFITS. SCIENTIFICALLY IT SHOWS THAT IS SHOWN THAT IT DOES NOT A MATTER OF BELIEF. EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES IF YOU'RE STILL THINKING BACK ON THE REEFER MADNESS DAYS. THAT'S YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE THAT OPINION. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT CANNABIS DOES PROVIDE MEDICINAL BENEFITS AND THAT THAT'S THE CASE THERE SHOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE THAT HAS. CANNABIS THROUGH BEFORE MEDICINAL PURPOSES TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS THAT SOMEONE THAT HAS PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND PAINKILLERS AND ABOUT A THOUSAND OTHER TYPES OF PRESCRIPTION. DRUG REMEDIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. AND THAT THE BALL THE SAME STEPS ON THE SAME PROCESS HE'S THAT DOES WORKERS DO AS WELL. I AND SO OUT OF FOR THOSE REASONS ON MY SUPPORT THE BILL I DO THINK THAT THERE'S STILL AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I KNOW. KNOWING THE AUTHOR I KNOW THAT THERE STILL WILL BE WORK DONE ON SOME OF THE DETAILS OF HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES ARE RECONCILED TO A TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. BECAUSE AGAIN. THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS ACCOUNT FOR THAT THAT WOULD THAT THAT SAFETY IS NEVER COMPROMISED AND SO I CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD. BUT I'M CERTAINLY GOING TO VOTE AYE. TODAY IN AND HELPED MOVE THE BILL RIGHT NOW. IF THERE'S A SECOND. AND AND WHEN I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THOSE IN OPPOSITION THAT WAS IT WAS. GOOD TO HEAR THAT THERE WERE SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM OPPOSITION ON THE WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE. A SIMILAR GONZALEZ FLETCHER FOLLOWED BY SOME MOMENTUM MCCARTY. SO IS HELPFUL TO OUR LOOK. ASK SOME QUESTIONS OF THE BUILDING TRADES AT. I DON'T SEE THEM HERE. SO. I WAS ON THE FENCE I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID TODAY BOTH ON BOTH SIDES WHICH MAKES IT REALLY HARD I MEAN THIS IS. IT'S LIKE I GET IT WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUT THE SAFETY ISSUES IN PARTICULAR SAFETY ISSUES IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES THE HOSPITAL'S SOME OF OUR. WHO ARE SENSITIVE WORK PLACES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS? MAKE THIS COMPLICATED SO I HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW. PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE NOW USED AND WHETHER THAT NOTICE IS GIVEN AT THE HIRING HALLS OR IS IT IT NOT IN A. IN A WORKERS NOT DISPATCHED TO A JOB SITE OR GIVEN TO THE EMPLOYEE I DON'T KNOW IF. IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT OF IF SOMEBODY COULD ANSWER THAT. SOME OF OUR GONZALEZ FLETCHER. WE ARE ON THE LETTER NOW POSITION WITH THE BUILDING TRADES IN OUR MY MEMBERS ARE SIGNATORY THE CARPENTERS AND LABOR'S AGREEMENTS. THE WAY. I READ THIS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AS THE ATTORNEY SAID. WORKERS AND PROSPECTIVE WORKERS TO THOSE FROM A HIRING HALL ARE OBLIGATED TO TELL THE EMPLOYER IF THEY WANT PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS TODAY. I AS HE SAID FAILURE TO TELL EMPLOYER WOULD RESULT IN TERMINATION. IF A WORKER FROM THE HALL IS TELLS US WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN THEM TO THE HIRING HALL. WE ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT AT THE EMPLOYERS SOLE DISCRETION NOT TO DISPATCH THE WORKER AND AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF A WORKER TELLS US THEY AREN'T OPIOIDS THEY WILL NOT BE DISPATCHED TO THE JOB SITE TODAY. IF THAT WORKER LATER DOESN'T TELL US OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE TERMINATED IF THEY TASK HIGHER THAN THE PERMISSIBLE LEVELS THEY ARE TERMINATED. SO THAT'S HOW THAT PROCESS WORKS TODAY OUR COLLECTIVE ARGUMENTS ALSO SPEAK TO MARIJUANA. AND SAY ARE YOU KNOW EXIT TERMINATING OFFENSE THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF STATE LAWS CALTRANS FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE STATE HAS ITS OWN DRUG WE FREE WORKPLACE RULE AS IT APPLIES TO CONTRACTS WHICH WOULD RESULT IN CESSATION OF THE PROJECT. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL THERE ARE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE FACTORED IN WE WILL BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH STATE CONTRACTS. IF A WORKERS TEST POSITIVE ALSO WE HAVE THE HIGHEST WORK COMP RATES OF ANY INDUSTRY ONE IN FIVE. FATALITIES A CURRENT CONSTRUCTION ON SO IT IS A UNIQUE SETTING. AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE ASKED FOR AN EXEMPTION IN THIS ARENA. BECAUSE WE DO WE DO HAVE A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY TODAY FOR OPIOIDS. YET I THINK WHAT MY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR EARLIER I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY OF HAVING WORKED WITH A LOT OF WORKERS I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT YOU NOW AT. THE SAME HIRING HALLS IN THE SAME UNIONS HIGHER. THEY HAVE A BROAD AND. ARRAY OF FOLKS THEY'RE WILLING TO HIGHER IN A LOT OF THE POLICIES WE PUT FORWARD IN THIS. IN IN THIS HOUSE TO SAY YOU SHOULD BE IN NOW LOOK PAST PEOPLE'S PAST ADAM. INDISCRETIONS. ARE ARE ARE. DONE WITH JOY IN THE BUILDING TRADES AND A LOT OF THINGS EXCUSE BUT I'M THERE'S A NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKERS. WHO'VE GONE THROUGH THINGS IN THEIR PASTOR ARE ACTUALLY STAYING CLEAN AND SO AM I I THINK I'M SENSITIVE TO IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN AND I'VE SEEN HOW THE BUILDING TRADES OF CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES IN. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD AYE AT SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT RATE WE HAVE A COMMITMENT THAT IS A SPACE FOR WE'RE GONNA. WORK ON ON. THE DRUG FREE. WORKPLACE ISSUES AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD AND WE HAD BRIEF CONVERSATION I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THIS. I WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE I DON'T. UNDERSTAND. CANNABIS ENOUGH AND I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTS RAMMING THAT I THOUGHT THAT THE PRESCRIPTION WHAT NOT LIKE THAT. WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE? CALL LOWERED. THE POLICY EXPERTS. WHEN ORDER I WAS MAKING AND I MEAN THAT THE SUIT MIGHT YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE SOME EXCELLENT. NOW JUST CHECKING. MR FLORENCE YOU TWO AND NOW I'M I'M TEASING AND. YOU TOLD ME SO MY IN VISIONING. PRESCRIPTIONS FOR MATT MEDICAL MARIJUANA MAY BE OUTDATED. INSIDE I THINK I WAS GIVING REALLY BAD EXAMPLES OF LAKE SO THAT YOU KNOW I I SAW THE LITTLE. OFFICES THAT WERE SET UP AND YOU GO IN THERE AND YOU SAY I HAVE A HEADACHE YOU GET A PRESCRIPTION. YOU YOU A SERVICEMAN I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT WITH THE CHANGE IN THE LAW THAT'S CHANGED. IS THAT CORRECT. YES WE WE ADDRESSED. THE ISSUE OF. GETTING A ADOPTED RECOMMENDATION TO BE LICENSED PHYSICIAN AND YOU HAVE TO BE AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'VE DONE AND EXAMINATION OF THE PATIENT BEFORE YOU'VE GIVEN THEM THE RECOMMENDATION FOR FOR MEDI. CANADA SO WE THINK WITH THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE LICENSING WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO BE AN ATTENDING PHYSICIAN. FRANKLY WITH WITH. WITH ADULT USE THERE'S LESS. SEEKING OUT OF MEDICAL. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT EVIL ANY OF THAT WORK. WHAT'S THAT UNTIL PEOPLE MONEY IS AT WORK POSSIBLY AM IF IF THEY'RE IN A BUT THAT RELIGION OF PATIENTS WITH A DETERMINED MEDICAL CONDITION AND EMPLOYER CAN ASK FOR PROOF OF THAT MEDICAL CONDITION. HOW OFTEN DOES A PATIENT HAVE TO RENEW? THAT PRESCRIPTION. BUT IS IT UNLIMITED I I I'M JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS OR I'M SORRY I KNOW THIS IS. IT ARE CORRECT ANSWER THE QUESTION SHORT SWORD EMPLOYEE SEEKING PROTECTIONS UNDER THIS BILL WOULD HAVE TO PRESENT TO THE EMPLOYER THAT THEY'RE SEEKING ACCOMMODATION AND THEN THERE'S A JOINT THEIR DISCUSSION. AND. ABOUT WHETHER THAT. PRESCRIPTION IS GOOD ENOUGH IS INSTRUCTIVE ENOUGH TO THE EMPLOYER. AND WHETHER THE EMPLOYER'S WILLING TO ACCOMMODATE EMPLOYEE TO SAFELY PERFORM FUNCTIONS BASED JUST UPON IN IF IT'S IF IT'S NOT A VERY SOLID RISK PRESCRIPTION. OR SOMETHING MORE. SO THE EMPLOYER CONTROLS THE PROCESS OF INTERACTIVE PROCESS AND IN IT IT AND IF IT'S AN UNSATISFIED WITH A. POORLY DRAFTED PRESCRIPTION. THE EMPLOYER CAN DENY THE ACCOMMODATION. SO NOW AN EMPLOYER WHO HAS NO MEDICAL. KNOWLEDGE AT ALL IS GOING TO EVALUATE WHETHER THIS IS A REAL PRESCRIPTION OR. KIND OF LIKE WE GET BY BECAUSE. WE DON'T WANT HEADACHES PRESCRIPTION. I I DON'T MEAN TO MINIMIZE AND I IN NO WAY GUYS I I. TOTALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REAL I'M JUST. WE ALL NOW RIGHT AND A PLAIN PEOPLE THAT WE GOT A CARD HILL. RIGHT HOW LATE IT NEEDED WELL I'M JUST IT JUST TO JUMP IN A QUICK AT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE MEDICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LICENSE PHYSICIANS NEED TO BE RENEWED EVERY YEAR SO TO ADD ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IT HAD UNLIMITED I'M SORRY I JUST I I NEVER SEEN WHETHER YOU COULD CONTINUE TO GET ONE EACH YEAR IF YOU CONTINUE TO QUALIFY FOR IT IF I GOT A PRESCRIPTION SO IT'S NOT LIKE. I'M PAIN KILLERS RIGHT IT PAINKILLERS TO GET A PRESCRIPTION FILLS A CERTAIN DO I GET A PRESCRIPTION IT'S LIKE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT. FOR YET ANOTHER PRESCRIPTION IT'S THAT IT'S A IT'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU CAN USE MEDICAL CARD OUT OF IT I AM I DON'T THINK IT IDENTIFIES QUANTITIES MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE CAN SHARE. OKAY IS THERE ANY OTHER. DRUG THAT IS PRESCRIBED IN THAT MANNER. WORDS YOU CAN UTILIZE THIS. IN YOUR SELF REGULATING THAT DOSAGES THAT AMOUNTS LIKE ALL ALL OVER THE COUNTER. CAN YOU NOT THAT'S MY PRESCRIPTION NOT NUMBERS COULD NOT SURE. OKAY SO THESE ARE AYE AYE. NO YOU DON'T NEED MY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE WHO I'M SURE PASSING THIS THROUGH BUT I'M I'M. GOING TO GIVE. MY VOTE TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WORK ON TO SOMETHING I JUST REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS MISSING. AND THIS IS ONE OF MY BASIC QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT IN THIS SITUATION SO WHAT I ENVISION A MAYBE I HAVE THIS WRONG AND I'M WILLING U. S. COME IN AND TEACH ME BECAUSE. NOW. MY FAULT FOR STAYING AWAY FROM OTHERS CAMPUS POLICY. SO MUCH OF WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING IS. I DON'T THINK I HAVE A MEDICAL CONDITION MIGHT DRAGREES WITH ME FOR EXAMPLE I GET MIGRAINES RIGHT. SO MY DOCTOR AGREES WITH ME. SHE PROVIDES ME WITH THE ABILITY TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA. IT'S UP TO ME TO DECIDE THE DOSAGE THAT AMOUNT I USE WHEN I USE THAT HOW I USE IT. IN SO ONCE I GET THAT PRESCRIPTION UNLIKE ANY OTHER PRESCRIPTION SO IT'S NOT LIKE AN OB OR YOU'RE LIKE ALRIGHT I'M TAKING TWO OF THESE A DAY FOR TWO WEEKS. RIGHT OR WHATEVER. NOT VERY GOOD AT. MATT SO I'M GIVING THAT TO MY EMPLOYER AND NOW MY EMPLOYERS IN A POSITION WHERE HE OR SHE HAS TO. FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH THAT IS IN HOW THAT'LL AFFECT YOUR WORK PLACE SO IT'S EITHER A ZERO DRUG POLICY COMPLETELY? OR PUTTING EMPLOYERS IN A WEIRD POSITION TO FIGURE OUT HOW IMPAIRED THIS MIGHT MAKE YOU I'M JUST FEELING A LITTLE. I THINK THAT'S MY CONCERN YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A MAGIC ANSWER. AGAIN I'M A SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. THANK YOU. YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOLLOWED BY SIMILAR MELINDA'S. A SIMILAR THANK YOU I WANT TO MAYBE FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING BUT I CONCUR THIS IS NOT A BLACK AND WHITE. IT'S A LOT OF GRAY AND THERE'D BEEN A LOT OF. CHANGES IN THE WORKPLACE AND IN THE PAST AND. DECADE OR TWO SINCE WE START THINKING ABOUT A NIGHT FIRST WIDE I AGREE THAT THERE IS A DISCREPANCY. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRESCRIPTIONS OTHER OPIOID SIR ANTIDEPRESSANTS MANY THINGS THAT YOU COULD TAKE FROM A DOCTOR. IN GO TO THE WORKPLACE AND I MET PEOPLE HERE LOCALLY WHO HAVE OTHER THAT. HAD ISA PHYSICAL AILMENTS. OR ANXIETY RATHER ISSUES AND IT HAD TAKEN BEFORE LEGALIZATION MEDICAL ARE ONE AND WE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN. LEAD NORMAL LIVES AND GO TO WORK SO. I DO RECOGNIZE THAT. I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THAT SAFETY ISSUES THERE. CERTAIN PROFESSIONS YOU KNOW SOMEBODY UP BUT A CRANE YOU KNOW AND YOU WANT THAT PERSON ENTERED. TOLL BRIDGE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU THERE YOU CAN MAKE IT QUITE A FEW EXAMPLES OF CERTAIN PROFESSIONS ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE CERTAINTY THAT SOMEBODY. IS ON THEIR THEIR THEIR GAME. SO. MAY BE A YOU MISTER MISTER BONTA AREA WITNESSES SKATE CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON CALIFORNIA YOU MENTION A CALIFORNIA WERE NOT THE LEADER IN THIS THIRD TWELVE OTHER STATES AND. ANY BEST PRACTICES OR EXAMPLES OF HOW THEY'VE ADDRESSED. SOME OF THESE. POSITIONS IN THE WORKPLACE. IN. SENSITIVE JOBS. I'M SURE IT'S IT'S ONE THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THE GREAT QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING AND AND ONE THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION. FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THAT THE CONTRACTORS. ARE WHO WORK WITH WITH SOME OF THE LABOR UNIONS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO WORK IN SOME OF THE STATES WHERE. IT'S POLICY IS ALREADY IN PLACE AND SO. WE'RE GONNA HOPEFULLY HAVE A A LONGER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THERE HOW THEY'VE ADDRESSED THESE ISSUES. HOW SAFETY IS IS APPROPRIATELY ACCOMMODATED IN AND ACCOUNTED FOR? THE WITH THE WITH THE ONE THING I'LL SAY SINCE SAFETY HAS COME UP A NUMBER OF TIMES. IS THAT. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. IT NEEDS TO BE ASKED FOR BY THE EMPLOYEE. AND IT NEED NOT BE GIVEN IF IT WOULD POSE A DANGER TO THE EMPLOYEE OR OTHERS. SO THERE IS A STRONG SAFETY PROTOCOL ALREADY BUILT IN. TO EXISTING THE EXISTING FEE HOUSE STATUTE THIS PART OF THE CHANGE THAT IT CONTINUES TO FOLLOW THAT SO IF IF AN EMPLOYER. RIGHTFULLY SAYS. MISTER OR MRS EMPLOYEE YOU CAN'T BE IN THAT CRANE. TODAY IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD TO YOURSELF AND THE REST OF OUR TEAM HERE. THEY'RE FULLY WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS TO DO THAT FEE HOW SPELLS IT OUT THAT YOU CAN DO THAT. WE. ARE ALSO OFFERED AN ADDITIONAL. AMENDMENT. TO SORT OF PRIDE ADDITIONAL BELT AND SUSPENDERS ADDITIONAL STRENGTH AND REINFORCEMENT AROUND THE ISSUE OF SAFETY. AND WE CONTINUE TO TO OFFER THAT A AMENDMENT IT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO SATISFY SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THERE SOME INTEREST. AROUND I IN AND ENTIRE INDUSTRIES BEING EXEMPT WE THOUGHT WE SHOULD TIE IT TO A PRINCIPLE TO A NEXUS OF SAFETY WITHOUT THAT WAS A BETTER POLICY APPROACH. BORDER OPEN TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. I I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS TODAY ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE FOR BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE INQUIRED ABOUT AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO INQUIRE ABOUT HOPE WE HAVE MY ANSWERS FOR THE DEADLINE IN THE LITIGATION PROCESS IF. AND THE COMMITTEE IS. SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL TAKES ALLOWED TO MOVE ON AND THEN CAN YOU AYE REITERATES WHAT BUT YOU HAVE SAID. I KNOW THAT. NO THEY NOW ASSISTANT MOST CORRESPONDENTS ABOUT HERE TESTIFY FROM THE BUILDING TRADES TO. WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE BEEN MENTORED ENDS FAR AS THEIR. THEIR CONCERNS AND WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WORKING WITH WELL THEIR BALL GENERALLY HAVE A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY AND. AND IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS A PRESCRIPTION DRUG. AND DOZEN REPORTED IN A TEST POSITIVE LIKE FROM OPIOID. THAN THE EMPLOYER CAN FIRE THE EMPLOYEE SO THE DETERRENTS TO APPEARING AT WORK IS THE DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY. AND THIS BILL WOULD STILL BE IN HARMONY WITH ALL THOSE. BECAUSE IT WOULD BE THE EXACT SAME PROCESS SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A CASE FROM LAST YEAR WERE. A TRUCK DRIVER TO MINING COMPANY TOOK BIKE IT INFERS BACK AND THEN REPORTED TO THE EMPLOYER. TESTED POSITIVE AND THEN AFTER THE TEST IT WILL HAVE THIS PRESCRIPTION OF LIKE IN AN EMPLOYER TERMINATED EMPLOYEE BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO. TELL ABOUT THE EMPLOYER ABOUT THE PRESCRIPTION. AND THEY TESTED POSITIVE AND BECAUSE THEY HAD ASKED AN ACCOMMODATION AND AND IT WAS A COMBINATION IS NOT RETROACTIVE IT'S ONLY PROSPECTIVE. IS TOTALLY LEGAL SO WOULD BE THE EXACT SAME PROCESS SO ANY EMPLOYER ALL THE DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICIES. WHICH STILL EXISTS INTACT IT'S JUST THAT IF SOMEBODY HAD A PRESCRIPTION THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO ASK COULD BE ACCOMMODATED AND THEN THE EMPLOYER EITHER. EITHER AGREED TO THE ACCOMMODATION OR NOT NUCLEAR MAY SAY THAT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS FOR THIS PERSON AT THEIR DOWN DAY THEY DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESCRIPTION. OR. ON OR IT MAY BE TO GO IN THIS CASE IT CAN BE A TRANSPORTATION WORKER THAT'S EXEMPTED OR COULD BE. THE UNEMPLOYED THAT'S COVERED BY THE WAY THE THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT DRUG FREE WORKPLACE ACT UNDER THAT ACT. IN A WHICH WHICH COVERS A LOT OF EMPLOYERS A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION POURS A LOT OF PUBLIC EMPLOYERS TO GET GRANTS. AND OF THAT ACT. IF THEY KNOWINGLY HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT USE THEY'RE GONNA PROBLEMS SO. SO THAT WOULD COVER A LOT THAT OF OF THE OF EMPLOYERS AS WELL BUT THEIR VIEWS ACTION PROCESS AND IN COURTS DEAL WITH THIS ALL THE TIME. THEY JUST DEAL EMPLOYEE HAS TO TELL ANNOUNCEMENT COMPETITION AFFRONT. IF THEY DON'T TO GIVE ME A VIOLATION. SOME REMEMBER MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. NEITHER THE OPPOSITION NOR THEIR SUPPORT. THAT IT'S COME TO TESTIFY TODAY HAS CONVINCED ME. TO VOTE FOR AGAINST THEIR CAUSE. I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS COOKED YET. I THINK SOME VERY PERTINENT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED THAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO ANSWER BECAUSE YOU JUST. HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT FAR ALONG WITH THE BILL THINK THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS OR IF YOU TO GET THE SUPPORT YOU NEED. THERE'S QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ANSWERED SO MY CONCERN IS THAT HERE WE ARE VOTING ON THIS BILL TODAY. A LOT OF VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN ANSWERED. TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S POINT. YOU KNOW I AM WELL AWARE THAT IF YOU WANT A MEDICAL MARIJUANA CARD IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S IS EASY IS HANDING OVER THE CASH TO GET ONE WE KNOW THAT THAT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED IT. WHOSE LIVES ARE HELPED BY THAT THOSE WHO. END UP NOT BECOMING ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE IT'S UNFORTUNATE FOR THEM THAT THEY HAVE YOU KNOW. BAD ACTORS OUT THERE WHO ARE DOING THIS AND WE KNOW IT'S THERE AND WE'VE SEEN THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS IN THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW SO. SO WHEN YOU HAVE EMPLOYERS IN A POSITION WHERE. WHAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AT AND WHAT IS? IMPAIRED I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M WONDERING. WHO DEFINES THAT? GIVE A. YEAH. SO AGAIN I MEAN EMPLOYERS DEAL WITH US ALL THE TIME THOUGH GET AN EMPLOYEE WHO SAYS. THEY NEED TO TAKE LIKE IN AT NIGHT BECAUSE I CAN'T SLEEP. AND ALL OF THE DISCUSSION AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO ACCOMMODATE THAT PERSON AND IF THE PERSON IS IN A SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITION THAT MAY BE DRUG TESTED ARE THEY WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO. AN EMPLOYER CAN DECIDE THAT A COMBINATION OF NOT THEY HAVE A MAJOR PROFESSIONALS OR THEY DECIDE THEY ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS AND IF THEY'RE NOT CONTENT. BECAUSE IT'S AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS WITH WHAT THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES. THEN THEY'LL SAY THAT THERE'S THERE'S AND WE'RE NOT GOING THE OTHER COMMENT YOU BECAUSE. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT CLEAR ENOUGH THAT YOU HAVE AN IMPAIRMENT YOU MAY NOT BE QUALIFIED. AND SO IF THEY DO THIS ALL THE TIME WHETHER THEY HAVE A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL THAT DOES IT. AND REVIEWS THE MEDICAL RECORD OR THE NOTE FROM THE EMPLOYEE THAT SAYS THE CANTOR CAMPS TO SOMETHING OR NOT. SO THEY REALLY HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION IF THEIR EMPLOYER THAT'S UNDER THE FEE HOW OR IF HE A TO ENGAGE IN THIS PROCESS. AND SIMPLY THIS WE JUST OUTLET THE EMPLOYEE ASK IF AN EMPLOYEE HAS A BOGUS. MEDICAL AUTHORIZATION FOR CANNABIS OF THE EMPLOYER CAN ASK FOR MORE. BUT YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION ABOUT WHO DEFINES WHAT IMPAIRED MEANS. WELL. THAT'S A SEPARATE ASPECT I MEAN IMPAIR MEANS THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE BELIEVES THAT IF AN EMPLOYER BELIEVES IN EMPLOYEES IMPAIR WORK WITH THE USUALLY DO IS THEY. DAVID MAKE OBSERVATIONS AND DECIDE THAT THERE'S A REASONABLE SUSPICION AND THEN THEY ORDER A DRUG TEST. AND IF THEY ORDER DRUG TEST. AND THE EMPLOYEE IS NOT INFORM THE EMPLOYER THAT THERE HAVE SOME MEDICATION THAT HELPS THEY CAN BE FIRED. BECAUSE IF I THAT THE DRUG TESTS OF THE EMPLOYER DECIDES IMPAIRMENT BY OBSERVATION. AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO ALL THE TIME I MEAN THIS STANDARD IS YOUR OBSERVATION POST AN ACCIDENT PRE EMPLOYMENT. THEY'LL DO A TEST BUT IF THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THEY BELIEVE IN EMPLOYEE APPEARS IMPAIRED AT WORK. THEN THEY'LL DO IT OBSERVATION BILL THAT MAYBE HAVE TO AND THEY DECIDE WHETHER THE PERSON IS ACTING BIZARRE. LOOKING DIFFERENT AND THEY CAN ORDER PERSON TAKE A DRUG TEST. WHEN THE EMPLOYEE SHOWS UP WITH THAT WITH THE CERTIFICATION AND SAYS. I'D LIKE AN ACCOMMODATION. YOU KNOW THE EMPLOYER OUGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER THE ACCOMMODATION. WHAT HAVE THE PERSON PARA WORKER NOT THERE'S PLENTY OF JOBS WERE YOU KNOW? IN A VACANT TAKEN THAT IT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE OTHER PLANES ALSO WILL AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A TRUCK DRIVER WHO'S. WHOSE. ON BIKE IN OR BENZODIAZEPINES THAN THEY WANT OTHER TRUCK DRIVER THE CAN A COMIC THAT TRUCK DRIVER SAFETY PERFORMANCE FUNCTIONS. CAN I ASK MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT PROBLEM SOMEONE FROM THE OPPOSITION COME FORWARD TO ADDRESS MY CONCERNS IS A LOT LIKE TO HEAR BOTH SIDES OF THIS. I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS JUST. WE YOU WE NO ONE WANTS TO COME UP SOMEONE. MAYBE. MONEY TO COME SIT AT THE TABLE. THEY DON'T BITE. NAY NO. SO. MY QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY RIGHT NOW IS THE INA WHO DECIDES WHAT IMPAIRED IT'S EIGHT HE'S SUGGESTING THAT YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU'RE TELLING. YOUR EMPLOYER THAT YOU'RE TAKING THIS TYPE OF MEDICATION WHETHER IT'S MARIJUANA OR SOME TYPE OF OPIOID. IF YOU TELL THEM AHEAD OF TIME THAT'S ONE THING IF YOU DON'T TELL THEM AND THEN THERE'S SOME SORT OF ACCIDENT HEARD HEARD SOMETHING THAT GOES ON IT WORKING HAVEN'T TOLD THEM THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT I JUST I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DOES IMPAIRED MEAN WHO DECIDES THAT AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE THAT YOU'RE DRIVING A TRUCK OR OPERATING A CRANE. I MEAN THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER AREAS OF EMPLOYMENT WHERE THE EMPLOYER. WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO BE IMPAIRED WHATEVER THAT MEANS SO CAN YOU ANSWER OUT OF THE SECOND SO. MARTY FISHER COACHING. SO FIRST OF ALL I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY. PACIFIC JOBS WHERE AN EMPLOYER WOULD. WANT OR WOULD ALLOW AN EMPLOYEE BE IMPAIRED ON THE JOB I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T I WOULD HEARD FROM ANY OF MY MEMBERS ARE MY COLLEAGUES WHERE THEY SAY WELL THIS PARTICULAR JOB IT WOULD BE OKAY. AND AS FAR AS DETERMINING IMPAIRMENT. THERE IS NO DEFINITIVE METHOD TO DO SO OTHER THAN THE ONLY ONE THAT THAT I'VE THAT I'VE FOUND. IS THE. CH P. THEY HAVE A DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT AND IT IS A MAJOR TRAINING AND THEN THEY SIT AND OBSERVE THE INDIVIDUAL FOR TWO HOURS. TAKE THE BLOOD PRESSURE BUT AS FAR AS A. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE OF BREATHALYZER FOR ALCOHOL. IMPAIRMENT YOU HAVE YOU KNOW URINALYSIS AND. OTHER TESTS FOR TO. DETERMINE OTHER OTHER TYPES OF. DRUGS IN THE IN THE SYSTEM OR OR IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS ALSO DIFFICULT AND A LOT OF SITUATIONS BUT FOR FOR MARIJUANA IMPAIRMENT THERE THERE'S THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THERE SOME. TESTS THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT. SO IT'S JUST. IT'S IT CAN BE A JUDGMENT CALL AND IF WERE. WE HELLA EXPOSURE TOLITIGATION BECAUSE WE. SUSPECT THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS IMPAIRED BUT WE CAN'T PROVE IT SO. IF WE HAVE A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE POLICY NOW WE WILL USES ZERO TOLERANCE. LEVEL SO BUT UNDER. A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION IF WE HAVE KNOWINGLY HIRED THE PERSON. WITH A POSITIVE DRUG TEST FOR TTC AND WE'VE ALLOWED WE'VE HIRED THEM KNOWING THAT WE GIVE THEM ACCOMMODATION IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE ACCOMMODATION IS BUT THEN. WE DO A DRUG TEST TO TEST THEM FOR IMPAIRMENT WE WE DON'T HAVE ONE BECAUSE IF THEY'VE ALREADY TOLD US THAT THEY'RE. USING MARIJUANA THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO USE IN THEIR SYSTEM AND WE BASICALLY SAID THAT'S OKAY WHEN WE HIRED THEM. AS IN THE ISLAM THING AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. OPEN THOSE THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO HOW HOW THE TEST IS DONE AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A STRAIGHT ANSWER AS TO HOW HOW IF IMPAIRMENT CAN MAKE. YOU CAN FIND IMPAIRMENT YOU CAN FIND OPIOIDS IN THE SYSTEM AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A RANGE OF LEVELS. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ONE THAT'S AGREED UPON THAT IS IMPAIRMENT OR NOT SO THERE'S NO STANDARD IN PLACE FOR. OPIOIDS EITHER THAT. I MEAN I'M I'M JUST TRYING THERE THERE ARE. I HAVE NOT I CAN TELL YOU I'M I'M NOT CERTAIN I JUST READ IT DEPENDS ON. YOUR YOUR. YOUR BODY WEIGHT YOUR AGE YOUR METABOLISM ALL MEDICINES AFFECT YOU DIFFERENTLY THAT'S WHY THERE'S RECOMMENDED DOSAGE DON'T YOU EVEN JUMP IN THERE I SEE LEANING FORWARD. AND I WAS. THERE IS THAT THAT RIGHT THERE IS A DIFFERENT DOSAGE SO I WOULD IMAGINE THE SAME IS TRUE FOR OPIOIDS. OR FOR MARIJUANA OR ANYTHING ELSE AND. YOU KNOW YOU OKAY SO YOU GET A PERSCRIPTION THAT IN YOUR DOCTOR SAYS TAKE ONE BIKE AND IN THE MORNING AND YOU DECIDE WELL I'M REALLY A LOT OF PAIN SO MANY TAKE TO. WHILE. HOW HOW IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED IN? KNOW THAT IT I MEAN IT'S JUST THIS IS REALLY COMPLICATED AND. THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I CAN'T. I'M JUST NOT THERE TODAY BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT ALL THE KINKS. AND I THINK MY QUESTION IS TO BOTH OF YOU HAVE MADE THAT PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ANSWERS. SAU I WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE ARE NO ANSWERS AND IT IS VERY COMPLICATED. I MEAN FOR THE PEOPLE LIKE I SAID AND I WILL WRAP BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING. BUT FOR. WE YOU KNOW LIKE YOUR YOUR GENTLEMAN WHO CAME WHO IS THE VETERAN WHO TALKED ABOUT. HIS HIS USE OF MEDICAL MARIJUANA AND FOR THE MANY OTHER VETERANS OUT THERE WHO ALSO NEEDED OR ANYONE FRANKLY WHO'S NOT EVEN A VETERAN PEOPLE OF LEGITIMATE. USES FOR THIS TYPE OF. TREATMENT. AND DON'T WANT TO GO ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. I THINK. WHEN WE END UP PUTTING POLICIES IN THE PLACE WHERE WE ALMOST. DRIVE THEM RIGHT TO IT. AND NOW WE HAVE THIS OPIOID CRISIS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL NOT JUST A STATE LEVEL. SO THERE'S THIS TENDENCY TO THINK THAT IF A DOCTOR GIVES IT TO YOU IT'S OKAY IT'S GOOD. IF YOU DON'T GET IT FROM A DOCTOR THAT IT'S THAT IT'S BAD OR ITS I JUST. GOOD LUCK. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. WELL THERE YOU HAVE IT GOOD LUCK. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER. NOT THAT I WANTED. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA FOR BRINGING THIS FOR. UNITE BOTH KNOW AS THE. SOUNDING FIVE OF THE LAWS FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA. REASON WE EVEN GOT INVOLVED IN IT IS BECAUSE. THIS IS A OF CALIFORNIA VOTED FOR MEDICAL MARIJUANA WE CAN COME OVER REGULATIONS FOR NINE OR TEN YEARS. AND IT TOOK THE EFFORTS OF FIVE OF US TO CONDUCT COALESCING BRINGING TOGETHER A LOT OF IT BECAUSE OF FEAR. FEAR OF NEW THINGS FAIRLY UNKNOWN. AND THERE WERE SEVERAL SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. TO PROMOTE REGULATIONS FOR THAT AND WITH THE EFFORTS OF BIPARTISAN EFFORT. OF A LOT OF PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER TO PUT THE ORIGINAL MEDICAL MARIJUANA LAWS ENTER INTO A FACT. AND I KNOW WE DID IT. BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GOT ACCESS. TO REMEDIES THAT WE KNEW WOULD HELP. I WAS VETERANS WHAT IS GOOD YOUNG PEOPLE WITHOUT CHRONIC ILLNESSES SENIOR IF. WE KNEW THAT THE MEDICINAL ELEMENTS OF OF CANNABIS ARM. WERE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE ALSO KNEW THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T DOING IT. OR THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEEDED IT. IT WENT ABOUT GETTING HOT. AND AND SO I ALSO WANT TO SAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT BOTH SAFETY. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THE GOVERNOR MESSAGES ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY IN THE WORKPLACE. REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T MISS THAT EITHER. SAFETY IS REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH EMPLOYEES. AND I AND I GUESS IN. PLOY YEARS BUT WILL PROBABLY EMPLOYEES DIPPING A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE BETWEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU. HONESTLY WHAT I'M ON. BUT BECAUSE WE KIND OF HAD THIS REEFER MADNESS KIND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CANNABIS IS. WE AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY THAT IT'S ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA AUTOMATICALLY GETS HIGH. AND IS TEACH SEA LEVELS BETTER CAN BE REALLY IN. NONE. TO VERY VERY LOW. AM WE NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT EVERYBODY THAT'S ON MEDICAL MARIJUANA. CAN'T WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME. YOU NO AND AND I GOT TO HEAR THIS STUFF ABOUT IT DRIVE. NOTEBOOK UP. DRIVE TO DRUG OR PATHWAY DRIVE YOU MIGHT IT MAYBE ALL OF THAT BUT IT MAY NOT BE ALL THAT I KNOW ONE THING YOU MAY NOT. BE. A DRUG TO ANOTHER DRUG BUT IT. IT DEFINITELY HAS HAD SOME GREAT EFFECT ON AND HELPING PEOPLE AND I WISH A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE WOULD. USE A MODEM MEDICINAL STUFF THAT'S OUT THERE THE MIGHT EVEN CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT SOME THE ELEMENT YOU HAVE AND WHETHER NOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY OPERATE. AND DO THINGS I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM RIGHT HERE THAT THAT INDIVIDUALS. BANKS ARE. WELL. I HAVEN'T SMOKED SINCE SEVENTY NINE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME STUFF OUT THERE. THAT. BUT SO. STRONG COMPARED TO WHAT WAS GOING ON IN SEVENTIES. THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYBODY GOING TO WORK. IT IS SO STRONG BILL PASSED OUT. AND SO JUSTICE IT WILL NEVER HONEST DISCUSSION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RECTORY TIONAL USE OR ADULT USE. AND MEDICAL BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TUMBLE MEDICAL HERE AND HOPEFULLY STAY ON MEDICAL. BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS DISCUSSION. SEEM TO BE. DEVOLVED INTO RECREATIONAL AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT WE DO WE REALLY NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY. AND SAFETY SAFETY IS MOST IMPORTANT AND THE. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAS A VALID. A VALID REASON. TO BRING THIS UP I'M WORKING WITH CHP ALONG WITH MISTER BONTA. DAY HAVE FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS A CANNABIS. THAT THEY WORKING ON INTO PERFECTING FOOT WITH FUNDING THAT CAME FROM US. EARLY ON WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND. BRING THAT OUT TO THE FOREFRONT SO THAT EMPLOYERS CAN ACTUALLY USE SOME OF THOSE. THOSE TESTS FOR THE CONTEST BEFORE IF SOMEONE TELLS YOU TO USE IN IT YOU CAN DO THOSE TYPE OF TEST DETERMINE WHETHER THAT THEY CAN OPERATE. ON DANGERS MACHINERY BECAUSE WE DO NOT I REPEAT WE DO NOT WANT THEM OPERATING ANY TYPE OF LOVE. MACHINERY. AGAIN THIS IS NOT NINETEEN EIGHTEEN. IS NOT DIG NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN. LET'S COME INTO THE FUTURE AND MOVE FORWARD AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW. THAT THE AMENDMENT YOU'RE TAKING A THAT THINGS THAT YOU'RE WORKING THROUGH. IS IS NOT THAT IT'S HALF COOKED IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE I GET FULLY BAKED BEFORE WE GET IT OUT OF HERE. AND THEN. YOU WILL HAVE IT DONE O'DONNELL DEBATE YOU KNOW. PINE INTENDED EFFECT. I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS AN ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT ORGANIC. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY THANK YOU. WE ARE MOST WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND PERSON I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US SUCH AN INTERESTING BILL. AYE AYE. I THINK YOU I THINK YOU WITNESS THAT FOR MANY OF US THAT CREATES A KIND A HEALTHY DISCOMFORT. YOU KNOW I'LL SAY FOR MYSELF THE IDEA OF SAFETY WAS PARAMOUNT MY MIND IN SO MY FIRST REACTION GUT REACTION WAS HOW CAN THIS BE. AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE CONCERNS WE HEARD FROM OUR EMPLOYERS TODAY. I. I HAD THE BALANCE AND TEMPER THAT AGAINST THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE MIGHT NEED. AN ACCOMMODATION AND THAT ARE OUR SYSTEMS HAVE ALLOWED FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE NEED FOR AN ACCOMMODATION TO HAVE IT. AND IT IT IS THAT THAT ALLOWS ME TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER I THINK WE HAVE TO ANSWER HOW. WE BALANCE THE NEEDS OF ACCOMMODATION WITH SAFETY OF FOR THOSE IN OUR WORKPLACES IN THIS IS CLEARLY NEW TERRITORY. AND AND SO I HOPE THAT AS YOU GO FOR WITH THE BILL YOU WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR EMPLOYERS. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW TO KEEP OUR WORKPLACE A SAFE REGARDLESS OF THE TYPES OF POSITIONS IT JUST SEEMS THAT THERE COULD BE THERE COULD BE CHALLENGES BUT BUT THAT. WE DON'T DOT CHALLENGES WE LOOK FOR WAYS TO ANSWER THEM AND FIND WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD IN WAYS THAT ARE THOUGHTFUL AND SO. THIS BILL HAS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL ALSO ADDRESSED THE CONCERNS WE HEARD FROM PLAYERS TODAY ABOUT LIABILITY. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE LAW SAYS ONE THING AROUND ACCOMMODATIONS. WE KNOW THAT OUR EMPLOYERS COULD ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE AROUND LIABILITY. AND SO WE WOULD ASK THAT. YOU MAKE THAT A KEY FOCUS OF YOUR WORK WON'T FOR WITH EMPLOYERS IN OUR STAKEHOLDERS I HAVE DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. WOULD LIKE CLOSER TO THE COUPLE GOOD QUICK COMMENTS FIRST. I LOOK FOURTEEN ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION THERE'S THERE'S THINGS THAT I'M OPEN MINDED TOOK TO LEARN ABOUT TO ADDRESS TO IMPROVE ON. AT TO THINK ABOUT I THINKS AND SOME OF THE THINGS WHAT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT TOGETHER DID IT'S IT'S SOME SOMEWHAT OF OF NEW TERRITORY. SO THE FOR TO. A CLEVER PROCESS TO IS TO EXPLORE AND STRENGTH IN THIS BILL I THINK A LOT OF THAT CONCERNS I'VE HEARD TODAY. ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT MEDICAL CANNABIS THERE ABOUT THE EXISTING FEE HOUSE SYSTEM AND REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT'S BEEN THE LAW FOR MULTIPLE DECADES AND HOW IT APPLIES TO TO ALL. PRESCRIBE MEDICINES ALL WORK AND AND AND. YOU KNOW I THINK BECAUSE WE WATCH THINGS LIKE CSI AND OTHER THINGS WE EXPECT THE LEVEL OF EXACTITUDE WHERE YOU KNOW. WITH THE LEVEL OF PRECISION AND AND AND CERTAINTY THAT SOMETHING IT ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OR NOT BUT. EMPLOYERS ACROSS THIS STATE HAVE FOR FOR MANY MANY YEARS NOW. DEALT WITH JUDGMENT CALLS AND A MULTIPLE INDICIA AND FACTORS THAT LEAD TOWARD THE DECISION ABOUT IMPAIRMENT. AND DECISION ABOUT WHAT ACCOMPLISHES. WHAT WHAT CONSTITUTES REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AND THAT WHAT THAT WILL CONTINUE? WITH WITH WITH ANOTHER MEDIC MEDICINE A MEDICINE FRANKLY THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECIDED. OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO WAS SOMETHING THAT. THE CALIFORNIA PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO AND THESE ARE PATIENTS WHO ARE BATTLING EPILEPSY WHO ARE BATTLING CANCER FOR SOME FOR WHOM THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE. HAVEN'T TO TO GET RID OF THAT PAIN. THAT THAT MAKES OUR LIFE IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE SO. I THINK THOSE PATIENTS DESERVE NOT TO BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE WORKPLACE I THINK THAT. THAT. BILLS SHOULD NOT BE HELD TO THE STANDARD IN THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE THAT THE READY FOR SIGNATURE THAT DAY THE WHOLE REASON WE GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS TO GET THE INPUT OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. AND DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO MAKE THE BILL STRONGER TODAY HAS BEEN EXACTLY THAT IT'S WHAT IT'S WHAT MADE THIS BILL STRONGER BY RAISING ISSUES THAT I WILL WORK ON PURPOSE PROVIDES. SOLUTIONS AND SO I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN MORE AND AND GET INPUT AS WE GO FORWARD I'M. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND HOPE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENTS THAT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN THE WORKS IN THE WORKPLACE THANK YOU.
