GET STARTED AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TIME WAKEFIELD NAY THAT ARE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A BILL. AND YES HERE AND WE TALK ABOUT SP. FOUR EIGHT FIVE CORRECT. HAVING REPRESENTED FOR MANY YEARS HE ONLY VETERANS HOME IN CALIFORNIA THAT YOU DON'T BILL AND NOW TO MY DELIGHT THEY'RE ALL OVER CALIFORNIA SERVING OUR VETERANS. I KNOW HOW SENSITIVE THE VETERANS ARE. TO THE PROCEDURES. THE GOVERNOR HOMES. INCLUDING THE VETERANS COUNCILS AT WHICH I WORKED ON MANY MANY YEARS AGO [inaudible] THEY NOW WITH THAT THE MULTIPLE. VETERANS HOMES THERE'S A NEED I BELIEVE FOR HAVING SOME MORE CONSISTENCY. THROUGHOUT THE HOMES IN TERMS OF THEIR REGULATIONS. THESE PROCEDURES ARE ADAPTED THAT ADOPTED BY REGULATION THAT ACCORDING TO THE ACA MINISTRATIONS TEACHERS ACT. AND THERE IS FOR PUBLIC INPUT ALLOWED. BUT THE CHANGES THE THE REGULATIONS. I HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND THAT WAS THE YEAR WHEN THERE WAS ONLY. YEAH BILL AND NOW WITH THE MANY HOMES. I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO TRY TO THE BEST WE CAN MORE STANDARDIZED. SO THAT THE HEHE OF THE AND THE ADMINISTRATORS THOUGH ARE THE RESPONSIBLE BUT WE HOLD THEM IN TERMS OF THIS BILL A BIT MORE ACCOUNTABLE -- FOR THE STANDARDIZATION. OF THEIR REGULATIONS AT EACH INSTITUTION. AND I THINK THEN THAT -- AGAIN AS A PRODUCT OF JUST HAVING MANY HOMES -- IT'S NOT TO BEING ACCUSATORY MANY GIVEN HOME WITH ANY OF THE ADMINISTRATORS NOT GOING TO BE DOING THE JOB. BUT I THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME. IS TO ALLOW THE VETERANS TO HAVE THE PEACE AND COMFORT THAT EVERYTHING. IS THE SAME. AND THEY ARE SECURE. BUT ALSO WE GET IT WOULD IT WOULD IMPLEMENTED NOT TONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM. THAT IS IT FOR THE ALL OF THESE INSTITUTIONS AS WELL -- THAT IS THE FUTURE THAT'S ALREADY UPON US AND HEALTH CARE. AND THE ADOPTION OF HEALTH CARE. RIDERS WITH. INTEREST AND ACCESS TO THESE THE THIS TECHNOLOGY IF YOU WILL -- AND LEAVE A NEW. A DIP VANCE'S AND HEALTH CARE VIA [inaudible] TELECONFERENCE CONCETTA. I THINK THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT FIND FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE IS TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY. IN THE REGULATIONS. AMONG THE VARIOUS [inaudible] HOMES.

FREDERICK CAMARO WITH THE AMERICAN GI FORUM CALIFORNIA STRONGLY SUPPORTS [inaudible] THIRTEEN FOURTEEN SENATE. ALRIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. SENATOR I'VE TO HOUSEKEEPING QUESTIONS IS SO I CAN KEEP THIS STRAIGHT IN MY MIND -- AGREE A 100% I SUPPORT THIS I WILL VOTE FOR IT. WHAT PERCENT OF BEDS FAR? MORE EXTREME MENTAL HEALTH ON ISSUES ARE YOU THINKING OF HERE. YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT -- WAY JUST LOOKING AT ASKING CAO VETS TO GO AHEAD AND AND GIVE US AN ANALYSIS I'M YOU'VE GOT ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND VETERANS IN THESE GROUP IN THESE HOMES. AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW TO DISCHARGE AND WENT TO THIS CHARGE AND WHERE IT'S CAN THEY GO WHERE SHOULD THEY GO. SHOULD THEY GET MORE. ASSISTANT OR NOT. AND SO WE'VE WE RAN THE SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR. ALL I AM AND IT DIDN'T GO FURTHER UNFORTUNATELY AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET CALVET TO SAY HEY. THAT'S FIGURE SOMETHING OUT NOW AND NOT. TOMORROW OR THREE YEARS FROM NOW OR WHENEVER THEY DECIDE. TO OKAY BECAUSE THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING OF A MASSIVE STUDY RIGHT NOW. AND IF THEY ARE HEAVILY ARMED EVEN IT'S COMING OUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN NEXT SESSION. TWENTY TWENTY EARLY -- THE AND THAT LEADS DIRECTLY INTO MY LAST QUESTION -- IN MY SYNOPSIS IS SAYS REQUIRES CALVET TO BEGIN ADOPTING THE PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS BY JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY IN THE BIG PICTURE THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH THE SCHEDULING OF ADOPTING ANY CHANGES OR UPGRADES OR DOWNGRADES. TO THE VETERANS HOMES AND THE WHOLE CALVET SYSTEM. SO MY MY ONE CONCERN WHERE THERE WAS IF WE PUT A JULY FIRST HARD DATE. ONE CALVET THAT MIGHT INTERFERE WITH QUITE A FEW OF THEIR OTHER OPERATIONS AND THEY ALSO NEED TO REPORT. TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH THEIR WHOLE COMPLETE. PLAN OF OF UPGRADE AND CHANGE FOR THE CALVERT SYSTEM. SO THAT WAS MY CONCERN IS IF YOU HAVE. ONE HARD AND FAST DATE BUT YET THE OTHER DATES ARE RELATIVELY OPEN -- THAT WOULD BE CONFUSING THE CALVERT. SO A ASSEMBLYMAN -- Y. THE MASTER PLAN AND OUR BILL S. B. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OUR FOCUS ON THE SAME GOAL OF SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS HOME. THE MASTER PLAN ONLY REQUIRES CALVET TO DISCUSS ANALYZE AND RECOMMEND CHANGES. OF THAT THE LA ó REPORT PUBLISHED IN JANUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HAS DONE THAT. WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGE. S. B. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN GOES FURTHER BY REQUIRING CAO THAT TO TAKE UP THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE LA A REPORT AND IMPLEMENTED BY. TWENTY TWENTY SO YOU KNOW THE MASTER PLAN WHY WE APPRECIATE WANTED TO GO FORWARD. IT'S ONLY TELLING CAO BUT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ANALYZE IT AND MAKE RECOMMENDATION BUT THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW TIME FRAME THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR OUR STATE WHERE SAY OUR BILL IS LIKE. WE HAVE A LA A REPORT IT'S PUBLISHED IT THERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS THERE LET'S DO IT NOW AND NOT WAIT ANY FURTHER. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. OKAY A SAW I'M NOT GONNA BE ISSUING A RECOMMENDATION EITHER WAY ON YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK OUR STAFFS -- SPOKE ON THAT -- I KNOW THAT IT'S AN IDEA THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A LONG TIME AND CERTAINLY IT'S A GOOD ONE THAT BETWEEN YOUR ORIGINAL BILLS INTRODUCTION AND TODAY'S HEARING THE LEGISLATURE HAS DIRECTED CALVET. TO COMPLETE A MASTER PLAN THAT WOULD ADDRESS EXACTLY THE SUBSTANCE OF YOUR BILL AND SO -- THIS IS THE IN MY MIND BASED. I'M I'M JUST NOT GOING TO BE VOTING ON YOUR BILL TODAY -- BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE ANY POLICIES THAT DIFFERENCES WITH YOU SO -- FACT THAT SECRETARY PLEASE TO THE ROLL CALL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS -- AND AND IT WAS I'M SORRY MOTION WAS BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER IN THE SECOND BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. IRWIN NOT VOTING. VOEPEL. VOEPEL I CHáVEZ.
