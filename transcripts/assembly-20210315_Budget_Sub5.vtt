FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE

THESE FUNDS TO THE GENERAL FUND

00:27:50.702 --> 00:27:52.303
THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE STRATEGY

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.538
FOR ADDRESSING THE ONGOING

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:55.240
PROBLEM. HOWEVER WE THINK IT'S

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.574
IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER OTHER

00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:58.610
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS INCLUDING

00:27:58.676 --> 00:27:59.677

SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE

00:28:01.112 --> 00:28:02.514
GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT. IN OR

JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO DO SO. AT

00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.852
THE END THE IMMINENT SOLVENCY

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.087
OF THESE FUNDS IS ONE

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:10.055
MANIFESTATION OF A BROADER

00:28:10.121 --> 00:28:11.556
PROBLEM RELATED TO DECLINING

FINING FEE REVENUES IN RECENT

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:14.292
YEARS. WHICH IS NEGATIVELY

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.994
IMPACTED A VARIETY OF RECIP

00:28:16.061 --> 00:28:18.430
RECIPIENT FUNDS. ONE OF WHICH

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:19.130
WOULD BE THE TRIAL COURT TRUST

00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:22.167
FUND. THEREFORE ANY SOLUTION.

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:23.535
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.170
BROADER CONTEXT OF ADDRESSING

00:28:25.236 --> 00:28:27.238
IT FOR THE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS.

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:28.606
FOR NOW- FUND CONSOLIDATION

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:30.108
ALLOWS FOR THE FUND TO REMAIN

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:31.509
SOLVENT WITHOUT REDUCING

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:33.511
SERVICE LEVELS IN REQUIRING A

00:28:33.578 --> 00:28:34.913
GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION IN

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:35.914
THE BUDGET YEAR WHILE WE

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.449
DEVELOP A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:38.883
ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY. IN

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.655
THESE FUNDS AND OTHERS. THANK

QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND ARE

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.226
BIGGER FOR THE PANEL. WHAT THE

00:28:48.293 --> 00:28:50.395
LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.930
SO FOR THE CONSTRUCTION

00:28:51.996 --> 00:28:53.398
PROPOSALS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE

00:28:53.465 --> 00:28:55.433
YOU WE DO HAVE SEVERAL

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.902
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AT MINIMUM

00:28:57.969 --> 00:28:58.970
WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:00.672
LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

00:29:00.738 --> 00:29:01.406
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.508
CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE IT DOES

00:29:03.575 --> 00:29:04.943
DELAY THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:06.878
INSOLVENCY AND THE BUDGET HERE

00:29:06.945 --> 00:29:07.912
AND THERE REALLY IS NO

00:29:07.979 --> 00:29:09.747
RATIONALE FOR MAINTAINING TWO

00:29:09.814 --> 00:29:10.915
SEPARATE ACCOUNTS ONE BOTH OF

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:12.050
THEM ARE GOING TO BECOME

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:14.419
INSOLVENT. ANYWAYS I'M HOWEVER

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:15.920
AS A REFERENCE BY THE

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:17.322
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.023
ISN'T REALLY A PLAN TO ADDRESS

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.658
THAT'S INSOLVENCY PERMANENTLY

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:22.627
SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:23.561
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE GO

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.630
FURTHER BY ELIMINATING THE

00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:26.998
ACCOUNTS AND SHIFTING FULL

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:29.033
RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIAL COURT

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:29.767
CONSTRUCTION OVER TO THE

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:31.669
GENERAL FUND- AND THIS IS

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:34.405
BECAUSE ABSENT ANY CHANGES.

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:35.607
SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND

00:29:35.673 --> 00:29:37.175
RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:39.144
NEEDED TO SUPPORT EXISTING

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.378
OBLIGATIONS WHICH IS MOST

00:29:40.445 --> 00:29:42.080
NOTABLY THAT SERVICE FOR

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:43.515
COURTHOUSES THAT WE'VE ALREADY

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.383
COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION FOR AND

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.918
SO WE ESTIMATE THAT AROUND A

00:29:46.985 --> 00:29:47.919
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:48.853
MILLION COULD BE NEEDED

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.855
BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:29:50.922 --> 00:29:51.723
THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.858
WHAT DECLINE OVER TIME AS

00:29:53.925 --> 00:29:55.260
PROJECTS WERE PAID OFF BUT WE

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:56.895
LIKELY NEED GENERAL FUND

00:29:56.961 --> 00:29:58.296
RESOURCES FOR THE NEXT SIXTEEN

00:29:58.363 --> 00:30:00.565
YEARS AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:02.100
TO SHIFT THESE OBLIGATIONS OVER

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:03.535
WOULD PERMANENTLY ADDRESS THE

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:05.737
INSOLVENCY AND ENSURE THAT ANY

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.272
GENERAL FUND CONSTRUCTED

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:08.072
CONSTRUCTION RELATED

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.975
OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.277
FOR WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:13.711
CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FISCAL

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:18.049
CONDITION AND FIGURING OUT.

00:30:18.116 --> 00:30:19.083
WHICH ARE OFTEN PRIORITIES. I

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.784
IN ONE WITH THE ELIMINATE OF

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.419
THE TWO. ACCOUNTS WE ARE ALSO-

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:23.555
RECOMMENDING SHIFTING OVER ALL

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.156
NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED

00:30:25.223 --> 00:30:27.425
EXPENSES SUCH AS THE AMOUNT-

00:30:27.492 --> 00:30:28.092
PROVIDED FOR TRIAL COURT

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:29.861
OPERATIONS AND HAVING AN

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.930
APPROPRIATION TO JUST MAINTAIN

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.398
THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. WE'RE

00:30:33.464 --> 00:30:34.866
ALSO RECOMMENDING DEPOSITING

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:36.434
ALL OF THE REVENUE THAT WOULD

00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.368
NORMALLY GO INTO THE

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:38.403
CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS INTO THE

00:30:38.469 --> 00:30:40.205
GENERAL FUND INSTEAD SO THAT

00:30:40.271 --> 00:30:41.573
THEY ARE STILL AVAILABE TO

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:44.309
OFFSET ALL OF THOSE EXPENDITURE

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:44.909
OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE SHIFTED

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:47.512
OVER. MOVING FORWARD WE

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:48.580
RECOMMEND APPROVING THE

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:50.248
GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO FIND ANY

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:51.382
NEW TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION

00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:53.151
PROJECTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

00:30:53.218 --> 00:30:54.285
THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE

00:30:54.352 --> 00:30:55.887
LEGISLATURE IS FULLY AWARE OF

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:57.488
THE TOTAL COSTS FOR ANY NEW

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.123
PROPOSED PROJECTS THE IMPACTS

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.091
THAT THE HAVE ON THE GENERAL

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.894
FUND. AND HOW LEGISLATURE GOING

00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:03.461
TO WEIGH THEM AGAINST OTHER

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:05.697
PRIORITIES. HOWEVER WE DO

00:31:05.763 --> 00:31:07.465
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.033
DETERMINE WHICH SPECIFIC

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.602
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO FUND

00:31:10.668 --> 00:31:12.570
BASED ON ITS PRIORITIES WHICH

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.038
MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE ANY OF

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:15.073
THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.975

00:31:18.176 --> 00:31:20.678
BUDGET YEAR OR THE ADDITIONAL

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:21.579
TWELVE PROJECTS THAT ARE SLATED

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.348
TO COME ON BOARD IN THE NEXT

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:26.484
FOUR YEARS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

ACTUALLY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:39.731
THE FIRST ONE IS FOR THE

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:42.000
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND IF THEY

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:43.534

IN TWENTY TWENTY CUTS TO THE

REGARDLESS OF WHICH COUNTY THEY

00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:05.570
ARE IN IN IN THE PROPOSAL IS ON

00:35:05.636 --> 00:35:07.638
A TIERED APPROACH I STARTED

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.707
WITH TWELVE STARTING WITH JUST

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:10.741
OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:12.009
THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN IT'S

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.177
ON A PHASED IN APPROACH WITH

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.047
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SET ASIDE

00:35:16.113 --> 00:35:17.615
IN THE ONGOING YEARS TO ROLL

00:35:17.682 --> 00:35:19.217
OUT TO MORE COURTS ON A YEAR BY

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:22.420
YEAR BASIS- AND THEN FOR THE

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:25.189
SECOND HIGHWAY I WAS- TRYING TO

00:35:25.256 --> 00:35:28.459
GET WHICH ONE YEAR THAT'S WHAT

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:29.961
YOUR DRESSING WITHOUT. I DON'T

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:33.097
REMEMBER. WHAT IS IT SELF HELP

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:38.002
SELF HELP. OKAY TO SELF HELP

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.438
WAS A NEW ISSUE INCLUDING THE

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:42.340
TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AS A

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:44.308
LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND THAT

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:46.577
IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END THE

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.146
CURRENT YEAR THE PROPOSAL IN

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.882
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:53.384
EXTEND THIS FUNDING ON GOING IN

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.519
THIS FUNDING GOES TO SUPPORT

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:55.753
OVER MILLION INDIVIDUALS EACH

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.022
YEAR WITH THROUGH CRITICAL SELF

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.290
HELP ISSUES WHICH HAVE ONLY

00:35:59.357 --> 00:36:00.691
BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE

00:36:00.758 --> 00:36:02.560
ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. SO WE'RE

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:03.494
REALLY WE'RE SEEKING TO

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:04.962
CONTINUE THE NINETEEN POINT ONE

00:36:05.029 --> 00:36:09.267
MILLION DOLLARS- EACH YEAR IN

00:36:09.333 --> 00:36:12.603
AN ONGOING BASIS. OKAY THANK

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.307
YOU MR STONE. THANK YOU OF IT I

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:18.209
THINK JUST SOME GENERAL

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:19.043
COMMENTS AS OPPOSED TO

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.045
QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:22.246
WE'RE TOUCHING ON A LOT OF

00:36:22.313 --> 00:36:24.815
THINGS WITH THIS ISSUE AND THEN

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.918
THE THREE PANELS THAT ARE

00:36:26.984 --> 00:36:27.752
COMING UP WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO

00:36:27.818 --> 00:36:29.921
AS WELL. AND WHAT THE PANDEMIC

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:34.592
HAS REALLY SHOWN IS THAT. WE

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:36.861
DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:39.597
ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ALL FIFTY

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:41.666
EIGHT COURTS AS I THINK WE

00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:44.669
SHOULD STRIVE FOR. AARON WE'VE

00:36:44.735 --> 00:36:47.605
BUILT OVER THE YEARS A BUDGET

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:49.640
FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THAT

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.109
THE COURT SYSTEM. THAT IT HAS

00:36:52.176 --> 00:36:54.645
BEEN BASED ON KIND OF BUILDING

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:56.380
UP FINES AND FEES AND MAY

00:36:56.447 --> 00:36:58.716
HAVING MADE OTHER DECISIONS

00:36:58.783 --> 00:37:03.054
THAT. THAT SHOW TO BE FAIRLY

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.822
SUSPECT NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.958
TO SORT THROUGH HOW TO LOOK

00:37:07.024 --> 00:37:08.459
INTO THE FUTURE AND I LOOK AT

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:10.227
SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. AND

00:37:10.294 --> 00:37:12.363
YES WE NEED SELF HELP. AND I

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.732
COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THE WORK

00:37:14.799 --> 00:37:16.534
AROUND THE ABILITY TO PAY AS

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:18.302
WELL AS THE RELIANCE ON FINES

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.605
AND FEES. REALLY SHOW THE THAT

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:23.874
WE'VE BUILT. REVENUES FOR THE

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:25.910
JUDICIAL BRANCH CUTTING IN THE

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:28.679
WRONG WAY IT'S ALSO HARD FOR ME

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.381
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:34.552
THE- REMOTE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:37.154
PIECE OF THE TRAILER BILL HERE

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:39.390
WITHOUT. ALL OF US HAVING A

00:37:39.457 --> 00:37:40.625
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:43.294
IMPACT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:46.430
HAD ON OUR COURTS D. TO

00:37:46.497 --> 00:37:48.232
JUDICIARY COMMITTEES ASSEMBLY

00:37:48.299 --> 00:37:49.433
AND SENATE HELD A HEARING NOT

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.503
LONG AGO. THAT WAS TALK ABOUT

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.071
ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE CIVIL

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:55.539
LEGAL SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:57.375
OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE THINGS

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:59.710
THAT IT SHOWS. IS THAT THE

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:01.979
ANSWER ABOUT ACCESS IS VERY

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:03.814
VERY DIFFERENT COURT TO COURT

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:05.349
AND THE COURTS DIDN'T REALLY

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:08.019
HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION OF WHY

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.620
HOW THAT'S WORKING OR WHAT

00:38:09.687 --> 00:38:11.022
THEY'RE WILLING TO DO ABOUT IT.

00:38:11.088 --> 00:38:12.857
AND MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES

00:38:12.923 --> 00:38:14.158
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.793
COMMITTEES EXPRESS A GREAT DEAL

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.828
OF WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.897
COURTS TO FUND TO DO THE RIGHT

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.265
KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING

00:38:21.332 --> 00:38:23.300
TO BE NECESSARY BUT WE LEFT AS

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:25.870
HE THAT HEARING. NOT SURE OF

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:27.204
WHAT DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE

00:38:27.271 --> 00:38:31.242
GOING SO IF THIS IS THESE THREE

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:32.143
BUDGET PROPOSALS IS ALL THERE

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:34.245
IS. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:36.414
MORE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT MAY

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.215
BE COMING OUT FROM JUDICIAL

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:38.783
BRANCH BUT IF THIS IS REALLY

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:40.651
ALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:43.054
ARE TRULY WOEFULLY SHORT. OF A

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.523
BROAD SOLUTION OF ANSWERING THE

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:48.993
QUESTION ABOUT ACCESS WE HAVE

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.760
VERY INCONSISTENT STANDARDS.

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:51.796
COURT THE COURT AND IT SEEMS

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:53.497
EVEN COURTROOM TO COURTROOM

00:38:53.564 --> 00:38:55.466
BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGES.

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:56.600
DECISIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.536
WILLING TO DO OR NOT DO AROUND

00:38:58.602 --> 00:39:00.137
THE PANDEMIC AND AROUND ACCESS

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:02.106
AND SO THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:04.475
I THINK. UNDERMINES THIS NOTION

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:06.377
OF BROAD ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN

00:39:06.444 --> 00:39:08.679
CALIFORNIA. SO I DON'T REALLY

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.481
SEE ENOUGH HEAR OR UNDERSTAND

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:13.184
WHAT TO DO WITH THESE PIECES IF

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:14.485
WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.620
BROADER ACCESS ISSUE. THROUGH

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:19.290
THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO AFTER THE

00:39:19.356 --> 00:39:22.359
PANDEMIC BECAUSE THOSE SAME.

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:24.595
WEAKNESSES IN THE SYSTEM AND

00:39:24.662 --> 00:39:27.231
THE WAY WE FUNDED TRIAL COURTS.

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.899
STILL EXIST EXISTED BEFORE THE

00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.334
PANDEMIC AND THEY ARE GOING TO

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.036
EXIST AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO I'M

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.371
KEEP HOPING THAT WE COULD WORK

00:39:34.438 --> 00:39:35.473
WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT YOU

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.408
DISCUSS WOULD WORK WITH US. IN

00:39:37.475 --> 00:39:39.477
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:42.913
REALLY ARE AND HOW WE RE THINK

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.217
THE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE SOME

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:48.753
STRONGER CONSISTENCY. AMONG ALL

00:39:48.819 --> 00:39:50.387
OF THE COURTS IN THE STATE OF

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:54.158
CALIFORNIA. ON V. THE ISSUE OF

00:39:54.225 --> 00:39:56.427
THE COURT FACILITIES FUNDING TO

00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:57.795
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.029
THE L. A. L. IS RECOMMENDING

00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.631
THAT WE BRING THAT INTO THE

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:04.301
GENERAL FUND AND- BECAUSE OF

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:04.835
THESE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:07.338
FUNDING THE CORE CONSTRUCTION

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.173
ANYWAY HAVE BEEN. IN THE PAST

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.708
BROUGHT INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:40:10.775 --> 00:40:12.543
WHEN THE STATE WAS IN FISCAL

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.880
CRISIS THAT YOU SHOWS THAT THE

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:16.914
SORT OF FUNGIBILITY OF THOSE

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:19.016
FUNDS. THESE OF THE GENERAL

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.684
FUND SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST

00:40:20.751 --> 00:40:22.186
SORT OF DROPPED THE PRETENSE.

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.454
DEAL WITH THAT BUT THEN THAT

00:40:23.521 --> 00:40:25.089
ALSO GIVES AND IT SHOULD GIVE

00:40:25.156 --> 00:40:27.024
THE LEGISLATURE SOME BETTER

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:29.193
INPUT AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.028
THE LONG TERM PLANS ARE A LOT

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:33.063
OF THE- PLANS THAT THE JUDICIAL

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.698
BRANCH IS WORKING ON FOR COURT.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.233
CONSTRUCTION CORPS FACILITIES

00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:38.235
IS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OLD

00:40:38.302 --> 00:40:39.436
AND THIS IS COME UP IN THIS

00:40:39.503 --> 00:40:42.006
COMMITTEE. A NUMBER OF TIMES SO

00:40:42.072 --> 00:40:43.674
FOR US TO HAVE SOME STRONGER

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.109
OVERSIGHT IN THE DECISIONS THAT

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:46.677
ARE BEING MADE WHAT COURTS.

00:40:46.744 --> 00:40:49.480
FACILITIES NEED TO BE MADE AND

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:52.383
WHAT WAS. PART OF A DECISION

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:53.517
TWENTY YEARS AGO ISN'T

00:40:53.584 --> 00:40:55.252
NECESSARILY THE SAME WE

00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:56.320
WOULDN'T SO TO COME TO THE SAME

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.255
CONCLUSION NOW SO FOR. THE

00:40:58.322 --> 00:40:59.089
COURTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER

00:40:59.156 --> 00:41:00.591
CONSTRUCTION IN MOVING FORWARD

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:02.793
I THINK THAT'S FINE. BUT COURTS

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.195
OTHER COURT CONSTRUCTION

00:41:04.261 --> 00:41:05.095
PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE

00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:07.464
PIPELINE I THINK WE NEED TO

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:09.166
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE.

00:41:09.233 --> 00:41:11.802
ADDRESSING THE CURRENT NEEDS.

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.504
OF WHERE THOSE FACILITIES NEED

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:17.341
TO BE BUILT. SO THAT WE HAVE A-

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.442
AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS THAT

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:19.877
ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE THAT'S

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.245
BEEN BROUGHT UP TIME AND TIME

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.247
AGAIN. THAT WE KNOW WHERE THOSE

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:25.049
FACILITIES ARE GOING TO GO IN

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.317
AND THAT THEY'RE GOING INTO THE

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.118
COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.587
MOST RATHER THAN JUST WHAT HAVE

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.589
BEEN ON THE BOOKS. FOR THE LAST

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.190
TWENTY YEARS. SO FOR US TO

00:41:33.257 --> 00:41:35.125
BRING THOSE. THESE PARTS OF

00:41:35.192 --> 00:41:36.293
MONIES INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.495
AND THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:41.031
INSIGHT AND OVERSIGHT OVER THE

00:41:41.098 --> 00:41:42.266
DECISION SICK IT MADE AND WHAT

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.701
THE PIPELINE IS I THINK IT'S

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:45.536
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. SO

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:46.770
THERE'S A LOT THERE'S THIS KIND

00:41:46.837 --> 00:41:49.039
OF INTER TWINED IN WHAT I JUST

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:49.807
SAID THA HAVE TO DO WITH THIS

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:51.976
ISSUE. AND WITH THE WITH THE

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:53.811
NEXT ISSUES COMING UP. BUT IT'S

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:55.179
I WILL TELL YOU IT'S JUST HARD

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:57.114
FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW. ALL

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:59.116
OF THIS. RELATES AND HOW WE

00:41:59.183 --> 00:42:01.585
WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND. A SINGLE

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:03.754
BUDGET THIS YEAR FOR THE COURT

00:42:03.821 --> 00:42:05.856
SYSTEM. AND TRYING TO ADDRESS

00:42:05.923 --> 00:42:08.459
THE PANDEMICS AND I WOULD I

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:11.695
HOPE. AND I WAS SPEAKING FOR

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:12.663
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S AND I

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:13.397
WAS THE NOT THE BUDGET

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.399
SUBCOMMITTEES. WHEN WE OFFERED

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.234
SOME HELP IN THE INTEGRATIVE

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:19.603
WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT FISCALLY

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:20.638
WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THE

00:42:20.704 --> 00:42:22.539
COURTS. ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:24.541
ACCESS THAT THEY NEED AS WE

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.644
COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. BUT

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.779
SO FAR WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE SEEN

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:30.714
FROM THE COURTS. I JUST LEASE

00:42:30.781 --> 00:42:32.182
BECAUSE SCRATCHING MY HEAD I

00:42:32.249 --> 00:42:32.850
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH

00:42:32.917 --> 00:42:34.685
THESE PROPOSALS. THEY'RE NOT

00:42:34.752 --> 00:42:36.453
COMPREHENSIVE. AND WE'RE

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.855
AGAINST WHAT OF PIECE MEALING

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:39.957
OUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE COURTS

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:43.861
BUDGET. AS OPPOSED TO GETTING

00:42:43.928 --> 00:42:44.428
OUR HANDS AROUND. THE BIGGER

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:46.463
PICTURE. SO CONSISTENCY IN

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.666
BUDGETING CONSISTENCY IN ACCESS

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.601
CONSISTENCY COURT TO COURT AND

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.336
COURTROOM TO COURTROOM. TO

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:55.072
ANSWER SOME OF THE- THE ACCESS

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:58.075
ISSUES AND THEN CONSISTENCY IN.

00:42:58.142 --> 00:42:59.843
IN FUNDING AND HOW WE ADDRESS

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.879
THAT IN. REDUCING THE RELIANCE

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.614
OF THE COURTS FUNDING ON THE

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:06.116
FINES AND FEES. AND THIS KIND

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:08.485
OF EXTERNAL STRUCTURE. THAT

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.087
LEADS TO THINGS LIKE NEEDING TO

00:43:10.154 --> 00:43:13.123
DO THE ABILITY TO PAY EXPANSION

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.659
PILOT PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE WE'VE

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:17.227
BUILT A SYSTEM WHERE THE

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:20.030
POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RUN

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:22.066
AFOUL OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:25.602
OUR REALLY DOUBLY PENALIZED

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:27.571
BECAUSE THE WE HAVE STACKED SO

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:30.307
MANY ADD ONS TO THE FINES THAT

00:43:30.374 --> 00:43:31.375
THEY'RE GETTING WE WERE ADDING

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.411
ALL OF THESE FEES. THAT IT IT

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:36.747
IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LANDING

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:37.781
ON THOSE WHO REALLY CANNOT

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.783
AFFORD IT. THAT'S WHAT THESE

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.951
PROPELLER PROGRAMS ARE ABOUT SO

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:42.820
I THINK. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:43.921
THAT WE'RE TAKING A BROADER

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:46.223
LOOK AT COURTS FUNDING GETTING

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.791
THEM THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:51.395
WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE

00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:52.796
MECHANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:53.998
IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS TO

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:55.933
COBBLE TOGETHER. A COURTS

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.968
FUNDING SYSTEM BUT WE NEED TO

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.336
JUST CANCEL WORK WITH US ON

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.238
THIS WE NEED REALLY BETTER

00:44:01.305 --> 00:44:02.973
RELATIONSHIPS AND BETTER

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.342
INFORMATION MOVING BETWEEN.

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:06.977
JUDICIAL BRANCH. THE BUDGET

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:10.080
SUBS AS WELL AS THE JUDICIARY

00:44:10.147 --> 00:44:11.882
COMMITTEE'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.450
POLICY OVERSIGHT. OVER THOSE

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:15.386
COMMITTEES AND THEN REALLY GET

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:16.453
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.622
THE COURTS. NEED TO BE DOING

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.090
AND HOW WE CAN BE HELPING THEM

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:21.959
THROUGH THIS BUDGET CYCLE PUT

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.660
IN PLACE THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.396
NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND NOT DO

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:28.098
IT SORT OF PIECEMEAL LIKE THIS.

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:28.932
SO I HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:31.335
QUESTIONS OTHER THAN HELP US

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.604

CONSISTENT MANNER ACROSS ALL

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.450
FIFTY EIGHT QUARTS. A. N. AND

00:44:46.517 --> 00:44:48.085
HAVING A MORE RATIONAL

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:50.287

COBBLED TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.563
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING WE

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.465
CAN START TO DO A BETTER JOB

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.200

JONES SAWYER- YOU KNOW- WHEN I

00:49:04.341 --> 00:49:07.311
CAME IN A TWENTY TWELVE- I WAS

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:09.112
CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE.

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:11.048
COMPACTORS MY FIRST

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:14.217
CHAIRMANSHIP. AND DURING THAT

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:19.690
TIME. THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH

00:49:19.756 --> 00:49:22.826
THE COURT CONSTRUCTION FUND- AT

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:23.293
THE TIME WE'VE GONE TO

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.264
RECESSION. AND- WE BORROWED TRY

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.465
TO BE TO MONEY TO BALANCE THE

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.635
BUDGET OUR VERY HARD TO TRY TO

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:34.037
RESTORE ALL OF THAT MONEY. BUT

00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.173
IN THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.241
DAN AOC ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:41.545
OF THE COURTS. IT BECAME CLEAR

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:45.816
EARLY ON- IN MY TENURE. THAT B.

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:48.819
B. A. R. C. AND THE COURTS

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:54.024
REALLY PLAYING. WE NEITHER ONE

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:56.226
OF US KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:58.929
WITH THE COURT FUNDING- WHEN

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.597
THINGS WOULD GET DONE HUMMING

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.632
PROJECT COULDN'T GET DONE. HOW

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.701
MANY PROJECTS WERE ON SCHEDULE

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.670
WHICH ONES HADN'T EVEN BEEN

00:50:06.737 --> 00:50:10.207
STARTED. AND AS WE STARTED TO

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:10.841
DIG IN AND DAY AGAIN AND TRY TO

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:15.212
GET. SOME SPECIFIC IDEA OF HOW

00:50:15.278 --> 00:50:17.047
TAXPAYERS MONIES ARE BEING USED.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:19.516
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR OR TWO

00:50:19.583 --> 00:50:21.985
YEARS- THE MINISTRY OF OFFICE

00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:23.653
THE COURT WAS ASKING FOR MORE

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.256
MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:27.157
A REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO GET

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:29.493
THINGS DONE IN ADDITION AT THE

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:32.162
SAME TIME IF I REMEMBER BACK

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:36.400
THEN- DLC WAS TALKING. CLOSING

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:39.002
FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. WHERE

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:41.772
A MOTHER WHO HAD A DOMESTIC

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:43.807
VIOLENCE CLAIM. HAD TO GET ON A

00:50:43.874 --> 00:50:46.743
BUS A HUNDRED MILES AWAY TO GET

00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:48.245
A RESTRAINING ORDER. AND THEY

00:50:48.311 --> 00:50:49.980
WANTED TO CLOSE THE CLOSEST

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:53.717
COURT TODAY AT THAT MOMENT. SO

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:57.120
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THE

00:50:57.187 --> 00:50:58.288
PLANTED KIND OF BRING

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:02.192
EVERYTHING IN. AND ALSO TAKEN

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.728
AWAY FROM THE COURT BACK THEN I

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:06.263
BELIEVE THE PJ'S TO PRESIDING

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:09.399
JUDGES. HEAD UP HEAVY HEAVY

00:51:09.466 --> 00:51:11.868
HAND IN DECIDING HOW COURT

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.503
CONSTRUCTION WITH BUILDINGS AND

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.939
WHAT WOULD BE DONE- I THINK

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.574
EARLY ON WE REALIZED THAT WAS A

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:20.510
HUGE HUGE MISTAKE. AND I WILL

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:23.280
TELL YOU AS SOMEONE. WHO DID

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.281
CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CITY OF

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:27.884
LOS ANGELES. WHEN WE ALLOW L.

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:30.020
A. P. D. THE BILL POLICE

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:33.056
STATIONS- IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE

00:51:33.123 --> 00:51:35.826
AND ALMOST EVERY PROJECT CAME

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:38.995
IN- OVER BUDGET AND RARELY DID

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.997
WE GET THEM DONE ON TIME

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.466
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A POLICE

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:44.568
OFFICER'S CORE CONFIDENCE JUST

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.303
LIKE IT'S NOT A JUDGE'S CORE

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:47.504
COMPETENCE TO DO FACILITIES

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:48.371
MANAGEMENT DEFERRED

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:52.175
MAINTENANCE. OR EVEN TO BE

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.611
RESPONSIBLE. FOR A PROJECT

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:56.480
MANAGEMENT OF A CONSTRUCTION

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.148
PROJECT AND SO WE TOOK THAT OUT

00:51:58.215 --> 00:51:59.983
OF THEIR HANDS IN THE CITY OF

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.151
LOS ANGELES. WE WERE ABLE TO

00:52:01.218 --> 00:52:04.754
GIVE. BUILDINGS DONE ON TIME

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.991
UNDER BUDGET. AND MOST OF ALL

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.359
REPUBLICANS HAVE SOME

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:12.262
CONSISTENCY WHERE IN POLICE

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.998
STATIONS YOU WOULD HAVE. ONE

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:15.799
POLICE CAPTAIN BILL THE TAJ

00:52:15.866 --> 00:52:18.802
MAHAL. OFFICE AND ANOTHER ONE

00:52:18.869 --> 00:52:20.437
WITH BUILDING A FAIRLY MODEST

00:52:20.504 --> 00:52:21.972
AND IT WAS NO CONSISTENCY AND

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:24.875
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME IN- NOT IN

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:27.010
THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR USING

00:52:27.077 --> 00:52:29.479
TAXPAYER MONEY. UP TO WHAT WE

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:31.548
LEARNED IN THE CITY IS YOU NEED

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:33.483
TO BRING. THIS WHOLE

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.821
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN HOUSE.

00:52:37.888 --> 00:52:38.622
GET SOME PROFESSIONALS THAT

00:52:38.688 --> 00:52:40.190
ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:42.425
CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

00:52:45.562 --> 00:52:47.697
UP WITH THE BEST PLAN. TO GET

00:52:47.764 --> 00:52:49.099
THE FACILITIES DONE BECAUSE I

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.668
BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:55.238
SPECIALLY. FOR LOW INCOME AND

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:57.941
MINORITY. AMENITIES IS BASED

00:52:58.008 --> 00:52:59.175
OFF OF WHERE THEY CAN GO TO A-

00:52:59.242 --> 00:53:02.178
AND I DON'T WE'RE- IT ON DAT.

00:53:02.245 --> 00:53:03.613
AS OPPOSED TO A PATIENT ON THE

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.449
CAN. OF A PARTICULAR PJ ARE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:10.253
JUDGED. TO GET TO A COURT. AND

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.389
IS NOT BASED ON WHAT AT NOT IS

00:53:12.455 --> 00:53:14.958
TO BEST FOR THE RESIDENTS IN

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:17.961
THAT AREA. AND SO I WOULD LOVE

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:18.595
TO HAVE US HAVE THAT

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:20.230
CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ALSO

00:53:20.297 --> 00:53:22.165
NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:24.200
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. YOU CAN I

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:26.202
JUST FEEL LIKE WE DESTROY. IN A

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:28.271
LOT OF WAYS AND I KNOW WE HAVE

00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:31.174
NOW DID. COUNCIL BUT IT SEEMS

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:32.876
LIKE THEY HAVE NOT FULLY GOTTEN

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:34.945
OUR HANDS AROUND THIS. IS A LOT

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.180
OF MONEY I MEAN THIS IS A LOT

00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:39.482
OF MONEY THAT WE NEED TO MOVE

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:43.019
ON. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SOME

00:53:43.086 --> 00:53:43.753
DECISIONS ON WHAT WE WILL AND

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.222
WON'T DO. WHAT WE WILL AND

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.891
WE'LL FIND. ABBOTT MOST

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:49.459
IMPORTANT WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:51.161

CAN BE A HELPFUL TOOL TO GUIDE

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.580
THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.714
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:40.216
LEGISLATURE AND RECONSIDER

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.751
FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN SELF HELP

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:43.452
SERVICES. HOWEVER WE ARE

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.887
CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMING OF

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:46.622
THIS ANALYSIS IN PARTICULAR WE

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:47.757
ARE CONCERNED THAT ANALYSIS

01:03:47.823 --> 01:03:49.592
CONDUCTED IT'S TIME WOULD BE

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.460
IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC I

01:03:51.527 --> 01:03:53.062
CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS OUT SELF

01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:54.130
HELP CENTERS ARE GOING TO

01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.631
DRASTIC CHANGES IN THE WAY THEY

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:56.832
ARE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO

01:03:56.899 --> 01:03:57.533
COURT USERS DEVELOPMENT

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.702
TECHNOLOGY IF A COST BENEFIT

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:00.636
STUDY WOULD BE COMPLETED IN THE

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:01.571
BUDGET YEAR AND MAY NOT BE

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:02.905
HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE SINCE THE

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:04.407
ADMINISTRATION OF THE-

01:04:04.473 --> 01:04:05.441
ADMINISTRATION OF SELF HELP

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:13.649
SERVICES. IS CHANGING ITS CUT

01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:14.250
BY THE PENTAGON. AS FOR THE-

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:15.751
PROVISION LANGUAGE. THERE ARE

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:16.352
FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.386
SAN COURT EACH CASE. HAS

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.421
DIFFERENT NEEDS ON SPECIFIC

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:21.023
POPULAR. AS SUCH DIMINISH.

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.925
SUPPORTS THAT SUPPORTS. COURTS

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:24.527
HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.395
SERVICES BASED ON THE UNIQUE

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:29.131
NEEDS OF THEIR QUARTERS. THANK

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:32.802
YOU. THANK YOU ARE AND SO FOR

01:04:32.868 --> 01:04:35.338
JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE COST

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:38.174
BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND- I DO

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.042
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:41.611
DOING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:43.679
NOW BUT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS

01:04:43.746 --> 01:04:46.182
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DONE.

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.651
SO THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND.

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.187
AND WHAT THE OVERALL COST WE'RE

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.855
GOING TO BE WHAT THE FUTURE. OF

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:57.293
THE. SELF HELP CENTERS REALLY

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.528
AREN'T AND HOW WE GET OUR HEADS

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:01.831
AROUND WHAT THAT FINANCING IS I

01:05:01.897 --> 01:05:03.599
ABSOLUTELY AGREE HOW IMPORTANT

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:04.500
HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SELF

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:05.701
HELP CENTERS ARE AS WE'RE

01:05:05.768 --> 01:05:07.570
SEEING SUCH AN INCREASE IN IN

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.372
SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS.

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.841
REALLY ACROSS THE STATE SO HOW.

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:15.444
DO WE- YES L. A. O. HAS A GOOD

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:18.547
POINT THAT THAT WORK ON A COST

01:05:18.614 --> 01:05:19.415
BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS NOT

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.284
COMPLETED AND I THINK THAT'S

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.819
WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM ABOUT

01:05:23.886 --> 01:05:24.420
PROVIDING JUST A COUPLE YEARS

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.889
OF FUNDING. AND DOING SOME

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:29.258
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. HOW DO WE

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.459
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.193
INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.596
NEED. IF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:37.633
IS. MORE CERTAINTY IN THE IN

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:40.202
THE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.736
SEVERAL YEARS OR AT LEAST

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:45.241
BEYOND THE TWO YEARS. L- I AM

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:46.809
HAPPY TO START THAT AT THIS

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.077
POINT WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:49.512
CONTINUATION OF THE FUNDING

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:51.547
ASSETS WERE NOT ASKING FOR

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.416
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THE

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:54.984
CHALLENGE IS AS I SAY THE WE

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:57.153
COLLECTED DATA IN TWENTY

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:58.220
NINETEEN WE HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA

01:05:58.287 --> 01:06:01.891
WAS RECORDED- IN- UP IN THE

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:04.460
COST BENEFIT REPORT. AND ALL OF

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:06.629
THOSE SERVICES HAVE DRIVEN FOR

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:09.932
MEDICALLY CHANGED AS WELL AS-

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.235
THE IMPACT ON THE COURTS SO-

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.371
REVIEWING PAPERS- TAKES A

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:16.706
DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN

01:06:16.772 --> 01:06:19.375
IT'S BEING DONE ELECTRONICALLY-

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:20.509
ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARE JUST

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.878
DIFFERENT. AND ANY DATA THAT

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:24.714
WE'RE USING IS- GOING TO BE

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:26.382
FAIRLY CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:27.616
REALLY MAKING THOSE DIRECTIONS

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.719
MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE AS

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:32.121
HONESTLY POINTS HOW MANY OF THE

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.656
INNOVATIONS THAT WERE.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:37.059
INCORPORATED AS A RESULT OF THE

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:39.729
COST OF THE PANDEMIC. MAY WELL

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.430
BE FABULOUS I MEAN I THINK WE

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:42.998
WANT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.133
REMOTE SERVICES WE WANT TO

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.801
CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE JUST

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:47.937
DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME. WHAT

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:49.705
THAT MAKES IS GOING TO BE LIKE

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.174
WHEN THE PANDEMIC IS OVER AND

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:56.479
SO. IT IS. CRITICAL THAT THERE

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:58.047
IS FLEXIBILITY IN THE COURTS TO

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.049
BE AS INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE

01:07:00.116 --> 01:07:01.951
AS POSSIBLE BUT THEY NEED A

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:04.520
BASELINE. SHOULD BE ABLE TO-

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.155
PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AND

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:08.457
ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO COME

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:13.896
BACK TO YOU. WITH- MORE INFO

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.030
ABOUT ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED BUT I

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:17.099
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. THAT

01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:18.601
THERE IS IT LEASED THE NINETEEN

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.403
BILLION DOLLAR NEED AND THEN

01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:21.771
MOVING FORWARD HOW ARE WE GOING%

01:07:21.837 --> 01:07:23.239
TO DO THAT BUT AT THIS TIME I

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:26.809
THINK IT IS- AS- A MYSTERY BUT

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.477
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW

01:07:28.544 --> 01:07:30.913
WHAT THAT RIGHT MIX OF SERVICES

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:33.149
IS GOING TO BE. OKAY ASSEMBLY

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.684
MEMBER STONE- A COUPLE COMMENTS

01:07:35.751 --> 01:07:36.318
THAT COULD BE HELPFUL FROM THE

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:39.822
L. A- IF IT. WOULD BE HELPFUL

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:42.358
PRETTY GOOD NEARLY. I NEARLY

01:07:42.425 --> 01:07:44.193
WITH THE L. A- SO A COUPLE

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.861
THINGS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.663
IN TERMS OF YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.298
THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ONE

01:07:49.365 --> 01:07:50.099
OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:51.434
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE JUDICIAL

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.135
BRANCH DID DO A LOT OF

01:07:53.202 --> 01:07:56.071
COLLECTION OF DATA. IN TWO

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:56.672
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AS

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.207
WELL AS NINETEEN TWENTY SO IN

01:07:58.274 --> 01:07:58.841
CONTRACTING WITH THE

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.409
RESEARCHER. TO RESEARCHER TO

01:08:00.476 --> 01:08:02.878
FINISH OFF THAT ANNOUNCES THEY

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.480
WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF A

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.081
LOT OF THAT HELPFUL INFORMATION

01:08:06.148 --> 01:08:07.583
THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:09.385
IT. BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:10.519
MAKE USE OF SOME OF THAT

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:11.921
INFORMATION SO I THINK ABOUT

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:13.556
KIND OF THE FIRST THING THAT WE

01:08:13.622 --> 01:08:15.357
WOULD WANT TO- REYES OF KIND OF

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.160
A COMMENT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:19.795
IN IN BOTH THE COMMENTS THAT

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:20.796
ARE BEING RAISED BY THE

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:21.931
JUDICIAL BRANCH AS WELL AS THE

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:22.731
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:24.033
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MIX

01:08:24.099 --> 01:08:25.768
WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE MIX.

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:27.169
THAT GOES BACK TO YOUR COMMENTS

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:29.004
ABOUT WHY A COST BENEFIT

01:08:29.071 --> 01:08:31.507
ANALYSIS IS NECESSARY AND IT IS

01:08:31.574 --> 01:08:32.274
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.109
LEGISLATURE FELT VERY STRONGLY

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:35.344
ABOUT BECAUSE THAT IS THE

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.445
LANGUAGE THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:39.515
INCLUDED AS PART. OF THE TWENTY

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.816
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND SO

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.551
IN LINE WITH THAT AS WE ARE

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.653
OPERATING IN THE PANDEMIC THE

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.788
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:46.555
ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.756
PRIORITIES WHETHER THERE ARE

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.525
CERTAIN MINIMUMS. THAT WE WATCH

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:50.759
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:52.495
BE VERY SPECIFIC YOU WILL SPEND

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:55.264
X. Y. NZ BUT IT CAN'T INVOLVED

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:56.699
SAYING AT THE MINIMUM WE SHOULD

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.134
BE DEDICATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.035
THIS AMOUNT. TO THAT DELIVERY

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.403
AND THAT'S METHOD OR YOU KNOW

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.638
IN OTHER PRIORITIES OTHER

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.173
METICULOUSLY BY THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:08.277
SO HOPEFULLY. THAT'S HELPFUL.

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.311
THAT IS. AND THEN I UNDER. THAT

01:09:09.378 --> 01:09:10.412
AND THAT'S WE'RE- WE'RE

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.947
DEFINITELY DEALING WITH SOME

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:15.451
DIFFERENCES THIS YEAR. OR

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:16.051
TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:09:16.118 --> 01:09:17.419
ONE. NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNING

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.455
WITH THE FISCAL YEARS. IN THE

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:21.490
LEGISLATURE DID ASK FOR SOME OF

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:22.858
THAT INFORMATION THAT WASN'T

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:25.728
COMPLETED. THAT MY FRUSTRATION

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.563
ALSO COMES FROM DAY HEARING

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:28.230
THAT WE HELD ON ACCESS TO

01:09:28.297 --> 01:09:30.099
COURTS WHERE A LOT. THE ANSWER

01:09:30.165 --> 01:09:31.133
TO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS FROM

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.701
JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS WE'RE

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.503
COLLECTING DATA. WILL COLLECT

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:38.307
MORE DATA AT SOME POINT. WE'VE

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:40.409
GOT TO GET ACCESS TO THAT DATA

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.911
TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.113
WHAT ALL OF THAT MEANS. IN

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:46.615
ORDER TO PROVIDE HOW WE MOVE

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.117
FORWARD AND SO JUST CONTINUING

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:52.621
THAT MONEY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S.

01:09:52.688 --> 01:09:53.789
NOT AN UNREASONABLE ASK AT THIS

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.958
POINT BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT

01:09:56.025 --> 01:09:57.126
TO SELF HELP CENTERS ARE

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.827
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WILL

01:09:58.894 --> 01:09:59.862
BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INTO

01:09:59.929 --> 01:10:01.630
THE FUTURE HOW THEY INNOVATE

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:05.067
AND HOW THEY PROVIDE. BENEFITS

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:06.602
TO. OUR CONSTITUENTS IS REALLY

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:09.405
VERY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:11.073
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.709
MEANS HOW THAT WORKS IN ORDER

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:14.877
TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING

01:10:14.944 --> 01:10:16.645
THE CORRECT LEVEL OF FUNDING

01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:19.214
AND I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO THAT

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:21.450
MR REMINDS COMMENT THAT WE A

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:23.485
FIFTY EIGHT COURTS AND- WE

01:10:23.552 --> 01:10:25.187
DON'T WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:25.721
IN THOSE COURTS THEY HAVE

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:28.657
DIFFERENT. NEEDS AND DIFFERENT

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:31.894
PEOPLE YES TO A POINT BUT THIS

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:33.362
IS I THINK ALSO WERE WE GET

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:35.731
WRAPPED AROUND SOME PROBLEMS

01:10:35.798 --> 01:10:37.900
HERE IN THAT WE HAVE FIFTY

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:39.201
EIGHT COURTS THAT WANT TO BE

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.704
VERY INDEPENDENT. AND DO THINGS

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.405
THEIR OWN WAY WHICH MAY OR MAY

01:10:43.472 --> 01:10:45.441
NOT BE A GOOD THING. AND IS

01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.076
LEADING TO DIFFERENCES IN

01:10:47.142 --> 01:10:49.378
ACCESS TO JUSTICE COURT TO

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:51.647
COURT TO COURT. AND EVEN SOME

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:53.949
OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE GOT IN

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.485
OUR HEARING PREVIOUSLY. THE TO

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:57.886
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES HAD

01:10:57.953 --> 01:10:59.088
THAT HEARING ON ACCESS TO

01:10:59.154 --> 01:11:00.489
JUSTICE THERE SEEMS TO BE

01:11:00.556 --> 01:11:01.890
DIFFERENT RESPONSES FROM

01:11:01.957 --> 01:11:03.492
COURTROOM TO COURTROOM MEANING

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.394
DIFFERENT JUDGES WANT TO

01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.129
MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE SO

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.764
STRIDENTLY THAT THEY'RE MAKING

01:11:08.831 --> 01:11:10.699
THEIR OWN DECISIONS. THAT

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:13.736
AFFECT ACCESS SO HOW I WANT TO

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:14.837
MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING SELF

01:11:14.903 --> 01:11:16.205
HELP CENTERS BECAUSE I BELIEVE

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.707
THAT THOSE ARE CRITICAL. FOR

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:20.009
UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS AND

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.377
THAT'S A THAT'S ACTUALLY A BIG

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.611
PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULDN'T JUST

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.279
PAPER OVER BY SINGLE WE HAVE

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:25.981
SELF HELP CENTERS. THAT'S

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.816
WHAT'S GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:28.350
ACCESS TO JUSTICE BECAUSE

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.985
WITHOUT. APPROPRIATE

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:31.520
PROFESSIONALS HELPING THEM WITH

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:33.122
THE LEGAL SYSTEM THEY ARE AT A

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:36.058
DISADVANTAGE. BUT I'M ALSO VERY

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:39.128
WORRIED ABOUT. THIS DESIRE TO

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:41.063
ALLOW FIFTY EIGHT COURTS TO DO

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:43.999
THEIR OWN THING ALL THE TIME

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:46.235
WITHOUT SOME CONSISTENCY.

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:47.503
ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:49.004
BECAUSE WE DO IN FACT HAVE A

01:11:49.071 --> 01:11:51.874
STATEWIDE SYSTEM. NOT A

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.109
CONGLOMERATION OF FIFTY EIGHT.

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:57.513
DIFFERENT LITTLE FIEFDOMS SO.

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.380
WE DON'T WANT TO STIFLE

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.382
INNOVATION WE WANNA MAKE SURE

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:03.452
THAT. THAT THE SELF HELP

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.920
CENTERS AND IN IN ALL OF THESE

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.756
CATEGORIES COURTS ARE ABLE TO

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:09.758
DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BUT

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:12.127
ALSO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER HOW

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:15.364
SOME CONSISTENCY AND HAVE IT

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:16.999
LEASED THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.701
ACCESS ACROSS ALL OF THE

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:22.071
COURTS. SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT

01:12:22.137 --> 01:12:22.638
TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY OR TOO

01:12:22.705 --> 01:12:28.010
MUCH- OF A AN ALLOWANCE FOR

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:29.878
THAT FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT

01:12:29.945 --> 01:12:33.015
COURTS AND HOW NEAT THAT IS

01:12:33.082 --> 01:12:33.682
THAT THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:37.186
INDEPENDENCE. SO I THINK WHAT.

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:38.821
IT'S A TOUGH THING FOR US TO

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.889
KNOW WHAT EXACTLY TO DO. THESE

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.691
OF THE THIS YEAR AND MOVING

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:45.694
FORWARD- SO THAT'S NOT FOR ME

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:47.129
NOT UNREASONABLE REQUEST AND

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:47.996
THE COMMITTEES GOT A KIND OF

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.898
SORT THROUGH THAT THE NINETEEN

01:12:49.965 --> 01:12:53.268
MILLION DOLLARS- ASK. BUT I DO

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.571
AGREE WITH ALEJO THAT JUDICIAL

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.139
COUNCIL HAS COLLECTED A LOT OF

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.375
DATA YOU GOT TO START PUTTING

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.410
SOME OF THAT TOGETHER. AND MAKE

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:03.912
THAT RELATABLE TO US SO THAT WE

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:06.815
UNDERSTAND. WHAT THOSE WHAT THE

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.183
FUTURE OF THE SELF HELP CENTERS

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.251
ARE GOING TO BE SO THAT WE CAN

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.153
ADEQUATELY FUNDED. BECAUSE WHAT

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.287
OUR HOPE YOU'RE HEARING IS THAT

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.123
THERE IS AN INTEREST IN MAKING

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.724
SURE WE ADEQUATELY FUND THOSE

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.726
THEY ARE GOING TO BE KEY.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:20.028
UNFORTUNATELY TO. REALLY

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:21.797
PROVIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:24.433
SORRY- OTHER MEMBERS THE

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.635
COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:29.538
JONES SAWYER AND I THINK WE'RE

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.039
ALL OF THIS IS NOT MUTUALLY

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:34.309
EXCLUSIVE I THINK WE ALL AGREE

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:37.946
THAT- SELF HELP CENTERS ARE NOT

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:40.115
ONLY IMPORTANT I LIKE TO ADD

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:42.017
ONE ADDITIONAL UP THEY COULD BE

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.685
THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. AND

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.053
ALSO COULD HELP US WITH OUR

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.421
BRICK AND MORTAR PROBLEM WITH

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:49.324
PLANTS IF MORE PEOPLE ARE ABLE

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.527
TO GO ONLINE AND ABLE TO HANDLE

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.796
THEIR JUDICIAL THE CARD

01:13:53.862 --> 01:13:55.931
BUSINESS ON LINE. THAT WILL

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:57.766
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:13:57.833 --> 01:14:00.736
SHOWING UP AT COURT DID DO VERY

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:05.541
SIMPLE MENIAL TASKS THAT CAN BE

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.875
HANDLED- ONLINE. AND THEN

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:09.812
INVESTMENT IN THIS IS CRITICAL

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.346
NOT ONLY FOR DISADVANTAGED AND

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:15.050
POOR FOLKS. IT COULD BE THE

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:17.085
WAVE OF THE FUTURE THAT COULD

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:19.588
TAKE THIS COURT SYSTEM. INTO

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:22.758
THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:27.062
BEYOND. AND SO. ASKING THAT

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.164
AFTER TWO YEARS YEAR AND A HALF

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.500
THAT WE GET INFORMATION TO MAKE

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:33.168
CRITICAL DECISIONS ON HOW WE

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.603
MOVE FORWARD I THINK IS

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:37.005
IMPORTANT AND THAT WE SHOULD

01:14:37.072 --> 01:14:41.043
NOT JUST GIVE MONEY. BECAUSE

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.778
WE'RE AFRAID THAT WE MAY NOT

01:14:42.845 --> 01:14:44.780
GET FUNDED. AND THE NEXT TWO

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.716
YEARS AFTER THAT. IN FACT IF

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:48.517
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THAT THAT

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.386
MAKES ME EVEN MORE CONCERNED.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.722
IF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.458
SETTING UP. IS YOUR FREIGHT

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:58.827
THAT A. N. N. NOT AN AUDIT BUT

01:14:58.894 --> 01:15:00.796
A AN EVALUATION OF WHERE YOU'RE

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:06.168
GOING- MAY RESULT IN THIS BODY.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.070
NOT FINDING YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:15:08.136 --> 01:15:08.537
GOING IN IN THE WRONG

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:11.106
DIRECTION. I'M VERY CONCERNED.

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.075
THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:15.277
FAITH. THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.913
SUCH A GOOD JOB. THAT NOT ONLY

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.481
WILL WE FIND YOU THE NEXT TEN

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:20.549
YEARS BECAUSE WILL HAVE

01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.284
EMPIRICAL DATA THAT ACTUALLY

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.453
PROVES. NOT ONLY YOUR VALIDITY

01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:28.457
BUT HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING IT-

01:15:28.523 --> 01:15:31.093
IS A CONCERN. SO I DON'T THINK

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.228
WE'RE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. I

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:37.499
JUST THINK. THAT THE COURTS

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:39.268
JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OTHERS

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.770
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:45.274
A SYSTEM. THAT COULD NOT ONLY

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.676
STATEWIDE BE USE BY MAYBE

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:50.145
NATIONALLY EVEN INTERNATIONALLY

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.947
A KEY COULD BE USED IN THE

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:54.016
FUTURE IF WE CAN NOW INVEST IN

01:15:54.082 --> 01:15:56.551
IT. BUT MOST IMPORTANT WE

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:59.187
ACTUALLY TWEAK IT TO MAKE SURE

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:02.190
THAT- IT IS FUNCTIONING THE WAY

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:04.393
WE WANT TO AND SO I YOU KNOW I

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:07.062
CAN LOOK. AT AND NOT TRY TO DO

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:09.064
A COLLABO ALBUM IF BUT IF SOME

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:10.799
REASON TRYING TO DO A COMPILER

01:16:10.866 --> 01:16:12.467
AND I LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH.

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:14.736
FINANCE IN LA- DO YOU KIND OF

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:17.773
SEE IT THAT WAY THAT WE'RE ALL

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.675
WE ALL- ONE TO SEE A ROBUST

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.176
SELF HELP CENTER. AND HOW CAN

01:16:21.243 --> 01:16:27.683
WE GET THERE. I COMPLY IF YOU

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:28.984
DON'T MIND HEARING FROM THE

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.619
JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABSOLUTELY

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:33.555
HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THE-

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.724
DATA SHOWING THE NEED FOR

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:38.193
EXPANDED ASSISTANCE AND I HOPE

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.262
THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:40.829
TO READ THE REPORT BECAUSE I

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:42.998
THINK IT PROVIDES. INCREDIBLY

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:44.199
HELPFUL INFORMATION THE

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:46.501
CERTAINLY HELPFUL FOR ME TO YOU

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:48.236
KNOW WHEN IT'S WINTER WORKSHOPS

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.539
HELPFUL ON WHAT CASE TYPES HOW

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:51.807
LONG TWO THIRDS CERTAIN THINGS

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:54.109
TAKE WHEN DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:56.044
DO ONE ON ONE VERSUS A WORKSHOP

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.580
AND AS THEY SAY MOVING FORWARD-

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.515
WE WILL HAVE WILL. ABSOLUTELY

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:05.053
CONTINUE THAT WORK- I THINK THE

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.356
CHALLENGE IS. WE KNOW THAT WE

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:09.291
HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE NEED RIGHT

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:12.361
NOW AND- IT TAKING THE

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.262
RESOURCES AWAY FROM THAT WORK

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:17.699
IS- IS CERTAINLY CONCERNING BUT

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:18.900
I DO THINK I THINK THAT THE

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.169
REPORT THAT WE PROVIDED- WILL

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:22.838
PROVIDE ENORMOUS GUIDANCE

01:17:22.904 --> 01:17:24.573
MOVING FORWARD AND ABSOLUTELY

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:25.974
CONTINUE. THAT WE WOULD BE

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:29.011
DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE- AS WE

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.912
CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT

01:17:30.979 --> 01:17:34.783
HOW TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE- IN

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:43.025
THIS NEW THIS NEW WORLD. I NEED.

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:45.027
I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A. L.

01:17:45.093 --> 01:17:46.261
IN LINE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.663
JONES SAWYER IS QUESTIONS- WE

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.098
DO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT THAT

01:17:50.165 --> 01:17:51.600
COMES FROM SELF HELP DOLLARS I

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:52.701
THINK THE REAL THEY'RE THE

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:54.403
REASON WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.270
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN THE

01:17:55.337 --> 01:17:57.339
NEED FOR IT IS THAT'S WHAT

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.207
GIVES YOU THE INFORMATION ABOUT

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:01.176
WHERE YOU CAN PUT DOLLARS TO

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.445
MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT FOR

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:05.080
INDIVIDUALS HER BEING SERVED

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.248
AND THERE IS A RECOGNITION

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:07.416
THERE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.184
CASE TYPES- YOU KNOW FOR

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:10.419
EXAMPLE GUARDIANSHIP OR

01:18:10.485 --> 01:18:11.853
CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT LEND

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.955
ITSELF BETTER FOR IN PERSON

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:15.290
SERVICE AND THE OTHER CASE

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:17.125
TYPES- UNITS FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.326
YOU'RE STARTING OFF WITH FAMILY

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:19.795
LAW PROCEEDINGS THAT MIGHT LEND

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:22.197
ITSELF BETTER TOWARDS WORKSHOPS

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.099
AND TO TALK ABOUT MAXIMIZING

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:25.367
THE USE OF RESOURCES WHEN YOU

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.702
KNOW YOU NEED ONE ON ONE- TO

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.237
THE BEST OF TIMES FLEXIBLE AND

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:31.306
IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT THE

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.175
LEGISLATURE AS IT'S THINKING

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.876
ABOUT HOW TO FIND A VARIETY OF

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:37.813
PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE THAT

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:40.582
THERE IS- ANY NEED AT THAT

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:41.650
CONVENTION CUT COULD

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.685
POTENTIALLY BE HIGHER. AND THE

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:44.719
DOLLAR VALUE THAT THE

01:18:44.786 --> 01:18:46.988
LEGISLATURE- IS ABLE TO KIND OF

01:18:47.055 --> 01:18:48.790
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR AND SO WE

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:50.392
REALLY FOCUS ON BASICALLY THAT

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:51.560
CLASS BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:53.161
REALLY FOCUSED ON HELPING TO

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.130
MAXIMIZE USE OF EVERY DOLLAR

01:18:55.197 --> 01:19:00.068
THAT IS PUT IN. FOR SOUTH OF

01:19:00.135 --> 01:19:05.273
DOLLARS. THANK YOU. MR LACKING

01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:06.808

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.344
MICHAEL ROOM AT I DO BUT THAT.

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:10.679
L. L. SUGGESTION OF A COST

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:13.248
BENEFIT ANALYSIS WOULD WOULD

01:19:13.315 --> 01:19:16.318
JUST HELP US BECOME WHAT THE

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:18.053
VOTERS EXPECT US TO BE IN AND

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.422
BE GOOD STEWARDS OF- MAKING

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.023
SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CLARITY

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.792
AND SOME CONFIDENCE IN

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.560
MAXIMIZING THAT IMPACT WAS JUST

01:19:25.627 --> 01:19:27.729
TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE

01:19:27.796 --> 01:19:29.397
HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ALL

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.266
THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL IS VERY

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:32.834
DIFFICULT BUT I THINK THAT

01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.936
THAT'S WHERE. WE NEED TO

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:36.171
COLLABORATE AND DISCUSS WITH

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.672
EACH OTHER TRYING TO FIND THE

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.474
BALANCE BETWEEN FLEXIBILITY AND

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.943
CONTROL BECAUSE- COMPLETE

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.379
INDEPENDENCE OFTEN DOESN'T

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.414
ALLOW US TO MAXIMIZE OUR OUR

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.583
BEST USE OF FUNDS EITHER SO-

01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.585
I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL PURSUE

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:52.621
IN THE FUTURE A MORE DETAILED

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:55.824
COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SO THAT

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:59.628
WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS.

ENSURE THAT THE TOOL IS READILY

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:54.002

WAS HELPFUL. IN RESPONSE TO A

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.483
QUESTION ASKING EXACTLY WHAT

FACTORS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO

ALTERNATIVE FOR NUMBER. CIVIL

01:23:22.297 --> 01:23:25.567
SO AND BEEN SUGGESTED SO WE GOT-BACK LOOKED AT THE DATA

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:26.701
DEVELOPED BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:27.836
WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS

01:23:27.902 --> 01:23:29.771
PROPOSAL MIGHT BE. AND THERE

01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:30.839
ARE TWO ITEMS THAT I CAN

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:32.374
HIGHLIGHT IS AND ASK IF YOU

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.976
CONSIDER. FIRST I WANT TO NOTE

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:35.910
THAT IF THE PROPOSAL WERE TO GO

01:23:35.977 --> 01:23:37.412
FORWARD. LOW INCOME

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.147
CALIFORNIANS WHO RESPOND TO

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:42.016
THEIR TICKETS ON TIME WOULD

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:42.617

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.053
TO OUR DATA OVER 50% OF ATG

SUPPORT SYSTEM. I'M EXCITATIONS

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.527

THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD RECEIVE

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.705
NO BENEFIT. SECOND A SERVICEMAN

01:24:03.772 --> 01:24:05.373
IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATOR

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.809
OF POVERTY. WELL CERTAINLY LOW

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:08.910
INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:10.111
LIKELY TO HAPPEN CIVIL

01:24:10.178 --> 01:24:11.846

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.715

01:24:13.782 --> 01:24:14.816
SIMPLE ASSESSMENT IS

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.985
NECESSARILY LOW INCOME. SO WE

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.052
HOPE THAT YOU'LL APPROVED THIS

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:20.054
PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TARGETED

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:21.189

01:24:24.292 --> 01:24:29.931

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:41.242
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU ON THIS

01:24:41.309 --> 01:24:43.578
ITEM- FIRST WE ACTUALLY

01:24:43.645 --> 01:24:44.546
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.381
REJECTS THE PROPOSED TRAILER

01:24:46.448 --> 01:24:47.682

01:24:50.518 --> 01:24:52.520
THE POOL STATEWIDE- AND THIS IS

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.722
BECAUSE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:55.957
PROCESS OF BEING ROLLED OUT

01:24:56.024 --> 01:24:58.092
SUCH AS ONLINE TRIALS- THAT

SHOULD BE COMING OUT AND BEING

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.896
TESTED IN THE SPRING AND SO

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:02.530
THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON

01:25:02.597 --> 01:25:04.866
COSTS. ADDITIONALLY AND

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.801
EVALUATION OF A COMPLETED PILOT

01:25:06.868 --> 01:25:08.903
IS REALLY HELPFUL TO ACCURATELY

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:09.871
DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:12.106
VARIOUS ACTIVITIES BEING TESTED

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:12.941
TO THEN INFORM FUTURE

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:15.210
LEGISLATIVE- DECISION SO FOR

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.544
EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.112
TO CONSIDER A HIGHER AUTOMATIC

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.614
REDUCTION FOR LOWER INCOME

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.516
INDIVIDUALS OR REDUCTIONS FOR

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:24.085
INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T CURRENTLY%

01:25:24.152 --> 01:25:24.719
QUALIFY UNDER THE DEFINITION OF

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:26.788
LOW INCOME- BUT OUR SECOND

01:25:26.855 --> 01:25:27.956
RECOMMENDATION IS IF THE

01:25:28.022 --> 01:25:29.357
LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MOVE

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:30.859
FORWARD AND EXPANDS THE

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.160
AVAILABILITY OF THE OF THE

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.428
ABILITY TO QUE PIECE OF THE

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.296
TALK WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:25:35.363 --> 01:25:37.065
LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROVED THE

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:38.233
TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:39.968
REQUESTED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.903
AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE LOWER

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.538
INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH THE

01:25:43.605 --> 01:25:46.574
RELIEF- BUT IT WOULD PREVENT

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.276
THE PROGRAM FROM AUTOMATICALLY

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:50.178
ROLLING OUT BEYOND THE TEN

01:25:50.245 --> 01:25:51.846
PORTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED

01:25:51.913 --> 01:25:54.182
USING THESE DOLLARS- AFTER THE

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.350
BUDGET YEAR BEFORE THE

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:56.551
LEGISLATURE HAS A CHANCE TO

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.219
SORT OF EVALUATE TAKE THE

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.521
INFORMATION FROM THE EVALUATION

01:25:59.587 --> 01:26:01.556
THAT STILL AND USE THAT AS PART

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.892
OF ITS DELIBERATIONS- THE FINAL

01:26:03.958 --> 01:26:05.326
PIECES THIS TRAILER BILL

01:26:05.393 --> 01:26:07.462
LANGUAGE DOES INCLUDE- LANGUAGE

01:26:07.529 --> 01:26:08.563
THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ALL

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.266
INFRACTION PROCEEDINGS TO OCCUR

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:14.369
REMOTELY- AND SO ON THAT ONE IF

01:26:14.435 --> 01:26:15.403
THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:16.738
IN IMPROVING ITBECAUSE IT DOES

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:17.906
HAVE BENEFITS OF PROMOTING

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.841
EQUITY AND INCREASING ACCESS.

01:26:19.908 --> 01:26:21.175
WE O RECOMMENDS THAT THE

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:22.410
LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE JUDICIAL

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.379
BRANCH TO SUBMIT AN EVALUATION

01:26:24.445 --> 01:26:26.414
OR REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.916
OF THE LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO

01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:29.250
INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:30.718
DECISIONS IN THIS AREA SUCH AS

01:26:30.785 --> 01:26:31.853
WHETHER TO EXPAND REMOTE

01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.421
PROCEEDINGS TO OTHER CASE TYPES

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:38.359
FOR EXAMPLE IS. REALLY RIGHT

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:39.294
NOW THE IMPACT ON COURT

01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.029
WORKLOAD AND HOSTAGE ANOTHER.

01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:47.735
THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE

01:26:47.802 --> 01:26:49.704
ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.

01:26:49.771 --> 01:26:52.106
I JUST ZERO NINE DEPARTMENT

01:26:52.173 --> 01:26:54.676
FINANCE GO AHEAD. BASED ON

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:56.311
PRELIMINARY DATA WE KNOW THAT

01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:57.645
THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDING

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.080
SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL RELIEF

01:26:59.147 --> 01:27:00.415
TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO

01:27:00.481 --> 01:27:02.283
CURRENTLY FACE UNDUE FINANCIAL

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:04.285
HARDSHIP FROM FINES AND FEES

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:05.353
UNFORTUNATELY THIS RELIEF IS

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:06.154
CURRENTLY LIMITED TO

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.056
INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN ONE OF

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.591
THE SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES

01:27:09.657 --> 01:27:10.491
PARTICIPATING IN THE PILOT

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.393
PROGRAM GIVEN THE BURDEN FINES

01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:13.628
AND FEES IMPOSED ON WELCOME

01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:15.363
CALIFORNIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:16.364
COMPOUNDED BY THE RECENT

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:17.699
IMPACTS FROM THE ECONOMIC

01:27:17.765 --> 01:27:19.567
RECESSION. WE STILL THERE'S AN

01:27:19.634 --> 01:27:20.234
OUTAGE WE FEEL THERE IS AN

01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:21.736
URGENT NEED TO EXTEND TARGET

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:22.971
REALLY WALLOWING COMMITTEE

01:27:23.037 --> 01:27:24.305
BIGGLES REGARDLESS OF WHERE

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:26.307
THEY LIVE FURTHERMORE THIS

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:27.342
PROPOSAL ALLOWS FOR THE

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.509
TRAVELERS TO MODERNIZE THEIR

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:29.577
OPERATIONS WITH ADDITIONAL

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:30.912
FEATURES SUCH AS ONLINE

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:32.580
EDUCATION INFRACTIONS WHICH

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:33.781
FURTHER PROMOTES ACCESS TO

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.717
JUSTICE FOR COURT USERS ONLINE

01:27:35.783 --> 01:27:37.385
EDUCATION OF INFRACTIONS IS

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.519
ALSO CRITICAL TO PROMOTE

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:39.654
PHYSICAL DISTANCING WHICH

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:40.888
MEDICAID PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:42.223
FACED BY CALIFORNIANS.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:44.759
OTHERWISE AFTERSHOW TO REPORT

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.494
DURING THE ACADEMIC INFRACTION

01:27:46.561 --> 01:27:48.930
GENERALLY ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.398
60% OF COURT FILINGS WHICH

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:51.833
MEANS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:27:51.899 --> 01:27:53.134
IN THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:54.068
PEOPLE WHAT COULD ACTUALLY

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:55.269
BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:56.537
EDUCATE THEIR INFRACTIONS

01:27:56.604 --> 01:27:58.339
REMOTELY RATHER THAN GOING INTO

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.408
THE PORT. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT

01:28:00.475 --> 01:28:01.943
HAVE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING

01:28:02.010 --> 01:28:03.878
RESULTS ON THE HIGHWAY AS

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:18.593
FIRST OF THIS YEAR

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.261
INTERMINGLING. WE'RE PROPOSING

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.729
A PHASED ROLLOUT OF THE PROGRAM

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.164
AND ITS ADDITIONAL IT DOES NOT

01:28:23.231 --> 01:28:25.099
MAKE IT BECOMES AVAILABLE BASED

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.201
ON THE REPORT JUNE TWENTY

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:27.902
TWENTY TWO WILL BE ABLE TO

COURSE CORRECT AND MAKE ANY

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.104
NECESSARY CHANGES AS WE MOVE

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:39.580
FORWARD. WITH THIS PROCESS

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.850
THANK YOU. AT THANK YOU A

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.686
APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S- I A

01:28:44.752 --> 01:28:45.887
QUESTION- BEFORE OPEN UP THE

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:49.791
COMMITTEE. SO WE KNOW THAT THE

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:52.326
PILOTS ARE SHOWING THAT. YOU

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.295
SET THE COURTS ARE FOLLOWING

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.531
THE RECOMMENDATION- BUT WE DO

01:28:56.597 --> 01:28:57.532
KNOW THAT IF I CONSISTENT

01:28:57.598 --> 01:28:59.300
ACROSS ACROSS THE COUNTIES THAT

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.135
WE SEE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS-

01:29:01.202 --> 01:29:02.236
AND DIFFERENT COURT ROOMS OUT

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:05.139
THERE AND SO HOW CAN WE ENSURE

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:08.443
THAT WE HAVE MORE CONSISTENCY

01:29:08.509 --> 01:29:13.181
ACROSS THE COUNTIES. IF I MAY

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:14.415
MADAM CHAIR THIS IS SHELLY

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:15.416
BERMAN WITH THE JUDICIAL

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.186
COUNCIL- WHEN THE LEGISLATION

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:19.687
WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED BY THE

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.489
LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:24.625
REQUESTED THAT- LANGUAGE BE

01:29:24.692 --> 01:29:26.227
INCLUDED WHERE PEOPLE RECEIVE

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.129
AT LEAST A 50% AFFECT WHICH

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.631
WOULD RECOMMEND A 50% BENEFIT.

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:34.736
SOME COURTS CHOSE TO PROVIDE-

01:29:34.802 --> 01:29:37.038
GREATER RELIEF- BECAUSE THAT

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:39.774
WORKS FOR THEM VOCALLY AND SO

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:41.242
MOST COURTS HAVE FOLLOWED WITH

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:43.111
THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUGGESTED

01:29:43.177 --> 01:29:44.112
OTHER COURTS HAVE GONE A LITTLE

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.147
BIT FURTHER- BUT WHAT WE REALLY

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:48.616
HOPE FOR IS. A DISCRETION

01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:49.751
BECAUSE WITH JUDICIAL OFFICERS

01:29:49.817 --> 01:29:51.552
DO IS THEY LOOK AT THE FACTS OF

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:52.286
THE CASE AND THEN MAKE A

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:54.355
DETERMINATION. I WILL NOTE

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.224
THAT- CONSUMERS ARE RECEIVING

01:29:56.290 --> 01:29:58.693
ABOUT A 54% THAT'S THE AVERAGE

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.829
REDUCTION. AND AROUND 70% OF

01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:04.198
THE TIME- THE JUDICIAL OFFICERS

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:09.504
ARE WITHIN TEN DOLLARS OF. THE

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:10.104
AMOUNT THAT'S RECOMMENDED FROM

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:17.178
THE FULL. MEMBERS. I DON'T HAVE

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:19.247
A CONSISTENT WITH WITH WHAT WE

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.415
SAID BEFORE I WONDER FOR GOING

01:30:21.482 --> 01:30:22.817
ABOUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:24.385
BECAUSE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:25.219
THE RISEN FROM THE FEE

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:27.889
STRUCTURE IN THE IN THE COURTS

01:30:27.955 --> 01:30:30.291
AND FIND THAT WE'RE DOING THIS

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:32.560
AND PROVIDING SOME RELIEF BUT

01:30:32.627 --> 01:30:35.396
THAT'S DETRIMENTAL TO HOW WE

01:30:35.463 --> 01:30:37.331
FINANCE THE COURT SYSTEMS AND

01:30:37.398 --> 01:30:40.601
BECAUSE WE'VE JUST PUT OFF THAT

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:43.070
DISCUSSION AND BUILT A SYSTEM

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:45.306
WHERE. THESE FEES AND FINES ARE

01:30:45.373 --> 01:30:47.074
ARE SO IMPORTANT WE'RE NOT

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.242
HAVING TO COME AROUND AND IN

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:50.578
PROVIDE A PILOT TO LOOK AT THE

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:52.446
BILLION TO PAY WHEN WE REALLY

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:54.615
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE AT.

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:56.818
THE UNDERLYING. WAY THAT WE

01:30:56.884 --> 01:30:58.786
HAVE BUILT THE SYSTEM SO I HOPE

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:00.254
THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL

01:31:00.321 --> 01:31:02.490
REMAIN ON THE TABLE AND WE'RE

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:06.861
NOT JUST GOING TO BE. LOOKING

01:31:06.928 --> 01:31:10.064
AT AT A RELIEF TO. A FINANCING

01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:14.101
MECHANISM- THIS ABILITY TO PAY

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:16.037
PILOT PROGRAM WITHOUT REALLY

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:18.039
LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE

01:31:18.105 --> 01:31:19.874
OF WHY WE GOT TO THE SITUATION

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.609
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT.

01:31:21.676 --> 01:31:25.780
IN THE FUTURE SO. I THINK THIS

01:31:25.847 --> 01:31:28.015
IS GOOD AS FAR AS IT IS BUT I

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.383
THINK WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE

01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.752
HARD LOOK AT THE WHAT WE'VE

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:41.562
BEEN RELYING ON TO FUND. COURTS.

01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:43.064
NORTHERN OR FURTHER QUESTIONS

WITH YOUR SEARCH FOR THE

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:53.741
JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THAT'S

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:54.876
PROPOSAL IS TRAILER BILL

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:56.544

01:31:59.146 --> 01:32:00.081
IMPORTANT PART OF THE BRAND'S

01:32:00.147 --> 01:32:01.949
POST CONDIMENT BUDGET TIME TO

WAS THROUGH REMOTE OPERATIONS.

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:39.814
AND THE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO DO

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.015

INCLUDING JURY TRIALS. WHAT WE

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:36.303
LEARNED FROM THIS WAS THE

01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:37.705
REMOTE PROCEEDINGS GAVE US

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:40.241
TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FIRST AND

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:01.762
TO SIT IN THE COURTHOUSE

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:04.065
PERHAPS ALL DAY FOR A COURT

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:06.467

LITIGANTS NOW CAN ACCESS THEIR

PARTICIPATE FULLY REMOTELY

01:35:15.176 --> 01:35:16.844
WITHOUT THAT SUBSTANTIAL

01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:19.513
ALTERATION TO THEIR SCHEDULE.

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.916
SIGNALLY ATTORNEYS WHO

01:35:21.982 --> 01:35:23.184

CALENDARS NOW ARE ABLE TO

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:28.189
REPRESENT MULTIPLE CLIENTS IN

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:30.825
MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. THIS

01:35:30.891 --> 01:35:34.462
BENEFIT BENEFITS THE LITIGANTS

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.397
WHO ARE HIRING THE ATTORNEYS

01:35:36.464 --> 01:35:37.965
BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO

01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.700
PAY THOSE TRAVEL COSTS THEY NO

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:42.169
LONGER HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TIME

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:42.770
THAT THE ATTORNEYS ARE WAITING

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:45.039
IN COURT. NOW THESE ACCESS

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:47.308
OPPORTUNITIES ARE WHAT WE HOPED

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:48.776
AND EXPECTED WOULD HAPPEN WHEN

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:50.311
WE ENACTED OUR OWN EMERGENCY

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:52.313
REMOTE ROLES BUT WE'VE IN FACT

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:54.849
FOUND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:55.583
WERE NOT ORIGINALLY

01:35:55.649 --> 01:35:58.085
CONTEMPLATED. FOR EXAMPLE IN

RESTRAINING ORDER CALENDARS WE

01:36:05.092 --> 01:36:06.861
FOUND THAT REMOTE APPEARANCES

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:09.830
ACTUALLY DECREASE THE TENSION

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:12.566
LEVELS IN THOSE COURTS. BY NOT

01:36:12.633 --> 01:36:13.801
HAVING TO SIT ACROSS THE TABLE

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.803
FROM SOMEBODY WHO YEAR IN IT D.

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:18.405
BATTLE WITH. THAT TENSION IS

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:19.707
REDUCED SUCH THAT REMOTE

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.442
APPEARANCES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.344
ABLE TO FACILITATE SETTLEMENT

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:26.380
AND DIFFERENT CASE AND ISSUE

RESOLUTION OPPORTUNITY. IN

01:36:27.681 --> 01:36:29.150
OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS WE'VE

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.384
ALSO SEEN THE BENEFITS OF

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.353
REMOTE APPEARANCES FOR EXAMPLE

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.388
IN CERTAIN JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:40.494
TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONTINUUM OF

01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:43.330
CARE. THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVELY

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:45.933

ADDITIONAL CARE OPPORTUNITIES.

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:59.914
IN ADDITION. JURORS LIKE OUR

OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE POOL

01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.388

WITH OUR COURTS IT ADDRESSES

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.091
THE NEEDS OF THOSE THAT MIGHT

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:12.860
HAVE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES OR

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.395
CERTAIN HEALTH OR HOME

01:37:14.461 --> 01:37:15.329
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NEED TO BE

01:37:15.396 --> 01:37:16.964
DEALT WITH POTENTIALLY

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:18.866
BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THOSE

01:37:21.135 --> 01:37:23.537
SYSTEM AS JURORS. IN ADDITION

OPPORTUNITY TO SEE AND HEAR THE

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:29.710
EVIDENCE THE SAME WAY SOMETHING

01:37:29.777 --> 01:37:33.447
THAT OUR OLD COURTHOUSES DO NOT

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:36.016
NECESSARILY AFFORD. THE REMOTE

01:37:36.083 --> 01:37:37.851
APPEARANCES HAVE BEEN SUCH A

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:39.286
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN ALAMEDA

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:42.056
COUNTY. THAT HAS RECENTLY AS

01:37:42.122 --> 01:37:44.625
JUST LAST MONTH ON FEBRUARY

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:46.427
EIGHT WE ENACTED A NON

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:48.596
EMERGENCY LOCAL RULES TO

01:37:48.662 --> 01:37:50.064
PROMOTE THE CONTINUANCE OF

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.498
REMOTE APPEARANCES EVEN POST

01:37:51.565 --> 01:37:53.901
PANDEMIC AS CONSISTENT WITH THE

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:56.337
LAW. AND THAT'S JUST ONE REASON

01:37:56.403 --> 01:37:58.138
WHY WE SUPPORT THIS TRAILER

01:37:58.205 --> 01:38:01.108
LANGUAGE. AS WE KNOW AND AS HAS

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:02.276
BEEN REFERRED TO AT THIS YEAR

01:38:02.343 --> 01:38:04.078
AND SO FAR THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:06.146
OFTEN SLOW IN PARTICULAR THE

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:09.483
COURTS AND NOT QUICK TO ADJUST.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.118
THE PANDEMIC HAS FORCED OUR

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:14.255
RAPID MOVEMENT IN ALL

01:38:14.321 --> 01:38:14.888
DIRECTIONS THAT WE DID NOT

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:17.224
ANTICIPATE. BUT SOME OF THIS

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.993
MOVEMENT HAS BEEN FOR THE CUT.

01:38:19.059 --> 01:38:20.561
AND THAT IS WITH REMOTE

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:22.496
APPEARANCE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:24.265
TO DO IS CARRY THIS POSITIVE

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:26.467
MOMENTUM FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:29.370
CONTINUE TO SERVE ALL OF THE

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.438
RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AS

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:35.009
EFFICIENTLY. AND EFFECTIVELY AS

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:36.610
POSSIBLE THE TRAILER

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.379
LEGISLATION WOULD ENABLE THAT

01:38:38.445 --> 01:38:40.047
TO HAPPEN WITH OUT CREATING A

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.216
GAP. WITHOUT CREATING THE

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:44.351
OPPORTUNITY FOR A PAUSE FOR A

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:46.987
STOP BACK THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY

01:38:47.054 --> 01:38:49.757
UNDERMINE THE GREAT PROGRESS

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:50.891
THAT WE'VE MADE SO FAR. THANK

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.393

01:38:52.459 --> 01:38:53.994

01:39:34.768 --> 01:39:35.736
WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY REMOVE

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:36.970
THE NECESSITY FOR A PILOT

01:39:37.037 --> 01:39:38.806
PROGRAM TO BE COMPLETED. AGAIN

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:44.545
THIS WILL NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN.

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:45.112
FUTURE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE

01:39:45.179 --> 01:39:46.280
HAVE DONE AROUND. THANK YOU.

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:46.814
THANK YOU LET'S THE LET'S

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.017
ANALYST. I NEED ONLY WITH THE

01:39:50.084 --> 01:39:52.453
L. A. L. ARE UNDERSTANDING OF

01:39:52.519 --> 01:39:53.954
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:55.122
COPY OF OUR HAND OUT BUT IT WAS

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:56.890
POSTED ONLINE ALONG WITH THE

01:39:56.957 --> 01:39:58.158
AGENDA AND IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON

01:39:58.225 --> 01:40:00.594
OUR WEBSITE ON THIS ISSUE- IN

01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:01.628
THE INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE JUST

01:40:01.695 --> 01:40:03.330
GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:05.432
THINGS THAT WILL- HELP

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:07.067
UNDERSTAND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:40:07.134 --> 01:40:08.836
ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE FIRST

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:09.503
THING THAT WE JUST WANT TO

01:40:09.570 --> 01:40:11.739
HIGHLIGHT IS WE VIEW THIS LANDS

01:40:11.805 --> 01:40:12.806
AT THROUGH THE LENS OF

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:14.041
PROVIDING THIS AUTHORITY ON AN

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:15.809
ONGOING BASIS WHICH MEANS AFTER

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:17.111
THE PANDEMIC ENDS AND WE DO

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:19.079
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.614
SITUATION AND USE APPROPRIATE

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.882
USE OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.384
DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT THEN

01:40:23.450 --> 01:40:25.119
ALSO AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO I

01:40:25.185 --> 01:40:25.686
THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THING

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:26.720
THAT WE WANT WANT TO HIGHLIGHT.

01:40:26.787 --> 01:40:27.888
ON BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS WE

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.790
DO THINK THAT THE EXPANSION OF

01:40:29.857 --> 01:40:31.792
REMOTE PROCEEDING IS WARRANTED

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:33.594
BUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS

01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.795
THAT WE HAVE AND SO THE FIRST

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:35.529
THING THAT WE WANTED TO

01:40:35.596 --> 01:40:36.697
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:37.698
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:38.465
CONSIDER WHETHER REMOTE

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:39.433
PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE

01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.034
APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN ALL CASE

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:42.970
TYPES ARE PROCEEDINGS. OR

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:43.871
WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE STATE

01:40:43.937 --> 01:40:45.105
LAW THAT INCLUDES A CERTAIN

01:40:45.172 --> 01:40:47.207
MINIMUM STANDARDS TO ENSURE

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:48.208
THAT COURT USERS ACROSS THE

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:51.111
STATE HAVE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.079
AND SO CURRENTLY THE PROPOSED

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:54.314
LANGUAGE ACCESS SPECIFIC AT

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:55.315
LEAST SIGNIFICANT

01:40:55.382 --> 01:40:57.151
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS TO THE

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:58.652
JUDICIAL BRANCH IF YOU LOOK AT

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.854
OUR HAND OUT ON PAGEFIVE- IT

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.523
LAYS OUT THE KEY QUESTIONS BUT

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:04.191
INCLUDES HOW WOULD COURTS USE

01:41:04.258 --> 01:41:05.159
THE FORTY IS IT GONNA BE

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:06.860
REQUIRED OR OPTIONAL HOW WOULD

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.128
THE COURT PROCESSES CHANGE.

01:41:08.195 --> 01:41:10.464
WOOD FAIRNESS EQUITY PRIVACY IN

01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:11.999
PUBLIC ACCESS ISSUES BE

01:41:12.065 --> 01:41:13.600
ADDRESSED AND IF SO IN WHAT

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.302
MANNER AS A BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:41:15.369 --> 01:41:17.171
HAVE DETAILS ON THESE ON THE

01:41:17.237 --> 01:41:19.206
IMPLEMENTATION IT'S REALLY HARD

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:20.374
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

01:41:20.441 --> 01:41:21.508
IMPACTS ON TRIAL COURT

01:41:21.575 --> 01:41:23.610
OPERATIONS PROCESSES AND COSTS

01:41:23.677 --> 01:41:25.279
WOULD BE AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT

01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:27.514
PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ONLY

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:28.882
A HAND OUT IT LAYS OUT SOME OF

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:31.218
THOSE. KEY IMPACTS SUCH AS YOU

01:41:31.285 --> 01:41:32.219
KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE NET

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.420
IMPACT ON COURT WORKLOAD AND

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:34.588
COST BUT GOING BACK TO

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.522
SOMETHING THAT IS SIMPLY MEMBER

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.324
STONE ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP WHAT

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:38.459
WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON ONGOING

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:41.929
FACILITY- AND SO IN LIGHT OF

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.297
THESE CONCERNS WE DO HAVE TWO

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:44.932
RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:50.871
RECOMMENDATION IS ON PAGE.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:51.371
EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT AND

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:52.439
SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ONE. WE

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:53.140
RECOMMEND THAT THE LET. TO THE

01:41:53.207 --> 01:41:54.107
JUDICIAL BRANCH TO SUBMIT A

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:55.642
DETAILED PLAN. FOR HOW REMOTE.

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.845
WOULD BE AND- BY CASE TYPE AND

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:59.513
WE'RE PROCEEDING TYPE. SO THIS

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.981
PLAN WHICH ADDRESSES SOME OF

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.749
THOSE IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:03.283
WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.886
DETERMINE WHETHER. AND HOW TO

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:07.588
MODIFY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO

01:42:07.654 --> 01:42:09.423
ENSURE THAT. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:11.091
IS USED IN A WAY THAT IS ON THE

01:42:11.158 --> 01:42:11.992
IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:13.660
PRIORITIES SUCH AS YOU KNOW

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:14.928
SETTING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:16.396
EXCLUDING CERTAIN TYPES OF

01:42:16.463 --> 01:42:18.532
PROCEEDINGS. FROM WROTE FROM

01:42:18.599 --> 01:42:21.935
REMOTE- OPERATING REMOTELY. AND

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:22.870
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.137
INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED IN

01:42:24.204 --> 01:42:25.272
THE BUDGET YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:25.339 --> 01:42:27.074
MY SPINAL CORD. BUT IF THEY

01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:30.277
CAN'T THEN IT COULD BE A

01:42:30.344 --> 01:42:30.878
DISCUSSION FOR THE NEXT BUDGET

01:42:30.944 --> 01:42:32.346
HERE. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION

01:42:32.412 --> 01:42:34.014
IS IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

01:42:34.081 --> 01:42:35.482
MOVE FORWARD BEFORE A PLAN IS

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:36.416
RECEIVED AND THIS IS GONNA BE

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:38.118
ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND OUT.

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:39.419
AND UNDER THIS ONE WE WOULD

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:40.621
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:42:40.687 --> 01:42:42.556
PILOT REMOTE PROCEEDINGS FOR

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:44.358
TWO YEARS AND LESS COMPLEX CASE

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.193
TYPES OR PROCEEDINGS. SUCH AS

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.661
INFRACTIONS ARE SMALL CLAIMS

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:49.730
PLACES AND REQUIRING EVALUATION

01:42:49.796 --> 01:42:50.998
BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:53.634
TWO. THIS APPROACH WOULD INFORM

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.035
LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS ON

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:57.271
WHETHER TO EXTEND EXPAND OR

01:42:57.337 --> 01:42:58.939
MODIFY THE AUTHORIZATION ONCE

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:00.841
THE PILOT ENDS. AND THIS WOULD

01:43:00.908 --> 01:43:02.609
ALLOW FOR ANY IMPLEMENTATION

01:43:02.676 --> 01:43:04.311
ISSUES TO BE IDENTIFIED AND

01:43:04.378 --> 01:43:05.646
RESOLVED IN AREAS THAT HAVE

01:43:05.712 --> 01:43:07.447
LESS IMPACT ON COURT USERS

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:10.117
LIVES. BEFORE BEING EXPANDED TO

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.218
MORE COMPLEX CASE TYPES AND

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:12.920
PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.288
THE BENEFIT OF MINIMIZING

01:43:14.354 --> 01:43:15.889
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:19.893
COSTS- IN RELATION TO MR ROMIJN

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.095
COMMENTS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:24.131
USING THAT AS A PILOT. WE DO

01:43:24.197 --> 01:43:25.399
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A

01:43:25.465 --> 01:43:27.034
NUMBER OF LESSONS LEARNT

01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:29.603
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- BUT THE

01:43:29.670 --> 01:43:30.604
KEY THING THAT WE WOULD

01:43:30.671 --> 01:43:32.105
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT INDIVIDUAL

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:33.206
COURTS HAVE HAD DIFFERENT

01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:35.175
EXPERIENCES. BASED ON THEIR

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:36.977
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR LOCAL

01:43:37.044 --> 01:43:38.745
PRIORITIES AND SO I THINK THAT

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:39.947
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.214
WE ARE SAYING THAT IF YOU DON'T

01:43:41.281 --> 01:43:41.748

BETTER SENSE OF HOW. TRIAL

01:43:49.389 --> 01:43:51.058
COURTS GENERALLY ACROSS THE

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:54.695
STATE. WOULD BE IMPACTED. THANK

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.530

NUMBER OF CASE FILINGS DROPPED

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:55.288
BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. THE

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.990
NUMBER OF CASES POSITIONS HAVE

01:44:57.057 --> 01:45:00.327
BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT. 50% IN

TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S ONLY

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.364
BECAUSE OF REMOTE HEARINGS THAT

01:45:04.431 --> 01:45:06.266
THIS NUMBER IS NOT WORSE.

01:45:06.333 --> 01:45:08.068
FUNDING FOR REMOTE HEARINGS

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.536

01:45:12.706 --> 01:45:14.608
YEARS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN.

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:15.942
WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:17.144
CHALLENGES OF REMOTE PROCEEDING

01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.779
SUCH AS FORGETTING TO GO OFF

01:45:18.845 --> 01:45:20.247
MUTE BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

01:45:20.313 --> 01:45:22.215
PUBLIC THAT REMOTE HEARINGS

01:45:22.282 --> 01:45:23.750
PROVIDE EQUITY. IN THE

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:25.752

SPACE ON THE VIDEO SCREEN

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:32.225
RATHER THAN BEING OVERSHADOWED

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:32.659
BY ADULTS IN A LARGE

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.561
COURTHOUSE. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:37.431
ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD

01:45:37.497 --> 01:45:38.799

THIS BACK PHIL- BACK FEELS

01:52:40.854 --> 01:52:42.822
THOSE THOSE REVENUES IT

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.524
DIMINISHED AND INSURES THAT THE

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.526
FORENSIC LAB. HAS THE REVENUE

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.961
NEEDED TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:50.263
OPERATIONS- SO WITH THAT WE

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:53.933

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:59.906
OVERHEAD. I NEED ONLY WITH THE

01:52:59.973 --> 01:53:01.841
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE-

01:53:01.908 --> 01:53:03.676
WE HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS

01:53:03.743 --> 01:53:04.611
RELATED TO THE BUREAU OF

01:53:04.677 --> 01:53:05.945
FORENSIC SERVICES OF THESE ARE

01:53:06.012 --> 01:53:07.680
ITEMS THREE AND FOUR ON YOUR

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:09.916
AGENDA WILL START WITH- ITEM

01:53:09.983 --> 01:53:12.952
FOR WHICH IS THE BACK FELT- WE

01:53:13.019 --> 01:53:13.419
RECOMMENDED THAT THE

01:53:13.486 --> 01:53:15.455
LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:18.057
BACKFILL BUT ONLY FOR TWO YEARS

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:19.192
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:20.593
ARE SUFFICIENT REVENUES AND THE

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.061
FINGERPRINT FEES ACCOUNT WHICH

01:53:22.128 --> 01:53:23.329
IS USED WHICH IS BEING USED TO

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:25.131
BACKFILL- A PORTION OF THE

01:53:25.198 --> 01:53:26.399
FUNDS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:28.735
PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU- AND

01:53:28.801 --> 01:53:30.203
THIS IS BECAUSE THE REVENUES

01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:33.206
HAVE BEEN LOWER. THAN IN TWO

01:53:33.273 --> 01:53:33.806
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND

01:53:33.873 --> 01:53:34.307
THE FUNDS COULD BECOME

01:53:34.374 --> 01:53:36.075
INSOLVENT IN A COUPLE YEARS OF

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:36.876
THE REVENUES DO NOT

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:41.214
SUFFICIENTLY INCREASE ON THIS

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:42.348
TWO YEARS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE.

01:53:42.415 --> 01:53:43.917
THE BUREAU WITH FUNDING WALL

01:53:43.983 --> 01:53:45.084
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:46.819
FUNDING FRAMEWORK ARE BEING

01:53:46.886 --> 01:53:48.788
IMPLEMENTED. SO MY LOOK AT OUR

01:53:48.855 --> 01:53:50.023
SECOND RECOMMENDATION FOR THE

01:53:50.089 --> 01:53:51.558
LEGISLATURE IS TO IMPLEMENT A

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.593
NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK- TO

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.094
REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO

01:53:55.161 --> 01:53:56.596
PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU OF

01:53:56.663 --> 01:53:59.232
FORENSIC SERVICES BEGINNING IN

01:53:59.299 --> 01:53:59.766
TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:01.134
FOUR. AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.502
THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT THAT

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:04.571
CERTAIN LOCAL AGENCIES AND

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:05.305
FORTY SIX COUNTIES ARE

01:54:05.371 --> 01:54:07.407
RECEIVING FROM THE BUREAU-

01:54:07.473 --> 01:54:10.376
WHICH IS PROVIDING SERVICES TO

01:54:10.443 --> 01:54:10.910
THOSE LOCAL AGENCIES AT NO

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.812
CHARGE. AND SO REQUIRING THAT

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:14.480
LOCAL AGENCIES CONTRIBUTE TO

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:17.817
PAY A PORTION. OF THE COST TO

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:18.851
SUPPORT THE BUREAU COULD

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:20.253
PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVE FOR

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.921
THEM TO PRIORITIZE THE WORK

01:54:21.988 --> 01:54:23.489
THAT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO DOJ

01:54:23.556 --> 01:54:25.458
AND REDUCE THE AN ONGOING NEED

01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:27.727
FOR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT- SO

01:54:27.794 --> 01:54:28.695
CURRENTLY THE SUBMISSIONS ARE

01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:30.530
REALLY ONLY LIMITED BY DOJ'S

01:54:30.597 --> 01:54:32.065
OVERALL CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL

01:54:32.131 --> 01:54:33.666
OF FUNDING THAT THE STATE

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:34.400
PROVIDES TO THE SUPPORT THE

01:54:34.467 --> 01:54:36.169
BUREAU. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:37.670
THOSE TWELVE COUNTIES IN EIGHT

01:54:37.737 --> 01:54:38.805
CITIES THAT ARE OPERATING THEIR

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:41.741
OWN LABS ARE CURRENTLY SERVE

01:54:41.808 --> 01:54:43.509
PRIORITIZING. THEIR WORKLOAD.

01:54:43.576 --> 01:54:44.978
OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION- YOU

01:54:45.044 --> 01:54:46.379
KNOW TO HELP WITH THIS FUNDING

01:54:46.446 --> 01:54:47.614
FOR MARK IS THAT WE RECOMMEND

01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.881
THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE

01:54:48.948 --> 01:54:50.984
DOJ DEVELOP AND REPORT ON A

01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:53.219
PLAN NO LATER THAN OCTOBER OF

01:54:53.286 --> 01:54:53.886
TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOR

01:54:53.953 --> 01:54:57.890
CALCULATING EACH LOCAL AGENCIES

01:54:57.957 --> 01:54:59.425
AND SERVICE PROVIDES DOJ WITH

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.860
THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK WITH

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:03.997
STAKEHOLDERS. TO DETERMINE WHAT

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:05.231
THE SPECIFICS OF THAT FUNDING

01:55:05.298 --> 01:55:06.466
FROM WORK WOULD LOOK LIKE SO

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:08.201
SHOULD THERE BE A DIFFERENCE IN

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:09.802
SHARE BASED ON THE TYPE OF

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.504
FORENSIC SERVICE. BEING USED

01:55:11.571 --> 01:55:13.106
THE SPEED OF THE SERVICE OR THE

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:17.210
TECH- OR SIZE OF THE AGENCY. I

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.512
IN LINE IS THAT IT REALLY ITEMS

01:55:19.579 --> 01:55:21.247
OF YOURS ON THE CONSOLE.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:22.949
FACILITY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:24.217
LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS

01:55:24.284 --> 01:55:25.518
PROPOSAL UNTIL THE NEW FUNDING

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:27.487
FRAMEWORK IS IMPLEMENTED. AND

01:55:27.553 --> 01:55:28.254
THIS IS BECAUSE THE NEW FUNDING

01:55:28.321 --> 01:55:29.555
FROM WORK WOULD PROVIDE GREATER

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:32.258
INCENTIVE FOR- ENTITIES TO FIND

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:33.826
THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF

01:55:33.893 --> 01:55:35.595
OBTAINING LABORATORY SERVICES

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.530
AND THAT COULD CHANGE THE NEED.

01:55:37.597 --> 01:55:40.300
FOR THE FACILITY AND IN THE

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:44.837
FUTURE. THANK YOU. COMMENTS BY

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:47.907

01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:51.511
SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE DNA

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:53.079
IDENTIFICATION AND FIND THE

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:55.081
BACK FELL OBVIOUSLY WE PUT THAT

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:56.549
COVERS BUDGET INCLUDES ON GOING

01:55:56.616 --> 01:55:58.418
FUNDING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:55:58.484 --> 01:55:59.719
TO NOTE THAT IS AN ONGOING

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.020
ISSUE WE PUT IN ONE TIME

01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:03.122
FUNDING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.791
ALSO ALTHOUGH THAT FUNDING IS

01:56:04.857 --> 01:56:06.259
ON GOING IT WILL IT'LL BE

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:07.327
ADJUSTED EACH YEAR THROUGH THE

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:08.728
BUDGET PROCESS BASED ON ACTUAL

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:10.763
REVENUES EXPENDITURES. AND THEN

01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.098

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:13.466
RECOMMENDATION TO POTENTIALLY

OF YOUR FORENSIC SERVICES COSTS

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:17.970
I THINK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.906
ABOUT THAT- BECAUSE THE WORD

01:56:19.972 --> 01:56:21.341
ABOUT SMALLER COUNTY THAT THEY

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.643
CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR SOME

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.078
SERVICES THEY MAY HAVE TO-

01:56:25.144 --> 01:56:26.646
UNFORTUNATE PRIORITIZED BY

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:14.894
DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WOULD

01:57:14.961 --> 01:57:17.864
COST- AND IS THE DOJ OPEN TO

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.632

JUSTICE INVOLVED- RBC P. AS I

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:03.901
MENTIONED AT HAS A SLIGHTLY

02:34:03.968 --> 02:34:05.669
DIFFERENT- INTERPRETATION OF

02:34:05.736 --> 02:34:07.371
THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICE OF THE-

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:11.942
PERSON- AND THAT'S- AND- WE'VE

02:34:12.009 --> 02:34:14.111
ACTUALLY SEEN MULTIPLE STAFF

02:34:14.178 --> 02:34:15.412
PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT I KNOW

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:16.880
THERE WAS A MENTION THAT THERE

02:34:16.947 --> 02:34:18.248
WERE TWO STAFF THAT WERE.

02:34:18.315 --> 02:34:19.917
DEDICATED TO THAT POSITION BUT

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:21.919
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WE'VE

02:34:21.986 --> 02:34:24.221
ORGANIZED OUR ORG CHART INTO

02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:25.990
UNITS THAT REPORT TO AN

02:34:26.056 --> 02:34:28.525
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF WHICH OF

02:34:28.592 --> 02:34:29.259
COURSE IS WHERE WE'LL HAVE OUR

02:34:29.326 --> 02:34:30.661
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS

02:34:30.728 --> 02:34:32.730

02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:34.098
ENVISIONED TO PEOPLE BEING

02:34:34.164 --> 02:34:35.866
FULLY DEDICATE TO RECEIVING

02:34:35.933 --> 02:34:37.768
THOSE BUT IT REALLY WILL BE THE

02:34:37.835 --> 02:34:38.836
WORK OF THE OFFICE TO

02:34:38.902 --> 02:34:43.540
DETERMINE- OUT TO ASSESS REFER-

02:34:43.607 --> 02:34:45.109
IN MANY CASES THEY WILL BE

02:34:45.175 --> 02:34:46.410
GOING BACK LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE

02:34:46.477 --> 02:34:47.011
FACILITIES AND THE

02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:49.346
ADMINISTRATORS AND TRYING TO

02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:53.617
RESOLVE THE ISSUE LOCALLY.

02:34:53.684 --> 02:34:54.251
BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL YOU KNOW

02:34:54.318 --> 02:34:54.752
THAT WE WANT. OUR COUNTY

02:34:54.818 --> 02:34:56.387
IMPLEMENT TO BE. AND THAT IS

02:34:56.453 --> 02:34:58.055
REALLY OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AT

02:34:58.122 --> 02:34:59.590
THIS TIME THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:34:59.657 --> 02:35:01.725
CHANGE SHIFT IN POLICY. UP FOR

02:35:01.792 --> 02:35:03.093

LONGER BE REFERRED TO THE

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.864
DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:35:06.930 --> 02:35:08.832
WHICH CURRENTLY SERVES AROUND

02:35:08.899 --> 02:35:10.300
SEVEN HUNDRED USE. AND WE NEED

02:35:10.367 --> 02:35:13.137
TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE USE OF

OPTION IN THE FUTURE HAVE THE

02:35:19.343 --> 02:35:20.978
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED AT THE

02:35:22.379 --> 02:35:23.547
LOCAL LEVEL AND SO THAT'S

02:35:23.614 --> 02:35:25.449
REALLY OUR LASER FOCUS. AT THIS

02:35:25.516 --> 02:35:27.885

THIS AREA I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:38.328
IMPORTANT TO COORDINATE THAT

02:35:38.395 --> 02:35:39.296

LEGISLATURE THAT MESSED IT UP

02:37:09.153 --> 02:37:10.621

02:41:34.084 --> 02:41:36.119
THE SCOPE I THINK OF YOUR

02:41:36.186 --> 02:41:37.554
ORGANIZATION IS SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:40.991
AND WE ALL THINK IT NEEDS TO BE

02:41:41.058 --> 02:41:43.627
MORE OF US HERE AND WHEN YOU

02:41:43.693 --> 02:41:46.163
LOOK AT THE TASK AHEAD N.

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:49.099
WHAT'S BEING ASKED IS. IT'S NOT

02:41:49.166 --> 02:41:50.434
JUST WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S

02:41:50.500 --> 02:41:52.669
BECAUSE- NOT EVERY COUNTY WILL

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:55.205
BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:57.174
THE SERVICES FOR THOSE KIDS.

02:41:57.240 --> 02:41:58.809
SOME HAVE TO BE DONE REGIONALLY

02:41:58.875 --> 02:42:00.110
ACCREDITED HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

02:42:00.177 --> 02:42:02.145
HOW TO WORK TOGETHER. THERE ARE

02:42:02.212 --> 02:42:03.680
A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS THAT

02:42:03.747 --> 02:42:05.649
NEED TO BE RAISED. AND WILL

02:42:05.715 --> 02:42:07.417
NEED SOME SIGNIFICANT GUIDANCE

02:42:07.484 --> 02:42:09.252
FROM THE STATE AB HELPED IN

02:42:09.319 --> 02:42:10.353
PUTTING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:12.322
TOGETHER. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE

02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:13.924
SURE AND THEN EVEN JUST DEALING

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:16.126
WITH IN YOUR OWN AGENCY. AS WE

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:17.861
SAW WITH CC ARE THE CONTINUING

02:42:17.928 --> 02:42:21.465
CARE REFORM. GETTING D. HUMAN

02:42:21.531 --> 02:42:22.399
SERVICES SIDE ESPECIALLY

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:24.668
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKING WITH

02:42:24.734 --> 02:42:26.770
THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE THE

02:42:26.837 --> 02:42:28.839
HUMAN SERVICES SIDE WAS NOT

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:30.607
VERY EASY TO DO BECAUSE THEY

02:42:30.674 --> 02:42:31.842
WERE SO VERY DIFFERENT

02:42:31.908 --> 02:42:33.443
PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT THE

02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:36.480
MISSIONS WERE AND WHAT. THE

02:42:36.546 --> 02:42:38.014
SENSE OF OUTCOMES WERE GOING TO

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:40.016
BE SO I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE

02:42:40.083 --> 02:42:42.452
COMPLEX TO DO AND AS SOON AS

02:42:42.519 --> 02:42:44.588
YOU START TASKING THOSE OTHER.

02:42:44.654 --> 02:42:46.523
YOUR SOURCE SISTER AGENCIES

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:48.258
WITHIN HHS THEY'RE THEY'RE

02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:49.893
GONNA BE LOOKING FOR MONEY AND

02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:50.961
MAYBE THAT'S COMES OUT OF A

02:42:51.027 --> 02:42:51.862
DIFFERENT BUDGET SO MAYBE WE'RE

02:42:51.928 --> 02:42:53.763
NOT SEEING THOSE. THOSE THOSE

02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:55.732
REQUESTS COME UP. BUT FOR ME

02:42:55.799 --> 02:42:57.767

BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND IF

02:43:02.639 --> 02:43:05.041
IT'S A QUESTION ABOUT. SCOPE

02:43:05.108 --> 02:43:07.210
AND HOW MUCH AUTHORITY YOU HAVE

02:43:07.277 --> 02:43:08.845
VERSUS WHAT WE THINK YOU SHOULD

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:09.880

ABOUT HOW AGES- HEALTH AND

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:51.114
HUMAN SERVICES AND THE

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAME UP

02:44:52.649 --> 02:44:55.151
WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND

02:44:55.218 --> 02:44:56.786
CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:44:56.853 --> 02:44:58.822
WE'RE FINDING IT AT A- PROPER

02:44:58.888 --> 02:45:01.358
LEVEL. OF MOST OF OUR HEARINGS

02:45:01.424 --> 02:45:03.927
HAVE BEEN ABOUT- WHY ASKING US

02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:04.995
FOR SO MUCH MONEY AND THINK

02:45:05.061 --> 02:45:07.497
THAT THEY WERE ASKING WHY ARE

02:45:07.564 --> 02:45:08.098
YOU ASKING THIS FOR SO LITTLE

02:45:08.164 --> 02:45:09.766
MONEY. WHICH IS THE RARE

02:45:09.833 --> 02:45:12.402
POSITION TO BE IN- AS I DO WANT

02:45:12.469 --> 02:45:16.473
TO. POINT THAT OUT- AND SO WITH

02:45:16.539 --> 02:45:17.774
THAT I GUESS IT DID TRY TO

02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:19.276
CLARIFY SOME SOME OF THAT

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:21.311
CONFUSION TO HEALTH AND HUMAN

02:45:21.378 --> 02:45:23.947
SERVICES. THAT CAN YOU CONFIRM

02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:25.148
THAT YOU TOLD YOUR STAFF AT THE

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:26.750
BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE OFFICE

02:45:26.816 --> 02:45:29.886
WAS CREATED WITH. I'LL JUST

02:45:29.953 --> 02:45:30.954
HAVE AN AFFAIR. WITH AN ARAB.

02:45:31.021 --> 02:45:38.395
OF ONLY DJJ YOUTH. THEY'RE NOT

02:45:38.461 --> 02:45:39.529
ACTIVELY UNDERSTOOD THE

02:45:39.596 --> 02:45:42.599
QUESTION BUT- HE THERE ARE

02:45:42.666 --> 02:45:44.801
DIFFERENT- FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE

02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:46.236
OFFICE I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF

02:45:46.303 --> 02:45:48.805
OUR POLICY ROLES AND IN TERMS

02:45:48.872 --> 02:45:49.939
OF PROMOTING AND DISSEMINATING

02:45:50.006 --> 02:45:52.709
BEST PRACTICES. AND THAT IS

02:45:52.776 --> 02:45:53.243
VERY CLEARLY OUTLINED IN

02:45:53.310 --> 02:45:55.979
STATUTE TO BE FOR THE BROADER

02:45:56.046 --> 02:45:58.181
LARGER SYSTEM AND ALL USED IT

02:45:58.248 --> 02:46:00.483
MAYBE JUSTICE INVOLVED BUT FOR

02:46:00.550 --> 02:46:02.018
THIS PECIFIC ROLES AROUND THE

02:46:02.085 --> 02:46:03.420
HONEST PERSON AND THAT

02:46:03.486 --> 02:46:05.588
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND

02:46:05.655 --> 02:46:06.956
THAT THAT IS VERY NARROWLY

02:46:07.023 --> 02:46:10.794
FOCUSED- IN OUR BELIEF ON THE

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:13.063
RELAUNCH POPULATION. ASKING

02:46:13.129 --> 02:46:16.232
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. I

02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:17.600
THINK THAT FIRST TO ANSWER OUR

02:46:17.667 --> 02:46:19.602
QUESTION AND SO GIVEN THAT YOU

02:46:19.669 --> 02:46:21.471
ARE NOT LETTING US KNOW THAT

02:46:21.538 --> 02:46:24.040
YOU DO THINK THAT IT'S WIDER AT

02:46:24.107 --> 02:46:25.575
THINK AGAIN THAT THE DOLLAR

02:46:25.642 --> 02:46:27.577
MONTH STILL SEEMS QUESTIONABLE

02:46:27.644 --> 02:46:28.878
AND SO I WOULD THINK THAT THAT

02:46:28.945 --> 02:46:30.213
THE COMMITTEES REQUESTING AN

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.317
UPDATED B. C. P. THAT'S BASED

02:46:34.384 --> 02:46:34.918
ON THE DUTIES ARE LAID OUT IN

02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:37.587
THE STATUTE- EARLIER YOU SAID

02:46:37.654 --> 02:46:38.455
THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT WHICH YOU

02:46:38.521 --> 02:46:44.694
SUBMIT IT WITH. THAT YOU KNOW

02:46:44.761 --> 02:46:46.129
WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE

02:46:46.196 --> 02:46:46.930
WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO COME UP

02:46:46.996 --> 02:46:49.666
WITH SOMETHING THAT. INK MAYBE

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:51.034
FITS OUR INTERPRETATION IS

02:46:51.101 --> 02:46:54.371
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:55.705
THIS IS ALLISON YOUR DEPARTMENT

02:46:55.772 --> 02:46:57.674
OF FINANCE IF I MAY ADD ON TO

02:46:57.741 --> 02:46:59.943
MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS VERY

02:47:00.009 --> 02:47:01.745
QUICKLY SO. THIS IS WHAT THE

02:47:01.811 --> 02:47:03.513
ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:05.648
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE THINK HOW.

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:08.318
WE WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL TAKE.

02:47:08.385 --> 02:47:09.686
IT WILL TAKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL

02:47:09.753 --> 02:47:10.553
IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:12.522
IMPLEMENTING THE SAME OFFICE I

02:47:12.589 --> 02:47:13.523
THINK WE CAN SAY THAT THERE'S A

02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:15.191
FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT

02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:16.593
HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS

02:47:16.659 --> 02:47:18.428
INTERPRETING THE STATUTE BUT WE

02:47:18.495 --> 02:47:19.929
REALLY SAW THE OFFICES AS

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:21.464
HAVING TO CORPS OVERSIGHT

02:47:21.531 --> 02:47:22.966
COMPONENTS. AND I WOULD HAVE MY

02:47:23.032 --> 02:47:24.434
COLLEAGUE FILL IN ANY GAPS THAT

02:47:24.501 --> 02:47:26.736
I MISS UN BUT WE SEE IT ALL

02:47:26.803 --> 02:47:28.772
RIGHT- REVIEW OF THE PLANS AS

02:47:28.838 --> 02:47:30.774
IT PERTAINS TO THAT I SIX

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:31.608
HUNDRED AND NINETY YOUTH THAT

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:33.443
ARE CURRENTLY HOUSING DJ THAT

02:47:33.510 --> 02:47:34.310
WOULD BE REALIGNED TO THE

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:36.746
COUNTY IS. AND THE REALIGNMENT

02:47:36.813 --> 02:47:37.313
OF THE CRANE STARTING JULY

02:47:37.380 --> 02:47:40.116
FIRST FINE AND THEN WE SEE AT

02:47:40.183 --> 02:47:41.317
THE PRINCE OF THE OFFICE OF THE

02:47:41.384 --> 02:47:43.787
OMBUDSPERSON THAT'S- THE WHOLE

02:47:43.853 --> 02:47:45.455
GOAL HERE OF THE REALIGNMENT

02:47:45.522 --> 02:47:46.856
AND PUTTING THE YOUTH BACK AT

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:48.625
THE COUNTIES IS BECAUSE WE SEE

02:47:48.691 --> 02:47:50.326
MORE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. AND

02:47:50.393 --> 02:47:51.528
SO WHEN THERE'S A CORE BELIEF

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:53.029
THAT THE COUNTY IS I IN

02:47:53.096 --> 02:47:53.897
ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THAT'S

02:47:53.963 --> 02:47:56.433
BEEN APPROPRIATED WOULD BE ABLE

02:47:56.499 --> 02:47:59.035
TO SERVE THESE YOUTH AND HAVE

02:47:59.102 --> 02:48:00.637
BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SERVING

YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY. AND SO.

02:48:02.739 --> 02:48:03.940
THAT'S I THINK WHERE WHERE

THERE'S A I NEED A DISAGREEMENT

02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:07.110
IS WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE

02:48:07.177 --> 02:48:08.244
OMBUDSPERSON FROM OUR

02:48:08.311 --> 02:48:10.447
PERSPECTIVE THE VISION HERE IS

02:48:10.513 --> 02:48:13.016
THAT. AND THEY OMBUDSPERSON IS

02:48:13.082 --> 02:48:14.684

YOU THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDS

02:48:16.219 --> 02:48:18.087
WHICH ARE THAT THE REAL LINES

02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:20.490
POPULATIONS. AND INCLUDING THE

02:48:20.557 --> 02:48:21.691
POPULATION THAT WOULD BE

02:48:21.758 --> 02:48:23.760
REALIGNED UNDER SB EIGHT TO

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:25.428
THREE AND IF THEY WERE TO GET

02:48:33.903 --> 02:48:34.671
WHETHER IT'S AT THE COUNTY

02:48:34.737 --> 02:48:36.072

CAN HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS

02:48:36.973 --> 02:48:38.475
ADDRESSED. I THINK THE QUESTION

02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:39.976
IS WHAT DOES THE OMBUDSPERSON

02:48:40.043 --> 02:48:42.445
DO WITHIN THE OFFICE AND THAT

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:43.146
THE FOCUS THERE AND THE

02:48:43.213 --> 02:48:44.848
INTENTIONAL. FOCUS OF THE

02:48:44.914 --> 02:48:46.483
ADMINISTRATION WAS ON THE REAL

02:48:46.549 --> 02:48:48.518

CONNECTING THEM TO THE

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:56.125

02:48:56.192 --> 02:48:57.594
ABLE TO HELP THEM IN TERMS OF

02:48:57.660 --> 02:49:04.267
ANY COMPLAINTS THAT ARISE. I

02:49:04.334 --> 02:49:04.801
JUST WANTED TO ADD IN THAT

02:49:04.868 --> 02:49:05.368

GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AND

02:49:13.543 --> 02:49:14.978
THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT

02:49:15.044 --> 02:49:16.446
VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

02:49:16.513 --> 02:49:19.516
WE HAVE OTHER HONEST PERSONS-

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:21.918
CERTAINLY AGAIN YOU KNOW. IF

02:49:21.985 --> 02:49:23.720
ANYTHING AGREE JUST A LEGAL YOU

02:49:23.786 --> 02:49:25.288

02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:36.466
FOCUSED ON THESE KIDS THESE ARE

02:49:36.533 --> 02:49:37.634
THE KIDS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY

02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:39.469

02:49:45.608 --> 02:49:47.477

02:49:47.544 --> 02:49:49.379

LANDREAU WHY DOES INTERPRET

02:50:15.672 --> 02:50:17.273
INTERPRETATIONS WERE MADE WHEN

ALL THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS HAVE

02:50:18.708 --> 02:50:20.443
A CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:50:20.510 --> 02:50:22.211
LEGISLATURE WHO. HAD ANY

02:50:22.278 --> 02:50:23.446
INTENTION WHEN THEY DRAFTED

02:50:23.513 --> 02:50:25.081

WE HAVE AND IT IS CLEAR AND

WORK AND WE'RE TELLING THEM HE

02:50:28.351 --> 02:50:29.786
ATTENTION WAS THAT THIS BE A

02:50:29.852 --> 02:50:31.955
ROBUST OFFICE WITH A LOT OF

02:50:32.021 --> 02:50:33.723
RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE A LOT

02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:34.290
OF THAT STATE WE'RE TALKING

02:50:34.357 --> 02:50:36.659

02:50:37.994 --> 02:50:39.662
OUR STATE AND IF WE HAVE AN

02:50:39.729 --> 02:50:41.798
UNDERFUNDED OVERSIGHT ENTITY

02:50:41.864 --> 02:50:43.633
WITH A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES

02:50:43.700 --> 02:50:47.270
THINGS ARE GOING TO GO WRONG

02:50:47.337 --> 02:50:48.004

02:50:48.071 --> 02:50:49.439
PEOPLE WILL BE KILLED RIGHT AND

02:50:49.505 --> 02:50:51.574
SO FOR PEOPLE TO SUGGEST. THAT

APPROPRIATE PEOPLE TO GET A

02:50:56.179 --> 02:50:57.447
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

02:50:57.513 --> 02:50:59.582
THIS LOG OUT. IT'S JUST WRONG I

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:00.083
THINK IT SHOWS A LACK OF

02:51:00.149 --> 02:51:01.584
COMMUNITY IN A LACK OF.

02:51:01.651 --> 02:51:03.653
ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED TO GET

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:04.721
THIS RIGHT EQUITIES JONES

02:51:04.787 --> 02:51:06.623
SAWYER SAID AND SO I THINK WE

02:51:06.689 --> 02:51:08.992
DO NEED TO MAYBE. GO BACK TO

02:51:09.058 --> 02:51:10.960

MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE NARROWING

02:51:20.069 --> 02:51:21.938
THE SCOPE. OF WHAT WE THINK

02:51:22.005 --> 02:51:23.473
THIS STATUTES SAID WHEN THAT IN

02:51:23.539 --> 02:51:25.642
FACT NOT THE REALITY. IS

02:51:25.708 --> 02:51:27.110
DISRESPECTFUL TO THE KIDS WHO

02:51:27.176 --> 02:51:28.878
