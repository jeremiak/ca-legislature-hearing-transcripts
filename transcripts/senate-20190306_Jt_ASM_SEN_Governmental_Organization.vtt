RECENT YEARS.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:34.419
A THOROUGH ASSESSMENT OF WHAT

THE FIRE RESPONSE.

00:22:35.921 --> 00:22:38.356

AND AND WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND AS

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:45.597
WE THINKING ABOUT ADDING

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.202
AND THERE IS A COUPLE HUNDRED

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.504
MILLION I'M IN THE CURRENT YEAR

00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:53.538
THREE LIKELY THEY'LL BE MORE

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:55.974
RESOURCES AND PROPOSED IN FUTURE

00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.609
YEARS TO CONTINUE ADDING.

00:22:57.676 --> 00:22:59.311
AN EQUIPMENT AND STAFFING TO

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:00.946
RESPOND TO FIRES ON IS THAT WE

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:02.714
THINK THAT HAVING AN ASSESSMENT

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:03.815
OF REALLY WHERE WE ADDED A

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.517
RESPONSE CAPACITY --

00:23:05.584 --> 00:23:07.185
WHERE THOSE GAPS AND THEN HOW WE

00:23:07.252 --> 00:23:08.720
SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING AN

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:09.988
INCREASE OF RESOURCES WOULD BE

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:11.490
VERY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:13.925
IN FUTURE YEARS TO PLAN FOR

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:14.926
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:15.961
BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK AND

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.435
RESOURCES.

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:24.002
SO IN AYE RECOMMENDATION WE

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:24.936
THINK THAT AND THIS ASSESSMENT

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:26.071
SHOULD EVALUATE ALL TYPES OF

00:23:26.138 --> 00:23:27.806
FIRE RESPONSE RESOURCES AND WE

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:28.740
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THAT COULD

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:30.542
INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY THERE'S NO

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:31.777
REASON THAT THAT SHOULDN'T

00:23:31.843 --> 00:23:33.445
INCLUDE TECHNOLOGY --

00:23:33.512 --> 00:23:35.914
AND SO YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

00:23:35.981 --> 00:23:36.414
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:39.751

THIS ASSESSED ALL IT SHOULD AND

00:23:46.158 --> 00:23:47.759
THEY TAKE IN LOOKING AT

00:23:47.826 --> 00:23:49.161
TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT ROLE SHOULD

00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:50.428
TECHNOLOGY PLAY.

00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:54.199
IN HOW WE RESPONDED TO FIRES AND

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.767
IS THERE A WAY TO BE YOU KNOW

00:23:55.834 --> 00:23:56.902
MORE COST EFFECTIVE BY USING

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:58.737
TECHNOLOGY AND AND HOW DOES THAT

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:00.205
FIT IN WITH THE MORE TRADITIONAL

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.439
FIRE RESPONSE.

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.275
I'M STRATEGIES THAT THE STATE

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:05.377
USES I'M AND I CAN BE ONE WAY OF

00:24:05.443 --> 00:24:06.444
ENSURING THAT WHATEVER

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.013
ASSESSMENT THEY PUT FORWARD IS

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.048
SOMETHING THAT'S FUTURE LOOKING

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.817
AND REFLECTS SORT OF A

00:24:11.883 --> 00:24:14.085
MODERNIZED APPROACH.

00:24:14.152 --> 00:24:15.520
TO HOW THE STATE FIGHTS FIRES.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:16.955
AND SO I WILL JUST LEAVE MY

00:24:17.022 --> 00:24:18.523
COMMENTS THERE AND HAPPY TO

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.858

NOW OR AFTER THE DIRECTORS MAKE

00:24:22.527 --> 00:24:27.065
THEIR PRESENTATIONS.

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:27.666
THE COOL WAY TO THE END OF THE

NINE ONE ONE IS IS --

00:25:41.973 --> 00:25:45.610
THE CELLULAR BASE AND THE PLACE

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.812
WHERE SOMEBODY ON A NINE ONE ONE

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:49.848
CALL ON A CELLULAR SYSTEM IS NOT

00:25:49.915 --> 00:25:51.149
NECESSARILY.

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:53.084
EVEN ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE THE

IT NOW THAT'S NOT REALLY THE

00:26:07.332 --> 00:26:09.367
CASE AND SO IT TAKES IT TAKES US

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:11.169
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO IDENTIFY

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:12.704
EXACTLY WHERE --

00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:14.806

THE DIFFERENT DEVICES TO

00:26:30.388 --> 00:26:31.990
IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHERE THAT FIRE

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:33.525
IS IT'S ACTUALLY MORE PRECISE

00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:35.427
THAN THAN --

00:26:35.493 --> 00:26:37.062
NINE ONE ONE CALLER BUT IT'S

MEN -- THE

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.512
THE HUNDRED CAMERAS THAT ARE

00:26:54.579 --> 00:26:56.414
THAT ARE ON THE IN THE PROPOSED

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:59.150
BUDGET BUT WHAT THOSE ARE HE IS

00:26:59.217 --> 00:27:01.486
RIGHT NOW VERY MUCH A SITUATION

00:27:01.553 --> 00:27:04.022
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOL --

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:05.557
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE USE FOR

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.459
VALIDATION AND THAT THERE IS

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:09.494
TRULY A FIRE IN AN AREA --

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:12.063

WE LAUNCH THE RESOURCES AND THEN

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:25.910
WE TURN TO THE CAMERAS AND TAKE

00:27:25.977 --> 00:27:27.712
A LOOK AT THE CAMERAS AND SEE IF

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.481
IF THERE ACTUALLY IS SMOKE IN

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:31.016
THE AREA IT GIVES US.

00:27:31.082 --> 00:27:34.853
A SENSE OF OF HOW RAPIDLY --

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:36.488
AN INCIDENT IS GROWING AND

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.757
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE VALUE

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:39.824
OF THE CURRENT --

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:43.228
CAMERA SYSTEM THAT IS OUT THERE --

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:46.064
OTHER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS --

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:47.932

ARE UNDERSTAFFED AND STAFFED.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.070
FORMS --

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:55.407

00:27:55.473 --> 00:27:57.008
INCIDENTS AND GIVE US A LOOK.

00:27:57.075 --> 00:27:57.876
AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE

00:27:57.942 --> 00:28:01.079
GROUND CASES THROUGH THE SMOKE

00:28:01.146 --> 00:28:02.947
UNDER THE SMOKE NOW AND WE CAN

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:04.182
SEE EXACTLY --

00:28:04.249 --> 00:28:06.684
WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE --

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:09.687
AT THE THE OUT OF FIRE --

00:28:09.754 --> 00:28:10.855
AND THEN USE THAT INFORMATION TO

00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:12.657
MAKE DECISIONS AS TO WHERE TO

00:28:12.724 --> 00:28:14.159
PUT POLICE RESOURCES IN THAT

00:28:14.225 --> 00:28:18.063
KIND OF THAT KIND OF THING --

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:20.031
WE DO HAVE OF MODELING

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:21.599
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE USE THEIR

00:28:21.666 --> 00:28:23.368
PROGRAMS THAT WILL --

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:26.504
USE VARIOUS INPUTS AND KICK OUT

00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:28.640
A PREDICTION OF WHERE A FIRE IS

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:31.242
LIKELY TO GO AND WE USE THOSE --

00:28:31.309 --> 00:28:33.311
THAT WE DON'T USE THOSE ON THE

00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:34.813
FIRE LINE BUT WE DO USE THOSE.

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.915
AS A PLANNING AND PRE PLANNING

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:39.184
TOOL -- IN

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.621
IN OUR DAILY OPERATIONS --

OPERATES AND IN SOME CASES FUNDS

00:28:56.301 --> 00:28:58.303
BUT DOESN'T OWN HOME --

00:28:58.369 --> 00:29:01.139
WE HAVE A SYSTEM OF REMOTE --

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:02.774
AUTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS --

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:03.408
THESE ARE WEATHER STATIONS THAT

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:06.344
ARE SCATTERED THE LANDSCAPE

00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:08.346
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:08.913
THEY'RE PART OF A NATIONWIDE

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.981
SYSTEM.

SO WE'VE HEARD IN THIS IN IN IN

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:24.195
SIMILAR HEARINGS --

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:27.532

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:35.306
SYSTEM THAT IS ALMOST ON A MILE

00:29:35.373 --> 00:29:37.509
BY MILE BASIS ACROSS THE

00:29:37.575 --> 00:29:38.510
LANDSCAPE WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:40.278
ACROSS CALIFORNIA IS ONE MAKE

AUTOMATED WEATHER STATIONS ARE

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.185
MILES AND MILES APART AND

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:48.920
THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT A

00:29:48.987 --> 00:29:51.456

WE ALSO.

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:03.701
HAVE -- A

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:07.105
PREDICTIVE SERVICES UNIT IN --

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:08.940
EACH OF OUR GEOGRAPHIC --

00:30:09.007 --> 00:30:10.808
COORDINATION CENTERS. ONE IN

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:12.510
RIVERSIDE FOR THE SOUTH HALF OF

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.679
THE STATE AND ONE IN REDDING FOR

00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.981
THE NORTH HALF OF THE STATE --

00:30:17.048 --> 00:30:19.717
THIS IS A NATIONWIDE SYSTEM --

BIG ENOUGH AND WE HAVE A A A

00:30:34.265 --> 00:30:35.533
DIVERSE ENOUGH.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.935
KIND OF LANDSCAPE THAT WE

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.137
REQUIRE TWO OF THESE CENTERS AND

00:30:39.204 --> 00:30:40.238
WHAT THEY DO IS THEY LOOK AT

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:42.340
FIRE WEATHER --

00:30:42.407 --> 00:30:43.474
THEY LOOK AT FIRE WEATHER IN

00:30:43.541 --> 00:30:46.344
VERY GREAT DETAIL DOWN TO THE

00:30:46.411 --> 00:30:48.012
THE FINE FUELS AND THEIR FUEL

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.547
MOISTURE AND HOW THAT'S CHANGING

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:50.815
THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

00:30:50.882 --> 00:30:52.383
THE HEAVIER FUELS AND I'M

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.385
TALKING ABOUT VEGETATION FUELS.

00:30:54.452 --> 00:30:57.155
AND HOW THOSE ARE ARE AFFECTED

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.623
ON A SEASONAL BASIS.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.992
AND THEY DRY OUT IN THE SPRING

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.927
AND THEN THEY DON'T VOICE AND UP

00:31:02.994 --> 00:31:04.495
UNTIL WELL INTO THE WINTER --

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:05.730
THEY THEY LOOK AT THE

THEN THE WEATHER --

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:11.135
THAT'S HAPPENING AS WELL AND

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.837
THEY UTILIZE ALL OF THOSE

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.872
CRITERIA TO DETERMINE --

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:18.042
A PRODUCT THAT'S GIVEN FOR TODAY

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:20.211
AND TOMORROW WHAT WHAT IS MY

KIND OF THAT LONG TERM.

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:46.904
PLANNING AND ALL OF THAT'S DONE

00:31:46.971 --> 00:31:48.539
THROUGH THOSE TWO CENTERS AND

00:31:48.606 --> 00:31:51.709
THEY THEY PROVIDE THAT DAILY --

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.745
TO OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.546
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS --

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:58.149
THROUGH THEIR WEBSITES --

00:31:58.216 --> 00:31:59.250
THAT ARE ALL UNDER THE THE GAS

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:00.885
TAX.

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:02.220
SO.

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:04.188
WE HAVE THOSE --

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.258
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOL --

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:08.326
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:10.161
COLLABORATION TOOL --

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:11.896
WHICH IS SCALP THAT IS --

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:14.899
JOINT OF PROJECT --

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:16.267
FOR A PLATFORM THAT WE CAN WE

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.769
CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THESE --

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.605
TYPES OF DATA ON ONE PLACE AT

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:23.274
ONE TIME THAT'S IN COLLABORATION --

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:26.477
WITH WITH --

00:32:26.544 --> 00:32:29.213
SHE AND AND A CALLOW YES CAL

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.515
FIRE -- AS

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.784
PRIMARIES IN THAT AND AND WE'LL

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.519
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE

00:32:34.585 --> 00:32:36.554
FUTURE BUT THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:38.790
WERE USING OUR I KNOW I I AND

00:32:38.856 --> 00:32:39.857
MANNED --

00:32:39.924 --> 00:32:41.759
AERIAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS --

00:32:41.826 --> 00:32:43.194
WHEN WE HAVE INCIDENTS WE CAN

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:45.129
PUT THOSE IN THE AIR THROUGH A

00:32:45.196 --> 00:32:47.398
CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD --

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:49.033
THE DOMESTIC --

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.402
OPERATIONS WE CAN GET INTO WHEN

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:53.671
WE HAVE A LARGER --

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.473
INCIDENT THAT REQUIRES A

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.742
MILITARY RESPONSE THAT GIVES US

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.210
AN OPPORTUNITY THROUGH ACCOUNT

00:32:59.277 --> 00:33:02.313
CAL GUARD AGAIN. TO ACCESS --

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.082
ASSETS THAT WOULD BE --

00:33:04.148 --> 00:33:05.350
ABLE -- TO

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:07.585
LOOK AT THAT --

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:12.523
THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS --

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:16.394
AS WE HAD TO MOVE FURTHER INTO.

00:33:16.461 --> 00:33:18.162
OUTER SPACE.

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:20.098
WE DO THROUGH --

00:33:20.164 --> 00:33:23.601
THROUGH NASA AND THROUGH --

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:25.136
THE NEED TO SEE WHICH IS THE

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:27.338
NATIONAL INTERAGENCY FIRE CENTER

00:33:27.405 --> 00:33:29.941
WE HAVE ACCESS TO A REMOTE

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:31.309
SENSING TECHNOLOGIES --

00:33:31.376 --> 00:33:33.211
THAT WE CAN WE CAN TURN ON AND

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:35.446
TAKE A LOOK AT THE THOSE WOULD

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:38.316
INCLUDE --

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.485
THINGS LIKE --

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:42.820
GEO SPACE --

00:33:42.887 --> 00:33:44.389
TOOLS THROUGH THE MOTOR

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:48.126
SATELLITE AND AND GOES SATELLITE

00:33:48.192 --> 00:33:50.595
NOTICES OF MODERATE RESOLUTION

00:33:50.661 --> 00:33:52.063
IMAGERY --

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.198
SPECTROMETER THE THESE DON'T

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:56.167
GIVE US A VERY FINE GRAIN LOOK

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:58.202
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT RIGHT NOW

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:00.405
OUR LOOK FROM OUTER SPACE --

00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:03.474
GIVES US LARGE BLOCKS ON A MAP

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.009
THAT SHOW US WHERE HEAT

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:05.943
SIGNATURES ARE THEY'RE NOT VERY

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:06.577
TIGHT.

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.446
WE CAN'T I COULDN'T WALK YOU TO

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.614
A PLACE.

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.785
WHERE A HEAT SIGNATURE WAS FROM --

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:16.154
WE CAN WITH THE AERIAL

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.822
SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS WHICH WE

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.990
HAVE -- THAT

00:34:19.056 --> 00:34:20.224
ARE THROUGH THE THROUGH THE

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:21.659
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:23.361
THINGS LIKE --

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:24.962
THE FIRE WATCH --

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.564
COBRA HELICOPTERS.

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:29.834
AND NYROP SWITCHES --

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.436
NIGHT FLYING --

00:34:31.502 --> 00:34:32.737
INFRARED.

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:34.172
OPERATIONS THAT WE PUT OVER

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.373
FIRES.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.774
EVERY NIGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.209
WHERE THE FIRE WAS LAST NIGHT

00:34:38.276 --> 00:34:39.844
BUT BY THE TIME I GET THAT LOOK

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:41.946
AT IT IN THE MORNING SORRY.

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:42.580
LOOK AT IN THE MORNING THE FIRES

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:43.481
MOVED.

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:44.816
SO THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:49.053
WE ARE AND THERE'S A LOT MORE WE

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.422
NEED TO PULL TOGETHER --

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.891
BUT THAT THAT IS A A BROAD LOOK

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:56.661
AT WHAT CURRENTLY CAL FIRE AND

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.296
THE FIRE SERVICES USING --

00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:00.898
FOR WILD FIRE KIND OF

00:35:00.965 --> 00:35:02.433
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON THE

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.635
TECHNOLOGY FRONT.

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.170
THANK YOU AND I'LL TAKE

00:35:06.237 --> 00:35:08.606

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:31.062
ASSETS AND DECISION MAKING AND

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.797
MAJOR EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN THE

00:35:32.864 --> 00:35:34.532
STATE -- YOU

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:35.600
KNOW I DON'T LAST YEAR --

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.703
WAS A ANOTHER CRAZY YEAR --

00:35:38.769 --> 00:35:41.372
FOR AND IMPACTFUL YEAR FOR FIRES --

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.640
CAL FIRE BUT PROBABLY FUNDED

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.141
MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND FIRES

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.177
BUT IT WAS REALLY A SERIES OF

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:49.180
ABOUT -- OF

00:35:49.247 --> 00:35:50.515
FOUR FIVE MAJOR FIRES THAT WOULD

00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.750
RESULT IN A COMPLETE STATE WIDE

00:35:52.817 --> 00:35:55.653
RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT --

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.722
THOSE OPERATIONS AND IN THE

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.590
STATE OPERATIONS CENTER --

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:01.158
IS WHERE ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.860
ENTITIES COME TOGETHER AND

00:36:02.927 --> 00:36:04.061
HAVING GOOD SITUATIONAL

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:07.298
AWARENESS HAVING GOOD DATA --

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:08.299
THEY CAN TO BE TURNED IN THE

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.901
DATA ANALYTICS AND HELP WAS THEN

00:36:09.967 --> 00:36:11.669
MAKE DECISIONS IN A VERY RAPID

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.337
WAY -- IS

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:16.340
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT.

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:16.641
THAT WELL --

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:21.345
WELL TACTICALLY ON THE GROUND --

00:36:21.412 --> 00:36:23.114
OPERATIONS CENTER IS THE GAS TAX

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.081
THAT -- TOM

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.950
AND MENTIONED --

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.618
ALL OF THAT RULES UP INTO OUT

00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:29.153
STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE --

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.788
WITH REGARDS TO WHAT IS

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:33.224
HAPPENING NO.

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.926
ONE INCIDENT REALLY.

00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:36.460
TENDS TO BE CONFINED TO ONE

00:36:36.527 --> 00:36:39.163
GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THEY ARE FIRES

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.464
TEND TO NOT LOOK AT BOUNDARIES

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.500
AND THEY SPREAD VERY RAPIDLY

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:43.768
PARTICULARLY THE EXTREME FIRES

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.002
THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING IN THE

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.403
STATE.

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.637
BUT WE'RE AN ALL HAZARDS

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.472
ORGANIZATION SO IT COULD BE THE

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.740
WAY THAT --

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.943
WE GET FLOODING WHERE WE HAVE A

00:36:52.009 --> 00:36:53.077
HUGE AMOUNT OF RAIN AND THAT IS

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.779
SIERRA FRONT BUT THE WAY THE

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:56.581
WATER FLOWS IN CALIFORNIA WE GET

00:36:56.647 --> 00:36:58.583
FLOODING IN THE LOWER --

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.318
A COUNTIES MUCH LIKE WE'RE

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:01.752
SEEING NOW IN CINEMA --

00:37:01.819 --> 00:37:03.588
AND HUMBLED AND PARTS OF

00:37:03.654 --> 00:37:05.256
MENDOCINO WHERE YOU'RE GETTING A

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:07.291
LOT OF OF OF OF FLOW COMING DOWN

00:37:07.358 --> 00:37:09.293
SO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.162
SITUATION AWARENESS THE

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.663
CAPABILITIES IN A VERY BROAD.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.933
PERSPECTIVE IN THE ABILITY --

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.538
TO AND APPROPRIATE --

00:37:20.605 --> 00:37:23.307
TO WHILE --

00:37:23.374 --> 00:37:25.176
FOR ARE WHAT JUST ONE OF THE

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:26.243
HAZARDS WHEN I MENTION FLOOD

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.145
EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER --

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.513
ANY SITUATION AWARENESS TOOLS

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.616
ARE IMPORTANT FOR US.

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:33.217
IN FOR ON THE FRONT END OF THESE

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:34.652
ADVANCED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.420
HAPPENING IN THE CASE A WILDFIRE

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.722
THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:38.923
IMPORTANT.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.091
BECAUSE WE ARE --

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:43.394
WORKING TO REFINE OUR ABILITY TO

00:37:43.461 --> 00:37:43.995
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE NATIONAL

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:45.596
WEATHER SERVICE SAYS WHERE HAVE

00:37:45.663 --> 00:37:48.132
A RED FLAG WARNING --

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:50.334
THAT ENCOMPASSES. FIVE OR SIX

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.669
COUNTIES --

00:37:51.736 --> 00:37:54.472
WHAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT MEAN --

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:57.775
WITH REGARDS TO HOW DO WE PLACE

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:58.709
RESOURCES --

00:37:58.776 --> 00:37:59.210
THEY ARE PRE POSITIONED

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.312
RESOURCES IN A PLACE THAT IF

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.280
THERE'S A FIRE START WE CAN BE

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.315
VERY VERY --

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:06.017
RAPIDLY GET ON THAT AND AND

00:38:06.083 --> 00:38:09.787
MINIMIZE THE THE SPREAD --

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:12.623
WE KNOW THAT THE CAL FINDING IT

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:13.758
MERELY LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:15.626
RESPONDING IMMEDIATELY --

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:16.560
BUT THE ONE OF THE ROLES OF ALL

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:18.295
WE ASK IS TO BRING TOGETHER ALL

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.697
THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.932
AND THEY YES ASSETS. TO BE ABLE

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:23.768
TO COME IN AND SUPPORT --

00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.169
FIRES THAT THAT CAL FIRE IS

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:26.470
HAVING TO MANAGE --

00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:27.705
THE BECOME THAT ARE MOVING VERY

00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:28.839
RAPIDLY.

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:30.041
SO IF WE GET A RED FLAG

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:31.776
CONDITION --

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:32.309
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:34.145
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IS BEING

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.180
ABLE TO BE FINE --

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.815
THOSE MICROCLIMATES SO THOSE

00:38:37.882 --> 00:38:40.551
THOSE THOSE --

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.686
AREAS WHERE.

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:42.253
THROUGH THE CAMERAS THE TOM

00:38:42.319 --> 00:38:42.920
MENTIONED TO THE WEATHER

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.488
STATIONS THAT THAT THE DIRECTOR

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:45.423
MENTIONED --

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.924
WE CAN WE CAN REALLY GET THAT

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.060
DATA AND REFINED WHERE THE

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:51.362
HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF A FIRE

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:53.264
STARTS ARE GOING TO BE WAR MAYBE

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.732
THE HIGHEST IMPACT ARE GOING TO

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:55.866
BE BASED UPON --

00:38:55.933 --> 00:38:58.302
DENSITY OF THE COMMUNITY --

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:59.603
BASED UPON THE WILDFIRE MAPS

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.438
THAT -- AND

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:01.906
HISTORICAL DATA THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.140
AS THAT ALL OF US TO BE

00:39:03.207 --> 00:39:05.242
INTEGRATED MUCH LIKE A FUSION

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:06.677
CENTER HAS TO BECOME COME

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:08.112
TOGETHER --

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.480
TO BE ABLE --

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.882
TO EFFECTIVELY APPLY RESOURCE

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:13.884
MINIMIZE --

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:17.722
THE AMOUNT OF OF DAMAGE --

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.924
YOU KNOW BETWEEN SEVENTEEN AND

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.459
EIGHTEEN WE HAD --

00:39:21.525 --> 00:39:24.028
YOU KNOW OF THE FIRES AND IN THE

00:39:24.095 --> 00:39:25.763
NORTH BAY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.164
THEN AGAIN IN.

00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:28.365
EIGHTEEN BETWEEN THOSE TWO

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:30.534
INCIDENTS WE LOST CLOSE TO

00:39:30.601 --> 00:39:32.002
THIRTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES --

00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:33.938
IS IS IS A PHENOMENAL TWO YEARS

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.307
AND WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.541
EVOLVE --

00:39:37.608 --> 00:39:42.113
OUR SITUATION AWARENESS ARE --

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.514
UP YOU KNOW AUTOMATED

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:45.449
INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES --

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.885
FROM BUT THE TECHNOLOGY TO BE

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.220
ABLE TO HELP US MAKE OUR

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:51.555
DECISIONS OF MORE RAPIDLY.

00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.157
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN --

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:54.925
THESE FIRES ARE MOVING SO FAST

00:39:54.992 --> 00:39:55.860
THAT WE ARE.

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:58.195
AT THAT COORDINATION LEVEL AT

00:39:58.262 --> 00:40:01.532
THE WITH REGARDS TO BEING ABLE

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:03.300
TO GET REAL TIME --

00:40:03.367 --> 00:40:06.036
THE DATA ON ON FIRE PERIMETERS

00:40:06.103 --> 00:40:07.838
OR IMPACTS AND SO WE'RE HAVING

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.774
TO DO A LOT MORE INTENSIVE

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.509
COORDINATION WITH THE INCIDENT

00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:13.377
MANAGEMENT TEAMS ON THE GROUND.

00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:14.845
AND COMMUNICATING UP INTO THE

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.714
STATE OPERATIONS CENTER --

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:18.182
ON HOW HOW --

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:20.718
HOW RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AND AND

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:24.755
WHERE WE WE PLACE THEM --

00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:25.923
THIRD REPORTER MENTIONED THE

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.725
SCALP THE THE SITUATIONAL WEARS

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.027
A COLLABORATIVE TOOL THIS IS UP --

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.128
OF A PRETTY PHENOMENAL

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:32.663
CAPABILITY THAT WE'VE WE'VE

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.532
JOINTLY INVESTED IN --

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.300
IT WAS --

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:37.001
ORIGINALLY --

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:38.602
IS FUNDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:42.239
HOMELAND SECURITY AND UP WAS A

00:40:42.306 --> 00:40:44.041
CAPABILITY THAT WAS --

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.577
BILL BY MIT LINCOLN LABS --

00:40:46.644 --> 00:40:47.344
AND THEN IT WAS GIVEN TO THE

00:40:47.411 --> 00:40:49.013
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE BOTH

00:40:49.079 --> 00:40:50.014
ARE ORGANIZATIONS WERE

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.515
INSTRUMENTAL IN BEING ABLE TO

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:52.750
BUILD OUT --

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.385
WILL -- WHAT

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:56.687
THAT PLATFORM WOULD LOOK

00:40:56.754 --> 00:40:58.455
UTILIZATION FOR EYES ALSO

00:40:58.522 --> 00:40:59.690
INCLUDE A LOT OF LOCAL

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.225
GOVERNMENT PARTNERS THROUGHOUT

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:02.359
THE STATE?

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:05.529
AND THIS THIS.

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:07.765
COLLABORATIVE TOOL NOW --

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:09.767
REALLY IT GIVES US YEAH --

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.703
SOME REAL TIME CAPABILITY TO

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.605
FACILITATE TACTICAL INFORMATION

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:16.407
SHARING AMONGST ALL THE RESPOND

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:18.576
OR IS THERE IN THE FIELD AS WELL

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:19.944
AS INTER AGENCY.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.745
SITUATION WHERE THIS THIS IS ONE

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:23.480
OF THE FIRST MAJOR COLLABORATIVE

00:41:23.547 --> 00:41:25.182
TOOLS THAT WE HAD THAT WE CAN

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.484
ALL BE LOOKING AT SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.920
TO BE ABLE --

00:41:29.987 --> 00:41:31.488
TO A BIT MAKE DECISIONS AND MOVE

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:34.792
RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY AND OF

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.393
THERE AREN'T THERE ARE CLOSE TO

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.062
SIXTEEN HUNDRED USERS NOW --

00:41:38.128 --> 00:41:41.232
ON THE REGISTERED USERS ON SCALP

00:41:41.298 --> 00:41:43.100
AND UP REALLY IT IT HELPS AS

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.301
WITH INCIDENT LOCATION IN

00:41:44.368 --> 00:41:45.469
PERIMETER --

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:48.973
IT HELPS AS WITH OUR OUR UP A

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.342
BRANCH OF DIVISION BREAKS WITH

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.943
DIRECTOR PORTER MENTION --

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:53.978
WHERE OUR COMMAND POST THE

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.646
STAGING ITS IN SUPPORT LOCATIONS

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.248
ARE -- HOW

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:59.583
WE DO EVACUATION AREAS HOW MANY --

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.085
STRUCTURES COULD POTENTIALLY BE

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:02.353
IMPACTED --

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:04.121
AS FIRE SPREAD HAPPENS AND THIS

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.356
IS IMPORTANT WHEN WE SEEK

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.624
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.992
BECAUSE EARLY ON IN A LOT OF

00:42:08.058 --> 00:42:09.593
THESE FIRES --

00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:10.127
WE ARE --

00:42:10.194 --> 00:42:11.462
SEEKING WHAT'S CALLED THE FIRE

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:13.697
MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE GRANT FROM

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:14.598
THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:16.300
AGENCY THOSE F. MAJOR CRITICAL

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.335
BECAUSE THEY CAN PROVIDE

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:19.403
IMMEDIATE --

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.372
FUNDING TO HELP OFFSET THE COST

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:23.574
OF OF THAT INITIAL RESPONSE BUT

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:26.043
THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC CRITERIA.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:27.344
THAT ARE REQUIRED AND IN THIS

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:29.213
COLLABORATIVE TOOL HELPS US TO

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.348
IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFY --

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:32.917
THAT INFORMATION THAT

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:35.119
COLLABORATIVE TOOLS ALSO TIED TO

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:36.420
INITIATIVES THAT --

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.622
MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE --

00:42:38.689 --> 00:42:42.326
BUT CAL FIRE AND YES STARTED A

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:45.496
VEHICLE OKAY THAT'S THAT'S

00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:48.632
ABILITY THAT SOURCES ASTOR

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:50.200
MOVING AROUND THE STATE IN REAL

SOME OF THE OTHER MODALITIES

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:04.982
THAT WE'RE USING --

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.483
THAT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER

00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:08.152
HAS ABILITY TO TIE INTO.

00:43:08.218 --> 00:43:11.422
A MANY THE CAMERAS THAT --

00:43:11.488 --> 00:43:13.157
TRUCK REPORTER TALKED ABOUT ALSO

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.825
ALL OUR CALTRANS CAMERAS --

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:16.160
THERE'S A A NUMBER OF PRIVATE

00:43:16.226 --> 00:43:17.261
SECTOR CAMERAS THAT WE HAVE

THE FAR RIGHT SOME OF THE WHAT

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.295
WE'RE SEEING OUT OF THOSE DRONE

00:44:58.362 --> 00:44:59.229
PICTURES THEY CAN FLY AT NIGHT

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:00.230
THEY CAN FLY IN THE DAY THEY CAN

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.465
CUT TO SOME OF THE SMOKE AND

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.100
THAT'S VERY VERY --

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.635
HELPFUL FOR US --

SECTOR SATELLITES ACTUALLY --

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:41.305
ARE ARE WORTH OUR OUR EFFORT --

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:43.006
SO -- I I I

00:45:43.073 --> 00:45:44.508
GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT YOU

00:45:44.575 --> 00:45:45.909
KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S

00:45:45.976 --> 00:45:47.344
BUT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF EFFORT

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.012
GOING ON IN THE AREA OF

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:51.482
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND IN --

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:53.150
THE ABILITY TO GET GOOD

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:54.451
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TOOLS.

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.453
AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NO QUESTION

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.889
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE --

00:45:58.956 --> 00:46:00.357
BUT IT HAS TO BE DONE IN A IN AN

00:46:00.424 --> 00:46:01.758
INTEGRATED --

00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:03.260
COLLABORATIVE FASHION --

00:46:03.327 --> 00:46:05.028
GIVEN THE FACT THAT OF THE WAY

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.697
WE DO OPERATE IN THE STATE --

00:46:06.763 --> 00:46:07.865
WITH STATE AND LOCAL ALL OUR

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:10.501
MUTUAL AID ASSETS --

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:11.068
AND EVENTUALLY THIS WILL TIE

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:13.504
INTO -- ARE

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.339
ENHANCEMENT OF OUR NINE ONE ONE

00:46:15.405 --> 00:46:16.607
SYSTEM -- OR

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:18.242
OR HIS NINE ONE ONE IN OUR

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:19.977
ABILITY --

00:46:20.043 --> 00:46:21.712
TO MOVE INTO WHAT'S CALLED FIRST

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.413
NET WHICH IS A BROADBAND BEING.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.884
INTEROPERABLE I DATA PLATFORM --

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:27.985
TO BE ABLE TO SHE SHARE REAL

00:46:28.051 --> 00:46:30.587
TIME DATA WITH RESPONDENTS SO

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:31.788
THAT WOULD BE P. MUTUALLY TEAMS

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.657
ARE RESPONDING TO SUPPORT CAL

00:46:33.724 --> 00:46:35.259
FIRE FIRES --

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:37.060
THEY'RE ACTUALLY SEEING AS THE

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.662
RESPONDING A GETTING DATA --

00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:39.630
SO THAT THOSE STRIKE TEAM

00:46:39.696 --> 00:46:40.664
COMMANDERS CAN BE MAKING

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:42.099
DECISIONS.

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:44.001
EVEN BEFORE THEY ARRIVE --

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:46.069
INTO THE THE AREA OF OPERATION

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:48.105
RIGHT NOW THEIR LITTLE BIT BLIND

00:46:48.172 --> 00:46:48.872
UNTIL THEY GET IN THE EVERY

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.507
OPERATION THEY GET ASSIGNMENTS

00:46:50.574 --> 00:46:51.942
THIS IS GOING TO BE --

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:54.111
AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THAT --

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:55.479
THAT CAPABILITY --

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.048
AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST SAY

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:01.618
TO THE WE'RE VERY ENCOURAGED HIM

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:02.486
TO TO DO IT ADDITIONAL

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:03.954
ASSESSMENTS THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.789
VERY SIGNIFICANT ASSESSMENTS

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:06.924
DONE -- IN A

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.759
FROM THE PAST BLUE RIBBON

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:09.393
COMMISSIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

00:47:09.459 --> 00:47:10.961
IN PLACE --

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.629
TWO OF THEM ACTUALLY --

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:15.065
SINCE ABOUT TWO THOUSAND AND

00:47:15.132 --> 00:47:16.733
THREE THAT OUTLINED MANY OF THE

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.367
THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:19.803
TODAY AND SINCE THAT TIME BOTH

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.905
ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR PARTNERS

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:23.173
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.907
PARTNERS IN THE U. S. FOR

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:25.209
SERVICE.

00:47:25.275 --> 00:47:25.809
THE OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES A

00:47:25.876 --> 00:47:28.445
FEMA HAVE WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.013
TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:31.215
RECOMMENATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.449
PUT FORTH --

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:33.884
IN THOSE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSIONS

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.852
AND UP THAT'S ACTUALLY HELPED US

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:38.855
TO GET WERE OUT TODAY WITH OUR

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:39.823
CAPABILITY [inaudible]

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.959
THANK YOU.

00:47:42.025 --> 00:47:43.894
THANK YOU TO ALL THE PANELS THAT

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:44.461
YOU DIRECTOR --

00:47:44.528 --> 00:47:45.462
GOOD YOU SHE AND I THINK WE HAVE

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.930
SEVERAL QUESTIONS SO WE'LL TAKE

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:48.465
SOME QUESTIONS MEMBERS RIGHT NOW

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:52.869
IF YOU DON'T MIND --

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:53.437
STICK AROUND WE'LL START WAS

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.037
CENTERED HUESO.

00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:55.005
THANK YOU --

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:56.406
I GUESS THE NUMBER ONE RULE.

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:57.674
OF FIGHTING FIRE SINCE I'VE BEEN

00:47:57.741 --> 00:47:58.842
IN GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIVENESS

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:00.711
AND HOW FAST WE CAN GET TO THOSE

00:48:00.777 --> 00:48:03.013
FIRES AND AND USUALLY THE FASTER

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.015
YOU GET TO THEM THE LIKELIHOOD

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:06.483
THEY'LL BE SMALLER.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.953
AND AND LESS LESS DEVELOPED.

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.055
SO LOOKING AT AT THE THE

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:14.224
PRESENTATION TODAY I I WANTED TO

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.092
FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:16.026
YOU SAID AND SATELLITES BECAUSE

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.462
BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED SATELLITES.

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.797
AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF OUR

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.432
TECHNOLOGY AND SATELLITES IS

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:25.202
VERY ADVANCED AT ANY GIVEN POINT

00:48:25.269 --> 00:48:26.670
WE HAVE MULTIPLE SATELLITES I

00:48:26.737 --> 00:48:27.771
JUST.

00:48:27.838 --> 00:48:29.773
ONE THAT THE GOVERNMENT USES

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.841
MAINLY FOR SURVEILLANCE.

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:31.808
WINDOWS PRINT PRINCIPLE

00:48:31.875 --> 00:48:33.176
DEVELOPMENT OF OF SATELLITE

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.779
TECHNOLOGY BY BY THE GOVERNMENT

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.048
NASA -- AND

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:39.783
AND SO WE CAN GET.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.852
REALLY DETAILED INFORMATION FROM

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:42.586
THESE VERY --

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:46.156
HI.

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.924
THESE THESE THESE.

00:48:47.991 --> 00:48:49.126
OUR CAMERAS THAT HAVE A VERY

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:52.029
HIGH RESOLUTION ABLE TO FOCUS

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:55.365
VERY IN DEPTH AND IF IF.

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:56.967
WE CAN USE THE TECHNOLOGY TO

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.735
IDENTIFY SMOKE.

00:48:58.802 --> 00:48:59.870
AND WE HAVE --

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:02.205
THE EQUIPMENT.

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:03.874
THAT IS SPREAD OUT --

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.475
GEOGRAPHICALLY --

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:08.145
IN A COORDINATED FASHION --

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:09.546
WE CAN RESPOND TO THESE FIRES

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.481
MUCH QUICKER LET'S SAY --

00:49:11.548 --> 00:49:13.183
MOBILIZING IN YOU KNOW WHATEVER

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.252
YOU HAVE NEAREST THAT INCIDENT

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:16.687
COULD BE HELICOPTER COULD BE --

00:49:16.753 --> 00:49:18.221
YOU KNOW HELICOPTER AND FIRE

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:18.889
TRUCKS [inaudible]

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.991
SO.

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.226
WHY HAVEN'T WE LOOK AT SATELLITE

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:24.761
LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF?

00:49:24.828 --> 00:49:25.996
IT MAY BE JUST.

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.931
QUITMAN SPACE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:28.732
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FEDERAL

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.600
GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SUPPORT YEAR.

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.536
IS THAT SOMETHING THEY CAN DO TO

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:33.870
PROVIDE SUPPORT TO THE STATE AND

00:49:33.937 --> 00:49:35.605
HELPING US TO PROVIDE THAT

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:36.907
SURVEILLANCE INTERSTATE THROUGH

00:49:36.973 --> 00:49:38.775
SATELLITE EQUIPMENT AND CAN

00:49:38.842 --> 00:49:39.943
SATELLITE EQUIPMENT.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.913
MONITOR.

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.014
WITH SOMEBODY THERE LOOKING

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:45.982
SPECIFICALLY FOR SMOKE AND FIRES

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:48.185
AND AND ANYTHING THAT CAN.

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:50.454
POTENTIALLY.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.322
YOU KNOW BURN RIGHT IN OUR FORCE

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.624
BECAUSE CAMERAS I MEAN THEY'LL

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:56.460
BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO SITUATE

00:49:56.526 --> 00:49:58.562
CAMERAS ALL OVER THE ALL OVER

00:49:58.628 --> 00:49:59.696
THE STATE SPECIALLY.

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:01.665
AND THE LEAST POPULATED AREAS

00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:03.834
WHERE THERE'S LESS LIKE THIS

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.970
SOMEBODY CAN CALL IN NINE ONE

00:50:07.037 --> 00:50:08.672
ONE SEX MALE SMOKERS SEE SMOKE.

00:50:08.739 --> 00:50:10.107
HARDER IN FOURS BUT FROM WITH

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:11.108
THE SATELLITE.

00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:12.642
HE COULD ALMOST SEE ANYTHING

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:16.146
ANYWHERE AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND A

00:50:16.213 --> 00:50:18.582
SMALL INCIDENT OF SMOKE.

00:50:18.648 --> 00:50:20.083
COULD BE THAT TRIGGER THAT SAYS

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.852
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:50:21.918 --> 00:50:23.553
IT IS BUT SENATE.

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:25.455
HELICOPTER THERE.

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:26.923
LEE AND AND I KNOW YOU YOU

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:29.259
MENTIONED A WELL WE FIRST ONE

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:31.194
ASSESS THAT SMOKER.

00:50:31.261 --> 00:50:32.662
DO WE HAVE TO WAIT. FOR THAT

00:50:32.729 --> 00:50:34.398
FIRE TO DEVELOP BEFORE WE WE WE

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:37.934
SEND SOMEBODY TO ESPECIALLY IN A

00:50:38.001 --> 00:50:39.536
IN AN AREA.

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.004
THAT IS A HIGH RISK AREAS SHOULD

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:44.307
WE SHOULD WE BE A LITTLE MORE --

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.108
WILLING --

00:50:45.175 --> 00:50:47.177
TO DEPLOY [inaudible]

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.413
OUR RESOURCES.

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.948
AND AND WAIT LESS TO GATHER

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.251
INFORMATION YOU KNOW THAT SO.

00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:56.787
SATELLITES FIRST OF ALL.

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:57.788
WELL I STARTED IT ALL TURNED

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:59.890
OVER TO THE DIRECT PORTER --

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:00.891
SO -- WE'VE

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:01.792
BEEN LOOKING A LOT AND THE

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:03.627
SATELLITES AND AND I I THINK

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:06.096
THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF US --

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:08.265
KIND OF WATCH WHAT YOU KNOW DID

00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:10.400
SHE SHOWS WHERE THEY CAN.

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:11.868
NAVIGATE THE SATELLITE AND LOOK

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.136
DOWN AND SEE EXACTLY WHETHER OUT

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.671
AND AND AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.373
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT DEPARTMENT

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.241
OF DEFENSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST --

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:19.476
THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE

00:51:19.543 --> 00:51:20.977
CAPABILITY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:21.778
OF FRANCE WITH FEDERAL

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:24.114
GOVERNMENT HAS HERE DOMESTICALLY --

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:25.182
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE

00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:28.585
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO TRY --

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:31.087
TO GET THEM TO DECLASSIFY SOME

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.156
CAPABILITIES --

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:36.993
OF THAT SATELLITE MORE OR WORK

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.094
CLOSELY WITH US --

00:51:38.161 --> 00:51:39.663
TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:41.465
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT --

00:51:41.531 --> 00:51:43.400
IN THE IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:44.668
ACTUALLY COMING THE FULL

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:47.237
FLOURISH AND YOU KNOW WE DO YOU

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.172
WE DO EMPLOYEE SATELLITE

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.475
TECHNOLOGY NOW --

00:51:51.541 --> 00:51:53.577
BUT AS AS THE DRUG FOR MATCH AND

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:54.344
YOU KNOW THE SATELLITES.

00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:56.046
THE ORBIT SO YOU'RE GETTING A A

00:51:56.112 --> 00:51:58.982
A PIECE OF TIME AND IN SOME OF

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:01.952
THAT DATA IS REALLY GOOD BUT

00:52:02.018 --> 00:52:03.620
SINCE WE'RE NOT CONTROLLING THE

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:05.489
SATELLITES YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE TO

00:52:05.555 --> 00:52:06.656
SAY OKAY YOU KNOW.

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.058
CHANGE THAT THE APERTURE THAT

00:52:08.124 --> 00:52:09.626
SATELLITE AND JUST GET IT THE

00:52:09.693 --> 00:52:12.262
FOCUS IN ONE SPOT --

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:13.330
WE'RE NOT THERE YET --

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:15.165
WE THIS PAST FIRE SEASON WE DID

00:52:15.232 --> 00:52:17.167
TEST SOME PRIVATE SECTOR

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:18.768
SATELLITES AND AND THEY DO.

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:23.173
THEY DID PROVE TO GIVE US IN

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:24.908
FACT SOME OF THE PICTURES HERE

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:25.775
ARE FROM THAT PARTICULAR

00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.043
SATELLITE.

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:29.279
BUT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T --

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:31.781
HAVE CERTAIN KINDS OF INFRARED

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.016
AND OTHER KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY

00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.518
THAT YOU WE NEED SO THE NEXT

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:35.919
OPTION WOULD BE TO POSSIBLY YOU

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.554
KNOW.

00:52:37.621 --> 00:52:38.922
LARGER ON SATELLITE OR HAVE OUR

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.624
OWN CAPABILITY THAT WE CAN

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.859
MANEUVER THAT BUT I THINK THAT

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:44.494
THERE'S PROMISING WORK THAT'S

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.062
BEING DONE WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:46.963
OF DEFENSE SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:48.365
ONLY OUR STATE THAT THE ENTIRE

00:52:48.431 --> 00:52:50.667
COUNTRY MAYBE THE ENTIRE WORLD

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:51.334
WOULD BE.

00:52:51.401 --> 00:52:52.769
WOULD IF THERE WAS SOME

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:54.204
COOPERATIVE EFFORT TO SHARE

00:52:54.271 --> 00:52:55.872
INFORMATION YEAH --

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:58.108
AND AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

00:52:58.174 --> 00:53:00.710
PURPOSE OF OF LOOKING FOR FIRES

00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:02.779
YOU KNOW.

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.014
TO THAT THAT IF IF BECAUSE THE

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:04.481
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

00:53:04.548 --> 00:53:06.550
AT ANY GIVEN TIME HAS SOME BE OF

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.318
OUR STATE.

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:09.853
EVEN WITH THE ROAD TO PERDITION

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.621
OF OUR OF THE SATELLITES BECAUSE

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:13.823
A MULTIPLE SATELLITES TO YOU.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:14.824
TO BACK FILL IN.

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.626
AND AT SOME POINT THEY COULD

00:53:16.693 --> 00:53:18.228
REALLY HELP US IN THAT ASPECT.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:19.863
THE OTHER THE OTHER QUESTION WAS

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.164
ABOUT COVERAGE I MEAN.

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.966
YOU THERE IS --

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:23.466
FORCED CARBON PLAN THIS

00:53:23.533 --> 00:53:24.568
MENTIONED.

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.269
AND HOW WE ENHANCED OUR BUDGET

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:27.737
BY SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:29.573
WHICH IS A VERY HEALTHY SUM OF

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:30.440
MONEY.

00:53:30.507 --> 00:53:32.242
AND COUPLED WITH FEDERAL

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:33.076
FIREFIGHTING IN.

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:37.447
OF RESOURCES IN OUR STATE BASED.

00:53:37.514 --> 00:53:38.782
DOES I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT

00:53:38.848 --> 00:53:41.017
CARBON PLAN.

00:53:41.084 --> 00:53:44.321
BUT DOES IT ASSESS OUR READINESS

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:46.356
TO COMBAT FIRES STATEWIDE IN

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:47.791
TERMS OF HAVING THE RESOURCES

00:53:47.857 --> 00:53:49.192
NECESSARY.

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.961
AND TO BE PREPARED FOR THESE

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:53.630
EVENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:55.298
QUICKLY TO THESE EVENTS AND I'M

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:57.167
MOSTLY CONCERNED OR ARE WE READY

00:53:57.233 --> 00:53:58.735
TO RESPOND QUICKLY DO WE HAVE

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:02.272
WHAT WE NEED.

00:54:02.339 --> 00:54:03.440
SURE SO IN TERMS OF THE FIRST

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:05.675
CARBON PLAN IS FOCUSED MORE ON

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:08.278
OF FOREST HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE

00:54:08.345 --> 00:54:10.580
MEASURES AND RIGHT NOW.

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:11.781
AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:14.084
IS FORESTED AND AND A LARGE VAST

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.453
MAJORITY OF THOSE FORESTS ARE IN

00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:17.520
AN UNHEALTHY CONDITION WHERE

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:19.289
THERE. TO DANCE THERE'S MANY

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.725
DEAD OR DYING TREES AND AND THIS

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.159
JUST CREATES A SITUATION WHERE

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:24.995
YOU HAVE A LOT OF AND VEGETATION

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.463
FUELS THAT CAN.

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:28.398
RESULT IN THESE I AM EXTREMELY

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.467
SEVERE FIRES AND SO THE FOREST

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.402
CARBON PLAN AND A LOT OF THE

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:33.203
WORK THAT WAS DONE IN THE

00:54:33.269 --> 00:54:34.904
LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS FOCUSING

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:37.340
MORE ON HOW OVER THE LONG TERM

00:54:37.407 --> 00:54:39.109
DO WE MAKE THE FORESTS IN THE

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:39.609
STATE.

00:54:39.676 --> 00:54:41.945
HEALTHIER IS SO THAT THEY ARE

00:54:42.012 --> 00:54:43.313
NOT AS PRONE TO THESE VERY

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.116
DESTRUCTIVE FIRES AND THEN --

00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:47.717
SEPARATELY THROUGH BUDGET

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.819
AUGMENTATIONS AND IN RECENT

00:54:49.886 --> 00:54:51.688
YEARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:52.989
THE GOVERNOR HER PROVIDED THESE

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:54.758
ADDITIONAL FIRE RESPONSE

00:54:54.824 --> 00:54:56.793
RESOURCES AND SO YOU HAVE THESE.

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:00.296
YOU KNOW TWO DIFFERENT

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:03.333
PRIORITIES FULL TO MAKE OUR

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.701
FIRST HEALTHIER SO THERE'S LESS

00:55:04.768 --> 00:55:05.802
SEVERE FIRES AND LOWERS THAT

00:55:05.869 --> 00:55:07.203
RISK -- AS

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:09.172
WELL AS INCREASING CAL FIRE AND

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:12.342
YES IS ABILITY TO RESPOND AND

00:55:12.409 --> 00:55:18.648
I'LL LET THAT DOCTOR PORTER.

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:19.115
YES SAID.

00:55:19.182 --> 00:55:21.551
THE POOREST CARBON PLAN REALLY.

00:55:21.618 --> 00:55:22.152
GIVES US --

00:55:22.218 --> 00:55:23.520
A BLUEPRINT OF WHAT THE

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:27.290
ENVIRONMENT LOOKS LIKE THE THE

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:30.593
THIS STATE --

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.062
FIRE STRATEGIC PLAN KIND OF

00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:33.396
GIVES US A FRAMEWORK OF HOW

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:34.864
WE'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO THAT

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:35.832
WHICH IS.

00:55:35.899 --> 00:55:37.701
IS REALLY A HOLISTIC APPROACH

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:40.336
WHICH INCLUDES RESOURCES AS WELL

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:42.105
AS A MEETING BY RESPONDING

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:44.207
RESOURCES AS WELL AS THE

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.709
TREATMENTS THAT WE WOULD DO PRO

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.477
ACTIVELY AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.545
TOGETHER --

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:50.346
PROVIDE A SYSTEM OF OF FOREST

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:52.315
AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE THAT

00:55:52.382 --> 00:55:53.049
WILL.

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.051
THAT WILL REDUCE THE EFFECTS AND

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:55.652
THE RISK OF WILDFIRE IN THE

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:58.154
FUTURE -- SO

00:55:58.221 --> 00:56:00.557
THOSE ARE THOSE ITEMS --

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:02.292
I THINK THERE IS SOME PROMISE IN

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:03.893
THE FUTURE ON ON THE THE

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.628
SATELLITE FRONT I THINK THERE

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:06.696
THERE REALLY ISN'T THAT

00:56:06.763 --> 00:56:07.597
SOMETHING --

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:10.400
AS DIRECTOR GILLARD YUJI MENTION

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.069
WE WILL BE WORKING TOWARD WHAT

00:56:13.136 --> 00:56:15.572
THAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE FUTURE --

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:18.141
AND THERE ARE THE HURDLES THAT

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.609
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:22.145
BUT I WANTED ALSO TO MAKE SURE --

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:24.247
THAT I DIDN'T MISS SPEAK --

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:25.782
RELATED TO WHAT I'LL CALL GET

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:28.151
AWAY TIME THAT IS THE TIME THAT

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:31.454
THE THE ALARM GOES OFF IN THE

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.289
FIRE STATION. TWO TWO MINUTES

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.225
FROM THEN THAT THE ENGINES ON

00:56:35.291 --> 00:56:37.327
THE ROAD GOING TO WHATEVER THE

00:56:37.393 --> 00:56:39.295
INCIDENT HE IS --

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:42.232
GET AWAY TIME IS IS CRITICAL TO

00:56:42.298 --> 00:56:44.467
US SO GET AWAY TIME IS THE TIME

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.269
FROM WHEN THEY GET WHEN I GET

00:56:46.336 --> 00:56:48.772
THE CALL. TO WHEN I'M DRIVING

00:56:48.838 --> 00:56:52.108
DOWN THE ROAD TO GET TO THE CALL --

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:55.779
THE LAG THAT THAT WE WE HAVE A

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.547
SO THAT IS A TWO MINUTE WINDOW.

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:59.249
THE LAG THAT WE HAVE THAT THAT

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.451
COULD BE --

00:57:01.518 --> 00:57:04.187
SH DO REDUCED BY THESE OTHER

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.588
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.457
CAPABILITIES WOULD BE THE REPORT

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.691
TIME.

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.627
AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE WE

00:57:10.693 --> 00:57:11.961
NEVER ONCE THAT ONCE THERE'S A

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.963
REPORT WHETHER THEIR SMOKE IN

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.799
THE AIR OR NOT WE'RE LAUNCHING.

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.667
SO WE LAUNCH AN AIRCRAFT DURING

00:57:17.734 --> 00:57:18.802
THE PEAK OF SEASON.

00:57:18.868 --> 00:57:20.003
THERE ARE AIR TANKERS

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:23.339
HELICOPTERS BULLDOZERS --

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:25.542
AND ENGINES AND HAND HAND CREWS

00:57:25.608 --> 00:57:27.844
ALL HEADED TO A POINT ON EARTH

00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:28.945
THAT SOMEBODY SAID THERE'S A

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.613
FIRE EVEN IF THERE'S NO SMOKE IN

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.681
THE AIR.

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.150
SO THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS --

00:57:34.217 --> 00:57:35.752
CAPABILITY THAT WE USE THAT

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:38.888
THOSE CAMERAS FOR NOW IS SO I I

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.790
AM SITTING AT MY CONSOLE TO GET

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.525
ALL THAT STUFF ON THE ROAD.

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:43.793
AND NOW I'M DOING EACH CALL

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:46.362
BACKS --

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:47.530
SAYS HEY LET'S LET'S PULL IT UP

00:57:47.597 --> 00:57:48.598
SO WE CAN LOOK AND SEE WHAT'S

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:50.099
GOING ON OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.168
KNOW THE AREA THE ZOOM IN ON ORG

00:57:52.235 --> 00:57:54.170
OR THEY PAN TO OR LOOK AT THE

00:57:54.237 --> 00:57:55.371
CAMERA THAT'S LOOKING IN THAT

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:56.506
DIRECTION.

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:58.074
AND THEN THEY START TO GO OKAY

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.409
THIS IS REAL THIS THING IT'S

00:57:59.475 --> 00:58:00.610
BUILDING BECAUSE YOU CAN JUST

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.111
YOU CAN SEE FROM A SMOKE AT AN

00:58:02.178 --> 00:58:03.213
EARLY AGE.

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.981
WHETHER IT'S IT'S JUST KIND OF A

00:58:05.048 --> 00:58:06.649
WISPY OR IF IT'S BUILDING

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.318
QUICKLY AND SO THEN THEY'LL

00:58:08.384 --> 00:58:10.653
START TO TUNE THEMSELVES HEY.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.689
FRED GO GO GET ON THE PHONE

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:14.123
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE ALL NIGHT

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:15.191
WORKING ON THIS ONE START

00:58:15.258 --> 00:58:16.893
GETTING PEOPLE COMING BACK TO

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.460
WORK.

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:18.528
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:21.631
WERE USING IT FOR IN THE CENTER --

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.466
AND THEN THE RESOURCES ON THE

00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:26.236
GROUND ARE STILL USING.

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:29.672
THEIR THEIR HELICOPTER SEEM LIKE

00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:30.974
THE WISEST INVESTMENT FOR OUR

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.408
STATE IN TERMS OF RESPONSE OF

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.210
HAVING AT LEAST SOMETHING TO BE

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:36.212
ABLE.

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:38.248
TO DROP A LOT OF WATER OR OR A

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.183
FIRE RETARDANT ON ON A FIRE HOW

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:40.783
MANY OF THOSE THAT WE HAVE IN

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:41.451
THE STATE.

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.920
SO RIGHT NOW WE WE HAVE OUR OUR

WE WE HAVE --

00:58:50.793 --> 00:58:52.829
TWELVE NEW HELICOPTERS --

00:58:52.896 --> 00:58:54.764
BLACKROCK STYLE TO THEIR SEVENTY

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.666
AYE HELICOPTERS THAT ARE COMING

00:58:56.733 --> 00:58:57.166

RESOURCES --

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:03.806
SO SORRY SOME AREAS MAY HAVE.

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:05.675
HELICOPTERS SOME MAY NOT.

PRONE AREAS AND WHAT KIND OF I

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:10.046
MEAN OTHER I GUESS THE QUESTION

WHERE WE HAVE --

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:15.919
HI FIRE PRONE AREAS AND THAT'S A

00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:17.754
LOT OF ACREAGE I'VE SEEN THE MAP

00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.388

HOW MANY HELICOPTERS PER ACRE I

00:59:22.458 --> 00:59:24.594

MY CONCERN IS ON THIS IS FOR

SOME THIRTEEN BRAND NEW FIRE

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.692
ENGINES AND MIKE WHERE THIS IS

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:41.330
FIGHTING EQUIPMENT IS GETTING

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:42.432
OLD.

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:46.869
AT LEAST THOSE PEOPLE ON THE

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.005
GROUND THAT WE HAVE THE CORRECT --

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:50.440

ADDITIONAL ENGINES --

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:03.386
SO THIS WOULD INCREASE THE TOTAL

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:04.420
NUMBER OF FIRE ENGINES THAT

01:02:04.487 --> 01:02:06.022

REPLACED AT IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.568
ENGINES AND THAT THERE THE THE

01:02:18.634 --> 01:02:20.036
BUDGET HAS TYPICALLY INCLUDED

01:02:20.103 --> 01:02:21.104

DOLLARS.TO INCREASE CAL FIRES

01:02:25.541 --> 01:02:27.176
ABILITY TO REPLACE --

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.278
ENGINES AND AND OTHER MOBILE

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:30.546
EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT'S JUST

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.582
WEARING OUT MORE QUICKLY I'M

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:33.182
BECAUSE IT'S BEING USED MORE

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:36.085
HEAVILY ON THAT NINETEEN TWENTY

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:37.220
BUDGET MAKES THAT THREE MILLION

01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:39.055
DOLLAR AUGMENTATION PERMANENT.

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:44.193
AN ON GOING --

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.595

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:46.262
IS GOES TO YOUR EXPERTS THAT ARE

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.264
SITTING THERE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:48.498
THAT --

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:50.066
THESE THESE A FIRE ENGINES ARE A

01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:50.967
LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THE MAYBE WE

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:51.367
HAVE BUDGETED --

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:52.869
FOR SO I'M HOPING THAT WE HAVE A

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:54.937
CONVERSATION A TRUE CONVERSATION

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:55.972
WITH THIS --

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.907
OUT HOW FAR TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:00.543
THE FUNDS WHAT THEY NEED --

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.144
THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:04.280
OF THOSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:05.381
WHEN SAFE BUT I KNOW THAT THESE

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.716
ARE NOT CHEAP AND I KNOW IT

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:09.185
TAKES A LONG TIME TO ORDER THEM

01:03:09.252 --> 01:03:10.820
AND GET THEM BACK TO YOU IN A

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.622
TIMELY FASHION SO.

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:13.422
THAT'S THE WHAT'S ONE THING

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.624
SOUTH AROUND FOR ME.

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:15.591
THE OTHER ONE IS THAT --

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:19.495
ON LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION --

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:20.863
SO YOU'RE ASKING --

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.131
YES AND CAL FIRE TO DO AN

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.799
ASSESSMENT ARE YOU'RE

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.701
RECOMMENDING AN ASSESSMENT WOULD

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:27.537
BE BE FUNDING ADDITIONAL STAFF

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.205
FOR THEM TO DO SO --

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:33.209
BECAUSE OF TO ME THEY'RE

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:33.876
STRETCHED WAY.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:35.244
TO SO -- I

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:35.845
HATE MAKING PROMISES THAT WE

01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:36.512
CAN'T FILL AND PUTTING THEM IN A

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.748
SITUATION OF MANDATING SOMETHING

01:03:38.814 --> 01:03:39.982
THAT SHOULDN'T BE MANDATE.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.217
SO.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.418
SURE AND YEAH SO OUR OUR

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.487
RECOMMENDATION IS TO TO YOU ALL

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:46.289
TO CONSIDER REQUIRING THEM TO DO

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.023
IT -- I

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.224
THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:49.725
CAUGHT FIRE AND YES INDICATE

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:50.626
THAT THEY MIGHT NEED SOME

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.795
RESOURCES TO DO THAT IT WOULD BE

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:54.564
APPROPRIATE TO PROVIDE THEM

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:56.165
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.633
AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.769
CONTEXT OF PROVIDING A COUPLE

01:03:59.835 --> 01:04:00.570
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:03.139
CURRENT YEAR ANOTHER CLOSE TO A

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:03.773
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:04.907
BUDGET YEAR.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.342
AND AND LIKELY ADDITIONAL

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.444
AUGMENTATIONS OF THAT SCALE.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.812
GOING FORWARD FOR THE

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:13.015
FORESEEABLE HAVE THESE VERY

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:14.283
SEVERE --

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.885
FIRE CONDITIONS AND HAVING IT

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:18.387
BETTER INFORMATION TAKE GUIDE

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.890
THOSE AUGMENTATIONS COULD HELP

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.658
THE STATE TO SAVE MONEY IN THE

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:24.393
LONG RUN AND ENSURE THAT WHILE

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:26.262
YOU DO HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.964
AND LIMITED CAPACITY TO MAKE

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:29.532
THESE TYPES OF INCREASES.

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:31.000
THAT IT'S REALLY GOING TO THE

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.202
PLACES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:34.370
THE MOST BENEFITS.

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.472
AND AND REALLY MEET THE HIGHEST

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.840
PRIORITY NEEDS YEAH.

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:38.474
IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO ME IS

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:40.243
THAT WE HAVE THE SHORT TERM.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:41.611
IDEAS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS

01:04:41.677 --> 01:04:42.979
LONG TERM THIS IS THIS IS IN

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:45.081
KEEP GOING ON SO I JUST WANNA AT

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:46.015
THE STRESS THAT.

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.317
THE OTHER ONE IS TECHNOLOGY I AM

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.219
ALL FOR TECHNOLOGY IS A MATTER

01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:51.354
OF FACT ON MY TIME OFF THIS PAST

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.755
YEAR SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING AT

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.924
THE TECHNOLOGY.

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.125
SPENT SOMETIME SCRIPTS. TO WATCH

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.493
WHAT THEY'RE DOING --

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.262
I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED THAT --

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.630
WE COULD REALLY PRE POSITION

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:02.465
PEOPLE WHERE EARLIER WHEN WE

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.734
KNOW WHAT THE WIND IN THE ERRORS

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.202
THE IT THE AIR SPEEDS ARE GOING

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.502
ON THOUGH.

01:05:06.569 --> 01:05:13.476
THE WATER STREAMS --

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:14.010
BUT I DON'T WANT TO FORGET

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:16.345
SOMETHING THE DUE TO SAID

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:20.483
DIRECTOR DOES EVERYTHING.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:22.184
THE RIGHT AROUND COULD HAPPEN

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:23.586

IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.624
COULD HAPPEN DURING --

01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:29.925
THAT PERIOD OF TIME IF WE WERE

01:05:29.992 --> 01:05:31.193

AT A DEFICIT FOR CREW MEMBERS

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.879
CURRENTLY SO ALL OF THOSE ARE

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:40.549
THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON TO

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.718
TO BRING UP THE CREW COUNTS --

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.153
AS FAR AS YOU CAN I'M GONNA

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.956
MOVED AIRCRAFT --

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:49.825
SO FOR AIRCRAFT THE AIRCRAFT

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.560
THAT WE HAVE TO FLY --

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:54.964
WE CONTINUE TO HIRE --

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.399
PILOTS AS WE NEED --

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:59.134
TO IT FOR REFERENCE THE

01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.769
HELICOPTER PILOTS --

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.905
FOR CAL FIRE OUR STATE

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:05.274
CALIFORNIA AND LOUISE --

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:06.709
THE FIXED WING --

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:08.911
AIR TANKER PILOTS ARE ON A

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.647
CONTRACT BASIS WITH DYINGCORPS

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:12.715
AND SO DYNCORP.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:14.450
PROVIDES THOSE THOSE PILOTS TO

01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:16.151
FLY OUR PLANES --

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:17.853
AS WE MOVE INTO --

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.089
THE THE C. --

01:09:20.155 --> 01:09:20.956
ONE THIRTY RR --

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:23.359
WE HAVE THAT LARGE AIR TANKERS --

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:24.894
PART OF WHAT'S IN THE PROPOSED

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.329
BUDGET -- IS

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:28.731
A PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW THOSE

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:31.901
PILOTS HEAD OF GETTING THE

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:34.003
AIRCRAFT THAT ARE HERE AND READY

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.137
TO FLY SO.

01:09:35.204 --> 01:09:36.472
SO THE MINUTE WE HAVE THE

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:37.907
AIRCRAFT --

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.742
THAT IS OUTFITTED AND READY TO

01:09:39.808 --> 01:09:41.110
DROP RETARDANT.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.311
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.579
IMMEDIATELY PUT THE PILOTS ON

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.381
THAT AND FLY THOSE THOSE SHIPS

01:09:45.447 --> 01:09:46.582
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.618
AN EXTENDED TRAINING PERIOD --

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:50.986
TO THAT WOULD KEEP THOSE FROM

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:53.055
FLYING MISSIONS DURING THAT

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:54.290
PERIOD.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.558
OKAY SO I HAVE TO FOLLOW UPS IF

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:57.426
I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN --

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:58.761
LET'S GO WITH THE LAST THING

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.462
WITH REAL RELATING TO THE AIR

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:01.830
TANKERS --

01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.699
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRAINING

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:06.068
YOU KNOW OUR OWN PERSONNEL BUT

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.770
OR ARE YOU WE STILL CONTRACTING

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.071
OUT.

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:09.905
WITH THAT BECAUSE I KNOW FOR

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.407
INSTANCE IN THE CITY THAT I LIVE

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:13.375
IN LAKE ELSINORE WE HAVE MANY

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.010
TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR SEEN THE

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:16.478
BIG TANKER COMMAND.

01:10:16.545 --> 01:10:18.414
AND YOU KNOW PHILIP IN THE LAKE

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.583
IN AND GO OUT THERE SO ARE WE

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:21.984
STILL DOING THAT I BELIEVE ONE

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:23.619
OF THE COMPANIES WAS EVEN BASED

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:24.987
OUT OF CANADA I THINK.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:26.455
THAT WOULD BE --

01:10:26.522 --> 01:10:27.823
SUPER SCOOPER STAMP --

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.592
AND THEY THEY FILL WITH WATER

01:10:29.658 --> 01:10:31.827
THEY DROP WATER LIKE HELICOPTERS

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:34.330
DROP WATER NOT THE RED STUFF.

01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:36.198
THE WATER --

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:40.002
THAT IS NOT SO EIGHT DOES --

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:42.371
ON A ROUTINE BASIS WE DO ON

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:44.640
OCCASION HIGHER --

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:46.208
THOSE THOSE THOSE TYPE OF AIR

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:47.276
TANKERS --

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:48.677
LA COUNTY.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.046
DOES ANNUALLY AND THE FOREST

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.381
SERVICE HAS BEEN ANNUALLY OKAY

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.483
SO YOU GUYS TYPICALLY DON'T DO

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.451
THAT IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:10:55.517 --> 01:10:57.820
COST BURDEN HERE JUST IT'S JUST

01:10:57.886 --> 01:10:59.288
NOT PARTY HERE.

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:00.623
IT'S IT'S TYPICALLY ONE WHERE

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:02.124
WHAT WHEN WHERE UTILIZING --

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:04.393
FIXED WING AIRCRAFT WE WANT

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.462
RETARDANT ON THE GROUND THEY

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.130
DON'T DROP RETARDANT.

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:09.732
IS A OF A PERSISTENT LONG

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:12.334
LASTING APPLICATION TO THE THE

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.736
THE FUELS.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.605
WHERE WATER ONCE IT DISSIPATES

01:11:16.672 --> 01:11:17.873
COURSE IT'S WATER?

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.341
OKAY AND THEN JUST TO FALL JUST

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.143

SO I'M NOT.

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:18.593
GO AHEAD WELL I GUESS ONE OF

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.162
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I MAKE

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:21.530
IT A PERFECT WORLD BOB AND THIS

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:22.097
ONE OF THE THINGS WERE WERE

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.899
TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS HIS IS

01:18:23.965 --> 01:18:25.367
LEVERAGING ALL OF THAT WE WE

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.969
HAVE ACCESS. TO MANY OF THE

01:18:28.036 --> 01:18:29.071
CAMERA SYSTEM WE DON'T HAVE THAT

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.039
STORY ACCESS TO THE INDIVIDUAL

01:18:31.106 --> 01:18:32.040
UTILITIES.

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:34.409
DATA THAT IS COMING FORWARD AND

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:36.578
THAT IS. ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.747
TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS.

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.849
TO YOU KNOW MUCH LIKE WE HAVE

01:18:40.916 --> 01:18:43.251
AND I GOT I MENTIONED BEFORE ARE

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.120
DATA COMING IN FOR MULTIPLE

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.421
DIFFERENT SOURCES THEN THEN THEN

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.390
OF COURSE YOU NEED ANALYSTS TO

01:18:48.457 --> 01:18:50.225
BE ABLE --

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:51.093
TO YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND THE DATA

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.360
THAT YOU'RE SEEING AND AND PUT

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.728
IT IN THE ANALYTICS SO THAT WE

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:54.629
CAN HAVE.

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:55.931
THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ON

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:57.299
THAT YOU KNOW BECAUSE OTHERWISE

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:58.633
YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT A LOT OF

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.435
A LOT OF STUFF COMING IN SO --

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.571
BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT WE HAVE

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.172
ACCESS TO SOME THINGS WE DON'T

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.741
HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THEM --

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:07.742
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:08.210
TO GET.

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:12.214
TO THEM ONE FINAL QUESTION.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.148

THEY HAVE WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:23.792
WHETHER IT'S A RETARDANT OR

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.894
WHETHER IT'S A FIRST ALERT

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:41.263
FAMILIES THAT --

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:42.964
LOSS -- OF

01:21:43.031 --> 01:21:45.066
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THERE WERE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:45.667
SO DEVASTATED BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.534
FIRES.

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:49.337
I'D LIKE TO MENTION THE THE FACT

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:52.841
THAT EXACT IN NOVEMBER WE HAD

01:21:52.907 --> 01:21:53.808
ONE OF THE DEADLIEST --

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.543
DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN CALIFORNIA

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:58.580
WITH EIGHTY FIVE DEATHS AND A

01:21:58.647 --> 01:21:59.881
HUNDRED NINETY FIVE STRUCTURES.

01:21:59.948 --> 01:22:04.152
AND IN ALSO IN JUNE WE HAD --

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:04.653
ONE OF THE LARGEST AGAIN

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:05.787
MENDOCINO.

01:22:05.854 --> 01:22:07.956
COUNTY THAT LOS FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:09.157
SIXTY ACRES.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.059
AND THE REASON I BRING THAT UP

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.794
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ELEVEN

01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:14.229
MILLION CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.797
WITHIN THE WILDLAND.

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:19.267
URBAN INTERFACE AND SO THAT

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:20.468
TELLS ME THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

01:22:20.535 --> 01:22:20.769
SOMETHING.

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:24.072
RIGHT HERE BECAUSE 95% OF THE

01:22:24.139 --> 01:22:26.107
FIRES THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE MAN

01:22:26.174 --> 01:22:28.777
MADE MAN CAUSED AND YOU KNOW

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:31.079
SUCH THINGS AS THE LAWN MORE

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:32.080
DURABLE --

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:34.683
BUT WHETHER BE TARGET PRACTICE

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:35.917
FIRE [inaudible]

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:39.154
CAMPFIRE MIGHT BE.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.722
BUT I THINK WE'RE WHAT I'M NOT

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:43.925
HEARING IS A PROGRAM TO GET TO

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:45.727

RELATIONS PROGRAM.

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:50.265
YOU KNOW ASKING FOR A FEW

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.267
MILLION DOLLARS AS AN EXAMPLE

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:53.835
FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS PUBLIC

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.137
RELATIONS SOMEWHERE JUST BLASTED

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:57.305
ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:59.274
WHEN IT'S FIRE SEASON ALL OF US

01:22:59.341 --> 01:23:00.775
HAVE GOT TO PARTICIPATE?

01:23:00.842 --> 01:23:02.577
WHEN YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.078
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:04.612
CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD LOVE TO

BUT WE'VE GOT TO TELL THEM THAT

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:10.752
IT'S US.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:14.022

TO BE AWARE OF IT SOUL.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.794
OF FIRE PREVENTION I THINK IS

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:21.896
THE KEY BUT THE PLEASE ALL

01:23:21.963 --> 01:23:23.098

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:29.904
AWARENESS.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.639

BUT OBVIOUSLY NOTHING MORE

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:39.714
PRECIOUS THAN THE HUMAN LIFE

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:40.915
ITSELF.

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:45.620

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:36.658
FIXED WING --

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:39.427
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE.

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.429
CURRENTLY EQUIPPED TO DO --

01:26:41.496 --> 01:26:42.964
NOR -- THE

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:46.000
DO WE HAVE A NEAR TERM PLAN TO

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:48.236
DO THAT.

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:50.405
WITH THE CAL FIRE FLEET.

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.973
HOW EFFECTIVE --

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.442
OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN FCP

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:57.278
AS IT RELATES TO DROPPING IN

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:57.879
DIAPERS IS DROPPING DURING THE

01:26:57.946 --> 01:26:59.547
DAY.

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.516
SPENT TIME ON FIRES WE'RE WE'RE

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:03.384
BOTH HAVE OCCURRED --

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:05.887
NIGHT AND AND DAY --

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:06.821
WHAT?

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.423
WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE KIND OF A

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:09.457
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:13.661
YOU LOOK AT FOR USE OF OF --

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:15.863
DROPPING OF WATER AT NIGHT --

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:18.166
LIFE SAFETY --

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:20.468
IF YOU ARE IN A ENVIRONMENT

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:22.203
WHERE YOU'RE IN THIS KIND OF A

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:24.005
CITY TYPE OF A SITUATION OR

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.774
CLOSE -- TO

01:27:26.841 --> 01:27:29.010
LET'S JUST SAY A SCREWBALL WHICH

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:30.812
WAS A FIRE THAT HAPPENED LAST

01:27:30.878 --> 01:27:33.014
YEAR WHERE YOU CAN YOU CAN DROP

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:34.349
WATER -- AND

01:27:34.415 --> 01:27:36.484
WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.486
HAVING AN EFFECT --

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:39.854
THAT'S HELPFUL.

01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:41.255
IF YOU CAN SEE THAT YOU ARE

01:27:41.322 --> 01:27:43.791
DIRECTLY SUPPORTING --

01:27:43.858 --> 01:27:46.461
TROOPS ON THE GROUND OR TO DO

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:48.796
SOMETHING THAT'S HELPFUL.

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.098
IF YOU'RE JUST DROPPING WATER

01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.300
OUT ON FIRE LINE SOMEWHERE ON A

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.635
HILLSIDE --

01:27:53.701 --> 01:27:55.570
AND THERE'S NO GROUND RESOURCES

01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:57.171
TO DEAL WITH IT --

01:27:57.238 --> 01:27:58.906
THERE IS THERE IT WILL SLOW THE

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.575
PROGRESSION OF THE FIRE A LITTLE

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:01.309
BIT.

01:28:01.376 --> 01:28:02.677
BUT FIRE STILL GOING TO BE THERE

01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:03.745
IN THE MORNING.

01:28:03.811 --> 01:28:07.682
AND IT'S NOT PUTTING FIRE OUT SO

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:09.517
SO THE THE IT'S IT'S A TACTICAL

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.886
TOOL AND IT REALLY FOR US IS

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:13.755
SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT A LIFE

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.690
SAFETY OR MEDIA --

01:28:15.757 --> 01:28:18.092
PROPERTY OF PROTECTION KIND OF A

01:28:18.159 --> 01:28:19.160
MEASURE.

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:20.261
AND WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE RIGHT

01:28:20.328 --> 01:28:21.529
THERE ON THE GROUND TO TAKE CARE

01:28:21.596 --> 01:28:24.932
OF WHAT THEY NEED TO ON THE

01:28:24.999 --> 01:28:27.268
GROUND ONCE THE DROP.

01:28:27.335 --> 01:28:28.569
THE DRUDGE STATE YOU CORRECTED

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:31.472
THE DIVISIONAL.

01:28:31.539 --> 01:28:32.840
QUICKLY COMING ONLINE.

01:28:32.907 --> 01:28:34.142
WILL INCREASE OUR ABILITIES THIS

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:35.276
AREA.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:35.877
CORRECT IT WILL INCREASE OUR

01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:37.378
ABILITIES TO DO THAT FROM THE

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:39.380
CAL FIRE PERSPECTIVE WE ALREADY

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.481
HAVE PARTNERS THAT HAVE THAT

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.517
CAPABILITY AND WE UTILIZE THAT

01:28:42.583 --> 01:28:44.819
CAPABILITY WHEN THOSE SHIPS ARE

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:45.653
AVAILABLE.

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.388
AND THEY HAVE SEEN THE THE THE

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.457
MISSION DURING THE DAY AND ARE

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.059
ABLE TO FLY THAT.

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:52.627
AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION AND

01:28:52.694 --> 01:28:54.028
EITHER OF THE DIRECTORS MIGHT

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.430
TAKE THIS IS.

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:56.064
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:57.699
ADDITIONAL I THINK WAS FIVE

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:59.400
MILLION DOLLARS?

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:04.539
IN THE BUDGET --

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.606
FOR CAN SOMEBODY PUT THAT IN

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:07.108
CONTEXT FOR ME YOU KNOW WHAT'S

01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.910
OUR CAPABILITY NOW WHAT IS FIVE

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:10.678
MILLION DOLLARS GET US WHAT IS A

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.380
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GET US

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:14.515
WHAT IS THE WHAT YOU KNOW IN A

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.584
PERFECT WORLD HOW MANY CAMERAS

01:29:16.651 --> 01:29:18.686
MIGHT WE HAVE.

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:20.288
IT IS THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION --

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.256
I I CAN'T TALK TO THE PERFECT

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:24.559
WORLD -- I

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:25.093
CAN TALK TO WE'VE ALL BEEN

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:27.595
TRYING.

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.597
WHAT I CAN TALK TO IS --

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.265
WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY

01:29:31.332 --> 01:29:32.700
FIVE CAMERAS THAT WE CURRENTLY

01:29:32.767 --> 01:29:34.869
UTILIZE --

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:35.937
AND SO.

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:38.740
WE MOST OF THOSE ARE IN SOUTHERN

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:39.741
CALIFORNIA THE HIGHEST

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:41.776
SATURATION IS IN IN SOUTHERN

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:43.678
CALIFORNIA AND THEN AS YOU AS

01:29:43.745 --> 01:29:44.946
YOU MOVE NORTH GETS LESS.

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:46.380
MORE AROUND SOME OF THE PUBLIC

01:29:46.447 --> 01:29:48.049
POPULATED AREAS LESS WHEN YOU

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:51.085
GET OUT INTO THE THE MORE REMOTE

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.353
LANDSCAPE.

01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.589
WE THIS HUNDRED CAMERAS BECAUSE

01:29:54.655 --> 01:29:55.857
THAT THE FOR THAT FIVE POINT TWO

01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:58.459
MILLION DOLLARS POINTS --

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.461
TO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL CAMERAS --

01:30:00.528 --> 01:30:03.898
AND SO THAT WILL MORE THE NUMBER

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.933
OF CAMERAS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.635
AT AND SPREAD THEM ACROSS THE

01:30:07.702 --> 01:30:08.936
REST OF THE STATE WHETHER IT'S

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.706
ENOUGH -- I

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:13.574
CANNOT SAY WE'LL HAVE TO DEPLOY

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.942
IT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN

01:30:15.009 --> 01:30:16.043
DEPLOY.

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:18.012
AND WE HAVE LOCATIONS TO DEPLOY

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.080
WITHOUT.

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.149
BUILDING NEW --

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:23.684
SITES TO DEPLOY THEM.

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:24.685
OKAY THANK YOU.

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.154
THE OTHER QUESTIONS --

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.789
CENTER BRADFORD THEM CLOSER

01:30:27.855 --> 01:30:29.757
GALGIANI SHOULD QUICK QUESTION

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.797
OUR RADIUS.

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.532
I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK IT HAS

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:39.300
CHANGED RECENTLY --

01:30:39.367 --> 01:30:41.969
IT IS IT IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:43.137
IT'S TWO DOLLARS.

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:46.607
A DAY.

01:30:46.674 --> 01:30:47.608
AND THEN WE PAY --

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:52.213
ON FIRES ADDITIONAL TO THAT.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.314
SO WE'VE WAITED.

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.650

01:30:55.716 --> 01:30:57.185
AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.920
OF REASSESSING THAT AND AND IT'S

IMAGES OF CO. TWO ONE AVERAGE

01:38:00.507 --> 01:38:02.176
SIZE FIRE.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.311
A RACES ALL THE GAINS OF CAP AND

01:38:04.378 --> 01:38:05.946

SO HERE THIS HERE IS MILLION

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:18.259
METRIC TONS OF CO TWO EQUIVALENT.

01:38:18.325 --> 01:38:21.462
LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA IS TWENTY

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:23.297
TRADE WE REDUCED OUR CARBON

01:38:23.364 --> 01:38:26.066
EMISSIONS FROM POWER PLANTS CARS

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:28.335
SO ONE BY ONE HALF MILLION

01:38:28.402 --> 01:38:29.570
METRIC TONS.

EIGHT MILLION TONS OF CO.

01:38:39.346 --> 01:38:40.748
TWO THAT ONE FIRE.

THIRTEEN ALMOST A REDUCTION OF

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.925
FOUR MILLION METRIC TONS.

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:53.460
BUT HERE IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIM

MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARMEN.

01:39:04.338 --> 01:39:05.239
THESE ESTIMATES OF FROM THE

HOW PRECISE THEY ARE.

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:11.745
BUT WE NEED TO TAKE THIS INTO

FIRES HOW IT'S CHANGING IN REAL

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:23.450
TIME.

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.386
OKAY DURING EXPLOSIVE FIRE

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:27.788
BEHAVIOR WE'RE WE'RE JUST

01:40:27.855 --> 01:40:29.923

THAT INCIPIENT.

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.798
FIRE -- MODE --

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:40.901
TIME AND AFTER CONTAINMENT.

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:43.137
RECONDITION THE HOLY FIRE IN

01:40:43.203 --> 01:40:45.539
ELSINORE REIGNITED ALMOST IN THE

SAME PLACE A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:48.675
INITIAL BURN.

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.444
QUE AND WE WERE ABLE TO CATCH IT

01:40:50.511 --> 01:40:52.479
EARLY ON THESE CAMERAS.

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.715
SO THIS YEAR'S THE WALL FIRE WE

01:40:54.782 --> 01:40:56.383

ALABAMA IT TAKES HOUSES OFF

01:41:15.736 --> 01:41:18.806
THEIR PLATFORMS IT MOVES CARS.

01:41:18.872 --> 01:41:20.474
CASE OF THIS IS ANOTHER THING

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:21.408

LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DYNAMICS

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:38.725
THE ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS OF FIRE.

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.427
OKAY SO HERE THIS SITUATION

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.563

GIGAHERTZ.

01:42:34.882 --> 01:42:36.416
THIS IS A COMBINED FIRE AND

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.818
EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SO WE

01:42:37.885 --> 01:42:40.254
HAVE A STRONG MOTION SENSOR ON

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.055

01:53:42.382 --> 01:53:42.815
BACKGROUND IS REALLY IN

01:53:42.882 --> 01:53:43.683
METEOROLOGY AND SO THE FIRE

01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:44.684
WEATHER RESEARCH LAB IS THE ONLY

01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:45.218
ACADEMIC PROGRAM IN UNITED

01:53:45.285 --> 01:53:46.286
STATES FOCUSED ON FIRE WEATHER

01:53:46.352 --> 01:53:47.720
RESEARCH --

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:49.989
WE TEACH ONE OF ONLY TWO CLASSES

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:50.590
AND FIRE WEATHER AS SOON AS A

01:53:50.657 --> 01:53:51.558
STATE.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.459
AND SO OUR RESEARCH IS IN FIRE

01:53:53.526 --> 01:53:55.161
WEATHER FIRE DANGER AND SUCH SO

01:53:55.228 --> 01:53:56.696
I JUST WANT TO KIND OF CLICK

01:53:56.763 --> 01:53:59.332
THROUGH A FEW THINGS REAL QUICK.

01:53:59.399 --> 01:53:59.899
AS WE KNOW THE FIRE BEHAVIOR

01:53:59.966 --> 01:54:00.967
TRIANGLE.

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:02.235
EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR IS A

01:54:02.302 --> 01:54:02.802
FUNCTION OF FUELS THE STUFF

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:04.204
THAT'S BURNING THE TOPOGRAPHY

01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.072
AND THE WEATHER AND THE WEATHER

01:54:06.139 --> 01:54:07.307
IS THE MOST VARIABLE AND SO IT'S

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.708
SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:11.077
GET A HANDLE ON AND SO --

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:13.880
WHAT I WANT TO STRESS TODAY IS

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:14.948
WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW

01:54:15.014 --> 01:54:16.816
NETWORKS EVERYBODY'S PUTTING OUT

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:18.751
MORE WEATHER STATIONS?

01:54:18.818 --> 01:54:19.819
THESE ARE THE SERVICE NETWORKS

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:22.121
THE DOTS ON THE MAP THERE ARE

01:54:22.188 --> 01:54:23.723
ALL THE WEATHER STATIONS THE POT

01:54:23.790 --> 01:54:25.758
OR THE PUBLIC OWNED WEATHER

01:54:25.825 --> 01:54:26.926
STATIONS.

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:31.731
IN THE STATE AND PROVIDE REAL

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:34.033
TIME DATA BUT IT'S GENERALLY

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:35.935
HOURLY SOMETIMES FIFTEEN MINUTE.

01:54:36.002 --> 01:54:37.870
IT'S REALLY THOSE DATA ARE USED

01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:39.239
FOR FIRE DANGER RATINGS SO IF

01:54:39.305 --> 01:54:40.440
YOU SEE SMOKEY THE BEAR AT A

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.575
PARK IN HIS HANDIS UP HIGH.

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:44.444
POINTING TO HIGH FIRE DANGER

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:45.945
THOSE DATA ARE WHAT MAKE THAT

01:54:46.012 --> 01:54:47.180
CALCULATION.

01:54:47.247 --> 01:54:48.314
AND SO.

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:49.549
THE PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:50.683
NETWORK WHICH IS REALLY

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:51.818
IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY GREAT TO

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:53.419
HAPPEN WE REALLY NEED IT FAR

01:54:53.486 --> 01:54:54.921
WHETHER BEHAVIOR MODELS IS THAT.

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:57.156
IT DOESN'T CAPTURE THESE EXTREME

01:54:57.223 --> 01:54:58.124
EVENTS WERE THE WILD FIRES

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.425
CREATE THEIR OWN WHETHER WE

01:54:59.492 --> 01:55:00.893
STILL DON'T HAVE A GOOD

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:02.295
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT IS.

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.162
AND SO --

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:05.198
THIS IS A ACTUAL SIMULATION

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:07.867
USING A COUPLE AND I JUST WANNA

01:55:07.934 --> 01:55:09.402
CLICK TO SHOW YOU KIND OF THE

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:10.903
IT'S MOVING BUT THE STATE OF THE

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:13.573
SCIENCE OF FIRE WEATHER MODELING

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.874
IS A COUPLED MODEL.

01:55:14.941 --> 01:55:16.576
IT'S WHERE THE FIRE IS DRIVEN BY

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:17.944
THE WEATHER AND THEN THE FIRE

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:19.812
ACTUALLY PUTS ITS HEAT INTO THE

01:55:19.879 --> 01:55:20.847
WEATHER MODEL AND SO IT'S

01:55:20.913 --> 01:55:22.148
COUPLED AND THAT'S KIND OF THE

01:55:22.215 --> 01:55:23.082
STATE OF THE SCIENCE THE

01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:24.851
COMPUTATIONALLY IS VERY HIGH.

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:26.886
BUT WE CAN DRIVE THOSE MODELS

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:30.056
AND SO IF WE SKEWS ME ASK DOT.

01:55:30.123 --> 01:55:31.291
THIS IS THE SAME MODEL

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:33.493
SIMULATING THE TUBS FIRE THIS IS

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:34.327
MY STUDENTS WORK --

01:55:34.394 --> 01:55:36.629
THE NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE

01:55:36.696 --> 01:55:38.831
WINDS DURING THE TUBS FIRE AND

01:55:38.898 --> 01:55:40.500
WHAT YOU SEE AND ONLY USES

01:55:40.566 --> 01:55:42.235
POINTER HERE.

01:55:42.302 --> 01:55:43.436
THIS IS NOT SAY HALINA THIS IS --

01:55:43.503 --> 01:55:44.237
THIS COFFEE PARK AND THE REDS

01:55:44.304 --> 01:55:47.907
ARE NGUYEN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:48.875
AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S CALLED A

01:55:48.941 --> 01:55:50.343
HYDRAULIC JUMP.

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:51.944
AND THAT'S EXTREME WHEN.

01:55:52.011 --> 01:55:53.479
SURFACING AND WHERE THE

01:55:53.546 --> 01:55:56.115
HYDRAULIC JUMP DIES LANDS.

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.250
DETERMINES IF IT CAN BE REALLY

01:55:57.317 --> 01:55:58.751
REALLY WINDY OR NOT AND SO WE

01:55:58.818 --> 01:55:59.552
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.421
STRUCTURE WE CAN'T MEASURE THE

01:56:01.487 --> 01:56:01.954
VERTICAL STRUCTURE IN THE

01:56:02.021 --> 01:56:03.489
ATMOSPHERE.

01:56:03.556 --> 01:56:04.891
AND AS A RESPONSE AND I JUST

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:05.425
WANNA SKIP TO THE SO WHAT

01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:06.626
HAPPENS IS.

01:56:06.693 --> 01:56:08.394
THE WINDS MOVE FROM A LAW AFTER

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:09.462
UP ABOVE IN THE HIGHER PART

01:56:09.529 --> 01:56:11.764
ATMOSPHERE TO THE SURFACE REALLY

01:56:11.831 --> 01:56:12.198
RAPIDLY.

01:56:12.265 --> 01:56:13.232
AND SO.

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:14.400
WE DON'T MEASURE THAT WITH

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:16.836
WEATHER STATIONS RIGHT NOW SO WE

01:56:16.903 --> 01:56:18.338
DEVELOPED A MOBILE AT MR

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:20.606
PROFILING SYSTEM THAT WE TAKE A

01:56:20.673 --> 01:56:22.475
WILD FIRES --

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:23.509
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INSURANCE ON

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:25.011
IT I WANT TO CLICK THROUGH WITH

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:26.846
TALK ABOUT A DOPPLER LASER RADAR

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:27.980
THIS RONA GET.

01:56:28.047 --> 01:56:29.282
TO THIS INSTRUMENT CAN ACTUALLY

01:56:29.349 --> 01:56:32.118
MEASURE PLUMES AND REAL TIME ON

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:32.985
A FIRE [inaudible]

01:56:33.052 --> 01:56:35.822
SO THAT'S DEL PATEL FIRE PLUME

01:56:35.888 --> 01:56:37.957
WE CAN ACTUALLY PROPUBLICA LIKE

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:39.625
X. RAY INSIDE THE FIRE AND WE

01:56:39.692 --> 01:56:41.227
CAN MEASURE THE WINDS INSIDE THE

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:41.961
FIRE.

01:56:42.028 --> 01:56:43.563
AND SO WE WERE THE ONLY --

01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:45.331
ME LOGICAL TEAM IN THE U. S.

01:56:45.398 --> 01:56:46.666
THAT'S FIRE LONG QUALIFIED.

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.601
AND SO WE OF ACCESS TO GET TO

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:49.902
THE FIRES OR A NATIONAL RESOURCE

01:56:49.969 --> 01:56:52.372
WE GET REQUESTED INCIDENTS AS

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:53.306
WELL.

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:54.474
AND SO SEE HERE.

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.942
THIS IS THE CAMPFIRE WE DEPLOYED

01:56:56.008 --> 01:56:57.777
TO THE CAMPFIRE WHEN IT IGNITED

01:56:57.844 --> 01:56:59.078
AND WHAT YOU SEE.

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.113
IS THAT THE WINDS ARE REALLY

01:57:00.179 --> 01:57:01.814
STRONG ALOFT WELL ABOVE THE

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:02.682
GROUND BUT THEY'RE NOT VERY

01:57:02.749 --> 01:57:05.418
STRONG NEAR THE SURFACE EVEN

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:06.319
THOUGH THEY WERE.

01:57:06.386 --> 01:57:07.320
BUT THEY WEREN'T STRONG AND SO

01:57:07.387 --> 01:57:08.488
WHAT WE CAN WHAT WITH THE

01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:10.323
LIGHTER ALLOWS US TO DO IS LOOK

01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:11.391
AT THE VERTICAL STRUCTURE OF THE

01:57:11.457 --> 01:57:12.992
PLUME AND WHERE WE CAN'T WITH

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:16.129
THE SERVICE NETWORK.

01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:17.196
WE ALSO FLEW AN AIRPLANE TO A

01:57:17.263 --> 01:57:18.865
MAJOR FIRE ICE WHEN I HIGHLIGHT

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:19.532
THE RADAR.

01:57:19.599 --> 01:57:21.134
THE LIGHT OR IS REALLY GOOD IT'S

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.735
A LASER BEAM THAT WE SIGNED INTO

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:25.037
THE FIRE BUT WITH THE RADAR WE

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.706
CAN ACTUALLY MEASURE BIG DEEP

01:57:26.773 --> 01:57:28.141
COLUMNS BIG --

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:32.044
FOR PLUME DRIVEN FIRES AND SO F. --

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:33.579
AIRCRAFT WE FLEW IT THROUGH A

01:57:33.646 --> 01:57:36.115
FIRE AND AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:37.750
WE REALIZE THE DATE ARE SO GOOD

01:57:37.817 --> 01:57:39.652
THAT WE REQUESTED A GREAT WE

01:57:39.719 --> 01:57:40.853
PLAYED FOR A GRANT.

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.822
AND WE NOW HAVE THE ONLY MOBILE

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:44.590
RADAR IN THE WESTERN US IT IS

01:57:44.657 --> 01:57:46.058
THE ONLY RATE ARE ON THE U. S.

01:57:46.125 --> 01:57:47.960
TUNE FOR WILDFIRE RESEARCH.

01:57:48.027 --> 01:57:49.128
IT'S A SPECIAL K. BEYOND ALLOWS

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.563
US TO LOOK AT PARTICLES AND THE

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:52.832
IDEA IS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:54.300
ACTUALLY SEE EMBERS BEING

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:55.835
TRANSPORTED IN THE PLUMES OF

01:57:55.902 --> 01:57:57.503
WHERE THEY MAY FALL.

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.471
AND SO THIS --

01:57:58.538 --> 01:58:00.206
READER BE DELIVERED AND APRIL

01:58:00.273 --> 01:58:02.775
AND SO WE'LL HAVE IT TESTED BY

01:58:02.842 --> 01:58:03.976
THE FIRE SEASON SO GIVE US TO

01:58:04.043 --> 01:58:05.511
MOBILE ASSETS --

01:58:05.578 --> 01:58:06.145
I'M GONNA KIND OF SKIP TO HEAR

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:07.413
BUT WHAT WE'VE ALSO DONE IS

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:09.182
WE'VE PUT A INFRARED CAMERA

01:58:09.248 --> 01:58:10.783
SYSTEM VERY SMALL AND ON THE

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.151
SAME AIRCRAFT.

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:12.919
AND WE'RE GONNA BRING THAT

01:58:12.985 --> 01:58:14.353
AIRCRAFT TO CALIFORNIA PLACE IN

01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:15.955
READING AND TWENTY TWENTY IF WE

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:17.156
GET THE FUNDING.

01:58:17.223 --> 01:58:18.658
AND THAT'LL ALLOW US TO DO HIGH

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:19.625
RESOLUTION WE'RE TALKING TWO

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:21.994
METER SIX FOOT RESOLUTION MUCH

01:58:22.061 --> 01:58:23.563
HIGHER THAN SATELLITE.

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:26.666
AND ONE SECOND --

01:58:26.732 --> 01:58:30.136
DATA THE WHOLE FIRE AND THE

01:58:30.203 --> 01:58:32.505
DINNER TRAY A COMPUTER HAND HELD

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:36.409
OR ON THE FIRE LINE AND SO.

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.910
GETTING TO THE POINT WE ACTUALLY

01:58:37.977 --> 01:58:40.213
HAVE THE ASSETS WE HAVE THE

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:41.347
PLATFORMS WE CAN PUT THIS

01:58:41.414 --> 01:58:43.916
TECHNOLOGY ON AND SO IF YOU

01:58:43.983 --> 01:58:45.051
COULD YOU COULD PUT THIS ON AIR

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:46.319
TACTICAL AIRCRAFT THAT THE ONES

01:58:46.385 --> 01:58:47.620
THAT FLY ABOVE AN INCIDENT THAT

01:58:47.687 --> 01:58:50.189
MANAGE THE SUPPRESSION AIRCRAFT.

01:58:50.256 --> 01:58:50.823
AND THEN YOU CAN MAP IT OUT IN

01:58:50.890 --> 01:58:52.492
REAL TIME AND THE DATA

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:53.893
TRANSMITTED VIA SATELLITE.

01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:56.596
SIMILARLY YOU CAN TAKE A TANKER.

01:58:56.662 --> 01:58:57.396
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.465
MANUFACTURER WITH THE NET DATA

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:01.133
PROBE THE THIS NEW LOGICAL

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.302
SENSOR CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE

01:59:03.369 --> 01:59:05.037
NEUROLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS IN

01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:08.040
REAL TIME ON ACTIVE WILDFIRE.

01:59:08.107 --> 01:59:09.542
FASTER THAN A WEATHER STATION

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:10.643
AND ALL THESE DATA ARE

01:59:10.710 --> 01:59:12.445
TRANSMITTED SATELLITE SO WE GET

01:59:12.512 --> 01:59:13.813
TURBULENCE IN ADDITION.

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.214
THAT SENSOR PACKAGE GIVES YOU

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:17.350
AIRFRAME STRAIN AND SIZE ONCE

01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:19.285
GET THROUGH HERE AND FINALLY GET

01:59:19.352 --> 01:59:21.320
TO THIS LAST SLIDE.

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:22.822
A NETWORK OF VERTICAL PURFLING

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:24.357
RADAR LEASE RADARS ARE LIGHT

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.058
OURS THIS IS SOMETHING WE DO NOT

01:59:26.125 --> 01:59:28.160
HAVE IN THE STATE THESE DOTS OF

01:59:28.227 --> 01:59:28.995
THESE LEGAL.

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.530
OR SUGGESTED LOCATIONS WHERE I

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:31.964
WOULD PUT THESE.

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:32.832
WE DO MAYBE DO THE EIGHTY

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:34.233
CORRIDOR WE DO THE NORTH BAY WE

01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.335
DO LA BASIN AND THESE CAN

01:59:36.402 --> 01:59:37.436
ACTUALLY DETECT SMOKE IN REAL

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:38.905
TIME THEY CAN ALSO MEASURE THE

01:59:38.971 --> 01:59:40.673
WINDOWS ARE COMING DOWN.

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:41.774
AND THEY'LL THAT ALL THAT DATA

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:43.843
IN JUST INTO A WILDFIRE --

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:45.745
PROJECTION SYSTEM AND SO JUST

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:46.913
YOUR SCHEMATIC YOU GET ALL THE

01:59:46.979 --> 01:59:48.447
DATA FROM THE AIRCRAFT TO GET IT

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:49.448
FROM THE MOBILE --

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:50.683
ASSETS AT SAN JOSE STATE IT GOES

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:52.285
INTO A SUPER COMPUTER IT SPITS

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:53.953
OUT THAT FIRE COUPLE MODELING

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:54.554
SYSTEM.

01:59:54.620 --> 02:00:00.226
AND THEN THOSE ASSETS SEE

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:00.860
HAPPENING WE'RE GONNA TEST THE

02:00:00.927 --> 02:00:02.361
RADAR THIS SUMMER AND WE'RE

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:03.696
GONNA HAVE THOSE MODEL OUTPUTS

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:05.665
ON OUR WEB SO WE'RE WE'RE DOING

02:00:05.731 --> 02:00:06.165
THIS NOW.

02:00:06.232 --> 02:00:07.333
BUT I THINK.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.834
THE MAIN GOAL IS THE MAIN POINT

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:10.002
I WANT TO MAKE TODAY'S THAT

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:11.637
THERE'S A LOT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.

02:00:11.704 --> 02:00:12.905
WE CAN PUT THIS ON OUR CURRENT

02:00:12.972 --> 02:00:14.907
AIRCRAFT AND WE CAN COLLECT MORE

02:00:14.974 --> 02:00:16.175
DATA SO WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT NEW

02:00:16.242 --> 02:00:18.210
ASSETS OUT IN THE FIELD THAT'S

02:00:18.277 --> 02:00:20.246
ALREADY THERE WE JUST HAVE --

02:00:20.313 --> 02:00:22.248
TO ADD AND TECHNOLOGY TO THEM.

02:00:22.315 --> 02:00:24.684
SO WITH THAT I'LL JUST.

02:00:24.750 --> 02:00:45.137
END. FIFTY SIX THANK YOU TO GO.

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.439
THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:48.474
THREE TO SPEAK --

02:00:48.541 --> 02:00:49.575
I'M OKAY OUT ON THURSDAY NIGHT

02:00:49.642 --> 02:00:51.010
OF PRESENT A NUMBER OF OF

02:00:51.077 --> 02:00:53.112
RESEARCHERS AT THE UC SAN DIEGO --

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:54.880
AND IT'S A PERFECT ACTION SICK

02:00:54.947 --> 02:00:58.584
VERY FROM SENSING AND CAMERAS

02:00:58.651 --> 02:01:03.055
AND BOTH NEAR AND REMOTE SENSING

02:01:03.122 --> 02:01:04.357
TO MODELING.

02:01:04.423 --> 02:01:05.524
AND AS YOU SEEN DURING A FIRE

02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:07.193
THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION

02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:08.227
GOING ON A STRONG THAT.

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:09.495
IN A WAY THE AGENCY IS FOR

02:01:09.562 --> 02:01:11.030
MONITORING OF THE FIRE WHICH I

02:01:11.097 --> 02:01:12.198
WILL CALL.

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:13.766
NOW CASTING.

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:16.068
AND HAVING THAT INFORMATION AND

02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:17.536
USING IT TO PREDICT THE FIRES

02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.639
BEHAVIOR ITS DIRECTION THAT IT'S

02:01:19.705 --> 02:01:21.407
GOING TO BE CAN HELP THE

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:23.142
DECISIONS RELATED TO IT WHICH IS

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:26.479
WHAT WE CALL FOR CASTING.

02:01:26.545 --> 02:01:28.247
SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:01:28.314 --> 02:01:31.017
WAYS FOR CASTING CAN BE DONE BUT

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:32.685
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY IS.

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:34.754
LINKING ALL THIS MODELING AND

02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.889
THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT DURING

02:01:36.956 --> 02:01:39.592
THE FIRES. TO WHAT I WITH COOL

02:01:39.659 --> 02:01:43.329
DISASTER INTEL INTELLIGENCE.

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:44.363
SO.

02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:47.466
THE SOLUTION HERE IS TO BUILD A

02:01:47.533 --> 02:01:49.201
AS CHAIRMAN DOT SAID A CLEARING

02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:50.770
HOUSE SO TO SAY THAT'S

02:01:50.836 --> 02:01:54.407
INTELLIGENT AND NEUTRAL.

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:56.242
SO IT'S NOT --

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:58.244
TRY WITH IN THE SENSE THAT THE

02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:59.178
BOND.

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:00.212
PARTY OWNS THE DATA.

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:01.580
AND INTEGRATE TO IT AS AN

02:02:01.647 --> 02:02:04.250
INFRASTRUCTURE TO CATALOG CURATE --

02:02:04.316 --> 02:02:05.117
EXCHANGE --

02:02:05.184 --> 02:02:06.519
ALLIES AND COMMUNICATE

02:02:06.585 --> 02:02:08.821
INFORMATION TO THE AGENCY IS TO

02:02:08.888 --> 02:02:11.090
THE SCIENCE COMMUNITY AND ALSO

02:02:11.157 --> 02:02:12.458
TO PUBLIC FOR PUBLIC EVER IN

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:13.592
THIS INSPIRATIONAL.

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:16.162
NEEDS THAT CAN ARISE AROUND FIVE

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:19.165
YEARS BEFORE AND AFTER FOR

02:02:19.231 --> 02:02:21.734
RESILIENCE --

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.302
SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:25.271
RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:26.539
NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AND

02:02:26.605 --> 02:02:28.140
OVER THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:29.308
YEARS WE'VE BEEN BUILDING

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:30.943
AUTOMATED WORKFLOWS TO COLLECT

02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:31.877
DATA.

02:02:31.944 --> 02:02:33.813
AND USE THEM FOR MONITORING

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:36.182
VISUALIZING AND PREDICTING FIRE

02:02:36.248 --> 02:02:38.217
BEHAVIOR IT'S CALLED THE WHY

02:02:38.284 --> 02:02:40.419
FIRE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THERE'S

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:42.088
A PHONE BECAUSE OF THAT I

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:45.524
DISTRIBUTES A HOPEFULLY IT WAS

02:02:45.591 --> 02:02:47.693
DISTRIBUTED DURING MY TALK --

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:49.562
SO THE IDEA IS COLLECT ALL THE

02:02:49.628 --> 02:02:52.198
DATA AND SERVICE IN A WAY THAT

02:02:52.264 --> 02:02:54.200
MODELS CAN INGEST.

02:02:54.266 --> 02:02:55.334
AND OF COURSE IS A PART OF OUR

02:02:55.401 --> 02:02:57.069
EFFORTS FEE BILL DYNAMIC DATA

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:58.804
DRIVEN FIRE MODELS FOR THREE MY

02:02:58.871 --> 02:02:59.772
TO BE COLD AND DYNAMIC DATA

02:02:59.839 --> 02:03:01.140
DRIVEN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST

02:03:01.207 --> 02:03:02.641
ABOUT MODELING IS GETTING THE

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:04.176
DATA IN REAL TIME.

02:03:04.243 --> 02:03:06.112
AND MAKING SURE WE CAN ADJUST

02:03:06.178 --> 02:03:07.546
THE MODELS.

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.448
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COME FROM THE

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:10.483
UPDATES.

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:13.619
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MONITOR AND

02:03:13.686 --> 02:03:17.189
CHANGE THE FIRE SEE IT IS BEING

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:19.325
FOUGHT HOW THE RAIDERS CHANGING

02:03:19.391 --> 02:03:20.893
LOCALLY AND GLOBALLY.

02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.863
AROUND THE FIRE AND HOLLOW.

02:03:23.929 --> 02:03:25.831
THE PERIMETER IS EVOLVING BUT

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:26.465
HOW BOUT EVACUATIONS HAVE BEEN

02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:28.601
DONE AND ALL THAT INFORMATION

02:03:28.667 --> 02:03:29.902
CAN BE SERVED THROUGH ONE

02:03:29.969 --> 02:03:32.271
PLATFORM. TO ANYONE WHO'S TRYING

02:03:32.338 --> 02:03:33.973
TO MODEL THE FIRES WAS TRYING TO

02:03:34.039 --> 02:03:36.175
MAKE DECISIONS.

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.843
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:38.744
SO THE FIRE ENOUGH TOOL IS THE

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:40.279
RESULT OF THIS THREE MILLION

02:03:40.346 --> 02:03:41.480
DOLLARS NATIONAL SCIENCE

02:03:41.547 --> 02:03:43.215
FOUNDATION SUPPORT THAT WE

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:44.517
DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:45.985
THE LA FIRE DEPARTMENT --

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:47.486
ME GOOD ADVICE FROM A NUMBER OF

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:50.022
DIFFERENT AGENCIES HUNDRED

02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.756
TWENTY SIX AGENCIES ACTUALLY

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:52.658
COLLABORATED WITH US TO

02:03:52.725 --> 02:03:54.160
UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:56.162
DOING IN RESEARCH MODE --

02:03:56.228 --> 02:03:57.363
OVER THE LAST YEAR BEAVER

02:03:57.429 --> 02:04:00.399
SUPPORT OF AN OPERATIONAL FORM

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:01.700
OF ID LA FIRE DEPARTMENT AWAY

02:04:01.767 --> 02:04:03.169
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT VENTURA

02:04:03.235 --> 02:04:04.837
COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT.

02:04:04.904 --> 02:04:09.408
AND SHE FANTASY MIGHT SPEAK

02:04:09.475 --> 02:04:10.042
LATER --

02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.609
ALSO THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:11.477
AUTHORITY.

02:04:11.544 --> 02:04:12.978
SO THIS IS A PLATFORM TO TAKE

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:14.513
ALL THAT DATA THAT COULD ANYONE

02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:17.650
CAN USE AND US US BOTH IN THE

02:04:17.716 --> 02:04:19.351
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THE MAIN.

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:20.186
PUT THE LAYER ON TOP OF IT TO

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:22.188
COMMUNICATE ENVIRONMENTAL DATA

02:04:22.254 --> 02:04:23.656
AND OTHER FIRE RELATED DATA

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:26.325
INFRASTRUCTURE CENSUS POPULATION

02:04:26.392 --> 02:04:28.627
SMOKE AIR QUALITY IN YOUR NAME

02:04:28.694 --> 02:04:31.197
AT ANY DATA THAT CAN RELATE. TO

02:04:31.263 --> 02:04:33.065
ALL HAZARDS IN NASA'S NOT JUST

02:04:33.132 --> 02:04:35.067
FIRED ABOUT THE USE THAT IN THE

02:04:35.134 --> 02:04:36.969
CONTEXT OF FIRE MODELING AND WE

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:39.438
HAVE OUR OWN FIRE BEHAVIOR

02:04:39.505 --> 02:04:40.706
MODELS THAT BE INTEGRATED BUT WE

02:04:40.773 --> 02:04:44.476
WOULD BE HAPPY TO INTEGRATE.

02:04:44.543 --> 02:04:46.445
ANY MODEL.

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:50.015
THAT OF THE STATE IS USING ARE

02:04:50.082 --> 02:04:51.851
WILLING TO USE IN THE LONG TERM.

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:54.453
SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE STARTED

02:04:54.520 --> 02:04:55.754
TO THINK ABOUT FIRE NOT TO GET --

02:04:55.821 --> 02:04:57.923
DURING THE TWO THOUSAND

02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.424
SEVENTEEN CAN ORDER IN

02:04:58.490 --> 02:04:59.458
CALIFORNIA FIRES.

02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:01.160
THIS INFO INFRASTRUCTURE TO WORK

02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:02.361
ON THIS GOT OUT OF COURSE WE

02:05:02.428 --> 02:05:04.396
DON'T MAKE THE FORECASTING OF

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:06.465
THE FIRE AVAILABLE TO PUBLIC.

02:05:06.532 --> 02:05:09.668
BUT THE REST OF SAID FRUSTRATION

02:05:09.735 --> 02:05:13.539
THE VENISON ON THE EIGHT HUNDRED

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:14.874
THOUSAND PUBLIC USERS ALONG WITH

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:16.475
THOSE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX

02:05:16.542 --> 02:05:19.111
FIRE AGENCIES GOT ON THE SITE.

02:05:19.178 --> 02:05:23.549
SO THAT SHOWS ALSO THE PUBLIC'S

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:25.417
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON AND

02:05:25.484 --> 02:05:27.386
DISINTEGRATES AS YOU SEEN SOME

02:05:27.453 --> 02:05:29.021
OF THE BETTER STATIONS THAT YOU

02:05:29.088 --> 02:05:30.756
SEE IN CAMERA DATA.

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:33.125
SMOKE PLUMES RED FLAG ALERTS.

02:05:33.192 --> 02:05:34.360
ANNOUNCED FIRE PERIMETERS

02:05:34.426 --> 02:05:36.128
DETECTIONS FROM SATELLITES AND

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:38.330
ANY OTHER INFORMATION WE CAN

02:05:38.397 --> 02:05:40.966
BRING. FOR SITUATION LIVE IN

02:05:41.033 --> 02:05:42.134
THIS.

02:05:42.201 --> 02:05:43.402
IT WAS ALSO USED IN SOME OF THE

02:05:43.469 --> 02:05:45.104
LA COUNTY FIRES LA ACTUALLY HAS

02:05:45.170 --> 02:05:47.106
A WORK FLOW MANDATE START TO

02:05:47.172 --> 02:05:48.073
MODELING THE MOMENT THEY RECEIVE

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.174
THE ALERTS.

02:05:49.241 --> 02:05:50.843
AND SOME OF THOSE ALERTS COME

02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:51.677
FROM FOR INSTANCE ALERT WELFARE

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:52.778
CAMERAS.

02:05:52.845 --> 02:05:55.514
YOU CAN EVEN GO TO A CAMERA AND

02:05:55.581 --> 02:05:57.683
WHICH ON THE SMOKE AND THAT

02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.718
INFORMATION GETS INGESTED INTO

02:05:59.785 --> 02:06:02.054
THE PLATFORM AND THE MODELING

02:06:02.121 --> 02:06:03.355
STARS FROM THEN ON SO IT CAN BE

02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:05.224
MADE IN A SEAMLESS FASHION USING

02:06:05.291 --> 02:06:07.059
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA

02:06:07.126 --> 02:06:08.661
SCIENCE TECHNIQUES THAT.

02:06:08.727 --> 02:06:10.262
THE MOMENT A FIRE IS DETECTED

02:06:10.329 --> 02:06:11.797
AUTOMATICALLY --

02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.732
IN MODEL CAN BE START IT CAN

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.734
EVEN BE DONE --

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:17.169
BUT NOT REALLY ON THE WERE

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:19.138
ADVISED BY T. FORDER ON THIS.

02:06:19.204 --> 02:06:20.572
THE DAY BEFORE TO FIRE REYES ON

02:06:20.639 --> 02:06:22.808
THOSE DANGER ALERTS BUT IF A

02:06:22.875 --> 02:06:29.448
FIRE HAPPENED HOW DO YOU --

02:06:29.515 --> 02:06:32.551
OKAY THREE SOURCES WHAT'S

02:06:32.618 --> 02:06:33.485
INITIALLY SAN DIEGO FIRE

02:06:33.552 --> 02:06:34.853
DEPARTMENT NOW ORANGE COUNTY

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:37.022
FIRE AUTHORITY AFTER CHIU

02:06:37.089 --> 02:06:38.924
FANTASIES MOVE THERE --

02:06:38.991 --> 02:06:39.959
THAT -- THE

02:06:40.025 --> 02:06:43.162
AIRCRAFT FROM GENERAL ATOMICS

02:06:43.228 --> 02:06:44.129
FLIES VERY ABOUT THE FIRE.

02:06:44.196 --> 02:06:48.000
SUPPRESSION OF FOR EFFORTS TO AT

02:06:48.067 --> 02:06:50.536
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FEET --

02:06:50.602 --> 02:06:51.904
THE DATA HE GOT --

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.372
AND THE THE SORT OF A RADAR AND

02:06:53.439 --> 02:06:54.773
OTHER INTERNET BASED SENSING

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:55.975
THAT'S EXTENSIBLE --

02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:57.876
THE PERIMETERS WE CAN GET PRETTY

02:06:57.943 --> 02:06:59.078
DETAILED PARAMETERS DURING A

02:06:59.144 --> 02:07:00.579
FIRE FROM THESE AIRCRAFT THAT

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:01.981
INFORMATION WE ARE USING TO

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:03.816
ASSIMILATE INTO FIRE MODELS SO

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:05.751
WE CAN CONSTANTLY GENERATE NEW

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.152
FIRE MODELS AND IN THE MODEL CAN

02:07:07.219 --> 02:07:11.123
BE GENERATED IN A MATTER OF

02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:11.357
MINUTES.

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:12.858
IS IT ACCURATE.

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.727
IT SCIENTIFICALLY THE ACCURACY

02:07:14.793 --> 02:07:16.328
CAN DID CHANGE BUT IS IT FAST

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:17.262
AND IT DOESN'T HELP WITH

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:18.497
DECISION SUPPORT YES IT DOES

02:07:18.564 --> 02:07:22.167
ABSOLUTELY A 100%.

02:07:22.234 --> 02:07:22.935
AND HERE WE'VE SEEN A DURING

02:07:23.002 --> 02:07:25.904
JULY LIKE FUN IN TWO THOUSAND

02:07:25.971 --> 02:07:26.472
SEVENTEEN EVERITT THE STF.

02:07:26.538 --> 02:07:27.573
THREE EMERGENCY COMMAND CENTER

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:30.843
AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING YOU

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:31.844
WERE GETTING THEIR PAYMENTS ARE

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:32.611
SENATE WAS BEING FED THE

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:35.581
CALLAWAY SCOTT SYSTEM THAT THE

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:40.452
DIRECTOR DO OUTREACH EMISSIONS.

02:07:40.519 --> 02:07:42.855
QUITE BRIEFLY.

02:07:42.921 --> 02:07:44.356
SO DURING THOMAS FIRE WHAT

02:07:44.423 --> 02:07:45.557
HAPPENED UNTIL NOW I SHOWED

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:46.425
INITIAL ATTACK SCENARIOS.

02:07:46.492 --> 02:07:48.093
DURING THE THOMAS FIRE WHAT

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:49.595
HAPPEN IS THERE WERE FOUR

02:07:49.661 --> 02:07:51.263
DIFFERENT BETTER EVENTS

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:53.065
SIGNIFICAN ROTARY VENTS THE FIRE

02:07:53.132 --> 02:07:54.600
STARTED IT'S MOVED IT'S MOVED

02:07:54.666 --> 02:07:55.801
AGAIN IT MOVED AGAIN SO

02:07:55.868 --> 02:07:57.469
MANAGEMENT OF THE FIRE AND

02:07:57.536 --> 02:07:58.971
HOLLYWOOD EVEN THOUGH BACK BURN

02:07:59.038 --> 02:07:59.638
TYPE OF SCENARIOS.

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.106
WHAT HAPPENS IF SOME AREA BURNS

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:02.141
FOR THE FIRE GO THROUGH THAT

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:03.609
AGAIN THIS TYPE OF SCENARIOS?

02:08:03.675 --> 02:08:04.777
OF WAS.

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:11.617
ANALYZED IN THE FIRE CAMP I'M

02:08:11.683 --> 02:08:13.252
GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH THOSE FOUR

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:15.087
BETTER EVENTS AND WHAT ELSE CAN

02:08:15.154 --> 02:08:16.188
BE DONE.

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:18.257
IF I MAY SAY ONE LAST THING

02:08:18.323 --> 02:08:19.525
THERE'S A HUGE UNFORTUNATELY

02:08:19.591 --> 02:08:20.559
BECAUSE SATELLITE DATA WAS

02:08:20.626 --> 02:08:22.227
DISCUSSED WE HAD SOME --

02:08:22.294 --> 02:08:23.195
COLLABORATIONS WITH HIGH

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.898
RESOLUTION SATELLITE COMPANIES --

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:27.699
INCLUDING PLANET VERY CAN GET

02:08:27.766 --> 02:08:29.735
DATA AT THIRTY CENTIMETERS TO

02:08:29.802 --> 02:08:32.137
FOOT FIFTY CENTIMETER RESOLUTION

02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:34.073
USING THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW WE

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:35.674
CAN USE THAT DATA YOU CAN

02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:37.810
UNDERSTAND LAND COVER AND OTHERS.

02:08:37.876 --> 02:08:39.912
CHANGES ON OVER TO LAND JUST

02:08:39.978 --> 02:08:41.447
LOOKING AT THESE PICTURES I

02:08:41.513 --> 02:08:42.848
RESOLUTION PICTURES.

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:45.484
SO THAT MEANS THE FUEL MODELS

02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:46.618
FOR INSTANCE WHAT BURNS DURING

02:08:46.685 --> 02:08:49.121
THE FIRE CAN BE UPDATED ON A

02:08:49.188 --> 02:08:50.489
REGULAR BASIS EVEN ON THE WEEKLY

02:08:50.556 --> 02:08:51.523
FASHION --

02:08:51.590 --> 02:08:53.192
USING EFFICIENT ARTIFICIAL

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:54.993
INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES AND WHAT

02:08:55.060 --> 02:08:56.628
WE GET FROM THEM LIKE VEGETATION

02:08:56.695 --> 02:08:58.897
CLASSIFICATION CAN BE MADE AS A

02:08:58.964 --> 02:09:00.299
PART OF THESE FIRE MODELS.

02:09:00.365 --> 02:09:01.834
AND CAN YOU SORT OF TO THE

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.235
MODELING COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

02:09:03.302 --> 02:09:05.604
THROUGH THIS NEUTRAL PLATFORM --

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:10.776
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WITH THE

02:09:10.843 --> 02:09:12.111
WIFI.

02:09:12.177 --> 02:09:12.978
ANOTHER THING HERE THAT YOU SEE

02:09:13.045 --> 02:09:14.213
IS HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:15.414
THE PREVENTION CAPABILITIES

02:09:15.481 --> 02:09:16.782
BECAUSE BY PUTTING ENOUGH A

02:09:16.849 --> 02:09:18.250
DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND HOMES

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:20.352
AND IDENTIFYING WHAT AREAS NEED

02:09:20.419 --> 02:09:22.154
FOR ORDER DEFENSIBLE SPACE FROM

02:09:22.221 --> 02:09:23.222
THIS IMAGERY.

02:09:23.288 --> 02:09:26.091
IT ACTUALLY CAN HELP WITH WHAT

02:09:26.158 --> 02:09:27.659
BURNS OR WHAT SHOULD AND BURNED

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:28.560
DURING THE FIRE SO WE CAN

02:09:28.627 --> 02:09:30.129
ACTUALLY REDUCE DAMAGE BY

02:09:30.195 --> 02:09:31.830
CAREFUL ANALYSIS USING THESE

02:09:31.897 --> 02:09:33.232
TECHNIQUES.

02:09:33.298 --> 02:09:35.033
SO AND THESE EMISSIONS FORTIES

02:09:35.100 --> 02:09:36.602
WILL BE IN THE COUPLE OF MILLION

02:09:36.668 --> 02:09:38.737
DOLLARS RANGE BUT IT CAN SAVE

02:09:38.804 --> 02:09:40.873
BILLIONS AT TIMES --

02:09:40.939 --> 02:09:44.643
AND LIVES OF COURSE WHICH ARE

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:46.712
PRICELESS THANK YOU.

02:09:46.778 --> 02:09:53.185
THEY FOR TESTIMONY.

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:55.020
SO MY NAME IS TAREQ SODIUM A

02:09:55.087 --> 02:09:55.554
PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL

02:09:55.621 --> 02:09:57.890
ENGINEERING AT UC BERKELEY AND

02:09:57.956 --> 02:09:59.658
I'M AHEAD OF THE FIRE RESEARCH

02:09:59.725 --> 02:10:00.959
GROUP --

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:02.494
THAT'S A COLLECTION OF PEOPLE --

02:10:02.561 --> 02:10:05.430
THAT ARE WORKING PRIMARILY AND

02:10:05.497 --> 02:10:09.334
ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY --

02:10:09.401 --> 02:10:10.669
CAUGHT FIRE.

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:11.303
WHICH SO.

02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:14.139
I'LL SIMPLY CLICK FORWARD --

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:15.908
IN THE EASY WAY TO PDF SO

02:10:15.974 --> 02:10:17.442
BASICALLY THE THE MAIN.

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:19.178
IMPETUS OF THIS WAS A COLLECTION

02:10:19.244 --> 02:10:21.213
OF SCIENTISTS FROM UC BERKELEY

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.848
LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABS

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:23.682
NASA.

02:10:23.749 --> 02:10:25.384
SPACE SCIENCES LABORATORIES AND

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:26.985
WITH FIRST RESPONDERS AND WE'RE

02:10:27.052 --> 02:10:28.854
ROUGHLY THIRTY PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:10:28.921 --> 02:10:30.155
DECIDED TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:31.223
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:32.658
EXIST RIGHT NOW IN THE FIRE

02:10:32.724 --> 02:10:33.559
SPACE.

02:10:33.625 --> 02:10:34.593
AND SEE WHETHER WE CAN REDUCE

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.428
THE COSTS AND MAKE THEM EASY TO

02:10:36.495 --> 02:10:37.396
PRODUCE.

02:10:37.462 --> 02:10:39.565
AND UBIQUITOUS SO THAT THEY'RE

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:40.299
BASICALLY --

02:10:40.365 --> 02:10:41.667
READILY AVAILABLE TO FIRST

02:10:41.733 --> 02:10:42.935
RESPONDERS SO WE'RE WORKING

02:10:43.001 --> 02:10:44.636
DIRECTLY WITH FIRST RESPONDERS

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:46.138
TO DEVELOP THE GADGETS AND TO

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:47.606
REDUCE THE PRICES ON THE COSTS

02:10:47.673 --> 02:10:49.308
USING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:50.142
TECHNIQUES.

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:51.343
I WON'T BORE YOU WITH ALL THE

02:10:51.410 --> 02:10:52.511
DETAILS AND FOR RUNNING VERY

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:55.280
SHORT ON TIME BASCALLY THE MAIN --

02:10:55.347 --> 02:10:56.682
FOR THRUSTS THAT WE HAVE ARE

02:10:56.748 --> 02:10:58.617
DEPLOYABLE SENSOR SYSTEMS IN

02:10:58.684 --> 02:11:02.588
REAL TIME MOBILE OF FIREFIGHTING.

02:11:02.654 --> 02:11:05.057
THAT MEANS ESSENTIALLY --

02:11:05.123 --> 02:11:06.458
WORKING CONSTANTLY ON U. A. V.

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:08.393
TECHNOLOGIES MAKING THEM CHEAP

02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.662
INEXPENSIVE AND ALSO ADAPTIVE.

02:11:10.729 --> 02:11:12.431
SO THE MAIN IDEA HERE IS TO

02:11:12.497 --> 02:11:13.732
AVOID --

02:11:13.799 --> 02:11:14.499
LARGE --

02:11:14.566 --> 02:11:16.902
UAVS THAT ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE TO

02:11:16.969 --> 02:11:18.770
REDUCE THE COSTS AND MAKE THEM

02:11:18.837 --> 02:11:20.572
EASILY DEPLOYABLE AND EASY TO

02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.874
LOSE AN EASY TO REPRODUCE SO THE

02:11:22.941 --> 02:11:24.876
MAIN IDEA HERE IS WE DON'T

02:11:24.943 --> 02:11:26.278
INVEST A LOT OF MONEY IN EACH

02:11:26.345 --> 02:11:27.546
INDIVIDUAL GADGET.

02:11:27.613 --> 02:11:28.847
WE'RE TRYING TO PRODUCE MASS

02:11:28.914 --> 02:11:30.449
PRODUCTIONS OF THESE GADGETS SO

02:11:30.515 --> 02:11:32.017
THAT PEOPLE CAN USE THEM AT AT

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:34.620
ANY GIVEN TIME SO THE IDEA IS IS

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:36.121
VERY MUCH LIKE A CELL PHONE.

02:11:36.188 --> 02:11:37.823
REDUCE THE COSTS MASS PRODUCTION

02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:38.991
USED THROUGH ADVANCED

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:40.626
MANUFACTURING SO THAT REALLY

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:42.594
LEVERAGES WHAT BERKELEY STRENGTH

02:11:42.661 --> 02:11:44.196
THIS AND ESSENTIALLY AND SILICON

02:11:44.263 --> 02:11:44.997
VALLEY.

02:11:45.063 --> 02:11:46.331
IT IS THE MASS PRODUCTION OF

02:11:46.398 --> 02:11:47.733
MANY GADGETS AND MAKING THEM

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:50.469
CHEAP TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST.

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:51.970
WE ARE NOT NECESSARILY FIRE

02:11:52.037 --> 02:11:53.372
PEOPLE I MEAN MANY OF US HAVE

02:11:53.438 --> 02:11:54.573
BEEN WORKING IN FIRE

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.474
TECHNOLOGIES FOR A NUMBER OF

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:57.009
YEARS WERE MAINLY PEOPLE THAT

02:11:57.075 --> 02:11:58.577
ARE WORKING IN THE MANUFACTURING

02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:00.178
ASPECTS REDUCE THE COSTS AND THE

02:12:00.245 --> 02:12:02.347
MAN IN THE GADGETS THEMSELVES.

02:12:02.414 --> 02:12:03.415
BECAUSE THEY SAID THE FOUR MAIN

02:12:03.482 --> 02:12:06.318
THRUST ARE YOU A VIS MOBILE REAL

02:12:06.385 --> 02:12:07.653
TIME COMPUTING.

02:12:07.719 --> 02:12:08.887
THAT MEANS SIMPLY PUTTING THE

02:12:08.954 --> 02:12:11.256
COMPUTERS ON THE UAV'S DIRECTLY.

02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:12.658
SO THE IDEA IS IS NO MORE SUPER

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:15.060
COMPUTERS EVERYTHING IS LOCAL

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:16.328
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE A SEAT

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:17.896
BASED ESSENTIALLY ON THE U. A.

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:19.298
V. DIRECTLY ITSELF.

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:20.399
AND IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP AND

02:12:20.465 --> 02:12:22.934
REPRODUCIBLE AND THAT TECHNOLOGY

02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:24.136
DOES EXIST NOW.

02:12:24.202 --> 02:12:28.206
HI WE'RE ALSO LOOKING GET A

02:12:28.273 --> 02:12:32.744
LARGE WE'RE TEN LEND MUCH OF OUR

02:12:32.811 --> 02:12:34.079
MOBILE COMPUTING --

02:12:34.146 --> 02:12:35.781
WITH THOSE KINDS OF SYSTEMS AND

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:37.482
THEN THEY KEEP STRENGTH AND I

02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:38.550
GUESS STRENGTH NUMBER FOUR IS

02:12:38.617 --> 02:12:39.451
REALLY WHERE --

02:12:39.518 --> 02:12:41.486
WE PUT A LOT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:12:41.553 --> 02:12:42.287
THREE D. PRINTING AND ADDITIVE

02:12:42.354 --> 02:12:44.056
MANUFACTURING SO THE MAIN IDEA

02:12:44.122 --> 02:12:45.791
THERE IS HOW TO PRODUCE THESE

02:12:45.857 --> 02:12:48.226
TYPES OF DEVICES INEXPENSIVELY.

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:50.862
AND IN THE LARGE SCALE SO --

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:52.831
THE TYPICAL APPROACH OF COURSE

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:54.499
IS TO TAKE A U. A. V. MOUNTED

02:12:54.566 --> 02:12:56.601
CAMERA ON IT AND SIMPLY PEOPLE

02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:57.569
DEPLOY IT.

02:12:57.636 --> 02:12:59.004
THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH MOST YOU A

02:12:59.071 --> 02:13:00.272
VISA IF YOU'VE EVER HAD ONE AND

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:01.940
I'VE HAD MANY OF THEM.

02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:03.075
IS ARE NOT SIMPLY.

02:13:03.141 --> 02:13:04.743
EASY TO CONTROL IN A TURBULENT

02:13:04.810 --> 02:13:05.944
ENVIRONMENT IN A FIRE LIKE

02:13:06.011 --> 02:13:07.746
ENVIRONMENT IS SEEN IN MANY OF

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:09.548
THE VIDEOS ALREADY BEFORE.

02:13:09.614 --> 02:13:10.916
A U. A. V. IS GOING TO FAIL I

02:13:10.982 --> 02:13:12.484
MEAN THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:13.852
BE PUT INTO SOME TYPE OF HIGH

02:13:13.919 --> 02:13:15.153
VORTEX --

02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.988
TYPE OF THE SYSTEM THE CAMERA

02:13:17.055 --> 02:13:18.490
SILLY RAYCROFT WHERE THE U. A.

02:13:18.557 --> 02:13:20.425
V. SO BASICALLY COLLAPSE SO WHAT

02:13:20.492 --> 02:13:21.460
WE'RE WORKING ON ADAPTIVE

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:25.364
CONTROL STRATEGIES. TO HAVE

02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.931
THESE THINGS ADAPT TO THEIR

02:13:25.997 --> 02:13:28.066
ENVIRONMENT --

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:30.335
IN EXISTING A TURBULENT SYSTEM

02:13:30.402 --> 02:13:31.436
THAT MIGHT BE IN A FIRE

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:34.172
SITUATION THE KEY HERE ALSO WITH

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:36.174
THESE ARE INEXPENSIVE IF WE LOSE

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:37.376
A HUNDRED OF THEM WHO CARES

02:13:37.442 --> 02:13:38.810
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HUNDRED

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:39.211
THOUSAND OF THEM.

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:40.712
SO IT'S EXACTLY LIKE WE HAD WITH

02:13:40.779 --> 02:13:42.547
CELL PHONES WE'RE NOT GOING TO

02:13:42.614 --> 02:13:44.015
PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS ON

02:13:44.082 --> 02:13:46.218
INDIVIDUAL GADGETS THAT COST A

02:13:46.284 --> 02:13:48.653
LOT WE WENT TO MASS PRODUCE THEM.

02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:50.188
WE WANT TO ALSO THEN LOOK AT THE

02:13:50.255 --> 02:13:51.990
ECONOMICS OF EXACTLY HOW YOU

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:53.024
MAKE THESE --

02:13:53.091 --> 02:13:53.859
YOU KNOW --

02:13:53.925 --> 02:13:56.294
AVAILABLE EASILY TO ROUTE FIRST

02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:58.096
RESPONDERS --

02:13:58.163 --> 02:13:59.431
SORT OF FOR THE WHERE DID ALL OF

02:13:59.498 --> 02:14:01.299
THIS STUFF COME FROM IT WAS A

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:02.734
LARGE SUPER COMPUTING CENTER

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:03.969
THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY THE US

02:14:04.035 --> 02:14:05.570
ARMY FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:06.605
TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:07.906
LAST TEN YEARS BETWEEN BERKELEY

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:09.074
AND STANFORD.

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:10.842
PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.644
EXPLOSION TECHNOLOGIES WHAT WE

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.979
WERE LOOKING AT WORK.

02:14:14.045 --> 02:14:15.614
GADGETS THE COULD PREDICT HOW

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.182
EXPLOSIONS OCCURRED --

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:18.650
THIS WAS PRIMARILY DONE ON THE

02:14:18.717 --> 02:14:19.785
EAST COAST WITH THE ABERDEEN

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:22.254
PROVING GROUNDS WHAT WE DID IS

02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:24.256
WE USED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FAST

02:14:24.322 --> 02:14:27.125
CALCULATIONS ON PREDICTING WHERE

02:14:27.192 --> 02:14:29.294
IEDS WOULD BASICALLY --

02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:32.397
EMITS AND PRODUCE HOT FRAGMENTS

02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:34.266
FROM THEIR WITHIN BRANCH ON TO

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:36.134
HOW WE DO THE COMPUTING LOCALLY

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:37.169
AND THEN HOW THE CAMERAS WOULD

02:14:37.235 --> 02:14:38.703
BE DEPLOYED SO THAT WE COULD

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:39.738
ESSENTIALLY.

02:14:39.805 --> 02:14:41.973
PROBE INTO EXTREMELY TURBULENT

02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.242
AND VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTS WITH

02:14:44.309 --> 02:14:46.077
RELATIVELY FAST AND EASY GADGETS

02:14:46.144 --> 02:14:48.146
AND TECHNOLOGY SO --

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:49.815
FOR THE SAKE OF TIME ASSEMBLY

02:14:49.881 --> 02:14:51.149
SAY THAT WHAT WERE --

02:14:51.216 --> 02:14:52.784
CURRENTLY WORKING ON A SWARM

02:14:52.851 --> 02:14:55.720
TYPE TO AS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:14:55.787 --> 02:14:58.290
DRONES RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVELY

02:14:58.356 --> 02:14:59.624
AND TRYING TO MIMIC THIS KIND OF

02:14:59.691 --> 02:15:01.827
BEHAVIOR USING ANIMAL --

02:15:01.893 --> 02:15:03.628
TYPE PSYCHOLOGIES IN USING THOSE

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.464
AS CONTROL ALGORITHMS FOR THE

02:15:05.530 --> 02:15:07.566
DRONES TO THE BASIC IDEA IS AS

02:15:07.632 --> 02:15:09.000
MUCH LIKE YOU HOW YOU SEE HOW

02:15:09.067 --> 02:15:10.435
STARLINGS BEHAVE.

02:15:10.502 --> 02:15:11.636
WERE EMBEDDING THOSE KINDS OF

02:15:11.703 --> 02:15:13.438
TECHNOLOGIES INTO THE DRONES

02:15:13.505 --> 02:15:15.140
THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN MOVE

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:16.374
ESSENTIALLY IN AN ECONOMIST

02:15:16.441 --> 02:15:17.275
FASHION.

02:15:17.342 --> 02:15:18.577
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A FIRST

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:20.979
RESPONDER ON HAND SO.

02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:23.348
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS IT'S

02:15:23.415 --> 02:15:25.183
ADVANCED MANUFACTURING --

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:27.786
IMP LEVERAGING ALL OF THE

02:15:27.853 --> 02:15:29.688
TECHNOLOGIES AND THREE D.

02:15:29.754 --> 02:15:30.222
PRINTING --

02:15:30.288 --> 02:15:32.023
THAT'S OF COURSE ESTIMATED TO BE

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:34.893
A ONE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMY --

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.795
BUSINESS OVER THE LAST HOUR THE

02:15:36.862 --> 02:15:38.196
NEXT FOUR YEARS I THAT'S

02:15:38.263 --> 02:15:39.731
PRIMARILY THROUGH DIGITIZED

02:15:39.798 --> 02:15:41.466
TECHNOLOGIES --

02:15:41.533 --> 02:15:42.634
THE BENEFIT OF COURSE THE

02:15:42.701 --> 02:15:44.302
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY IS RELATIVELY

02:15:44.369 --> 02:15:46.738
CLEAR SMALLER CARBON FOOTPRINT

02:15:46.805 --> 02:15:47.772
INCREASED DEMAND FOR NEW

02:15:47.839 --> 02:15:48.907
PRODUCTS --

02:15:48.974 --> 02:15:50.242
AND THEN OF COURSE IMPROVED

02:15:50.308 --> 02:15:52.244
PRODUCTIVITY PROFIT MARGINS AND

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:53.812
SO FORTH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

02:15:53.879 --> 02:15:55.614
TO SELL ADVANCED MANUFACTURING

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:56.615
IN THE STATE.

02:15:56.681 --> 02:15:57.282
SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE

02:15:57.349 --> 02:15:58.917
DOING REPLYING ADVANCED

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:01.686
TECHNOLOGIES TO THE FIRE --

02:16:01.753 --> 02:16:03.755
ECO SYSTEM SO I THINK IT ECHOES

02:16:03.822 --> 02:16:05.757
WHAT REPRESENTED DODD HAD

02:16:05.824 --> 02:16:07.526
INDICATED BUT CLEARING HOUSES.

02:16:07.592 --> 02:16:10.462
THE ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS

02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:13.365
THAT ARE INVOLVED I'VE WILL THAT

02:16:13.431 --> 02:16:15.734
WERE WERE RIGHT YOU DIFFERENT

02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:17.903
AND METHODS [inaudible]

02:16:17.969 --> 02:16:20.906
DIFFERENT FOR WE FELT THAT IT

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.340
WAS VERY IMPORTANT SINCE WE WERE

02:16:22.407 --> 02:16:24.142
ALL CHOKING BASICALLY LAST

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.277
NOVEMBER --

02:16:25.343 --> 02:16:26.578
ESSENTIALLY AS YOU CAN SEE THE

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:27.712
BAY AREA WAS BASICALLY

02:16:27.779 --> 02:16:29.548
SUFFOCATED AT THAT POINT WE

02:16:29.614 --> 02:16:31.216
COLLECTED EVERYONE TOGETHER AND

02:16:31.283 --> 02:16:32.183
WE DECIDED WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:34.419
EACH TECHNOLOGY SCRUTINIZE IT

02:16:34.486 --> 02:16:35.887
AND DETERMINE HOW WE CAN MAKE IT

02:16:35.954 --> 02:16:36.888
IN EXPENSIVE.

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:39.724
AND EASILY DEPLOYABLE SO THAT'S

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:43.428
BASICALLY OUR MISSION THANK YOU.

02:16:43.495 --> 02:16:46.464
IMPRESSIVE THANK YOU.

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:48.700
THIS TIME WILL WELCOME.

02:16:48.767 --> 02:16:49.901
CHIEF --

02:16:49.968 --> 02:16:53.972
FIRST EMERGED FIRE THREE UP

02:16:54.039 --> 02:16:54.272
[inaudible]

02:16:54.339 --> 02:17:04.883
TO ONE BUDGET TESTIMONY.

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:06.418
SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS SOME FOLKS

02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:07.953
MAY HAVE SOME TRAVEL PLANS IF

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.488
YOU HAVE.

US.

02:18:27.632 --> 02:18:29.467
IF THERE WAS EVER ANY QUESTION

02:18:29.534 --> 02:18:31.036
AS TO WHAT THE SINGLE HIGHEST

02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:32.070
THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS

02:18:32.137 --> 02:18:33.238
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:37.742
IT WAS ANSWERED IN TWO THOUSAND

02:18:37.809 --> 02:18:38.410
SEVENTEEN AND AGAIN IN.

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:38.910

NOT HAVE UNLIMITED BUDGETS

02:18:42.781 --> 02:18:44.082
HOWEVER.

02:18:44.149 --> 02:18:46.251
MORE MUST BE INVESTED IN TESTING

02:18:46.317 --> 02:18:48.687
NEW OR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY THAT

02:18:48.753 --> 02:18:49.254
WILL AID FIREFIGHTERS ON THE

DEFENSE CONTRACTOR GENERAL

02:19:11.176 --> 02:19:12.143
ATOMICS.

02:19:12.210 --> 02:19:14.946
THEY BUILD AND FLY A VARIETY OF

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:16.781
PREDATORS IN IN WAR THEATER --

02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:18.550
THEY APPROACHED US AND WE'RE

02:19:18.616 --> 02:19:20.985
WILLING TO PROVIDE MANNED

02:19:21.052 --> 02:19:23.722
AIRCRAFT THAT COULD BE USED

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:25.690
DURING A WILDLAND FIRE.

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:27.625
WE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE SAME

IS ALSO USING --

02:22:08.152 --> 02:22:09.554
WHAT WE HEARD HERE TODAY THE

02:22:09.621 --> 02:22:11.289
UNIVERSITY SAN DIEGO'S WHY FIRE

02:22:11.356 --> 02:22:12.257
PROGRESSION MOLLY YOU SAW A

02:22:12.323 --> 02:22:14.926
GREAT MAP FROM THE LILAC FIRE UP

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:16.694
THE DOCTOR OTAGES FLASHED UP?

02:22:16.761 --> 02:22:18.663
THAT REALLY KIND OF YOU KNOW PUT

02:22:18.730 --> 02:22:20.899
WE'LL VALIDATED THE THE ACCURACY

02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:23.134
OF THE TOOL --

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.569
THE TECHNOLOGY ISSUE DISCUSSES

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.104
BEEN USED BY LA FIRE THE BIG

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:27.672
DIFFERENCE IS LA FIRE GETS A

02:22:27.739 --> 02:22:28.740
RESPONSE.

02:22:28.806 --> 02:22:30.074
THEY GET A LOCATION ON THE MAP

02:22:30.141 --> 02:22:31.476
THE PAIN GETS DROPPED IT GIVES

02:22:31.542 --> 02:22:32.710
US COMMANDERS.

02:22:32.777 --> 02:22:34.045
WHERE THAT FAR PROGRESSION

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:35.613
MODELING IS THE DIFFERENCE IS

02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:37.649
THE AIRBORNE PLATFORM OVER THE

02:22:37.715 --> 02:22:39.217
TOP THAT FAR PROVIDING

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:40.752
CONTINUOUS AS LONG AS THAT

02:22:40.818 --> 02:22:41.519
CAMERAS ON IT?

02:22:41.586 --> 02:22:43.121
IT'S CONTINUOUSLY CHANGING THE

02:22:43.187 --> 02:22:46.557
MODEL AND SO EITHER NOT ASKING

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:47.659
FOR CALLING BACK AS IN DROP A

02:22:47.725 --> 02:22:52.163
PIN DROP ANOTHER PIN DROP.

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:53.131
IT IS CONTINUOUSLY MODELING.

02:22:53.197 --> 02:22:54.365
ANOTHER VALUE ADD IN THIS IS ONE

02:22:54.432 --> 02:22:56.067
THAT I THINK YOU'LL APPRECIATE

02:22:56.134 --> 02:22:57.902
ONE WE GET ALL THE TIME AS FAR

02:22:57.969 --> 02:22:58.970
APART AS IS YOU KNOW.

02:22:59.037 --> 02:23:00.305
WHAT WAS YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE

02:23:00.371 --> 02:23:01.739
THE THE END RESULT THAT FAR WILL

02:23:01.806 --> 02:23:02.173
TELL YOU --

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:04.175
WE LOST THREE HUNDRED STRUCTURES

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.910
YOU KNOW HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

02:23:05.977 --> 02:23:06.778
WORTH OF DAMAGE.

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:09.047
IMAGINE YOU'RE HAVING THAT FIRE

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:10.315
MODEL MAP.

02:23:10.381 --> 02:23:11.816
COMPARING IT AGAINST THE ACTUAL

02:23:11.883 --> 02:23:13.251
SUPPRESSION MAP IN BEING ABLE TO

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:15.253
GO BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW HAD WE

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:16.721
NOT STOPPED HERE ON THIS REGION

02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:18.756
THIS ROAD WE HAVE LOST TWO

02:23:18.823 --> 02:23:20.091
HUNDRED HOMES POTENTIALLY

02:23:20.158 --> 02:23:22.060
ANOTHER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

02:23:22.126 --> 02:23:23.728
WE HAVEN'T HAD A TOOL LIKE THAT

02:23:23.795 --> 02:23:25.063
THAT THAT ALLOWED US TO QUALIFY

02:23:25.129 --> 02:23:26.464
THAT IS IN THE OTHER.

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:31.302
VALUE AT NOT TO MENTION DIRECTOR

02:23:31.369 --> 02:23:33.137
GIL ARE DUE TO TALK ABOUT.

02:23:33.204 --> 02:23:34.772
THIS FEEDS DIRECTLY INTO IT SO

02:23:34.839 --> 02:23:35.740
YOU'RE GETTING ALL OF THIS

02:23:35.807 --> 02:23:38.910
INFORMATION ALL THE STATE EOC IS

02:23:38.977 --> 02:23:41.946
OF A LOCAL UC'S THIS IS

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:42.213
AVAILABLE.

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.248
NOW -- ONE

02:23:44.315 --> 02:23:47.118
OTHER PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WORKING --

02:23:47.185 --> 02:23:49.454
CLOSELY WITH IS --

02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:53.024
CALLED THE IT'S A IS A NIGHT

02:23:53.091 --> 02:23:54.525
TIME TYPE ONE HELLO TACK OR

02:23:54.592 --> 02:23:55.660
HELLO TANKER HUBBLE FREEL

02:23:55.727 --> 02:23:56.527
PROGRAM THERE SOME GREAT

02:23:56.594 --> 02:23:58.763
QUESTIONS EARLIER BY SOME OF THE

02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:00.264
COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT NIGHT

02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:01.466
TIME FIRE FIGHTING.

02:24:01.532 --> 02:24:02.634
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN AYE TIME

02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:04.635
FIRE FIGHTING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:05.970
DEVELOPED A PROGRAM AND HAVE

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:07.505
INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT

02:24:07.572 --> 02:24:09.741
WHAT IS VERY DIFFERENT ABOUT THE

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:10.375
PROGRAM THAT WE'RE WE'RE GONNA

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:11.943
SHOW UP.

02:24:12.010 --> 02:24:12.510
PROBABLY LESS THAN A MINUTE

02:24:12.577 --> 02:24:13.344
VIDEO ON IT.

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:14.379
IS THIS IS WITH WHAT WE CALL A

02:24:14.445 --> 02:24:16.180
TYPE ONE HELL ATTACKER OF VERY

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:18.549
LARGE HELICOPTER DRINKING.

02:24:18.616 --> 02:24:21.152
DROPPING LARGE VOLUMES OF WATER.

02:24:21.219 --> 02:24:22.320
AT NIGHT.

02:24:22.387 --> 02:24:24.389
BIG DIFFERENCE IS THEIR HOVER

02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:26.190
FILLING FROM NATURAL WATER SIZE

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.658
SOURCES WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME

02:24:27.725 --> 02:24:28.860
FOR THE DATE TIME THE GOING TO

02:24:28.926 --> 02:24:32.163
THE LAKE AND THEY COME OUT WE

02:24:32.230 --> 02:24:33.131
DON'T DO THAT.

02:24:33.197 --> 02:24:34.198
NO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

02:24:34.265 --> 02:24:36.334
AGAIN I'VE I'VE OPERATE NIGHT

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:37.268
AND HELICOPTERS WE HAVE TO LAND.

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.170
HOSE COMES OUT WE PLUG IN WE

02:24:39.237 --> 02:24:40.938
FILL TAKE SOME TIME.

02:24:41.005 --> 02:24:42.840
SOON AS IT'S DONE WERE OFF THE

02:24:42.907 --> 02:24:46.811
RECORD MANY FIRE. TO BE ABLE TO

02:24:46.878 --> 02:24:48.546
HOVER FILL IN A SOURCE NEXT THE

02:24:48.613 --> 02:24:50.214
FIRE OR IN A TANK.

02:24:50.281 --> 02:24:52.050
MEANS WAR WATER MORE PRODUCT IS

02:24:52.116 --> 02:24:53.351
GOING ON THAT FAR THAT IS

02:24:53.418 --> 02:24:55.953
AVAILABLE NOW --

02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.388
IT IS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED

02:24:57.455 --> 02:24:58.956
THIS MODEL IN AUSTRALIA QUITE

02:24:59.023 --> 02:25:00.591
FRANKLY AUSTRALIA'S DOING SOME

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:02.160
THINGS ARE RIGHT NOW AT NIGHT

02:25:02.226 --> 02:25:03.761
WITH AVIATION RESOURCES THAT

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:05.229
WE'RE NOT --

02:25:05.296 --> 02:25:06.931
DIRECTOR PORTER --

02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:08.933
TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE NIGHT OF

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.102
FIXED WING AIR TANKER PROGRAMS

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:12.770
THAT WERE NOT DROPPING AND I

02:25:12.837 --> 02:25:14.005
HE'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.540
YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON A

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:16.974
PROGRAM IN AUSTRALIA WHERE

02:25:17.041 --> 02:25:17.775
THEY'RE GOING TO BE DROPPING

02:25:17.842 --> 02:25:19.811
**** OUT OF FIXED WING AIRCRAFT

02:25:19.877 --> 02:25:20.678
AT NIGHT.

02:25:20.745 --> 02:25:23.281
EACH YEAR THE TECHNOLOGY IS ON

02:25:23.347 --> 02:25:24.882
THE DOORSTEP --

02:25:24.949 --> 02:25:26.384
WE'RE JUST NOT QUITE THERE YET

02:25:26.451 --> 02:25:27.919
HERE LOCALLY --

02:25:27.985 --> 02:25:28.920
WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS

02:25:28.986 --> 02:25:30.788
PROGRAM AGAIN AND IN SOUTHERN

02:25:30.855 --> 02:25:32.890
CALIFORNIA MOST COUNTIES OURS

02:25:32.957 --> 02:25:34.792
INCLUDED OPERATE NIGHT TIME

02:25:34.859 --> 02:25:36.294
FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT?

02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:37.261
BUT IF YOU LIVE IN NORTHERN

02:25:37.328 --> 02:25:38.596
CALIFORNIA NAME ANY OTHER

02:25:38.663 --> 02:25:40.264
LOCATION A STATE YOU HAVE A FIRE

02:25:40.331 --> 02:25:41.866
AT NIGHT.

02:25:41.933 --> 02:25:42.733
YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GETTING

02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:43.835
ORANGE COUNTY OR LA COUNTY

02:25:43.901 --> 02:25:45.670
VENTURA COUNTY THEY'RE NOT

COMING UP YOUR FIRE.

02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:48.806
THE FOREST SERVICE DOES OPERATE

02:25:48.873 --> 02:25:50.575
ONE HELICOPTER AT NIGHT IT'S OUT

02:25:50.641 --> 02:25:52.877
OF FOXFIELD LANCASTER.

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:54.545
IT MAY COME UP TO YOUR FIRE TAKE

02:25:54.612 --> 02:25:57.148
SOME TIME THIS PROGRAM IS FUNDED

02:25:57.215 --> 02:25:59.484
THIS PILOT PROGRAM.

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:00.318
PUTS A NIGHT TIME.

02:26:00.384 --> 02:26:02.019
HEAVY HELICOPTER TYPE ONE HELL

02:26:02.086 --> 02:26:04.755
ATTACKER AVAILABLE TO ANY.

02:26:04.822 --> 02:26:06.023
ANY FIRE DEPARTMENT ANY

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:11.028
ANYWHERE THE STATE.

02:26:11.095 --> 02:26:13.131
THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE NOW --

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:14.665
ALL PLAY A QUICK VIDEO IN THE

02:26:14.732 --> 02:26:16.501
ESSENCE OF TIME AND THEN WE'LL

02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:18.870
WRAP THIS UP.

02:26:18.936 --> 02:26:20.638
WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LAST TEN

02:26:20.705 --> 02:26:22.373
YEARS -- IN

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:23.908
NORTH AMERICA ON A LIFELINE

02:26:23.975 --> 02:26:25.276
PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES THIS

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:26.477
AIRCRAFT WHICH IS THIS COURSE

02:26:26.544 --> 02:26:27.445
GUESS.

02:26:27.512 --> 02:26:27.979
SEVENTY SIX HAS A THERMAL

02:26:28.045 --> 02:26:30.748
IMAGING CAMERA ON THE NOSE OF IT.

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:34.285
AND WORKING ON WITH A

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:34.919
FIREBOMBING HELICOPTER WHICH IS

02:26:34.986 --> 02:26:38.322
THE S. SIX IT LIES ABOUT TWO

02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:40.291
THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE GROUND.

02:26:40.358 --> 02:26:42.326
AND IT'S USED TO PROTECT THE

02:26:42.393 --> 02:26:44.328
FIREBOMBING HELICOPTERS SO WE

02:26:44.395 --> 02:26:47.165
REALLY TAKE THE RISK OUT OF THE

02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.767
FIRE BOMBING OPERATIONS.

02:26:49.834 --> 02:26:51.602
SO THE AIR TAC OFFICER WHO'S UP

02:26:51.669 --> 02:26:52.770
IN THE FRONT --

02:26:52.837 --> 02:26:53.004
WILL --

02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:56.240
SELECTED TARGETS AND THEN I WILL

02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:57.808
MOVE THE CAMERA ON TO THAT

02:26:57.875 --> 02:27:00.077
DESIGNATED TARGET --

02:27:00.144 --> 02:27:02.079
TURN ON THE LASER --

02:27:02.146 --> 02:27:04.148
WHICH STAND ELIMINATES THAT AND

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:06.284
THE SIXTY ONE JUST FOLLOWS THE

02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:11.189
BEAM DOWN TO THE LASER ON THE

02:27:11.255 --> 02:27:14.625
GROUND AND DROPS THE WATER.

02:27:14.692 --> 02:27:16.227
IT'S AN OPERATION WE'RE NOT

02:27:16.294 --> 02:27:17.328
WE'RE NOT OPERATING LIKE THIS

02:27:17.395 --> 02:27:18.829
THE UNITED STATES AND I AND I

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:21.599
CAN SAY THIS AGAIN HAVING --

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:23.100
VAN A NIGHT TIME WATER DROP

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:25.369
OPERATIONS IS.

02:27:25.436 --> 02:27:26.037
TWO THOUSAND FOUR YOU KNOW THERE

02:27:26.103 --> 02:27:27.271
WAS A QUESTION EARLIER BY ONE OF

02:27:27.338 --> 02:27:28.573
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ASKED

02:27:28.639 --> 02:27:30.107
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:27:30.174 --> 02:27:31.809
DROPPING WATER DURING THE DAY

02:27:31.876 --> 02:27:33.911
AND AND AT NIGHT TIME --

02:27:33.978 --> 02:27:35.680
THE TYPICALLY IN THE WINDS ARE

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:37.315
BLOWING IS IS STRONGLY AT NIGHT

02:27:37.381 --> 02:27:38.849
TO WE'RE NOT TALKING TO SANTA

02:27:38.916 --> 02:27:40.017
ANA WIND DRIVEN FIRE.

02:27:40.084 --> 02:27:41.652
TYPICALLY THE RELATIVE HUMIDITY

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:42.520
IS ARE UP.

02:27:42.587 --> 02:27:45.423
ARE DROPS ARE ACTUALLY MORE

02:27:45.489 --> 02:27:48.526
EFFECTIVE ALL THE AIRCRAFT

02:27:48.593 --> 02:27:50.228
BECAUSE IT'S JUST A FEW FLYING

02:27:50.294 --> 02:27:51.362
WHICH READS COMMUNICATIONS

02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:52.830
BETWEEN THE GROUND OF THE AIR

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:54.298
MUCH MORE CLEAR --

02:27:54.365 --> 02:27:56.234
IT'S A GAME CHANGER. ONE OF THE

02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:57.935
THINGS THAT THIS PROGRAM DOES

02:27:58.002 --> 02:27:59.470
THAT OUR CURRENT PROGRAMS ARE

02:27:59.537 --> 02:28:00.938
NOT IS IT MEASURE SUCCESS.

02:28:01.005 --> 02:28:02.707
WITH THE THE LASER BEAM THAT CAN

02:28:02.773 --> 02:28:03.641
ONLY BE SEEN THROUGH THE NIGHT

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:04.709
VISION GOGGLES THEY'RE

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:06.844
IDENTIFYING ANY HAZARDS IN THE

02:28:06.911 --> 02:28:08.179
AREA THAT THAT HELICOPTER THIS

02:28:08.246 --> 02:28:09.413
GOING BACK AND FORTH THE FIRE

02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:10.982
MAY RUN YOU KNOW THAT THEY COULD

02:28:11.048 --> 02:28:12.250
CAUSE A HAZARD.

02:28:12.316 --> 02:28:13.851
IN IDENTIFIES WHERE EXACTLY IS

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:16.254
TO DROP WHERE THE DROP INS.

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:17.822

THIS IS WHAT WE DID THIS OF WHAT

02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:23.327
LOOKED LIKE.

02:28:23.394 --> 02:28:25.263
AN FOR NOT BEING SUCCESSFUL WE

02:28:25.329 --> 02:28:27.231
REDUCE THE RISK WE SHUT DOWN IF

02:28:27.298 --> 02:28:28.466
WE'RE NOTBEING SUCCESSFUL WE

02:28:28.532 --> 02:28:29.934
SHOULDN'T BE FLYING IN PUTTING

RESEARCHERS THERE IN THE FRONT

02:33:04.441 --> 02:33:14.051
ROW.

02:33:14.118 --> 02:33:15.886
CAN REPEAT THAT AGAIN.

02:33:15.953 --> 02:33:18.122
I I'M INTERESTED IN IN THE IN

02:33:18.188 --> 02:33:19.490
THE LEVEL OF COOPERATION WITH

02:33:19.557 --> 02:33:20.324
CAL -- YES

02:33:20.391 --> 02:33:22.593
CAL FIRE --

WILL IN IN IN IN TRYING TO

02:33:31.902 --> 02:33:32.670
WORKED.

02:33:32.736 --> 02:33:35.973
YOU KNOW TOWARDS A NUMBER --

02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:38.609
ONE I PREVENTION OF FIRES INTO

02:33:38.676 --> 02:33:41.745
SUPPRESSION OF FIRES.

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:43.180
FIRST AS A STATE ONE THING IS WE

02:33:43.247 --> 02:33:44.715
ARE INTEGRATED WITH A LOT OF THE

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:45.883
FIRE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS

02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:48.786
WE GET REQUESTED TO THE FIRES.

02:33:48.852 --> 02:33:50.487
TO PROVIDE THE ATMOSPHERIC

02:33:50.554 --> 02:33:52.423
MEASUREMENTS AND SO THOSE DATA

02:33:52.489 --> 02:33:54.992
ACTUALLY ARE PROVIDED TO THE

02:33:55.059 --> 02:33:56.460
INCIDENT METEOROLOGISTS.

02:33:56.527 --> 02:33:58.362
DATE WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED ON

02:33:58.429 --> 02:34:01.231
THE DETWILER FIRE WHERE THEY

02:34:01.298 --> 02:34:02.499
CLEARED AIRSPACE SO WE CAN A

02:34:02.566 --> 02:34:03.634
WEATHER BALLOON UP BECAUSE

02:34:03.701 --> 02:34:04.969
AIRCRAFT SUPPRESSION --

02:34:05.035 --> 02:34:06.837
WAS REDUCED BECAUSE THE SMOKE A

02:34:06.904 --> 02:34:08.839
LOT OF TIMES SMOKE HINDERS THE

02:34:08.906 --> 02:34:10.941
SUPPRESSION EFFORTS SO GETTING A

02:34:11.008 --> 02:34:12.209
THESE TYPES OF SOUNDINGS ARE

02:34:12.276 --> 02:34:13.177
REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:34:13.243 --> 02:34:14.612
IT'S NOT EASY TO DO BECAUSE OF

02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:15.412
ALL ACTIVE --

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:16.513
AIRCRAFT --

02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:18.248
OPERATION SO WE INTERACT A LOT

02:34:18.315 --> 02:34:20.250
OUR DATA GOES OUT AND WE MAKE IT

02:34:20.317 --> 02:34:22.252
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS WELL AS

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.154
SAME WITH THE SENATE THE STATE --

02:34:24.221 --> 02:34:25.823
WEATHER FORECASTING MODEL IT'S

02:34:25.889 --> 02:34:29.693
UP ONLINE ONE KILOMETER OVER THE

02:34:29.760 --> 02:34:33.464
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO YEAH.

02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:34.632
SAME THING WITH UC BERKELEY WERE

02:34:34.698 --> 02:34:35.833
LOOK WE'RE WORKING WITH A

02:34:35.899 --> 02:34:37.635
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES --

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.236
PHILANTHROPISTS AS WELL AND

02:34:39.303 --> 02:34:40.971
SILICON VALLEY OBVIOUS IS A LOT

02:34:41.038 --> 02:34:42.373
OF WEALTHY PEOPLE THAT CARE

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:44.241
ABOUT THEIR AIR QUALITY --

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:46.744
AT LOT OF INTERACTION ALSO FOR

02:34:46.810 --> 02:34:48.245
EXAMPLE WITH THE SOUTH COAST AIR

02:34:48.312 --> 02:34:49.847
QUALITY BOARD --

02:34:49.913 --> 02:34:51.515
TO MONITOR CONTROLLED BURNS AND

02:34:51.582 --> 02:34:53.017
TO TRY TO USE TECHNOLOGY TO

02:34:53.083 --> 02:34:54.518
SHARPEN THE PERMITTING PROCESS

02:34:54.585 --> 02:34:55.452
SEES.

02:34:55.519 --> 02:34:56.353
OF WHEN YOU DO --

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:57.721
CONTROLLED BURNS JUST TO GIVE

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:58.822
YOU AN EXAMPLE --

02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:00.224
WHEN A FIRE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO

02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:01.392
DO A CONTROLLED BURN THEY HAVE

02:35:01.458 --> 02:35:03.494
TO GIVE A TWO WEEK NOTICE THEY

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.395
GIVE A TWO WEEK NOTICE THE FOR

02:35:04.461 --> 02:35:06.096
AIR QUALITY BOARD DETERMINES?

02:35:06.163 --> 02:35:07.598
YES YOU CAN DO A A CONTROLLED

02:35:07.665 --> 02:35:09.900
BURN BUT THEY CAN YANK THAT

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.368
PERMIT UP UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE.

02:35:11.435 --> 02:35:13.270
AND IT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE THE

02:35:13.337 --> 02:35:14.738
TYPE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE

02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:16.573
USED TO BASICALLY PREDICT THESE

02:35:16.640 --> 02:35:17.941
KINDS OF THINGS ARE SOMEWHAT

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:18.942
COURSE.

02:35:19.009 --> 02:35:19.910
SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH

02:35:19.977 --> 02:35:21.545
THIS STATE AGENCIES TO BRING THE

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:23.647
TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR THAT SHARPENS

02:35:23.714 --> 02:35:25.249
THESE KINDS OF ESTIMATES THAT

02:35:25.315 --> 02:35:27.051
PEOPLE CAN MAKE. TO THEY REDUCE

02:35:27.117 --> 02:35:28.819
THE COSTS OF THE FIRE THE FIRST

02:35:28.886 --> 02:35:30.454
RESPONDERS THEMSELVES SO FOR

02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:31.689
EXAMPLE A FIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN

02:35:31.755 --> 02:35:34.525
THEY'RE PERMIT GET YANKED A DAY

02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:38.095
BEFORE COSTS ALL THE PEOPLE THAT

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:39.163
GOT DEPLOYED.

02:35:39.229 --> 02:35:40.764
AND THEY BASICALLY YOU KNOW --

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:42.966
LOSE A QUITE A BIT OF MONEY SO

02:35:43.033 --> 02:35:44.268
IS THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT

02:35:44.334 --> 02:35:45.803
WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS IN

02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:48.072
ON WHICH IS COST REDUCTIONS I

02:35:48.138 --> 02:35:50.074
THINK THAT'S AGAIN OUR THEME.

02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:50.874
THERE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:35:50.941 --> 02:35:53.010
EXPERTS IN FIRE TECHNOLOGIES

02:35:53.077 --> 02:35:54.411
RINSES IN THE LARGE SCALE

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:56.113
MANUFACTURING MAKING THINGS

02:35:56.180 --> 02:35:57.481
CHEAP AND WORKING WITH ANY

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:59.983
AGENCY THAT WANTS TO REDUCE

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:02.319
COSTS --

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:03.187
ALSO.

02:36:03.253 --> 02:36:04.421
GOING GREEN ON THE DATA

02:36:04.488 --> 02:36:05.589
TECHNOLOGY PART THE BEEN

02:36:05.656 --> 02:36:07.324
COOPERATING CLOSELY --

02:36:07.391 --> 02:36:08.192
IN RESEARCH MODE --

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:09.293
WITH THE NUMBER OF FIRE

02:36:09.359 --> 02:36:11.662
DEPARTMENTS CAL FIRE AND HELLO

02:36:11.729 --> 02:36:13.230
YES AND SEE IF YOU.

02:36:13.297 --> 02:36:15.432
ANA'S VIEW GOING FROM THAT MOTOR

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:16.934
HOW CAN MAY ACTUALLY BE THE

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:18.936
NEUTRAL PLATFORM THAT CAN INGEST

02:36:19.002 --> 02:36:20.304
DATA FROM STATES NETWORK SOME

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.406
SORT OF DONE TO MODELING

02:36:22.473 --> 02:36:23.440
COMMUNITY AND OTHERS.

02:36:23.507 --> 02:36:26.710
OF INTERFACES TO THE STATE ALL.

02:36:26.777 --> 02:36:28.278
I THINK IT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:36:28.345 --> 02:36:29.313
THERE IS RIGHT NOW WE ARE BEING

02:36:29.379 --> 02:36:30.714
SUPPORTED BY INDIVIDUAL FIRE

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:32.950
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE

02:36:33.016 --> 02:36:34.618
TO SUSTAIN THESE TOOLS.

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:36.220
I THINK A PROFESSIONAL FUNDING

02:36:36.286 --> 02:36:37.521
AT THE STATE LEVEL WOULD HELP

02:36:37.588 --> 02:36:38.722
THESE INDIVIDUAL FIRE

02:36:38.789 --> 02:36:39.857
DEPARTMENTS AND THE OVERALL

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:43.127
COMMUNITY AND THIS IS COMPLETELY

02:36:43.193 --> 02:36:45.062
AN OPEN PUBLIC PLATFORM.

02:36:45.129 --> 02:36:47.264
SO IN A SENSE BY FIRES HAVING

02:36:47.331 --> 02:36:48.398
NOT GROWTH CHALLENGE OF YOU KNOW

02:36:48.465 --> 02:36:49.366
THERE'S A USEFUL RESOURCE

02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:51.435
PRODUCT THAT IS BEING

02:36:51.502 --> 02:36:53.570
OPERATIONALIZE AND HOW CAN ME.

02:36:53.637 --> 02:37:02.179
OF MADE OF RACIALIZED AT SCALE

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:03.180
YOU -- CAL

02:37:03.247 --> 02:37:05.916
FIRE DISPATCH --

02:37:05.983 --> 02:37:07.718
SENT ELENA ALSO MONTAVISTA SO

02:37:07.785 --> 02:37:08.919
WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM

02:37:08.986 --> 02:37:10.854
SO THEY HAVE LIVE CONTROL OF THE

02:37:10.921 --> 02:37:11.455
CAMERAS.

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:14.124
GAS AND CONFIRM NINE ONE ONE

02:37:14.191 --> 02:37:15.325
WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH CALLOW

02:37:15.392 --> 02:37:16.627
YES -- TO

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:17.761
LOCATE --

02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:19.797
STRONG MOTION SENSORS ON SOME OF

02:37:19.863 --> 02:37:21.632
OUR TOWERS SO THAT THEY BECOME

02:37:21.698 --> 02:37:23.734
MULTI HASN WE'RE ALSO WORKING

02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:25.068
WITH CINEMA WATER.

02:37:25.135 --> 02:37:26.570
DISEASE FIRES A REAL PROBLEM FOR

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:28.839
WATER QUALITY AND SO WE HAVE

02:37:28.906 --> 02:37:30.607
MOISTURE SENSORS AN ATMOSPHERIC

02:37:30.674 --> 02:37:32.709
RIVER SO WE CAN DETECT --

02:37:32.776 --> 02:37:33.911
AND TRY TO BETTER PREDICT AND

02:37:33.977 --> 02:37:35.579
UNDERSTAND HOW THESE ATMOSPHERIC

02:37:35.646 --> 02:37:38.115
RIVER SET UP AND WHAT KIND OF

02:37:38.182 --> 02:37:39.149
FLOODING AND RESULTS GONNA

02:37:39.216 --> 02:37:40.818
HAPPEN SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK

02:37:40.884 --> 02:37:42.519
ACROSS THE BOARD WITH ALL THESE

02:37:42.586 --> 02:37:44.454
AGENCIES BUT WE ALSO.

02:37:44.521 --> 02:37:44.688
HAVE --

02:37:44.755 --> 02:37:46.957
PUBLIC WEBSITE THE PEOPLE CAN

02:37:47.024 --> 02:37:49.293
GET ON AND AND CHECK THEIR OWN

02:37:49.359 --> 02:37:52.729
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND THANKS

02:37:52.796 --> 02:37:55.332
AGAIN FOR TODAY.

02:37:55.399 --> 02:37:55.966
SO I THINK THE GENERAL TAKE AWAY

02:37:56.033 --> 02:37:56.567
THERE'S THAT YES THERE'S A LOT

02:37:56.633 --> 02:37:57.501
OF COLLABORATION GOING ON BUT WE

02:37:57.568 --> 02:38:01.471
COULD DO BETTER.

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:02.906
DOCTORS GIVE YOU COULD --

02:38:02.973 --> 02:38:04.341
THE BEER TEN THE QUESTION I

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.109
ASKED I THINK TO PREVIOUS PANEL.

02:38:06.176 --> 02:38:07.578
WE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT

02:38:07.644 --> 02:38:09.379
CAMERAS THE DEPLOYMENT AND SOLD

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:10.614
CURRENTLY GOT EIGHTY FIVE

02:38:10.681 --> 02:38:12.549
CAMERAS I THINK IT WAS DEPLOYED

02:38:12.616 --> 02:38:15.886
MOSTLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA --

02:38:15.953 --> 02:38:18.622
AND THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS TO DO

02:38:18.689 --> 02:38:20.224
NOT TO TO ADD ADDITIONAL ONE

02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:21.558
HUNDRED CAMERAS.

02:38:21.625 --> 02:38:22.826
I ASSUME MOST WAS CAMPUS WILL BE

02:38:22.893 --> 02:38:24.328
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA --

02:38:24.394 --> 02:38:25.696
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE EIGHTY FIVE

02:38:25.762 --> 02:38:26.563
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURSE

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:28.131
MAYBE IT WORKS LIKE THE

02:38:28.198 --> 02:38:31.535
LEGISLATURE DOES IN MOST THE

02:38:31.602 --> 02:38:35.138
RESOURCES GO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:38:35.205 --> 02:38:36.940
BUT SO GEN.

02:38:37.007 --> 02:38:38.909
EDUCATE ME ON THE SUBJECT SO SO

02:38:38.976 --> 02:38:39.910
HERE HOME.

02:38:39.977 --> 02:38:40.577
I DO HAVE A SLIDE THAT SHOWS WE

02:38:40.644 --> 02:38:41.545
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:46.149
CAMERAS IN CALIFORNIA NOW --

02:38:46.216 --> 02:38:46.683
EIGHTY FIVE WHEN IN SINCE

02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:47.150
DECEMBER.

02:38:47.217 --> 02:38:48.919
AND WE'RE POPULATING WE'RE

02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:50.754
WORKING WITH THE THREE UTILITIES

02:38:50.821 --> 02:38:51.755
P. JEANNIE --

02:38:51.822 --> 02:38:53.657
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON AND

02:38:53.724 --> 02:38:55.759
ES DE JEANNIE. TWO YEARS AGO WE

02:38:55.826 --> 02:38:57.828
INSTALLED CAMERAS FOR SDG AND IT

02:38:57.895 --> 02:38:59.329
WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS

02:38:59.396 --> 02:39:01.131
STILL IS AND THEIR COMMAND

02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:02.432
CENTER --

02:39:02.499 --> 02:39:03.734
WITH MOVED UP AND WORKING WITH

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:05.302
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON

02:39:05.369 --> 02:39:06.904
AND PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC SO

02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:08.705
YES WERE POPULATING THE NORTHERN

02:39:08.772 --> 02:39:10.240
PART WE HAVE CAMERAS IN ORTH

02:39:10.307 --> 02:39:12.109
BAY -- WHERE

02:39:12.175 --> 02:39:15.612
THE TUBS FIRE NUNS FIRE WERE AND --

02:39:15.679 --> 02:39:17.648
THE CAMERAS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED

02:39:17.714 --> 02:39:18.949
BY THIS --

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:20.751
ASK WOULD BE CAMERAS THAT ARE

02:39:20.817 --> 02:39:23.420
OUTSIDE OF THE THREE MAJOR

02:39:23.487 --> 02:39:24.688
UTILITIES.

02:39:24.755 --> 02:39:29.259
SO THAT WE COULD POPULATE THIS

02:39:29.326 --> 02:39:30.727
AND SO THE THE UTILITIES OF

02:39:30.794 --> 02:39:32.362
STEPPED UP IN A BIG WAY AND HAVE

02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:33.830
A GREAT VISION BUT THERE

02:39:33.897 --> 02:39:35.933
POPULATING THEIR TIER.

02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:37.434
TWO TIER THREE FIRE HAZARD

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:39.469
REGIONS AND THE MONEY WOULD BE

02:39:39.536 --> 02:39:41.038
TO POPULATE THE REST OF THE

02:39:41.104 --> 02:39:42.072
STATE WITH CAMERAS SO THAT WE

02:39:42.139 --> 02:39:43.974
HAVE A GOOD COVERAGE OF THE VIEW

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.108
SHED.

02:39:45.175 --> 02:39:46.510
IT IS YOUR PAIN IS A HUNDRED

02:39:46.576 --> 02:39:48.578
ADDITIONAL CAMERAS IS --

02:39:48.645 --> 02:39:51.014
IS ADEQUATE OR IS IT IS THERE A

02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:54.284
A PERFECT WORLD NUMBER WE SHOULD

02:39:54.351 --> 02:39:55.085
BE IT GETS OLDER SO WHAT WE'RE

02:39:55.152 --> 02:39:56.453
DOING WITH THESE --

02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:58.855
CHAIRMAN AS WE INSTALL THE

02:39:58.922 --> 02:40:00.757
CAMERAS AND TRY TO DETERMINE --

02:40:00.824 --> 02:40:03.493
THE VIEW SHEDS AN OPERATION AND

02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:05.963
SO THERE'S INSTALL ASSESS THEN

02:40:06.029 --> 02:40:07.064
FILL IN.

02:40:07.130 --> 02:40:07.965
SO -- RIGHT

02:40:08.031 --> 02:40:09.566
NOW WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:40:09.633 --> 02:40:12.836
CAMERAS TO GO IN AND TWENTY

02:40:12.903 --> 02:40:14.237
NINETEEN SO THAT'LL ADD THAT'S

02:40:14.304 --> 02:40:16.006
FUNDED BY UTILITIES.

02:40:16.073 --> 02:40:17.574
AND THEN THE HUNDRED CAMERAS TO

02:40:17.641 --> 02:40:19.876
PUT IN THE AREA WHERE IT'S

02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:21.278
OUTSIDE THEIR OPERATION.

02:40:21.345 --> 02:40:23.880
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT PROBABLY

02:40:23.947 --> 02:40:26.483
THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED CAMERAS BY

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:28.185
TWENTY NINETEEN MIDDLE.

02:40:28.251 --> 02:40:29.486
TWENTY TWENTY AND ON THE

02:40:29.553 --> 02:40:31.621
ESTIMATES VARY BUT WORKING

02:40:31.688 --> 02:40:32.756
THROUGH THE VIEW SHED AND

02:40:32.823 --> 02:40:34.858
TYPOGRAPHY WERE ENVISIONING

02:40:34.925 --> 02:40:39.963
PROBABLY ABOUT SIX HUNDRED

02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:40.464
CAMERAS FOR THE STATE OF

02:40:40.530 --> 02:40:43.400
CALIFORNIA.

02:40:43.467 --> 02:40:45.602
GIVEN ANSWERS WERE SO I WENT UP

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.504
TO THE THESE VIEW SHOWS ACTUALLY

02:40:47.571 --> 02:40:49.239
ARE WAS OF ALL ON THE MAP SO HE

02:40:49.306 --> 02:40:50.440
COULD SEE THE COVERAGE OF THE

02:40:50.507 --> 02:40:51.508
CAMERAS AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT

02:40:51.575 --> 02:40:52.909
THE DATA SYSTEM THAT CAN THEN

02:40:52.976 --> 02:40:54.444
JUSTICE CAMERAS AND OTHER FORMS

02:40:54.511 --> 02:40:56.947
OF SENSING PLATFORMS AND

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:57.881
INFORMATION THAT AMOUNT.

02:40:57.948 --> 02:40:59.716
THE SENSE DATA IS THERE IS A

02:40:59.783 --> 02:41:03.120
CAPABILITY THERE ARE TO BE ABLE.

02:41:03.186 --> 02:41:06.890
TO FILL IN THE BLANKS WITH

02:41:06.957 --> 02:41:09.626
DIFFERENT FORM --

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:11.128
OTHER FORMS OF INFORMATION CAN

02:41:11.194 --> 02:41:12.963
BE USE AN INFORMATION COULD BE

02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:15.232
MADE AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE ON

02:41:15.298 --> 02:41:16.967
THE FLY SO THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN

02:41:17.034 --> 02:41:18.402
BY CURATION AND CLEANING OFF

02:41:18.468 --> 02:41:19.669
THESE DATA SETS.

02:41:19.736 --> 02:41:21.071
AND SERVING THEM.

02:41:21.138 --> 02:41:22.739
SO THERE IS ALSO AN ABORTION TO

02:41:22.806 --> 02:41:24.841
USING THESE PAST FIVE YEARS AND

02:41:24.908 --> 02:41:26.443
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST

02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:27.844
UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THOSE

02:41:27.911 --> 02:41:29.913
CRITICAL PLACES TO PLACE THE

02:41:29.980 --> 02:41:32.449
CAMERAS AND STRATEGIC DEPLOYMENT

02:41:32.516 --> 02:41:35.852
AS POSSIBLE USING THIS TYPE OF

02:41:35.919 --> 02:41:37.721
DATA.

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:38.789
THANK YOU NAPA NAP I HAD YOU

02:41:38.855 --> 02:41:40.190
KNOW THESE FIRES A KEEP SPARKING

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.725
UP IN THE SAME AREAS THERE SEEMS

02:41:41.792 --> 02:41:42.626
TO BE.

02:41:42.692 --> 02:41:43.827
YOU KNOW CERTAIN VALLEY'S

02:41:43.894 --> 02:41:46.430
TOPOGRAPHY VENTURI EFFECT THESE

02:41:46.496 --> 02:41:48.632
DROPS AND AND THEY SEEM TO BE

02:41:48.698 --> 02:41:50.500
THE SAME IGNITION POINTS OVER

02:41:50.567 --> 02:41:51.668
AND OVER AGAIN.

02:41:51.735 --> 02:41:53.170
SO BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THESE

02:41:53.236 --> 02:41:56.206
AND AND TO GET EARLY THIS EARLY

02:41:56.273 --> 02:42:00.844
INCIPIENT FIRE PHASE IS CRITICAL.

02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:02.112
THANK YOU APPRECIATE THOSE

02:42:02.179 --> 02:42:05.348

02:42:34.444 --> 02:42:36.113
WE SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:42:36.179 --> 02:42:38.415
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY --

02:42:38.482 --> 02:42:40.050
THE WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT WHEN

02:42:40.117 --> 02:42:40.951
OUR COMMUNICATIONS

02:42:41.017 --> 02:42:43.386
INFRASTRUCTURE IS INEVITABLY

02:42:43.453 --> 02:42:45.789
COMPROMISED LIKE THE HUNDREDS OF

02:42:45.856 --> 02:42:47.224
TOWERS THAT WE'VE LOST.

02:42:47.290 --> 02:42:48.959
THAT THE STATE SHOULD HAVE --

02:42:49.025 --> 02:42:50.393
IN INFRASTRUCTURE INDEPENDENT

02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:52.395
OPTION THAT CAN BE ROLLED OUT

I'M TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:43:18.421 --> 02:43:20.290
THE TECHNOLOGY OF PREVENTING THE

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:21.258
IGNITION.

02:43:21.324 --> 02:43:22.459
SO PREVENTION IGNITION AS WE

02:43:22.526 --> 02:43:24.294
KNOW IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP

02:43:24.361 --> 02:43:25.795
IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION.

SOLUTION WHICH IS GREAT IGNITION

02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:34.638
SOURCE DETECTION WHICH

02:43:34.704 --> 02:43:36.139
IDENTIFIES GREAT EVENTS SUCH AS

02:43:36.206 --> 02:43:38.575
SPARKS AND VEGETATION CONTACT.

02:43:38.642 --> 02:43:39.910
THAT OFTEN LEAD TO WILD WILD

02:43:39.976 --> 02:43:41.011
FIRE IGNITION.

02:43:41.077 --> 02:43:42.479
THIS CAN TECHNOLOGY CAN FOCUS

02:43:42.546 --> 02:43:44.114
BOTH ON PREVENTIVE VEGETATION

02:43:44.181 --> 02:43:45.916

HE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE THE FIELD.

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:01.284
HE'S ABLE TO SEE THE FIRE HUSING

COULD GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF

02:46:13.863 --> 02:46:14.364
THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR

02:46:14.431 --> 02:46:15.332
INCIDENT.

WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE.

02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:25.175
WHAT THE DIRECTORS KIND OF RAW

02:46:25.241 --> 02:46:27.310
RESPONDED TO IS THE AMERICAN

02:46:27.377 --> 02:46:29.012
FIRE SERVICE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE

02:46:29.079 --> 02:46:30.547
A LOT OF OUR INDIE WHEN IT COMES

02:46:30.613 --> 02:46:31.915
TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE TO

02:46:31.981 --> 02:46:33.183
PARTNER WITH A PUBLIC PRIVATE

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:34.884

PLACES LIKE NASCAR BECAUSE THEY

02:46:40.023 --> 02:46:40.557
HAVE THE MONEY FOR OUR DAY ARE

02:46:40.623 --> 02:46:41.891
SELF CONTAINED BREATHING

02:46:41.958 --> 02:46:42.892
APPARATUS.

02:46:42.959 --> 02:46:44.828
COMES FROM NOW SO AND MINE

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:46.896

THE ACADEMICS FROM.

02:46:48.465 --> 02:46:49.466
THE FOLKS WHO SPOKE TODAY IS

02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:51.234
AMAZING THE SECOND THING THAT

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:53.002
THAT TECHNOLOGY DOES BESIDES

02:46:53.069 --> 02:46:54.738
LETTING YOU KNOW WERE FIRE IS SO

02:46:54.804 --> 02:46:56.439
YOU COULD AUGMENT RESOURCES

02:46:56.506 --> 02:46:57.640
PROPER RESOURCES.

02:46:57.707 --> 02:46:59.209
SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE

02:46:59.275 --> 02:47:00.577
SURE YOU GET THE RIGHT UNITS

02:47:00.643 --> 02:47:02.278
TYPE ONE ENGINES STRIKE TEAMS

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:03.780
FOR STRUCTURE PROTECTION TYPE

02:47:03.847 --> 02:47:06.015
THREE ENGINES DOZERS HAND CREWS

02:47:06.082 --> 02:47:07.784
AIRCRAFT ROAD RE FIXED WING.

02:47:07.851 --> 02:47:09.452
THE SECOND THING IT DOES IS

02:47:09.519 --> 02:47:10.520
WE'VE SEEN IT --

02:47:10.587 --> 02:47:12.355
ALSO WELL WORN OF ARSONS ARSON

02:47:12.422 --> 02:47:13.490
FIRES WHEN THERE'S A

02:47:13.556 --> 02:47:15.024
DIVERSIONARY FIRE LIT.

02:47:15.091 --> 02:47:16.960
ALL RESOURCES GO TO THAT FIRE

02:47:17.026 --> 02:47:18.561
LIKE MOTHS TO A FLAME AND I'VE

02:47:18.628 --> 02:47:20.330
SEEN THE CAMERA SHOW THAT

02:47:20.397 --> 02:47:21.865
SECONDARY FIRES HAVE BEEN LED TO

02:47:21.931 --> 02:47:24.968
TAKE ON HOMES AND THE THIRD

02:47:25.034 --> 02:47:25.735
THING.

02:47:25.802 --> 02:47:26.836
AND WE SEEN ON THE HOLY FIRE IN

02:47:26.903 --> 02:47:28.238
THE CANYON FIRE ONE CANYON FIRE

02:47:28.304 --> 02:47:30.206
TO IS REKINDLES REKINDLES ANY

02:47:30.273 --> 02:47:31.608
CELL VIDEO OF IT TODAY.

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:34.144
ARE ARE A BIG PROBLEM FIRES ONCE

02:47:34.210 --> 02:47:35.845
THEY'RE OUT IN THE AIR OF

02:47:35.912 --> 02:47:38.081
DROUGHT THEY DON'T STAY OUT THEY

02:47:38.148 --> 02:47:41.584
COULD SMOLDER UNDERGROUND IN OAK --

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:44.120
ROUTES AND SMILING FACE FOR MANY

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:45.054
MANY WEEKS UNTIL WE GET

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:47.357
MEASURABLE RAIN WHAT WE SAW IN

02:47:47.424 --> 02:47:49.225
THE HOLY FIRE WAS A RE CANDLE

02:47:49.292 --> 02:47:50.226
THAT NO ONE SAW.

02:47:50.293 --> 02:47:51.961
WAS IN FEDERAL LAND ABOUT TO

02:47:52.028 --> 02:47:54.731
TAKE OUT COUNTY ORIGIN

02:47:54.798 --> 02:47:56.699
SURROUNDING AREAS THEY WERE ABLE

02:47:56.766 --> 02:47:58.401
TO GET ON THE CAMERA'S ALERT THE

02:47:58.468 --> 02:48:00.470
LOCAL FIRE OF THORNY THAT THERE

02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.038
WAS A FIRE FEDERAL LAND AND

02:48:02.105 --> 02:48:03.273
AGAIN THREATENING STATE AND

02:48:03.339 --> 02:48:04.407
LOCAL AREAS.

02:48:04.474 --> 02:48:05.775
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NEVER

02:48:05.842 --> 02:48:07.877
HAD BEFORE IT'S A TOOL IN THE

02:48:07.944 --> 02:48:09.446
ARSENAL THAT I THINK CHANGES

02:48:09.512 --> 02:48:10.780
EVERYTHING IT'S KIND OF A GAME

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:13.249
CHANGER AS FAR AS OF THE

02:48:13.316 --> 02:48:14.951
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS ON FIRES

02:48:15.018 --> 02:48:15.852

REPRESENTING CAL FIRE LOCAL.

02:48:28.898 --> 02:48:29.632
TWO EIGHT EIGHT ONE I'M AFRAID

02:48:29.699 --> 02:48:31.067
HAVE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO

02:48:31.134 --> 02:48:32.702
REMEMBER THE BLUE RIBBON

02:48:32.769 --> 02:48:34.070
COMMISSIONS IN THE NINETIES AND

02:48:34.137 --> 02:48:36.506
THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION IN.

02:48:36.573 --> 02:48:37.106
TWO THOUSAND TWO GRAY DAVIS'S

02:48:37.173 --> 02:48:39.342
REPORT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE

02:48:39.409 --> 02:48:42.245
MAJOR REPORT AFTER THE FIRE IN

02:48:42.312 --> 02:48:42.812
TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE WHITE

02:48:42.879 --> 02:48:44.380
PAPERS IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:45.682
AND TWELVE IN THIS NEW REPORT

02:48:45.748 --> 02:48:47.016
THAT JUST CAME OUT.

02:48:47.083 --> 02:48:48.618
THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING

02:48:48.685 --> 02:48:49.319
ALTERNATELY.

02:48:49.385 --> 02:48:52.889
THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY IS GREAT WE

02:48:52.956 --> 02:48:54.424
WANTED IT'S HELPFUL.

02:48:54.491 --> 02:48:58.394
BUT IS THE DIRECTOR SAID ALSO.

02:48:58.461 --> 02:49:00.430
AIRPLANES AND HELICOPTERS DO NOT

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:02.065
PUT OUT FIRES.

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:03.366
THEY CAN PROVE THEY CAN STOP

02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:04.400
THEM IN THEIR TRACKS THEY CAN

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.002
KEEP THEM FROM SPREADING AS FAST

02:49:06.069 --> 02:49:07.036
AS THEY WOULD.

02:49:07.103 --> 02:49:08.805
BUT WHAT PUTS OUT THE FIRE OUR

02:49:08.872 --> 02:49:10.740
BOOTS ON THE GROUND OUR MEN AND

02:49:10.807 --> 02:49:12.075
WOMEN PUTTING OUT THE FIRES

02:49:12.141 --> 02:49:13.476
THEMSELVES.

02:49:13.543 --> 02:49:14.677
I WOULD REMIND THIS COMMITTEE

02:49:14.744 --> 02:49:17.413
THAT CAL FIRE HAS THIRTY ONE

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:18.548
FEWER.

02:49:18.615 --> 02:49:21.618
ENGINES THEN THEY HAD IN

02:49:21.684 --> 02:49:22.385
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THEY CAL

02:49:22.452 --> 02:49:24.888
FIRE HAS FEWER INDIVIDUALS TO

02:49:24.954 --> 02:49:26.422
DEAL WITH STATE RESPONSIBILITY

02:49:26.489 --> 02:49:28.458
AREA THEN THEY HAD A GENERATION

02:49:28.525 --> 02:49:29.492
AGO.

02:49:29.559 --> 02:49:30.727
I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING THIS YOU

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:31.828
KNOW MISTER CHAIRMAN GREAT

02:49:31.895 --> 02:49:33.897
QUESTIONS ON THE CAMERAS IT'D BE

02:49:33.963 --> 02:49:35.265
GREAT TO HAVE CAMERAS EVERYWHERE.

02:49:35.331 --> 02:49:38.768
AND WHILE THE MATH ISN'T EXACT

02:49:38.835 --> 02:49:41.638
CAL FIRE HAS ONE ENGINE FOR

02:49:41.704 --> 02:49:45.041
EVERY NINETY THOUSAND MILES A

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:47.143
STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

02:49:47.210 --> 02:49:48.411
SO AS WE PLAN ON THE FUTURE

02:49:48.478 --> 02:49:49.746
LET'S REMEMBER LET'S TAKE CARE

02:49:49.812 --> 02:49:51.281
OF WE NEED MORE PEOPLE WE NEED

02:49:51.347 --> 02:49:53.016
MORE ENGINES.

02:49:53.082 --> 02:49:54.617
IN TERMS OF THE INMATES.

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:55.785
THE INMATES DO THE JOB THAT THEY

02:49:55.852 --> 02:49:56.786
DO.

02:49:56.853 --> 02:49:58.788
BUT WE HAVE SPENT THE LAST

02:49:58.855 --> 02:50:00.290
SEVERAL YEARS EMPTY IN OUR

02:50:00.356 --> 02:50:01.457
PRISONS.

02:50:01.524 --> 02:50:02.992
SO THERE'S A REASON THAT WE HAVE

02:50:03.059 --> 02:50:05.562
THIRTY FEWER ENGINE THIRTY FEWER

02:50:05.628 --> 02:50:07.630
CREWS FROM THE STATE PRISONS AND

02:50:07.697 --> 02:50:09.566
IT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE

02:50:09.632 --> 02:50:11.568
PRISONERS WHO QUALIFY FOR THEM.

02:50:11.634 --> 02:50:13.069
AND AS WE CONTINUE TO EMPTY

02:50:13.136 --> 02:50:14.304
THOSE PRISONS WERE GOING TO LOSE

02:50:14.370 --> 02:50:16.139
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE NEED

02:50:16.205 --> 02:50:18.474
FIREFGHTERS WE NEED ENGINES

02:50:18.541 --> 02:50:20.376
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THAT HE THOUGHT THAT IS

02:51:13.997 --> 02:51:15.965
HAPPENING OKAY A WHAT WE REALLY

02:51:16.032 --> 02:51:17.467
NEED THINGS FROM USE THE SUPPORT

THESE PEOPLE TO REALLY TRUST ON

02:51:35.318 --> 02:51:36.919

02:51:38.554 --> 02:51:40.189
THAT THIS TRAINING OKAY.

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:40.823
THE SECOND THING THAT I WOULD

REALITY THAT IS HAPPENING IN

02:51:49.632 --> 02:51:51.034
CALIFORNIA.

02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:53.002
WHAT WE'RE LEAVING SOON IT IS A

02:51:53.069 --> 02:51:54.237
PLACE THAT?

02:51:54.303 --> 02:51:59.542
WITH ALL THIS CAMERA WE'RE GONNA

02:51:59.609 --> 02:52:00.643
SEE BURNING.

02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:02.211
PROBABLY IN THE NEXT TWENTY

02:52:02.278 --> 02:52:03.246

CITIZENS ARE TOOL KITS TO

02:52:09.519 --> 02:52:10.753
UNDERSTAND THAT WE LIVE IN A

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:12.321
PLACE WHERE THEY FIRE.

02:52:12.388 --> 02:52:13.756
YOU FIGHT FIRE.

THE FIRE YOU CHANGED OUR

02:52:20.763 --> 02:52:21.964
LANDSCAPE.

02:52:22.031 --> 02:52:22.799
