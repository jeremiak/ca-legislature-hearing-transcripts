TO REOPEN THE L. A. TIMES

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:10.324
EDITORIAL BOARD EVEN OPINES

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:12.993
THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SPEED

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:14.695

NOT DO THAT. AND IT CAN BE

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:31.478
DONE. THAT'S PUT FORTH A BILL

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.347

OUR LEGISLATION IS A WORK IN

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:07.748
PROGRESS. AS A TEACHER OVER

HIGH RIGHT NOW AND OUR DISTRICT

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.895
HAS BEEN BACK SINCE OCTOBER

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.131
GIVING THE PARENTS A CHOICE

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.065
WHETHER TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.745
WITH GETTING STUDENTS TO LOG ON

01:38:37.811 --> 01:38:39.246
GETTING STUDENTS TO TURN ON

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.715
THEIR CAMERAS. AND WHY BECAUSE

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.617

SCHOOLS. AND TO MAKE MATTERS

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:25.759
WORSE FOR SOME PARENTS IN MY

REOPEN FOR MONTHS BECAUSE OF

01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:48.415
THESE CONCERNS. IF WE HAD MORE

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:49.883

AND CHILDREN IN MY DISTRICT.

01:50:16.743 --> 01:50:17.444
THIS BILL WOULD ALSO ALLOW

01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:19.612
SCHOOLS ALREADY OPEN AND

01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:21.448
OFFERING TO CONTINUE TO DO SO

WITHOUT HAVING TO CLOSE.

01:50:24.184 --> 01:50:26.186
HOWEVER LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:26.920
CONTINUE TO NEED MORE

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:28.655

EIGHT DROPS SO WHAT DOES THAT

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:45.305
REALLY MEAN. THE SECOND PART OF

01:55:45.371 --> 01:55:46.973
THIS BILL THAT OUR COLLEAGUE

THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY WE OPEN

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:55.181

THAT CAME OUT A FEW WEEKS AGO.

01:56:04.657 --> 01:56:06.559
IS UNBELIEVABLY DAMAGING TALK

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:08.161
THAT THAT SHOWS THAT THAT WHAT

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:10.463
KIDS ARE ARE FALLING BEHIND

01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:11.898
WHICH KIDS ARE FALLING BEHIND.

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:13.833

LANGUAGE LEARNERS ARE LOW

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:17.503
INCOME STUDENTS. A FOSTER YOUTH

COMMUNITIES. THEY'RE LEARNING

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:21.741
LOSS IS SEVERE SO WE NEED TO

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:23.343
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T JUST.

01:56:23.409 --> 01:56:24.410
THINK THIS IS A PANACEA AND

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:26.179
MOVE ON. THIS LEARNING LOSS

01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:28.181
ISSUE IS REAL. WE DO HAVE FOUR

01:56:28.247 --> 01:56:29.916

FOCUSING ON IN PERSON BECAUSE-

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:38.024

ZOOM SCHOOL IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:43.629
SO WE NEED TO REALIZE THAT IS

01:56:43.696 --> 01:56:45.365
THERE IS A REALITY AND WE'RE

01:56:45.431 --> 01:56:46.599
GONNA BE LOOKING AT THIS AGAIN

01:56:46.666 --> 01:56:48.401
WHEN WE ADOPT OUR FINAL BUDGET

01:56:48.468 --> 01:56:49.969
IN A FEW WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE

REALIZING THIS LEARNING LOSS

01:56:58.978 --> 01:56:59.712

HEARING EVERYBODY SPEAK THAT.

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:51.664
JUST LIKE THIS PANDEMIC IN SO

02:02:51.731 --> 02:02:54.767
MUCH WE TALK ABOUT THAT WE ALL

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:55.301
KIND OF LIVE IN DIFFERENT

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:59.004
WORLDS- I LIKE MANY PEOPLE.

02:02:59.071 --> 02:03:00.773
HAVE BEEN HOME WITH MY KIDS-

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.842
FULL DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THE

02:03:02.908 --> 02:03:04.710
LAST YEAR. AND IT HASN'T BEEN

02:03:04.777 --> 02:03:08.047
EASY A THREE. KIDS AT HOME BOYS

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:10.483
M. ALL TRYING TO BE ON THEM AT

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:11.751
THE SAME TIME AND I KNOW THE

02:03:11.817 --> 02:03:14.386
CHALLENGES. BUT I ALSO LIVE IN

02:03:14.453 --> 02:03:16.355
A COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN

02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:18.457
HARDEST HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC.

02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:21.660
AND THAT THE FEAR OF PARENTS

02:03:21.727 --> 02:03:24.563
AND TEACHERS RETURNING ISRAEL.

02:03:24.630 --> 02:03:26.332
IT'S A REAL FEAR BECAUSE OF

02:03:26.398 --> 02:03:28.634
SOMEBODY BRINGS HOME COALBED

02:03:28.701 --> 02:03:31.370
SOMEBODY MAY DIE. IT'S NOT JUST

02:03:31.437 --> 02:03:34.140
A NASTY FLU IT IS DEATH THE

02:03:34.206 --> 02:03:36.642
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE HAVE THE

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:37.977
HIGHEST COVERT RATES THE

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.578
HIGHEST DEATH RATES IN THE

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:41.514
LOWEST VACCINATION RATES SO I

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:43.449
KNOW PEOPLE REALLY ANXIOUS TO

02:03:43.516 --> 02:03:45.050
GET THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL

02:03:45.117 --> 02:03:46.886
IN EVERY COMMUNITY. BUT THERE

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:49.455
IS JUSTIFIABLE FEAR IN SOME OF

02:03:49.522 --> 02:03:52.625
OURS. AND SO I'M OF COURSE

02:03:52.691 --> 02:03:54.160
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL WE HAVE

02:03:54.226 --> 02:03:55.494
TO DO SOMETHING WE HAVE TO MOVE

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:56.662
FORWARD I'M REALLY EXCITED

02:03:56.729 --> 02:03:57.830
ABOUT SOME THE LEARNING

02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.165
RECOVERY LANGUAGE WE GOT IN

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:00.399
HERE THAT WAS YOU KNOW THE

02:04:00.466 --> 02:04:01.867
PIECE THAT THAT I WAS SO

02:04:01.934 --> 02:04:03.035
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT'S NOT

02:04:03.102 --> 02:04:04.537
ENOUGH OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA

02:04:04.603 --> 02:04:05.204
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO REVISIT

02:04:05.271 --> 02:04:07.473
THIS BUT- I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:08.007
SOMETHING BUT THERE ARE A

02:04:08.073 --> 02:04:09.575
COUPLE THINGS I JUST. WANT TO

02:04:09.642 --> 02:04:12.244
POINT OUT. THERE WERE

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:14.446
NEGOTIATIONS MADE BASED ON TIER

02:04:14.513 --> 02:04:15.047
SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING CHANGED

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:18.050
NOW. IT'S KINDA NOT FAIR YOU

02:04:18.117 --> 02:04:19.652
KNOW I JUST WANNA BE REALLY

02:04:19.718 --> 02:04:20.619
HONEST SO WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE

02:04:20.686 --> 02:04:21.787
THE TEARS AND SUDDENLY

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:23.455
EVERYBODY'S AND READ HERE THAT

02:04:23.522 --> 02:04:24.890
CHANGES THE CLASSES THAT HAVE

02:04:24.957 --> 02:04:26.826
TO BE OPEN THAT NUMBER CLASSES

02:04:26.892 --> 02:04:30.029
IN THE TESTING CADENCES. SO IF

02:04:30.095 --> 02:04:32.097
YOU GET CALLS FROM YOUR

02:04:32.164 --> 02:04:33.566
TEACHERS UNION A LITTLE UPSET

02:04:33.632 --> 02:04:34.834
THEY THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.268
UPSET YOU DON'T NEGOTIATED DEAL

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:37.503
AND THEN CHANGE THE PARAMETERS

02:04:37.570 --> 02:04:38.871
THAT DEAL ON THE DAY THAT WE'RE

02:04:38.938 --> 02:04:40.239
VOTING ON IT AND I THINK THAT'S

02:04:40.306 --> 02:04:42.374
JUST WEEK WE HAVE TO BE HONEST

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:43.876
ABOUT THAT IT'S A LITTLE.

02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:46.245
DISHONEST WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE

02:04:46.312 --> 02:04:47.313
OTHER THING I WANT TO LINE MY

02:04:47.379 --> 02:04:48.981
COMMENTS WITH. MY COLLEAGUES

02:04:49.048 --> 02:04:51.150
FROM SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. IF YOU

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:53.285
LIVE IN A DISTRICT. WHERE THE

02:04:53.352 --> 02:04:55.487
COUNTY IS SURE MOVING INTO THE

02:04:55.554 --> 02:04:57.423
RED HERE. BUT IT'S YOUR PORTION

02:04:57.489 --> 02:04:58.424
OF THE COUNTY THAT'S PULLING

02:04:58.490 --> 02:05:00.192
EVERYBODY DOWN. I GUARANTEE YOU

02:05:00.259 --> 02:05:02.127
I DON'T HAVE THE SAME RATES. AS

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:03.829
MY COLLEAGUE FROM INSIDIOUS. WE

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:06.932
HAVE ALL THE CASES IN OUR-

02:05:06.999 --> 02:05:09.768
IT'LL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO WE

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:12.605
ARE BEING PULLED INTO THE RED

02:05:12.671 --> 02:05:13.906
BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE AS

02:05:13.973 --> 02:05:16.342
MANY CASES AND IT DOES. CREATE

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:18.677
A DISTURBANCE NOW I'VE TALKED

02:05:18.744 --> 02:05:19.612
TO EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:20.479
DISTRICT AND THEY'RE WORKING

02:05:20.546 --> 02:05:22.615
HARD THEY HAVE BEEN. RE OPENING

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:24.149
PLANS A MEETING WITH THE

02:05:24.216 --> 02:05:25.885
TEACHERS UNION THEY THEY HAVE.

02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:28.687
A PLAN SET. BUT THEY'RE GOING

02:05:28.754 --> 02:05:29.788
TO MISS OUT ON THE FIRST WEEKS

02:05:29.855 --> 02:05:31.724
OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY WERE

02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:32.291
ALREADY WORKING ON AN APRIL

02:05:32.358 --> 02:05:34.460
TWELFTH ST. SO ALTHOUGH WE TALK

02:05:34.526 --> 02:05:36.862
A LOT ABOUT EQUITY IN THIS

02:05:36.929 --> 02:05:39.064
HOUSE IF YOU WILL. WHEN IT

02:05:39.131 --> 02:05:39.865
COMES DOWN TO ACTUALLY

02:05:39.932 --> 02:05:41.533
DISTURBING FUNDS WE END UP

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.434
PUTTING IN RULES THAT

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:44.737
SOMETIMES. MEAN THOSE WITH THE

02:05:44.803 --> 02:05:48.007
LEAST STILL GET THE LEAST. AND

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:48.607
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:49.875
THEY WILL ALL BE PENALIZED

02:05:49.942 --> 02:05:50.743
BECAUSE NONE OF THEM WILL BE

02:05:50.809 --> 02:05:53.212
ABLE TO OPEN UP. ON THE DATE

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:55.848
THAT WAS SET IN THIS BILL. OKAY

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:57.316
STILL SUPPORT THE BILL THESE

02:05:57.383 --> 02:05:59.184
ARE THE PROBLEMS. AND I SUPPORT

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:01.887
THE BILL BECAUSE I HOPE. THAT

02:06:01.954 --> 02:06:02.488
THIS ISN'T THE LAST TIME WE'RE

02:06:02.554 --> 02:06:05.090
TALKING ABOUT THIS. RIGHT AS

02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:08.427
MUCH AS- AS WE GOT INTO THIS

02:06:08.494 --> 02:06:10.162
BILL ESPECIALLY LEARNING LOSS

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:11.230
AND LEARNING RECOVERY MONEY AND

02:06:11.297 --> 02:06:12.364
THAT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT IT'S

02:06:12.431 --> 02:06:14.133
NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. THE

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.601
DISPARITIES THAT CONTINUE TO

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:16.869
EXIST IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

02:06:16.936 --> 02:06:18.871
HAVE GROWN EXPONENTIALLY DURING

02:06:18.938 --> 02:06:21.807
THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE WE ARE WE

02:06:21.874 --> 02:06:23.175
DO HAVE MONEY AVAILABLE BUT

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:24.643
IT'S AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:26.345
IT'S NOT FULLY TARGETED TO

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:27.746
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT

02:06:27.813 --> 02:06:29.481
THE MOST ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:31.183
EQUITABLE A MORE EQUITABLE

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:32.751
DISTRIBUTION. THEN THE

02:06:32.818 --> 02:06:35.287
DISTRIBUTING IT EQUALLY BECAUSE

02:06:35.354 --> 02:06:35.888
WE'RE LOOKING AT FORMULAS THAT

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:37.856
ARE MORE EQUITABLE. WE NEED

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.058
MORE AND I'M JUST GONNA BE VERY

02:06:39.124 --> 02:06:40.092
HONEST ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I

02:06:40.159 --> 02:06:41.827
KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY MEMBER ON

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:43.128
THIS FLOOR WHO'S GOING TO SAY

02:06:43.195 --> 02:06:44.596
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WE NEED

02:06:44.663 --> 02:06:46.465
MORE WE NEED MORE TARGETED

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:47.833
MONEY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE

02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:49.234
BECAUSE IF YOU THOUGHT THERE

02:06:49.301 --> 02:06:50.970
WAS AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP BEFORE.

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:52.538
YOU GUYS WERE GONNA BE PAYING

02:06:52.604 --> 02:06:56.208
FOR THIS FOR TEN YEARS. IT AND

02:06:56.275 --> 02:06:58.844
THERE HAVE BEEN KIDS LITERALLY

02:06:58.911 --> 02:07:00.946
WHO HAVE NEVER LOGGED ON IN MY

02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:04.049
DISTRICT. WE NEED TO DO MORE

02:07:04.116 --> 02:07:05.117
THAN SIMPLY SAY WE CAN CATCH

02:07:05.184 --> 02:07:07.920
THEM UP WE NEED TO PASS A BILL

02:07:07.987 --> 02:07:09.855
THAT ALLOWS PARENTS THE RIGHT.

02:07:09.922 --> 02:07:10.923
TO HAVE THEIR KID REDO THE

02:07:10.990 --> 02:07:12.858
GREAT THIRTY SECONDS WE NEED TO

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.660
ENSURE THAT PARENTS HAVE THE

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:17.763
ABILITY TO INTERVENE ON BEHALF

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:19.665
OF THEIR CHILDREN. BECAUSE SOME

02:07:19.732 --> 02:07:20.733
PEOPLE IT'S NOT THAT THE

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:21.667
TEACHERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:23.769
THEY HAVE BUT WE NEED TO DO

02:07:23.836 --> 02:07:26.205
MORE FOR KIDS BECAUSE SOME OF

02:07:26.271 --> 02:07:27.706
OUR KIDS GOT NOTHING THIS PAST

02:07:27.773 --> 02:07:29.875
YEAR. SO I JUST I HOPE WELL

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:31.043
ALTHOUGH FOR THIS AND I HOPE

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:32.611
WILL COME BACK AND CONTINUE TO

02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:34.580
ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES THAT

02:07:34.646 --> 02:07:37.383
HAVE GROWN IN TRULY INSURE OVER

02:07:37.449 --> 02:07:38.117
THE NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WE'RE

02:07:38.183 --> 02:07:39.418
PUTTING MORE MONEY AND TARGETED

02:07:39.485 --> 02:07:42.321
MONEY AT THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:42.921
HAVE BEEN HURT THE MOST. THANK

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:44.289
YOU. THANK YOU MISS CONSEILS

02:07:44.356 --> 02:07:46.058

RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:50.829
YOU MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN

02:07:50.896 --> 02:07:53.165
SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX WHICH

02:07:53.232 --> 02:07:54.867
THEY'RE NOT PERFECT WILL HELP

02:07:54.933 --> 02:07:57.836
MORE SCHOOLS OPEN SAFELY. I

02:07:57.903 --> 02:07:59.338
HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THIS

02:07:59.405 --> 02:08:01.440
AGREEMENT BECAUSE ITIS IN FACT

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:03.642
FAR FROM PERFECT THE BILL DOES

02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:05.711
NOT GO FAR ENOUGH TO HELP

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:08.380
REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS PARTICULARLY

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:10.349
OUR MIDDLE. AND HIGH SCHOOLS

02:08:10.416 --> 02:08:12.051
ADDITIONALLY I WISH WE HAD THE

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:14.053
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:15.721
NECESSARY AMENDMENTS TO THIS

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.189
BILL THAT WOULD PERMIT OUR

02:08:17.256 --> 02:08:19.358
SCHOOLS TO BETTER SERVE THEIR

02:08:19.425 --> 02:08:22.261
STUDENTS IN PERSON. EVEN SO

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:24.096
THIS BILL DOES GIVE AN

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:25.798
INCENTIVE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN

02:08:25.864 --> 02:08:27.833
AND IT PROVIDES RESOURCES TO

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.301
AID THE TRANSITION TO IN PERSON

02:08:29.368 --> 02:08:31.603
INSTRUCTION. IT ALSO MAKES

02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:32.838
PROGRESS IN VACCINATING OUR

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:35.307
TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF WHICH

02:08:35.374 --> 02:08:36.308
IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS

02:08:36.375 --> 02:08:39.578
PUZZLE. TO ME THIS BILL IS A

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:41.380
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

02:08:41.447 --> 02:08:43.148
DISTANCE LEARNING IS HARMING

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:45.818
OUR KIDS IN WAYS THAT WE MAY

02:08:45.884 --> 02:08:47.986
NEVER BE ABLE TO QUANTIFY. AND

02:08:48.053 --> 02:08:49.955
EVERY STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS

02:08:50.022 --> 02:08:53.459
A RIGHT TO A QUALITY EDUCATION

02:08:53.525 --> 02:08:57.629
QUALITY IS KEY AND THUS IN

02:08:57.696 --> 02:08:58.197
PERSON LEARNING SHOULD BE A

02:08:58.263 --> 02:09:01.967
RIGHT. ABRAHAM LINCOLN. WHOSE

AS I AM. AND I CAN TELL YOU IT

02:10:30.756 --> 02:10:33.892

HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN OUR WHAT

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:41.333
HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING. IN OUR

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:42.301
SCHOOLS TO HAVE A MY OLDEST

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:44.336
DAUGHTER NOT BE ABLE TO FINISH

02:10:44.403 --> 02:10:45.971
EIGHTH GRADE YEAR NOT TO HAVE A

02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:50.108
GRADUATION. AND A START

02:10:50.175 --> 02:10:52.177
FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:10:52.244 --> 02:10:52.911
COMPLETELY ON DISTANCE

02:10:52.978 --> 02:10:55.013
LEARNING. FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS

02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.116
AND MONTHS. HAVE TO MISS OUT ON

02:10:58.183 --> 02:10:59.885
THAT INTERACTION THAT SHE HAS

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.387
WITH HER TO SEE THE AFFECT. ON

02:11:02.454 --> 02:11:05.624
HER MENTAL HEALTH. AND SO I

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:09.428
THINK. WE HAVE TO HAVE A SOBER

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:11.830
ASSESSMENT HERE TODAY AND WE

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.465
HAVE TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:17.436
GETS AN F. IT GETS AN F. IN HOW

02:11:17.502 --> 02:11:19.504
IT DEALT WITH EDUCATION.

02:11:19.571 --> 02:11:21.540
CALIFORNIA DEEMED EDUCATION NOT

02:11:21.607 --> 02:11:25.410
ESSENTIAL. THAT'S A FACT WE GET

02:11:25.477 --> 02:11:30.549
MANY INDUSTRIES GOING OPERATING.

02:11:30.616 --> 02:11:32.584
WE DEEM THOSE INDUSTRIES AS

02:11:32.651 --> 02:11:35.187
CENTRAL AND WE DEEM SCHOOLS AND

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:37.556
SMALL BUSINESSES IN OTHER

02:11:37.623 --> 02:11:39.391
INDUSTRIES NOT A CENTRAL. AND

02:11:39.458 --> 02:11:41.960
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. AND IT'S

02:11:42.027 --> 02:11:45.364
A TRAVESTY. THAT THAT HAPPENED

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:51.003
ON OUR WATCH. NO LONGER BE FAIR

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:52.771
I THINK THE LION'S SHARE OF THE

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:55.207
BLAME GOES WITH THIS GOVERNOR.

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:56.708
BECAUSE THE REASON THAT YOUR

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:58.744
SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN RIGHT NOW.

02:11:58.810 --> 02:11:59.311
THE REASON WHY THE GENTLEMAN

02:11:59.378 --> 02:12:01.380
FROM SACRAMENTO IN MY HOME

02:12:01.446 --> 02:12:02.881
SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE NOT OPEN

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:04.349
RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:12:04.416 --> 02:12:07.352
BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK. SCHOOLS

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:09.221
THAT WANT TO OPEN CANNOT OPEN

02:12:09.288 --> 02:12:11.056
BECAUSE THEY'RE IN PURPLE TAR.

02:12:11.123 --> 02:12:12.391
AND THE GOVERNOR IS THE ONE WHO

02:12:12.457 --> 02:12:13.859
ESTABLISHED THAT POLICY NOT

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:16.962
WITH US. NOT IN THROUGH A DUE

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:20.332
PROCESS LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.

02:12:20.399 --> 02:12:22.100
THAT SHOULD BE THE WAY THAT

02:12:22.167 --> 02:12:24.202
POLICIES ARE ENACTED. IN A

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:27.005
DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. BUT BY

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:28.006
ONE MAN MAKING ALL THOSE

02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.875
DECISIONS AND THAT IS THE

02:12:29.941 --> 02:12:31.576
REASON THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE

02:12:31.643 --> 02:12:33.045
STILL CLOSED IN MANY

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:33.812
COMMUNITIES IN FAR TOO MANY

02:12:33.879 --> 02:12:35.847
COMMUNITIES IS BECAUSE OF THE

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:37.349
BLUEPRINT FRAMEWORK AND THE

02:12:37.416 --> 02:12:39.151
AUDACITY OF THIS MAN TO THEN

02:12:39.217 --> 02:12:41.753
BLAME US. TO THEM BLAME THE

02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.888
LEGISLATURE AND SAY WE'RE

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:44.956
DRAGGING OUR FEET WHEN HE'S THE

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:46.425
ONE WHO HAS KEPT THEM CLOSED.

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:50.595
THIS WHOLE TIME. AND IF YOU USE

02:12:50.662 --> 02:12:52.130
THAT ARBITRARY POWER HE COULD

02:12:52.197 --> 02:12:54.766
OPEN SCHOOLS TOMORROW. BUT HE

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.069
IS NOT. THAT IS THE REASON WHY

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:58.704
WE WERE IN THE SITUATION THAT

02:12:58.770 --> 02:12:59.771
WE FIND OURSELVES AND WE ALL

02:12:59.838 --> 02:13:02.307
HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS. BUT LOOK

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:04.009
FOLKS LET'S BE HONEST THE CDC

02:13:04.076 --> 02:13:06.044
IN DECEMBER SAID THAT WE COULD

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:08.380
OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY IN DECEMBER.

02:13:08.447 --> 02:13:10.982
AND HERE WE ARE IN MARCH.

02:13:11.049 --> 02:13:12.918
DEBATING AND FINALLY PASSING

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:13.752
SOME LEGISLATION THAT LOOK AT

02:13:13.819 --> 02:13:17.956

SOME OPENED IN APRIL. IN A

02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.462
HYBRID MODEL THAT WE'VE ALL

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:25.163
TALKED ABOUT IS DOES NOT WORK

02:13:25.230 --> 02:13:29.368
FOR WORKING PARENTS. YEAH

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:31.236
THAT'S EASY FOR WORKING PARENTS

02:13:31.303 --> 02:13:31.837
TO SAY OKAY I'M GONNA GO HALF

02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:34.639

WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE SOLVED ALL

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:47.219

IT DEALT WITH EDUCATION PERIOD.

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:56.361
AND IT'S BEEN DEVASTATING WE

02:13:56.428 --> 02:13:56.928
ARE GOING TO BE LIVING WITH

02:13:56.995 --> 02:14:02.934
THIS. FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.

02:14:03.001 --> 02:14:03.468
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SOBRE

02:14:06.071 --> 02:14:07.406
WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

OF THOSE SCHOOLS IN THOSE RURAL

02:14:17.249 --> 02:14:18.550
AREAS ACTUALLY TOOK THE MONEY

02:14:18.617 --> 02:14:19.785
FROM LAST YEAR AND THEY RE

02:14:19.851 --> 02:14:21.453
OPENED AND THEY SPENT THE MONEY

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.722

02:14:23.789 --> 02:14:25.490
IT TAKES TO HELP REOPEN THE

SCHOOL SAFELY. AND THEY SPEND

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:29.428
IT AND SOME OF THE LARGER URBAN

02:14:29.494 --> 02:14:31.863

MY RULES ARE GOING TO GET SHORT

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:40.539

02:16:51.269 --> 02:16:54.005
DON'T SIT AROUND AND NEGOTIATE

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:54.539
ABOUT WHETHER TO OPEN THE

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:57.542
SCHOOL BACK UP. IT JUST OPENS.

02:16:57.609 --> 02:17:01.646
THAT'S WHAT IT'S THERE FOR. NOW

02:17:01.713 --> 02:17:02.213
THIS VIRUS OF COURSE HAS NOT

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:05.417
DISAPPEARED. FAR FROM IT BUT

02:17:05.483 --> 02:17:07.953
WHAT VANISHED LONG AGO WAS ON

02:17:08.019 --> 02:17:10.255
THE ONE HAND ANY PRETENSE THAT

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.723
THE OPERATION OF SCHOOLS PLAYS

02:17:11.790 --> 02:17:12.924
A MEANINGFUL ROLE IN

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:13.959
TRANSMISSION AND ON THE OTHER

02:17:14.025 --> 02:17:17.228
HAND ANY DOUBT THAT THE CLOSURE

02:17:17.295 --> 02:17:21.466
OF SCHOOLS DOES SEARING HARM.

02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:23.268
THAT HARM IS ESTABLISHED NOT

02:17:23.335 --> 02:17:25.036
JUST BY THE UNIMPEACHABLE

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:27.372
FINDINGS OF STUDY AFTER STUDY

02:17:27.439 --> 02:17:28.373
BUT BY THE TRAGIC LIVED

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.008
EXPERIENCE OF FAMILY AFTER

02:17:30.075 --> 02:17:33.445
FAMILY. IT IS DECISIONS BY

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:36.014
PEOPLE IN THIS BUILDING. AND

02:17:36.081 --> 02:17:38.416
ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR. THAT

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:40.885
IS BRINGING DEVASTATION

02:17:40.952 --> 02:17:44.456
DEPRESSION LOSS AND DEATH THE

02:17:44.522 --> 02:17:47.959
KIDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE

02:17:48.026 --> 02:17:49.394
ARE KILLING OUR KIDS FOR

02:17:49.461 --> 02:17:54.399
NOTHING. WE ARE KILLING OUR

02:17:54.466 --> 02:17:59.971
KIDS FOR NO GOOD REASON. GAVIN

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:01.239
NEWSOM'S MONSTROUS SCHOOL

02:18:01.306 --> 02:18:03.208
CLOSURES ARE AMONG THE GREATEST

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:04.175
GOVERNMENT CRIMES OF THE TWENTY

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:06.344
FIRST CENTURY AT LEAST IN THE

02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:09.614
NOMINALLY DEMOCRATIC WORLD. AND

02:18:09.681 --> 02:18:10.448
THIS LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN

02:18:10.515 --> 02:18:13.385
COMPLICIT. SURRENDERING TO THE

02:18:13.451 --> 02:18:13.952
SAME SPECIAL INTEREST IS THE

02:18:14.019 --> 02:18:18.123
GOVERNOR. PARENTS OF YOUNG KIDS

02:18:18.189 --> 02:18:19.491
HAVE GONE FROM HAVING TO

02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:21.226
EXPLAIN WHAT A VIRUSES TO

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:22.594
HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT

02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:26.331
CORRUPTION IS. THERE'S AN

02:18:26.398 --> 02:18:28.266
EDITORIAL IN TODAY'S LA TIMES

02:18:28.333 --> 02:18:30.335
HEADLINED SORRY WITH THE

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:31.736
STATE'S NEWEST DEAL ON SCHOOL

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:33.672
RE OPENING WON'T SPEED THINGS

02:18:33.738 --> 02:18:36.408
MUCH. THE TIME SAYS THAT THEY

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:37.042
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF

02:18:37.108 --> 02:18:38.943
MONTHS AGO. BUT INSTEAD THE

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:41.246
GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND MOST

02:18:41.312 --> 02:18:43.314
SCHOOL DISTRICTS A CENTRALLY

02:18:43.381 --> 02:18:44.482
ELECTED TO THE UNIONS TO THE

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:47.652
SIDE. THE RESULTS SADLY CHAU OR

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:49.654
EDUCATION LIES IN THE STATE'S

02:18:49.721 --> 02:18:52.657
PRIORITIES. I PREPARED AN

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:55.026
AMENDMENT FOR TODAY. THE FALL

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:56.928
OF THE SCIENCE AND OPEN SCHOOLS

02:18:56.995 --> 02:18:59.364
AS OTHER STATES HAVE. BUT THAT

02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:01.032
AMENDMENT FAILED IN THE SENATE

02:19:01.099 --> 02:19:01.866
THIS MORNING AND NOW THIS

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:04.569
ASSEMBLY IS GOING TO PASS A

02:19:04.636 --> 02:19:06.404
BILL THAT DOESN'T GUARANTEE IN

02:19:06.471 --> 02:19:08.173
PERSON INSTRUCTION FOR ONE

02:19:08.239 --> 02:19:10.542
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THERE IS

02:19:10.608 --> 02:19:12.043
NO ESCAPING THE SINGLE

02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:14.479
BRUTALIZING FACT THAT WE HAVE

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:16.448
THE POWER TO END THIS MADNESS

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:19.551
AND A REFUSING TO DO SO. WE'RE

02:19:19.617 --> 02:19:22.087
THE BAD SAMARITAN A PARABLE.

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:23.988
WALKING BY A SWIMMING POOL

02:19:24.055 --> 02:19:26.391
SEEING A CHILD DROWNING AND

02:19:26.458 --> 02:19:29.994
GOING ON WITH OUR DAY. I'M NOT

02:19:30.061 --> 02:19:31.996
ASKING ANYONE HERE TO BE A HERO.

02:19:32.063 --> 02:19:33.732
NOT ASKING YOU TO DIVE IN

02:19:33.798 --> 02:19:34.299
HEADFIRST AND RUFFLE UP YOUR

02:19:34.365 --> 02:19:37.302
SUIT. I'M JUST ASKING THAT WE

02:19:37.368 --> 02:19:39.738
THROW IN A LIFE PRESERVER. WE

02:19:39.804 --> 02:19:42.507
FIND A DASH OF HUMAN DECENCY IN

02:19:42.574 --> 02:19:44.609
A CAPITAL OR DECENCY HAS NEVER

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:48.079
BEEN IN SHORTER SUPPLY. MISTER

02:19:48.146 --> 02:19:57.288
MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:19:57.355 --> 02:20:00.859
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

02:20:00.925 --> 02:20:02.494
MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:04.329
READING A LETTER FROM ONE OF MY

02:20:04.395 --> 02:20:05.330

THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME.

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:15.306
TO LISTEN AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

02:20:15.373 --> 02:20:17.075
BASED ON THE INPUT FROM

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:18.443
EDUCATION LEADERS ACROSS THE

02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:21.813
STATE. I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.982
MADE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR

02:20:24.048 --> 02:20:26.618
SCHOOLS TO BRING STUDENTS BACK

02:20:26.684 --> 02:20:28.820
TO CAMPUS AND DO SO IN A SAFE

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:32.924
WAY. TULARE COUNTY APPRECIATES

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.559

COMMON GOAL. OF SAFE IN PERSON

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:46.905
INSTRUCTION. THOSE SCHOOLS THAT

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:48.573
ARE ALREADY PROVIDING IN PERSON

02:20:48.640 --> 02:20:51.209
INSTRUCTION WILL ALSO BENEFIT

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:53.845
FROM THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVE

02:20:53.912 --> 02:20:55.814
AND WILL BE ABLE TO ADD MORE

02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.315
STUDENTS AS PARENTS BECOME MORE

02:20:57.382 --> 02:21:00.185
CONFIDENT. IN THE SAFETY OF

FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN. MEMBERS

02:21:15.066 --> 02:21:17.402
LOCAL SUPERINTENDENTS. AND

02:21:17.468 --> 02:21:19.904
PARENTS I WANT TO THANK THEM

02:21:19.971 --> 02:21:20.772
FOR ALL THE HARD WORK THAT

02:21:20.839 --> 02:21:22.607
THEY'VE PUT IN OVER THESE LAST

02:21:22.674 --> 02:21:24.742
SEVERAL WEEKS PUSHING AND

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:27.045
FIGHTING FOR AMENDMENTS TO MAKE

02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:31.883
THIS A BETTER BILL. HOWEVER. MY

02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:33.718
SUPPORT DOES NOT COME WITHOUT A

02:21:33.785 --> 02:21:37.021
SENSE OF CAUTION. AS WE ARE ALL

02:21:37.088 --> 02:21:40.325
AWARE THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:42.227
ONE OF THE BIGGEST BILLS WILL

02:21:42.293 --> 02:21:44.495
BE VOTING ON THIS YEAR. WITH

02:21:44.562 --> 02:21:48.733
THAT BEING SAID. I DID NOT COME

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:52.437
TO MY SUPPORT LIGHTLY. I'M

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:53.504
GRATEFUL THAT THIS BILL GOES A

02:21:53.571 --> 02:21:55.673
LONG WAY TO FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS

02:21:55.740 --> 02:21:57.275
TO ENSURE THAT THIS RE OPENING

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:59.377
PROCESS IS NOT FINANCIALLY

02:21:59.444 --> 02:22:03.147
BURDENSOME. NOR ARE THE TESTING

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:03.715
REQUIREMENTS THAT COME ALONG

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:08.253
WITH IT. I'M ALSO PLEASED THAT

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:09.921
WE MANAGE TO REMOVE THE

02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:11.890
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:15.226
PORTION OF THIS BILL. ANY ROAD

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:18.029
BLOCK TO RE OPENING SIMPLY

02:22:18.096 --> 02:22:21.900
HARMS OUR STUDENTS FARTHER.

02:22:21.966 --> 02:22:26.771
LET'S BE CLEAR. OUR STUDENTS.

02:22:26.838 --> 02:22:30.275
ARE SUFFERING WITHOUT ACCESS TO

02:22:30.341 --> 02:22:33.011
EDUCATION OR SPORTS. FRANKLY

02:22:33.077 --> 02:22:35.113
THIS PERIOD OF TIME IN OUR

02:22:35.179 --> 02:22:36.981
HISTORY HAS BEEN THE WORST FOR

02:22:37.048 --> 02:22:40.151
THEM EVER. TOO MANY OF OUR

02:22:40.218 --> 02:22:42.186
STUDENTS HAVE ALREADY FALLEN

02:22:42.253 --> 02:22:45.390
INTO GANGS DRUGS OR WORSE

02:22:45.456 --> 02:22:50.662
SUICIDE. THESE HAVE ALL BEEN.

02:22:50.728 --> 02:22:52.830
PERPETRATED BY THIS OVERLY

02:22:52.897 --> 02:22:58.303
BURDENSOME CLOSURE OF OUR STATE.

02:22:58.369 --> 02:23:00.371
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL STILL

02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:02.874
LACKS SOME KEY COMPONENTS. I'M

02:23:02.941 --> 02:23:04.776
STILL VERY TROUBLED BY THE FACT

02:23:04.842 --> 02:23:06.711
THAT THIS PLAN DOES LITTLE TO

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:08.980
NOTHING TO BRING OUR MIDDLE AND

02:23:09.047 --> 02:23:10.481
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS BACK. INTO

02:23:10.548 --> 02:23:15.186
THE CLASSROOM. I AM FOR US TO

02:23:15.253 --> 02:23:17.855
CONTINUE WORKING. ON THIS ISSUE

02:23:17.922 --> 02:23:21.092
TO ENSURE ALL. OF OUR CHILDREN

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:22.994
CAN RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM AS

02:23:23.061 --> 02:23:26.331
SOON AS POSSIBLE. SADLY WE CAN

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:27.799
ONLY VOTE ON WHAT IS BEFORE US

02:23:27.865 --> 02:23:32.337
TODAY. WALDSCHMIDT THIS BILL IS

02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:34.172
AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE PREVIOUS

02:23:34.238 --> 02:23:37.175
VERSION. I AM ADMITTEDLY

02:23:37.241 --> 02:23:38.676
SKEPTICAL OF OUR

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.545
ADMINISTRATION'S ABILITY TO

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:44.215
ENACT THIS BILL. LET US ALL BE

02:23:44.282 --> 02:23:47.485
CLEAR MEMBERS. THIS PROBLEM

02:23:47.552 --> 02:23:49.754
THAT WE'RE AIMING TO SOLVE HERE

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:52.724
IS NOT CAUSED BY US. NOR SHOULD

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.859
THIS SOLUTION WE'VE ALL WORKED

02:23:54.926 --> 02:23:58.529
SO HARD ON. YOU SEEN AS A FIX

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:01.666
BY OUR GOVERNOR. RATHER THIS

02:24:01.733 --> 02:24:03.501
PROBLEM HAS BEEN PERPETRATED BY

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:07.305
OUR GOVERNOR OVER THE PAST YEAR.

02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:07.905
IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING TO

02:24:07.972 --> 02:24:11.376
ME. THERE WERE HAVING TO VOTE

02:24:11.442 --> 02:24:11.909
ON A MEASURE TO REOPEN OUR

SCHOOLS WHEN WE'RE ALL AWARE OF

02:24:15.546 --> 02:24:18.316
THE GOVERNOR'S ABILITY TO SOLVE

02:24:18.383 --> 02:24:21.486
IT. WITH A PENCIL DRUG. AND

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:23.221

PARENTS ARE TELLING US THAT

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.601
THIS IS GOING TO GO ON ONCE WE

STILL GOING TO BE DEPRESSED

02:29:13.711 --> 02:29:16.247
KIDS THAT NEEDS HELP SO WE NEED

02:29:16.314 --> 02:29:18.249

HAVE BEEN DOING THIS AS WELL

02:30:18.175 --> 02:30:20.211
AND THERE IS ZERO CASES SO WHEN

THIS POINT AND NOW THE SCIENCE

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:30.254
DOESN'T MATTER WILL BE LOOK AT

02:30:30.321 --> 02:30:31.489
HOW THESE SCHOOLS HAVE ACTUALLY

02:30:31.555 --> 02:30:33.391

DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT.

02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:09.093
THE IMPORTANCE OUR SCHOOLS PLAY

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.128
IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN OUR

02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:12.096
CHILDREN'S LIVES AND OUR FAMILY

02:31:12.163 --> 02:31:14.098
LIVES. IN BEHIND THOSE SCHOOLS

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:16.634
THE EMPLOYEES THAT PLACE AND IN

02:31:16.700 --> 02:31:17.668
SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE

02:31:17.735 --> 02:31:19.303
RESPECT THAT THEY DESERVE NOT

02:31:19.370 --> 02:31:21.439
JUST IN THIS MOMENT. BUT ADDED

02:31:21.505 --> 02:31:23.607
ON TIME AND I THINK AT TIMES WE

02:31:23.674 --> 02:31:24.141
FORGET THAT HERE I IN THE

02:31:24.208 --> 02:31:26.377
LEGISLATURE. EYES ON I THINK

02:31:26.444 --> 02:31:28.379
THAT DURING THIS PROCESS WE ASK

02:31:28.446 --> 02:31:29.046
TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED

02:31:29.113 --> 02:31:31.615
EMPLOYEES TO ADJUST TO ADJUST

02:31:31.682 --> 02:31:33.317
TO REMOTE LEARNING. AND THEY

02:31:33.384 --> 02:31:34.885
DID AND IT'S BEEN HARD FOR THEM

02:31:34.952 --> 02:31:36.353
TO JUST LIKE FOR A FAMILIES WE

02:31:36.420 --> 02:31:37.755
ASK THEM TO JUST A HYBRID

02:31:37.822 --> 02:31:39.256
LEARNING. AND THEY'RE DOING IT

02:31:39.323 --> 02:31:41.091
AND IT'S HARD. WE'RE ASKING

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:42.793
THEM TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:44.462
AND AS A FORMER MATH TEACHER

02:31:44.528 --> 02:31:45.930
FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WE KNOW THAT

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:46.497
THAT'S THE PLACE WE NEED OUR

02:31:46.564 --> 02:31:48.999
KIDS TO BE. BUT WERE AFRAID

02:31:49.066 --> 02:31:51.035
BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING TO PUT

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:52.870
OUR OWN LIFE AT RISK AND TO PUT

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:55.406
OUR FAMILIES LEFT AS RISK. I'VE

02:31:55.473 --> 02:31:56.440
BEEN TALKING TO MY SCHOOL

02:31:56.507 --> 02:31:57.541
DISTRICTS I'VE BEEN TALKING TO

02:31:57.608 --> 02:31:59.743
MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS. AND SO I

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:01.312
THE FAMILIES- FADE TO SEND

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:01.879
THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE

02:32:01.946 --> 02:32:03.147
I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE GOING

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:04.181
TO BE OKAY THEY'RE NOT SURE

02:32:04.248 --> 02:32:05.015
THAT THOSE KIDS ARE GOING TO

02:32:05.082 --> 02:32:06.884
STAY SAFE OR THEY'RE GOING TO

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:07.518
BRING SOMETHING HOME TO THEIR

02:32:07.585 --> 02:32:09.420
FAMILY TO. SPREAD THE DISEASE

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:11.388
AT HOME. NOT NOT ALL MY SCHOOL

02:32:11.455 --> 02:32:12.723
DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE

02:32:12.790 --> 02:32:14.458
TO RE OPEN I HAVE A RATE OF

02:32:14.525 --> 02:32:16.794
INFECTION OF ONE IN. OF A DEATH

02:32:16.861 --> 02:32:18.596
RATE OF ONE IN TWO HUNDRED AND

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:19.797
FIFTY AND HAVE A VACCINATION

02:32:19.864 --> 02:32:25.169
ABOUT ONE IN. TWENTY IN THE

02:32:25.236 --> 02:32:25.870

02:32:25.936 --> 02:32:26.504
WEDNESDAY NOT LONG. IN THERE TO

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:27.705
SCHOOL. THE SCHOOL THIS. IS NOT

02:32:27.771 --> 02:32:29.073
GONNA BE OPEN IN MY CAN. BUT I

02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:29.673
ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE BIGGEST

02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:32.309
LEARNING. AND THIS WILL BE. AND

02:32:32.376 --> 02:32:33.878
I DO NOT KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING

02:32:33.944 --> 02:32:35.746
TO CATCH UP WITH. BEEN BEHIND

02:32:35.813 --> 02:32:37.147
AND I JUST HAVE NO CLUE HOW WE

02:32:37.214 --> 02:32:38.282
GONNA CATCH UP. IN THIS

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.017
PROCESS. AND SO I'M GOING TO

02:32:40.084 --> 02:32:41.485
VOTE I FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:42.486
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:44.555
STEP. BUT IT'S NOT A STEP THAT

02:32:44.622 --> 02:32:45.689
I'M SURE IS GOING TO HELP MY

02:32:45.756 --> 02:32:47.291
COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY FIND THIS

02:32:47.358 --> 02:32:48.459
THAT I'M SURE IS GOING TO HELP

02:32:48.526 --> 02:32:49.860
MY MOST WINNABLE. COMMUNITY

02:32:49.927 --> 02:32:51.529
MEMBERS. AND SO AS THE WORK

02:32:51.595 --> 02:32:53.764
CONTINUES I HOPE THAT THIS HAS

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:54.965
TO BE BROUGHT TO THE TO THIS

IN COMMUNITIES POOR COMMUNITIES

FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO

LACK THE RESOURCES TO CLOSE

SCHOOLS TO COME BACK. WHAT I

DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE IS THE

02:35:20.244 --> 02:35:21.712
CIRCUS PARKING LIKE COMMENTS

02:35:21.779 --> 02:35:23.914
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THOSE

02:35:23.981 --> 02:35:26.083
WHO REPRESENT. SUBURB AREAS OF

02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:28.285
CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE NOT SEEN

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:31.355
THE SAME IMPACT. OF THIS VIRUS

02:35:31.422 --> 02:35:34.725
AFFECTING THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:35:34.792 --> 02:35:35.325
IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THE FACT

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:38.562
OF THE MATTER IS THAT IF YOU

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:40.698
REPRESENT A COMMUNITY THAT'S

02:35:40.764 --> 02:35:42.633
POOR AND ONE THAT IS A COVER.

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:44.635
FAMILIES ARE NOT FEELING

02:35:44.702 --> 02:35:46.603
COMFORTABLE. SENDING THEIR

02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:47.438
CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:54.144
SCHOOLS ARE NOT COMFORTABLE

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:57.114
SENDING FACTORS. THAT GOING

02:35:57.181 --> 02:35:57.614
BACK TO WORK AND HAVING

02:35:57.681 --> 02:35:59.817
CHILDREN THERE. THE FACT IS

02:35:59.883 --> 02:36:01.785
THAT YOU KNOW IN DECEMBER AND

02:36:01.852 --> 02:36:04.188
IN JANUARY WE HAD NO VACCINES.

02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:06.390
TO SEND PEOPLE BACK TO SCHOOLS

02:36:06.457 --> 02:36:08.892
IN A SAFE. ENVIRONMENTALIST E.

02:36:08.959 --> 02:36:10.427
REAL RIGHT AND AGAIN YOU KNOW

02:36:10.494 --> 02:36:11.929
THE CIRCUS BARKING LIKE

02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:14.865
COMMENTS HERE GOT A STOP.

02:36:14.932 --> 02:36:16.233
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A REALITY

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.569
THAT MANY OF US HERE FACE IN

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:21.138
OUR DISTRICTS. THE FACT IS THAT

02:36:21.205 --> 02:36:23.874
THIS IS A STEP. IN MAKING SURE

02:36:23.941 --> 02:36:24.908
THAT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR

02:36:24.975 --> 02:36:26.844
STUDENTS GO BACK SAFELY AND I

02:36:26.910 --> 02:36:28.746
YOU KNOW I'M A PARENT. OF TWO

02:36:28.812 --> 02:36:30.948
TEENAGERS SENIORS. AND THE

02:36:31.014 --> 02:36:32.750
TRADE OFF HERE IS THAT- SENDING

02:36:32.816 --> 02:36:34.118
THEM BACK TO SCHOOL FOR A

02:36:34.184 --> 02:36:37.020
GRADUATION CEREMONY. OR THEIR

02:36:37.087 --> 02:36:41.625
LIVES. THEIR LIVES WAY BEFORE A

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:43.627
GRADUATION CEREMONY. KERN OF A

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:44.828
SIX YEAR OLD WHO BY THE WAY

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:45.929
TESTED POSITIVE ALONG WITH

02:36:45.996 --> 02:36:47.798
MYSELF MY WIFE AND OUR TWO

02:36:47.865 --> 02:36:49.466
TEENAGERS. THE BIGGEST FEAR

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:52.736
THAT I EVER HAD CAME TO REALITY.

02:36:52.803 --> 02:36:54.538
THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS WOULD GET

02:36:54.605 --> 02:36:56.874
SICK AND LUCKILY THANK GOD NONE

02:36:56.940 --> 02:36:58.742
OF THEM ENDED UP IN THE

02:36:58.809 --> 02:37:01.845
HOSPITAL BY THEMSELVES. AND SO

02:37:01.912 --> 02:37:03.147
THE FACT IS THAT THAT'S THE

02:37:03.213 --> 02:37:04.948
COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:05.883
AND WE LIVE IN AND SO WE TALK

02:37:05.949 --> 02:37:07.117
ABOUT WE SHOULD OPEN OUR

02:37:07.184 --> 02:37:08.819

02:37:11.522 --> 02:37:13.290
DIFFERENT REALITY THAN THE ONE

02:37:19.263 --> 02:37:21.698
ALTHOUGH NOT PERFECT. IT IS THE

02:37:21.765 --> 02:37:23.167
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:24.468
MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS OPEN

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:26.837
UP SAFELY. AND THAT IT'S THE

02:37:26.904 --> 02:37:28.906

COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:40.818

02:39:57.454 --> 02:39:59.623
IS A DIFFICULT RESPONSIBILITY

02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:02.726
THERE WE ALL HELD. WE ALL HILL

02:40:02.793 --> 02:40:04.761
SINCE THIS PANDEMIC STARTED.

02:40:04.828 --> 02:40:08.298
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOLS

02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:10.968
HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO

02:40:11.034 --> 02:40:13.337
GO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM

02:40:13.403 --> 02:40:15.572
PHYSICALLY. THIS IS ABOUT THE

02:40:15.639 --> 02:40:19.476
STUDENTS. THEIR FAMILIES

02:40:19.543 --> 02:40:21.011
STUDENTS ACROSS MY DISTRICTS

02:40:21.078 --> 02:40:24.114
ARE STRUGGLING. TO KEEP UP

02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:26.316
ACADEMICALLY AND WILL CONTINUE

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:28.852
TO STRUGGLE IF THEY DO NOT

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:30.821
RECEIVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED.

02:40:30.887 --> 02:40:33.457
THE LEARNING LOS. FOR

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:37.361
COMMUNITIES THAT EVEN DEALING

02:40:37.427 --> 02:40:39.162
WITH THIS PANDEMIC ARE

02:40:39.229 --> 02:40:42.432
STRUGGLING EVEN MORE. THERE

02:40:42.499 --> 02:40:45.602
BEEN DEVASTATED. WE NEED TO

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:49.639
SUPPORT THE YOUNG BRIGHT MINDS.

02:40:49.706 --> 02:40:50.207
THAT COULD ONE DAY STAND ON

02:40:50.273 --> 02:40:52.676
THIS FLOOR. ONE DAY BE THE

02:40:52.743 --> 02:40:55.212
LEADERS AND BE THE CHANGE

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:58.015
AGENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IT

02:40:58.081 --> 02:40:59.516
IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOT TO

02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:03.920
KNOW. THAT MY DISTRICT HAS SOME

02:41:03.987 --> 02:41:04.721
COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS WORKING

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:06.790
EXTREMELY HARD. THOSE ARE THE

02:41:06.857 --> 02:41:09.059
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WHO STEPPED UP

02:41:09.126 --> 02:41:11.361
TIME AND TIME AGAIN. TO

02:41:11.428 --> 02:41:13.797
OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES AND

02:41:13.864 --> 02:41:17.034
THESE OBSTACLES. BROUGHT ON BY

02:41:17.100 --> 02:41:20.003
THIS PANDEMIC MANYOF THEM HAVE

02:41:20.070 --> 02:41:23.306
PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. BUT

02:41:23.373 --> 02:41:25.142
THEY DID A FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

02:41:25.208 --> 02:41:27.244
THEIR COMMUNITY. TEACHERS

02:41:27.310 --> 02:41:29.846
CONTINUE TO DO THEIR BEST DAY

02:41:29.913 --> 02:41:31.681
IN AND DAY OUT TO SUPPORT THEIR

02:41:31.748 --> 02:41:33.216
STUDENTS. UNDER THE

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:36.820
CIRCUMSTANCES THIS PANDEMIC HAS

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:40.724
EXPOSED THE INEQUALITIES THAT

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:42.893
HAVE PREVAILED FOR GENERATIONS.

02:41:42.959 --> 02:41:45.328
AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO LET

02:41:45.395 --> 02:41:47.664
OUR CHILDREN FALL FURTHER

02:41:47.731 --> 02:41:50.734
BEHIND. COMMUNITIES THAT I

02:41:50.801 --> 02:41:52.969
REPRESENT DESERVE A WORKABLE

02:41:53.036 --> 02:41:57.941
PLAN TO MOVE US ALL FORWARD. WE

02:41:58.008 --> 02:42:00.277
HAVE WORKED FOR LESS FOR FAR

02:42:00.343 --> 02:42:02.512
TOO LONG NOW IS THE TIME TO

02:42:02.579 --> 02:42:05.782
SHOW OUR STUDENTS OUR BABIES

02:42:05.849 --> 02:42:07.551
OUR CHILDREN THAT THEY ARE

02:42:07.617 --> 02:42:09.486
WORTH THE INVESTMENT I

02:42:09.553 --> 02:42:11.354
RESPECTFULLY ASK WAS STRONG I

DEBATE THAT WE'VE JUST HAD.

02:42:39.816 --> 02:42:43.553
THIS DISCUSSION. DEMONSTRATES

02:42:43.620 --> 02:42:46.256
WHY EDUCATION IS PROBABLY OUR

02:42:46.323 --> 02:42:49.059
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE. BUT IF

02:42:49.126 --> 02:42:49.559

02:42:49.626 --> 02:42:52.095

VERY STRONG FEELINGS FOR WHAT

WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST THING TO

DO FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND I

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:11.548

02:43:17.554 --> 02:43:18.889
REALLY WHAT'S BEST. FOR OUR

02:43:18.955 --> 02:43:22.792
