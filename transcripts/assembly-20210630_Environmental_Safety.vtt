THIS BILL SB SIX HUNDRED MIGHT

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:18.442
BE IN CONFLICT WITH PROP. TO

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:19.176
EIGHTEEN DO YOU FEEL OF SOME

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:20.911
CONFLICT WITH TWO EIGHT TWO ONE

THAT WE WITH A WILL BUT- BUT

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.132
THE IDEA IS- THIS ALLOWS FOR

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:43.734
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT SO IT'S

00:41:43.801 --> 00:41:44.401
SUSPECTED WHAT'S GOING TO

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:46.804

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.708
WE DID ON TWO THIRTY ONE- I

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.643
CAN'T WROTE YOUR THAT WAS. BUT

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.777
IS QUITE DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.079
LAWYERS WILL DRAFT THIS IN A

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.480
WAY TO AVOID LITIGATION RISK

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.182

STORMWATER AND WHAT DOES THAT

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:02.753
LOOK LIKE IN THE QUESTION IS

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.188
CAN YOU ADD A FEATURE TO IT

00:42:04.255 --> 00:42:05.256
WELL THOSE ARE GOING TO BE

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:08.025
QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE WILL BE-

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.793
NETTED OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.295
LAWYERS WHEN THEY- DRAFT THESE

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:12.496
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS WITH THE

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:13.697
FEE STRUCTURE IS HOW THOSE

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:15.466
CHARGES ARE MADE. THOSE ARE THE

00:42:15.532 --> 00:42:16.667
THINGS THAT CREATE THE

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.769
CHALLENGES IN PROP TO EIGHTEEN

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:19.703
WHICH THE HOWARD JARVIS FOLKS

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.038
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN THEY

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.806
HAD LITIGATION SALINAS VERSUS

00:42:22.873 --> 00:42:24.541

BUT THE POINT IS THAT I DON'T

00:42:28.712 --> 00:42:29.713
THINK IT'LL BE A PROBLEM

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.315

THOUGHT HOW THEY DONE IT WAS

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:24.768
WRONG THIS HUGE OBLIGATION

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:25.903
THINKING COULD BE AS MUCH AS

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.137
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IMPOSE

00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:28.639

VERY I THINK AS- THE SEVEN

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:46.190
ABOUT QUE HAN SAID IS KIND OF

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.192
AN ELEGANT SOLUTION BECAUSE-

00:43:48.258 --> 00:43:50.461
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. THAT THE

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.429
LAW THAT WAS PASSED THE IT IS

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.297
THE BOND ISSUES PASSED IN LOS

YOU HEAD WHY NOT. THAT WATER.

00:44:06.243 --> 00:44:07.811
THAT WERE CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:08.645
THE FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL

00:44:08.712 --> 00:44:09.880
VALLEY WE'RE CAUSING FOR

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:11.281
PROBLEMS WITH WITH WITH LAKE

00:44:11.348 --> 00:44:12.716
MADE AT THE RIVER AND ALL THE

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:14.251
STUFF IS GONE SALTON CITY. WERE

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:15.786
CAUSING PROBLEMS IN THE NORTH.

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:17.521
WE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:18.889
CAPTURE EVERY DROP OF WATER

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:19.923
PARTICULARLY THAT CHALLENGE

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.791
THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.259
DROUGHT. SO WHAT'S GOING TO

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.293
HAPPEN IN THIS MEASURE AS

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.162
OPPOSED TO WHAT HAPPENED. UNDER

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:26.497
THE BOND ISSUE THE THAT YOU'RE

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:28.532
CITIES WERE SO UPSET ABOUT. IS

00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:29.533
THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.136
CAPTURE AND MAKE MONEY RIGHT TO

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:34.338
RECYCLE THAT WATER TO RECHARGE

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:35.305
THE GROUNDWATER WHICH IS SO

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.974
IMPORTANT. METROPOLITAN WATER

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:37.775
IS THE ONLY COUNTY IS

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:38.842
INCREDIBLE MAP WHICH ON THE

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:40.577
DOOR OF MY OFFICE MY DISTRICT

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:41.645
WHICH SHOWS ALL THE PLACES

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:42.613
THROUGHOUT BOTH ORANGE COUNTY

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:43.947
L. A. COUNTY. WELL WE CAN

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.616
RECHARGE THE GROUNDWATER. TO

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.684
ELIMINATE THESE LARGER PROBLEMS

00:44:47.751 --> 00:44:48.952
WE SHOULD RESTRUCTURE WATER

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.220
POLICY IN CALIFORNIA

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:51.922
PARTICULARLY. AT A TIME WHEN

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:52.956
WE'RE FACING SUCH AN EXTRA

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.825
NEGATIVELY WHAT FACING THE DROP

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:56.727
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS. SO

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.629
THIS DID THIS IS A THIS IS A

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.697
STORY CORK IN THE LAW WHERE.

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.232
WE'VE GOT THESE STUPID SILOS

00:45:02.299 --> 00:45:03.434
ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE OF

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.135
HISTORICAL REASONS. AND WHAT

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.470
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO BE

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.238
CREATIVE COMING UP WITH WAYS.

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:10.140
WHERE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.708
WORK TOGETHER SAY WATER AND

00:45:11.775 --> 00:45:14.445
ALSO POSSIBLY TAKE THAT WATER.

00:45:14.511 --> 00:45:15.979
THAT RIGHT NOW YOUR CITY HAS TO

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.981
PAY TO PUT THE OCEAN MAYBE THEY

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:19.550
COULD TURN INTO AN ASSET. THEY

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:20.918
DON'T HAVE TO BUY WATER AT

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.986
ELEVEN DOLLARS AN ACRE FOOT.

00:45:23.053 --> 00:45:24.021
THAT'S THE REASON SO IT'S A

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:25.189
REALLY IT'S TO ME IT'S

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:26.090
COMPLIMENTARY IT SHOULD BE

00:45:26.156 --> 00:45:27.825
SUPPORTIVE OF. BUT YOUR POINT

00:45:27.891 --> 00:45:28.992
IS BRILLIANTLY TAKEN AND I

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:29.860
AGREE WITH YOU AND I DIDN'T

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:31.562
SUPPORT THAT WATER BOND THE

00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.330
TIME. PRECISELY FOR THAT REASON

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.698
IS WE SHOULDN'T JUST SAY WE'RE

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:35.866
GONNA CLEAN UP THE WATER WE

00:45:35.933 --> 00:45:37.267
SHOULD CLEAN IT UP AND CAPTURED

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:38.235
BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN UP TO

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:42.806
FEDERAL STANDARDS. FROM WHICH

00:45:42.873 --> 00:45:43.440
WE CAN THEN HAVE. PIPES BUILT A

00:45:43.507 --> 00:45:43.974
RECHARGE GROUNDWATER WHICH

00:45:44.041 --> 00:45:45.008
WOULD BE TELE POLICY WHICH IS

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.243
ULTIMATELY WHAT I WANT TO GO IN
