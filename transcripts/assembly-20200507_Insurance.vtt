DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.222
THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:46.722
THE CURRENT RATE MAKING

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:48.724
PROCESS. TO THE CONTRARY THE

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:49.625
DEPARTMENT BELIEVES THAT THE

01:08:49.692 --> 01:08:51.293
CURRENT RATE MAKING PROCESS

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:52.962
PRESCRIBED UNDER PROPOSITION

ONE OF THREE. IS AVAILABLE FOR

RATE TODAY. INDEED INSURANCE

COMMIT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.072
SUBMITTED RATE APPLICATIONS IN

UNPRECEDENTED. NUMBERS THESE

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:08.544
PAST FEW YEARS. AND WHEN I AM

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:10.679
SURE CAN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:11.180
THAT A FILE GREAT IS NOT

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.682
EXCESSIVE. INADEQUATE FOR IN

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:15.684
FAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY THE

01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.752
DEPARTMENT HAS ACTUALLY HAS

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.854
APPROVED THAT INCREASE IN FACT

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.689
THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROVED TWO

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.358
HUNDRED AND TEN. HOMEOWNERS

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.660

SIXTEEN THROUGH TWENTY NINETEEN.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.596
THAT MEANS MANY INSURERS HAVE

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.598
ALREADY BEEN RECEIVING MULTIPLE

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.734
RATE INCREASES WHICH WE BELIEVE

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.003
IS A DIRECT CONTRAST SUGGESTION

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:34.803
MADE BY SOME IN THE INSURANCE

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.272
INDUSTRY THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:09:36.338 --> 01:09:37.773
HAS NOT ADEQUATELY APPROVING

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.643
BREAK REQUEST MADE BY INSURERS.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.044
AND AN ASSERTION AND COMMITTEES

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.046
ANALYSIS THAT RATES ARE

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.681
ADEQUATE ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:47.216
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS ALREADY

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.118
MAINTENANCE DOUBLE DIGIT. AND

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:51.186
EVEN TRIPLE DIGIT INCREASES FOR

01:09:51.253 --> 01:09:52.288
MANY POLICY HOLDERS ACROSS THE

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.357
STATE ESPECIALLY IN HIGH RISK

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:57.526
LOCATIONS AND WHAT WE- AND YET

01:09:57.593 --> 01:09:59.361
THAT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:01.096
BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD. CREATE

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.932
A FAST TRACK AROUND THE CURRENT

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.934

COMMISSIONER FOR RATE

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.448

THE RISK IN THOSE AREAS IT'S

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.505
THAT'S THE MARKET ASSISTANCE

WRISTS AS A CITY OR IS A COUNTY

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:28.276
IT WILL SHED LIGHT ON THOSE

THROUGH THE LENS OF THIS STUDY.

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:50.365
AND THEN- DECIDE THAT THEY'RE

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.634
WILLING TO COME IN IT KICKS IN

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:53.101
WHEN THERE IS A MARKET

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:55.537
DISLOCATION. OF SO IT'S

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.205
APPROPRIATE THAT WAY IT IS A

01:17:57.272 --> 01:18:00.342
NEW TOOL IN THE TOOL KIT TO A

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:02.244
DOLLARS OF THESE RISKS. ARE

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:04.613
DIFFERENT AND COMBINE. ARTIST

SCALE NOT PREVIOUSLY SEEN AND

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.717
WILL ASSIST THE INSURANCE

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:13.121
MARKET PLACE TO RESPOND OF. AND

01:18:13.188 --> 01:18:14.790
THIS IS WHY I WATCH YOU WANT TO

01:18:14.856 --> 01:18:16.358
POINT OUT HAT THIS BILL

01:18:16.425 --> 01:18:18.927
PROVIDES THAT IT OUGHT TO BE

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.329
ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED AS A IN

SENATE BILL WE WILL ALSO SEE

01:18:25.434 --> 01:18:27.836
TODAY. AND IT FOR THESE REASONS

01:18:27.903 --> 01:18:29.237
THE PROVISIONS ARE ACTUALLY NOT

01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:32.908
SEPARABLE. THAT THE TWO BILLS

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:34.943
THEIR PROVISIONS REPRESENTS A-

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.912
AN INTEGRATED PACKAGE ON HOW TO

01:18:36.978 --> 01:18:38.413
STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA CHURCH

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.582
MARKET PLACE AND I DO WANT TO

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:41.983
POINT OUT THAT JUST AS WHEN

CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.056
AND SET UP THEIR SYSTEM OF RATE

01:18:48.123 --> 01:18:51.660
SETTING IT CONCLUDES WITH ALL

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:52.727

COMMERCIAL PROPERTY USE. THIS

01:18:55.797 --> 01:18:56.498
BILL IS NOT AN END RUN AROUND

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.233
COMMERCIAL RATE APPROVAL THAT

IS ALSO INCORPORATED IN THIS.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.704
AND TO THE OBJECTION THAT WELL

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.806
WE MIGHT HAVE TO RUSH. ALL THE

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.142
FIRST COMMERCIAL WILL BE ABLE

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:09.311

RATE THAT COMES INTO THIS PLAN

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:16.618
WILL NOT BE A CASE OF FIRST

01:19:16.685 --> 01:19:19.254
IMPRESSION I GOTTA FIGURE OUT

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.289
ALL THOSE BURIED IN THIS THING.

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:22.557
IT'LL BE FOUNDED UPON THIS

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:24.526
PUBLIC TOOLS SO I ACTUALLY FEEL

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.128

THAT- AND HOW- HOW WOULD AFFECT

ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THERE'S NO.

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:08.063
THERE SHOULD BE NO THE FACT. SO

01:21:08.129 --> 01:21:10.098
THERE'S THEY SHOULD NOT SEE THE

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:11.933
NECESSARILY SEE AN INCREASE IN

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.836
THEIR POLICY. THEN THE PREMIUMS

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.371
WITH THIS WITH THIS SOMEPLACE

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.240
IS OUT OF I DON'T ABOUT THE

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:20.375
BEEN DISSIPATED THIS BILL. THAT

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:24.212
THIS NEW- A PROCEDURE- THIS NEW

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:30.385
PLANNING DEVICE. WOULD. WOULD

01:21:30.452 --> 01:21:33.588
WE WOULD BEAR THAT RESULT IF IT

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:38.360
IT'S DESIGNED TO. TO MAKE THE

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:41.696
MARKET MECHANISMS IN COUNTIES

01:21:41.763 --> 01:21:43.765
IN REGIONS MORE VIBRANT FOR

01:21:43.832 --> 01:21:45.867
THOSE INSURERS WHO WHO CHOOSE

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:49.571
NOT NOT TO OFFER INSURANCE.

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.506
SOMETIMES THIS WILL GIVE THEM.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:56.278
A PATH TO DO SO. AND THAT OF MY

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.413
FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE HOW DO

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.249
WE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:04.386
WILL ACTUALLY STIMULATE- THE

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.187
ABILITY FOR VENTURES ACTUALLY

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.956
WRITE POLICIES IN THESE AREAS

01:22:08.023 --> 01:22:10.158
THAT'S THE GOAL MISTER WOOD IS-

01:22:10.225 --> 01:22:12.894
AND BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE IS A-

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:15.096
A BIT OF A CRISIS IN CERTAIN.

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:18.033
HIGH FIRE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.701
WHERE INSURERS HAVE PULLED BACK

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:24.506
FROM THE MARKET PLACE- AND THIS

01:22:24.572 --> 01:22:28.343
IS DESIGNED TO BE I DON'T WANT

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.478
TO. YOU KNOW THE PHRASE CARROT

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:32.113
AND STICK IS OVER USE BUT

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.649
THERE'S AN INCENTIVE HERE- FOR

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:36.084
INSURERS TO HAVE A CERTAIN

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:38.386
AMOUNT OF CERTAINTY- THE

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.455
COMMUNITY. INDIVIDUAL

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:41.890
HOMEOWNERS AND THE COMMUNITIES

BELIEVE THAT WILL. I DON'T KNOW

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.505
HILL DRIVE DOWN COSTS BUT IT'LL

01:22:57.572 --> 01:22:59.140
IT'LL GIVE SOME ASSURANCE ON

01:22:59.207 --> 01:23:01.443
COSTS. AND THE WHOLE GOAL HERE

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:03.011
IS TO GET INSURERS WHO WERE NOT

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:05.246
WRITING. ENOUGH POLICIES

01:23:05.313 --> 01:23:07.148
ENOUGH. POLICIES WE WOULD

01:23:07.215 --> 01:23:11.052

ON MY BILL. SECONDLY I THINK

02:27:45.823 --> 02:27:47.458
IT'S NOTEWORTHY THAT THE FIRE

02:27:47.525 --> 02:27:48.993
DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF

OF THE COUNTY. AND YET SOMEHOW.

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:20.484
IT DOESN'T QUALIFY HERE. FOR

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:23.287
THIS SO- I DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:34:23.354 --> 02:34:24.288

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:25.589
OTHER COUNT AS A REPRESENT DO

02:34:25.656 --> 02:34:28.759
BUT- BUT- I'M YOU KNOW I'M I

02:34:48.178 --> 02:34:49.480
FRANKLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

02:34:49.546 --> 02:34:51.281
WHEN THAT FREEZE COMES OFF AND

02:34:51.348 --> 02:34:52.449
I MY INSTINCT IS THAT THOSE

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:54.318
RATES ARE GOING TO GO OUT AND

02:34:54.385 --> 02:34:56.120
THAT THAT CONCERNS ME THAT

02:34:56.186 --> 02:34:57.588
CONCERNS ME AS WELL SOME OF THE

02:34:57.655 --> 02:35:00.391
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY- BUT I'M

02:35:00.457 --> 02:35:02.926
IN A RESERVE THE RIGHT TO- NOT

RECONSIDER THAT ON THE FLOOR I

02:35:14.271 --> 02:35:16.340
AM STILL CONCERNED THAT THIS

02:35:16.407 --> 02:35:19.343
COULD LEAD TO A SPIKE IN AND

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:22.746
RATES- THAT THAT WOULD MAKE IT-

02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:25.115
YOU KNOW I FIND ACCEPTABLE FOR

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:28.285
A LOT OF PEOPLE. SO DO YOU HAVE

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:30.054
ANY INSTINCT ORDERS MY

02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:31.889
INSTINCT- THE ONLY ONE DO YOU

02:35:31.955 --> 02:35:32.823
HAVE ANY ANSWERING TO WHAT'S

02:35:32.890 --> 02:35:34.692
GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN THAT THAT

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:37.728
RATE FREEZE AB COME HAPPENS.

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:40.130
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION OF

02:35:40.197 --> 02:35:40.764
COURSE YOU KNOW YOUR AREA

02:35:40.831 --> 02:35:43.400
DESERVES AS MUCH CARE AS IT SB

02:35:43.467 --> 02:35:44.835
ENTIRE CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S A

02:35:44.902 --> 02:35:45.969
SPECIFIC REASON WHY THAT

02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:48.238
HAPPENED AND I HAVE ONE OF MY

02:35:48.305 --> 02:35:49.506
STAFF MEMBERS THAT WE CAN

02:35:49.573 --> 02:35:50.641
DEFERRED TO HAND YOU CAN

02:35:50.708 --> 02:35:52.876
EXPLAIN WHY YOU'RE COUNTY WITH

02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:54.378
LEFT OUT AND I HAVE TO DO WITH

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:55.045
THE PREVIOUS BILL AND STILL

02:35:55.112 --> 02:36:00.918
TRYING TO PIECE ON. A LATE. MR

02:36:00.984 --> 02:36:03.020
SOME MEMBER IN RESPONSE TO YOUR-

02:36:03.087 --> 02:36:04.722
IT IS QUITE SURPRISING-

02:36:04.788 --> 02:36:07.157
INITIALLY THAT. THE COUNTY OF

02:36:07.224 --> 02:36:08.258
SADDAM WOULD BE OFF THE LIST

02:36:08.325 --> 02:36:10.227
BUT IT IS I BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:36:10.294 --> 02:36:11.929
IS FOR KIND O ONE MAIN REASON.

02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:14.164
THAT IS THAT SB EIGHT TWENTY

02:36:14.231 --> 02:36:16.500
FOUR PROVIDES PROTECTION. FOR

02:36:16.567 --> 02:36:17.901
ZIP CODES THAT WERE A STATE OF

02:36:17.968 --> 02:36:20.637
EMERGENCY SO. FOR THE LAST-

02:36:20.704 --> 02:36:22.339
SOCIALLY FOR YEARS I'VE BEEN TO

02:36:22.406 --> 02:36:23.741
DEVASTATING FIRES THAT HAVE

02:36:23.807 --> 02:36:26.610
ALLOWED- THE PEOPLE IN CINEMA

02:36:26.677 --> 02:36:28.145
TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE WHEREAS

02:36:28.212 --> 02:36:29.646
OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE. OF

02:36:29.713 --> 02:36:31.281
THE DO NOT HAVE THIS PROTECTION

02:36:31.348 --> 02:36:32.783
HAVE BEEN NON RENEWED. AND I'VE

02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:34.685
GONE INTO THE FAIR PLAN. SO I

02:36:34.752 --> 02:36:36.120
BELIEVE THAT IN THE FUTURE THAT

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:37.921
IF THOSE PROTECTIONS EXPIRE.

02:36:37.988 --> 02:36:41.658
THAT INSURERS WILL AGAIN.

02:36:41.725 --> 02:36:42.426
COMMIT TO DO MORE LAW WE WILL

02:36:42.493 --> 02:36:44.161
IN YOUR AREA AND OTHER AREAS.

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:46.597
AND ASK THOSE HOMEOWNERS- RELY

02:36:46.663 --> 02:36:47.831
ON FAIR PLAN FOR THEIR

02:36:47.898 --> 02:36:50.601
INSURANCE- THE SYSTEM SET UP

02:36:50.667 --> 02:36:52.836
WILL CAPTURE THAT INFORMATION.

02:36:52.903 --> 02:36:56.240
AND QUALIFY THE COUNTY- WHEN IT

02:36:56.306 --> 02:36:56.907
REACHES EXCUSE ME THE THRESHOLD.

02:36:56.974 --> 02:37:01.445
THANK YOU. SO IF I UNDERSTAND

02:37:01.512 --> 02:37:03.614
IT IT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

02:37:03.680 --> 02:37:05.182
ONCE WAS PROTECTIONS GO WAY

02:37:05.249 --> 02:37:07.017
THAT MY COUNTY WILL NOW BE

02:37:07.084 --> 02:37:08.619
ELIGIBLE UNDER THIS IS AT THAT

02:37:08.685 --> 02:37:11.655
FAIR. THE CURRENT PROTECTIONS

02:37:11.722 --> 02:37:13.157
BASED ON ZIP CODES THAT WHICH

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:17.294
IS THAT SUCH A WHAT YOU'VE SAID.

02:37:17.361 --> 02:37:18.061
OKAY YEAH THE CURRENT

02:37:18.128 --> 02:37:20.130
PROTECTIONS BASED ON ZIP CODE.

02:37:20.197 --> 02:37:23.867
ROLL ALLOW LOOKS IN ON THE

02:37:23.934 --> 02:37:26.537
COUNTY TO NOT DEAL WITH AS MANY

02:37:26.603 --> 02:37:28.705
ON RULES BECAUSE OF THE FACT

02:37:28.772 --> 02:37:30.240
THAT THE INSURERS ARE NOT

02:37:30.307 --> 02:37:31.241
ALLOWED TO NON RENEW THEIR

02:37:31.308 --> 02:37:33.811
HOMEOWNER'S BUT IT'S PRETTY

02:37:33.877 --> 02:37:36.046
WELL CORRELATED THAT WOULD NOT

02:37:36.113 --> 02:37:37.181
RULES EXCEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT

02:37:37.247 --> 02:37:39.016
OF THEIR PLAN WILL HAVE A

02:37:39.082 --> 02:37:41.185
SEARCH- IN THAT AREA BECAUSE

02:37:41.251 --> 02:37:42.820
THE OTHER INSURERS ARE AT THEIR

02:37:42.886 --> 02:37:44.321
CONCENTRATION OF THAT AND NOT

02:37:44.388 --> 02:37:47.224
ABLE TO WRITE A MORE POLICY

02:37:47.291 --> 02:37:48.258
THIS TYPE OF MARKET CONTRACTION

02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:50.928
LOCALLY IS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS

02:37:50.994 --> 02:37:53.130
DESIGNED TO MONITOR AND-

02:37:53.197 --> 02:37:56.366
EVALUATE IN REAL TIME- ON AN ON

02:37:56.433 --> 02:37:59.303
AN ONGOING BASIS IN ORDER TO-

02:37:59.369 --> 02:38:02.472
PROVIDE- YOU KNOW OVER THE NEXT

02:38:02.539 --> 02:38:04.608
FEW YEARS THERE WILL BE SEVERAL

02:38:04.675 --> 02:38:05.342
DIFFERENT COUNTIES THAT WOULD

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:07.211
NOT BE ELIGIBLE NOW. THAT WOULD

02:38:07.277 --> 02:38:08.378
BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND I AM NOT

02:38:08.445 --> 02:38:10.380
PROGRAM YOU ASSUMING THAT THERE

02:38:10.447 --> 02:38:13.984
ARE MORE DEVASTATING WILDFIRES

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:14.985
AND MORE NOT RULES. OKAY THAT

02:38:15.052 --> 02:38:15.986
WAS THE FIRST WAS WITH THE

02:38:16.053 --> 02:38:17.354
SECOND QUESTION WAS THE MILLION

02:38:17.421 --> 02:38:18.789
HOMES THAT HAVE HAD THEIR RATES

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:21.225
FROZEN. WHAT WE EXPECT WHEN

02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:24.127
THAT WENT UP WHEN THAT FREEZE

02:38:24.194 --> 02:38:24.761
ENDS WHICH I BELIEVE WILL

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:26.730
HAPPEN LATER THIS YEAR. IF I'M

02:38:26.797 --> 02:38:27.364
NOT CORRECT I'M NOT SURE WHEN

02:38:27.431 --> 02:38:29.099
IT'S GOING TO END. BUT I GUESS

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:30.200
THAT'S UP TO THE INSURANCE

02:38:30.267 --> 02:38:32.302
COMMISSIONER- WHEN THAT HAPPENS

02:38:32.369 --> 02:38:33.904
BUT- I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK

02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:36.006
THAT THE RATES ARE GOING TO GO

02:38:36.073 --> 02:38:36.974
OUT. WHEN THAT HAPPENS SO. AND

02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:38.775
IT'S A VALID CONCERN AND AS I

02:38:38.842 --> 02:38:40.143
MENTIONED AGAIN THE INSURANCE

02:38:40.210 --> 02:38:42.246
COMMISSIONER A IS GOING TO BE

02:38:42.312 --> 02:38:42.880
PART OF THIS PROCESS EVERY STEP

02:38:42.946 --> 02:38:44.448
OF THE WAY. SO THERE IS

02:38:44.514 --> 02:38:45.949
PROTECTION IN THAT RESPECT AND

02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:47.985
AS BRIAN MENTIONED OP. I TO

02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:49.586

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:50.921
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE THAT

02:38:50.988 --> 02:38:53.957
PROTECTION- WITH WHAT ANY BE.

02:38:54.024 --> 02:38:54.992
IT WASN'T INCLUDED BUT ONCE

02:38:55.058 --> 02:38:57.060
IT'S UP. THIRTY BASED ON THE

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:58.762
NON RENEWAL AND A FAIR CAN

02:38:58.829 --> 02:39:03.033
SEARCH. IT WILL TRIGGER. THE

02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:03.600
AYE MAP PROTECTION FOR YOUR

02:39:03.667 --> 02:39:09.339
COMMUNITY. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:39:09.406 --> 02:39:11.174
QUESTION THE ELIGIBILITY OF A

02:39:11.241 --> 02:39:13.810
COUNTY. AND IT APPEARS THAT

02:39:13.877 --> 02:39:15.479
THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN

02:39:15.545 --> 02:39:17.915
LINE NOW OF THE TO. THAT ARE IN

02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:20.617
EFFECT BUT IN THE SEQUENCE OF

02:39:20.684 --> 02:39:23.253
EVENTS THAT. AT THE CINEMA

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.455
COUNTY FOR INSTANCE MAY BE ABLE

02:39:25.522 --> 02:39:28.091
TO PARTICIPATE BUT I FOR ONE

02:39:28.158 --> 02:39:28.692
WILL BE WATCHING THAT I THINK

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:32.095
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT- MATTER.

02:39:32.162 --> 02:39:34.464
AND WE WANT THIS TO WORK

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:36.066
WHEREVER IT'S NEEDED I THINK

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:38.068
THAT'S THE GOAL LET'S KEEP OUR

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:41.071
EYE ON THE BALL THERE AND. I

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:43.173
RESPECT THE SENATE STAFFER IN

FOR HOMEOWNERS IN FIRE RISK

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:53.583
AREAS AT SOME POINT SO THE

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:55.419
ELIGIBILITY BY ANY COUNTY IS A

02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:56.720

THOUGH IS THAT. THE CITIZENS OF

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:07.497
THE COUNTY HAVE ALREADY

02:40:07.564 --> 02:40:09.199
SUFFERED CATASTROPHIC LOSSES

02:40:09.266 --> 02:40:10.801
ONCE THE PROTECTION OF THE ZIP

02:40:12.970 --> 02:40:14.671
