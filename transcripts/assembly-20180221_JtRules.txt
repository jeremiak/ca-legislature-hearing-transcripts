GOOD MORNING. WELCOME TO THIS HEARING OF THE. JOINT COMMITTEE ON RULES OF THE CALIFORNIA SENATE ASSEMBLY. OF THE PERSON DAY'S HEARING IS TO RECEIVE A REPORT. APPARENT FOR US CONCERNING THE STATE CAPITOL AND EX UP PROJECT. AND. I WILL OPEN AND THEN PASS THE OPENING TO MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR ANTHONY CANNELLA THE. VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THEN WE'LL HEAR REPORT FROM ARCHITECTURAL FIRM. AS WE START THIS HEARING AYE AYE DIFFERENT WANT TO. BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING THAT KNOWLEDGE AND THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF GOVERNOR BROWN. WHO WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS SENIOR PERSONNEL AND TWENTY SIXTEEN? INITIATED A CONVERSATION OR WHAT TO DO WITH THIS ANNEX. ARM ITS A PECULIARITY OF MY CAREER THAT AND. TWO MONTHS BEFORE I WAS MARRIED IN JULY OF NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED. A BILL BY FORMER SENATOR WILL SURELY ON RALPH. AB TOOL SEVEN. MOVING THE FUNDS FOR THE WEST WING PROJECT INTO LET'S HAVE ACCOUNTS SELECT YOUR TRIGGER PROCEED. AND OF COURSE TO THIS DAY THE WEST WING IS A BEAUTIFUL STRUCTURE. WE SEE PEOPLE WALKING THROUGH IT. WALKING UP TOWARDS HER TO GAZE AT THIS SYMBOL OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND ENJOYING IT DURING THEIR VISITS ON A DAILY BASIS. AND SO WE COME NOW AT DURING THE GOVERNOR'S SECOND TENURE. WITH THE PROSPECT THAT HE MIGHT BE SIGNED IN THE FUNDING BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING. FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE STATE CAPITOL FACILITY. A CONVERSATION WHICH HE HIMSELF INITIATED WHAT THE SUPPORT OF HIS SENIOR TAME. MARRIED BARBELL BADGER SECTOR GOVERN OPERATIONS. JULIE A DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. MISTER DANIEL KIM DIRECTOR GENERAL SERVICES MARIBEL AND DANIEL CAME IN THEIR SENIOR STAFF MET. OUR STAFF OVER IN THE XEROX BUILDING A IN THE SPRING OF LAST YEAR TO HAVE A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT WHERE WE NEEDED TO GO. WHAT TYPES OF STUDIES WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND THE STUDY WILL HEAR ABOUT TODAY IS AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT CONVERSATION? WITH THE GOVERNOR SENIOR STAFF ALSO JASON KENNEDY WHO'S THE DIRECTOR VICE. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE REAL ESTATE SERVICES DIVISION TGS ACTUALLY IS ACCOMPANIED US ON TRIPS AROUND THE COUNTRY TO LOOK AT SOME STATE CAPITALS. BECAUSE MANY STATES OUR SIR BUT AHEAD OF US ON THIS CURVE OF LOOKING AT OLD. DAVID LET'S SAY FOR SALAS AND UPDATED. SO THERE'S A LOT OF PATHFINDER'S ON THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE LEARN FROM THAT WAS ACTUAR FIRST HEARING LASTSUMMER HEARING FROM SOME IS BEEN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE. PROJECTS AW I'M GLAD TO SEE OUR STATE ARCHITECT CHECK WIDE OF HERE TODAY HE'S BEEN VERY GRACIOUS TO ME. A IN CONVERSATION PROVIDE IN SUPPORT. AND. DOWN THE FINANCIAL SIDE WE'VE HAD ACTOR INVOLVED FOR KEELY BOSS WITH THE CABINET SECRETARY FOR GOVERNOR BROWN. AND OF COURSE MICHAEL COHEN A DIRECTOR OF FINANCE WHO. WAS I BEEN HIS OFFICE MANY A TIME HE'S BEEN IN MY OFFICE HOPING I'LL HELPING ME AND OUR TEAM JUST THINK THROUGH WHAT WE ARE DOING. SO. I THINK THIS PROJECT REPRESENTS AN OPTION FOR US TO DO THREE VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE IS IMPROVING ACCESS TO THE BUILDING. AND. WE KNOW THAT THE BUILDING THE ANNEX WAS BUILT IN FIFTY TWO IT DOES NOT HAVE. SPRINKLERS. BUT ALSO DID THE. EIGHTY A ACCESS IS NOT THERE WE WALK AROUND THE BUILDING THOSE OF US WALK PAST THESE LIFTS ALL THE TIME. NOT REALIZING HELP CONTENT KRISTEN GOOD BE HOW BULKY THEY COULD BE. HOW SOMEONE HAS A A MOTORIZED CHAIR WITH ROOM FOR THEIR CRUTCHES IN THE BACK? THAT THAT THAT MAY ACTUALLY NOT FIT THE LIVES WE PROVIDE. SO THERE'S MANY WAYS IN WHICH THE BUILDING IS NOT WELCOME AND ALL CALIFORNIANS THE SHEEN ON THE FLOOR DOES NOT ADDRESS PEOPLE VISUAL OCULAR IMPAIRMENTS. AND EVEN THE THE HARD SERVICES THE QUARTERS AFFECTED NOISE LEVEL THE CAN AFFECT PEOPLE WITH HEARING ISSUE SO THERE'S. MANY WAYS WE MIGHT IMPROVE IT. AND THIS ACTUALLY WOULD BE IN KEEPING WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF CALIFORNIANS. I. I GREATLY ENJOY THE FACT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE WEST WING AND YOU WALK UP AND DOWN THOSE STAIRCASES. DECORATING THE BOTTOMS OF ALL THE NEWEL POST CARVED IN THE WATER PINEAPPLES. WHICH OUR SYMBOL OF HOSPITALITY BECAUSE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTIES YOU HAD TO COME TO. THE CUT MILIEU ES FROM HAWAII. AND IT'S IT CAUSES ME REFLECTED. WHEN THE BUILDING OPENED IN THE WEST WING. EVERYBODY WHO WENT ANYWHERE IN THE BUILDING USING THOSE STAIRCASES EVERYWHERE THEY TURN THEIR SUPPLYING UPPER REMIND THEM. OF THE WELCOMING MESSAGE OF THE. PEOPLE'S HOUSE. IT IS A MARVEL TO ME THAT THE WEST WING WITH SO MANY GREAT SYMBOLS CONCERNING OUR DEMOCRACY AND WELCOMING PEOPLE. SO RICH WAS SYMBOLISM THAT WE COME IN THE ANNEX AND THE SYMBOLS ARE NOT HERE. SOMEHOW THERE IS A TOTAL FAIL TO CARRY FOR THIS VISION OF HOSPITALITY AND THE USE OF SYMBOLS TO CONVEY THE MEANING OF OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. WHEN YOU GIVE THE ADDICTS ARE JUST NOT THERE. ARE. ALSO WILL JUST THE IDEA OF SUPPORTING GREATER CIVIC ENGAGEMENT I THINK. WHEN I FIRST STARTED THE BUILDING IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHAT THE KIDS HAD TO SEE WAS ACCOUNTING EXHIBITS. THEN MY FIRST BOSS IN CHARGE OF THE WEST WING ADDED THE MUSEUM ROSE WHICH WAS A GREAT LEAP FORWARD. AND NOW YOU GO TO THE GETTY MUSEUM LOS ANGELES HIM OF NATURAL HISTORY OUR OWN GOLDEN STATE MUSEUM. THE TECHNOLOGY OF INTERACTIVE EXHIBITS IS SO MUCH GREATER. AND SO I THINK A BUILDING PROJECTS ALLOWS US TO WEAVE INTO IT. A GREATER EXPERIENCE FOR THOSE WHO WOULD COME TO LEARN WHAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT AND PARTICIPATE. AND THIS SUPPORTS OUR CIVIC ENGAGEMENT GENERALLY. SO. TO CONCLUDE I JUST WANT TO KNOW. HOW WE GOT HERE WAS THAT I AND I THINK A SUPPORT FOR TRANSPARENCY PURPOSES? IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SIXTEEN. SHORTLY AFTER I BECAME. RULES CHAIR WE PREPARED A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SEEKING ARCHITECTURAL FIRMS WITH. PEOPLE'S HOUSE EXPERIENCE. TO SEE IF THERE BE WILLING TO ASSIST US IN A STUDY OF THIS BUILDING. ARE WE HAD. EVENTUALLY SEVEN FIRM SUBMIT. WE WERE USED LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO REDACT ALTHOUGH YOU IDENTIFYING INFORMATION THOSE VARIOUS PROPOSALS. WE USED A MEMBER OF MY STAFF AND MEMBERS SEND ASSEMBLY STAFF. TO REVIEW THOSE PROPOSES USING A SCORING MATRIX. PARA BY AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN CONSTRUCTION. SO WE HAD A LAW FROM THE DESERT SORT THINGS OUR BREAD AND BUTTER. LOOK AT THE ARE OFF I TELL US HOW WE COULD SCORE THESE THINGS CONSIST WITH THE ARAFAT I. TRAIN THE PEOPLE DID IT WE'VE MADE OUR STAFF SIGN NON CONFLICT AGREEMENTS. TO ESTABLISH THAT THAT WAS SORT OF A SQUEAKY CLEAN PROCESS WHEN THEY WERE DONE ALL WE KNEW WAS THAT THEY HAD THE TOP THREE THERE WAS NO RANKING PROVIDED. THERE WERE NOT TELL US WHO THEY THOUGHT WAS THE BEST THEY JUST GIVES THE TOP THREE. AND THEN THE OTHER DAY LAST YEAR US SENATE CANNELLA AND I WOULD MISS GRAVER AND MISTER ALVAREZ. CONVENED PRESENTATIONS WERE THE TOP FIRMS CAME REPRESENTED. SO THE FIRMWARE HEARING FROM TODAY IS THE FIRM THAT WENT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND ROSE TO THE TOP. AND SO YOU SEE THAT REFLECTED IN THEIR WORK. I DO WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE IS AN ANNEX WEBSITE FOR ANYONE WHO MIGHT LOOK HERE. IT'S ANNEX DOT ASSEMBLY DOT CA DOT GOV. ANNEX DOT ASSEMBLY GOT CA DOT GOV AND THEN WE'RE GOING THAT WEBSITE EVEN NOW THIS MORNING IS HEARINGS UNDERWAY WILL FIND LINKS TO EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE REPORT. WE'VE WE'VE KEPT THAT WEBSITE UP THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEAR TO MAKE EVERYWHERE DOING VERY ACCESSIBLE. AND. OBVIOUSLY IT OTHER OBJECT OF THIS. IS AT THE OTHER DAY WE HAVE ALL THOSE FOURTH GRADERS WHO COME HERE THE PUBLIC OF COMES HERE. PEOPLE BE UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS BUILDING WE WANT THIS TO BE A SAFE BUILDING TO VISIT. SO PARENTS WHO WHO SEND THEIR KIDS TO A DELIGHTFUL DAY IN THE CAPITAL HAVE AN ASSURANCE THAT THAT'S WHAT WILL UNFOLD. SO WITH THAT I JUST THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. AND I WOULD TURN OUT TO MY CHAIR CENTER CANNELLA FOR SOME REMARKS THANK YOU SIR CANNELLA CHRISTIANITY. APPRECIATE YOU WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE THE. YOU MENTIONED THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND A AND THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE I THINK WE'RE FORGET THAT WE THINK OF THIS AS AN OFFICE BUILDING THAT WE COME TO EVERY DAY AND. AND ALL THE HONEST. I GET CONFUSED NAVIGATING THIS BUILDING OCCASIONALLY HAVE BEEN HERE THIS MY EIGHT YEAR SO I CAN IMAGINE BEING A FOURTH GRADER IN A TIME OF EMERGENCY TRYING TO FIGURE YOUR WAY OUT OF HERE. AND SINCE I'VE BEEN PARTS PROCESS I HAVE STARTED LOOKING UP AT THE CEILINGS LOOKING FOR FIRE SPRINKLERS THAT I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE YET. SURE THERE ARE SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING BUT WHEN WE HAVE A STANDARD FOR EVERY OTHER BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA. IT SAYS THEY HAVE TO MEET ANY OF THESE PACIFIC GUIDELINES ESPECIALLY WITH. TO A DRESS ARE A ACCOMMODATE A PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND WE DON'T DO IT IN FACT I WAS UP AT. ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE ON FOURTH FLOOR I THINK IN THE OLD PART OF THE BUILDING. AND. I WAS THERE WAS A SCHEDULED A WHEELCHAIR TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE STAIRS AND LIFTED WORK. AND THIS PERSON IS TRYING TO TO DO THEIR JOB AND OR OR ADVOCATE FOR WHATEVER THEY WANTED ADVOCATE FOR AND THEY COULD NOT. ACCESS THE ROOM BECAUSE THE LIFTED WORK AND I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S A REAL INDICTMENT ON US IN. HOW WE'VE KEPT THIS BUILDING UP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO? A I KNOW THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A NEW BUILDING AND THAT THE POTENTIAL COST FOR A NEW BUILDING. BUT AT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BUILDINGS BEEN AROUND FOR SIXTY YEARS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THAT COME TO THIS BUILDING EVERY YEAR. I THINK WE OWE IT TO THEM TO A PROVIDING ADDICTS THAT IS A COMEDY INTO A TO ALL FOLKS. IS SAFE FED HAS PARK SPRINKLERS A I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SPRINKLER OCCASIONALLY. SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROCESS AND. I I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED. LESS FOR WITH WITH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE YOU BEEN CLUED ME ON ON EVERYTHING. A SINCE I BECAME A PART IS PROCESS AND IT'S REALLY AN EXCITING PROCESS AND REALLY. A VERY SELDOM DO PEOPLE GET TO BE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT IS HISTORIC IN NATURE AND IN THIS BUILDING A WE DO RIGHT COULD BE AROUND FOR ANOTHER SIXTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AND AND. BELONG LE BEYOND OUR LIFETIMES AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT SO AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK SO FAR AND AND. LET'S GET STARTED. SO ARE AS RETURN. I WILL POINT OUT. ONE OF THE S. IN THINGS ABOUT AND THINK THE PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS WE HAVE BEEN. WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING A LOT OF COURTHOUSES AROUND CALIFORNIA IN THE IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND THAT ACTUALLY HAS A VERY IMPORTANT BENCHMARK BECAUSE WE KNOW COURTHOUSES. HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF SECURITY THEY HAVE TO IN YOUR TECHNOLOGY. THEY HAVE HIGHER THAN AVERAGE FINISHES THEY NEED TO HAVE LARGE SPACES TO ACCOMMODATE JURY PULLS THE ACTUAL COURTROOM FOR SO THEMSELVES SO REQUIRE. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF ENGINEERING. TO ACCOMMODATE THE TRAFFIC VOLUMES IT MOVED THROUGH THE COURTHOUSES. SO ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE IS AT THIS MOMENT WE'RE CONCERNED WHAT WE MIGHT DO WITH OUR AN EX. WE HAVE AN AWFUL LOT OF DATA CONCERNING VERY SIMILAR BUILDINGS BEING BUILT ALL OVER CALIFORNIA AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. SO ITS NOT WERE NOT QUITE FLYING AS BLIND AS YOU MIGHT FEEL. A EVEN THOUGH IT SAY IT IS A NEW ISSUE FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE SUCH A PUBLIC FACILITIES OF THE SCALE ARE BEING BUILT ALL OVER AND THAT BECOMES IMPORTANT BENCHMARK SO WITH THAT. THE FIRM THAT WE HAVE USED IS CS EACH Q. WAY. INK. THEY HAVE ALSO WEST SACRAMENTO BOISE IDAHO. THERE WITH THIS YEAR WE HAVE WITH US. JOHN MULLIN OF WHO IS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT SINCE H. KUWAIT ALSO MARK GARY DIRECTOR AND SENIOR ARCHITECT WITH THE FIRM. DANIEL WEAVER SENIOR ARCHITECT WITH THEM AND STEVE WAKE WHEN PRINCE FOR MANAGING ARCHITECT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR THEM. SO MISTER MULLIN IF YOU WILL. TAKE US THROUGH THE REPORT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK. WELL I'D LIKE TO START WITH THANKING YOU ALL FOR ALLOWING US TO COME AND. DISCUSS THIS REPORT. THERE'S A LOT OF PAGES AND I THINK EVERYONE IS WORTH READING SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS COME WALKING THROUGH. HOW THE BOOK WAS A FORMER AIDE FORMATTED AND? OUR PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH TO ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE REPORT CELL. STARTING WITH I GUESS I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. SEES ISSUE A SPECIFICALLY. AND GIVE YOU KIND OF AND. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT OUR EXPERTISE ARE WHAT WE DO. WITH US. WITHOUT I GUESS I'D LIKE TO SAY THIS IS ISSUE IS BEEN AROUND FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE YEARS. NONE OF THOSE GUYS ARE STILL ALIVE. SHE LOVES IT WHEN I DO JOKES. OUR FIRST STARTED IN. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE THE FIRST AS A SOLE PROPRIETOR AND THEN AS A PARTNERSHIP AND NOW AS A. CORPORATION WE HAVE OFFICES IN WEST SACK DENVER COLORADO. AND IN BOISE IDAHO. WHERE FIRM OF AROUND A HUNDRED PEOPLE? AND ONE OF OUR EXPERTISE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON ARE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE OR CAPITOL BUILDINGS. THE TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS PROJECT. FOR THE STUDY HERE HAS WORKED ON NOW THREE CAPITOL BUILDINGS. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES AND THE WESTERN. SECTOR. IN SOME CASES THE PROJECTS WERE GROUND BEGINNING JUST TO WHERE YOU GUYS ARE OUT RIGHT NOW THE MASTER PLANNING PROGRAMMING. ASPECT IN IN SOME CASES WE WERE BROUGHT IN TO HELP RESCUE. PROJECTS WERE HAVING A HARD TIME CONTINUING. IN THIS CASE HERE WERE ONCE AGAIN INVOLVED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS WHICH I THINK IS THE MOST. IMPORTANT PART BECAUSE IT'S YOUR FIRST STEP FORWARD. AS WE AS WE LOOK AT THIS WITH THEIR PROJECTS WE'VE ACTUALLY WORKED ON IN THE PAST WE HAVE A FEW THINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY OFFER FROM OUR EXPERIENCE THAT WE THINK ARE. IN BE. USEFUL. THROUGH PROCESS BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THERE'S. MANY MORE ASPECTS TO DESERT DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING AN EXPANSION TO A CAPITOL BUILDING THEN. YOU MIGHT PARTICULARLY NO AT THIS POINT AND TIME. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WOULD SUGGEST IN ONE OF THOSE FIRST THINGS THAT I AM IS NOT NECESSARILY ILLUSTRATED IN A COST TO. FOR CONSTRUCTION BUDGET IS THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATION AND THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED IN THE BUILDING NOTIFICATION IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS YOU WORK ON THESE PROJECTS THAT YOU CONSIDER. YOUR INFORMATION. PROCESSING PROGRAMS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING TO VISIT YOUR CAPITOL BUILDING. DURING THE CONSTRUCTION CYCLE AND DURING THE DESIGN CYCLE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SEE IT FOR ONE LAST TIME AS IT CURRENTLY RESIDES. I'M YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A VERY WELL RUN INFORMATION PROGRAM BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU EVER THOUGHT INTERESTED IN THIS PROJECT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. ONE OF THE NEXT THINGS I THINK I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT WE FIND IN EVERY CAPITOL BUILDING WE'VE EVER. WORKED WITH OR BEEN TO IS THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE ENOUGH MEETING SPACE CONFERENCE SPACE. OR APPROPRIATE HEARING SPACES. GENERALLY SPEAKING. MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE MUCH LIKE YOU HAVE THEY'VE ADDED SOME INTO THEIR. CAPITOL COMPLEX SPECIFICALLY AND THEN THEY'VE HAD TO DO SOME REMOTING TO OF THAT. AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE ACTUALLY RESORTED TO THE USE OF ELECTRONICS FOR ALMOST. ALL THEIR INCLUSION OF THEIR A GENERAL POPULATION. YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS BUILDING TO. TO ACTUALLY GRASP THE SUBJECT AND MOVE IT FORWARD AND NOT ALLOW FOR BETTER HEARING SPACE BETTER MEETING SPACE. THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING. BUT BUILDINGS ARE SYMBOLS OF THIS TYPE ARE SYMBOLS. FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE ENDS FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES THAT THAT. THE DRAW PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THERE THEY ARE THE SYMBOL OF THE. GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. AS WE WORK ON THESE PROJECTS WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS. AS WE'RE DEVELOPING. DESIGNS AND THOSE WERE DEVELOPING WHY PEOPLE NEED TO BILL AND THE BUILDING AND HOW THE PEOPLE NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE BUILDING. MOST OF THE TIME WE FIND IS THAT THERE'S CONFLICTS IN SPACE USE. WE'VE TYPICALLY FOUND THAT THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH SPACE FOR ALL THE FUNCTIONAL NEEDS WITHIN A BUILDING IN THIS BUILDING WAS BUILT. SIXTY FIVE YEARS AGO FOR A PART TIME LEGISLATURE. IT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HOUSE WHAT FROM OUR VARIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THE USERS WITHIN THE BUILDING HOUSE ALL THE. CAPABILITY THAT. IS A DESIRED WITHIN THE BUILDING. ONE THING OF OF NOTE AND I THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING YOU'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT OVER TIME IS THAT THE BUILDING ITSELF. AS EXTRACTED PREDATES. ALL THE MODERN. BUILDING CODES HEALTH SAFETY CODES. ACCESSIBILITY COATS. AND. I CARRY NEEDS OF THE OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME. ALL THE BUILDINGS WE GOING TO TYPICALLY HAVE. AGING MECHANICAL AGING ELECTRICAL. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. AS RETROFITTED TECHNOLOGY NONE OF THESE BUILDINGS WERE BUILT WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THINK BACK FIFTY YEARS AGO. THERE WEREN'T CELLPHONES THEY WERE IN PREVALENT USE. LAPTOPS WERE AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE. THERE WERE DESKTOPS AND IF YOU DID HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING SOME SORT OF LOVABLE COMPUTER YOU COULD CARRY AROUND A COMPUTER AT A FOUR INCH SCREEN. TODAY THEY'RE UBIQUITOUS EVERY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO THOSE NEED TO BE THOUGHT OUT WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE LIKE IN FIFTY YEARS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY INFRASTRUCTURE CAN SUPPORT THAT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE NOW WE HAVEA BETTER EYE. ON WHERE GOV OUR COUNTRY IS GOING AND AREN'T OUR WORLD IS GOING. OF CURRENT TODAY. IS EVERYBODY IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE SECURITY SECURITY IN THESE KIND OF BUILDINGS AS I SAID THEY'RE BEACONS. MAKING SURE YOU MAINTAIN SECURITY OF ALL THE VISITORS MAY TO MAINTAIN SECURITY OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THE BUILDING AND SECURITY TAKES ON MANY DIFFERENT FACES. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUILDING TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION HOW DO YOU HANDLE A BUSLOAD OF VISITORS. AND HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAN A POTENTIAL FIRE WITHIN THE BUILDING AND HOW DOES EVERYBODY GET OUT OF BUILDING THAT'S PART OF SECURITY CONCERNS AT THIS BUILDING. IS ACTUALLY LIMITED AT THIS POINT TIME AND. MARK HERE IN A MINUTE HERE WILL TALK. THROUGH SOME OF THE BUILDING DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE. ILLUSTRATING WITHIN OUR BLOCK. BUILDINGS OF THIS TYPE TYPICALLY HOUSE SEPARATE TENANTS WITH SIMILAR GOALS YOU END UP WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE YOU END UP WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN MANY CASES JOINED UP WITH ELECTED OFFICIAL OFFICES ALL IN THE SAME BUILDING. THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT BUT SIMILAR PURPOSES THAT THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE MAINTAIN THOSE KIND OF ASPECTS OF. HOW THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL? OUR REQUIREMENTS ARE FACILITATE THE ACCESS TO CONSTITUENTS. MAINTAIN THE GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. ALL WORKING IN THE BUILDING AND ON THE BUILDING DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE. IN THIS IS ONE OF MY. CABBIE OUTSIDE ALL OF THIS THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ELECTED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THIS. GATHERING IN BRINGING TOGETHER EVERYBODY WITH A SIMILAR IN COMMON VISION TO BE ABLE TO PROCEED AHEAD IS PARAMOUNT TO MAKE THE PROCESS MOVE SMOOTHLY. WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROJECT RESTARTED IT WITH ESSENTIALLY FIVE OPTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN NO PARTICULAR BIAS TO ANY ONE OF THESE AS WE STARTED BUT WE WANTED TO START AND THE CONSERVATIVE NATURE. WE START WITH THE IDEA THAT MAYBE ALL WE REALLY HAVE TO DO IS FIX IT UP. CAN KEEP THE BUILDING AS IT IS WE CAN. AND IN. MOST ARCHITECTS WORTH THEIR SALT CAN SOLVE MOST OF THE. ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES. BUT THERE'S A LOT THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN THIS BUILDING AND THERE'S A LOT OF NEED TO EXPRESS DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE. USERS OF THE BUILDING THAT WE CANNOT OVERCOME JUST BY FIXING IT UP AS IT IS. OUR WE LOOKED AT REMODELING THE BUILDING. WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AS INVASIVE AS. PRETTY MUCH THE REST OF WHAT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THE BUILDING TO REMODEL MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE MAINTAINED. FOR PARTS OF THE BUILDING AND MOST THESE BUILDINGS WERE NOT ACTUALLY DESIGNED WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SHUT OFF THIS OFFICE IN TURN THIS OFFICE ON HERE. SO. GENERALLY SPEAKING UP TO RELOCATE OUT OF THE BUILDING TO BE ABLE TO DO A FULL REMODEL. IT WOULD NOT ACTUALLY. GIVE YOU ALL THE BENEFITS IN THE REMODEL ANY MUCH MORE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU WOULD GET. IN. SIMPLY CHANGING THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU CURRENTLY NO THERE WITHIN THE BUILDING. THIRDLY AS WE LOOKED AT IT WE SAID THEN ONE OF THE BETTER OPTIONS MIGHT BE ADDING ON TO THE BUILDING SO WE STARTED OUT WITH THE IDEA. THAT WHAT IF WE JUST REMODELED THE PARTS WE HAD IN AND OUT ADD ON TO THE BUILDING WE COULD WE ACTUALLY SATISFY THE NEEDS. THEIR EXPRESSED TO US OR VARIOUS MEETINGS. AS IT CAME TO BE WE FOUND THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT WORKING WITHIN THE EXISTING STRUCTURAL GREG WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND THE FLOOR TO CEILING HEIGHTS WITHIN THE BUILDING TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE BEING ABLE TO APPLY ALL THE DESIRES AND NEEDS THAT WERE EXPRESSED TO US DURING OUR CONVERSATION. ULTIMATELY WE CAME TO. AND THE WITHIN THE ACTUAL BILL THAT. PUT THIS FORWARD IT WAS ABOUT REMOVING AND REPLACING THE BUILDING OR. REMODELING THE BUILDING AND SO WE ACTUALLY EXPANDED UPON THAT AS WE WENT THROUGH TO SAY WHAT OTHER OPTIONS YOU MAY HELP AVAILABLE. ULTIMATELY FALL UPON THEY REMOVE AND REPLACE OPTION WITHIN THE. REPLACES BUILDING WITHIN. THE EXISTING LOCATION. AND THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE OPTION OF BUILDING A NEW BUILDING OUR NEW BUILDINGS AS SOME PEOPLE MAY HAVE SEEN. ALREADY PUBLISHED IT AND DURING POINT TIME IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION. THROUGH OUR REPORT HERE AS WE TALK HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE IS WHY WE CAME TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS THAT WE CAME TO. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE ROOM MOVING REPLACE WAS THE ONE THAT. WAS THEM MOST EASY TO SATISFY ALL THE DESIRES OF THE. CODE ISSUES ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES. AND. ALL OF THE NEEDS FOR THE ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE WITHIN THE BUILDINGS WOULD BE CAN. MORE CONSISTENTLY DONE AND RESOLVE SOME OF THE WAY FUNDING ISSUES THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW OF. BUILDING IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION WAS CONSIDERED STRONGLY VOTE WAS. RESOUND ONLY RESENT. I'D TAKEN OFF THE LIST BECAUSE OF PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF BEING SEPARATED FROM THE CHAMBERS. AND SEPARATED FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND HAVING TO WALK ACROSS STE. AN AREA OF SURFACE TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK AND FORTH IN A TIMELY FASHION TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT HEARINGS AND EVERYTHING STARTED ON TIME. WHAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH ON OUR NEXT SLIDE HERE IS? ONE OF THE ONE OF THE QUOTES THAT WERE PROVIDED. PART OF THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS YOU'LL FIND IT WITHIN THE BOOK. AND YOU ALSO FIND IN ON THE BACK COVER THE BOOK IT WAS PROVIDED TO US BY ASSEMBLYMAN COOLEY WHICH WE ACTUALLY THOUGHT WAS. VERY APROPOS FOR ACTUALLY MOST OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND I'LL JUST READ IT TO YOU QUICKLY. THE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAPITAL ANNEX SHOULD CONVEY THAT TO THE VISITORS. CALIFORNIA'S POSITIVE AND HOPEFUL HOLE FILLED OUTLOOK. FOUNDED UPON A DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY WHICH UNFOLDS THERE. BY WELCOMING ALL CALIFORNIANS ENGAGING ALL CALIFORNIANS SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND DEMONSTRATING A HEALTHFUL. ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE DESIGN. LET ME STOP THERE REAL QUICK SO WHERE ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT IS SAYING IS THAT THE BUILDING SHOULD BE ENGAGING TO EVERYONE. AND BY DEMONSTRATING BEING EXAMPLE FOR YOUR STATE. OF THE KIND OF ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTION YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. WHILE PRESERVING THE BEAUTY AND VISTAS. OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGACY CAPITOL PARK. AND INVITING ALL GUESTS ALL OF ITS GUESTS. TO EXPLORE AND TAKE PRIDE IN ONE OF THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITALS IN THE NATION. I THINK IT'S VERY ASPIRATIONAL AND I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY. HISTORICALLY ACCURATE AND WHAT A CAPITOL BUILDING WOULD LIKE TO HAVE DONE. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. ARE JENNIFER WE'RE GONNA BE PRESENTING TO YOU AND I HAVE MARK YOU'RE HERE WILL BE TALKING RIGHT AFTER ME AND DANIEL WEAVER WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK. ABOUT. THESE ITEMS THAT ARE ON THE AGENDA HERE. THE SLIDES WILL GENERALLY START WITH THESE TITLE SO YOU CAN FOLLOW THROUGH. ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WILL BE SHOWING YOU A SPECIFIC PAGES OUT OF THE BLOCKS THE THE YOU CAN SEE THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO SHOW YOU IS HOW TO READ THE BOOK AND HOW TO FOLLOW THROUGH THE BOOK AND WHY WE DID WHAT WE DID WITHIN THE. REPORT. REPORT. IT'S LIKE. SO PLANNING STUDY AND SUMMARY OF STUDY EFFORTS. THE PURPOSE FOR THE STUDY. AS WE WERE SETTING OUT. WAS TO ROUTE. REMEDY THE EXISTING BUILDING DEFICIENCIES AND ENHANCE THE ABILITY. OF THE FACILITY. TO MEET THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. WHAT YOU'LL FIND WITHIN THE REPORT? IS SECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH INFORMATION GATHERING AND BACKGROUND. GOAL SETTING. WHICH WE CALL DESIGN GOALS. IT'S LIKE. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS. OF WHICH WE HAVE SOME TWO DOZEN PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS ILLUSTRATED WITHIN THE BOOK. A FEW THOSE ARE SUCH THINGS AS. MAINTAINING THE BEAUTY OF THE HISTORICAL. PARK AS WELL AS MAINTAINING THE HIGHER KEY OF THE CAPITOL BUILDING. WHATEVER PLAYING CONSIDERATIONS IS KNOWN STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES THE BUILDING ITSELF WOULD HAVE BASED ON STUDIES PROVIDED TO US. THROUGH THE DG ES UM FACILITY ASSESSMENT. THERE'S KNOWN STRUCTURAL DEFICIENCIES FOR SEISMIC AT FOR YOUR TO COMPLY WITH TODAY'S MODERN BUILDING CODES. ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT I THINK YOU'RE IS PARAMOUNT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS. DURING CONSTRUCTION. IN ALL CASES EXCEPT FOR FIX IN PLACE. YOU WOULD NEED TO HAVE WHAT WE CLASSIFY SWING SPACES WHICH ARE SPACES WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE OCCUPANTS OF THE BUILDING AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC THEMSELVES. WOULD BE RELOCATED TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. AND THE. THUS PRECIPITATING THE WHOLE PUBLIC INFORMATION SYSTEM SO THEY KNOW WHERE TO GO AND HOW TO USE THE CAPITOL BUILDING DURING CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. AND. LASTLY I'LL JUST NOTE HERE OUT OF THE TWO DOZEN WE HAVE. THE DIRECT CONNECT OF THIS BUILDING TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING ITSELF THE. HISTORIC UP NOBODY. THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN A VERY SENSITIVE SORT OF WAY AND DURING CONSTRUCTION THAT'S ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS IS MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE NOT LEFT THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE EXISTING. HISTORICAL CAPITOL BUILDING WHICH WILL MAY BE MAINTAINED. AND IN A STATE WHERE IT CAN BE UTILIZED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE THE CHAMBERS. YOU CAN UTILIZE THE HEARING SPACES IN THE MEETING ROOMS WITHIN THE HISTORIC CAPITAL WHILE THIS CONSTRUCTION GOES ON BUT THAT WILL BE A PLANNING CONSIDERATION DURING THE ACTUAL DESIGN. IF I MAY JUMP IN FOR JUST A MOMENT YOU BETCHA ON THIS POINT. A ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE IS WE HAVE TO CHAMBERS THE HISTORIC CHAMBERS. BUT AS SOON AS YOU STEP OUT OF THE CHAMBERS FOR EXAMPLE THE SENATE SIDE. OUR THE MATTED LOUNGE THE DAVE THE SERGEANTS OFFICE ROOM THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE YOU'RE VERY USEFUL HEARING ROOM. A THESE ARE ALL IN THE ANNEX. SEVERE ADDRESSING THE ANNEX YOU ACTUALLY AFFECT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CHAMBERS. AND SO A LONG TERM STRATEGY HAS TO WE HAD WE RETAIN THAT FUNCTIONALITY. FOR THE MEMBERS. THE OTHER THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS AND I WANT TO POINT TO THIS CHART DO YOU SEE DOWN THERE THAT COLORFUL CHART ON THE FAR WALL. THAT'S ACTUALLY DO ONE THE UNIQUE VALUE ADS OF THIS REPORT DONE BY THIS FIRM. AS HE TALKED TO PEOPLE. THEY'VE. KEPT TRACK OF WHERE TO MEMBERS SPEND THEIR TIME. WHEN A MEMBER RISE IN THE BILL AND ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE DOING DURING THE DAY. AND THAT CHARTER IS BASS HE SHOWS AT THE TOP YOU ENTER YOU HAD YOUR OFFICE YOU CAN READ TO HEARING ROOM. YOU MAY BE PRESENT TO HER LONG RUN TO ANOTHER HEARING WILL PRESENT A BILL BACK TO THE ROOM. YOU CAN GO TO SEE LEADERSHIP PEOPLE GO TO CAUCUS YOU GO TO CHAMBERS. YOU CAN VISIT ANOTHER MEMBER. WE GET A LOT DONE IN A VERY COMPACT SPACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE OF THIS ORIENTATION OF WEST WING ANNEX. THAT MAKES EVERYONE OF OUR DAYS EXTRAORDINARILY PRODUCTIVE. AND I WILL SAY IS ACTUALLY PRETTY UNIQUE IS DEFINITELY WASHINGTON MODEL. AND MOST OTHER STATES LAWMAKERS IN THAT HAVE. HIKE ALL OVER THE PLACE TO GET THEIR WORK DONE SO IT'S SORT OF DEGRADES WHAT THEY CAN KNOCK OUT IN A DAY. SO I THINK AS HE TALKS ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF. LOOK AT THESE RELATIONSHIPS. I WANT TO JUST PUT A FLAG ON THAT CHART BECAUSE I THINK. THAT REVEALS A LOT ABOUT HOW WE ARE PRODUCTIVE. PLEASE CONTINUE PARTLY. I THANK YOU I'D ACTUALLY I I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH WHAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WE HAVE. HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. INDIVIDUALLY AND IN DIFFERENT GROUPINGS TO VISIT. QUITE A FEW CAPITOL BUILDINGS pFUNCTION ALSO AND HOW THEY'VE DONE THEIR RENOVATION PROJECTS I'VE. PERSONALLY BEEN TO ABOUT TWELVE AMONG THE. EASTERN SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES I'M GOT TO TOO MANY SOUTHERN. I CAPITALS BUT IT'S BEEN. VERY NICK FOR US TO BECAUSE YOU'RE CAPITOL BUILDING IS IN A UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE YOU TOOK A HISTORIC CAPITAL AND YOU PUT THE OFFICE BUILDING. DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE CAPITOL BUILDING IN THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN TERRIBLY OFTEN. ULTIMATELY I GUESS IS WE WALK THROUGH OUR REPORT WE. LOOK THE TABULAR DATA. AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY SPREADSHEETS. WE LOOKED AT THE SURVEYS AND REPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE PAST. WE LOOKED AT INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO US THAT WAS FROM THE SIXTIES FROM THE SEVENTIES. AND SOME INFORMATION WE HAVE FROM THE EIGHTIES. THAT INFORMATION HELPED FEED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE DESIRES AND NEEDS FOR THE CAPITAL WERE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. THE WORLD IS CHANGED A LOT SINCE SOME OF THOSE STUDIES WERE OUT THERE. GOVERNMENT WAS A PART TIME LEGISLATURE AND OF WHICH IT IS NOT NOW. AND THE WAY THAT THE PUBLIC ACTUALLY CAN GET TO AND GET INFORMATION FROM THE CAPITALIST CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. THE SPREADSHEETS THEN TALLY UP THE. WAY THE CURRENT BUILDING WORKS AND THE ADJACENT SEASON ARE CURRENTLY WITHIN THE BUILDING TO LOOK FOR. IT EITHER ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL AS WHEN WE DID PROJECTIONS. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS AND BASED ON A PROGRAMMING EFFORT WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT LATER. TO HOW MANY PEOPLE. THE BUILDING ACTUALLY NEED TELL ME HEARING ROOMS THE BUILDING ACTUALLY NEEDS AND WE WE. BALANCE THOSE TWO. SPREADSHEETS OFF OF EACH OTHER AND ULTIMATELY. WE. WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING YOU WITH IN THE BOOK. CONCLUSIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS. SO THE NEXT LIKE PLEASE SO NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO IS JUST TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS WERE TO CREATE SOME OF THE SECTIONS WITHIN THE BOOK. THE INFORMATION GATHERING UNKNOWN DOCUMENTS AS I SAID WAS TO CALL THROUGH HISTORIC DOCUMENTATION. GENERATE. INFORMATION BASED ON THE KNOWN AND EXISTING FACILITIES THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE. AND TRY TO ANALYZE WHY IS IT BEING DONE THAT WAY. THERE WAS DIFFICULT FOR US TO ACTUALLY INITIALLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHILE THE SINK WHEN TOGETHER BUT AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS WHICH WE USE ALL OF THESE SMALL BITS OF DETAILS TO% UNDERSTAND YOUR GOVERNMENT HOPEFULLY BETTER THAN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOU WORK WITHIN YOUR OWN WALLS BECAUSE. YOU'RE DOING A JOB AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE HOW YOUR GHOSTS ARE MOVING AROUND. PARTICIPATING IN HIGH LEVEL GOAL SETTING MEETINGS THIS RIGHT HERE IS A POIGNANT TIME WITHIN THE PROJECT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS. WHAT WOULD YOU ASPIRE TO HAVE THIS BUILDING TO? DOES THE CURRENT BUILDING APPLY WELL TO YOUR ASPIRATIONS OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE THIS BUILDING TO DO. WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS WE TALK TO. CAPITAL OCCUPANTS AND LEADERS TWO I GENERATE A LIST OF GOALS WHICH DANIEL WEAVER WILL WALK YOU THROUGH HERE IN A FEW MINUTES. WE CONDUCTED INTERVIEWS AS I'VE MENTIONED A COUPLE TIMES THOSE INTERVIEWS WERE YOU INTERVIEWED SOME FIFTY PLUS PEOPLE. AND TALK TO MORE THAN THAT BUT. WE DID ACTUALLY ARTICULATE ALL THEIR NAMES BUT MOST OF THOSE ARE ILLUSTRATED WITH IN THE BOOK. OF THE PEOPLE THAT SAT DOWN WITH US AND GAVE US INFORMATION WE TOLD THEM THAT WE WOULD TAKE THEIR INFORMATION WITHOUT. BIAS TO THE INFORMATION AND WE DIDN'T NAME ANYBODY FOR THEIR SPECIFIC INFORMATION THEY GAVE US SO THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE IN TELLING US ANYTHING THEY WANTED TO TELL US AND WE THINK WE GOT A VERY HONEST. AN OPEN CONVERSATION WITH THEM. ULTIMATELY WHAT WE DID IS WE GENERATED A. A PROGRAMMING DOCUMENT WHICH ALL ALSO TALK ABOUT LATER ON HERE. WHICH IS A SPREADSHEET OF DESIRED ROOMS IN SIZES. AND EVENTUALLY HERE AS I SAID WE DEVELOPED. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. OUR RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS ILLUSTRATED WITH IN THE BOOK. IS THAT YOU WOULD REMOVE AND REPLACE THE EXISTING CAPITAL ANNEX. IT STRUCK THE NEW APPROPRIATELY SIZED. ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITAL ANNEX IN THE SAME LOCATION. OUR ASSUMPTIONS ARE WITH THAT RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU WE COMPLY WITH ALL MODERN CODES. ALL ACCESSIBILITY NEEDS. AND BE VERY INCLUSIVE IN THE PROCESS. SO AT THIS POINT. TIRED HEAR ME TALK ABOUT PASSES ON TO MARK YOUR WHO IS GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH THE EXISTING BUILDING DEFICIENCIES AND THEN PROGRESSED TO. CASA GRADUATION. THANKS JOHN. THIS SLIDE THAT SHOWN IS FROM PAGE TEN THE PLANNING BOOK. AND OUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING IS BASED ON THE BOOK AND SO IS JOHN MENTIONED WE WILL OCCASIONALLY SHOW SLIDES DIRECT FROM THE BOOK JUST ORIENT YOU AS WE GO ALONG. IN ON THIS ON THIS PAGE THERE'S A. TWELVE. TWELVE DEFICIENCIES ARE TWELVE GENERAL CATEGORIES FOR DEFEAT SEES THAT WE FOUND WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND GETTING ALL THE DEFICIENCIES LUMPED INTO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. REALLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR HERE'S DEFICIENCIES. BUT LIMIT THE ROLE OF THE ANNEX FULLY ACHIEVING ITS. ROLE AS A VENUE. FOR GOVERNMENTAL PROCESSES BUT ALSO FOR ALLOWING FOR FOR. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SO THOSE WERE OUR FOCUS FOR BUILDING EFFICIENT. IT WILL GO THROUGH THESE INDIVIDUALLY NOW BUT THEY'RE LOCATED ON PAGES TEN TO THIRTY OF THE BOOK. FIRST ONE LIFE SAFETY BUILDING CODE DEFICIENCIES WE MENTION THIS BEFORE. AND AND PRIMARILY TO THE AGE OF THE ANNEX THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LIFE SAFETY DEFICIENCIES THAT EXIST WITHIN THE BUILDING. AND JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW. ACCESS TO EXITS IT'S WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS REALLY THE THE ABILITY FOR AND IN INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS IN THE BUILDING OR A GUEST TO GET TO THAT EXIT. BUT ALONG THE WAY THERE'S GOING TO BE EXIT WITH IMPACT IMPAIRMENTS AND WE SEE EXIT WITS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S OF HALLWAYS BUT WERE ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT THE DOORWAYS AT A SPACES AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S OF STAIRWAYS SO IT'S IT IMPACTS THE HORIZONTAL CIRCULATION AS WELL AS THE VERTICAL CIRCULATION. NOT ENOUGH WITH SIMPLY PUT. AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING IT THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT DOWN IN THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE BASEMENT IS WHERE THAT DOES EXIST. AND IF AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A. CHO DEFICIENCY IS IF THE IF THE BUILDING WAS BUILT TODAY IF THIS ANNEX WAS BUILT UNDERSEA MODERN BUILDING CODES IT WOULD HAVE MORE LATERAL BRACING MORE SEISMIC BRACING EARTHQUAKE EARTHQUAKE BRACING. DID WHAT THIS BUILDING CURRENTLY HAS. THE SECOND ONE IS NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT THE EIGHTY EIGHT. THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE IN AND AGAIN LARGELY DUE TO THE AGE THE BUILDING. AND AND BUT THESE ARE PROBLEMS THAT IMPACT THOSE WHO WORK IN THE BUILDING. BUT ALSO IMPACT. ACCESS FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET INTO THE BUILDING IN TO MEET WITH THEIR MEET WITH THEIR LAWMAKERS. SO REALLY ALL PAP O. PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS BUILDING THIS MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND IN THE BUILDING SHOULD NOT LIMIT. IN IN SOME CAPACITY RIGHT NOW IT DOES. THE SPECIFIC SPECIFICS OF THAT ACCESS OR FOR WORK SPACES. MEETING AREAS AND TOILET FACILITIES THE TOILET FACILITIES. IS I'M SURE IS GENERALLY KNOWN ARE THERE'S TOO FEW OF THEM AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THEIR THEIR TOO SMALL SO JUST ACCESS TO THOSE. IS DIFFERENT IMPEDIMENT. ONE OTHER. SLIGHTLY MORE DETAILED ITEM IS. IN IN HERE IN A ROOM SUCH AS THIS THERE'S WAYS TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER ENHANCEMENTS FOR IMPROVED ASSISTED LISTENING. SYSTEMS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE VOTE THE PUBLIC WHO COMES IN AND AND MAYBE HEARING IMPAIRED. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN ISSUES IS ANOTHER DEFICIENCY THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN JUST REAL SIMPLY PUT THE EXISTING. ANNEXES NOT ENERGY EFFICIENT. THE I THIS BUILDING SHOULD STRIVE TO BE A NET ZERO. ENERGY FACILITY. EXISTING ENVELOPE AND EXISTING SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BUILDING JUST DON'T. CURRENTLY ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. ANOTHER FOSTER A COUPLE OF THE FAUCETS OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN THOUGH IS. MATERIAL ON SYSTEM SELECTION IN A SUSTAINABLE BUILDING THAT MATERIALS SHOULD BE LONG LASTING SHOULD BE TIMELESS EASILY MAINTAINED. AND REDUCE GLOBAL GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL. AND CURRENTLY NOT ALL THE SYSTEMS IN AND FINISHES IN THIS BUILDING MEET THAT CRITERIA. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST IDEALLY IN ASSISTING WILL DESIGN BUILDING HERE A BUILDING WITH SUSTAINABLE DESIGN YOU HAVE. FIXTURES THAT ARE LOW WATER USE SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SINKS WERE TALKING ABOUT TOILETS MORE TALK ABOUT URINALS. OVERCROWDING IS IS OUR FOURTH DEFICIENCY IN THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT ONE AND WE HEARD ABOUT THIS. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT DURING OUR INTERVIEWS BUT WE'VE ALSO OBSERVED IT FIRST HAND THAT PROBABLY EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS OBSERVED THIS FIRST HAND. PARTICULARLY DURING THAT DURING SESSION OF COURSE BUT THERE'S CONGESTION IN THE HALLWAYS BUT THERE'S ALSO CONGESTION IN THE BACK WORK AREAS THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC MAY NOT EXPERIENCE OR SEE. AND SO THERE'S CODE IMPACTS TO THIS OVERCROWDING. BUT ALSO THE THE OVERCROWDING CREATES BUILDING OR CREATES BUSINESS INEFFICIENT. THE. THIS ENGINE DOESN'T CHURN QUITE AS WELL AS IT COULD IF IT HAD A LITTLE MORE SPACE A LITTLE MORE. MORE ROOMS MORE MEETING ROOMS PARTICULARLY. AND OVERCROWDING THOUGH DOES IT IN TO US LIMIT THE PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO COME IN AND. ME WITH THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS OR PERHAPS TESTIFIED A PUBLIC HEARING. NEXT IMAGE PLEASE. A SAFETY OF USER CONCERNS THAT WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SECURITY FOR THE BUILDING OCCUPANCY GAS. AND WE DID DURING OUR INTERVIEWS HAVE DISCUSSIONS LIKE THE DISCUSSIONS ON SECURITY. AT THAT DO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BUT THEY BASICALLY FALL INTO TWO GENERAL CATEGORIES. ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY. THE SECURITY SYSTEM SHOULD BE STATE OF THE ART SIMPLY PUT. BUT ALSO THERE'S SOME PHYSICAL ENHANCEMENTS COULD BE DONE TO THE BUILDING AND SOME OF THESE ARE SIGNIFICANT FOR EXAMPLE TAKING THE PARKING THAT'S CURRENTLY. UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING FOOTPRINTS AND MOVING THAT OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING FOOTPRINT THAT'S A A PHYSICAL RESTRAINT RIGHT NOW TO THE BUILDING THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED. CONFUSING WAY FINDING AND PUBLIC ACCESS AND THESE ISSUES START WITH THE SITE. WHEN PEOPLE APPROACH THE BUILDING. I THINK A LOT OF FIRST TIME USERS THEY WANNA GRAVITATE TOWARD THE STORK WEST WING. IS A APPROACH THIS THEY REALIZED TO GET IN THEY NEED TO GO OVER TO. A LITTLE DIFFERENT AREA FOR THOSE TO GAIN ENTRY TO THE SECURITY CHECKPOINTS. AND THIS CREATES CONGESTION IF THOSE CHECKPOINTS AND IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THAT ON THE NORTH SIDE THERE'S THE. THE COUNTY DISPLAYSTHAT CREATES A BOTTLENECK IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENTRY. BUT INTERNAL CIRCULATION ONCE THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING THERE IS THAT CONFUSION IN A LOT OF THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING. INHERENT IN THE NATURE OF BUILDING THE SIZE IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE WEST WING THE THE DIFFERENCES IN ELEVATION BUT JUST THE THE SIZE OF THE BUILDING. SO THAT WAY FINDING IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. FEELING TOILET AND PLUMBING SYSTEMS. I MITCHELL BEFORE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT TOILET ROOMS. BUT ALSO DRINKING FOUNTAINS THEY SHOULD HAVE BOTTLED WATER FILLERS IDEALLY ON THEM. AND WE USE THE TERM FAILING TOILET THERE BECAUSE WERE AWARE OF SOME. FEELING PIPES THAT HAVE LITERALLY BURST THERE'S BEEN SOME LEAKS THERE'S BEEN SOME PROBLEMS IN THE BUILDING BETTER. LOCALLY ON ONE FLOOR BUT ALSO IMPACTED THE FLOOR BELOW. AT LEAST AGING MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND DURING THE INTERVIEWS WE WE HEARD A GREAT DEAL ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH THERMAL COMFORT. AND A D. G. S. DID GET COMPLIMENTED ON THEIR WRISTS. IT'S PROBLEMS. YOU'RE GOOD. A AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WITH THE AGEING MECHANICAL SYSTEMS ARE JUST SIMPLY NOT ENERGY EFFICIENT. UNDERSIZED ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WE DID ANALYZE THE EXISTING AMPERAGE INTO THE BUILDING THE. WHAT COOL JUICE INTO THE BUILDING AND FOUND IT TO BE UNDERSIZED IN OUR REPORT IT'S IN THE REPORTED IT'S IDENTIFIED THERE AND MORE? THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THAT BUT IT IS LOW. BUT ALSO THE POWER DISTRIBUTION WITH IN THE BUILDING IS OUTDATED. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IF THERE NEEDS TO BE A REPAIR DONE IN THE BUILDING IT APPEARS TO US THAT A LARGE CHUNK OF THE BUILDING MIGHT NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF LINE TO DO THAT REPAIR. IS OPPOSED TO A MORE ADVANCED. OR SOME MODERN ELECTRICAL BACKBONE THAT WOULD ENABLE A LITTLE BUT MORE NIMBLE AND TACTICAL ABILITIES TO DO SMALL REMODELS UPGRADES IS THEY NEED IS A NEED TO BE DONE. COINCIDENTALLY WITH THAT OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY. IS THE BUILDING HAS GROWN IN TECHNOLOGY IS GROWN. THE ACT. A COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS WITHIN THE BUILDING AND TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING ARE. THERE PUT WHERE THEY COULD FIT. THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEET CODE. IN IT CLOSETS ARE NOT DENTED NOTE HAVE A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THE TECHNO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN. INADEQUATE CONFERENCING SPACES THIS IS THIS IS A HUGE ONE AND. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH IN THE ANNEX. THERE SHOULD BE MORE FORMAL HEARING ROOMS. IN A VARIETY OF SIZES BUT ALSO MORE INFORMAL SPACES. IN THE INFORMAL SPACES OR OUR SOME OF WHAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T SEE BUT WHAT WE'VE OBSERVED IS. IF THERE NEEDS TO BE MEETINGS HELD WITHIN WORKERS WHO WORK AT THOSE WHO WORK IN THE BUILDING THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO. GOOD PLACE FOR THEM TO DO THAT. AND ALSO THOUGH THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY TO THE PUBLIC TO COME AND NOW WE'VE HEARD NUMEROUS TIMES OF. THE PUBLIC COMES IN THERE'S NO GOOD THEY WANT TO MEET WITH THEIR. MEET WITH SOMEONE THERE'S NO GOOD PLACE TO DO THAT THOSE CAN SPELL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY. AND NOT AN IDEAL SITUATION. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST OTHER PUBLIC AND WORKING SPACE DEFICIENCIES. OF THE WHAT'S ON THE SLIDE THERE HAS. A NUMBER OF THOSE ON THE LIST GOT PRIMARILY THOSE MISALIGNED FLOORS IS ONE THAT I THINK IMPACTS THE THE FUNCTION OF THE BUILDING. AND THE ALSO THOUGH AMENITIES FOR WORKERS FOR ENHANCING THEIR ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOBS IN AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY. NEXT UP. WE WANT TO TALK. ABOUT ESTIMATED. INSTRUCTION COSTS. AND ON THE NEXT SLIDE. IN THIS IS FROM PAGE EIGHTY. OF THE PLANNING STUDY BOOK THERE WERE THREE. COST EVALUATIONS DONE. THE FIRST IS REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ANNEX THE OTHER ONE IS NEW PARKING STRUCTURE. IN A NEW VISITOR CENTER AND PUBLIC ACCESS THOSE OF THE THREE COSTS YOU SEE HERE IN THOSE AND WE DID THESE THREE SEPARATE COSTS BECAUSE THEY REALLY NEEDED TO BE EVALUATED DIFFERENTLY. FROM ONE ANOTHER AND WE WANTED TO BUDGET AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT FOR EACH ITEM. SO MOVING INTO THE REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE ANNEX. THE EVALUATION WAS DONE. PRICING OF AN APPROPRIATELY SIZED. NEW ANNEX. OUR VALUATION WAS DONE ASSUMING THAT NEW ANNEX WOULD BE VACATED. AND THE CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE DONE ALL AT ONCE. AND IT IS JOHN MENTIONED EARLY EARLIER JOHN ALLUDED TO ITS ITS MOST EFFICIENT TO DO IT THAT WAY WITH WE FEEL ITS MOST EFFICIENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT. TO MAINTAIN ITS PROCESSES FOR THE BUILDING TO BE HOLISTICALLY DONE AT ONCE. BUT ALSO FROM ITS CONSTRUCTION STANDPOINT IT'S MOST EFFICIENT THAT WAY AS WELL TO TRY TO LIMIT THE CONSTRUCTION DURATION. SWING SPACES HORSE WILL SPACES FOR RELOCATION THAT JOHN TALKED ABOUT ARE ARE NOT IN THE ESTIMATE. IN THERE'S THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT VEHICLES FOR ACHIEVING THOSE SWING SPACES WHERE WHERE THE WHERE THE BUSINESS NEEDS TO HAPPEN DURING CONSTRUCTION. AND IT COULD BE NEW CONSTRUCTION COULD BE BUILT NEW NEW SQUARE FOOTAGE COULD BE PROVIDED FOR THAT OR IT COULD BE. A EXISTING SPACE BE REMODELED WERE THIRD COULD BE. RENTAL RENTING EXISTING SPACES AND AND BASED ON OUR PAST EXPERIENCE RENTING IS USUALLY THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO GO. BUT THERE MAY BE SOME COMBINATION DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY OUT THERE THAT WOULD DETERMINE THOSE IMPACTS IN THOSE THOSE PRICES. SO THAT WOULD BE A STUDY THAT WOULD NEED TO BE. IT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE. OUR BUDGET CONSTRUCTION COST. FOR REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT ANNEXES APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. ON THE NEW PARKING STRUCTURE ON THE SLIDE OUR EVALUATION INCLUDED REMOVAL OF THE PARKING. FROM UNDERNEATH THE BUILDING AND PROVIDING A NEW PARKING STRUCTURE SEPARATE FROM THE ANNEX. IN THE SIZE OF THIS WAS DONE BY OUR INTERVIEWS ARE OURS DURING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE SIZE OF THAT. BUT ALSO INCLUDES LOADING DOCK AND GOVERNOR'S PARKING AREA. IF IT IF IT REMAINS ON SITE. IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE UNDERGROUND. TO. MAINTAIN VIEWS TO THE CAPITOL TO MAINTAIN THE CHARACTER. OF THE CAPITOL MALL. IT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE UNDERGROUND OR IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. ON SITE IT COULD BE IN SOME ADJACENT LOT ARE ARE ARE COST IS IT SO ASSUMING IT TO BE UNDERGROUND ADJACENT TO THE CAPITAL. AND WE HAVE SOME ROUGH. APPROXIMATION STUDIES OF THIS BUT HAVEN'T DONE ANY GREAT OUT WAIT TO SEE WHERE IT WOULD FIT. A BUDGET COST BUDGET CONSTRUCTION COST OF THIS SIX AND A HALF MILLION. IN LAST PUBLIC ACCESS VISITORS CENTER FOR THE FIFTY PLUS YEAR LIFESPAN OF THE BUILDING. WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE PUBLIC ACCESS TO PRIORITY. AND THESE COSTS ADDRESS SITE IS THE APPROACH TO THE SITE. ACUITY ENTRIES BUT ALSO AREAS WITHIN THE ANNEX. DO COST TO INCLUDE OUR PREFER PROVIDING FOR A NEW VISITOR CENTER. FOR THE PUBLIC. AND THIS WOULD BE REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE VISITOR EXPERIENCE IS THEY APPROACHED THE CAPITAL. A COULD FUNNEL THEM INTO THE WEST WING WHERE A GREAT DEAL OF THEM WANT TO GO. THERE'S INTERACTIVE DISPLAYS THAT COULD EARLY BE STAGED IN THAT PROCESS EVEN AS EARLY AS SOME OF THE SCREENING PROCESS FOR THAT GROUP. TO GO THROUGH SO THE EXPERIENCES IS A A A GOOD ONE FOR THEM. AND THAT WOULD FREE UP SOME TRAFFIC IT SOME OF THE OTHER WORKADAY. ENTRANCES. ALSO THOUGH IN THIS IN THIS ANALYSIS WE LOOKED IT SQUARE FOOTAGE WITHIN THE ANNEX FOR WIDER CIRCULATION AREAS. PACIFIC WE AREAS WHERE LAWMAKERS CAN MEET WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS WE WANT WE WANT TO HAVE THOSE THAT THE APPROPRIATE SQUARE FOOTAGE. IN THE CIRCULATION SYSTEM SO THAT PUBLIC ACCESS IS GRANTED. OUR BUDGET COST BUDGET CONSTRUCTION COST FOR PUBLIC ACCESS VISITORS CENTER. IS APPROXIMATELY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. DANIEL WILL TALK NEXT. ABOUT DESIGN GOALS ITS ALTERNATE OVER TO HER. THANK YOU MARK. THE NINETEEN DESIGN GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES THIRTY EIGHT TO SIXTY FOUR IN YOUR BOOKS. LEAST GOALS FOR RETIREMENT TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT IDEAS OF THE PROJECT. I WILL PROVIDE THE FUTURE DESIGN TEAM WITH GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT THE DESIGN PROCESS. THE GOALS EMERGED FROM STAKEHOLDER WORK SESSIONS AND INTERVIEWS THAT JOHN MENTIONED EARLIER. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN THROUGH THESE DESIGN GOALS SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN COME BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THEM. THE FIRST DESIGN GOAL IS TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS. MAINTAINING TRANSPARENCY AND OPENNESS IS IMPORTANT. OVER TIME WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE NUMEROUS STATE GOVERNMENTS AN OPTION IN OPERATION. BUT MOST ARE NOT AS ENGAGING AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE INTENT OF THE NEW DESIGN IS TO ENHANCE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS. AND REMOTE ACCESS TO MEMBERS BY REORGANIZING THE OFFICES AND CONFERENCE ROOMS AND PROVIDING CLEAR PATHWAYS AROUND THE BUILDING. CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC FEEL COMFORTABLE WHEN VISITING THE CAPITOL AND PARTICIPATING IN THE GOVERNMENTAL PROCESS. SOME EXISTING PHYSICAL BARRIERS HINDER THIS ENGAGEMENT SUCH AS INADEQUATELY SIZE CONFERENCE ROOMS. THE NEW DESIGN TO PROVIDE INVITING SPACES TO PARTICIPATING GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS AND SHOWCASE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. DIGNITY. DIGNITY AND GOVERNMENT FOSTERS PRIDE IN CALL TRY DANITY. EVERYONE WHO WORKS AND AND VISITS CAPITAL SHOULD FEEL A SENSE OF DIGNITY DIGNITY AND PRIDE FROM THE TIME THEY ENTERED THE BUILDING UNTIL THE EXIT THE CAPITOL GROUNDS. THE ANNEX DESIGN CHAU PROVIDE A QUALITY EXPERIENCE FOR ALL USERS BY INSTILLING DIGNITY AND PRIDE. AS WELL AS BY PROVIDING A CONNECTION TO CALIFORNIA'S CULTURE AND HISTORY. ENTRY IN THE VISITOR EXPERIENCE. AS YOU ALTHOUGH THE CAPITAL HOSTS APPROXIMATELY ONE AND A HALF TO TWO MILLION VISITORS A YEAR. INCLUDING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN. THIS LEADS TO VERY CONGESTED ENTRYWAYS AND HALLWAYS AT THE COUNTY DISPLAYS WHICH WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED. THE NEW DESIGN WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEDICATE AN AREA FOR GUESTS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN TOGETHER FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE. THIS DEDICATED AREA SHOULD ENGAGE THE GUESTS WITH INTERACTIVE DISPLAYS AND BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE LARGE CROWDS. THERE SHOULD ALSO BE CLEAR DIRECT ROUTES FOR THOSE WISHING TO DO BUSINESS WITH IN THE CAPITAL. FUNCTIONALITY. A FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WILL ENABLE USERS TO EFFICIENTLY A COMFORTABLY CARRY OUT THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. IS NOT PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE TO RENOVATE THE CURRENT BUILDING TO FUNCTION AS DESIRED DO ITS SIZE AND STRUCTURAL CONFIGURATION. FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR INTERVIEWS WITH USERS THAT MANY CONVERSATIONS OCCUR IN THE CORRIDORS. LACK TO. DUE TO LACK OF INADEQUATE MEETING SPACES. IT COMPOUNDS THE CONGESTION IN THE HALLWAYS. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOULD HOUSE ALL DESIRED FUNCTIONS INCLUDING THESE CASUAL CONVERSATION SPOTS IN THE CORRIDORS. THE NEXT GOAL IS HIERARCHY. HIGHER KEY OF SIGNS ACCORDANCE TO AREAS OF BUILDING THROUGH SHEEP SIZE LOCATION AND LEVEL OF FINISH. PRINCIPLES OF HIGHER KEY EVIDENT IN THE HISTORIC CAPITAL SHALL BE CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE NEW DESIGN OF THE AND. CURRENTLY AS YOU MOVE BETWEEN THE TWO BUILDINGS. EVIDENT THAT THE ANNEX WHO WAS NOT COORDINATED ALL ON THE DESIGN WITH THE HISTORIC CAPITAL. HISTORIC CONNECTION AND RELEVANCY. CURRENTLY THERE'S VERY LITTLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HISTORIC CAPITAL IN THE ANNEX. THE MISALIGNMENT OF THE FLOORS IS MARK DISCUSSED. AND THE SEMI INSTITUTIONAL FINISHES OF THE ANNEX GIVE IT OF DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT FEEL. THE GOAL OF THE ANNEX DESIGN SHOULD BE TO STRENGTHEN THE CONNECTION. BETWEEN AN ACCENT HISTORY CAPITAL WITHOUT OVERSHADOWING THE STORK RELEVANCY OF THE CAPITAL. THIS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED BY INTRODUCING SIMILAR MATERIALS AND SYMBOLISM THAT IS CURRENTLY FOUND THROUGHOUT THIS STORY CAPITOL. ONE OF THE SYMBOLS IS THE CARVED WOULD BEAR THAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE HERE. NEXT SLIDE. NATURAL LIGHTEN VIEWS WE HEARD FROM ALMOST EVERY STAKEHOLDER THAT NATURAL LIGHTING VIEWS ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE DESIGN OF THE ANNEX. THE NEW DESIGN CHAU USE NATURAL LIGHT THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING TOMORROW HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THE USE OF NATURAL LIGHT ALSO REDUCES THE NEED FOR ARTIFICIAL LIGHT. REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND COSTS. LIFE SAFETY. AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED THE ANNEX DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CURRENT BUILDING CODES. IN PARTICULAR. IT'S LACKING A FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM AND HAS INSUFFICIENT EXITING OUT OF THE BUILDING. FIRST BANQUET SYSTEM SAVE BOTH AYE BUILDING OCCUPANTS AND FIREFIGHTERS LIVES. THEY CAN ALSO LIMIT DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS STRUCTURES DURING A FIRE. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO MEET OR EXCEED ALL BUILDING CODES. IT WILL PROVIDE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL USERS INCLUDING THOSE WORKING IN THE BUILDING. TWO GROUPS VISITORS AND SCHOOL CHILDREN. ACCESSIBILITY. ACCESSIBILITY MEANS PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL USERS REGARDLESS OF ABILITY. SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE AMERICAN WITH DISABILITIES ACT EIGHTY A. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE BILLING HAS UNDERGONE NUMEROUS RENOVATIONS TO IMPROVE ACCESSIBILITY. HOWEVER IT IS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE BROUGHT FULLY AT TO THE ADA IN CALIFORNIA TITLE TWENTY FOUR STANDARDS. AS THE LAW REQUIRES DUE TO MANY BARRIERS WITHIN THE BUILDING. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGNED SHOULD BE FULLY ACCESSIBLE AND PROMOTE THAT SEAMLESS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ACCESS SHOW WE WERE PROVIDED TO ALL PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS. ACCESSIBLE DESIGN SHOW EXTEND TO ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUILDING INCLUDING STAIRS. RAMPS DOOR HARDWARE SEATING SIGNAGE PLUMBING FIXTURES ELEVATORS AND MUCH MORE. THE LIFT THAT SEEN IN THIS PICTURE HERE'S ONE OF THOSE THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO GET RID OF. AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL THAT IS NOT OUT OF THE WAY AND INCONVENIENT AS THIS WITH CURRENTLY IS. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN. IT IS BEEN STATED THAT THE ANNEX SHOW SET AN EXAMPLE FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND BE AMONGST THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT CAPITALS IN THE UNITED STATES. SUSTAINABLE DESIGN NOT ONLY REFERS TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY BUT ALSO EXTENDS TO BUILDING MATERIALS DELIGHT WASTE THE BUILDING SITE. TECHNOLOGY AND ALL OTHER BUILDING SYSTEMS. THE GOAL WOULD BE A MINIMUM OF A LEAD SILVER CERTIFICATION ON THE BUILDING. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHOW ALSO INVESTIGATE HIM IMPLEMENT. AS IN MANY SUSTAINABLE DESIGN MEASURES AS FEASIBLY POSSIBLE. INCLUDING EXPLORING THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY CONSUMPTION. SYSTEM SUCH AS SOLAR PANELS. SAFETY OF USERS. MAINTAINING THE SAFETY AND SECURITY OF BUILDING USERS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. EVERYTHING FROM BUILDING ACCESS AND EXITING TO PARKING A FIRE SPRINKLER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE NEW DESIGN. OVER TIME THE BILLING HAS HAD TO ADAPT TO MORE STRINGENT SECURITY MEASURES SUCH AS THE SECURITY PAVILION SEEN HERE. IN THE PHOTO. THE NEW AN ACTUAL BE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE CURRENT SECURITY MEASURES WITHIN THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING HAVE BE FLEXIBLE TO ACCOMMODATE FUTURE MEASURES. WHY ME? SURE ON. THERE'S A NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE. NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES. THAT. IN SEPTEMBER. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ARE LIKE THREE WEEKS MORE OPEN THE DEPUTY US MARSHAL GAVE ME A TOUR OF THIS NEW. NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE. AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS HE SAID. THAT. HE WAS IN THE ROOM ON BEHALF OF THE U. S. MARSHALL LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON THAT DAY EVERYONE FIRST FILED IN THE ROOM. TO START A CONVERSATION OR NEW COURTHOUSE. AND SO HE HE JUST EXPRESS THIS IDEA THAT. IF YOU GET YOUR SECURITY TEAM IN THE CONVERSATION EARLY. THEN YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE A. EIGHT. REAL STRONG THREE SIXTY VIEW OF. HOW TO MAKE THE SECURITY THING WORK SECURELY? AND YOU CAN INTEGRATED IN THE% DESIGN AND THAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY TO GO. SO THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR WE HAD OUR. DENNIS CAPTAINCIES PR OWN SERGEANTS IN THE CONVERSATION. SO THIS BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT THING TO DO EARLY BECAUSE IS SO SO NEEDED TODAY AND IT BECOMES MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO START TO COME. GREAT THINK YOU AND THAT'S REALLY INDICATIVE OF THE ENTIRE PROCESS WE WOULD WANNA BRING IN. ALL DIFFERENT. ENTITIES SUCH AS SECURITY ACCESSIBILITY AND THE DIFFERENT. PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON THE DESIGN OF THE PROCESS EARLY TO HAVE BEEN A SUCCESSFUL DESIGN. MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS IS THE NEXT DESIGN GOAL. AS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE CURRENT MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WITHIN THE ANNEX OR INEFFICIENT AND INADEQUATE FOR THE CURRENT BUILDING NEEDS. NEW MECHANICAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT ONLY GOOD FOR THE BILLING USERS ARE ALSO GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE POTENTIALLY HARMFUL EQUIPMENT FROM THE BUILDING AND PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART LOW IMPACT EQUIPMENT. THE NEW AN EXTRA HAVE MODERN ELECTRICAL MECHANICAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE ENERGY EFFICIENT. USE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF FRESH AIR HAVE USER FRIENDLY CONTROLS AND ARE ADAPTABLE TO FUTURE NEEDS. TECHNOLOGY. WHEN UNIX WAS CONSTRUCTED THE DESIGNERS COULD NOT SEE OR PREDICT THE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY AND THE LIFE. OUR LIFETIME WOULD SEE OVER TIME TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE BUILDING. BUT IT'S STILL NOT UP TO MODERN STANDARDS. RESIDING IN THE TECH CAPITOL OF THE WORLD WILL PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAP INTO THIS KNOWLEDGE. AND APPLY IT TO FUTURE DESIGN. THE NEW HEADACHES SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO ALL SPACES THEY'RE FLEXIBLE DEDICATED PATHWAYS. ALLOWING FOR EASY UPGRADES IN THE FUTURE. A DECENT SEIZE. AND THIS IS THE CHART THAT WAS REFERRED TO. BACK THERE ON THE BOARD. THE FUTURE ANNEXES NINE SHOW CONSIDER THE NEEDS OF ALL DEPARTMENTS AND FUNCTIONS TO PROVIDE A MORE EFFICIENTLY OUT EVERY USERS. AND MAKE NAVIGATION THROUGH THE BUILDING MORE INTUITIVE FOR VISITORS. THE CALIFORNIA CAPITAL IS UNIQUE IN ITS CURRENT DESIGN AND THAT THE HISTORIC CAPITOL BUILDING WAS EXPANDED UPON IS THE STATE GREW RATHER THAN. BUILDING A SECOND OFFICE BUILDING. THIS ALLOWS ALL ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER AND HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE CHAMBERS AND OTHER CEREMONIAL ROOMS WITHIN THE HISTORY CAPITAL. UNFORTUNATELY THE BUILDING HAS ONCE AGAIN BECOME TOO SMALL TO HOUSE ALL DESIRED FUNCTION. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH USERS. IT IS DESIRED TO MAINTAIN THIS WORKING ADJACENCY. PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH USERS THERE IS A DESIRE TO CONSOLIDATE GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS INTO THE ANTICS. THIS WILL EVERYONE TO HAVE A PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING AND REDUCE TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USE. MEETING SPACES. CURRENTLY MEETING SPACES ARE OFTEN OVERCROWDED. THE BUILDING ALSO LACKS ENOUGH VARYING SIZES A MEETING SPACES INCLUDING INFORMAL CONFERENCE SPACES. UPGRADES TO EXISTING MEETING SPACES AND THE ADDITION OF NEW MEANING SPACES WITHIN THE CURRENT ANNEX BUILDING HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE EXISTING STRUCTURE COLUMN LAYOUT. WHICH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO CREATING LARGE OPEN SPACES. THE NEW DESIGNS OFFER A VARIETY OF MEETING SPACE TYPES AND INCORPORATE MODERN TECHNOLOGY. DISPLAYS. CURRENTLY VISITOR DISPLAYS ARE SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING WITH NO DEDICATED CENTERED OR ANTI ONESELF. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN SHALL STRIVE TO INCORPORATE ENRICHED VISITORS PLAYS TO PROMOTE LEARNING. ABOUT THE STATE AND GOVERNMENT. THE ANNEX DESIGN SHOW ALSO CREATE PATHWAYS FOR THOSE WANTING TO EXPERIENCE THE HISTORY OF THE CAPITOL. AND THOSE WANTING TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITHIN THE CAPITAL TO ALLEVIATE CONGESTION AND CONFUSION. THE LAST GOAL IS CAPITAL PARK AND VIEWS TO THE CAPITAL. THE NEW ANNEX DESIGN CHAU REINFORCED THE HISTORIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SURROUNDING CAPITOL PARK. RATHER THAN DETRACT FROM IT. THE NEW DESIGN CHILL STRIVE TO MAINTAIN VIEWS TO THE HISTORIC CAPITAL. AND PROTECT MEMORIALS WITHIN THE PARK. ANY ADDED STRUCTURES MUST BE SUBSERVIENT TO THIS STORY CAPITAL. TO MAINTAIN THE STATURE IN BEAUTY OF THE GRAND BUILDING AND SURROUNDING PARK. NOW I THINK WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO PROGRAMMING IN WHICH JOHN WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THAT PROCESS. WELL DEFINED WHAT PROGRAMMING MEANS. BECAUSE PROGRAMMING IS A WORD USED BY ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF INDUSTRIES AND. THE A INDUSTRY. PROGRAMMING IS ESSENTIALLY AND EVALUATION OF THE SPACE NEEDS. WITHIN A STRUCTURE. AND THE ADJACENCY IS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE SPACE MEANS. UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF THE ANNEX USERS. YEAH AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY WORK WITH IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IS PART OF THE PROGRAMMING PROCESS. THE. ONCE AGAIN THE. DIAGRAM THE SHOWN BACK THERE AS WELL AS ONE DANIEL MENTION IS ONE OF THE END RESULTS OF THAT. THE PROCESS ITSELF NEEDS TO RESOLVE WHO NEEDS TO BE IN THE BUILDING. AND SHOULD BE IN THE BUILDING AND WHO DOESN'T NEED TO BE IN THE BUILDING AND WHO DOESN'T NEED TO BE IN THE BUILDING. OR DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN ITALY. WE WE. SIX OR THE PROGRAMMING TO FIND OUT HOW MANY SQUARE FEET THE ACTUAL BUILDING. WOULD NEED TO INCORPORATE TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE. FUTURE OF THE PROJECT IN THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THE PROJECT AND LOOKING AT THIS WE'RE TRYING TO BE. A LITTLE BIT MORE. INTO THE FUTURE NOT JUST IN WHAT DO YOU NEED TODAY WHAT WOULD YOU NEED THE FUTURE. SLIDE. SO. ON THIS SIDE HERE WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS. KIND OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE KIND OF PROGRAMMING. THAT. WE PROVIDED. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WAS A HEAVY CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD WITH EVERYBODY ABOUT HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO. ENGAGE THE PUBLIC TO GO TO WHAT SOME OF WHAT DANIEL MENTIONED THAT SOME OF WHAT MARK TALKED ABOUT AS. DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE BUILDING THERE NEEDED TO BE MORE CLEAR AND SPACIOUS AREA FOR THE PUBLIC TO COME INTO THE BUILDING. TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE THEIR. USE OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT. BEING DETRIMENTAL TO THE REST OF THE FUNCTIONS IN THERE SO THE WAS A HIGHLIGHTED IMPORTANCE. TO GET. PUBLISHED USER AND PUT ON HOW THEY USE BUILDING AND HOW THEY'D LIKE TO USE THE BUILDING AND STATE OF JUST. HAVING US TELL THEM HOW THEY GET TO USE THE BUILDING. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SPACES WERE PART OF THE PROGRAMMING EXERCISE WE EVALUATED HOW BIG A SPACES AND HOW MANY SPACES WERE NEEDED. AND A LOT OF THAT WAS IN THE WAYS OF MEETING SPACES. I HEARING SPACES AND OTHER. AMENITIES THAT ALLOWED PEOPLE TO ENGAGE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS JUST VISIT AND HAVE A GOOD TIME IN YOUR BUILDING. BETTER PUBLIC WAITING SPACES. WAS HIGHLY. SOUGHT DURING THE INTERVIEWS AND SO SPACES NEED TO BE. CONFIGURED IN SUCH A WAY WHERE THE PUBLIC IS NO LONGER. REQUIRED TO SIT ON BENCHES OUT THE QUARTERS. WHICH. BOTH INHIBITS EXITING AS WELL AS DOES NOT ACTUALLY PROVIDE COMFORTABLE. AWAITING ENVIRONMENT. WE WE WOULD THINK THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR LOUNGES EVER SPACES WHERE PEOPLE COULD WATCH THAT. LEGISLATURE IN ACTION THAT COULD ALSO FUNCTIONS SOME OF THESE PUBLIC WAITING SPACES. CREATING AN ADDITIONAL HEARING ROOMS OF VARYING SIZES. PROVIDE THE PUBLIC WITH GREATER ACCESS AND ENGAGEMENT. THE BUSINESS OF THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S HIGHLY DESIRED. WE'VE ADDED IN THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAMS WERE FOOTAGE. THESE ASPECTS INTO THE PROJECT WHICH ACTUALLY. IN MOST WAYS BROUGHT ALMOST ALL THE HEARING SPACES BACK INTO THE CAPITAL UNICODE SOLID DATED SPECIFIC LOCATION ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GO FROM ONE HEARING TO ANOTHER HEARING. EITHER AS A. REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GOVERNMENT OR THE PUBLIC TRYING TO ATTEND MULTIPLE HEARINGS WITHOUT HAVING TO TRAVERSE THE LAWNS ARE YARDS OUTSIDE. MORE COMMON USE AREA. WITH A. PLANNING STUDY IDENTIFIED. INEFFICIENT AND. ESSENTIALLY A VERY LOW NUMBER OF PUBLIC UTILITIES THAT WERE AVAILABLE. THERE'S NO. I GUESS WAS NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF TOILET ROOMS YOU CAN PUT INTO THE BUILDING OTHER THAN YOU CAN'T BE LESS THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER AND YOU GUYS ARE WELL BELOW THE THE LOWEST NUMBER FOR AYE TOILET FACILITIES WITHIN THE BUILDING YOU COULD ADD MORE AND WHAT WE WOULD SUGGEST IS THAT. THROUGH THE PROGRAMMING WHAT WE DECIDED WAS THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF HEARING SPACES YOU'LL HAVE. A CONSOLIDATED AREA OF TOILET FACILITIES AVAILABLE FOR THOSE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF USERS THAT WOULD BE THERE. BUT THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE BUILDING YOU WOULD HAVE APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF TOILET FACILITIES KNOWS ARE ALL IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE PROGRAM AS FAR AS NUMBERS GO. CONFERENCE ROOMS WORKROOMS EXIT STAIRS ELEVATORS ALL OF THOSE WHICH FALL WITHIN THE NORMAL EVERYDAY ACCESS POWS. WERE. SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS. IN THIS EXISTING BUILDING AS BEING AN ADEQUATE. AND IN PROGRAMMING THOSE NUMBERS WERE GROSSED OUT TO ALLOW FOR. BETTER. DISBURSEMENT THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND I'LL OF PEOPLE. I GUESS BETTER ACCESS TO THOSE. CONSISTENCY OF SPACE PLANNING AYE AND DESIGN WAS ONE OF THE DESIRES BY MOST OF THE PEOPLE WE TALKED TO. THERE'S TOO MANY INCONSISTENT SPACES. AND IT'S DIFFICULT FROM OFFICE TO OFFICE TO KNOW HOW. HOW THOSE WHO ARE CONFIGURED? AND SO SOME CONSISTENCY WITHIN OUR MODEL WE. IDENTIFIED A CERTAIN SIZE OF SPACE FOR A TYPICAL OFFICE A TYPICAL FUNCTION A TO. A TYPICAL. MEMBERS OPPOSITE. OFFICE SUITE. AND SO ON. WAS ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE SPACE PROGRAM. AND CLEAR ACCESS PATHWAYS WE. GROSSED UP THE NUMBERS TO ALLOW FOR THE CONGESTION IS IT'S. CIRCULATION AND CERTAIN AREAS WITHIN THE BUILDING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS EASIER TO GET AROUND. WAS SAFE FOR FIRE. PROTECTION PERSONNEL. AT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THEY THERE IS A. SERIES OF NOTES SAYING THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER PEOPLE SPREAD OUT THROUGH THE QUARTERS IT'S A LOT HARDER FOR PEOPLE TO GATHER THEM TOGETHER IN A. I EMERGENCY SITUATION. IN CONCLUSION. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND NOW THE REASON YOU'RE SAYING TO IS BECAUSE I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PROGRAMMATIC KLAY. PROGRAMMATIC LEE WE THINK THAT THE. WE NEED TO PROVIDE GREATER PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND MEETING SPACES. THROUGHOUT FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS AND NEEDED BY THE USERS WITHIN THE BUILDING INCREASING THE AREA OF THE CAPITAL ANNEX BUILDING. ULTIMATELY THE OF THE PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATION WE STATED ALREADY STATED THAT ITS JUST NOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE PERIOD AFTER THE SENTENCING NEED MORE SQUARE FOOTAGE WITHIN THE BUILDING. SO THE REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT OF THE EXISTING CAPITAL ANNEX. AND CONSTRUCTING A NEW APPROPRIATELY SIZED ENERGY EFFICIENT. AND I WOULD ADD IN HERE ALSO CODE COMPLIANT ACCESSIBLE. CAPITOL ANNEX BUILDING IN THE SAME LOCATION. BRINGS US TO THE AND OF OUR. PRESENTATION AND WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS. SENATOR LEYVA. GOOD MORNING I STEPPED OUT FROM AND I APOLOGIZE BUT OPPOSITE THIS IS BEEN ADDRESSED PLEASE TELL ME TO STOP TALKING. IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO. CREATING ADDITIONAL CHILDCARE SPACE. I KNOW WE HAVE WE OFFER CHILDCARE HERE AT THE CAPITOL BUT IT'S. WOEFULLY INADEQUATE FOR AS MANY PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE IS THERE ANY THOUGHT TO THAT. I SPECIFICALLY OUT GIVEN. SPECIFICALLY WE DID LOOK AT THAT AND THAT IS PART OF THE NUMBERS WITHIN THE. PROGRAM WHY DON'T KNOW RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IF WE EXPANDED THAT ARE CONTRACTED OUT OR OF WHAT THAT WAS BUT. OURS WAS AN INITIAL PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE WE KIND OF UNDERSTOOD HOW BIG THE BUILDING ONCE I THERE'S A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY WITHIN OF ALL THIS WILL. PLAY OUT AND SO IT EASILY COULD BE PART OF THE PROCESS OKAY GREAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I'D LIKE TO PUT IN A PLUG FOR ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE. DULY NOTED I THINK HE TALKED AND AND ONE OTHER QUESTION I GUESS I KNOW HOW TO OF FREEZE IT NOW MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO PUT IN A PLUG. WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE STARTING MEMBERS AND STAFF WHO ARE STARTING TO BIKE TO WORK. IF NEED BE WHEN WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE NEW GARAGE THERE'S A PLACE IN THE GARAGE. FOR LOCKERS MAYBE EVEN A COUPLE SHOWER STALL SO PEOPLE COULD BIKE TO WORK TAKE A QUICK SHOWER. REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT KEEP EVERYBODY ACTIVE AND HEALTHY. JUST ANOTHER SUGGESTION WELL I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD FIT WITHIN THE SUSTAINABLE DESIGN PRINCIPLES. IT IS EXPECTED THAT. ANYTHING WE DO WILL. PURSUE. APPROPRIATE LEAD CERTIFICATION COMPLY WITH GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVES AT A MINIMUM. AND. SO BY KEENAN ALL MANNER OF THINGS LIKE THAT I THINK WOULD BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. I I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GIVEN GREAT. IF I MAY I HAVE MORE ON THAT ONE FOR YOU A WAS ACTUALLY INCLUDED WITHIN THAT. PARKING. STRUCTURE ALREADY. BECAUSE IT WAS A FAIRLY STRONG TOPIC WHERE EVERYBODY SAID HEY EVERYBODY'S RIDE THEIR BIKES OR GLORIA FOR BIKES AND SO. I THINK YOU'RE ECHOED BY MANY PEOPLE WE TALKED TO. IF I MAY TURN OUT TO CENTER MOROCCAN AND TO YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHURN. I'M JUST CURIOUS. I KNOW YOU'VE HAD A FUN TIME REVIEWING THE ANNEX. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY. THE DESIGN WHO WAS SORT OF AWKWARD DID YOU GET ASSEMBLYMEMBERS IN THE BASEMENT DOOR. AND YOU KNOW WE GOT OFFICES NEXT ELEVATOR DOORS. DID DID YOU EVER FIND OUT. WHY IT WASN'T? NUMBER. BUT WE DO YOU CAN YOU DIG INTO THE RHYME OR REASON FOR SOME OF THE DESIGN FEATURES. WE DID ACTUALLY LOOK AT ALL. KIND OF HISTORIC DOCUMENTS AND THE COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THE SIXTIES. HONESTLY. WHAT WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT AS YOU GUYS GREW YOU RAN OUT OF SPACE AND PEOPLE JUST TOOK WHATEVER SPACE I COULD POSSIBLY DO AND IT'S MOVED? SHIFTED MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY OF BEING HERE IT WAS NOT I DON'T THINK. INTENDED TO HAVE SOME OF THE SPACE IS OCCUPIED AS OFFICE SPACES BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE. DREADFUL OFFICE SPACES AND QUITE HONESTLY I DON'T BELIEVE MOST OF THOSE ACTION COMPLY WITH. BUILDING CODES. OKAY AT LEAST NOT TODAY'S BUILDING CODES AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MAY NOT HAVE COMPLIED WITH BUILDING BECAUSE OF THAT SPECIFIC POINT TIME. BUT YOU YOU HAVE. I'D. QUOTE UNQUOTE. THE BUILDING IS A STRAIGHT JACKET FOR EXPANSION AND. WITH THAT THAT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE TO KIND OF FIT WHATEVER YOU CAN WITHIN THE TIGHT ENVELOPE THAT YOU HAVE AND SO. WE CAN IDENTIFY Y. ALTERNATELY PUT ON THERE BUT WE KNOW THAT IT WAS BECAUSE YOU JUST HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO PUT THEM. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS EVER THE INTENTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE STRUCTURAL STEEL PROCUREMENT LAW. CALIFORNIA. I DON'T KNOW THAT ONE OKAY. FREE YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK INTO THAT IT'S BEEN KIND OF AN AWKWARD DILEMMA FOR PROJECTS. ESPECIALLY CALTRANS AND I JUST WANNA KNOW IF IT'S. ALSO. PERTINENT TO THIS CERTAIN*. LIKE IS NOT GETTING EMAILS FROM. VENDORS THAT HURDLE FRUSTRATED. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TIMING AND THIS IS MAYBE A MULTI. LONG QUESTION BUT. WHO WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD? IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE TERMINAL C. TO THE JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT. WE BUILT IT STARTING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE WERE IN A RECESSION WE WERE ABLE TO GET. GREAT BIDS YOU NO ASSEMBLY A CONSTRUCTION COSTS WERE LOWER BECAUSE THERE WAS JUST NOT A LOT OF. GOING ON I WAS TELLING MATURE THAT I WOULD TO WERE. THE CONSTRUCTION EVERY SIX WEEKS BUT THE HARD HAT ON THE. HARD SHOWS YOU KNOW TO. THE CHOOSE. IN THE END THE EMILY EMPLOYEES WHICH ARE PART OF JUST THANKS FOR HELPING US SO WE WE BUILT THAT WAY UNDER BUDGET. AND SO WE HAVE THESE ECONOMIC CYCLES ITS OATH STATE IS ISSUING BONDS AND EVERYBODY'S BUILDING NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND. ALL THIS ACTIVITIES GOING ON WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COMPETE MAYBE PAY MORE WAIT LONGER. AND AND I'M JUST CURIOUS I KNOW YOU DON'T SEE THE FUTURE BUT HOW DO WE. HOW DO WE TIME IT WERE AT THE OTHER DAY WAS A POINTED WE BUILD THIS? AT THE RIGHT TIME IS WE. COMMUNICATE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING. I THINK THIS VERY QUESTION. WHEN WE DID OUR ANALYSIS FOR. ARC ARE COSTING WHAT WE DID IS WE TOOK INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR WHAT ESCALATION IS ACROSS THE TEN YEAR PERIOD AND WE TALK AND EVALUATION OF. A WHOLE LOT OF YOUR CAPITOL BUILDING OUR ERA COURTHOUSE BUILDINGS I GOT BUILT OVER THAT AMOUNT OF TIME WE DIDN'T EVALUATION ON THAT AND. WHAT IT SHOWED TO US IS THAT YEARS AGO THERE WAS? LESS ESCALATION THEN THERE IS YOUR CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING BUT OVERALL THAT ESCALATION WAS TWO POINT FIVE. I THINK TODAY AND TODAY'S WORLD IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN ALL OTHER TIMES THAT WE'VE HAD A SOURCE CONSTRUCTIONS CON BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL TO TELL US WILL THAT CONTINUE. WE DO KNOW THAT WITH. WITH THIS KIND OF PROJECTS TO BANG AND HOW YOU APPROACH THEM. AS YOU PROCEED TO END OF THE DESIGN CYCLE THE DESIGN CYCLING SELF WILL PROBABLY TAKE. JUST TO GARNER ENOUGH AGREEMENT FROM EVERYBODY THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN DESIGN CYCLE PROBABLY TWO YEARS AND MAYBE TWO AND A HALF YEARS JUST TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE YOU ACTUALLY READY. TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THERE'S LOTS OF OTHER LOGISTICS HAVE TWO ONE THREE THAT PROCESS OF SUCH AS WHERE IS EVERYBODY MOVING TO. AND. EVERYTHING ELSE. THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF TELECOMMUNICATION ISSUES THAT COME UP THAT HOW DO YOU REMOTE THOSE TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN ALL THE SINK SO THERE'S A LOT OF THE JUST SIX THE HASTERT HAPPEN BEFORE YOU CAN ACTUALLY. PUT A SPADE IN THE GROUND. ONCE THAT'S ALL DONE THE CONSTRUCTION ITSELF WILL PROBABLY TAKE ABOUT. THREE YEARS JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO IT. APPROPRIATELY A COULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER BUT I. I CAN'T BELIEVE IN TODAY'S SOCIETY WE CAN BUILD THIS BUILDING IN THREE YEARS. WITH THAT THOUGH. DEPEND WHAT YOU'RE TRENDS ARE IF YOU DO DECIDE AT THIS POINT TIME OUR ACROSS THE STATE TO. YOU'VE ALREADY DONE A LOT OF THE. THE COURTHOUSE PROJECTS WHICH WAS A SIGNIFICANT. INSTRUCTION EFFORT BUT IF YOU DO REBUILD A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUR EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION ARE YOU HAVE LARGE. DANCES OF CONSTRUCTION THAT GO ON THAT WILL MODIFY POTENTIALLY THE AVAILABILITY OF. LABOR TO WORK ON THE BUILDING. AND YOU WILL WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU ACTUALLY MODERATE THEN POTENTIALLY WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO YOU DON'T FORCE ANYTHING TO RAPIDLY THAT CAR COST YOU MORE MONEY AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE GIVING YOU A LITTLE BIT LONGER PERIOD TO WORK THIS OUT SO YOU CAN. SPREAD THAT AND. MAKE SURE YOU FIND THE MANPOWER AVAILABLE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD AS IT MIGHT FALL. BY THE SAME TOKEN IT MIGHT BE. MORE COST EFFECTIVELY DO A QUICKER AND SO THAT THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO A PLACE. SO IF YOU LOOK FORWARD AND YOU CAN FORECAST AT ALL THOSE SCHOOLS WILL BE BUILT HERE BUT WE COULD FIND A WAY TO ACTUALLY GET THIS MOVING FORWARD EARLIER. YOU'RE BUYING A CONTRACT PRIOR TO. ALL THOSE OTHERS IT'S DETRIMENTAL TO YOUR STATE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR THEIR BUILDINGS IF YOU TRY TO BUILD THEM ALL THE SAME TIME. AND I GENERAL CONSTRAINT JUST AN OBSERVATION FOR MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE. WE YOU PROBABLY END UP. TIMING THE PROJECT GENERALLY TO WHEN YOU WOULD KICK IT OFF. AND WOULD BE MOVING BACK AND TO THE FALL OF AN ODD NUMBERED YEAR. SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT OPPORTUNE TO BE ENGAGED IN DESTRUCTION OF OFFICES WITH WHOLESALE MOVES. A HUNDRED TWENTY LAWMAKERS. IN THE FALL DURING IN THE ELECTION CYCLE YEAR. YEAH AND AND THIS IS THIS WAS THE CASE WHEN THEY DID THE WEST WING. YOUR KEY MOVES HAPPEN IN THE FALL YOUR KEY TRANSITION FROM ONE FACILITY TO A NEW FACILITY HAPPEN IN THE FALL OF THAT ODD NUMBERED YEAR. SO I JUST. I SORT OF THINK WE NEED TO. LOOK AT THAT LOOK AT THE STUDIES THAT NEED TO BE DONE THE GROUNDS. THE SWING SPACE AND WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING FOR THE BIG MOVES. THAT NEED TO HAPPEN. TO TRANSITION FROM ONE ESTABLISHED SYSTEM WITH ALL THE PARTS WORKING TO SUPPORT OUR GOVERNMENT'S. TO ANOTHER ESTABLISHED SETTING WITH ALL THE PARTS WERE TO SUPPORT OUR GOVERNANCE. HAS HAPPENED THE FALL OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO YOU THAT THAT'S BECOMES A PRACTICALITY. THAT WE HAVE A WORKING TO THE GOVERNMENT. SUPPORTING THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. AND THE WELCOMING PUBLIC AND WE NEEDED TO HURRY UP TRANSITION FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. TO FACILITATE PROGRESS THAT'S ANOTHER MARKER. THAT'LL AFFECT WHERE WE. WHERE WE ARE THE CYCLE? BUT WE JUST PERFECT I THINK WE JUST WE NEED TO PROCEED WITH ALACRITY AND DO THE PLANNING STUDIES. THERE ARE WAYS TO ENHANCE IT ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID OUR PROCESS WAS ON A WEEKLY BASIS I ASSURANCE. CENTER MORLOCK WE PUT TOGETHER STAFF PHONE CALLS. ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ARCHITECTURAL TEAMS WAS MIDDLE PICK THE BRAIN OF THE TEAM ON THIS AND. TWO SHORT CYCLE THINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT'S SORT OF THINKING WE WANTED TO AGGRESSIVELY ON THE PUBLIC'S BEHALF. AND AND THEN YOU ARE IN CONTROL YOUR SCHEDULE IF YOU'VE DONE YOUR WORK UP FRONT AND YOU CAN PICK THE OPPORTUNE. TIME TO PROCEED EARLIER BAD TURN TO SENATOR MITCHELL YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ONO YOU MUST. TURN TO SENATOR MITCHELL. SENATOR MITCHELL THANK THANK YOU SENATOR MOORE LA. I WOULD FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUES I INQUIRED TO WITH REGARD TO CHILDCARE. AND I HOPE. THAT A PART OF YOUR PLANNING THAT THAT SOME TIME AND EFFORT WILL BE SPENT. IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CURRENT VENDOR THEY'RE DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE CHILD CARE SLOTS. FOR STATE EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATE AREA I KNOW THE FACILITY CLOSE FOR SOMETIME APPEARED OF TIME AND I'M NOT SURE WHY IT IT SEEMS TO US THAT ON THE OUTSIDE LOOKING IN THAT IT'S AN OBVIOUS THAT THERE WOULD BE A DEMAND. I KNOW THEY HAVE A LONG WAY LESS BUT I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT. SOME THOUGHT GO INTO AND AND COLLABORATION DISCUSSION WITH PEOPLE IN THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION PROVISION BUSINESS. TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF CARE WOULD BE. GREATEST UTILIZED BY LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES. YOU KNOW INFANT CARE S. IS ACROSS THE STATE MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND. IF IT'S. SICK CHILD CARE GIVEN THE NATURE OF OUR WORK IF THAT IS IS. IT IN GREATER DEMAND I JUST THINK IF WE'RE GONNA INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION IT SHOULD BE THOUGHTFUL AND STRATEGIC AND REALLY APPLY TO THE ACTUAL NEED. OF STAFF AS OPPOSED TO. THE BUSINESS PLAN YOU WOULD ENGAGE IN TO JUST BUILD A CHILD CARE FACILITY THAT NEEDS GENERAL LICENSING STANDARDS SO MANY IMPRINT ROOMS AT FEDEX THAT ARE. THE W. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. CREATE A DESIGN AND THE PROVISION OF THE KIND OF CARE ON THAT THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF ACTUALLY NEED. IT'S VERY COSTLY LA AND AND I KNOW THAT. BASED ON THE COSTS. CHARGED BY PREVIOUS VENDORS SOMETIMES IT'S BEEN COST PROHIBITIVE BASED ON SALARY LEVELS OF PAVE HERE AT THE BUILDINGS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT TOO. I'M CURIOUS IF ANY OF THE OTHER PROJECTS YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN HAVE INCLUDED CHILDCARE FACILITIES AND WHAT YOUR STRATEGY WAS IN. IN BUILDING IT EXPANDED UPON THEM. YEAH IT'S AN INTERESTING SUBJECT AND I I THINK. MOST OF THE SUBJECTS ASSOCIATED WITH DOING A DESIGNED FOR THIS BUILDING WOULD INCLUDE. A VERY DELIVERED A VERY THOUGHTFUL PROCESS FOR EVERY ASPECT OF INCLUDING JUST EVEN HEARING ROOMS AND MEETING SPACES SO. EACH ONE OF THEM HAS A CERTAIN LEVEL OF I GUESS ON AN EMOTIONAL AND A. I I GUESS A CAREFUL THOUGHT THAT NEEDS TO GO ONTO I'M I THINK. CHILD CARE WE HAVE TALKED. WHEN WE WERE WORKING IN WYOMING WE TALK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THAT IS THEY HAVE THE SAME SIMILAR PROBLEM THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR CHILD CARE. LOCALLY CONVENIENT. GENERALLY SPEAKING THESE TYPES OF BUILDINGS ARE NOT CONDUCIVE CONDUCIVE TO. CHILD CARE AND SO I I GUESS I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT IF IT WAS GOING TO. THE PART OF THE PROJECT FIRST AND WE LOOK AT IS IS THERE A. LOCAL ADJACENT THAT IS EASIER BECAUSE. CHILD CARE HAS VERY SPECIFIC RULES ARE DIFFERENT THAN ON OFFICE BUILDING AND SO THOSE ARE SOME CONSIDERATIONS. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT CAN'T BE DONE WITHIN THE BUILDING NOW. AND SO AND IT'S IT. I I BELIEVE THERE'S ACTUALLY NUMBERS IN THERE RIGHT NOW FOR SOME OF THAT. WE HAVE NOT. THE LIBERTY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AS WE GET TELL YOU GUYS THIS IS WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE. AND YOU GET TO TELL US IN THE FUTURE HOW YOU'D LIKE TO USE THOSE OPTIONS AND I I BELIEVE THAT IT'S. IT IT PERFECTLY COULD FIT WITHIN WHAT WE ARE. TALKING ABOUT AS FAR SQUARE FOOTAGE AND THE. THE THOUGHT PROCESS FOR IT IT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO BE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. OR IT COULD BE HIGHER BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THOSE SPACES WHO ARE NEED TO BE ADJACENT TO THE EXTERIOR EXITING SYSTEMS. AND BECAUSE IT'S A LOT HARDER TO. GET A WHOLE BUNCH OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF THE BUILDING BIG REASONS INCLUDED. THAN IT IS TO GET ADULTS ON THE BILLING SO USUALLY WHAT GOES ON A LOCAL. I KNOW FIRST FOUR KIND OF EXIT STRUCTURE SO I I THINK IT COULD EASILY ADDED AND AND I THINK THAT ALL OF THE SPACES AND ALL THE CONVERSATION WE JUST HAD. FOR REQUIRE EVERYBODY'S. I I I THINK ATTENTION TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE DECISIONS THAT. ARE OUR DECISIONS RESERVE WERE URBAN ECHO OF. WELL YOU GUYS WOULD DESIRE AND SO THAT'S WHY ALL THE WAY THROUGH OUR REPORT WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND IT'S NOT WHAT WE WERE GONNA. TELL YOU HAVE TO DO WILL TELL YOU IF WE THINK THAT YOU HAVE BETTER OPTIONS. OR THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING ABOUT OPTION WHICH. I THINK THOSE ARE OWES OF. ARE JOB BUT WHAT ACTUALLY GOES ON THE BUILDING IS TRULY UP TO YOU GUYS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND AND WITH THAT MISTER CHAIR THAT I WOULD SUGGEST I MEAN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT IN IN. IN TERMS OF OUR OWN EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE OF STAFF CREATES A THIRD HOUSE WE TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN TERMS OF THE VISITING CENTER. THAT IN TERMS OF A CHILD CARE FACILITY THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXTRA ELEMENT OF DUE DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE. ON INCUMBENT UPON US TO ENGAGE IN IN TERMS OF ENGAGING THE ELSEWHERE IN THE BUSINESS OF CONSTRUCTING AND RUNNING CHILDCARE FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT A. AS WELL AS AN ASSESSMENT OF YOU KNOW THE THE GENERAL. OFFERINGS IN THE AREA AND FOR US TO LOOK BACK AT THE HISTORY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS INDEED LEGISLATIVE STAFF. WHO? PREDOMINATELY UTILIZE THE FACILITY IN THE LLB AS OPPOSED OTHER STATE EMPLOYEES I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO SOME HOMEWORK. UM TO FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR EXPERIENCE AS CHILLY BEEN THERE AND TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MAKES SENSE FOR LEGISLATIVE EMPLOYEES TO MAKE AFFORDABLE SO THEY CAN ACCESS IT. EXCEPT US I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THAT RELIGION. WELL AND I THINK THAT FITS WITH THE PROCESS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THE HEARING TO IS REALLY. THE SEQUENCE APPEARANCE WAS TO. LET US ON JOINT RULES WHO HADN'T DEALT WITH A BUILDING IN A GENERATION. START BUILDING THE COMMON FRAMEWORK OF UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS THE ISSUES THAT WAS MISTER HART TALKING ABOUT. OTHER CONSTRUCTIONS OUR OWN GENERAL SERVICES WITH ADJACENT CANDY. OUR STAFF DIANNE BEUERLEIN SO I THINK THAT FITS WITH THE IDEA OF. HOW DO WE BUILD A COMMON FRAMEWORK UNDERSTAND THE CHOICES THE OPTIONS HOW IT FITS IN SPECIALTY RULES OF MAY APPLY? OTHER WOULD ENFORCE A CHOICE WHAT IS CONVENIENT. ETCETERA. SO I THINK THAT JUST BECOMES ANOTHER. ANOTHER STUDY TO SUPPORT. OUR DELIBERATIONS. VERY GOOD. SO AS SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU CAN I HAVE THE FLOOR pWELL CERTAINLY MAKE BETTER THANK. NOT. COM I HAVE A TWO FOLD QUESTION IT'S SORT OF A MARKETING QUESTION AND IT'S A MANAGEMENT QUESTION. I BEEN UP HERE FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS AND I DON'T SEE A C. E. O.. AROUND HERE I DON'T SEE WHO'S. YOU KNOW WHERE THE BUCK STOPS AT THERE'S A PROJECT SO. WHO WE DEAL OR SUFFER FROM PROJECTS THAT DON'T DO WELL? HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT POPULAR IN MY DISTRICT PEOPLE MONNING GROWN AND IT'S ALREADY OVER BUDGET BY BILLIONS. SO THAT'S RIGHT WHO DO YOU BLAME. AND WHO WHO GETS. YOU KNOW THEIR EARS CHEWED OFF. SO. WHEN IT COMES TO REMODELING OR DOING SOME LIKE THIS IT'S ALWAYS LIKE TWO TIMES WOULD. YOU LIKE TO A BATHROOM PROJECT YOUR KITCHEN PROJECT YOU MENTAL DOUBLE THE TIME. AND DOUBLE THE BID IS YOU'RE GONNA GET CHANGE ORDERS AND YOU'RE GONNA GET COST OVERRUNS. AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING HOW TWO WE. HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THE PROJECT AT WHEN YOU SEE IT'S GONNA TAKE THREE YEARS AND IT'S GOING TO COST FIVE HUNDRED? MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS GONNA BE A FUN MARKETING. CONCERN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS MANNERS HOMELESSNESS AND ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES. IF SO HOW DO WE HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET THE YOU KNOW YOU IN THE TEAM ALL THE CONTRACTORS. DO THE JOB ON TIME ON BUDGET. AND IS SIR THE ABILITYFOR THE STATE TO GIVE AN INCENTIVE TO SAY KEEP GET EVERYTHING WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU GET OUT OF BOYS OPPOSE IT JUST TOOK A STICK ALL THE TIME. BUT EVEN WITH THE STICK WERE STUCK GRAY WE DON'T YOU KNOW IF YOU SAY IT'S GOING TO COST. FIFTY MILLION MORE. TEN PERCENT OVER AND IT'S LIKE WHAT WE DO. THOUGHT JUST WONDERING WHO WHO AROUND HERE. IS IN CHARGE BECAUSE WE. MADE TERM ROUTER YOU KNOW WE'RE WORK WE'RE JUST FLUID. BUT I DON'T STE AYE I KNOW THAT THAT MAKES SENSE BUT YOU'VE DONE IT FOR COUPLE OTHER STATES. IT'S A HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT AT THE YUBA DAY WERE ALL HAPPY REZAEI THANK YOU GREAT. WHO WON A RECOMMENDED EVERYBODY ELSE? WELL THAT WOULD BE OUR GOAL. AS I AS I NOTED. EARLY IN MY PRESENTATION THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS. AND. WRANGLING TOGETHER EVERYBODY TO MAKE A DECISION AND AND. BRING TO SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS AND A SPECIFIC DIRECTION VERY POOR. PRIOR TO PROCEEDING WITH THE PROJECT AND. UNDERSTANDING THAT YOUR NAY SAYERS NEED TO BE BROUGHT ALONG AND BOUGHT BROUGHT IN TO THE PROCESS. ARE ARE INCLUSIVE NATURE OF HAVING OUR. WHOLE STUDY DONE WAS TO INCLUDE AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE COULD NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WE KNEW THAT. AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE IT OR NOT LIKE IT BUT WE WANT EVERYBODY INVOLVED BECAUSE WE THINK BY BEING INCLUSIVE. YOU CAN GIVE SOMETHING TO EVERYBODY THAT GIVE SOME ABILITY TO BUY INTO THE PROJECT. DOING THAT HELPS YOU STOP THE DECISION MAKING. AS YOU GOING TO CONSTRUCTION WHAT DAMAGES PROJECTS IS DECISION MAKING AFTER THE FACT. IF YOU CAN COME TO A CONSOLIDATED THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO. AND YOU CAN PROCEED ON A FIT SCHEDULED TO THAT. THEN THE STICK PORTION OF IT WORKS BECAUSE YOU'VE GIVEN THE CONTRACTOR VERY SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS THAT DO THAT. BUT IF YOU SAY DO THIS BUT ALSO IT KINDA DO THIS OR KIND AND YOU THIS WHICH IS A PROBLEM WITH ANY HOME RENOVATION AS YOU MENTIONED. FIXING YOUR BATHROOM FIXING YOUR KITCHEN. I WOULD SAY SO YOU HAVE TO GIVE YIELD SOME AUTHORITY TO SOMEBODY ELSE AND SO MY WIFE IN OUR KITCHEN. NOT ME SO SHE MADE THOSE DECISIONS SOMEBODY HOUSE THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU AGREE ON WHAT IS THE PATH FOR DECISION MAKING. AND WHAT IS THE PATH. FOR CHANGING THOSE DECISIONS BECAUSE AS YOU SAID. YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH AND WHEN WE DID IDEA HOW WE WENT THROUGH. FOR. FOR FIVE LEGISLATIVE BODIES AND FIVE GOVERNOR'S. THERE'S A LOT OF POSSIBILITY. FOR. PROJECT TO GO AWRY DURING ALL THIS CHANGES WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT. YOU'VE ALREADY DONE THE RIGHT THING YOU HAVE. THE JOINT COMMITTEE. THAT CAN MAKE THESE. DECISIONS AND SET THIS UP A PRIORITY FOR. YOU NEED HAVE CONSISTENCY IN THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE ONE PERSON THAT IS EMPLOYED. FOR THE PURPOSES WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT AND IT COULD BE ONE OR TWO OR THREE BUT DO YOU HAVE A HERO THAT YOU DECIDE THIS PERSON IS EMPLOYED AND FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT. THEY CAN REMEMBER AND THIS IS WHY WE ARE TEAM WHO HAS WORKED ON THREECAPITAL PROJECTS IS THE SAME TEAM THAT GOT TOGETHER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. BECAUSE CONSISTENCY OF KNOWLEDGE KEEPS YOU ON TRACK AND IF YOU CHANGE JOBS IF YOU MODIFY IF YOU HAVE. ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING STAFF THE CHANGE THAT ARE IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS THEY FORGET WHY THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY CAN'T REMIND OTHER PEOPLE. WHY THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE I DON'T HAVE OF SILVER BULLET. BUT I DO BELIEVE IF YOU STOP MAKING. DECISIONS AT A POINT IN YOUR ALLOW THE DESIGN TEAM TO FINISH WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND YOU CAN ACCEPT THAT THAT'S A GOOD ENOUGH SOLUTION BECAUSE THIS ISN'T YOUR HOUSE. PEOPLE'S HOUSE EVERYBODY GETS TO USE IT OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. YOU YOU'RE NOT THE. AS AS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND AS THE GOVERNOR YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT HERE FOREVER BUT EVER THE GOVERNMENT HAS AND SO IF WE CAN FOCUS ON. THOSE KIND OF TARGETS OF THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FOREVER. AND WE CAN MAKE THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS I THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY TASK PEOPLE WITH A VERY SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES HE WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE. SHARON AND I ARE YOU WORKING THROUGH DG ES THAT. ARE CURRENTLY WE'RE WORKING THROUGH YOU GUYS JUST THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE YEAH YEAH WELL THE. THE STATUTE PASSED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN PROVIDES THAT WE WILL WORK PRETTY GS. STATES. PURSUANT AN AGREEMENT THE JOINT RULES COMMITTEE SO BY STATUTE THE ANNEX IS THE LEGISLATURE'S BUILDING. THE GOVERNOR HAS THE FIRST FLOOR. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO. FORMULATE THE PLAN THAT WE WANT AND INDEED YES IS OUR PARTNER. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY A D. G. S. HAS BEEN A VERY WILLING AND EAGER PARTNER. HONESTLY THE TWENTY SIXTEEN STATUTE. A. WAS RATHER OPTIMISTIC SAYING THAT THAT JOINT RULES COMMITTEE WOULD PROVIDE DIRECTION BECAUSE AT THAT TIME JOINT WILL SADAT MET AND FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YEARS. SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING. OR THE LAST YEAR TO KIND OF. SYSTEMATIZE A CONVERSATION WITH IN THE LEGISLATURE. SO THAT WE ACTUALLY BECOME A FIT PARTNER A WITH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ON THIS PROJECT. SO IT IS IT IS CONTEMPLATED THAT. WE WOULD TURN TO THEM FOR ALL MANNER OF SUPPORT. BECAUSE OF THEIR SPECIALLY AND AND. THEY'VE BEEN SUPPORTIVE EVE EVEN THE EXTENT OF TRAVEL US TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER CAPITALS AS WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER VERY GOOD. ARM. WELL AT THIS POINT I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS PROJECT. AND. SHE HAS CHANGED YOU WAVE DONE OUTSTANDING WORK FOR US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY. I WANT TO REMIND ANYONE WHO'D BE WATCHING THIS HEARING OF THOSE IN THE AUDIENCE. WE DO HAVE A WEBSITE. THAT IS BEEN UP AND RUNNING SINCE LAST YEAR. IT'S ANNEX DOT ASSEMBLY DOT CA DOT GOV. AND DOT ASSEMBLY GUTSY DOT GOV. A YOU CAN GO THERE YOU'LL FIND A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATION ON THIS PROJECT EIGHT INTO THE WORK OF LAST YEAR. CURACY SPECIFIC LINK ADDED TODAY THE AND EXPLAIN STUDY SO THE FULL STUDY THAT WE'VE SEEN REVIEW OF IS AVAILABLE. ONLINE. I WANT TO SAY IT'S A. IT IS THAT SAME PROCESS AS JOINT RULES CHAIR TO BE. PARTICIPATED IN THEIR HOUSE. AND I WANT TO SHARE. ITS OR HOW YOUR LIFE WORKS OUT. TWO WEEKS. TWO WEEKS BEFORE I WAS EVER ON ELECTED OFFICIALS. BACK AND A TWO THOUSAND THREE. A LETTER SHOWED UP ON MY AT MY HOME. AND WAS ONE OF THOSE LITTLE ENVELOPES OCCULT THE EIGHT TEN SIZE ENVELOPE. AND THIS WAS A LETTER. I I I AM VERY PROUD OF THIS LETTER I KID YOU NOT. ADDRESSED TO MR KEN COOLEY. AND IT WAS FROM U. S. SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY. A LETTER TO MY HOME FROM JUSTICE KENNEDY. FROM HIS PRIVATE OFFICES IN DC. UP I WAS ON THE THRESHOLD OF FOUND IN THE CITY OF RANCHO CORDOVA. AND. HE SAID SUB YOU THE LETTER WHICH WAS DIRECTED TO THAT DATE JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND. THREE BUT REALLY RELATES TO THIS WHOLE BUILDING PROJECT TO ME. HE SAID CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND ALL OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. FOR WORKING TO REINVIGORATE THE PRINCIPLE. OF PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. AND THEN HE SAID. SELF GOVERNMENT MUST NOT BE AN ABSTRACT IDEAL. IT MUST BE A REALITY. AND WE MUST BE UNCEASING. IN OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE AND RESPECTED BY OUR PEOPLE. SO I ACTUALLY FEEL THAT THIS CONVERSATION WE ARE HAVING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ABOUT THIS AND ACTS WHICH HAS BECOME A STRAITJACKET WHICH DOES NOT WELCOME ALL CALIFORNIANS. OUR. THE TO ME I. COMPLETELY SHARE THE CONCERN THAT THIS BE ADMINISTERED IN A SOUND WAY COST EFFECTIVELY. BUT I ALSO FEELS LIKE. THE JUSTIFICATIONS OF WE END UP WITH AN AN EX WHICH IS MORE WELCOMING ALL CALIFORNIANS WHERE THEY HAVE A. MOBILITY ISSUE A HEARING ISSUE OF VISUAL ISSUE WELCOMES THEM ALL HERE. A SAFE AND SECURE SETTING SO THAT. PARENTS WHEN THEY SEND THEIR FOURTH GRADERS TO THE CAPITAL. KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE PERHAPS A LIFE CHANGING SORT OF EXPERIENCE. BY COMING HERE AND SORT OF UNDERSTAND THIS CONNECTION. BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENS IN THE PUBLIC REALM AND THEIR LIFE AND THEIR ABILITY TO ASPIRE TO CHANGE IT. THE OTHER ENVELOPE I KEEP NEXT TO THAT ONCE WHEN I WAS EIGHT I WROTE A LETTER TO JOHN F. KENNEDY. I JUST THINK I WAS A GEEKY LITTLE KID PERSONAL UNDER THE PRESENT I STATES. BUT TO THINK SOMEHOW YOU KNOW YOU COULD EVEN AT THAT STAGE MAKE A CONNECTION. AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COULD BE A PART OF MY LIFE. I FEEL THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IN REPRESENTS. SO ARE I DO WANT TO PLUG THAT WEBSITE BECAUSE OUR VERY FIRST HEARING. WE HEARD FROM THE PROJECT MANAGER THAT'S DONE MANY STATE CAPITALS. AND A CLEAR MESSAGE. WAS THAT WHILE THIS WILL SEEM. NOT SUB IN THE MOST OF US HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AS YOU BEEN INVOLVED A JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT ACTUALLY. OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE NOT TYPICAL FOR ALL OF US. STILL THE PROFESSIONALS TO WORK IN THIS SPACE SAY YOU KNOW. A LOT OF STATES ARE DOING THIS YOU CAN DO IT YOU HAVE OUTSIDE RESOURCES HERE. AND SO I JUST THINK WE NEED TO. YOU KNOW CALM OUR FEARS PROCEED WITH GREAT DILIGENCE. AND A SYMBOL A STRONG TEAM AND JUST MOVE FORWARD A PUBLIC VISION OF WHAT THE BUILDING COULD BE BUT SO WHAT THAT I WOULD JUST A BUT MR VICE CHAIR I THINK YOU'RE. GOOD. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU US MORE LIKE SAVE ME AGAIN PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS REPUBLIC COMET ANYONE WISHING TO MAKE. OFFER OBSERVATIONS TODAY. THE LAPEL PIN IS A BUNDLE OF STICKS. AND. WE SAW THAT SLIDE OF THE DOOR WHICH HAD THE BEARS HAD ON A BUT ON THAT SAID A DOORS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. YOU'D FIND A BUNDLE OF STICKS IT ISN'T ALL THE MONEY MIL STAIRCASES THROUGHOUT THIS BUILDING. SO IT IS PROMINENT IN THE STAIRCASES WHENEVER PEOPLE WOULD WALK UP AND DOWN. THE BUNDLE OF STICKS STANDS FOR OUR SYSTEM OF DEMOCRACY. ARE MISTER MORLOCKS INDIVIDUAL MISTER CANALES INDIVIDUAL I AM INDIVIDUAL. SENATOR MITCHELL LEYVA. MONEY AND WE'RE ALL INDIVIDUALS BOY TAKE THAT OATH OF OFFICE WHICH BINDS US TOGETHER IS STRONG AND FLEXIBLE. GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO ANCIENT ROME WHEN MORE ROMAN MATCH WHICH OCCUR IN THE BUNDLE STICKS. AS OF SOME OTHER OFFICE IT'S ALSO CAST IN THE ART OF EVERY EVERY OLD LAMP IN CAPITAL PARK. IT IN CIRCLES THE LAMP SO WHAT IS THE MOST PROMINENT SYMBOL THAT EARLY CALIFORNIA'S GAPS. LEFT US OF OUR SISTER GOVERNMENT IN THE LAMPS IN THE STAIRCASES IN THE ORIGINAL SECOND FOUR DOORS.
