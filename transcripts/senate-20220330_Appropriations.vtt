00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:52.378
IS RUN EFFECTIVELY- THERE'S ALSO

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:54.413
BIG CONCERNS AROUND THE FACT

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.316

00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:38.323
BE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:40.325

ARE WAITING FOR THEIR MONEY. AND

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.182
WE KNOW THAT THE DELAY IN

00:20:50.248 --> 00:20:51.850
GETTING IT OUT HAS BEEN FOR A

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.819
NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING JUST

00:20:53.885 --> 00:20:55.153
NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.955
KIND OF PROCESS TO THE

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:58.290
APPLICATION SO DOES THIS INCLUDE

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.993
THAT. SO THAT HAS BEEN A PART OF

00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:02.361
THE CONVERSATION AND THE

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:05.063
NEGOTIATION OF THIS BILL WAS THE

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.131
EFFICIENCY OF THE DEPARTMENT

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:08.233
ITSELF. AND WHETHER THERE WAS

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.068
ADEQUATE STAFF WHETHER THE

00:21:10.135 --> 00:21:12.104
POLICY OR THE PROCEDURES AND THE

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.673
PROCESS WAS FLAWED OR IF THERE

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.008
WERE SOME CHALLENGES OR

00:21:16.074 --> 00:21:17.476
OBSTACLES THAT WERE IN THE WAY.

00:21:17.542 --> 00:21:19.111
THOSE THINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:20.846
BY THE ADMINISTRATION BEING THAT

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:23.548
IT'S THE AGENCY AND SO WE

00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:24.716
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM ON

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.119
THAT THIS BILL HAS NOT

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:28.587
ALLOCATED. THAT TO MY KNOWLEDGE

00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:29.988
IN THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.957
STAFF THESE THE MONEY THAT'S AND

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.659
THERE IS FOR THE RENTER AND

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:37.195
LANDLORD. SO WE'RE GIVING. WE'RE

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:41.066
EXTENDING TIME. TO HELP A

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:44.870
PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN SLOW AND

00:21:44.936 --> 00:21:46.972
RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS WITHOUT

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.807
ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT PUTTING

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:52.310
MORE PEOPLE ON BOARD TO HELP.

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:54.713
MANAGE THIS IN A QUICKER MORE

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.750
EFFICIENT WAY. IF I MAY- THE

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:04.756
FLEAS FIND A- WE WOULD ONLY-

00:22:04.823 --> 00:22:07.225
ASSUME BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

00:22:07.292 --> 00:22:09.428
ABOUT PEOPLE AND AN AGENCY- AND

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.163
PEOPLE THAT RUN THE AGENCY AND

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:13.131
PEOPLE ARE IN PERFECT THAT YES

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:14.966
WE WOULD SAFELY ASSUME THAT

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.935
THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS OR THAT

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:19.905
THERE HAVE BEEN- SLOW- ACTIONS

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.840
IN PROCESS HOWEVER I THINK

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:22.908
THERE'S SOMETHING TO ALSO

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:25.310
CONSIDER AND THAT WAS. THE LACK

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:26.978
OF FUNDING THAT WAS COMING IN

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.114
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.916
KNEW THE MONEY WAS COMING BUT IT

00:22:30.982 --> 00:22:32.384
WASN'T LANDING HERE IN

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:34.352
CALIFORNIA QUICK ENOUGH TO BE

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.154
ABLE TO DISPERSE INTO THE HANDS

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.723
OF THOSE THAT WERE IN THE

00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:39.291
PIPELINE HAVING APPROVED

00:22:39.357 --> 00:22:40.726
APPLICATIONS SO WHICH IS WHY

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:42.627
CALIFORNIA IS STEPPING UP TO THE

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.429
PLATE AND MAKING UP THAT

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:46.198
DIFFERENCE RIGHT NOW KNOWING

00:22:46.264 --> 00:22:48.700
THAT. THAT MONEY I'M EMINENTLY

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:49.835
IS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:51.636
GOVERNMENT SO NOW THAT WE HAVE

00:22:51.703 --> 00:22:53.271
STEPPED UP WITH AN APPROPRIATION

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:56.007
WE CAN NOW MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO

00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:57.843
HONOR THOSE CHECKS THAT HAVE

00:22:57.909 --> 00:23:00.512
BEEN APPROVED. AND CAN I ALSO

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.748
JEFF JUST ADD- I KNOW THAT WERE

00:23:02.814 --> 00:23:04.916
ALLOWED TO USE 10215% OF THE

00:23:04.983 --> 00:23:06.852
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ADMINISTRATION

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.653
I THINK IT WAS 10% FROM THE

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.489
FIRST PART OF MONEY- AND THEN

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:11.323
OBVIOUSLY THE APPLICATION

00:23:11.389 --> 00:23:12.891
DEADLINE IS TOMORROW SO NOT

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:15.393
EXPECTING ANY NEW. APPLICANTS TO

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.828
COME RIGHT AND SO WE'RE PLAYING

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.964
CATCH UP HERE FOR THE NEXT

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.965
COUPLE MONTHS WITH THIS

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:22.234
EXTENSION- THOUGH I HEAR YOUR

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.469
POINTS AND I THINK WE ALL OF HER

00:23:24.536 --> 00:23:26.338
THEM FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS AS

00:23:26.404 --> 00:23:27.272
WELL AROUND THE FRUSTRATIONS OF

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:29.441
THE PROGRAM- SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:23:29.508 --> 00:23:31.977
LET YOU KNOW WE CAN USE SOME OF

00:23:32.043 --> 00:23:33.879
THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THAT

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:35.714
HAND. FOR STAFFING. WELL I MEAN

00:23:35.781 --> 00:23:37.315
I JUST I SO I THINK THE

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:38.817
APPROPRIATIONS IS FINE. BUT IT'S

00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:40.385
ALSO A MATTER OF LIKE MAKING

00:23:40.452 --> 00:23:42.120
SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:23:42.187 --> 00:23:45.290
PROPERLY. FUNDED SO THAT YOU CAN

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:47.058
DO THE BUSINESS I MEAN BECAUSE

00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:48.927
THE NARRATIVE IN IS THAT

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:50.529
CALIFORNIA'S FLUSH WITH MONEY.

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.898
AND SO WE COULD PROBABLY YOU

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:57.435
KNOW. HEY UP FIRST AND FIGHT TO

00:23:57.502 --> 00:23:58.837
GET REIMBURSEMENT ON THE BACK I

00:23:58.904 --> 00:24:01.606
FROM THE FEDS IF THE GOAL IS TO

00:24:01.673 --> 00:24:02.641
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A PROGRAM

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:05.110
THAT IS PROPERLY FUNDED THAT IS

00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:05.911
SCALABLE THAT IS GETTING MONEY

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:07.979
OUT TO CONSTITUENTS AND JUST FOR

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:10.649
THE RECORD I HAVE TO SAY IS VERY

00:24:10.715 --> 00:24:12.017
HARD TO HEAR WHEN YOUR OWN

00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:13.318
COUNTY CALLS IN TO SAY. THEY

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:14.553
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE BILL.

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:16.721
YOU KNOW IF FORTY MILLION

00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.890
CALIFORNIANS THIS THING AT THE

00:24:18.957 --> 00:24:21.626
STATE LEVEL HAS GOTTEN OUT TO.

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:23.829
YOU KNOW MAYBE REACHING TWO

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:24.863
HUNDRED THOUSAND AS MEAN SO

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.398
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING ABOUT THE

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:28.200
FISCAL PART OF THIS BECAUSE- IF

00:24:28.266 --> 00:24:29.901
YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT WE HAVE TO

00:24:29.968 --> 00:24:31.636
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT RIGHT.

00:24:31.703 --> 00:24:34.005
AND I THINK. I SHARE THOSE

00:24:34.072 --> 00:24:37.809
CONCERNS AND- YOU KNOW THIS

00:24:37.876 --> 00:24:38.877
ISN'T A POLICY COMMITTEE BUT I

00:24:38.944 --> 00:24:41.947
DO THINK. AS THOSE ARE THE RIGHT

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:44.216
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKING- AND

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:45.650
ULTIMATELY I THINK THE GOAL THAT

00:24:45.717 --> 00:24:47.886
WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS GIVE

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:48.520
OURSELVES THAT TIME SAID THAT

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.788
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN.

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.356
IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM SO THAT

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:52.591
THOSE THAT ARE ON THE HOOK WILL

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:54.693
BE MADE WHOLE- BUT IDO THINK WE

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:57.529
HAVE TO HAVE- SOME ANALYSIS

00:24:57.596 --> 00:24:59.331
AROUND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

00:24:59.397 --> 00:24:59.998
PROGRAM. AND SOME LESSONS

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.534
LEARNED- THIS AND OTHER PROGRAMS

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.436
DURING KOPEN I THINK FALL IN

00:25:04.502 --> 00:25:06.504
THAT SAME CATEGORY- BUT I SHARE

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:08.206
THE CONCERN AND YOU'RE NOT WRONG

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:10.242
TO RAISE THE FLAGS- BUT THE

00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:11.877
POINT OF THIS BILLS TO REALLY

00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:12.744
GIVE THE ADMINISTRATION MORE

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.880
TIME. AND A CITY MORE TIME TO

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:16.514
HONOR THOSE COMMITMENTS AND THE

00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:18.383
OTHER THING I'LL SAY TO IS I

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.918
THINK THERE'S CONCERNS AROUND.

00:25:19.985 --> 00:25:21.519
THE OUTRAGE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHT

00:25:21.586 --> 00:25:22.921
WE DON'T HAVE AN EFFECTIVE WAY

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:25.323
TO COMMUNICATE TIS PROGRAM- AS

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.524
A GOVERNMENT THAT IT THAT EVEN

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:28.193
EXISTED. AND CRITICALLY FOR NON

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.160
NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:30.328
THOSE THAT MAYBE DON'T NAVIGATE

00:25:30.395 --> 00:25:31.997
GOVERNMENT- IN THE SAME WAY

00:25:32.063 --> 00:25:33.465
BECAUSE OF LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR

00:25:33.531 --> 00:25:35.100
OTHER ISSUES. THAT WAS A VERY

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:36.735
REAL CONCERN AND IT IS BEEN

00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:37.936
BORNE OUT WHEN YOU SEE WHO IS

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.771
ACTUALLY APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM-

00:25:39.838 --> 00:25:42.040
SO THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT I DO

00:25:42.107 --> 00:25:42.674
THINK NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. SO

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:44.709
HAS THERE BEEN ANY THOUGHT ABOUT

00:25:44.776 --> 00:25:48.013
IF IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN JUNE

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:49.614
TO GET TO THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:50.815
THE QUEUE. I MEAN I THINK IT'S

00:25:50.882 --> 00:25:53.551
OUR HOPE THAT THAT WILL GIVE US

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:55.353
ENOUGH TIME TO. TO HONOR ALL THE

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.055
COMMITMENTS THAT WE'VE HAD. I'M

00:25:57.122 --> 00:25:58.390
AT THE THRESHOLD OF GOING BEYOND

00:25:58.456 --> 00:25:59.858
THEFISCAL QUESTIONS SO I'M

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.294
GONNA RELEASE MYSELF FROM MY OWN

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:07.032
STRESS. THANK YOU. MISTER

QUESTIONING THAT- SENATOR CALM

00:26:14.272 --> 00:26:15.640
WATER HAVE BECAUSE I TOO HAVE

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:18.410
BEEN CONTACTED BY MY COUNTY I'VE

00:26:18.476 --> 00:26:20.478
BEEN CONTACTED BY A SMALL

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.714
LANDLORDS AND BEGAN TO HAVE THIS

00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:25.483
MONEY AND REALLY THE STATE JUST

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:27.953
LIKE ET DE WHERE THAT ROADBLOCK

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.188
WE'RE THEY IMPEDIMENT AND SO

00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:32.090
THAT BE FLUSHED WITH CASH OR

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:34.492
LEASE HAVING MONEY TO REIMBURSE

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:37.862
AND- MAKE FOLKS HOLD BUT WE

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:40.632
HAVE. NOT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO

00:26:40.699 --> 00:26:41.833
DISSEMINATING GET THE MONEY TO

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.401
THE PEOPLE AND NEEDS IT IS

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:45.370
ALMOST LIKE A FACADE IT'S ALMOST

00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:47.539
YOU KNOW THE ACTOR X. AND SO I

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:49.941
THINK STANDING UP THESE AGENCIES

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.276
AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

00:26:51.343 --> 00:26:55.046
PROPERLY STAFF WILL ALLOW US TO.

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:57.082
DO WHAT WE ARE ALL OUR

00:26:57.148 --> 00:26:58.049
INTENTIONS ARE TO MAKE PEOPLE

00:26:58.116 --> 00:26:59.751
HOLE BUT WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.953
INTERNAL WORKINGS WERE GONE YOU

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.255
KNOW FIRST FIXED FASTER

00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:05.423
FRUSTRATION WE'RE HERE TODAY

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.359
BECAUSE A POOR STAFFING AND POOR

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:10.128
PREPARATION FOR THIS SO I THINK

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:11.529
THAT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY I

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:13.965
THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME

00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:15.200
OF THE- FIRST QUESTIONS ASKED.

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:17.302
IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.803
GET THESE CHECKS TO PEOPLE WHO

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.239
NEED IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S

00:27:21.306 --> 00:27:23.208
STILL NOT IN PLACE. SIR BRADFORD

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:25.977
YOUR YOUR AGAIN RIGHT- ABOUT

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:28.680
YOUR COMMENTS- WHAT YOU'VE MADE-

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.783
HOWEVER- ALONG WITH THE CALL FOR

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:32.917
IMPROVEMENT AND MAKING SURE

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:35.020
STAFFING IS ADEQUATE. WE ARE

00:27:35.086 --> 00:27:37.522
FACING A DEADLINE THAT COMES TO

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:43.695
US TOMORROW AND. IF WE DON'T

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:46.331
TAKE ACTION AND HELP PEOPLE SO I

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.999
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.634
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

00:27:49.701 --> 00:27:51.469
CONTINUE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY

00:27:51.536 --> 00:27:53.204
TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AND MAKE

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.240
