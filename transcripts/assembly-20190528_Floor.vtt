01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:09.545
ACCOUNTS -- AND I COULD SEE HOW

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:11.013
REALISTICALLY.

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.447
GOING TO AN EVENT GOING OUT

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:15.517
CAMPAIGNING -- MAKING SPEECHES

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:16.852
THERE MAY BE A TIME WHEN YOU

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.821
NEED TO HAVE CHILD CARE AND THEN.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:19.354
THAT WOULD BE PART OF A

01:14:19.421 --> 01:14:21.256
LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN EXPENSE BUT

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.891
WHAT THIS ALSO HAS IN HERE IS

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.960
ALSO IN YOUR OFFICIAL DUTIES.

01:14:25.027 --> 01:14:26.862
AS AN OFFICE HOLDER.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.830
WELL THAT COULD COVER A WHOLE

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:29.698
HOST OF THINGS THAT AREN'T

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:32.201
NECESSARILY CAMPAIGN RELATED.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.635
THEY'RE JUST DOING THIS JOB.

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:34.903
WELL EVERYBODY ELSE OUT THERE IN

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.505
THE REAL WORLD HAS A JOB THAT

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.873
THEY HAVE TO DO.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.374
TO AND I DON'T THINK THAT WORRY

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:40.509
ARE MORE SPECIAL.

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:41.977
AS I SAID.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.079
THEN EVERYBODY ELSE.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:44.613
AND SO TO BE ABLE TO USE

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:45.781
CAMPAIGN.

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:48.016
FUNDS FOR SOMETHING THAT.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.084
IS REALLY A WORK RELATED

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.719
ACTIVITY NOT NECESSARILY A

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:52.154
CAMPAIGN.

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.722
RELATED ACTIVITY IS A IS A BIG

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:55.657
GRAY AREA.

01:14:55.724 --> 01:14:57.559
AND AGAIN I THINK IT IS A LITTLE

01:14:57.626 --> 01:14:59.962
BIT OF A YOU KNOW.

01:15:00.028 --> 01:15:02.464
A LITTLE BIT TONE DEAF -- IN

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:03.765
THIS THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:15:03.832 --> 01:15:04.600
HAVING TO MAKE THESE TOUGH

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.801
DECISIONS.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.102
AND WE'RE SORT OF PROVIDING OUR

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:08.904
OWN SELF.

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:10.772
A WAY TO SUBSIDIZE THAT.

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.774
SO I YOU KNOW THIS POINT I CAN'T

01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:16.278

01:15:38.867 --> 01:15:40.535
SUPPORT NETWORK AT HOME THIS

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:42.704
BODY SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:44.339
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:15:44.406 --> 01:15:46.074
AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:48.043
AMAZING WOMEN AND MEN IN IT WHO

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.511

VOTING ON THE THINGS THAT MATTER

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.120
TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN AND THIS IS

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.755
A SMALL STEP IN MAKING SURE

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.723
THOSE PEOPLE CAN RUN FOR OFFICE.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.524
THEY CAN REPRESENT THEIR

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.092
CONSTITUENTS AND THEY CAN HAVE A

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:06.495
VOICE IN THE ISSUES THAT WE VOTE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.163
ON DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

THIS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.535
I ASK THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:14.469
TO MAKE THIS BODY MORE

01:16:14.536 --> 01:16:16.471
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:18.106
CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:20.876
THANK WAS BAR CAM MS GONZALEZ.

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:21.543
THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK MY

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.545
COLLEAGUE BUT WHEN I ACTUALLY

01:16:23.612 --> 01:16:24.813
RAN FOR OFFICE I WAS A SINGLE

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.982
MOM WITH YOUNG KIDS.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.684
AND I MY KIDS WENT EVERYWHERE

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:31.753
WITH ME LARGELY BECAUSE THAT WAS

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:33.422
THE ONLY OPTION I HAD.

01:16:33.488 --> 01:16:34.923
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:36.558
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE TRUE

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.127
DIVERSITY IN ON THIS FLOOR. TO

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:41.296
DIVERSITY GOES BEYOND GENDER AND

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:42.564
RACE IT GOES TO LIFE

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:44.166
CIRCUMSTANCE AND I THINK THE

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.467
FACT THAT I WAS A SINGLE MOM

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.336
MAKES ME A BETTER LEGISLATOR I

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:48.070
THINK IT MADE IT.

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:50.572
ENSURES THAT I AM MORE AWARE OF

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:52.207
THE TYPE OF PEOPLE WERE WORRIED

01:16:52.274 --> 01:16:54.443
ABOUT OFFENDING A SUPPOSEDLY --

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:55.644
THAT THAT DON'T HAVE THOSE

01:16:55.711 --> 01:16:57.813
OPPORTUNITIES I AM CONFIDENT

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.348
THAT YOU COULD ASK ANY.

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.683
WORKING FAMILY WORKING SINGLE

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.185
MOM ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT OF

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:04.619
WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD BE ABLE

01:17:04.686 --> 01:17:06.288
TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO PAY FOR

01:17:06.355 --> 01:17:07.089
CHILD CARE AND THEY SAY

01:17:07.155 --> 01:17:08.190
ABSOLUTELY.

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:09.057
AND BY THE WAY THE THING THAT'S

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.726
A LITTLE OFF IS WE COULD

01:17:10.792 --> 01:17:12.661
ACTUALLY USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.663
PAY FOR CHILDCARE OVERALL AT AN

01:17:14.730 --> 01:17:16.932
EVENT. TO SERVE OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.633
KIDS OUR OWN STAFF KIDS BUT NOT

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.701
FOR OURSELVES WITHOUT SOME

01:17:19.768 --> 01:17:20.969
CLARITY.

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.604
IT WE'RE NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

01:17:22.671 --> 01:17:23.905
IF I HAVE A FRIEND WHO OWNS A

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:27.609
CHILD CARE FACILITY THEY SAID

01:17:27.676 --> 01:17:28.243
THAT'S OKAY LEAVE YOUR KIDS WITH

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.710
ME.

01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:29.911
FEW NIGHTS A WEEK AND IT IT IT'S

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.747
NO PROBLEM THAT IS A PROBLEM

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.314
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.415
TAKE THAT GIFT.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:35.584
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:36.385
TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S TRUE

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:38.687
DIVERSEY ON THIS FLOOR THAT INTO

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:39.988
CLUES DIVERSITY OF CLASS AND

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:41.156
CIRCUMSTANCE.

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.090
AND I'D SAY THAT THIS IS ONE

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.692
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M

01:17:43.759 --> 01:17:45.927
PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:48.163
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE.

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.078
HAVE FIVE KIDS MYSELF WHEN I RAN

01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:04.646
FOR OFFICE MY KIDS WERE ALL.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:07.549
FAIRLY YOUNG AND WE DID NOT --

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.084
WE MADE IT WORK AND I REALIZE

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:10.052
THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN DO THAT

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.420
ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS A

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.387
CHOICE.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.289
IT'S VOLUNTARY NOBODY HAS TO RUN

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.091
PROP ISSUE NOT DRAFTED INTO THE

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.025
POSITION.

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:17.759
AND SO YOU HAVE TO MAKE

01:18:17.826 --> 01:18:19.094
ARRANGEMENTS LIKE YOU WOULD ANY

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.263
OTHER JOB. TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:22.964
FOR CHILD CARE.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.466
AND THOUGH IT'S NOT TAXPAYER

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.234
MONEY IS COMING FROM DONORS -- I

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:29.137
JUST I I DON'T SEE THIS AS AN

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:32.674
APPROPRIATE -- EXPENSE I THINK

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:34.609
IT MAKES US LOOK ELITIST I THINK

01:18:34.676 --> 01:18:35.610
IT MAKES US LOOK LIKE WE'RE

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:37.546
PRIMA DONNAS BECAUSE WE THINK

01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:40.182
THAT WE DESERVE. TO HAVE SPECIAL

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:41.817
TREATMENT IS SPECIAL CHILD CARE

01:18:41.883 --> 01:18:44.152
AND HAVE THAT FUNDED BY SOMEONE

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.688
OTHER THAN OURSELVES.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:48.156
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:49.691
ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:50.692
WHO ARE TRYING TO PAY THEIR

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.427
CHILD CARE BILLS YOU DON'T HAVE

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.728
A SEPARATE ACCOUNT OF DONORS

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.931
THAT THEY CAN USE. TO PAY -- FOR

01:18:55.997 --> 01:18:57.632
THAT CHILD CARE SO RESPECTFULLY

01:18:57.699 --> 01:19:00.235
THOUGH I I APPRECIATE WHAT THE

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:03.371
AUTHORS ARE -- TRYING TO DO.

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:05.140

FIRST I LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.616
I'D LIKE TO THINK MY COLLEAGUES

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.351
THAT SPOKE ABOUT SINGLE MOTHERS

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:17.986
HERE ON THIS FLOOR.

01:19:18.053 --> 01:19:19.855
AS A SINGLE MOTHER TODAY AS I

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.189
CAME TO THIS FLOOR MY DAUGHTER

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.724
WAS BORN BETWEEN MY GENERAL MY

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:23.892
PRIMARY.

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:26.128
I WASN'T SINGLE AND SO I KNOW

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:27.863
BOTH SIDES OF THIS COIN.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.564
I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING THIS

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.533
PLACE HAS BEEN AS I HAVE BECOME

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.035
SINGLE AND WHETHER THAT WAS ME

01:19:34.102 --> 01:19:36.505
HAVING TO GO BUY A CAR SO THAT I

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:38.473
COULD PARTICIPATE HERE OR IT IS

01:19:38.540 --> 01:19:40.642
ABOUT MY DAUGHTER BEING ALLOWED

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.611
TO BE IN THIS SPACE.

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:44.279
I LOVE BEING A LEGISLATOR I AM

01:19:44.346 --> 01:19:45.447
GOOD AT IT AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:47.048
IS MY CHOICE.

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.783
IT'S MY CHOICE TO BE HERE.

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.352
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:52.187
DIVERSITY IS A PERSPECTIVE ON

01:19:52.254 --> 01:19:55.056
THIS FLOOR THEN WE MUST BE ABLE

01:19:55.123 --> 01:19:57.692
TO AS PARTICIPANTS HERE SUPPORT

01:19:57.759 --> 01:19:58.693
EACH OTHER.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.795
AND ONE OF THE WAYS WE DO THAT

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:01.363
IS BY VOTING FOR THINGS LIKE

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:02.430
THIS.

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.865
TONE DEAF I DON'T THINK THIS IS

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.634
TONE DEAF.

01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:06.735
I DON'T THINK THIS MEASURES TONE

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:07.636
DEAF AND ANYWAY.

01:20:07.702 --> 01:20:09.838
I THINK OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:12.240
THAT SINGLE MOTHERS DON'T FACE

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:13.775
CHALLENGE ARE TONE DEAF.

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:15.710
THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT SINGLE

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:17.212
MOTHERS DON'T BELONG HERE ARE

01:33:08.115 --> 01:33:09.750
THAT ARE PRIVATE WITHIN OUR HOME

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.752
AND THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:12.820
TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:33:12.887 --> 01:33:15.056
SHARED.

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:17.258

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:18.526
THAT IS WHAT MY BILL SEEKS

01:33:18.592 --> 01:33:18.826
[inaudible]

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.561
TO PREVENT.

01:33:20.628 --> 01:33:21.529
THERE IS NO WHERE WHERE THE

01:33:21.595 --> 01:33:22.563
RIGHT TO PRIVACY IS MORE

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:23.831
IMPORTANT THAN IN OUR HOMES

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:24.432
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE OUR MOST

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:25.599
IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS OF OUR

01:33:25.666 --> 01:33:26.968
LIVES.

01:33:27.034 --> 01:33:27.969
WE TELL OUR KIDS TO PICK UP THE

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.804
ROOMS.

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.272
WHEN THEY DON'T WE YELL AT THEM

01:33:31.339 --> 01:33:33.441

01:33:41.515 --> 01:33:42.650
WE HAVE THESE PERSONAL

01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:44.151
CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE SECTOR

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.720
OF OUR HOMES BECAUSE WE PROTECT

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:47.521
AND TRUST THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.856
BE RECORDED WITHOUT OUR CONSENT

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:52.159
BUT THAT IS HAPPENING.

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.494
I'D I COMMIT TO YOU AND I'VE

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:54.895
COMMITTED TO MANY MANY MEMBERS

01:33:54.962 --> 01:33:56.630
ON THIS.

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:57.898
FOR WE WILL WORK ON THIS BILL WE

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.767
WE HAVE ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY WE

01:33:59.834 --> 01:34:01.268
HAVE ENGAGE WITH STAKEHOLDERS.

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:02.503
AND I WILL NOT BRING A BILL BACK

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:03.938
FROM THE SENATE.

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:05.840
UNLESS WE HAVE FIXED ALL THE

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:07.875
ISSUES THAT REMAIN WITH IT.

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.176
AND WE PRODUCED IT TO ITS CORE

01:34:09.243 --> 01:34:11.112
INTENT WHICH IS TO RESTORE THE

01:34:11.178 --> 01:34:12.613
BASELINE OF TRUST.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.148
THAT WE ALL HAVE AND NOT BASED

01:34:14.215 --> 01:34:16.150
ON A TRUST MEMBERS IS IS GOING

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.718
TO ALLOW THESE DEVICES TO

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:19.687
DEVELOP AND FLOURISH THAT TRUST

01:34:19.754 --> 01:34:20.888
HAS BEEN BREACHED.

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:22.790
WE NEED TO RESTORE IT THIS IS A

01:34:22.857 --> 01:34:24.225
POSITIVE STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:25.292
DIRECTION.

01:34:25.359 --> 01:34:26.327
AND I THINK IT'S TIME WE GIVE

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:28.295
CONSUMERS BACK THE CONTROL AND

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:29.196
THE CHOICE.

01:34:29.263 --> 01:34:30.798
SO THAT WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO

01:34:30.865 --> 01:34:32.133
BRING A SPEAKER INTO THEIR HOME.

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:32.867
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GETTING

01:34:32.933 --> 01:34:33.801
INTO.

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.169
AND THEY CAN CONSENT BEFORE THEY

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:36.604
ARE RECORDED.

01:34:36.670 --> 01:34:38.406
THIS AS A BIPARTISAN AUTHORSHIP

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.875
IT CAME OUT OF PRIVACY COMMITTEE

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:41.976

RELUCTANT OPPOSITION TO AB.

01:35:42.103 --> 01:35:43.137
THIRTEEN NINETY FIVE AS STATED.

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:44.572
RIGHT NOW THIS BILL WOULD

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.974
PROHIBIT THE SALE OF VOICE

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.876
ACTIVATED SPEAKERS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:50.111
AND I KNOW EVERYONE SAYING NO NO

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:50.711
WAIT THAT'S NOT WHAT THE BILL

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:52.480
SAYS BUT I KNOW OF WHAT I SPEAK

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:54.748
SO IN REAL LIFE I OWN A SOFTWARE

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.016
DEVELOPMENT COMPANY AND ABOUT

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.418
TEN YEARS AGO WE DID.

01:35:57.485 --> 01:36:00.688
A VOICE ACTIVATED TOY THAT YOU

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:02.189
COMMUNICATED WITH BY SPEAKING TO

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:02.723
IT.

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:04.325
AND SO I'VE WRITTEN A SOFTWARE

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:05.993
THAT INTERFACES WITH ONE OF THE

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:07.228
EARLY VOICE ACTIVATION SHIPS

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:08.295
UNDER THE CURRENT PRODUCTS OR AN

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:08.829
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:10.598
SOPHISTICATED THAN WHAT WE DID

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.700
TEN YEARS AGO BUT I KNOW ABOUT

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:14.268
THE SONG THE THE THE PROCEDURES

01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.637
THAT YOU'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:17.238
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:17.972
SAYING.

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:19.173
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.908
STEMS FROM THE INCLUSION OF A

01:36:20.975 --> 01:36:22.143
SINGLE WORD OF THE BILL WHICH IS

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.911
THE WORD RETAIN.

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:24.411
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.546
PROHIBITING.

01:36:25.613 --> 01:36:27.181
THE SALE OR THE SHARING OF

01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:29.150
INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES I

01:36:29.216 --> 01:36:30.618
THINK THAT THAT IS APPROPRIATE

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:32.186
BUT NOT ALLOWING THE DEVICE TO

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:34.488
RETAIN A USER'S VOICE RECORDED

01:36:34.555 --> 01:36:35.589
ON THE DEVICE.

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:37.057
WOULD PROHIBIT THE VOICE FROM --

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:38.626
THE DEVICE FROM FUNCTIONING AT

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:41.262
ALL AND IRONICALLY ONE OF THE

01:36:41.328 --> 01:36:42.963
SITUATIONS THAT WE WERE TALKING

01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.564
ABOUT WITH THIS BILL WAS HEARD

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:44.298
AND PRIVACY.

01:36:44.365 --> 01:36:45.866
WAS THE FACT THAT THERE IS

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:49.470
CONCERN THAT WHEN YOU SPEAK THE

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:52.439
WAKE WORD. TO A DEVICE THAT THAT

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:53.207
WOULD THE VOICES IN THE DEVICES

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.041
SUPPOSED TO WAKE UP AND START

01:36:54.108 --> 01:36:54.675
LISTENING TO WHAT YOU HAVE TO

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:55.276
SAY AND THERE'S CONCERN THAT

01:36:55.342 --> 01:36:56.677
SOMETIMES.

01:36:56.744 --> 01:36:58.546
THE DEVICE THINK SAID HERE'S THE

01:36:58.612 --> 01:36:59.747
WAKE WORD BUT IT ACTUALLY DIDN'T.

01:36:59.813 --> 01:37:01.215
AND SO WE CAN RECORD THINGS THAT

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:02.449
ARE INAPPROPRIATE RIGHT I THINK

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:03.817
THAT THAT IS A VALID CONCERN BUT

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:05.519
IRONICALLY PROHIBITING THE

01:37:05.586 --> 01:37:07.621
DEVICE FROM RETAINING YOUR VOICE

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:09.323
AND LEARNING FROM YOUR VOICE AND

01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:10.391
GETTING TRAINED IN.

01:37:10.457 --> 01:37:11.792
WHAT YOU SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU SAY

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:12.993
THE WAKE WORD MAKES IT A LOT

01:37:13.060 --> 01:37:15.196
MORE LIKELY THAT THE DEVICE WILL

01:37:15.262 --> 01:37:16.497
WAKE UP AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME

01:37:16.564 --> 01:37:17.498
SAID RECORDED APPROPRIATE

01:37:17.565 --> 01:37:19.166
CONVERSATION SO I URGE THE

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:21.602
AUTHOR? TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.636
AT THIS I'M IN SUPPORT OF THAT

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:24.338
THE ENTIRETY OF THE REST OF THE

01:37:24.405 --> 01:37:26.173
BILL EXCEPT THAT THAT ONE PART

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:27.708
RETAIN I'VE SERIOUS TECHNICAL

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:31.312
PROBLEMS WITH SO FOR NOW I

OBERNOLTE BUT I ARJUN AYE VOTE.

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:41.355
I WENT OVER AND TALKED TO THE

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.891
AUTHOR AND EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT

01:37:43.958 --> 01:37:45.059
IF YOU DON'T ALLOW SOMETHING TO

01:37:45.125 --> 01:37:48.162
BE STORED YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.798
THAT PERSON'S VOICE FURTHER ALL

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.933
THOSE STORED VOICES THEY USE A

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.336
I'D. TO DETERMINE.

01:37:55.402 --> 01:37:58.305
THE BEST WAY TO INTERPRET PEOPLE

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.174
WITH ACCENTS AT CETERA AND IT

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:02.009
JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER IF

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:03.077
YOU STORAGE.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.713
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IS THEN

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:07.448
GIVING IT TO SOMEONE ELSE I HAVE

01:38:07.514 --> 01:38:08.983

I AGREE WITH THE POINT I BELIEVE

01:38:15.656 --> 01:38:17.091
THAT THE AUTHOR IS WORKING WITH

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:19.326
THE OPPOSITION PLEASE LET THIS

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:20.861
BILL GO TO THE SENATE IF IT'S

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:22.830
STILL A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES

01:38:22.896 --> 01:38:26.400
BACK WE CAN LOOK AT IT THEN.

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:29.670

THAT ALLOWS THE TECHNOLOGY TO

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:52.826

THEIR FAMILIES.

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:52.105
THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES CAL

01:51:52.172 --> 01:51:53.540
OSHA INVESTIGATE WORK SITES THAT

01:51:53.606 --> 01:51:55.275

PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:02.182
IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESSES

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:03.616
AND EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THEY CAN

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.585
IDENTIFY ISSUES SOONER RATHER

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:06.686
THAN MANY YEARS LATER WHEN IT'S

01:52:06.753 --> 01:52:08.421
WAY MORE COSTLY FOR THEM TO

RECTIFY THE SITUATION OR THEY

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:12.325

FURTHER DOWN THE LINE.

CAPTIVITY THEY SUFFER.

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:03.563

HAVE TOLD US THROUGH THEIR VOTES.

01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:06.966
THAT THEY VALUE PROTECTING

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:09.636
ANIMAL WELFARE THEY HAVE VOTED.

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.004
TO MAKE SURE THAT FARM ANIMALS

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:12.605

SUFFERING.

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:23.249
BUT YOU CANNOT TELL CALIFORNIANS

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:23.850
THAT THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:25.418
BUYING.

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:27.687
IN A CLOTHING STORE THAT USED

01:55:27.754 --> 01:55:29.389
USES FOR PRODUCTS IS RAISED TO

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:31.057
THE STANDARD TO THE VOTERS HAVE

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:32.859
TOLD US THEY WANT AN ANIMAL

01:55:32.925 --> 01:55:34.193
PRODUCTS.

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.195
BECAUSE OF THAT MANY OF OUR

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:37.730
MAJOR MANUFACTURERS

01:55:37.797 --> 01:55:40.199
MANUFACTURERS LIKE MICHAEL CORES

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:43.036
GUCCI JIMMY CHOO ARMANI BURBERRY

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:44.537
CHANEL VERSACE AND OTHERS.

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:45.872
HAVE ALL ANNOUNCED THAT THEY ARE

01:55:45.938 --> 01:55:47.974
NO LONGER USING FOR PRODUCTS IN

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:49.942
FACT ONE OF THEM WROTE THAT THEY

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:53.780
TRIED TO FIND AN ETHICAL SOURCE.

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:54.681
FOR FOR AND WHEN AROUND THE

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.215
WORLD LOOKING FOR THAT AND COULD

01:55:56.282 --> 01:55:58.184
NOT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE

01:55:58.251 --> 01:56:00.119
WAS ANY FOR MANUFACTURE UP TO

01:56:00.186 --> 01:56:01.054
THE STANDARDS THAT THEIR

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:02.622
CUSTOMERS WANTED.

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:03.890
AND SO THEY WERE NO LONGER

01:56:03.956 --> 01:56:05.291
COULDN'T GOING TO USE.

01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:06.592
FOR SO YOU MAY ASK WHY DO WE

01:56:06.659 --> 01:56:07.360
NEED THIS OF SO MANY

01:56:07.427 --> 01:56:08.995
MANUFACTURERS ALREADY TURNING

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:10.096
AWAY FROM.

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:11.531
FOR THE REASON IS BECAUSE OUR

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:13.433
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WANT TO

01:56:13.499 --> 01:56:14.200
KNOW THAT WHEN THEY BUY A

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:15.501
PRODUCT OFF OF THE SHELVES IT'S

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:16.636
SAFE.

01:56:16.703 --> 01:56:17.970
AND THEY ALSO WANT TO KNOW THAT

01:56:18.037 --> 01:56:19.172
IF THEY BUY A PRODUCT.

01:56:19.238 --> 01:56:20.540
THAT USES ANIMALS OF THOSE

01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:21.674
ANIMALS HAVE BEEN HUMANELY

01:56:21.741 --> 01:56:23.076
RAISED AND SLAUGHTERED AND WE

01:56:23.142 --> 01:56:25.545
CANNOT DO THAT WITH FOR PRODUCTS.

01:56:25.611 --> 01:56:27.780
UNLIKE WITH ANIMALS REYES FOR

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:30.116
FOR THERE ARE NO FEDERAL LAWS.

01:56:30.183 --> 01:56:31.751
DICTATING HOW FOR BEARING

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:35.154
ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED.

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:36.456
THERE IS NO REGULATION IN THIS

01:56:36.522 --> 01:56:38.458
INDUSTRY I AM VERY VERY MANY OF

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:39.726
OUR FOR PRODUCTS ORIGINATE

01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:41.627
OVERSEAS WERE OUR LAWS DON'T

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:42.595
TOUCH.

01:56:42.662 --> 01:56:44.130
AND IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO

01:56:44.197 --> 01:56:46.899
NOT HAVE LAWS AT ALL THAT GOVERN

01:56:46.966 --> 01:56:50.770
ANIMAL WELFARE.

01:56:50.837 --> 01:56:52.071
MEMBERS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:54.674
BILL FOR THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS

01:56:54.741 --> 01:56:55.875

01:56:55.942 --> 01:56:57.310
PERFECTLY IN KEEPING WITH THE

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:59.178
VALUES OF CALIFORNIA MANY OF OUR

01:56:59.245 --> 01:57:00.713
MAJOR CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES

02:02:50.896 --> 02:02:52.298
LITTLE BIT BEHIND HERE STATES

02:02:52.364 --> 02:02:54.300
LIKE FLORIDA GEORGIA AND

02:02:54.366 --> 02:02:56.502
OKLAHOMA ARE LEADING IN THIS

02:02:56.569 --> 02:02:58.304
EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS

02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:59.538
HAVE YOU NARAL PERSONAL ACCESS

02:02:59.605 --> 02:03:01.607
TO EARLY EDUCATION.

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.075
BEFORE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN.

02:03:03.142 --> 02:03:04.610
THIS BILL ACCOMPLICES THIS WITH

02:03:04.677 --> 02:03:06.378
A DELICATE BALANCE OF INCREASING

02:03:06.445 --> 02:03:08.447
ACCESS WILL ALSO FOCUSING ON OUR

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:09.782
WORK FORCE.

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:12.284
THE MAIN ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS

02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.220
IT EXPANDS OUR EXISTING STATE

02:03:14.286 --> 02:03:15.988
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:18.090
THAT ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE THREE

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:20.159

02:03:20.226 --> 02:03:21.527
A SEAT IN OUR EXISTING.

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:23.529
PROGRAMS WE INCREASE

02:03:23.596 --> 02:03:25.264
QUALIFICATIONS FOR FUTURE HEAD

02:03:25.331 --> 02:03:26.899
PRESCHOOL TEACHERS FOCUSING ON

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:28.567
THE WORK FORCE AND QUALITY AND

02:03:28.634 --> 02:03:30.136
FRANKLY I THINK MOST IMPORTANT

02:03:30.202 --> 02:03:31.437
FOR ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS.

02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:33.305
WE EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO MAKE

02:03:33.372 --> 02:03:34.907
SURE THAT MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:36.976
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO

02:03:37.042 --> 02:03:38.277
PRESCHOOL BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.745
EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL COSTS

02:03:39.812 --> 02:03:40.679
IN THE SAME.

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:43.582
AS UC BERKELEY AND UCLA.

02:03:43.649 --> 02:03:45.084
THERE ARE TOO MANY KIDS FROM

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:48.020
FAMILIES THAT ARE TOO RICH TO

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.522
QUALIFY FOR THE FREE.

02:03:49.588 --> 02:03:53.192
BUT TOO POOR TO PAY THE ONE TO

02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:54.026
TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IT

02:03:54.093 --> 02:03:56.228
COST FOR FULL DAY PRESCHOOL

02:03:56.295 --> 02:03:57.530
PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:59.265
AND THE TRUTH IS IS TOO MANY OF

02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:00.466
OUR YOUNGSTERS START

02:04:00.533 --> 02:04:04.270
KINDERGARTEN BEHIND ND THEY

02:04:04.336 --> 02:04:05.237
NEVER CATCH UP.

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:06.205
THEY NEVER CATCH UP.

02:04:06.272 --> 02:04:07.206
SO IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:09.909
ADDRESSING INCOME INEQUALITY.

02:04:09.975 --> 02:04:12.378
INTER GENERATIONAL POVERTY.

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:14.313
CHILDHOOD POVERTY.

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.048
THE APPALLING HIGH SCHOOL DROP

02:04:16.115 --> 02:04:18.217
OUT RATE AND EVEN THE CRUEL PATH

02:04:18.284 --> 02:04:20.252

02:04:20.319 --> 02:04:21.287
THE DAY THEY WERE ATTEMPTING

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:23.322
ADDRESS WE MUST GET SERIOUS

02:04:23.389 --> 02:04:24.456
ABOUT INVESTING IN EARLY

02:05:11.971 --> 02:05:13.439
WE ALSO KNOW THAT EARLY LEARNING

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:14.573
EXPERIENCES ARE PARTICULARLY

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:16.275

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:30.256
IN MICHIGAN.

02:05:30.322 --> 02:05:32.591
WHAT IS NOW KNOWN IS THAT PERRY

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:38.631
DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS?

02:05:38.697 --> 02:05:39.598
THE PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY

02:05:39.665 --> 02:05:41.300

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:42.401
SCORES OF KIDS.

02:05:42.468 --> 02:05:43.469
BUT A FEW YEARS THE DATA SHOWED

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:45.004
THAT.

02:05:45.070 --> 02:05:46.505
IT DIDN'T DO THAT BUT AS

02:05:46.572 --> 02:05:48.140
RESEARCHERS TRACKED THE KIDS

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:50.442

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:54.713
LIFE OUTCOMES IN THE KIDS INTO

02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.048

LESS TROUBLE WITH THE LAW.

02:06:01.287 --> 02:06:03.822
