01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:57.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.221 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.656 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DO I HAVE TO GO WITH CIVIL

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

THEY ASK.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:06.695 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHEN I SAY THEY ITS PRIDE OKAY

01:16:06.762 --> 01:16:09.631 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OKAY. IN THE DISABILITY VITAMIN.

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:11.833 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S WHO I'M SPEAKING ABOUT

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.335 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:15.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WITH THAT I HAVE TO GO WITH THE

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.873 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PROCESS IN THE PROCESS FILLS ME

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:18.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH CIVIL

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.741 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SERVICE.

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:20.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:23.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO DO WE HELD EVENTS AT THE CH

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
C. F. SPECIFICALLY WE TOOK

01:16:32.854 --> 01:16:34.489 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THEIR EMPLOYEES ON THE

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:36.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CERTIFICATION LIST BECAUSE

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:38.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT'S THEIR PATH TO BECOMING

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:39.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES.

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND WE'VE GOT A NUMBER OF

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.598 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ADDITIONAL EVENTS THAT WE'VE

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

IT. WITH THAT RECRUITMENT EFFORT

01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:56.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%

I'M DOING WHAT I THEY'RE DOING

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND LIKE I

01:22:14.529 --> 01:22:16.131 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROGRAM THAT WOULD BASICALLY

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALLOW THESE INDIVIDUALS TO

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.611 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DESIGNATION THAT COMES WITH IT

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHEN I ASKED MY STAFF TO LOOK AT

UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO GET ON

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE ONE WITH THE CF DESIGNATION

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.400 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN ORDER TO WORK FOR US BECAUSE.

01:23:25.467 --> 01:23:26.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT IS THE LEAD LISTS WE WOULD

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:28.103 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%

DID YOU HAVE THEM MADAM CHAIR IF

I MIGHT.

01:23:41.449 --> 01:23:42.484 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS I THINK

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:43.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT TED NOT TO TO COMPLICATE

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:44.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THIS BUT. CERTAINLY THE OFFER OF

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.755 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A PLACE ON THE LIST DOES NOT

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ASSURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BE ABLE TO BE EMPLOYED.

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:52.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EITHER THROUGH LEAP OR

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.730 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OTHERWISE AND AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:59.267 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THAT THE LIST HAS.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:23:59.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:00.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THOSE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR THIS

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:03.471 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:70%
JOB THAT ARE NOT INDIVIDUALS
WHO.

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:06.107 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CURRENTLY ARE EMPLOYED IN THE

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:07.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
POSITION WHERE F..

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
WITH PRIDE RIGHT NOW.

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:11.346 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
SO THERE IS.

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT CHANCE

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND AGAIN LOOKING A BIT TO

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HISTORY THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.752 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE NOT ALL GOING TO BE PICKED

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:20.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP OR EVEN IF THEY DO THEY MAY

01:24:20.221 --> 01:24:21.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THERE MAY BE SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:22.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
GAP.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.993 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
IN BETWEEN THE.

01:24:25.059 --> 01:24:27.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DATE OF TERMINATION AND AND IF

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THEY MAKE THEIR WAY.

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:31.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UP ON THE LIST THE OTHER THING

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT WHAT

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:35.136 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
PRIDE PROVIDES.

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.372 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.546 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:60%
THINK POSITIONS FOR. JOB
COACHES.

REASONABLE SOLUTION I THINK
THAT.

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:20.007 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY SEEM ZERO SUM IT'S NOT AND

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:43.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE NEED TO SORT THIS OUT AND WE

01:46:43.864 --> 01:46:45.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO DO

01:46:45.332 --> 01:46:45.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT SO I I WOULD HOPE THAT WE

01:46:45.932 --> 01:46:47.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
WOULD.

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:48.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
I HAVE THEM.

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:50.370 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%

TO SAY IF IT'S.

01:46:55.876 --> 01:46:57.344 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ON THE SURFACE APPEARS TO BE

01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:58.745 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RELATIVELY SIMPLE BUT I GUESS IT

01:46:58.812 --> 01:46:59.780 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
REALLY IS NOT MUCH MORE

01:46:59.846 --> 01:47:01.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
COMPLICATED. THAN WHAT IT

01:47:01.481 --> 01:47:02.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
APPEARS TO BE AND I THINK

01:47:02.816 --> 01:47:03.416 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERYONE'S HEART IS IN THE RIGHT

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:05.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PLACE. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE GET

AND SO FORTH AND SO ON.

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:10.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE OUR

REVIEWED IT. REALIZED IT WAS A

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:48.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
VIOLATION OF THAT GOVERNMENT

THE BOARD WE THINK THAT THERE'S

01:50:43.236 --> 01:50:45.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
A PATHWAY THAT EXISTS THAT THE

01:50:45.538 --> 01:50:47.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
