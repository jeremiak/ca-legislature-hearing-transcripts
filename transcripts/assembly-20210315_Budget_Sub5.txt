CHEAP THEATER WITH SEVEN MAINTENANCE CONSTRUCTION BUDGET PROPOSALS RECORDED SUPPORT THE FACILITY PROGRAMS MULTIPRONGED STRATEGY TO ENSURE RELIABLE SAFE AND FUNCTIONAL COURT WILL BE FOR CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK WITH. JEFF A REMINDER PARTMINER FINE AS MENTIONED BY THE G. POWER THE IMMEDIATE PACKAGE INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO RESTORE THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS ONGOING REDUCTION FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT WAS INCLUDED IN A TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT SPECIFICALLY HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE WILLIAM B. WILL BE RESTORED TO THE TRIAL COURT AND TWENTY THREE POINT ONE MILLION WILL BE RESTORED FOR THE STATE LOCAL JUDICIARY. BEGINNING IN 212-120-2120 TWO IN ONGOING THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SHOULD USE THESE FUNDS TO MEET THEIR CHANGING OPERATIONAL AND PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION THE BUDGET CONSOLIDATES THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND IN THE IMMEDIATE CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT WHICH ARE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH FACILITIES PROGRAM THIS FUND CONSOLIDATION ALLOWS FOR THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION WENT TO REMAIN SOLVENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR IN AVOID PRODUCING SERVICE LEVELS FOR THE FACILITIES PROGRAM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE CONSOLIDATED FUND WILL HAVE SOLVENCY ISSUES IN FUTURE YEARS AND WE APPRECIATE THE- L. A. AS RECOMMENDED APPROACH SHIFTING THESE FUNDS TO THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S ONE POSSIBLE STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING THE ONGOING PROBLEM. HOWEVER WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS INCLUDING OPTIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT IMMEDIATE GENERAL FUND COMMITMENT. IN OR WE AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO DO SO. AT THE END THE IMMINENT SOLVENCY OF THESE FUNDS IS ONE MANIFESTATION OF A BROADER PROBLEM RELATED TO DECLINING FINING FEE REVENUES IN RECENT YEARS. WHICH IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED A VARIETY OF RECIP RECIPIENT FUNDS. ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE THE TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND. THEREFORE ANY SOLUTION. SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF ADDRESSING IT FOR THE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS. FOR NOW- FUND CONSOLIDATION ALLOWS FOR THE FUND TO REMAIN SOLVENT WITHOUT REDUCING SERVICE LEVELS IN REQUIRING A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR WHILE WE DEVELOP A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY. IN THESE FUNDS AND OTHERS. THANK YOU LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU AND ARE BIGGER FOR THE PANEL. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PROPOSALS THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU WE DO HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AT MINIMUM WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CONSOLIDATION BECAUSE IT DOES DELAY THE NEED TO ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY AND THE BUDGET HERE AND THERE REALLY IS NO RATIONALE FOR MAINTAINING TWO SEPARATE ACCOUNTS ONE BOTH OF THEM ARE GOING TO BECOME INSOLVENT. ANYWAYS I'M HOWEVER AS A REFERENCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THERE ISN'T REALLY A PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT'S INSOLVENCY PERMANENTLY SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE GO FURTHER BY ELIMINATING THE ACCOUNTS AND SHIFTING FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND- AND THIS IS BECAUSE ABSENT ANY CHANGES. SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED TO SUPPORT EXISTING OBLIGATIONS WHICH IS MOST NOTABLY THAT SERVICE FOR COURTHOUSES THAT WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED CONSTRUCTION FOR AND SO WE ESTIMATE THAT AROUND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION COULD BE NEEDED BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND THAT'S WHAT DECLINE OVER TIME AS PROJECTS WERE PAID OFF BUT WE LIKELY NEED GENERAL FUND RESOURCES FOR THE NEXT SIXTEEN YEARS AND SO OUR RECOMMENDATION TO SHIFT THESE OBLIGATIONS OVER WOULD PERMANENTLY ADDRESS THE INSOLVENCY AND ENSURE THAT ANY GENERAL FUND CONSTRUCTED CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING THE STATE'S FISCAL CONDITION AND FIGURING OUT. WHICH ARE OFTEN PRIORITIES. I IN ONE WITH THE ELIMINATE OF THE TWO. ACCOUNTS WE ARE ALSO- RECOMMENDING SHIFTING OVER ALL NON CONSTRUCTION RELATED EXPENSES SUCH AS THE AMOUNT- PROVIDED FOR TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS AND HAVING AN APPROPRIATION TO JUST MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING DEPOSITING ALL OF THE REVENUE THAT WOULD NORMALLY GO INTO THE CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNTS INTO THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD SO THAT THEY ARE STILL AVAILABE TO OFFSET ALL OF THOSE EXPENDITURE OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE SHIFTED OVER. MOVING FORWARD WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO FIND ANY NEW TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS FROM THE GENERAL FUND. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FULLY AWARE OF THE TOTAL COSTS FOR ANY NEW PROPOSED PROJECTS THE IMPACTS THAT THE HAVE ON THE GENERAL FUND. AND HOW LEGISLATURE GOING TO WEIGH THEM AGAINST OTHER PRIORITIES. HOWEVER WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHICH SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS TO FUND BASED ON ITS PRIORITIES WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED. BY THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND THE BUDGET YEAR OR THE ADDITIONAL TWELVE PROJECTS THAT ARE SLATED TO COME ON BOARD IN THE NEXT FOUR YEARS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. NOT THANK YOUNG ANNETTE OPEN IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- BUT BEFORE THAT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION- I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND IF THEY CAN SPEAK TO WHAT THE DELAYS ARE LOOKING LIKE FOR TRIALS AND CIVIL MATTERS. ALL RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THAT THERE'S CONCERN FOR THE LACE LITIGANTS ARE FACING PHOENIX THE NEXT PICK AND- HARDSHIPS- AND SO WHEN THEY NEED YOU SPEAK TO THAT AND TO SPEAK OF THIS REGIONAL. OF VARIANCE OR IF IT'S LOOKING THE SAME ACROSS THE STATE. WE MIGHT HAVE THAT ROBBO YOUNG POTENTIALLY RESPOND TO THAT IF THERE'S SUCH DATA DATA. WE HAVE IN TERMS OF CIVIL ACT WORKLOAD DELAYS. AND ANY REGIONAL ISSUES. PROPERTY ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY YEAH HI THIS IS. DON THIS IS ROBERT YOUNG I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER I HAVE A COUPLE OF PIECES OF DATA REGARDING- CIVIL COME. CIVIL CASES SO IN TERMS OF- DELAYS- ONE SUCH DELAYS IN AROUND CONTINUANCES OF FIRST CIVIL CASES AND CRIMINAL CASES ON AVERAGE- WE SEE- THERE'S A DELAY ON AVERAGE ABOUT. ELEVEN PERCENT. IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUANCES BY AND THEN. WE ALSO SEE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS A LAPSE FROM FILING TO DISPOSITION BOB FOR CIVIL UNLIMITED CASES HI THERE THAT INCREASE THEIR- BY ABOUT EIGHTEEN PERCENT- AND WE SEE THAT VARYING THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE'S- NOT. CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE IT VARIES BUT ON AVERAGE. THE- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING. AND THERE A DAY. RECORD OF HOW I MEET WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THESE DELAYS AND MITIGATE THEM. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS- A SET OF PROPOSALS- THAT WOULD SUPPORT- MANY PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE- EARLY PANDEMIC DISPOSITION CALENDAR- WE'VE GOT- SOME PROGRAMS IN THERE THAT WOULD SUPPORT REMOTE HEARINGS- AND SO SOME OF THOSE WILL HELP OUT WITH THE DOLLARS. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES MISTER LUCKY NUMBERS ARE STILL. YEAH JUST REAL BRIEFLY IT APPEARS THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH'S BUDGET WITH THIS YEAR'S ADDITIONAL SEVENTY TWO POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS PAIRED WITH LAST YEAR'S ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX POINT NINE. A MILLION LEAVES THE COURT FOR THE PROXIMAL A ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT. AND WHAT THAT DIVERSITY SUSTAINED IN TWENTY TWENTY CUTS TO THE COURTS WHY IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S TOP PRIORITY TO EXPAND TO MAKE FUNDING PERMANENT. FOUR TWO PILOT PROGRAMS. EVERY FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FLEKKEN. IF YOU NEED FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL FINANCE IF I MAY ASK. FOR THE ABILITY TO PAID PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING. NO YEAH YES ACTUALLY IT IS. OKAY AND SOON OUR PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE TARGETED FINING KEY RELIEF TO INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE A CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF WHICH SUPERIOR WHAT RICK REGARDLESS OF WHICH COUNTY THEY ARE IN IN IN THE PROPOSAL IS ON A TIERED APPROACH I STARTED WITH TWELVE STARTING WITH JUST OVER TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN IT'S ON A PHASED IN APPROACH WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SET ASIDE IN THE ONGOING YEARS TO ROLL OUT TO MORE COURTS ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS- AND THEN FOR THE SECOND HIGHWAY I WAS- TRYING TO GET WHICH ONE YEAR THAT'S WHAT YOUR DRESSING WITHOUT. I DON'T REMEMBER. WHAT IS IT SELF HELP SELF HELP. OKAY TO SELF HELP WAS A NEW ISSUE INCLUDING THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AS A LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND THAT IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END THE CURRENT YEAR THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WOULD EXTEND THIS FUNDING ON GOING IN THIS FUNDING GOES TO SUPPORT OVER MILLION INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR WITH THROUGH CRITICAL SELF HELP ISSUES WHICH HAVE ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. SO WE'RE REALLY WE'RE SEEKING TO CONTINUE THE NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS- EACH YEAR IN AN ONGOING BASIS. OKAY THANK YOU MR STONE. THANK YOU OF IT I THINK JUST SOME GENERAL COMMENTS AS OPPOSED TO QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE TOUCHING ON A LOT OF THINGS WITH THIS ISSUE AND THEN THE THREE PANELS THAT ARE COMING UP WITH ISSUE NUMBER TWO AS WELL. AND WHAT THE PANDEMIC HAS REALLY SHOWN IS THAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COURTS AS I THINK WE SHOULD STRIVE FOR. AARON WE'VE BUILT OVER THE YEARS A BUDGET FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR THAT THE COURT SYSTEM. THAT IT HAS BEEN BASED ON KIND OF BUILDING UP FINES AND FEES AND MAY HAVING MADE OTHER DECISIONS THAT. THAT SHOW TO BE FAIRLY SUSPECT NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SORT THROUGH HOW TO LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND I LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS. AND YES WE NEED SELF HELP. AND I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THE WORK AROUND THE ABILITY TO PAY AS WELL AS THE RELIANCE ON FINES AND FEES. REALLY SHOW THE THAT WE'VE BUILT. REVENUES FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CUTTING IN THE WRONG WAY IT'S ALSO HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH THE- REMOTE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS PIECE OF THE TRAILER BILL HERE WITHOUT. ALL OF US HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT THAT THE PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON OUR COURTS D. TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEES ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HELD A HEARING NOT LONG AGO. THAT WAS TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE CIVIL LEGAL SYSTEM HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT SHOWS. IS THAT THE ANSWER ABOUT ACCESS IS VERY VERY DIFFERENT COURT TO COURT AND THE COURTS DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION OF WHY HOW THAT'S WORKING OR WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO ABOUT IT. AND MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES SENATE AND ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEES EXPRESS A GREAT DEAL OF WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE COURTS TO FUND TO DO THE RIGHT KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY BUT WE LEFT AS HE THAT HEARING. NOT SURE OF WHAT DIRECTION WE SHOULD BE GOING SO IF THIS IS THESE THREE BUDGET PROPOSALS IS ALL THERE IS. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE MORE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT MAY BE COMING OUT FROM JUDICIAL BRANCH BUT IF THIS IS REALLY ALL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE ARE TRULY WOEFULLY SHORT. OF A BROAD SOLUTION OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT ACCESS WE HAVE VERY INCONSISTENT STANDARDS. COURT THE COURT AND IT SEEMS EVEN COURTROOM TO COURTROOM BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUAL JUDGES. DECISIONS OF WHAT THEY'RE WILLING TO DO OR NOT DO AROUND THE PANDEMIC AND AROUND ACCESS AND SO THAT LACK OF CONSISTENCY I THINK. UNDERMINES THIS NOTION OF BROAD ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I DON'T REALLY SEE ENOUGH HEAR OR UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO WITH THESE PIECES IF WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE THE BROADER ACCESS ISSUE. THROUGH THE PANDEMIC BUT ALSO AFTER THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THOSE SAME. WEAKNESSES IN THE SYSTEM AND THE WAY WE FUNDED TRIAL COURTS. STILL EXIST EXISTED BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND THEY ARE GOING TO EXIST AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO I'M KEEP HOPING THAT WE COULD WORK WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL THAT YOU DISCUSS WOULD WORK WITH US. IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEIR NEEDS REALLY ARE AND HOW WE RE THINK THE SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE SOME STRONGER CONSISTENCY. AMONG ALL OF THE COURTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON V. THE ISSUE OF THE COURT FACILITIES FUNDING TO I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT THE L. A. L. IS RECOMMENDING THAT WE BRING THAT INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND- BECAUSE OF THESE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDING THE CORE CONSTRUCTION ANYWAY HAVE BEEN. IN THE PAST BROUGHT INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHEN THE STATE WAS IN FISCAL CRISIS THAT YOU SHOWS THAT THE SORT OF FUNGIBILITY OF THOSE FUNDS. THESE OF THE GENERAL FUND SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST SORT OF DROPPED THE PRETENSE. DEAL WITH THAT BUT THEN THAT ALSO GIVES AND IT SHOULD GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME BETTER INPUT AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE LONG TERM PLANS ARE A LOT OF THE- PLANS THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS WORKING ON FOR COURT. CONSTRUCTION CORPS FACILITIES IS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS OLD AND THIS IS COME UP IN THIS COMMITTEE. A NUMBER OF TIMES SO FOR US TO HAVE SOME STRONGER OVERSIGHT IN THE DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE WHAT COURTS. FACILITIES NEED TO BE MADE AND WHAT WAS. PART OF A DECISION TWENTY YEARS AGO ISN'T NECESSARILY THE SAME WE WOULDN'T SO TO COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION NOW SO FOR. THE COURTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN MOVING FORWARD I THINK THAT'S FINE. BUT COURTS OTHER COURT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. ADDRESSING THE CURRENT NEEDS. OF WHERE THOSE FACILITIES NEED TO BE BUILT. SO THAT WE HAVE A- AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT WE KNOW WHERE THOSE FACILITIES ARE GOING TO GO IN AND THAT THEY'RE GOING INTO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM THE MOST RATHER THAN JUST WHAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BOOKS. FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. SO FOR US TO BRING THOSE. THESE PARTS OF MONIES INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND THE LEGISLATURE. HAVE INSIGHT AND OVERSIGHT OVER THE DECISION SICK IT MADE AND WHAT THE PIPELINE IS I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE. SO THERE'S A LOT THERE'S THIS KIND OF INTER TWINED IN WHAT I JUST SAID THA HAVE TO DO WITH THIS ISSUE. AND WITH THE WITH THE NEXT ISSUES COMING UP. BUT IT'S I WILL TELL YOU IT'S JUST HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW. ALL OF THIS. RELATES AND HOW WE WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND. A SINGLE BUDGET THIS YEAR FOR THE COURT SYSTEM. AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMICS AND I WOULD I HOPE. AND I WAS SPEAKING FOR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S AND I WAS THE NOT THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEES. WHEN WE OFFERED SOME HELP IN THE INTEGRATIVE WILLINGNESS TO LOOK AT FISCALLY WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP THE COURTS. ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF ACCESS THAT THEY NEED AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. BUT SO FAR WHAT I'VE WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM THE COURTS. I JUST LEASE BECAUSE SCRATCHING MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THESE PROPOSALS. THEY'RE NOT COMPREHENSIVE. AND WE'RE AGAINST WHAT OF PIECE MEALING OUT HOW WE DEAL WITH THE COURTS BUDGET. AS OPPOSED TO GETTING OUR HANDS AROUND. THE BIGGER PICTURE. SO CONSISTENCY IN BUDGETING CONSISTENCY IN ACCESS CONSISTENCY COURT TO COURT AND COURTROOM TO COURTROOM. TO ANSWER SOME OF THE- THE ACCESS ISSUES AND THEN CONSISTENCY IN. IN FUNDING AND HOW WE ADDRESS THAT IN. REDUCING THE RELIANCE OF THE COURTS FUNDING ON THE FINES AND FEES. AND THIS KIND OF EXTERNAL STRUCTURE. THAT LEADS TO THINGS LIKE NEEDING TO DO THE ABILITY TO PAY EXPANSION PILOT PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE WE'VE BUILT A SYSTEM WHERE THE POOREST OF CALIFORNIANS WHO RUN AFOUL OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. OUR REALLY DOUBLY PENALIZED BECAUSE THE WE HAVE STACKED SO MANY ADD ONS TO THE FINES THAT THEY'RE GETTING WE WERE ADDING ALL OF THESE FEES. THAT IT IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LANDING ON THOSE WHO REALLY CANNOT AFFORD IT. THAT'S WHAT THESE PROPELLER PROGRAMS ARE ABOUT SO I THINK. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TAKING A BROADER LOOK AT COURTS FUNDING GETTING THEM THE FUNDING THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE MECHANISMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE OVER THE YEARS TO COBBLE TOGETHER. A COURTS FUNDING SYSTEM BUT WE NEED TO JUST CANCEL WORK WITH US ON THIS WE NEED REALLY BETTER RELATIONSHIPS AND BETTER INFORMATION MOVING BETWEEN. JUDICIAL BRANCH. THE BUDGET SUBS AS WELL AS THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THE POLICY OVERSIGHT. OVER THOSE COMMITTEES AND THEN REALLY GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE COURTS. NEED TO BE DOING AND HOW WE CAN BE HELPING THEM THROUGH THIS BUDGET CYCLE PUT IN PLACE THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND NOT DO IT SORT OF PIECEMEAL LIKE THIS. SO I HAVE ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS OTHER THAN HELP US OUT TO HELP US FIGURE OUT. HOW WE CAN HELP YOU GET SOME OF THESE DONE BUILD SOME CONSISTENCY BACK. IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE ON A CONSISTENT MANNER ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT QUARTS. A. N. AND HAVING A MORE RATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT. WHAT THE BUDGETS REALLY BUT THE-BUDGETARY NEEDS ARE HOW WE FUND THEM- INSTEAD OF. WHAT HAS BEEN COBBLED TOGETHER OVER THE YEARS SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HOPING WE CAN START TO DO A BETTER JOB OF. THIS YEAR COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC IS PANDEMIC IS REALLY SHOWING THE WEAKNESSES IN HOW WE'VE ADDRESS COURT FUNDING. OVER THE YEARS. THANK YOU YOUR SON I SAY WELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A QUESTION MAYBE- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND JUDICIAL COUNCIL COULD. COMMENT ON THE L. A. O.'S PROPOSAL TOOK- TO MOVE EVERYTHING INTO THE GENERAL FUND IF KNOWING THAT WITH THESE PLANS ARE GOING TO BECOME AND ALL THAT. AND KNOWING THAT WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A MORE JUST SYSTEM THAT LOCKS AWAY FROM. THE SYSTEM WHERE A HUNDRED DOLLAR BASE FEE FOR A PARKING TICKET. THAT BEING ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS A BATTERED ALMOST THIRTY. FIVE ADD ONS. FROM THE CHART I'M TRYING TO BE. POSSIBLE CAN YOU GUYS COME IN AND THAT. I JUST REMIND APARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANTED TO ADDRESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONES A CALM IN REGARDS TO FUND CONSOLIDATION. OUR GOAL OF FUND CONSOLIDATION WAS TO AVOID A GENERAL FUND OBLIGATION IN THE BUDGET YEAR SINCE THE STFC AT THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND WAS GOING TO BE INSOLVENT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. IF WE LEFT IT ALONE AND THEN ALSO TO YOUR POINT IN REGARDS TO CONSISTENCY WE WERE SEEKING A CONSISTENT SO LUCIEN NOT ONLY FOR THESE CORE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS BUT ALSO THE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS. BUT THE TRIAL COURT TRUST FUND IN TO HAVE A SOLUTION WHERE WHAT WE DECIDE TO DO WITH THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND ANY IMMEDIATE CRITICAL NEED TO COUNT. SOMETHING SIMILAR THAT WE DO FOR THE OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS- I'M- SO IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THAT FURTHER- WE CAN I JUST I WAS TRYING. TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP. THIS JUDICIAL COUNCIL ON AT ANYTHING. SISTERLY ADAM BARRINGER MEAN IN TERMS OF THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND AND THE IN A MEETING CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT MERGER AND OUR FOCUS IS ON ENSURING THAT THE FUNDS TO THE TO THOSE TO THOSE NEEDS IN TERMS OF OUR STAFF. THE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM THE DEBT SERVICE ARE MAINTAINED AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO GO POSITION ON THE FINAL FINAL SOLUTION BUT RATHER JUST ENSURING THAT OUR PROGRAM IS FULLY FUNDED. THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER BENNETT SAYS I'M SORRY I'M- THIS IS A ROBERT- YEAH. CAN I ADDRESS- THE QUESTION ABOUT THE LARGER PICTURE AROUND THE- JUDICIAL BRANCHES PLAN PLEASE DO. A TERRIFIC STYLE- I JUST WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT OUR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS BEEN FOLLOWING A PLANT BASED ON THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S. XS THREE D. VISION SO THAT'S PHYSICAL REMOTE AND EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND SO EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IS REALLY BASED ON THAT STRATEGIC PLAN TO MOVE TOWARDS PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND PROVIDING EQUITY. THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET PLAN. IS ONE STEP TOWARDS REALIZING THAT. ENDPOINT DIVISION- THIS PARTICULAR PLAN INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF MODERNIZATION OVER TWO YEARS THIS WILL BE THE SECOND YEAR THAT WILL BE RECEIVING THAT I'D INCLUDES THE PANDEMIC EARLY DISPOSITION CALENDARING PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR SELF HELP THAT YOU'VE HEARD. ONLINE TRAFFIC A COMMUNICATIONS AND THOSE ARE ALL PIECES- OTHER MUCH BIGGER PLAN DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THE LEGISLATURE'S PLANS TO INCREASE EQUITY- AN ACCESS ROUTE THE STATE AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. TOGETHER TO LOOK AT- HOW WE CAN ENHANCE AND UP WITH A CREATE MORE UNIFORMITY WITHIN THOSE SERVICES BUT WE DO HAVE AN OVERALL PLAN AND IT'S FOCUSED ON- ACCESS TO JUSTICE. THANK YOU WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING SOME ARE THOSE DETAILS MISTER JONES SAWYER- YOU KNOW- WHEN I CAME IN A TWENTY TWELVE- I WAS CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE. COMPACTORS MY FIRST CHAIRMANSHIP. AND DURING THAT TIME. THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE COURT CONSTRUCTION FUND- AT THE TIME WE'VE GONE TO RECESSION. AND- WE BORROWED TRY TO BE TO MONEY TO BALANCE THE BUDGET OUR VERY HARD TO TRY TO RESTORE ALL OF THAT MONEY. BUT IN THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE DAN AOC ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE OF THE COURTS. IT BECAME CLEAR EARLY ON- IN MY TENURE. THAT B. B. A. R. C. AND THE COURTS REALLY PLAYING. WE NEITHER ONE OF US KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE COURT FUNDING- WHEN THINGS WOULD GET DONE HUMMING PROJECT COULDN'T GET DONE. HOW MANY PROJECTS WERE ON SCHEDULE WHICH ONES HADN'T EVEN BEEN STARTED. AND AS WE STARTED TO DIG IN AND DAY AGAIN AND TRY TO GET. SOME SPECIFIC IDEA OF HOW TAXPAYERS MONIES ARE BEING USED. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY YEAR OR TWO YEARS- THE MINISTRY OF OFFICE THE COURT WAS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR CONSTRUCTION WITHOUT A REAL PLAN FOR HOW TO GET THINGS DONE IN ADDITION AT THE SAME TIME IF I REMEMBER BACK THEN- DLC WAS TALKING. CLOSING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE. WHERE A MOTHER WHO HAD A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CLAIM. HAD TO GET ON A BUS A HUNDRED MILES AWAY TO GET A RESTRAINING ORDER. AND THEY WANTED TO CLOSE THE CLOSEST COURT TODAY AT THAT MOMENT. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- THE PLANTED KIND OF BRING EVERYTHING IN. AND ALSO TAKEN AWAY FROM THE COURT BACK THEN I BELIEVE THE PJ'S TO PRESIDING JUDGES. HEAD UP HEAVY HEAVY HAND IN DECIDING HOW COURT CONSTRUCTION WITH BUILDINGS AND WHAT WOULD BE DONE- I THINK EARLY ON WE REALIZED THAT WAS A HUGE HUGE MISTAKE. AND I WILL TELL YOU AS SOMEONE. WHO DID CONSTRUCTION FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WHEN WE ALLOW L. A. P. D. THE BILL POLICE STATIONS- IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE AND ALMOST EVERY PROJECT CAME IN- OVER BUDGET AND RARELY DID WE GET THEM DONE ON TIME BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT A POLICE OFFICER'S CORE CONFIDENCE JUST LIKE IT'S NOT A JUDGE'S CORE COMPETENCE TO DO FACILITIES MANAGEMENT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OR EVEN TO BE RESPONSIBLE. FOR A PROJECT MANAGEMENT OF A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT AND SO WE TOOK THAT OUT OF THEIR HANDS IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE. BUILDINGS DONE ON TIME UNDER BUDGET. AND MOST OF ALL REPUBLICANS HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY WHERE IN POLICE STATIONS YOU WOULD HAVE. ONE POLICE CAPTAIN BILL THE TAJ MAHAL. OFFICE AND ANOTHER ONE WITH BUILDING A FAIRLY MODEST AND IT WAS NO CONSISTENCY AND THAT'S WHY THEY CAME IN- NOT IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE FOR USING TAXPAYER MONEY. UP TO WHAT WE LEARNED IN THE CITY IS YOU NEED TO BRING. THIS WHOLE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN HOUSE. GET SOME PROFESSIONALS THAT ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MANAGEMENT. SO THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH THE BEST PLAN. TO GET THE FACILITIES DONE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE SPECIALLY. FOR LOW INCOME AND MINORITY. AMENITIES IS BASED OFF OF WHERE THEY CAN GO TO A- AND I DON'T WE'RE- IT ON DAT. AS OPPOSED TO A PATIENT ON THE CAN. OF A PARTICULAR PJ ARE JUDGED. TO GET TO A COURT. AND IS NOT BASED ON WHAT AT NOT IS TO BEST FOR THE RESIDENTS IN THAT AREA. AND SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE US HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE WE ALSO NEED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. YOU CAN I JUST FEEL LIKE WE DESTROY. IN A LOT OF WAYS AND I KNOW WE HAVE NOW DID. COUNCIL BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT FULLY GOTTEN OUR HANDS AROUND THIS. IS A LOT OF MONEY I MEAN THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED TO MOVE ON. WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON WHAT WE WILL AND WON'T DO. WHAT WE WILL AND WE'LL FIND. ABBOTT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND ANYMORE. ARE NOT HOLDING OVER TO HEAD OF THE- OF THE ASSEMBLY GOVERNOR OFFICE. THAT YES WE STARTED THIS BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP GIVING US MORE MORE MONEY YOU GOT TO KEEP RAISING THE PIECE OF THE PAPER. AND YOU'VE A KEY. FUNDING OUR INABILITY TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS IN A SUBSTANTIVE WAY. AND IT AND SO I BELIEVE THAT THE L. A. L. HAS AS MERRICK. AND WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I THINK WE SHOULD WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. SERVING I TO HIRE SOME OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. ON HOW WE TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM- AND YOUR WE GET A TWO DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES OR WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE BUILDINGS- TO ENSURE THAT. WE HAVE THE BEST. OUTCOME THE MOST IMPORTANT MADE THE BEST USE OF. TAXPAYER MONEY AS WE MOVE FORWARD FROM HERE. FIVE I CAME IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. THESE ISSUES THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY IN THESE ISSUES ARE SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THESE ISSUES ARE STILL HERE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO. WE'VE GOT TO WE'VE GOT TO REFERENCE ON TO ROUND THIS AND GET THIS DONE. AND I DON'T HONEST YOU MEAN. WE NEVER WANT TO SEE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN WE NEED TO HAVE BOOKS ARE MOVING TOWARD A SOLUTION. AND I THINK THE BEST WAY IF THE LEGISLATURE THREE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. IS A BRING THOSE FUNDS IN. SO THAT WE CAN GET. THE COURTS TO HELP THEY NEED- TO BETTER UTILIZE THAT. THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER JONES SAWYER. MATT MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST BRIEFLY RESPOND- YES- VERY COULD I WOULD DEFINITELY WANT OFFER A OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WITH THE STAFF OF THE MEMBERSHIP ON. SORT OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHICH WE GO THROUGH- ARE PROGRAM BUT I NEEDED OVER TO BECAUSE MY MCCORMICK I THINK DESCRIBED REASSESSMENT PROCESS AND THE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HOUSING- NOT FIVE YEARS FOR OF- PROPOSAL IN THE- INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN- BUT DEFINITELY WILL TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S AWARE OF WHAT DOING AND WE ARE WE'RE CLASS. WITH THE MINISTRY ANALYSTS ON OUR SOCIETY NEEDS SO WE CAN WORK WITH TO THE HAVE THAT'S. OKAY. THANK YOU FOR OTHER QUESTIONS COME FROM OMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THEN GONNA MOVE ARTIST NUMBER TWO IS YOU KNOW TWO HEY THREE SUB PANELS TO THE FOR SUB PANEL ONE IS ON HOW THE SELF HELP CENTER AND WE HAVE HOW JUDICIAL COUNCIL I NEED TO L. A. L. L. JESSE WERE FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE. IT WAS CHAD ALL THE INTERNET. I'M I WILL. THE NEXT ISSUE IS RELATED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. TERMINATE NINETY ONE MILLION DOLLAR OF COULD. SERVER THAT WERE FOR THE EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT AND IT SAID WE HAVE TWENTY HEALTH. IN THIS REQUEST IS TO CONTINUE THE NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION IN FUNDING FOR COURT BASED SELF HELP CENTERS THIS MISTER MY DESCRIBED. OVER 95% OF THE FUNDS ARE USED FOR ATTORNEYS AND PARALEGALS TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND EDUCATION FOR PEOPLE WITHOUT LAWYERS ABOUT THE COURT PROCESS. HELP THEM COMPLETE THEIR NECESSARY COURT DOCUMENTS AND PREPARE FOR THEIR HEARINGS. EACH COURT IN CALIFORNIA HAS A SELF HELP CENTER DEDICATED TO ASSISTING THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO COME TO COURT EACH YEAR WITHOUT A LAWYER. THESE FUNDS ALLOWED COURTS TO DOUBLE THEIR STAFF SO THERE ARE NOW THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX ATTORNEYS AND PARALEGALS HELPING PEOPLE EVERY DAY WITH THEIR LEGAL PROBLEMS. AND 46% OF THOSE WHO STAFF ARE BILINGUAL. COURTS WERE ALSO ABLE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF LOCATIONS WHERE SERVICES WERE OFFERED TO MAKE IT MORE CONVENIENT TO THE PUBLIC. SO WE NOW HAVE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE SELF HELP CENTER SITES. AND THEY UPGRADED THEIR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SO THEY WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY MOVED PROVIDING REMOTE SERVICES SUCH AS VIDEO CONFERENCING AND LIVE CHAT DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SELF HELP CENTERS PROVIDED SERVICES TO OVER A MILLION IN PERSON AND REMOTE PRISONERS. AND A RECENT JUSTICE GAP STUDY BY THE STATE BAR FOUND THAT 16% OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. WHO RECEIVE LEGAL ASSISTANCE GET IT FROM COURT A SELF HELP CENTERS. WELL CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SURVEYS SHOW THAT OVER 96% OF THE PEOPLE COMING TO SELF HELP WE'RE VERY SATISFIED WITH THE SERVICES. THEY ALSO REPORTED A NEED FOR MORE STAFF ADDITIONAL HOURS AND SHORTER WAIT TIMES FOR SERVICE APPOINTMENTS. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROVIDED A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WHICH LOOK CAREFULLY AT HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES ARE NEEDED FOR DIFFERENT CASE TYPES AND THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. THE PANDEMIC FOR MEDICALLY AFFECTED THOUGH SERVICE MODALITIES NEEDS ARE CHANGING QUICKLY. FOR EXAMPLE SELF HELP CENTERS WERE ASSISTING WITH 22% OF THE LANDLORD TENANT CASES FILED IN CALIFORNIA. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE NUMBERS WILL INCREASE AS THE EVICTION MORATORIUM ARE LEFT DEAD. TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CONTINUES TO COLLECT DATA AND CONVENES WEEKLY WEBINARS WITH SELF HELP STAFF TO KEEP THEM ABREAST OF CHANGES IN THE LAW AS WELL AS TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND PROVIDING SERVICES. AS CENTERS CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WITH ON TO SERVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. ESCORTS COME UP WITH NEW INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS TRANSLATIONS WAYS OF PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. THEIR SHARED QUICKLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WE DEEPLY THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THIS PROJECT WHICH HELPS SO MANY PEOPLE GET ACCESS TO THE COURTS. PARTICULARLY AT THIS TIME WE KNOW THE NEED CONTINUES TO GROW. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU L. L. ANNUALLY WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ITEM FOR- LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT BUDGET TRAILER LEGISLATION DIRECTING JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO CONTRACT WITH AN EXTERNAL RESEARCHER TO FINISH THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THAT WAS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET. AND TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW FUNDING CAN BE ALLOCATED BY DELIVERY METHOD AND HE'S TIED TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND TO THE COURT I NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AS OF THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET SPECIFICALLY DIRECTED OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO COMPLETE OR TO CONTRACT WITH A RESEARCHER TO COMPLETE A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN TIME FOR THIS YEAR'S BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. THE REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED EARLIER THIS YEAR HAD A LOT OF HOPEFUL OUTCOME DATA AND REFLECTED EXTENSIVE JUDICIAL BRANCH EFFORT AT COLLECTING INFORMATION HOWEVER INCOMPLETE BECAUSE IT MISSES THE FINAL KEY PIECES OF A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY CALCULATING THE MONETARY VALUE OF IDENTIFIED BENEFITS IDENTIFYING CORRESPONDING COSTS AND IDENTIFYING THE NET BENEFIT OF THE VARIOUS SELF HELP DELIVERY METHODS BY CASE TYPE. AND SO WITHOUT THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE WHAT TOTAL LEVEL FUNDING IS WARRANTED AND HOW ANY PROVIDED FUNDING COULD BE MAXIMIZED- TO SERVE THE MOST INDIVIDUALS. IN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY POSSIBLE. OUR SECOND RECORD. IN LINE WITH OUR FIRST ONE THE DUE DATE FOR THIS FINISHING UP THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDING FOR ONLY AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS. THIS WOULD PREVENT A REDUCTION IN SERVICE LEVELS AND HELP MAINTAIN ALL OF THE EQUITY RELATED BENEFITS THAT COME FROM THESE SERVICES WALL THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS BEING FINISHED. AND THEN FINALLY WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ADOPTING PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO SPECIFY ITS PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF SELF HELP CENTER FUNDING. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER SPECIFYING THAT A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING BE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES REMOTELY AND THIS COULD BE BENEFICIAL ON AN ONGOING BASIS BOTH DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE. FURTHER AWAY FROM THE COURT AND SO IT POBABLY WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THEM TO HAVE TO TRAVEL THE COURTSTO OBTAIN THE SERVICES IF THEY WERE AVAILABLE REMOTELY. THANK YOU ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU THE FORMER FINANCE. JESSICA MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN REGARDS TO THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION FOR LIMITED THERE WERE FUNDING I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT CONTINUED INVESTMENT SELF HELP SERVICES BEYOND TWO YEARS IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS ESPECIALLY SINCE THE ONSET COOKING NINETEEN THAT'S EXACERBATED ISSUES FOR UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS EVEN MORE CRITICAL HOUSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FAMILY LAW IN OTHER SIMILAR ISSUES WERE INDIVIDUALS. NEED HELP AS LAID OUT IN THE DATA IT WAS PROVIDED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THESE RESOURCES FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF OVER ONE MILLION SELF REPRESENTED INDIVIDUALS ARE YOU THIS MORNING IS NOT CONTINUE ATTORNEY ATTORNEY WILL BE LAID OFF EXISTING SERVICE LEVELS. WILL BE WILL BE TEAMING WITH THE CLIENT AND THEY'LL BE REDUCE CAPACITY TO HELP INDIVIDUALS CONCERNING CRITICAL CIVIL ISSUES I ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT A PLUS BENEFIT ANALYSIS CAN BE A HELPFUL TOOL TO GUIDE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE AND RECONSIDER FUTURE INVESTMENTS IN SELF HELP SERVICES. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMING OF THIS ANALYSIS IN PARTICULAR WE ARE CONCERNED THAT ANALYSIS CONDUCTED IT'S TIME WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC I CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS OUT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE GOING TO DRASTIC CHANGES IN THE WAY THEY ARE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO COURT USERS DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY IF A COST BENEFIT STUDY WOULD BE COMPLETED IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND MAY NOT BE HELPFUL IN THE FUTURE SINCE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE- ADMINISTRATION OF SELF HELP SERVICES. IS CHANGING ITS CUT BY THE PENTAGON. AS FOR THE- PROVISION LANGUAGE. THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTY SAN COURT EACH CASE. HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS ON SPECIFIC POPULAR. AS SUCH DIMINISH. SUPPORTS THAT SUPPORTS. COURTS HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES BASED ON THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THEIR QUARTERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE AND SO FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND- I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT DOING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS NOW BUT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN DONE. SO THAT WE COULD UNDERSTAND. AND WHAT THE OVERALL COST WE'RE GOING TO BE WHAT THE FUTURE. OF THE. SELF HELP CENTERS REALLY AREN'T AND HOW WE GET OUR HEADS AROUND WHAT THAT FINANCING IS I ABSOLUTELY AGREE HOW IMPORTANT HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT SELF HELP CENTERS ARE AS WE'RE SEEING SUCH AN INCREASE IN IN SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. REALLY ACROSS THE STATE SO HOW. DO WE- YES L. A. O. HAS A GOOD POINT THAT THAT WORK ON A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WAS NOT COMPLETED AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM ABOUT PROVIDING JUST A COUPLE YEARS OF FUNDING. AND DOING SOME PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO NEED. IF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR IS. MORE CERTAINTY IN THE IN THE FUNDING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS OR AT LEAST BEYOND THE TWO YEARS. L- I AM HAPPY TO START THAT AT THIS POINT WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR CONTINUATION OF THE FUNDING ASSETS WERE NOT ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. AND THE CHALLENGE IS AS I SAY THE WE COLLECTED DATA IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA WAS RECORDED- IN- UP IN THE COST BENEFIT REPORT. AND ALL OF THOSE SERVICES HAVE DRIVEN FOR MEDICALLY CHANGED AS WELL AS- THE IMPACT ON THE COURTS SO- REVIEWING PAPERS- TAKES A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF TIME WHEN IT'S BEING DONE ELECTRONICALLY- ALL KINDS OF THINGS ARE JUST DIFFERENT. AND ANY DATA THAT WE'RE USING IS- GOING TO BE FAIRLY CHALLENGING IN TERMS OF REALLY MAKING THOSE DIRECTIONS MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE AS HONESTLY POINTS HOW MANY OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT WERE. INCORPORATED AS A RESULT OF THE COST OF THE PANDEMIC. MAY WELL BE FABULOUS I MEAN I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING REMOTE SERVICES WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME. WHAT THAT MAKES IS GOING TO BE LIKE WHEN THE PANDEMIC IS OVER AND SO. IT IS. CRITICAL THAT THERE IS FLEXIBILITY IN THE COURTS TO BE AS INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE BUT THEY NEED A BASELINE. SHOULD BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THE ASSISTANCE AND ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO YOU. WITH- MORE INFO ABOUT ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. THAT THERE IS IT LEASED THE NINETEEN BILLION DOLLAR NEED AND THEN MOVING FORWARD HOW ARE WE GOING% TO DO THAT BUT AT THIS TIME I THINK IT IS- AS- A MYSTERY BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THAT RIGHT MIX OF SERVICES IS GOING TO BE. OKAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE- A COUPLE COMMENTS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL FROM THE L. A- IF IT. WOULD BE HELPFUL PRETTY GOOD NEARLY. I NEARLY WITH THE L. A- SO A COUPLE THINGS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL TO IN TERMS OF YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH DID DO A LOT OF COLLECTION OF DATA. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AS WELL AS NINETEEN TWENTY SO IN CONTRACTING WITH THE RESEARCHER. TO RESEARCHER TO FINISH OFF THAT ANNOUNCES THEY WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF A LOT OF THAT HELPFUL INFORMATION THEY MIGHT NEED TO SUPPLEMENT IT. BUT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF SOME OF THAT INFORMATION SO I THINK ABOUT KIND OF THE FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO- REYES OF KIND OF A COMMENT. THE SECOND ISSUE IS IN IN BOTH THE COMMENTS THAT ARE BEING RAISED BY THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MIX WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE MIX. THAT GOES BACK TO YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT WHY A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS NECESSARY AND IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE LEGISLATURE FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT BECAUSE THAT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED AS PART. OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND SO IN LINE WITH THAT AS WE ARE OPERATING IN THE PANDEMIC THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PRIORITIES WHETHER THERE ARE CERTAIN MINIMUMS. THAT WE WATCH IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE VERY SPECIFIC YOU WILL SPEND X. Y. NZ BUT IT CAN'T INVOLVED SAYING AT THE MINIMUM WE SHOULD BE DEDICATING A CERTAIN AMOUNT THIS AMOUNT. TO THAT DELIVERY AND THAT'S METHOD OR YOU KNOW IN OTHER PRIORITIES OTHER METICULOUSLY BY THE LEGISLATURE SO HOPEFULLY. THAT'S HELPFUL. THAT IS. AND THEN I UNDER. THAT AND THAT'S WE'RE- WE'RE DEFINITELY DEALING WITH SOME DIFFERENCES THIS YEAR. OR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NOT NECESSARILY ALIGNING WITH THE FISCAL YEARS. IN THE LEGISLATURE DID ASK FOR SOME OF THAT INFORMATION THAT WASN'T COMPLETED. THAT MY FRUSTRATION ALSO COMES FROM DAY HEARING THAT WE HELD ON ACCESS TO COURTS WHERE A LOT. THE ANSWER TO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS FROM JUDICIAL COUNCIL WAS WE'RE COLLECTING DATA. WILL COLLECT MORE DATA AT SOME POINT. WE'VE GOT TO GET ACCESS TO THAT DATA TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALL OF THAT MEANS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE HOW WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO JUST CONTINUING THAT MONEY RIGHT THAT'S THAT'S. NOT AN UNREASONABLE ASK AT THIS POINT BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT TO SELF HELP CENTERS ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND WILL BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT INTO THE FUTURE HOW THEY INNOVATE AND HOW THEY PROVIDE. BENEFITS TO. OUR CONSTITUENTS IS REALLY VERY IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS HOW THAT WORKS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THE CORRECT LEVEL OF FUNDING AND I'M ALSO SENSITIVE TO THAT MR REMINDS COMMENT THAT WE A FIFTY EIGHT COURTS AND- WE DON'T WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION IN THOSE COURTS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT. NEEDS AND DIFFERENT PEOPLE YES TO A POINT BUT THIS IS I THINK ALSO WERE WE GET WRAPPED AROUND SOME PROBLEMS HERE IN THAT WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS THAT WANT TO BE VERY INDEPENDENT. AND DO THINGS THEIR OWN WAY WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING. AND IS LEADING TO DIFFERENCES IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE COURT TO COURT TO COURT. AND EVEN SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE GOT IN OUR HEARING PREVIOUSLY. THE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES HAD THAT HEARING ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE THERE SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT RESPONSES FROM COURTROOM TO COURTROOM MEANING DIFFERENT JUDGES WANT TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE SO STRIDENTLY THAT THEY'RE MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS. THAT AFFECT ACCESS SO HOW I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE SUPPORTING SELF HELP CENTERS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THOSE ARE CRITICAL. FOR UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS AND THAT'S A THAT'S ACTUALLY A BIG PROBLEM THAT WE SHOULDN'T JUST PAPER OVER BY SINGLE WE HAVE SELF HELP CENTERS. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO JUSTICE BECAUSE WITHOUT. APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONALS HELPING THEM WITH THE LEGAL SYSTEM THEY ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE. BUT I'M ALSO VERY WORRIED ABOUT. THIS DESIRE TO ALLOW FIFTY EIGHT COURTS TO DO THEIR OWN THING ALL THE TIME WITHOUT SOME CONSISTENCY. ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DO IN FACT HAVE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM. NOT A CONGLOMERATION OF FIFTY EIGHT. DIFFERENT LITTLE FIEFDOMS SO. WE DON'T WANT TO STIFLE INNOVATION WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE SELF HELP CENTERS AND IN IN ALL OF THESE CATEGORIES COURTS ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BUT ALSO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER HOW SOME CONSISTENCY AND HAVE IT LEASED THE MINIMUM STANDARD OF ACCESS ACROSS ALL OF THE COURTS. SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY OR TOO MUCH- OF A AN ALLOWANCE FOR THAT FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COURTS AND HOW NEAT THAT IS THAT THEY ALL HAVE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE. SO I THINK WHAT. IT'S A TOUGH THING FOR US TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY TO DO. THESE OF THE THIS YEAR AND MOVING FORWARD- SO THAT'S NOT FOR ME NOT UNREASONABLE REQUEST AND THE COMMITTEES GOT A KIND OF SORT THROUGH THAT THE NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS- ASK. BUT I DO AGREE WITH ALEJO THAT JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS COLLECTED A LOT OF DATA YOU GOT TO START PUTTING SOME OF THAT TOGETHER. AND MAKE THAT RELATABLE TO US SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT THOSE WHAT THE FUTURE OF THE SELF HELP CENTERS ARE GOING TO BE SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY FUNDED. BECAUSE WHAT OUR HOPE YOU'RE HEARING IS THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE WE ADEQUATELY FUND THOSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE KEY. UNFORTUNATELY TO. REALLY PROVIDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE SORRY- OTHER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. JONES SAWYER AND I THINK WE'RE ALL OF THIS IS NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT- SELF HELP CENTERS ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT I LIKE TO ADD ONE ADDITIONAL UP THEY COULD BE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE. AND ALSO COULD HELP US WITH OUR BRICK AND MORTAR PROBLEM WITH PLANTS IF MORE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GO ONLINE AND ABLE TO HANDLE THEIR JUDICIAL THE CARD BUSINESS ON LINE. THAT WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHOWING UP AT COURT DID DO VERY SIMPLE MENIAL TASKS THAT CAN BE HANDLED- ONLINE. AND THEN INVESTMENT IN THIS IS CRITICAL NOT ONLY FOR DISADVANTAGED AND POOR FOLKS. IT COULD BE THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE THAT COULD TAKE THIS COURT SYSTEM. INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND BEYOND. AND SO. ASKING THAT AFTER TWO YEARS YEAR AND A HALF THAT WE GET INFORMATION TO MAKE CRITICAL DECISIONS ON HOW WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUST GIVE MONEY. BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THAT WE MAY NOT GET FUNDED. AND THE NEXT TWO YEARS AFTER THAT. IN FACT IF YOU'RE AFRAID OF THAT THAT MAKES ME EVEN MORE CONCERNED. IF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE SETTING UP. IS YOUR FREIGHT THAT A. N. N. NOT AN AUDIT BUT A AN EVALUATION OF WHERE YOU'RE GOING- MAY RESULT IN THIS BODY. NOT FINDING YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING IN IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. I'M VERY CONCERNED. THAT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FAITH. THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO SUCH A GOOD JOB. THAT NOT ONLY WILL WE FIND YOU THE NEXT TEN YEARS BECAUSE WILL HAVE EMPIRICAL DATA THAT ACTUALLY PROVES. NOT ONLY YOUR VALIDITY BUT HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING IT- IS A CONCERN. SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. I JUST THINK. THAT THE COURTS JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND OTHERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT COULD NOT ONLY STATEWIDE BE USE BY MAYBE NATIONALLY EVEN INTERNATIONALLY A KEY COULD BE USED IN THE FUTURE IF WE CAN NOW INVEST IN IT. BUT MOST IMPORTANT WE ACTUALLY TWEAK IT TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT IS FUNCTIONING THE WAY WE WANT TO AND SO I YOU KNOW I CAN LOOK. AT AND NOT TRY TO DO A COLLABO ALBUM IF BUT IF SOME REASON TRYING TO DO A COMPILER AND I LIKE TO HEAR FROM BOTH. FINANCE IN LA- DO YOU KIND OF SEE IT THAT WAY THAT WE'RE ALL WE ALL- ONE TO SEE A ROBUST SELF HELP CENTER. AND HOW CAN WE GET THERE. I COMPLY IF YOU DON'T MIND HEARING FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO CONCERNS ABOUT THE- DATA SHOWING THE NEED FOR EXPANDED ASSISTANCE AND I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ THE REPORT BECAUSE I THINK IT PROVIDES. INCREDIBLY HELPFUL INFORMATION THE CERTAINLY HELPFUL FOR ME TO YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S WINTER WORKSHOPS HELPFUL ON WHAT CASE TYPES HOW LONG TWO THIRDS CERTAIN THINGS TAKE WHEN DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO DO ONE ON ONE VERSUS A WORKSHOP AND AS THEY SAY MOVING FORWARD- WE WILL HAVE WILL. ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE THAT WORK- I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE NEED RIGHT NOW AND- IT TAKING THE RESOURCES AWAY FROM THAT WORK IS- IS CERTAINLY CONCERNING BUT I DO THINK I THINK THAT THE REPORT THAT WE PROVIDED- WILL PROVIDE ENORMOUS GUIDANCE MOVING FORWARD AND ABSOLUTELY CONTINUE. THAT WE WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO PROVIDE- AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE- IN THIS NEW THIS NEW WORLD. I NEED. I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A. L. IN LINE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER IS QUESTIONS- WE DO RECOGNIZE THE BENEFIT THAT COMES FROM SELF HELP DOLLARS I THINK THE REAL THEY'RE THE REASON WHY WE TALK ABOUT THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS IN THE NEED FOR IT IS THAT'S WHAT GIVES YOU THE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN PUT DOLLARS TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT FOR INDIVIDUALS HER BEING SERVED AND THERE IS A RECOGNITION THERE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CASE TYPES- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE GUARDIANSHIP OR CONSERVATORSHIP. THAT LEND ITSELF BETTER FOR IN PERSON SERVICE AND THE OTHER CASE TYPES- UNITS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE STARTING OFF WITH FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS THAT MIGHT LEND ITSELF BETTER TOWARDS WORKSHOPS AND TO TALK ABOUT MAXIMIZING THE USE OF RESOURCES WHEN YOU KNOW YOU NEED ONE ON ONE- TO THE BEST OF TIMES FLEXIBLE AND IT'S A RECOGNITION THAT THE LEGISLATURE AS IT'S THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIND A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE THAT THERE IS- ANY NEED AT THAT CONVENTION CUT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIGHER. AND THE DOLLAR VALUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE- IS ABLE TO KIND OF PROVIDE FUNDING FOR AND SO WE REALLY FOCUS ON BASICALLY THAT CLASS BENEFIT ANALYSIS IS REALLY FOCUSED ON HELPING TO MAXIMIZE USE OF EVERY DOLLAR THAT IS PUT IN. FOR SOUTH OF DOLLARS. THANK YOU. MR LACKING WE ARE JUST REAL TO FOLLOW UP- MICHAEL ROOM AT I DO BUT THAT. L. L. SUGGESTION OF A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WOULD WOULD JUST HELP US BECOME WHAT THE VOTERS EXPECT US TO BE IN AND BE GOOD STEWARDS OF- MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE SOME CLARITY AND SOME CONFIDENCE IN MAXIMIZING THAT IMPACT WAS JUST TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ALL THE ONE SIZE FITS ALL IS VERY DIFFICULT BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE. WE NEED TO COLLABORATE AND DISCUSS WITH EACH OTHER TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE BETWEEN FLEXIBILITY AND CONTROL BECAUSE- COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE OFTEN DOESN'T ALLOW US TO MAXIMIZE OUR OUR BEST USE OF FUNDS EITHER SO- I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL PURSUE IN THE FUTURE A MORE DETAILED COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS. THANK YOU- I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PATIENCE WE STARTED A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN EXPECTED- AS WE WERE HEADED THE LAY ON THE FLOOR. AND IT'S SO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS ARE ADJUSTING- TO THE SITUATION AND- WE HAVE SOME CHILDCARE ISSUES ALONG THE WAY AS WELL. AND SO WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE PANELS FOR A SESSION TO ISSUE TWO AND ISSUE THREE. ALL OF THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT SO JUST ASK THAT WE ARE MINDFUL OF TIME ABOUT THAT WE DO COVER THE IMPORTANT TOPICS AND SO WE COULD JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND OKAY WILL APPRECIATE THAT HELP AS WELL. AS THE WEATHER I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE SECOND PIECE OF THIS ISSUE NUMBER TWO THE ABILITY TO PAY EXPANSION. THE PANELISTS MAY BEGIN. YES THANK YOU THIS IS LAW COMPUTER WHICH AGAIN I UNDERSTAND MY A VIDEO MAY NOT BE A BIT CHOPPY SEPTEMBER OFF. ON SELECT ISSUES RELATED TO REQUEST EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM STATEWIDE. GEN CLOSED OF POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GROWING TO FIFTY EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION. TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND RELATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WE HAVE TO JUST A COUNCIL SHELLEY CURRENT. DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE ANOTHER PETTIT ACTIVITIES MISSION TECHNOLOGY. TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SHELLEY CURRENT- DIRECTOR OF THE COUNCIL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE. ATP AS WE CALL IT IS NOW AVAILABLE IN SIX COUNTIES AND WE ARE VERY PLEASED. WITH THE RESULTS TO DATE- WHEN THE LEGISLATURE ORIGINALLY ADOPTED- THE PILOTS ARE REQUIRED THAT THE TOOL RECOMMEND AT LEAST A 50% REDUCTION. IN THE AMOUNT THE CONSUMERS WHAT I'LL COURTS FOLLOW BITTROLFF RECOMMENDATION MOST THE TIME WAS 70% OF THE REDUCTIONS BEING WITHIN TEN DOLLARS OF THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT. THE AVERAGE REDUCTION IS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. AND THIS SAVES THE AVERAGE LOW INCOME USER SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH EACH TICKET. A TO PAY ALSO ADDRESSES THE PROBLEMS OF LICENSE SUSPENSIONS AN ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT FOR MANY YEARS. USING ATP COUNTS AS AN APPEARANCE OF USERS AVOID FAILURE TO APPEAR CITATION. WITH SUBSEQUENT LICENSE HOLES AND NO SIMPLE ASSESSMENTS. IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS HEARING WE RAN SOME DATA THIS MORNING AND AS OF THIS MORNING. NEARLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND REQUESTS WERE APPROVED FROM OVER TWELVE THOUSAND BUT AGAINST. APPROXIMATELY 92% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIVE OVER. 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. I USERS LIKE THE TOOL WITHOUT THE TOOL LITIGANTS SHOW UP TO COURT PASS THROUGH THE- IN THE AMOUNT OF. THIS ADDS TO THE COST THROUGH OF WORK CHILDCARE. OR TRENDS. WHEN WE DO THE TOOL WE RECEIVED FROM SEVERAL REPRESENTATIVES OF LOW INCOME ADVOCATES THE WESTERN CENTER EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER. DANGEROUS THE ENCOURAGED US TO ENSURE THAT THE TOOL IS READILY ACCESSIBLE SO WE BUILT THE TOOL TO WORK ON DESKTOPS LAPTOPS AND SMARTPHONES. WHICH WAS AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH WE SERVICE USERS AND OVER 90% OF RESPONDENTS FELT THAT THE ABILITY TO PAY TOOL WAS HELPFUL. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION ASKING EXACTLY WHAT FACTORS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO COME TO COURT IN PERSON. MAJORITY FUNDED THE TAKING TIME OFF WORK AND FINDING. TRANSPORTATION WITH THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. CONCERNS WITH THE PURPLE HAS RAISED. IN ALTERNATIVE FOR NUMBER. CIVIL SO AND BEEN SUGGESTED SO WE GOT-BACK LOOKED AT THE DATA DEVELOPED BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL MIGHT BE. AND THERE ARE TWO ITEMS THAT I CAN HIGHLIGHT IS AND ASK IF YOU CONSIDER. FIRST I WANT TO NOTE THAT IF THE PROPOSAL WERE TO GO FORWARD. LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO RESPOND TO THEIR TICKETS ON TIME WOULD RECEIVE NO BENEFIT. ACCORDING TO OUR DATA OVER 50% OF ATG REQUESTED FOR APPROVAL INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM. I'M EXCITATIONS WITHOUT THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT REDUCTION WAS. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DOLLARS. IF EIGHTY P. OR ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF A LIMITED MUSICAL ASSESSMENT. THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD RECEIVE NO BENEFIT. SECOND A SERVICEMAN IS NOT NECESSARILY AN INDICATOR OF POVERTY. WELL CERTAINLY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN CIVIL ASSESSMENT BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO PAY. NOT EVERYONE WHO GETS A SIMPLE ASSESSMENT IS NECESSARILY LOW INCOME. SO WE HOPE THAT YOU'LL APPROVED THIS PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TARGETED PROGRESSIVE RELIEF TO THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. MAY BE ELIGIBLE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SPEAKER DELEO- ANNUALLY WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU ON THIS ITEM- FIRST WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CANCEL THE PILOT AND THE CURRENTLY REQUIRED EVALUATION AND EXPAND THE POOL STATEWIDE- AND THIS IS BECAUSE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF PROCESS OF BEING ROLLED OUT SUCH AS ONLINE TRIALS- THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT AND BEING TESTED IN THE SPRING AND SO THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON COSTS. ADDITIONALLY AND EVALUATION OF A COMPLETED PILOT IS REALLY HELPFUL TO ACCURATELY DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF THE VARIOUS ACTIVITIES BEING TESTED TO THEN INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE- DECISION SO FOR EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER A HIGHER AUTOMATIC REDUCTION FOR LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS OR REDUCTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T CURRENTLY% QUALIFY UNDER THE DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME- BUT OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD AND EXPANDS THE AVAILABILITY OF THE OF THE ABILITY TO QUE PIECE OF THE TALK WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ONLY APPROVED THE TWELVE POINT THREE MILLION REQUESTED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THIS WOULD PROVIDE LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS WITH THE RELIEF- BUT IT WOULD PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM AUTOMATICALLY ROLLING OUT BEYOND THE TEN PORTS THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED USING THESE DOLLARS- AFTER THE BUDGET YEAR BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CHANCE TO SORT OF EVALUATE TAKE THE INFORMATION FROM THE EVALUATION THAT STILL AND USE THAT AS PART OF ITS DELIBERATIONS- THE FINAL PIECES THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES INCLUDE- LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ALL INFRACTION PROCEEDINGS TO OCCUR REMOTELY- AND SO ON THAT ONE IF THE LEGISLATURE IS INTERESTED IN IMPROVING ITBECAUSE IT DOES HAVE BENEFITS OF PROMOTING EQUITY AND INCREASING ACCESS. WE O RECOMMENDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO SUBMIT AN EVALUATION OR REPORT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS IN THIS AREA SUCH AS WHETHER TO EXPAND REMOTE PROCEEDINGS TO OTHER CASE TYPES FOR EXAMPLE IS. REALLY RIGHT NOW THE IMPACT ON COURT WORKLOAD AND HOSTAGE ANOTHER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM. I JUST ZERO NINE DEPARTMENT FINANCE GO AHEAD. BASED ON PRELIMINARY DATA WE KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDING SUBSTANTIAL AND CRITICAL RELIEF TO LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO CURRENTLY FACE UNDUE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FROM FINES AND FEES UNFORTUNATELY THIS RELIEF IS CURRENTLY LIMITED TO INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN ONE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THE PILOT PROGRAM GIVEN THE BURDEN FINES AND FEES IMPOSED ON WELCOME CALIFORNIANS WHICH HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE RECENT IMPACTS FROM THE ECONOMIC RECESSION. WE STILL THERE'S AN OUTAGE WE FEEL THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO EXTEND TARGET REALLY WALLOWING COMMITTEE BIGGLES REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE FURTHERMORE THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS FOR THE TRAVELERS TO MODERNIZE THEIR OPERATIONS WITH ADDITIONAL FEATURES SUCH AS ONLINE EDUCATION INFRACTIONS WHICH FURTHER PROMOTES ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR COURT USERS ONLINE EDUCATION OF INFRACTIONS IS ALSO CRITICAL TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL DISTANCING WHICH MEDICAID PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS FACED BY CALIFORNIANS. OTHERWISE AFTERSHOW TO REPORT DURING THE ACADEMIC INFRACTION GENERALLY ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN MEANS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF IN THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHAT COULD ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM BEING ABLE TO EDUCATE THEIR INFRACTIONS REMOTELY RATHER THAN GOING INTO THE PORT. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING RESULTS ON THE HIGHWAY AS MENTIONED ABOVE THE RETENTION BEFORE HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO HELP COMES FROM THE PARTY'S BEEN COUNTIES THAT IMPLEMENTED ONLINE UNITED NATIONS IS PROMISING INTRODUCED BINDING FEES FOR LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS BY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS OF JANUARY THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR INTERMINGLING. WE'RE PROPOSING A PHASED ROLLOUT OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS ADDITIONAL IT DOES NOT MAKE IT BECOMES AVAILABLE BASED ON THE REPORT JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO WILL BE ABLE TO COURSE CORRECT AND MAKE ANY NECESSARY CHANGES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WITH THIS PROCESS THANK YOU. AT THANK YOU A APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S- I A QUESTION- BEFORE OPEN UP THE COMMITTEE. SO WE KNOW THAT THE PILOTS ARE SHOWING THAT. YOU SET THE COURTS ARE FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IF I CONSISTENT ACROSS ACROSS THE COUNTIES THAT WE SEE DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS- AND DIFFERENT COURT ROOMS OUT THERE AND SO HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT WE HAVE MORE CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE COUNTIES. IF I MAY MADAM CHAIR THIS IS SHELLY BERMAN WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS ORIGINALLY ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE LEGISLATURE REQUESTED THAT- LANGUAGE BE INCLUDED WHERE PEOPLE RECEIVE AT LEAST A 50% AFFECT WHICH WOULD RECOMMEND A 50% BENEFIT. SOME COURTS CHOSE TO PROVIDE- GREATER RELIEF- BECAUSE THAT WORKS FOR THEM VOCALLY AND SO MOST COURTS HAVE FOLLOWED WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS SUGGESTED OTHER COURTS HAVE GONE A LITTLE BIT FURTHER- BUT WHAT WE REALLY HOPE FOR IS. A DISCRETION BECAUSE WITH JUDICIAL OFFICERS DO IS THEY LOOK AT THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION. I WILL NOTE THAT- CONSUMERS ARE RECEIVING ABOUT A 54% THAT'S THE AVERAGE REDUCTION. AND AROUND 70% OF THE TIME- THE JUDICIAL OFFICERS ARE WITHIN TEN DOLLARS OF. THE AMOUNT THAT'S RECOMMENDED FROM THE FULL. MEMBERS. I DON'T HAVE A CONSISTENT WITH WITH WHAT WE SAID BEFORE I WONDER FOR GOING ABOUT THIS THE RIGHT WAY BECAUSE THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE RISEN FROM THE FEE STRUCTURE IN THE IN THE COURTS AND FIND THAT WE'RE DOING THIS AND PROVIDING SOME RELIEF BUT THAT'S DETRIMENTAL TO HOW WE FINANCE THE COURT SYSTEMS AND BECAUSE WE'VE JUST PUT OFF THAT DISCUSSION AND BUILT A SYSTEM WHERE. THESE FEES AND FINES ARE ARE SO IMPORTANT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO COME AROUND AND IN PROVIDE A PILOT TO LOOK AT THE BILLION TO PAY WHEN WE REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE AT. THE UNDERLYING. WAY THAT WE HAVE BUILT THE SYSTEM SO I HOPE THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL REMAIN ON THE TABLE AND WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BE. LOOKING AT AT A RELIEF TO. A FINANCING MECHANISM- THIS ABILITY TO PAY PILOT PROGRAM WITHOUT REALLY LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF WHY WE GOT TO THE SITUATION WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT. IN THE FUTURE SO. I THINK THIS IS GOOD AS FAR AS IT IS BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE HARD LOOK AT THE WHAT WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON TO FUND. COURTS. NORTHERN OR FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE SANDEMAN GONNA MOVE ON TO THE NEXT A PANEL ON REMOTE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS. BEGAN YES THANK YOU AGAIN THIS IS LUCK WITH YOUR SEARCH FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. THAT'S PROPOSAL IS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO LAUGH REMOTE PROCEEDINGS AND ALL CIVIL ACTIONS THIS LANGUAGE IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BRAND'S POST CONDIMENT BUDGET TIME TO PROVIDE FOR GREATER EQUITY IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE. FOR THE PUBLIC IN CIVIL MATTERS THIS BUDGET PLAN INCLUDES TWO OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE PEOPLE'S TO DISCUSS. AND WE WILL DISCUSS ADDITIONAL- PROPOSALS LATER FIRST WE HAVE PRESIDING JUDGE OF ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT- SINCE JUDGE TESTED TELL US TO PROVIDE. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HOW REMOTE PROCEEDINGS HAVE IT WILL MATERIALLY BENEFIT COURT USERS AND COURT OPERATIONS YOU WILL BE FOLLOWED BY THE ARRIVAL YOUNG ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. ON THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU. THIRTY EVERYONE AND THANK U. S. SOCCER SAID MY NAME IS HARD AS A CHILD I AM THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. I'M ALSO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE TRIAL COURT PRESIDING JUDGES ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE TRAILER LEGISLATION THE TRAILER BILL PROMOTING THE CONTINUANCE OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS EVEN AFTER THIS PANDEMIC. NOW WHEN THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC FORCED THE UNFORTUNATE CLOSURE OF OUR COURT AND DRASTIC MODIFICATION OF COURT OPERATIONS ONE YEAR AGO WE STRUGGLED TO FIGURE OUT. HOW OMITS THE PANDEMIC WHITE MEAT MIGHT WE BE ABLE TO RE OPEN AND CONTINUE COURT OPERATIONS IN A WAY. THAT WOULD MAINTAIN AND PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL OF OUR CORE USERS. AND OUR COURT PERSONNEL. THE ANSWER WAS THROUGH REMOTE OPERATIONS. AND THE WAY WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS WAS WITH THE HELP AND ASSISTANCE OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. IT WAS AN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WHERE THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ENACTED EMERGENCY RULE THREE WHICH AUTHORIZED EACH OF OUR COURTS TO ENACT EMERGENCY LOCAL RULES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE. REMOTE APPEARANCES IN COURT PROCEEDINGS. ALAMEDA COUNTY WAS ONE OF A NUMBER OF COURTS THAT CONSISTENT WITH THIS AUTHORITY ENACTED LOCAL RULES. OUR EMERGENCY LOCAL RULES MANDATED REMOTE APPEARANCES ACROSS ALL NON CRIMINAL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS. AND THIS IS HOW WE WERE ABLE TO RE OPEN. AND RESUME COURT OPERATIONS ACROSS ALL CASE TYPES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC DESPITE THE SPIKES DESPITE THE SEARCHES AND INCLUDING JURY TRIALS. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM THIS WAS THE REMOTE PROCEEDINGS GAVE US TREMENDOUS BENEFITS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT UNQUESTIONABLY EXPANDED ACCESS TO OUR COURTS. THAT OPPORTUNITY WAS FELT BY LITIGANTS WHO PREVIOUSLY PRE PANDEMIC HAD TO TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTY TAKE TIME OFF WORK MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR CHILD CARE DEPENDENT CARE AND SO ON TO SIT IN THE COURTHOUSE PERHAPS ALL DAY FOR A COURT HEARING THAT MIGHT TAKE AS LITTLE AS THIRTY MINUTES. THESE LITIGANTS NOW CAN ACCESS THEIR COURT APPEARANCE CAN PARTICIPATE FULLY REMOTELY WITHOUT THAT SUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION TO THEIR SCHEDULE. SIGNALLY ATTORNEYS WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD TO CLEAR CALENDARS NOW ARE ABLE TO REPRESENT MULTIPLE CLIENTS IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. THIS BENEFIT BENEFITS THE LITIGANTS WHO ARE HIRING THE ATTORNEYS BECAUSE THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY THOSE TRAVEL COSTS THEY NO LONGER HAVE TO PAY FOR THE TIME THAT THE ATTORNEYS ARE WAITING IN COURT. NOW THESE ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES ARE WHAT WE HOPED AND EXPECTED WOULD HAPPEN WHEN WE ENACTED OUR OWN EMERGENCY REMOTE ROLES BUT WE'VE IN FACT FOUND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT WERE NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED. FOR EXAMPLE IN HIGH CONFLICT CALENDAR COURT SUCH AS FAMILY LAW PROBATE RESTRAINING ORDER CALENDARS WE FOUND THAT REMOTE APPEARANCES ACTUALLY DECREASE THE TENSION LEVELS IN THOSE COURTS. BY NOT HAVING TO SIT ACROSS THE TABLE FROM SOMEBODY WHO YEAR IN IT D. BATTLE WITH. THAT TENSION IS REDUCED SUCH THAT REMOTE APPEARANCES HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO FACILITATE SETTLEMENT AND DIFFERENT CASE AND ISSUE RESOLUTION OPPORTUNITY. IN OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS WE'VE ALSO SEEN THE BENEFITS OF REMOTE APPEARANCES FOR EXAMPLE IN CERTAIN JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS OR COLLABORATIVE COURTS REMOTE APPEARANCES ENABLED LITIGANTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONTINUUM OF CARE. THEY CAN BE EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTED AND CAN PARTICIPATE IN COURT REMOTELY AND STILL MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING THEIR TREATMENT AND THEY'RE ADDITIONAL CARE OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION. JURORS LIKE OUR REMOTE APPEARANCES REMOTE APPEARANCES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE POOL OF POTENTIAL JURORS WHO WORK WITH OUR COURTS IT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THOSE THAT MIGHT HAVE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES OR CERTAIN HEALTH OR HOME CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NEED TO BE DEALT WITH POTENTIALLY BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THOSE THAT CAN ALSO SERVE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AS JURORS. IN ADDITION THOSE JURORS THROUGH ROAD APPEARANCES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE AND HEAR THE EVIDENCE THE SAME WAY SOMETHING THAT OUR OLD COURTHOUSES DO NOT NECESSARILY AFFORD. THE REMOTE APPEARANCES HAVE BEEN SUCH A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THAT HAS RECENTLY AS JUST LAST MONTH ON FEBRUARY EIGHT WE ENACTED A NON EMERGENCY LOCAL RULES TO PROMOTE THE CONTINUANCE OF REMOTE APPEARANCES EVEN POST PANDEMIC AS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. AND THAT'S JUST ONE REASON WHY WE SUPPORT THIS TRAILER LANGUAGE. AS WE KNOW AND AS HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AT THIS YEAR AND SO FAR THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS OFTEN SLOW IN PARTICULAR THE COURTS AND NOT QUICK TO ADJUST. THE PANDEMIC HAS FORCED OUR RAPID MOVEMENT IN ALL DIRECTIONS THAT WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE. BUT SOME OF THIS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN FOR THE CUT. AND THAT IS WITH REMOTE APPEARANCE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS CARRY THIS POSITIVE MOMENTUM FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SERVE ALL OF THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. AS EFFICIENTLY. AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE THE TRAILER LEGISLATION WOULD ENABLE THAT TO HAPPEN WITH OUT CREATING A GAP. WITHOUT CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A PAUSE FOR A STOP BACK THAT WOULD SERIOUSLY UNDERMINE THE GREAT PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE SO FAR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'M NOT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR SPEAKERS. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I JUST DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE GOAL OF THE LANGUAGE IS TO PROMOTE MODERNIZATION AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE. ALLOW COURTS THE REMOTE TECHNOLOGY BUILD UP DURING THE PANDEMIC I'M JUST LIKE YOU KNOW THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE AND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE POTENTIALLY REFINE THE LANGUAGE IN REGARDS TO THE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION. FOR A PILOT TO POTENTIALLY BE COMPLETED I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE TRUMP WORDS HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERING HERBAL PROCEEDINGS FOR CIVIL CASES OVER FOR JUST ABOUT A YEAR AND THAT CAN YOU COME FROM A BILL TO PROVIDE DIGESTIBLE DATA CONCERNING THESE PROCEEDINGS WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY REMOVE THE NECESSITY FOR A PILOT PROGRAM TO BE COMPLETED. AGAIN THIS WILL NEED TO TAKE PLACE IN. FUTURE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE DONE AROUND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S THE LET'S ANALYST. I NEED ONLY WITH THE L. A. L. ARE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE A COPY OF OUR HAND OUT BUT IT WAS POSTED ONLINE ALONG WITH THE AGENDA AND IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE ON THIS ISSUE- IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE'RE JUST GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY THINGS THAT WILL- HELP UNDERSTAND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THIS ISSUE. IN THE FIRST THING THAT WE JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS WE VIEW THIS LANDS AT THROUGH THE LENS OF PROVIDING THIS AUTHORITY ON AN ONGOING BASIS WHICH MEANS AFTER THE PANDEMIC ENDS AND WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS A SITUATION AND USE APPROPRIATE USE OF REMOTE PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC BUT THEN ALSO AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE WANT WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. ON BECAUSE OF THE BENEFITS WE DO THINK THAT THE EXPANSION OF REMOTE PROCEEDING IS WARRANTED BUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE AND SO THE FIRST THING THAT WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER WHETHER REMOTE PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR USE IN ALL CASE TYPES ARE PROCEEDINGS. OR WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE STATE LAW THAT INCLUDES A CERTAIN MINIMUM STANDARDS TO ENSURE THAT COURT USERS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE SIMILAR EXPERIENCES AND SO CURRENTLY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE ACCESS SPECIFIC AT LEAST SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IF YOU LOOK AT OUR HAND OUT ON PAGEFIVE- IT LAYS OUT THE KEY QUESTIONS BUT INCLUDES HOW WOULD COURTS USE THE FORTY IS IT GONNA BE REQUIRED OR OPTIONAL HOW WOULD THE COURT PROCESSES CHANGE. WOOD FAIRNESS EQUITY PRIVACY IN PUBLIC ACCESS ISSUES BE ADDRESSED AND IF SO IN WHAT MANNER AS A BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DETAILS ON THESE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION IT'S REALLY HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE IMPACTS ON TRIAL COURT OPERATIONS PROCESSES AND COSTS WOULD BE AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT PAGES SIX AND SEVEN OF THE ONLY A HAND OUT IT LAYS OUT SOME OF THOSE. KEY IMPACTS SUCH AS YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE THE NET IMPACT ON COURT WORKLOAD AND COST BUT GOING BACK TO SOMETHING THAT IS SIMPLY MEMBER STONE ACTUALLY BROUGHT UP WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT ON ONGOING FACILITY- AND SO IN LIGHT OF THESE CONCERNS WE DO HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS ON PAGE. EIGHT OF THE HANDOUT AND SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ONE. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LET. TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO SUBMIT A DETAILED PLAN. FOR HOW REMOTE. WOULD BE AND- BY CASE TYPE AND WE'RE PROCEEDING TYPE. SO THIS PLAN WHICH ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE WHETHER. AND HOW TO MODIFY THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS IS USED IN A WAY THAT IS ON THE IN LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SUCH AS YOU KNOW SETTING MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EXCLUDING CERTAIN TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS. FROM WROTE FROM REMOTE- OPERATING REMOTELY. AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT INFORMATION CAN BE PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE LEGISLATURE MY SPINAL CORD. BUT IF THEY CAN'T THEN IT COULD BE A DISCUSSION FOR THE NEXT BUDGET HERE. OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD BEFORE A PLAN IS RECEIVED AND THIS IS GONNA BE ON PAGE NINE OF YOUR HAND OUT. AND UNDER THIS ONE WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PILOT REMOTE PROCEEDINGS FOR TWO YEARS AND LESS COMPLEX CASE TYPES OR PROCEEDINGS. SUCH AS INFRACTIONS ARE SMALL CLAIMS PLACES AND REQUIRING EVALUATION BY NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS APPROACH WOULD INFORM LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO EXTEND EXPAND OR MODIFY THE AUTHORIZATION ONCE THE PILOT ENDS. AND THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES TO BE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED IN AREAS THAT HAVE LESS IMPACT ON COURT USERS LIVES. BEFORE BEING EXPANDED TO MORE COMPLEX CASE TYPES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH WOULD HAVE THE BENEFIT OF MINIMIZING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND COSTS- IN RELATION TO MR ROMIJN COMMENTS ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND USING THAT AS A PILOT. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LESSONS LEARNT THROUGH THE PANDEMIC- BUT THE KEY THING THAT WE WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THAT INDIVIDUAL COURTS HAVE HAD DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES. BASED ON THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEIR LOCAL PRIORITIES AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE SAYING THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GO WITH OUR FIRST APPROACH OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF THE PLAN. YOU THINK ABOUT PILOTING ACROSS THE STATE SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW. TRIAL COURTS GENERALLY ACROSS THE STATE. WOULD BE IMPACTED. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE THAT TO SPEAK ON THE SIDE OF. MADAM SHERRY AND ROB- YEAH AGAIN THAT FOR THE R. J. COUNCIL PROVIDE A BIT MORE FIRST ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU ROBERT- YEAH FROM G. CAL- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE ROLE PROCEEDINGS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT LIKE WE'RE DOING TODAY AT THIS HEARING A PARTICIPATING REMOTELY BY VIDEO NOT ONLY OFFERS SAY IT'S SAFE AND CONVENIENT WAY FOR THE PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE IN IMPORTANT PROCEEDINGS DURING THE PANDEMIC. ABOUT WILL PROVIDE CONTINUED EXPANDED ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE FUTURE I REMOTE APPEARANCES AS WELL AS MANY OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH INCLUDE MODERNIZATION FUNDING. ENDEMIC EARLY DISPOSITION CALENDAR PROGRAM SUPPORT FOR SELF HELP AN ONLINE TRAFFIC EDUCATION ARE ALL PIECES OF A MUCH BIGGER PLAN DESIGNED TO INCREASE EQUITY AND ACCESS ROUTE THE STATE. THE PANDEMIC WHILE THE NUMBER OF CASE FILINGS DROPPED BY ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT. THE NUMBER OF CASES POSITIONS HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY ABOUT. 50% IN TWENTY TWENTY COMPARED TO TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S ONLY BECAUSE OF REMOTE HEARINGS THAT THIS NUMBER IS NOT WORSE. FUNDING FOR REMOTE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN PART OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH'S STRATEGIC PLAN FOR TECHNOLOGY FOR ABOUT SEVEN YEARS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED THE CHALLENGES OF REMOTE PROCEEDING SUCH AS FORGETTING TO GO OFF MUTE BUT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC THAT REMOTE HEARINGS PROVIDE EQUITY. IN THE COURTROOM. M. FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING JUVENILES AN EQUAL SPACE ON THE VIDEO SCREEN RATHER THAN BEING OVERSHADOWED BY ADULTS IN A LARGE COURTHOUSE. REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD AND PROGRESS IS UNDENIABLE. WE'VE HAD SUCCESS. IN TELEPHONIC HEARING FOR MANY YEARS AND NOW WHERE TELEPHONIC HEARINGS HAVE GIVEN PEOPLE A VOICE IN COURT. PROCEEDINGS HAVE NOW GIVEN THEM AN EQUAL PRESENCE WITHOUT THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WILL BE LIMITING ACCESS AND BE TAKING AWAY VALUABLE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE LINE WHICH IS VERY BROAD AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME ARE WE ALLOWING EACH. COUNTY TO EMPLOYMENT- THE ONLY PROCEEDINGS. HOWEVER THEY WANT. CAN SOMEONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME. GO AHEAD- THE HEAD. IT IN TERMS OF THE- PROMOTE PROCEEDINGS WELL WHAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND- AS MR ROMANIAN HAS MENTIONED WE HAVE TREATED THIS PANDEMIC PERIOD AS THE PILOT PERIOD AND SO DURING THIS TIME WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE HAVE COLLECTED FEEDBACK BOTH FROM THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS FROM THE COURTS IN TERMS OF BEST PRACTICES- CONSISTENCY USE AND SO WE'VE ACTUALLY PUBLISH SOME GUIDELINES IN A PANDEMIC. CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS RESOURCE GUIDE- WHICH TALKS ABOUT- GENERAL CONFIGURATION BEST PRACTICES THAT COURTS CAN USE AND SO WE ANTICIPATE HI N. AS WE SEE NOW- THAT COURTS WILL HAVE A FEW DIFFERENCES BASED ON THEIR LOCAL DEPENDENCIES OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND SO FORTH- HOWEVER WE DO. ANTICIPATE THAT PEOPLE WILL BEGIN FOLLOWING THOSE GUIDELINES FOR CONSISTENCY AND LEVERAGING BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE DIFFERENT COURT. WITH SOMEONE ELSE CAN I SAY SOMETHING ON THAT. AVERAGE THIS IS A NEARLY WITH THE L. A. L. WE WERE JUST GONNA WE WERE GOING TO BRING UP THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN OUR READING OF THE LANGUAGE WE DO THINK IT'S QUITE BROAD AND THE DISCRETION IS PROVIDED TO BOTH JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AS WELL AS THE COURTS IN TERMS OF HOW TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU I DO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WILL HAVE SOME COUNTIES WHO WILL. PROCEED WITH THE MAILLET PROCEEDING SOME MIGHT NOT DO ANY. SO MICHAEL ALL THE WAY AND SO. IT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOMETHING CONSISTENT ACROSS. THE STATE. AS WELL AS WE DO BEST PRACTICES ENSURE% THAT IMPLEMENTATION IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE. ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY. OUT THERE AND SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANYTHING TRIED. OKAY HI IN THAT CASE I WILL MOVE ON TO- THE NEXT ISSUE ISSUE NUMBER THREE DOJ OVERVIEW- WE WILL HAVE A SUB COMMITTEE FOR THE DNA LAB CONSOLIDATION. THE PANEL MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS CHRIS RYAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE WILL- ABBREVIATE OUR COMENTS BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY OPEN TO QUESTIONS. THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSED BUDGET IS ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THOSE- FUNDS ARE SPECIAL FUNDS AND FROM APPROXIMATE THIRTY SEPARATE SPECIAL FUNDS AN APPROXIMATE 30% OF THE BUDGET I REQUEST GENERAL FUND THREE AN APARTMENT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN OFFICE BUILDINGS LABS FIELD OFFICES AND TASK FORCES ACROSS THE STATE FROM A BUDGET PERSPECTIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS COMPRISED OF THE DIVISION OF LEGAL SERVICES CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION. AND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF TODAY IS THAT- THERE ARE FOUR BCPS THAT WILL COVER AT A AT A HIGH LEVEL- TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE QUESTIONS ON THOSE BCPS WE HAVE FOLKS AVAILABLE. SO THE FIRST PCP THAT WILL COVER THE HEALTHCARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS DIVISION WORKLOAD THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST TEN POSITIONS AND TWO POINT ONE MILLION. FROM THE PUBLIC RIGHTS AW ENFORCEMENT SPECIAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND I'M GOING TO THE DOJ TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD RELATED TO HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS- THIS IS A PROPOSAL ON THIS PORTION OF THE PROPOSAL- WAS PRESENTED LAST YEAR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT DURING THE MAY REVISED- THIS PART OF THE PROPOSAL WAS THE GENERAL FUND REQUEST AND SO DURING THE MAY REVISE IT WAS PULLED OUT- WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK- WITH THE NEW FUNDING SOURCES SPECIAL FUND- THAT CAN FUND THESE OPERATIONS THROUGH SETTLEMENT. FUNDS AND THE WORKLOAD RELATED TO THESE POSITIONS RELATES PRIMARILY TO OUR ABILITY OR CAPACITY TO CONDUCT COMPETITIVE IMPACT ANALYSIS RELATED TO HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION TRANSACTIONS. AND OVERSEEING THE ACTIVITY IN THE WORK- SO STAYED WITH THE SUTTER CASE- AND TO INVESTIGATE AND BRING SUIT AGAINST OTHER LARGE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO MIMIC- SUTTER'S ANTI COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. WITHOUT THESE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. THE HEALTH CARE RIGHTS AND ACCESS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENGAGE. IN ALL THE ACT PLANNED FOR AND BRINGING. AGAINST OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE ENGAGED IN SIMILAR ANTI COMPETITIVE ACTIVITIES. THE NEXT REQUEST- THAT'LL COVER RELATED TO THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW AND EVALUATION SYSTEM THIS IS THE CARE SYSTEM. IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION SERVICES SYSTEM- AND THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE- THESE ARE HELP DESK POSITIONS- THE FUNDING FLOWS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THROUGH A REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT- COVERS- IT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND- AND COVERS POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING HELP DESK SERVICES- TO FOLKS THAT ACCESS THE INFORMATION OR ART. ARE INPUTTING INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM- IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE CURES PROGRAM RECEIVED AN AVERAGE OF. ALMOST FIVE THOUSAND CALLS RELATED TO- EMAILS AND- AND CALLS PER MONTH AND SO WE'RE E'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE SPLIT CONTINUE THESE POSITIONS THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR US FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS THE NORTHERN REGION CONSOLIDATED FORENSIC SCIENCE LABORATORY CAMPUS- AGAIN THIS IS A PROPOSAL THAT WE HAD STARTED LAST YEAR- LAST YEAR YOU SAW SOME. PROPOSAL RELATED TO LAND ACQUISITION THIS PROPOSAL IS SIX POINT FIVE MILLION RELATED. TO GLAVIN OFFICE SPACE IN SACRAMENTO. AND SO IT WOULD CONSOLIDATE BRENT BUREAU FORENSIC SERVICES- RICHMOND IN A LAB THE SACRAMENTO REGION CRIME LAB. CALIFORNIA CRIMINALISTICS INSTITUTE AND THE HEADQUARTERS STAFF ALL INTO. ONE FACILITY- THE FINAL PCP PROPOSAL THAT WILL COVER AND THEN I UNDERSTAND LA YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS- RELATES TO THE DNA IDENTIFICATION FUND BACKFILL- THIS IS A FUND THAT HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT REVENUE DROPS- THE LAST EW YEARS- AS WAS DISCUSSED DURING THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S BUDGET- RELATED TO FINES AND FEE REVENUE. ANSWER THIS BACK PHIL- BACK FEELS THOSE THOSE REVENUES IT DIMINISHED AND INSURES THAT THE FORENSIC LAB. HAS THE REVENUE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT OPERATIONS- SO WITH THAT WE WILL- TURN IT BACK OUT TO YOU OR TURNED OVER TO ALEJO. L. A. OVERHEAD. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE HAVE FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES OF THESE ARE ITEMS THREE AND FOUR ON YOUR AGENDA WILL START WITH- ITEM FOR WHICH IS THE BACK FELT- WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE BACKFILL BUT ONLY FOR TWO YEARS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT REVENUES AND THE FINGERPRINT FEES ACCOUNT WHICH IS USED WHICH IS BEING USED TO BACKFILL- A PORTION OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE BUREAU- AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE REVENUES HAVE BEEN LOWER. THAN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THE FUNDS COULD BECOME INSOLVENT IN A COUPLE YEARS OF THE REVENUES DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY INCREASE ON THIS TWO YEARS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE. THE BUREAU WITH FUNDING WALL OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. SO MY LOOK AT OUR SECOND RECOMMENDATION FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS TO IMPLEMENT A NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK- TO REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PARTIALLY SUPPORT THE BUREAU OF FORENSIC SERVICES BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT THAT CERTAIN LOCAL AGENCIES AND FORTY SIX COUNTIES ARE RECEIVING FROM THE BUREAU- WHICH IS PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE LOCAL AGENCIES AT NO CHARGE. AND SO REQUIRING THAT LOCAL AGENCIES CONTRIBUTE TO PAY A PORTION. OF THE COST TO SUPPORT THE BUREAU COULD PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO PRIORITIZE THE WORK THAT IS BEING SUBMITTED TO DOJ AND REDUCE THE AN ONGOING NEED FOR GENERAL FUND SUPPORT- SO CURRENTLY THE SUBMISSIONS ARE REALLY ONLY LIMITED BY DOJ'S OVERALL CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT THE STATE PROVIDES TO THE SUPPORT THE BUREAU. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THOSE TWELVE COUNTIES IN EIGHT CITIES THAT ARE OPERATING THEIR OWN LABS ARE CURRENTLY SERVE PRIORITIZING. THEIR WORKLOAD. OUR THIRD RECOMMENDATION- YOU KNOW TO HELP WITH THIS FUNDING FOR MARK IS THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE DOJ DEVELOP AND REPORT ON A PLAN NO LATER THAN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. FOR CALCULATING EACH LOCAL AGENCIES AND SERVICE PROVIDES DOJ WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SPECIFICS OF THAT FUNDING FROM WORK WOULD LOOK LIKE SO SHOULD THERE BE A DIFFERENCE IN SHARE BASED ON THE TYPE OF FORENSIC SERVICE. BEING USED THE SPEED OF THE SERVICE OR THE TECH- OR SIZE OF THE AGENCY. I IN LINE IS THAT IT REALLY ITEMS OF YOURS ON THE CONSOLE. FACILITY WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS PROPOSAL UNTIL THE NEW FUNDING FRAMEWORK IS IMPLEMENTED. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE NEW FUNDING FROM WORK WOULD PROVIDE GREATER INCENTIVE FOR- ENTITIES TO FIND THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF OBTAINING LABORATORY SERVICES AND THAT COULD CHANGE THE NEED. FOR THE FACILITY AND IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. COMMENTS BY MAY. TEN WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YES QUITE SOME PICTURES SO SPECIFICALLY ON THE DNA IDENTIFICATION AND FIND THE BACK FELL OBVIOUSLY WE PUT THAT COVERS BUDGET INCLUDES ON GOING FUNDING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WE PUT IN ONE TIME FUNDING THE LAST FEW YEARS AND ALSO ALTHOUGH THAT FUNDING IS ON GOING IT WILL IT'LL BE ADJUSTED EACH YEAR THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BASED ON ACTUAL REVENUES EXPENDITURES. AND THEN JUST ONE COMMENT ON HOW ITS RECOMMENDATION TO POTENTIALLY HAVE COUNTIES PAY SOME PORTION OF YOUR FORENSIC SERVICES COSTS I THINK WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT- BECAUSE THE WORD ABOUT SMALLER COUNTY THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY FOR SOME SERVICES THEY MAY HAVE TO- UNFORTUNATE PRIORITIZED BY GIVING CERTAIN DNA INFORMATION AND- YOU MAY BE AT THAT PROCESS THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN ISSUE NUMBER THREE. I'M SURE WE HAVE A VERY MILLER AVAILABLE- THERE'S- INTEREST IN HEARING HOW THE NEW MODEL COULD IMPACT LOCALS. I'M GONNA I'M GONNA HOLD OFF ON THAT TO FOR THE SAKE OF TIME. I REMEMBER SEVENTY QUESTIONS. ON THIS ISSUE LOW- WE HAVE HEARD A LITTLE BIT IN MY OFFICE ABOUT THE DNA LAB CONSOLIDATION- AND THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT TO IS CONSOLIDATING THE SACRAMENTO AREA LABS AND IF WE WERE TO DO THAT SMALLER SCALE DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH THAT WOULD COST- AND IS THE DOJ OPEN TO CONSIDERING ONLY CONSOLIDATING THE SACRAMENTO AREA LABS. YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT. YES THANK YOU- MANAGER THIS IS VERY MILLER WITH THE GIRLFRIEND SIX SERVICES IN THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. B. THAT PROPOSAL HAS BEEN LOOKED AT OR WHETHER OR NOT WE WOULD JUST NEED TO CONSOLIDATE JUST SACRAMENTO IN RICHMOND BUT IT'S CONTRARY TO THE GOAL OF. ACTUALLY SAVING MONEY IN BEING IN THE BAY AREA WITH THE RICHMOND LABORATORY THAT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE LEAST FOR THE BUREAU AND WE DON'T HAVE THE MOST COMPETITIVE SALARY IN THE STATE FOR THE CRIMINALIST FORENSIC SCIENTISTS THAT WE EMPLOY THEIR- WE HAVE FOUND THAT. THINGS ARE MOVING TOWARDS A LOT OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA. CANDIDATES IN THE SCHOOLS APPLYING FOR THAT AREA BUT NOT NECESSARILY TAKING JOBS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A COMPETITIVE SALARY IN WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT SO. THANK YOU THERE ARE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE SO I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE THANK YOU ALL AND THEN WE WANT TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR I THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL PRESENT ON VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS TO IMPLEMENT LET'S LOOK. LEGISLATION THE PANEL MAY BE GETTING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHRIS RYAN- CHIEF OF THE DIVISION OF OPERATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I THANK YOU- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES EIGHT LEGISLATIVE BCPS TO BEGIN THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW STATUTORY MANDATES REQUIREMENTS ACROSS MANY DIVISIONS AT DOJ- THE EIGHT PROPOSALS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SEVENTY POSITIONS OF THE EIGHTEEN MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH LEGISLATIVE BCPS APPROXIMATE THIRTEEN MILLION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AB FIFTEEN OH SIX THE POLICE USE OF FORCE BILL AND WE'LL SPEND SOMETIME TALKING ABOUT THAT TODAY ON THE OTHER BILLS GENERALLY SPEAKING- OUR WORK ASSESS STATED THAT WITH THEM SUPPORT SPECIFIED FOR DOJ TO SUPPORT SPECIFIED WORKING GROUP'S- ALSO TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS OR MAKE CERTAIN. CHANGES TO OUR IT SYSTEMS- TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THE NEW- STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS. WITH TO AB FIFTY NO SIX- THIS WORKLOAD- IT'S A NEW WORKLOAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS THAT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD AND AS WE- INDICATED- IN THE EIGHTIES LETTER TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY ON JANUARY TWENTY SIX. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT FOLKS WORKING WITH DOJ IN THE MINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION- WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS TO SECURE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND TIME CRITICAL NEED TO ESTABLISH A THOROUGH. AND INDEPENDENT PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING INCIDENTS ARE SPECIFIED IN AB FIFTEEN A SIX. ARE THE CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE WHAT DOJ HAS ESTIMATED IS NEEDED TO FULLY IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB FIFTY A SIX. FOR EXAMPLE IT DOES NOT INCLUDE RESOURCES FOR POLICE PRACTICES DIVISION- WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE UP AND RUNNING BY JULY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. IN ADDITION- THE CURRENT PROPOSAL ONLY PROVIDES THREE TEAMS- ACROSS THE STATE WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT FOUR TEAMS- ARE WHAT'S NEEDED GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC. SIZE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE THESE INCIDENTS- TYPICALLY HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL TEAM. THESE INVESTIGATIONS OF OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS CONTAIN MANY ACTIVITIES AND EACH ARE INCREDIBLY COMPLEX THE DIVISION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN INVESTIGATING OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS OUR EXPERIENCE IS LIMITED TO ONE REVIEW OF AN INVESTIGATION. CONDUCTED BY A LOCAL AGENCY AFTER THE CASE WAS COMPLETED IN ADDITION DALY INDEPENDENTLY CONDUCTED ONE OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING INVESTIGATION IN A SMALL COUNTY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN- I WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR MODEL OR ESTIMATE. WAS BASED ON APPROXIMATELY FORTY INCIDENTS- THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WILL REQUIRE THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND THAT ARE ESTIMATED NEED FOR THIS PROGRAM ON THE WHOLE IS ABOUT TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS- RAMPING UP TO THIRTY MILLION WHEN THE POLICE PRACTICES DIVISION IS UP AND RUNNING AS WELL- WE'RE OPEN TO- I CAN GIVE YOU SOME INFORMATION ON. HOW WE GOT THERE. WE FEEL LIKE A- WE HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC NEED- WE HAVE 20% OF USE OF FORCE- CURRENT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PROFIT LEVIN PERCENT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND 61% IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA- SO OUR MODEL THAT WE HAD. PRESENTED DURING THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS I WAS A MODEL TO ADDRESS THE STATEWIDE- INCIDENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS- ALL- WE HAVE EXPERTS- IF THERE'S QUESTIONS- SO AT THIS POINT ALL- I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE. YES TIM WEBER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WOULD BE THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALLOWS DOJ TO ESTABLISH INVESTIGATIVE PROGRAM COLLECT DATA AND ACTUAL WORKLOAD IT'S MIDDLE CLASS THE FUTURE- IF NECESSARY. I DON'T BUDGET INCLUDES. FUNDING FOR THREE TEAMS ONE EACH AT CENTRAL SOUTHERN. AND NORTHERN REGION. I WOULD HAVE TO I HAVE TO PROTECT ENTIRE STATES. AND WE'RE GOING TO WORK IN THE PART OF JUSTICE AS HE CAN- MEDICAL WITH MINOR AND IF THESE RESOURCES ARE NECESSARY AS MR REID MENTIONED THE POLICE BACK TO DIVISION FUNDING WAS INCLUDED THIS POINT SO THE PARK THAT'S WHAT TO COME BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS SURPLUS FUNDING AND AT THAT POINT TO GET UP TO ME TO RE EVALUATE. THE PROGRESS THAT THE BASKET TEAMS. THANK YOU ALEJO. I NEED A WITH THE L. A. O. WE HAVE NO CAN ON THESE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER PRESENTERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THE FEDERAL. NUMBER THE LAST ITEM MADAM CHAIR THE LAST ITEM I THINK WE WERE PLANNING TO COVER WAS THE BILL RELATED TO SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST ONE POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ONE MILLION IN TWENTY TWO THIS IS A SYSTEM- IT'S PART OF OUR- CHARGE TO CONVENE A WORKING GROUP NECESSARY TO SUBMIT A PLAN. FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE JUVENILE COURT AND PROBATION STATISTICAL SYSTEM- SO WE DO HAVE MARC ST PIERRE AVAILABLE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS- BUT THAT WAS JUST A BRIEF UPDATE ON A CONVERSATION THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING IN. IN THIS BUDGET COMMITTEE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THANK THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT- MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. IT I JUST WANT TO CHECK ON THE- ON AB PITINO SIX THE POLICE USE OF FORCE- THAT DEFINITELY SHOULD BE A PRIORITY OF THIS LEGISLATURE WENT THROUGH QUITE A BIT TO GET THIS LOG PLACE- IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE- THE BENCHMARK FOR ANY OTHER. FEDERAL LEVEL POLICE USE OF FORCE OR IN ANY OTHER STATE USING IT SO WHAT EVER. RESOURCES WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT NOT ONLY THAT DOJ HAS D. A. THE PERSONNEL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE AND ABLE TO GET THEIR JOB DONE SO I WOULD JUST ADD IN THEIR ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THIS THIS WORK DONE OF QUICKLY. AND COMPETENTLY AND- AND WHATEVER HELP YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT. THIS GETS DONE- YOU CAN CALL MY OFFICE. THANK YOU SELLER WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE BEING SO- TO THINK THAT THEIR COMMENTS. WE'LL HAVE THE PANEL BEGAN WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. A GOOD EVENING CARE SEEING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JEFF NEDELMAN WITH% THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I'M GOING TO PRESENT A BRIEF OVERVIEW AT THE REQUEST TO PROVIDE FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. THAT SUPPORTS COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. ASIAN MARKETS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURING THE CONTINUED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM SUCCEED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL A RECENT CHANGES INCLUDING AB NINETEEN FIFTY M. S. B. TWENTY THREE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE WORKLOAD AND RESPONSIBILITY. OF COUNTY PROBATION APARTMENTS. WE HAVE THE FUNDS TO SERVICE START UP RESOURCES TO COUNTIES. ASIAN AGENCIES COMPLEX WE SPEND IN THE MATTER MOST APPROPRIATE TO THEIR POPULATIONS THE CURRENT MEETING GAPS FOR SERVICES MAY BE DIFFERENT IN EACH COUNTY. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COUNTIES MAYBE RESOURCES AND YOU CANNOT SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE APPROPRIATE PLACEMENTS FOR YOU EQUITEC CONFIDENCE IN. OTHER COUNTIES MAY PROACTIVELY YET CASTING THEIR DAHLE POPULATION- AND PROBATION CASES SO THAT THEY CAN CONNECT INDIVIDUALS TO CASE PLANS QUICKER. OTHERS MAY WANT TO ENHANCE OR EXPAND THEIR EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS. ALEX WITT LOADED. LOW TOLD YOU CAN OUR POPULATIONS OR WITH FEW WORDS WITH SPECIALIZED NEEDS SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER OR INTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT MAY ALSO USE THIS FUNDING TO ESTABLISH REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS. WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTIES TO ENSURE AND. IT'S CHEAP EFFICIENCIES THROUGH SCALE. HAS TO BE OKAY OF FUNDS. WE ESTIMATED DON'T PROBATION. AND ACT YOU COURT WORK BUT BY LOOKING THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF COUNTY DATA. PRETTY AVERAGE CORE IT'LL PROBATION POCKET AND THEN IF YOU CAN HELP ME HOW IN THE OF JUDGE SYSTEM WITHIN. THE CALIFORNIA PART OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. ADMINISTRATION METHODOLOGY FOR COUNTY ALLOCATION WE BOTH JUVENILE. AND ADULT. OCCUPATION DATA. WE BELIEVE THAT USING THIS MIX OF THE DEBATE OUT ADULT PROBATION. TO HIS APPROACH. BECAUSE RECKITT THE WORKLOADS WITH SUPPORTING THE VARIOUS POPULATIONS SERVED BY COUNTY PROBATION DEPARTMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE USE OF HISTORICAL DATA AND FORMS THAT LOCATION INTENT IS TO PROVIDE PROVISION APARTMENTS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THESE FUNDS TO MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. THAT ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE L. A- DO YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING. THANK YOU RECREATIONAL ARE OVER THE L. A. O. BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY THE PROPOSAL KATHY PROMISED ON. THE IDEA THAT KIND OF A BASIC MARKETS LOTS OF THE RESOURCE AS WELL RECENT CHANGES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED- RELATED TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO JUST MENTION SOMEONE THAT JUVENILE JUSTICE SIDE. WAITED AS THE EIGHT TWENTY THREE WHICH IS A REAL LIFE WE HAVE A LINE IN OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE DJJ. AND MAYBE NINETEEN FIFTY WHICH THE REDUCTION IN PROBATION TERMS. HOWEVER WE HAVE FOUND THAT. THAT THEY JUST MAKE HAS NOT BEEN DONE- WHY DO WE NEED ADDITIONAL FOR THE PURPOSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU JEFF ON- THAT MONEY TO GO TO THE INTENT TO SOME OF SB TWENTY. BASED ON PAST OF THE DAY J. ROBERT THAT HAS NOT DEMONSTRATE ARE INTO SIX THE LOCAL FUNDING FOR THE ALLOCATION PLAN ABOUT WHAT THE BETWEEN THREE ANALYTICAL THAT THAT'S WHAT ALLOCATED BY THE MINISTRY HAS PROPOSED FOR THIS NEW FUNDING IT'S BASEBALL ONE COMPONENT OF THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT WAS USED IN SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE. BUT YOU CAN ALL COMPONENTS. AND THEN ADDED TO THAT THAT THE QUESTION THIS FUNDING THE NEW DOES NOT. TOPICAL WHAT THE TRUCK THIS THAT SHE- ON THAT I DON'T. SIDE SB NINETY FIFTH TRACK DECREASED RATE WORKER BECAUSE THAT WOULD. PROBATION AT STILL FROM REESE FOR PROBATION DEPARTMENT. SO NOT CLEAR WHY JUST FUNDING WOULD BE NEEDED THAT PURPOSE. IT IS TO THE PROPOSAL GOES TO LACK ANY OF ACCOUNT. MECHANISM THAT STATE THAT DOES NOT BECOME A BUILDING THAT YOUR SYSTEM IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE BANKING DEPARTMENT SEVEN SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTED PASSED PROGRAMS SUCH AS SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT WHICH IS THE GRANT PROGRAM DEMOCRATS FUNDING TO. GO TOWARDS EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND PROBATION DEPARTMENTS TOOK. PART ON HOW THE NEW STUFF. THESE ACCOUNTS MECHANISMS MECHANISM THAT BUILT INTO SB THREE. SB SIX EIGHT. LIKE BIG TO THE THAT AND SO ON WHY. SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT WOULD USED AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR WHY NO ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS ARE NOT YET BUT THE CITY PROPOSAL. ADMINISTRATION ALSO INDICATED THAT IT THINKS WORK REQUIREMENTS SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT AND SB COULDN'T VERY WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TRANSPARENCY THE PROPOSAL IT'S YEARS. FROM NOT THE SUBJECTS THAT REQUIREMENTS OF I DON'T. SB SIX SEVEN EIGHT PROGRAM OR THE S. B. TWENTY THREE POINT PROGRAMS. EXPLORATIVE THAT USE THE PROPOSED FUNDING ANY WAY THEY SEE FIT. NOT JUST FOR THE PURPOSES ARE OUTLINED IN THESE PROGRAMS. YEAH IT'S THE SIX SEVEN USD EIGHT POINT THIRTY. THE REPORT ON THE BUT I HAVE A BUILDING THAT THIS THE REPORT ON THESE PROGRAMS. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY BEARING ON PROVIDED TRANSPARENCIES BUT THE USE OF THE PROPOSED FUNDING BECAUSE RATED PARTS CONTINUES THE FUNDING AND SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY FALL UNDER THOSE REPORT REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO LACK OF JESSICA PROVIDED FOR THE PROPOSAL BY THE NUTRITION AS WELL AS ANY SORT OF ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM BUILT INTO THE PROPOSAL WE WERE CHECKED. THANK YOU. BUT THANK YOU THE ARMY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN EXPLAIN TO ME. YOUR RATIONALE- FIRST SAME THAT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR OTHER FUNDING STREAMS ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS PROPOSED BUDGET IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE ASKING THIS COMMITTEE NOT TO DO THEIR JOB- WHICH IS PART OF WHAT WE DO IS PROVIDE. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SPENDING. THANK YOU MEDICARE- EXCELLENT QUESTION JUST EIGHT OF THEM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN. WHEN WE- CREATED THE PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THE VARIOUS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING SB SIX SEVENTY EIGHT AND A JCPS S. B. MISTER RYAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RECENTLY MENTIONED AS PART OF BEING- INVOLVED WITH SB EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THERE WOULD BE SUFFICIENT. BUT WE ARE HAPPY AND SUPPORTIVE OF TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND SO WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON. I'M GOING FORWARD WITH. LOOKING INTO ADDITIONAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR THIS BUT WHAT FUNDING. THANK YOU WILL DEFINITELY TAKE YOU UP ON THAT MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST WANTED TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- TO GIVE A BRIEFING TO MY STAFF AND TO ME. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THIS IS- VERY IMPORTANT FOR ME SO IF YOU IF YOU GET ME UP TO SPEED BEFORE I MAKE A DECISION. I WOULD BE GREAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I STILL WORRY AND I BROUGHT THIS UP LAST YEAR. THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE OR ARE ON A PATH TO DO IS JUST RELYING JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT TO THE COUNTIES IN PROVIDE OF A BUNCH OF MONEY AND SAY. HAVE ADDED AND THAT WOULD BE A HUGE MISTAKE TO DO YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN LA RIGHT NOW. THAT'S ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON CREATING ITS OWN DEPARTMENT OF YOU SERVICES IN IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THAT THE CONNECTIONS ARE BEING MADE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE USED TO HELP THEM WITH THE DECISIONS THAT THEY MADE. GET THEM DRESSED RECIDIVISM PROBLEM TO GET THEM BACK INTO INTO SOCIETY AND IN A MUCH STRONGER WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE HOPE WE ARE ON THE PATH TO DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE SHIFT AWAY FROM CORRECTIONS AND INTO HUMAN SERVICES. IS I THINK A VERY GOOD STEP BUT WITHOUT A ROBUST STATEWIDE PLAN SETTING APPROPRIATE STANDARDS. HOLDING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ACCOUNTABLE. AND YES PROVIDING FUNDING OUT TO THE COUNTIES TO MEET. THEIR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THAT IS PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE CONSISTENT SERVICES TO KIDS ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S REALLY THE PATH THAT THAT WE SHOULD BE OUT SO IT'S HARD FOR TOOK TO BE A LOOK AT THIS CHUNK OF MONEY GOING OUT TO COUNTIES. KNOWING WHETHER IT'S ENOUGH KNOWING WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE KNOWING THAT WHAT THE ULTIMATE GOALS OF THIS REALIGNMENT. NEEDS TO BE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR KIDS IN THE END WHAT I WANNA MAKE SURE OF IS THAT REGARDLESS OF THE COUNTY THAT HE A CHILD IS IN WHETHER IN DEPENDENCY OR DELINQUENCY. THAT THEY'RE GETTING AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERVICES AND HELP TO SOLVE THE ISSUES THAT THEY FACE SO IT'S- WHAT SORT OF THE AGGREGATE. WAY THAT THIS IS COMING. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO KNOW WHAT THE TRACK IS THAT IF WE'RE NOT DILIGENT AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION. THAN WHAT WE'VE JUST DONE IS A REALIGNMENT AT TO THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE'S WASHING. THEIR HANDS OF IT AND THAT WOULD BE A REAL TRAGEDY BECAUSE THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE OUTCOMES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT OVER TIME. DEPENDING WHERE A CHILD IS AND THAT IS THAT IS SOMETHING WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO AVOID BECAUSE IF THAT HAPPENS THEN. THIS WHOLE EXERCISE WILL BENEFIT. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS OF MR STUNNING THING THAT SETS US UP NICELY FOR OUR NEXT AND FINAL ITEM ON THE HEARING. I WILL BE CARRYING ON THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY COMMUNITY RESTORATION AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. AND WE'LL HAVE OUR PANEL SPEAK IN THE ORDER IN WHICH IS LISTED IN THE AGENDA YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS STEPHANIE WELCH I AM THE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT THE DEPARTMENT. AT THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY AND I AM HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH THE OFFICE OF USING COMMUNITY RESTORATION WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES THREE POINT FOUR MILLION IN BUDGET YEAR AND THREE POINT ONE MILLION I'M GOING TO SUPPORT. NINETEEN STAFF AND CONTRACTS FOR SPECIALTY SERVICES SUCH AS EVALUATION EFFORTS. YOUR YOUR AGENDA FOR THE MEETING TODAY PROVIDED A VERY GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICE. SO BECAUSE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL NOT REVIEW THEM IN DETAIL HERE BUT I DO WANT TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE. IN THAT DOCUMENT. SB EIGHT TWO THREE BEGINS THE PROCESS OF CLOSING. THE DIVISION OF YOUTH JUSTICE AND REALIGNING THAT POPULATION TO THE COUNTY'S JUSTICE WHAT WAS DISCUSSED- SO THAT YOU CAN REMAIN CLOSE TO HOME. THE STATUTE ALSO ESTABLISHES THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION OR THE O. Y. C. R. AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY- THE- Y. C. R. WILL HELP TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM AND SUSTAINED SUCCESS OF TRANSITIONING RELYING USED TO COUNTY BASED CUSTODY. CUSTODY PROGRAMS AND SUPERVISION CONSISTENT WITH THE PROJECT HINGED. UPON US OF REFORMS. THANK AGREE TO THE- BY THE ARE TO HELP FILL. TO FILL THE REHABILITATIVE PURPOSE OF THE STATE'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM YOUR TRAUMA INFORMED AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PROGRAMS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL MEETS THIS OBJECTIVE SPECIFICALLY THE- I SEE ARE WILL BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEST PRACTICES POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND INTEGRATED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO BEST SUPPORT ALL JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVED YOUTH. WE WILL ACHIEVE THIS BY LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF OUR LEADERSHIP OUR STAFF AND COORDINATING WITH INITIATIVES THAT ARE UNDERWAY IN OUR VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS ACROSS START AGENCY. THE BCP WE ARE DISCUSSING. REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNDERSTANDING THAT THE- I SEE OURS SPECIFIC OVERSIGHT FUNCTIONS ARE FOCUSED ON THE REAL LINE POPULATION IT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION THAT THE- I SEE OUR ARMS BUT PERSON WILL FOCUS ON THE PORTION OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE POPULATION THAT WAS REALIGNED TO THE COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THIS INCLUDES ALL. OF THE. SEVEN SEVEN B. OFFENSE CERTAIN. YOU IRKS YOU ME YOU CERTAIN OFFENSE AS WELL AS HIGHER NEEDS YOU. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SENT TO DJJ PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE O. Y. C. R. WILL FOCUS SERVICES ON THESE UNITS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE PLACED IN JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES. AND THEY ARE OFTEN TIMES THE MOST IN NEED OF THE MOST INTENSIVE TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING. FRANKLY AND THAT. THESE ARE USED WITH A VERY HIGH NEEDS AND VERY HIGH RISK. AND FOCUSING ON THIS POPULATION. REALLY SUPPORTS ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF SB EIGHTEEN THREE. ALL UNITS ARE IMPORTANT- I BELIEVE THAT DEEP IN MY HEART IS WHY I DO THIS WORK- SHOULD THE OFFICE RECEIVED ANY KIND OF A COMPLAINT OUTSIDE THE SCOPE. SPECIFICALLY DISCUSSED JUST NOW ABOUT THE ARMS PERSONS RESPONSIBILITIES. IT IS THE ROLE OF THE LIKE THE ART DIRECTED TO THE RIGHT PLACE AND DOING THAT BY. CONVERSING WITH OUR COUNCIL AND WORKING WITH OUR OTHER DEPARTMENTS THIS IS A PART THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY HAVING THE- YC ARCHEAN HHS IS SO IMPORTANT WE HAVE CONNECTIONS TO OUR DEPARTMENTS. THOSE ARE CONNECTIONS TO CHILD WELFARE MENTAL HEALTHAND HEALTH CARE SERVICES- I WOULD ALSO ADD. THE HHS IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE VERY FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THESE YOU GET THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED DURING THIS TRANSITION. THEY HAD SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND WARRANT AS FOCUSING ON THEM AT THIS CRITICAL POINT IN TIME. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE USE THAT ARE REALIGNED AND THAT THE USE THAT WOULD HAVE GONE TO DJJ CAN STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED THE SUPERVISION THAT THEY NEED. AND THE CARE THAT THEY NEED SO THAT THEY DO NOT GRADUATE A AND FALL DEEPER INTO THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. BRIEFLY I JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE YOU UPDATES OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS. OF THE CHILD WELFARE COUNCIL HAS ESTABLISHED THE COMMITTEE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE ESTABLISHED TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE OFFICE THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. AND BE STAFFED BY HHS IN ORDER TO ADVISE AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO POLICIES PROGRAMMES APPROACHES. THAT IMPROVE USE OUTCOMES. SHE IS ATTENTION AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM FOR REALIGNED YOU WE HAVE BEGUN TO MEET- OF OUR FIRST MEETING WAS LAST MONTH- COUNTIES WILL RECEIVE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT GRANT FUNDS. BY FILING A PLAN WITH THE OFFICE NO LATER THAN JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE O. Y. C. R. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THESE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT THEY INCLUDE ALL STATUTORILY REQUIRED ELEMENTS. IF THE PLAN DOES NOT IT CAN BE RETURNED TO THE COUNTY- AND IN ORDER TO RECEIVE CONTINUED FUNDING. THE COUNTY WILL HAVE TO SUBMIT A PLAN. NO LATER THAN MAY FIRST OF EACH YEAR. ALSO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS A ROLE TO PLAY. IN DEVELOPING A PLAN TO MODERNIZE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE DATABASE AND REPORTING SYSTEM BY JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE NEW PLAN WILL INCLUDE DATA AND OUTCOME MEASURES NEEDED TO PRODUCE RECIDIVISM REPORTS AND TO ARGUMENT CASELOAD AND PLACEMENT CHANGES DUE TO THE REALIGNMENT OF DJJ TO THE COUNTIES. WE WILL ALSO USE THAT THE- I SEE ARE. THESE ELEMENTS TO ASSESS COUNTY PLANS FOR COMPLETENESS IN ADDITION. TO DEVELOPING EVALUATION TOOLS- INCLUDES I JUST TO SAY THE HOUSING THE- I SEE ARE AT HHS WILL FACILITATE LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF OUR VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS- WHO ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING CHILDREN'S OUTCOMES IN LIFE'S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. AND SPECIAL OFFICES LIKE THE OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL ALL OF THESE CAN SUPPORT THE- I SEE IT- I SEE ARE IN ITS EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES. WE ENVISION SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN A Y. C. R. AND THESE DEPARTMENTS TO WRITE STRONG AND EFFECTIVE CONNECTIONS TO LOCAL IMPLEMENTERS. WHO IT WAS BONTA FOR SERVING THESE YOUTH IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND TO BRING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. SO WITH THAT I CAN TAKE ACTION- WE ALSO- I KNOW WITH OTHER PANELISTS HERE AS WELL. THANK YOU MISS WORKING FROM MY OTHER PANELISTS BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. SHE'S STICKING AROUND. NEXT PANELIST. YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS FRANKIE BECAUSE MINE. I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE YOUTH JUSTICE INITIATIVE AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUR LONG SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF. THE LEGISLATURE IN XP TWENTY THREE. WELL LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GULF OF UNDERSTANDING TO LAW SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY THREE. PER CENT TO MOTIONS THE CLOSURE OF DJJ THEREBY TRANSFERRING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SERVING ALL YOUTH AND CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO THE COUNTIES. PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT FUNDING TO COUNTIES TO CARRY OUT THIS PLAN. RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE NEED FOR OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTIES USE OF STATE FUNDING AND FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALL INCARCERATED YOUTH. SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY THREE ALSO ESTABLISHED THE OFFICE OF YOUTH YOU THE COMMUNITY RESTORATION OR ALL I SEE ARE. TO OVERSEE THE ENTIRE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ACROSS THE FIFTY POUNDS. SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY THREE CLEARLY OUTLINES THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE O. Y. C. R. TO INCLUDE STATE OVERSIGHT OF ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEMS ACROSS THE FIFTY POUNDS. ADMINISTRATION OF THE REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING AND EVENTUALLY ALL OF THE STATE'S JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANT PROGRAMS. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING ON OUTCOMES FOR ALL YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IDENTIFYING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO BEST SUPPORT ALL YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND IDENTIFYING AND DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES AGAIN FOR ALL YOU IN THE YOUTH IN HE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL YOUTH IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND TO ESTABLISH AN OMBUDSPERSON TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS FROM ALL INCARCERATED YOUTH THEIR FAMILIES STAFF AND OTHERS ABOUT THE HARMFUL CONDITIONS PRACTICES AND VIOLATIONS OF LAW IN LOCAL FACILITIES. IN EXPECT. INEXPLICABLY THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION NOW SEEKS TO DEPART FROM THE STATE LAW. FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OWN COMMITMENT TO MOVE CALIFORNIA YOUTH JUSTICE SYSTEM TOWARDS A HEALTH BASED MODEL IMPORTANT WAYS. FIRST THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION THE TRADITION OF SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY THREE SEVERELY LIMITED SCOPE OF THE L. Y. C. R. IN WHICH MANY OF ITS CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITIES. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DEVELOP AND EXPAND LOCAL DIVERSION OPPORTUNITIES AND TO IDENTIFY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED OUTCOMES AND INTEGRATED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES TO BEST SUPPORT ALL DELINQUENT YOUTH. ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION'S INTERPRETATION OF AB SB TWENTY THREE DRAMATICALLY LIMITS THE SCOPE OF. THE OUTLETS PERSON'S ROLE AMHERST ACTIVITIES INCLUDING. ITS PROTECTION. TO ONLY WITH. EFFECTS OR USEFUL OTHER WOULD HAVE INCARCERATED DJJ PRIOR TO THOUSAND SEVEN. HOWEVER STATE LAW IT'S CLEAR THAT ALL YOUTH IN JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM FACILITIES WILL BE PROVIDED WITH THE PROTECTIONS OF THE OMBUDSPERSON. THE MINISTRATIONS OF ROHINGYAS INTERPRETATION OF CLEARLY DEFINED LAW IF IMPLEMENTED WOULD BE ILLEGAL AND WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN MISUSE OF STATE FUNDS. THE MALTREATMENT OF VULNERABLE COURSE FIFTIETH AND COSTLY EDUCATION TO CORRECT ANY DEFICIENCIES OR ABUSES THAT OCCUR I DON'T LOCAL PRACTICES THAT RESULT FROM A LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REQUEST ONLY NINETEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND METER THREE POINT. IN THE DOCK- THE. GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION. TWENTY ONE POINT IN EVERYTHING RECORD TWO THOUSAND OPERATE DEAL C. R. WHETHER A RESULT OF THE MESSENGER OF CLEARLY DEFINED LAW OR AN ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO OVERSEE SUPPORT AND HOLD ACCOUNTABLE COUNTY SYSTEMS THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION'S NARROW INTERPRETATION AND PROPOSED UNDER RESOURCING OF LIFE WE ARE MUST BE CORRECTED. I URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAINTAIN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COUNTIES PRACTICES AND SUPPORT THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE ENTIRE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE WELL BEING OF ALL OF YOUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN IN THAT SYSTEM- AND FULLY RESOURCE IN ALL I SEE ARE. TO CARRY OUT ALL OF ITS DUTIES THANK YOU. NEXT HOLLISTER. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS DOMINIQUE NANA DIRECTOR OF YOUTH JUSTICE POLICY AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA I TRULY APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL AND ONE THAT ITS WHOLLY INSUFFICIENT THE DRAMATIC UNDER ESTIMATE IN STAFFING AND FUNDING APPEARS TO BE THE RESULT OF TWO THINGS A WRONG INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW REGARDING- I SEE OUR SCOPE AS MR BECAUSE MINE EXPLAINED. AS WELL AS A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR- I SEE ARTS FULFILL ITS DUTIES WITH FIDELITY TO ITS MISSION. THIS PROPOSAL CREATES A SHELL OF AN AGENCY. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD. HAS NEARLY FIVE TIMES. FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROPOSED FOR- I SEE ARE. AN AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SAFETY AND TREATMENT OF THOUSANDS OF OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. I'D LIKE TO GIVE THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW GROSSLY MISGUIDED THIS PROPOSAL IS. FIRST WILL NEED TO STAFF ARE ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE CONCERNS FROM INCARCERATED YOUTH THEIR FAMILIES AND STAFF ACROSS CALIFORNIA. FOR PERSPECTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AT MORE THAN SIXTEEN THOUSAND YOU WERE SECURELY DETAINED INSIDE NINETY FACILITIES STAFF BY THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES THAT'S TO STAFF TO ENSURE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE SAFE AND SUPPORTED. SECOND THERE'S ONLY ONE DATA SPECIALIST TWO RESEARCH AND ANALYZE PROGRAM OUTCOMES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THAT'S ONE DEDICATED STAFF MEMBER TO MEET THE STATED GOAL OF HHS TO HAVE RESEARCH AND DATA DRIVE ITS ACTIONS AND DRIVE ITS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. AND FINALLY- I SEE ARE IS FUNDAMENTAL IN. THAT THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FULLER IS THAT THE STATE IS INVESTING PRODUCES POSITIVE OUTCOMES. YET ONLY THREE STAFF AND IT'S ABOUT PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES AND DEVELOPING THEIR SPENDING PLANS. AND THAT'S THREE STAFF TO THOROUGHLY REVIEW AND THEN POSSIBLY RETURNED FOR REVISION PLANS FROM FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF NINETEEN COUNTIES AND PLANS PER PERSON. AND WE'RE OVER THIS PROPOSAL MADE IT NO MATTER GEN OF THE STAFF NEEDED TO IMMEDIATELY COLLABORATE WITH THE BOARD OF STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANTS AND THEN TO EVENTUALLY TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THESE GRANTS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE NUMBER OF PROPOSED STAFF POSITIONS IS UNQUESTIONABLY TOO LOW REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH SUPPORT THE STAFF WERE SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE FROM THEIR TEAM MEMBERS ARE FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN HHS. AND IT'S FAR BELOW COMPARABLE OVERSIGHT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONWIDE. MORE STAFF IS FULLY MORE STAFF FULLY DEDICATED TO DISTINCT WAYS YOUR DUTIES AS SORT SORELY NEEDED. AND MORE RESOURCES TO EQUIP THE STAFF TO FULLY PERFORM THEIR DUTIES IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT REALIGNMENT DOESN'T HARM AND IN FACT ADVANCES THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE A COMMENTS FROM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS IS ALLISON YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENT AT THIS TIME I DO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE IF YOU JUST AGENCY HAS A CHANCE TO SPEAK AND HAPPY TO ADD ON. AS WELL. GO AHEAD. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO REST WAIT FOR QUESTIONS OR TO RESPOND TO THE PANELISTS. THAT GROUP. WEBER QUESTIONS. AFTER L. ALE. MARK MORROW WITH THE L. A. O. WE COULD NOT RAISE CONCERNS BUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL WE ARE FROM THE HAPPY REYES MY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON IT. I WOULD HOPE THAT. YOU MOVED TO THE GRANT FROM THE FCC TWO- I SEE ARE WOULD BE OCCURRING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX AN HOUR SOMEBODY STARTS AND THEN BE A SIXTY. ACCORDING TO PORTANTINO'S PROGRAM THAT NOT CLEAR THAT WOULD ALL BE PLAY OUT IT IS COULD NOT BACKYARD. I WILL BE BACK TO- TO SPEAK TO THEIR UP TO. MAKE IT. AT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT ARE. WE START OFF WITH THE QUESTION FOR. THE ADVOCATES ARE IN YOUR COMMON STARTED TO TOUCH ON THIS- ALREADY. WHAT IN YOUR OPINION WHAT WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RESOURCES FOR THIS OFFICE. THIS IS DOMINIQUE NOW AND I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION AND SO BASED ON CONSULTATION WITH BUDGET EXPERTS AND OUR RESEARCH INTO COMPARABLE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT A MINIMUM TO KEEP SIX POSITIONS ARE NEEDED. THAT COULD BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT FIFTY SIX AT A MINIMUM. KK BAKER HAD A BREAK THAT DOWN A LITTLE MORE PRESS. SURE SO WE COMPILED STAFFING ESTIMATES FOR EACH OF THE PRIMARY FUNCTIONS OF- I SEE OUR AND WE AND WE GIVE A RANGE FOR FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF STACKING CONFIGURATIONS. SO WITH REGARD TO THE OMBUDSMAN DUTIES I WE HAVE ESTIMATED THIRTEEN SEVENTEEN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND THIS IS AFTER WE LOOKED AT THE TEXAS JUVENILE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICE OF THE INDEPENDENT ADVANCEMENT AND THEY ALSO HAVE THIRTEEN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT DATA FOR WHICH WE CAN MAKE COMPARISONS WE CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF YOUTH IN JUVENILE FACILITIES IN TEXAS AS IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT TEXAS HAS SLIGHTLY FEWER. THAT'S BURKE IS WHAT'S YOUR BIRTHDATE IT OUT CATION ABOUT ACCIDENT. EGGMAN SPEAK PLEASE I WAS BASED ON THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE THEY HAVE AN OFFICE THAT RESURGENT DATE INTEGRITY HE THAT HAS EIGHTEEN FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND GETTING CAUGHT CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION INSIDE YOU PROFITABILITY'S IS ACTUALLY ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF FLORIDA'S. I WITH THE GUARDS TO EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF LOCAL PROGRAMS AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTIES WE ALSO ESTIMATE SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY THREE F. T.'S AND AGAIN THAT'S BASED ON THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PROGRAMMING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DEPARTMENT WHICH HAS TEN AND AGAIN WE HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED I'M THOSE NUMBERS AS IN FLORIDA. AND FINALLY AS FAR AS THE GRANT ADMINISTRATION IT WE ARE ESTIMATING A MINIMUM OF EIGHT- AND UP TO TEN F. T. E.'S AND THIS IS BASED ON LOOKING AT THE FORTY STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS THEY HAVE A CORRECTIONS PLANNING GRANT PROGRAM DIVISION THAT HAS TWENTY SEVEN F. T. E.'S FOR EIGHTEEN ACTED GRANT PROGRAMS. AND- I SEE ARE WILL ADMINISTER BOTH THE NEW REALIGNMENT BLOCK GRANTS AS WELL AS ALL JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANTS CURRENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE BCC SEVEN MOUNTS TO AT A MINIMUM SEVEN JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANT EVENTUALLY AND THEN THEY HAVE TO COORDINATE WITH THE BCC ON ADDITIONAL SEVEN GRANTS THAT SUPPORT BOTH ADULT AND JUVENILE RELATED PROGRAMS SO ALL OF THOSE. WOULD ADD UP TO AT A MINIMUM FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU FOR THE- OF HOW AND SERVE- CAL. HAS THE LARGEST JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. AND GIVEN THE COMMENTS FROM THE ADVOCATES- AND ALEJO. IN YOUR OPINION. THREE MILLION INSUFFICIENT TO SET UP. THE OFFICE THAT WILL HAVE THE SUBSTANCE AND BE ABLE TO PERFORM ITS DUTY. WE DID AN ASSESSMENT AND I THINK IF YOU. I WANTED TO AND I REALLY APPRECIATE- S. THE ADVOCACY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT WANTING TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED- RBC P. AS I MENTIONED AT HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- INTERPRETATION OF THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICE OF THE- PERSON- AND THAT'S- AND- WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN MULTIPLE STAFF PEOPLE WORKING ON THAT I KNOW THERE WAS A MENTION THAT THERE WERE TWO STAFF THAT WERE. DEDICATED TO THAT POSITION BUT I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WE'VE ORGANIZED OUR ORG CHART INTO UNITS THAT REPORT TO AN EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF WHICH OF COURSE IS WHERE WE'LL HAVE OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AS WELL AS ON THE COUNCIL AND WE WOULD ENVISIONED TO PEOPLE BEING FULLY DEDICATE TO RECEIVING THOSE BUT IT REALLY WILL BE THE WORK OF THE OFFICE TO DETERMINE- OUT TO ASSESS REFER- IN MANY CASES THEY WILL BE GOING BACK LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE FACILITIES AND THE ADMINISTRATORS AND TRYING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE LOCALLY. BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL YOU KNOW THAT WE WANT. OUR COUNTY IMPLEMENT TO BE. AND THAT IS REALLY OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AT THIS TIME THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE SHIFT IN POLICY. UP FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL NO LONGER BE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE WHICH CURRENTLY SERVES AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED USE. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE USE OF ARE TAKING CARE OF AND ANY USE THAT WOULD HAVE. HAD DJJ- AS AN OPTION IN THE FUTURE HAVE THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND SO THAT'S REALLY OUR LASER FOCUS. AT THIS TIME- CERTAINLY WE BELIEVE WITHIN. THE OFFICE BUT ALSO IN LEVERAGING THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF OUR VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. WERE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF WORK IN THIS AREA I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO COORDINATE THAT WORK I THINK WE FEEL THE OFFICE. IS AN OFFICE IN ITS RESPONSIBILITY WOULD BE TO COORDINATE DEPARTMENTS IN THAT WAY SO- WE'VE GOT WORK GOING ON AT DEPARTMENTS SOCIAL SERVICES WITH OUR SYSTEM OF CARE WORK. OBVIOUSLY A CONTINUUM OF CARE. FOR MARK WITH OUR FOSTER CARE YOUTH. WE'RE DOING IT WORK WITH CD AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS OUTSIDE OF OUR OFFICE- WILL BE COLLABORATING WITH THE COUNCIL ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REALLY FOCUSES ON. THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS OF JUVENILE JUSTICE POPULATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SO. I DO THINK I AM. WE REALLY DO A STEP INFILL AT THIS TIME- THAT. THE POSITIONS THAT WE BASS FOR AND THE ONGOING CONTRACTING FUNDS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE. I WOULD REALLY BE A SUFFICIENT. I HAVE THE MORE QUESTIONS THAT ON THE NOTE WAIT OFTEN SEE OF MY COLLEAGUES COME WITH A MISTER JONES SAWYER. THANK YOU- AVERAGE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M EXTREMELY. CONCERNED ABOUT- ESPECIALLY. SINCE WE'VE ALREADY- LAST WEEK EXPERIENCE WHEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. CALLED THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS. AND THEY TOLD US. QUITE FRANKLY THAT WE'RE THE ONES THAT SET THEM UP AND IF THERE'S ANY DEFICIENCIES IN WHAT THEY DO IS THE LEGISLATURE THAT MESSED IT UP IF THE GOVERNOR THAT MESSED IT UP BECAUSE WHERE I DIDN'T GET ENOUGH RESOURCES INTO GIVEN ENOUGH MONEY OR A STORY THE BE ABLE TO HANDLE THEIR TASK FOR WHICH WE BELIEVE. THAT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. I'M GETTING UP EARLY FEELING IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH THAT THE OFFICE OF YOUTH AND COMMUNITY RESTORATION MAYBE GOING DOWN THAT SAME PATH. AND SO I'M SAYING THAT SO YOU KNOW IN THE CONTEXT OF WHY WE'RE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS NOW WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY. I NOW HAVE THE TASK OF EITHER ELIMINATING B. S. C. C. RESTRUCTURING BE SEC OR DOING SOMETHING WITH IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OR I NEED TO RESEARCH WHAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO DO. NOT TAKING SURVEYS AND CINEMA PUNDITS ON A ON A IN A SHELL IT'S BELIEVED THAT THEY WOULD BE OVERSIGHT. AND SO WHAT EVER WE NEED BECAUSE THE ANIMAL BLAME COLLECTED EFFICIENT BECAUSE I AM ONE NOW. ELECTED OFFICIALS LOVE TO MAKE LAWS. BUT WERE NOT GOOD AT IMPLEMENTATION. OF GIVING STAFF ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB. AND SO. WHAT I NEED FROM THE ADVOCATES. WHAT THEY BELIEVE. AND I MEAN AROUND THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING TO YOU DURING THE ALPHABET SOUP OF A- OF RESOURCES F. T. E.'S IN. AB SEASON HERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS A LOT I NEED A BOTTOM LINE NUMBER YOU NEED TWENTY MILLION FIFTY MILLION. R. THREE MILLION I DON'T IT IN ON THIS RIGHT NOW GOT ALL THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THAT TOTAL AMOUNT IS. BECAUSE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE YOU NEED AND WE HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE OUT WITH THIS NEW HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY OR Y. C. R. NEEDS. MAYBE HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WE TRULY NEED TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND I FROM L. A. COUNTY AS A AS THE CHAIRS FROM L. A. COUNTY. WE WILL BE MOST IMPACTED IF THIS EXPERIMENT DOESN'T WORK LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN WE WILL BE MOST IMPACTED IF THIS EXPERIMENT DOESN'T. WORK AND SHALL WE SHOULD NOT. NOT GIVE. EVERYONE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND SO WHAT I NEED. PROBABLY FROM BOTH OF YOU IS ONE FOR ME ADVOCATES. WHICH YOU BELIEVE IS NEEDED TO MAKE TO SUCCESSFUL AND THAT AND A BOTTOM LINE COSTS. AND IF THIS IS YOUR FINAL ANSWER FROM THE INTERNAL. SIDE WITH OUR OUR BUREAUCRACY- LET IT LET IT BE SO BUT IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE. THAT MAYBE YOU NEED SOME MORE RECESSED SOURCES TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. I DON'T CARE IF YOU WHISPER IN MY EAR I WILL TELL THE GOVERNOR YOU TOLD ME. JUST LET ME KNOW. WHICH TRULY TRULY NEED TO MAKE THIS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM PROGRAM YOU CAN TELL ME NOW OR MY OFFICE. WHATEVER WORKS BEST FOR EITHER SIDE. BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE NEXT MEMBER THE SEVEN ANYONE ONE ANSWER NOW OR YOU'RE GONNA. ANSWER LATER. I WILL TELL THE GOVERNOR. RIGHT NOW AND THEN I. I'VE I APPRECIATE THAT I DO RESPECT IT BUT AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME AT NINETEEN POSITIONS THAT WE'VE ASKED FOR AND THE FUNDING LEVEL THAT WE'VE REQUESTED. IS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS IN STATUTE. OKAY CAN COME TO MY OFFICE AND THEN IN EXPLAINED TO ME IN DETAIL WHY YOU BELIEVE THAT SO THAT'S- RIGHT BECAUSE IT HOURS LATER ON HOLD UP EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A SYSTEM. BAKER AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH THAT ENDING WITH WELLS. YOU HAVE A LOT OF ADVOCACY HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE AND WANTING TO HELP IT LOOKS LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS. COME LIGHTLY INTERPRETED OR INCORRECTLY INTERPRETED WHAT THE SCOPE I THINK OF YOUR ORGANIZATION IS SUPPOSED TO DO. AND WE ALL THINK IT NEEDS TO BE MORE OF US HERE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TASK AHEAD N. WHAT'S BEING ASKED IS. IT'S NOT JUST WORKING WITH THE COUNTY'S BECAUSE- NOT EVERY COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. ALL OF THE SERVICES FOR THOSE KIDS. SOME HAVE TO BE DONE REGIONALLY ACCREDITED HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK TOGETHER. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE RAISED. AND WILL NEED SOME SIGNIFICANT GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE AB HELPED IN PUTTING SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS TOGETHER. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AND THEN EVEN JUST DEALING WITH IN YOUR OWN AGENCY. AS WE SAW WITH CC ARE THE CONTINUING CARE REFORM. GETTING D. HUMAN SERVICES SIDE ESPECIALLY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKING WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE THE HUMAN SERVICES SIDE WAS NOT VERY EASY TO DO BECAUSE THEY WERE SO VERY DIFFERENT PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT THE MISSIONS WERE AND WHAT. THE SENSE OF OUTCOMES WERE GOING TO BE SO I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX TO DO AND AS SOON AS YOU START TASKING THOSE OTHER. YOUR SOURCE SISTER AGENCIES WITHIN HHS THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING FOR MONEY AND MAYBE THAT'S COMES OUT OF A DIFFERENT BUDGET SO MAYBE WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE. THOSE THOSE REQUESTS COME UP. BUT FOR ME I'D RATHER SEE YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE AND RESOURCES. TO TRULY BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND IF IT'S A QUESTION ABOUT. SCOPE AND HOW MUCH AUTHORITY YOU HAVE VERSUS WHAT WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE. AN ABSOLUTELY CLARIFY WE DID IN FACT TRY TO GET MORE THORNY THE OMBUDSPERSON. THAN I THINK WAS THERE BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE REST OF YOUR STAFF. HAVING APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT IN PEOPLE TO PERFORM ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS AND PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES AND THAT BACK COMMON STANDARD. AMONG ALL OF THE COUNTIES OF WHAT WE EXPECT THEM WHEN THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR KIDS ACROSS STATE IS REALLY WHAT WE'RE- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO I THINK YOU'RE HEARING SOME SKEPTICISM ON OUR PART THAT YOU'VE BUILT ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE YOUR INTERNAL MACHINATIONS ARE COULD ONLY IMAGINE ABOUT WITH DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND OTHERS. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL YOU HAVE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WITH THIS AND WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES THAT THE COUNTIES ARE GETTING OF RESOURCES YOU'RE GETTING ENOUGH RESOURCES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS ALL WORKS SO YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING SOME SKEPTICISM ON OUR SIDE THANK IN THIS LOOKS A LITTLE THIN. FOR WHAT OUR EXPECTATION OF. YOUR AGENCY IS. N. I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE EXPECTING WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING. AND IF NOT THEN. WE DEFINITELY NEED TO SORT THAT OUT. SO HELP HELP US HELP YOU. THANK YOU I WILL TAKE THAT BACK THANK. WE APPRECIATE THAT AND I WILL CERTAINLY TAKE THAT BACK. THANK YOU FOR ME WE CARE FROM ALL OF US HERE IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT HOW AGES- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAME UP WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE FINDING IT AT A- PROPER LEVEL. OF MOST OF OUR HEARINGS HAVE BEEN ABOUT- WHY ASKING US FOR SO MUCH MONEY AND THINK THAT THEY WERE ASKING WHY ARE YOU ASKING THIS FOR SO LITTLE MONEY. WHICH IS THE RARE POSITION TO BE IN- AS I DO WANT TO. POINT THAT OUT- AND SO WITH THAT I GUESS IT DID TRY TO CLARIFY SOME SOME OF THAT CONFUSION TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THAT CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU TOLD YOUR STAFF AT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE OFFICE WAS CREATED WITH. I'LL JUST HAVE AN AFFAIR. WITH AN ARAB. OF ONLY DJJ YOUTH. THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION BUT- HE THERE ARE DIFFERENT- FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE OFFICE I THINK THAT IN TERMS OF OUR POLICY ROLES AND IN TERMS OF PROMOTING AND DISSEMINATING BEST PRACTICES. AND THAT IS VERY CLEARLY OUTLINED IN STATUTE TO BE FOR THE BROADER LARGER SYSTEM AND ALL USED IT MAYBE JUSTICE INVOLVED BUT FOR THIS PECIFIC ROLES AROUND THE HONEST PERSON AND THAT OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT THAT IS VERY NARROWLY FOCUSED- IN OUR BELIEF ON THE RELAUNCH POPULATION. ASKING ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. I THINK THAT FIRST TO ANSWER OUR QUESTION AND SO GIVEN THAT YOU ARE NOT LETTING US KNOW THAT YOU DO THINK THAT IT'S WIDER AT THINK AGAIN THAT THE DOLLAR MONTH STILL SEEMS QUESTIONABLE AND SO I WOULD THINK THAT THAT THE COMMITTEES REQUESTING AN UPDATED B. C. P. THAT'S BASED ON THE DUTIES ARE LAID OUT IN THE STATUTE- EARLIER YOU SAID THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT WHICH YOU SUBMIT IT WITH. THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT WE WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT. INK MAYBE FITS OUR INTERPRETATION IS THAT'S A LITTLE BIT BETTER. THIS IS ALLISON YOUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I MAY ADD ON TO MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS VERY QUICKLY SO. THIS IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD IN TERMS OF WHAT WE THINK HOW. WE WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL TAKE. IT WILL TAKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT IMPLEMENTING THE SAME OFFICE I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS INTERPRETING THE STATUTE BUT WE REALLY SAW THE OFFICES AS HAVING TO CORPS OVERSIGHT COMPONENTS. AND I WOULD HAVE MY COLLEAGUE FILL IN ANY GAPS THAT I MISS UN BUT WE SEE IT ALL RIGHT- REVIEW OF THE PLANS AS IT PERTAINS TO THAT I SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY YOUTH THAT ARE CURRENTLY HOUSING DJ THAT WOULD BE REALIGNED TO THE COUNTY IS. AND THE REALIGNMENT OF THE CRANE STARTING JULY FIRST FINE AND THEN WE SEE AT THE PRINCE OF THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON THAT'S- THE WHOLE GOAL HERE OF THE REALIGNMENT AND PUTTING THE YOUTH BACK AT THE COUNTIES IS BECAUSE WE SEE MORE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES. AND SO WHEN THERE'S A CORE BELIEF THAT THE COUNTY IS I IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATED WOULD BE ABLE TO SERVE THESE YOUTH AND HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SERVING YOU'VE PREVIOUSLY. AND SO. THAT'S I THINK WHERE WHERE THERE'S A I NEED A DISAGREEMENT IS WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THE OMBUDSPERSON FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE VISION HERE IS THAT. AND THEY OMBUDSPERSON IS THERE TO REALLY FOCUS ON THAT YOU THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDS WHICH ARE THAT THE REAL LINES POPULATIONS. AND INCLUDING THE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE REALIGNED UNDER SB EIGHT TO THREE AND IF THEY WERE TO GET OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER YOUTH THEY'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE HELPING THOSE AT INDIVIDUALS AND- IT DIDN'T FIRE YOU DON'T POINTS OF CONTACT WHETHER IT'S AT THE COUNTY LEVEL OR OTHERWISE WHERE THEY CAN HAVE THEIR COMPLAINTS ADDRESSED. I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE OMBUDSPERSON DO WITHIN THE OFFICE AND THAT THE FOCUS THERE AND THE INTENTIONAL. FOCUS OF THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ON THE REAL LINE POPULATIONS I II THE HIGHEST NEED YOU WITH BUT BUT NO YOU WITH IS GOING TO GO ON THE SERVER IT'S JUST ABOUT CONNECTING THEM TO THE RESOURCES. AND THAT WILL BE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN TERMS OF ANY COMPLAINTS THAT ARISE. I JUST WANTED TO ADD IN THAT COMMENTED IDON'T KNOW IF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE H. AGENCY AS AN- ELSE ADD. THAT IS CORRECT BECAUSE OF THE ARE RISKS. IS ALSO TO REFER. THOSE USED TO A PLACE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY CAN GET THE HELP THAT THEY NEED AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT VARIOUS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE OTHER HONEST PERSONS- CERTAINLY AGAIN YOU KNOW. IF ANYTHING AGREE JUST A LEGAL YOU KNOW TERRIBLE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ADDRESS THOSE THOSE PARTICULAR ISSUES- BUT AGAIN. WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON THESE KIDS THESE ARE THE KIDS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE IN THE ACTUAL GIVEN OUT TO SPECIFICALLY- AND THEN THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE RECEIVING EXTENSIVE TREATMENTS AND SO I THINK THAT IT JUST MAKES I THINK WE THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO REALLY. FOCUSED ON THE KIDS WHO NEED- WE NEED. TO GERMANICA COMMENT. THE SERVICE LINE IT WAS NOT HAVE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW I WILL LET YOU MAKE. IT I MEAN I. YEAH I'M- HERE I'LL TALK ABOUT. INTERPRETATIONS AND LANDREAU WHY DOES INTERPRET INTERPRETATIONS WERE MADE WHEN ALL THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHO. HAD ANY INTENTION WHEN THEY DRAFTED THIS LANGUAGE AND GO STRAIGHT WE HAVE AND IT IS CLEAR AND WORK AND WE'RE TELLING THEM HE ATTENTION WAS THAT THIS BE A ROBUST OFFICE WITH A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT STATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. WHO NEEDS SUPPORT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL KIDS IN OUR STATE AND IF WE HAVE AN UNDERFUNDED OVERSIGHT ENTITY WITH A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES THINGS ARE GOING TO GO WRONG AND LYFT WILL BE HARMED IF NOT. PEOPLE WILL BE KILLED RIGHT AND SO FOR PEOPLE TO SUGGEST. THAT BABY NIPPLE AT ALL AND ARE ASKING THE QUESTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE PEOPLE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS LOG OUT. IT'S JUST WRONG I THINK IT SHOWS A LACK OF COMMUNITY IN A LACK OF. ACCOUNTABILITY WE NEED TO GET THIS RIGHT EQUITIES JONES SAWYER SAID AND SO I THINK WE DO NEED TO MAYBE. GO BACK TO SCHOOL READ THE STATUTE. FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WORDS. MEAN AND- THEN FROM THAT. FIT THE PLAN. BUT THIS IDEA THAT WE- BE MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE ARE NARROWING THE SCOPE. OF WHAT WE THINK THIS STATUTES SAID WHEN THAT IN FACT NOT THE REALITY. IS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE KIDS WHO NEED THIS HELP. THINGS WILL HAPPEN AND IT'LL BE. ON EVERYBODY'S HANDS THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING IS THESE THESE ARE NOT QUESTIONS THAT CAN'T BE ANSWERED THE LEGISLATURE ZERO INFORMED. THE ADVOCATES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE WERE ALL INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION WE KNOW VERY WELL WHAT WE INTENDED TO HAVE WHAT WE LEGISLATIVE. IT'S IN PRINT. AND SO THERE'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW TALKING CIRCLES I JUST THINK IT IS NOT A GOOD USE OF TIME AND JUST BE HONEST. THE STATE IS LISTENING. AND WE NEED A LOCAL Y. C. R. DID WAS JOB I NEED TO BE WELL FUNDED. AND IF YOU KNOW OVERSEE OUR TAKE THE POSITION THAT THEY CAN DO MORE WITH LESS THAN. MY LAST COMMENT WOULD BE THAT MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO PROBATION. SYSTEMATICALLY MORE WITH LESS AS WELL- A THANK YOU IT IS. IT'S LATE HOUR. AT HERE TODAY SO I AM- THEN I LET THAT BE A PART OF RECKLESS AND COMMENTATORS- REALLY URGE H. A. S. S. AND THE- I HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO GET ON THE SAME PAGE I THINK OUR COMMON GOAL IS ENSURING THAT OUR KIDS ARE PROTECTED THAT OUR KIDS ARE NOT JUST PROTECTED AND NOT TO SERVE BUT WE'RE FINDING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP THEM. BE THE LEADERS THAT WE KNOW THEY CAN BE AND MOVE FORWARD IN LIFE OUT THERE AND SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE- IT'S BEEN WORK THAT'S BEEN ONGOING FOR A WHILE AND SO I THINK IT'S CLEAR WE'RE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT SOME CONVERSATIONS TO GET US THERE BETWEEN NOW AND US HAVING A FINAL BUDGET PROPOSAL. AS WELL OUT THERE. AND SO I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME TO LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS- WE HAVE SOME VERY PASSIONATE MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND SO I DO. RECOMMEND YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OFFERS TO WORK WITH YOU DIRECTLY. I TO GET IT RIGHT. AND TO MAKE SURE WE HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS ALL OF OUR- ALL OF OUR KIDS OUT THERE. THANK YOU.

HI MY NAME IS THE RESULT OF THE WITH THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABILITY TO PAY ITEM. AND YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS THAT JOB THE LATE BEING CALIFORNIA JUST A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR THE BOOK THAT. IS MORE THAN WHAT NEARLY EVERY OTHER STATE WITH AVAILABLE DATA CHARGES FOR A TRAFFIC TICKET. AND IT WILL AFFECT OUR DEEPLY RELEASE TO THE ABILITY TO PAY- EXPANSION AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS. IN VERY GOOD FAITH PROPOSING BECAUSE- IF YOU LOOK AT IT FOR EXAMPLE SOLANO COUNTY ADOPTED AN ABILITY TO PAY PROGRAM AND- NEAR IN NEARLY EVERY CASE MORE THAN 90% OF CASES. THEY RETAINED AT LEAST THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WORK ON UNABLE TO PAY THEY KEPT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THE BUT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TRUMP OF WHAT THEY OWE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL ASSESSMENT. WE SEE THAT IN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE BEING. PUNISHED FOR IT ABILITY TO PAY AND THE PERSON IN A TRAFFIC FINE LEVEL FAR BEYOND THAT THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THE ORIGINAL. AND THE ABILITY TO PAY PENSION. OTHER THAN FLOOD WON'T. POP UP UNFORTUNATELY. I ALL THE EFFORT PUT IN BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IMPLEMENTATION NUMBERS SHOW THAT BROAD DISPARITIES BETWEEN COUNTY ILL AND SPELL THAT. OUT FOR YOU. NEXT PERSON. NINE ONE FIFTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE THAT DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO SPEAK ON ITEM TWO FIFTY ISSUE TO. ME RESPECTFULLY REQUESTS THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE REJECTED THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ABILITY TO PAY PILOT PROGRAM AND INSTEAD WE ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO THE ABOLISHMENT OF THE SIMPLE ASSESSMENT CREEK. CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC FINES AND FEES ARE SOME OF THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY AND INCLUDES A PARTICULARLY HIGH BURDEN ON BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. WELL CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ONLINE EDUCATION PROGRAM DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE GOALS IT SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH IN PARTICULAR DUE TO BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE RELIEF FOR ALL WHO NEED IT. SECOND THE PROGRAM LEAD TO INADEQUATE REDUCTIONS FOR THOSE WHO USE THAT AND LASTLY THE PILOT PROGRAM ALSO ALLOWS WIDELY DIVERGENT PRACTICES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. WITH THIS IN MIND THE BEST WAY TO PROMOTE AFFORDABILITY EQUITY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC COURT IS TO ELIMINATE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FEE ALTOGETHER TO THE EXTENT THAT A LIMITING. ELIMINATING CIVIL ASSESSMENTS WOULD REDUCE COURT REVENUES WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE THE BUDGETED FUNDS TO ADDRESS THAT SHORTFALL RATHER THAN TO FUND THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PROGRAM THANK YOU SO MUCH.
