LIKE TO ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO PLEASE HOLD ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF EACH PANEL AND WITH THAT YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED THE PURPOSE OF THIS INFORMATION HERE IS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION. TO LEARN ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FORMER EQUITY ACT OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATIONS AUTHORED BY OUR FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGUILAR CURRY IT WAS SIGNED BY THEN- OUR GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN YOU KNOW SO HERE TODAY WE LOOK TO EXPLORE THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE AS A STATE TO ADDRESS AND EQUITIES. FOR FARMERS OF COLOR. AND HOPE TO GET A SENSE OF THE WORK WE STILL NEED TO DO. THIS WORK WE HAVE AHEAD. TO SHORE FULL ACCESS TO STATE PROGRAMS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND LAND ACQUISITIONS FOR A LAND ACQUISITION FOR ALL OF OUR STATE'S FARMERS OR ASPIRING FARMERS. I HISTORICALLY MEMBERS OF SOCIALLY- AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES IN AGRICULTURE. INCLUDING BEING DENIED LAND OWNERSHIP IN THE EARLY NINETEENTH AND TWENTIETH CENTURIES. AND MORE RECENTLY EXPERIENCING SOME DELAYS- DISPROPORTIONAL- SOME DENIAL WITH GOVERNMENT LOANS. THE FARMER EQUITY ACT MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN CONFRONTING THIS PAST- SOME DISCRIMINATION SOME OF WHICH AND- STILL THE- TODAY. IT'S LEGISLATION CODIFIED THE DEFINITION OF SOCIALLY- A DISADVANTAGED GROUP AND SOCIALLY- A DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND ESTABLISH THE CDFA AS THE COORDINATING AGENCY FOR SOCIALLY- FOR THE SOCIALLY. DISADVANTAGED FORMER PROGRAMS NOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE MEANT TO BENEFIT FARMERS WHO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO PASS RACIAL OR ETHNIC PREJUDICE- FARMERS WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN- AMERICAN INDIAN I'M- ALASKAN NATIVE I THINK HISPANIC. ASIAN AMERICAN NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER. AND THEY BENEFIT OTHER UNDERSERVED GROUPS OF FARMERS AS WELL INCLUDING URBAN FARMERS VETERAN FARMERS WOMEN FARMERS AND LGBT Q. FARMERS. THE FARMER EQUITY ACT AIMS TO EMPOWER FARMERS BY ENSURING THAT C. D. F. A. INCLUDES SOCIALLY- SOCIALLY A DISSIDENT FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF ITS POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. IT ALSO THAT. TO COORDINATE EFFORTS AND SHARE INFORMATION REGARDING SOCIALLY- THE DISADVANTAGED FARMERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WE KNOW CALIFORNIA CULTURES THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE WORLD BOTH IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF THE COMMODITIES PRODUCED HERE IN OUR STATE. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF THE INCREDIBLY DIVERSE ARRAY OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS WORKING HARD TO BRING THOSE COMMODITIES TO MARKET. THE DIVERSITY- THE USE OF OUR STATE IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST TRAINS. AND IS SOMETHING I BELIEVE STRONGLY SHOULD BE CELEBRATED IN SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO KEEP CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE THRIVING WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE LONG TERM PROSPERITY OF ALL OUR CURRENT FARMERS AND RANCHERS. AND WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO ENCOURAGE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CALIFORNIA'S AND RANCHERS. AND WE MUST WORK TO REMOVE A LONG STANDING BARRIERS TO SERVICE THE RACIAL ETHNIC PREJUDICE- IT'S NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING FOR US TO DO- BUT IT WILL GO A LONG WAY TO CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION. TODAY WE'LL HEAR FROM BOTH FARMERS ADVOCATES AND ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN FARMING AND FORMER EQUITY ISSUES. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS DISCUSSION I DO KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T MENTION DUE TO A CONFLICT IN SCHEDULE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ID ARE. CURRY IS MAYBE WITH US NOW- BUT WILL BE WITH US VIRTUALLY. A SHE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE MENTION OF FARMER EQUITY ACT SO I INVITE HER IF SHE HAS ANY COMMENTS TO MAKE THEM NOW. AND ALSO JOINING US IN THIS ROOM IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGGIE JONES SAWYER.

A UP. FARMER FRANKLY. WE HAVE LANGUAGE BERRY WE STILL HAVE. ACCESS TO AVAILABLE. RESOURCES TO. SO LAW THESE THE NEXT YEARS I HOPE WE CONTINUE TO. SO THIS GROUP IN OUR TO JUST TO GET AT.

AND SO WE NEED TO. BE TO LET KNOW ABOUT THE TWO. INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN IT NOW BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FORGET. THAT AMERICA BASED ON AGRICULTURE. THE REASON WE ARE POWERHOUSES BECAUSE OF AGRICULTURE. UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF FREE LABOR. OR LABOR THAT. PEOPLE WEREN'T PAID WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID AND BECAUSE OF THAT IT IT. NOT ONLY SUPPORTED THAT ADD BUSINESS BUT MOST IMPORTANT- IT CREATE A WELL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. BUT NOT NECESSARILY DISADVANTAGED VOTE. AND SO I SOMEONE WHO JUST BEEN REAPPOINTED TO WE JUST BEEN APPOINTED TO THE NEW. REPARATIONS TASK FORCE- WE WANT TO LOOK AT ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW- I MAY NOT. GET MY FORTY ACRES AND A MULE- BUT IF I HAD TO CUT A DEAL YOU CAN KEEP THE MEAL BUT GIVEN MY FORTY ACRES- THE SO WE NEED TO HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT EQUITY.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AT THE HEARING ON THE BE ON THE COMMITTEE- I'M A DISTRICT THAT HAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURE SO I ALMOST KIND OF WONDER HOW I NEVER ENDED UP ON THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE BUT BETWEEN WINE GRAPES AND PEARS AND APPLES AND- GROUP YOU KNOW- DAIRY CATTLE- HUGE SUSTAINABLE AG FOOD NETWORK- THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT- AND THAT IS A LOT OF THIS IS FUELED BY- BY LABOR- THAT IS- STRUGGLES.

GOOD MORNING- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT- INTRODUCTION TODAY AND I REALLY APPRECIATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER I GOT CREEK COMMENT. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE AND- BACKGROUND A BIT ON THE FARM EQUITY REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN TWENTY TWENTY JUNE. AND THEN- A BIT MORE ABOUT. THE IMPLEMENTATION AND A REALLY TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT LIE AHEAD AND THAT EFFORT TO TFA HAVE BEEN MAKING- OVER THE PAST YEAR TO- ADDRESS A FARMER EQUITY. I'M IN A- SHARE SCREEN KNOWN. EVERYONE ABLE TO SEE THAT. NOT YET JUST A BLACK SCREEN. IT IS THAT WORKING OUT. NO IT'S STILL A BLACK SCREEN ON OUR END. THERE WE GO WE CAN. REMEMBER OKAY. REMOTELY WE THAT. OKAY REMOTE REMEMBER CONTENT BUT NOT IN THE- NO IT IS NOT LIVE NOW- WE CAN SEE HERE IN THE- THE CHAMBERS. OKAY WONDERFUL. THANK YOU FOR THAT GREAT INTER ON THE FARMER EQUITY ACT ITSELF AB THIRTEEN EIGHT PASSED IN TWO SEVENTEEN WITH THE SUPPORT OF MANY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT CALIFORNIA FORMER JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE THAT HAS WORKED ON TIRELESSLY BOTH TO IMPLEMENT THAT LEGISLATION AND THEN TO- CONTINUED. HAVE DISCUSSIONS AND- WORK WITH MYSELF AND CDFA TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPONENTS. OF THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. I'M GOING. TO THE- THIRD HERE WITH ASSEMBLY SICK OF FACT ABOUT WHAT THE MOST RECENT ADVANCES HAS SHOWN ABOUT SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN CALIFORNIA- NEARLY ONE IN FIVE. OR 19% APPROXIMATELY ARE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AN APARTMENT APPROXIMATELY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRES. AND ALSO ROUGHLY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND- FARMERS AND RANCHERS. INVESTORS THESE ARE THE MOST RECENT STATISTICS FROM THE AGCENTER WHICH ARE REALLY CONSIDERED MORE OF LIKE A BASELINE DATA INFORMATION BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T ACCURATELY CAPTURE URBAN FARMING- OR AGRICULTURE THAT PRACTICE THERE AND IT REALLY IS- A CUMBERSOME. THE SURVEY TO FILL OUT A SURVEY IS ALWAYS CONSIDERED TO BE A BASE DAY- FOR WHAT ACTUALLY MY BE IN THE STATE OF. BUT IT IS THE MOST REAL AND- SET OF DATA THAT EXISTS TWO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHICS- OF THAT. SOCIALLY THAT THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IN THE STATE AND THEN ALL NATION. OFFICIALLY DISOBEY FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE LOCATED IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA THE HIGHEST NUMBERS ARE FOUND IN THE SAN DIEGO FRESNO STANISLAUS TULARE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY- AND I COMMEND. THERE'S REAL STILL A NEED FOR MORE COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE DATA ON THAT THE GROUPS OF FARMERS PRACTICING. IN WITHIN URBAN AREAS. I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY TALK THIS MORNING ABOUT THE FARMER EQUITY REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED IN JUNE- AND GO OVER THE THEMES AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND REALLY WHAT IT'S BEING BUILT FROM THAT. REPORT THE REPORT WAS- YOU KNOW PART OF THE AB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT LEGISLATION AND WHEN I STARTED WORKING AT CDFA IN THE FALL OF TWO TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I PRETTY MUCH SPENT MOST OF TWENTY NINETEEN A DEVELOPING AND RESEARCHING FOR THIS REPORT. THIS IS ALL PRE CODED ON SO I WAS THANKFULLY ABLE TO GO AND VISIT FARMERS AND RANCHERS. I'M ACROSS THE STATE. AND MY GOAL REALLY I WAS. ENSURE THAT THE VOICE OF THESE FARMERS AND RANCHERS DURING IN TRIP. AND THAT THEIR STORIES WERE HIGHLY. AS THE WAY TO SHOW THEIR IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION ALSO TO REALLY UNDERLYING THERE'S- CONTINUED. AND THEIR CONTINUED- STRUGGLE TO ACTUALLY RUN THEIR BUSINESSES. I'M AND HOW HIS- INEQUITIES AND ANY COURT ACTIONS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MAKING THEIR- BUSINESSES- DIFFICULT TO RUN AND BE SUCCESSFUL IN SOME CASES. AND SO YOU'LL SEE PICTURES OF THESE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE ROUTE WITHIN THE REPORT IS ALSO VERY THEIR ACTUAL STORIES AND THEY'RE LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS- THAT THEY REPRESENT WHERE THEIR FARMING AND- I INTERVIEWED THIRTY THREE FARMERS. AND FOR THIS REPORT AND THEY WERE FARMERS FROM. BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS THE REPRESENTED CROPS FROM ANYWHERE- STONE FRUIT NOT. I CANNABIS GROWERS L. CUT FLOWERS NOT TRUE DROP. MANY PERSONALIZED AGRICOLE OPERATION- AND IN FROM A OR AN EIGHT EVEN IN EIGHT SEVEN ONE OPERATE UP TO THREE HUNDRED ACRES TO TRY TO CAPTURE THE REAL DIVERSITY IN THE ACTUAL TYPES OF AGRICULTURE BEING PRACTICED HERE- BY THESE GROUPS OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS. THE FIRST- THE FIRST CHANNEL THAT WAS. REALLY BROUGHT ABOUT IT BY THE REPORT AND CONTINUE TO BE SOMETHING OF GREAT AND- IS LESS TENURE AND WE IT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED IN THE IN BUT MANY SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS DO NOT HAVE STABLE LONG TERM ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE LAND THAT THEY FARM AND THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO. UNDERSTAND AND- DOES THE STRUGGLES THAT MANY FARMERS AND RANCHERS HAVE IN THE STATE ACTUALLY- TO HAVE A LONG TERM LEASE. ON TEN OF THE FIFTEEN APARTMENTS ABOUT EIGHT OR HAD TO MOVE THEIR OPERATIONAL LEAST ONE. IT WOULD TO EITHER A RENT INCREASE A LEASE TERMINATION OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE DOCTOR LACK OF WATER- FIRE FLOOD OR DROUGHT. OPERATE UNDER THE SAME LEASE EVEN AFTER THE TWENTY NINETEEN GROWING SEASON- IN MANY OTHERS- WE'RE UNSURE IF THEY WOULD CONTINUE- EVEN BEING ABLE TO OPERATE THEY'RE BOTH CROPS THAT THEY OFFERED NOW IF THEY HAVE ANY IMPLICATIONS FOR THINGS LIKE IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSERVATION PROGRAMS- AND THERE'S SO MANY MORE EXAMPLES. WHERE LAND TENURE- IS A BARRIER FOR AT APPLICATION FOR GRANT PROGRAMS AND OTHER THINGS THAT- THAT CDFA NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AND AS A FAMILY MEMBER YOUR CREE NOTED- AT LEAST TENURE TO BE SOME THAT- IS WORKING ON- IN THE REPORT I TALKED ABOUT. IN INTERAGENCY. TO REALLY START TO- DEVELOP PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT SUPPORT DISADVANTAGED FARMERS TO PUT EITHER PURCHASE PLANS HAVE ACCESS TO FARMLAND ENSURE STABLE LAND LEASES AND ALL TO IMPLEMENT CONSERVATION PRACTICES. THOSE THREE THINGS. THE FAA YEAH IN THE PARA BEEN- WE TO ENSURE THE GRANT THAT WE DO FOR. AND RANCHERS ARE WORKING TO MODIFY PROGRAMS TO IT- MAKE SURE THAT LAND CAN YOU IS NOT A BIG AT YOUR PARKED AT THE- WE'VE ALSO BEEN- CALL. CLOSELY THE DEATH OF CUTS. I'M OUT THERE WITH THEIR WORK. AT PRESS PRO PRIORITIES FOR THE FIFTEEN ADLAI CON PROGRAM. BUT THERE'S NEEDS TO- HAVE MORE HUNGER. WITH OTHER AGENCY AND OTHER- ELECTED IF ABOUT- DID TO LAND AT AND IT IS THE- KNOWN FACT THAT FARMERS ARE THE COUNTRY. ARE GETTING OLDER AND- RICH HI AND THERE- HELLO OF OPPORTUNITY BACK BE REALIZED ON TO RECALL. AND SO THE SYSTEM THAT- CONTINUE TO BE IN A IS AND- IN TWENTY TWO ONE HOPE TO MORE. MOVEMENT ON. IT IS. ONE SEEM- THE SECOND CHALLENGE LINK THOUGH ON MY SEEM YOU KNOW EVERYONE ON THAT THERE'S NO LANGUAGE SPOKEN HERE AND CAL BUT IN ACTION. IT IS THE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT FORMER FINANCE DO NOT ALWAYS SPEAK ENGLISH IS THE FOR LANGUAGE AND THAT THEY PROHIBITIVE WHEN YOU UNDER IN ABOUT THEIR ABOUT RAY. ABOUT KROGER ABOUT. MARKETING PRODUCTS HAVE MANAGE BUSINESS MANAGER. AND ALSO COME THROUGH THERE LAW OF CALM WITH THINK IN- MEETING- IN AND POP SPACE. WINDOWS MEANING ARE A ENGLISH READ THAN ALLOWING THAT. FILM COMFORTABLE COME AND- TWENTY SEVEN THE THIRTY FARM THAT THAT I INTERVIEWED SPEAK ENGLISH AS THEIR FOR LANGUAGE. AND TWENTY SIX OF THE TWO SEVEN. GENERATE AND WITH- NO FOR LANGUAGE AFRICAN. IN THE- AGAIN THE WAS WRITTEN WITH CO GOOD NIGHT AT BEFORE WE- MOVING TO. A LOT MORE FOR. PUBLIC MEETINGS AND INNER- BUT- WITHIN THE WITHIN TWO- WE HAVE DONE MADE SIMPLE ON OFFERING- AGENCY WHY OPPORTUNITIES INTERPRETATION WE'RE DOING A PILOT PROJECT WITH OUR STATE BOARD TO OFFER- SIMULTANEOUS INTERPRETATION INTO SPANISH- THERE ARE LOTS OF CONVERSATIONS THE MOVING PIECES ABOUT OFFER YOU KNOW OPPORTUNITIES TO INCORPORATE TRANSLATION INTO VIRTUAL MEETING SPACES- CERTAINLY WITHIN PDF. OFFERING CHU OPPORTUNITIES AND- I RESOURCES FOR DOES EMPLOYEES WHO ARE INTERACTING DIRECTLY WITH FARMERS AND RANCHERS AS WELL- BUT THERE'S STILL A NEED TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION AND SERVICES IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH- STARTING WITH OUR- YOU KNOW OUR WEBSITE OUR PRESS RELEASES ARE NARAL TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH. AND WE'RE WORKING ON OFFERING OTHER- OTHER PUBLIC INFORMATION IT AND BANISHES WELL AND THEN REALLY- DID. A LANGUAGE OUT REACHED WITH SOMETHING THAT CAME ABOUT A LOT DURING KOBE NINETEEN WHEN MANY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED IT THE MOST REGARDING TESTING- AND NOT VACCINES AND YOU KNOW DEVELOPING. RELATE WITH. JIMMY OR THAT OTHERS- AND- REQUIRING. SKILLS NEW EMPLOYEES THAT ARE WORKING ON THE GROUND- WITH THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY I'M GOING FORWARD. THE THIRD THING THAT I'D LIKE TO MENTION IS ENGAGEMENT WITH AG INDUSTRY AND BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND THAT'S REALLY GET TO- A BIG PIECE OF EQUITY AND THAT IS ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND THE LAST TWO CHALLENGES HERE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT A REALLY ABOUT ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND USED. TO STRUCTURE- THAT EXIST STILL THAT YOU'RE NOT THIRD ALL OF THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS THAT WERE THAT WERE AT TRYING TO REACH SERVE AS AN AGING. SO IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT MANY SOCIAL FARMERS ARE RANCHERS DO NOT BELONG TO IN THIS ORGANIZATION- AND THEY DO NOT- THAT DOES THEY DON'T ABOUT PROGRAM THEY HEAR ABOUT IN PART AND READ AND OTHER ON. EIGHTY FIVE OF THOSE I INTERVIEWED SAID THEY DID NOT ATTEND MEETINGS BECAUSE THEY DID IT THE MEETINGS ACTUALLY APPLIED TO THEM. IT PERCENT SAID DID NOT RAISE HE ABOUT OR THEY WERE AT HIGH WHEN THEY WERE WORKING ON THE FARM. FIFTY FIVE PER SAY THAT THEY DID NOT JOINING. OR CLUB GROUP THEY DID. HAVE ENJOYING THE GROUP. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THE- PLAYS A PART IN THE ACTION BOY. OF THE HISTORICALLY UNDER GROUP. NUMBER ONE THERE'S NOT AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PRESENT AT THE MEETING OR THE INFORMATION OR THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE INTERNET SITE THAT HAS THE INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC MEETINGS- AND THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THAT IT APPLIES TO HIM THEY'RE BUSY THEY'RE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE TIME TO ATTEND- NEEDING ABOUT REGULATIONS THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR FORM OR JOIN A BOARD OR COMMISSION THAT- CREATE POLICIES THAT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR FARM AND SO THIS IS A BIG- IMPORTANT PIECE OF THE FARMER EQUITY ACT. AND IT. GOES TO REALLY LOOK AT SHIFTING THE WAY THAT OUR AGENT. DOES BUSINESS AND DOES OUTREACH- TO SERVE- AND GET THE PROBE FROM. TO THE GROUP'S THAT HAVE BEEN THE MOST IMPACTED HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY- AND THAT WHO NEED THIS INFORMATION THE MOST. THE ONES WHO REALLY DO NEED THE GRANT PROGRAMS OR NEED THOSE CONSERVATION. ON THEIR FARMS AND REALLY- ARE BEING SERVED BY- BY THE PROGRAM- IF YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR NEXT- FROM BROUGH AND MY WHO ARE COOPER EXT GA SPECIALIST AND- I JUST. IN THE REPORT I CAN'T ENOUGH ABOUT THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW AND I'LL LET THEM SPEAK ABOUT WHAT. YOU'RE DOING WITH- UNDERSERVED FARMERS. BUT THE REAL NEED HERE IS TO SUPPORT EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS. WITH SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE OUT OF REACH CAN'T REALLY BE DONE FROM SACRAMENTO AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE STAFF STATEWIDE WE'RE WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON SUPPORTING THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE- TO HAVE THOSE TRED TO RELEASE- WHO WHO ARE ABLE. TO HELP THOSE- AND- THAT REALLY FOCUSING ON OUR REGION. CREATED WITH AND BY FARMERS OF COLOR AND PEOPLE OF COLOR LED ORGANIZATION FROM THE BEGINNING AND NOT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT- IS ALSO IMPORTANT POINT OF THIS. ONE THING THAT HAS COME OUT OF THIS RECOMMENDATION IS- TO BCPS- EIGHT AM ONE BCK WITH PROBE IN- THAT HOPE TO ALL OF YOU HAVE SEEN- BUT INTO IT IS- AT THE- FOR SMALL FARMS- THE SMALL BAR PROGRAM THAT YOU SEE COOPER EXTENSION BUT ALL. THE I T. A. ORGANISING. THAT ARE HAVE BEEN A DO THINK IN THROUGHOUT TWENTY TO HELP THEM APPLY. AFTER RELEASED FUND AND THAT WHO REALLY NEED ADDITION SUPPORT TO ACT HELP THOSE FARMER DIRECTLY. AND THEN THE LAST PIECE HERE IS TO RE. AND PROGRAM AND MANY RICH LATEST EVENT THEIR INSURANCE NOT ONLY FOR MIL. I'M WITH THE RESORT TECH ASSIST AND OTHER INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IT EXISTS OR THEY DON'T THE TIME WILL RETURN TO APPLY IT WILL BE DONE NOW THIS IS ALSO A GOOD- RELATED TO FUNDING OR SOME. TA ORGANISER TO HELP- DOES HELP BOTH THREE DIRECTLY. I WE A COUPLE EXAM OF HOW THAT BEEN IMPLEMENTED IT CDFA. WITH BOTH OUR CLIMATE SMART AND KEY TO ARE ON THE GROUND IN ABLE TO HELP. OUR FARMERS AND APPLY FOR OUR- CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE. WE ALSO HAVE. A PROTEGER FRESH THAT ARE ALL DOING VERY SIMILAR. AFTER TWO TO ENGAGE WITH FARMERS- AND FROM EDUCATIONAL READ THAT FOR.

RELATED TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AND. DO YOU THINK THAT THAT CONCLUSION. WORKING FOR AND REAL FOCUS ON TWENTY THIRTY ONE AS THE NUMBER. THAT WOULD MAYBE DIDN'T THEY OF REALLY GETTING IT THE CAR WITH THE ACT AND HAPPY. AND PRIORITIZING- THESE FARMERS AND RANCHERS WHO NEED TO BOTH GUIDE AND SHAPE AND LEAD THE PROGRAM I'M SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY WILL WORK FOR THOSE GROUPS- SO I'D FORMED AD HOC ADVISORY COMMITTEE ONE COMPRISED- OF BY PARK FARMERS AND RANCHERS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE I WE HAD OUR FIRST MEETING THIS WEEK AND- HOW TO A SMALL FARMS SUPPORT ORGANIZATION GROUP AGAIN ORGANIZATIONS ARE DIRECTLY SUPPORTING SUPPORTING SMALL FARMS TO HELP THEM WITH ECONOMIC RELIEF- EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY INTERNALLY- OUR OUR AGENCY IS A PART OF THE CAPITAL COLLABORATIVE ON RACE AND EQUITY WHICH IS A GROUP OF. FIFTEEN DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES PARTICIPATING IN A RACIAL EQUITY TRAINING YEAR LONG TRAINING- AT THE END ABOUT WILL HAVE A RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLAN FOR AGENCY. SEVERAL OTHER AGENCIES HAVE ALSO HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS COHORT AND ALREADY HAVE PUBLIC RACIAL EQUITY ACTION PLAN ON SUCH AS THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL- AND OTHERS. AND YOU CAN REALLY START TO SEE THE MOMENTUM THAT'S BUILDING AMONG OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO ADDRESS- OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES INTERNALLY- WITHIN OUR STAFF AS WELL AS OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS THE FARMERS AND RANCHERS TO CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE'LL ALSO BE DOING WE HAVE A RACIAL EQUITY SPEAKER SERIES ALSO INTERNALLY FOR ALL OF OUR STAFF AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. ON SUCH AS THE P. E. I. COMMITTEE TO ENGAGE- ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. AS WELL IN THIS EFFORT- RELATED TO IT. RELATED TO INCLUDE THE INCREASING ACCESS TO OUR GRANT PROGRAM- AS A PRIORITY FOR THE SPECIALTY CROP BLOCK GRANT I'M REALLY THROUGHOUT TWENTY NINETEEN NOTING THAT THERE'S STILL A NEED TO RESHAPE THE PRIORITY FOR FIRST TIME APPLICANTS FOR REALLY UNDER THIRD AND THAT MORE ORGANIZATIONS WHO DON'T HAVE PAID GREAT WRITERS TO ACTUALLY ACT WITH AND GET ONE ON ONE ASSISTANCE LONGER TERM ASSISTANCE ON TO HELP MAKE THESE GRANTS MORE EQUITABLE- AND ACCESSIBLE WE'VE HIRED A FARM EQUITY AND OUT ANALYST WHO WILL BE IN THE GRANT OFFICE AND SHE IS. THE TYPICALLY- TASKED WITH WORKING WITH ME AND WITHIN THE GRANT OFFICE TO HELP- PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUPPORT FOR THOSE.

ON GOING COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA BAR REJECTED COLLABORATIVE WHO ARE MADE UP OF. MANY INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS THAT HAVE MANY OTHER ROLES THAT THEY PLAY- SERVING HAVE FARMERS- THE SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND HAVING ONGOING MEETINGS WITH THEM- GETTING THEIR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT IT IN QUITE AS- REALLY- I'M IMPORTANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN- AND THEN FINALLY- THERE ARE NEW WEBSITE RESOURCES ON OUR ON OUR- UNDERSTOOD IF THEY WANTED ALL SHARE HERE. THE FIRST WE I CREATED BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN IT IS AN INDEX SORRY THIS IS ALL RELATED AGAIN TO ACCESS TO INFORMATION. BUT ALSO FARMER CENTRIC INFORMATION INFORMATION THAT IS THE RELATIVE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND HOPEFULLY SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS- SO THAT THEY CAN AVE BETTER ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND RESOURCES- WE HAVE A TWITTER ACCOUNT NOW IN SPANISH- WE AGAIN LIKE I SAID WE'RE OFFERING OUR- PRESS RELEASES IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH AS WELL. OF THE PHARMACY THE COURTS PORTAL AT THE TOP HERE IS. JUST A REORGANIZATION OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT OUR WEBSITE THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELATIVE TO FARMERS THE NEW PRIMARILY INCLUDE GRANT PROGRAMS BUT ALSO INFORMATION ABOUT THE REGULATIONS AND OTHER- IMPORTANT THINGS THAT CONGRESS MIGHT NEED TO KNOW. AND THEN FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WE JUST MADE PUBLIC. IS AN INDEX OF ALL OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. ANOTHER PIECE OF THE FARMER EQUITY REPORT THAT IT DIDN'T GO INTO A LOT THIS MORNING BUT IS A VERY IMPORTANT. COMPONENT OF ACCESS IS THAT MANY OF OUR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS. I DON'T HAVE- REPRESENTATIVES OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. AND THIS. NOT ONLY THAT THAT ARE ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND TASK FORCES. HAVE SEPARATE PIECES OF INFORMATION BUT IT WASN'T ALL. AND CONSISTENT AND IT WAS AN ALL IN ONE PLACE SO THAT THEY ACTUALLY PUT ALL THE INFORMATION ONE PLACE. SHARE THE COST ALL GROUPS. A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC CAN EASILY GO AND FIND INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO JOIN- YOU THESE BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WHAT ARE YOU WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS EXTRATERRESTRIAL THAT'S AN ON GOING PROJECT- AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THAT- SO. ALL THE THINGS. THAT REALLY YOU KNOW RELATED TO THE FAR. REPORT WHAT WE'RE REALLY JUST GETTING STARTED THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE YOU CAN WILL CONTINUE TO DO. WITH THE SUPPORT OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN PARTICULARLY- THE- ENGAGEMENT AND- INCLUSION OF. AS MANY OF THE FARMERS OF COLORED. THEY HAVE BEEN THE MOST AFFECTED BOTH BY CULVERTED AND BY BY ALL OF THESE OTHER HISTORIC AND INSTITUTIONAL- INEQUITIES. AND REALLY LET THEM GUIDE AND SHAPE THESE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES GOING FORWARD. IT'S GREAT- MISPRINT HOUSE REALLY APPRECIATE- ALL THE INFORMATION OKAY HOLD ON AS WE MAY HAVE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL- OUR NEXT PANELIST IS RUTH- DAHLQUIST WILLARD- IS HE SHE'S A- SMALL FARMS AND- CROPS ADVISOR FOR UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION IN FRESNO AND- TULARE COUNTIES. WHERE SHE SERVES A DIVERSE CLIENTELE INCLUDING SMALL SCALE FAMILY FARMS BEGINNING FARMERS IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE FARMERS INCLUDING AMONG IN OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN FARMERS. SHE ALSO ASSIST FARMERS WITH A WHAT WIDE ARRAY OF SPECIALTY CROPS THAT I CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW WERE GROWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INCLUDING ASIAN VEGETABLES HERBS. TO JU JU BEES MORINGA BLUEBERRIES STRAWBERRIES BLACKBERRIES AND I HAD THE PLEASURE OF VISITING A LONG FORM- IN THE COUNTY FRESNO. WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOAQUIN ARAMBULA IT'S A GREAT EXPERIENCE INCESSANTLY FOX SAW SAW FIRST HAND- THE EXAMPLE OF- OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THE- THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S PROVIDED TO THESE- THESE DISADVANTAGED FARMERS BUT ALSO THE DIVERSITY OF THE CROPS THAT WERE GROWN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO WITH THAT- RUTH WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US IT'S ALL YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IT WRITING AND MICHAEL TO SPEAK TODAY AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR COMING TO FRESNO FOR ABOUT IS IT- THANKS AGAIN FOR GIVING OUT OVER VIEW OF THE FORMER EQUITY- ACTS AND THE EFFORTS THAT CDFA IS WORKING ON- AND- GIVES A SORT OF A- AN OVERVIEW OF THE WORK THAT. WE HANG AND I ARE DOING- AND HOPEFULLY WITH. THE IDEA THAT- WE CAN SPARK IDEAS OF HOW TO CONNECTS TO OUR WORK AND TO NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND AGENCIES TO. REALLY INCREASE EQUITY FOR THE FARMERS THAT WE SERVE- SO I'M ONE OF FOUR SMALL PROVIDERS IF YOU SEE AN ART THAT ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND OUR EXTENSION PROGRAMS ACTUALLY BEEN FOCUS ON EQUITY FROM THE BEGINNING SINCE THE ORIGINAL SMALL FAR PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE AFTER SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT EQUITY- AND THE FIRST YEAR WAS ALL FORMS OF VISORS THAT WERE HEARD WORLD BILINGUAL IN SPANISH AND SMOKERS ON- ON SPANISH SPEAKING FARMERS AND SO. ALTHOUGH WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT STATEWIDE PROGRAM ANYMORE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN THE COUNTIES THAT WE WORK AND- OBVIOUSLY AND PARTICULARLY WITH A FOCUS ON SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS SO. I LIKE TO QUICKLY MENTION MYSELF FROM COLLEAGUES- APARNA CONSUMER WHO SUPPORTS- CHINESE IMMIGRANT FARMERS IN THE CENTER AREA. AND THEN MARGARET LLOYD IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA HE'S EXPERT AND STANDING THE OUTRAGE OF HER PROGRAMS IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN FARMERS AND WE HAVE. A LOCAL IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- WHO HAS WORKED WITH YOU KNOW FARMERS AND DEVELOPING EXTENSION MATERIALS IN SPANISH- AND I'M LOCATED- IN FRESNO SORRY COUNTIES AND SALAS DOLLY WHICH IS ALSO WHERE I GREW UP- I ACTUALLY HAD THE HONOR TO RACINE TO SMALL FIRMS ADVISORS WHO RETIRED AROUND TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND THAT WHAT WAS RICHARD MOLINAR IN FRESNO COUNTY AND MANY OF NECESSARY COUNTY WHO'S ONE OF THE ORIGINAL- ADVISORS HIRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. NINE BOTH OF THEM HAD THESE INCREDIBLE LIKE LEGACIES WITH DECADES OF WORK- SUPPORTING SMALL SCALE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE FARMERS. AND THEN I ALSO HAVE THE HONOR OF WORKING WITH MICHAEL YANKEL YOU'LL HEAR FROM NEXT- WHO HAS BEEN SUPPORTING SOUTHEAST ASIAN FARMING COMMUNITY FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS NOW INCLUDING- FONG AND- LOUD TIE. CAMBODIAN AND VIETNAMESE FARMERS- SO ARE SERVES OF LARGE OF FOR OF COLOR OR IN OUR- IN THE WAY U. S. SENSE RECORDS THERE WERE ABOUT THIRTY FIVE AND SMALL AND SOCIALLY FARMERS- THAT'S DEFINED AS UNDER OF DOLLARS I'M SORRY HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY ARE BASED THE CENSUS DATA IN THOSE TWO COUNTIES COMBINED AS THE INVENTION THAT NUMBER IS VERY LIKELY UNDER REPORTED- SO THAT'S A BASS LINE AND AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED SMALL SCALE SYSTEMS FARMERS AND BUT YOU COUNTY- AND ALSO AS YOU MENTIONED LANGUAGE OFTEN A BARRIER. TO ACCESS RESOURCES. MOST OF OUR TRAINS ARE BILINGUAL. IN EITHER MOM OR SPANISH AND THEN WE ALSO OFFER INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT FOR EXTENSION IN WELLINGTON JABI. AND MICHAEL HAS FOR MANY YEARS HOSTED A WEEKLY RADIO SHOW IN MONICA. **** THAT COMMUNITY ACTUALLY FROM BAKER SEALED UP TO MODESTO AND IS NOTBEING- EXPENSES OF THE TO THE SACRAMENTO AREA WITH MARKET WAGE WORK- SO IN IN MY TO COUNTIES WE LOG OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED. INDIVIDUAL FORMER CONTACTS YEAR YOUR WORKSHOPS AND THEN OUR ONE ON ONE SUPPORT- SUCH AS VISITING FARMS AND ABOUT 85% OF THOSE CONTACT SERVICE MEMBERS OF COLOR. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT PROBABLY HALF OF THOSE CONTACTS ARE FARMERS THAT CALL MICHAEL YOUNG FOR ASSISTANCE SO YOU'LL HEAR MORE. ABOUT THAT NEXT FOR MICHAEL- SO WHEN I THE WAYS THAT WE- SCALE FARMERS OF COLOR IS THROUGH ASSISTANCE AND PRODUCTION AND MARKETING FOR. THE SMALLER ACREAGE CROPS THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIVAS MENTIONED THAT AREN'T I'M NOT SUPPORTED BY COUNTY BOARDS- SO WE PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF SUPPORT- FOR EXAMPLE IN FRESNO COUNTY WE HAVE A VERY LARGE RADIUS OF THE ASIAN SPECIALTY VEGETABLES. IS ACTUALLY INDUSTRY WITH ANNUAL SALES OF ABOUT. SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO ALTHOUGH IT'S SMALL FARMS IT ADDS UP TO. A SUBSTANTIAL- INDUSTRY AND ITS OWN. AND SO WE PROVIDE SUPPORT WITH PRODUCTION ISSUES LIKE PEST MANAGEMENT NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT YOUR KITCHEN AS WELL AS DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THOSE CROPS- FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW- ACCORDING. TO WHAT I ARE DOING RESEARCH ON. TAKE IN CROPS LIKE LEMON GRASS SOCK CHOICE- WHICH CHIMES MORINGA AND CHRYSANTHEMUM LEAVES. BECAUSE THIS INFORMATION ACTUALLY EXIST FOR THESE CROPS ALTHOUGH IT'S NEEDED THOSE FOR FERTILIZER RECOGNITIONS AND ALSO FOR OUR- REQUIRE NITROGEN REPORTING FOR THE IRRIGATED LANDS REGULATORY PROGRAM. AND SPEAKING OF THAT PROGRAM I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE MAJOR THEMES OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND- PROBABLY ALMOST ALL REGULATORY PROGRAMS ARE JUST NOT REALLY DESIGNED TO BE A GOOD FIT. FOR FARMS THAT ARE SMALLER SCALE AND HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED WITH ROTATIONS OF MANY DIFFERENT CROPS- AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR FARMERS WHO WERE CRIPPLING. BILINGUAL SUPPORT. I'M SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE WERE ON A LOT IS HELPING FARMERS MEANING COMPLIANCE WITH LOW BRING. PROGRAMS AND I REALLY TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF MICHAEL'S WORK AND HIS LONG TERM TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE SOUTHEAST ASIA FROM COMMUNITY. BASICALLY ANYTIME AND FARMERS TO GET PAPERWORK IN THE MAIL THAT. IS A REGULATORY PROGRAM AFTER TO DO IT. THEY BRING TO MICHAEL AND HE HELPS THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESOLVE IT AND NOT GET COULD BE FOOD SAFETY THAT YOUR DATA PLANS. TO REPORTING. LABOR REQUIREMENTS PERMITS AND REPORTING FOR PESTICIDE USE AND NOW- SO. THIS IS DANA GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT STARTING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. YOU'RE GOING TO PRESENT MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR SMALL SCALE AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE IS PROGRAMS WE ALSO ARE INVOLVED IN COMMUNICATING WITH POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THOSE CHALLENGES. AND HOPEFULLY FINDING WAYS TO IMPROVE THEM SO THEY'RE NOT JUST ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND THEY CAN BE ADAPTED TO. THE REALITY OTHER FARMS- A FEW YEARS AGO WE WERE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SUGGEST SOME CHANGES TO THE IRRIGATED LANDS PROGRAM THAT WERE ADOPTED- TO ALLOW ALTERNATE NIGER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL AND DIVERSIFIED FARMS. AND THEN AND WE DO WORK CLOSELY WITH CFA AS WELL WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR SOME OF THE CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE PROGRAMS LIKE SWEET AND HEALTHY SOILS. AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPING PROGRAMS OR FOOD SAFETY INSPECTIONS AND WAS VERY THANKFUL TO HAVE OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH THE- AND WITH. CITY BASED PROGRAMS I. REGARDING EQUITY IN ACCESS ISSUES- ONE OTHER THING I REALLY LIKE TO. ABOUT ARMS OUR SMALL FARMS. IS THAT. WHERE WE'RE LOCATED WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES FOR ACROSS AN ARC. AND EVEN THE WIDER UC SYSTEM TO BENEFIT FARMERS THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE RESOURCES SO WE KIND OF SERVE AS A RESOURCE HUB. IN OUR REGIONS AND WE BRING IN OTHER IN OUR CAR OFFICERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN A PARTICULAR PROPERTY OR DISCIPLINE LIKE COST MANAGEMENT OR SOCIAL. SCIENCE SO THAT THEIR EXPERTISE CAN ALSO BE SENT TO PURSUE BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED URBAN MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT RESOURCE AND- SO MANY PEOPLE ABOUT. MY PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE A COMPOST SPREADER THAT WE- MAKE AVAILABLE TO FARMERS TO. IMPLEMENT. THOSE PROJECTS. YEAH BECAUSE OF OUR USED RESEARCH AS WE TO STORE IN THE CURRENT. WERE THERE TECHNICAL STAFF THAT MAINTENANCE. AND THEN WE COLLABORATE WITH BRENT HOLDS HIS APOLOGY FROM ADVISOR- IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY- BRAND HAS BEEN A LEADER IN RESEARCH ON WHOLE ORCHARD RECYCLING AND ALMONDS AND HE'S ALSO ON. THE SIDE AND EXPERT ON COMPOST SPREADERS SO- YOU KNOW HIS RESEARCH IS NOT ONLY HELPING TO ON FIELD TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY IN OUR REGION BUT WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO TAP INTO HIS EXPERTISE. TELL SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM IN AND GET THE CONCEPTS BY. TO THEIR FARMS- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LEVERAGING RESOURCE DURING AN OPEN- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK IN THE UC DAVIS WESTERN'S EVER AGRICULTURAL HUB AND SAFETY AND THEN ALSO THE UCSF- COMMITTEE CODE NINETEEN EVERY PROJECT. THAT SPACE IN FRESNO- THREE CSS MEDICAL PROGRAMS AND THEN ALSO ARE. INTERESTED COMMUNITY BASED NONPROFIT PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS- TO HELP WITH THE ROLL OUT OF BOXING TO SOCIALLY JUST. VANISHED FARMERS. AS PART OF THE OF THE STUDENT ACT YOUR- BUT SO. ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS FOR SMALL SCALE IS A DISADVANTAGE FARMERS TO ACCESS THE VACCINE HAS BEEN THAT VACCINATION SITES. USUALLY ASK FOR DOCUMENTATION LIKE A PASTE UP. TO SHOW THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN AGRICULTURE. BUT IT. SMALL SCALE FARMER THERE'S NO STANDARD DOCUMENTATION LIKE A CASE TIME TO PROVE THAT AND EVEN IF YOU SHOWED A PERMIT OR A LICENSE THE STAFF AT THAT CLINIC MIGHT NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING YES UP TO DEVELOP A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS FARMERS THAT WE KNOW HOW TO GET ON A LIST AND THEN WE PROVIDE TO THE- CODE NINETEEN EQUITY PROJECT AND THEY CAN GET VACCINATED WITH JUST A PHOTO ID. IS THERE ALREADY ON THE LIST SO WE HAD OUT HERE TWENTY FARMERS OR THAT SO FAR I MEAN% THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW WE TRY TO FILL IN THE GAPS IN OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT- SMALL SCALE AND SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS CAN GET THE RESOURCES THAT OTHERWISE. MIGHT NOT MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS- BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN THAT AREA AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH- AGENCIES. AND- MARKETING PARTNER. NOW THE LARGEST. TO YOU KNOW TO INCREASE EQUITY INCREASE ACCESS TO RESOURCES HOW ARE WE CANNOT. SO I'M GONNA. STOP HERE AND TURN IT OVER TO YOU MICHAEL YET. ALSO HAS- GONNA TALK MORE ABOUT OUR WORK WITH SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE FARMERS. THAT'S GREAT IF I GET IN TROUBLE QUICKLY TO FORMALLY INTRODUCE MICHAEL REALLY APPRECIATE INFORMATION RUTH AND MICHAEL IS EIGHT MONTH AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANT FOR THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SMALL FARM PROGRAM IN FRESNO COUNTY HE'S SUPPORTED- THOSE COMMUNITIES OF IMMIGRANTS REFUGEES AND UNDERSERVED.

THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND THANKS FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ANNA QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER SO OFTEN. SO WE OF THE RECOMMENDED. IN THE- TWO FOR- SPECIFICALLY TO LEGISLATURE'S. THAT TO HIGHLIGHTED. OF CALIFORNIA FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND OUT REACH MEDIAPOST HOWEVER. STILL WHITE. WHAT MEASURES ARE CDFA TAKING TO IMPLEMENT A PIPELINE SPECIFICALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS IN URBAN AREAS LIKE MINE- SO JUST SOUTH LA TO BECOME FARMERS AND WHAT MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THEIR SUCCESS WHICH IS PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE'RE DOING- THAT IS IMPLEMENTED AND HAS SUCCESSFUL. AND THAT WE DO ON CURRENT ONGOING ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THAT SYSTEM. NOT SURE IF- SOME ON THE PANEL WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION. I'D BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I THINK THAT URBAN FARMERS AS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH BOTH THE U. S. THE ADVENTURES AND THEN ALSO WITHIN CITY UPDATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN URBAN AG FOCUS AND- SOME SOME NEW- I'D MENTIONED DURING MY REPORT R. DURING MY- PRESENTATION ABOUT. FORMING AND- ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND- WE HAVE MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO INCLUDE- MEMBERS URBAN AG- MEMBERS ON THAT COMMITTEE AND- I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM DAM ABOUT HOW WE CAN START TO CREATE. THOSE PROGRAMS AND OPPORTUNITIES- I THINK A LOT CAN DO IN THAT IN THIS AREA AND I THINK THAT- THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WILL COME WITH IN THIS YEAR FROM ACTUALLY LISTENING AND LETTING THOSE URBAN FARMERS GUIDE- THOSE PRIORITIES AND- REALLY TRY TO CREATE SOME. PROGRAMS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK FOR THEM. AND THEN IT WIL START TO CREATE THAT TO WORK FOR THEM. WHAT I. THERE ARE. GOING TO TAKE. SHE KNOW I WOULD SAY ONE PROGRAM THAT DOES THAT DOES HAVE- AND- POTENTIAL INFLUENCE AND IMPORTANCE WITH URBAN AG IS OUR FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND THIS IS A NEW GRANT PROGRAM THAT WAS JUST- ACTUALLY THE R. F. P. WAS JUST RECENTLY RELEASED- AND SO THERE IS THAT PROGRAM BUT- THERE ARE MORE OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THAT NEED TO BE REALIZED WITH REGARDS TO URBAN FARMERS. GOOD BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE SWATHS OF LAND. WHERE IN SOUTH LA WHERE WE HAVE A- OPTION ABANDONED INDUSTRY AND WAREHOUSES- ARE JUST VACANT LOTS EVERYWHERE ALL OVER SOUTH LA. THAT WOULD BE AMENABLE TO SOME KIND OF URBAN FARMING ENDED BUT WE'VE NEVER REALLY DEVELOPED AND- A ROBUST PLANNED- TO ADDRESS IT- AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE. THAT BELIEVES THAT. ONE DAY ONCE. CANNABIS IS- LEGALIZED FEDERALLY- WE DON'T NEED AS MUCH LAND TO MAKE A GOOD PROFIT AND THE AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY START TO EMBRACE IT AND MAYBE EVEN TAKE PARTS OF THEIR LAND TO HELP WITH THE BOTTOM LINE- TWO BROKE CANNABIS THAT MIGHT BE AN EXCELLENT START IN ENDS IN SOUTH LA AND OTHER PLACES AND SO THAT WE CAN BUILD AN ECONOMY THAT IS IN INDUSTRY AND SO- RIGHT NOW THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IS BECOMING PART OF THE LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OTHER CHAMBERS SO THEY'RE- THEY'RE BECOMING PART OF THE MAINSTREAM AND SO I THINK AS NEW PRODUCTS COME UP. NOT JUST THE TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCTS COME UP- AGRICULTURE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND THEN INCORPORATE- LANCE THERE ARE NOT TRADITIONALLY IN YOUR WHAT YOU WOULD THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT STINKS THERE ARE KIND OF OUT OF THE BOX SO- I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THE AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY BECAUSE- WOULD HATE FOR YOU TO MISS OUT ON A ON A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE YOUR- YOUR NOW YOUR MEMBERSHIP. BUT YOUR BOTTOM LINE YOUR PRODUCT LINE. ANY OTHER. FROM I'M SORRY. I WOULD JUST NOTE TO THAT- THAT COOPERATIVE EXTENSION ALSO HAS A VERY- STRONG SUPPORT IN THE URBAN AND COMMUNITY FOR- OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE I'M AND YOU ALSO HERE IN THE FARMER PANEL FROM- DORIA ROBINSON WHO IS ALSO HEAVILY INVOLVED IN URBAN AGRICULTURE AND IT- VERY WELL RESPECTED AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE A LOT O SAY ABOUT THIS SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING HER. COMMENTS AS WELL. REALLY APPRECIATE- THAT FEEDBACK ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS. STRUCTURE AT THIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- MIKE ON THERE WE GO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO GO BACK TO- TO MICHAEL YANG I APPRECIATE HIS COMMENTS- YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF WHAT HE HAD TO SAY IN REGARDS TO THE LANGUAGE BARRIER. THAT'S OUT THERE I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITIES WE HAVE ALLOW LONG IN FILIPINO- IN SEVERAL OTHER DIALECTS- THERE IN THERE I THINK TOO OFTEN FROM A STATE BUREAUCRATIC LEVEL- BUT WE DO SEND OUT MASS LETTERS- IN THERE ARE. IT IS MULTI LINGUAL AS THEY OUGHT TO BE- SO I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WITH THAT AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE THAT- GOING BACK TO- MY- COLLEAGUE MISTER JONES SAWYER IS- COMMENTS- I'D- LIKE TO ASK WHAT HAPPENED TO THE URBAN AG PROGRAM THAT WE USED TO HAVE. I KNOW- THE SCHOOL PROGRAM THE FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM WAS MENTIONED BUT WE DID HAVE A URBAN AG PROGRAM I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FIRST UP HERE SEVEN YEARS AGO AS A FRESHMAN- IN THIS COMMITTEE. LEARNING ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE ARE DOING WORK IN SAN FRANCISCO AND OTHER AREAS TO TAKE SOME OF THESE PLOTS OF LAND IN AND TURN THEM INTO COMMUNITY GARDENS WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THAT AND HOW COME WE'RE NOT UTILIZING- THOSE TOOLS TO- BREACH SOME OF THESE GAPS. DONALD ONCE. PARK WHERE HE. THAT IS SEE IF THEY PROGRAM. IT'S THAT THAT I DO I REMEMBER THAT BACK FROM FRESHMAN YEAR READ YOU BELONG HERE LONGER THAN ME OF IT- NOW WE THERE THERE'S BEEN A IT MAY HAVE THAT. I'M HERE THANK YOU THE ALL AT THE AGENCY MANY ALSO KNOW THIS STUFF. MAYBE WE NEED TO. YEAH MAY MAYBE WE NEED TO RE LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE- I MEAN I REMEMBER TALKING ABOUT THAT I KNOW ON ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL OR SOME PROGRAMS LIKE THAT AS WELL- WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE PARTNERING- TO DO THESE THINGS AND THEN- AND- ANOTHER QUESTION BACK TO THE AGENCY- IN FRANKLY WE- WE HEAR THIS WITH ALL THE AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THE- THE FACT THAT THERE'S OUTREACH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- BUT WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW IT FOR ME IS A IS A COMBAT VETERAN EVER WHEN I GOT HOME FROM THE WAR THERE LIKE. APRIL HERE'S A BOOKLET OF YOUR BENEFITS GOOD LUCK WITH THE SIZING FONG. SO I HOPE WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN THAT- AS FAR AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GOES BECAUSE I THAT THAT'S SOMETHING I LEARNED. ON ON MY WAY UP THROUGH THROUGH COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING ELSE LEARNING ABOUT HOW GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WORK GET TOGETHERS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND IT. SO WHAT ARE WE DOING. AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP. OUR COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES LIKE MICHAEL GANGS IN AND OTHER FOLKS HELP THEM GET ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S GREAT IF WE HAVE A TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. BUT NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO GET A HOLD OF IT OR WHERE TO FIND IT IT'S USELESS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE NOT NOT JUST WITH THE AG SECTOR BUT OUR- BUREAUCRACIES IN THE STATE ACROSS THE BOARD. NOBODY NOBODY KNOWS WHERE TO GO TO ACCESS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SO WHAT'S BEING DONE TO ENSURE THAT THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS ACCESSIBLE. IS BEING ROUTED YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING I SAID. IN IN REYES USED TO MAKE FUN OF ME FOR THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE I USED TO BE LIVE WHERE WHERE IS AN APP FOR THAT. YOU KNOW WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WITH THE TAKEOVER OF THE WORLD. HOW CAN THESE GUYS DON'T HAVE AN APP THAT THEY CAN DOWNLOAD. THE THAT GIVES ON THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS RIGHT THERE ON THEIR PHONE. IN AND I KNOW PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS BECAUSE OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS ARE OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD BUT- THAT'S- I'M I'M WORKING ON A BUDGET TRAILER BILL FIX THAT ONE BUT LET WHAT IT WAS THE AGENCY DOING. THE AGENCY IS DOING. SARM A LITTLE SPICY MORNING IF. WHO'S BEST ON THE PANEL TO- RESPOND TO SOME OF OUR MATHIS IS QUESTION I'M SORRY AB I WAS ON MUTE APOLOGIZE OF THIS IS THE- WITH CDFA- AND THIS WAS WHAT I REFERRED TO WITHIN THE PRESENTATION ABOUT ON THE RELIANCE ON- LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS- COOPERATIVE EXTENSION TO ACTUALLY PROVIDE NOT ONLY APPLICATION ASSISTANCE BUT ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANT THIS IS SOMETHING- AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS PASSED ALSO TO HELP INSURE THAT IDIOT BATES CLIMATE SMART ACT PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY. WE WERE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT NOT ONLY APPLICATION ASSISTANCE BUT IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANT THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL MENTIONED THAT AS WELL AS THE FOOD SAFETY- THERE IS THE CONTINUAL NEED TO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE- STAFF CAPACITY TO BE A NEW. LOCAL YOU KNOW ALL OVER THE STATE WE RELY ON PARTNERS AND WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT BOTH PARTNERS ARE ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN IN LANGUAGES- OF THE ARAB COMMUNITY AND THEN. ALSO- TECH ASSISTANCE THAT IS. FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEN WHAT WITH REGARDS TO A AND URBAN AG PROGRAM THERE WAS URBAN AG INCENTIVE ZONING LAWS. THAT REPRESENTATIVE TEAM HELP TO PASS THAT I WASN'T AWARE OF BECAUSE I JUST STARTED IT CDFA IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- BUT- IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE COUNTIES IMPLEMENT NOT CDFA- COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS WILL BE A GOOD RESOURCE TO REFER TO FOR MORE INFORMATION. IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. AND THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT ELEVEN THIRTY SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUSH THIS DISCUSSION TO OUR NEXT PANEL BUT REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME YOU GUYS HAVE- MADE FOR- THIS HEARING- AND APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AROUND THE URBAN AG INCENTIVES PROGRAM IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SAM CISCO IN L. A. ARE THE ONLY CITIES- OR TWO OF THE LARGEST CITIES IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE ADOPTED- AND OPTED INTO THE PROGRAM SO. BUT BUT WITH THAT WE GET SOME IF- GET- SOME FOLLOW UP INFORMATION AROUND THAT BUT THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH IN OUR OUR SECOND PANEL. IS HERE TO FOCUS ON FARMER. ON ON. WHICH WHICH IS GONNA FOCUS ON FARM X. ON FOOT. ON FARMER EQUITY ISSUES AND CHALLENGES- OUR FIRST PANELIST IS. PART THREE CELL RODRIGUEZ WHO IS A STRAWBERRY GROWER AND TOGETHER WITH OUR HOUSE WITH HER HUSBAND ROSARIO. OWNS RODRIGUEZ FARMS IN CASTROVILLE CALIFORNIA. SHE STARTED IN THE FIELD AS A FARM WORKER. BEFORE TRANSITIONING TO A STRAWBERRY GROWER. SHE ALSO TRANSITION FROM BEING A TRADITIONAL GROW TO AN ORGANIC GROWER. AND CURRENTLY FARMS- NINETY ACRES SO WELCOME TO THIS HEARING MISTRUST REGUS AND- AND IF YOU ARE READY TO GO THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT WAS FOR HAVING ME AND THANK YOU ALL- I AM VERY EXCITED TO- LISTEN TO ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH THEM ASSISTANCE FOR FARMERS BECAUSE BACK WHEN. WE STARTED YOU KNOW TODAY THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE THIRTY YEARS AND LIKE YOU MENTIONED- TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND WE STARTED- FARMING AND THIS IS AFTER- YOU KNOW WORKING IN THE FIELDS OURSELVES AS SPEAKERS I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN WATSONVILLE CALIFORNIA. AND STARTED WORKING AT THE FARM SINCE I CAN REMEMBER BECAUSE WE LIVED AT THE FARM SO SINCE EARLY AGE I REMEMBER- YOU KNOW COMING OUT AND HELPING WITH WHATEVER I COULD UNTIL I BECAME AN ADULT. AND YOU KNOW WITH THAT EXPERIENCE I EIGHTY WE VENTURED OUT INTO THE FARMING WORLD TOGETHER WITH MY HUSBAND HIS FAMILY ALSO- WORK THERE. AND IT HAS BEEN A LONG AND- JUST INCREDIBLE JOURNEY BECAUSE WHEN WE STARTED AND- WE FELT THAT WE KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT FARMING YOU KNOW TO START OUR OWN BUSINESS BUT QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THERE WAS- A LOT OF IT THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IN MAINLY- A LOT OF THINGS ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT LIKE- APPLYING- FOR DIFFERENT PERMITS AND JUST FOLLOWING REGULATIONS AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE. VERY PICKERS WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THAT AND SO QUICKLY WE WERE FACED WITH A LOT OF CHALLENGES AND THE FIRST ONE WAS YOU KNOW WHEN LOOKING FOR LAND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS YOU KNOW FOR A SMALL FARMER STARTING UP TO THE ACCORDING TO LAND. AND MOST- PEOPLE WHO WERE LEASING LAND ONE AND- REFERENCES WE DID A CREDIT CHECK AND WE HAD NOTHING SO IT TOOK US YOU KNOW MONTHS UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO. FIND SOMEONE THAT WOULD JUST TAKE OUR WORD AND TRUST US YOU KNOW TO YOU KNOW PAY THEM THE RENT SO WE STARTED WITH THREE ACRES. AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER- THE OTHER CHALLENGE WAS EQUIPMENT-% MOST. OF US NEED A LOT OF YOU KNOW DE FOR TOOLS LIKE. AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS CHANNEL. WERE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM- WHEN YOU GO TO THESE PLACES THAT RENT EQUIPMENT TO THIS DAY THEY HAVE LONG APPLICATIONS. AND HALF OF IT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT ABLE TO- COMPLETE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE REFERENCES AGAIN YOU KNOW CREDIT. SO FOR MANY YEARS- WHAT WE HAD TO DO WAS JUST BE RESOURCEFUL AND GO OUT TO OTHER FARMERS AND WE KNOW OUR COMMUNITY AND ASKED TO BORROW OR RENT FROM THEM AND THAT'S HOW WE MADE IT WORK. UNTIL WE WERE SLOWLY- YOU KNOW SAVING MONEY AND ACQUIRED OUR OWN EQUIPMENT. SO I AND YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK BACK- A LOT OF WHAT I'VE LISTENED TO JUST YOU KNOW. IS A LOT OF WHAT WE WENT THROUGH WHERE. MY LOT OF THESE PLACES AND RESOURCES WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE NOW AND THERE IS YOU KNOW MORE WORK AHEAD IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WHAT. NEEDS TO BE DONE TO THE HOUSE MORE OF THESE AGENCIES OR RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR FARMERS- AND ALONG THE WAY I WANT TO THANK YOU KNOW I KNOW OR- COUNTY AGRICULTURE COMMISSIONER. THAT WAS A GREAT START BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE WE BECOME FAMILIAR WITH AND TRUST AND THAT'S A GOOD YOU KNOW. AGENCY I THINK THAT FIRST FARMERS WHEN YOU'RE STARTING OUT YOU KNOW IT'S SOMEONE YOU BECOME TO KNOWING YOU TRUST AND YOU KNOW THE STRAWBERRY COMMISSION AND THEN WHEN WE WERE FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF- TRANSITIONING TO ORGANIC. BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS NO LONGER WANT IT- CONVENTIONAL BERRIES- THAT WAS ANOTHER CHALLENGE BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS JUST LIKE STARTING OVER BECAUSE IT WAS LEARNING THE NEW FERTILIZERS OR WHAT WAS GOING TO WORK WITH THEM. YOU KNOW FARMING ORGANIC BALANCE HE COS WAS- THEY WERE VERY GOOD AND HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES FOR US. SO- OVERALL AND I'M- LIKE I SAY YOU KNOW IT'S VERY CHALLENGING WHEN YOU START. FROM THE BOTTOM FROM ZERO AND THE MAIN CHALLENGES ARE YOU KNOW THE LAND HAVE READING YOU KNOW EQUIPMENT AND THEN ASSISTANCE WITH- GETTING THE PERMITS ARE FOLLOWING REGULATIONS AND FOR ME YOU KNOW. SPEAKING ENGLISH IT WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE AND THESE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT COMMON ENGLISH WORDS THAT I WAS FAMILIAR WITH SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH HARDER IT IS FOR SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH- YES SO. NOW THIS YEAR LIKE I SAY WE CELEBRATE THIRTY YEARS AND AFTER MANY CHALLENGES I THINK WE WERE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE NEVER GAVE UP. AND WE WERE RESOURCEFUL AND I THINK MANY OF US MALL LOCAL FARMERS YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT- HELPS ME SUCCESS WELL WE JUST BECOME RESOURCEFUL. AND WORK WITH EACH OTHER. WON'T MISS RODRIGUEZ WE APPRECIATE- YOUR TESTIMONY AND EXAMPLES YOU SHARED IF YOU'LL PLEASE HOLD ON THE LINE I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL. BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US- THE NEXT PANELIST- IS DORIA ROBINSON SHE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF URBAN HEALTH A COLLECTION OF SCHOOLS AND- SOME COMMUNITY GARDENS AND SMALL URBAN FARMS IN RICHMOND- THERE USED TO TEACH AN EMPLOYEE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO GROW. TO DISTRIBUTE COOK AND EAT LOCAL PRODUCE NOTABLY SHE IS A CERTIFIED PERMACULTURE DESIGNER CERTIFIED BABY FRIENDLY GARDEN. A CERTIFIED NUTRITION EDUCATOR. AND WHAT MUST BE A VERY LIMITED TIME AND HERB AND HER LIFE SHE'S ALSO A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. A WELCOME MISS ROBINSON GROUP WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE IF THE IF MY VIDEO IS WORKING IS IT IS IT ALL GOOD YEAH I'M GOOD. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION- HERE. AND I WANT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT URBAN TOLD BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW I REALLY WANT TO GIVE A GOOD IS. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF URBAN AGRICULTURE- SO URBAN TOTH IS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION HERE IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA IN THE SAN FRANCISCO EAST BAY WERE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD- LIKE I SAID OUR MISSION IS TO HIRE AND TRAIN LOCAL RESIDENTS TO CULTIVATE AGRICULTURE FEED OUR COMMUNITY RESTORE ELATION SAYS WITH LAND. AND BUILD A MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM WITHIN A JUST AND HEALTHIER COMMUNITY I SAY THAT BECAUSE IN RICHMOND LAST WEEK EIGHTY TWO PEOPLE DIED OF CARBON JUSTIN RICHMOND WHICH MEANS THE TOWN OF A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. THAT THE WEEK BEFORE IT WAS SEVENTY FOUR. WE HAVE HIGHER INSTANCES OF THINGS LIKE KOBE IT BECAUSE WE HAVE HIGHER INSTANCES OF THINGS LIKE HEART DISEASE DIABETES OBESITY- ALL OF THESE PREVENTABLE DISEASES- BUT WE ALSO HAVE REALLY POOR ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS WE HAVE TONS OF CONVENIENCE STORES FAST FOOD. JOINTS AND ONE FULL SERVICE GROCERY STORE. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS ENDING FOOD DESERT INCLUDE SWAMPS- HELPING RESIDENTS RECONNECT WITH THEIR OWN HEALTH IT SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DECREASE OUR VULNERABILITY TO STARKEY MUNITY LIKE COBIT NINETEEN. CURRENTLY WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IS WE EMPLOY FORTY FOUR RICHMOND SAN PABLO RESIDENTS MOSTLY YOUTH OF COLOR FROM THIS COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT- TO WORK ON OUR SIX DIFFERENT SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY GARDENS AND URBAN FARMS HERE IN RICHMOND WE HAVE TO CSA'S. ONE CSA IS A FOOD IT'S A FOOD BOX PROGRAM- SERVICE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FAMILIES- DELIVERING. FOOD THAT WE GROW FOOD THAT WE GET FROM SMALL BY PARK LOCAL FARMERS- IT SAYS SUBSIDIZE THAT MEMBER SUBSIDIZED CSA SO SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO PAY MORE SO WE CAN MAKE VERY LOW INCOME BOXES AVAILABLE SAME BOX DIFFERENT PRICE. AND THEN AS OF CODE WHEN KOBE BEGAN WE STARTED A SECOND CSA PER TWO HUNDRED FAMILIES THIS IS EVERY WEEK- COMPLETELY FREE FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE EXTREMELY. IMPACTED BY COPA CONVEYED. WHAT REALIZED IN THE COURSE OF DOING NOW FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOXES A WEEK DELIVERED TO PEOPLE'S HOMES IS THAT WE HAD EXTREME FOOD ACCESS ISSUES ONE GOING BEFORE KOBE KOBE JUST MADE IT REALLY APPARENT- WE ALSO HAVE SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS YOU'VE BEEN TEACHING IN URBAN AGRICULTURE IN AMERICAN FOOD SYSTEMS CLASS AT RICHMOND HIGH SCHOOL AS A PART OF AN ELECTIVE COURSE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WE JUST ACTUALLY GOT THAT- UPGRADED SO NOW IT'S- COLLEGE SCIENCE- CREDIT COURSE. WELL AND WE HAVE A SUMMER YOUTH APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM FOR FORTY YOUTH EVERY SUMMER THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR FOURTEEN YEARS GETTING LOTS OF YOUTH IRVINE YOUTH EXCITED ABOUT FARMING MANY OF THOSE YOU THAT THEY USE THAT BECOME- OUR FARM MANAGERS ARE FARM COORDINATORS- THAT ARE RUNNING THESE PROGRAMS I'M TALKING ABOUT- THE USDA. SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FREE CSA PROGRAM- THROUGH THEIR FARMERS TO FAMILIES PROGRAM. DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THAT PROGRAM AND THEN GROWING THE TABLE TOOK OVER TO HELP FUND IT. WE ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM. WITH THE LOCAL- MEDICAL CLINIC AND LYFT ONE MEDICAL CENTER TO DO A VEGGIE ARE EX PROGRAM WHICH IS FREE CSA BOXES GOING TO. THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE ACTUALLY STRUGGLING WITH CHRONIC DISEASE WHO WANT TO MAKE CHANGES IN THEIR IN THEIR HEALTH- FREEZE- CSA BOXES- AS A PART OF A PRESCRIPTION FROM THEIR DOCTOR. TO HELP THEM IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND DECREASE THE IMPACTS OF THE KIND OF KIND OF DISEASE AND SOME AND SOME IN SOME CASES REVERSE IT. I WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT ALL OF OUR PROJECTS ARE ON PUBLIC LANDS. ON SCHOOL DISTRICT LAND ITS CITY LANDS IT'S COUNTY LANDS WE HAVE A VERY TENUOUS TENDENCY A TENDENCY- IN OUR ON OUR GARDENS FOR A FOR THESE SIXTEEN YEARS WE NEVER KNOW. FOR MOST OF THEIR LOCATIONS IT WILL BE THERE THE NEXT YEAR ALTHOUGH WE BUILT SUCH A STRONG REPUTATION WITHIN THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY ALL FROM THIS COMMUNITY. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY IN PLACE BUT IF IT IS A QUESTION AND IT'S BEEN HARD TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HELPS GET COULD HELP US SCALE OUR IMPACT. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE THERE ABOUT PEOPLE WE SAY WE CAN ONLY DO TEMPORARY THINGS- MOST RECENTLY WE PARTNER WITH SUPERVISOR JOHN GIOIA HAD TO DEVELOP THE NORTH RICHMOND FARM WHICH IS A THREE ACRE FARM IN NORTH RICHMOND. ON COUNTY LAND IT WAS A LOT OF CASH OF A VACANT LOT FOR FORTY YEARS AND SUPERVISOR GIOIA FOUNDED AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE. WHAT IS NOW THE BEGINNING OF THE NORTH RICHMOND FARM- IT CURRENTLY HAS A ACRE IN PRODUCTION AFTER A LONG PROCESS TO GET TO THIS POINT. I'LL SAY A LITTLE FEW WORDS ABOUT THAT LATER- AND- NINETY THREE TREAT WORKERS ORCHARD CRYING APRICOTS PEARS PERSIMMONS APPLES THE REST IS IN ROW CROPS. SO I WANTED TO SEE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE STATE I FEEL HAS BEEN DOING REALLY RIGHT- WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT HAS REALLY WORKED FOR US. AND PEOPLE OF SAID UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION I WANT TO SAY THAT AGAIN- WE GET SO MUCH REALLY HIGH QUALITY SUPPORT FROM THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION HERE ROB BENNINGTON AND EVERYONE THERE WE GOT SUPPORT WITH HIS MAN- MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE COMPLIANT AND HOW THAT THE SAFETY PLAN IN PLACE. AND THEY HELPED US THROUGH THAT PROCESS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. WE'RE ACTUALLY FROM THIS COMMUNITY FROM VERY FEW OF US HAVE HAVE- YOU KNOW DEGREES AND ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN AND IT'S A PRETTY ARDUOUS PROCESS TO- BE FOODS FOOD SAFETY CERTIFIED- WE HAVE- WE'VE GOTTEN ADDED VALUE PRODUCT CREATION SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND HOW DID YOU MAKE ADDED VALUE PRODUCTS LEGALLY. FROM THE UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION WE'VE GOTTEN TRAINING FUND I PM IN DEALING WITH PESTS IN ORGANIC SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT AND IF COSTA TRAINING AT OUR FARM ON SALE HELP FOR OTHER OF URBAN FARMERS. THEY'VE JUST BEEN AN INVALUABLE RESOURCE ALSO. THE WAY THAT CDFA HAS IT AIMS TO CSA I. HAS BEEN. HELPFUL IT REALLY SIMPLE. MAINTAIN A VALID CS LIES. AND TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT FOOD HOPE THAT CONNECTOR FOR OUR FAMILIES IN RICHMOND'S SOON WHOLE HEALTHY FOOD- AND SO I JUST WANTED TO REALLY POINT THAT OUT AND SAY THAT THOSE THINGS ARE GOING. REALLY RIGHT- AND THEN JUST ALSO WANT TO SAVE THAT COMMUNITY. ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ALLIANCE- COMMUNITY ALLIANCE WITH FAMILY FARMERS- THE CENTER FOR LAND BASED LEARNING AND- URBAN EDGE FARM IN BRENTWOOD. SPIRAL GARDENS BRING SECURITY PROJECT AN OXEN ARSENIC QUALITY CENTER ALL PLACES THAT. HAVE REALLY HELPED US GROW THROUGH THEIR WORKSHOPS THROUGH JUST PEER TO PEER TRAINING WITH URBAN EDGE FARM THEY HELPED US PUT TOGETHER OUR NURSERY. AND ARE GREENHOUSE SYSTEMS KIND OF SHARED WHAT THEY WERE DOING ON THEIR FARM WITH OUR YOUNG FARMERS I WILL EXCHANGE. GOING ON THERE. AND IT'S A HELPFUL I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT THAT I HOPE THE STATE CAN REALLY SUPPORT THOSE. GROUPS THAT ARE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE REACHING OUT TO OTHER GROUPS TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. AND FINALLY I WANTED TO HIT ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THE LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED THEM OWNERSHIP THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE TO S. FOR US- UNTIL DAYS LIKE I SAID COMPLETELY RUN BY RICHMOND SAN PABLO RESIDENTS. WE DON'T HAVE MONEY WE DON'T HAVE CREDIT. WE DON'T HAVE ASSETS. WE DON'T HAVE A PATHWAY TO REALLY OWNING- ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THROUGH THE WINTER PIERRE GRANT PROGRAMS. AND- AND SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAME ON THE NORTH RICHMOND FARM PROJECTS. IT WAS LIKE SUCH A BLESSING AND- AND AS WE'RE DEVELOPING REALIZING THAT WE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE PERMANENT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED WE REALLY NEED TO OWN THE LAND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET ACCESS TO THE FUNDS WE NEED TO DEVELOP AN INFRASTRUCTURE- AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WITH CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WHO REALLY SUPPORTS OUR PROJECT. IS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IT EXCEPT FOR THE NEW SURPLUS LAND ACT. IT IS ACTUALLY BLOCKING THE SALE OF THE PROPERTY TO US- BECAUSE IT HAS TO FIRST BE OFFERED TO LOW INCOME HOUSING. AND YOU KNOW I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE AN EXEMPTION IN THE SURPLUS LAND ACT THAT ALLOWS FOR PROJECTS LIKE OURS THAT ARE WORKING TOWARDS IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY BY USING SURPLUS. PUBLIC LAND FOR GROWING- I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP I MEAN ESPECIALLY AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF WORKING ON THIS PROJECT TO BE AMENDED THE GENERAL PLAN WE NEGOTIATED A THIRTY YEAR LEASE WE BY RESTORING THE SOIL WE BUILT TEMPORARY INFRASTRUCTURE WE CREATED A LONG TERM BUILDING PLANET CAPITAL CAMPAIGN. AND PASSED THE WHOLE SEQUEL PROCESS WHICH WAS CRAZY DIFFICULT AND NOW IS IN DANGER OF LOSING THE WHOLE- THE WHOLE PROJECT. YOU KNOW TOWARDS A GOOD ENDS BECAUSE WE WANT TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME HOUSING BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS ALSO A NEED THAT OUR COMMUNITY HOUSE. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK REALLY BRIEFLY ABOUT THE AGRICULTURE INCENTIVE ZONES THAT THAT FOLKS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THE URBAN AG- KIND OF TAX INCENTIVE. SO THAT WAS REALLY CELEBRATE IT WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENS. EXCEPT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DETAILS REALIZE THAT PLACES LIKE RICHMOND DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE WE HAVE A POPULATION OF A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND INSTEAD OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. SO ALTHOUGH OUR- CITY GOVERNMENT WANTED TO GET INVOLVED WE ACTUALLY DID A QUALIFIED WOMAN ONCE AGAIN I'M SORRY MY DOG. ISRAEL DURING COVERED YOU'RE GOOD. AND AND SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT UP AND SAY THAT IF THAT IF THAT DIDN'T HAVE THAT THE THAT SCALE OF CITY WAS THE ONLY TYPE OF CITY WHO THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT ACT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT MORE CITIES WOULD UTILIZE IT- BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY A BARRIER RICHMAN IS ACTUALLY REALLY RICH IN VACANT LOTS AND WE HAVE LOTS OF FOOD INSECURITY AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN URBAN AGRICULTURE SO WE COULD MAKE THE MAGIC CARE BUT THERE'S LIMITATIONS TO WITH THE WITH THAT ACT IS WRITTEN. AND I JUST KIND OF PUT FORWARD AGAIN THE SURPLUS LAND ACT JUST AN EXEMPTION FOR FOOD SECURITY PROJECT IS A GOOD USE OF SURPLUS- PUBLIC LANDS AND THEN JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TRIED TO ACCESS QUIPPED AND HEALTHY SOILS- BUT BOTH ARE NOT SUITED AT ALL FOR URBAN AGRICULTURE EQUIPPED ESPECIALLY IS RELEASED IS REALLY BACK TO SUPPORT LARGER FARMS IT'S BASED ON SCALE STEP YOU'RE GROWING AT A VERY SMALL SCALE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT YOU GET. IS BASED ON YOUR ACREAGE. SENATE THE M. OF NEED WHAT YOUR TO DO- IT IS NOT WORTH ALL OF THE PAPERWORK AND ALL OF THE THINGS FOR A VERY VERY SMALL SUPPORT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MEET YOUR NEEDS- IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH DISORDERS PROGRAM. AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT ONLY REALLY SUPPORTS- FOLKS THAT ARE STARTING NEW HEALTHY SOIL PROJECT. PRACTICES SO WE ALREADY ARE USING COVER CROPPING AND- YOU KNOW DRIP IRRIGATION AND KIND OF ALL THE PRACTICE OF YOUR ORGANIC FARM- FARMING OPERATION SO WE CAN'T ACTUALLY ACCESS HEALTHY SOILS EITHER. BECAUSE NOTHING WOULD BE NEW WE'RE WE'RE ALREADY DOING ALL THESE THINGS WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THEM THE WAY THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO AN AT SCALE- AND FINALLY WHEN I WANTED TO PUT FORTH AN IDEA AND THAT IS. OUR VEGGIE ARE EX PROGRAM IS REALLY PHENOMENAL- TRYING TO ACTUALLY WORK- TO PREVENT. ANY DISEASE THAT MAKES OUR POPULATION REALLY VULNERABLE TO THINGS LIKE KOBE OR JUST. YOU KNOW A LIFETIME ARE OLD AT THE END OF LIFE BEING REALLY- JUST DISASTROUS AND REALLY IMPACTFUL FOR OUR HEALTH- SYSTEM WHICH IS QUITE POOR WE LOST OUR LOCAL HOSPITAL. A FEW YEARS BACK. AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO PUT FORWARD THE IDEA THAT. YOU KNOW FOOD CAN BE AND SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE. AND IF IT COULD BE INCLUDED IN COUNTY AND STATE HEALTH PLANS SO THAT A PRESCRIPTION FOR HARDLY BOX OF FOOD FOR VERY LOW INCOME FAMILY THAT WOULDN'T NORMALLY BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT- THAT ACTUALLY COULD BE REVOLUTIONARY- BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT AS AN ACCEPTABLE THING TO INCLUDE IN THE HEALTH AND COVERAGE- BIKE MEDICINES. OR IN SOME CASES SOME FOLKS YOU KNOW CAN USE THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO GO TO THE GYM OR WHATEVER- A BOX OF. HEALTHY WHOLE NUTRIENT DENSE FOOD EVERY WEEK COULD BE A REALLY GOOD THING AND THAT WOULD HELP US SUPPORT THE SMALL FARMERS. YOU KNOW SUPPORT OUR GROWING PRACTICE AND SUPPORT FAMILIES THAT REALLY JUST CAN'T AFFORD THIS KIND OF FOOD. AND THEN TO PUT THAT OUT IDEA OUT THERE AND. THEN FINALLY JUST SAY- TO COME SEE US. I WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PERFECT PEOPLE USUALLY PRETTY NEW WE WELCOME EVERYONE TO COME AND SEE THE NORTH RICHMOND FARM AND ALL OF OUR OTHER SITES- AND SEE WHAT URBAN FARMS CAN DO TO IMPACT HEALTH- TO CREATE LOCAL FOOD BASED BUSINESSES- AND REALLY INSPIRE YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE POSITIVE CHANGES- NINETY THE FARMERS THAT WE NEED IN THE FUTURE. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME MISS ROBINSON REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS AND I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW- MOST IF NOT ALL OF WHAT YOU SAID AS FAR AS YOUR TAKE ON FOOD FOR MEDICINE- CERTAINLY LOOKING AT OUR FOOD SYSTEM AND REFORMINGIT WHERE WE CAN- IS YOU KNOW CERTAINLY A GOAL OF MINE AND- IS- YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE AS A STATE NEED TO ASPIRE TO- ACCOMPLISH- BUT WITH THAT BUT CERTAINLY WILL TAKE UP YOUR OFFER TO GO OUT THERE AND- AND- SEE THOSE ARE C. OPERATION LOOK FOR TO DOING THAT. AND OUR FINAL PANELIST FOR THE DAY IS MINE WHEN IS A CINEMA COUNTY FARMER A CHAIR OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN FARMERS ALLIANCE- IS THE WIND GROWS HAIR LOOM GRAIN AND SOUTHEAST ASIAN CROPS AS AN ACTIVIST ORGANIZER FOR FARMING EQUITY ISSUES INCLUDING CURRENTLY AS CO DIRECTOR OF THE NOW AND ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON LAND TENURE FOR FARMERS OF COLOR AND WITH RESPECT FOR INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY- MISSING WHEN- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. I EXTRAPOLATE. HELLO WELL IT'S SORT OF GREAT ARTICLES THAT IRISH GAELIC FOR IPC DAY THE WIND DAY OF THE YEAR THAT I GET TO FLEX MONEY CELTIC STUDIES MAJOR SO AS NOT TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY I'M REALLY HONORED BOTH TO. HOW DO YOU RECEIVE ME AND ALSO BUT MANY FARMERS UPON HEARING THIS OPPORTUNITY REACHED OUT NEED THE LEFT OF VARIOUS IMPORTANT ISSUES. SUCH THAT BY LAST NIGHT I CONSIDER JUST GETTINGOUTLINED IN REMARKS AND JUST SIMPLY READING YEAR THEIR TEXTS AND- PLAYING YOUR VOICE MAILS- BUYING BROWN LIKE ONE IN THE MORNING. I THOUGHT I HAD IT COVERED AND- THEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO MESSAGES EXPRESSING ANXIETY AND. DESPAIR AND CONDOLENCES- I DIDN'T UNDER THAT. I READ THE NUNES ABOUT THE ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN GUNNED DOWN LAST NIGHT IN THAT MANNER. I THOUGHT ABOUT MINIMUM. RACIALLY MOTIVATED THREATS OF VIOLENCE THAT EXPERIENCE LAWLER IS FARMING MENDOCINO. FARMERSUSING AMERICAN ALLIED FARMERS ALLIANCE YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE RESTAURANT GROCERY CUSTOMERS LAST YEAR RODRIGUEZ IS UNIVERSAL B. R. FUELED YOU KNOW BY OUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENT BECAUSE PEOPLE TO AVOID USING AMERICAN ESTABLISHMENTS. KNOWN EVEN ENTIRE CHINATOWNS. SO THERE'S SO MUCH I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU- SO MUCH TO SYNTHESIZE AMEX. YOU KNOW THE FEELING BECAUSE YOUR- REPRESENTATIVES OF LARGE DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES SO I DON'T I DON'T IN THE AIR- BUT YOU KNOW I SIGNED UP FOR THIS. I'M AN INDEPENDENT FARM OWNER OPERATOR MANY AGENTS ANIMAL ROTATION AND STRIKE FARMING RELYING EXCLUSIVELY ON OUR INCREASINGLY SCALE TO YOUR GRATEFUL FOR YOUR NATION- AND I MANAGING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY MEMBER CSA- I NEEDED THEIR SHARE INFORMATION LAST NIGHT YOU KNOW SO. I'M ALSO A MOTHER NONPROFIT DIRECTORS MENTIONED AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY BEING HIT HARD BY THE PANDEMIC IN MODERN SLAVERY SYMPTOMS. OF SYSTEMIC ILLS. YOU KNOW I'M HERE RIGHT YOU DURING RIGHT AT THE TIME. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A WINTER BREAK I LOST TEN PEOPLE. TWO MORE AND IT'S NOT AGE. SO I AM LOOKING TO COME WITH THIS ALL. I AM ALSO WONDERING WHAT IS THE SO MUCH WEIGHT ON MOMENT. WHY NOT SO FARMERS FIELD THIS IS A CHIU. TO CONNECT TO YOU. OKAY MAYBE HEARD IN MEETINGS WE INCLUDING. ON A REGULAR BASIS. SO THAT WE'RE NOT RELYING JUST ON THESE MOMENTS. THESE QUESTIONS CAN HELP US ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF IMPLEMENTING THE FORMER EQUITY ACT AND- RACIAL EQUITY EFFORTS. SO I AM I WAS A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA FORMER JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE AND THEN BEFORE IT WAS THE COLLABORATION OF THE COLLABORATIVE- THAT GROUP THAT WAS A FOR MENTIONED AND- YEAH CONCEDING. AND CHUCK CHAMPIONING OF IRAQ ACT I STILL TO THIS COMMITTEE FOUR YEARS AGO- WITH THE HOPE THAT THE ACT'S PASSAGE WOULD MEAN THAT FARMERS OF COLOR WOULD HAVE A GREATER. INFLUENCE AND NOT JUST ACCESS INFLUENCE OVER THE SECURITY PROGRAMS THROUGH EQUITABLE PROCESS USE. FOR EQUITABLE OUTCOMES. WELL I'M KIND OF A FULL HEALTHY MIND. SO WHEN ASKED AND STILL HOPE TO MANDATE IN THOSE WORDS OF THAT TAX THAT YOU KNOW CORDAGE THAT ENSURES THE INCLUSION OF SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND RANCHERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE LAWS. REGULATIONS AND POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. I THOUGHT IT INCLUDING WOULD MORE POINTS OF CONTACT. HE'S MAKING US THE GEYSERS AND MAYBE I'M INTO STOCKS. TO ENSURE THE SECOND COMES. NUMBER LIKE IT'S NATURAL IT'S BEEN DONE FOR YEARS AND THE FIRST ARMORED YOU CAN UNIFIED PLATFORMERS- HAPPENED YESTERDAY. SO IMPLEMENTATION JUST HASN'T SEEMS TO MATCH THE URGENCY OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM THAT IS STRUCTURAL RACISM AND THAT IS OUR EXPOSURE TO PREMATURE DEATH. PERSONALLY I'VE BEEN A FORMER BUSINESS OWNER FOR SIX YEARS KNOW HOW TO MOVE THREE TIMES MOTION WAS RECENTLY BECAUSE MY LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER BUILT A HORSE RIDING FACILITY ON TOP OF ME RAPING GREEN. BECAUSE HER OR STRANGE FACILITY SHUT DOWN TO PREVENT. AND IT WAS REALLY HARD COMPLETE THE COURSE FOR THAT. OKAY CHALLENGES ACCESSING CAPITAL BUILD NEEDED REGIONAL GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH MORE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE NOW AS CRITICAL AS WE'VE CALLED. THE FLOWER SHELVES LAST YEAR. YEAH AND I FARMS THREE SEVEN WILDFIRE SEASONS EVACUATING TWICE I MOST RECENTLY WITH. A SIX MONTH OLD BABY DESPERATELY CRYING OUT OF HUNGER FOR ME- I COULDN'T REACH HER BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO DRIVE US TO SAFETY. SO BY THE TIME COMING HERE. YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY STILL KIND OF LARGELY REMAINED ON OUR OWN- IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF SHELTER IN PLACE- I SPOKE WITH HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT FARMERS LIKE. THE RIGHT PHONE YOUR PEOPLE ASKING ME HOW TO CHANGE THEIR SALES CHANNELS REPEAT THEIR KIDS HAVE TAKEN THE PRECAUTIONS- I KNOW IN THE BALLPARK OR THOUGHT OF LAST ABOUT ALL. I GATHERED FIRED BY TALK. MUSICIANS AND MANDELA PARTNERS ALL THE FIRST NATIONS DON'T INSTITUTE COULD YOU ALL OF OUR USERS. I PROJECT- AND YOUR WE CREE EIGHT BY TALK WILL FUND FORMER AND WE ARE STEWART RECOGNIZE THAT ENDED PEOPLE. DON'T NECESSARILY. UNDERSTAND THE K. OF FARMERS AND RANCHERS ARE AS YOU KNOW SEE IF MIGHT. I DON'T REMEMBER REACHED OUT TO START INTO. YES YOU TO SEE WORLD AVAILABLE RIGHT THERE'S THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER KINDS OF. RESOURCES YEAR WE- AND RAISED EIGHT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR DIRECT LINE- AND SHIFT THOUSAND DOLLAR FOR. TRANSLATION AND CULTURE SKILLED MAYES ON. THAT WOULD BE WORK TO GET TO. I'M NOT EXPECTING THEM TO FIND OUT- ALSO NEW FORM. RIGHT NEEDED MARTIN MARKETS AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR JOBS FOOD SO I RAISE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR GROUP PLANS FOURTEEN BY PROPERTIES. IN SAN DIEGO. LONG FOR GOVERNOR FUNDS THEIR AGGREGATE SYSTEM AND FINALLY REST ON THIS TWO HUNDRED. MODOC DOLLARS WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR AGGREGATION JUST STARTED AND GOT FOUR HUNDRED ARE TO- FAMILY MANY AND MANY OF RELY THEIR JOB. NO LEARNING TO WRITE YOU KNOW NATIVE COMMUNITY WILL JUST. SUFFER WE SHOULD BE ADDRESS ON THE COVER TO GO BASE BUT- I USED MY LOGISTICS BACKGROUND TWO MILLION SIX THOUSAND POUNDS OF MEAT JANITOR RESERVATIONS- IN DIRE NEED OF SEEING. MEET YOU KNOW DAYS ON TOP OF THE FOUR WEEKS THAT OTHERS HAD ALREADY BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON THIS- BECAUSE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TAKES RESOURCES OUT OF NATIVE. COMMUNITIES BUT NOT IN. SO THAT WAS ONE TWENTY. THREE YEARS. THE AMERICAN ACT PASSED MOST THREE WE ARE JUST. NO WONDER DO YOU KNOW WHY. BUT- THIRTY MORE STRUCTURES TO BUILD TRUST WITH FARMERS THEY HAD SOMEONE TO CALL. NO ONE REALLY STILL HUSTLING BURKE RESOURCES INSTEAD OF HAVING AN EQUITABLY RESPONSIVE GOVERNMENT. SO YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S THE QUESTION OF WELL HOW HOW'S THE FORMER ACTING USE. SO FAR THE- BEST YEAR FAR DEFINITION HAS BEEN USED TO CREATE SUB SIDES FOR OUTREACH TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO LEARN ABOUT PROGRAMS SUCH AS- MEMBERS HEALTH IS WEALTH I MEAN I REALLY PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAMS CREATED BY AND FOR WHITE PEOPLE. CENTERING WHITE PEOPLE AS THE NORM THE UNIVERSAL AND PULLING RESOURCES RUN ONE IS WHITE SUPREMACY. SO ONE ONE THE TERM THAT WE CREATE IS GETTING USE YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T INTENDED FOR TO BE USED TO ACCESS WHITE SUPREMACISTS POLICIES INSTRUCTORS- INTERPRETATION AND TRANSLATION TO ACCESS WHITE SUPREMACISTS POLICIES IS NOT EQUITY. EQUITY OF ACCESS DOESN'T GUARANTEE THE NEEDED. EQUITY OF OUTCOMES. AND I'M NOT REALLY EVEN THAT WE HAVE A UNDER OF. YOU THE CVS CARE ACT REPORT DOESN'T THE- AND THAT MAKES IT HARD TO THE WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS. COM DEFINITION. SO THAT THAT'S ACTIVELY USING MY COMMUNITY THAT. AREN'T RECYCLED IS THE PROPOSAL RESOURCING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DISPROPORTIONATE EXTRACTION OPPRESSION AND HARM. EQUITY REQUIRES AN ACCURATE APPRAISAL OF THE PAST WHOSE LAND AND ALWAYS WORK IN MY ACCEPTANCE STOLEN. YEAH THAT NEEDS TO BE PAIRED WITH AN ACTION PLAN FOR APOLOGY REPAIR AND HEALING. AND THE REPORT DIDN'T DO THAT YEAH I UNDERSTAND C. B. AS IN PARKING UNDERSTANDING THAT'S THE STREET RIGHT NOW. EDUCATING PEOPLE ON THAT HISTORY IS NOT EQUITY WORK ESPECIALLY MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE RIGHT IN THE PARKING RESOURCE. TO BE PART ABOUT SORT OF WORKPLACE. BUT YEAH IT JACKSON KIND OF OPPOSITE EQUITY. SO THIS IS WHY EXPLICIT RAP WORK LIKE- WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES WE'RE MENTIONED EXENCIAL- GOING BACK TO THIS DEFINITION RACIAL EQUITY BEING PROPORTIONATELY FOR DISCORDANT EXTRACTION WE NEED EQUITY OF PROCESS OWNERSHIP AND OUTCOMES FOR FARMERS OF COLOR. THIS NEEDS INCLUDING US IN CLEAR CONSISTENT ACCOUNTABLE DECISION MAKING PROCESSES THAT ACCOUNT FOR OUR CULTURAL WAYS ORGANIZING AS WE'VE SEEN BRUCE MICHAEL AND MANY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS DO YOU. HAVE BEEN INCLUDES ABOUT LIKE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS ACTION- WE NEED OWNERSHIP OVER THE CONDITIONS OF OUR LIVES PROCESSES WERE OWNERSHIP. OF THESE CONDITIONS GREENLANDERS KNOWLEDGE MEANS OF PRODUCTION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. ULTIMATELY WE NEED. THAT THIS PROCESS IS AN OWNERSHIP FOR THE AQABA. OUTCOMES YOU KNOW LIKE. WE SEEN ALL THESE BY CHART WHERE. A MORE RATES ARE CHARTS AND SO THAT THE LONGEST BAR IS WHITE PEOPLE AND THEN EVERYBODY ELSE IS TO REMARKABLE. AND WE NEED TO DO IS DO THE EQUITABLE WORK SO THAT WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL AT THE MAX THEY'RE ALL. THANKS FOR AND HEALTHY LIFE. THE CARD ABOUT WORKS HERE IS DOING THE WORK INSIDE I KNOW THAT THE MANDATE- WITHINTHE FORMER EQUITY ACT IS IT A RELATIONSHIP BASED. TITANIC BUT I THINK ALSO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT EQUITY AMONGST OURSELVES- IN THE REPORT TALKS ABOUT HIRING EQUITY IN HIRING- AND THEN WE TALK ABOUT. IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD THEY MIGHT ALSO HAVE TO BE EQUITY AND EATING RIGHT BUT- BUT AS NEW PEOPLE ARE HELD TO THE STANDARD. OF HAVING ANY REFLECT FRAMEWORK BUT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN THESE POSITIONS HAVE A RACIAL EQUITY FRAMEWORK EN MASSE CRITERIA FOR THEM I'M TO YOU KNOW MAINTAIN THEIR JOBS BECAUSE LEARN FROM THE PEAK PER CASE THAT THE REST. AS- WHICH IS LARGELY CONSIDER TO TRY AND RECOGNIZE RECTIFYING JUST YOU RACE I'M- THE REST STAFF. WERE RACIST TOWARD US FOR. STILL HELD THEIR JOB. NEWS FORMER STILL TO BE THE SAME PEOPLE AND REGIONAL ARE. INTERNAL WORK IS. FOR GENET'S THE FOUR YEARS IT'S SAY THAT SPANISH PERIOD OF I'M BUT YOU KNOW TWENTY TWENTY SHOWED MORE PEOPLE THAT REALLY KNOW TRYING TO. HOW. WORKINGS NEEDLESSLY DIE IN ONE YEAR THIS CALL. IN BLACK OF COLOR. THANK YOU MY COMMUNITY SO DISILLUSIONED WITH GOVERNMENT THAT GOING TO SLOW THE GOVERNMENT CAN DO SWITCHED WHEN IT WANTS TO HAVE BEEN A GOOD URGENCY WAS SWIFT TO BAIL OUT THE AIRLINES AND FIND KHRISTICH HOUSE CHANGE. YEAH I HEAR THAT PEOPLE SAY GOVERNMENT AND CARE ABOUT US DOESN'T LISTEN ANY ONE PARTICULAR GROUP BUT WE SAW HOW SWIFTLY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. SODA TAX LOBBYIST LARGELY SHE QUESTIONS SHE CAN ACTIVELY STARTING SERVICE EXPERTS LARGELY ABDICATED. BY BLACKBURN EACH. SO GOVERNMENT CAN MOVE QUICKER. ARMS RACE EQUITY TO THE MERGER. THAT AGE RANGE DEATH. WE CAN AT YOU NEED COVERED BY FAR REALLY PACKAGE FROM THIS. RECENT THE CALIFORNIA JUST COLLABORATOR STATE. FOR ABOUT THE RECORD. EXIST THERE'S THE- YOU'RE TWENTY RIGHT CALIFORNIA FARMER REPORT- THAT HAS FOR. ALL SHE- DIRECTOR AN ORGANIZATION WORKING ON FORMALLY REFORM OF COLOR WITH RESPECT FOR INDIGENOUS. SOVEREIGNTY IN REPATRIATION. SO WE CAN DO IT WE HAVE THE SOLUTIONS. AND WE WORK TOGETHER FOR EQUITY. SO WHAT DOES NOT BE THE ONLY FORUM YOU'RE HEARING FROM US. LET'S TAKE THE PART EQUITY ACT TO THE MAX AND ENGAGE IN A LITTLE COLD PROCESS THESE FEDERAL RELIABLE TRUSTED RELATIONSHIPS. CENTER FARMERS OF COLOR FOR EQUITABLE OWNERSHIP OF OUR STREETS AND EQUITABLE OUTCOMES SO WE ALL ENJOYED A HEALTHY AND PEACEFUL. SOCIETY CORRECT.
