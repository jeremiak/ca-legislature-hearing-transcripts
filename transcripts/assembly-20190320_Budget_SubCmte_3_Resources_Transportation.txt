SO THEM THE REQUESTED -- WE HOUSE STAFF AND CONTRACT FUNDS WILL PROVIDE BASICALLY THREE THINGS ONE IS EXPERTISE IN THE INTERPRETATION OF POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS. THAT MAY RESULT FROM EXPOSURES TO AIR -- TOXICS OBSERVED THROUGH THE AIR QUALITY MONITORING DATA AND THE EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS FROM REDUCING THOSE HE MISSIONS. IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE WHEN THEY GET INFORMATION ON WHAT'S IN THE AIR THAT THEY'RE BREATHING THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE HEALTH OF FACTS. AND AS THOSE LEVELS ARE REDUCED WATER THE HEALTH -- WHAT ARE THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND WE WILL? WE WILL PLAY A BIG ROLE IN DETERMINING THAT. SECOND OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTH GUIDANCE VALUES THAT ARE NEEDED TO FULLY ANALYZE. THE BE -- HEALTH EFFECTS AND BENEFITS OF REDUCE. OF THOSE POLLED LIEUTENANTS -- AND BY HEALTH GUIDES VALUES WE ME NUMBERS THAT WE DEVELOP THROUGH WE'VE THIRD THIRD RUI VALUATIONS. THAT TYPICALLY IDENTIFIED LEVELS OF LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTANTS THAT DO NOT POSE HEALTH RISKS AND SO IF THE IF THE LEVELS ARE ABOVE THAT -- IT GENERALLY. RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THOSE HEALTH RISKS ARE. SO -- THERE IS -- WE WILL BE TO DEVELOPING HEALTH GUIDANCE VALUES WHERE WE NEED TO AND THIRD. THE I'M DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TARGETED BY A MONITORING STUDIES -- TO TRACK EXPOSURES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND BIO MONITORING PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE LEVELS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS IN PEOPLE. AND IT'S A DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF YOU -- TO TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICALS. ADDED ANSWERS SORT OF THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IF I KNOW WHAT'S IN THE AIR WHAT'S GETTING INSIDE ME. AND THESE STUDIES SO THEN WILL HELP COMPLEMENT INVALIDATE THE AIR MONITORING. IN N V.

AND IF I COULD ASK YOU -- TO BRIEFLY PRESENT -- TO YOUR TO I I I DO ONCE HAD OR HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED BCP'S BUT I AM CONCERNED TED THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE WITHIN THE PESTICIDE REGULATION FUND AND IT APPEARS THAT EXPENDITURES ARE GREATER THAN REVENUES. AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME NOW -- ABSENT ANY ACTION -- FURTHER ACTION OF THE BUDGET APPEARS THAT THE FUND IS GOING TO BE IN THE RED SO IF YOU COULD ADDRESS WHETHER -- THERE'S A PLAN TO CORRECT THIS -- THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YES SIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY MY NAME IS THERESA MARKS ON THE ACTING DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JESSE QUITE THIS HE WAS ONE OF OUR SYSTEM DIRECTORS -- AT AT LIKE TO START WITH JUST A BRIEF OVER VIEW IF I CAN'T ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT SURE -- OUR MISSION IS TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BY REGULATING PESTICIDES SALES AND USE ABOUT FOSTERING REDUCE RISK PEST MANAGEMENT. WE ALSO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT FOR LOCAL PESTICIDE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS IN ALL OF ALL FIFTY FIVE COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR COMPOUND STAFF OF APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY BIOLOGIST. OUR PROPOSED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET IS A HUNDRED TEN MILLION AND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT POSITIONS WHICH INCLUDE TO BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS REQUESTING FOR POSITIONS. KNOCK OVER THOSE VERY BRIEFLY NOW OUR FIRST B. C. P. IS -- A IS UP FOR A POSITION OR INFORMATION SECURITY TEAM IT'S A REQUEST FOR FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND FOR ON GOING COST ANNUALLY THEREAFTER FROM DPR. FUND TO COMPLY WITH STATE REQUIRE SEVENTY SECURITY ASSESSMENT REMEDIATION AND CLOUD MIGRATION SECURITY HARDWARE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. WITH THE ADDITION OF THREE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPECIALIST TO FUNCTION AS ITS INFORMATION SECURITY TEAM DPR WILL BE BETTER SITUATED TO MEET THESE NEW SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. THE SECOND B. C. P. RESULTS FROM A BILL THAT WILL -- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT ST TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN AND THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR REQUEST A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE DPR FUND ANNUALLY. FOR TWO YEARS TO IMPLEMENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRES DPR TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AFFECT. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFICACY OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT. AND I KNOW -- CHAIRMAN BLAMED YOU WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE ADDRESSING THE DEFICIT -- OR WHAT LOOKS LIKE -- A DECLINING INCOME IN OUR BUDGET FIND AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT OR TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS THE VERY SPECIFICALLY IF WE KNOW THAT THE THE RESERVE. WENT FROM FOURTEEN MILLION. TO SEVEN TWO THREE FROM. SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN IS THERE SOMETHING PLANNED IT. TO TO TAKE CARE THAT STRUCTURAL PROBLEM DO YOU. GOOD MORNING THE JULIANNA MOORE IS A ME WITH FINANCE SO AT THE TIME OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAD SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE USING THE FUND AS WELL AS DPR. DEBT HADN'T CLOSE THEIR BOOKS YET. SO WHAT YOU SEE WHAT YOU SAW ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR BASED ON ESTIMATES. AND IT DID NOT INCLUDE ANY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN SINCE THEN WE'VE UPDATED THE THE FUND CONDITION AND FOR MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WE SHARE THAT WITH THE CONSULTANTS. EARLIER IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY BECAUSE WE JUST GOT THE INFORMATION PUT THROUGH SO WE HAVE SO THERE WAS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COP OKAY I CAN. YES SO ARE YOU CAN YOU GIVE US THE NUMBERS IN IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAVE A PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT OF EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION. AND SO THEN THE FUND AT THE END OF NINETEEN TWENTY THE BALANCE IS ACTUALLY TEN PUT LITTLE OVER IT'S ALMOST TEN POINT SIX MILLION. SO WHETHER STILL IS A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE WITH THE EXPENDITURES EXCEEDING THE REVENUES. WE HAVE SOME TIME TO SEE HOW THE MAIL MIL TAX AND EVERYTHING WORKS OUT IT'S WITHIN A 5% -- TOLERANCE LEVEL [inaudible] AND JUST. TO GIVE YOU SOME SOME CONTEXT ON THAT LARGE IT SEEMS LIKE A LARGE -- PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT THAT'S BASED ON TWO YEARS. AND BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF OKAY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BECAUSE IT IT STARTED BOGGLING MY MIND. THE WAIT THE THE MILL TAX WHERE MIL FEE IS CALCULATED. IS NOT BASED ON A CALENDAR A YEAR SO IT'S IT HAS A MARCH CUT OFF DATE. SO TRYING. TO COORDINATE THAT AND ROLL OVER INTO THE NEW FISCAL SYSTEM IT WAS A TIMING ISSUE. CAN YOU GIVE ME THE UPDATED NUMBERS THEN YOU SAY FLOW. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE'S AN ADJUSTMENT OF EIGHT POINT NINE SO RIGHT SORT OF THE NEW NUMBER SO THAT GIVES -- A RESERVE OF TWENTY POINT SEVEN MILLION. TWENTY TWENTY POINT. SEVEN AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE A THIRTEEN POINT ROUGHLY THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN MILLION. AND THEN NINETEEN TWENTY IS TEN POINT SIX CORRECT. SO WE LOST ABOUT TEN MILLION IN THE TWO YEAR PERIOD AND PART OF THIS TOO IS DANIEL SEE THIS IN OTHER BUDGETS AS WELL WHEN WE HAVE THE THE PENSION PREPAYMENT. THIS IS THIS IS PAYING BACK THAT. SO IT'S HITTING ALL OF THE SPECIAL FUNDS -- OFF ALL FUNDS ALL THE WAY AROUND ACTUALLY HOW OFTEN DOES THE DEPARTMENT FORECAST FUTURE REVENUES AND HOW MANY YEARS AHEAD. DOESN'T DEPARTMENTS PROJECT. WE HAD -- LESLIE YOU MAY WANT TO COMMIT TO THAT ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT. I THINK WE PROJECT AT LEAST TWO YEARS OUT AND MAYBE -- THREE WESLEY CAN ADDRESS THAT FOR SURE. HI LESLIE FORD -- I'M THE FISCAL OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT -- GENERALLY REYES WE FORECAST A FIVE YEAR FUND CONDITION. SEE FORECAST FIVE YEARS OUT. AND WHEN YOU FORECAST TO FIVE YEARS OUT DID YOU HAVE AN IDEA THAT YOU WERE TWO YEARS BEHIND ON THIS ALL MALE OR THE MILL TAX. CALCULATION IT'S IT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND. AND ALMOST NINE MILLION ADJUSTMENT. THERE WOULD BE FROM TWO YEARS PRIOR. SO HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- WAS WHAT OCCURRED WAS WHAT -- JULIE ON I HAD SPOKEN TO IS THAT WHEN WE TRANSFERRED OVER FROM -- THAT CAL STAR SYSTEM THE ACCOUNTING SO. THAT'S WHERE IT APPEARED IN THE TRANSITION SO THE WAY WE REVENUES WERE RECORDED IN ONE SYSTEM WAS DIFFERENT AND IN THE FISCAL SYSTEMS. WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION BACK TO THE PATENT. THAT'S A LARGE ADJUSTMENT. BUT THEN FROM THERE. THERE WAS A SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND IT CONTINUES. SO THERE'S CLEARLY A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT. HOW IS HOW ARE YOU PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE SO THAT YOU DON'T END UP IN THE RENT? SO WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING THE FUND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WE HAVE BEEN PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE AND MAKING SURE THAT -- WE ARE -- MONITORING THE MAIL. I'M SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING BESIDES MONITORING WHAT IS BEING DONE SPECIFICALLY. BECAUSE MONITORING. STILL GIVES US FROM TWENTY DOWN TO THIRTEEN DOWN TO TEN AND WE'RE GOING IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL. AND IN JUST A FEW YEARS I THOUGHT IS GOING TO BE IN ONE YEAR BUT NOW WITH TEN POINT SIX IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER. BUT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE HEADING TO THE RED. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PLAN TO NOT JUST MONITOR BUT TO PLAN TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T END UP IN THE REST? AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT IS CONCERNING WHEN YOU LOOK WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT BUT I THINK THE MYUNDERSTANDING IS BEEN NOT BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT NOW FOR THREE ALMOST THREE YEARS. MY UNDERSTANDING HAS BEEN THAT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR US TO RUN AT THIS TYPE OF STRUCTURAL -- DEFICIENCY IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE THE BALANCE GOING DOWN -- WE HAVE WE THINGS THAT WE DO IN OUR OFFICE IS PLAN YEARS AHEAD STRATEGICALLY. AND WE LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF PROGRAMS WE CAN OFFER AND WHAT TYPE OF THAT MONEY WE MAY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS IN THE OFFICE -- WE WILL BE MONITORING THAT VERY CLOSELY THE SPENDING OF THOSE TYPES OF ODD -- MATTERS THAT BASICALLY WE LIKE TO HAVE THAT ARE NOT NECESSARY TO THE CORE OPERATIONS OF THE PROGRAM SO THAT WILL WORK WILL BE HAVE TO WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT VERY CLOSELY AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T RUN INTO PROBLEMS. WHO IS IT IN THE DEPARTMENT THAT WOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS? AND WOOD SOUNDS OF THE ALARM SAYING THIS DOES NOT LOOK GOOD WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE NUMBERS BEFORE GOING FROM. FOURTEEN TO SEVEN TO THREE TO FOUR AND NOW IT'S TWENTY TWO THIRTEEN TO SIX THERE IS A THAT THE IT'S AND WE'RE NOT HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THE NUMBERS THAT YOU SAW BEFORE WAS ACTUALLY NOT OUR DPR FUND THOSE NUMBERS WERE OUR OUR REGULAR RAZOR. WHEN I WAS AROUND REGISTRATION FIND AND SO IT DIDN'T COVER ALL OF OUR FUNDS ACTUALLY SO THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THERE -- BUT WE HAVE OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR PHYSICAL CHIEF WHO'S HERE WE HAVE AT THE DIRECTOR WHENEVER THE NEW DIRECTORS NINE WILL CERTAINLY BE LOOKING AT THE FIND I LOOK AT THE FINE I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR NORMALLY AND I LOOK AT THE FUND -- WE HAVE WE WATCH THE BUDGET FUND CLOSELY -- WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS ON THE SPENDING THE AND I PERHAPS I'M ASKING THE RIGHT WRONG QUESTION. BESIDES MONITORING WHAT IS BEING DONE TO PLAN. BECAUSE WE'RE HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THAT IS MY QUESTION NOT JUST THE MONITORING BECAUSE I'M SURE YOU SAW THE NUMBERS AND YOU CAN MONITOR AND SEE THAT IT'S GOING DOWN. WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS BEING DONE TO PLAN SO THAT THE NUMBERS DON'T GO DOWN BUT RATHER GO UP OR REMAIN STABLE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE? SUCH A STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE. WE WE REVIEW OUR FEES -- ON A REGULAR BASIS -- AT THIS POINT WE DO NOT INTEND TO INCREASE THE FEES BUT THAT'S AN OPTION SHOULD WE NEED TO DO THAT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TO BE ABLE TO CURB THE SPENDING IN THE DEPARTMENT -- AND NOT HAVE TO LOOK AT THE ADJUSTMENT OF THOSE FEES BUT CERTAINLY THAT IS ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY OUR REGISTRATION FEES -- ARE ADJUSTED TO SUPPORT OUR REGISTRATION PROGRAM SO EVEN THOUGH IT ALL GOES IN OUR DEEP YOUR FUN WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE COST TO THE REGISTRATION PROGRAM IS. AND WHAT WE HAVE MANY WHAT THE FEE AMOUNT IS WE'RE GETTING IN ON THAT PROGRAM -- OUR MILL ASSESSMENT -- HAS HAS BEEN -- THAT'S FORCE 80% OF OUR BUDGET -- WE ARE NOW AT THE MAX ON THE MILLS HAS SPENT TWO POINT ONE SANTA -- A ON EVERY DOLLAR SOLD BUT THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN WE COULDN'T COME BACK TO TRY TO RISE THAT SHOULD BECOME NECESSARY ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAVE OF COURSE IS MOVING FORWARD WITH PROGRAMS TO INSTITUTE SAFER ALTERNATIVES AND INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT MEASURES. SO AT SOME POINT IT MIGHT BECOME NECESSARY FOR US TO COME BACK AND LOOK AT THE MILL ASSESSMENT. VERY GOOD IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE YOU SAY THAT IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE THE NUMBERS GO DOWN. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR ME. MAYBE GOING BACK TEN YEARS IT'S SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND I RECOGNIZE THAT IT WILL BE. CALCULATED DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE THE OF THE PERIOD -- THAT YOU IT'S NOW BEEN CHANGED -- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT IF I MAY CERTAINLY TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF THIS BECAUSE THIS IS ALARMING TO ME. I UNDERSTAND WE WILL CERTAINLY PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT. THANK YOU WELL IT'S A LIME ALARMING TO THE CHAIRS WELL THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THE ISSUE UP IN THE FIRST PLACE AND ASK YOU TO ADDRESS THAT AND WHILE THE SITUATION MIGHT BE NOT BE DIRE IN THE IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM -- THE AT THE ACCOUNT APPEARS TO GO READ -- IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME I THINK IT'S TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS PROBABLY RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. IN TERMS OF A PLANNING HORIZON AND THE QUESTION -- THAT'S BEING POSED IS WHAT'S THE PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT THEIR FRANKLY APPEARS TO BE NO PLAN RIGHT NOW OTHER THAN TO WATCH IT -- WHEN ASKED -- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THE PLAN IS THE RESPONSE WAS WELL WE COULD -- REYES FEES OR WE COULD CUT COSTS THE FACT YOU KNOW TO SORT OF GETTING TO THE HEART OF WHAT YOU SAID BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT A PLAN. THE THOSE ARE THE TWO OPTIONS THAT THAT -- THAT YOU HAVE A AND THAT ANY DEPARTMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- A IN ANY GIVEN SITUATION WHEN THERE'S GOING TO BE A A SHORTFALL SO -- WE'RE GONNA HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND REQUEST THAT YOU COME BACK WITH THE PLAN AHEAD OF OUR NEXT HEARING SO THAT THERE'S AMPLE TIME TO REVIEW IT I'M -- A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATED THAT THIS YESTERDAY AFTER HAVING INQUIRED ABOUT THAT ABOUT IT -- SO. YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE A LITTLE BIT MORE LEAD TIME IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THESE THINGS AND AND TO I WOULD LIKE THE LA -- TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION TO SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE US WITH THEIR BEST ADVICE ON ISSUES LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE UP BY THE WAY THIS IS -- I THINK IT TO BECOME A RECURRENT THEME -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE ACCOUNTS THAT APPEAR TO BE GOING INTO THE RED AWARE THERE'S BEEN BORROWING AND MOVING MONEY AROUND. AND IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF AND PROVIDE SOME -- HOPEFULLY SOME OVERSIGHT AND AND SEE SOME SOLUTIONS ON OUT DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YES SUMMER WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FIRST OF ALL. WE WERE RAISING ANY ISSUES WITH IT THE TWO PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU HOWEVER WITH REGARDS TO THAT DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION FINE THIS WAS ON A LIST OF FUNDS THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT BECAUSE WE'VE NOTED THAT THE TRAJECTORY. OF THE RESERVISTS GOING DOWNWARD WE WERE VERY CONCERNED THAT WE WERE GOING TO RUN INTO ANY STRUCTURAL IMBALANCE VERY SOON HOWEVER YESTERDAY WE RECEIVED UPDATED FUND CONDITION STATEMENTS. WE'VE ALREADY GONE OVER THE NUMBERS -- THAT'S FINDING A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM NONE THE LESS THE PROBLEM STILL EXCESS AND BECAUSE WE ONLY RECEIVED AS UPDATED FUND CONDITION STATEMENTS YESTERDAY WE HAVEN'T REALLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY DIVE INTO THEM YET. AND SEE IF WE CAN IDENTIFY SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES SOME POTENTIAL OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF TO IDENTIFY THOSE OPTIONS. THANK YOU YES TO TO ONE ANOTHER COMMUNIST CHAIRMAN. I APOLOGIZE I WANTED TO CORRECT MY MY EARLIER STATEMENT. ACCORDING -- ASSUMING THAT THE REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES ARE FLAT IN THE OUT YEARS.

INSTEAD OF CLEANING UP TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PROPERTIES BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO CLEAN THAT.

THIS IS A LOAN FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND AUGMENTS THE ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT SIX MILLION LOAN AUTHORIZED IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE INCREASE COSTS COVERED BY THIS LOAN ARE DUE TO UNKNOWN FACTORS ABOUT THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE CONTAMINATION. IN THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING EXCITED AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS.

AND TO MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO CLEAN UP THE MOST CONTAMINATED PROPERTIES IN THESE COMMUNITIES WE WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU QUESTION. SIX GARCIA YES -- LET ME START OFF WITH THEM. COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THE AT THE FROM. THE TSC -- THOUGH THE WORK ON ACT THAT STARTED LONG BEFORE I GOT TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN WE GOT TO THE LEXUS BUT SLATER. ANALYST OKAY AND HAPPENED THERE WAS THE STARK CONTRAST WITH HOW WE WERE HANDLING THE SITUATIONS. AND IT WAS IN A WITHIN A COINCIDENCE OF WHO LIVES WHERE AND HOW WE WERE HANDING THE SITUATIONS. AT THAT POINT THE GOVERNOR HAS PROPOSED ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS TOYS ALL OF THE TNC BUDGET THAT WOULD HAVE INCLUDED ALL THE WORK IN A TO DO AN EXCITED. EVERYTHING ELSE AND I SAID THAT IT WAS INSULTING BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME BROWN I WAS THROWING PENNIES AT BROWN PEOPLE. ON AND AFTER THAT. ACTION CHANGING WE GOT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX UNKNOWN WE WERE TOLD THAT THAT WAS THE ONLY MONEY THAT WAS GOING TO COME OUR WAY. BUT WE WERE TOLD EVERY TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP AND THAT THAT COST COULD BE CLOSE TO A BILLION DOLLARS. I COMMUNITY SAID THAT WE WERE GOING TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LEAVE ANYONE. SEWER TACIT FINDING. CREATIVE WAY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND HIS AT THAT POINT WE TOOK ON THE CHALLENGE TO PASS THE FIRST TWO THIRDS VOTE FEE IN A DECADE. TO CREATE THE BATTERY FEE FUND. AND THANKFULLY WITH THE HELP OF STAFF HERE STAFF AND THE COMMITTEE CENTER COLLEAGUES WE GOT THAT PASSED. AND THEY GAVE US A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE OR GOING ANY OTHER THOUGHT THAT HOPEFULLY WERE CREATING A MODEL. FOR ALL THE OTHER TOXIC THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COMMUNITY JUST LIKE LOTS OF OTHER COMMUNITY THE COLORS THEY'RE COSTLY BEING TO THE LIKELY SIGN THIS IS ONE OF MANY THINGS. AND THAT PROCESS IS ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST FOURTEEN OTHER LEGACY SITES IN THE SITE. AND IN THE STATE THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP -- TIED TO LEAD BATTERIES A LOT OF THE NEAR THE THING COMMUNITY THERE. AND SO WE REALIZED THAT IT pDOLLARS TO THE TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT WE NEEDED TO BE WORKING ON BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THESE LEGACY SITES WORKING THE ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BATTERY FEED GAVE US THEY GAVE US HOPE AND A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE ANYONE BEHIND NOW THAT WE WERE IN OVER. THE RIGHT PATH [inaudible] UNFORTUNATELY [inaudible] OUR COMMUNITY. FEELS LIKE WE'RE BEING ASSAULTED WE FEEL LIKE OUR WORK IS BEING PROSTITUTED. IN THOSE HARSH TERMS BECAUSE WE HAVE TAKEN TO BORROW FROM THIS -- FEE FOR OTHER PROJECTS ARE TO KEEP THE TSC UP THOUGH WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW WE HAVE DEPARTMENTS GOING INTO THE RED WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT THE TSC. AND WOMEN PLAYING GAMES WITH THE BATTERY FEE FIND LAST YEAR AND AGAIN THIS YEAR AND THERE'S A SENSE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE GIVING US. ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LOANS OVER TWO YEARS WE REALLY YOU'RE NOT WHEN YOU'RE TAKING SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR FROM A FUND IN CREATING A HABIT THE MIXES WORRY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO THEN CREATE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. WITHIN THE HARD WORK OF OUR OUR BATTERY FEET OUT THERE WE LOOKED AT THIS EVEN CLOSER YESTERDAY'S WERE TRANSFER OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WAYS TO SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IS ANOTHER ONE TIME LOAN. OR IS THAT CONTINUES APPROPRIATION WE SAW THAT AT SOME POINT. BECAUSE OF THE BATTERY FEE FUN WAS TOSCA ANOTHER FUN WE KNOW THAT'S GONNA BE INSOLVENT IN ANOTHER TEN YEARS. SO HE SHOULDN'T SHIFTING MONEY AROUND AND WHEN YOU DO THIS AND I GO BACK HOME AND THE COMMUNITY ACTIVIST RIGHTFULLY SO FILL THEY CONTINUE TO TELL US THAT THESE BROWN PEOPLE DON'T MATTER. THAT WE'RE GONNA PRETEND WE'RE HELPING YOU AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE THESE VICTORY LAPS AND GET THESE HEADLINES BUT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO LEAVE THIS BEHIND A COUPLE OF YEARS. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN HARD IT HAS IT IT'S BEEN HARD FOR THE TNC WERE LEARNING ALONG THE WAY -- WE NEVER EXPECTED TO BE PERFECT BUT WHEN WE SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PAYING THESE GAMES H. AS ADDS TO OUR DISTRUST. IT CONTINUES TO MAKE US FEEL LIKE YOU'RE THROWING PENNIES AT BROWN PEOPLE YOU CHALLENGES TO PASS A FEE A TWO THIRDS FEE THAT HAD TO MEAN THAT IN THE DECADE. PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE WERE CRAZY PARTICULAR TASK ON WE DID AND THEY CONTINUE TO PILLAGE OF FIND. AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO NOT JUST KEEP THIS OPEN BUT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO RESPECT WHAT WE'VE TOLD THE WHAT WE TOLD MY COLLEAGUES INCLUDING MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THAT WAS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE SINCE WHETHER THINGS. AND SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CONTINUE TO PLAY THESE GAMES AND IS YOU COULD HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING THIS WHY WE'RE PAYING BACK. A GENERAL LOAN AND THEN YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE GIVING GIVING ME ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LOAN. JUST ON THE MANY MORE LOANS USED THE MONEY AND THE FEET AND THE BATTERY FEE TO CLEAN UP EXCITE. AND SO I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SO YOU'RE FINALLY MONEY AROUND YOUR LAUNDRY MONEY AROUND. TO KEEP THE DEPARTMENT OF FLOW THAT WE KNOW IS STRUCTURE IN A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN ITS REALLY INSULTING TO MY COMMUNITY OUT THERE. AND SO I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION OF WHY THIS IS OKAY WHY WE CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION I TOOK OF LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET THAT I'M NOT GONNA TAKE AGAIN THIS YEAR. AND SO PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND A LOT. IF YOU'D LIKE TO RESPOND. THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS WE HAD PROPOSED THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF THE THE LEAD ACID BATTERY. FUND CANNOT SUPPORT. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S NECESSARY AND WE WANTED TO XCELERATED. BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND THE RISKS. THERE'S THE YOU ARE TAKING FORTY OR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM A FINE YOU IN THE IN TWO YEARS. TO DO WORK THAT COULD BE THERE IF YEAH I CAN'T SUPPORT IT IF WE COULD TAKE IN OUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE. AND AND WHY NOT GIVE US THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND USE WITHIN ABOUT A REFUND CHECKS ALREADY BEEN MORE IT'S NOT JUST THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED HOMES WE HAVE TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP. SO GIVE ME THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ALSO USE THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTEEN TO NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS PROJECTED ENOUGH FUN. TO TO TO GIVE ME EXTRA MONEY OR LET'S GO AHEAD AND INCREASE THE FONT LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO ONE OF OUR BILLS. BUT INSTEAD WERE PLAIN MONIES WERE WERE SHIFTING DOLLARS AROUND TO HIDE UPON THAT WE HAVE A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AT THE TSC. IS THAT CORRECT. THE UN STATEMENT SAID THAT MS GARCIA JUST MADE IS THAT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT ACCOUNT. AS A PONG GAME. NO I WOULDN'T I WOULDN'T KNOW IS IT BEING IS IS THE MONEY IN THE FUND BEING USED. TO SHORE UP DTS SEES OVERALL FUNDING. A DEFICIT NOW [inaudible] NO. THE THE THE WIRE WHERE WE BORROWING MONEY OUT OF THAT ACCOUNT. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THE BORROWING IS THE THE LOAN. OKAY SORRY. THE LOAN FROM THE LEAD ACID BATTERY IS SUPPORTING. ACTIVITIES RELATED TO EXCITE. WIRE WIRE WE NEEDING TO PAY THAT LOAN BACK RIGHT NOW AND WHEN YOU'RE THAN SAYING I'M GONNA LONELY ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THAT YOU'RE TAKING MONEY OUT OF A BATTERY FEE. AND THEN SAY NEIL ANY EXTRA MONEY. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THERE'S NO NEED TO PAY THAT MONEY NOW YOU COULD TAKE WITH IN THEIR AND ACCELERATE THE CLEAN UP EVEN MORE. HAVE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP EVEN QUICKER START WORKING ON THE OTHER LEGACY SITES. THERE'S NO NEED TO WAIT ROOM COULD START DEVELOPING OF CLASS AS WELL. SO MY NAME IS SUPER TELLING THE DETAILS SEE I'M A PROJECT MANAGER FOR EXCITED AND WHAT I CAN I CAN ACT TO THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT THE FIFTY MILLION THAT IS BEING PROPOSED A TOP ABOUT. IS GOING TO HELP US TAKE CHARGE OF THE MOMENTUM THAT WE ARE BUILDING TO CLEAN UP PROPERTY SO WE ARE GOING TO INCREASE. I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT GIVE THE THEIR ADDITIONAL I CAN'T TALK ABOUT LOVE RICK FUNDS -- WE HAVE BORROWED A FUNDS TO AS A GUARANTEE FOR OF OF OF ACTIVITIES WHERE WE ARE OVERSEEING CLOSURE OF EXIDE THE MONEY IS TO BE PAID BY EXCITE. WE ARE USING THAT FUNDED TO GUARANTEE THAT -- IT THAT'S THE ONLY. A ITEM THAT I KNOW WHERE BE A BARRING. THAT AS A GUARANTEE FUND. AND ON THE BRICK SITES ALTHOUGH I DON'T WORK ON IT I KNOW THAT WE ARE INVESTIGATING -- THERE IS ACTUALLY SAMPLING HAPPENING IN A BURKE METALS WHICH IS ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE PROJECT -- AND THERE ARE TWO OTHER -- SITES THAT ARE ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED SO THERE IS WORK BEING DONE BUT I WILL TAKE THE ADDITIONAL MONEY. AND AND I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT WE ARE. USING THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU HAVE -- ENSURE THAT TO CLEAN UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CRUISE THAT WE HAVE IN THE FIELD -- AND TO YOU KNOW TO WORK WITH THE RESIDENTS TO GET THOSE CLEAN UP SCHEDULED -- WE HAVE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SPECIALISTS -- ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT ZONES IN THE PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN BE DOING THAT OUT REACHING GETTING THE ACCESS AGREEMENTS TO HAVE THE THE RESIDENCES IN THE QUEUE TO BE READY WHEN THE CONTRACTORS ARE READY TO GO -- AND TRAINING UNDER THE WORKS PROGRAM RIGHT TRAINING LOCAL -- YOUTH AND WE ARE EMPLOYING THEM -- THERE'S THIS THERE'S A FOURTH COURT THAT IS GOING TO START FOR THE TRAINING BECAUSE THE DEMAND FOR THE LABOR IS THERE -- AND WITH THIS FUNDING WE CAN MAXIMIZE ALL OF THAT. YOU CAN MAXIMIZE THE AM I CORRECT THE TO MAXIMIZE THAT EVEN MORE AB HAVE TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PLUS WITHIN THE BATTERY FEE FUND. ABSOLUTELY AND SO THERE'S NO REASON. TO BE PAYING BACK A GENERAL FUND ON RIGHT NOW ONE TIME MONIES -- WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE HOMES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP IN THIS COMMUNITY [inaudible] MS REST. FIRST I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA. IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS THE THEN THE KNOWLEDGE. ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT SHE DOES TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY HAVE A CHAMPION THE WAY THAT SHE HAS BEEN. ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S SO EASY TO GO ALSO OVER ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE PRESENTED TO US BECAUSE THEY ARE. PIECE MEAL. SO I SINCERELY APPRECIATE I WANT TO SAY THAT PUBLICLY BECAUSE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT IS MOST AFFECTED BY THIS -- THERE ARE FEW THINGS IN THE THAT IS THEIR QUESTIONS IF I MAY -- MISTER CHAIR THAT I WOULD LIKE SPECIFIC ANSWERS ON WHEN DOES THE TSC ANTICIPATED WILL COMPLETE THE SAMPLING OF THE TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE PARCELS WITHIN THE P. I. A AND THE CLEAN UP OF PARCELS CONTAMINATED BY LET. SO THERE IS TEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PARCELS -- IN THE P. I. A. AS YOU ARE SAID -- SAMPLED AS OF MARCH FIFTEENTH. THE REMAINS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARE -- REMAIN OPEN -- THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SPECIALISTS THAT -- FOR JUST CONNECT WE WAS TALKING ABOUT -- THESE. ALL OF THESE TEN THOUSAND PLUS PARCELS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED ON BY OUR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES ON AN AVERAGE. THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARE GOING TO COME INTO THE FOLD. ONLY IF -- THEIR NAME OWNERSHIP CHANGES THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE EITHER FLAT OUT TOLD US. DON'T KNOCK DON'T COME HERE OR ARE NOT INTERESTED IN ANY OF THE OUTREACH WE ARE GEARING TOWARDS THEM WE ARE SEEING SOME TRICKLES WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE THAT WALK BY SEE SOMEBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD GETTING CLEANED UP AND SAY. ASK ABOUT IT AND ARE GETTING SAMPLE BUT THE SAMPLING NUMBERS ARE DWINDLING -- BUT WE DO HAVE A SAMPLING CONTRACTOR HANG ON HAND AND IF ANYBODY COMES TO US AS LONG AS WE ARE WORKING IN THIS PROJECT AREA WE WILL SAMPLE THEM. SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY TWO OF OUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED OR SO PROPERTIES MAY OR MAY NOT. COME INTO THE FOLD -- BUT AS LONG AS WE ARE IN THE FIELD IN DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THOSE SAMPLING. SO THEY NEVER COME INTO THE FOLD WHEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT YOU WILL COMPLETE THE SAMPLING. SO IF THEY NEVER COME INTO THE FOLD WE WILL WE WILL JUST -- LEAVE IT AT THAT NUMBER WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS WE ME MAY REACHED EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED WE MAY REACH -- NINE THOUSAND BUT OUR EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE FEW PEOPLE THAT DO NOT WANT TO PARTAKE. BUT THAT NUMBER CAN CHANGE AS PROPERTY OWNERSHIP CHANGES AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR OUTREACH REACH OUT TO THESE BEYOND WHAT WE'VE DONE THUS FAR. CAN I ADD ON THAT I MEAN I AND IN ALL FAIRNESS I KNOW THE TSC AND COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD TO BRING EVERYONE INTO THE FOLD -- AND CONTINUES TO WORK TO DO THAT INTO THE FALL UNTIL I HAVE A LOT OFDECISIONS I WANT TO BE FOR AND THAT IS THE SPACE WHERE THE TSC HAS BEEN WORKING AGGRESSIVELY. TO TRY TO CONVINCE EVERYONE AND ALL THE PROPERTY OWNERS CONTINUOUSLY TO COME INTO THE FOLD. THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DOES DTS YET. HOW MUCH DOES THE TSC ESTIMATE IT WILL COST TO COMPLETE THE SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP OF ALL OF THE PARCELS THE REQUIRED CLEAN UP WITHIN THE PIAA? AND SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE EXPECT TO SEE IT TIME GENERAL FUND LOANS IN FUTURE BUDGETS -- SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER -- OR I'M I'M NOT SURE I DID I WAS AT A COMMUNITY MEETING LAST NIGHT SO I'M MIXING UP MESSAGES PERHAPS BUT SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY NINE PARCELS HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AS OF MARCH FIFTEENTH -- WE ARE WE ARE. TARGETING A ANTICIPATING CLEANING UP UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PARCELS BY DECEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY AND THE CAP YACHTS THAT -- CHIEF OF A **** HE SAID. WHETHER AND PEOPLE PERMITTING -- IF NOTHING HAPPENS THAT THAT IS THE GOAL THAT IS WHERE WE ARE GOING. THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS HAVE GONE UP THE INFLATION THE COST OF LABOR THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES THAT WE BASED THE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. LOAN ON WAS -- WAS BASED ON CONSTRUCTION COSTS THAT WERE OF FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN LATE. FOURTEEN ARE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND OUR THAT. CLEAN UP WAS CONDUCTED BY EXCITE CONTRACT -- CONTRACTING -- ORGANIZATION HAS DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTING THEN EXCITE DOES ARE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS HAS ADDED SOME COST WE HAVE BONDING REQUIREMENTS. OF WE HAVE -- PREVAILING WAGES THAT WERE ALL KNOCKED OUT IN THAT ORIGINAL COST -- AND SO THAT HAS ALL ADDED UP AT AS OF TODAY. WE BELIEVE THIS THAT THAT THE AVERAGE PROPERTIES GOING TO COST SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS AN AVERAGE BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR THESE NUMBERS DO CHANGE BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY IS DIFFERENT. THE SOMETIMES THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PROPERTY IS SUCH THAT IT IS ON A HILLSIDE WHERE WE CANNOT USE EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO USE MANUAL LABOR THE COST GOES UP. SOMETIMES THERE IS THE LAY OUT OF THE PROPERTIES SUCH THAT THE EQUIPMENT CANNOT PASS BETWEEN THE STRUCTURES AND WE HAVE TO USE MANUAL LABOR AND THE COST GOES UP. SO THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT THAT. AFFECT THE AVERAGE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE BASING ON AND YES THERE IS A THERE IS AS I SAID -- EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED PLUS PROPERTY SAMPLED WE HAVE A ABOUT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED THAT'LL REMAIN AND THERE WILL NOT GET CLEANED UP EVEN AFTER THE AUGMENTATION OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT WE'LL NEED A FUNDING. SO. SO THAT I CAN WRITE IN MY NOTES. WHAT IS THE ESTIMATE FOR DETAILS SEE? NOW TO COMPLETE THE SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP. SO THIS IS THIS IS. MATH IS NOT MY FORTE BUT I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU DO SIXTY TIMES OF FORTY FOUR HUNDRED THAT IS WHAT IS AS OF TODAY. BUT BUT LIKE I SAID. BUT WE'LL SAY MATH IS NOT MY FORTE EITHER WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WHO CAN DO THIS MATH I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO PUT DOWN A NUMBER. AS TO WHAT THE ESTIMATE IS RIGHT NOW -- TO COMPLETE THE SAMPLING AND CLEAN UP OF ALL THE PARCELS. AS A MAY I ADD A A COMMON HERE PLEASE YOU DON'T MIND -- THIS IS A QUESTION THAT'S PRINTED IN THE AGENDA. AND SO IT REALLY BEHOOVES -- EVERYONE WHO APPEARS BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE TO BE PREPARED TO ANSWER WITH SOME LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY THAT THE THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED. THAT'S WHY OUR STAFF BECAUSE TO THE TROUBLE OF PUTTING THOSE QUESTIONS IN THERE -- ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES -- TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER JUST SAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER AND YOU KNOW WE EXPECT. THAT ANSWER TO BE PROVIDED -- NOT YOU KNOW AT THE TIME THE NEXT HEARING BUT IT WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE OF THE NEXT HEARING WILL THAT. YEAH HELP MISTRESS AND WE CAN CERTAINLY -- PROVIDE YOU WITH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AS OF TODAY'S DATE I THINK A THE CHALLENGE THAT SUITS HAVING IS THAT -- WE ASSUME WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE SAMPLING AGREEMENTS BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE OUT IN THE FIELD -- AND AND EVEN AS WERE CLEANING WE EXPECT SOME -- PROPERTY OWNERS TO TO SIGN UP FOR SAMPLING AS THE SEE THE THEIR NEIGHBORS PROPERTIES BEING REMEDIATED AND THEN WE WERE WERE A LITTLE TENTATIVE ON THE PRICE PER PROPERTY WE KNOW THAT THAT'S CHANGED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE OF INCREASED. INFLATION WITH CONSTRUCTION COSTS UNDER CROSS ALL CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY NOT JUST PERTAINING TO THIS AND IN THE OTHER AT ELEMENTS THAT NGUYEN IN THE UNKNOWNS WHICH ARE THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION. AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPERTIES TESTAMENT AND AND WE WOULD NEED TO QUALIFY IT WITH THOSE FACTORS THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE AGENDA ASKED FOR AND AN ESTIMATE -- AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT I'M SORRY -- TO TO INTERJECT HERE BUT THIS IS JUST A LITTLE BIT FRUSTRATING -- I'D. HEY AND THE ALL WE NLY EXPECT PROJECTION AND IF THERE'S A TOLERANCE THAT'S PLUS OR MINUS OF YOU KNOW CERTAIN PERCENTAGES JUST TELL US -- BUT NOT COMING IN WITH ANY INFORMATION AT ALL THIS -- OF FRANKLY A AN UNACCEPTABLE. AND I THINK THAT IF IF YOU GIVE ESTIMATES YOU CAN SAVE BASED UPON THIS NUMBER. AND THESE MANY PARCELS WITH THIS MANY OF THEM HAVING BEEN -- SAMPLED IT AND THEN YOU CAN QUALIFY IT BUT HONESTLY THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING. TO BE ABLE TO TO TO TO FEEL THAT WE CAN VOTE ON SOMETHING. FOR ME ANYWAY I'M THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK BUTTO TO ASK ME TO VOTE ON SOMETHING AND WHEN I HAVE MY COLLEAGUE WHO KNOWS THIS INSIDE AND OUT HAVING THIS LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION. IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO EVER VOTE. TO ON THIS KIND OF A BUDGET ITEM WITH NO ESTIMATES AND AS THE CHAIR HAS INDICATED THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS LISTED. ON READING THE QUESTION RIGHT FROM WHAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT I I AM. SO AS OF TODAY WHAT IS THE NUMBER. IT'S WE WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE HAVE WE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR HUNDRED ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES. THAT ARE -- HAVE BEEN SAMPLED BETTER BE TO THE CLEANUP THRESHOLD OF EIGHTY PARTS PER MILLION AND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PARTS PER MILLION WHICH IS -- WHAT THE ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION WILL WELL I'LL ENABLE US TO CLEAN TO AND WE'RE ESTIMATING THAT THOSE FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PROPERTIES WILL COST APPROXIMATELY SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PROPERTY TO CLEAN? IF I MAY INTERJECT DISAPPEAR THE SIMPLE MATH THAT'S TO OUR SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FONG. HANDY DANDY CALCULATORS. HOW DO YOU DISAPPOINT ME I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD THEN THAT -- CALCULATION HERE AT ALL RIGHT. OF THE THE NAME IS RACE I THINK THERE'S A TO OTHER QUESTIONS HERE THAT WE WANT TO GET -- TO AND AND WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER -- TO SIT TECHNICAL TERM CAN I MUCH OF OTHER QUESTIONS YES -- I I'D APPRECIATE THAT LET'S TRY TO GET ANSWERS TO THOSE OF THE ANSWERS ARE HERE TODAY -- THE SAME DIRECTION -- PLEASE GET THAT INFORMATION TO US PLEASE PROCEED ADDRESS. WHEN DOES THE TSC ESTIMATE EXIDE WILL BEGIN TO REPAY THE STATE FOR THE CLEAN UP COSTS IS IT HAS INCURRED AND HOW ARE THESE PAYMENTS LIKELY TO BE SCHEDULED OVER TIME? SO DETAILS HE IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO ENSURE THAT ALL NECESSARY STEPS ARE TAKEN -- TO HOLD EXCITE AND ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE THIS PROCESS IS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED -- AND THIS IS ALL I CAN TALK ABOUT HERE. BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OKAY. AND FINALLY WHAT A FORTY DOES DTS SEE HAVE TO ENSURE EXCITED WILL ULTIMATELY BEAR THE COSTS OF THE PLANE -- SO THERE'S THERE'S A COUPLE OF ITEMS I BUY A I WILL READ IT TO YOU DDS HE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO RECOVER ITS RESPONSE ACTIONS ARE AT THE CORRECTIVE ACTION AN OVERSIGHT COSTS. FOREST'S FROM RESPONSIBLE PARTIES UNDER SECTION NINE SIX ZERO SEVEN OF THE CIRCLE A WHICH IS THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE AND COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT -- AND SECTION TWENTY FIVE THREE SIXTY OF THE HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE ACCOUNT ACT -- THIS IS HEALTH AND SAFETY COAL -- TWENTY FIVE THREE SIXTY IN ADDITION DGSE HAS AUTHORITY OVER HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION -- TWO FIVE ONE EIGHT ZERO TO ENFORCE EXCITES OBLIGATION ACTIVE ACTIONS REQUIRED UNDER THE TWO THOUSAND TWO CORRECTIVE ACTION CONSENT ORDER AND THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STIPULATION AN ORDER AND IT'S AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING AN ANSWER FOR THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. WELCOME TO AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS LET ME JUST -- ASK COULD A A AND I'VE THE THE WHOLE VIOLATED THIS RULE OUT OF MYSELF IN THIS RECENT -- INTERCHANGE -- PLEASE ALL OF US HAS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND TO YOU KNOW RAISE YOUR HAND LET ME KNOW YOU WANT TO BE HEARD IN THAT. A LOT -- TECHNOLOGY YOU AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE MORE ORDERLY PROCEEDING AND WANT THINGS TO DEVOLVE OVER THE COMING MEETINGS -- AND I'D LIKE TO JUST KEEP WITH THE NORM OF OF THIS COMMITTEE -- MS GARCIA AND THEN LIST. I APOLOGIZE IF I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE BREAKING THE RULES TO AN ANAL BETTER I'M NOT AND YOU BE HERE. BUT ACTUALLY YOU KNOW WE WE DID SOME MATH EARLIER ABOUT THE COST -- AND IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN AVERAGE OF BETWEEN 600-002-80000 PRESS HOUSEHOLD. IF WE HAVE -- EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED HAVE BEEN SAMPLE ONLY NO NEED TO BE CLEANED UP WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CLEANUP OF X. HAD A LOAN ON INCLUDING THE OTHER LEGACY SITES. MATT THIS MY FORTE ACTUALLY IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LOVE -- AND I WANT TO SAY TWO THINGS IN THE IN THAT VEIN -- WE HAVE TAKEN AN A TEN MILLION WE HAVE TAKEN TEN MILLION FROM THE BATTERY FUND TO REPAY. A LOAN THAT WAS DONE ANOTHER SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN WE'RE PROPOSING ANOTHER SIXTEEN MILLION ACTUALLY ALMOST SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS CLOSE. TO FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WE ARE SAYING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE EXCITED ANOTHER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR LOANS AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE NOT WHEN THEY WE TAKE THE FORTY FOUR YEAR TAKING IN THE FIFTY IT'S ONLY. SIX BILLION DOLLARS OF ANYONE'S GOING TO TAKE A VICTORY LAP OR SAY GOOD JOB OR GIVING NEXT DAY WHERE MONEY IS BECAUSE BUT WE ARE GIVING IT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. NOT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF YOU FEEL THAT THE MONEY COMING INTO THE BATTERY FEE FUND IS NOT ENOUGH. THERE'S A MUCH BETTER SOLUTION THAN THIS THIS SHELL GAME THAT WE'RE PLAYING LET'S INCREASE THE BATTERY FEE FUND LET'S REMOVE THE FENCE AT THAT WE PUT IN THERE FOR SOME OF THOSE FEES -- THIS IS GONNA BE AN EXPENSIVE PROCESS EXCITE IS ONE OF FIFTEEN LEGACY SITES WE KNOW WE HAVE MORE WE DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO. GENERAL FUND LOANS WEEKLY THAT MY THIS BATTERY FEE FUND IT'S A FEW THAT WE PAY EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS AS A FEW THAT I HAD TO PAY LAST YEAR WAS EXCITING TO SEE MY HE OUT THERE AS A CONSUMER. I'M WILLING TO PAY THAT THE TO FIVE EVERY TWO TO FIVE YEARS EVEN EVER LISTEN MY FAULT TO MAKE SURE COMPLETED EASE THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES. AND HAVE BEEN TREATED LIKE ALWAYS I'M FOR GENERATIONS HAVE A BETTER FUTURE AND SO I WHICH IS RECOMMEND THAT WE DO. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MATH. AND WE THINK ABOUT THIS IN A SMARTER WAY SO THAT WE DO HAVE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS OUT THERE LEFT FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO DO. AND WE CREATE A MODEL OF HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THESE LEGACY THAT MAN MADE DISASTERS. OUT THERE AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING FALLS VICTORY LAPS AND WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH. YOU KNOW A HEADLINE I WILL SAY THAT THE IN THE DAY THE TSC IS OUT THERE WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY. THE CLEANUP IS PICKING UP THE MORE MONEY WE PUT IN THERE AT THE FASTER GETS UNDER THE FASTER WE CAN DO THE CLEAN UP. THE THE LEFT SICKNESS AND THE HELP YOU'RE COMMUNITIES ARE GONNA HAVE LONG TERM LET IS BAD AT ALL LEVELS. LET IS BAD FOR KIDS IT DOESN'T LET THEM THINK IT DOESN'T LET THEM GROW WE TALK ABOUT IT SHE MAY GAS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND OTHER COMMITTEES. THIS IS PART OF THE PROBLEM IN THIS IS ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE THIS IS THE REGENCY NOT JUST BECAUSE I GO HOME I LIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY AND I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND MY NEIGHBORS. BUT BECAUSE I KNOW I HAVE LOTS OF OTHER LEGACY ISSUES THAT I NEED TO FIGHT FOR AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS WILL BE A MODEL FOR US MOVING FORWARD FOR ALL THE OTHER THINGS HAVE TO DEAL WITH. CHROMIUM SIX ARSENIC WAY MY FRUSTRATION IS NOT JUST TO BEAT YOU UP MY FRUSTRATION IS ABSOLUTION IT'S LET'S IMPROVE ON THAT BETTER IF YOU FIND INSTEAD OF SAYING IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH HE TOSSES WITH PASSING A FEE. THAT THEY GET BETTER LET'S HONOR THE PROMISES THAT WE MADE TO OUR COLLEAGUES THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE READING THAT FUND FOR OTHER THINGS [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAN I MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE -- THE THE AS THE NUMBER THAT WAS PRESENTED EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED THAT HAVE BEEN SAMPLED NOT ALL EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED AND NEED TO CLEAN UP -- BUT THERE'S THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED THAT ARE REQUIRED CLEAN UP -- AND A BUT THERE ARE SIXTEEN HUNDRED THAT WE HAVEN'T SAMPLED SO I I'M GOING WITH HER MATH BUT I WANTED -- TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT AS OF TODAY WE HAVE SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED PARCELS THAT DO REQUIRE CLEAN UP -- WE WILL CLEAN UP UP TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND THERE IS FORTY FOUR HUNDRED THAT REMAIN. THANK YOU -- WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY LARGE SCALE -- JOB IT'S COMPLICATED THE FUNDING FOR IT IS AS AS COMPLICATED BUT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. THE THE FUNDING AND TO SEE TO IT THAT DAY -- PROPER -- LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT IS APPLIED TO WE CAN'T DO THAT IF WE YOU KNOW HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THE OF THE INFORMATION SO -- LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY MEMBERS THE PUBLIC WANT TO BE HERE HEARD ON THIS ITEM -- WE DO HAVE A HOLD UP IN -- WHAT WE HAVE A -- APPROVED RECOMMENDATION BUT I'M GOING TO ASK THAT WE HOLD THE SITE NOW THE GOOD MORNING ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS CHARLENE CONTRAST AND I'M WITH A LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF ANGELO PALOMA OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH PROTECTION. WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR INCLUDING THE PROPOSED BUDGET. IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS CLEANING UP RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES SURROUNDING THE FORMER EXCITE FACILITY. WE ARE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. ACCORDING TO MATH IN THE ROOM THE ESTIMATED COST TO CLEAN UP THIS CONTAMINATION IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IS ANOTHER KEY STEP IN ASSURING A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAM. IS AVAILABLE UNTIL CONTAMINATION IN THE LAST HOME IS REMOVED. WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NEW AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP AND ARE ENCOURAGED WITH THEIR DESIRE TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COUNTY. AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS IN ADDRESSING THE LONGSTANDING PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE X. I. CLEAN UP. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THIS COLLABORATION AND STAND READY TO ASSIST THE AGENCY AND THE LEGISLATURE IN ACHIEVING THIS GOAL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO THAT CONCLUDES SAID -- THIS ITEM THANK YOU VERY MUCH PRESENTATION AND FOR ANSWERING PCA A LOT OF TOUGH QUESTIONS -- WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO OF RESOURCES RECYCLING IN RECOVERY HOW CAL RECYCLE WE HAVE -- ISSUES EIGHT NINE AND TEN AND WELCOME A MISTER SMITH KLINE -- WOULD WOULD YOU KNOW -- WE'VE -- WE'VE GOT A PACKED AGENDA -- TODAY AND AND WE'VE ALREADY SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ON SOME COMPLICATED ISSUES -- SO I'M A LITTLE BIT HESITANT -- TO STEP IN BACK INTO THE QUAGMIRE OF THE BOTTLE BILL -- BUT IT IT DOES SEEM -- BASED ON EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN REPORTED TO ME THAT -- RECYCLING SITUATION IS GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE -- THE LAST TIME WE HEARD FROM -- FROM THE DEPARTMENT I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY THAT IS HAPPENING BUT IN JANUARY YOUR DEPARTMENT REPORTED THAT -- APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED CYCLING CENTERS HAVE BEEN CLOSED -- OVER THE LAST YEAR WHICH BRINGS THAT THE TOTAL OF CLOSE RECYCLING CENTERS TO ABOUT A THOUSAND AND THE RECYCLING RATE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEEMS TO HAVE DROPPED BELOW 75% WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL IN A DECADE AND I YOU KNOW I'VE KIND OF REPEATED AS MANTRA DILLON. BLUE IN THE FACE -- THAT IF THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT RESTORED RECYCLING IS THIS THING THAT IS SORT OF EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS -- WITHIN A REALLY GOOD JOB IN GETTING THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT RECYCLING IS AN IMPORTANT THING -- I AND THAT THAT WE CAN DO IT WE PROVIDED THE FACILITY FOR THEM TO TO DO IT -- AND YET OF THE ACTUAL RECYCLING RATES -- HAS DROPPED ABOUT TEN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF BLOOD -- WHAT IT WAS IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN AND THEN ACCORDING TO YOUR MOST RECENT REPORT THE LEGISLATURE THE BEVERAGE RECYCLING FUND HAS A SURPLUS OF THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS SO YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE HAVE A SURPLUS -- LIKE THIS IN A FUN THAT I THINK IS DUE TO GO UP. A IF I'M READING THAT -- THE STAFF REPORT CORRECTLY -- THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN A AND THAT THAT FUND BALANCE IS GOING TO GROW EVEN MORE WHY AREN'T WE USING THAT MONEY. TO IMPROVE RECYCLING RIGHTS I THINK IS THE KIND OF FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU AND I GET OAK DON'T WANT TO SURPRISE YOU WITH THAT QUESTION. TRY NOT TO YOU KNOW DO -- YOU KNOW BEING A GOTCHA MODE HERE I KNOW YOU'RE VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- SO IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US SOME FEEDBACK -- ON THAT ISSUE IN THE COURSE OF YOUR COMMENTS I WOULD APPRECIATE IT OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND WE CAN TAKE MORE TIME BECAUSE WE'RE STILL EARLY HERE -- LET ME JUST SAY THAT ON ON YOUR SPECIFIC ITEMS WE HAVE -- A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE ALL THREE OF THE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT YOU'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS HERE TODAY OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SCOTT SMITH ONE OF THE DIRECTOR OF COVER CYCLING JOINED TODAY BY OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CAN ROSA -- I GUESS I'LL START WHERE YOU STARTED -- MISTER CHAIR THAT IT'S A LOT TO UNPACK -- ARE THERE AND AND I'M HESITANT TO TO LEAVE ANY MISUNDERSTANDING SEVERAL TRYING JUST BRIEFLY RUN THROUGH IT AND THEN TRY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO YOUR YOUR ULTIMATE QUESTION -- SO -- I GUESS I CAN CONFIRM A LOT OF WHAT YOU SAID HERE STATISTICALLY WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE SEEN A DROP IN THE RECYCLING RATE AND IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT EVERY PERCENTAGE MATTERS WERE BELOW THE STATUTORY GOLD 80% FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THAT CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO US. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT THAT I THINK MAY NOT BE TOTALLY APPARENT -- YOU KNOW IN THOSE IN IN THOSE ENSUING YEARS WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NEW FRAUD MEASURES THAT WE THINK HAVE. REDUCED ILLEGAL REDEMPTION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN RECURRING WHICH IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE AND IRIS REFER TO SHARE RESPONSIBILITY OVER THAT FUND. AT THE SAME TIME THAT RATE REPRESENTS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEVERAGE SALES AND REDEMPTION AND WE HAVE SEEN A TAPE BRING IN SOME CASES OF THE BEVERAGE SALES SO REDEMPTION IS ACTUALLY BEEN. RELATIVELY ARE WE START WITHIN AN INCREASE IN BEVERAGE SALES REDEMPTION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY FLAT -- SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE'RE NOT GETTING MORE REDEMPTION GIVEN THAT SALES ARE GOING UP -- IT'S CERTAINLY. THAT IS DUE TO THE THE CLOSURES OF SOME THE SITE WE DON'T SEE A SIGNIFICANT DROP OFF BECAUSE OF THOSE BUT WE HAVE SEEN A DROP UP BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CLOSURES -- WITH RESPECT TO THE THE THE SURPLUS I JUST WANTED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT OUR TERMS HERE -- THANK YOU BECAUSE I'M YEAH I'M PRETTY SURE I YOU KNOW MISSTATED YEAH WE DO WITHOUT FUND AND AND I MAYBE I SHOULD JUST PREFACE THIS BY SAYING. BE VERY HAPPY TO COME IN A WALK THROUGH THE QUARTERLY REPORT IN IN INTO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE THE FUND CONDITION AND THE CONDITION OF ALL THE SUB ACCOUNTS AND THE RELEVANT FACTORS THAT LIMIT OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO USE DIFFERENT SUB ACCOUNTS AND WHY THAT MIGHT BE. RELEVANT BUT THE THE REFLECTS THAT THE FUNNY CONDITIONER -- FUND -- THE FUND -- YEAH FUND CONDITION OF TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- THE SIXTY FOUR MILLION. THAT YOU REFERENCED WAS A POTENTIAL PROJECTED SURPLUS BUT THOSE AGAIN ALL THESE NUMBERS ARE PROJECTIONS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DATA THAT WE'RE SEEING SEEING WE DON'T. THINK THAT NECESSARILY BE COMING TO FRUITION THINGS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THAT SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE ALL POINT IN TIME ESTIMATES -- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT EVEN IF THAT FUND CONDITION PROJECTED -- IS ON THE ORDER OF THREE AND A MILLION DOLLARS AT ANY GIVEN POINT TIME. THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS WE COULD HAVE A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS NOT AVAILABLE TO US BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE PAYING OUT. IN ADVANCE -- CRB BEFORE WE'RE GETTING IT BACK FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR SO JUST BECAUSE THE FUND BALANCES THERE DOES MEAN THERE'S A CASH AVAILABLE FOR US TO EXPAND AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD JUST ADD THAT -- THESE NUMBERS CAN CHANGE WILDLY -- OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR TO EVERY SINGLE PERCENT INCREASE OR OR EVERY SINGLE PERCENT DECREASE BEVERAGE SALES IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FUND EVERY -- PERCENT INCREASE REDEMPTION IS ALSO ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND SO. IF WE SEE JUST A COUPLE PERCENT INCREASES ON THOSE SIX THREE SIXTY TO EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ALL SAID THAT IT'S NOT MANIFESTING FOR SO THAT THERE ARE WILD SWINGS IN THESE NUMBERS A WHILE THEY LOOK LIKE VERY LARGE FUND BALANCES WE DO HAVE. TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT BUT TO COME TO YOUR YOUR YOUR ULTIMATE QUESTION -- I THINK WE WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT -- THERE'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW WITH THE REDEMPTION CENTERS THE RECYCLING CENTERS MISSTATED CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT HAVE CAUSED THAT -- ONE OF THEM ABSOLUTELY IS THAT -- YOU KNOW THE PUT THE PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ALWAYS PROVIDE THAT THE A PAYMENT THAT REFLECTS THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE RECYCLING CENTERS DUE TO THE TIMING OF HOW WE HAVE TO DO OUR CALCULATIONS PER STATUTE. ANOTHER IS THAT ONE OF THE MAIN -- FACTORS THAT ALLOW THESE RECYCLING CENTERS TO STAY A FLOW IMPROBABLE HAS BEEN THE FACT THAT ALUMINUM IS AT BEEN A VERY VALUABLE COMMODITY FOR THESE RECYCLING CENTERS -- AND AS WE SEE LESS QUICKLY UNLESS ALUMINUM IN THE MARKET PLACE COMPARED TO OTHER PACKAGING TYPES -- THEIR PROFIT IS IT'S BEEN GOING DOWN AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN A RECENT VERY SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE PRICE OF ALUMINUM WHICH IS PUTTING ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ALL THESE RECYCLING CENTERS. SO I THINK -- IT'S IT'S A FAIR QUESTION THE TODAY SOMETHING THAT WOULD AGE DÃ¢N SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE COULD THE ONE WE WENT OVER THE FINE CONDITION -- THANK YOU FOR THE RATHER DETAILED. RESPONSE AND FOR YOU KNOW SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON ALL AND THE LIMITATIONS ON THE FUND AND AND THE CALLS ON THE PHONE -- I THINK THE UNDERLYING ISSUE HERE AT THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW. IS HOW DO WE TURN THIS AROUND -- AND MAKE CALIFORNIA -- IN THE NATION OF AS AS IT SHOULD BE WE'VE BEEN. DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME FOR FOR MANY MANY DECADES NOW -- WERE WELL PRACTICED AT IT WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND -- WHERE THE IMPROVEMENTS NEED TO BE AND AND THE OF I LOOK FORWARD -- UNDER THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND FIXING IT -- WE WE NEED TO BE FLEET OF FOOT WHEN -- WE LIVE IN A IN A TIME WHEN THINGS DO CHANGE. OF VERY QUICKLY WE DIDN'T KNOW A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT CHINA WAS GOING -- TO YOU KNOW CHANGE -- ITS RULES ON WHAT IT WAS WILLING TO ACCEPT A MINISTER MEDICALLY CHANGE THE THE PLAYING FIELD HERE IN OUR ABILITY -- TO ADAPT AND ADJUST AND A KEEPER SYSTEM GOING SEEMS TO BE -- VERY CALCIFIED AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME REASONS FOR THAT BUT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA -- TRYING CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS A PRIORITY ISSUE AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU COLLABORATIVELY -- TO BRING ABOUT A CHANGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER -- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MOVE INTO THE THREE ITEMS YES PLEASE OKAY YOU HAVE TO SO -- WITH RESPECT TO THIS DAY WHAT WAYS CHARACTERIZATION STUDY COVERS LIKE REQUESTS NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND FROM THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT FOR WASTE CHARACTERIZATION STUDY -- THE STUDY DATA ALSO WHETHER THE STATE NEEDS SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE TARGET. OF A 505050% REDUCTION INDISPOSED ORGANIC WASTE BY TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE TWO PARTS. TO THIS STUDY ON THE FIRST PART IS THE TRADITIONAL WAYS CHARACTERIZATION STUDY WHERE WE CHARACTERIZE WASTE COMING FROM TRANSFER STATIONS AND DISPOSAL FACILITIES. THE SECOND PART IS SLIGHTLY MORE SOPHISTICATED THIS WE WHERE WE CHARACTERIZE WAYS FROM A TARGETED -- SECTOR OF GENERATOR SO WASTE AT THE POINT OF GENERATION BECAUSE THE WASTE CAN CHANGE FROM THE POINT OF GENERATION TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S DISPOSE THE CHARACTER -- CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WASTE -- OVER THE YEARS WASTE CHARACTERIZATION STUDIES HAVE BEEN OF VERY SIGNIFICANT POLICY MAKING TOOL FOR THE DATA CALIFORNIA FRANKLY FOR OTHERS -- I THINK RIGHT NOW IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY DUE TO THE LEGISLATIVE SORT OF TRIGGERED ANALYSIS. BUT ALSO DUE TO AS YOU MENTIONED THE CHANGING THE INTERNATIONAL -- COMMODITIES -- SHE'S NOT WANTING TO IMPORT OUR MATERIALS ANYMORE SO THAT'S CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON WHAT WORKS BEST -- APOLOGIZE I TOOK HIM OUT OF ORDER -- THAT'S OKAY OKAY I HARDLY NOTICED. IF YOU'D SAID NOTHING. HE WOULD HAVE HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT -- SOME MOVE -- TO AT LET ME JUST SAY A YEAH FINANCE ARE AT LA -- HAVE ANY -- ON EACH OF THESE HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO ADD JUST -- SPEAK UP JUST COMPUTERS BUT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THIS SPECIFIC PROPOSAL REGARDING THE WEEDS CHARACTERIZATION STUDY AND AS STAFF NOTES IN THE AGENDA AND THIS IS A TWENTY TWENTY SORT OF A MILESTONE YEAR AN IMPORTANT POINT OF TRYING. TO TRACK AND HOW THE STATE IS DOING IT MEETING ITS EXISTING GOALS AND SETTING BASS LINE FOR NEW GOALS AND SO HAVING THE STATE AND INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL -- TO THIS COMMITTEE INTO THE LEGISLATURE INTO THE DEPARTMENT TO TO EVALUATE IMPROVEMENTS GOING FORWARD [inaudible] THANK YOU. YES WE WILL -- TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. IF THERE IS ANY. WELCOME MR MURRAY. MR MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP BUT CALIFORNIA'S AGAINST WASTE BIG FAN OF THE WASTE CHARACTERIZATION STUDY -- THE THERE IS A HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA DOING THESE IN THE THE STORY THAT THOSE WAYS CHARACTERIZATIONS -- TELL US ABOUT. ABOUT THE STORY THAT THAT TELLS US ABOUT NOT ONLY WHAT WE'RE THROWING AWAY BUT WHAT WE'RE CONSUMING IS REALLY VALUABLE IN TERMS OF SHAPING OUR POLICY IN TERMS OF ADVOCATING FOR SOURCE REDUCTION. ADDITIONAL RECYCLING SO. VERY BIG FAN OF THAT SUPPORTING THAT ALSO -- OTHER ITEM THERE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE THIS IS THE LEGISLATION WHERE. WE GAVE CAL RECYCLE GREATER AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY FOR RECYCLING OF PARTICULAR PROBLEM PACKAGING MATERIAL AND WE LIKE THE WAY THAT THEY'RE EXERCISING THAT I THINK THAT AS YOUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION AND BALK BILL WHEN. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ASKFOR THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD APPROVE GREATER FOR SIMILAR GREATER FLEXIBILITY INPUT IMPLEMENTATION THE BOTTLE BILL SO THAT WE CAN. FOCUS SOME OF THAT SURPLUS FOR SOME WHICH CONTINUE RECYCLING PROGRAM. IT'S BAD WHEN PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO IMPLEMENT THEIR MISSION BUT IT'S ALSO BAD WHEN CONSUMER MONEY IS LEFT ON THE SIDELINES WHEN MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS SITTING ON THE SIDELINES. AND WE'RE NOT USING THAT TO INVEST RECYCLING WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A OBVIOUS CRISIS THAT EVERYONE AGREES. APPRECIATE THANKS THANK YOU -- WELL I THINK WHAT WAS VOTER THEM COLLECTIVELY AT THE END SO LET'S PROCEED TO THE NEXT ITEM. NO. OKAY SO TAKE SEPARATE VOTES BUT LET'S FINISH THE PRESENTATIONS AND THEN TAKE ABOUT. OKAY I THINK I'M ON ITEM NUMBER EIGHT IF I'M BACK ON TRACK HERE. CALPERS LIKE REQUEST ONE PERMANENT FULL TIME SENIOR OF OUR MIDDLE SCIENTIST AND HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND FROM THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT FUND IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT. SENATE BILL -- THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE PROHIBITS. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE PROHIBITS STATE FOOD SERVICE FACILITIES FROM DISTRIBUTING FOOD SERVICE WHERE THAT IS NOT REASONABLE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. ADDRESS CAL RECYCLE TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS AND ESTABLISH A PROCESS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER -- SERVICE PACKAGING IS REASONABLE RECYCLER COMPOSTABLE IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO CONDUCT ONGOING EVALUATIONS OF OF THE FOOD SERVICE PACKAGING. A VERY IS AN ALICE'S MATERIALS PRODUCT PERFORMANCE AND AND OF LIFE ASSESSMENT OF RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS -- TECHNICAL STANDARDS INTESTINE EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AGENCIES. DEFINING THESE TERMS WILL ALLOW CAL RECYCLE TO EVALUATE PRODUCTS BASED ON CRITERIA UNIQUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] QUESTION [inaudible] SIX MR MILLER. THIS IS SO. I SEE SOME NOTES ABOUT A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT. IN THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT. FIND. DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE A GAME PLAN ON ADDRESSING THE STRUCTURAL. DEFICIT. SO AGAIN -- IF I IF YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC NUMERICAL QUESTIONS I'M ASKED -- JEEP DEPUTY TO HELP ME BUT THE ANSWER IS YES -- THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE TRACK VERY CLOSELY -- WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A NUMBER OF POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS -- IN IN THE FUTURE AS AS WE SEE THIS IS A ON COMING PROBLEM -- SOME OF THEM ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE -- AND SOME OF THEM ARE MORE COMPLICATED AND MIGHT -- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS A COUPLE ISSUES AT ONCE AS WE GO THROUGH THIS IN A SIMPLE APPROACH MIGHT JUST BE AN INCREASE IN OUR TRADITIONAL FEE -- BUT WE'VE ALSO OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO ENGAGE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES -- TO FIND NOT ONLY THE DEPARTMENT BUT ALSO -- REYES -- REVENUE TO COULD PROVIDE BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INVEST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE NEW -- NEW STATUTES THAT WE'RE SEEING -- SO YES WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF ANALYSIS ON THAT IN OUR ENGAGED IN THAT PROCESS. HI THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PUBLIC COMMENT SO -- WENCH MOVE ON YOUR THIRD ITEM I THINK THAT'S NINE RIGHT. YES NUMBER -- NINE PHARMACEUTICAL SHARKS. CAL CYCLE WRECK A REQUEST ONE POINT FOUR MILLION AND PHARMACEUTICAL AND SHARP STEWARDSHIP FUND INTEND POSITIONS AND ONE POINT TWO MILLION ON GOING. BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TO IMPLEMENT. SB. TWO TWELVE SENATE BILL. TWO TWELVE DIRECTS PHARMACEUTICAL AND SHARKS MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS LICENSE THAT'S WHOLESALERS RE PACKAGERS LIENSEES OF TRADE MARKS ARE BRANDON IMPORTERS TO ESTABLISH A PHARMACEUTICAL AND SHARP EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM. THIS PRIVATE SECTOR DESIGNED APPROACH WOULD ESTABLISH A PHARMACEUTICAL INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR PROPER END OF LIFE MANAGEMENT OF COVERED DRUGS AND HOME GENERATED SHARKS -- BY -- THIS WOULD DECREASE THE NUMBER OF UNWANTED DRUGS IN TRUCKS MENTORING TRADITIONAL WASTE STREAMS. THE UNIVERSE OF POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS -- IS VERY EXPANSIVE IS APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND PHARMACIES AS WELL AS OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL ENTITIES LICENSED BY THE BOARD WITH IN CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY OVER FIVE HUNDRED PHARMACEUTICAL INSERTS MANUFACTURERS WILL FALL UNDER CALPERS CYCLES PURVIEW AS A RESULT -- AN ACT OF ENACTMENT OF SENATE BILL. TWO TWELVE THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS PUBLIC YES MISTER MULLIN. SO THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED IS THAT OUR IS THAT ALREADY HAPPENING. NOT YET WHAT WHAT'S A TIME LINE ON THE CAN TO WRESTLE WITH THE CAL RECYCLE WAY. FROM THE PROGRAM REALLY BEING UP AND RUNNING SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO COLLECT THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE FEES THAT WILL SUSTAIN THE PROGRAM THE OPERATIONS IN THE STAFFING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO IN THE INTERIM. BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO BUILD THE PROGRAM PROMULGATE THE REGULATIONS BUILD DATABASES -- WE ARE BORROWING FROM THE E. WASTE FUND I THINK -- ROUGHLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN THAT RATCHETS UP TO THIRTY MILLION AND THEN WILL YOU KNOW FIGURE OUT A MECHANISM TO REPAY THE E. WASTE ON BUT BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL ENTITIES REGISTERED WE DON'T HAVE. THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION ONLINE IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH CARPET PAINT MATTRESSES AND YOU KNOW THOSE THE PR PROGRAMS THERE'S ALWAYS AN ADVANCE LAY OUT. AND THEN WE WE GET BACK TO THAT ONCE THE REVENUE ACTUALLY COMES AND AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON ON WHERE WE ARE IN THAT PROCESS WE'VE HAD ALREADY TOO INFORMAL WORKSHOPS -- REAL INTO INFORMAL RULEMAKING WORKSHOPS ON SB TWO TWELVE AND TWO MORE ARE PLANNED SO WE'RE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING THAT THERE'S A FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE REGULATORY DEADLINE FOR US TO MEET AND THAT -- PROGRAM. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT. THEN -- THAT WILL -- COMPLETE OUR HEARING ON THESE ITEMS -- WILL MOVE ON TO VOTE ON ISSUES EIGHT NINE AND TEN WE'VE HAD A REQUEST TO VOTE SEPARATELY ON ISSUE EIGHT SO IS THERE A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU BLOOM HI FONG. YEAH. MULLIN. PATTERSON NO [inaudible] RAY S.. IS THERE A MOTION TO APPROVE FOR A ISSUES NINE AND TEN BLOOM HI FONG. GARCIA. MULLIN. PATTERSON. RAY S. REVERSE.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER -- HEIGHTS IT'S BEEN I THINK ABOUT A MONTH NOW THAT I I'VE BECOME CHAIR SO I'M STILL STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE DOES AND AND WHAT MY PRIORITIES ARE BUT -- I DO KNOW THAT ALTERNATELY BERMAN SERVICES BETTER -- THE STATE BOARD WE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF OUR PURVIEW ON WATER RIGHTS -- WATER QUALITY AND AND DRINKING WATER HAVE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES TO A KIND OF FIGURE OUT. HOW YOU BREAK DOWN SILOS BETWEEN THOSE REGULATORY STRUCTURES THE DIFFERENCE IN A DRINK WATER BEING SO NEW? AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO JUST FINDING WAYS TO BE INNOVATIVE WITH MY AGENCY SO [inaudible] THANK YOU. PLEASE DIVE RIGHT IN YOUR ISSUES YES ALL START WITH THE ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN I'M TERRIBLE HE WAS DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER -- ISSUE NUMBER -- ELEVEN OUR LABORATORY -- WORKED AS PERFORMED FOR THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER REMAINS AT THE GIVE ME THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- SO THIS STUFF FUNDING REQUEST IS FOR EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY AND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND ON GOING AFTER THAT. TO DO SEVERAL THINGS FIRST -- WERE. OF MOVING FORWARD WITH ASKING THE LABORATORY TO BECOME TEEN I COMPLIANT THAT'S A NATIONAL STANDARD THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS -- HAVING ALL THE LAUGHTER TORIES IN CALIFORNIA THE BOARD WILL CONSIDER REGULATIONS CONSIDERING THAT SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE SO. NOT DONE DEAL BUT IT'S A GOOD MEASURE DOES HAVE OUR LAB OF ENTER INTO THAT FRAME -- ALSO -- A DRINK IN MODERATION LABORATORIES ARE REFERENCE LABORATORY SO PART OF OUR GREEN WITH YOU SEE PA IS THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PERFORM -- ALL THE NOW SAYS AS WE NEED FOR THE ENTIRE SUITE OF UP. MATERIALS THAT HAVE TO BE TESTED UNDER THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT OF THROUGH OUR CONTINUED KIND OF REFINING OF THAT WE DETERMINE THAT THEY ARE NEEDED SOME EGGS EXTRA RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO ADD THE METHODS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THAT ENTIRE LISTA WERE -- ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN EQUIPMENT AND AND INCREASED METHOD -- CAPABILITY ON THEIR PART FOR THAT AS WELL AND THEN -- FINALLY A IS THE ADDITION OF OF THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM NEW ANALYSIS IS FOR US AND DEVELOP NEW METHODS THAT WORK WE SEEK INCREASING IN THE FUTURE. OF WITH THE THOUSAND OTHER MATERIALS COMING ONLINE SO IT'S A WILL BE FOR THAT ENTIRE THING. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS ON ON ISSUE -- ELEVEN WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE CLOSE OF ISSUES ELEVEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN WILL DO THAT COLLECTIVELY CAN SPEAK ON ANY ITEM YOU WANT IF YOU DESIRE TO ADD PUBLIC COMMENT -- SO -- ISSUE. TWELVE SO ISSUE NUMBER. TWELVE IN THIS WERE ASKING FOR IT -- AN INCREASE OF SIX ADDITIONAL PERMANENT STOP IN THE FUNDING FOR THE STAFF OF A ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. OF FOR INCREASING OUR SENATORS SURVEY WORK THIS IS OUR OUR MAIN WORK DO WE DO APPROXIMATELY 60% OF OUR STAFF TIME IN THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER SPENT DOING SENATORSSURVEYS IT'S OUR MAIN WAY OF MAKING SURE WATER SYSTEMS ARE COMPLIANT AND IN. ACCORDANCE WITH THE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS REGULATIONS WE'VE ADOPTED. THIS IS THE SECOND STEP WEEK -- INCREASED ONCE BEFORE WITH A TEN ADDITIONAL STOP TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE SENATORS SURVEY -- WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE BACK LOAD OF FROM THAT -- INCREASE IN THIS IS ABOUT THE TIME THEY CAME OVER TO THE TO THE WATER BOARD FROM ABOUT -- A BEAMING BEING ABLE TO COMPLETE UP TO ABOUT 88% NOW. THIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCE WILL ALLOW US TO EXTEND THAT INTO THE PROGRESS ON THAT SO THAT WE MAKE SURE WE GET ALL THIS DONE AS BEST WE CAN. THANK YOU -- QUESTIONS SEEING NONE ISSUE -- THIRTEEN ONE THAT'S OF GREAT INTEREST TO ME AS A KERRY LEGISLATION ON THIS -- GENERAL TOPIC AND TO SENATOR PORTANTINO I THINK WHOSE -- WAS THE AUTHOR OF SB FORTY FOUR YES I THINK A GRAPHIC AND DEFINITELY A HOT SO THIS IS A A AND ESTABLISHING A TESTING METHOD FOR MICRO PLASTIC SO. KIND OF THE FIRST STEP REQUIRED OF ANYTHING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO COULD CONTEMPLATE BOTH WHAT IT'S HEALTH IMPACTS WILL BE ANY FUTURE REGULATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT. IS NECESSARY ESTABLISHING A UNIFORM OUT THAT THAT ANYBODY CAN GO OUT AND PERFORM AND WE GET A VALID ANSWER BACK FROM WHOEVER IS PERFORMING ITSELF. ALL RIGHT NOW IN MICHAEL PLASTICS THERE ARE A LOT OF RESEARCH GOING ON THERE'S A LOT OF ACADEMIC METHODS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT THEY ALL PERFORM A LITTLE DIFFERENT VALUE AND GIVE YOU DIFFERENT RESULTS. SO THIS IS A REQUEST HERE IS FOR US TO BE ABLE -- TO BASICALLY DEVELOP A METHOD UNIVERSALLY -- THAT WE CAN THEN DEPLOY AND AND START DOWN THE PROGRESS OF UNDERSTANDING MICHAEL PLASTICS AND AS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THESE ARE SUPER COMPLEX BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WHEN YOU SAY MICHAEL PLASTICS THAT CAN INCLUDE. PAINT CHIPS MICROFIBER FROM CLOTHING -- DISSOLVE PLASTIC MATERIALS GOES ON AND ON AND SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE IT'S A VERY BROAD THING TO SAY MICHAEL PLASTIC IT SEEMS LIKE ONE THING BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT IT'S MULTIPLE THINGS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO CATALOG DOESN'T WORK TOWARDS THEM. IT IS VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE CREATED FOR UNWITTINGLY FOR OUR FOR OURSELVES AND I THINK THE SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO BE -- A DIFFICULT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EXISTS YET EXACTLY DEFINITELY. IF THERE'S NO -- QUESTIONS WILL MOVE ON A FOURTEEN ISSUE NUMBER -- FOURTEEN IS TO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE OF ABOUT NINE A TWENTY FOUR FOR THE GENERAL FUND AND FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR ON GOING SUPPORT FOR TO PART OF THE PERMANENT POSITIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO AN EXPERT PANEL. FOR ON SITE RECYCLING. THIS IS BASICALLY RECYCLING WITH IN BUILDINGS NOT GENERALLY RECYCLING AS MUNICIPAL WASTE WHICH WE'VE DONE A LOT OF IN CALIFORNIA -- CONTINUE TO PROGRESS ON THAT FRONT AS WELL BUT THERE IS AN INCREASING TREND OF SMALL IN BUILDING SYSTEMS SPECIALLY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND LA IN URBAN CENTERS WHERE. A RECYCLING A WITHIN THE BUILDING BEFORE THEY LET GO OF IT MAKES SENSE -- BUT THERE'S A LACK OF REGULATION THERE THEY'VE REQUESTED THAT WE HELP HIM DEVELOP THAT REGULATION THIS REGULATION WILL BE BASICALLY A FRAMEWORK WHERE LOCAL AGENCIES WILL COUNTIES AND AND CITIES CAN THEN ADOPT. THAT PROBE SPECIFICALLY THE FRAMEWORK WHICH LOCALS CAN OPT IN TO DO THAT AND WE'RE A HELP HAPPY TO ASSIST IN THAT AREA. THANK YOU ISSUE. FIFTEEN GOOD MORNING CHAPLAIN MY MYLEENE SUFFOCATE SECULAR DIRECTOR OF THE STATE WATER BOARD -- ISSUE FIFTEEN INVOLVES SEWER SERVICE PROVISION FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE THE STATE BOARD REQUEST THREE INITIAL PERMANENT POSITIONS AND 500-250-00100 THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM. OF WAYS DISTRICT PERMIT FUND SPENDING. FOR OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY AND THEN SIX ADDITIONAL PERMANENT POSITIONS AND ONE MILLION SO -- ABOUT -- SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE WASTE DISCHARGE PERMIT FUND -- ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SB TWELVE FIFTEEN AUTHORIZED REGIONAL -- WATER PORTS TO ORDER CITY COUNTY OR SPECIAL DISTRICT WITH AN EX EXISTING RECEIVING SYSTEM -- TO PROVIDE SEWER SERVICES TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH INADEQUATE SEPTIC TANKS SYSTEMS -- THIS IS FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTION OF POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO SOURCES OF OF DRINKING WATER SO WE NEED TO LOOK BOTH THAT THE DRINKING WATER END OF THINGS AND THE PROVIDING ADEQUATE SANITATION -- AND IN A DAZE. I'M CURRENTLY THERE'S LITTLE INCENTIVE FOR MOST PROPERTY ON OWNERS TO MAKE A CHANGE FROM SEPTIC TO SEWER -- SEPTIC TANKS OFTEN SERVE RURAL SPARSELY POPULATED AREAS -- LEADING PROPERTY OWNERS WITH NO -- NO OBVIOUS REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE -- EVEN WHEN I'M PROPERTY OWNERS ARE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES WITH SEWER SYSTEMS. THE COST OF REMOVING THEIR SEPTIC TANKS CAN RUN INTO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. THE CHALLENGES ARE MAGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT FREQUENTLY -- ADJACENT -- WITH WATER TREATMENT EFFORT WICKS EXISTING WASTE WATER TREATMENT AGENCIES THAT ARE -- IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THESE AREAS -- ARE UNWILLING TO TAKE ON AND EXTEND -- SERVICES. TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SERVED BY SEPTIC TANKS. SO THESE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW THE STATE AND THE REGIONAL BOARDS TO IMPLEMENT THE REQUIREMENTS OF SB -- TWELVE FIFTEEN AN ORDER OF NECESSARY CONSOLIDATIONS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH A LOT OF PROCESS BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY FOR VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATIONS -- MAKING SURE THAT THE THERE'S ASSIST -- LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING SOURCES -- TO ASSIST IN THESE PROCESSES WILL BE SO THE SO THIS -- SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S IT FOR THIS PROPOSAL. CHEN CHAIR IF I MAY UM IT WILL BE SPEAKING WITH THE SECRETARY ROSS HERE SOON ON CLEAN AND SAFE BUT OFTENTIMES THE SANITATION COMPONENT TO THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IS OVERLOOKED. AND IS QUICK KEY AND CRITICAL TO ALSO ADDRESSING AS WE ALSO LOOKED AT ADDRESS ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER. THAT MAKES SENSE. ISSUE -- TWO SIXTEEN YES ISSUE -- SIXTEEN IN THE WE THE STATE WATERBOARD IS REQUESTING TO POINT MILLION TWO MILLION DOLLARS FUNDED. IN PART -- BY THE WATER RIGHTS FUND THAT WOULD BE FOR ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT THE BALANCE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR THE SUPPORT OF NINE PERMANENT POSITIONS -- TO ESTABLISH AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE. AT WHICH WILL A BRIGHT PROVIDE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICERS AND SUPPORT STAFF TO CONDUCT ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS IN WATER RIGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS -- IN -- AND TO PREPARE -- THERE'S ALSO REQUEST A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS -- FOR CONTRACTING FOR FOR CERTAIN -- ECONOMIC TECHNICAL EXPERTISE WHEN NEEDED. SO THE STATE BOARD -- ANTICIPATES PROSECUTING MORE WATER RIGHT AND FOR SPENT CASES IN -- THE THE NEXT -- pDUE TO RECENT WATER RIGHT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND NEW CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY. AND WE ALSO EXPECT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM AND THE SUSTAINABLE GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT ACT WILL ALSO RESULT IN MORE HEARING REQUEST TO OUR STATE BOARD IN COMING YEARS -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN A. B. -- THREE THREE THIRTEEN WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN HOWEVER IN HIS VETO MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR ACKNOWLEDGE THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO INCLUDE INCREASE BURNESS AND% TRANSPARENCY -- WAS WAS LAUDABLE BUT CONCLUDED THAT THE BILL WOULD NOT WORK AS INTENDED -- THERE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE DIRECTED THE SECRETARY OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL ROLE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AND PROVIDE A RECOMMENDATION FOR IMPROVEMENT TO THE BOARDS HEARING PROCESS. AND THE SECRETARY'S RECOMMENDATION WHICH WAS -- PREPARED AND SUBMITTED CALLS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING OFFICE AS A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT WITHIN THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO PROVIDE QUALIFIED IMPARTIAL HEARING MATTER MATTERS. SO DO TO OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS WITH KNOWLEDGE AND THAT INCLUDES COMPETING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOARD MEMBERS AND KEY STAFF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BACKLOG. ON PROCESSING HEARING REQUEST ON THERE CAN BE LONG DELAYS BETWEEN -- I REQUEST AND A HEARING AND EVEN WHEN A HEARING IS HELD -- THERE CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY BETWEEN COMPLETION OF THE HEARING AND RELEASE OF THE PROPOSED -- DECISION. SO HAVING HEARINGS HELD BY HEARING OFFICERS WHO CAN -- APPLY SPECIALIZED KNOWLEDGE AND WHO ARE DEDICATED TO THESE PURPOSES -- AND THEY CAN PREPARE THE CAN HOLD HEARINGS -- PREPARE PROPOSED DECISIONS AS AUTHORIZED BY SB SEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE -- THE PROCESS IF IT SIGNIFICANTLY FUNDED TO HANDLE THESE RESPONSIBILITIES. SO WHILE THE FORK FOCUSES ON ENFORCEMENT THE OFFICE WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE TO HEAR AN EXPEDITE OTHER WATER RIGHTS PROCEEDINGS. AFTER FOR FILLING ITS ENFORCEMENT HEARING OBLIGATIONS -- AND THAT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RELIEVE THE OF THE BACKLOG THAT EXIST IN THOSE CATEGORIES OF THE PORTS WORK -- AS I NOTED 25% OF THE REQUESTED FUNDS ARE FROM THE GENERAL FUNDS BECAUSE WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME HEARINGS WILL INVOLVE ENFORCEMENT AGAINST PERSONS NOT SUBJECT TO WATER RIGHT FEES UNDER EXISTING LAWS. BECAUSE THEY DIVERT. UNDER A PARENT OR PRE NINETEEN FOURTEEN APPROPRIATE RIGHT. AND ARE NOT SET UP SUBJECT TO EXISTING WATER RIGHT FEES THERE -- FOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ARE NEEDED OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE AND WE WILL YOU KNOW BE ABLETO ADJUST THIS IN OUT YEARS BASED ON THE ACTUAL LOAD AND WE'RE CLOSE AT THE OFFICE IS. IS A PROSELYTIZATION OF THE HEARING OFFICE COSTS. WILL INVOLVE THE VOTERS NOT SUBJECT FEES. THANK YOU ONE OF THE MORE -- BUT NOT NOT UNCOMMON ARCANE -- RESIDUALS OF CALIFORNIA LAW AROUND WATER -- AB THERE'S NO QUESTIONS SO I'LL ASK YOU TO JUST MOVE RIGHT ON TO ISSUE. SEVENTY SHALL BE TAKEN NUMBER SEVENTEEN AGAIN. SO THIS -- ISSUE NUMBER SEVENTEEN WE'RE REQUESTING SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND AND ONGOING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT FOR FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS -- TO BASICALLY EXPAND THE POTENTIAL NUMBER CONSOLIDATION CASES THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THIS IS IN LIGHT OF AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE PASSING LAST YEAR -- AND MOVING FOR WITH THAT SO. IN ESSENCE -- IT TO BOIL IT DOWN THIS WILL BE A GOOD -- KIND OF SEGUE OR PER PER -- A PREVIEW FOR THE SAKE AFFORDABLE UNDER SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED WATER SYSTEMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY -- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE NUMBERS AND BOILING DOWN QUICKLY YOU SEE QUICKLY THAT -- WE HAVE OVER THREE THOUSAND COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THOSE OUR WATER SYSTEMS -- WITH LESS THAN FIVE INTERCONNECTIONS AND 90% OF OUR VIOLATIONS OCCUR AT THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS ARE OFTEN. IN NAY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER A DONUT HOLES WITHIN LARGER WATER SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO IMPLEMENTING THE TORIES. UNDER TWENTY FIVE A ONE WE HAVE -- THIS IS KIND OF EXPAND WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY DONE AND SENATE BILL EIGHTY A PREVIOUSLY TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO DO CONSOLIDATIONS AND A USE ADMINISTRATORS TO HELP FACILITATE THAT AS WELL NOW. SO THE STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT FURTHER WHAT OUR STAFF ALREADY DONE WE HAD TO STOP COME ON BOARD AFTER SB EIGHTY EIGHT WITH THE AUTHORITIES THEN. AND WE INSTANTLY JUMPED FROM OF FOR CONSOLIDATIONS YEAR TO AVERAGING BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY IN THE TWO YEARS AFTER THAT SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO FURTHER. IMPROVE THE UTILITY DELIVER WATER YOU WATER SYSTEM UTILITY DELIVER IN CALIFORNIA BY UPBRINGING OF CONSOLIDATING SYSTEMS TOGETHER THAT THE DESERVE TO BE THERE AND AND SERVING OF GOOD WATER TO THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR ALL THOSE PRESENTE SHINS SERVICING THOUGH QUESTIONS IS THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES ELEVEN THROUGH. SEVENTEEN HI AND THEN YOU'RE BLESSED HIDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION -- REGARDING OF THE THE HOST OF PROPOSALS WE APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT THERE WATER POURED IS ASKING I'LL BUT IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN THE FEE STRUCTURE FOR WATER SYSTEMS WAS CHANGED AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FEES. FOR A LOT OF OUR WATER SYSTEMS WITHIN OUR MEMBERSHIP. AND AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH LOOKING AT THESE PROPOSALS WE ASK THAT YOU LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THESE PROPOSALS THAT ARE -- LOOKING TO INCREASE CONTINUE TO INCREASE FEES ON WATER SYSTEM SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CHAIR NUMBERS NIKITA CRIED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL ON ISSUE SIXTEEN WE SUPPORT THE BUDGET REQUEST TO IMPLEMENT EIGHTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN AND ESTABLISH THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE -- WE THINK THESE RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE WATER RIGHTS AND AS WE KNOW THE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT OF WATER RATES IS CRITICAL TO PROTECT FISH AND WILDLIFE -- WATER RIGHT HOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL SO WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THIS AS BUDGET THANK YOU.

THE WATER BOARD HAS MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND AND CONCERT IF TIME PROVES THIS IS NECESSARY THE TECHNICAL STAFF WILL BE GLAD TO TALK. THE H. O. IN LAW IS EXEMPT FROM PROVIDING RULINGS WITHIN NINETY DAYS IF THE ISSUE IS NOVEL OR DIFFICULT. IF THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTIES OR WITNESSES IF THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF THAT EVIDENCE OR THE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH RELATED PROCEEDINGS.

SHOW AS WELL AS THE PROGRESS ON A B. C. P.. FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THAT WAS DESIGNED TO REDUCE -- BACKLOGS AND PERMIT PROCESSES OTHER IN SOME CASES NOT TO FORTY FOUR YEARS -- ALSO IT ONE LAST COMMENT WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF CANNABIS IS THE JUSTIFICATION FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAVE TESTIFIED HERE INTO THE WATER BOARD THAT CANNABIS FEE PAYERS IN STATUTE AND BUDGET LANGUAGE.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION ALSO I'D ON ITEM SIXTEEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE GENERALLY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE WITHIN THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WE THINK CAN MAKE WATER RIGHTS PROCESSES MORE EFFICIENT.

SEPTEMBER OUR LAST ISSUE OF THE DAY IS THIS YOU EIGHTEEN WERE WILL HAVE -- THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND CDFA. FOOD AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT -- TALK TO US ABOUT -- THE VEXING ISSUE OF SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. WELL GOOD MORNING AGAIN CHAIR BLOOM MORNING. I HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING AS CHAIR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR BUDGET REQUEST AN ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR PROVIDING SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. HAVE TODAY WITH ME TERRIBLE HIM IT'S AGAIN OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE TO OF THE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW IN TWENTY TWELVE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED AB SIX EIGHTY FIVE WHICH ESTABLISHED CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER POLICY. THAT POLICY CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY STATES THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS A RIGHT TO SAFE CLEAN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE DRINKING WATER WATER ADEQUATE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WITH YOUR HELP WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THIS REGARD. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH NEW AUTHORITIES TO ADDRESS THE DRINKING WATER PROBLEMS. IN JULY OF TWO TWENTY FOURTEEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FOR THE SAFE AND SAFE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM WAS TRANSFERRED FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO ALLOW FOR ONE AGENCY TO BE RESPONSIBLE FROM SOURCE THE TAP TO PROVIDE ONE STOP SHOPING FOR COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES FOR THE FUNDING NEEDS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE COME BACK TO YOU NEEDS TO DO THE JOB AND WE'VE GIVEN THEM AND YOU'VE GIVEN THEM TO US FOR EXAMPLE. PROP ONE CAPITAL. FOR CAPITAL FUNDING FOR DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THE ABILITY TO USE THOSE DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL. THE CREATION OF THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABLE WATER SOLUTIONS TO FOCUS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THEIR NEEDS. THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL SYSTEMS WITH LARGER SYSTEMS. LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW SMALLER SYSTEMS STOP THE BLEEDING. THE ABILITY TO HELP PRIVATE PROVIDE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES AND DOMESTIC WELL OWNERS IN CERTAIN CASES PARTICULARLY OWN -- OWING TO TO TO THE DROUGHT HE SUPPORTER OF BILLS PERHAPS THE BEST EXAMPLE. OF THIS AND ONE WE'RE NOW WE HAVE CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER FLOWING INTO HUNDREDS OF HOMES THAT WERE COMPLETELY WITHOUT WATER DURING THE DROUGHT. AND WITHOUT CLEAN WATER FOR MUCH LONGER TIME. AND YOU ALSO GIVE US THE ABILITY BUT LIMITED FUNDING TO HIRE AN ADMINISTRATOR TO MANAGE COMMUNITY SYSTEMS THAT SIMPLY LACKED THE MANAGERIAL FINANCIAL AND TECH TECHNICAL SKILLS TO MANAGE WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES. THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP MANY COMMUNITIES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HELPING MANY MORE. OVER THE PAST FOR YEARS FOR EXAMPLE THE BOARD HAS BROUGHT DRINKING WATER SYSTEM TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE FAILING TO DELIVERS SAFE DRINKING WATER BACK INTO COMPLIANCE. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN ACTIONS ARE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO WATER SYSTEMS THAT HAS LED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF A TOTAL OF NINETY SIX FAILING OR LIKELY TO FILL SYSTEM SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT HAS HELPED OVER TWO HUNDRED SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SECURE FUNDING FOR PROJECT PLANNING CONSTRUCTION THROUGH OFFICES STAINED WATER SOLUTIONS. AND WE PROVIDED OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN LOW INTEREST LOANS AND GRANTS BENEFITING APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL RICH AND POOR URBAN AND RURAL. THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE OF OUR REVOLVING FLAT LOAN PROGRAMS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS MANY LOCAL WATER THOSE SERVING SMALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES CONSISTENTLY FAIL TO PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WE HAVE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS UNDER OUR JURISDICTION THEY CAN'T CONSISTENTLY MEET. MEET STANDARDS AND I'M TOLD MANY MORE ARE TOO SMALL TO BE REGULATED BY THE STATE. WE ALSO OF UNTOLD THOUSANDS ON DOMESTIC WELL. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THOUSANDS WITH MORE SINCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PREVIOUSLY BUT WE STILL HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN RELIABLE DRINKING WATER. WHICH TOO MANY OF US IS THE PREEMINENT WATER ISSUE OF OUR TIME ONE THAT WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT. WE HAVE AN IMMEDIATE MORAL PAIRED UP TO ENSURE ALL. ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS I CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT MY TIME ON THE BOARD IN CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE I GET THE OVERWHELMING SENSE OF AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN NO LONGER ACCEPT THIS. GIVEN ALL THE NEW AUTHORITIES OF THE LEGISLATURE'S PROVIDED THE LAST REMAINING PIECE OF THE PUZZLE FOR ENSURING THAT. IS THAT THE THE LACK OF PROVISION FOR A STABLE FUNDING TERM FOR LONG TERM OP THE FUNDING SOURCE EXCUSE ME FOR A LONG TERM OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE FOR DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. THE LACK OF SUCH A STABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COSTS FOR HUNDREDS OF SMALL SYSTEMS AND DOMESTIC WELL THE CANNOT BE CONSOLIDATED. THIS IS IN A REQUEST OF FIRST RESORT. NOR IS IT A WAY TO INDEFINITELY PROP UP UNSUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS INSTEAD THE FUND IS THE KEYSTONE TO A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THAT THE STATE HAS THOUGHTFULLY PIECE TOGETHER. OVER THESE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE STATE'S LEGISLATURE IN CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE OVER THESE LAST YEAR'S. HAVE CRASS CHARACTER THESE AUTHORITIES. WHEN SKIP AHEAD I APOLOGIZE WHILE THE CHALLENGE -- TAXES CLEAN DRINKING WATER MY AS A RULE ISSUE. THE MAP ABOUT APPLIANCES SYSTEM SHOWS THAT IT'S A PROBLEM THAT IMPACTS COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS IS AN URBAN SUBURBN. AND RURAL PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION THE NEEDS ARE UNIQUE TO EACH COMMUNITY THAT IS FACING CHALLENGES. THE SOLUTIONS FOR COMMUNITIES WITH ARSENIC CONTAMINATED WELLS IN EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THOSE IT'S THAN STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS SMALL SYSTEMS AND URBAN LOS ANGELES WITH AGING AN ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE OR COMMUNITIES AND LIKE COUNTY. LOOKING TO BUILD RESILIENCE IN THE FRAGMENTED WATER SYSTEM SIR CONSOLIDATION. LASTLY I WANT TO ADDRESS DIRECTLY THE CONCERN THAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME THAT THE WATER FREE PROPOSED IN THE TRAILER BILL WILL NOT DIRECTLY BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE. ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER OF CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. AND AS CALIFORNIANS WE ALL PAY FOR A WIDE RANGE OF PUBLIC GOODS AND SERVICES. EVEN THROUGH EVEN THOUGH SOME GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT SOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN OTHERS. JUST AS PEOPLE IN REAL PARTS OF THE STATE HELP PAPER STORM WATER PROJECTS PRIMARY BENEFIT URBAN AREAS THROUGH BONDS. IT IS JUST AS REAL RISK REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ALREADY HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER TO CONTRIBUTE A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT YET HAVE ACCESS. IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A NEW SPECIAL FUND. FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ASSIST COMMUNITIES PARTICULAR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND PAYING FOR SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM COSTS OF ATTAINING ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING STATUTORY LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM THE PRICE GRANTS LOANS IN ADMINISTRATOR CONTRACTS OR SERVICES TO ASSIST ELIGIBLE COMMUNITIES AND HOUSEHOLDS AND SECURING ACCESS TO SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET PROPOSES FOUR POINT NINE MILLION FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO TAKE INITIAL STEPS TOWARD IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW PROGRAM INCLUDING. ONE DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING FEE COLLECTION SYSTEMS TO ADOPTION OF AN ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND THREE DEVELOPMENT OF A MAP OF HIGH WITH HIGH RISK AQUIFER'S USES DRINKING WATER SOURCES. WE HAVE TO ADD ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. LA L. SEAN MARTIN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND KAREN ALICE'S AT THIS AT THIS PROPOSAL WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND SOME ISSUES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. A FIRST SO IT'S UNCERTAIN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROPOSED REVENUES WILL FULLY ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS. THAT ADMINISTRATION IS NOT COMPLETED AN ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BRINGING WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO ME WATER QUALITY STANDARDS INTO COMPLIANCE -- ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THEY WERE FUNDED LAST FALL TO UNDERTAKE A STUDY -- AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY AND IN DISCUSSIONS WITH AND THEY INDICATED THAT SOME PARTS OF THE STUDY MAY BE AVAILABLE SOONER. WE KNOW THAT A PRIVATE CONSULTING FIRM DID AN ESTIMATE AND THEY ESTIMATED IT WOULD COST A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. HOWEVER THAT ESTIMATE IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE THE ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE ESTIMATES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY. WE ALSO NOTE THAT MOST CHARGE PAIRS WOULD NOT BE DIRECT BENEFICIARIES OF THE OF THE PROGRAM -- THE MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM WOULD BE PEOPLE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SIR BY SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS WOULD BE BORNE BY TWO GREAT PAIRS ACROSS THE STATE WITH AND THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME PERSONS AND CUSTOMERS -- ASSISTANCE WITH LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED CONNECTIONS SO. GENERALLY SPEAKING THEIR WEIGHT COULD BE SOME BENEFIT TO FOLKS SERVICE IN AN AREA WHERE THE THIS PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT THE WATER SYSTEM INTO COMPLIANCE BUT MOST OF THE RATE PAYERS IN THE STATE. WOULDN'T BE BENEFITING IT TOOK FROM IT THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY IN TERMS OF IN MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR WATER SYSTEM. WE ALSO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE CHARGE PAIRS. WOULD NOT BE AT FAULT FOR THE CONTAMINATION BE MEDICAID AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NITRATE CONTAMINATION IS CAUSED BY AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY SUCH AS FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS AND ANIL MODERATION SEARCHES AS DAIRIES. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO HAVE THESE AGRICULTURAL ENTITIES PLAY CHARGES CREATES A NICE LINK BETWEEN THE OPERATIONS THAT ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE NITRATE CONTAMINATION. AND THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD PAY THE CHARGES TO MEDICATE IT HOWEVER IT'S ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT SOME OF THAT NITRATE CONTAMINATION WOULD NOT BE A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR OPERATIONS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. THAT SOME OF THE CONTAMINATION A WAS FROM A LEGACY CONTAMINATION FROM DECADES AGO -- WE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE PROGRAM. I GENERALLY WE DIDN'T FIND WE FOUND THAT THERE LIMITED -- GENERAL FUND IS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM HOWEVER THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER PROGRAMS THAT RELY ON THE GENERAL FUND. OF FOR SUPPORT [inaudible] AND WE DON'T THINK THAT BOND FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE FOR FOR THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE OF THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THAT -- BOND FUND IT AND THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES AN ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE. AND WE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ANY EXISTING SPECIAL FUNDS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM IT WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE FUNDS -- FINALLY WE ALSO NOTE THAT THERE AS BECAUSE OF SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS ABOUT SOME TRADE OFFS COMPARED TO THE STATE'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT APPROACH. ON THE ONE HAND THE PROPOSAL IS STRUCTURED TO BETTER ENSURE THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR WATER QUALITY MITIGATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE RATHER THAN LIMITED AIR AREAS AND IN CERTAIN AREAS IN THE STATE YES BECAUSE THE STATE'S CURRENT ENFORCEMENT APPROACH. I GENERALIZE AND TARGETING INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS OF POLLUTERS IN A LIMITED GEOGRAPHIC AREA -- FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE REALLY USES CLEAN UP IN A DATE IN ORDER FOR NITRATE CONTAMINATION ON THE OTHER HAND THE THE PROPOSAL. THE STATE WOULD RELINQUISH AUTHORITY TO TAKE CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT ACTION SUCH AS CLEAN UP IN A BASEMENT ORDERS AGAINST POLLUTERS IF THERE OTHERWISE COMPLYING WITH THEIR POLITICAL PERMITAN WAIVERS IN THIS WITH LIMITS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD'S. AUTHORITY. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE COMMENTS. OF ANY QUESTIONS -- LET'S TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT I MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT I KNOW THERE'S SOME FOLKS WHO WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS WHOLE LOOK AT THAT I WAS RIGHT. BACK UP WITH THAT PLEASE. THIS IS A SERIES OF PROPOSALS -- THAT HAS -- CREATED A SITUATION WHERE EVERYBODY HAS SOMETHING TO BE UNHAPPY ABOUT. THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM AND MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. AND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WATER TAX PART OF THE LANGUAGE. WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WE AGREE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE ACTION THIS YEAR ON THE FUNDING SOLUTION. BUT THIS CAN BE SOLVED WITHOUT A WATER TAX. THE WATER TAX PART OF THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE A LANGUAGE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION LAST YEAR WITH GOVERNOR BROWN ADVANCED. YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WERE HERE LAST YEAR YOU'LL RECALL THAT THE JOINT BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. REJECTED THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL WATER TAX LANGUAGE IN IT. ON THE MERITS THREE QUICK POINTS WE DON'T THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO TAX A RESOURCE THAT'S ESSENTIAL TO LIVING THE STATE DOESN'T TAX YOUR TAP WATER AT HOME IT DOESN'T TAX. YOUR FOOD WHEN YOU GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. ANOTHER POINT IS THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER PROVIDES A RIGHT TO BOTH SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER -- THE TAX IN THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS FOR IT WOULD ADD TO THE COST WATER THE WAY IT'S PROPOSED IT WOULD HAVE ABOUT THREE THOUSAND LOCAL SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE IMPLEMENT IT. SO YOU WOULD HAVE EACH OF THOSE SYSTEMS PAYING TO CHANGE THE SOFTWARE THAT CAN BE FOR SOME SYSTEMS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR SOME MORE SOME LESS. ALSO HIRING A STAFF PERSON IN SOME CASES MORE THAN ONE STAFF PERSON TO IMPLEMENT THE TAX WHEN YOU MULTIPLY THE COST TIMES THREE THOUSAND AGENCIES THE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS SKYROCKET. AND THAT MAKES WATER YOU KNOW IT ADDS TO THE COST OF WATER MAKING IT ON AFFORDABLE. SO FINALLY THE LAST POINT IS THIS WOULD BE THE PRESIDENT FOR A STATE TAX ON WATER IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE'S A BETTER APPROACH SENATOR CAFIERO HAS SB SIX SIX NINE WHICH WOULD CREATE THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST. AND THAT COULD REPLACE THE PROPOSED WATER TAX AWKWARD IN CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION ARE SPONSORING THAT BILL YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE TRUST FROM DANIEL GLASS IT. BUT IN CLOSING AWKWARD WOULD REQUEST THAT THE SUBCOMMITTEE REJECT THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL BECAUSE OF THE WATER TAX PART. THE OTHER PARTS WERE OKAY WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR KEEPING YOUR COMMENTS CONCISE AS WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME TO HEAR YOU ALL. WE DO WANT -- TO ADJOURNED THE MEETING BY ABOUT NOON -- I'LL ASK YOU TO TRY AND KEEP YOUR COMMENT. NOT MORE THAN TWO MINUTES BUT IF YOU KEEP TO WANDER LAST THAT WOULD BE. GREAT OKAY HERE SOMEBODY ELSE -- SAY SOMETHING THAT -- YOU AGREE WITH YOU CAN POINT TO THEM AND AGREE WITH THEM OKAY GREAT DANIEL BLASTED HAYDN WITH CMU WAY. AND YOU KNOW WE'RE IN OPPOSE UNLESS AENDED POSITION AS WELL BECAUSE OF THE PROPOSED WATER TAX THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE SB SIX SIX NINE CREATES A SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST USING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS DURING A BUDGET SURPLUS YEAR -- WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS ABOUT UTILIZING GENERAL FUND FOR SOLUTION AS AN ONGOING SOLUTION BACK TO THE SAFE DRINKING WATER TRUST WOULD HAVE A GENERAL AND AT ONE TIME OR MAYBE OVER TWO YEARS AND FUSION OF GENERAL FUND DOLLARS SO IT WOULD NOT BE ONGOING. IT WOULD JUST BE THAT INITIAL INFUSION UNLIKE THE WATER TAX PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AS TRUST IS NOT ADD TO THE COST OF WATER FOR CALIFORNIANS IT'S PROGRESSIVE INSTEAD OF THE REGRESSIVE WATER TAX AND A PROGRESSIVE FUNDING SOURCE TO US MAKES MORE SENSE. WE AGREED THAT THIS IS A YEAR TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND YOU CAN SOLVE IT WITHOUT A WATER TAX THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE'S THIRTY OR FORTY PEOPLE OUTSIDE OR WHEN THE SO. THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING AND KEEPING YOUR COMMENTS CONCISE YES COMMENTS WILL BE VERY CONCISE A GOOD MORNING HERE IN MEMBERS DIRECT ALL OF HIM HALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES -- I DO WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH US. AQUA AND SAY THAT THE LEAGUE -- DOES OF COURSE SUPPORT -- SAFE DRINKING WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A ISSUE WITH THE TAX PORTION OF THIS TRAILER BILL AND DO REQUEST THAT -- THAT BE TAKEN OUT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING THERESA RIVAGE ON BEHALF OF CERES.

AS A MEANS IN AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOST EFFICIENTLY ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF NITRATE CONTAMINATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN IN SALINAS VALLEY'S. THERE IS NO -- TAKEN AWAY OR REDUCTION OF ENFORCEMENT -- BECAUSE IN ORDER TO ACT IT'S THOSE IN AGRICULTURE HAVE TO BE UNDER OTHER REGULATORY SCHEMES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY GET TO THE GOALS OF REDUCED FERTILIZER -- ACTIVITY IN THE STATE AND CLEANER AQUIFER'S IN THE STATE SO IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE AND WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WHEN THE TIME COMES. HELLO CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RACHEL SMITH I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF FIRST SELF HELP ENTERPRISES WHO IS IN SUPPORT OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND.

THANK YOU SO MUCH WE URGE SUPPORT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE SULLIVAN SALAS WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO SB SIX TWENTY THREE FROM LAST YEAR THAT WOULD CREATE THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND.

AN ESTIMATED ONE IN FOUR SCHOOLS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY SEN UNSAFE DRINKING WATER AND AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED PUBLIC WATER. SYSTEMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T MEET THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER -- WE THINK IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT WORLD THAT THAT IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE THE ADMINISTRATION BOTH THE CHAIR AS WELL AS THE NEW SECRETARIES MR BLUMENFELD. AND MISTER CRAWFORD ON THE ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA PAUSE REALLY QUICKLY -- TO ALLOW MEMBERS WHO MAY NEED TO LEAVE SHORTLY TO ADD ON OF THIS IS A HOLD OPEN SO ENOUGH TO WORRY ABOUT THIS.

GOOD MORNING DONNA SO THAT SOMEONE WATER DISTRICT WE SHARE THE OPINIONS OF AQUA WE OPPOSE THE BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE -- DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF THE WATER TAX. SIR CHAIR MEMBERS DON GILBERT FOR ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE SAFE HARBOR FOR AG. THE SAFE HARBOR FOR AG IS GREAT FOR THEM BUT FOR THE RATE PAYERS WHO WOULD BE MAKING UP THE POTENTIAL DID DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST TO ADDRESS THE NITRATE CONTAMINATION. AND WHAT AG IS PAYING ITS A CRUMBLING HARBOR IT'LL CAST THEIR VOTES A DRAFT AND WE SHOULD CARE ABOUT THEM. TOO IN THE CITY IN THE CITY'S WITH HEAT WITH VERY SUBSTANTIAL COST OF LIVING IN THIS STATE AND HOUSING COSTS THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT FOR SOME PEOPLE EVERY PENNY COUNTS. NO TAX IS IS IS GOING TO BE LOW. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TRICIA GUARANTOR WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE AND THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FIND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ADAM ROBIN WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION ONE BEGIN BY BRIEFLY KNOWLEDGE AND REALLY RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ON THIS ISSUE WE HEARD ABOUT SOME THESE EFFORTS EARLIER TODAY BILLS LIKE AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE CONSIDERED BY THE LODGE THE LATER. LAST YEAR ARE NOW MAKING A DIFFERENCE THERE IS THIS CRITICAL UNMET NEED HOWEVER WE THINK THE ELEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO YOU TODAY BETWEEN THE WATER BOARD PRESENTATION SOME OF STAKEHOLDERS YOU'VE HEARD FROM. THINGS LIKE MAPPING OUT HIGH RISK AREAS IS IMPORTANT SETTING UP A PROGRAM BY WHICH THE WATER BOARD CAN GET THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THESE RESOURCES THOSE RESOURCES IS APPROPRIATE. ON ISSUES LIKE THE FUNDING SOURCE WE AGREE IN A WIDER COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AND KEPT US THE ANYWAY WE DON'T THINK IT TAXES THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS MERION WARMER I REPRESENT THE REAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE A COALITION OF THIRTY SIX COUNTIES AT THIRTY SIX OF THE FIFTY EIGHT MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OUR IN OUR COUNTIES -- AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE FIND AN APPROACH THAT WILL SERVE THEIR NEEDS AS WELL AS MAINTAIN A VIABLE ECONOMIC -- IN ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY WHICH IS ONE OF OUR KEY CORNERSTONES IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC BIGGER IN OUR COUNTIES. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORTED GOVERNOR BROWN'S PROPOSAL AS WE CONTINUE TO DO WITH GOVERNOR NEWS SOME THANK YOU. MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND IN SUPPORT OF THE CREATION OF A SAFE IN A FORMAL DRINKING WATER FIND. CLEAN WATER IS A HUMAN RIGHT AND IS YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM OF THE NORTH THAT GUY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES IN THERE AND THE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS ALLIANCE WE REPRESENT MOSTLY SYSTEMS THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED AROUND THE STATE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POLICY PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED ACROSS THE BOARD ARE -- GOING TO TRIGGER A RACE TO THE BOTTOM. PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT EXT TERMS UNDER PROP ONE AND PROP -- SIXTY EIGHT COMMUNITIES WITH MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RESIDENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS AND SO WE URGE YOU TO ADOPT PROVISIONS THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT -- THAT WOULD ALLOW THESE COMMUNITIES TO APPLY IF THEY MEET A CERTAIN THRESHOLD OF BEING DISADVANTAGED. IT WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ON CONSOLIDATIONS AS WELL. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN AVERT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM IF THE WATER BOARD ADOPTED STRATEGIC COMPLIANCE PLANS WHEN THEY ADOPT NEW REGULATIONS THAT ACTUALLY STIPULATE HOW THEY WILL DEPLOY. THEIR RESOURCES IN TERMS OF GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SYSTEMS THAT CAN AFFORD THE REMEDIES FOR NEW REGULATIONS BECAUSE WE FEAR THAT ONCE YOU ADDRESS THIS LOG OF THREE HUNDRED SYSTEMS THAT ARE CHRONICALLY DISADVANTAGED. YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE HERE NOT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ADDRESSING SOME OF THE FOLKS WILL BE -- TESTIFYING BEHIND ME. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT -- THERE'S A PRACTICAL REASON FOR NOT ADOPTING THE TAX -- FIRST IT HAS TO DO WITH THE YET TO BE COMPLETED -- ASSESSMENT THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS PENDING FOR TWENTY TWENTY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRUST FUND COULD BE SEAT FUNDED AND THEN ADOPTED LATER -- TO MEET THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE STUDY WOODS A STIPULATE SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT THIS IF IT'S AMENDED THANK YOU. BRIAN -- JACKING WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY ARE W. A. IS A JOINT POWERS ASSOCIATION COMPRISED OF TWENTY ONE SACRAMENTO AREA WATER SUPPLIERS. PROVIDING DRINKING WATER TO AND AREA OUR MISSION IS TO RELY WE PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY WATER. ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LEMENTS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER. OUR CONCERN IS THE FUNDING SOURCE BEING A TAX IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO DO THAT TO ACHIEVING RIGHT WATER. WE SUPPORT A SOLUTION WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH COMMENTS OF AUCKLAND SEEM USA WE BELIEVE THAT A VIABLE SOLUTION AS THE TRUST FUND THANKS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S OF PAUL THE MEASURE I'M WITH -- SUBURBAN WATER SYSTEMS -- COMPANY THAT SUPPLIES WATER -- TO CAMINO WAS GIVING A LOS ANGELES SORRY CAMINO WAS CAMINO WOULD YOUR LONG MARADA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- WE STAND FIRMLY AGAINST -- THE WATER TAX -- BECAUSE IN OUR REGIONS THE RESIDENTS -- ARE ALREADY PAYING TO CLEAN UP THE NATION'S LARGEST U. S. EPA SUPERFUND SITE. AND THEN ALSO AS AS WELL AS WHAT ALREADY HAS BEEN STATED -- WE BELIEVE THAT THINGS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO HUMAN WILL BEINGS -- SHOULD NOT BE TAXED -- WE SB SIX SIX NINE BUT BECAUSE THE TRUCKS WERE PROVIDED DURABLE AND ADOPTABLE FUND FUNDING SOURCE TO HELP COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I THINK YOU. GOOD MORNING LINDA NORIEGA WITH CALIFORNIA DOMESTIC WATER COMPANY WE OPERATE A HIGH EFFICIENCY WATER SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES WATER TO THE AREAS OF BRAILLE LÃ  HARPER AND PORTIONS OF THE CITY OF WHITTIER LÃ  MARADA. WE STAND FIRMLY AGAINST THE STATE WIDE WATER TAX AND WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL -- WE LOOK AT IT AS TAX REVENUE THAT'S GOING TO BE REMOVED FROM THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE AND THEN SPREAD NOW LOCATED ACROSS DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE. IN THAT RESPECT WE SUPPORT THE TRUSTFUND THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED BY SENATOR COUPLE YEAH ROLE IN SB SIX SIX NINE BECAUSE WILL PROVIDE AN ADAPTABLE FUNDING SOURCE. FOR THE COMMUNITIES IN THAT DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND PROVIDE THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER -- ALSO IN THAT WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE SAFEST APPROACH BECAUSE THE TRUST PRINCIPLES AND THE NET INCOME IN SEED FUNDING FROM THE STATE BUDGET SURPLUS COULD BE TRANSFERRED. ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO THE STATE DRINKING WATER FUND THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND IF NEEDED THERE COULD BE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING DEVELOPED AS WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

OF CHRONICALLY FEELING WATER SYSTEMS WHICH IS DUE SOMETIME IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ASSESS A TAX ON WATER USERS WITHOUT KNOWING THE COST IS NOT ADVISABLE. AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPTS PRESENTED IN SB SIX SIX NINE BY SENATOR CAPPIELLO. BECAUSE THE TRUST ENVISION WILL PROVIDE A DURABLE AND ADAPTABLE FUNDING SOURCE TO HELP COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO SERVE THEIR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SHOULD BE THOUGHTFUL IN ITS APPROACH AND TAKE A CONCRETE STEP INTO CLEARING THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER.
