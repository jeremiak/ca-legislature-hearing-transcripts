HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN MARCH.

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:29.672
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SHORTFALL OF

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.307
ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.508
OF FUNDING FOR THE ID

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:35.011
DEPOPULATION [inaudible]

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:39.448
WE OF UTILIZED THE REGIONAL

CENTERS AS OUR STAFF HAS STOP

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.319
GAP. FOR EVERYTHING THAT.

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.354
AND THE INSURERS WON'T DO. FOR

01:03:45.421 --> 01:03:47.490
THE ID POPULATION WE HAVE

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:48.658
CASELOADS FULLER SERVICE

THREE TO ONE EVEN OVER A HUNDRED

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:57.333
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE -- BUT

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.435
WE'VE ALREADY TAXED.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.536
THESE REGIONAL CENTERS WITH A

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.806
LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES.

01:04:03.873 --> 01:04:05.474
AND THAT WERE NOT SHORT CHANGING

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:07.009
THIS POPULATION.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.978
OF BECAUSE IT'S JUST THE ONLY

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:12.548
PLACE WE CAN GO -- I HAVE

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.450
WAITING LISTS.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.352
OVER OVER A YEAR.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.588
FOR PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.590
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.058
AND THEY'RE NOT GETTING SERVICES

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:22.892
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.194
PROVIDERS.

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:27.930
WHAT ASSURANCES DO YOU GIVE ME

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:30.700
THAT YOU HAVE THE?

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.902
ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THE

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:33.436
REGIONAL CENTERS HAVE THE

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:36.172
PROVIDERS.

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.907
THAT WE CAN'T GIVE TO THE PEOPLE

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.408
THAT WE ALREADY HAVE IN IN THE

01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:41.711
SYSTEM.

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:44.780
AND WE'RE GONNA NOW ADD MORE.

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:47.883
RESPONSIBILITY AND NEED. FOR

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.218
THESE FOSTER SHOWN WHO'S

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:51.053
SUFFERED FROM BECAUSE I DON'T

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.321
WANT THEM GOING IN THERE.

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.457
AND I WILL NOT ACCEPT A WAITING

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.125
LIST IN THIS SITUATION.

01:04:56.192 --> 01:04:57.760
SO HOW DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.595
THIS IS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.330
REGIONAL CENTERS CURRENTLY HAVE

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:03.699
CHIU INSURER -- TIMELY ACCESS TO

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:06.269
SERVICES AND TO COORDINATE WITH

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.570
A SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.839
AGENCIES AND SO I BELIEVE THAT

01:05:09.905 --> 01:05:11.173
THROUGH THIS EFFORT.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.508
AND THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.644
WITH THE ACROSS THE DEPARTMENTS

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.479
AS WELL AS THE FUNDING FOR THE

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.280
POSITIONS FOR THE REGIONAL

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:20.316
CENTERS THAT ARE LOW IT ALLOWS

01:05:20.383 --> 01:05:20.483
US.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:21.317
THAT.

01:05:21.384 --> 01:05:23.352
BROADER VIEW IF YOU WILL AND THE

01:05:23.419 --> 01:05:25.888
FOCUSED-- RESOURCES TO REALLY

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:28.190
WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:29.625
UNDERSTAND WHERE ARE THOSE GAPS

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:31.227
SOMETIMES THE GAPS ARE JUST AN

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.062
INFORMATION YOU KNOW SO COMING

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:34.664
TOGETHER AND SHARING WHAT'S

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.366
AVAILABLE IN IN VARIOUS PARTS OF

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.267
THE STATE.

01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.269
WHAT'S ON SERVICES MIGHT MEET A

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:42.038
PARTICULAR NEED ONE OF THE

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.006
CHALLENGES WITH REGARDS TO MAYBE

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:46.976
CRISIS SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:47.543
SO I DO BELIEVE THAT THROUGH

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.445
THIS EFFORT -- IT WILL IMPROVE

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:51.714
THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:56.218
TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ARE YOU

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:59.055
TO PLAN WHO HAVE SUSTAIN TRAUMA.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.256
SO WE ALREADY HAVE OTHER ISSUES

01:06:00.323 --> 01:06:02.525
SOLANO COUNTY IS ONE OF MY OF

01:06:02.591 --> 01:06:03.959
COUNTIES IN MY DISTRICT.

01:06:04.026 --> 01:06:06.495
WE DON'T HAVE A PEDIATRIC TRAUMA

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:08.597
CRISIS SITUATION -- BEDS

01:06:08.664 --> 01:06:08.898

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:13.869
IF GOLDEN GATE.

01:06:13.936 --> 01:06:16.572

WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESSES

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:29.518
IN IN A DIFFERENT FASHION WE

01:06:29.585 --> 01:06:32.321
DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITIES.

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.323
IN THE PROVIDER MODEL.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.524
YOU CAN DO IT ADMINISTRATIVELY

01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:37.226
ALL DAY LONG WHO.

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:39.495
BUT I'M GOING OUT AND HITTING

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.330
THE WEEDS IN TALKING TO THE

01:06:41.397 --> 01:06:43.632
PROVIDERS THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:45.101
BLACK.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.102

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.742
THE MISSION.

01:06:52.808 --> 01:06:53.309
BECAUSE THIS ONE COUNTY NOT

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:55.010

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:55.511
TO THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:57.346
CAPABILITY.

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:57.913
YOU'RE GONNA GO TO NORTH BAY

01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.516

YOU CAN GO TO JUVENILE HALL.

01:07:11.627 --> 01:07:15.364
HOW DOES THIS FIX THAT?

01:07:15.431 --> 01:07:15.931
WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:17.299
GOING TO HAVE FIX ALL THE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.868
PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM THROUGH

01:07:18.934 --> 01:07:21.837
THIS EFFORT HOWEVER I DO BELIEVE.

01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:23.139
THAT THROUGH THE VARIOUS

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.907
DEPARTMENTS COMING TOGETHER TO

01:07:24.974 --> 01:07:26.709
TALK ABOUT WHERE THEIR

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.411
BREAKDOWNS IN COMMUNICATION

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:30.379
WHERE THERE ARE -- GAPS IN THE

01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:32.348
SERVICES WHERE WE CAN WORK

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:34.884
TOGETHER TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.519
AND BY US IDENTIFYING WHAT THOSE

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.354
ISSUES ARE FIRST OF ALL I DO

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.356
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:41.991
MORE EXPEDIENT AND BETTER

01:07:42.057 --> 01:07:48.898
SERVICES TO TO THESE INDIVIDUALS.

01:07:48.964 --> 01:07:54.003
I APPRECIATE YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

01:07:54.069 --> 01:07:56.238
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT.

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.540
AND I HAD A BILL I THINK WAS

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.074
LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE THAT

01:07:59.141 --> 01:08:00.676
ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO REQUIRE

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.545
ALL THESE AGENCIES TO TALK.

01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:07.383
AND IT WAS NOT SUPPORTED -- AND

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.884
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ADVANCING

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:10.186
THAT NOW.

01:08:10.252 --> 01:08:12.655
IN A BIT THE COMMUNICATION IS

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.191
KEY RIGHT -- GOOD TO JUST

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.461
UNDERSTANDING THAT.

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:21.530
THE SERVICES AREN'T OUT THERE.

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.132
I AM THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL.

01:08:23.199 --> 01:08:24.700
WE KNOW THAT JUST IN THE ID

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:27.703
POPULATION WITH THE WAITING LIST.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.305
FOR SEVERELY.

01:08:29.371 --> 01:08:31.807
DISABLED CHILDREN OR ADULTS.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.076
WE CAN'T GET THEM HELP.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.244
SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:38.013
ADDRESS THE PROVIDER ISSUE.

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.949
AND MAKING SURE THAT.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.183
GRASS ROOTS IN THE ON THE FIRST

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:42.485
PRIORITY OF ALL OF THESE

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:43.652
AGENCIES.

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.788
IS MAKING SURE THANK YOU CAN TO

01:08:45.855 --> 01:08:46.555
WHICH YOU.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.057
ARE SETTING OUT TO ACCOMPLISH

01:08:48.123 --> 01:08:50.526
WITH.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.994
THE PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE ABLE.

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.929
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE.

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:56.031
THERE'S A HUGE DISPARITY IN NY

01:08:56.098 --> 01:09:00.870
BECAUSE A WE DON'T PAY ENOUGH.

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:02.004
HEY JOE SHOW THE RATE STUDY THAT

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:04.440
WE PROVIDED ONE POINT EIGHT

01:09:04.507 --> 01:09:06.542
BILLION DOLLARS OF THE DEFICIT.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.578
UNDER FUNDING THAT POPULATION.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.013
SO WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO GET

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.282
INTO INVOLVED WITH THIS IF WE'RE

01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:15.117
NOT FUNDING SO.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.418
WE DO NOT HAVE A BACKUP OF

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.787
CONVERSATION BUT I REALLY I

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:20.823
REALLY NEED TO SEE.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.424
FROM A GRASSROOTS PERSPECTIVE

01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:23.959
THE YOU INCREASE.

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.494
THE EFFORTS ON PROVIDERS WHAT

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:27.530
ONE OF THE AND TYPES OF SERVICES

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:29.064
THAT IS VERY SUSTAINABLE ARE OUR

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:30.299
COMMITTEE CRISIS HOMES BECAUSE

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.867
THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT RATE MODEL

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:35.404
AND THIS YEAR WE ARE PROPOSING.

01:09:35.471 --> 01:09:37.306
TO EXTEND THOSE TWO CHILDREN AND

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:40.442
WE ALSO ARE EXPANDING OUR

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.478
SERVICES TO CHILDREN WITH

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:44.113
REGARDS TO THE STATE OPERATED

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.514
ACUTE CRISIS SERVICES.

01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:47.116
WE HAVE OUR MOBILE CRISIS

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:48.784
SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:50.553
WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT

01:09:50.619 --> 01:09:51.954
WHERE THOSE GAPS ARE AND WHAT

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:55.591
ADICIONAL MODELS WE NEED TO

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:57.059
CREATE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS.

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:57.693
SHE THAT BUT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

THE THE TEMPER POSITIONS ARE.

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:07.535
MY CONCERN IS THAT.

01:35:07.601 --> 01:35:09.403
YOU ARE CORRECT WE DON'T HAVE WE

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:10.571
CAN'T COUNT ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:13.007
BY HOW DO YOU RECRUIT FOLKS --

01:35:13.074 --> 01:35:15.676
IF THE POSITIONS ARE NOT GOING

01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:17.478
TO BE -- I'M GOING WE ARE WE ARE

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:19.213
CURRENTLY HIRING PEOPLE IS

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.415
PERMANENT -- THERE ARE THERE ARE

01:35:21.482 --> 01:35:23.551
COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING PROGRAM --

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.252
WHICH IN MOST OF THESE POSITIONS

01:35:25.319 --> 01:35:27.188
ARE NOT ALL OF THEM -- THE

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.656
PEOPLE WHO DO THE INSPECTIONS

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.291
THERE IS -- CONSIDERABLE

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.792
TURNOVER AND THAT'LL POPULATIONS

01:35:31.859 --> 01:35:33.594
WERE HIRING THEM IS PERMANENT

01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:35.796
WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT -- THE

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:37.364
FUNDING WILL CONTINUE BUT FOR

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.467
MISSION THERE IT TAKES CARE YES

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:41.635
PEOPLE RETIRE PEOPLE LEAVE -- SO

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:42.837
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE WON'T BE

01:35:42.903 --> 01:35:44.638
ANY PROBLEM WITH IT ZORBING THAT

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:46.273
ENDED THOSE ADDITIONAL STAFF SO

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.241
WE ARE HARD TO MISS PERMANENT

01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:49.076
POSITIONS OKAY SO THAT WE WON'T

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:50.111
HAVE THOSE ISSUES AND THEN I

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:51.745
KNOW WE'VE DISCUSSED THE ANNUAL

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:53.147
INSPECTIONS AND RIGHT NOW THERE

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:54.648
IT'S EVERY THREE YEARS -- WHAT'S

01:35:54.715 --> 01:35:56.450
STOPPING US FROM DOING IT EVERY

01:35:56.517 --> 01:35:58.486
SINGLE YEAR CHILD CARE SERVICE

01:35:58.552 --> 01:35:59.887
PROVIDERS ARE VERY CRITICAL

01:35:59.954 --> 01:36:01.455
OBVIOUSLY AND IT'S A VERY

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:04.091
DANGEROUS -- WELL IT SAYS.

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:08.229
THE OVERSIGHT IS CRITICAL -- I

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:09.363
DID SEE THE RESULT I'M RUNNING A

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:12.066
BILL ON CHILD CARE SERVICES AND

01:36:12.133 --> 01:36:13.801
THERE IS A PARENT THE CONTEST TO

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.536
FIND SAID THAT THERE WAS.

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:17.972
AN INCIDENT THAT HER SON'S --

01:36:18.038 --> 01:36:20.808
DAYCARE OR CHILD CARE -- PLACE

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:23.744
AND HE END UP HOSPITALIZED AND

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:25.713
HEMORRHAGED IN YOU KNOW A LOT OF

01:36:25.779 --> 01:36:28.616
ISSUES AND IF WE INSPECT EVERY

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:29.650
THREE YEARS.

01:36:29.717 --> 01:36:31.519
YOU KNOW HOW IS THAT BEING

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:33.120
MONITORED I MEAN IN MY OPINION

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.624
IN OF THOSE POSITIONS LIKE --

01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.626
THE OLD FOLKS.

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:41.495
HOMES SHOULD HAVE A REGULAR

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:43.497
VISIT JUST SO THAT WE ARE AWARE

01:36:43.564 --> 01:36:46.267
OF ANY ISSUES BECAUSE THESE ARE.

YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLD PEOPLE NOT

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:48.636
YET AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING

01:36:48.702 --> 01:36:50.471
OBVIOUSLY BUT MY POINT IS THAT

01:36:50.538 --> 01:36:51.939
THESE ARE VULNERABLE KIDS AND

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:53.274
SOME OF THEM.

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.976
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TO SPEAK SOUL

01:36:56.043 --> 01:36:58.179
CAN WE TALK ABOUT POSSIBLY IN

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.346
THE FUTURE.

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:01.348
OR SOON SOONER RATHER THAN LATER

01:37:01.415 --> 01:37:03.817
TO HAVE ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AS

01:37:03.884 --> 01:37:06.487

WILL BE ANNUAL FOR THE NEXT THE

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.359
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND BY

01:37:12.426 --> 01:37:13.761
PUTTING ON IMPERIAL THAT THE

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:20.801
LEGISLATURE'S ASKING RIGHT BUT

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.269
IT'S TEMPORARY FIND NG.

01:37:22.336 --> 01:37:23.270

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:25.039
CREATIVE SO THAT.

01:37:25.105 --> 01:37:25.639
THE WAY YOU'RE BEING CREATIVE

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:26.173
YOU KNOW AND AND USING THE

01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:26.807

THESE FOLKS HOW CAN WE LEVERAGE.

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:30.444
FINDING NOW TO MAKE THAT A

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:32.846
PERMANENT.

01:37:32.913 --> 01:37:34.448
I ASIAN STEP ONLY FOR THE NEXT

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.550
FEW YEARS ONE OF THE THINGS THE

01:37:36.617 --> 01:37:37.318
WORKING.

01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:38.719
MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:37:38.786 --> 01:37:40.421
BEEN DOING AND COMMUNITY CARE

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:41.021
LICENSING OVER THE LAST FEW

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:43.257
YEARS HAS BEEN REALLY TO REBUILD

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.925
THE FOUNDATION OF LICENSING.

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:47.061
AND TO WHICH HAD BEEN KIND OF

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:48.529
DECIMATED DURING THAT THE THAT

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:50.364
THE RECESSIONARY TIMES AND TO

01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:51.865
TRY AND DEVELOP NEW WAYS OF

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.601
DOING BUSINESS THAT CAN MAKE US

01:37:53.667 --> 01:37:58.606
MORE EFFICIENT AND STILL MORE --

01:37:58.672 --> 01:37:59.640
FUNDING OR QUALITY -- WHEN WE'RE

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:01.141
DOING OUR INSPECTIONS SO WE'VE

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:02.776
DEVELOPED A NEW INSPECTION TOOL

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:03.978
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT'S

01:38:04.044 --> 01:38:05.613
GOING TO ALLOW US TO DO A BETTER

01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:07.248
MORE THOROUGH JOB WHEN WE'RE

01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:09.516
DOING INSPECTIONS INSTEAD OF THE

01:38:09.583 --> 01:38:11.652
WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IT NOW --

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.054
WHICH IS A A FAIRLY SHORT KEY

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:16.557
INDICATOR TOOL WE'RE MOVING TO A

01:38:16.624 --> 01:38:18.158
MORE IN DEPTH.

01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.494
TOOL THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU HAVE A

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:22.229
PROBLEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:24.198
TO DRILL DOWN ON THE AREA MORE

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:26.467
THAT PROBLEM OCCURS A LOT MORE

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:27.801
MORE QUICKLY FOR HOPING THAT IT

01:38:27.868 --> 01:38:29.270
THAT OVER TIME AS WE DEVELOPED

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:30.838
AND WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THESE

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:31.772
TOOLS NOW.

01:38:31.839 --> 01:38:33.207
THAT THAT WILL MAKE US MORE

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:34.408
EFFICIENT IN OUR ABILITY TO DO

01:38:34.475 --> 01:38:36.110
IT THE MORE EFFICIENT THE WE CAN

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:38.045
BE THE MORE TIME WE FREE UP SO

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:39.847
IF THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.415
WE CAN SEE THAT EFFICIENCY

01:38:41.482 --> 01:38:42.850
ACTUALLY COMING TO FRUITION IN

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:44.051
SEVERAL YEARS.

01:38:44.118 --> 01:38:45.386
THAT MIGHT HAVE SYSTEMS IN YOU

01:38:45.452 --> 01:38:46.220
KNOW SORT OF FREEING UP

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.755
ADDITIONAL TIME TO DO MORE

01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:50.591
INSPECTIONS -- IN ADDITIONALLY

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.626

ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDERS. TO HELP

01:38:57.064 --> 01:38:58.699
THEM BE IN COMPLIANCE INSTEAD OF

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.501
HAVING TO SITE FOR ONCE

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:01.735
SOMETHING IS ALREADY GONE WRONG

01:39:01.802 --> 01:39:03.237
WE'RE TRYING TO DO A LOT MORE IN

01:39:03.304 --> 01:39:04.338
PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:39:04.405 --> 01:39:05.673
TO HELP THE COMPLIANCE.

01:39:05.739 --> 01:39:07.374
THAT HELPS WITH HAVING FEWER

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.710
COMPLAINTS -- BECAUSE BY BEING

01:39:09.777 --> 01:39:11.478
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FACILITY

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.514
