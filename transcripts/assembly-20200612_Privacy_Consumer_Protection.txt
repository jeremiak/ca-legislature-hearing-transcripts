THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US- WE IMPLEMENT- METHODS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHILE ALSO BEING MINDFUL AND RESPECTFUL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WE ALL FACE. WITH THAT I WILL NOW TURN TO THE MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA PASSED THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE CONSUMER PRIVACY LAW IN THE NATION. NAMELY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OR THE CCPA WHICH BROUGHT LE GIVES CONSUMERS TO RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT INFORMATION COMPANIES COLLECT ABOUT THEM. THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION DELETED. AMONG OTHER THINGS. THE CITY PA REPRESENTS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MANY OF WHOM ARE HERE IN THE ROOM TODAY. IT STARTED OUT AS A BALLOT INITIATIVE PROPOSED BY MISTER ALISTAIR MAKE TAGGERT. WHICH ULTIMATELY BECAME AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE CO AUTHOR BY MYSELF SENATOR HERTZBERG HAS SENATOR DOT. THE BALLOT INITIATIVE BEFORE US TODAY TO SEE P. R. E. A. WOULD AMEND THE CCPA IN A NUMBER OF WAYS INCLUDING. BY INCORPORATING THE CONCEPT OF DATA MINIMIZATION. BY REQUIRING THAT ANY SUBSEQUENT LAWS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT AMEND THE ACT TO BE IN FURTHERANCE OF PRIVACY OR OTHERWISE BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. AND BY CREATING A PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY IN STATE GOVERNMENT TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS AND MANY OF THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS PUT IN PLACE BY THE CCP ACT. I WILL GO INTO MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE MEASURE ANYMORE AT THIS POINT. AND THAT'S OF ALL PANEL SIDE HERE TO DO BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT I SEE THE MAIN OBJECTIVE FOR THIS HERE. UNLIKE LEGISLATIVE BILLS WHICH GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF PUBLIC HEARINGS BALLOT INITIATIVES DO NOT ALWAYS ENJOY THE SAME DEGREE OF PUBLIC DEBATE. THE LEGISLATURE HAS A STATUTORY OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO SECTION NINE ZERO THREE FOUR OF THE ELECTIONS CO TO HOLD JOINT HEARINGS ON INITIATIVES. THAT HAVE OBTAINED 25% OF THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES REQUIRED. TO QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR ALL THIS COMMITTEE WAS INFORMED THAT THE INITIAL HIT THE 25% THRESHOLD. AND WE ARE THEREFORE REQUIRED TO HOLD A HEARING AT LEAST ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION OR BY JUNE TWENTY FIFTH. WHY PUBLIC DEBATE ON THESE MEASURES IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT IT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL ON A MEASURE ASK COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPLEX AS THIS ONE. AS OUR PANELISTS A WE SPEAK TODAY I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE PRACTICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE AND THE CCPA IN TERMS OF THE EFFECT ON CONSUMER PRIVACY AND WORKABILITY FOR BUSINESS. THIS IS. I WAS SEE WHAT CLEAR AS A CONCEPT OFTEN BECOMES COMPLICATED AS A PRACTICAL MATTER. I HOPE THIS HEARING CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL TO VOTERS WISHING TO MAKE AN EDUCATED DECISION ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR INITIATIVE GOAL INTO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION. MY CONCERN IS ALWAYS. IS TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S AWFUL MANNER THAT- CO EXIST WITH OTHER RIGHTS AFFORDED TO THE STATIONS% RESIDENTS THE NEED FOR THIS PROTECTION HAS BEEN AMPLIFIED BY THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND PROTEST AS WE SEE CIVIL LIBERTIES BEING COMPROMISED ON A NUMBER OF FRONTS AND WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE ENTERS AND I'M PRESIDENT OF FISCAL CRISIS CAUSING CUTS TOO MANY OF OUR VITAL SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. TO THAT END I WILL BE ASKING AND I DO ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUE SO MANY OF WHOM WILL BE JOINING US LATER TO ASK QUESTIONS TO THE VARIOUS PANELISTS TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. SO SINCE I DON'T SEE ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES I THINK I'M GONNA RESERVE MIGHT. OUR COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES LATER ON. AND UP AT THIS TIME- I LIKE TO START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL. AND OUT- TODAY WE HOW FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MISS AND NEED A LEAD. I BELIEVE SHE'S ON VIDEO TODAY. TO HELP US TESTIFIED SO IT THIS TIME LET US. THE. TURN TO MISLI.

AND I MAY EVEN INVITE HIM TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS IF HE SO DESIRES WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE THE VIDEO AT THIS POINT SENATOR DOT TO. WELCOME WELCOME TO OUR HEARING TODAY. RECEIVE YOUR OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A- GRAHAM NORTON YEAH YOUR TOPIC FOR ME POLICY AREA FOR ME AND- FOR THE LEGISLATURE I THINK FOR THE PEOPLE THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS AND- SO SORRY THAT. WE ARE IN THE SITUATION WE'RE IN EVERYBODY'S GOT TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE- O HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT WE'LL GET THROUGH IT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AGAIN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR I CAN YOU HEAR ME HI YES WE COULD HEAR YOU ALL I COULD WE COULD SEE YOU NOW OH OKAY GREAT THINK HUNKA MISLI. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WERE OR ALL ADAPTING TO THIS I NEW TECHNOLOGY SO- VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE- ANNUALLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR HEARING TODAY- WE WILL BE PROVIDING AND REVIEW. THE PROPOSED CHANGES MADE BY THIS MEASURE AS WELL AS THE FISCAL IMPACTS IT COULD HAVE. WE WILL BE USING THE HANDOUT WHICH I BELIEVE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO YOU IN YOUR PACKETS- AS A GUIDE FOR COMMENTS IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE AS WELL AS THE ONLY A WEBSITE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE FIRST LET'S START OFF WITH THE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE ALLEY ROLL LA ROLE IN THE PROCESS- BEFORE INITIATIVES CAN GO OUT TO BE CIRCULATED FOR SIGNATURES. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT OUR OFFICE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PREPARE A JOINT IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS ON THE INITIATIVE AND IT DOES INCLUDE AND ESTIMATES OF THE FISCAL IMPACTS I COULD HAVE ON THE STATE. AND LOCAL GOVENMENTS. A SUMMARY OF THOSE FISCAL OF FACTS ARE THEN INCLUDED WITH THE POSITION THAT CIRCULATED FOR SIGNATURE. FOR THOSE INITIATIVES THAT COLLECT SUFFICIENT SIGNATURES ON THE QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT OUR OFFICE PROVIDE IMPARTIAL ANALYSES OF ALL OF THEM AND THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE STATEWIDE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE AND IT DOES INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE AS WELL. AS AN OVERVIEW OF ITS FISCAL A FAX. AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING THOSE MATERIALS FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY BALLOTS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF YOUR HAND OUT- WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY POINTS OF BACKGROUND IN OF EXISTING LAW. THAT ARE TOUCHED ON BY THE MEASURE SO AT THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AWARE OF- BUSINESSES COLLECT. DATA FROM VARIOUS SOURCES AND USE IT FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES. CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA AND COLLECT PERSONAL DATA SUCH AS MEANS AN INTERNET ACTIVITY ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS. THESE ARE GENERALLY BUSINESS SAYS THAT EARN MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUE. THAT BUY SELL OR SHARE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES THE PERSONAL DATA A FIFTY THOUSAND OR MORE CONSUMERS HOUSEHOLDS FOR DEVICES ANNUALLY. OR THAT AND 15% OR MORE OF THEIR ANNUAL REVENUES FROM SELLING PERSONAL DATA. AS I MENTIONED THERE REQUIRED TO- MEET SPECIFIC DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS FOR EXAMPLE BUSINESSES ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO TELL CONSUMERS IF THEY COLLECT OR SELL PERSONAL DATA AND WHAT THEY'LL USE THAT FOR. THEIR ALSO REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN PRIVACY RIGHTS SUCH AS ALLOWING CONSUMERS TO REQUEST FREE REPORTS ON THE PERSONAL DATA THAT IS COLLECTED AND SOLD BY THE BUSINESS ABOUT THEM. RUMORS ARE ASO ABLE TO TELL BUSINESSES TO DELETE OR TEN NOT SELL THEIR PERSONAL DATA. FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO CHOOSE TO MAKE USE OF THOSE RIGHTS BUSINESSES ARE PROHIBITED FROM TREATING THEM DIFFERENTLY SUCH AS CHARGING THEM A DIFFERENT PRICE TO PROVIDING A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF SERVICE. IF THE BUSINESS FAILS TO ADDRESS A VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS CALIFORNIA DOJ THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAN SEEK PENALTIES OF UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION OR UP TO SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER INTENTIONAL VIOLATION. THE PENALTY REVENUES ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE STATE'S CONSUMER PRIVACY FUNDS. AND IT'S TO FIRST BE USED TO OFFSET STATE COURT IN THE OJ COSTS RELATED TO ENFORCING THESE LAWS BEFORE THEY CAN BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AS DESIGNATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. TURNING TO PAGE THREE OF YOUR HANDS OUT. BUSINESSES ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MEET DATA BREACH REQUIREMENTS THIS INCLUDES TAKING REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT CONSUMER AND- MISSION AS WELL AS INFORMING PEOPLE IF THEIR DATA WAS ACCESS IN A BREACH. AGES OF CERTAIN PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN RESULT IN PENALTIES OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER CONSUMER PER EVENT OR ACTUAL DAMAGES WHICHEVER IS GREATER. A CONSUMER THAT'S AFFECTED BY THIS TYPE OF REACH CAN SEEK THESE PENALTIES IF THE BUSINESS FAILS TO ADDRESS THE VIOLATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS DOJ IS ALSO ABLE TO SEEKPENALTIES AND THEN SOME OF THIS PENALTY REVENUE COULD BE DEPOSITED INTO THE CONSUMER PRIVACY FOUGHT. AT A HIGH LEVEL CALIFORNIA DOJ IS GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING CONSUMER PRIVACY- AND DATA BREACH LAWS AND REALLY DO THIS IN TWO WAYS- ONE WAY IS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULAR REGULATIONS- TO PROVIDE BUSINESSES CONSUMER GUIDE HOW TO COMPLY. BUT ALSO- BY FILING LAWSUITS INTRO CHORDS ARE PROSECUTING CRIMES IN THE AREA. TURNING TO PAGE HAND OUT WE'RE GOING TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE PROPOSAL A NUMBER OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PROPOSAL TAKE A FACT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT THERE ARE FEW COMPONENTS SUCH AS THE CREATION OF THE NEW AGENCY WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT SHORTLY I WOULD GO INTO EFFECT UPON VOTER APPROVAL. THE CHANGES ARE MADE BY THIS PROPOSED MEASURE REALLY FALL INTO FOUR KEY AREA. THE FIRST IS THAT IT CHANGES EXISTING CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY LAWS AND IT DOES SO IN A COUPLE WAYS. IT CHANGES BUSINESSES I NEED TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME CASES CERTAIN BUSINESS. I KNOW WHAT YOU TO COMPLY- FOR EXAMPLE BUSINESSES THAT BUY OR SELL PERSONAL DATA OF BETWEEN. FIFTY THOUSAND TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSUMERS FOR HOUSEHOLD ANNUALLY WHEN I WANT TO COMPLY IN OTHER CASES IT'S POSSIBLE THAT AT YOUR BUSINESS MAY NEED TO COME. IT ALSO EXPANDS EXISTING CONSUMER DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS REQUIRING NOTIFICATION TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES SHARE DATA. BUT IT ALSO EASES REQUIREMENTS OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES- SO CERTAIN BUSINESSES WOULD BE ABLE TO NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER VERY SPECIFIC CONDITIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE- BUSINESSES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DELETE STUDENT GRADES ARE EDUCATIONAL. DATA THE SECOND MAJOR AREA OF CHANGES THAT THE PROPOSED MEASURE WOULD PROVIDE NEW DATA PRIVACY RIGHTS CONSUMERS WILL BE ABLE TO DIRECT BUSINESSES TO NOT SHARE THEIR DATA TO CORRECT DATA AS WELL AS- TO USE THAT SENSITIVE DATA SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS- HEALTH DATA FOR ONLY THE PURPOSE OF PROVIDING THE REQUESTED GOOD OR SERVICE. OR FOURTEEN BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICE. THE THIRD AREA IS THAT THIS PROPOSAL MAKES CHANGES TO THE EXISTING PENALTY STRUCTURE- SO FOR EXAMPLE. VIOLATIONS THE MEASURE AUTHORIZES- A PENALTY OF UP TO SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR VIOLATIONS OF MINOR RIGHT. BUT IT ALSO ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO AVOID PENALTIES BY ADDRESSING VIOLATIONS WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. ARE TURNING FIVE OF YOUR HAND OUT IT ALSO LIMITS THE USE OF CONSUMER PRIVACY REVENUES FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN CONSUMER PRIVACY- SO AFTER COURT COSTS THE STATE DOJ COSTS ARE TAKING CARE OF THE MEASURE WOULD THEN REQUIRE 91% OF THE RATHER BE INVESTED BY THE STATE. EARNINGS WERE BE TRANSFERRED TO THE GENERAL FUND FOR IT USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THE REMAINING 9% WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC EDUCATION RELATED TO CONSUMER PRIVACY AS WELL AS TO ADDRESS- FRAUD THAT RESULTED FROM DATA BREACHES. THE FOURTH AND FINAL ARIEL WAS ALREADY REFERENCE BY MISTER CHAIR- WHICH IS THE NEW MEASURE CREATES A NEW STATE AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY TO OVERSEE AND ENFORCE THE STATE'S CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS. THE NEW AGENCY WOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF RESPONSIBILITIES RANGING FROM INVESTIGATING AND IF YOU CAME VIOLATIONS ASSESSING PENALTY IS TO DEVELOPING REGULATIONS THE AGENCIES DECISIONS RELATED SIT COMPLAINTS AGAINST BUSINESSES ARE ASSESSMENTS OF PENALTIES. WOULD BE- ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW BY THE TRIAL COURT. SOME OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NEW AGENCY IT WOULD HAVE WOULD BE SHIFTED FROM DOJ MOST NOTABLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS. HOWEVER DOJ WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE CRIMES AND FILE LAWSUITS AND TRIAL COURTS AND MOST NOTABLY THIS MEASURE SPECIFICALLY SAYS THAT DOJ'S INVESTIGATION AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WHAT HAVE PRIORITY OVER THAT OF THE AGENCY. TURNING TO THE FINAL PAGE OF YOUR HAND OUT WE'LL TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE FISCAL A FAX. THIS MEASURE WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE STATE COSTS AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY ON STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE IMPACT WILL REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW CONSUMERS BUSINESSES AND STATE ND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPOND TO THE MEASURE AND SO IT IS A BIT AND CERTAIN SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S UNCLEAR HOW BUSINESSES WILL CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH FULL OF THE PROPOSED MEASURE. AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS THAT WILL BE ASSESSED AND INVESTIGATED AND EDUCATE. SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE IDENTIFIED THREE. FAX THE FIRST IS INCREASED STATE COSTS FOR THE NEW AGENCY. THE MEASURE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THAT AT LEAST TEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND BE PROVIDED ANNUALLY IS TO SUPPORT THE AGENCY'S OPERATIONS. DEPENDING ON HOW THE AGENCY CARE OUT ITS RESPONSIBILITIES. THE ACTUAL COST COULD POTENTIALLY BE HIGHER. THE SECOND EFFECT IS INCREASED STATE DOJ A COURT COSTS- DOJ WORKLOAD COULD INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT CHOOSES TO INVESTIGATE AND FILE MORE CASES. SOME OF THIS INCREASE WORK WHAT LOAD WOULD BE OFFSET- EITHER PARTIALLY OR FULLY BY THE SHIFT AND RESPONSIBILITIES FROM DOJ- TO THE NEW AGENCY. IN A SIMILAR WAY COURT WORKLOAD COULD INCREASE IF MORE CASES ARE FILED IN COURT. THE COSTS OF THE INCREASED WORKLOAD WOULD DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE INITIATED AS WELL AS THE TYPES OF CASES THAT ARE FILED IN THE QUIRK. IN TOTAL THE STATE COSTS ARE NOT LIKELY TO EXCEED THE LOW MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY SOME OR ALL OF THESE COSTS WOULD BE OFFSET BY THE INCREASED REVENUES- FROM HANDLES HE'S- TEST ON BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE THE LAW. THE FINAL AFFECT IS RELATED TO TAX REVENUES IN THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THEIR- AND SO ON THE ONE HAND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TAX REVENUES COULD DECREASE. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE COMPLIANCE COSTS THAT REDUCE BUSINESS PROFITS THAT COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN TAX REVENUES. HOWEVER ON THE OTHER HAND- TAX REVENUES COULD INCREASE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS LOSE LAST MONEY FROM LESS SEVERE OR FEWER DATA BREACHES. IT COULD RESULT IN CONSUMERS SPENDING MORE ON TAXABLE GOODS OR BUSINESSES EARNING WATER AND THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT TAX REVENUE. THE TOTAL THAT PACKED HOWEVER IS- UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME. SO WITH THAT WILL CONCLUDE OUR COMMENTS WE WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MISLI FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ARE WE GONNA HOW FAR QUESTIONS FOR YOU AT A LATER TIME SO IF I COULD ASK YOU TO. STAY WITH US- UNTIL THAT HAPPENS THANK YOU AGAIN SO NEXT SO- WE'LL HEAR FROM THE INITIATIVE OF. A PROPONENT MR ALISTAIR MATAK SO MISTER MACAQUE. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I MISSED YOUR AT.

WHAT PEOPLE SAID WHY NOW YOU KNOW NOW'S NOT THE TIME FOR ANOTHER INITIATIVE- C. C. P. A.'S IT'S GETTING DIGESTED MY ANSWER THE IS THE OPPOSITE NOW IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME FOR ANOTHER INITIATIVE AND THEIR NUMBER REASONS SO ONE OF THEM IS GOING TO SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO CONGRESS. THE LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT THE DC A NUMBER OF TIMES AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY LEGISLATORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE ISLAND BOTH HOUSES OF TELLING THE SAME STORY. BUT FOR A QUARTER CENTURY BUSINESS IS BEEN IN THEIR OFFICE SAYING DON'T YOU DARE PASSED PRIVACY LEGISLATION LET US SELF REGULATION IS THE BEST REGULATION- YOU'D UNDERSTAND- THIS COMPLICATED.

AND NOT HURT OR SOMETIMES IMPROVE PRIVACY THE SAME TIME. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND THEN FINALLY I THINK LOOK THIS IS IMPORTANT- TO IT TO COLLEGE. ONE OF THE OPTIONS WE HAVE HERE IS TO SET A BASELINE POLICY FOR PRO FOR PRIVACY IN THE STATE GOING FORWARD. RIGHT NOW THERE'S A REAL CHAMP IS A PRIVACY TO THEM IN THIS ROOM. IN THIS BUILDING IN THIS LEGISLATURE BUT TERM LIMITS WILL COME. AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE HERE.

THE OTHER THING IS AS AS- WAS ALLUDED TO EARLIER WE CREATE. A NEW AGENCY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND NEXT PLEASE.

I THINK WE'VE IMPROVE BOTH A DRAMATICALLY AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IF THIS PASSES IN NOVEMBER IT'LL BE BEST IN CLASS IN THE IN THE WORLD WILL BE THEMOST EFFECTIVE PRICE LEGISLATION WORLD. NEXT PLEASE. SO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK ABILITY ENHANCEMENTS AGAIN THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE WE THINK WE CAN IMPROVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW AND NOT HER PRIVACY. NEXT PLEASE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE DEFINITION WE HAD IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- IN THE ORIGINAL ISSUED OF- FOR BUSINESS. AND THAT IS GOING UP FROM FIFTY THOUSAND RECORDS YEAR TO BUSINESSES THAT MONETIZE COLLECT A HUNDRED THOUSAND RECORDS A YEAR. AND WERE. RIGHT NOW IT'S THERE'S A THE- TERM RECEIVES OR SHARES FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. TAKING THAT OUT AND ASSIST YOU TO BE CLEAN BUYER CELL BECAUSE WHAT. WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS COMPANIES THAT BUY AND SELL YOUR INFORMATION- AND SO WHAT THIS WILL DO IS THE PROBLEM NOT THE MOM AND POPS THE SMALL LITTLE. CONTRACTOR SO WE'RE GOING AFTER THE BUSINESSES AND WE'RE TRYING TO- FURTHER REFINED THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. BY THE WAY YOUR SMALL LITTLE BIT BROKER YOU ARE COVERED. NEXT PLEASE. SERVICE WHAT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A OF A WIN WIN SO- THINK OF A SERVICE PROVIDER THINK OF IT LIKE IT'S A BANK WITH A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX YOU KNOW YOU GO TO CITY DEPOSIT BOX YOU DON'T WANT THE BANK TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE WELL THE CLOUD PROVIDERS ARE MUCH LIKE THAT YOUR BUSINESS YOU HOST YOUR YOUR SERVICES ON THE CLOUD- THE COVER LETTER DOESN'T ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE YOUR INTERNAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS EVERYTHING OR YOU WANT THE CLUB BETTER TO SEE THEM. RIGHT NOW IN THE LAW THE REGULATION HAVE ADDRESS THIS BUT RIGHT NOW IN THE LAW. YOU CAN GO TO A CLUB PROVIDERS SAY WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT ME UP TO IS A W. S. HERE. AND THEY WOULD SOMEHOW HAVE TO REACH INTO ALL THE BUSINESSES THEY HOST TO FIND OUT. YOU KNOW IF YOUR CUSTOMER AND WHAT THEY KNOW ABOUT YOU THAT'S BAD FOR. THE BUSINESS THAT'S TERRIBLE FOR YOU THE CONSUMER BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT LEVEL. OF KNOWLEDGE THAT THAT THAT THAT BUSINESSES FOR THE BIG BROTHER. SO THIS IS A WIN WIN- AND WE WOULD- SAY SEEM TO BE THE SERVICE BETTER HAS TO. ASSIST THE BUSINESS YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH. NEXT PLEASE. NOW THIS ONE I WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON- BECAUSE THIS IS- THERE'S A LOT OF CONFUSION OUT THERE ABOUT THIS- THIS PARTICULAR ENHANCEMENT. SO RIGHT NOW. UNDERSEA CPA IF YOU OPT OUT OF THE SALE OF YOUR IN. A BUSINESS CAN TAKE ACTION THEY CAN CHARGE YOU SOMETHING IT CAN DIMINISH YOUR SERVICE- IT HAS TO TELL YOU THE CONSEQUENCE HAS TO BE REASONABLE IT CAN'T BE ON JUST USER IS CAN'T BE COURSE OF THE CAN'T SORT OF FORCE YOU INTO SELLING INFORMATION BUT THEY CAN. HAVE A CONSEQUENCE NOW THIS IS BEEN A REALLY CONTENTIOUS PARTY CPA A LOT OF ADVOCATES HERE BECAUSE THEY SAY THIS IS PAY FOR PRIVACY. AND AS WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS LAST FALL WE WERE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT WOULD BUT YOU KNOW WHAT REPAIRS WE COULD IMPROVE AND ONE IDEA THAT CAME UP WAS LOOK HAVE ANOTHER PATH. BECAUSE BUSINESSES DON'T LIKE HAVING TO PUT A DO NOT SELL BUTTON HAVE ANOTHER PATH FOR BUSINESS THE DON'T WANT TO DO NOT SELL BUTTON. WHERE IF YOU SHOW UP OR WHEN YOU SHOW UP WITH YOUR DO NOT SELL SIGNAL FROM YOUR BROWSER YOUR PHONE. THE BUSINESS CAN'T TAKE ANY ACTION CAN'T CHARGE YOU MORE CAN'T RETALIATE CAN'T DIMINISH YOUR SERVICE CAN'T HAVE A POP UP SAYING YOU KNOW THE WORLD'S GOING TO AND IF YOU DON'T LET US AT SELL YOUR DATA. THE IMPORTANT PART WHERE THE IF YOU CAN IS. THE BUSINESS HAS TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER DOOR IN BOTH CASES THE BUSINESS MUST. RESPECT THE DO NOT SELL SIGNAL I WANT TO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT AGAIN IF PEOPLE. WERE FALLING ALONG BABIES OUT THERE WHO THAT IS A PRIVACY EXPERT IF YOU LOOK AT SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT ONE THIRTY FIVE BE. ANY BE SAYS THE BUSINESS. IN THE SECOND PATH HAS TO RESPECT YOUR SIGNAL- THE DO NOT SELL SIGNAL AND HE SAYS. IT ALSO HAS TO RESPECT THE SIGNAL IF YOU HIRE SERVICE TO DO IT. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M CONVINCED WE'VE DONE IS CREATE A PRIVACY INDUSTRY. A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO THIS HIMSELF A LOT OF PEOPLE ALSO WANT INSTALL AN APP OR HAVE A GLOBAL SITTING ON THEIR PHONE. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR. THERE IS NO GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD HERE WE ARE. THAT WE ARE KEEPING THE CPA CONSTRUCT IN THIS AND WE'RE OFFERING ANOTHER. PATH WHERE THE BUSINESS DOES GET TO NOT HAVE TO DO NOT SELL. BUTTON BUT IN RETURN CAN'T CHARGE MORE. CAN'T HAVE ANY CONSEQUENCE TO THE CUP. THE CONSUMER WHO SHOWS UP WITH THE DO NOT SELL SIGNAL I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS ENHANCEMENT BECAUSE I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IS BROWSER EXTENSIONS AND GLOBAL PHONE SETTINGS ARE GONNA BECOME UBIQUITOUS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO. ENABLE THEM AND THE BUSINESSESARE GOING TO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO DO NOT SELL BUTTON BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO INDICATE THEY ARE SELLING.

I DO HOWEVER HAVE AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT IT SURVIVED THE TEST OF TIME. AND WHEN I FOR CONSTITUTIONAL. FETTERS ONLY TO DO SOMETHING. I THINK I'M GONNA I'M GONNA LISTEN TO THEM. WE MADE THIS IS NARROW IS WE COULD. THE BEAUTY IS IF THERE'S SOME CASE LAW IN THE FUTURE THE CHANGES. AND TURNS OUT IT CAN BE NARROWER FOR GUESS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS A LAW NARROWING THIS EXEMPTION. SO AGAIN I THINK THIS IS A IS A WORK BUILDING HAS BEEN THAT THAT HELPS THE LOS SURVIVE FOR LONG TERM NEXT PLEASE. AND HAVING JUST TALKED ABOUT FLEXIBILITY IN THE LEGISLATURE CHANGING LET'S TALK ABOUT. HOW THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE. WOULD CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO THIS INITIATIVE GOING FOR. NOW MANY INITIATIVE SHOW UP AND IF THEY PASSED THEY HAVE PROVISIONS SAYING YOU NEED TWO THIRDS OF BOTH HOUSES OR THREE QUARTERS OF A VOTE BOTH HOUSES THEY REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE CHANGED BECAUSE SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'M ON RECORD SAYING LOOK I ACTUALLY THINK THAT LEGISLATURE'S IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IS THE PLACE TO MAKE THE LAWS. SO THIS INITIATIVE SIMPLY SAYS. GUESS WHAT MAJORITY VOTE TO CHANGE THE LAW IN THE FUTURE. AND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THERE'S ONE STIPULATION AND ALL ACTUALLY DO NEXT LIES WELL TO- ALL. THE ONLY THING. THAT WE SAY IS THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE AN AMENDMENT THAT HURTS CONSUMER PRIVACY ANY OTHER MEMBER YOU WANT GREAT. BUT NOT ONE THAT HURTS CONSUMER PRIVACY NOW SOME PEOPLE CRITICIZED ME FOR THIS.

I MEAN THE BUSINESS ADVOCATE WHO'LL SAY THAT NO ONE'S GONNA SAY AT THIS IS MOTHERHOOD AND APPLE PIE WE'RE MERELY SAYING WE'RE INTRODUCING. POLICY FLOOR IN CALIFORNIA WHICH PROTECT. CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER. PRIVACY GOING FORWARD. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FISCAL ANALYSIS BECAUSE- I NEED TO TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT PLEASE. DO I SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON THE- REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GONNA COME UP LATER ON TODAY. THIS IS THE FAMOUS ASSESSMENT THAT SAID THAT THE COST OF CCPA WHICH IS NOT. THIS INITIATIVE I WANNA TALK WITH THE CITY ANYWAY IT'S GOING TO BE FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE STATE SO NEXT- THING I JUST WANT TO SAY I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF STUDIES I'M A BUSINESS PERSON. I THERE ARE IN MY MIND SOME SERIOUS METAL OF METHODOLOGICAL FLAWS IN THIS STUDY. WHEN THEY EXCEPT TO BE SHARED SUPPOSED TO SHARE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. NEXT PLEASE LATE THAT THE FIGURE FIFTY FIVE BILLION SECTION JUST OUT OF THIS NO TABLE IS NO. SET OF CALCULATIONS AND HOW THEY GOT THERE. NEXT PLEASE. THEY THEY THEY RELIED ON TO STUDIES THAT WERE DIED. PP ONCE JUST ONE THE PEOPLE COULD CHOOSE TO TAKE THERE WAS NEXT LIKELY THERE WAS NO CALIFORNIA ONLY SURVEY DATA. SO ONE OF THE STUDIES WAS HAD SIXTY COMPANIES OF FIVE HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT'S- THE COMPANY. THE OTHER ONE AT FIFTY ONE COMPANIES OF ONE TO TWO FIFTY. THIS IS NATIONALLY. AND FROM THAT NEXT. SLIDE PLEASE THEY CONCLUDED THAT EVERY CAL. BUSINESS OR FIVE. AS SUMMER BETWEEN TWENTY TWO AND 62% OF THE ONES. ONE FOUR PLEASE WOULD BE COVERED BY THE CPA. WELL WE ALL KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY BUSINESSES ARE TINY LITTLE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. TO THIS THE HANDYMAN THAT THAT THEY WERE ASSUMING THAT ALL THE HANDYMAN AND ALL THAT. ALL THE THREE LITTLE ONES EVERYTHING GONNA BE COVERED. HI THIS LAW AND IT'S CLEARLY NOT THE INTENT AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE BRING IT UP. LATER YOU'RE HERE IN YOUR TRAVELS. I WANT TO PROTECT. STRONGLY AGAINST OCEAN THAT THE FIFTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FIGURES I THINK ROBUST. NEXT PLEASE. SO WHAT NEXT STEPS WE SUBMITTED- NINE AND THREE ONE THOUSAND SIGNATURES EARLY IN MAY- FUN FACT LAST TIME AROUND IT WAS MORE PEOPLE THAN LIVED IN TWO STATES NOW IT'S- MORE PEOPLE MORECALIFORNIA REGISTERED VOTERS AND LIVE IN. FIVE STATES WERE DC- NEXT TO YOU CAN DO- BACK UP ON THANKS TO WE NEED SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND TO QUALIFY- AS OF MONDAY WE WERE AT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND IT'S A LITTLE- I WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE UPDATED FIGURE BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN UPDATED SINCE MONDAY EVEN THOUGH THE- OTHER- INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN UP THERE TWICE SINCE MONDAY SO WE'RE- WE'RE A LITTLE BIT. WONDERING WHAT THEY'RE- COMFORT THAT WE WILL QUALIFY- BY THE TWENTY FIFTH NEXT PLEASE. THIRTY ONE A CLOSE IN TALKING ABOUT US CONSUMER- REGULATION HISTORY. I THINK IT'S LIKELY TO PRESS THE FOR ME BECAUSE I THINK. WE SEE THIS MOVIE OR IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND WE DON'T LEARN FROM. AND I THINK PRIVACY IS A MOVEMENT WHOSE TIME HAS COME. AND SO IF YOU TO THE NEXT SLIDE HERE LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME PROMINENT EXAMPLES SO YEARS AUTO SAFETY. AND YOU KNOW WHEN THE WHOLE CITY MOVEMENT FOR STARTED THE COMPANY A QUIRK OF HIS FOUGHT IT TOOTHAND NAIL. AND THEY WERE NOT EXCITED ABOUT THE NOTION OF HAVING PUTTING AIRBAGS WERE HAVING TO PUT A LOT OF SAFETY FEATURES. AND NOW FAST FORWARD FIFTY SIX YEARS THINK ABOUT TRYING TO THE CAR WITHOUT EBS BREAKS ARE ABOUT WITHOUT. YOU KNOW AIR BAG WITHOUT SAFETY COUPLES ON YOU CONSUMER WOULD LOOK YOU SIDE WITH JUST LIKE NO WAY MY MIND THAT CAR. THE NEXT PLEASE- SMOKING YOU KNOW DOES ANYBODY THINK THAT THEY REALLY MISS WALKING TO A SMOKE FILLED BAR- THIS THE TOBACCO COMPANIES FUNDED TONS A BOGUS STUDIES BUT THE REALITY IS THE REGULATIONS IMPROVED LIFE WE DON'T HAVE BEEN CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINES IN HIGH SCHOOLS ANYMOREFOR A REASON. NEXT PLEASE- THIS ONE YOU KNOW AUTO EMISSIONS THIS IS WHERE CALIFORNIA REALLY TOOK THE LEAD IN- IT TREMENDOUS WAVE NATIONALLY- AND AS GOOD AS KEPT LEAD NATIONALLY WE WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW SEE ACROSS LOS ANGELES ON A CLEAR DAY OR THERE WAS NO CLEAR DAYS BEFORE AND NOW YOU CAN. THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR THE REGULATIONS AND AGAIN THIS WAS RESISTED PRETTY- FIRMLY AT THE TIME. NEXT PLEASE. I THINK IN CLOSING THE FOR ME ONE OF THE REASONS THIS IS SUCH pTHIS INFORMATION. IS USED DIFFERENTLY BY DIFFERENT SOCIETIES AND IF WITH THE AYE AYE I SORT OF STABLE FORGET THE IRON CURTAIN IS NOW THE DATA CURTAIN AND IF YOU LOOK AT SAY FOR EXAMPLE CHINA. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IT'S UBIQUITOUS AND IT'S USE FOR SOCIAL CONTROL IT IS USED TO STIFLE DISSENT IT IS USED TO. FOR FLOOD CONTROL. AND NEXT SLIDE PLEASE BUT THE INTERESTING THING THOUGH IS WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION HERE IT'S ALL AVAILABLE HERE. AND THIS IS FROM AN ARTICLE THE NEW YORK TIMES DID- DID DID RECENTLY WHICH- SHOWED HOW EASY IT IS. FOR INDIVIDUALS. WHO IN IN WHAT ELECT TECHIES WORKED AT A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN THE WRITING CASE WORKERS WORSHIP THAT A PARTICULAR CHURCH. TO BE TRACKED BACK TO THEIR HOMES TO IT TO BE IDENTIFIED. THAT ARTICLE TALKED ABOUT THE OPERA SINGER. WHO SANG AT GEORGE HW BUSH'S SERVICE NATIONAL CATHEDRAL BEING TRACKED BACK TO HOME AND THEN BE IDENTIFIED FROM HER PHONE. AND HOW ALARMED AND SHE WAS WHEN SHE WAS CONTACTED. SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT THIS ENDEAVOR THAT YOU ARE ENGAGED IN THIS COMMITTEE. THAT SENATOR DODD YOU ENGAGE IN TWO YEARS AGO IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT IT IS- IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE KIND OF SOCIETY WE ARE GOING TO. CREATE AND LEAVE FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND I'M PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT PART OF THIS JOURNEY I'LL GET I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER MACAQUE GUARD BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS I WANT TO WELCOME. MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF A FEW WEEKS TO THE HEARING. THE DESIGN WHICH LIKE TO MAKE IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I THINK THIS THING FOR ME APPRECIATED I JUST I'LL HAVE QUESTIONS FOLLOW AND SORRY I MISSED PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION BUT- WE'LL DIVE IN AND STUFF. VERY GOOD. MAYBE I SHOULD START WITH THE FIRST QUESTION FIRST QUESTION GOES TO MISLEAD OF FROM THE L. L. L.'S OFFICE. MISLI UP THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE IS- SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRESCRIPTIVE- WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF MONIES. ALLOCATED TO THE CONSUMER PRIVACY FUN. BUT THEN THE CCPA. A PROVIDING A MUCH LESS FLEXIBILITY FOR LET'S SAY DISCRETIONARY. USE OF THE FUNDS IN AN ACCESS OF WHAT IS NECESSARY. TO ENFORCE THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. NOW IN LIGHT OF THE NEW DEMANDS SO THE STATE NOW FACES- DUE TO COVER NINETEEN AND THE EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. UP DO YOU TEXAS HERE IS THE QUESTION DO YOU FORESEE ANY ISSUES. EITHER FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS OR FOR ANY OTHER STATE FUNCTIONS WHICH UP WITH THESE FUNDS EARMARKED FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE IN AND IF THAT'S CONFUSING OKAY CAN REPEAT THAT QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU DO YOU FORESEE ANY ISSUES OF EITHER FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OF CONSUMER PRIVACY LAWS OR FOR OTHER STATE FUNCTIONS WITH THESE FUNDS EARMARKED FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT- I I'M GONNA DO MY BEST TO ANSWER THAT FOR YOU CAN TELL ME WHETHER OR NOT- I DO SO- FIRST IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE MONIES THAT ARE GOING INTO THE CONSUMER PRIVACY FINE- BUT YOU HAVE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO GO INTO A FAX RELATED TO THAT THE CPPA. ALWAYS STARTING SHORTLY- ENFORCEMENT RELATED TO THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS KICK AND A LITTLE BIT LATER- AND SO IF THE TIMING IS A LITTLE BIT OF SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT BECAUSE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE IS WEIGHING CONCERNS RELATED TO THE ECONOMY AS WELL AS ADDRESSING COPE IN NINETEEN- AND SO I'M THINKING ABOUT KIND OF THAT PENALTY REVENUE THERE'S ALREADY A LITTLE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A LACK- I THINK THE SECOND ISSUE IS THE FIRST USE OF THE MONEY AS FOR STATE COURT AND DOJ COSTS. AND SO I THINK THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW AS WELL AS THIS YOU PROPOSAL THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS KIND OF ON ENFORCEMENT THERE MAYBE INTERPRETATIONS FOR HOW MUCH ENFORCEMENT S NEEDED AND SO IN THE IN THE- LAND IS UNDER THE LEGISLATURE'S PURVIEW. I IF THEY THINK MORE MONEY IS NECESSARY OR NEED IT. LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY BUT IT DOES BECOME A TRADE OFF DISCUSSION FOR THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN OTHER GENERAL FUND PRIORITY AND SO THAT CAN INCLUDE THINGS COMPLETELY OUTSIDE EDUCATION- EXCEPT OUR HEALTH CARE IT ON THOSE AREAS. SIMILARLY YOU KNOW IF. THE LEGISLATURE THINGS THAT MORE MONEY SHOULD BE DEDICATED TO THE END OF THIS AREA SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS A CONCERNED WITH- EDUCATING INDIVIDUALS LIKE CENTER AT HELPING OUT BUSINESSES THAT'S ANOTHER PRIORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN PUT INTO PLACE BUT I THINK THE KEY THING THAT I WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT IS. RELATED TO THE NINETY ONE PERCENT- INVESTMENT OF DOLLARS AS WELL AS THAN THAT BUT 9% GOING TO FIND- EDUCATION ETCETERA THAT IS GOING TO KIND OF TAKE A FACT. A LITTLE BIT LATER IN TERMS OF LIKE WE NEED TO SEE THE REVENUE AND THEN IT WOULD ONLY NEED TO GET OUT SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD BE DEALING WITH IMMEDIATELY I DON'T KNOW IF HOPE. THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS FOR MR MCTAGGART BUT DAHLE IMAGES ALTERNATE MAYBE I'LL START OFF WITH THE FIRST QUESTION AND AN OPEN- FOR MY COLLEAGUES OF FOR THE QUESTIONS- I THINK THE FIRST QUESTION DEALS WITH THE- AND EVERY THAT YOU STARTED TO TOUCH ON AND I WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT QUESTION A LITTLE BIT AND IF YOU COULD. OF YOU KNOW DO A LITTLE DEEPER DIVE OFF OF FOR THE FOR THE ANSWER SO THE QUESTION IS WHY IS NOW THE TIME TO DISPEL INITIATIVE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT YOU TRY TO ARGUE ANSWER. ON WHICH OVERWRITES THE CCPA WHEN WE HAVE JUST BEGUN IMPLEMENTING CC YEAH I WOULD BE BETTER TO BUILD UPON THE CCPA. IN BUSINESS. WHAT TO. AXIS THEIR RIGHTS UNDER SIEGE SO IT I KNOW IT'S A LOT QUESTION. SO WHY IS NOW THE TIME TO RUN ABOUT IT. WE IS ESSENTIALLY OVER RIGHTS TO SOME X. THE CCPA WHEN WE HOW JUST BEGUN IMPLEMENTING THE CCPA. SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO BUILD UPON THE CCPA. AFTER CONSUMER AFTER CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES HAVE MORE TIME TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THIS HE'S. WELL AGAIN AS I AS I AS I AS I TRIED TO- ELABORATE EARLIER- MY PROFOUND CONVICTION IS THIS IS NOT OVER WRITING CCP THIS IS BUILDING ON THE CPA SO THIS IS THIS IS ENHANCING CCPA. A BEAR IN MIND THERE'S A LONG RUNWAY HERE THAT THIS- ENFORCEMENT FOR THIS ACT IF IT PASSES WOULD START IN THE MIDDLE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE JULY TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO LET ME LOTS OF TIME FOR THE CPA TO BE IN EFFECT. AND I'D- AGAIN ALSO BUILDING ON THE FACT REMINDING- THE FACT THAT THE LEGISLATURE STILL WILL HAVE TOTAL FLEXIBILITY. TO DEAL WITH. ANY CHANGES THAT WANTS TO MAKE. IN IN THE COMING YEARS- IT'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS STOPS LEGISLATURE FROM MAKING ANY CHANGES. IT JUST MERELY AGAIN CONCEPT FLOOR THRESHOLD IN SO I THINK THAT IT THIS IS A IS. A CREATIVE. THIS THIS THIS BUILT ON AND I THINK- AT FOR THE TO THE REASONS I SAID EARLIER. COULD IN THE NATIONAL ONE- INCLUDING THE FACT THAT- IT PUT FLOOR FOR CALIFORNIA THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. RIGHT NOW. THANK MUCH BEFORE WE GO. QUESTION I WANT TO WELCOME A- US SENATOR HERTZBERG FOR JOINING US SENATORS FOR OBVIOUSLY IS THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER- AND- SO I WANT TO WELCOME YOU AND AT THIS TIME LIKE TO SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS ARE. LIKELY REMARKS. TO THE AUDIENCE YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN APOLOGIZE. WORK IN ANOTHER. CRITICAL ISSUE FOR CALIFORNIA BUT YEAH I DO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I. WASN'T ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE REMARK SO FAR IN THIS HEARING AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MY DELAY AND I. OR START UP BY THANKING YOU IN THE EFFORTS THAT WE ENGAGE IN. GO BOTH A LOT OF SLEEPLESS NIGHTS AROUND THE CLOCK WORK. TO DO THE EXTRAORDINARY- EFFORT THAT WE WROTE TO AND WAS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS IT THAT WE CAN'T REMEMBER THE CALL COME TOGETHER WITH WITH THE INITIAL PRIVACY ACT THAT QUITE FRANKLY. BEING CANDID YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL WE WERE TRYING TO GET- MYSTERY TAG WHICH MEASURE OFF THE BALLOT I HAD WORKED FOR MANY YEARS PREVIOUSLY ON ON REFORMING THE INITIATIVE PROCESS STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SPEAKERS. COMMISSION INITIATIVE REFORM TO TRY TO CREATE SOME MORE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND PROPONENTS AND THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT AND WE SPENT HUNDREDS OF HUNDREDS OF HOURS. WITH MR MCTAGGART AND OTHERS- IN EFFORT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT. WOULD WORK REASONABLY WELL. BUT THIS AREA PRIVACY IS INFORMED IN A DIFFERENT WAY BY ISSUES THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY SEE IN THE LEGISLATURE FIRST HIT IS SUCH A FAST MOVING- TECHNOLOGY INFORMED. AREA OF THE LAW THAT SOME OF THESE THINGS WOULD EVEN KNOW THAT HAPPENED WHO KNEW ABOUT COUNT STEPS ARE HEART BEATS OUR GEO LOCATION OR ALL THOSE THINGS. SO THAT BECOMES QUITE CHALLENGING SECONDLY. WHERE THERE MIGHT OFTEN BE A FIGHT BETWEEN LABOR AND BUSINESS OR CERTAIN MEDICAL INTERESTS OR DOCTORS OR LAWYERS THIS WAS QUITE CHALLENGING BECAUSE THROUGHOUT THE YEARS DIFFERENT COMPANIES HAVE USED DIFFERENT ECONOMIC MODELS. TRYING DEVELOP THEIR BUSINESS. WE FOUND IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WHERE WE'RE COMPANY A SOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA COMPANY BE LONG COMES ALONG AND THEY WANT TO KILL IT BECAUSE IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR BUSINESS MODEL. IT WAS QUITE A CHALLENGE AND SO THE EFFECT OF WAS AND IS YOU KNOW THIS MISTER-CHAIRMAN I YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT IN OUR EFFORT UNDER YOUR MEASURE. THE IDEA WAS THAT WE WOULD ARE. BY THE BILL. GET MISTER MIKE TAGGERT MAY A THE BALLOT AND WE DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION FOR A YEAR. AND THE REASON WE DID IMPLICATION FOR YEARS THAT WE DIDN'T FEEL. IN THE HONOR OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE TIME WE HAD OUR BRIEF HEARINGS THAT YOU WERE PRESENT THAT. TO REALLY ENGAGE IN KIND OF SCREW. BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WELL NO NO ONE BELIEVE WE CAN GET OFF THE BALLOT DIDN'T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE. PEOPLE KIND OF FUN THEIR NOSE AT US IN IN KIND OF QUITE FRANKLY. AND NO ONE THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLE. SO IF YOU REMEMBER WE GAVE THEM A DOOR A AMADOR VIA. OPTIONS AND THEY SELECTED THE ONE THE MEASURE THAT WAS THE CPA. BUT THE BY MY HOPE WAS THAT WE WOULD ENGAGE IN A VERY ROBUST DEBATE. IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO BE ABLE TO SCRUB THE LEGISLATION WE KNEW GOING IN THAT THERE WERE MISTAKES TAT WE MADE. AND EFFECTS AT. FACT OF THE MATTER WAS NOT MUCH HAPPENED WHY IS A RELEVANT BUT IT IT'S JUST NOT MUCH HAPPENED. AND THE QUESTION THEN BECAME YOU KNOW I FELT QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WITH APPRECIATE THIS THE OF TORTILLA THAT WAS GIVEN TO THEM SHE CPA. AND CREATED SOME CHALLENGES JUST JUST PUT IT THERE AND SO WE WERE LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND WE WERE TRYING TO EXPLORE AN OPTION TO TRADE AGENCY. THAT COULD BASICALLY DO THIS LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LIKE THE YOU KNOW THE F. T. I MEAN THE ELECTIONS YEAH TRADE COMMISSION ALWAYS OF THE COMMISSION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE CAN WITH THE ELEGANT WAY. THAT WILL WAITED FAVOR OF BUSINESSES THAT WITH INDUSTRY HEAVY BUT JUST TO AWAY. IT WAS A CONCERT OF ALL OF THAT. ON WHAT WAS CLEAR WAS WE JUST COULDN'T GET ANYWHERE. WAS FURTHER CLEAR WAS THAT- IN A LARGER DYNAMIC THAT THIS ISSUE OF PRIVACY WAS BECOMING BIGGER AND BIGGER. BIGGER PRIVACY RIGHTS GROUP. YOU KNOW PERSONAL DATA AS IT IS A SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WASN'T REALLY COVERED. IT WAS BECOMING A BIGGER AND BIGGER ISSUE IS COMPANIES WERE ENGAGED IN BEHAVIOR THAT QUITE FRANKLY. AS I'VE SAID SO MANY TIMES WAS CREEPY. AND ON THE OTHER SAYS WE NEED DEEPER PRINT SUMMER PROTECTIONS ON THE OTHER HAND WE HAD THESE HORRIBLE. CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THE ALL OF THESE VARIOUS BUSINESS MODELS THAT WERE HAPPENING AND EVERYBODY WAS GOING CRAZY. SENATOR DODD WAS INVOLVED IN THIS HE WAS OF A PRINCIPLE- JOIN AUTHOR AND ALL THIS STUFF. THE OTHER THE OTHER WORK ON SERVICES WERE FINISHED HERE BUT THE POINT IS. THAT WE MET WE WERE WE WERE FACED WITH A VERY DIFFICULT ETHICAL DECISION. DO WE LET THIS THING CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD IN IN IN THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT SAID WHERE THEY WERE CLEARLY MORE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE NEEDED CLEARLY CHANGE THAT NEED TO BE MADE. ORDER WE GO BACK TO THE BALLOT. I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAID THIS YEAR INTRODUCTION BUT DO WE GO BACK TO THE BALLOT. AND THE DECISION WAS MADE I THINK THE RIGHT DECISION. AND I AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS WERE SPENT BY NUMBER OF US FOR MONTHS. GOING THROUGH THIS AND THE ADVANTAGE WE HAD WAS WE PRETTY MUCH KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEMS WERE UNDER C. C. P. A NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO ALL OF US THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BOTH ON THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY. AND THOSE OF US INVOLVED IN THE SENATE SENATOR DODD CENTER JACKSON. HAD HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF COMMENTS FROM GROUPS ALL ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM. OF IDEAS THAT THEY HAD SO UNLIKE- WHAT WE SAW BEFORE WHERE SOMEBODY COMES IN WHO'S- GOT THE RESOURCES TO WRITE BUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. THIS WAS TWO YEARS OF A YEAR AND A HALF OF JUST EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF COMMENTS FROM PEOPLE. WHERE WE COULD UNDERSTAND WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING FROM AND SO THE PROCESS WAS- WE CAME UP WITH THIS. AND I GOTTA TELL YOU I MEAN I IT'S THE HARDEST THING IN THE YEAR THAT I'VE BEEN A- WORKED ON. AND I THINK THIS. ARE THE MOST ELEGANT. I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT COMPROMISES BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY THE- THE- THE IMPACTS ON THE- A PROTECTING CONSUMERS ARE MORE EXPANSIVE. THE SOPHISTICATION OF MORE DETAILS. ARM AND MANY OF THE MISTAKES THAT WE HAD MADE AND WE MADE THAT MUCH YOU JUST CAN'T WRITE A BILLS COMPLICATED WITHOUT MAKING MISTAKES- WERE SCRUBBED. SO I GOT TO TELL YOU I JUST WANT TO GIVE. MR TAGGER TO GREAT- ATTA BOY AND- THANK HIM FOR CONTINUING YOU KNOW. LAST THING ALL SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN. MISTER GOING OFF THIS. AND IN BUFFY YOU WERE INVOLVED IN ALL THE SERVER WORK. ON ALL THESE ISSUES AS WELL IN A PRETTY DEEP WAY. WAS WHAT WAS UNIQUE HERE. WAS OFTEN SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE RESOURCES COMES AND PUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT. AND PUT IT BEFORE THE VOTERS WHICH YOU HAD HERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY AFTER- THE INITIATIVE BUT WORKING HIRING MORE EXPERTS THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY TRAVELING WORKING WITH THE EUROPEANS WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON DC AND NEW YORK AND ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. CONTINUE TO EDUCATE HIMSELF CONTINUING TO DO THE HOMEWORK AND SO THIS WASN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS DROPPED ON FOLKS BUT THAT WAS LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF HOURS NOT. FROM THE DAYS THAT THIS IN MEASURE WAS ADOPTED ON THE- JUNE WHATEVER IT WAS NOT TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TILL TODAY MR ME TAG HAS NOT STOPPED. BEING DEEPLY ENGAGED IN EVERY ELEMENT. OF THIS PROCESS IN A VERY THOUGHTFUL WAY AT A VERY REASONABLE WAY- AND I THINK THAT THE- BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMER FACING IT EVERY QUESTION EVERY MEASURE. HI THIS IS PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND SO I JUST THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB AND I. SORRY FOR THE LONG INTRODUCTION BUT IT'S A SHORT INTRODUCTION COMPARED TO THE- HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF HOURS THAT WE DON'T DO DEVOTED TO THIS. TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS EXCEPTIONALLY COMPLICATED ISSUE AND MOVING TARGET. AND I'M HOPEFUL I AS A MEMBER OF THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER I'M PART OF THE MAJORITY LEADER'S A- CONFERENCE AS WELL AS- THE- STATE REGION LEADERS FOUNDATION AND- NATIONALLY THESE GROUPS HAVE. CHOSEN TO MAKE PRIVACY ONE OF THEIR TOP PRIORITIES IN THEIR LEGISLATOR AWESOME. EMMA LOOK IS ALL THE COUNTRY. SO I'M HOLD THAT IN MANY CASE THAT HAVE. WITH IDEAS IN CALIFORNIA JUST GOT OFF OF CALL ON BAIL AND I'M HOPING THAT THAT SETS THE TONE OF THE FUTURE. AND THAT WE COULD DO THE SAME THING. IN THIS VERY DELICATE ISSUE PRIVACY THE STATE THAT IS AN INNOVATIVE PLACE THAT IT AT ITS FOUNDATION. DEALS WITH INDUSTRY AT THE CORE OF THE PRIVACY DEBATE IN WITH THAT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME. I'LL JUST IT'S A LONG STATEMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR HERTZBERG- AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INVITE MY COLLEAGUES TO- WAS QUESTIONS TO THE- FIRST TWO PRETTY RECEIVED THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. ON THIS WEEK'S GO AHEAD PLEASE THANK YOU I'M THANK YOU MISTER ENTIRE FOR COMING AND SPEAKING AND YOU KNOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS- ON AND OFF OVER THE LAST. SINCE I'VE BEEN IN OFFICE HERE AND I. AM A BIG PROPONENT OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND PRIVACY AND- ALSO SURE MISTER HERTZBERG- EIGHT DOLLARS MEANT THAT THIS IS IT EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE. AND IT'S VERY COMPLICATED AND SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO. EXPLAIN TO SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS HARD PRESSED TO UNDERSTAND TO MOVE SO QUICKLY THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND SO WE HAVE TO BE. ADAPTED TO IT- YOU KNOW AND I ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS- I'VE MET WITH MANY MANY MANY OF THEM OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF. AND YOU'RE YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE BEST. POSSIBLE POLICY SOLUTION TO IT HERE TO THE GOAL OF. AND CONSUMER PROTECTION OF A LOT OF. LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS. BUT ONE THING I WANTED TO FLAG I KNOW THAT- LAST YEAR IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR- A COALITION OF CONSUMER GROUPS INCLUDED ACLU ANY FF AND- COMMON SENSE MEDIA AND A BUNCH OF OTHER FOLKS THAT SENT IN. A LETTER WITH IT FORTY FIVE SUGGESTED- CHANGES TO THE DRAFT- THAT WERE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT THE INITIATIVE TO NOT ROLL BACK PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS ONLY ABOUT SEVEN OF THOSE WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT SORT OF TO SOME DEGREE- I JUST WONDER IF YOU COULD HELP EXPLAIN. AND IF IT. IF I'M WRONG ON THAT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT. BUT IF YOU CAN HELP EXPLAIN MY MORE OF THOSE THE COALITION SUGGESTIONS RUN CORPORATE IN THE FINAL VERSION OF THE INITIATIVE. AND ARE IN ARE YOU ALSO STILL WORKING WITH THOSE FOLKS AND- YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY. PRIVACY ADVOCATES THAT I TURN TO FOR MY OWN UNDERSTANDING I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT- INPUT IS RECEIVED AND- STILL. WITH AMBER WHAT'S UP WHAT'S- AND WHAT THEIR STATUS. TAKE ON A- THIS THANK YOU. AGAIN ALSO IS A MEMBER OF. YOUR INTEREST GOOD IT'S BEEN ABOUT A BIG ONE FOR YOU- YOU'VE BEEN PASSION ABOUT THIS ISSUE. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR INTEREST ISSUE. I DID A ONE. THIRD COME SO I JUST I TOOK THE- OF AND I DIDN'T HAVE A- OF TIME DO ALL BUT- JUST HERE'S A LIST OF. THAT WE DO TAKE FROM LETTER WE TO OUT. OTHER SUCH. DISCLOSE PURPOSES FROM SECTION ONE HUNDRED. SECTION ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO- WE DID THE SAME THING FOR PURPOSE LIMITATION FOR DATA MINIMIZATION WE CHANGED THE USE RETENTION AND SHARING. FROM COLLECTIONS. WE TOOK UP OF SECTION ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE T. ONE. WE DELETED A HUNDRED AND FIVE DENIED THESE ARE ALL THEIR REQUEST YEAH. WE DIDN'T DELETE- ONE TWENTY FIVE WE DID INTEREST THAT SECOND OPTION WHICH- IS. THE KEY. YEAH IN. THEIR IN PROFILING VICTIM LIKE THAT WE WERE. TO THE G. DEFINITION OF PRO. IN THEIR- BACK. WE TOOK OUT THE- OF. POP AS DESIGNED. THAT FROM SECURITY TO. WE TOLD THE CHAIN THE NOT. EVER TO BE PURELY TO. WITH DEAL OKAY. REVERTED TO ORIGINAL DE. OF WONDERS OF. WITH THERE ARE. OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WE DID TO DELETE THE RESTRICTION ON USE ONCE RELEASED BY GOVERNMENT I WAS ONE THERE'S- BUT WE DIDN'T. REALIZE IS. AT. IN RESPECT THIS PROVIDE THERE CAN ABOUT COMBINE PERSONAL. WE STUCK IN A HOLE CLAUSEN ONE EIGHTY FIVE A ELEVEN. DESTRUCTIVE AGENCY WITH RESPECT TO COMBINING. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS DONE IN A WAY TO MAXIMIZE CONSUMER PRIVACY- WE REMOVE WE TIGHTENED UP THE AT THERE'S JUST AND ONE FORTY FIVE A ONE WITH. A VALID LEGAL. PROCESS WHICH GOT THAT PHRASE FELL TO GO PROCESS AND WE MADE IT MUCHMORE RESTRICTIVE- ONE FORTY FIVE EIGHT TWO. REGARDING INVESTIGATION MEANS THAT WE KNOW OUR- CASE ACTIVE CASE NUMBER- TO HAVE A- A HIGH RANKING POLICE OFFICER WITHIN THREE DAYS YOU NEED TO GO GET A COURT ORDER BUT- IN. FUNDS CHOP WELFARE THE BETTER. JEFF EVEN WANT TO HAVE A OF EMERGED EXCEPT WE CHANGE AND THE- THEY DID WANT US TO MAKE THAT PERMITS SO WE MADE WINDOWS YEARS SO. BUT THAT'S A PART LIST OF WE TEAMS THEIR WORK. AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE POINT IS IT'S- YOU NEVER TO PLEASE EVERYBODY- WE YOU KNOW AND ONE OF THESE I WILL SAY AND I SAID IT BEFORE BUT HE'S HERE NOW. LAST FALL. CENTER HERTZBERG WITH THEIR MOST OF THE PHONE CALLS THOUSANDS I MEAN IN A WITHIN SEVEN WEEKS IT WAS. A CRAZY AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE SPENT. A LOT OF THE TIME IT'S RELYING ON SOMEONE'S GOT A TREMENDOUS TRACK RECORD OF GETTING THINGS DONE AND FOR SAYING HEY WHERE DO YOU THINK WE CAN OF WHAT WE'RE IS THAT WHERE IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO DRAW THE LINE. YOU KNOW FOR ME I'M A BIG PER. IS THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD. PERSON AND I'M TRYING TO GET SOME THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME THAT WILL- THAT WOULD BE WE CAN ACHIEVE. AND SO THERE WERE. AND UNFORTUNATELY- THAT'S LIFE. BUT I WILL SAY. THAT MY HAT IS OFF THESE ARE THESE ARE. RELATIVELY SMALL GROUPS COMPARE THESE GIANT INDUSTRIES. YOU KNOW IF IT'S CONSUMER REPORT THREE FF FOR- IS STILL YOU OR COMMONSENSE. AND THEY ARE- THEY'RE FIGHTING FOR JUSTICE THERE FIGHTING FOR- PRIVACY AND IN MANY RESPECTS. I COULD HAVE DONE. ANY OF WHAT I'VE DONE. HAD THEY NOT BEEN OUT THERE AT THE FOREFRONT FOR ALL THOSE YEARS TRYING TO. RAISE THE THESE. IS AND KEEP THEM- IN IN IN IN. FOUR FIVE THE- OF PEOPLE'S MINDS SO. MY HAT IS OFF TO THEM- ALSO PRICE RATES GREENHOUSE. SHOULD MENTION THEM- HAS AFTER ALL. AND THAT'S- THE- THANK YOU FOR THAT. DO YOU AND HAS THE GETTING THEIR OFFICIAL. DO YOU HAVE ANY FIRST INTERVIEW ANTICIPATEDI'M A I I'VE I'VE- CHOSEN NOT TO. ANYBODY FOR THEIR FISH SUPPORT AND I HAVE THAT BALANCE CENTER I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M A BIG SORT OF LOOK FOLLOWING A- AND GET ONE THING DONE. ONCE WE HAVE WHAT'S WERE ON THE BALLOT THAT I PLAN TO GO OUT FOR THEIR PERSONAL SUPPORT ALL OF THEM YEAH- AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD. SUPPORT BECAUSE THIS. AT THIS THIS THIS WOULD BE. I EVEN STRONGER THE CPA. I THINK. AGAIN ALL THE REASONS I WENT THROUGH I WOULD. I WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO GET ALL SUPPORT. AND IS IT THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL CONTACTS I APPRECIATE THAT. AND IS IT YOUR SENSE. THANK I'VE HEARD ARE THE- POTENTIALLY THIS CONTROL LIKE SOME OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION THIS. IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING YOU THINKTHIS ACTUALLY STRENGTHENED HIS ANY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE WEAKENED WITH THIS INITIATIVE. WHAT I DISCUSSED I THINK IT I THINK IS VASTLY MOVED THE BALLFORWARD ON A WHOLE BUNCH AREAS I THINK THAT THERE IS. AND I AND I THINK THERE'S CONFUSION AROUND THAT ONE THE SECOND OPTION WE'VE CREATED WITH THE DO NOT CALL VERSUS WHERE NOW A COMPANY- STILL HAS RESPECT OR DO NOT SELL OPTION BUT- CHOICE IT DOESN'T. PUT UP A- RESTRICTION HOWEVER OFTEN CAN'T CHARGE YOU. CAN DISCRIMINATE AGAINST YOU I THINK THAT THAT WAS I THINK WE'RE THE WORLD'S GONNA GO. I THINK THE ONLY ONE PEOPLE. WANT TO AND SAY. WELL WHY DO YOU DO THIS IS THAT SELECT. OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. THAT CHANGE. AND AGAIN AS I SAID WE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSORS TELL ME SOMETHING. I GOT A LIST OF THAT THEY WERE UNANIMOUS AND THEY ALSO DO NEED TO CHANGE THIS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE. A AN EXEMPTION FOR WHEN HERTZBERG HANDS OUT- BUT THE STORY OF HIS TRIP TO CHINA ANY PASSES IT OUT. OF THAT'S NOT PERCENT RATIO ANYMORE AND WE DID WE DON'T HAVE A RIGHT NOW TO SKIP SO I'M- I'LL TAKE THE HEAT FOR THAT ONE BUT AND FOR ME I. MIGHT MY OLD. LAST FIND THE BEST MINDS I COULD. LIST TO THEM. TAKE EXPERT ADVICE. AND YOU'RE TRYING TO LISTEN TO BE MORE TRANSLATE SOMETHING. AND THESE PEOPLE OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR THAN I DON'T PAY THEM THEY WERE JUST- PEOPLE WHO VOLUNTEERED YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES TENS OR HUNDREDS OF HOURS TO. REVIEW THIS AND THEY WERE- CONSISTENT CONSIST ABOUT IT BUT NO LET ME BE CLEAR. THIS LAW WOULD DRAMATICALLY STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PRIVACY CALIFORNIA. IT WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF THE REACH OF BEING. HURT BY A FUTURE LEGISLATURE THAT WANTED TO. IT WOULD SET A STRONG MESSAGE NASH. I THINK THIS WOULD. KLAY BUT- I'M JUST BLOCK. ACTIVE IN THE- AND THE PEOPLE ASSUME TO BE OURS ONE COUNTRY YOU KNOW FOR ONE LAW IS NOT SIMPLY TO BUY EVERY SINGLE COUNTRY WHERE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY THE WORLD WILLHAVE ONE REGULATOR REGULATING THIS WE WILL SUDDENLY BECOME I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIVACY PLAYER. IN THE WORLD. ALSO THANK YOU. BOB THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MAYBE I GOT PASSED NIGHT NEXT QUESTION ALL I THINK YOU TOUCHED ON THIS BRIEFLY ALSO MISTER MCTAGGART ARM THE INITIATIVE PERMITS THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT TO BE AMENDED BY THE LEGISLATURE WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY UP HERE FOR THE AMENDMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND FOR HER TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY. OTHERWISE IT WOULD REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE OF THE PHRASE IN FURTHERANCE OF- TO BE INTERPRETED AND DEEP HOW DO YOU ENVISION THAT PROVISION TO AFFECT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THANK. EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THAT TERM OR WILL IMPEDE TO LEGISLATORS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS NEEDS A BY CHANGING THE LAW. IF YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT REPEAT QUESTOR AND SO LET ME START BY A HERE'S THE HERE'S ONE OF THE I THINK IT REALLY IMPORTANT PHRASES FROM THAT SECTION. THAT CONSUMER PRIVACY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF BENEFICIAL NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICE ARE NOT NECESSARILY INCOMPATIBLE GOALS. PROVIDED AMENDMENTS DON'T COMPROMISE OR WE CAN CONSIDER PRIVACY. SO SOME HAVE TO DRAW A LINE AND YOU HAVE TO SERICE YOU HAVE TO SAY THIS TO PLEASE YOU CAN'T SO THAT'S OUR OUR THRUSH YOU KNOW THAT. CALM WINDS ARE WE CAN CAN. YOU CAN HAVE THIS IS A OLD. DECK FOR ME. AND MY ANSWER THAT IS. LOOKING IT'S- A LOT BETTER THAN NOTHING WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW THE GREAT OTHER NO PROTECTIONS AND SO FUTURE LEGISLATURE TO COME IN WITHOUT YOU. MEMBERS HERE WHO. IN THIS AND THEY COULD CHANGE ALL OF THE STRIP IT OUT PUT IT OUT OF EXISTENCE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE- WHEN MEMBERS PROPOSED BILLS. THE CONSULTANTS IN THE IN THE- COMMITTEES. PERFORM A KIND OF A- HIGH LEVEL ANALYSIS AND THEY'LL- I THINK IT WILL BE QUITE. QUICKLY PRETTY SIMPLE AS TO WHETHER SOMETHING IS OR IS NOT YOU KNOW COULD HURT CONSUMER PRIVACY. YES AT THE END OF THE DAY IF. WERE IN SHE WOULD END UP THE COURT BUT- AGAIN THAT'S NOT THE WORLD IT'S A LOT BETTER CONSTRUCT. VAN PROTECTION. SOMETHING MISTER. IN THIS THIS IN THIS INITIATIVE AND BASICALLY ALMOST EVERY INITIATIVE. YOU KNOW IN THE STEM CELL THEY'VE GOT A SUPER MAJORITY TO MAKE CHANGES IF YOU LOOK TO THE HISTORY OF ALL THESE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE BALLOT. AND LITIGATION IF YOU KNOW THAT HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF IN FURTHERANCE OF IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING AND- IF YOU GO ON PERHAPS THE STATUTORY AS OPPOSED TO A CONSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVE I THINK YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT YOU'VE GOT ISSUE THERE SO IF YOU DON'T PUT IN FURTHERANCE LANGUAGE IT'S PROBLEMATIC OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY'S WANTED TO HAVE TWO THIRDS VOTE BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT. THE LEGISLATURE PASSING A- OF A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW WAS A BIG QUESTION IT WAS A BIG QUESTION THAT LETTER. AND HE DECIDED NOT TO DO WHAT I WAS FAVOR BUT EITHER THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON WE GOT A PRIVACY DEAL BECAUSE OF. THE REASON IT WAS WRONG. TO THIS INSTITUTION IT EVERY BONE IN MY BODY TO MAKE A DEAL AND THEN. BEFORE THE INK IS DRY TO THEN GO AND GO BACK ON THE DEAL. BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S GOING TO BE LITIGATED CERTAINLY I SUSPECT FUTURE LEGISLATURE WILL DO THAT AND THAT WILL BE LITIGATED AND THAT'S ALWAYS THE CASE. BUT IT BUT- PROBABLY IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATION THE MOST. ELEMENTS HERE BECAUSE- HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE VACATION. HOW TO DEAL WITH ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES. AND I PROBABLY OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WORKED ON THIS IN FURTHERANCE LANGUAGE IF YOU READ THE SECTIONS WAS SECTION SEE OR SOMETHING PAGE THREE. MEMBERS CORRECT. THAT LAST WHICH IS VERY VERY VERY SENSITIVE AND- REALLY TRYING TO. HELLO THE WAY THAT WE DO. ALL OF PRIVACY ON THE ONE HAND. YET DON'T MAKE THE ENTIRE ISSUE THE INITIATIVE MEANINGLESS SO THAT NEXT YEAR THE LEGISLATURE COMES O AND JUST TOTALLY FLIPS IT. BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH ARCHITECTURE IN THIS. AND TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK SO. I CAN SAY IS I JUST. BUT BUT IT'S BEEN A- IT'S BEEN SUCH A BIG ISSUE ON SO MANY INITIATIVES THAT I WORKED ON OF THE LAST DECADES. ARM THAT THAT'S ALWAYS THE CORE AND I THINK THAT THE BALANCE THAT WAS STRUCK AND THIS. WAS QUITE ELEGANT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP. SO I THINK I'M GONNA ASSAM AND MISSED MY COGNITIVE STATE UP FRONT FOR THE QUESTIONS. AND AT THIS TIME I I'M GONNA. ARE GOOD A SECOND PANEL- IF THAT'S OKAY LET'S SEE. THE BACK THANK YOU REALLY THANK. BECAUSE NO GROUP'S SELF FORMALLY OPPOSED OR SUPPORTED THIS INITIATIVE MEASURE OF THIS PANEL IS MADE UP BUT THIS NEXT PANEL IS MADE OF WHAT WE ARE CALLING INTERESTED PARTIES- FIRST WE'LL HEAR FROM CONSUMER ADVOCACY TO HELP OUR- IN MINUTES MONEY FOLLOW BY INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE ALSO BEEN. A FIFTY. AFTER THE PANELISTS HAVE I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR THE MEMBERS- TO QUESTION THEM I ASKED THAT ALL PANELISTS REMAIN AVAILABLE AFTER THING- CONCLUSION OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL TESTIMONY FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. SO LET'S GO WITH- NOW NEXT TO PANEL FROM CONSUMER REPORTS WE HOW OFTEN IS MAUREEN MAHONEY- MISTER MAHONEY I YOU WITH THANK YOU THANK THANKS FOR JOINING US SO FIRST OF ALL. AND ANYTIME YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY I'M A POLICY ANALYST AT CONSUMER REPORTS AND I CAN SEE MORE PORTS WE REALLY WAITED THAT JANUARY FIRST IMPLEMENTS. COUNTY OF THE CITY PA WHEN CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME WE GET IMPORTANT BASELINE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF FEDERAL IN ACTION. BUT AS THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT TO BE. CLEAR THAT YOU NEED TO BE STRENGTHENS GIVEN WIDESPREAD NONCOMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. THE BIGGEST DATA COLLETOR IS LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK DECLARE THAT THEIR DATA SHARING WAS OUTSIDE OF THE OPT OUT OF SALEM EMBOLDENED BY WE CAN FORSMAN PROVISIONS. COMPANIES EXPLOITED LOOPHOLES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER CROSS EYED CROSS DEVICE TARGET ADVERTISING. YOU KNOW GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL OVER THIS KIND OF DATA SHARING WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF THE CCPA. AND SO MANY COMPANIES HAVE SIZE UP THE CZ PEERING WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACTS WOULD CLOSE UP TARGET ADVERTISING LOOPHOLES. STRENGTHEN ENFORCEMENT AND HELP PREVENT THE LEGISLATURE FROM WEAKENING THE MEASURE. AT THE SAME TIME WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE INTRODUCES NEW AMBIGUITIES AND GLASSES CERTAINLY POLLS LIKE ALLOWING SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMBINE DATA RECEIVED FROM MULTIPLE COMPANIES. AND FINALLY PRIVACY IS A RIGHT NOT SOMETHING THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR SO WE THINK IT'S A MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THAT PRIVACY ISN'T JUST SOMETHING THAT THE RICH SHOULD ENJOY. SO GOING TO THESE POINTS IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL. THE FIRST THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD CAN GIVE CONSUMERS ETTER CONTROL OVER TARGETED ADVERTISING- IN THIS IS TO BE THE DEFINITION OF SALE AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER EXEMPTION HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED BY COMPANIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER THESE ADS OUTSIDE THE OPT OUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION OF SALE EVEN THOUGH IT IS A REALLY BROAD DEFINITION OF SALES SOME COMPANIES HAVE CLAIMED THAT BECAUSE MONEY IN AND DAY DARKNESS BEING EXCHANGED. IT'S NOT A SALE- WHAT HAPPENS IS MONEY IN DATA OFTEN FLOWS IN THE SAME DIRECTION TO I TECH PLATFORMS TO SHOW ADS ON MULTIPLE SITES THE SERVICE WRITER EXEMPTION. HAS ALSO BEEN EXPLOITED- PUBLISHERS ARE SAYING THAT THEY CAN SHARE DATA- WITH HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES TO DELIVER ADVERTISING AS PART OF A SERVICE PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS THEY'LL BE OUTSIDE THE OPT OUT. SO THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD- ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY CREATING THIS NEW CATEGORY OF SHARING THAT CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT OF EXPOSING CLARIFIES THAT CROSS CONTEXT TARGET ADVERTISING. IS PART OF THAT SO CONSUMERS COULD OPT OUT. AND THE SERVICE WRITER EXEMPTION IS SIGNED UP BY EXCLUSIVELY CLARIFYING THAT CROSS CONTEXT TARGET ADVERTISING ISN'T OP PERMISSIBLE BUSINESS PURPOSE- SO IT'S REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE WRITER. EXEMPTION IN OUR OPINION HOW THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WOULD MEANINGFULLY STRENGTH IN ENFORCEMENT PARTICULARLY BY REMOVING THIS RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION IN ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT THAT'S ESSENTIALLY. I GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD- FEELS I THINK THE CREATING A NEW AGENCY THAT'S EXCLUSIVELY DEVOTED TO IMPLEMENTING AND ENFORCING THIS LAW- COULD HELP PUT SOME TEETH BEHIND THE MEASURE AND WE ALSO APPRECIATE. THAT THIS DOES ALL LIMIT THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO WEEKEND. THE LAW. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE BALLOT SHOULD OF INTRODUCES SOME LESS THAN IDEAL ELEMENTS IN SOME CASES WEAKER THAN EXISTING LAW. FOR EXAMPLE A CREATE A NEW CONFUSING EXEMPTION FOR SHARING PERSONAL DATA WITH CONTRACTORS BEYOND WHAT'S ALREADY A LOT FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. IT ALSO CREATES OF COMPLETED MECHANISM FOR CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF SHARING OR SALE- SO THIS IS ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A UNIVERSAL OPT OUT SO CONSUMERS DON'T HAVE TO GO TO EVERY SINGLE COMPANY TO OPT OUT OF JAIL. FOR SHARING INFORMATION- WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED STATE WORKERS ON THE CALIFORNIA DATA BROKER REGISTRY ALONE NOT TO MENTION. THE HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ARE COLLECTING CONSUMERS STATE. IF THEY'RE GONNA OPT OUT ONE BY ONE THIS IS COMPLETELY UNWORKABLE- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT SOME COMPANIES HAVE MADE CONSUMERS JUMP THROUGH HOOPS IN ORDER TO OPT OUT- ONE DATA FOR THIS. CATION DATA DOWN. A SEPARATE HOW TO MY PHONE- JUST ARTICLE ONCE- SO- YOU KNOW ONE CONSUMER TOLD ME THEY COULD EVEN COMPLETE ONE OPT OUT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MUCH WORK. MAKING A SIMPLE SIMMERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE CALL ATTORNEY RULES ARE CLEAR THAT THEY WERE COME HAVE A GLOBAL DO NOT SELL SIGNAL IN CONTRAST ABOUT INITIATIVE MANDATES THE COMPANIES THAT DO NOT WANT TO PUT UP I DO NOT SO LINK MUST UNDERGO POPPED UP TODAY TERRY AS TO WHETHER OTHER COMPANIES WOULD HAVE. THAT AT LEAST SOME REPORTERS AND LAW FIRMS ARE INTERPRETING THAT IS OPTIONAL- SO IDEALLY CONSUMERS WHEN HAVE TO OPT OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE OF THE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WOULD BE. AUTOMATIC BUT AT THE VERY LEAST THIS OP DOC SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR AND SIMPLE AND THE BALANCE OF ITS A BIGGER SO FAST. SECONDS THE BILL INITIATIVE IMPROPERLY LAWS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COMBINE DATA- RECEIVE FROM OTHER COMPANIES SERVICE WRITERS SHOULD BE WORKING FOR JUST ONE COMPANY AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SIR THE WRITERS THIS COULD BE GOOGLE THIS ME FACEBOOK- SALES FORCE THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO. FILL THESE HUGE CROSS A DATA SIDES JUST WHILE THE RULES AND ALLOWS THEM TO DROP IN MORE DETAIL INSIGHTS INTO CONSUMERS. AND FINALLY THE BALLOT SHOULD HAVE MRS A KEY OPPORTUNITY TO. REMOVE INAPPROPRIATE LANGUAGE FROM THE C. CPA THAT COULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO CHARGE CONSUMERS FOR EXERCISING THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS- THIS WAS PARTICULARLY DISAPPOINTING FOR US- I CONSUMER REPORTS WE WERE ABLE TO DEVELOP- CONSENSUS LANGUAGE. WITH RETAILERS IN WASHINGTON STATE FOR THEIR WASHING A PRIVACY ACT- THROUGH CLARIFY THAT- PURSUANT TO LOYALTY PROGRAMS- THAT. DATA CAN BE SOLD WITH THIRD PARTIES. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY IS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ADDRESS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US ON. OUR NEXT TO ON THE LINE WE HAVE MERRY ROSS FROM M. S. R. STRATEGIES- MISS ROSS ARE YOU ON THE LINE.

BE ABLE THE INITIATIVE WHAT IT. PRIVACY A NUMBER OF. IT ALSO FALLS OF PROVIDING NEED PROTECTION DEVELOPER AND BUT- BE. CERTAIN PRODUCTION. WE ARE THAT THE INITIATIVE WOULD BE AS WE IT FOR A ON AND FOR. IMPORTANT AND MAKE IT ATTORNEY JOB EASIER REMOVING OUT. ON A OPINIONS I'M NOT PERMITTING FOR TO CARE IT OPENS UP THE POSSIBILITY OF AN FOURTH BY LOOK GOVERNMENT. THE WATER NOT OFFER A FULL PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IT DOESN'T AND THE BILL TO SAY. AND CASES DATA WHEN PASSWORDS AND SECURITY QUESTION ARC. AND CONSUMERS ARE TOO OFTEN READ PASSWORDS THAT MULTI SERVICES AND BUSINESSES USED SAME IF NOT I DON'T SECURITY. I THINK A BRIDGE CAN TAKEN MULTI TIMES. RENTS MUST GO BEYOND TO NOTICE AND CONSENT IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO BE BASED ON THE CONCEPT THAT CAN THANK MUST BE MEANINGFUL. THE INITIATIVE WOULD CLARIFY THE CONTENT MUST BE FREELY GIVEN SPECIFIC INFORMED UNAMBIGUOUS AND CONTENT DOESN'T COUNT IF IT IS TO GENERAL TERMS OR PAINTER DARK PATTERN. WE THINK FUNDING AND IN THIRD ALSO A STEP FORWARD WE ARE NOT AGAINST WHETHER NEW AGENCY OR BETTER. OFF WITHIN THE OF. IT'S PAST. ADDRESS THAT BUT I THERE'S ADEQUATELY OF FUN. CERTAINLY IT'S MORE THAN THE DATA QUO. BUT TEN NINE DOLLARS IS WHAT THAN HALF OF WHAT THE OUR PRIVATE THE REGULAR IN YOUR POP FOR THEIR POP. IN SOME PLACES IN. MRS MARK. RUSSIA CONCERN AT THIS IS TO BECOME AND THE LAW OF THE LAND. THAT POINT NOT MUCH HAPPENED A YEAR IN THE PAST OF THE STANDARD. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A LOT IS GOING TO HAPPEN FALLING INITIATIVE. WE GOT TO GO ABOUT THE TO MANAGE THAT INDIVIDUALS MAY DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT IS PRO PRIVACY. AS THE INITIATIVE EXPLICITLY STATE THAT AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE MADE WITH ATTENTION TO THE IMPACT AND BUSINESS INNOVATION SO LONG OF PRIVACY IS NOT WE GET. IN TERMS SAID I BELIEVE CONTINUE TO HEAR RECENTLY AS THIS WEEK. THAT THIS BILL IT WOULD IMPROVE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHTS FOR MINOR. THE BILL DOES OFFER NEW SEVEN PROTECT. THE FOR WANT TO BUILD AND TEENS IT INCREASE PENALTIES FOR BY. INCLUDE THEM. BUT DOES NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CHAT AND TEAMS THAT HAVE A GREAT. ALSO PROTECTION DRUNKEN DOT COLLECTION AND INTERFACE. WHAT INCLUDING DATA MEN. AT ALL A STEP FORWARD. WE APPRECIATE THE DUTY TO MINIMIZE EXTENDS TO COLLECTION USE PROTECTION AND SHARING A DUTY TO MINIMIZE SHOULD BE TIED TO A CONSUMERS REASONABLE EXPECTATION. NOT TO BUSINESSES PURPOSE WHICH A CONSUMER MAY NOT UNDERSTAND OR FRANKLY EVEN BE AWARE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WICKS'S BELL THREE ONE ONE NINE WHAT A PROVIDED STRONGER PROTECTION HERE. THERE ARE ALSO NUMEROUS NO EXCEPTIONS THAT ALLOW COMPANIES TO IGNORE CONSUMER CLASS BASED ON COMPANY DETERMINE DECISIONS ABOUT SECURITY AND INTEGRITY DISPROPORTIONATE EFFORT OR TRADE SECRETS. THIS COULD CURTAIL CONSUMER THE TIME TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO DELETE AND RIGHT NOW INTENTIONALLY WEAKENING CURRENCY CPA. AND CERTAIN DEFINITION HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN WAYS THAT DO NOT ADVANCE CONSUMER PRIVACY ONE THAT HAD TAKEN UP A LOT OF TIME SO FAR IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. I'VE NOTED THIS FALLS OUTSIDE OF ANY PRIVACY PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW. AND IT TO BE MUCH MORE BROADLY DEFINED. UNDER THE INITIATIVE THE TVPA DEFINED PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AS WAFFLING MADE AVAILABLE BY THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT INCLUDING BIOMETRICS. UNDER THE INITIATIVE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INCLUDE QUOTE INFORMATION BUSINESS HAS A REASONABLE BASIS TO BELIEVE IS LAWFULLY MADE AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC I THE CONSUMER OR FROM WIDELY DISTRIBUTED MEDIA. OR BY THE CONSUMER. OR INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE BY A PERSON TO WHOM THE CONSUMER HAD. TO THEY BROUGHT IN SOME WHAT CAN TO. AND WE WERE THAT A LOT OF. IN INVER LEISURE ONLINE BY CAN SEE COULD BE EVEN UPPER. FOR ENABLING KLAY STYLE SCRAPING THE PROFILE BUILDING IT THE MORE HAS NOT THAT THERE'S CRACK. AND CONSTITUTIONAL CAN. ARE BETTER DRESSED THROUGH JOHN AND OTHER. SUCH AS A AGREE TO BUY AND GROUP LAST YEAR THAT WHAT HAS ALLOWED. BILL TO AND INFORMATION INTENT MADE AVAILABLE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SIMMER BE A MATCH MEDIA. ULTIMATELY AS YOU'RE HEARING TODAY THEN DOES NUMBER OF THINGS IN THE AREA CONSUMER. AND WE'RE PLEASED WITH THAT ASPECT OF IT THAT ARE STEP FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE INITIATIVE WANT ADEQUATELY PROTECT CONSUMERS INCLUDING CHILDREN AND TEENS. AND I'M THE GUY THAT THE LEGISLATURE MUST CONTINUE TO BE DONE GEN AND I THINK PRIVACY WHETHER THIS INITIATIVE ENACTED OR NOT FOR YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A CHANCE AND FOR YOUR- OUR NEXT WILL. FROM OUR- REPRESENTATIVES. WITH THE RACHEL MICHELIN OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION. AND SHE HAS JOINED US IN PERSON TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US- THIS A MICHELIN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M RACHEL MICHELIN PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND IWANNA THANK YOU. YOUR STAFF IN THE SERGEANTS HERE FOR MAKING THIS I'M HERE IMPOSSIBLE TODAY. WITH THIS BODY PASSED THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WAS VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND PARTICULARLY YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER HERTZBERG M. MISTER DODD. TAKE THE INITIATIVE OFF THE BALLOT. WE BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATION AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS BEFORE A BOWL TO ANY INITIATIVE THAT LOCKS THE LOT IN. WITH VIRTUALLY NO ABILITY TO BE A- THE END OF THE HEINZ EASY P. WHICH STARTED WITH A COP PARTY COM. WITH I BY OTHER ISSUES WERE MAKING HEADLINES HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH RETAILERS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF INFORMATION WE HAVE IS ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS. THOSE ARE PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES FOR MATH. CCPA PUTS THE BRUNT OF THE REGULATION ON CONSUMER FACING BUSINESSES. EVEN THOUGH THE PREPONDERANCE OF DATA PROCESSING IS DONE BY OTHERS. SYRIAN HAVE ALWAYS CONCERN. ABOUT PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF OUR CUSTOMERS OUR ENTIRE SIX ASSN RETAIL WITH THE COMPETITION IS BASED ON OUR CONSUMER RELATIONSHIPS. AT THE VAST MAJORITY OF INFORMATION WE HAVE IS ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS AND WHAT THEY PURCHASE AND THE SERVICES THEY GET. BUT THEIR CCPA PUTS THE BRUNT OF REGULATION OUR CUSTOMER FACING BUSINESSES EVEN THOUGH THINGS ARE DONE BY OTHER PEOPLE. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF CCPA RETAILERS HAVE SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS MORE DOLLARS WORKING ON COMPLIANCE AND THAT SPENDING CONTINUES NOW THAT THE AGES REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN FINALIZED. MEMBERS ARE NOT ANTI PRIVACY WE ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE. I WAS THE LAWS IN THE NATION CCPA BUT WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE C. P. R. EIGHT BECAUSE IT IS A FLEXIBLE AND IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE. FOR THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS AT A TIME WHEN WE CAN ILL AFFORD IT. SEE IF YOU'RE A HAVE A PROVISION THAT ONLY PROVIDES FOR AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE INITIATIVE. WELL THIS SOUNDS APPEALING ON ITS FATE. IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR ANY FLEXIBILITY WHICH COULD BE NEEDED AS TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS FOR CRISIS DEMANDS. THIS IS NERVOUS. BEING. I DO AND NGUYEN CPR IS DRAFTED WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THE NINETEEN. WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT SOCIAL DISTANCING. WE COULD HAVE COMPREHENDED A TIME WHEN WALKING INTO THE CAPITAL WE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A HEALTH SCREENING FOR HAVE A TEMPERATURE TAKEN. MOST OF US HAD NEVER TALKED ABOUT CONTACT TRACING. AND I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CONTACT TRACING IN PARTICULAR. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT PRIVACY WITH THOSE WITH CONTACT TRACING THERE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE. BUT THE GOVERNOR JUST ANNOUNCED THE CALIFORNIA CONNECTED PROGRAM. SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CONTACT TRACING. WE ARE FOLLOWING COUNTIES I'VE BEEN ON THE STATE WHO ARE USING TECHNOLOGY TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYERS TO REPORT HEALTH DATA REGARDING THEIR EMPLOYEES. ALL IN THE NAME OF STOPPING THE SPREAD OF HOPE IT. BUT I WONDER IF CPR A WITH A LOT OF THE WAY ON. WITH THIS PROHIBITS SOME OF THESE CRITICAL ACTIONS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS. TODAY WERE KEENLY AWARE IN THE AWARE HER WORLD CAN CHANGE OVERNIGHT. WALKING INTO THE CAPITAL TODAY I WAS STRUCK I HAVE NOT SEEN STORES BOARDED ACT WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANYTHING IN OUR HISTORY WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE PAST FOUR MONTHS. AND I WONDER. WE HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE OUR LIVES AND OUR LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BE AMENABLE AN ADAPTABLE TO HELP US RESPOND. WE NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY OF OUR LIKE DID OFFICIALS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. UNFORTUNATELY CPR A SIMPLY DOESN'T ALLOW FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. EVEN IF A 100% OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OUR GOVERNOR. READ. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S A CONCERN IS THE CREATION OF WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT OF THE NEW STATE AGENCY. AGAIN AT A TIME WHERE HE'S FACING PAINFUL BUDGET CUTS TO SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE. SHOULD WE REALLY NOW CREATE A NEW AGENCY AND THE NUMEROUS WILL MAKING TO PART MY CPR EIGHT. AS A MOM OF TWO CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM I WANT MY KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. SHOULD MONEY BE SPENT THEY'RE NOT I'M MORE GOVERNMENTAGENCIES ON THIS IT INITIATIVE. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST TO COMPLY. OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS ESSENTIAL RETAILERS STOOD UP THEY KEPT THEIR DOORS OPEN THEY ENSURE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICATIONS TO THE GROCERIES THAT THEY NEEDED. NOT A CENTURY THERE'S ARE JUST OPENING. THEN YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO OPEN LAST WEEKEND AND WERE ABLE TO BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES GOING ON IN THE STATE. SADLY AND I'M SURE YOU'VE READ. THE HEADLINES THERE WILL BE RETAILERS THAT WILL NOT OPEN THEIR DOORS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THOSE WHO DO. THERE RESOURCES SHOULD BE SPENT PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S BACK TO WORK KEEPING THEIR POISON CUSTOMER SAFE INSTEAD THIS INITIATIVE PASSES WE'LL HAVE TO SPEND MILLIONS ON COMPLIANCE AND PRIVACY ATTORNEYS. FINALLY THE OTHER ISSUES THE MORATORIUM ON EMPLOYEE AND BUSINESS BUSINESS INFORMATION. WHICH ON ITS FACE SEEMS HELP ON THE INITIATIVE BUT WE'RE ON CERTAIN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO DO ON THOSE ISSUES AFTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO. YOUR HANDS MAY BE TIED. ON REASONABLE MEASURES TO PROTECT EMPLOYEE PRIVACY. MISTER CHAIR. YOUR LEADERSHIP. ON THIS. ON THIS IF YOU LAST YEAR. WITH SO VITALLY IMPORTANT. WE FULLY SUPPORT YOUR CONTINUED WORK ON THIS ISSUE. WE NEED ANOTHER EXTENSION OF A SENSE THAT NOW. THE INITIATIVE TO GOT TO QUALIFY AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOOD WILL BE A VOTERS IN NOVEMBER. FINALLY CZ PA JUST WENT INTO A FACT. THE INK ON THE ON THE REGULATIONS ISN'T EVEN DRY. YET WE AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO GIVE THE TIME FOR THIS POLICY FOR CCPA TO WORK. IF THERE ARE DEFICIENCIES LET'S WORK TOGETHER THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO FIX THAT. WE ENCOURAGE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TO DO ALL YOU CAN DO TAKE THIS OFF THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AND PUSH IT TOWARDS TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. LET'S NOT LOCK IN AN UNAVAILABLE OFF THAT IS UNFATHOMABLE I THIS TIME IN OUR- THE YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSING. FOR YOUR TEST. ON EXCEL IT'S TO LOWER CURTIS FROM CA TI BELIEVE SHE ON THE LINE. MISTER CURTIS SO YOU'LL LIGHTING. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER AND MEMBERS OF THE MY IS FOR AND I'M HERE ON THE OF THE CAN TECH INTO THIRTY BLEEDING AT FOR THE GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY WE ARE GRATEFUL TO YOUR STAFF FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON THE CPR A INITIATIVE. TODAY I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON FOUR POINTS FIRST THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AT COMPLEXITY TO AN ALREADY COMPLEX LOT BEFORE BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS EVEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE EPA REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE CITY PA HAVEN'T EVEN GONE INTO EFFECT YET. WELL THE AP CAN BEGIN IMPORTANT FIFTY P. ON JULY THE REGULATIONS WERE JUST SENT OVER FROM THE EIGHTY TO THE OFFICE OF MINISTRY TO LOG ON TO FIRST IF THE ONLY A X. REVIEW THE REGULAR. AT BY EIGHTEEN COMPANY FOR OF WHAT THAN AND FROM HAVE A SEEN THE REGULATION AND FINAL CAP TO AND THAT HOWEVER THE NUMBER PERCENT POTENTIAL FOR MONTHS THE AGE IMPORT OF THE EASY PAY. MOTOR THINK HOW WILL VOTING ON TO CHIU THE PER WE PRIDE LAWS. HI IT SHOULD BE THE MAIN GOAL OF ANY LAW. BUT CERTAINLY ONE THAT IS AS COMPLEX AS A CITY PA. AND NOW THE CPR A- THIRD THE BALLOT INITIATIVE CREATE THE NEW IMPORTANT AGENCY WHICH HAS NO TRACK RECORD. THIS NEW AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION IT. WOULD ABSORB THE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY GRANTED UNDER THE ACT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. IF ADOPTED BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS NEWMAN MODIFIED OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CPR A WOULD NOT ENTER INTO FORCE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS IS THE EIGHTY WOULD HAVE SEVERAL YEARS AT THE HELM BEFORE THE NEW AGENCY TAKES OVER. THE AG SHOULD NOT BE THE PLANET ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO. NUMBERS AND THE- HIGHER LEAN. TO GET UP TO SPEED CONSIDERING THE AGES AT THE MOMENT THUS FAR. ADDITIONALLY THE CREATION OF A NEW AGENT IS A VERY COSTLY STATE. FINISHED PART FIVE DOLLAR. AND REFINE. FIRST YEAR AND THEN. CURRENTLY BEING BECAUSE OF KOBE DISTRICT OR EVEN MORE CONCERNED WITH IS A ESPECIALLY GIVEN LIMITS THE INITIATIVE AMENDED BILL WHICH IS MY LAST POINT THE INITIAL ONLY A ALLEGE TO ACTIVE IT BETTER PRIVACY OR THAN FURTHERANCE OF THE PURPOSE INTENT OF THE LAW IS. THAT ME BIOLAGE WITH THE- FOR STATE TO BE HEARD BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF AMEND ABILITY BUILT INTO THIS INITIATIVE. THE LEGISLATURE WILL NOT HAVE FULL DISCRETION TO MAKE THE CHANGES TO THE LAW. IT COVERT HAS TAUGHT US ANYTHING IT'S THAT EVERYTHING IS UNPREDICTABLE THIS INITIATIVE WILL STRONG ARM THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO DO. THINGS BEST AS IT RELATES TO PRIVACY EVEN IN TIMES OF CRISIS. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED TODAY AND DISCUSS THE CONCERNS CONST PUMP YEAH AND IF MEMBERS HAVE WITH THIS INITIATIVE.

AND PROFIT FOR TOOK FOR THE IN. AND LIVE SO WITH THESE YOU CAN REQUIREMENTS AND TAKE ANOTHER EXAMPLE. CREATE A NEW CATEGORY OF PURSUANT TO ON A SENSITIVE ONE. WHICH IS REGULATED IN A MANNER DIFFERENT THAN PERSONAL INFORMATION THE FIRST REQUIRES BUSINESSES TO TREAT- P. I. N. S. P. I HAVE SEPARATE CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION. THAT CREATES ADDITIONAL BURDENS ON BUSINESSES ARE REQUIRING THEM TO CREATE PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO IDENTIFY AND SEPARATE THOSE TWO TYPES OF INFORMATION AND THE- EARLY STORM CATEGORIZE THAT INFORMATION. AND THE STOCKS ARE OF COURSE TIME CONSUMING TEDIOUS AND COSTLY SO IN SOME- WE JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE CHANGES TO HELP PROVIDE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF- WHY COMPLIANCE YOUR DOES COME AT A COST. THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. BURDENS DISCUSSION WE APPRECIATE THIS COULD BE SHOPPERS APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH% MISTER MUHAMMAD FOR YOUR TESTIMONY FIND OUT MR THANK GOD. FROM THE NOT FEDERATION OF IN THIS IS. A BILL HE HERE PHYSICAL. WELCOME IN YOU FOR YOUR- YEAH THANKS VERY MISTER CHAIR A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TO THE COMMITTEE I AM JOHN CAP TECH I AM SERVING AS THE STATE DIRECTOR THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF AND IT THIS THE NFIB- IT IS MY PLEASURE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS IS REPRESENTED BY THE NFIB. AND I'M OR ALSO PART OF A COALITION OF OTHER LEADING SMALL AND ETHNIC BUSINESS FROM ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE NUMEROUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS ACT. OF ALL THE INITIAL WILL IMPOSE ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND PERSONAL. MY BUSINESSES FAR TOO OF WHICH RIGHT NOW AS WE ALL KNOW ARE NOT SURE OF THEIR SURVIVAL PROSPECTS. SECOND IT ESTABLISHES A NEW GOVERNMENT AGENCY AT THE TIME WHEN THE STATE IS FACING A CRASHING BUT DEFICIT. AND THIRD IT LIMITS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL AMENDMENTS EVEN WHEN PROBLEMS BECOME APPARENT. SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND OPERATORS IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING PERSON CUSTOMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION. NOBODY WANTS TO MAKE HAVE THEIR INFORMATION GET INTO THE WRONG HANDS. SINCE THE CCPA IN SUBSEQUENT N. AND IT'S A PASSED OUR MEMBERS AND MANY OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SHOULDERING THE COSTLY BURDEN OF IMPLEMENTING THE TECHNOLOGICAL AND OPERATIONAL MEASURES. NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. ALSO AT THE BUSINESSES ARE DOING THEIR BEST RIGHT NOW TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINAL REGULATIONS MADE AVAILABLE ABOUT A WEEK AGO A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO. FOR IN PERSON AT GAINES JUST TWO WEEKS FROM NOW. BUT THERE IS MASSIVE CONFUSION ABOUT THE LAW REGULATIONS AND THE MEASURES THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO COMPLY. AND MANY FRANKLY SIMPLY AREN'T EVEN FOCUSED ON THAT RIGHT NOW THANKS TO THE DEMOCRATS THIS. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE THE FEDERAL LOAN PROCESS AND FRANKLY OTHER WORKPLACE RULES TO GET THEIR LIGHTS TURNED. PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THE COST OF THE SEAT. ON THE TREMENDOUS. THE SECOND THAT AS HIS MADE OUT PREPARE. FOR THE ATTORNEY ROSE UP TO MAKE THE OVERALL COMPLAIN COSTS TO THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AT ABOUT. DOLLARS BUT FOR WHAT ENGINE IS THE- IN A SMALL BIT IS ABOUT THE THOUSAND DOLLARS. MEAN MANY OF THESE BIG HAVE BEEN SHATTERED SINCE MARCH AND MANY REMAIN BOARDED UP TO THIS DAY. PASSAGE OF THE C. C. C. PUPPY ARE A WILL REQUIRE BUSINESS OWNERS TO REVISE THEIR PRIVACY PROGRAMS ONCE AGAIN AND TAKE ON NEW UNFORESEEN COST. THIS MEASURE ALSO PROPOSES ESTABLISHING AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED A NEW ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT. NOW PROPONENTS MAY CLAIM THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BUT BUSINESS OWNERS AND TAXPAYERS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO FOOT THE BILL. FOR THE BUDGET SHORTFALL FOR MANY YEARS- AND- TO PREPARE TO PROPOSE ANY NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM OR AGENCY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC CRISIS WHEN THE STATE IS CONSIDERING ASSIVE CUTS AS YOU POINTED OUT MISTER CHAIRMAN TO ME GETTING THAT PROGRAMS. IS ONLY IN A- AND HIGHLY INSENSITIVE CHALLENGES THAT ARE IN BUSINESSES PARTICULARS. AND FOR IF WE'VE LEARNED ANY THROUGH THE CCPA EXPERIENCE IT'S THAT THESE LAWS REQUIRE IMMENSE THOUGHT CONSIDERATION AND AN ENTIRE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE SESSION TO MAKE THEM WORKABLE. IF THE LAW GOES TO THE BALLOT AND PASSES THIS INITIATIVE IN MANY WAYS IS GOING TO TIE THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE. WE BELIEVE THAT MOST PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRIVACY POLICY REALIZE THAT LIMITING THE LEGISLATURE'S PART OF POWER TO AMEND THE LAW WILL BE PROBLEMATIC. LOSING GIVEN THE GO WITH- BRING THE COVE IN NINETEEN CRISIS AND ITS IMPACT ON SMALL BUSINESS AND THE FACT THAT THE FINAL REGULATIONS FOR THE ORIGINAL PRIVACY LAW HAVE YET TO TAKE EFFECT. WE ARE SIMPLY ASKING FOR MORE TIME FOR THIS MEASURE. AS AS EVEN THE SPONSOR HAS REALIZED THE DISRUPTION OF KOBE NINETEEN IN HIS OWN FILING PROCESS. SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN FURTHER AVOID KIRK NEAL FURTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGE ON OUR NUMBER ONE JOB CREATORS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS TRYING TO CRAWL OUT OF THE HOLE. RIGHT NOW DURING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME AND TO RECOVER. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY CANNOT AFFORD ADDITIONAL COST OR CONFUSION AS THE STATE BEGINS TO RE OPEN OUR FOR THE CON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY. UP I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS% WHO HAVE TESTIFIED. FOR US TODAY AND SOCIAL DISTANCING HAS. TRULY MADE THIS PROCESS A LOT MORE LOCAL AND WE OF. SERVICE THE POPE. FOR I OPEN. QUESTION TO A QUESTION IS FOR CANNOT. I LIKE TO ASK YOU ANY WHO. TO CALL IN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO DIAL IN NOW. AND THERE CAN BE A DELAY WITH THE PHONE LINES AND CALLING IN EARLY WILL HELP THE PROCESS GO SMOOTHLY. AND AGAIN THE NUMBER TO CALL IN IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR. TWO ZERO TWO. YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL AS OR AS WELL AS ON YOUR TV SCREEN. I LIKE TO- START OFF WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT MAY BE THE FIRST ONE I'D LIKE TO DIRECT TO THE- CONSUMER OBVIOUS- ADVOCACY REPRESENTATIVES. OF THE INITIATIVE INCLUDES SECURITY AND INTEGRITY WITHIN THE DEFINITION OF BUSINESS PURPOSE. TO INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF A BUSINESS. TO ENSURE THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF NATURAL PERSONS. NOW HISTORICALLY SAFETY AND SECURITY HAVE BEEN USED AS A AS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR INVASIVE SURVEILLANCE OF INDIVIDUALS. ENSURING PHYSICAL SAFETY COULD BE CONSTRUED TO INCLUDE THE COLLECTION OF HIGHLY PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS YOUR LOCATION AND PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS EVEN WHEN THOSE ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE OPERATIONAL PURPOSES OF THE BUSINESS. THE QUESTION IS DO YOU SEE THE ABILITY TO COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ENSURE THE PHYSICAL SAFETY OF NATURAL PERSONS IN THIS MEASURE BEING USED IN A WAY THAT WILL COMPROMISE INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY. CONSUMERS WAITING ON THIS ISSUE SO I'M SURE. YOU'RE FREE TO DO SO PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES IT'S HARD TO COORDINATE REMOTELY- I'M SORRY ALEX COMMONSENSE. EIGHT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE RE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED- ARE MOST CONCERNED WITH ENSURING PHYSICAL SAFETY OF NATURAL PERSON THOUGH ALL OF THESE EXCEPTIONS COULD BE READ PROBABLY BYCOMPANIES WERE ALL TURNED. OUT OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DEATH SUCH AS DETECT SECURITY INCIDENTS RESISTING MALICIOUS DECEPTIVE FRAUDULENT PROSECUTING PEOPLE ON THESE CAN HAVE ALL BEEN VERY BROADLY INTERPRETED BY BUSINESSES IN THE PAST AND THAT IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE TO CHALLENGE A BUSINESS THAT THEY CLAIM NOT SORT OF EXCEPTION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHIME IN AWESOME AS WELL MAHONEY. FINE ALL RIGHT THE NEXT QUESTION I LIKE TO DIRECT TO THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES- ANY OF THE FOUR INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE INVITED TO RESPOND. THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE INITIALLY TASK THE AG WOULD PROMULGATING REGULATIONS UNTIL THE PROPOSED AGENCY HAS INDICATED ITS CAPACITY TO TAKE OVER THAT RESPONSIBILITY. IS THERE A RISK THAT REGULATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE AG MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR ENFORCEMENT BY THE AGENCY. FOLLOW UP CAN BUSINESSES BE CONFIDENT THAT REGULATIONS CREATED BY THE AG WILL BE HONOR BY AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE CREATED BY THE AGENCY. COULD UNCERTAINTY OVER THIS TRANSITION BE PROBLEMATIC. FOR THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH THE MEASURE I KNOW IT'S A LONG QUESTION I SO LET ME REPEAT THAT QUESTION. THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE INITIALLY TOSSED AG WITH PROMULGATINGREGULATIONS UNTIL THE PROPOSED AGENCY HAS INDICATED ITS CAPACITY TO TAKE OVER THAT RESPONSIBILITY. IS THERE A RISK THAT REGULATIONS DEVELOP IDG MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OR THE ENFORCEMENT BY THE AGENCY. FOLLOW UP QUESTION CAN BUSINESSES BE CONFIDENT THAT REGULATIONS CREATED BY THE AG WILL BE HONORED BY AND CONSISTENT WITH THOSE CREATED BY THE AGENCY AND FINALLY. COULD UNCERTAINTY OVER THIS TRANSITION BE PROBLEMATIC. FOR THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH THE MEASURE. SO ANY PART OF THE- QUESTIONS FEEL FREE TO CHIME IN A WITH YOU HAVE A RESPONSE. AT RETAIL MICHELIN WITH THE RETAILERS I THINK THAT FROM A RETAIL PERSPECTIVE OUR MEMBERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CLARITY THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY. WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR BUSINESS AND PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO PRIVACY SO I THINK IN LOOKING BACK ON THE PROCESS THAT WE DID WITH AG REGULATIONS THAT WAS A LONG PROCESS I THINK WE STARTED IT END OF LAST YEAR. AGAIN THAT THE RAGS ONLY FINAL REX CAME OUT BUT TWO WEEKS AGO. AT SO I THINK THAT THERE IS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN GUARANTEE THAT CONTINUITY WITH THE AGENCY THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO WILL BE PART OF THAT HELLO REALLY FUNCTION. SO THERE BE AYE THE BIGGEST CONCERN WOULD BE OPENING UP TO LIABILITY I THINK OPENING UP TO LAWSUITS AND WE'VE ARE SEEN EVEN THE CPA L. PEOPLE READY TO SUE PARTICULARLY SMALLER BUSINESSES THIS WAS JUST TRYING TO COMPLY. AND I THINK EVERYTHING IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AGAIN THISWE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH DIFFERENT CONVERSATION FOUR MONTHS AGO. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE WILL BE IN. THE WAY TODAY. I THINK THAT YOU KNOW. BEING ABLE GO EXACTLY WHAT THE RULES ARE SO WEAK COMPLY RETAILERS AND BUSINESS IN GENERAL. THAT THE DOT FIRST. I WOULD SEE SOME. TO HER AND THEN TO TURN AND HAVE TO RE TO NEW ELATION BECAUSE OF INITIAL pI THINK IT BE DOCTOR TO A LOT OF THESE IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO CHIME IN. IT ONLINE OR IF PHYSICALLY HERE. MISTER CAP THAT FOR FREE. THIS TERMINATE I THINK THE REIGNING WORD HERE THAT WE KEEP HEARING NOT JUST AGAIN FROM THE INDUSTRY BUT FROM SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE IS UNCERTAINTY- LACK OF CLARITY- AND WE'RE FINDING THAT RIGHT NOW IN THIS SITUATION WITH CODE AMONG SO MANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES THERE CAN STEP CONSUMERS- SO PEOPLE REALLY DON'T KNOW BUT I THINK ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING THINGS WE I HEARD THIS MORNING WAS IN THE LEGISLATIVE AT- REPRESENT WHO SAID EIGHT. THE TOTAL IMPACT OF THIS AUDIT THIS PROPOSAL ALONE THIS NEW ONE IS UNKNOWN AND SHE ALSO SAID IT WAS UNCLEAR HOW BUSINESSES WILL ADJUST SO AGAIN EVEN THE LEGISLATIVE THE NON PARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S IS TALKING ABOUT THE LACK OF CLARITY AND UNCERTAINTY AS WE LOOK AHEAD IF PEOPLE WILL IT THAT'S WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE AND THAT'S ABOUT THE NEW PROPOSAL THIS HAS YET TO GO INTO EFFECT- AND NOT EVEN THE FIRST THEN THE FIRST WILL BE ORIGINAL CCPA WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN. YET SO THE WHAT THE WORD UNCERTAINTY COMES INTO QUESTION QUITE A BIT I MEAN IT IS A BIG TURN WITH US RIGHT NOW IS NOBODY REALLY UNDER AND KNOWS ISN'T ALREADY LIVING IN A FULL TIME RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO AND THAT CONTRACT SO THE FEED THE ACCOUNT. JOBS BUT THE BACK OF CERTAINTY IS SOMETHING LA. SO MANY. AND THAT'S ANY RIGHT NOW SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE- BECAUSE- AS THIS IS THIS IS CONSIDERED. THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH ANYBODY ON THE LINE LIKE TO THAT. PART OF THE. HEARING NONE LEFT SO- ASK A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS SO THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR ANY PALESTINIAN OF THE PALACE IN GENERAL FIRST QUESTION CONSIDERING THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO AMEND THE CONTENT OF A BALLOT INITIATIVE AND THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. WHAT MAKES A BALLOT INITIATIVE RATHER THAN A LEGISLATIVE SOLUTION THE APPROPRIATE MECHANISM FOR REALIZING THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE. THIS IS FOR ANY OF THE PANELISTS. I THINK. I AM JUST ONE THAT YOU RESTATE MY PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT AT THAT POINT IN TIME I DON'T THINK THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS THE PROPER MECHANISM THAT I THINK THAT WE BOUGHT THE IN HOW COMPLICATED THE PROCESS AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE RATHER RENT THROUGH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE PROCESS. THANK YOU. MISS MITCHELL EVERY TO MECHELEN RETAILERS I AGREE WITH WHAT THAT THE PREVIOUSLY I THINK MERRY JUST SAD AND YOU KNOW WE JUST WENT THROUGH A PROCESS I THINK THE LEGISLATURE- WAS VERY WISE IN PUSHING CCPA THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I THINK THAT PROCESS IS IMPORTANT- ARE LEGISLATORS ARE ELECTED OUR GOVERNOR IS ELECTED. AND I THINK THAT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE GOOD DIALOGUE FROM BOTH SIDES IN LAST YEAR THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PRIVACY BILLS THAT THAT WE'VE MADE A LOT OF CONSENSUS ON WE WORKED ON AND THEN AS WE WORKED WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR AND UNDER YOUR LEADERSHIP. I JUST THINK THE PROCESS FRIEND A GOOD PUBLIC POLICY THE EMPLOYEE IS THE BEST WAY TO GO THEY PUTTING IT IN A BONTA BALLET WHERE. WE WILL SO MANY OF THEM ON THE BALLOT. CONSUMERS AND VOTERS MAY NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR WHAT THEY'RE NOT VOTINGFOR. THANK YOU. OKAY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF CONSUMER REPORTS WERE NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE ABOUT WHETHER NOT ADVANCE ON PRIVACY PROTECTIONS WOULD BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE OR THROUGH THE BALLOT ONE THING WE DO APPRECIATE ABOUT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS IT WOULD INCLUDE A PROVISION- THAT WOULD MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO FOR THE FOR THE WEEKEND THE LAW. THIS BECAME REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATIVE SESSION WHEN- RAFT OF BILLS WERE INTRODUCED IN ORDER TO WEAKEN THE CPA ALTHOUGH THE WORST OF THE BILL'S MORE STOPS- YOU KNOW THERE WERE LOOPHOLES THAT WERE CREATED AND- ALL THE BILLS INTRODUCED TO AND IMPROVE THE MEASURE- IN TERMS OF PRIVACY FAIL TO ADVANCE- SO WE THINK THAT'S A AN ASPECT ABOUT THE SHIFT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ON THE LINE TO RESPOND. HEARING AND SEEING NONE OF AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO- GIVE MISTER MCTAGGART A CHANCE TO PERHAPS RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED- AND- AFTER A FEW FEW MINUTES PRODUCT PERHAPS IF YOU DON'T MIND- YOU KNOW I'LL LET YOU MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH ISSUE LIKE TOURIST RESPONDED SHALL TO TRY TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THEM IN ORDER. SURE WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS COMBINING DATE AND THAT BEING INAPPROPRIATE WE DO HAVE A REGULATION. ALL READ IT- ISSUE REGULATIONS IDENTIFYING THOSE BUSINESS PURPOSES. FOR WHICH SERVICE WRITERS MAY USE CONSUMERS P. I RECEIVE PURSUANT TO RID CONTRA BUSINESS. FOR THE FOR THE SERVICE WRITER THE CONTRACTORS OWN BUSINESS PURPOSE WITH THE GOAL OF MAXIMIZING CONSUMER PRIVACY SO WE DID THINK ABOUT THAT. WE THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED IT BY SPECIFIC REGULATION ASKING FOR THAT. IN TERMS OF SABOTAGING THE EXISTING LAW YOU KNOW I HAVE TO KINDA LAUGHED BUT THINKING THAT I WOULD SPEND A LOT OF MONEY DOING THE FIRST LAW. AND THEN WOULD CONSCIOUSLY TRY TO SABOTAGE THE SECOND ALMOST ANY MORE TIME AND MONEY DOING IT. YOU KNOW IF THAT CRITICISM IS THAT I TALKED TO GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK EXPERIENCE WELL GUILTY AS CHARGED I'LL TO TALK TO EFF. WAS REYES CLEARING HOUSE ACLU. COMMONSENSE THE DOCTOR ACADEMICS THE DEAN OF THE CAN THE BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL. AB PROFESSES A BERKELEY ORGANIZED BROWN TABLE FOR ME TO TALK TO E. REGULATORS LKE THE FEDERAL REGULATORS THE PROFESSOR I MEAN I. CENTER HERTZBERG AND I TALKED TO EVERYBODY. IN FACT WE TALKED BUSINESS ABSOLUTELY THERE STAKEHOLDERS TO IN TERMS OF- THE AGENCY BEING UNDER FUNDED PAPER TIGER. YOU KNOW COMPARING THE BUDGET OF TEN MILLION TO THE FTC'S BUT IF YOUR NAME IS DIRECTOR FRANK RIDICULOUS. THE FTC HAS MANY MORE RESPONSIBILITIES AND JUST PRIVACY. THIS WOULD HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF PRIVACY PROFESSIONALS RIGHT NOW IS THE FD AS FTC HAS FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. SO THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE RIGHT- COMPARISON AS I SAID BEFORE IF IT'S NOT ENOUGH. THE LEGISLATURE IN ITS WISDOM CAN VOTE MORE. THE ISSUE IS JUST THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT IT FROM BEING DEFINED OF LIKE GOVERNOR BROWN DID IN TWENTY TWELVE. IN TERMS OF LABOR UNIONS DO WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY I TALK TO SEAL S. YEAH YOU CAL FED. THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY GOT THEIR INPUT AND THEY SUPPORTED THIS THREE YEAR- A WINDOW SO CLEARLY- WITH CENTER HERTZBERG- DISSIPATION WE TALKED ALL THE NEWS AND KEPT THEM ON ON THE ON SITE. TERMS UNDER MIND EIJI NO WE'RE SIMPLY RE ASSIGNING THE RULE MAKING AUTHORITY TO KEEP THE SAME ROLE WORKING THIRTY. ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THAT BUT GIVE IT TO A NEW AGENCY- TERMS WITH OPTIONAL IT IS NO LOOPHOLE WITH OPTIONAL IF THEY WANTED TO EARLIER THERE IS NO OPTION ALREADY. BUSINESSES HAVE TO RESPECT WE DO NOT SELL SIGNAL NO MATTER WHICH WAY THEY GO. IN TERMS OF DE IDENTIFIED BEING A LOOPHOLE MY GOODNESS I HAVE- AGAIN US ABOUT- EMAIL CHAIN FOR SUPPORT FROM YES. ACLU AND COMMON- AND CONSUMER REPORTS SIGNING OFF ON OUR DEFINITION OF DE IDENTIFIED THE REASON HAD TO BE CHANGED IS BECAUSE EXPERT THAT LOOKED. BEST PRACTICE IN DE IDENTIFIED IS THAT YOU THE BUSINESS HAVE TO. ACTUALLY TEST TO RE IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB. I DIDN'T COME FROM ME. EXT AND AGAIN IF YOU HAVE THREE OF THE LEADING PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS APPROVING THE LANGUAGE IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT THAT IS A GIVEAWAY TO BUSINESS. SO AND AS WE WENT THROUGH AND IN IN GREAT DETAIL I MEAN A LOT MORE THAN SEVEN CHANGES FROM THE ADVOCATES LETTER. IN TERMS OF- RETAILERS- THE IT YOU KNOW I THINK THE THING THAT TO REALIZE ABOUT BOTH- CCPA AUNTS AND CPR IT. IS BUSINESSES ARE ALLOWED TO USE THEIR OWN INFORMATION TO DATE THE SYMBOL ON THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT'S AND THEIR CONSUMERS THAT'S IT'S THE SELLING PART THAT'S THAT THAT'S THAT. WE DRAW THE LINE- AND SO. NOW THEY'RE BE A NEW RESTRICTION ON SENSITIVE PERSONAL INFORMATION BUT PRESUMABLY RETAILERS ARE NOT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. MY RELIGION WHEN- THERE COULD FIGURE OUT IF I WANT TO BUY A BLUE TEE SHIRT OR A RED TEE SHIRT- AND- AGAIN IN TERMS OF BOTH. A LOT OF THE RETAILERS A LOT OF THE BUSINESS FOLKS. WE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO TRYING TO EASE THE BURDEN OF COMPLIANCE- HERE AND PRESERVE PRIVACY. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF THE- WHATEVER THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE COVERED BY CCPA. PRESUMABLY BY CLARIFYING THAT IF BUSINESS IS THE JUST BUY AND SELL INFORMATION AS OPPOSED TO. RECEIVE OR SHARE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. AND BY REVERTING TO THE TWENTY REGIONAL TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEFINITION OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND PIECE OF INFORMATION HERE. WERE REALLY SAYING. AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY THE SMALL MOAN POPS WHERE THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. BUT THEY'RE NOT COVERED. AND IF THEY'RE SELLING INFORMATION IS A DIFFERENTPROVISION THE CATCHES THEM SO IT'S SORT LONG AS OUR SMALL- BUSINESS WE REALLY- REDUCE THE COMPLIANCE BURDEN ON THE SMALL BUSINESS- EMPLOYEE PRIVACY THAT CAME UP. AGAIN THAT'S ONE WHERE WE SAID LOOK RETURN THAT OVER THE LEGISLATURE THAT'S COMPLICATED SO IF THIS PASSES YOU'LL HAVE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO SORT OUT THAT- AND AGAIN THAT WAS WITH THE FULL INPUT OF LABOR. HUMAN TALK TO LABOR- USUALLY. IN TURN OF- YOU KNOW THE EDITION OF REGULATIONS. ALL I WOULD SAY IS IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW ONCE THE CAR AND ONE'S A BOAT. CBRE BUILDS ON CCPA SO THE WORK THE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE FOR CPA WILL NOT BE LOST. AND AT THE MARGIN THE NUMBER OF NEW REGULATIONS GOING TO AFFECT ARE NOT GOING TO BE NEARLY. AS SUBSTANTIAL AS GOING FROM NOTHING TO WHERE WE ARE NOW SO- AGAIN WE WERE SENSITIVE TO- IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S BEEN PART OF OUR PROCESS ALL LONG STRIDE IMPROVE WORKABILITY. WHILE TRYING TO PRESERVE PRIVACY AND I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB ON ON THAT HERE- AND- YOU KNOW I THINK AGAIN LIKE TO SENSITIVE INFORMATION CAME UP. WE HAVE A PROVISION HERE SAYING IF YOU'RE NOT COLLECT. INFORMATION AND USING IT AS IT'S AN FROM IT DOESN'T. IT'S NOT COVERED ASSN. TRYING BE REALLY FOR. ABOUT THE MATH. EFFECT LAW. THE PRESERVES AND CONSUMER FOR TO THEM MOST UP. AND ALSO HAS THE EASIEST COMPLAINTS. BECAUSE AGAIN A GOOD LAWS WHEN THAT WILL BE YOU KNOW EASY IMPLEMENT SO- I AM I'M I'M- THANKS FOR ALL THE COMMENTS TODAY BUT- AND THEN FINALLY ON AS TO WHETHER INITIATIVE IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE. I'VE BEEN OVER THAT I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT TIME FOR THAT RIGHT NOW BUT SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN- IN FIFTY TWO MY COLLEAGUES THERE. YEAH WELL AS ALL THE PANELISTS SO I LIKE TO TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME- IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM. WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE- ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO COME ON UP BUT IF YOU DO SO. SEEING AND HEARING NOW LET'S TURN TO THE PHONE LINES SO. ANYONE ON THE LINE. WISHING TO. SPEAK IN PUBLIC COMMENT. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN A COMMENT ON THE INITIATIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. USING A SPEAKER PHONE PLEASE PICK UP THE HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ON THE INITIATIVE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND ONE MOMENT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND NINE THIRTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS EMORY RUNG REPRESENTING PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE IN SAN DIEGO THE CONSUMER PRIVACY ADVOCATES BEING IN THE ISSUE SPACE FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES. IS THE STATE IN THE CITY ARE YOU A IS A MIXED BAG IN SOME WAYS GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS WILLING TO DO IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND IN TWENTY TWENTY. BY IMPROVING THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY ACT IN SOME KEY AREAS. IN SOME CASES ADOPTING VARIATIONS OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE MADE IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING THE REMOVAL OF THE STATUTORY RIGHT TO CURE OF THE CCPA AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PERSONAL INFORMATION DEFINITIONS. HOWEVER IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES RAISED BY OUR COLLEAGUES AT CONSUMER REPORTS AND COMMON SENSE MEDIA. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN OTHER AREAS THE C. D. R. E. A. REPRESENTS ONLY HALF STEPS THE REASON THE STEPS. THE DATA MINIMIZATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH PERMITTED BUSINESS TO COLLECT AND PROCESS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OT NECESSARY FOR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. AS LONG JUST USE FOR ANOTHER DISCLOSE PURPOSE AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CONTEXT WITH WHICH INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. WE THINK IT WOULD DO LITTLE TO PREVENT FOR EXAMPLE OF CONTACT TRACING APPLICATION FROM INCLUDING EXPLICATED LANGUAGE BURIED IN THAT THIS IS JUST CRIED SHE POLICY. SO LONG AS THE DISTANCE CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT IS BEEN TECHNICALLY DISCLOSED AND IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE INITIAL COLLECTION AND USE. IT ALSO REMAINS UNCLEAR WHAT IMPACT INITIATIVES AMENDMENTS SECTIONAL HAVE ON THE BILL WOULD BE TO IMPROVE AND REMEDY THE ISSUES WE SEE IN THE C. P. R. YEAH LIKE. OR THE IMPACT IT'LL HAPPEN TEACHER PRIVACY LEGISLATION. WE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO SEE THESE. BY YOUR PIECE OF WHAT. PERHAPS AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND TWENTY NINETEEN OR A. B. THIRTY ONE NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY. COULDN'T MOVE FORWARD REAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE SOLUTION PROPOSED IN THE C. P. R. EA. HOWEVER THIS TIME WILL BE NEITHER SUPPORTING OR OPPOSING. INITIATIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR FOR YOUR CALL- ANYONE ELSE SO. WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME. AT NINE TWENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN WE LIKE TO GO AHEAD WE LIKE TO ASK YOUR COMMENT TO BE BRIEF IF POSSIBLE. PLEASE GO AHEAD I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DON'T HAVE. THANK YOU. I DON'T OFTEN ON BEHALF OF INTERNET ASSOCIATION- I'D LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM CAL CHAMBER CANTIERE NFIB. AND CALIFORNIA RETAILERS EXPECTATION. ALSO LIKE TO REITERATE THAT I AND OUR MEMBER COMPANIES ARE COMMITTED POLICIES THAT PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS MEANINGFUL CONTROL OVER THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO ACCESS CORRECT DELETE AND DOWNLOAD DATA THEY PROVIDE THE COMPANIES. ARE CURRENTLY OUR MEMBERS ARE FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PPA AS WELL THE ON GOING REGULATORY PROCESS. BUT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. HELLO WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE- INITIATIVE WILL UP AND NOT PROCESS AND AT THE CHALLENGES TO MANY THE ACT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES GOING FORWARD. I A AND OUR MEMBERS LEAVE NOW AS WE GET THE TCPA THAT THE LEGISLATURE THE PROPER VENUE TO BAT SUCH A COMPLEX AND TECHNICAL AREA OF LAW AND POLICY IF PASSED. WE BELIEVE THIS INITIATIVE BUT EFFECTIVELY SIDELINED LEGISLATURE. NOT ONLY BAD IN THE POLICY RATES BY THE NATIONAL BUT ALSO IN ADAPTING WHAT OF THE NEW TECH. AND CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE FUTURE WE GREATLY THE BUILDING AWAY AND THAT'S- LICCARDO. WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON NOT DEPRIVE AND SECURITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL SIR OUT DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINE. YES MY NAME THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ADD THIS IS COURTNEY JUNK THENWAY ON BEHALF OF TAX THAT I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES ON THAT MEMBER COMPANIES PLACE A HIGH PRIORITY ON CONSUMER PRIVACY AND COMPANIES ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH COMPLIANCE WITH THE CPA GIVING REGULATIONS ARE NOT YET FINAL. NOW THE CPR A WOULD REQUIRE COMPANIES TO REDUCE THE FACT THAT THEY JUST CREATED BY WITH THE CCPA MOVING TARGET COMES AT A HUGE COST FOR CALIFORNIA COMPANIES INCLUDING SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES WE'RE TRYING TO RECOVER AND GROW JOBS DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE AMEND ABILITY SECTION AT THE PIER AND BELIEVE THAT ACTION HI THE HANDS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO REACT THE EVOLUTION AND TECHNOLOGY AND DEAL WITH URGENT ISSUES NOT BEAT YOUR THAT MAY HAVE SOME PRIVACY ELEMENT. LAWS NEED TO BE AMENABLE AND ADAPTABLE AND THROUGH THE AREA DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THIS I DO HAVE ALSO HEARD CPR A REPLACEMENT AG'S OFFICE AS THE REGULATOR AND CREATE THE NEW AGENCY WHICH WILL PUT ADDITIONAL BUDGET PRESSURE ON AN ALREADY STRAINED BUDGET. IF THE BALLOT MEASURE WERE TO PASS FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND MONEY WOULD BE TAKEN FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET FOR THIS NEW AGENCY AT A TIME WHEN THE LEGISLATURE IS MAKING HARD DECISIONS TO COME TO A BALANCED BUDGET THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME I TO FORT ST JOHN. I KNOW IT CAN'T BE OUR APPRECIATE IT CARE FOR HOLDING HEARING TODAY AND OUR- US TO SPEAK THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL ANYONE. ELSE ON THE LINE. THERE ARE NO FOR THE COMMON IN THE QUEUE.
