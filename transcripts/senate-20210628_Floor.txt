ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THIRTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO AN ACT RELATING TO TENANCY AND ACQUIRING THE URGENCY OF ARAB STATES TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY MA'AM SECRETARY IF YOU READ THAT AGAIN PLEASE. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT THIRTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TO AN ACT RELATING TO TENANCY IN DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE UP TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY CENTRE COVER HERE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT A B. THREE EIGHTY TWO EIGHT THIRTY TWO. THE NEXT STEP IN ENSURING VULNERABLE CALIFORNIA RENTERS ARE PROTECTED AND LANDLORDS ARE MADE WHOLE. I'D LIKE TO THINK LEADERSHIP IN BOTH HOUSES AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE WORK AND SUPPORT ON THIS REALLY CRITICAL ISSUE. EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS VERY WELL THE STRUGGLES FAMILIES IN OUR DISTRICTS FACE SHORTLY AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH OF LAST YEAR. WHEN THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS ONE OF MY FIRST CONCERN. WAS HOW PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY FOR LAID OFF OR WERE PUT OUT OF WORK. WOULD PAY THEIR RENT. PUT FOOD ON THEIR TABLES OR KEEP THEIR POWER AND WATER ON. DESPITE THE MANY CHALLENGES MANY RESIDENTS WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SOME OF THEIR INCOME SUPPLEMENTED BY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BUT UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA'S LONGSTANDING HOUSING CRISIS. AND EXTREME RENT PRICES MEANT MANY WERE LEFT UNABLE TO PAY THE RENT. IN RESPONSE THE STATE STEPPED IN AND PASSED THE FIRST EVICTION MORATORIUM AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. FOLLOWED BY S. B. NINETY ONE WHICH EXTENDED THE MORATORIUM AND PROVIDED THE FIRST RUN ROUND OF FUNDING. TO RENTERS MOST IN NEED. NOW WITH THE VACCINES PROVIDING IMMUNITY WE FINALLY SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. MANY SIGNIFICANT COVERT SAFETY PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN LIFTED MORE PEOPLE ARE BACK TO WORK AND THE ECONOMY IS SLOWLY RECOVERING. DESPITE THE GOOD NEWS THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE. A. B. EIGHT THIRTY TO TAKE THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP TO KEEP TENANTS FROM BECOMING HOMELESS. AND HELP LANDLORDS RECOVER DESPERATELY NEEDED RENTAL INCOME. SPECIFICALLY AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO WILL EXPAND OVER FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF FEDERAL RENT ASSISTANCE. TO EXTEND THE STATEWIDE ELECTION MORATORIUM THROUGH SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. INCREASE BRETT REIMBURSEMENT 21100% FOR BOTH RENT IN ARREARS AND PROSPECTIVE PAYMENTS. IT'S A PATHWAY FOR TENANTS TO RECEIVE DIRECT RENT PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT ALANLAR DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE REVAMPED AND READ ROBUST CASH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGH AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO THE BILL ALSO CREATES A NEW COURT PROCESS TO ENSURE TENANTS ARE PROTECTED AFTER THE EVICTION MORATORIUM IS LIFTED AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THE MARK MORATORIUM ENDS. SHOULD ALIGN OR PURSUE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO NOW REQUIRES THAT LANDLORDS PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO THE COURT. THAT THEY ATTEMPTED TO SECURE RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE NON PAYMENT OF RENT LET'S DO THIS WILL ENSURE THAT TENANTS ARE NOT EVICTED BECAUSE THE LANDLORD FOR. FAILED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND IT KEEPS EVERYBODY HONEST IN THE PROCESS. FOURTEEN MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE GOVERNOR DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. AND MANY HAVE SUFFERED TERRIBLE LOSS OF FAMILY AND LOVED ONES BECAUSE OF THIS VIRUS. MANY MORE WERE PUT OUT OF WORK THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN IN PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHO DISPROPORTIONATELY WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY. AND FELT THE HARSHEST IMPACT OF THE CORONA VIRUS DESPITE THE NECESSARY HARDSHIP THE STATE. SHUT DOWN BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS COME BACK JUST AS STRONG IF NOT STRONGER THAN BEFORE. OUR UNEMPLOYMENT IS NOW THE LOWEST IT'S BEEN SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN IS GETTING CLOSER TO PRE FUND DIFERENT LEVELS EVERY MONTH AND OUR STATE REVENUES ARE HIGHER THAN ANYONE COULD EVER PROJECTED. I'M CONFIDENT THAT AB EIGHT THIRTY TWO IS A MEASURED APPROACH THAT PROTECTS VULNERABLE TENANTS. HELPS LANDLORDS RECOVERED FROM TREMENDOUS LOSSES AND WILL SERVE AS A SAFETY NET NECESSARY. TO MOVE IT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS HISTORIC PANDEMIC. THANK YOU AND I RESPECT FOR YOUR I. BOATS HERE I BOUGHT TODAY THANK YOU CENTER CABALLERO SENATOR BATES FOR WHAT PURPOSE YOU RISE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I DO HAVE FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS AT THE DESK. VERY GOOD MOMENTUM SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE READ THE AMENDMENTS. AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR BATES SAT ONE. THANK YOU OUR MEMBERS THE AMENDMENTS ARE QUITE SIMPLE HOURS MAY I READ NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW A TENANT SHALL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR RENTAL RELIEF UNDER THIS CHAPTER IF THE TENANT DID NOT FILE A CLAIM FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BETWEEN MARCH FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY AND JUNE FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER LAW A TENANT WHO DID NOT FILE A CLAIM FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BETWEEN MARCH FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY AND JUNE FIFTEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHALL MAKE PAYMENT IN FULL OF ALL PAST DUE RENT TO THEIR LANDLORD WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS FACT. MEMBERS RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED BY KOBE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS MUST STILL PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES THEIR OPERATIONAL COSTS AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES FROM RENTAL INCOME AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW MANY OF OUR SENIORS THAT IS HOW THEY ARE SURVIVING THE EVICTION MORATORIUM AND ITS EXTENSION HAVE NOT WORKED THE MONEY HAS NOT GONE OUT. RATHER IT HAS CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONGOING ABUSES FROM RANCHERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FINANCIALLY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC THERE ARE RENTERS WHO CAN'T PAY THE RENT BUT I'VE USED THE STATE'S POLICIES TO AVOID PAYING RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE PATIENTLY WAITED UNTILJUNE THIRTIETH TO RECEIVE THOSE RENT PAYMENTS THERE'S NO REASON THEY SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT ANY LONGER. THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD LIMIT THIS NEXT EXTENSION ONLY TO THOSE RENTERS WHO HAVE FILED UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS DURING COLD DEAD FROM THE DATE OF THE GOVERNOR'S EMERGENCY TO JUNE FIFTEENTH WHEN CALIFORNIA RE OPENED THOSE WHO HAVE NOT FILED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THEIR PAST DUE RENT WITHIN THOSE THIRTY DAYS THE AMENDMENTS ALLOW FOR THOSE RENTERS WHO HAVE BEEN FINANCIALLY IMPACTED TO GET THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED. EVERYONE ELSE NEEDS TO PAY THE RANSOM. RENTAL PROPERTY- OWNERS HAVE MORE IN TH WEIGHT OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S ACTIONS. QUITE LONG ENOUGH I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES SAID HER TO WORK FOR A PURPOSE YOU RISE THANK YOU TO MAKE MOTIONS RELATING THEM IT'S ON THE TABLE MADAM. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG IS ASKING TOO LATE THE MOST- THE AMENDMENTS ON THE TABLE. MADAM SECRETARY IS ASKING FOR AN IPHONE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN HI ARCHULETA.

FIVE THIRTY ONE KNOWS NINE THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN LAID ON THE TABLE MEMBERS WE WILL NOW RETURN TO THE BILL IN CHIEF IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE ON THE BILL CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SORRY NEEDS TO SIT IN THIS CHAIR FOR COMMITTEE. AND NOTHING AND FLOWER BEDS A QUESTION THE AUTHOR IF POSSIBLE. IN A CAREER WE TAKE A QUESTION ABSOLUTELY PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR- R. ET DE PAYMENTS- CALCULATED INTO THE FORMULA IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS NO. THANK YOU- IF THE LANDLORDS PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM- DO THE LANDLORDS GET THE DIRECT PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE OR THE AGENCY PAYING THIS BILL ON BEHALF OF THE- PERSON IT'S RENTING THE PROPERTY OR DOES IT GO TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEN TO THE LANDLORD. SO UNDER THIS BILL- THE LANDLORD WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE PAYMENTS IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PRIOR BILL- AND SO THAT PRACTICE WILL CONTINUE HOWEVER IF THE LANDLORD DECLINES AND RENT IS FOLLOWED. NINE A BIG LANDLORD DECLINES TO PARTICIPATE AND THEY'RE STILL MONEY THAT'S OWED BY THE TENANT THE TENANT CAN RECEIVE THE MONEY. AND THEN I HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS I APOLOGIZE IF THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO THE LANDLORD IS IT A PERCENTAGE OF THE RENT DO YOU OR IS IT 1100% COVERAGE OF THE RENT. IT IS I GUESS THE FINAL QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- THERE'S- DOLLARS IN THIS PACKAGE FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. TO GO BACK AND PAY. PAST DEBTS. THAT THE LANDLORD IS OWED- PRIOR TO THEM BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM SO. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IF A LANDLORD IN ROLES TODAY. WHEN THIS BILL PASSES AND THEY HAVE A TENANT WHO HASN'T PAID BILLS FOR SIX MONTHS. WITH THIS AMERICAN RESCUE FUNDS ALLOW THE LANDLORD TO GO BACK AND PARTICIPATE IN THAT WINTER RECOVERY. YES IT DOES THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU CENTER GROUP CENTER TORONTO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE BILL I URGE SUPPORT TODAY ALMOST 80% OF MY CONSTITUENTS ARE RENTERS MORE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE MANY OF THE FAMILIES WERE ALREADY LIVING ON THE EDGE OF ECONOMIC EVICTION BEFORE THE INSTABILITY OF THIS PAST YEAR. TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE OVERWHELMING NEED FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE IN LOS ANGELES DURING THE OPEN APPLICATION PERIOD FOR RENT ASSISTANCE. MORE THAN SIXTY SIX THOUSAND TENANTS SUBMITTED APPLICATIONS ALONG WITH MORE THAN FORTY THREE THOUSAND LANDLORDS IT'S ADDED UP TO FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN RENTAL ARREARS THE EXTENSION OF THE VACATION MORATORIUM WILL KEEP FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES WHILE THEY ACCESS NEEDED ASSISTANCE WILL HELP MAKE SURE OUR COMMUNITIES ARE STABLE AS WE CONTINUE TO RECOVER AND HEAL FROM THIS DEVASTATING CRISIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS- SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR OF THE V. THIRTY TWO- ALSO REPRESENT- COMMUNITY THAT- WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF RENTERS HI I AM A VERY EXPENSIVE COMMUNITY WHO ARE HANGING ON BY THEIR FINGERNAILS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND ARE TRULY HANG ON BY THEIR FINGERNAILS- TODAY- WE NEED TO MAKE SURE FIRST AND FOREMOST- AS WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. THAT WE KEEP PEOPLE STABLE IN THEIR HOMES I THINK THAT THERE IS A TENDENCY NOW BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL EXUBERANCE- ABOUT THE VACCINE ABOUT THE REOPENING- ABOUT ALL THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING IN COMING UT OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE CURVE IN NINETEEN TEN THE NEXT HAS LEFT DEEP ECONOMIC SCARS ON THE STATE THOSE CARS HAVE NOT HEALED SO MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT BACK AT WORK SO MANY PEOPLE AS WE KNOW TRAGICALLY STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. A LIVING OF THEIR CREDIT CARDS. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST A HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD WHO PASSED AWAY. TO THE COVE IT OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS THIS PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT SUCH DEEP LASTING STRESS. THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF THE STATE IT IS GOING TO TAKE US TIME TO RECOVER. AND THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED. TO COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC. IS TO HAVE WAVES OF AFFECTIONS AND WAVES OF EVEN MORE HOMELESSNESS. AND WE HAVE ALREADY DONE WILL. EMPTY OUR ABILITY. TO RECOVER. I WANT TO BE FREE THIS STILL NOT. THIS WAS OVER OF GIVEN TO- THERE ARE GOOD THINGS THIS BILL THE EXTENT OF THE MORE. THE INCREASE TO A 100% THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOW ALLOWING TENANTS TO APPLY DIRECTLY AND THEY DON'T JUST HAVE TO. RELY ON THEIR LANDLORD TO APPLY THE FACT THAT WE NOW HAVE STRONGER INCENTIVES FOR LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT GET AN INFECTION IF THEY DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN GETTING A 100% OF THE RENT. PAID THAT IS ALL GOOD WE WILL ALLOW MORE TENANTS- TO AVOID RENT THAT MORE LANDLORDS WILL GET PAID ALL OF THEIR BACKGROUND. I'M NOT A FAN OF SOME PIECES OF THIS LIKE THE- THE LONG PREEMPTION- BYE YOU KNOW THIS WAS A RESULT OF NEGOTIATION AND GIVE AND TAKE. AND I THINK IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT WHAT I DO JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING WE HAVE TO. HOLD THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING THIS A MUCH EASIER PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY APPLY FOR THE MONEY IT SHOULDN'T TAKE A THIRTY TWO PAGE APPLICATION. RESIDENTS TAKE HAVING TO CALL ON THE PHONE LINES WERE YOU CAN'T GET ANYONE ON THE PHONE WE MUST MOVE THIS MONEY OUT TO THE PEOPLE BOTH LANDLORDS AND TENANTS WHO NEED IT- WE HAVE TO DO BETTER IN THAT REGARD. BUT THIS IS A CRITICAL STEP WEDNESDAY IS RIGHT UPON US AND I ASKED. FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTRE BRADFORD. THANK YOU MA'AM FOR I TOO STAND SUPPORT A AV. EIGHT THIRTY TWO AND I TO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT AND CONCERNS ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION. I'M PLEASED THAT THIS BILL WILL PREVENT MORE CALIFORNIA FROM BECOMING HOMELESS BUT CURRENTLY THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. CALIFORNIANS YOU'RE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE BEING AFRICAN AMERICAN. FOR EXAMPLE AFTER AMERICAN PEOPLE MAKE UP OF THE HOMELESSNESS WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE NUMBERS IN THOSE- PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING IMPACTED. I APPRECIATE THE DIVISIONAL TIME IN THIS EXTENSION FOR MANY WHO NEED THIS RENTAL ASSISTANCE. WHO HAVE YET TO RECEIVE IT HOWEVER SOME TENETS OF SMALL LANDLORDS. HAVE STATED AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY ENROLLING IN THIS PROGRAM JUST THIS WEEKEND WHEN I WAS DOING A TOUR OF THE SOAP BY STADIUM IN INGLEWOOD I WAS APPROACHED BY. THREE LANDLORDS WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT HALL CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT THIS WAS IN THE FACT THAT THEY HIT ONE HIT FIVE TENDED TO MADE NO EFFORT. TO PAY RENT IN THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS DESPITE ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE FORM IN THE YET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT SO IT IS A CUMBERSOME PROCESS. AND LANDLORDS ARE FRUSTRATED JUST AS WELL AS TENANTS ARE FEARFUL OF BEING DISPLACED. I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED PROGRESS ON MAKING. ASSISTANCE EASIER TO ACCESS AND I HOPE WE CAN AND MORE CAN BE DONE TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AS WE GO FORWARD. THE REDUCED IMPACT ON PEOPLE- I ALSO HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT THIS RULE SINCE ITS PROGRAM MIGHT NOT BE REACHING ALL THE CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE AT THE COMMUNITIES ARE STATED- NOW REACH BY THE STATE HAS NOT ACHIEVED A MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS. TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES- TODAY'S BUDGET ACTION WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO ETHNIC MEDIA VIA THE STATE LIBRARY BUT I DON'T THINK. THAT'S THE REAL ANSWER. IT'S A GOOD MEASURE AND IT COULD COMPLEMENT OUR EFFORTS BUT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST NOT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR RADFORD SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. SENECA WHERE WE TAKE A QUESTION OR TWO YES THEY WERE PLEASE PROCEED- THANK YOU SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND CLEARLY THAT IN ORDER FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO TAKE PLACE THE TENANT AND THE LANDLORD MUST BOTH APPLY FOR THE PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND SET THE TENANT CHOOSES NOT TO. APPLY THEN THE LANDLORD DOES NOT GET ANY TYPE OF REIMBURSEMENTS ARE CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT. OKAY- SO THE SECOND QUESTION IS- OVER THE LAST YEAR IT'S I THINK THE ESTIMATE WAS SIX UNDER NINETEEN MILLION WAS REQUESTED- IN REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS AND OF THAT SIX HUNDRED NINETEEN MILLION THE STATE HAS PAID OUT. 80% OF THOSE FUNDS SO WHAT IS IN THIS BILL TO INSURE THAT. ALL OF THE MONEY IS PAID OUT IN THIS I MEAN 8% IS. EMBARRASSING 8% OVER THE LAST YEAR HAS BEEN PAID OUT SO. HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS- EXTENSION OF THE MORATORIUM AN ADDITIONAL FUNDS THINKING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE 8% REPRESENTS OR THE PERCENTAGE- AND I DON'T I CREEK QUITE FRANKLY TO REMEMBER C. 8% REPRESENTS THIS THE PART THAT THE STATE IS ADMINISTERING APART FROM THE STATE ADMINISTRATION. THE BIG CITIES AND THE BIGGER COUNTIES WERE GIVEN A DIRECT ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT DATA WE DON'T IS NOT INCLUDED IN THAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU QUOTED AND SO- THEY ARE DOING THEIR OWN PROGRAMS. I'M A COUPLE OF THE COUNTIES HAVE AND MAYBE MORE THAN A COUPLE HAVE ELECTED TO PAY UP TO A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF THE PAST DUE RENT AND- AND SO THERE'S ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BUT AS AS FAR AS THE STATE PROCESS HAS GONE- THE NUMBERS ARE ARE ARE FAIRLY FAIRLY SMALL AND SO WE'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE'VE ASKED THAT THEY EXPEDITE THEIR THEIR APPLICATION PROCESS THAT IT BECOME MUCH SIMPLER. AND THAT THEY ENGAGE THE LANDLORD COMMUNITY SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE LANDLORDS ARE PARTICIPATING AS WELL BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S PART OF BEING PART OF THE ISSUE. WITH WITH THE ALLOCATION OF- ALLOCATING THE FUNDS SO WE'VE GOT A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THAT- THE PROCESS IS GOING TO MOVE FASTER AND THAT PART THAT WE CAN CONTROL WILL BE- THE PART THAT WE SEE THE DATA ON. THANK YOU SENATOR CABALLERO. THE CENTER MALL IS THANK YOU SO MUCH JUST A FOLLOW UP SO IT'S- ALMOST JULY AND THIS IS GOING TO EXTEND IT AND THROUGH END OF SEPTEMBER. RIGHT THE MORATORIUM MAKES IS EXTENDED TO SEPTEMBER NOT THE ALLOCATION OF THE RESOURCES WE HAVE THE ALLOCATION OF THE RESOURCES FOR MORE THAN THAT RIGHT SO. IF WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT UP SOME CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE TO THE PROCESS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR ALL PARTIES INVOLVED TO APPLY AND GET THEIR FUNDS REIMBURSED. THAT'S A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME FOR- YOU KNOW THESE DEPARTMENTS TO RE WORK THESE FORMS TO GET IPUT FROM. LANDLORDS AND TENANTS AND THEN. GET THAT RE WORKED APPLICATION OUT TO THOSE WHO I MEAN IS THAT REALISTIC. SO IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CRITICISM OF THE PROCESS HAS BEEN- HAS BEEN EXPRESSED FOR SOME TIME BEEN VERY CLEAR THAT THE MONEY IS WASN'T GETTING OUT THE DOOR FAST ENOUGH AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY WORKED ON THE ON THE REDESIGN OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND THAT IT IT IS DONE IF IT'S NOT CLOSE TO BEING DONE SO IT'S MY EXPECTATION. THAT ONCE THIS BILL IS PASSED WHICH IS WHY WE'RE ACTIVELY MOVING THIS QUICKLY- RATHER THAN WAITING% UNTIL AUGUST IS BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO GET THE MONEY OUT WANT TO GET PEOPLE- IT'D MAKE AT NU OP ART TO MAKE AN APPLICATION AND TO- MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING RESOURCES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA'S SENATOR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MINUTE PRESENT I WANT TO. ADD A COUPLE OF POINTS GIVEN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WAS RAISED FIRST OF ALL. THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY HAS CHANGED THE GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO HOW THIS PROGRAM OPERATED BEFORE. AND HOW IT OPERATES NOW. THERE'S AN ABILITY TO SELF CERTIFY WHICH HAS MADE IT A LOT EASIER FOR THE MECHANICS OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE SECOND. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT UNDER THE PREVIOUS RULES THE LANDLORD HAD TO ACCEPT EIGHTY PERCENT. THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF LAW IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A CONTRACT YOU CAN'T IMPAIR THE CONTRACT AND ASK THE LANDLORD TO ACCEPT LESS THAN. A HUNDRED CENTS ON THE DOLLAR UNLESS YOU INCENTIVIZE AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TAX INCENTIVES AND ALL SORTS OF PROGRAMS TO INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN LEVELS OF BEHAVIOR. BUT WHEN YOU PAY A OF THIS MEASURE THE ENTIRE MECHANISM OF THE PROCESS CHANGES. BECAUSE IF I GO TO- SAY THE PRO TEM AND I SAY LISTENABLE SHORT OF MONEY CAN YOU LEND ME. MY SCRATCH FOR RENT THIS MONTH SHE WANTED TO MEET THE LANDLORD DOESN'T KNOW THAT THE PRO TEM LET ME THE-MONEY THE LANDLORD WAS PAY DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GET THE MONEY FROM. CHANGE THE RULES DRAMATICALLY AND ALLOWS THE PROGRAM TO BE STREAMLINED WHICH- HAS THE AUTHOR HAS INDICATED IS ALREADY HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS IN IN THAT REGARD SO. WITH THE TENANTS RIGHT TO APPLYING. WITH THE 100% WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD. WITH THE DIFFERENT GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY IN THE UNITED STATES UNDERSECRETARY ELLEN. IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAVE IS A LEGISLATURE. IN MOVING FORWARD AND THOSE MEASURES HAVE BEEN INFORMED IN WHAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR A NOVEL. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS OF COURSE THE AUTHOR. SENATE CAREER WOULD TAKE A QUESTION SURE PLEASE DON'T FEED. F. AS WITH A STATEMENT FIRST OF ALL WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE. NOT HAD THE ABILITY TO PAY THE RENT OR THE PERSON THAT IS RENTING NEEDS TO BE MADE WHOLE. AND WITH THAT BEING SAID WE'VE HEARD ON THE FLOOR TODAY ABOUT STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A QUICK MANNER SO WITH THAT BEING SAID ARE THERE ANY SAFEGUARDS IN THIS BILL THAT WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING FRAUD WE SAW. WITH THE D. D. THAT WE TOOK THE EMPLOYER OUT OF THE EQUATION WE SAW LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRAUD SO WHEN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE. IS THERE FRAUD PROTECTION IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION- YES AND THAT THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON THAT. THE APPLICATION PROCESS WAS FAIRLY EXTENSIVE BECAUSE THE- THE- GOAL WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WORD WERE PROTECTED NETWORK WERE NOT SUBJECT TO FRAUD AND THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING CHECKS THAT SHOULDN'T GET THE CHECKS- BUT BUT- AS- THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES SAID WE'VE COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO BE ABLE TO SELF CERTIFY AND TO BE ABLE TO- MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY IS GOING TO PAY THE LANDLORD. AT TO PAY DOWN RENT AND SO- YES THERE THERE ARE THERE ARE PROCESSES IN IN THAT IN THERE ARE PROCESSES AND WE'RE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS. SO WE'RE ABLE TO TRACK THEN- AT A LATER DATE WILL BE ABLE TO TRACK TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS THE ABILITY THAT THEY- THEY WENT TO THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD GO TO. ANOTHER PEOPLE SHOULD GO TO YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HOLLINGS CENTER MORICHES. QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR IF I MAY SET A CAREER WE TAKE A QUESTION I YES I WILL AND THEN FROM THIS POINT ON I'LL DO IT IN MY CLOTHES ARE VERY GOOD CENTER MORICHES THANK YOU- CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT SELF CERTIFICATION BECAUSE I KNOW WE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE- THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS AND IN TWENTY TWENTY. WE WERE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF VERIFICATION THAT THE INDIVIDUAL DID IN FACT LOSE THEIR JOB- AND WAS NOT IN A FINANCIAL CAPACITY TO PAY THE RENT YOU TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SELF CERTIFICATION. YOUR SELF AT THE STATION. GOOD QUESTION. I DON'T HAVE THE MECHANISM IN FRONT OF ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH- WE TALKED ABOUT IT AS PART OF THE BILL WHICH WAS TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT WHICH WOULD GET US AWAY FROM THE THIRTY TWO PAGE DOCUMENT THAT THAT WAS REQUIRED- BUT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I JUST DON'T REMEMBER RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD TELL YOU THE TRUTH. WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE MANNER PRESIDENT TO ASK ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE IN THE ROOM IF. THERE COULD BE AN EXPLANATION ON THAT. IF I HAVE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES AND MAY BE ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. OKAY ONE MOMENT CENTER BARGES. CENTERS FOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION SURE WE HAVE IT YOU PLEASE PROCEED JUST YOU KNOW JUST LIKE AS YOU KNOW AS A MEMBER OF THE BAR THAT YOU SIMPLY SIGN A DECLARATION OF THE PENALTY OF PERJURY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME IN PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COURT. WHERE WE SIGNED A DECLARATION WE OUTLINED THE FAX THE DECLARATIONS EVERY SO WHEN YOU SIMPLY FILE AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTION IT'S A JUDICIAL COUNCIL FORM WITH A BUNCH OF BOXES THE END YOU SIGN ON TO A PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT SUFFICIENT AND THERE'S CONSEQUENCES FOR LYING ON THE ON A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT AND THAT'S SO THAT IS CERTAINLY HOW IT'S HOW IT'S BEEN DONE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND HOW IT'S DONE EVERY SINGLE UNLAWFUL DETAINER PROCEEDINGS IN TERMS OF WHAT EVIDENCE BEFORE COURT. AND THAT'S HOW IT GETS DONE THIS CONSEQUENCES FOR NOT TELLING THE TRUTH BUT THERE'S A REAL PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WE USE TO EVERY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING AND WOULD SIMPLY BE APPLIED HERE AND. CERTAINLY WITH PINTS OF CERTIFICATIONS REGARD. THINKCENTRE YOUR- CENTER PORCHES I THINK THAT'S FINE. THANK YOU YES. SENATOR ATKINS MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR- FOR TAKING THE TIME TO WALK THROUGH SO MUCH OF THESE DETAILS WE ARE FOLLOWING FEDERAL GUIDELINES WHICH REQUIRE SELF ATTESTATION OR SELF CERTIFICATION AND IN ADDITION AS THE AUTHOR HAVE SAID WE ARE WORKING BETWEEN AND EXTENSIVELY LONG DOCUMENT THAT PRECLUDED SOME PEOPLE FROM FEELING LIKE THEY COULD ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THERE IS A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN MAKING SURE THAT THE FORM IS SUCH THAT PEOPLE USE IT- THAT THE LANDLORDS ARE GONE AND THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS. AND AT THE SAME TIME TRY TO MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE TO AVOID ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO HELP. RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND MEET ALL OF-THESE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS SO WHEN WE SAID ONCE BEFORE THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE WORK TO DO WE KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE CONTINUED WORK TO DO TO GET DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED THE RESOURCES. SO THAT THEY CAN KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS SO THAT LANDLORDS COULD BE PAID. SMALL LANDLORDS- AND SO I THINK. I UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF THE QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS BECAUSE CLEARLY WE WANT THESE DOLLARS- THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE USED IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDS. AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO WORK HERE BECAUSE SHOULD THIS PROGRAM STILL BE CUMBERSOME OR WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THE DOLLARS OUT IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE'VE COMMITTED AS PART OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND A AND THE- ASSEMBLY. THAT WE MAY HAVE MORE WORK TO DO IN FACT THE MAJORITY LEADER HAS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THE WAY- BUT IN THAT. EXPEDIENCY TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T MISS A DEADLINE- THAT IS UPON US AND THAT PEOPLE DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE NO RESOURCES AND THEN THINK THERE'S NO PROGRAMMING OR FURTHER CONFUSED. I APPLAUD THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE AND I HOPE THAT THAT IS HELPFUL TO SOME DEGREE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. THANK YOU SENATOR ATKINS. MEMBERS IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SARAH PALMER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS ARE MUCH APPRECIATED- THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS BILL GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY. THEY HAVE THE TIME WE NEED TO RECOVER- THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO HELP TENANTS WE DO NOT WANT THEM TO END UP HOMELESS AND ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T THEY COULDN'T PAY A DEBT. THAT WAS DUE AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HELPING LANDLORDS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN PATIENT MANY OF THEM HAVE MISSED THEIR OWN PAYMENTS FOR THEIR TAXES. AND THEY DESPERATELY NEED RESOURCES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE HOUSING THAT IS MUCH NEEDED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AS I INDICATED THE ADMINISTRATION IS HAS THE COMMITMENT TO GET THESE FUNDS OUT QUICKLY AND TO DO IT IN A- IN A- RESPONSIBLE MANNER AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL DO THAT BUT WE WILL HAVE TO. WATCH AND MAKE SURE THA THIS ALL WORKS OUT WELL- AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR CAFIERO MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

PRETTY HARD NOSE ON THESE MO USE OVER THE MANY YEARS. BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ON THIS PARTICULAR ONE. I HAVE HAD MY OWN EXPERIENCES DEALING WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AND I'LL CALL. CCPO I CALLED IT THE TOUGHEST BEAT. WELL I'M ALMOST IN AGREEMENT THAT IT IS THE TOUGH BEAT. THESE EMPLOYEES THEIR DAILY LIVES ARE NOT EVER WITHIN A PLEASANT ATMOSPHERE. OR DEALING WITH NECESSARILY PLEASANT ISSUES. AND THE PRESSURES UPON THEM ARE ENORMOUS SOMETIMES IT EBBS AND FLOWS. BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS CERTAINLY BETTER TO HAVE. AND THEY DON'T HAVE MUCH SECURITY ANYMORE HAS THIS GOVERNORS DECIDED TO CLOSE MORE PRISONS. NOW HIS GOAL THERE IS WHAT HE CALLS A REALIGNMENT I GATHER AND HE IS SOMEONE WHO SHOULD NOT BE INCARCERATING EVERYBODY WILL WANT AT THIS END GAMES HERE. IS TO ENSURE THAT IN THE FUTURE IF THE LEGISLATURE DESIRES OF THE PEOPLE DEMAND AN INCREASE IN SENTENCING IN ANY WAY. THERE WON'T BE ANY ROOM AT THE END NOW THAT'S A LITTLE SUBTLE GOAL OF SOME OF THE PROPONENTS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM BUT LET'S GET BACK TO THE ISSUE AT HAND. THE JOB OF THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK WITHIN THE INSTITUTIONS. IT IS A RISKY BUSINESS. IT IS A DEPRESSING BUSINESS. I HAD TO WONDER MYSELF HOW I WAS ABLE TO GO HOME NIGHT AFTER NIGHT. A LOT OF BAD DREAMS ABOUT WHAT I EXPERIENCED DURING THE DAY AHEAD. IT IS TOUGH IT'S TOUGH FOR THE INMATES WITHIN THE INSTITUTION. BUT MOST ASSUREDLY THOSE WHO ARE THERE FOR STUDENTS. AND THOSE WHO DO THE HELP FOR THOSE INMATES PROVIDING THEM REHABILITATIVE OPPORTUNITIES. THIS IS A TOUGH LEAGUE AND THESE INDIVIDUALS DESERVE THE SAME- YOU HIRED A NOVEL. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SENATOR AMBER- THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- THAT IS CORRECT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WORK IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT. A DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY'RE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER AND CLOCKS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THOSE THAT THEY GUARD MAINTAIN- AND AS A CONSEQUENCE. THEY HAVE DANGERS THAT THAT WE DON'T FACE FOR EXAMPLE DANGERS WITH RESPECT TO COVE IN NINETEEN. ARE THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM THOSE WHO DECLINED TO BE VACCINATED WE CAN DO SO THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY DISASSOCIATE THEMSELVES FROM THOSE OF THE REQUIRED TO GUARD. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN TWENTY EIGHT CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS WHO HAVE DIED FROM CARBON NINETEEN AND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN INMATES HAVE DIED FROM COVERT NINETEEN- HOWEVER. SADLY ONLY FIFTY ONE POINT 5% OF THOSE WHO ARE CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS HAVE BEEN VACCINATED. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. YOU KNOW THIS WATER IS NOW GONE BEYOND THE BRIDGE. BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ENCOUNTER THIS KIND OF CRISIS THAT THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE OR IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE- POST. ADOPTION MO YOU TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE PRISON- CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO DO SO THAT THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO CREATE THOSE INCENTIVES TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH THEY AND THOSE THAT THEY GUARD REMAIN SAFE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THE CENTER I'M BERG. THIRD ALI. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT. AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR FOR SIXTEEN YEARS I REPRESENTED- CCC AND HIGH DESERT AND LASSEN COUNTY. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE OVER THESE CONTRACTS AND- AND- AND HOW MUCH THEY GET PAID IN THEIR COMPENSATION AND I WILL JUST SHARE WITH YOU. I KNOW MANY OF THESE. MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK THERE THEY'RE ESSENTIAL WORKERS- AND THEN COMING TO THE SENATE ACTUALLY INHERITED THE FOLSOM. PRISON AS WELL AND I WOULD JUST WANT TO SEE- IF YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T TOURED A PRISON AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE PLATE PLACES WHERE THEY HAVE TO WORK YOU SHOULD. THE RATE OF. SPOUSAL ABUSE THE RATE FOR CHILDREN SO. THAT THEY COME THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING ENVIRONMENT COMES HOME WITH THEM. THEY NEED TO BE THEY NEED TO HAVE THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM.

AN AGREEMENT THAT MAINTAINS MOST OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF BOTH THE LEGISLATORS AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. IN THE WAKE OF A FIFTEEN MONTH PANDEMIC THAT pSUFFERING ON SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS BUSINESSES. MORE THIS IS WHAT THIS BUDGET. CALIFORNIA IS BUILDING BACK BOLDLY THIS IS A GOOD NEWS BUDGET. IT REPRESENTS TOTAL GENERAL FUND SPENDING A HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FOUR BILLION ANY FUNDS OUR SCHOOLS AT THE HIGHEST PROP NINETY EIGHT LEVEL EVER NINETY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION REPRESENTING TWENTY ONE THOUSAND PER STUDENT. AS IT MAKES CALIFORNIA THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS. WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE SLOTS. OVER TIME EXPANDED PRESCHOOL T. K. AND AFTER SCHOOL THIS BUDGET SUPPORTS OUR CHILDREN AGE ZERO TO FIVE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT WILL HELP CALIFORNIA WOMEN GET BACK TO WORK. AND IN A YEAR WHERE THE NECESSITY OF HELP CLEAR HEALTHCARE WAS CLEARER THAN EVER. WE HAVE EXPANDED HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND SUPPORT FOR OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARE PROVIDING ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AGE FIFTY AND ABOVE WITH MEDI CAL COVERAGE AND WE HAVE ENDED THE ASSET TEST BED EXPANDED PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL SERVICES UNDER MEDICARE. PIRATE WITH THE PREPARATION IN THIS BUDGET MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO ATTEND ARE YOU SEE AND CSU'S SYSTEMS ANY INCREASES IN FINANCIAL AID OUR CALGARY ANTS IN OUR MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP. SETS US ON A PATH TO DEBT FREE COLLEGE AND FOR THE FIRST TIME PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO CALIFORNIA TO START COMMUNITY COLLEGE LATER IN LIFE. WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO DEVELOP NEW JOB SKILLS SO IMPORTANT IN THIS POST PANDEMIC AIR. THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS TO WHICH IS CONTAINED IN THIS BUDGET PUTS ADDITIONAL MONEY DIRECTLY INTO THE POCKETS OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND FAMILIES WITH DEPENDENTS. AND THERE IS ADDITIONAL GRANT FUNDING FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES OR NONPROFITS AND OUR ARTS MUSIC AND CULTURAL VENUES ALL WERE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND WITH TWELVE BILLION INVESTMENT OVER TWO YEARS INCLUDING ONE BILLION A FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO OUR LARGEST CITIES ONE BILLION PER YEAR FOR TWO YEARS WE'RE MAKING A VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TOWARDS ENDING HOMELESSNESS. OUR FOOD BANKS DIAPER BANKS BAND FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE INCLUDING MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS IN THOSE BANKS GET A BOOST AND WE SET A PATH TOWARD ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS BEING ABLE TO ACCESS FOOD ASSISTANCE SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO COME COME BACK. FOOD INSECURITY AND HUNGER WHICH IS SO RAMPANT UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR STATE. OUR ACCESS TO JUSTICE INVESTMENT SUPPORT ADDITIONAL LEGAL AID ELIMINATE MANY COURT FEES AND ALLOW FAMILIES TO SPEAK WITH THEIR INCARCERATED RELATIVES FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME FREE OF CHARGE. MANY OF US HAVE BEEN FIGHTING SINCE THE RECESSIONTO PULL UP THE SUPPORT FOR SSI AND S. S. P. RECIPIENTS AND TO THOSE WHO PROVIDE CARE FOR OUR DISABLED FOLKS. AND ALSO THE SUPPORT TO OUR LOWEST INCOME FAMILIES WHO RECEIVE CALL WORKS. WITH THIS BUDGET ALL RECEIVE RATE INCREASES. THE BUDGET ALSO MAKES MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN WILDFIRE DROUGHT CLIMATE RESILIENCY ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FINDS DETAILS WHICH WILL COME BEFORE US LATER BUT THE DOLLARS ARE HERE.

WE ALL BEGAN TO LIVE ENTIRELY THROUGH THE INTERNET IN THIS LAST PERIOD OF TIME WHETHER IT WAS FOR SCHOOL FOR MEETINGS FOR WORK AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE APPEAR WHAT AN ESSENTIAL PUBLIC SERVICE THE INTERNET AND BROADBAND ACCESS IS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS BUDGET PRIORITIZES RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING. IT CONTAINS TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION IN TOTAL RESERVES THE HIGHEST STATE RESERVE EVER AND IT FULLY PAYS OFF FOR EDUCATION FOR GIRLS. OUR PAST YEARS OF RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING OUR STATE'S PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM AND A MUCH NEEDED FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS HAVE MADE ALL OF THIS POSSIBLE. MEMBERS THIS BILL REPRESENTS A BUDGET AGREEMENT WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD OF I AM PROUD OF BEEN WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER MEMBERS DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR ATKINS. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU AND- COLLEAGUES WITH THANKS TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM BERKELEY OUR BUDGET CHAIR I FEEL LIKE I RISE TODAY WITH A GREAT SENSE OF OPTIMISM THANK YOU FOR THOSE- THE OUTLINE OF ALL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THIS BUDGET. FROM DAY ONE I'VE SAID THAT THIS BUDGET IS A ONCE IN A WHILE GENERATION OPPORTUNITY MAKE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE. A CHANCE TO NOT ONLY CHECK BOXES BUT TO CHANGE LIVES. AND THAT'S WHAT THE BUDGET PACKAGE BEFORE US TODAY DOES. WELL OUR STATE IS EMERGING FROM THE PANDEMIC MANY WORKING FAMILIES SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US ARE STILL STRUGGLING. EACH OF US HAS SPENT TIME ON THE GROUND IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND TALKING TO OUR NEIGHBORS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. THIS BUDGET IS A REFLECTION OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS IT'S A REFLECTION OF ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE VOICES AND INPUT. IT'S ALSO A PRODUCT OF THE GREAT PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE HAD WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND WE HAVE A STRONGER BUDGET TO SHOW FOR THAT. OF COURSE NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE IF NOT FOR THE TIRELESS WORK THAT MANY HOURS OUR STAFF IS DEDICATED TO IT. TO THE LA- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LEDGE COUNCIL AND OUR OWN BUDGET STAFF SO THANK YOU TO ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS BEEN A CHALLENGING YEAR. BUT YOU ROSE TO THE OCCASION. NOW OVER A DECADE OF RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING COMBINED WITH THE ROBUST FEDERAL STIMULUS ACTIONS WE RECEIVED THIS YEAR. AND A COMMON SENSE VOTER APPROVED REVENUE SYSTEM WE'RE IN A POSITION TO CREATE THE MOST RESPONSIBLE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE AND BOLD THE STATE BUDGET IN MODERN HISTORY. A BUDGET THAT WILL CONTINUE PUSHING OUR STATE FORWARD AS WE BUILD BACK. CREATING A PATH TO RECOVERY WIDE ENOUGH FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO SHARE. IT WILL HELP MOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS OPENED THEIR DOORS WELCOME IN A STREAM OF CUSTOMERS AND HIRE EMPLOYEES SO MORE PEOPLE CAN GET BACK TO WORK. FOR FAMILIES WITH OLDER CHILDREN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP REBOOT WILL MEAN NOT HAVING TO DIP INTO A FOUR OH ONE K. OR GO INTO DEBT TO GET A COLLEGE EDUCATION. AN IMPORTANT STEPPING STONE FOR MANY CREERS AND A KEY BUILDING BLOCK FOR A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS. THE EXPANDED NUTRITION BENEFITS WILL MEAN THAT PEOPLE SHUT OUT FROM THE FOOD ASSISTANCE DUE TO THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. WILL HAVE FULL BELLIES WHEN THEY CLOCK IN AT WORK OR GET OFF THE SCHOOL BUS. AFTER ALL. NO ONE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONCENTRATE LET ALONE SUCCEED WITH MOWING HUNGER IN THE PIT OF THEIR STOMACH. THE SAME GOES FOR YOU DO NOT HAVE A SAFE SECURE HOME TO RETURN HOME TO AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE RECORD LEVEL INVESTMENTS THIS PACKAGE MAKES IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING WILL MEAN THAT MORE FAMILIES WILL HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. AND A PLACE FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO DREAM AT NIGHT. SUMMER HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN BUT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS BEEN SWEATING THROUGH HIGH HEAT. AND INTENSIFYING DROUGHT. THE FUND'S LAID OUT IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL ENSURE FARMERS. BUSINESSES COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES THAT RELY ON WATER TO SURVIVE. ARE NOT LEFT DESERTED AS THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS WORSEN. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC I WAS REALLY BLOWN AWAY BY HOW CALIFORNIANS SHOWED UP FOR EACH OTHER FOR ONE ANOTHER. THE NEIGHBORS WHO CHECKED IN THE FOLKS WHO SEWED MASK THE FOOD BANK VOLUNTEERS THAT DELIVERED BAGS OF GROCERIES AND HOT MEALS. THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT PUT THEIR OWN HEALTH AT RISK TO SHOW UP FOR US EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR COMMUNITY SHOWED US THE TRUE MEANING OF THE CALIFORNIA WAY. NOW AS WE CAN FOLLOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOLLOW THEIR LEAD WITH THIS BUDGET WE WILL EXTEND MORE OPPORTUNITY AND PROSPERITY TO EVERYONE ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD BACK FROM A VERY DIFFICULT YEAR.

THE FINDING OF THE UCLA LABOR CENTER AND IS RENOVATIONS AND RENAMING OF THAT SOONER AFTER CIVIL RIGHTS ICON. THE REVEREND JAMES LAWSON AND IT WILL BE NOW THE REVEREND JAMES LAWSON. CALL WORKERS JUSTICE CENTER THE FUNDING OF CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS TO ADDRESS INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. DESPITE BEING ONE OF THE NEWEST CAMPUSES IT'S IN. DIRE NEED OF REPAIR AND IT'S A CAMPUS THAT ROLLS OUT OF THE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE WATTS RIOTS SO IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT IN EDUCATING. A VERY DIVERSE POPULATION MORE SO THAN ANY OF OUR C. ISSUES IN THE STATE. AND ALSO FUNDING TO ASSIST CANNABIS EQUITY APPLICANTS AND LICENSEES WITH LICENSE FEE WAIVERS WHICH IS GREAT A GREATLY IMPORTANT. WE HEAR ON A REGULAR BASIS THE CHALLENGES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVING- ENTERING THE SPACE BUT WE KNOW. THE WARRANT DRUGS HAS HAD AN IMPACT IT'S HAD ON THOSE COMMUNITIES OF LOS FORTY YEARS.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR. SANDERS CAN WE TAKE A QUESTION YES HELLO PLEASE PROCEED. HOW DOES THE MEASURE RESTORED THE NET OPERATING LOSS DEDUCTION AND BUSINESS INCENTIVE TAX CREDITS THAT WERE SUSPENDED AND CAPTAIN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. LET ME CHECK I DON'T BELIEVE SO BUT ALLOW ME TO RETURN TO THAT ANSWER FOR YOU OKAY. WELL ON MY OWN TIME LET ME GIVE MY ARM OF TALKING POINTS ON SOMETHING I FEEL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE ACTION WAS TAKEN AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S STRATEGY TO CLOSE AN ESTIMATED FIFTY FOUR BILLION. DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT AND THAT WAS A DEFICIT THAT NEVER CAME TO FRUITION SUNSETTING THE SUSPENSION AND CAP WOULD ASSIST EMPLOYERS IN THEIR ECONOMIC RECOVERY INCENTIVIZE THEM TO REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA. THE BUSINESS INCENTIVE TAX CREDIT CAP WAS PARTICULARLY TROUBLING CONSIDERING MANY OF CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYERS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING CORBETT NINETEEN VACCINES AND ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ACTIVITY THE STATE SHOULD ENCOURAGE IT MATTERS VERY MUCH- CENTURY AND I IN MY DISTRICT. ADDITIONALLY WHAT IT WHAT THE BUDGET DOES NOT APPEAR TO DO THIS TO CLEAN ANY FUNDS TO REDUCE THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FIND OUT WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A TAX ON BUSINESSES OR TAKE ANY OTHER STEPS TO ASSIST BUSINESS WITH A COST REPAYMENT. WELL THERE ARE SOME ITEMS IN THE BUDGET THAT ARE CERTAINLY LAUDABLE WHEN WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE FATE AND THE- THE FINANCE OF THE EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF THE BUSINESSES IN THE STATE. THEY ARE THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF OUR ECONOMY THAT KEEPS THE STATE GOLDEN SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY SHOULDBE CONSIDERED AS WE GO FORWARD ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUSINESS NEEDS OUR HELP. IN IT EVERY TURN. THEY SEEM TO BE GET THE SHORT STEP. I GENOVA. THANK YOU SENATOR BATES INSIDERS CAN- WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES OR OR NOW I'LL JUST- RESPONDED I WAS CORRECT NO THIS BUDGET IS NOT. RESTORED THE NET. OPERATING LOSS TAX CREDIT HOWEVER THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TAX CREDITS AND GRANT PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. AT ASSISTING BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY COMPANY. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER CENTER EGLIN. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF A. B.

STRUCTURE FOR THAT THIS WILL GO A LONG LONG WAY TO HOPEFULLY ACTUALLY DOING THAT FIXING THESE ISSUES WHEN THESE FUNDS ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION PLUS FIFTY FIVE MILLION OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE MOBILE HEALTH CRISIS WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHY DO YOU HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE WHY CAN'T YOU CALL SOCIAL WORKER THESE MOBILE HEALTH CRISIS TEAMS WILL BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. THIS THIS MEMBERS OF SOMETHING THAT I CAN TELL YOU THE HUSBAND PILOT PROGRAMS FOR EVER SHOWING THE AT THE EFFICIENCY EFFICIENCY OF HAVING MOBILE UNITS IN ACTION MENTAL HEALTH WORKERS RESPOND OFTEN TIMES IN CONJUNCTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IT WORKS BUT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND IT BEFORE- AT SIX POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR REDUCING CALIFORNIA DISPARITIES I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT LOOK AROUND THE STATE WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AND I UNDERSTAND THE DISPARITIES THAT ARE GOING ON. ALSO THE ISSUES OF FOOD INSECURITY AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS AN AGRICULTURE DISTRICT- AND IT LIVES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT. KNOW THAT HAVE SOME. HUNG PEOPLE. TOTALLY BREAKS ALL OF OUR HEARTS. AND I'M SURE ALL OF US. WERE AT SOME KIND OF FOOD THEY GIVE AWAY SOME KIND OF FOOD SOMETHING THAT WE DID OVER THE PANDEMIC AND AMOUNT OF PEOPLE COMING IN.

OUT BETTER MEALS ON WHEELS TODAY REALLY REDUCE. INSECURITY I KEEP SAYING THAT TALK ABOUT MEDICARE FOR ALL AND EVERYTHING FOR ALL THAT FOR GOODNESS SAKES WE CAN'T DO FOOD FOR ALL. WE HAVE IT HERE LET'S GET IT OUT TO THE FOLKS. THIS BUDGET GOES A LONG WAY TOWARDS DOING THAT- WE ALSO FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR A LONG TIME ARE ABLE TO REALLY. MAKE HEADWAY ON THE D. D. I. D. RATES AT THE RATE STUDIES WE KEEP SAYING THAT WE NEED TO. PAY FOLKS EMBRACE NEED TO BE. MATCHING A LOT OF FOLKS IN THAT. THE DD POPULATION. CARE GIVERS WERE STILL WORKING DESPITE COVERT DESPITE EVERYTHING. OFTEN TIMES NOT BEING ABLE. TO GET. REIMBURSED FOR THAT. THE ARE SO MANY THINGS IN THIS BUDGET. I DON'T THINK IT'S LOST ANY OF US AGAIN THE DISPARITIES THAT EXISTED THE ABILITY TO EXPAND MEDICAID ALL DOWN TO FIFTY. UP FOR PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF DOCUMENTATION STATUS WE KNOW THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN WORKING OUT IN OUR FIELD AND- IN OUR RESTAURANTS AND ALL AROUND FOR YEARS- THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ESPECIALLY IN YOUR FIFTIES AS WHEN.

WITH THAT I'D URGE AND I VOTE ON SB ONE TWENTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR PAM CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. SUMMARIZE FOR MOMENT AND FIRST OFF I WANT TO TAKE THE BUDGET CHAIR- I LIKE- THE SIMILAR FROM SENATE SENATOR FROM FRESNO- I GOT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT ON THE BUDGET IN A SUB COMMITTEE SO I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRS ALSO- THIS IS THE LARGEST BUDGET IN THE STATE'S HSTORY HUNTER NINETY SIX BILLION DOLLARS A GENERAL FUND. SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THERE'S A LOT IN HERE THERE'S A LOT TO IT THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE THERE'S A LOT TO BE FOR ME NERVOUS ABOUT ABOUT HOW IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE IMPLEMENTED. LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN BROADBAND. NOW SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED ON BROADWAY AND YOU GUYS HAVE HEARD ME TALK ABOUT BROADBAND BUT HOW IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO GET TO THE GROUND AND HOW'S IT GONNA AFFECT. THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE ALL SERVE AND THOSE WHO ARE UNDER. THE UNDER SERVED OR NOT SERVED. THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS. AND THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF WORK. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD ON HOW WE ACTUALLY. DRIVE IT HOME. AND SO I WANT TO JUST CHALLENGE FOR BROADBAND. FOR PRISON REALIGNMENT. FOR DROUGHT AND FIRE. DID MEMBERS WELL I'M CHALLENGING YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY DO A GOOD JOB OF SHEPHERDING IT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR CALIFORNIANS IS THAT WE ACTUALLY STRETCH THIS MONEY OUT AND WE GET THE SERVICES THAT WE HAVE PROVIDED. IN THIS BUDGET TO THEM. AND I WANT TO SHARE ONE LAST THING THAT IS REALLY DEAR TO ME I'M- AS YOU ALL KNOW. A GENERATION OF MY FAMILY FARM HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M NOT PLANNING ON LEAVING CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVE. WHAT WE TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. GIVING US ALL THIS MONEY WE ARE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE ARE IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL. TWENTY EIGHT POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND THOSE WHO OF US THAT HAVE CHILDREN AND ARE LOOKING TO THE FUTURE FOR THEM. EVERY SINGLE MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA IS IN DEBT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ROSLYN DALLY WHO IS ELEVEN YEARS OLD IS IN DEBT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR THOSE YOU HAVE SMALL CHILDREN BABIES THERE AND AT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE MUST DO A GREAT JOB IN STRETCHING OUR RESOURCES AND GET THE SERVICE YOU NEED AND START LOOKING AT A WAY TO DRAW DOWN THE DEBT THERE WERE PILING UP ON THE GENERATIONS THAT FOLLOW US IF WE REALLY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SO I WANT TO JUST CHALLENGE YOU WITH THAT I WANT TO SAY THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT THINGS THIS BUDGET BUT I'M ALSO. WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DELIVER WHAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO DELIVER. A FEW YEARS BACK FOR EXAMPLE WE PASSED A WATER BOND. SEVEN A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. TO BUILD TO BUILD STORAGE. AND ACTUALLY PRODUCE MORE WATER FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT TODAY I'M NOT WHERE OF ONE GALLON OF WATER THAT'S BEEN CREATED MORE. SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO STAND UP AND SAY I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE NOW IS MOVING FORWARD. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY DO WHAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO AND DELIVER THE SERVICES IN A- EFFICIENT STREAMLINED MANNER TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR DELHI CENTRE TORONTO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM I'M VERY PROUD OF THE OUR BUDGET- SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE THE MEMBERS WE WORKED HARD ON THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REFERENCED PUBLIC SAFETY TRANSPORTATION LABOR EMERGENCY SERVICES AND JUDICIAL I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. HI RISE BECAUSE I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD. OF THIS BUDGET WE ARE SENDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK TONIGHT. BECAUSE IT INCLUDES FUNDING TO INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY FIFTY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AGES FIFTY AND OVER. AND INTO THE FULL SCOPE OF MEDICARE L. REGARDLESS OF STATUS. THIS LATEST INCLUSION OF CALIFORNIANS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED YEARS OF HARD WORK AND ADVOCACY. MY HEALTH FOR ALL BUSINESS ACADEMIA GRASSROOTS COALITION PRIOR TO THIS THE HEALTH FOR ALL COALITION HAD SECURED THE INCLUSION OF YOUNG CHILDREN INTO MEDICARE ALL IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN OUR LEGISLATURE INCLUDED YOUNG ADULTS UP TO THE AGES OF TWENTY FIVE. BUT UNTIL NOW UNDOCUMENTED PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS. WHO TAKE THEIR CHILD OR GRANDCHILD TO THE DOCTOR COULD NOT GET. SERVICE FOR THEMSELVES ONLY UNLESS IT WAS AN EMERGENCY CARE. MORE THAN HALF OF UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS ARE PART OF MIXED STATUS FAMILIES TWO THIRDS HAVE LIVED IN THE US MORE THAN TEN YEARS ALL CONTRIBUTING OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND LOCAL AND STATE TAXES. THEY HELPED TO FUND THE MEDICAL THAT THEY COULD NOT ACCESS NOW THESE CALIFORNIANS WILL FINALLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE IF AND WHEN THEY NEEDED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS A WHOLE WILL BE MORE PROSPEROUS PROSPEROUS AND HEALTHIER. R. C. HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WORKS BEST WHEN ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE TREATMENT. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP OF OUR PRO TEM AND OUR GOVERNOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT TO ADDRESS THIS INJUSTICE. LET'S CONTINUE TO REALIZE HEALTH CARE AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS- CENTER HERTZBERG. THANKS VERY MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU MINUTE BUDGET CHAIR. IN EACH OF THE SUB COMMITTEE CHAIRS OF WORK SO HARD I WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE POINTS IN. ADD SOME CONTEXT AS WE DEAL WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGE OF PUTTING TOGETHER THIS BUDGET DOCUMENT WHICH GUIDES CALIFORNIA. THE PRO TEM LAST YEAR PUT TOGETHER A WORKING GROUP OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY INCLUDING MYSELF AND THE SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA TEN SENATORS FROM THIS HOUSE FIFTEEN MEMBERS FROM THE OTHER HOUSE ALL OF WHOM PUT TOGETHER A ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE. BUT THE PACKAGE. WAS ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE WOULD BRING. THAT IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN THIS GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF HOW OUR BUDGET WORKS. THE MAYOR OF SACRAMENTO FORMER P. T. WAS HERE WHEN THERE WAS SIXTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICITS BY TWO OF MY HISTORY BEING HERE EXTRAORDINARY DEFICITS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS IT'S A HORTON SERVICES ARE CUT OFF IT MEANS EMPLOYEES ARE FURLOUGHED IT MEANS THAT THE COST OF RESTARTING IS EXTRAORDINARY WE HAVE THIS UNBELIEVABLY VOLATILE SYSTEM. AND HERE WE FACE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE AND THE UNBELIEVABLE UNEXPECTED DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE IN CAPITAL GAINS. CRAZY AMOUNT OF MONEY. IT'S SO FROM SOMEONE WITH MY PERSPECTIVE WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN IS IN ADDITION TO SUPPLEMENTING SO MANY OF THE SERVICES AND PROVIDING AND FIXING SO MANY OF THE HOLES THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET FOR THE LONG TERM. TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVES. TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO BILLION. IN THE OLD DAYS WE JUST HAD A SMALL MAYBE A BILLION DOLLAR HALF A BILLION DOLLARS REMEMBER THIS A- SENATOR IN THE OLD DAYS WE HAD A SMALL DOLLAR RESERVE. UNDER THE A BUDGET. THAT WAS REQUIRED NOW WE HAVE FOUR FOR RESERVES WE HAVE ASSOCIATE WE HAVE ONE FOR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. EDUCATION THE BIG RAINY DAY FUND PLUS THE RESERVE ACCOUNT. UNPRECEDENTED BUT WHY IS THAT NECESSARY. BECAUSE IT'S RESPONSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO THINK LONG TERM TO PROTECT AGAINST THE VOLATILITY THAT WE FACE AND THE IMPACT IT HAS EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE PAID DOWN MY FIRST WHEN I WAS GOING GOVERNMENT BEFORE. WE HAD WITHIN WEEKS OF MY ELECTION. A HUGE OBLIGATION UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT WE TAKE OFF THAT OBLIGATION COMPLETELY AND GIVEN US TOOLS FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS. TO BE ABLE TO AS WE GO FORWARD AND HAVE THIS VOLATILITY TO BE ABLE TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT. PAYING DOWN DEBT HUGE RESERVES FORTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS I THINK THE NUMBER WAS. A ONE TIME REVENUES FIXING A LOT OF UNDERLYING PROBLEMS. BUT DOING IT IN A WAY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE LONG TERM CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IN CALIFORNIA. SO INDEED IS THE- PRO TEM MENTIONED IS THE BUDGET CHAIR MENTIONED IS THE CHAIR SUBCOMMITTEE SHARES MENTION IN TERMS OF FIXING A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS. WANTED TO STEP BACK AND LOOK AT THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT FUTURE GENERATIONS. AS WE DEAL WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO FACE. THIS EXPANDING GROWING CHANGING CALIFORNIA WERE LOOK THE FINANCIAL LANDSCAPE IS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE DEALT WITH SO MANY OF THE ISSUES WERE MENTIONED RELATED TO BUSINESS AND RELATED. TO SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THE BUDGET TO WORK TO KILL IT. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE THAT STATEMENT ABOUT THE LONG TERM VIEW ABOUT THE RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING ABOUT PROVIDING THE NECESSARY TOOLS GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FACE CHALLENGES AS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE DONE IN THE PAST AND FOR THAT I WANTED TO ADD THAT MY COMMENTS TO EXPRESS THAT DIMENSION OF WHY I THINK. THIS BUDGET HAS ELEGANCE IS APPROPRIATE. AND I CAN STAND AND PROUDLY VOTE FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG CENTER CALLED LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET- I'M PROUD OF THIS BUDGET AND GRATEFUL TO. THE CHAIR OF OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ARE SOME CHAIRS FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY DID I THINK. YOU KNOW I'M A NEWLY ELECTED TO THIS BODY AND I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S KINDA NEAT THAT THE FIRST REAL BUSINESS WE'VE DONE IN A BODY AS A BODY HERE TOGETHER IS TO VOTE ON A BUDGET THAT'S GOING TO HELP ALL OF CALIFORNIANS I MEAN. LIKE I SAID I THINK THIS IS PRETTY COOL. AND THERE ARE SOME GREAT THINGS IN THIS BUDGET YOU KNOW THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PUBLIC HOSPITALS. THAT SERVE THE FOLKS THAT NEED HEALTH CARE THE MOST. THERE'S FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GOING TO THE INSTITUTE FOR REPRODUCTIVE% HEALTH. IT'S IN THAT PARTICULAR SPACE. FUNDING OUR MOBILE CRISIS UNITS AMEN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE CRISIS ACT FOR TWO YEARS. ALL I CAN SAY TO THAT IS AMEN WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED THE ARTS. THE ARTS IN OUR ARTS ORGANIZATIONS THAT HEAL US AND EMBRACE US WHEN NO ONE ELSE SEEMS TO DO IT. URBAN FARMS SENIOR FARM PROGRAMS WE NOW WILL HAVE A HOSPITAL IN SOUTH LA. THAT HAS BEEN TREATING. MORE HOMELESS AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN LA THAN ANY OTHER FACILITY. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN EFFORTS TO KEEP OUR YOUTH OUT OF OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM I SEE THIS AS AN ECONOMIC JUSTICE BUDGET. AND IN REALITY WE ARE WRITING SOME SHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN SINKING FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. BECAUSE WE HAVE SKIRTED REALLY DEEP AND MEANINGFUL INVESTMENTS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON FOR THIS STATE FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND WE NOW HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DIG DEEPLY AND TO INVEST IN COMMUNITIES THAT PROBABLY FEEL LIKE WE HAVE FORGOTTEN THEM. I SEE THIS BUDGET. AS A DOWN PAYMENT ON A NEW KIND OF CALIFORNIA. WHERE ALL BOATS ARE LIFTED AND I'M HOPING THAT WE WILL STAY COMMITTED TO THIS I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE SURPLUS AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE DECIDED TO DOUBLE DOWN ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE TO SAY I SEE YOU I SEE YOU CALIFORNIA. THEN I AM INVESTED IN MAKING THINGS RIGHT THAT WE HAVE LEFT MARGINALIZED OR THAT WE HAVE PUT DUCT TAPE ON AND WE HAVE HOPED THAT NOTHING WOULD POP OFF AND START LEAKING LAST YEAR THINGS LEAKED. AND SOME THINGS THANK. AND WE ARE HERE TO LIFT THEM UP SO I AM PROUD OF THIS BUDGET GRATEFUL THAT I'M HERE WHEN WE HAVE MONEY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO GIVE IT ACROSS THIS STATE AND I URGE I VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CALM WATER SENATOR MAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO THANK OUR LEADERS- BOTH ON THE BUDGET STAFF- AS WELL AS A MAN APPROACHED HIM AND- FOR ALL YOUR HARDWARE IN MAJORITY LEADER OF COURSE FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BUDGET- I AM CAME INTO OFFICE AT THE BEGINNING THIS YEAR AND- WE HAVE COURSES FACE. IT SO MANY CHALLENGES OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF- CHALLENGES THAT DIDN'T HAVE A PLAYBOOK AND THERE WAS OF COURSE A LOT OF SECOND GUESSING A LOT OF MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACKING ABOUT WHETHER CALIFORNIA IS DOING THE RIGHT THING WHETHER WE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE FLORIDA OR TEXAS OR OTHER STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND YET AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS CLEAR WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MERGE MORE STRONGLY THAN ANY OTHER STATE- WE HAVE ECONOMIC MIGHT BEHIND US RIGHT NOW AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT WE DO ABOUT THAT. NOW THEY SAY THAT BUDGETS ARE REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AND THAT'S WHY I WAS SO PROUD TO VOTE FOR THIS BUDGET EARLIER TODAY AND BUDGET COMMITTEE. BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET THAT BALANCES THE SHORT TERM PRIORITIES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SHORT TERM PRIORITIES COMING OUT OF IT. WITH THE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED TO MAKE. NOW I WANT TO BUILD ON THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER BECAUSE I AGREE WITH THEM WE HAVE TWENTY EIGHT POINT SOMETHING BILLION TRILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS AND I WERE ABOUT WHAT MY KIDS ON HERE. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASK HOW WE GOT HERE AND WE GOT HERE BECAUSE THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARGUE FOR GET RICH QUICK SCHEMES LET'S GIVE MONEY THE RICHEST AND THAT'LL PAY FOR ITSELF IT WILL BE ALL STRONGER CIRCLE. AND AS A RESULT WE DIS INVESTED IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE STATE. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO INVESTING IN OUR LONG TERM PRIORITIES AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA IS SO STRONGLY PUT TODAY. TO DO SO WELL. WELL THE RESORT. SO STRONG IS BECAUSE WE INVESTED HEAVILY IN OUR EDUCATION HIGHER ED. AND OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT DOWN PAYMENT AS MY COLLEAGUE SAID BEFORE. BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE THIS HISTORIC SURPLUS. AND WE HAVE A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO INVEST. TO BUILD. THE BACKBONE OF OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY. AND SHARED PROSPERITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO I WILL VOTE YES ON THIS BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THIS IS A VOTE FOR OUR FUTURE IN THIS STATE. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU SAID IRVINE CENTER LAYERED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THIS IS THE SECOND DEBATE WE'VE HAD ON THIS BILL TODAY- AND IT WAS INTERESTING TO REFLECT THAT THIS MORNING AND- BUDGET COMMITTEE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT MAYBE THE PROCESS WAS OPAQUE OR PEOPLE HAD NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN AND IT WAS CLOSED OFF HERE AT THE END. AND YET JUST SPEAKING FOR THE EDUCATION BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WE HAD THIRTEEN HERE SO OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHEN WE VOTED IN THE END WE VOTED ON ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL ITEMS ALL OF WHICH WE HAD DISCUSSED AND VETTED IN THE PROCESS. AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT THAT WHEN WE HEARD THE TESTIMONY WE RESPONDED. WE HAD TESTIMONY IN A JOINT HEARING WITH SENATOR ARGUMENTS COMMITTEE ON CHILD CARE. AND PEOPLE SAID THIS IS THE TICKET TO ECONOMIC SECURITY OR HELP FOR SO MANY PEOPLE IF IT IS OFFERED WE RESPOND TO IT WITH MORE SLOTS AND BETTER PAY. IT WAS SUGGESTED IN THOSE HEARINGS BY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT IT JUST WASN'T RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WE WERE GIVEN AND NOT PAY OFF ALL THE DEFERRALS. THAT AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE FLUSH THAT'S THE TIME TO PAY OFF DEBT. AND WE DID WE RESPOND IT'S IN THIS BUDGET WHEN IT WASN'T IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET. AND IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT STUDENT AID IS NARROW THAT IT IS OFFERED TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND WE'RE ADDING AT LEAST A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND MAYBE AN EQUAL AMOUNT MORE. TO REALLY MOVE MANY MANY CALIFORNIANS TO A DEBT FREE COLLEGE. AND IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT FOR TWENTY YEARS THE AGRICULTURAL ADVISORS AND THE PHARMACY VISORS AND YOU SEE I GET EXTENSION HAS BEEN STAGNANT LAYING PEOPLE OFF AND NOT HELPING OUR FARMERS. WE ARE BRINGING IT BACK TO WHERE I WAS YEARS AND YEARS AGO IN RESPONSE TO THAT TESTIMONY. AND THERE WERE PARENTS OF KIDS WHERE THEY HAD APPLIED TO UC AND THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH SPACES BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS IN A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER TAKING THOSE SPACES AND WE HAVE A PROPOSAL HERE THAT IS IN THE BUDGET. TO DEAL WITH THE THREE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE THE MOST OUT OF STATE STUDENTS AND BACK FILL IT AND TOGETHER WITH ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDE MANY MORE SPACES. FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. AND WE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. ABOUT CHILD DEVELOPMENT ABOUT THE NEED FOR PRE K. OR MORE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR MORE CHILD CARE OPPORTUNITIES PRIOR TO KIDS COMING INTO SCHOOL AND IN A HISTORIC WAY. THIS BUDGET ADDRESSES THAT. ADDITIONALLY WHEN WE ADOPTED THE BUDGET AROUND JUNE FIFTEENTH IT WAS SUGGESTED. THAT THAT BUDGET WAS IRRESPONSIBLE THERE WAS A BUDGET LIKE TWENTY YEARS AGO LIKE A BUDGET THAT LED INTO THE DOLDRUMS POLITICALLY IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY YEARS AGO. WELL THIS BUDGET HAS A RECORD AMOUNT OF RESERVES TWENTY FIVE BILLION IN TOTAL BUT IS MORE THAN IS EVER EVEN CONTEMPLATED ANYTIME WE HAVE ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT GOES TO BUSINESSES AND WITH STIMULUS TO INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC IT REALLY HELPS LIFT PEOPLE UP. AND THEN WE PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS WE PAY OFF DEBT AND OR OR THINGS LIKE THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR ACCOUNT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION BUILDINGS WERE NORMALLY. WE WOULD BE PUTTING THOSE IN BONDS AND WOULD BE INCURRING TO AT THIS TIME WE'RE MAKING THE EXPENDITURE IN A DEBT FREE WAY GETTING A 100% OF THE VALUE AND NOT INCURRING INTEREST PAYMENTS. AND SO WE HERE WE GO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLE FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET WE RESPONDED TO THE PUBLIC WE DO SO MANY THINGS- ONE TIME IN RESPONSE TO THE FACT THAT IT'S ONE TIME MONEY. BUT THEN WE ARE WE GO AFTER THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN INTRACTABLE FOR SO LONG AND BUDGET FOR IMPACT AND MAKE A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR DECADES TO HAVE STUDENT AID THAT HELPS PEOPLE. WE'VE BEEN WAITING TO REACH STORE OUR SCHOOLS TO THE LEVELS FINANCIALLY THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WE'RE ADDING 5% AT ALL LEVELS BUT WITH CHILD CARE WE'RE DOING A HISTORIC CONDITION. WITH HOMELESSNESS WE'RE GOING TO ADD IT IN AN IMPACTFUL WAY WITH MORE RESOURCES. THAN COULD EVEN BE CONTEMPLATED. WHICH DO AID BRING HOME OF MORE PEOPLE. AND WITH OUR OWN CRISES DUE TO CLIMATE WITH WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT WE HAVE MONEY TO ADDRESS THOSE IN SIGNIFICANT WAYS SO THIS BUDGET IS REALLY PRUDENT. WITH REGARD TO DATA WITH REGARD TO RESERVES. THE THIS IS ADDRESSES OUR MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS AND IT MOVES US AHEAD IN A WAY THAT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS HAD A BUDGET LIKE THIS IN FRONT OF THEM FOR GENERATIONS IF NOT MUCH MORE. WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS BUDGET AND I'M GONNA PROBABLY CAST AND I FOCUSED. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HAS AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR ALL HEIR WORK I KNOW IT'S A IT'S A METS AMOUNT OF TIME LABOR- TAKING A LOT OF INPUT AND WHEN I ANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE'VE HEARD THE WORD HISTORIC TONIGHT HOW ABOUT THIS BUDGET. AND HONESTLY. IT'S IS HISTORIC IN THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'VE LOST. WHEN I DO THIS BUDGET HIGHS I THINK THE TWO THINGS I THINK THE BANDAIDS IN ANTIBIOTICS. THIS BUDGET. IS NOT INVESTING IN ORDINARY CALIFORNIANS IS INVESTING IN THE GOVERNOR'S A SHORT TERM POLITICAL FEATURE. TO THE DETRIMENT OF LONG TERM DETRIMENT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. YOU KNOW US SENATE REPUBLICANS WE OFFERED LOGICAL SOLUTIONS. THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED ORDINARY CALIFORNIANS BY SAVING SMALL BUSINESSES. PROTECTING JOBS REFORMING ET DE ESTABLISH ESTABLISHING A GAS TAX HOLIDAY AND BRINGING ACCOUNTABILITY TO ALL FIRE BUT WE WERE WE ARE SHUT OUT OF THE PROCESS. I WANT TO REMIND YOU WE GET PICKED ON A LOT OF THE SLOWER BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY NINE OF US. BUT WE REPRESENT A MILLION PEOPLE EACH US NINE MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S THE SAME SIZE AS A STATE IN NEW JERSEY. US AS A REPUBLICAN CAUCUS WE HAVE TEN ELECTORAL VOTES IF WE WERE OUR OWN STATE. AND SO. IT IS IT IS IT WE COULD WE COULD HAVE DONE MORE WE COULD DATE IS ARE GOOD THINGS IN THIS BILL OF COURSE THERE IS MENTION THIS KIND OF MONEY THERE THERE HAS TO BE. BUT I'VE BEEN UP HERE LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM STOCK TO NINE YEARS NOW AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT IT'S JUST NOT GONNA BE TODAY'S NOT COULD BE TOMORROW IT COULD BE NEXT WEEK. BUT THIS IS DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN BECAUSE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE GONNA BE BACK THE SAME PLACE HIGHER TAXES AND THEN HAVING TO CUT PROGRAMS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SUSTAINABLE PATHWAY FORD. TO BRING- TO BRING ALL OF ALL BOATS UP AS MENTIONED EARLIER SO THIS BUDGET ACTUALLY MAKES ME SAD IS NOT MAKE ME HAPPY AND- I KNOW THERE IS YOU KNOW A BIG EFFORT INTO IT BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK SENATOR NIELSEN. MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES GENTLEMAN THE SENATE. I WILL STAND BY MY REMARKS HISTORICALLY AND PERSISTENTLY OVER THE BUDGET PROCESS. I CONSIDER THAT STILL DISAPPOINTING. BUT SETTING THAT ASIDE AS WE WIND UP THIS BUDGET I WANT TO THANK THE PROTEST FOR ALLOWING ME TO SERVE ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE DOESN'T HAVE MOST OF MY CAREER. IT'S THE TOUGHEST COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE BY FAR AND ALL MATTER AND WORRIES. AND THE LABORS ARE MIGHTY BUT THE CONTRIBUTIONS CAN BE MIGHTY AS WELL ON THAT COMMITTEE SO I APPRECIATE THAT OPPORTUNITY. I ALSO HAVE ENJOYED SERVING WITH THE CHAIR. AS I HAVE HER PREDECESSORS DATING ALL THE WAY BACK TO SENATOR AL RATO. WHOSE FIRST BIG CHALLENGE I THINK IS A SENATOR AND HE'D BEEN THERE A LONG TIME. WAS DEALING WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND THAT WAS THE YEAR THAT I ARRIVED IN THIS INSTITUTION. WELL OUT OF COURSE IS ANOTHER GEM. OF A LEADER THERE'S A BUST OF HIM I THINK IN THE BUDGET OFFICE STILL AROUND TO REMIND US OF AL'S EFFORTS. ESPECIALLY ENJOYED MY TIME WITH MARK LENO. HAVE YOU WOULD NOT THINK THAT HE AND I WOULD AGREE ON MUCH OF ANYTHING BUT WE SURELY DID. IT'S A GOOD PROCESS. IT HAS BEEN AND IT STILL CAN BE I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A VERY. GREAT COMMOTE COMMENDATION TO THE DEMOCRATIC BUDGET STAFF AND THE REPUBLICAN BUDGET STAFF. THE DEMOCRATIC STAFF OF REALLY GONE OUT OF THEIR WAY TO BE HELPFUL TO THE REPUBLICAN STAFF GETTING THIS INFORMATION. AND I APPRECIATE THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AND IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO PROCEED IN OUR HEARINGS. SO I CREATE THAT AND I WANT TO THANK THE- THE CHAIRS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HARDER JOB TOO BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO PREPARE FOR EACH OF THE HEARINGS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF HEARING. I AGREE WITH THAT. I WILL ASK SO IN THE FUTURE THAT WE ALLOW MORE PUBLIC INPUT BEYOND THAT. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE MEMBERS AND THE PRO TEM AND THE BUDGET CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AND WORK WITH. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON. SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I SAYS I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BUDGET ON SO MANY LEVELS.
