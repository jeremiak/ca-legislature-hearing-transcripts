AND YET THAT OF THE CAMPUSES IN

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:50.902
THE NIGHT OF STUDENTS THAT THIS

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:52.470
ISSUES POTENTIALLY HAD WAS THERE

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:53.671
ANY CONVERSATION I THOUGHT

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:54.806
BEHIND THAT.

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:58.710

YOU KNOW THIS IS A COMMON

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:07.585
QUESTION ASKED THAT WHEN THESE

KINDS OF THINGS ARE PUT FORWARD

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.188
AND I THINK THAT.

00:33:10.254 --> 00:33:11.522
MY FEELING HAS BEEN THAT THEY

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.391
BOTH HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS THAT

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:14.625
WON'T EVEN BE MATCHED BY IT BY

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.528
THIS MEASURE -- AND THAT -- I IN

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.296
THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:19.564
COALITION THE THAT'S BEEN PUT

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.165
TOGETHER BEHIND THIS I THINK THE

00:33:21.232 --> 00:33:22.900
EVE EVEN SPLIT IS I THINK

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:23.935
SOMETHING THAT BOTH SYSTEMS ARE

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:24.769
COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:28.106
AND I CERTAINLY AM AND THAT'S

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:28.740

A HUGE AMOUNT OF OUR ADDITIONAL

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:11.916
OF FIRST OF FOR THROUGH THE OUR

00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:14.318
ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHMENT.

00:34:14.385 --> 00:34:16.354
OF THE BUILDING WHEN THEY ARE

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:19.924
BUILT -- TO WHAT THEY JUST A

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.559
BILL THAN THE NORM MAINTENANCE

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:22.860
COSTS SO.

00:34:22.927 --> 00:34:24.796
MANAGERS ABILITY IN IN THE CHEN

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:27.965
ARE BUDGET THAT THE UC'S WAS CSU

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:28.933
RECEIVER.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.738
WITH THE UNIT TO A SET ASIDE --

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:35.773
BUILDING -- MAINTENANCE COSTA

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.076
SEPARATELY SL ONE QUESTION.

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:44.315
NUMBER TWO IS -- HOW LONG?

00:34:44.382 --> 00:34:45.450
WITH THE SEC EIGHT BILLION

DOLLARS AT THAT TO RECREATE THAT

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:48.719
THAT WILL.

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:51.589
MAINTAIN IS A CARIBBEAN NEXT A

00:34:51.656 --> 00:34:54.091
FIFTY YEARS OR IN PERPETUITY OR

00:34:54.158 --> 00:34:59.096
JUST A TEN YEARS [inaudible]

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:00.364
O'DONNELL [inaudible]

00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:04.769
AND AND THE QUESTION IS THAT --

00:35:04.836 --> 00:35:07.772
CALIFORNIA HAS SOME.

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:10.508
EXTRA ORDINARY MONO OF SURPLUS

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:11.809
RIGHT NOW I CAN'T EXACTLY

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:15.680
REMEMBER TO MY MEMORY ELECT THE

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:18.149
TWENTY ONE P. AND DAUGHTERS --

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.718
WHY CAN WE SEE YOU -- SELL US

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:21.719
SOME OF THAT THE MONEY ONE TIME

00:35:21.786 --> 00:35:23.688
MONEY THAT WITHOUT COSTING ANY

00:35:23.754 --> 00:35:25.890
ADDITIONAL TAX BURDEN OF BURDEN

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:30.261
ON THE CITIZENS -- THOSE ARE THE

00:35:30.328 --> 00:35:32.296
DUTCH GENERAL QUESTIONS SO I

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:38.669
COME TO REALIZE SO -- BEFORE A

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:40.905
WEEK COSTA DISCOUNT ABOUT TEN

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:43.174
ARCHITECT.

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:44.775
OKAY WELL LET ME TRY TO GIVE IT

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.377
A SHOT AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:46.844
MAY.

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:50.181
WANT TO ENHANCE MY ANSWERS.

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:50.848
I THINK PART OF THE REASON WE

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:52.717
HAD THE VINES IS IT SIGNIFICANT

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.285
TODAY IS BECAUSE THAT WE FALL

00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:56.354
OUT IT TO DETERIORATE WITHOUT

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.122
REALLY RESPONSE OVER MANY MANY

00:35:58.189 --> 00:35:59.390
DECADES.

00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:01.959
AND SO THEY'RE THERE FOR THE

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:03.794
THINGS GET OLDER AND WE HAVE TO

00:36:03.861 --> 00:36:05.196
FIND SOME WAY TO CATCH UP AND

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:06.531
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE THE BONDS

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:09.600
PROPOSED AS IT IS SET BEFORE YOU --

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.068
THERE THERE IS MAKING HIS MONEY

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.370
THAT IS PROVIDED TO MAINTAIN

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:13.638
THESE FACILITIES OVER THE YEARS

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:14.672
BUT THAT'S BEEN SUBJECT TO THE

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:16.407
BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE ALL

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:17.408
PARTICIPATE.

00:36:17.475 --> 00:36:18.943
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE BUDGET THAT

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.511
WE WILL BE POTENTIALLY VOTING ON

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.779
THIS WEEK.

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:23.548
DOES PROVIDE AFFABLE SYSTEMS

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.882
SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE MONEY TO

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:26.217
TRY TO KEEP THOSE FACILITIES

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:27.451
RUNNING.

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:28.452
AND USABLE.

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:30.288
AND THAT OF COURSE IS SUBJECT

00:36:30.354 --> 00:36:31.889
EVERY YEAR TO THE BUDGET PROCESS.

00:36:31.956 --> 00:36:32.924
THIS ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH MORE

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.026
THE THE CAPITAL NEEDS THAT ARE

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:37.361
OUT THERE -- HAS THE LABS AND

00:36:37.428 --> 00:36:39.730
CLASSROOMS OF DETERIORATED SAID

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.933
THEY'RE NOT USABLE -- AND IN

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:43.601
MANY WAYS.

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:45.102
THIS IS ABOUT PAYING IT FORWARD

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.504
JUST LIKE OUR PARENTS PAID IT

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.573
FORWARD FOR THE FACILITIES THAT

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:49.173
WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.541
OF OVER.

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:52.243
MANY YEARS -- IN THE PAST.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.312
AND SO IT HAS A LIFE A LIFE

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.681
FLOOD OF FOR THESE NEW

00:36:56.747 --> 00:37:00.718
FACILITIES OR THE THE

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.453
RECONSTRUCTION IS THE XISTING

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.988
FACILITIES OF ANOTHER OF DECADES

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:04.922
INTO THE FUTURE.

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:06.524
SO THE THE BONDS WILL BE PAID

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:09.193
OFF -- OVER THIRTY FORTY YEARS

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:10.695
THE FACILITIES THAT WILL BE

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.663
PROVIDED IN THIS MEASURE WILL BE

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.165
THERE FOR THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS.

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:16.067
AND SO IT IS TRYING TO CATCH UP

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:17.101
WITH.

00:37:17.168 --> 00:37:18.269
THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T

00:37:18.336 --> 00:37:20.938
MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES AS AS

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:21.872
WE WOULD LIKE.

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.641
TO AND THE CHANGING REQUIREMENTS

00:37:23.708 --> 00:37:25.977
OF OUR OUR ECONOMY AND OUR

00:37:26.043 --> 00:37:27.545
EDUCATION WORLD TODAY.

00:37:27.612 --> 00:37:29.480
THAT WE CAN PAY IT FORWARD --

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.581
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:32.216
STUDENTS SO THAT BE MY MULTI

00:37:32.283 --> 00:37:35.453
PRONGED ANSWER TIER THREE

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:37.655
QUESTIONS.

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:38.522
HAVE YOU ATTEMPTED -- TO OF

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:39.423
GOVERNANCE BUDGET BUT THAT THEY

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:40.391
CAN USE THAT THE AN EXTRA MONEY

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:41.592
THE US.

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:42.960
WELL HE HAS IS PROVIDING SOME

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.562
MAINTENANCE MONEY I IN THE

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:45.563
BUDGET.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:47.131
BUT YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THIS BOND

00:37:47.198 --> 00:37:48.799
THAT THE OBLIGATION AT LEAST AT

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.034
THE LAST GOVERNOR.

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.636
SERVE FOR EIGHT YEARS WAS TO PUT

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:53.137
THAT -- REQUIREMENT ON TO THE

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.639
SYSTEMS THEMSELVES.

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.073
AND BY DOING SO IT MEANT THAT

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.275
THE THAT THE OBLIGATION FOR THAT

00:37:58.342 --> 00:37:59.143
CAPITAL.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.545
HAD AT AT HAD A AS A POSSIBILITY

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:03.314
THAT WOULD WOULD BE -- FUNDED BY

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:04.348
TWO WHICH SHOULD.

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:05.783
TUITION INCREASES THAT NONE OF

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:07.818
US HERE LIKE -- BUT THAT THAT

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.420
WAS THE A REVENUE SOURCE FOR ANY

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:10.621
CAPITAL OVER THE LAST EIGHT

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:12.823
YEARS -- AT THE SYSTEMS WITH

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.326
EITHER EXISTING REVENUE OR OR

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.094
OTHER MONEY THAT -- COULD COME

00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:18.195
IN THE FORM OF TUITION.

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:19.330
AND I THINK THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

00:38:19.397 --> 00:38:21.098
THAT WE THINK -- IS THE PRUDENT

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.267
COURSE THE THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:24.635
THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:26.370
SYSTEM WERE BUILT BY THE ALL THE

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:28.506
TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA WE ALL

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.674
SUPPORTED THOSE.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.242
HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IT

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:33.144
WASN'T SOMETHING THAT WE SET UP

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.045
THE STUDENTS THAT GO ON THEIR

00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.113
FAMILIES HAVE THAT OBLIGATION SO

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.682
WE HAVE ALL PAID COLLECTIVELY.

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:39.517
AND THAT'S WHAT BONDS DO IS THEY

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.485
COLLECTIVELY ALL SHARE IN THOSE

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:43.587
COSTS OVER TIME OVER MANY MANY

00:38:43.654 --> 00:38:45.990
DECADES NOT JUST FUNDED IN ONE

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:46.490
SIMPLE.

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:48.559
A BUDGET -- THAT HAS AT SOME

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:49.994
SURPLUS MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THAT

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.462
CAP OF ONE TIME COSTS THESE ARE

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:52.296
SIGNIFICANT.

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:53.564
AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE

00:38:53.631 --> 00:38:55.633
BEFORE YOU A LONG TERM FUNDING

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.335
MECHANISM -- THAT HAS GRADUAL

00:38:58.402 --> 00:39:02.807
STATE FIND COSTS RATHER THAN A

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:05.209
ONE TIME WHICH COME AND GO.
