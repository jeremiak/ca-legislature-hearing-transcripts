A. O. LOUIS THOMPSON THE CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP. AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY MISTER BRIAN KELLY WILL BEGIN WITH MS KIRSTEN. MORNING HEARING MEMBERS MY NAME IS HELEN CRISTINA THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME I'M THIS MORNING WE PREPARE TO HAND OUT TO ACCOMPANY OUR REMARKS YOU SHOULD HAVE A COPY AND NOW IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. AND FOR THAT FROM HOW LONG HOME IT'S ALSO ABOUT AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE- I MEAN I THINK THE BEGINNING OF A HAND OUT- AND- TIME I KNOW WE HAVE A VERY FULL AGENDA ALSO WHICH IS A REALLY SHORT SUMMARY OF THE MAJOR FEATURES AT THE BUSINESS PLAN- TO DROP BUSINESS PLAN. NELSON RECENTLY ISSUES FACING THE LEGISLATURE THAT CONSIDERS THIS TRACK PLAN AND THE PROP ONE A. APPROPRIATION THAT'S BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE- AND FINALLY A HIGHLY DECISIONS FACING THE LEGISLATURE. ARMS IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG I'LL BEGIN ON PAGE SIX WITH JUST VERY BRIEF DISCUSSION SOME OF THE MAJOR FEATURES OF THE PLAN. OVERALL I WE NOTE THAT THE DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN IS REALLY VERY SIMILAR TO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN THAT THE LEGISLATURE SAW LAST YEAR I'M FOR EXAMPLE THE PROJECT DELIVERY PLAN IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE PLAN AND THAT WAS. THE TWENTY TWENTY PLAN I THE DRAFT PLAN CONTINUES THE AUTHORITIES APPROACH THAT WAS FIRST PRESENTED AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN I'M REALLY FOCUSING THE STATE'S EFFORTS ON CONSTRUCTION OF A SEGMENT BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD THIS INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF THE ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT BETWEEN MADERA AND CHAPTER THAT'S CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. AS WELL AS EXTENSIONS TO MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD. AND THE THIRTY PROPOSES TO LAUNCH INTERNET SERVICE ON THIS- STATEMENT HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE DECADE. ALSO TO PLAN TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE REST OF PHASE ONE AND IN THE NEAR TERM THAT MEANS COMPLETING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK FOR PHASE ONE AND THEN A DANCING DESIGN ONCE THE STATEMENTS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED. I'M STILL IN PAGE EIGHT WE HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MAJOR FEATURES RELATED TO SCHEDULE AGAIN NOT MANY CHANGES HERE AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES TO SOMETHING NEAR TERM ACTIVITIES MEADOWS HAVE BEEN DELAYED A LITTLE BIT SUCH AS THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT COMPLETION ADVOCATE OF THAT RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITIONS. AND COMPLETION OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS FOR PHASE ONE THAT I MENTIONED- HOWEVER. THE PLAN DOESN'T COMPREHENSIVELY UPDATE SCHEDULES AND IT DOESN'T WORK. FIFTY FOR BECAUSE ACTIVITY BEYOND THAT CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT. SO THE PLAN INVASION AGAIN IN TERMS. WILL BE- PERSPECTIVE. IN TWENTY TWO NINE. VALUE VALUE WILL BECOME. BY THIRTY ONE AND FACE ONE BY TWO THIRTY THREE AND THAT IT SEEMS THAT THE PRIDE- WILL HAVE FULL. I'M IF YOU TURN THE PAGE WE HAVE A THREE YEAR THE- THAT REALLY HAS. PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THE TO TWENTY TO DROP- RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY PLAN- WHICH IS REALLY TO COST PROJECT. AND EVEN HAD THE BEEN FULLY UPDATED BUT YOU NOTICE THAT THERE ARE FEW KEY. ON THAT. I'M SO OVER YOU'LL NOTICE THE DRAFT PLAN ESTIMATES THAT BUT- THE BASE COST TO FACE ONE- WILL GO OUT BY ABOUT. FOUR PER THREE BILLION RELATIVE TO THE THAT WE'RE- IN. TWO TWENTY PLAN I. SO IN. THEY ALL THERE NOW AFTER. AT BETWEEN EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN BILL EIGHTY EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. AND THAT'S REALLY IF YOU'RE BY THREE CHANGES SEE HERE THEM MOST BY TWO OF THE IN THE SOUTHERN. AREA AND THOSE ARE STATEMENTS THAT WERE RECENTLY ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEARED AND SAYS. WHAT HE'S PROPOSING ADDITIONAL AT THERE YOU CAN SEE- BAKERSFIELD TIMBER SAID AFTER TO INCREASE BY TWO. SEVEN BILLION OR ABOUT 17% AND BURBANK TO LA- BY ONE POINT SIX BILLION OR HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN PERCENT. THEY'RE ALSO VERY MINOR CHANGES- TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT COST ESTIMATE BUT- THOSE ARE REALLY. VERY MINOR- AND. AROUND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S OTHER SIGMA HAVEN'T BEEN. TO IN TERMS COST. I'M SO IT YOU TURN PAGE. ELEVEN WE HAVEN'T THING HERE. AND THIS ONE REALLY HIGHLIGHT THE PROJECTED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT AS WELL AS- THE CUSTOMER SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. ON THAT PROJECT CONTINUES TED TO IDENTIFY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. OF FINDING AN ESTIMATE THAT THOSE RESOURCES WILL BRING BETWEEN ABOUT TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS DEPENDING ON WHAT CAP AND TRADE GOT- AND HOW MUCH WE'RE IN TERMS OF REVENUE FUNCTION REVENUES IT PRODUCES- THIS IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER THAN WAS ASSUMED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS PLAN ISSUED- BASICALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THAT WE'VE HAD SOME- MORE ROBUST ON A RECENT CAP AND TRADE AUCTIONS. AND PROJECT THAT THOSE HIGHER REVENUES COULD INCREASE IT HAD A SCENARIO WHERE THOSE- THOSE CONTINUE TO TWENTY THIRTY. I'M THIRTY THREE. THAT THIS MONEY WILL BE RUN FIFTY TECH. THE COST THE WRIST TO BAKER. THANK I'M KNOW THAT THAT DOESN'T FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE REMAIN OF ONE. I'M AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THIRTEEN THAT WE IDENTIFY FOUR KEY ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION- SO FIRST WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A RECENT AGREEMENT- BUT THE AUTHORITY HAS ENTERED INTO. A REALLY COMPLICATED LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING SO SPECIFICALLY IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITY ENTERED INTO A REVISED AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL WORRY GOT GOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXCUSE ME AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT- A SIMPLIFICATION RELATED TO THE FY TEN FEDERAL GRANTS. AND UNLIKE PRIOR AGREEMENTS THAT THE THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIES ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT AS A TASK THAT WILL BE COMPLETED BUT THE GRANT FUNDS. SO BASICALLY THAT CONNECTS THE TWO ELECTRIFYING THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT UNLESS IT'S ABLE TO RENEGOTIATE THE AGREEMENT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE POTENTIALLY PUT THOSE FUNDS AT RISK. I'M WE DO KNOW IN A LIKE. ONE HUNDRED NINE MILES. I'M PROUD WOULDN'T BE WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE IS PROBABLY IMPRACTICAL TO RUN AN ELECTRIFIED SERVICE ON- AND I THINK MADE BETWEEN. AND CHAPTER I'M SO SHOULD THE AUTHORITY ELECTRIFY THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT WE THINK IT MIGHT. MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO EXTEND THAT TO MORE LOGICAL CONNECTION POINT SUCH AS MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD- AND CERTAINLY THE UTILITY OF THAT STATEMENT WOULD DEPEND A LOT ON HOW WELL. WE'RE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD ARC- THIS CONNECTIONS ARE MADE TO OTHER SERVICES- ARTIST. MAJOR ISSUE FOR A- LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION WE I DON'T. THAT EXACTLY TO US THERE'S THEY'LL BE CIVIC FUNDING TO COMPLETE PERCENT. STILL SEGMENT. PROBABLY THIS IS BECAUSE COST COULD INCREASE AND I KNOW THAT THEY CAN BE IS VERY WELL AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN A HIS ACROSS INCREASES ON ON THIS PART. AND CERTAINLY LARGE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS LIKE- THERE'S INHERENT RISK THAT COSTS WILL INCREASE ALSO BECAUSE REALLY THERE WASN'T- THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF UPDATES LAST IN TERMS THE CONSTANT AT THE COST OF MERCED TO BAKER'S. I'M CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT THOSE WERE UPDATED WE THINK THAT THEY THEY COULD WELL BE HIGHER ON AND THERE COUPLE REASONS WE THINK- WE THINK THIS COULD BE HIGHER IF THEY IF THEY WERE FULLY UPDATED- ONE OF THEM IS THAT- THEREARE YOUR STANDING IS THAT THERE ARE SOME CLAIMS THAT ARE BEING MADE BY THE CONTRACTORS ARE CURRENTLY DOING WORK ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY. I AND SOME OF THOSE KINDS COULD POTENTIALLY BE SAID. AND SO ONCE THOSE COSTS ARE FULLY. INTO THAT THE COST ESTIMATE- YOU KNOW ONCE THEY'RE STARTED. BY THICK OR ANY KIND OF. REACHES SETTLEMENT AND THERE'S A BROUGHT IN- THAT COULD CERTAINLY INCREASE COSTS OF THAT SEGMENT- AND THEREFORE THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILES ON THANK. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT EVEN JUST IN THE LAST YEAR STATE- REALLY THIS IS BEEN A UP ABOVE. EVEN THAN- DYNAMIC BUT THERE BEEN THINK BECAUSE INCREASES RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION- COST ESCALATION AND CERTAINLY WE THINK THAT COULD IT. COULD AFFECT THE COST OF THE PROJECT. YOU TO RELATE TO Y. EIGHT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THEY'LL BE SUFFICIENT FOR RESEARCH TO BAKER'S. IS THAT SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT'S PROJECTED MAY NOT MATERIALIZE. AND WE GOT THAT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE THERE'S RENOWNED COULD SCENARIO THAT ISSUE. THAT SORT OF A HIGHER AND HIGHER REVENUE FROM CAP AND TRADE THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED RECENTLY WILL CONTINUE TO TWENTY THIRTY AND WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THEY BASICALLY USE OUR OFFICES PROJECTION THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE EXPENSE. THE TWENTY THIRTY I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY- RELATED TO WHAT HAPPENED TRIANGLE DO PARTICULARLY ARE OUT INTO THE FUTURE. AND SO IT'S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT THAT- ESPECIALLY THAT HIGHER REVENUE SCENARIO- AT ME NOT TO REALIZE. I WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NO BY PLAN. WORST TO BAKER- THE OCCURRING READ ABOUT THE OF YOU SOME OTHER FUNDING INCLUDING OF THE SOME FROM THE FOR TRANSFERRED PACKAGE WHICH I THEY CAN WILL BE BACK- EXTENDING CAP AND TRADE TWENTY FIFTH SICK. SINGAPORE THAT THE THREE OF TYPICALLY GOT THE 25% I'M MORE THINKING FEDERAL FOR YOUTH THREE THE FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WOULD PROVIDE THEM. GRANT POTS THAT THE THREE COULD POTENTIALLY COMPETE FOR. HOWEVER THESE FUNDING SOURCES- REALLY ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES SO IT'S UNCLEAR- REALLY HOW MUCH THEY'LL THEY'LL BRING IN. I FOR WE IDENTIFIED THAT THE AT THE- PRETTY ACTION THANK CONSTRAIN SOME. SOME ALTERNATIVES TO THE FUTURE. THREE WE I DID THREE. ACTIONS THAT KIND OF TERM MATCH. ONE IS THAT THE PLANTS AWARD A TRACKING SYSTEMS. AND THIS WOULD BE FOR ELECTRIFIED AND NON ELECTRIFIED TRACKING SYSTEMS LATER THIS YEAR LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND SO THAT WILL FURTHER COMMIT THE STATE TO ELECTRIFICATION AND REALLY TAKING THAT APPROACH. SECOND THE AUTHORITIES PLANNING ADDITIONAL ACT- BEYOND TO BAKER THINK ADVANCE DESIGN AND THEN WHAT'S A DANCE IS. THE IT'LL START TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS LIKE- ACQUIRE PERSON AND THOSE KINDS OF STEPS WILL AGAIN I KINDA- THIS THE THIS STATE MORNING. TOWARD COMPLETING- OTHER PORTIONS THAT. ONE AND THEN THIRD- WE KNOW THAT THE AUTHORITY AND- TO SEEK SOME FEDERAL. I THINK A MENTION INCLUDING FROM A THE FEDERAL. BILL AND THERE COULD BE SOME. OF GRANTED- AND THE LEGISLATURE SURE THAT WHATEVER PROVISIONS INCLUDED THIS GRANT AGREEMENT IT'S COMFORTABLE WITH THEM IN A LINE WITH LEGISLATIVE. I DON'T WANT PAGE SEVEN. WE HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY DECISIONS THAT WE REALLY THINK THE LEGISLATURE'S KIND OF WANT TO THINK ABOUT- THIS YEAR. WE THINK A FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE REALLY FACING THE LEGISLATURE IS ITS LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO FULLY FUNDING THE PROJECT. AND THAT'S NOT JUST MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IS REALLY FUTURE PHASES AS WELL. DEPENDING ON THAT SCOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COMMITTED TO FINDING WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO TAKE DIFFERENT ACTIONS BOTH REGARDING ITS FINDINGS RESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE STATUTORY DIRECTION THAT PROVIDE- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LEGISLATURE MAKE ITS CHOICES. YOU CAN. REACH GOING TO CONTINUE GOING TO YOU KNOW TAKE SOME STEPS. THAT WILL PROBABLY. YOU KNOW ADVANCE PLAN COMPLETE- WORK AND I LIKE TO PAY WITH A BIGGER SAY AND- MAKE PROGRESS. TOWARDS THE- AND THOSE ARE ARE BECAUSE CENTERS THAT. I'M OF THE LEGISLATURE COMFORTABLE WE THE AUTHORITY APPROACH AND IT'S TO FULLY FUND NOT DISBURSING FIELD BUT ALSO ALL THE PHASE ONE WE IT MAKES SENSE TO APPROACH THE PROP ONE A. AS ITS PROPOSED AND REQUEST BY THE GUY- WE NEVER THAT THERE'S SOME RISK THAT WOULD HAVE TO PROVIDE IT JUST FUNDING TO COMPLY OR SAID TO. FEEL. BUT THERE ARE HIGHER COST OR SOME OF THE THAT CAN THINK THAT. AND ADDITIONAL WE THINK THAT THEY- I HIGHLY HAD THIS WOULD HAVE TO COME. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPLETE PHASE ONE. UNLIKELY FROM THE GENERAL. I AND IF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO PRESERVE BUT THE BILL TO PUSH OTHER. APPROACHES AND THEN THE ONE THAT. WERE INVITED TO. WE WERE THAT MAKE BUDGET. THAT PER FIFTY CONTROL THE PROJECT HE HAD THIS PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE A OF NOT THIS IS A POINT IN FIFTH CONTROL WITH THE COULD YOU. APPROPRIATION AND THIS IS TO THE LAST. THE LAST MAJOR POOR PROP ONE A. IT ALREADY PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TO COME. FOR APPROPRIATION NOT BE ABLE OF ACTUALLY. POINT SO- LEGISLATURE ME WHEN I PRESERVE THOSE AND ALSO PROVIDE- FROM STATUTORY CHANGES. THAT- THAT HELP PRESERVE ITS FOR. SO WITH HER TO THE THIS IS POINTS. I A COUPLE OF. THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER. ONE OF THEM IS STILL. I ON OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED PROPER EIGHT. AND BEEN THERE FOR WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO ASK FUNDING- PERMITTING BANDS. FOURTEEN WE IDENTIFY ABOUT. OF MODIFYING TO CONTINUE ITS APPROPRIATION PROJECT HAS SO IT'S BEEN RECEIVING. TWENTY CAP AND TRADE REVENUE- AND THOSE ARE VERY FLEXIBLE MAKING USE THEM FOR A OF DIFFERENT. 'M THE LEGISLATURE COULD MY TO THAT FOR EXAMPLE. CAP AND TRADE ON ANY BASIS- MEAN A DESIGNS IN THE CASH MONEY TO THE- AND AGAIN THE THREE WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK FOR. A REQUEST THAT WOULD GIVE LEGISLATURE NATURAL TO. IT'S CHECK A WITH THE PRIDE. AND MAKE SURE IT'S ON TRACK. I WOULD BE TO STAFF. CHIU TO PRESERVE CHOICES IDENTIFIED. OF ON. COULD CAN SAY FOR. IT COULD END UP BUDGET TRAILER LANGUAGE THAT LIMITS OR PREVENTS THE AUTHORITY EXPENDING FUNDS BEYOND WHATEVER SCOPE LEGISLATURE COMFORTABLE FINDING- EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY EXISTING FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE ENVIRONMENTAL FOR PHASE ONE TO THAT'S REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT. BUT BEYOND THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD LIMIT. THE PRETTY. I THIS WOULD BE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU GET. HAVE A TRAITS VERY FLEXIBLE THREE SPEND BETWEEN THEIR- ABOUT IT COULD THE LEGISLATURE NOT COMMITTED TO. MAKE TICKETS COMPLETING WORK BEYOND THAT YOU CAN PROTECT RESULT IN STRANDED- IF THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY DOES. FIND THE FEATURES. OR EXACT. POTENTIAL PEOPLE CUTTING DOWN- FROM CENTER. IF FUNDING THAT I'M IS CURRENTLY. FOR THAT PERCENT BIG. THING IS YOU. OTHER PARTS. I MET- AND ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE- IT'LL JUST. COULD ARBITRARILY IT WOULD LET OR PER GRANT. TO WORK. NINE IS WHATEVER THE- COMPRA. WITH SPENDING THAT WOULD BE. IN STATURE- AND WE THINK THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT AGAIN YOU'VE ALREADY HAS A HISTORY OF ENTERING INTO SOME GREAT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE CONSTRAINED LEGISLATIVE CHOICES- SO THIS WOULD HELP PRESERVE HELP. THEM PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND THOSE ARE MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WHICH- THE CORPORATE. THE YOU BEFORE WE MOVE ON MISTER TOM- I MEAN- TAKE A MOMENT TO TRIED CEMEX. HERE THIS MORNING BE. OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ALWAYS- GEN- A LOT OF QUEST. AND CALM. AND I'M SURE THAT'LL BE THE CASE TODAY WE ARE A LITTLE BIT CONSTRAINED BY THE CLOCK TODAY AND THAT- MANY OF US HAVE A- MEETING THAT WE HAVE TO ATTEND THAT- AT NOON. AND SO- I'M GOING TO- ASKED THAT WE TRY TO HOLD THE DISCUSSION ON HIGH SPEED RAIL- TO AN HOUR AND- AND TEN MINUTES AND CONCLUDED BY- ELEVEN AM WE DO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH THE AGENDA IN THAT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- AT ADDRESS ISSUES ONE THROUGH FIVE AT A MINIMUM BUT THE REMAINING ITEMS WE CAN- MOVED TO OUR MEETING BECAUSE IT'LL HAPPEN ON MARCH THIRTIETH. MORE ON MARCH THIRTIETH- SO WILL EXERCISE SOME DISCRETION THERE IF NECESSARY BUT- JUST GETTING THROUGH THESE ITEMS- ONE THROUGH FIVE AND PUBLIC COMMENT WHICH IS ALWAYS AS ROBUST AS OUR OWN DISCUSSION- IS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL- WILL PROBABLY TAKE A SAYS- WELL- AT CLOSE IF NOT TO UP TO WERE A LITTLE BIT PASSED THE NOON HOUR- THAT SAID I WANT TO WELCOME- CHAIR BOTH CHAIR TANG AND VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET- FONG- TO OUR HEARING AND TO. INVITE NOW MISTER THOMPSON. TO GIVE HIS COMMENTS. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LUKE THOMPSON I'M THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PEER REVIEW GROUP. THAT REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE UP STATUS AND REPORTS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. BYE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY- I HAVE TO SAY IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO APPEAR AFTER OF HELEN KIRSTEN BECAUSE SHE USUALLY SAYS EVERYTHING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN MORE DETAIL AND BETTER. SO IN THE INTERESTS OF TIME I'M GOING TO- TO HIT THE HIGH POINTS IN A MAXIMIZE DISCUSSION TIME. YOUR REVIEW GROUP WILL BE SUBMITTING A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY TWO PLAN SO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY TODAY ITS PRELIMINARY. OVERALL THE TWENTY TWO DRAFT PLAN DOESN'T BRING MUCH NEW INFORMATION TO THE TABLE. IT CONTAINS A CENTRALLY MOST OF THE NUMBERS AND THE FACTS AND THE THRUST OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT ARE NEW AND THEY'RE USEFUL TO RECOGNIZE FIRST. THERE IS A REAL POSSIBILITY FOR NEW FEDERAL FUNDING. THOUGH THE AMOUNTS AND THE DEGREE OF CALIFORNIANS PARTICIPATION ARE NOT YET DEFINED. WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY FOR OTHER FUNDING AND FOR EXAMPLE TO BUILD BACK BETTER BE A WHOLE. LOT IF ANY BUT IN ANY CASE NONE OF THIS WILL REFORM TO RESOLVE THE STATE'S FUNDING PROBLEMS OF THE PROJECT. THE REASON RUPE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF COVERED ON THE PROJECT AND THAT IMPACT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES ARE MOVING AHEAD THERE IS A BETTER AND MORE POSITIVE RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONNECTIVITY AND IMPACTS ON LOCAL DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S TRANSPORT NETWORK AND IT HIGHLIGHTS THE ROLE OF SUPPORTING AGENCIES NOT JUST THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IN THIS IS A POINT WE HAVE TRIED TO TOUCH ON BEFORE THAT THERE IS MORE TO THIS THAN JUST SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S ROLE. THEN THE OTHER HAS BEEN INTRODUCING BETTER MANAGEMENT. INCLUDING ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT AND STAGE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT THESE TOOLS HAVE BEEN LONG NEEDED THEY ARE TIMELY AND THEY SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON MANAGING COST CONTROLS. BUT AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT COST AND SCHEDULES THAT REMAINS IN FACT IT PROBABLY HAS EVEN INCREASED BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. FIRST THE CONSTANTS GADGIL EXPERIENCE SO FAR IS NOT ENCOURAGING. THE AVERAGE COST INCREASE ON THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ONE TWO THREE AND FOUR IS EIGHTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT. AND THE AVERAGE GRADUAL INCREASES A 118% REAL ESTATE PARCELS ARE STILL ONLY 90% THE CARD THE RIVER ROAD PARTIALS OR UTILITY PARCELS ARE ONLY 65% REQUIRED. THIS IS AFTER SIXTY NINE YEARS OF CONTRACT AWARDS. THIS EXPERIENCE DOES NOT INCLUDE CLAIMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN FILED BUT NOT YET RESOLVED AS HELEN MENTIONED AND IT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR FUTURE CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN FILED BUT MAKE WILL BE. THE PROJECT BUDGETS WERE OUT OF DATE. DASHBOARDS THAT WORD MEANT TO PROVIDE A BROAD INDICATION OF THE PROJECT STATUS OVER TIME HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE MAY OF TWENTY NINETEEN. OF THE TWO PROJECT NOTES THAT WERE UPDATED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO GRANT BUSINESS PLAN AS HELEN MENTIONED. BOB BAKER FEEL PALMDALE UP BY PERCENT 17% OF BURBANK TO LOS ANGELES UNION STATION WAS UP BY A 116% THE NEXT THOROUGH UPDATE OF COST IS NOT DUE UNTIL THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROJECT- DAY REPORTS OF THAT'LL BE SOMETHING MORE THAN A YEAR FROM NOW. THERE IS AS YET NO EXPERIENCE WITH MAJOR PROJECT COMPONENTS THAT REPRESENT MORE THAN HALF OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT THAT MEANS TIMELINE ELECTRIFICATION SIGNALLING AND ROLLING STOCK. IN THIS REGARD IT'S USEFUL TO NOTE THAT CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT IS ABOUT 25% OVER BUDGET. IN THE BART VTA EXPERIENCE WITH THESE TYPES OF COMPONENTS HAS NOT BEEN ENCOURAGING. IN ADDITION AND MAY BE OVER WRITING THAT'S THE AFTERMATH OF CODED AND POSSIBLY OF THE UKRAINE DISCREET WE DON'T KNOW THIS YET. MAY PRESAGE AND AFTER A PERIOD OF UNUSUALLY RAPID COST ESCALATION THAT COULD TAKE TIME TO WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND COULD LEAD TO FURTHER COST INCREASES. OVERALL AS I SAID THE UNCERTAINTY THAT AND THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AND IT MAY BE INCREASING. END YOUR LOWER PRIOR ISSUES AND CRITICAL ISSUES THAT REMAIN UNADDRESSED AND UNRESOLVED THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE. PRIMARY LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HAS NOT IMPROVED RELATIVE TO THE CHALLENGES AND THE EXTREME. RIDER SECOND THE FUNDING AS WE HAVE SAID MANY TIMES IS INADEQUATE AND IT'S UNSTABLE AND THAT MAKES MANAGED OF THE PROJECT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE. THIRD EVEN WITH NEW FEDERAL FUNDING THE STATE CANNOT GET OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE PROJECT CAN'T GET OUTSIDE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITHOUT ADDED STATE FUNDING FROM SOURCES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED. SO IN SUMMARY WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THIS TOGETHER WE CAN SAY THAT WE'VE COME A LONG WAY THAT THERE IS FURTHER PROGRESS IN THIS REPORT BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE PROJECT HAD IT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT'S FLOWING UNDER CONTROL. THANK YOU AND FORCE IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO DEAL WITH. THANK YOU MISTER THOMPSON- I ALWAYS APPRECIATE GETTING A REPORTS THERE ARE- A UNIFORMLY ELIMINATING CAN WILL PROCEED NOW. TO OUR- HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER BRIAN KELLY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE BRIAN KELLY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY. I APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE AUTHORITY'S DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN. I'M JOINED HERE TODAY BY MY COLLEAGUES. ARE OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER BRIAN ENNIS. THE RELEASE OF THE BUSINESS PLAN ON FEBRUARY EIGHT STARTS A SIXTY DAY REVIEW PERIOD DURING THIS TIME OUR BOARD WILL REVIEW MANAGEMENT SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS TAKE PUBLIC INPUT. AND HEAR FROM POLICY MAKERS AND CRAFT THE FINAL TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN. TO BE ADOPTED AND SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MAY FIRST OF TWENTY. BECAUSE OUR TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN WAS ADOPTED AND PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. JUST TEN MONTHS AGO MOSTLY DUE. TO THE SCHEDULE CHANGES- OF. SOLUTION WITH THE COVERT PANDEMIC. WE VIEW THE STRAP IS A BRIDGE DOCUMENT THAT ADDRESSES THREE THINGS PRIMARILY. PROVIDES UPDATES ON MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IT OUTLINES NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP A FEDERAL STATE FUNDING PROGRAM. UPDATE SOME OF THE AUTHORITIES PROJECT FORECAST INCLUDING COST UPDATES AND PREVIEWS THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY THREE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. YOUR STORY HAS BEEN MAKING PROGRESS IN THREE KEY AREAS AS LUKE THOMPSON ALLUDED TO. THESE ARE IN THE AREAS OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES RIGHT OF WAY ACQUISITIONS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DESIGN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS EXPERIENCE FROM THE READER CENTER NEARLY A 100% 71% OF THE STRUCTURES ARE IN CONSTRUCTION WORK COMPLETED NOW. 72% OF THE MILES OF GUIDEWAY ARE COMPLETED OR IN PROGRESS. RIGHT AWAY TEAM IS DELIVERED MORE THAN TWO TWO THOUSAND FIFTY PARCELS TO CONTRACTORS WHICH IS 90% OF THE TOTAL NEED. A HIGH POINT IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROP PROGRAM. REPRESENTS THIS REPRESENTS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN THE AREA THAT IS TRADITIONALLY PLAYED THE PROJECT. ENVIRONMENTALLY THE AUTHORITY IS CLEARED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES. OUT OF THE- OF THE PROGRAM IS WORKING TO CLEAR FOUR HUNDRED THIRTIES OF THE ORDER THIRTY MILES OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILE. AS ONE SYSTEM BY JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ACHIEVING THESE MILESTONES IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP FORTY STRATEGY DANCE THE ENTIRE STATEWIDE PROGRAM AND SECURE NEW FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. THERE ARE FEW UPDATES TO THE PROGRAM THAT REFLECTED IN THE DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN. SPECIFICALLY THE AUTHORITY IS PROVIDED UPDATED CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES. IS UP STATES ARE THESE UPDATES AREN'T OUTCOME OF THE AUTHORITIES EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AND STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH REFLECTING EFFORTS TO MITIGATE IMPACTS. AND WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE PROJECT CHOICE. BE CLEAR THAT THERE IS NOT A PROJECT UPDATE INCREASE BETWEEN BAKERSFIELD AND MERCED. PUBLICLY BAKER SHOW IN PALMDALE WHICH IS THE EXTENSION THAT WE DEPARTMENT CLEARED IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE JUST CLEARED THE BURBANK TO LOS ANGELES SEGMENT. GOING THROUGH THAT MANY GETTING UP SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE COMMUNITIES WITH IDENTIFIED. ACOSTA FEATURE THAT AND WE CONCLUDED THOSE IN THIS PLAN. THE THIRTY SPORT HAS THE AN UPDATE ITS PROBE TO ITS FORMAL PROGRAM BASELINE BUDGET UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATES OR DETERMINES HOW THEY WANT TO DO WITH A FOUR POINT TWO. BILLION VOTER APPROVED. OPPOSITION ONE A QUESTION OF APPROPRIATIONS WE'VE DELAYED THAT FOR TWO FOR REALLY FOR REASONS. ONE IS THE PENDING DISCUSSIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE. MAY AFFECT BOTH PROJECT SCOPE AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT AND WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE RESULTS BEFORE WE- MOVE ON WITH A FORMAL PROGRAM A BUDGET SECOND WE ARE TRACKING SYSTEMS BIDS ARE DUE IN JULY. THIRD OUR FINAL SETTLEMENT OF- CONTRACTOR COMMERCIAL ISSUES WILL RESULT A LITTLE BIT LATR THIS SPRING. AND FOURTH ARE THERE WE RIDERSHIP AND REVENUE UPDATES BECAUSE THERE'S A NEW RIDERSHIP MODEL THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. ARE WORKING WITH OUR- TRAIN OPERATOR HAS ONE WILL BE THE PUTTING THAT. USE DROPPED IT RIDERSHIP AND REVENUE. FOR THE TWENTY THREE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. SO I DO I POD THERE AND SAY THE ARE THE FOUR MAIN RE. YOU HAVE NOT UPDATED PROGRAM. BUDGET A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT USUALLY IT YEAR CYCLE BETWEEN BUSINESS PLANS. AND NOW WE ARE IN A TEN MONTH PERIOD SINCE OUR LAST BUSINESS PLAN- SO WE ARE. UNDERTAKING OF VARIOUS. YOU KNOW PUT THINGS WE DO THE JOB IN OUR COSTS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF UNANSWERED QESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED. ONE THING I JUST WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE L. A. O. PRESENTATION THAT I THINK DESERVES. UP SOME RESPONSE PROCESS THAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THE IS NOT RUNNING FORWARD AHEAD OF THE LEGISLATURE. ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING THE LEGISLATURE WITH OUR PROPOSAL. FOR HOW WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD IN A CONSTRAINED BUDGETS. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BUSINESS PLAN DOES HOWEVER. WE HAVE TO WAIT. ARE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT. AND WE HAVE T WAIT AND ARE NOT EVEN SCHEDULING. TRAIN PICTURE AT THIS POINT UNTIL WE HAVE. ALL BY. WHAT KIND OF TRACKS TO GET AWAY. WHAT KIND OF TRAINS WERE GOING TO OPERATE. AND SO WE ARE NOT. RUNNING AHEAD OF THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE- THINK NOW IS THE TIME WITH THIS BUDGET CONVERSATION. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. ASSAULT THE QUESTIONS. THAT REMAIN ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT. AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE YEAH. AND THAT WE THINK WE GET THE SIX. FOR NOW. BUT REALLY THE OF. AS I GOT MORE. SORRY THE AUTHORITIES ALL IDENTIFIED IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN. MANY FEDERAL SEVERAL MULTIPLE PARTS OF FUNDING AT FROM THE REASON PASSED BY PART BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS ROAD REPRESENT A REPLY LOVE OF INVESTOR ENTRANCE. IN THAT HAVE NOTS FOR DECADES I THINK THE TOLD FIVE YEAR AS BOB FUNDING IN THAT THERE WAS SOME HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED ABOUT SIX POTS VALUED AT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE- WE HAVE IN THE PAST WE DO NEED TO COMPETE FOR FUNDING. THIS A TREMENDOUS I FOR THE STATE TO DEVELOP A FEDERAL STATE FUNDING PROGRAM THAT WILL ENABLE US TO ACHIEVESEVERAL THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. ONE DELIVER AN ELECTRIFIED TO TRACK INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENT CONNECTING MERCED PRESIDENT BAKERSFIELD ISSUE AS POSSIBLE. STATEWIDE TO ADVANCE ENGINEERING AND DESIGN WORK IS EVERY PROJECTS SECTION IS ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAR. THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT WILL ENABLE US TO VALLEY CONFIGURE THE PROJECTS STATEWIDE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA AND ANAHEIM BUT MADE WAS TO REFINE COSTS. GET ALL THE GEO TECHNICAL WORK DONE MAP RIGHT AWAY IDENTIFIED LECTURED LECTUED UTILITIES TO BE MOVED AND YOU'LL GET PREPARED TO DO ALL THE NECESSARY PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK BEFORE WE GET INTO CONSTRUCTION. THOSE STEPS WERE MISSING IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT MISTAKE GOING FORWARD. SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE- THAT'S- THE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ARE TO DEVELOP- THE OTHER A- WITH THE FUNNY IS TO IT. IN JERICHO IN THE AREA SUCH AS THE CALTRAIN PROJECT OF THE LOS ANGELES BASIN SUCH AT THE LINK U. S. R. PROJECT OR PERHAPS EARLY GRADE SEPARATIONS THAT CAN BE DONE DOWN THERE. DEVELOP A SINGLE STATION IN DOWNTOWN MERCED SO THAT INSTEAD OF. YOU KNOW A TRAIN OPERATORS GOING TO TWO SEPARATE STATIONS THEY'RE GOING TO WANT. AND ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY ESPECIALLY AS CONGRESS CONTEMPLATES THE FINALITY OF THE BILL BACK BETTER BILL. CRAFTED PETS WALKER TRANSPORTING STRATEGY TO EXPAND EXTEND HIGH SPEED RAIL FROM CENTRALLY BUDGET. IS POSSIBLE. YEAH BUT ABOVE ALSO I AND CON THAT ARE BY. THIS PRESENTS AN- TO CLOSE THE DIVIDE. AND AGREE ON INVESTMENTS THAT ALLOW STATEWIDE HIGH SPEED RAIL THE REPORT ALONG HIGH PRIORITY REGIONAL PROJECTS. FINALLY THE AUTHORITY ANTICIPATES COMING BACK NEXT YEAR WITH THIS PROJECT UPDATE REPORT THE PROVIDE MORE CLARITY ON SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES. THAT WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH AND NEED DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE ON. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. SPECIFICALLY OUTLINING A FUNDING STRATEGY THAT WILL BE INFORMED BY LEGISLATIVE BUDGET DECISIONS. AND POTENTIALLY FEDERAL ACTION ON ADDITIONAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE A BILL BACK BETTER BILL. ALSO EXPECTED WILL BE AN UPDATED PROGRAM BASELINE BUDGET SCHEDULE INFORMED BY FUNDING COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS TRACKING SYSTEMS BEDS. AND STATION DESIGNS WERE MERCED BIGGEST ON. WITH FEDERAL STATE- OFFENDING THAT IS AT A LEVEL THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE. AND WHAT WE'RE HOPEFUL OF IS THAT WE CAN ADVANCE A PROGRAM WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO THIS BUDGET CYCLE. TO ALLOW US TO ADVANCE OUR PROGRAM AS WE HAVE PROPOSED SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND TO ALSO MAKE IMPORTANT INVESTMENTS IN STATEWIDE REGIONAL PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT IS A QUICK THUMBNAIL SUMMARY WHAT'S IN BUSINESS PLAN WITH THAT I'M- QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A MISTER CALLIE- WILL PROCEED NOW WITH- I HAVE QUESTIONS- I'LL KICK IT OFF- FOLLOWED BY. A MEMBERS FRIEDMAN TANG AND FONG AND THEN THE OLD LET ME KNOW- AS YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS PLEASE AGAIN WITH THE GOAL TOWARDS THE CONCLUDING THIS PART OF OUR HEARING AT ELEVEN AM- SO- A MISTER KELLY. I THINK- VERY SIMILAR TO LAST YEAR WE'RE FINDING OURSELVES AT A CROSSROAD ABOUT HOW TO MOVE THE PROJECT FORWARD IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER IN THE L. A. L. IS OUT THE CENTRAL QUESTION. TO THE CONVERSATION AND THAT IS WHAT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO MAKE. TO FULLY FUND THE PROJECT NOT JUST THE- HUNDRED NINETEEN MILES BUT THE FUTURE SEGMENTS AS WELL. BUT TO GET TO THAT ANSWER- WE NEED QUESTIONS ANSWERED. THAT WERE ASKED LAST YEAR BUT- AT LEAST A TO MY KNOWLEDGE REMAIN UNANSWERED WITH THE DRAFT TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN. THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN DIFFERS A BASELINE OF THE PROGRAM BUDGET UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT INFLATION DELAYS AND THE CURRENT COST OF MATERIALS. MUST IMPACT THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT. CAN THE AUTHORITY EXPLAINED WHY THESE WERE NOT EVALUATED AS PART OF THE- TWENTY TWO BUSINESS PLAN. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE ANSWER IS MOSTLY BECAUSE THEY WERE THEY WERE EVALUATED IN THE PLAN THAT WE RELEASED JUST TEN MONTHS AGO. AND WE HAVE NOT MADE. OF UPDATES TO THOSE AT THIS POINT WITH RESPECT TO THE INFLATION THAT'S A PART OF THE- CONSUMER. PRICE INDEX FOR THE OTHER ELEMNTS. WE CONDUCT A REVIEW OF OUR PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION ESCALATION RATES IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. AND COMPARE THAT TO THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS ESCALATION MANUAL WHICH IS CALLED THE CIVIL WORKS CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX SYSTEM. RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE TWENTY TWO ESCALATION RATES ARE WITHIN THE RANGES AS COMPARED TO THE LONG TERM- LET'S WORK WILL PERFORMANCE OF THE INDEX. AND SO WE'RE NOT MAKING AN ADJUSTMENT AT THIS TIME WE NOTE. THAT THE INFLATION BLIP HERE IS AT THIS TIME. UP A POINT IN TIME- EVENT ESCALATION RATES COVER MULTIPLE YEARS. AGO FOR. A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND WATCH. A THAT IT WILL MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT AT THIS POINT BSED ON THE METRIC WE USE. WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT THAT'S- AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE ADOPTION OF OUR FORMAL BUDGET WHICH IS INTERNALLY HERE AT THE OR- WE DID OUR BOARD DID APPROVED AUTHORIZED EXPENDITURE THAT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE BUDGET THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THAT TOOK INTO ACCOUNT. CHANGES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THAT PLAN. THAT WE'RE COST ESTIMATES BASED ON OUR INCREASES IN THIS VALLEY MOSTLY TIED TO. OUR SCOPE STILL GETTING IN THAT A CONTRACT FROM. DECISIONS WELL BEFORE I ARRIVED HERE- HOWEVER WE ARE FINALIZING THAT WORK NOW- BUT THE ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK. IN THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS WE MADE A WE ESTIMATE WILL BE SUFFICIENT. TO COVER WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WHAT WE NOW KNOW WAS ARE NO COST ESTIMATES IN THAT REGARD. SO AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE WORK THROUGH- CONTINUES COPIOUS USE ON THIS PROGRAM WE WILL UPDATE AGAIN. AND WE WILL DO. AS SOON AS WE COMPLETE SOME OF OUR COMMERCIAL. THAT EXHAUSTION. AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE- OF. NUMBERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ARE BASED ON. TWENTY NINETEEN- INFORMATION IS THAT CORRECT. THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE ESTIMATES THAT THAT WE PUT IN PLACE JUST BEFORE WE RELEASE THE PLAN AND THE PLAN WAS RELEASED IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ADOPTED IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE UP TO UPDATE THEM AS BEST WE CAN ALL THE WAY UNTIL THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL PLAN- AND SO THAT IS THOSE EXCLUDED ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHERE WE IDENTIFIED. ACOSTA MIGHT MOVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THAT PLAN WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION IN COSTS THAT WOULD GO UP WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY BASED ON- COMMERCIAL DISPUTES AND CHANGE ORDERS THAT WE- WERE NOT. INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR A PROGRAM THAT WE DON'T NEED TO BE INCLUDED AND SO WE ADJUSTED THE BUDGET AT THAT TIME WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED NEW OR ADDITIONAL ONES AT THIS POIT- TO ADD TO THAT BUDGET. AND SO ARE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN BUDGET WHICH REALLY ARE BOARD DID NOT INCORPORATE UNTIL DECEMBER OF TWENTY ONE JUST TWO MONTHS AGO INCORPORATES OUR ESTIMATE OF COSTS FOR THAT SECTOR AND THE WOULD THAT INCLUDE THE COST FOR CHANGE. ORDERS- THAT WERE. YEAH YOU WITH WE WILL AWARE OF WE ESTIMATED IN THAT PROGRAM WHAT WE CALLED ARE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN COSTS AND WE DID THAT BY. CUTTING DOWN COSTS IN THE SPECIFIC BUDGETS OF EACH OF OUR CONSTRUCTION PACKAGES. AND THAT WE INCLUDED A CONTINGENCY INCREASE FOR EACH OF THOSE PROTOCOLS ARE UNDER BECAUSE WE ARE IN COMMERCIAL DISPUTE OR COMMERCIAL SETTLEMENT ISSUES WHICH YOU CONTRACTORS NOW. AND AS THOSE RESOLVE IF THERE'S ANY ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE WILL INDICATE THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WILL INDICATE THAT TO MY BOARD PUBLIC WITH. ADS BUT AT THIS POINT BUT WE HAVE NOT MOVED OFF THE ESTIMATES THAT WE PUT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY. THIS IS. THANK YOU AB. A FOR THE- IS- CHRISTINE. OF WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE FOR OVERSIGHT ON THE PROJECT CAN YOU- REVIEW THOSE AGAIN FOR US AND ALSO- INCLUDING REMARKS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOTHING. SURE THANK YOU AND JUST NINE ON MR KELLY'S POINT I BELIEVE IT WHAT I BELIEVE THAT EVEN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN DIDN'T FULLY AT THE ALL THE COST FOR THE WHOLE OF THESE ONES THAT SOME OF THAT SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BECAUSE THEY REALLY HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY UPDATED SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN SO I THINK THAT- THAT THAT'S- THAT THAT IS STILL AT AN IMPORTANT POINT. AND THEY TRY TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION- BUT YES I AM THANK YOU SO MUCH ON YOUR ON YOUR POINT ABOUT- WE'RE SORRY I THINK IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT WE PROVIDE YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS- I THINK WHAT IS. REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS- YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE HAVING A LITTLE BIT MORE CONTROL AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROJECT AND PART OF THAT IS THESE NATURAL DECISION POINTS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE- I'M PART OF YOU KNOW THIS THIS PROJECT- AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO CORPORATION BECAUSE THEY GET THESE BIG. YOU KNOW BUCKET THE PROP ONE A. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BASICALLY BE DEMOCRATS TWENTY NOW- AND THAT BECAUSE HE WAS A PREPARATION JUST KIND OF COMES IN ON THE NATURAL THE LEGISLATURE ISN'T- IT REQUIRED- YOUR DOES IT DOESN'T HAVE YOU KNOW THAT HAVE TO MAKE IT APPROPRIATIONS AND ANNUAL BASIS- AND ALSO BECAUSE THE AUTHORITY. IS REALLY GOVERNED BY A BOARD AND THE BOARD CAN MAKE A LOT OF CHOICES THAT ARE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE LEGISLATIVE IT IF WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT YOU KNOW WHAT DINNER TO GRANT AGREEMENT WANTS TO INTERFERE WANTS TO MAKE OTHER CHOICES TO BEFORE THE PROJECT- SO THIS PROJECT THIS PROJECT CAN REALLY KIND OF- GO ALONG ON ITS OWN WITHOUT. A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE CONTROL AND LET THE LEGISLATIVE LATE LEGISLATURE SHOULD EXERT ITSELF I'M THIRTY THINK ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO BE NATIONAL DECISION POINT THE BUDGET PROCESS AGAIN I'M MAKING YOU KNOW MAKING SOME OPPORTUNITIES WITH ALLEGED WHERE THAT ALREADY HAS TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO ASK FOR FUNDING. AND GET THE LEGISLATURE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY COME MAKE THANK YOU KNOW COSTS GO UP NEXT YEAR WE SEE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE PROJECT UPDATE REPORT LEGISLATURE CAN REVIEW THOSE COSTS CAN. ASK THOSE QUESTIONS AND MAKE THOSE DECISIONS SO WE THINK THAT- ONE OPTION. CERTAINLY ALSO PROVIDING MORE STATUTORY DIRECTION RIGHT NOW THE CABIN. FUNDS THEY MENTION ARE RE. FIVE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY JUST KIND GIVE INTO THE AUTHORITY FOR THE PER. THOSE COULD BE USED YOU KNOW. I ON THE ALIGNMENT FOR- AND- THAT COULD BE A- AT THE- CONSISTENT LEGISLATIVE. BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS. MORE DIRECTION ABOUT HOW IT WANTS THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED OR THE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS THEY WANT THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO- WE THINK IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO- YOU KNOW TO. PROVIDE THAT STATUTORY DIRECTION THAT WOULD FURTHER- FOR DIRECTING IT TOWARD THE END AND REALLY MAKE SURE IT'S CLEARLY. TO THE AUTHORITY- MISTER WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S- YOU ARE. PREFERRED APPROACH IT IS- THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT RECENTLY- AS AN OFFICE BUT- I KNOW OUR OFFICE BROUGHT UP. SEVERAL YEARS AGO FOR EXAMPLE AND BACK WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IT FEELS LIKE A ALMOST A DIFFERENT WORLD A LOT OF THE PRAHLAD OF THE ISSUES FACING THE PROJECT. ARE STILL SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES- THAT WE WERE TACKLING YOUR TEN YEARS AGO SOME ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE FROM THE LEGISLATURE. PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE BOARD HAVING A LOT OF. SORT OF ACT. YEAH A LOT OF MATURITY AND- AND SOMETIMES IT BEING HARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE OVERSIGHT TO THAT PROCESS. TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT REPORT ABOUT SOME DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW YOU'RE MODIFYING THE BOARD- SO THERE ARE A LOT OF CHOICES YOU% COULD ALSO HAVE SOME SORT OF SEPARATE COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE I KNOW IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT- BY FOLKS YOU KNOW THAT BUT LOOK AT CHANGE ORDERS OR SOME KIND OF OUTSIDE GROUP THAT LOOKS. THAT LOOKS AT THE AUTHORITY- OR THAT COULD DO YOU I'VE EVER VICE COST ESTIMATE FOR EXAMPLE THAT'S AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT- YOU RIGHT NOW THAT THE AUTHORITY IS. IT DOES IT DOES YOU KNOW. CONTACT WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTORS TO DO- RIDERSHIP AND COST ESTIMATES BUT- YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPTION AS WELL. YOU KNOW. SHOULD THIRD PARTY B. B- HE INVOLVED IN SOME OF THOSE. THAT THEY'RE A WHOLE. OF OCT. THAT I KNOW- HAVE BEEN THE- OVER OVER THE YEARS- WITH THIS PROJECT- THEY'RE PROBABLY. YOU KNOW A NUMBER IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER. AGAIN YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF OUR REMARKS TODAY WE REALLY FOCUSED ON A FEW- A FEW RELATED TO THIS DECISION POINTS AND PROVIDING THAT STATUTORY DIRECTION BUT- BUT THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IF THE LEGISLATURE- IS INTERESTED IN. AND FURTHER PURSUING ANY OF THOSE- THOSE POSSIBILITIES. THANKS VERY MUCH MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND- SPENDING TIME WITH US THIS MORNING- YOU KNOW I. STILL BUY INTO THE DREAM OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. I STILL THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT VISION FOR- FOR TRANSPORTATION IN THE FUTURE AND SOMETHING THAT COULD BE HUGELY BENEFICIAL TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS A GROSS. AS WELL. BUT I ALSO REMAIN CONCERNED- ABOUT THE PROJECT- GIVEN. ALL OF THE- ISSUES THAT IT HAS WITH FUNDING AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY'S FAULT- BUT THE PROJECT IS UNDERFUNDED FOR WHAT IT NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED. HOW MUCH IS UNCLEAR YOU KNOW WE HEAR DIFFERENT NUMBERS FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS- WE HEARD TODAY FROM MISTER THOMPSON CONCERNED ABOUT. THE COST CONTINUING TO ESCALATE BEYOND WHAT WE SEE IN THIS- DRAFT A BUSINESS PLAN. AND WE ARE IN AN UNKNOWN OF A POSITION IN TERMS OF FEDERAL FUNDING AND WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE ATTAINABLE. AND AT SOME POINT. IN THE EGISLATURE OR THE VOTERS ARE BOTH ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ALLOCATE QUITE A BIT OF MONEY TO FINISH THIS PROJECT. AND MY- REASON FOR QUESTIONING THE BUSINESS PLANET EVERY POINT THAT WE CAN IS BECAUSE WE HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE POINT WHICH IS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE VOTERS ARE BOTH. ARE ASKED TO GIVE ALLOCATE A LOT OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO THIS PROJECT. IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE BEST SHAPE IT CAN BE IT NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS SHOWING THE PROMISE OF WHAT HIGH SPEED RAIL COULD MEAN FOR THESE REGIONS. I REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT. FOCUSING ON BUYING TRAINS AND RUNNING TRACK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILES RUNNING THROUGH HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED TRAIN FOR A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WHICH IS NOT AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF DISTANCE TO SHOW THE PROMISE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND IN THIS CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AS FAR AS I CAN SEE WE'RE NOT RUNNING IT INTO OUR POPULATION CENTERS TO DEVELOP THE KIND OF RIDERSHIP THAT A SUCCESSFUL SYSTEM WOULD DO. SO I. CONTINUE TO THINK THAT WE SHOULD. LOOK AT ALTERNATIVES AT LEAST HAVE. AT THE POINT AT WHICH THE BOND MONEY IS FINISHED. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING BACK TO LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LARGE. POT OF MONEY. THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT HAS AS MUCH UTILITY. FOR ACTUAL WRITERS AS POSSIBLE. IF THERE ARE PEOPLE RIDING THE SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IT. IF IT IS A TRAIN THAT'S FAST RUNNING BACK AND FORTH. WITHOUT A LOT OF WRITERS I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN NAY SAYERS AND MAYBE EVEN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORT BY HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT THE PROJECT. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ABILITY IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO IMPACT THIS PROJECT EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO US FOR FUNDING THAT'S OUR ONLY OPPORTUNITY IS THE ALEJO'S JUST SAID. WE NEED TO USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE DO IT. WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE BUT PLAN THAT WE CAN. SO WHEN I WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS IT'S NOT AN ATTACK ON ANYONE IN PARTICULAR I THINK THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. HAS BEEN GIVEN A DIFFICULT TASK. OF A PROJECT THAT IN SOME WAYS IS UNDERFUNDED. AND HAS A LOT OF EXPECTATIONS. AND OF COURSE THEY'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO GET AS MUCH BUILT AS THEY CAN WITHIN THEIR ORIGINAL MANDATE- BUT IT'S ALSO VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE EVEN HAVE WHEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS PROJECT EVEN TO FINISH MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST. THERE ARE STILL SEGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PURCHASED WERE HEARING. A DIFFERENT ANALYSIS FOR MISTER THOMPSON FROM THE INDEPENDENT PEER REVIEW GROUP ABOUT COST THE MORE HEARING THAT WE'RE SEEING REFLECTED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN- I WANTED TO ASK. ALL THREE. AND I'M SORRY BUT AT TEN THIRTY I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAVE FOR A FEW MINUTES- AMONG THE URBAN SCHEDULE PREVIOUSLY AND I'LL COME BACK AND I'VE ASKED MY STAFF TO BOOK MARKING TAPE EVERYTHING SO I CAN HEAR ALL THE ANSWERS. BUT I THINK MAYBE IF I CAN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. AND THAT WAY IF I NEED TO LEAVE THEIR OF THEIR ASSETS. I WANTED TO KNOW YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD SOME DIFFERENT- SUGGESTIONS ABOUT SPENDING MONEY. IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE ON CALTRAIN OR ON- YOU KNOW LACE ISN'T IN LOS ANGELES. AND YET WE HEAR THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE WITHIN WHAT WE HAVE. TO FINISH MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD SO I WANTED TO ASK ALL THREE. ABOUT THE OPTION OF NOT SPENDING ANY MONEY OUTSIDE OF THE MERCED BAKERSFIELD- PROJECT AREA INTO AND- UNTIL WE'VE COMPLETED THAT. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE WISDOM OF ACTUALLY ENTERING INTO TRACKING SYSTEM CONTRACTS AND ESSENTIALLY BUYING TRAINS. BEFORE WE'VE HAD THE MONEY TO CONNECT OUR SYSTEM TO ANY POPULATION CENTER. AND WHY THE RUSH TO DO THAT. INSTEAD OF PUTTING ALL THE MONEY THAT WE CAN'T INTO DOING A TWO TRACK SYSTEM WE STILL HAVE A ONE TRACK SYSTEM IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN BY THE WAY. ONE TRACK WITH TRAINS HAVING TO PULL OVER TO PASS EACH OTHER. SUBOPTIMAL FOR SURE- AND- I ALSO WANTED TO ASK MR KELLY ABOUT THAT CONNECTION. TO A STRAIN OR TO OTHER ANOTHER TRAIN SYSTEM. I'M STILL VERY UNCLEAR ON THIS BUSINESS PLAN ABOUT WHERE THIS TRAIN WHERE THE STATION IS GOING TO BE. AND WHO PAYS FOR CONNECTION. AS FAR AS I CAN SEE IF THE TRAIN STOPS IN MERCED AT A STATION THAT'S TO BE BUILT BUT THERE'S NO CONNECTION TO ANY OTHER TRAIN SYSTEM. AND HOW LONG IT'S SUPPOSED TO OPERATE. FROM OUTSIDE OF BAKERSFIELD NOT EVEN INTO DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD BUT OUTSIDE OF BAKERSFIELD. TO A STATION NUMBER SAID WITH NO CONNECTION TO ANYTHING ELSE. AND WHAT ARE THEIR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO PRESENT AS REFLECTED THAT REALITY. BECAUSE THEN WE'RE WAITING TO TRY TO FIND MORE FUNDING TO CONNECT THIS TRYING TO SOMETHING. AND I BELIEVE THAT TO HAS WOULD HAVE UTILITY THIS TRAIN HAS TO GO. BEYOND MERCED. THEY WON WHEN IT OPENS NOT DOWN THE LINE NOT IN FIVE YEARS NOT IN TEN YEARS. SO MY CONCERN ABOUT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS MORE THAN ANYTHING ON THAT CONNECTION SO THAT WHATEVER IS RUNNING ON THIS BEAUTIFUL NEW SECTION O TRACK SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY'RE WORKING. OVER THEY WANT TO GO. NOT TO GET ON A BUS AND TRAVEL ANOTHER FEW MILES TO ANOTHER TRAIN SYSTEM. THAT MAYBE HAS SERVICE THAT DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH THIS TRAIN SERVICE BUT SOMETHING THAT. REALLY HAS UTILITY. AND THAT ALL OF OUR FUNDING SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON COMPLETING THAT SECTION OF TRACK WITH TWO TWO TRACKS. MY LAST QUESTION WILL BE ABOUT THE ELECTRIFICATION IN THE AND THAT'S NOW SOMEHOW FOUND ITS WAY INTO THIS FEDERAL APPROPRIATION COURSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUN HIGH SPEED RAIL WITHOUT BEING ELECTRIFIED THAT'S OBVIOUS BUT BUT MY QUESTION IS IF WE DO THE PRELIMINARY WORK. TO ELECTRIFY THE TRACK BUT NOT COMPLETE THAT UNTIL WE'VE ACTUALLY BOUGHT OUR TRAINS INCLUDED OUR SYSTEM. DOES THAT SORT OF COUNT WITHIN THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN OTHER WORDS. CAN WE TO START THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUT STILL RUN SOMETHING IN TERM ON THAT TRACK- INTO WE COMPLETE OUR SYSTEM OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE TO DO. EVERYTHING EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO RUN A TRAIN OR CONNECT TO ANYTHING SO. I'LL WAIT IN HERE AND I'M SORRY IF I HAVE TO GO OUT AND COME BACK BUT- AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO HEAR FROM MR THOMPSON WHO IS OUR INDEPENDENT- A SORT OF ANALYST IN ALL OF THIS- I'D LIKE TO HEAR IF HE HAS ANY- ANSWERS TO ANY OF THESE AS WELL. THANK YOU. HELLO ASK- THAT- ALL OF OUR PANELISTS KEEP YOUR ANSWERS AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS TO US THIS MORNING. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SORRY WHO DID YOU WANT TO GO FIRST. IF YOU MISTER TOM. MISTER THOMPSON. THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS WHICH I WILL HAVE TO SAY ARE NOT EASY- THEY REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT OF THOUGHT FIRST I THINK MY REACTION IS THAT WHAT YOUR QUESTION DOES IS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT IT WANTS. ARE YOU DO NOT IN THIS CASE WANT TO DILUTE THE EFFORT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IF THEY'RE GOING TO DO. A MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY MONEY TO TALK ABOUT SHIFTING OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IT SHOULD REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE OBJECTIVE OF MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD. ALL WE ALL CONNECTION AT MERCED THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT WAS ISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR LETTER LAST YEAR AND IT REMAINS A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN. IT INVOLVES STATE MINING AND STATE COMMITMENT TO FINISHING YOUR CONNECTION SAID AND LOCAL COMMITMENT FROM THE US AND GENERAL KEANE JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. BOOSTER PLAN OPERATE THAT STATION OPERATE THE CONNECTING SERVICES AND UNDER THE PLANS OF THE AUTHORITY. ACTUALLY OPERATE UNDER CONTRACT HI SPEED TRAINS FROM MERCED THAT BAKERSFIELD. AND THOSE ARE ISSUES WHICH WE SAID THEN- NEED DID A LOT FOR THE RETENTION OF CLARIFICATION THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE SO IT'S A- DESERVES. SOME AND ALL THAT ALL RIGHT SOME ATTENTION ON THAT. I GUESS FINAL ELECTRIFICATION A ROLE IN THIS OFF TO A BRAND OR ALONE BUT- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TERMS OF THE OF THE FEDERAL. REQUIREMENT FOR ELECTRIFICATION OF MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD ART. AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT OBJECTIVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS TRYING TO SOLICIT SATISFIED BY REQUIRING ELECTRIFICATION. AS AS PART OF AN AGREEMENT- INDEED YOU COULD OPERATE HI SPEED DIESEL TRAINS. ON THE SEGMENT FOR SOME INTERIM PERIOD OF TIME. AND THAT WOULD HAVE HOW DO BECAUSE THEY TO CONNECT DIRECTLY TO SACRAMENTO IF YOU WANTED TO DO SO WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CHANGE IN OUR SET. UP WITH THE SUIT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY INSIST ON ALECTRA EDUCATION BEFORE COMPLETION OF EVERYTHING ELSE I DON'T KNOW. THAT WOULD BE A MATTER FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE BIDEN MINISTRATION BUT- MY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR IS THAT THEY'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE STATE FOR ANYTHING. THAT THE STATE WANTS TO DO. WHICH INCLUDES BACK TO THE QUESTION WHAT THE ALLIANCE. REALLY WANT THE SPEED RAIL OF THE- TO DO. I DO WANT TO ADD ONE OTHER THING- THAT THEY WE CAN THE SIZE DATA IS THAT. TO PUT ONE IS. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT COULD INCLUDE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT FELL AND HAS MENTIONED- BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE AS OF NOW LOOKS AT THE PROJECT ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCED IN THE PROJECT WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD YEARS OF. CONTINUITY IN OVERSEEING ISSUES OF THE PROJECT AND WITHOUT PEOPLE WHO ARE FOCUSED ON THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE IS EVER UNDERTAKEN THAT DESERVES SOME THOUGHT. WELL I GUESS THE OTHER THOUGHT IS THAT. HELP STABLE INADEQUATE FUNDING FROM WHATEVER SOURCES THE LEGISLATURE DESIGNATES WITHOUT STABLE AND ADEQUATE FUNDING YOU'RE ASKING BRIAN KELLY TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE CAN'T DO. HE'S GOT TO HE HAS TO JUGGLE TOO MANY THINGS AND HE HAS TOO MANY THINGS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN DEPEND ON. SO AT SOME POINT PART OF THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION ON THIS PROJECT HAS GOT TO BE TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR SET OF OBJECTIVES AND FUNDING THAT IS ADEQUATE AND STABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES UNTIL YOU DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE HAVING THE SAME KIND OF ISSUES EVERY YEAR. OF THAT AS HELEN SAID THAT WE'VE OF THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS PROJECT SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE AND I HANG OUT. THESE ISSUES HAVE COME UP NEARLY EVERY YEAR AND I REALLY NEED TO BE RESOLVED. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAY I. OKAY SO ON THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS- FIRST WITH RESPECT TO THE SUGGESTION THAT WE'RE SPENDING MONEY ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE THE VALLEY OF LUCK WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUDGET THAT WE ESTIMATE WE HAVE BETWEEN BOND DOLLARS. THE AVAILABLE FEDERAL DOLLARS WE ALREADY HAVE NOT NEW BUT THE AVAILABLE DATA DOLLARS WE ALREADY HAVE AND THE CAP AND TRADE MONEY THAT WE ESTIMATE WE HAVE BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS OUTSIDE OF THE VALLEY. WHAT WE ARE OBSERVING IS THAT WE'RE AT A TIME A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE NEW FEDERAL DOLLARS HAVE COME IN AT A LEVEL OF INVESTMENT HIGHER THAN WE'VE SEEN IN DECADES. THE GOVERNOR HAS ADDED A FOURTEEN POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENT PROGRAM. INTO THAT FEDERAL POT RIGHT NOW. AND SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS HERE FOR US TO PURSUE FEDERAL MONEY. TO ELIMINATE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SINGLE TRACK BETWEEN MERCED AND BAKERSFIELD AND DO A DOUBLE TRACK. AND TO USE OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS TO ADVANCE WORK AROUND THE STATE THAT SOME HAVE ADVOCATED WE DO. I'M THROUGH WITH THOSE DOLLARS TO ADVANCED DESIGN WORK WHERE WE FINISH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. WE ARE WORKING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS STATEWIDE- FIVE HUNDRED MILE SEGMENT. AT FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE I GOT HERE THORNY HAD NOT CLEARED THE RECORD OF DECISION. WE'VE NOW DONE FOR IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND WILL DO TO MORE IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THAT'S SIX SEGMENTS CLEAR ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY MILES OF THE FIVE MILE SYSTEM WE ARE. WE THINK IT IS WISE TO ADVANCE THE COULD THE DESIGN WORK IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT IN THE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS THIS YEAR. THEY'LL BE SOME MONEY IDENTIFIED FOR THAT PURPOSE BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ADVOCATED FOR BY SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WE SUPPORT THAT. I DON'T HAVE IT WITHIN MY CURRENT BUDGET TO DO IT BUT I DO SUPPORT USING ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ADVANCED DESIGN WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NO QUESTION ABOUT. SECONDLY ON THE WISDOM OF RUSHING FOR TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT. OR BUYING TRAINS. FAR FROM RUSHING WE ARE DELAY. WE ARE DELAYING THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT WE HAVE DONE IT SEVERAL TIMES. AND WE ARE NOT EVEN CONSIDERING BUYING TRAINS IN THIS FISCAL YEAR UNTIL. THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE IS SUBTLE. OUR HOPE IS THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS YEAR. WE WILL COME OUT OF THIS WITH THE CLARITY. ON HOW POLICY MAKERS WANT TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROJECT. AND THEN WE WILL REACT TO THAT. AND WE WILL DETERMINE TOGETHER HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. ARE WE WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE LAW THIS BUSINESS PLAN. IS TELL YOU HOW WE WOULD MOVE FORWARD UNDER A CONSTRAINT BUDGETS. AND ARE CONSTRAINED BUDGET IS ABOUT TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE BILLION. BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRD. THAT'S CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS THE REMAINING BOND FUNDS. AT THE FEDERAL FUNDING WE ALREADY HAVE. NOT NEW FEDERAL FOR. NEW FEDERAL FUNDING WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THAT. SO WE ARE YOU INTEND TO PURSUE NEW FEDERAL DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BEST WORKING RELATIONSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH THE US DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION AND THE UP ALREADY IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT. WE THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO GO SETTLE ISSUES LIKE ONE TRACK VERSUS TO TRACK. THE OTHER THING I JUST MENTION THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT BILL. BECAUSE IT NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED AND YOU NEED TO MOVE. TO AUTOMATE CONSTRUCTION AS WE COMPLETE THE CIVIL WORKS. THE C. P. FOR CONTRACT WILL BE DONE. AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND SO. THE DESIGN AND THE EARLY PROCUREMENT OF MATERIALS WILL BE NECESSARY TO AUTOMATICALLY EXECUTE TRACKING SYSTEMS HOWEVER. IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE BUILDING ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM OR NOT. THEN WE SHOULD WAIT. WE SHOULD WAIT OUR VIEW IS FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE SHOULD HAVE AN ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM. WE DID A ALL SIDE BY SIDE ANALYSIS OF THIS IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE REPEATED IT IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SHARED IT WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE CHATTED WITH PEER REVIEW GROUPS. THE PEER EVIEW GROUP THAT WE SHARED IT WITH SAID IT WAS REASONABLE THAT WE THINK THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH FOR CONSTRAINED BUDGET. THAT ALSO IS IN LINE WITH WHAT PROP ONE A. **** TO DO. SO WE WANT TO GET AN OPERATING SEGMENT GOING ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED TRAINS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF BENEFIT FROM DOING THAT FROM RIDERSHIP PERSPECTIVE IN THE BALLOT. AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK EVERYWHERE ELSE SO WE CAN PREPARE THE NEW SEGMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION. AND MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT UNLIKE THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROJECT ON THE BALLOT. WE WANT TO GET MORE RISK THE NO EARLIER WE WANT TO IDENTIFY THE DID THE WHAT EXPAND DESIGN IDENTIFY THE RIGHT AWAY THAT'S NEEDED. WE'RE NOT GOING TO UNDERTAKE THAT WORK UNTIL WE'VE MOVED THE WORK IN THE VALLEY WE'VE GOT A PERCENT BAKERSFIELD STRETCH OPERATIONAL OR GOING WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT AS A STATE. AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET HOW TO ADVANCE THE WORK BE ON THE BALLOT AND YES IT WILL TAKE ORE MONEY AND IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW I. COME UP WITH A BUSINESS PLAN EVERY YEAR. AND I CAN. THE I DO HAVE FUND. FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE VALLEY RIGHT NOW. I DO NOT HAVE DENTIFIED FUNDING AND THAT'S WHAT LIEU THOMPSON IS THAT SAYING FOR FIVE YEARS MAYBE LONGER AND SO I'M GIVING YOU A PLAN OF HOW WE CAN DO THIS WITHIN OUR TRAIN BUDGET SEGMENT BY SEGMENT ARAFAT IS USE THE ASSETS WERE BUILDING NOW GET THE ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM GOING THERE THERE ARE RIDERSHIP BENEFITS TRAVEL BENEFITS CONNECTIVITY BENEFITS GREENHOUSE GAS BENEFITS. WE LAID ALL THOSE OUT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY WE SUBJECTED TO PEER REVIEW AND IT WAS A FIRM. AND SO THAT IS OUR PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD IF THE LEGISLATURE POLICY MAKERS WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE WE'LL DO SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THAT THAT IS WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PUT IN A PLAN HERE IS HOW WE WOULD PROCEED I DO NOT HAVE MONEY YOU HAVE TO GET TO THE BAY AREA OR INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT WE CAN ADVANCE THOSE SECTIONS BY GETTING ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE. AND DOING ALL OF THE ADVANCED DESIGN WORK SO WE KNOW MUCH MORE BEFORE WE GET THERE AND THAT'S WHAT OUR THAT'S OUR APPROACH ENTAILS TWO OTHER POINTS JUST AFTER MISTREATMENT. QUESTIONS I MAKE A BRIEF PLACE. WHY ON THE CONNECTION MERCED. LOOK TODAY WHETHER OR NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL IS OPERATING BETWEEN PERCENT OR BAKERSFIELD. TODAY WITH THE EXTENSION OF AS IN THE DOWNTOWN PERCENT WHICH IS ALREADY FUNDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS HAPPENING. AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO MERCED AT THE END OF THE DECADE. BOB THEY'RE GOING TO A DIFFERENT STATION IN MERCED SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WOULD GO TO. AND THE CITY OF MERCED AND MOST TRANSIT ADVOCATES WOULD SAY WE ARE TO BUILD A SINGLE STATION IN MERCED. FOR ALL OPERATORS TO GO TO SO WE HAVE BETTER TRANSIT CONNECTIVITY. AS GOES TO THE BAY AREA THE SAN JOAQUIN'S GO TO SACRAMENTO AND OAKLAND. AND YET THE IDEA IS FOR A SINGLE STATION AND WERE SET. AS WE INDICATED LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE. THAT STATION STILL HAS TO BE. DESIGNED IT CLEARED AND FUNDED. AND WE DON'T THINK THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY SHOULD FUND THAT STATION BY ITSELF BECAUSE THE BENEFITS INVOLVED. AS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM WHICH NOW GETS FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO OPERATE. SO ALTERNATELY A SINGLE STATION IN MERCED IS THE RIGHT DECISIONWE AGREE WITH THAT. AND WE THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE AUTHORITY TO DO ALL THE WORK TO GET THAT SINGLE STATION LOCATED FUNDED AND BELT. AND IT'LL BENEFIT RIDERS GOING TO OAKLAND. SACRAMENTO AND OTHER POINTS IN THE BAY AREA. IT WILL ALSO. IMPROVE CONNECTED IN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND LASTLY ON THE ONLY. QUESTION IN THE AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UP EVEN THE ORIGINAL OUR AGREEMENT AS A PRINCIPLE MATTER SAID THE RESULT OF THESE FUNDS LIKE TO FIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM ABOUT. AND SO WHAT WE GET BACK WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. BUT PROPOSED TO RESCIND FEDERAL DOLLARS THIS PROJECT AT AND WE NEGOTIATED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- HOW TO GET THOSE DOLLARS BACK. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE INVESTMENT WAS STILL THE SAME THE LECTURE BY HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IS OPERATING ABOUT SO THE AGREEMENT SAYS THAT. NOW IF CALIFORNIA AS A STATE THE SIZE. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ELECTRIFIED IN THE VALLEY THE START IT'S JUST A MATTER OF LIKE TO DO ELECTRIFIED EVERYWHERE ELSE BUT I DON'T HAVE MONEY. FOR IT SO IF WE DON'T DO ELECTRIFIED SYSTEM OPERATING IN THE VALLEY NOW YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A STATE AND FIGURE OUT IF THAT'S OKAY. AND THEY'LL HAVE TO THEY'LL HAVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT THE- BUT- CAN. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE ARE FUNDS. THROUGH THE RECENT DOCUMENT IS FOR LIKE TO FIVE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM OPERATING CALIFORNIA WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY THEY KEPT. WE SEE GREAT BENEFITS TO THAT IN THE VALLEY AS THE ORIGINAL AND FIRST BUILDING BLOCK. WHICH WILL EXTEND. FROM THERE BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT'S IN THE AGREEMENT. THAT WE THINK IT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS BETTER. RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE. YOUR TURN WE- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO ADD ON AS WELL AND MISTER CHAIR. IF YOU CAN DO SO VERY BRIEFLY WERE RAPIDLY RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK CARE. I APOLOGIZE AND JUST A FEW CLICKS SPENDING OUT ON OTHER PARTS OUTSIDE OF MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD- AS WAS MENTIONED BY AND BY MISTER KELLY- THE AUTHORITY WANTS TO DANCE DESIGN OUTSIDE OF THAT OF THAT MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD AND YOU KNOW THAT'S A PROBABLY IMPORTANT THING IF YOU'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING WORK OUTSIDE OF REJECTED A CONCEALED THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT BUDGETED AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT THAT THEY EXPECTED TO COST TO DO THAT ADVANCED DESIGN. THAT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET SO EITHER WE HAVE YET FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO THAT AND MAYBE THEY MATCH THIS THAT WITH THEM STATE BENEFITS AND CLEAR WHAT AND THIS WOULD BE SO- I THINK IT IS IT IS A QUESTION I MEAN IT'S THEORETICALLY EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET PLAN HE'S ALREADY COULD USE SOME OF THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO MATCH FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW PERHAPS OTHER STATES WHICH IS TO BE USED FOR THAT BUT THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY BUDGETED- AND SO TO THE EXTENT FUNDS WERE USED FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD THAT WORK YOU ARE CURRENTLY THIRD DESIGNATED FOR MERCED BAKERSFIELD THAT COULD INCREASE THAT FUNDING GAP SO THAT WAS OUR POINT THERE ON THE TRACKING SYSTEMS WHAT HE'D WANT TO COMMIT TO THAT BEFORE AND THE LINE CONNECTED TO POPULATION CENTERS. JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT ONE I THINK ONE IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION OUT WHEN YOU WANT TO DO TRACKING SYSTEMS IF YOU WANNA MAKE SURE YOU GOT ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT AWAY AND THE CIVIL WORKS IS REALLY FAR ENOUGH ALONG THAT YOU DON'T START LOOKING TRACK I MEAN I KNOW THE ORIGINAL. RP THERE HAD LAYING TRACK IN IN VERY SMALL SEGMENTS LIKE LESS THAN TEN MILES- BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK WE WERE GONNA GET ALL OF THE WORK THAT ENHANCE FACT THAT TO CHALLENGE LIKE BACK BACK WE REALLY PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE DOING WE WANT TO WAIT MAKE SURE WE AT LEAST HAVE THE CIVIL WORKS IN GOOD SHAPE BEFORE STARTLING TRACK THAT WE DON'T END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE- YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE TO LAY CLAIMS- AND THAT'S BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR THE STATE IN THE PAST- SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO DO YOU. TO THINK ABOUT ALSO TWO TRACKS- ARE A VERY VALUABLE AGAIN AS MR KELLY MENTIONED SO I'M GETTING RESPECT TO PROBABLY NEED FEDERAL FUNDING TO DO THAT SO DO WE WANT TO RELEASE THE CONTRACT AWARDED TRACKING. SYSTEMS CONTRACT BEFORE WE NO IF THAT FEDERAL. IS AND THERE INTO THE- WHERE THE- WORDING THAT COULD. LATER THIS YEAR TO CLEAR THAT KNOW ABOUT. FUNDING THAT. SO THAT I THINK I KNOW KEY FOR. TO THINK. THEIR CERTAINLY- OF. YOU KNOW THERE ARE NONE. OF KEY THING ALSO I DO A PRE. CERTAINLY THE AT THE WORD TO LAY THE TRACK INSIST CONTRACT SOMEWHERE ALREADY. BUT WOULD NOW- KNOW. AGAIN THAT THAT. THAT THAT WE TALK ABOUT THAT GRANT AGREEMENT. EFFECTIVELY CONNECT THE STATE'S ELECTRIFICATION SO ON ONE HAND THROUGH DIFFERING THAT ACTION BUT THEN. I'M YOU REALLY. PREVIOUS GRANT AGREEMENTS REALLY HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THE ELECTRIFICATION. AND THIS GRANT AGREEMENT HOW THAT WITH THE TROOPS. IN MANY PLACES THROUGHOUT THE AGREEMENT SO- AGAIN IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER WE COULD KIND OF- YOU RENEGOTIATE WITH THAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OR WHETHER WE DO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO REDDING ELECTRIFIED TRAINS. I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THE DETAILS AGAIN BUT- BUT IT REALLY IS A CHANGE IT WAS VERY NOTABLE BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS GRANT AGREEMENT IN THIS ONE. ELECTRIFICATION WITH ADAM YOU KNOW NUMEROUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT. AND THEN JUST FINALLY- ON THE CONNECTION TO MERCED I THINK IT'S CRITICAL. THAT WE HAVE A GOOD CONNECTION RESET AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE RIGHT NOW. THE PLAN IS. THAT THE CURRENT STATIONS WOULD BE THIRTY THREE OF THEM RIGHT ONE CONSERVING THE SAN JOAQUIN. ONE EIGHT TO COME INTO AND IT OR HE'S TRYING TO COME INTO YET A THIRD ONE. I'M SO I THINK EVERYONE AGREED THAT THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WE NEED IT TO BE ONE STATION. RIGHT NOW. EXTENDING. OUR HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE WILL HAVE TO EXTEND. TO GET TO THAT PROPOSED A STATION AND THEN THE SAME WORKING WITH TO COME AND- THAT EXTENSION. I NOW INCLUDED IN THE- SO ANOTHER THAT WOULD PROBABLY ADD SOME THAT CAUGHT. SO AGAIN THEY WANT YOU. TO WORK THAT'S NOT MY CALL YEAH THEY WANT TO DO YOU THEY WANT TO EXTEND NORTH TO GET TO THE STATION ASU'S PLANNING THAT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET YET. THEY'RE ALL THESE PIECES THEY WANTED YOU DOUBLE TRACKS IT'S NOT REALLY THAT THE- BUDGET BUT- AGAIN IT'S NOT CLEAR BACK BEFORE. YOU HAVE AN OPENING FOR THEIR A LOT OF PIECES OUT THERE. IMPORTANT PIECES OF THE PROJECT TO MAKE THE PROJECT WORK REALLY WELL BUT AGAIN AS MR KELLY MENTIONED. THE AUTHORITY REALLY HAS VERY CONSTRAINED FUNDING RIGHT AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE NEEDED. TO REALLY MAKE THAT STATION. B. AS GOOD A CONNECTION AS POSSIBLE TO REALLY MAKE THAT. DON'T YOU KNOW DOUBLE TRACKING HAPPENED. TO DO THAT AGAINST THE FINE WORK AND THAT'S CERTAINLY TO DO OTHER WORK OUT TO PAY FOR SUCH A BAKERSFIELD- SO I KNOW THAT WAS VERY QUICK BUT HOPEFULLY THAT WAS. THE PREFERRED IT- BUT- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK. THANK YOU. MISTER TECH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IF. IS THE- THANK YOU I MEAN YOU'VE BEEN. THESE SPEED RAIL HEARINGS. OUR ENTIRE TENURE BELIEVE THE LIKE YOUR TEN. HIGH SPEED RAIL HEARING REALLY PER. YOU IN YOUR LEAD- IN ON THIS ISSUE. TRYING TO KEEP KEEP THE OVERSIGHT ON TOP THE AGENCY- JUST WANT TO START WITH MISTER THOMPSON I REALLYAPPRECIATED YOUR PEER REVIEW REPORT- IF I CONTRAST. YOUR REPORT WITH MR KELLY SUPPORT I WOULD THINK THAT I'M TALKING. ABOUT TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROJECTS. SO- SOMEONE FROM. USER FRANCISCO HIGH SPEED RAIL VERY IMPORTANT TO US WHEN WE HAVE A STATION THAT WE'VE ALREADY BUILT OUT THAT'S WAITING FOR A TRAIN. I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT DURING MY TENURE LEGISLATURE I'VE SEEN THE- THE REBUILDING OF THE BAY BRIDGE AS WELL AS OUR NEW TRANSBAY TERMINAL SERVING THE EAST BAY. OF WHICH THERE IS AN EMPTY SHELL OF A TRAIN STATION WAITING TO BE BUILT OUT FOR. A HIGH SPEED RAIL AT SOME POINT. SO GORGEOUS GOING TO- MR ARE. MISTER THOMPSON FOR A SECOND JUST. COULD COULD YOU- IF YOU DO WOULD YOU HAD ADVISED US TO HAVE SOME SORT OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT WITH MORE EXPERTS TO MORE EXPERTISE IT SEEMS LIKE. WE NEED TO HAVE A PROBLEM MUCH DEEPER DISCUSSION WITH MR KELLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND REALLY FLESHING OUT WHAT THIS WHAT REALISTICALLY. IT CAN BE DONE WITH THE SORT OF FORTY AND I THINK IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN DISCUSSION SEEM TO HAPPEN SPORADICALLY BUT NOT WITH THE CONSISTENCY THAT'S NEEDED TO REALLY FLESH OUT OF PLANS I WAS HOPING TO GET YOUR ADVICE BECAUSE HE SEEMED. YOUR REPORT WAS EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL BUT ALSO- JUST READING BETWEEN THE LINES SEEMED RATHER PESSIMISTIC TO AT THAT THAT THAT THE SAME POINT. ALL WE HAVE SAID SINCE HE I SAW HER FIRST REPORTS ON THE PROJECT THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DEVOTE MORE ATTENTION AND MORE RESOURCES TO CONTINUING OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS NO DEDICATED STAFF OF PEOPLE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT REQUIRES A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT A- DEDICATED NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WITH ACCESS TO ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY NEED WHO CAN ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE YEAR AFTER YEAR ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE PROJECT INSTEAD WHAT WE'VE HAD IS HEARINGS ONCE A YEAR OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE MANY TIMES ON THE DIFFERENT HEARINGS. AND NO SENSE OF CONTINUITY OR HER DEATH IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW OF THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE- BY ANY MEASURE THIS IS THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE HAS EVER UNDERTAKEN AND THAT'S LIKELY TO BE THE LARGEST PROJECT THE STATE EVER UNDERTAKES. SO IT DESERVES THE MORE REVIEW MORE ATTENTION AND MORE UNDERSTANDING. ON THE PART OF THE LEGISLATURE OF WHAT THE PROPOSAL'S MEANING OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT IS AND WHAT THE RISKS ARE IN A REALISTIC WAY- THIS COULD BE DONE EITHER AS WE DIDN'T WE SUGGESTED POSSIBLY A SPECIALIZED STAFF WITHIN THE L. A. O. BUT THERE MAY BE MANY OTHER WITH. COMP WHICH THIS ON AMTRAK FOR EXAMPLE HAS AN INTERNAL INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT REPORT TO THE CONGRESS ON ON THE ISSUES AND AMTRAK THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL CONSIDERS TO BE IMPORTANT FOR ON ISSUES THAT THE CONGRESS HAS ASKED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ANALYZE FOR THEM. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THIS THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS ON IMPROVED AND CONTINUING LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROJECT I BELIEVE IN THE INTEREST OF CALIFORNIA IT'S SOMETHING. YOU WOULD ONLY NEED TO DEVELOP. NO NO THANK YOU MISS THOMPSON I THINK THE IDEA OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL SO I THINK A REALLY GOOD IDEA. WE HAVE ONE FOR OUR CORRECTIONS SYSTEM AND I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OFFICES WORK IN THAT ONE AREA HAS REALLY- BEEN ONE OF THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOTS IN THAT SYSTEM I WOULD SAY AND REALLY. HIGHLIGHTING AND REALLY HELPING US PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT I MEAN AS AS YOU ARTICULATED- I THINK YOU ARTICULATED OUR ENTIRE CHALLENGE AROUND OVERSIGHT NOT JUST IN HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT OVER. EVERY SINGLE- DIVISION AND DEPARTMENT WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT WHICH IS QUITE LARGE QUITE COMPLEX IN DOING- YOU KNOW VERY SOPHISTICATED THINGS I THINK- I THINK YOUR IDEAS ARE GREAT- WILL BE TAKEN TO HEART WILL BE TALKING- WITH OUR CHAIR HERE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN- FEEL. FRANKLY TO DO OUR PART I JUST GO AND GO TO MISTER KELLY ON. WITH TAX BEFORE THE VIEW MISTER THOMPSON SO ON. BASED ON WHAT YOU KNOW TODAY I MEAN HOW CONFIDENT. ARE YOU ABOUT THE COMPLETION EVEN OF THE SEGMENT THAT IS FUNDED WHICH IS THE MERCED TO. BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT- BECAUSE- YOU'RE WITH YOUR CLOSING STATEMENT IT DIDN'T IT DIDN'T SOUND LIKE YOU HAD AS MUCH CONFERENCES. I WOULD HOPE. USE THAT QUESTION FOR PRIME CAL IN CALIFORNIA I'M SORRY I WANTED TO FINISH AT THE THEY'RE GONNA MISTER KELLER FOR SECOND. ALL WE SAID LAST YEAR IN OUR LETTER THAT WE- THINK THAT COMPLETION OF COMMERCE SAID THE BAKERSFIELD PROPOSAL. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL ALL FEDERAL MONEY IS GOING TO BE UP WOULD REQUIRE THAT EVERY THING GO RIGHT. OF EXPERIENCE WHICH WE HAVE NOT HAD TO DATE. SO THERE IS A RISK AND I WOULD NOT BE CONFIDENT THAT WITH THE EXISTING MONEY THAT BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED CAN BE COMPLETED THAT WOULD DESTROY FEDERAL MONEY OF COURSE BROUGH CHANGE THAT. WHAT WE NEED TO ADD AND I DID SAY TODAY AND BRIAN ALSO AGREED. THAT GETTING OUTSIDE THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF NEW MONEY THAT HASN'T. TRIED YET. THANK YOU I'D APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS OF PUTTING- PUTTING A SOME BALL IN OUR COURT WHICH IS A THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO AS A LEGISLATURE. HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HOW TO HOW TO FIND AND PAY FOR THIS- AND THAT THERE ARE THERE ARE YOU AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE PROBABLY DOES NEED TO BE A CLEARER. MESSAGE COMING OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW A NUMBER OF US REPRESENT OUR OWN DISTRICTS AND THEIR THOUGHTS IN THIS AREA BUT I DON'T KNOW I WOULD AGREE WITH YOU I KNOW THAT THERE IF THERE IS ONE Q. SET OF. LEGISLATIVE THOUGHT- SO DON'T GO JUST MISTER KELLY JUST KIND OF PIGGYBACKING ON. MISTER MISTER THOMPSON'S POINT OF VIEW WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT THAT- IN ORDER TO FINISH THE CURRENT PROJECT WE'RE GONNA NEED ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. WELL AS WE ARE IN LET ME JUST CHECK A COUPLE THINGS FIRST- ONE THING THAT LIEU THOMPSON HAS BEEN SPOT ON FROM FROM DAY ONE I CAN. THINK WE CONCUR WITH. YOU ARE OUR ONLY SOURCE OF ONGOING FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT RIGHT NOW IS CAP AND TRADE FUNDING INTO EVERYTHING ELSE IS ONE TIME. BOND DOLLARS WHAT TIME FEDERAL FUNDING. WHEN WE CAN GET AND TRADE AND CAP AND TRADE HAS HAD MOMENTS OF VOLATILITY. AND SO THE NUMBER ONE RISK THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN. FOR ANYTHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS A FUNDING RISK. WHAT WE HAVE ADVOCATED IN FOUR CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS. THAT THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM BE EXTENDED TO THE COMPLETION DATES AND THE A PROGRAMMATIC BATES OF THE BENEFITS OF THAT PROGRAM TO TWENTY FIFTY. OR WE ASKED HIM REQUESTED THAT WE BE ABLE TO FINANCE AGAINST THOSE PLANS WOULD YOU BRING MONEY FORWARD SO I DID YOU KNOW FUNDING STABILIZATION IS A KEY PART OF WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE ADVOCATING FOR AND WHAT WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR. R. THE HARDEST PART OF MY JOB AMONG MANY DIFFICULTIES. IS TRYING TO DEFEND TO FOLKS. THAT I SOMEHOW HAVE FUNDING TO DO IT ALL. I DON'T. NOT QUITE CANDID ABOUT THAT. I HAVE A WE HAVE ESTIMATED A BUDGET WE HAVE TO TWENTY THIRD. AND WE THINK THAT WE HAVE ESTIMATED WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THAT. AND WE THINK IT GETS AN OPERATING RUN GOING TO THE VALLEY THE KEY RISK IS A FUNDING RISK. BECAUSE CAP AND TRADE HAS BEEN VOTER. AND I WILL BE NEW WILL MORE I WILL LIKELY NEED NEW FEDERAL MONEY TO MAKE SURE I CAN DO THAT AS A DOUBLE TRACK. AND WHAT THAT IS NOT A NEW OR SURPRISE. WE INDICATED THAT LAST YEAR. AND SAID YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF BUDGET CONSTRAINTS WE CONSIDER A SINGLE TRACK BUT A DOUBLE TRACK. WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FEDERAL FUNDS IS A GOOD PLACE TO GO. AND SO OUR OPPONENTS OF THE QUESTION BUT- BUT BUT FUNDAMENTALLY YEAH HE'S RIGHT THE VOLATILITY OF ARE FIGHTING TO. GET BIGGEST CIGARETTES AND THE LIMITATIONS. NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK I THINK. THE CHURCH ADDRESS I THINK YOU'RE THE ONE BY TAKE AWAY WITH. MISTER THOMPSON I TOTALLY AGREE WITH HIM IS- IT I WOULD EVEN SAY THE- BEYOND THE LEGISLATURE NOT BE ON THE SAME PAGE THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE- AND- YOU KNOW. YOU IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH US AND- IF WE WOULD LIKE THIS PROJECT TO GO FORWARD I THINK WE DO NEED TO TAKE MISTER THOMPSON'S DEVICE. GET TOGETHER- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE THAT DISCUSSION AND YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT DISCUSSION EVEN GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR. THE DISCUSSION HASN'T HAPPENED- THERE THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING THERE IS NO AGREEMENT THERE USE. THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN A- OUTSIDE OF THESE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS A- DISCUSSION REALLY. ABOUT WHAT IS THE YOU KNOW THE STATE'S LONG TERM VISION AND I'VE MET WITH PARTS OF THE STATE I MEAN. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT LET LEGISLATURE YOUR YOUR BODY YOUR BOARD. MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IT I THINK YOUR- YOUR YOUR FRUSTRATED BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING. A FUNDING COMMITMENT. AND THE LEGISLATORS ON WILLING TO GIVE YOU A FUNDING COMMITMENT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SIGNED OFF ON A PLAN COMMON THIS IS A VERY LARGE PROJECT MR THOMPSON'S RIGHT A LOT OF MOVING PARTS LOT UNCERTAINTY. THAT IS THE- BIGGEST PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AT THIS. TIME SO I THINK IF YOU. IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WE WANT THIS PROJECT BEFORE I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO- SIT DOWN. WITH OUR HOUSE THAT DOWN WITH THE SENATE CAN REALLY HAMMER THIS OUT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO IT FRANKLY TOGETHER- EURO YOU OTHERWISE YOU COULD I THINK YOUR YOUR FAIR YOU'RE COMPLETELY FAIR TO SAY HEY. I THINK A COMMITMENT I'M GONNA DO WHAT I CAN WHAT I GOT THAT'S ALL I CAN DO AND I THINK AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING TO SOME EXTENT I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR STATEMENT- WE ON THE OTHER HAND CAN EXPECT ANY MORE ANY LESS. AND LESS WE COMMIT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING BUT AGAIN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMMIT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT WE'RE COMMITTING TO DOUBT. FOR ME PERSONALLY FOR MY DISTRICT FOR MY CITY I THINK WE CONTINUE TO BE- ARE. FULLY COMMITTED TO THIS VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS CONNECTION FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA I FOR ONE WOULD LOVE NOTHING BETTER TO BE ABLE TO. HOP ON A TRAIN IN DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO AND END UP IN IN DOWNTOWN LA YOU KNOW A FEW HOURS LATER- SO HAVING SAID THAT THAT THE VISION IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW I PERSONALLY REMAIN COMMITTED TO I KNOW OUR OUR REGION STANDS FAIRLY COMMITTED TO THAT BUT- I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE MINORITY MY CAUCUS AND ALSO I THINK I'M IN THE MINORITY IN THE STATE AT THIS POINT- SO. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR CHAIRS LEADERSHIP AND REALLY TRYING TO KEEP KEEP THE BALL MOVING- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE- ALL OF US WHO WHO CARE ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND WE ALL NEED TO KIND OF SIT DOWN AND HAMMER OUT A LOT OF THESE. DETAILS AND DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HER DOCTOR MISTER THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR TANK- AND I'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THAT- AS WE- CONCLUDES. OUR HEARING TODAY I DO HAVE AN UPDATE FOR YOU- I AND I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE WHO. HERE TO- PARTICIPATE IN OUR SPEAK ON ITEMS THREE THROUGH TWELVE. BUT WE ARE GOING TO PUSH ALL OF THOSE AT A OFF TO A FEW MEETING AND- RESTRICT OURSELVES AND GIVE OURSELVES MORE TIME. ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT WILL- COMPLETE ITEMS ONE AND TWO- ISSUES ONE AND TWO. ON- QUAN ON THE AGENDA I'M THE WITH THAT OF THE MOVE ON TO- VICE CHAIR FONG WANT TO COMMEND YOU- COMMAND- THE CHAIR PLEDGING TRANSPORTATION- ON THE ROBUST CONVERSATIONS UP TO IN THE TOUGH QUESTIONS EVE- OVER I'VE- I'VE ACTUALLY SERVED- ON THE BACK ON THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. ON SEPT THREE AND ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- OF WATCHING THIS PROJECT I KNOW HOW. MUCH OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE- OUR OUR OUR BED IN BUILDING SO- AS SOMEONE WHO- IS AFFECTED BY THIS PROJECT IN MY COMMUNITY BAKERSFIELD- CERTAINLY- THIS IS. A BIG DEAL AND- OVERSIGHT IS NECESSARY I COMMEND THE CHAIRED THE BUDGET COMMITTEE- ON HIS QUESTIONS WE MAY COME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION. BUT I THINK MORE OVERSIGHT IS COMPLETE NECESSARY AND- I HUMBLY REQUEST MAYBE WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL- HEARING MAY BE THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE- ON THE ON GOING TO THE SPECIFICS OF HIGH SPEED RAIL- BUT- I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND MY QUESTIONS ARE ARE DIRECTED TO THE L. L. BUT- I FIND IT VERY INTERESTING AND I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THIS TO MEMBERS IS THAT. WHAT SHE SAID IN HER TESTIMONY WAS THAT HE- REPORTS TEN YEARS AGO HIGHLIGHTED. THESE ISSUES AND THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED. AND I'VE SAID THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE PAST THAT THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS PAST BEHAVIOR AND SO WE EXPECT. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO CHANGE SOMEHOW. WELL SOMETHING SOME EXTERNAL FORCE HAS TO BE PLACED ON IT. AND AND AS THE CHAIRMAN SHOULD BE FOR- AND OUR FREIGHT ALFREDO IT DIFFERENTLY. IT'S INTERESTING TO ME. THAT THE HIGH THROUGHOUT THIRTY IS ASKING FOR MORE MONEY. BUT THEN WE DON'T LIKE WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE MONEY SO WHY WOULD WE GIVE. THEM MORE MONEY IF WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING. I WILL LASTLY SAVED IN MY COMMENTS. THAT WHEN WE WENT HIGH SPEED RATHER ONE THE CONCEPT OF HIGH SPEED RAIL OR THIS PROJECT WAS FIRST PUT ON THE BALLOT. THE ESTIMATE WAS THAT THIS ENTIRE PROJECT WOULD BE THIRTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS- ON THE ON THE HIGHER RANGE. SO SO MY QUESTION TO THE ELIO IS. HOW REALISTIC. IS THIS BUSINESS PLAN I MEAN IN IN YOUR IN IN YOUR CANDID ANALYSIS I'LL THE SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT. JUST FOUR- AN EXAMPLE. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ASSUMES AN INFLATION RATE OF TWO POINT 25% FOR COST MATERIALS THE CURRENT RATE OF SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. AND YOU INDICATED IN YOUR HAND OUT THAT THE INFLATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. WAS ELIO HOW REALISTIC IS THIS BUSINESS PLAN. I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF RISK RIGHT THERE AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS I THINK ABOUT THIS BUT IT IS- PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT BY- I THINK THERE'S A RISK ON THE ON THE CONSTRUCTION COST SIDE AS YOU AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERTAINLY COST COULD BE HIGHER I MEAN THIS IS REALLY NOT. A TIME WHERE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF AND INCREASES IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF RISK- IF IT'S PROJECT THERE'S THE AGAIN FOR THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT THAT RESEARCH OR CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT SOMETIMES REFERRED TO THAT ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT- YEAH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE FINAL CONTRACTOR CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED THAT AND THAT AMOUNT COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WE JUST DON'T KNOW RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE INFORMATION. AND AT YET- FROM THE AGORI WERE HOPING TO GET SOME- WE'RE WE'RE THANK YOU- WITH THEM AND- OUR OFFICE IS MAJOR QUESTION- BUT AT THIS POINT WE DON'T HAVE HAVE- ANY INFORMATION REALLY ON WHAT THE SCALE OF THOSE COSTS WILL BE THEN THE EXTENSION TO MERCED AND- BAKERSFIELD THOSE ARE REALLY STILL THE VERY EARLY PLANNING STAGES. NO THERE'S JUST THERE'S RISK THERE TO YOU RIGHT SO THERE'S GONNA COSTS AND THEN ADDS MR KELLY MENTIONED THERE CERTAINLY WAS GONNA ON THE REVENUE SIDE TO YOU I MEAN CAPITAL RESTORED CLEAN HANDS I'M HAS GONE UP AND DOWN OVER YOU KNOW IT'S NOT ALWAYS IT'S NOT SUPER CONSISTENT SO WE HAD A COUPLE REALLY ROBUST RAP- AUCTIONS. BUT WHAT I CAN SEE THE TWENTY THIRTY THERE'S JUST A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES SO I'M I WOULD HAVE LIKE THAT I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S TOUGH TO SAY- NO PROBLEM YEAH BUT WE NEED TO GET A LOT OF FEDERAL FUNDING MAYBE THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE ISSUE I THINK HISTORICALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD IT FUNDED I. WOULD SURMISE BY THE SAME THING TWICE SO- YOU FIGURE OUT WHICH PIECES WE CAN GET THEM TO FIND THEY'VE ALREADY FUNDED- YOU KNOW THE ONE NINETEEN ON THE TRACK WELL WHAT THEY COULD TO GET THEM HELP WITH EXTENSIONS WOULD WE WOULD THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN GRANTS YOU KNOW. I'M GRATEFUL SITUATION THERE'S NO MONEY THAT'S DEDICATED FOR THIS PROJECT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BELL- MORE FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE. BILL SO IT'S COMPATIBLE SO IT'S JUST ME JUST DON'T KNOW- AND- THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE AD WELL THAT'S BECAUSE- COSTS. YOU KNOW THAT THEIR- HIGH. OF INFLATION INCREASE IN CONTINUE. IF IT DOES I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE. CERTAINLY JOHN FOR THE PRIDE BUT- BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST HARD HARD TO THAT CRISP BALL. WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT IF THEY'LL BE INCREASE ITS MUCH IS THE SO A WHAT IT MAKES. FOR THE L. A. ELEMENT. DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS BASED ON DIFFERENT RANGES ASSUMING. DIFFERENT INFLATION RATES- AND MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR- FOR THE THOMPSON AS WELL. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. ALL THE BUSINESS PLAN IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE ASSUMPTIONS IN IT. ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE WRONG THEN WE'RE MAKING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF INVESTMENT- ON SOMETHING THAT IS INCORRECT AND SO IF THERE'S A TWO POINT 25% AND INFLATION RATE ASSUME TO BY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WOULD MAKE SENSE TO DO- DIFFERENT RANGES ASSUMING 5% I'LL DEFER TO LIVE IN JUST A MINUTE YEAH I MEAN I THINK I THINK THAT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO HAVE A RANGE RIGHT AND IT ALREADY HAS INTRODUCED IN THE LAST FEW BUSINESS PLANS THEY'VE INTRODUCED THEM YOU KNOW AFFECTIVE RANGES AND SO THERE IS CURRENTLY A RANGE FOR EXAMPLE FOR CENTIMETERS. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T INCORPORATE THAT SORT OF MAYBE EXACTLY THE RANGE OF CONSTRUCTION COST INFLATION SO I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING REASONABLE TO THINK ABOUT- JUST RECOGNIZING ESPECIALLY THAT THE I MEAN I THINK FOR YEARS RIGHT WE WERE IN THIS RELATIVELY LOW INFLATION ENVIRONMENT AND MAYBE THIS WAS JUST LESS OF A CONCERN. AND BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL WE WERE SEEING YOU KNOW PRETTY MODEST- INFLATION AND YOU KNOW OVER THE LAST YEAR THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC AND WE'VE SEEN MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED INFLATION YEAH MORE BROADLY AN ECONOMY AS WELL AS- CERTAINLY THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO- I THINK IT IS WORTH IT SORT OF REVISITING THAT AND THINKING ABOUT HOW THAT SHOULD BE. IT SHOULD BE WORKED AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORITY ON THAT AND WILL- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU. HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO ADD THE WORD I KEPT YOU. WAS AND- THAT IS WE DON'T KNOW THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF. OUTCOMES FROM THE- COST ESTIMATES THAT WE HAVE ARE M. S. I DON'T SEE THIS TO BE CRITICAL OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY I SIMPLY SAY IT TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THESE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO TURN OUT AND WE CAN'T HELP THESE NUMBERS TURNED OUT PART OF THAT. IS THAT PAST EXPERIENCE DOESN'T GIVE US RIGHT YET CONFIDENCE IN FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THAT WE WILL BE NICE IF IT DID BUT IT DOESN'T. LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED AT I THINK IMPROVEMENT IS THERE BUT THE LESSONS HAVE BEEN LEARNED HAVE BEEN EXPENSIVE AND THEY'VE BEEN LEARNED THE HARD WAY. BUT ALSO. WE DO KNOW A LEADERSHIP DON'T WHO PROJECT BUDGET ARE NOT UP DATE HELLO AS WE DON'T WE HAVEN'T COURT. AS MUCH OF BIG. WE MY HAVE. WE DON'T HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WITH STUFF THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE YET LIKE ELECTRIFICATION OR TUNNELING OR OR SIGNALING A ROLLING STOCK IN THAT REPRESENTS MORE THAN HALF OF THE COST OF THE PROJECT. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL IMPACT OF COVER IT IS GOING TO BE IN TERMS OF INFLATION AND TERMS OF PERFORMANCE. ALL IN I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I WAS RUNNING THE NORTHEAST CORNER. DURING THE CARTER ADMINISTRATION WHEN WE TRIED TO UPDATE. BUDGETS THE WHAT INFLATION REALLY ONES WE WERE TOLD BY IT WOULDN'T BE THAT THAT CONFLICTS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVEAL TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT INFLATION IS GOING TO BE. SO YOU CAN'T UPDATE. SO BRIAN IS OPERATING WITHIN CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE IT REALLY HARD FOR HIM TO GIVE YOU. ACCURATE INFORMATION. NORMALLY WHAT YOU WHEN THIS SEARCH. MAKE A MAJOR EFFORT TO ATTRACT ALL OF THE AREA BOB. SOME YOU CAN'T ATTACK WE DON'T KNOW WHEN INFLATION IS GOING TO BE NEXT YEAR HOW LONG THAT IS GOING TO. CONTINUE BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY ATTACK THE NEED FOR UP TO DATE THE MOST RECENT UP TO DATE INFORMATION THE MOST RECENT. UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DATE AND- THEN CERTAINLY PRESS OWN THINGS LIKE ALL TRYING TO GET ESTIMATES THE BEST AVAILABLE ESTIMATES OF STUFF THAT HASN'T DONE YET BASED ON FOREIGN EXPERIENCE SO. OVERALL I THINK THE ADVICE THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT TAKE THESE NUMBERS WERE CAUTIOUSLY. BECAUSE THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES END OF THE TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ACQUIRE THE BEST POSSIBLE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN AND WHAT THE EXPERIENCES TOLD US. I THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSON I THINK IN THIS HEARING I'VE LOST TRACK OF THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THE WORDS RISK AND UNCERTAINTY HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. COM AND I THINK IT GIVES ME GREAT PAUSE- MY LAST QUESTION I'M SENSITIVE TO THE TIMES I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE- THE ABILITY ASK QUESTIONS WELL ADD TO THE L. A. L. ON YOUR LAST ON THE LAST PAGE OF REPORT- YOU'VE INDICATED- AND YOU WROTE THIS. OUT. THAT- THE OF THE SHE COULD I A BUNCH TRAILING LIMITING OR PREVENTING- HSR A FROM COMMITTING THE STATE SUCH AS THE TERMS OF GRANT AGREEMENTS ECCENTRIC CETERA- TO UNDERTAKEN WORK BEYOND WHAT THE LEGISLATORS COMFORTABLE COMMITTING TO FUNDING AS SPECIFIED IN STATUTE THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT GIVEN THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS ENTERED INTO PASSED GRANT AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE CONSTRAINED. LEGISLATIVE CHOICES YOU'VE INDICATED ONE EXAMPLE BUT COULD YOU GIVE US ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES IN WHICH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS CONSTRAINED OUR- OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS. WELL I WOULD ARGUE THAT THAT THAT SORT OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT AGREEMENT THAT WE SIGNED INITIALLY- REALLY SORT OF SET IN MOTION A LOT OF THIS PROJECT IN A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THE PROJECT IS BASED- I THINK EVEN THE AUTHORITY- HAS MENTIONED A NUMBER OF TIMES THAT. YOU KNOW WE RUSHED WE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDS WERE GONNA DO THE CENTRAL VALLEY RIGHT WE HAD TO START RIGHT AWAY YEAH THESE THESE THAT THESE VERY SHORT- DEADLINE. I TO SPEND ERA FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE AND WE THAT WE- ENTERED INTO THAT. TO CONTRACT BEFORE WE REALLY DONE THE PRELIMINARY WORK BEFORE WE DIVE RIGHT AWAY BEFORE WE DONE THE DESIGN- AND THE STATE ENDED UP- HAS HAS BEEN PAYING FOR IT- REALLY EVER SENSE AND THOSE ARE STILL THE ISSUES THAT. I THINK MISTER KELLY WAS REFERRING TO SOME OF WHICH ARE SO HE'S HE'S STILL WITH SOLVING YOU KNOW CLAIMS AND OTHER ISSUES THAT RELATE TO THAT RIGHT. SO YOU KNOW THAT'S PART OF IT'S GREAT TO GET FEDERAL MONEY I THINK WE KNOW WHAT WE AT THE STATE ALWAYS LIKE TO GET- GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE DO NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS. ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT WHEN WE- DO THOSE AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHERE DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T HAVE REQUIREMENTS THAT COSTING US MORE YOU KNOW. I'M AND CREATING MORE CHALLENGES FOR THE STATE SO I THINK THAT'S BEEN JUST REALLY HISTORY OF THE PROJECT FROM FROM REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S BEGINNING THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSTRAINED BY OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENTS- AND THAT SORT OF- YOU KNOW. MADE MADE MADE THE PROJECT MAKES THEM STOP OPTIMAL CHOICES RUSHED THINGS THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RUSHED PERHAPS- AND MADE IT MORE CHALLENGING AND THEN AND CERTAINLY THIS MOST RECENT- GRANT AGREEMENT THAT THAT REALLY- IDENTIFIES ALIVE. THE ELECTRIFICATION REALLY THROUGHOUT SO THAT'S IT THAT THERE'S I THINK I THINK. AGREE ABOUT THAT ON IT PROBABLY MORE THAN. ONE CASE. I THANK YOU- THAT IS VERY ALLOW. I'LL JUST CAN BY. THAT I THAT THERE'S BETTER ABOUT OF TAX- WE NEED TO RE OF THE PROJECT- WITH OUR WIDE MAY ISSUES THAT ABOUT BEEN OUT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS PLAN THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO US- SINCE I'VE BEEN LEGISLATURE AND SINCE I'VE SERVED IN A TRANSMISSION COMMITTEE AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT- I WOULD CERTAINLY ASK- MY COLLEAGUES TO DO MORE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS- ON THIS PROJECT ON A CONSISTENT BASIS I KNOW THAT CHAIR AND- THE ON THE AND THE JOB TRANSPORTATION IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE- IN THE BUDGET YEAR HAVE COMMITTED. ARE COMMITTED TO OVERSIGHT AND SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE MY COLLEAGUES TO DO THANKS VERY MUCH MR. I YOU'RE WELCOME MR FONG WE HAVE A MISTER PATTERSON FOLLOWED BY MS RIVAS MS FRIEDMAN AND I THINK- MISTER SMITH THIS. AND BENNETT. MISTER THANK YOU. UP I A CAR I HAVE. PERSONAL REVIEW- THIS DRAFT PLAN AND I HAVE ALSO PARTICIPATED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND- LISTENING TO THE QUESTIONS THE COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES IN MY VIEW THIS DRAFT PLAN IS UTTERLY INADEQUATE. AND IN FACT I THINK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEFEND IT AS A BUSINESS PLAN. I HAVE ANYTHING MORE TO SAY I DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS TO ASK BUT I DID WANT TO. MAKE THAT STATEMENT FOR THE RECORD RIGHT I THANK YOU- AND IS RIVAS BEFORE YOU BEGIN WITH YOUR REMARKS OR QUESTIONS- WHAT WE PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND ALLOW YOU TO ADD ON TO THE VOTE ONLY- A CALENDAR THE VOTE THAT WE TOOK EARLIER. I HAVE HAD. ABOUT ONLY RIVAS AT. I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY A- ALL RIGHT- WE. MISERY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I THINK A LOT OF MY CAR AND HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY OUR TRANSPORTATION CHAIR AND OUR BUDGET CHAIR OF I FEEL LIKE WE GO THROUGH THIS EVERY YEAR RIGHT I'VE BEEN ON THIS SUB COMMITTEE MOST OF THE TIME THAT I'VE SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY OUR END OF I FEEL THAT IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO GET. THE ANSWERS THAT WE WANT. OR THAT WE NEED TO MAKE THE FUNDING DECISIONS FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY- AND ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT. ARE I BELIEVE MISTER THOMPSON MADE- WAS HOW DO WE STRUCTURE OURSELVES IN THE LEGISLATURE. OF TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT R. THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROJECT THE- ONE OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS EVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW ARE WE CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. OF AT TO PROVIDE THAT OVERSIGHT TO THE AUTHORITY FIVE AND YOU I'VE BEEN THINKING LIKE EVEN BETWEEN HOUSES YOU KNOW IS THIS THE TIME. THAT WE CONSIDER PERHAPS A JOINT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FREIGHT BECAUSE- THIS PROJECT. ITSELF DOES IT POTENTIALLY DESERVES A COMMITTEE THAT COULD BE MADE UP OF- THE CURRENT CHAIRS- THAT. CURRENTLY HAVE. THE JURISDICTION IN THEIR COMMITTEES. YOU KNOW I THINK THE PEER REVIEW SUGGESTED THAT THE MANAGEMENT ISSUES. OF OUR PERHAPS THE FAULT OF THE LEGISLATURE BUT- WE HAVE BEEN TRYING. TO YOU KNOW GET INFORMATION THAT WE NEED AN- EACH DRAFT PLAN AND WE GET VERY LITTLE OF. ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS OFTEN WHEN WE APPROACH EITHER THE AUTHORITY OR THROUGH THE DRAFT PLAN STILL DOESN'T ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS WHAT WERE EXPECTED TO VOTE AND RELEASE FUNDING TO THIS PROJECT SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN THINK MORE ABOUT OUR OWN STRUCTURE HERE. AND WHETHER. THERE IS ANOTHER WAY FOR US TO PROVIDE THAT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. THANKS. OKAY THANK YOU- MS FRIEDMAN- ARE YOUR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS RELATIVELY SHORT BECAUSE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS AN OPPORTUNITY WHO HAVEN'T SPOKEN ALREADY FOR SHORT THANK YOU SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR WITH THE BUSINESS PLAN IT IS ROLLING STOCK PURCHASES IN THE BUSINESS PLAN AND IF SO WOULDN'T IT MAKE MORE SENSE. TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN FINISH YOUR TRACK AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO HAVE A COMPLETE SYSTEM BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO PURCHASING ROLLING STOCK. YEAH WE ARE NOT COMMITTING TO PURCHASE AND ROLLING STOCK BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF ROLLING STOCK TO PURCHASE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO DESCRIPTION THERE'S NO DECISION MADE YET ELECTRIFICATION NOT. WE DID PUT IN THE PLAN AND WHAT WE PREFER TO DO. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA GET INTO THE PROCUREMENT OF ROLLING STOCK WE DON'T HAVE ALSO DECISION. WELL WECERTAINLY STAND BY. TWO DISCS HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AS WE DID LAST YEAR AND THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LOVE TO SIT DOWN AND- TRY TO WORK OUT THESE DETAILS. AT THAT WE HAVE MISTER SMITH NEXT OF ALL BY MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR INSTEAD OF A VERY ACTIVE MEETING HERE. BUT THE PROBLEM IS WE GOT ON A BUDGET PLAN. THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BUDGET. BECAUSE WE HAVE A OF BUSINESS PLAN THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. APPROVE FUNDING FOR. WE WON'T HAVE THE BUDGET FOR ANOTHER YEAR. SO MY QUESTION IS IN REGARDS TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE SETS BEFORE US. WHAT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO THE REST OF THE PROJECT IF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL DOES NOT GET IT FUNDING. MAYBE THE L. A. O. OR WHO CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND THEN I WOULD ASK YOU IS THE CHAIR OF SUB THREE. FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUDGET CHAIR KING AND VICE CHAIR FONG IF WE CAN TOTALLY SEPARATE THIS OUT IN THE BUDGET STRICTLY FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL WE ALL HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH IT. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A PACKAGE WITH OTHER ITEMS THAT WE HAVE MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA AND HAVE A STAND. BUDGET ITEM. AND WE WILL KNOW FOR THE VOTE OF THE LEGISLATORS FOR THE- PEOPLE IN THEIR DISTRICTS KNOW EXACTLY HOW THEY STAND WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL THE ROAD. FOR THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT STARTED OUT WITH THE VOTERS APPROVED IT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT'S GOING TO COST THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND I WAS GOING TO GET ON IN LOS ANGELES AND BE IN FRISCO. IN AN HOUR TO. THERE WERE NO WHERE NEAR THAT. OVER A 130% OVER BUDGET ALREADY THERE WERE NO WHERE NEAR WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE. WE HAVE A PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT MIGHT BE A BICYCLE PATH TO WE STARTED WITH TWO TRACKS NOW WE'RE DOWN TO ONE TRACK WE HAVE NO TRACK AND NO TRAINS. WE NEED TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS PROJECT AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A STANDALONE BUDGET ITEM. SO THE EIGHTY MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY. CAN VOICE OUR CONCERN FOR CONSTITUENTS THEY REPRESENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FINALLY SAVE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN HIGH SPEED RAIL CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THING- CHAIR TANGO IS NOT HERE. TO HEAR YOU REFER TO IS CITY BY SHORTHAND THAT'S NOT PREFERRED. MISTER SMITH BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO JUST TRY TO POINT OUT SOME RISK THAT I THINK HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED OR APPROPRIATELY- CLARIFIED WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN STATED THAT THE GREATEST RISK IS THE LACK OF- CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BUT I WOULD OFFER TO YOU EQUALLY AS GREAT IS A COMPLETE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH COST AND THEY THEY ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST ARE NOW IF YOU IF YOU JUST WENT TO THE PUBLIC AND SAID. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOOD RARE TACKLE THE BIGGEST PROJECT WE'VE EVER DONE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUNDING IS GOING TO BE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COST ARE I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD PLANNING IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD. BUT THIS PROJECT WAS INITIATED BY INITIATIVE FRIED BITE BITE BITE OF OVER THE PUBLIC SO DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PLANNING PROCESS BUT I WOULD OFFER A THIRD RISK THAT I THINK IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO COME UP BECAUSE WE'RE SO DESPERATE FOR FUNDING. AND THAT IS THAT A DESPERATE SEARCH FOR SHORT TERM FUNDING IS CAUSING US TO MAKE DECISIONS STEP PUT THE WHOLE PROJECT AT RISK. AND YOU JUST HEARD STAFF SAY WE ONE OF THAT FEDERAL MONEY WE HAD TO GET CONTRACTS SIGNED RIGHT AWAY SO WE SIGNED CONTRACTS BEFORE WE EVEN HAD DESIGNS. AND NOW WE'VE GONE BACK AND WE FIND OUT AND WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE MOVING TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO THE PUBLIC AND THE POLITICAL SUPPORT NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO JUST TAILSPIN DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY CAN'T GET THEIR HANDS ON THIS SO I WOULD OFFER A THIRD RISK. IS THAT WE CAN. A THE TO. OF GRAB. SHORT FUNDS. THAT REQUIRE US TO DO THINGS THAT IN THE LONG RUN ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE PROJECT RIGHT- AND SO. THAT INITIATIVE IS THE EXACT. OPPOSITE WAY OF HOW YOU WOULD LAUNCH THE BIGGEST PROJECT AT AND IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT WE'RE NOW STUCK WITH WHERE WE ARE. SO THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO WE STOP. M. PAUSING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY CHAIR I REALLY WANT TO CATCH IS PART HOW HOW DO WE STOP. AND REASSESS ALL OF THOSE RISK AND TRY TO ELIMINATE AS MANY OF US POSSIBLE GIVEN WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT SO I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEEN APPROPRIATE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS MADE BY- THAT ARE CHAIRED BY TRANSPORTATION CHAIR MR TANG AND IT AND EVEN OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE FOR THE OTHER SIDE FROM FROM- ABOUT THE FRUSTRATION THERE'S LOTS OF FRUSTRATION OUT THERE BUT IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T. LAUNCHED THIS PROJECT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING APPROPRIATELY AND I'VE THINK RATHER THAN US AS MISS REAVIS SAID EVERY YEAR WE'RE BACK HERE. IF I THINK THIS IS THE YEAR WE SHOULD STOP AND SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME BACK HERE NEXT YEAR JUST LIKE THIS WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA TRY TO EVALUATE THE BEST WEEKEND THERE'S BEEN SOME SUGGESTIONS I REALLY APPRECIATE HIM. AND WANTED TO JUST OFFER THAT THOUGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MUCH AND- OF IT WILL HAPPEN MR YEAH. THANK YOU- I GONNA GO BACK TO MISS SMITH- THE HE CORRECTLY REMINDED ME THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY GIVE STAFF A CHANCE TO ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS- I NOT STAFF BUT- ARE A SPEAKERS QUICKLY WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF. WITH ALL THE OTHER PROJECTS IT'S IN THIS REQUEST IF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL DOES NOT GET. OF FUNDED AND IS TO THE ALEJO'S OFFICE PROBABLY WILL BE THE BEST ONE. SO I'LL TAKE A WE HAVE ASKED pADMINISTRATION AND THE RESPONSE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN IS THAT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A PACKAGE WITH A FOUR POINT NINE BILLION OF A GENERAL FUND TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS TO THE BASICALLY IT SHOULD BE ALL CONSIDER TOGETHER THAT'S HOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS. PUTTING THAT FORWARD SO THAT THE RESPONSE WE'VE GOTTEN FROM THEM I DEFERRED AT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE REALLY- YOU KNOW WHO ARE REALLY PUTTING THAT FORWARD SO THEY MAY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS AS TO IT SORT OF WHAT THEY MEAN BY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL PACKAGE. BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE ASKED THAT QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS YOU KNOW HOW THEY ARE LINKED TO YOUR- THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A PACKAGE SO- PERHAPS FINANCE- MIGHT HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS- MISTER CHAIRMAN. YES AND WE HAVE A- MR MORE- WAITING ON ISSUE TO- FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- MISTER MOORE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU CAN- ENLIGHTEN US ON THAT QUESTION. BUT WHAT. THE STEVE WELLS IN THE OF BY- ARE I CAN STEP PLEASE. I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU VERY YOU KNOW THE- OFF UP THIS AS A AS A PACK- MOSTLY BECAUSE THE- TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL. FUNDING THAT WERE THAT IS PART OF THIS COHESIVE PACKAGE- THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE BUILDING A SYSTEM. USABLE AND WE'RE BUILDING UP A SYSTEM STATEWIDE SO AS PART OF THE SYSTEM WE HAVE THE WE HAVE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY WITH THE ONE A MONEY WE ALSO ARE MAKING FUNDING AVAILABLE TO ADVANCE COMPLEMENTARY PROJECTS- IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- JUST STARTED TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT IS THAT IS A COMPREHENSIVE HE SAID AS WE PLAN TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT- I MEAN. IF YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT A PART OF THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS THAT WE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE- TO GUARANTEE THAT. WERE WERE MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE OF THE DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS. AND YOU KNOW SORT OF EVERYONE EVERYONE WORKING TOWARD A COMMON GOAL ON THE TRANSPORTATION PACKAGE VOTE BUT pTHAT'S WHY WE PUT IT TOGETHER. AS A PACKAGE RATHER THAN AS A SEPARATE- A SEPARATE GROUP OF FUNDING OR- COULD IT BE CONSIDERED. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S IN YOUR OFFICE. TO SEPARATE THESE ITEMS OUT SO WE CAN GET A DEFINITIVE IT DIDN'T FIT EVAN OF ANSWER ON HIGH SPEED RAIL WE STILL NEED ALL THESE OTHER PROJECTS. BUT PUTTING THEM ALL TOGETHER. COULD POSSIBLY KILL ALL PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH HIS FUNDING. IF HIGH SPEED RAIL IS NOT APPROVED. I'M I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE A QUICK APRIL COULD YOU COULD YOU THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR WALKER THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITY IS TO. DEVELOP A PLAN THAT INCLUDES HIGH SPEED RAIL SO WE'VE OFFERED UP THIS PACKAGE THAT WERE- HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO WORK WITH ALL THE MEMBERS TO DEVELOP SOMETHING BUT WE WANT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S HIGH PRIORITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL CONTINUES. AND THAT WE COMPLETE THE SOMETHING. BUT THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE PUT IT IN THERE. AS A PACKAGE THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE FORWARD. REALLY HASH IT OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT BUT I GUESS MY ANSWER TO YOUR YOUR ANSWER IS A KNOW. THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO SEPARATE IT OUT WE CAN DO JUST HIGH SPEED RAIL. AND WE CAN'T DO ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THE ANSWER IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PRIORITY IS TO USE THIS ENTIRE PLOT OF FUNDING. TO COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT INCLUDES HIGH SPEED RAIL. THANK YOU THE CLIP THE FUNDING OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. MISTER BENNETT IT'S JUST VERY QUICKLY YOU JUST STATED THAT HE DID TO. YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY IT WITH THE ONE A FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT IS AT. THE OUR SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS CONFIDENT THAT- THERE WON'T BE MORE MONEY NEEDED TO COMPLETE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I'M HEARING WITH ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTIES OUT THERE. WE BELIEVE THAT AND AS IT AS IT HAS BEEN- PRESENTED FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL AS A WORKING COMPLETION OF THE OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT ALONG WITH- ALONG WITH THE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE- ADDITIONAL BOOK IT OR NOT BOOKING SEGMENT THE ADDITIONAL- BAKERSFIELD AND MERCED EXTENSIONS WITH THE AVAILABLE FUNDING. THAT WE PROTECT HAVE AVAILABLE. THREE TWO THOUSAND THIRTY ONE TRACK OR TWO TRACKS. THIRTY ONE TRACK WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO EXPAND THAT THE TEACHER THANK YOU. SERVO BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE- PACKAGING HAVE- ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. I'M I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE OVERALL-PACKAGE THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE IN MY VIEW IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN KIND OF AN INVITATION IN THE GROCERY EIGHT. AND UP TO THIS POINT THE NEGOTIATIONS HAVE NOT GONE WELL- BUT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS HAPPEN AND THERE'S A LOT OF LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM BECAUSE I GUESS THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY- BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING FROM TODAY'S HEARING IS THAT I'M HEARING A LOT OF AREAS OF AGREEMENT ON GOALS ON WHAT WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO IT. CHIEF WITH THE HIGH SPEED RAIL- PROJECT- I SEE NO REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT PUT OUR SHOULDERS INTO THE NEGOTIATIONS AND- TRY TO ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT THAT NEEDS AS BEST AS POSSIBLE ALL THE GOALS THAT WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE AS THE LEGISLATURE MANY OF THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE- AS A LEGISLATURE. AND THE ADMINISTRATION CALLS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A- ALL- LIKE I SAID A LOT OF AREAS OF AGREEMENT WE COULD BUILD ON THOSE- THE FUNDING SOURCE ISSUE IS A THORNY ONE AND ONE THAT- WILL CONTINUE TO BEDEVIL THIS PROJECT BECAUSE IT IS- A LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OF I'M TAKEN BACK TO- OF THE BIG DIG PROJECT- IN BOSTON WHICH IS MANY MANY DECADES OR MANY DECADES OLD- AT THIS POINT. BUT IT WAS ALSO A VERY CONTROVERSIAL VERY BIG- VERY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX AND UNDER FUNDED PROJECT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE. PRICE ESCALATIONS I DOUBT THAT THERE IS ANYONE. IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS ARE CERTAINLY IN THE CITY OF BOSTON WHO TODAY WOULD SAY- IT WASN'T WORTH IT- BECAUSE IT PROVIDED CRITICAL. CRITICALLY NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE AND- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT CITY AND REGION- ALSO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE- CONTINUE TO TRY AND- A REACHING AGREEMENT- WITH- OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND WITHOUT- WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WILL BE HOLDING OPEN IF YOU WANT A AND ISSUE TO TODAY BUT- ISSUE TWO IS OUR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE PRESENTATION- AND TO KICK IT OFF WE HAVE- CARLOS QUANT THE DEPUTY SECRETARY.

THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE PROPOSING OVER NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE INVESTMENT STATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO PATEL HELLO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY AND POSITION THE STATE TO PURSUE SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING THESE INVESTMENTS WILL CREATE QUALITY JOBS ACCELERATE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS SUPPORT CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND PROVIDE BETTER CONNECTIVITY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE PACKAGE INCLUDES POINT ONE BILLION IN THE IN THE- SYSTEM. I WILL PROVIDE A BRIEF. THE COMPONENT. THE FIRST INVESTMENTS THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION FUND. FOR HIGH PRIORITY TRANSIT AND RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE. DISMANTLED LOCAL TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM AND WILL PROVIDE RAIL AND TRANSIT CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL OR REGIONAL SERVICES. PROVIDE MOBILITY OPTIONS AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE NEXT INVESTMENT I SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND TO ADVANCE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS THAT EXPAND WALKING AND BIKING NETWORKS. INCREASED THE STADIUM MOBILITY OF PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS ADDRESS EQUITY THROUGH PROJECTS TO RECONNECT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN HARMED TRANSPORTATION SECTIONS OF THE PAST AND PRIORITIZE MOVEMENT OF CARS OVER PEOPLE. THE NEXT INVESTMENT IS FIVE SUPPORT CRITICAL SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS ARE GREAT CROSSINGS. THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE REAL ROADS CROSSING THE HIGHWAY OR STREET AND SECOND LEVEL. THERE ARE MANY OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE MOST DANGEROUS OF THESE CROSSINGS. THIS CAN BE DONE BY SEPARATING THE ROAD AND RAIL REVENUE TWO SEPARATE LEVELS OR BY OTHERWISE INCLUDING THE GRADE CROSSINGS TO ADD MORE PROTECTION. THIS INVESTMENT WILL HELP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL GRADE CROSSINGS ACROSS THE STATE. THE NEXT INVESTMENTS FOUR HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS.

SAFETY AND EQUITY GOALS. THAT CONCLUDES MY BRIEF SUMMARY THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL MY COLLEAGUES AND CAL STATUS REPRESENTATIVES IN HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL ASK FOR A REPORT FROM THE- L. A- NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRANK JIMENEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE- WE HAVE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS. I'M THE FIRST BEING IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED PACKAGE. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ANTICIPATED FEDERAL FUNDING FROM MY AJ. ENSURE THAT STATE FUNDS ARE USED TO TEACH ECKLEY- THIS COULD INCLUDE SUPPORTING LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES WHERE FEDERAL FUNDS. ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT ARE ABSENT AS WELL AS HELPING THE STATE BE COMPETITIVE AND RECEIVING DISCRETIONARY PROGRAM. NOW WE ALSO RECOMMENDED LEGISLATURE CONSIDERED YOUR GRAPHIC EQUITY AND TRANSIT RAIL FUNDING. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZES THAT SOME LEVEL OF BASED FUNDING SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE. I'M CURRENTLY PROPOSED- THE TRANSIT EVERY OPENING WOULD GO THROUGH THE TRC P. PROGRAM. WHICH IS A COMPETITIVE PROGRAM- WE FIND AT A COMPETITIVE PROCESS COULD ENSURE THAT THE HIGHEST QUALITY PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BUT IT CAN ALSO RESULT IN FUNDING ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE NOT. DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING SOME FUNDING FOR TRANSIT RAIL PROJECTS TO EXISTING- FORMULA BASED TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DEDICATED FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS- SIMILAR TO THE FUNDS DEDICATED FOR THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION- AND A RECOMMENDATION AREN'T WE'RE NOT INDICATING THAT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS- COMPLETELY- COMPETITIVE PURSES FORMULA DRIVEN. JUST ENSURING THAT SOME BASE LEVEL OF FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED. EQUITABLY ACROSS ALL REGIONS- WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE VALUATIONS OF THE NEW PER PROPOSED PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES. INFORMATION REGARDING PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES TO INFORM FUTURE POLICY AN FUNDING DECISIONS- THIS IS- PARTICULAR TO THEM I WASTE THE BOULEVARD PILOT PROGRAM. AND THE SEVERAL CRIME ADAPTATION PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY THE PROPOSED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS HAS LIMITED. REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRAM EVALUATIONS- WE FIND THAT HAVE NEEDS OF. WHAT BETTER INFORMED LEAD UNDER THAT AND CHALLENGES OF THE PROGRAM'S AN INTERN GUIDE. WHETHER AND AT WHAT LEVEL TO CONTINUE FUNDING FOR THESE PROGRAMS IF THE LEGISLATURE WISH TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE- AND IT WOULD ALSO HELP THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE IF ANY MODIFICATIONS WERE NEEDED FOR THESE PROGRAMS- AND THEN FINALLY RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE BE MINDFUL OF THE STATE APPROPRIATION. LIMITS AND ASSESSING THE PACKAGE- AS ANY RIO REALLOCATION OF THIS FUNDING WILL NEED TO BE FOR SOME REALLY- SAT RELATED PURPOSES- THAT ENDS OUR COMMENTS AND HAVE TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THERE THANK YOU- NEXT WE HAVE FOR MISTER MOORE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HI JAMES MORE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD AT THIS POINT- OTHER THAN HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE QUESTION IS PROBABLY BEST ADDRESSED TO MR QUANT- I'VE BEEN HEARING. GOD FROM MY CONSTITUENTS ORGANIZATIONS- IN AND AROUND MY DISTRICT THAT THE L. A. REGION. HAS NOT BEEN GETTING ITS FAIR SHARE OF FUNDING AND- I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT. AND IF YOU AGREE HOW DO WE- GET TO A MORE EQUITABLE FUNDING SOLUTION FOR. UP FOR THE FOR THE REGION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A PROPORTIONAL DEFERRED CHIU UNDERSECRETARY WAS GONNA. THANK YOU BYE MISTER CHAIR- HAPPY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ON IT THE THREE POINT TWO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL- TRANSIT FUNDING I TRANSIT RAIL FUNDING PROPOSED IN THIS PACKAGE- WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES AND- PROVIDE A CALL FOR PROJECTS. I TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY- IN THE PRIORITY TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU- IT PROBABLY WOULD BE- HELPFUL THAT WAS- WRITTEN INTO THE ACTUAL BUDGET- DOCUMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD- BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO- MAKE CERTAIN THAT THEIR- IS EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDING. I THINK OF MR MULLIN HAS SUCKED. MISTER I THINK IT WAS SHARED YEAH JUST A OF QUESTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- AS YOU'RE AWARE THAT CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION% PROJECT REF REFERENCE A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY THIS MORNING- IS IN MY DISTRICT IS NEARING COMPLETION NEEDS ADDITIONAL STATE OF FEDERAL FUNDING. SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITY BUT- WITH THE WITH THE FUNDING PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THE T. I. R. C. P. BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPLETE THAT CALTRAIN PROJECT AND OTHERS AROUND THE STATE THAT MAY BE IN SIMILAR. SITUATIONS IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT AND THEN- MIGHT YOU BE OPEN TO UP BUDGET LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ENSURE THE ELIGIBILITY OF THESE PROJECTS. LAKE WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THE OUT RECENT BAY AREA LETTER THERE'S REACH A LETTER SIGNED BY- NUMEROUS- TRANSPORTATION PARTNERS IN THE REGION SO IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THAT JUST THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. AND THE ELIGIBILITY FOR A PROJECT LIKE THE CALTRAIN ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALYSSA CONNER FROM TULSA AGAIN I. YES WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE NEEDS- FOR THESE TRANSIT AND RAIL PROJECTS- WE BASE OUR PROPOSAL ON THE TRC KEY. PROGRAM BIG BECAUSE THESE ARE GENERAL FUND ONE TIME APPROPRIATION REQUEST WILL BE LOOKING TO MODIFY OUR TYPICAL GUIDELINES- TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT- YOU'VE MENTIONED. I FROM OUR TRANSIT AND RAIL SYSTEMS- SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY TO WORK. TOGETHER ON AND TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING ALL OF THOSE NEEDS. OKAY AT THE END OF THE F. BUDGET BLUE CALL FOR A TEN BILLION FOR TRANSIT RAIL AND I KNOW WHAT. OUR TRANSPORTATION CHAIR CAN CAN SPEAK TO THAT BUT I HAD A QUICK QUESTION ON GRADE SEPARATION FUNDING. OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FUNDING STATEWIDE. WHICH FRANKLY IS MERELY A DANCE AND WHAT IS IT TEN BILLION DOLLAR. FIGURE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE WIDE NEEDS SO- CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO JUST THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING ON GREAT STEPS AND WHAT KIND OF A- PRIORITY THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVING TO THAT ISSUE. YES THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER I AND IT DID SO CROSSINGS ARE EASY ERY- AND EXPENSIVE. AND COMPLEX- CENTER PROJECT ON BUT ALSO VERY NECESSARY. FOR TO IMPROVE SAFETY OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL WOULD TARGET- I DID SOME OF THE- MOST. DANGEROUS INTERSECTIONS- AND TRY TO BRING AND SOME KEY PRIORITY PROJECTS- DATED THEIR ENSURE CONNECTIVITY AND SAFETY- AND BRING THOSE TO THE FOREFRONT. OF THE PACKAGE SO IT'S- TRYING TO BALANCE ALL OF THE NEEDS AND WITH YOU KNOW SOME CONSTRAINED RESOURCES- AND THAT SAID THE BASIS OF THE. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL JUST A PUTTING A NOTE OF HOW- LIKE. IS FOR THE ACTIVE- IN THE BAY AREA REGION- IT TRULY IS AN ECONOMIC ENGINE FOR ACTIVITY WHICH IS FUEL HELPING FUEL THE STATE BUDGET SURPLUS WE HAVE SO WITH THAT NOBLE PERFECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN- BEFORE YOU TURN YOUR MY COUGH WE NEGLECTED TO CALL YOUR NAME- WHEN WE DID TO ADD ONS FOR THE- ABOUT ONLY CALENDAR SO. LISTEN CAREFULLY OUR NAMES COMING UP FALLEN. THANK YOU. A MINUTE MS AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE WAITING TO GET PUBLIC WILL BE GETTING TO THAT VERY SHORTLY- WE WILL BE LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE TO- PURSE BAKER SO PLEASE PREPARE COMMENTS ACCORDINGLY MS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF FIRST ALL ECHO IT MISTER MULLIN SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRIFICATION AND FOR CALTRAIN- REALLY CRUCIAL PROJECT AND I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL COMMEND GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ARE VERY PROGRESSIVE AND VERY. A VISIONARY APPROACH TOWARDS A TRANSIT AND INVESTMENT IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION I WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT KIND OF VISION BEFORE OF I THINK FROM THE GOVERNOR AND IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE AN CERTAINLY COMPLIMENTARY OF ALL OF OUR GOALS WITH CLIMATE AND EQUITY AND MOBILITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE TRYING TO DO I WILL CONTINUE TO PLUG FOR EVEN MORE MONEY TO GO INTO TRANSIT- YOUR PARTICULARLY IN OUR POPULATION CENTERS THERE'S A GREAT HUNGER OUT THERE TO IMPROVE EXISTING TRANSIT AND TO EXPAND ON IT. AND GIVEN THE FEDERAL APPETITE FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS I THINK THAT'S ALSO A GREAT PLACE FOR CALIFORNIA TO PARTNER WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON THOSE GOALS AND IT CLICKED CHECKS EVERY BUTTON THE JOB BUTTON THE EMPLOYMENT BUTTONED- AND IS A TO BE CHECK BOX THE CLIMATE MOBILITY EQUITY IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS WRAPPED UP INTO ONE BUT I ACTUALLY MY QUESTIONS ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PART OF THIS WHICH IS ALSO EXTREMELY EXCITING- WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THIS REALLY UNFORTUNATE UBTECH IN FATALITIES. FOR PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT JUST CONTINUES TO TRACK ABOARD IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN I TO ME TO OUR CONSTITUENTS WE SEE IT BEING TALKED ABOUT FINALLY NATIONALLY THIS IS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO CALIFORNIA. AND ALONG WITH THAT INVESTMENT IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION WE ALSO- CLEARLY DID NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ALSO INCREASED SAFETY FOR THOSE USERS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING AND PEOPLE THAT ARE CYCLING AND I ALSO AND I'M CONCERNED THAT SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS DON'T. REALLY DO THAT THAT ADDING- ADDING THE USER- LEADS TO A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM FULLY UTILIZING THOSE SYSTEMS AND I HEAR THAT A LOT FROM. PEOPLE LIKE ME A MIDDLE. THIS ALMOST MIDDLE AGED WOMEN WHO WANT TO BE ABLE TO- TO BIKE AROUND BUT OUR MAYBE NERVOUS TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FULLY PROTECTED BIKE LANE THEY WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE SAFE AND I. I THINK THAT CONNECTING THE SAFETY- WITH ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AYE I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HOW. IN FOR HOW INFORMATION ABOUT THE BIKE SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS THAT CALTRANS HAS BEEN DOING GET COMMUNICATED HOW THOSE GET ABOUT WHAT PROJECTS GET FUNDED AND HOW. THEY ARE FUNDED. AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHANGES YOU THINK WE NEED TO MAKE TO OUR FINDINGS- PROGRAMS AND WHAT WE CAN DO IN THIS PACKAGE TO ENSURE THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE INVESTING IN. AFTER TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE BUT THAT WE'RE CENTERING A SAFETY AS WELL. THANK YOU. IMAGE FOR HER ALSO ANNOUNCED IT PART OF THAT IS ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR BIKE NETWORKS AND PEDESTRIAN AFTER COMPREHENSIVE THAT THEY'RE NOT LITTLE PIECES HERE AND THERE AND THAT THEY FOCUS ON ON REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED THAT THE RECREATIONAL CYCLING IS IMPORTANT BUT IF WE REALLY WANT TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION THAT'S REALLY AIMED AT COMMUTERS AND PEOPLE MOVING AROUND THEIR COMMUNITY TO GET TO THE ESSENTIALS OF LIFE SO WITH THAT I'LL STOP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE CALM- WITH QUESTION AFTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTIONS AT ARMS ARE BIG AND- DEPUTY- MARNA BALLS HERE TELL AND I WOULD ANSWER- THIS QUESTIONS ARE TIME OF OUR TRANSPORTATION ABOUT.

TO RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT THAT THEY WERE MENTIONED- AND LISTEN TO THAT- THANKS- BASED ON KIND OF HISTORICAL SEARCH DATA THAT WE HAVE SO WE THINK THE PACKAGE- ADDRESSES AS ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND- AND THIS HAS TAKEN- THOSE NEEDS INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH CLICK ON IT TO DO REAL QUICK WHAT IS A LIST SPECIFIC PROJECT LISTED FOR THE ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA CALIPHS OTHER CALIFORNIA. INFRASTRUCTURE.

CAPITAL PROGRAM- IN THOSE PROJECTS WOULD BE AWARDED. BASED ON THAT PROCESS. IT JUST TWO QUICK COM. I KNOW WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT A LOT ABOUT ELECTRICITY LECTER SHE ELECTRIFICATION OF THE STATE I THINK WE NEED TO USE OTHER ALTERNATIVES ON THINKING OF HYDROGEN WHICH IS A CLEAN ALTERNATIVE TO POSSIBLY. IF WE GET SOME FUNDING- FOR THOSE TO GIVE EVERYBODY A DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVE ON IT. BUT I'M AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE- FRIEDMAN. BICYCLE SAFETY I WAS PART OF VICTOR VALLEY BICYCLE TOUR. TO CARE FOR FIVE YEARS. ALL THE FUNDS THAT WE RAISE DID PUBLIC SAFETY THE THREE FOOT SIGN LAWS. A LINE DOWN THE ROAD DOES NOT PROTECT YOU LIKE THE- VILLAGE SAFE IN A CROSSWALK JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A LINE THERE WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

VERY QUICK IF I COULD RAISE MY VOICE IN SUPPORT OF BOTH THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN AND SENATE MEMBERS MISS COMMENTS- ABOUT SAFETY AND IF I COULD TURN THIS INTO JUST. ABOVE THE COMMON AND A QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS CAN WE PUT INTO OUR GRANTS- APPLICATIONS- EXTRA POINTS FOR THE SAFETY SIDE OF IT BECAUSE A SMALL INVESTMENT IN IN IT AND A MODIFICATION THAT IMPROVE IMPROVE THE SAFETY CAN DRAMATICALLY INCREASE HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO USE THAT I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I MEAN IN SACRAMENTO IN SOME PLACES HERE.
