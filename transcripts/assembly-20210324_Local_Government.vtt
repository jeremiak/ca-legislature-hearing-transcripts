WITH- COUNTY SHERIFF'S

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.442
THE IDEA OF ENSURING THAT IF

THE KEYS TO HOMEOWNERS UP WITH

KNOW ALL TOO WELL BEFORE THE

COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:10.385

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:12.421
WORST HOUSING CRISIS IS. AND

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:14.289
CONTINUES TO NOTHING HAS

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.826
CHANGED SINCE THE PANDEMIC ONLY

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:18.660
THAT THE OUTCOMES ARE EVEN

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:20.896
WORSE WE KNOW THAT MANY

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.198
FAMILIES ARE AT THE RISK OF

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.067
LOSING HOMES BECAUSE OF THE

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:27.402
PANDEMIC BUT EVEN THOSE

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:30.305
FAMILIES BEFORE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:33.775
TO OWN A HOME IS VERY ELUSIVE

01:18:33.842 --> 01:18:36.778
FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS. WITH

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.947
THAT ONE OF THE REASONS IS

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:41.249
SIMPLY HOUSING PRODUCTION. WE

01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:42.951
KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.252
ATTEMPTS TO BRING HOUSING

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:46.321
PRODUCTION BILLS TO OUR STATE

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.823
AND MANY HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OR

01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:50.158
STOPPED. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:51.393
THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY

01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:55.230
REASONS FOR THE INCREASE COST.

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:56.731
MY DAUGHTER HERSELF JUST

WITH ALMOST NO YARD HOME. AT A

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:14.182
VERY HIGH PRICE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.251
NOT VERY MANY HOMES AVAILABLE.

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:19.521
WITH THAT. I BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.523

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:50.572
COMMITTEE. UGH QUESTION FROM

01:26:50.638 --> 01:26:52.974
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAR HARBOR.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.409
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THIS

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.811
LEGISLATION I WAS WONDERING-

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:59.447
SINCE THE LAURA FRIEDMAN BILL

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.883
CREATED THIS WHEN TO AFFECTED

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.551
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:05.453
THEN WE'VE BEEN IN A PANDEMIC-

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.222
I'M NOT SURE. THERE'S EVIDENCE

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:09.490
OUT THERE THAT SHOWS THAT

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:11.092
CITIES ARE PURPOSELY

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.461
OBSTRUCTING THE ORDINANCE I'VE

01:27:13.528 --> 01:27:14.862
BEEN I WAS ON THE AND SENATE

01:27:14.929 --> 01:27:17.065
CITY COUNCIL EIGHTY YEARS ARE

01:27:17.131 --> 01:27:20.969
HIGHLY- ACCEPTABLE FORM OF

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:22.737
HOUSING IN MY CITY BUT I

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.305
BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY IN THE

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:25.707
NEED FOR LOCAL CONTROL AND

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:27.075
PASSING AN ORDINANCE. THAT

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.177
ALLOWS THIS TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT

01:27:29.243 --> 01:27:31.479
IS NOT ONEROUS OR DIFFICULT AND

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.381
SO I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:35.216
SAY THAT WE HAVE TO DO BY RIGHT

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.117
AND WE HAVE TO FORCE ALL CITIES

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.785
TO DO THIS. BECAUSE IT DOES GET

01:27:37.852 --> 01:27:39.587
RID OF SINGLE FAMILY ZONING AND

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:41.155
IT DOES GIVE A TURN CONVEYANCER

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:42.590
NONPROFIT AND THEY'RE GOOD

01:27:42.657 --> 01:27:43.625
NONPROFITS LIKE HABITAT FOR

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.627
HUMANITY WHICH I HAVE BUILT

01:27:45.693 --> 01:27:46.861
HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HOUSES

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.429
WHEN I WAS A BERKELEY. IT'S A

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:50.365
GREAT ORGANIZATION BUT IF IT'S

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:52.667
ANY NONPROFIT SO THERE ARE SOME

01:27:52.734 --> 01:27:53.901
BAD ACTORS OUT THERE SO I THINK

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.703
IT'S PREMATURE TO SAY WE NEED

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:56.938
TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE BY RIGHT

01:27:57.005 --> 01:27:58.539
THAT IT'S NOT WORKING I THINK

01:27:58.606 --> 01:27:59.974
THAT THERE'S EVIDENCE AFTER THE

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:01.509
PANDEMIC THAT IS NOT WORKING. I

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:02.577
THINK THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.379
TO BRING BACK THEN BUT TO SAY

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:05.780
WE'RE GONNA DO IT BY RIGHT AND

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:06.848
WE TAKE FOR AWAY SINGLE FAMILY

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.616
ZONING AND PLACES WHERE EIGHTY

01:28:08.683 --> 01:28:10.118
WAS ARE CURRENTLY ACCEPTABLE

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:11.219
MAKING IT PERHAPS NOT

01:28:11.285 --> 01:28:13.721
ACCEPTABLE IN OTHER PLACES- IS

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:18.526
NOT THE WAY TO INCREASE.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:19.060
HOUSING STUFF AND I'LL BE

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:19.694
OPPOSING THE BILL. THANK YOU DE

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:20.428
ASK ME QUESTION AND THE

01:28:20.495 --> 01:28:22.463
QUESTION WAS HAVE WE SEEN ANY

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:26.167
EVIDENCE- RELATED TO. ONEROUS

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.469
OBJECTIONS TO EIGHTY USE I

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.672
WOULD FIRSTHAND SAY I'VE NOT

01:28:30.738 --> 01:28:32.173
SEEN ONEROUS OBJECTIONS BUT

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.675
WHAT I WOULD SAY AT THE FOR

01:28:33.741 --> 01:28:35.243
EVEN THE CURRENT PROJECT.

01:28:35.309 --> 01:28:38.112
PROCESSES WITH THE LEGISLATION

01:28:38.179 --> 01:28:39.681
THAT WE HAVE PASSED IN LAST

01:28:39.747 --> 01:28:41.816
HANDFUL OF YEARS. THE LAST TWO

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:44.118
YEARS SPECIFICALLY. THEY STILL

01:28:44.185 --> 01:28:46.120
ARE VERY UNCLEAR ON SOME OF THE

01:28:46.187 --> 01:28:48.523
LANGUAGE WHICH WE ACTUALLY HAD

01:28:48.589 --> 01:28:49.424
ADDITIONAL PIECES OF

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:52.660
LEGISLATION. BUT DECIDED NOT TO

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:54.629
MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE- BY

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:56.464
MYSELF HAVE LOOKED INTO NAY D.

01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:58.966
YOU ON OUR OWN PROPERTY. AND AS

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:00.268
MUCH WORK AS WE'VE DONE IN THE

01:29:00.334 --> 01:29:02.036
STATE THERE STILL ARE CITIES

01:29:02.103 --> 01:29:03.871
AND IT IS CITY BY CITY I KNOW

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.474
IN YOUR AREA. THEY ARE MUCH

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.710
SWIFTER AS YOU ALL EVEN HAVE A

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.745
SHELF READY PLANS WHICH- WE

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.513
WOULD LIKE TO GET TO THAT. BUT

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.949
IT DEPENDS ON THE CITY. BUT AS

01:29:15.016 --> 01:29:16.818
FAR AS THE BY RIGHT WE'RE

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.920
TALKING ABOUT AUTHORIZING. BUT

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.521
IT STILL REMAINS WITH THE

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:22.990
SELLER IN NO WAY ARE WE

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.926
SUGGESTING THAT THE CITY COME

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:27.228
IN. TO EACH DEVELOPMENT OR

01:29:27.295 --> 01:29:28.496
SINGLE FAMILY HOME AND SAY YOU

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:30.498
HAVE TO BUILD A NAY D. YOU. OR

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:32.133
YOU MAY NOT ONLY HAVE TO BUILD

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.901
A DO YOU. BUT IN ADDITION YOU

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:36.070
HAVE TO CONVEY THAT TO. A NON

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:39.006
PROFIT SO THIS IS AN EXTRA TOOL

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:41.409
IN THE TOOL KIT. AND THE MAIN

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:42.710
REASON THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:45.079
DOING THIS IS TO MOVE FORWARD

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.815
WITH THOSE THAT CHOOSE TO BE

01:29:47.882 --> 01:29:49.884
ABLE TO. REDUCE THE LENGTH OF

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:51.853
TIME THAT IT'S TAKING TO BE

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.755
READY TO I MEAN WE CAN'T HAVE

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:57.492
EACH CITY AS WAS NOTED- LOOK AT

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.193
THE END OF. AND VOTE ON AN

01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:02.563
ORDINANCE OR NOT. AND WE KNOW

01:30:02.630 --> 01:30:04.732
THAT THOSE CAN TAKE YEARS AND

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:06.634
SOMETIMES A NEVER HAD.

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:09.003
SERIOUSLY IF THEY CANNOT BUT-

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:11.339
EACH CITY IS DIFFERENT BUT THAT

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.975
THAT'S OUR FOCUS ON THAT.

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:16.744
ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM. THANK

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.146
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:22.049
FORWARD- I- WANT TO MAKE

01:30:22.116 --> 01:30:23.951
CERTAIN THAT- AND I APPRECIATE

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.153
THE INTERCHANGE BETWEEN TWO IN

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:26.554
MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO MAKE

01:30:26.621 --> 01:30:30.158
SURE THAT- THE- THAT. THAT WE

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.292
UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS BILL IS

01:30:31.359 --> 01:30:32.527
ACTUALLY DOING BECAUSE I DON'T

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:34.762
UNDERSTAND THIS IS A BILL THAT

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.564
AFFECTS SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE

01:30:36.631 --> 01:30:39.133
ZONING. BOB WHAT IT DOES ALL

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.735
THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE A THIS

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.236
IS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL TOPIC

01:30:42.303 --> 01:30:43.304
BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER.

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:45.039
LEGISLATION PENDING IN THE

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:48.176
LEGISLATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR.

01:30:48.242 --> 01:30:50.378
LOT SPLITS AND DUPLEXES TO BE

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:52.213
BUILT AND A DUPLEX IS NOT A

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.748
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE WHAT

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:55.716
THIS DOES IS IT ALLOWS. A LOT

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:58.753
SPLIT. AND FOR THERE TO BE TO

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.355
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES. WHICH

01:31:01.422 --> 01:31:03.991
TO MY MIND IS VERY DIFFERENT-

01:31:04.058 --> 01:31:05.493
AND IS VERY COMPATIBLE WITH

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:10.498
THE- EXISTING NEIGHBORHOODS

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.567
THAT THE LOTS WOULD BE SMALLER

01:31:12.633 --> 01:31:14.168
AND IT INCREASES THE DENSITY OF

01:31:14.235 --> 01:31:17.438
A- VERY. MARGINAL WAY I DON'T

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.607
SEE THIS. TAKING OVER ENTIRE

01:31:19.674 --> 01:31:21.042
NEIGHBORHOODS OR ANYTHING LIKE

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.910
THAT IS NOT INTENDED TO DO THAT

01:31:22.977 --> 01:31:25.513
IT'S INTENDED TO PROVIDE-

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:29.517
NONPROFITS THAT- SERVE LOW

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:32.320
INCOME CONSTITUENCIES. AND AN

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.688
OPTION FOR CREATING SOME

01:31:33.754 --> 01:31:35.556
ADDITIONAL AFFORDABILITY AND

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:37.458
CURRENTLY ON AFFORDABLE

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:39.894
NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH IS MOST

01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:42.630
NEIGHBORHOODS- UNFORTUNATELY-

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:45.533
BUT I DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND A

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.903
LITTLE BIT BETTER- AND

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:51.105
STRUCTURALLY HOW THIS WORKS IS

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:57.245
THE- IS THE INTENT. HERE THAT.

01:31:57.311 --> 01:32:00.047
NONPROFITS WILL PURCHASE AN

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:03.184
ENTIRE PROPERTY AND- AND THEN

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:06.420
DO A LOT SPLIT- OR IS THE

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.589
INTENT FOR THE NONPROFIT TO

01:32:08.656 --> 01:32:12.293
WORK WITH AN EXISTING HOMEOWNER

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.862
TO DO A LOT SPLIT AND THEN. THE

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.998
LATTER THE LETTER AS FAR AS

01:32:17.064 --> 01:32:19.066
WORKING WITH EXISTING HOMEOWNER

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:23.738
SITE GO AHEAD SO MY QUESTION IS

01:32:23.804 --> 01:32:27.308
IN THAT SITUATION- HOW IS THE

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:32.380
VALUE OF THE- EIGHTY YOU PART

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:35.182
OF A OF THE LOT- HOW IS THAT

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:37.785
VALUE DETERMINED BECAUSE IF

01:32:37.852 --> 01:32:42.890
IT'S BEING- IF IT'S BECOMING. A

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:45.226
GOT LOW INCOME HOUSING. IT

01:32:45.293 --> 01:32:47.728
SEEMS TO ME THAT THE OWNER OF-

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:50.398
WHO'S SELLING OFF THE- THAT THE

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.333
SPLIT PART OF A LOT IS NOT

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.935
GOING TO RECEIVE FAIR MARKET I

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:56.470
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DETERMINE

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:57.038
FOR MARKET VALUE I GUESS. I

01:32:57.104 --> 01:32:58.706
THINK THAT. HOME OWNERS DON'T

01:32:58.773 --> 01:32:59.607
GET SHORT CHANGED IN THE

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.909
PROCESS. RIGHT AND I THINK IT

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.678
IS THE CHOICE OF THE OWNER AND

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:05.046
THE SENSE THAT THEY WOULD

01:33:05.112 --> 01:33:07.448
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY IN ESSENCE

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:09.817
ARE- WORKING WITH HABITAT WHICH

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:13.921
FOCUSES ON- INDIVIDUALS. WHO

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:18.125
ARE. IN THE- LOW TO VERY LOW.

01:33:18.192 --> 01:33:20.361
INCOME BRACKET ã BRACKET AND

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.663
SO THIS WOULD BE AN COULD SEEN

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:25.132
BE SEEN AS A WAY TO HELP SAYS A

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:27.268
SUBSIDIZED. THIS PROPERTY SO

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:28.836
THAT SOMEBODY COULD GET INTO A

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.471
PIECE OF PROPERTY. THAT

01:33:30.538 --> 01:33:32.273
WOULDN'T TYPICALLY BE ABLE TO-

01:33:32.340 --> 01:33:34.842

01:33:42.783 --> 01:33:44.418
TOGETHER WITH HABITAT AND MANY

01:33:44.485 --> 01:33:50.057

01:33:50.124 --> 01:33:52.393
THIS PARTNERSHIP TO TAKE PLACE-

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.894
