THIS STEAM JOINT COMMITTEE APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES TO BE ABLE TO BE WITH US. IT IS MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME OUR NEW VICE CHAIR FROM THE STATE ASSEMBLY WE HAVE A SIMILAR NUMBER STONE HERE FROM THE WONDERFUL CITY OF SANTA CRUZ WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF HIS WORK. HE WAS ACTIVE AND ENGAGED LAST YEAR AND JUST WANT TO SAY HOW EXCITED WE ARE TO WORK WITH YOU ASSUME NUMBER STONE. WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING FROM THE VICE CHAIR HERE AND JUST AT THAT AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. IN OCTOBER WE HELD A HEARING IN EUREKA JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE DOCKS AND NOW WE ARE THRILLED TO HAVE OUR FISHERMEN. COME TO THE CAPITAL ONCE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME HONORED TRADITION FOR FRTY FIVE YEARS EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FISHERY SPECIFIC COMMITTEES AND ORGANIZATIONS. ASSOCIATIONS COUNCILS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR FISHERMEN PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. ANNUAL REPORT IN AND REPORT ON THEIR GOALS. YEARLY ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. IN THIS YEAR'S FORUM TAKES ON SPECIAL IMPORTANCE IN THE REASON BEING IS PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LOOMING DANGEROUS PROPOSAL TO OPEN UP NEARLY THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA COAST TO NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DRILLING. AND THIS IS A MASSIVE THREAT TO DO IN POTENTIAL ASSAULT ON CALIFORNIA'S SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY UNDER TWO BILLION DOLLAR RECREATIONAL FISHING IN HISTORY. CFA PRESIDENCY GREATER THAN MAN WHOSE NAME IS ON THIS FORM. SPENT NEARLY A DECADE FIGHTING SIMILAR OFFSHORE OIL PROPOSALS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND I KNOW THAT HE WOULD BE SHOCKED THAT WE ARE RIGHT BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION WE THOUGHT WE WON THAT WAR. AND WHILE THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR IS WORKING OVERTIME AND YOU WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU SECRETARY LAYERED FOR ALL OF HIS WORK TO PROTECT OUR COAST. WORKING OVERTIME TO TURN BACK THIS DANGEROUS PLAN. WE MUST DOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO WIN THIS BATTLE ONCE AND FOR ALL BECAUSE NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IS THE LAST THING THAT CALIFORNIA'S FISHING FLEET NEEDS AT THE MOMENT. YOU ALL HAVE ENOUGH FIRES TO DEAL WITH. FOR EXAMPLE ARE FISHING PORTS COMMUNITIES IN TRIBES UP AND DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST WHOSE HEALTH AND VITALITY. IN ECONOMIES RELYING ON ROBUST FISHERIES ARE THREATENED THEY'RE THREATENED BY. CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS THAT'S RESULTED IN A SERIES OF DISASTER CRAP. SALMON SARDINE AN URCHIN ARE ALL LIKELY ANDIDATES FOR OFFICIAL DISASTER DECLARATIONS WITH CRAB ALREADY DETERMINED. THAT DIGITALLY CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS HAVE IMPACTED MANY OTHER SPECIES FROM SALMON AND SARDINES TO CROW IN WALES. CALIFORNIA IS FACING A NEW REALITY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NO LONGER A THEORY. IT'S HERE IT'S HERE IN CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT IS PAYING THE PRICE. NO MATTER HOW LOUD SOME IN WASHINGTON DC MAY SHOUT AND DENY. WE ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM CALIFORNIA'S EXTENDED DROUGHT FOR WATER MANAGEMENT KILLED MORE THAN NINE WE'RE PAYING THAT PRICE IN FULL. WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THE RECENT SALMON IN HOT WATER REPORT BY CAL TROUT IN UC DAVIS TODAY. THAT REPORT CONCLUDED THAT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S REMAINING SALMON STEELHEAD IN TROUT ARE WORSE OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE. ONE DECADE AGO UNDER PRESENT POPULATION TRENDS FORTY FIVE PERCENT. NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE SALMON ARE LIKELY TO BE EXTINCT IN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. DUE TO CHANGE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND WARMER WATER TEMPERATURES IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING SOON. AND WE ALSO KNOWN SOME TRIBUTARIES. THIS EXTINCTION HAS BEEN SPED UP. NOW THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS TO BE A REPORT AS WELL. BY WORKING TOGETHER OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED A LOT NUMBER ONE. WE TURNED THAT TURNED BACK THE PROPOSAL TO RAISE LANDING FEES IN SOME CASES BY THIRTEEN THOUSAND PERCENT. AND I WANNA TAKE MOMENT SAY THANK YOU TO THE FLEET FOR YOUR MOBILIZATION LAST YEAR FOR STANDING STRONG AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU. ATTRIBUTE FOR DIRECTOR BOTTOMS WORK ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE. AND OTHER WILL NOT BE IN HIS CHAIR THRONE THIS YEAR SO THEY TRULY ADDRESS ABOUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. NEVER TO WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT TO ENSURE EFFICIENT WHILE LIFE WILL IMPLEMENT FISHERY BY FISHERY BUDGETING. THIS WILL ENSURE TRANSPARENCY ON HOW EACH FISHERY IS THE SAME THING WE ALSO WANT TO TO GOVERNOR BROWN AND SECRETARY LAYERED THAT DAY HAVE BEEN SHOUTING LOUD AND PROUD ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S. CRAB FISHING FLEET IN THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN WITHOUT THE SECRETARY WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR AS WELL AS GOVERNOR BROWN FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORKING THIS GIVE THEM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS WELL PLEASE. OUR NEXT FOCUS HAS BEEN ON SALMON SARDINE IN SEA URCHINS. WE HAVE WRITTEN A GOVERNOR REQUESTS THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE TO CALL FOR A DECLARATION OF THE SALMON SARDINE IN SEA URCHIN FISHERY DISASTER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE GOVERNOR SUPPORTED THESE REQUESTS AND WE AWAIT THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE RESPONSES. THESE WILL ALSO REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL FUNDING. IN AS WE KNOW THESE DAYS CAN BE A BIT TOUGH BUT I KNOW THAT WE WILL NOT STOP WORKING UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO BRING HOME THOSE DOLLARS TO HELP OUR FISHING COMMUNITY CAN THRIVE. AND NUMBER FOUR LAST YEAR WE WERE QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING FISHERY RELATED LEGISLATION SEVEN BILLS WERE PASSED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WHICH WILL BENEFIT CALIFORNIA'S FISH FISHING INDUSTRY. SUCH AS SJR SEVEN WHICH PROVIDES A CLEAR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO PROTECT AND RESTORE SALMON IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE BENEFIT OF COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL AND TRAVEL FISHERIES. SP EIGHT OR NINE WHICH SUPPORTS THE STATE AQUA CULTURE PROGRAM WITH CONTINUED FUNDING IN EIGHTY NINE OR FOR WHICH ALLOWS A LOBSTER FISHERMEN TO FORM A LOBSTER COMMISSION. THIS YEAR AS WE LOOK AHEAD WE'VE INTRODUCED WITH VICE CHAIR STONE THE FISHING ON THIS BILL WHICH WILL CONTINUE FUNDING FOR THE COMMERCIAL SAME INSTANT PROGRAMS IT CLARIFIES AND SIMPLIFIES. THE INTRO THE HARVEST IN HUMBLE BAY ALL THIS AS WE LIKE TO CALL WILD WEST. FOR TODAY'S HEARING GOT WELL AGAIN WE COULD NOT BE MORE EXCITED THAT ALL OF YOU ARE HERE TODAY. WE ENCOURAGE SPEAKERS AND NOT ONLY IDENTIFY PROBLEMS BUT ALSO ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL HELP OUR FISHERMEN STAY AFLOAT. AND EXPEDITE RECOVERY OF OUR FISHERIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WITHOUT FURTHER ADO I'D LIKE TO BETTER TURN IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER STONE. AND ALSO TO LIKE TO TAKE MOM TO WELCOME THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY MISTER DALI. THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE. MISTER DALI HAS BEEN AN ABSOLUTE CHAMPION FOR THE FISHING FLEET AND WE'RE GRATEFUL HAT HE'S JOINED US LET'S TURN IT OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR PHONE INTERNET OVER THE REPUBLICAN Â¸DER COMMENTS MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HIGHLY SORT OF FOR THE. CANDY THAT YOU ALWAYS BRING TO THESE HEARINGS AND I'M SORRY THAT I MISSED THE DINNER LAST NIGHT IS REALLY ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR YEAR TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE.

REALLY PLEASED TO BE ACTUALLY ON THE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN COMING FOR AWHILE AND NOW I'M OFFICIALLY HERE AND THEY MADE ME VICE CHAIR NOT SURE QUITE HOW THAT HAPPENED BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND. AND THIS COMMITTEE AND AS WE LOOK TO THE HARD WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE CONTINUE TO BE DONE THIS YEAR. THIS COMMITTEE THIS. STRENGTH OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE MORE THAT THAT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ALL OF THE STAKE HOLDERS AND THE FISHING INDUSTRY. HELPS US HAVE A CONSISTENT APPROACH TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE RAISED HERE AS WE'RE. GOING TO SWITCH ADMINISTRATIONS THIS NEXT YEAR AND IN ORDER TO NOT LOSE TRACK WE NEED TO BE MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE SETTING UP. POLICY AND CONVERSATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR AS WELL.

I LOOK FORWARD TO A GOOD HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH SURPRISE SURE IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN WELCOME. MR LEADER. HE WAS CHAIRMAN AND THE MEMBERS AND STAFF AND. I JUST WANT TO SAY. THIS IS THE ONLY COMMITTEE I HAVE NOW BYE BYE AS TO ASSUME THE LEADERSHIP ROLE OF THE REPUBLICANS I. THEY TOOK ALL MY CRAZY BUT I REQUESTED I STAY ON THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY POOR TO MY DISTRICT. AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE WATER THAT COMES OUT THIS YEAR'S. COMES FROM FROM THEN UP IN THE NORTH OF MY DISTRICT IN. PERCEPTION OF WATERS AND IT'S CRITICAL TO. MAKE SURE HABITAT IS STRONG INTO. ALSO GETS OUT TO THE OCEAN AND THAT WE TAKE KNOWS OF A PLACE THAT'S FIT TO COME BACK SO I'M I WAS DOWN THIS COMMITTEE AS LONG AS THEM YOU ALLOWED ME TO BE HERE AND. OVER TO THE DIALOGUE I DON'T THINK SO MUCH STRONGLY WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY. MY FINAL THANK YOUS TO ALL OF YOU FOR ALL THE WORK LAST NIGHT AT THE DINNER IS THE VICE CHAIR AND SAID.

IN IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS THE FLEET AND I WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU TO HIM I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE IS WHAT. SO WITHOUT FURTHER DO WE LIKE TO BE A TO BRING UP. THESE FANTASTIC ALL STARS AND OUR AGENCY LEADERS WERE GONNA HEAR FROM JOHN LAYERED TO SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES WORKING HERE FROM MR BONHAM THE DIRECTOR OF CAFFEINE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. WE'RE ALSO EXCITED FOR HIS FIRST TIME TO BE A C. ANTHONY WILLIAMS HERE TODAY HE'S VICE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WE WELCOME YOU ALL CHAIRMAN TO BE A COME FORWARD. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S FISHING FLEET. MY COMING FORWARD. AND AGAIN JUST CANNOT SAY THANK YOU ENOUGH TO MISTER LAYARD WHO. HAS BEEN SUCH A CHAMPION FOR ESPECIALLY ARE CRAP FLEET. TRYING TO SECURE THOSE DOLLARS THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I HAVE TO RACE OUT OF HERE WHEN I'M DONE TALKING AND SO. ON APOLOGIZE FOR. HAVING TO DO THAT AND I WANT TO ALSO SAY I CANNOT THINK OF A TIME. THAT I MISSED THE DINNER HAD A AND. WHITE'S KNIGHT WAS. THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF A MAJOR ENERGY BILL THAT THE THEN SPEAKER NOT CO AUTHORED THAT THAT THEY HAD TIED US DOWN SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE HERE IN THE CAPITAL I WAS HOPING TO GET THERE. AND I WAS HOPING TO GET THERE NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE GREAT FOOD AND A GOOD CAMARADERIE. BUT BECAUSE I CEDED TO DIRECTOR BONHAM. OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE FEATHER RIVER HATCHERY SALMON PACKAGE WHICH I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING. AND JUST FOR THE TWO PEOPLE. THAT ARE SITTING BEHIND ME THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THERE. LET ME SAY THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO KEEP THE DATA STREAMS GOING AROUND THE SALMON FISHERIES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES COMMITTED AND IT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT. TO FUNDING THE SALMON TUGGING AT THE FEATHER RIVER HATCHERY. AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF. THE D. W. R. DIRECTOR CARLA NEMESIS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH US DIRECTOR BONHAM. WE'RE NOT GOING TO MISS A BEAT ON THE SALMON TAGGING AND WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COLLECT THE. THE CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR SALMON MANAGEMENT AND I KNOW IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO MANY OF OUR. COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL TRIBAL FISHERMAN AND A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW PEOPLE ARE COORDINATING AND I'M GLAD TO COME TO A ROOM FULL FISHMAN. WORKS DONE AND THEY ARE NOT ASKING ME WHEN IT'S GOING TO BE DONE BUT SO FAR. OUT OF THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK AND THEY KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING TO WORK VERY VERY GRATEFUL. VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR. AND THEN ALSO I DID NOT WISH TO ONCE IN OUR ONE OF THESE HEARINGS. THAT THE TIME I GOT TO KNOW SEE GREATER VERY WELL WAS BOTH OF US FIGHTING OFF SHORE OIL IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES ME AS A MATTER OF HIM AND HIS ROLE OF OF DECADES AND. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THAT HE IS NOT AT OUR SIDE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FIGHT OF BECAUSE HE WAS SO INSTRUMENTAL. IN IT IN THAT TIME BUT I THINK THAT I WOULD JUST REITERATE. THAT. WE ARE. A. CLEAR. THAT. THE STATE IS CLEAR AGAINST THIS PROPOSAL WERE OPPOSED TO IT WE WILL PRESS THAT POSITION IN ANY VENUE. OF THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PRESS IT AND IT COMES FROM IN TWO THOUSAND SIX TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE GOVERNORS OF CALIFORNIA OREGON AND WASHINGTON. ALL SENT JOINT LETTERS TO THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS IN OPPOSITION. TO THIS IN EARLY JANUARY OF THE WEST COAST GOVERNORS ARE ISSUED A STATEMENT. AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED A RESOLUTION. ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE IS THE NEW ASSEMBLY REPRESENTATIVE AND A PARTICIPATED IN THAT. FARM AND I THINK THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROPOSALS PREMISED ON A PERSPECTIVE THAT ALL THINGS ARE EQUAL BUT NOT ALL CLOSE ARE ALIKE. AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT DROP OFFS ON THE HONOR CONTINENTAL SHELF WEATHER PATTERNS SHIPPING LINES FISHERIES MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. AND. NO WE DID THE FIRST TIME WE FOUGHT IT WE WERE ONLY FIFTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OUT FROM THE MAJOR SPILL. AND WE HAVE TO REMIND PEOPLE. OF JUST HOW DISASTROUS THAT WAS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS DO NOT SUPPORT THIS OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN ANY SURVEY. THAT HAS BEEN. TAKEN AND WE HAVE AS A STATE WITH POLICY REALLY MOVED. AWAY FROM THE WHOLE NOTION OF FOSSIL FUELS AND TRYING TO DO RENEWABLES. IT WHEN I WAS FIGHTING THIS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES I ALWAYS SAID THAT. IF WE JUST IMPROVED BY ONE MILE PER GALLON THE FUEL EFFICIENCY OF CARS IN CALIFORNIA IT WOULD EQUAL THE AMOUNT OF OIL THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT OFF THE COAST. WHAT WE HAVE DONE THAT AND AND EXPONENTIALLY AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND SO I DON'T THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE? DISCOUNTED IN ALL THIS AND I SHOULD ALSO SAY THAT. WHEN. SECRETARY OF INTERIOR APPEARED TO GIVE FLORIDA A PASS. FROM THE DRAWINGS ARE FAR GOVERNOR GOT ON THE PHONE WITH HIM WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. AND DEPRESSED THE SAME CASE FOR CALIFORNIA. AND HE AGREED TO COME VISIT. AN INTERESTING WAY THE DAY THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR CHOSE TO BE IN THE CAPITAL. WAS OCEAN'S TODAY BECAUSE I WENT TO FROM THE MEETING WITH THE GOVERNOR AND HIM TO OCEANS DAY AND THE GOVERNOR JUST PRESSED HIM IN PERSON. WHY IT WAS DIFFERENT WHY HE HAD TO DO THIS AND WAS RELENTLESS IN HIS INTERPERSONAL? A PUSH ON THIS SO JUST TRUST US. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT AND I KNOW THAT I SUBMITTED A LETTER. ON FEBRUARY SEVENTH THERE'LL BE OTHER LETTERS COMING BEFORE THE DEADLINE TOMORROW IF I CAN SHAMELESSLY SAY IF THERE'S A PERSON SITTING BEHIND ME THAT HASN'T WRITTEN OR LETTER YET TOMORROW IS THE DEADLINE AND GO HOME TO YOUR HOTEL. LIGHTED TONIGHT TO ADVENTURE GETS THERE. SO THAT THEY HAVE THE FULL. WITH WEIGHT OF WHAT CALIFORNIA REALLY BELIEVES. A FEW OTHER THINGS BECAUSE YOU HAVE GREAT WITNESSES ARE COMING AFTER ME THAT WILL GO INTO DEPTH AND MANY THINGS. BUT I WANT TO MENTION THAT. THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL HAS ACTIVELY INVESTED OVER TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN INNOVATIVE PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES. THAT AIM TO ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CALIFORNIA FISHERIES. AND. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA DUNGEON THIS CRAB FISHING GEAR WORKING GROUP. WHICH IS A VERY DIVERSE GROUP AND IT'S COME TOGETHER TO CHALLENGE. REDUCING THE RISK OF WYO ENTANGLEMENTS AND AND FISHING GEAR IT SEEKS TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS WE INVESTED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THAT GROUP. ALONE. AND. WE HAVE ALSO APPROVED ADDITIONAL MONEY SUPPORTING TO SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES PROJECTS. TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF STATE FISHERIES AND WHEN THE. M. M. P. A. AS OPPOSED TO THE M. L. P. A FORCE IN ACTED. IT REALLY SET UP A PROCESS FOR LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL FISHERIES. AND THAT COST IN THE FIRST THREE TO SIX THAT WERE DONE SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF. NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO A MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT IS THE REASON THERE ARE THIRTY THAT ARE ON DON. AND SO WE IN JANUARY AT OUR MEETINGS. BUNDLED THOSE REMAINING THIRTY TO GATHER AND APPROPRIATED MONEY TO TRY TO DO THE FIRST STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUALLY. DONE. AND. JUST SO YOU KNOW. ARE KEY FINDINGS FROM OUR SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM. ARE REPORTED ON EMERGING RESEARCH ON THE CAPACITY OF SEA GRASS. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY DOCUMENT THE SCIENCE IN RELATION TO WHAT MIGHT WORK IN A. THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM AND KNOW THAT THERE'S DOCUMENTED SCIENCE THAT MIGHT MAKE OCEANS. HAVE A PLACE IN THAT AT SOME POINT. ON MARCH TWENTY SECOND TWENTY THIRD AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM OTHER PEOPLE. OF THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WILL CO HOST A WORKSHOP WITH THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST. THE INTER AGENCY HARM FOR A BONE TASKFORCE. FOCUSED ON HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. AND. THIS WORKSHOP WILL FOCUS ON TO MORE CASTED IN MONITORING IN THE OCEAN AS IT RELATES TO SEE FOOD SAFETY. I JUST SAY IN CLOSING THAT WE ARE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FAT THAT WE HAVE TEN MONTHS LEFT. AND WE ARE TRYING TO. MAKE SURE WE GET MONEY OUT THE DOOR A DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS INSTITUTIONALIZED DIFFERENT PROBLEMS FIXED. SO THAT WHEN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION COMES IN OF THERE IS A CLEAR DIRECTION ON A NUMBER OF THESE PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH WHEN THEY WALK IN THE DOOR SO. THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY FOR OPENING COMMENTS AND AND BEFORE I GO I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF YOU HAD ANY THANK YOU SO MUCH BEFORE WE GO TO OUR NEXT. TO THE KEYNOTE SPEAKERS LET'S OPEN UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR THE SECTOR IS HE HAS. ANOTHER INDICATION THAT HE HAS TO GET TO TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I THINK HE'S MUCH SECTOR. REALLY GREAT PLEASURE HERE CHANCE TO BE HERE. EVERY YEAR SO VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. JIM WE'RE NOT GONNA BE TURNED OVER TO CHECK ON HIM THAT DIRECTOR CAPPING DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. HE IS GOING TO BE GIVING US AN UPDATE ON THE BUDGET THAT HE HAS SOME GOOD NEWS TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER TODAY. ALSO ON ALL ISSUES OF WAILING TALE ENTANGLEMENT. TALKING ABOUT SP EIGHT TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN THAT THE FLEET ALL SUPPORTED IN ADVANCE IS WELL. IN THEN WE'LL BE TOUCHING ON FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE. WE WELCOME THE DIRECTOR TO THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK THEY COULD SHARE VICE CHAIR MISTER LEADER. CRAB TRAP. AND. MAYBE THE ONLY TIME I GET A CHANCE TO SAY THAT HEARING. HELLO MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I STILL THINK THAT THE GREATEST JOB IN THE WORLD WHICH IS SOMETHING I ALWAYS SAY AS DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE. YOU WROTE ME ON THE TWENTY HIRD OF FEBRUARY YOU ASKED ME TO COVER THOSE FIVE ITEMS. IN FIFTEEN MINUTES. INSTEAD OF STARTING WITH WHICH YOU LABEL GOOD NEWS THE BUDGET I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WAS LAST YEAR AND BEGIN WITH. THE MARINE LIFE MANAGEMENT ACT MASTER PLAN TOPIC. SO AS MOST FOLKS KNOW AND NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE STATE ENACTED THE MARINE LIFE MANAGEMENT ACT. AND PRETTY SHORTLY THEREAFTER. IN TWO THOUSAND ONE I THINK THE STATE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST MASTER PLAN. FOR GOVERNANCE WITHIN THAT. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS OUR DEPARTMENT WITH COMMISSION LEADERSHIP ARE VARIOUS PARTNERS IN TRIBES. ARE UNENDING THAT MASTER PLAN. AND HERE'S WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. SO WE SPENT ABOUT TWO YEARS THROUGH THAT COLLABORATIVE DIALOGUE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE COMMISSION'S PUBLIC PROCESS. AND I THINK THIS WILL BE A FROM THE COMMISSION IN JUNE. AND THAT'LL SET US UP FOR IMPLEMENTATION WE'VE HAD INVOLVEMENT BY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITIES FISHING COMMUNITIES. AND IT WILL LAY OUT A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO ASSESS OUR STATE MANAGED OCEAN FISHERIES. AND THEN GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF DESIGNING THE SUSTAINABILITY PLANS FOR THOSE FISHERIES. BUT IT DOES SOMETHING NEW. THE EXISTING LAW REALLY EMPHASIZES FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLANS WHICH CAN BE A LENGTHY PROCESS THEY'RE IMPORTANT BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN OR SO FISHERIES UNDER THAT PLANNING EFFORT. THIS AMENDMENT CREATES A NEW I THINK INNOVATIVE ASPECT WHERE. THERE MAY BE SOME FISHERIES WE CAN DO ENHANCE STATUS REPORTS ABOUT. DO THE ANALYSIS ANALYSIS FASTER UNDERSTAND THEIR STATUS FASTER AND THEN THAT'LL BECOME A PIVOT POINT DECIDE IF YOU NEED A FULL FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLAN OR SOME MORE ABBREVIATED LIGHTER VERSION BASED ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN THE SCIENCE. SO WITH THE SOME MEN THAT WE EXPECT THAT BY EARLY TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BUT A YEAR LATER WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE DONE ABOUT THIRTY SIX OF THOSE IN HAND STATUS REPORTS FOR STATE BASS FISHERIES WHICH CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE ANY ANALYSIS AROUND THEM. FOR THEIR LONG TERM MANAGEMENT. SO THAT'S THE FIRST CATEGORY. THE SECOND TOPIC YES ME TALK ABOUT. ALL THINGS WHALES. THIS TAKES A MOMENT TO PAUSE. AND A KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF ENGAGE. COMPONENTS OF OUR CITIZENRY ON THIS TOPIC. THE FLEET IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED OUR CONSERVATION COMMUNITY. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THERE'S A SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT SHARED VALUES. NOBODY WANTS TO UNTANGLE AWAY ALL. AND I THINK THAT RUNS ACROSS THE SIGHT SEEING THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS THEN YEAH INDUSTRY COMMUNITIES. JUST SO YOU KNOW. WE ARE UNDER ACTIVE LITIGATION. THE DEPARTMENT'S BEEN SUED IN FEDERAL COURT. BY THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. AND MOST RECENTLY. THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS HAVE MOVED INTERVENE IN THAT FEDERAL LITIGATION. SO THAT'S HAPPENING. IN ONE'S FEAR. BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT UNDER WAY. TO GET AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM FOR A COUPLE EARS. THROUGH OUR DUNGEON IS CRAP WORK GROUP. THERE IS A STRUCTURE. I BELIEVE THERE IS A SET OF SHARED VALUES AND OBJECTIVES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED BETWEEN STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY. THOSE INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRANSPARENCY. PROCESS. INFORMATION SHARING. ELECTRONIC MONITORING. AROUND THIS ISSUE PERHAPS GEAR MARKING. AND THEN. WHAT IS CALLED RAMP A RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM? WHICH IS A LAY PERSON IN MY MIND I PACKAGE IT THIS WAY. POSSIBLY AS AN ANALOGY SOMETHING LIKE A GREEN YELLOW RED. RISK ESCALATION DIAGRAM. AND IF WE CAN FOSTER AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE INDUSTRY AND STAKE HOLDERS ARE ENGAGED IN THAT TYPE OF PROCESS. THE SEGUE BETWEEN COLORS IS DEFINED BY OBJECTIVE SCIENTIFIC METRICS. AND AS YOU MOVE UP YOUR SLIDE YOUR YOUR RISK METER. KING ABOUT COLLABORATIVE ACTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK AND EVENTUALLY PERHAPS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT RESTRICTIVE ACTIONS. THAT'S ON TOPIC WELL. ENGAGED IN THIS WORKING GROUP IT'S REFLECTED I THINK IN YOUR OMNIBUS BILL. AND WHAT'S NEXT I THINK IS FOR THE PARTIES TO. CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION SEE IF WE CAN'T PRODUCE AN OUTCOME. THAT WILL REDUCE THE RISK OF. ENTANGLEMENTS BY WAILING OR FIXED GEAR FISHERIES IN STATE WATERS. IT'S B. TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN IS YOUR LEADERSHIP TO THINK ABOUT A PART OF THIS CHALLENGE AND THAT'S GEAR LEFT IN WATER ABANDON OR DERELICT. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN AUTHORING THAT BILL. BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IN THE CURRENT OMNIBUS YOU'VE TRIED TO FINE TUNE. THINGS TO HELP IMPLEMENTATION BE MORE SUCCESSFUL. THE DEPARTMENTS I THINK ABLE TO COME TO YOU AND TALK ABOUT A FEW FURTHER REFINEMENTS. WE THINK WE'RE CLOSE ON THAT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND WERE ALSO VERY WILLING TO ADOPT YOUR INSTRUCTION THAT WITHIN ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW WE'VE GONE AHEAD AND DONE THE IMPLEMENTING RULE MAKING. TO MAKE IT A REALLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION. AND A LOT OF GREAT CONCERN AROUND WELL ENTANGLEMENT. BUT I'M OF THE VIEW WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN THE MIDDLE FACILITATING THIS CONVERSATION I THINK WE CAN GET ALL THE MAJOR STAKE HOLDERS TO A COMMON OUTCOME. I'M HOPEFUL FOR THAT. LET ME RUN THROUGH AN UPDATE ON THE SALMON SARDINE INTERACTION FISHERIES THE CHEST FOR. THERE'S GOOD AND BAD NEWS. ON THE SAME IN FRONT I'D SAY THERE'S A TOUCH OF GOOD NEWS BUT THERE'S ALSO BAD NEWS. SO LAST WEEK OUR SCIENTISTS COMPLETED THE STOCK FORECASTS FOR THE SACRAMENTO IN THE KLAMATH FALLS CHINOOK. AND THESE FORECASTS ARE WHAT BECOME THE BASIS TO DETERMINE THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FISHING SEASONS. SO THE FORECAST FOR THE SALMON FALL RUN IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO LAST YEAR. ABOUT FORECASTS THESE ARE MODELS THATTAKE A SKATE MEN IN NUMBERS AND PROJECT WHAT WE THINK WE'LL SEE. AND THEN THAT GUIDES WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO ALLOCATE FOR CATCHING HARVEST. SO IN THE SACRAMENTO IT'S A PROJECTION OF TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND ADULTS WHICH IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO LAST YEAR. IN THE KLAMATH FALL RUN STOCK THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE THERE MIGHT BE SOME GOOD NEWS. NUMBER IT IS RELATIVE BECAUSE IT WAS SO ABYSMAL THE PRIOR SEASON. BUT IT IS MUCH IMPROVED WITH A FORECAST OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CHINOOK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WIN LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND. ADULTS SO THAT'S A MARKET INCREASE I DO THINK THAT SOME GOOD NEWS. HERE'S THE LESS GOOD NEWS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA AS THEY ARE EXPRESSED IN THE FEDERAL MANAGEMENT PLANS. IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT BOTH OF THESE TARGETS STOCKS. YOU MAY QUALIFY FOR THE FEDERAL DEFINITION OF OVER FISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS WEEK AT THE PACIFIC FISHERIES MANAGEMENT COUNCIL RUNNER PARK IS THE BEGINNING OF A DISCUSSION WHICH WILL END IN. IT WAS A JUNE IN PORTLAND. AND WILL DETERMINE WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO BE FINISHED OR NOT IN BOTH THOSE FISHERIES. SARDINE I WOULD SAY IS CONTINUED BADNESS. SO IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN NOT FOR FOURTH YEAR IN A ROW YOU'LL SEE NO FISHING FOR OUR STARTING FISHER. AND THE REASON IS THE PROJECTED SARDINE STOCK BIOMASS IS WELL BELOW THE SET LIMITS. FOR THIS FISHERY. SO WE'RE PROJECTING THE BIO MASS AT FIFTY ABOUT FIFTY TWO THOUSAND METRIC TONS. AND THE LIMIT IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS THAT'S HOW FAR BELOW THE LIMIT WE ARE. AND I THINK JUST TODAY THE FEDERAL COUNCIL AND THE NATIONALLY FISHERIES SERVICE. HAVE PUT OUT ADDITIONAL DATA SUGGESTING THAT. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THIS STARTING FISHERY IS DECLINED BY NINETY. SEVEN PERCENT. SO SOME OF THE BIOLOGICAL WORLD IS COMPARING IT TO THE COLLAPSE OF THE CANNERY ROW FISHERY. THEIR VARIETY OF FACTORS AND I THINK THAT'S MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION NEXT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE PRIME FACTORS AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. VIRGIN ABALONE NORTH COAST HELP I WOULD PUT AS ONE. IN DECEMBER AS MANY KNOW OUR COMMISSION CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN READ ABALONE SEASON BASED ON A COLLAPSE. THE COLLAPSE IS REALLY TRIGGERED BY I THINK THAN FAVORABLE OCEAN CONDITIONS LARGE SCALE REGIME SHIFT. AND BASICALLY A LOSS OF ARE KILLED FARCE. WHICH SHOWS THE LOUD LESS PREFERABLE VIRGINS TO TAKE OVER THE LANDSCAPE BIRBAL NOTABLY. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO THE COMMISSION IS FORCING THE DEPARTMENT APPROPRIATELY TO DO. IS UPDATE THE ABALONE READ EYE BELOW THE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT PLAN. IT'S OUTDATED WE NEED TO GET IT UPDATED WITH NEW SCIENCE AND WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT. BUT IT'S VERY LIKELY IF NOT CERTAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE LIMITED URCHIN FISHERY OPPORTUNITIES STILL. I THINK ON THE UPSIDE I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE'VE GOT CRAB OPEN. WE GOT IT OPEN IN THE HOLIDAYS. AND WE SEEM TO HAVE AVOIDED A SIMILAR DIM DRAMATIC ACID CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD A COUPLE YEARS PRIOR. EVEN THOUGH IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL KEEP POSTING THE SCIENTIFIC WORKSHOPS ONE LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE NEXT MONTH. HE. FORCING US TO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION OF DEMO GAS IT AND HOW WE MANAGE IT IN FUTURE CYCLES. AQUA CULTURE PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. A MOUTHFUL. NOT MANY OF THE ROOM PROBABLY UNDERSTAND OR TALKING ABOUT I THINK YOU DO. I DON'T BELIEVE IT SHOULD TAKE TEN PLUS YEARS FOR AN AGENCY TO COMPLETE AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WHICH IS WHY THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO GET IT DONE FINALLY. SO WE'RE GOING TO COMMIT THE FINANCIAL STAFF RESOURCES TO COMPLETE THE DRAFT GET OUT OUT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THAT'LL BE A HUGE SHIFT. NEEDS TO GET DONE IT SHOULD'VE BEEN DONE A LONG TIME AGO. SO WE'LL BE POSTING A REFRESH REFRESH NOTICE OF PREPARATION LATE THIS MONTH WE'RE GONNA GO OUT TO PUBLIC SCOPING MEETINGS BOTH IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND WE GONNA LAY OUT THIS TIME LINE. TO GET THAT DRAFT UP TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION AND I'M POTENTIALLY DON. UNDERSCORE POTENTIALLY AS DIRECTOR THIS CALENDAR YEAR. OKAY SO. YOU SAID THE. GOOD NEWS IN YOUR LETTER TO ME. LET ME TRY TO END ON A GOOD NEWS NOW. FIRST BY TELLING YOU SOMETHING I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW YET. THIS WEEK WE ARE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THE DEPARTMENT'S FOURTH SOLICITATIONS UNDER PROPOSITION ONE. FOR GRANTS WHICH WAS THE WATER BOND THAT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS VOTED YES FOR. OVERALL IN THE PRIOR THREE GRAND CYCLES WE'VE GRANTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED AND TWELVE PROJECTS. FORTY ONE PERCENT OF THAT RESTORATION GRANTING HAS BEEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF SAM AND STILL AT. WE'VE RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY SIX APPLICATIONS. FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WORK. BUT HERE'S WHAT'S NEW RIGHT NOW. WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ONE SOLICITATION GONNA BREAK IN HALF. WE'RE GONNA SPRING SOLICITATION WHICH WILL RELEASE THIS WEEK WHY. WE HINK WE CAN FOCUS ON A COUPLE OF LITTLE THINGS. ASK ONLY FOR IMPLEMENTATIONS SHOVEL READY PROJECTS AND TURN DIRT FASTER. AND IN THE FALL WILL DO A SUBSEQUENT SOLICITATION MORE OF THE ACQUISITION THE PLANNING. TYPE WORK. HERE'S WHY SPRINGS IMPORTANT. ONE OF THE EMPHASIS WE'RE ASKING FOR IS WILDLIFE. AND WILD FIRES RECOVERY. SO WE WILL ASK PEOPLE TO COME TO US WITH APPLICATIONS FOR PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT FISH. ALSO DEAL WITH THE RHODESIAN. IN OUR. WILDFIRE. IMPACTED LANDSCAPES. RIPARIAN HABITAT WORK. WATER QUALITY WORK AND POSE FAR SUSSMAN'S WHICH CAN BE PLANNING FOR SUBSEQUENT WORK. AT THESAME TIME WE'LL ASK PEOPLE TO COME TO US FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON RESILIENCY PROJECTS. IF YOU GOT A FISH SCREENED THE SUNSCREEN IN NEED SCREENING IF YOU GOT A BURIED A MIGRATION. IF YOU WANT TO DO REARING HABITAT BY FLOODING UP YOUR LAND SURFACE CAN GET ON AND GET FATTER. IF YOU GOT PASSAGE PROBLEMS IN YOUR FRONT CONTROL PROJECTS COME TO US WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SPECIAL SOLICITATION FOR THOSE TWO TOPICS IN THE SPRING. SINCE AT LEAST THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. IT'S BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED THE DEPARTMENT SINGLE BIGGEST CHALLENGES SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. ACTUALLY HAVE A REAL POOR NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. THE JOINT COMMITTEE. BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS LEGISLATURE ASKED BOOZE ALLEN HAMILTON A NATIONAL CONSULTING FIRM. TO LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEIR ANSWER WAS SUSTAINABLE FUNDING NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. I'VE GOT THROUGH A COUPLE. BRUTAL BUDGET CYCLES ISN'T THE QUITTING LAST YEAR. AND I AM THRILLED TO ACKNOWLEDGE GOVERNOR BROWN'S LEADERSHIP IN HIS JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL WHERE HE PROPOSES FIFTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING PERMANENT. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. TO THIS HEARING. THAT'S. ALLOCATED. AMONG OTHER ITEMS THIS WAY ALMOST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR SALMON WORK. AT ABOUT NINETEEN NEW POSITIONS. ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOUR HATCHERY WORKED TO BUILD BETTER TECHNOLOGIES INTO OUR HATCHERIES. ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS FOR OUR MARINE OCEAN WORK. HAS THIRTY EIGHT POSITIONS. WE AS AN EXAMPLE. DEAL WITH SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMMERCIAL LANDING RECEIPTS AND LOG BOOKS ANNUALLY WE PRINT THEM WE MAIL THEM IN WE MANUALLY ENTER THEM INTO A DATA SYSTEM. WHEN IT FLIPPED OUT OVER TO INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY. THERE'S ABOUT TWO POINT SIX MILLION SET ASIDE IN THIS PROPOSAL FOR THAT MASTER PLAN WORK I DESCRIBED EARLIER. THERE'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SET ASIDE INTO PERMANENT POSITIONS TO CREATE WHAT I BELIEVE WILL BE THE NATION'S MOST PROGRESSIVE WAY UNTANGLE MEANT RISK REDUCTION MITIGATION PROGRAM. SO THE BENEFITS ARE REAL TO THOSE IN THIS ROOM TODAY. IN MY VIEW IS THERE'S VERY LITTLE DISPUTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT STRUGGLES WITH SUSTAINABLE FUNDING. IT'S CREDIBLE PROPOSAL OTHER FORD NEXT WEEK STARTING THE HEARING PROCESS ON THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL NOT STOP THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A DIRECTOR GRATEFUL AT THE TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I'D SAY A COUPLE QUESTIONS SO UNDERSTAND JUMP BACK TO YOUR FIRST PART ABOUT AT TWELVE THIRTY SEVEN AND. IN WITHIN THE ON THIS BILL SO DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WILL BE PROVIDING. LANGUAGE OF POTENTIAL TWEAKS. TO BE ABLE TO TO GET THAT MOVED YES THAT'S GREAT WANNA CONFIRM THE STATISTIC THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT THE NINETY SEVEN PERCENT DECREASE. IN THIRTEEN THIRTEEN. ASIAN IS THAT JUST IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WEST COAST ITS MEXICO TO. ITS RIGHTFUL RANGE WIDE AS I UNDERSTAND IN MEXICO TO BRITISH COLUMBIA EXCLUDED AND I THINK IT'S BENCHMARKED AGAINST TWO THOUSAND AND SIX. AND TWO THOUSAND SIX MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE HIGHEST. LAST YEAR LIKE IT WAS THROUGH THE ROOF RECORD BOSS. SO YOU NEED TO THINK THROUGH THOSE. PARAMETERS OF THE ANALYSIS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY. TALK ABOUT THAT SO THE WILDFIRE RECOVERY WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND JUST. DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU THE TRACTOR ONE. RIGHT IN THE THICK OF ALL ISSUES THE NORTH A FIRESTORM CALLED UP AND MAKE SURE THAT. KITTEN THE RESOURCES WE NEEDED AT ON HIS SIDE. DO YOU SEE THIS AS A ONE TIME TALK ABOUT HOW YOU SEE THIS GOING OUT BECAUSE THE. ESSENTIALLY NOT APPARENT REASON HERE PLANNING GRANTS. I DO HAVE TO GET THAT PROJECTS PREPARED. IN IN DOLLARS SHE ACTUALLY DO HABITAT RESTORATION WITHIN. STREAM BANKS WATERSHEDS EXEDRA. IS IS TO INTERPRET DISCO SECOND YEAR IF YOU'RE DOING A PLANNING GRANT TO BETTER SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDS. WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT. I DON'T HAVE AN OPINION TO EXPRESS ON THE OUT YEARS YEAH YEAH WE'VE NOT TRIED. EARLIER TARGETED SOLICITATION LIKE THIS EXCEPT FOR DROUGHT YEAH. I'D LIKE TO GAUGE RESPONSE. BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF WE'RE GONNA FUN PLANNING WORK THIS YEAR WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND GOOD PLANNING MAY COME BACK PROJECTS LATER EXACTLY. BUT ALSO SAY WHETHER WE DO IT TARGETED SOLICITATION AGAIN IN YEAR TWO THREE FOUR FIVE. MAY NOT MATTER. THIS WAY BECAUSE THIS WORKS ALL QUALIFYING UNDER PROP ONE GENERALLY SPEAKING. RIGHT A RHODESIAN WORK. IN BANK SETTLEMENT CONTROL WERE PREPARED AND HABITAT PLANTING. ALL ARE PRETTY ELIGIBLE UNDER PROP ONE AS WE HAVE IT SET UP AS OF TODAY ANYWAY. SO LET ME THINK ABOUT. HOW THIS GOES AND I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR? PERMANENCE WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO PROJECTS ON THE LANDSCAPE SCALE LIKE ANY OTHER WAYS THAT RING THAT UP TO EIGHTY EIGHT IN PARTICULAR THIS IS. FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES RIGHT. WOW THERE IS SIGNIFICANT NEED. TO USE MEDICINAL KENNY'S EXAMPLE RIGHT ALONG THE RUSSIAN RIVER THERE. BEING ABLE TO SECURE THESE DOLLARS SO LET'S AS YOU DO THE SOLICITATION SPRING THEY PROBABLY WANNA MEANS BE ABLE TO SEE THE DOLLARS IN THEIR ACCOUNT. MAKING THIS UP MAYBE TO FALL. I SAID THEN YOU'RE INTO THAT NEXT CYCLE THE NEXT YEAR AS TO THE REASON I BRING THAT UP AND BY THE WAY I DON'T DIMINISH. WHAT FANTASTIC NEWS THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS? WONDERFUL AND DESPERATELY NEEDED. DISTINCTION PRACTICALLY ON BANDWIDTH OF SOME OF THESE COUNTIES. AND THEY CAN ALSO WORK WITH CST SIX SAID ROB RIGHT UNDERSTOOD YEAH I ALSO THINK A POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE OF MOVING SOMETHING EARLIER IN SPRING MIGHT BE UNDERSCORE MY. WE GET PEOPLE AND. FIELD CONSTRUCTION SEASON IN A FOLDER. IT IS SAID TO BE A BACK TO OVER FIFTEEN YES SO. IT'S FANTASTIC. HATES WHEN AS A THANK YOU FOR HAT. TARGETED APPROACH BECAUSE IT IS. DESPERATELY NEEDED END LIVING THROUGH THE VALLEY FIRE CLEAN FIRE NOW THIS IS I'M NOT SURE MMHM WHO MANY PEOPLE APPRECIATE. THE OVERLAP BUT AS AN EXAMPLE IN CINEMA COUNTY. MY DEPARTMENT THAT COUNTY SNOW COUNTY WATER AGENCY ROUNDTABLE. MARK WEST CREEK IS AN IDENTIFIED. CORE RECOVERY AREA FOR SALMON IN THE RUSSIAN RIVER. AND IT WAS. RIGHT IN THE FIRE SO THAT'S THAT'S A NEXUS IF YOU WILL OUR THINKING THIS IS A GOOD APPROACH. THANK YOU THAT'S SORT OF BEEN ASKED ABOUT TIMING. BUYERS TO GET ON THE GROUND ACTUALLY. BILL TO GET THERE BEFORE IT. NEXT YEAR'S. RIGHT. YEAH THAT'S GREAT. MUCH TO MANY OTHER ITEMS.

QUITE SOME TIME HE'S GOING TO DISCUSS THE COMMISSION'S PRIORITIES. FOR A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU CAN BE FOCUSING THE PRAYERS BOTH ON THE FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE SIDE.

FOR COMING BACK AND WE CAN BE MORE EXCITED TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE pYOU FOR HAVING ME OF MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND AND. MISTER LEADER IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND. MISTER ROYSTER YOU ASKS THE QUESTION HOW YOU GOT YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW YOU GOT ELECTED. WAS SELECTED AS VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I I I ACTUALLY KNOW HOW I GOT ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT AFFECT CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION I I MISSED THE MEETING PLANNER. BUT THE TIMING WAS GOOD BECAUSE. IT DOES GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY AS MUCH AS I MEAN I'M. VERY THANKFUL TO YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE. AND APPRECIATE THAT I I I REALLY ENJOY THE FACT THAT I GOT TO GO TO LAST NIGHT'S DINNER SO THAT WAS A THAT WAS A GREAT EVENT AND I THINK THANKS EVERYONE FOR.

IN THE INTEREST OF GETTING TO SOME OF THAT I WANNA I WANNA TRY TO BE A LITTLE BIT DISCIPLINE WITH MY REMARKS AND. SO FORGIVE ME FOR GLANCING DOWN HERE A LITTLE BIT I KNOW HOW THAT IS AND IN THE HEARINGS LIKE THIS TO JUST SIT THERE AND WATCH SOMEBODY RE BUT ALL OF THEM. I'LL TRY TO BE AS A AS A EFFICIENT AS I CAN AND THAT SO. HE YOU KNOW IT IT'S IT'S REALLY A PLEASURE. TO TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT AND TO BE HERE TO REPRESENT MART PRESIDENT ERIC SKLAR WHO I AM I KNOW YOU KNOW VERY WELL. BUT ALSO TO BE HERE TO REPRESENT OUR FINE STAFF AT THE COMMISSION UM VALOR TO MANY YEARS ARTS ACTOR DIRECTOR. I'M SUSAN ASHCRAFT TO INTERACTS WITH A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. ON MARINE RELATED ISSUES I THINK THEY'RE BOTH HERE IN THE ROOM SO I JUST WONDERED KNOWLEDGE THEM IN THE STAFF OF THE COMMISSION AT THAT. WITH VERY FEW RESOURCES TO QUITE A LOT OF A WORK ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. MANAGE OUR RESOURCES AND AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE FROM THE REMARKS OF. BOTH SECRETARY IN THE DIRECTOR THAT WERE PART OF A. PRETTY COOL TEAM VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE VERY COMMITTED AND PASSIONATE ABOUT MANAGING OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. YOU KNOW WE ARE AT THE COMMISSION OBVIOUSLY VERY DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT. OUR FISHERMEN IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE COMMUNITIES AND A THRIVING OF FISHERIES HERE IN THE FUTURE. BEGIN I PLEDGE YOU FOR HAVING THIS THIS FORM AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN ADVANCING ISSUES. MANY OF YOU MAY. BE AWARE THAT THAT HE THE CALIFORNIA FISH COMMISSION AT THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION IS ACTUALLY THE OLDEST SUCH COMMISSION IN THE UNITED STATES. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE WILL CELEBRATE A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF AN EXISTENCE. SO WE ARE YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE OF THAT SORT OF HISTORIC. LANDMARK. WE'RE GONNA BE EMBARKING ON. STRATEGIC PLANNING INITIATIVES THAT YOU KNOW WILL ALIGN OUR GOALS TO MORE EFFICIENTLY DRESS ADDRESS THE COMING CHALLENGES INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE IN ME THE THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. COM. THE GOAL IS TO REALLY HAVE THE COMMISSION BE MORE PROACTIVE. RATHER THAN REACTIVE. REGARDING THAT MANY MEN MANDATES THAT THE COMMISSION HAS AGAIN WITH A VERY SMALL STAFF SO PRIORITIZATION IS THE KEYS SO YOU ASK THAT WE TALK ABOUT SOME WHATEVER WHAT OUR PRIORITIES. COMING UP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT NO NEED FOR ME TO REPEAT IT AND THAT IS THE ADMINISTERED THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR OFFSHORE ORAL DEVELOPMENT YOU YOUR. SECRETARY LAYERED LAID OUT THE CASE VERY WELL I DON'T NEED TO REPEAT IT. WHAT I WILL SAY IS YOU KNOW AGAIN AS PART OF BEING THIS THIS TEAM OF NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STATE WE ALSO ACTED WE SENT A LETTER? TO SECRETARY ZEKI OPPOSING THE DRILLING PLAN. AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY JOINING THE GOVERNOR THE SECRETARY AND THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS MANY OTHER STATE AGENCIES ND. AND UNANIMOUSLY OPPOSING THIS EXPANSION. I COULD SAY SIMPLY PUT THE PROPOSAL HAS NO PLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT PUTS AT RISK OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES OUR FISHERIES. AS WELL AS THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR BRAIN ECOSYSTEMS. ANOTHER PRIORITY OF THE COMMISSION IS. YOU KNOW THE FUTURE OF FISHING COMMUNITIES WHICH IS A HUGE HUGE ISSUE THAT WE. HEAR ABOUT HERE AT THE CAMP AT THE COMMISSION. AND AT THE DIRECTION OF THE COMMISSION STAFF DEVELOPED A SERIES OF YOU MENTIONED A COASTAL FISHING COMMUNITIES MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE REGARDING THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND PROSPERITY OF OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES. THE GOALS OF THESE MEETINGS IS TO FIND COMMON THINGS THEMES AND PRIORITIES THAT ARE WITHIN THE COMMISSION'S REAL HOUSE TO ADDRESS EITHER THROUGH BROAD POLICY DEVELOPMENT. REGULATION CHANGE. OR SUPPORT FOR OTHER APPROACHES. THAT FIVE MEETINGS NOW. FROM SMITH RIVER ATASCADERO OF INTER. MONTEREY SAN DIEGO UP AND DOWN THE COAST. ON THEY'LL BE MORE PLANNED. AND WE'VE GOT A SECRET WHO'S STARTING CIGARETTE FELLOW STARTING IN IN LATE MARCH WE'RE PLANNING SOME MORE THOSE MEETINGS. AND ONE OF THE COMMON THEMES THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING IS AT THE CHALLENGE. YOU KNOW OF THE RESTRICTED ACCESS FISHERIES ARE HAVING ON COMMUNITIES IS TOUGH. PRESENTS CHALLENGES FOR FISHERMEN TO A DOT ADAPT TO THE CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS. FOR. INJURY BY NEW A NEW GENERATION OF POTENTIAL FISHERMEN. THE COMMISSION PLANS HER BREATH EMBRACE A POLICY THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF CALIFORNIA FEATURES AS WELL AS AQUA CULTURE. OUT TO CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE SENT A LETTER TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION EMPHASIZING THE NEED TO PRESERVE AND BALANCE ARMORY MARINE HERITAGE. ECONOMY AND. ITS COASTAL AND OCEAN USES. AN IDEAL IS THE POSSIBILITY REFINING THE EXISTING COMMISSION POLICY RESTRICTED ACCESS AND COMMERCIAL FISHERIES TO THINK THROUGH. HOW WE CAN HELP COMMUNITIES BE MORE RESILIENT AS FISHERIES HAVE THE CYCLES YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE ALLAWARE OF? IT WITH THE GOAL TO TO KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES THRIVING WITH A PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS AND STRATEGIES TO ADAPT. LET ME MOVE TO THE NEXT TOPIC BECAUSE AGAIN I WANNA I WANNA HEAR FROM. THE FOLKS WHO HAVE ASSEMBLED SO HALIBUT PERMIT TRANSFERS THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON. IT'S ANOTHER RECENT EXAMPLE OF COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS. IN TERMS OF THE RECENT OMNIBUS BILL RIGHT. WE'VE HEARD THAT BOTH BOTH THE COMMISSION AND THE MARINE RESOURCES COMMITTEE. ABOUT THE ONGOING CONCERN FROM FISHERMEN. REGARDING CONSTRAINTS ON TRANSFERRING THOSE TOUCH ALL VESSELS PERMITS. SOME REAL CHALLENGES FOR FOLKS. WHO WANT TO MODERNIZE THEIR BUSINESS? AND ALSO YOU KNOW WHO SIMPLY WANT TO GET A A NEW ABOUT. SO THE FACT THAT THESE PERMITS TRAVEL WITH THE BOAT AND CAN'T BE TRANSFERRED FROM ONE BOAT TO ANOTHER OWNED BY THE SAME FISHERMEN. UNLESS THERE'S A SPECIFIC IRREPARABLE DAMAGE TO THE VESSEL IS CREATING A LOT OF LET'S SAY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES RIGHT SO. YOU KNOW THE NEURAL PROVISIONS DEFINED IN THE FISHING GAME CODE GOVERNING CONDITIONS ALLOWING FOR THE TRANSFER PERMITS THAT. YEAH THESE ARE IN PLACE UNTIL A pADOPTED OR THERE'S A LEGISLATIVE CHANGE. I'M SO WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE THE INTRODUCTION OF YOUR BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE THAT I THINK WILL ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT. AND THEN FINALLY ISSUED IT TO TOUCH ON IS THE MARINE LIFE MANAGEMENT. ACT THE THE MLM MAY IN THE MASTER PLAN UPDATE IS NEAR COMPLETION AFTER A LONG PROCESS. OVER TWO YEARS ON HOW TO UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES LAW. THAT PLAN SERVES AS A ROAD MAP TO IMPLEMENT THE MLM MAY FIRST WRITTEN ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND UP OBVIOUSLY A LOT'S CHANGED SINCE THEN. WE'VE GOT NEW TOOLS AND STRATEGIES TO BETTER ADDRESS FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND AND THE CHALLENGES WE NEED TO BE MORE ADAPTIVE SO. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GOALS I THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE MASTER PLAN IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH A SHARED SET OF EXPECTATIONS. FOR FISHERIES MANAGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMMISSION DEPARTMENT STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PUBLIC. WITH BOTH THE COMMISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT YOU KNOW WE REALLY MUST PRIORITIZE WHAT TO TACKLE FIRST. IN THE MASTER PLAN HELPS pTHINK THROUGH WHAT SCALE OF MANAGEMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL FISHERIES AND. I'M SO WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING ADOPTING THE DRAFT AND THERE'S STILL TIME BY THE WAY FOR STAKEHOLDERS TO COMMENT ON A PRIOR TO THE COMMISSION'S APRIL MEETING. AND THEY WILL BE TAKEN THAT UP FOR ADOPTION IN JUNE. AND THEN THEN THE REAL WORK BEGINS TO CARRY IT OUT A SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS AND I I'M JUST GONNA ANNOUNCE. UP UP FRONT THAT IF I CAN ANSWER THEM BUT I'VE GOT A CAPABLE STAFF BACK HERE WHO. WHO COME UP AND OUR DIRECTOR VALERIE TO ME FOR SURE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW THINK IT'S TOO MUCH TO VICE PRESIDENT WOULD TAKE? IF WE'VE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS VICE PRESIDENT AGNEW STATISTICS LITTLE MORE. IT DIFFER DIVING CAN LESSEN TWO MINUTES JUST TO GET AN EXTERNAL BUT ON THIS COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND. ONCE YOU'RE ABLE TO COLLECT IT THE DATA WOULD YOU HOPE TO DO WITH IT. YEAH I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE IN AND AGAIN I'LL HAVE OUR EN MINUTES TO WHAT MIGHT COME UP AND AND AND SUPPLEMENT MY RESPONSE WHAT BUT CERTAINLY ARE PLANNED. AT AS YOU KNOW AS WE DID WITH THE COMMISSION ON MANY ISSUES IS TO BRING THAT STAKEHOLDER INPUT TOGETHER. PALM AND THEN TO DEVELOP WHAT WE MIGHT THINK OF AS YOU KNOW SOME REGULATORY OR pPOLICY SUGGESTIONS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED AND AND MOVE SWIFTLY TO TO TO BRING THAT BACK TO THE COMMISSION. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING THOSE AS WELL AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AS I SAID YOU KNOW. AS WE'VE GONE AROUND THE STATE IT'S THERE'S A CRITICAL NEED TO ACT VERY QUICKLY SO WE DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A DRAWN OUT PROCESS WHERE IT'S YOU KNOW YEARS DOWN THE LINE. OF OF CONTINUED IT KIND OF GATHER INPUT BUT WE CERTAINLY WANT TO HAVE THAT INPUT WE WANNA HAVE A PROCESS THAT'S OPEN AND TRANSPARENT. AND AND BUILDS UPON ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE GATHERING. BUT TO BRING THAT TO SOME ACTION RELATIVELY QUICKLY NO THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND WHEN THE SENATE THAT MIKE GUY ANY ANY ITEMS THAT YOU LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADD ON TO WITH THE THE VICE PRESIDENT. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MORTGAGE LENDERS INTRODUCING YOURSELF AND SORRY I'M IN BALLARD TO ME AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMMISSION THANK YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO MORE MEETINGS. BETWEEN EIGHT WOULD SAY. APRIL AND JUNE LOCATED IN FORT BRAGG AND HALF MOON BAY AREA. AND THEN HOPEFULLY WILL CULMINATE ALL OF THOSE MEETINGS AND HAVE A COUPLE KEY THEMES THAT WE'VE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE STATE SHE COULD ACCESS IS THE BIG ONE. I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING TOO IS HOW IT WILL DOVETAIL IN WITH THEM I MAY. INITIATIVE AND HOW WE CAN FOCUS ON PRIORITIZING A COUPLE FISHERIES WHAT'S IMPORTANT THERE TOO IS TO THINK THROUGH. HOW WE CAN HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BE MORE RESILIENT IN THE FUTURE SO IF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE IF IT'S ICE IF IT'S A HOIST LIKE HOW CAN WE THINK THROUGH WHAT FISHERIES MIGHT BE THERE? IN TWENTY YEARS OF VERSES IN THE CYCLICAL CYCLES AT THE OCEAN GOES THROUGH AND SO HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE RESILIENT THROUGH THOSE CYCLES. CONSISTENT THAT SOME OF THESORT OF ON THE GROUND ON THE BOOTS ARE THE PROJECTS THAT. I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL AS THE LARGER RESTRICTED ACCESS POLICY IN ADOPTING THAT TO BE A BIT MORE. ADAPTIVE GIVEN CURRENT CONDITIONS THAT'S GREAT AT THIS ADDRESS TO DO AT ALL. I HAVE OBSERVED A FEW THE MEETINGS AND TWO WORDS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MENTIONED ICE AND VOICED. I WAS NOT READY FOR BUT FOUND VERY INTERESTING A LOT OF FEEDBACK. HEY WHEN I CATCH SOMETHING I'M TRYING TO MAKE A DECISION AS. FISHERMEN OR WOMEN WHERE I GO AND OFTEN THAT'S CONTROLLED BY THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE HARBOR. THE ICE EQUIPMENT THAT CAN HELP ME AND THEN THAT'S INFLUENCING WRAPS GOING TO OREGON RATHER THAN THE CALIFORNIA. AND THAT SEEMS LIKE INTERESTING INFORMATION THE DIMENSIONAL FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACT ON. THIS GREAT. WOULD LOVE IT. IF YOU THINK THAT ATTITUDE TO THIS FALL YOU WOULD HAVE SOME EARLY FINDINGS. WOULD THAT BE ACCURATE SO I'D ANTICIPATE A PRELIMINARY REPORT PROBABLY BY OCTOBER COMMISSION MEETING. WE WOULD LOVE IT IF IT HAD BECOME A REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE ON THIS SIX RIGHT LOOK I THINK THE THE BOTTOM LINE TO IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS. A MAN WITH A DECLINE RIGHT WE SEEM PARTICULARLY THIS IS HE'S CRAP ON THE NORTH COAST FOR EXAMPLE OR SARDINE. WHAT COMMUNITIES ARE DOING TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT AS ARE IN AT THE STATE CAN DO TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST WITH THAT AS WELL? I KNOW YOU NEED DEEP IN THIS PROCESS. IN LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ASSIST IN THE STREET BUT. OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE NORTH COAST WITH HIM WERE GONE. SALMON AND CRAP ARE YOUR NUMBER ONE DRIVERS SELL WHEN IT COMES THE ECONOMY. BUT I KNOW THAT YOU ARE KNEE DEEP IN THIS SO WOULD LOVE IT THAT BE ABLE TO HAPPY I COME IN THIS FALL. REPORT BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CRITICAL FOR BY THE ENTIRE FLEET WOULD BE THRILLED TO THINK OF THE WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. MEDICINE THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU. SOLICITOR GENERAL ELECTED TO DO A QUICK FORMAT REVIEW WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING TWO PANELS HERE WE'RE GONNA WELCOME TO OUR. SECOND PANEL OF THE DAY WHICH IS TITLED OFFSHORE OIL THREATS TO CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT ECONOMY IN FISHERIES FOR TO WELCOME OUR THREE PANELISTS VEHICLE FOR LIVING IN A DECENT. HERE IN A MOMENT FOR THEN GONNA HAVE OUR SALMON FISHERIES UPDATE HERE FROM UC DAVIS ON THEIR LATEST STUDY. THAT IS ALARMING BUILDING HERE FROM THE MAN THE MYTH THE LEGEND WHO WAS ON IT LAST NIGHT DAVIS. IN ALONG WITH JOHN MCMANUS ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SALMON FISHERY FOR AND TAKE A QUICK BREAK RIGHT AFTER THAT. AND THEN GET INTO THE REMAINDER OF THE HEARING BUT FIRST WE WELCOMED OUR ESTEEMED PANEL HERE TO. THE FORTY FIFTH ANNUAL FORM AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK I'M GONNA INTRODUCE EACH OF THEM AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MISTER. OPPENHEIM AND WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT WORKING HERE FROM TO DAY FIRST IS THE FISHING INDUSTRY IN THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF EXPANDED OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST AND THAT'S WITH NO OPPENHEIM WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION HE'S GOING TO FOCUS. ON THE PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL THREATS AT THAT. FFSHORE OIL DRILLING EXPANDED OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. POSES AND ANY POTENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS WILL HAVE ON THE FISHING INDUSTRY IF WE SEE THAT EXPANSION WITHIN CAN HEAR FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE DIRECTOR OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA IS HERE. AS CATHERINE PHILLIPS HE'S GONNA ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CONTINUED AND EXPANDED OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. AND. PROVIDING HER ANALYSIS ON WHAT AN EXPANDED PLAN WOULD LOOK LIKE A IS FAR AS THE IMPACT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE THIRD WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON IS OUR ECONOMY TO CALIFORNIA HAS A FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR COASTAL ECONOMY. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS ARE DEPENDING ON THE CLEAN COAST IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC DRIVERS WITHIN OUR CULTURAL CON ME IS OUTDOOR RECREATION. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT KATIE HOPKINS IS HERE SHE'S A STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERS. GROUP SHE'S GOING TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL IMPACTS THAT OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. HAS HAD IN MAY HAVE ON OUTDOOR RECREATION AND BY THE WAY WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT ALL OUTDOOR RECREATION. COMBINED I SAID IT'S TEN BILLION FOR OTHER REGRESSIONS TEN DEALING FOR TOURISM I POP. ZHAI'S ITS NINETY TWO BILLION ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH ALL INDUSTRIES COMBINED WHEN IT COMES TO OUTDOOR RECREATION SO WE HAVE. FISHERIES ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HERE IN THE STATE SO LET'S TURN IT OVER TO NO ONE. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN EACH OF YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROBLEM NO WE WELCOME EASTERN TAKE YOU FROM YOUR WORK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER VICE CHAIR LEADER DOLLY. MY NAME IS NO OFF TIME I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. AND I WANNA TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HARD WORK AND DEDICATION IN DEFENSE OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL FISHERIES YOU AND I AND EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM. KNOW THAT FISHING IS A PERMANENT. PART OF OUR STATE'S CLOSELY CONNIE. THAT LEGACY OF PROTECTION THAT YOU AND IVE INHERITED HIS TO PRESERVE. THESE FISHERIES AND PREVENT THE SCOURGE OF OIL DEVELOPMENT FROM IMPACTING OUR COASTLINES. CLOSING OUR FISHERIES AND DAMAGING ARE CLOSELY KANA ME. NOT ONLY IS NEW OFFSHORE OIL DEVELOPMENT IN CONGRESS WITH THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL NEED TO CURB GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT WOULD BE GREAT AND JEOPARDIZE BOTH OUR COASTAL AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS. AND OUR OCEAN ECONOMY PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL FISHERIES. THE SEVEN MEMBERS ARE RELYING ON THE HEALTH OF OUR OCEANS AND WE KNOW FIRST HAND HOW THE PRODUCTIVITY. OF THESE OCEANS PROVIDE JOBS HEALTHY FOOD AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR NATION'S ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA HAS A THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR OCEAN ECONOMY CONSISTING OF COMMERCIAL FISHING SHIPPING RECREATION TOURISM AND MANY OTHER SECTORS ALL CO EXISTING WITH RELATIVELY MINIMAL CONFLICT SHARING THE OCEAN AND ITS RENEWABLE BOUNTY. THE VALUE OF THESE INDUSTRIES INCLUDE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE FROM THE LEGAL AND SUSTAINABLE HARVEST. OF LIVING MARINE RESOURCES WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT OF OUR RENEWABLE RESOURCES THIS ECONOMY THAT WILL FLOURISH AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GOOD JOBS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY FOR GENERATIONS. OIL AND GAS AND OTHER MINERAL DEVELOPMENT IN THESE AREAS AS WELL AS IN THE ACTIVITIES REQUIRED FOR SUCH DEVELOPMENT WOULD THREATEN OUR MEMBERS LIVELIHOOD. THEY WERE JAPANESE JEOPARDIZETHEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT PROHIBITIONS AND RESULTED IN MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN IN CALIFORNIA. BY ENSURING THAT THE INEVITABLE HARM CAUSED BY PATROLLING EXTRACTION DOES NOT DEAL WITH SERIOUSLY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FISH. THE COMPANY DISTRACTIONS PLAN TO DEVELOP OFFSHORE OIL RESOURCES HERE PRIORITIZE SHORT TERM GAME FOR ONE INDUSTRY WHILE RISKING THE HEALTH AND LONGEVITY. OF ALL OTHER OCEAN AND COASTAL BASED INDUSTRIES AND THE STABILITY OF OUR COASTAL STATES ECONOMY AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES AS A RESULT. EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONTENT OF THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT STRAFFORD POST PROGRAM. PARTICULARLY AS A CONTEMPLATES CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES AND THE EXTREME MISINTERPRETATION OF THE YEAR THEIR ECONOMIC VALUE ALONG OUR COAST. MR OFF PROPOSE PROGRAM SHOCKINGLY CLAIMS THAT COMMERCIAL FISHING DOESN'T EXIST THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA LET ME JUST STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT. THERE ARE COMMERCIAL FISHING ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE FACT THAT OUR ORGANIZATION IS ABOUT TO SUBMIT FEDERAL COMMENTS TO A FEDERAL AGENCY THAT POINTS OUT THIS BASIC FACT IS ASTOUNDING. BLOWS MY MIND THE DRAFT ALSO FAILS TO CONTEMPLATE THE TRUE VALUE OF OUR FISHERIES STATEWIDE ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THAT THE SINGLE YEAR THAT WAS USED TO REPRESENT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COMMERCIAL FISHING IN STREET. WAS TWO THOUSAND NINE WHICH AS WE KNOW IS A YEAR THAT WITH DEVASTATING COMMERCIAL. SALMON FISHERY CLOSURES THAT CAUSED AN ESTIMATED LOSS OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS AND A LOSS OF EIGHTEEN. HUNDRED JOBS THE CHERRY PICKING IS SO BLATANT IT BORDERS ON THE CONSPIRATORIAL. ANYONE A BOWL AND IS OR WILL BE WATCHING. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT YOUR AGENCY THIS IS NOT QUALITY WORK IT'S SHODDY STAFF WORK IT'S SHAMEFUL REPRESENTS THE GENERAL FAILURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR TO CONTEMPLATE THE DEVASTATION IT'S DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS. THE OCEAN AND OUR RIVERS ARE TO OUR INDUSTRY. SHAMEFUL SITTING BEHIND ME NOW IS A LIVING LEGEND CAPTAIN MIKE MCCORKLE. WHO TOLD ME JUST NOW THAT HE WAS LESS THAN A MILE AWAY? WHEN OUT FISHING WHEN THE WELL THAT SPURNED THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL HAPPENED. MR MCCORKLE SHUT DOWN HIS CROWDS ARE FULL OF OIL AND YEARS LATER THE FISHING INDUSTRY WAS NEVER COMPENSATED. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN WE IT'S UNACCEPTABLE. WE NOW KNOW THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE THE DRILLING OF A SINGLE WELL. TO RESULT IN ECONOMIC HARM AND DEVASTATION THE LIVING MARINE RESOURCES SEISMIC AIR GUN SURVEYS WHICH ARE CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE MINERAL RESOURCES BELOW THE SEA FLOOR. TOE GIANT ARRAYS OF. PNEUMATIC EXPLOSIVE DEVICES WHICH. PINNING DOWN HUNDREDS OF METERS BELOW THE CREST OF THE OF THE SEA FLOOR. THESE ACOUSTIC SIGNALS WHICH ARE I'M TOLD AS LOUD AS A SPACE SHUTTLE TAKING OFF. NOT ONLY. AS WE KNOW DESTROYED THE THE. ORGANS OF MARINE MAMMALS AND AS WE'RE LEARNING CAN DISRUPT FISH POPULATIONS BUT AS WE NOW KNOW IS BASED ON A TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN STUDY ACTUALLY KILL LARVAL FISH FOR MILES AROUND. SO WE DON'T HAVE TO. DIG A SINGLE OIL WELL IN ORDER TO DESTROY OUR OCEANS. AND THESE ACTIVITIES ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW THE STATE IS STEPPING UP. IN CONCLUSION MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO SAY THAT PCS A STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AN SP EIGHT THIRTY FOUR WE HOPE THAT MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. WILL ACT TO SUPPORT THE PREVENTION OF NEW ON SHORE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR NEW OIL AND GAS LEASES. DESTRUCTIVE POSE PROGRAM IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE. WE DON'T WANT THESE NEW PIECES KEEP IT IN THE GROUND PC WITH A STANCE WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THOSE TWO BILLS WOULD BAN. THE REFINING OF ANY AND OR TRANSPORTING IF ANY THE CRUISER TO BE TAKEN OFF OF THESE RIGS OR ANY INFRASTRUCTURE ON LAND IN CALIFORNIA FROM ANY OF THESE NEW BRAKES SO. AGAIN MR EXECUTIVE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ADVOCACY HAD HANG WITH US. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR THIS YEAR CLIPS HERE MISS PHILLIPS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES MA'AM AIMED AT WE WILL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPTED THINK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE WELCOME YOU TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SON. RADIO. RED LIGHT RED LIGHT OKAY. SO THERE ARE THREE KEY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS RESULTING FROM OIL DRILLING WHILE LIFE IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS AND THE FUTURE OF THE PLANET. AND THEY EACH OF THESE THINGS WILL SUFFER IF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO ALLOW OIL EXTRACTION. HERE. BUT ESPECIALLY IN NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IS LOUD AND IF IT IS FORCED ON THE STATE BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND BY THE OIL INDUSTRY. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER. THE ADMINISTRATION IS AN ACTING ALONE IN THIS IT'S THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT'S DEMANDING THAT OFFSHORE OIL FEE OPENED UP. THE FIRST ABOUT WILDLIFE I THINK IT'S INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOK AT THE REFUGIO BEACH OIL SPILL OF MAY OF TWENTY FIFTEEN. BAT WAS AS OIL SPILLS GO A TINY OIL SPILL. TWENTY ONE THOUSAND GALLONS OF OIL ENDED UP IN THE OCEAN OF GRANITE IT CAME FROM A HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLON SPILL. FROM A PIPELINE ON ON LAND BUT ULTIMATELY TWENTY ONE THOUSAND GALLONS ENDED UP IN THE OCEAN. AND SMALLER SPILLS ARE FAIRLY COMMON. BUT. IT COVERED AN AREA OF TWENTY THREE BY SIX MILES. AND IT CLOSED WITH THAT WAS CLOSED TO FISHING AFTER THIS BILL FOR MORE THAN A MONTH TO BEACHES WERE CLOSED FOR NEARLY A MONTH DURING CLEAN UP. ACCORDING TO THE DATA COLLECTED BY THE OILED WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK DURING THE FIRST MONTH AFTER THIS BILL FIFTY SEVEN BIRDS WERE CAPTURED WITH OIL. IN AND CLEANED UP BUT A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE WERE FOUND DEAD. THE BIGGEST HIT WAS TO BROWN PELICANS SIXTY TWO MAMMALS WERE COLLECTED ALIVE AND A HUNDRED AND SIX WERE FOUND DEAD THE BIGGEST HIT WAS TO SEE LINES THERE ABOUT TWELVE DEAD DOLPHINS. THESE NUMBERS. INCREASE SLIGHTLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS BUT WHAT THESE NUMBERS DON'T REFLECT IS THE WILDLIFE YOU DON'T SEE THE BIRD TO GET OILED AND MANAGED TO. OF FLIES SHORT DISTANCE AND THEN DIE OUT FARTHER OUT AT SEA WHERE THE THE WORKERS THE RESCUE TEAMS ARE NOT LOCATED. WE ALSO DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FISH WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE TWO. THE. INSECTS TO THE THE MOLLUSKS TO ALL SORTS OF CREATURES THAT DON'T GET RESCUED. AND THEY WHAT WE WON'T KNOW THE LONG TERM IMPACTS TO THE FISHERY OF THAT OIL SPILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE FOR SCIENTISTS TO STARTS TO USED AS DIRECTED AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOTED IS HARMFUL TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF EVERY DAY POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. IS. FROM TAILPIPE EMISSIONS AS THE PRODUCT OF BURNING OIL. IN VARIOUS FORMS EITHER AS GASOLINE OR DIESEL FUEL OR OR OTHER FUELS RELATED UGH THAT COME FROM PETROLEUM OR NATURAL GAS. THESE THESE. OF. THESE EMISSIONS RESULT IN. ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS AT ANY TIME DURING THE YEAR BEING EXPOSED TO UNHEALTHY AIR. THERE'S ONLY A REALLY SMALL PORTION OF CALIFORNIANS THAT CAN SAY THAT THEY HAVE CLEAN AIR EVERY DAY. AND IF THEY NEVER LEAVE THEIR LITTLE CLEAN AIR SPOT. AND THEY DON'T GO TO SAN FRANCISCO THEY DON'T GO TO LA THEY DON'T GO TO FRESNO. THEN THEY THEY CAN AVOID BEING EXPOSED TO DIRTY AIR BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN IS EXPOSED TO DIRTY AIR AT LEAST. SOME POINT DURING THE YEAR AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE MOST POLLUTED AIR DISTRICTS LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE LOS ANGELES AIR BASE IN. THE MOST THOSE ARE TWO OF THE TOP THREE POLLUTED AIR DISTRICTS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY TO THIS TOP THREE POLLUTED AIR BASINS. AND THEY GET EXPOSED DOZENS OF DAYS EACH YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST. HIGHEST RATES OF LUNG DISEASE AMONG CHILDREN PARTICULARLY ASTHMA. WE KNOW FROM LONGITUDINAL STUDIES THAT CHILDREN WHO GROW UP IN HIGHLY POLLUTED AREAS IN CALIFORNIA REACH ADULTHOOD WITH UNDERDEVELOPED LUNGS. WE KNOW THAT PREMATURE BIRTHS ARE MORE FREQUENT AND HIGHLY POLLUTED AREAS. WE KNOW THAT HEART DISEASE IS HIGHER IN HIGHLY POLLUTED AREAS WE KNOW FROM SEVERAL YEARS AGO. AND THIS NUMBER MAY HAVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY R DECREASE SLIGHTLY I'M I'M NOT SURE BUT AT ONE POINT. A SEVERAL YEARS AGO A STUDY WAS DONE OF THE. COSTS OF AIR POLLUTION IN THE LOS ANGELES BASIN IT WAS ABOUT TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN HEALTH CARE COSTS LOST TIME AT WORK LAST DAYS AT SCHOOL AND LOST DAYS AT SCHOOL HAVE A LONG TERM IMPACT. YOU MANY WORRY SECONDS WE WILL NEVER HAVE A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA WILL NEVER ACHIEVE CLEAN AIR AND THE STATE IF WE CONTINUE TO EXTRACT AND BURN. SIMPLE AS THAT AND FINALLY THE PLANET'S FUTURE. WE NEED TO ADDRESS WE NEED TO KEEP IT IN THE GROUND JUST AS NOAH SAID IF WE DON'T KEEP IT IN THE GROUND WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A FUTURE WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE IMPACTS HERE. SO. YOU ASKED AT THE BEGINNING WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS I THINK ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR. ALL OF US WHO ARE CONSUMERS WE NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT. CHANGING OUR HABITS BUT ALSO NEED TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT SENDING A SIGNAL TO THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT THEY NEED TO CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS THEY NEED TO GET OUT OF OIL. THEY NEED TO GET INTO SOMETHING THAT'S CLEANER AND WE HAVE TO STOP BECAUSE BEING THAT ONE OF THE TOP OIL PRODUCING STATES IN THE COUNTRY. THANK YOU SO MUCH GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE. WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO I MISS HAWKINS NOW STIRRING COMMITTEE MEMBER THE CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERS OR AN OPEN UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR THE COMMITTEE. WE WELCOME YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES OF THE THIRTY SECOND PROMPT GREAT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU ALSO IT SOUNDS LIKE LAST NIGHT WAS PRETTY FUN I'M SORRY I MISSED I KNOW NEXT YEAR WATCH OUT. THERE TO GO YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THAT BEER AND CRAP. OKAY A GREAT AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I'M KATIE HOPKINS I'M A MEMBER OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE FOR THE OUT CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR RECREATION PARTNERS COURT. WE ARE GROWING COALITION OF BUSINESSES USER GROUPS AND AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT THE NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT ABOUT HER RECREATION RELATED CONSUMER SPENDING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S OUTDOOR RECREATION ECONOMY IS THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE OUTDOOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION ALLY A. RELEASE AN UPDATED REPORT OF THE STATE ABOUT OUTDOOR COMPANY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT FOUND THAT THE CALIFORNIA OUTDOOR ECONOMY REPRESENTS GREATER THAN NINETY TWO BILLION DOLLAR. ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO THE STATE SUPPORTS NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS AND GENERATES OVER THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN SALARIES AND WAGES. THIS WAS NEARLY TEN PERCENT. INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS FIVE YEARS. OUR STATE ECONOMY IS THE SIXTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD AND IT'S TIED TO CLEAN COASTAL WATERS AND BEACHES AS WELL AS A STABLE CLIMATE. OUR STATE BOASTS ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR CLOSED AREAS IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD APPROXIMATELY OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION TOURISTS ANNUALLY. CONTOUR CAUSE TO FISH HIKE KAYAK SURF WINE AND DINE ENJOY OUR BEACHES ARE COOL SILICON A METER SKIS NEAR COASTAL CONNIE CONTRIBUTES MORE THAN A HALF A MILLION JOBS. AND FORTY BILLION ANNUALLY TO THE STATE OCEAN BASED RECREATION AND TOURISM ALONE CONTRIBUTES TWENTY BILLION. ANNUALLY AND PROVIDES MORE THAT JOBS THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY. SO CALIFORNIANS CARE DEEPLY ABOUT OUR ELEVEN HUNDRED MILE COASTLINE AND PUBLIC BEACHES WHICH SURPRISED MILLIONS OF VISITORS A YEAR OUR POST IS HOME TO A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR STATE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. FORMER NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARIES AND FOR NATIONAL PARKS WITH OCEAN WATERS. THESE AREAS PROTECTED SPECIES AND ECOSYSTEMS AND HELP FUEL A VIBRANT COASTAL ECONOMY. NOW I KNOW THAT KATHERINE SPOKE ABOUT SANTA BARBARA INSERTED NO LESS I DON'T REALLY WHAT I JUST WANT TO ECHO THEIR COMMENTS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE OFFSHORE DRILLING HAS ESPECIALLY. THAT LONG LASTING EFFECTS WHEN SPILLS DO HAPPEN SO I JUST WANT TO ECHO YOUR COMMENTS WE FEEL THE SAME. SO GOING ON I JUST WANNA SAY WE THEREFORE STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS UNDER WAY AT THE LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL TO OPPOSE NEW OR EXPANDED OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. THE PACIFIC OCEAN IN KHOST SUSTAINS OUR ECONOMIES IN THE COMMUNITIES AND OFFSHORE DRILLING IS FUNDAMENTALLY AT ODDS WITH OUR COASTAL ECONOMY IN A WAY OF LIFE. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S THRIVING RECREATION INTERESTS INDUSTRY IS RELYING ON A HEALTHY ACCESSIBLE COAST AND OCEAN CORP OPPOSES ANY NEW OFF SHORE OIL OR GAS DEVELOPMENT OFF CALIFORNIA. AND THINKS THIS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP. AND STOP IN ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER THE COMMITTEE TO SEE FIFTY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON THIS PARTICULAR PANEL. SO JUST A QUICK COMMENT THINKS MUCH. OBVIOUS IS BIPARTISAN ISSUE WE HAVE FIVE I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SIX REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS HAVE COME OUT AGAINST THIS PLAN. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OTHERS OF REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK OBVIOUS INSTRUMENT I'M GLAD BIPARTISAN INDUSTRY THAT YOU REPRESENT AND A UNIFIED IN THE APPROACHES. IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING LIVELIHOODS. THAT'S RIGHT. THE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT IS STARKLY% CLEAR. AND. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. CHERUB CHOIR THERE'S NO THEIR NO BONES ABOUT IT WHETHER YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL. OUTSIDE THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT THIS INDUSTRY HAS NO PLACE IN THESE PARTICULAR WATERS ABSOLUTELY NOT AND. II'M GLAD THAT POLITICAL REALITIES. ARE ENABLING EVERYONE TO COME TOGETHER. AND THEN SHARE THIS OPINION AND JOIN IN PROTECTING OUR COCINA CENTURIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE MISSILES. I JUST WANT TO NOTE. YOU KNOW BEING AN ENVIRONMENTALIST DOESN'T HAVE A PARTY AFFILIATION EITHER AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING IN CALIFORNIA SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I THINK ONE REASON CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEAD ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IS BECAUSE IT IS CONSIDERED A BIPARTISAN ISSUE IN THE STATE. IT ISN'T ALWAYS REFLECTED BY SOME OF THE VOTES WE SEE. BUT THEN IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT I THINK IF YOU TALK TO MOST CALIFORNIANS YOU'RE GOING TO FIND THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS DO NOT WANT. OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING WHETHER THEY'RE REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT NOTHING SO MUCH. MY LAST QUESTION IS HAWKINS CAN YOU BREAK OUT THAT NINETY TWO BILLION HOW MUCH OF IT IS CEAN DEPENDENT IN COASTAL DEPENDENT. DO YOU HAVE ANY BREAK DOWN ON THAT YEAH SO HE'S. FILL UP THAT. THE BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT OCEAN BASED RECREATION AND TOURISM WAS ABOUT TWENTY BILLION ABOUT TWENTY BILLION YES. THAT'S GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL A COMPLETE SYSTEM. IS NOT THE LABOR THIS BUT JUST TO WEIGH IN A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT HAVE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRACTICAL MATTER. OF HAVING OFFSHORE OIL LEASES WITH WITHOUT ONSHORE FACILITIES THE MORE WE PUSH BACK ACROSS CALIFORNIA THE LESS LIKELY IT IS THAT ANYONE COULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS. STAKE IN THESE. LEASE SALES. IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REALLY MOVES FORWARD ON THIS AND WHERE WE ARE VULNERABLE IS WHERE THERE ARE EXISTING FACILITIES. ON SHORE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO MOVE MORE OIL IN BUT A LOT OF THOSE FIELDS ARE. DEPLETED IT'S DOESN'T IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO DO MUCH OTHER THAN TRY TO EXPAND DRILLING. FOR THE LOUDER WE ARE THE MORE. COMPREHENSIVE THE RESPONSE TO THE FEDERAL PLAN THAN THE LESS LIKELY ANYONE WILL WANT TO. REALLY ACQUIRE THOSE PLACES BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A FIGHT. SO THAT'S WHAT EERY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT LOT OF RALLIES HAVE BEEN DONE ACROSS CALIFORNIA TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE. AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE ALL WENT OUR VOICE TO THE EFFORT TEACHER OR TO TO CUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT INTERESTED IN THIS CHANGE. WITHOUT A VERY CONSISTENT POLICY TOWARDS OFFSHORE DRILLING FOR DECADES NOW CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE NOT INTERESTED AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGREED WITH THAT UNTIL NOW SO IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING TO SEE. THIS CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND WE JUST NEED TO STAND TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PAST YEAR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PARAGRAPH THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING SO MUCH TIME AND YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. PLEASE YEAH WE'RE NOT IN THE MOVIE FOR TWO OUR THIRD PANEL THAT DAY IN THAT IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SALMON FISHERIES. WE E. ARE GONNA HAVE EACH OF OUR THREE PANELISTS APPEAR TO PLEASE COME FORWARD WE'RE GONNA START OUR PANEL TODAY WITH THE DOCTOR I ROBERT LAZAR USE THE RESEARCH ECOLOGISTS. IN CALIFORNIA TRY YOU SEE DAVIS WILD IN COLD WATER FISH SCIENTISTS HIS BUSINESS CARD IS REALLY LARGE WITH THAT TITLE. HE'S WITH THE CENTER FOR WATER SHOULD SCIENTISTS WITH. THE AGGIES THEY'RE. THE GOOD DOCTOR IS GOING TO BE GIVEN THIS IS. A REPORT ON THE STATE OF SALMON AWAITS THE STATUS OF CALIFORNIA'S. DIPLOMATIC FISHES THAT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE URGENT NEED TO PROTECT AND RESTORE CALIFORNIA STATUS FISH AND I GOTTA SAY. AS WE TALKED ABOUT LAST YEAR WE ARE IN FOR SOME REAL CHALLENGES YOU TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THOSE HT WATER TEMPS WE'RE ALSO GONNA PLEASE HAVE COME FOR DATE DATES. PRESENT THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION FISHERMAN'S ASSOCIATION. MISTER BATES IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE STATUS OF CHINOOK SALMON RUNS. IN THE COMMERCIAL A SALMON FISHERY HE'S ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING INTO HIS CRYSTAL BALL TODAY. IT ABOUT THREATS TO BOTH. EYES SPECIES AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. FINALLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE MISTER MCMANUS PLEASE COME FORWARD HE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION. JOHNS GONNA BE PRESENTING CHALLENGES FACING RECREATIONAL SALMON FISHING DUE TO IN RIVER IMPACTS. TO CENTRALVALLEY SALMON AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FLOWS IN OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESTORATION. BUT BEFORE WE GET TO BOTH OF THOSE GENERAL WE'RE GRATEFUL TO DR THE SARTI WHO'S HERE TODAY FROM UC DAVIS HE IS GOING TO BE PRESENT IN. HIGH LEVEL VIEW OF HIS STUDY YOU'VE MADE SCENE IS IN MANY. NEWS OUTLETS ACROSS THE STATE. THIRTY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MINUTES WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU ABOUT A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO MISTER BATES INTO MISTER MCMANUS FOR FIVE MINUTES. THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WE WELCOME YOU TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU HOUSE UNDER IT UNDERSTAND NINETY MINUTES HAZY THERE IN THE HIGH DID AS I WAS SAYING. WE SURE THROWN AT YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN KAREN SAY PRITCHETT OPPORTUNITY SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT OUR REPORT AND SAYS SOME ON AND SAYS TO US TOO. AND I WAS A CO AUTHOR ON THEIR PART WITH DOCTOR PETERS MORAL PATTER SEMEL SAMUEL AND JACOB CATS AS WELL. FROM CALIFORNIA TROUT. WE UNDERTOOK THIS RESEARCH OVER APPEARED ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AND WE REVIEW THE STATUS OF ALL SOMEONE IS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ASKED THREE SIMPLE QUESTIONS. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF CALIFORNIA SOMEONE IT'S WHAT FACTORS TO DO BECAUSE THEY'RE DECLINE AND HOW THEY CAN THEY BE CONSERVED INTO THE FUTURE? AND WE'LL SKIP RIGHT TO THE FINDINGS. IN GENERAL THE STATUS OF SOME ON ADS IN CALIFORNIA OR IN CONTINUE TO BE IN THE GENERAL STATE OF DECLINE WE PREDICT THAT FORTY FIVE PERCENT IN SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF ALL SALMON AND TROUT IN CALIFORNIA. ARE LIKELY TO GO EXTINCT WITHIN FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED YEARS RESPECTIVELY IF PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE. I NATTER MISTER SPEAKER ID MIGRATING FISH SITUATION IT CAN STILL HAD ARE IN GENERAL A GREATER RISK OF EXTINCTION IN RESIDENT. IN ONE SPECIES. WHAT FACTORS OF BECAUSE THEY'RE DECLINED THE MAJOR SINGLER THREATS INCLUDE DANCE COMPETITION FOR WATER ESTUARY ALTERATION IN NON NATIVE SPECIES SPECIES INTERACTIONS? OF ALL THE THREATS WE CONSIDERED HOWEVER CLIMATE CHANGES FOUND AFFECT NEARLY EVERY SOMEONE IT NEGATIVELY MOVING FORWARD. HOW CAN THEY BE CONSERVED? I THINK THAT WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK MUCH FURTHER. THAN THEIR EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY SALMON HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR AT LEAST FIFTY MILLION YEARS THEY'VE WEATHERED MEGA DROUGHTS MASSIVE FLOODS EARTHQUAKES HABITAT DISCONNECTIONS PURGE OF GLACIATION. VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. DESPITE ALL THIS THEY CONTINUE TO PERSIST THEY'RE ABLE TO PROCESS BECAUSE AT THEIR CORE SPILL SPECIES WERE BUILT OF NUMEROUS DIVERSE POPULATIONS. AND AS SUCH WERE INCREDIBLY RESILIENT TO CHANGE. SO WILL SOMEONE DIE OFF DURING EVENTS SUCH AS A MEGA DROUGHT OTHER SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WOULD RECOLONIZE ADAPT IN SPECIES AS A WHOLE WILL CONTINUE TO PERSISTAND PERSEVERE. THOSE DIVERSE POPULATION FOR PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPE. TODAY SALMON DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE DIVERSITY TO HABITAT AND YOU MAKE MANY CASES ARE GENETICALLY HOMOGENIZED. TWO GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS. PHOENIX SALMON SPECIFICALLY HAVE. THE SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEIR CIRCLE SPAWNING HABITAT IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED IT NOW LIES ABOVE HIGH HEAD DAMN THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NINETY TO NINETY PERCENT OF ALL FOUR PLANES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM PLAINS OF COURSE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT HABITAT FOR JUVENILE FICTION JUNE ARE REARING. THE KEY TO RESTORING SALMON TROUT THROUGH A CALIFORNIA IS RESTORING ACCESS TO THESE DIVERSE HABITATS IN PRODUCTIVE HABITATS AND PROMOTING WHILE THE NATURAL ORIGIN SPAWNING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. WE BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS IS AS FOLLOWS. PROTECT THE HIGHLY FUNCTIONING SYSTEM TO CONTINUE EXCESS THE SYSTEMS INCLUDE PLACES LIKE THE SMITHS THE EAGLE BLUE CREEK AND VIEW CRAIG FOR SPRING RUN. ATTACKED IN HER STORE SOURCE WATER SO THEY CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY WATER FOR SALMON AND TROUT DURING PERIODS OF DROUGHT. ENTERING AND AS CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES. RESTORE A PRODUCTIVE IN DIVERSE HABITATS IN HISTORICAL PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN ST LIFE HISTORY MOST SOUTHERLY THESE WOULD INCLUDE FLOOD PLAINS THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY SUCH AS THE YELLOW BY PASSING CENTER BY PASSES AS WELL. IMPROVE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY IN PASSAGE TO HISTORICAL SPAWNING AND REARING HABITAT TO DAM REMOVAL OR PASSAGE. GENETIC MANAGEMENT TO COURAGE NATURAL ORIGIN WALLFISCH GENOME TO PERSIST INTO THE FUTURE. AND FINALLY INCORPORATE CONSERVATION INTO HUMAN DOMINATED LANDSCAPES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS TO CONSIDER WHILE FISH AND PEOPLE A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS THE WORK THAT. YOU SEE DAVIS IN CALIFORNIA TROUT HAD DONE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WORKING WITH FARMERS TO REAR CHINOOK SALMON. AN EXPERIMENTAL FLOOD PLAINS IN RICE FIELDS. WITH THAT. I COULD TALK ABOUT THE METHODS AND WHAT NOT BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU GUYS A LIST ESSENTIALLY THE MOST THREATENED SPECIES IN RANK ORDER THAT WE REVIEWED. CENTRAL VALLEY WINTER RUN CHINOOK CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL CALIFORNIA COAST COHO SALMON OPERA PLANET TRINI SPRING RUN CHINOOK SOUTHERN OREGON NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST SALMON CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK. KLAMATH MOUNTAINS PRIVATE SUMMER STEEL HEAD SOUTH CENTRAL COAST DEAL HAD SOUTHERN STEEL HEAD KERN RIVER RAINBOW TROUT MACLEOD RAINBOW TROUT IN OUR STATE FISH THE CALIFORNIA GOLDEN TROUT ALL THOSE RANKED IS CRITICAL. AND IF THINGS DON'T CHANGE VERY SOON IT WILL BE GONE WITHIN FIFTY YEARS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. TERRIBLE NEWS. LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE OR ANY COMMENTS. CAN YOU. WE SAW SADISTIC LAST YEAR THAT AT THE SACRAMENT A WATERSHED IN PARTICULAR IS MORE IMPAIRED. IN WE COULD ACTUALLY START SCENE PERMANENT. DIE OFF OF INTO EXTINCTION EVENTS HERE IN THE NEXT DECADE OR TWO. SO WHEN YOU SAY FORTY FIVE PERCENT. OVER THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS IT'S GONNA BE EXPEDITED IN SPECIFIC. WATERSHED CAN YOU GO INTO THAT A BIT SURE THAT'S EXACTLY THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT SO. OF ALL THE SPECIES I I PROBABLY JUST DISCUSSING AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT DIRECTION AFTER OF COURSE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THEIR REMNANT OF WHAT THEY ONCE WERE THESE ARE VOLCANIC FISH. FOR THE LONG RUN FISH THEY MOVED UP TO PLACES LIKE THE MCCLOUD RIVER UP BY NOT SHASTA THEY CAN NO LONGER ACCESS AT HABITAT THEY'VE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THEIR STRUGGLE HABITAT. LAST YEAR THEY HAD. LESS THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS RETURN OF COURSE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN ENTIRE CORPS COHORTS WERE NEARLY ELIMINATED THE NINETY FIVE PERCENT LEVEL DUE TO WARM WATER. SO. FRANKLY IF WE HAD ANOTHER YEAR OF DROUGHT THAT FISH COULD BE GONE ABSOLUTELY SO IT IS A CONTINUING THROUGH THAT FIFTY YEAR PERIOD THE TWO THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT PRIMARILY AS GENERATION TIME. IN POPULATION SIZES TO GET AT THOSE NUMBERS. IN THE IN. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK ACROSS THE STATE HOW MANY NINE HATCHERY FISH OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU JUST. NAMED ARE ACTUALLY OUT THERE VERSUS. COMING FROM HATCHERY WOULD YOU SAY. SO SAY THAT AGAIN SO HOW MANY THE FISH OUT OF THE SPECIES THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED YET. HOW MANY ARE COMING FROM HATCHERY VERSION IS STILL WILD WHAT WOULD BE YOUR GUIDE SAY ON ALL THE SPECIES WELL WE KNOW THAT? WINTER INCHING UP AGAIN IS IS HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY LIVING TOMBSTONE THEY HAVE A CONSERVATION HATCHERY SO THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM SAY A PRODUCTION HATCHERY RIGHT. CONSERVATION HAVE TREES REALLY VALUE THE GENETICS. BUT CERTAINLY. SEVERAL THE POPULATIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY MOST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY RUNS OF SHOULD NOT CAR INFLUENCE TO SOME EXTENT BY HATCHERY. HATCHERIES YEAH. HATCHERY FISH THROUGH INTERACTIONS IN THE WILD. THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE HAD. AT LEAST ON THE NORTH COAST AND ON THE EAGLE RIVER WATERSHED. IN I THINK IT WAS AT TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WE ACTUALLY SAW THE ILL GO DRY. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY LEGAL OF WATER POOLS FROM ROSE CANADA'S GROSS YEAH MAN IN THAT IT HAS EXASPERATED THE PROBLEM. ON THE. RIVER WATERSHED HAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED ANY COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH I WOULD COMPLETELY GREE WITH THAT HOW IS IT DEFAULT TO MY FRIEND AMARO WHO WORKS VERY CLOSELY ON THIS STUFF UP IN THE NORTH COAST IS ACTUALLY IN THE ROOM WILL BE SPEAKING LATER. BUT REGULATING THE CANDIDATES IN HISTORY IN WATER WITHDRAWALS AND DIVERSIONS IS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT MOVING FOR THESE THESE FISH ARE ALREADY ON THE BRINK SO. ADDITIONAL KIND OF. EXTRACTION FROM STREAMS AND RIVERS IS IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR WORK ANY OTHER FULL OF ITEMS BREAK GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK TODAY YES HOW MUCH. WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN IT OVER TO DAVID'S PRESIDENT OF PACIFIC CONSIDERATION FISHERMAN'S ASSOCIATION. AND AGAIN WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE DISTURBANCE FORTY YEARS. OF HIS ADVOCACY IN LEADERSHIP. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA SUITE. IN THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE AS WE SAID LAST NIGHT THERE'S UP AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN. A TOP OF MIND FOR CALIFORNIA'S FISHERMEN THEY DID IT'S IT'S NOT BEEN A CHAMPION FOR HIS FRANTIC MOMENTS SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH IN THE LEGISLATURE HONORED HIM LAST NIGHT. IN INDIA WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE DRIVE SIR FROM BEAUTIFUL HUMBLE COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THOSE KIND WORDS AND ALSO FOR THE AWARD LAST NIGHT I WAS. COMPLETELY FLORIDA HAD NO IDEA THAT WAS COMING AND I WONDERED WHAT I WAS FEELING STANDING UP THERE. IT'LL ALL THOSE MUCH MORE ACCOMPLISHED PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OF SPEAKING A MORE ACCOMPLISHED PEOPLE OR WAS. GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE RUNS AND THREATS TO THEM THAT THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN COVERED MUCH BETTER THAN I EVER COULD. BY THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT I'LL SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT IT THINK. WE'VE DONE FOR A LONG TIME THE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE STOCK OF THE SACRAMENTO FALL RUN CHINOOK THAT WE DEPEND ON. FOR MOST OF THE OCEAN FISHERIES. ARE PRIMARILY HATCHERY STOCK. IN YEARS AGO THERE WAS A A VERY ASTUTE BIOLOGIST FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FRANK FISHER WHO SAID. MOST OF THE FISH SPAWNING GRAVEL AND CAME FROM HATCHERIES THAT'S BEEN TRUE FOR A LONG TIME LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT I'M AWARE OF. THAT THE NUMBER OF FISH SPAWNING IN GRAVEL WAS LESS THAN THE NUMBER THAT CAME BACK TO THE HATCHERIES. IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. OKAY. OF THE BIG ISSUE. OTHER THAN CLIMATE CHANGE. OF THE BIG ISSUE IS HAVING ENOUGH WATER OF SUITABLE QUALITY AT THE RIGHT TIME. WE WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING THAT WAR FOR FORTY YEARS WE ARE NOT YET OF WINNING THAT WAR WE'VE. ALL COME BACK TO THIS UP THAT SUBJECT LATER. OF THERE IS A LITTLE SPOT OF GOOD NEWS. OF JACK RETURNS AGE TO FISH THAT CAME BACK IN BOTH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE KLAMATH LAST YEAR. WERE ALIGNED SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER NUMBERS THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. ALL. FISHERMEN AND THE GULF OF THE FERAL LAWS LAST SUMMER FOUND THE. WHAT I WOULD SAY WAS A HYPER ABUNDANCE OF AGE TO FISH? THAT SHOULD PORTEND A GOOD YEAR THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHICH IS THIS YEAR HOWEVER. OF THE JACK RETURNS DIDN'T QUITE REFLECT THE OUT. OF HIM. THE. SCIENTISTS WHO. PREDICT THE SIZE OF THE RUN. HAVE. FOR SOUND REASONS TAKEN A VERY CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO PREDICTING THIS YEAR'S ABUNDANCE. AND. ALL WE MAY NOT SEE THE BENEFITS IN FISHERIES IN THE OCEAN OF OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY ROBUST RUN. AND THIS IS SOMEWHAT PERPLEXING WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT. TONIGHT ROHNERT PARK AND THROUGH THE PACIFIC COUNCIL MEETING THAT'S COMING UP. NEXT WEEK OUR WAR BEGINS ACTUALLY OF FRIDAY. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT. WE CAN WORK OUT. ABOUT THAT THE OCEAN COMMERCIAL FISHERY IS ON ITS KNEES. WE. WE HAD GOOD YEARS IN. TWELVE AND THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN WE HAVE NOT HAD. A DECENT YEAR SINCE AND IT NOW LOOKS AS THOUGH THIS YEAR'S SEASON. MAY BE EVEN MORE RESTRICTED THAN LAST YEAR'S BY. THE POOR PRODUCTION OF SACRAMENTAL FALL CHINOOK. THE LAST TWO YEARS SHOULD QUALIFY OF THE OCEAN SALMON FISHERY SHOULD QUALIFY FOR DISASTER. DECLARATIONS I HOPE THAT WON'T BE THE CASE THIS YEAR. OF WE'LL SEE HOW THAT TURNS OUT. I GUESS I'M HOPING THAT. FOLLOWING THE LITTLE BIT OF OPPORTUNITY WILL HAVE WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE PRODUCTIVE THAN IT'S BEEN. THE LAST FEW YEARS. OF WE ARE A LONG LONG WAYS FROM THE GLORY DAYS OF THE LATE NINETIES AND EARLY AUGHTS WIN OF. THE QUESTION WAS HOW FAST CAN YOU HANDLE FISH ON THE BOAT AND TAKE CARE OF THEM TO GET THEM CHILLED. WE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR QUITE AWHILE. OF. THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF THE FISHERY IN ADDITION TO THE WATER SITUATION AND OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE IN THE STATE THAT WATER FLOWS UP HILL TO MONEY. OF. WE BELIEVE THE TWIN TUNNELS WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR SALMON AND FOUR OTHER FISH AND WILDLIFE ALL OF THE FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT USE THE DELTA. AND THE BAY YOU CANNOT RESTORE AN ESTUARY BY DIVERTING FRESH WATER FLOWS AROUND IT THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO ITS FUNCTIONS. AND SO WE WOULD. LIKE TO SEE THAT NOT HAPPEN OFFSHORE DRILLING OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN MORE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT IT THEN I WILL. BUT IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS NOT JUST FOR SALMON FISHERIES BUT FOR MOST MARINE LIFE. AND ALL THE PEOPLE. WHO EITHER MAKE A LIVING ON THE OCEAN ENJOYED RECREATIONALLY OR SIMPLY TRAVEL TO THE COAST TO ADMIRE THE BEAUTY OF THE OCEAN THAT? THESE DISASTERS HAVEN'T HAPPENED YET AND CAN BE PREVENTED. CLIMATE CHANGE. IS A HUGE THREAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON IT'S THE SOUTHERN END OF THE RANGE. AND WE SEE A GENERAL TREND IN SPECIES TO MIGRATE TO THE NORTH. OF AS CLIMATE CHANGE OCCURS. OF AN. IT'S GOING TO BE A MORE INTENSE STRUGGLE IN THE FUTURE TO MAINTAIN. ROBUST RUNS OF SALMON IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SO WHAT WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. FIRST OF ALL. WE HAVE TO STOP TREATING WATER AS THOUGH IT IS AN INFINITE AND FREE. RESOURCE IS IT CLEARLY IS NOT. WE'VE BEEN TAKING MORE WATER FROM THE DELTA THE THAN IT HAS TO GIVE FOR A LONG TIME IF WE VALUE THE DELTA. AS A LIVING AND BOUNTIFUL YES YOU ARE. AND WE HAVE TO ONCE WE FACE THAT REALITY YOU HAVE TO ADAPT TO IT BY CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT WATER IN THE WAY WE USE IT. ONE THING WE COULD DO THERE IS A TEMPLATE. AND THAT WOULD BE THAT IS THE MEASURES PROPOSED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL WATER CARCASS. AND THEIR DOCUMENT A SUSTAINABLE WATER PLAN FOR CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THAT DOCUMENT DESERVES A GOOD HARD LOOK BY PEOPLE IN A POSITION TO MAKE. AND CHANGE POLICY. THIRTY SIXTY MINUTES OKAY. MENTION IF THE MILLION MAN HOURS SPENT ATTEMPTING TO JUSTIFY THE TWIN TUNNELS HAD INSTEAD BEEN DEVOTED. TO FINDING MANY SMALL FIXES TO THE WATER PROBLEMS THAT THREATEN EVERYONE IN THE STATE RATHER THAN BEING. SPENT ON ONE GREAT DEALS PIPE DREAM. THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRETTYGREAT FOR MUCH OF ITS AND WERE AT IT'S APPRECIATE YOU ALWAYS BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE AS WELL. THANK YOU SIR WE'RE NOT GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISTER MCMANUS PRESENT THE GOLD SEES HIM AN ASSOCIATION. WHO HAS BROUGHT ALONG A POWER POINT IS WELL WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH CERTAINLY WELCOME? THANKS FOR HAVING ME GOOD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY SENATOR REQUIRE SOME WOMEN STONE DOLLY. GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE TRONIC MAN IS PRESENT IN THE GOLDEN GATE SALMON ASSOCIATION THRILLED AT MY SLIDES BEEN UP SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE. ACTUALLY WE JUST LIKE TO COMMENT ABOUT THE DINNER LAST NIGHT FOR PEOPLE IN THE ROOM SENATOR GORE WAS ACTUALLY SERVING PEOPLE WITH PLATTERS OF FOOD HE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT AND IT WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE AND SHOWS WHAT KIND OF GUY SENATOR MIKE MCGUIRE IS MEANT. HAVING SAID THAT I WANT TO THANK. MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY FOR THE PASSAGE OF A SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION SEVEN. THAT WAS INCREDIBLE I WANT TO THANK SECRETARY LAYERED FOR HIS ROLE IN GETTING THE CODE WORD TAG ISSUE. IRONED OUT WITH THE FEATHER RIVER HAD TREE THIS YEAR. DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES WILL PAY FOR THOSE TAGS WHICH IS A GOOD THING BIG STEP FORWARD. AND I WANT TO ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LETTER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES URGING THEM TO GET ON BOARD WITH. THE RESTORATION OF THAT AREA IN THE WORLD BILL WILDLIFE AREA UNITY WITH THE SUTTER BUTTES FLOOD CONTROL AGENCY. AFTER THAT LETTER GREAT PROGRESS IS MADE D. W. R. CAME AROUND AND BACKS THE PROPOSAL NOW AND FOR THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION IS SAYING NICE THINGS SO THEY HAVEN'T GIVEN A FORMAL GREEN LIGHT. BUT WE'RE MOVING IN A GOOD DIRECTION SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. OFFSHORE OIL YOU KNOW WE GOT T PULL THE FISH UP THROUGH THE WATER INTO THE BOAT AND IF THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO DEAL WITH IT pJUST ISN'T GOING TO WORK. I'M ON THE FLIP SIDE THIS CAME OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO MEXICO FROM THE DEEP WATER HORIZON. I'M NOT AN EXPERT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE COMMERCIALLY RECOVERABLE QUANTITIES OFF THE NORTH COAST WHICH MAKES ME WONDER WHY THE STRAP PLAN EVEN CAME OUT MAYBE JUST A STICK IN THE EYE TO CALIFORNIA. DON'T KNOW. STATUS OF OUR SALMON RUNS. A BUNCH PEOPLE SPOKEN TO IT LOOK AT THE FAR RIGHT TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THIS IS THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY WE HAD UNDER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ADULTS THAT A THREE YEAR OLDS ADULTS ARE RETURNED. THAT SECOND LOWEST. BEATEN ONLY BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE WERE SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY OUT ON THE OCEAN. SO. NOT A GOOD SITUATION THE RED BAND IN THE MIDDLE POINTS TO THE TARGET THAT THEY'RE MANAGING FOR. THEY WANT TO SEE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND ADULT SALMON COME BACK WE MISSED IT. THE LAST THREE YEARS. AND HERE'S A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER RUNS LATE FALL RUN AGAIN WENT AROUND SPRING RUN. YOU'LL NOTICE ON THE WINNER RUN WE HAD LESS THAN A THOUSAND THAT RETURNED THIS PAST YEAR SPRING RUN WE HAD LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND. SO NOT A GOOD SITUATION AND WE'VE MISSED THE TARGET SLASH THREE YEARS IN A ROW. IN UNDER THE MAGNUSON STEVENS FEDERAL FISHERIES ACT. THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THOU MUST DECLARE THEM OVER FISH WE DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE THE SITUATION WE'VE GOTTEN CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY GOT HAMMERED BECAUSE A DROUGHT AND WATER OPERATIONS. SO THEY CALL IT OVER FISH DEPLETED WE WOULD ARGUE IS MORE ACCURATE IN THIS INSTANCE. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A PROPOSAL OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO AMEND THAT FEDERAL LAW TO GET DEPLETED INCLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE I I ONLY BRING THIS UP BECAUSE IT'S BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS. AND CREATED SOME CONFUSION IN THE PUBLIC THIS BUSINESS ABOUT OVER FISHED. I WANT TO SHIFT GEARS AND MOVE TO THE OLD BY PASS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE THE STATE AND THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ABOUT ON THE HOOK. TO GET THE FREMONT WE'RE NOTCHED LOWERED MODIFIED IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM SO IT FLOODS WATER INTO IT MORE OFTEN YOU REMEMBER LAST YEAR EVERY TIME HE CAME OVER THE CAUSEWAY. IT LOOK LIKE LAKE MICHIGAN OUT THERE WHEN WE SEE THAT THAT'S GOOD NEEDS FULL OF DINKY LITTLE THREE YEAR OLD SALEM THAT ARE GETTING FAT AND HAPPY SO. WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S AN ARTIFICIAL DAM AT THE NORTH END OF IT THE FREMONT WE'RE WHAT IF WE SHAVE THE THING WHAT IF WE NOT*. FINALLY IN DECEMBER. THE. THE RESOURCES AGENCY CAME OUT WITH A DRAFT PLAN. GIANT STEP FORWARD TOOK A LONG TIME TO DO IT BUT NOW THE DRAFT IS ON THE. IS OUT THERE. UNFORTUNATELY IN THE DRAFT PLAN WE FEEL LIKE THEY CHOSE THE WRONG ALTERNATIVE. WE COMMENTED ON IT NOW IS FOR WHAT'S CALLED ALTERNATIVE SIX BASICALLY IT TAKES THE BIGGEST WHACK OUT OF THE FREMONT WE'RE WOULD PUT THE GREATEST NUMBER OF FISH IN THERE. AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR. RESOURCES TO COME AROUND AND COME OUT WITH A FINAL THE I. R. YEAH YES. THAT ADVOCATES FOR THIS. SO WE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN UNITY IN THE ORVILLE WILDLIFE AREA BUT I'M COMING BACK TO ORACLE JUST OR A MINUTE. THIS THING HERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS OUR BIGGEST HEADACHE UP THERE THAT'S HOT WATER POURING. OUT OF THE THERMAL LIDO AFTER BAY DOWN INTO THE FEATHER RIVER BASICALLY NEGATING SOME FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILES AN OTHERWISE GREAT SALMON HABITAT. MAKING IT TOO HOT. D. W. R. SWEARS ON A STCK OF BIBLES THAT THEY'LL FIX THIS PROBLEM ONCE THEY GET THEIR LICENSE RENEWED. AND WE WILL TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD THIS. IDEA AND IT'S ALL IN THE LICENSE RENEWAL FOR GOOD OR FOR ILL I'M NOT COMMENTING UNDERSTAND THE LICENSES HUNG UP SO IT'S BEEN TWELVE YEARS. SINCE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FIX IF THERE'S ANYTHING THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO HELP US AT LEAST GET DO W. OR TO MOVE ON THE THERMAL LIDO ISSUE. THAT WOULD BE HUGE. SO HERE'S A HAPPY PICTURE. THIS IS UP ON THE ROGUE RIVER. THIS IS AN ORGAN SHE MAY NOT HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS BUT WHILE THE CALIFORNIA RIVERS HAVE BEEN SUFFERING THE ROGUES GOING OFF THE HOOK. IT'S GOT THE SECOND BIGGEST PRODUCTION FOR CONTRIBUTION TO THE OCEAN AFTER THE COLOMBIAN SNAKE RIVER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE ENTIRE WEST COAST. IT BEATS THE KLAMATH IT BEATS THE SACRAMENTO BY A FACTOR OF TWO. YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY ON THIS RIVER THEY TOOK OUT THREE DAMS ON THE MAIN STEM THEY TOOK OUT A SEVERAL ON SMALL TRIBUTARIES. THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE POOL WATER UP IN THE HEADWATERS OF THE RESERVE JUST FOR SALMON. FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND THREE YEAR OLDS SPEND A LOT OF THEM FOURS MIXED IN THERE TOO AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SHOT. SO WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT WERE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS WHEN THE KLAMATH DAMS COME OUT. AND MAYBE WE WILL BE LOOKING AT A FUTURE LIKE THIS. I WANT TO SWITCH IT AND TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. FOR BRIEF MOMENTS AND THAT IS WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME PRETTY STIFF FEDERAL THREATS TO OUR WATER SUPPLY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS YEAR. WITHOUT GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL UNDER THE OF SO CALLED WIN ACT THE FEDS HAVE TRIED TO PUMP IN EXCESS OF WHAT'S ALLOWED. US SEVERAL TIMES TO THE WINNER AND UP THE STATE HAS NOT. GIVEN THEIR PERMISSION. AND BASICALLY NOT PLAYED BALL THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION CAME OUT WITH THE WATER ALLOCATION PLAN IN FEBRUARY. THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE WROTE A LETTER SAYING WE CAN'T GO WITH IT IS GOING TO WIPE OUT WHEN A RUN. TO THE POINT I'M GETTING T IS WE NEED SP FORTY NINE TO BE PASSED WE NEED SOME STATE BASED PROTECTIONS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW UP FEDERAL ACTIONS ARE A MAJOR THREAT TO US. ABOUT A MINUTE OKAY. ONE LAST THING ALL VISIT ON AND THAT IS THE SO THE WATER COMMISSION AND THE PROP ONE FUNDING. FROM WHAT WE CAN TELL THEM WE'VE LOOKED INTO IT. THE WATER COMMISSION STAFF DOING A GOOD JOB. OF LOOKING AT APPLICATIONS THAT COME BEFORE IT FOR NEW DAMS AND STORAGE PROJECTS THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE PUBLIC BENEFITS. AND IF THEY DON'T THEY CAN'T BE FUNDED UNDER PROP ONE THERE ARE SOME WHO NEVER READ THE LANGUAGE AND WHO WOULD LIKE TO RE WRITE% IT NOW. BUT THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE LANGUAGE IT WAS PASSED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT THE WATER COMMISSION IN THE GOOD JOB THAT THEY'RE DOING SO FAR. IN REVIEWING THESE PROP ONE APPLICATIONS AND I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS INVESTED IN A NICE JOB AS USUAL VERY GRATEFUL LET'S SEE. TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER LEADER. JOHN THE AS YOU KNOW THAT. I WENT OVER THE WATER COMMISSION WITH FOUR THOUSAND TITIAN'S. AND I'M AM I MEAN I'M JUST SIMPLE HERE. YOU KNOW I'M I'M A FARMER AND I MORE WATER IS BETTER. WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT MORE WATER. SO I SUPPORT THE WATER BORNE MY WHOLE DISTRICT VOTED AGAINST THE WATER BODIES I BELIEVE IS GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. AND YOU KNOW SITES RESOURCED OFF. SOLID DAM ON THE ON THE RIVER IT'S WATERED AS CAN BE STORED OFF SITE TO AL ACTUALLY HELPS THE THERMAL LEGAL PROCESS WHERE YOU'RE PUTTING WARM WATER IN THERE SO. YOU KNOW FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. THE RANKINGS WERE VERY GOOD TO COME TO THE WATER SO I WENT OVER THERE AND YOU KNOW SAID LOOK WE WE NEED TO HAVE A PROCESS HERE THAT. WAS TRANSPARENT WHAT WE REALLY SOLD THE VOTERS WAS WE WERE GOING TO CREATE MORE WATER. THAT'S WHAT I WANT OUT SOLEMN AND AND YES THERE IS. LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT. IT SAYS HAS TO BE PUBLIC BENEFITS SO. I'M HOPING THAT AT SOME POINT. WHEN THE THE ALL JUST GET DONE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN CREATE MORE WATER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DID IT IN SCENARIOS WHERE WE HAVE. CLIMATE CHANGE WHERE WE'RE GETTING. LESS SNOW WHICH IS THE BIGGEST RESERVOIR WE HAD. IN THE WHOLE SIERRA'S. AND MORE RAIN DOWN THERE THAT WE CAN CAPTURE SOME OF THAT AND HELP TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE DELTA PROBLEMS AND IN THE FISHERIES. GONNA COMMENT ON THAT YEAH. I THINK EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR RAINFALL THERE WAS ONE OF THE COULD HAVE BEEN. CAPTURED. BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT YOU TO THE COMMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN FISH AND WILDLIFE ROAD ON SITES WHICH WERE AN EYE OPENER. BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL THEY SAY YOU CAN OPERATE IT BUT IF YOU ALLOW THE FLOWS NEED FOR SAM AND YOU WILL BE DIVERTING FAR FEWER THE DAYS AND MONTHS AND EVEN WATERTIGHT PEERS. THAN YOU THINK SO WITHOUT GOING INTO THAT I WOULD JUST POINT TO THAT. COMMENT LETTER BACK IT WAS A REAL EYE OPENER FOR US. PLEASE THIS ONE LAST COMMENT AS. MAYBE TOO MUCH COMMON SENSE% AGAIN I DON'T KNOW OR SOME IT IS VERY SIMPLE AND AND NOT EDUCATED ENOUGH AND MAYBE. YEAH WE HAVE WE SOLD THE PUBLIC ON A LOT OF BONDS AND IN PROJECTS THAT. NEVER COME TO FRUITION THAT THAT. THAT DON'T. SOLVE WHAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE. AND I THINK AT SOME POINT WE ARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC. BUT WE'RE LOSING PUBLIC TRUST REALLY FAST AS LEGISLATIVE BODY BEEN IN WHO GET CAUGHT UP IN COURTS AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS WE DON'T PRODUCE WHAT WE SAY WE'RE GOING TO PRODUCE. AND I THINK AT SOME POINT WE'VE WE'VE RUN A RISK THAT THE PEOPLE ON THE FACE OF THIS ANYMORE WE DON'T WE'RE NOT ABLE TO ASK THEM FOR THE RESOURCES TO GET THE JOB DONE WHEN YOU GET DOWN. NO THANK YOU MR LEADER AND NEVER SIMPLE IT WHATSOEVER AND JUST GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE AND FOR YOUR FEEDBACK AS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH. PLEASE REST HERE WELL AND AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO OUGHT TO FOCUS ON WATERSHEDS BECAUSE AS WATER AS SNOW. THE BLUE SNOW PACKED WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT WATER COMING DOWN TO THE SIERRAS AND. THAT THE ISSUE ABOUT SOME THE TUNNELS AND IN THE HYDROLOGY THROUGH TE DELTA. AS WE MOVE WATER MORE QUICKLY THROUGH THE DELTA WHICH IS PART OF THE PLAN WE ALSO PULLED OUT OF THE SEARS FASTER WHICH RAISES THE TEMPERATURE THE WATER WHICH IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE FISH SO THAT. THE AND A LOT OF THE THE FOLKS WERE LOOKING AT THE HYDROLOGY THE DELTA REALLY ARE NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE UPPER WATERSHEDS WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WEEK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A REMARKABLE PICTURE AND SEE WHAT CAN RECOVER IF WE ARE WILLING. TO RETHINK HOW WE MANAGE WATERSHEDS AND HOW WE MANAGE THE SYSTEMS THAT THAT ALLOW THE FISH TO COME BACK INTO AND AS WE DEAL WITH THE. EFFECTS OF CHANGING. WATER PATTERNS TO THE STATE WHERE IT'S WARMER COMING AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN MANAGING THOSE FLOWS IT'S A VERY LARGE COMPREHENSIVE. ISSUE THAT NOT. EVERYBODY'S WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME ULTIMATE GOAL AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET. THE. YEAH THE TUNNELS IN THE DELTA WITHOUT LOOKING AT OTHER ASPECTS OF IT AND THAT'S REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT WE'RE ULTIMATELY TRYING TO LOOK AT BECAUSE THESE ARE ENTIRE SYSTEMS. THAT WE TEND TO KIND OF PIECEMEAL OUT AS WE DO PLANNING AND AND LOOK FOR THEMSELVES. JUST THE SUCCESS OF THE ROGUE HOPEFULLY THE KLAMATH. OTHER SYSTEMS. AS WE MANAGE ALL OF THAT WATER I THINK WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER SHOT OF MEETING. MULTIPLE NEEDS THAT AND THAT MEANS THAT THE FISHERIES AS WELL AS WE DO. IS WE REALLY DO RESTORATION TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE THAT WE HAVE CONFERENCES SOLUTIONS. I. THINK IN THE COMMENTS BACK TO THE VICE CHAIR THAT ONE. IT'S GOOD TO LEADER DOLLY JUST ONE LAST COMMENT. AS YOU MANY KNOW THE NOTE DEMI LEGISLATORS THAT I WORKED ON FORESTRY ISSUES FROM DAY ONE THAT I CAME HERE AND YOU KNOW THE REAL. THE REAL. HEADWATERS ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WHERE WE HAVE A FORCE THAT IS. OVERGROWN OVERSTOCKED. DUE TO OUR SUPPRESSION OF FIRE FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS. AT THE PACE IS GOING TO DO PUT OUR MEADOWS IN OUR IN OUR FORCED BACK INTO SHAPE SO WE CAN ACTUALLY STORE HAVE CARBON SEQUESTRATION NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO STOP APPLE TRANSPIRATION PROMOTIONAL. BLOWN AWAY IN THE WIND AND ACTUALLY GET INTO THE GROUND AND IT OFFERS WERE COMES ON THE SPRINGS AND IT'S COLD AT THE RIGHT TIME YEAR. WE NEED TO MOVE AT A PACE HILL THERE TO. AND THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT OR ARE NOT THE AVAILABLE TODAY AND WE'RE SEEIN MAGNIFIERS NOW. I KNOW THAT THERE'S LIKE THIRTY SOME BILLS RENTED THIS LEGISLATOR TO DEAL WITH FIRE. THAT BUT WE DID IT TAKE A GOOD CLOSE LOOK AT OUR WATERSHEDS IN AND FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MANAGE THEM IN A WAY THAT WE DON'T FARM UP. SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY STORE CARBON AND AND WATER TO SAVE TIME. ABSOLUTELY. CANDIDLY IT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE LOOK AT AT STORAGE. AND WE HAVE SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR WATER SUPPLY IN THIS STATE. THAT COME FROM SO BACK IN AS WE SEE. FEWER AND FEWER SNOW DAYS AND. LYNCH CONDITIONS IN THIS YEAR WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE TO COME UP WITH A NEW WAY TO BE A STORE THIS WATER. THAT WILL NO LONGER COME FROM SNOW MELT. IN IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BRING IT TO WORK WITH SENSIBLE CUTS SOLUTIONS HAS GOT TO WORK BOTH FOR. THE ENVIRONMENTAL FRONT. OBVIOUSLY AT PROTECTING FISH WITHIN ALSO ARE A CON ME AS WELL SO DO APPRECIATE THAT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS RUSSIAN AND THANK YOU FOR STICKING AROUND. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO BE HAPPIER WITH LAURIE ONCE AGAIN. PROVIDING A CRAB UPDATE ON LAST YEAR IT WAS A SOMBER TONE WITH NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF GOOD NEWS TO SHARE THIS YEAR. I'M PLEASED AND DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THE GOOD NEWS THAT MANY INDIANS YOU'RE ALREADY AWARE OF. NAMELY THE THE SUCCESSFUL. EFFORT TO SECURE FISHERY DISASTER APPROPRIATIONS IN THE US CONGRESS. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GO OVER THE TIME LINE OF HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHAT WE CAN EXPECT IN THE FUTURE FOR THREE REASONS ONE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S HELPFUL. TO. SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND REGENERATED. AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS PLATFORM TO SHARE THIS MESSAGE WITH THOSE WHO ARE HERE AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING. OR WHO WILL BE WATCHING. THE OTHER REASON IS THAT. THERE'S A CLEAR MESSAGE THAT NEEDS TO BE CONVEYED THAT THE WORK IS NOT DONE. AND WHILE ONE FISHERY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN TAKING CARE OF THEIR MANY MORE THAT. HAVE NOT BEEN AND THOSE WHO WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO GIVE IT ALL THAT WE'VE GOT. AND THE THIRD REASON IS BECAUSE DESCRIBING THIS LABORIOUS PROCESS WHICH TOOK YEARS I HOPE MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE PROCESS IS BROKEN. AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND WE HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE. SO BACK IN THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NOVEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU CENTER OF OUR HELD A PUBLIC HEARING. REALLY MEETING. WITH FISHERMEN AND APARTMENT OF SUCH WHILE LIFE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS VERY CLEARLY AN IMPENDING. DISASTER THE ELEVATED LEVELS OF DEMO CAST IN THE CRIME. IN THE CRAB FISHERY. FAST FORWARD TO THE SPRING OF THAT YOU AND THE GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. SENDING A LETTER TO SECRETARY OF COMMERCE THAN PENNY PRITZKER. REQUESTING A FEDERAL FISHERIES ESTHER DECLARATION. OF THE SEASON WRAPPED UP. WAS CLEARLY A DISASTER WITH THE WITH IMPACT SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE FLEET IN INTO OTHER SECTORS. THEN OF COURSE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP AND LOSS. KELLY FELT BY SMALL THOSE FISHERMEN AND YOUNG THE NEW ENTRANCE OF THE CENTURY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENABLED ACCESS TO SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATION LOANS WHICH ARE HELPFUL BUT THEY WERE THEY WERE NOTHING BUT A A LIFELINE AND NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION. MANY TOOK ADVANTAGE THAT OPPORTUNITY. IN JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THREE DAYS BEFORE THE END OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SECRETARY PRITZKER DECLARED A FEDERAL FISHERY DISASTER FOR THE CALIFORNIA DUNGEON ISN'T ROCK CRAB SURGERIES. ON THIS ENABLES CONGRESS Â OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION TO. DISTRIBUTE FUNDS IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATE. WE. WE TOOK UNTIL AUGUST OF TWENTY S. SEVENTEEN BEFORE THE HOUSE. COMMERCE APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE APPROPRIATED ARE INCLUDED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE REGULAR ORDER APPROACH STILL. THAT WAS SOMETHING BUT CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH ON THOSE BEFORE ALL WEST COAST FISHERIES. AND WE HAD OUR HURRICANES STRIKES THE CARIBBEAN AND GULF COASTS. INTACT THE FISHERIES THERE. FINALLY AFTER LONG DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR FRIENDS IN THE SENATE. AND AND IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT. THAT THIS WAS A BIPARTISAN MULTISTATE EFFORTS WITH SENATORS. THE ENTIRE DELEGATES SENT A DELEGATION FROM ALASKA WASHINGTON OREGON CALIFORNIA COMING TOGETHER. TO KEEP THE THE NOISE UP AND ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE KNEW THAT THIS WAS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THEM. ON FEBRUARY EIGHTH SECRETARY. OF COMMERCE ROSS. DECLARED THREE FEDERAL FISHERY DISASTERS IN THE CARIBBEAN IN THE US VIRGIN ISLANDS PUERTO RICO IN FLORIDA ON FEBRUARY NINTH. THE SENATE PASSED THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR. WEST COAST FISHERY DISASTER'S DECLARED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE THREE HURRICANE DISASTERS. THAT. THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED THEY NEED TO BE APPROPRIATED IN THE OMNIBUS BUDGET DEAL WHICH IS DUE OUT MARCH TWENTY THIRD. ONCE THAT HAPPENS. THERE WILL BE A FORTY FIVE DAY CLOCKS THAT BEGINS THAT NOTION NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION WHERE THEY WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO SLICE OF THE PIE. BY ALL INDICATIONS THE AGENCY IS GOING TO DIVIDE IT UP. THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TOM. USING EXTRA SO LANDINGS VALUE AS THE BENCHMARK ESTIMATE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS SLICE TWELVE WAYS. IS GOINGTO PRODUCE FAR LESS THAN WHAT WAS ACTUALLY LOST BUT IN THIS CONGRESSIONAL CLIMATE. WITH WITH BUDGETS BEING THE WAY THAT THEY ARE AN APPROPRIATIONS BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SECURE. ON THIS IS GOING TO GO A LONG WAY I ESTIMATE THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO END UP COMING TO THE CALIFORNIA TENNIS CROWD SURGERIES. ONCE THAT HAPPENS THAT MONEY WILL BE APPROPRIATED TO THE PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION. WHICH WILL HANDLE OF CREATING WHAT'S CALLED THE DISTRIBUTION ALGORITHM WHICH WILL DETERMINE THE IN THE WAY THAT. ECONOMIC LOSS WILL BE DETERMINED AND HOW INDIVIDUAL SESSION WITH AND OTHER. INDUSTRY OPERATORS. INCLUDING. SEVERAL DIFFERENT SECTORS OF OUR ECONOMY WILL BE PAID OUT BY THESE DISASTER FUNDS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL REQUESTED BUT UNDECLARED FISHER DISASTERS FROM CALIFORNIA THAT ARE STILL PENDING. PARTICULARLY NOTEWORTHY ARE THE SEARCH FOR DISASTERS FROM OREGON WASHINGTON AND THE SALMON FISHERIES. THE. YOUR CHIN FISHERY IN CALIFORNIA THE STARTING PITCHER IN CALIFORNIA. AND I BELIEVE. THAT MY CALLING TO HIM DAVID GOLDBERG WAS SPEAKING ABOUT THAT A LITTLE LATER ON SO I WON'T STEAL ITS THUNDER. BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT THE JOB IS NOT DONE. THERE ARE THERE STILL PAIN AND HARDSHIP AN ECONOMIC LOSS THAN THE SPEEDING CARAVAN WE ARE. SO GRATEFUL FOR OUR FRIENDS IN DC. ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU. FOR FOR TAKING CARE OF THIS FLEET TIME WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE. HOUSES WANT TO POINT OUT THAT IT TOOK ME SO. YOU KNOW WHAT ALL OF FIVE MINUTES JUST TO DESCRIBE HOW IT. HOW LONG IT HOW WE GOT HERE IT SHOULD TAKE THIRTY SECONDS BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS AN AUTOMATIC FUNCTION OF OUR FEDERAL AGENCIES AN APPROPRIATION SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC? SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CREATING ACTUARIAL SOLUTIONS FISHERY INSURANCE BASED SOLUTIONS. PERHAPS SOME SORT OF PILOT PROGRAM WITH THE PUB PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS. SOMETHING LIKE CROP INSURANCE WHICH IS A WELL ESTABLISHED. PROGRAM SO WE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE THE JOB IS NOT DONE BUT THANK YOU FOR GETTING US THIS FAR. INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH SIX ACRE TRACT OF GREAT FOR HERE THIS TURNED OVER TO MISS FRENCH PRESIDENT THE CENTRAL COAST WOMEN FOR FISHERIES MISS FRENCH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE TREK NORTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO FOUR SOURCE I BROKE A SPEED RECORD GETTING HER TO HUNT CAN PROSPER. I DID NOT SAY THAT OUT LOUD. OKAY TODAY I'M HERE. AS A VOICE OF CRABBERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO I'M GONNA BE REFERRING TO MY NOTES BECAUSE I'M USING THEIR WORDS. TODAY THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN ARE WORKING HARD ON WILL AND TANGLES RIGHT NOW DOWN OUR EFFORTS ARE SEEING GOOD RESULTS. BUT THE CENTER OF BIODIVERSITY IS USING RECORDS FROM THE SEASONS OF FOURTEEN FIFTEEN AND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. AS STANDARDS. OF FOR WELL ENTERTAINMENT WHEN WE ALL KNOW THAT THOSE SEASONS WERE NOT THE NORM. AND THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO HEAR THIS THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THOSE SEASONS WERE NOT THE NORM. WE WERE CLOSED. WE WENT FISHING ON APRIL FIRST THAT'S JUST WRONG. GRABBERS ANOTHER COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN ARE NOT OUT TO UNTANGLE WELLS CONTRARY TO WHAT IS BEING REPORTED IN THE MEDIA. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A. BAD EVERY POTENTIAL AVENUE USING THE BRACKET BEST PACK. I CAN TALK TODAY. USING THE BEST PRACTICES GUIDE WITH SHORTER TRAILER BOOZE POT RECOVERING. CUP RECOVERY AND REMOVING AS MANY OF THEIR GOAL LINES AS POSSIBLE FROM THE OCEAN WE'VE BEEN USING THESE METHODS PRO ACTIVELY FISHING WHERE THE WELLS AREN'T. SO FAR THEIR SEASON THERE ARE SO FAR THIS SEASON THERE HAS BEEN NO REPORTED WELL ENTANGLEMENTS ARM. THAT SHOWING THAT ARE PRO ACTIVITIES IS PAYING OFF. WE URGE PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT CONFIRMED ENTANGLEMENTS ARE NOT THE SAME AS REPORTED IN TANK ONCE. EACH PORT IS GOING OUT OF THEIR WAY WITH NO REIMBURSEMENT TO PICK UP ANY LOSS GEAR IT'S A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. TO CALL YOUR NEIGHBOR BOW AND SAY HEY I FOUND YOUR GEAR SUCH AND SUCH I LEFT IT AT SUCH AND SUCH TALK. WE DIDN'T NEED PEOPLE TO TELL US AS WE DID THIS OURSELVES BUT AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO ITS PRO ACTIVE. WE DO NEED A NEW WILSON SAYS THERE'S ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT POPULATION INCREASE PER YEAR. CURRENTLY MY OLDEST SON IS USING HIS WELL WATCHING VIDEOS. FOR. GATHERING DATES. GIRLS LIKE IT OKAY. WE CAN'T GO BACK AND. CHANGE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE PAST BUT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND FOR TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN AND WE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN ARE COMMITTED TO THAT. TRYING TO REDUCE THE WELL ENTANGLEMENTS. NEXT WE MOVE ON TO DO MORE GAS AT THE UGLY LITTLE BEAST. PLAIN AND SIMPLE WE NEED REALISTIC NUMBERS. GOING OFF A REALLY OLD OLD DATA FROM THE EIGHTIES IS JUST WRONG. SPORT FISHERMEN THAT WERE ALLOWED TO FINISH WHEN WE WERE CLOSED. DUE TO HIGH TO MORE GAS IN NUMBERS THERE WERE NO REPORTED ILLNESSES. SAFETY IS OUR FIRST CONCERN AND WE FISHERMEN WERE GROUND ZERO. ARE THE HEALTH. AND CONCERN FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. OF FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN AS YOU KNOW WAS CLOSED THAT SEASON IS STILL HAUNTING US. MEDIA MANAGES TO TROT OUT THE DEMOC ACID ISSUE. IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY ARTICLE. ON THE OPENING A CRAB SEASON BUT IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN OUR AND TEASING TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN SEASON WAS CLOSED DUE TO MORE GAS IT AND THEN THEY GO ON AND ON. WITHOUT IT'S LIKE. NO STOPPED OUT. VALID TWO'S BEEN. EFFECTING OUR CRAB PRICE. FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. AND WE DO WANT TO ASK THAT SOME OF THE DISASTER FUNDING GO FOR RESEARCH AND TESTING AND NOT NEW BUILDINGS. DOWN THE CRAB DISASTER FOUND. A BIG BIG BIG HEART FELT THANK YOU FROM THE CROWD FLEET. UP AGAIN MANY FAMILIES WERE. IMPACTED HEAVILY BY THIS OF. I HAVE A THIRTY YEAR OLD SON OUR DECK CANDU STILL LIVING AT HOME. THAT HE MOVED HOME DURING THE CLUB CRACKLE JOURNEYS STILL THERE. WE NEED TO GET OUR YOUNG GUYS. SOME FINANCIAL STABILITY SOME THESE YOUNG GUYS WENT OUT GOT SBA LOANS. OR THEY MADE THAT YEAR WAS THERE GO TO YEAR TO GET INTO THE INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE HURTING WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM THEY ARE OUR FUTURE. I OWNED. GENERAL OFTEN COMMENTS ON THE. LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. OBEY LOST ITS LAST OF PROCESSING FACILITY. ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO. THERE'S NO PLACE TO CUT FISH. THAT I KNOW OF COMMERCIALLY FROM MORAL BAY I DON'T KNOW IF SANTA BARBARA HAS ANY BUT THERE'S NOTHING NORTH THERE'S NOTHING SOUTH WE HAVE ONE ICE PLANT. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK WE HAVE ONE FUEL DOCK THAT. BLESSES HART. BECAUSE THE COAST GUARD IN FISHING GAME IS HIS MAJOR CLIENTS. AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT WE WOULD HAVE ONE SMALL MARINE STORE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP OPEN. BECAUSE WE WANT YOU WHEN YOU NEED A LITTLE PART BUT OUR LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS GONE. JOHN. THE TOURISTS COME TO TOWN TO SEE THE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN WILL PRETTY SUGARS THERE. SOON THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANY COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN WERE NOT JUST PRETTY BOATS WHERE OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. IN TOWNS AND IN THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR OUR YOUNGER GENERATION. AND WE. WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO US. THE COMMERCIAL GUYS THAT ARE OUT FISHING. AS I SAID I'M THEIR VOICE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK MISS FRENCH WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VICE CHAIR IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HAVE DESPICABLE ITEMS. MAKING SURE THAT. ALL THE FISHERMEN THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH OUR PURSUIT PRODUCE PAINLESS FISH AND WILDLIFE COMMITTEE MEETINGS PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF INFRASTRUCTURE. THROUGH THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION. HAS A STRANGE ANY OF YOUR. FISHERMEN BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THAT BEING A PROVIDE FEEDBACK BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU JUST MENTION IS THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE. IS IMPACTING THE FLEET. YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. THE ONE IN ATASCADERO CAME UP AND WHEN I WAS TAKING CARE OF MY MOTHER LONG. SO I DIDN'T GET TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT ONE. I WAS PLANNING ON CONTACTING THEM THAT'S GREAT BEYOND GIVING HIM JUST. A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIDE. I DON'T HAVE HIS I WAS HEARTENED TO HEAR THAT. THEY'RE HEARING US AND YOU'RE SEEING IT. ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THE OTHER ITEM THAT I NEED TO ENSURE IS THAT THAT WHILE IT IS FANTASTIC NEWS THAT A FISH WILDLIFE HAS THE FUNDING. THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE RECEIVING AND THEY RECEIVED FUNDING LAST YEAR FOR THEIR SIGHTED TOMORROW CASSIE TESTING WITH US AND YOU CONTINUE TO FUND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. RIGHT AND IN THAT. THAT WAS A CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD LAST YEAR. THAT FISH WILDLIFE WAS FUNDED DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WAS NOT. KNOW THAT THINGS MAY BE CHANGING THIS YEAR HERE BUT I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER. BIG ENEMY FOCUSES THOSE TWO ARE ATTACHED AT THE HIP. AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR TEAMS WORKERS ARE DOING ON A SHOESTRING AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU TO THE. TWO CRABBERS WHO GO OUT AND ACTUALLY COLLECT THE TEST TRAPS AND BRING HIM BACK IN. THINK THAT'S THE OTHER PIECES THAT MAKE SURE THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IS FULLY FUNDED. FOR FUN GOING TEST. IS THIS WHEN I TELL YOU NOW THAT THE CROWD THAT YOU HAD LAST NIGHT WAS FOUR HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION TO MORE GAS IT HEY I DID. NO SAID I COULD SEE THAT. IT WAS. WE USE A WHISTLE. DOES THAT WORK OF OUR STATE AGENCIES. AS WHEN IT WAS GOING OFF THE STOMACH. BUT YOU FORGET YEAH THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE CRAFT WAS IT WASN'T HARD WAS NOW IT'S YEAH IT'S GREAT. EVERYBODY'S GOOD EVERYBODY'S GOOD HERE. BUT I THINK THAT ON THAT DAY DPH THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FUNDED AS WELL AND IT HAS BEEN THAT. THE CONCERNS. OF SO THEY HAVE. SO TO SAY THANK YOU CAN BOTH YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK GRATEFUL FOR YOUR CLOSING COMES EFFECT. VANCE. DOES NOT OVER. OTHER FISHERIES ARE CONTINUING TO HURT. EVERYBODY.

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES REGARDS IS STARTING INDUSTRY WITH A NINETY SEVEN PERCENT DECLINE MEXICO. UP THROUGH CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WITH PERMITTING IS WELL COMPLIANCE. IN OBVIOUSLY ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES UPDATING DEVELOPMENT PERMITS OUT WITHIN SPECIFIC BASE IS WELL SO WHY DON'T WE TURN IT OVER TO MR GOLDBERG TO BE ABLE TO KICK US OFF. THANK YOU MADAM. THAT MIX THANK YOU. THIS CHAIRMAN MIKE WEIR AND PLACED ON CHAIRMAN OF THE SYSTEM. CRAP CRAP. I AM A SECOND STRINGER. I KNOW THAT ROB WAS A SICK IT WAS THE FIRST TRAINER AND I'M SECOND STRINGER ON ON THE THE SARDINE SO. BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO JUST MOMENT. BRING TOGETHER BECAUSE THAT WE ARE SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS FOR. AND MY PUBLIC COMMENT WITH SARDINES IT THAT THEY ARE UNDER A DISASTER REQUEST AND ALONG WITH SALMON AND ALL WITH SEA URCHIN AS WELL AND SO I DO CHECK THE UNOVA WEBSITE. ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND SO SAYS PENDING. AND SO WHAT I WOULD REQUEST FROM THIS COMMITTEE IS TO SEND A LETTER TO THE SECRETARY OF COMMERCE WILL ROSS AND ALSO TO CHRIS ALL OVER AT NOVA. NATURI FISHERY SERVICE TO SEE IF WE CAN. DISLODGE THE THE PENDING AND MAKE IT TO A ECHO THAT THEY ARE. ARE DECLARED AS A STATE DISASTER CONSIDER DOING. MOVING ON THAT MEANS. IAN DIANE PUSHERS WHO RUNS THE COMPANY WITH FISH OR WHAT BUT FISH PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION ASKED. ME TO. MAKE THESE POINTS OVER A RELATIVELY QUICK SINCE I'M NOT A SARDINE THEM ENTRY ADVOCATE OR PERSON THAT WOULD KNOWS A LOT SO I'LL JUST READ THAT THE NOTES AND THAT IS. THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THE URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF NEAR SHORE WATERS. THIS INCLUDES. AND EXCLUDED AREA UNDER THE CURRENT STOCK ASSESSMENTS. AND THIS IS NOW RECOGNIZED AS A SERIES OF MISSION SO. THAT WITH IF THEY DO GET DISASTER RELIEF. THE WILL USE THE SOME OF THE FUNDS FOR A. A BENEFICIAL FOR COOPER RESEARCH PROGRAM TO ASSESS THE BIOMASS WHERE AS. SEVENTY EIGHTY PERCENT IN THE CATCHES FOR THAT WAS THAT WAS THAT A CAR SO THAT'S NOT INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT ENSURE BIOMASS. STOCK ASSESSMENTS. AND THE SOLICITATION HAS RECEIVED A SMALL CONTRACT FOR THE SOUTH WAS FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TO HELP FUND THE PILOT SURVEY INVOLVING FISHMAN AND SPOT A PILOT TO VALIDATE THE CALL. COOPERATIVE AREA AERIAL SURVEY. THAT'S NOW BEING CONDUCTED IN ARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE SO THIS CONTINUING WORK WILL HELP THE FISHERY IMPROVED THEIR STOCK ASSESSMENTS. THOSE OF THE MAIN POINTS THAT THE STOCK ASSESSMENTS ON THE THE BIOMASS WAS WAS MISSED. AND THAT THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM OF THE FISHERY A DISASTER FUNDS BEING USED TO HELP COLLECT THAT INFORMATION. NOTHING SO MUCH AS A COMPARABLE FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON THAT AND ALSO POPE WITHIN THE LETTER AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THAT TONY SURE IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE ASSOCIATION. AND. GRATEFUL FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE ALSO UPDATING US ON ISSUES OF THE SERBIAN FISHERIES WELL. KNOW. HOW YOU ARE OKAY THROWS ALL ROB NO WORRIES NO WORRIES? THE GENERAL THE GENTLEMAN DID IT WILL THOUGH I THINK. BASICALLY I. WANT TO BE THANKFUL TO A GREAT MANY THAT OUR THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY CONTRACTING BECAUSE OF OF THE CONTRACTION OF WATER RESOURCES AND LAND RESOURCES IN. THE SAME THINGS THAT ALL THE OTHER FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE SO THE ONLY THING WE CAN. HOPE FOR IN THE FUTURE IS TO MOVE INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN WHICH IS A SMALL BODY OF WATER WE MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH. WHERE WE COULD GROW AN IMMENSE AMOUNT IN FISH WE ESTIMATED IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BY EACH? THURS PROBABLY SOMETHING EASILY. WITH A VERY RELATIVELY SMALL MODERATE DENSITY OF FISH FARMS OFF SHORE THE POSSIBILITY OF CREATING A ONE TO TWO BILLION DOLLAR. SHOULD FOR BILL YOU'VE. FISHERY THAT PROBABLY HAD A CERTAIN ECONOMIC VELOCITY OF ABOUT FOUR WHICH WOULD PUT IT TO APPROACHING TEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER TIME EMPLOYING. GOODNESS SEVERAL TEN THE BOOK FOR ABOUT TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IS A IS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE. THING THAT HAS THE JOB OF OURFUTURE THE TO OUR PROHIBITS OR STOPS OR CONSTRAINS OUR FUTURE. IS THE LACK OF THE THE. PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THAT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO EVEN GETTING A PERMIT ANYWHERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO DO OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE ESPECIALLY MARINE OR A MARINE FINFISH AQUACULTURE. ON AND WE HAVE TO DATE WE HAVE. TO THANK. A DIRECTOR BONHAM AND OR A. COCKLE CULTURE COORDINATOR RANDY OVER THERE. FOR FINALLY GETTING THIS PROGRAM IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN REVISE THE FOURTH VERSION. OF THIS DOCUMENT THAT IS TAKEN AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED. NOW BUS SOMEWHERE IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU COUNT IT FROM WHERE IT STARTED FOURTEEN OF. AND DO FOURTEEN YEARS ELEVEN TO AT LEAST ELEVEN AS MANY AS FOURTEEN YEARS. SO WE'RE GETTING UNDER WAY AND AND THE PROMISE TO GET THAT DONE BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR ACCORDING TO CHUCK IS JUST. AMAZINGLY GOOD NEWS FOR US SHOULD WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS. AND ON. TOP OF. THAT'S JUST THAT'S THE MAJOR THING I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT AND I THINK IT'S A POSITIVE AND BRIGHT OUTLOOK FOR US. QUICK QUESTION IN YOU KNOW WE WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS STUFF DEVELOPING A PRE PERMITTING PROGRAM. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT AS WE'VE LOST BUSINESS. CLEAN UP NORTH. ANY OTHER YOU WANNA GIVE US AN UPDATE ON ANY ISSUES ON MOVEMENT OF PRE PERMITTING BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN. ONE OF THE BEST LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY MOVE FORWARD WITH THE INSURED THAT OPTICAL TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE. ARE YOU REFERRING TO LIKE THAT SHOW. THIS PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FROM WELL OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE WELL SUITED TO THAT. BECAUSE THE WHOLE IDEA WOULD DISPERSE THEM AWAY FROM MANAGEMENT GROUPS LIKE HUMBLED. AND VENTURA AND SAN DIEGO THAT MARVELOUS SHELLFISH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO GET ME WRONG THOSE GUYS ARE DOING A SWELL JOB. BUT BUT. BUT OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE IS GOING TO BE A LARGE SCALE INTERPRET NOURIEL ENTERPRISE IS GOING TO TAKE SOME BIG BOYS TO GET IN THERE. AND INVEST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WHICH IS A PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE P. R. BUT WE'RE HAND WE ARE WORKING WITH IT. MEXICO'S PROGRAM IS WORTH WHAT. HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPMENT ALSO IN ORDER TO OBSERVE MY I'VE BEEN A CONSULTANT TO TWO OTHER PROJECTS ONE OF THEM IS A. INTENSE. PACIFIC ARE A PACIFICO. LOCAL CULTURE PACIFICO AND AND SO NOT IN THE OTHER ONE IS A. WHO ARE CRITICAL OF THE SEA THAT'S AS IN ENGLISH? NAME INTO A POSITIVE BUT CONSULTANT TO BOTH OF THOSE PEOPLE HELPING TO BUILD THEIR HATCHERIES. AND DOING SOME ANALYSIS OF OF OF HOW OF OF WHAT THE THE PROCESS PROFILE LOOKS LIKE TO GO FISHIN HOW MUCH MONEY PER SQUARE. METER CAN YOU GET ECCENTRIC CENTER TO CENTER. OF. THE PRODUCTION MATRICES AND OTHER DOING ALL THEY'RE DOING VERY WELL THERE ARE PROBABLY SIX DOWN IS SIX OTHER FIRMS NOW JOAN IN THE SOUTHERN. IN IN SOUTHERN IRAQ IN THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SEA OF CORTEZ AND THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHERS ON ON SHORE IN THE WEST COAST OF. MEXICO THAT MEANS MEXICO MAINLAND AND THERE ARE OTHERS ON THE EAST COAST. CHICAGO HAS BEEN A VERY PROACTIVE TALK WILL OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE PROGRAM LOOKING AT LOTS AND LOTS OF SPECIES SNOW IS STILL REALLY IN ITS INFANCY IS NOT REALLY EVEN TEN YEARS OLD. IT'S HARD TO SAY HOW MUCH MONEY IS KING BUT KNOWING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING. TO END IT. THEY'RE PRETTY SURE THEY'RE GONNA MIX OF WHAT IS SPEND DON'T DO THAT UNLESS THEY ARE UNDERSTANDING IT IS STILL A FLEDGLING INDUSTRY. MOSTLY DOMESTIC OR INTERNATIONAL ARE THEY SHIPPING IT OUT OF COUNTRY FOR CONSUMPTION WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO THEY SEE DOWN THERE OR WHAT. MARKET ACTUALLY ACTUALLY MEXICO'S GOT A A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS AND ONE OF THE GREATEST VICIOUSLY HAPPENS TO TWELVE A IT'S A VERY LARGE SEA BASS IN THE NORTHERN PART. OF THE GOAL OF THE GULF OF MEXICO THAT I HAD THE PLEASURE WORKING ON IT WAS GREAT FUN IT'S OFFICIALLY GROWS TO. WE WE GOT FISH THAT WE PROJECTED TO GROW TO ELEVEN POUNDS IN FOURTEEN MONTHS WHICH MAKES THEM AMONG THE FASTEST GROWING CHRISTIAN THE WORLD AND IT GAVE ME MUCH GEORGE A PROJECT THAT. ANYWAY. THE THE. COMPUTER MONITOR IS DOING THEM IN LARGE NUMBERS THERE STALKING LIKE FIFTEEN THOUSAND OF THEM IN AN ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM IN THE NORTHERN GULF. BECAUSE THE TWO TWELVE HE IS ALSO IN DANGER BUT IT WILL BE THERE AND SO IN THAT STATUS. PRESENT IT WOULD ONLY BE SOLD. TO A MEXICAN MARKET BUT MEXICO HAS A VERY DECENT FISH MARKET AT REASONABLE PRICES. AND SO THEY'LL DO FINE. UNTIL UNTIL THE EXPANDED SUCH AS THE EXTENT THAT THE THEY CAN THEY CAN EXPORT OF THESE ARE GREAT FISH THESE ARE JUST LIKE GIANT SEA BASS. IS GOOD AS YOU THEIR FISH QUALITY AS GOOD AS YOU CAN GET. THERE AND. LOTS OF LOTS AND LOTS OF OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THERE. THANK YOU THAT IS FANTASTIC AND I YEAH I I MEAN WE MENTION IT HERE AT OUR PREVIOUS HERE AND WANT TO GET AN UPDATE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE HEARING SO THAT SO. THAT'S ENCOURAGING WELL WE'RE WE'RE ALL WOULD I I'M I'M NOT JUMPING FOR JOY YET WELL BELIEVE IT WHEN I SEE IT BUT WHEN WE GET THIS DAMN THING. FINISHED WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR WE WILL HAVE AT LAST THE BEGINNING WE DON'T LIKE THE PP I ARE AT ALL OR THE THINGS IN IT FOR THE BILL THE PROPAGATED IT. BUT WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO ENGAGE IT UNTIL THIS P. E. R. IS OVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SURE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE. TURN OVER TO I NOW MISTER GREAT DEAL FROM COAST SEAFOOD HE'S GOING TO GIVE US AN UPDATE ON ALL ISSUES OF SHELLFISH AND COMING TO US FROM THE CLEANERS BAY WATER IN THE STATE. REQUIRE. BUY SHARES. STONE ARMED I I I GOTTA SAY THIS. ALL AT LEAST TWO FISHERMEN ELEVEN POUNDS. THAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT I DESCRIBE A FISH IS THIS IS THIS IS MY FISH AND A LOT OF GROUND. OFFICIAL. BUT FOR FIREPLACE.

AND JOHN ON JOHN'S RESTAURANT HE'S GOT MULTIPLE RESTAURANTS IN THE NAPA VALLEY SAN FRANCISCO THEY SELL ABOUT SIX MILLION OYSTERS A YEAR. ON THEIR HOPING TO DOUBLE THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS SO. TWELVE MILLION OYSTERS THEY CAN GROW ABOUT THREE MILLION SO HE IS IMPORTANT. OYSTERS FROM ALL LITERALLY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. ON TO TO MEET THAT DEMAND. I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF HIS ONE OF HIS CUSTOMERS AND AND. WHEN THIS IS ONE OF ITS SUPPLIERS. WE'D WE'D LIKE TO FIX THAT WE THINK WE CAN GROW MORE SHELLFISH IN THIS STATE. ARM IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE EAST COAST. WHO WHO HAS EMBRACED THE GROWTH OF THEIR INDUSTRY THEY'RE ISSUES GROWN BY TWENTY TO FIFTY PERCENT EVERY YEAR IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS? ARM AND THEIR THEIR ORCHARDS OR ARE INCREDIBLE. THEIR SHELLFISH IS DOING QUITE WELL THERE AUG AND CONSEQUENTLY THE WATER QUALITY IS IS BENEFITING FROM IT. BOMBS. SO THE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS WORKED TOWARDS. ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE GROWTH CONCERNS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO. WE'VE APPROACH AGENCIES ON ASKS FOR HELP. IN THE PERMITTING SIDE OF IT THAT'S REALLY THE THE MAIN BARRIER ON AND DOING THIS IN A PROGRAMMATIC OR A MORE COORDINATED EFFORT INSTEAD OF DOING IT INDIVIDUALLY TO DO. TO DO IT. INTO PROGRAMMATIC FASHION OFF. I THINK. THE I THINK MOSTLY AGENCIES WOULD AGREE IT'S MORE EFFICIENT TO DO IT THAT WAY AND IT'S MORE EFFICIENT FOR BOTH THE APPLICANT AND THE AGENCIES. ON THE THE CURRENTLY THE THEIR COASTAL COMMISSION FELL FOR IT BECAUSE COMMISSION IS WORKING THROUGH. ADDRESSING OUTDATED OR OR NONCOMPLIANCE ISSUES WITH THE CDP'S AROUND THE STATE FOR SHELLFISH. BOMB AND THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE THINK AND I BELIEVE THEY BELIEVE. COULD BE DONE PROGRAMMATIC GLEE. AND SO WE ARE STRONGLY SUPPORTING THE PRESERVATION PRESIDENT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. TO. TO ADD TWO ADDITIONAL. EMPLOYEES TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND GAME OFFICIAL WHILE LIFE FALTERS. FOR THE AWFUL TO PROGRAM. AND WE ASK THAT YOU YOU BOTH SUPPORT THAT ON. THAT BUDGET REQUEST IF POSSIBLE. WE SEE. WE SEE THE DEPARTMENT DOING GOOD THINGS AS AS IT GOES FORWARD. WE JUST WANNA HELP. WE ALSO FEEL THAT AS A STATE WE SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY IN WHICH WE CAN. CANNOT PUSHING. CULTURE OFFSHORE INTO FEDERAL WATERS. I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. IN THE EFFORT TO EDUCATE AND EXPLORE OPTIONS WE ARE ARE GRATEFUL TO. BOTH CHAIRS OR VICE DO GERM REQUIRED VICE CHAIR STONED FOR. ASSISTING IN SPONSORING A A BRIEFING AND RECEPTION ON APRIL SEVENTEENTH SACRAMENTAL. BOMB.

THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISS YOU VERY GRATEFUL. THAT LOOKS THE BEST HERE IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. TODAY I I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT THE IN THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE DID DISCUSS PARTICULAR AND SHELLFISH. ON THE DEMAND IS HUGE. IN THIS STATE ALONE. AND WE CAN'T GROW WHAT WHAT WE CONSUME AN ANNUAL BASIS I THINK WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN. TRYING YOUR DARNDEST IS. HOW WE CAN EXPAND CREATE LOCAL JOBS DO AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE WAY? IN LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THAT PRE PERMITTING OUT WITHIN SPECIFIC BAY WATERS STRATEGICALLY. AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN YOUR BEER TOPICAL AS. A WAY TO BE ABLE TO TO MAKE THIS WORK IN CALIFORNIA. YES IT IS AND AND I THINK WE'RE. WE'VE WE'VE HIT SET BACKS BUT I THINK WE'RE CONTINUING TO. TO GROW IN OUR. IN OUR. ABILITY TO DO THAT SOMETIMES I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER TO FIX THE OCEAN. IS EXCELLENT GOVERNMENT BUT ON. MY STAND I STAND READY TO TRY. A THE SUBMISSIONS TO DO WE'RE GRATEFUL THANK YOU FOR PITCH IN A GAME WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOU WERE HERE TODAY THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. MAKE A GREAT JOB.

AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECOND PROF. GOOD AFTERNOON. BUDGETS RECENTLY. CORRECT DRIVING TRIP FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DOWN TO SAN DIEGO STOPPING IN THE HARBOR SOME STUFF ON THE WAY TO TALK TO THE FISHERMEN. ARE. STATED THERE CAN FISHERY IS IN DIRE TROUBLE RIGHT NOW. WERE DOWN EIGHTEEN NINETY PERCENT SOME OF OUR AREAS. OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE HAVEN'T HAD ANY KILLED FOR THREE YEARS NOW. WE GOT A LITTLE BIT THIS YEAR BUT. NOT ENOUGH THIS FALL THE DIVERS ARE OUT INTO A HUNDRED FEET OF WATER WERE PICKING URCHINS THAT ARE EATING BARNACLES. WHICH IS NOTHING ELSE FOR THEM TO EAT. WE'VE LOST A COUPLE DRIVERS TO THE BENDS ARE READY OF AIDS YOU KNOW IT'S. IN GOOD SHAPE. CENTRAL COAST OF THERE'S NO URGENCY HERBS AUTRES OF JUST WIPE THEM OUT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SANTA BARBARA THERE. IS A FEW GUYS WORKING. NOT VERY MANY THERE THERE'S SURGEONS BUT THEY'RE JUST NOT FINDING ANYTHING AT ALL RIGHT NOW THEY'RE JUST. THEY'RE JUST NOT IN VERY GOOD TO DO NOT. TIME OF GUILT. SAN DIEGO. DIVERS DOWN THERE THROUGHOUT IN DEEP WATER JUST LIKE THEY ARE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. PUSHING IN IN T DOING THOSE DEEP TIES AND WHICH ARE DANGEROUS OR DANGEROUS DIES. ON. THE WHOLE STATE IS THE SOURCE YOUR CHIN GOES IN PRETTY BAD CONDITION. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAD A PURPOSE EXPLOSION ALSO CAME ALONG WITH THE. EL NINO. AND. THERE ARE EATING ALL THE BABY KELP THAT WE'RE STARTING TO GET THE PURPLE URCHINS ARE JUST. DEVASTATING MAP SOMEWHERE KINDA GOT TWO FRONTS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. FROM THE EL NINO IS WINDING DOWN I I BELIEVE WE'RE COMING OUT OF IT ON. THE OCEAN CONDITIONS ARE. I JUST WENT THROUGH THIS EITHER THROUGH YOUR THIRD OR FOURTH EL NINO I'VE BEEN THROUGH I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE LAST THIS LONG BEFORE IS LISTED IN THE EFFECTS OF LAST THIS LONG. WE'RE HOPING WE'RE HOPING. THAT IT'S KIND OF STREET KNOWLEDGE BUILT. ON. BUT WE WOULD LIKE FROM YOU GUYS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IS REALLY HELP US PUSH THIS DISASTER THING THROUGH. WE ARE A LOT SLOWER PROCESSORS THE END FROM OUR PROCESSORS IN LOS ANGELES AREA HAVE SHUT DOWN HOPEFULLY THEY'RE GONNA OPEN BACK UP AGAIN. WHEN THE YOU WERE TO SAY. WHEN YOU ARE HAVING A ROBUST SEASON YOU BRING IN A HUNDRED PERCENT OF HARVEST IF YOU WILL MOVING. ARE YOU A TEN PERCENT OF NORMAL WHERE YOU AT. IT I MEAN THERE ARE SOME REGIONS THE STATE WE ARE NOT EVEN FOLKS AREN'T EVEN ABLE TO GO OUT JUST DESCRIBE IT PUT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US. WILL. IN FORT BRAGG USUALLY WE HAVE OF. MANY BOATS WORKING. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FOUR. EVERYBODY ELSE IS JUST HOLDING THEIR BREATH LOT OF GUYS ARE GREAT WOULD THEY BRING ENOUGH FOR THOSE FOUR BOATS BRINGING. WE USUALLY BRING UP THE ANYWHERE SOME A THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND POUNDS A DAY THE RING UP TWO TO THREE HUNDRED POUNDS A DAY IS WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY HARVESTING. AND THEN THE PERCENTAGES ARE DOWN ON AN AS IT SAID THEY WERE DRIVING DEEPER AND THE PURCHASE OR EATING BARNACLES. AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE YOU THERE'S KIND OF LATE THEY WENT. ALL THE CONFINED. THAT'S THE STATE OF IT. AND. IT'S NOTHING YOU ARE IS SO WITH THAT HELP. YOU OR NOT SEEN. REPLENISH WHAT SO YOU'RE NOT SEEN THEM GROW IT'S IT'S IT IS BEEN. NOT BEEN A MARKED IMPROVEMENT SINCE THE LAST TIME WE TALKED WELL THERE IS ACTUALLY. THIS YEAR LONG SAW SMALL LITTLE AREAS WHERE THERE WAS SOME SPORTS CAME OUT. THAT'S THAT'S A SIGN THAT ALL NEED A WINDING DOWN. OF WHAT WE NEED THIS FOR THE KILL WE NEED THIS SPRING IS HAVE A COLD WATER. ON HIM THING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET THE NORTHWEST WINDS BLOWING A BLOW THAT WARM WATER OFF THE SURFACE IT BRINGS OUT. A NUTRIENT RICH COLD WATER IN THE DEEP IF WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE OF GETTING MORE KILLED. AND THAT'S WERE ALL HOPING AND PRAYING FOR. IN MY IGNORANCE AND I APOLOGIZE SO FROM THE TIME YOU GET TO SAY BYE. KNOCK ON WOOD. WE SEE THAT TOO. REPLENISHMENT OF WHAT DOES NOT FORCE IF YOU WILL USE TO LOOK LIKE WHAT'S TIMELINE ON THAT. A COUPLE YEARS PROBABLY TO GET READY REALLY BACK TO IT IF WE DO GET KILLED. FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE GOOD CALC FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. THE SECOND YEAR GETS BETTER THE FIRST YEAR WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE URCHINS TIME TO GO THROUGH THE FIRST YEAR. JUST. STRUGGLING WITH IT BUT IT IS GETTING BETTER BY THE SECOND YEAR THEY'RE USUALLY BETTER THEIR FIRMED UP. SO IT TWO YEARS AT MINIMUM. IN JUST LOOKING AT THE. THE LANDINGS REAL QUICK FORT BRAGG HERE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS A LITTLE OVER ONE POINT THREE MILLION POUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THREE TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND. IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SANTA BARBARA AREA ALMOST FOUR POINT NINE MILLION POUNDS OTHER DOWN TO ONE POINT SIX MILLION. LAST YEAR IT'S THIS MASSIVE DECREASES PAUL MASSIVE MASSIVE. AND IT'S THIS IS REALLY DEVASTATING FOR THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESS IS WHAT IT IS AND IT'S. YOU KNOW OUR. MYSELF I PROCESSOR TUNES I USED TO WORK. IN BACK IN THE FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. I HAD SEVENTY EMPLOYEES I HAVE CAN NOW. SO THAT. AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE KEEPING THE TEN WORKING. SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE ONE OTHER THING PLACE. WE. WITH THE HELP OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WE DISCUSS REGULATIONS PASSED IS GOING TO HELP US GET THROUGH SOME THIS THING AND I WOULD LIKE TO. THANK FISH AND WILDLIFE FOR HELPING US THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRESSURE. THAT. JUST A COMMENT ON THE ON THE CAL AT THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL WELL IN THIS SUBCOMMITTEE ON COST OF PROTECTION WHICH IS A COMMITTEE THAT I HAVE HERE WE. HAD. PC AND TALK ABOUT YOUR GRASS AND CAL AND IT'S IT'S REALLY STARTLING TO SEE. SOME OF THE GRAPHICS ABOUT THE THE LOSS OF THE KELP FOREST WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING WRITERS THE URCHIN POPULATION BUT. IT'S ALSO SHOWING SOME SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FROM THE OCEAN CHEMISTRY STANDPOINT IF WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT. SHELLFISH AND HOW SHELLFISH GROW THEY THE CHEMISTRY NEEDS TO BE CORRECT. TO THEIR LOTS OF DIFFERENT LAYERS TO THE. THE LOSS OF THE KELP FORESTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY IMPACTING THE FISHERIES THERE. BUT CHANGING THE THE CHEMISTRY PREVENTING THE LACK OF THE FORCE PREVENT SOME OF THE BUFFERS THAT WE NEED. AND AS THE WE GET MORE CARBON IN THE OCEAN. CHANGING THAT THAT CHEMISTRY AND STARTING TO PROVIDE SOME A LITTLE BIT MORE ACID IN WHATEVER SMALL AMOUNTS BUT IT CAN BE DEVASTATING. TO OYSTERS TO SHELLFISH PRODUCTION OF ANY KIND. THESE ARE THESE ARE VERY COMPLICATED BUT IN A RELATED ISSUES AND FINDING WAYS TO PUT. THE THE ALLERGIES BACK IN THE OCEAN AND GET THEM TO GROW IS IS GOING TO HELP US ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS SO IT'S A IT'S A BIG ISSUE THAT WE NEED A LOT MORE SCIENCE ON. AND TO BE LOOKING A LOT MORE CLOSELY. ABSOLUTELY. THEY. WERE NOW. GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE LISTED THE EXACT ADDRESS COULD HAPPEN BASICALLY MARKETING ASSOCIATION HERE THAT YOU HAVE TO FOR FIVE MINUTES THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I CAN GET FUZZY THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK PARTICULARLY RETRIEVAL. THANK YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING TIME OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AS WELL I WANT TO THANK YOU. JIM ACQUIRE VICE CHAIR STONE AND I THINKS MR WAS LOW FOR ASKING ME TO BE HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO WEAR MANY HATS IN THE COMMERCIAL FISHING COMMUNITY OF HALF MOON BAY. AND TODAY OVER TO. TO SPEAK TO TO SPECIFIC SECTIONS OF THE FISHERIES OMNIBUS BILL. ON MY DAUGHTER SISTER HAD TO. B. TO SECTION FIVE AND MY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HALF ME SEAFOOD ARKETING ASSOCIATION HAD. TO SPEAK TO SECTION EIGHT. SO FIRST ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY AND OTHERS I ASKED THE SUPPORT UPDATING THE LANGUAGE. THAT A DAY IN THE CALIFORNIA HOW THE TRANSFER ABILITY AS SUGGESTED IN SECTION FIVE WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT LANGUAGE. I COME FROM A COMMERCIAL FISHING FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN FISHING OUT OF HALF MOON BAY FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS. AND TIMES HAVE CHANGED. AND WE'VE WORKED HARD TO CHANGE WITH THEM. TO SUCCESSFULLY ADAPT TO NEW REGULATORY SYSTEMS SUCH AS QUALIFYING FOR MAINTAINING A CALIFORNIA HAVE IT PERMIT. SINCE THAT FISHING BECAME LIMITED ENTRY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. I REALLY APPRECIATE VICE PRESIDENT WILLIAMS COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE. BE REALLY EASY TO GET INTO THE WEEDS HERE WHICH BELIEVE ME I DID WHEN DRAFTING THESE REMARKS. BUT IT'S LATE IN THE DAY AND I WANT TO DO THAT TO YOU AND. I HAVE ANOTHER HAD TO PUT ON IN A MINUTE SO I JUST WANT TO SHOW THREE PRINCIPLES THAT I THINK ARE REALLY. IMPORTANT TO ALL AREAS OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THIS ISSUE AND PRINCIPLE ONE IS THAT COMMERCIAL FISHING BUSINESSES NEED LEXIBILITY TO SURVIVE. OVER THE YEARS FISHING BUSINESSES LIKE ALMOST EVERY OTHER BUSINESS HAVE TO ADAPT. IN OUR INDUSTRY THAT COULD INCLUDE THE NEED TO CHANGE VESSELS HAVE A SAFER FISHING PLATFORM. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FOUR DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THIS WITHOUT A VESSEL BEING DESTROYED. AND THAT'S FORCING PARTICIPANTS OUT OF THE FISHERY. TWO REGULATIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED RATHER THAN USED AS A REASON TO PERPETUATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ARE THE TRANSFERABILITY RESTRICTIONS IN EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FOUR WERE PUT INTO PLACE PRIOR TO. THE COMMISSION ADOPTING A RESTRICTED ACCESS PROGRAM. TWELVE YEARS LATER WE STILL LIVE IN PRIOR TO LAND. IN THE RESTRICTIONS REMAIN WHICH WE'VE BUSINESSES FAMILIES AND THE INDUSTRY STOCK. AND THREE FISHERIES REGULATIONS SHOULD BE ABOUT MANAGING FISHERIES AND NOT PEOPLE. THE CURRENT SITUATION IS RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE CALIFORNIA HELMET FISHERY FOR NO BIOLOGICAL OR CONSERVATION REASON. SIXTY ONE PERMITS ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. THIRTY SIX AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. TO TWENTY FIVE HISTORICAL. HOW ABOUT FISHING BUSINESSES HAVE DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST TWELVE YEARS? AND I'M DOING MY BEST TO MAKE SURE MY FAMILY'S NOT NEXT. SO AGAIN. WHEN IT. BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT LANGUAGE IN THE OMNIBUS BILL TO. ALLOW THE COMMISSION STILL ACRID RESTRICTED ACCESS PROGRAM BUT ALSO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP FAMILIES AND BUSINESS. I'M GONNA CHANGE HATS FOR YOU NOW AND TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE HAPPEN A SEAFOOD MARKETING ASSOCIATION. ARE THIS IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION A FISHERMAN IN HALF MOON BAY WHO SHARE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO BEING A PRODUCTIVE UNIFIED VOICE FOR THEIR LOCAL INDUSTRY. I'M SPEAKING ONLY TO SECTION EIGHT OF THE OMNIBUS BILL ON LOST AND ABANDONED CRAB GEAR. WANNA BE CLEAR THAT THE HALF ME SEAFOOD MARKETING ASSOCIATION HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON ANY OTHER ISSUES. IN THE ON THE BUS AT THIS TIME. SO I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH THIS GROUP OF PROGRESSIVE FISHERMEN IN MY HOME PORT. US SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND OTHERS WE'VE CREATED AND MANAGED THE LOST FISHING GEAR RECOVERY PROGRAM AND A PORT FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. BOMB IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE POTENTIAL MARINE MAMMAL INTERACTIONS WITH GEAR AFTER THE CLOSURE OF DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON. ARE WE WERE DRIVEN TO DO THIS TO ENSURE THAT OUR FISHERY REPRESENTS THE VERY BEST IN OCEAN STEWARDSHIP. AND THAT'S BEEN SAID NO ONE WANTS WILL ENTANGLEMENTS LEAST OF ALL FISHERMEN. MISS FRENCH IS CORRECT. COLLECTING MUST GEAR IS NOTHING NEW FISHERMEN HAVE BEEN CLEANING UP THE OCEAN ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS. FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. SO STILL THE FLEET HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE EFFORTS TO FORMALIZE AND STANDARDIZE EFFORTS FORGET RECOVERY. AND HOW WE FELT IN HALF A DAY AND STILL FEEL THAT THE INDUSTRY BEING INVOLVED IN THIS FROM THE GROUND UP IS WHAT'S GOING TO HELP BUILD LASTING SOLUTIONS. SO WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT OUR MODEL IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY MANAGED BY INDUSTRY. WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THE SUCCESS AND LESSONS LEARNED TO HELP INFORM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN. CONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE. OTHER THAN JUST CRAP TASK FORCE THAT IS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE RECOVERED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY LOS ANGELES CRAB POTS IN HALF MOON BAY. AND LAST YEAR BEGAN WORKING WITH FOUR OTHER CALIFORNIA PORTS TO HELP THEM CREATE OR GROW SIMILAR PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IT HAS DEFINITELY BEEN CHALLENGING TO GET TO A STATE MANDATED PROGRAM I'M DEFINITELY ENCOURAGED BY DIRECTOR BONHAM'S REMARKS ON THIS TOPIC EARLIER TODAY. ARM AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT INDUSTRY THE DEPARTMENT CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE THIS FINALLY HAPPENED. WE INHABIT MAY WILL CONTINUE TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY AND ADVOCATE FOR SUSTAINABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM THAT CAN BE. SUCCESSFUL IN ALL POOR COMMUNITIES SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LANGUAGE IN THE OMNIBUS BILL THAT PROVIDES DATE. OF JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY NINETEEN FOR THESE REGULATIONS TO BE DEVELOPED. AND FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE SUNSET DATE. YOU MENTION THAT I WOULD SPEAK TO THE F. PEAS AND THAT'S COOL I DIDN'T PUT THAT BUT I CAN DO THAT REALLY QUICKLY AND JUST LET YOU KNOW. I HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN. ANOTHER HAT SWITCH. THE GROUND FISH GROUP AND HAVING BAY HAS ON THE KHALFAN GROUNDFISH COLLECTIVE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN. ESP FOR ELECTRONIC MONITORING THE FEDERALLY MANAGED FISHERY FOR GROUNDFISH AND THAT PROCESS THAT IS ALLOWED THROUGH THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. ALLOWS REAL ON THE WATER TESTING OF. IN THIS CASE TECHNOLOGY BUT IT COULD BE OTHER THINGS. PRIOR TO REGULATIONS BEING AN ACTIVE AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S PLACES WHERE WE TALK ABOUT GETTING STUCK IN CALIFORNIA HAD WE DONE SOME YES HE'S. ARE EXEMPTED OR EXPERIMENTAL FISHING PERMIT WORK ON THE WATER PRIOR MIGHT HAVE SAVED US SOME OF THESE REWORKS. BECAUSE IT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN. THE REGISTER THE REGULATIONS ARE INFORMED BY ON THE WATER EXPERIMENTATION. SO I JUST. GUESS THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THAT BUT I CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. STRANGE. SEVEN GIVING QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO. SO I THINK THE YOU YOU. HAVEN'T BAY YOU'VE REALLY BEEN A LEADER ON THE COUNTER EFFORT AND THEN NOW MIGRATING RIGHT AT A TURNING THIS. RETRIEVAL PROGRAM INTO A STANDARDIZED SYSTEM OF A DOWN THE COAST. ALWAYS ASK THE QUESTION IS. WHERE DO YOU FIND MOST STUFF FOLKS HAVE LOST IT BASED OFF OF WEATHER CONDITIONS? OR INTERNED IN IMPORTANTLY DISCUSS THEM OUT THERE TALK ABOUT TRENDS THAT YOU SEE. IN REGARDS TO YOUR FINDINGS. WE'VE WE'VE REALLY FOUND THAT AND YOU KNOW LOST GEAR IS A PART OF COMMERCIAL FISHING FOR DUNGENESS CRAB. IT HAS BEEN FOR EVER SINCE BEARS ROAM FREE. YES IT'S BEEN FOR YOU KNOW I ALWAYS A PART OF THE FISHERY SO WHAT WE'RE FINDING IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING THE FISHERMEN DO ON PURPOSE. THERE'S SOME OCCASIONAL. LOTS OF IT OUT THERE BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT'S THE STRAGGLERS POTS TO GET SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE STRING. POTS THAT ARE MOVED BY WHETHER POTS THAT ARE MOVED BY ANOTHER VESSEL A SHIP. AND THEY GET LEFT AND THERE'S A PERCENTAGE. IN PARTICULARLY STORMY YEARS THIS YEAR WE SAW MORE THAT WE RECOVERED THEN IN THE YEAR PRIOR BECAUSE IT WAS A REALLY STORMY YEAR. AND WEATHER CONDITIONS MEANT THAT MORE GEAR WAS LOST. WE ALSO IND THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FISHERMAN THAT WE CONTACT ARE REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR FROM US. PLEASE THAT WE FOUND THEIR GEAR HAPPY TO REIMBURSE THE PROGRAM TO GET THEIR GEAR BACK. ON THAT THAT WAS GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS SO HAVE YOU HAD ANY RESISTANCE. AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE FLEET IN PLEASE. PUSH BACK AGAINST ME IS THAT. NO ONE EVER WANTS TO UNTANGLE AWAY. THE LAST THING THAT. AND THE MORE PROACTIVE THE FLEET CAN BE THE BETTER OFF RIGHT. IT'S BETTER OFF FOR THE INDUSTRY FOR THE CONSUMER THIS KEEP GOING THROUGH IT. HAS THERE BEEN ANY PUSH BACK. IN REGARD TO HAVING TO. PAY TO GET TO BE THE CURE BACK. SURE I'M YOU KNOW. THERE'S ALWAYS SOME PUSH BACK RIGHT THERE'S ALWAYS A QUESTION OF WELL HEY UP FOR YEARS I'VE JUST PICK MYSELF UP ON THE DOCK. BECAUSE MY FRIENDS HAVE FOUND IT FOR ME AND NOW YOU WANT ME TO PAY FOR IT. WHAT WE'VE FOUND IS THAT THIS? THESE PROGRAMS DON'T PRECLUDE A FRIEND FROM PICKING UP HERE AND TELLING ANOTHER FRIEND ABOUT IT. IT JUST MAKES ANOTHER AVENUE FOR A FORMALIZED RECOVERY EFFORT TO GO OUT AND GET A LARGE AMOUNT OF GEAR. YOU KNOW DID YOU ADD A MONETIZATION TO IT THE FISHERMEN THAT RECOVER THIS GEAR. ARE INCENTIVIZED TO DO SO AND THE FLEET IS HAPPY TO GET THEIR GEAR BACK SO. YOU GET YOUR BACK AT A PRICE HOPEFULLY IN OUR MODEL AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN ABOUT. THE BROADER. LONG TERM MODEL THROUGH THE APARTMENT BUT IF IF A FISHERMAN CAN GET HIS GEAR BACK AT LESS THAN IT WOULD COST HIM TO REPLACE. KNEW. THE GEARS OUT OF THE WATER. THERE'S NO REST FOR AWHILE UNTANGLE MAN. AND. IT'S A LOST ITEM FOUND TYPICALLY THE VAST MAJORITY ARE HAPPY BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU THAT I NEVER GET ANYBODY THAT MONEY IN THE POCKET HAPPY OTHER. I'M SORRY HE INDEED. IT'S MONEY IN THE POCKET IS WELL IT'S EXACTLY YEAH NO ABSOLUTELY IT'S. IT'S BEEN A VERY. SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN OUR PORT WE HAD A LESS SUPPORT FROM OUR HARBOR DISTRICT WHICH IS GREAT. YOU KNOW THE PRESS LOVES IT IT'S IT'S A GREAT STORY OF FISHERMEN BEING THE PROACTIVE LEADERS IN WHALE ENTANGLEMENT FIVE REDUCTION EFFORTS. AND THAT'S THE THE P. SAID ALWAYS SAY IS THAT WHEN IT CAME TO THE CRAPPY RETRIEVAL BILL. IT WAS NOT AT. WHO'S NOT A LOBBYIST THAT CAME TO US IT WAS THE CRAFT LEAGUE THAT THE CRAFT LEADS THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE. TO MOVE ON THIS ISSUE. IN A PROACTIVE MANNER WHAT I WHAT I WOULD ADD THAT THAT HAVING THAT LAW AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THE ONE THING MISSING. FROM OUR VOLUNTEER PROGRAM AS SUCCESSFUL AS IT IS IS THE TEETH. WE NEED THE TEETH OF THE DEPARTMENT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TELL THOSE FEW FISHERMEN THAT WANT TO SAY HEY I WANT MY GEAR AND I'M I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FOR IT. BE LIKE. THIS IS THE WAY THE PROGRAM WORKS AND YOU CAN TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT IT THAT'S FINE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT NOW SO WE WE FIND OURSELVES SOMETIMES WORKING IN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE AND A DISADVANTAGE WITHOUT. THAT SUPPORT THINK THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE TIME. WORKS. EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE THEY NEED TO BE A STICK. AND. IT. IN A IN A HAD TO SAY THIS DEADLINE TO FINALLY GET THIS. PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE STATE. HAS BEEN DESPERATELY NEEDED WHEN I FEEL LIKE FROM JUST ONE MORE THING IS I THINK FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN USE IN WORKING THIS PROGRAM OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A STICK. I REALLY THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT STICK WILL NEED TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THE VERY LIMITED BACK IN THE CLOSET WILL BE SMALL YES. THANK YOU AGAIN. NOT EXACTLY YOU HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB IN LEADING THE WAY IN SHOWING WHAT CAN WORK WRITING. IN WHAT YOU HAVE DONE NOW IS TURNED TO LAW. AND IS NOW GOING TO BE SPREAD ACROSS. EACH OF THE POOR TO CALIFORNIA SOMETHING REALLY PART OF THINKING WELL I'M PROUD OF THE FISHERMEN THAT I WORK WITH THAT MAKE THIS HAPPEN. AS JOHN WAS RUSSIA. ALL RIGHT.

SERMON CHOIR AND. MISTER STONE THANKS FOR HANGING IN. ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO TO SERVE A CHOIR AND AND TOM FOR. RECEIVING OUR NOMINATIONS FOR OUR COMMITTEE THOUGHTS WERE TRYING TO GET OUR COMMITTEE HAS FILLED OUT AND WE APPRECIATE YOU. HELPING. PROCESS THOSE FOR US. THE CALIFORNIA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SEVEN IS STILL HEAD HAS BEEN ATTENDING THESE FISH FOR MEETINGS FOR. MANY MANY YEARS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE AND WE'VE HAD THE DUBIOUS ROLE OF REPORTING TO YOU. THE DECLINE OR SALMON AND STEELHEAD POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND. TODAY DON'T HAVE ANY BETTER NEWS THAN THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO OBSERVE THOSE SIMILAR DECLINES. YOU HEARD FROM DOCTOR THIS ALREADY ON CAL TRIALS. STATE OR SALMON REPORT THAT WAS COMPLETED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. HE WOULD IN THE CAR QUITE A QUITE A GOOD DETAIL WE HAVE REPORTS AVAILABLE I THINK THEY'VE BEEN DELIVERED TO YOU AND YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO. YEAH GREAT. ONE MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THOSE SOME. OF THE SUMMARY THAT I HAD YOU KNOW IN MY NOTES HERE IS THAT FIFTEEN OF THE STATE'S THIRTY TWO SEVEN STILL POPULATIONS. ARE EITHER THREATENED ENDANGERED OR EXTINCT. THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD IN THAT REGARD. THE KLAMATH RIVER. SPRING RUN CHINOOK SALMON POPULATION IS NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION BY THE NATURAL FISHERY SERVICE FOR LISTING OF THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT THAT WAS ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY. FOLLOWING THE PETITION THAT WAS SUBMITTED. BACK IN NOVEMBER. AND FINALLY MY NOTES HERE. TO OUR POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE THE COASTAL SHOULDN'T CALL SAM AND. THE CENTRAL COAST CO SALMON POPULATION IN THE WINTER AND STILL AT SEVEN POPULATION ARE BEING SUSTAINED BY. BROODSTOCK PROGRAMS NOW IT'S REALLY THE LAST STAGE BEFORE EXTINCTION AND IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR BROOD STOCK PROGRAM AND A HATCHERY. RAISES ADULTS IN THE HATCHERY IN ORDER TO PRODUCE TO WHAT ELSE TO RELEASE BACK INTO THE WILD SO IT'S. KIND OF A A DIRE SITUATION FOR THOSE POPULATIONS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF THAT. BUT THESE CONDITIONS THAT LET OUR COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER RECOMMENDING TO YOU. THE SAME EMERGENCY AND I SAY WERE CONSIDERING MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION OR NOT SILLY MAKING THAT RECOMMENDATION TODAY WE MET THIS MORNING WE DISCUSSED THAT AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS MIGHT BE. AND WILL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER THAT. BUT THIS KIND OF DECLARATION% WOULD WOULD TO SPEND SOME PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS AND ALLOW SOME OF THE RESTORATION PROJECTS TO PROCEED IN A LITTLE LITTLE MORE STREAMLINED FASHION. AND IT ALSO MIGHT ALLOW THE STATE WATER HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA'S. WATERS RIVERS STREAMS WATERSHEDS. AND THEIR ADDITIONALLY THREATENED BY. CLIMATE CHANGE AND CHANGING RAINFALL PATTERNS SO WEIRD. YOU KNOW WE'RE THE RESILIENCY OF OUR OUR RESOURCES IS REALLY BEING IMPERILED RIGHT NOW. IS BECOMING DIRE. AS YOU KNOW. FOR DECADES THE STATE HAS BEEN INVESTING SIX SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC RESOURCES. RECOVERY EFFORTS FOR SALMON AND STILL AHEAD ON WE HAD PROPOSITION FIFTY PASS IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. PROPOSITION EIGHTY FOUR AND TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HAD THE PROPOSITION ONE WATER BOTTLE TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WE ALSO RECEIVE ON THE ORDER OF TEN TO FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR IN FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE PACIFIC COAST OF SOMEONE A RECOVERY FUND. AND ALL OF THESE IN TOTAL. ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS IT REALLY CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THESE RECOVERY EFFORTS AND YET. WE'RE NOT SEEING THE RESULTS THAT WE WE EXPECT WE SHOULD BE SEEING. SO I'M GONNA JUST PROVIDED. THERE'S ONE MORE THING. BUDGET COMMITTEE WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION AND WE HAVE DONE SO BEFORE THAT THE THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDER INPUT. IN THESE PROGRAMS AND SPECIFICALLY THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE FUNDING PARTIES AND DECISIONS IS REALLY BEING DIMINISHED OVER TIME. THE TRINITY RIVERS. FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS YOU KNOW WAS WAS SEIZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN FOLLOWING THE ELECTION. OF THIS PAST YEAR THAT THE FISHERY GRANT PROGRAM REVIEW COMMITTEE WAS. PREVENTED FROM MEETING BECAUSE OF UNSUBSTANTIATED CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE BY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS. THEN THE ENTIRE. PROPOSITION ONE EXPENDITURES THROUGH THE STATE'S WATER SHOULD BRANCH AND THE. QUALITY CONSERVATION BOARD STRICKLAND HAS BEEN PROGRAMS. HAVE REALLYNO PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OR INPUT ON THE PRIORITIZATION OF THOSE GRAHAM PROGRAMS. DESPITE ITS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S BEING EXTENDED SO. WE REALLY FEEL LIKE OUR. RESTORATION COMMUNITY AND AND PRACTITIONERS NEED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE IN THE OVERSIGHT OF PROGRAMS. SO JUST A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE OUR COMMITTEES TO LIVING YOU TODAY. WE WELCOME THE DEPARTMENT'S RECENT OUT REACH TO RESTORATION LEADERS TO HOST A MEETING JANUARY THIRTY FIRST THIS YEAR. UP TO SEEK OUR INPUT ON HOW BEST DEPARTMENTS SOMEONE A RECOVERY PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS. WE SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET CHANGE PETITION WE HAVEN'T SEEN A RECENT VERSION OF THAT BUT THAT WAS SHOWN TO US. IN JANUARY ON THAT WOULD ADDRESS STRUCTURAL SHORTFALLS IN AN INCREASED STAFF POSITIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON THIS CRISIS AND AND BRING MORE RESOURCES. AND WITHIN THAT WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STAFF POSITION BE PRIORITIZED TOWARD MORE STRATEGIC PLANNING. STREAMLINING OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND EXPANDING THE DEPARTMENT'S CAUSED A MONITORING PROGRAM SO WE CAN TRACK OUR POPULATIONS WERE DOING A POOR JOB OF THAT. WE URGE THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE STEPS THE DEPARTMENT FISH WALLET TO TAKE STEPS TO SECURE THE FUTURE OF THE COASTAL MONITORING PROGRAM. AND IDENTIFY A FUNDING STRATEGY THAT WILL ENSURE THE WORK OF THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM. CAN CONTINUE ON OUR UNINTERRUPTED THERE'S BEEN SOME PROPOSED CHANGES WITH REGARD TO HOW THE. OBSTACLES OF SOMEONE IN RECOVERY FUND. COMES IN TO THE% STATE AND GETS DISTRIBUTED TO THE DEPARTMENT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS AND AND. WE'RE NOT CLEAR ON ON WHAT THOSE CHANGES ARE. SORT OF SEEKING MORE INFORMATION THERE. THEN WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT OUR STATE'S PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES ARE FRESH WATER FISH AND WILDLIFE SPECIES ARE PROTECTED. FROM THE NEWLY FORMING LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY. WITH SOUND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY IN STRONG ENFORCEMENT. WE THINK THAT STATE AGENCIES NEED TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS HOW THEY'RE PERMITTING PROGRAMS. AND ENFORCEMENT APPROACH IS WORKING AND BE READY TO ADAPT AS THEY SEE THAT THEY'RE NOT WORKING AS WELL AS WE NEEDED TO. THE RESTORATION FUNDING FROM TAX REVENUE FROM CANNABIS. NEEDS TARGET THE RESOURCES THAT HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST I THINK THOSE ARE MOSTLY. NORTH COAST IN CENTRAL COAST WATERSHEDS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS AS THEY COME INAND BUILD OVER TIME. ARE DIRECTED TO THE PLACE THAT ARE IMPACTED THE MOST BY THAT ACTIVITY. AND AND WE NEED TO IDENTIFY ACCUMULATIVE LIMIT TO HOW MANY GROWING UP GO OPERATIONS CAN CAN CAN WASH IT SUSTAINED WE DON'T HAVE THAT. THAT CHEMO TO EFFECTS ANALYSIS AND. WE NEED THAT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. AND LASTLY WE WE STRONGLY URGE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ALL IF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND WITH OVERSIGHT FROM YOUR COMMITTEE TO STRENGTHEN YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY OF RESTORATION PRACTITIONERS. SO THAT WE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO AND HELP FIND SOLUTIONS IT'LL. REVERSE THIS TREND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED EXTREMELY THOROUGH I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WILL THAT MIKE. IN AIR AND SPEAK IN THE END I WILL COME BACK TO QUESTIONS COMMENTS THAT WORKS FOR FOLKS. RICHARD OVER TO MIKE WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE CAPTAIN SIMMS HIM COMMITTEE CERTAINLY WELCOME YOU IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU QUICK TO TALK WITH YOU LAST NIGHT AS WELL. WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MY NAME IS MIKE CRICKETS? THE. CALIFORNIA SALMON STAMP COMMITTEE. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. ALL FOR THE HELP WITH THE REST A RE AUTHORIZATION SO THEY WERE IN BUSINESS FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS AGO SO. THAT'S GREAT SO THAT WE CAN KEEP WORKING. FOR OTHER COMMITTEE IS. LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERS WERE DOWN THAT NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE FISHING AND SO THE THE THE MONEY MONEY WE HAVE TO SPEND IT IS A LOT SMALLER THAN WHAT IT WAS BUT WE WOULD. LIKE TO STAY AND RESTORATION. AND THAT TRAINING AND SOME OF THE THINGS WITH THE NET TRAINING WE'RE TRYING TO. PROBABLY HAVE THREE AND A HALF MILLION FISH. TWO OF THE ENHANCEMENT FISH THIS YEAR. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT MANY FISH WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROBABLY. A LARGE SUM OF THE NET TURNS A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE MORE. TRAILERS MAYBE TWO MORE TRAILERS. TO CONTINUE WITH WHAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL RECENTLY IS. NOT RELEASING ANY MORE THAN TWO DAYS IN ANY ONE SITE IN SUCCESSION. THAT WAY WE KEEP THE PREDATION DOWN THE FIRST DAY WE'RE GETTING GREAT RETURNS THE SECOND DAY. IT GOES DOWN TO A FAIR AMOUNT IN THE THIRD DAY WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY OF THOSE FISH BECAUSE WERE MARKING THEM SO THAT BILL SMITH IS THE NET WITH THEM A CALL MYSELF. WE WANT TO GET A COUPLE MORE TRAILERS ISSUE IF WE CAN TO HELP GET THE STRETCH. IN A TIMELY MANNER SO WE GET THE BEST SURVIVAL RATE. OF THE. DAY YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WORD WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WITH IT WE DID IN THE PAST AS THE NET. AT THE. SCREENS AND. DIVERSIONS WE BUILT IN THE PAST QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO TUNED TO SCREEN SHOPS ONE IN RED BLUFF IN ONE WAY RICA. AND IN THE RECENT YEARS I HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH ACTIVITY OR HEARD MUCH ABOUT IT DID YOU KNOW WE HAD BACK GOES IN. AND OF IT ALL THE MORE WILLING AND GET QUICK MEANT TO BUILD THE SCREENS TO STOP THE FISH FROM. GETTING INTO THE PONDS AND WHATEVER YOU MAY NOT KNOW CRICKET DEER CREEK IN BUTTE CREEK. WE DID A LOT THERE THAT REALLY HELP TO INTO GETTING SOME OF THE RESTORATION BACK. AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK IN THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES. OR A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE AND CAN BE MORE OR. THE. HELP THE RESOURCE MORE. THAN SPEND A LOT OF MONEY STUDY AND HOW TO NOT TO DO IT TENNIS SO. WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AND. YOU KNOW JUST SOME OF THE THINGS VERY COMMITTED THE. SAN JOAQUIN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONTINUE. AS MUCH. OF I'M OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN FISH LIKE WE SAW ON THE SCREEN AND THE KINGS RIVER THAT WAS A IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN TRIBUTARY OF THE SAN JOAQUIN. THAT YOU KNOW INTO IT BEFORE FINAL PLAT DAM WAS OF. THOSE FISH WHEN THEY'RE LIKE THAT IN. JUST THE DAM ON THE SAN JOAQUIN. KILLED A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND RETURNING FISH. THEY WERE ALL FIXED LIKE THAT WE USED TO SAY THAT THEY TURNED LEFT AND WENT SOUTH OF BIG FISH WITH. THE THOSE ARE THE THINGS IF WE CAN GET. THAT SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM BACK ON TRACK WHERE WE WOULD HAVE. A LOT MORE OPPORTUNITY FOR. BECAUSE THERE IS GOOD SPAWNING AREAS LEFT IN THAT AREA WHERE WE HAVE DAMS TOO CLOSE TO THE. TO THE MAIN STEM. WITHOUT HAVING STEP FISH LADDERS TO GET THOSE FISH UP TO THIS THE MITIGATION WITH APACHES IS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL BY ANY MEANS IS WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH A LONG TIME AGO WITH THE FIRST LETTERS. SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE. TRYING TO DO AND WE'RE PRETTY SURE IT'LL HELP THAT YOU'VE HELPED US WITH IT. MY AP OR THE ONES THAT ARE ON THE GROUND DOING THE WORK SO WE'RE THE ONES YOU NEED TO BE THINKING YOU IN JUST SO GRATEFUL YOU TAKE THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY. HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP PUTTING SEVEN THE. WATER SO. YOU KNOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SEMESTER ENDS WAS FAR. ALRIGHT LET'S TURN IT OVER TO AARON FROM IS A SENIOR SCIENTIST AT OCEANSIDE STRESS WE WELCOME YOU INTO GOOD AS HE CAN THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. CAN'T. AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST IS AN INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT WE ARE NOT A STATE AGENCY. AND THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP TO CALIFORNIA'S FORMALIZED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN RESOURCES TO URGE A FACTOR COURSE THAT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND. OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST IS A BOUNDARY ORGANIZATION BRINGING TOGETHER GOVERNMENT ACADEMICS AND COMMUNITIES USING SCIENCES ARE GATHERING POINT. OCEAN OF PERCENT OF COURSE. WERE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON OUR ACTIVITIES TO THE STATE IN VARIOUS FORMS INCLUDING THIS COMMITTEE HEARING TODAY. WHY AM HERE? UNDER UNDER COURSE SO WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION AND IT'S OUR MISSION TO MOBILIZE THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA MANAGEMENT AND POLICY MEANS. WITH RESPECT TO COSTA NOTIONS. AND WE DO THIS WORK BY PARTNERING REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. ESPECIALLY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE WHILE SCIENTISTS AND STAKE HOLDERS. AND I'M HERE TODAY TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON SOME OF OUR WORK THAT'S PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THIS COMMITTEE. WOULD LIKE TO AT BUT YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. VIEWS AND HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. AT FIRST UP ON THE FOURTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT. FASHION SCIENCE TRUST HAS BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL STAFF AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM. TO DEVELOP A REPORT PROVIDING A SCIENTIFIC BASIS TO ADVANCE THE STATE'S ADAPTATION PLANS FOR CALIFORNIA'S COAST NOTIONS. THIS REPORT IS PART OF THE LARGER CALIFORNIA FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENTS ARE A REALLY IMPORTANT WAY WE THINK AND THAT STATE AND LOCAL LEADERS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IS CURRENTLY AFFECTING US AND WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT IN THE FUTURE. AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT. OF THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE TOPICS SUCH AS FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS SEA LEVEL RISE AND OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HEARD ABOUT ALL THESE TODAY. A PORTLY IT ALSO FOCUSES ON THE IMPACTS OF THESE CHANGES AND STRESSORS ON HUMAN HEALTH COASTAL ECONOMIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES. WITH FOR LOOKING AT SOLUTIONS ORIENTED LANDS FOR ADAPTING TO THE CHANGES WE SEE COMING. THIS REPORT WILL BE RELEASED IN THE FALL AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING IT WITH YOU. ON THE FMP PEER REVIEW FRIENDS WEEK CONTINUED TO BE EXCITED TO PROVIDE A SCIENTIFIC PEER REVIEW OF FM TEASING CALIFORNIANS. UNLESS HE LED AN OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL SCIENCE ADVISORY TEAM REPORT PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON CONDUCTING AN ATOM. VIEWS THAT INFORM THE PEER REVIEW CHAPTER FOR THE DEPARTMENT'S ALANA ALAMAIN MASTER PLAN UPDATE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS REQUESTED AND THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL FUNDED US TO UTILIZE THIS GUIDANCE ON TO UPCOMING IN. VIEWS ON HEARING AND RAT ABALONE AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO BEGINNING WORK ON THESE PRETTY MUCH IMMEDIATELY. LASTLY ON HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS ALTHOUGH THANKFULLY IT'S NOT SOMETHING IN THAT AND WE'RE DEALING WITH IN THIS EXACT MOMENT. IT CONTINUES I THINK TO BE ON ON MIND FOR THE FISHING COMMUNITY FOR ACADEMICS AND FOR CONSUMERS. EXCITED ABOUT AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO HOSTING A WORKSHOP AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT WILL PUT. SOME KEY MEMBERS OF STATE AGENCIES ALL ALONG THE WEST COAST AND MAIN IN THE ROOM WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS NGOS AND FISHERMEN. AND TO PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND START TO FIGURE OUT HOW OUR CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS ESPECIALLY DEMO ACID. CAN INFORM THE STATE'S MONITORING DESIGNED FOR SEAFOOD SAFETY AS WE SEE THESE THESE CHANGES COMING. AND TO CLOSE I JUST LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY I AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING US TO SPEAK TODAY. CALIFORNIA TION SCIENCE TRUST IS REALLY APPRECIATE OF OUR ROLE AND OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE STATE AS YOU TACKLE THESE THESE ISSUES. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A VERY GRATEFUL. SEMESTER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ANY COMMENTS. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. DURING TOOK TALK ABOUT I DO I'M. PRETTY SURE I THINK THERE IS ONGOING CONCERN. BUT THE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE MADE FOR HABITAT RESTORATION. AND IT'S JUST THAT HE HAD SAID IT'S NOT WORKING. I AM PARAPHRASING HERE. WALK ME THROUGH HE SAID THAT IS IT. NOT CONSULTING WITH THOSE FOR YOU FOR EXAMPLE YOUR MEMBERS ARE ON THE GROUND. IS IT NOT GOING INTO THOSE WHO ARE. WASHES THEIR MOST IMPAIRED THAT ARE STILL COLD WATER. TRIPS WALKS THROUGH THAT YEAH AND IF YOU DON'T WANT IT IN MY. BUT JUST TO PUT IN CONTEXT WE WE HAVE PROBABLY THE MOST MONEY WE'VE EVER HAD IN THE RESTORATION OF THE NEED TO COMMENT PROJECTS IN IT YOU KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP AT THE. MEETING WE HAD WITH DOCTOR BONHAM ANOTHER'S. I THINK INDIVIDUALLY WORD WE'RE DOING REALLY GOOD THINGS THE PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING SELECTED AND FUNDED BY THESE FUNDS ARE ARE REALLY NEEDED AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE. BEING IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY AND I THINK INDIVIDUALLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO IMPLEMENTING THEM I THINK WE'RE DOING YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BREADTH OF. RESTORATIONNEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FROM IN OREGON BORDER ALL WAY TO TIJUANA INLAND THE FISHERY GRANT PROGRAM NOW INCLUDES CENTRAL VALLEY. PROJECTS. IT'S A BIG AREA THERE'S A LOT OF NEED. AND SO WE'RE KIND OF SEEING A SCATTERSHOT OF PROJECTS AND. SO ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I THINK THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR. SEPARATE LAYERED ECHO THE SAME CONCERN OR OR OR SENTIMENT WHICH IS THAT WE NEED BETTER STRATEGIC PLANNING. SO WE NEED YOU KNOW STAFF PEOPLE WITHIN AGENCIES OUT FRONT IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW WHERE'D WHERE'D AND WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS WERE GETTING PROJECTS READY. IDENTIFYING GEOGRAPHIES THAT THAT WE CAN INVEST IN THAT OLD THAT'LL HAVE A LONG TERM STABLE BENEFIT. WE TALK ABOUT STRONGHOLDS THAT'S THAT'S ONE CONCEPT THAT WE THINK IS IS IS REALLY A GOOD THING. AND I WOULD SAY. THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE SACRAMENTO FOR EXAMPLE OR THE SAN JOAQUIN. IN THE MAIN STEM IS VERY VERY DIFFICULT TO BE ADMITS CAN'T TAKE BILLIONS RIGHT. IN OUR LINE TO AN INCREASE YOU KNOW AND THE OTHER THING IS WE JUST WHAT I THINK WE STARTED TO SEE SOME SOME RECOVERY ARE WATERSHEDS ARE. ARE PROBABLY HEALTHIER NOW THAN THEY WERE A FEW DECADES AGO BECAUSE OF SOME THE REGULATIONS THE TIMBER INDUSTRY AND SO FORTH AND AND SO ACTUALLY NOW. THAT THE TIMBER INDUSTRY IS IS IT A GOOD PARTNER FOR RESTORATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE LARGE OWNERSHIP OF LAND. AND SO WE'RE SEEING BETTER POPULATION RECOVERY THERE. BUT THEN DROUGHT CANNABIS EX YOU KNOW COME IN TO KIND OF UNDERMINED UNDER CUT THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING. SO WATER IT REALLY IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THE STATE WATER BOARD. AND THE PARTITION WHILE IF WATER BRANCH OR OR INITIATING NEW PROGRAMS TO LOOK STATEWIDE AT SETTING ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS. YOU CAN IMAGINE SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S GONNA BE VERY CHALLENGING WITH ALL THE WATER USERS WE HAVE. AND AND SLOW GOING BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE SUPPORTED WE NEED TO-IDENTIFY. THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE STREAM FLOWS THAT ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCES THAT'S NEVER BEEN DONE YOU KNOW IT'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AMAZING. YEAH IN AT YOU KNOW ACTUALLY RIGHT NOW I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF A CANNABIS IS WELL ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AND I CAN I SPEAK. TO THE NORTH COAST SIDE ANALYSTS PICK FOR THE VICE CHAIR BUT. WHERE WE'VE HAD SOME REAL CONCERN? IS ONLY A CALF WILL HAPPEN. SEE AT. REPORTER FORESTRY ISSUE FOR EXAMPLE THREE ACRE CONVERSION PERMITS RIGHT HIGH THAT. FOLKS ARE CONVERTING TEN ACRES FIFTY ACRES AND THERE I NO FOLLOW UP WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD WITH LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT WOULD EXTEND. THE SESSION LIMITATIONS FROM TWELVE MONTHS TO THIRTY SIX MONTHS OUT SO THAT. COVERED PART IN FORESTRY CAN GO AFTER THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE LEGALLY CLEARED ALL THIS LAND AND THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO SIGNIFICANT SEDIMENT FLOWS IN THE STREETS BECAUSE? TIMBER INDUSTRY REALLY HAS BEEN. MAKING INCREDIBLE STRIDES OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES IN PARTICULAR. BUT NOW IT'S BEEN MADE UP WITH. THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF ROE GROWS. IT UNDER THE MILES OF NEW ROADS YET PAYING FOR DECADES TO CLEAN UP THAT MESS UP YEAH. SO. MORE TO COME ON THAT. ONE WHAT HE'S. WE DIDN'T QUITE A BIT OF WORK ON THEIR NO CREEK WITH A CONSORTIUM WITH OF RANCHERS AND FARMERS. WENT TOGETHER WITH THEM THIS IS SENDING A FREE FLOWING STREAMS WITHIN HAVE A TEST PHONING IT WITH THAT. AND ALL IT TOOK WAS JUST TO GET THE RANCHERS TO TO. IT'S OFF THERE THE HEADWATERS IN THESE CREEKS SO THAT THE CATTLE AND HORSES AND WHATEVER WOULD GET IN AND CAUSE A LOT OF MUD AND SILT. AND STUFF THAT. THEY'RE VERY COST EFFECTIVE. AND IT JUST TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND AND COORDINATION YOU KNOW. THAT FOR I THINK INSTEAD OF MAJOR PROJECTS IT. TAKES MORE MONEY PLANNING AND THEY DIDN'T. GET THE JOB DONE THE FOOD. GET BACK TO SOME OF THAT TYPE WORK UNTIL ACTIVE MEASURES RIGHT OFF OF ME ACTUALLY RIGHT. I THINK MY. YOU DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE ARE SO GRATEFUL. THANK YOU NICE WORK OF ART THANK YOU. THE LATEST IT WE'RE NOW MOVING ON TO OUR. PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION AND WE WELCOME ANYONE IN WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE SO PLEASE COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE RIGHT HERE. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES ALL WE ASK IF YOU DON'T MIND THE STATE YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME INTO PLEASE COME ON FOR THE MIKE AND THANK YOU ALL FOR HANGING WITH US. HEY. HOW YOU DOING SIR? MY GLASSES. WE WELCOME YOU DIRECTOR GAINER. THE SO MUCH TO SAY IN TWO MINUTES OUR FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS. THEM TOLD HER HAD A. A REALLY HELP THE CHINOOK RUNS THIS YEAR. BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND THEN AGAIN IN JANUARY. I'M NOT SURE HOW THE CO SITUATIONS ALONG ABOUT HIM OR IS IT YOUR GOES ON BUT THE SURVEY. CREW SOME MORE CHINOOK IN A SHORTER TIME AND SCHROEDER REACHES IN NEVER HAD BEFORE AND THOSE SERVICE STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY. EXCITING. ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. I USE IS BOUNDED INTO A LITTLE BIT A IT SEEMS THAT THE FISHER LUSTRATION GRANT. PROGRAM IS GOTTEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT DETAILS THAT MAKE IT REALLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER PROJECTS. WITH SO MANY LIMITATIONS AND NOT HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY. TO USE FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT PIECES OF EQUIPMENT INSTEAD OF JUST BEING ABLE TO USE THIS PART FOR THAT IN THIS MUCH FOR THAT. AND ALSO. IN NORTHERN MEN TO SEE NO. SOUTHERN HUMBLED TO OTHERS A PARTNERSHIP WITH A LOST CAUSE FOR US TO REFUSE ALL REDWOOD FOREST. AND THERE IS PLANNING A THERE'S A CO RECOVERY PLAN BOTH EVIL RICHARD DELIVER TRIBUTARIES AND. AND FOR YOU SAW NOT THE LOST COAST FORESTED OR NEIGHBOR. OF A LOT OF GOOD PROJECTS A LOT OF GOOD WORK HAS BEEN DONE BY THE OTHER HAND THERE'S BEEN. SOME PROJECTS I KNOW THERE'S A LOST CAUSE FOR US PUT IN THAT WAS MULTI BENEFITS I INCLUDING THE STREAMS ROADIE COMMISSIONINGS AND ROAD UPGRADES FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE LAND. WON THE FACTORS NEED TO BE TAKEN THE PLACE AND. IS TO ENCOURAGE THE RESTORATION RELATED ECONOMY OF THESE AREAS PEOPLE THAT HAVE DEVELOPED THE SKILLS AND AND AND THESE ARE THE FUTURE AREAS TWO. OF THE SOUTH FORK EEL COURSES EVERY FUTURE AND. COME OVER WHEN I FED STREAM IT JUST A. THAT MAN IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS ALSO I THINK IS IMPORTANT HERE AND. CARBON SEQUESTRATION RULE COMPREHENSIVE. THING AND THEN THEN AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD PRESS. NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AND POLICY CHANGES YEAH. VERY GOOD BUT. BECAUSE. AND THE SECOND CODE IS EASY AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS THAT SEEMTO REAL BIG PROBLEMS WITH CANVAS. BUT A LOT OF THE THINGS ARE GOING OUT AND ENCOURAGES A BIGGER PEOPLE HAVING HEAVIER IMPACT BECAUSE OF THE MONEY THAT THEY NEED TO PUT IN TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE IN THE SOUL. AGRARIAN CULTURE GOES BACK HUNDREDS OF YEARS REALLY. BUT. THE SMALL. FARMER IN MULTI. WAYS OF EARNING A LIVING IN RURAL AREA AND SAYS IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO GET THE MAXIMUM CHANGE IF PEOPLE DO WANT TO FISHERIES IN THE RUSSIANS. OUT OF ITS. EDUCATION OF THE WHOLE POPULATION I JUST A SECOND NICELY IN WHICH MAKES A GREAT POINT WE JUST HAD A. A LARGE HEARING OVER THREE HUNDRED TURNED OUT. AND YOU CAN I. A WEEK AGO TODAY. IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES IN REGARDS TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT ALL THE NEW WATER RULES IN ALL THE LAND USE RULES IS. THAT THE COST OF PERMITTING IN THAT'S A AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR HIS YOU ACTUALLY WRITE PARTICULAR SMALL FAMILY FARMERS WE WELCOME YOU SIR AND THANK YOU SO MUCH IT TO ME. HI I'M MINDING IT MIKE MITCHELL A. CALIFORNIA DOLLAR FISHMAN US CENSUS CO DRAGGER DOESN'T MAKE US. TWO THINGS THANKS TO MIKE FOR THAT DISASTER BILL. AND LONG TIME SAYS THAT THAT AFTERNOON AT THE SCHOOL WAS IN A RANGE THAT YOU SPOKE. OF GOD WHAT HAS WORKED BETTER FOR THAT FINGERING WEIGHT WITH THE HOW THAT BILL I THANK YOU FOR THAT THERE TOO MEANS A LOT TO ME. BECAUSE I'M WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSFER MY PERMIT NOW IT OUGHT TO BE DEAD. FOR. THE. GET OUT COMMERCIAL FISHING. A FEW OTHER THINGS BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT I WANT TO POLICE TO PUSH ON NASA. VESSEL. FOR THE LENGTH OF THE SAME SIZE OR FOR LESSER CAPABILITY. I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT LEAVE THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE. BECAUSE. I ALSO WORKED A LOT OF THEM BY MELLISA WE WANT TO KEEP THIS A FRIDGE WE FISHERY TO WAGES AND NOW. THE FLOORS. HOW BIG THE BOATS ARE? AND THEY WERE THE THERE'S A LOOPHOLE THAT WE FOUND OUT WHAT WITH CRAP TRANSFERS THERE WAS. WITH BUTCH SPOTS IN THEIR BOATS MAKING BIGGER. AND IT SEEMS LIKE. WE'VE KNOWN EVEN TOUCHED ON AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT. BOTH WOULD. MAKE UP A GUY COULD MAKE THE BULLS BIGGER QUITE A BIT BIGGER TWICE AND WHAT NOT TWICE BUT A THIRD BIGGER OR MORE. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE IT SURVEYED AND THEN THEY SEND THE SURVEY TO. THE COAST GUARD THE COAST GUARD. DOCUMENTS THAT VESSEL AT. TEN FEET LONGER FIFTEEN FEET LONGER WHATEVER THEY SEND THAT DOCUMENTATION FISHING GAME FISHING AND LOOKS AT THAT DOCUMENTATION OKAY THIS VESSEL IS CUT OFF FIFTY FOOT PERMIT ON IT OR WHATEVER WILL IN ESSENCE ME THAT BUT WHEN WE HAD A FORTY FOOT. PERMIT WHEN THEY STARTED BUT THEY MADE IT BIGGER. THAN OUT THAT AUTOMATICALLY JUMPED UP TEN FEET OR FIFTEEN FEET OR EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT AND NOW YOU GOT A BIG BOAT THERE THAN FISHING GAMES OR SO CASES. AND THEY JUST LOOK AT THE PAPERWORK AND THAT'S ALL THEY NEED TO DO. AND. TO ME I WOULD LIKE TO SEE OF OF THAT VESSEL BE A VESSEL OF THE SAME. SIZE OR LESSER CAPABILITY THAT THAT BEAUTIFUL PERSON ONCE A BIT MAKE THAT BOTH BIGGER THAT'S FINE BUT WHEN THEY TRANSFER THAT PERMITS GONNA BE. TO A BOAT OF WHEN THEY STARTED WITH THAT PERMIT YOU KNOW IF IT WAS A FORTY FOOT PER MEADOW ALL OF THEM BECAUSE A LOT OF A LOT OF BIG BOATS AND A CRAB SEASON. GRAPHIC THREE NOW THAT THAT WEREN'T THERE BEFORE BECAUSE THEY MADE A BOLD MUCH BIGGER AND THEY GET TO SELL THEIR PERMITS AT THAT SIZE BUT WHATEVER THEY MADE THEIR BOATS. UP THAT LATE THEY MADE THE BALLS INTO SOUL THEY COULD GAIN FOR TEN FIFTEEN FEET ON THEIR PERMITS AND THAT'S A PERMIT THAT THEY SELL. PERMIT THAT THEY STARTED WITH ACTUALLY I I HAVE. A WHOLE LIST OF FOLLOW UPS AND KEEPING AN EYE JUST I WROTE THAT DOWN TO WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON THIS THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU OKAY AFTER I WAS TOLD THAT FISHMAN A VERY CREATIVE. AND. A VERY CREATIVE MAYBE TOO MUCH CREATE A. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. BACKED ENOUGH THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SIR HAVE YOU BEEN DOING. WORKING ALL RIGHT BUT JUST A QUICK ONE ON THAT ONE THEM TYPICAL I'M A FISHERMAN FROM A HALF MILLION BY. WAY MORE IT MADE. YOUR DAY IN SHIPS WE WANT TO KEEP UP WITH THOSE WILD STUFF. RIGHT DOWN. GENERALLY WILL HELP THE NATION NOT BECAUSE YOU CAN SAY. BUT THIS GREEN YELLOW AND RATE. FOLLOWING THE WILDS IN THE BODY CAN WE GO TO MOVE IT FROM THAT SIDE AND THEN THE WILES MOVIES AND THEN WE MOVED FROM THE ON. THAT TO CRACK AND CONFUSION. ALSO TO STOP THE ARGO. A LOT OF THE POINTS. ONE THING I ALWAYS DO IT WILLOW SITTING HERE THIS PROPOSITION ONE. WE PUT NOLA'S MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AND TO RESTORING THE DELTA IT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT WITH BIG GOLD DAME CONNELL. IT'S GOING TO PUMP THE WATER OR WHY. AS IN THIS SORT OF QUITE A LOT OF LIKES TO DO A DAMN MONEY. YEAH. WE GO TO CHECK THE KNOWING OF THE GOD DAMN PROPOSITION ONE. TOWARD A DAY SELLING ALL OF THE ACTION IN CLEANING PLANT. IT'S TAKEN US NOT FOR OUR COME ON HERE TO BE UP TO OR WHAT ON BLABBER KNOWN ABOUT YOU DIDN'T TO HIS. AND FOR THE FAMOUS EVEN UNDER AND FIFTY MILLION BUT I THINK IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CYPRUS. RIGHT. DOOMED WITH HIS LOGIC NAIL. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STOP BRADEN AND GROWN UP MEN'S. YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE SEGMENT FOOTBALL I BOMB AND SNAIL AND THINK IT WORKED A AT IT. YOU WANT TO DO THE MATH. LIST FOR ALL NIGHT OUT BROUGHT SOME OF THAT ONE. THE MOTION PASSES. AND I JUST GOT TERRIBLE AT HEARING YOU WILL LIST THE FIREARMS AGE COMING ON. THE MARKETS HAD STARTED IN CANADA AND DESTROYED WATERS ON A MUSCLE FILED. WITH THE COUNT OF THE MOLLY CASTED COMES FROM. SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANOTHER INDUSTRY STARTED WE WERE UNDER THE SUN SIGN BANNER. SO I GOT BACK TO WHAT LORI FREE SAID WE NEED TO LOOK AT LARGE NUMBERS. YOU KNOW I FOUND OUT WHAT A GIVEN NEAR FULL HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION DISAPPROVE IT BUDDY. THERE ARE. I YEAH I WOULD HAVE REALLY OKAY HEY WATCH OUT I'M NOT GONNA GO. I DO NOT CUT MY LOVE GO EVEN AT THIRTY SECONDS AKA THIRTY SECOND SERMON. WE MORE BABIES JOAN AND SOME WRONG DIRECTION AREA. BEFORE SHAPES TODAY AND WENT TO A WEEK I WORK STING CHIN. NATURE OF THE FORCE YESTERDAY AND. FROM BEING STYLE A JURY BY GRADE THE WIND AROUND SALMON AND STUCK THEM IN NEW ZEALAND. NOW IF YOU CHECK VIA. THE GENETICS BY CHALLENGING. ROAD THAT WILL BRING IT BACK IT'S NOT THE SAME GOD DAMN FISH. YEAH WE GOT A WHOLE DIFFERENT ECOLOGY AN AREA. AND WE STILL CHASING THAT ORIGINAL STAIN FACTOR THESE FIRST TO TRY DOING WELL WITHOUT US IN A RANT RIGHT. BUT CHANGING. FOR A COOL ONE IT WELL. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY THE BOYS FROM WASHINGTON. COME UP WITH IT. RESULT TO WHAT WE SHOULD START LOOKING AT THAT NOW AND I APPRECIATE IN BY THE WAY. WE ALWAYS LOVE IT WHEN YOU'RE HERE PAT AS YOU WERE COMING UP AND YOU WERE FIRED AWAY IT'S THE BEST THAT SOME OF THE BEST TESTIMONY SO DISTRESSING THANK YOU. BUT JUST REAL QUICK ON THE ISSUE OF. THE OTHER ITEM. ALSO AND I KNOW THAT THE DRUG HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE COLOR CODED SYSTEM WHEN IT COMES AWAY ALSO. WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE PROVIDING THAT MOVING FORWARD LEGISLATION THIS YEAR WITHIN THE OMNIBUS BILL TO ALLOW THE DIRECTOR TO HAVE TEMPORARY CLOSURE. CRABBING AREAS DURING CRAB SEASON WHEN WHALES ARE PRESENT TO CURRENTLY THE DIRECTOR DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO TEMPORARY CLOSURE. IN IT WOULD BE BAD SO THAT THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE NEED TO BE ON THE MOVE AND BECOME MORE NIMBLE ON IN THE FLEA IS SUPPORTING THAT. AND I'M WITH YOU ON THE ISSUE OF TUNNELS SO. WHEAT IT SO THAT'S A BIG ONE TO WORK ON THE ASSIGNMENT. YA'LL YEAH THERE IS LITTLE PAULA YEAH SO WE'RE GOING TO GET TO KNOW A BODY GETS A BOX. THE BOYS ALIAS SECOND THE MONEY TO MATCH WHAT WE PUT IN AND. HOLD ON IT GO HEY GOOD TO SEE YOU BEEN BUILT OR PUT IN. THE THE WATERS OFF CALIFORNIA IN RECENT YEARS. AND THAT NEW OFFSHORE OIL WELLS OR SOMETHING THAT'S BEING PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE. ON UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION UNDER OPENING NEW FEDERAL LEASES. IN REALITY ACCORDING TO DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION DATA ANALYZED BY THE FRACTURE CRACKER ALLIANCE. ON STATE OIL AND GAS REGULATORS APPROVED FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT NEW OFFSHORE OIL WELLS IN STATE WATERS UNDER EXISTING LEASES IN LOS ANGELES. INVENTOR A COUNTIES. ALSO. ERROL WATERS OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO HUNDRED AND THREE. SEPARATE FRACKING OPERATIONS. THAT THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED UNDER EXISTING FEDERAL LEASES. AND THAT'S BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY THREE IN TWO. THOUSAND THIRTEEN. AND THIS INFORMATION WAS REVEALED. BY A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST BY THE SO SHADED PRESS BACK THAT DAY WAS EXPOSED BACK IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. SHOW ONE THING I'D LIKE TO GET ACROSS TO EVERYBODY HERE TODAY. IS THAT NEW OFFSHORE OIL WELLS ARE ALREADY DONE FACT IN CALIFORNIA THEY BEEN. RB DONE FAQ FOR MANY YEARS. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE PASS LEGISLATION. DRESS SCENE STOPPING NEW. DRILLING FACILITIES AND THAT'S SP EIGHT THREE FOUR N. A. B. WHAT IS IT SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. BUT THOSE THOSE. BAND NEW PIPELINES. AND PEERS IN WARS THAT WOULD GO TO STATE WATERS RACE WOULD I THINK APPLY TO BOTH THE STATE BORDERS AND TO THE FEDERAL WATERS. WHERE'S THE INFRACTION ANDERSEN WASH OR OILS WELLS BEING IMPLEMENTED. CAN'T THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I'M GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE YOU'RE HERE EVERY YEAR AND IT'S GREAT TO SEE LAST NIGHT AS WELL. HEY GUYS WERE ALMOST SET WERE A GOOD EVENING. SELL ADS IN THE PAPER HANGING WITH THE ENTIRE TIMES GOOD TO SEE YOU. HIGH. ALEXIS JACKSON AT THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. I WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE ENDS WILL TAKE YOUR TIME JUST SITTING IN THE NATURE CONSERVANCY BEEN WONDERFUL PARTNER. ON ALL ISSUES HERE RELATED TO WELLS ENTANGLEMENTS JUST WANNA PLEASE PASS OUR SINCERE THANKS THANK YOU HAVE FOR THEM. JUST WANNA TAKE KNOWLEDGE THAT COMMENTS IN THE TESTIMONIES TODAY I I THINK THERE'S A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT. CLIMATE DRIVEN CHANGES ARE IMPACTING OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEMS AND THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SUPPORT. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THESE CHANGING OKAY OCEAN CONDITIONS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT WE START TO BUILD INNOVATIVE AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALLOW US TO MORE FREQUENTLY. AT COLLECT INFORMATION TO MARTY'S RESOURCES ALLOWS TO COLLECT HIGHER QUALITY DATA AND ALSO THAT WE'RE EXPLORING MORE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKS. AND LISA DAMROSCH. HIGHLIGHTED OF REALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISM THAT EXISTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH IS THE EXEMPTED FISHING PERMIT PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SORT OF ON THE WATER EXPERIMENTATION THAT REALLY NEEDED. TO EXPLORE THESE NEW INNOVATIONS. EXCEPT WE STILL DON'T HAVE THIS PROGRAM AT THE STATE LEVEL FROM AND SO THE CONSERVANCY DOES REMAIN ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT IS ALL DAY TODAY WERE REALLY GRATEFUL AND THEN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE ALL DAY AS WELL HAVE. MY NAME IS JEFF CHESTER I'M FROM MONTEREY CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR FOR AND SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR OCEANIC WHICH IS AN INTERNATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. OUR MOTTO IS SAVE THE OCEANS AND FEED THE WORLD. THANK YOU JIM ACQUIRE AND A PEN AND VICE CHAIR STONE FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP TO PROTECT OUR COASTLINE FROM OIL DRILLING PROTECT WILDLIFE IN COASTAL BUSINESSES AND SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES. BUT IT'S GREAT ALSO TO JOIN FORCES WITH CALIFORNIA FISHERMEN TO OPPOSE OIL DRILLING AND AND PARTICULARLY PC FFA WHICH OF COURSE WOULD BE A DEVASTATING TO OUR FISHERIES WILDLIFE AND AND. AN ECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THE OMNIBUS FISHERIES BILL ARE THIS YEAR. ON THE ISSUE WILL INTEGUMENT SO SHE AND ANOTHER GROUPS BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO THE STATE'S ATTENTION THREE YEARS AGO IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN A MEMBER OF THE DUNGEONS CRAB FISHING YOU'RE WORKING GROUP. FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WHICH I BELIEVE. DESPITE A FEW TOUGH MOMENTS HAS ACTUALLY MADE GREAT STRIDES TOWARDS. AND DEVELOP NEW TOOLS AND A AND A CONFERENCE A FRAMEWORK FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE TESTING THE THIS WHOLE RAMP UP PROGRAM WITH THE REGULAR GREEN. THEY WERE MAKING EXCITING PROGRESS WERE ALSO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS WELL CAN GROUP IN BEING AN ADVISORY BODY TO THE DIRECTOR THERE. AND WE DO WE DO ASK ALSO THAT YOU DO INCLUDE. THE THE SEA TURTLES OR IF IT'S PHYSICALLY LEATHERBACK SEA TURTLE WHICH IS THE THE MOST IMPERILED ENDANGERED SPECIES ENTANGLED IN CRAB GEAR. IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S ALSO THE STATE RUNNER UP TELL OF CALIFORNIA SO WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THAT SPECIES AS WELL. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH A CRAB TRAP AND THEN THE WORKING GROUP TO WORK TOWARD SOLUTIONS THERE. AND ALSO SUPPORT THE GEAR MARKING PROVISIONS JUST BRIEFLY ON THE EDGE OF THE PROVISIONS. WE SUPPORT A SMALL SCALE TO STABLE FISHERY THERE. WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS IN THE COURT TO CONTINUE. DISCUSSION TO ENSURE ONGOING SUSTAINABILITY. AND AND A ON THE ISSUE OF THE THE THE SWORD FISH IN THE DRIFT GILL AT ISSUE WE DO REMAIN DEEPLY TROUBLED. BY THE BY CATCH CONTINUING ENOUGH. FEDERAL FISHERIES. THIS IT DOES CUT DEPARTMENT LED EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT MONITORING HARD CAP SOME BI CATCH AND BUY OUTS BUT ALL THOSE EFFORTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY STALLED. AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM AND WE LIKE TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT WITH THAT. AND THEN LASTLY. THE SENTIMENT WHERE YOU'VE BEEN YOU'VE BEEN ASKING A LOT ABOUT THAT STARTING ISSUE WE'VE BEEN HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THAT A HISTORY THAT I WANTED TO OFFER JUST THE PERSPECTIVE THAT. DURING A NINETY SEVEN PERCENT DECLINE. OF OVER FISHING ON TOP OF A NATURAL DECLINE IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER WE WIN THEN CANNERY ROW. IT HAPPEN AGAIN WE STILL YET TO SEE THE MANAGEMENT REFORMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO PREVENT SOMEWHERE THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. SO ANYWAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALL YOUR ALL YOUR GREAT WORK AND. AND AND AND AS FOR BEING A LEADER ON OIL DRILLING AND IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO OUR MEMBERSHIP WHICH WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND. AND EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT EATING GOOD SEAFOOD THAT'S FROM FROM OUR LOCAL WATER SLIPPING ALL OVER JEFF'S NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY. PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. HEY GOOD AFTERNOON COKE PROFESSIONAL SEAFOOD HARVESTS FOR AN AREA OF WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WE TALKED ABOUT OPEN OCEAN OFF THE PORCH. WHO TALKED ABOUT AND IT'S INTERESTING THEY TALKING MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE GOING TO MAKE? FULL YOU HAVEN'T. GIVEN ONE FOUGHT YET THEY TOLD US SPECIALLY. TO THE SMALL BOWL. OF FISHERMEN THAT FISH ALONG THE COAST FROM WALL SAY FROM THE SHORE OUT TO TWO BALLS OF SAY TEN MILES. EFFICIENT RENEWABLE SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES A SUPPLY OUR LOCAL FISH MARKETS. THEY SERVE FOR THE PUBLIC. AND WHAT THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING AS A COMMENT ON WHAT THESE PIE IN THE SKY IDEAS WERE FACING ONE ON THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL RIGHT NOW. OF TWO THOUSAND ACRES AND THEY WANT TO PUT A RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR BEST HOW ABOUT TROLL GIRLS. WITHOUT ASKING US FIRST. AND NOW WE'VE SAID NO WHAT. WE CAN'T PUT A TERRIBLE WILL BE OUT OF BUSINESS WILL PULL WE'D NOT AGAINST THE. OPEN OCEAN ALL CULTURE BUT HERE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES. AND THEY BOTH TOLD ME THAT HERE'S THE PROBLEM WE SPOKE YOU SUPPORT THIS OPEN OCEAN OFF OF CULTURE BUT WHERE ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT THAT IS NOT GONNA. JUST PLACE ORIGINAL FISHERMEN THAT ARE ALREADY FISHING. AND THERE'S NOTHING IN ANY OF THE PERMIT PROCESS THAT SAYS. THAT BEFORE A PERMIT CAN BE ISSUED THEY SHOULD TALK TO THE LOCAL FISHERMEN IN THAT AREA AND GET THEIR APPROVAL OF WHERE. IT'S GOING TO BE BECAUSE THEY'D ILLYANA WORSE. YOU CAN'T COME JUST DISPLAY A CERTAIN. ERA SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S POSSIBLE TO DO IT WOULD BE A GOOD STEP IN THE FUTURE. TO HAVE IT IN THE PERMIT PROCESS THEY GO THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PERMITS. AND THEIR THEIR PR PEOPLE ARE EXPERTS IN CONNING THE COASTAL COMMISSION WHEN THEIR OWN BIOLOGIST SAYS DON'T PUT IT OFF ALONG THE BEACH IN THIS AREA. KISSER ADD THAT GOT UP THERE. AND SO I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN IN OUR AREA AND I'M GOING TO. DO EVERYTHING I CAN I UNDERSTAND THAT.

GOOD EVENING THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US. VIVIEN HELLO WILL PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS THAT IS I WORK FOR THAT GROUP AND SALMON HABITAT POLICY WORK. AND SOME OF THE THINGS I SAY TODAY MIGHT BE INDIVIDUAL OPINIONS AND NOT NECESSARILY OF THE GROUP. WE WELCOME. BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ONE OF THE CRITERIA FOR OUR NEW GUYS YOU KNOW WHO HAD DISASTERS IN CRAB. IF THEY ARE PERMITTED THEY BOUGHT HAD CATCH HISTORY THAT MIGHT HELP. DONNA. WASHINGTON STATE IS PHASING OUT. OCEAN PEN RAISING OF ATLANTIC SALMON THEY HAD A BIG. DISASTER UP THERE APPEND BROKE RELEASING. A LARGE NUMBER OF ATLANTIC SALMON WHICH COMPETE WITH THEIR NATIVE SALMON RUNS. AND ALSO HAD A VIRUS. SO THEY'RE PHASING OUT WE'VE OPPOSED OCEAN PEN RAISING OF SALMON. IN CALIFORNIA ALL ALONG. THE. FAR NORTH COAST RIVERS ARE ALL SENTIMENT IMPAIRED. OUR RUNS OR NOT RECOVERING ROBUSTLY THEY'RE HANGING ON. AND DECLINING. OVERALL FOR SALMON. THE TIMBER WENT DOWN WITH THE FISHERIES. NOW SEE WE HELPED WRITE THE WORDING IN THE FOREST PRACTICES ACT FOR MAINTAINING QUALITY FOREST PRODUCTS. WE DON'T HAVE A THIRTY TWO INCH SAW LOGS NOW ALL THOSE MILLS ARE CLOSED WE HAVE QUALITY FORCE PRODUCTS MOUNTAINS OF WOODCHIPS GOING TO JAPAN. THE IRONY IS HALF THE YEAR THEY CAN'T GET OUT THE HOME WILL BE ENTRANCE BECAUSE OF THE MUD RIGHT. TO WE HAVE DREDGING IT EVERY YEAR THE MARINAS ARE MUDDIED IN. WHICH. WE HAVE A MODEL. THE COAST GUARD BOAT HAD TO MOVE TO ANOTHER SLIPPED. ALONG WITH THE FISHING BOATS IN THE MARINA BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THE PERMITS YET TO DREDGE THE MARINA. CAUSNG SAFETY HAZARD IN THE CHANNEL. SO CUMULATIVE IMPACTS ARE COMPOUNDING IMPACTS. FOR SAM AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS TO HAVE THE RESILIENCY TO RESPOND TO THESE. COMBINING INSULTS. TO THEIR SURVIVAL. AND SO. DATE ON. YOU DON'T NEED THAT HELP. TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS FROM CERTAIN INDUSTRIES OR CANVAS OR WHATEVER BUT IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME DIRECTORS JUST PILED UP. ON THEM GIVEN THIRTY CAN'T RESPOND EASILY. SO THE STOCK NOW FALL RUN AND WIN AROUND WE WORKED SO HARD TO BRING THAT WENT AROUND BACK FROM THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION. ONLY TO HAVE NINETY PERCENT NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE RUN KILL TWO YEARS IN A ROW AND EVERY TIME I HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEIR SPEAKING IN PASSIVE VOICE. LIKE THIS JUST HAPPENED IT JUST HAPPENED TWO YEARS IN A ROW NO. THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY I DON'T SEE ANYBODY IN JAIL FOR KILLING THOSE TWO RUNS TWO YEARS IN A ROW. AND YET WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LIKE BOTHER HIM AT ALL. WHEN YOU STRING GAUGES MONEY FOR STRING GAUGES WE NEED MINIMUM FLOWS. FOR THE RIVERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FISHERIES ARE CONSERVATIVELY MANAGED ON BEING TRYING TO TALK FAST. THE CONSERVATIVELY MANAGED. SO THIS THIS USE OF THE WORD OVER FINISHED TO REFER TO ANY STOCK THAT'S DEPLETED. IS SERIOUS BECAUSE IT GIVES THE PUBLIC THE WRONG IMPRESSION IF YOU LOOK AT THE NO A FISHERY REPORTS TO CONGRESS EVERY YEAR THERE'S NO OVER FISHING. OCCURRING ON OUR STOCKS ON THE WEST COAST EXCEPT FOR TWO STOCKS THERE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS. LAST I LOOKED WHICH WAS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO RIGHT GOODNESS SO HAVE YOU. IF YOU DON'T MIND OFFER SOME CONCLUDING REMARKS YES MY CONCLUDING REMARKS IS IT THAT I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN. TOM WAS GOING TO BE A STILL HAD FISHERMEN NOT A CRAB FISHERMEN.
