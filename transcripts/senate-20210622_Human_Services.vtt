NOT. BE CONSIDERED A RED. THE

00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:02.447
REASON THAT SHE CAME TO THE

REPRESENTS AND WHAT IT

01:14:50.152 --> 01:14:52.721
REPRESENTS. IS A HIGHLY

01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:55.357
ESSENTIALLY SORT OF PILOTS TO

01:14:55.424 --> 01:14:57.259
PROVIDE SOME VERY HIGHLY

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.962
TAILORED INDIVIDUALIZED SERVICE

BUT THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:04.500
OFFERING IN HERE THAT THAT

01:15:04.566 --> 01:15:06.435
WE'RE TAKING. DON'T JUST DO THE

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.203
PILOT FOR THE HIGH NEED KIDS

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.740
BUT ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS TO

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:14.509
ENSURE THAT THOSE KIDS ARE NOT.

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.645
GOING TO BE PLACED IN THESE.

01:15:16.712 --> 01:15:19.348
MORE RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS IN

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:19.915
THESE HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:22.618
SETTINGS. WITHOUT A PLACE TO GO

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:24.953
SO THAT WE STEP DOWN AND STEP

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:27.823
AWAY FROM. THESE MUCH MORE

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.292
INTENSE SERVICES BECAUSE WE

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.227
WANT TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:34.429

THAT SERVE THEIR INTEREST THE

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:41.570
BEST BUT SOMETIMES WE NEED TO

01:15:41.637 --> 01:15:43.171

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.706
REALLY WHAT AB EIGHT EIGHT

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.541
AWAIT IS ABOUT IT'S ADDRESSING

01:15:46.608 --> 01:15:47.676
THE PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED WHEN

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:49.811
WE HAD THE DECERTIFY KIDS AND

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:50.679
THE FACT THAT WE SEND KIDS OUT

01:15:50.746 --> 01:15:52.514
OF STATE. AT TIMES WHEN WE

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.349
PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE DOING

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:56.118
THAT BECAUSE THE CLOSER KIDS

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.619
ARE HOME. THE BETTER THEY'RE

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:59.721
GOING TO BE THE MORE. THE

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.956
INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENT AND

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.791
THE THERAPEUTIC SETTING WITH

THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.363
THE MORE THAT THAT CAN HAPPEN.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.465
INTENSELY IF NECESSARY AND THEN

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:13.135
STEP DOWN AND STEP AWAY FROM

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:15.604
THOSE MORE. RESTRICTIVE

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.839
INTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTS INTO

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.908
INDIVIDUALIZED PLACEMENTS INTO

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:23.045
A MORE FAMILY LIKE SETTING. IS

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:23.845
FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THOSE

01:16:23.912 --> 01:16:26.048
CHILDREN. THAT'S WHAT AB EIGHT

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:27.916
WAYS TO IT WERE ALSO TRACKING

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:30.185
LANGUAGE THROUGH BUDGET TRAILER

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.687
AND TALK WITH THE BUDGET

01:16:31.753 --> 01:16:33.655
COMMITTEES AND A LOT OF FOLKS

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.190
TO LOOK AT HOW WE CAN FORM

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:37.359
TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM. TO MAKE

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.095
IT WORK BETTER FOR OUTCOMES FOR

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.331
KIDS THAT WE WERE DOING A LOT

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.166
TAKE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT A

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.068
LOT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:47.869
CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER ASKED US

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:49.137
TO TAKE IN THIS OF THE CONCERNS

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:50.439
THAT THEY'VE BEEN RAISING OVER

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:51.173
THE TIME REALLY ABOUT

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.241
ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENSURING

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:55.477
THAT WE HAVE. THE RIGHT KIND OF

01:16:55.544 --> 01:16:58.347
REPORTING AND FEEDBACK ON THE

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:02.117
SYSTEMS SO THE KIDS ARE NOT

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:03.151
GETTING LOST WITHIN THE SYSTEM.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.654
WE'RE ALSO ADDING A MORATORIUM.

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:07.456
IN THIS BILL ON SENDING KIDS

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:09.124
OUT OF STATE ON IT IT'S A

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.426
MORATORIUM ON. THE DEPARTMENT'S

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.062
ABILITY TO CERTIFY AT THE STATE

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:14.963
PLACEMENTS AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.932
HERE. ARE THERE IS SOMETHING

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:17.833
ACTUALLY THAT THE SENATE HAS

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:19.668
BEEN ASKING US TO DO SENATE

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:21.837
BUDGET HAS BEEN ASKING US TO DO

01:17:21.903 --> 01:17:23.638
WE AGREED TO PUT THAT IN HERE.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:24.840
AND I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:17:24.906 --> 01:17:26.341
WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.343
WHO IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS. IS

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.345
NOT HAPPY WITH A MORATORIUM AND

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:31.646
I THINK THEY WILL ADDRESS THAT

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:34.249
COUNTY SAN EARLY WHEN SHE TALKS

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.250
WILL WILL ADDRESS THAT. I'M

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:36.485
FINE WITH THE MORATORIUM

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:37.552
BECAUSE IT MAKES IT PRETTY

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.221
CLEAR STATEMENT. THAT WE NEED

01:17:39.287 --> 01:17:40.722
TO DEVELOP THIS CAPACITY IN

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:43.325
CALIFORNIA. TO THE BEST EXTENT

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.926
THAT WE CAN. I THINK THE

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.094
COUNTIES ARE APPROPRIATELY

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:48.663
CONCERNED RIGHT NOW. THAT AS WE

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.832
DEVELOP THE PILOT. WHICH IS

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.501
MEANT TO BE. THE REPLACEMENT

01:17:52.567 --> 01:17:53.702
FOR THE OT OF STATE.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:55.170
PLACEMENTS AS WE DEVELOP THAT

01:17:55.237 --> 01:17:57.305
PILOT. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

01:17:57.372 --> 01:18:00.342
WITH THE NEED. TO SERVE THESE

01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:00.876
KIDS WE MIGHT HAVE TO BE

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:02.778
SENDING SOME OF THEM. OUT OF

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:05.213
STATE AND I THINK THAT IS. I

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:06.248
UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN AT THIS

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.250
POINT. BUT I THINK IT'S

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.252
INCUMBENT ON US. TO DO

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:12.020
EVERYTHING WE CAN O KEEP THOSE

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:15.123
KIDS IN STATE. DEVELOP THE

01:18:15.190 --> 01:18:16.691
CAPACITY TO SERVE THEM. AT THE

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:18.593
HIGHEST LEVEL POSSIBLE. WITH

01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.695
APPROPRIATE SERVICES INCLUDING

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.197
THE MENTAL HEALTH PORTION. AND

01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:23.331
I WILL ADMIT THAT THAT MENTAL

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:24.533
HEALTH PORTION WAS WHAT WE

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:25.734
STRUGGLED WITH WITH THE

01:18:25.801 --> 01:18:27.069
CONTINUED CARE REFORM IS

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:28.870
GETTING THAT PIECE PUT IN.

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:30.405
BECAUSE THE NOTION WAS THE

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:32.607
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. WE WERE

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:34.176
INSTEAD OF. PROVIDING MENTAL

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:36.278
HEALTH SERVICES AFTER DIAGNOSIS

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.779
IN DOWN THE ROAD WE WERE TRYING

01:18:37.846 --> 01:18:39.047
TO MAKE SURE THAT WILL PROVIDE

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:40.215
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES UP FRONT

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:41.850
FOR THESE KIDS. BECAUSE EVERY

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:44.753
KID COMING INTO CONTACT. WITH

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:47.055
AN AGENCY OR WITH A PROGRAM

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:49.558
LIKE THIS. IS SUBJECT TO TRAUMA

01:18:49.624 --> 01:18:51.226
AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:52.160
EXPERIENCES IN ALL OF THESE

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.895
THINGS THAT. THAT SHOULD LEAD

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.497
US TO MAKE IT NATURAL THAT WE

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.932

01:18:56.998 --> 01:18:59.134
SERVICES TO THEM. AND YET WE

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.969

01:19:01.036 --> 01:19:02.237
PART AND PARCEL TO THIS TO THE-

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:06.241

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:21.723
IF WE CAN HELP THOSE KIDS IN

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.758

CONSIST WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH

01:38:20.327 --> 01:38:22.129

THAT'S BEEN THE STRUGGLE AND A

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:31.805
LOT OF THIS TIER T. P.'S. WORKS

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:33.073
TAKING SOME OF THE KIDS WITH

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:35.142
HIGH SECURITY. AND THAT'S WHY A

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.044
LOT OF THEM WERE LED TO THE

01:38:37.111 --> 01:38:37.978

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:40.981
SENDING THEM OUT OF STATE

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:42.116
REMEMBER THE OUT OF STATE

01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:33.400
HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S MOVING

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:34.435
THROUGH WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUALLY

01:39:34.501 --> 01:39:36.937
WORKING. ON ON THE DRESSING

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:38.772
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES WITH

01:39:38.839 --> 01:39:40.908
THE CONTAINMENT CARE REFORM. IN

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:42.076
LESS CONTROVERSIAL SETTINGS

01:39:42.142 --> 01:39:44.044
THIS IS A THIS IS A MAJOR STEP

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:46.280
SO YES IT IS INTENDED TO TRY TO

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:47.715
ENSURE THAT WE THAT WE HAVE A

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:48.849
BROADER RANGE OF PLACEMENTS FOR

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:51.218
KIDS. ESPECIALLY ONES THAT HAVE

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.187
BEEN HARDER TO PLACE. AS THEY

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:55.022
WERE IDENTIFIED AND BROUGHT IN

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.423
BROUGHT INTO THE SYSTEM BOTH

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:57.758
DEPENDENCY AND DELINQUENCY MORE

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.093
TRYING TO FIND PLACES. FOR KIDS

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:02.629
TO GO. THAT SERVE THEIR NEEDS

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:04.598
SO THIS IS A MISSING COMPONENT

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:06.133
THIS IS A GAP THAT I THINK WAS

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.968
GOING TO BE SHOWN WITH THE GAPS

01:40:08.035 --> 01:40:09.837
ANALYSIS THAT THAT. DEPARTMENT

01:40:09.903 --> 01:40:11.705
WAS DOING BUT IS LATE IN

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:14.575
PROVIDING- WE'RE JUST.

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.276
TIMELINE'S MOVED UP BECAUSE THE

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:17.578
SITUATION WE FOUND OURSELVES IN

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:18.912
WITH THE DECERTIFICATION SO

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.948
YEAH THIS IS INTENDED. TO HELP

01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.850
WITH THAT BUT AS A COMPLETE

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.485
ANSWER NO WE ARE GOING TO

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:25.919
STRUGGLE WITH IMPLEMENTATION

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.488
CHALLENGES AND CONTINUE TO AND

01:40:27.554 --> 01:40:28.622
THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT A BAD

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.691
THING. BECAUSE ANY SYSTEM IT'S

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.159
LARGER COMPLEXES THIS IF WE'RE

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:34.128
NOT CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT

01:40:34.194 --> 01:40:36.330
TAKING FEEDBACK. LOOKING AT

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:37.331
DATA LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:39.099
TO THOSE KIDS THEN WE'RE GOING

01:40:39.166 --> 01:40:39.733
TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE SAME

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.368
SITUATION OF A REFORM THAT

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.270
NEEDED TO BE REFORMED BECAUSE

01:40:43.337 --> 01:40:44.171
KIDS WILL BE DROPPING TO THE

01:40:44.238 --> 01:40:46.640
CRACK. SO IT WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:40:46.707 --> 01:40:48.175
IT AND THEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:48.809
THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:50.544
THE COMMITTEE. AND TO BUDGET

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:51.478
STAFF AND ALL THESE OTHER

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.714
PLAYERS IS NOT JUST THE PILOT

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:54.548
BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE THE

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:56.183
PILOT. AND THIS IS WHERE THE

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:57.217
YOUTH LAWCENTERIS TALKING

01:40:57.284 --> 01:41:00.120
ABOUT. THAT WHAT THEY WERE

01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:01.422
ALARMED ABOUT. HOPE IT LEASE IT

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:03.257
WHAT WE DO IS THE PILOT. AND

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:04.391
THERE'S NO PLACE TO TAKE THESE

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.793
HIGH ACUITY KIDS AND STEP THEM

01:41:05.859 --> 01:41:07.528
DOWN INTO BETTER PLACEMENTS

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:09.296
THAT ARE SERVING THEIR NEEDS.

01:41:09.363 --> 01:41:11.932
THEN WE HAVE RESTRICTIVE AND WE

01:41:11.999 --> 01:41:13.167
HAVE LESS RESTRICTIVE AND

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:16.603
THERE'S JUST NO BROADER PLAN.

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:17.204
SO THAT'S WHY THIS HAS BECOME

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:19.473
COMPLEX. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:22.142
COMPLEX OTHERWISE WE'RE NOT

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:22.709
GOING TO BE SERVING ALL THE

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:26.413
KIDS. SO WHAT BABY MORE LOOKING

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.382
FOR IN THAT BUT YEAH THIS IS

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:30.050
NOT AN EASY THING BUT WE HAVE

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:32.486
SUCH AN OPPORTUNITY NOW HERE TO

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:34.588
CLOSE SOME OF THESE GAPS. AND A

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.190
LOOK AT KIDS AT THE HIGHER AND

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:37.958
GET THEM THE SERVICES THEY NEED

01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:38.425
AND WHAT THE IMPORTANT

01:41:38.492 --> 01:41:41.495
COMPONENT OF THIS IS. IS IF

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:42.062
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THAT

01:41:42.129 --> 01:41:45.766
HIGH. ACUITY SERVICE LEVEL.

01:41:45.833 --> 01:41:47.301
THAT WITHIN STEPPING THEM DOWN

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:49.603
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE

01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:51.338
THAT MEANS THAT THEY'RE-

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:52.439
ADDRESSING WHATEVER IT IS THEY

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:53.807
NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WE'RE

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:55.509
KEEPING THEM OUT OF THE MOST

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:56.977
RESTRICTIVE AND THE MOST

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:59.246
INTENSIVE SITUATIONS WHICH IN

01:41:59.313 --> 01:42:00.881
WHICH IS GOOD FOR THEM TO START

01:42:00.948 --> 01:42:02.316
OFF WITH THE HELP BUT NOT GOOD

01:42:02.382 --> 01:42:04.585
FOR THEM LONG TERM. THANK YOU

BUT- FRANKLY I'M NOT SURE ANY

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:36.316
OTHER STATE DOES IT ANY BETTER

01:42:36.383 --> 01:42:38.418

IT'S A PILOT FOR A COUPLE

01:45:38.598 --> 01:45:40.934
REASONS. ONE OF WHICH SAID THIS

REASONS THAT THE PILOT IS

01:45:48.875 --> 01:45:51.044
PILOTS NOT PERMITTED SETTING

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:53.046
THE OTHER REASONS PILOT. IS TO

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.181
ENSURE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:45:54.247 --> 01:45:56.349
RECOGNIZE. THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:58.385
NEED TO FEED. THE NEED TO BE

01:45:58.452 --> 01:46:00.153
TESTING AND ENSURING THAT WHAT

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.355
WE'RE DOING. WORKS BECAUSE WE

01:46:02.422 --> 01:46:04.091
JUST SET SOMETHING UP AND SAY

01:46:04.157 --> 01:46:06.093
WE'RE DONE RIGHT THERE'S NO.

01:46:06.159 --> 01:46:06.760
THERE'S NONE OF THAT

01:46:06.827 --> 01:46:08.762
ACCOUNTABILITY THERE'S NONE OF

01:46:08.829 --> 01:46:10.897
THAT MAKING SURE WE DID THE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:14.067
RIGHT THING. AND IF THIS IS

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.936
GOING TO MORPH OVER TIME I

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:16.770
THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING IN

01:46:16.837 --> 01:46:18.004
THIS CASE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:19.439
WE'RE LISTENING TO OURSELVES

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:20.006
AND WE'RE LOOKING WHAT THE

01:46:20.073 --> 01:46:21.374
OUTCOMES ARE. GREAT SO THAT'S

01:46:21.441 --> 01:46:24.044
KIND OF WHY. WE TALKED ABOUT IT

01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:27.180
IT IT SORT OF SEEMS A PILOT BUT

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:27.748
IT IS THIS WORKS YEAH WE'RE

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:31.184
LOOKING AT. INTENSIVE SERVICES

01:46:31.251 --> 01:46:32.486
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:33.954
CAPACITY WE DID JUST SEND THEM

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.656
OUT AND BECAUSE WE JUST WE

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.325
WEREN'T ABLE TO SERVE THEM HERE

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:39.493
WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WILLINGNESS

01:46:39.559 --> 01:46:40.894
AND A LOT OF THOSE OTHER

01:46:40.961 --> 01:46:41.728
COMPONENTS WORK MORE QUITE

01:46:41.795 --> 01:46:43.363
WORKING THAT'S REALLY WHAT

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:45.999
WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THERE WERE

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:47.501
NOT ABOUT THAT MANY KIDS THAT

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.236
NEED THAT HELLO HIGH LEVELS OF

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:51.037
SERVICES AND ONE OF MY FEARS.

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:53.073
IS THAT IF WE CREATE. THESE

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:54.674
BETS THE- THERE ARE HIGH LEVEL

01:46:54.741 --> 01:46:57.043
BEDS THAT ARE EXPENSIVE. THEN

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:58.211
WE CREATE THE DESIRE TO

01:46:58.278 --> 01:46:59.379
CONTINUE TO FILL THEM ALL THE

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:01.314
TIME. WELL THAT'S OVER KILLING

01:47:01.381 --> 01:47:03.717
WE'RE PUTTING KIDS IN

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:04.351
SITUATIONS THEY DON'T NEED THAT

01:47:04.417 --> 01:47:05.352
IS NOT GOOD FOR THEM. IF WE SET

01:47:05.418 --> 01:47:07.020
IT UP WITH THE STEP DOWNS IN

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:09.389
THIS CONCERT REVIEW. THEN THE

01:47:09.456 --> 01:47:10.690
SYSTEM IS REALLY SET UP TO TEN

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:12.325
NOT NECESSARILY FILL THOSE BEDS

01:47:12.392 --> 01:47:13.293
BUT MAKE SURE WERE.

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.195
APPROPRIATELY PLACING KIDS SO

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.463
THOSE KIDS WHO NEED LONGER

01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.665
SERVICES. CAN GET THEM. AND THE

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:21.101
KIDS WHO DONALD PARTS STOCK IN

01:47:21.168 --> 01:47:23.436
THAT. THEN THE FLIP SIDE TO

01:47:23.503 --> 01:47:25.205
THIS AND WHERE THE- THE WILL

01:47:25.272 --> 01:47:26.907
FOR DIRECTORS IN THE- PROBATION

01:47:26.973 --> 01:47:29.276
SHE'S ARE CORRECT. WE BROUGHT

01:47:29.342 --> 01:47:30.010
THOSE KIDS BACK AND THEY GOT

01:47:30.076 --> 01:47:31.812
PLACE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:33.446
ACTUAL DISTANCE STATISTICS THE

01:47:33.513 --> 01:47:34.781
NUMBER OF KIDS WHO ARE A WALL

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:36.216
AT WAR WHO WENT BACK INTO

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:38.685
JUVENILE HALL. THAT LEVEL OF

01:47:38.752 --> 01:47:41.988
THE PERCENTAGES OF THOSE KIDS

01:47:42.055 --> 01:47:43.456
WE BROUGHT BACK. NOT ACCEPTABLE.

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:46.059
SO WE HAVE TO AND WHETHER

01:47:46.126 --> 01:47:47.294
REASONS THAT THAT I'M

01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.062
SUPPORTIVE OF A MORATORIUM.

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:51.198
ALTHOUGH I AM SENSITIVE TO MY

01:47:51.264 --> 01:47:53.066
SPONSORS BELIEVE YOU ME ON THIS.

01:47:53.133 --> 01:47:54.801
BUT WE HAVE TO LIGHT A FIRE AND

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:57.103
WE HAVE TO PUSH HARD TO MAKE

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:59.105
SURE WE GET THIS WORK DONE. WE

01:47:59.172 --> 01:48:00.740
HAVE MONEY NOW IN THE STATE WE

01:48:00.807 --> 01:48:02.309
HAVE THE MOMENTUM IN SOME

01:48:02.375 --> 01:48:04.344
IMPETUS. LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE

01:48:04.411 --> 01:48:06.646
OF THAT AND IF ALL WE DO IS

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.548
KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.

01:48:08.615 --> 01:48:11.017
AND THEN ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:48:11.084 --> 01:48:12.419
DO MORE CERTIFICATIONS OF OUT

01:48:12.485 --> 01:48:13.453
OF STATE FACILITIES WHERE WE

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.522
DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL WE DON'T

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:16.156
HAVE THE INSIGHT WE DON'T HAVE

01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:17.958
THE OVERSIGHT. WE'RE GONNA END

01:48:18.024 --> 01:48:19.926
UP BACK WITH THE SAME SCANDALS

01:48:19.993 --> 01:48:21.027
SO LET'S TRY THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:48:21.094 --> 01:48:22.596
HARDER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:24.097
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MEET

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:25.765
THE NEEDS OF THOSE KIDS AND

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:27.467
FROM A PEDIATRICIAN STANDPOINT.

01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:28.468
WHEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:29.502
EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF

01:48:29.569 --> 01:48:30.437
DEVELOPMENT DELAYS AND

01:48:30.503 --> 01:48:32.405
CHALLENGES FOR KIDS. A LOT OF

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:34.140
PHYSICIANS PUSH BACK AND THEIR

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:35.976
PUSH BACK IS WE IDENTIFIED I

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:38.445
DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO REFER

01:48:38.511 --> 01:48:39.579
THEM WE DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES.

01:48:39.646 --> 01:48:40.981
SO IF WE HAVE THE SERVICES IF

01:48:41.047 --> 01:48:43.617
WE BUILD THIS. IN WE CAN HELP

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:45.652
THOSE KIDS. AND WE NO LONGER

01:48:45.719 --> 01:48:47.187
HAVE TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY SO

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:49.289
LET'S JUST DO THAT. I'M WORKING

01:48:49.356 --> 01:48:50.290
FOR THE WITH THIS POPULATION

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:51.291
SPECIFICALLY DEPENDENCY

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:53.860
DELINQUENCY KIDS YES. BUT

01:48:53.927 --> 01:48:55.262
THEY'RE ALSO A LOT OF.

01:48:55.328 --> 01:48:56.830
DEVELOPMENT DISABLED KIDS AND

01:48:56.897 --> 01:48:59.065
OTHERS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW

01:48:59.132 --> 01:48:59.666
REALLY WHERE TO GO THEY GO OUT

01:48:59.733 --> 01:49:02.269
OF STATE. LET'S LOOK AT WHAT

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:04.337
WE'RE DOING HERE. TAKE A HARD

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:06.573
LOOK AT THE SYSTEM. FOR

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:08.541
CALIFORNIA FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:10.277
BURKE VERY LARGE STATE I DON'T

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:12.045
HAVE THE CAPACITY WE SHOULD BE

01:49:12.112 --> 01:49:13.847
DOING ALL OF THAT HERE AND THIS

01:49:13.914 --> 01:49:15.849
IS A STEP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:49:15.916 --> 01:49:16.750
TAKE IN THIS WAY WE NEED TO BE

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.318

BIRD INGENUITY HERE AND

01:49:37.671 --> 01:49:38.838
ACTUALLY FRANKLY THE LEVEL

01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:41.341

I'D- I ALSO SUPPORT A

01:50:00.727 --> 01:50:02.462
MORATORIUM I THINK- YOU KNOW

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:05.765
WHAT WE LEARNED- ABOUT OUR OUT

01:50:05.832 --> 01:50:08.635
OF STATE PLACEMENTS. INCREDIBLY

01:50:08.702 --> 01:50:12.138
EGREGIOUS- AND REALLY SHOULD

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:13.239
NOT HAVE HAPPENED AND I

01:50:13.306 --> 01:50:14.841
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WE ARE

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.309
LIABLE FOR THE VIOLATIONS

01:50:16.376 --> 01:50:19.012
AGAINST THOSE CHILDREN- AND THE

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:21.948
DEATH YOU KNOW I. I DON'T KNOW

01:50:22.015 --> 01:50:23.516
IF I NECESSARILY AGREE THAT THE

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.552
LEAST AS RESTRICTIVE AS ALWAYS

01:50:25.618 --> 01:50:27.354
THE BEST I THINK WE SHOULD BE

01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.422
TRYING TO FOCUS ON A SETTINGS

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:31.024
AND PLACEMENTS THAT ARE SAFE

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.492
AND THAT ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:35.428
INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF EACH CHILD.

01:50:35.495 --> 01:50:36.896
I THINK WE'VE SORT OF GOTTEN

01:50:36.963 --> 01:50:39.432
AWAY FROM FOSTER CARE JUST LIKE

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:40.800
WE'VE GOTTEN AWAY FROM OUR

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:43.370
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE WE PUT ALL

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:45.438
OF THESE FOLKS IN A BUCKET

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:47.907
THINKING THAT- THERE'S A ONE

01:50:47.974 --> 01:50:49.542
SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH THE

01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:51.177
BIGGER THE NUMBER YOU KNOW THE

01:50:51.244 --> 01:50:52.612
MORE THE MONEY THE MORE THE

01:50:52.679 --> 01:50:54.381
BADS THE PROBLEM WILL BE

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:57.250
SOLVED. WITHOUT REALLY

01:50:57.317 --> 01:51:01.454
RECOGNIZING THAT- EACH PERSON.

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:03.423
HAS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:05.692
INDIVIDUAL TRIGGERS AND NEEDS

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.160
AN INDIVIDUALIZED AND

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:08.595
CUSTOMIZED RESPONSE THAT IS

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:11.297
CONSISTENT- IN ORDER TO HELP

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:13.333
THEM THROUGH WHATEVER THE

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:15.435
CRISES IT IS THAT THEY HAVE.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:17.470
AND I KNOW AS THE STATE EVEN AS

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:18.571
COUNTIES AND CITIES WERE

01:51:18.638 --> 01:51:19.839
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

01:51:19.906 --> 01:51:21.641
SCALABLE WITHOUT NECESSARILY

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:23.376
FOCUSING ON WHAT'S GOING TO BE

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:24.711
SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT PARTICULAR

01:51:24.778 --> 01:51:28.114
PERSON. I RESPECT THE FACT THAT

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:31.351
THERE'S THOUGHTFULNESS TO THIS

01:51:31.418 --> 01:51:31.918
AND I RESPECT THE FACT FACT

01:51:31.985 --> 01:51:34.287
THAT. YOU'RE SAYING IT IS

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:36.856
COMPLEX THIS IS COMPLICATED AND

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:39.893
IT IS COMPLEX. AND TO COME UP

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:41.594
WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.696
BE PERFECT RIGHT NOW. IF

01:51:43.763 --> 01:51:45.165
SOMEONE SAID THAT I WOULD LOOK

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:48.668
AT THEM AND CROSS MY EYES- WE

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:50.236
SHOULD NOT BE THINKING ABOUT

01:51:50.303 --> 01:51:51.371
DEVELOPING SOMETHING THAT'S

01:51:51.438 --> 01:51:52.672
PERFECT RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:55.241
SO I ACTUALLY SEE THIS AS- PART

01:51:55.308 --> 01:51:56.409
OF THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO HOW

01:51:56.476 --> 01:51:58.344
WE RE ENGINEER A SYSTEM. THAT

01:51:58.411 --> 01:51:59.479
WORKS FOR ALL OF THE YOUNG

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:01.081
PEOPLE THAT WILL BE IN IT

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:03.249
RECOGNIZING THAT TAKES TIME

01:52:03.316 --> 01:52:04.851
RECOGNIZING THERE PROBABLY WILL

01:52:04.918 --> 01:52:06.519
BE SOME FALSE STARTS BUT THAT

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:08.655
IS WHEN YOU KNOW. THAT YOU ARE

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:10.523
WORKING TOWARDS SOMETHING THAT

01:52:10.590 --> 01:52:12.392
WILL BE GOOD. BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.726
KICKED THE TIRES YOU HAVE

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:15.528
BROUGHT IN STAKEHOLDERS YOU ARE

01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:17.597
ADDRESSING THE SLIPS AND THE

01:52:17.664 --> 01:52:19.065
FAILURES IN THE SETBACKS AND

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.333
YOU ARE REALLY WORKING TO

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:21.801
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU CAN CREATE A

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:48.827
KNOW HOW HIS FAMILY HAD TREATED

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:49.762

TRACK IT THOSE WHO GO AND APPLY

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:06.745
FOR SUGGESTS THERE IS NO WAY TO

COLLECT THAT DATA I'M EVEN THIS

02:08:08.814 --> 02:08:10.182
BILL DOESN'T REALLY DO THAT.

02:08:10.249 --> 02:08:12.885
BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IF I

02:08:12.951 --> 02:08:15.320
COUNTY KNOWS- AND LEARNS THAT

02:08:15.387 --> 02:08:18.290

LEGAL REPRESENTATION- THE

02:08:23.328 --> 02:08:26.065

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:26.932
GOING TO BUDGETARY PURPOSES IN

02:08:26.999 --> 02:08:29.401
THE FUTURE SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:31.770
MANY PEOPLE NEED THE SUPPORT-

02:08:31.837 --> 02:08:33.539
AND WE CAN'T BUDGET FOR IT

02:08:33.605 --> 02:08:36.108
AFFECTIVELY AND SO THE WAY THAT

02:08:36.175 --> 02:08:37.443
WE'VE AND THIS BILL REALLY

02:08:37.509 --> 02:08:38.544
STARTED OUT AS A FUNDING

02:08:38.610 --> 02:08:40.646
MECHANISM BILL AND IT CAME CAME

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:43.248

MAY NEED TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

02:08:57.663 --> 02:08:59.765
THE SERVICES- AND HOW MANY OF
