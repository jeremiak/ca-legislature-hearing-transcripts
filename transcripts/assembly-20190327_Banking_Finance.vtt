THE CLEAR MISSION OF PROTECTING

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.207

PROTECTIONS.

00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.941
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:35:10.007 --> 00:35:11.642
FIND FINANCIAL ISSUES TO BE

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:14.645
CONFUSING OR NOT IMPORTANT.

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:56.854
NEEDED.

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:59.457

IN THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE.

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.105
AT A TIME WHEN THE FEDERAL

00:37:30.214 --> 00:37:31.616
HOW FEDERALISM AFFECTS CONSUMER

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:39.724
CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS PRIDED

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:41.092
ITSELF ON BEING A LEADER IN

00:37:41.158 --> 00:37:42.593
LOOKING OUT FOR ITS PEOPLE AND

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:46.831
HAS A CHANCE TO DO SO AGAIN HERE.

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:47.965
FINANCIAL REGULATION IS

00:37:48.032 --> 00:37:49.467
ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

00:37:49.533 --> 00:37:50.935
WHO OFTEN FEEL FRUSTRATED OR

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:52.303
MISTREATED IN THE FINANCIAL

FACE AT A PERSONAL LEVEL ARE

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:58.075
MAGNIFIED THROUGHOUT THE ECONOMY.

00:37:58.142 --> 00:37:59.877
THE LAST TWO GENERATIONS HAVE

00:37:59.944 --> 00:38:01.312
SEEN AN EXPLOSION OF CONSUMER

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:04.148
DEBT WHICH IS RISEN FROM ABOUT

00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:05.750
ONE THOUSAND PER PERSON THAN. TO

00:38:05.816 --> 00:38:07.885
MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:38:07.952 --> 00:38:09.220
PER PERSON TODAY.

00:38:09.286 --> 00:38:10.688
THE MASS AVAILABILITY CONSUMER

00:38:10.755 --> 00:38:11.756
CREDIT HAS CREATED NEW

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:13.791
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE AND WE

00:38:13.858 --> 00:38:15.259
SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF THAT.

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:16.927
BUT IT ALSO INCREASES THE RISKS

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.496
THEY FACE AND THE RISKS TO OUR

00:38:18.562 --> 00:38:19.597
ECONOMY.

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:21.065
EXOTIC LENDING IN THE MORTGAGE

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.166
MARKET BROUGHT DOWN THE ENTIRE

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.902
AMERICAN ECONOMY IN.

HOMES AND TRILLIONS IN LOST

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.174
RETIREMENT SAVINGS.

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.742
THE REGULATORS LACK THE TOOLS TO

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.177
MONITOR THE CONSUMER MARKETS

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:34.912
EFFECTIVELY AND MISSED THE TELL%

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.347
TALE SIGNS.

00:38:36.414 --> 00:38:37.448
IN THE END THEY WERE TOO LATE TO

00:38:37.515 --> 00:38:39.750
STOP THE FINANCIAL CRISIS FROM

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:42.053
TURNING INTO THE GREAT RECESSION.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.521
IN THE WAKE OF THAT CATASTROPHE

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.855
WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE WORLDWIDE

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.590
IN SCOPE THE COURSE OF EXPERTS

00:38:46.657 --> 00:38:48.059
CALLED FOR AN OVERHAUL OF

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.960
FINANCIAL REGULATION.

00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:51.896
THEY CONVERGED ON THE TWIN PEAKS

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.197
THEORY WHICH HAS BEEN BROADLY

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.565
ACCEPTED IS THE RIGHT APPROACH

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:56.534
FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.369
IT OPPOSES DISTINCT SEPARATION

00:38:58.436 --> 00:39:00.037
FROM BETWEEN THE FIRST PEAK OF

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.439
FINANCIAL STABILITY.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.007
WERE POTENTIAL REGULATORS ASSURE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.508
THE STABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL

00:39:04.575 --> 00:39:05.776
COMPANIES THEMSELVES.

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.178
AND THE SECOND PEAK OF FINANCIAL

00:39:07.244 --> 00:39:08.813
CONDUCT WHERE OTHER REGULATORS

00:39:08.879 --> 00:39:10.014
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CONSUMER

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.282
PROTECTION.

00:39:11.348 --> 00:39:13.017
THIS APPROACH CREATES EFFICIENCY

00:39:13.084 --> 00:39:14.552
BY HAVING THE SAME REGULATOR

00:39:14.618 --> 00:39:15.619
OVERSEE THE CONDUCT OF BOTH

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.921
CHARTERED BANKS AND OTHER

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:18.689
FINANCIAL COMPANIES WHICH OFTEN

00:39:18.756 --> 00:39:20.024
COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER IN THE

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:21.826
SAME MARKETS SUCH AS MORTGAGE.

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.594
AN AUTO LENDING.

00:39:23.661 --> 00:39:24.662
THE SEPARATION THE TWO MAIN

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:26.964
FUNCTIONS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL TO

00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:28.666
PREVENT ONE OF THESE GOALS FROM

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:29.967
SUBORDINATING THE OTHER.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:32.136
IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY MODEL

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:33.237
THE MISSING FOCUS WAS CONSUMER

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.405
PROTECTION.

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:35.940
WE NEGLECTED -- OVERSIGHT OF THE

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:37.475
CONDUCT THE FINANCIAL COMPANIES

00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:38.943
AND IT COST ALL THIS DEARLY

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.144
INCLUDING FORTY MILLION

00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.746
CALIFORNIANS.

00:39:41.812 --> 00:39:43.614
THE GREAT RECESSION ALSO BROUGHT

00:39:43.681 --> 00:39:44.915
IN A DEEP FISCAL CRISIS IN

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:46.250
CALIFORNIA THAT HAS ONLY

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.252
RECENTLY BEEN HEALED.

IN THE PAST DECADE MOST LARGE

BUT RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA STILL

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.603
OPERATING ON THE OBSOLETE MODEL

00:40:05.669 --> 00:40:06.904
WITH ITS BUILDING CONFLICT OF

00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.205
INTEREST BETWEEN PROMOTING THE

00:40:08.272 --> 00:40:09.240

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.778
CONSUMERS.

00:40:13.844 --> 00:40:15.279
THE TWO GOALS ARE SOMETIMES AT

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:16.881
ODDS AND THE FINANCIAL REGULATOR

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:18.082
DEPENDS IN PART FOR ITS FUNDING

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:21.118
ON DUES PAID BY THESE COMPANIES.

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:22.686

LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:29.393
FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA'S

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.628
DESERVE A MODERNIZE STRUCTURE

00:40:30.694 --> 00:40:32.463
WITH A MORE CONCENTRATED FOCUS

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.332
ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION.

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.802
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE CFPB

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:39.270
WAS CREATED TO FULFILL THIS ROLE.

00:40:39.336 --> 00:40:40.938
IN LESS THAN A DECADE IT'S

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.606

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.116
RIGHT NOW THE CFPB HAS BEEN

RETREATING FROM SOME OF ITS

RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER ITS NEW

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.087
LEADERSHIP.

00:41:30.154 --> 00:41:31.856
IS BACKED AWAY FROM A STRONG

I'M A WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR

MORE ABOUT THESE ISSUES FROM

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.201
OTHER PANELISTS WHO ARE EXPERT

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:45.736
IN THESE AREAS AND WE DISCUSS

00:41:45.803 --> 00:41:47.238
THEM IN MORE DETAIL.

00:41:47.304 --> 00:41:48.639
BUT THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:50.074
CALIFORNIA TO STEP FORWARD TO

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.242
SHORE UP CONSUMER FINANCIAL

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.343
PROTECTION.

00:41:52.409 --> 00:41:53.911
EVEN AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:54.879
IN WASHINGTON IS CURRENTLY

00:41:54.945 --> 00:41:55.880

THE STATE LEVEL.

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:08.859
THEY CAN GO BEYOND FEDERAL

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.661
PROTECTIONS. TO PUT IT SIMPLY

00:42:10.728 --> 00:42:12.529
THE LAW CLEARLY SAYS THAT

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.331
FEDERAL LAW SETS A FLOOR AND NOT

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:16.634
A CEILING ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:18.068
PROTECTION IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.803
CONGRESS THUS OPENED THE DOOR

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:20.871
FOR MORE VIGOROUS PROTECTION OF

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:22.006
CONSUMER RIGHTS THE STATE

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.874
OFFICIALS WHO CAN INSURE THAT

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.809
THESE LAWS ARE STRONG AND THE

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.077
THIRD FORCED EFFECTIVELY.

00:42:27.144 --> 00:42:28.412
THESE EFFORTS NOT ONLY PROTECT

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.648
CONSUMERS WHO SIMPLY DESERVE TO

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:31.882
BE TREATED FAIRLY BY FINANCIAL

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:32.816
COMPANIES.

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:34.318
BUT IT ALSO IN THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.619
LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD BY

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:36.720
PROTECTING MORE ETHICAL

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.455
COMPANIES FROM HAVING TO COMPETE

00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:39.623
AGAINST BAD ACTORS THAT ARE

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.891
WILLING TO CUT CORNERS AND

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:42.693
VIOLATE THE LAW. TO GET AN

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.994
ADVANTAGE IN THE MARKET.

00:42:44.061 --> 00:42:45.796
THAT IS THE WORST FORM OF UNFAIR

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:47.364
COMPETITION AND STRONGER

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:49.733
ENFORCEMENT OF CONSUMER LAWS CAN

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.302
HELP ROUTED OUT.

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.903
WE ALSO NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.405
OF EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.006
RISKS AND CHALLENGES A MORE

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:57.408
COMPLICATED CREDIT PRODUCTS.

00:42:57.474 --> 00:42:58.709
OVER THE PAST DECADE MANY

00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:00.110
CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:00.945
THE HAZARDS OF MORTGAGE

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:02.579
INSTRUMENTS WITH INCREASINGLY

00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:04.248
EXOTIC FEATURES.

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.516
WE NOW HAVE ACCESS TO REVOLVING

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:06.784
CREDIT OFTEN IN MULTIPLE CREDIT

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:07.785
CARD ACCOUNTS WITH DIFFERENT

00:43:07.851 --> 00:43:08.919
INTEREST RATES IN VASTLY

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:10.154
DIFFERENT TERMS.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.488
AND THEY MAY BE JUGGLING VARIOUS

00:43:11.555 --> 00:43:12.890
OTHER CREDIT APPLICATIONS AS

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:13.891
WELL.

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.292
YET NOBODY WOULD CLAIM THAT THIS

00:43:15.359 --> 00:43:16.794
COUNTRY OR THIS STATE IS

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.128
SUDDENLY DOING A BETTER JOB OF

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:19.196
EDUCATING CONSUMERS ABOUT THEIR

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.632
OBLIGATIONS NOT IN THE HOME.

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:23.767
NOT IN SCHOOL NOT AT ORK AND

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:24.935
NOWHERE ELSE.

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:26.337
THAT'S A TASK WE NEED TO TAKE

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:27.604
MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY THAN WE NOW

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.206
DO OR HAVE DONE.

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.174
BY TAKING THE INITIATIVE

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.409
CALIFORNIA TO HELP LEAD OTHER

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:34.578
STATES FORWARD.

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:35.746
THIS WORK MATTERS GREATLY IN OUR

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.214
SOCIETY WHICH IS MARKED RIGHT

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.483
NOW BY GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.185
AND HUGE WEALTH INEQUALITY.

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:42.519
THE FOCUS ON PUTTING MORE MONEY

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:43.854
INTO PEOPLE'S POCKETS SHOULD BE

00:43:43.921 --> 00:43:45.389
MATCHED BY A SIMILAR FOCUS ON

00:43:45.456 --> 00:43:46.724
KEEPING MORE MONEY IN THEIR

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:47.624
POCKETS.

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:48.926
RATHER THAN HAVING IT DRAIN AWAY

00:43:48.993 --> 00:43:50.661
A NICKEL AND DIME FEES FRAUDS

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.596
AND SCAMS WERE ABUSES THAT MAY

00:43:52.663 --> 00:43:54.498
BE PERPETRATED BY BIG FINANCIAL

00:43:54.565 --> 00:43:55.733
COMPANIES.

00:43:55.799 --> 00:43:57.634
IN A SIMPLER ERA BEEN FRANK

00:43:57.701 --> 00:43:58.769
FRANKLIN DECLARED AS POOR

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:00.637
RICHARD'S ALMANAC THAT A PENNY

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:02.206
SAVED IS A PENNY EARNED.

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:03.607
IN TODAY'S WORLD A PENNY SAVED

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.109
FROM FINANCIAL PREDATORS IS A

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:06.443
PENNY THAT IS VERY WELL EARNED

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.578
INDY.

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.946
A SINGLE BAD FINANCIAL

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:10.781
EXPERIENCE CAN RUIN A PERSON OR

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.483
FAMILY AND A CONSTELLATION OF

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:13.984
BAD EXPERIENCES CAN UNDERMINE

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:16.453
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES AS WE SAW IN

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.021
THE RUN UP TO THE FINANCIAL

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:18.355
CRISIS.

00:44:18.422 --> 00:44:19.957
JUST A DECADE AGO.

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:22.126
IN NINETEEN SIXTY TWO PRESIDENT

00:44:22.192 --> 00:44:23.027
KENNEDY GAVE A SPEECH TO

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.261
CONGRESS IN WHICH FOR THE FIRST

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.163
TIME HE SPOKE DIRECTLY ABOUT THE

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.798
ROLE OF THE CONSUMER IN OUR

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:28.966
SOCIETY.

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:30.467
HE NOTED THAT THIS IS A QUOTE

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.436
CONSUMERS BY DEFINITION INCLUDE

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.971
US ALL.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:34.905
THEY'RE THE LARGEST ECONOMIC

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:36.840
GROUP IN THE ECONOMY. TWO THIRDS

00:44:36.907 --> 00:44:38.242
OF ALL SPENDING IN THE ECONOMY

00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:39.543
IS BY CONSUMERS.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.211
BUT THEY'RE THE ONLY IMPORTANT

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:42.813
GROUP IN THE ECONOMY WHO ARE NOT

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.716
EFFECTIVELY ORGANIZED WHOSE

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:46.984
VIEWS ARE OFTEN NOT HEARD.

00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:49.486
HIS WORDS ARE JUST AS TRUE TODAY.

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:50.954
THE PUSH TO PROTECT CONSUMERS

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.489
LATER RESULTED IN SUCH LANDMARK

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.124
BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION IS THE

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:55.659
TRUTH IN LENDING ACT THE EQUAL

00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.127
CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT AND THE

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.829
FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES

00:44:58.896 --> 00:44:59.396
ACT.

00:44:59.463 --> 00:45:00.798
ENACTED UNDER BOTH REPUBLICAN

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:03.767
AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:04.802
THIRTY YEARS LATER THESE EFFORTS

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:05.903
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL HAD FALLEN

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:07.204
BEHIND THE RAPID PACE OF

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:08.205
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FINANCIAL

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:09.540
MARKET PLACE.

00:45:09.606 --> 00:45:10.974
THE LAW IS NEEDED TO BE UPDATED

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:12.276
AND AN OUTMODED REGULATORY

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:13.377
STRUCTURE MEANT THAT THE LAWS

00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.912
WERE BEING SYSTEMATICALLY UNDER

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:17.414
ENFORCED WITH GRAVE CONSEQUENCES

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:18.949
FOR ALL AMERICANS.

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:20.484
THE CFPB WAS AN ESSENTIAL AND

00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:22.119
WELCOME CENTER PIECE OF THESE

00:45:22.186 --> 00:45:23.320
REFORMS.

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.154
AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:25.689
AGAIN SEEMS TO BE ADVOCATING ITS

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.191
ROLE IT'S CRUCIAL FOR THIS

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:28.625
COUNTRY THAT THE STATE TO TAKING

00:45:28.692 --> 00:45:30.294
UP THE MANTLE OF CONSUMER

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.695
FINANCIAL PROTECTION.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:32.830
I'M ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:34.898
CALIFORNIA IS PREPARED TO LEAD

00:45:34.965 --> 00:45:36.066
THE WAY.

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:39.036
THANK YOU I'D BE GLAD TO ANSWER

00:45:39.103 --> 00:45:41.238
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:42.906
THANK YOU MISTER CORDRAY.

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:44.942
MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS.

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:47.344
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:49.580
THANK YOU MISTER CORDRAY AND I

00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.348
ALSO MERCED PRECIADO BEING ABLE

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:52.349
TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE OVER

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:53.750
THE YEARS AS WE'VE BEEN.

00:45:53.817 --> 00:45:55.018
STRUGGLING WITH STUDENT LOANS TO

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:56.620
MOST SERVICES AND I KNOW THAT

00:45:56.687 --> 00:45:58.322
SECTIONS COMING UP A LITTLE BIT.

00:45:58.388 --> 00:45:59.790
WHICH I'M LOOKING FORWARD.

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:01.091
TO BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.193
FOR THE STATE TO STEP IN AND HOW

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.561
DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE AND

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.029
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT WHICH I

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:07.097
BELIEVE IS TRUE THAT.

00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.832
CONGRESS MEANT TO SET THE FLOOR

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:10.567
GIVING US SOME LATITUDE BUT

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:11.902
OFTEN TIMES WHEN WE TRY TO TAKE

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.170
THOSE STEPS.

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.506
THAT PREEMPTION THE NOTION OF

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:17.441
PREEMPTION GETS REYES WHAT IS

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:19.143
THIS AS AN APPROPRIATE STATE

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:20.677
STRUCTURE LOOK LIKE SO THAT WE

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:22.246
CAN HAVE THE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS

00:46:22.312 --> 00:46:23.981
AROUND CONSUMER PROTECTION AND

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:25.782
HAVE.

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:26.617
AN APPROPRIATE.

00:46:26.683 --> 00:46:28.352
PROTECTION SCHEME REGULATORY

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.320
SCHEME TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS

00:46:30.387 --> 00:46:32.122
HAVE THAT BOYS AND THAT WE

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:33.991
PROVIDE THAT THAT BALANCE AND

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.058
THAT PROTECTION.

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.727
SO GOOD QUESTIONS IN THESE ARE I

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:38.462
THINK THE KEY ISSUES WERE

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:39.897
TALKING ABOUT FIRST.

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.365
UP WHAT IS THE STATE STRUCTURE

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:42.933
LOOK LIKE -- IT COULD TAKE A

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:43.867
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:46.436
ADMINISTRATIVE FORMS I THINK AND

00:46:46.503 --> 00:46:48.205
AS I UNDERSTAND THE THE BILL

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:49.106
THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:51.175
RIGHT NOW ITS PRELIMINARY AN

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:52.743
AGNOSTIC AS TO EXACTLY.

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.912
WHERE THIS WOULD BE LOCATED IN

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:55.412
THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT

00:46:55.479 --> 00:46:56.513
APPROACHES TO THAT?

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.182
BUT THE KEY IS THAT THERE BE AN

00:46:58.248 --> 00:47:00.484
INDEPENDENCE OF REGULATION OF

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:02.085
FINANCIAL CONDUCT HOW IT AFFECTS

00:47:02.152 --> 00:47:04.821
CONSUMERS PROTECTING CONSUMERS.

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:06.990
AND REGULATION OF THE SAFETY AND

00:47:07.057 --> 00:47:08.292
SOUNDNESS OF THE INSTITUTIONS

00:47:08.358 --> 00:47:10.194
THEMSELVES IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.562
WITH THE WITH THE REGULATORS

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.797
FACING THE INSTITUTION OR FACING

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:14.298
AWAY FROM THEM TO THEIR

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:15.332
CUSTOMERS.

00:47:15.399 --> 00:47:17.801
AND THE TWO ARE SOMETIMES.

00:47:17.868 --> 00:47:20.204
IN HARMONY AND SOMETIMES AT ODDS

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.105
AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:47:22.172 --> 00:47:23.507
HAVE A INDEPENDENCE OF A

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:24.775
FINANCIAL REGULATOR THIS GOING

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.076
TO PROTECT CONSUMERS.

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:28.312
AGAINST FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:29.313
THAT'S WHAT WE DID AT THE

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:30.147
FEDERAL LEVEL THAT'S WHAT'S

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:31.615
BEING DONE IN MAY MANY COUNTRIES

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:32.449
AROUND THE WORLD.

00:47:32.516 --> 00:47:33.717
AND NOTABLY A NUMBER OF THOSE

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:35.686
COUNTRIES HAVE SMALLER ECONOMIES

00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.754
THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:38.989
STATE CALIFORNIA'S A SAID IS THE

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:39.923
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:41.491
WORLD IF THIS IS THE RIGHT

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:42.859
APPROACH TO FINANCIAL REGULATION

00:47:42.926 --> 00:47:44.595
IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY.

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:45.495
IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH FOR

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.297
CALIFORNIA AND I ALSO THINK

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.498
CALIFORNIA WOULD ESTABLISH

00:47:48.565 --> 00:47:51.134
LEADERSHIP AMONG THE STATE'S UP

00:47:51.201 --> 00:47:52.469
BUT AGAIN AS TO THE

00:47:52.536 --> 00:47:53.704
ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS OF

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.539
EXACTLY WHERE THIS WOULD LANDED

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:57.140
WHAT THE AUTHORITIES WOULD BE I

00:47:57.207 --> 00:47:58.175
THINK THAT THERE'S A PRIDE A

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.109
DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:00.844
THAT COULD BE PURSUED YOU'RE

00:48:00.911 --> 00:48:02.579
ALSO RIGHT TO RAISE THE ISSUE OF

00:48:02.646 --> 00:48:04.414
FEDERAL PREEMPTION THERE WILL BE

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.383
BATTLES AT TIMES OVER FEDERAL

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.284
PREEMPTION.

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.752
OF THAT MAY BE HAPPENING IN

00:48:08.819 --> 00:48:10.754
STUDENT LOANS AND STUDENT LOAN

00:48:10.821 --> 00:48:11.922
SERVICING WE WILL SEE.

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:13.590
UP BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE DODD

00:48:13.657 --> 00:48:14.658
FRANK ACT SPOKE VERY CLEARLY

00:48:14.725 --> 00:48:16.526
ABOUT THIS IT SAID THAT THE

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.128
STATES HAVE LATITUDE TO PROTECT

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:19.329
CONSUMERS.

00:48:19.396 --> 00:48:21.598
UP BEYOND WHAT FEDERAL LAW DOES

00:48:21.665 --> 00:48:22.766
IT ALSO GAVE STATES THE

00:48:22.833 --> 00:48:24.234
AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:26.870
WHICH WAS AN UNUSUAL PROVISION

00:48:26.937 --> 00:48:27.104
BUT IT.

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.871
MADE VERY CLEAR THAT CONGRESS

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.606
INTENDED NOT ONLY TO HAVE A

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:31.174
STRONG PROTECTIONS IN THE LAW

00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:32.809
FOR CONSUMERS BUT THAT THEY BE

00:48:32.876 --> 00:48:34.544
STRONGLY ENFORCED ALL ACROSS THE

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.545
COUNTRY.

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:36.880
AND I THINK THAT THEY RECOGNIZE

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:37.981
THAT THERE WOULD BE A MOMENT

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:39.216
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.084
WOULD BE BACKING AWAY FROM THIS

00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.252
AND THE STATE'S WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:43.086
CARRY.

00:48:43.153 --> 00:48:44.354
A PICK UP THE TORCH AND CARRY

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.623
THE BALL AND I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:47.190
THE MOMENT WE'VE ARRIVED AT

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.825
TODAY.

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:49.960
THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA MAKE

00:48:50.027 --> 00:48:50.994
SURE WE UNDERSCORED EXACTLY

00:48:51.061 --> 00:48:52.796
THOSE POSITIONS AND WE HAVE HAD

00:48:52.863 --> 00:48:54.264
A VERY WILLING PARTNER IN DE

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.033
VITO WHO TENDS TO BE THE

00:48:56.099 --> 00:48:57.367
REGULATORY AGE YOU HAVE.

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:59.536
BY THAT THEN DEPENDS ON THE

00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:01.071
ADMINISTRATOR IT DEPENDS ON THAT

00:49:01.138 --> 00:49:03.307
STRUCTURE AND AND FOR US WITH

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:04.441
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING PERHAPS

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:05.208
THIS HAS BEEN A MISSING

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.010
COMPONENT TO HAVE A CONSUMER

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:08.412
FACING.

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:10.580
ADVOCATE WHO HAS A CERTAIN LEVEL

00:49:10.647 --> 00:49:11.682
OF AUTHORITY.

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:13.617
AND THAT RELATIONSHIP THAN WITH

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:15.285
THE D. B. O. WITH WHAT WHATEVER

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:17.187
THAT STRUCTURE IS.

00:49:17.254 --> 00:49:18.522
IS REALLY WHAT THE MODERN

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:19.623
APPROACH IS AND I THINK THAT'S

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.991
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TO

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.626
FIGURE OUT HERE SO THAT WE DON'T

00:49:22.693 --> 00:49:25.128
OVERLY BURDEN. ONE REGULATOR

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:27.264
WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE OR CREATE

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.265
CONFLICTS WITHIN THAT

00:49:28.332 --> 00:49:29.533
ORGANIZATION.

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:31.702
BUT SET UP PROPRIOCEPTION ISMS

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.470
AND AS CALIFORNIA HAS LED IN

00:49:33.537 --> 00:49:35.038
SOME OF THESE AREAS OTHER STATES

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.873
ARE DEFINITELY FOLLOWING US.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.808
AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:49:37.874 --> 00:49:39.309
BACKING AWAY FROM THEIR

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.944
RESPONSIBILITIES THERE I THINK

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:41.978
IT IS LED TO US SO I THINK THIS

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.347
IS A GOOD APPROPRIATE

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:44.815

AND I I THOUGHT IT WAS

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:41.678
INTERESTING -- IN YOUR COMMENTS

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:43.146
OPENING COMMENTS HOW DO YOU

00:54:43.213 --> 00:54:45.849
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE ETHICAL

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:49.352
COMPANIES VERSES THE BAD ACTORS.

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:50.654
AND HOW THAT THAT CREATES AN

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.188
UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD BUT THE

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:53.757
INTERESTING PART OF THAT WAS YOU

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:54.724
WERE ACTUALLY DRAWING A

00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:56.526
CONCLUSION OF ROOTING OUT THE

00:54:56.593 --> 00:54:58.395
BAD ACTORS BY USING.

00:54:58.461 --> 00:54:59.929
A CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.798
AND FOCUSING ON TAKING CARE OF

00:55:01.865 --> 00:55:03.433
THE CONSUMER AND THAT WOULD HELP

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.101
DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:06.536

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:07.937
WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU TODAY --

00:55:08.004 --> 00:55:10.006
JUST AS A QUESTION AS YOU MOST

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:10.840
LIKELY ARE AWARE OF THE

00:55:10.907 --> 00:55:12.008
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS

00:55:12.075 --> 00:55:14.444
CONSIDERING PUTTING UP 36% CAP

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:17.313
RATE ON INSTALLMENT LOANS OVER

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.214
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:20.216
AND THE THE OPPOSITION THE

00:55:20.283 --> 00:55:22.552
CONVERSATION FROM OPPOSITION HAS

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.554
REALLY BEEN AROUND -- CONSUMER

00:55:24.621 --> 00:55:26.690
PROTECTION VERSES ACCESS TO

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.124
CAPITAL AND WHAT I WOULD BE

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.426
INTERESTED IN IS YOUR

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:31.294
PERSPECTIVE ON THIS AS FAR AS

00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:34.064
DURING YOUR TIME AT SEA -- CFPB --

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:35.131
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.167
REGULATIONS HOW DID YOU WORK TO

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:38.835
ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS ARE

00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.837
PROTECTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:43.273
MAINTAINING ACCESS TO CAPITAL.

00:55:43.339 --> 00:55:44.207
YEAH IT'S IT'S A GREAT QUESTION

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:45.942
OUT OF TRINITY GOING TO LONG AND

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.744
MY ANSWER IF I DO JUST JUST LET

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:50.780
ME KNOW THAT.

00:55:50.847 --> 00:55:51.381
I'VE WORN OUT YOUR PATIENTS.

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.683
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THIS IS THE

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.852
DILEMMA IN TERMS OF SPEAKING TO

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:57.120
SHORT TERM LOANS ARE RATHER

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:58.722
CREDIT MARKETS AS WELL.

00:55:58.788 --> 00:55:59.723
IS BETWEEN PROTECTING THE

00:55:59.789 --> 00:56:01.591
CONSUMER IN PROVIDING ACCESS TO

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:02.625
CREDIT.

00:56:02.692 --> 00:56:04.494
USUALLY THE TWO CAN BE

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:06.830
HARMONIZED PRETTY WELL -- IN

00:56:06.896 --> 00:56:08.531
TERMS OF THE SHORT TERM LENDING

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:09.499
MARKET.

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:12.135
WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT SOME OF

00:56:12.202 --> 00:56:13.436
THE PRODUCTS WE THOUGHT WERE

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.804
QUITE EXPLOITATIVE I MEAN?

00:56:14.871 --> 00:56:17.107
PEOPLE LIVING THEIR LIVES OFF OF

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.708
210031004% RATES OF INTEREST IS

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.643
NOT A RECIPE FOR A SOUND

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:22.011
FINANCIAL FUTURE.

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:23.513
MOST PEOPLE GET INTO THOSE LOANS

00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:24.647
THINKING THEY'RE GOING TO GET

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:25.949
INTO A SHORT TERM LOAN AND GET

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.050
OUT OF IT AGAIN.

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.351
BUT MANY OF THEM GET STOCK THE

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:30.320
END UP PAYING FEE AFTER FEE

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:31.521
THERE NEVER ABLE TO REALLY PAY

00:56:31.588 --> 00:56:33.189
DOWN THE PRINCIPAL THEY WILL END

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.758
UP OFTEN DEFAULTING.

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:35.492
DRIVING THEMSELVES INTO

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:37.894
BANKRUPTCY HAVING PAID OUT

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.163
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS -- AND IT'S

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.765
IT'S REALLY A A MODEL THAT AIMED

00:56:41.831 --> 00:56:43.767
AT THE CONSUMER WHO IS NOT ABLE

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:45.201
TO REPAY THE LOAN WHICH IS NOT A

00:56:45.268 --> 00:56:46.803
NORMAL TYPE OF LENDING NORMALLY

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.838
A LENDER WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE

00:56:48.905 --> 00:56:50.607
BORROWER CAN REPAY THE LOAN

00:56:50.673 --> 00:56:51.908
BEFORE THEY MAKE THE LA.

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:52.942
BUT IF YOU CAN FIND A MODEL

00:56:53.009 --> 00:56:54.210
WHERE YOU CAN MAKE ENOUGH MONEY

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.779
OFF OF THAT BORROWER WE DON'T

00:56:55.845 --> 00:56:57.180
HAVE TO CARE IN THE END WHETHER

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.782
THE EVEN REPAY THEIR LOAN.

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.617
THAT TO ME IS A BROKEN MARKET AT

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:01.885
THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE APPROACH

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:04.154
THAT BY ADOPTING AN INABILITY TO

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.855
REPAIR A RULE THAT IT BEFORE

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.290
MAKING A SHORT TERM LOAN YOU HAD

00:57:07.357 --> 00:57:07.957
TO ASSESS.

00:57:08.024 --> 00:57:10.527
REASONABLY ASSESS IN A SHORTHAND

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.594
WAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THE

00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.396
SAME UNDERWRITING FURS FOR SHORT

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:15.799
TERM LOAN -- THAT THE PERSON HAD

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:17.233
THE REASONABLE ABILITY TO REPAY

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.869
THAT LOAN -- WHEN IT CAME DUE?

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:20.970
OUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.338
AUTHORITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:24.174
UNDER OUR LAW TO IMPOSE A RATE

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.008
CAPS.

00:57:25.074 --> 00:57:26.509
THAT'S WHAT MANY STATES HAVE

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.211
DONE IN FACT BY THE WAY AS I'M

00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.078
SURE YOU KNOW.

00:57:29.145 --> 00:57:30.580
STATES TYPICALLY HAVE HAD RATE

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:33.216
CAPS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.450
IT WAS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THEY

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:35.952
ALLOWED EXCEPTIONS TO THE RATE

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:37.453
CAPS THAT FACILITATED A PAYDAY

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.055
LENDING INDUSTRY.

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.557
AND MANY STATES NEVER.

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:42.659
NEVER WENT THAT DIRECTION OR

00:57:42.725 --> 00:57:44.260
HAVE REVERTED BACK TO IT.

00:57:44.327 --> 00:57:45.628
AND IT'S ABOUT NINETY MILLION

00:57:45.695 --> 00:57:47.797
AMERICANS LIVE IN STATES WITH

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:51.835
36% -- CAP OR THEREABOUTS -- AND

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:53.069
IS PEOPLE.

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:53.903
SEEM TO GET ALONG JUST FINE

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:54.470
THEY'RE NOT WORSE OFF THAN

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.639
ELSEWHERE -- AND THERE'S LOTS OF

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:59.008
ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE ALTHOUGH

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:00.810
THEY HAVE TO FIND THEM -- AND I

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.412
THINK THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE IN

00:58:02.478 --> 00:58:06.049
CALIFORNIA -- SO AGAIN ACCESS TO

00:58:06.115 --> 00:58:07.317
CREDIT IS IMPORTANT BUT IT

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:08.651
SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE CREDIT.

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:10.053
AND IF IT'S CREDIT IT'S

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.688
PREDATORY AND IT'S GONNA DRIVE

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:13.590
PEOPLE INTO OUT WORSE FINANCIAL

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.792
SITUATIONS THAT I THINK WE NEED

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:18.294
TO PUT MORE EMPHASIS ON THE

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:18.595
PROTECTIONS.

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:20.797

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.186
IMPORTANT TO AMONG MANY OF THE

00:58:43.253 --> 00:58:45.054

00:58:55.131 --> 00:58:56.032
INTO.

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.600
BUT SOMETIMES I GUESS I THEY

00:58:57.667 --> 00:58:59.202
HAVE NO CHOICE TO ONCE THEY GET

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.536
INTO AND THEY CANNOT MEET THE

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.872

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:27.897
THAT THEY CAN -- HAVE A BETTER.

00:59:27.964 --> 00:59:31.134
MALL COMPARISON SHOPPING RATHER

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.869
THAN HAVING FOR HIM.

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:35.305
LIMITED TO TO A SUDDEN BAD

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:36.839
COMPANY SYSTEMS SPEAKER.

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.311
FEEDBACK CUT TO THAT.

00:59:41.377 --> 00:59:44.647
I'M WONDERING -- YOU ARE SAYING

00:59:44.714 --> 00:59:46.482
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OF

00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:49.118
CURRENTLY IS THAT THE FOURTEEN

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:53.289
IN -- REGULATING -- THE SOME OF

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.824
THE OBLIGATIONS SO.

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.993
UNDER FEDERAL LAW IS THAT THE

00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.162
FED THE WORST JOB WHY ARE IS

00:59:59.228 --> 01:00:01.097
THAT THE AGENCY IS SO IN THE

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.632
STATE THAT WE NEED.

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.133
TO REGULATE.

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.069
AND THE IF YOU CAN GIVE ME SOME

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:12.041
SPECIFIC XAMPLES OF WHAT THE IN

THE AREA SO.

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:13.543
INSTANCES SAID THAT THE FEDERAL

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.011
GOVERNMENT THIS AT THE FOURTEEN

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.946
IN REGULATING THEIR LAW OKAY

01:00:17.013 --> 01:00:18.448
OKAY GOOD AND BY THE WAY I I

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:19.549
AGREE WITH YOU I THINK MORE

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.284
CONSUMER CHOICE IS GENERALLY

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:21.818
GOOD.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.720
ALTHOUGH IF THAT CHOICE CROSSES

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.154
THE BOUNDS INTO THE POTENTIALLY

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:27.056
FRAUDULENT AND EXPLOITATIVE AS

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:28.825
WE SAW SOME OF THE EXOTIC

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.460
MORTGAGE MORTGAGE PRODUCTS

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:32.528
LEADING UP THE CRISIS THEN -- IT

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:33.997
IT IT CROSSES THE LINE AND IT

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:36.399
NEEDS TO BE RAINED OUT BACK IN.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.468
IN TERMS OF WHERE OF THIS THE

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.769
STATE COULD BE STEPPING UP FIRST

01:00:39.836 --> 01:00:41.537
OF ALL UNDER UNDER THE DODD

01:00:41.604 --> 01:00:42.872
FRANK ACT INTERESTINGLY IN THIS

01:00:42.939 --> 01:00:44.474
IS NOT THE NORMAL.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.409
APPROACH IT SPECIFIED THAT STATE

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.877
OFFICIALS HAD THE ABILITY TO

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.779
ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW THEY SEEM TO

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.047
BE QUITE CONCERNED THAT FEDERAL

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:52.115
LAW WOULD BE SYSTEMATICALLY

01:00:52.181 --> 01:00:53.850
UNDER ENFORCED AND THEY WANTED

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.018
TO BRING MORE.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.053
TEAMMATES TO THE TO THE JOB OF

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.354
MAKING SURE FEDERAL LAW WAS

01:00:58.421 --> 01:01:00.490
ENFORCED SO CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.025
THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:05.194
LAW. TO A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE IN

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:06.963
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION SO

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.699
THAT'S ONE PIECE -- ALSO IT HAS

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:10.299
THE AUTHORITY TO PASS ITS OWN

01:01:10.366 --> 01:01:10.900
LOS.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:12.201
AREAS WHERE I WOULD SAY THAT I

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:13.770
THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:01:13.836 --> 01:01:15.671
BEEN PULLING BACK I'M MENTIONED

01:01:15.738 --> 01:01:17.306
A FEW OF IN MY TESTIMONY.

01:01:17.373 --> 01:01:20.243
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN --

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.178
NOT BEEN -- EXERTING THE PROPER

01:01:22.245 --> 01:01:24.313
OVERSIGHT OVER STUDENT LOAN

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.215
SERVICERS WHO ARE CAUSING ALL

01:01:26.282 --> 01:01:27.483
KINDS OF PROBLEMS FOR STUDENT

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.651
LOAN BORROWERS.

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:29.786
I THINK THAT THEY'RE WALKING

01:01:29.852 --> 01:01:31.220
BACK FROM THE PAYDAY LENDING

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:32.855
RULE WHICH WOULD HAVE IMPOSED A

01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:36.192
REASONABLE.

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:38.294
MODEST -- PUBLICATION ON LENDERS

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.395
TO ASSESS THE REBEL BILLETED

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:41.130
REPAIR OF THE POWER BEFORE

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:43.166
MAKING THE LOAN -- AND THEY HAVE

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.568
WALKED AWAY FROM PREVENTIVE

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.503
REGULATION UNDER THE MILITARY

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.472
LENDING ACT WHICH WHICH AGAIN IS

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.340
MEANT TO PROTECT OUR SERVICE

01:01:51.407 --> 01:01:53.109
MEMBERS IN OF VULNERABLE

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:54.677
POPULATION WHO.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.480
IF THEY'RE DEPLOYED IN OVERSEAS.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.981
HE REALLY THEY REALLY CAN'T BE

01:01:59.048 --> 01:01:59.982
MONITORING THEIR FINANCIAL

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.185
AFFAIRS BACK HOME VERY WELL AND

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.886
SO WITH THE CONGRESS VERY

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:05.388
SENSIBLY IMPOSED A LIMIT.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:06.689
ON THE INTEREST RATE THAT COULD

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:08.391
BE CHARGED ON PRODUCTS TO THE

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.460
MILITARY AS A WAY OF PROTECTING

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.727
THEM AND SIMPLIFYING THEIR LIVES

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:13.529
SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON DOING WHAT

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:15.298
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO WHICH IS --

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.866
RISKING THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:18.201
ALL OF US SO.

01:02:18.267 --> 01:02:19.335
THESE ARE AREAS WHERE THEY

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.470
WALKED BACK I DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.505
AREAS FURTHER IS THEY MAY WALK

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:23.473
BACK FROM.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:25.041
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR STATES TO

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.610
STEP UP IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN IS

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:29.479
THE LARGEST ECONOMY THE LARGEST

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.347
STATE IN THE NATION AND A REAL

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.116
LEADER WHOSE EXAMPLE WOULD

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.551
MATTER TO OTHER STATES AND BRING

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:36.853
THEM ALONG I THINK.

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:38.154
AS YOU INDICATED THOSE OTHER

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:41.724
AREAS -- THAT THE WE SEE YOU SEE

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:44.627
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE OF CLOSELY

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:47.530
MONITORED THE AND IN CALIFORNIA

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.499
WHICH AGENCY IS SOMEONE

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:52.668
RESPONSIBLE TO WILL MONITOR.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:53.769
AND ENFORCE THE LAW.

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:54.904
WELL AS I UNDERSTAND IT THERE'S

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:56.873
THERE'S TWO POSSIBILITIES HERE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:57.707
ONE IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.509
OFFICE AND ONE IS THE DEPARTMENT

01:02:59.575 --> 01:03:01.277
OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT -- WE

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.212
WORKED WELL WITH BOTH -- THE

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.914
CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL A AND

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:06.048
WHEN HE WAS IN CONGRESS BEFORE

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:08.584
THAT AND ALSO -- THE HEAD OF THE

01:03:08.651 --> 01:03:10.052
DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:12.255
BUT I THINK IT DOES MATTER IF

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:15.191
THE STRUCTURE -- SECURES THIS

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.326
PROTECTION AND IT DOESN'T DEPEND

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:19.295
ONLY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND ALSO

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.930
THERE CAN BE SUCH A THING AS TOO

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:22.732
MANY JOBS BEING GIVEN TO ONE

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:24.667
INDIVIDUAL. TO OVERSEE THE

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.569
LICENSING AND THEN THE SAFETY

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:27.904
AND SOUNDNESS OF ALL OF THESE

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.472
DIFFERENT FINANCIAL COMPANIES

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.207
AND THERE'S THOUSANDS OF THEM.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:32.808
AND THEN ALSO TO BE EXPECTED TO

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.510
PROTECT CONSUMERS IT'S VERY

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:36.112
DIFFICULT TO GET THE RIGHT FOCUS

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.780
ON THAT AND THAT'S WHY AROUND

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:39.348
THE WORLD OVER NOW OVER NOW

01:03:39.415 --> 01:03:40.716
COUNTRIES ARE SPLITTING THOSE

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:43.186
TWO THINGS SO THAT EACH OF THEM.

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:43.819
CAN HAVE SOMEBODY DEDICATED TO

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:46.689
BEING -- WHOLLY FOCUSED ON THAT

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.858
PARTICULAR JOB.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.693
MAYBE THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT THE

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.061
SOME.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.663
IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE A IN A

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:54.597
BETTER ENFORCEMENT.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.600
OKAY.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.134
THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:03:58.201 --> 01:03:59.602

01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:01.337
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MISTER

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.705
CORDRAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:03.639
COMING TODAY THIS IS THE FIRST

01:04:03.706 --> 01:04:05.608
OPPORTUNITY THAT I'VE I'VE I'VE

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:06.175
HAD TO MEET YOU SO IT'S A

01:04:06.242 --> 01:04:08.144
PLEASURE -- DID HAVE YOU

01:04:08.211 --> 01:04:10.279
SPEAKING WITH US TODAY I I'M%

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:11.681
LOOKING THROUGH YOUR PURE

01:04:11.747 --> 01:04:13.049
PRINTED TESTIMONY.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:15.651
AND I SEE WHERE YOU SAY THAT IN

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:16.886
LESS THAN.

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:17.853
I THINK REFERRING TO YOUR

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.822
LEADERSHIP AT CFPB THAT IN LESS

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:21.257
THAN A DECADE ED PROVED TO BE A

01:04:21.324 --> 01:04:22.491
GREAT SUCCESS.

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.926
AND THEN IT FURTHER GOES ON TO

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:25.528
STATE THAT NOW YOU FEEL THAT --

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.697
CPB IS RETREATING FROM SOME OF

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.932
ITS RESPONSIBILITIES -- UNDER

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:31.434
NEW LEADERSHIP SO IT SEEMS YOU

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.803
ARE TRYING TO TO TO DRIVE VERY

01:04:33.869 --> 01:04:36.038
DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN THEIR ROLE

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:37.807
IN THEIR SUCCESS AS WHEN YOU

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.942
WERE THERE AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.077
IS NOW IS THAT AN INCORRECT

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.712
ASSUMPTION FOR ME TO ME YEAH

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:43.179
ALTHOUGH.

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:45.114
ALTHOUGH -- THAT'S A LITTLE

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:47.149
OVERSTATED BECAUSE THE NUMBERS

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:48.251
THAT THEY GAVE YOU HERE ARE

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:49.518
NUMBERS THAT INCLUDE SOME WORK

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.620
THAT'S BEEN DONE UNDER MY

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:51.988
SUCCESSORS.

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:52.822
SO THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.423
ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS I THINK THE

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.259
NUMBER WAS TWELVE BILLION.

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:57.159
UNDER THE SIX YEARS THAT I WAS

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.028
THERE IT'S NOW TWELVE POINT FOUR

01:04:59.095 --> 01:05:00.062
BILLION SO THEY'VE TAKEN SOME

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:01.964
ENFORCEMENT ACTION SINCE THEN

01:05:02.031 --> 01:05:02.465
THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETELY

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.267
RETREATED -- THE NUMBER OF

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.002
CONSUMER COMPLAINTS HANDLED WAS

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.536
ONE POINT THREE MILLION AT THE

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.372
TIME I LEFT AND IT'S NOW UP OVER

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.840
ONE POINT SIX PROBABLY ONE POINT

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.408
SEVEN OR ONE POINT EIGHT SO THEY

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.809
CONTINUE TO WORK IN THOSE AREAS.

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:14.777
THEY HAVEN'T RETREATED ACROSS

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:16.379
THE BOARD FROM EVERYTHING BUT

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:17.213
THEY'VE RETREATED ON SOME KEY

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.215
ISSUES AND I'M WORRIED THAT THEY

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.950
MAY RETREAT SOME MORE BUT IN

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.285
GENERAL YES THAT'S THE

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.719
DISTINCTION I WAS.

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:25.354
TRYING TO POSE WAS BETWEEN

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.023
AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS TO PROTECT

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:31.560
CONSUMERS AND WHAT I THINK HAVE

01:05:31.627 --> 01:05:33.829
HAVE BEEN -- SOMEWHAT SOMEWHAT --

01:05:33.896 --> 01:05:34.730
LESS AGGRESSIVE EFFORTS

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:36.532
CERTAINLY UNDER THE CRY THINK

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:37.066
THEY WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.167
THEMSELVES.

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:41.037
OKAY WELL THAT'S FAIR ENOUGH OF

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.938
AN ANSWER -- UNDER YOUR

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:46.008
LEADERSHIP WERE YOU -- I GUESS

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.010
WERE YOU ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:50.079
INVESTIGATE THE WELLS FARGO

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.547
FRAUD THAT WAS TAKING PLACE.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:53.516
BUT WE WERE AND WE DID THAT

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.017
THROUGH A TEAM EFFORT INCLUDING

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.652
THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY'S

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.621
OFFICE WHO PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.057
ROLE IN THAT -- AND WE HAD THE

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.758
FEDERAL PARTNER THE OCC WHO WAS

01:06:02.825 --> 01:06:05.628
PART OF THAT AS WELL BUT YES WE

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.063
WERE ABLE TO EXPOSE.

01:06:07.129 --> 01:06:08.664
WHAT WAS THE SIGNIFICANT SCANDAL

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:10.099
AND ONE THAT STILL SHOCKS A LOT

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:11.400
OF PEOPLE THAT THERE COULD HAVE

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.502
BEEN MILLIONS OF CREDIT CARD AND

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:14.637
BANKING ACCOUNTS?

01:06:14.704 --> 01:06:17.606
OPEN BY EMPLOYEES OF WELLS FARGO.

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.075
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OR CONSENT

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.910
OF CUSTOMERS I MEAN WHAT WE

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:22.345
THINK ABOUT WHEN WE PUT OUR

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.446
MONEY IN A BANK WE ASSUME THAT

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:26.115
IT WILL BE KEPT SAFE THERE.

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.416
THAT THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING WITH

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:28.784
IT THAT WE DON'T INTEND THEM TO

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:30.252
DO AND THAT WILL KNOW EVERYTHING

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.587
THAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR MONEY

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.289
THAT'S THE KIND OF TRUST THAT

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:34.690
THIS RELATIONS BUILD UPON.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.258
AND WELLS FARGO VIOLATED THAT

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.761
TRUST VERY SEVERELY I THINK

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:40.830
WHICH CAUSED ALL THE OUTRAGE.

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:42.798
OKAY WELL IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

01:06:42.865 --> 01:06:46.769
THAT -- CFPB WASN'T REALLY

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.504
TERRIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPOSING

01:06:48.571 --> 01:06:49.872
THAT PRIDE AND THAT WAS PART OF

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.207
THE FAILURE OF THE DEPARTMENT IN

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:53.342
GENERAL -- THERE YOU MAY

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:55.411
DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.613
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THE I. G.'S

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.749

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:41.290
CLEAR LINE OF DISTINCTION

01:07:41.357 --> 01:07:44.093
BETWEEN -- YOUR POLITICS AND THE

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.694
POLITICS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.029
RESIDE IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND

01:07:47.096 --> 01:07:47.730

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:52.201
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.636
ADVANTAGE OF AND EXPLOITED.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.104

YOU THAT IS VERY POLITICALLY

01:08:12.621 --> 01:08:14.356
MOTIVATED AND REALLY THAT'S NOT

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:15.624
WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO TODAY I

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.525

TO DO IS ACCOMPLISH THE SAME TAX

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:30.799
WHICH IS.

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.134
MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:32.768
THANK YOU OKAY WELL WELL IF I

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.203
MAY.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.905
I ALSO THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:38.007
TO ME WHETHER YOU'RE REPUBLICAN

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.341
OR DEMOCRAT OR INDEPENDENT I

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:40.643
DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD MATTER.

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:42.645
YOUR CONSUMER YOUR SOMEBODY WHO

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:44.280
PARTICIPATES IN OUR ECONOMY AND

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.681
YOU HAVE RIGHT TO BE TREATED

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:47.349
FAIRLY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:48.384
SHOULD BE.

01:09:48.450 --> 01:09:49.552
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PROTECTIONS

01:09:49.618 --> 01:09:50.686
ABOUT SO I AGREE WITH YOU THAT

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.021
REALLY SHOULD NOT BE POLITICAL

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.522
I'D WISH THAT IT WOULD NEVER

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:55.357
BECOME POLITICAL IN WASHINGTON

01:09:55.424 --> 01:09:56.392
BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.126
WHO.

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.761
TRIED TO POLITICIZE IT SOME OF

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:00.296
THE THINGS THAT YOU REFERRED TO

01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:02.064
WERE ACTUALLY NOT TRUE THEY WERE

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.999
PART OF THE POLITICAL THEATER

01:10:04.066 --> 01:10:05.034
THAT SURROUNDED.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.101
THE BEER AT TIMES WE NEVER HAD

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:08.604
ANY SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:09.204
YOU SAID THAT WOULD THAT WOULD

01:10:09.271 --> 01:10:11.607
NOT -- WE DID COMPLY WITH

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:13.108
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT NOT

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.643
ALWAYS TO THEIR SATISFACTION BUT

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:16.745
WE PRODUCE THOUSANDS OF

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:19.415
DOCUMENTS TO THEM -- AND AND

01:10:19.481 --> 01:10:22.651
CONSTANTLY SOUGHT TO RESPOND. TO

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.654
THEIR DEMANDS.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:28.257
IN IN TERMS OF WHETHER -- I SAW

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.025
THIS IS POLITICAL OR NOT I

01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.961
SAUCES TRYING TO WORK TO PROTECT

01:10:32.027 --> 01:10:34.229
CONSUMERS -- YOU AND YOUR FAMILY

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:36.432
AND AND YOUR FAMILY'S FAMILY AND

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:37.466
EVERYBODY ELSE HERE AND THEIR

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.201
FAMILIES FAMILY THAT'S WHAT WE

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.469
WERE TRYING TO DO.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.004
AND BY THE WAY WE RESPONDED TO

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.706
LOTS AND LOTS OF COMPLAINTS THAT

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.307
WERE FORWARDED TO US FROM THE

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:46.542
OFFICES OF REPUBLICAN

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:48.544
CONGRESSMEN AND AND DEMOCRATIC

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:49.645
CONGRESSMAN.

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.946
DIDN'T MATTER TO US THEY WERE

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:52.414
AMERICANS THEY WERE PEOPLE WE

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:53.983
WERE SUPPOSED TO SERVE AND WE

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:55.117
WORK TO SERVE THEM.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:57.453
AND SO -- AND MAYBE WE CAN FIND

01:10:57.519 --> 01:10:58.754
SOME COMMON GROUND HERE AROUND

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:01.090
HERE YOUR POINT WHICH I VERY

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.658
MUCH AGREE WITH AND ACCEPT.

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:04.360
THAT THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT

01:11:04.426 --> 01:11:06.629
PROTECTING PEOPLE ARE AND MAKING

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:07.896
REASONABLE JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.665
BEST TO DO THAT AND I DO THINK

01:11:09.732 --> 01:11:11.634
AGAIN CALIFORNIA CAN BE A LEADER

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.368
IN THAT.

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.736
IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:16.538
THE COUNTRY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TO

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:17.439
TAKE ON THAT ROLE.

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:18.007
THANK YOU.

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.975
THANK YOU NUMBER AT GRAYSON THEN

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.610
CERVANTES.

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.746
THANK YOU FOR REPEAT CHAIR AND

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.581
MADAM CHAIR I I JUST WANT TO

01:11:25.648 --> 01:11:26.915
FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THAT.

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.517
IS IMPORTANT TO WERE WHERE WE'RE

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:30.152
AT TODAY AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:31.720
AND THE PRESSURES.

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:34.156
THAT WERE FACING -- IN THE STATE

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.458
AS FAR AS THE SMALL DOLLAR

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.327
LENDING AND THE TRIPLE DIGIT

01:11:38.394 --> 01:11:39.228
RATE.

01:11:39.294 --> 01:11:42.231
THAT -- IF -- IN YOUR EXPERIENCE

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:45.067
WE HEAR THAT RATE CAPS WILL LEAD

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:46.568
TO LESS ACCESS FOR PEOPLE AND

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.771
THEN PUSH THEM INTO AN

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.205
UNREGULATED INTERNET.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.374
TYPE ENVIRONMENT OR MARKET OF

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:53.108
LENDING.

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:55.444
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OR IN YOUR

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:57.980
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WHAT DO YOU OR

01:11:58.047 --> 01:11:59.648
HOW DO YOU SEE CONSUMER

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:01.817
CONSUMERS RESPONDING TO A RATE

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.752
CAP AND HAVING A MORE

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:06.221
ADVANTAGEOUS REGULATED MARKET.

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.990
YEAH I THINK WE CAN AGAIN WE CAN

01:12:08.057 --> 01:12:09.491
LOOK UPON THE EXPERIENCE OF

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:10.826
THEIR SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:13.929
STATES THEY HAVE A RATE CAP IT'S

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.731
ABOUT NINETY MILLION AMERICANS --

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.666
AND PEOPLE IN THOSE STATES DON'T

01:12:17.733 --> 01:12:19.668
HAVE ACCESS TO THESE HIGH COST

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.103
PAYDAY LOANS.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.337
AND THEY TEND TO DO WHETHER

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.239
THINKS THEY CAN GET A PAYMENT

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.774
PLANS FROM UTILITY COMPANIES

01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:26.909
THEY CAN GET.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.644
LOANS FROM CREDIT UNIONS WHICH

01:12:28.711 --> 01:12:30.646
FILL THE GAPS ENORMOUSLY IN THIS

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:33.115
AREA AND COMMUNITY BANKS OFTEN

01:12:33.182 --> 01:12:34.817
WILL MAKE SUCH LOANS.

01:12:34.883 --> 01:12:36.919
THEY CAN USE CREDIT CARDS AND

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:37.920
CREDIT CARD VANCE'S WHICH ARE

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:40.155
NOT CHEAP BUT CONSIDERABLY LESS

01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:41.857
EXPENSIVE THAN A PAYDAY LOAN --

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.093
THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITY AND AND

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.894
THAT CHURCH BASED OPTIONS THAT

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.563
PEOPLE CAN DO OR GO TO FRIENDS

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:48.731
AND FAMILY LOTS OF DIFFERENT

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.899
THINGS THE UNREGULATED INTERNET

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:52.634
IS REALLY NOT AN ANSWER BECAUSE

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:54.737
IT IS ILLEGAL. FOR A COMPANY TO

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.405
MAKE LOANS INTO A STATE WITH

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.340
RATE CAPS IF THOSE LOANS VIOLATE

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.775
THE RATE CAPS NOW IT'S NOT

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.443
ALWAYS EASY TO ENFORCE THAT.

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:02.745
AGAINST OUT OF STATE OR EVEN

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:05.280
INTERNATIONAL A COMPANIES MANY

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:07.182
OF WHICH ARE FRAUDULENT TO THEIR

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.885
CORE -- BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:12.588
LAW AS IT STANDS SO AGAIN THAT'S

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:17.059
NOT AN EASY ISSUE -- BUT WHAT I

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:18.260
WOULD -- RECOMMEND IS WE FOUND A

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:19.895
LOT OF INSIGHT ON THOSE ISSUES

01:13:19.962 --> 01:13:21.697
FROM FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:22.798
FROM.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.733
MINISTERS AND PRIESTS AND NUNS

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:26.135
AND RABBIS WHO HAD MEMBERS OF

01:13:26.201 --> 01:13:27.803
THE CONGREGATION COME TO THEM

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.204
AND DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCES.

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.439
AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THAT

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.107
INSIGHT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:33.308
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.110
DO COPE WITH THESE WITH THESE

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:36.478
ISSUES AND THEY DO.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.679
BUT PUTTING THEM INTO THREE

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.414
ENTERED 4% LOANS DOESN'T BUILT

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.683
THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE IT JUST

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:43.051
DOESN'T THANK YOU.

01:13:43.118 --> 01:13:44.953
DECEMBER CERVANTES THANK YOU

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.922
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY

01:13:46.989 --> 01:13:47.990
AND JOINING US IN THIS

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.659
CONVERSATION FOR THE PAST DECADE

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:51.994
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:55.564
pMEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:57.533
ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE

01:13:57.599 --> 01:14:00.135
TARGETED BY PREDATORY LENDING

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.236
UNTIL RECENTLY HAS BEEN UNDER

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:02.704
THE MILITARY LENDING ACT THE

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.106
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE REQUIRED

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.607
SUPERVISORY.

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.643
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE C. F. P.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:10.145
P. B. CAN YOU SHARE WITH US THE

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:13.448
RAMIFICATIONS OR IMPACTS THAT.

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:14.683
ARE THIS HAS HAD TO SERVICE

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:15.884
MEMBERS VETERANS AND THEIR

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.786
FAMILIES AND WHAT WE CAN DO IS A

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:19.321
STATE TO ADDRESS IT.

01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:20.756
YEAH BUT IT'S IT'S A GREAT

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.624
QUESTION IT'S A CONCERN

01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:24.159
CURRENTLY I THINK.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.294
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE THAT

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.762
SERVICE MEMBERS ESPECIALLY ON

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.931
SERVICE MEMBERS ARE TARGETED BY

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.966
PREDATORY LENDERS. FOR TWO

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:31.900
REASONS ONE IS MANY OF THEM ARE

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.869
YOUNG THEIR WAY FROM HOME FOR

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:35.404
THE FIRST TIME IF YOU.

01:14:35.470 --> 01:14:37.806
LOOK AT THE MAPPING OF WHERE

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:40.209
LENDERS SET AROUND MILITARY

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.377
BASES THEY CONGREGATE THERE THEY

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:43.512
KNOW THEY HAVE A GUARANTEED

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.781
PAYCHECK FROM THE US GOVERNMENT

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:47.783
SO THEY ARE RIPE TARGETS -- FOR

01:14:47.850 --> 01:14:49.918
ABUSE AND THAT'S I BELIEVE MY

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.186
BIG PART OF WHY THE MILITARY

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.188
LENDING ACT WAS PASSED WHICH

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:57.025
CAPS THE RATE ON LOANS -- TO

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.894
SERVICE MEMBERS -- THESE ARE

01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:00.195
PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA END UP

01:15:00.262 --> 01:15:01.864
DEPLOYING THERE'S A LOT OF

01:15:01.930 --> 01:15:02.865
TRAINING THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:04.399
THEM AND IF THEY END UP WITH

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:05.500
SOME PROBLEM WITH THEIR KIDS

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:07.169
SECURITY CLEARANCE HAS FINANCIAL

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:08.604
PROBLEMS CAN LEAD THEM.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.172
TO THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE THING

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:11.139
FOR US TO LOSE THAT SERVICE

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.875
MEMBER AND HAVE TO TRAIN SOMEONE

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:13.775
ALL OVER AGAIN TO GO INTO THEIR

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:15.844
PLACE OR GOD FORBID THAT THEY BE

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.412
DISTRACTED FROM THEIR DANGEROUS

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.715
MISSION OVERSEAS BY TRYING TO

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.350
DEAL WITH SOMETHING BACK HOME --

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:23.018
THAT -- THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:24.620
HAVE TO DEAL WITH SO THAT'S THE

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:25.821
THAT'S THE THINKING THAT WENT

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.223
INTO THE MILITARY LENDING ACT.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.658
NOW THE THE THE POINT YOU'RE

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:31.326
RAISING IS THAT RIGHT NOW THIS

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.661
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CFPB IS

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:33.962
WALKING BACK.

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.797
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:37.399
THE MILITARY LANDING ACT -- THE

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.433
QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY HAVE

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.469
THE AUTHORITY TO USE PREVENTIVE

01:15:40.535 --> 01:15:42.571
MEASURES SUCH AS SUPERVISING

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:43.906
ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:15:43.972 --> 01:15:44.673
COMPLYING WITH THE MILITARY

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:45.607
LANDING ACT.

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:47.242
I SHOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT TO

01:15:47.309 --> 01:15:48.877
HAVE THEM USE THE PREVENTIVE

01:15:48.944 --> 01:15:51.346
SUPERVISORY MEASURES TO ROOT OUT

01:15:51.413 --> 01:15:52.648
THESE PROBLEMS RATHER THAN.

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.916
PUTTING THE ONUS ON SERVICE

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.317
MEMBERS TO HAVE TO COMPLAIN TO

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.152
THEM ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT THEY'VE

01:15:57.219 --> 01:15:59.922
ALREADY RUN INTO -- I'VE HEARD

01:15:59.988 --> 01:16:02.124
IT HEARD THE COMPARISON MADE TO

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.792
PREVENTING OF FIRE RATHER THAN

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.360
PULLING SOMEBODY OUT OF A FIRE

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.261
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO PULL

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:07.329
SOMEBODY OUT OF A FIRE WHEN

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.298
THEY'RE A SERVICE MEMBER WHO MAY

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:10.832
BE SERVING OVERSEAS ARE IN A

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.067
DANGEROUS OCCUPATION --

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:14.303
IMPORTANT TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:16.538
COUNTRY SO THE PREVENTIVE

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:18.206
MEASURE THAT THEY SEE A BABY'S

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.508
WALK BACK FROM I ACTUALLY THINK

01:16:19.574 --> 01:16:20.876
IS REALLY THE FIRST THING THEY

01:16:20.943 --> 01:16:24.780
SHOULD BE DOING HERE.

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:25.781
AND I'M REALLY PUZZLED AS TO WHY --

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.883
THEY HAVE CHOSEN -- TO TO

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.751
RETREAT FROM THAT ROLE I THINK

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:30.385
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:33.755
SENSE [inaudible]

01:16:33.822 --> 01:16:35.190
THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.994
AT MR CORD RATE.

01:16:39.061 --> 01:16:42.064
YOU'VE GIVEN US AN OVERVIEW OF A

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.799
NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT THE CFPB

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:47.602
WORKED ON SPECIFICALLY ARE THERE.

01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:50.439
AREAS THAT DESERVED HEIGHTENED

01:16:50.505 --> 01:16:54.609
AWARENESS FOR THE STATE.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:55.777
WELL I THINK THERE'S QUITE A FEW

01:16:55.844 --> 01:16:58.146
AREAS -- I DO THINK THAT STUDENT

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:00.315
LOAN SERVICING IS AN AREA OF

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:01.817
HEIGHTENED PORTS FOR THE STATE'S

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.151
I THINK SMALL DOLLAR LENDING IS

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:04.987
AN AREA OF HIGH IMPORTANCE FOR

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:05.687
THE STATE'S.

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.656
I THINK DEBT COLLECTION IS AN

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:08.256
AREA OF HEIGHTENED IMPORTANCE

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.424
FOR THE STATE'S.

01:17:09.491 --> 01:17:10.258
THERE'S SEVENTY MILLION

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:11.727
AMERICANS AND IF YOU BREAK THAT

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.295
DOWN FOR CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.364
PROBABLY -- EIGHT OR TEN MILLION

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:16.932
CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT HAVE A

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.667
DEBT OUTSTANDING AND COLLECTION

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.135
IN ANYTIME OR SUPPOSEDLY

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:22.004
SOMETIMES THOSE ARE WRONG THEY

01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:23.038
ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY -- THAT

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:25.273
DEBT WHERE THE NUMBER NUMBERS

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:25.874
THAT ARE BEING QUOTED IN THEM

01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:26.975
ARE WRONG.

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.510
AND YET THEY CAN BE SUBJECT TO A

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:31.747
GREAT DEAL OF HARASSMENT MUCH OF

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:32.514
WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW BUT

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.716
DEBT COLLECTORS ARE VERY --

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:37.519
AGGRESSIVE AT TIMES AND THEY

01:17:37.586 --> 01:17:38.453
WILL VIOLATE THE LINE OF PEOPLE

01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.488
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROTECT

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:40.589
THEMSELVES IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:42.090
SITUATION FOR THEM SO I THINK

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.792
THAT COLLECTIONS ANOTHER AREA

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:46.094
WHERE THE STATE'S COULD DO MORE --

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:47.462
I THINK SOME OF THE ENFORCEMENT

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.831
OF THE MORTGAGE LAWS -- AT THE

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.800
STATE LEVEL -- THE REAL ESTATE

01:17:51.867 --> 01:17:53.969
SETTLEMENT PRACTICES ACT IS VERY

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.771
HIT OR MISS IN TERMS OF HOW WELL

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:56.972
THAT'S ENFORCED.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:17:59.708
AT THE STATE LEVEL UP SO THERE'S

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:00.976
THERE'S A VARIETY OF PLACES

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:02.177
WHERE I THINK STATES.

01:18:02.244 --> 01:18:03.879
THAT COULD BE MORE BUT I THINK

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.247
THAT.

01:18:05.313 --> 01:18:06.948
RATHER THAN ME TRYING TO GUESS

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.550
AT WHAT THOSE ARE.

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.552
IF YOU HAD A CALIFORNIA UNIT

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.254
THAT WAS FOCUS VERY SPECIFIC ON

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.855
THIS ISSUE AND THEY WERE HEARING

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.657
FROM CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT EXACTLY

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.658
WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS THEY WERE

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.260
FACING IN THEIR LIVES.

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:19.561
THEN I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE A

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.563
VERY GOOD FINGER ON THE PULSE OF

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.131
HOW THEY COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:24.699
IN PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S

01:18:24.766 --> 01:18:26.234
LOOKING OUT FOR THEM.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.436
THANK YOU.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:28.570
NOW THERE'S A TOPIC WE HAVEN'T

01:18:28.637 --> 01:18:30.072
REALLY TALKED ABOUT BUT A TOPIC

01:18:30.138 --> 01:18:32.040
THAT'S EMERGING -- EMERGING HERE

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.141
IN.

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:33.909
NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:36.078
REALLY IT ACROSS THE WORLD IN

01:18:36.144 --> 01:18:39.314
ITS FIN TECH -- CAN YOU.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:41.149
THINK YOU TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.484
ON HOW STATE.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.353
CAN DEAL -- WITH THE EMERGING

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.923
FINTECH SPACE -- PARTICULARLY

01:18:47.989 --> 01:18:49.591
BECAUSE THERE REALLY ARE NO

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.626
LAWLER PRECEDENTS AROUND AND NEW

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.795
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY WHICH CAN

01:18:53.862 --> 01:18:56.298
BE VERY HELPFUL -- BUT CERTAINLY

01:18:56.364 --> 01:18:59.301
WE WE DON'T KNOW AT WHAT

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.936
DIRECTION IT CAN OR WILL GO.

01:19:01.002 --> 01:19:02.237
YEAH I I WOULD SAY THIS IS ONE

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:04.005
OF THE ISSUES I'M NOT SURE WE

01:19:04.072 --> 01:19:06.208
EVER FELT WE FULLY FIGURED OUT --

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.376
CLEARLY WITH THE NEW INNOVATIVE

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:09.478
PROVIDERS YOU WANT TO GIVE THEM

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:11.113
SOME RUNNING ROOM TO SEE IF THEY

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.547
CAN BUILD A BETTER MOUSE TRAP

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:15.584
AND BETTER SERVE CONSUMERS.

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:16.151
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO STIFLE

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.185
INNOVATION.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.420
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALL HAVE

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.155
TO GET LICENSES TO OPERATE AT

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:21.189
SOME POINT IF THEY'RE GOING TO

01:19:21.256 --> 01:19:22.657
ACTUALLY SERVE THE CONSUMER

01:19:22.724 --> 01:19:23.658
PUBLIC.

01:19:23.725 --> 01:19:25.393
AND IT GIVES YOU SOME ABILITY TO

01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.695
SUPERINTEND THEM AND SEE WHAT

01:19:26.761 --> 01:19:29.364
THEY'RE DOING WE TRIED -- TO

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.599
APPROACH THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:31.967
ABOUT REACH WHERE WE WOULD HAVE

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:34.102
SESSIONS BACK AND FORTH AND WE

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:34.703
CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:37.105
DOING -- WE TRIED TO FOCUS THEM

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:40.509
ON CONSUMER FRIENDLY PRACTICES --

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:42.110
BUT YOU KNOW UNLESS SOMEBODY'S

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.112
VIOLATING THE LAW THEY CAN SERVE

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.147
CONSUMERS.

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:46.548
RELATIVELY POORLY OR THEY CAN

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.183
SERVE THEM WELL IT'S REALLY UP

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.885
TO THEM TO COMPETE THAT WAY IN

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.653
THE FINANCIAL MARKET PLACE -- IF

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.855
THEY'RE SERVING CONSUMERS BETTER

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:56.057
THEY SHOULD BE DRAWING BUSINESS

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:57.459
TO THEMSELVES THAT'S WHY I THINK.

01:19:57.526 --> 01:19:59.995
A PROGRESSIVE BANKING AN ETHICAL

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.997
OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TEND TO

01:20:02.063 --> 01:20:03.431
WIN OUT IN THE LONG RUN.

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.466
BUT IN THE SHORT RUN THEIR

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:06.735
PRACTICES PEOPLE CAN ENGAGE IN

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.503
THAT CAN GAIN SOME MARKET SHARE

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.971
FOR TIME THEY PROBABLY WON'T WIN

01:20:10.038 --> 01:20:11.373
OUT THE LONG RUN.

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.240
AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THE

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:13.508
REST THE MARKET FOLLOWS HIM IN A

01:20:13.575 --> 01:20:14.910
RACE TO THE BOTTOM THAT HAPPENED

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.012
WITH MORTGAGE LENDING AND IT LED

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.781
TO THE FINANCIAL CRISIS -- BUT

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:21.917
IN TERMS OF FINTECH -- I'VE SEEN

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.152
A LOT OF FINTECH PROVIDERS THAT

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.021
I THINK ARE CONSUMER FRIENDLY

01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:27.689
AND THEY ARE COMING UP WITH WAYS

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:28.557
TO PROVIDE.

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:30.091
MORE SPEED AND EASE AND

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:31.593
CONVENIENCE FOR CONSUMERS.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:32.427
I WANT THEM TO HAVE SOME

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:34.196
LATITUDE TO PURSUE THOSE THINGS

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:35.497
AND SEE IF THEY CAN IMPROVE THE

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.498
MARKET PLACE.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.166
ON THEIR OWN AND I DON'T WANT

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:40.235
THEM TO BE OVERSHADOWED BY TOO

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.937
MUCH OVERHANG OF GOVERNMENT

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.939
REGULATIONS -- IF THEY'RE

01:20:44.005 --> 01:20:46.741
UNCLEAR OR IF THEY'RE CONFUSING

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.009
UP BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE TO

01:20:48.076 --> 01:20:49.077
COMPLY WITH THE LAW LIKE

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.579
EVERYBODY ELSE NOBODY SHOULD BE

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:52.013
ABLE TO WIN IN THE MARKETPLACE

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.381
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME.

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:54.849
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS AS EVERYBODY

01:20:54.916 --> 01:20:59.120
ELSE THEY SHOULD BE ON A LEVEL

01:20:59.187 --> 01:20:59.654
PLAYING FIELD.

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:00.322
THANK YOU AND I'D LIKE TO THANK

01:21:00.388 --> 01:21:01.790
YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:02.991
IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:05.093
IN THINKING THROUGH I KNOW THAT

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.429
YOU'RE AN INDIVIDUAL -- WHO HAD

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:08.763
THE CAPACITY WORKING WITH BOTH

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:11.533
RED AND BLUE STATES -- AND

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.934
THEY'RE AT THIS AT WHAT I'VE

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.536
LEARNED FROM BEING IN THE IN THE

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:16.171
SPACES THAT IT'S NOT A PARTISAN

01:21:16.238 --> 01:21:19.274
ISSUE -- THAT FINANCIAL SERVICES --

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:20.775
ARE ISSUES THAT IMPACT AS YOU

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:23.211
SAID CONSUMERS -- AND THAT IS IT

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:25.513
REALLY THE GOAL HERE AND HOW WE

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.816
PROTECT CONSUMERS ON HOW WE

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:30.085
ENSURE CONSUMERS -- ARE ABLE TO

01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:31.486
LIVE IN OUR STATE TO IN OUR IN

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:33.255
OUR COUNTRY IN A WAY -- THROUGH

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.456
FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT IS

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:36.224
RESPONSIBLE IN A WAY THAT HELPS

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:37.626
THEM GET TO THEIR GOAL AS

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.261
OPPOSED TO INHIBITING THEM AND

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.862
MAKING THE IMPACT OR

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:42.831
CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THESE

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:45.233
NEGATIVE PRODUCTS -- GREATER --

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.668
AND IN REALLY INHIBITS THEY'RE

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.770
MOVING FORWARD AT SO THANK YOU

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:51.239
VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE FOR

01:21:51.306 --> 01:21:53.241
YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR YOUR

01:21:53.308 --> 01:21:53.908
FEEDBACK AN INSIGHT.

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:55.243
OKAY I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:56.177
MORE IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID I

01:21:56.244 --> 01:21:57.646

SIMILAR KINDS OF CREDIT AND I'M

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:20.822

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.657
BIT HISTORY AND BACKGROUND ABOUT

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.925
THE PAYDAY LENDING INDUSTRY.

TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT

01:24:27.996 --> 01:24:30.231
CALIFORNIA MY TO TO TRY AND

IMPROVE THAT MARKET PLACE.

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.334
SO FIRST OFF ON HISTORY IF I

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:34.636
COULD I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH TWO

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:36.137
QUICK STATISTICS THAT I THINK

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.705
WILL HELP SET THE TABLE AND HELP

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:38.640
YOU UNDERSTAND.

01:24:38.706 --> 01:24:40.275
THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN THAT

01:24:40.341 --> 01:24:42.277
MARKET PLACE THE FIRST TO TO

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.145
STICK IS THE AVERAGE INTEREST

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:45.847
RATE OF THE NEW YORK CITY LE

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.849
COSA NOSTRA LOAN SHARKING

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:49.284
SYNDICATES THE ORGANIZED CRIME

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.286
FAMILIES AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.921
POWER IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:53.955
THEIR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:57.292
WERE TWO HUNDRED AND 50% VERY

01:24:57.358 --> 01:24:59.694
EXPENSIVE LOANS HISTORICALLY --

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.996
BUT THE SECOND STATISTIC IS THE

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:04.132
AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON PAYDAY

01:25:04.199 --> 01:25:06.201
LOANS AT STOREFRONT LOCATIONS

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.902
ALL ACROSS AMERICA.

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:09.637
TODAY AND THAT AVERAGE INTEREST

01:25:09.704 --> 01:25:12.907
RATE IS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.175
2410025% SO NEARLY TWICE AS

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:19.280
EXPENSIVE AS THE MOB CHARGED.

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:19.948
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:21.182
FACT THAT'S HARD TO HIDE FROM NO

01:25:21.249 --> 01:25:22.784
MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE AISLE NO

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:24.319
MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:25.620
AND I THINK IT HISTORICALLY IF

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:26.988
YOU GO BACK TO THE EARLIEST

01:25:27.055 --> 01:25:29.357
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR REPUBLIC ALL

01:25:29.424 --> 01:25:31.125

RETURNED TO STATES THAT HAD

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:44.372
INTEREST RATE CAPS.

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:46.307
THEY WERE VERY LOW BY TODAY'S

01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:48.810
STANDARDS THEY RANGE FROM 5% TO

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:51.346
UP AROUND NINE OR 10% 6% WAS THE

01:25:51.412 --> 01:25:53.414
NORM BACK THEN AT THE FOUNDING

01:25:53.481 --> 01:25:54.582
OF OUR REPUBLIC.

01:25:54.649 --> 01:25:56.551
FREEDOM BACK IF THE FOUNDING OF

01:25:56.618 --> 01:25:58.286
OUR REPUBLIC DID NOT MEAN THAT

01:25:58.353 --> 01:25:59.754
YOU COULD CHARGE ANY INTEREST

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.289
RATE YOU WANT TO POOR PEOPLE

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:07.829
KIND OF LOANS THEY BANNED THEM

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:09.697
OUT RIGHT WITH VERY LOW INTEREST

01:26:09.764 --> 01:26:12.133
RATE CAPS WELL AS TIME WENT ON

01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:13.501
ALL STATES HAD INTEREST RATE

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:15.236
CAPS THROUGHOUT THE EARLY PERIOD

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:16.571
OF THE REPUBLIC IN THE BEGINNING

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:17.505
THE TWENTY CENTURY BE STARTED

01:26:17.572 --> 01:26:18.940
REFORM OUR CONSUMER FINANCIAL

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.241

01:26:20.308 --> 01:26:22.110
BY ALLOWING HIGHER INTEREST

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:23.177
RATES IN WHAT WERE CALLED

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.779
SPECIAL USE REALIZE AND THEY

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.080
INCREASED INTEREST RATES

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:26.814
TYPICALLY IN THE TWENTIETH

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:29.317
CENTURY SO BETWEEN EIGHTEEN TO

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:32.387
AS HIGH AS 42% BUT 36% WAS.

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:33.655
USUALLY SEEN AS THE UPPER

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:37.158
BOUNDARY THROUGHOUT THE VAST

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:37.926
MAJORITY OF THE TWENTY CENTURY.

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.394
SO THE GREATEST GENERATION SO

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:40.762
CALLED GREATEST GENERATION THAT

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:41.963
WENT AND SURVIVE THE GREAT

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.231
DEPRESSION AND FOUGHT THE SECOND

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.934
WORLD WAR -- IN JAPAN GERMANY

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.902
THEY ALL CAME HOME AND THEY HAD

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.404
INTEREST RATE CAPS THE

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.672
PROHIBITED.

A PAYDAY LOANS VEHICLE TITLE

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.542
LOANS BUT THEN LATER ON ABOUT

01:26:54.609 --> 01:26:55.810
TWENTY FIVE OR THIRTY YEARS AGO

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:57.645
THINGS STARTED TO CHANGE A SMALL

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.280
DOLLAR LANDINGS TO INDUSTRY A

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:00.281
MERGE THAT SAID THEY WERE GONNA

JUST HOLDING ONTO A CASHING A

01:27:18.232 --> 01:27:18.900
CHECK.

01:27:18.967 --> 01:27:20.168
RETURNED OUT THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:27:20.234 --> 01:27:22.203
SHORT TERM LOANS EVERY STUDY

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:23.338

SPONSORED STUDIES ACADEMIC

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.508
STUDIES AND ALSO EVENTUALLY THE

CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:30.778
BUREAU WHICH I HAD THE ABILITY

01:27:30.845 --> 01:27:32.513
TO GET MORE DATA ON THIS THAN.

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:34.215
EVER BEFORE LITERALLY IN THE

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.150
HISTORY OF THE PLANET FOUND THAT

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:37.151
THESE LOANS ARE NOT SHORT TERM

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.386
LOANS THAT IN FACT THEY GET

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:40.922
ROLLED OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN AND

ACTUALLY BARS ABOUT TEN TIMES

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:44.993

01:27:45.059 --> 01:27:46.828
AND PAYS BACK NEARLY THE SAME

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:48.196

THEY EVEN START MAKING A

01:27:49.998 --> 01:27:50.932
PROGRESS ON THE PRINCIPAL

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.433
BALANCE.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.401
AND THE INTEREST RATES ON THESE

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:55.903
LOANS ARE TRULY EXTRAORDINARY I

01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:57.372
WISH I COULD SHARE WITH YOU SOME

01:27:57.438 --> 01:27:58.673
OF THE SUFFERING THAT I'VE SEEN

01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.308
IN MY OWN WORK AS AN EXPERT

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.213
COUNTRY.

01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:07.515
THE SINGLE MOMS THAT WEEP ON THE

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.283
STAND WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT HOW

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:10.818
THEY CAN'T PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:12.420
BECAUSE THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.822
JUST MAKE INTEREST PAYMENTS.

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:16.157
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE

01:28:16.224 --> 01:28:18.493

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.965
TIME DOING IT BECAUSE WELL BUT

01:28:24.032 --> 01:28:25.533
BECAUSE THEIR SERVICING A LONG

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.736
TERM 41005100% INTEREST RATE

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:29.470
LOAN.

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:30.772
HI BEASTLY THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:32.440
YOU AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT THE

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:34.375
EMERGING SOCIAL SCIENTIFIC

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:35.943
EVIDENCE AS MORE AND MORE

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:37.712
EVIDENCE IS COMING BACK IN STUDY

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:39.013
AFTER STUDY SUGGESTING THAT

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.214
PAYDAY LOANS.

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:42.250
ARE ON HEALTHY FOR YOU THE CAUSE

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:44.552
STRESS THEY CAUSE ANXIETY IN

01:28:44.619 --> 01:28:46.020
FACT A UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:48.122
STORY A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.624
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO.

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:52.126
LOOKED AT SUICIDE DATA IN

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.429
HOSPITALS WHERE IN COMPARED

01:28:54.495 --> 01:28:56.898
SUICIDE REPORTS WHERE IN IN

01:28:56.964 --> 01:28:58.099
LOCATIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAD

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.034
ACCESS TO PAY LOANS AND PLACES

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.235
WHERE THEY DIDN'T.

01:29:01.302 --> 01:29:02.336
AND THEY FOUND A SIGNIFICANT

01:29:02.403 --> 01:29:04.706
CAUSAL CORRELATION BETWEEN FIRST

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.474
TIME PAYDAY LOAN USE AN

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:07.909
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:08.843
IT MAKES A LOT OF COMMON SENSE

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:14.082
DOESN'T IT IF YOU'RE A SINGLE

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:15.249
MOM MARKETS SUCTION WORKER AND

01:29:15.316 --> 01:29:15.883
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:16.517
ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE IT THE ENDS

01:29:16.584 --> 01:29:17.085
MEET AT THAT THE END OF THE

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:17.318
MONTH.

01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:17.885
IT'S EASY TO START FEELING

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.721
HOPELESS AND TO GIVE UP AND

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:20.888
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TOO

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.323
MANY AMERICANS ALL ACROSS OUR

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:22.990
COUNTRY.

01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:24.592
LET ME TELL YOU NOW SECOND ABOUT

01:29:24.659 --> 01:29:25.827
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE C. F. P.

01:29:25.893 --> 01:29:27.929
BEES WORK ON CONSUMER ON ON A

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:30.064
HIGH COST LANDING.

01:29:30.131 --> 01:29:31.399
INSTRUCTOR CORDRAY SAID.

01:29:31.466 --> 01:29:33.101
THE CFPB DID NOT HAVE THE

01:29:33.167 --> 01:29:33.901
AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT IN

01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:35.503
STRAIGHT CAP CONGRESS DID NOT

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:37.205
PROVIDE FOR THAT BUT WHAT IT DID

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:38.840
SAY WAS THAT THE CFPB WAS

01:29:38.906 --> 01:29:41.242
LEGALLY ENTITLED TO IDENTIFY AND

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:42.376
DEFINE AND PROHIBIT.

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:44.245
UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.647
PRACTICES AND SO WHILE I WAS AT

01:29:46.714 --> 01:29:48.549
THE CFPB DIRECTOR CORDRAY LED AN

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.251
EFFORT TO DO THE MOST

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.720
COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH AND STUDY

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:54.255
OF PAYDAY LENDING IN THE HISTORY

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:55.156
OF OUR COUNTRY.

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.792
WE DID STUDY AFTER STUDY WE

01:29:57.859 --> 01:29:59.527
ACTED CONSULTATIONS WITH SMALL

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.395
BUSINESSES WITH FAITH LEADERS

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.765
WITH THE MILITARY WITH -- THE

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:04.799
EXECUTIVES WITH TRADE

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:07.235
ASSOCIATIONS FOR INDUSTRY WE

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.570
HELD HEARINGS AND WE EVENTUALLY

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.538
DID A NOTICE AND COMMENT

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:12.373
RULEMAKING WERE OVER A MILLION

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.442
AMERICANS WAITING EMPHATICALLY

01:30:14.509 --> 01:30:16.244
ABOUT THE VERY ISSUES NOT

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:18.412
EVERYBODY AGREED BUT ULTIMATELY.

01:30:18.479 --> 01:30:19.514
UNDER DIRECTOR CORDRAY AS

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.215
LEADERSHIP THE CFPB CAME UP WITH

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.751
A COMPROMISE PROPOSAL IT'S A

01:30:23.818 --> 01:30:25.987
COMPLICATED REGULATION -- BUT AT

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:30.291
ITS CORE IT HAS A SIMPLE IDEA

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:31.392
AND THE IDEA IS THIS.

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:32.360
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A TRIPLE

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:32.960
DIGIT INTEREST RATE LOAN YOU

01:30:33.027 --> 01:30:33.861
SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK WHETHER

01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.096
NOT THAT BORROWER HAS THE

01:30:35.163 --> 01:30:36.898
ABILITY TO REPAY THE DEBT%

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:37.598
INCLUDING THEIR OTHER PRE

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.801
EXISTING OBLIGATIONS AND MAKE

01:30:39.867 --> 01:30:41.369
THEIR NECESSARY EXPENSES.

01:30:41.435 --> 01:30:42.937
I PERSONALLY HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:43.838
THAT SATISFIED WITH THE

01:30:43.905 --> 01:30:45.006
REGULATION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK

01:30:45.072 --> 01:30:45.807
IT WENT FAR ENOUGH I THINK

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:47.708
THERE'S SOME LOOPHOLES AND I

01:30:47.775 --> 01:30:50.044
THINK THAT -- WE HAVE TIME

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.078
TESTED LAWS THAT HAVE WORK

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:53.681
BETTER BUT IT WAS I THINK A VERY

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:55.516
REASONABLE PROPOSAL UNDER THE

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:56.684
CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS A

01:30:56.751 --> 01:30:58.219
COMPROMISE PROPOSAL THAT ALLOW

01:30:58.286 --> 01:31:00.688
PAYDAY LENDING TO CONTINUE EXIST.

01:31:00.755 --> 01:31:04.225
BUT ALSO A WOOD BAT CHOIR PSALM.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:05.626
GUIDE RAILS TO TRY AND TEMPER

01:31:05.693 --> 01:31:07.528
SOME OF THE WORST EFFECTS WELL

01:31:07.595 --> 01:31:09.063
THE INDUSTRY IMMEDIATELY SU THE

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:09.964
CFPB.

01:31:10.031 --> 01:31:11.098
GOTTEN JUNCTION AND AS SOON AS

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:12.533
THE ADMINISTRATION CHANGED

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.135
THEY'VE NOW DECIDED TO ROLL BACK

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.037
THAT PROPOSAL BEFORE IT EVER

01:31:16.103 --> 01:31:17.605
LEAVES THE CRAB COMPLIANCE WAS

01:31:17.672 --> 01:31:18.472
SUPPOSED TO BE REQUIRED IN

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:20.441
AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN BUT

01:31:20.508 --> 01:31:21.742
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THAT

01:31:21.809 --> 01:31:22.810
REGULATIONS NEVER TO SEE THE

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:29.050
LIGHT OF DAY -- AT I'M NOT YOU.

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:31.152
FOR FOR ME.

01:31:31.219 --> 01:31:32.119
I'M NOT I'M IT'S NOT A POLITICS

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:32.753
FOR ME I DON'T REALLY CARE THAT

01:31:32.820 --> 01:31:34.322
MUCH FRANKLY ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:35.389
PARTY'S OR WHATEVER. FOR ME IT'S

01:31:35.456 --> 01:31:35.990
BUT THE SUFFERING SINGLE MOMS

01:31:36.057 --> 01:31:37.358
THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS THE

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.227
PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE TODAY

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:40.761
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO PAY BACK

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.597
THEIR 5100% INTEREST RATE LOANS

01:31:42.663 --> 01:31:43.831
AND NOT MAKING IT TO THE END OF

01:31:43.898 --> 01:31:44.131
THE MONTH.

01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:44.999
AND THE COLLECTING THEIR

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:46.067
CHILDREN AND THEIR OTHER

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:47.969
OBLIGATIONS BECAUSE OF THE

01:31:48.035 --> 01:31:49.871
PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT WORKING

01:31:49.937 --> 01:31:50.471
FOR THEM.

01:31:50.538 --> 01:31:52.039
WELL ALRIGHT SO THAT'S A A

01:31:52.106 --> 01:31:53.274
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CFPB IS

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:55.076
WORK AND LAST I'D LIKE TO TALK

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:58.179
ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA MY TO

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.448
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M FROM A FROM

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.082

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:01.616

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.952
FAMILY ON MY ON MY MY ANCESTORS

REPUBLICANS.

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:08.990
AND I GUESS I'M A REASONABLY

01:32:09.056 --> 01:32:10.725
CONSERVATIVE GUY AS WELL BUT I

01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.460
WILL SAY THAT GROWING UP OVER

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:13.828
THE KNEE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:14.428
THE MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS THE

01:32:14.495 --> 01:32:15.129
DESERT.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:16.597
I ALWAYS LOOKED UP TO CALIFORNIA

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.966
IS A BRIGHT AND SHINING LEADER.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:21.669
IN THE COUNTRY EIGHT YOU KNOW A

BUT BUT I LOOKED UP TO SAN

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:31.846
FRANCISCO IN THE SACRAMENTO THE

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.915
NEXT BIG METROPOLITAN AREA OVER

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.850

DISLOCATED THEIR COPIES THE

01:32:50.064 --> 01:32:51.632
COBBLED THEIR COMPROMISES -- YOU

HUNDRED DOLLARS IN YOUR PAYDAY

LOANS ARE NEARLY AS BAD AS THEY

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:59.106
ARE IN MY HOME STATE OF UTAH.

01:32:59.173 --> 01:33:00.508

YOUR TESTIMONY AND REALLY YOU

01:34:24.925 --> 01:34:26.894
HAVE ACTUALLY THROWN ME OFF BY

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:28.729
YOUR ADMIRATION.

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.131
I I DO FIRST WHY NEED A

01:34:30.197 --> 01:34:31.499
CLARIFICATION FROM YOU AND THIS

01:34:31.565 --> 01:34:34.468
MAY BE MORE A FAULT OF MINE.

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.137
YOU'RE YOU'RE USING THE TERM

01:34:36.203 --> 01:34:38.806
PAYDAY LOANS -- OFTEN AND I

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.074
HAVEN'T HEARD MUCH ABOUT SMALL

01:34:40.141 --> 01:34:41.409
DOLLAR ARE YOU USING THAT

01:34:41.475 --> 01:34:43.611
SYNONYMOUSLY OR ARE ARE YOU

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:45.479
PURPOSING TO ONLY FOCUS ON

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.914
PAYDAY AND NOT SMALL DOLLAR.

01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:48.983
YOU THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:50.684
WAS USING PAYDAY LOANS AND AN A

01:34:50.751 --> 01:34:51.752
COLLOQUIAL TERM USED IN MY

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:53.020
EXPERIENCE.

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.688
THE INDUSTRY THE SMALL DOLLAR

01:34:54.755 --> 01:34:55.623
LENDING INDUSTRY THEY'RE VERY

01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:56.657
PARTICULAR WHEN THEY TALK TO

01:34:56.724 --> 01:34:58.592
LEGISLATORS AND TO LAWYERS AND

01:34:58.659 --> 01:34:59.994
JUDGES ABOUT WHAT THE WORD

01:35:00.061 --> 01:35:01.262
PAYDAY LOAN MEANS BUT WHEN THEY

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:02.463
TALK TO THEIR CUSTOMERS IT'S ALL

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.798
THE SAME THING CORRECT IF YOU

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.099
ADVERTISE ON THE INTERNET

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:06.167
THEY'RE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU.

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:07.902
A PAYDAY INSTALLMENT LOAN AND

01:35:07.968 --> 01:35:09.737
OPEN AND LINE OF CREDIT A LONGER

01:35:09.804 --> 01:35:11.172
DURATION SOME ALONE YOU CAN

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.807
STRUCTURE WHAT I CALL A PAYDAY

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:14.975
LOAN IN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.644
DIFFERENT WAYS -- AND THEY'RE

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:18.079
HAPPY I MEAN I REALLY CARED IN

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:19.480
THE DATE THE KEY THING.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.981
IS TO FOLLOW THE MONEY IT'S THE

01:35:21.048 --> 01:35:22.149
INTEREST RATE AND YOU CAN

01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.584
PRETEND IT'S SOMETHING ELSE BUT

01:35:23.651 --> 01:35:25.786
IT'S NOT THAT'S THE REAL KEY.

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.621
I APPRECIATE THAT AND NOW I'M

01:35:27.688 --> 01:35:29.323
READY TO OFFER MY ADMIRATION TO

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:31.525
YOU -- IF YOU CAN FIX THIS

01:35:31.592 --> 01:35:33.127
PROBLEM.

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.196
AND THAT IS -- THE DISCUSSION

01:35:35.262 --> 01:35:37.765
FROM MUCH OF MY CONCERN.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:39.233
IS HOW DO WE TAKE THE

01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:40.801
UNDERSERVED THAT HAVE BECOME

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.169
VICTIMIZED.

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:44.972
BY THIS PREDATORY LENDING HOW DO

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:46.107
WE TAKE THIS.

01:35:46.173 --> 01:35:47.608
PARTICULAR PART OF OUR COMMUNITY

01:35:47.675 --> 01:35:50.144
AND LIFT THEM OUT OF POVERTY

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.713
WHAT POLICY OR WHAT WHAT MOVE

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:54.949
COULD WE MAKE CONSIDERATIONS WE

01:35:55.015 --> 01:35:56.383
COULD TAKE THAT COULD ACTUALLY

01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:57.518
FACILITATE.

01:35:57.585 --> 01:35:59.687
SOME TYPE OF A PROGRAM OR PLAN

01:35:59.753 --> 01:36:01.455
TO ACTUALLY LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF

01:36:01.522 --> 01:36:03.357
POVERTY RATHER THAN BURY THEM

01:36:03.424 --> 01:36:09.597
DEEPER INTO IT -- WITH THESE

01:36:09.663 --> 01:36:10.731
WITH THIS FINANCIAL POLICY.

01:36:10.798 --> 01:36:11.465
WELL I THINK IT'S A GREAT

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:12.099
QUESTION AND LOOK I I THINK THE

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:12.733
FIRST PLACE THAT USED TO START

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.667
BY LIFTING UP IS JUST TAKING

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:15.136
SOME OF THE TRAPS AWAY.

01:36:15.202 --> 01:36:15.970
YOU KNOW ONE OF THINGS ABOUT OUR

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:18.005
COUNTRY IS WE ARE VERY TOLERANT

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:20.107
OF TRAPS THAT SINK FAMILIES AND

01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:21.709
THAT'S WHAT THESE ARE THESE

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.010
LOANS ARE THEY ARE DEATH TRAPS.

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:25.179
AND THE TIME TESTED MOST

01:36:25.246 --> 01:36:27.448
EFFECTIVE WAY TO GET THE LENDERS

01:36:27.515 --> 01:36:28.616
TO DETERMINE WHEN OUR PEOPLE

01:36:28.682 --> 01:36:29.917
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY IT'S

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:31.185
JUST LIMIT THE PRICES THEY CAN

01:36:31.252 --> 01:36:32.620
CHARGE TO A REASONABLE INTEREST

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:33.587
RATE.

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:34.355
YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:36:34.421 --> 01:36:36.190
DEFENSE IN THE MILITARY LENDING

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:37.324
ACT REGULATIONS.

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:39.493
WE MANAGED TO DRAFT A REGULATION

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.995
THAT CUTS A LINE ACROSS THE

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:43.230
ENTIRE ECONOMY IN ALL OF THE

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.065
CREDIT CARDS THAT ARE WIDELY

01:36:45.132 --> 01:36:46.200
AVAILABLE.

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:47.635
THOSE ARE STILL AVAILABLE THERE

01:36:47.701 --> 01:36:49.470
WERE NO ADD ROLES ARE KERNELS

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:50.938
ARE GENERAL'S IT CAME YELLING AT

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.273
IS THAT WAIT A MINUTE YOU TOOK

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:53.174
AWAY MY CREDIT CARD.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.475
THERE'S STILL TONS OF CREDIT

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.977
THAT'S OUT THERE -- I IF I COULD

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:57.978
TO YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS MYTH

01:36:58.045 --> 01:37:00.447
OUT THERE THAT WE DON'T HAVE

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:03.117
ACCESS TO CREDIT BECAUSE IF WE

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.285
DON'T HAVE PAYDAY LOANS BUT THE

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:05.286
TRUTH IS.

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:07.221
EVERY CREDIT CARD IN AMERICA HAS

01:37:07.288 --> 01:37:09.490
A BUILT IN FREE PAYDAY LOAN IF

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:11.325
YOU'RE NOT CARRYING A MONTHLY

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:13.861
BALANCE THEN THERE'S A TWENTY

01:37:13.928 --> 01:37:15.396
ONE THREE DAY THREE WEEK --

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:17.398
GRACE PERIOD THAT IS THE SAME

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:19.400
THING IS A PAYDAY LOAN AND YOU

01:37:19.466 --> 01:37:21.035
HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.336
OF COURSE THE PROMISE THE PEOPLE

01:37:22.403 --> 01:37:24.305
GET IN OVER THEIR HEAD.

01:37:24.371 --> 01:37:25.773
IN AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA START

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.374
CARING A REVOLVING BALANCE AND

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:28.742
THEN THEY START YOU KNOW GETTING

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:30.311
FURTHER FURTHER BEHIND BUT THE

01:37:30.377 --> 01:37:32.346
SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM IS NOT

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:34.114
DUMPING ANOTHER 4100% STRAIGHT

01:37:34.181 --> 01:37:35.182
LOAN ON THEM THE PROBLEM THE

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.850
SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM.

01:37:36.917 --> 01:37:37.851
IS TRYING TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF

01:37:37.918 --> 01:37:38.752
PULL YOURSELF UP BY THE

01:37:38.819 --> 01:37:40.354
BOOTSTRAPS AND HAVE SOME OF THAT

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.323
CALIFORNIA ENTREPRENEURIAL

01:37:42.389 --> 01:37:42.723
SPIRIT.

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:43.390
SO.

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.592
I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:45.993
THAT CAN BE DONE TO ALLEVIATE

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:47.962
POVERTY AND I DON'T MEAN TO SAY

01:37:48.028 --> 01:37:49.797
THAT AN INTEREST RATE CAP IS THE

01:37:49.863 --> 01:37:50.598
ONLY THING.

01:37:50.664 --> 01:37:56.170
BUT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE VERY

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.071
MOST IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS.

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:59.206
AS A MEMBER STONE.

01:37:59.273 --> 01:37:59.873
SO THAT PART OF THE SPEAKING OF

01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.109
TRAPS THAT WE FALL INTO HERE AND

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:02.943
AND IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.144
TALK ABOUT THE JURISDICTIONS

01:38:04.211 --> 01:38:06.046
THAT THAT DO IN FACT HAVE CAPS

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:07.214
BECAUSE AS WE'VE TRIED TO PUT

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:08.782
CAPS ON AND EVEN THE SAME.

01:38:08.849 --> 01:38:10.551
AS UNDER THE MILITARY LENDING

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:11.852
ACT WE'RE TOLD.

01:38:11.919 --> 01:38:12.786
OMEGA.

01:38:12.853 --> 01:38:14.888
BY BLENDERS SMALL DOLLAR LENDERS

01:38:14.955 --> 01:38:16.090
PAYDAY LENDERS HOWEVER YOU WANT

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:17.391
TO FRAME IT IT IT'S INTERESTING

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:18.192
THAT YOU DON'T DRAW THAT

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:18.926
DISTINCTION.

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:20.494
BECAUSE WE WE WE PARTS THOSE

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:22.596
WORDS VERY CAREFULLY AROUND HERE

01:38:22.663 --> 01:38:24.365
UNFORTUNATELY.

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:24.932
WE'RE TOLD THAT ALL MY GOSH

01:38:24.999 --> 01:38:25.499
THESE PRODUCTS WILL NOT BE

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:27.735
AVAILABLE AND THE POOREST AMONG

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.637
OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:31.972
WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:34.475
AND I YOUR ENTHUSIASM IN THIS

01:38:34.541 --> 01:38:35.576
NOTION OF SORT OF PULL YOURSELF

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.711
UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS BUT FOR

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:38.178
MANY OF THE POOREST IN

01:38:38.245 --> 01:38:39.446
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:41.615
THERE'S NO ABILITY TO DO THAT

01:38:41.682 --> 01:38:43.384
BECAUSE THEY DON'T.

01:38:43.450 --> 01:38:45.319
THEY DON'T SEE THE LIGHT THEY

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:47.288
DON'T SEE THE ABILITY OUT OF IT.

01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:49.390
AND A LOT OF THEM ARE MAXED OUT

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:50.524
ON THE CREDIT CARDS WHICH IS

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:51.959
WHEN THEY BECOME VULNERABLE TO

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:53.861
TODAY PAYDAY LENDERS.

01:38:53.927 --> 01:38:54.895
AND SO IF.

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.397
A JURISDICTION LIKE NEW YORK AND

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:59.033
PUT A CAP ON AND THEY OBVIOUSLY

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:01.001
THERE POOREST HAVE ACCESS TO

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.002
CAPITAL.

01:39:02.069 --> 01:39:04.538
HOW IN THE WORLD DO THEY DO THAT?

01:39:04.605 --> 01:39:06.240
WHEN OBVIOUS WHEN WE'RE TOLD WE

01:39:06.307 --> 01:39:08.742
CAN'T DO THAT AND STILL GIVE

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:09.310
THESE COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:10.644
CAPITAL?

01:39:10.711 --> 01:39:11.211
WHAT?

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:12.746

LOWEST CREDIT SCORES.

STATES BUT YOUR STATE IS VERY

01:41:15.836 --> 01:41:16.837
RICH IN THESE OPPORTUNITIES IF

YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:37.624
PAWN SHOPS THEY HAVE SOME ROUGH

01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.826
LOANS ARE SOME DRAWBACKS.

01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:40.394
BUT FRANKLY PAWN SHOPS HAVE BEEN

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.762
AROUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS

01:41:41.829 --> 01:41:43.096

LENDER OF LAST RESORT -- TIME

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:46.500
AND TIME AGAIN WHY BECAUSE IN A

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:48.735
PAWN SHOP LOAN YOU PRE PLAN YOUR

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:51.538
OWN EXIT STRATEGY FROM THE DEBT

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:52.072
BY.

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:52.806
TAKING SOME COLLATERAL WHETHER

01:41:52.873 --> 01:41:54.274
THAT'S AN ITEM OF JEWELRY

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:55.876
ELECTRONICS AND PLEDGING

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:57.611

01:42:01.248 --> 01:42:02.716
THAT SHOWS WHAT YOUR EXIT

01:42:02.783 --> 01:42:03.984
STRATEGY WAS.

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.519
YOU'RE ALSO FORCED TO DISCIPLINE

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:07.087
YOURSELF BY MAYBE TAKING A

01:42:07.154 --> 01:42:08.522
LITTLE BIT SMALLER LOAN.

01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:10.424
AND BUY ALSO HAVING A LITTLE BIT

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:11.892

EASY MONEY UP FRONT.

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:17.865
AND PAWN SHOPS EXIST EVERYWHERE

01:42:17.931 --> 01:42:19.933
THERE ARE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.134
PAWN SHOPS THERE BALLOTS ACROSS

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:23.103
AMERICA AND THEY PROVIDE A MUCH

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.671
SAFER MORE REASONABLE

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:26.240
ALTERNATIVE TO PAYDAY LOANS SO

01:42:26.306 --> 01:42:28.342
THAT'S ONLY SIX AM EXAMPLES BUT

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:30.344
I THINK I'VE GONE ON TOO LONG SO

01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:31.545
TO STOP A PROBABLY.

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:32.846
FAKE MORE AT LIVE CREATE THAT IN

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.982
AND THEY THE DIFFICULT THING IS

01:42:35.048 --> 01:42:35.549
FOR US TO CONVINCE OURSELVES

01:42:35.616 --> 01:42:38.919
THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS TO

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:40.153
GET CAPITAL.

01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:41.221
EVEN IF THERE ARE SOME BY

01:42:41.288 --> 01:42:43.724
CREATING AT A CAP LIKE THE 36%

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.559
AND THEN THAT DOES NOT MAKE.

01:42:45.626 --> 01:42:47.761
CERTAIN OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:49.596
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS WE

01:42:49.663 --> 01:42:50.664
CAN LIVE THROUGH IT AND THE

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.366
OTHER ASPECT THAT I VERY MUCH

APPRECIATE AND THAT WE GIVE CUT

01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.569
SHORT SHRIFT TO IS THIS NOTION

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.004
OF FINANCIAL LITERACY.

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.372

01:42:58.438 --> 01:43:00.741

AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN WE DO

01:43:07.548 --> 01:43:10.017
THAT WE ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL

01:43:10.083 --> 01:43:12.419
STRESSORS OUT OF THOSE FAMILIES

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:14.655

THOSE PRESSURES AND THIS IS

01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:24.298
EXACTLY WHY CALIFORNIA PASSED AN

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:25.399
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT.

01:43:25.465 --> 01:43:26.867

TREE AKTION.

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.512
AND THE THE FIRST PERSON THE

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:26.913
FIRST COMPANY THAT GETS THE BID

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:27.681
ON THE LEAD.

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:28.949
PAYS THE HIGHEST AMOUNT FOR

01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:30.417
FIRST LOOK LEAD AND IF YOU

REASONABLE LOAN APPLICATIONS

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.325
LONG BEFORE SOMEBODY EXCUSE ME

01:46:38.391 --> 01:46:40.260
THAT -- YOU KNOW HAS IS ONLY

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:42.362
CHARGING 28% COULD EVER BY A

01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:43.764
POLICE AND SO THEY MANAGE TO

01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:45.398
DOMINATE THE MARKET NOT TO PRICE

01:46:45.465 --> 01:46:47.467
COMPETITION BUT THROUGH MUCH

01:46:47.534 --> 01:46:48.935
MORE AGGRESSIVE SALIENT

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:56.777
ADVERTISING AND MARKETING.

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:57.344
AND MANY OF THE CONSUMERS IN

01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:59.012
THIS MY THE PLACE.

01:46:59.079 --> 01:46:59.646
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW

01:46:59.713 --> 01:47:00.280
EXACTLY WHAT THE PRICES MEAN

01:47:00.347 --> 01:47:00.914
DON'T REALLY READ THE CONTRACTS

01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:01.581
AND HAVE A HARD TIME IDENTIFYING

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:02.115
WHICH COMPANIES ACTUALLY

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:02.816
CHARGING A BETTER INTEREST RATE.

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:03.383
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE FIRST

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:05.819
REASON THE SECOND REASON IS THAT

01:47:05.886 --> 01:47:07.387
PEOPLE GET STUCK ON THESE LOANS

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:08.488

THERE THERE ARE SOME

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:24.471
RESTRICTIONS TO TRY TO PREVENT

THEM TO OFFER SOMETHING THAT WAS.

01:48:46.253 --> 01:48:48.221
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE ENTICING OR

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:50.090
PEELING AND FINANCIALLY MORE

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:52.292
RESPONSIBILITY CONSUMERS TO SORT

OF YOU KNOW.

01:48:53.994 --> 01:48:55.595
CUT INTO THAT MARKET.

WELL I THAT WAS NOT MY JOB I

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.065
WOULD BEEN DELIGHTED TO DO THAT

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:00.567
BUT I GOT THE TICKET WHERE BUT

01:49:00.634 --> 01:49:01.735
YEAH THE DEPARTMENT.

01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:03.370
I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE THE

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:04.437
THERE DEFINITELY WERE

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:05.906
COMMUNICATIONS THAT WENT ON THAT

01:49:05.972 --> 01:49:08.808
ABOUT THAT SORT OF THING -- BET

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:10.543
IT'S BEEN MY AND MY SENSE IS

01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:11.678
THAT THEY HAVE BORNE FRUIT AND

01:49:11.745 --> 01:49:13.179
AND SO YOU KNOW THAT SOME OF THE

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:15.715
SUBPRIME CREDIT CARDS THAT HAVE

01:49:15.782 --> 01:49:17.484
A SECURITY DEPOSIT ON THEM.

01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:19.052
THOSE ARE VERY COMPETITIVE IN

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:19.986
THE SAME MARKET PLACE FOR THE

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:22.155
SAME OR VERY SIMILAR BORROWERS

01:49:22.222 --> 01:49:24.257
IT IS THE PAYDAY LOAN MARKET.

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:25.425
AND WHAT I'M NOT WHEN WHEN MY

01:49:25.492 --> 01:49:27.193
LITTLE SISTER TO BORROW MONEY ON

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.361
WHERE THE SUBPRIME CREDIT CARDS

01:49:28.428 --> 01:49:29.496
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE PRETTY

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:32.098
ROUGH LOANS IT -- BUT YOU KNOW.

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.500
I MEAN THERE THERE ARE TEN TIMES

01:49:33.566 --> 01:49:35.335
CHEAPER THAN THAT AND YOU KNOW

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:36.870
EVEN MODERATELY PRICED PAYDAY

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:38.138
LOANS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE

01:49:38.204 --> 01:49:40.607
SAME NASTY COLLECTION PRACTICES

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:42.242
AND THAT'S IT SO THERE ARE

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:44.844
BETTER BANK AND CREDIT UNION

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.680
ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE --

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:47.814
THEY CAN'T ADVERTISERS

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.849
AGGRESSIVELY CONSUMERS HAVE TO

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.418
SHOP FOR THEM IN ADVANCE A

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:52.919
LITTLE BIT MORE -- AND THEY'RE

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.788
ALSO PROBABLY LITTLE MORE LIKELY

01:49:54.854 --> 01:49:56.957
TO CUT OFF THE CONSUMER A LITTLE

01:49:57.023 --> 01:49:57.691
BIT QUICKER THAN THE PAYDAY

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:59.225
LENDERS ARE BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S

01:49:59.292 --> 01:50:00.760
WHAT CONSUMERS NEED SOMETIMES

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.462
THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO SAY.

01:50:02.529 --> 01:50:03.596
YOU KNOW WHAT NO YOU EAT YOU

01:50:03.663 --> 01:50:05.398

TO PAY THIS BACK AND WHAT YOU

01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.667

BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY AND

01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:18.678
BORROWING MORE MONEY AT 4100% IS

01:50:18.745 --> 01:50:21.948
NOT GONNA HELP YOU.

ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE

COUNTRY TO TAKE THE CRITICAL

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.494
STEP OF OVERSEEING THE STUDENT

CONSUMERS FACE ACROSS THIS STATE

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:15.135
IN THIS COUNTRY LOOM LARGER.

01:51:15.201 --> 01:51:16.736
THE RISKS MORE SIGNIFICANT THE

HARMS MORE SEVERE THE THREATS

01:51:19.472 --> 01:51:20.907
EVEN FROM THOSE SERVING IN POWER

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:22.175
ARE TANGIBLE.

01:51:22.242 --> 01:51:24.244
AND WITH THAT THE SERIOUSNESS OF

01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:25.879
THIS STATE'S COLLECTIVE RESPONSE

01:51:25.945 --> 01:51:26.880

02:03:32.304 --> 02:03:35.975
OR WHETHER THAT AMERICA IS

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:36.776
RESERVED FOR ONLY A SELECT FEW.

02:03:36.842 --> 02:03:37.843
CONSUMER FINANCE MATTERS BECAUSE

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:39.311
THE AMERICAN DREAM MATTERS TO

02:03:39.378 --> 02:03:40.980
YOUNG PEOPLE TO SERVICE MEMBERS

02:03:41.046 --> 02:03:43.249
TO ALL CONSUMERS TO THE THIRTY

02:03:43.315 --> 02:03:44.750
MILLION ACROSS CALIFORNIA.

02:03:44.817 --> 02:03:46.051
AND THE TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.353
MILLION ACROSS AMERICA.

02:03:47.419 --> 02:03:48.921
THAT IS WHY CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:03:48.988 --> 02:03:50.222
MATTERS AND THAT IS WHY

02:03:50.289 --> 02:03:51.457
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:52.458
MATTERS.

02:03:52.525 --> 02:03:53.726
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU CAN

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:55.227
DO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:56.629
LACKS THE AUTHORITY TO DO.

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:57.863
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN

02:03:57.930 --> 02:03:59.465
PUSH OTHER STATES THE FEDERAL

02:03:59.532 --> 02:04:01.000
GOVERNMENT AND EVERYONE ELSE TO

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:01.901
DO BETTER.

02:04:01.967 --> 02:04:03.269
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN

02:04:03.335 --> 02:04:05.237
STAND UP WHEN THE FEDERAL

02:04:05.304 --> 02:04:06.505
GOVERNMENT FALLS DOWN.

02:04:06.572 --> 02:04:07.039
AND SO AS THIS COMMITTEE

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:08.741
UNDERTAKES THE IMPORTANT AND

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.176
NECESSARY WORK OF CRAFTING A

02:04:10.242 --> 02:04:11.677
CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BEER OUT.

02:04:11.744 --> 02:04:12.645
I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER SOME

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:13.746
OBSERVATIONS THAT I SPELL OUT IN

02:04:13.813 --> 02:04:15.014
MORE DETAIL IN MY WRITTEN

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.649
TESTIMONY.

02:04:16.715 --> 02:04:18.551
FIRST COMPLAINTS ARE A CRITICAL

02:04:18.617 --> 02:04:19.618
COMPONENT OF CONSUMER DRIVEN

02:04:19.685 --> 02:04:21.520
REFORM.

02:04:21.587 --> 02:04:23.222
THE CFPB GAVE POWER TO AMERICAN

02:04:23.289 --> 02:04:25.024
CONSUMERS BY GIVING THEM THE

02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:26.358
ABILITY TO RAISE THEIR HAND AND

02:04:26.425 --> 02:04:27.493
SAY THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.628
OVER A MILLION CONSUMERS WERE

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:30.462
HELP THROUGH THE C. APPEASE

02:04:30.529 --> 02:04:32.031
SEABEES COMPLAIN PORTAL.

02:04:32.097 --> 02:04:34.099
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CFPB

02:04:34.166 --> 02:04:35.634
LOOK AT THOSE MILLION COMPLAINTS

02:04:35.701 --> 02:04:37.436
AND RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE WERE

02:04:37.503 --> 02:04:38.938
NOT ISOLATED INCIDENTS. FOR

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.406
EVERY CONSUMER WHO COMPLAINED

02:04:40.472 --> 02:04:42.708
ABOUT BEING RIPPED OFF TEN MORE

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:44.543
SAT SILENT DESPITE BEING HARMED.

02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:45.945
BUT THROUGH THAT ONE COMPLAINT

02:04:46.011 --> 02:04:48.080
THE CFPB COULD HELP ALL OF THEM.

02:04:48.147 --> 02:04:48.914
FOR SIXTY YEARS THESE COMPLAINTS

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:50.516
WERE THE FOUNDATION OF THE CFPB

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:51.917
IS WORK.

02:04:51.984 --> 02:04:53.185
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BROKEN

02:04:53.252 --> 02:04:53.752
DO MORE THAN REPLICATE THIS

02:04:53.819 --> 02:04:56.088
APPROACH YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON IT.

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:57.790
INSTITUTIONS REGARDLESS OF SIZE

02:04:57.857 --> 02:04:58.891
OR STRUCTURE SHOULD BE

02:04:58.958 --> 02:05:00.593
STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO ENGAGE

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:02.261
IN A ROBUST COMPLAINT RESOLUTION

02:05:02.328 --> 02:05:03.095
PROCESS.

02:05:03.162 --> 02:05:05.331
AND MAKE THE CONSUMERS

02:05:05.397 --> 02:05:05.898
COMPLAINTS PUBLIC.

02:05:05.965 --> 02:05:07.333
SECOND DISTINCT POPULATIONS CAN

02:05:07.399 --> 02:05:09.034
BRING UNIQUE INSIGHT.

02:05:09.101 --> 02:05:10.436
CONSUMER DRIVEN REFORM IS NOT

02:05:10.502 --> 02:05:11.837
LIMITED TO COMPLAINTS THE

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:13.939
DESIGNERS OF THE CFPB REALIZE

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.407
THAT SPECIAL POPULATIONS

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:16.709
INTERACT WITH CONSUMER FINANCIAL

02:05:16.775 --> 02:05:18.244
MARKETS IN UNIQUE WAYS.

02:05:18.310 --> 02:05:19.578
AND WITH THAT OFTEN COMES UNIQUE

02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:21.146
PROBLEMS FROM THE OFFICE FOR

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:22.648
YOUNG CONSUMERS THE OFFICE FOR

SERVICE NUMBER AFFAIRS TO THE

02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:25.251
OFFICE FOR OLDER AMERICANS.

02:05:25.317 --> 02:05:26.652
DEDICATING RESOURCES TO

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:27.987
UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEMS THAT

02:05:28.053 --> 02:05:29.855
EXPERIENCES OF THESE POPULATIONS

02:05:29.922 --> 02:05:32.758
WITH KEY TO THE CFPB SUCCESS.

02:05:32.825 --> 02:05:34.393
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU CAN

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:35.060
DO THE SAME.

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.462
THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:37.029
CAN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:05:37.096 --> 02:05:39.031
UNIQUELY DIVERSE POPULATION OF

02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:40.332
THE STATE A REPRESENTATIVE.

02:05:40.399 --> 02:05:41.667
AND OFFICE FOR NEW AMERICANS IN

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:44.770
OFFICE FOR ROLE AMERICANS AN

02:05:44.837 --> 02:05:45.871
OFFICE FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION.

02:05:45.938 --> 02:05:46.939
THIRD MARKET SHOULD BE DEFINED

02:05:47.006 --> 02:05:48.674
BY WHO NEEDS PROTECTION NOT WHAT

02:05:48.741 --> 02:05:50.476
A PRODUCT IS CALLED OR WHETHER

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.311
AN INSTITUTION TAKE DEPOSITS.

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:53.312
ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

02:05:53.379 --> 02:05:55.381
LESSONS OF THE CRISIS WITH THAT

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:56.982
ALL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

02:05:57.049 --> 02:05:59.051
REGARDLESS OF HOW STRUCTURED

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:00.586
REGARDLESS OF PRODUCT OFFERED.

02:06:00.653 --> 02:06:02.187
NEED ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE

02:06:02.254 --> 02:06:04.556
OVERSIGHT IF WE WISH TO COUNTER

02:06:04.623 --> 02:06:06.959
THE DEEP SEATED INTRINSIC

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:07.559
CONSUMER HARM THAT PLAGUES THE

02:06:07.626 --> 02:06:08.928
MARKET.

02:06:08.994 --> 02:06:09.962
THAT LESSON IS A TRUE NOW IS IT

02:06:10.029 --> 02:06:11.096
IS WAS THAT.

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.798
CONSUMERS FINANCIAL LIVES DO NOT

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:14.733
FIT NEATLY INTO CATEGORIES LIKE

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:15.935
BANK AND NON BANK.

02:06:16.001 --> 02:06:18.003
NOR CONSUMERS LIES ORGANIZED BY

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:18.737
THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THEY ARE

02:06:18.804 --> 02:06:19.605
USING.

02:06:19.672 --> 02:06:20.940
ANY MEANINGFUL EFFORT TO

02:06:21.006 --> 02:06:22.508
SYSTEMICALLY REFORM THE CONSUMER

02:06:22.574 --> 02:06:25.110
FINANCE MARKET MUST NECESSARILY

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:26.512
SHARE THIS PERSPECTIVE.

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:28.147
FOURTH BY CONSOLIDATING ALL

02:06:28.213 --> 02:06:29.515
CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS UNDER

02:06:29.581 --> 02:06:31.350
ONE ROOF ONE AGENCY HAS THE

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:33.252
AUTHORITY AND ONE AGENCY HAS THE

02:06:33.319 --> 02:06:35.054
ACCOUNTABILITY. ONE OF THE MOST

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.422
POWERFUL THINGS THE DODD FRANK

02:06:36.488 --> 02:06:37.923
ACT DID WAS TO CONSOLIDATE THE

02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:40.159
MOST ESSENTIAL CONSUMER

02:06:40.225 --> 02:06:41.660
PROTECTION LAWS UNDER ONE ROOF.

02:06:41.727 --> 02:06:42.861
THE TRUTH IN LENDING ACT TO THE

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:44.363
EQUAL CREDIT OPPORTUNITY ACT FOR

02:06:44.430 --> 02:06:45.297
THE DAY ARE COULD THE FAIR DEBT

02:06:45.364 --> 02:06:46.899
COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT TO THE

02:06:46.966 --> 02:06:48.567
FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT.

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:50.169
THE CFPB HAD A RANGE OF

02:06:50.235 --> 02:06:51.704
AUTHORITIES TO ENSURE THAT

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.105
CONSUMERS WERE PROTECTED.

02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:54.340
A CALIFORNIA CONSUMER BUREAU

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:55.674
SHOULD ENJOY THE SAME RANGE OF

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:57.276
AUTHORITIES IN ORDER TO HOLD

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:59.745
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE

02:06:59.812 --> 02:07:01.113
SAME RANGE OF HARM.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.414
IN CLOSING.

02:07:02.481 --> 02:07:03.115
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF

02:07:03.182 --> 02:07:04.550
THE COMMON RETORTS I KNOW YOU

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:06.251
WILL HEAR AS YOU UNDERTAKE THIS

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:08.020
AMBITIOUS AGENDA ON BEHALF OF

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:09.555
THE PEOPLE YOU SERVE.

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:11.023
SOME WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN

02:07:11.090 --> 02:07:12.591
ACT.

02:07:12.658 --> 02:07:13.192
OR THAT THIS IS IN WHAT STATE

02:07:13.258 --> 02:07:14.026
GOVERNMENT STILL.

02:07:14.093 --> 02:07:14.927
SOME WILL SAY THAT YOUR

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.862
ASPIRATIONS ARE TOO GREAT AND

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:17.663
THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT THE STATUS

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:18.797
QUO.

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:19.531
THEY WILL SEE THAT THIS IS THE

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:21.033
WORK OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:07:21.100 --> 02:07:22.468
AND SUGGEST THAT STATES MUST

02:07:22.534 --> 02:07:24.036
ALWAYS PLAY SECOND FIDDLE.

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:25.137
THEY WILL TELL YOU TO TEMPER

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:27.239
YOUR EXPECTATIONS AND AMBITIONS

02:07:27.306 --> 02:07:28.474
OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE.

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.742
THEY ARE WRONG THEY ARE WRONG

02:07:29.808 --> 02:07:31.143
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:32.644
THIS UNIQUE MOMENT IN TIME.

02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:33.846
THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WILL

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:35.314
OF THIS COMMITTEE WERE OF THIS

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:37.549
ASSEMBLY TO ACT OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:07:37.616 --> 02:07:39.251
ACT. TO SHOW A DIFFERENT PATH

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:40.986
THAN WHAT IS BEING OFFERED THREE

02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:42.321
THOUSAND MILES AWAY. ONE THAT

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:43.689
PUTS PEOPLE ABOVE SPECIAL

02:07:43.756 --> 02:07:45.624
INTERESTS ONE THAT STANDS OUT

02:07:45.691 --> 02:07:47.026
FOR BORROWERS RIGHTS WHEN THAT

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:48.494
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WELL BEING

02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:50.496
OF THIS STATE OF THIS NATION IS

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:51.797
PREMISED ON PROTECTING IT'S

02:07:51.864 --> 02:07:53.732
CONSUMERS WITH ITS FULL RANGE OF

02:07:53.799 --> 02:07:54.666
AUTHORITIES.

02:07:54.733 --> 02:07:56.101
WHEN THAT IS WILLING TO OVERCOME

02:07:56.168 --> 02:07:57.269
INERTIA AND IN ACTION?

02:07:57.336 --> 02:07:58.370
THEY ARE WRONG BECAUSE WE KNOW

02:07:58.437 --> 02:07:59.872
THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL STAND

02:07:59.938 --> 02:08:01.740
UP IT WILL STAND UP FOR THE

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:03.108
THIRTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:05.044
STATE CHASING THE AMERICAN DREAM.

02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:07.880
AND IT WILL SHOW THEM THAT THERE

02:08:07.946 --> 02:08:08.313
IS A DIFFERENT PATH.

02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:09.248
THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:08:09.314 --> 02:08:10.516

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:15.821
COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS.

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:17.289
ASSEMBLYMEMBER STONE AND THEN

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:19.091
THE PHONE NUMBER CERVANTES.

02:08:19.158 --> 02:08:21.493
SAMBAR GABRIEL.

02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:22.795
I THINK THE FIRST HALF OF THAT

02:08:22.861 --> 02:08:24.596
IS THE CLOSE WHEN I PRESENT MY

02:08:24.663 --> 02:08:26.198
BILL THANK.

02:08:26.265 --> 02:08:28.133

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.835
THANK YOU IN AND YOU PROVIDED A

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:30.669
GREAT DEAL OF TECHNICAL

02:08:30.736 --> 02:08:32.137
ASSISTANCE AS WE TRY TO SORT

02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:33.605
THROUGH.

02:08:33.672 --> 02:08:36.008
DEALING WITH THAT THE LICENSING

02:08:36.075 --> 02:08:38.844
BILL AND AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET

02:08:38.911 --> 02:08:40.446
DONE IND OF WHAT WE COULD GET

02:08:40.512 --> 02:08:41.947
DONE IN THAT BILL AND FROM THE

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:43.715
LICENSING PROGRAM.

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:45.350
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:08:45.417 --> 02:08:46.985
GAPS THAT ARE STILL THERE AND I

02:08:47.052 --> 02:08:48.120
THINK FROM YOUR TESTIMONY IN

02:08:48.187 --> 02:08:50.022
PRIOR TESTIMONY DATA COLLECTION

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:51.690
IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE KEY

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:53.392
COMPONENTS CAN YOU TALK ABOUT.

02:08:53.459 --> 02:08:56.562
HOW CFPB WAS ABLE TO AND TWELVE

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:57.996
WHAT ASPECT DATA COLLECTION

02:08:58.063 --> 02:08:58.931
PLAYED?

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:01.166
IN HOW YOU WERE THEN ABLE TO

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:03.502
ENFORCE AND AND MANAGES FIRST I

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:04.570
KNOW YOUR EXPERTISE AND STUDENT

02:09:04.636 --> 02:09:06.238
LOANS AND SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT

02:09:06.305 --> 02:09:08.507
THAT BUT I THINK IT TRANSLATES

02:09:08.574 --> 02:09:09.608
TO THE BIGGER QUESTIONS ABOUT.

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:10.576
SO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

02:09:10.642 --> 02:09:12.411
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES OF THE

02:09:12.478 --> 02:09:14.012
CREATION OF THE BUREAU WAS A

02:09:14.079 --> 02:09:15.948
REAL REALIZATION AFTER THE

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:17.483
FINANCIAL CRISIS.

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:19.918
THAT -- HOW COULD THE REGULATORS

02:09:19.985 --> 02:09:21.487
HAVE MISSED THIS HOW COULD THIS

02:09:21.553 --> 02:09:22.855
HAVE HAPPENED?

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:25.224
AND THEY INSTILLED THE BUREAU

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:26.658
BOTH THAT I THOUGHT ALREADY AND

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:29.862
THE MIND SET TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:31.463
WERE AWARE OF EMERGING RISKS.

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:33.699
AND RIGHT NOW I CAN THINK OF

02:09:33.765 --> 02:09:35.434
REALLY NO LARGER AND MERGING

02:09:35.501 --> 02:09:36.368
RISK THEN THE STUDENT LOAN

02:09:36.435 --> 02:09:38.971
MARKET WE THERE'S ONE POINT FIVE

02:09:39.037 --> 02:09:41.073
TRILLION DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:44.510
DEBT -- ONE POINT TWO ONE POINT

02:09:44.576 --> 02:09:46.178
THREE TRILLION DOLLARS OF THAT

02:09:46.245 --> 02:09:48.113
DEBT HE IS HELD BY THE

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:49.681
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BUT

02:09:49.748 --> 02:09:51.950
SERVICE BY INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES.

02:09:52.017 --> 02:09:54.786
AND IT'S ENTIRELY A BLACK HOLE.

02:09:54.853 --> 02:09:55.821
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:58.891
BUREAU TRIED TO WORK ON WHERE WE

02:09:58.957 --> 02:10:00.993
ACTUALLY SUBMITTED -- A MARKET

02:10:01.059 --> 02:10:02.995
MONITORING REQUEST WHICH IS

02:10:03.061 --> 02:10:04.062
PROVIDED UNDER THE DODD FRANK

02:10:04.129 --> 02:10:05.097
ACT TO GET A BETTER

02:10:05.164 --> 02:10:06.265
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:07.065
HAPPENING IN THE STUDENT LOAN

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.234
MARKET HOUSE SERVICERS ARE

02:10:09.301 --> 02:10:11.236
OPERATING WHERE BORROWERS ARE

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:12.171
GETTING HURT.

02:10:12.237 --> 02:10:14.606
UNFORTUNATELY -- THIS IS JUST

02:10:14.673 --> 02:10:17.409
ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF A VERY

02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:20.913
COMMON SENSE STRAIGHT FORWARD.

02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:23.081
A POLITICAL EXERCISE THAT WAS

02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:24.883
COMPLETELY STYMIED SO THIS WAS

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:26.718
AN EFFORT THAT WENT INTO THE

02:10:26.785 --> 02:10:28.720
OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET --

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:31.523
IN -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND HAS

02:10:31.590 --> 02:10:33.025
JUST NEVER COME OUT.

02:10:33.091 --> 02:10:34.560
SO RIGHT NOW THIS EFFORT TO

02:10:34.626 --> 02:10:36.195
BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:38.630
HAPPENING IN THE MARKET --

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:39.431
HASN'T EVEN GOTTEN OFF THE

02:10:39.498 --> 02:10:41.366
GROUND AND NO ONE KNOWS IF IT

02:10:41.433 --> 02:10:42.734
EVER WILL AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:10:42.801 --> 02:10:44.903
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOUR

02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:46.638
LEGISLATION SO CRITICAL IS A

02:10:46.705 --> 02:10:48.740
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA A QUICK

02:10:48.807 --> 02:10:50.475
THROUGH DB -- WORTH THROUGH A

02:10:50.542 --> 02:10:53.078
NEW AGENCY TO GET ITS HANDS ON

02:10:53.145 --> 02:10:54.813
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO CALIFORNIA

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.516
BORROWERS IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL

02:10:57.583 --> 02:10:58.250
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEN

02:10:58.317 --> 02:11:01.453
FORSMAN SUPERVISION RULE MAKING.

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.487
COULD BE A REAL.

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:04.423
HELP TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY

02:11:04.489 --> 02:11:05.791
AS THEY TRY TO TACKLE THE

02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.326
STUDENT DEBT CRISIS.

02:11:07.392 --> 02:11:08.694
AND IT SEEMS AND AND OF HOW

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:10.529
EXACTLY THAT THREAD IT SEEMS IT

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:12.631
WHAT WHAT WE DID ON STERN

02:11:12.698 --> 02:11:13.665
LANCERS HIS WAS WITH THE BE --

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:15.000
ANDWE TALK ABOUT IN THE NEW

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:17.636
LEGISLATION A STUDENT LOAN

02:11:17.703 --> 02:11:19.438
ADVOCATE BUT THAT PROBABLY

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:21.373
SHOULD BE SOMEBODY SEPARATE AND

02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:23.508
OUTSIDE OBVIOUSLY OF D. B. S. O.

02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:25.844
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IF WE CAN

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:26.979
BE TALKING ABOUT.

02:11:27.045 --> 02:11:27.980
SOME KIND OF THE CONSUMER

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:30.048
PROTECTION BUREAU THAT'S WHERE

02:11:30.115 --> 02:11:32.184
THAT SHOULD RESIDE AND I I HOPE

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:33.118
WE CAN STILL HAVE THE

02:11:33.185 --> 02:11:35.187
CONVERSATION ABOUT LOOKING FOR A

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.388
STUDENT ON ADVOCATE.

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:38.323
BUT I AGREE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:39.891
ON SORT OF LITTLE THE LARGER

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:41.360
QUESTION ABOUT CONSUMER

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:42.928
PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:11:42.995 --> 02:11:44.329
MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT IN THE END

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:45.998
PIECE MEALING SOME OF THESE

02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:47.399
PIECES TOGETHER AND AND I THINK.

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:49.134
THAT YOU TO SORT OF START OUT

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:49.901
WITH THE STUDENTS BUT KIND OF

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:51.370
TIED SOME OF THE REST OF THAT

02:11:51.436 --> 02:11:52.471
TOGETHER.

02:11:52.537 --> 02:11:53.672
YES I THINK IT DEFINITELY

02:11:53.739 --> 02:11:55.340
CRITICAL I'M OBVIOUSLY BIASED

02:11:55.407 --> 02:11:56.275
TOWARDS THE POSITION BECAUSE

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:59.678
THAT WAS MY JOB FOR A FEW YEARS --

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:01.280
BUT I THINK HAVING.

02:12:01.346 --> 02:12:02.547
IN DIRECTOR CORDRAY SAID THIS

02:12:02.614 --> 02:12:03.682
MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD HAVING

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.851
AN AGENCY WHOSE SOLE MISSION IT

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:08.120
IS TO LOOK OUT FOR CONSUMERS.

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:11.189
AND THEN BEING LUCKY ENOUGH FOR

02:12:11.256 --> 02:12:12.024
THE THE SUBSET OF THAT.

02:12:12.090 --> 02:12:13.392
BUILDING THAT LOOKED OUT FOR

02:12:13.458 --> 02:12:15.460
STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS EVERY DAY

02:12:15.527 --> 02:12:18.664
I JUST SAW THE DIFFERENCE WHERE --

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:21.133
ME AND MY TEAM WORK UP EVERY DAY

02:12:21.199 --> 02:12:21.700
ABOUT THINKING ABOUT STUDENT

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:22.734
LOANS.

02:12:22.801 --> 02:12:24.536
NOT FROM AFFORDABILITY NOT FROM

02:12:24.603 --> 02:12:26.271
AN ACCESS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:28.340
STUFF BUT SIMPLY FROM A CONSUMER

02:12:28.407 --> 02:12:31.176
PROTECTION ANGLE -- WAS

02:12:31.243 --> 02:12:33.011
INCREDIBLE TO DO NOT ONLY THE

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:35.247
BORROWERS WE HELPED BUT ADDING

02:12:35.314 --> 02:12:36.948
LIKE A REALLY VALUABLE PART OF

02:12:37.015 --> 02:12:39.518
THE DISCUSSION IN WASHINGTON I

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.219
THINK I'LL BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:43.221
ABOUT HOW YOU HELP BORROWERS

02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:46.358
AFTER THEY TAKE ON THE DEBT SO --

02:12:46.425 --> 02:12:48.393
I THINK THAT -- IS ALSO VERY

02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.128
HELPFUL TO HAVE ONE PERSON IN

02:12:50.195 --> 02:12:52.030
GOVERNMENT SO WHEN YOU'RE

02:12:52.097 --> 02:12:53.298
CONSTITUENTS COM MORE PEOPLE

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:55.367
JUST PICK UP THE PHONE THEY KNOW

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:57.069
WHERE TO GO TO TRY TO GET HELP.

02:12:57.135 --> 02:12:58.170
AND THAT PARTS.

02:12:58.236 --> 02:12:59.604
PROVING VERY POPULAR.

02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:01.340
AS PEOPLE ARE WEIGHING IN ON

02:13:01.406 --> 02:13:02.908
WHERE THAT POLICY IS AND AND

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:05.377
HAVING A PLACE TO GO.

02:13:05.444 --> 02:13:06.812
SO THAT.

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:07.679
AS WE AS WE TRIED TO DO THE

02:13:07.746 --> 02:13:08.880
LICENSING THING AND WE HEARD

02:13:08.947 --> 02:13:10.382
FROM SOME THE LARGER SERVICERS

02:13:10.449 --> 02:13:11.483
WHO WERE COSTLY TELLING US --

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:12.751
THERE'S A GOOD ACTORS THERE'S A

02:13:12.818 --> 02:13:13.552
GOOD ACTORS.

02:13:13.618 --> 02:13:15.354
NOW.

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.221
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS THAT

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:17.656
CALIFORNIA'S SUING THEM I KNOW

02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:18.924
THEY'RE BEING SUED IN MANY MANY

02:13:18.990 --> 02:13:20.225
OTHER STATES THAT THEY'RE DOING

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:21.560
BUSINESS.

02:13:21.626 --> 02:13:22.160
SO IT'S SORT OF HARD TO FIGURE

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:24.096
OUT.

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:24.863
WHO ULTIMATELY THE GOOD ACTORS

02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:25.764
ARE?

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.532
NOW THAT THERE'S AND I THINK

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:29.034
THERE'S AT LEAST ONCE WE DID THE

02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:31.203
STUDENT LOAN SERVICING.

02:13:31.269 --> 02:13:33.205
OVERSIGHT THE LICENSING PROGRAM

02:13:33.271 --> 02:13:34.539
THERE WERE OVER A DOZEN STATES

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:36.074
THAT ARE DOING THE SAME THING

02:13:36.141 --> 02:13:36.908
NOW THOSE.

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.143
THEY'RE RUNNING BACK TO THE

02:13:38.210 --> 02:13:39.244
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:41.646
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION LOOKING

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:43.515
FOR A LITTLE BIT OF COVER AND

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:45.083
CLAIMING SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:45.150 --> 02:13:47.285
HAVE TO THREAD THE ISSUE OF

02:13:47.352 --> 02:13:48.820
PREEMPTION THERE NOW I KNOW THE

02:13:48.887 --> 02:13:50.822
DODD FRANK IT'S FAIRLY CLEAR.

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:51.990
THAT STATES HAVE THE ABILITY TO

02:13:52.057 --> 02:13:53.625
GO FORWARD AND WE'RE TRYING TO

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:56.128
RELY ON SOME OF THAT LANGUAGE.

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:58.230
HOUSE HOW HOW MUCH PREEMPTION

02:13:58.296 --> 02:13:59.664
ESPECIALLY WHERE THE FEDERAL

02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:01.500
GOVERNMENT SORT OF WANTS TO

02:14:01.566 --> 02:14:03.135
WEIGH IN OR WANTS TO PROTECT

02:14:03.201 --> 02:14:04.770
THIS INDUSTRY OVER.

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:07.139
THE BORROWERS AND AND OVER OUR

02:14:07.205 --> 02:14:08.240
CONSTITUENTS.

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:09.808
BUT HOW CAN THEY BY DOING

02:14:09.875 --> 02:14:11.510
NOTHING.

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.078
MAKE MAKE A VALID CLAIM OF

02:14:13.145 --> 02:14:15.714
PREEMPTING US FROM BEING ABLE TO

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:18.283
TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND

02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:21.119
AND PROVIDE A A CLEAR PATH FOR

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:22.320
STUDENT BORROWERS.

02:14:22.387 --> 02:14:24.556
SO A COUPLE POINTS SO YOU KNOW I

02:14:24.623 --> 02:14:26.324
THINK THE FIRST POINT IS WHO ARE

02:14:26.391 --> 02:14:27.759
THE GOOD ACTORS.

02:14:27.826 --> 02:14:29.194
I THINK THE GOOD ACTORS ARE THE

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:32.230
ONES WHO -- OPEN THEMSELVES UP

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:34.433
TO SUPERVISION AND SAY WE HAVE

02:14:34.499 --> 02:14:36.968
NOTHING TO HIDE AND ALSO WE

02:14:37.035 --> 02:14:38.570
THINK THE SUPERVISORY PROCESS IN

02:14:38.637 --> 02:14:40.739
WHICH EXAMINERS FROM THE

02:14:40.806 --> 02:14:42.507
GOVERNMENT COME IN AND TELL US

02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:43.775
WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT BUT TELL

02:14:43.842 --> 02:14:45.210
US WHAT WE'RE DOING WRONG IN A

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:47.579
CONFIDENTIAL PROCESS -- THOSE

02:14:47.646 --> 02:14:49.347
THE PEOPLE I THINK THAT YOU

02:14:49.414 --> 02:14:49.948
SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:50.749
PEOPLE ARE SAYING.

02:14:50.816 --> 02:14:51.983
WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE

02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:53.251
PROVIDER OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL

02:14:53.318 --> 02:14:54.119
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND WE

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:55.554
WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.289
SUPERVISION OVERSIGHT BECAUSE WE

02:14:57.355 --> 02:14:58.990
THINK WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB WE

02:14:59.057 --> 02:15:00.358
COULD ALWAYS BE DOING BETTER.

02:15:00.425 --> 02:15:02.561
WHAT SCARES ME BASED ON MY PRIOR

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:04.162
OR THE COMPANIES WHO ARGUE THAT

02:15:04.229 --> 02:15:06.598
THEY'RE ABOVE THE LAW WHICH

02:15:06.665 --> 02:15:07.732
TAKES YOU TO YOUR SECOND POINT?

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:08.934
AND BOTH INDUSTRY AND

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:10.035
UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT

02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:13.071
ADMINISTRATION HAVE MADE THESE

02:15:13.138 --> 02:15:14.639
ARGUMENTS THAT FOLKS LIKE YOU

02:15:14.706 --> 02:15:15.774
FOLKS LIKE THIS STATE ARE

02:15:15.841 --> 02:15:17.676
SOMEHOW TRYING TO REGULATE THE

02:15:17.742 --> 02:15:19.177
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:19.778
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM

02:15:19.845 --> 02:15:20.545
THE TRUTH.

02:15:20.612 --> 02:15:22.080
STUDENT LOAN SERVICERS ARE SOME

02:15:22.147 --> 02:15:23.748
OF THE LARGEST FINANCIAL

02:15:23.815 --> 02:15:25.817
SERVICES COMPANIES IN AMERICA --

02:15:25.884 --> 02:15:26.818
SOME OF THESE COMPANIES SERVICE

02:15:26.885 --> 02:15:29.354
OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY

02:15:29.421 --> 02:15:31.223
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CONSUMER

02:15:31.289 --> 02:15:33.091
DEBT -- TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE

02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:35.293
OF WHAT SIZE THIS THIS COMPANY.

02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:37.028
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OUT OF

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:38.930
EVERY TEN DOLLARS OF NON

02:15:38.997 --> 02:15:40.966
CONSUMER DEBT IN AMERICA.

02:15:41.032 --> 02:15:43.134
AND THEY ARE ARGUING THAT YOUR

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:45.403
STATE LAWS DON'T APPLY -- AND I

02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:46.938
JUST THINK THAT IS WRONG I THINK

02:15:47.005 --> 02:15:48.707
ESSENTIALLY WHAT THAT BILL DID

02:15:48.773 --> 02:15:49.708
WHAT OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO

02:15:49.774 --> 02:15:51.576
DO NOW WHAT THE EXTENSION BILL

02:15:51.643 --> 02:15:52.911
THE BAR A BILL OF RIGHTS DOES.

02:15:52.978 --> 02:15:54.279
IS JUST RECOGNIZE THE

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:56.181
TRADITIONAL POLICE POWERS THAT

02:15:56.248 --> 02:15:58.316
THIS STATE HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT

02:15:58.383 --> 02:16:00.952
IT CURRENTLY USES ACROSS A RANGE

02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:04.756
OF NON BANK PROVIDERS -- AND

02:16:04.823 --> 02:16:05.724
MERELY EXTENDS THAT. TO FOR MANY

02:16:05.790 --> 02:16:06.992
OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE MOST

02:16:07.058 --> 02:16:08.660
IMPORTANT FINANCIAL COMPANY IN

02:16:08.727 --> 02:16:10.061
THEIR LIVES WHICH IS THE COMPANY

02:16:10.128 --> 02:16:11.763
RESPONSIBLE FOR TRYING TO HELP

02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:13.131
THEM PAY OFF THEIR DEBT.

02:16:13.198 --> 02:16:15.033
SO I KNOW THE ARGUMENTS ARE

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:16.768
THERE I KNOW THAT THEY'RE A

02:16:16.835 --> 02:16:18.403
SOURCE OF CONSTERNATION -- I

02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:20.705
THINK IN MANY REGARDS THE EFFORT

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.641
IS TO KIND OF THROW A LOT OF

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:24.009
SMOKE UP IN THE AIR AND FIGURE

02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:25.644
OUT WHICH LEGISLATURE'S WHICH

02:16:25.710 --> 02:16:26.678
THINKING DEPARTMENTS WHICH

02:16:26.745 --> 02:16:27.879
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S.

02:16:27.946 --> 02:16:30.282
ARE WILLING TO PUSH THRILL AND

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:30.849
WHERE I THINK STUDENT LOAN

02:16:30.916 --> 02:16:31.683
BORROWERS ARE.

02:16:31.750 --> 02:16:33.184
SHOULD BE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:34.219
YOUR EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE'S

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:36.187
EFFORTS OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:38.056
TO PUSH PAST A LOT OF THE

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:40.292
ARGUMENTS WE'VE HEARD BECAUSE

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.693
AGAIN THIS IS A GOOD FOR MANY

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.261
PEOPLE THE LARGEST.

02:16:43.328 --> 02:16:43.662
CONSUMER FINANCIAL

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:46.131
PRODUKTIVNOSTI CHEN AND THE

02:16:46.197 --> 02:16:47.432
COMPANIES AT THE CENTER OF THIS

02:16:47.499 --> 02:16:49.034
JUST AREN'T DOING THE JOB.

02:16:49.100 --> 02:16:51.770
AND THAT THERE IS A THERE IS A

02:16:51.836 --> 02:16:53.271
ROLE FOR STATES TO PLAY.

02:16:53.338 --> 02:16:54.339
IN FOR A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IT'S

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:55.840
THEIR SINGLE LARGEST THAT OR

02:16:55.907 --> 02:16:56.841
THEIR SECOND BECAUSE STUDENT

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:58.577
LOAN THAT IS REALLY ONLY SECOND

02:16:58.643 --> 02:16:59.978
BEHIND HOME MORTGAGES.

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.746
BUT YET HOME MORTGAGES CREDIT

02:17:01.813 --> 02:17:04.382
CARDS CAR LOANS THERE ARE.

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:06.418
STRONGER REGULATORY SCHEMES FOR

02:17:06.484 --> 02:17:07.986
PROTECTIONS THERE THERE'S VERY

02:17:08.053 --> 02:17:09.921
LITTLE IF ANYTHING FOR STUDENT

02:17:09.988 --> 02:17:11.590
LOAN.

02:17:11.656 --> 02:17:13.725
BORROWERS TO TO RELY AND WE'RE

02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:15.460
WE'RE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THE GAP

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:16.962
WERE ULTIMATELY TRY TO FAIL AND

02:17:17.028 --> 02:17:17.596
YOU DON'T YEAH.

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:18.730
EXACTLY RIGHT AND YOU DON'T HAVE

02:17:18.797 --> 02:17:20.298
TO TAKE MY WORD ON IT SO

02:17:20.365 --> 02:17:21.499
SECRETARY MINU CHIN PUT OUT A

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:24.869
BIG REPORT ABOUT THE STATE OF

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:26.771
THINK FINTECH IN OTHER EMERGING

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.006
TECHNOLOGIES.

02:17:28.073 --> 02:17:29.240
AND THERE WAS A PRETTY

02:17:29.307 --> 02:17:30.442
SIGNIFICANT SECTION TALKING

02:17:30.508 --> 02:17:31.810
ABOUT STUDENT LOANS AND STUDENT

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:33.211
LOAN SERVICING.

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.779
AND HIS WORDS WERE THE SAME

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:35.914
THERE ARE NO FEDERALLY

02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:37.649
GUARANTEED STANDARDS FOR STUDENT

02:17:37.716 --> 02:17:38.984
LOAN BORROWERS AGAIN THIS ISN'T

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:41.486
LIKE A POLITICAL PARTISAN ISSUE.

02:17:41.553 --> 02:17:43.388
IT IS A GENERATION OF BORROWERS

02:17:43.455 --> 02:17:46.157
OLD RURAL URBAN YOU NAME IT --

02:17:46.224 --> 02:17:47.759
WHO ARE REALLY STRUGGLING AND IF

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:49.461
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ISN'T

02:17:49.527 --> 02:17:52.697
GOING TO DO ITS JOB -- THEN I

02:17:52.764 --> 02:17:54.065
THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE

02:17:54.132 --> 02:17:55.467
STATE'S TO FILL IN THE GAP.

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:56.735
AND SO FAR WHAT WE'VE DONE HAVE

02:17:56.801 --> 02:17:58.370
BROUGHT A LOT OF OTHER STATES

02:17:58.436 --> 02:17:59.170
ALONG SO I THINK THERE ARE

02:17:59.237 --> 02:17:59.871
STATES THAT ARE.

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:01.306
CERTAINLY WATCHING CALIFORNIA

02:18:01.373 --> 02:18:02.474
WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT WE WILL

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:04.275
DO AND I THINK WE NEED TO TO

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:06.211
TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY I THINK

02:18:06.277 --> 02:18:06.845
JUST ONE QUICK THING I THINK YOU

02:18:06.911 --> 02:18:07.479
KNOW.

02:18:07.545 --> 02:18:09.748
YOU STARTED THIS YOU KNOW A VERY

02:18:09.814 --> 02:18:11.516
LONG TIME AGO LIKE THIS WAS NOT

02:18:11.583 --> 02:18:13.918
ABOUT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S

02:18:13.985 --> 02:18:14.853
WAS NOT ABOUT THAT TO DIVIDE US.

02:18:14.919 --> 02:18:16.588
THERE'S BEEN FAILURES ACROSS THE

02:18:16.655 --> 02:18:18.023
STUDENT LOAN SERVICING INDUSTRY

02:18:18.089 --> 02:18:19.624
ACROSS PARTIES ACROSS THE

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.693
MINISTRATIONS -- AND I THINK

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:22.927
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO YOU THIS

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:23.895
COMMITTEE IN THIS STATE TO

02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:25.163
REALIZE THAT.

02:18:25.230 --> 02:18:26.598
REGARDLESS OF WHO'S SITTING IN

02:18:26.665 --> 02:18:27.899
THE WHITE HOUSE OF WHO WAS AT

02:18:27.966 --> 02:18:33.238
THE BUREAU THIS WAS A CENTRAL --

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:34.139
RESPONSIBILITY AN OPPORTUNITY

02:18:34.205 --> 02:18:34.739
FOR THE STATE TO STAND UP FOR

02:18:34.806 --> 02:18:36.474
ITS PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF WHO IS

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:37.275
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND I THINK

02:18:37.342 --> 02:18:39.711
THAT IS -- THAT'S A TESTAMENT TO

02:18:39.778 --> 02:18:40.912
YOUR WORK WELL AND THAT'S TRUE

02:18:40.979 --> 02:18:42.647
BECAUSE WE STARTED THIS AND THE

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:44.482
NEXT AT ONE POINT ONE OF THE

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:45.850
STEPS WE KNEW WE NEEDED TO TAKE

02:18:45.917 --> 02:18:47.152
WAS TO HARMONIZE.

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:48.920
THE STATE'S LAW WITH THE FEDERAL

02:18:48.987 --> 02:18:50.355
REGULATORY SCHEME THAT WAS

02:18:50.422 --> 02:18:51.756
COMING OUT THAT'S SCHEME

02:18:51.823 --> 02:18:53.558
DISAPPEARED SO THERE WAS NOTHING

02:18:53.625 --> 02:18:54.693
TO HARMONIZE WITH WE WERE SORT

02:18:54.759 --> 02:18:56.194
OF LEFT ON OUR OWN.

02:18:56.261 --> 02:18:57.362
THAT'S WHERE WE ENDED UP AND

02:18:57.429 --> 02:19:00.098
THAT WAS WHAT LED TO THE PASSING

02:19:00.165 --> 02:19:02.934
OF THE STUDENTS SERVICER

02:19:03.001 --> 02:19:05.270

ON A QUESTION THAT I HAD BUT I

02:19:10.809 --> 02:19:12.110
JUST WANT TO SPEAK AS A

02:19:12.177 --> 02:19:14.112
MILLENNIAL -- MILLENNIALS ARE A

02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:16.448
GENERATION SHAPED BY EXPERIENCES

02:19:16.514 --> 02:19:18.583

HIGH LEVELS OF STUDENT DEBT AND

02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:22.620

02:19:22.687 --> 02:19:24.456
A CONCERN TO ME AND THAT I AM

THANK YOU FOR GIVING US SOME

02:19:30.562 --> 02:19:32.297
ACTIONABLE STEPS THAT WE CAN

TAKE A AS A STATE TO ADDRESSES

IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IT'S

02:19:44.609 --> 02:19:46.111
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED ALSO VERY

02:19:46.177 --> 02:19:47.612
MUCH CONCERNING TO HEAR YOU

TESTIFY ABOUT THE CURRENT CFPB

02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.115
IN ITS.

02:19:50.181 --> 02:19:51.149
EFFORTS TO PRIORITIZE

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.284
CORPORATIONS ABOVE CONSUMERS AND

02:19:53.351 --> 02:19:54.919
THE STRUGGLE FACED BY.

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:56.221
SO MANY STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:57.355
WHICH AS YOU PUT IT DEEPLY

02:19:57.422 --> 02:19:58.990
IMPACTS THEIR PROSPECTS FOR

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.925
CHEATING THE AMERICAN DREAM AND

02:20:00.992 --> 02:20:02.227
THE FACT THAT THE REALLY AS YOU

02:20:02.293 --> 02:20:04.129
AS YOU DESCRIBED IT NO LARGER

02:20:04.195 --> 02:20:05.029
EMERGING REST IN STUDENT LOAN

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:05.897
DEBT I MEAN HE'S JUST VERY

02:20:05.964 --> 02:20:06.965
CONCERNING TESTIMONY YOU'RE

02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:08.433
CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT.

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:09.667
OF CREDIBILITY ON THAT ISSUE.

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:10.635
GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE IN YOUR

02:20:10.702 --> 02:20:11.770
VANTAGE POINT WOULD YOU THINK

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:13.271
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS THE

02:20:13.338 --> 02:20:15.106
CALIFORNIA CAN TAKEN GIVEN THE

02:20:15.173 --> 02:20:16.708
URGENCY OF THIS MATTER WHAT

02:20:16.775 --> 02:20:17.242
WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT WE

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:19.110
PRIORITIZE.

02:20:19.177 --> 02:20:21.513
SO -- A COUPLE THINGS I MENTION

02:20:21.579 --> 02:20:23.648
MY TESTIMONY I THINK -- ASSEMBLY

02:20:23.715 --> 02:20:25.483
MEMBER STONE'S BILL -- IS

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:27.919
CRITICAL -- BOTH FOR THIS STATE

02:20:27.986 --> 02:20:29.420
AND I THINK AS WE'VE SEEN WITH

02:20:29.487 --> 02:20:31.923
PRIOR WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE.

02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:33.591
QUICKLY BECOMES THE ROAD MAP

02:20:33.658 --> 02:20:35.026
THAT OTHER STATES WILL FOLLOW SO

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:37.562
GIVING BORROWER GIVING BORROWERS

02:20:37.629 --> 02:20:38.897
THE SAME RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:39.898
THAT THEY HAVE IF THEY HAD A

02:20:39.964 --> 02:20:41.833
CREDIT CARD OR MORTGAGE YOU HAVE

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:43.134
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO.

02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:44.369
AT THE STATE LEVEL WHEN IT COMES

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:45.603
TO STUDENT LOANS.

02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:47.272
MAKING SURE THAT WHEN BORROWERS

02:20:47.338 --> 02:20:50.341
GET RIPPED OFF THEY HAVE THE

02:20:50.408 --> 02:20:52.443
RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY TO SEEK

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:54.946
JUSTICE -- AT THE STATE LEVEL IS

02:20:55.013 --> 02:20:56.314
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

02:20:56.381 --> 02:20:58.049
AND THEN ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

02:20:58.116 --> 02:20:59.417
THIS STATE IS ON THE FOREFRONT

02:20:59.484 --> 02:21:01.452
OF BETTER OVERSEEING THE MARKET

02:21:01.519 --> 02:21:02.954
BOTH IN TERMS OF THE ADVOCATE.

02:21:03.021 --> 02:21:04.389
AND THE MARKET BOTHERING

02:21:04.455 --> 02:21:05.757
EXPERIENCES I THINK WOULD GO A

02:21:05.824 --> 02:21:07.959
LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING.

02:21:08.026 --> 02:21:09.961
THAT MILLIONS OF STUDENT LOAN

02:21:10.028 --> 02:21:11.396
BORROWERS IN THIS STATE.

02:21:11.462 --> 02:21:13.131
I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND PIECE

02:21:13.198 --> 02:21:14.065
I THINK THIS GOES TO SEVEN

02:21:14.132 --> 02:21:15.733
NUMBER SO IT'S COMMON IS THERE'S

02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:17.702
GONNA BE SOME BATTLES THAT COME

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:19.237
UP I THINK THAT THERE IS A

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:20.905
CONCERTED EFFORT.

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:23.541
BY INDUSTRY -- AND THE CARD

02:21:23.608 --> 02:21:24.976
ADMINISTRATION AND SOME HARD

02:21:25.043 --> 02:21:26.477

REALLY IMPORTANT IN COURT HERE

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:57.055
AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE

02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:58.389
EXISTING AGENCIES THAT DO PLAY

02:24:58.456 --> 02:24:59.957
CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLE WE HAVE

02:25:00.024 --> 02:25:00.491

OVERSIGHT WE HAVE.

02:25:01.993 --> 02:25:02.860
THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL

THAT HAVE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OF

02:25:05.063 --> 02:25:05.496
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:25:05.563 --> 02:25:07.198
FRAMEWORK BUT WE NEED SOMETHING

MORE UNIFIED MORE COMPREHENSIVE

02:25:09.700 --> 02:25:11.369
AND I WOULD SAY -- COORDINATED

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:12.303
SO I THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A

02:25:12.370 --> 02:25:14.038
COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED

02:25:14.105 --> 02:25:16.641

ASIDE FOR NOW HOW WE'RE LITTLE

02:25:21.112 --> 02:25:21.813
GOING TO STAND THIS UP I THINK

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.047
THOSE NEED TO BE ON OUR NORTH

02:25:23.114 --> 02:25:25.516
STAR PRINCIPLES FOR HOW WE MOVE

02:25:25.583 --> 02:25:26.784
FORWARD FROM HERE ON OUT.

02:25:26.851 --> 02:25:28.019
NOW OUR PREVIOUS PANELISTS

02:25:28.086 --> 02:25:30.154
MENTIONED SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.823
HOW THE BUREAU WAS ABLE TO BE A

02:25:31.889 --> 02:25:34.158
AFFECTED CERTAINLY TALKED ABOUT

02:25:34.225 --> 02:25:36.194
THE COMPREHENSIVE TOOLS -- AND

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:37.829
THE AND THE INDUSTRY WIDE

02:25:37.895 --> 02:25:39.297
JURISDICTION THE BUREAU HOUSE BY

02:25:39.363 --> 02:25:39.897
D°ûI HIGHLY JUST A FEW

02:25:39.964 --> 02:25:42.333
ADDITIONAL ITEMS THAT SHOW HOW

02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:43.234
HAVING.

02:25:43.301 --> 02:25:45.069
A NEW UNIT OR A NEW AGENCY ISN'T

02:25:45.136 --> 02:25:46.037
NECESSARILY TO PUT COULD HAVE

02:25:46.104 --> 02:25:47.839
BEEN A FACTOR CAN MAKE.

02:25:47.905 --> 02:25:49.240
THE WHOLE BETTER AND GREATER

02:25:49.307 --> 02:25:51.008
THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS -- BY

02:25:51.075 --> 02:25:52.677
HAVING THAT FORCE MULTIPLIER OF

02:25:52.743 --> 02:25:54.145
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION FOCUSES

02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:55.880
SO ONE EXAMPLE WE'VE TALKED

02:25:55.947 --> 02:25:57.582
ABOUT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT --

02:25:57.648 --> 02:25:59.183
WHICH SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX

02:25:59.250 --> 02:26:00.184
IT WAS ENACTED UNDER THE GEORGE

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.819
W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION I'M HAS

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:02.687
ENSURED THAT ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE

02:26:02.753 --> 02:26:04.555
MEMBERS ARE NOT CHARGED MORE

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:05.823
THAN 36% APR.

02:26:05.890 --> 02:26:07.091
IT'S BEEN IT WAS ON THE BOOKS

02:26:07.158 --> 02:26:08.159
FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THE

02:26:08.226 --> 02:26:09.894
CFPB CAME ON THE SCENE WHEN THEY

02:26:09.961 --> 02:26:11.596
FINALLY HAD THE SUPERVISION

02:26:11.662 --> 02:26:13.164
AUTHORITY WITH THE CONSUMER

02:26:13.231 --> 02:26:14.932
PROTECTION LANDS OVER BANKS THEY

02:26:14.999 --> 02:26:17.001
WERE ABLE TO UNCOVER POTENTIAL

02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:17.635
VIOLATIONS.

02:26:17.702 --> 02:26:18.769
AND A PUNCTURE PUBLISHED A

02:26:18.836 --> 02:26:19.837
REPORT BUT THEN HELD A

02:26:19.904 --> 02:26:21.572
ENCOURAGED THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:26:21.639 --> 02:26:22.840
DEFENSE WHICH OTHERWISE OF

02:26:22.907 --> 02:26:24.308
MINISTERS OF THE MILITARY

02:26:24.375 --> 02:26:25.610
LENDING ACT TO AMEND ITS

02:26:25.676 --> 02:26:27.011
REGULATIONS TO CLOSE LOOPHOLES

02:26:27.078 --> 02:26:27.745
THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:28.579
CFPB.

02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:30.281
PROVIDING USING OTHER TOOLS NOT

02:26:30.348 --> 02:26:32.850
PER SE ENFORCEMENT LAWSUITS BUT

02:26:32.917 --> 02:26:34.085
USING OTHER TOOLS TO HELP THE

02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.186
DOD DOING A BETTER JOB OF

02:26:35.253 --> 02:26:37.155
IMPLEMENTING AND OVERSEEING THE

02:26:37.221 --> 02:26:38.623
MILITARY LENDING ACT.

02:26:38.689 --> 02:26:40.858
ANOTHER ONE THAT IS -- YOUR NEAR

02:26:40.925 --> 02:26:41.492
AND DEAR TO ALL OF US WHO HAVE

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:48.633
STUDENT LOANS -- IS THIS YOU

02:26:48.699 --> 02:26:49.667
THESE ROLE IN MAKING THE

02:26:49.734 --> 02:26:51.536
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BETTER I

02:26:51.602 --> 02:26:52.970
AS AS A AS A HAS ALREADY BEEN

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:53.838
TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:54.372
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

02:26:54.438 --> 02:26:55.006
OF COURSE OVERSEAS THE FEDERAL

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:56.174
STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS AND IT

02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:57.475
DOES ISSUE AID TO STUDENTS AND

02:26:57.542 --> 02:26:59.143
HAS OVERSIGHT ROLE OF SCHOOLS

02:26:59.210 --> 02:27:00.211
BUT IT WAS NEVER SET UP AS A

02:27:00.278 --> 02:27:01.345
CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY I

02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:02.280
DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE EVER

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:03.214
EXPECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:27:03.281 --> 02:27:04.782
EDUCATION TO BECOME A TRILLION

02:27:04.849 --> 02:27:05.616
DOLLAR BANK.

02:27:05.683 --> 02:27:07.418
IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO

02:27:07.485 --> 02:27:09.086
IT HAS A MASSIVE PORTFOLIO OF

02:27:09.153 --> 02:27:11.022
LOANS AND THE SERVICING OF THOSE

02:27:11.088 --> 02:27:12.223
LOANS THEY HAVE LARGELY

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:14.091
OUTSOURCED TO TO PRIVATE

02:27:14.158 --> 02:27:16.027
COMPANIES TO THE LOAN SERVICERS --

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:18.129
AND SO AND OF COURSE ALSO BEARS

02:27:18.196 --> 02:27:19.163
MENTIONING THAT IN THE EARLY

02:27:19.230 --> 02:27:20.698
PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN MARKET THE

02:27:20.765 --> 02:27:22.133
DEPARTMENT HAS NO ROLE SO WHEN

02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:24.769
THE CPB WAS ABLE TO STEPIN. TO

02:27:24.835 --> 02:27:26.871
SUPERVISE -- BOTH FEDERAL AND

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:29.173
PRIVATE EDUCATION LOAN SERVICERS

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:31.576
HANDLE COMPLAINTS ON COVER

02:27:31.642 --> 02:27:32.109
PROBLEMS AND WORK WITH THE

02:27:32.176 --> 02:27:34.212
DEPARTMENT -- THE CPP WAS ABLE

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:36.214
WAS BETTER ABLE TO ENSURE THAT

02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.882
SOMEONE WAS TAKING THAT KIND OF

02:27:37.949 --> 02:27:39.750
COLD COHERENT COMPREHENSIVE AND

02:27:39.817 --> 02:27:41.252
CONSUMER PROTECTION FOCUSED LOOK

02:27:41.319 --> 02:27:43.054

UNDER -- AND I WANT TO

02:27:47.425 --> 02:27:49.327
HIGHLIGHTS ONE SPECIFIC AREA

02:27:49.393 --> 02:27:51.295
WHERE THE WHERE THE C. P. B.

02:27:51.362 --> 02:27:52.230
REALLY WHAT WAS IN THE RIGHT

02:27:52.296 --> 02:27:53.130
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:54.932
PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE AND THAT

02:27:54.999 --> 02:27:55.266
WAS DURING.

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:57.201
THE IMPENDING COLLAPSE OF THE

02:27:57.268 --> 02:28:00.004
CLINTON COLLEGES -- WHICH HAD

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:01.906
FOR MANY MANY YEARS -- AS ANY

02:28:01.973 --> 02:28:03.674
LEGAL AID ADVOCATE WILL TELL YOU --

02:28:03.741 --> 02:28:09.780
HAD BEEN MAKING FALSE PROMISES

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.449
GETTING STUDENTS IN THE DOOR.

02:28:11.515 --> 02:28:12.817
PUTTING THEM IN DEBT AND THE NOT

02:28:12.884 --> 02:28:13.451
TRAINING THEM AND THE WAY THEY

02:28:13.517 --> 02:28:14.552
WERE PROMISED IN SO MANY

02:28:14.619 --> 02:28:15.386
STUDENTS WE'RE STUCK WITH THAT

02:28:15.453 --> 02:28:15.987
THE COULD NOT REPAY WE'RE NOT

02:28:16.053 --> 02:28:16.587
GETTING A PROPER EDUCATION AND

02:28:16.654 --> 02:28:17.622
EVENTUALLY IT CAUGHT UP WITH

02:28:17.688 --> 02:28:18.155
CURRENT IN THEIR FINANCIAL

02:28:18.222 --> 02:28:19.290
MISMANAGEMENT -- ACTUALLY CAME

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:20.191
OUT FINALLY CAME UNDER THE RADAR

02:28:20.258 --> 02:28:21.592
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

02:28:21.659 --> 02:28:22.627
AND AS A LOOK AT THE CORINTHIAN

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:24.295
COLLEGES WERE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.

02:28:24.362 --> 02:28:26.364
THE CPB WAS WELL POISED AT THAT

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.366
TIME TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THEY

02:28:28.432 --> 02:28:29.100
HAD ALREADY DONE SOME

02:28:29.166 --> 02:28:30.668
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE LENDING

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:32.436
PRACTICES OF CURRENT THE AND HOW --

02:28:32.503 --> 02:28:33.971
CORINTHIAN COLLEGES HAD NOT JUST

02:28:34.038 --> 02:28:35.606
BEEN MAKING FALSE PROMISES TO

02:28:35.673 --> 02:28:37.174
STUDENTS TO GET THEM TO TAKE OUT

02:28:37.241 --> 02:28:39.877
FEDERAL LOANS IT SEPARATELY BINS

02:28:39.944 --> 02:28:40.811
STEERING THEM INTO PRIVATE LOANS

02:28:40.878 --> 02:28:42.046
WHICH OF COURSE DO NOT HAVE ANY

02:28:42.113 --> 02:28:43.781
REAL CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT

02:28:43.848 --> 02:28:44.715
TODAY.

02:28:44.782 --> 02:28:45.449
AND OUT OF THE CLASS WAS

02:28:45.516 --> 02:28:46.350
HAPPENING TO CONSIDER THE

02:28:46.417 --> 02:28:47.385
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

02:28:47.451 --> 02:28:49.287
BUREAU'S ABILITY TO WORK WITH

02:28:49.353 --> 02:28:50.588
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

02:28:50.655 --> 02:28:52.356
NEGOTIATE A WINDING DOWN OF THE

02:28:52.423 --> 02:28:53.524
COLLEGES.

02:28:53.591 --> 02:28:54.892
THAT RESULTED IN THE BUREAU

02:28:54.959 --> 02:28:56.060
BEING ABLE TO SECURE MILLIONS

02:28:56.127 --> 02:28:57.128
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:28:57.194 --> 02:28:59.697
OF PRIVATE STUDENT DEBT RELIEF

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:00.798
FOR BORROWERS THAT THE

02:29:00.865 --> 02:29:01.932
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON ITS

02:29:01.999 --> 02:29:03.501
OWN SIMPLY COULD NOT HAVE DONE --

02:29:03.567 --> 02:29:04.969
SO THOSE ARE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:07.672
OF HOW HAVING AGAIN THE CONSUMER

02:29:07.738 --> 02:29:10.241
PROTECTION ORIENTED AGENCY WITH

02:29:10.308 --> 02:29:11.475
COMPREHENSIVE JURISDICTION IN

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:13.311
THE ABILITY TO COORDINATE WITH

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:14.478
OTHER AGENCIES.

02:29:14.545 --> 02:29:16.514
MADE OUR FINANCIAL REGULATORY

02:29:16.580 --> 02:29:18.816
SYSTEM THE BETTER FOR ALL OF

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:19.984
THAT -- SO THESE ARE SOME

02:29:20.051 --> 02:29:21.285
LESSONS I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE

02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:21.952
AWAY SO AGAIN WE NEED TO LOOK --

02:29:22.019 --> 02:29:22.853
AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THIS

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:24.488
PROCESS OF FIGURING OUT OF STATE

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.489
LEVEL CONSUMER PROTECTION

02:29:25.556 --> 02:29:26.891
FRAMEWORK -- I THINK THAT

02:29:26.957 --> 02:29:28.559
COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:31.362
TOOLS FOR ENSURING A STRONG AND

02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:32.963
DILIGENT FORCE MEN ARE GOING TO

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:34.699
SERVICE ALL BETTER AND THEN TO

02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:40.237
PIVOT -- TO WERE ALL OUR NEXT

02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:40.871
PANELIST WILL GO I WILL MENTION

02:29:40.938 --> 02:29:41.672
THAT.

02:29:41.739 --> 02:29:42.340
THE PREVIOUS PANELIST RAISE THE

02:29:42.406 --> 02:29:42.907
FACT THAT THERE ARE SPECIAL

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:43.541
POPULATIONS OF THAT THE BUREAU

02:29:43.607 --> 02:29:44.842
HAS STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO LOOK

02:29:44.909 --> 02:29:46.043
AT STUDENTS SERVICE MEMBERS

02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.777
SENIORS AND TRADITIONALLY

02:29:46.844 --> 02:29:48.946
UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS SO IS

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:50.781
ALSO AN EQUITY LENDS BUILT INTO.

02:29:50.848 --> 02:29:52.316
THE WAY THE BUREAU IS STRUCTURED

02:29:52.383 --> 02:29:53.150
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ANOTHER

02:29:53.217 --> 02:29:55.152
AREA WHERE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE

02:29:55.219 --> 02:29:56.921
SHOULD WE SHOULD APPLY THAT

02:29:56.987 --> 02:29:58.956
PRINCIPLE -- BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:29:59.023 --> 02:30:00.124
THE OF THE PRIORITY LEGISLATIVE

02:30:00.191 --> 02:30:01.459
ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:03.060
HERE STOPPING PREDATORY LENDING

02:30:03.127 --> 02:30:03.928
THAT AFFECTS UNDERSERVED

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.830
COMMUNITIES -- YOU KNOW TRYING

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.064
TO REIN IN THE ABUSES OF THE

02:30:07.131 --> 02:30:08.599
STEW LOAN SERVICING INDUSTRY AT

02:30:08.666 --> 02:30:09.700
THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT

02:30:09.767 --> 02:30:11.369
EQUITY AND IT'S ABOUT ECONOMIC

02:30:11.435 --> 02:30:12.670
JUSTICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND

02:30:12.737 --> 02:30:14.672
SO THAT'S ANOTHER VALUE.

02:30:14.739 --> 02:30:16.073
BUT I THINK WE WANT TO TO CARRY

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:17.842
WITH US AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:19.477
THE NEXT BEST STEPS FOR

02:30:19.543 --> 02:30:20.244
IMPLEMENTING A STATE LEVEL

02:30:20.311 --> 02:30:22.146

BOTH RED LINING AND THE RACIAL

IN THE PRESENT AGREE LANDING IS

02:30:58.215 --> 02:30:59.650

ORIGINALLY CREATED TO PROTECT

RESPONSE TO THE TWO THOUSAND

02:31:13.531 --> 02:31:14.465
EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS.

02:31:14.532 --> 02:31:15.599

THE PEOPLE THE BUREAU HAS IN

02:31:19.069 --> 02:31:20.771
MANY WAYS GROW CLOSER TO THE

INDUSTRY -- ONE OF THE MOST

02:31:22.139 --> 02:31:23.207
CONCERNING CHANGES IN THE BUREAU

02:31:23.274 --> 02:31:24.809
IS A ROLL BACK IN FAIR LENDING

02:31:24.875 --> 02:31:26.510
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A CORRUPTION

02:31:26.577 --> 02:31:28.312
OF THE CFE BEES PURPOSE.

02:31:28.379 --> 02:31:29.747
THE CFPB TRADITIONAL VIGILANCE

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:31.115
WAS CRITICAL FOR CONSUMERS OF

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:39.523

02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:40.991
REMAIN COGNIZANT OF THE

02:31:44.295 --> 02:31:44.929
AMPLE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE

02:31:44.995 --> 02:31:45.996
OF COLOR CONTINUE FACING RACISM

02:31:46.063 --> 02:31:47.765
IN MORTGAGE AUTO SMALL BUSINESS

02:31:47.832 --> 02:31:49.567
AND CREDIT CARD LENDING THIS CAN

02:31:49.633 --> 02:31:50.634
MEAN THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:52.336
RECEIVE SMALLER AMOUNTS.

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:53.404
THE REQUESTED WHEN LOOKING FOR

COMPARED TO THE WORRY AT

02:31:59.944 --> 02:32:00.744
COUNTERPARTS.

02:32:00.811 --> 02:32:02.213
DESPITE THESE REALITIES THE CFE

02:32:03.447 --> 02:32:04.849
THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WHICH

02:32:04.915 --> 02:32:06.684
THREATEN THE PEOPLE OF COLORS

IMPACT ASSESSMENTS.

02:32:16.827 --> 02:32:18.162
THIS IS A STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:19.563
THAT LOOK FOR DIFFERENCES IN HOW

EQUITABLE AND NON DISCRIMINATORY

02:33:05.776 --> 02:33:08.345
ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR BOTH

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:09.647

ONLINE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS --

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:19.723
THAT PROVIDE BLANKET IMMUNITY

02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:22.459

AND FAIR LENDING ENFORCEMENT

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:28.666
THIS BLANKET IMMUNITY IS ALL THE

02:33:28.732 --> 02:33:31.168
MORE CONCERNING BECAUSE FINTECH --

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:33.537

02:33:35.339 --> 02:33:36.006
AND FOURTH -- SUSPENDING

SEVENTY ONE OF DODD FRANK

02:33:39.310 --> 02:33:41.011
SECTION TEN SEVENTY ONE REQUIRED

02:33:41.078 --> 02:33:42.613
THE CFPB TO IMPLEMENT SMALL

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.381
BUSINESS DATA COLLECTION AND TO

02:33:44.448 --> 02:33:45.749
MAKE THE DATA PUBLIC.

02:33:45.816 --> 02:33:47.117
NOTABLY IT REQUIRED THE

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:48.986
COLLECTION OF RACE AND GENDER OF

02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:50.387
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS.

02:33:50.454 --> 02:33:51.155
THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:52.122
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO

02:33:52.189 --> 02:33:53.424
COMPREHENSIVE SMALL BUSINESS

02:33:55.459 --> 02:33:56.927
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS RULE WAS

02:33:56.994 --> 02:33:57.962
CRITICAL BECAUSE IT IS WELL

02:33:58.028 --> 02:33:59.997
DOCUMENTED AS WELL THAT'S SMALL

STATEMENT SYSTEM CREDIT.

02:34:05.102 --> 02:34:06.503
IN CONCLUSION THESE ACTIONS WILL

02:34:06.570 --> 02:34:07.404
ONLY EXACERBATE THE RACIAL

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:08.973

02:34:12.843 --> 02:34:14.178
IN TERMS OF HOW CALIFORNIA CAN

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:23.153
TO SEE TEARS LIMON.

02:34:23.220 --> 02:34:24.588
LEADERSHIP IN EXPLORING HOW THE

02:34:24.655 --> 02:34:25.956
STE A STATE CAN STEP UP AND

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:27.391
PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO SEE

HIGH COST LENDING.

02:34:29.793 --> 02:34:30.928
I THINK THAT WHAT THIS

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:32.463
LEADERSHIP CALIFORNIA'S WELL

02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:34.598

NO IF WE CAN CALL IT THAT -- AND

02:34:51.782 --> 02:34:53.817
I THINK THAT INCLUDES THE BETTER

02:45:33.323 --> 02:45:35.692
STATE BANK NONETHELESS SEE WHAT

02:45:35.759 --> 02:45:37.894
GOES ON AROUND US AND IT'S STILL

02:45:37.961 --> 02:45:40.230
INCLUDES A PREPONDERANCE OF

02:45:40.297 --> 02:45:41.665
EXTRACTIVE PAYDAY LENDING.

02:45:41.731 --> 02:45:43.533
AUTO LOANS BANK PRODUCTS

02:45:43.600 --> 02:45:45.735

02:45:45.802 --> 02:45:47.404
MORTGAGE LENDING AND SMALL

02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:48.905
BUSINESS LENDING.

02:45:48.972 --> 02:45:50.206
AND FOR ALL OF THE SPEECHES

02:45:50.273 --> 02:45:52.008
CRIES OF OVER REGULATION AN

02:45:52.075 --> 02:45:53.977
AGENCY OVERLAP WE KNOW THAT

02:45:54.044 --> 02:45:55.879
EVERYONE IN AN INDUSTRY KNEW

02:45:55.945 --> 02:45:57.714
THAT WELLS FARGO WAS CROSS

02:45:57.781 --> 02:45:59.215
SELLING SIX TO EIGHT PRODUCTS.

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:01.117
PER CUSTOMER EVEN THOUGH WE

02:46:01.184 --> 02:46:03.386
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT FOR AND

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:04.688
IRONICALLY HELD UP AS BEST

02:46:04.754 --> 02:46:07.057
PRACTICES FOR A DECADE.

02:46:07.123 --> 02:46:08.958
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE CFPB JOINED

02:46:09.025 --> 02:46:10.627
FORCES WITH THE LOS ANGELES CITY

02:46:10.694 --> 02:46:12.662
ATTORNEY THAT JUSTICE WAS

02:46:12.729 --> 02:46:13.963
WROUGHT.

02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:15.565
IT IS NOW IT KNOWLEDGE WORLDWIDE

02:46:15.632 --> 02:46:18.168
THE TWIN PEAKS APPROACH TO BANK

02:46:18.234 --> 02:46:19.436
REGULATION IS NECESSARY.

02:46:19.502 --> 02:46:21.137
SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS REGULATORS

02:46:21.204 --> 02:46:22.706
HAVE AN INHERENT CONFLICT OF

02:46:22.772 --> 02:46:24.007
INTEREST HOLDING BANKS TO FULL

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:26.076
ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARD TO

02:46:26.142 --> 02:46:27.344
CREATE DID TREATMENT OF

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.712
CONSUMERS.

02:46:28.778 --> 02:46:30.213
WE CANNOT REALISTICALLY EXPECT

02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:31.481
THOSE SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.183
REGULATORS WHO OCCUPIED THREE

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:34.084
FLOORS OF THE BANK'S

02:46:34.150 --> 02:46:35.685
HEADQUARTERS ON A PERMANENT

02:46:35.752 --> 02:46:37.721
BASIS. TO HANDLE POTENTIAL

02:46:37.787 --> 02:46:39.856
CONSUMER OF USES WE NEED A

02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:41.224
SEPARATE CONSUMER FINANCE

02:46:41.291 --> 02:46:43.626
PROTECTION FORCE IN THE MIX.

02:46:43.693 --> 02:46:45.462
AND WITH THE FEDERAL CFPB

02:46:45.528 --> 02:46:47.464
EVISCERATED THAT LEAVES THE DUTY

02:46:47.530 --> 02:46:49.666
TO THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:46:49.733 --> 02:46:51.334
ESPECIALLY AS WE HEAD INTO

02:46:51.401 --> 02:46:53.136
ANOTHER DOWNTURN WE NEED TO

02:46:53.203 --> 02:46:54.371
CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION

02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:56.873
REGULATORY PRESENCE IT WOULD BE

02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:57.974
ESPECIALLY SALUTARY FOR

02:46:58.041 --> 02:47:00.377
CALIFORNIA AS A LARGE STATE.

02:47:00.443 --> 02:47:01.911
THE FIFTH BIGGEST ECONOMYIN THE

02:47:01.978 --> 02:47:04.147
WORLD AND HOME OF WELLS FARGO

02:47:04.214 --> 02:47:06.916
AND FOR THE VIRTUAL HOME OF BANK

02:47:06.983 --> 02:47:08.885
OF AMERICA.

02:47:08.952 --> 02:47:09.719
IN ITS GLORY DAYS THE FORMER

02:47:09.786 --> 02:47:11.855
FORMER FEDERAL CFPB RETURN

02:47:11.921 --> 02:47:12.956
TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION

02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:15.125
DOLLARS TO AMERICANS ABOUT ONE

02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:16.526
EIGHTH OF WHICH WOULD HAVE GONE

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:17.761
TO CALIFORNIANS.

02:47:17.827 --> 02:47:18.895
CREDIT CARD IMPROVEMENTS IN

02:47:18.962 --> 02:47:20.797
MORTGAGE MARKET CHANGES CONTINUE

02:47:20.864 --> 02:47:22.198
TO SAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH

02:47:22.265 --> 02:47:23.099
YEAR.

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:25.101
AND AVOIDING ANOTHER MELTDOWN IS

02:47:25.168 --> 02:47:26.636
PRICELESS.

02:47:26.703 --> 02:47:28.972
AND ALL OF THAT BENEFIT CAME AS

02:47:29.038 --> 02:47:31.174
SIGNIFICANT MULTIPLE OF WHAT HAD

02:47:31.241 --> 02:47:34.177
AT AS WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT BY THE

02:47:34.244 --> 02:47:36.646
CFPB.

02:47:36.713 --> 02:47:37.914
UNDER THIS FEDERAL

02:47:37.981 --> 02:47:39.449
ADMINISTRATION THE FOUR

02:47:39.516 --> 02:47:41.418
STATUTORY AREAS OVER WHICH THE

02:47:41.484 --> 02:47:43.119
CFPB HAD AUTHORITY HAVE BEEN

02:47:43.186 --> 02:47:45.755
SYSTEMATICALLY DISMANTLED OVER

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:47.457
STUDENT SENIOR MILITARY AND

02:47:47.524 --> 02:47:49.726
PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR

02:47:49.793 --> 02:47:51.528
THROUGH THE FAIR LENDING ACT.

02:47:51.594 --> 02:47:52.829
AND WE RECALL THAT BEFORE THE

02:47:52.896 --> 02:47:55.565
CFPB BANKS IN CALIFORNIA TRIED

02:47:55.632 --> 02:47:56.933
TO REST TO THIRTY FROM STATE

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.668
REGULATORS IN FAVOR OF FEDERAL

02:47:58.735 --> 02:47:59.769
CONSTRAINTS THEY COULD GET

02:47:59.836 --> 02:48:00.904
AROUND.

02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.972
THIS RESULTED IN LOTS OF FEDERAL

02:48:03.039 --> 02:48:04.808
PREEMPTION THAT THE CFPB THEN

02:48:04.874 --> 02:48:07.177
FINALLY HAD THE AUTHORITY TO

02:48:07.243 --> 02:48:08.645
REGULATE AND ENFORCE.

02:48:08.711 --> 02:48:09.712
LET US NOT ALLOW THE GREAT STATE

02:48:09.779 --> 02:48:11.181
OF CALIFORNIA TO TURN ITS BACK

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:12.615
ON ITS RESIDENTS WITH REGARD TO

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.284
CONSUMER PROTECTION.

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:15.819
AGAINST THE VERY BIGGEST BANKS

02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:17.654
AT UNDER PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES

02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:19.556
COMMIT FRAUD ON CONSUMERS LINDEN

02:48:19.622 --> 02:48:20.824
TO CLIMATE DISASTER AND

02:48:20.890 --> 02:48:22.459
FLAGRANTLY VIOLATE THEIR PUBLIC

02:48:22.525 --> 02:48:23.760
DUTIES.

02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:25.295
THE STAKES FOR OUR PEOPLE OUR

02:48:25.361 --> 02:48:27.730
COMMUNITIES OUR ECONOMY AND

02:48:27.797 --> 02:48:29.532
FINANCIAL TO THE STABILITY ARE

02:48:29.599 --> 02:48:31.067
TOO GREAT TO IGNORE.

02:48:31.134 --> 02:48:33.736
WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER WE ARE

02:48:33.803 --> 02:48:36.439
A BANK STAUNCHLY IN FAVOR OF A

02:48:36.506 --> 02:48:40.343
STATE CFPB THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:48:40.410 --> 02:48:41.010
THANK YOU THANK YOU TO ALL THREE

02:48:41.077 --> 02:48:43.413
OF YOU.

02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:45.081
A SUMMER STONE.

02:48:45.148 --> 02:48:46.416
IN THEM I AM VERY HAPPY THAT

02:48:46.483 --> 02:48:47.951
THERE'S A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

02:48:48.017 --> 02:48:49.285
WHO IS HERE ONE OF THE THINGS

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:50.420
THAT I HEAR.

02:48:50.487 --> 02:48:52.155
IN THE DISTRICT AS I TALK TO A

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:53.456
LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS IS FROM

02:48:53.523 --> 02:48:55.558
LOCAL BANKS THE SMALL CREDIT

02:48:55.625 --> 02:48:56.993
UNIONS AND SMALL LOCAL BANKS.

02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:58.228
AND WHAT THEY POINT OUT WHICH IS

02:48:58.294 --> 02:48:59.562
TRUE IS THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO

02:48:59.629 --> 02:49:01.397
LAND.

02:49:01.464 --> 02:49:02.699
IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE OTHERS

02:49:02.765 --> 02:49:04.334
ARE NOT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:05.668
COMMUNITY THEY UNDERSTAND THE

02:49:05.735 --> 02:49:08.204
RISKS THEY UNDERSTAND.

02:49:08.271 --> 02:49:10.173
HOW THOSE ECONOMIES AND WHERE

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:12.175
THOSE THE ECONOMIES ARE WORKING

02:49:12.242 --> 02:49:13.676
AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY ASKING?

02:49:13.743 --> 02:49:15.144
FOR A BIT OF A BREAK IN THE

02:49:15.211 --> 02:49:16.980
REGULATORY SCHEME BECAUSE IT'S

02:49:17.046 --> 02:49:18.114
DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:20.083
A LARGER BANK CERTAINLY HAS THE

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:21.751
CAPACITY BE ABLE TO MANAGE ALL

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:23.453
THE REGULATIONS AND AND SO WITH

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:25.688
SMALLER COMPANY SHOULD BUT BUT I

02:49:25.755 --> 02:49:27.156
THINK YOU RAISE.

02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:29.092
AN ISSUE THAT.

02:49:29.158 --> 02:49:30.193
THAT IS APPROPRIATE IT'S NOT

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.295
REALLY ABOUT DEREGULATING AND

02:49:32.362 --> 02:49:33.763
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SUGGESTING

02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:35.598
BUT IT'S RETHINKING HOW WE

02:49:35.665 --> 02:49:38.167
REGULATE AND IF WE CAN CREATE A

02:49:38.234 --> 02:49:39.936
STRUCTURE THAT HAS AND THIS IS

02:49:40.003 --> 02:49:41.738
WHAT TO ME IS SO COMPELLING

02:49:41.804 --> 02:49:43.606
ABOUT THIS. TWENTY SIX NOTION.

02:49:43.673 --> 02:49:45.041
THAT WE HAVE A BANK REGULATOR

02:49:45.108 --> 02:49:46.476
BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBLE

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:47.744
ORGANIZATION THAT'S LOOKING OUT

02:49:47.810 --> 02:49:49.412
ON THE CONSUMER SIDE WITH

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:50.880
APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF POWERS.

02:49:50.947 --> 02:49:52.649
THEN I THINK THAT GIVES US THE

02:49:52.715 --> 02:49:55.718
ABILITY TO RETHINK HOW WE MANAGE

02:49:55.785 --> 02:49:57.353
THE SMALLER BANKS TO GIVE THEM

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:58.588
THE ABILITY TO WORK WITHIN THE

02:49:58.655 --> 02:50:01.090
COMMUNITY AS THEY KNOW HOW TO DO.

02:50:01.157 --> 02:50:02.825
BUT HAVE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF

02:50:02.892 --> 02:50:05.028
OVERSIGHT TO KEEP. TO AVOID THE

02:50:05.094 --> 02:50:06.963
TEMPTATIONS THAT THAT LEAD THEM

02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:10.266
ASTRAY AND WE CAN THEN SEPARATE

02:50:10.333 --> 02:50:11.834
THEM AND ALLOW THEM TO COMPETE.

02:50:11.901 --> 02:50:13.269
IN THESE MARKETS WITH SOME OF

02:50:13.336 --> 02:50:14.871
THE LARGER BANKS THAT THAT HAVE

02:50:14.938 --> 02:50:17.974
OFTEN FAILED WHEN IT COMES.

02:50:18.041 --> 02:50:18.808
TO WHAT'S LEFT TO SELF

02:50:18.875 --> 02:50:20.343
REGULATION AND AND LACK OF

02:50:20.410 --> 02:50:21.444
OVERSIGHT FROM A FEDERAL LEVEL

02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:23.279
AND OF COURSE WE CAN'T AFFECT

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:24.714
FEDERAL LAW BUT WE CAN AFFECT

02:50:24.781 --> 02:50:25.982
AND CREATE STRUCTURES IN

02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:26.983
CALIFORNIA.

02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:28.017
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE STEPS

02:50:28.084 --> 02:50:29.686
THAT I THINK ARE POTENTIALLY

02:50:29.752 --> 02:50:31.220
VERY INTERESTING.

02:50:31.287 --> 02:50:31.988
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE A

02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:33.456
HEALTHIER CONVERSATION WITH SOME

02:50:33.523 --> 02:50:34.624
OF THE SMALLER FINANCIAL

02:50:34.691 --> 02:50:36.359
INSTITUTIONS WHO ARE REALLY

02:50:36.426 --> 02:50:38.261
TRYING TO MAKE THINGS WORK.

02:50:38.328 --> 02:50:40.830
IN THEIR OWN AREAS BUT WE NEED

02:50:40.897 --> 02:50:42.365
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:50:42.432 --> 02:50:44.000
APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF OVERSIGHT

02:50:44.067 --> 02:50:46.269
IN THOSE SITUATIONS -- FOR I

02:50:46.336 --> 02:50:47.804
THINK VERY OBVIOUS REASONS SO

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:48.771
THIS.

02:50:48.838 --> 02:50:51.274
THIS IS A VERY EXCITING I THINK

02:50:51.341 --> 02:50:53.076
STEP OR GIVES A SOME POTENTIAL

02:50:53.142 --> 02:50:54.978
TO RETHINK.

02:50:55.044 --> 02:50:56.646
HOW WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT WHAT

02:50:56.713 --> 02:50:58.114
WE'RE DOING WITH RESPECT TO

02:50:58.181 --> 02:50:59.148
PROTECTING?

02:50:59.215 --> 02:51:02.051
OUR OWN CONSUMERS IN THE STATE

02:51:02.118 --> 02:51:03.720
AND REALLY.

02:51:03.786 --> 02:51:05.888
COULD SPUR A A WHOLE NEW

02:51:05.955 --> 02:51:07.757
FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE THE

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:09.459
FINTECH THE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY

02:51:09.525 --> 02:51:10.860
THAT'S OUT THERE IS NOT

02:51:10.927 --> 02:51:12.061
SOMETHING TO BE AFRAID.

02:51:12.128 --> 02:51:13.129
BUT I THINK SOMETHING TO BRACE

02:51:13.196 --> 02:51:15.264
BECAUSE WE ALL ARE MOVING TO

02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:16.933
FINANCIAL TOOLS AND BANKING

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.202
RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE ONLINE

02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:21.137
THOSE AGAIN OUR OPPORTUNITIES

02:51:21.204 --> 02:51:22.672
BUT OPPORTUNITIES.

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:26.142
WITHOUT OVERSIGHT FOR OTHER WAYS

02:51:26.209 --> 02:51:27.644
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS

02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:28.811
SOPHISTICATED TO GET INTO SOME

02:51:28.878 --> 02:51:30.780
SIGNIFICANT TROUBLE THAT SHOULD

02:51:30.847 --> 02:51:32.115
BE OUR CHARGE IS.

02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:33.683
TO PROVIDE THAT FRAMEWORK THAT

02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:36.185
LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT AND BE ABLE

02:51:36.252 --> 02:51:37.654
TO TEST IT AND THEN.

02:51:37.720 --> 02:51:39.155
INTEGRATIVE NEW BANKS WITH NEW

02:51:39.222 --> 02:51:40.423
STANDARDS CAN COME FORWARD

02:51:40.490 --> 02:51:41.958
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES CAN COME

02:51:42.025 --> 02:51:44.260
FORWARD AND WE HAVE A VENUE TO

02:51:44.327 --> 02:51:44.694
HAVE THE APPROPRIATE

02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:46.362
CONVERSATIONS RATHER THAN BEING

02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:48.364
STUCK IN AN OLD REGULATORY

02:51:48.431 --> 02:51:48.865
SCHEME.

02:51:48.931 --> 02:51:50.433
WITHOUT THAT HAVING THE

02:51:50.500 --> 02:51:52.101
FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW SOME OF

02:51:52.168 --> 02:51:53.770
THESE ADVANCES TO COME FORWARD
