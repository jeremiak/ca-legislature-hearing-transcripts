THAT GERMANS STARTED COMING TO AMERICA. FROM JAMES TOWN ON AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED GREATLY. TO THE COUNTRY. TODAY OVER FORTY TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION GERMANS ARE IN AMERICA. AND SIX MILLION IN CALIFORNIA. NOW WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT THIS AND ALSO ANY OTHER IN MAY GE IMMIGRANT GROUP. IS. PEOPLE SAY THAT AMERICA IS A MELTING POT. I BELIEVE. MY OPINION THAT AMERICA IS LIKE A SALAD A BEAUTIFUL SALAD MADE UP OF ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT WONDERFUL THINGS. AND IF THERE IS A MELTING POT ITS DNA. AND OUR WHOLE. POPULATION IS MADE UP OF INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENT DNA FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THERE IS NO OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD THAT REPRESENTS THE WORLD THEN US. SO. WITH THAT IN MIND AND. STE AS FAR AS GUMP WOULD SAY SO MUCH FOR THAT. SO THIS MONTH WILL BE GERMAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH ANDI'M PROUD TO RECOGNIZE THE GERMAN CONSULATE AND- THE DNA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER VOEPEL MS BURNER LEAVE A CLICK AND THEN CLICKING IN ALL IS STAY AWAY TO MASUDI DEUTSCHE AMERICANA SHOULD TODD THE CLUB WAS SERVICE TICKET CLEAR BUT I CAN IS TO DO MUCH AMERICA SHOULD TARGET IN TODD SOME MONEY CAN APPLY TO DO TO WATCH ON THE AMERICANA CHART.

THANK YOU MISTER PATEL THE AUTHOR IS REQUESTING CO AUTHORS ON THE RESOLUTION THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE. MEMBERS THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS. THIS IS FOR CO AUTHORS ON H. R. AIDS. CLICK WELL. CLOSER ROLE THERE ARE SEVENTY CO AUTHORS ADDED WITHOUT OBJECTION WE MAY TAKE A VOICE VOTE ON THE RESOLUTION ALL THOSE IN FAVOR SAY AYE. AYE OPPOSED SAY NAY. THE AYES HAVE IT THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. MEMBERS THIS IS FILE ITEM THIRTY SIX ACR ONE FIFTEEN. QUICKLY. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE FIFTEEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER-DOVE KAMLAGER-DOVE RELATIVE TO GRANULATED BUSINESS. MS KAMLAGER-DOVE IF YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I AM HERE TO PRESENT ACR ONE FIFTEEN WHICH URGES THE SIX BANKS THAT HAVE OPENED DEMAND ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO RECONSIDER THEIR LENDING PRACTICES AND STOP LENDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. THERE IS POWER IN LEVERAGING MONEY SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE GROWING FURY AROUND THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC IN AMERICA. AND BANKS HAVE POWER. THEY USE THEIR POWER TO DIVEST FROM SOUTH AFRICA IN OPPOSITION TO APARTHEID MANY NO LONGER FINANCE PRIVATE PRISONS AND THEY WILLINGLY DECLINE TO LYNN TO ROGUE NATIONS WITH ON DEMOCRATIC INTENTIONS LET'S ASK THEM TO USE THEIR POWER TO HELP STOP MORE INNOCENCE FROM BECOMING VICTIMS OF MASS SHOOTINGS. PUBLIC DISCOURSE REGARDING GUN VIOLENCE OFTEN LOOKS TO THE DEMAND FACTOR THIS RESOLUTION AIMS TO SHIFT THAT DISCOURSE INSTEAD TO THE SUPPLY FACTOR. THE SUPPLY OF GUNS CURRENTLY EXCEEDS THE DEMAND GUNS 10% OF THOSE GUN OWNERS GUN OWNERS OWN OVER TEN GUNS. MENTAL ILLNESS VIDEO GAMES AND THE INTERNET ARE ALL COMMONLY CITED AS THE SOURCE OF GUN VIOLENCE HOWEVER OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH CAñADA HAS ALL OF THESE THINGS BUT FAR LESS GUN VIOLENCE THE DIFFERENCE THEY HAVE FEWER GUNS. OTHER INDUSTRIES HAVE TAKEN A STAND AGAINST GUN MANUFACTURERS DELTA AIRLINES AND HURTS BROKE WITH THE NRA FOLLOWING THE PARK LAND SHOOTING AND DICK'S SPORTING GUNS MAY DICK'S SPORTING GOODS MADE GUNS HARDER TO BUY. CERTAIN BANKS HAVE ALREADY TAKEN SIMILAR ACTION TO THAT WHICH IS CALLED FOR AN ACR ONE FIFTEEN FOR INSTANCE CITY BANK BAND RETAILERS THAT USE THE BANK FROM OFFERING BUMP STOPS. AND SELLING GUNS TO UNDERAGE CUSTOMERS OR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT PASSED BACKGROUND CHECKS BANK OF AMERICA THEN CAME OUT WITH ITS OWN SET OF RESTRICTIONS ENDING LOANS TO COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE ADULT STYLE WEAPONS USED FOR NON MILITARY PURPOSES. MANY BANKS ARGUE THAT DEMANDING SUCH DIVESTMENT ACTION IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED AND THAT BANKS SHOULD BE FREE FROM POLITICAL PRESSURE. BUT PROTECTING THE LIVES OF AMERICANS SHOULD BE ABOUT BIPARTISAN IF NOT ENTIRELY A NON POLITICAL ISSUE. THIS RESOLUTIONDOES NOT DEMAND THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS HOPE PRODUCTION IT DOES NOT ASK CIVILIANS TO STOP PURCHASING GUNS THIS IS NOT A SECOND AMENDMENT BILL. THIS IS NOT A DIVESTMENT BILL. THIS RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES THOSE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH OPEN DEMAND ACCOUNTS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REEVALUATE THEIR LENDING PRACTICES PARTICULARLY AS THEY APPLIED TO GUN MANUFACTURERS. IT ASKS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO DO AS WE ALL SHOULD WHICH IS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PART WE PLAY IN A CONTINUALLY GROWING NATIONAL PROBLEM AND TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR TO REFLECT OUR VISION FOR A SAFER FUTURE. OUR COUNTRY IS FACING A MULTI PRONGED SICKNESS. AND WE NEED MULTI STRATEGY SOLUTIONS. WE MUST ALL TAKE A LOOK AT OUR HABITS OUR PRACTICES AND OUR EFFORTS TO SEE HOW WE SHARE A PART OF THE COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC INCLUDING OUR BANKS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THERE WAS KAMLAGER-DOVE MS MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THIS BILL IS EXTORTION THIS BILL. SAYS THAT IT ONCE AGAIN MANUFACTURES A RETAILER TO ADOPT LENDING PRACTICES THAT NEAR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA'S VALUES YET NO DEFINITION IS GIVEN OF THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IT SITE CITY BANK. THAT SERVED AS AN EXAMPLE ARE FOR GUN POLICIES BY ADOPTING A POLICY PROHIBITING THE SALES OF FIREARMS BY ITS BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO INDIVIDUALS YOUNGER THAN TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD THERE ARE A LOT OF STATES WHO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE YOUNGER THAN TWENTY ONE TO PURCHASE. A RIFLE. BUT CALIFORNIA IS NOW GOING TO TRY TO IMPOSE ITS GUN CONTROL MEASURES ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BY THREATENING THE BANKS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS A THREAT. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES THE AUTHOR TELLS YOU THIS BILL DOESN'T FORCE THEM TO DO ANYTHING IF YOU READ THE RESOLUTION IT IS PRETTY CLEAR WHAT THE MESSAGES THAT LISTED THERE HOW MUCH MONEY. IS INVESTED WITH THEIR HELP WITH THESE BANKS FOR CAL STARS IN CALPERS. IT'S A LOT OF MONEY. AND THE VEILED THREAT OR THINLY VEILED THREAT FRANKLY IS IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO DO REGARDING GUN RIGHTS THEN YOU WON'T GET OUR BUSINESS AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY SO WE WANT YOU GOT MANY FACTORS AGAIN RETAILERS TO IMPOSE. OUR WILL ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND I WILL REMIND YOU THAT ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE MENTION IN THIS RESOLUTION. ABOUT EXEMPTING WEAPONS FOR MILITARY USE THERE IS NO MENTION IN HERE OF WEAPONS THAT ARE USED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO YOU TELL ME THIS IF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WANTS TO PUSH ALL OF THESE BANKS BIG BANK SIX MAJOR BANKS WANT TO PUSH THESE BANKS NATIONWIDE TO NOT PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES TOO MANY FACTORS AND RETAILERS OF FIREARMS. THEN WHO WHO WILL MAKE THEM WHERE WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT GET THE ONE TOOL THAT THEY NEED. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES OR YOU. WHERE WILL THEY GET THEM. BECAUSE MY COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT THEY PURCHASE THEIR OWN WEAPONS. AND THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT DO THE SAME. SO IF YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OBTAIN THESE FAR ARMS WHAT EXACTLY ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION IN COMMITTEE WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD. IF YOU DON'T MIND. I ASK THIS QUESTION IN COMMITTEE WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD IS THE GOAL TO PUT GUN MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS OUT OF BUSINESS OR TO PUT THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH WHICH TO DO BUSINESS AND THE ANSWER WAS THAT'S ONE. OF THE GOALS. SAID THAT IS THE GOAL OF THIS IN CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A PRETTY BIG STICK WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. WITH A BIG ECONOMY. BUT IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO IMPOSE ITS IDEALS ON A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. THAT IS IN OUR JOB IF WHAT'S NEXT SO YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WELL WE DON'T WANT BANKS DOING BUSINESS WITH SODA MANUFACTURERS WE DON'T WANT YOU DOING BUSINESS WITH OIL MANUFACTURERS ARE ORDERED FIRST. FUEL. FEEL COMPANIES WHAT LIKE HOW FAR DO WE GO HERE. THIS IS NOT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE'S JOB. TO DECIDE TO PUSH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY AND PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO IMPOSE THE GUN CONTROL MEASURES THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THE FOUNDATION OF DEMOCRACY STARTS WITH THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN. IT IS SAID THAT WE LEARN FIRST WHEN WE ARE TAUGHT AND THEN AGAIN WHEN WE TEACH WHAT WE KNOW TO OTHERS. IT IS THE CIVIC MISSION OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO PREPARE ALL YOU YOUNG PEOPLE TO BE INFORMED RESPONSIBLE AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN CIVIC LIFE. ACR EIGHTY SEVEN COMMEMORATES THE CORNERSTONE ROLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS PLAY IN SUSTAINING AND PRESERVING DEMOCRACY THAT WE PLEDGE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AS THEY ARE PLEDGE TO BUILDING A BETTER SOCIETY FOR ALL TO LIVE IN. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THAT THE FIRST ROLE BE OPEN FOR CO AUTHORS. THANK YOU MS QUIRK SILVA MISTER KILEY HERE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I A REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA TASK FORCE ON K. TWELVE CIVIC LEARNING HIGHLIGHTS A NUMBER OF CONCERNING FRIENDS INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES RANKS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE. IN VOTER PARTICIPATION IN THE WORLD JUST 13% OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA SHOW A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF U. S. HISTORY LESS THAN HALF OF OUR SENIORS FEEL A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED. IN STATE AND LOCAL ISSUES. NATION WIDE SURVEYS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT CIVIC KNOWLEDGE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND TRUST IN GOVERNMENT ARE AT AN ALL TIME LOW. ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EIGHTY SEVEN IS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARDS REVERSING THESE TRENDS IN OUR STATE. THE PROMISE OF CIVICS IS THAT A CENTRAL PURPOSE OF EDUCATION IS TO PREPARE FOR THE ROLE OF CITIZENS. AND IN A TIME OF GROWING POLITICAL DIVISION AND WOMAN POLICY CHALLENGES THAT ROLE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. A RENEWED FOCUS ON CIVIC EDUCATION CAN UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF EVERY YOUNG PERSON TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN OUR SHARED PUBLIC LIFE. ASSURING THAT THE NEXT GENERATION IS EQUIPPED TO RENEW AND REINVIGORATE OUR DEMOCRATIC TRADITIONS. THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR LEARNING AND CIVIC EDUCATION LAYS OUT A NUMBER OF PROVEN PRACTICES FOR EFFECTIVE CIVIC LEARNING. INCLUDING PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION IN GOVERNMENT HISTORY LAW AND DEMOCRACY INCORPORATING DISCUSSION OF CURRENT LOCAL NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES AND EVENTS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND OFFERING EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES THE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND THEIR COMMUNITIES. RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WHO KNOW MORE ABOUT GOVERNMENT ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE DISCUSS POLITICS CONTACT THEIR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND TAKE PART IN OTHER CIVIC ACTIVITIES AND THAT CIVIC INVOLVEMENT EARLY IN LIFE CAN TRANSLATE INTO GREATER PARTICIPATION. AS AN ADULT. I ASPIRIN AYE VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION AND HOPE THAT OUR LEGISLATURE ALONG WITH GOVERNING BODIES AND CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CAN HEAT ITS CALL FOR A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO CIVICS EDUCATION IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THANK YOU MISS KILEY. SEEN NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON THE RESOLUTION IS QUIRK SILVA YOU MAY CLOSE IF YOU WISH.

HOUSE RESOLUTION FIFTY ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AND OTHERS REALTORS A BLACK WOMAN EQUAL PAY DAY. THIS KAMLAGER-DOVE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT HR FIFTY ONE IN HONOR OF BLACK WOMEN'S EQUAL PAY DAY. NEARLY FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE FEDERAL EQUAL PAY ACT WOMEN ARE STILL FIGHTING TO GET EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK WE RECOGNIZE WOMEN'S EQUAL PAY DAY IN APRIL BECAUSE IT MARKS THE TIME WHEN WOMEN ON AVERAGE. CATCH UP TO THE WAGES PAID TO MEN FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. BUT GROUPING ALL WOMEN TOGETHER CAN BE MISLEADING WOMEN OF COLOR SUFFER THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCES FROM PAY DISCRIMINATION. WHILE THE AVERAGE WOMAN MAKES EIGHTY CENTS TO EVERY DOLLAR A MAN EARNS BLACK WOMEN ONLY MAKE ABOUT SIXTY ONE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. BLACK WOMEN'S EQUAL PAY DAY IS ON AUGUST TWENTY SECOND BECAUSE IT MAY TAKES BLACK WOMEN ON AVERAGE EIGHT MONTHS TO CATCH UP WITH THE EARNINGS OF MEN FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. BREAD WINNERS WE REPRESENT 53% OF THE BLACK LABOR FORCE BLACK WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES HAVE SURGED BY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR PERCENT. AND WE ARE THE MOST EDUCATED GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES WITH WOMEN MAKING UP 64% OF BLACK STUDENTS WHO EARNED BACHELOR'S DEGREES. AND YET TODAY MILLIONS OF BLACK WOMEN IN OUR FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO GET BY. A LIFETIME OF LOWER PAY MEANS THAT BLACK WOMEN HAVE LESS INCOME TO SAVE FOR OUR EDUCATION OUR FAMILIES AND RETIREMENT. OVER A FORTY YEAR CAREER WOMEN OVER ALL LOSE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AS A RESULT OF THE WAGE GAP WITH WOMEN OF COLOR LOSING ALMOST NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OUR HARD WORK IS UNDERVALUED SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN. SLAVERY AND JIM CROW PERIODS CHARACTERIZED BY THE EXPLOITATION OF BLACK WOMEN'S PHYSICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE LABOR SHAPED LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES FOR BLACK WOMEN FOR DECADES IN THE THIRTIES BLACK WOMEN WERE PRIMARILY EMPLOYED AS AGRICULTURE AND DOMESTIC WORKERS AND AS LABOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES MATERIALIZED FOR SOME WOMEN. RULES WERE ADAPTED TO ENSURE THE DYNAMIC REMAINED THE SAME LIKE THE PRACTICE OF TIPPING WHICH EMERGED IN RESISTANCE TO BLACK WORKERS MOVING INTO FORMAL EMPLOYMENT AND WAS USED TO AVOID PLAYING PAYING BLACK AMERICANS FOR THEIR LABOR. THE NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT TRANSFORM THE LABOR MARKET FOR SO MANY WHITE WORKERS AND YET ALL EXCLUDED DOMESTIC AN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS FROM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS A NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE AND A FORTY HOUR WORK WEEK. TO NAME A FEW OF THE MANY PROTECTIONS DENIED BLACK WOMEN WORKERS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS CONVENE THE PAY EQUITY TASK FORCE TO FORM BEST PRACTICES IN CLOSING THE PAY GAP. THE COMMISSION FOUND THAT EQUITABLE PAY POLICIES CAN BE IMPLEMENTED SIMPLY AND WITHOUT UNDUE COSTS IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. THE RACE AND GENDER PAY GAP IS NOT A BUG IN AMERICA'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM IT'S A PRIME FEATURE. WE MUST PERSIST IN ADDRESSING THESE DISPARITIES NOT ONLY FOR BLACK WOMEN IN OUR FAMILIES BUT FOR OUR SOCIETY AT LARGE FAIR PAY ENHANCES THE ECONOMY AND REDUCES THE NEED FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY NET. WE WILL ALL BENEFIT WHEN EVERY CALIFORNIAN RECEIVES JUST AND EQUAL PAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR FIFTY ONE. THINGS KAMLAGER-DOVE MISS THEM ON YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY I AM PROUD SUPPORT OF HR FIFTY ONE AUTHORED BY THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO AND PRESENTED. BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AS HAS BEEN STATED WE AS WOMEN HAVE FOUGHT FOR DECADES TO BE PAID FAIRLY AND EQUALLY FOR THE WORK WE DO. AND YET THIS FIGHT AND SOME OF THE GAINES WITNESSED ARE NOT EQUALLY AMONGST ALL WOMEN IN THE WORLD. WHEN A BLACK WOMEN EARN SIXTY ONE CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN COMPARISON TO THEIR WHITE MALE COLLEAGUE FOR THE SAME JOB. WE MUST TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON WHAT THAT MEANS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. AND HOW MUCH WORK REMAINS TO BE DONE. A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AUTHORED THE TOUGHEST PAY EQUITY BILL IN THE NATION AND THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS CONVENE THE PAY EQUITY TASK FORCE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR MEANINGFUL COMPLIANCE. TO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE FAIR PAY ACT IN CALIFORNIA. FOR NEARLY TWO AND A HALF YEARS INDUSTRY AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WORK TO CRAFT RESOURCES AND GUIDANCE. FOR EMPLOYERS WHO SEEK TO ENSURE PAY EQUITY WITHIN THEIR COMPANIES AND TO ENSURE EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND THERE RIGHT. THE COMMISSION LAUNCHED HASHTAG EQUAL PAY CALIFORNIA AS A JOINT PROJECT OF THE COMMISSION AND THE FIRST PARTNER. THIS YEAR AND HAS ALREADY SEEN THIRTY CALIFORNIA BASED CORPORATION SIGN ON TO THE EQUAL PAY PLEDGE. ALL OF THIS WORK IS IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL BUT WE CAN ONLY MOVE FORWARD AS WOMEN WHEN EVERY WOMAN IS CONSIDERED I AM THANKFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THAT HAVE. ALLOWED US TO HELP RAISE THIS AWARENESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS AMONG. THE SCENE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

NINETY NINE YEARS AGO WOMEN WERE GRANTED EQUAL VOTING RIGHTS THROUGH THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT.

HOWEVER DESPITE THE MANY EFFORTS OF POLICY MAKERS AND ADVOCATES TOWARD ENSURING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN GENDER INEQUALITY STILL PERSISTS IN MANY AREAS WE ARE STILL WORKING TO ENSURE FAIR PAY. AND EQUAL JOB OPPORTUNITIES ACCESS TO CHILDCARE AND FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACES. WE CELEBRATE WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY EVERY YEAR ON AUGUST TWENTY SIX AS A SYMBOL OF THE CONTINUED FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL CITIZENS. JOIN US TODAY IN RECOGNIZING AUGUST TWENTY SIX AS WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY TO CELEBRATE THE NINETY NINTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT AND IT'S A STARK IMPORTANCE TO WOMEN'S RIGHTS IN THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE.

THIS WAS THE CULMINATION OF A MASSIVE PEACEFUL CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT BY WOMEN FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN THAT HAD ITS FORMAL BEGINNINGS IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT AT THE WORLD'S FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS CONVENTION. IN SENECA FALLS IT TOOK SEVENTY TWO YEARS FROM THAT BEGINNING TO FINALLY EARNED THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING SB TWO TWENTY THREE JUDGES ACT ON BEHALF OF SENATOR HEALTH AS A FOLLOW UP TO SB ELEVEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH PASSED OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE LAST SESSION. THIS MEASURE WILL HELP STUDENTS WITH SEVERE MEDICAL DISABILITIES SUCH AS AN EPILEPSY OR OTHER SEIZURE SEIZURE DISORDERS TO ATTEND SCHOOL. THE ONLY MEDICATION THAT WORKS FOR SOME OF THESE STUDENTS IS MEDICAL CANNABIS. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW A PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO COME ONTO CAMPUS TO ADMINISTER MEDICAL CANNABIS TO THEM. IN NON SMOKING AND NON PEIPING FORMS. MANY OF THESE STUDENTS NEED TO TAKE A DOSE OF MEDICAL CANNOT CANNABIS AT REGULAR INTERVALS WHICH OFTEN OCCUR DURING SCHOOL HOURS. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT ALLOW ANY FORM OF CANNABIS ON SCHOOL GROUNDS THESE STUDENTS MUST BE PICKED UP BY THEIR PARENTS AND TAKING ONE THOUSAND FEET OFF CAMPUS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THEIR TREATMENT DOES WHICH IS OFTEN VERY DISRUPTIVE TO THEIR LEARNING AND RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT. OF LOS CLASS TIME. SB TWO TO THREE WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION OR CHARTER SCHOOL TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO ADOPT THIS POLICY. IT IS NOT A STATE MANDATE. DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES THAT OFTEN CAN OPT OUT FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING IF FEDERAL FUNDING IS PUT AT RISK AS A RESULT OF THIS POLICY. SB TWO TO THREE REQUIRES THE STUDENT TO BE A QUALIFIED MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT WITH A DOCTOR'S RECOMMENDATION. TYPICALLY THEY ADMIT THE MEDICINE IS ADMINISTERED BY A PARENT AS OIL CAPSULES TEACHERS LIQUIDS OR TOPICAL CREAMS. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT A PARENT MUST GIVE THE SCHOOL A COPY OF THEIR CHILD'S MEDICAL CANNABIS RECOMMENDATIONS TO KEEP ON FILE. SIGN IN WHEN THEY COME ON CAMPUS NOT DISRUPT THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND TAKE ALL CANNABIS FROM SCHOOL GROUNDS AFTER ADMINISTRATION. WASHINGTON COLORADO FLORIDA MAINE NEW JERSEY AND NEW MEXICO HAVE ALL PASSED LEGISLATION ALLOWING STUDENTS TO USE MEDICAL CANNABIS ON CAMPUSES. THIS BILL ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU MISS WITH MS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. HI I RISE IN AND FORTUNATE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I DID VOTE FOR IT. IN JUDICIARY FOR HOPES OF THINGS BEING FIGURED OUT THAT'S A SECOND YEAR I'VE KIND OF DONE THIS DANCE WITH WITH SENATOR FROM. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SAN MATTEO SAN MATTEO I'M SORRY SIR. MY CONCERN IS THIS IN AYE AYE AYE I'M TORN I REALLY KIND OF WANT THIS BILL TO PASS BECAUSE THE FAMILIES WHO PRESENTED THEIR STORIES IT WAS SO COMPELLING AND ARE ACTING VERY RESPONSIBLY AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH PEDIATRICIANS AND SPECIALIST ON THE DOSAGE AND IN THESE FAMILIES ARE ARE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT NAY OF COURSE UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL IN MINISTER IT. MY PROBLEM IS THIS IN ONE I'M GONNA BRING UP ON THIS FLOOR IN SUGGEST WE LOOK AT FIGURING OUT A WAY TO FIX THIS THE MEDICINAL PROCESS FOR CHILDREN IS NOT WELL DEFINED YOU JUST NEED TO GET THEM A CARD THERE IS NOTHING ARE STATURE LAW THAT REQUIRES A PARENT TO BE WORKING WITH THE SPECIALIST TO BE WORKING WITH A PEDIATRICIAN FOR THE EXACT DOSAGE AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS WITH YOU MAY AND PUTTING THEIR THEIR MEMBERS AT RISK. IN AND KIND OF FORMALIZING THAT RELATIONSHIP BUT IT DOES WORRY ME THAT WERE ALLOWING FOR THE THAT THE MEDICATION OF CHILDREN REALLY TO BE DETERMINED BY THEIR PARENTS WHICH SOME PEOPLE MIGHT FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT I THINK THERE IS POSSIBILITY FOR ABUSE AND SO FOR THAT REASON I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO AT IT ESPECIALLY SO MANY OF YOU WORK ON CANNABIS ISSUES IN AND HAVE A STRONGER BACKGROUND AND MEDICINAL MARIJUANA. BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO IF WE'RE GOING TO TRULY TREAT IT LIKE A MEDICINE AND WE BELIEVE IN ALL THE GREAT THINGS THEY CAN DO AND I FOR ONE DO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE START TO HAVE SOME STANDARDS AND. GUIDELINES BY WHICH WE MEDICAID CHILDREN. THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ. MR MURATSUCHI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I. ALSO WANTED TO EXPRESS MY MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THIS BILL YOU KNOW GENERALLY I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF. MEDICINAL MARIJUANA. HOWEVER THIS BILL IS OPPOSED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND ACCORDING TO THEIR OPPOSITION THERE INDICATING THAT. ONE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S TOP PRIORITIES IS TO PREVENT ANY YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE FROM ACCESSING ANYTHING ALL TYPES OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS. YOU KNOW I FEEL THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE. SITUATIONS WHERE. IN A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS. MAY WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS HOWEVER IN AS A PARENT I FEEL THAT THIS IS CROSSING WHAT SHOULD BE A BRIGHT LINE IN KEEPING. MARIJUANA CANNABIS PRODUCTS OUT OF OUR SCHOOLS NOW I UNDERSTAND WE LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD I GREW UP IN SCHOOLS WHERE THERE WERE PLENTY OF CANNABIS PRODUCTS. AT AT MY SCHOOLS BUT- IT CONCERNS ME THAT THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE- LEGALIZED MARIJUANA. WE DID IT WITH THE COMMITMENT TO HAVE BRIGHT LINES A TO KEEP IT AWAY FROM KIDS AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS IS CROSSING THAT LINE. DR CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER IN THE MEMBERS SIDE RISE SAW IN OPPOSITION IN OPPOSITION OF A AS PER YEAR A TOTAL WITH THREE. WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE COMPASSIONATE TO USE ACT OF A NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHICH ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE SOME MEDICINE ON A CANNABIS ILLEGALLY. DUE TO THE FEDERAL LAW THIS BILL IS SUCH A VIOLATION OF OUR DRUG FREE SCHOOL ZONE ACT WHICH IS STRIVES TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS DRUG FREE. WHILE I AGREE THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE IN NEED OF A MEDICINAL CANNABIS WE MUST ALSO THINK OF THOSE SO CHILDREN NOT PRESCRIBE THE MEDICINE OR CANNABIS. THAT ARE AFFECTED THE THROUGH A SECOND THAT THE SMALL. I AGREE THAT THE WE NEED TO ORG ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ABOUT THAT WE MUST DO IT. IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE OLDER CHILDREN. WHO WILL BE OUR PRESENT THOUGHT WAS SCHOOR CAMPUSES. FOR THIS REASON SAW I RESPECT TO BE ASKING FOR YOU AT NO FAULT THANK YOU. MS Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; YOUR&lt;/c&gt;</u> RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER BUT AS ALSO WHO HAS HAD. AND WATCHED AS STUDENT IN THE CLASSROOM GET A SEIZURE. AND KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT ACCESS ON MEDICATION BECAUSE OF WHAT THE MEDICATION IS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT THE BILL ONLY ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE THAT DECISION IN MOST. IN MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS POLICIES ARE ALREADY ESTABLISHED THAT ANY DRUG. THAT IS STUDENT NEEDS INCLUDING TYLENOL SHOULD BE WITH THE NURSES OFFICE OR SHOULD BE IN AN OFFICE THAT CAN ADMINISTER THE THIS. THOUSAND FEET FROM THE SCHOOL SITE IS VERY FAR FOR SOME CAMPUSES AND IT DOES NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME I ASKED THAT WE ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAKE THIS IN THIS DECISION THEMSELVES. AND ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT STUDENTS FOR DIFFERENT REASONS HAVE MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT THIS CAN AID IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BE IN A CLASSROOM. AND WATCHES STUDENT GO THREE SEIZURE. AND NOT BE ABLE TO HELP THAT STUDENT IMMEDIATELY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE DOCTOR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE IN SUPPORT THEM ALSO A CO AUTHOR AN SP TWO TO THREE I WILL POINT OUT THAT THE BILL SAYS THERE HAS TO BE A MEDICAL RECOMMENDATION. AND I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT CMA A CNA AND OTHER MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT OPPOSED C. B. D. IN PARTICULAR WHICH IS ONE OF THE- A COMPOUND IT'S- OF MARIJUANA HAS BEEN FOUND. TO HELP MANY CHILDREN WITH SEIZURES AND SO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. THAT THEY GET ACCESS TO THIS AND- THE WORLD ISN'T PERFECT WE NEED THE. FEDS TO TAKE THEIR HEADS OUT OF THE SAND SO DOCTORS DON'T FEEL IF THEY RECOMMEND C. B. D. FOR SEIZURE. SEIZURE THAT THEY COULD BE AT PROSECUTED BY THE FEDS RIGHT NOW IT'S A YEAR TO YEAR THING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR LICENSE SO WE NEED FOR SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS I BELIEVE IN THIS IMPERFECT WORLD THERE ARE A NOT FOR. WELL I WOULD SAY. WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN AND WE HAVE TO PREVENT THOSE SEIZURES THANK YOU. THEY GET A QUIRK DOCTOR WOULD RECOGNIZE THANK MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL YOU MAY OR MAY NOT REMEMBER LAST YEAR WE PASSED A BILL. THAT WOULD CHANGE THE COULD CALVET THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT FOR A MEDICATION CALLED AT THE DIALECTS SHOULD THE FTA ACTUALLY APPROVE THAT WHICH THEY DID AFTER OUR SESSION ENDED LAST YEAR NO EPIC DIALECTS IS A CANNABIS MEDICATION FOR SEIZURES IT IS FORCE VERY SEVERE SEIZURES IN CHILDREN AND SO THERE IS A RECOGNIZED MEDICAL USE FOR THIS AND I THINK THAT THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO THAT WE DO NEED. ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES WITH REGARDS TO CHILDREN BUT THERE IS IN MY MIND NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT WITH CHILDREN WITH SEIZURES AND I SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. SEE NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION DEBATE ON THE ITEM IS SMITH YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YEAR AND THEY GET MY COLLEAGUES OR YOUR YOUR RESPECTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THIS MEASURE PARTICULARLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO BRINGS UP A VERY GOOD POINT. OF COURSE WE NEED ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD PARTICULARLY IF THIS PROVES AS IT HAS FOR SO MANY FAMILIES ALREADY TO BE A THERAPY THAT IS VERY PRACTICABLE FOR OUR OUR STATE'S CHILDREN. BECAUSE AS ANY OF US WHO ARE HERE WHO ARE PARENTS KNOW RATHER THAN HAVE YOUR CHILD GO THROUGH A LITANY OF TESTING WITH ANTI PSYCHOTIC MAGIC MEDICATION OR PSYCHIATRIC OPTIONS. IF YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT IS AS USABLE AND AS AVAILABLE AS CB DE AND SOME OF THE CANNABIS RELATED PRODUCTS ARE NOW AND IT'S SUCCESSFUL IN KEEPING YOUR CHILD IN THE STATE WHERE THEY'RE NOT HAVING SEIZURES. ANY PARENT IS GOING TO CHOOSE THAT OPTION TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA SHE AND I ARE BOTH SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION AND THEY STAND IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AS IT WILL EMPOWER THEM TO BE MAKING DECISIONS. AT A LOCAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO HELP OUT THE FAMILIES THAT THEY SERVE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SMITH AND WITHOUT THE CLERK WILL OPEN THE ROLE.

MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE TO ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR HOUSE RESOLUTION FIFTY HONORING CHIEF CLERK DOTSON WILSON ON HIS RETIREMENT. I HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THE FIRST TIME I MADE A BILL PRESENTATION ON THE FLOOR I ASK DOTS AND FOR HIS HONEST FEEDBACK AFTERWARDS AND HE'S- SAID I HADN'T BEEN FULLY PREPARED. SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M THAT I GET THIS ONE THAT I GET THIS ONE RIGHT. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US ARE FULLY PREPARED FOR DOTSON WILSON'S RETIREMENT AS CHIEF CLERK. HAVING PRESIDED HERE FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS HE IS AN INSTITUTION WITHIN OUR INSTITUTION. IT IS MY JOB TO SPEAKER TO TALK TO A NEWLY ELECTED OFFICIALS AND I'VE- HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH A GOOD HALF OF YOU. AND YOU OFTEN ASK ME WHAT ADVICE YOU NEED TO SUCCEED I ALWAYS TELL YOU TO GIVE DOTS ON A CALL. AND TO SPEND TIME WITH HIM. AND HE'S GOING TO WANT TO CHANGE HIS CELL NUMBER BECAUSE I'M GONNA KEEP TELLING. EACH CLASS THAT COMES IN HERE. FOR AS LONG AS I'M HERE TO CONTINUE TO CALL. TO GET DOTS IN A CALL. THE THING EVERYONE WILL TELL YOU ABOUT DOTSON IS THAT HE KNOWS EVERYTHING THAT GOES ON UNDER THE DOME. IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS HIS POSITION IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE OF HIS LONGEVITY. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE RELATIONSHIPS HE HAS MADE THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THAT INCLUDES RELATIONSHIPS WITH FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO HAVE SERVED DURING HIS TIME AS CHIEF QUIRK SO DON'T THINK ANY OF YOUR SPECIAL. THE NUMBERS XCELERATED AFTER TERM LIMITS IN NINETEEN NINETY BUT ONE MAN DOTSON WILLIAMS WAS ALSO WILSON INSURED CONTINUITY WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE ASSEMBLY WORKS HE HAS ALWAYS MADE SURE WE ADHERE TO THE RULES. AND TWO TRADITIONS HE IS MORE THAN A FUNCTION WARY AND AN INSTITUTION THOUGH. HE IS ALSO SOMEONE WHO IS A NOTED TRACK ATHLETE AT UCLA EVERY TIME MY DAD COMES HERE HE AND MY DAD TRIED TO STUMP ONE ANOTHER A FEW SILLY SPORTS TRIVIA. ANOTHER OCCASION MY WIFE AND I WERE EATING WITH HER FAMILY AT A SUSHI RESTAURANT. I STEPPED AWAY FROM THE TABLE I CAME BACK AND DOTSON WAS SITTING WHERE I HAD SAT. WHERE I HAD BEEN SITTING IN HE WAS REGALING THE WHOLE FAMILY WITH STORIES. ABOUT HIS HIS TIME IN SACRAMENTO. HIS FAMILY HISTORY INCLUDES HIS MOTHER USING UNCONVENTIONAL PRACTICES TO BY THE FAMILY HOME. IN AN ERA OF REAL ESTATE DISCRIMINATION. HIS MOTHER WAS ALSO A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER IN BERKELEY OR ONE OF HER FIRST GRADE STUDENTS WITH KAMILLA HARRIS. AND BECAUSE ALL OF YOU WANTED TO KNOW THE IAN NATIONAL IN FRONT OF HIS NAME ON THE DAILY FILE STANDS FOR EDWARD. THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT DOTSON WILSON AND I KNOW YOU WILL ALL BE HERE ON THURSDAY WHEN WE'LL ALL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SPEAK ABOUT DOTSON AND HONOR HIM.

IT'S WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I ACKNOWLEDGE STOCKS AND WILSON AND HIS IMPRESSIVE LEGACY ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR THIS AFTERNOON. THROUGH HIS MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE MISTER WILSON THE SHOWN A KEEN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW DECISIONS MADE IN THIS BUILDING AFFECT AN IMPACT THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THAT UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT MAKES HIM SUCH A SKILLED PARLIAMENTARIAN AND SUCH A GENTLEMAN. WHILE I CAN'T SAY I AGREE WITH EVERY SINGLE DECISION THAT WE HAVE ON THE FLOOR. WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT HE APPLIED THE RULES FAIRLY AND HONESTLY. TO MY GREAT FORTUNE I WAS ABLE TO SPEND TIME WITH DOTSON. IN MY THREE YEAR TENURE AS MINORITY FLOOR LEADER. AND HIS ROLE AS CHIEF CLERK HE SHARED HIS COMBINE PERSONALITY HIS DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND HIS PASSION FOR CREATING CHANGE AND I AM THANKFUL FOR THE SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE HE SHARED. DURING THE TIME WE WORK TOGETHER. FROM BRING BRINGING MY STAFF A FEW TIMES TO SEE THE INNER WORKINGS OF THE CLERK'S OFFICE. TO VISITING AND GROSSING EN ROUTE AND ROLLING SO WE CAN ALL SEE WHERE THE BILLS GO AFTER WE VOTE ON THEM. HE AND HIS STAFF WERE ALWAYS HAPPY TO HAVE US. AND NOT ALL INFLUENCES ARE OBVIOUS MISTER WILSON USUALLY WORK BEHIND THE SCENES AND PREVENTED PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY STARTED AS OUR FLOOR LEADERSHIP TEAMS ALL KNOW A LOT GOES ON BEHIND THE SCENES AS WE TRY TO HAVE A SMOOTH. OPERATION HERE ON THE FLOOR. WE WILL MISS HIS VALUE AND HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE AS HE LEADS US FOR THE NEXT CHAPTER IN HIS LIFE. I CAN I CAN SPEAK FOR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WHEN I SAY HE WILL BE MISSED. FOR BOTH HIS EXPERTISE AND AS A FRIEND NO ONE IS MORE DESERVING OF RELAXING DAYS FILLED WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
