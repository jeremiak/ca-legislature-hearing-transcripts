AND PART OF WHY WE'RE HAVING

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:05.236
THIS ITEM ON TODAY'S AGENDA. A

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.237
COUPLE MONTHS AGO I READ AN

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:10.508
ARTICLE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND-

00:30:10.575 --> 00:30:11.309
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:30:11.376 --> 00:30:13.077
SUCK OUT IN THAT ARTICLE TO ME

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:14.712
BUT THERE WERE THERE WAS TO

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:16.614
MOTHERS. WHO WERE IN THAT

00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:18.149
ARTICLE AND THEY TALKED ABOUT

00:30:18.216 --> 00:30:19.517
HOW THEY SINCE HER SHOP WHEN I

00:30:19.584 --> 00:30:21.653
WAS PARALYZED IN THE OTHER WAS

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.421
LEFT WITH SERIOUS INJURIES. WHAT

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:24.622
MOTHERS ARE FORCED TO ORGANIZE

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:25.924

ORGANIZE SIMILAR CAMPAIGNS FOR

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:35.600

ALL THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH-

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:42.774

00:30:51.216 --> 00:30:52.850
ENOUGH- BUT IT'S CLEAR TO ME

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:54.652
THAT PARTICIPATING JUSTICE AND

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:55.553
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR VICTIMS OF

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.455
VIOLENT CRIMES. IF YOU TRY TO

00:30:59.657 --> 00:31:01.025

OWNERS FINDING FEES ALSO TRACK

00:50:52.949 --> 00:50:54.785

CYCLES OF IMPOSSIBLE DEBT

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.021
FRUSTRATE INABILITY TO MOVE PAST

00:50:58.088 --> 00:50:59.856
THE CONVICTION DOES VERY LITTLE

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:01.091
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IT ACTUALLY

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:04.728

00:51:21.578 --> 00:51:22.412
APPROACH THAT REALLY REQUIRES US

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.181

LOT OF WORK TO DO TO HELP

SURVIVORS HEAL AND RECOVER. FOR

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.074
THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.509
DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH WITH

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.943
SURVIVORS OF CRIME AND HEARING

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.478
DIRECTLY FROM THEM ABOUT THEIR

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:58.148
EXPERIENCES. ENGAGING THEM WITH

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.682
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:01.851
SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ACCESSING

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:03.086
RESOURCES TO HEALING AND

00:57:03.153 --> 00:57:04.587
RECOVERY WE'VE A LOT OF

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:06.589
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S

00:57:06.656 --> 00:57:08.825
HAPPENING. OUT IN THE FIELD WITH

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.059
SURVIVORS AND HOW THEY'RE

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:11.461
ENGAGING WITH THE SYSTEMS WHAT'S

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:13.496
WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING AND

00:57:13.563 --> 00:57:15.465
WHAT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:16.633
AND I'LL SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.168
TODAY. THE FIRST MOST IMPORTANT

00:57:18.234 --> 00:57:19.169
THING IS THAT WE FOCUS ON

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:21.304
HEALING AND RECOVERY. WHEN

00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:23.072
PEOPLE DON'T FEEL AND RECOVER

00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:25.408
FROM TRAUMA FROM VIOLENCE FROM

00:57:25.475 --> 00:57:27.510
CRIME THERE ARE MORE AT RISK FOR

00:57:27.577 --> 00:57:29.479
ADDITIONAL VICTIMIZATION BEING A

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.881
CRIME VICTIM IN OTHER CASES.

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:33.449
THERE ARE MORE AT RISK FOR

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:34.684
COMMITTING VIOLENT ACTS

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:37.420
THEMSELVES. AND THEY REALLY

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:39.622
DON'T RECOVER FROM THE INCIDENT

00:57:39.689 --> 00:57:41.958
AND INSTEAD THEY ARE BURIED

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.194
UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT PREVENT

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.229
THEM FROM FULLY ENGAGING AGAIN

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:49.165
IN RELATIONSHIPS. IN SOCIETY AND

00:57:49.232 --> 00:57:50.233
IN MOVING FORWARD WITH THEIR

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.869
LIVES SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:54.604
ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY

00:57:54.671 --> 00:57:55.805
- THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT WE

00:57:55.872 --> 00:57:57.473
HAVE WITH CALIFORNIA VICTIMS

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:59.442
COMPENSATION. DOESN'T MEET THE

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.711
NEEDS OF A LOT OF SURVIVORS SO

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.546
WE KNOW THAT WITH ALL OF THE

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:04.881
APPLICATIONS OF THE AND THE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.082
DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.283
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.152
WE'RE STILL OVER ONLY AVERAGING

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:10.587
A LITTLE OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:14.424
A PERSON. ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:58:14.490 --> 00:58:15.792
SEVENTY THREE. DOLLARS AVERAGE.

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:18.995
THAT ALL OF THE FUNDING REALLY

00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:20.496
DOESN'T START TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:22.098
THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS AND

00:58:22.165 --> 00:58:24.167
SURVIVORS IN THEIR RECOVERY

00:58:24.234 --> 00:58:26.135
AFTER CRIME VICTIMIZATION WE

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.671
ALSO KNOW THAT LESS THAN 1% OF

00:58:28.738 --> 00:58:29.505
THE SURVIVORS APPLY FOR

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:32.075
COMPENSATION EVER COME CLOSE TO

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:34.644
THE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MAX-

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.479
THAT NUMBER IS OFTEN USED TO

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.680
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.415
SERVICES INVICTA POP STATION

00:58:39.482 --> 00:58:41.451
EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A REALISTIC

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:44.020
NUMBER TO MEASURE. CHANGE

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:46.422
AGAINST. ANOTHER IMPORTANT

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.858
ISSUES IS RAISING THE CAPS ON

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:50.193
THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.629
WHICH CRIME SURVIVORS CAN APPLY

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:54.797
FOR WE COMPLETELY SUPPORT- IS

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:57.567
QUITE HELD IN THE- THE PROPOSED

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.035
RAISE ENOUGH CAPS PARTICULARLY

00:58:59.102 --> 00:59:00.436
FOR THINGS LIKE WE LOCATION.

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.705
WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN A

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:05.041
CRIME SURVIVOR IS NOT SAFE IN

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:06.075
THEIR OWN HOME ANYMORE AND THEY

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:07.911
NEED TO MOVE AND THE TWO

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:08.978
THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP DOESN'T GO

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:10.546
VERY FAR IN CALIFORNIA. WE

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.649
SUPPORT THAT OUR RECOMMENDATION

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:14.550
AND ALSO FOR FUNERAL BURIAL THE

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:16.953
AMOUNT OF SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.321
HUNDRED HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH THE

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.523
INCREASED INFLATION AROUND

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.325
FUNERAL AND BURIAL AND IT DOES.

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.327
LEAVE MANY SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:25.528
TO HAVE TO RAISE MONEY ON THEIR

00:59:25.595 --> 00:59:27.063
OWN TO BURY THEIR LOVED ONE

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:27.931
WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN THE

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.866
AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA AND GRIEF

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.534
AND LOSS SO WE SUPPORT THOSE

00:59:31.601 --> 00:59:34.237
THINGS. WE DO THINK THOUGH THAT

00:59:34.304 --> 00:59:37.073
THERE SHOULD BE MORE OF THE THAT

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:38.308
WE SHOULD THINK MORE BROADLY

00:59:38.374 --> 00:59:40.009
ABOUT WHO ARE SURVIVORS AND

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:41.945
VICTIMS OF CRIME. THERE ARE SO

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:43.980
MANY SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE AND

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:45.481
GUN VIOLENCE IN INTERPERSONAL

00:59:45.548 --> 00:59:48.151
RELATIONSHIPS THEY DON'T QUALIFY

00:59:48.217 --> 00:59:51.621
FOR VICTIMS COMPENSATION- WE

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.922
NEED TO ALSO BROUGHT IN AS TO

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:55.124
NEEDS HOLLAND SAID. THE IDEA OF

00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:57.694
WHO CAN RECEIVE COMPENSATION WE

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.163
HAVE MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE. MIRED

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.332
IN THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THEY

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:04.167
HAVE BOTH EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.935
AND COMMITTED VIOLENCE THEY LIVE

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.637
IN FAMILIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.306
WHERE VIOLENCE IS COMMON AND THE

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.909
REPLICATION OF THAT VIOLENCE IS

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.310
ACTUALLY HARMFUL TO THE

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:16.379
INDIVIDUAL IT'S HARMFUL TO THE

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.580
FAMILY. IT'S HARD FOR THE

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:18.681
COMMUNITY AT THE MELANIE IT'S

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.617
HARMFUL TO OUR PUBLIC SAFETY

01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:23.186
YEAH I DIDN'T OUT IN SOCIETY AND

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.755
SO TREATING VIOLENCE IS A

01:00:25.822 --> 01:00:27.757
FOUNDATIONAL MECHANISM FOR

01:00:27.824 --> 01:00:29.058
ENDING VIOLENCE AND WE NEED TO

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.893
THINK ABOUT IT IN THAT WAY. AND

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.794
THE RESOURCES NEED TO BE

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.763
DIRECTED IN THAT WAY IN ORDER

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:38.634
FOR US. TO HAVE MORE SAFETY FOR

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:39.268
PEOPLE. I'M ONE OF THE STUDY'S

01:00:39.335 --> 01:00:40.803
THAT I DIDN'T. YEAR WE ASK

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.338
SURVIVORS OUT HOW THEY FELT

01:00:42.405 --> 01:00:44.607
ABOUT IN. BROADENING THE

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.576
DEFINITION OF VICTIMS AND

01:00:46.642 --> 01:00:48.811
SURVIVORS TO INCLUDE MORE PEOPLE

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.713
WHO HAD ACCESS TO RESOURCES-

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.015
THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR

01:00:52.081 --> 01:00:53.750
THIS IDEA INCLUDING SEVENTY

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:57.387
THREE PERCENT. IN 73% ENDORSED

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.188
SUPPORTING SURVIVORS OF POLICE

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:02.058
VIOLENCE AND 53% INDOOR

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:04.427
SUPPORTING SURVIVORS WHO HAD

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:05.762
HISTORIES OF PROBATION OR

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:06.696
PAROLE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:01:06.763 --> 01:01:08.031
THAT WE ADDRESS THESE ISSUES

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:09.799
WITH PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW ARE ARE

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:12.468
ENGAGED IN AFFECTED BY AND

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.571
VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE SO THAT WE

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.840
PREVENT FUTURE VIOLENCE- ANOTHER

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:19.809
FINDING FROM THE STUDY IS THAT.

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:22.145
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF REACH YOUR

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:23.579
INFORMATION ABOUT THE VICTIMS

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.915
COMPENSATION PROGRAM. IN THE

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.116
STUDY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING

01:01:27.183 --> 01:01:28.684
CALLED SURVIVOR VOICES WHICH

01:01:28.751 --> 01:01:30.853
WILL BE RELEASED SOMETIME AT THE

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.055
END OF THIS MONTH OR THE

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.290
BEGINNING OF MARCH 60% OF THOSE

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:36.592
POLLED SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:39.562
OFFERED COMPENSATION. OF THE OF

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.763
THE PEOPLE WERE OFFERED

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.399
COMPENSATION THOUGH 89% OF THEM

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:45.201
APPLIED SO WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.070
THE PROGRAM THEY APPLY FOR THE

01:01:47.136 --> 01:01:49.939
PROGRAM. AND OF THOSE 89% THAT

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.941
APPLIED 93% RECEIVED

01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:54.544
COMPENSATION SO WE KNOW THAT THE

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:55.378
COMPENSATION IS VALUABLE IN THAT

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.679
IT HELPS PEOPLE BUT WE NEED THE

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.081
INFORMATION TO BE OUT THERE FOR

01:01:58.147 --> 01:01:59.982
THEM. AND WE NEED PEOPLE TO KNOW

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.652
HOW THEY QUALIFY FOR IT AND WHAT

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:04.787
THEY CAN USE IT FOR-

01:02:04.854 --> 01:02:06.722
UNFORTUNATELY 70% OF THOSE WHO

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.125
DID NOT GET. COMPENSATION NEVER

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.393
LEARNED WHY THEY DIDN'T GET

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.229
COMPENSATION. SO THEY'RE LEFT

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:14.664
BEING LET DOWN BY A SYSTEM THAT

01:02:14.730 --> 01:02:16.599
THEY APPLY TO FOR SUPPORT AND

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:17.733
DIDN'T GET ANY A GOOD

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.402
INFORMATION OR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:20.570
WHY THEY DIDN'T GET THAT

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:22.371
SUPPORT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.373
FURTHER EXACERBATES THE TRAUMA

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.242
AND THE GRIEF AND THE LOSS THAT

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:27.810
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING WHEN OUR

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.679
SYSTEM LET THEM DOWN. SO WE NEED

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:31.614
BETTER COMMUNICATION WITH OUR

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:36.052
SURVIVORS ALSO. I'M THE LAST

01:02:36.119 --> 01:02:37.854
THING TAT I WANT TO LAST THING

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.088
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS JUST

01:02:39.155 --> 01:02:40.590
FROM THE SURVIVOR'S PERSPECTIVE

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.391
A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS-

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:44.060
SURVIVORS THEMSELVES HAVE RAISED

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.728
SOME REALLY BIG ISSUES THAT HAVE

01:02:45.795 --> 01:02:47.630
BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY THAT I JUST

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:50.233
LIKE TO ELABORATE ON THE FIRST

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:51.434
IS THE COOPERATION RISK

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:54.370
REQUIREMENT YOU KNOW COOPERATION

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:55.872
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:57.540
QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION IS

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:58.341
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOME

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.643
SURVIVORS IT'S DETERMINED AT THE

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.178
POINT OF THE POLICE REPORT SO

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.913
RIGHT IN THE MOMENT SURROUNDING

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.948
THE TRAUMA. YEAH IF THE

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:07.350
SURVIVORS EXPERIENCING A

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.552
DRAMATIC RESPONSE IF THEY ARE

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.821
FEARFUL IF THEY ARE HURT IF THEY

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:13.322
ARE GRIEVING IF THEY ARE IN

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:15.091
SHOCK THEN THEY MAY NOT

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.893
PARTICIPATE OR COOPERATE AND

01:03:16.959 --> 01:03:18.194
THAT MAY BE PART OF THEIR

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:19.395
DRAMATIC REACTION NOT

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.030
NECESSARILY THEIR LACK OF

01:03:21.097 --> 01:03:22.665
WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH LAW

01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:23.566
ENFORCEMENT YET THOSE

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.134
DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE VERY

01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:27.003
QUICKLY IN THE PROCESS. THEY

01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.539
SHOULD BE REMOVED AS A

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:31.307
QUALIFICATION FOR ACCESSING

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:33.142
COMPENSATION FOR SURVIVORS

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.343
THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT W CAN

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.546
DO THIS- FOR EXAMPLE THEIR

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.147
INTERACTION WITH HEALTH CARE

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.982
PROVIDERS THEIR INTERACTION WITH

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.284
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WITH

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.019
OTHER GOVERNMENT SERVICES WE CAN

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:45.188
USE OTHER MECHANISMS TO

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.089
DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.258
COMPLAINING OR TRYING TO REACH

01:03:49.325 --> 01:03:53.362
RECEIVE SERVICS RATHER THAN THE

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:53.930
COOPERATION REQUIREMENT LAW

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:54.997
ENFORCEMENT. ANOTHER DIFFICULT

01:03:55.064 --> 01:03:56.532
ONE THAT SURVIVES EXPRESSES THE

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:58.568
REIMBURSEMENT ONLY MODEL THAT

01:03:58.634 --> 01:04:00.169
THE SURVIVORS HAVE TO PAY FIRST

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.871
AND THEN WAIT TO BE REIMBURSED.

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.073
AND WE APPRECIATE THE CALL B. C.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.374
B. HAS DECREASED THOSE

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.410
NOTIFICATION TIME SO THAT PEOPLE

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.312
KNOW- BETTER WHEN THEY ARE

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:10.813
EITHER FUNDED OR NOT FUNDED FOR

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.481
COMPENSATION BUT IT STILL

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:13.416
REQUIRES THEM TO PUT MONEY UP

01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:15.117
FRONT. AND ONLY HAVE SURVIVORS

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:16.052
THAT ARE LIVING PAYCHECK TO

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.753
PAYCHECK THEY CANNOT PAY UP

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.288
FRONT AND BE REIMBURSED SO THEY

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.090
OFTEN JUST DON'T APPLY FOR

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.892
SERVICES OR GET THINGS DONE LIKE

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.160
HAVING THE CLOCK CRIME SCENE

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.996
CLEANUP. OR MOVING TO BE SAFER

01:04:27.063 --> 01:04:28.965
OR SEEKING TREATMENT AND CARE

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.500
AND SO THEY ARE NOT RECOVERING

01:04:31.567 --> 01:04:33.236
BECAUSE OF THAT. CONTRIBUTION IS

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:35.571
ANOTHER BIG AREA- DECIDING IF

01:04:35.638 --> 01:04:36.672
SOMEONE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:38.674
CRIME CAN OFTEN BE SUBJECTIVE

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:39.709
AND DETERMINED BY LAW

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.677
ENFORCEMENT. AND OFTEN LEAVES

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:43.613
REALLY DESERVING VICTIMS OUT. I

01:04:43.679 --> 01:04:44.747
WAS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.849
RECENTLY LISTENING TO SURVIVORS

01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:47.817
SPEAKING LIVE LISTENING

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:50.720
SESSIONS. AND A SURVIVOR WHO-

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.188
THEIR FAMILY MEMBER HAD GOTTEN

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.189
INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO HAD

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:55.258
BEEN DRINKING. THAT DRUNK DRIVER

01:04:55.324 --> 01:04:57.159
GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT SHE WAS

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.228
PARALYZED THE SURVIVOR WAS

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.564
PARALYZED BUT LIVED- AND SHE DID

01:05:01.631 --> 01:05:03.065
NOT QUALIFY FOR COMPENSATION

01:05:03.132 --> 01:05:04.667
BECAUSE SHE GOT INTO A CAR WITH

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.369
SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING.

01:05:06.435 --> 01:05:07.303
AND SHE CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:08.304
INTO A CAR WITH SOMEONE WHO'D

01:05:08.371 --> 01:05:09.905
BEEN DRINKING THINKING THAT SHE

01:05:09.972 --> 01:05:11.274
WOULD END UP PARALYZED AND

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:12.508
EVENTUALLY DYING FROM HER

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.477
INJURIES. AND BECAUSE OF THAT

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:16.479
OUR FAMILY GOT NO SUPPORT IN

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:18.581
MEDICAL BILLS AND FUNERAL BURIAL

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:19.949
OR ANY MAIL MENTAL HEALTH

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:22.018
SUPPORT FOR THEM. TO HEAL FROM

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.553
THIS TRAGIC LOSS. SO THAT'S AN

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.656
EXAMPLE OF WHERE WE HAVE REALLY

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:29.091
SIGNIFICANT HARM CAUSED BUT WE

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:32.962
ARE OUR RESOURCES DON'T CONNECT

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:34.230
FOR THAT KIND OF A SURVIVOR.

01:05:34.297 --> 01:05:35.131
ANOTHER ISSUE I'D LIKE TO RAISE

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.466
AS A CLINICIAN IS THAT WE HAVE

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:39.702
VERY LOW FEES FOR THERAPISTS AND

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.370
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. AND

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.806
THAT IS A REAL BERIT BARRIER FOR

01:05:43.873 --> 01:05:44.840
US ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH

01:05:44.907 --> 01:05:46.642
PROVIDING PROPRIETORS AND

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.412
TREATMENT FOR SURVIVORS- THE

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.213
COMPENSATION RATE IS VERY LOW

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.548
LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS EVEN

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.317
FOR LICENSED CLINICIANS. WHICH

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.851
MEANS THAT MOST CLINICIANS WILL

01:05:55.918 --> 01:05:57.920
NOT TAKE CRIED SURVIVORS ON

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.155
THEIR CASELOAD- IN THEIR PRIVATE

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:00.990
PRACTICE MAKING IT REALLY HARD

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:03.559
FOR US TO FIND TIMELY RESOURCES.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:05.328
FOR OUR SURVIVORS INCLUDING

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.930
THINGS LIKE LANGUAGE CAPACITY OR

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.465
A SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN TRAUMA

01:06:09.532 --> 01:06:12.201
OR CRISIS- IT'S VERY HARD FOR US

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.236
TO FIND PEOPLE THAT WILL WORK AT

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:15.738
THOSE LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:17.673
YET WE HAVE HUGE YOU NEED. BOTH

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.175
IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND

01:06:19.241 --> 01:06:22.511
FOR CRYING BIG UP BECOMES. I'M

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.613
THE LAST ONE IS THAT LOST WAGES

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.415
ARE OFTEN DEPENDENT ON

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.951
COOPERATION WITH AN EMPLOYER AND

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.386
WE HAVE HAD MANY SURVIVORS

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.821
DISCUSSED THEIR CHALLENGES WITH

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.089
GETTING THEIR EMPLOYERS TO

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:34.523
COOPERATE WITH US. AND THEREFORE

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:37.259
MISSING OUT ON SUPPORT. SO WE

01:06:37.326 --> 01:06:39.495
KNOW THAT IF THISIS THE BARRIER

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:40.963
FOR MANY PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.498
APPLY FOR THE COMPENSATION AND

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.300
THEN THEY DON'T USE THAT TO HEAL

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:46.635
AND RECOVER AND TO GET BETTER

01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:47.503
FOLLOWING THE CRIME

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.538
VICTIMIZATION. I'M IN A LOT I'M

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:50.773
SORRY THE LAST ONE IS SURVIVORS

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.875
OF GUN VIOLENCE WHO ARE OFTEN

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.009
NOT ELIGIBLE BECAUSE OF

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.444
CONTRIBUTION OR COOPERATION

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.313
ISSUES. IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.547
THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE HARMED NO

01:06:58.614 --> 01:06:59.849
MATTER HOW THEY ARE HARMED

01:06:59.915 --> 01:07:02.451
HEALING RECOVER IT PROTECTS THEM

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.552
IT PROTECTS THE FAMILY IT

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:04.987
PROTECTS THE REST OF US. WHO ARE

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:07.223
AROUND HIM BECAUSE IT DECREASES

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:09.358
VIOLENCE SO HEALING TRAUMA

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.160
DECREASES VIOLENCE. AND THE LAST

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:12.528
THING I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.797
ABOUT- SOME GENDER RESPONSIVE-

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:15.664
ISSUES THAT ARE PARTICULAR

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:18.367
AROUND. VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.436
WORKING WITH PRIME SURVIVORS-

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:22.605
COMPLEX TRAUMA WHICH IS TRAUMA

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:24.540
REACTIONS THAT MANY WOMEN AND

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:26.275
GIRLS EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY THE

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.576
TRAUMA THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:29.378
EXPOSED TO OR HAVE BEE TOWARD.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:30.546
COMES FROM PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE

01:07:30.613 --> 01:07:31.881
IN RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHETHER

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:33.282
THOSE ARE FAMILY OR ROMANTIC

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.518
RELATIONSHIPS- ARE A CLOSE

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:37.019
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.554
THE KIND OF HARM THAT'S CAUSED

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.456
FROM THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE. IS

01:07:40.523 --> 01:07:42.391
REALLY CHALLENGING TO TREAT AND

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.593
IT TAKES- INTERVENTION AND

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.228
SUPPORT AND TREATMENT BUT IT'S

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:47.596
OFTEN NOT ACCESS BY PEOPLE

01:07:47.663 --> 01:07:48.998
BECAUSE THEY ARE PROTECTING THE

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:50.933
PEOPLE OF HARM THEM. AND THEY

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.435
DON'T GET BETTER SO WE NEED WE

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:53.803
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEN

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.271
MAKE THE TREATMENT AND SERVICES

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:57.306
MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. WE ALSO

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:58.574
HAVE TO CONSIDER GENERATIONAL

01:07:58.641 --> 01:08:00.376
TRAUMA- GENERATIONAL TRAUMA MAY

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.211
CAUSE PEOPLE TO NOT COOPERATE OR

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.013
TRUST OR DISCLOSED TO LAW

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.581
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF

01:08:05.648 --> 01:08:06.582
EXPERIENCES THAT THEY HAVE HAD.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.617
IN THEIR FAMILY OR IN THEIR

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:09.819
COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHY THOSE

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:13.989
CONTRIBUTION AND- COOPERATION.

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.825
EXCLUSIONS REALLY A FACT

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:19.595
PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.029
COLOR AND LOW INCOME

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.063
COMMUNITIES. ALSO ECONOMIC

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.032
ISSUES VICTIMS MAY BE MAY BE

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:25.401
DEPENDENT ON THE PERSON THAT

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:26.802
CAUSE THEM HARM THE PERSON

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:28.771
THAT'S CAUSING BY VIOLENCE. AND

01:08:28.838 --> 01:08:30.573
IN THAT WAY THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:33.175
LEAVE OR TO DO ACCESS RESOURCES

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.743
BECAUSE THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.445
INCOME THEIR HOUSING. OTHER

01:08:36.512 --> 01:08:38.047
SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN THEY MIGHT

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.049
HAVE IMMIGRATION ISSUES THAT ARE

01:08:40.115 --> 01:08:41.350
TIED TO THE PERSON THAT'S

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.052
CAUSING THEM HARM- AND THIS THIS

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.687
DOESN'T HELP THEM GET BETTER AND

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.689
RECOVER. AND HEAL FROM THE

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:48.023
TRAUMA SO WE REALLY NEED TO

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.025
THINK ABOUT THE THINGS THAT WERE

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:52.228
REQUIRING VICTIMS TO DO IN ORDER

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:53.095
TO ACCESS SERVICES. AND THE LAST

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.897
THING I JUST WANT TO END WITH

01:08:54.964 --> 01:08:55.564
THIS REALLY FOCUSING ON HEALING

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.200
AND RECOVERY. WHEN SOMEONE IS IN

01:08:58.267 --> 01:08:59.768
A DRAMATIC RESPONSE.

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:01.170
PARTICULARLY IF THEY HAVE HAD

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:02.538
MULTIPLE THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:04.373
IN THEIR LIFETIME. IT'S REALLY

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.342
HARD TO SEEK OUT AND COMPLY WITH

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.310
TREATMENT ESPECIALLY RIGHT AFTER

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.179
THE INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED. SO WE

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:11.347
NEED TO BETTER FOLLOW UP AND

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.515
COMMUNICATION AND BETTER

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:14.350
UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMELINE OF

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.118
HOW PEOPLE REACT TO TRAUMA. AND

01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:17.786
CREATE OUR SYSTEMS AROUND THAT

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.588
KNOWLEDGE NOT CREATE SYSTEMS

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:21.390
THAT PROVIDE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.592
WHO ARE RESPONDING TO TRAUMA AND

01:09:23.659 --> 01:09:25.861
VIOLENCE- AND NOT ABLE TO

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:28.631
ACCESS. SERVICES IMMEDIATELY BUT

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.165

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:22.811
STUDY THAT WAS DONE. IN

COORDINATION. WE KNOW WHAT

01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:48.557
SURVIVORS EASILY CAN FOR THE

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:51.160
CRACKS AND EASILY CANNOT END UP

01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:53.128
GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:58.467
NEED. ALSO THE MODEL. I HAS BEEN

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.536
TO BE BOTH AND COST EFFECTIVE

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.637
OTHERS AROUND YOU STREET TRY

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:03.438
THAT WAS ON IT AND SUBSEQUENTLY

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.474
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH THAT SHOWS

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:06.642
THAT THE MODEL IS BOTH

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.811
CLINICALLY AND COST EFFECTIVE.

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:10.445
FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ABLE TO

01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:12.581
DEMONSTRATE THAT THE RATE BY

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.449
WHICH SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.785
RECEIVE ENTAL HEALTH FOLLOW UP

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:19.721
INCREASED FROM 6% TO SEVENTY ONE

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.857
PERCENT. WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW IT

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:24.026
INCREASING COOPERATION WITH LAW

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:27.529
ENFORCEMENT WITH A 69% INCREASE

01:14:27.596 --> 01:14:29.364
IN POLICE REPORTS FILED. BUT

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:31.667
VERY IMPORTANTLY. WE WERE ABLE

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:34.369
TO SHOW 74% IMPROVEMENT IN

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:36.972
MENTAL HEALTH AND- SIXTEEN

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:39.741
SESSIONS PTSD SYMPTOMS WERE

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.743
DECREASED BY FORTY SIX PERCENT.

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:43.812
AND SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:47.649
DECREASED BY 47% AND IMPORT LEAD

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:49.685
TO USC WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:52.487
COST EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE

01:14:52.554 --> 01:14:57.159
THE T. R. C. MODEL COSTS. 34%

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.193
LESS THAN USUAL CAL. SO WITH THE

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.028
POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN MIND THE

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:02.297
STATE LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:04.766
INTO LAW SEVERAL INITIATIVES

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:06.602
THAT HAVE LEAD TO APPLICATION OF

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.238
CHEER SEASON CALIFORNIA. AND

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:10.539
BECAUSE OF THE BIPARTISAN

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:12.407
SUPPORT OF THIS MODEL AND

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:13.609
BECAUSE OF THE SUPPORT OF THE

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.910
CALIFORNIA VICTIM COMPENSATION

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:17.312
BOARD THEY ARE NOW EIGHTEEN TO

01:15:17.379 --> 01:15:19.014
YOUR SEIZE IN CALIFORNIA. AND

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:21.083
THIS HAS LED TO A REPLICATION

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.885
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO THERE ARE

01:15:22.951 --> 01:15:24.486
NOW THIRTY NINETEEN OF CITIES

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:27.956
LOCATED IN EIGHT STATES ACROSS

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.791
THE COUNTRY. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE

01:15:29.858 --> 01:15:30.893
STATE LEGISLATURE FOR THE

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:33.562
SUPPORT AND- HELP THE CITY FOR

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:36.098
THE SUPPORT AND BECAUSE OF THIS

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.667
THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS. AND

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.602
SURVIVORS OF VIOLENT CRIME I

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.537
NEVER RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:46.875
THE TNC MODEL OUT ABBA. FATHER

01:15:46.942 --> 01:15:49.011
IS. YOUR SEATS ARE NOT LOCATE IN

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.446
EVERY COMMUNITY SO WE KNOW THAT

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.415
THESE VARIOUS STILL EXIST FOR A

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:56.485
LOT OF OUR- SURVIVORS AND EVEN

01:15:56.551 --> 01:16:00.155
OF. VICTIMS ARE TREATED AT A TSC

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.357
STILL HAVING SOME PROBLEMS

01:16:02.424 --> 01:16:06.061
ACCESSING- REIMBURSEMENT TO THE

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.363
VICTIM COMPENSATION FUND ALL WE

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:10.032
KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THAT VICTIMS DO

01:16:10.098 --> 01:16:11.667
NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:15.237
OUT OF POCKET. EXPENSES SUCH AS

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:17.239
BURIAL EXPENSES AND-THE

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.675
LOCATION OF COURSE. AND SO THEY

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:21.376
OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT YOU KNOW AT

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.478
LEAST A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS TO

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:24.513

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:26.348
APPLICATION HAS BEEN APPROVED OR

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.550
DENIED. AND THEN IF IT'S BEEN

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:30.385
APPROVED THEY OFTEN HAVE TO WAIT

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:32.154
ANOTHER TWO MONTHS TO GET

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:34.790
REIMBURSED. FOR SERVICES AND HAS

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:36.758
BEEN HAS BEEN POINTED OUT MANY

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:39.127
OF OUR OTHER SURVIVORS SIMPLY DO

01:16:39.194 --> 01:16:44.733
NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR-

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.135
SERVICES UP FRONT- AND THERE'S

01:16:47.202 --> 01:16:50.238
ALSO BEEN. OUT OF THE- THE BANK

01:16:50.305 --> 01:16:52.507
. THAT KEEP WILL HAVE ALL A

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:55.510
POLICE. IS PROBLEMATIC MANY ARE

01:16:55.577 --> 01:16:57.279
ARE AFRAID OF RETALIATION BY

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:00.048
PERPETRATORS OF MANY OF THEM-

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:02.551
MAY MISTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT OR

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:04.553
MANY OF THEM ARE SIMPLY SO

01:17:04.619 --> 01:17:07.122
OVERWHELMED BY THE SYMPTOMS THAT

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:09.358
DRIVEN INTO ISOLATION.

01:17:09.424 --> 01:17:10.459
ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE BARRIERS

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:13.095
EXIST- I REALLY HAVE TO APPLAUD

01:17:13.161 --> 01:17:14.863
CAL B. C. B. FOR ALL OF THE

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:15.864
CHANGES THEY'VE MADE OVER THE

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.766
YEARS THAT HAVE SIMPLIFIED

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.235
THINGS AND IN FACT. THEY'VE DONE

01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:21.169
A GREAT JOB OF THE LAST SEVERAL

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.472
YEARS TRANSLATING ANY OF THEIR

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.474
BROCHURES AND APPLICATIONS INTO

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.376
A LOT OF DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:29.444
HOWEVER MY SURVIVORS ARE STILL

01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:31.646
TELLING US THAT SOME OF THE

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:34.182
CORRESPONDENCE THEY RECEIVED OF

01:17:34.249 --> 01:17:36.018
AROUND APPROVAL OR DENIAL I

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.020
USUALLY JUST IN ENGLISH AND

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.422
SPANISH AND I'M NOT TRANSLATED

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.759
INTO OTHER LANGUAGES- I HAVE

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:45.594
SEVERAL OTHER VIGNETTES BUT FOR

01:17:45.660 --> 01:17:53.035
THE SAKE OF TIME- I THINK I WILL. AND NOW AND I JUST WANT TO.

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.736
MENTION THAT THE ISSUES THAT

01:17:54.803 --> 01:17:57.272
WERE TODAY CAL. I'M NOT UNIQUE

01:17:57.339 --> 01:18:00.375
TO. THE ARE ISSUES THAT. OF

01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:02.044
VIOLENT CRIME ACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:05.914
ARE FACING- AND PARTICULARLY-

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.583
THE SYSTEM OF CARE IS BADLY

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:12.387
BROKEN IT'S IT IS NOT- THIS

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.322
BURDENSOME AND NOT PARTICULARLY

01:18:14.389 --> 01:18:17.426
TIME TIME AWAY AND- I THINK

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.361
CALIFORNIA REALLY HAS TAKEN THE

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:21.463
LEAD IN THE COUNTRY. AROUND

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:24.933
VICTIM SERVICES AND- I BELIEVE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.735
CONGRATULATE THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:28.804

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:39.948
THAT THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:44.052

NOW OF THE PANELISTS- WE ALSO

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.834

BUT WANTED TO START OFF BY

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:09.444
ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.646
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHEN CAN

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.048
WE EXPECT TO SEE A VICTIM

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:15.050
SERVICE CONSOLIDATION PLAN WHERE

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.352
IN THE THIRTY YEAR OF A PANDEMIC

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:19.020
AND SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT SOME

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:22.023
THINGS WERE DELAYED BUT WE WE'VE

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:23.892
LEARNED TO LIVE IN THIS NEW

01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.160
REALITY- AND SO WOULD DO WE HAVE

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:28.063
A PLAN TO GET IS THAT

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:30.699
CONSOLIDATION PLAN ANYTIME SOON

01:19:30.765 --> 01:19:32.300
. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:34.269

HAD MENTIONED YOU KNOW SINCE

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.809
THIS WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.444
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. BUDGET

01:19:42.511 --> 01:19:43.011
PROPOSAL MANY THINGS HAVE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:45.080
CHANGED- AND IN THINKING ABOUT

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.348
THIS ISSUE THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:48.850
TAKING STEPS TO FULLY ANALYZE

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:49.985
THAT. PULLING TOGETHER

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.586
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE THAT

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.421
SERVE VICTIMS OF CRIME TO TALK

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.589
THROUGH HOW THEY SERVE VICTIMS

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:56.391
AND WHETHER THERE IS AN OVERLAP

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:59.027
GAP OR NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION.

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.862
GIVEN THAT THE STATE WE'VE HAD

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:02.430
SO MUCH OF OUR VOTERS

01:20:02.497 --> 01:20:03.064
APPROPRIATELY DIRECTED TOWARD

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:04.399

WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.768
BEGINNING THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:08.637
AGAIN. BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:20:08.703 --> 01:20:11.673
KEEP THE COMMITTEE UPDATED AS

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.141
THEY PROGRESS. I WOULD

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:15.477
APPRECIATE THAT I WILL SAY THAT-

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.078
THE YOUR STATEMENT INCLUDED THE

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.947
NEED FOR CONSOLIDATION AND

01:20:19.014 --> 01:20:20.015
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TROUBLING

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:21.116
GIVEN THAT WE'VE COME. WE HAVE

01:20:21.183 --> 01:20:23.185
COME TO THAT AGREEMENT. I YEARS

01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:26.621
AGO- AND SO I JUST WANT TO PUSH

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:27.989
BACK ON ON THAT PART AND I DON'T

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.759
WANT THAT TO BE WITH THE LACES.

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:32.260
FURTHER AS WE DO THIS THIS WORK

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:35.497
OUT THERE. ON SO A DISBURSING

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:37.232
AND THEN. ADD A NUMBER OF OUR

01:20:37.299 --> 01:20:39.134
PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT THE MODEL

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:40.135
FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT MODEL THAT

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:41.903
WE HAVE AND HOW IT DOESN'T

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:43.705
ALWAYS WORK FOR A LOT OF OUR-

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:46.641
VICTIMS. OUT THERE US IS THERE

01:20:46.708 --> 01:20:47.842
LOWER INCOME SO WE TALK ABOUT

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:49.277
EQUITY THE MODEL BECOMES

01:20:49.344 --> 01:20:52.280
CUMBERSOME. AND LACKS EQUITY.

01:20:52.347 --> 01:20:54.182
ARE THERE ARE THERE OTHER PLACES

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.850
WHERE WE HAVE A DIFFERENT TYPE

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:57.986
OF MODEL THAT'S BEING USED- OUT

01:20:58.053 --> 01:20:59.788
THERE RIGHT NOW OR- CAN THE

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:01.323
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- CAL THE

ENFORCEMENT MODEL AND I ALSO

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:09.764

WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:17.372
WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER

01:21:17.439 --> 01:21:19.741
MODELS THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:21.476
TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS THAT COULD

01:21:21.543 --> 01:21:22.944
STRENGTHEN VICTIM SERVICES AND

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:24.546
RESULT IN DEFICIENCIES FOR STATE

01:21:24.613 --> 01:21:27.215

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:37.025
TO EVALUATE THAT. DO ANY OF THE

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.693
PANELISTS KNOW IF THERE'S ANY

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.364
MODELS OUT THERE. OR ANY ISSUES

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:44.299
WITH USING A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:51.439
MODEL THAT THAT REIMBURSEMENT.

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:55.644
WELL I CAN SAY THAT- AGAIN THE

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.445
TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER MALL WELL

01:21:57.512 --> 01:22:00.315
THERE'S A TEAM IN THE STATE I

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:01.716
WILL SAY THAT MOST OF THEM

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:03.785
REALLY ARE NOT FUND IT UP TO THE

01:22:03.852 --> 01:22:05.520
LEVEL THAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD

01:22:05.587 --> 01:22:07.522
BE FUNDED YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:10.025
SMALLER PROGRAMS ARE ONLY FUNDED

01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:11.593
AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.561
DOLLARS THAT'S CERTAINLY IS NOT

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.830
SUFFICIENT TO RUN AN ENTIRE

01:22:15.897 --> 01:22:19.801
CENTER- AND THERE ARE SOME THAT.

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:22.771
OF SO OUT OF THE EIGHTEEN TRC'S

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:25.740
I THINK OF THERE WOULD BE ANY

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:26.775
BECAUSE THE MODEL HAS BEEN

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.576
PROVEN TO BE SO EFFECTIVE TO BE

01:22:28.643 --> 01:22:31.613
ABLE TO. IMPROVE THE FUNDING FOR

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.981
THOSE EIGHTEEN TO YOUR SEASON

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:35.383
ALSO TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.584
FUNDING MORE AVAILABLE FOR

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:38.586
ADDITIONAL TIER CITIES ACROSS

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:45.260
CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU MIGHT MY

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:48.730
LAST QUESTION IS- ABOUT THE-

01:22:48.797 --> 01:22:50.598
COMMENTS THAT WAS BY A MEMBER OF

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:51.633
THE PANEL IS BROUGHT UP THE FACT

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.536

I KNOW THAT THOSE NUMBERS.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.508
POLICE THOSE COMMENTED THAT THEY

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.744
IT HAS GONE DOWN BUT IT'S STILL

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:05.680
EXIST. OUT THERE- THE FEDERAL

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.882

WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. EIGHTEEN

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:19.094
OPPORTUNITY FOR STATES TO CHANGE

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.365
THESE POLICIES I KNOW THAT- TO

01:23:23.431 --> 01:23:24.733
REMOVE THE LAMPERT'S FROM

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:26.634
ACQUIRE MANY TO STATUTORY CHANGE

01:23:26.701 --> 01:23:28.069
BUT ARE THERE ANY STEPS THAT

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:29.571
CALVI CV CAN MAKE TO

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.406
ADMINISTRATIVELY OR THE

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:32.707
REGULATIONS TO EASE THIS

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:34.909
REQUIREMENT- AND IS THIS

01:23:34.976 --> 01:23:37.579
SOMETHING THAT- CAL THE CV IS

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:42.317
DOING. AS YOU NOTED AS A

01:23:42.384 --> 01:23:44.285
STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS ARE TOP

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:46.254
ECB- CORPORATION WITH LAW

CERTAIN CRIMES. SUCH AS DOMESTIC

VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT BUT WE

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:57.766
BELIEVE ANY AND FURTHER CHANGES

01:23:57.832 --> 01:24:03.972
WOULD REQUIRE A STATUTORY CHANGE. AT WHERE IS THERE ANY- IS

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:05.106
ANYTHING THEY COULD ADMINISTER

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.242
LEAD TO EASE THE REQUIREMENT

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:11.713
ADDITIONALLY ARE. YOUR HANDS ARE

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.680
COMPLETELY TIED I GUESS IS MY

01:24:12.747 --> 01:24:15.483
QUESTION. YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO

MIND YOU KNOW OUR THEM READING

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:22.190
OF THE STATUTE IS THAT- AGAIN

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.825
OPERATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.529
KEY TO WANT IN AT THE END OF THE

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:28.830
HAVE AN APPROVED APPLICATION.

01:24:28.897 --> 01:24:30.131
WHAT ABOUT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAS

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.232
THE ONE OF THE COMMENTS MADE

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:33.201
ABOUT THAT DECISION BE MADE

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.336
REALLY EARLY ON AND THE PROCESS-

01:24:35.403 --> 01:24:37.238
BUT THEN WHEN WE HEARD ABOUT THE

01:24:37.305 --> 01:24:38.673
TRC'S WE HEARD THAT. VICTIMS

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.642
SCHOOL. ACCESSING THE TEAR

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:43.678
CEASE- SERVICES WERE MORE LIKELY

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.046
TO INCREASE THEIR THEIR

01:24:45.113 --> 01:24:48.283
COOPERATION WITH. WITH LAW AND

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:51.686
ENFORCEMENT- JUST WONDERING IF

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.222
THERE'S I UNDERSTAND THE PART OF

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.558
THE LEGISLATIVE DUTIES TO LOOK

01:24:56.624 --> 01:24:58.226
AT THAT YOU IN THAT LETTER THAT

01:24:58.293 --> 01:24:59.894
LIFE ON US AND THAT YOU AND

01:24:59.961 --> 01:25:01.429
THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR US TO

01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:03.665
WORK THERE MAYBE THIS YEAR- AND

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:06.701
SO- I APPRECIATE THAT BUT JUST

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:07.335
WONDERING IF THERE'S- MORE

01:25:07.402 --> 01:25:09.404
CREATIVE WAYS TO. TO THINK ABOUT

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.506
THIS THAT THIS WOMAN FROM FROM

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:14.709
YOUR AT THE SIDE OF THINGS. I

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.411
THANK YOU FOR THAT I HEAR WHAT

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:19.714
YOU'RE SAYING R. AND IT. YOU

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.483
KNOW IT'S THE WE WANT TO GET

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:23.117
APPROVED APPLICATIONS BECAUSE

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:24.919
THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO THEN BEGIN

01:25:24.986 --> 01:25:26.921
TO GET HAVE BILLS REIMBURSED-

01:25:26.988 --> 01:25:28.223
AND PART OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:30.358
IS MAKING SURE THAT A CRIME WAS

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:31.593
COMMITTED THAT WAS A QUALIFYING

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.061
CRIME. AND THAT THERE WEREN'T

01:25:33.127 --> 01:25:34.963
IT'S GENERATING CIRCUMSTANCES-

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:36.130
SUCH AS CORPORATIONS LAW

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:37.799
ENFORCEMENT OUR INVOLVEMENT THAT

01:25:37.866 --> 01:25:39.367
WOULD MAKE AN APPLICATION AN

01:25:39.434 --> 01:25:42.470
APPLICANT IN ELIGIBLE- SO THOSE

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.138
ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.374
WORK THROUGH AND EVERY DAY HERE

01:25:46.441 --> 01:25:48.576
COUNTY CD DO TRY TO HELP AS MANY

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:50.078
PEOPLE AS WE CAN BUT ALSO MAKE

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:51.246
SURE THAT WORK CORRECTLY.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:53.047
APPLYING THE RULES AND

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:56.217
REGULATIONS SURROUNDING THE

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.086
PROGRAM THAT CURRENTLY ITS LAST

01:25:58.152 --> 01:26:00.421
. I'D SAY THAT- I BELIEVE THE

01:26:00.488 --> 01:26:04.125
STATUTE ALSO- I WAS- THAT A

01:26:04.192 --> 01:26:06.528
MEDICAL REPORT CAN BE ACCEPTED

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.830
IN LIEU OF A POLICE REPORT. SO

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.164
IF SOMEONE IS SEXUALLY

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.267
ASSAULTED. AND THEY GO TO A

01:26:12.333 --> 01:26:14.402
HOSPITAL THE HOSPITAL IS ABLE TO

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:17.105
SUBMIT RECORDS- AND THAT THAT

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:18.773
SHOULD COUNT INSTEAD OF A POLICE

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.410
REPORT- BUT NOT. ALL THE TIME

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:24.712
MY- WITH SOME OF THE TIME THOSE

01:26:24.779 --> 01:26:27.115
RECORDS ARE REALLY NOT ACCEPTED.

01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.951
SO IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A- OF LACK

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:32.453
OF CLARITY. HOW THAT IS BEING

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.155
INTERPRETED AND I CERTAINLY

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.057
THINK THAT IS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:38.092
WIGGLE ROOM THAT WE AS- MEDICAL

01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.594
AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS.

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:42.297
SHOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SAY I

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:44.065
HAVE SEEN THIS PERSON AND I

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.934
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE A VICTIM

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.369
OF A VIOLENT CRIME. SO I THINK

01:26:48.436 --> 01:26:49.971
WHILE WE WAIT FOR THE STATURE TO

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.206
CHANGE. I THINK IF THERE COULD

01:26:52.273 --> 01:26:54.709
BE SOME MORE EDUCATION- THAT CAL

01:26:54.776 --> 01:26:57.111
THE CITY COULD OF PROVIDE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.413
MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:01.149
PROVIDERS. SO THAT THEY KNOW

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.418
THAT WE CAN SUBMIT- THAT KIND OF

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:04.819
DOCUMENTATION IN LIEU OF A

01:27:04.886 --> 01:27:08.323
POLICE. REPORT I THINK THAT

01:27:08.389 --> 01:27:11.159
WOULD BE HELPFUL. RIGHT SURVIVOR

01:27:11.225 --> 01:27:12.427
REMARKS AS ARE FOR SPECIFIC

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:14.228
CRIMES- THAT ARE LAID OUT AND

01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.597
STATUTES SO THAT DOMESTIC

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:18.132
VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULT. ARE

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:20.268
AREAS WHERE WE CAN CHANGE MENTAL

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.970
HEALTH STATEMENT OR OR MEDICAL

01:27:22.036 --> 01:27:24.973
PROVIDER STATEMENT AND BLUE. OF

A CRIME REPORT- AND STATEMENT

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:30.078
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT DOES

01:27:30.144 --> 01:27:34.248
NOT APPLY TO EVERY CRIME. OKAY

01:27:34.315 --> 01:27:36.751
THE THANK YOU FOR. FOR THAT I

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:40.321

THESE CASES LIKE YOU TO SET UP-

01:27:44.392 --> 01:27:46.527
THE COMMENT ABOUT NEEDING MAYBE

01:27:46.594 --> 01:27:49.330
ADDITIONAL EDUCATION- BOTH TO

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.632

01:29:18.352 --> 01:29:19.954
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. SHOULD

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:25.326
BE CONSIDERED. CALLINGS MISTER

IS A- YOU MENTIONED ABOUT

01:29:30.631 --> 01:29:33.134
COOPERATION OR LACK THEREOF

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:35.870
COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.472
AND WHAT CAME TO MIND.

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.140
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:29:39.207 --> 01:29:41.309
VICTIM ASSISTANCE- JUST

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:44.278
RECENTLY. AFTER AMERICAN MALE

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:46.414
WHO IS IN HIS HOME- NO KNOCK

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:50.718
WARRANT. LAFOREST WE WENT IN AND

01:29:50.785 --> 01:29:51.919
KILLED NOT ONLY WAS NOT THE

01:29:51.986 --> 01:29:54.889
PERSON THEY WERE LOOKING FOR- IT

01:29:54.956 --> 01:29:57.592
SEEMED AS IF THE CHIEF OF POLICE

01:29:57.658 --> 01:29:59.460
IN THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY. WAS

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:01.229
ALMOST LIKE THIS IS JUST A

01:30:01.295 --> 01:30:03.464
CASUALTY OF WAR. AND PEOPLE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:04.732
ESPECIALLY AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:07.068
NOT CASUALTIES OF WAR WHEN LAW

01:30:07.135 --> 01:30:09.170
ENFORCEMENT MAKES A MISTAKE. AND

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.072
ALSO APPEARED AS IF THERE WAS

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.341
GOING TO BE A COVER UP. OF THAT

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:13.975
INCIDENT WHICH IS VERY

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:15.910
DISTURBING. SAME THAT THE

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:17.812
PROCEDURES THAT WE USE WERE

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:22.984
CORRECT. AND WE HAD AN ACCIDENT. IN THAT CASE IT WERE TO HAPPEN

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.487
HERE. BOB I COULD SEE WHERE.

01:30:26.554 --> 01:30:30.491
BECAUSE OF FUTURE LITIGATION-

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.360
UNIONS GETTING INVOLVED

01:30:32.426 --> 01:30:35.329
PROTECTING OFFICERS THAT YOU MAY

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.565
NOT GET COOPERATION FROM LAW

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.734
ENFORCEMENT AND CONVERSELY THE

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.537
FAMILY MAY NOT WANT TO COOPERATE

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:43.271
WITH SOMEONE THAT MAY HAVE

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:47.141
KILLED. THEIR LOVED ONE AND SO

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.410
HOW WOULD THAT PERSON WHO NOW IS

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:52.113
LOST THEIR LOVED ONE IN A TRAGIC

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:56.584
ACCIDENT. NOW ACCESS THIS IF

01:30:56.651 --> 01:30:58.786
THEY NEED COOPERATION FROM LAW

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:01.022
ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS

01:31:01.088 --> 01:31:03.157
ANY OF THESE ON AND I WOULD ALSO

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:05.726
ADMIT AS OF FORMALLY WORKED IN A

01:31:05.793 --> 01:31:09.430
MORTUARY FOR TEN YEARS- SEVENTY

01:31:09.497 --> 01:31:11.132
FIVE HUNDRED IS WAY TOO LITTLE

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:13.668
TO PAY FOR FUNERAL ESPECIALLY OF

01:31:13.734 --> 01:31:15.903
ONE AT THE LAST MINUTE SO WHAT

01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:18.239
IF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT. FULLY

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.508
COOPERATING OR BECAUSE OF THE

01:31:20.575 --> 01:31:22.476

THAT IDENTIFICATION OF EVIDENCE

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.115
BASED PRACTICES. I WOULD ALSO

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:24.817
SAY THAT POST IS UNIQUELY

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:26.185
POSITIONED- WITH INSIGHT INTO

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:27.386
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GENCY

02:00:27.453 --> 02:00:29.388
OPERATIONS IN THE EXTENT TO

02:00:29.455 --> 02:00:31.290
WHICH A WELLNESS IS HANDLED

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:34.093
WITHIN THOSE AGENCIES- AS

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.428
DIRECTOR HOURS I THINK TOUCHED

02:00:35.494 --> 02:00:36.462
ON POST HAS IDENTIFIED THAT

02:00:36.529 --> 02:00:38.264
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP AMONG

02:00:38.331 --> 02:00:40.032
AGENCIES AT AS IT PERTAINS TO

02:00:40.099 --> 02:00:42.168
OFFERING- BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL

02:00:42.234 --> 02:00:43.903
AND ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL BONUS

02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:45.571
PROGRAMS. AND NOW SPECIFICALLY

02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:47.340
WITH THIS PROGRAM- IS TAILORED

02:00:47.406 --> 02:00:50.309
TO ADDRESS- THE IDEA REALLY IS

02:00:50.376 --> 02:00:53.112
TO CREATE ACCESS AT ONCE PROGRAM

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:55.181
THROUGH THE WORKSHOPS AND THEN

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:56.682
DISSEMINATE BEST PRACTICES THAT

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.751
DAY AND LAW ENFORCING AGENCIES

02:00:58.818 --> 02:00:59.418
CAN TAKE TO BUILD THEIR OWN

02:00:59.485 --> 02:01:01.187
LOCAL CAPACITY. AND WE REALLY

02:01:01.253 --> 02:01:02.755
THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

02:01:02.822 --> 02:01:03.756
BELIEVES THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:05.725
THE POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT- AN

02:01:05.791 --> 02:01:11.230
OVERARCHING SHIFTED. TO

02:01:11.297 --> 02:01:12.098
INCORPORATE WELLNESS. AT THAT IN

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:13.532
HERE PARTOF LAW FOR COURT. AND

02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:14.800
TRAIN WHICH WILL. GO TO

02:01:14.867 --> 02:01:17.737
IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY OVERALL-

02:01:17.803 --> 02:01:20.039
AND AGAIN TO TOUCH ON- THE L. A.

02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:20.840
WAS POINT ABOUT ADDITIONAL

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.375
JUSTIFICATION ADMINISTRATION

02:01:22.441 --> 02:01:24.443
REPORTED HAPPEN TO PROVIDE. ANY

02:01:24.510 --> 02:01:25.211
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:26.712
INVESTIGATION NECESSARY TO BOTH

02:01:26.779 --> 02:01:29.315
BE ALEJO AND LEGISLATURE I WOULD

02:01:29.382 --> 02:01:31.017
JUST NOTE THAT THE INTENT IS

02:01:31.083 --> 02:01:33.152
PROPOSED TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN

02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:35.154
DELIVERING THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE-

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:37.823
IT'S ON A CIRCUIT ONE SIZE FITS

02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:38.424
ALL APPROACH ACROSS THE STATE

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:40.593
BECAUSE- OF ON. THE DEPARTMENT

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:43.362
VARY SO MUCH AND SIZE CAPACITY-

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:46.098
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION ETCETERA-

02:01:46.165 --> 02:01:47.533
AND POST IS REALLY THE STATEWIDE

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.367
LEADER IN A LOT OF LAW

02:01:48.434 --> 02:01:49.935
ENFORCEMENT SPACE AND IT HAS THE

02:01:50.002 --> 02:01:51.837
ABILITY TO LEVERAGE. ITS

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.406
EXPERTISE TO INFORM THE PROGRAM

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.608
IMPLEMENTATION. AND THE LAST

02:01:55.675 --> 02:01:57.810
POINT M. THE L. A. RAISE CONCERN

02:01:57.877 --> 02:01:59.779
ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS

02:01:59.845 --> 02:02:02.381
ONE'S PROGRAM SB TWO. AND AGAIN

02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:04.350
INSTRUCTOR OVER AS NOTED POST

02:02:04.417 --> 02:02:05.818
HAS SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE

02:02:05.885 --> 02:02:07.486
IMPLEMENTING TRAINING PROGRAMS-

02:02:07.553 --> 02:02:09.121
PROVIDING SUPPORT TO LOCAL LAW

02:02:09.188 --> 02:02:11.824
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND I

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.926
WOULD ALSO NOTE STATE THIS WILL

02:02:13.993 --> 02:02:16.429
BE DIFFERENT STAFF COMPLETELY-

02:02:16.495 --> 02:02:18.097
YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:02:18.164 --> 02:02:21.033
WELLNESS VERSES SB TWO- SO EVEN

02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:22.535
THOUGH. SB TWO WITH OF COURSE

02:02:22.601 --> 02:02:24.136
CRITICAL OF THE CENTER FOCUS-

02:02:24.203 --> 02:02:25.104
POST DEFINITELY HAVE THE

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:31.877
CAPACITY. IN. THE ABILITY TO

02:02:31.944 --> 02:02:32.745
SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT BOTH. NOT

02:02:32.812 --> 02:02:33.379
LOCAL COULD NOT COME AVAIL FOR

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:34.980
OTHER QUESTIONS- YEAH I DO HAVE

02:02:35.047 --> 02:02:36.749
A QUESTION FOR MICHAEL. SO YOU

02:02:36.816 --> 02:02:37.983
TALK ABOUT THE GOAL OF NC AT

02:02:38.050 --> 02:02:39.318
INCREASING ACCESS AND-

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:41.487
FLEXIBILITY I THINK FOR US HERE

02:02:41.554 --> 02:02:42.822
AND FOR MYSELF IT'S ALSO

02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.657
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE EFFICACY.

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:46.492
AND THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:49.528
ACTUALLY WORKING- YOU KNOW

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:52.031
TOWARDS WHILE LESSEN WHAT

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.833
EXACTLY THAT MEANS. CURRENTLY WE

02:02:53.899 --> 02:02:55.301
HAVE CRIME PROGRAMS ALREADY THAT

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:57.436
EXIST AND TRAININGS DO YOU HAVE

02:02:57.503 --> 02:02:59.305
DATA OR MEASUREMENTS OF HOW

02:02:59.371 --> 02:03:06.679
EFFECTIVE THEY ARE. I DON'T HAVE

02:03:06.746 --> 02:03:08.214
ACCESS OKAY I BELIEVE MICHAEL

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.850
YEAH. I CAN SPEAK TO THE MANAGER

02:03:10.916 --> 02:03:12.218
GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME CENTER

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:13.252
AND ALSO I'M NOT A LOT OF

02:03:13.319 --> 02:03:15.855
QUESTIONS ON THE WEST COAST. BOB

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:17.623
WE DO SO UNDER THE INNOVATIONS

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:19.325
GRANT PROGRAM WE WERE ABLE TO AN

02:03:19.391 --> 02:03:21.560
ARTISTIC RESEARCH WITH THE UC

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:23.696
SAN DIEGO CENTER FOR MINDFULNESS

02:03:23.763 --> 02:03:24.864
THAT WE JUST RECENTLY GOT THE

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.799
REPORT BACK. YET ONE OF THE

02:03:26.866 --> 02:03:28.000
THINGS WE WERE ABLE TO GET

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:29.135
THROUGH THAT PROGRAM IS FROM

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:29.635
WHAT'S WILL READ BYTES

02:03:29.702 --> 02:03:31.637
CONTROLLED TRIAL SO BUT WHAT WE

02:03:31.704 --> 02:03:32.905
DID IS WE LOOK AT THREE

02:03:32.972 --> 02:03:33.739
DIFFERENT MINDFULNESS

02:03:33.806 --> 02:03:35.274
INTERVENTIONS TO LOOK TO SEE IF

02:03:35.341 --> 02:03:36.642
THERE WERE DIFFERENCES ACROSS

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:38.744
THOSE THREE. AND WHETHER OR NOT

02:03:38.811 --> 02:03:41.547
THEY ARE ANY OF THEM HAD ANY

02:03:41.614 --> 02:03:43.983
POSITIVE IMPACT ON. CIRCUMVENT

02:03:44.049 --> 02:03:46.986
ALL ASPECTS OF THE OFFICERS I AM

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:48.454
JUST A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF

02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:50.089
THAT REPORT. BY THE UC SAN DIEGO

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:51.023
FOUND THAT THE COMBINED

02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:52.224
INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY

02:03:52.291 --> 02:03:54.093
IMPROVED MEASURES OF AGGRESSION

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.028
MOTIONAL REGULATION. DEPRESSION

02:03:56.095 --> 02:03:58.531
ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES AND

02:03:58.597 --> 02:03:59.398
ORIGINALLY WASN'T A LOT OF

02:03:59.465 --> 02:04:00.900
DIFFERENCE DEPENDING ON WHAT

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.635
TYPE OF AN INTEREST WHICH USED

02:04:02.701 --> 02:04:04.370
THAT MUCH THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE

02:04:04.436 --> 02:04:05.404
SOME OF THE RESEARCH WE'VE TRIED

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.906
TO DO HERE WE'VE TRIED TO DO

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:08.274
AROUND WALLACE. THERE'S ALSO A

02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:09.542
LOT OF RESEARCH IT'S BEEN DONE

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:11.076
AROUND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF HONEST

02:04:11.143 --> 02:04:12.144
I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:13.412
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IF I CAN SORT

02:04:13.479 --> 02:04:15.047
OF. THINK YOU BACK OFF AT WHAT

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:16.615
MR FRANCIA SAID IN RESPONSE

02:04:16.682 --> 02:04:19.351
ALEJO IS IT THERE IS NO AGREED

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:20.519
UPON DEFINITION OF WHAT WELLNESS

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.388
SETS SILVA COULD INCORPORATE.

02:04:22.454 --> 02:04:23.489
MENTAL HEALTH THAT COULD

02:04:23.556 --> 02:04:24.723
INCORPORATE EMOTION ALL THE

02:04:24.790 --> 02:04:25.658
CUTTING CORPORATE PHYSICAL

02:04:25.724 --> 02:04:33.232
HEALTH EVEN WITHIN. EACH OF

02:04:33.299 --> 02:04:34.200
THOSE SUBCATEGORIES. THE COULD

02:04:34.266 --> 02:04:35.234
BE SPLIT UP RIGHT SO PHYSICAL

02:04:35.301 --> 02:04:36.435
COULD BE. A PROGRAM THAT AIMED

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:38.103
AT ASPEN. AT IN REGARDS. RIGHTS

02:04:38.170 --> 02:04:40.172
OF THIS IS WHAT L. A. T. DE WHAT

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:41.173
THEY WANT. A THERE WILL PROGRAM

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.308
AND LOOKED AT WHAT OR NOT THEY

02:04:42.374 --> 02:04:43.609
COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:44.944
WORKERS COMPENSATION CLIENTS.

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:46.178
WILL BE OUT BUT BETTER FOR THAT

02:04:46.245 --> 02:04:47.213
ARE COULD BE DRAMATICALLY

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.280
DIFFERENT THAN IF WE'RE LOOKING

02:04:48.347 --> 02:04:49.448
AT AN INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO

02:04:49.515 --> 02:04:51.050
SPEAK TO YOUR- MENTAL HEALTH AND

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.284
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:53.919
ISSUES LIKE EMOTIONAL REGULATION

02:04:53.986 --> 02:04:55.821
OR DECISION MAKING. OR ITS

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:58.357
IMPACT ON BIAS OR ISSUES AROUND

02:04:58.424 --> 02:05:01.594
CITIZENS COMPLAINTS A WHETHER OR

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:02.795
NOT LOWER LEVELS OF.

02:05:02.862 --> 02:05:03.329
DEMONSTRATED AND MEASURED

02:05:03.395 --> 02:05:04.964
AGGRESSION I HAVE A POSITIVE

02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:07.199
IMPACT. IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.400
YOU'RE WITH US IN THE TICKET OR

02:05:08.467 --> 02:05:10.069
WHATEVER THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.537
ASPECTS OF COME LOOK OUT SO FAR.

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:12.872
ONE OF MY CONCERNS WHEN WE TALK

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:15.608
ABOUT OUTCOME MEASURES AND IT'S

02:05:15.674 --> 02:05:17.243
IT IT'S A- WELL MADE POINT TO

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.844
THE FAIR CRITICISMS THAT WE WANT

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:20.546
TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER IT IS

02:05:20.613 --> 02:05:21.180
THAT WE'RE DOING. BUT THAT WE

02:05:21.247 --> 02:05:23.482
HAVE SOME BASIS FOR ENSURING ITS

02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:25.751
EFFECTIVENESS. IT AT THE VERY

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:27.753
LEAST DO NO HARM RIGHT WE SHOULD

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.520
MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

02:05:28.587 --> 02:05:29.622
INTERVENTIONS ARE. BUT DON'T

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.023
HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:32.258
OFFICERS DON'T HAVE A NEGATIVE

02:05:32.324 --> 02:05:33.959
IMPACT ON THE AGENCIES DON'T

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:35.828
HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:37.329
COMMUNITIES. BOB I THINK BURKE.

02:05:37.396 --> 02:05:38.797
I'M JUST CONCERNED IF WE TRY

02:05:38.864 --> 02:05:40.633
AND- TALK IN AGGREGATE TERMS AT

02:05:40.699 --> 02:05:42.501
THE STATE LEVEL ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:05:42.568 --> 02:05:43.035
WHAT WOULD BE THE OUTCOME

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:45.237
MEASRES FOR WELLNESS. THAT THAT

02:05:45.304 --> 02:05:46.572
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SORT OF

02:05:46.639 --> 02:05:48.073
PARSE OUT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.241
THE REASONS THAT REALLY OUR

02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:50.676
VISION FOR THIS. PROJECT THIS

02:05:50.743 --> 02:05:53.078
PROGRAM. IS POPPING AGENCIES TO

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:54.580
DEVELOP CAPACITY. I THINK

02:05:54.647 --> 02:05:58.784
THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME OUTPUTS.

02:05:58.851 --> 02:05:59.919
WE COULD GET FROM THERE. BUT ONE

02:05:59.985 --> 02:06:00.853
OF THE- THIS IS CHIU DEVELOPED

02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:03.055
AT EIGHT. WHILE THE WORKSHOP.

02:06:03.122 --> 02:06:04.256
WHICH ARE MODELED. TEAM BUILDING

02:06:04.323 --> 02:06:05.858
WORKSHOPS AND THAT'S A PROGRAM

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:07.493
THAT REQUIRES OUR AGENCIES TO

02:06:07.559 --> 02:06:09.295
SUBMIT. AFTER ACTION PLANS TO

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:10.763
POST WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:11.897
EVALUATE THOSE WOULD BE ABLE TO

02:06:11.964 --> 02:06:13.198
LOOK AT THE TYPES OF

02:06:13.265 --> 02:06:14.300
INTERACTIONS THAT WERE OFFERED.

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:16.168
IN WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:16.902
SPECIFIC OUTCOME MEASURES FOR

02:06:16.969 --> 02:06:18.904
THAT PARTICULAR AGENCY. THE IDEA

02:06:18.971 --> 02:06:20.673
LONG TERM FOR US IS TO DEVELOP.

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:22.074
ALMOST LIKE A KNOWLEDGE BANK

02:06:22.141 --> 02:06:24.410
WHERE. WE COULD HAVE A SET OF

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.378
INTERVENTIONS THAT WE COULD

02:06:26.445 --> 02:06:27.279
OFFER TO OTHER AGENCIES WHO MAY

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:28.948
BE STRUGGLING. WITH A SIMPLE

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.749
TYPE OF WELLNESS ISSUE. THAT

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:32.284
WOULD AT LEAST BE ABLE TO OFFER

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:33.085
OF SOME SUPPORT FOR TYPES OF

02:06:33.152 --> 02:06:35.120
THINGS THAT SEEM TO WORK WELL

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:35.754
FOR AGENCIES TO BEGIN A SIMILAR

02:06:35.821 --> 02:06:36.789
CIRCUMSTANCE. BY THE

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:38.657
GEOGRAPHICALLY OR RESOURCE WISE-

02:06:38.724 --> 02:06:40.459
MAY BE STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.694
ISSUE. I'M SORRY I COULD GO INTO

02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:43.529
THAT IN MORE DETAIL HAPPY TO IF

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.030
IT'S OF ANY BENEFIT TO ANYBODY.

02:06:45.097 --> 02:06:47.466
SO I'LL GO AHEAD AND STOP

02:06:47.533 --> 02:06:49.034
TALKING DOWN THE TOPPINGS ARE

02:06:49.101 --> 02:06:49.802
FOR THE QUESTIONS. I WHICH IS

02:06:49.868 --> 02:06:55.174
REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK. AT

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:56.842
THE L. A. O.'S- QUITE. AND TRY

02:06:56.909 --> 02:06:58.477
TO PUT SOMETHING AROUND THIS I

02:06:58.544 --> 02:06:59.178
THINK THE- IDEA THAT OUR BAR IS

02:06:59.244 --> 02:07:00.212
DO NO HARM THAN I COULD. NO

02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:02.414
MONEY IS ALSO GOING TO DO NO

02:07:02.481 --> 02:07:03.415
HARM. AS OF LATE LET'S START

02:07:03.482 --> 02:07:05.351
THERE SO THAT CAN BE OUR ONLY.

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:06.885
THAT CAN BE OUR ONLY GOAL AT THE

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:08.620
END THEY DO WE HAVE TO BE

02:07:08.687 --> 02:07:09.755
RESPONSIVE AS LEGISLATORS TO OUR

02:07:09.822 --> 02:07:12.358
TAX. TO OUR TO OUR TAXPAYERS OUT

02:07:12.424 --> 02:07:13.559
THERE TO A CONSTITUENCY THAT OUR

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.794
DOLLARS ARE BEING USED IN A WISE

02:07:15.861 --> 02:07:16.628
WAY AND THAT. WE ARE GETTING

02:07:16.695 --> 02:07:18.964
POSITIVE. RESULTS AND SO I THINK

02:07:19.031 --> 02:07:23.135
THE IDEA OF. OF HAVING SOME SORT

02:07:23.202 --> 02:07:25.838
OF MEASURING EFFICACY. NEEDS TO

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.573
BE DEVELOPED- AND WE COULD

02:07:27.639 --> 02:07:28.640
DEVELOP SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS

02:07:28.707 --> 02:07:29.808
FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY BUT THIS

02:07:29.875 --> 02:07:31.944
IDEA. THAT WILL YOU KNOW LET'S

02:07:32.011 --> 02:07:34.013
JUST LEAVE IT AS FLEXIBLE AS

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:34.780
POSSIBLE. AGAIN DOESN'T WORK

02:07:34.847 --> 02:07:36.849
WITH WITH THE DUTIES WE HAVE TO

02:07:36.915 --> 02:07:38.650
ENSURE TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING

02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:39.618
USED IN A WAY THAT THAT IS WHY

02:07:39.685 --> 02:07:43.155
SAID. RESULTING IN IN POSITIVE-

02:07:43.222 --> 02:07:45.391
IN PSITIVE OUTCOMES. ALONG THE

02:07:45.457 --> 02:07:47.960
WAY AND SO I HOPE. AS AS WE MOVE

02:07:48.027 --> 02:07:49.461
FORWARD THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO ADD

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.096
SOME ADDITIONAL DETAILS OUT

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:53.265
THERE BASED ON EXISTING WELLNESS

02:07:53.332 --> 02:07:54.299

02:07:56.535 --> 02:07:57.703
