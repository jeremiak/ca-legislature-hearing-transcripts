TODAY- I WOULD OFFER THAT. THE

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:06.986
CANNABIS INDUSTRY SHOULD BE

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:08.554
TAXED SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:10.990
INDUSTRY- BUT THE QUESTION

00:13:11.056 --> 00:13:12.258
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I WOULD

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:14.894
OFFER IS WHETHER THE TAX RATES

TAXED TOO HIGH IF YOU LOWER THE

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.018
TAXES WE DO X. Y. Z. BUT I THINK

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.586

CANNABIS BUSINESSES ARE

00:14:43.849 --> 00:14:46.318
BASICALLY BASED AT A HIDDEN TAX

RATE THAN A NON CANNABIS-

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:00.065
EQUIVALENT MIGHT BE CHARGED.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.767
CANNABIS BUSINESSES LACK ACCESS

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:03.869
TO BANK BANKING YOU CAN'T GO TO

OF THE BANKING ISSUE. AND THEN-

00:15:21.153 --> 00:15:22.888
I THINK I MAYBE ALLUDED TO A

00:15:22.955 --> 00:15:24.723
QUIRK BUT OPERATORS THEN HAVE TO

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.993

OPERATING A REGULATED MARKET.

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.131
AND THEN- SECONDLY CANNABIS

00:15:32.197 --> 00:15:33.732
ENTREPRENEURS AND CONSUMERS CAN

ENTREPRENEURS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.381
IN THE REGULATED MARKET THAT

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:52.484
MINIMIZES OPPORTUNITIES FOR

HIRING EMPLOYEES- SO. IN

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.722

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:03.621
DETERMINED BY THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.521
AND THAT TOGETHER WITH THE

00:42:04.588 --> 00:42:06.690
GOVERNOR- HOWEVER POLICYMAKERS

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.859
SEE FIT. BUT AS YOU CONSIDER

00:42:08.926 --> 00:42:10.327
POSSIBLE REFORMS TO THE TAX

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:11.862
STRUCTURE OF ADULT USE CANNABIS

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.964
IN CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ENCOURAGE

00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:15.833
YOU TO KEEP TWO IMPORTANT

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:19.169
PRINCIPLES IN MIND. FIRST TAXES

00:42:19.236 --> 00:42:21.138
SHOULD GENERALLY BE A SIMPLE AND

00:42:21.205 --> 00:42:23.574
EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE. IDEALLY

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:24.541
THE TAX STRUCTURE SHOULD BE

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.343
RELATIVELY EASY FOR US TO

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.145
ADMINISTER. AND NOT OVERLY

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.114
COMPLICATED FOR TAXPAYERS HEY

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:32.082
NOW WE ALL KNOW THE TAXES ARE

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:34.485
FREQUENTLY COMPLICATED. BUT

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:35.653
CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS TAX

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:38.188
STRUCTURE CAN BE PARTICULARLY

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:40.424
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE. AND THAT

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:41.959
COMPLEXITY IMPACTS OUR

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:44.061
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TAXES AND

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.963
AS YOU'VE HEARD FOR MANY OTHERS

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:46.764
IT ADDS TO THE BURDEN FOR

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:47.798
BUSINESSES. THAT ARE BEING

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:49.867
RESPONSIVE. IN TRYING TO ACHIEVE

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.469
HERE TO ALL OF THE STATE RULES.

00:42:52.536 --> 00:42:54.338
SECOND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:42:54.405 --> 00:42:56.173
THAT THE TAX STRUCTURE IS FAIR

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.908
TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT ARE

00:42:57.975 --> 00:42:59.977
DOING THEIR BEST TO COMPLY. WE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:02.246
HAD CD TFA OFTEN HEAR FROM LEGAL

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:04.315
CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT THEY

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:04.882
ARE BEING UNDERCUT BY THOSE

00:43:04.949 --> 00:43:07.251
OPERATING FREQUENTLY QUITE

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:09.353
FLAGRANTLY OPERATING. OUTSIDE

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.188
THE LEGAL MARKET. TO ADDRESS

00:43:11.255 --> 00:43:12.556
THIS PROBLEM AND TO BRING

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.058
FAIRNESS TO THE MARKET I THINK

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.326
IT'S IMPORTANT A CONSIDERATION

00:43:15.392 --> 00:43:17.795
OF TAX CHANGES. ALSO INCLUDE

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:20.230
ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MEASURES TO

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:21.765
PREVENT ILLEGAL CANNABIS

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:24.001
OPERATORS FROM EXPLOITING THEIR

00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:26.370
UNFAIR TAX ADVANTAGE EVEN IF THE

00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:28.973
TAXES WERE LOWER. IF SOME PEOPLE

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:31.141
ARE PAYING IT AND SOME AREN'T

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:34.478
THERE'S STILL A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:37.114
COST ADVANTAGE- TO OPERATING

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.048
OUTSIDE LEGAL MARKET THAT MUST

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.984
BE ADDRESSED. SO I THANK YOU FOR

THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX STRUCTURE

00:44:57.528 --> 00:44:59.430
PRESENTS SEVERAL CHALLENGES. THE

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:00.764
MOST OBVIOUS BEING THAT THIS THE

00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.499
SENTIMENT THAT TAXES ARE JUST

00:45:02.566 --> 00:45:04.735

OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES. SOME OF

WHICH HAVE BEEN ALLUDED TO IN

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:06.009
CONTINUE ON. I THINK THEY

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:09.679
EXPANDED RETAIL ACCESS IS IT

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.381
THERE'S A THE FUNCTIONALITY OF

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.116
RETAIL ACCESS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.517
WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:17.053
REGULATED MARKET DID YOU SELL

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.055
AND IS THERE IS NO ACCESS- BROKE

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.824
MOST OF THE INTERIOR OF NORTHERN

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:21.958
CALIFORNIA THERE'S VERY LIMITED

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.995
ACCESS. YEAH AGAIN THIS IS STILL

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.396
BEING CONSUMED THERE AREN'T.

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:27.864
SITE THAT'S NOT WOULD BE MY TAKE

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:29.566
ON OF MY CULTIVATORS PERSPECTIVE

00:54:29.633 --> 00:54:30.166
I THINK THAT THERE WERE A LOT

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:32.035
OF. A LOT OF ESTIMATES AND

00:54:32.102 --> 00:54:34.170
FORECASTS THEY WERE YOUR

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.639
PROJECTIONS THAT CAME ABOUT TO

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:37.741
DO AT THE ONSET OF SIXTY FOUR.

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:39.676
AND YOU KNOW A LOT OF THESE

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.444
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS MANY OF WHOM

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:43.880
VOTED NO THEIR POPULOUS VOTED TO

00:54:43.947 --> 00:54:45.949
APPROVE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR.

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:48.184
HAVE CHOSEN TO BATTLE ACTIVITIES

00:54:48.251 --> 00:54:51.321
AND- USE THE REGULATION AS AN

00:54:51.388 --> 00:54:54.324
ATTEMPT TO REINSTALL PROHIBITION

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:57.193
THAT'S MY TAKE. I DON'T KNOW IF

00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.462
MISTER MINER OR MISS CENTER. AND

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.664
I HOPE I'M USING CORRECT

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.465
PRONOUNS IF YOU ALL WANTED TO

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:06.302
MAYBE ADDRESS THE QUESTION. I

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:09.973
DON'T KNOW OKAY I SEE. AMBER DO

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:12.042
YOU WANT TO JUMP IN. ARE YOU CAN

00:55:12.108 --> 00:55:13.943
GO FIRST AND I'LL GO AFTER YOU

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:15.512
AND I JUST NEED TO APOLOGIZE I

00:55:15.578 --> 00:55:17.514
DON'T SEE EVERYONE ON MY SCREEN

00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.382
SO I AM JUST CALLING ON THE

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.618
PEOPLE THAT POP UP FIRST SO. IF

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:24.020
THERE'S IF YOU ALL WANT TO BE

00:55:24.087 --> 00:55:24.954
RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER AND

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:29.859
NEWSWORLD. YOU SURELY CAN BUT-

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:32.262
I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF SO I THINK

00:55:32.328 --> 00:55:34.330
REDUCING TAXES ON THE REGULATED

00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:36.900
MARKET WILL HELP- IT'S NOT GOING

00:55:36.966 --> 00:55:39.302
TO SOLVE EVERYTHING IN TERMS OF

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:40.670
THE UNREGULATED MARKET BUT IT'LL

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:43.339
- IT'LL RIGHT INCENTIVE FOR

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:45.041
THOSE CONSUMERS PURCHASING FROM

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:46.843
THE RADIO I'M REGULATED MARKET

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.578
TO PURCHASE THAT SAME OR

00:55:48.645 --> 00:55:49.379
INEQUIVALENT PRODUCT IN THE

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.980
REGULATED MARKET WE HAD AN

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:52.649
EXISTING MATTER YOU KNOW

00:55:52.716 --> 00:55:54.918
CONSUMER BASE THAT ALL OF A

00:55:54.984 --> 00:55:57.320
SUDDEN HAD TO PAY FOR MORE FOR

00:55:57.387 --> 00:55:59.122
THE SAME OR EQUIVALENT PRODUCT.

00:55:59.189 --> 00:56:00.890
AND NOT ALL OF THEM OR MANY OF

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.292
THEM HAVE BEEN TRANSITION TO THE

00:56:02.358 --> 00:56:04.861
REGULATED MARKET BEFORE ABLE TO

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:05.795
REDUCE THE TAXES THE REGULATED

00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:08.064
MARKET MAYBE THAT WILL HELP

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:08.565
ENCOURAGE SOME OF THESE

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:11.167
CONSUMERS TO COME BACK- SO

00:56:11.234 --> 00:56:12.535
THAT'S THAT'S ONE SUGGESTION

00:56:12.602 --> 00:56:14.704
OBVIOUSLY ENFORCEMENT ON ITS OWN

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:15.605
THERE'S A THERE'S A NEED FOR

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:19.175
ENFORCEMENT BUT- ON ITS OWN I

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:21.811
THINK IT'S A LITTLE. IT'S A-

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:24.414
UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT CONSUMERS

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:25.982
TO NOT TRANSITION TO THE

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:27.517
REGULATED MARKET WITHOUT A

00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:29.419
REDUCTION IN TAX RATES THE END

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:31.421
OF THE DAY THAT'S HOW WE ALL

00:56:31.488 --> 00:56:32.555
MAKE OUR DECISION A LOT OF OUR

00:56:32.622 --> 00:56:34.924
DECISIONS HOW WE SPEND OUR

00:56:34.991 --> 00:56:36.860
MONEY. REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:38.027
. BOB AND BUT YOU KNOW BUT

00:56:38.094 --> 00:56:40.730
THAT'S- IT'S AN OPINION BASED ON

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.298
YOU KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:43.633
INTERACTING WITH OPERATORS HERE

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.969
IN OAKLAND AND ALSO WITH SOME OF

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.670
THE CHALLENGES IN IN TRYING TO

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:50.106
ENFORCE OUR WAY. OUT OF A

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.741
PROBLEM. GREAT THANK YOU FOR

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.010
THAT THANK YOU AND MISS CENTER

00:56:54.077 --> 00:56:58.481
DID YOU WANNA ALSO SHARE. YES SO

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:00.617
AS SOME SMALL OPERATOR MYSELF

00:57:00.683 --> 00:57:02.585
THAT HAS TRANSITIONED OVER FROM

00:57:02.652 --> 00:57:07.857
LEGACY TO THE LEGAL MARKET- HE-

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:11.327
YOU KNOW- IT IT'S VERY

00:57:11.394 --> 00:57:13.396
DIFFICULT- GOING TO THE

00:57:13.463 --> 00:57:14.764
LICENSING PROCESS IT'S NOT

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:16.833
NECESSARILY THE EASIEST THING TO

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.235
DO SO. LOWERING THE BARRIERS OF

00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:21.137
ENTRY TO ACTUALLY BECOMING

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:25.141
LICENSED- AS IS ONE WAY TO GET.

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:28.244
MORE ILLICIT OPERATORS I

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:31.514
TRANSITIONED OVER AS WELL AS-

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.883
ECHOING GREG MINOR- LOWERING THE

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.852
TAXES CURRENTLY THEY HAVE NO

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:39.389
INCENTIVE TO PAY LOWER TAXES OR

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:41.591
PAY ANY TAXES SO LOWERING THE

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:44.494
TAXES- GETTING SOME OF THE

00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:46.229
CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE ON THE

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:48.631
LEGAL MARKET AND THEN. HOPEFULLY

00:57:48.698 --> 00:57:51.601
ARE GETTING THE- UNREGULATED

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:55.038
OPERATORS TO TRANSITION OVER- IT

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.539
IS THE TOP BEHIND THAT AND THEN

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:59.976
ALSO- ECHOING MR KEYS. ARE

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:03.546
EXPANDING RETAIL ACCESS- AS-

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.715
KAREN WATSON MENTIONED EARLIER

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.251
ONLY 20% OF CALIFORNIA'S MARKET

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.986
IS CURRENTLY ALLOWING COMMERCIAL

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:12.856
CANNABIS ACTIVITY. WHERE BIG

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:15.625
STATE- I BELIEVE 76% OF THE

00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:17.694
STATE VOTED FOR LEGALIZATION SO

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.497
THAT NEEDS TO BE REFLECTED IN

00:58:21.564 --> 00:58:22.465
THE RETAIL MARKET AND IT'S JUST

00:58:22.532 --> 00:58:24.367
NOT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MR

00:58:24.434 --> 00:58:25.835
THE DRESS YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP

00:58:25.902 --> 00:58:27.537
WITH THAT FROM BEFORE OR DID YOU

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:29.505
WANT TO ADD TO THIS. NO I WOULD

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:31.307
ADD JUST IN TERMS OF THE IF I

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:32.742
MAY IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT I

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.210
THINK THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:35.912
THAT COULD BE DONE ON THE TAX

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.280
FRONT- TO PROVIDE STRONGER

00:58:37.347 --> 00:58:40.250
ENFORCEMENT- IN BRINGING THE

00:58:40.316 --> 00:58:43.586
CANNABIS TAX- RULES MORE IN LINE

00:58:43.653 --> 00:58:44.687
FOR INSTANCE WITH THE SALES AND

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:46.122
USE TAX RULES THE STATE HAS

00:58:46.189 --> 00:58:47.123
WHICH- YOU KNOW MILLION

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.425
TAXPAYERS ALREADY- ARE SUBJECT

00:58:49.492 --> 00:58:51.928
TO. MAKE MAKE IT EASIER TO

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:54.030
ENFORCE- TAX LIABILITIES I WOULD

00:58:54.097 --> 00:58:55.331
JUST POINT OUT WHEN WE'RE

00:58:55.398 --> 00:58:57.233
EXHAUSTED HAS TO TAX RATES. BUT

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.603
THE- THAT TOBACCO TAXES IN THE

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.871
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CIGARETTE

00:59:01.938 --> 00:59:03.473
TAXES NOW TWO DOLLARS NINETY

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:04.874
SEVEN CENTS PER PACK IT'S FOR

00:59:04.941 --> 00:59:06.609
OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS IS HIGHER

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.379
THAN SIXTY PERCENT- SO WE DO

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:10.647
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THE

00:59:10.713 --> 00:59:14.884
STATE IN. AND TAXES THAT ARE

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:16.519
RELATIVELY HIGH WHERE WE DON'T

00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.988
SEE THE SAME LEVEL OF NON

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:20.290
COMPLIANCE AND I DO THINK THAT

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:22.358
THE HIGHER THE TAX ONLY. THE

00:59:22.425 --> 00:59:23.493
MORE IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.194
HAVE A TAX SYSTEM THAT MAKES

00:59:25.261 --> 00:59:26.729
SENSE AND THAT IS EASILY

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.665
ADMINISTERED AND THAT HAS-

00:59:28.731 --> 00:59:30.967
SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT AND I

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:34.404
THINK HERE- YOU KNOW- ALL OF

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:36.072
THOSE THINGS COULD BE ADDED ON

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:37.273
TO MAKE A TAX SYSTEM THAT WORKS

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.043
BETTER FOR INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.711
AFTER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:43.413
TO DIVERSIFY MY LAST LAST

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:48.351
QUESTION THE MANAGER. WITH THE

00:59:48.418 --> 00:59:50.019
MURDER OF. ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEE

00:59:50.086 --> 00:59:53.923
. BECAUSE FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:58.728
ABIDING BY THE RULES. BY THE LOS

00:59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.196
. THIS SEEMS TO BE SUCH AN

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:04.367
ENORMOUS. UNDERTAKE WHAT DO YOU

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.636
THINK COULD BE DONE TO ENSURE

01:00:06.703 --> 01:00:09.539
THE ENFORCEMENT. THE COLLECTION

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:12.241
OF THE TAXES ON THOSE WHO ARE

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:15.378
AVOIDING IT AND TO PUNISH THOSE

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.680
. PENALIZE THEM IN SOME WAYS FOR

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:21.084
THEIR AVOIDING. WELL I THAT'S A

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.485
GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.787
THEY'RE TWO AVENUES HERE ONE

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:26.923
THERE THERE IS A CRIMINAL AVENUE

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.258
CRIMINAL AVENUE OVER WHICH I

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:31.227
DON'T HAVE ANY SAY IN THAT

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.195
INVOLVES GETTING LOCAL

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.597
PROSECUTORS AND LOCAL LAW

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:37.800
ENFORCEMENT INTERESTED IN- IN

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.535
COMBATING THIS PROBLEM AND IN

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.037
VARIOUS PORTIONS THE STATE THERE

01:00:41.104 --> 01:00:42.605
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:43.439
INTEREST ON THE SEVERAL FRONT AS

01:00:43.506 --> 01:00:45.508
A TAX MATTER. I DO THINK WE'RE

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.877
ALREADY DOING A LOT WE HAVE

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:49.946
TEAMS AROUND THE STATE- WE CAN

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:53.383
SEIZE PEOPLE'S PROPERTIES- PUT-

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:57.220
SEIZE THEIR ASSETS- LEVY THEM-

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.322
TAKE WHATEVER ASSETS WE CAN FIND

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:01.324
TO SATISFY LAWFUL TAX

01:01:01.391 --> 01:01:04.927
OBLIGATIONS I DO THINK THAT THE

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.129
WAY THE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET

01:01:06.195 --> 01:01:08.731
UP- THERE ARE A FEW PROBLEMS

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.901
THAT- MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.202
US TO DO THAT THAN WE DO IN

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.138
OTHER TAX AREAS AND I WOULD

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.040
SUGGEST THAT. IF WE BRING

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.541
CANNABIS TAXES IN LINE WITH OUR

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:20.109
OTHER TAX PROGRAMS LIKE SALES

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.211
AND USE TAX THAT WE COULD DO AN

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.347
EVEN BETTER JOB AT THAT IT IS AN

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.983
ENORMOUS PROBLEM- AND IT WILL

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.651
TAKE TIME BUT THE CIVIL PATH I

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:32.355
BELIEVE- IS GOING TO BE A LOT

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:32.989
MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.891
EFFICIENT THAN TRYING TO PURSUE

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:37.660
A CRIMINAL PAST. WHEN THE

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.262
PROBLEM IS SO WIDESPREAD ROOM

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.596
LAST WON AND FOR THE MOMENT

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:43.566
MADAM CHAIR THE COMMITTEE GROSS

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.414
WAY OR ANOTHER- DIVIDE I'D BE

. BUSINESSES WE- INSP HOW MAY

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.792
PRODUCTS SEIZURES WE'VE DONE HOW

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.861
MUCH CASH HE SEES WE REGULARLY

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:13.796
HAVE TEAMS AROUND THE STATE. AT

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.431
THE RETAIL LEVEL THAT WILL GO IN

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.633
AND SEIZE ON TAX PRODUCT THAT

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.236

OUT OF THE SPACE- IN ORDER TO

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.677
SATISFY TAX OBLIGATIONS. IT'S

01:02:27.743 --> 01:02:29.512
NOT NEARLY ENOUGH IT IS THE

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:31.280
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS VERY

01:02:31.347 --> 01:02:32.882
LARGE AND THAT'S WHY I'M

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.450
SUGGESTING THAT I DO THINK THERE

01:02:34.517 --> 01:02:36.085
IS SOME SLIGHT MODIFICATIONS IN

01:02:36.152 --> 01:02:38.121
THE TAX CODE THAT WOULD. HELP US

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.255
TO DO AN EVEN BETTER JOB AT THAT

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.891
BUT- BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.192
WE REALLY NEED A STRONGER

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:44.627
PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:45.995
AROUND THE STATE BECAUSE- YOU

01:02:46.062 --> 01:02:49.499
KNOW I HAVE AUDITORS- WHO AND

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:55.838
IT'S- SENDING- AUDITORS INTO A-

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:58.774
ILLEGAL CANNABIS OPERATION. WE

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:02.712
YOU KNOW WE NEED HELP- AND WE

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:03.980
NEED LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GO IN

01:03:04.046 --> 01:03:06.315
WITH US AND THAT'S PROVEN TO BE

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:08.151
A CHALLENGE. I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:10.486
ANSWERS BUT I CAN GET YOU THE

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:11.687
DATA I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:12.889
COMMITTEE WITH. THE DATA IN

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:14.524
TERMS OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE IF

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.958
YOU WOULD BE SO KIND I WOULD

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:18.194
APPRECIATE IT. I JUST HAVE TO

01:03:18.261 --> 01:03:21.330
OBSERVE NOT WITH A SMILE BUT

01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:23.332
WITH A HUGE ROUND. WE'RE IN THE

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:25.234
PROCESS IN THE STATE OF PRETTY

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.870
MUCH DIMINISHING DESTROYING AND

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:28.871
PUTTING THE HANDCUFFS ON LAW

01:03:28.938 --> 01:03:30.139
ENFORCEMENT. WE'RE PAYING THE

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:33.176
CONSEQUENCES. BUT I SEE NO

01:03:33.242 --> 01:03:35.244
ABILITY OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.847
NOW ANY LAWN FOR. THEY ARE

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.882
LOCAL. TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYMORE

01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:41.384
AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.952
SUFFERING TODAY THAT IS JUST THE

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:45.054
SENATORIAL OBSERVATION MANAGER

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.356
THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR VICE

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.859
CHAIR AND MISTER MAJORIS AT THE

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:51.360
EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:55.498
TOBACCO EVEN THOUGH THE- TAXES

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:58.467
ARE HIGH ON THAT- THE

01:03:58.534 --> 01:03:59.902
DIFFERENCES THAT I DON'T THINK

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.137
THERE'S A MARKET PLACE FOR

01:04:01.204 --> 01:04:02.338
ILLEGAL TOBACCO THAT'S BEING

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.507
SOLD SO THE REAL ISSUE IS JUST

01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:05.341
THE COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE WITH

01:04:05.408 --> 01:04:06.475
REGARDS TO WHAT STATE IS

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:08.945
OFFERING THE SAME PRODUCT FOR-

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:10.980
WITH A LESS WITH THE- LOWER TAX.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.082
SO I DO THINK THERE'S- A

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:15.585
DIFFERENCE BUT- MISS ELLIOTT YOU

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:16.819
HAD YOUR HAND UP DID YOU WANT TO

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:19.889

01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.657
NIELSEN HAD ASKED. I DIDN'T WANT

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:23.960
TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION IF I MAY

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.495
UM TWO FIRSTS AT ECHO THE

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:28.030
SENTIMENTS OF THE DIRECTOR

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:30.233
MADURO'S THAT THERE IS AMPLE

01:04:30.299 --> 01:04:32.301
OPPORTUNITY TO STRENGTHEN. TAX

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.570
POLICY ADD TO ENCOURAGE

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:37.807
ACCOUNTABILITY- AND TO HOLD

01:04:37.873 --> 01:04:39.642
THOSE INDIVIDUALS OPERATING

01:04:39.709 --> 01:04:41.944
ILLEGALLY I COUNTABLE TO OUR TAX

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.014
POLICIES- AND- ALSO THE

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.617
DEPARTMENT IS WORKING. AT WITH

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.051
OUR SWORN OFFICERS IN

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.419
COLLABORATION WITH A NUMBER OF

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:51.854
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS

AGAINST ILLEGAL MARKET HOWEVER I

01:04:57.593 --> 01:05:00.062
THINK IT GOES. OUT IT MUST BE

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:02.431
SAID THAT HISTORICALLY WE HAVE

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.233
SEEN THAT ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.035
GET RID OF THIS MARKET. ARE

01:05:06.102 --> 01:05:07.570
THERE HAVE TO BE A NUMBER OF

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:10.539
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS- THAT WE TAKE

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.575
TO ADDRESS THE ILLEGAL MARKET.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:17.346

CANNABIS RETAIL. THAT

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.298
INCENTIVIZES. AND PERPETUATES AN

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.565
ILLEGAL MARKET BECAUSE

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:37.767

JUST TRYING TO REFRESH MY

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:36.292

THE- TAX SYSTEM FOR CANNABIS.

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.001
SOMEONE MENTIONED ALCOHOL PREP

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.037
SOMEONE COULD HIGHLIGHT FOR ME

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:49.805
THE DIFFERENCES IF THERE ARE ANY

01:06:49.872 --> 01:06:52.208
BETWEEN. CANNABIS AND ALCOHOL

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:54.410

CHAIR YES SO- STILL THERE ARE

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:10.059
SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES-

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.762
BETWEEN CANNABIS TAXATION AND

01:07:12.828 --> 01:07:15.064
ALCOHOL TAXATION IN CALIFORNIA

01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.266
AND JUST- SORT OF AT A HIGH

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.702
LEVEL THERE ARE SIX THREE

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:21.404
RELEVANT- BUT LEAST THREE

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.105
RELEVANT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:25.808
THAT ENGAGING. IN TAXATION

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.511
THERE'S FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL-

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.380
SO FOR ALCOHOL FEDERAL TAXES ARE

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:35.751
VERY SUBSTANTIAL PARTICULARLY

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:38.421
FOR DISTILLED SPIRITS- OF COURSE

01:07:38.487 --> 01:07:39.989
THERE IS NO FEDERAL EXCISE TAX

01:07:40.055 --> 01:07:42.558
ON CANNABIS BECAUSE OF FEDERAL

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:44.827
PROHIBITION WHICH COULD BE

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:46.595
THOUGHT OF AS AS AN EXTREME TAX

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:49.098
OF SORTS. ON THERE ARE STATE

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:51.133
EXCISE TAXES ON BOTH CANNABIS

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.968
AND ALCOHOL- AND THEN AT THE

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:54.637
LOCAL LEVEL THERE'S TO MY

01:07:54.703 --> 01:07:56.138
KNOWLEDGE NO SUCH THING AS A

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:58.507
LOCAL ALCOHOL TAX AT LEAST IN

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.209
CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE AS

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.777
NOTED EARLIER SOME VERY

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.879
SUBSTANTIAL LOCAL TAXES ON

01:08:03.946 --> 01:08:06.749
CANNABIS TO THE TUNE OF. AS WE

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.384
ESTIMATED IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:10.753
APPROXIMATELY THE EQUIVALENT OF

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.889
14% ON AVERAGE OF THE OF THE

01:08:13.956 --> 01:08:15.224
RETAIL PRICE. SO THEN AT THE

01:08:15.291 --> 01:08:18.828
STATE LEVEL- EARLIER I JUST TO

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:21.063
RECAP THE EARLIER DESCRIPTION

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:24.233
OF- CANNABIS TAXES STATEWIDE

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:25.835
CANNABIS TAXES THERE'S THE PER

01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.937
POUND OR PER OUNCE CULTIVATION

01:08:28.003 --> 01:08:30.172
TAXES WELL AS THE A RETAIL

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.208
EXCISE TAX WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.510
OF- IN MOST CASES THE WHOLESALE

01:08:34.577 --> 01:08:36.378
PRICE IN A FACT BUT IN SOME

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.414
CASES OF THE- RETAIL PRICE. THEN

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:41.350
ON THE ALCOHOL TAX SIDE OF THE

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.686
STATE TAXES OR ESSENTIALLY ON

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.822
THE- ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:50.893
BASED. ON DOLLARS- VOLUME OF THE

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:57.099
BEVERAGE- THE FEDERAL EXCISE

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:57.867
TAXES ON ALCOHOL ARE A BIT

01:08:57.933 --> 01:08:59.235
DIFFERENT. AND A BIT MORE

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:01.804
COMPLEX AND IN SOME CASES YOU

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.540
DEPEND ON ON THE ALCOHOL.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:07.176
CONTENT SPECIFICALLY- IN OUR

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:10.246
TWENTY NINETEEN- REPORT- THAT I

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.780
REFERENCED EARLIER WE ALSO HAD A

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.716
COUPLE ACCOMPANYING LITTLE BLOG

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:16.418
POSTS ONE OF WHICH ATTEMPTED A

01:09:16.485 --> 01:09:18.854
COMPARISON BETWEEN CANNABIS

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:20.789
TAXES IN ALCOHOL TAXES-

01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:24.226
COMBINING EXCISE TAXES AT ALL

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.195
FOR ALL THREE LAYERS OF

01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:26.762
GOVERNMENT COMBINED FEDERAL

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:28.898
STATE AND LOCAL. OF COURSE THIS

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.934
OMITS OTHER OTHER FACTORS-

01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:32.801
PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:34.436
FEDERAL PROHIBITION OF CANNABIS

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:37.039
BY COMPARING JUST THE EXCISE

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:41.310
TAXES- WHAT WE ESTIMATED WAS

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:44.179
THAT- IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:49.485
COMBINED- TAX TAXES ON- CANNABIS

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:52.555
ARE. SHOWROOM NINE DESERVE

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.290
COMBINED EXCISE TAX BURDEN IS

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:55.925
YOUNG CANNABIS IS SORT OF

01:09:55.991 --> 01:09:59.295
SIMILAR TO- DISTILLED SPIRITS-

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.164
BUT CERTAINLY CONSIDERABLY

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.433
HIGHER THAN WHINER BEER. SO IN

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.335
LOOKING AT YOUR FLOW CHART ON

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:08.404
PAGE FOUR WHICH IS PAGE FOUR OF

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:14.476
OUR HAND- YOU HAD A SLIDE- WITH

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.679
RESPECT TO CANNABIS WE HAVE THE

01:10:16.745 --> 01:10:18.981
RETAIL EXCISE TAX WHICH IN AND

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:20.649
OF ITSELF IS SORT OF CONFUSING

01:10:20.716 --> 01:10:21.584
TO ME BECAUSE AT ONE POINT IT'S

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:23.319
DESCRIBED AS AN AD VALOREM TAX

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.621
ON WHOLESALE SALES IN SOMEWHERE

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:27.656
ELSE AND START IT'S DESCRIBED AS

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.392
A FIFTEEN PERCENT. TAX ON THE

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:33.929
RETAIL PRICE. OF THE PROPOSITION

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:36.365
TALKS ABOUT A TAX ON RETAIL

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:40.035
GROSS RECEIPTS. YES THERE WAS

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:41.070
SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:43.472
DISTRIBUTORS HAVING TO COLLECT.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.808
HAVING TO ESTIMATE AND THEN PAY

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:47.743
CAN YOU SORT OF. REVIEW THAT

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:51.280
WITH ME YES PLEASE AND I BELIEVE

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:52.514
DIRECTOR INTERESTS WILL HAVE A

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:55.851
FOLLOW UP AFTER AFTER I RESPOND-

01:10:55.918 --> 01:11:01.156
SO V. MEASURE PROP SIXTY FOUR

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:04.827
ESTABLISHED A- THAT- THE 15%

01:11:04.893 --> 01:11:07.630
EXCISE TAX ON RETAIL SALES AS

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:09.832
WELL AS THE CULTIVATION TAX I

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.900
AND THAT SORT OF AS FAR AS IT

01:11:11.967 --> 01:11:13.869
WENT IT WAS THESE TAXES AS

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.904
ESTABLISHED IN PROP SIXTY FOUR

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:18.340
WERE NOT. RADICALLY DIFFERENT

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:22.277
AND INFORM FROM- FOR EXAMPLE YOU

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:23.712
KNOW SOME OTHER TAXES THAT THE

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:25.080
STATE ADMINISTERS ALTHOUGH AS

01:11:25.147 --> 01:11:27.483
SOME PANELISTS OF NOTI HAVING A

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:30.085
CULTIVATION TAX PER SE ON AN

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:38.260
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT IS NOVEL AT. THE STATE LEVEL I'M- BUT NINE

01:11:38.327 --> 01:11:41.630
FOUR OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN- IS

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:44.433
WHAT INSTITUTED THIS- COLLECTION

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.901
AND REMITTANCE AT THE

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:48.370
DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL AND SO THAT'S

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.972
SORT OF WHAT WHAT ALTERNATELY

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:53.042
GAVE US THE SYSTEM- WHERE

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:54.410
DISTRIBUTED THE FINAL

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:55.678
DISTRIBUTOR OF THE CANNABIS

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:58.013
PRODUCT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.282
REMITTING THE TAX TO THE STATE-

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.384
BUT TO SORT OF WORK THAT INTO A

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.987
SYSTEM THAT HAD. A CULTIVATION

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:07.022
TAX IN A RETAIL EXCISE TAX IT

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:09.725
NECESSITATED SOME WORKAROUNDS

01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:11.827
AND ONE OF THEM WAS TO FIGURE

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:14.730
OUT A WAY TO COLLECT THE TAX-

01:12:14.797 --> 01:12:16.732
THE RETAIL EXCISE TAX BEFORE THE

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.667
RETAIL SALE EVER BERZINS THAT'S

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:19.868
SORT OF REFLECTED ON THE FLOW

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.370
CHART IN THE HANDOUT AND I

01:12:21.437 --> 01:12:23.639
SUPPOSE. DIRECTOR MENTOR US I

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.307
DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO GO TO

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.709
HAMMER WELL I JUST AS WHY WAS

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:28.410
WHY NOT HAVE THERE IF IT'S IF

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:30.045
IT'S A TAX BASED ON RETAIL

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:32.915
SALES. WHY NOT HAVE THE TAX

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.850
COLLECTED AT THE POINT OF SALE.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:38.887
AND. THEN REMANDED EITHER

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.690
DIRECTLY. TO CD T. OR IF THERE'S

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.292
- BUSINESS REASON TO HAVE IT

01:12:43.358 --> 01:12:45.360
ROUTED THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTOR

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:45.894
HAVEN'T ROUTED THROUGH THE

01:12:45.961 --> 01:12:47.863
DISTRIBUTOR. SO NOBODY'S

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.065
FLOATING ANY MONEY. WE KNOW

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.501
EXACTLY WHAT THE TAX IS SUPPOSED

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:55.637
TO BE. AND ISN'T THAT A SIMPLER

01:12:55.704 --> 01:13:03.479
PROCESS. YES OKAY. WELL I GUESS

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:06.148
WE'LL HAVE TO REVISIT THE- SO

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.083
THERE IS NO PARTICULAR LEGAL

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.752
REASON WHY IT WAS STRUCTURED THE

01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:11.520
WAY IT WAS STRUCTURED IT'S JUST

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.522
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THE

01:13:13.589 --> 01:13:16.091
SAUSAGE HERE. WELL I AM SURE I

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:17.359
THINK THERE WAS AT LEAST ONE

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.093
OTHER PANELIST WITH THE

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.697
DIFFERENT- PERSPECTIVE BUT-

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.866
CERTAINLY WE WERE IN OUR TWENTY

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:24.700
NINETEEN REPORT WE DISCUSSED

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.902
SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS OF AND

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.371
STRUCTURING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:32.941
BUT ULTIMATELY- BONTA D. AS SORT

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:34.276
OF SIMPLER PERCHES LIKE WHAT

01:13:34.343 --> 01:13:36.078
YOU'RE DISCUSSING ULTIMATELY.

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:38.113
MEETS AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:39.381
THAT THE DISTRIBUTORS BE TAKEN

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:40.616
OUT OF THE PROCESS I'M JUST

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:41.784
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER

01:13:41.850 --> 01:13:43.619
WAY TO CALCULATE THE TAXES

01:13:43.685 --> 01:13:45.587
ULTIMATELY REMITTED. THERE MUST

01:13:45.654 --> 01:13:47.389
BE SOME GOING BACK AND FORTH IF

01:13:47.456 --> 01:13:49.291
SOMEBODY'S ESTIMATING AND THEN

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:51.059
THERE'S AN ACTUAL RETAIL SALE AT

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.394
SOME POINT YOU MUST HAVE TO TRUE

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:54.963
UP THE PROCESS. IF YOU'RE DOING

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:58.100
IT RIGHT. WELL I THINK ANYWAY

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.334
SAID MINIMUM PROBABLY SHOULD GET

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.503
OTHER PANELISTS BUT JUST. THE

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.505
WAY THEY LAW THE STATUTE IS

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.573
CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IT'S NOT A

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.142
REQUIREMENT TO BE TRUE IT UP

01:14:07.209 --> 01:14:08.644
BECAUSE IT'S ESSENTIALLY ONLY

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.346
TRYING TO APPROXIMATE THE 15% IN

01:14:11.413 --> 01:14:13.348
AND IN AGGREGATE. NOT WITH

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.650
RESPECT TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:17.119
TRANSACTION OKAY AND THEN ONE

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.821
FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION I GUESS.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:21.156
ON THE CULTIVATION TAX IF I'M

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:23.025
LOOKING AT YOUR FLOW CHART. DOES

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.427
THE DOES THE TAX TO THE PROCEEDS

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:27.462
ACTUALLY FLOW TO THE FIRST

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.630
DISTRIBUTOR AND THEN TO THE

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.499
MANUFACTURER AND DOWN TO THE

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.467
LAST DISTRIBUTOR AND FINALLY TO.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:37.806
CD TFA. OR IS THAT JUST OF- FOR

01:14:37.873 --> 01:14:39.007
PURPOSES BILLS. AND IF THE

01:14:39.074 --> 01:14:41.443
ANSWER IS YES. THEN WHY ISN'T

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:43.445
THE TAX PAYMENT FLOWING DIRECTLY

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:45.013
TO THE FIRST DISTRIBUTOR FOR

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.416
USING THE DISTRIBUTOR MODEL. OR

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:51.520
TWO CD TFA SO- AGAIN BE

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.590
INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE-

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:55.691
OTHER OTHER PANELISTS BUT ALL

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.392
ALL JUST SORT OF LAID OFF WITH

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.861
THAT BECAUSE I'M EXPLAINING ARE

01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.129
FLOW CHARTS SO MY AGE IT'S NOT

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:03.432
INTENDED TO BE A METAPHOR- YOU

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:05.234
WE REALLY ARE UNDERSTANDING IS

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.969
THAT THERE IS THERE IS AT LEAST

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.837
IN PRINCIPLE ARE PAYMENTS

01:15:08.904 --> 01:15:10.772
FLOWING IN THAT FASHION OF

01:15:10.839 --> 01:15:12.541
COURSE AND THERE'S A LOT OF US

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:13.709
WRITING DIVERSITY IN WHAT

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:16.445
CANNABIS AT TAX SUPER SORRY WHAT

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:18.247
CANNABIS SUPPLY CHAINS LOOK LIKE

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:20.682
SO THAT'S- AYE IN THAT SENSE IT

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.417
IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE ALTHOUGH WE

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:25.053
TRY TO CHOOSE A VERY. COMMON

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.388
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS A VERY

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.590
COMMON STRUCTURE- OUR

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.058
UNDERSTANDING IS THE STATUTE

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:32.261
REQUIRES THE FINAL DISTRIBUTION

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.062
TO BE THAT THE POINT OF TAX

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:36.265
REMAINS EVEN FOR THE CANNABIS

01:15:36.331 --> 01:15:37.766
CULTIVATION TAX BUT I'M SURE

01:15:37.833 --> 01:15:39.268
OTHER FOLKS COULD AT AND THAT'S

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.936
WHY WE ILLUSTRATED THAT WAY BUT

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.437
OTHER FOLKS GOOD AT WHAT JUMP

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:44.239
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE IN THE

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.474
SECOND FOR. ALL BUT IT'S THE

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.376
STATURE NOT THE PROPOSITION THAT

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:48.944
REQUIRES THAT SO WE'VE YES

01:15:49.011 --> 01:15:49.778
THAT'S MY UNDERSTAND THAT MY

01:15:49.845 --> 01:15:51.546
UNDERSTANDING IS THIS THIS THIS

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.983
WHOLE ALL OF THAT- ARISES FROM

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.485
SB NINETY FOUR AS I UNDERSTAND

01:15:56.551 --> 01:16:01.723
AND I'LL THROW OUT ONE FINAL.

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.324
QUESTION AND I'M- PERFECTLY.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:03.392
WILLING TO. MOVE AND LEAVE YOU

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.761
WILL I BY YOU ENOUGH BUT- DO WE-

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:07.996
EXPERIENCE ANY TAX WRECKAGE AS

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:10.332
OPPOSED AS A RESULT OF THIS FLOW

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:12.200
CHART WHERE THE MONEY FLOWS

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:14.269
AROUND BEFORE IT ACTUALLY GETS

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:17.005
TO THE- CD TFA. I THINK THAT'S

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:19.975
ONE WHERE I WILL INDEED HAVE TO

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.411
DEFER TO THE OTHER- PANELIST WE

01:16:22.477 --> 01:16:24.212
DON'T HAVE ANY HARD DATA ON THAT

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:27.249
WE- IT SEEMS IN PRINCIPLE LIKE A

01:16:27.316 --> 01:16:29.851
SNIFF AGAIN- COMPLIANCE PROBLEM

01:16:29.918 --> 01:16:31.553
BUT OR I. I SHOULD SAY A

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.356
SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE CHALLENGE

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:35.991
THAT YOU KNOW THE EXTENT TO

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:37.426
WHICH IT CAUSES AN ULTIMATE

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.961
PROBLEM IS NOT SOMETHING WE HAVE

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.396
HARD DATA ON A NON. SO DEFERRED

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.331
ANY OTHER PANELISTS ON THAT ONE

01:16:42.397 --> 01:16:44.266
WELL IF THIS WERE THE PLUMBING

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:44.833
IN MY HOUSE I HAVE A LEAK

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.002
SOMEWHERE. AS USUAL YOU'VE BEEN

TFA WANTS TO WELL ACTUALLY WE

01:16:51.406 --> 01:16:53.141
HAVE PEOPLE WHO'VE. HAD THEIR

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.576
HAND UP TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:55.711
THE QUESTION THANK YOU KNOW IF

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.379
YOU'RE ON FINISHED YEAH NO NO SO

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.448
MISS CENTER AND THEN MISS WHAT'S

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:04.119
AND. AND THEN WILL END WITH

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:05.053
DIRECTOR MADURO'S. I YES THANK

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:08.290
YOU I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY-

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.958
THERE'S A SENSUALLY A HIT IN

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.728
FEDERAL TAX- WHICH IS THE TWO

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:15.630
EIGHTY E. R. AND IRS TAX CODE

01:17:15.697 --> 01:17:19.968
WHICH- PROHIBITS- US AS A

CONFUSING BUT I THINK IT'S

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:52.267
IMPORTANT THAT WE RUN DOWN THESE

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.970

TAXES CERTAIN AT THE TIME. THAT

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:32.501
THE PRODUCT FLOWS FROM THE

DISTRIBUTOR TO THE RETAILER. BUT

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:38.573

IN CAREER. THIS WOULD SEND.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.646
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN THAT'S MY

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.915
UNDERSTANDING WE IN THE IN IN

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.917
THE IN THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY MY

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.318
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.953
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE BURDEN IS

01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:53.855
WHEN IT'S PRODUCED IN OUR

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:57.058
<u>ITUATION THE BIRD AND AS AS</u>

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.794
THANKS BYE WE OFTEN DON'T WE

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.930
DON'T GET WE DON'T COLLECT FROM

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:03.865
THE RETAILER WE'RE WE'RE HAVING

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:06.968
TO PAY. CITIES THE FAA BEFORE

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.170
WE'VE ACTUALLY COLLECTS ABOUT

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:09.404
REVENUE FROM THE RETAILERS

01:20:09.471 --> 01:20:12.941
BEFORE THAT PRODUCT HAS LEFT THE

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:15.110
SHELLS AND THE REASON I MEAN I

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.344
THINK WHERE WHERE WHAT WE'RE

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:17.746
STRUGGLING WITH HERE IS THAT

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.614
TAXES IN CALLAHAN COUNTY IN

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:22.918
CALIFORNIA CANNABIS ARE DO YOU.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:25.854
LEGALLY WHEN THE PRODUCT ENTERS

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:26.955
. WHAT WE CALL THE LEGAL

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:28.990
SUPPLIES CHANNEL AND THAT IS THE

01:20:29.057 --> 01:20:31.459
POINT AT WHICH- THE FINAL

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:37.699
DISTRIBUTOR CAN DOCKS. QAQC SO.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.935
ALL OF THAT THE PAYMENT IS DUE

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.970
AND SORT OF THAT THAT THE STATE

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.605
DEEMS THAT PRODUCT HAVING BEEN

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.674
SOLD. OUT THE POINT OF

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.676
DISTRIBUTION BEFORE IT ACTUALLY

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.644
GETS SOLD FROM THE STOP. WELL IT

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.747
SOUNDS LIKE I MEAN IT SOUNDS

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:54.516
LIKE WHEN THE RETAILER. REQUIRES

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.584
THE PRODUCT FROM THE DISTRIBUTOR

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.818
AT THE WHOLESALE PRICE THE

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:58.954
WHOLESALE PRICE ALSO INCLUDES.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.956
AN EXCESS TASTE BETTER ACCESS TO

01:21:01.022 --> 01:21:02.524
TAX COMPONENT THAT'S BASED ON

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:04.192
VOLUME APPARENTLY THAT IS THEN

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:05.961
REMITTED TO THE STATE. THE

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.329
RETAILER TAKES THE PRODUCT AND

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:09.764
THEN SELLS IT OFF THE SHELF AND

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.866
WHATEVER ELSE IS DUE IT'S DO

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.568
WHICH IS NOT. THE CASE WITH

01:21:13.635 --> 01:21:15.604
CANNABIS WHERE WE'RE MAKING AN

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:17.272
ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE RETAIL

01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:19.274
SALES PRICE WOULD BE. THE

01:21:19.341 --> 01:21:21.576
WHOLESALER THE DISTRIBUTOR PAYS

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:24.479
THE ESTIMATE AND THEN I GUESS

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:26.615
THE RETAILERS IN THE PROCESS AND

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:27.916
YOU DEPEND ON COLLECTING THAT

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:29.351
MONEY FROM THE RETAILER AT SOME

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:31.019
POINT ONCE THE PRODUCT MOVES OFF

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.854
THE RETAILER'S SHELF IS IN MY IT

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:33.955
IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAY

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.523
THIS PROCESS WORKS CORRECT

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.192
YOU'RE ON YOUR ON THE RIGHT PATH

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.194
AND THAT THAT COMPLAINT I THINK

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.630
THE DIFFICULT PART. IS THAT IS

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:44.032
THAT OFTEN TIMES THE PRODUCT

01:21:44.099 --> 01:21:45.066
THAT LEAVING THAT'S LEAVING THE

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:49.037
SHOP DOESN'T SELL AT THAT 80%

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:55.243
MARK OUT. WOW OKAY WELL YES- SO

SOMEONE'S CENTER ROCKS CONCERNS

01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.232
THE TEAMSTERS IT'S REALLY NO

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.000
SECRET THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:22:19.067 --> 01:22:20.669
DEFINITELY THE FOLKS IN THE ROOM

THAT ARE ASKING THAT THE TAXES-

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:25.407
ST AT THE DISTRIBUTOR THERE'S A

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.375
NUMBER OF REASONS. WHY WE FEEL

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:30.178
THAT WAY- REALLY WHEN WE STARTED

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:33.782
DOWN THIS PATH. WE ARE TAKING A

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:35.550
- UNDERGROUND ILLICIT INDUSTRY

01:22:35.617 --> 01:22:37.519
AND PULLING IT UP INTO. A

01:22:37.585 --> 01:22:39.487
TRANSPARENT MARKETPLACE AND THE

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:42.157
DISTRIBUTORS ROLE- AND THE

BALANCE- I AGREE WITH KAREN

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.735
WHOLEHEARTEDLY THAT I THINK THAT

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:55.937
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TEETH TO

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:58.907
PROTECT YOUR DISTRIBUTORS- AND

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.008
THEN IF THEY HAVE THOSE

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.376
PROTECTIONS IN PLACE THEN THERE

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:06.081
ARE. YOU KNOW THERE. WOULDN'T

LEANING TOWARDS A SPACE WHERE

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:15.290
YOU KNOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO-

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.093
REWARD THE GOOD ACTORS AND- I

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.694
TAKE OUT THE FOLKS WHO. WE'RE

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:23.064
NOT REMITTING THE TAX SO. IF WE

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.432
HAVE DISTRIBUTORS WHO ARE HAVING

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.568
ISSUES ACTUALLY COLLECTING AND

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.570
RECEIVING THE TAX. BUT MY NEXT

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.871
QUESTION IS HOW ARE WE THEN

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.773
GOING TO TRUST THOSE SAME

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.175
VENDORS THE SAME RETAILERS.

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:40.315
REMITTING THE TAX THE STATE. TO

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:41.916
DO THIS AT THE DISTRIBUTOR LEVEL

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:44.152
THEN WHY WOULDN'T. HE EXPECTS

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:46.421
THE EXCISE TAX BE BASED ON. THE

01:23:46.488 --> 01:23:48.223
WAIT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE CANNABIS

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:49.758
IF THAT'S THE PROPER WAY TO DO

01:23:49.824 --> 01:23:51.493
IT IF WE'RE DOING ALCOHOL BY BY

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:54.062
VOLUME. AND THEN HAVE THE

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.698
RETAILER PAY THAT- TO THE

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:58.166
DISTRIBUTOR HAVE THAT TAX

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:01.002
REMITTED TO. CD TFA AND THE

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:02.837
RETAILER TAKE THE PRODUCT AND

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.106
MOVE IT OFF THE RETAILER'S SHELF

01:24:05.173 --> 01:24:07.442
WERE NOT. WOULD THAT BE A MORE

01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:11.246
CERTAIN WAY TO DO THIS AND THEN

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:12.480
. I'M SORRY AND THEN THE

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:13.648
RETAILERS ABLE TO SELL THE

01:24:13.715 --> 01:24:15.183
PRODUCT WHATEVER THE RETAILERS

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:16.418
ABLE TO SELL THE PRODUCT IF

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:18.319
IT'S- THE IN OTHER WORDS TO TRY

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:19.854
TO MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT. A

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:22.257
CLOSER TO THE ALCOHOL MODEL IF

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:24.092
WE'RE GOING TO USE THE ALCOHOL

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:26.361
MODEL OF. DISTRIBUTION AS THE AS

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:29.030
THE WAY TO GO FOR CANNABIS. I

01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:30.131
THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY REFERRING

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:31.533
TO POTENCY BASE MAY BECAUSE WE

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.468
DO HAVE TO WAIT BASS ALTHOUGH I

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.303
WILL NOT CLAIM AT ALL TO BE A

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:38.506
TAX EXPERT I WILL LEAVE THAT TO-

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:41.743
DIRECTOR MADURO'S- BUT- I JUST

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:44.345
WANTED TO. ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:47.048
CONCERNS AND ALSO- ECHO WHAT

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:48.750
WHAT KAREN WAS SAYING FROM CUBA

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:52.487
THAT- BEFORE WE DISMANTLE. OF

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:53.855
THE DISTRIBUTION PIECE WE THINK

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.956
THAT THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.491
THAT COULD BE ADDED BEFORE WE DO

01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:58.059
THAT AND ONE OF THAT WOULD BE

01:24:58.126 --> 01:24:58.726
ONE OF THOSE WOULD BE

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:00.128
PROTECTIONS FOR YOUR

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:02.163
DISTRIBUTORS. AND THEN WHY NOT

01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:04.999
HAVE THE CULTIVATION TAX PAID.

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.201
PERHAPS THROUGH THE FIRST

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:07.569
DISTRIBUTOR THAT'S FINE BUT THEN

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:11.272
DIRECTLY TO CD TFA. IF IT'S A

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:12.540
CULTIVATION TAX I DON'T KNOW

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:17.011
WHAT. IT'D VALUE. WHAT VALUE

01:25:17.078 --> 01:25:18.346
WOULD BE ADDED TO THE PRODUCT

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:20.348
MOVING THROUGH MANUFACTURING AND

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:21.649
THE OTHER DISTRIBUTORS IF IT'S A

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.451
CULTIVATION TAX AS OPPOSED TO

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:26.554
SOMETHING ELSE. THOSE ARE GOOD

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.323
QUESTIONS I WISH I HAD A GREAT

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.525
ANSWER FOR YOU. WELL I DON'T

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:31.693

DO YOU. HAVE I YOUR HAND HAS

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.570
BEEN UP FOR A MINUTE AND IT

01:25:42.637 --> 01:25:44.205
SOUNDS LIKE. YOU KNOW THE RENT

01:25:44.272 --> 01:25:46.674
IS TOO HIGH AND THE CANNABIS

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:48.977
TAXES ARE TOO HIGH. I DON'T SET

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:52.514
THE RATES BUT- I WOULD JUST SAY

01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:54.716
THAT SENATE ROTH HAS-

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:59.621
IDENTIFIED. VERY QUICKLY AND-

01:25:59.687 --> 01:26:00.822
SOME OF THE KEY PROBLEMS THAT

01:26:00.889 --> 01:26:03.291
EXIST IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:05.593
CURRENT TAX SCHEME AND IF I

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:07.829
COULD JUST TAKE A MINUTE ON THE

01:26:07.896 --> 01:26:10.665
ON THE CULTIVATION TAX PIECE IF

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:12.534
THE CULTIVATION TAX WORD REMAIN.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:13.635
HAVING IT PAID BY THE FIRST

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.236
DISTRIBUTOR FOR THE FOR THE OF

01:26:15.303 --> 01:26:16.971
THE FIRST PURCHASER ABSOLUTELY

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:19.140
MAKES SENSE THAT THE ADDED

01:26:19.207 --> 01:26:21.009
COMPLEXITY OF TRYING TO FIGURE

01:26:21.075 --> 01:26:23.778
OUT- YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:27.248
JUST- CANNABIS FLOWER THAT IS

01:26:27.315 --> 01:26:29.651
BOUGHT AND THEN DIVVIED UP AND

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:33.087
SOLD IT IS- YOU KNOW. MADE INTO

01:26:33.154 --> 01:26:35.156
EXTRACT WHICH IS THEN PASSED

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.792
ALONG TO SOMEBODY ELSE WHO MAKES

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.528
IT INTO IT. CANDY OR CHOCOLATE-

01:26:40.595 --> 01:26:42.830
OR INTO SOME SORT OF VAPE POD

01:26:42.897 --> 01:26:45.400
IN. AND TO TRY TO TRACK THAT IS

01:26:45.466 --> 01:26:47.702
JUST IS VERY DIFFICULT. I'M AND

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.370
I DO THINK IT MAKES IT MUCH

01:26:49.437 --> 01:26:50.338
EASIER FOR THERE TO BE TAX

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.740
LEAKAGE- ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY

01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:54.576
THAT YOU KNOW BY AND LARGE WE

01:26:54.642 --> 01:26:56.411
SEE THE- MOST PEOPLE IN THE

01:26:56.477 --> 01:26:57.645
LEGAL MARKET ARE TRYING THEIR

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:59.380
BEST TO COMPLY BUT IT IS VERY

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:01.149
COMPLICATED FOR THEM AND FOR US

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:05.286
TO ADMINISTER. AND THEN- AT AT

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.555
THE SALES POINT. THE YOU KNOW

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:10.458
THE PROP 6415% RATE WAS

01:27:10.525 --> 01:27:11.259
SOMETHING THAT I THINK PEOPLE

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.827
CAN UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE LIKE

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:16.064
A 15% EXTRA SALES TAX. I THINK

01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:17.732
THE CURRENT SYSTEM WITH THE

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:21.302
AVERAGE STATEWIDE MARKUP- IS

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:22.303
CONFUSING FOR INDUSTRY

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:24.706
PARTICIPANTS FOR CUSTOMERS AND

01:27:24.772 --> 01:27:27.842
IT MAKES IT- MORE DIFFICULT TO-

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:29.677
ADMINISTER WHICH IS NOT TO SAY

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:31.646
THAT THERE'S NOT A VERY

01:27:31.713 --> 01:27:34.048
REASONABLE- ROLE FOR.

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:35.116
DISTRIBUTORS TO PLAY IN THE

01:27:35.183 --> 01:27:36.951
SYSTEM- CERTAINLY THERE'S

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:39.120
TESTING THERE YOU KNOW COULD BE

01:27:39.187 --> 01:27:40.221
SOME OF THESE TAX FUNCTIONS AS

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:43.324
WELL BUT- I THINK IF. BEFORE WE

01:27:43.391 --> 01:27:45.526
THROW UP OUR HANDS AND SAY THAT

01:27:45.593 --> 01:27:47.795
YOU HAVE. THE TAX SYSTEM. CAN'T

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:52.066
WORK I WOULD JUST HOPE THAT- WE

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:53.901
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT AND TAKING

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:55.103
SOME VERY COMMONSENSE

01:27:55.169 --> 01:27:57.672
SIMPLIFICATION MEASURES ON THE

01:27:57.739 --> 01:27:59.607
SENATE ROTH. AND MANY OTHERS

CONCERNED ABOUT PART OF THIS IS

01:28:30.772 --> 01:28:32.306
THAT PROPOSITION WHICH REQUIRES

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.875
US TO GO BACK OUT TO THE VOTERS

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:35.410

AND HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.283
OTHER TAXES SO THAT WE CAN TRY

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:43.951

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:04.679
HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE WAY THAT

NOT FIXED IN STATUTE BUT- WE'RE

01:33:35.176 --> 01:33:37.478

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:25.252
THAT DOES UNFORTUNATELY IS

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.854
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.188
PURCHASE FROM ILLEGAL. FROM

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:29.656
LEGAL ENTITIES FROM COMING TO

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.325
LEGAL ENTITIES BECAUSE THE TAXES

01:40:31.392 --> 01:40:32.593
EVEN GOING TO BE HIGHER. THAN

01:40:32.659 --> 01:40:34.261
WHAT THEY'RE PAYING NOW. WE JUST

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:36.463
NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.598
DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF REVENUE

01:40:37.664 --> 01:40:39.266
NEUTRALITY- RELATIVE TO THE

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:41.235
ISSUE OF- ALLOCATION THREE TO

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:43.637
USE SERVICES- THERE HAVE BEEN

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.506
SOME FOLKS WHO ARE. ARGUING

01:40:45.572 --> 01:40:47.541
AGAINST ANY KIND OF TAX REFORM.

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:48.709
BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL THAT

01:40:48.776 --> 01:40:50.277
THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE MONEY ON

01:40:50.344 --> 01:40:51.912
THAT'S GOING TO THESE PROGRAMS.

01:40:51.979 --> 01:40:53.614
I MEAN WE APPRECIATE RESPECT

01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:55.783
THAT OBVIOUSLY WE WERE ALL PART

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:56.417
OF PROP SIXTY FOUR BUT PUTTING

01:40:56.483 --> 01:40:58.118
IT TOGETHER. AND THEN THAT WAS

01:40:58.185 --> 01:41:00.687
IN PROP SIXTY FOUR SO WE'RE ALL

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:01.555
COMMITTED. TO THOSE FUNDS GOING

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.757
TO YOU SERVICES. THE PROBLEM IS

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:04.591
OVER THE LAST TWO QUARTERS WE'VE

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:07.361
SEEN A STEADY REDUCTION. IN TAX

01:41:07.428 --> 01:41:09.430
REVENUE- TO THE STATE. AS THAT

01:41:09.496 --> 01:41:10.998
REDUCES IT MEANS THAT WE'RE

01:41:11.064 --> 01:41:11.799
GOING TO HAVE LESS MONEY

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:13.667
AVAILABLE ANYHOW YEAR. FOR

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:16.303
ALLOCATION FREE. SO THEY HAVE TO

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:18.305
BE CAREFUL IN STANDING IN THE

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:20.607
WAY OF TAX REFORM. BECAUSE IF WE

01:41:20.674 --> 01:41:22.509
DON'T GET TAX REFORM ALL WE'RE

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:23.877
GOING TO SEE A REDUCTION RATHER

01:41:23.944 --> 01:41:25.813
THAN AN INCREASE IN TAXES. ON

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:27.047
BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A

01:41:27.114 --> 01:41:30.851
MORE ROBUST LEGAL- MARKET PLACE-

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:31.885
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:32.986
BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OF

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:35.088
TRANSITION. FROM PROVISIONAL TO

01:41:35.155 --> 01:41:37.257
ANIMALS- APPRECIATE ON DIRECTOR

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:39.092
ELLIOTT'S COMMENTS AND HOPE THAT

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:41.128
THEY ARE ON TRACK TO DO THAT I

01:41:41.195 --> 01:41:42.396
HAVE TO TELL YOU. THE INDUSTRY

01:41:42.463 --> 01:41:44.932
IS PROFOUNDLY ANXIOUS. ABOUT

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:45.432
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO

01:41:45.499 --> 01:41:47.367
TRANSITION IN TIME. FOR THOSE

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.969
WHO ARE OPERATING LEGALLY BUT

01:41:49.036 --> 01:41:50.871
ARE STILL PROVISIONAL. OF BEING

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.539
ALLOWED TO TRANSITION TO ANNUAL

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.308
IN TIME THAT THEY'RE NOT PUT OUT

01:41:54.374 --> 01:41:56.343
OF BUSINESS. CAN YOU LOSS OF TAX

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.545
REVENUE LOSS OF JOBS. AND OTHER

01:41:58.612 --> 01:41:59.980
THINGS. AND THEN FINALLY IN

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:02.015
ANSWER TO SENATOR NELSON'S

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:02.850
QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT HOW WE

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:05.586
DEAL WITH- THE ILLEGAL MARKET. I

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:07.020
WANT TO POINT OUT ONE ISSUE THAT

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:08.489
HAS COME UP RECENTLY- THERE WAS

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:11.325
A- FABULOUS VICE DOT COM-

01:42:11.391 --> 01:42:13.794

SAMBAR DINO COUNTY. IN WHICH

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.667
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:23.403
OPERATING THOSE ILLEGAL GROWS.

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.571
I'M SAYING THAT THE REASON THEY

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:27.241
DID SO. IS BECAUSE IT WAS A COST

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:28.809
OF DO IT AT ANY THE PENALTIES

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:30.811
ORG TEAM WORKS. DOING BUSINESS.

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:33.280

MARKET TO A LEGAL MARKET- AND

02:04:41.106 --> 02:04:44.343
THEIR REASONS THAT- THAT THAT

GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS.

02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:11.270
DECIDING THAT THEY WEREN'T GOING

02:05:11.337 --> 02:05:12.238
TO ALLOW CANNABIS IN THEIR

02:05:12.304 --> 02:05:14.874
COMMUNITY- THEY'VE DRAGGED THEIR

02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.710
