FOR FOR FOR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THIS IS ELECTIONS AND REDISTRICTING COMMITTEE OF MAY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SINCE THE PROPOSED CONSENT CALENDAR WAS RELEASED ONE ITEM HAS BEEN PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR THAT ITEM IS MINE. AB SEVENTEEN OH SEVEN WHICH ARE PRESENT LATER IN THIS HEARING. THAT LEAVES US WITH SIX ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM NUMBER THREE ITEM NUMBER FOUR AND NUMBER SIX AND NUMBER SEVEN AND NUMBER NINE AND NUMBER -- TEN WE WERE NOT GOING TO GET TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR YET -- BEFORE WE DO THAT LET'S ESTABLISH A QUORUM MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL [inaudible] BERMAN [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] GALLAGHER [inaudible] CALDERON [inaudible] LOW [inaudible] MAYES MULLIN. WEBER HERE WE HAVE A QUORUM NOW WE HAVE A QUORUM DOES ANY MEMBER WAS TO REMOVE AN ITEM FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND ON TEN I'M NUMBER TEN A. B. EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINE BY THE ELECTIONS IN ADDITION COMMITTEE. AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THOSE AMENDMENTS ADDRESSED THE OPPOSITION THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS WITH THAT DOES ANY NUMBER WHICH TO PULL ANYTHING FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR. SEEING NONE DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. BERMAN. HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON LOW. MAYES MULLIN MULLIN AYE WEBER WEBER I THE BILL IS OUT ON THE FOR A VOTE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NEXT UP WE HAVE MISTER OBERNOLTE WITHOUT A NUMBER. TWO AB. SIX TEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. TO MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AB SIX TENS A VERY SIMPLE BILL CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT WHEN A BALLOT IS PLACED ON I'M SORRY WHEN A BOND MEASURES PLACED ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER APPROVAL. THAT ESTIMATE FOR THE TAX RATE REQUIRED TO SERVICE THE BOND ALSO BE PLACED IN THE LANGUAGE FOR THE BALLOT STATEMENT. CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT. X. RAY TO BE EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS PER. HUNDRED SO DOLLARS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF ASSESSED VALUE HOWEVER. ACCORDING TO ZILLOW THE AVERAGE VALUE OF A HOUSE IN CALIFORNIA IS OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH REQUIRES A FAIR BIT OF MATH ON THE PART OF THE VOTER TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEIR TAX RATE WOULD BE ON THEIR PROPERTY. SO THIS BILL AB SIX TEN SIMPLY REQUIRES THAT TAX RATE TO BE EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO MULTIPLY BY THREE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT WHICH WOULD BE ME OF THIRTY THOUSAND SO ARE THERE IS A JUST ONE LOT OF OPPOSITION THAT WE'VE GOT NOT THAT THAT'S FROM THE COALITION FOR AFFORDABLE -- I'M SORRY THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING IN THAT OPPOSITION LETTER THEY EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT -- IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR VOTERS TO HAVE TO USE A CALCULATOR TO FIGURE OUT THAT TAX RATE. I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE WITH THAT SENTIMENT I THINK IT'S OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST VOTERS WILL NOT PULL OUT THE CALCULATOR THEY'VE GOT OTHER THINGS TO DO WITH THEIR TIME THEY'VE GOT OF THINGS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER. TO HAVE THEM BE ABLE TO LOOK AT AT THE TAX RATE THAT'S EXPRESSED AND HAVING THEM AND HAVE THEM INSTANTLY BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE. ALSO KIND OF WRITTEN BEHIND BETWEEN THE LINES OF THE COALITION'S LETTER A IS SOMETHING THEY DON'T COME OUT AND SAY IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE. BY THE BELIEF THAT EXPRESSING THE RATE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD MAKE VOTERS LESS LIKELY TO APPROVE BONDS YEAH AND I ALSO VERY STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH DOES NOT SUPPORTED AT ALL IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH. THE MORE THAT VOTERS DON'T UNDERSTAND OR CONFUSED ABOUT A BALLOT MEASURE THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO SIMPLY VOTE NOW AND SO I THINK THAT THE BETTER JOB THAT WE CAN DO IT INFORMING THEM EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THE PROS AND THE CONS WHAT THEY GET AND WHAT. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THE MORE LIKELY THEY ACTUALLY WILL BE TO APPROVE. A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT SO THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE -- CIVIL MEASURE THAT SO GOOD FOR VOTER TRANSPARENCY I'D REQUEST TRUCKLOAD. THANK YOU MISTER MULTI -- ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. UNDER THE BILL. I HAVE A MOTION. I HAVE A SECOND. THE MORNING REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION PRODUCT AT SCHOOL HOUSING -- WE DO OPPOSE A. B. SIX TEN WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE TRANSPARENCY AND THE INTENTION OF COMMUNICATING VERY CLEARLY WITH VOTERS REGARDING THE IMPACT IMMEASURABLE HAVE ON THEM -- THE TAX RATE STATEMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A GREAT TOOL TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. UP WE BELIEVE THAT EIGHTY SIX TEN ACTUALLY PROVIDE PROVIDE VOTERS WITH LASSEN SPECIFICITY REGARDING THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION AND THE SPECIFIC ASSESSED VALUATION OF THE PROPERTY. THAT THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN VOTERS ARE MORE LIKELY UNDER THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE A GUESSTIMATE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THEIR HOME IS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AND SEE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY ACTS FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE A DIFFERENT NUMBER I'M SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE -- WITH THE CURRENT LAW AND THE TAX RATE STATEMENT. OF CENTS PER ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ASSESSED VALUATION IT'S A VERY SIMPLE MATH CALCULATION AND YOU CAN GET PRECISELY THE IMPACT ON THE INDIVIDUAL VOTER AND THEIR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE. SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE DO OPPOSE EIGHTY SIX TEN IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF UP WE BELIEVE THE CHANGES UNNECESSARY WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD ACTUALLY INCREASE VOTER CONFUSION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR MON. FAMOUS SHARON THANK YOU MISS ROBIN ULTI AND I KNOW YOUR GOALS GOOD ONE HERE TO BRING CLARITY. FOR VOTERS I'M TRYING. TO GET BY MY HEAD AROUND THIS YEAR SO IT WOULD THERE BE EXAMPLE WHERE. IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY UNLIKELY WITH EXAMPLES OF PROPERTY. EVALUATION UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. SURE SO. IS ON THE BALLOT MEASURE. AND WHAT IT APPLIES TO THERE ARE VERY MANY HOMES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE WORTH UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CERTAINLY VACANT PROPERTIES -- A LOT OF THEM ARE WORTH HUNDRED UNDER A HUNDRED THOUSAND MANY BONDS DON'T APPLY TO THE VACANT PROPERTIES BUT SOME DO -- WHAT ELSE POSSESSORY INTERESTS THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT SOMETIMES THAT CERTAINLY ON PROPERTY TAX RULES SOMETIMES BONDS CAPTURE THOSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T BOB ON SECURE PROPERTY LIKE BOATS? BOB CERTAINLY MANY OF THOSE WORTH UNDER THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AGAIN SOME BONDS CAPTURE THOSE SOME DON'T -- BUT THE OTHER VAST MAJORITY WOULD BE OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND THANK YOU FOR THAT'S HOUSE YOU KNOW THINKING ALONG THE LINES OF OF HOMES BUT YEAH THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF PROPERTIES THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED HERE CELL. I THINK A HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS IS PRETTY PRETTY LOW AND THAT DOES REQUIRE A CALCULATOR TO COME OUT. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED SOMETHING LIKE A THOUSAND DOLLARS WHERE -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINK IN TERMS OF PROPERTY VALUE IN. THE END THOUSANDS INCREMENTS OF A THOUSAND YOU KNOW MY CONDO NOW MY CONDO A CONDO -- WORTH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU KNOW YOU DO THAT MATH TWO HUNDRED TIMES THAT NUMBER YOU SEE. ON THE BALLOT IS THAT A SIMPLER CALCULATION OF CLARITY IS THE GOAL. I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IF YOU MAKE IT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR STANDARD AND YOU'VE GOT PROPERTY LESS THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT CAN BE MISLEADING I WOULD THINK UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. SO IF CLARITY IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL HERE'S OUR A SIMPLER WAY TO DO THIS THAT. IS MORE INCLUSIVE OF ALL PROPERTY -- BUT BUT BRINGS ADDITIONAL CLARITY IN. AND OUT. NOT IN MY CASE I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT MATH BUT FOR SOME FOLKS THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREMENTS CALCULATION AND THEY'RE HEADING IN A VERY -- QUICK SNAPSHOT OF WHAT THEY'D BE PAY YOU KNOW IT IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK THAT PER HUNDRED THOUSAND IS SIMPLER IF YOU HAVE A HOME IT'S WORTH MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND ODD. HOWEVER PER THOUSAND WOULD BE A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN FIGURE OUT WITH THE MATH THAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO. USING EXAMPLE FROM THE OPPOSITION'S WATER BECAUSE I'M FAIR MINDED THAT WAY. THE THE OPPOSITION'S LETTER THE EXAMPLES A HOUSE WORTH THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND EXPRESS TACK RATE IS A NICKEL PER HUNDRED DOLLARS SO JUST THINK FOR A MINUTE. WHAT YOU WOULD DO EVEN IF YOU HAVE A CALCULATOR SITTING IN FRONT OF YOU TO DO THAT CONVERSION? BUT MOST CALIFORNIANS I CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO BUT IT'D BE MUCH SUPPORT WITH PER THOUSAND JUST MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF THOUSANDS. IN YOUR VALUES SO THAT WOULD BE MULTIPLIED BY THREE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO FIGURE OUT SO -- THAT BUT I THINK A HUNDRED PER HUNDRED THOUSAND IS BETTER PER THOUSAND IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER. OVER WHAT WE'VE GOT NOW AND AND FRANKLY JUST I'M WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THE STAGES OF GRIEF HERE I'VE GOTTEN A BARGAINING SO. HI IF IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE OKAY WITH EXPRESSING THE REAPER THOUSAND I'D BE WILLING TO AMEND THE BILL THAT WAY. SO I FEAR THAT I'VE MADE OF SURPRISE THE CHAIR HERE WITH THAT SUGGESTION AND SOMETHING THAT I JUST THE THOUGHT OF QUITE LITERALLY ON THE ELEVATOR UP HERE. BUT THE BILL BEFORE US IS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND I'D HAVE TROUBLE SUPPORTING THE BILL BEFORE US. BUT MORE THAN HAPPY -- TO TO TALK WITH -- THE CHAIR IN AND YOU ON A SIDE BAR SEE THERE SOME OTHER WAY TO GET OUT WHAT YOU'RE HOPING TO GET OUT HERE MISTER OBERNOLTE BOBBY ON A LITTLE EARLIER THAN I PLANNED ON BEING ON MY IS MY CONCERN I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND WAS A THOUGHT THAT I'D HAD IT WHEN -- YEAH I READ MISTER WANT OR MISTER OBERNOLTE IS BILL IT'S FUNNY WHEN I WAS DOING THE CALCULATIONS I ACTUALLY FIND FOUND MYSELF AND AND THINKING THE OTHER TWO GOALS AND AND I APPRECIATE. THE THE AUTHORS GOALS -- OF OF CLARITY BUT I THINK WE ALSO NEED ACCURACY -- AND WE CAN'T SACRIFICE ACCURACY. IN IT FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY -- AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO VOTERS TO PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATON THAT ALLOWS THEM TO GET TO AN ACCURATECALCULATION OF WHAT THEY DO. IN A BOND MEASURE WHICH IS WHY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS DOES NOT DO THAT -- AND I DO NOT SUPPORT THAT WHEN I WAS DOING MY CALCULATION ACTUALLY. FOR NOT I DON'T EXPECT THIS BUT HOW MUCH OF GOING THE OTHER WAY. WHICH IS EVERYONE MAKE IT EASY FOR VOTERS THEN DO IT PER DOLLAR. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR HOUSE IS WORTH YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR CONDO IS WORKING ON THAT YOUR PROPERTY IS WORTH. AND YOU TO IF YOU HAVE THAT THE PER DOLLAR CALCULATION ON THE BALLOT THEN YOU JUST MULTIPLY IT BY HOW MUCH YOUR PROPERTY IS WORTH AND YOU GET TO A SIMPLE CALCULATIONS ARE ACTUALLY CUTS OUT THE STEPS. THERE'S NO. YOU TAKE THE TOTAL TOTAL VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTY YOU DIVIDE IT BY SOME INCREMENT IN THE U. MULTIPLIED BY NUMBER. YOU JUST MULTIPLY IT BY A NUMBER -- AND SO I GUESS I'M ON OPEN TO THE CONVERSATION ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS I STILL THINK IT'S IT'S DIE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT REALLY MAKES THINGS THAT MUCH. EASIER FOR VOTERS -- I THINK GOING TO A DOLLAR FRANKLY MAKES IT IF THE GOAL IS EASE AN ACCURACY. THAN GOING TO A DOLLAR PROVIDES EASE AND ACCURACY IT CUTS OUT THE STEPS THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH YOU OWE IN A BOND MEASURE AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE OUR GOAL -- AS GOVERNMENT SO -- THAT YOU KNOW I I I APPRECIATE -- YOU KNOW THE THE THE EFFORTS AT AT YOU KNOW FINDING -- A COMPROMISE I JUST I I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THAT REALLY HELPS -- AND AND SO I YOU KNOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD SUPPORT THAT -- I THINK I THINK THE AUTHORS GOT TIME -- YOU KNOW I I DON'T I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S NECESSARY TO HAVE THIS -- GOING TO AFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SO I THINK OF THE AUTHOR WANTED. TO TO YOU KNOW. TURN THIS INTO A TWO YEAR BILL AND AND GIVE MORE TIME FOR CONVERSATIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ON THE SPOT RIGHT NOW ON THE IN A PLACE TO SUPPORT A THOUSAND DOLLARS VERSUS A HUNDRED DOLLARS I DON'T KNOW. THAT IT MAKES THINGS SO MUCH EASIER AND I THINK IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS. I DON'T THINK IT MAKES IT ANY BETTER THAN THE CURRENT SITUATION [inaudible] PLEASE -- I'VE I MEAN I JUST THINK IT DOES MAKE IT A LOT SIMPLER AND THE MOST THINGS ARE IN THE HUNDRED THOUSANDS MOST OF THE YOU KNOW. PROPERTY TAXES THAT WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH DEAL WITH YOUR HOME AND OUR HOMES ARE ARE WORTH A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN. HUNDRED DOLLAR INCREMENTS NOW -- SO IT IS TO ME IT IS IT DOES MAKE IT SIMPLER AND A FOR IF THE IDEA TO MAKE IT SIMPLER. SO THE VOTERS CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO COST THEM. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A REGIONAL MEASURE WE CAN WORK THROUGH WHAT THAT SHOULD BE. I MEAN THIS STILL GOT TO GO THROUGH A LOT OF PROCESS AFTER pWOULD ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE ON IT -- OBVIOUSLY AUTHOR CAN DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO TERMS OF MAKING IT TO BILL TO YOUR BILL OR NOT BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF PROCESS TO GO HERE AND WE CAN PROBABLY FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S HE REMINDS ME OF THE BIBLICAL. YOU KNOW. WHAT WAS IT SALAS KILLED AS THOUSANDS AND DAVID IS KILLED AS TENS OF THOUSANDS YOU KNOW? WHICH ONE WE GET INTO YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING 200-010-0001. HUNDRED THOUSAND WELL YEAH. ONE OF THOSE YOU KNOW -- BUT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER RICHER'S GET IT DOESN'T GO TO SYNAGOGUE IN A WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS -- IT YEAH I THINK IT WOULD HELP SIMPLIFY THEM FOR YOUR SON THAT NOT DAMAGES EXAMINER. ON I WAS GOING TERM A MICROPHONE OFF. WITH WHATEVER THAT IS QUESTION A TAKEN US DOWN THE ROAD SORRY -- WHATEVER THE NUMBERS I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT YOU KNOW SIMPLER FOR VOTERS AND LET'S FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. MISS GHANA I APOLOGIZE FOR FOR BEING A LITTLE LATE TRAVELING WITH THE KIDS IN THE MORNING IS ABSOLUTELY NO JOKE -- BUT JUST IF YOU COULD AT IN YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY ADDRESSES BUT YOU GET DRESSED A KIND OF WHAT I SHARED WITH YOU IN MY TAXED -- THIS MORNING I IN OF THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WE DO WE NEED TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT SOMETIMES IT'S OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE WERE IN A SIGNIFICANT. ECONOMIC RECESSION I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WE MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES BY HAVING A RAINY DAY FUND UP IN THE EVENT THAT WE NEED TO PUT A BOND ON THE BALLOT FOR A REALLY SIGNIFICANT REASON. AND VOTERS ARE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS DIFFERENTLY IN THERE LOOKING AT A BIGGER NUMBER THIS TIME THEY COULD DISCOURAGE VOTERS FROM BEING ABLE -- TO GET THEMSELVES TO POSITION WHERE THEY CAN SUPPORT THAT MEASURE -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT IT IS AN ALREADY DIFFICULT ENOUGH TO GET DIFFERENT BOND MEASURES THAT WE PLACE ON THE BALLOT WHETHER TO TAX INCREASE FOR SPECIFIC REASON BECAUSE WE NEED FUND EDUCATION OR WHATEVER ELSE -- BUT I I I I WOULD WANT TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAVE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO STUFF THAT THE LEGISLATURE PUTS ON THE BALLOT. FOR A VERY VERY LEGITIMATE REASON AND THEN ALSO IF YOU COULD JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY DONE IT -- ON THE YOUR AND YOUR NEED ARE YOU YOU'RE PERCEIVED -- NEED FOR THIS BILL SURE. SO IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I VERY MUCH DISAGREE WITH THE ASSERTION THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO GET BOUGHT MEASURES APPROVED. IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESEARCH. IT VERY MUCH DOES NOT SUPPORT THAT CONCLUSION BECAUSE THERE BEEN MANY MANY STUDIES DONE ON VOTER BEHAVIOR -- YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN INFLUENCING VOTER BEHAVIOR. AND THE STUDIES SHOW OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT THAT THE MORE CONFUSION THAT VOTERS HAVE ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO VOTE NO. AND SO I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IF IT'S CLEAR TO A VOTER. NOT ONLY THE COST BUT ALSO THE BENEFIT. THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY TO GET TO A YES AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO PROMOTE THAT TRANSPARENCY I ACTUALLY THINK THAT I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT YES GAS POLITICAL CONSULTANTS WILL TELL YOU. IF YOU WANNA KILL AN INITIATIVE JUST MAKE SURE IT'S AS CONFUSING AS POSSIBLE AND YOU GO OUT THERE YOU SOW CONFUSION AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO GET VOTERS TO VOTE NO. TO TRY TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S SO COMPLICATED THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE MOST LIKELY I CHECKED THAT NO BOX. AND SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IN SOME CASES THAT'S WHERE WE ARE WITH. WITH IN OVER EXPRESSING THESE RATES PER HUNDRED DOLLARS I MEAN WE THE EXAMPLE WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT A MINUTE AGO IF YOU GOT A THREE AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. AND THE AND THE TAXES EXPRESSED AS A NICKEL PER HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU KNOW WHAT. WHAT WOULD YOU DO WHAT DO INTERNAL CALCULATOR DO THAT CONVERSION I MEAN MOST OF US HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT A BUNCH? AND IN ON ANOTHER THING I THINK IT'S WORTH SAYING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S GERMANE TO OUR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS PER THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. HE IS -- COMES FROM THE STUDY OF OF HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE. WHICH IS AT A FIELD THAT THE DECISION OFF MY COMPANY IS -- IN A DOES WORK IN. WHAT WE CALL THAT PROCESS ON BOARDING PROCESS BETWEEN WHEN A USER STARTS IN AND WHEN A USER COMPLETES DOING WHAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT THEM TO DO? AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESEARCH THAT SAYS THAT EVERY SINGLE STEP THAT YOU FORCE THE USER TO TAKE BETWEEN THE BEGINNING A ON THE OUT COOPER THE DESIRED OUTCOME MAKES THEM LESS LIKELY TO FINISH SO IF YOU. TALK ABOUT IT THAT IN THIS CASE IF WE'RE SAYING WE WANT TO PER FOR PEOPLE TO USE A CALCULATOR THAT MEANS THAT EVERY. NUMBER THAT THEY HAVE TO PUSH ON THE CALCULATOR MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO FINISH AND MORE LIKELY THAT THEY'RE JUST GOING TO SAY TO HECK WITH IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. HOW TO CALCULATE THIS RAID AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT THAT WOULD BE MARKETED AS TO WHY -- THOUSAND IS BETTER THAN A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS BETTER THAN THOUSAND BECAUSE I WOULD A MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THE VOTER HAS TO DO TO GET IT TO GET TO AN ACCURATE ANSWER. AND THIS IS AND THERE WASN'T A SPECIFIC INCIDENT NO IT WAS JUST YOUR THIS IS IN GENERAL TERMS YOU EAT YOUR PURE AUTHOR HIS BILL BECAUSE YOU PERCEIVE IT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE VOTER TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT. TO TAKE ON AND ON YES AND AS I'M SURE MOST THE PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE NO I I'VE A LONG -- INTEREST IN THIS. IN THIS FIELD I'VE HAD A NUMBER OF BILLS. THAT THE IN THIS AREA IN FACT THE REQUIREMENT TO PUTTHAT. OUR TAX RATE ON THE STATEMENT CAME FROM THE BILL THAT I AUTHORED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- I HAVE A DEEP INTEREST IN ART CONTINUED TO TO LOOK AT AS THE REFORMS WE PUT IN PLACE HAVE OR HAVE ROLLED OUT TO SEE WHAT TWEAKS NEED TO BE MADE. TO MAKE IT MORE EFFECTIVE IN THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED -- I FOUND MYSELF GOING BACK AND FORTH BEFORE BEFORE YOU YOU ASKED FOR A MEETING AND I HAD SAT DOWN AND DID A LOT OF CALCULATIONS I WAS GOING TO BE SATISFIED WITH A THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THEN WHEN I ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND DID IT THAT WAS WHEN I CAME TO THE CAN I CAN'T READ MY CONCLUSION WHICH I THINK IS THAT THE DOLLARS EASIER FOR TRYING TO MAKE IT. EASY FOR VOTERS AND GET ACCURACY -- BUT IF. YOU WANTED TO TO OFFER UP TO CHANGE IT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS -- I WOULD NOT -- THAT WOULD SUPPORT THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVER THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF IN USING OUR EXAMPLE THREATEN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR HOUSE. IF YOU EXPRESS A PER THOUSAND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MULTIPLY BY THREE SEVENTY FIVE I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR SO -- I WILL -- I WILL COMMIT TO TAKING THAT AMENDMENT TO MAKE IT PER THOUSAND DOLLARS CAD PER. HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WITH THAT AMENDMENT -- I'LL CHANGE MY RECOMMENDATION FROM A NOTE. I KEEP IT IS A NON -- BUT I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT THANK YOU. FOR A SECOND. THERE'S PROBABLY SOME PROCEDURE THAT WE NEED TO TO GET THIS RIGHT [inaudible] TO JOINT JOHN IN CASE THE ORIGINAL MOTION IS WITHDRAWN -- THERE IS YOU WANNA MAKE A NEW MOTION. SECOND. WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT IS A FAT PER THOUSAND INSTEAD OF PER HUNDRED THOUSAND SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND -- ANY ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS PLEASE DODD WEBER. FIND THIS RATHER HUMOROUS. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE MOVING TO THAT TO THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE I I GUESS IT IS IT IS A BETTER CALCULATION. I JUST FIND IT HUMOROUS BECAUSE IT'S TO TALK ABOUT THE SAD STATE OF MATHEMATICS IN OUR YES IT DOES WE HAVE THAT CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. WE WENT BUT I THOUGHT MY GOD HERE WE GOT TO THIS POINT YOU KNOW WHERE -- YOU KNOW IT I FEEL LIKE I MADE ONE OF THE FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS WITH THE YOUNG LADY HAS TO TRULY PUSH IN EVERYTHING THAT SHE CAN'T GIVE ME CHANGE AND I'VE HAD. TO HOLD HER HAND IF TELLER WHAT THE GIVEN A SELL OUT ANYWAY IT'S INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BREAKING THE BILL FOR JUST. DOCTOR WEBER THAT'S A CONVERSATION THE MISTER WILL THERE ARE OBERNOLTE AND I HAD YESTERDAY. YEAH -- AND YOU SEE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH ME I THINK THIS TO BE GOOD FOR TRANSPARENCY AND I'D REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- I DID THERE'S NO MORE FOR ME TO SAY -- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE VOTE. BERMAN HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON CALDERON I LOW. WELL I MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER HI THAT BILL IS OUT ON A SEVEN TO ZERO VOTE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU. NEXT OF A SINISTER BONTA. WITHOUT A NUMBER ONE AB. TWO TWENTY MORE MATURE AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT A. B. TWO TWENTY WHICH WILL HELP PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE. AND INCREASED GENDER PARITY AMONG PUBLIC ELECTED OFFICIALS. BY AUTHORIZING THE USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS THE MONEY RAISED BY CANDIDATES FOR OFFICE TO BE USED FOR CHILDCARE EXPENSES THAT ARE INCURRED DUE TO CAMPAIGNING AND WHILE SERVING IN OFFICE CANDIDATE WITH YOUNG CHILDREN OFTEN FACE THE PRACTICAL REALITY. OF PAIN FOR INCREASED CHILD CARE IN ORDER TO CAMPAIGN IN NETWORK WHEN RUNNING FOR OFFICE. JUST LOOK [inaudible] THANK YOU. THIS IS A LOT OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL. HELLO ONE SECOND THANK YOU THIS ALLOWED THE FEDERAL LEVEL ONE MAKE SURE IT'S ALSO ALLOWED AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THAT IT'S CLEAR. AND I WANT TO THANK AB THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION FOR THEIR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING ON LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THAT CAMPAIGN FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR CHILD CARE EXPENSES THAT. DIRECTLY RESULTS FROM CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES OR OFFICIAL DUTIES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FROM AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY IS AMBER MALTBY A CAMPAIGN FINANCE ATTORNEY AND ADVOCATE FOR GENDER PARITY AMONG ELECTED OFFICIALS GREAT. PLEASE. THANK YOU I'M SO I AM HERE TODAY I'M A PARTNER WITH THE LAW FIRM LAST MAN BUT I'M NOT HERE REPRESENTING. ANY PARTICULAR CLIENT BUT RATHER TO SPEAK FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE BEEN -- ADVISING -- CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL CANDIDATES ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. I'M FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS I'VE WORKED WITH -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE -- THE RECRUITMENT AND ELECTION OF WOMEN TO OFFICE OF PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. AND OVER THE COURSE OF THAT EXPERIENCE I FIND THAT THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS A TWO FOLD. NUMBER ONE I'M JUST SIMPLE CLARITY AND THE LAW THE FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION HAS BEEN ADVISING THINGS LIKE THE NINETEEN NINETY IS THAT CANDIDATES CAN USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS. FOR CHILDCARE WHEN THEY'RE CAMPAIGNING HOWEVER -- ADVICE LETTERS ARE NOT PRESIDENTIAL WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT -- A CANDIDATE IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHO RELIES ON A TO AN ADVICE LETTER FROM. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR COULD BE PROSECUTED BY THE TWENTY NINETEEN F. PPC BECAUSE IT'S A NEW CONVENTION A NEW GENERAL COUNSEL -- A NEW INTERPRETATION SO BY CODIFYING THE ADVISORS AND EXCITING A CLEAR STANDARD THAT GIVES NOT ONLY CANDIDATES AND FRANKLY THOSE OF US WHO ADVISE CANDIDATES. CLARITY ON WHAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT DEAL WITH CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- IT ALSO GIVES OF THE F. PPC -- NEEDED GUIDANCE AS WELL. THE SECOND REASON THIS BILL IS NEEDED IS -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA MENTION CANDIDATES FACE THE VERY PRACTICAL REALITY THAT. THERE IS A PERSONAL EXPENSE RELATED TO RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND FOR WOMEN -- THE DECISION TO RUN FOR OFFICE OR CARE FOR CHILDREN IS OFTEN ONE THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE EARLY ON AND WHAT. I FIND -- I'VE I WAS CHAIRED THE EMERGE CALIFORNIA BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS I'VE BEEN TRAINING. THE PROGRAM CLASS -- FOR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS NOW EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- WE SEE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WOMEN -- DECLINED TO RUN UNTIL THEIR CHILDREN ARE GROWN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE SO THIS BILL NOT ONLY -- PERMITS MORE GENDER EQUITY IN OFFICE BUT ALSO SUPPORTS ADAM. A YOUNG PARENTS WITH CHILDREN RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND FOR THOSE REASONS I I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT AB TWO TWENTY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT HAD A CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEAL GIVES WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE FOR THE REASONS STATED -- WELL YES THIS IS ALSO A A GREAT BILL FOR WOMEN THIS THIS AFFECTS ALL GENDERS AS A YOUNG PARENT MYSELF -- THE NUMBER OF TIMES I THOUGHT YOU KNOW WHAT. I'D LIKE TO RUN FOR OFFICE SAID AT AT BUT THE THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TO PAY. BUT I JUST I I APPRECIATE THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A COMMONSENSE MEASURE THAT THAT WILL CREATE GREATER DIVERSITY -- IN OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS OF THAT -- WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DISREGARD THE POLITICAL ADVICE HE GOT FROM A THE MEMBER ASIA ON THE LONG ON BEHALF SECRETARY STATE ALEX BUT THE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR FELL UPON OF HAVE THE FOR PUBLIC PRACTICE MISSION A TWEENER SURE INFAMOUS TWEENER CATEGORY -- WE'RE SUPPORTIVE AMENDED -- WERE VERY CLOSE TO GETTING TO OUR SUPPORT POSITION WE WENT TAKE -- AS MALTBY IN MISTER BONTA AND HIS STAFF FOR THE GREAT AND PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WE WE'VE HAD IN REGARDS -- TO DEALING WITH ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR ANALYSIS -- WE I THINK THE COMMISSION I STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE POLICY WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DEAL WITH THOSE FINER DETAILS -- TO DEAL WITH REASON BEFORE SIEBEL WE BELIEVE ABUSES THAT COULD OCCUR -- BECAUSE THIS -- DAYCARE AND AND CHILD CARE IS INHERENTLY PERSONAL OB THAT IT BENEFITS CANDIDATES PERSONALLY AND SO THERE'S THERE'S MANY LAWS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW THAT THAT -- TRY TO PREVENT PREVENT OR PROHIBIT PERSONAL USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS WHICH IS TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND WERE VERY CLOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND HE IS NO WITNESSES TRAINERS ANYTHING BRING ABOUT A COLLEGE HER QUESTION ACCOUNT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS A MISTER CALDERON THEN LOOKS LIKE MISTER LOVE -- ONE THANK YOU FOR THE GUYS BUT I ACTUALLY HAD A LONG CONVERSATION YESTERDAY MY OFFICE -- AFTER WE WERE DONE WITH ALL MY WORK OUR WORK -- WITH MY CHIEF OF STAFF OF APPARENTLY LEGISLATORS ARE SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS -- AND YOU KNOW. I LOOK AT THIS FOR AS A MULLIN AS A MILLENNIAL THE FIRST MULLIN ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHEN I RAN FOR OFFICE I WAS. TWENTY FIVE AND ALL I GET. I I WORKED -- AND ALL I COULD DO -- WHICH WAS DEVICE WAS TO GET ALONE IN ORDER TO TO HOLD ME OVER TO PAY FOR MY EXPENSES -- IN THE TIME THAT I NEED TO TAKE WORK OFF TO CAMPAIGN FULL TIME AS IT GOT CLOSER TO THE UP TO THE ELECTION I CAN ONLY APPROVED FOR THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN. I AND SO IT IT IT IT EXPANDED THE TIME THE LENGTH OF TIME. THAT -- I HAD TO WORK WHILE MY OPPONENTS WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE -- TO WORK -- CAMPAIGN FULL TIME I HAD TO WORK A LITTLE BIT LONGER HAD I BEEN IN A POSITION WHERE I HAD KIDS AT THAT TIME. IT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT. DISADVANTAGE FOR ME BECAUSE A LOT OF THE TIMES OF THE VENTS THAT I ATTEND EVEN OUT TODAY OF OTHERS AS A LEGISLATOR -- ARE PREDICATED UPON WHETHER I CAN HAVE MY FAMILY WITH ME OR NOT -- WHETHER IT'S ATTENDING A CONFERENCE WHETHER IT'S ATTENDING ANYTHING -- OUR JOB RELY ON US TO BE PLACES TO LEARN ABOUT ISSUE AREAS TO GET THE CONTACTS THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO TAKE A VOTE -- TO RENDER A DECISION ON A VOTE WHILE ALSO AT THE SAME TIME DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS ARE GONNA HELP US MAKE MAKE US MORE SUCCESSFUL WHEN IT COMES TO PUSHING DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT DON'T MATTER JUST TO US. BECAUSE WE RAN TO RUN WE WE WE RAN TO WORK ON CERTAIN ISSUES BUT ALSO ISSUES THAT FACE. CALIFORNIANS AND SO -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I DID BACKWARDS -- IN A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE RUN HAVE KIDS THEY HAVE THEIR OF HOUSE STATE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALREADY MARRIED I WASN'T I WASN'T MARRIED AND HAVE KIDS AT IN ON A HOME I DID ALL THAT STUFF -- WHILE I WAS IN OFFICE -- BUT NOW TODAY. IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS ME THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT I WOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BUT I THINK -- THAT -- THERE ARE A LOT OF CANDIDATES THAT ARE DETERRED FROM RUNNING FOR OFFICE BECAUSE OF THIS AND A LOT OF LEGISLATORS THAT HAVE YOUNG KIDS THAT UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS AT WORK ON SEVEN MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. EVERY SINGLE YEAR YOU PUT A LOT ON YOUR SPOUSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR SPOUSE ISN'T COMING OUT WITH YOU TO SACRAMENTO WHEN YOU KNOW LIKE IN MY SITUATION -- MY FAMILY'S IN LA -- EVEN THOUGH THE WITH ME THIS WEEK WHICH IS GREAT HAS BEEN REALLY NICE -- AND AND SO THEY'RE JUST A LOT OF DIFFERENT DYNAMICS I GO INTO HOW THIS COULD DETER I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE IT ADD OUR CURRENT POLICIES COULD COULD DETER YOUNG PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO SEEK OFFICE ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE YOUNG KIDS -- AND SO I I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IT ISN'T AN ISSUE IT IT IS IN A DIFFICULT ISSUE NOT NOT BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFICULT POLICY TO SUPPORT THE DIFFERENT DIFFICULT POLITICAL ISSUE TO SUPPORT. AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE NOT THE SYMPATHETIC CHARACTERS BUT I I I I I DO APPLAUD YOU TAKING ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT IMPACTS A LOT OF PEOPLE. ARE AND ME AND AND I THINK THAT -- WE WANT TO WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ENCOURAGE -- THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST ESPECIALLY THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST FROM THE NEXT GENERATION AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A SYSTEM. OF OF WHERE YOU HAVE CANDIDATES THAT DON'T HAVE KIDS THAT ARE MORE ENCOURAGED TO RUN THE CANDIDATES THAT DO HAVE KIDS ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE YOUNG BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT PRESENTS BECAUSE IT'S NOT EASY. TO DO IT IS NOT CHEAP -- AND HAVING A LITTLE EXTRA HELP I THINK COULD IT COULD HELP MOTIVATE YOUNG CANDIDATES TO TO RUN FOR OFFICE SO THANK YOU FOR SUPPORT APPRECIATE THAT IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER MAJORITY LEADER. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND A LINE MY COMMENTS ALSO WITH A MISTER CALDERON ON ADDRESSING THE PARITY OF THAT THIS PROVIDES -- AND JUST A CLARIFICATION ON QUESTION JUST GIVEN THAT MISS CAMPAIGN ATTORNEY AND TRYING TO FIND IN OUNCES IN THE COMING OFFICE WITH RESPECT TO THAT OF THE FISHEL CAMPAIGN DUTIES IN THE OFFICE HOLDER EXPENSES AS YOU WELL KNOW -- MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ASSEMBLY PARTICULAR ARE UP FOR ELECTION EVERY TWO YEARS SO. SORT OF CAMPAIGNING NONSTOP. ACTUALLY SO HAVING SAID THAT IS THERE A DISTINCTION WITH RESPECT TO THE BILL AND HAND OFFICE HOLDOVERS OF THAT OF CAN AND IT WAS AT ONE IN THE SAME. I THINK THAT -- DO YOU WANT. TO LOOK GOOD AND I'M I I THINK THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE WHAT AT THAT AT THE KEY ISSUES THAT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FINE TUNE AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT I THINK YOU KNOW WITH. WITH THE CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY. IT'S A LITTLE MORE CLEAR WHEN SOMETHING IS -- TEASER LEGAL TERM BUT FOR THE CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO USE ARE YOU NOT HAVE -- TO USE CHILD CARE -- FOR OFFICIAL DUTIES -- YEP IF YOU HAVE A FULL TIME JOB AND THEN YOU GET ELECTED YOU HAVE ANOTHER FULL TIME JOB. AND SO -- YOU WERE WORKING WITH THE F. T. P. SEAT TO FINE TUNE THE LANGUAGE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT. ESSENTIALLY JUST CHANGING ONE FULL TIME JOB TO ANOTHER -- IN USING CAMPAIGN FUNDS DURING THAT BUT RATHER YOU KNOW WHEN -- YOU. HOW YOU TAILOR THAT THAT'S SORT OF WHAT WE'RE WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW BUT BUT I? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TACKLING AT THE MOMENT. YES. I THINK THE PART OF THE AGAIN THE THE THE INTENT LEGEND TEN AS WELL RECOGNIZE BUT HOW DO WE DISTINGUISH THAT OF THE OFFICE HOLDER COUNT VERSE THAT OF THE CAMPAIGN REELECT ACCOUNT AND MY UNDERSTANDING YOU CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IT'S IT'S ONE IN THE SAME OFFICE HOLD. ACCOUNT CAN BE USED IS THE SAME SO WHEN IS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF OFFICIAL DUTIES SO. AS OFFICIAL DUTIES I MAY AS ONE SHOULD THIS BILL BECOME LAW. COULD AN INDIVIDUAL OFFICEHOLDER. USED THAT -- WALL AND OFFICIAL CAPACITY OF THE OFFICE OR ACCOUNT VERSUS THE DISTINCTION OF THE CANDIDATE ACCOUNT BUT IT'S ONE OF THE SAME RIGHT RIGHT FROM -- I DON'T THINK WELL IT USED TO BE IF THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT HOW THE IT WOULD BE YEARS RIGHT. YOU KNOW HOW CAMPAIGN FUNDS CAN BE YEARS FROM THE CANDIDATE ACCOUNT THE OFFICE HOLDER ACCOUNT AND EVEN THE CANDIDATE CONTROLLED BALLOT MEASURE IT COMMITTEE ACCOUNT EACH IS SUBJECT TO THEIR OWN ROLES SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE GO BACK AND TALK TO THAT OF PPC. SURE ABOUT YES MAYBE JUST. YEAH I MEAN I I WOULD I WOULD SAY FRANKLY IN IN CRAFTING THIS BILL. I WAS CONTEMPLATING THAT. THE THE THE CAMPAIGN MONEY IN IT BUT NOT NOT THE OFFICE HOLDER. ACCOUNT OF HOW MANY FOLKS HAVE BOTH -- BUT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE REELECTION. I AM COMMITTEE FUNDS AND THAT WOULD BE USED BOTH FOR A CAMPAIGN RELATED ACTIVITY AND FOR OFFICIAL DUTIES JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR IT YOU KNOW IT'S BROUGHT IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL YOU YOU DO HAVE A CAMPAIGN HAD THAT YOU WEAR. IF YOUR FACIAL DUTY HAT THEN INTO THE EXTENT EITHER OF THOSE HATS I REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE IT COULD BE PAID FOR BY AIR YOUR REELECTION COMMITTEE THAT'S THE IDEA -- BUT YOU BASICALLY QUESTION OF OF OF NEW WANTS THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO ADDRESS WITH FUTURE MA'AM JUST TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I THINK IT'S GONNA BE IMPORTANT IN THIS BILL THIS HOPE. THE WHOLE PURPOSE FOR THIS BILL TO PROVIDE CLARITY. SO THAT THERE'S GUIDANCE AND OFFICIALS KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO SO. THANK YOU FOR FOR RAISING THAT HE WANTS WILL SEEK TO ADDRESS IN THE FUTURE YES YES THIS IS MY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY OFFICE HOLDER KIND OF CAMPAIGN. LIKE HOW DOES ONE OF THE SAME RIGHT SO OF PERHAPS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AND AT FOR CLARITY TO WHICH YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE CHIEF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER LOWE GREATNESS ROSTER. YES SO I MEAN I KIND OF STRUGGLE WITH THIS A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE YOU KNOW ON THE ONE HAND. I THINK WE ALL MAKE SACRIFICES WE RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE WHETHER WE HAVE. YOU KNOW YOUNG KIDS ARE NOT LIKE WE ALL HAVE PERSONAL THINGS. THAT WE DO HAVE TO SACRIFICE YOU KNOW TO DO THESE JOBS I DON'T THINK THAT REALLY MAKES THIS. ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- ALSO YOU KNOW THEY HAVE JOBS THEY HAVE YOU KNOW DEMANDING. SCHEDULES AND OBLIGATIONS AFTER ME. AND GUESS WHAT THEY HAVE TO MANAGE HOW TO FIGURE OUT CHILD CARE AND THAT'S A BIG DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW -- HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HELP. YOU KNOW PEOPLE WITH. WITH THAT ISSUE AND IT IT JUST SEEMS A LITTLE BIT LIKE WERE KIND OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE CAMPAIGN FUNDS THAT WE REYES. YOU KNOW -- EARLY TO HELP OUR ELECTION EFFORTS -- YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GIVING US. DONATIONS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN YOU AS A CANDIDATE AND I WANT TO HELP YOU GET ELECTED. AND SO YOU KNOW PRIMARILY THAT'S THE IDEAS HEY THAT'S FOR ELECTIONEERING THINGS NOW CAN I SEE THAT. HEY AND LOOK I HAVE FIVE YOUNG CHILDREN. IT'S HARD NOT TO TAKE MYSELF PERSONALLY OUT OF THIS RIGHT -- I CAN'T AFFORD A NANNY -- BUT WE HAVE WE WE DEFINITELY IS A LOT OF BABY SITTERS AND AND PROBABLY MY BABY SITTING. MY OUT OF MY BUDGET IS PRETTY HIGH HIGHER THAN A MAYBE LIKE IT TO BE -- BUT YOU KNOW COULD I SEE THAT A DONOR MAYBE IS LIKE OH HEY YOU KNOW AND HELPING YOU. I CAN MAYBE ALSO HELP YOU AS YOU'RE OUT CAMPAIGNING YOU KNOW HELPING WITH WITH CHILD CARE YEAH PROBABLY MOST MY DOLLARS AND SAVE. I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THAT THAT MUCH RIGHT -- BUT BUT THE SAME TIME AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC YOU KNOW THEY HAVE JOBS I GOT TO GO TO AN ANDIN A LESSER ELIGIBLE FOR A PROGRAM NOBODY'S PAYING FOR THEIR CHILD CARE. YOU KNOW AND THEY DON'T HAVE A FUND. TO HELP THEM PAY FOR THEIR CHILD CARE -- SO FROM THAT CIRCUMSPECT THAT FEEL LIKE ARE WE KIND OF MAKING OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT SPECIAL. IN THAT CASE -- AND AND I GET THE GENDER PARITY ISSUE. BUT YEAH THERE'S ALSO THEIR SINGLE DADS THE OTHERS MARRIED MARRIED COUPLES THAT STRUGGLE TO FIGURE OUT CHILD CARE -- TO IT'S NOT JUST. YOU KNOW ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE AND AGAIN ALL OF US HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND PERSONAL EXPENSES. THAT WE INCUR DOING THESE JOBS SO WHY SHOULD WE CORDON OFF ONE THING SO I STRUGGLE WITH THAT PART A LITTLE BIT -- BUT THEN I THINK THE SECOND PART IS IT DOESN'T IS GET A LITTLE BIT MESSY RIGHT BECAUSE HOW DO WE DETERMINE LIKE OKAY THIS CHILD CARE WAS FOR A CAMPAIGN EVENT. AS OPPOSED TO I'M JUST PAYING YOUR CHILD CARE BILL. YOU KNOW FOR THE FULL YEAR EVERYBODY HAS CHILD CARE THAT THEY YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW WELL MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY BUT EVERYBODY HAS CHILD CARE EXPENSES OR A PARENT IS SPENDING A LOT OF TIME. TAKING OVER THAT ROLE AND IT'S NOT AS AS I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST IS NOT AN EASY ROLE TO FILL. EVERYBODY'S DOING THAT IN SOME -- CIRCUMSTANCE -- ARE WE GOING TO USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO COVER WHAT WOULD BE YOUR BASIC CHILD CARE. FUNDS BASIC CHILDCARE EXPENSES JUST AS THEY WOULD BE EVEN IF YOU WEREN'T ELECTED -- OR IS IT ONLY FOR THE CAMPAIGN SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S ONLY. FOR LEGITIMATE CAMPAIGN RELATED. EXPENSES BUT THEN WHEN YOU GO ON AUDIT THAT HOW DO YOU HOW TO HOW DOES ONE DIFFERENTIATE THAT -- I THINK THAT COULD BE KIND OF MESSY AND DIFFICULT IN THE COULD MAYBE MUDDY THE WATERS THE EVEN MORE SO. ARE THESE THIS IS WHAT I'M KIND OF STRUGGLING TO CONCEIVE ON BOTH SIDES BUT I THINK THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY THERE. WE GRAY POINTED OUT. DIDN'T IT JUST BROKE REAL BRIEFLY I APPRECIATE YOUR POINTS YOU KNOW AM AND I'VE GIVEN THOUGHT TO IT TO EACH OF THEM. AND YOU KNOW IT'S ELECTED OFFICIALS WITH CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS IT IT'S IT'S A YOU IT'S A UNIQUE I AM. IN A PART OF FUNDS THAT ARE THAT ARE UNIQUE TO ELECTED OFFICIALS RAN FOR OFFICE NOT AT NIGHT WHEN HOUSING I AGREE -- BUT IT'S NOT JUST FREE MONEY I MEET YOUR YOUR YOUR REACHING OUT YOUR TO YOUR YOUR POTENTIAL DONORS YOUR LOVE ONES YOUR SUPPORTERS THAT YOU'RE RAISING IT. AND THEY WANT YOU TO BE A SUCCESSFUL LOOK AT OFFICIAL IT MEANS BEING OUT ON AS YOU KNOW NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS AND AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY -- AND THEY WHITE THEIR BEST AND YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL THE REPRESENT THEM TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY. SO I CAN'T GET THE MIND OF EVERY DONOR -- THAT THAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO CAMPAIGN FINE BUT I I THINK GENERALLY THEY BELIEVE IN. THE CANDIDATE THE SUPPORTING AND WHAT THAT PERSON BE SUCCESSFUL IN. A TO ACCEPT BEARS TO REMOVE TO MAKE THEM ABOUT ELECTED OFFICIALS I THINK THEY WOULD. SUPPORT THAT AND YOU KNOW THAT THE HORSE IS ALREADY LEFT A STABLE BOTH AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE STATE LEVEL ON WHETHER THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE CAMPAIGN EXPENSE IT'S IT'S CLEARLY APPROPRIATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL CONGRESS PEOPLE CAN DO THIS NOW -- DOESN'T VICE LETTER -- THAT SAID YOU CAN DO IT AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT AS A MISS MOBY INDICATED THAT'S THAT'S NOT SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY WE WANT TO BE MORE CLEAR. SAID IS NOT A LOT OF DEBATE ON WHETHER IT'S AN APPROPRIATE EXPENSE WERE JUST TRYING TO GET THE THE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THIS WILL CERTAINLY INCREASE GENDER PARITY. BUT NOT ONLY GENDER PARITY IT'LL IT'LL POP UP PROVIDE ENOUGH THREE FOR MORE PARENTS TO BE AN OFFICE AND THAT'S A GREAT THING. WHEN I WAS FIRST RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL I SAW A LOT OF RETIRED FOLKS OF FOLKS THAT WITHOUT KIDS -- WEALTHIER FOLKS AND I SAID WERE YOU KNOW I THINK IT BECAUSE THERE IS A DOWN ON THAT COUNCIL WITH YOUNG KIDS WHO WHO I WAS. IN IT I BROUGHT A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON AS WE REYES GET TO MAKE IT POLICIES THAT AFFECT FAMILIES WITH KIDS AND AND AND AND OUR CHILDREN EVERY DAY AND IT AND TO HAVE OUR OWN KIDS AND HAVE THE EXPERIENCE I THINK MAKES US BETTER POLICY MAKERS. IT'S OUR LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT WE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE WHEN WE MAKE POLICY DECISIONS. AND ON YOUR LAST POINT THAT'S EXACTLY THE ISSUE THAT MISTER THAT THE CHURCH ARE BERMAN IS HAS REYES WITH US TACTIC PROVIDE CLARITY. ON A WHAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED AND WHAT ISN'T IF YOU'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR CHILDCARE BEFORE YOU EVER RUN FOR OFFICE AND THEN YOU START RUNNING FOR OFFICE. YOU OUGHT NOT BE ABLE TO USE YOUR YOUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR WHAT YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE BEFORE YOU START RUNNING FOR OFFICE BUT IF YOU'RE FROM THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND YOU COME UP TO SACRAMENTO FORTIES WE CAN YOU NEED TO GET ADDITIONAL CHILD CARE TO MAKE IT WORK FOR YOUR FAMILY -- TIP TO PERFORM OFFICIAL DUTIES THAT PROBABLY CAN'T AND WE WANT TO PUT THE LANGUAGE IN HERE THAT WILL HELP CAPTURE THAT. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE LINE IS DRAWN AT THERE IS CLARITY FOR ENFORCING AND FOR AUDITING AND FOR EVERYTHING ELSE SO WE'RE WE'RE GONNA WORK ON THAT IN. A CHAIR BERMAN HAS GIVEN INSTRUCTION TO DO THAT WE WILL. THIS MESSAGE. I THINK I DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN -- SO THIS THERE IS NO -- CONFLICT FOR ME IS NOT LIKE HEY THIS BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO OF TO HAVE CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR FOR CHILD CARE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN -- BUT I CAN SEE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. IN WHICH THE LINE IS ALREADY BLURRED -- BUT IMAGINE I'M IF YOU'RE OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL -- AND YOU'VE GOT CAMPAIGN STAFF THAT ARE WORKING FOR YOU AND YOU'VE GOT SOME OF THAT AND YOU SAY HEY CAN YOU WATCH MY CHILDREN AND FOR AN HOUR WATCH MY CHILDREN FOR TWO HOURS. I'M SURE THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING -- TODAY -- AND THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARITY AND SO I'M I'M THANKFUL FOR YOU FOR BRINGING THIS THIS FORD -- I THINK IT MAKES ABSOLUTE -- ABSOLUTE SENSE AND THERE IS. AN INCREDIBLE COST TO RUNNING FOR FOR POLITICAL OFFICE -- AND THERE ARE SOME -- WHO ARE MARRIED BUT THEY HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE ONE SPOUSE THEY CAN WATCH AT THE CHILD YOU'VE GOT OTHERS THEIR SINGLE PARENTS ON THE DON'T HAVE THAT ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT? I DO THINK THAT THAT PROVIDE SOME SOME PARITY SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL A TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER MASON. BUT WEBER. I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR THE CONVERSATION -- I'M NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THIS I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND ONLY BECAUSE YEAH I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN A PROFESSIONAL MY WHOLE LIFE AND I'VE HAD CHILDREN AND RESPONSIBILITY. AND THEY WERE MY RESPONSIBILITY -- I NEVER FELT THAT OF THE ANYBODY -- SHOULD PAY FOR MUCH SHOP HERE. OF WHEN I WENT TO WORK OR EVEN WHEN I CAMPAIGN BECAUSE THAT'S ALL PART OF A JOB AND SO. I'M NOT SURE IF SOMETIMES WE TRY TO TAKE ON TOO MUCH WITHOUT REALIZING THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MALES AND FEMALES IN THE AREA SHOP YEAR PERIOD. AND IT'S NOT AN EASY TASK AND I STRUGGLE EVERY DAY WITH MY STAFF WHO CAN'T AFFORD SHOP HERE. AND I'M ASKING THEM TO DO THINGS AT NIGHT. ON WEEKENDS YOU KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AND AND MANY OF THEM DON'T FALL INTO THE CATEGORY EVEN DOING THE REGULAR DAY IF THEY QUALIFY. FOR FOR OUR SUBSIDIES AND FREE YOU KNOW KIND OF REDUCE CHOP HERE SO I HAVE I HAVE. YOUNG STAFF THAT STRUGGLES IN THE DISTRICT OFFICE WITH WITH THE ISSUE OF CHOP HERE -- AND AND WE'VE TRIED VARIOUS WAYS OF CHANGING THE FORMULA HERE AND A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS SO. IT YOUR JOB IS A BIG ISSUE IN THE STATE AND I'M NOT SURE IF GIVING US LACK IS THAT GOOD BECAUSE WE MAKE MORE THAN MOST OF THE FOLKS WHO STRUGGLING WHICH OUT HERE. AT THE BECAUSE IT IS IN BETWEEN GROUP OF FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR THEY CAN'T AFFORD YOU KNOW TO DUBBED DON'T GET IN THE PRE SCHOOL SET OF SUBSIDIZED. THEY DON'T GET IN SOMETHING ELSE AND SO THEY'RE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH CHILD HERE SO I'M I'M NOT REALLY SURE ABOUT THIS I KNOW IN -- AND I HOPE IT DOESN'T GO INTO THE SLIPPERY SLOPE OF EVERYTHING THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THAT'S SOMEWHAT RELATED THAT WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING. FOR WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH NOW OF A CANDIDATE NOT A CANDIDATE BUT A AN OF CONGRESSMAN IN SAN DIEGO WHO HAS PAID FOR EVERYTHING -- YOU KNOW TUITIONS AND THIS AND THIS AND THAT. AND SO AS A RESULT HE'S JUST KIND OF ABUSE THE SYSTEM IN THE WORST KIND OF WAY BUT YET HE ARGUES THAT THIS IS A PART OF HIS WOULD BE AS A DO BECAUSE HE GOES TO WASHINGTON. AND HIS KIDS NEED TO BE IN A PRIVATE SCHOOL THE SECURED BLAH BLAH BLAH. SO YOU KNOW. SO WE PLATE THE STATE OF MEAN THEY PAID I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THOUSAND AND PRIVATE SCHOOL JOB HERE FOR HIS CHILDREN. AND THE END AND SO THAT'S GOOD AND IT'S BEING LITIGATED IN THIS BOOK OF THE BIBLE IN UP IN JAIL BUT THAT AS WELL AS A HOST OF OTHER THINGS. SO I JUST I'M JUST HOPEFUL THAT SOMEONE OF YOUR PRIVATE SOME CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS IS IMPLEMENTED. AND WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES ARE AS AS AS AS JUST PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK EVERY DAY -- IT IS NOT EASY TO HAVE CHILDREN IT IS NOT EASY TO HAVE TO OF FOR CHOPPY AND CHOP HIS BECOME EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE. EVERY DAY FOR MOST FOLKS SO. YOU KNOW AND AND AND AND I AND I AGREE THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DOESN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF IT AND I KNOW WHEN I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. WE HAVE PARENTS WHO CAME ALL THE AND THE MAIN ISSUE WAS CHILDCARE CHILDCARE CHILD. I HAD THE SAME ISSUE I WAS A YOUNG WITH AT THE TIME ON THE SCHOOL BOARD I HAD CHOPPY ISSUES TOO BUT I FIGURED OUT YOU KNOW AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE'S JOB TO FIGURE IT OUT. SO THAT I COULD COME TO SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS I DO THINGS AT NIGHT THAT I HAD TO I HAD TO FIGURE IT OUT MYSELF I HAD AND MY HUSBAND HAD FIGURED OUT HE WAS VERY ACTIVE IN SO WE TRAVELED A LOT BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS A PART. OF OUR LIFE IT BECAME AN EXPENSE SO I I'M I'M I'M COME IN AND AND BILL. AND AMBIVALENT WITH REGARD TO THIS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT BUT I'M HOPING THAT. THERE'S SOME CLARITY THAT COMES IN THAT MAKES SENSE FOR IT SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH THIS. THIS THIS SELF FEELING THAT UP -- WE HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT FOLKS HAVE. ARE AND AND AND YET AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT SENSITIVETO THE TO THE SAME ISSUES OF FOLKS WHO MAKE LOT LESS THAN WE DO. WE HAVE MORE RESPONSIBILITY SOMETIMES AND WE DO AND THIS STRUGGLING EVERY DAY THAT MAKE SHOP HERE WORK FOR THEM WHY THEY TRY TO GO TO JOBS. AND THAT AREN'T AS LUCRATIVE AS OURS ARE SO I MEAN I'M REAL SENSITIVE TO THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE THAT SPECIAL -- MAYBE WE ARE BUT IN TERMS OF GETTING -- YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE THAT SUPPORTS THAT SHOP HERE WHILE WE'RE CAMPAIGNING AND DOING OTHER KINDS OF THINGS AND AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I'M HOPING THERE'S SOME. CLARITY COMES OUT OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE F. PPC FOLKS AND OTHERS. I THINK YOU HAVE TO EITHER REALLY GOOD POINT IS ALWAYS DOCKED WEBER AND JUST TO CLARIFY ONE SMALL POINT THAT YOU THAT YOU REFERENCED I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT PRIVATE SCHOOL TUITION IS NOT AN AUTHORIZED. CAN WE CONFIRM WHAT ARE THE AMENDMENTS. THERE AREN'T ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE THE THE EXISTING BILL THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO KEEP ON WORKING WITH THE F. B. PC THAT ADDITIONAL -- CAM A CLARITY TO A SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO TO YOU KNOW DEVELOP FURTHER THE THE THE SITUATIONS WHERE A CANDIDATE OR AN OFFICE HOLDER WOULD BE ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES. OF THIS OPPORTUNITY THE ONE ATTY MORE CLARITY. PLEASE GO AHEAD. YEAH WE MISTER CALDERON IT IS TOWARDS THE END OF THE BILL IF YOU HAVE THE BILL IN PRINT IT'S SECTION H. WANTED TO KIND OF CLARIFY IS WHAT'S INCLUDED IN AUTHORIZED HEALTHCARE EXPENSES WHAT'S NOT. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN KEEP ON WORKING ON WE WILL BE OUR THANKS TO THE DISCUSSION IS SUPER HELPFUL JUST REAL QUICK AND LOOK AT I THINK ONE ISSUE MIGHT JUST BE THE PERFORMING OFFICIAL DUTIES AND MAYBE AT SOME WE CAN TALK ABOUT FURTHER. IS BECAUSE YEAH WE'RE DOING A JOB. JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO DO A JOB TO AND THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET. YOU KNOW THE CHILD CARE. TAKING CARE OF AS WELL -- YOU KNOW IF IT'S DM SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO A CAMPAIGN ACTIVITY I HAVE TO BE HERE BECAUSE I'M CAMPAIGNING FOR OFFICE I THINK THAT'S MORE AND MAYBE AND MORE UNDERSTANDABLE BUT MAY FOR HEY WE'RE JUST DOING THE JOB THAT. WE SIGNED UP TO DO. I THINK THAT KIND OF PUTS US IN THAT PLACE OF WOULD JUST YOU KNOW YEAH WE HAVE A WE HAVE A UNIQUE JOB BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO I THINK KIND OF LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID EVERYBODY HAS TO FIGURE THAT OUT -- AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE THIS FOR YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS IN THAT SITUATION YOU KNOW SO. THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I WOULD BE LOOKING FOR I THINK IS WEEK AS THIS WERE TO MOVE FORWARD. WORK ON THAT. WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU FOR DISCUSSION SUPER HELPFUL WE HAVE OUR OUR OUR OUR HOMEWORK TO DO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS TO MAKE IT CLEAR AND BETTER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. WELL I I APPRECIATE THE THE CONVERSATION WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHICH I ALWAYS DO -- ALSO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE GREATER DIVERSITY AMONG CANDIDATES FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE BY SEEKING TO ADDRESS ONE POTENTIAL AND DIVERSITIES GENDER DIVERSITY IT CAN ALSO BE YOUNGER. DAD'S SINGLE THAT YOU KNOW IT IS JUST DIVERSITY IT'S IT'S NOT YOUR TYPICAL ELECTED OFFICIAL -- WHICH I ALSO EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL AS THE YOUNGEST PERSON BY TWENTY YEARS -- THE SO THAT YOU KNOW ENCOURAGING GREATER DIVERSITY AMONG CANDIDATES FOR ELECTIVE OFFICE. BY SEEKING TO ADDRESS ONE POTENTIAL BARRIER TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE. AT THE SAME TIME IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAINTAIN PROTECTIONS AGAINST CAMPAIGN FUNDS BEING CONVERTED TO PERSONAL USE -- SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH F. PPC AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO FURTHER DEFINE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH CHILD CARE EXPENSES ARE DEEMED. TO HAVE RESULTED FROM CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES OR OFFICIAL DUTIES -- AND WITH THAT COMMITMENT I'M RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS BERMAN HI. BERMAN I'D GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NOT VOTING CALDERON. CALDERON I'D LOW LOW AYE MAYES. MAYES HI MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. WEBER AYE. THAT IS OUT ON A SIX TWO ZERO VOTING RESOLUTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I CAN HEAR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF. I'M GONNA HAND OVER THE REINS TO THE VICE CHAIR THE GOOD NEWS IS WERE WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE AGENDA AND WE HAVE TWO VERY. EASY SIMPLE QUICK BILLS. LAUGHS OF THEIR MIND IT'S A GOOD ONE OKAY MISTER CHAIRMAN -- YOU HAVE. TWO BILLS I GUESS RIGHT. WE'LL START WITH AB SIX NINETY THREE SINCE I GOT A MOTION AND A SECOND. LET'S DO THAT GO AHEAD THERE'S MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES. CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION ALSO KNOWN AS SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION. IS A SAFETY NET FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO MISSED THE DEADLINE TO REGISTER TO VOTE OR UPDATE THEIR REGISTRATION. CURRENTLY A CONDITIONAL VOTER IS GIVEN A PROVISIONAL BALLOT WHICH IS PROCESS AFTER ELECTION DAY DURING THE CAMPUS PERIOD. THIS PROCESS WAS ESTABLISHED BEFORE VOTE CAL CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE WAS CERTIFIED. USING VOCALIC COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IS NOW ABLE TO VERIFY IF VOTERS ELIGIBLE IMMEDIATELY AND UPDATE THE DATABASE IN REAL TIME. THIS MEANS THAT THE SAME PROCESS TO VERIFY A CONDITIONAL REGISTRANT ELIGIBILITY THAT CURRENTLY OCCURS ON THE BACKEND AFTER THE ELECTION AFTER ELECTION DAY. CAN SIMPLY HAPPEN ON THE FRONT AND INSTEAD IN REAL TIME. THEREFORE A. B. SIX NINETY THREE WOULD AUTHORIZE AN ELECTIONS OFFICIAL TO OFFER A NON PROVISIONAL OR REGULAR BALLOT TO A CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTER IF THE OFFICIAL USES VOEPEL. TO DETERMINE THE VOTERS ELIGIBLE. VERIFY THE PERSON HAS NOT VOTED CHECK IF THEY ARE INCLUDED ON A ROSTER IN ANY OTHER COUNTY. AN UPDATE THE VOTE COUNT RECORD TO INDICATE THE PERSON HAS VOTED. IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET THEN THE VOTER WILL STILL BE ISSUED A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. THIS BILL WILL IMPROVE THE VOTER EXPERIENCE REDUCE WAIT TIMES AND LOWER THE NUMBER PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT NEED TO BE PROCESSED AFTER ELECTION DAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME IS PHILIP CHANTRY CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION. OF COURTS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PHILIP CHANTRY. AFTER COUNTY ELECTIONS MANAGER AND LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTION OFFICIALS. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK CHAIRMAN FOR OFFERING THIS BILL AND ARE EXCITED TO SPONSOR OF THE LANGUAGE WITHIN. AB SIX NINETY THREE WILL PERMIT COUNTIES TO OFFER REGULAR BALLOTS TO CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRANTS UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTIONS RAPIDLY APPROACHING THIS CHANGE WILL ALLOW ELECTION OFFICIALS TO IMMEDIATELY ADJUDICATE CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTERS AND WILL GREATLY REDUCE THE MANY CONDITIONALLY REGISTERED VOTERS. PROVISIONAL BALLOTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED PROCESS AND EDUCATED DURING THE CAMPUS PERIOD. FOR ONLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO THE STATE WIDE REGISTRATION DATABASE AND THEIR POLLING PLACES SATELLITE OFFICES OR VOTE CENTERS. UNDER THIS SPONSORED LEGISLATION WE WOULD BE ABLE TO ENSURE THE VOTER IS ELIGIBLE TO REGISTER. MAKE SURE THAT THE VOTER HAS NOT VOTED ALREADY IN ANY OTHER COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CHECK THAT THE VOTER DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE ROSTER INDEX OF A COUNTY THAT DOES NOT HAVE VOTE CENTERS. AND MARK THE VOTER IN THE STATEWIDE DATABASE INSTANTLY AS HAVING VOTED. BY FOLLOWING THIS PROCEDURE HAVING THE VOTERS BALLOT AND REGISTRATION IMMEDIATELY ADJUDICATED AND COUNTED AND INCLUDING THEIR VOTES IN THE ELECTION NIGHT RESULTS. WE WOULD BE CREATING A BETTER VOTING EXPERIENCE FOR THE VOTER REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS BEING ADJUDICATED. AND PROCESS AFTER ELECTION DAY SPEEDING UP RESULTS AND REDUCING THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON OUR ALREADY STRESSED CAMPUS PROCESSES AND TIME LINES. I SHOULD AND WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY HOWEVER THAT IF THERE'S THE SLIGHTEST AMBIGUITY ABOUT A VOTER. FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATEWIDE DATABASE IS INTERRUPTED AT ANY TIME. THAT THE VOTERS BALLOT WOULD BE PLACED IN SEALED IN AN ENVELOPE AS THERE AS THE CURRENT PROVISIONAL PROCESS IS FOR ADJUDICATION LATER WHEN WE CAN CONFIRM THE VOTERS ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE. I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND AMENDMENTS CHAIR BERMAN OFFICE HAS HAD WITH US IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE LANGUAGE ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE CA CEO OR DOES PASSAGE AND IS A STRONG SUPPORTER. AND SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BRINGS TO YOUR LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO COMPOSITION YESTERDAY STRONG SUPPORT. THE SHAMAN THE LONG ON BEHALF SECRETARY STATE ALEX BUT THE AND SUPPORT. I'M REYES LEBRON OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORT AS AMENDED. OKAY IN ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MY NAME IS CALLING BRITAIN I'M WITH THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND I'D LIKE TO READ WITH. ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES A. B. SIX NINETY THREE CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION VOTING. AS AMENDED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS LETTER WHICH WAS MARCH THE TWENTY THIRD. AB SIX NINETY THREE WOULD FACILITATE A ROMANCE REGISTRATIONS AND ENSURE THAT INELIGIBLE VOTE. COULD BE CAST IN AND COUNTED WHEN A REGISTERED THE APPLICANT APPLIES TO VOTE THE AFFIDAVIT MUST BE VERIFIED NOT ONLY FOR DUPLICATE CATION. BUT ALSO FOR LEGITIMACY OF PROVIDED ID AND DOMICILE. AB SIX NINETY THREE WOULD PROVIDE FOR INSTANT ACCEPTANCE OF AN APPLICATION BASED SOLELY UPON WHETHER OR NOT. THAT APPLICANT IS REFLECTED ON VOTE CAL CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE VOTER DATABASE. THIS IS CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF AN APPLICATION L. ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE. THE PROCESS PUT PUT IN PLACE FOR VOTER REGISTRATION CANNOT BE SAFELY SHORT CUT OR SUBVERTED WITHOUT IN CALCULABLE AN IRREPARABLE DAMAGE. TO THE INTEGRITY OF CALIFORNIA'S ELECTIONS. FURTHERMORE VOTE CAL IS RICK IS RIDDLED WITH IMPERFECTIONS AND IS AND IS NOT A RELIABLE REFERENCE TO DETERMINE AN APPLICANT'S ELIGIBILITY TO VOTE. WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION. THE E. I. P. R. C. A. DATA TEAM HAS DONE EXHAUSTIVE RESEARCH INTO VOTE CAL AND HAS DETERMINED THAT IS DEEPLY FLAWED. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED PRECIPITOUSLY WITHOUT PROPER TESTING AND WILL TAKE MANY YEARS TO MATURE. FOR EXAMPLE USING THE VOTE CAL DATA FOR LA COUNTY. IN FEBRUARY SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN E. IPCA DATA TEAM REVEALED THAT. SIX THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN SETS OF VOTERS LIKELY REGISTERED MORE THAN ONCE AT THE SAME ADDRESS THIS INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT REGISTERED THREE TIMES AND FIFTEEN REGISTERED FOUR TO FIVE TIMES. AT THE SAME ADDRESS. SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT CENTS A VOTERS LIKELY REGISTERED AT TWO DIFFERENT ADDRESSES IN LA. AND THAT INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR REGISTERED THREE TIMES AT DIFFERENT ADDRESSES. REGISTERED VOTERS IN BOTH LA AND SENATE SAN DIEGO COUNTY INCLUDED EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE SETS. AND PUT LA IN ORANGE COUNTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN IN KERN COUNTY. THIRTY SEVEN REGISTERED IN BOTH LA AND RIVERSIDE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY REGISTERED IN BOTH LA AND SAN BERNADINE OUT ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO VOTERS. REGISTERED IN BOTH LA COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA. FORTY TWO REGISTERED IN BOTH LA COUNTY AND VENTURA TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE ALSO LIKELY DC VOTERS IN LA COUNTY. COUNTY WERE STILL I HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AND REMOVED FROM THE VOTER ROLLS. ON VOTE CAL DATABASE. BESIDES BEING CHAOTIC AND ON MAINTAINED VOTE CAL IS ALSO MISSING IMPORTANT INFORMATION. NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE VOTER ELIGIBILITY AND DISTINGUISH ONE APPLICATION FROM ANOTHER. USING THE SAME VOTE CAL LAST A ET I SEE A DATA ANALYST IDENTIFIED. SIXTY NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY LA COUNTY REGISTRANTS WITH NO ACCURATE DATE OF BIRTH. NOT USE ME [inaudible] NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO LA COUNTY REGISTRANTS WITH MISSING FIRST NAMES. AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN LA COUNTY REGISTRANTS WITH MISSING LAST NAMES. APART FROM PROPOSING UNWISE RELIANCE ON VOTE CAL. AB SIX NINETY THREE DOES NOT INCLUDE WHO WOULD BE MAKING ALEXIAN DAY DECISIONS. VERIFICATION CANNOT BE GAINED BY JUST A SIMPLE ONE STEP QUERY. EVEN USING ADVANCED PROGRAMS FUZZY LOGIC AND TRAINED PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS. GETTING RELIABLE INFORMATION FROM VOTE CAL IS DIFFICULT AS WELL AS TIME AND LABOR INTENSIVE WORK. NOR DOES AB SIXTY THREE INCLUDE. INDICATE HOW ELECTION DAY DECISIONS WOULD BE MADE. THERE IS NO MENTION OF SEARCH CRITERIA TO BE USED. DATE OF BIRTH AND NAMES ARE QUESTIONABLE CRITERIA GIVEN THAT VOEPEL. HAS BEEN SHOWN TO THE JURY. WE HAVE A COPY OF THIS LETTER ENTIRE LETTER IN FRONT OF US YEAH WE DO WE DO HAVE THE LETTER SO IF IF YOU. COULD WRAP UP OKAY OUT AND SHIP YOUR LAST LAST PARAGRAPH IS. ALL QUALIFIED ROSE. REGISTRANTS -- DESERVED TO CAST A VOTE AND HAVE IT COUNTED. THEY ALSO DESERVE A VOTE WITHIN THE SYSTEM THAT PROTECTS THEIR VOTE FROM BEING DILUTED. BY HASTILY ACCEPTED VOTES THAT MAY NOT BE A LEGITIMATE. LAST MINUTE REGISTRATIONS REGISTRANTS MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME LEVEL OF SCRUTINY THAT ALL OTHERS. AND UNTIL PROPER PROCEDURES CAN BE FOLLOWED THEY MUST BE ALLOWED TO CAST ONLY PROVISIONAL BALLOTS OKAY THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER [inaudible] OPPOSITION. SO I MILES LATER KNICKERBOCKER FROM YELLOW COUNTY HERE TO OPPOSE A. B. SIX NINETY THREE ON BEHALF OF ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. AND I'M JUST GOING TO BRIEFLY REITERATE THE MAIN POINTS. VOTE CALLOUS SHOWN IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH VERIFICATION POINTS MANAGES FORWARD IS TAKING NAME IN OPPOSITION OR THE AUTOS OKAY AS I DO OPPOSE I THINK THAT TO YOU. GIVEN THE FACT THEIR SONS INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION ALL ACTION DAY. OF THESE A. B. NINETY THREE SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTED THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY -- I'VE SEEN NO FURTHER OPPOSITION. I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. GOOD YES MISTER MAYES. OBVIOUSLY OF BELL. INTEGRITY AND WITHIN OUR ELECTION SYSTEM IS -- IS PARAMOUNT FOR THE THE PUBLIC TO HAVE TRUSTS -- THAT BOMB THAT. THEIR VOTE COUNTS I'M IS -- IN AND THAT THOSE WHO SPOKE SHOULDN'T BE ADDED IN IS IS IS. PARAMOUNT TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR DEMOCRACY IS IS SOUND. SO IN REGARDS TO THAT QUESTION OF OF FRAUD -- GET YOU CAN YOU DRESS THAT IS THIS GOING TO TIGHTEN THINGS UP AS A COLUSA MADE THERE THERE'S ABOUT A FEW GOOD POINTS ALTHOUGH I I DO KNOW THAT EVERY TIME I SEE THESE -- THINGS WITH THE YOU SEE SOME IRREGULARITIES THAT HAPPEN THEY'RE VERY THEY'RE THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS WITH OF THE MILLIONS OF VOTERS -- THAT WE DO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA HAVING JUST A FEW OF THESE -- YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE MAKES THAT MAKES THE CASE BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT. THERE COULD BE SOME FRAUD -- THE THAT'S THANK YOU DRESS THAT. SURE -- THE COURT OF THE DAY IT'S GOING TO BE I HAVE A THIRTY FIVE FOOT FLAG POLE IN MY FRONT YARD SO I TAKE THIS EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY I'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. WORKING IN ELECTIONS -- I TEND TO GET CHOKED UP WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS HAVE. I WILL TELL YOU THAT THE PROCESS PROCESSES IN COUNTIES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE STATEWIDE DATABASE THAT THIS BILL PROPOSES ARE THE EXACT SAME PROCESSES. THAT THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF IN OUR OFFICES FOLLOW IN ORDER TO REGISTER AND CONFIRM SOMEONE'S ELIGIBILITY. IF THERE'S A QUESTION IN THE STATEWIDE DATABASE WITHOUT SPEAKING TOO MUCH ELECTION SPEAK IT WILL GIVE YOU A YELLOW LIGHT OR A RED LIGHT. IF THERE IS NO QUESTION IN THE STATEWIDE DATABASE THAT'S THE INFORMATION WE PUT INTO THE SYSTEM ALL MATCHES THE SYSTEM CONFIRMS THE PERSON HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED A BALLOT ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATE. THAT COULD BE COMING BACK AND THAT THE PERSON IS NOT REGISTERED AND VOTING A COUNTY THAT HAS A PAPER ROSTER SO THAT COUNTY IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE STATEWIDE DATABASE -- IN THEIR POLLING PLACES OR VOTE CENTERS OUR SATELLITE OFFICES IT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE GREEN LIGHT THOSE ARE THE EXACT SAME CHECKS WE DO IN OUR OFFICE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS -- ONE QUESTION AT SO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO COMES AND SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION AND AS YOUR PROCESS THEM YOU SEE THAT THERE REGISTERED IN ANOTHER COUNTY -- AND THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN ISSUED AN ABSENTEE BALLOT. WOULD YOU SAY NO YOU CAN'T BOTH THAT DAY. IT WOULD DEPEND. IF WE GET IF I LOOK UP AND I AM IN PLASTER COUNTY. AND SOMEONE HAS JUST MOVED FROM SACRAMENTO THE PLASTER COUNTY AND THEY WERE ISSUED A BILL BY MAIL BALLOT. IN -- SACRAMENTO COUNTY I WOULD DO ONE OF TWO THINGS I WOULD HAVE THEM VOTE A CV ARE BALLOT. HOLD IT TO CONFIRM AFTER ELECTION AY THAT THE PERSON DID NOT RETURN THEIR VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. OR IN THE CASE OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE STATEWIDE DATABASE I COULD ISSUE THE PERSON THE BALLOT HAVE THEM VOTE IN MY OFFICE. INSTANTLY MARK THEM AS VOTED WHICH WOULD VOID THE VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT THEY WERE ISSUED IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO THAT IF IT CAME BACK IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COUNT THE BALLOT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. IT'S THE STATE'S WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY IN THE STATEWIDE DATABASE IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN IF I CALL UP AND I SAY I LOST MY VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT. I NEED A SECOND ONE AND THE COUNTY MALES ME A SECOND ONE IT INSTANTLY VOIGTS THE FIRST ONE ALTHOUGH BY MAIL BALLOTS ON THE VOTE BY MAIL ENVELOPES WHEN THEY COME BACK. OUR BAR CODED WITH A VOTER -- VOTER ISSUE ID SO IT'S ABOUT ID NOT ON THE BALLOT ITSELF BUT ON THE ENVELOPE AND ALL OF OUR SYSTEM SCANDALS BARCODES. AND IF THE FIRST ONE IS VOIDED A WE CAN NEVER OPEN IT THAT'S CURRENT STATE LAW AND BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED PLASTER IN SACRAMENTO AND AND YOU COULD DO THAT BECAUSE SACRAMENTO IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE VOTE COUNT DATABASE. AND SO IT'S ALL ONE DATABASE AND IF YOU MARKET IS VOID THAT SHOWS UP SACRAMENTO ELECTIONS OFFICIALS WILL SEE THAT. INSTANTANEOUSLY IDEA IN TWENTY SECONDS SO THEY GET THAT BALLOT IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THEY'RE JUST GONNA THROW THAT OUT. WELL THAT WE DON'T THROW ANYTHING OUT BUT THEY WON'T OPEN THE ENVELOPE IT WOULD BE VOIDED. WILL BE VOIDED AND THEY WOULD MARK THAT BALLOT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE COUNTED YES SIR THE ENVELOPE THE ENVELOPE WHAT IF THEY WOULDN'T OPEN THEM WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED. WHAT IF YOU'RE A COUNTY THAT'S NOT CONNECTED THAN THEY WOULD BE CV ARE SO THE BALLOT WILL BE PLACED IN A CONDITIONAL PROVISIONAL ENVELOPE? WE WILL WAIT AND TELL AFTER ELECTION DAY. AND THEN WE WOULD PROCESS THOSE ABOUT TO ONLY HAVE A NORMAL FIRMS AS THE SAME PROCESS AS TODAY WE WOULD HAVE TO CONFIRM THAT THE OTHER COUNTY HAS NOT RECEIVED OR COUNTED A BALLOT FROM THAT. OKAY I BECAUSE I I KNOW IT MAY BE THAT SOME CONFUSION TO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THIS WOULD NOW BE ACCOUNTED BUT UNDER THIS BILL IT WILL BECOME ACCOUNTED VOTE. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS. ON IF THE CERTAINTY GETS RID OF DOESN'T YOUR BILL GET RID OF PROVISIONALS FOR IT IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS SO AND AND I'LL DEFERRED TO THE EXPERT ON WITH THOSE SITUATIONS ARE BUT BUT IT IN AND MAYBE I'LL JUST HEAD OVER TO YOU BUT IT IT'S THE IF THESE CERTAIN. SITUATIONS ARE MET AND THEN. A VOTER OR WILL BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NORMAL VOTING PROCESS AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE PROVISIONAL VOTER PROCESS WHICH IS WHICH IS NOT A GREAT. EXPERIENCE FOR VOTERS -- AND SO BUT BUT YOU KNOW AS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE IN THE CERTAIN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES I'M TRYING TO FIND MY NOTES NOW -- HAVE TO BE MET FOR THE AND LOST MY NOTES BUT BUT FOR FOR A VOTER TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THIS PROCESS. THESE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TO BE MET AND IF THERE ANY THERE'S ANY. CONFUSION OR QUESTION THEN THEY'LL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE NORMAL PROVISIONAL VOTER PROCESS WHICH IS THAT PROVISIONAL IS HELD ASIDE. RIGHT. IT'S NOT COUNTED. IS THAT RIGHT IT'S NOT COUNTED INTEL WE CAN GO TO THE VERIFICATION PROCESS AFTER ELECTION DAY AND TELL ME ABOUT WHAT IS THE VERIFICATION PROCESS VERIFICATION PROCESS -- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME GO INTO THE ELECTION SPEAK IS LARGEST IF IT IS AS BRIEFLY AND ASSEMBLY IS VERY. PROCESS IS BASICALLY THE SAME PROCESS THAT A COUNTY WHO WAS CONNECTED TO THE STATEWIDE VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE ON ELECTION DAY WOULD FOLLOW. WE WOULD GO THROUGH CONFIRM THE PERSON AS AN ELIGIBLE REGISTERED VOTER. CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE REGISTERED IN OUR COUNTY. CONFIRM THEY DID NOT RETURN ABOUT IN ANOTHER COUNTY. AND THAT THEY DID NOT APPEAR ON THE ROSTER INDEX AND VOTE IN A COUNTY THAT WAS NOT CONNECTED TO THE STATE BY REGISTRATION DATA. SO THAT'S TOTALLY CONFIRM THAT THEY DIDN'T VOTE SOMEWHERE ELSE RAPIDLY. AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN YOU COUNT THAT PROVISIONAL BALLOT. S. ROOMING THEY VOTED IN THE CORRECT VOTING PRECINCTS WE COUNT THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT IF THEY VOTED IN A PRECINCT THAT MAYBE DID NOT HAVE ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY WERE ENTITLED TO VOTE ON THEY VOTED IN ONE PART OF THE COUNTY AND THEY LIVED IN ANOTHER. WE WOULD DUPLICATE THE RACES THEY'RE ENTITLED TO VOTE ON AND CAL. OKAY. BUT NOW WITH YOUR BILL. IF YOU'RE CONNECTED COUNTY WE'RE JUST GONNA DO ALL THAT AUTOMATICALLY ESSENTIALLY CORRECT. AND WHAT IF. THE WHAT IS IT CALLED CALVERT'S. BOCA VOEPEL. WHAT IF THE DATABASE IS WRONG AND LIKE I THINK ONE OF THE WHAT OPPOSITION IS PLAN AS THEY FOUND INSTANCES WHERE? YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE REGISTERED TO MULTIPLE ADDRESSES YOU KNOW WHERE THERE'S DISPARITIES AND IN THAT SYSTEM ITSELF I THINK WE ALSO HAD THE ISSUE A DMV. REGISTRY IN PEOPLE WHO WERE INELIGIBLE TO VOTE. SO I'M ASSUMING. AT SOME POINT DOES ONE INTO THE SYSTEM OF THOSE BEEN TAKEN OUT THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATABASE ITSELF RARE THERE'S SOME THERE'S A VERIFICATION THAT HAS TO BE DONE I WOULD POINT OUT THAT UNDER THIS BILL. VOEPEL IS THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM WE USE IN OUR OFFICE. SO THERE'S NO ADDED CHECK OR ADDED SYSTEM WE USE IN OUR OFFICE THIS IS THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM THAT I WOULD USE IN MY OFFICE TO CONFIRM SOMEONE'S VOTER ELIGIBILITY. THEY JUST HAVE IT IN THE FALL IN THE VOTE CENTERS OR SATELLITE OFFICES. ARE A BIT ARE YOU AWARE I MEAN FOR TO ME STORIES WHERE THERE ARE ISSUES WITH THE DATABASE ITSELF YES AND WE WE ARE CONNECTED. TO THE STATE WIDE VOEPEL HELP DESK WE GET MESSAGES FROM THEM ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS THEY DO CONFIRMATIONS IN THE DMV INSTANCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED WE'VE GOTTEN LIST OF THOSE VOTERS AND EVEN EITHER COUNSEL THEM ARE CORRECTED THEIR REGISTRATION. OKAY SO I MANAGED FROM YOUR STANDPOINT THERE ARE NO ISSUES WITH THE DATABASE. NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF AS OF TODAY. DOES IT DOES ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP HAVE BEEN THE DISCREPANCIES HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF THE ONES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF YES. HI THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE -- YOU KNOW. FOR ME YOU KNOW I MEAN I THINK THE ISSUE IS WHO REALLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS INTEGRITY HERE I GET WITH TECHNOLOGY WE CAN DO THINGS BUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY THERE'S ALSO ISSUES THAT CAN ARISE AND WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THIS DATABASE ALREADY. SO I THINK LIKE WITHOUT KIND OF SOME MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. AT FEEL OF DIESEL HARD FOR ME TO GET INTO A SUPPORT POSITION ON SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW WOULD. TAKE AWAY WHAT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN DEPTH VERIFICATION PROCESS THAT WE HAVE A PROVISIONAL BALLOTS BUT I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND AND WITHTHE BILL THANK YOU MISS RUSSIA AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. PLEASE PLEASE CLOSE APPRECIATED -- YEAH I I JUST WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE WHAT CHANGE IN THE PROCESS THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE PROCESS THIS DOESN'T CHANGE THE DATABASE REMOTE USING A DIFFERENT DATABASE IN THIS SITUATION AND ANOTHER DATABASE. ON THE BACK AND THIS IS THE SAME PROCESS THAT THAT ELECTIONS OFFICIALS USE. WE USUALLY TWENTY OR TWENTY FIVE DAYS AFTER ELECTION DAY IT'S JUST THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE MODERN TECHNOLOGY FINALLY INTEGRATED IN OUR VOTING SYSTEMS WE CAN DO IT ON THE FRONT END -- WHICH CREATES A MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR THE VOTER BECAUSE VOTERS HAVE FAITH THAT THEIR VOTE IS ACTUALLY BEING COUNTED -- THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRUST AROUND THE PROVISIONAL BALLOT SYSTEM -- BUT SO -- RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

MOVING OUT YOUR NEXT BILL MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU AB. SEVENTEEN OH SEVEN MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME AN INSEPARABLE PART OF OUR DAILY. SKEWS ME TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME AN INSEPARABLE PART OF OUR DAILY LIVES FOR MANY IS A RARE OCCURRENCE TO BE WITHOUT AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE SUCH AS A SMARTPHONE SMARTPHONE OR TABLET. EXISTING AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AT THE FINGERTIPS FOR VOTERS MAKING VOTING EASIER AND ENHANCE VOTER ENGAGEMENT. USING EXISTING TECHNOLOGY RATHER THAN HAVING THE STATE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE MAIL TO OUR RESIDENTS WE CAN SIGN UP FOR A LECTURE ON A DELIVERY. THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS INCORPORATING MORE LINKS TO INCORPORATE TO IT MORE LINKS TO IMPORTANT INFORMATION SO A VOTER AT THEIR POLLING PLACE COULD BRING UP THE GUIDE ON A SMARTPHONE OR TABLET. AND IMMEDIATELY ACCESS THE LIST OF TOP DONORS TO A MEASURE. AS FOR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LOS ANGELES COUNTY WILL SOON BE ROLLING OUT ITS NEW VOTING SYSTEM ONE OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE THE VOTERS WILL BE TO SCAN IN QR CODE IT BALLOTS. FROM THEIR PHONE TO THE VOTING TERMINALS AT POLLING PLACES. UNFORTUNATELY OUR ELECTIONS LAWS DO NOT NECESSARILY CONTEMPLATE THE USE OF SUCH DEVICES. AND SOME ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND POLL WORKERS OF QUESTION THE PERMISSIBILITY OF USING SMARTPHONES OR TABLETS. AT THE POLLS AB SEVENTEEN OH SEVEN WOULD CLARIFY THAT A PERSON MAY NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM USING AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE. AT A POLLING PLACE PROVIDED THAT THE USE OF THE DEVICE DOES NOT VIOLATE OTHER PROVISIONS OF EXISTING LAW. ALL EXISTING VOTER PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE VOTING PROCESSES PRIVATE AND FREE FROM INTIMIDATION ACCORDING NATION WOULD BE MAINTAINED ACCORDINGLY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.
