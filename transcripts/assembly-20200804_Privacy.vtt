THOUSAND NINETEEN WAS THE

00:26:56.681 --> 00:26:57.215
SEVENTY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF

ONE IS THE ISSUE OF DARK

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.042

THINK IT'S DESCRIBED QUITE WELL

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:30.882
IN THE ANALYSIS- THE DARK

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:33.151
PATTERN IS A USER INTERFACE

00:27:33.218 --> 00:27:34.719
DESIGNED OR DELAYED WITH

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:37.389

DARK PATTERN AS IS CONTAINED IN

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.501
THE C. P. R. A. WHICH IS AN

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:50.969
INITIATIVE THAT APPEAR ON THE

00:27:51.036 --> 00:27:53.571

LOS FREEDOM HORRIBLE'S THINGS

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:11.655
THAT COULD HAPPEN. YEAH THERE

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.097
SOME SOME INTERESTING. CASES IN

00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:27.003
THE BILL FOR EXACT. COUNT. IN

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.605
THAT CASE IF THAT WAS OF

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:29.806
CONCERN TO ME AS A CONSUMER I

00:53:29.873 --> 00:53:30.807

THE BE COME TO DO TO CONSUMER

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:20.590
TESTING DO ABIDE BY A CODE OF

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:22.325
ETHICS THAT IS LARGELY EMBODIED

00:54:22.392 --> 00:54:24.928
IN THIS BILL SO I DON'T WANT TO

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:27.530

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:29.532
WHERE THAT'S NOT WHAT TO OUR

00:54:29.599 --> 00:54:33.470
SON OUT LIARS WHO THE AMPLE MAY

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:44.080
OTHERS THE THAT MAY WANT TO USE

00:54:44.147 --> 00:54:47.150
IT TO FOR EXAMPLE IDENTIFY- A

POPULATION HAS A SPECIFIC

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:51.821
GENETIC PREDISPOSITION TO AN

THAT THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

00:54:58.361 --> 00:55:01.297
EFFICACIOUSAND SO THOSE

LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF

GENETIC DATA FOR SCIENTIFIC

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:24.654
RESEARCH BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:27.791
THIS IS A AREA OF RESEARCH AND

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.893
A LOT OF THE HUMAN SCIENTIFIC

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.861
ADVANCEMENTS TO TAKE PLACE

00:55:31.928 --> 00:55:34.964
COUNTRY OVER A CUP OUT OF OUR

00:55:35.031 --> 00:55:38.568
THEY'RE NOT A- PILOT GENETIC

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:39.969
DATA. CAN YOU BROUGH SHOULD THE

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:43.339
BILL TOMORROW HOW A-

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:43.973
INSTITUTION WOULD GO ABOUT GET

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.576
A HOLD OF ANONYMIZE DATA

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.044
WHETHER AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:50.080
WOULD REQUIRE THE CONSENT OF

00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:53.316
ONE THAT WAS PURCHASED. SO THE

00:55:53.383 --> 00:55:54.784
QUESTION W WERE WITH THE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:55.585
RECEIPT CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I

00:55:55.652 --> 00:55:57.420
SHARE YOUR INTEREST AND CONCERN

00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:58.588
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:55:58.655 --> 00:55:59.789
YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THIS

00:55:59.856 --> 00:56:03.626
TIME OF COVERT CRISIS THAT THAT

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:04.294
WE BE ABLE TO. HAVE AS MUCH

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.595
RESEARCH DONE AS POSSIBLE BUT

00:56:05.662 --> 00:56:06.563
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU. PURCHASE AND

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:08.098

MATERIAL USED RESEARCH PURPOSES

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:13.036
WHICH MOST PEOPLE DO. THEN THEN

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:15.405
IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:17.574
IN INDIVIDUAL. IT'S THE- IN

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:20.877
DECEMBER THAT FASHION OKAY. AND

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:23.446
I'M NOT LASTLY I WANT TO FOLLOW

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:25.048
UP ON A SETTLEMENT BERMAN'S

00:56:25.115 --> 00:56:26.983
COMMENTS ABOUT THIS THIS

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.952
DIFFERENT THIS DEFINITION DEBT

00:56:29.018 --> 00:56:30.086
DIFFERENCE IN DEFINITION

00:56:30.153 --> 00:56:32.122
BETWEEN REASONABLY EXPECTED

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.456
INTENDED I SHARE THAT CONCERN

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:34.691
AS WELL I DON'T THINK IT'S

00:56:34.758 --> 00:56:37.160
ANYONE'S IN HERE PUT

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:40.730
LIMITATIONS ON TEST MAYES. WAS

00:56:40.797 --> 00:56:42.832
ABOUT AS IN THE DOOR JUST FOR.

00:56:42.899 --> 00:56:44.801
CHECK OUT BUT IS THE END UP

00:56:44.868 --> 00:56:47.504
WITH US WHAT WE- WHAT IT IS AT

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.472
THE OF THE DISCUSSION. AND I

00:56:49.539 --> 00:56:51.241
HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS

00:56:51.307 --> 00:56:52.675
ISSUE AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.778
THINGS THAT. I THINK IT QUICKLY

00:56:54.844 --> 00:56:56.613
ILLUSTRATE DIFFERENT. AT THAT

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:59.883
WERE BEING AS THE FACT THAT THE

00:56:59.949 --> 00:57:01.351
MORE SOMETHING. YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:02.318
IT ON AN OUTSIDE MIGHT HAVE A

00:57:02.385 --> 00:57:06.656
NEXT. THAT THE TAKE RATE FOR AN

00:57:06.723 --> 00:57:08.458
OFF WOULD BE BRENT FOR

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:12.328
DIFFERENT IF. SUFFEREDYOUR

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:17.000
PAYING A- ONE I BET. OFF TO

00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:18.735
EVERY OUR NOT TO BE IDENTIFIED

00:57:18.802 --> 00:57:20.603
AS BEING DIABETIC BECAUSE OF

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:23.673
THEIR GENETIC DATA BUT- THE

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.941
STATISTICAL DATA SOME ETHIC

00:57:25.008 --> 00:57:27.076
GROUP IS MORE PREVALENT IN-

00:57:27.143 --> 00:57:29.479
CONTRACTING DIABETES AND OTHER

00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:31.881
ETHNIC GROUPS SO I MEAN IF

00:57:31.948 --> 00:57:34.751
YOU'RE REASONABLE QUESTION THAT

00:57:34.818 --> 00:57:37.253
THE TAKE RATE FROM. BUT YOU'RE

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:41.090
NOT. SO I JUST THINK TO BE FAIR

00:57:41.157 --> 00:57:42.258
AND IMPOSE THE SAME RULES ON

00:57:42.325 --> 00:57:43.660
THESE COMPANIES AS EXIST FOR

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:47.864
OTHER COMPANIES AND I THINK

00:57:47.931 --> 00:57:48.464
THAT THAT WORDING CHANGE WOULD

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:51.100
DO THAT SO WHAT THANK YOU FOR.

AND OTHER I'M PROTECTIONS AND

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:14.290
THEY ARE NOT AND SO I THINK

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:17.026
IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE TAKE THIS

00:58:17.093 --> 00:58:20.530
STEP IN PROTECTING THIS WHAT I

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.932

THE STANDARD- RELIES ON THE

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.803
EXPECTED OUTCOME OF ADVERTISING

01:06:13.869 --> 01:06:15.938
RATHER THAN. XIN OF THE EVERY

TIME TO PREVENT INDIRECT-

01:06:18.107 --> 01:06:19.709
DISCRIMINATORY ADVERTISING

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:23.245

YOU KNOW DISPLAY YOU KNOW THIS

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:28.384
IS. SOMEWHAT OF A PROBLEM THAT.

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:33.989
AND THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION

01:06:34.056 --> 01:06:36.192
OF PRIVACY IS REALLY A STANDARD

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:36.726
METRIC USED THROUGHOUT THE

DESPERATE IMPACT WHAT WE CARE

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.969
ABOUT AND LAW IS THE FACT NOT

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:49.672
REALLY THE INTENT. ARM YEAH I

01:06:49.739 --> 01:06:50.806
THINK THE COMMITTEE HAS

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.575
PROPOSED THAT DIRECT TO

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:53.843
CONSUMER GENETIC TESTING

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:55.277
COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

DESPERATE- IMPACT ISN'T

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.452
EXPECTED NOW THIS IS THE LESSER

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.788
STANDARD. THEN OF WHAT THE

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.624
COMMITTEE PROPOSE LAST WEEK-

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.960

APART THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

EARLIER SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:18.968
IS REALLY THE- TWO OF THE

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:24.340
BALLOT IN THE TO BE IN THIS

01:07:24.407 --> 01:07:25.307
