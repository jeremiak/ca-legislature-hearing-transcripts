AS A WOMAN WHO GAVE BIRTH THREE TIMES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH THREE COMPLICATED PREGNANCY I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TAKEN TO BECOME A LEADER IN THE EFFORTS TO LOWER THE RATE AND MATERNAL MORTALITY. OUR STATE COLLABORATIVE. ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE MATERNAL QUALITY CARE COLLABORATIVE IN BRINGING AWARENESS MATERNAL HEALTH.

COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY TO JOIN IN MEMORY OF CAMERA TAMMY THATCHER. A FIREFIGHTER WITH THE SACRAMENTO FIRE DEPARTMENT ASKED WAY ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIX AT THE AGE OF FIFTY ONE AFTER A LONG FIGHT WITH MELANOMA AN OCCUPATIONAL CANCER. FOR THE FAMILY WE PROVIDE A MORE RESOLUTIONS I WANT TO READ ONE PARAGRAPH IN AND THEN PROCEED WITH MY REMARKS. RESOLUTION OPEN SAY WHERE'S WITH IMMENSE SADNESS AND A DEEP SENSE OF LOSS. THE WORD WAS RECEIVED OF THE DEATH ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SIX TWENTY NINETEEN. A FIREFIGHTER TIMBRE THATCHER OF THE CIRCLE FIRE DEPARTMENT. A DISTINGUISHED CALIFORNIA RESIDENT WHOSE CHARACTER AND DEEDS IN LIFE. MERRITT GRATITUDE RESPECTFUL OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

IN HIS TIME WITH RUSH HE WROTE FOR EIGHTEEN OF THE BAND'S STUDIO ALBUMS AND DURING THAT TIME ALSO PUBLISH SEVEN MEMOIRS OF HIS TRAVELS. THE LYRICS NOVELS WERE BUYS DEEP LOVE OF LITERATURE HISTORY AND POLITICS IN HIS WORDS ENCOURAGE FANS TO FIND THEIR INDIVIDUALITY. AND EXPRESSED A VULNERABILITY THAT THEY CAN RELATE TO.
