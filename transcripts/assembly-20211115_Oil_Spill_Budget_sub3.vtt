REGARDING THESE ISSUES AND EACH

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.103
TIME WE HAVE MADE IMPROVEMENTS

00:21:11.169 --> 00:21:13.338
TO SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.874
HOWEVER OIL ALWAYS FINDS NEW

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:18.043
WAYS TO GET INTO THE ENVIRONMENT

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.312
TO THE POINT THAT'S BILL SEEM AN

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:22.547
AB INEVITABLE. IN THIS CASE WE

00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:24.516
HAVE A MARINE SPILL ORIGINATING

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:26.284
IN FEDERAL WATERS WERE A

00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:27.853
PIPELINE SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.588
DISPLACEMENT WHICH WAS

00:21:29.655 --> 00:21:31.590
APPARENTLY UNDETECTED WHERE THIS

00:21:31.657 --> 00:21:32.891
BILL WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.526
DETECTED AND REPORTED AND WHERE

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.194
THE RESPONSE WAS DELAYED. BY

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:38.997
LAGS IN REPORTING AND DARKNESS.

00:21:39.064 --> 00:21:41.667
AS BAD AS THIS BILL HAS BEEN FOR

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:43.568
THIS COMMUNITY WE GOT VERY

00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:45.637
LUCKY. IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:47.406
WORSE THE COMMUNITY AND MANY

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:48.940
OTHER COASTAL AND INLAND

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:50.776
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:53.011
REMAIN AT RISK DUE TO THE

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.846
INHERENT RISKS OF OIL PRODUCTION

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:56.815

POLLUTION CONTROLS AND AN

00:22:01.319 --> 00:22:03.522
ADEQUATE MAINTENANCE. AND THE

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:06.224
FACT IS THAT THESE RISKS PALE IN

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:08.627
COMPARISON TO THE DAILY HEALTH

00:22:08.694 --> 00:22:11.063
IMPACTS OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTION.

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:13.465
REFINING AND USE EVEN IF

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:15.867
ACCIDENTS ARE ELIMINATED USING

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:18.236
OIL AS INTENDED UNFORTUNATELY

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:20.639
KILLS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. AND

00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:21.373
LOW INCOME AND MINORITY

PLUME OF OIL ABOUT A HUNDRED

00:37:20.037 --> 00:37:22.540
YARDS IN DIAMETER. AND WHEN IT

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:23.274
WHEN WE WERE OUT THERE

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.542
COLLECTING SAMPLES ARE SHOULD

SAY THE COAST GUARD WAS

00:37:42.226 --> 00:37:44.829
SCHOOL AT THAT TIME. AND SO WE

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:48.299
ASKED A- HELICOPTER ONE OF OUR

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.801

TRANSPARENCY M. THERE HAS BEEN

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.769
SINCE THAT DAY IN CONTINUES

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:16.040
TODAY DALY REPORTED HIMSELF.

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:18.442
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE ACTIONS

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.845
OF OUR FOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.985
JOB AND THEY DID IT WELL SO

00:41:28.052 --> 00:41:32.923
THANK YOU. THERE ARE TWO

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.292
STANDARDS THAT I THINK YOU HAVE

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:38.796
THE TOOLS TO USE IN THE- THEIR

00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:39.997
STANDARDS CONTAINED IN THE

00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.600
CALIFORNIA'S NINETEEN NINETY US

00:41:42.666 --> 00:41:47.304
FOR- STATUTES THE OIL. SPILL

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:50.708
RESPONSE AND RESTORATION ACT ONE

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:53.444
STANDARD IS BEST ACHIEVABLE

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.280
PROTECTIONS WE USE THAT TODAY IN

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.215
WATER QUALITY WE JUST CALL IT

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:00.751
BEST AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY BUT-

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:03.053
IT DOES EXIST AND IT SAYS THAT

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:03.888
THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:06.557
WILDLIFE. WILL HOLD OIL

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.692
COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE

00:42:08.759 --> 00:42:10.928
SURE THAT AS TECHNOLOGY AS A

00:42:10.995 --> 00:42:13.831
MESSAGE AS SENSORS AS

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:17.234
REQUIREMENT- INVOLVES THAT THE

00:42:17.301 --> 00:42:18.903
OIL COMPANIES WILL IMPLEMENT

00:42:18.969 --> 00:42:22.473
THAT. M. AFTER THIRTY ONE YEARS

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:24.108
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SHE AN

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:28.345
EVALUATION- OF ACTUALLY WHAT HAS

00:42:28.412 --> 00:42:30.748
BEEN CHANGED BECAUSE WHEN YOU

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:32.883
SEE BLOOMS AND DISPERSANTS

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:35.719
THAT'S OLD TECHNOLOGY. AND SELF

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:40.291
YEAH I THINK I THINK THAT'S A. A

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:41.625
STARTING PLACE- THE THING IS FOR

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.627
MEDICATION WE FIND IN MOST

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:46.931
REGULAR RATE REGULATIONS THAT

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.999
ARE THERE'S ALWAYS AN ECONOMIC

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:51.335
BALANCING WHAT WHAT CAN YOU DO

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:53.337
GOOD WHAT CAN YOU DO TO MITIGATE

00:42:53.404 --> 00:42:55.906
AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLE COST

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:59.543
EFFECTIVE. SPECIFICALLY FOR

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.378
MEDICATION IN THE OSCAR ACT. DID

00:43:01.445 --> 00:43:04.315
IT UP DOES NOT- IN AND IT

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:06.450
SPECIFICALLY STATES ECONOMICS

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.819
WILL NOT BE A FACTOR. THAT

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:11.889
MITIGATION MUST BE DONE

00:43:11.956 --> 00:43:14.391
REGARDLESS OF THE COST AND IF

00:43:14.458 --> 00:43:15.592
THE OPERATOR DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:18.329
MONEY THEN. THE OIL INDUSTRY

00:43:18.395 --> 00:43:21.732
SHOULD CHIP IN AND SO THOSE ARE

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:24.868
TWO VERY OF THE INCREDIBLE OF

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.870
STANDARDS THAT WERE NEGOTIATED

00:43:26.937 --> 00:43:29.440
WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY BY. THE

00:43:29.506 --> 00:43:32.042
MEMBERS OF THE TABLE IN NINETEEN

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:33.444
NINETY M. I WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.980
THAT THAT THE ROBUST NOW AS THEY

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:39.883
WERE. INTENDED TO BE IN NINETEEN

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.986
NINETY. IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S

00:43:42.052 --> 00:43:46.523
BEEN SIX MAJOR OIL SPILLS SINCE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.692
NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. M. I

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:51.528
GUARANTEE TO FIX I GUARANTEE

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:56.400
THERE WILL BE MORE OIL SPILLS. I

00:43:56.467 --> 00:43:58.736
ALSO GUARANTEE THAT. THE

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:01.405
PLATFORM OPERATOR RESPONSIBLE

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:03.507
FOR THE OIL SPILL YOU'LL

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:05.242
PROBABLY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF.

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.344
THE POINT BEING THAT LARGE

00:44:07.411 --> 00:44:10.547
COMPANIES ARE GONE. SHELL EXXON

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:13.083
UNION ARE CO AND CHEVRON WHO

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.319
BUILT THESE ARE GONE THERE'S

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:17.721
MAYBE SOME UNDERLYING LEASES BUT

00:44:17.788 --> 00:44:18.589
ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE NOT

00:44:18.655 --> 00:44:21.692
OPERATING IN YOU HAVE MORE FAR

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:23.460
MORE MARGINAL COMPANIES

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:28.832
OPERATING IN YET YOU KNOW THE-

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:31.068
THE IMPACTS OF AN OIL SPILL ARE

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:34.104
SO GREAT. I JUST WONDER IF WE

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:36.540
COULD DO SOMETHING BETTER. IF

00:44:36.607 --> 00:44:38.342
THE REMAINING TWENTY SEVEN

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.676
PLATFORMS ARE GOING TO START

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:42.246
DECOMMISSIONING A CLEAR PATH TO

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.281
EXPEDITE DECOMMISSIONING MUST BE

00:44:44.348 --> 00:44:47.718
DEVELOPED. CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:48.986
THREE PLATFORMS OPERATING

00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:51.922
PLATFORMS PLUS HOLLY WHICH WAS

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.892
ABANDONED BY RANOCO. TWENTY

THREE YEAR IN FEDERAL WATERS WE

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:59.863

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:30.594
ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER SIGNED AND

00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:32.596
IT HAS NEVER BEEN IMPLEMENTED

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:34.231
REGULATIONS WERE NEVER PUT

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:35.799
TOGETHER BECAUSE THERE'S TIME

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.835
FRAMES IN THE LEGISLATION THAT

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:39.570
MAKE IT INFEASIBLE THE

00:45:39.636 --> 00:45:41.538
COMMISSION WITHOUT WOULD GO BACK

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:43.540
INTO FIX THAT LEGISLATION BUT

00:45:43.607 --> 00:45:45.776
THAT WAS NEVER DONE AND I THINK

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.711
OF SERIOUS WORK WOULD BE TO TAKE

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:50.280
A LOOK AT THE STATUTE AB TWENTY

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:52.416
FIVE OH THREE- JUST VERY

00:45:52.483 --> 00:45:55.052
EXTREMELY BRIEFLY. IT REQUIRES A

00:45:55.119 --> 00:45:57.855
AB ROBUST BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT

00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:00.023
OF EACH ROOF TO DETERMINE IF

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.992
THEY IN FACT ARE PRODUCING

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:05.762
PRODUCTIVE HABITATS IN WEEKS- IF

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:08.465
SHOW THEIR THE PROPOSAL IS TO

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:09.600
CUT HIM OFF AT EIGHTY FEET BELOW

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:12.202
THE SURFACE CALCULATE THE COST

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:14.872
SAVINGS THE OIL COMPANY SAVES BY

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:17.074
NOT REMOVING THEM. AND THEY

00:46:17.141 --> 00:46:18.375
BASICALLY WRITE A CHECK TO THE

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.478
STATE OF CALIFORNIA 465285% OF

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:26.483
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WILL.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.551
GO TO COASTAL RESTORATION. THE

00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:29.086
STRUCTURE BELONGS TO PROPERTY OF

00:46:29.153 --> 00:46:30.754
THE STATE IN THE OIL COMPANIES

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:34.224
PERPETUALLY HAVE RESPONSIBILITY

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.395
FOR WELL HAD SAFETY. SO THE

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:41.932
POINT IS THIS THE EXIST THE THIS

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:44.902
TOOL IN THIS CONVERSATION AND

00:46:44.968 --> 00:46:46.904
I'M SO DELIGHTED WERE HAVING IT

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.205
TODAY AND AGAIN I THANK ALL OF

00:46:48.272 --> 00:46:50.807
YOU- THIS CONVERSATION WENT

00:46:50.874 --> 00:46:54.011
DORMANT ON THE SHELF SINCE TWO

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:54.578
THOUSAND TWELVE THERE HASN'T

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:56.446
BEEN ANY DISCUSSION. AND IF

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:58.849
THERE'S ANYTHING POSITIVE OUT OF

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.951
THIS OIL SPILL IT'S POSSIBLY TO

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:04.688
REIGNITE THIS CONVERSATION AND

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:06.924
TO REPLY BUT WE ALL KNOW WE ALL

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.759
SIT HERE AND WE ALL REALIZE

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:11.962
THESE OIL PLATFORMS NEED TO. BE

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.531
DECOMMISSIONED AND COME OUT M. I

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:15.699
WOULD JUST TELL YOU FROM MY

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:19.169
EXPERIENCE AND IN DOING THAT THE

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:20.771
BILL THAT WE HAD. IT WASN'T A

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:23.373
FIGHT. IT WASN'T TO BATTLE THE

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.376
OIL COMPANIES WANT A CLEAR PATH

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.345
TO COMPLIANCE THEY'RE OPERATING

00:47:28.412 --> 00:47:31.348
AT A MANY CASES AT A LOSS BUT

00:47:31.415 --> 00:47:33.116
IT'S CHEAPER TO OPERATE AT A

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:36.053
LOSS THAN IT IS TO FACE.

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.921
MILLIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING.

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:40.257
THEY'RE LOOKING AND WAITING FOR

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:42.359
A CLEAR PATH THAN WE HAVE NOW

00:47:42.426 --> 00:47:44.595
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE I WOULD

00:47:44.661 --> 00:47:46.763
GIVE YOU THE LEGISLATORS- AND

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.865
YOU CAN DO IT AND SO. I THINK

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:50.634
THIS IS A SOLVABLE THING I THINK

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.236
THEY'RE STAKEHOLDERS WILLING TO

00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:54.137
COME TO THE TABLE AND SO WE LOOK

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:55.272
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

00:47:55.339 --> 00:47:56.406

WERE NOTIFIED ABOUT THE OIL

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.809
SPILLS SO ON SATURDAY OCTOBER

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:36.346
SECOND WE- WE RECEIVED A

00:53:36.413 --> 00:53:39.115
MESSAGE. THAT THE COAST GUARD

00:53:39.182 --> 00:53:40.750
HAD PUT OUT A MESSAGE SAYING

00:53:40.817 --> 00:53:42.319
THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL OIL

SPILL OFF THE SHORE OF COAST OF

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.289
HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SO WE

00:53:46.356 --> 00:53:48.491
REALLY DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.460
DRAMATIC AT THAT TIME IT WAS

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:51.595
SOMETHING TO JUST PUT ON THE

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:54.030
RADAR AND SO WE WERE MONITORING

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.733

YOU PROBABLY KNOW WE WERE IN THE

00:53:58.668 --> 00:54:01.504
MIDST OF OUR PACIFIC AIR SHOW

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:04.341
AND THAT DAY WE HAD ONE POINT

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:06.309
FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

00:54:06.376 --> 00:54:08.411
AND HUNTINGTON BEACH TO ENJOY.

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.847
THE PACIFIC CARE SHOW SO WE WERE

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.916
MONITORING THIS OIL SPILL BUT

00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:14.551
REALLY THE FOCUS WAS ON THE AIR

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:16.553
SHOW HROUGHOUT THE DAY WE

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:18.254
STARTED TO GET MORE MESSAGING

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.123

00:54:20.190 --> 00:54:21.658

00:54:23.927 --> 00:54:25.795
ABOUT IT SO AS THE DAY

00:54:25.862 --> 00:54:27.530
PROGRESSED THE COAST GUARD HAD

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:31.167
TOLD US- THAT THIS OIL SPILL WAS

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:33.536
SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER IT WOULD NOT

00:54:33.603 --> 00:54:35.672
BE REACHING OUR SHORE UNTIL

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:38.675

THIS AND AS WE STARTED TO GET

00:54:47.617 --> 00:54:50.253
THE AIR SHOW WE STARTED TO

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:50.820

HITTING OUR SHORES THAT EVENING.

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.463

OIL SPILL RESPONSE PROGRAM- AND

00:55:11.241 --> 00:55:14.044
WE HAVE ACTUALLY A- FULL. A

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:15.979
GIANT BINDER ON WHAT TO DO WHEN

00:55:16.046 --> 00:55:18.782
THERE'S AN OIL SPILL. AND WE

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:21.451
DECIDED THAT MOMENT AT AROUND

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:22.552
TWO O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON

00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:24.454
THAT IF THE OIL DID START TO

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.356
APPROACH THE SHORES. WE WOULD

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:31.227
ENACT THAT PROCEDURE- ROUND FOUR

00:55:31.294 --> 00:55:33.396
THIRTY THAT AFTERNOON. WE WERE

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:35.632
TOLD AGAIN THE OIL WOULD NOT BE

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:37.267

HUNDRED YARDS OFF YOUR COAST

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:47.577

BOOM AROUND OUR MOST

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:55.652
ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AREAS.

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.187
LIKE THE TALBERT MARSH LIKE THE

AND WE BY BY DOING THIS WE

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.565
REALLY FEEL AS THOUGH WE

00:56:08.631 --> 00:56:12.168

OIL SPILL- AND THEN. ALSO I JUST

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.954
WANT TO SAY THERE WAS A BIT OF

00:59:18.021 --> 00:59:20.823
A- REPUTATION DAMAGETHAT WE'RE

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.625

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:27.163
INTERNATIONAL EVENT AND SO

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.698
PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE THINKING

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.300
ABOUT WHERE TO PUT THEIR-

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:32.368

CONVENTION. THEY TOOK A PAUSE

00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:37.407
WHEN THINKING ABOUT GOING TO

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.575
ORANGE COUNTY OVERALL BECAUSE OF

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:42.345
THE OIL SPILL- I'M GRATEFUL

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:44.714
THOUGH TO SAY THAT WE- ARE

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.649
BLESSED WITH BEAUTIFUL WEATHER.

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.518
BEAUTIFUL BEACHES NEVER THE LESS

00:59:48.584 --> 00:59:50.787
AND SO WE WILL RECOVER AND WE

00:59:50.853 --> 00:59:53.289
WILL BE MORE RESILIENT AND

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:55.491
STRONGER THAN EVER. BUT AS YOU

00:59:55.558 --> 00:59:56.960
KNOW OUR DIRECTOR BOTTOM SAID

00:59:57.026 --> 00:59:58.628
THERE IS NO SUCH GOOD THING AS

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.830
AN OIL SPILL WE CONTINUE TO

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:01.664
LEARN WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:04.434
BETTER- AND I WOULD US IF THE

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:05.635
STATE LEGISLATORS WHEN YOU'RE

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.604
LOOKING AT- OPPORTUNITIES TO GET

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.307
BETTER. WE REALLY FEEL THAT THE

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:14.410
RESPONSE THAT WE RECEIVED IS SO

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:15.611
IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:18.247
TALKING ABOUT DAYS IT REALLY IS

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:20.383
MINUTES IT'S HOURS THAT MAKE A

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.652
HUGE DIFFERENCE- YOU KNOW I LIKE

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:23.953
TO THINK THAT IF WE WOULD HAVE

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:24.954
HAD MAYBE A COUPLE OF MORE

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.889
HOURS. WE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.691
SOME OF THE DAMAGE THAT HAPPENED

01:00:28.758 --> 01:00:30.326
AT TALBERT MARCH THAT WE ARE

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:31.694
STILL DEALING WITH THE CLEAN UP.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:32.595
I'M IF WE COULD HAVE HAD A

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:33.963
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME MAYBE WE

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.231
COULD HAVE PREVENTED SOME OF

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.900
THAT OIL FROM. SEEPING INTO THAT

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.169
ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREA BUT

01:00:40.236 --> 01:00:42.472
NEVER THE LESS I AS I SAID I

01:00:42.538 --> 01:00:44.674
DON'T WANT TO- SAY ANYTHING

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.808
REALLY NEGATIVE ABOUT THE COAST

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:46.743
GUARD BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:00:46.809 --> 01:00:48.711
FABULOUS- IT WAS JUST THAT

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:52.348
INITIAL. PERIOD WHERE THERE WAS

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.282
A LOT OF CONFUSION A LOT OF CAN

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:55.018
SIXTEEN AND FOR- IF THERE WAS

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.152
ONE THING THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.887
HAD SOME TIME TO. KIND OF LOOK

01:00:57.954 --> 01:00:59.255
BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHT COULD

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:01.357
WE HAVE DONE BETTER. AND TALKING

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:03.559
TO MY- FIRE CHIEF IN MY POLICE

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:06.295
CHIEF. WHAT WE CONSISTENTLY HERE

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.764
IS IF THE COAST GUARD COULD HAVE

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.266
NOTIFIED US IMMEDIATELY. RATHER

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.701
THAN THE PROCESS THAT THEY GO

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.302
THROUGH RIGHT NOW WHICH IS GOING

01:01:13.369 --> 01:01:14.270
THROUGH A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.439
AGENCIES BEFORE. IT ACTUALLY

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.975
HITS THE AGENCY MOST AFFECTED BY

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.543
WHICH IS THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:21.878
BEACH MAYBE IF THAT COULD BE

01:01:21.944 --> 01:01:23.980
MORE STREAMLINED AND SO THERE

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:26.349

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.517
DEPARTMENT DOES THIS THIS

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:29.452
DEPARTMENT DOES THAT AND THEN

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.654
ALSO- WE WERE BLESSED AND THAT

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:33.122

HAVE HAD THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.498
NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS OIL

01:01:42.565 --> 01:01:44.534
SPILL HAD WE NOT HAD A BOAT THAT

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.436
SANK. THE YEAR BEFORE AND

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.571
HUNTINGTON HARBOUR AND THAT

01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:50.373

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.808
SPILL IN HUNTINGTON HARBOUR IN

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.776
TWENTY TWENTY. SO OUR FIRE CHIEF

INVOLVED IN THIS BUT REALLY LET

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.524
ME TURN TO THE HEART OF IT. WE

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.693
CAN GET BETTER WE HAVE TO GET

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.863
BETTER THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:09.999
COMING TO AN OVERSIGHT HEARING.

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.467
THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF A

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:12.701
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN THE

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:15.204
LEGISLATURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:18.107
WE HAVE TO ADAPT. RESILIENCY IS

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.975
THE MEASURE OF LEARNING FROM

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.977
YOUR LESSONS. THIS HAPPENED

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.647
AFTER COSCO BUSAN IT HAPPENED

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.281
AFTER THE SANTA BARBARA SPILL

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:30.152
REFUGIO CALIFORNIA STRONG WE CAN

01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:33.155
GET BETTER. SO HERE ARE SOME OF

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:35.791
THE THINGS I AM PERSONALLY

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:39.995
THINKING ABOUT AS AREAS OF. SO

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:41.530
THE FIRST EXAMPLE I THINK WE

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:43.699
NEED TO EXPLORE CAPACITY AT A

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:46.602
LOCAL LEVEL SO MAYOR CARNAGE

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:48.837
AND- BLOOD FOR THEM HAVING

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:51.106
SUBMITTED A GRANT AND RECEIVED A

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:53.509
QUICK MANNER THE RESPONSE AT

01:11:53.575 --> 01:11:54.543
TALBERT MARSH MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.912
MORE INJURED. THAT ACTUALLY IS A

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.647
GRANT PROGRAM I THINK OUR

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:01.283
DEPARTMENT RUNS TO US BURKE WE

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.386
NEED TO THINK ABOUT BEING ABLE

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:07.389
TO PROVIDE THAT LOCAL RESPONSE

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.092
EQUIPMENT ABILITY BLOOM MOBILE

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.162
UNITS UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND

01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:14.596
THE HUNTINGTON BEACH EXAMPLE OF

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:17.833
HOW THEY- FEEL GO FOR WAITED. ON

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.069
SATURDAY BY DEPLOYING AT TALBERT

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:22.905
MARSH IS A CASE STUDY WHY WE

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:25.407
NEED TO THINK ABOUT CAPACITY OUR

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.476
CURRENT PROGRAM I THINK WAS IT

01:12:27.543 --> 01:12:29.445
IS WITH ABOUT SIX PORTS. BUT

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.146
MAYBE WE NEED TO CONSIDER AT A

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.882
COUNTY LEVEL. A SECOND AREA OF

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.984
IMPROVEMENT AND MY MIND IS WE

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:37.653
NEED TO GO LOOK AT WHAT A CALL

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.756
BACK CONTINGENCY PLANS- THE

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:44.026
DOCUMENTS THAT THREE IDENTIFY

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.195
ALL THE SENSITIVE AREAS AND THE

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:51.934
STRATEGY. YES THIS BILL WHAT

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.501
HAPPENS. WHY OF THE THINGS

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.369
THAT'S US DOWN IN THE EARLY IS

01:12:54.436 --> 01:12:57.005
WE SPENT A LOT OF THE SITE.

01:12:57.072 --> 01:12:58.941
TRYING TO FIND THE NEXT PLACE

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.476
FOR THE INCIDENT COMMAND POST.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:02.711
WE NEED GET BEYOND. AND

01:13:02.778 --> 01:13:04.146
BASICALLY HAVE DONE OUR REAL

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.315
ESTATE DUE TO DILIGENCE BEFORE A

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:08.984
SPILL SO WE KNOW APPROPRIATE

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:11.153
PUBLIC VENUES WE CAN HOST THE

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.057
COMMAND. THAT ARE NOT FACILITIES

01:13:15.124 --> 01:13:17.159
OWNED BY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY I

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.928
THINK A RESPONSIBLE PARTY VENUE

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:22.564
CREATES CONFUSION IN THE PUBLIC.

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.466
AND UNDERCUTS TRUST. OTHER

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.602
EXAMPLES OF IMPROVEMENTS WE HAVE

01:13:26.668 --> 01:13:29.138
THE WORLD'S BEST OILED WILDLIFE

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.473
CARE NETWORK AVAILABLE TO

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.475
RESPOND TO SPILLS. THAT IS A

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.677
REASON WHY WE GOT A SUCCESS IN

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.946
THIS BILL WE ACTIVATED THAT

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:39.982
NETWORK PROMPTLY IT ACTUALLY HAD

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.217
DISABILITIES AND EXPERTS IN THE

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:45.187
AREA. NEARBY WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.256
OUT A WAY TO REPLICATE SOME

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:49.491
SIMILAR NETWORK. FOR OUR

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.493
CONSERVATION ENVIRONMENTAL NON

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.529
PROFITS UP AND DOWN THE COAST

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.598
SOME WAY TO PRE TRAIN REGULARLY

01:13:56.665 --> 01:13:58.834
COMMUNICATE WITH AND STAYING

01:13:58.901 --> 01:14:01.203
CLOSE CONTACT WITH OUR AFFILIATE

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.105
VOLUNTEERS SO WE'RE NOT DOING IT

01:14:03.172 --> 01:14:04.373
IN THE CHAOTIC BEGINNING

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:07.009
MOMENTS. BUT THAT RESOURCES MORE

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:10.379
READILY AVAILABLE MORE READILY

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:11.647
DEPLOYABLE. WE TO IMPROVE IN

01:14:11.713 --> 01:14:13.782
TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. YOU HEARD

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.919
FROM MISTER BROWN THAT. WE USE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.154
OLD TECHNOLOGY I WOULD SUBMIT IN

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:21.690
RESPONSE BLAME WHETHER OLDER

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.092
NEWS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IT'S WHAT

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.895
HELPS DEAL WITH ALBERT MARSH. WE

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.964
DID NOT USE THIS PERSON COMES

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:30.933
HELLO WE DON'T USE THEM IN

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:33.368
CALIFORNIA THERE'S A LOT OF

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:34.469
REGULATION AROUND IT. BUT WHAT

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.605
WE HAVEN'T DONE YET IS CRACKED

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:39.174
THE TECHNOLOGY NOT ON MY TALK.

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:40.475
AS THE SHERIFF MENTIONED

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:41.977
PREVIOUSLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:45.747
NIGHT IT'S NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:48.884
FIGURE OUT A DARK SHEEN IN THE

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.587
DARK OF NIGHT ON A DARK OCEAN

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.789
SURFACE BUT I GOTTA THINK. WITH

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:55.691
CALIFORNIA BEING A TECHNOLOGY

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.359
LEADER THERE MIGHT BE SOME

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.927
IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT SPACE

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:02.531
CURRENT LAW REQUIRES US PER TO

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:05.767
DO IT TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP EVERY

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.337
TWO YEARS. IF WE FOLLOWED

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:11.006
CURRENT TIMELINE WE WOULD DO A

01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:14.109
WORKSHOP I THINK IN TWENTY

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:14.643
TWENTY THREE WE NEED TO DO

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:17.079
WANTED TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND USE

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:19.915
THIS BILL AS THE FOCAL POINT FOR

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.750
THE TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP WITH A

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:24.720
SPECIFIC FOCUS ON KIND OF NIGHT

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:28.490
TIME. TECHNOLOGY IN MY OPINION.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:29.324
WE'RE IMPROVING IN THE MIDDLE

01:15:29.391 --> 01:15:32.461
THIS BILL SIR. WAS ARE.

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:35.430
IDENTIFIED NONPROFIT LIAISE ALL

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:37.466
THROUGH THIS BILL THE FIRST TIME

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:38.400
WE'VE EVER DONE SOMETHING LIKE

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:41.303
THAT. ON THEIR OWN THEY CAME UP

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.639
WITH A TARBALL APPLICATION

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.574
PEOPLE COULD USE ON THEIR PHONES

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.276
AND WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THAT IN

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:50.579
THE MIDDLE OF THIS BILL HAS BEEN

01:15:50.646 --> 01:15:52.381
INCREDIBLY USEFUL ON OUR- LAST

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:54.549
AREA OF IMPROVEMENT I THINK THAT

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.652
I'M THINKING ABOUT. FISHERIES

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:59.187
CLOSURES AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:02.257
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND- FORTY

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.026
FIVE SQUARE MILES STILL CLOSE

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:05.360
FOR COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.796
FISHING. I DON'T THINK WE CAN

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.464
SOLVE THE FISHERIES CALLING HER

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.867
DYNAMIC AND SPILLS BY BUILDING

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.802
ANOTHER LABORATORY SOMEWHERE.

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:15.137
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS IT

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:17.172
TAKES ABOUT FOURTEEN DAYS TO THE

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:19.374
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF SAMPLES

01:16:19.441 --> 01:16:21.843

MUCH ABOUT THE MOVEMENT AND THE

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.155
CAUSALITY UNDERSTAND THAT'S

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:29.257
UNDER INVESTIGATION. BUT WHY

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:31.226
WERE THERE NO SENSORS THAT

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:35.964
INDICATED THAT THERE WAS SMOKE.

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:41.469
I CAN- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. A LOT OF

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:46.074
SENSORS OR ARE. NOT SUFFICIENT

MONITORING RELATIVE TO THE

01:25:47.742 --> 01:25:49.477
PIPELINE OR QUESTIONS BETTER

FEDERAL JURISDICTION IN FEDERAL

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:04.959
WATERS. PIPELINE I KNOW THAT'S A

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:06.995
FRUSTRATING RESPONSE FROM US.

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:09.264
BUT FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND ALSO

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:12.100

01:26:12.166 --> 01:26:14.536
TRIP PRACTICING FOR RESPONSE AND

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:16.137

TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE TODAY- THAT

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.731
WOULD ALLOW BETTER RESPONSE IN

01:26:43.798 --> 01:26:51.239
THE DARK. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:52.807
BUT I CONFESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:55.710
I'M NOT THAT BEST TECHNOLOGY

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:59.347
EXPERT I AM. REPORTER THE MAIN

01:26:59.414 --> 01:27:01.249
KIND OF THE LACK OF RADAR IN

01:27:01.316 --> 01:27:03.017
THIS SPACE IT WAS A CONVERSATION

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:05.286
IN THIS SENATE OVERSIGHT

01:27:05.353 --> 01:27:07.488
COMMITTEE. THIS IS WHY I

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:09.023
RECOMMENDED I THINK THE

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.992
ADMINISTRATOR ALWAYS SPORTS WE

01:27:11.059 --> 01:27:13.728
DO. THE REQUIRED TECHNOLOGY

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.630
WORKSHOP A YEAR SOONER THAN WE

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.932
WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE AND WE MAKE

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.801
THIS NIGHT TIME ISSUE A SPECIFIC

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:22.403
FOCUS AND I WOULD TAKE IT A STEP

01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:24.539
FURTHER. ONE OF THE AREAS OF

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:26.374
IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONING ALSO

01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:28.610
COMING OUT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:31.613
A CONVENING WITH OUR EXPERTS IN

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:34.449
OUR UNIVERSITY SPACE. SO WE HAVE

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:36.517
A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WHO ARE

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:39.187
EXPERTS USE UC SANTA BARBARA

01:27:39.253 --> 01:27:42.657
SCRIPTS INSTITUTE UC SAN DIEGO.

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.626
I HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN

01:27:44.692 --> 01:27:47.862
WRAPPING AND OTHER IMAGERY

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.430
TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK WE OUGHT

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:52.200
TO GO TO SOLICIT THEIR FEEDBACK

01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:54.102
AS WELL NOT JUST INDUSTRIES.

01:27:54.168 --> 01:27:55.336
THAT RAISES AN INTERESTING

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:59.007
QUESTION- WE AT LAST YEAR FUNDED

01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:02.977
A- A WILDFIRE RESPONSE INSTITUTE

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:04.912
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:28:04.979 --> 01:28:07.382
DO WE HAVE- ANY KIND OF FORMAL

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:10.551
COORDINATED EFFORT AMONGST- ANY

01:28:10.618 --> 01:28:14.422
OF OUR- A PUBLIC- AT A HIGHER

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:18.259
READ SEGMENTS ON THE ISSUE OF

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:21.329
OIL SPILLS. YES AND A VARIETY OF

01:28:21.396 --> 01:28:24.065
WAYS BUT PROBABLY NOT ONE AND

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:27.402
SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON LIKE

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:29.871
SOME OF THIS TECHNOLOGY RADAR.

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:32.340
WITH OUR UNIVERSITIES WE- HAVE

01:28:32.407 --> 01:28:33.841
TECHNICAL WORKING GROUPS UP AND

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:36.644
DOWN THE STATE- MISTER BROWN B.

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:39.380
EARLIER WITNESS MENTIONED HIS

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.982
PARTICIPATION IN THE LA LONG

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:43.284
BEACH FOR OSCAR TECHNICAL

01:28:43.351 --> 01:28:46.621
ADVISORY COMMITTEE. WE ALSO HAVE

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:48.756
IS YOU KNOW A FORMAL FONG

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.957
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OLD

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:52.860
WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK- FROM THE

01:28:52.927 --> 01:28:54.829
WILDLIFE RESPONSE SPACE. I THINK

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:56.330
WE NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:58.533
EXISTING MODELS AND ASK AND

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:00.034
ANSWER WHETHER WE SHOULD

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:02.170
REPLICATE SOMETHING SIMILAR. IN

01:29:02.236 --> 01:29:03.705
THE NONPROFIT WORLD IN THE

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:06.507
UNIVERSITY WORLD. AND WHETHER

01:29:06.574 --> 01:29:09.310
THOSE TO NOON- KIND OF MODELS

01:29:09.377 --> 01:29:09.844
COULD HELP US TO BETTER IN

01:29:09.911 --> 01:29:13.347
SCHOOLS. THANK YOU AND HAVE A

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:15.383
DIRECTOR BOTH YOU AND- MAYOR

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:22.356
KERR. SPOKE ABOUT THE. OIL SPILL

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:24.759
RESPONSE PLANS AND- AFTER AT THE

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.195
LOCAL LEVEL CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:30.865
AND I- TOOK ADVANTAGE OF FOR A

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:33.301
NOT DURING THIS MEETING TO SEND

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:35.670
A TEXT TO SOMEBODY I KNOW- BACK

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:38.906
FROM- MY MAYORAL DAYS- IN IN

01:29:38.973 --> 01:29:39.574
SANTA MONICA AND THE FIRE

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.576
DEPARTMENT- TO SEE IF SANTA

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:44.112
MONICA HAS AN ORAL RESPONSE PLAN

01:29:44.178 --> 01:29:46.514
THAT IT BEING A- COASTAL CITY

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:49.984
AND THE ANSWER IS NO- SO- I

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:53.354
THINK IT WOULD BE- WHO BEST TO-

01:29:53.421 --> 01:29:55.623
TALK ABOUT THIS MORE AS- OUR

01:29:55.690 --> 01:29:59.761
BUDGET PROCESS MOVES FORWARD- I

01:29:59.827 --> 01:30:03.431
DO WANT TO- SAY THAT- I DON'T

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:04.899
THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE PAYING

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:05.566
FOR THIS I THINK THIS IS

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:06.768
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE FUNDED

01:30:06.834 --> 01:30:10.171
BY THE OIL INDUSTRY- MUCH AS WE

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.340
DO WITH OTHER- CONCERNS THAT WE

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:15.476
HAVE. WITH RESPECT TO- OIL

01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:21.082
DRILLING- BUT- DO WE HAVE A

01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:22.617
SENSE OF HOW MANY CITIES AND

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.552
COUNTIES ARE COASTAL CITIES AND

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:27.922
COUNTIES HAVE FAR RESPONSE PLANS.

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:33.227
AND EQUIPMENT. I DON'T NEARLY

01:30:33.294 --> 01:30:36.397
ALL OF MY HEAD I CAN DEFINITELY

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:37.598
FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE IN

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:39.834
THE CHAIR'S OFFICE WITH THAT

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:44.305
INFORMATION- WE DO HAVE EXISTING

01:30:44.372 --> 01:30:46.174
PROGRAMS THAT ARE PRIMARILY

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.643
STRUCTURED. THROUGH THE MAJOR

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:52.013
PORTS ALONG THE COAST AND I

01:30:52.079 --> 01:30:54.148
THINK WE OUGHTA GO LOOK AT AND

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:57.285
CONSIDER WHETHER WE NEED TO TAKE

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:58.986
OUR EXISTING MODEL WITH

01:30:59.053 --> 01:31:01.722
HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SEE IF IT'S

01:31:01.789 --> 01:31:03.524

THAT OSTBERG. IT HAS BEEN WHAT

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:32.186
THIRTY ONE YEARS SINCE OCTOBER

01:31:32.253 --> 01:31:35.756
WAS APPROVED- SUIT I GUESS MY

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.025
QUESTION DIRECTOR FOR YOU IS TO

01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.995
WHAT EXTENT HAVE OUR STATE AND

01:31:41.062 --> 01:31:43.598
ENTITIES FORCE THE INDUSTRY TO

01:31:43.664 --> 01:31:44.932
DEVELOP AND DEPLOY THE

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:46.767
TECHNOLOGY TRAINING PROCEDURES

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.636
MANPOWER LEVELS OPERATIONAL

01:31:48.703 --> 01:31:50.771
METHODS THAT MEET. THE

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:53.140
TECHNOLOGY FORCING REQUIREMENTS

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:58.546
OF THE ACT AND FIVE WHAT MORE

01:31:58.613 --> 01:32:01.515
SHOULD WE BE DOING AS POLICY

MAKERS TO ENSURE THAT THE-

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.388
TECHNOLOGY FORCING LANGUAGE

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.590
WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE POWERFUL

01:32:09.657 --> 01:32:12.326
IS BEING FULLY UTILIZED TO

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:14.028
ENSURE THAT WE ARE BRINGING THE

01:32:14.095 --> 01:32:15.096
BEST THAT WERE REGULARLY

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:16.397
UPDATING BEST PRACTICES AND

01:32:16.464 --> 01:32:19.033
BRINGING THOSE TO BEAR. BOTH IN

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:24.238
PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. SO

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:27.375
COUPLE THINGS CHAIRMAN AND- NO

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:29.310
JOKE HERE THIS IS A QUESTION THE

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:31.479
ADMINISTRATOR AND I WERE JUST

01:32:31.545 --> 01:32:34.649
TALKING ABOUT AND HE- ACTUALLY.

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.517
IT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFIED

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:37.852
SPECIFIC MOMENTS AND

01:32:37.919 --> 01:32:39.220
IMPROVEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

01:32:39.287 --> 01:32:44.525
OVER THE- LAST DECADES. SO I

01:32:44.592 --> 01:32:46.560
DON'T KNOW THE ABILITY TO TOUCH

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.096
TO HIM MORE I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.232
A LIFELINE CALL TO HIM. WHAT HAS

01:32:51.299 --> 01:32:53.534
HAPPENED MOST RECENTLY NOT IN

01:32:53.601 --> 01:32:56.504
TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO ARE ALSO

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.439
SWEET AND IMPROVEMENTS THE

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:00.841
LEGISLATURE ANOTHER'S. THE

01:33:00.908 --> 01:33:03.311
FINDINGS STRUCTURE PROSPER HAS

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.913
BEEN CHANGED RECENTLY WHICH ALSO

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:09.050
LEADERSHIP TO ALLOW US TO ENSURE

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:12.620
CONTINUED CAPACITY. WE'VE ALSO

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.923
SEEN SOME CHANGES- IN THE DECADE

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.859
UP IN DIRECTOR AROUND- INSURANCE

01:33:18.926 --> 01:33:21.595
ANOTHER BUT FISCAL REQUIREMENTS

01:33:21.662 --> 01:33:24.131
ON INDUSTRY WE'VE SEEN SOME

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:27.501
CHANGES FOR- NOTIFICATION KIND

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:29.904
OF DYNAMICS SO I THINK AT LEAST

01:33:29.971 --> 01:33:32.173
IN MY TENURE THE LAST DECADE I

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:32.673
COULD POINT YOU TO SOME

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.942
IMPROVEMENTS. ON THE TECHNOLOGY

01:33:35.009 --> 01:33:38.980
SPACE- I HEAR YOU I THINK THE

01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:40.781
LEGISLATURE IS CORRECT TO PUSH

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:43.918
US TO EMBRACE THE FORCEFULNESS

01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:47.121
OF THAT STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:48.189
DO BETTER PUSHING INDUSTRY. AND

01:33:48.255 --> 01:33:49.924
UNFORTUNATELY THAT MEASURE COLIN

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:51.892
COLIN IS THE ONE WITH THE BEST

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:53.861
EXAMPLES OF THE PLACES WE HAVE

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:56.330
PUSHED THEM ON TECHNOLOGY. OKAY

01:33:56.397 --> 01:33:59.033
LET'S DO THIS LET'S ADD DIRECTOR

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:01.268
CAN YOU TRY I'M GONNA TURN AND

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:03.437
ASK A QUESTION UNRELATED TO THIS

01:34:03.504 --> 01:34:05.873
OF THE CAPTAIN WEILAND- ON IT

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.575
WHILE SOME DOING NOT CAN YOU TRY

01:34:07.641 --> 01:34:10.011
TO GET. I ADMINISTRATOR CULLEN

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:13.848
ON THIS LINE SO THAT HE CAN.

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:15.549
BONDS BOND BUT THAT QUESTION AND

01:34:15.616 --> 01:34:16.617
I THINK THERE WITH SOME OTHER

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:18.452
QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.454
MEMBERS WERE ADMINISTRATOR COLIN

01:34:20.521 --> 01:34:22.390
IS BEST POSITIONED TO RESPOND

01:34:22.456 --> 01:34:24.759

HOW THEY WERE HANDLING. SECOND

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.551
WE DID THAT IN PART BECAUSE WE

OUR CONNECTIVITY A LITTLE BIT

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:51.591

01:54:01.501 --> 01:54:03.636
TAKE AWAY AS WE- COME OUT OF

01:54:03.703 --> 01:54:05.838

01:54:12.612 --> 01:54:13.680
THEN VERIFY TO MOVE ONTO THE

01:54:13.746 --> 01:54:15.515
NEXT MEMBER IF I'VE GOT A COUPLE

01:54:15.582 --> 01:54:17.016

LOOKING TO THE BUDGET PROCESS.

01:54:23.890 --> 01:54:25.525
AS THE ACT DONE TO OFFER

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.227
CONSIDERED THE ILLOGICAL AREAS

01:54:27.293 --> 01:54:29.629
AS WELL- ALLOWING THEM TO ALSO

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:33.433
HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE OIL SPILL

BECAUSE THIS OIL SPILL IS

01:54:34.634 --> 01:54:37.070

IN ORANGE COUNTY AS WELL AND I'M

01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:46.579
SURE ACROSS THE STATE- BUT I

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:48.181
THINK IF ALLOWING THEM TO BE

INCLUDED. AND MOST OF THEM ARE

01:54:49.782 --> 01:54:53.753
NONPROFIT BOTH THE CHEEK OF THE

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:54.420
NONPROFIT. MAY EVEN TO WORK WITH

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.455
THE CITY TO HAVE THEIR OWN PLAN

01:54:55.521 --> 01:54:57.056
TO COURT WITH THE CITY THAT

01:54:57.123 --> 01:55:01.561
WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU. AND

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:02.729
THEN- MEL JUST WANT ONE MORE

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:05.965
QUESTION IS AND I'M NOT SURE IF

01:55:06.032 --> 01:55:08.234
IT'S EITHER- THE DIRECTOR

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:10.903
ADMINISTRATOR- OR MAYBE LATER

01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.939
BUT IN REGARDS TO THE CARGO

01:55:13.006 --> 01:55:15.375
SHIPS. ARE THEY GIVEN NOTICES

01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:17.210
WHERE THESE PIPELINES ARE AS

01:55:17.277 --> 01:55:19.078

THAT IT'S IT DOESN'T OCCUR AGAIN

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:35.795
AND SO I'M I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW

01:55:35.862 --> 01:55:38.298
OF IF THEY GET NOTICES AND WHERE

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:40.633

FIRST THOUGHT IS A BOY THAT

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:24.597
SO- YES THAT'S WHY THEY NEED TO

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:26.566
START A DIGGY DECOMMISSIONING

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:29.902

IS TO DO COMMISSION BY SUCH AND

01:58:33.239 --> 01:58:35.475
SUCH A DATE THAT'S BASED ON WHEN

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:36.476
THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO RUN

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:40.246
OUT OF OIL TO PUMP- M. M. A.

01:58:40.313 --> 01:58:43.249
IT'S NOT BASED ON THE NEED. TO

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:45.651
DECOMMISSION AND YOU KNOW WE

01:58:45.718 --> 01:58:47.487
BROUGH WHEN WE WERE DOING THE

01:58:47.553 --> 01:58:49.088
BILL BACK THEN WE SIT DOWN WITH

01:58:49.155 --> 01:58:51.324
OIL COMPANIES AND IN THEY WERE

01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:53.459
VERY ENCOURAGED TO TRY TO FIND A

01:58:53.526 --> 01:58:56.729
WAY. TO EXPEDITE THE

01:58:56.796 --> 01:58:59.365
DECOMMISSIONING BECAUSE- YOU

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:02.134
KNOW WHEN OIL WAS IS EIGHTY FIVE

01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:02.702
NINETY DOLLARS THEY'RE DOING

01:59:02.768 --> 01:59:04.904
WELL IF THESE OIL IS UNDER

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:05.938
SEVENTY DOLLARS A BARREL THEY'RE

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:08.107
LOSING MONEY. AND IT'S CHEAPER

01:59:08.174 --> 01:59:09.876
TO RUN THAT WAS AT A LOSS REMIT

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:13.479
IS. TO FACE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED A

01:59:13.546 --> 01:59:14.881
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:59:14.947 --> 01:59:18.217
DOLLARS TO TAKE HIM OUT. AND SO-

01:59:18.284 --> 01:59:21.087
YOU WHAT WE'VE WE'VE DEVELOPED

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:22.855

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:25.224
AND THE OIL COMPANIES WANT TO

01:59:25.291 --> 01:59:28.427

TO REACH IN LAWSUITS AND M.

01:59:39.138 --> 01:59:41.474
ALLOWED BATTLE. I THINK WE

02:06:31.650 --> 02:06:33.218
PENALTIES PAID BY THE OPERATOR

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:36.188
CREATING A PUBLIC INTEREST

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:37.523
WATCHDOG TO IMPROVE PIPELINE

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:41.226

02:06:41.293 --> 02:06:42.461
TRUST IS THE ONLY NATIONAL

02:06:42.528 --> 02:06:44.463
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT

02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:46.465
FOCUSES ON PIPELINE SAFETY. I

02:06:46.532 --> 02:06:47.800
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

02:06:47.866 --> 02:06:49.835
SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AS YOU WORK

02:06:49.902 --> 02:06:51.337
TO EXTRACT LESSONS FROM THE

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:52.938
OCTOBER FAILURE OF THE AMPLIFY

02:06:53.005 --> 02:06:54.873
ENERGY PIPELINE AND DETERMINE

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.508
WHAT ACTIONS MIGHT BE AVAILABLE

02:06:56.575 --> 02:06:58.210
TO THE ASSEMBLY TO PREVENT

02:06:58.277 --> 02:07:00.479
ADDITIONAL SPILLS AND TO IMPROVE

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:01.814
THE RESPONSE TO THOSE BILLS THAT

02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:04.550
TO HAPPEN. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS

02:07:04.616 --> 02:07:06.352
MY TESTIMONY ON TOOLS THE

02:07:06.418 --> 02:07:08.420
ASSEMBLY HAS TO REQUIRE MORE

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:09.154
FROM PIPELINE OPERATORS IN

02:07:09.221 --> 02:07:12.024
CALIFORNIA. AND ANY REGULATORY

02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:14.059
GAPS TO ADDRESS TO HELP PREVENT

02:07:14.126 --> 02:07:16.195
FUTURE SPILLS AND IMPROVE

02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:19.631
RESPONSE TO SUCH BILLS. I WOULD

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:20.699
LIKE TO IDENTIFY FOR THE

02:07:20.766 --> 02:07:22.267
COMMITTEE A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL

02:07:22.334 --> 02:07:23.369
TOOL TO ADOPT STRICTER

02:07:23.435 --> 02:07:24.903
REGULATIONS FOR FEDERALLY

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.939
REGULATED INTERSTATE PIPELINES

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:29.174
OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. THE

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.943
FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION ACT

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:32.745
ENACTED IN RESPONSE TO THE EXXON

02:07:32.811 --> 02:07:35.447
VALDEZ SPILL ALLOW STATES TO

02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:37.249
REQUIRE STRONGER PLANS THAN THE

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.485
FEDERAL REGULATIONS UNDER OIL

02:07:39.551 --> 02:07:41.653
SPILL PREVENTION LOS. AS I

02:07:41.720 --> 02:07:43.222
OUTLINED VARIOUS REGULATORY GAPS

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:44.957
I WILL IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS

02:07:45.024 --> 02:07:46.492
WHICH THE ASSEMBLY COULD

02:07:46.558 --> 02:07:47.026
POSSIBLY ADDRESS WITH THIS

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:49.461
AUTHORITY. I WILL BRIEFLY

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:50.863
DISCUSS PIPELINE SAFETY

02:07:50.929 --> 02:07:52.698
REGULATORY GAPS IN FOUR MAIN

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:55.567
AREAS CONSTRUCTION SPILL PLANS

02:07:55.634 --> 02:07:59.505
INSPECTIONS AND WE DETECTION.

02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:01.106
THEN THE REGULATIONS STATE THAT

02:08:01.173 --> 02:08:03.275
ALL OFFSHORE PIPE IN WATER

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:04.476
BETWEEN TWELVE AND TWO HUNDRED

02:08:04.543 --> 02:08:06.445
FEET IN DEPTH MUST BE BELOW THE

02:08:06.512 --> 02:08:08.247
UNDERWATER NATURAL BOTTOM UNLESS

02:08:08.313 --> 02:08:09.314
THE PAPER SUPPORTED BY

02:08:09.381 --> 02:08:10.983
STANCHIONS HELD IN PLACE BY

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:12.918
ANCHORS OR HEAVY CONCRETE

02:08:12.985 --> 02:08:15.687
COATING. THIS FAILURE SITE WAS

02:08:15.754 --> 02:08:17.289
LOCATED AT NINETY EIGHT FEET IN

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:19.124
DEPTH WHICH IS WITHIN THIS RANGE

02:08:19.191 --> 02:08:20.859
AND WAS AT ONE POINT COVERED IN

02:08:20.926 --> 02:08:23.429
CONCRETE. WE HOPE THE

02:08:23.495 --> 02:08:24.863
INVESTIGATION TELLS US WHEN THE

02:08:24.930 --> 02:08:26.698
CONCRETE COVER WAS DISTURBED AND

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:28.834
BROKEN. AND WHETHER THAT WAS

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.702
RELATED TO THE PIPES FAILURE.

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:31.970
UNFORTUNATELY THIS FILM THE

02:08:32.037 --> 02:08:34.239
REGULATION ONLY APPLIES AT THE

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:35.274
TIME OF CONSTRUCTION AND

02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:36.775
INSTALLATION THERE IS NO

02:08:36.842 --> 02:08:38.577
REQUIREMENT THAT ANY PARTICULAR

02:08:38.644 --> 02:08:40.946
DEPTH OR CONCRETE PROTECTION BE

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:42.514
MAINTAINED OVER THE LIFE OF THE

02:08:42.581 --> 02:08:44.283
PIPELINE. WE HOPE TO SEE

02:08:44.349 --> 02:08:46.652
REGULATIONS UPDATED TO REQUIRE

02:08:46.718 --> 02:08:48.587
ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF DEPTH OR

02:08:48.654 --> 02:08:51.557
PROTECTION. IMPROVEMENTS TO

02:08:51.623 --> 02:08:53.258
SPILL RESPONSE PLAN REQUIREMENTS

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:54.560
HAVE BEEN A PRIORITY THE

02:08:54.626 --> 02:08:56.562
PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST FOR YEARS.

02:08:56.628 --> 02:08:57.830
THESE PLANS ARE KEPT MOSTLY

02:08:57.896 --> 02:08:59.364
HIDDEN FROM OUTSIDE INPUT AND

02:08:59.431 --> 02:09:02.301
SCRUTINY. AMPLIFY HAD A SPILL

02:09:02.367 --> 02:09:04.303
RESPONSE PLAN IN PLACE THAT HAD

02:09:04.369 --> 02:09:06.438
BEEN APPROVED BY FEMSA. WE DON'T

02:09:06.505 --> 02:09:07.906
YET HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO

02:09:07.973 --> 02:09:09.341
KNOW HOW CLOSELY THEY FOLLOWED

02:09:09.408 --> 02:09:11.310
THAT PLAN. HOWEVER THERE ARE

02:09:11.376 --> 02:09:12.711
SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE LAWS

02:09:12.778 --> 02:09:15.147
TO BE MADE HERE. THIS IS AN AREA

02:09:15.214 --> 02:09:16.582
I BELIEVE CALIFORNIA COULD USE

02:09:16.648 --> 02:09:17.850
ITS FEDERAL OIL POLLUTION ACT

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:20.085
AUTHORITY. FOR EXAMPLE

02:09:20.152 --> 02:09:21.520
CALIFORNIA COULD REQUIRE A

02:09:21.587 --> 02:09:22.855
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD ON THIS

02:09:22.921 --> 02:09:24.723
BILL PLANS WASHINGTON STATE

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:26.258
WHO'S DONE THIS. THAT WOULD

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:27.726
ALLOW THE PUBLIC LOCAL

02:09:27.793 --> 02:09:29.828
GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER AGENCIES

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.497
TO KNOW IF AN OPERATOR HAS

02:09:31.563 --> 02:09:33.098
PROPERLY IDENTIFIED SENSITIVE

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:35.567
AREAS AND IS ADEQUATELY PREPARED

02:09:35.634 --> 02:09:37.669
TO PROTECT THEM AND WHETHER THE

02:09:37.736 --> 02:09:39.771
RESPONSE RESOURCES ARE ADEQUATE

02:09:39.838 --> 02:09:41.673
AND AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY MANNER.

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.108
FEDERAL REGULATORS REVIEWING

02:09:43.175 --> 02:09:44.610
SPILL PLANS DO NOT HAVE THE KIND

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.245
OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE THAT IS

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:47.346
IMPERATIVE IN DETERMINING THE

02:09:47.412 --> 02:09:48.547
ADEQUACY OF A SPILL RESPONSE

02:09:48.614 --> 02:09:52.417
PLAN. AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS

02:09:52.484 --> 02:09:54.219
ACCORDING TO MEDIA REPORTS

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:55.988

AND TWO OF THE IDENTIFIED EIGHT

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:01.860
ANOMALIES HAD BEEN REPAIRED

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:04.163
BEFORE THE OCTOBER FAILURE. WE

02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:05.664
DO NOT YET HAVE INFORMATION AS

02:10:05.731 --> 02:10:06.832
TO WHETHER THE FAILURE SITE

02:10:06.899 --> 02:10:08.433
CORRESPONDS TO ONE OF THE

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.602
IDENTIFIED ANOMALIES. THE FILM

02:10:10.669 --> 02:10:12.137
THE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT RULES

02:10:12.204 --> 02:10:13.505
THAT APPLY TO THIS LINE WOULD

02:10:13.572 --> 02:10:15.841
REQUIRE AN ASSESSMENT ONCE EVERY

02:10:15.908 --> 02:10:17.843
FIVE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT

02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:19.545
CALIFORNIA COULD AS PART OF ITS

02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:21.313
OIL SPILL PREVENTION LAWS

02:10:21.380 --> 02:10:22.681
REQUIRE MORE FREQUENT

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:23.782
ASSESSMENTS OF WHETHER THE

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:30.589

02:10:44.503 --> 02:10:46.538
APPLY TO OFFSHORE PIPE. THE

02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:47.673
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE COULD

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:49.608

FOR THE PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST.

02:32:14.992 --> 02:32:17.261
WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:20.798
PAST WEEK DETECTION SYSTEMS AND

02:32:20.865 --> 02:32:24.301
HOW QUICKLY WOULD AN OPERATOR

02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:24.935
KNOW THAT THEIR SYSTEM COULD BE

02:32:25.002 --> 02:32:28.172
LEAKING. IT'S A IT'S A

02:32:28.239 --> 02:32:30.407
COMPLICATED QUESTION. THERE'S A

02:32:30.474 --> 02:32:32.009
COUPLE COMPONENTS THAT GO INTO A

02:32:32.076 --> 02:32:34.078
LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM. YOU KNOW

02:32:34.144 --> 02:32:36.180
ONE IS THE VOLUME OF PRODUCT

02:32:36.247 --> 02:32:38.883
THAT'S LEAKING VERSES- THE TIME

02:32:38.949 --> 02:32:41.785
PERIOD YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT- SO

02:32:41.852 --> 02:32:42.887
ANYTIME THERE HAVE BEEN

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:45.289
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR MORE

02:32:45.356 --> 02:32:47.625
STRICT STANDARDS PUT ONLY

02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:48.659
DETECTION SYSTEMS THEY'VE

02:32:48.726 --> 02:32:51.228
INVOLVED- RATHER THAN

02:32:51.295 --> 02:32:53.764
PRESCRIPTION AS TO WHAT KIND OF

02:32:53.831 --> 02:32:54.965
LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM THEY HAVE

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:56.567
TO HAVE THEY'VE BEEN PERFORMANCE

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:58.836
STANDARDS. SO ALASKA'S EXAMPLE

02:32:58.903 --> 02:33:01.438
IS- OPERATORS NEED TO HAVE A

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:03.541
LEAK DETECTION SYSTEM CAPABLE OF

02:33:03.607 --> 02:33:05.276
PROMPTLY DETECTING A LEAK OF AT

02:33:05.342 --> 02:33:08.612
LEAST 1% OF DAILY THROUGHPUT.

02:33:08.679 --> 02:33:10.447
WASHINGTON STATE OF WASHINGTON

02:33:10.514 --> 02:33:13.617
HAS- ASKED THAT ALL LEAK

02:33:13.684 --> 02:33:15.019
DETECTION SYSTEMS MUST BE

02:33:15.085 --> 02:33:17.154
CAPABLE OF DETECTING 8% OF

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:19.323
MAXIMUM FLOW RATE WITHIN FIFTEEN

02:33:19.390 --> 02:33:21.458
MINUTES. SO THOSE BOTH SEEM TO

02:33:21.525 --> 02:33:24.595
BE KIND OF REASONABLE- OPERATORS

02:33:24.662 --> 02:33:25.896
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REASONABLY

02:33:25.963 --> 02:33:33.304
MEET THOSE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

02:33:33.370 --> 02:33:36.040

02:33:36.106 --> 02:33:38.075
CHAIR- IF I UNDERSTAND IT

02:33:38.142 --> 02:33:39.777
CORRECTLY I THINK THIS QUESTION

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.946
WOULD BE FOR- EITHER OF THE-

02:33:42.012 --> 02:33:43.647
STATE FIRE MARSHAL'S- THERE'S

02:33:43.714 --> 02:33:46.750
ABOUT. FIFTY SIX HUNDRED MILES

02:33:46.817 --> 02:33:50.554
OF INTERSTATE PIPELINE AND- AND-

02:33:50.621 --> 02:33:56.760
I'M TOLD- AND IF THAT PIPELINE

02:33:56.827 --> 02:33:58.996
IS OPERATED AT LOW PRESSURE THEN

02:33:59.063 --> 02:34:02.032
THEY'RE SUBJECT TO A FIVE YEAR

02:34:02.099 --> 02:34:04.068
INSPECTION REGIMEN AS OPPOSED

02:34:04.134 --> 02:34:07.371
TO- ONE TWO YEARS THE STATE

02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:10.107
REQUIRES FOR. APPLIES THAT ARE

02:34:10.174 --> 02:34:12.543
OPERATED AT HIGHER PRESSURE THAT

02:34:12.610 --> 02:34:16.113
ESSENTIALLY CORRECT. EIGHT EIGHT

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:20.484
YES SIR- ESSENTIALLY IT WAS

02:34:20.551 --> 02:34:23.887
UNDER STATE- REGULATIONS WHICH

02:34:23.954 --> 02:34:26.323
IS FINE LINE IS NOT. IT WOULD

02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:27.424
HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BE

02:34:27.491 --> 02:34:29.159
INSPECTED ANNUALLY BUT ONCE

02:34:29.226 --> 02:34:33.864
AGAIN- DUE TO SB ONE SIXTY NINE

02:34:33.931 --> 02:34:35.532
AND A CURRENT REGULATIONS WE

02:34:35.599 --> 02:34:39.837
WOULD NOT PAY EVEN OUR PROGRAM

02:34:39.903 --> 02:34:41.138
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO.

02:34:41.205 --> 02:34:43.140
FORMAT INSPECTION BECAUSE IT

02:34:43.207 --> 02:34:44.908
DOESN'T FOLLOW THE CALIFORNIA

02:34:44.975 --> 02:34:46.243
CODE BUT IT FALLS UNDER THE

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:48.212
FEDERAL CODE SO WE WOULD HAVE

02:34:48.278 --> 02:34:52.683
INSPECTED IT AT THAT- FIVE YEAR

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:58.389
INTERVAL AS WELL. OF FOLLOWING

02:34:58.455 --> 02:35:01.825
UP ON THAT WITH THE TWO OF THE-

02:35:01.892 --> 02:35:05.029
PIPELINE SAFETY TRUST. ARE WE

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:06.730
ARE THE REASONS A PIPELINE

02:35:06.797 --> 02:35:08.298
OPERATOR WHICH USED TO OPERATE

02:35:08.365 --> 02:35:12.169
THE PIPELINE AT A LOWER CAPACITY

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:12.736
OR PRESSURE WHAT WITH THOSE

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:17.808
RACES BE- YES THERE ARE REASONS-

02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:21.412
IT COULD BE. THAT IS AN AGING

02:35:21.478 --> 02:35:22.746
PIPELINE AND THEY UNDERSTAND

02:35:22.813 --> 02:35:24.581
THAT THERE ARE SOME WEAKNESSES

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:26.617
AND THAT IT CAN OPERATE MAYBE A

02:35:26.684 --> 02:35:27.918
LITTLE SAFER AT ALL AT LOWER

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:30.487
PRESSURE AND- THEY AND NOT TO

02:35:30.554 --> 02:35:31.789
PUSH THE ENVELOPE THERE'S ALSO

02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:33.357
DEMAND REASONS OF WHY THEY

02:35:33.424 --> 02:35:34.692
WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH

02:35:34.758 --> 02:35:37.061
PRODUCT THROUGH IT AT ONE TIME-

02:35:37.127 --> 02:35:38.662
STORAGE ISSUES THINGS LIKE THAT

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:39.596
SO THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF

02:35:39.663 --> 02:35:41.231
REASONS OF WHY AN OPERATOR WOULD

02:35:41.298 --> 02:35:43.534
CHOOSE TO. RUN AT LOW PRESSURE

02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:46.136
AT WOULD BE OUR A-

02:35:46.203 --> 02:35:50.407
COMPARATIVELY- LESS RESTRICTIVE.

02:35:50.474 --> 02:35:52.543
INSPECTION REGIMENT B. ONE OF

02:35:52.609 --> 02:35:56.313
THOSE REASONS. I'M NOT SURE I'M

02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:58.082
I'M NOT SURE HOW BURDENSOME THAT

02:35:58.148 --> 02:36:00.017
INSPECTION REQUIREMENT WOULD BE

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:02.119
IF THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO. HAVE

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.821
THEM RUN AT LOWER PRESSURE OKAY

02:36:03.887 --> 02:36:09.693
THANK YOU. OTHER QUITE ANY OTHER

02:36:09.760 --> 02:36:11.328
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:13.330

MADAM CHAIR- CHIEF OSTLER

02:36:15.499 --> 02:36:17.334
MENTION INCREASE REGULATIONS

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:19.903
WERE PROPOSED VIA S. B. ONE

02:36:19.970 --> 02:36:21.972
SIXTY NINE JACKSON. AS THAT BILL

02:36:22.039 --> 02:36:22.706
DID NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE

02:36:22.773 --> 02:36:24.641
LEGISLATORS WHAT OTHER MEASURES

02:36:24.708 --> 02:36:26.210
NOT ADDRESSED IN THAT BILL COULD

02:36:26.276 --> 02:36:27.911
BE INDUCED NERDIST THAT WOULD BE

02:36:27.978 --> 02:36:29.513
BENEFICIAL TO YOUR OFFICE AND

02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:33.250
STATE TO ENSURE WE FIND

02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:37.421
TROUBLESOME PLATFORMS AND MILES.

02:36:37.488 --> 02:36:39.523
I BELIEVE THE QUESTION IS ARE

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:41.391
THERE ADDITIONAL ITEMS IN THAT

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:44.261
BILL THAT WOULD HELP. IS THAT A

02:36:44.328 --> 02:36:50.434
CORRECT STATEMENT. YES SIR- I

02:36:50.501 --> 02:36:51.802
BELIEVE THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:54.571
ITEMS THAT WOULD HELP US IN

02:36:54.638 --> 02:36:56.607
THAT- PROFIT IN THAT THE BILL

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:59.843
ALSO- THERE ARE OTHER ITEMS THAT

02:36:59.910 --> 02:37:01.645
COULD BE REVIEWED IN ANY OTHER

02:37:01.712 --> 02:37:04.515
PART ONE AT THAT THE WE BELIEVE

02:37:04.581 --> 02:37:08.085
WOULD BENEFIT THE- REGULATORY

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:18.495
ABILITY- THE STATE FARM ARE. I

02:37:18.562 --> 02:37:19.630
KEEP JUST FOLLOWING UP ON THAT

02:37:19.696 --> 02:37:21.465
QUESTION WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO

02:37:21.532 --> 02:37:23.133
ELABORATE ON SOME OF THOSE

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:27.271
OPPORTUNITIES. I THINK THEY

02:37:27.337 --> 02:37:30.340
PROBABLY- DUE TO THE LIMITED

02:37:30.407 --> 02:37:31.909
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE GOING ON

02:37:31.975 --> 02:37:34.311
WITH ME I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE

02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:37.047
BEST IF WE COULD- MEETING WITH

02:37:37.114 --> 02:37:40.651
YOUR OFFICES AND- DISCUSS THAT

02:37:40.717 --> 02:37:44.488
LEVEL OF DETAIL. AND PROVIDE

02:37:44.555 --> 02:37:48.058
SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. YES

02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:49.126
I THINK WE WILL CERTAINLY TAKE

02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:51.295
THAT AS A FOLLOW UP FROM TWO

02:37:51.361 --> 02:37:55.299
DAYS A CONVERSATION AND FIVE. IT

02:37:55.365 --> 02:37:57.401
CERTAINLY DID SOUND FROM YOUR

02:37:57.467 --> 02:37:59.203
TESTIMONY AS AS WELL AS AS FROM

02:37:59.269 --> 02:38:01.839
YOUR IS THAT THERE IS. AN

02:38:01.905 --> 02:38:05.742
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO STRENGTHEN

02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:08.645
AND STATE REGULATIONS RELATED TO

02:38:08.712 --> 02:38:10.480
LOW PRESSURE PIPELINES IN

02:38:10.547 --> 02:38:12.182
PARTICULAR AND THAT THERE
