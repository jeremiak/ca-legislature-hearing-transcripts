QUESTION TO MARK I'M NOT SURE

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:38.403
EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE TO

A LONG TIME NOW WE HAD

IS GENERALLY NOT A FIELD THAT

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:36.140

OPHTHALMOLOGIST. AND SO WE HAD

00:35:05.837 --> 00:35:08.206
NO JURISDICTION BUT IT IS A

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:10.842
GROWING MATTER- THE WORKGROUP

THAT YOU'LL BE ON THE FOREFRONT

00:37:21.205 --> 00:37:22.773

00:58:56.399 --> 00:58:58.101
TRYING TO WORK ON THAT. MY

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.903
QUESTION GOES TO AND IT COMES

00:58:59.969 --> 00:59:01.804
FROM MY BACKGROUND BOTH AS A

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:04.908
MILITARY GUY IN MY PAST. AND I

00:59:04.974 --> 00:59:08.111
ONCE WAS A LAWYER. AND

00:59:08.177 --> 00:59:11.114
CERTIFICATIONS- HAVE MEANING.

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.450
TO MOST PEOPLE. AND SO WHEN YOU

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.286
HAVE AN OPTOMETRIST TO

00:59:16.352 --> 00:59:17.520
CERTIFIES THAT THEY HAVE

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:19.589
COMPLETED CONTINUING EDUCATION

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:21.391
REQUIREMENTS AND THEN YOU AUDIT

00:59:21.457 --> 00:59:23.493
AND 31% OF THEM HAVING

00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:25.161
CERTIFIED THAT THEY'VE DONE THE

00:59:25.228 --> 00:59:27.297
JOB THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.731
YOU FIND THAT THEY HAVE NOT I

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:29.933
GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHAT

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:32.101
HAPPENS TO THEM AND I NOTICE IN

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.069
THE BACKGROUND PAPER THEY'RE

00:59:33.136 --> 00:59:34.971
SUBJECT TO A CITATION OR FORMAL

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:37.440
DISCIPLINE. I WOULD ASSUME THAT

00:59:37.507 --> 00:59:40.243
IF INTEGRITY BEING WHAT IT IS

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:40.977
AND YOU WILL HAVE TO CHARGE

00:59:41.044 --> 00:59:43.146
CONDITIONS AND WE DEPEND ON

00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:44.314
HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:45.882
CHART ACCURATELY AND WHAT THEY

00:59:45.949 --> 00:59:47.717
PUT DOWN AS WHAT THEY SEE WHAT

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:50.653
HAPPENS TO THESE PEOPLE THE 31%

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.889
OF THEM WHO. SAY THEY DID IT

00:59:52.956 --> 00:59:57.560
BUT DIDN'T DO IT. YEAH YOU KNOW

00:59:57.627 --> 00:59:58.895
WE USED TO LIKE MY MOTHER MY

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:00.196
MOTHER USED TO SAY IF YOU KNOW

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.298
OF THOSE WHO LIVE WILL CHEAT

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:06.336
RIGHT. SO. SO WHAT WE FIND IN

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.571
OUR AUDIT THAT THAT 31% FAILURE

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:12.642
DOESN'T INCLUDE THOSE WHO. WISH

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:13.142
I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:15.778
ATTENDING A SESSION THAT WAS-

01:00:15.845 --> 01:00:17.480
EITHER WOULD WOULD COUNT TOWARD

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:18.915
THIRTY THING EDUCATION BUT IN

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:20.550
FACT IT HADN'T BEEN VERIFIED BY

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.986
COKE- THE NATIONAL. OR BY THE

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:26.155
BOARD ITSELF- AND SO THAT WAS

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:27.690
YOU KNOW A MISTAKE ON THEIR

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:28.958
PART WE ASK THEM TO GO BACK

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:32.061
AND- CORRECT THAT GOING WE TAKE

01:00:32.128 --> 01:00:33.463
THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT THEY

01:00:33.529 --> 01:00:34.630
THOUGHT THEY WERE DEALING BY

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.933
ATTENDING ANOTHER- WORKSHOPS

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.267
AND TO DO THAT WORK IN A

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:40.003
CERTAIN TIME PERIOD USUALLY

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.603
THIRTY TO SIXTY DAYS DEPENDING

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:45.108
ON THE NUMBER- THE- PREDATOR

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:47.076
MISTAKE- AND- THEN YOU KNOW. IT

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:49.278
ALSO. BE SURE THAT THIS WILL BE

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.647
A PART OF WHAT YOUR SHOULD BE

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.882
DOING GOING FORWARD REMEMBER

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:54.884
THIS IS OUR MEDIATION- WE TELL

01:00:54.951 --> 01:01:01.190
THEM UNTIL. WE ASK THAT THEY-

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.892
QUICKLY FINISH THOSE- UNIT BUT

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:05.528
THEY HAVE BEEN HADN'T THE BILL.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:08.531
ON EIGHT EIGHT ARE. THE INCLUDE

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:10.033
RARITY THAT WE GET SOME WHO HAS

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:14.771
JUST FALSE- BUT WE FIRST WORK

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:16.572
IN THE IF YOU ACTION WE WORK TO

01:01:16.639 --> 01:01:18.541
GET THEM TO COME- ETHICALLY

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:20.743
FORTY THAT THAT ISN'T-

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.612
HAPPENING. WE HAVE COURSE ARE

01:01:22.678 --> 01:01:25.314
TO BE BACK TO. OUR PORTAL TO.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:26.883
IN ORDER GET THE EXACTLY IF YOU

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:28.751
CAN HOLD PUBLIC TOWN AND I KNOW

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.253
THE WE'VE GOT- PRACTITIONERS

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:31.754
ARE WILLING TO CHEAT THEIR OWN

01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:33.723
THE AND POSSIBLY. WHEN THEY'RE

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.191
DEALING THE FOR TAX OF THE

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:35.825
PRINTER THAT IS VERY VERY HIGH

01:01:35.892 --> 01:01:37.560
AND ABSOLUTE CAN THAT OCCUR I

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:38.628
COULD SEE HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:40.363
WHERE YOU THINK YOU'RE PICKING

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.701
A COURSE THAT QUALIFIES. IT

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:46.836
DOESN'T QUITE. OR YOU THINK YOU

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:47.637
HAVE TWENTY FIVE HOURS BUT YOU

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:48.204
ONLY HAVE TWENTY FOUR POINT

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:51.607
FIVE. AND I'M PLEASED TO HEAR

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:53.643
THAT YOU SAY THAT THE ONES THAT.

01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.144
CLEARLY YOU'RE TRYING TO GAME

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.846
THE SYSTEM ARE VERY VERY FEW

01:01:56.913 --> 01:01:58.948
AND THAT'S A THAT'S COMFORTING

01:01:59.015 --> 01:01:59.415
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.884
INFORMATION. ON THE IN THE AREA

01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:03.920
OF- ENFORCEMENT AND COST

01:02:03.986 --> 01:02:05.388
RECOVERY OF THIS THIS QUESTION

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:06.956
BEFORE AND IF IT'S NOT AN

01:02:07.023 --> 01:02:08.558
INTELLIGENT QUESTION IT'S VERY

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:09.959
POSSIBLE THAT IT'S NOT AND YOU

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:12.095
CAN LET ME KNOW. I HAVE THICK

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:14.497
SKIN BUT- WE HAVE A CHART IN%

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:15.765
OUR BACKGROUND PAPER THAT TALKS

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.967
ABOUT POTENTIAL CASES FOR COST

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.536
RECOVERY IN CASES. WHERE

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:23.339
RECOVERY- WHAT RECOVERY WAS

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.542
ORDERED. HELLO I'M TRYING AND

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:28.077
THEN THE AMOUNT COLLECTED AND

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:30.213
I'M TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.281
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR COST

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:34.917
RECOVERY PROGRAM AND WHAT I

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:37.553
THINK IS MISSING IN IS WHAT

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.322
WERE THE ENFORCEMENTEXPENSES

01:02:39.388 --> 01:02:41.858
IN CASES WHERE RECOVERY WAS

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:45.495
AUTHORIZED. SO I CAN MEASURE

01:02:45.561 --> 01:02:48.064
THE COST RECOVERY AGAINST THE

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.366
EXPENSES IN CASES WHERE COST

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:53.136
RECOVERY WAS AUTHORIZED AS

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:55.071
OPPOSED TO TOTAL EXPENSES DOES

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.440
THAT MAKE SENSE. AND YOU MAY

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.609
NOT HAVE THIS IT MAY BE A MIS

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.410
READ THIS CHART AND IF SO YOU

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:02.278
CAN LET ME KNOW BUT IF I

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.915
HAVEN'T MAYBE IF NOT NOW AT

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:07.850
SOME POINT YOU CAN LET ME KNOW.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:12.421
HOW THOSE COSTS. MEASURE UP.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.689
YEAH YEAH I THINK THAT THIS IS

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:14.724
A VERY MUCH INTELLIGENT

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.459
QUESTIONS THERE ARE THANK YOU

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:17.860
FOR BRINGING IT TO ME- AT THE

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:18.928
END WE HAVE HAD SOME

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.229
CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS CHART

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:21.664
AND AROUND PROJECTED BIRTH

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.900
COLLECTED COST RECOVERY. ALSO

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:26.202
THE ISSUE RATE THAT WE AND OUR

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.937
COST RECOVERY DON'T ACCOUNT FOR

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:30.039
THE TIME OUR ANALYSTS TO DO

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:33.075
THAT INVESTIGATION- SO HEIR

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.978
COST RECOVERY ISN'T A TRUE-

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.780
ESTIMATION OF WHAT. THE BOARD

01:03:37.847 --> 01:03:40.116
ACTUALLY PUT INTO- EIGHT

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:42.952
BRINGING THIS CASE TO- TO

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:45.888
CLOSER- BUT I WILL NOT MAKE UP

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:47.690
RIGHT THERE. WE'RE TO GET NEW

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.425
WORDS STAY IN MY LANE- I THINK

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.727
YOU KNOW IT IF YOU DON'T MIND-

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:53.296
RECORD THING THAT THE NUMBER OF

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.364
THE CHART- WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO

01:03:55.431 --> 01:03:56.666
IS TO GO BACK TO WITH OUR

01:03:56.732 --> 01:03:58.201
ENFORCEMENT STAFF. COMMENTED

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:00.403

WHY I'M LOOKING AT A MY PAY

01:04:14.817 --> 01:04:15.785
NUMBERING IS THE SAME AS THE

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:16.619
ONE THAT'S SUPPOSED IS PAID

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:17.453
FIFTEEN. OF THIRTY THREE PAGE.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.087
OF THIRTY THREE ON THE BACK ROW

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.322
MATERIAL. AND IT LISTS EXAMPLE

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.791
AN EFFORT TWENTY. TWENTY TOTAL

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.960
ENFORCEMENT EXPENDITURES.

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:26.195
POTENTIAL CASES FOR RECOVERY.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:28.297
CASES RECOVERY ORDERED AMOUNT

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:30.733
OF COST RECOVERY ORDERED SEVEN-

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.468
THIS IS AN THOUSAND SO. I

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.203
ASSUME IT'S A HUNDRED AND

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.205
SEVENTY THOUSAND. AND THEN THE

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:38.975
AMOUNT COLLECTED. TWO HUNDRED

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:39.575
TWENTY THOUSAND AND I'M JUST

01:04:39.642 --> 01:04:41.177
TRYING TO THIS ASSESS THE

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.178
EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR COST

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:44.247
RECOVERY. IN THOSE CASES WHERE

01:04:44.313 --> 01:04:46.382
COST RECOVERY IS AUTHORIZED SO

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.483
I SORT OF NEED TO KNOW THE

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.785
TOTAL EXPENSES IN THOSE CASES

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:52.221
VERSUS THE TOTAL EXPENSES.

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:54.290
SHEPHERD SURE I COULD STOP ME A

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.891
FIRE TRUCK IF I PUT MY FOOT IN

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.526
MY MOUTH BUT YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:59.562
OUR MORE EGREGIOUS CASES MORE

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:02.198
MORE MORE EXPENSIVE CASES ARE.

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.700
WHERE THE- LICENSEE. JUST IT

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.302
IS. WHAT GIVES UP THEIR

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:09.572
LICENSE. AND WE NEVER HEAR FROM

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:13.075
AGAIN THOSE CASES ARE- GREGIS

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:16.379
PROBABLY. ARE VERY EXPENSIVE

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.180
BUT ARE NOT THE KIND OF CASE

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:19.448
THAT WE CAN CHASE AFTER THOSE

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.350
PEOPLE SAFE GIVEN UP THEIR

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.586
LICENSES I UNDERSTAND THAT SO I

01:05:23.653 --> 01:05:25.388
CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT OKAY

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:28.457
THANK YOU I JUST WAS TRYING TO.

HAVE THE RIGHT DATA IN ORDER TO

01:05:32.862 --> 01:05:34.130
DO IT AND IF I DO JUST JUST LET

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.532

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:37.867
STOP TALKING HERE AND ONE

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:40.102
MICROSECOND BUT- I'VE ASKED

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:41.370
THIS QUESTION OF OTHER BOARDS

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.239
AS WELL. AND I WHAT I'M TRYING

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:44.640

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:46.142
ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION AND

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:48.511
DISCIPLINE. IS THE LENGTH OF

01:05:48.577 --> 01:05:51.213
TIME THAT IT TAKES. TO PROCESS

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.149
A CASE ONCE TO AN INVESTIGATION

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.584
HAS CONCLUDED. THAT A DECISION

01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.787
IS MADE TO PROCEED WITH

INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED TO

01:06:26.315 --> 01:06:27.750
THE DATE THE DISCIPLINARY

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:34.657
ACTION IS FINISHED. I'M NOT

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:35.624
SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE TWO

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.294
DIFFERENCES THAT IN TOTAL. FOUR

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.795

IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:52.208
THE DELAY OCCURS I HAVE TO HAVE

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.976

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.510
ACTUALLY WILL. I APPRECIATE

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.777
YOUR EXPLANATION I THINK IT

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:09.945
DOES STILL REPRESENT  SYSTEM

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:12.848
FAILURE THAT- A THIRD OF A

01:09:12.915 --> 01:09:14.483
CENTURY 31% EVERYONE THE

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.318
AUDITED DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.454
WHAT SEAT THEY NEED TO DO. AND

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:19.788
SO PERHAPS IT NEEDS TO BE MORE

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.724
CLARITY TO THE OPTOMETRY

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.459
COMMUNITY AS TO WHAT TO SEE

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:24.760
REQUIREMENTS ACTUALLY ARE IF

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:26.562
THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEIR

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:28.030
COURSES THEY TOOK DIDN'T FIT

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.865
CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. ACCORDING

01:09:29.932 --> 01:09:31.600
TO THE BOARD BUT I ALSO WOULD

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.203
MAKE NOTE OF THAT- IS MENTIONED

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:38.207
HERE. THAT THERE ARE ONLY THREE

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:38.841
HUNDRED TWENTY ONE AUDITS OVER

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:40.776
THE PAST FOUR PASSED FOR FISCAL

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:44.213
YEAR SO THAT MEANS THE ONLY

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.981
AUDITED EIGHTY. FOR WEALTHY.

01:09:46.048 --> 01:09:47.850
YOU CAN ON AVERAGE EIGHTY PER

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:48.851
YEAR THEY'VE MADE AND SOME

01:09:48.918 --> 01:09:50.486
VARIATIONS BETWEENYEARS YET

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.388
ALSO YOU REPORTED YOU DUDE.

01:09:52.454 --> 01:09:54.423
TWELVE THOUSAND. RENEWALS

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.058
ANNUALLY. WHICH MEANS YOU'RE

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.895
ONLY AUDITING POINT 7% OF ALL

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:02.331
THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE IN DOING ON

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:04.967
AVERAGE- IN TERMS OF YOU SEE

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.036
AUDITS AND- EVEN WITH ONLY

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:08.837
POINT SEVEN YOU STILL FOUND

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.106
THIRTY ONE PERCENT. WITH CCL

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:13.442
YEARS- AND I THINK IT BROUGHT

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:15.144
THIS UP AT THE LAST REVIEW IS

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:18.714
THERE SOME INTENT TO PERHAPS I

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.349
MEAN AGAIN THE ONLY DODD

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:21.650
EVERYBODY NECESSARILY BUT

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.586
PERHAPS OF LARGER SAMPLE SIZE

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:26.355
TEN POINT 7% ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:10:26.422 --> 01:10:26.989
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SUCH A HIGH

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:30.159
FAILURE RATE- AND IF IT'S- IN

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.727
AGAIN. IF IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.462
DON'T KNOW WHICH CEDAR SUPPOSED

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:34.496
TO TAKE PERHAPS YOU SHOULD TAKE

01:10:34.563 --> 01:10:35.764
THAT USE THAT FEEDBACK TO

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.166
IMPROVE THE COMMUNICATION SO

01:10:37.232 --> 01:10:38.734
THAT WE SEE AN IMPROVEMENT AND

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:40.803
THE COMPLIANCE RATE WITH. WITH

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.638
THE COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS

01:10:42.705 --> 01:10:43.606
SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO YOUR PLANS

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:46.675
FOR. AUDITS INTO THE FUTURE IN

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:47.910
TERMS OF THE RATE THE

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.879
PERCENTAGE YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:54.917
PLANT AUDIT OF THE RENEWALS.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.585
YOUR TARGET FOR EACH YEAR IT'S

01:10:56.652 --> 01:10:58.621
5% AND IN SOME OF THE FACTS

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:01.390
FOUR. YEARS WE HAD LET OUR 5%

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:04.593
EACH YEAR- AND IN FACT WE'VE

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.730
HAD. ANY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:10.299
WHAT LOSS OF STAFF- HERE WE

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:14.269
HAVE NOT BEEN A TO- YEAH. THE

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.572
EQUINE ON IT I'M A BIT THE

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.140
NATION BEFORE- WE THE L.

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.609
NATALIE RECOGNIZED- WHO JUST

01:11:20.676 --> 01:11:23.012
WALK AGAIN ANOTHER SENIOR STAFF

01:11:23.078 --> 01:11:24.780
WORK WITHOUT NUMBER- IN THE

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.749
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT- WE

01:11:26.815 --> 01:11:29.284
ARE HIRING TO BACK FILL THAT ON

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.587
A AND E'S OSTACLE YOU'RE

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:32.221
TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:34.089
TWO. I'M MORE OPERATE BRING

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.457
INTENT HEALTH LICENSING AND

01:11:35.524 --> 01:11:37.860
ENFORCEMENT I'M ALSO CURRENTLY

01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:38.894
GOING THROUGH THE HIRING

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.095
PROCESS BUT WHICH HIRED A NEW

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.730
WITH COMPLETELY WHAT I WANNA DO

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:44.066
IS. MAKE SURE THAT WE GOT THE

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.834
HELP THAT WE GOT CROSS TRAINING

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.270
ACROSS MORE EXACT. UNTIL IT'S

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.673
NOT VIOLATE ONE ONE PERSON LEAD

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:51.907
THE PROGRAM. IT'S JUST NO

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.610
LONGER UP. UNTIL WE ANTICIPATE

01:11:54.677 --> 01:12:03.619
A LOT OF THE LATTER. OF

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:04.620
CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY.

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:06.989
TRAINING AT- AND- PRODUCE MORE

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:11.026
OF THE TRAINING PROCESS AND THE

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:13.862
CONTINUING THAT IS- PORTION OF

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.865
MORE JACK I'M NOT A FIVE ACROSS.

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:18.233
OKAY SO HEAR THE GOLD FIVE FOR

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.868
A YEAR WHICH IS KIND OF SIMILAR

01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:21.036
TO OTHER BOY BUT- I WOULD MAKE

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.639
NO THAT. AND YET I APPRECIATE

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:28.110
YOUR- ISSUES- DEALER IT SPIN

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.445
QUITE A FEW YEARS ARE READY SIR-

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:30.312
AND I BROUGHT IT UP THE LAST

01:12:30.379 --> 01:12:31.914
REVIEW SO- HOPEFULLY THIS'LL BE

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.383
MORE OF A- IN TERMS OF TRYING

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:37.453
TO GET TO THAT 5% ANDY AND THEN

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:39.521
AGAIN AS I MENTIONED- ALSO

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:41.523
BETTER EITHER BUT WE NEED TO

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.692
CLARIFY THE REQUIREMENTS OR DO

01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:45.928
SOME OTHER THING BECAUSE THE

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.362
31% FAILURE RATE EVEN IF IT

01:12:47.429 --> 01:12:49.064
TURNS OUT YEAH AND IT IS

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:49.965
PROBLEMATIC SOMEWHERE

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:50.833
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.067
SOMEWHERE THERE SO IT'S EITHER

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.569
THE APPLICANTS ARE DOING IT.

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:54.570
BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.138
SOME RISK UNDERSTANDING THAN WE

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.173
NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION THE

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.942
OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE C. E.

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:01.543
IS THAT. DOING EDUCATION IS

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:03.312
THAT DO YOU HAVE DOES THE BOARD

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:06.048
HAVE ANY POLICY OR THERE ARE

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:07.382
THE PEOPLE WHO CERTIFIED THE C.

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.084
E. AND TERMS OF ENSURING THAT

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:10.652
THERE ARE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:11.587
BETWEEN THE PEOPLE PRESENTING

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:13.088
THE C. E. THAT THEY'LL HAVE

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.556
FINANCIAL CONFLICTS SO WE WANNA

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.058
BE SURE DISCONTINUING EDUCATION

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:18.193
NOT A MARKETING OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:18.827
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AT. TEACHING

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:21.563
THIS. HE SPEAK TO A CONFLICT OF

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:22.998
INTEREST POLICIES FOR

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:25.667
CONTINUING EDUCATION. SO I CAN.

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.770
TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:30.272
QUESTION- BEFORE I BECAME THE

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:34.076
PRESIDENT BORE I SERVED ON THE-

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:34.777
ON THE SPROXIL EDUCATION

01:13:34.843 --> 01:13:36.712
COMMITTEE. AND THAT COMMITTEE

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:40.916
REVIEWS ALMOST ALL THE-

01:13:40.983 --> 01:13:42.484
PRESENTATIONS BEFORE THEY'RE

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.219
APPROVED- INCLUDING THE

01:13:44.286 --> 01:13:46.121
SPEAKERS THEIR BACKGROUNDS. AND

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.357
THE MATERIALS THE ACTUAL POWER

01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:52.694
POINTS- THAT WILL BE PRESENTED.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.297
OUR SHARE IS A AT UC BERKELEY

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.599
OPTOMETRY PROFESSOR. AND AS YOU

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.335
MIGHT GUESS- DEFINITION OF

01:14:00.402 --> 01:14:03.438
EDUCATION IS PRETTY HOT. AND I

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.741
CAN SAY BASED ON MY SERVICE ON

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:06.842
THE PRACTICING EDUCATION

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:10.012
COMMITTEE- THE BOARD MEMBERS ON

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:12.781
THAT COMMITTEE ARE ARE NOT

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.483
GOING TO IMPROVE SOME YELP

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.186
SALES JOB YOU KNOW SOME AMWAY

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.754
OR AYE DON'T WANT TO DISCOURAGE

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.088
FAMILY BUT I'VE BEEN YOU KNOW

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:20.889
COAXED INTO THESE YOU KNOW

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.558
MARKETING SCHEMES THAT THAT

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:25.494
WITHOUT. WITHOUT BEINGINFORMED

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.329
AT THE OUTSET SO WE'RE LOOKING

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.464
AT THE MATERIALS AND I BELIEVE

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.266
REJECTED FROM SOME-

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:33.502
PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.270
LOOK LIKE MARKETING AND WE NEED

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:38.807
TO FOCUS ON IT HAS TO BE

01:14:38.874 --> 01:14:40.209
EDUCATION. SO I APPRECIATE THAT

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.777
WORKS DONE I THINK COULD BE

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:43.178
HELPFUL SINCE OF THE BOARD HAS

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:44.880
THAT ROLE IN REVIEWING AND

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.481
APPROVING- CONTINUING

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.450
EDUCATION. THAT PERHAPS THERE

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.018
SHOULD BE SOME BOARD POLICY AS

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:52.087
WELL THAT- BACKS UP THIS

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.823
ACTIVITY. REGARDING DISCLOSING

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.191
FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND OF

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.694
COURSE- BE SURE THAT THERE'S

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.696
CLEARLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:02.164
TAKING THESE COURSES THAT IT

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.799
OKAY BEEN REVIEWED FOR THESE

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.067
FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF THERE

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:07.102
ARE. EITHER DEAD THEY'RE NOT

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.304
PROVED OR ALSO IF- IF IT LOOKS

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:10.973
LIKE IT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:12.541
ENOUGH TO BE OF MAJOR CONCERN

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:13.675
BUT STILL THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:15:13.742 --> 01:15:14.643
DISCLOSING THE POTENTIAL

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.545
FINANCIAL CONFLICTS TO THE

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:18.747
LEARNERS. UP FRONT- SO IF YOU

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:20.182
CAN I THINK DEVELOPING SUCH A

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:22.484
POLICY. TO HELP REINFORCE WHAT

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:23.819
SOUNDS LIKE MAY YOUR BOARD

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:24.853
MEMBERS RATE DOING I THINK

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.588
WOULD BE HELPFUL- KNOWING THAT

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:28.290
THERE'S GOING TO TURN OVER ON.

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:30.158
BOARDS AS WELL SO SURE SURE

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:32.327
OKAY AND THEN ONE JUST ONE

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.696
OTHER QUESTION- REGARDING CHILD

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:38.267
AND ISSUE SEVENTEEN CHILDHOOD

01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:39.735
VISION SCREENINGS. I'M A P. I

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.303
TAKE CARE CHILDREN DISOBEY-

01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.337
OBVIOUSLY VISION SCREENINGS

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.373
VERY IMPORTANT- WHILE WE'RE

01:15:44.439 --> 01:15:45.207
CLOSELY WITH OPTOMETRISTS ON

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:48.076
THAT. I ALSO WANT ALSO BE SURE

01:15:48.143 --> 01:15:49.878
WE'RE DOING EVIDENCE BASED

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:52.714
SCREENING SO WE'RE NOT- YOU.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:55.183
AND SO I THINK THAT- HOPEFULLY

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:57.419
IN ADDRESSING- CHILDHOOD VISION

01:15:57.486 --> 01:16:00.389
SCREENINGS AND AT LEAST FOR THE

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:03.025
BOARD'S ROLE IN THAT THAT-

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:04.826
YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH PEOPLE

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:08.297
IN- THE- LEARNING DISABILITIES

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:09.031
AND OTHER DISABILITIES

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.133
COMMUNITY AND WITH PHYSICIANS

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.868
AND OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:13.502
PROFESSIONALS TAKING CARE OF

01:16:13.568 --> 01:16:15.504
THESE CHILDREN. COMING UP WITH

OUR COURSE AND I WAS JUST

01:40:06.066 --> 01:40:08.736
CURIOUS. IF YOU KNOW HOW LONG

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:11.839

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:14.341
COSMETOLOGIST TO. TO RECOVER

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.110

SCHOOLS AND YET IT CAN BE

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.400
RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE I GO

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.768

THE THINGS IS I DO THINK

THERE'S MORE THAN TEN AND WE

01:42:26.573 --> 01:42:28.141
COULD GET THOSE EXACT NUMBERS

AND YOU KNOW THEY THEY ARE NOT

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.647
AS MANY AS WE WOULD HOPE TO SEE

01:42:33.714 --> 01:42:35.148
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT I

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:37.751
DO THINK I AM VERY IT'S A GREAT

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:39.286
PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE IN THOSE

01:42:39.353 --> 01:42:41.855
IN THOSE LOCATIONS. AND I THINK

01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:43.056
IT'S YOU KNOW THEY THE

01:42:43.123 --> 01:42:46.093
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE IN

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:49.530
EFFECT. LARGE AND ENROLLMENT.

AND SO IT IT DEFINITELY IS

01:42:51.398 --> 01:42:53.000
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO

01:42:53.066 --> 01:42:54.434
SEE IF MORE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:56.737

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:43.977
COSMETOLOGY FIELD IN THE STATE-

01:44:44.044 --> 01:44:47.014
BUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.782
REQUIRED FOR COSMETOLOGY.

01:44:48.849 --> 01:44:50.083
OTHERS SOME APPRENTICESHIP I

01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:52.653
GUESS ISSUES BUT THE FIFTEEN

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:54.254
HUNDRED HOURS FOR BARBERING.

01:44:54.321 --> 01:44:56.223
HOW WERE THOSE REQUIREMENTS SET

01:44:56.289 --> 01:44:58.325
I NOTICED THAT THE HOURS ARE-

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.927
EVEN IN NUMBER- WHICH IS

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.963
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL I THINK IN THE

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:08.802
EDUCATIONAL AREA. CAN SOMEONE

01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:11.271
ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. SURE I AM

01:45:11.338 --> 01:45:13.774
I THINK THE HOURS HAVE BEEN SET

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.310
MANY MANY YEARS AGO M. SIXTEEN

01:45:17.377 --> 01:45:18.278
HUNDRED HOURS IS WHAT WE HAVE

FOR. COSMETOLOGY RIGHT NOW

01:45:21.581 --> 01:45:23.116
AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN IN

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:26.086
EFFECT FOR. QUITE SOME TIME AND

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:27.220

KNOW HOW IT WAS ORIGINALLY

01:45:36.697 --> 01:45:38.031
THOUGHT OF BACK IN THE

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:40.901
BEGINNING I'M NOT POSITIVE AND-

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.402
WE HAVE DONE SOME CURRICULUM

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:44.771
REVIEW OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:47.107

01:45:52.112 --> 01:45:53.980
PRETTY CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT

01:45:54.047 --> 01:45:57.184
THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S BEEN.

01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:00.087
LOTS OF BRICK AND CHANGES OVER

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.858
AM WHICH I BELIEVE YOU KNOW IS

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.493
NOTED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.730
AND- SO AND- YOU KNOW IT'S-

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:12.966
CLOSE IN STATE THE- THE

01:46:13.033 --> 01:46:15.268
MAJORITY OF STATES RIGHT NOW-

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:17.871
RIGHT AT FIFTEEN HUNDRED. M.

01:46:17.938 --> 01:46:19.840

SIXTEEN HUNDRED. SO IT'S

01:46:24.978 --> 01:46:27.681
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT- HAS

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:30.717
BEEN IN PLACE. IN THIS-

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:35.255
INDUSTRY. FOR JUST A NUMBER OF

01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:38.425
YEARS. WELL I MEAN LOOKING AT

I'M COMPARING OCCUPATIONS

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:46.933
APPLES TO APPLES HERE BUT- IF

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.302
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COSMETOLOGY

01:46:49.369 --> 01:46:50.604
AND IF I'VE GOT THE RIGHT

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:51.471
INFORMATION LOOKING AT THE

01:46:51.538 --> 01:46:54.641
BACKGROUND. PAPER IT INDICATES

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:56.877
THAT VERMONT IN TEXAS ARE NOW

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:59.112
TO THOUSAND HOURS. IN RHODE

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:01.581
ISLAND WENT FROM FIFTEEN

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:02.149
HUNDRED HOURS TO SIX HUNDRED

01:47:02.215 --> 01:47:07.554
HOURS. IN VARIOUS MMHM. THE NEW

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:09.823
YORK HAS A LOWER REQUIREMENT

01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:10.423
THAN WE DO AND THAT SORT OF

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:13.059
UNUSUAL SO I'M I'M I'M JUST

01:47:13.126 --> 01:47:16.163
CURIOUS AS TO WHAT SORT OF A

01:47:16.229 --> 01:47:18.498
REGULAR WE'VE APPLIED TO MAKING

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:20.300
SURE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:47:20.367 --> 01:47:22.269
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED FOR THESE

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:23.870
OCCUPATIONS BARBERING

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.939
COSMETOLOGY IN THE VARIOUS

01:47:26.006 --> 01:47:28.208
CATEGORIES THAT FALL. VETERANS

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:30.777
SOCIAIS DID WITH THOSE. THAT

01:47:30.844 --> 01:47:32.646
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENT.

01:47:32.712 --> 01:47:34.181
AND THAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:47:34.247 --> 01:47:35.615
ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS AS

01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:38.952
OPPOSED TO. CONDITIONS THAT

01:47:39.019 --> 01:47:40.854
SOMEONE JUST WANTS TO IMPOSE

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:43.256
CAN YOU CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:46.960
FOR ME. ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT

01:47:47.027 --> 01:47:50.363
AND WE KNOW TEXAS MAKE THE

01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.599
CHANGE FROM FROM SIXTEEN

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:53.834
HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND AND AS

01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:55.836

THOUSAND FOR QUITE SOME TIME

01:47:57.204 --> 01:47:59.306
AND SO I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:00.807
SOMETHING THAT OUR OUR BOARD

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:03.443
MEETS CHIU M. NEEDS TO LOOK AT

01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:06.479
THEM THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED AND

01:48:06.546 --> 01:48:08.882
I THINK- WE ARE YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:10.383
MORE THAN WILLING WE KNOW THIS

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.252
IS A NATIONAL DISCUSSION THAT

01:48:12.319 --> 01:48:15.589
WE'VE BEEN HAVING AS WELL. AND

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:17.123
I DEFINITELY THINK BARBARA

01:48:17.190 --> 01:48:19.426
COURTS PREPARED TO WORK WITH

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.695
THE COMMITTEES TO DETERMINE AND

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:24.731
IF THE HOURS SHOULD BE REDUCED

01:48:24.798 --> 01:48:27.868
TO M. TO ALLOW BETTER ENTRY

01:48:27.934 --> 01:48:29.836
INTO THE INTO THE INDUSTRY. I

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:31.071
WAS TAKEN BY THE FACT THAT

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:32.806
THERE'S ONLY A ONE HUNDRED HOUR

01:48:32.873 --> 01:48:35.175
DIFFERENCE IN TRAINING REQUIRED

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:36.877
FOR BARBERS AS OPPOSED TO

01:48:36.943 --> 01:48:40.647
COSMETOLOGISTS AND WHILE I'M BY

01:48:40.714 --> 01:48:43.250
AS I UNDERSTAND WHEN I READ THE

01:48:43.316 --> 01:48:44.651
OCCUPATIONAL DESCRIPTIONS

01:48:44.718 --> 01:48:46.953
BERBERS CAN BARBERING CERTAINLY

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:50.657
INVOLVES HER COLORING. IN THE

01:48:50.724 --> 01:48:53.760
LAKE. BUT MY- PROBABLY ON. PINE

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:56.663
CERTAINLY NON PROFESSIONAL A

01:48:56.730 --> 01:48:59.065
VIEW OF IT IS COSMETOLOGY

01:48:59.132 --> 01:49:01.868
INVOLVES MUCH MORE. THAT COULD

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:03.837
INVOLVE MUCH MORE TECHNICAL

01:49:03.904 --> 01:49:06.006
ASPECTS HAVING TO DO WITH HAIR

01:49:06.072 --> 01:49:08.541
COLORING AND OTHER SORTS OF

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:10.076
TECHNIQUES THAT CHEMICAL USE

01:49:10.143 --> 01:49:13.713
THAT. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT A

01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.283
TYPICAL BARBER SHOP. AM I AM

01:49:16.349 --> 01:49:17.851
TAKEN BY THE FACT THAT THERE'S

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:19.619
ONLY A ONE HUNDRED HOUR

01:49:19.686 --> 01:49:20.186
DIFFERENCE IN THE TRAINING

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:22.222
REQUIREMENTS CAN SOMEONE

01:49:22.289 --> 01:49:25.025
ADDRESS THAT FOR ME. SURE THAT

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:26.893
THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S ONLY ONE

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:29.162
HUNDRED HOURS A COSMETOLOGIST

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:32.065
IS TRAINED TO M. NOT ONLY DO

01:49:32.132 --> 01:49:33.934
CARE SERVICES BUT ALSO DO SKIN

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.404
AND NAIL SERVICES AND SO THE

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:39.205
COSMETOLOGY LICENSES IT'S AN

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:41.608
INSTANCE OF A MASTER LICENSE

01:49:41.675 --> 01:49:43.510
AND A SENSE THAT IT. AND

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:44.644
HOWEVER AS THOSE AREAS

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.613
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BARBER%

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.082
IS AND THEY PUT ON THEIR MORE

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:51.117
COMMON TO SHAPE THEM AND

01:49:51.184 --> 01:49:54.054
PROVIDE AND THE SHAVINGS OF AND

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.659
STEP HERE FOR THE BEARD AND SO.

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:01.394
THE ONE HUNDRED HOURS AND WHY

01:50:01.461 --> 01:50:04.698
IT IS THAT DIFFERENCE- A BARBER

01:50:04.764 --> 01:50:08.068
CANNOT USE INTERNALS BUT AND

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:09.369
DOES IT HAVE THE ADDED

01:50:09.436 --> 01:50:11.237
EDUCATION FOR THE SHAPING

01:50:11.304 --> 01:50:15.041
ASPECTS SO- AGAIN IT'S ANOTHER

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:18.011
TREND AS WELL THAT WE HAVE SEEN

01:50:18.078 --> 01:50:20.180
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY THAT

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:23.483
THIS NEEDS TO BE- LOOKED AT AND

01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:24.451
I AM I DEFINITELY THINK OUR

01:50:24.517 --> 01:50:26.319
BOARD IS IN THE POSITION NOW

01:50:26.386 --> 01:50:29.789
TO. AND TO MAKE YOU KNOW SO TO

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:30.390
WORK WITH THE COMMITTEES TO

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:31.591
MAKE SOME CHANGES WELL

01:50:31.658 --> 01:50:33.093
OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY

01:50:33.159 --> 01:50:34.861
COLLEAGUES THINK ABOUT THIS BUT

01:50:34.928 --> 01:50:37.130
OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T. AN ISSUE

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:39.366
OF CONCERN TO ME BECAUSE IT MAY

01:50:39.432 --> 01:50:40.900
VERY WELL BE THAT FIFTEEN

01:50:40.967 --> 01:50:42.235
HUNDRED HOURS FOR BARBER

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:43.903
BARBERS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:45.638
HOURS FOR COSMETOLOGIST UPON

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:47.207
REVIEW APPEARS TO BE

01:50:47.273 --> 01:50:48.708
APPROPRIATE I WILL NOTE IF IN

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.944
FACT IT'S ACCURATE THAT AND I

01:50:51.011 --> 01:50:52.245
HAVE NO PROBLEM BY THE WAY WITH

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:54.047
HEALTH AND SAFETY INSTRUCTION.

01:50:54.114 --> 01:50:58.551
INSTRUCTION. ON BACTERIOLOGICAL

01:50:58.618 --> 01:51:01.121
BACK. OLOGY AND SIGNET SUBJECT

01:51:01.187 --> 01:51:02.756
LIKE THE- I'M NOT WITH THAT

01:51:02.822 --> 01:51:04.057
BEING INCLUDED BUT THE

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:05.158
BACKGROUND PAPERS SEEM TO

01:51:05.225 --> 01:51:06.459
SUGGEST THAT THAT TOTAL

01:51:06.526 --> 01:51:08.028
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY AND

01:51:08.094 --> 01:51:09.996
THIRTY HOURS OF THE FIFTEEN

01:51:10.063 --> 01:51:10.730
HUNDRED OR SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:51:10.797 --> 01:51:12.932
HOURS INVOLVED. SO I WOULD ASK

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:15.168
THAT YOU YOU BEGIN THE PROCESS

01:51:15.235 --> 01:51:18.338
RATHER QUICKLY. TO TAKE A LOOK

01:51:18.405 --> 01:51:20.373
AT THE EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:22.909
THAT WE IMPOSE. FOR THOSE WHO

01:51:22.976 --> 01:51:24.978
WISH TO SECURE LICENSURE IN THE

01:51:25.045 --> 01:51:26.946
BARBERING AND COSMETOLOGY AREA

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:29.015
HOWEVER THAT'S BROKEN DOWN. TO

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:29.983
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE ARE

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.985
REQUIRING IS A STATE IS IN FACT

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:33.953
NOT A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:36.356
BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE. THIS

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:38.425
IS AN ENTRY LEVEL OCCUPATION AN

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:39.893
OCCUPATION WHERE ONCE THEY

01:51:39.959 --> 01:51:43.863
SECURE. A LICENSE. CAN BE A

01:51:43.930 --> 01:51:45.698
MEANS TO PROVIDE A LIVING FOR

01:51:45.765 --> 01:51:46.966
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:49.102
AND IF WE'RE PUTTING OBSTACLES

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:51.004
IN FRONT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.406
IF WE ARE. IMPOSING AT

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:55.275
EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:51:55.341 --> 01:51:57.310
CARRY A COST THAT'S DIFFICULT

01:51:57.377 --> 01:51:59.979
TO PAY BACK. THAT IS COMPLETELY

01:52:00.046 --> 01:52:01.748
CONTRARY CERTAINLY TO WHAT I

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:03.283
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN AND I

01:52:03.349 --> 01:52:05.585
SUSPECT IF WE AS MY COLLEAGUES

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:06.853
IN THIS CHAMBER AND THOSE WHO

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.822
ARE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY.

01:52:08.888 --> 01:52:10.590
MANY OF THEM IF NOT MOST OR ALL

01:52:10.657 --> 01:52:13.026
OF THE MAY AGREE SO I'D LIKE TO

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:14.828
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS I PLAN TO

01:52:14.894 --> 01:52:15.628
TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDY THAT

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:17.831
WAS DONE. APPARENTLY SOME TIME

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.766
AGO TO SUPPORT THERETENTION OF

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:21.734
THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN

01:52:21.801 --> 01:52:23.703
HUNDRED OUR- A REQUIREMENT TO

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:29.375
SEE HOW RIGOROUS. PROCEDURES

01:52:29.442 --> 01:52:33.012
THAT- THAT WENT OUT OF VOGUE IN

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:34.180
NINETEEN FORTY YEAR IN NINETEEN

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:37.283
THIRTY FIVE- THE FIRST TRAINING

01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:38.718
ON CHEMICALS THAT THEY HAVEN'T

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:40.420
BEEN USED OR IN FACT MAY BE

01:52:40.487 --> 01:52:42.822
PROHIBITED. FOR THE LAST TWENTY

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.257
YEARS AND WE NEED TO REVISE OUR

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:45.625
TRAINING PROGRAM SO I'M

01:52:45.692 --> 01:52:47.894
CONFIDENT THAT YOU AND THE

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:50.096
BOARD WILL DO THAT. AND I LOOK

01:52:50.163 --> 01:52:52.232
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

01:52:52.298 --> 01:52:54.434
BECAUSE- IT'S CLEAR THAT THE

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.202
TRAINING IS NOT ALL HEALTH AND

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:58.705
SAFETY RELATED. AND IT'S

01:52:58.771 --> 01:53:01.441
PROBABLY CLEAR THE- BARBERING

01:53:01.508 --> 01:53:04.711
AND COSMETOLOGY IS NOT ANY LESS

01:53:04.777 --> 01:53:07.280
SAFE IN VERMONT TEXAS- ROME

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:10.016
ROAD ISLAND OR NEW YORK THAN IT

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.851
IS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:53:11.918 --> 01:53:13.653
AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WE DON'T

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.488
WANT IT TO BE ANY LESS SAFE

01:53:15.555 --> 01:53:18.625
YEARS SO I AM GOING TO STOP MY

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:20.593
REMARKS AT THIS TIME AND JUST

01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.530
GO BACK TO THE- RIGHT PLACE TO

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.298
MENTION ONE THING THAT. I THINK

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:26.733
UP TO LOOK AT THIS ALSO WE'RE

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:28.067
WE'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU ON

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:30.069
THAT COMPLETELY AND THE BOARD

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:32.038
IS CONCEPTUALLY PRE APPROVED

01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:34.274
RECENTLY THE MOVING TO A HAIR

01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:37.443
STYLIST ONLY LICENSED. AND

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:38.711
IT'S- SHOWING THAT WHEN WE

01:53:38.778 --> 01:53:40.680
MOVED TO THAT AREA WE CAN CUT

01:53:40.747 --> 01:53:42.248
DOWN THE AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:43.650
REQUIREMENTS IF THEY'RE ONLY

01:53:43.716 --> 01:53:45.552
INVOLVEMENT AS METROLOGY

01:53:45.618 --> 01:53:46.419

YOU ARE IN THIS AREA THAT COULD

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:52.759
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE IN

LICENSE IN THE STATE OF

01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:12.378
CALIFORNIA. AND WE SHOULD LEAN.

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.279
AWAY FROM THE WERE PUT. AND

01:54:13.346 --> 01:54:14.247
CERTAINLY WHERE WE- MAKE SURE

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:15.148
THAT THE TRAINING IN THE

01:54:15.215 --> 01:54:17.183
LICENSURE IS LIMITED INC AND

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:19.519
THEN TARGETED. TO HEALTH AND

01:54:19.586 --> 01:54:23.056
SAFETY AND PROFICIENCY- AND

01:54:23.122 --> 01:54:26.226

THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:37.837
THE COMMITTEE IS LOOKING AT

01:54:37.904 --> 01:54:38.671
THAT AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:54:38.738 --> 01:54:41.140
SCHOOLS. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ACROSS

01:54:41.207 --> 01:54:41.975
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:43.910
THE MECHANICS ELECTRONICS

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:45.178
WHATEVER IT IS IN THE BIG

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:47.213
QUESTION A WE ALWAYS HAVE IS

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:48.147
THE SCHOOL PROVIDED THE

01:54:48.214 --> 01:54:50.049
EDUCATION THAT EQUIVALENT TO

01:54:50.116 --> 01:54:52.385
THE PAY AT THE OTHER END. WHERE

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:54.287
WE FIND STUDENTS THAT ARE ARE

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:57.590
WITH DEBT THAT THE JOB IS THEIR

PAY AND- EIGHT NINE TEN DOLLARS

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:01.661
AN HOUR VERSUS THE COST OF

01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.162
HAVING A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:05.531
DEBT REMAINING IN THE SCHOOL SO

01:55:05.598 --> 01:55:07.233
THAT'S THE- AND ANGLE THAT THAT

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.668
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT AND I'M

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:09.602
HOPING THAT THE BOARD WILL LOOK

01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:12.372
AT THAT- THE MEANS. THAT SHOULD

01:55:12.438 --> 01:55:14.007
JUSTIFY THE ENDS SO

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.742

RIGHT ON AND I THANK YOU FOR

01:55:17.076 --> 01:55:19.145

YES SOME OF THESE JOBS ARE

01:55:20.546 --> 01:55:22.882
ENTRY LEVEL SOME OF THE- THE

01:55:22.949 --> 01:55:24.450
PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE

01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:26.352
FIELDS- GO OUT TO THE

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:27.854
COMMUNITIES THAT THEY REALLY

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.057
NEED HELP. AND B. AND IF THE

01:55:31.124 --> 01:55:32.692
COST IS PROHIBITIVE IN THE

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.827
INCOME IS NOT THERE THEN WE'VE

01:55:34.894 --> 01:55:36.362
GOT TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT IT

01:55:36.429 --> 01:55:38.264
AND IN KEEPING IN MIND OF

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:40.667

AND LICENSURE OF A COMMENSURATE

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.332
WITH THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN I

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:14.267
JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT-

01:56:14.334 --> 01:56:16.369
ACCORDING TO UCLA'S OF

01:56:16.436 --> 01:56:21.341
CALIFORNIA. HEALTHY NAIL SALON

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:24.010
COLLABORATIVE. AND IF- OF OUR

MAKE LESS THAN SIX DOLLARS A

01:56:25.511 --> 01:56:27.313
WEEK A MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS

01:56:29.482 --> 01:56:32.018
HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK- IN THIS

01:56:32.085 --> 01:56:33.019
IN THIS CATEGORY AND THAT'S

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:34.854
ALARMING AND THAT. JUST SHOWS

01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:36.923
THAT THE TO THE POVERTY LEVEL

01:56:36.989 --> 01:56:39.125
WAGES AND- WHAT'S PARTICULARLY

01:56:39.192 --> 01:56:42.462
CHALLENGING ALSO IS- DAY-

01:56:42.528 --> 01:56:44.230
PERCENTAGE OF NAIL SALON

01:56:44.297 --> 01:56:46.032
WORKERS. THAT ARE CONSISTING OF

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:47.166
THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER

01:56:47.233 --> 01:56:49.469
COMMUNITY MANY OF THEM WOMEN IN

01:56:49.535 --> 01:56:51.204
FACT I UNDERSTAND THAT A CO

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.239
CLOSE TO EIGHTY ONE PERCENT.

01:56:53.306 --> 01:56:55.274
ARE WOMEN WITH RESPECT TO NAIL

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:57.176
SALON WORKERS AND FOR THE ONLY

01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:58.978
ABOUT HALF OF THE WORKERS ARE

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:02.215
CONSIDERED. ENGLISH PROFICIENT.

01:57:02.281 --> 01:57:03.583
SO WITH ALL OF THESE ISSUES

01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:05.518
WITH RESPECT TO EVEN HATE AND

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.120
ALL OF THESE. OUTSTANDING

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:09.288
ISSUES THE QUESTION THEN IS

01:57:09.355 --> 01:57:10.356
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT

01:57:10.423 --> 01:57:11.691
OF OVER REGULATION AS WELL AS

01:57:11.758 --> 01:57:13.459
THEY COVERED PANDEMIC ON THE

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.561
INDUSTRY- IN MOST CASES WE'RE

01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:17.163
TALKING ABOUT ASIAN WOMEN MANY

01:57:17.230 --> 01:57:19.499
OF THEM IMMIGRANTS OR REFUGEES.

01:57:19.565 --> 01:57:21.701
AND SO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:25.938
MANY LICENSEES ARE. IDENTIFIES

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:28.408
ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER.

01:57:28.474 --> 01:57:30.443
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW IDEAL AND

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:32.412
YOU KNOW WE DON'T COLLECT THAT

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:35.114
INFORMATION. BUT I'VE BEEN I'VE

01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:37.150
BEEN WITH THE BOARD FOR SIXTEEN

01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:38.985
PLUS YEARS AND I CAN TELL YOU

01:57:39.051 --> 01:57:40.686
THAT THAT THAT NUMBER THAT YOU

01:57:40.753 --> 01:57:42.455
MENTIONED JUST PROBABLY HIGHER.

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:44.757
AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE CLOSE TO

01:57:44.824 --> 01:57:47.226
THEM A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.027
LICENSED MANICURISTS IN THE

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:50.329
STATE. M. AND I WOULD I WOULD

01:57:50.396 --> 01:57:52.432
VENTURE THAT THE PERCENTAGE

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:55.001
THAT ARE. OF ASIAN DESCENT IS

01:57:55.067 --> 01:57:57.336
HIGHER THAN THAT M. 80% IT

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.305
WOULD PROBABLY AND PUT IT MORE

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:00.273
IN THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.442
PERCENT. AND SO IT'S DEFINITELY

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:04.777
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TRIED TO

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:08.181

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:32.738
THAT EXACT DATA BUT BUT MY

BOARDS TRY TO DO EVERY TYPE OF

02:00:37.363 --> 02:00:38.531
ANALYTICS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT

02:00:38.598 --> 02:00:42.501
WE TALKED TO- R. AS WE TALK TO

02:00:42.568 --> 02:00:44.203
OUR SCHOOLS WE TALKED TO THE

STATE OUR- EDUCATIONAL PEOPLE-

02:00:46.472 --> 02:00:48.074
IN CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINISTIC

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:49.775
TESTING PROPER ALL THE

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:51.477
PROTOCOLS BEING MET. WE TALK

02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:53.613
WITH OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION

02:00:53.679 --> 02:00:55.948
ARE WHO ACTUALLY RUNS AND

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.783
MONITORS THE EXAMINATION WHAT

02:00:57.850 --> 02:00:58.918
THEIR THOUGHTS WERE WE EVEN

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.620
BROUGHT IN A COUPLE TECHNICAL

02:01:00.686 --> 02:01:03.956
PEOPLE THAT THAT ARE- STAFF

02:01:04.023 --> 02:01:08.628
STAFF THEIR AGENCY. TO TALK TO

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:09.996
OUR PORTS AND- WE WILL REALLY

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:10.997
COULDN'T FIND A REAL. THERE

02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:12.698
WERE STILL TO FIND WHY THE

02:01:12.765 --> 02:01:14.700
SPANISH- THE FAILURE RATES WERE

02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:16.535
SO HIGH BUT IN LOOKING AT

02:01:16.602 --> 02:01:19.839
ANOTHER ASPECT. OF SPECIFICALLY

02:01:19.905 --> 02:01:21.774
OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM THAT

02:01:21.841 --> 02:01:23.743
WE'RE WORKING WITH WE REVIEWED.

02:01:23.809 --> 02:01:26.012
OUR APPRENTICESHIP TRAINING AND

02:01:26.078 --> 02:01:27.213
FOUND IT TO BE. PRETTY

02:01:27.279 --> 02:01:29.582
INADEQUATE IN A LOT OF AREAS

02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:31.050
ARE THERE RECEIVING TRAINING

02:01:31.117 --> 02:01:32.518
FOR ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND

02:01:32.585 --> 02:01:33.919
TWENTY HOURS AND THE REST THEIR

02:01:33.986 --> 02:01:36.122
TIME THEY'RE WORKING AND THE

02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:39.492
ACTUAL SHOPS AND- WHICH THEY DO

02:01:39.558 --> 02:01:41.527
FOR TWO YEARS. BUT THEY HAVE TO

02:01:41.594 --> 02:01:43.329
PASS THE WRITTEN EXAMINATION AT

02:01:43.396 --> 02:01:46.165
THE END OF THIS AREA. AND THEIR

02:01:46.232 --> 02:01:47.967
EXAMINATION REYES DISAPPEARS

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:49.869
FROM ALL THE PASS RATE IS ONLY

02:01:49.935 --> 02:01:51.837
IN THE LOW THIRTIES WILL ROLL

02:01:51.904 --> 02:01:53.139
IN THE PACIFIC AND THE

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:55.174
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM SO THIS

02:01:55.241 --> 02:01:57.043
LEADS WE BELIEVE TO OUR LOW

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:58.911
STATEWIDE PASS RATE IN THIS

02:01:58.978 --> 02:02:00.379
AREA. SO WE THOUGHT BY

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.448
ATTACKING A PROBLEMS THAT WE

02:02:02.515 --> 02:02:03.382
SAW IN THE APPRENTICESHIP

02:02:03.449 --> 02:02:05.584
PROGRAM WOULD ALSO HELP RESOLVE

02:02:05.651 --> 02:02:07.420
OUR LOW PASS RATES ON SPANISH

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:09.755
LANGUAGE TESTING. SO OUR BOARD

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:11.390
IS REALLY JUST RECENTLY BROUGHT

02:02:11.457 --> 02:02:13.926
FORTH AND APPROVE OTTE'S FIFTY

TO THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

02:02:17.863 --> 02:02:19.699
THAT WOULD BETTER AMPLIFY OUR

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:21.300
NEEDS AND THEIR NEEDS FOR

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:22.101

02:02:30.443 --> 02:02:35.314
OKAY THEY GIVE VERY MUCH. ALSO

02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:36.816

02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:36.795
NUMBER OF HOURS THEY WENT THAT

02:10:36.862 --> 02:10:38.630
THE PERHAPS THE SCHOOLS WEREN'T

02:10:38.697 --> 02:10:40.098
GIVING THEM THE TUTORING

02:10:40.165 --> 02:10:42.401
BRINGING IN BILINGUAL EDUCATION

02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:44.536
PER SE. IN IN SOME WAY

02:10:44.603 --> 02:10:45.637
PREPARING THE STUDENTS TO

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:48.407
SUCCEED RATHER THAN JUST TO

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:50.309
HAVE THESE SCHOOLS- TAKE IN THE

02:10:50.375 --> 02:10:52.511
TUITION MONEY AND NOT LOOK AT

02:10:52.578 --> 02:10:54.913
THE AT THE END RESULT. AS THE

02:10:54.980 --> 02:10:57.115
CULTURE I JUST MENTIONED THAT

02:10:57.182 --> 02:10:59.885
AGAIN THE IS THE MEANS MAY NOT

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:01.253
JUSTIFY THE AND AS I SAID

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:04.356
EARLIER FINANCIALLY. AND SO IF

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:06.091
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SCHOOLS

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:07.526
THERE AND IN THE NUMBER OF

02:11:07.593 --> 02:11:09.394
HOURS REQUIRED THAT I THINK

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:10.696
THEY SHOULD ALSO LOOK INTO

02:11:10.762 --> 02:11:14.833
HAVING- INSTRUCTORS THAT ARE

02:11:14.900 --> 02:11:16.101
PROFICIENT IN BOTH LANGUAGES OR

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:17.869
WHATEVER LANGUAGE YOU MIGHT BE.

02:11:17.936 --> 02:11:20.138
TO HELP THE STUDENTS TO PASS IF

02:11:20.205 --> 02:11:21.740
THEY COULD JUST LOOK INTO THAT

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:26.411
AND- PERHAPS- IMPLEMENTED PLAN-

02:11:26.478 --> 02:11:28.347
THAT WOULD HELP BECAUSE SO MANY

02:11:28.413 --> 02:11:30.282
OF THE STUDENTS BECAUSE WE'RE

02:11:30.349 --> 02:11:31.817
TALKING ABOUT A PASSING RATE.

02:11:31.883 --> 02:11:33.752
THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:35.887
COST THAT THEY THEY'VE THEY PUT

02:11:35.954 --> 02:11:38.056
ON THE TABLE. THE AND I THINK

02:11:38.123 --> 02:11:39.591
THAT'S A SUGGESTION I'D LIKE TO

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:40.792
MAKE SURE THAT THEY TAKE A LOOK

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.794
AT. AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS

02:11:42.861 --> 02:11:44.463
DATA WE THE CULTURED MENTION

02:11:44.529 --> 02:11:45.731
DATA AND INFORMATION WITH SO

02:11:45.797 --> 02:11:47.299
MANY OTHER SCHOOLS I'D MENTION

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:49.134
THEY HAVE THAT DATA IN IT JUST

02:11:49.201 --> 02:11:51.903
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH.

02:11:51.970 --> 02:11:53.005
RECOMMENDATION I'D LIKE TO HAVE

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.040
THEM TAKE A GOOD STRONG LOOK AT

02:11:55.107 --> 02:12:00.812

TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SIXTEEN

02:13:02.274 --> 02:13:03.542
HOURS PER HAS BEEN RECONSIDERED

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:08.313

STATUTORY AUTHORITY AND TO MAKE

02:13:19.524 --> 02:13:24.196
THAT CHANGE. AND I'M SORRY I'M

02:13:24.262 --> 02:13:25.630
A FRESHMAN SENATOR WOULD YOU

02:13:25.697 --> 02:13:27.532
MIND EXPLAINING EXACTLY WHAT

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:28.133

YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT WITH

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:35.941
THE SENSE THAT PROCESS I THINK

THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:39.578
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:41.513
BOTH THE COMMITTEES AND GETTING

THAT LANGUAGE. I AM SHOULD

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.117
THERE BE IT A REDUCTION IN THE

02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:46.718
IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS WE WOULD

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:48.620
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT THROUGH

02:13:48.687 --> 02:13:49.321
THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE

02:13:49.388 --> 02:13:51.456
PROCESS IN THE BILL. AND AS A

02:13:51.523 --> 02:13:52.991
RESULT OF THIS HEARING AND THEN

KNOW POSSIBLY JANUARY. OF NEXT

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:01.466
YEAR FOR AN IMPLEMENTATION M.

02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:02.734
OF COURSE THERE WILL BE A LOT

02:14:02.801 --> 02:14:05.270
AND SHOULD THE HOURS BE REDUCED

02:14:05.337 --> 02:14:07.472
THAT WOULD BE AND YOU KNOW A

02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:09.074
PROCESS WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK

02:14:09.141 --> 02:14:11.343
THROUGH WITH SCHOOLS. AND TO

02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:13.678
DETERMINE HOW THAT COULD BE

02:14:13.745 --> 02:14:14.880
IMPLEMENTED IN WHERE STUDENTS

02:14:14.946 --> 02:14:17.516
ARE. THAT THE BY READING

02:14:17.582 --> 02:14:18.984
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOLS AM.

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:21.420
TRADITIONALLY RAN ALL THE TIME

02:14:21.486 --> 02:14:23.622
SO WE IN OUR BOARD WE DON'T

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:26.758
HAVE. A CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR

02:14:26.825 --> 02:14:27.926
WHERE WE SEE A LOT OF

02:14:27.993 --> 02:14:29.795
GRADUATION DATE THE GRADUATIONS

02:14:29.861 --> 02:14:31.730
HAPPEN ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

02:14:31.797 --> 02:14:34.232
ENROLLMENT IS FAIRLY CONTINUOUS

02:14:34.299 --> 02:14:36.501
SO. AND IT WOULD JUST TAKE THEM

02:14:36.568 --> 02:14:37.702
SOME FINESSE IT WORKING WITH

02:14:37.769 --> 02:14:39.805
THE SCHOOLS TO DETERMINE HOW TO

02:14:39.871 --> 02:14:41.206
IMPLEMENT THAT BUT WE WOULD

02:14:41.273 --> 02:14:43.241
DEFINITELY START THIS PROCESS

02:14:43.308 --> 02:14:44.409
AND IN WORKING WITH THE

02:14:44.476 --> 02:14:45.677
COMMITTEES AND THE STAFF TO

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:48.146
DETERMINE. WHAT THOSE HOURS

02:14:48.213 --> 02:14:52.350
SHOULD BE SHOULD. THERE END UP

02:14:52.417 --> 02:14:54.019
BEING A REDUCTION. THANK YOU

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:58.256
BEING GOING A LITTLE FURTHER IN

02:14:58.323 --> 02:14:59.691
CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS WHICH

02:14:59.758 --> 02:15:01.359
COMMITTEES YOU'RE REFERRING TO

02:15:01.426 --> 02:15:03.728
WOULD BEINVOLVED IN THE AN

02:15:03.795 --> 02:15:05.964
INTERESTING THIS TOPIC. WE

02:15:06.031 --> 02:15:07.199
WOULD WORK WITH THE ASSEMBLY

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:08.600
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AS

02:15:08.667 --> 02:15:09.434
WELL AS THE SENATE BUSINESS

02:15:09.501 --> 02:15:15.040
PROFESSIONS. OKAY AND THEN WE

02:15:15.106 --> 02:15:17.075
HAVE TO GO THROUGH STATUTES IN

02:15:17.142 --> 02:15:18.977
ORDER IS A BIT PASS A BILL

02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:20.612
BASICALLY TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:24.983
CORRECT. OKAY WONDERFUL- THANK

02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:30.889
EXCELLENT QUESTION MA'AM AND I

02:15:30.956 --> 02:15:33.158
GUESS. LET ME JUST ASK IT IN A

02:15:33.225 --> 02:15:34.826
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY YOU ALL

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:36.428
HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING I GUESS

02:15:36.495 --> 02:15:38.530
WITH THIS. EDUCATION

02:15:38.597 --> 02:15:40.098
REQUIREMENT AND HOW MANY HOURS

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:42.000
I THINK THERE WAS A STUDY THAT

02:15:42.067 --> 02:15:45.570
WAS DONE A FEW YEARS AGO. SO WE

02:15:45.637 --> 02:15:46.905
UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO PUT

02:15:46.972 --> 02:15:48.573
IT IN A BILL IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:50.408
CHANGE THE NUMBER OF HOURS SAID

02:15:50.475 --> 02:15:52.444
BERBERS IN BURR RIDGE TO BE IN

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:55.180
COSMETOLOGIST TO BE THE DEBATE

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.948
IN ORDER TO SECURE LICENSURE

02:15:57.015 --> 02:15:58.350
HOW LONG IS IT GOING TO TAKE

02:15:58.416 --> 02:16:00.619
YOU AND YOUR BOARD TO FIGURE

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:03.255
OUT EXACTLY HOW MANY HOURS NEED

02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:05.123
TO BE IN THE CURRICULUM FOR A

02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:07.759
BARBER OR COSMETOLOGIST OR ANY

02:16:07.826 --> 02:16:08.793
OF THE CATEGORIES THAT FIT IN

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:11.329
THERE- IN THE TWENTY FIRST

02:16:11.396 --> 02:16:16.301
CENTURY. WAIT I THINK IT. SINCE

02:16:16.368 --> 02:16:18.270
I'VE BEEN WITH THE BOARD THERE

02:16:18.336 --> 02:16:19.704
ARE MAYBE ONE RIGHT BEFORE I

02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:21.006
BECAME TO THE BOARD THEY

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:22.440
REVIEWED THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED

02:16:22.507 --> 02:16:24.476
OUR CURRICULUM AND THEN. AS YOU

02:16:24.543 --> 02:16:26.077
MENTIONED I'M JUST A FEW YEARS

02:16:26.144 --> 02:16:28.613
BACK. AND BOTH TIMES THAT THE

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:30.515
RECOMMENDATION WAS TO MAINTAIN

02:16:30.582 --> 02:16:32.684
THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS- I

02:16:32.751 --> 02:16:33.785
THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:36.488
A DIFFERENT WAY I NEED- THAT

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.356
THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED I THINK

02:16:38.423 --> 02:16:40.792
THIS IS. A NATIONAL DISCUSSION

02:16:40.859 --> 02:16:42.394
THAT'S HAPPENED I PERSONALLY

02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:44.629
HAD HAD NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ON

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:46.998
THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THAT THIS

02:16:47.065 --> 02:16:50.402
IS- SOMETHING THAT THAT NEEDS

02:16:50.468 --> 02:16:54.205
TO BE LOOKED AT IN A WAY. M.

02:16:54.272 --> 02:16:55.473
NOT SO MUCH OF HOW WE CAN

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.108
REDUCE BUT WHAT WHAT SHOULD THE

02:16:57.175 --> 02:16:58.843
HOURS BEFORE A COSMETOLOGIST SO

02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:01.246
I THINK. THE BOARD THAT M.

02:17:01.313 --> 02:17:03.281
MICHAEL MY CURRENT BOARD AND I

02:17:03.348 --> 02:17:05.150
THINK IS VERY OPEN TO THIS I

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:06.751
THINK IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING

02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:10.555
THAT- WE SEE THAT THERE NEEDS

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:12.857
TO BE A DIFFERENT LOOK AT THIS

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:15.160
AND TRYING TO DO. NOT JUST

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.795
MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO JUST

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.263
FOR THE SAKE OF. MAINTAINING

02:17:18.330 --> 02:17:19.664
THE STATUS QUO BUT REALLY LOOK

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:22.033
AT. THE RISKS INVOLVED IN THE

02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:23.301
IN THE SERVICES THAT ARE

02:17:23.368 --> 02:17:25.437
INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF

02:17:25.503 --> 02:17:27.772
PRACTICES. AND DETERMINE WHAT

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:30.542
TYPE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY M.

02:17:30.609 --> 02:17:32.444
AND WHAT TYPE OF RISKY GOES TO

02:17:32.510 --> 02:17:34.679
THE CONSUMER AND THAT SHE NEEDS

02:17:34.746 --> 02:17:36.247
TO BE OUR FOCUS FOR DEVELOPING

02:17:36.314 --> 02:17:37.983
CURRICULUM. WILL SINCE YOU WILL

02:17:38.049 --> 02:17:39.551
HAVE DONE THIS A FEW TIMES AND

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:41.519
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE FOR. A

02:17:41.586 --> 02:17:43.154
FEW YEARS- DO YOU THINK THIS

02:17:43.221 --> 02:17:45.490
ROUTE THIS REVIEW THIS INTERNAL

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:51.262
REVIEW BY YOU AND YOUR BOARD.

02:17:51.329 --> 02:17:51.830
CAN BE COMPLETED IN A YEAR.

02:17:51.896 --> 02:17:54.332
ABSOLUTELY OKAY BECAUSE THAT'LL

02:17:54.399 --> 02:17:55.700
BE VERY HELPFUL TO US IN

02:17:55.767 --> 02:17:57.769
DECIDING WHAT WE DO. IN THESE

02:17:57.836 --> 02:17:59.304
COMMITTEES WITH RESPECT TO

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:01.873
SUNSET REVIEW SO THE- REVIEW OF

02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:05.577
THE- CURRICULUM THE CURRICULA-

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:06.711
FOR THESE VARIOUS THESE

02:18:06.778 --> 02:18:09.514
OCCUPATIONS- COULD BE COMPLETED

02:18:09.581 --> 02:18:11.082
WITHIN CERTAINLY WITHIN A

02:18:11.149 --> 02:18:12.484
TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AND WE CAN

02:18:12.550 --> 02:18:14.052
HAVE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT

02:18:14.119 --> 02:18:16.054
