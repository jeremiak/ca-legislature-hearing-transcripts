BAUER-KAHAN ASSEMBLY WONDER PLEASE FEEL FREE PRESENT WHATEVER READY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. ARMCHAIR HERE TO PRESENT AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN WHICH PROHIBITS DIFFERENTIAL PRICING ON THE BASIS OF GENDER OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE PINK TAX. I WANT TO START BY TALKING ABOUT HOW HARD WOMEN HAVE BEEN HURT BY THIS PANDEMIC. THE ECONOMIC INEQUITIES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ONLY INCREASED. ALL THE NATURAL GLASSES HAVE BEEN FROM WOMEN AND SPECIFICALLY WOMEN OF COLOR. AS SHOWN IN THE DECEMBER JOB NUMBERS. THAT IS ON TOP OF THE ARTICLE PAY THAT WOMEN STRUGGLE WITH TO THIS DAY DESPITE THE VALIANT EFFORTS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WOMEN STILL MAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN MEN. AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY PAY WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PINK TAX WHICH IS PAYING MORE FOR AN IDENTICAL PRODUCT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS BEING MARKETED TO WOMEN. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WOMEN ON AVERAGE PAY TOILETRIES AND CLOTHING THEY FACE HIGHER PRICES FOR SEEMINGLY NEUTRAL PRODUCTS LIKE MORTGAGE RATES. THESE PRICE DIFFERENCES ADD UP I CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE STUDY ESTIMATED THE YEAR AFTER YEAR A TYPICAL WOMAN PAYS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE DOLLARS MORE FOR THE SAME GOODS AND SERVICES THAN HER MALE COUNTERPART. THIS ARBITRARILY PENALIZES WOMEN TO THE TUNE OF FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. K. HIGHER PRICES BECAUSE OF YOUR GENDER IS UNJUST AND FRANKLY UNLAWFUL. IT HURTS WOMEN IN A MARKET WHEN THEY ARE ALREADY DEEPLY VULNERABLE. THIS BILL STRIKES AN IMPORTANT BALANCE WE WORK HARD TO CRACK THE BILL WITH THE PROPONENTS AND THE OPPONENTS OF THE PREVIOUS ITERATIONS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THE CHAMBERS NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. AND WE ARE PROTECTED SMALL BUSINESSES FROM THE BURDENSOME LITIGATION WELL STILL HOLDING RETAILERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE SYSTEMIC GENDER IMBALANCE IN PRICING. WITH ME TODAY ARE PROFESSOR IAN ERRORS FROM YALE UNIVERSITY AND TIFFANY BOYD LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY WOMAN- IF WE COULD KINDLY ALLOW FOR A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES FOR THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. FEEL FREE 2% WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GET YOUR CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS IAN AREAS- I AND THE OSCAR AMERIHEALTH AND PROFESSOR. AND DEPUTY DEAN OF YALE LAW SCHOOL AND ALSO A PROFESSOR AT YALE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE CONDUCTED STATISTICAL TEST OF RACE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND A VARIETY OF MARKET. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE PROBLEM DIFFERENTIAL PRICING OF GOODS MARKETED TO MEN AND WOMEN AND WHY I BELIEVE AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN IS A WELL CRAFTED RESPONSE TO THIS PROBLEM. THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT NATIONAL RETAILERS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO CHARGE HIGHER PRICES ON SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SO CALLED. PINK GOODS MARKETED TO WOMEN THIS IS A LONG STANDING CONCERN IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STUDY THE ISSUE GENDER BASED PRICING OF SERVICES AN ESTIMATED THAT WOMEN PAY. A GENDER TAX OF APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AN EXTENSIVE STUDY OF GENDER PRICING IN NEW YORK CITY COMPARED THE PRICES OF. NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED PRODUCT ERRORS WITH FEMALE AND MALE ANALOGS AND FOUND THAT WOMEN'S PRODUCTS COST 7% MORE THAN- SIMILAR PRODUCTS FOR MEN. FOR EXAMPLE THE STUDY FOUND THAT CVS SOLD A PINK STOOL SOFTENER THAT COST 30% MORE THAN ITS BLUE COUNTERPARTS. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENT IN THE INGREDIENT LIST FOR THESE TABLETS. JUST THE DIFFERENT PINK PACKAGE AND A DIFFERENT PRICE NINE DOLLARS AND SEVENTY NINE CENTS VERSUS SEVEN DOLLARS AND FORTY NINE CENTS. A WELL KNOWN MARKETING STRATEGY. IS TO CREATE A WOMAN'S VERSION OF A PRODUCT BY TO PRODUCING THAT. END UP PEPTO BISMOL PINK SHADE. THE NEW YORK CITY- STUDY INCLUDED PHOTOS OF DOZENS OF PRODUCT CARE. WITH THE SHAPE SIZE INGREDIENTS WERE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL BUT JUST THE COLOR OR LABELING WAS DIFFERENT. FOR EXAMPLE IF FOUND THE TARGET SOLD THE PINK RED FLYER SCOOTER FOR WHOPPING TWENTY DOLLARS MORE THAN THE NEARLY IDENTICAL RED SCOOTER MARKETED TO BOYS. WITH A PRICE DIFFERENCE OF. FORTY FOUR NINETY NINE VERSUS TWENTY FOUR NINETY NINE. GENDERED PRICE OF THIS. SO THE DISK. OF FOUND ACROSS OF VARIETY OF I AND RE. FOR EXAMPLE WALGREENS IS FOUNDED CHARGE 23% MORE ON- IT'S WOMEN'S SHIPPED HYDRO FIVE RAZOR CARTRIDGES TARGET CHARGED URBAN OUTFITTERS CHARGES 25% MORE ON WOMEN'S. CLOTHING IN SOME INSTANCES THESE HIGHER PRICES FOR WOMEN PRODUCTS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED BY DIFFERENT ARE DIFFERENTIALLY HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS FOR EXAMPLE THE TOP DETAILING A WOMAN'S BLOUSE. MIGHT MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE CAUGHT THE KILLER IN THE SIMILAR MEN SURE. BUT AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN EXPLICITLY RESPONSE TO THIS CONCERN BY NOT PROHIBITING PRICE DIFFERENCES THAT ARE BASED ON THE DIFFICULTY OR COST OF MANUFACTURING. THAT THE DIFFERENT PRICES CHARGED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT ARE EXPLICITLY MARKETED TO DIFFERENT GENDERS DISPROPORTIONATELY HURTS WOMEN. CHARGING THAT HIGH THAT THE MARKET WILL BEAR IS NOT A BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS THIS PROGRAM PACKED. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN APPROPRIATELY RESPOND TO THE RAMPANT PROBLEM OF GENDER PRICING WERE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS- PRICES ARE CHARGED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND- OF WE'VE- THE THREE MINUTES BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL PRIMARY WIN THIS AND SO- IF IT I BELIEVE IT'S- THIS BOY OUT FROM THE COMMISSION ON STATUS OF WOMEN. AND GIRLS. GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TIFFANY BOYD AS MENTIONED I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS. THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON STATUS WOMEN GIRLS THERE THAT THE INDEPENDENT ADVISORY AGENCY. TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OF POLICY AND OTHER ISSUES PERTAINING TO THE SYSTEMIC CONDITION. AFFECTING EQUITY ON WOMEN AND GIRLS IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION FORWARD WE KNOW THAT WOMEN AND GIRLS CONTINUE TO FACE AN ARRAY OF ANY QUALITIES IN MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR DAILY LIVES. MANY HAVE WHICH HAVE BEEN WORSENED BY THE COBIT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ONE SIGNIFICANT AND SYSTEMIC BARRIER TO EQUAL ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN. IS THE PINK TAX AND AS MENTIONED IT IS A SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. TO HAVE THIS GENDER BASED PRICING DISPARITY. AS MENTIONED IT WITH ROUGHLY FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR- COSTS WOMEN ACROSS CALIFORNIA IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE STILL ASSIGNED THE BURDEN OF PAYING MORE FOR SIMILAR GOODS. THAN MEN. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ACTED IN RESPECT TO GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. AND THE SCALE OF SERVICES SUCH AS HAIRCUTS DRY CLEANING. AND ALTERATIONS OVER A QUARTER CENTURY AGO IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. I'M GOING PRICES IN PARTICULARLY. I BETWEEN PRESS HEALTH. SPORTS EQUIPMENT AND TOYS. ARE CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT CONSUMER PRESSURE IN EXISTING LAWS ARE INSUFFICIENT AND WE NEED A LEGAL GUARANTEE. OF THIS PARTICULAR EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. TOLERATING DISCRIMINATORY PRICE SETTING REINFORCES SOCIETAL SIGNALS ABOUT THE VALUE OF GENDER WHERE WOMEN ARE. VALUED AND WHERE THEY ARE NOT WOMEN ALREADY PAID LESS THAN MEN AND WITH THE P. TAX OR CHARGE MORE ON TOP OF IT. AB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO EQUAL TREATMENT BY ENDING GENDER BASED PRICING. SAFEGUARDING THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OF WOMEN IS NOT JUST ABOUT WOMEN. ABOUT ABOUT THE PROSPERITY OF CHILDREN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ELIMINATING TAXES A COMMON SENSE ACTION TO GET US ONE STEP CLOSER TO ACHIEVING FULL EQUALITY.

IN ORDER TO BRING DISPARITIES AND NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES TO AN AND SPECIFICALLY AB FORTINO SEVEN REQUIRES NURSING PROGRAMS AND HOSPITALS TO INCLUDE IN HIS IMPLICIT BIAS EDUCATION FOR NURSES EVIDENCE EXISTS THAT SUGGESTS THE PRESENCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM LEADS TO DIFFERENT SETS IN QUALITY OF CARE GIVEN TO PATIENTS AND THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES THE SAME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MORE OFTEN THAN NOT PEOPLE OF COLOR AND WOMEN ARE THE ONES TO BE NECK LIVES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY THIS IMPACT. IN A HEALTHCARE SETTING DECISIONS AFFECTED BY BIAS CAN HAVE LIFE AND DEATH IMPLICATIONS AT MATH AS IT MANIFESTS ITSELF IN SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN HOW HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. INTERACT WITH PATIENTS THE DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH CARE TREATMENTS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND MUST BE ADDRESSED. WE KNOW THAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REDUCE IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND THERE IS A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT BY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND EDUCATORS FOR MITIGATING NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THOSE EFFORTS MUST CONTINUE IF WE'RE TO MAKE STRIDES TOWARD ADDRESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR STATE MANY DIVERSE POPULATIONS. AB FORTINO SEVEN WILL BROADEN THOSE EFFORT TO BRING AWARENESS.

HOWEVER WHEN INPUT DEVICE CHRIS THIS MAY HEALTHCARE SPENDING IT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE HEALTH CARE DISPARITIES EXPERIENCED BY MEMBERS OF RACIAL ETHNIC. OR RELIGIOUS MINORITIES AND OTHER GROUPS. THE PREVALENCE OF IMPLICIT BIAS IN THE HEALTHCARE SETTING IS REFLECTIVE OF BEING ADDED WE- ENACTED SCENES YOU NEED. WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND STRUCTURE. TOO OFTEN THE BUILDINGS BUILT TO LOOK AT COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. THOSE COMMUNITIES NEEDS AND RESOURCES- THE THIRTY NEED TO TAPPED. FILL THOSE NEEDS. OF CHARACTER EVEN EDUCATORS MUST DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO ENDING RACIAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. AND WORKING TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY BY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING STRATEGIES THAT ELIMINATE IMPLICIT BIAS WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AB FOURTEEN OH SEVEN RECOGNIZES THAT AWARENESS AND EDUCATION IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD ELIMINATING. THE BIAS IN THIS SETTING. EDUCATING THE FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE SO THAT THEY ARE COGNITIVE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF IMPLICIT BIAS THE PATIENTS THEY SERVE. IS PARAMOUNT. TO BRING THIS PHENOMENON TO AN END.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL TEN EIGHTY FOUR. TO REQUIRE RETAILERS WITH FIVE HUNDRED OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO PROVIDE A GENDER NEUTRAL RETAIL SECTION OF FOUR CHILDREN'S ITEMS IF THE RETAILER CHOOSES TO SIMPLY LABEL TOYS OUR KIDS. THAT IS ALSO THE OPTION AS WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY RETAILERS WHO ARE ALREADY GOING INTO SPACE. NAMELY COMPANIES LIKE TARGET MADE HEADLINES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN MINUTE DECIDED TO GO AWAY WITH GENDER BASED SIGNS TO ENSURE THAT KIDS CAN BE KIDS. WHY SHOULD A GIRL WHO WISHES TO WEYRICH TEACHER WITH A DINOSAUR ON IT. HAVE TO BE SHAMED AND FACE STIGMA GOING TO THE BOYS SECTION SIMPLY PUT LET'S LET KIDS BE KIDS AS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALSO GONE IN THIS DIRECTION. A PREVIOUS YEARS UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SOME OF THESE NUMBERS HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ON GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOMS AS WELL- SO WE HOPE TO CONTINUE ON THE INCLUSIVITY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH WITH WITH ME TODAY ARE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OF FIRST OFF. WE HAVE ROB SMITH WHO BEGAN HIS LONG CAREER SPANNING OVER THIRTY YEARS GAINING NEW EXPERIENCES. AS THE CHILDREN'S GLOBAL CHIEF PRODUCT OF OFFICER FOR NIKE LEVI'S JORDAN HURLEY AND CONVERSE- TODAY ROB LEADS AND MANAGES THE FOOD PROJECT LEADER IN GENDER FREE FASHION.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCHER FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT. WHO'S WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FIRST. ROB PLEASE IF YOU DON'T MIND. YOU'VE GOT IT- THANK YOU ALL FOR- INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL- PRETTY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT OBVIOUSLY THROUGH MY CAREER THIRTY YEARS AND RETAIL AND BEFORE BY THE WAY BEFORE LEVI'S AND NIKE I WORKED FOR MACY'S FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS SO I UNDERSTAND. DEEPLY THE- THE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND RETAIL- BUT ALSO THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT LAWS CAN BE CREATED TO SUPPORT- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OFTEN LIVE- WE'RE LIVE IN THE MARGINS. OF OUR SOCIETY AND CALIFORNIA'S DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB AND AS WITH THE GOVERNMENT HAS CONTINUED TO DO TO CREATE. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SPACE. BEYOND THE BINARY AND UNIVERSIDAD THAT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE A BOY WHAT IS YOUR GIRL JUST WANNA LET EVERYONE KNOW I VISITED- KIDS DEPARTMENT THE OTHER DAY. AND IN IN JUST JUSTICE GIVE ME AN IDEA FOR AS A BUSINESS PERSON AS A CONSULTANT ALSO FOR LOTS OF RETAILERS. THE GIRL DEPARTMENT READ. FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS SMILE STAY HAPPY BE YOU LOVE IS THE WAY TO BE COOL BE KIND. THE BOYS DEPARTMENT READ LEGEND YOUR ATTIC FUTURE HERO. MAKE THAT MAKE THE WOULD MAKE TODAY COUNT WORLDWIDE VISION DUDE. SO THIS MESSAGING WE'RE SENDING IS VERY- IS SUPPRESSIVE. AND REALLY BUILD IN THIS IDEA OF WHAT IT IS W THINK OF IS TO BE APPOINTED THE GIRL AND MORE MORE NO PARENTS ARE BEGINNING TO RAISE THEIR KIDS WITHOUT THESE. IDEAS AND WE'RE ALREADY DOING IT RIGHT NOW I'M SPEAKING WITH LARGE AND CONSULTING WITH LARGE COMPANIES HOW TO CREATE THIS SPACE IN BETWEEN. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT FORCES THE CONVERSATION IT DOESN'T ALLOW. COMPANIES TO DRAG THEIR FEET ANYMORE. AND ALLOWS FOR A SPACE IN BETWEEN FOR FOLKS WHO IDENTIFIER THERE'S IS NOT BINARY OR THEIR SELF EXPRESSIVE AND- THE OPPORTUNITY JUST LIKE KIDS THE KIDS YOU KNOW KIDS ALL HAVE THE SAME BODY SHAPES. YOU KNOW AND LET MY KIDS BE KIDS AND THIS LAW WOULD START TO FORCE IN THE WAKE UP LEADERS AND RETAILERS. TO CREATE THE SPACE BETWEEN- AND I LIKE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS DOESN'T HURT ANYBODY THEY'LL STILL BE BLUE SECTIONS OF PINK SECTIONS IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT FOR YOUR KIDS. BUT IT DOES ALLOW FOR THAT KID IN THE MIDDLE TO CREATE INTO SHOP ON THEIR BEHALF AND AS A RETAILER YOU CAN LITERALLY TAKE DOWN ALL YOUR SIGNS RIGHT NOW BOYS AND GIRLS. WE ONE MASSIVE GENDER NEUTRAL KIDS DEPARTMENT- THIS IS JUST A SMALL MUCH SMALLER SALT. SO I AM FULLY SUPPORTIVE AND- AND I COULD SPEAK ON BEHALF OF A BEING WORKING FOR BIG COMPANIES. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THIS HELPS PAVE. THE WAY AND MOVING A LOT FASTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH NOT WHAT IN SUPPORT.

SURE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK VERY MUCH ANYONE IN SUPPORT IN THE CHAMBER. SCENE NINE. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION STOPPARD WE OPEN IT UP FOR OPPOSITION FOR TEN EIGHTY FOUR. FOR THOSE WHO HEAR ME SPEAK. PARDON ME THERE SEEMS TO BE A WITNESS MISTER CHAIR. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION FIRST WITNESS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE. THANK YOU MEMBERS MY NAME IS GREG BIRD WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL AND WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL- IN REMOVING IT YOUR BAN ON SEPARATING AT CHILDREN'S CLOTHES AND TOYS BY SEX BUT WE ARE STILL OBJECTING. TO THE STATE DICTATING TO RETAIL STORES HOW TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS FIRST OFF THE BILL IS CONFUSING AND IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLY WITH. THE BILL REQUIRED THE RETAIL STORE TO CREATE GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION WHERE EIGHT REASONABLE NUMBER OF ITEMS ARE PLACED. BUT THE WORD THE BILL DOES NOT DEFINE THE WORD REASONABLE NOR DOES IT EXPLAIN WHAT ITEMS SHOULD BE PUT IN THE GENDER NEUTRAL SECTION. IN PARTICULAR ITEM ISN'T. WHAT THAT GIVES SOME CHILD OR ACTIVISTS THE REASON TO COMPLAIN. WHO'S GONNA RESOLVE THE DISPUTE. IF THE BUREAUCRAT LAWYERS JUDGES NO STORE WILL EVER BE EVER KNOW FOR SURE IF THEY'RE COMPLYING. A BILL LIKE THIS OPEN THE DOOR TO A NEVER ENDING NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM ACTIVIST GROUPS WHO DON'T LIKE THE WAY STORES ARE MARKETING THE PRODUCT. TO ONE SEX OR ANOTHER. RETAIL STORE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO DECIDE HOW BEST TO MARKET THE PRODUCT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS BASED ON WHAT MARKET RESEARCH TELL THEM THE CUSTOMER'S ONE. IT WILL NOT BE PERFECT AND THEY'LL GET IT WRONG SOMETIMES. BUT WHEN THEY GET IT WRONG THEIR PRODUCTS WILL NOT SELL THE MARKET WILL DO A BETTER JOB OF MEETING PUBLIC NEEDS THEN YOUR WALL WILL. END TOMORROW CHRISTINE THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO FREE EXPRESSION LIFEGUARDS NO ONE INDIVIDUAL OR LEGISLATOR HAS THE RIGHT TO TELL A COMPANY OWNER. WHAT MESSAGES ABOUT GENDER THEY CAN USE TO SELL THE PRODUCT. STATE LEGISLATORS NEED TO STOP FORCING THEIR PERSONAL OPINIONS ON THOSE THEY DISAGREE WITH. THIS IS AN ILLEGAL USE OF THEIR POWER. LEGISLATOR SHOULD RESPECT THE VIEWS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND TRIED TO PERSUADE THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS IF THEY THINK THEY'RE WRONG. INSTEAD OF USING THE LEGISLATIVE POWER TO FORCE THEIR VIEWS ON OTHER. ISN'T SIMPLY OBNOXIOUS. IT'S A VIOLATION OF FREE SPEECH AND IT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG. THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL STRONGLY OPPOSES AB ONE EIGHTY FOUR ENCOURAGES THE COMMITTEE TO REJECT THE BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR. NEXT WITNESS. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS IS MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY ON BEHALF OF THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY- IN OPPOSITION AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR WE SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE ON DISTILLATE OUT SOME OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS- I HOPE THAT YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT- SO I WON'T REPEAT THAT WILL JUST TOUCH ON A FEW THINGS REAL QUICKLY. THE FIRST OF ALL I THINK IT'S TELLING THAT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- DID NOT DEAL WITH OUR FIRST AMENDMENT AND OTHER COCERNS RELATED TO THE BILL AT ALL INSTEAD- STATING WEAKER ARGUMENTS OFFERED BY OTHER GROUPS IN OPPOSITION. AS PRIMARILY THE BILL CONTINUES TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. RELATED TO CONTENT IN VIEWPOINT- DISCRIMINATION AND MANDATES OUR SAILORS THERE'S ALSO SIGNIFICANT. AMBIGUITY PROBLEM. AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WOULD NOTE POINTED COMMITTEE TO BROWN VERSUS ENTERTAINMENT MERCHANTS ASSOCIATION FOR THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN AB ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHICH WAS BASED ON A VERY SIMILAR PREMISE THE NOTION THAT PARENTS NEED HELP IN ORDER TO SELECT APPROPRIATE TOYS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. PARENTS NEED A LOT OF HELP IN THE STATE BUT THEY DON'T NEED POLITICIANS. TELLING THEM HOW THEY SHOULD SELECT TOYS FOR THEIR CHILDREN AS WE TALK TO OUR CONSTITUENTS ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION THE DOMINANT RESPONSE IS THIS BELIEF. THAT IN A TIME OF GLOBAL CRISIS THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE LEGISLATORS ARE SPENDING THEIR- THEIR TIME IN OUR TAXPAYERS MONEY DEBATING IS THE WRONG TIME THE WRONG APPROACH IN THE TWENTY ANALYSIS MAKES IT MORE CLEAR THAN EVER. THAT THIS IS HEAVILY IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINE JUST NAME AN ORGANIZATION ONLY PLEASE.
