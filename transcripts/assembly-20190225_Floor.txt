MY CONSTITUENTS AND COMMUNITY ACTIVISTS LAUREN BUSAN FROM THE FIFTY FIRST AND I CONNECTED WHEN WE MET AT OUR DISTRICTS COFFEE MEETING IN ECHO PARK LAST OCTOBER. SHE HAS MADE IT HER MISSION. TO RECOGNIZE BEAR RESIDENTS LEGACY THROUGH A U. S. POSTAGE STAMP CAMPAIGN. BEAR RESIDENTS NAME IS LARGELY VACANT FROM OUR HISTORY BOOKS. BUT HE MERITS PROPER RECOGNITION. HE WAS AN UNSUNG HERO OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT WHO FOUGHT FOR RACIAL JUSTICE. AN LGBT Q. VISIBILITY. IN ATIME. WHICH THAT WAS NOT VERY POPULAR. BORN IN NINETEEN TWELVE HE WAS A LIFELONG BELIEVER IN CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. AND THE TEACHINGS OF MOHAMMED GANDHI. WHICH LATER BECAME A FIXTURE OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. DURING THE NINETEEN FIFTIES HE BECAME A CLOSE ADVISER AND FRIEND. TO DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR INTRODUCING DR KING. TO GANDHI'S TEACHINGS. RUSTIN THEN BECAME THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON IN. NINETEEN SIXTY THREE AND HE WAS PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON THE JOB TO FREEDOM PIPELINE. RUSTIN READ THE TEN GOALS ON THE STEPS OF THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL IN FRONT OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AT THE MARCH. THESE GOALS INCLUDING. INCLUDED THE SEGREGATING ALL SCHOOLS. BANNING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. AN INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE ALL ISSUES WHICH CONTINUE TO BE PREVAIL AND TO THIS GOVERNING BODY. BEAR RUSTIN WAS AHEAD OF HIS TIME BY CHAMPIONING LABOR EQUITY AN ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO BE PRESENT IN OUR SOCIETY. AND AN ISSUE THAT I AND MANY MANY OF US WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. THE FIGHT FOR JUSTICE MUST CONTINUE IF WE ARE TO TRULY HONOR THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US. AUSTIN IS A FIGURE WHO REMAIN WHO RESEMBLES MANY PEOPLE FROM MY DISTRICT IN ACROSS THE STATE WHO FACE COMPOUNDING DISCRIMINATION DUE TO THEIR RACE. AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION. IT IS FITTING. THAT DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD RECOGNIZE HIS TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND THE FIRST CALL BE OPEN FOR ROLL CALL. THANK YOU MISS CREE OF DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. AYE TO RISE A DAY IN SUPPORT OF A C. R. TWENTY SEVEN AND THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IS PROUD PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE BAY RUSTIN. AS A TRUE CIVIL RIGHTS HERO AND A FIGHTER FOR JUSTICE. YOU PROBABLY CAN READ ABOUT THE BY -- OF OF OF RUSTIN IN TERMS OF HIS EDUCATION HIS FAMILY WAS WELL KNOWN HE BASICALLY ATTENDED WILBERFORCE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS CHENEY STATE UNIVERSITY TO BLACK COLLEGES. WAS VERY SHARP VERY SMART. YOU SHOULD REMEMBER HIM AS A MAN WHO TRULY BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS. THE TALK ABOUT EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN ACCESS. BAYARD RUSTIN PUT HIMSELF ALWAYS ON THE LINE FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY. EVEN AS A STUDENT WILBERFORCE. HE BASICALLY WAS KICKED OUT OF WILBERFORCE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE HE ORGANIZED A PROTEST AND A STRIKE AT THIS COLLEGE. HE TALKED ABOUT JUSTICE AND EQUALITY EVERYWHERE HE WENT. HE ACTUALLY SPENT TWO YEARS IN PRISON BECAUSE HE WAS A CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTOR TO WORLD WAR. TWO HE WAS A MAN WHO WAS A PACIFIST WHO BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES OF GANDHI NOT JUST IN SOME ABSTRACT SENSE WITHIN A REAL PRACTICAL SINCE. HE BELIEVED IN EQUALITY OF EVERYONE. HE WAS A GAY AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO FUNCTION NOT ONLY IN THE LARGER SOCIETY BUT EVEN WITHIN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES AND FORTIES IN WHICH SHE LIVED. YET DESPITE THAT HE BECAME A BELOVED FRIEND. OF THURGOOD MARSHALL AND SO MANY OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS LEADERS. BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT HE WAS TRULY AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A PERSON TOTALLY COMMITTED TOOK EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR EVERYONE. IT IS UNFORTUNATE BAYARD RUSTIN OFTEN WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF MOVEMENTS WHETHER IT WAS THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON OR VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF PROTEST. HE'S STILL AT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WASN'T AFRAID TO TELL YOU WHO HE WAS. BUT HE RECOGNIZE IT PROBABLY HIS PRESENCE IN A VERY VISIBLE SENSE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MARCH HAD AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE MOVEMENT. AND SO HE VOLUNTARILY STEPPED THIS TO TAKE THE FRONT SEAT WHILE HE WORKED BEHIND THE SCENES. HE IS TRULY A HERO IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD HAVING SACRIFICE AND SUFFERED THROUGH MANY OF THE PROTEST THAT EXISTED IN THIS COUNTRY. HE DIED IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS A PERSON WHO AT THE AGE OF SEVENTY FIVE AND THE NEW YORK TIMES TALKED ABOUT LOOKING BACK AT A BAD RUSTIN AS A QUAKER. AND THEY SAID THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS WHICH INFLUENCE HIS LIFE WAS NONVIOLENT TACTICS CONSTITUTIONAL MEANS DEMOCRATIC PROCEDURES RESPECT FOR HUMAN PERSONALITY AND A BELIEF THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE. ONE WE HAVE VERY FEW PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE KIND OF SACRIFICE THAT BARED RUSTIN DID WITHOUT DEMANDING ATTENTION WITHOUT DEMANDING THAT THINGS HAD TO BE A REFLECTION OF HIM. BUT OPENING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS WE BRACES RESOLUTION WE ALSO ASKED THAT WE ALSO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THE THE MOVEMENT THAT IS BEING DESIGNED TO GET A STAMP IN HIS HONOR. THAT IT WILL MEAN A LOT FOR ALL FOR THE MOVEMENT ITSELF AND FOR THE DIVERSITY OF THIS COUNTRY TO NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY IN TERMS OF RACE. BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF SEXUALITY. WE'RE VERY ANA TODAY TO BE A PART OF THIS I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES TO BRING THIS RESOLUTION FOR IT AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR ACR.

T. EQUALITY. AND ALTHOUGH HIS WORK PUT HIM ON THE AS A PROLIFIC ORGANIZER ON THE ON THE STATURE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING MAHATMA GANDHI HE WAS PUSHED TO THE BACK BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO LIVE HIS LIFE IN THE SHADOWS. HE REFUSED TO LIVE IN THE BACKGROUND -- TO BE ABLE TO DO HIS WORK HE COULD DO HIS WORK WITHOUT GETTING ALL THE CREDIT -- HE DARED TO LIVE OUT LOUD WHEN IT WAS BOTH ILLEGAL TO HAVE FULL RIGHTS AS A AFRICAN AMERICAN AND WHEN IT WAS OKAY TO BE DIAGNOSED AS MENTALLY ILL. FOR BEING A HOMOSEXUAL -- AS A YOUNG MAN HE SAW HIS DUTY TO MULTIPLE TIME HE WOULD NOT AND A BET. BY LIVING IN A HE LIVED HIS TERMS. TO COMBAT PREJUDICE. IN ITS AGE TRULY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN ALL LOOK FORWARD TO DO AS HE RAISED HIS VOICE FOR DIGNITY. FOR L. G. B. T. FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR EVERYTHING THAT HE STOOD -- FOR IT WAS FOR DIGNITY OF ALL AND LET US ALL THINK MEMBERS AS WE WERE FORWARD IN OUR WORK -- WHETHER IT'S END OF LIFE WORK WHETHER IT'S AROUND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHETHER IT'S AROUND ADDICTIONS THE BEST WE CAN EVER DO IS TO LIVE IN THE AY THAT WE PROVIDE AS TOO MUCH DIGNITY.
