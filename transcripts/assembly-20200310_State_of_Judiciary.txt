JUSTICE MING CHIN IS A JUROR WITHOUT PARALLEL HIT TWENTY FIVE YOU WISE AND PRACTICAL JURISPRUDENCE ON THE CALIFORNIA COURT WILL. EIGHT TO COME. ONE IS LIKE AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF WHO WE- DONE BUT I ACTUALLY KNEW BEFORE I MET HIM AND I'LL TELL ABOUT THAT IN A FEW MOMENTS. HERE IN NOW. THIS LEGISLATURE YOU GRAPPLE WITH THE STATE'S MOST VITAL ISSUES FROM HOMELESSNESS TO THE ENVIRONMENT. TO HEALTHCARE TO EDUCATION TO OUR AGING POPULATION AS WELL AS FUNDING OF LITIGATION THREATS FROM OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT UNDERMINE BILITY TO DRESS THESE USE. ALSO WE MET LAST YEAR ALONE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S BILLS RESPOND AT ALL. THESE LOGS WERE THE PRODUCT OF DELIBERATION DISCUSSION AND DEBATE RIGHTLY IMPROPERLY YOU HELP YOURSELVES THE BALL. HELD OTHERS ACCOUNTABLE. NOW IT STATES THAT DOES NOT SOONER OR LATER BECOME A JUDICIAL ONE. SO YOUR ISSUE GIVE IT TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND WE BECOME ACCOUNTABLE. ACCOUNTABLE OF COURSE WITH OUR FAIR AND IMPARTIAL PUBLIC HEARINGS WE RELY ON THE FACTS TO MAKE FINDINGS OF FACT AND OF COURSE THE RULE OF LAW. BUT ALSO WHAT WILL AN A.'S BECAUSE- THIS IN THE NAME OF AND WE DO IT UNDER THE BANNER OF THREE DIMENSIONAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT IS THAT IT IS B. E. ALL THAT IT PHYS AND IT BE. TAKE FOR A COUPLE TIME IN IT GRANT FUNDING TO THE JUDICIAL QUE. WE DO. THAT TRIAL COURTS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE EQUAL AT. IN THE RESTRICTIONS. SOME OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDE A HUMAN TRAFFICKING PREVENTION COURT IN FRESNO THAT PROVIDES A PLACE FOR VICTIMS TO COME FOR SUPPORT SAFETY AND SOCIAL SERVICES. IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY DEVELOP A VETERANS COURT THAT SEEKS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ENTREAT AND IN WOMEN WHO SERVE THIS COUNTRY BUT HELP LOST WAY WHEN THEY CAME HOME. UNDER THE BANNER. FULL ACCESS TO JUSTICE WITH THE HEALTH. TO REPAIR MAINTAIN OUR OVER FIVE HUNDRED COURT FACILITIES AS WELL AS BUILD NEW BUILDINGS IN CRITICAL AREAS AS YOU KNOW. UNDER THE BANNER OF ONLINE ACCESS TO JUSTICE WE'VE HELPED BUTTE COUNTY AND RURAL COURT USERS WHO COME TO COURT OR WHO NEED SELF HELP. AND SO THIS GUY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND RURAL HELP THE TWENTIETH OTHER JURORS. AND IT HEY WE LEAD TO A MOBILE APP THAT PERMITS TO THOSE YOU TO ACT COURT CASES IN CALENDAR. AND PAID. ASSESSED AND WITH A FAST AND ALSO THE CONSEQUENCES OF GOVERNMENT ACTION NEGLECT AND MISSTEPS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE ANY OF US WERE HERE. BUT IN RECENT TIMES ALL OF US HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT RACIAL AND INCOME INEQUALITY CAN OFTEN CREATE BARRIERS TO ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND AFFECTS THE DEMOCRACY. OF ASK EXPERIENCES SO FOR EXAMPLE IN CALIFORNIA WE HI IS RATE IN THE NATION. IN CAPS YEAH WE HAVE OVER FIFTY CENT OF THE NAME. ASIAN STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES TO IDENTIFY AND REFORM SYSTEMS OF INEQUITY. DURING MY ADMINISTRATION HE HAD CHAMP THE NEED OF IMPOVERISHED AND THE OVERLOOKED WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND WORKED ON MANY PROGRAMS INCLUDING WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON LEGAL. ON THE TRACK. IT PLAYED YOUR BROTHER. IS WITH THE P. WAS TO RESTORE. WE HAVE IN FACT DEVELOP PRE TRIAL SERVICES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MONEY BAIL THAT PREYS UPON MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THE POOREST OF THE POOR. WE HAVE PILOTED FINE AND FEE REFORMS IN ORDER TO RESTORE FAIRNESS AND BALANCE AND PUT ANALOGY TELL WHEN COME CALIFORNIA. WE CONTINUE TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FOR OUR DEPENDENT CHILDREN AND ARE WORKING TO REPRESENT THEM. IN DELIVER NEWS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED SELF HELP AND FOR PEOPLE THANK YOU JUST AS QUICKLY ARE WHO ARE UNABLE TO STAND ENGLISH AS WELL AS THEY NEED TO BE FOR COURT SERVICES. WE DO ALL THIS AND WE ASK THEN FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT IN OUR BUDGET SO WE CAN CONTINUE THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A NEW ONE. THE COURT NAVIGATOR PROGRAM THE COURT NAVIGATOR PROGRAM IS A HUMAN TOUCH FOR PEOPLE WHO COME TO COURT WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY AND ARE IN CRISIS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRANCH OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU WILL COME TO READ IT AS AS I HAVE. THAT WOULD COME ON BOARD A THAT RESOLVES. WE TIMES FIRST JUST AS- AN AS CHIEF JUDGE. I HAVE GONE OUT OF MY CONSCIENCE DEMANDED IT. ON MATTERS CONCERNING FINES AND FEES. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND MISCONDUCT AND UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IN THE JUDICIARY. AND FIT ALL IMMIGRATION INTERFERENCE AND UPSTAGED THE SYSTEM. THIS IS WHY IN PART I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE BECOME SOCIAL JUSTICE CENTERS. I OFTEN SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A CRISIS THAT COULD LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS I WILL BE APPOINTING A WORKGROUP THE HOW WE CAN BECOME PARTNERS IN THE CRISIS OF HOMELESS. AND THIS WORK. THIS WORK GROUP WILL REPORT BACK TO ME AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND WILL CONSIDER QUESTIONS LIGHT. HOW COURTS BECOME MORE PROACTIVE IN ADDRESSING HOME POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THERE TOOLS AND FEATURES IN LAWS THAT NEED TO BE A MAN OR MY- WE BET FIRST. THE POP. THAT COME TO OUR THAT'S- WE FOR ARE STILL PROPERTY. AND IT REPURPOSED FOR. IS THERE A WAY FOR EXAMPLE CAN USE OUR ASSIGNED TO PRO FOR TARGET SERVICE SO THAT COURTS CAN USE THEM FOR IT IS FOR PEOPLE ARE IN CRISIS. WANT TO TELL YOU THAT I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THE JUSTICE WE DO TODAY WILL AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES OF TOMORROW. AND THAT IS WHY I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT IT IS I KNEW OF CHESTER'S CHICKEN IN OUR HIS NAME AT THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S WHAT I'M I KNEW HIM BEFORE. MET HIM. RECENTLY ASKED ABOUT WHICH OPINIONS OR DECISIONS HE WAS MOST PROUD AND HE CITED A DESCENT FROM WHEN HE WAS A COURT OF JUSTICE AND IN THE DISSENT ARGUED THAT WOMEN'S IN ROME BE A LITTLE DEFENSE IN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROP YOU SHOULD. BUT OF COURSE HE WITH THE DISSENT ON THE COURT OF APPEAL. SO BUT WHEN HE BEAT HIM AS A CREAM COURT JUSTICE AUTHORED AN OPINION FOR THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZING BATTERED WOMEN'S SYNDROME AS A DEFENSE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES. THAT WAS THE NINETY. IN NINETEEN SEVEN I'M CREATING THE FIRST EVER DEMAIS VIA. IN WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A MY COLLAB COURT ORDER OF JUSTICE BECAUSE- AN- JUST DECISION RECOGNIZING WOMEN SYNDROME IS GROUNDBREAKING. BECAUSE IT FINALLY ALLOWS US TO UNDERSTAND THE PATH OLOGY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND ALSO EFFECT NOT ONLY ON THE VICTIM AND NOT ONLY ON CHILDREN OR THE FAMILY. BUT ON FUTURE GENERATIONS IT CHANGED THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE FOREVER. LOUDEST A WINDOW OF TERRIFYING WINDOW INTO THE T. R. THE LIFE OF THE VICTIM. SO I SAY THANK YOU JUST CHIN FOR YOUR PUBLIC SERVICE YOUR VISIONARY LEADERSHIP BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT YOU DEMONSTRATE THAT WHEN WE ARE OPEN MINDED WHEN WE DO OPERATE FAIRLY AND WHEN WE COME TOGETHER FOR AN ASSIST. ENGINE THAT CAN PRESERVE AND CREATE EXPAND ACCESS TO JUSTICE ALL CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HE DOES THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HONORING US WITH YOUR PRESENCE TODAY AND SHARING THE STATED THE JUDICIARY- COLLEAGUES- THE COUNCIL'S. JUDICIAL COUNCIL'S RECEPTION WILL BE FOLLOWING AT THE STANLEY MOSK BUILDING AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SUPREME COURT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEAD BY AN INCREDIBLE LEADER AND A WONDERFUL WOMAN THANK YOU CHIEF JUSTICE. THANK YOU.
