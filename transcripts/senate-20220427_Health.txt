THANK YOU ALWAYS GRACIOUS ALL RIGHT ALWAYS OKAY SO WE'RE MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER THREE SB SEVENTY NINE BY SENATOR DODD WELCOME. WELCOME MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ESPECIALLY THE ESTEEMED- SENATOR EGGMAN FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS. I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANK YOU ALL AND YOUR STAFF FOR- YOUR WORK ON THE BILL I'LL BE ACCEPTING ALL THE AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED ON PAGE. SIX OF THE PALACES LIMITING THE BILL TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROVISIONS. SB NINE SEVENTY NINE AS AMENDED WILL CLARIFY THE GOVERNOR OR STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY THAT HEALTHCARE PLAN OR INSURER MUST PROVIDE ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY. HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ENROLLEES WHOSE HELP MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE EMERGENCY AND NOT TO JUST THOSE PHYSICALLY DISPLACED BY THE DISASTER. THE BILL CLARIFIES THE AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF- INSURANCE THAT'S DIEM AGENCY OR CDI TO REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS. TO TAKE SPECIFIED ACTIONS WHEN THE EMERGENCY AFFECTS OR MAY AFFECT. THE HEALTH OF THE ENROLLEE OR INSURED DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE LACK OF FLEXIBILITY IN STATUTE MEANT THAT THESE KEY STATE DEPARTMENT. DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE HEALTH PLANS AND INSURERS TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. IT'S PROVIDERS AND HOSPITALS EXPERIENCE THE PATCHWORK OF RESPONSES WITH MANY POINTS DECLINING TO TAKE PROACTIVE STEPS LIKE SUSPENDING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR PATIENT TRANSFERS BETWEEN HOSPITALS. SB NINE SEVENTY NINE ENSURES THAT IN THE FUTURE STATE OF EMERGENCY IMPACTING PUBLIC HEALTH THAT RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THAT PLANS INSURERS ENABLE PATIENTS TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. THIS WILL ALLOW PATIENTS CRITICAL ACCESS TO OUT OF NETWORK PER PERSON OR PHARMACIES WHEN IN NETWORK OPTIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE AND RELAXED TIME LIMITS FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS AND REFERRALS. URGENCY IS LIKE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC SHOWED US ALL- JOE IS THAT NOT ALL DISASTERS PHYSICALLY DISPLACE RESIDENTS IT IS CRITICAL THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAVE CONSISTENT ACCESS TO CRITICAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE INSTANCES. I HAVE CHRISTY WEEKS WITH ME TODAY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD I WOULD MAKE NO SENSE YOU ONLY HAVE ONE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS ANDERSON TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES- CHRISTY WE SELL WELCOME YOU- WELL ACTUALLY PERMITS YOU THE TOTAL FOUR MINUTES YOU DON'T USE ALL THE TIME YOU DON'T WANT THAT- FOUR MINUTES TESTIMONY. CENTER TO SOLE SUPPORT WITNESS. YOUR SENATE ARE CHRISTY WE SAW AFTER THE- HIGH. ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. OF APPRECIATE SENATOR DODDS YOU KNOW DESCRIPTION OF THE BILL AND ALL OF THE ASSISTANCE THE COMMITTEE PROVIDED US. AS HE STATED THE BILL GIVES DMH C. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN A STORY. THAT THEY MAY BE NEEDED THAT WE THINK THEY WANT. IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH. ANOTHER PANDEMIC A SENATOR PAM LIKES TO REMIND US WE ARE NOT OUT OF COPAYS YET. OR ANOTHER SIMILAR TYPE OF HEALTH EMERGENCY OR STATE OF EMERGENCY WHERE ENROLLEES ARE NOT PHYSICALLY DISPLACED. SO THE BILL BEFORE YOU IS MODEST WE WORKED THROUGH ALL THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION WITH THE HELP OF THE COMMITTEE. AND WE THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO MAKE SURE THAT. HOSPITALS AND ARE REGULATORS PLAN ABOUT THE FULL ABILITY THEY NEED TO MAKE THAT PATIENTS GET THE CARE THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO GET IN THE CASE OF REGENCY SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY WHICH WOULD STRIKE THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD EXTEND THE PLANNING PROCESS FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS- THIS BILL E'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT MADE THE PACKAGE IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE THOSE BILLS. AND AGAIN THIS ONE LOOKS AT MORE OF SOME OF THE FRONT END- ISSUES ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY DEALING WITH THE MHSAA- THE BILL REQUIRES COUNTIES TO SET AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROGRAMS. IN THE STATE TO MONITOR AND PUBLICLY REPORT THEIR PROGRESS. SINCE ITS PASSAGE IN TWENTY OH FOR THE MHSAA HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PREVENTION. EARLY INTERVENTION AND SUPERIOR SERVICE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AND AT RISK OF SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH AND. SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONDITIONS. OVER HOW ONLY ONE THIRD OF QUE. LIVING WITH A MENTALLY ILL RECEIVED TREATMENT THEY NEED. AND WITH OUR EVER WORSENING MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW'S THE TIME TO LOOK. AT WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM HOW WE CAN USE OUR MONEY MORE EFFECTIVELY. THIS BILL WOULD MODERNIZE MHSAA BY APPLYING A CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH REFINED THROUGH OTHER STATE PROGRAMS. WITH INPUT FROM THE STATE COUNTIES WILL ESTABLISH MEASURABLE OUTCOMES THAT ADDRESS THE TOP PUBLIC PRIORITIES. THAT COUNTIES IN REACHING THESE GOALS THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY WILL TEST THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ONE OF OUR PREMIER. THINGS WERE SO LUCKY TO HAVE HERE IN THE STATE. TO REPAIR ANALYSIS OF DATA CURRENTLY COLLECTED BY THE COUNTIES THAT MEASURES THE IMPACT OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON LIFE OUTCOMES. BASED ON THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE GOAL SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL THE AGENCY WILL ESTABLISH A SUITE OF MEASUREABLE OUTCOMES FROM WHICH- EACH COUNTY IN CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WILL IDENTIFY IT'S AN HSA PRIORITY GOALS- COUNTIES WILL TRACK AND REPORT ON THEIR PERFORMANCE FOLLOWED BY A SELF IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND REGULAR PROGRESS UPDATES. THE STATE WAIT ONLINE DASHBOARD WILL MAKE THAT INFORMATION EASILY ACCESSIBLE CREATING MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ALLOWING US. AS POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND COMPARE COUNTIES PROGRESS. THE STATE WILK SUPPORT COUNTIES IN REACHING THEIR GOALS TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING CREATIVE. CREATING COLLABORATIVE SPACES FOR COUNTIES TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. SETTING AMBITIOUS GOALS COMBINED WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND COLLABORATION WILL SPARK THE INNOVATION WE DESPERATELY NEED. A AND INSISTENCE ON ACCOUNTABILITY IMPROVEMENT WILL FOCUS MORE ENERGY ON RESEARCH AND RESOURCES ON FACILITATING THE RECOVERY AND THRIVING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS EVERY DAY. WITH ME TODAY IS THE AUTHOR OF THE ORIGINAL. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THERE. MAYOR DALE STEINBERG AND ON THE PHONE IS TARGET BONE EASTMAN SENIOR ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE SPINE SENATE. STEINBERG INSTITUTE. THANK YOU SIR EGGMAN MODERATOR PLEASE BRING ON THE LINE- THE HONORABLE MAYOR DARRELL STEINBERG MAYOR OF THE CITY SACRAMENTO AND THEN WE'LL OF COURSE ASSEMBLY TERRA GAMBLE EASTMAN IS HERE PRESENT SO- MAYOR STEINBERG GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU YOU HAVE. TWO MINUTES WE HAVE A TOLL FOUR MINUTES OF YOU GO OVER THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE OTHER TESTIMONY FROM DECEMBER GETS ITS A WELCOME. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR EGGMAN FOR NOT ONLY HEARING SB NINE SEVENTY BUT FOR HER WHOLE PACKAGE- MENTAL HEALTH REFORM BILLS- THIS IS THE YEAR- FOR REAL CHANGE AND PROGRESS AND NINE SEVENTY. IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PACKAGE- THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS NOT GENERATING PROJECTED GENERATE THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. IN CALIFORNIA IT IS RAPIDLY BECOMING THE LARGEST PUBLIC SOURCE OF MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING IN THE STATE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FIFTEEN PLUS YEARS. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY IT IS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS. IT HAS- PIONEERED THE IDEA OF FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHATEVER IT TAKES TO OPEN WELLNESS CENTERS THROUGHOUT. THE STATE THERE HAVE BEEN TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INNOVATION AND- THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE OF GOD HELP THE ONE CRITICISM. CONTINUED CRITICISM FRANKLY THAT WE'VE TAKEN A HARD I THINK HARD ABOUT FOR DECADES. IS THE IDEA THAT. THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES. SHOULD BE THAT DEVELOPING AN- MARC. OUTCOME SO THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS. HOW THIS- GIFT FROM THE VOTERS. IS ACTUALLY IMPROVING THE LIVES OF PEOPLE. THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA WHEN I WAS A YOUNG ASSEMBLY MEMBER FIRST YEAR ACTUALLY I BELIEVE I AUTHORED EIGHTY SIX THIRTY SIX BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE. TO BRING AN OUTCOMES BASED FOCUS TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM- THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY BUT IT PASSED. AND IT IS TURNED OUT TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE CHILD WELFARE BECAUSE NOW ALL THE COUNTIES TOGETHER WITH THE- ARE CONSISTENTLY REPORTING. OF THE OUTCOMES THAT THE PUBLIC WANTS TO WANTS TO SEE IT IS DRIVEN INNOVATION. IS DRIVEN CHANGE AND I THINK APPLYING THE SAME APPROACH. TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT OF WOULD GO ALONG WAY TOWARDS MAKING THIS. GREAT ACTING EVEN- I HAVE EVEN MORE OF THAT I SIGNIFICANT IMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WERE. TRYING TO SERVE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU I THANK YOU AGAIN THANK- NOW WILL THAT ACTUALLY BEFORE WE HAVE YOU UP.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MAC GALLAGHER WITH COWBOYS IS- I DO APPRECIATE CENTER EGGMAN'S. AMENDMENTS IN THE IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS WITH SB NINE SEVENTY AS IT'S DRAFTED. THE PREMISE OF THE BILL REALLY RAISES TWO ISSUES THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. THE FIRST IS WHO SHOULD PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT DAMAGES SAY. AND HOW SHOULD THAT OVERSIGHT BE CONDUCTED. THE WAY IT HAS BEEN FRAMED IN RECENT WEEKS- TO THE FIRST QUESTION IS. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR THE IMAGES SO EASY. BUT WHEN WE LOOK TO WHAT THE VOTERS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN THEY PASSED NOW SERVICES ACT. IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH THAT WAS ESSENTIAL IN AB THIRTY FOUR AB TWENTY THIRTY FOUR THAT WILL WERE THE PRECURSORS TO MENTAL SERVICES ACT. AND ONE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA PASSED PROPOSITION-SIXTY THREE THE DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH. WAS THE CRUX OF THE BILL. AND WHEN THE DRAFTERS DRAFTED PROP SIXTY THREE THEY DID NOT SEE HER IN THE COULDN'T FORESEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WOULD BEEN ONLY. ELIMINATED AS A WAS IN TWENTY ELEVEN. AND SO WHILE WE STRUGGLE TO DETERMINE WHAT AGENCIES SHOULD PROVIDE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE IMAGES SAY I'D AT THIS POINT I ASKED FOR THE PART AND I'LL BE BROUGHT BACK I BELIEVE THAT IS THE BEST AGENCY OR SHOULD BE THE BEST A TO SEE EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. FOR THE IMAGE SAY. MOVING TO THE SECOND POINT HOW SURE THAT OVERSIGHT BE PROVIDED. WHEN THE VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE THEY WERE TOLD THAT THREE YEAR PLANS WILL BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE STATE. THAT HAS BEEN SENSE ELIMINATE. TO DATE THREE YEAR PLANS GO TO THE STATE AND THERE IS NO APPROVAL PROCESS DONE WHATSOEVER. AND I JUST LIKE TO SHARE SOME NUMBERS WITH YOU. TWO POINT FOUR. POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS CURRENTLY M. HSA UNSPENT FUNDS ACCORDING TO THE AND IT JUST ALWAYS SEES FISCAL TRANSPARENCY SO ASSUMING THAT'S ACCURATE. FIVE FIVE COUNTIES HAD NOT SUBMITTED THREE YEAR IMAGES SAY PLANTS ASSUMING AGAIN DCS IS DATA IS CORRECT. AND A HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND A HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND. PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS ACCORDING TO TWENTY TWENTY HOMELESS STATISTICS. I STRUGGLE TO SEE WHAT SB NINE SEVENTY AZRAN DOES TO ADDRESS THOSE NUMBERS. WHEN THE IMAGES THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DRAFTED WE HAD OVERSIGHT MECHANISMS WE HAD STATE OVERSIGHT I STRUGGLE TO SEE WITH SB NINE SEVENTY DOES THAT DHS ALREADY COULD BE DOING. WHY DO WE NEED TO CREATE ANOTHER SYSTEM OF A MODEL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. AS IT STANDS IF IT'S PAST WILL HAVE HHS. THE OAC. DH CS AND WHEN THINGS GO WRONG FINGERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE POINTED AMONGST THE STATE AGENCIES AND WILL STILL BE PROVIDED IN THE SAME POSITION WE ARE NOW. A COMPLETE LACK OF OVERSIGHT WITH THE IMAGES THAT. HI I KNOW THIS IS TOUGH. THE FIRST TIME I MET DARRELL STEINBERG I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLD ON THE STEPS. OF THE WEST AND IN THE WEST TO THE WEST OF THE CAPITAL ADVOCATING FOR THE PASSAGE IN THE HOUSE SERVICES ACT. I WAS A YOUNG FOURTEEN YEAR OLD KID WALKING AROUND WITH THE L. A BALLOT INITIATIVE ASKING PEOPLE FOR SIGNATURES. I MADE A PROMISE THAT WE WILL TRANSFORM MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT TO DO THAT. BUT LET'S DO THAT BY PROVIDING REAL MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT IN THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE VOTERS APPROVED FROM THE PAST THIS ACT THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE OR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER EGGMAN THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT THE- FUNDING FOR OTHERS WHO ARE ALREADY COVERED- IN THIS PROGRAM THERE FUNDING WOULD BE VULNERABLE- I THINK THE DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR SUPPORT ALLIANCE BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGE IN MHA SAY FUNDING OPENS THEM UP TO. A RATE ON THEIR FUNDING GIVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT IS THAT RESULT FROM BEFORE THE BILL WAS AMENDED- I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT THE LATEST ANALYSIS THAT I HAVE- ALTHOUGH I DON'T RECALL THAT THE- SMOKE TODAY BUT I JUST. DID YOU MAKE SOME CHANGES THAT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THEIR FINES AREN'T TOUCH THERE WERE THERE WERE ORIGINALLY WITH THE BILL SOME- SOME BREAKING DOWN OF SOME BUCKETS THAT WERE REQUIRED FUNDING BUT THAT THAT IS NO LONGER PART OF THIS BILL. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE BILL RIGHTS BEEN MOVED BY SERA. ASSUR EGGMAN- REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL AND AGAIN YOU KNOW BUT THIS IS THE LIGHT OF THE ENTIRE PACKAGE- I CERTAINLY HEAR THE OPPOSITION- IT'S PERHAPS IT IS PERHAPS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE HAD BUT ALSO. IN MY MIND THAT BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL NOT SAYING THAT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT SESSION WE NEED TO HAVE FUTURE I KNOW THAT YOU. SERVE AS CHAIR OF OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEALTHY NEWMAN SERVICES I SERVICE CHAIR OF HEALTH WE BOTH SERVE TOGETHER ON EACH OTHER'S COMMITTEES- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY I HAVE IN MY TIME HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE STRUGGLED A BIT WITH AND US YOU DON'T THE DESTRUCTION HAS GROWN OPINIONS ABOUT HOW THINGS SHOULD BE ORGANIZED AND SO FORTH. AND I KNOW THAT- YOU PUT YOU PERHAPS HAVE SOME IDEAS AS WELL BUT- I ALSO THINK THAT. BY APPRECIATE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS TALKING ABOUT IT'S A BIT BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO CERTAINLY YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE AMENDMENTS- WHICH ARE CLOSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTENT THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR WORK ON THIS AND TO THE WITNESSES TO THE HONORABLE MAYOR STEINBERG THANK YOU FOR YOUR LIFETIME OF WORK ON THIS ISSUE- AND I WOULD AGREE WITH THE OPPOSITION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH COME BACK I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT. SINCE WE SINCE WE GOT RID OF IT LIKE SEEMS LIKE THINGS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE SINCE WE GOT RID OF IT SO- AMEN I AGREE- BUT THAT'S NOT THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL AND SO WE WERE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN WITHIN THIS AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT WE DID I DIDN'T LIVE PIECE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR. THAT GAVE THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION UP MORE ABILITY TO LOOK AT ALL THE MONEY THAT GOES INTO SERVING THE WHOLE PERSON CARE SO WE DID GIVE THEM MORE- OVERSIGHT ENTITIES- LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR WE JUST THINK THAT THE AGENCY HAS MORE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU SO THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED REFER TO COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS HAS BEEN SECONDED BY CENTER ROCK. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HAND BY HAND HI MELINDA'S LINDA'S HI EGGMAN EGGMAN AYE GONZALEZ GROVE HER TADO. LEYVA AYE FLAVOR I. ROTH HI ROTH I RUBIO. AYE RUBIO AYE WIENER. SIX MONTHS BY YOUR VOTES KERN SIX Z. HOLDOVERS. OF FEDERAL OPEN FOR APPS MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- SO LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR SB ELEVEN FORTY THREE BY SENATOR ROB. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A REVOLVING LOAN FUND THAT WOULD PROVIDE BRIDGE FUNDING TO BUILD ADDITIONAL ACUTE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS ONE CRITICAL PIECE OF OUR ESSENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE THE BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COUNTIES TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL NEED FOR INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC CARE WITH THE PROVEN FINANCIAL METHOD. THAT WORKS IN DEVELOPING PUBIC INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE IN OUR STATE ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THEY DO NOT HAVE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS TREATED FOR SOME. UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SYMBOL OF THEM DESTITUTE AND HOMELESS. MEANWHILE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING CALIFORNIA IS NOT KEPT UP WITH DEMAND. A RECENT RAND STUDY REPORTS THAT CALIFORNIA REQUIRES FIFTY POINT FIVE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ADULTS. TWENTY SIX PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AT THE ACUTE CARE LEVEL WE'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT THERE AND IN MANY CASES WITH UNFORTUNATE RESULTS. THIS LACK OF PSYCHIATRIC BED INFRASTRUCTURE IS PARTICULARLY ACUTE N HIGH DEMAND AREAS. SUCH AS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE COUNTY HAS EIGHT POINT THREE. ACUTE CARE PSYCHIATRIC BEDS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR THE STUDY AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY EVEN WORSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT. THE BILL IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT CAN PROVIDE COUNTIES WITH THE CRITICALLY NEEDED FUNDS TO JUMP START THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CUTE. PSYCHIATRIC INFRASTRUCTURE. WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL AND I'M ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT INCLUDE. THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENT DESCRIBED INCOME IN TEN OF THE ANALYSIS AS TO THE PARTICULAR CODE SECTIONS. INVOLVED AS WELL AS AMENDMENTS TO PERMIT COUNTIES TO APPLY FOR FUNDS TO ADD OR EXPAND INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC BEDS AT GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS. AND ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS BOTH OF WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO EXPAND PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT CAPACITY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. MOREOVER I INTEND TO WORK TOWARD ENDING COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES PHS TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL AND CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE OTHER ISSUES NOTED IN THE POLICY COMMENTS SECTION. OF THE ANALYSIS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D RESPECTFULLY AS FOR AN AYE VOTE ACTUALLY NO LEAD REGISTERED SUPPORT- WITNESS FOR TESTIMONY SO WILL NOW JUST OPEN I UP FOR. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN FORTY THREE PM ROOM TWELVE HUNDRED.

SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER TEN SB THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN BY SIR MCGUIRE WELCOME. FOR I WOULD TELL YOU NOT TO RUSH BUT I THINK THE RUSSIAN EVERYWHERE. WE LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. HEY FIRST AND FOREMOST JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR- AND WAS JUST COMING OVER FROM EQ SIDE COLLEGE ICE ABOUT KEEPING YOU WAITING. FIRST AND FOREMOST I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN HIS TREMENDOUS STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY WITH A BETTER BAIL OUT WITHOUT DOCTOR PAN AYE AND OF COURSE WE WILL BE TAKING. THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TODAY. MEMBERS YOU DO NOT NEED TO WALK FAR OUT OF THIS BUILDING OR IN YOUR HOME TOWN YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE FACING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND FOR RIGHT REASONS. MANY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT WHICH CAN LEAD TO INCREASED. RISK OF UNEMPLOYMENT HOMELESSNESS SUICIDE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE. IN ONE OF THE LEADING MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT CAN IMPACT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO LIVE A NORMAL LIFE. IS WHEN A PERSON EXPERIENCES OF PSYCHOSIS EPISODE. BECAUSE THIS IS A FEW SEVERE MENTAL DISORDER WHERE THOUGHTS AND PERCEPTIONS ARE SO IMPAIRED THAT INDIVIDUAL TRULY LOSES TOUCH WITH REALITY. EARLY PSYCHOSIS IS CONFUSING AND FRIGHTENING FOR THE PERSON WHO'S EXPERIENCING IT. AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THREE OUT OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE AN EPISODE AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE. IT WITHOUT MEDICAL INTERVENTION CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING PSYCHOSIS. HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES. THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN ONLY EVIDENCE BASED SUPPORT FOR THIS CONDITION IS CALLED COORDINATED SPECIALTY CARE. IT'S ALSO CALLED THE C. S. C. S. C. S. C. MODEL FOR SHORT. IT CREATES A PERSONALIZED TREATMENT PLAN. RAVAL SERVICE. TO GET LONGER MIDDLE HEALTH CARE ACT TO HOUSING ASSISTANCE WITH THAT YOU. AND VOCATIONAL GOALS THE PROBLEM IS MOST PRIVATE PAY INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS DON'T PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. SO THIS IS WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO IT ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA'S INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HEALTH PLANS COVER CSE AS A TREATMENT FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS. BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MANY YOUNG PATIENTS TO EXPERIENCE- THE PSYCHOSIS THEY'RE NOT BEING TREATED AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THIS MODEL WHICH REASSURED RESEARCH SHOWS CAN HELP. PATIENTS LIVE HEALTHY FUNCTIONALIZED IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT. YOU HAVE A PERSONAL FRIEND WHO IS EXPERIENCE IT. IS HEART BREAKING. AND PARA IMPACTS TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. SO WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WE NEED TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO MIDDLE HEALTHCARE IN COORDINATED SPECIALTY CARE IS A LIFE SAVING TREATMENT WHICH CAN LITERALLY SAVE A PERSON'S LIFE AND IT'S TIME FOR HEALTH PLANS IS. YOU KNOW NOT TRYING TO CALL ANYONE OUT BUT I JUST WANNA SHARE THE FRUSTRATION PERSONALLY. SO WITH HOLDEN IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE TO THOSE SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMATIC DISEASES APPALLING. IN IN THE CSU MODEL TEAM THAT INCLUDES A PRIMARY CARE CONDITIONS LIKE HIGH INTEREST THE CASE MANAGER ALL GO TO WORK TO BE A TO HELP THOSE GOING THROUGH THE EPISODE. FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON CARE DELIVERED IN THE CCS MODEL THERE'S A SIX DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENT RETURN ON INVESTMENT IN IMPROVED HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. COMMERCIAL HEALTH PLANS MAY SAY THAT THIS BILL IS TO DETAIL BUT THANKS TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT DOCTOR PAN IS OFFERED- IT GREATLY REDUCES THE DETAILED NATURE OF THIS BILL. CAN YOU MAY ALSO HEAR THAT WE SHOULD WAIT UNTIL TIED THE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. AND IS GOING TO SHARE MY FRUSTRATION WITH THAT. NONE OF US NEED ANYMORE STUDIES. YOU DON'T NEED ANY MORE PROJECTS TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. IN OUR STATE TODAY. THE ACA. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH CARE TO. MIDDLE HEALTHCARE DIRECTIVES CLEAR. MENTAL HEALTH CARE MUST BE COVERED YET A DECADE LATER WE'RE HERE. IN DOCTOR PAINS HEALTH COMMITTEE STILL DEBATING WHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S NOT. AND IN THE MEANTIME THOUSANDS IN THE CITY CONTINUE TO SUFFER. AND THIS BEING HONEST WE PUT PROFITS OVER PEOPLE. WITH OVER EIGHTY STUDIES DEMONSTRATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS CARE MODEL. WE MUST MOVE. IN WE NO LONGER CAN DELAY. IN ENSURING THAT THIS JOB IS DONE- AND WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A PAIN WE DO HAVE. TWO WITNESSES WHO. HERE IN SUPPORT TODAY. OKAY THANKS VERY THINK BELIEVE THEY'RE BOTH IN PERSON SO WE HAVE BODY HOLDS A- AND ALSO DOCTOR TERRA. IN THEM- SO EACH OF YOU HAVE. TO CLOSE WITH A FEW OF TOTAL FOUR MINUTES EACH TO HAVE TWO MINUTES WELL TWO MINUTES BOTH SIDES OF FOR THE FIRST BIGGER SPEAKS WHEN IT TWO MINUTES I'LL SAY TWO MINUTES. ANY ADDITIONAL TIME GOING OVER THAT COMES OUT THE OTHER PERSON'S TIME SO. JUST KEEP THAT BE VERY CONSCIOUS OF THAT- BUT YOU KNOW IT'S TWO MINUTES SO WITH THAT- WELCOME AND THAT PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND BEGIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON. WHEN I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT MY FAMILY'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE COORDINATED SPECIALLY CARE MODEL FOR FIRST EPISODES PSYCHOSIS. I IMMEDIATELY SAID YES AND WHY BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER IS ONE OF THE LIVES THAT IT WAS SAVED BY THIS INNOVATIVE TREATMENT MODEL. RACHEL WAS JUST FOURTEEN AND IT JUST STARTED HIGH SCHOOL. WITH ALL HER DUCKS IN A ROW SHE WAS PROUD OF A FOUR POINT OH GPA. SHE HAD A PASSION FOR MUSIC AND WON AWARDS STATE. WIDE AND LOCALLY FOR HER FLU PLANE SHE WAS A TALENTED VOLLEYBALL PLAYER. WITHIN A FEW SHORT MONTHS THOUGH ALL THIS STARTED TO CHANGE AS DID RACHEL HERSELF. ONCE LOVING HIGH ACHIEVING AND FOCUSED SHE BECAME WITHDRAWN DISORGANIZED. AN AGGRESSIVE ALARMED MY HUSBAND AND I DID WHAT ANY PARENTS WOULD DO WE'D MET WITH HER TEACHERS THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR WE CONSULTED WITH HER PEDIATRICIAN TOOK HER TO A PSYCHIATRIST ENGAGED HER IN THERAPY. ALL TO NO AVAIL NOTHING HELPED. WHEN WE STUMBLED UPON THE UC DAVIS EAT OUT CLINIC ALMOST EIGHTEEN LONG MONTHS LATER. RACHEL WAS DEEP INTO SELF HARM AND THOUGHTS OF KILLING HERSELF. YET THE CSU TEAM THERE WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY ROLL BACK HER MOST SERIOUS SYMPTOMS AND SET HER AND US HER FAMILY ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. CSC WORKS IT DOES. I KNOW THIS FROM THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF A PARENT WHO HAS GONE THROUGH CSE TREATMENT WITH HER OWN CHILD. AS WELL AS A RATHER UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE AS ALSO LATER HAVING WORKED AS PART OF A CSU TEAM AT UC DAVIS. HELPING OTHER FAMILIES NAVIGATE THIS VERY DIFFICULT ROAD WITH THEIR CHILDREN WHEN THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL APPROACHES THAT THEY- TRIED HAD FALLEN SHORT. AS A SENATOR REQUIRE SAID THE ONSET OF PSYCHOSIS IN A CHILD. IS DEVASTATING IT DISRUPTS OUR DEVELOPMENTS THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR FUTURE AND CAN BE OVERWHELMING FOR THE STRONGEST OF FAMILIES. EARLY INTERVENTION WITH CSC OFFERS THE BEST CHANCE FOR RECOVERY SO ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TWO MINUTES DESPERATE FOR THIS LIFE FLYING LIKE MY FAMILY WAS SO MANY YEARS AGO I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ARE NOW WITH THE DOCTOR AND THE NUMB- YOUR LOW SHORT ON TWO MINUTES HRE THAT'S OKAY- THANK YOU SO MUCH- I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROGRAMS AT UC DAVIS HEALTH I JUST NEED TO BE CLEAR THAT I'M HERE TESTIFYING TODAY AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN AND NOT REPRESENTING THE UC'S PERSPECTIVE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT SENATOR MCGUIRE SAID THIS DISORDER CONTRIBUTES TO HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATION LOST. LIVES IN TERMS OF WORK AND SCHOOL ATTAINMENT I AM SO PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SERVE FAMILIES LIKE BONNIE'S FAMILY AND HELP THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE RECOVER AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR I HAVE A MEDIC CAL PROGRAM IN A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM I CAN GIVE THE ROLLS ROYCE OF CARE IF YOU WALK IN AND YOU HAVE MEDICARE. IT IS A REVERSE DISPARITY IF YOU COME IN WITH INSURANCE I TRY MY BEST TO COBBLE THINGS TOGETHER BUT MY CLINICIANS DON'T GET PAID IF YOU CALL ME IN CRISIS THEY ONLY GET PAID IF THEY SEE YOU IN PERSON OR VIA TELEHEALTH.

RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH MODERATOR WILL NOW MOVE INTO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WE DO HAVE TO REGISTERED WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. WE HAVE A BEGIN WITH THE NECKLACES FROM CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS PRESS AND YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. TWO MINUTES FOR MEDICAL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NICK LOUISE'S WITH A CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND- I REGRETTABLY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN- STARTING GLOBALLY- MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS GENERALLY OPPOSES NEW BENEFIT MANDATES- AND THE REASON WE OPPOSE HIM IS BECAUSE THE IMPACT THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH HEALTH CARE. OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM RECENTLY ISSUED A CUMULATIVE IMPACT REPORT OF ALL OF THE MANDATES THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR. AND THAT TOTALS A PREMIUM INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS- AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE WHICH WILL BE HEARING LATER ON IN COMMITTEE TODAY WHICH ADDS ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUM INCREASES. ON INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. NOW ZEROING IN ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL- YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT YOU KNOW HEALTH PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER EVERY CONDITION IN THE DSM FIVE- IN SUBSEQUENT EDITIONS OF THAT MANUAL FOR PSYCHOSIS IS ONE OF THOSE DISORDERS. ON THAT IS INCLUDED IN THAT MANUAL SO THE CONDITION IS COVERED THE ISSUE WE HAVE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT- WELL YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW HITS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE OF THIS MODEL'S LONG TERM EFFECTIVENESS SO WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO DO IS. TAKE WHAT'S ALREADY COVERED AND A STATUTORILY MANDATE A PARTICULAR- MODEL OR MAP OF COVERING THE DISORDER AS OPPOSED TO- YOU KNOW MANDATING. A SERVICE AND SO THE MEDICAL DIRECTORS AND OUR PLANS ARE OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE- SCIENCE EVOLVES- YOU KNOW RESEARCH EVOLVES THERE COULD BE EVIDENCE BASED. TECHNIQUES BETTER BETTER IN THE FUTURE AND SO WE WOULD TO DO TO PUT LAW. THE SPECIFIC MAN. ANY SPECIFIC MODEL OF CARE- THAT MAY CHANGE OVER TIME I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING TAKEN TO THEY'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT BUT IT'S STILL REFERS TO A- SPECIFIC- MANUAL AM IN IN MY IN MODE OF CARE SO THAT THAT THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS OUR MEMBERS- YOU KNOW ON THE- BACK ON THE COST ISSUE YOU KNOW THE- THIS DOES REPRESENT A SEVENTY MILLION DOLLAR PREMIUM INCREASE. FOR PLANTS NOT IT'S NOT THE MOST EXPENSIVE MANDATE BILL- BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THESE BILLS SO WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE IT YOU LOOK FOR TO. FURTHER CONVERSATIONS DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS OF STAFF AND SPONSORS REACHING OUT EARLY ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH ANOTHER SPRING UP- PERSON YOUNG FROM CALIFORNIA RECOVERS WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRESTON YOUNG FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS IT. APPEARS IN PRINT. LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR STAFF COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO THIS BILL. I'M IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID REDUNDANCY- YOU. MISTER LOUISA'S TALKED ABOUT COST CONCERNS WITH THE MANDATE BILLS CORRECT THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE IN OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE OF THE COST CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL THAT YOU BERMAN ALICE'S FOR EMPLOYER RELATED PREMIUMS. PAID THAT INCREASE OF THE BILL WENT INTO EFFECT AS IT WAS ANALYZED AT THE TIME. AS BEING A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN THE EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE OVER SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS SO- IN ISOLATION OBVIOUSLY NOT A HUGE DEAL. COLLECTIVELY IN IN THE AGGREGATE WITH ALL THE ME IN THE BILLS WE SEE THIS YEAR. THAT DOES HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT SO THAT'S THE CONCERN- IN THE PERSPECTIVE WE'RE COMING FROM HERE. AGAIN A RESPECT THE INTENTION BILL. AND APPRECIATE THE TIME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK FOR NOW TAKE ON IT- THIS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO SB THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION.

BRING THE LINE FOR ONE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAMBERS HE WHAT INVOLVED THE HAPPIEST OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE NEEDS AND OPPOSITION THANK YOU SIX WITNESS. AND OCE AGAIN MADE IN GENERAL IF YOU ARE OPPOSITION S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY SEVEN PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO PARTY THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER LEYVA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO THINK- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOUR TO. LEAVE WITNESSES FOR REALLY BRINGING HOME THE ISSUE AND JUST REALLY GIVING US AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHY THIS IS NEEDED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU CENTER MCGUIRE. OF THE BILL INAPPROPRIATE ALL RIGHTS BEEN MOVED BY- SIR LEYVA A CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- I AS I WORKED A LITTLE BIT IN THIS SPACE BEFORE AND VISITED THE VERY FINE PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS SO. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I WAS UP THERE IN ANOTHER MEETING AND MY STUFF THAT I SHOULD GET DOWN HERE. SO I CAN HAS TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY. SARATH THANK YOU MISTER JUST CURIOUS I'VE READ THE VARIOUS OF WITH MANDATES ON THE- INSURANCE HEALTH CARE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE OPPOSITION IT'S HARD FOR ME TO PROCESS THOUGH THE IMPACT ON EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE PREMIUMS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FORTY ONE MILLION OR SEVENTEEN MILLION COULD SOMEBODY AND TELL ME WHAT THE- ACTUAL IMPACT WOULD BE ON AN EMPLOYEE WHO'S HAVING TO PAY A PREMIUM OR AN EMPLOYER WHO'S HAVING TO PAY A PREMIUM. SO ACTUALLY I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE SUCH ABOUT THE QUESTION UP- JOHN LEWIS FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM- THAT KILL IS MISTER LEWIS IS JOHN LEWIS ON THE LINE. FROM THE CALIFORNIA BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM. THIS IS JOHN LEWIS ALL RIGHT I'M- OF THOSE WHICH BURKE YOU HEAR ME YES IF YOU WISH TO PLEASE A ADDRESS US A ROUGH QUESTION. OKAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REPORTED TO WORK LOOK AT IT FOR NOW THERE'S- ACTUALLY GIVES THE MEMBER PER MONTH. INCREASE OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. IN THE AREA- MARC EGGMAN. SO IT'S- JERRY IT'S PROBABLY THE DANGER OF. EIGHT AM REMEMBER FROM- UP TO. FIFTY TWO YEAH REMEMBER PER MONTH THE KIND OF INCREASED THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED. HELPFUL THIRTY EIGHT CENTS TO FIFTY TWO CENTS PER EMPLOYEE PER MONTH- ON THE EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTION WHAT'S THE EMPLOYER SHARE- THAT WOULD VERY FIRST ON P. THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP NUMBERS THE TOTAL WOULD BE SHARED BETWEEN THE EMPLOYER BUT HE- WHEN THERE IS AN EMPLOYER LIKE. WILDLIFE INDIVIDUAL MARKET WITH THE- WORN BY THE PERSON THIS PROJECT AND BY THE- ICC THE THIRTY EIGHT CENTS TO FIFTY TWO CENT PER MONTH INCLUDE PREMIUM INCREASE WOULD EITHER BE BORNE SOLELY BY THE EMPLOYEE OR SHARED OR SPLIT BETWEEN THE EMPLOYEE AND THE- EMPLOYER IF THERE'S A- PREMIUM SHARING ARRANGEMENT. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION THANK YOU MR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ANYTHING WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT ACCESS TO A GOOD CARE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I ALSO WANT TO JUST THINK THE FAMILY WHO STRICTER PERSONAL STRUGGLES AND STORIES I KNOW SOMETIMES WE- WE DON'T NECESSARILY GET TO HEAR SOMEONE LIKE YOU KNOW THAT THE LADY WHO SHARED THE STORY ABOUT HER DAUGHTER I KNOW I HAVE CASES YOU KNOW AS A- FORMER TEACHER OF STUDENTS WHO. YOU KNOW OUR HIGH PERFORMING HIGH FUNCTIONING AND THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING HAPPENED BETWEEN THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD- DID THIS JUST IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST EXPRESS RIGHT NOW IS YOU KNOW MAYBE THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE A REVIEW PROCESS IN LIGHT OF EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY PROGRAMS AND THINGS THAT YOU KNOW. THAT WE LEARNED LATER SO SOME KIND OF REVIEW PROCESS THAT MAYBE YOU KNOW LOOKS BACK AND SEE IF YEARS FROM NOW IF IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE IN IS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE IS A LEGISLATIVE BODY BUT THAT'S THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE YOU KNOW ACCESS AND TAKE THE FAMILY FOR COMING FORWARD AND SHARING THEIR PERSONAL STRUGGLES THANK YOU. THANK ARE SEVERAL OTHERS. THANK YOU MISTER. I'M A SINNER. IF YOU WOULDN'T AND IN THE- HAS- MADE CLAIMS THAT THAT THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS BILL ARE DUPLICATIVE AND I WONDER. IF THEY COULD ELABORATE ON THAT- AND THEN PERHAPS HEAR YOUR VIEWS ON THAT. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SOME PROGRAMS IN PLACE BECAUSE JUDITH A LITTLE MEAT ON THE BONES FOR MEDIA ASHER SENATORS SO- IN TERMS OF BEING DUPLICATED I THINK WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT PSYCHOSIS IS CURRENTLY COVERED. YOU KNOW AS A DISORDER UNDER THE DSM FIVE- IN SUBSEQUENT. EDITIONS OF THAT OF% THAT MANUAL- AND AGAIN WHAT THIS DOES IS IT MANDATES A SPECIFIC MODEL OF CARE FOR THAT DISORDER. AND YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS BUT ONE OF MY HEALTH PLANS THE KAISER PERMANENTE A IS. OPERATING A PILOT PROGRAM CURRENTLY- IN THE NAPA SONOMA- AREA. I ACTUALLY BELIEVE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BROADER THAN THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY BUT ANY CASE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY'RE TESTING OUT THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF CARE IN TO SEE IF IT WORKS AND SO- DO YOU TO YOURPOINT ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS PREMATURE NOT I THINK YOU KNOW. SINCE THERE IS AN EXISTING PILOT PROGRAM IN PLACE YOU KNOW WE SHOULD SEE WITH THAT YIELDS YOU KNOW BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GET TO THIS LEVEL SPECIFICITY INTO LAW. THANK YOU WOULD YOU MIND- ALSO GIVING COMMENT ON YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT PSYCHOSIS IS ALREADY COVERED- AND HOW THIS BILL WOULD IMPROVE THE SITUATION. SO HERE'S WHERE I AGREE I'M GOING TO TURN OUR ATTENTION TO THE CENTRAL HEALTH BENEFIT UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. MIDDLE HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENTS MUST BE COVERED UNDERNEATH THAT. THIS ISN'T. IT'S NOT BEING COVERED WE CAN REFER BACK TO THAT KAISER STUDY NAPA SOLANO AND SONOMA COUNTIES THE TIE THE PROJECT LET ME JUST BE REALLY CAN'T DENY LIVES IN THAT REGION. THAT REGION OF KAISER AND I'M A FULL DISCLOSURE KAISER PATIENT THEY HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE WITHIN THAT REGION OF KAISER. TREMENDOUS CHALLENGES. AND JUST BEING REALLY BLUNT ABOUT IT HOW MANY STUDIES IMPACT THEIR PARTY SO WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO. WE KNOW THAT THE ONLY THE ONLY PEER REVIEWED. TREATMENT IS C. S. C. S. AND IT'S NOT BEING PROVIDED. THE ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO IF AN INDIVIDUAL HAS OUR FIRST PSYCHOSIS EPISODE IS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM THE WRAPAROUND TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IF WE DON'T GET THAT WRAP AROUND TREATMENT. IS THAT IT LEADS TO. LOSING A JOB. HOMELESSNESS IN SOME CITIES. AND THAT'S REMEMBER WHAT WE'RE SPENDING THIS YEAR FOR HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. FOURTEEN BILLION. FOR WILLING TO WRAP MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES AROUND EACH OF THOSE FIFTY THOUSAND UNITS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DANCING BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SPEND THIRTY EIGHT TO FIFTY TWO CENTS A MONTH TO BE A PROVIDE THE REFERENCE SERVICES SOMEONE NEEDS TO HAVE A PSYCHOSIS EPISODE. THE POLY. THIS ISN'T ABOUT. PEOPLE IT'S TALKING ABOUT PROFIT IT'S ALREADY COVERED WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE DEBATES WHEN WE KNOW THE ACA SUPPOSED TO BE COVERING THIS SO I'M NOT AT ALL TRYING TO GET HOT SYMBOL IT IS A YOU AT ALL- BUT I'M JUST SHARING MY FRUSTRATION THAT LITERALLY WE HAD THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT THAT WE THOUGHT WERE GOING TO GET THIS SOLVED THEN WE HAVE THE ACA AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SOLVE. AND NOW WE'RE BACK HERE IN HEALTH COMMITTEE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS GONNA BE COVERED BY THE HEALTH PLANS OR NOT IT NEEDS TO BE AND WOULD ASK FOR AN ADULT SO WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IT OR YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING THE FACT THAT IT IS. TECHNICALLY COVERED WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. THE PLANS ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING. THE COVERAGE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE- SAYING OKAY- SO- I. WELL WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS REALLY TO ADDRESS THE NEED I MEAN. I KNOW YOUR BILL DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT BUT WE JUST WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ATTEND TO THE NEEDS OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND I THINK YOU KNOW THAT- WHEN YOUR BILLS NOT TRYING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT- WITH THIS BILL. THOUGH IT REQUIRES THE PLANS TO PROVIDE THE COVERAGE IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THE HELP THAT THEY NEED DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE- THAT THE ONLY ONE I WOULD SAY ON THIS HE SAID. I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS FOR PRIVATE PAY INSURANCE SO IF YOU ARE- IF YOUR PAIN WE KNOW THAT ARE COVERED BY SOME TYPE OF PRIVATE PAY INSURANCE. YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE. THE CARE NEEDED AS PROMISED WITH IN THAT PREMIUM WELL I'LL TELL YOU THAT- DELAY IN MY DISTRICT AND FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM PARENTS AND FRIENDS THAT. IT IS VERY HARD TO FIND SOMEONE TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PARTICULARLY TO ADOLESCENTS- I MEAN THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH OF THEM AROUND AND THEN WHAT THEY'VE DONE. MOST RECENTLY AS THEY'VE CHANGED THE- THE CARE TO- NOT IN PERSON. THEY WANNA DO REAL NINETY ASSUME. WHICH IS KIND OF WHAT GOT A LOT OF THESE ANYWAY- SO IT'S DIFFICULT YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IF THEY'RE NOT PEOPLE BUT- AGAIN THAT'S- THAT THAT IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM TO SOLVE RIGHT NOW I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW THE SILVER BULLET THAT. THAT TO HANDLE THIS PROBLEM- BUT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT IF THE PLAN SAY THEY'RE GOING TO- COVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD PROBABLY DO THAT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND- THE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CETERA THANK YOU MISTER- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE- OPPOSITION TENT. SEEMS TO BE FOCUSED ON EVOLVING TECHNOLOGY AND- IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY PER. INDICATING THE PREPS IS BILL OXIS INTO A PARTICULAR TREATMENT PROTOCOL WHEN. TREATMENT PROTOCOLS MAY CHANGE IN A- FOR FARM SUPPORTING THE BILL. OF THE BILL. AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- IT'S SORT OF BEEN MOVED GOOD SO THEY PUT ME ON THE LIST- I GUESS MY SUGGESTION IS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD PERHAPS. YOU COULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT SUGGESTS THAT IF MORE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS ARE SUBSEQUENTLY IDENTIFIED. THOSE MIGHT BE AS MAY BE SUBSTITUTED IN PLACE OF THE ONE SPECIFIED IN THE BILL. HEY HAPPY TO DO THAT I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND AGAIN HAPPY TO DO THAT AND- LOOK AT IT THERE BEEN EIGHTY DIFFERENT PEER REVIEWED STUDIES- THAT SAYS IT C. C. REALLY IS THE- ONLY AND MOST EFFECTIVE. WHEN IT COMES TO A AN EARLY PSYCHOSIS EPISODE BUT- HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT RENDON IF THAT REMAINS THE CASE AND I GUESS. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE WHAT OF WHAT YOU FAST FOR IN THE BILL. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU- THE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SAYING NINE- FIRST OF ALL SIR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH MY- COMMITTEE STAFF I APPRECIATE YOU GIVE ME THE CREDIT BUT MY COMMITTEE STAFF THE SYSTEM. IS MOST OF THE WORK. ALTHOUGH I DID TRY I DID TRY TO GIVE THEM SOME SUGGESTIONS- FOR MY BACKGROUND- BUT- YOU POINTS THAT I ALSO LIKE TO MAKE- SO- AND AGAIN AS YOU POINTED OUT- IN TERMS OF. YOUR TREATMENT FOR THIS CONDITION- NO THERE THERE'S A BASE OF EVIDENCE THAT YOU. DID IN ITALY SOME BILLS SO MISSILE MAKES BUT LET'S LET'S POINT OUT THAT SUPER FAST AND THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. IN ORDER TO. SAY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT- COMPARED TO USUAL OUT L. CHIEF INFORMATION AS USUAL- THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING HERE AND PRODUCED FEMALE INSURANCE IMPROVES POSITIVE NEGATIVE CUTTING. BROUGH JENNER. NAY REDUCES EMISSIONS TO SIGN. COST THERE'S LEVINE- EARNS EVIDENCE THAT. WELL TERM. BUILD LESS CERTAIN RIGHT TALKED ABOUT THE LIMITED EVIDENCE BUT SOMETIMES IT'S LIMITED EVIDENCE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE STATE BUT WE DO HAVE A PROFOUND SENSE FROM SOME PRETTY GOOD THINGS TO HAPPEN. RELATION TO THAT. ALSO I THINK MAKE NOTE THAT- WILL CERTAINLY WIN IN THIS BILL WE'RE SAYING THAT. THE IS CSE SHOULD BECAUSE CORRECTLY WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S COVERED THERE FOR YOU REALLY PSYCHOTIC THAT'S THE ONLY SO I MEAN WE DO LEAVE THAT. OUT WE DO WHAT THE JUDGMENT OF THE- OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE PROVIDING CARE AND THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE AND- AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SURE THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO FIGHT YEAH THEY'RE SAYING THATTHIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND THAT'S GOING TO GET COVERED I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WELL CERTAINLY I AGREE THAT THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WHAT'S WHAT'S EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU'RE A- PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER IS THAT EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE A SHORTAGE OF ANY OF THE PATIENT FRONT IF YOU. IN THE FACE OF VALUE GETS TO YOU. THANK YOU TO ALL THE INSURANCE WILL COVER THE TREATMENT THAT YOU THINK IS BEST FOR THE PATIENT. WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE SO YES WE NEED MORE. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE CRAFTED DISSING US OF ALL THE ACCESS PROBLEMS. BUT THE ONCE IT BUT BUT WE CERTAIN CERTAINLY SHOULD BESTOPPING TO PROVIDERS AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. SPREAD TO CARE- YOU KNOW I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT YOU KNOW I AM SENSITIVE. TO THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT. YEAH ADDITIONAL MANDATES AND SO FORTH- WE LOOK AT THESE CAREFULLY THAT'S YOU KNOW AGAIN APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH COMMITTEE. YEAH WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THAT- I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO. TALK ABOUT CONTROLLING HEALTH CARE COSTS ULTIMATELY. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE OF HEALTH INSURANCE WON'T COVER THE CARE. THAT YOU NEED RIGHT I MEAN PEOPLE PAYING PREMIUMS. ON THE ACTUALLY NEED TO CARE. AND IT'S GONNA SAY SO YOU KNOW WE DEFINITELY WANT TO LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE WE DON'T WANNA BE COVERING THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO WORK IT CETERA BUT- CERTAINLY- AT LEAST. I FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THERE ARE. NO SUFFICIENT BENEFIT TO MAKE THIS. YOU KNOW- MORE DIFFER AS THE- FOR COVERAGE AND SO WITH THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE SUPPORTING THE WORKING COMMITTEE WITH LIKELY. RESPECT FAST THANK YOU IN A VERY BUSY DAY. OKAY THANK YOU ALRIGHT SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST AMENDED REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS BEEN SECONDED BY SEVERAL LEYVA. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL HAND HI CAN I AM MELINDA'S. EGGMAN EGGMAN I GONZALEZ CONSOLES I GROWTH HER TADO. LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE LIMÓN LIMON I ROTH. ROTH AYE RUBIO HI RUBIO. AYE WIENER WIENER HI. EIGHT THANK. THE CURRENT VOTES KERN EIGHT ZERO HOLDER OPEN FOR MEMBERS. OF HE'S- CAN TO CAPTURE OUT OKAY NOW WE SHOULD YEAH BECAUSE YEAH ALL RIGHT SIR COME LONGER WELCOME. AND JUST A REMINDER FOR EVERYONE- SUSIE FINISH SERIK MY GUESS IS THAT SUSIE FINISH CENTCOM LONGEST BILL WILL BE READY FOR A SPECIAL ORDER THOUGH WHICH IS- AGAIN ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SP THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL BE FOLLOWING THIS ITEM SO WE WILL SO WE ARE CURRENTLY ON ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE BY CENTER COMMA WELCOME. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE REFORMING PRESCRIPTION REBATES I HAVE TO SAY I DO LIKE THAT THIS IS TALL ENOUGH. FOR THE TALL PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I WANT TO FIRST START BY SAYING. BUT I ACCEPT COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS YOU SIR INNER BURKE. S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE SOLICITOR I WANT TO SAY AGAIN EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE MINISTER THANK YOU OKAY SO S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE WILL ENSURE PATIENTS ARE BETTER ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR MEDICATIONS BY REFORMING THE STATE'S PRESCRIPTION DRUG REBATE SYSTEM TO BENEFIT THE PATIENT AND NOT HEALTH INSURANCE. RATIONS CURRENTLY THE PATIENT PAYS FOR A DRUG AND THE DEDUCTIBLE PHASE OR PAYS COINSURANCE AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER. THE AMOUNT THEY MUST PAY IS BASED ON THE FULL PRICE OF THE DRUG EVEN IF THEY'RE HEALTH INSURERS. AND PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS MANAGER ARE PAYING A LOWER AMOUNT THEY NEGOTIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURER. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE REPORTED THAT HEALTH PLANS RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN REBATES UP 57% FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN. BECAUSE THERE ARE A TRANSPARENCY IN THE SYSTEM PATIENTS HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH IF ANY REBATE MONEY GOES TOWARDS LOWERING INSURANCE PREMIUMS. OR LOWERING OTHER OUT OF POCKET COSTS. WITH PRIOR LEGISLATION ONLY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY TO A PORTION OF THE SYSTEM SB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE WILL ADD MUCH NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS TO NOT ONLY ENSURE DISCOUNTS ARE BENEFITING THE PATIENT. BUT ALSO TO ALLOW FOR A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE TRUE PRICE THE DRUGS AND THEIR IMPACT ON PREMIUMS. SPECIFICALLY IT WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF ALL REBATES FOR ME LARRY DESIGN UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT AND GRIEVANCES AND APPEAL PROCESS SEES. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA PBMS ARE ONLY REQUIRED TO EXERCISE GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING WITH THE HEALTH PLANS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH. IN FACT CALIFORNIA'S STATUTE PUTS THE ONUS ON THE HEALTH PLAN TO ENSURE THE PBM ACTS IN GOOD FAITH MEANING THERE IS NO STATUTORY REQUIREMENT FOR THE PBM TO DO SO. SO S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE REQUIRES A PBM TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING TO ENROLLEES HEALTH INSURERS PLANS AND PROVIDERS. AS SUCH S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE REMOVES THE ABILITY FOR PBMS TO RETAIN EXTRA REBATE DOLLARS BASED UPON THE LIST PRICE OF A DRUG. THE AMOUNT OF REBATES COLLECTED OR PATIENT OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AGAIN THESE DISCOUNTS WERE NEVER INTENDED TO FLOW TO THIRD PARTY PBMS THESE DOLLARS ARE MEANT TO DIRECTLY LOWER THE COST OF A PATIENT'S PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER. BY SHARING THE PHARMACY COUNTER SB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE WILL IMMEDIATELY LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS HELPING CALIFORNIANS BETTER ACCESS THEIR MEDICINES. AND BETTER IT HERE TO THE TREATMENTS THAT THEY NEED TO STAY HEALTHY. AT TWENTY TWO COOPER REPORT OF A SIMILAR POLICY MEASURE FOUND THAT IT IS CLEARLY POSSIBLE FOR PHARMACY SOFTWARE TO BE UPDATED TO SHARE REBATES AT THE POIT OF SALE AS OUTLINED IN THIS BILL. THE SOFTWARE ALREADY ALLOWS FOR POINT OF SALE VARIATION IN PRICES COST SHARING AMOUNTS BENEFIT COVERAGE AND FORMULARY INFORMATION. SO WITH ME HERE IN SUPPORT I THINK BOTH BY PHONE. OUR DOCTOR LEON DRUG CLARK HARVEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ACCESS COALITION AND DR GINA WARREN A CLINICAL PHARMACIST WITH TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WELLNESS FOUNDATION AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

OUR MISSION IS TO BRING YOUR REPRESENTATIVE DID NOT GET HER TO JOINTLY CREATE POLICY ADVOCATE FOR PATIENTS AFTER HEALTH TREATMENT ELEVEN INDUSTRY PARTNERS AND DO THE RIGHT THING FOR PATIENTS WE SUPPORT IT NO MATTER IF IT WILL SAVE JUST FIVE HUNDRED OR OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PATIENTS MONEY AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER AT THIS BILL WITH ESTIMATED TO DO. SIMPLY ARTICLE OF THE LOWER PATIENTS OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I WAS AMAZED HEY THIS IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IN PREMIUM WILL NOT ROCK. IT'S BEEN DONE VOLUNTEER BY TV AND THE MORE SPRING LEAD TO. HAVE PASS IN ANOTHER STATE. LET'S LOOK AT. TWENTY TWENTY BY- FOUND THAT 51% OF. SKIPPED OR POST HERE DUE TO ONE PER SAID DOING SO. IN THEIR CONTENT THERE. ACCORDING TO A STUDY BY CHIPPER. POLICY WOULD SEE AT LEAST HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ALONE. MOST IMPORTANT THIS TREND OF FORGOING HEALTH CARE DUE TO HIGH CALL IS UNTENABLE. SB. THIRTEEN FIFTY ONE PROVIDE A REMEDY. IN TWENTY NINETEEN- ALONE PBMS IN THE US BECAUSE SHE DID EIGHTY NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IN A REBATE OVERALL IN A RECENT REPORT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE FOUND THAT. TWENTY TWENTY HOW CLINTON CALIFORNIA RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AND REBATES FROM MANUFACTURERS. WHAT PBMS AND INSURERS MAKE BILLIONS PATIENTS OFTEN END UP PAYING MORE FOR THE PRESCRIPTION AND THE PDN AN INSURER PAID FOR IT. THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE NOT MET THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO DOCTOR BILL AND MUST PAY OUT OF POCKET AT THE PHARMACY COUNTER ARE OFTEN FORCED TO PAY THE FULL. PRICE OF THE MEDICATION NOT THE REBATE. IT WAS NOT. TO LOWER. MEDICATION COSTS FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING THE THOUSANDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES TO A HIGH DEDUCTIBLE PLAN. HI OUT OF POCKET COSTS. MAKE IT DIFFICULT AND OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FOR THEIR MEDICATIONS. ALL OF THIS IS INTENSIFIED BY PANDEMIC THAT IS HITTING PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. WHO ARE IN NEED OF MEDICATION THE HARDEST. SO I IMPLORE YOU AS A PSYCHOLOGIST AN ADVOCATE AND OF THE PATIENT TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS.

THANK YOU OKAY. THE SERVER RUBIO. AT THE YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I ALSO KNOW THE YOU KNOW OUR ECHO MY THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE THAT JUST AND TIME WE CAN HEALTH LOWER THE COST IT IS IMPORTANT AND YOU KNOW THE COSTS KEEP RISING AND PEOPLE ARE HAVING A HARDER AND HARDER TIME GETTING ACCESS TO IT TO MEDICATION BUT YOU KNOW I JUST WANT- AND THIS IS NOT FOR THE AUTHOR BUT MAYBE FOR YOUR SUPPORTERS ARE PROPONENTS THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS HOW. THIS BILL CAN INTERSECT OR PERHAPS YOU KNOW- IMPACT I KNOW AS A BODY WE HAVE FIVE PUT CAPS ON COAL PIECE I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT. IT DOESN'TCOME COLLECTED CAN THEY ADDRESS THE COPAYS AND WE'VE CAPPED AN END OF THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SARAH YES. OKAY BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE SO BUT RIGHT IF YOU WISH PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF THANK YOU ISSUE REALISTIC FROM PHARMA FOR THE RECORD SENATOR RUBIO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION IN THE STANDARD PLAN FOR COVERED CALIFORNIA PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE CAPPED- COST SHARING IS CAPPED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS IF YOU'RE IN A STANDARD TIER PLAN THAT COULD BE BASED OFF OF CO INSURANCE OR ON COPAYMENT- AND SO. YOU COULD STILL BE PAYING OFF THE LIST PRICE OF THE DRUG EVEN IF- IF YOU HAVE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR CAP IF YOU'RE PAYING ON CO INSURANCE IN ADDITION WHEN YOU'RE IN THE DEDUCTIBLE PERIOD YOU HAVE A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP DEDUCTIBLE HEARING CALIFORNIA YOU CAN STILL BE PAYING OFF OF. THE LIST PRICE FOR THOSE DRUGS SO THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE THAT- DAY. BENEFIT AND THEN IT GOES. TO REPAY PRICE OF THE AT THE POINT OF SALE NOT THE HIGHER LIST PRICE AND THERE WAS- SOME AMENDMENTS ADDED. BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN SENATE HEALTH TO MAKE SURE THERE WOULDN'T BE A CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING PROTECTIONS OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR CAP. IN THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR TO CAP ON DEDUCTIBLE THE PATIENT WE GET WHATEVER THE LOWER ONE WAS. VIEW UP HERE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON ONE MORE OTHER ISSUE AND I'M SORRY STEPPED OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT- YEAH I KNOW THAT THAT THERE'S CONCERNS AND I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL HEARD. IS THAT IT'S GOING TO POSSIBLY INCREASE THE COST ACROSS THE BOARD IN OTHER AREAS SO HELP SOME BUT NOT OTHERS CAN YOU. RESPOND TO THAT. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THAT YOUR BOURBON ALICE'S FOUND THAT PREMIUMS WOULD INCREASE ABOUT. POINT 3% BUT SAVE THE AVERAGE CAN- THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR- WE'VE DONE OUR OWN ANALYSIS I HAVE FOUND THAT AN AVERAGE DIABETIC WOULD SAVE SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS A YEAR. ON THEIR INSULIN AND WE THINK THAT MAKE A REAL THAT. THANK SPON IS. I ALSO WANNA ASK AT THE OPPOSITION CAN I HAVE SOMEONE TO ANSWER SOME OF MY QUESTIONS. WE CAN EITHER HAVE MISTER HAD COME BACK AS IT IS ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE ARE WE A PERSON YOUNG HERE'S WELL AND SELF AND I GUESS YOU GET OUTSIDE WHO WANTS ANSWER QUESTIONS UP. TELL YOUR PLEASE COME OF THE RECORD ON THE FREEDOM GARDLER IF YOU WISH TO DEFER TO MISTER HEAD OF ASK HIM TO COME ON OVERHEAD SO. YOU'LL HAVE TO CALL HE'S FROM FROM THE CHAMBER I'M NOT SURE YOU YOU MAY BE ABLE TO AND OKAY BUT WE CAN TRY BECAUSE I ALSO. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HEARING THE OTHER SIDE RIGHT AND SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO. YOU KNOW BE DO YOU SEE DIFFERENTLY OR AT THE OPPOSITION SEES A DIFFERENTLY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING IT GOING TO BE SCOTT WHILE. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN YOU CAN. DILLONLIAM YEAH MR HEADS I'VE HAD A- CENSUS ON THAT SO. YES WE CAN PLEASE IN PLEASE PLEASE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE QUESTION AND IN OUR- POSITION IS VERY SIMILAR TO BURKE AND TO. PRESSURE BUT YOU'RE A WHEN SCORE THE FEDERAL- THIS. YES SOME PATIENTS WILL AND THEY MONEY. I'M INTERESTED. ALL PATIENTS FALL. THEIR COST SAVING. SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE FOR BECAUSE OF SOMETHING BUT YOU KNOW INTO LIKE WHAT PURPOSES HOSPITAL REMAIN. OKAY I. YEAH BECAUSE I KEEP COMFY YOU KNOW NUMBER OF SUPPORT BILL JUST SO YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOWER THE COST FOR PATIENTS BUT I'M TRYING GET NOTICED FIVE OTHER SOMETHING WOMEN IS KEEP HEARING THE SAME COIN TO DIFFERENT SITE POINT BY THERE IS A DISCREPANCY AND I'M AND TO. SUPPORT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT OR AT I'LL ON THE OPPOSITE GATE LATE COMER AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE OF AN OFFER THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THE CARD ABOUT. THE CAN NOW ABOUT SKINHEAD. MORE WE'RE AT USE. THAT MEMBERS CONCLUDED SO WE'RE MY ON NOW. SO YOU GIVING YOUR- SIR RUBIO. SERA THANK YOU MISTER MAYBE SOME COULD NOT. QUITE BEFORE AND MAYBE. IT'S BEEN STATED- AS A RESULT THIS PROPOSED CHANGE IN THIS BILL WHAT IS THE AVERAGE INCREASE. ON AN EMPLOYEE'S PREMIUM IN AN EMPLOYER SPONSORED PLAN. FOR THE INDIVIDUAL'S PREMIUM IN AN INDIVIDUALLY PROCURED. PLAN SO ACTUALLY DOING SO I'LL LET THE WHAT I WHAT I THE INFORMATION I HAVE AS AN EXAMPLE M. IS THAT YOU KNOW IT COULD GO UP BY POINT 3% SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE PAYING TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS IT COULD GO UP BY 60% BUT I MEAN BY SIXTY AND PRICE IS. THAT'S WHY PRYING TO GET IS I HEAR THESE BIG NUMBERS. AND AN ICE WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS TRYING TO GET AT IS WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE INCREASE GOING TO BE TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO'S HAVING TO PAY. FOR HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTS A MONTH- I DON'T KNOW. I CAN'T GET MY ARMS AROUND THE FACT THEY WERE OVERCHARGING SOME. WHO NEED PHARMACEUTICALS TO BENEFIT OTHERS. THAT'S WHAT'S GETTING ME AND MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WORKS. ACTUALLY THIS IS AN OF JOHN LEWIS FROM TROOPER PARR SOMEONE ELSE INSURE BURKE IS ON THE PHONE- TWO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ADDRESS THAT QUESTION OF DOCTOR CENTER. OKAY WE DO HAVE ANYONE FROM THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS REVIEW PROGRAM ON. BLIND. SO WHAT I WILL SAY WHICH SORT OF CAME OUT OF THE RIVER ANALYSIS- IS THAT IN THIS IS A AS IT RELATES TO INSULIN WHICH IS A COMMON DRUG THAT MOST PEOPLE NEED THAT MANY PEOPLE NEED- SO INSULIN HAD AN 80% REBATE OFF THE LIST PRICE THAT WAS PAID FOR BY THE PBM. AND SO RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU NEED IT- YOU'D BE PAYING AT THE PHARMACY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR THE INSULIN. SO IF THIS WERE TO GOING TO AFFECT YOU WOULD ONLY BE PAYING A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS SO MY UNDERSTANDING AND I AM VERY NEW TO THIS SPACE BUT IT IS IN THIS WORLD IS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND HAIRY- AND- TRUTH BE TOLD PATIENTS ARE IN A CHOKEHOLD- BETWEEN. PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS AND INSURANCE PLANS- AND THE PBMS WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS THAT THIRTY SIX OTHER STATES ARE TRYING TO EXTRICATE THEMSELVES FROM THIS CHOKEHOLD AS IT RELATES TO REBATES BECAUSE THE REBATES WERE DESIGNED. TO GO TO THE PATIENT OR THE CUSTOMER NOT TO THE PBMS AND SO THERE HAS BEEN THERE I KNOW THERE ARE ARE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT. I GUESS LATE PRICE BREADING ARE SHIFTING THE COST TO GO TO SOMEONE ELSE SO THAT THE PPL ESSENTIALLY YOU CAN RECOUP THE COST THAT YOU WOULD BE LOSING. THEM IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS WERE TO GO INTO A FACT AND THE INFORMATION THAT WE GOT WAS THAT AID THE SAVINGS HAVE BEEN UNDER ESTIMATED THROUGH CHIPPER. BUT IF THERE WERE TO BE A PRICE INCREASE IT WOULD BE LESS THAN POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO I'M CERTAINLY ONLY. MEANS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND I THINK YOU KNOW WITH THE AT RESPECTFULLY TO THE OPPOSITION THERE'S BEEN NO CONFLATION OF A LOT OF ISSUES BECAUSE YES THE COST OF HEALTHCARE IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND YES THE COST OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS IS INCREDIBLY HIGH. AND YES REBATE GOING DIRECT. TO THE PATIENT OR TO THE CUSTOMER WHO NEEDS THAT- I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAN GET ADDRESSED AND I KNOW THAT YOU ALL PROBABLY ADDRESSED ALL OF THOSE ISSUES IN VARIOUS FORMS WITH PIECES OF. LEGISLATION THAT COME BEFORE YOU. WELL THANK VERY MUCH YOUR RISK YOU CERTAINLY ANSWERED MY QUESTION AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL SIX. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- I'LL TO GET PROMOTION YET. OKAY IT'S BEEN MOVE A CENTER LEYVA- THIRTY COME EITHER AT THE END THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF- TO ADDRESS MANY ISSUES- INTERVIEW TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH- THE OPPOSITION. AS WELL- TO DRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY RAISE BUT AGAIN THAT YOU I THINK THAT THERE ARE. WHAT I GUESS MAYBE SHORTHAND I'D SAY IS THAT. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY WELL THERE ARE. TWO GROUPS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME OVERALL. IN TERMS OF ON THE PREMIUM SIDE THERE MAY BE SOME UPWARD PRESSURE. BUT ACTUALLY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY NEED THE MEDICATION- THE ABOUT COST SHARES YOU SAID RIDICULOUS MORE DIRECTLY TO THEM ACTUALLY DECREASES. SO IF YOU'RE THINKING INSURANCE SHOULD REALLY HELP YOU WHEN YOU'RE SICK. THE SERVER HEADS IN THAT DIRECTION- BUT OBVIOUSLY IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAT BUT I'M SORT OF GETTING THE SHORTHAND- SO CERTAINLY I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL. WITH THE AMENDMENT SAYS THAT YOU ACCEPTED- WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. IN A MINUTE KEEP IT SHORT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE AND I JUST WANNA BLESS ALL OF YOU ALL FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO ON THIS COMMITTEE- BUT IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. ALMOST FOURTEEN MILLION PATIENTS COULD BENEFIT BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN TIME FOURTEEN MILLION FOLKS WILL BE NEEDING TO FILL A PRESCRIPTION. ALMOST NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS IN CALIFORNIA TAKING BRAND DRUGS AND ARE IN PLANS WITH DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE AND SO THEY WOULD BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED WITH LOWER COSTS. AND FOUR POINT ONE MILLION PRESCRIPTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FILLED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD BE MADE MORE AFFORDABLE. I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THIRTY SIX OTHER STATES ARE LOOKING AT BILLS THAT CAN ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE REBATES ARE GOING TO THE PBMS AND NOT TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM MOST PEOPLE THAT WERE. LOVE AND CARE FOR. WHO AT SOME. ANOTHER I NEEDING TO FILL A PRESCRIPTION. AND WHEN THE STATE'S AREN'T ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO ACTUALLY THE SUPREME COURTS HAVE STEPPED IN- TO ALSO SORT OF. TAP DOWN ON. WHAT MANY PEOPLE SAY SOME GROSS NEGLIGENCE HAPPENING AROUND REBATES GOING TO THE WRONG PEOPLE. OR ENTITIES SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- SO- THE BOSTON. THE BELLS THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE FIRST. AMENDED REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- IT'S BEEN SECONDED BY CENTER LEYVA. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE BALL HAS. TO GO HAND IN. HAND HI MELINDA'S.

THE TIME RUNS OUT THE FOURTH ONE IT WILL STOP THERE AND THE FIFTH ONE CAN SIMPLY SAY THAT THEY'RE AN OPPOSITION LIKE A THAT SELF JUST WANT PEOPLE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE USER. SO THAT WE CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH THE PRESENTATION FROM THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL COMES ON BURKE AND EGGMAN- PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU- A MISS. I WILL TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE AN IMPRINT. THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT REYES DHEAS FOR THEIR HARD AND BENEFICIAL WORK ON THE BILL- TODAY AND JOIN WITH JOINT AUTHORS SENATOR EGGMAN AND THIS COMMITTEE KNOWS BETTER THAN PERHAPS ANYONE ELSE IN THE LEGISLATURE- THAT CENTER EGGMAN HAS BEEN BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE LEGISLATURE A CHAMPION WITH RESPECT TO THOSE WITH MENTAL. ILLNESS UP. CANACCORD IS A PROPOSED FRAMEWORK SPONSORED BY GOVERNOR TO DELIVER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE MOST SEVERELY IMPAIRED CALIFORNIANS THOSE SUIT TOO OFTEN LANGUISH SUFFERING IN HOMELESSNESS OR INCARCERATION. AND- IT IS ALSO. IF FRAMEWORK TO SUPPORT THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WERE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL THE FAMILIES THE KNOW THE ANGUISH OF LOOKING FOR A LOT OF LOVE WANTED FOR IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY CAN'T SLEEP THE FAMILIES THAT KNOW THE ANGUISH. OF RECEIVING A PHONE CALL IT MIDNIGHT IN ACTUALLY HOPING IT'S FROM THE JAIL VERSUS THE HOSPITAL. THE ANGUISH OF WONDERING WONDERING WHAT THE NEXT STEPS GOING TO BE THE ANGUISH OF THINKING THINGS HAVE GONE WELL AND FINDING OUT THAT PERHAPS THEY HADN'T GONE AS WELL AS ONE WOULD HOPE- THE- THE RESPONSE THE- FOR INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS FOR IN A INDIVIDUALS WERE SUFFERING WITH UNTREATED. SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM INSIDE CAL PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS ALL HOUSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES FACE HIGH RISKS FOR REPEATED HOSPITALIZATION INCARCERATION INSTITUTIONALIZATION MENTAL HEALTH CONSERVATORSHIP AND PREMATURE DEATH A COMPREHENSIVE CARE MEDICATION HOUSING HAVE BEEN CLINICALLY PROVEN TO SUCCESSFULLY TREAT AND STABILIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. WHAT ARE TOO OFTEN- AVAILABLE ONLY AFTER RESTORE IN SECURE FACILITIES THERE FOR S. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY IT WILL CREATE A PROGRAM TO CONNECT A PERSON IN CRISIS. WITH COURT ORDERED CARE PLAN. TO TWELVE MONTHS WITH THE ABILITY EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER TWELVE MONTHS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES INDIVIDUALS WITH A CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY BASED SET OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT ARE CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY COMPETENT. THIS INCLUDES SHORT TERM STABILISATION MEDICATIONS WELLNESS AND RECOVERY SUPPORTS AND CONNECTION TO SOCIAL SERVICES INCLUDING HOUSING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A JOURNEY OF THE JOURNEY THE LEGISLATIVE JOURNEY BEGAN YESTERDAY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CONTINUES TODAY BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL MORE STEPS IN THE PROCESS AND THE CHAIR AND I HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION I KNOW TEACHERS DISCUSS WITH OTHERS. SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL AND WE EXPECT THE BILL WILL IMPROVE AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS- THE CONCERNED CONCERNING HOUSING IS ONE. WE ALL SHARE THESE DRESSED- BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THIS DOES NOT DO. CARE COURT IS NOT A CONSERVATORSHIP THERE IS NOT A IT'S NOT A SUBSTITUTE. OF FOR THE DECISION MAKER FOR THE FOR THE PERSON WHO IS. ILL CARE COURT DOES NOT CREATE A PATH TO OPPRESS CARE COURT IS A CIVIL COURT NOT A CRIMINAL COURT CARE COURT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR FORCED INVOLUNTARY MEDICATION. CARE COURT DISPENSED CANNOT BE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NOT ARREST THEM IF THEY DO NOT COME TO COURT. CARE COURT DOES NOT INVOLVE SECURE FACILITIES. CARE COURT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY RIGHTS DUE PROCESS IS PROTECTED SELF DETERMINATION IS OFFER A NEW PARADIGM IT OFFERS A- NEW- NEW TOOL. TO ADDRESS THOSE SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL AND WHO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TODAY WE HAVE- DR MARK GALLI SECTOR CALIPHS FOR CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DR. ALEX COUPLE WHAT'S OF PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY IN A BIO BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AT UCLA IS ALSO MEDICAL DIRECTOR SAN FERNANDO. MENTAL HEALTH CENTER AND CHIEF OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE SISTERS TO XIN ALL OF YOU MEDICAL CENTER AND FINALLY CRISTINA ROB.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SARAH BURKE'S ENTERTAINMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M VERY HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY WITH. THAT WAS CENTER- BERG. OUR OUR DAY TO OF- OF TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL WITH OUR WITH OUR COLLEAGUES- YOU ALL YOU PROBABLY MORE THAN ANY OTHER COMMITTEE HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT MY A BILL PACKAGE AND- HAVE SEEN FROM THE BEGINNING FROM INTERVENTIONS. ALL THE WAY TO THE VERY END A CONSERVATORSHIP WE ARE TRYING TO FIX AND REPAIR OF FRAGMENTED AND BROKEN MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. OTHER I. AM LEADING FULLY INTO THAT AND HOPEFULLY YOU AGREE THAT MY FIXES WORLD WILL IMPROVE THE SYSTEM. BUT WHAT I CANNOT DO AS AN INDIVIDUAL LEGISLATOR OR WHAT CENTER- BERGEN I CANNOT DO IS CREATE THIS WHOLE NEW. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS COME UP WITH- TO MY ROLE AS BUDGET CHAIR I'VE BEEN ENGAGING WITH DOCTOR GALLEY FOR. FEELS LIKE I GUESS YEARS NOW- AROUND THIS ISSUE ABOUT A NEW PLAN A NEW PARADIGM A NEW WAY OF DOING THINGS- WE PASSED LPS LAWS AND IN NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN. LORD KNOWS- OUR WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE TROPICS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT. A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES- JUST THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. RUSTIC WHICH- IS ANYBODY SITTING IN THIS. THIS HASN'T BUT SO AT SOME LEVEL WITH A FAMILY MEMBER WITH A SEVERE PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH OR KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS OR HAS NOT TOUCH. JUST NO IT DEPENDS OUT WE A PROBLEM WITH HOME AND MEANT HEALTH ISSUE AS THEY AS THEY AND THE NOT EVERYBODY WAS HOMELESS HAS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES NOR NOR CONVERSELY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A- A POPULATE. ONE SEVEN TWELVE THOUSAND THAT THIS BILL WOULD APPLY TO AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT FORCED THIS IS A NEW PARADIGM OF INVITING PEOPLE INTO A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. AND HOLDING OUR SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE YOU ALL HEARD WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SETTING IT DOWN TO OUR SYSTEMS AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO HOLD THE SYSTEMS AND OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND. I THINK THE DARK CONSTITUENTS EXPECT MORE- ON THE STREETS DESERVE MORE. SO WITH THAT- ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THIS WITH THE OPEN HEARTS AND MINDS AND I WOULD INVITE THE CHAIRED INVITE UP OUR FIRST WITNESS RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH COURSE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF- WILL BEGIN WITH A- DOCTOR MARK ALL THE SECRETARY OF.

AND WHERE THEY ARE IN TERMS OF THE SPEAKING BUT- AND I KNOW THE OTHER TWO IN THIS IS DRAWN THE LINE SO- SEPARATELY. WELCOME THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. SENATORS EGGMAN AMBERG. THANK YOU FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. TIM O'CONNELL DEEPLY COMPASSIONATE PHYSICIAN AND FOUNDER OF BOSTON'S HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAM IS REFERENCED IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ARTICLE TITLED LIBERTY VERSUS NEED OUR STRUGGLE TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. IN THAT ARTICLE DR O'CONNELL TELLS THE STORY OF A WOMAN HE ENCOUNTERED WHO LIVED ON A STOOP FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS BUT WOULDN'T ALLOW THE OUTREACH TEAM TO GIVE HER A SANDWICH OR SOCKS. WOMEN INCESSANTLY WHENEVER SHE WAS APPROACHED ONE DAY SHE BECAME SO WHEN WE WERE IN SICK THE POLICE BROUGHT HER TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. AND SHE WAS ULTIMATELY CONSERVE. O'CONNELL RAN INTO WERE YEARS LATER AT A MEETING AT A NONPROFIT. SHE WAS A BOARD MEMBER ALL DRESSED UP IN TOTALLY TRANSFORMED. YOU LOOK FABULOUS HE SAID. AND SHE SAID SCREW YOU SCREW YOU. YOU LEFT ME OUT THERE FOR ALL THOSE YEARS AND DIDN'T HELP ME ONE BIT. TODAY CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIANS HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE. KEEP TALL IN SUPPORT OF CALIFORNIA SICKEST. CANACCORD REPRESENTS ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO STAND TALL WITH AN ESTIMATED SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS STATEWIDE CARE CORE CLINICAL CRITERIA PROVIDE A NARROW ENOUGH GROUP OF CALIFORNIANS WHEN WE CAN ABSOLUTELY MEET THE NEED TO MAKE A LOT ONTO MAIN DIFFERENCE. TAKE A MOMENT DIFFERENT YESTERDAY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS I HEARD THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THOSE WHO OPPOSE CARE COURT. FIRST WHY DO THIS THROUGH THE COURTS LET'S BEGIN BY THE TRUE REALITY OF WHERE WE ARE TODAY THE COURTS ARE OFTEN IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF THE LIVES OF THOSE SUFFERING FROM SEVERE DECOMPENSATED MENTAL ILLNESS. OFTEN IT'S THE CRIMINAL COURTS AND NOT THE CIVIL COURTS CAN ONLY AFTER WE WALKED BY INDIVIDUAL SCREAMING OUT FROM THE STOOPED I MEAN TIME AGAIN. THE CRIMINAL COURT PATHWAYS ARE NOT AN ENVIRONMENT FROM ANYONE WITH IMPAIRED JUDGMENT FOR INSIDE. DOES DISEASE SYMPTOMS MAKE EVERY NEW VOICE EVERY NEW SOUND A FURTHER DISORIENTING CHALLENGE. THE CARE CORD IS A VEHICLE FOR COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION NOT JUST COMPLIANCE SECURE CORE PROCESS CAN BE PROTECTIVE SUPPORT OF SUPPORT OF PLACE THAT WILL START WITH A PERIOD OF ENGAGEMENT CALL THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN THE LEGISLATION ALLOWING FOR THE CURE CORPORATISM IN TO WORK WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO ARRANGE A COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLANS. IF OVER A SIXTY DAY PERIOD THE CARE PLAN. CAN BE COMPLETED IN ON THE ROAD IMPLEMENTATION THE COURTS ONGOING INVOLVEMENT MIGHT BE SMALL. IN THE CASE EITHER BECAUSE OF THE KIND OF THE CLIENT CAN'T PARTICIPATE OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES CAN'T IMPLEMENT INAPPROPRIATE CARE PLAN THAT'S PERSON CENTERED THE COR WILL DEEPEN ITS ENGAGEMENT IN OVERSIGHT. ALSO WE ARE NOT TOUGH ASKING JUDGES TO BE CLINICIANS WE ENSURE THAT THE JUDGES HAVE CLINICAL SUPPORT TO DO THE WORK- THAT IS NECESSARY. SECOND ISSUE FROM YESTERDAY. WHAT ABOUT THE WELL DOCUMENTED IN EQUITIES IN CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS AND THE COURT SYSTEMS WE HAVE TODAY. THESE ARE ISSUES WE SHOULDN'T AND DON'T TAKE LIGHTLY WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THESE REALITIES. AND ADDRESS THEM IN THE FORMATIVE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM. WE WILL NOT CHANGE THE SYSTEMS OVERNIGHT BUT WE CAN MAKE BIG IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN ENSURE STANDARDIZED TOOLS FOR ASSESSMENT AN EVALUATION A REVIEW BY MANY WITHIN HI FOR AMELIORATING. THESE FEATURES THAT DRIVE IN EQUITY. WE CAN TRAIN INDIVIDUALS. PARTICIPATING IN THE CARE COR PROCESS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A KEEN AWARENESS OF THESE DRIVERS OF INEQUITY AND THEIR OWN ROLE IN PERPETUATING THEM WE CAN INVEST IN A- SINISTER. OF ROSS IS IN THE CARE SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN APPROVE THEM ALONG THE WAY WE CAN IN A ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS FOR NOT JUST. IN THIS FORMATIVE DAYS OF THE CARE COURT PROPOSAL BUT REGULARLY AS THE PROGRAM IS DEVELOPED FOR THE YEARS TO COME. THIRD WHY THE SET OF DIAGNOSES AND ARE WE AWARE OF THE RACIAL INEQUITIES IN DIAGNOSING AND TREATING TREATING SCHIZOPHRENIA. IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES FIRST THE NEAR YOUR NEAR OR SET OF CLINICAL CRITERIA IS MEANT TO FOLLOW THE EVIDENCE. WE KNOW THAT THE INTERVENTIONS PROPOSED IN CARE IN THE CURRENT CORE MODEL CAN WORK FOR PERSONS SUFFERING FROM THESE ILLNESSES. FIFTEEN TREATMENT APPROACH THE MEDICATIONS THE COMMUNITY BASED HOUSING WE ALSO KNOW THIS APPROACH DOESN'T WORK FOR EVERYONE SO IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE TRIED FOR EVERYONE. REGARDING THE ISSUE OF RACIAL INEQUITIES IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF THESE CONDITIONS THIS IS REAL AND MUST BE FRONT OF MIND WE SHOULD CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE DEBILITATING ILLNESSES. IMPACT DIFFERENT GROUPS DIFFERENTLY AND HOW WE CAN BE SURE OUR CLINICAL PROCESSES NOT JUST PARKOUR PROPHECIES ACCOUNT FOR THESE UNDERSTANDINGS AND FURTHER THEM UP FOR THE NOT FOR LEARNED OR STANDING. FOURTH WHY ISN'T THE HOUSING REQUIRED. LOOK THE REQUIREMENT FOR A HOUSING PLAN ALLOWS. THE HOUSING PLAN ALLOWS THE NEED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE YOU INCLUDED INTO THE OVERALL CARE PLAN. THAT SAID LET ME BE CLEAR AS THE CO CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA'S INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS I KNOW WE KNOW THE LEVEL OF RECENT INVESTMENT. IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS AND ADDITIONAL PROPOSED INVESTMENTS THIS YEAR- TOTAL WITH FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WITH ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OF THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED GOVERNOR BUDGET DEDICATED TO BEHAVIORAL. BRIDGE HOUSING- THAT IS MEANT TO TARGET EXACTLY THE POPULATION CAR THAT COULD BE CARE CORPORATIST OFFENSE. BEFORE CLOSING I WANT TO HAVE ASK A QUESTION OF MINE. AS A CLINICIAN WHO IS LED HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS FOR THE HOMELESS IN SKID ROW IN LOS ANGELES AND THROUGHOUT THAT. PROBATIVE OVERSEEN JAIL HEALTH SERVICES BOTH IN THE ADULT SYSTEM AND THE CHILDREN SYSTEM. WHO HAS STARTED AND SUPPORTED DIVERSION PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHO ARE CAUGHT UP IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. I ASK WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT SO LONG. WHY MUST WE WAIT UNTIL THE BOTTOM HAS FALLEN OUT. THE CHARGES FILED IN THE ARREST IS MADE WHAT IS HE MADE ABOUT THAT. WHERE IS THE CIVIL IN THE APPROACH TO CIVIL LIBERTIES I KNOW THIS IS A HARD ISSUE BUT MAYBE IT'S MY CLINICAL BENT MY UPSTREAM IS TO HOPE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE ONLY SYSTEM THAT IS CAPABLE AND WILLING TO SERVE OUR SICKEST HAS BARS IN FRONT. THAN COLD WALLS ON THE SIDE. WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE STEEP AND THE RETURN ON THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE QUICKLY SWALLOWED TO THE LACK OF ANY INCURRING COMMUNITY KNOW THIS IS A HARD ISSUE FOR MANY OF US AND- THESE ARE CHALLENGING THINGS TO CONSIDER I THINK TODAY JUST LIKE YESTERDAY AND TOMORROW AS WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE AND A COMMITMENT FOR ME TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU ARE THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU. AND IMPORTANTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS ARE THOSE WHO TODAY OPPOSE- THIS CONCEPT THIS FRAMEWORK BUT THAT WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND THAT THOSE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION WILL REMAIN OPEN AND THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT EVERY ASPECT OF THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE WE PUT THE CALIFORNIA WAY FORWARD. A STRONG AND COMMITTED WAY TO THE SICKEST OF THE SICK ON OUR STREETS- SO WITH THAT- THE PLAN I THINK IT DR ALEX CAPELLO WHAT'S TO FOLLOW. THANK YOU- TOM MODERATOR FREE IS FREE ON TO THE LINE WE FOR START WITH- DR ALEX COUPLE IT'S THAN US AND THEN ALSO FOLLOWED BY CRISTINA ROOP I SHOULD JUST MENTION FOR THE TWO OF YOU- YOU HAVE ESSENTIALLY TWO MINUTES AND EIGHT SECONDS REMAINING FOR BOTH OF YOU SO JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND- THE START WITH DOCTOR. HELLO IT'S- GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS IS ALWAYS THE BALLOT. PLEASE NEARLY YES PLEASE BEGIN. OKAY I WAS THE COACH IS WORKING WITH THE SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL OF LOS ANGELES FOR THE PAST THIRTY FOUR YEARS FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS I'VE BEEN THE CHIEF OF PSYCHIATRY AT ALL IF YOU USE DELAYED MEDICAL CENTER WHICH IS ONE OF THE THREE PUBLIC HOSPITALS L. A. COUNTY WITH A PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. WE RECEIVE ABOUT FIFTEEN PATIENTS A DAY ON- OVER THE YEARS I'VE WITNESSED THE RAVAGES. BECAUSE OF. AND RELATED. MULTIPLE THOUSAND PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. CHARLIE I THINK MANY OF THESE SAME PATIENTS VITAL TO THE ER. BROKEN OFTEN WITH THEIR EXASPERATED PARENTS. RELATED STORIES OF THEIR ILL RELATIVES EXPERIENCING OVERWHELMING FOR CHRONIC SYMPTOMS. INSPECTIONS ARE BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL USUALLY UP SOMETHING GATORS THE CURTAINS THOSE BROTHERS. BUT THEN GET BETTER WITH APPROPRIATE CARE INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE. OF MEDICATION. AUTOCRINE MANY PATIENTS GET MUCH BETTER WITH TREATMENT BUT I THEY READ TO IT'S NOT THEIR MED. BECAUSE THEY THINK CARE AND OF THE PART OVER. WATCHES HAVE IS HARD. I DON'T HEAR TO EXPO ABOUT HER SOME WILL. A EPISODE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED TO YOUR TO. MY FOCUS IS ON THAT WE- THAT IS MEANT HEALTH IS. FOR DOING THE STATE AND THEIR- BY NOT PROVIDING THEM WITH ADEQUATE TREATMENT WHEN THEY NEED IT AND FOR AS LONG AS THEY NEED IT. ILLNESSES SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA OR DISEASES THAT IMPACT DIRECTLY ON THE BRAIN. THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR THAT THE LONGER A PERSON GOES UNTREATED THE WORST LONG TERM OUTCOME OF THE CONDITION. THAT MEANS GETTING PEOPLE THE CHEAPER THAN KEEPING THEM IN TREATMENT IS OF THE UTMOST PRIORITY ISSUE WITH NOT ONE IS DOUBLE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HELP PROFESSIONAL I BELIEVE A PATIENT- MOUNTABLE RIGHT SHOULD BE ACCESS TO ATTIC TREATMENT. WISHFUL THINKING AT BEST IN GROSS NEGLIGENT AT WORST TO EXPECT THAT A PERSON WITH SEVERE PSYCHOSIS WILL BE ENCOURAGED OF WHAT IS BEST FOR HIM OR HER. THE REASON IS THAT ALL TOO OFTEN THESE PATIENTS LACK MEDICAL DECISION MAKING TO PASS. THE WORD TO THE ALMOST IMPAIR. UNDERSTAND BENEFITS AND RISKS OF APPROACH TREATMENT. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING CAPACITY IS NOT AN ABSTRACT NOTION IT COULD BE RELIABLY IS BEST. WAY TRAIN COULDN'T. ME FISHING MISTER UNDERSTOOD OF THIS THE- OCT THIRTY TIMES TO COME.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MY NAME'S ANDY. ACTOR OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I'M ALSO A LAWYER WHO'S BEEN LIVING WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER FOR THIRTY TWO YEARS. AND YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN SAY AND I WAS HERE YESTERDAY AS WELL AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATED- SENATOR ON BRUCE COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AS BILL AS TO OF ALL AND I APPRECIATE. SECRETARY DOLLARS COMMITMENT ON THAT AS WELL. FUNDAMENTALLY IF THIS IS A RECOVERY AND EMPOWERMENT ARE AND THE E. AND CANACCORD. THE BEST WAY TO DESIGN A NEW FRAMEWORK THAT'S GOING TO GET TO RECOVERY AND EMPOWERMENT. IS TO TALK TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECOVERED. AND ARE LIVING GOOD LIVES WITH LONG TERM MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING SKITS OF. AND CONCERN UP UNTIL THIS POINT IS THAT THAT VOICE HAS NOT BEEN PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PROPOSAL THERE ARE FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS OPPOSING THE PROPOSAL. ALL OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE BILL AS IT WAS WRITTEN WHAT. FROM SEPTEMBER IS THAT IT'S INTENDED TO BE COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY THAT NOBODY WOULD BE FORCED TO PARTICIPATE IN CARE COURT. BUT WE ALSO HEARD THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS AND THAT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ELIGIBLE TO BE REFERRED KARAKUL. NOT HAVE INSIDE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES SO IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR TO ME HOW CARE RECORD IS GOING TO BE VOLUNTARY. AND HOW THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE ANY FORS IF IT'S A COURT ORDERED CARE PLANS AND THE PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO IT OR BEING REFERRED BY OTHER PEOPLE PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BE. IN THE COURT ORDERED CARE. WE TAKE SENATOR UMBERG GOT HIS- THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT FORCE TREATMENT IT'S NOT ABOUT FORCED MEDICATION. WE THINK THAT IF THAT'S TRUE. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOT LESS. BUT RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT'S JUST NOT CLEAR. THE POINT ABOUT HOUSING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. IT'S THE PEOPLE ON THIS COMMITTEE KNOW THAT THERE'S A- MOVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AROUND THE COUNTRY. LOTS OF GOOD EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS IF YOU DON'T HAVE STABLE HOUSING WHATEVER ELSE TO DO THIS. BEFORE ON HOUSES NOT LET IT BE LONG TERM EFFECTIVE SO I WILL. TURN IT OVER TO DR GENERAL WARREN WHO WAS ON THE PHONE THANK YOU. EIGHT WATER PLEASE BRING GINA WARREN FROM NEIGHBORHOOD WELLNESS FOUNDATION ON. THE LINE COUNTY. AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CO FOUNDER YOUR EDUCATION WE ARE. OUT OF HIGH- WHERE YOU'RE A FIFTY AMOUNT OF- INDIVIDUALS WELL AS NEIGHBORHOODS- COMMA I CAN'T WRITE ANYTHING RELATIONAL TRAUMA- MANY BANDS WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR EXPERIENCES AND I DON'T THE STORY BECAUSE EXPERIENCE IS IMPACT OVER MY FROM PHYSICAL HEALTH- AND CORRELATE. SO WHAT WE WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IN OUR OPPOSITION THAT. HAS FIFTY ACRES BURNED STATED THAT THEY NEED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. TO CUT BUT IT'S A LOT OF HELP. IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT BECOMES. AND SEVENTY ARE OUTSIDE OF THEIR PERFECT EIGHT OFTEN OFTEN- YOU TO A LOOKING IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY PLANS WHEN ASKED AND THE DIAGNOSIS. IS NOT INTIMATE. AND THAT'S FINE YOU CAN'T CONFIDENCE IT'S THREE AND UNDERSTANDING. EFFECTIVE PRINT. BE ABLE THE COURT COURT. TELL AND I AM FINALLY IF AS- EFFECTIVE DIRECTOR AT. YES AND AT THE CLINICAL PHARMACIST MADE UP IN AND BEFORE IF I THANK YOU FOR MUCH I WILL NOW MOVE TO. I THINK IN PERSON THE CALL MENDOZA ATTORNEYS TWO YEARS WORK OUT OF STOCK I WAS BORN AND RAISED A SINGLE PARENT A PERSON WITH BORDER PERSONALITY DISORDER AND SURVIVOR POLITICS SEXUAL ABUSE IN RECENT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE I SEN- FOOD OUT OF TURN- STATIONS AND SUICIDAL ID. I SHARE THIS WITH YOU ALL BECAUSE THIRTEEN THIRTY EIGHT WILL SET US BACK DECADES IN ADVANCEMENTS MADE IN MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. INSIDE IN JUDGMENT OR NOT MAGICALLY CAME THROUGH SHOULD CATION AND CERTAINLY NOT IN IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE TREATMENT. FIRST BECAUSE THE COMPLETE TRUST THEIR ONLY FOR. THESE ARE THE ACT OPPOSITE CONDITIONS WHICH LEAD TO HOPE AND EMPOWERMENT FURTHER IT IS AEROMEDICAL ANSIBLE TO IMPULSIVELY DIMINISH CIVIL RIGHTS OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DURING TIMES OF WAR. AS ANALOGOUS TO THE EUGENICS MOVEMENT PROMINENT UNITED STATES AT THE SAME TIME **** GERMANY WAS LEGALLY MURDERED PEOPLE WITH BILITY. HUNDREDS THOUSANDS FROM. NINETEEN FORTY NINE FORTY. THE TREATMENT. OPTIMIZED WHEN I AND THE ADVERSE IMPACT PEOPLE OF COLOR COLOR WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES. FURTHER IT OPENS THE DOOR TO DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AS IT WILL ALLOW FOR AN ABUSER OF A PERSON WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION TO WEAPONIZE THAT PERSON'S DISABILITY AGAINST THEM INSTEAD LEGISLATORS SHOULD BASE PAY ALMOST OUT REACH WORKERS PEERS AND MY PROFESSIONALS. FUND MORE OF THEM THE WHOLE WORK OF ESTABLISHING TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CALIFORNIANS LOSE ON THE STREETS. OF THE SERVICES TO THEM. EIGHT AND PRESERVE ACCESSIBLE DEEPLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LACK OF HOUSING IN ADDITION TO SYSTEMIC RACISM AND ABLEISM ARE THE TRUE ROOTS OF OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND UNLIKE WHAT HAPPENED HERE PLEASE INVOLVED HOMELESS PEOPLE AND PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN YOUR PROCESS IN CLOSING AS A SISTER TO A PERSON WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY AND AUTISM WHO GREW WITH STEP IN STOCK WITHOUT ANY SERVICES I UNDERSTAND. ISOLATION IN DEATH. FAMILY FEEL THINKING THIRTY ONE DISABILITIES BUT WITH A HEAVY HEART I IS FIT IS THE NOT A- AND I CAN YOU FROM SERVING ON HOUSE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS FOR MANY YEARS THAT WE ARE SAYING. OLD AS- WE'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS THE PERSON WHO MLESTED ME AS A CHILD IS MY UNCLE DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA HE LEFT OUR FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS AND WE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DEAD. WE RECENTLY LEARNED THAT HE IS ALIVE DUE TO AN OUTREACH WORKER IN NEW MEXICO AND- FOUND OF AN ENCAMPMENT ESTABLISH TRUST AND HE IS NOW IN HOUSING WITH SSI BECAUSE OF MY- EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION. I WOULDN'T WISH- COURT EVEN ON HIM THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO MICHELLE CABRERA FROM COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SISTER ACTORS ASSOCIATION YOUR PRESIDENT PERSON OKAY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS MITCHELL COVETED OUT AND I'M SPEAKING ABOUT TURNS ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY OF A WHOLE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THAT. YEAH A LOT CYCLE. IT WOULD CREATE FAST REFERRAL. FOR FAMILY MY AND- COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO EXPAND OUR PUBLIC SAFETY NETS REACH THIS INCLUDES MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES NOT YET ENGAGED IN SERVICES. AND THE TENANT SEVEN OUT OF TEN CALIFORNIANS WITH PRIVATE COVERAGE. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST CONSIDERATION OF OUR CONCERNS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ONE WE NEED MORE DIVERSE AND MORE ACCESSIBLE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR OUR CLIENTS VIA CARE COURT. OUR CLIENTS ARE OFTEN SCREENED OUT OF HOUSING WERE TOLD TO GET TO THE BACK OF THE LINE IF THERE ARE HELPING AVAILABLE TO BEGIN WITH. FOR FULL IN BILLION ALL INVESTED INTO HOUSING TO BE BROUGHT INTO CARE COURT WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS INVOLUNTARY SERVICES TODAY WHO ARE ANNOUNCED WITH HOUSING PLANS WAITING FOR HOUSING. TWO WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SINGLE WORST WORKFORCE CRISIS OUR SECTOR HAS EVER EXPERIENCED IF WE TRY TO ABSORB A SIGNIFICANT NEW EXPANSION OF SERVICES WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES WE WILL NEED TO DIVERT CLINICIANS TO ON REIMBURSABLE TIME SPENT WAITING IN COURT. OUT IN THE FIELD LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO ENGAGE THEM INTO TREATMENT PLANNING AND OTHER COURT MANDATED ACTIVITIES INCLUDING TRANSPORTING THEM BACK AND FORTH TO COURT. DO THEY WILL NEED MORE STATE AND SOME BONUSES WE WILL NEED TO INCREASE SALARIES TO ATTRACT NEW STAFF AND KEEP THE ONES WE HAVE. WITHOUT NEW FUNDING. WILL HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF SHIFTING RESOURCES FUNDING AND ATTENTION AWAY FROM KIDS AND PREVENTION. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A FULL BLOWN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WE CANNOT AFFORD EITHER OPTION. WITHOUT ANY NEW FUNDING WE ALSO WORRY THAT THE CONCEPT OF FINES AND RECEIVERSHIP WOULD ONLY HURT OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET. IN THE WORST CASE SCENARIO WE COULD BE PLACED UNDER RECEIVERSHIP AND DIVERT RESOURCES AWAY FROM CORE MEDICAL SERVICES INCLUDING CHILDREN. CLEAN UP IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT CONCEPTS LIKE QUALIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE DEFINED AND ALIGNS ITS SCOPE OF PRACTICE. TO REMOVE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW ELIGIBILITY BASED ON A NON CLINICAL REVIEW OF RECORDS WITHOUT MEDICAL SCREENING. TO ADDRESS HEALTHCARE COURT WORK FOR DRUG INDUCED PSYCHOSIS WHERE MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT THE PRIMARY CONDITION OR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR WHOM CAL IN IS MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO REMOVE STIGMATIZING DIAGNOSES. FINALLY THE BILL AS DRAFTED WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERMINE OUR GROUND IN PARITY LAW WHICH SENATOR WIENER AUTHORED AND WE WOULD MEAN TIGHTENED SIGNIFICANTLY TIGHTEN CLOSE OF THOSE LOOPHOLES.

YOU'RE QUITE I HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE AT KIND OF CHIME IN- SO FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK MANY OF US UNDERSTAND IS THAT THERE IS A HIGH NEEDED TO ADDRESS- IN SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES WITH A MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BUT WE ALSO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROGRAMS WE DON'T HAVE IT BEING NOT HAVE ENOUGH- STAFF MEMBERS WHETHER WE LOOK AT THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR THE PUBLIC SECTOR. LIST ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT AS I HEAR THIS IS THIS BILL COME FORWARD I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE WANT HOW WE PLAN TO NAVIGATE THAT PARTICULAR CHALLENGE THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS NOT ENOUGH PROGRAMS NOT THAT YOU KNOW ENOUGH OF THE VERY MUCH AND WE'RE ADDING A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM TO THE LAST. ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE ESPECIALLY FOR THE COUNTIES IS THAT THEY WILL AB THE BILL DO I BELIEVE THEY WILL DO THIS AND I'M WORKING AWAY BUT I'M THINKING WHAT ARE THE TO PULL STEP OFF OF IN ORDER EIGHTEEN PRIESTS AND THE NUMBER OF HEALTH ISSUES AMONGST OUR- YOU KNOW UNDER EIGHTEEN THE SUICIDE RATES OUR SCHOOLS ARE ASKING FOR MORE I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH ALL OF THIS AND JUST WANTING TO KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO PLAY IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA PLAY OUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT AND- SO I WILL SAY THIS IS THIS IS NOT IN ISOLATION THIS IS IN CONTEXT OF ALL THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THEN YOU KNOW WE LAST YEAR WE- FUNDED PLATFORM TO BE ABLE TO DO IT- MIDDLE HEALTH EVALUATION OF A CHILD. ZERO THREE TWENTY SIX. THE BEER. WHO THIS NOW WE'RE FUNDING AT. POINTS BILL DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS UP SEVENTY PERCENT. FROM WHAT IT WAS JUST A FEW YEARS AGO- WE INVESTED TWELVE BILLION DOLLARSLAST YEAR. ON HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND ANOTHER. TWO BILLION THIS YEAR FOR BRIDGE HOUSING- AND- IN THE ADMINISTRATION KNOWS AND PLANS ARE. INCLUDING MORE CAUGHT. AS IT'S GOING TO BE TO PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND HOUSING- IT COMING UP IN THE MAY REVISE. I SAW. ARE NOT. THESE ARE CLIENTS ALREADY THEORETICALLY BEING SERVED BY OUR COUNTIES ALREADY BEING THEORETICALLY BEING SERVED AND IS TECHNICALLY LIKE SAY. MOSTLY WE'RE PUTTING THEM TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN IN LINE BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A BUNCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SERVE AND IT'S EASIER JUST TO LEAVE THEM- I WOULD THERE'S A DOCTOR HERE WITH HE'S GONNA TESTIFY LATER BILL NYGREN ARTICLE BY HER. EARLIER THIS WEEK SHIA STREET MEDICINE DOCTOR ABOUT GOING OUT AND SEEING PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALMOST BEING ABLE TO PREDICT WHO'S GOING TO DIE NEXT.

WE ARE WE THINK KNOWLEDGE AND IT WILL BE A MORE HISTORIC AMOUNTS OF MONEY COMING IN FOR OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE IT LOOKS FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE IS A HUGE ISSUE BUT I WILL ALSO SAY JUST ON THE BURNOUT OUR STAFF LEVEL IT'S SO HARD TO SEE. ACTIVE SYSTEM. SO HARD TO SEE PEOPLE YOU. HELP AND DESPERATELY WANT TO. THAT CREATES BURNOUT AT A HIGHER LEVEL THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN BEING ABLE TO KEEP OUR FOLKS. IN THE FIELD ENGAGED IN DOING THIS KIND OF VERY IMPORTANT WORK. WE HEARD TODAY FROM OUR PUBLIC GUARDIANS. ABOUT THEY ARE NOW THEIR CASELOADS ARE HUGE AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO THEM MUCH LATER. MUCH MORE ISSUES WITH WITH DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY FROM LIVING ON THE STREETS. MUCH MORE ISSUES AND MUCH MORE. IT FEEL PEOPLE WHICH AGAIN CAUSES. BURNOUT TO OCCUR AT HIGHER RATES- SO WE FULLY INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FUND WE HAVE SENT HISTORIC AMOUNTS DOWN I UNDERSTAND. THE COUNTIES- NERVOUSNESS IN RESERVATIONS BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS COMING WITH A LOT OF- OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY THOSE TO THESE FOLKS WILL HAVE TO BE. AND AGAIN I'LL SAY IT TOO IN A COLLABORATIVE NON FORCED. CONTINUOUS ENGAGEMENT KIND OF WAY TO GET EVERYBODY TO CREATE THIS PLAN TO GO FORWARD- SO I CANNOT ANSWER EVERY SINGLE QUESTION LIKE EXACTLY. BUT THAT'S IN THE CONTEXT THAT THIS PLAN COMES FORWARD IN AND AGAIN WITH THE ECOLOGY MEANT. THAT THERE WILL BE A PUBLIC DEFENDER THERE WILL BE. A CASE MANAGER THERE WILL BE THE SUPPORTER. BE THE JUDGE AND THEN THE COURSES THAT ARE ABLE TO BE PULLED. AND AGAIN ALSO IN THE CONTEXT OF CALAMP CAL AIM IS OCCURRING AT THE SAME TIME ALSO WERE THE PLANS WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE FUNNY. FUNDING TO PAY FOR HOUSING AS WELL. THIRTY GO DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING OR- OKAY. WHAT WORKFORCE IN HOUSING IN THE TO BE AT OFFICE. YES AND THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE NEXT ONE WAS ON HOUSING- IN ANYTHING. AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW DOCTOR GALLEYS EXPLAINED THAT. HE HEARD IT LOUD AND CLEAR YESTERDAY- AND THAT IS DEFINITELY A PIECE- THAT ACTUALLY A THINKER COMMITTEE. BROUGHT UP TO AS A AS A PIECE THAT'S MISSING IN THIS AND CERTAINLY ONE FOR ME RIGHT THERE THE- THEY GO HAND IN HAND AND I THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT COUNTIES PROVIDE IT YOU KNOW. THE DEAL A NUMBER OF SERVICES AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED I THINK SOME- HE YOU KNOW PROGRAMS- AT THE CITY LEVELS THAT INCLUDE HOUSING WITH SOME STATE FUNDING AND THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- IT BUT I THINK ABOUT THE COORDINATION AND WHAT'S IT'S GOING TO MEAN WHEN- YOU YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH I MEAN AND WE KNOW THAT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT- AND WE WILL. ACTIVE PROGRAM SO YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL THINK ABOUT HOUSING BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT A LITTLE BIT MORE MEAT ON THE DIRECTION THAT YOU THINK. SO OR THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU WILL BE ASKING AS THIS BILL GOES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN RELATION TO COORDINATING HOUSING AS- A COMBINATION- TO THIS STRATEGY. OKAY I WOULD I WOULD POINT TO. A THE WHAT I WHAT I ALREADY WENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE SENT DOWN AND I KNOW THERE ARE- WE PERFORM THE THIRTEEN BIG MAYORS. IF THEY WANT TO HAVE DOUBLED I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK OUR OUR BODIES CERTAINLY AGREES WITH THAT- I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT KIND OF A- AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WERE TALKING TO SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND. NOT ALL OF THESE PEOPLE IS NOT TO BE ONE SIZE SAW RIGHT THEY'RE NOT ALL GOING TO GO TO A BED ED- YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAID THE GOING TO BE A LOCKED FACILITY KIND OF BY DEFINITION IT WILL NOT. BE IN A LOCKED FACILITY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON LPS AND NOT GONNA BE IN THERE AND IT'S NOT AN ACUTE SYSTEM WITH THE- DEVELOPING IS A SEPARATE ON RAMP. TO OUR SYSTEM THAT IS NOT A CUTE BUT IS MORE COLLABORATIVE DECIDE WHAT KIND OF HOUSING THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE BECAUSE IT COULD VERY. BUT ALSO IF JUST LIKE. WITH CHILD WELFARE. IF SOMEBODY IS IN A- SETTING WHERE THERE'S MORE SUPPORT A FAMILY MEMBER. IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ALLOW THAT PERSON TO LIVE AT HOME. OFTENTIMES FOLKS HAVE. FAMILY STILL THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY LIVE WITH. FAMILIES HAVE HAD TO DRAW LINES WHEN BEHAVIOR IS OUT OF CONTROL. AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUPPORTER RESOURCES. I THINK YOU HEARD FROM A- LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS TODAY TO. WHO WOULD WELCOME SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO THEY COULD THEN BRING THEIR ADULT CHILD BACK HOME POTENTIALLY. OR HAVE OTHER. SITUATIONS SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL. BUT AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A- PRETTY SMALL. A POPULATION OF PEOPLE. IN THE- FORTY MILLION STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LET ME JUST. OF RESPOND TO THE- HOUSING QUESTION- ALL THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED WHETHER IT'S THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE OR THE ADMINISTRATION OR THE AUTHORS AND MY GUESS IS THE COMMITTEE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT HOUSING IS A KEY COMPONENT IN STABILIZATION. AND THE CHAIR AND I HAD A CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN CONNECTION WITH CARE COURTS- WE'RE WE'REINVESTING A LOT OF MONEY IN HOUSING WHETHER THOSE ARE IN CARE COURTS HAVE FIRST PRIORITY OR HOW WE- NOPE IS FOLKS WE PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHELTER AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT THAT WILL DIE TEARS GONNA RAISE THIS POINT JUST A MINUTE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF YOU'RE NOT COOPERATING IN CARE COURT WHAT IF YOU HAVE A LAPSE WHICH IS GOING TO HAPPEN. BOB DOESN'T MEAN YOU LOSE YOUR HOUSING THE ANSWER TO THAT IS IF THERE'S A LAPSE NOW- THERE HAS TO BE SOMEONE THOUGH WHO MAKES DECISIONS AND WE NEED TO SORT OF DEFINE WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR INTER MINUTE LAPSE. OR ATLEAST GET SOME CLINIC. OR COME GUIDELINES TO SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT. THE PERSON MAY THE DECISION IS THE JUDGE- BUT- WE THIS THIS IS NOT A MEMBER BUT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY. BUT IT IS AN AMENDMENT THAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH AND RECOGNIZE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I THINK THIS IS IT YOU KNOW I TAKE THIS AS BEING ONE OF THE FIRST A- POLICY COMMITTEES THAT IT'S GOING THROUGH AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK I THINK IN BOTH HOUSES AND MEMBERS FORMALLY AND INFORMALLY I MEAN THIS IS BEEN. THERE'S BEEN CHATTER ABOUT THIS IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY UP BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE IN TREMENDOUS NEED. TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO CALIFORNIANS TO FOLKS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT BUT IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THAT THIS CAN BE COMPLICATED IS NOT LOST ON ME. THAT AT. THIS MODEL MAY NOT WORK FOR ALL AND THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE COMING BUT OUR MAIN CONCERNS OF HOW WE'RE GOING MAKE THIS WORK UP. YES I KNOW YOU KNOW OTHER COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO HAVE A LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS. I THINK VERY IMPORTANT AND NEEDED ISSUE. THANK YOU SIR ALONE CERROS. THING WAS FOR SURE YOU KNOW- GIVEN THE CRITICALITY OF THE ISSUE INVOLVED HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. TRIAL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOL CHEST AND IT CERTAINLY APPEARS TO ME THAT THAT'S WHAT THE- CUT THE GOVERNOR IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE DOING HERE AND I THINK OF. THE GOVERNOR AND THE MINISTER. BENDED FOR DOING SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S SOME ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF- OF AREAS- BUT- WE'VE ALL HEARD FROM OUR COUNTIES BOTH AS TO FUNDING AND OTHER ISSUES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO. DEPEND ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE INDICATED THAT IT INTENDS TO. PURSUE APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM AND IT IS VERY IS OF VERY SERIOUS- BUT OF COURSE WE HAVE A PART IN THAT TOO HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE SO. WE'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THIS PROPOSED WE NEED TO ENGAGE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE GOVERNOR. TO PURSUE THAT AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT. AFTER BUDGET CHAIR IN THOSE OF. YOU WHO ARE BUDGET SUB CHEERS WILL WILL PURSUE THAT- YOU KNOW AS NECESSARY THE ONE OTHER AREA THAT COUNTIES AT LEAST THE COUNTY THAT. THAT I WORK IN- IS RAISED IS IN THE AREA OF SANCTIONS- OF COURSE. THIS PROGRAM AS HA BEEN INDICATED DEPENDS ON THE ON ADEQUATE FUNDING FROM THE STATE AND OTHER AREAS AND ALSO STAFFING. SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE SANCTION PROVISION OF THE BILL AND IT SAYS. YOU KNOW IF AT ANY TIME DURING THE PROCEEDINGS THE COURT FINDS A COUNTY IS NOT COMPLYING WITH COURT ORDERS THE CULPRIT MAY. FIND COUNTY UP TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DAY FROM NINE. THE QUESTION THIS. THAT GIVES SOME OF THE ISSUE FUNDING AND STAFFING OR MAYBE OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE COUNTY SHOULD WE NOT CONDITIONED THE AVAILABILITY OF SANCTIONS ON THE ADEQUACY OF STATE FUNDING AND STAFFING SUPPORT OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE SHOULDN'T WE CONDITION THE AVAILABILITY OF SANCTIONS. A SHIP OF INTENT INTENTIONAL NOT PLANTS. WITH THE PROGRAM. JUST COULD. ARREST ARTICULATED TAKEN COME ON UP IT IS REALLY THE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED- OKAY BUT BUT ONE OF THE RULES OF THE JUDGE IS ALSO TO USE DISCRETION HERE AND YOUR POINT CENTER ROTH ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE UNAVAILABILITY OF SOME RESOURCE THAT YOU CAN'T BASICALLY. GET BLOOD OUT OF A STONE THAT THE POINT IS WELL TAKEN UP IN WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES SO THAT IT SAY- FULLISH ANNALYNNE DISCRETIONARY ACT ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY NOT TO PROVIDE IN ORDER TO BE ORDERED TO DO SELF AND I'LL LET DOCTOR GET RESPOND PRESS SECRETARY ALEX YEAH. TO ROB. THE QUESTION DEEPLY BECAUSE THE LIGHT IT'S BE SPOKEN BIT ABOUT YESTERDAY BUT NOT MUCH TO IS A ABOUT A- ON TO SIDES. WE FOCUS ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE CLIENT BUT AN IMPORTANT PART OF CARE CORD IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY ON GOVERNMENT. TO DELIVER FOR SOME OF THE SICKEST CALIFORNIANS. SENATOR I MEAN YOU MENTIONED SO. END OF IT. THE PARTICIPANTS GIVEN THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT. GIVEN THE RESOURCES WE BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA COUNTIES CALIFORNIA CITIES. CALIFORNIANS ARE THE ENTITIES WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SERVE. SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS CAN COME TOGETHER TO DELIVER ON ALL COMPONENTS OF A CARE CORE PLAN. YES I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MIGHT BE SHIFTING AND MOVEMENT OF STAFF TO MAKE SURE WE DELIVER THOSE SERVICES. BUT AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE MAKING SURE THIS POPULATION MOVES TOWARDS THE FRONT OF MIND TO GET THEIR SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE. SUPPORTIVE CARE COURT I WONDERED IF WE COME TOGETHER CAN BE DONE SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS AGREE WITH SENATOR UMBERG THE DISCRETION BUT THIS CONCEPT SAID IF WE REALLY PUSH OURSELVES TO SERVE THIS POPULATION WELL. WITH THE COMPLETE PLAN THAT INCLUDES THE TREATMENT SIDE IN THE HOUSE INSIDE THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST COUNTIES BUT CITIES AND OTHERS. SO THE HOPE IT OF COURSE BUT COMING TOGETHER PRIORITIZE AND FOCUSING ON THIS POPULATION AS CLEARLY AS INTENTIONALLY AS POSSIBLE THE BILL SANCTIONS WON'T EVER COME INTO PLAY AND THAT PATTERNS OF CHALLENGES CAN BE ADDRESSED OVER TIME TO MAKE SURE THE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE WE KNOW THIS IS AN EASY. BUT THIS IS NECESSARY AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS YOU KNOW A DIFFICULT PART OF THIS CONVERSATION BUT AN IMPORTANT WELL YOU KNOW FOR LAWYERS AND I KNOW THE ALTARS WON'T. ACTUALLY OCCUR A LAWYER WHICH I DON'T CLAIM TO BE. BUT FOR LAWYERS THE TERM NON COMPLIANCES ABSOLUTE. AND WHILE THE COURT MAY HAVE DISCRETION I THINK AS WE MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AND I PLAN TO SUPPORT IT- WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE OF COUNTIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT THEN THERE'S PROBABLY SOME REASON TO BE CONCERNED. AND THERE PROBABLY ARE WAYS TO BUILD OFF RAMPS AND THE LANGUAGE OF TO BE TO FURTHER DEFINE- CONDITION NON COMPLIANCE SO THAT IT'S OBVIOUS IF THE COURT IS FACED WITH A SITUATION WHERE THE COURT IS EXERCISING DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE- THE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE FINE. THAT THE COURT ALSO MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING. AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING SUPPORT FROM THE STATE- AND STAFFING SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM WORK THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT- SENATE ROTH IT'S COME IT WILL TAKEN OF. THERE IS- NEARLY. THE DISCRETION HAS TO BE WHERE A ENTITY OF ITS OWN VOLITION DECIDES NOT TO USE RESOURCES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AVAILABLE- THERE ARE SOME GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES WE'LL VERY FEW IN CALIFORNIA WHO WHO MAY NOT BE COOPERATIVE IN MAINE MAKE A DECISION NOT TO BE COOPERATIVE THOSE OF THE ENTITIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY MAY END UP FACING SANCTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS MISTER. THANK YOU SERRA CERTAINLY VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER PAM- I APOLOGIZE I HAD TO STEP OUT TO GO TO THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD MEETING- CITED MISSILES LITTLE BIT OF MONEY BUT I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- ALREADY THAT I FULLY SUPPORT THIS AND I WILL BE VOTING I TODAY AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHORS AND TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. WERE GOING FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW ISN'T WORKING AND SO WE DO HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ARE THE QUESTIONS I HAD ON PAGE TWELVE OF THE ANALYSIS THERE ARE- SIX POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS THAT- IT ASKED HE AUTHORS TO CONSIDER I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH ALL SIX FROM TODAY BUT I DO THINK THAT THEY ARE GOOD SUGGESTIONS AND WE JUST ASK THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THEM AS THE BILL MOVES. HOW LONG DOES IT. TO THE A COURT ORDERED PLAN I KNOW IT TALKS ABOUT THE FOURTEEN DAYS BUT WILL IT HAPPEN IN FOURTEEN DAYS. AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION IS. WILL THE COURTS BE PREPARED FOR THIS THAT'S THAT MIGHT BE AN ONSLAUGHT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. HOWEVER WELL I CAN START THE LAST ONE FIRST LOCUSTS DOCTOR DELHI TO- RESPOND- WILL THE COURTS BE PREPARED WEL THAT'S THIS IS A UNIQUE MODEL THAT INVOLVES ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND CERTAINLY JUDICIAL COUNCIL I AM INFORMED THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS FULLY AWARE THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE- ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR THE COURTS CREATES A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE AS WELL ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES IS TRAINING FOR THE JUDGES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT TYPICALLY WITHIN THE SKILL SET UP A JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO. THE SUIT IS THAT OUR HELP SIDE ALL CRIMINAL PROCEDURE CIVIL PROCEDURE AND SO THAT'S- IT HERE IS THE RAINING IN IN THEIR A COLLECTION OF BEST PRACTICES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT WE ALSO NEED TO GATHER. ON THE DOCTOR PRODUCTOR GALLAGHER OF THE LEAF TECHREPUBLIC ALL STATER IS THE QUESTIONS GET HARDER THAN HIS FATHER REALLY EXPERTS. IT WAS SO REALLY TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THE CARE PLAN IN FOURTEEN DAYS WE KNOW THAT TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE YOU HEARD. A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TESTIMONY AROUND MAKING SURE THAT IF. THE TREATMENT CAN BEGIN EARLIER WE KNOW EVEN RECENT EVIDENCE AS OF THIS MONTH AND- THE LAST TWO MONTHS DEMONSTRATING THAT THE SOONER INDIVIDUALS CAN GET ON EFFECTIVE TREATMENT THE MORE LIKELY THAT- THE COURSE OF THE DISEASE IS BETTER OVER TIME. AND UP- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF BEING CLIMB WITH MEDICATIONS IS STARTING YOUR MEDS AND TAKING THEM SO THOSE THE THAT THAT'S AN ASPECT THAT. THE HOPE IS OF COURSE. JEAN DE. IT'S LIKE. AND IT'S MEANT TO BE IN ORDER TO PUT SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT MATTERS AND WORKS. THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU DR KELLY AND I JUST AGAIN WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO EVERYONE INVOLVED THIS IS SUCH A BIG ISSUE. AND WE'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY PET PARENTS AND FAMILIES OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE SENATE- JUST ABOUT HOW HARD THIS IS AND HOW PAINFUL IT IS. AND I WOULD ALSO CAUTION AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO NOT LET PERFECT GET IN THE WAY OF GOOD. AND LET'S DO SOMETHING GOOD FOR THE PATIENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU LEYVA- RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE- A CO AUTHOR IS HERE- FOR THIS MEASURE AND I. DON'T WANT TO RE ITERATE WHAT EVERYONE SAID AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF OUR COUNTIES AND LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES HAVE CONCERNED IN AND THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS TO BE ADDRESSED BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. WELL THIS BILL TO MOVE AGAIN I KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED AS WELL AS THE AUTHORS AND WORKING ON THOSE LINGERING CONCERNS I EAT CLEARLY THERE HAS BEEN COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION TO. YOU KNOW TO TACKLE THE FUNDING ISSUE AND WE'VE BEEN INVESTING A LOT OF MONEY IN THE PASTURES THAT PERTAINS TO HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH IN FACT THE AUTHOR HAS A PACKAGE OF A MENTAL HEALTH BILLS IN AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DEAL WITH THIS IS YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE DEALS WITH YOU KNOW PERSON. COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE THAT HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS ARE OUT ON THE STREET OR HAVE DIED ON THE STREET DUE TO HOLD ISSUES AND THEY WERE NOT% ABLE TO GET THEM HELP HIS BOSS HAD A YOUNG LADY WHO BROKE DOWN PROFESSIONAL U. S. C. WHO IS SAYING THERE WAS JUST. TYPE GEN I THINK THAT CREATE SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA HOPE TO ALL THE FAMILIES IS IN PART BUT WE WANTED TO AND I DON'T HEAR ANYONE SAYING THEY'RE NOT COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS IT IS AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH BUT AT THIS POINT DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION THE PROBLEM IS NOT GETTING SOLVED OUR STREETS CONTINUE TO GROW IN TERMS OF KNOW AND AS THE TIME TO. AND SO THEY ALSO VERY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH STATION AS WELL AS THE AUTHORS AND I AM A CO AUTHOR. AS WELL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS A TIME THAT TIME IS NOW AND MORE THAN EVER NOW THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY. RESERVE I THINK THAT THE COMMITMENT IS THERE TO GET THIS DONE TO FIND WHAT WE NEED TO. INSIDE INSIDE BRING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS GATHER. HOW TO CREATE A PLAN THAT'S EFFECTIVE AND I AM ALSO VERY COMMITTED SO WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YES SIR WITH MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SENATOR EGGMAN AND CENTER AMBER GRAVES SO MANY QUESTIONS- I WILL START WITH THE SECOND PAGE OF THE BILL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT THERE WITH YOU KNOW OKAY- SO IT SAYS. HI THE BILL WOULD. WELL I'M LOOKING THE PART HERE IT SAYS IF THE RESPONDENT IS ORDERED TO COMPLY WITH THE ONE YEAR CARE PLAN BY THE COURT IN SO. I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS IN THE BEGINNING TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM BUT THE BILL TALKS ABOUT IT- ORDERED BY THE COURT TO HOW DO YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION WOULD YOU. YOUR DRAW STRAWS TO SEE WHO ANSWERS IT- I'LL START ATDOCTOR DELHI- CORRECT ME- BUT SO. WITH WITH THEM AS AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW BETTER THAN NIGHT WHEN SOMEONE HAS A- SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS SCHIZOPHRENIA IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT THAT. FROM THAT POINT FORWARD THEY DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS- IF SOMEONE FOR EXAMPLE SAYS LISTEN HERE HERE'S THE PLAN THAT I'M AGREEING TO HERE'S- HERE'S WHAT. I WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN WHILE IN THE CARE COURT PROGRAM THEY CAN AGREE AHEAD OF TIME. AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME IT THEY HAVE A TREATMENT PLAN AND THEY FILLIT OR THEY- ALL PHILIP BUT BUT- YOU ARE CONTINUALLY INCAPACITATED OF DOCTOR GALLEY WELL IT'S JUST IT SAYS IF THEY'RE ORDERED TO COMPLY WITH IT SO RIGHT. NOT A VOLUNTARY ONCE ONCE THEY'VE AGREED THEN THAT IS THE GREED UPON PLAN. I AM WHAT SECRETARY ALSO THAT- YES THANK YOU BUT HOLD ON ONE SECOND I JUST. I WANT TO BE CLEAR IN THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE SAYING AS LONG AS THEY AGREED TO. ACCEPT THE PLAN. BUT THE BILL SAYS. THE BILL WOULD ALSO SPECIFY THE SCHEDULER REVIEW HEARINGS REQUIRED IF THE RESPONDENT IS ORDERED TO COMPLY WITH THE WHEN YOUR CARE PLAN SO THIS IS THEIR ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN YOU'RE AYING THEY WOULD VOLUNTARILY COMPLY WITH THE PLAN BUT- NO. WAY IS SO IF. IF I AGREE THIS IS THE PLAN. YES AND THEN I DON'T COMPLY WTH THE PLAN AND THEN I'M ORDERED TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN THAT I'VE ALREADY AGREED TO AT THE END AND I HAVE THE CAPACITY DECIDE I'M NOT GOING TO COMPLY THEN YOU CAN FAULT ONE OUT OF COMPLIANCE OUT OF THE PROGRAM OKAY- YOU'RE SAYING THAT HE- FELT. I DON'T SEE IT OUTLINES THE BILL WORD SET. YOU ONLY IF YOU PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO COMPLY WITH THE PLAN IT DOESN'T OUTLINE THAT IN SENTIMENT IS. A LEAD DOCTOR GALLEY SORRY MORE COMPLETELY EXPLAIN. SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION OF. THE THERE'S TWO IMPORTANT PIECES HERE WHEN I'M SORRY COULD YOU STEP JUST YOU'RE VERY TALL BUT COULD YOU STEP CLOSER AND MAKE IT WORK AND YOU HEAR ME BETTER NOW. YES OKAY- THERE IS REALLY TWO COMPONENT I WANT EXPLAINED WHEN A REFERRAL IS MADE. ONE OF THE FIRST AND- THE POTENTIAL PARTICIPANT IS DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THE CARE COURT PROCESS. ONE OF THE FIRST. STAGES IS. WHAT WE ARE. PUT IN THE IT'S MENTIONED IN THE LEGISLATION AS THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THIS PERIOD OF SIXTY DAYS. WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL WORKING WITH THE COUNTY CAN COME TOGETHER AND CREATE A CENTRALLY A CARE PLAN. THAT IT WOULD HAVE ALL THE THREE COMPONENTS THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THE CARE TEAM. MEDICATIONS HOUSING AND THAT THE COMING TOGETHER AND PUTTING THAT PLAN IN PLACE- IN THOSE SIXTY DAYS AND THEN HAVING IT BEGIN TO BE IMPLEMENTED- IN A- IN A REALLY VOLUNTARY WAY COUNTY PROVIDES. SERVICES CLOSING SOURCES COME TOGETHER IN THE VARIOUS ENTITIES THAT HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL COMPLIES INCOMES TOGETHER AGREES TO THE PLAN THE COURT INVOLVEMENT OVER TIME WILL BE. LAST AND THE SENSE OF AN ORDER. MONITORING REALLY LOOKS VERY DIFFERENTLY IF THERE ISN'T AN ABILITY TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE CARE PLAN IN THE SIXTY DAYS. THE COURT WOULD COME BACK. BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE- TO GETTING THAT CARE PLAN TO. COMING APPROPRIATE AND THEN- WHETHER IT'S ON THE SIDE OF THE GOVERNMENT ENTITY THAT NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL DIFFERENT SERVICE OR ON THIS SIDE OF THE PARTICIPANT TO THEN MONITOR THE INVOLVEMENT AND ENGAGEMENT IN THAT PLANT SO IT REALLY STARTS OUT THAT PER SIXTY DAY SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT I LIKE TO CALL IT ENDING. IS REALLY MUCH. YES IN THE CARE COURT PROCESS BUT IT STARTS OUT WITH THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHERE INDIVIDUALS CAN. REALLY FILL IN AND BUILD THE PLAN THE OTHER COMPONENT IN THE PLAN OR THE WHOLE PROCESS THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT TODAY IS THE ROLE OF A SUPPORTER. BUT SUPPORTER IS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONG WITH THE FROM A LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR THE CLIENT THAT WILL WORK WITH THE CLIENT. THE IDEA HERE IS WE AREN'T WORKING NOT CONFINEMENT WERE LOOKING A COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT ART SUBSTITUTE DECISION MAKING WE'RE LOOKING AT A SUPPORT OF DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND NOT SUPPORTER WORKING WITH THE CLIENT- WITH THE INDIVIDUAL. CAN BRING THE WISHES THE INTENTIONS THE DESIRES ENSURE THAT THE HOUSING SOLUTION THAT IS PROPOSED ONE THAT. NEEDED IN. AN OVERTIME TAKES THAT INTO ACCOUNT THAT HAS AN INDIVIDUAL POTENTIALLY STABILIZERS ON MEDICATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY THE COMPONENTS OF THE CARE PLAN WOULD CHANGE OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. BUT THE IDEA IS THAT IN THAT FIRST YEAR. THE PARTICIPANTS WOULD THREE. CORE MONITORING WOULD ENSURE FULL DENTAL CARE PLAN IS DELIVERED TO THE INDIVIDUAL. I HOPE THAT HELPS. TO THE QUESTION. WELL I SEE SIXTY DAY REF IN HERE THE SIXTY DAY STATUS CONFERENCE SHALL BE FOLLOWED BY REGULAR STATUS COMES IS SET BY THE COURT AT LEAST A HUNDRED. EVERYONE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS- THAT IS. FOR A COURT APPROVAL AND THE CARE PLAN BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE ANSWER MY QUESTION ABOUT THE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY NATURE OF THIS PLAN AND- I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN ANSWER THAT BUT IT JUST I'M NOT SEEING ANYWHERE IN THIS BILL WHERE IT'S- NECESSARILY VOLUNTARY- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WHAT YOU OUTLINED OF SOMEONE SAYING OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT I NEED SOME HELP AND I'M GONNA AGREE TO THIS PLAN THEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING ABOUT IF THEY RENEGE ON THAT BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT AGREED TO A PLAN JUST WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS HERE AND RIGHT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT. SO- I THINK THE RIGHT WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT- INTERESTED OR NOT COMING FORWARD IN FONG WORKING WITH THE COUNTY THE COURT ON THE PLAN- THEY WOULD FALL OUT OF THE PROGRAM IN THAT INDIVIDUAL HOPEFULLY WE CONTINUE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUAL FIGURE OUT WHETHER THERE'S SOME OTHER OPTIONS BUT- YOU. WE ON THE SORT OF NORMAL COURSE THAT WE SEE TODAY SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE BEEN RECENTLY UNDER FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLDS IN A HOSPITAL THERE VULNERABLE TO GO BACK INTO THAT PROCESS AND DONNA CONSERVATORSHIP PATH WE KNOW THAT MANY INDIVIDUALS END UP ENCOUNTERING LAW ENFORCEMENT MAYBE ARE CHARGED AND ARRESTED PLACED IN COUNTY JAIL IF IT'S A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY. MAYBE IN TRIAL A DEFENDANT AND THAT HAS ITS OWN PATH SO THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER PATHS THAT THE INDIVIDUALS VULNERABLE FOR THAT CARE COURT THE PROCESS OF CARE COURT- REALLY REMOVES THEM OUT OF THOSE SITUATIONS. AND SO WILL THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT. COMPLYING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE CARE CORP PLANT IS THAT THOSE EXISTING PATHWAYS THE TOOLS THAT EXIST TODAY COULD COME INTO PLAY DOWN THE ROAD FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THE WHOLE IDEA OF CARE CORD IS TRY TO. PROVIDE THE PROGRAM A SYSTEM THAT OF US GOING DOWN THOSE OTHER PATHWAYS AND SO. IN THAT SENSE THE INDIVIDUAL HAS THE FULL RIGHT TO SAY NOT GOING TO COMPLY AND THEN THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DOWN THAT PATH SO OUR HOPE IS THAT. ALLOWS IT SAID- MAYBE STABILIZATION ON MEDICATIONS WILL ALLOW IT THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL GET THE FULL PACKAGE OF SERVICES CAN BE ABLE TO BE STABLY HOUSED AND SUPPORTED IN THE COMMUNITY. OKAY SO LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THIS YOU HAVE. YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE SOMEBODY IN CUSTODY RIGHT. SO NOT NECESSARILY THAT THEY SHOULD BREAK BECAUSE I BECAUSE I THINK WHAT GOES WITH WHAT I HEAR YOU ASKING IS THAT IT'S IT SAYS IT'S WILL BE A COURT ORDER RIGHT AND SO THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT MEANS IT'SNOT VOLUNTARY. BUT DO YOU SEE WHEN YOU'RE ALSO IN YOUR READ THE BILL DO YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THERE THAT SAYS THEN THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU YEAH IF THEY'RE IN ELIGIBLE FOR DIVERSION I SEE THAT IN HERE OKAY THAT MEANS AND THEN WAS DR KELLY SAID THEN THEY WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE IT WAS TO. RIGHT ANY THESE PEOPLE HAVE SUPPORTERS WITH THEM. MANAGERS TRYING TO HELP THEM. SEE IF THEY CAN MAKE THOSE DECISIONS. IF THEY CAN'T. THEN THEY WOULD BE RIGHT THERE THERE THERE THERE WILL BE NO TIME WHERE SOMEBODY WILL SAY. THE COURT IS NOW TAKING YOU SOMEWHERE ELSE. RIGHT THE COURT IS NOW SAYING THIS. BUT IF YOU IF YOU REFUSE TO ENGAGE IN THE TREATMENT THAT YOU'VE AGREED TO. THE POTENTIALLY. YOU WOULD END UP IN THE SYSTEM. THAT WE TALK ABOUT. WHAT TIME OKAY. THIS BACK TO THE PROBLEM THOUGH RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO CAN'T. POSSIBLY KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM THAT'S WHY THEY'RE IN THE PREDICAMENT WE HAVE FIFTY ONE FIFTY FIFTY TWO FIFTY AND THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS. OKAY BUT THAT'S THAT HASN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM UP TO THIS POINT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE INTRODUCING THIS BILL- SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO JUST CAN'T MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES OR WON'T- AND THEN THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT THEY CAN DENY THEY CAN SAY NO I'M NOT INTERESTED. CARE CORD THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT WOULD BE THAT THEY JUST END UP RIGHT BACK IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND THEN RIGHT BACK ON THE STREET WHILE WHICH PUTS HIS BACK TO BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE. YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO- ZONE IN ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY. VERY VULNERABLE AND JUST CANNOT. MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS RIGHT. SO THAT THE STATE- SOMEONE WHO IS IN A CUTE SORT OF. PSYCHOSES WHO IS SOLUTION ON FOUND IN THE MIDDLE STREET AND CAN'T MAKE A DECISION THAT PERSON CAN'T MAKE A DECISION TO ENGAGING CARE COURT BUT THEY COULD BE ON A SEVENTY TWO HOUR HOLD DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME IT COULD STABILIZE SEVENTY TWO IS TOO SHORT I THINK BUT FOR A LONGER GOOD WHERE THEY'RE- STABILIZED ONCE THEY'RE STABILIZED THEY CAN START TO MAKE DECISIONS. BUT TO YOUR POINT- WELL WAIT DOES THAT I MEAN I'M SORRY DID YOU WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE FOR EXAMPLE PICKED OFF FROM UNDERNEATH THE BRIDGE IN BASIL PLACED IN THE CARE COURT WITHOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE CONSENT OR AWARENESS THERE OFF. I SUPPOSE I SHOULD LET DR KELLY FURTHER EXPLAINED BUT- I'M JUST THINKING OF YOU KNOW THAT THOSE WHO HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ISSUES ARE I MEAN. THEY JUST MAGICALLY RECOVER AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS PROBABLY NINE THEY'VE BEEN ON THE STREETS SO THEY DON'T THEY WERE GOING TO GET HER PLANNED SO- SO FAR. NO WE ARE. AND CAL. FIVE DEPENDING ON HOW YOU. START YOUR YOU MIGHT GO FROM. SEVEN TWO HOUR HOLD TO A FOURTEEN DAY HOLD EVEN A THIRTY DAY HOLD DOWN A TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS TO CONSERVATORSHIP THAT THE PATHWAY THAT. LOT OF CLINICIANS AN ACUTE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES MY MOVE A PATIENT DOWN INVOLVING THE COURT SYSTEM- NEARLY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY IF NOT ENTIRELY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THE IDEA HERE IS SOME PEOPLE TO STABILIZE. IF IT'S NOT SEVENTY TOWARDS FOURTEEN DAYS MAYBE THEN THE RELEASED AND RETURNED RIGHT TO THE SITUATION THAT THEY WERE IN BEFORE. ONE CONCEPT FOR CARE COURT AND WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE A COMMON REFERRAL PATTERN IS OUT OF. THE SITUATION INTO VICTOR COURT PROGRAM WHERE IN A MORE STABILIZE PATIENT PERSON FIVE CAN PARTICIPATE. MEET THE SUPPORTER WORK WITH COUNCIL COME TOGETHER BUILD THE PLAN THE CARE PLAN ALL THE COMPONENTS WE MENTIONED AND HOPEFULLY AVOID GOING DOWN. THE CAREEN TOWARD. MANY CLIENTS OF ARE EXPERIENCE SO- YOU KNOW THAT IS ONE ONE CONCEPT THAT WE THINK IS A VIABLE PATHWAY FOR THE CARE COR PROGRAM AND I THINK DEMONSTRATES HOW WE'RE MOVING YOU OUT OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS OFTEN ENTIRELY INVOLUNTARY WHERE DECISION MAKING IS SUBSTITUTED FOR CONFINEMENT I OFTEN THE- FINANCIAL SIDE OF PLACEMENTS INTO ONE THAT IS DEEPLY COMMUNITY BASED WORKS TO REALLY BRING THE DESIRES AND WISHES AS MUCH AS THOSE CAN BE CLEANED AND EVOLVED OVER TIME OF THE PARTICIPANTS INTO THE PLAN. AND FOCUS IS ON HOUSING- THERE'S A CORE PILLAR TENANT AND I WILL JUST LIFT UP ONE CONCEPT THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S ABSOLUTELY SORT OF THE ONE TWO PUNCH OF TREATMENT AND HOUSING YOU CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AND I THINK THE CARE COURT- FRAMEWORK REALLY PUSHES THAT FORWARD. SUCCESSFULLY OKAY IT'S. SO FIND I'M NOT GOING AND KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS I THINK THERE'S SOME. I'M NOT QUITE SURE I'M COMPLETELY CLEAR ON IT BUT YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB OF TRYING TO MAKE IT CLEAR SAID THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I WANT TO SHIFT NOW TO- WHO'S GOING TO EVALUATE. THIS PROGRAM AND THEN THE GUARANTEE OF WELL I'VE GOT THREE THINGS HE'S GOING TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAM. NEW ANY OF CARE SOMEONE ACTUALLY GRADUATES FROM THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I SEE I GUESS I SHOULD GET BACK TO I SEE THE BILL THAT IT SAYS THE CARE COURT- IT'S- A TWELVE MONTH PROGRAM. GUESS ADDITIONALLY INITIALLY AND THEY CAN BE EXTENDED A YEAR CORRECT OKAY N. PRESUMABLY THE- PERSON WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO CONTINUE FOR YEAR YES OKAY- AND THEY COULDN'T BE FORCED TO DO IT FOR TWO YEARS CORRECT OKAY MAKING SURE- SO. THE CONTINUITY CARE ONCE THEY GRADUATE- AND WHILE ALL INTEREST AT FIRST SO. HE WANTS TACKLE IT SERVICE- SURE I WILL. YOU KNOW THE CONTINUITY OF CARE- CONCEPT IS ONE THAT I THINK IS A DEEP PART OF NOT JUST CARE CORPORATE INDIVIDUALS WITH SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND WE HOPE AND EXPECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CARE CORE PLAN THE IMPLEMENTATION OVERTIME A YEAR MAYBE EVEN LONGER UP TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AFTER THAT PERIOD IN THE GRADUATION YOU MENTIONED THE BILL TALKS ABOUT DEAD THAT- CLINICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CARE TEAM. SAID THE HOUSING WOULD BE MAINTAINED BEYOND THE CARE COURT PERIOD NOT THAT SOMEONE GRADUATES AND GUESS WHAT YOU LOSE YOUR STABLE HOUSING PLACEMENT IN A COMMUNITY THAT YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO THE IDEA THAT IS THAT ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS WILL. WILL CONTINUE THE INDIVIDUAL WILL REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR- SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE HOPE EXPECTATION JUST LIKE WE DO WITH CLINICAL MEDICINE FOR JUST ABOUT ANY MEDICAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHRONIC CONDITION IS THAT THAT CONTINUITY WILL BE EXPECTED THE CLIENT OF COURSE CAN MAKE CHANGES AFTER THE CARE PLAN DECIDE I WANT PAYING. WHERE ARE MY CARE GROUP FROM ONE CLINIC ANOTHER. DOUBLE IN TWO TO AND SO I IS THERE ANY. EXPE DATE IF YOU WILL TO HOW LONG ONE COULD CONTINUE TO GET SERVICES ONCE THEY'VE GRADUATED THE PROGRAM THOSE SERVICES TO INCLUDE- ALL THE THINGS YOU LIST INCLUDE HOUSING. HERE SO YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT OF LONG TERM PERMANENT HOUSING IT IS ONE THAT WE ASPIRE TO AND BURKE I THINK THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS OP CONCEPT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- WE TALK ABOUT THE SUPPORT OF PART OF THAT HOUSING BUT THE PERMANENT PART IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT IS SO LONG AS- THE INDIVIDUAL AND IT IS. VERY HARD TO THANK FOR SOME QUALIFIES FOR CARE CORP WON'T QUALIFY FOR SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR QUITE SOME TIME EVEN POST GRADUATION THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE SERVICES. YOU KNOW PAID FOR AND SUPPORTED THROUGH MEDICARE ALL THROUGH A LOT OF THE FUNDS THAT. SO LONG AS THEY'RE ELIGIBLE THEY CAN MEANS IN THOSE CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS OF THAT ALREADY ESTABLISHED- INTO THE FUTURE BUT IT'S INDEFINITE. THAT'S SO LONG AS THEY QUALIFY THEY CAN. AND IT'S AVAILABLE IT IS YOU KNOW ITS ONGOING CONTINUOUS WILL JUST LIKE ANYBODY ANY CALIFORNIA SO FOR EXAMPLE A VOUCHER IF YOU IF YOU REMAIN POOR. THEN YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN- CERTAIN SUPPORT IF YOU HAVE HEALTH ISSUES IN YOUR MEDICAL ELIGIBLE YOU REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR CERTAIN HEALTH- SUPPORT SO WHAT WITH THE ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS BE FOR SOMEONE TO CONTINUE AFTER GRADUATION. TO RECEIVE- ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT ARE ENCOMPASSED IN THIS BILL SO. SO THE HOUSING COMPONENT RIGHT IF THE PROGRAM IS THERE THE IN THE SUPPORT IS THERE THE- CURRENT. SITUATION MANY OF OUR COMPANIES IS THAT INDIVIDUAL STAY IN THOSE UNITS WE HOPE AND SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO MOVE ON TO OTHER UNITS AND- MAYBE MOVE BACK WITH FAMILY OR OTHER SITUATIONS BUT SO LONG AS THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE UNIT IN HOUSING SITUATION. THE PLAN HOPE THEY STAY THERE AS FAR AS MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY TO PSYCH SENATOR- BURKE ARE REFERENCED IF THE PERSON MEETS THOSE CRITERIA THERE'S A LONG LIST OF PRICE. OFFERS HEALTH SERVICES SAID SO LONG AS THEY ARE MATT AGAIN IN MY OPINION IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO. QUALIFY FOR CANACCORD. S. FOR YOU AND YEARS TO COME WOULD NOT BE HEALTH SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD THEN. HAVE ACCESS TO THE FULL SUITE OF CLINICAL SERVICES INCLUDING. MEDICATIONS AS APPROPRIATE AS PART OF THAT SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH CARE IT'S NOT I DON'T ENVISION MANY CALIFORNIANS FAKING SCHIZOPHRENIA TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF SENATE ON OREGON LICENSE SUGGESTING THAT THEY WOULD FACE SCHIZOPHRENIC I'M TRYING TO GET TO THE HEART. OF THIS BILL AND UNDERSTANDING HOW THIS PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK- SO. YOU WERE SAYING THAT- THOSE WHO HAVE THESE TYPES OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS LIKELY IN YOUR EXPERIENCE ARE GOING TO HAVE THESE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR QUITE SOME TIME. ON THAT THEY DON'T. THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO GO AWAY AND THEY WOULD- BE ELIGIBLE FOR- YOU KNOW THE MEDICAL SERVICES OBVIOUSLY HOUSING ANYTHING ELSE COMES ALONG FOR. PRESUMABLY FOR. FAR INTO THE FUTURE SO I JUST I'M TRYING TO BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE FUNDING HAS TO GO ALONG WITH THIS AND IF WE ARE GOING TO- MAKE THE PROMISE OF SUPPORTING. THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE THEN. YOU KNOW DO WE HAVE THE RESOURCES IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT LONG TERM IT'S A GREAT WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE COMING INTO THE PROGRAM BUT WE HAVE SO MANY WHO ARE ACTUALLY AREN'T. LEAVING THE PROGRAM. CICERO I THINK THE BEST AN ORIGINAL APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TALK ABOUT SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THERE IS A CRYING NEED CITY TO MANY OF THE DIAGNOSES THAT WERE TALKING. THROUGH AND- YES THEY NEED. DELETE EVALUATED CONFIRMED AND THEY ARE BY CLINICIANS ON A VERY REGULAR BASIS IN OUR COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND PART IN THOSE EVALUATIONS INDIVIDUALS WILL CONTINUE TO EITHER MEET TO WERE NOT MEET THE DIE- DEFINITIONS AROUND SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THEN QUALIFY FOR THEM SO I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. ONCE DIAGNOSED IT IS IT POND. INDEFINITELY BUT THROUGH THOSE EVALUATIONS COULD TRAIN CLINICIANS IN TEAMS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WE EXPECT AND HOPE TO THE CARE CORPS PROGRAM WILL. REALLY UNDERSTAND AND KNOW THE CLIENTS OF THE WORKING WITH CAN MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS ON A CASE BY CASE PROFESSIONALS OKAY THANK YOU DR KELLY I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH- MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE. THE AUTHORS IS THE- ISSUE OF. YOU KNOW THE LAST JUDGES AVAILABLE. I KNOW MY COUNTY I MEAN WE'RE SHORT I THINK PROBABLY FORTY FIVE FIFTY JUDGES YOUR COMPANIES MAY BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION. BUTTON YOU KNOW WE ARE HAPPENING TO THEIR WORKLOAD THEY ALREADY CAN'T GET EVERYTHING DONE AND WE HAVE YOU DID WHAT JEFF THIS IS BEING DELAYED YOU KNOW. SO NOW IT IS FIT INTO THIS CURRENT SITUATION THAT WE HAVE SO- WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WAS SENT TO ROTH. IS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT CHALLENGES FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ONE IS CAPACITY- YES. THIS IS THANK. WORKLOAD INCIDENT SOME AND SIR JURORS. SO WE NEED INCREASED BUT NOT JUST BECAUSE OF. BUT ALSO THE SKILL SET OF JUDGES BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT- NATURALLY COMES FROM LEGAL TRAINING THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT NATURALLY COMES EVEN NECESSARILY FROM LEGAL EXPERIENCE. AND SO- HAVING JUDGES ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO. MONITOR THE SITUATION- B. IN ESSENCE SUPERVISING THE PLAN OF MAKING SURE THAT THE SUPPORTER IS DOING HIS OR HER JOB ADEQUATELY IS GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT'S PART OF THE PROJECT THERE'S THERE ARE GOING TO BE. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES THAT ARE DEVOTED- WE'RE WORKING WITH JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO ASSESS EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS- BUT BUT- I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED DO SO WELL. I HAVE YOU I MEAN. HAVE YOU WORKED THROUGH WHAT EXACTLY THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT WHAT SPECIAL SKILLS THESE JUDGES WOULD NEED AND THEN WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO COME FROM IS THERE. EDITION ON TRAINING THAT'S PROVIDED OR I MEAN. HOW'S THIS GOING TO WORK IT UP. THE I AM AWARE OF TRAINING MODULES THAT AE AVAILABLE BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT HAS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS AN INDEPENDENT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT- IF THEY AGREED TO- THAT. THEY HAVE AGREED THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT THE EXACT AMOUNT AND THE EXACT TRAINING HAS NOT BEEN- FLESHED OUT THIS POINT. OKAY- BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE EXPECTING RESULTS- YOU KNOW FROM. AT AND A BOLD- POLICY LIKE THIS ONE. ON THIS. I DON'T SEE IN HERE THIS THE APPROPRIATE NOW THE PREPARATIONS THIS WOULD GO INTO EFFECT- WHEN IS THERE ANY URGENCY ON THIS. IS NOT URGENCY BUILD BUT- THE ADMINISTRATION- AND WE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET THE FRAMEWORK IN PLACES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- I THINK WE'RE LOOKING FOR LEASE HAVING THE FRAMEWORK IN PLACE BY JULY ONE. WHEN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE JUST A FIFTH THIS FAR HAD IT WHEN WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE THAT THIS- HOLDING IS READY TO ROLL. WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW START. PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM AND START ASSESSING PERFORMANCE YES WELL IN AND HAVING THE JUDGES IN PLACE AND ALL THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS A PLACE AND- AND THE- HOUSING IN PLACE. SO AT THIS POINT I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THEIR ROLE KEY. PRIORITY ROLE IS- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY PART OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE CONVERSATION SO HARD TO ANSWER SPECIFICALLY BUT I AGREE WITH SENATOR UMBERG THAT. THE GOAL IS TO REALLY SIT DOWN WITH ALL THE PARTIES WHO ARE INVOLVED DETERMINED. NOT TO STOP WHAT IS NEEDED BUT REALLY HOW QUICKLY WE CAN PUT IT INTO PLACE SO THAT WE CAN START- YOU KNOW HAVING IT AVAILABLE AS A TOOL IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO WOULD YOU GUESS. ESTIMATE THAT IT WOULD BE A YEAR FROM NOW OR SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR AND A HALF I MEAN BEST GAS. WELL I A LAST DOCTOR GALLEY BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT WE LIKED THE FRAMEWORK IN PLACE BY JULY ONE RIGHT NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE. THANK DON'T HAVE A DATE YET YEAH OKAY BUT IN AND NO OKAY HARD TO GUESS I DON'T WANT TO ASK YOU TO GO GAS AND BRING THAT I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE CONTEMPLATED THAT. OKAY- WELL OUR YOU KNOW KUDOS TO YOU FOR TACKLING A VERY DIFFICULT- ISSUE THAT HAS PLAGUED CALIFORNIA FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND IT'S ONLY GOTTEN WORSE OVER THE YEARS- I WILL BE PERFECTLY CANDID WITH YOU AND TELL YOU THAT I HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF CONCERNS WITH THE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN WORKED OUT YET- I. EXPECT YOU WILL BE WORKING ON THOSE ALONG THE WAY AND PRIVATE MAIL PARTNERING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT AS OF TODAY THOUGH I AM NOT OPPOSED TO WHAT YOU ARE. PRESENTING I AM NOT COMFORTABLE. VOTING FOR WHAT'S IN PRINT RIGHT NOW BUT I WANT TO CONTINUE ON THE DISCUSSION BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH THANK YOU. OKAY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. OKAY SAYING ON HIS IT'S NOT A TURNOUT- SO AGAIN I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- THE QUICKLY THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS WE HEARD EXPRESSED BY THE OPPOSITION- ONE OF. I GUESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS OF THE HOUSING AND- I KNOW- BURCU AND I'D HAD A- CHANCE TO TALK AGENTS TOXIC RIGALI. SACRAMENTO COLLEGE I SAID NOT A CHANCE TO CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT IT. IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WITH YOU. SO WHAT THINGS WE HAVE NOT WE'RE NOT DOING TODAY IS THAT- ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW I'M BY MY STAFF HAVE. WORKED ON SOME IDEAS FOR AMENDMENTS WE'VE NOT ACTUALLY TAKING A MOMENT STATE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT- TRY TO FIGURE OUT LANGUAGE FOR SOME OF THOSE THINGS THE PRICE NEEDS MORE WORK SO- SO WHAT I'M GOING TO ASK OUR GUESTS IS BABYSIT MORE OF A SET OF COMMITMENTS TO WORK ON. ON THESE ISSUES. SINCE WHEN ASKING FOR SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS TODAY. SO WHAT ON THE HOUSING HOUSING AND- IS THAT- I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS WERE LOOKING AT- BUT- AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD THE TESTIMONY. ON BOTH ACTUALLY FROM. BOTH THE OPPOSITION BUT ALSO FROM THE PROPONENTS THOUSAND SEPARATE GOLLY THE PORTENTS OF HOUSING RIGHT IF SOMEONE'S GOING THROUGH THE CHEMICAL PROCESS AND THERE'S- NO HOUSING IS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO DELIVER TO VARIOUS SERVICES- AND THE PLANET. FOR THE ACTOR. FIREMEN'S AND BILL IN THE MAIL FOR THE CARE COURT ACTUALLY HAVE A HOUSING PLAN. RIGHT THERE'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO ORDER TO HOUSING BUT YOU HAVE TO HOUSING PLAN- SO. THE WAY THINGS- I WOULDLIKE TO SEE. PLAYER FUTURE AERATION THE BILL BEFORE IT HITS THE FLOOR- CONCEPTUALLY IS THAT THEN- THAT SOMEONE WHO'S IN CARE COURT WHICH WE SERVE THE FIND THIS YOU KNOW THAT THE PERSON LIKE RIGHT AT THE- PERFECTLY AT THE BREAK A GOOD SERVICE. RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT YOU HAVE TO BE. UP IN A- JOHN SITUATION THAT AT LEAST AT THAT HAVE- I WOULD SAY FIRST PRIORITY ON ANY HOUSING CONSISTENT WITH THE HOUSING PLAN RIGHT SO YOU KNOW FOURTH WE CAN'T PREDICT EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS- BUT- YOU KNOW IS IT WORKING OUT THE CARE COURT PLAN. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE OF. SOME SORT OF YEAH WELL I'LL SAY FIRST PRIORITY RIGHT- IF THEY'LL MAYBE AT THE VERY TIME THAT WORD THERE'S NO OF DEMAND BUT- MAY SHOW UP THE NEXT DAY. AND MAY BE THERE THAT DAY THAT CENTER- THAT WE TALK THAT IN FACT I THINK SECTOR GOLLY TALKED ABOUT. AND HE TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW. THEY'RE NOT IN THE LINE WELL LET'S PUT IT AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING PART BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PARTS ARE GONNA REALLY WORK THAT WELL. ABOUT IT. THEN I WOULD SAY IS THAT AT LEAST WHILE THEY'RE UNDER THE CARE COURT PLAN HOWEVER LONG IT ISN'T- AND ASSUME YOU KNOW THEIR COPIES OF THAT. THAT THEY ARE SURE CONTINUED HOUSING SO THAT DOESN'T S. IMMEDIATE SANDY SAXON PLACE THAT WERE INITIALLY SIGNED BUT- THEY CAN'T BE DESTRUCTION A PLACE WITH ANOTHER PLACE TO GO TO KNOWS YOU CAN'T JUST THIS CHARGE AND ON TO THE STREET. NOW OF COURSE THEY'LL COOPERATE AND OTHER THINGS THEY FALL OUT ALREADY IN THE CONSERVATORSHIP. ALL THE BUT AT LEAST WHILE THEY'RE- IN THE PLAN. SO I GUESS I'D- ASK IS THAT. SOMETHING ELSE AT THE LEASING CONCEPT IS THAT A COMMITMENT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE AND MAYBE AUTHORS IT. IN DIFFERENT DIRECTOR AND THE HEARING ALSO DISSECT OLLIE IS WELL THE. CEASES TO GET IT. WE MAKE OKAY EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT AS A- OLLIE. COMMENTS ON THE CON. SORRY FOR THE RECORD YOU HAVE TO BE AT THE OF. SUCH ARGUE FOR UP IN IN A CA WE MAKE TO KEEP WORKING THIS VERY ESSENTIAL ABOUT OKAY ALL RIGHT AND MAYBE IT'S JUST IF I DO HAVE YOU STILL SORRY IN THE IT'S NOT. CITY TOO MUCH IS A GOOD FOR ANYONE ANYWAY WILL BE THE CITY A LONG TIME- AND THEN THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE THAT- ALSO. ENGINE IS THAT HAVE A I THINK I'VE EXPRESSED ON SOME OCCASIONS THAT- YOU KNOW. THE COURT IS NOT DESTROY THE FRIENDLIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD. BUT INSPECTOR GUY USE ONLY MAKE THE CASE THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS THIS ON FROM THE IS IT MAY BE. AND OUR DESIRE THAT THAT'S NOT THE NECESSARILY THE INITIAL COUNTER YOU WANT IT CENTER OF THAT UNFORTUNATELY IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THAT IS. BUT THAT IT THE BILL SO IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE SWAPPING OUT LOWER GUIDANCE ON THE COURT. AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE TO COURT AND FORTY DELIVER. COURT BEFORE SHE MAY BE A CRIMINAL COURT THERE ARE SOME OTHER TYPE OF COURSE WHICH IS ACTUALLY AND PERHAPS EVEN LESS FRIENDLY THAN HOPEFULLY WE CAN. BEAT SO I GET THAT- I AT IT IN TERMS OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. VALERIE'S BECAUSE WHEN BEING THE WANT THEM I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A PLAN. EVEN IF THE FOR SHOW UP TO THE COURT. I WANT TO THINGS I THINK WE LOOKED AT WAS ABOUT. FINES AND I HAD A DISCUSSION BIGELOW TWELVE. I DO I READ. THAT. THANK WE DID CRAFT THIS IDEAS SOME THOUGHT CITY IN THE END THAT'S AND POLICY ABOUT THE TRY ONE PERHAPS LITTLE CLOSER TO SOME OF THE THINGS ARE T. WHERE HAVE A EVALUATE BEFORE I KNOW WE ALSO TALK ABOUT WELL COULD BE THAT YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S FAIRLY. YOU KNOW WHO WHO- THERE'S CONCERNS BUT IT- BUT BEFORE THEY EVEN GO THROUGH THE CARE COURT PROCESS THAT PERHAPS WE SAY WELL START THIS TREATMENT YOU'LL FOLLOW UP WITH ME IT'S ADDRESS AND WHAT TRIGGERS THE CARE COURT IS THAT THEY DON'T START TREATMENT ARE THEY DON'T DO THE FOLLOW UP TO SEE HOW TO DO IT AND THEN THE THIRTY CONVERSATION FURTHER. AND THE END SO- BUT- OF LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT THE- ADDING IT TO IT BUT ALSO IF YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING SO I GUESS I'M LOOKING ALSO FOR WORKING ON SOME LANGUAGE TO SHORTEN THAT TIMELINE RECOGNIZING THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT SO MUCH A STRICT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN SEEING AN EXCIMER MONTH BUT THAT SO THAT THAT YOU ARE IN. A ACTUATION WHERE YOU'RE AT LEAST UNDER SOME ON GOING DOWN THE WHAT'S CARE IS RIGHT WORK IS CLEARLY DROPPING OFF AT THE END BUT THAT THERE ARE BUT THAT THERE ARE SOME. I'M GOING FLAT OUT MONITORING- FOLLOW UP TO THAT THAT'S- BUT THIS IS MORE SEND ARE FILLED. ATTEMPT BY FACEBOOK BUT- THAT. THAT THAT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE CARE FOR TO CARRY COURT WHEN THE LAST TIME THEY ACTUALLY HAD. BOTH THREE AGO. YES- IS AS WE SPOKE BEFORE I THINK IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION YOU WANT EVALUATIONS THAT ARE ARMENIAN FULL YOU GUYS ARE UP TO DATE WE UNDERSTAND THE RELAPSING REMITTING NATURE ESPECIALLY WITH THE TREATMENT OF THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON FOR CARE COURTS SO I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS I SAID- WE- HAVE A NUMBER OF IN. WILL LIKELY COME BE REFERRED TO CARE COURT THROUGH SUN THESE YOU KNOW SEVENTY TWO FOURTEEN DAY HOLD PROCESS HE'S IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN JUST TO THE POINT TAT YOU MADE ON. THE INVOLVEMENT OF COURTS FIVE. WE LOOK- I KNOW THE FELONY I S. T. DATA BETTER BUT I USED TO KNOW THE MISDEMEANOR S. T. DATA WHILE I WAS IN. HOW BEFORE 47% OF THE WHO WORK. FOR A ADOPTED DOWN IS TO CALL AND CONFIRM AND BECOME FELONY ICE TEA HAD NO CLINICAL SERVICES NOT A SINGLE MEDICAL ENCOUNTER SIX MONTHS BEFORE FOR THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEIR ARREST SO THIS NOTION THAT. SO MANY INDIVIDUALS DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACCESS TO CARE ISRAEL AND SO THE HOPE IS THAT WE MAKE SURE INDIVIDUALS WHO BEFORE THEY GO INTO THE CRIMINAL COURT PROCESS HI THERE IS A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY WE HAVE A CHANCE TO CHANGE THE DATA POINTS AND ENSURE SOME OF THE MOST. VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS GET THE CARE THEY NEED EARLIER THANKS- ALL RIGHT AT A SEVE MICHELLE COMPARES FETCHES AND WAVING US THROUGH A LOT OF TIMES I'M HERE FOR IF YOU LIKE I'LL GIVE HER A CHANCE TO. GRAB STRATEGIST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP HERE AND THEN I MIGHT Q. DOCTORS ARE TECHNICALLY TO RESPOND THANK YOU DR PAN AM MICHELLE AND I WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOC GEN AND ON THAT POINT I THINK IT DOES SPEAK TO SOME OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS THAT I'VE BEEN ANXIOUS TO SERVE TIME IN ON- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO FLAG IS THAT. MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE DO AND TO BE HERE. NOT UNDER MEDIC UNDER PRIVATE AND- THERE WE NEED TO BE CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL INCLUDING AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ALLOW FOR US TO REIMBURSE FOR THESE SERVICES AND I THIN ONE OF THE BIG FAULT LINES HERE IS THAT WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHO MANAGES INSURANCE. MAY PULL INSURANCE CLAIMS NAY SAY AHA. COUNTIES HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT THEY'VE DONE NOTHING HERE. WHEN IN FACT WHAT HAPPENS UNDER CARE COURT S. IS WITH THE CASE TODAY IS THAT THE TIME THAT WE SPEND OUT IN THE FIELD WORKING TO ENGAGE SOMEBODY WILL NEVER BE SEEN AS A MEDICAL CLAIM. SO THERE WILL BE NO CHILL THERE WILL BE NO EVIDENCE OF THE WORK THAT HAPPENED THAT WE LARGELY FUND THROUGH AN HSA DOLLARS. THEY'RE ALSO HAS SENATOR EGGMAN KNOWS. NOT WELL ACCOUNTED FOR. AND SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEGREE OF THE OUTREACH SERVICES THEY WERE GONNA HAVE TO DO UNDER CARE COURT BECAUSE NONE OF IT IS COMPULSORY WE ARE LITERALLY GOING TO HAVE TO GO. SEARCHING FOR PEOPLE. AND THEN BEGGING FOR THEM TO COME AND WORK WITH US AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BEFORE A JUDGE. IS GOING TO HAVE QUESTIONS AND WON'T UNDERSTAND THE NUANCES OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS. COMMITTEE IS IT COULD BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND APPRECIATED HOW MUCH OF THIS WORK IS ACTUALLY US HAVING TO TRACK PEOPLE DOWN DRIVE THEM TO COURT. AND ALL OF THAT STUFF TIME WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED UNDER MEDICARE. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WITH THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE TODAY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE AND MORE MONEY WITHIN MEDIC HOW TO BRING IN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION AND THAT IS OUR LARGEST COST CENTER RIGHT NOW. WE GET THE MOST MONEY FROM OUR HELP REIMBURSEMENT SO- JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ELEMENTS ABOUT STAFFING AND REIMBURSEMENT AND THERE'S NO NEW MONEY BEING PUT ON THE TAPE BURKE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNDER THIS PROPOSAL ZERO DOLLARS. SO THAT IS IMPORTANT WE THINK CAN AND HAVE NOTS AGAINST TOO MUCH DETAIL BUT JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE UNDER MEDICARE HOW DID BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACTUALLY RUNS A- CENTURY OF BIAFRA HEALTH MANAGED. IN THE ZONE TERMS OF SO IT'S NOT. I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE DOING RISK BASED RIGHT NOW THEY'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CAPITATED A RISK BASED AT ALL WE'RE FEE FOR SERVICE AND COST BASED WHICH MEANS EVERY MINUTE OF OUR TIME HAS TO BE DOCUMENTED. IN ORDER TO GET REIMBURSED ON A FEE FOR SERVICE RATES. SO NO THAT'S THE THING I MEAN OBVIOUSLY REPURPOSE GRAYSON CAPITATED MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT STORY BUT IT'S NOT OKAY SO I GUESS THE OTHER ISSUES THEN IS THAT- I GUESS IS. STE SO HOW DO YOU TRY TO CAPTURE SOME OF THOSE CURRENT EXPENSES DETERMINED OBVIOUSLY YOU SAY ME AND I GET REIMBURSED FOR THE CLAIM DEALS FASTEST INVISIBLE IT'S OFF BOOK TO MEDICARE. WELL WHICH IS PART OF THE PACKAGE. OKAY AND I GETS OFF BOOK THE MEDIC COW BUT IT BUT YOU'RE TRACKING THAT RIGHT. WELL I MEAN WE HAVING WE HAVE. CONTRACTS AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW AT TIMES- SYSTEMS TO DOCUMENTED BUT IF IT'S NOT IN INSURANCE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY GET AN OPTION OF THE CLAIM AT THE CONTRACT AND SO. I THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH IN THE MECHANICAL WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE. YEAH A LOT OF THIS STUFF IT'S NOT GONNA BE PAID FOR AND THERE WILL BE NO ABILITY TO. ACTUALLY ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS WE WERE PROPOSED. ACTUALLY TO. PRIVATE INSURANCE SIDE OF THE- NOTHING'S GONNA COVER ANYTHING SIXTY GOLLY DID YOU WANT TO PERHAPS RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE BEING RAISED BY THE WORLD IN TERMS OF THEIR SAYING LIKE OKAY THIS IS A NEW BURDEN ON US IT'S NOT GONNA BE REIMBURSABLE UNDER MEDICARE WELL YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WORKING WITH YOUNG STATE BUDGETS AND SO FORTH- WHAT. WILL YEAH THAT WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD SO TO COMMENTS ONE ON THE- COMMERCIAL OR THE PRIVATE YEAH I'D AGREE- HAVE SHARED WITH- MICHELLE THE- WILLINGNESS CERTAINLY TO LOOK AT WHERE. THINGS NEED TO BE TIGHTER IN LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ON DO RESPONSIBILITY- IS ON THE COUNTY IN THAT WAY THAT IS- REIMBURSED IN TERMS OF. THE TIME IT'S RIGHT I MEAN. YOU KNOW AS A CLINICIAN I KNOW AS A CLINICIAN THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE END UP DOING THAT DON'T FALL INTO A CLAIM BRONZE ON THE MEDICAL RECORD THAT WE TRIED DO- TO HELP FACILITATE THINGS FOR PATIENTS I DON'T WANT TO DISAGREE IN ANY WAY. I'VE LIVED IT MYSELF DOING THAT ENGAGEMENT GOING DOWN- THROUGHOUT. DIFFERENT PARTS FOR STATE TO ALSO MEET INDIVIDUALS AND ON THE ENGAGE IN PEACE THE- ATIONS. TO A- CAN LOOK UP. WHAT SOME OF THOSE OUTSIDE OF MEDICO- IT MINISTRY TO FALL OR NON ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS LOOK LIKE AND UNDERSTANDING WHERE- WE TAKE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE SUPPORT IS THERE THAT DOES NOT THOUGH- IGNORE. THE RESPONSIBILITY UNDER SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CORE SERVICES THAT INCLUDE SOME OF THAT ENGAGEMENT WORK SOME OF THAT OUTREACH WORK- ECCENTRICITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACCOUNT FOR BOTH PIECES. AFFECTED AND SUPPORTED- IN THE APPROPRIATE MANNER AS WE LOOK AT THIS OVER THE WEEKS TO COME OKAY SO SUCCESS I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WOULD BE IN. SEE WHAT. IT'S GOING TO BE REIMBURSABLE UNDER MEDICARE I'LL WHAT'S NOT OR WHAT'S GONNA BE REIMBURSABLE WHAT'S NOT AND HOW WE ADDRESS THE UNREIMBURSED PART THAT WE MAY NOT BILL DROP DOWN HEALTHCARE DOLLARS FOR RIGHT SO WHETHER DEPRIVE INSURANCE MEDICARE ALL OR WHATEVER OTHER SOURCES. UNDER IT'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT UNDER YOU KNOW DIRECTORS MEDIKAL THURSDAY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE RIGHT AND UNDER THE HSR VARIOUS AND WITHOUT GETTING TO ALL OF THE COMPLEXITY IS WHICH I THINK MANY OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS IN COLLEAGUES UNDERSTAND BOTH WITHIN GOVERNMENT AND OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT BUT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO LOOK AT THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE SUPPORTING THE PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AFFECTED. OKAY ALL RIGHT SO CERTAINLY OF INTEREST IN SAYING THAT OF ALL- AND AGAIN I THINK- AND I NOTICED- CENTER LEYVA MENTIONED DEALS WE HAD IN OUR POLICY COMMENTS THE AMENDMENTS SOME HOPING THAT THOSE CAN- THOSE WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE- AS. WELL AND THE SYSTEM. AND THEN. SO WE'VE HAD- WE TALKED ABOUT- WILL BE ON THE- FINANCING END OF THINGS- AND THEN- AND THEN SERVE TIME LINES AS WELL AS WELL AND I KNOW YOU YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO CONVERSATION WORKING ON THE ONE. LANGUAGE THE LANGUAGE THERE AND THEN I GUESS FINALLY. AND I DO APPRECIATE THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT. THE VOLUNTARINESS ARE LACK OF VOLUNTARINESS AND I KNOW SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED AND I THINK SOME CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY SOME OF THE ADVOCATES ABOUT- NOW I THINK THERE. ARE TIMES WHERE AND JOBS I SUPPORT LAURA'S LAW AND STUFF- SO I KNOW MAKES SOME PEOPLE DISAGREE WITH THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME CIRCUMSTANCES- BUT ESPECIALLY. BUT IT'S ALSO A LAST RESORT AND I THINK IT I THINK EVERYONE AGREES EVEN OF US ARE STILL- JUST WANNA BE SURE WE HAVE CLARITY IN THE LANGUAGE ABOUT. WHATEVER WOULD TRIGGER ARE MAYBE NOT IN THE CARE COURT GREAT LIFT THE SITUATION BUT- AGAIN TO BE SURE WE RESPECT THE AUTONOMY OF PATIENTS AND ADULTS ONLY TRULY A- LAST RESORT. WHERE THERE'D BE CIRCUMSTANCE WHAT THEIR DAD LOOK ACTUALLY. RECORDER. FIVE MAKE DECISIONS WE JUST DON'T AGREE WITH AND- YOU KNOW AND SO FORTH AND WE HAVE TO RESPECT THAT RIGHT. SO OKAY SO I SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE IS THAT WITHIN MY PROPOSED FORMAL AMENDMENTS- THE SITE AFTER A CONVERSATION WE HAD DRAFTED SUM UP BUT- OKAY GIVE YOU SOMETIME TO WORK ON IT SOME THE LANGUAGE ANYWAY BEEN REALLY HARD TO WORK OUT. SO BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE MOVING FORWARD. AND I'M HOPING THAT- YOU CAN COMMITTED TO DOING THAT- THIS IS. A SPORT. YES AT THE START. RIGHT YEAH I FOLLOW UP WITH DOCTOR GALLAGHER. DR AS WE HAVE JUST IN THE PAST AND I KNOW YOU KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I. THE- I MET BACK IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES RESULTED IN FUNDING INEQUITY IN OUR COUNTIES NORTH OF SELF SERVING COASTAL TO INLAND. AND I'M CONCERNED A LITTLE BIT I'M STILL SUPPORTING THIS. BOTH FEET IN BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE IT SOUNDS LIKE THE COUNTY'S EFFORTS IN THE OBLIGATIONS OF COUNTIES. WILL NOT LIKELY BE REIMBURSED AT LEAST UNDER THE CURRENT RULES. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE THE COUNTIES GET THE FUNDING. TO DO THE KIND OF THINGS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED BY THE CARE ACT OBVIOUSLY VALUABLE AND ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS THAT NEED IT PERFORMED BUT OF COURSE. SOMEBODY HAS TO FIND THE MONEY TO COVER THE COSTS. IT IS AND I KNOW WE'RE IN THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE'LL HAVE THIS CONVERSATION IN A DIFFERENT FORM. BLOOD IT WILL THE LIGHTS WHICH BRIEFLY DONE ON THE CARE ACT. BEFORE WE DETERMINE WHAT THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING WILL BE FOR COUNTIES PARTICULARLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE UNDER RESOURCE NOW SOME OF THEM MAY BE EXPERIENCING A SURPLUS OF SOME SORT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS BUT I'M SURE THAT SURPLUS WON'T GO VERY FAR- IF THERE'S NOT ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY FLOWING. TO THEM. CAN YOU THAT SUBJECT I WILL TO DO MY BEST TO ASSIST YOU AND I HAVE ENGAGED ON THE SAME CONVERSATION IN THE PAST THE FIRST THING TO SAY IS THE COMMITMENT WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER ABOUT WHAT'S BEING WORKED OUT IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS GO INTO SOME OF THE NEW COMPONENTS OF THE CARE COURT PLAN THE SUPPORTER ROLE AS AN EXAMPLE IS SOMETHING THAT. WE'RE WORKING ON EXACTLY WHAT THE FUNDING THE MATTER THE MECHANISM AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK BUT THAT WILL BE AUGMENTED FATHER AUGMENTATIONS ARE ALSO EXPECTED WORKING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE ARE COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS MIGHT BE ON SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED HERE BUT I WILL UNDERSCORE I THINK THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN SENATOR ADMINS COMMENTS THIS DOES NOT ADDRESS THE REALIGNMENT IN EQUITY THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING HISTORIC OVERTIME I DON'T THINK THAT I HAVE THE TOOLS TODAY TO ADDRESS THAT FULLY FOR YOU BUT THE IDEA THAT. THE RESOURCES IN COUNTIES COULD BE AND MAYBE SOME OF US BELIEVE SHOULD BE DEPLOYED TO. WE ARE. EVEN FIRST A PRIORITY I THINK IS PART OF WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON AND SO- MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING COUNTIES BEING CLEAR. SAID THIS IS A POPULATION OF PRIORITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND ENSURING THAT THOSE DOLLARS- EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DO EVERYTHING- THE HEAD THAT ARE. BILL THAT COUNTY MADE. TO DO FOUR FIVE EXPECT THEMSELVES TO DO THIS IS A PRIORITY POPULATION THAT THOSE DOLLARS SHOULD BE. SUPPORTING AND THEN SIMILARLY THE CONCEPT AROUND HOUSING TO MAKE SURE THOSE INVEST SO WE TALKED ABOUT THAT HAVE GONE INTO THE STATE BUDGETS OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO AUGMENT. THIS YEAR ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN BEHAVIOR HOPE BRIDGE HOUSING AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET REALLY TARGETING HOUSING SOLUTIONS FOR EXACTLY BUT NOT. ONLY FOR BUT INCLUDING THE CARE COURT POPULATION THAT WE ANTICIPATE BEING REFERRED WELL I DIDN'T INTEND TO BEAT YOU UP ON MENTAL HEALTH REALIGNMENT THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT MAY EVEN BE. AT LEAST. MODERN TIME BUT BUT IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT IN SOME COUNTIES IN SOME REGIONS THE- THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AVAILABLE IS- REMAINS WILL FEEL WOEFULLY INADEQUATE TO SERVICE THE POPULATION GROWS SINCE WE WERE DEALING WITH. MENTAL HEALTH REALIGNMENT AND IT IT IT HIGHLIGHTS THE SITUATION WHERE SOME COUNTIES MAY NEED A LITTLE HELP- TO DO THESE THINGS ASSOCIATED WITH CARE COURT BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY BETWEEN PROP SIXTY THREE AND- MENTAL HEALTH REALIGNMENT OF TO FUND WHAT. THE CORE FUNCTION. NOW INCLUDING CARE COURT AND I ASSUME WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IS THE BUDGET MOVES FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK. TO MAKE TO GO TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE THIS THING WORK THAT'S THAT'S MY ONLY COMMENT PRESHEAF CHU TOLERATING ME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR PATIENCE. OKAY ANY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SAYING NONE- JENS. THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION- HOPING YOU CAN COMMENT ON THE COMMITMENTS- AND YOUR CLOTHES- CENTER- BERGEN EGGMAN WHICH I LIKE TO CLOSE. I'M SURE. OF THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. A COUPLE POINTS NUMBER ONE TODAY IS DAY TWO OF LEGISLATIVE JOURNEY AND THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS- WE WILL COMMIT TO THE CONCERNS OF THE CHAIR AND THE CONCERNS OF OTHERS. THE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THE FOLKS WHO HAVE LIVED EXPERIENCE HAVE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY AND LET ME JUST. ADDRESS ONE ASPECT IN ONE CONCERN AND THAT'S THE CONCERN THAT THAT SOME MAY HAVE. HAVING HAD. BAD EXPERIENCES OR SCARY EXPERIENCES IN THE COURTS I'VE BEEN IN COURT MANY TIMES I'M STILL STILL SCARED WHEN I COME TO COURT I. OFTENTIMES SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO BE THAT WAY THERE ARE COURTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE OPERATING TODAY WHERE THERE ARE JUDGES WHO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT A VERY SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT'S THE VISION THAT'S PART OF THE VISION OF THE CARE COURTS IS THAT WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF APART BUT WE- ALSO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE. UNDER THE- HM IS ACCOUNT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GETTING THE SUPPORT THAT THEY REQUIRE TO BE SUCCESSFUL ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE HAD THROUGHOUT GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY IN IT IS MY HOPE AND DESIRE THAT WE BUILD THAT INTO THE SYSTEM SO THAT WE THE BEST WE CAN POSSIBLY DO TO REACH THE GOAL THAT YOU WANT IN THAT WE WANT AND THAT ALL OF US WANT IN TERMS OF STABILITY AND- A RETURN TO- A SITUATION THAT IS LIVABLE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE. ILLNESS AND SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY JOINT AUTHORS CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU AND I THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR THE CONVERSATION TO THE OPPOSITION TO THE SUPPORTERS. INTEND TO THE ENGAGEMENT- WE DO COMMIT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS IS IN OUR WORKS IT IS OUR SECOND DAY IN IN THE- IN COMMITTEES- AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS THAT THE GOAL IS A COMPASSIONATE PLACE WE PROVIDE CARE FOR THOSE MOST IN NEED. THEY GIVE ALL SAID THE STATUS. QUO IS NOT OKAY BUT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS NOT BEEN WORKING WE TO TRY DIFFERENT- WE ARE WE ARE FULL IN IN AND MAKING WORKING RISK ASK FOR I. PHONE. THANK THANK YOU I DON'T I'VE HAD SECOND. ALL RIGHT SAID I THINK CENTER GOT THERE FOR. SO SECOND CENTER ROCK THAT. WE THAT FOR. AGAIN I WANT THANKS A THREE DOLLAR FOR BEING. AND TAKING TIME AND QUESTIONS WELL. I CAN. TO SO THE- IS PASS REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON PROP. AND IT'S BEEN SECOND SET. TO ROTH. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL EGGMANAYE CAN SALAS. GROVE FURTADO LEYVA LEYVA I LIMON LIMON I ROTH ALL RIGHT ROTH FIVE RUBIO. RUBIO AYE WIENER WIENER BY GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I. OKAY THE BILL'S CURLY EIGHT ZERO HOLD THE BILL- YOU REFER- ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY- NEXT ITEM IS ACTUALLY ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN SB FOURTEEN FORTY SIX BY CENTER STERN WELCOME AND BASS FISHING YOUR PATIENTS. THAT OF ALTHOUGH I THINK OUR DISCUSSION ON YOUR BILL THAT WAS INPUT HOPEFULLY BE INFORMED BY DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD. AS WELL. I WAS GOING SAY I MIGHT HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THE COMMITTEE- BUT I DON'T MEAN TO BE TOO PRESUMPTUOUS SO DOCTOR PAN. CAN I PROCEED IS ENTERING THIS QUICKLY YES THANK YOU. SOME I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL FOURTEEN FORTY SIX AND I APPRECIATE THE- LISTENING TO THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION THAT THE COMMITTEE JUST ENGAGED IN. AND I SHARE. NUMBER THE CONCERNS FROM FROM THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS FROM THE MEMBERS- WHEN YOU GET INTO THE ISSUES THAT. SURROUND SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS FOR SO MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL LEFT BEHIND. EVERY TIME THEY ENTER THE SYSTEM. THEY'RE EITHER TRAUMATIZING FORCED HOSPITALIZATION OR THEY SPEND SOME TIME IN THE CENTRAL JAIL OR MAYBE GET SOME KIND OF TEMPORARY HOUSING ARRANGEMENT BUT- THE SOLUTIONS AT THIS POINT ARE NOT PERMANENT. WHAT'S MISSING RIGHT NOW IS AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS BILL IS CONCEDED LEE ASPIRATIONAL AND- HIGH LEVEL AND SCOPE. WE WOULD ACTUALLY PUT FORWARD A RIGHT I% GUARANTEE IN LAW TO THE PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. TO ANYBODY WHO'S NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY THE RESULT OF EITHER THEIR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS OR OTHER ISSUES THEY'RE FACING. THEY WOULD BE GUARANTEED TREATMENT HOUSING. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER. A LOT OF LONG LIST OF ISSUES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE RESOLVED IN TERMS OF HOW THAT RIGHT WOULD ACTUALLY BE FULFILLED- HOW WOULD BE PAID FOR ON THE BOOKS WHEN IT COMES TO MEDICARE NOW. WE TALKED ABOUT THE SPORADIC NATURE OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- AND THE LACK OF ONGOING FUNDING AT THE STATE LEVEL. BUT THIS BILL WOULD SEEK TO REMEDY. AT LEAST THE INTENT- CAN I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS ENGAGEMENT ON THIS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT. DO YOU REQUIRE FOR BILLS THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE I MEAN. YOU ALL THE HIGH STANDARD AND- AND THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN PROGRESS OUT THERE. I WOULD SUBMIT TO THE TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THOUGH THAT. THAT THIS WORK IN PROGRESS. IS NECESSARY TO MOVE AS WERE HAVING THESE OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CARE COURTS. OR THIS OTHER KIND OF TREATMENT THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. HI MY MINOR TO HAVE. CENTER EGGMAN HAS BEEN FRANKLY LEADING. THIS CONVERSATION AS AS OUR PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR HERE AND IS THAT ONE TIMES NOT GOING TO DO IT WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF SOMEBODY. FINANCIALLY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE. AND PEOPLE WHO ARE. DISABLED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DUE TO A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY HAVE THAT GUARANTEED RIGHT. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT. SOMEONE RECEIVED FOR THEIR INTELLECTUAL OR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY PER BED YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THE CURRENT BOARDING CARE LEVELS- A SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN THAT AND WE'RE THOUSANDS THE BED SHORT. AND I THINK THIS GOVERNOR'S BEEN BOLD IN THIS WITH THIS ONE TIME FUNDING PROPOSAL TO LOOK AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND TO LOOK AT INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS LEGISLATION. IS OFFER A DIFFERENT WAY IN- NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE TOOLS OF WHAT CARE. WOULD DO- BUT IN CHANGING THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE AROUND THE PROGRAM. NO I HAVE. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW I OFFERED SOME SOME IDEAS THAT SOUNDED LIKE MIGHT ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS MAYBE THE COMMITTEE OR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT. LITIGATION RISK AROUND THIS LEGISLATION IF YOU CAUGHT A FIRE RIGHT IN LAW TO GUARANTEE TREATMENT HOUSING. WITH EVERYONE JUST START SUING EACH OTHER TO LOCK IN THAT RIGHT. COULD THE COUNTIES TO THE STATE. COULD PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO COUNTIES- YOU KNOW COULD INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES SEEK RECOURSE. I DON'T WANT TO GO THERE YET WITH THIS LEGISLATION SO YOU KNOW WHAT IF THE BILL DOES MOVE FOR TODAY I JUST WANT TO ASSURE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR. THAT WE WANT TO PRESCRIBE THIS LEGISLATION WE WANT TO COORDINATE OFTEN CONSTRAIN IT- IN A WAY THAT. WOULD NOT GIVE ANYONE A PUBLIC OR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- WOULD NOT OFFER THAT THAT ABILITY TO. TO SAY STALL OUT OR DECIDE THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM AS OPPOSED TO THE BUDGET PROCESS EXACTLY HOW- WE GET TREATMENT AND HOUSING TO EVERYBODY WHO NEEDS IT. BUT I DO THINK THERE'S POWER IN CODIFYING IN CALIFORNIA LAW THAT THIS OUGHT TO BE A RIGHT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING OR HAVE. THE GUARANTEE THAT GOES BEYOND A TWO YEAR CYCLE. ENDS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THE BILL FOLLOWING ON AFTER THAT LAST LEGISLATION AS- I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS THE SOLUTION- I THINK THERE COULD BE A MORE TAILORED APPROACH WE COULD PROBABLY SOLVE SOME OF THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT WHEN WE WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT WHAT WE'RE EXPIRING TOWARDS. SOME ASSURANCE THAT HEARD THE WORD ASSURANCE. LET'S PUT THAT INSURANCE. LET'S PUT LET'S PUT OUR- OUR MOUTHS WERE MONIES. RIGHT LET'S ACTUALLY LOCK THAT INTO LAW SOMEHOW THE SAME WAY WE DO WITH THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. WHERE WE SET IN STATE LAW EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO SAFE DRINKING WATER IN CALIFORNIA. WE DIDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE TO GO TO EVERYBODY AND LOCK THAT IN WE NEGOTIATED SOLUTION OVER COMING YEARS. BUT WE PUT OUR INTENT. INTO THE CALIFORNIA CODE AND THAT HAS POWER AND I HOPE THAT YOU KNOW IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH ACLU DISABILITY RIGHTS CALVO ACES WESTERN CENTER BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ALL THE FOLKS HERE THE COUNTY CITY STATE LEVEL DH CS EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU KNOW. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO COME THE TABLE AND TRY TO FIND SOME SOLUTIONS I WAS VERY ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THE SECRETARY- OFFER THAT WILLINGNESS IN THE PAST AUTHORS- THIS BILL IS NOT JUST LIMITED TO THE CARE COURTS I DIDN'T DESIGN IT THAT WAY THIS OTHER ISSUE. YOU KNOW THIS PROPOSAL IN MARCH LONG BEFORE THAT BUT- HOPE YOU CAN APPRECIATE THAT. IF WE'RE GOING TO ASPIRE WE GOT TO DO THAT IN LAW SOMEHOW. AND THAT PEOPLE DO NEED THESE ASSURANCE IF THEY'RE GONNA ENTER. THE KIND OF SYSTEM THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO I'M HONORED TO HAVE. A DIRECT PRACTITIONER ON THE STREET. WHO HAS TO FIND SOME WAY MEDI CAL DOLLARS ARE NOT. BEING OR NOT STATE FARM THEY'RE NOT WHO ACTUALLY JUST HAS TO WORK ON SKID ROW AND TREAT. THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE OUT THERE DR SUSAN PART TOBY'S WHITNEY FROM. HOMELESS HEALTH CARE LOS ANGELES TO DELIVER. AT INITIAL TESTIMONY ON IT. AND THEN TERESA PASQUINI WHO. REALLY TURNED ME ON TO THE AYE IDEA OF HOUSING THAT HEALS. AND HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES CAN BE ON THE LINE SO. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE. AND YES BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING THE RIGHT THING THANK YOU CENTER STARTED SO LET'S- BURKE I THINK SUSAN- PART OBVIOUS HERE YES OKAY WELCOME- SO. WE GOT TO WITNESSES SO IT'S TWO MINUTES APIECE TOTAL FOUR MINUTES TOGETHER TO RUN OVER IT TAKES TIME AWAY FROM THE OTHER PERSON TO FOLLOW SO I'LL GIVE YOU A POINTS TWO MINUTES I'LL SAY TWO MINUTES.

AND STARTED THE FIRST STREET MEDICINE TEAM THERE IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN UNDER HOUSING FOR HELP UNDER DR MARK GALLI. WHAT KEEPS ME AWAKE AT NIGHT HOWEVER ARE MY SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL PATIENTS. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL COULD BE POLITICAL BUT I'M A DOCTOR. MY DUTIES TO SAVE LIVES BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU. KNOW WHO'S GOING TO DIE. IN MONTHS AND THERE IS VERY LITTLE I CAN DO BECAUSE THERE'S NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO VERY FEW BOARDING CARES THAT TAKE CARE OF THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO ADEQUATE FUNDING STREAM AVAILABLE AS SOCIETY PAYS THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS A DAY WHICH IS IN ADEQUATE WHERE IS BECAUSE THE WINTER MINUTE ACT PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL- OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. CAN LIVE IN A GROUP HOME WITH TWENTY FOUR SEVEN STAFF WHERE THE OWNER THAT. RECEIVES UP TO NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. FROM THE STATE TO CARE FOR THEM WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN ADULT WITH DEVELOPMENTAL OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND ADULTS WITH UNTREATED SCHIZOPHRENIA. I A PHYSICIAN AND A PSYCHO BIOLOGIST I KNOW THAT BOTH HAVE A BRAIN DISEASE OFTEN REQUIRING TREATMENT. OFTEN NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES NEEDING VARYING DEGREES OF SUPPORT HOW DID WE DECIDE. WHICH BRAIN DISORDER GETS TREATMENT AND WHICH DOESN'T- THE SEVERELY MENTALLY LITTLE. ILL END UP LIVING ON THE STREETS IN AND OUT OF JAILS IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE. ONE MAY ASK WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING TO COME FROM BUT DO WE ASK WHERE THE FUNDS FOR VACCINATIONS. NO BECAUSE WE KNOW VACCINATIONS ARE LIFESAVERS WOULD WE SAY KIDS WILL GET.

FIFTY OPPOSITION FIELD PRESS ONE AND THEN THOROUGH. THIS IS. NO I THINK YOU ALL RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER JUST THE REALLY A STATEMENT I SUSPECT WE ALL AGREE THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT. SHOULD HAVE AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND HOUSING. THE PROBLEM TODAY AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR RECOGNIZES THIS IS WE CAN'T MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE IMPACTED OR MEET THE MOMENT IS THE GOVERNOR WOULD SAY. WE CAN'T MEET THE GUARANTEE. I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR CLARIFYING THAT THE BILL IS ASPIRATIONAL IT'S AN ASPIRATION I SHARE I SUSPECT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DIETS TO WAS WELL. BUT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT CREATE A RITE OF ACTION RIGHT TO SUE- AT LEAST AT THIS POINT IN TIME. SO BASED ON THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY AND I THINK THEY OUGHT TO BRING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I RECOMMEND I WOULD ALSO SAY. I WOULD CONCUR WITH MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES- BUT I'M A CO AUTHOR ON THIS IS A AS WELL I FULLY BELIEVE IN A MUCH YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO- BUT HASN'T BEEN SECONDED YET I WILL DO THAT AM. I REMOVED SOME OF OUR SO OKAY- AND- THANK YOU. OKAY YES SIR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- SENATORS STERN I. I'M NOT AN UNDERSTANDING- SENATOR RIGHTS COMMENT THAT IT DOESN'T CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OR THAT IT WOULDN'T ALLOW SOMEONE TO SEE YOU- BECAUSE IT SAYS RIGHT HERE IN THE BILL THAT- IT WOULD TAKE STROLLER RIGHT ON PEOPLE FOR HOUSING IN THE SERVICES SO. IS A COMMITMENT TO MAKING IN I'M IN AMENDMENTS THAT I WOULD PROMISE TO THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T WANT TO SUGGEST ANY AMENDMENTS AT THIS POINT SO THEY'RE NOT OFFICIAL COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO. BE TAKING THAT SPECIFIC AMENDMENT TODAY BUT WE'VE- WE'VE DRAFTED THAT LANGUAGE JOB AND I'M I WON'T BE BRINGING THIS BILL UP SHOULD IT LEAVE THE COMMUNITY I WON'T BE BRINGING UP ON THE FLOOR. OUR TRYING TO MOVE IT OUT OF OUR HOUSE WITHOUT THAT KIND OF- GUARDRAIL IN THERE TO REALLY CLARIFY THAT. DESPERATION HERE. AND NOT LITIGATION- OKAY SO YOU WERE GOING TO AMEND THE BILL. TO NOT MAKE IT A GUARANTEED RATE IS TO AM I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY I WOULD AMEND THE BILL TO NOT AUTHORIZE A PRIVATE OR PUBLIC RIGHT OF ACTION OKAY- I GET THAT THERE'S A- OKAY THAT'S IT I JUST WANT ENGINE SURE OKAY. AND SO- WE HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT- HEARING THE PREVIOUS BILL OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE HERE FOR A LARGE AREA MOST OF THE TESTIMONY IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF- PROVIDERS AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING OPTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR AND COMMUNITY SO. I GUESS I'M WONDERING HOW. YOU PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT I MEAN BECAUSE MAKING A STATEMENT DO YOU THINK IT'S A RIGHT FOR HOUSING IN A RIGHT FOR SERVICES IS ONE THING THE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SO WHAT IS WHAT IS THE PLAN TO BRING THAT TO FRUITION. IN YOUR BILL. I MEAN I BASE THE LAST DEBATE- I YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOT A SEE THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS TO RECTIFY THAT NOW THAT WOULD BE MY HOPE I MEAN. THE ANALOG BEING ON THE- CLEAN WATER- ISSUE. CODIFIED IN TWENTY TWELVE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN CALIFORNIA. TOOK FOR FIVE YEARS OF ADVOCACY NOW THERE'S ONGOING FUNDING TO DEAL WITH SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER ON AN ONGOING BASIS. SO IT WOULD TAKE A SEPARATE ACT BEYOND THIS LEGISLATION AYE AYE I WILL CONCEDE THAT THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE. BILL BUT- I THINK. THE PERSON I THINK IS IT FROM A VALUES PERSPECTIVE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL STATE THAT. IT'S INSUFFICIENT TO LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND AND THAT. THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON SUSTAINED ON GOING FUNDING IN THAT REGARD SO- IT THE DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS SPELLING YOUR BILL IS THAT THE PREVIOUS BILL- ADDRESSED A VERY SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE GAYS WHO WERE EITHER HAD VERY SEVERE. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WHERE YOUR BILL- DOESN'T IDENTIFY THAT THIS IS JUST ANYBODY WHO IS- YOU KNOW DOESN'T HAVE HOUSING FOR- BECAUSE I DON'T SEE I MEAN YOU TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN HERE BUT THE OLD JUST SAYS THAT- LET'S SEE HERE. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO LACKS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IS OTHERWISE NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT IPS IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO SAY SOMEONE WHO HAS SCHIZOPHRENIA OR SOMETHING THIS IS JUST ANYBODY WHO'S WHO'S ON HOUSE. WELL NO NOT NECESSARILY IT HAS TO BE AND IT ENDED AT DANGER TO THEMSELVES OKAY SO THAT DOESN'T SAY THAT IT WAS NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY SO THAT PRECONDITION. AND I WOULD I WAS NOT OKAY BUT HOLD ON I MEAN YOU KNOW WORK. IT'S THE WORDS ARE DEFINITELY IMPORTANT AND SO NOT LIVING SAFELY. IS A SUBJECTIVE PHRASE RATE IT IS I MEAN FRANKLY IT'S NOT SAFE. IT REALLY IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT YOU CAN. BE A FACTOR IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND SAY NO ONE LIVING ON THE STREETS EVEN IF THEY'RE IN. SOME SECLUDED DO EVERYWHERE THEY'RE PROTECTED LET'S SAY IT'S STILL NOT SAFE RATE. SO YOU'RE RIGHT YOU'RE RIGHT TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON THAT ISSUE AND EVEN OUR ADVOCATES IN THE- YOU KNOW. IT'S PAST QUEENIE ON THE LINE IS BROUGHT THE SAME THING UP I I'D BE WILLING. TO AMEND THE BILL- OR AT LEAST COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT AMENDMENT AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME- TO CONSTRAIN IT. STRICTLY TO. TO THOSE WHO ARE SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL- AND HAVE NO OTHER RESOURCES AT THEIR DISPOSAL. BUT WE WANTED TO LEAVE SOME DISCRETION IN DEFERENCE FOR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS TO MAKE THOSE KIND OF DETERMINATIONS ON THE STREETS. THAT THAT WAS THE HARD PART IS WE DIDN'T. WE DIDN'T WANT TO DEFINE IT JUST BASED ON IF SOMEONE SAY IS GRAVELY DISABLED BECAUSE YOU TRIGGER THAT A WHOLE OTHER RANGE OF QUESTIONS THAT IT WOULD ONLY BE ELIGIBLE FOR PEOPLE UP UNDER CONSERVATORSHIP STORE ELIGIBLE FOR CONSERVATIVES. WE DON'T WANT TO JUST STAY IN THAT SPACE BECAUSE THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THEM. SO- YOU'RE RIGHT TO POINT OUT THE ISSUE AND I AM. VERY WILLING TO MAKE- TO PUT THAT GRANULARITY THERE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY FOR ALL THESE COMMITMENTS. I WILL NOT DO THAT WITHOUT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE SO I DON'T GIVE YOU A CHOICE. I KNOW. I KNOW IT ALL TOO WELL NOW AND I JUST EVEN APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO HAVE ROOM TO WORK WITH. YOU ALL ON THAT SO. WELL I- I APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS AND YOUR RECOGNITION AND SOME OF THE YOU KNOW ISSUES WITH THE BILL- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT IT SEEMS VERY UNWORKABLE TO ME I'M TO SUGGEST THAT ANYBODY. WHO DOESN'T HAVE HOUSING WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO IT IS YOU KNOW OPERATE MEAN JUST THE FINANCIAL. COST COMES ALONG WITH THAT IS MONUMENTAL AS YOU KNOW- IS THIS SOMETHING I JUST IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS IT SINCE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S LARGELY A STATEMENT OF OUR VALUES I WONDER IF YOU'VE- EVEN CONSIDERED. PERHAPS BE A TURNING THIS INTO A RESOLUTION PERHAPS INSTEAD OF A BILL THAT WOULD. CONVERT THESE RATES ON PEOPLE. I WOULD CONSIDER IT- JUST THE I MEAN I WOULD JUST SAY THOUGH THAT. ANYBODY WHO'S STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE GUARANTEED RIGHT TO THAT TREATMENT WE TOOK UP WAS A BILL FROM SENATOR WIENER LAST YEAR TO PUSH THE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS TO FINALLY COVER. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THEY'VE BEEN DRAGGING THEIR HEELS ON SO. I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S OVERLY BROAD AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS IS JUST FOR PEOPLE AROUND HOUSE NO THAT THAT THAT REALLY THAT WAS INTENTIONAL- I RECOGNIZE THAT. OVER YOU COULD READ THAT BILL THE SAY EVERYONE THEN WHATEVER RIGHT TO HOUSING- BUT THIS IS REALLY. IF WE CAN DRILL DOWN ON WHAT IS NOT LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO FIND THAT- IT MORE NARROW TERMS I THINK. HOPEFULLY BRING SOME ASSURANCE IN A LITTLE MORE- I. THE FORTY VOTES THANK YOU THANKS FOR READING THOSE ISSUES THAT OKAY. THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS OKAY SAYING NONE- THE FOR THE SENATE CERTAIN I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD DIFFICULTY OVER LAST WEEK- AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO- ADDITIONAL WORK ON THE BILL I THINK WE'VE HEARD IN THE DIALOGUE HERE A LOT OF ISSUES- FOR EXAMPLE- AND YOU BROUGHT UP AND WE DISCUSSED ACTUALLY THE CURRENT THE- RIGHT TO WATER IT'S IN AND STATE LAW IN FACT I REMEMBER VOTING FOR THE CENTER MONIES BILL. BUT YOU LOOK AT THOSE THE LANGUAGE AROUND THAT BILL SO FIRST OF ALL I WANNA SAY THAT I APPRECIATE ASPIRATION RIGHT SO I THINK- APPRECIATE THE ASPIRATION THAT THIS THIS BILL REPRESENTS- THE- AS WE TALKED ABOUT. THE OF THE RATE OF WATER WHAT YOU REFER TO IN BOTH YOUR TESTIMONY WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT BILL. IS THE FINANCIAL DEBT JUST TO CLEAR THE RIGHT. THE RELY DEFINITIONS AROUND IT IS TO SAY YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO'S RESPONSIBLE OTHER TITLE IT IT'S THE CENTER RIGHT SO YOU TALK ABOUT DEL SAYING THAT YOU'LL TAKE AN AMENDMENT TO. PRINT RIGHT PROGRAM ACTUALLY SO IT WAS A HOUSE THAT ENACTED WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE A RIGHT A WATER RATES SO- SO THERE'S A LOT OF. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE ASPIRATION DRIVES A LOT OF. DETAIL STILL TO BE WORKED OUT- I THINK YOU KNOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MONEY BUILD BRAG ANDRE WATERS PERHAPS THESE A TEMPLATE. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WITH DIFFERENT TOPICS RIGHT SO IT'S NOT I WAS GONNA BE THE SAME. AS A PERHAPS A TEMPLATE FOR HOW YOUR BILL COULD DEFAULT- THERE ARE A LOT OF STILL QUESTIONS OUT THERE- SO. YEAH SO I GUESS WHAT I'M GONNA SAY IS THAT I KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS IS THAT IN AN FOR SO I WANT TO JUST SAVE. FRONT OF ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DO ON. THE SCRIPT ANYONE FROM VOTING FOR THIS BILL- OF THE PERSONALLY MIKE. IS THE- IS YEAR THE COMMITTEE IS THAT IT'S THEIR SOUL SO MUCH WORK TO BE DONE. AND CERTAINLY ONE OF TRY TO WORK AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP USE THAT EVOLVES. THAT I DON'T PERSONALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE TO SAY TAT I'M GONNA PUT MY PERSONAL STAMP ON IT WITH AN AYE VOTE. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY OPEN ENDED QUESTIONS THAT STILL HAVE YET TO BE SORTED OUT. SO I DON'T DISCOURAGE ANYONE COMMITTEE FROM VOTING FOR THE BILL TO ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ASPIRATION BUT- THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT STILL TO BE DONE. AND FORTUNATELY YOU KNOW WEIRD THE- DOORS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT BEFORE WE GOT TO THIS YEAR THIS IS THE LAST POLICY HEARING- I KNOW THE AND YELLOW BE SURE AND THEN OF COURSE EVERY TIME YOU PUT IN MORE DETAIL. THAN STAKEHOLDERS START HAVING DIFFERENT OPINIONS AS WELL SO RIGHT NOW PEOPLE LOOK AT THE ASPIRATION THE OUT AND WE'RE LIKE A YEAH HEY WE ALL LIKE THAT BUT THEN. HOUSE OPERATIONALIZE DOES GET TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IS SOME OF THE MEMBERS APPOINTED OUT. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION LOOKING FORWARD TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS WHETHER THIS BILL PASSES OR NOT BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETHING YOU CARE ABOUT. SOMETHING THAT ALL OF US CARE ABOUT. WHAT A HEALTH PARTNER WITH YOU AND FIGURE THAT OUT- SO- SO I'M JUST PERSONALLY GONNA LAY OFF BECAUSE- I DON'T FEEL THAT THE BILLS. AND STUFF TYPE OF FORM I FEEL COMFORTABLE DOING BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF IT MOVES FORWARD TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON IT PEOPLE WANT TO CONTINUE TO. MOVE WORK ON THIS ASPIRATION. THEN I'M THAT'S GREAT AND THE LET'S KEEP WORKING ON- IS A- FOR SO WITH THAT. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT SPACE IN THAT THAT- YOUR YOUR HIGH STANDARD IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I WOULD JUST SAY- A LANGUAGE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING TODAY. SIR IF YOU EXACTLY TO THAT RIGHT TO WATER FRAMEWORK- WOULD DO. OPERATIONALIZE THIS IS A SORT OF SHALL CONSIDER KIND OF CONCEPT BUT WITHOUT A MANDATE OR A LITIGATION OPPORTUNITY- BUT LOOK AS I SAID IT'S BILL ON ITS OWN IS NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS OR THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THAT SPACE- BUT I DO THINK WE'LL- WE NEED TO. SET OUR TERMS HERE AND AS WE ENGAGE IN THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONVERSATION IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR ON HOW TO HELP. KEEP OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE FROM LITERALLY DYING ON OUR STREETS THE KIND OF PEOPLE THAT DR PART TOVEY LOSING EVERY SINGLE DAY I CANNOT IMAGINE. MEDICAL DOCTOR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU HAVE TAKE A HIPPOCRATIC OATH. AND GO OUT TO DO YOUR WORK. AND THEN. THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO FULFILL THAT DUTY BUT YOU- WE NEED TO HELP OUR DOCTORS OUR PATIENTS AND THE PEOPLE OUT THERE SUFFERING- FIND A BETTER WAY SO I BELIEVE HOUSING MEALS IS THAT WAY. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE NOD FROM CENTER EGGMAN IN HER LEADERSHIP THIS YEAR AND I'M HITCHING MY WAGON TO HER STAR. AND I WOULD JUST REALLY APPRECIATE YOU ALL GIVEN ME SOME SPACE BEFORE THE FLOOR TO TRY TO PUT SOME WORK PRODUCT BEFORE YOU THAT THAT MAKES SENSE IN THIS LARGER CONTEXT- AND HOPEFULLY OUR DRIVER. SO THAT EXPECTATIONS FOR. ARCTIC AND SHE WAS SECONDED ALREADY REMOVED VEGAS MOVED BY SENTIMENTS OF THE FIGHTERS OKAY SO THE MOTIONS DO PASSED THE FIRST RE REFER TO COMMITTEE APPROPRIATIONS MOVE BY CENTER EGGMAN. CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL PAN. MELINDA'S WINDOWS NO EGGMAN EGGMAN HI GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I A GROVE HER TADO HER TITLE BY LEYVA VOTING LIMON. FROTH ALL RIGHT ROTH FIVE RUBIO LIMON HI THIS IS THAT EVERYBODY BECAUSE THEY I NEED A LOGO OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THAT FILLS OUT SEVEN ONE THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANKS OKAY I THINK THE LAST ITEMS BEFORE WE GET TO SEND CALENDARS I'M NUMBER FIFTEEN SB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT WHICH IS MINE SO HE ON THE GAVEL OVER TO. MELENDEZ WELCOME. THANK YOU THE FINAL ITEM ON OUR AGENDA TODAY. IS SENATOR PAN'S BILL WHICH IS ITEM NUMBER FIFTEEN SB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT. YEAH OKAY- YOU'RE PRESENTING OKAY AND AS OUR CHAIRMAN MAKES HIS WAY- OVER TO THE PODIUM. MIRO IN CAN TKE A DEEP BREATH SENATOR PAN WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- LIGHTS YOUR BELINDA'S SENATORS- FOR SOME TIME PLEASE PRESENT SB EIGHT THIRTY EIGHT- DRESSES ACTUALLY- JINDRAK DRUG MANUFACTURING PARTICULARLY- INSULIN TELL US BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS- TO DROP THE POLICY COMMENT ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ALICE'S TO ENSURE TO ANY CONTRACT ENTERING INTO. TWO FOR MANUFACTURE GENERIC DRUGS INCLUDES MEASURABLE OUTCOMES- YEAH BACK IN TWENTY TWENTY- I AUTHORED WE PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO WHICH REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO PARTNER WITH A DRUG MAKER. TO MANUFACTURE GENERIC DRUGS AND- SO WE KNOW WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH BOTH ONE THE EXPENSE OF DROVE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS- HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND EXPENSE THAT COSTS CALIFORNIANS INTO ACTUALLY RELIABLE ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE GENERIC MEDICATION SO FOR SOME. GENERIC PHARMACEUTICALS- THERE MAY ONLY BE ONE SUPPLIER WHICH EITHER OF THAT SUPPLIER HAS A MAJOR SECTION PROBLEM SUDDENLY NOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE OR IT GETS BOUGHT OUT AND THEN SOMEONE UP THE PRICE RATE AND CERTAINLY NOW YOU'RE IN- SO THE IDEA WOULD BE IS THAT TO HAVE CALIFORNIA. TAKE A LEAD AND ACTUALLY MANUFACTURING GENERIC MEDICATIONS IN A STRATEGIC WAY TO LOWER COSTS FOR PARTICULAR KEY GENERIC MEDICATIONS ARE NECESSARY. FOR CALIFORNIANS AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. IN THE MARKET AS WELL AND- SO SINCE THE PASSAGE IN TWENTY TWENTY OF SB EIGHT FIFTY TWO- THE DEMONSTRATIONS BEGAN THIS. AND PARTICULARLY IN THAT BILL WE IDENTIFIED CALIFORNIA LABEL INSULIN. AND IN FACT- THE- THERE'S PROGRESS IN AND TRYING TO IDENTIFY AWAY FOR CALIFORNIA PARTICIPATE IN. THE ASSURING THAT WE CAN GET INSULIN SO THIS BILL FURTHERS THAT WORK BY EXPLICITLY REQUIRING THE- CAL THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP INSOLENT IN AND TO ESTABLISH A CALIFORNIA BASED MANUFACTURING FACILITY. FOR GENERICS WITH THE INTENT OF CREATING HIGH SKILL HIGH- HIGH PAYING JOBS. THIS POLICY IS MORE IMPORTANT ENDEAVOR I THINK THE COVE NINETEEN CRISIS IS CERTAINLY PANDEMIC IS SHOWN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS HAVE THE RELIABLE SUPPLY CHAIN- AND TO HAVE RELIABLE SUPPLIES OF. WHETHER IT'S- WELL CERTAINLY WE TALK ABOUT THE P. BUT YOU KNOW MEDICAID MEDICATIONS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AS AS WELL- AND SO. IT'S TO BE ABLE TO HELP HAVE CAPACITY IN OUR OWN STATE. WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT- CAL. ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE MEDICATIONS THEY NEED THEY NEED TO SETTING UP THE STRUCTURE IN. WHICH THE CALIFORNIA HAS ITS OWN DRUG MANUFACTURING CAPACITY WILL HELP THE STATE PREPARE FOR OTHER TYPES OF CRISES AS WELL. SO WITH THAT- I AM PLEASED TO HAVE A JOKE ABOUT THOSE FROM THE A. R. P.
