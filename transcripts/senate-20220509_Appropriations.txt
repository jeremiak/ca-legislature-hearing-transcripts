CONTRA COSTA FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE ALL RIGHT WE'RE ON WE'RE ON SUPPORT OF FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE SERVE YOU THERE FOR OPPOSITION JUST. STAY PUT WE'RE GOING TO FINISH UP WITH WORK FOURTEEN SEVENTY NINE. CHARLIE NINE NINE Q. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE ONE LEAD WITNESS IN OPPOSITION DR JONATHAN SACRISTAN FROM REOPEN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HE'S ON THE PHONE LINE AND JONATHAN YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JONATHAN JACKSON FOUNDER OF REAL CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS WORKED AND WAS NOT WORK TO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS OPEN. EACH WITH THEIR OWN COST ONE OF THESE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SEVENTY PROGRAMS BUT IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THEIR COSTS ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT ON THEM CAN BE MUCH BETTER USED IN OTHER AREAS TO MAKE UP FOR MASSIVE LEARNING LIST. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVE AN INDEFINITE TESTING PROGRAM IN LINE WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FAVORITE REQUIREMENT THAT EVEN CDPH DOESN'T PLACE ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THE REASON YOU COULD DOESN'T WORK. THEIR OWN TESTING TO BE FOLLOWED. IS BECAUSE ALL SCHOOLS FOLLOWED HAS WRITTEN TODAY IF WE REQUIRE SCHOOLS. APPROXIMATELY HALF THE STUDENT POPULATION REGULARLY. AT A COST OF ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY FOR THE TEST HELLO. AND AS WE'VE SEEN FROM THE PAGE FREQUENTLY UPDATES OR SCHOOL. THESE CANGES COULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS RAMP UP TESTING WITHOUT ANY NOTICE AND AN UNTOLD COSTS. THE COULD ALLOW SCHOOLS REDUCE TESTING PER SCHOOL WOULD HAVE ALREADY INCURRED THE COST AND NOT EASILY BE ABLE TO RAMP DOWN. EITHER WAY FOLKS KNOWS ARE COSTLY TO SCHOOL DISTRICT UNCERTAINTY FROM SOME STATEMENT IT'S OFTEN ARE. I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE TESTING PROGRAM NOT THE FOLLOW IS L. A. U. S. D.'S. WHICH IS THE DIRECTION THE BILL'S AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE REST OF CALIFORNIA. ONLY A FEW TEST EVERY STUDENT AND STAFF WEEKLY THEIR NATIONAL TESTING PROGRAM BUDGET WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION. NOW THAT THE SCHOOL YEAR'S ALMOST OVER IT IS ESTIMATED TO COST FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION NEARLY FOUR TIMES THE INITIAL BUDGET. IF THEY'RE SAME PROGRAMS APPLY STATEWIDE WHICH USUALLY TOPIC EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS WELL ABOVE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THE BILL'S AUTHOR. IS ASKING FOR. THE BILL'S ALSO OFFER ALSO TARGETED. THAT HE CONDUCTED IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OF OVER TWO HUNDRED SCHOOLS WHICH IS SIMILAR TO ELLIE IS DETECTING PLANETS IN THESE PROGRAMS IT COSTS OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO IDENTIFY A SINGLE POSITIVE TEST MOST OF WHICH COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN IDENTIFIED MUCH LESS COSTLY MEASURES. THESE ARE JUST THE COST OF THE TEST ALONE THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. HIGHER MINIMUM OF ONE TO TWO ADDITIONAL STAFF. BUT THIS LIKELY WOULD BE EXCEEDED TO KEEP UP WITH THE CP JUST TESTING THE RAMS ON TOP OF THIS THE BILL ANALYSIS ESTIMATES ESTIMATES THAT ONE A ONE TIME COST TO CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DISTRICTS. OF OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. LASTLY THIS BILL WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ATTENDANCE THUS IPACTING TDA FUNDING GOING BACK TO L. A. U. S. T. THEIR WEEKLY TESTING ACCORDING PROGRAM LED TO THEM HAVING ONE OF THE WORST. CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM RATES IN CALIFORNIA WITH ALMOST HALF OF ALL STUDENTS BEING CHRONICALLY ABSENT SCHOOL YEAR WHICH IS ABOUT DOUBLE THE STATE AVERAGE. THE LOWER DEFINITE ABOUT WASHING EIGHTY FUNDING TO L. A. U. S. B. IS EIGHTY MILLION. WITH ALL OF THE TESTING COST. THERE WAS NO IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES ONLY WORSE FINANCIAL OUTCOMES AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT A STUDENT'S EDUCATION. I ASKED THE PREPARATIONS COMMITTEE TO THE BILL SB FOURTEEN FIFTY NINE THE BILL THAT. WOULD IMPLEMENT A COSTLY CAN DEFINITELY MANY PROGRAM. AND INSTEAD IS A THE FUNDING IT. PROGRAMS ACTUALLY BENEFIT CAL. STATE THANK. THANK YOU. TO MINUTES AND FIFTY ONCE. ALL RIGHT COME ON UP. RACHEL I. GAVE L. A. COUNTY REFUGE AN OPPOSITE.
