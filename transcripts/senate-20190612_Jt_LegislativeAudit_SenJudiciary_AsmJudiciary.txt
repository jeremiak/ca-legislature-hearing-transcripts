LEGISLATIVE AUDIT THE DRUG HEARING BETWEEN THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. SENATE JUDICIARY ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO ORDER -- TODAY WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE HONOR AN AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR -- TITLED COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WEAKNESS IN ITS OVERSIGHT. HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO PERSIST. AS MOST -- PRESENT HERE TODAY ALREADY KNOW THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING THE COMPLAINTS [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THIS MORNING WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. IN AN AUDIT REPORT RELEASED IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR TITLED COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WEAKNESS IN ITS OVERSIGHT HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO PERSIST. AS MOST PRESENT HERE TODAY ALREADY KNOW THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS ABOUT MISCONDUCT BY JUDGES. AND THEN DECIDING TO WHAT EXTENT TO DISCIPLINE IS APPROPRIATE I WANT TO THANK SENATOR JACKSON'S ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE IN ASSEMBLY WOMAN -- CRISTINA GARCIA FOR REQUEST IN THE AUDIT WE WILL DISCUSS. THANK YOU ALSO FOR YOUR INTEREST IN HAVING OVERSIGHT HEARING TODAY. I'D SAY WE WILL ALSO BE DISCUSSING THE RESULTS OF THE AUDIT THE AUDIT. REPORT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED SOME THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE AT THE COMMISSION TO IMPROVE ITS PROCESSES. FOR INVESTIGATING IN HANDLING ALLEGATIONS RELATED TO JUDGES. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE COMMISSION NEEDS -- TO ONE INSURED ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATES ALLEGATIONS OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT BY HAVING HE INVESTIGATORS DOCUMENT THEIR INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES. HAVING MANAGERIAL REVIEW OF INVESTIGATIONS AND HAVING INVESTIGATORS REVIEWED CONSIDER ALL PRIOR COMPLAINTS. ON A JUDGE. THE COMMISSION ALSO NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND ACCESSIBLE% TO THE PUBLIC BY ACCEPTING COMPLAINTS ON ITS WEBSITE. AND HOLDING PUBLIC HEARINGS WITHOUT THESE CHANGES THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATOR PROCESS COULD. COULD ALLOW JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO GO UNDETECTED AND THEN CORRECTED LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION TODAY REGARDING THE AUDIT RESULTS. AND WHAT THE COMMISSION IS DOING TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT. I TRUST AND HOPE THAT THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS I BEFORE PROCEEDING FURTHER A FEW HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS TO ENSURE THAT. WE HEAR FROM EVERYONE ASK THAT THE PANELS KEEP THEIR PRESENTATIONS TO THE TIME ALLOTTED AS EARLY FIFTEEN MINUTES FOR THE STATE AUDITOR. AT TEN MINUTES FOR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL REVIEW. AND THE FINAL. FINAL PANEL HAVE ABOUT TEN MINUTES FOR THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LONG CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION WE'LL RESERVE TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END. AFTER THE LAST Q. AND A PERIOD. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH AN OPENING FROM OUR CHAIRS. SO SENATE JACKSON GEORGIA YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR QUITE SOME TIME WANT TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS AND YOUR STAFF FOR TAKING THE LEAD IN ORGANIZING. OF THIS HEARING -- IDEA TOOK THE LEAD IN REQUESTING THE AUDIT AND TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONG WITH -- THOSE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD INDICATED INCLUDING MY COUNTERPART IN THE ASSEMBLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATION OF THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. SO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COURT SYSTEM I AM SOMEWHAT SURPRISED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST PEOPLE TODAY REALLY DON'T HAVE AN APPRECIATION FOR THE ROLE OF THE COURTS THEY ARE. BONTA ABILITIES TO ADD AS AN INDEPENDENT CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT SO. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INDEPENDENCE AND CO EQUAL. STATUS ALONG WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN HEARING -- TODAY ON A NATIONAL LEVEL -- EFFORTS TO IMPUGN THE INTEGRITY OF OUR COURT SYSTEM WHICH DOES -- THEN THREATEN OUR DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM. HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE -- IT'S BEEN KIND OF A BUMPY ROAD IN ACTUALLY HAVING THE AUDIT CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED THERE WAS A COURT CHALLENGE TO THE AUDIT EVEN BEING. ABLE TO PROCEED -- BUT I WANT. TO PUT THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE ORGANIZATION WHO I BELIEVE IS. HIGHLY POSITION AND QUALIFIED TO MOVE THE C. J. P. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO ENHANCE. THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE FAIR AND EFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. WHICH REQUIRES POLITICAL NEUTRALITY AND INDEPENDENCE WE KNOW THERE ARE INHERENT CONFLICTS THAT EXIST IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM IT IS BY NATURE AN ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM. SO THERE IS OFTEN A WINNER AND A LOSER IN A COURT EXPERIENCE AND THE LOSER IS NEVER HAPPY IN OFTENTIMES WANTS TO PLACE THE BLAME ON A JUDGE. INSTEAD OF THE LAW OR SOMETIMES ON COUNCIL AND HAVING PRACTICED LAW FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AS A LITIGATOR. I KNOW THAT PART OF THE WELL -- UNFORTUNATELY THAT -- WHEN SOMEONE LOSES A CASE -- FREQUENTLY THEY LOOK TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT LOSS. AND FREQUENTLY THAT ISN'T THE CASE AND ON OCCASION IT IS AND I THINK THAT'S WHEN WE LOOK TO THE COURTS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IS BEING DONE FAIR FAIRLY AND IMPARTIALLY. SO -- AND AND DON'T WANT TO DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE IN FACT SOME BAD ACTORS WHO ARE JUDGES AND THAT I SEE IS THE ROLE OF THE C. JP BUT I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE A FUNCTIONING JUDICIAL SYSTEM. JUDGES NEED NOT BE AFRAID SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S A BALANCE THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING SOME OF THE THOUGHTS OF THE AUDITOR AND OTHERS WHO TESTIFYING TODAY ON MAINTAINING THAT BALANCE SO. I HOPE WE KEEP THAT PERSPECTIVE TODAY AS WE GO FORWARD AND WITH THAT AGAIN THANK. REMEMBER SALAS FOR HOLDING THIS PROCEEDING. THANK SENATOR LET'S GO TO MOVE. TO MR STONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN THE CULTURES CONSTRUCT THAT WE OPERATE UNDER WITH THE SEPARATION OF POWERS OUR RULES THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY CLEAR THAT WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OBLIGATIONS OVER THERE THE TWO BRANCHES. PART OF THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE AND OUR OVERSIGHT OF THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. HAS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT ALWAYS BÃ N. ADDRESS STORE LOOKED AT OVER THE HISTORY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. WORKING WITH THE SENATE JUDICIARY MY COUNTERPART THERE WE'VE TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT HOW THE STATE BAR FUNCTIONS AND THEIR OBLIGATION OF PUBLIC PROTECTION. AND AS WE WORK WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ONE OF THE ASPECTS THAT CAME TO LIGHT IS THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE AND MODERNIZING THEIR APPROACH. SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THE FUNCTION OF THE JUDICIARY YES MOST ALL OF THE JUDGES. TAKE THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC OTHER OBLIGATIONS ON THE CONSTITUTION VERY SERIOUSLY HOWEVER WE HAVE HANDED JUDGES LAWYERS AND OTHER SUCH SIGNIFICANT POWER THAT WHEN ABUSES HAPPEN. THIS IS UNDERMINE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN THE ABILITY OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH TO FUNCTION AND THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENT HONESTLY TO FUNCTION. SO THAT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THE WATCH DOGS IF YOU WILL OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. NEED TO BE. CLEAR NEED TO BE STRONG NEED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE PROCESSES SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN FEEL THAT THEIR GRIEVANCES OR HEARD. AND DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY AS IS POINTED OUT AND AS AS I THINK WILL BE CLEAR AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. JUDGES GET LOTS OF COMPLAINTS LODGED AGAINST THEM AND MANY OF THEM ARE. BECAUSE OF THE DECISION THAT WAS MADE -- BECAUSE OF THE THE PROCESS THAT THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL FELT WAS UNFAIR CG PAY DOES NOT OVERSEE THE JUST THE DECISIONS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE APPEAL PROCESS IT DOES NOT OVERSEE. THE BY THE WAY OR THAT THE ULTIMATE DECISION THAT A JUDGE MAKES THE OUTCOMES OF THE COURT BUT OVERSEAS THE JUDICIAL. OFFICERS AS THEY DELIBERATE AS THEY MANAGE THEIR COURTROOMS. UNDER THE OBLIGATIONS OF ETHICS AND ON THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL. EXPECT OUR JUDICIAL OFFICERS TO WHO THEY THEY ARE IN OUR COMMUNITY. SO. INDIVIDUALS GREAT AUTHORITY WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT AUTHORITIES BEING. LEVIED APPROPRIATELY AND THE WAY THAT WE WOULD EXPECT THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT PROCESS HAS COME UP QUITE A BIT SHORT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE. STANDS READY TO DO WHAT WE NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE STATUTES THE LAWS EVEN THE CONSTITUTION ARE APPROPRIATELY MODIFIED SO THAT CGP CAN FUNCTION AND BUILD BACK THIS TRUST WITH THE PUBLIC. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE THE HEARING TODAY GETTING A SENSE OF WHERE WE NEED TO GO PRECIADO THE AUDITOR'S HARD WORK ON THIS I KNOW IT WAS A BIT OF A BUMPY ROAD AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS. BUT THE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK ARE FAIRLY CLEAR THEY GIVE US ALL PLACES WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE AND BE BETTER AND WE BY WE I MEAN THE GOVERNMENT ALL THREE BRANCHES OF THE GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THAT THIS HEARING THAT SERVES AS A PUBLIC. VETTING OF THOSE IDEAS OF THOSE PROCESSES AND THEN WECAN MOVE FORWARD ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MOST EFFECTIVE. AND TRUSTED JUDICIAL BRANCH THAT WE CAN HAVE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS IT FROM US SENATOR JACKSON'S IN SO WITH MEMBER SO THE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEES -- OUR GOAL HERE IS REALLY TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC FEELS THAT. THEY'RE GETTING THEIR FAIR SHAKE IF WE CAN IF WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN SAY THAT -- LET'S GO IN AND JUST START LET'S BEGIN WITH -- ITEM NUMBER TWO THE EVERY OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I'D LIKE TO INVITE -- OUR STATE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MISSILE EIGHT HOW -- BOB HARRIS OF PRINCIPAL AND SENIOR EDITOR KATIE HAD TO THAT HOUSE. SO WHEN YOU'RE READY BY TOPIC. MIKE IS ON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ACTUALLY CHAIR SALAS JACKSON AND STONE MEMBERS OF THE RESPECTIVE COMMITTEES FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ELAINE HOWELL AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. TO MY RIGHT IS KATIE CARDINIA SO SHE WAS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND BOB PARIS IS TO HER RIGHT HE WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AS WELL -- WHAT I INTEND TO DO IN MY PRESENTATION IS GO THROUGH THE KEY ISSUES AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL -- I BELIEVE THE SERGEANT HAS HANDED OUT. SOME GRAPHICS THAT. MY OFFICE THERE PULLED FROM THE AUDIT REPORT MS CARDENAS WILL STEP USE. THOSE GRAPHICS DOES WILL SERVE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE KEY ISSUES THAT IDENTIFY AND MY AND MY REMARKS BUT I WILL KEEP MINE AT A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL. SO WE HAD THREE KEY AREAS IN THE AUDIT REPORT THE FIRST WAS RELATED TO THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESSES -- THAT CJ P. ENGAGES IN A TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT THE SECOND AREA IS RELATED TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. AND THE THIRD IS ON THEIR OPERATIONS THEIR EFFICIENCIES -- AND CERTAINLY ON TRANSPARENCY. SO GOING BACK TO THE FIRST AREA INVESTIGATIVE PROCESSES WE FOUND WEAKNESSES ACTUALLY -- IN THEIR INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS WE FELT THAT THEY WERE NOT TAKING THEIR INVESTIGATORS WERE NOT TAKING ALL REASONABLE STEPS. A TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AND THAT INCLUDED NOT NECESSARILY INTERVIEWING ALL OF THE RELEVANT WITNESSES OBSERVING JUDGES IN THE COURT ROOM. OBTAINING ALL OF THE NECESSARY EVIDENCE WE WE HAD CONCERNS -- AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE CASES THAT THAT WE SAMPLED ARE SELECTED. WE SAW THAT THE THE CJ PETERS NOT LOOKING FOR PATTERNS OF COMPLAINT TAKE A BIT AGAINST A PARTICULAR JUDGE THAT MAY FURTHER INFORM -- THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO OPEN UP AN INVESTIGATION -- I TO ACTUALLY CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS SECTION OF THE REPORT IS THEIR WRISTS REAL NO SUPERVISORY REVIEW OF THE INVESTIGATORS THEY HAVE A LOT OF DISCRETION. IN DETERMINING WHAT THEIR ACTIONS WILL BE TO INVESTIGATE AN ALLEGATION THERE'S NO ONE REALLY ADVISING THEM ARE MONITORING WHAT THEY'RE DOING FROM A SUPERVISORY PERSPECTIVE. ON BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE FEDERAL AG'S THEY PUT SOME BEST BEST PRACTICES OUT. BAR ASSOCIATION HAS SOME BEST PRACTICES RELATED TO CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS MY OFFICE AS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE IS RESPONSIBLE. FOR OTHER WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT WE HAVE INVESTIGATORS AND AND BEST PRACTICES SUGGEST THAT YOU COME UP WITH AN INVESTIGATIVE PLAN. AND THAT PLAN SHOULD LAY OUT AT LEAST THE THE INITIAL STEPS THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE TO INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATIONS SOME TIME FRAMES -- SOME PARTICULAR APPROACHES AND SUPERVISORY REVIEW ADVICE IS TO OKAY WE'VE WE'VE RECEIVED THIS TYPE OF EVIDENCE I THINK WE NEED ADDITIONAL. WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO BE BEFORE WE DECIDE EITHER CLOSE THIS CASE OR CONTINUE SO CHECKING IN. A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THIS SECTION OF THE REPORT THAT WE THINK WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IS A PERIODIC QUALITY REVIEW. OF THE CASES ARE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A DECISION TO CLOSE THE CASE OR CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THERE NEEDS TO BE. THAT EXTERNAL. AS WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT THERE IS A LEGAL ADVISER THAT IS AVAILABLE TO SEE J. P. THAT PERSON IS NOT. INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS THERE FOR HERE SHE COULD SERVE AS THAT PERIODIC REVIEW ARE LOOKING AT A HANDFUL OF CASES. TO TO PROVIDE THAT QUALITY CONTROL OVER AND ABOVE WHAT A SUPERVISOR OR MANAGER MAY BE PROVIDING TO INVESTIGATORS O A VARIETY OF DITION IS DIFFERENT ISSUES RELATED TO THEIR INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS WE THINK THEY COULD DO. A BETTER JOB A MORE THOROUGH JOB OF LOOKING AT SOME OF THESE ALLEGATIONS AND INVESTIGATING THEM FULLY AND AS I SAID SOME OF THE GRAPHICS THAT -- IS CARDENAS WILL STEP YOU THROUGH WILL ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THAT. SECOND ISSUE IS RELATED TO SEE BATES CJ PLEASE STRUCTURE. AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY THEIR STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IS UNITARY STRUCTURE SINGLE BODY SO THAT BODY NOT ONLY CONDUCTS THE INVESTIGATIONS BUT ALSO MAKES THE DECISIONS AS TO WHETHER WHAT TYPE OF DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT -- IN THE EVENT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE SUBSTANTIATED -- BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE ARE SUGGESTING THERE NEEDS TO BE A BI CAMERAL WHERE THERE'S AN INVEST SEPARATE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTION AND THAT IN. FOR BY THE TO A SEPARATE BODY THAT MAKES A DECISION. RELATED TO WHAT TYPE OF DISCIPLINE AGAIN SHOULD BE. SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT -- WE LOOKED AT OTHER STATES WE SAW THAT SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES HAVE A BI CAMERAL -- STRUCTURE. AS AS OPPOSED TO UNITARY STRUCTURE SO WE WE CERTAINLY HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT. ONE ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED THAT WHERE AT CJ P. DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY IS. TO EXERCISE OR REQUIRE CORRECTIVE ACTION. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE BAR MAY REQUIRE AN ATTORNEY TO TAKE TRAINING OR TO GO INTO A SUBSTANCE ABUSE THERE'S A LAWYER'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IF SOMEONE HAS A SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUE. MEDICAL BOARD HAS SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE DOES NOT HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THAT TYPE OF CORRECTIVE ACTION WHERE WHERE A JUDGE SHOULD BE TAKING SOME ETHICS TRAINING PERHAPS OR SOME OTHER TYPES OF TRAINING. TO STRENGTHEN THEIR ABILITY TO SERVE ON THE BENCH. NOW WE DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND WE DO THIS IN THE REPORT THAT CJ P. ACTUALLY DEVELOPED A PILOT PROGRAM. AND IT'S A MENTORING PROGRAM WHERE IT'S REALLY MORE SEASON JUDGES WHO ARE WELL RESPECTED JUDGES SERVE AS MENTORS TO OTHER JUDGES TO REALLY HELP THEM. MODIFY THEIR BEHAVIOR OR YOU KNOW CARRY OUT THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND IN THE MOST PROFESSIONAL ETHICAL WAY AND THAT MENTORING PROGRAM -- HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND NOW THEY INTEND AS WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT THEY MADE A DECISION TO THEY STARTED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY DECIDED THEY WANTED. TO CARRY THAT OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR JUDGES TO BE MENTORED SO WE THINK THAT'S IT THAT'S A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- AS AS THE CHAIRS OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MENTIONED SOME OF THESE CHANGES WILL REQUIRE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT -- AND WE DO HAVE A RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THAT -- AND AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ISSUES AND AGAIN MISS CARDENAS WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THOSE. SO STRUCTURALLY THERE WE THINK THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH A UNITARY STRUCTURE THERE NEEDS TO BE A BI CAMERAL. OUR STRUCTURE IF WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES. THE LAST AREA -- THAT I WILL QUICKLY GO OVER IS TRANCE -- TRANSPARENCY AND MODERNIZATION. SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBERS WHO ASKED US TO COULD CONDUCT THIS AUDIT IS HOW WELL OUR OUR CALIFORNIANS BEING INFORMED ABOUT CJ PEAS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. AND AND OUR CONCLUSION WAS NOT VERY WELL -- THEY DO CONDUCT OUTREACH -- BUT THE PRIMARY AUDIENCE FOR THEIR OUT REACH IS LEGAL PROFESSIONALS IN COURT EMPLOYEES. SO YOU WITH THE JUDICIARY PROCESS IN FACT WHEN WE LOOKED AT A FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE SAW NONE OF THE EVENTS THAT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED WERE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO REALLY EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS TO FILE A COMPLAINT. HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT -- AND HOW TO GO THROUGH THAT PARTICULAR PROCESS SO WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF OUT REACH WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC -- IN DEALING WITH THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES SO MEDICAL BOARD AND SOME OTHER REGULATORY OUR BOARDS. REQUIRE -- POSTING OF INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST A PHYSICIAN C. J. P. DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY RIGHT NOW TO REQUIRE COURTS TO POST THIS INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW A PERSON IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC COULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH C. J. P. IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE THE JUDGE IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASES IS. I'M NOT CARRYING HIMSELF OR HERSELF OUT PROFESSIONALLY OR IS ENGAGING IN MISCONDUCT SO THERE NEEDS TO BE -- SOME ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE POSTED RIGHT THERE IN THE COURT ROOM -- CURRENTLY CJ PIECE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO FILE A COMPLAINT ONLINE SO IF YOU WANT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH C. J. P. YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT THAT COMPLAINT IN THE MAIL. THAT'S ARCHAIC -- A LOT OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY. TO ALLOW FOLKS TO FILE A COMPLAINT ONLINE SO WE HAVE -- RECOMMENDATION IN THE REPORT THAT THE THE C. J. P. REALLY NEEDS. TO GET A BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT. INVESTMENT IN COST IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES AND OUR ANALYSES OF SYSTEMS OUT THERE WE THINK THEY COULD USE PURPOSE PERHAPS AN OFF THE SHELF SYSTEM WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS. SO THEY COULD HAVE A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD THEN ALLOW THEM TO ACCEPT COMPLAINTS ELECTRONICALLY. AND THEN THE LAST AREA THAT I WILL TALK ABOUT NINE AM IS GUARDIANS WILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE GRAPHICS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED OUT IS LOOKING AT THEIR RESOURCES IN THE EFFICIENCIES. I WE THINK THEY COULD BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND DEVOTE MORE OF THEIR RESOURCES TO THEIR THEIR PRIMARY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY WHAT WE SAW IS ABOUT. 40% OF THEIR BUDGET IS SPENT ON NON CORE FUNCTIONS ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES OP SO WE THINK THAT THEY NEED TO DO AN OVERALL ANALYSIS AND REALLY DETERMINE. WHERE THEY SHOULD BE INVESTING THEIR TIME AND THEIR RESOURCES TO MAKE THEIR THEIR OPERATIONS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT CERTAINLY AN ONLINE SYSTEM? A BETTER CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT. OUR TRACKING OF A COMPLAINTS DETERMINING WHETHER THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS SEVERAL SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AGAINST A PARTICULAR JUDGE -- SO WE THINK THAT THERE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR MORE EFFICIENT OPERATIONS. FOR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. I WANT STEP THROUGH ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS MISS CARDING US AGAIN IT'S IN IT'S IN THE HAND OUT BUT OF COURSE THERE IS THE PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO NEEDING A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND THAT'S NOT JUST RELATED TO THE THE GOING FROM A UNITARY STRUCTURE TO A BI CAMERAL. IT IT'S RELATED TO SOME OF THEIR pCORRECTIVE ACTION SOME OF THE OTHER AUTHORITY THAT WE BELIEVE NEEDS TO BE CLEARLY STATED. IN THE CONSTITUTION AS IT WITH RESPECT TO SEE JP'S ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR AUTHORITY. IN THE MEANTIME WE THINK SEE JP COULD TAKE SOME STEPS. TO IMPROVE SOME OF THEIR PROCESSES THEY CAN ALREADY DO SOME OF THE OUT REACH WE BELIEVE EVEN IF THEY DON'T WE SUGGEST AN APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR CASE MANAGEMENT WE STILL BELIEVE EVEN IF THEY DON'T GET THAT APPROPRIATION. THEY CAN FIND A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- TO COME UP WITH THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYTEM WE ALSO THINK THEY NEED TO HIRE AN INVESTIGATIVE MANAGER. WHO CAN OVERSEE THE INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE CONDUCTING -- THE INVESTIGATIONS AND GIVE THEM GUIDANCE DID TO MAKE SURE IT'S FULLY VETTING THE ALLEGATIONS AND LOOKING AT ALL OF THE EVIDENCE INTERVIEWING APPROPRIATE INDIVIDUALS GOING INTO THE COURTROOM OBSERVING JUDGES. THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO WE HAVE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE SEE JP CAN IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY -- SO THAT THEIR OPERATIONS ARE ARE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT -- AND THEY CERTAINLY CAN EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND A BETTER WAY THAN THEY HAVE IN THE PAST SO WITH THAT MEMBERS I WILL TURN IT OVER TO TO MISS CARDEW EUNICE AND SHE WILL. USING THE HAND OUTS WILL KIND OF STEP YOU THROUGH THE SAME ISSUES BUT IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL AND I AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL FURTHER ILLUSTRATE THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN THE REPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATIE CORTINAS AND I WAS THE SENIOR AUDITOR ON THIS PROJECT. IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE TWO I WILL GO OVER THE FIRST MAJOR FINDING FROM THE FIRST CHAPTER OF OUR REPORT. OUR TEAM FOUND THAT CDP FAILED TO THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATE ONE THIRD OF THE CASES THAT WE REVIEWED. OF THE THIRTY INVESTIGATIONS ARE TEAM ASSESSED CJ P. INVESTIGATORS DID NOT TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OR THE EXTENT. OF ALLEGED MISCONDUCT IN ELEVEN CASES. THE EXAMPLE SHOW THE ALLEGATION. INTO THE INADEQUATE INVESTIGATIONS ARE TEAM IDENTIFIED. THEY RANGE FROM MORE MINOR ALLEGATIONS SUCH AS IMPROPERLY DELAYING A CASE. UP TO MORE SEVERE ALLEGATIONS SUCH AS HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A SUBORDINATE OR THREATENING TO ASSAULT LITIGANTS. THE STEP CGP INVESTIGATORS DO NOT TAKE CAN AFFECT THE DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS THAT THE COMMISSION CAN MAKE. UNANSWERED QUESTIONS CAN HAVE A DIRECT. NEGATIVE AFFECT ON THE COMMISSION'S ABILITY TO ISSUE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE. IF YOU PLEASE TURN TO PAGE THREE THERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF MISSTEPS FOR CASE THAT OUR TEAM REVIEWED. IN THIS CASE A LITIGANT ALLEGE TO THE JUDGE AND A MEMBER OF THE COURT STAFF DID NOT LET HIS FRIENDS ACCOMPANY HIM INTO THE COURT ROOM. BY LAW THIS PROCEEDING MUST BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. CJ P. INVESTIGATORS INTERVIEWED THE COMPLAIN INTERVIEWED ONE OF THE FRIENDS AND TRIED TO INTERVIEW THE SECOND FRIEND. INVESTIGATORS ALSO REQUESTING COMMENT FROM THE JUDGE. HOWEVER CDP INVESTIGATORS DID NOT INTERVIEW THE COURTS STAFF. WHO ALLEGEDLY BARRED ENTRY? DID NOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVENT WAS CAPTURED ON SECURITY CAMERAS. AND DID NOT OBSERVE THE JUDGE AND SIMILAR PROCEEDINGS. HE DID CONDUCT COURTROOM OBSERVATION. BUT ONE IT ALREADY INFORMED THE JUDGE IT WAS CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. INTO AND OBSERVED A DIFFERENT KIND OF CASE. WE THEREFORE DETERMINED THAT THIS WAS A QUESTIONABLE INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH. OUR TEAM DETERMINE THAT CJ PEAS INVESTIGATIVE SHORTCOMINGS ARE DUE TO A LACK OF KEY SAFEGUARDS THAT WOULD ENSURE QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS. CJ P. SIX INVESTIGATORS REPORT DIRECTLY TO THE DIRECTOR CHIEF COUNSEL. WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE ORGANIZATION IS NOT DEEPLY INVOLVED IN EVERY CASE? AND IS THEREFORE NOT LIKELY TO CATCH GAPS IN INVESTIGATIVE APPROACHES IN A TIMELY MANNER. AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION BEST PRACTICES ALSO RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE COMMENCING INVESTIGATIONS INVESTIGATORS TO PREPARE A STRATEGY FOR EACH CASE. CJ PEAS INTERNAL MANUAL ALSO ECHOES THESE BEST PRACTICES. YES YOU J. P. INVESTIGATORS CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY PREPARED STRATEGIES FOR ANY. OF THE THIRTY CASES THAT WE REVIEW IN. PRIOR TO THIS AUDIT THERE HAD BEEN NO INDEPENDENT REVIEW. OF CJ PEAS INVESTIGATIONS SINCE ITS INCEPTION FIFTY NINE YEARS AGO. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAKE A ONE TIME APPROPRIATE. TO SEE JP CAN HIRE A LIMITED TERM INVESTIGATIONS MANAGER. OUR OFFICE ALSO RECOMMENDS AS HE J. P. DEFINE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT POSITION. AND RETURN TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH A MORE PRECISE REQUEST. AFTER DETERMINES FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT POSITION NEEDS TO BE FULL TIME. FINALLY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT CJ P. REQUIRE INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOWING DEVELOP STRATEGIES. AND THAT THE INDEPENDENT LEGAL ADVISER PERFORM QUALITY REVIEWS OF COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FOUR YOU'LL SEE OUR OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINDING RELATED TO CJ PEAS INVESTIGATIONS. OUR TEAM FOUND THAT CDP FAILED TO DETECT WARNING SIGNS OF ON GOING STE STE ONGOING MISCONDUCT. THE GRAPHIC SHOWS THE COMPLAIN HISTORY FOR ONE JUDGE FOR SIMILAR AND SERIOUS ON THE BENCH MISCONDUCT. THIS JUDGE RECEIVED EIGHT COMPLAINTS OVER A FIVE YEAR HISTORY. FOR THIS TYPE OF MISCONDUCT ALONE. COMPLAIN TO FROM YOUR ONE BECAUSE OUR TEAM CONCERNED. CJ P. OPENED AN INVESTIGATION. THE JUDGE ADMITTED FAULTS AND PROMISED NOT TO ALLOW THE CONDUCT TO RECUR. THE COMMISSION CLOSE THE CASE WITHOUT. CJ P. RECEIVE FOR ADDITIONAL COMPLAINTS IN YEARS. TWO THREE AND FOUR THAT IT DID NOT INVESTIGATE AND IT DID NOT TAKE ACTION ON FOR COMPLAINTS SEVEN IN YOUR FOR C. J. P. FINALLY OPENED A SECOND INVESTIGATION. HOWEVER IT IS COMPLAIN A THAT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. THIS COMPLAINING ATTACHED TRANSCRIPTS THAT WERE INSTRUMENTAL IMPROVING THE MISCONDUCT OCCURRED. DO THE EVIDENCE THE COMPLAINANT PROVIDED CJ P. DID NOT HAVE TO PERFORM AN EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION INTO THIS COMPLAINT. FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION OF THESE COMPLAINTS THE JUDGE AGREED ON A CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT. TO RESIGN AND NEVER SEE JUDICIAL OFFICE AGAIN. THE FINAL INVESTIGATION. ENDED WITH THE JUDGE LEAVING THE BENCH. BUT THE FACT THAT SEE JP DID NOT DETECT A PATTERN OF INAPPROPRIATE ACTIVITY. IN YEARS TWO THREE OR FOUR RAISES SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER HOW IT APPROACHES ITS OVERSIGHT OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. THE FACTS SHOW THAT CJ PETERS NOT TAKE STEPS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF COMPLAINTS AND INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINANTS ALLEGE SIMILAR PROBLEMS. AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION CDP'S OUTDATED AND AT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WILL HINDER ITS ABILITY. TO DETERMINE IF A PATTERN OF ALLEGATIONS EXIST. THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFICIENCY. WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE RIGHT LEGISLATURE MAKE A ONE TIME APPROPRIATIONS SOCI JP CAN UPDATE ITS CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. AND OUR FIGURES ARE BASED ON EXTENSIVE RESEARCH OF OFF THE SHELF PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE IN MEET CJ PEAS NEEDS WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS. WHETHER OR NOT IT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET CGP SHOULD BEGIN WORKING TO FIND ANY POSSIBLE AVENUES TO IDENTIFY FUNDING SO WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT CJ P. DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT PROCEDURES. THAT REQUIRE ATTORNEYS TO LOOK FOR PATTERNS AND OPEN OR EXPAND INVESTIGATIONS WHEN WARRANTED. THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT AN INDEPENDENT FAIR AND COMPETENT JUDICIARY WILL INTERPRET AND APPLY THE LAW. CJ PEAS ROLE AS THE SOLE AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR INVESTIGATING ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE ETHICS CODE. IS ESSENTIAL TO UPHOLDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIARY AND PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN CALIFORNIA'S JUDICIAL SYSTEM. WHEN IT DOES NOT CONDUCT ADEQUATE INVESTIGATIONS CJ P. FALL SHORT OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL CHARGE? IF YOU PLEASE TURN TO PAGE FIVE THIS OUTLINES. IN THE SECOND CHAPTER OF OUR REPORT REGARDING CONCERNS WITH CJ P. STRUCTURE. OUR TEAM FOUND AS HE DEBUTS UNITARY STRUCTURE DOES NOT ALIGN WITH BEST PRACTICES FROM THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION. THAT AIM TO ADDRESS THE PERCEIVED UNFAIRNESS OF A SYSTEM THAT COMBINES INVESTIGATION PROSECUTION HEARING AND DECISION MAKING INTO A SINGLE PROCESS. AS THE TOP PART OF THE GRAPHIC SHOWS THE UNITARY STRUCTURE ALLOWS COMMISSIONERS WHO MAKE DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS. TO BE EXPOSED TO INFORMATION ABOUT ALLEGED MISCONDUCT THAT SHOULD NOT FACTOR INTO THEIR FINAL DECISIONS. THEREFORE THERE IS HEIGHTENED RISK AND AN OVERALL PERCEPTION THAT COMMISSIONERS MAY INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY. USE UNPROVEN INFORMATION TO REACH CONCLUSIONS ABOUT APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINE. THE STRUCTURE RECOMMENDED BY BEST PRACTICES DIVIDES THE COMMISSION INTO TWO BODIES AND INVESTIGATIVE BODY AND A DISCIPLINARY BODY. THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY WOULD ASSESS EVIDENCE AND FORWARD PROVEN ALLEGATIONS TO THE DISCIPLINARY BODY. UNDER THIS COMPOSITION NO MEMBER OF THE COMMISSION IS INVOLVED IN BOTH DECIDING WHETHER TO FILE FORM FORMAL CHARGES. AND IN HEARING THE CASE RESULTING FROM THOSE CHARGES. AS A STATE AUDITOR MENTION SEVENTEEN OTHER STATES. KNOWING HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED THESE BEST PRACTICES. PLEASE TURN TO PAGE SIX FOR ANOTHER CONCERN OUR OFFICE HAS RECEIVED A PIECE CURRENT STRUCTURE. CGP CURRENTLY RELIES ON A PANEL OF THREE JUDGES CALLED SPECIAL MASTERS. TO HEAR CASES DURING FORMAL PROCEEDINGS WHICH INVOLVE A PUBLIC TRIAL AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING. OUR REVIEW FOUND THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS TEND TO BE MORE LENIENT WHEN JUDGING THEIR PEERS. CJ PEAS RELIANCE ON JUDGES TO HEAR CASES INVOLVING THEIR PEERS ALSO FALL SHORT OF THE INTENT. OF PROPOSITION ONE NINETY PASSED BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION ONE NINETY ARGUED THAT IT WOULD ENSURE PUBLIC CONTROL OF JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE. I WOULD ELIMINATE JUDICIAL DOMINATION OF C. JP IN FAVOR OF THE PUBLIC MAJORITY. SINCE THE VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION. ONE NINETY C. J. P. HAS NEVER HEARD ITS OWN CASES. THIS LEAVES JUDGES WITH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE OVER JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE. WHICH MAY IMPACT THE CONTROL THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS WANTED TO PLACE IN THE HANDS OF THE PUBLIC. LASTLY THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE EXPRESS AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE JUDGES ENGAGING CORRECTIVE ACTION. ALLOWING THE COMMISSION TO ISSUE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WOULD STRENGTHEN CJ PEAS ABILITY TO PREVENT YOU DISH -- MISCONDUCT FROM REOCCURRING. PAGE SEVEN OUTLINES THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THIS CHAPTER. CJ PIECE FOUNDATIONAL CRITERIA RESTS IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. THEREFORE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WILL REQUIRE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. THE LEGISLATURE REFERRED AND THE CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED THE LAST MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR OUR REVIEW THE FIRST OF ITS KIND AND CONDUCTED TWENTY FIVE YEARS SINCE THAT AMENDMENT. FOUND THAT CDP STRUCTURE AND PROCESS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT REFORMS FOR CJ PITA MENE ITS MISSION. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT CALIFORNIA ADOPT A COMMISSION STRUCTURE. THAT WOULD BE BOTH FAIR TO JUDGES AND INCREASE THE PUBLIC'S INVOLVEMENT. THIS STRUCTURE WOULD ESTABLISH A TWO BODY COMMISSION WITH THE PUBLIC MAJORITY IN BOTH THE INVESTIGATIVE AND DISCIPLINARY BODIES. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE DISCIPLINARY BODY TO HEAR ITS OWN CASES ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR THE SPECIAL MASTERS. FINALLY IT WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE THE COMMISSION TO USE CORRECT. OUR OFFICE RECOMMENDS RECOGNIZES THAT THESE CHANGES ARE OF SUBSTANTIAL. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE CJ P. IS POSITION TO EFFECTIVELY PROTECT. BOTH THE JUDGES RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT WE SUMMARIZE OUR LAST FINDING. WHICH CONCLUDES THAT CJ P. SHOULD INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WE FOUND CJ P. HAS NOT PURSUE CHANGES TO ITS OPERATIONS THAT WILL BOLSTER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCESSIBILITY DESPITE THIRTY YEARS OF PUBLIC DISTRUST. CGP DOES NOT CONDUCT PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS HOLD PUBLIC MEETINGS OR ACCEPT ELECTRONIC COMPLAINTS. MOREOVER CGP DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE GUIDANCE TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT HOW TO SUBMIT A COMPLAINT THAT WOULD INCLUDE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION. THAT WOULD IMPROVE ITS ODDS OF MOVING FORWARD TO AN INVESTIGATION. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT CGP IMPROVE ITS EFFORTS IN ALL OF THESE AREAS. CJ P. ALSO DEPENDS ON THE COURTS COOPERATION IF IT WANTS TO PUBLICIZE ITS EXISTENCE IN COURTHOUSES. AB NEEDS TO ADVERTISE THAT INVESTIGATES COMPLAINTS OF JUDICIALMISCONDUCT AND COURTHOUSES ACROSS CAL. COUNTIES. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE RECOMMENDS THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE ALL COURTHOUSES PUBLICLY DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT SEE JP AND PROMINENT LOCATIONS. CJ BE IS AGREED TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE MAIN. IN C. JB'S RESPONSE IT ALSO STATED THAT IT BELIEVES ITS UNITARY STRUCTURE COMPORTS WITH DUEPROCESS. AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. WE DISAGREE WITH CJ PIECE PERSPECTIVE. ALTHOUGH THE SUPREME COURT HAS ISSUE DECISIONS CONCLUDING THAT CJ PEAS INVESTIGATIVE ENERGY TO CONSORTIUM SURE. DOES NOT VIOLATE JUDGES DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. THESE COURT DECISIONS ARE DECADES OLD AND RELY IN PART ON OBSERVATIONS ABOUT CJ P. STRUCTURE THAT HAVE SINCE CHANGED. WHEN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT MADE THESE DECISIONS IT WAS ALSO THE FINAL DECISION MAKER FOR THE MOST SEVERE FORMS OF DISCIPLINE SUCH AS REMOVAL? TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO IN. NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PROP ONE NINETY GAVE CJ P. ALL DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY. SINCE PROP ONE NINETY MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO SEE J. P. STRUCTURE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS NOT RULED ON WHETHER CJ PEAS CURRENT UNITARY STRUCTURE CREATES DUE PROCESS CONCERNS FOR JUDGES. REVIEW INDICATES THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE NECESSARY TO IMPROVE CJ PEACE PROCESS SEES FOR INVEST INVESTIGATING AND DISAPPOINTING JUDGES. WE BELIEVE CJ PEOPLE NEED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE COMING YEARS TO ADDRESS THESE DEFICIENCIES. THANK YOU AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. HI THANK YOU -- WHAT THAT LOOKS GOOD? BUT HE'S HE'S MISTER HARRIS IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITHOUT WILLIS JUMP STRAIGHT INTO QUESTIONS I KNOW WE ARE TO HAVE -- SOME QUESTIONS BY SENATOR JOHN.

CREATED MY GRAPHIC ARTISTS IN THE OFFICE SO I THINK IT'S VERY WELL DONE SO. FOR THAT AND IT JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. YOU KNOW I THINK YOUR PRESENTATION IS VERY BALANCED -- YOU KNOW YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS I BELIEVE YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSPECTIVE VERY FAIR -- TO THE JUDGES -- BUT AS YOU RIGHTLY POINTED OUT WE NEED TO TUNE A LOT OF THIS UP SO -- THANKS FOR STAYING IN THERE THANKS FOR BEING IN A DELIBERATE ON THIS AND I'M I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN INITIATE. ALL OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS WITH WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION STUFF THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATORLET ME -- OR GO TO ASK A QUESTION REAL QUICK BECAUSE WHAT YOU FOCUSED A LOT ON THE BICAMERAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION AND AND THE RESPONSE LETTER TO SEEM TO BE -- ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WAS. I GUESS THEY WERE OPPOSED. TO AND SO I WANTED TO JUST CAN GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT AND AND WHY YOU THINK. THEY'RE SO OPPOSED TO THIS WHEN WE DO IT WITH I BELIEVE. MISS HOW IT TALKED ABOUT THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION OR HOW WE DO THIS WITH LAWYERS. AND SO CAN YOU JUST GIVE US A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT ON WISER THAT TUG OF WAR WHITE WHY IS THIS POINT OF CONFLICT IN A WE'D HAVE. TO SEE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO DO THAT FROM JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE WHY THAT IS A WHAT. QUESTION WHEN THEY GET UP HERE. AS WELL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S BOB PARIS AS STATE AUDITOR INDICATED BEFORE I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER ON THE SIDE -- I THINK THE MAIN. CONTENTION FROM THE C. J. P. AS TO WHY A UNITARY STRUCTURE IS NOT A PROBLEM HAS BANNED THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS THAT HAVE. BASICALLY SPOKEN EXACTLY THAT BEFORE -- THERE HAVE BEEN SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS BY THE SUPREME COURT IN YEARS PRIOR ABOUT WHETHER THE UNITARY STRUCTURE IS IN FACT PROBLEMATIC -- HOWEVER IS MISS CUTTING AS INDICATED BEFORE IT WE OBSERVE THAT THIS DECISION DECISIONS ARE DECADES OLD AND AND PROBABLY EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY. THERE'S BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THE C. JP'S AUTHORITY SINCE THE SUPREME COURT DECISIONS WERE MADE -- CERTAINLY THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW SUPREME COURT DECISIONS -- SINCE PROP ONE NINETY PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR BUT NONE OF THOSE HAVE SPECIFICALLY SPOKEN TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU THE UNITARY STRUCTURE IS PROBLEMATIC FOR A JUDGE -- AGAIN IN IT HERE IT'S TO THE BEST PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS FOR THE CONCERNS THAT COULD PRESENT THEMSELVES WHEN A JUDGE IS -- ESSENTIALLY FACING -- CHALLENGING THE COMMISSION -- THAT WAS BOTH THE INVESTIGATE. THIS FINAL DECISION MAKER AS TO WHETHER DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE ISSUED WE MADE OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY BE SPLIT INTO A BY CAMEL STRUCTURE. MY NAME MY NAME IS HEATHER KENDRICK I WAS THE ATTORNEY WHO ASSISTED THE AUDIT TEAM. THE AS A POINT OF DISTINCTION THESE DECISIONS THAT CAME OUT PRIOR -- TO NINETEEN PRIOR TO PROPOSITION ONE NINETY COMING INTO AFFECT THOSE STRUCTURE AT THE TIME WAS THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WOULD ACT AS THE PROSECUTOR PROSECUTORIAL FUNCTION. AND THEN THE SUPREME COURT WOULD BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKER ON ALL THE RELIEF SEVERE FORMS OF DISCIPLINE. AND THEN THE CJ P. WAS MORE WORKING IN IN THE EVIDENTIARY CAPACITY IN DOING MINDING SING CONCLUSIONS AND SO THERE IS REALLY KIND OF A SPLIT. OF HOW. A A PROCESS OF HOW IT JUDGES CASE WOULD GO THROUGH THERE WAS A SEPARATION BETWEEN THE THE PROSECUTOR THE DECISION MAKER THE EVIDENCE FACT FINDER AND SO. ONCE PROP ONE NINETY CAME INTO EFFECT ALL OF THOSE FUNCTIONS CAME INTO THE ONE UNITARY STRUCTURE CGP [inaudible] THANK YOU. ON THAT POINT. ASSEMBLY. LINE ON THAT POINT PLEASE ENTER A CASKET. YOU HAVE A DE FACTO BICAMERAL SYSTEM IF YOU SIMPLY SEGREGATED THE INVESTIGATIVE FUNCTION FROM THE EDGY KATORI FUNCTION YOU WON'T NEED TO HE JUST SAY IF YOU'RE DOING INVESTIGATION. FOR YEAR ONE THAT YOU'RE ON THE YOU'RE ON THE COMMISSION THEN YOUR TO YOU DO YOU DO THE DECISIONS AND YOU SPLIT IT SPLIT IT UP AND THEN. YOU IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE DONE INVESTIGATION NOW IT'S UP TO THE THE PANEL THAT YOU JUST -- DON'T PARTICIPATE WOULDN'T THAT EFFECTIVELY GET AT THE ROOT THIS IS THE SEPARATION THAT YOU'RE ASKING. FOR IT IT WOULD EFFECTIVELY DO THAT HOWEVER THAT IS NOT WHAT OUR CONSTITUTION ALLOWS FOR CURRENTLY THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT THE COMMISSION CJ P. AS THE COMMISSIONERS AS A BODY. TO BE INVOLVED IN ALL OF THE PROCESS. FROM SO BUT THEY MAKE IT. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT EVERY COMMISSIONER HAS SERVICE I READ IT YOU SEE EVERY COMMISSIONER HAS. TO DO EVERY INVESTIGATION. THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER IN THE INVESTIGATION GOES FORWARD. THEY MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT BUT FORMA DISCIPLINE SHOULD HAPPEN THEY HEAR THE THE JUDGES WHEN THE JUDGES COME FORWARD AND SAY YOU KNOW I I DISAGREE OR I WANT TO PRESENT SOME EVIDENCE. SO THEY'RE INVOLVED IN ALL THE STAGES OF THE PROCESS. WE ALSO TO TALK TALK TO CJ P. ABOUT SOME OF THOSE POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES AND THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT THEY EXPRESSED WAS LOGISTICS. IN TERMS OF FIGURING OUT HOW TO BEST MANAGER SYSTEM LIKE THAT SOME OF THESE CASES CAN GO ON FOR MULTIPLE YEARS. AND SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MANAGE HAVING COMMISSIONERS BE INVOLVED IN ONE PART OF THE PROCESS THOSE COMMISSIONERS MIGHT TERM OUT. AND THEN -- WOULDN'T BE AVAILABLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THEM THE REST OF THE PROCESS AND SO -- IT WAS LOGISTICAL REASONS THAT ALTERNATELY LET US TO ACCEPTING BEST PRACTICES AND RECOMMENDING A BICAMERAL STRUCTURE. I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF THE SUPERVISOR WHY WOULD YOU NEED SUPERVISOR IF FOR ALL COULD BE HAPPY DOING ALL THE INVESTIGATION TO MAKE ALL DECISIONS. WHEN I I THOUGHT I UNDERSTOOD THE ROLE THE SUPERVISOR -- IF YOU IF YOU HAVE THE JUDGES TO IN THAT THE EVIDENTIARY. EVIDENTIAL. THREE PORTION OF IT AND THEN YOU HAVE [inaudible] THE COMMISSION. ADJUDICATING NOW YOU'RE SAYING I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT NO THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE TO BE INVOLVED FROM DAY. ONE AND THEY HAVE TO BE IN THE COURTHOUSE WATCHING OBSERVING THE JUDGES. WHAT BENEFIT IS THAT SAID SO TO CLARIFY? THE COMMISSION IS INVOLVEDAT THE KEY DECISION POINTS IN A CASE SO THE A COMPLAINT IS RECEIVED BY THE COMMISSION IT'S REVIEWED INITIALLY BY ITS INTAKE STAFF WHO REACH A PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION ABOUT WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION OR NOT. THAT'S THE FIRST DECISION POINT AT WHICH THE COMMISSION IS INVOLVED AND AND MAKES A DECISION AS A BODY -- BUT NO THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT ACTING AS THE INVESTIGATOR IN SO FAR AS THEIR OUT AT THE COURTHOUSE IS DOING THE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND WORK THEMSELVES THEY HAVE IT A STAFF OF INVESTIGATORS TO DO THAT FOR THEM. THE PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATIVE SUPERVISOR POSITION IS TO ENSURE THAT THE WORK DONE BY THOSE SIX INVESTIGATORS AS OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AS TIME IT'S CRAZINESS MENTIONED. WE FOUND PROBLEMS WITH THE THOROUGHNESS OF THE INVESTING SOME OF THE INVESTIGATIONS WE REVIEWED ABOUT A THIRD OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WE FELT LIKE WERE NOT THOROUGHLY CONDUCTED. THAT'S WHAT THE INVESTIGATIVE SUPERVISOR WOULD INSURE SO THAT. WHEN THE INVESTIGATORS COME BACK TO THE COMMISSION AND PRESENT THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EITHER CLOSING THE INVESTIGATION WITH NO FURTHER ACTION OR -- ISSUING DISCIPLINE THAT THE COMMISSION CAN HAVE ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND MAKE A FULLY INFORMED DECISION. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT MAYBE. MIKE HOUSE KEYS EXAMPLE. FOR EXAMPLE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP EARLIER ABOUT THE ON PAGE. FOUR WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT. I GUESS NUMBER EIGHT FOR YOUR FIVE FOR THE JUDGE CENTER THERE'S BEEN SOME MEDIA ATTENTION ON THIS AS WELL -- THOSE SERIOUS WITH THE COLORS YEARS BREACH OF MISCONDUCT. AND THE TEAM DIDN'T. CJ P. A THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT IS BASICALLY DRAG THEIR FEET. IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING -- AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING BUT THE JUDGE STILL -- ABDICATED HIS ROLE SO IN. A BICAMERAL SYSTEM HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY WORK AS OPPOSED. TO THE UNITARY -- THE UNITARY AT CAROL SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE NOW. MAYBE OUR PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AND RIGHT SO WE CAN WE CAN UE THE INFORMATION ON PAGE FOR THIS STEP THROUGH HOW IT WOULD WORK IN A BY CAMEL SITUATION SO -- IN THE BY CAMEL STRUCTURE THAT WERE SUGGESTING THE WORK THAT IS DONE BEFORE THE DECISION WHETHER DISCIPLINE SHOULD BE ISSUED OR NOT WHAT ALL HAPPENED ON THE INVESTIGATIVE SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO IN LOOKING AT PAGE. FOUR COMPLAINTS ONE THROUGH. WELL REALLY WANT ONE THROUGH EIGHT ALL OF THE INVESTIGATIVE WORK. BY THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY THEY WOULD HAVE A STAFF. PROBABLY THE SAME STAFF THAT THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY HAS. THAT WOULD DO THE INVESTIGATIVE GROUNDWORK. HOWEVER IF THOSE INVESTIGATORS FELT LIKE DISCIPLINE WAS MERITED OTHER WORDS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CLEARLY AND CONVINCINGLY PROOF THAT THE JUDGE HAD ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT. THEY WOULD THEN MAKE A REFERRAL TO THE DISCIPLINARY BODY WHO WOULD THEN OPINE ON ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE IS MERITED HERE GIVEN THE PROVEN MISCONDUCT. SO. IN THE SITUATION OF COMPLAINTS SEVEN AND EIGHT WERE AN INVESTIGATION IS OPENED THAT WOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION OPEN BY THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY. NGUYEN COMPLAINANT EIGHT SUBMITTED THE TRANSCRIPTS THAT MUST CRAZINESS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER THAT WERE ENDED ENDED UP BEING THE CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT. I AM IS THAT SIMPLY THERE'S A COURT TRANSCRIPT THAT PROVED THE JUDGE AND ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT. THEN THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY WOULD REFER THAT TO THE DISCIPLINARY SIDE OF THE HOUSE. THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY ACCESS TO THE PROVEN ALLEGATIONS SO FOR INSTANCE IF COMPLAINING EIGHT ALLEGED SEVERAL OTHER INSTANCES OF MISCONDUCT THAT WERE NOT PROVEN THE DISCIPLINARY BODY WOULD NOT BE PRIVY TO THAT INFORMATION. THEY WOULD ONLY KNOW WHAT THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATIVE BODY HAD. LAIN CAM INTEGRATE SUBSTANTIATED. AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE A DISCIPLINARY DECISION. SERVICE SAY THE INVESTIGATIVE BODY THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE TAINTED BECAUSE ACTUALLY REVIEWING ALL OF THE FACTS OF THE SOME OF THOSE THINGS WERE JUST BEST FOR THE DISCIPLINARY. OKAY WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO SENATOR JACKSON THEN SENATOR MINING THAN SENATOR COPY AT ALL. SO CENTER JACKSON PLEASE AND I'M GONNA HAND OVER THE GAVEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- APPRECIATE THIS -- AGAIN LONG TIME IN COMING -- THE THE PROPOSITION WHICH REFLECTED A PUBLIC THE PUBLIC'S. DESIRE TO BE MORE. HAVE A MORE OPEN AND ROBUST JUDICIARY -- I THINK WAS VERY IMPORTANT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR POINTING OUT. THE INHERENT UNFAIRNESS OF THE UNICAMERAL SYSTEM. WE HAVE BEEN IRONICALLY TOLD BY -- THE COURTS THAT -- IN SITUATIONS UNDER A PROP. TITLE NINE WHEN WE'VE HAD -- UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES HAVE A UNICAMERAL TYPE PROCESS THAT THE INVESTIGATOR WAS ALSO THE THE DAY THE FACT FINDER AND THE DISCIPLINARY -- THAT THAT WAS A VIOLATION TO PROCESS. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A VERY SIMILAR THE ANALOGY I THINK IS QUITE SIMILAR HERE AND AS WAS POINTED OUT. WHEN YOU'RE A RECIPIENT OF UNCONFIRMED AN UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS TO BE ALSO THE ONE HEARING THE ACTUAL PROCEEDING AND THEN MAKING A DISCIPLINARY DECISION REALLY DOES VIOLATE TO PROCESS SO? I I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. THAT THAT IS PART OF YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT THAT THAT IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE JUDGES -- IN THE PROCESS. WHAT WHAT CONCERNS ME IS A COUPLE THINGS THAT I ALLUDED TO OUR IN MY OPENING REMARKS? WHAT IS MISCONDUCT? I'D I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE REALLY HAVE TO BORE DOWN ON BECAUSE FREQUENTLY WHAT WE SEE IS WE SEE LITIGANTS WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE DECISION. THAT COMES DOWN FROM THE COURT. AND WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SORT OF SEPARATE THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A PROCESS NOW TO CALL THE APPELLATE PROCESS WHERE IF YOU'RE DISSATISFIED WITH THE DECISION IT'S REACHED YOU CAN REACH YOU CAN APPEAL. AND THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO SEE. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT WE WE BY VERY THE VERY NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT. THE BEHAVIOR. COURT MORE THAN THE DECISION OF THE COURT. AND AND SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU -- IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS HERE AND ANALYSES OF THE THE FUNCTIONING OF THIS SHE JP TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT REALLY IS THE ISSUE HERE -- AND THAT IS WHETHER JUDGES ARE RUDE TO LITIGANTS -- WHETHER THEY ARE BEHAVING IN AN INAPPROPRIATE WAY AS A AS A JUDGE OR AS A HUMAN BEING WE'VE HEARD SOME HORRIFIC STORIES ABOUT THINGS THAT HAVE GONE ON AGAIN BY SMALL HOPEFULLY SMALL MINORITY OF JUDGES BUT FOR WHICH ACTION CLEARLY. IS APPROPRIATE. SO WE HAVE BEHAVIOR WE HAVE TEMPERAMENT -- I HAVE BEEN YELLED AT BY JUDGES AND NOT BEEN VERY HAPPY AT IT AND COURSE YOU CAN'T YELL BACK IF YOU HAVE ANY OUNCE OF COMMON SENSE -- AND THESE CAN BE PATTERNS THAT THAT COME FORWARD A LOT OF THIS THOUGH IT SEEMS TO ME CAN BE RESOLVED THROUGH. THE EDUCATION PROCESS. AND YOU INDICATED WHICH I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT THE COURT AT THAT THE C. JP DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO REQUIRE THAT I THINK MOST JUDGES WANT TO DO A GOOD JOB I THINK -- I RECALL. I KNEW WHO SUFFERED -- US OF YOUR BLOOD SUGAR PROBLEMS SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE IN COURT A QUARTERTO TWELVE WITH THE JUDGE. YOU WERE LIKELY. TO IT HAVE SOME KIND OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR BECAUSE HIS BLOOD SUGAR WAS TOO LOW -- SIMPLE THINGS LIKE THAT THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED I THINK APPROPRIATELY THROUGH EDUCATION. BUT I'M I'M CURIOUS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE INITIAL DECISION MAKER WHO IS THE INTAKE PERSON. IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN THE INTAKE PERSON COMES IN AND AND DECIDES -- WHETHER OR NOT TO GO FORWARD. DID YOU EXAMINE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THE INTAKE PERSON IS TRAINED TO LOOK FOR SO THAT WE CAN -- DIFFERENTIATE YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVE HERE -- THE STATEMENT THAT -- THE COMMISSION HAS WEAKNESSES IN ITS OVERSIGHT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO PERSIST THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE IS A LOT OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. I THINK TO THE PUBLIC SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS BE MORE CLEAR AND HOW WE DEFINE WHAT IS JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT OR WHAT IS JUST DECISION MAKING THAT LITIGANTS. DON'T LIKE CAN CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT [inaudible] YEAH. SO. TO YOUR POINT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS A VIOLATION OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS AND ONE OF THE CORE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INTAKE ATTORNEYS AT C. JP. IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A COMPLAINANT HAS ACTUALLY ALLEGE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS I THINK IT'S OVER 90% OF THE COMPLAINTS YOU J. P. RECEIVES ARE ACTUALLY CLOSED IT INTAKE. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE SAW FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THE COMPLAINANT IS NOT ALLEGING JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT THEY'RE ALLEGING -- CONCERNED WITH THE OUTCOME OF THEIR CASE IT'S CALLED LEGAL ERROR AND SO WE DID LOOK INTO THOSE TYPES OF CASES AND WE HAVE SOME. RECOMMENDATIONS TO SEE JP ABOUT TRACKING JUDGES WHO HAVE CONSISTENTLY RECEIVED COMPLAINTS ABOUT LEGAL AIR BUT YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT MANY OF THE COMPLAINTS YOU J. P. RECEIVES ARE NOT ABOUT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. NINETY PERCENTS PRETTY HIGH NUMBER NOT JUST MANY SO I THINK THE PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO IS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC. OUR END IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THINGS ONLINE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. THAT WE IDENTIFY CHEST WHAT THE C. JP'S ROLE IS AND IF THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A DECISION THAT THEY SHOULD SEEK COUNSEL LORD THAT THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES AVAILABLE. FOR THEM TO PURSUE. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DEFINING ELEMENT AS WELL IS IT NOT ABSOLUTELY CENTER JACKSON THAT'S WHY WE SKEWS ME HAD THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB OF CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. SO THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AND BEING DISAPPOINTED IN THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CASE -- AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT SOME OF THE A LOT OF THE CASES THAT WERE CLOSE THE MEN MAJORITY THE CASES THAT WERE CLOSED WERE FILED BY THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THEY WORK. SUBMITTING INFORMATION THAT WAS RELEVANT TO THE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT OR VIOLATION OF THE CODE YOU JUDICIAL ETHICS -- SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE NEEDS TO BE GUIDANCE OUT THERE FOR THE PUBLIC TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN BETWEEN. NOT BEING HAPPY WITH THE OUTCOME OF YOUR CASE AND WHAT REALLY IS -- JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT MY LAST QUESTION AND I DID. OKAY PLEASE SENATOR RICK CASKEY. ON THE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT YOU HAVE A SECTION. TALK ABOUT THE INITIAL TAKE SEEMS TO BE REASONABLE DID YOU GET INTO A DISCUSSION ON LEGAL AIR. ONE SEVEN ORALLY. I MANAGING THE COMPLAINT IS THE INITIAL CASTLE BC BOB. IT. WILL BE ALRIGHT JUDICIAL ERROR IT'S NOT A CONTACT US TODAY RIGHT -- IS THE PEOPLE OF OUR TIMES. THE MOBILE CHURN THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT THE TWENTY FIRST. IT DOESN'T. WANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT. PROBLEM ONE NINETY AND HAVING. NON LAWYERS IN THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LOOK AT THIS. AIR AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE RULES THAT THE CHURCH IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO AT LEAST. YOU INDICATE THAT THE PROBLEM ONE OF THE REQUIRES MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO BE HERE LOOKING AT THE YEARS OF LEGAL LEGAL AIR. HOW OTHER GOOD GREASY ONE NINETY HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE? WE HAVE. PEOPLE LOOKING AT WHETHER OR YOU WILL HAVE TO SAY I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT. A COUPLE OF OBSERVATIONS I THINK IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION SO ONE WOULD BE THAT THE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD COMPRISE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSION -- DO CURRENTLY COMPRISE THE MAJORITY THE COMMISSION THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT WITHOUT -- JUDGE MEMBERS AN ATTORNEY MEMBERS SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE THE IT'S A DELIBERATE OF PROCESS THEY ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION AND AND HOPEFULLY THAT DISCUSSIONS EDUCATIONAL TO THE COMMISSION MEMBERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE -- SPECIFIC TRAINING OR BACKGROUND. A SECOND THING THAT WOULD BE THAT THE TYPE OF DECISIONS THAT THE COMMISSION MAKES ARE NOT DECISIONS. WHETHER TO OVERTURN A JUDICIAL DECISION OR NOT THAT'S THE APPELLATE COURT'S ROLE ONLY AN APPELLATE COURT CAN CHANGE THE ACTUAL DECISION MADE BY THE JUDGE IN A PARTICULAR CASE. WITH THE COMMISSION IS CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT WE NEED THE COMMISSION TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHETHER A JUDGE HAS ENGAGED IN SUCH A PERVASIVE PATTERN OF MAKING A LEGAL ERROR. OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S THE DATA THAT WE WANT THEM COLLECTING IN REVIEWING. HAS THIS JUDGE DEMONSTRATED OVER OF A CONSISTENT PERVASIVE PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE JUDGE. MAY BE ENGAGING IN LEGAL AIR THAT INDICATES SOME OTHER FACTOR INVOLVED BIASES ONE OF THEM IT COULD ALSO BE -- INCOMPETENT SOMETHING THAT INDICATES THAT THIS GOES BEYOND UST -- AN ERROR CONDUCTED WITH THE FULL INTEGRITY AND INTEND TO DO WELL AT IN THEIR ROLE AS IT AS A JUDGE -- THE CAP WILL NEED TO SET YOU KNOW STANDARDS FOR HOW IT'S GOING TO TRY AND ESTABLISH IN A WIN IF WE CROSS THAT THRESHOLD WHEN WE CROSSED THE THRESHOLD -- TO AT LEAST OPEN AN INVESTIGATION AND ASK FURTHER QUESTIONS OR WHEN IS THIS JUST -- ISOLATED INSTANCES OF LEGAL AIR COMMITTED IN GOOD FAITH. WELL BUT PART OF THE PROBLEM THERE IS WHO DECIDES WHAT'S LEGAL ERROR. USUALLY LEGAL THERE IS DECIDED BY THE APPELLATE COURT. SO AND THIS IS A CONCERN IKNOW WHEN THE PUBLIC IT IT GETS INVOLVED IN ALL THE LOS THE LAW -- PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE IT A IT'S THE JAW THE JOB OF A JUDGE TO INTERPRET THE LAW TO APPLY THE LAW. AND WHEN THE JUDGE DOESN'T TO WOULD PROPERLY THAT'S WHEN IT CASES APPEALED AND OVERTURNED ON APPEAL SO. I THINK IT'S A VERY FINE LINE HERE AND I THINK PERHAPS WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON JUST WHAT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS -- BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE CJ PIECE OF ENGAGED IN AND BIAS IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE AND I KNOW THE COURTS A WITH THEY HAVE A SYSTEM OF EDUCATION. WHERE THEY'RE TRYING -- TO IDENTIFY YOU KNOW WE ALL HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS WERE WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN BIASES AND WE TRY TO ADDRESS THAT WE'VE GOT COMMITTEES HERE IN OUR OWN BUILDING. A TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT -- AND PERHAPS THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT THE C. JP COULD BE DOING. THE BILL INTO CAN'T I THINK IS WHICH WHAT FRUSTRATES THE PUBLIC IS THE NOTION THAT WE OF THESE BAD ACTORS WHO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE -- TO TO RULE THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS WITH IMPUNITY. I THINK THAT'S WHAT PROP. NINE ONE NINETY I TRY TO ADDRESS. MY QUESTION THOUGH GOING FORWARD HERE IS. IN THE PROCESS IN THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FREQUENTLY JUDGES ONLY LEARNED THAT AN INVESTIGATION HAS TAKEN PLACE. AFTER IT'S DETERMINED THAT THE COMPLAINT IS JUSTIFIED. AND I AM WONDERING. IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING. ARE IS THERE ANY EFFORT MADE AS YOU SAW TO ACTUALLY INTERVIEW THE JUDGE. AND AND TO ADDRESS THE ALLEGATIONS. TO GET THE COURTS PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE. I I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY SOME JUDGES THEY'VE GOTTEN BLINDSIDED GET IS A LETTER PLEASE APPEAR YOU BEEN ACUSED OF X. Y. AND Z. WE FIND THAT THERE'S OF THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A VALID OR THEIR SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THIS BEHAVIOR. WHAT DO YOU SAY AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT YOU CAN HAVE A PUBLIC HEARINGS WHICH I SUSPECT FOR MANY JUDGES IS NOT AN OPTION BECAUSE? PARTICULARLY IN SMALL COMMUNITIES THAT COULD BE THE END OF THEIR CAREER. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT IT MIGHT IMPACT THEIR ABILITY. TO DISPENSE JUSTICE AS THEY LEGITIMATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY FEEL IS APPROPRIATE SO COULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YES -- SO WE DID SEE CJ P.. CONTACTING JUDGES DURING INVESTIGATIONS NOT NECESSARILY IN AN IN PERSON INTERVIEW BUT THEY WILL SEND LETTERS USUALLY AFTER CONDUCTING SOME INVESTIGATIVE WORK BELIEVE IT WAS TWENTY ONE OF THE THIRTY CASES WE REVIEWED THEY CONTACTED THE JUDGE. AND WHEN THEY CONTACT THE JUDGE THEY'RE LAYING OUT WHAT THE ALLEGATION IS WHAT EVIDENCE THEY'VE COLLECTED TO THAT POINT AND BASICALLY ASKING THE JUDGE FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT ALLEGATION. IF THE JUDGE PROVIDES THEM WITH ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE OR INFIRM. THE COMMISSION CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT CASE AND CLOSE THAT CASE WITHOUT DISCIPLINE AND WE SAW THAT HAPPEN IN SOME OF THE CASES THAT WE REVIEWED -- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING. SB DIDN'T SEE ANY INSTANCES OF JUDGES BEING CALLED. TO APPEAR WITHOUT ANY OPPORTUNITY DATE DO EXACTLY WHAT WAS CRAZINESS ALSO EXPLAINED IN AN I THINK IT'S A THE FINAL THING THAT I WOULD HIGHLIGHT IS THE INSTANCES WHERE WE SAW JUDGES WERE NOT CONTACTED IT'S BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DECIDED THERE WAS NO SUBSTANCE TO THE ALLEGATIONS. SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH DISCIPLINE JUST HAPPENED OUT OF NO WHERE IN THOSE NINE INSTANCES WHERE THE JUDGES NEVER CONTACTED IS ACTUALLY. THERE'S NOT EVEN A POINTS TO CONTACTING TO THE JUDGE HERE THERE'S NOTHING TO TO DISCUSS ANY FURTHER. SENATOR MONNING THANK YOU. THANK YOU A MADAM CHAIR. WELL I WANT TO START BY THANKING -- THE AUDITOR AND YOUR TEAM -- FOR ASSEMBLING WHAT I THINK IS VERY USEFUL. AUDIT AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THAT PROVIDE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE. TO ENGAGE IN ARE BOTH APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND POTENTIALLY ON OUR FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ROLE IN IN SEEKING. TO FIND. TO THE PURSUE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. A QUESTION IN TERMS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IS. NO ABILITY TO FILE AN ELECTRONIC COMPLAINT. IN THE CURRENT COMPLAINT PROCESS IS THERE ANY BASIS FOR AN ATTORNEY OR A COURT ROOM STAFF TO FILE AN ANONYMOUS COMPLAINT OR DO THEY HAVE TO ATTACH THEIR NAME. TO THE COMPLAINT FOR TO BE ACTED UPON. WE SAW INDIVIDUALS WHO SUBMITTED ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS CGP RECOMMENDS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINING ATTACHED THEIR NAME SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP IF IT DOES CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- BUT THERE IS AN OPTION OF FILING ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS. IN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS. FOR AN OFFICER OF THE COURT AN ATTORNEY. TO FILE A COMPLAINT IN AGAINST. A SITTING JUDGE IN THEIR JURISDICTION. IS A FEAR OF RETALIATION. IN A FROM A DUE PROCESS POINT OF VIEW IF A COMPLAINT MOVES FORWARD I CAN SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ACCUSED. HAVING THE ABILITY. TO IF NOT DIRECTLY CROSS EXAMINE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE COMPLAINTS COMING FROM. RESPOND TO IT -- BUT I'VE HEARD FROM. PRACTICING ATTORNEYS WITH PROBLEMS OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. AND I I I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S CONCERN OF MAYBE A GRAY AREA BUT I WOULD THINK IN THE ORIENTATION OF THE INVESTIGATIVE -- PANEL WHETHER IT'S A STAFF INVESTIGATOR WAR WAR COMMISSIONERS. JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS DIFFERENT THAN DISSATISFACTION WITH A LEGAL OPINION -- YOU HAVE YELLING AT LITIGANTS RELATIONSHIP WITH A SUBORDINATE IN THE COURT ROOM. IMPROPERLY BARRING ENTRY TO THE COURTROOM DELEGATING JUDICIAL ROLE TO CLERKS THREATENING TO ASSAULT LITIGANTS. THAT'S JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. THAT THAT DOESN'T TURN ON HOW THEY DECIDED IN THE CASE IN FRONT OF THEM -- SO IF THERE'S ANY. GRAY AREA -- LACK OF UNDERSTANDING IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST HAVE TO READ. JUDICIAL ETHICS REQUIREMENTS. AND HAVE THAT BE PART OF THE ORIENTATION PROCESS BUT BACK TO THE QUESTION OF IF YOU EXPAND EDUCATION. PUBLIC. I WOULD AGREE THAT PART OF THAT HAS TO BE PART OF THAT EDUCATION WHAT DOES CONSTITUTE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. MY GUESS IS THERE ARE A LOT OF INMATES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS WHO BELIEVE. THEY WEREN'T TREATED APPROPRIATELY BASED ON A FINDING OF GUILT IN A SENTENCING TO STATE PRISON. DOESN'T MEAN THERE WAS JUST JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. BUT FOR THESE EXAMPLES. IN IN VOTE INVOLVED IN ELEVEN COMPLAINTS THAT WERE NOT THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED TO ME THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY AND THAT'S WHERE THE RECOMMENDATIONS GO. IN MAYBE NOT FOR DISCUSSION TODAY BUT THIS. THE ABILITY TO FILE ANONYMOUSLY -- BUT STILL BE CONTACTED POTENTIALLY BY INVESTIGATORS SO IN OTHER WORDS YOUR NAME. COULD YOUR NAME BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE COMPLAINT. BUT NOT NECESSARILY SHARED WITH THE JUDICIAL OFFICER AGAINST TO THE COMPLAINTS BEING MADE WITHOUT. THE STAFF INVESTIGATOR SEEKING. THAT AUTHORIZATION FROM THE COMPLAINANT THE COMPLAINANT MAY RATHER WITHDRAW THEIR COMPLAINT. THEN HAVE A GO FORWARD WITH THE JUDGE. KNOWING THAT THERE THE ONE MAKING THE COMPLAINT PARTICULARLY FOR AN ATTORNEY PARTICULARLY FOR SOMEBODY WHO WORKS IN THE COURTS SO. COULD YOU SPLIT IT THAT WAY WERE YOU YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. BUT FOR A COMPLAINT TO GO FORWARD THE INVESTIGATOR MIGHT ADVISE THE COMPLAINANT. WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE YOUR NAME. TO PURSUE THE COMPLAINT. AND IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT SO SEE JP ALREADY. AT THAT DOES WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING SO THEY WILL RECEIVE A COMPLAINT IT COULD BE SUBMITTED TO THEM ANONYMOUSLY SAID BAY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S COMPLAINING SO THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO GO BACK TO RIGHT BUT THERE ARE INSTANCES IN WHICH MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH THE COMPLAINT AND ATTACH AS THEIR NAME. HOWEVER IT CJ'S PEAS PRACTICE NOT TO DISCLOSE THE NAME OF THE COMPLAINANT TO THE JUDGE IF THEY CONTACT THE JUDGE AND WE SAW THEM FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THAT PRACTICE WHEN THEY CONTACT THE JUDGE THEY DO NOT NAME THE COMPLAINANT. NOW. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE PROBABLY SITUATIONS WHERE. JUDGES COULD INFER BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DO ABOUT THAT BUT SEE IF HE'S NOT ACTIVELY DISCLOSING THE NAME OF COMPLAINTS. THANK YOU AND I THINK MAKING THAT CLEAR NOT JUST TO THE PUBLIC BUT TO OFFICERS OF THE COURT MAKING SURE ATTORNEYS. NO THAT IN COURT STAFF BUT AS YOU SAY BASED ON THE NATURE. OF THE ALLEGED CONDUCT NAM THAT ME. MAY REVEAL WHO THE COMPLAINANT IS. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WORTH NOTING WE DO SEE CJ ALSO -- WE DID CCG ALSO MAKING CERTAIN DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN TO COMMENCE AN INVESTIGATION THAT FACTORED IN WHETHER PERHAPS THERE WAS AN ONGOING COURT CASE. SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE ASKED IN THIS AUDIT IS DO DOES HE J. P. DIFFER OR DELAY INVESTIGATION OF CASES -- OR ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT IN THE ANSWER IS YES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IF THE COURT CASE IN QUESTION IS STILL ON GOING CGP WILL DECIDE TO TO FOR ITS INVESTIGATION TOLD THE QUÃ© UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THE CASE -- SPECIFICALLY FOR RETALIATORY CONCERNS ME. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I THINK. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FUNCTION IS. IS FOR THIS COMMISSION'S. WORK TO ALSO. SERVE TO EDUCATE SITTING JUDGES ON THE BENCH AND BE A DETERRENT THAT. THAT YOU CAN'T GET AWAY WITH CERTAIN MISCONDUCT IN SOME OF IT IT'S A LEDGE IS SO EGREGIOUS AND IF THERE'S A FINDING. THAT IT IN FACT HAPPENED OR CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. THOSE FINDINGS AND DISCIPLINE OR FROM THE BENCH. NEED TO BE BROADLY PUBLICIZED. THROUGHOUT THE JUDICIAL COMMUNITY -- TO SERVE A DETERRENT. PURPOSES WHILE BUT AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE ALL DOING IN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER MINING US CENTER CUBBY GYRO FOLLOWED BY SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- FIRST LET ME SAY THAT I AM REALLY APPRECIATE THE REPORT -- EIGHT THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN REGARDS TO THE BICAMERAL SYSTEM I THINK THAT -- PROBABLY THE WAY THAT WE NEED TO TO MOVE ON THIS AND AND THE THE NEED FOR A ROBUST INTAKE SYSTEM -- I DON'T THINK THE PUBLIC HAS A CLUE QUITE FRANKLY I PRACTICE TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE COURT NEVER SAW ANYTHING THAT INVITES ME. HOW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT -- AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA IN SOME OF THE CASES -- JUST BECAUSE IN ORDER TO GET YOU TO CHAU TEMPERAMENT IS SO IMPORTANT IN IN IN. THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PUBLIC BUT ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS IN AND MAYBE YOU COULD -- ELUCIDATE A LITTLE BIT IS MY CONCERN WITH THE TIME THAT IT TOOK. MANY OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS -- IS IT AN ISSUE OF MONEY. OR IS IT AN ISSUE I MEAN I MEAN EVERYTHING IS RECORDED IN IN MOST OF THE COURTS -- IT'S EITHER RECORDED OR THERE'S A REPORTER AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT A JUDGE YOU'D THINK I'D BE FAIRLY SIMPLE. TO PULL UP THAT INFORMATION OR TO GET. THE WHICH WHO WHOEVER WAS. IN THE COURTROOM AT THE TIME TO GET INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S ALL ON THE DOCKET AND SO I'M WONDERING -- I'M WONDERING THAT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS -- IT'S REALLY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE SYSTEM HAS TO INCLUDE A TRACKING SYSTEM AS WELL SO THAT THE INVESTIGATORS CAN GO BACKWARDS AND LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT -- IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY. THAT WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE BEHAVIOR FROM. FROM -- THE DECISIONS THAT THE RENDERING. IT APPEARS TO ME IN THE RESEARCH THAT YOU DID THAT. LEGAL ERROR. IS IT IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE LEGAL HEIR TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S AN IN INHERENT BIAS. THE THE THE JUDGES EXHIBITING AS WELL AND IN THE ONLY WAY YOU GET THERE IS IF THE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TRACKING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS YOU TO GO BACK AND SEE WHO'S COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS AND AND IS IT A PATTERN OVER PEER TYPE SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU. COULD COMMENT ON BOTH OF THOSE THOSE ISSUE AND BOTH OF THOSE BY THE WAY RELATE TO MONEY AND THAT'S WHY. WHY AM QUÃ© I'M FOCUSED ON THAT? SO WITH REGARD TO THE TIMELINESS OF INVESTIGATIONS AS I MENTIONED JUST A MOMENT AGO THERE ARE TIMES WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE AN INVESTIGATION FROM ABSOLUTE START ABSOLUTE FINISH MAYBE TAKES. LONGER THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT AND THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN INTENTIONALLY DELAYED -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS TO DO THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR KEY CONCERN WITH THE TIMELINESS OF THE INVESTIGATIONS THOUGH IS THAT THEY WEREN'T AS SIEGE OF HE'S NOT. EVEN BOTHERING OR HASN'T BEEN IDENTIFYING -- AN EXPECTED LENGTH OF INVESTIGATION THOSE INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO -- ARE SORT OF THE FIRST INDICATOR FOR WHETHER THERE'D -- MOVING THROUGH THE INVESTIGATIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH WE'RE NOT SEEING THEM PRE PLANNING THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THESE ARE THE STEPS I'M GOING TO TAKE IN ABOUT HOW LONG I THINK BEFORE I'LL BE DONE -- THAT'S THE IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN MAKING SURE THE INVESTIGATIONS PROCEED IN A TIMELY FASHION. OUR TO COLLECTING THE DATA YES I AM A MORE SUBSTANTIVE -- DATA SYSTEM WILL ALLOW THEM TO START TRACKING A MORE SUBSTANTIVE DATA SYSTEM AND BETTER PRACTICES WITH CODING THEIR COMPLAINTS SO. WE DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THE LEGAL ERROR CASES WERE NOT BEING TRACKED APPROPRIATELY EVEN IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM. TO SEE JP SHOULD SHORE UP ITS PRACTICES FOR CODING COMPLAINTS BUT ONCE THEY HAVE A NEW SYSTEM IT'LL BE A FAR LESS LABOR INTENSIVE PROCESS FOR THEM TO RUN TRENDING. TO LOOK BACKWARDS AND THEN SEE IF LEGAL AIR IS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ISOLATED -- UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING COMMITTED IN GOOD FAITH WITHOUT L. INTENT OR WHETHER IT'S INDICATIVE OF A PATTERN THAT ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES MISCONDUCT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN. ONCE AGAIN ECHO THE COMMITTEES -- PRAISE FOR THIS REPORT. BOB I WAS INTERESTED I HAVE YOU SEEN ANY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN -- COMPLAINTS -- DIRECTED TOWARD JUDGES WHO ARE ELECTED RATHER THAN APPOINTED. WE DID THAT TYPE OF AN ANALYSIS AND WE FOUND NO CORRELATION OF AMONG THE OUTCOME OF COMPLAINTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEPENDENT OF IF THE JUDGE WAS ELECTED OR APPOINTED LITTLE [inaudible] NO CORRELATION. FASCINATING OKAY THANK YOU. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. THANK YOU CHAIR. JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON PAGE. FIFTY ONE ON THE THE SIDE PANEL IT SAYS WHEN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT ATTORNEY SUBMITTED COMPLAINTS C. J. P. WAS NEARLY COMPLAINTS WITHOUT PERFORMING AN INVESTIGATION. COMPARED TO WHEN ATTORNEYS SUBMITTED THEM NOW ON THE SURFACE. FROM OF A LAY PERSON'S VIEWPOINT THAT WOULD TELL ME IT'S A STACKED DECK UNLESS YOU'RE WITHIN THE THE PROFESSION YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET A HEARING. NOW. WE'RE SENATOR JACKSON'S POINTS AND OTHER POINTS. BEING MADE. THERE. MUST BE A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AND SIMPLY. SOUR GRAPES ABOUT YOUR OUTCOME SO IT WAS THAT WHY YOU PUT THIS IN HERE. I'M I'M JUST A HAZY ON IT NO THIS IS TO SO. WE FOUND THIS FACT IN SUPPORT OF OUR CONCLUSION THAT CJ BE COULD BE DOING MORE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT IS AND ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO SUBMIT. ORDER FOR ITS COMPLAINT TO BE FORWARDED ON TO AN INVESTIGATION -- CERTAINLY AS WE KNOW IN THE REPORT ON THIS PAGE THERE ARE REASONS WHY -- ATTORNEYS FOR A PEOPLE WHO ARE AROUND THE COURTHOUSE IS MORE OFTEN THAN THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD BE MADE. THEY MAY JUST OBSERVE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT MORE FREQUENTLY DUE TO THAT PROXIMITY BUT WE DO THINK THAT THIS INDICATES THAT CGP COULD BE DOING MORE TO EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC AGAIN AS I SAID WHAT IS MISCONDUCT. AND ALSO WHAT INFORMATION DOES IT NEED OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY IS IN THE DIRECTION OF PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF WHAT A HIGH QUALITY COMPLAINT LOOKS LIKE. INDICATE CLEARLY THAT YOU DO WANT -- INDIVIDUALS TO SUBMIT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION IF THEY DO HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW THE WEBSITES MORE SUGGESTIVE THAN IT IS IN ON SORT OF REALLY SAYING YES GIVE THAT TO US. SO THAT'S WHY WE MADE THIS OBSERVATION IS IN SUPPORT OF BETTER PUBLIC EDUCATION THE TEACHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK WHEN. LAWYERS AND THOSE AROUND THE COURTHOUSE ACTUALLY LODGE A COMPLAINT. HE DO SO BECAUSE OF THEY DO SO AT THEIR OWN PERIL. IN MANY RESPECTS THAT'S WHERE THEY DO THE THAT'S WHERE THEY CONDUCT THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND IF THE COURT. WERE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THAT WHICH IS WHY I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS SOME ANONYMITY -- IT COULD BE VERY DIFFICULT. ON THE OTHER HAND. THE QUESTION ABOUT WHEN YOU ENGAGE THE COURT TO DIRECTLY INQUIRE -- FOR EXAMPLE A COMPLAINT HASBEEN LARGE THAT% YOU CONTINUALLY HARASS -- JURY PANELS AND DEMEAN THEM WHAT IS YOUR PROCESS WHAT ARE YOU DOING. I WONDER IF IF WE ENGAGE THE COURTS EARLIER WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO REMEDY THAT BEHAVIOR PARTICULARLY IF WE NOW ADD TO THE C. J. P. -- AUTHORITY THE ABILITY TO DO THAT EDUCATION AND TRAINING. OUR THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP. I I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IT IN IT HAPPENS IN MANY PROFESSIONS YOU DO SOMETHING LONG ENOUGH YOU YOU LOSE SIGHT OF OF THE CONTEXT OF YOUR BEHAVIOR SOMETIMES AND HOW YOU'RE PERCEIVED BY THE BY THE PUBLIC AND JUST GETTING THAT. ADDITIONAL TRAINING OR EDUCATION OR ESSENTIALLY BEING CALLED OUT FOR IT CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD SO I HOPE THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE LOOK AT SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY HELPFUL I THINK A VERY POSITIVE. WE FINALLY DID GET THIS. AUDIT CHEN I'M VERY GLAD THAT YOU PERSISTED AND THAT MY COLLEAGUES ALSO. IN IN MAKING SURE THAT WE GOT -- THAT INFORMATION AND AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO CALL UP THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. AND WOULD NOTE THAT WE NOW HAVE A FAIRLY NEW. LEADERSHIP DAD AS I UNDERSTAND HAS TAKEN THIS AUDIT VERY SERIOUSLY -- AND IS IMPLEMENTING. THE REFORMS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED AS WELL SO -- I'M SUPPOSED TO ALSO REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVE -- UP TO TEN MINUTES FOR OPENING COMMENTS. AND THEN WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS GOOD GOOD MORNING MORNING THANK YOU -- SENATOR JACKSON'S -- MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEES -- I'M GREGORY DRESSER I'VE BEEN THE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF COUNSEL OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE SENSE. A JANUARY OF LAST YEAR I'M HERE WITH -- CHARLENE DRUMMER WHO'S THE LEGAL ADVISER TO THE COMMISSION -- YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HER POSITION IN THE PRIOR PRESENTATION AND ALSO WITH -- CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION ON NEED TO MISSION MORE WHO IS A PRACTICING ATTORNEY I'LL TRY TO KEEP A CALM COMMENTS A VERY BRIEF AS YOU ALL KNOW. OF THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT STATE AGENCY THAT WAS A STOP. BY THE CONSTITUTION AS THE AUDIT REPORT NOTED ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES TO THE AUTHORITY OF OR STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION -- HOUSE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY -- CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THE TH THE THREE PURPOSES OF THE COMMISSION WHICH I KNOW EACH COMMISSION MEMBER TAKES VERY SERIOUSLY ARE. TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. TO UPHOLD HIGH STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT. AND TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY. AND YOU ALL YOURSELVES SPOKE ABOUT JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE EARLIER AND I COULD NOT PUT IT BETTER AS I LIKE TO SAY TO MY FRIENDS -- JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE YOU MAY NOT NOTICE IT AND ALSO LIKE OXYGEN YOU MAY NOT NOTICE IT BUT YOU ARE SAD WHEN BOTH ARE GONE -- IS SO IT IN THE IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT THE CONSTITUTION PROVIDES THAT THE COMMISSION -- CAN MAKE RULES FOR CONFIDENTIALITY AND IT HAS DONE THAT -- DICK CONFIDENTIALITY SERVES AT LEAST TWO IMPORTANT PURPOSES ONE IT PROTECTS THE IDENTITY. PLANETS AND WITNESSES WHO MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE COMPLAIN TO THE COMMISSION. IT ALSO ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO OBTAIN. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION FROM COMPLAINANTS AND WITNESSES. AND REPORTS OF MISCONDUCT THAT THAT PEOPLE OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT MAKE THEY WOULD NOT MAKE IT IF WE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THEM CONFIDENTIALITY. CONFIDENTIALITY ALSO PREVENTS FALSE RUMORS ABOUT JUDGES IT PROTECTS THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMMISSION'S PROCESS IN IT ALSO PREVENTS THE USE OF COMPLAINTS TO THE COMMISSION. FOR THE IMPROPER COLLATERAL PURPOSE OF AFFECTING WHAT GOES ON IN COURT OR WHO JUDGES ON A PARTICULAR CASE -- JUST SOME -- DETAILS ABOUT THE COMMISSION -- AND AGAIN I I KNOW THAT YOU ALL KNOW THEM BUT JUST -- TO JUST PUT THEM ALL OUT THERE THERE ARE LEFT THERE ARE ELEVEN COMMISSION MEMBERS SIX OF THEM ARE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. TWO OF THEM ARE ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE BEEN PRACTICING -- IN CALIFORNIAFOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. TWO OF THEM ARE SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES AND ONE IS A COURT OF APPEAL JUSTICE ALL OF THE COMMISSIONMEMBERS. ARE VOLUNTEERS. COMMISSIONHAVE FOR OF FOR A VOLUNTEER COMMISSION THE COMMISSION MEMBERS HAVE A VERY HEAVY WORKLOAD I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT -- ON THE MODEST SIDE COMMISSION MEMBERS SPEND TWO TO THREE HUNDRED HOURS A YEAR ON ON COMMISSION WORK ON UNCOMPENSATED BASIS. ALTHOUGH THE COMMISSION'S IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH -- FOR OF THE COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR OUR APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND THE THREE JUDGES WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION ARE APPOINTED BY. THE SUPREME COURT. THE COMMISSION IS A SMALL AGENCY THE COMMISSION HAS TWENTY TWO EMPLOYEES INCLUDING MS DRUMMER AND MYSELF FOURTEEN OF WHOM -- OUR ATTORNEYS -- LAST YEAR -- WE WHEN WE APPEARED BEFORE -- THE ASSEMBLY -- BUDGET COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE WE THERE WERE -- SERIOUS CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT ON THE LAWSUIT THAT WAS THEN PENDING -- THE LAWSUIT -- TOOK PLACE BECAUSE THE COMMISSION DID HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ITS CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS AND ALSO MAINTAINING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THOSE RECORDS ONCE. THEY WERE PART OF THE LAW AUDITOR'S FILES IN AT LEAST ARGUABLY SUBJECT TO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IN. THE COMMISSION FILED AN ACTION TO SEEK GUIDANCE FROM THE COURTS ON THE ISSUE WE WE DEFINITELY. GOT THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR I HAVE -- INDELIBLE MEMORY OF THINGS THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE SAID TO ME -- LAST MAY AND WE DID MOVE FORWARD AND WE SETTLED THE LAWSUIT WE WE SIGNED A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN -- IN JULY. AND THAT -- YOU KNOW THAT DID -- PART OF THE PART OF THE SETTLEMENT OF PROVIDED FOR THE PARTIES -- TO SECORD LEASE NOT OPPOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF COMMISSION RECORDS. IT ALSO -- REQUIRED THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER -- RULE CHANGES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE AUDITOR TO ACCESS -- CONFIDENTIAL COMMISSION RECORDS AND THE COMMISSION ARE CONSIDERED AND ENACTED SUCH A RULE -- WE DID SETTLE LAWSUIT IN TIME FOR THE AUDIT TO BE COMPLETED -- BE BEFORE YOU TODAY -- FROM THE TIME WE SETTLED THE LAWSUIT THROUGH THE END OF THE AUDIT AND FRANKLY CONTINUING UNTIL TODAY. WE COOPERATED. FULLY WITH THE AUDIT THE COMMISSION INSTRUCTED ME TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUDIT I INSTRUCTED STAFF TO COOPERATE WITH THE AUDIT -- AND AS AS YOU KNOW FOR ALL OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS DIRECTED TO THE COMMISSION THE COMMISSION HAS EXPRESSED. THAT IT INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- REQUIRE A BUDGET INCREASE AND IT WHEN THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR BUDGET TO DO SO WE WILL WE WILL -- ACCOMPLISH THOSE ALSO. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE YOU TOO FAR INTO THE WEEDS -- IN TERMS OF EACH AND EVERY RECOMMENDATION IN THE AUDIT BUT I JUST WANT TO NOTE I'M WE'VE WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN IN. THE RECOMMENDATIONS -- FOR YOU KNOW IMMEDIATE ACTION INCLUDING GIVING STAFF INSTRUCTION ABOUT -- CODING OF ALLEGATIONS SO THAT -- THEY'RE MORE APPROPRIATE AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED LATER TO TRACK TRENDS WE'VE -- EXPLORED OPTIONS -- FOR READ LOCATING THE COMMISSION'S OFFICE THERE ARE OF COURSE PRACTICAL AND ALSO LEGAL -- RESTRICTIONS AROUND OUT BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DOING WE ARE -- WE'RE IMPLEMENTING A PROCESS FOR MANAGEMENT TO REVIEW AND APPROVE INVESTIGATIVE STRATEGIES AND TO ESTABLISH DEADLINES FOR INVESTIGATIONS -- THE LEGAL ADVISER HAS -- FORMULATED PROCEDURES TO CONDUCT PERIODIC REVIEWS OF CLOSED INVESTIGATIONS TO MAKE SURE THE INVESTIGATIONS WERE. DONE APPROPRIATELY AND THOROUGHLY. WE'VE -- CREATED AND IMPLEMENTED PROCEDURES FOR INVESTIGATING ATTORNEYS TO REVIEW. PRIOR COMPLAINTS TO ASSESS SIMILARITIES AND PATTERNS WITH -- WITH PRIOR COMPLAINTS AND YOU KNOW AS WE NOTED IN THE IN OUR RESPONSE TO THE DRAFT REPORT THAT WE SAW -- WE INTEND TO IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING BY THE RECOMMENDED DEADLINES. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON OTHER -- RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING RESEARCHING A NEW NEWER IMPROVED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM INCLUDING THE COST OF THAT. AND INCLUDING CUTTING COSTS IN -- OTHER PLACES. CAN I I WANNA JUST PAUSE BRIEFLY ON THE NOTION OF A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND I I I THINK THAT I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN THE WRONG IMPRESSION IN MY LETTER. IN TERMS OF AMENDING THE CONSTITUTION -- WE USED. THE COMMISSION BELIEVES THAT THAT'S A POLICY DECISION FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND ULTIMATELY THE VOTERS TO MAKE -- HI MY PLEASE IS THAT THAT BE SOMETHING THAT IS DONE WITH PRECISION AND CARE. BECAUSE IF IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY BIG OVERHAUL OF THE COMMISSION AND THE WAY THAT IT DOES ITS WORK -- I'D I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK ABOUT IN THINK THROUGH. WHAT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WILL -- WILL SAY AND THE RESULTS THAT IT WILL -- THAT IT WILL GET -- MY WHAT I DISPUTED -- NOT THE AMENDMENT ITSELF MY DISPUTE WAS WITH THE COMMENT THAT THERE WAS A DUE PROCESS PROBLEM WITH THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DUE PROCESS PROBLEM WITH THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE DUE PROCESS THE THE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE PROVIDED TO JUDGES WHO ARE IN THE PROCESS IS. THEY HAVE TO RECEIVE NOTICE OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM WHICH WE PROVIDE AND THE JUDGES HAVE TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THOSE ALLEGATIONS. AND DEFEND HERSELF OR HIMSELF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE PROVIDED I SUBMIT THEY ARE PROVIDED EXTENSIVELY -- THE CURRENT THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE HAS EXISTED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN. A SIEVE -- A SUCCESSFUL DUE PROCESS CHALLENGE TO THE STRUCTURE OF COMMISSION. THE REMEMBER THE PARTIES INVOLVED IN COMMISSION PROCEEDINGS ARE -- OUR JUDGES THEIR SOPHISTICATED THEY KNOW THE LAW AND THEY ALSO ALL HAVE GOOD COUNSEL. IF THERE ARE CHALLENGS TO BE MADE I SUBMIT THAT THEY WILL MAKE THEM. SO -- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE BASICALLY THE SUM AND SUBSTANCE OF MY COMMENTS I THE ONE THING THAT I WANT TO MENTION WILL HAVE SO MANY OF YOU -- BECAUSE THERE WAS A COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT. ALL PROCEEDINGS BEING. SCRIBE A RECORDED THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF PROCEEDINGS IN COURT BAT OR THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT TRANSCRIBED AND THEY'RE NOT RECORDED AND I SUBMIT BEYOND. THE COMMISSION -- THE FAILURE TO HAVE A RECORD OF PROCEEDINGS PRESENTS AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUE. THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS AND WHAT I WOULD JUST MY PLEA IS. IF THERE IS A WAY A ON AT THE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL TO PROVIDE THAT THAT MORE OR FRANKLY ALL PROCEEDINGS IN COURT BE TRANSCRIBED A RECORDED. I AM I PERSONALLY AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THAT THAT WILL MAKE THE BELLAMY COMMISSION'S WORK -- EASIER BETTER AND MORE THOROUGH. DOESN'T IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- TO EITHER OF THE TWO IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT. AT THIS POINT IN TIME PHYLLIS SO WE'VE GOTTEN. A LOT OF GENERALITIES HERE AND I'D LIKE TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO THE SUBSTANCE. BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO BEFORE YOU DIE. SPEAK THE ONE THING THE ONE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE WITH THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE -- THE AUDITOR. IDENTIFIED THAT DO. SLACKING BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS UNITARY POLICY VIOLATEDIT I WILL TELL YOU I THINK THE COURTS THEMSELVES SAY THAT BECAUSE AS I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO DUE PROCESS AND TITLE. NINE THE COURTS HAVE ALSO INDICATED THAT THEY THINK HAVING A SINGULAR. INVESTIGATOR JUDGE AND JURY PROCESS VIOLATES DUE PROCESS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE SO. WHILE WE MADE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE. THE AUDITOR DID RECOMMEND THAT YOU CHANGE THAT PROCESS AND I MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO THAT IRRESPECTIVE ALL OF THE APPARENT DISAGREEMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. SENATE JACKSON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUDIT REPORT IS THAT IT RECOMMENDS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION TO A BICAMERAL AGENCY. THE COMMISSION ITSELF DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT AND I DO AGREE WITH THE AUDIT REPORT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. AND IF THAT IS THE DETERMINATION OF THE LEGISLATURE -- AND THE VOTERS OF THE STATE -- STE SO BE IT MY ONLY PLEA IS THAT THAT JUST BE DONE THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY THAT IS ALL I CARE ABOUT. THANK YOU -- THE THERE I JUST ALL I WANNA DO IS IS SAFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS AUDIT HAS BEEN VERY PRODUCTIVE. A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND I AND I FEEL SINCERELY THAT WE WILL ALL BE BETTER FOR IT WE ALL OF US HERE ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS. YOU HAVE DEVOTED YOUR CAREERS JUST SERVE THE PUBLIC. I'M SICK I'M JUST A HUMBLE VOLUNTEER HERE -- BY DAY I'M A PRACTICING LAWYER CULTURE PEACHTREE MCCARTHY -- I VIEW MY ROLE HERE WITH THE COMMISSION AS A BRIDGE I'M SIMPLY A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC. AND THE COMMISSION AND THE COURT SYSTEM I'M IN COURT ALL THE TIME I HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT I DIDN'T KNOW IT. AND NOW SINCE SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. THERE ARE NO COURT REPORTERS THERE ARE NO REPORTERS WE HAVE TO PAY FOR OUR OWN COURT REPORTERS AND GOD KNOWS HOPE HOPE. SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS ARE REALLY STRUGGLING AND OUR JOB AS THE COMMISSION IS TO HELP GIVE THEM A VOICE WHEN THEY FEEL THEY'VE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY AND THEY DON'T. LIKE YOU'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT VERSUS AN UNFAIR -- OF A DECISION AGAINST THAT. RIGHT WE STRUGGLE TO GET THROUGH THAT AND WE TRY TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. WE WE RELEASED WE REALLY DO PART OF THE ISSUES COURT FUNDING -- BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS IS. BEEN A LONG PROCESS AND IT'S BEEN A VERY PRODUCTIVE. ONE AND I KNOW THAT HAVING SEEN. HOW THE? CGP OPERATED PRIOR TO YOUR EITHER SHIP. IT'S A WELCOME REFRESHING CHANGE. TO SERVE OPEN UP -- THE CONCEPTS IN THE DISCUSSION. ARE AND YOU MAKE A VERY GOOD POINT WITH -- SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS BEING MORE AND MORE PART OF THE PROCESS -- THE FRUSTRATION THAT THEY FEEL SOMETIMES THE FRUSTRATION THE COURT FEELS -- WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN WHO DON'T KNOW THE RULES -- IT IT IT CAN BE CHALLENGING BUT I THINK BETTER EDUCATING OUR JUDGES AND TRYING TO EDUCATE OUR LITIGANTS. IS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO START DOING MORE MORE BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE PREDOMINANT IN OUR COURTS. YEP JUST VERY IMPORTANT TO US GREAT SO I GO TO THE ROTARY CLUB I AM TALKING TO PEOPLE I MAKE. SURE I THE VENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED A SENATOR. ALLEN AND THEN WOULD YOU IS ARE YOU THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR NOW OR LEGAL ADVISER SO YOU'RE GOING -- TO ASSOCIATE YOUR REMARKS WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. I JUST WANTED TO INVITE YOU IF YOU HAD ANYTHING TO ADD. I REALLY DON'T I SUPPORT WHAT QUE. THANK YOU. WE LOOK FORWARD TO COOPERATING% ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO HELP IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN. YEAH I'D I'D JUST IT IT SEEMS LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT -- I WAS TALKING TO CENTER MINING YOU MENTION THAT SOMEONE HE KNOWS ESTIMATES THEY SPEND ABOUT TWENTY HOURS A WEEK ON THIS SORT OF WORK. I MEAN I I JUST SO. I HOW IS IT POSSIBLE AND I'M JUST INTERESTED MAYBE THE COMMITTEE HAS SOME THOUGHTS OR OR THAT YOU FOLKS. ARE AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME FORM OF COMPENSATION I UNDERSTAND THE JUDGES SERVING ON THE COMMISSION. ARE BEING PAID TO BE JUDGES BUT OFFER EVERYBODY ELSE FOR WHOM THIS IS THIS IS SUCH A WE WE HAVE ALL THE VOTE OURSELVES THE PUBLIC SERVICE WE ARE AT LEAST GETTING A SALARY -- YOU KNOW I JAY DID IT DOES. COMING BY MAKE ME WONDER WHAT WHETHER WE OUGHT TO CREATE SOME SORT OF COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THE FOLKS ARE. ARE ARE ARE BEING COMPENSATED FOR THIS EXTRAORDINARY ACTIVE -- OF OF PUBLIC SERVICES AGENCIES THAT DELETING THE CONSTITUTION IT DOES ALLOW FOR IT OR I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. SO. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THAT WITH WITH SOME OF THOSE SIX PUBLIC MEMBERS IT IS A BURDEN THEY DO NOT GET PAID WHEN THEY'RE AT COMMISSION MEETINGS AND WE MEET PROBABLY. EVERY SIX WEEKS. BUT SOMETIMES TWO DAYS IN A ROW AND IT TAKES MANY MANY HOURS TO PREPARE THEY'RE NOT PAID ON TIME AND I'M A PARTNER AT A LAW FIRM. MY LAW FIRM IS IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT I DO I'M HERE ON MY OWN TIME TODAY THIS IS MY OTHER LEGAL COLLEAGUE HE HAS HIS OWN PRACTICE SO IF HE'S NOT AT THE OFFICE HE'S NOT GETTING. PAID -- YEAH THAT'S SO THAT'S FOR ME IT'S ALRIGHT. FOR ME I'M AN UNUSUAL SITUATION AS WELL BECAUSE I LIVE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED MILES OF THE COMMISSION'S OFFICES AND THEREFORE I DON'T HAVE GET REIMBURSED TO STAY IN A HOTEL. I I DRIVE BUT I HAPPILY. VOLUNTEER MY TIME I PAY MY OWN WAY I DO NOT BILLS TO THE COMMISSION BECAUSE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. I BELIEVE IN PUBLIC SERVICE LIKE YOU DO AND I'M WILLING TO DO THIS AND I SUPPORT MY COLLEAGUES HERE BECAUSE YEAH I DON'T THINK PEOPLE OUT A A RICH DOING THIS BUT I DO THINK THERE OUGHT TO BE SOME FORM OF COMPETITION I GET I MEAN WHAT. HOW WHY IS IT THAT THEY'RE NOT COMPENSATED WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE IS THERE LEGAL BARRIERS IS JUST PRACTICES? SO IT'S BEEN THAT WAY -- FOREVER AS FAR AS I KNOW AND THEN THE AND THEN THE OTHER REASON WOULD BE BUDGETARY. SIR SURE. OKAY WHY I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY IF IT YOU KNOW AS WELL AS IT WAS THIS CONSIDERED AT ALL BY THE AUDIT. HE COULD HEAR FROM ONE OF YOU ABOUT. TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS. SO AGAIN BOB HARRIS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE I'M THE ONE AREA IN WHICH WE SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER COMPENSATION WAS WITH OUR PROPOSAL. TO HAVE THE COMMISSION HERE AT SOME CASES AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THE COMMISSION HAD EXPRESSED TO US ABOUT THE UNCOMPENSATED NATURE OF THE COMMISSIONERS -- SO WE THEIR OWN CASES WOULD MEAN SO WHERE IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE PROPOSING INSTEAD OF USING THE SPECIAL MASTERS TO REVIEW TO HOLD THE EVIDENTIARY HEARINGS THE COMMISSIONERS THEMSELVES WHAT ACTUALLY SET FOR THE EVIDENTIARY HEARING THEMSELVES. TO US THAT WAS AN EXTRA ASK IT'S SOMETHING THE COMMISSIONERS ARE NOT CURRENTLY DOING RIGHT -- SO WE DEVELOPED A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF WHAT. MY MISSION PACKAGER LOOK LIKE TO PAY THEM FOR THEIR TIME TO DO THAT SO THAT SPECIFIC THING FOR THAT SPECIFIC THING NOT FOR THE REGULAR SERVICE THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY CONDUCTING THAT'S THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE LOOKED AT COMPENSATION. THAT'S SIX INTO WHICH THAT'S THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE LOOKED AT COMPENSATION A HIGH -- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE BAT BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW PINE ON WHETHER THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE TO THE CONVERSATION THE FACT THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY UNCOMPENSATED I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T DO THEIR PART BUT WOULD YOU OPINE. WE HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION IN THAT AREA OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN THE OFFENSE AT THAT IS AN ISSUE. TO WORK ON BY THAT'S REALLY MINOR IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE AND PERHAPS IF WE COME UP WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFERENCE OF A PACKAGE WE THAT MAY BE SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT BUT YOU'RE ALSO TALKING TO A GROUP OF LEGISLATORS WHO'VE. DONE LOTS OF THINGS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS I WAS A COASTAL COMMISSIONER WHICH TOOK MORE THAN A QUARTER OF MY TIME. UNCOMPENSATED SO THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE DO BECAUSE WE NEED TO AND THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO FUNCTION BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT ON ON THE BUDGET THE OTHER DID MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON SOME FUNDING INTO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DO THIS LEGISLATURE TO DO THAT. AS WAYS FUNDING PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WE TEND TO THROW MONEY OVER THE WALL IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SPENDS ITS MONEY. AND BEFORE WE COME UP WITH LINE ITEM RECOMMENDATIONS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM BROADER. DOESN'T ALREADY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO THIS WHAT'S BEING ASKED IS NOT A LOT OF MONEY. POTENTIALLY AND THERE ARE POTS OF MONEY IN THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE SO. THAT THAT'S A SIDE. ISSUE IN MY MAIN QUESTION BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THAT BE USED AS AN EXCUSE TO NOT MAKING PROGRESS ON THIS BUT SO MY MAIN QUESTION IS. WHAT'S YOUR ACTION PLAN YOU'VE AGREED YOU'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS THAT'S WONDERFUL. WHEN HOW WHAT'S THE WHAT ARE THE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MADE NOW WHAT'S THE TIME LINE HOW IS THAT GOING TO ROLL OUT? BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS IS GOING TO BE KEY AS WE CONTINUE TO TRACK THIS AND AND AND UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. YOUR POINT ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WHICH COULD BE FUNDAMENTAL TO THIS. WELL TAKEN AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO DO IT. YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN BEFORE US BEFORE IF YOU EXPECT US TO DO THINGS THAT ARE DETAILED AND EXACT AND CORRECTION THE FIRST TIME THROUGH BUT WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION THAT'S WIDE. BUT ALL THOSE A BACKDROP TO THE COMMITMENT TO THE PROCESS CHANGES THAT NEED TO HAPPEN SO WHAT'S THE WORK PLAN. SO AT THE I MEAN AT THE MOST GENERAL LEVEL THE AUDIT REPORT HAS -- NOT JUST RECOMMENDATIONS BUT TIME FRAMES FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND WE ARE THE INTENTION IS. TO IT FOR THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITHOUT WITHOUT EXTRA FUNDING TO DO THEM BY THE DATES RECOMMENDED AND ALSO TO WORK ON ALL OF THEM -- YOU KNOW NOW I ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND TO IMPLEMENT THEM -- EARLY I MEAN BY MY COUNT WE HAVE THERE ARE THREE OR FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. I THINK ARE FULLY OR NEARLY FULLY -- RECOMMENDED -- THE DEADLINES FOR WHICH WERE IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR OR EVEN APRIL OF NEXT YEAR SO ARE YOU KNOW OUR PLAN IS TO MOVE THEM ALL FORWARD. AND AND TO DEFINITELY ACCOMPLISH THEM BY THE DATES THAT THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS. OKAY SO THE OTHER REPORT THEN IS YOUR FRAMEWORK FOR WORKING ON THAT DIRECT YES I THINK WE WOULD APPRECIATE AND I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS. I'M NOT COMPLETELY SURE HOW J. LACK OPERATES OR ITS FUNCTION BUT AS A COMMITTEE CHAIR AND I DO WANT TO SPEAK FOR MY KIND OF BUT WE WOULD LOVE TO BE KEPT ABREAST I THINK OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE THE TIME LINES. THINGS IT CAN GET DONE EARLIER AND THERE ARE SOME DETAILS FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THE ERRORS THAT I FIND IT I FIND THIS KIND OF ACROSS. GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS WE TEND TO LOOK AT SNAPSHOTS FROM TIME TO TIME AND SO WE MISS. PATTERNS PICKING UP PATTERNS IS A FUNDAMENTAL THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S CULTURAL PROCEDURAL THERE ARE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PATTERNS GET GET IDENTIFIED I DON'T KNOW HAT THAT THE AUDIT REPORT DIDN'T GO INTO. THAT MUCH DETAIL BUT FROM YOUR STANDPOINT SINCE YOU HAVE. THE OPERATIONAL FUNCTION YOU HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO DO THIS HOW DO YOU ADDRESS. THAT THE CHANGES NECESSARY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING BROADER SCOPE RATHER THAN SO SPECIFICALLY. IN TERMS OF LOOKING BROADLY AND I MEAN FRANKLY AS THE AUDIT -- REPORT RECOMMENDS -- FOR MATTERS THAT THAT COME IN AND CERTAINLY FOR INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE OPENED WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK AT ALL OF THE PRIOR COMPLAINTS. AND TO SEE IF THERE'S A PATTERN I MEAN THERE ARE THERE FRANKLY DUE PROCESS ISSUES. USING INVESTIGATIONS ON PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED BUT THERE MIGHT BE AN INDICATION THAT THAT THERE IS A PATTERN AND THE PATTERN IS ON GOING BUT SO PART OF THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE THROUGH -- DIFFERENT TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS LOOKING -- PRIOR COMPLAINTS I DO THINK ABOUT WITHIN NEW OR UPDATED OR MODIFIED CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THERE THERE MAY BE A WAY OF TRACKING IT ALSO ON THE DATA LEVEL. YEAH NAY NAY I UNDERSTAND THE DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THERE BUT A LOT OF THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES INTERNALLY ABOUT HOW YOU MANAGE THAT HOW YOU REPORTING ON ON WHAT YOU'RE USING FOR A DECISION. BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR SOMEONE TO HIDE BEHIND PRIOR COMPLAINS THAT SAID AND DONE AND YET THAT PATTERN OF SMALL ABUSES SHOWS A BLATANT DISREGARD. FOR THE LEVEL OF AUTHORITY THAT A JUDGE HAS BEEN GIVEN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THAT AGAIN UNDERMINE PUBLIC TRUST IN. PROVIDE SOME CHALLENGES TO TO THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC IN DEALING. THIS IS VERY SAID THE COURTS TO MAKE A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS FOR PEOPLE AND IF THEY ARE NOT. TRULY INDEPENDENCE AND I S. AND OBJECTIVE IN IN WHAT THEY HAVE THEN. PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT BECAUSE OF HUMAN FRAILTIES THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE GUARDING AGAIN RIGHT I I I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND I ALSO AGREE THAT PART OF IN TERMS OF TRYING. TO DETECT WHETHER THERE ARE PATTERNS THE CONCERN IS WHETHER IT'S CHRONIC AND ONGOING AND AND I AGREE THAT -- THERE'S THERE SHOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVE METHODS -- FOR FOR FOR LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THAT IN IN YOU CAN SET STANDARDS FOR THAT THAT THEN ARE OBVIOUS AND IN MADE PUBLIC AND THAT'S SOME OF YOUR DUE PROCESS PROTECTION. RIGHT -- CENTER BY CASSIE ON THE SUGGESTION IS THAT WE GO WITH THE BICAMERAL -- COMMISSION SO THAT THEY THEY ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE DOING THE INVESTIGATION ARE NOT MAKING THE FINAL DECISION -- AFTER THE FORMAL PROCEEDINGS GO TO THE THE SPECIAL MASTER. DO YOU AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR THAT THAT THERE'S NO FLEXIBILITY IN THE WAY THAT THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE. NOW UNDER PROP ONE NINETY THAT IT SAID IT SEVEN MANNED. BECAUSE I SUGGESTED THAT YOU BUY FOR GAY TO COMMISSION YOU SAY YOU PEOPLE ARE DOING INVESTIGATIONS OUR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU PEOPLE MAKING. THE DECISIONS YOU AGREE WITH THEIR INCLUSION THAT EVERYBODY ALL ELEVEN COMMISSIONERS HAVE TO MAKE TO THE THE FINAL DECISION. THAT IS YES I THINK THAT'S THE WAY THAT. THAT THE CONSTITUTION CONSTITUTES THE COMMISSION NOW -- YES. OKAY IN ON I LOST MY PAGE. ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY MADE ON SAVING FIVE HUNDRED AND FOUR EIGHT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PAGE. FIFTY SEVEN AND FIFTY SIX ON THE CORE FUNCTIONS AND NOT -- IS MY UNDERSTANDING YOU ARE PROCEEDING WITH THE LOOKING FOR NEW LEASE -- PLACES SWITCHING TELEPHONE SYSTEMS ALL THOSE. SUGGESTIONS YES OKAY. I MEAN IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF MOVING I MEAN THERE ARE. THERE ARE LEGAL RESTRICTIONS AROUND OUR ABILITY TO MOVE AND THERE ARE. YOU KNOW PRACTICAL -- RESTRICTIONS INCLUDING THEIR BEING SPACE AVAILABLE IN IT YOU KNOW IN A IN A STATE BUILDING SINCE I REPRESENT THE TEN SENATE-DISTRICT. BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SUGGEST THAT YOU ALSO INCLUDE. HEY WORD OR FREMONT IN YOUR SEARCH FOR OTHER OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE EAST BAY JUST DON'T STOP IT OAKLAND IS. TO HELP MANY REPORTS ONLY SAY JUST GO TO OAKLAND. THANK YOU. THE PLENTY OF GOOD SPOTS AROUND THE STATE. THANK YOU SENATOR -- WE ASK THERE'S A YEAH OUR BIGGEST FILTER THE SALINAS VALLEY HERE. THE COAST. FURTHER UP NORTH -- SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HOW I'M GETTING CAUGHT UP HERE BUT WANTED ASKS JUST GENERALLY BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. AND ONE WAS THAT SOME VERY BASIC AND EASY TO DO WAS ACCEPTING COMPLAINTS ELECTRONICALLY -- ARE YOU STARTING TO DO THAT I KNOW WE HAVE A CHECK IN AT THE END OF JUNE. WHICH IS A SIXTY DAY CHECK IN AND THEN WE'LL HAVE KIND OF A PROGRESS REPORT AT THE END OF OCTOBER -- BUT IS CJ PEER WE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. SO SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING. YES I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY RESEARCHING IT AT YOU KNOW AT AS WE ARE RESEARCHING -- IMPROVEMENTS OR DO A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THAT WOULD ALLOW US -- TO TO ACCEPT -- COMPLAINTS ONLINE SO WE DO NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST OF THAT WOULD BE AN AND WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR IT BUT YES. OKAY SO RESEARCHING NOT WHETHER IT'S AFFECTED BUT RESEARCHING AS INTO HOW DO WE IMPLEMENT THIS RIGHT HOW TO HOW TO HOW TO ACQUIRE THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED -- YOU KNOW INCLUDING AS INCLUDED WITH OTHER UPDATES STORE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM [inaudible] GOT IT. AND THEN -- IT'S ONE ASKING WHETHER YOU KNOW THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATORS TO DOT PREPARE INVESTIGATIVE PLANS DOCUMENTING THEIR STRATEGIES AT THE OUTSIDE OF INVESTIGATIONS YOU KNOW SEEMS TO BE AN INDUSTRY STANDARD -- THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THE COUNCIL OF INSPECTOR GENERAL ON INTEGRITY AND EFFICIENCY BOTH RECOMMENDED. AT YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION -- MANUAL SEEMS TO RECOMMEND THE INVESTIGATIVE PLANS SO QUESTION IS IS -- IS A LACK OF OVERSIGHT IS LACK OF TRAINING WHY DON'T WE SEE THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. ADJUSTER COMMENTS ON THAT. I THINK -- I'D JUST LIKE -- TO GET TO THE END WHICH IS I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT WE IMPLEMENTED -- WHERE -- WERE WORKING ON THAT AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED SOON. THAT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED SINCE THE WILLSEE THAT AT THE CHECK IN. THAT WOULD DO YOU IMPLEMENTED SUED MEANS THE THE THE END OF THIS MONTH OR THESE. THE OCTOBER WHEN WE DO THE PROGRESS REPORT WE'LL SEE AT THAT. SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WILL BE IN THE IN THE PROGRESS REPORT THAT'S DUE IN TWELVE DAYS BUT MY MY MY ANTICIPATION IS IS THAT THAT WILL BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO. GOT IT AND JUST MY UNDERSTANDING FROM YOUR TESTIMONY EARLIER -- FOR THE BI CAMERAL WHEN WE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT THAT -- SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO IT -- WHERE TO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR TESTIMONY SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE NOT OPPOSED TO MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IF THAT'S WHERE THE LEGISLATURE? WHICH IS TO MOVE BUT YOUR LETTER AND RESPONSE SEEM TO BE CONTRADICTORY TO THAT IS THAT JUST A CHANGE OF DIRECTION AT THIS POINT. I THINK THAT MAYBE THE ANSWER IS MY LETTER WAS NOT WRITTEN AS WELL AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN -- AND WHAT I ATE INTENDED TO SEND THE LETTER AND WHAT I SAID EARLIER WAS -- IF THAT SOMETHING IF THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINES AND THE VOTERS DETERMINED THAT THE THAT THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE AMENDED THAT'S A POLICY. TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE VOTERS TO MAKE WHAT I SAID WAS THAT THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT STRUCTURE PROCESS AND I YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO BE SAID ABOUT IT AND YOU KNOW I DON'T -- WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A A SUPREME COURT ARGUMENT ABOUT IT BUT WE DO PROVIDE JUDGES WITH NOTICE WE PROVIDE THEM WITH PROCESS. AND THEY HAVE -- AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO KNOW THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM AND TO DEFEND THEMSELVES THAT'S WHAT DUE PROCESS REQUIRES AND WE PROVIDE DUE PROCESS NOW. GOT IT YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S EVERYBODY JUST WANTS ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY OBVIOUSLY DUE PROCESS FOR THE JUDGES AS WELL SO THAT THEY GET -- A FAIR SHAKE UP I BELIEVE SENATOR ALLEN HAD MENTIONED MAYBE EVEN PAYING SOME OF THE THE INVESTIGATORS BABY IF THAT HELPS THAT PROCESS BUT DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS. ON WHAT YOU THINK WOULD. HELP US IN THE GOAL OF REACHING. THE TRANSPARENCY THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THE PUBLIC DEMANDS BUT STILL BEING FAIR TO THE JUDGES -- MAYBE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WARRANT OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THE SO I DO THINK THAT OUR PROCESSES NOW ARE FAIR AND INAPPROPRIATE -- AT I'D SAY I'VE STE I SENT A COUPLE TIMES I JUST IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I DO THINK THAT -- YOU'LL WANT TO HEAR FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT INTERESTED PARTIES ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMISSION THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO STRUCTURE. A BICAMERAL A COMMISSION THAT ALL OF THE STATES THAT HOW THE QUOTE UNQUOTE BICAMERAL COMMISSION THEY DON'T ALL HAVE THE SAME CONTENT. NO NO STATE HAS THE STRUCTURE THAT THE ABA MODEL RULES RECOMMEND -- THE WHAT THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS IS NOT ENTIRELY IN LINE WITH WHAT THE ABA MODEL RULES RECOMMEND AND SO ALL I ALL I WANT TO SAY IS I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SYSTEM NOW AND I DO THINK IT COMPORTS. WITH THE PROCESS AND THE PROCESSES ARE GOOD. AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT STRUCTURE THAT THAT JUST BE CAREFULLY THOUGHT THROUGH SO THAT WE DON'T END UP WITH A SYSTEM THAT IS WORSE. GOT MORE EXPENSIVE RIGHT. CAN YOU JUST OUTLINED WHAT ARE SOME OF THOSE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE ABA MODEL. THAT'S NOT OUTLINED ARTS OF THE THINGS WE SHOULD CONSIDER KIND OF IF WE WERE TO MOVE DOWN THIS PATH BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ON THE BY CAN. POST SO -- IT JUST FOR STARTERS THE THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT -- THERE FOR THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY THAT THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY BE A MAJORITY OF THE LAY MEMBERS -- I I WILL NOTE THAT IN -- IN THE CURRENTLY THE WAY -- DISCIPLINE TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED THERE ARE GOVERNED BY THE RULES OF EVIDENCE -- SO THERE IS AN OPEN QUESTION IN MY MIND ABOUT HOW A MAJORITY OF LAY PEOPLE WOULD APPLY RULES OF EVIDENCE IN A TRIAL IN TERM WHAT THE ABA MODEL STRUCTURE RECOMMENDS IS THAT THERE BE ONE JUDGE ONE LAWYER AND ONE LAY PERSON -- AS A PART OF THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY WHICH IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS. THE A BE A MODEL RULE ALSO RECOMMENDS THAT FINAL DISCIPLINE BE IMPLEMENTED BY. THE BY STATE SUPREME COURTS -- THE CURRENT STRUCTURE IN THE ONE THE AUDIT REPORT RECOMMENDS IS THAT -- THE DISCIPLINE IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMMISSION BE -- BE YES -- SELF EXECUTING -- EAT AND THERE NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT GIVEN TO HOW -- HOW WOULD YOU TWO CASES? TO WORK ON ONE THING THAT -- MISTER HARRIS SAID WAS THAT WHAT THE DISCIPLINARY BODY WOULD DO. THE ONLY THING IT WOULD DO WOULD BE TO A PINE ON DISCIPLINE BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY RIGHT. THE THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUDICATE FACTS AND APPLY THE LAW AND THEN APPLY DISCIPLINE AND SO THAT IS A THAT IS A MORE SERIOUS ENDEAVOR AND THEN THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER -- EVERYTHING IF IF FOR THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE EVERY SINGLE JUDGE WHO IS ALLEGED TO HAVE COMMITTED MISCONDUCT -- NOW THE NOW THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT ALL CHARGES BE PUBLIC SO EVEN FOR LOW LEVEL MISCONDUCT ARE WE GOING TO NOW PUBLICLY CHARGE JUDGES WITH LOW LEVEL MISCONDUCT. AND EVEN IF THE LEVEL OF DISCIPLINE IS A PRIVATE ADMONISHMENT EVERYONE WILL KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE ARE CHARGES AND AND THE JUDGE HAS BEEN PUBLICLY CHARGE. I'M NOT ADVOCATING ONE WAY RIGHT I JUST THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WITH SOME JUDGES -- THEY GET PRIVATE DISCIPLINE THEY UNDERSTAND. AND THEY DON'T RE OFFEND AND THERE'S VALUE IN THE DISCIPLINE BEING PRIVATE DISCIPLINE. OKAY THANK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ALL THINGS THAT NEED TO HAVE A LONGER DISCUSSION A MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION AS IF THE LEGISLATURE MOVES INTO A LOOKING AT THIS BI CAMERAL A ARE -- CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GOT SOME OF YOUR THOUGHTS -- AS WELL AS WE PROBABLY CONTINUE THOSE DELIBERATIONS -- DID WANT TO ASK. ONE FINAL QUESTION PROBABLY. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW. TO ME THE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE EXAMPLE OF THE JUDGE WHERE THERE WAS COMPLAINTS OF HIS TRANSCRIPTS. NOTHING WAS DONE FOR YEARS AND THEN THE JUDGE ULTIMATELY STEPPED DOWN. WHAT COULD HAVE GOTTEN WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER? OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER. BUT NOW THE IN HINDSIGHT I KNOW IT'S MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY HINDSIGHT BUT HOW COULD WE HOW CAN WE IMPROVE THAT PROCESS SO THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. SO WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK -- FOR WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK FOR PATTERNS AND I DO THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE. IMPROVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IT MIGHT AT THE END MIGHT BE EQUALED. EASY TO TRACK. THINGS -- OUT AT OUT A DOLLAR DOWN A LEVEL I WOULD JUST LIKE TO ADD -- THAT -- THERE ARE -- OTHER MATTERS THAT WE HAVE WHERE. IT'S A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION -- WITH THE JUDGE THAT THE JUDGE WILL -- LEAVE THE BENCH AND AGREE NOT TO SERVICE A JUDICIAL OFFICER AGAIN AND WE THINK WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S BEEN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. THAT'S THAT IS -- SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC PROTECTION. I'M NOT SURE IT'S THE CASE THAT IN THE EXAMPLE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT THE JUDGE JUST DECIDED TO GO ON HIS OWN AYE AYE. AYE AYE READILY ASSUME THAT WAS A NEGOTIATED RESOLUTION. GOT IT. JUST ONE CASE PLEASE CENTER JUST A LAST COMMENT I LOOK AT THIS HEARING IS THE BEGINNING OF DISCUSSION SO I HOPE THAT. THIS WAGES SOME OF YOUR ANXIETY ALSO I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK TO WITH THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS I MEAN I I THINK THERE IS SOME CONCERN AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT PANEL ABOUT AT WHAT POINT. DO WE ENGAGE THE JUDGES WHO ARE THE SUBJECT OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS -- HOW EARLY IT IS MOST APPROPRIATE AND WHAT IS? THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO I THINK THOSE ARE ALSO PART TO THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE I SHOULD GO INTO WITH SOME GREATER LENGTH YOU KNOW THIS IS MORE AND SEE THIS IS MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND FOOTVIEW. BUT THERE ARE SOME LEGITIMATE CONCERN SHOULD I THINK THE LEGISLATURE. I CAN AND IN MAY VERY WELL TACKLE -- HOPEFULLY WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION ASSISTANCE IN DOING THAT. THANK YOU RIGHT WITH THAT LET ME ASK THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM THE PANEL ANYTHING ADDITIONALLY YOU'D LIKE TO ADD TO YOUR TESTIMONY. NO SIR ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE. TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER -- FOUR COMMENTS ON THE AUDIT REPORT WE HAVE A BRIDGET GRAMMY ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AND AND I PAUL. BUT SHE GLOBAL PRESIDENT OF BUT SHE GOT LUPO I LIKE IT NO ONE EVER PRESIDENT. THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU THANKS FOR JOINING US RIGHT. A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRIDGET GRAMMY. I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO LAW SCHOOL. AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE LAST PANEL SEVENTY FOR A CERTAIN STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER 75% OF LITIGANTS IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT ARE SELF REPRESENTED. AND I THINK THAT FACT ALONE. REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN THE JUDICIARY SYSTEM AND AND JUDGES ABILITY TO BEHAVE IN A IN A WAY THAT IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE SO I'D REALLY APPRECIATE. THESE COMMITTEES AND THEIR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER AND I ALSO WAS VERY ENCOURAGED BY THE LAST PANEL THAT THE COMMISSION IS TAKING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY -- SO AT THE JUST A BRIEF BACKGROUND -- WE SUBMITTED A LETTER WHICH HAS MORE DETAILS. DESCRIPTION ABOUT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE AUDIT AND SOME MORE SPECIFIC EXAMPLES SO I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME HIGHLIGHTS HERE AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU -- THE CENTER FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW IS BASED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO LAW SCHOOL AND WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT AND NONPARTISAN CENTER OF RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY. AND WHAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON FOR THE LAST ALMOST FORTY YEARS NOW SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY IS THE REGULATION OF BUSINESS PROFESSIONS AND TRADES AND CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND TAKE ITALY RECENTLY WITH THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE ALSO LOOK AT OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES SUCH AS THE MEDICAL BOARD THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD -- IT'S ADDRESS WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF REGULATING PROFESSIONALS. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS LONG RELIED ON OUR CENTER -- AND THE COURTS AS WELL FOR EXPERTISE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROFESSION REGULATION OF THE PROFESSIONS AND AS WITH AYE DETAILED IN IN MORE AND MORE DETAIL IN THE LETTER BUT ARE THEY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF OUR CENTER AND THE FOUNDER OF OUR CENTER PROFESSOR BOB SOME MATH. HE WAS APPOINTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO BE THE STATE BARS I DISCIPLINE MONITOR AND HE AND AND SEE PL STAFF DID SOME REALLY INTENSE STUDIES ELEVEN DIFFERENT REPORTS THAT THEY REPORTED BACK TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEES AND TO THE COURT. I'M WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON REFORMING THE DISCIPLINE SYSTEM AT THE STATE BAR -- INCLUDING LEGISLATION AND IMPOSE THE INDEPENDENT STATE PARK COURT SO WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THESE PARTICULAR ISSUES -- WEIRD STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT IT -- AND RATHER THAN RE HASH THE ONES THAT WERE ALSO PART OF THAT I JUST WANTED TO ADD IN THE U. DECISIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE HAVE BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND A WITH OTHER LICENSING AGENCIES AS WELL. SO THE FIRST ONE HAD TO DO WITH THE INVESTIGATIONS -- AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY THE INVESTIGATIONS AND WE WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATION THAT THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL -- SUPERVISOR SOMEBODY WHO IS -- SETTING SPECIFIC TIME FRAMES I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE SEE AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES LIKE THE MEDICAL BOARD THEY HAVE SPECIFIC DAYS. WHERE THEY AT LEAST TRY TO MEET SO THAT THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAPPEN WITHIN A CERTAIN EXPECTED TIME FRAME THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC PROTECTION IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING INVESTIGATED SO THAT THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT? AS WELL AS SPECIFIC PROCEDURES THAT SHOULD BE TAKING PLACE AT THE INVESTIGATIONS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE INVESTIGATORS ARE. GIVEN A LOT OF DISCRETION THAT THE WAY THAT IT'S CURRENTLY RUNNING RIGHT NOW. AND GIVEN THAT THE AUDITORS FOUND THAT -- THE COMMISSION AND ALMOST ALL CASES JUST ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE ATTORNEY WHO IS INVESTIGATING AT LEAST AT THE BEGINNING STAGES WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT. AND CLOSING THE COMPLAINT WITHOUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION I THINK THEY ONLY. FOR ELEVEN INSTANCES WHERE THE COMMISSION DISAGREED WITH THE ATTORNEYS DECISION TO NOT TO CONTENT OR TO CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION OUT OF LIKE -- SIX THOUSAND AND REMEMBER THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT IT WAS A VERY VERY TINY PERCENTAGE. SO THAT JUST DEMONSTRATE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING -- GOOD PROCEDURES AND AND REALLY WELL TRAINED INVESTIGATORS SOMEBODY WHO'S SUPERVISED. WHO COULD SUPERVISE THE INVESTIGATORS AND ALSO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW IF THE INVESTIGATION IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS PROCESS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT IS A CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE BIRD AND THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET? AND SO -- THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION WITH RESPECT TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC THAN WHAT WAS LAID OUT IN THE I'D IT. HAS TO DO WITH THE TRAINING AND THE INVESTIGATORS ON THE FACT THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE. ATTORNEYS ALONE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY'RE TRAINED AND HOW TO YOU AND DO A QUALITY INVESTIGATION AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE. SO AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS VERY SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR THAT INVESTIGATORS WE THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THE RECOMMENDATION [inaudible] AND I SOMETHING THAT WASN'T FOCUSED ON TOO MUCH -- IN THE PRIOR PANELS THAT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON IS THE FACT. OUT THE SPECIAL MASTERS -- AND THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY DON'T. THAT THE SPECIAL MASTER SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THIS PROCESS -- AND AND WE WE REALLY SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE JUDGES THEMSELVES AND IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS AS A PART AS A PERCEPTION OF THE PUBLIC -- WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING BIG THERE CAN DEFINITELY BE A PERCEPTION THAT JUDGES WHO ARE JUDGING THEIR OWN PEERS THEY HAVE A TENDENCY EVEN AND EVEN SUBCONSCIOUSLY. TO GIVE MORE LENIENT AND DISCIPLINE RECOMMENDATIONS FAN THEN THEY MAY BE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MIGHT. AND I BELIEVE THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT IN THE CASES WHERE THE COMMISSION DIFFERED FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SPECIAL MASTER THE COMMISSION WHO HAS PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE COMMISSION. IN EVERY INSTANCE VOTED TO ELEVATE THE RECOMMENDED LEVEL OF DISCIPLINES I THINK THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. WE HIGHLIGHTED HERE -- WITH RESPECT TO THE CONCERN THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE REYES WITH HAVING PUBLIC MEMBERS INVOLVED IN BEING YOU KNOW AND EDUCATING THESE CASES. THIS THIS IS WHERE IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE WAY THAT OTHER STATE AGENCIES RYAN. AND I HAD WE'VE KIND OF SPECIFIED. IS AND I WILL GO THROUGH THE WHOLE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT FOR YOU RIGHT NOW. BUT I DO WITH WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT HOW TO RUN THIS I CAN TELL YOU THAT -- FOR EXAMPLE WHAT THE MEDICAL BOARD THE BOARD DOES MAKE THE DECISIONS -- AS FAR AS THE DISCIPLINE AT THE END OF THE DAY IN THE MEDICAL BOARD IS MADE UP OF PUBLIC MEMBERS AND POSITION MEMBERS -- THAT THE WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE I THINK IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN INDEPENDENCE AND EXPERTISE SO IF YOU HAVE ONLY JUDGES MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THE WAY THAT JUDGES SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T BEHAVE. YOU MAY HAVE THE EXPERTISE BUT YOU'RE LACKING THE INDEPENDENCE FROM THE PUBLIC STANDPOINT AS FAR AS WHAT IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE AND SO YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE AND AS YOU'RE PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS FORWARD. THAT THERE SHOULD BE THIS BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT AND THAT REALLY CAN BE DONE. ON THE OTHER THING THAT WE WE POINTED OUT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT BOARD SUCH AS THE MEDICAL BOARD HAVE DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES. THAT THEY GO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS TO ADOPT. AND AND THAT GUIDELINE AGAIN BOTH FOR THE JUDGES WHO WOULD BE UNDER INVESTIGATION AND THE POTENTIAL DISCIPLINE AS WELL AS FOR THE PUBLIC IT REALLY. MAKES IT MORE CLEAR WHAT WHICH TYPES OF VIOLATIONS OF WILL YOU KNOW. WHICH TYPES OF DISCIPLINE AND NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADOPTED IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS. AND SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT. WE DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT THE THE COMMISSION CONSIDER -- AND AND WE ALSO REALLY DO RECOMMEND THIS BI CAMERAL RECOMMENDATION FOR THE TRUCTURE IT'S AN WE ARE WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER GENCY IN CALIFORNIA FOR SURE THAT HAS THIS UNITARY STRUCTURE. USUALLY THE THAT REALLY THE BOARD WHO IS MAKING A FINAL DECISION ABOUT DISCIPLINE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION AT ALL ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING KIND OF ALLEGATIONS WERE MADE AT THE BEGINNING. WHETHER IT'S JUST EVEN IF IT COULD SUB CONSCIOUS THOSE DOES FACTS ARE AND AND THE HEADS OF THE ULTIMATE DECISION MAKERS AND SO IT'S A IT'S A MUCH. MORE FAIR PROCESS FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED TO HAVE A SEPARATE STRUCTURE. U. S. SUPPORT THAT RECOMMENDATION -- AND THEN JUST LASTLY WE I I HAVE SPECIFIED SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TRANSPARENCY ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY MEASURES IN MY LETTER -- AND WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATE BAR OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY'VE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL OF THESE INCLUDING. WEBCASTING EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO YOU AND THE SAME ROLES OF ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT THAT THE REST OF THAT. BRENT AGENCIES ARE SUBJECT -- TO HAVING A PROCESS WHERE YOUR POST THEY WOULD BE POSTING THEIR PROPOSED RULE CHANGES ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING THE HEARING IS WEBCAST -- THEY HAVE AN EMAIL SUBSCRIPTION ON THEIR WEBSITE WHERE YOU PEOPLE CAN SIGN UP AND SAY I WANT TO GET MORE INFORMATION I WANT TO BE NOTIFIED ANY TIME THAT -- FOR INSTANCE THE COMMISSION IS HAVING A PUBLIC HEARING ALL OF THESE MEASURES -- ARE NOT VERY EXPENSIVE THEY'RE NOT THAT OWNERS AND THEY REALLY EMPLOYMENT. GOOD POLICIES SO THAT THE PUBLIC CAN BE MORE INVOLVED AND AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND PRESERVING THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. SO -- I'M WITH THAT I'LL I'M JUST HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE END. THANK YOU IN A PREVIOUS THAT IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS LET'S GO TO MOVE ON THANK YOU THANK YOU -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS WELCOME. TO RESHAPE AND ALSO -- WELCOME TO THE A CO PANELISTS. INTO THE PUBLIC MEMBERS HERE HERE'S WELL -- MY NAME IS PAUL BY CHECK A LOOP ON I HAVE BEEN A JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF LOS ANGELES FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS. AND I AM THE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION. CGA IS THE LARGEST VOLUNTARY JUDICIAL ASSOCIATION IN THE COUNTRY WITH TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MEMBERS WHO ARE ACTIVE AND RETIRED. JUSTICES IN. SIR THANK YOU FOR INVITING. CJ TO PARTICIPATE TODAY IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I AM A SPECIAL MASTER WITH THE C. JP. AND I STARTED MY JUDICIAL CAREER NINETEEN YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SENATOR BOB HERTZBERG. APPOINTING ME AS A JUDGE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR COURT. AND I I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING ON THAT COURT FOR TWO YEARS. AND I ALSO WAS -- THE FOUNDING SUPERVISOR AND PARTICIPATED IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE HIS DISCIPLINE PROGRAM. WHICH ADDRESSES -- SUBSIDY USE A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR ATTORNEYS WHO STRUGGLE WITH THAT -- IN SENATOR JACKSON IS A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU TODAY AND SERVE WITH YOU ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT ON IMPORTANT MATTERS PERTAINING TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO FOUR MAJOR THEMES TODAY MAINLY. ONE EMPHASIZING THE MAINTENANCE AND EXPANSION OF DUE PROCESS RIGHTS FOR JUSTICES JUDGES AND COMMISSIONERS. WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE SYSTEM? TO THE PRESERVATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY. IN DISCIPLINE PROCEEDINGS THREE TYPES OF DISCIPLINE IMPOSED INCLUDING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS. IN FOR A C. J. P. REORGANIZATION. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM FOR ITS WORK. MAKE NO MISTAKE ALL OF THE JUSTICES AND BENCH OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA FULLY SUPPORT THE CJ PEAS FUNDAMENTAL MISSION WHICH INCLUDES THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC -- AND WHILE. HAVE A THE PANELISTS HAS MENTIONED THE STRUCTURE OF OTHER DISCIPLINARY BODIES FOR PROFESSIONALS AND OTHERS. LET'S NOT LOSE SIGHT THAT EVERY BENCH OFFICER IN CALIFORNIA IS A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER. EACH AND EVERYONE OF US HAS TAKEN AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONS UNLIKE. EXECUTIVE BRANCH EMPLOYEES PROFESSIONALS IN OTHER GOVERNMENT WORKERS AS MENTIONED EXCEPT LAWYERS ONLY JUDGES ARE GOVERNED BY A CODE OF ETHICS. UNDERSTANDING THE INTRICACIES OF ETHICAL RULES IS SOMETIMES A COMPLEX UNDERTAKING. I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIAL CONDUCT HANDBOOK IS OVER NINE HUNDRED PAGES. ALL P MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY BENCH OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA APPRECIATE THAT THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF OUR WORK. IS TO ENSURE INTEGRITY IN HONEST HONESTY IN DECISION MAKING. A SOMETIMES MOST DIFFICULT IN SUBTLE TASK WHILE SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO COMPLEX ISSUES. WHAT CAN GET LOST IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WORK THAT JUDGES DO IS THE FACT THAT MANY ASSIGNMENTS?% LIKE CONFIDENTIAL DEPENDENCY IN FAMILY LAW PROCEEDINGS. INHERENTLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO EVOKE STRONG EMOTIONAL REACTIONS FROM PARTIES WHO ARE UNHAPPY WITH THE LEGALLY SOUND AN ETHICAL OUTCOMES. SOMETIMES THAT UPSET IS TURNED ON JUDGES WITH FALSE AND MISLEADING CRITICISM AND PERSONAL ATTACKS. PUBLIC COMPLAINTS ARE TYPICALLY FILED WITH THE COURT -- LOCAL LEADERSHIP FOR INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS THE C. JP. THE SUPERVISING JUDGES IN OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THOROUGHLY REVIEW ALL COMPLAINTS. NO ONE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC IS DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND AS YOU TO THE C. J. P.. R. MERITLESS. SOME PEOPLE WONDER. A JUDGE RESPOND TO AND JUST TO TAX. WE CAN'T. THE CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS PROHIBIT A JUDGE FROM COMMENTING ON AN OPEN CASE. ALTHOUGH THE STATISTICS BEAR OUT. THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF COMPLAINTS SUBMITTED TO THE C. J. P. ARE INVESTIGATED AND DISPOSED OF AND ARE MERITLESS. THE ATTACKS AGAINST JUDGES PERSIST ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WITHIN THE PRESS. PLEASE BE MINDFUL ABOUT THE PERSPECTIVE OF A JUDGE WHO PURSUES THIS WONDERFUL AND NOBLE PROFESSION. WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT MAINTAINING TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE COURTS IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE. AT THE SAME TIME. JUDGING. IS A STRESSFUL PARTICULARLY IN THE FACE OF CHRONIC INCIVILITY. WHERE INDIVIDUALS ARE RUDE DISRESPECTFUL? BELITTLING OTHERS SPEAKING IN A CONDESCENDING AND HURTFUL MANNER. AND BRINGING ON MANAGED PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL CRISIS IS INTO THE COURT ROOM. MANY JUDGES FEEL THE DAILY STRESS OF HEAVY DOCKETS WEIGHTY DECISIONS. REPEATED EXPOSURE TO DISTURBING EVIDENCE AND TRAUMATIZED PARTIES AND VICTIMS. ON TOP OF FALSE AND MISLEADING PUBLIC ATTACKS IN THREAD OF RE. ELECTION CHALLENGE. OUR COURT ROOMS ARE AT THE INTERSECTION OF SOCIETY SERIOUS PROBLEMS. LIKE HOMELESSNESS. OPIATES AN ALCOHOL ADDICTION MENTAL HEALTH THE SUICIDE CRISIS. GANG VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT. IN FAMILIES IN CRISIS. FURTHERMORE THE LEGISLATURE IN SOCIETY OR ASKING JUDGES TO PLAY A MORE COMPLEX ROLE THAN THE TRADITIONAL A JUDY KERRY FUNCTION. JUDGES ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. RUNNING MENTAL HEALTH VETERANS AND DRUG AND ALCOHOL COURSE. WE COLLABORATE WITH JUSTICE PARTNERS THE COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS. WE ARE ASKED TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES IN OUR DECISION MAKING. WHILE SOCIETY IS CHANGING SO IS THE ROLE AND FUNCTION A JUDGE PLACE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT JUSTICE IS A BENCH OFFICERS SPENT THOUSANDS OF HOURS VOLUNTEERING. IN COMMUNITY AND CIVIC OUTRAGE TO HELP OR USE IN MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. AND SPEAK ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT JUDGES ARE COMMITTED TO MANDATORY EDUCATION. SO THAT WE ARE BETTER AWARE OF OUR IMPLICIT BIAS. IN MINDFUL THAT OUR CONDUCT IN PRIVATE IN PUBLIC LIFE FULFILLS THE ROLE TO MAINTAIN AN INDEPENDENT IMPARTIAL AND HONORABLE JUDICIARY. WE ASK OURSELVES. DID I CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALLOW THE INTRUSION OF INSIDIOUS BIAS TO COMMAND. DID I ALLOW THE PRESS OF BUSINESS TO TRANSCEND JUSTICE. HAVE I PRETENDED TO HEAR. WHEN IN FACT I DID NOT LISTEN? HAVE I ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPINION YOUR PRESSURE. REACHING DECISIONS TO FAVOR ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER. OR PLEASE THE POWERFUL. JUDGES ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN YOUR NEIGHBORS WHO CONSCIENTIOUSLY STRIVE EVERY DAY. TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE EQUITABLY IN FAIRLY. I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT THE AUDIT DOES NOT ELABORATE THE JUDGES WHO ARE DUTY BOUND TO PROTECT AND BALANCE. THE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS OF ALL WHO APPEARED IN OUR COURTS. RIGHTLY EXPECT THE SAME WITH RAMOS INTERACT WITH TO SEE JP. LET ME REFER YOU TO QUESTIONS THREE INFORM THE AUDIT WHICH ADDRESS WHEN JUDGES ARE CONTACTED ABOUT A COMPLAINT. IN WHAT INFORMATION DOES SEE JP PROVIDE JUDGES. THE CURRENT CJ POOL THE ROLE PROVIDE. THE SHARING OF DISCOVERY ONLY AFTER WRITTEN NOTICE OF FORMAL PROCEEDINGS BE ISSUED. CONSEQUENTLY JUDGES DO NOT DEVELOP COMPLETELY EXCULPATORY IN MITIGATING EVIDENCE IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST THE JUDGE. NOR OR JUDGES INTERVIEWED EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS PART OF ITS INVESTIGATION WHICH COULD BE PART OF THE INITIAL STEPS OF AN INVESTIGATION. JUDGES DO SUPPORT THE COMPLAINTS BE ASSESSED AND INVESTIGATED. BUT EXIT THE PROCESS PROCEED WITHIN A TIME FRAME IT'S FAIR TO THE JUDGE AS WELL AS THE COMPLAINT. A PRE FILING PHASE IN THE PROCESS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE C. J. P. AND THE JUDGE IN ALL BECAUSE IT CAN LEAD. TO RESTORATIVE PRO APPROACH OR PROVIDE FOR THERAPEUTIC PLAN OR OTHER CORRECTIVE MEASURES ALL SHORT OF DISCIPLINE. IN FACT. THE AUDITOR GIVES A NOD TO THE GROUND BREAKING SEE JP MENTORING PROGRAM. CGA COMMENCED THIS SEE JP FOR THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TOWARDS REMEDIAL JUSTICE. JUDGES ARE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PRESERVING IN AND MADE MAINTAINING CAUGHT. ALLERGY IN THESE CASES. AS THE STATISTICS BEAR OUT MOST COMPLAINTS ARE DISMISSED BUT IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE A COMPLAINT MOVES FORWARD. THE CONSEQUENCES OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE WITHOUT A COMPLETE ADJUDICATION OF THE FAX. CAN HAVE DEVASTATING ADVERSE PUBLICITY. AND LEAD TO UNFAIR CRITICISM AND FALSE CLAIMS AND RESULT IN THE POLITICIZATION OF ELECTORAL CHALLENGES TO JUDGE BASED UPON AN INCOMPLETE FACTUAL RECORD. THE PRESERVATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS FOR ALL INVOLVED. CJ SUPPORTS THE AUDITOR TO IMPLEMENT. ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE MEASURES IN LIEU OF DISCIPLINE. SUCH AS ANGER MANAGEMENT. THERAPEUTIC COUNSELING AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERVENTION THAT HELP REHABILITATE BEHAVIOR. THE RECENTLY INITIATED MENTORING PROGRAM IS A TERRIFIC SHOT A START CGA ENCOURAGES THE C. J. P. TO CONTEMPLATE IN ADOPT OTHER CORRECTIVE MEASURES THAT ARE NOT DEEMED DISCIPLINE. IN STILL SERVE THE PURPOSE OF PRINT PUBLIC PROTECTION. CJ WOULD BE PLEASED TO WORK WITH A C. SHAPING ON HAND SAYING SUCH MEASURES. LASTLY THE AUDIT RECOMMENDS REORGANIZATION AND RESTART. THE CGPA. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THE VOTERS A CALIFORNIA IN APPROVED A MAJOR REFORMULATION OF THIS CGP AND ESTABLISH A SYSTEM WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSIONERS ARE PUBLIC MEMBERS. THEY HAVE A SUPER MAJORITY. ONLY THREE OF ELEVEN MEMBERS ARE JUDGES. THE VOTERS INTENDED IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR THAT HAVING THE VOICES OF JUDGES UNDERSEA JP. IS CRITICAL. TOWARDS ENSURING FAIRNESS. JUDGES ARE ALWAYS BOUND BY THE CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS INCLUDING SERVING IN THEIR FUNCTION. AS MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. FOR SPECIAL MASTERS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD IN THAT IS THAT. SPECIAL MASTERS DO NOT IMPOSE DISCIPLINE. THAT IS THE ROLE AND FUNCTION OF THE COMMISSION. THE SPECIAL MASTERS CONDUCT FINDINGS OF FACT AND MAKE CONCLUSIONS OF LAW. THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS UPON DISCIPLINE. AND I MIGHT FURTHER AT THAT LAST YEAR THERE WERE TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS ONLY TWO INSTANCES OUT OF ALL OF THESE CASES WHERE THERE IN FACT WAS A PUBLIC HEARING. AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE RATIO THAT SPEND GOING. FOR THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER THE YEARS. ONE OR TWO CASES IN A YEAR WHERE THERE'S A A FORMAL HEARING IN WHICH IS SPECIAL MASTERS AND FALL. CGA URGES YOU. TO NOT ACT. IN HASTE BUT CONDUCTED DEEP THOUGHTFUL AND DELIBERATE OF ANALYSIS AND EXAMINATION. OF THE RESTRUCTURING RECOMMENDATIONS. IN CONCLUSION THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TO YOU I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE NOW. AND WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND MAYBE WE'LL JUST BEGIN RIGHT THEIR COLLEGE WANT TO GET THAT CLARIFICATION SO SPECIAL MASTERS BECAUSE THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT ONE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE INVOLVED THAT THERE'S OBVIOUSLY MORE LENIENCY. TWO OTHER JUDGES. BUT YOU'RE SAYING. NO ENFORCEMENT ACTION IS ACTUALLY PASSED IT STEP BY THE WHOLE COMMISSION. AND IT'S A WAITED COMMISSION WHERE. I BELIEVE THERE'S THREE SPECIAL MASTERS ON THE COMMISSION IS THAT CORRECT YES. RIGHT. SO I'D WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT POINT WAS CLEAR SO THEN. YEAH I'M WILL ALSO ADD THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS. ARE -- SELECTED INTERPRET. BY -- THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. AND THAT THE SPECIAL MASTERS -- PARTICIPATE IN EXTENSIVE. TRAINING -- WITH REGARDS TO THE RULES AND PROCEDURES OF THE C. JP. THEY ARE THOROUGHLY EDUCATED ABOUT -- THE LAW AND THEY CONSCIENTIOUSLY AND DELIVER TAILORED LITERALLY -- CONDUCT THE HEARINGS ALL OF WHICH ARE IN IN PUBLIC. AT WHICH TIME -- TESTIMONIES RECEIVED AND THEY THEY THEN CONCLUDE WITH THEIR FINDINGS OF FACT. AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW CUT WITH RESPECT TO VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS THANK YOU. AND SO. YOU SAY THAT'S ALL DONE IN PUBLIC YES THIS COMMENTER LAWYER ABOUT BABY WEBCASTING THAT ARE IT'S NOT A SET DAY. OUR THERE'S LITTLE THERE'S PUBLIC NOTICE OF THESE PUBLIC LETTERS. THE PUBLIC IS PRESIDENT THE PRESSES PRESIDENT THERE -- CONDUCTED AND IN WITH -- FULL TRANSPARENCY. GOT IT THANK YOU LET'S MOVE SENATE JACKSON YES THANK YOU AND CAN THANK YOU FOR MINDING US THE THE ROLE OF JUDGES. WHEN I PRACTICED LAW IT WAS ALWAYS VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN I HAD TO WAIT? A PRO PER LITIGANT. TO CONCLUDE THEIR APPEARANCE UP FREQUENTLY THE JUDGES WOULD END UP HAVING TO EXPLAIN WHAT RULES OF EVIDENCE ARE -- IT'S REALLY -- I THINK A VERY CHALLENGING POSITION TO BE AND CERTAINLY IS AN ATTORNEY WAITING. TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT TO WAS PAYING ME FOR MY TIME -- WHILE WAITING FOR A A COURT TO HAVE TO EDUCATE. A LITIGANTS ON WHAT. JUDICIAL PROCESS SHE IS -- CAN BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A LARGE A CALENDAR OF CASES BEFORE YOU I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY -- MIGHT PERCEIVE THAT COURTS GET IMPATIENT AND FRANKLY THEY PROBABLY DO -- AND THEY ARE. YOU KNOW HUMAN BEINGS AND FOR ALL SUBJECT TO THE VAGARIES OF OUR HUMANITY -- WHICH BRINGS ME TO A POINT I IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. ONE OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS HERE IS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY RISE TO A LEVEL. OF DISCIPLINE. I DON'T THINK WE'RE EVER GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATE EVERY CASE -- AND I THINK THAT THE MAJOR. HAVE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE USUALLY IN PARTICULARLY EGREGIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES -- MOST OF THE SITUATIONS I EITHER GET RESOLVED OR COULD BE RESOLVED IT SEEMS TO ME. WITH EARLY INTERVENTION IF YOU WILL THAT THERE ARE FOR EXAMPLE CONCERNS -- BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- THAT A JUDGE'S BEHAVIOR IS INAPPROPRIATE AGAIN I MENTION THAT ONE CIRCUMSTANCES. I RECALL WERE JUDGE BETWEEN ELEVEN THIRTY AND TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING -- WAS ACTUALLY ON IMPOSSIBLE -- AND IT TURNED OUT IT'S BECAUSE HE HAD VERY LOW BLOOD SUGAR WAS I THINK WAS DIABETIC IT'S MANY MANY YEARS AGO HE'S LONG DECEASED. BUT IF SOMEONE HAD INTERVENED EARLY AND SAY THEIR COMPLAINTS JUST GRAB A SANDWICH ELEVEN O'CLOCK I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE A TAKING CARE OF A PART OF THE THE PROBLEM NOW NOT ALL THE SITUATIONS ARE THAT EASY TO RESOLVE BUT I'M WONDERING -- AT IF YOU COULD TO AND PERHAPS SOMEONE. OTHER THAN THE JUDGE IF THEY KNOW BETTER -- IS THERE A PROCESS NOW. WHERE WE CAN HAVE THAT EARLIER INTERVENTION -- IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDS IN IN HER REPORT. OFTENTIMES EARLY INTERVENTION SAVES A LOT OF GRIEF OF FOR THE LITIGANTS FOR THE JUDGE FOR THE JUDGES -- STAFF I CHOSE BEING MADE AWARE. AND THE FACT THAT THE BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT -- THERE HAVE TO BE CHANGES MADE AND WHETHER THERE CAN BE TWO ADDITIONAL TRAINING -- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS ON THE TABLE HERE RIGHT NOW. WE COULD WE DO SHOULD DO MORE. TO TO CREATE THAT I KNOW -- THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE COURT OF A TRIES TO DO THAT THE STATE BAR NOW WE DO WE TRY TO HAVE PROGRAMS ON DIFFERENT KINDS OF BEHAVIORAL TRAINING. ABOUT THE CPAP BEING A UNIQUE CREATURE IS THAT IS THAT -- OPPORTUNITY AVAILABLE UNDER THE CURRENT LAW OR IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT HAS TO GET CHANGED THROUGH A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE MICHAEL PANELS TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE -- FROM THE JUDGE'S PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THIS AND MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS -- JUDGES -- PRACTICING. THOUGHTFUL DEEP SELF AWARENESS. AND THAT IS CRITICAL ABOUT HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT -- WHAT IS GOING ON WITH -- YOURSELF AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT. SO THAT YOU CAN PRACTICE THE THE DEGREE OF PATIENCE IS THAT'S APPROPRIATE. IN EVERY SINGLE CASE SO THAT YOU CAN -- MAKE SURE THAT -- THE MAJORITY OF CASES THAT WE HAVE WHO ARE SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS -- FEEL THAT THAT THAT THEY HAVE -- HAD THE DUE PROCESS THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO SO THE QUESTION THEN IS IS THE ARE THE TOOLS TO IT FOR A JUDGE TO ENGAGE AND THOUGHTFUL SHOP WORKERS. ARE THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IF WE WERE GOING TO SAY AS WE FOCUS ON THE CGP AS WE FOCUS ON JUDICIAL CONDUCT. LET'S TRY TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE LIKELY TO BE SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT ARISE GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT. SUCH A 75% OF THE LITIGANTS ARE ARE SELF REPRESENTED AND DON'T KNOW THE RULES OF EVIDENCE AND DON'T KNOW CIVILITY IN A COURT ROOM MORE WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ARE THOSE PROGRAMS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND IF SO WHO PROMOTE. PROVIDES THEM THE CGA HAS A ROBUST EDUCATION PROGRAM WHERE WE CONDUCT CONFERENCES WE HAVE WEAPON ARE. A LOT OF OF OUTREACH AND TRAINING IN A LOCAL COURTS ARE DOING THIS IN INDIVIDUAL COURTS ARE ALSO DOING THIS IN AN INFORMAL WAY. SO THAT THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES TO DO THAT FURTHERMORE. THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL -- EDUCATION WHICH IS -- JUDICIAL COUNCIL DIVISION THEY HAVE A ROBUST EDUCATION COMPONENT. THAT ADDRESSES EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SO THERE IS A LOT OF ROBUST EDUCATION ON THIS. DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FROM THE C. K. PLEASE [inaudible] ONE YOUR HERE AGAIN I I DON'T KNOW WHETHER CHAIRED BY MY COLLEAGUES BUT I STILL BELIEVE AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE AND AND I ALSO DO KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE. THOROUGHLY INEFFECTIVE -- SO IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF COMPLETION OF MY COMPLAINTS THAT COME BEFORE GOING TO CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR WITHIN THE COURTROOM -- SO THAT LITIGANTS FEEL THAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARD IN MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT'S WHAT LITIGANTS WANT. EVEN IF YOU DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THEM THEY WANT THEIR DAY IN COURT THEY WANT TO BE HEARD THEY WANT TO BE RESPECTED -- WHAT IS AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN ASSURE THAT THE? INJUSTICE THAT THE PUBLIC SEES IS A CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS. SO IT THIS AYE AYE HERE'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION TO BE WAS WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY -- TO ORDER -- NON DISCIPLINARY -- BUT EDUCATION ROLE OR THINGS THAT WOULD HELP JUDGES IMPROVE THE COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT -- THE WHAT THE COMMISSION CAN DO IS DEFINED IN THE CONSTITUTION THE COMMISSION DOES NOT NOW HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO ORDER JUDGES TO UNDERGO EDUCATION OR ANGER MANAGEMENT OR OR SEEK A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT -- AND HAVE THAT BE -- NON DISCIPLINARY SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE COMMISSION'S AUTHORITY THANK YOU. LET ME ASK JUST ON THAT. BECAUSE I'M NOT VERY FAMILIAR. IZZARD OPPORTUNITY FOR A JUDGE I HAVE HAD ACCESS. CONDUCT COMPLAINTS AND WHERE DOES THAT PUT BE IN RELATION TO MY PEERS. AND SAY THE COUNTY OR ACROSS THE STATE -- IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR JUDGE TO EVEN GET THAT FEEDBACK IS MISERY YEARLY REVIEW OR SOMETHING WHERE. SOMEONE CAN TELL THE JUDGE. THE COMPLAINTS FOR YOUR HERE THE AVERAGES HERE MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND GO -- TO OF THESE EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND WHAT NOT. THERE'S NOTHING -- SPECIFICALLY LIKE THAT BUT THE COMMISSION DOES HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT AND IN THE ANNUAL REPORT. THERE ARE -- THERE ARE FULSOME SUMMARIES OF PUBLIC DISCIPLINE. AND THERE ARE A BRIEF SUMMARIES OF OF CONFIDENTIAL DISCIPLINE SO THEY HAVE TO BE BRIEF BECAUSE BECAUSE THE DISCIPLINE WAS CONFIDENTIAL BUT THERE IS ENOUGH INFORMATION IN THERE. FOR A JUDGE TO SEE -- WHAT CONDUCT THAT WARRANTED DISCIPLINE WE ALSO HAVE A ROBUST INFORMATION ABOUT -- PRIOR DISCIPLINE ON OUR WEBSITE BUT WE HAVE BEEN IN ORDER PORT EVERY YEAR AND WE SEND IT TO EVERY SINGLE JUDGE IN THE STATE AS WELL AS YOU ALL MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT THAT. JUDGES HAVE THE ETHICAL OBLIGATION TO SELF REPORT. AND THERE MAY BE SOME -- THE APPEARANCE OF THE ETHICAL TRANSGRESSION. SO WE HAVE THE OBLIGATION AND WE DO THAT. AND SECOND WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER OF HOW WE MIGHT -- PER TO ENHANCE AND BOLSTER -- EDUCATIONAL. REMEDIATION AND AND THINGS OF THAT SORT SHORT OF DISCIPLINE IF THAT'S NOT WITHIN THE STATUTORY PURVIEW OR CONSTITUTIONAL PURVIEW OF THE COMMISSION AS IT STANDS NOW. I CAN TELL YOU THAT. MANY JUDGES WHO FEEL THAT THE STRESS OF THAT PARTICULAR ASSIGNMENT IS NOT WELL SUITED FOR THEM. ASKED TO BE REASSIGNED AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF SUPERVISION OVERSIGHT OVER THE CONDUCT BEHAVIOR OF JUDGES BECAUSE AT THE FRONT LINE. THE COURTS ARE CONSTANTLY RECEIVING FEEDBACK AND INPUT -- FROM LITIGANTS FROM ATTORNEYS FROM STAFF MEMBERS WITH RESPECT -- TO WHAT'S TRANSPIRING IN THE COURT ROOM. AND SO THERE IS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION BEFORE IT GETS AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL AND WE DO -- WE DO THAT KIND OF THING UP AND DOWN THE STATE. WATER AND WITH THAT THE THE PRESIDING I'M SORRY AS OF THE SUPERVISING JUDGE SUPERVISING JUDGE JUDGE HERE IN THE SYSTEM TO IN SOME CAPACITY RIGHT GOT IT WORK IT'S TELLING. TO ANOTHER COLLEAGUE WHO MAY BE A SENIOR JUDICIAL OFFICER TO ASSIST AND AND HELP OUT IN A YOU COULD SAY IN A MENTORING FASHION THAT WE HAVE. ESTABLISHED INFORMALLY WITHIN OUR OWN COURTS. I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM THOUGH IS THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE MORE EARNEST AND MORE EFFECTIVE. IN THOSE PROCEDURES AND AS I LOOK BACK -- I A NUMBER OF THE IN PLAIN SAID THAT I HEARD AND FELT MYSELF WHEN I WAS PRACTICING WHICH SHALL BE IT IS A LONG TIME AGO. IS SOME OF THE IMPLICIT BIAS. GENDER BASED BIAS RACIALLY BASED BIAS -- AND THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT -- REALLY DO UNDERMINE -- THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF THE COURTS AND SO -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST AND EFFECTIVE PROGRAM. A TO ADDRESS IMPLICIT BIAS -- TO ADDRESS THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THAT. RESULTS IN THE PUBLIC BELIEVING THAT A PARTICULAR JUDGE. IS -- BIASED AGAINST CERTAIN LITIGANTS -- BECAUSE PUT PART OF THE MY CONCERN TO IS A JUDGE'S BECOME OF WE HAVE AN ELECTED JUDICIAL PROCESS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I WANT YOUR JUST TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO GET REELECTED OR WHETHER OR NOT THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE IS GONNA PUBLICLY -- CHALLENGE THEM -- SO THAT THEY ARE AFRAID TO DO WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOBS OR THESE ARE JUST PEOPLE. AND WHEN WE SEE THIS HAPPEN. THE QUESTION TO ME IS COULD WE HAVE -- COULD WE HAVE INTERVENED BEFORE WE GOT TO THAT LEVEL BECAUSE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THE JUDICIARY IS CRITICAL IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE COURT A COURT SYSTEM THAT FUNCTIONS AS SHE WILL NOW SO. I CAN SAY THAT CJ'S MINDFUL OF AB -- TWO FORTY TWO WHICH IT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO BROADEN -- EDUCATION -- FOR LEGAL PROFESSIONALS AND FOR JUDGES AND IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY -- CGA HAD A HAD A MEETING WITH -- OUR TASK FORCE ON GENDER RACIAL AND ETHNIC FAIRNESS IN THE COURTS AND SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN PLANNING AND DEVELOPING. MORE ROBUST -- TREATING IN EDUCATION ON IMPLICIT BIASES ADDITIONALLY THE CHIEF JUSTICE -- HAS SET CREATED A TASK. FOR AND HARASSMENT -- AND ITS RECOMMENDATIONS WILL SOON BE COMING OUT IN JULY -- WHICH WILL CONTAIN A NUMBER OF OF EDUCATIONAL -- IDEAS THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT SO MY LAST QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY WAY FOR THE C. J. P. TO BE WORKING WITH THE CGA OR THE COURT SO THE CHIEF FOR ANY OF THE OTHER -- COURT FOCUSED ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST AND COMPETENT -- EDUCATIONAL PROCESS AND OTHER REMEDIAL. EFFORTS TO INTERVENE AT AN EARLIER STAGE SO THAT WE DON'T END UP. WITH -- HAVING TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS WITH SPECIAL MASTERS WITH WHAT HAVE YOU THAT THAT WE CAN DO EARLY INTERVENTION THE JUDGES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY NECESSARILY ABOUT. WHETHER WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS GOING TO RESULT IN THEM. LOSING THEIR JOBS I MEAN. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE TRYING THAT ARE DESIGNED TO TRY TO REACH THE SAME GOAL. IS THERE ANY INTERACTION OR IT IS A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO EXCLUDE THAT KIND OF INTERACTION MAYBE THIS QUESTIONS AS ARE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AS YOU POINTED OUT -- I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING -- MISTER DRESSLER A MAYBE ABOUT -- SIX WEEKS AGO -- WHEN HE WAS AT A CONFERENCE -- THAT WAS IT THAT IT WHICH I WAS INVITED TO ATTEND AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE COUNSEL. WHO -- APPEAR REGULARLY BEFORE THE COMMISSION AND SO IT WAS A FORM -- BY WHICH STAKEHOLDERS COULD PARTICIPATE IN THE IMPORTANT ISSUES -- WITH THE CJ PAEAN SO CERTAINLY THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO TO PURSUE THOSE KINDS A CONVERSATION BUT I WONDER FROM THE C. JP'S PERSPECTIVE IS THIS SOMETHING OUTS AND CURRENTLY OBVIOUSLY OUTSIDER AUTHORITY HE MADE THAT CLEAR. BUT IS IT SOMETHING THAT YOU BELIEVE WOULD. HELP EFFECTUATE A GREATER. APART GREATER INTEGRITY PERHAPS GREATER COMPLIANCE WITH CODES OF THE JUDICIAL CODE OF ETHICS. IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN DO THIS -- AT THE FRONT END RATHER THAN AT THE BACK END. SO THE THE AND THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS YES IN TERMS OF PUTTING ON EDUCATION. LIKE THAT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR PURVIEW ANDERSON IN AS I MENTIONED WE DON'T HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO ORDER IT -- AND TO ORDER ORDER CORRECTIVE ACTION. DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DISCIPLINE BUT CERTAINLY WERE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND YOU KNOW OTHER UP. OTHER APPROPRIATE ENTITIES IN IN IN FIGURING OUT -- EDUCATION THAT WILL BE -- EFFECTIVE IN TRAINING JUDGES ESPECIALLY WERE ETHICAL CONCERNS ARE INVOLVED THANK. THANK YOU. PLEASE MR TERRACE BUT IT TO CORRECT A COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU HAD A QUESTION I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO RESPOND SO I I DO APOLOGIZE I DID MISSPEAK MISSPEAK. IT WASN'T THE REFERENCE TO THE DISCIPLINARY RECOMMENDATIONS -- AS FROM THE SPECIAL MASTER SAMPLING BUT IT WAS THE DIFFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE THE SPECIAL MASTERS FINDINGS. AND FACTUAL FINDINGS THAT THE COMMISSION IS HESITANT TO CHANGE THOSE FINDINGS AND AN AYE AYE I DO WANT TO REITERATE THAT I AM SURE. THE VAST MAJORITY IF NOT ALL OF THE SPECIAL MASTERS ARE VERY WELL TRAINED AND ARE ACTING VERY ETHICALLY I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS REALLY THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION. AS ABSOLUTE JACKSON MENTIONED IN THAT WHETHER IT'S TRUE OR NOT AND WHETHER THEY HAVE THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN AN OATH TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION OR NOT. FROM THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION THAT IS WHAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND SO FROM A PROCESS STANDPOINT YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE MOD. THING LIKE THAT WHICH IS THE WAY THE OTHER AGENCIES -- HANDLE THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS WITH THE FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO HANDLE IT AND I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU A LOOK AT THOSE OTHER MODELS. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PUBLIC HEARING I WASN'T -- IMPLYING THAT THOSE -- HEARINGS DO NOT HAPPEN IN PUBLIC WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO IF THE PUBLIC'S IMPACT ON GET ON THE RULES THAT THE COMMISSION HAS AND AND MORE OF AN OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WAY WITH RESPECT TO CHANGE IN THOSE ROLES. THANK YOU FOR THE LET ME JUST ASK YOU GUYS YOUR THOUGHTS BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE UNICAMERAL BICAMERAL -- OPTIONS HERE. SO JUST BE THOUGHTS ON THAT. HI AGAIN I JUST WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AND AS WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR LETTER THE WAY THAT THE OTHER AGENCIES WORK AND THAT THEY SHOULD SEPARATE. AND THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD BE HAPPENING AND ON ONE SIDE AND THAT SHOULD BE VERY SEPARATE FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH. THE DECISION MAKER IS I THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THAT. THANK YOU I VOTERS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS AND IS DEEPLY ANALYZED -- OVER THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONSTITUTIONAL MEMBERS PRESENTED TO THE VOTERS. AND I THINK THIS IS -- A HEALTHY OPPORTUNITY I BELIEVE THAT'S THE WORD. THE STATE AUDITOR USED OPPORTUNITY HERE TO EXAMINE AND LOOK AT HOW THINGS HAVE BEEN RUNNING IN IN WHAT -- INPUT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS -- FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER -- TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A A A A MAJOR -- STRUCTURAL A CHANGE I THINK REALLY REQUIRES -- MORE THOUGHTFULNESS MORE DELIBERATION MORE INPUT. RATHER THAN SIMPLY RELYING ON THE ATTORNEYS MODEL AS IMPLEMENTED BY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION. AND THEIR RECOMMENDATION GRANT. IT'S A VERY -- THOUGHTFUL AND AND AND SALAS -- PLAN HOWEVER CALIFORNIA IS UNIQUE AND I THINK WE SHOULD NOT BE FOLLOWING. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE BASED ON OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE NOT LIKE THE JURISDICTION OF CALIFORNIA SO LIKE THAT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION IS TO JUST PROCEED SLOWLY WITH THIS AND AND REALLY -- THE DELIBERATIVE THROUGH YOUR PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME ASK OF ANY ADDITIONAL TESTS MUDDY WATER PROVIDE BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL. OKAY THANK YOU WITH THAT WE'LL GO AHEAD AND WILL MOVE TO AGENDA ITEM NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS PUBLIC COMMENT. CENTER FOR ONE FROM THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF COMMENT. ASK THAT YOU PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION WITH. OR WHICH COUNTY RESIDE. THANK YOU THE NAME IS ALIGNED AND I'M WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CIVILIAN CHAPTER TEARS ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE AUDIT THAT TOOK PLACE TODAY. WE HAVE SOME VERY VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE NEED TO EXPRESS. WE CONDUCT OUR OWN AUDIT AND I'M SO HAPPY THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COURT SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE TWO LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA. BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTY COURT SYSTEMS SUPERIOR SMALL CLAIMS UNLIMITED AND LIMITED SUCKS CIVIL CASES WE'VE ON COVERED OVER TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS NEARLY TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN EMBEZZLED SECURITY. BECAUSE THESE JUDGES HAVE NOT INSURED THAT THERE IS A WARRANT OVERTURNING. A SECURITY AGREEMENT. A CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT. CERTIFICATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF THE STATE REQUIRED UNDER TITLE. TWENTY EIGHT EVIDENCE OF A VALID FICTITIOUS BUSINESS LICENSE WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR FOR ANY ATTORNEY TO PRACTICE WITHOUT A VALID FICTITIOUS BUSINESS PARTY. UP LICENSE. IS THAT THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST IS ACTUALLY BEING REPRESENTED. THE AUTHORITY TO TRAFFIC SO BILLION PERSONS OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES INTERSTATE FROM INTRASTATE. AND THE LACK OF A CREDIBLE WITNESS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS WERE ATTORNEYS ARE ALLOWED TO TESTIFY. TO REMOVE HOMEOWNERS IN SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS WHICH ARE ILLEGAL. YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO TRY TITLE AT A STATE SUPERIOR COURT. THESE ARE ALL DEBT COLLECTION ACTIONS WHICH SHOULD BE HELD UNDER TITLE FIFTEEN SIXTEEN NINETY TWO IN THE DISTRICT JUDICIARY COURTS AND THEY ARE NOT. SO EVERYONE OF THE JUDGES WERE FORMER ATTORNEYS SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A SECURITY AGREEMENT THERE WAS A CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT AND THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR US TO HAVE A JUDICIAL COMMISSION. BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY FRAUD TAKING PLACE IN OUR COURT SYSTEM. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COURT SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY BEING USED AS A LEGAL ICE FENCE FOR THE EXTORTION EMBEZZLEMENT AND MONITORING OF CASH ITEM SECURITIES THAT ARE BEING CUT AT BEING. A MAN MONEY LAUNDERED BECAUSE YOU'RE DISGUISING AND HIDING THE REAL PARTY IN INTEREST WAS THE EMPLOYEES SECURITIES COMPANY NOW I AM VERY UPSET TODAY AND THE REASON I'M UPSET BECAUSE ALL THESE CHAIRS ARE EMPTY. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PUBLIC SERVANTS. THE PUBLIC GOES LAST SO DOES THE PER PUBLIC INTEREST WHICH MEANS THAT THEY'RE NOT DOING YOUR DUTY. WHICH IS ALWAYS INTO US OF THE SAME THINGS ALL THESE OTHER TO SO IT DISAPPOINTING I JUST HAD TO RUN DOWN THE HALL IN ORDER TO CATCH THE THIS JACKSON BETH JACKSON. AND THIS IS RIDICULOUS QUÃ© PUBLISHES SPEAK FIRST YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR PROCEDURE BECAUSE HAVING THE PUBLIC SPEAK LAST AND THEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN HERE TO HEAR IT. IT'S JUST A CONTINUATION OF THIS SERVICE SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME THINGS IN PLACE WE NEED TO HAVE CREDIBLE WITNESSES WE NEED TO SEE THAT THESE JUDGES HAVE ANTI BRIBERY STATEMENTS. THAT THEY HAVE BALLOT FOREIGN AID YOU AGENT REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS REQUIRED FOR ALL OF THEM AND WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF A BOND BEFORE THEY ACCEPT ANY FUNDING OF ANY CASE. IF WE DIDN'T THOSE MINIMUM THINGS WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE HERE TODAY. SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE THIS TO YOU IN WRITING. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT LAY PERSONS SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING IN THESE HEARINGS THEY SHOULD BE CIVILIANS ONCE WHO ARE VERSED IN LAW AND GOVERNMENT WANTS TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LEGAL AND LAW. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR STICKING AROUND -- MY NAME IS KATHLEEN RUSTLING THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE. THE AUDITOR'S LONG AWAITED REPORT IS AN EXCELLENT JOB OF EXPLAINING JUST HOW FAR CALIFORNIA'S ONLY JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT AGENCY HAS DRIFTED. IN THE PAST SIXTY YEARS FROM FULFILLINGITS CORE MISSION OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. FROM JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. AS THE ORGANIZATION THAT LED THE THREE YEAR EFFORT TO SECURE THIS AUDIT THE CENTER FOR JUDICIAL EXCELLENCE IS NOT AT ALL SURPRISED BY THESE FINDINGS. WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE C. JP'S INCOMPETENCE FOR MORE THAN THIRTEEN YEARS. THIS AUDIT REPORT CONFIRMS WHAT WE'VE KNOWN FOR SOME TIME. THE C. J. P. AS IN CRISIS AND THE PUBLIC THAT YOU SERVE NEEDS THE LEGISLATURE TO PLEASE STEP IN NOW. TO HOLD THE JUDICIAL BRANCH ACCOUNTABLE BY IMPLEMENTING THE AUDITOR'S NUMEROUS. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND INITIATIVE. THE C. JP'S HARM TO THE PUBLIC IS WROUGHT THROUGH ITS ONGOING SECRECY POOR MANAGEMENT LACK OF STRATEGIES ARE TIME LINES. INADEQUATE INVESTIGATIONS LACK OF PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ACCESS BIAS AGAINST INVESTIGATING COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC WASTE OF UP 240% OF ITS BUDGET ON NON CORE ACTIVITIES. AND ITS RESISTANCE TO TRACK PATTERNS OF CHRONICJUDICIAL MISCONDUCT BY SPECIFIC JUDGES. THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE CJ PEAS INTAKE ATTORNEYS DID NOT IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF ALLEGATIONS AGAINST SPECIFIC JUDGES. IN ONE EXAMPLE THE CJ P. RECEIVED TWELVE COMPLAINTS IN LESS THAN TEN YEARS ABOUT A PARTICULAR JUDGES DEMEANOR AND BIAS ON THE BENCH AND YET. THOSE COMPLAINTS WERE ALL CLOSED WITHOUT DISCIPLINE. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE C. J. P.. HAS EXPRESED RESISTANCE TO IMPLEMENTING THE AUDITOR'S CRUCIAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO HOUSE STAFF DETERMINE BROADER PATTERNS OF JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. BY CONSIDERING THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST A JUDGE ESPECIALLY IN CASES INVOLVING BIAS AND LEGAL ERROR. MR DRESSER SITES DUE PROCESS CONCERNS IN ADOPTING THIS RECOMMENDATION WITH ALL DUE RESPECT WHERE IS THE CONCERN FOR PUBLIC PROTECTION WHY HAVE ONLY THREE C. J. P. EVENTS OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. TARGETED THE PUBLIC IS THE AUDITOR POINTED OUT WHEN THE CJ PEACE CORPS MISSION IS SUPPOSEDLY. TO PROTECT US THE PUBLIC. FINALLY THE IN THE OUGHT. REVIEWED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS ALL BUT TWO OF THE JUDGES WHO RECEIVE PUBLIC DISCIPLINE. HAD BEEN THE SUBJECTS OF PRIOR COMPLAINTS NINE SAW COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM CLOSED WITHOUT DISCIPLINE 58% OF THOSE WHO ARE PUBLICLY DISCIPLINE HAD PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED PRIVATE DISCIPLINE. CLEARLY. THE CURRENT DISCIPLINE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING WE NEED A WHOLE NEW CULTURE OF JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP WE'RE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THIS IS. SIMPLY THE BEGINNING AND NOT THE END AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ON REFORMING THE SYSTEM THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS JACQUELINE CARA I HAVE AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PROTECTIVE MOTHERS OF SOLANO COUNTY IT'S AN ADVOCACY. GROUP AND SOLANO COUNTY. LET ME TELL YOU WHY WE CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IN SOLANO COUNTY ALONE AND SHOW US THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE DEATHS. DUE TO JUDICIAL DECISIONS YOU PROBABLY HEARD ON THE NEWS A STORY ABOUT CALLIE ANDERSON JUST LAST YEAR. SACRAMENTO SHE WAS FOUND IN A LITTLE GIRL ABOUT THE AGE OF FIVE FOUND IN A STORAGE LOCKER IN SACRAMENTO. A FATHER IN HEAVEN SOLE CUSTODY AFTER YOU GOT OUT OF JAIL IN A DRUG REHAB PROGRAM. THE JUDGE IN THIS CASE HAD A LONG HISTORY AND PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF DISMISSING CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE. THE CJ P. HAD PRIVATELY ADMONISH THIS JUDGE. THERE HAD BEEN TO RECALLS ISSUED OF THE SAME JUDGE AND NEWSPAPER ARTICLES TRYING TO DRAW ATTENTION TO IT. NOTHING WAS DONE. AND NOW THIS CHILD DIED THERE WAS ANOTHER MURDER OF ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL ANOTHER WOMAN MOTHER OF OF FOUR CHILDREN CAN YOU SHOULD JACKSON. JUST TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS AGAIN A CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE THE PUBLIC TRIED TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE C. J. P. I KNOW ATTORNEYS HAD REPORTED IT TO THE C. J. P.. NOTHING WAS DONE THE JUDGE DISMISSED ALL OF THE CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE AND SAID. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO GRANT THIS MOTHER A RESTRAINING ORDER I DON'T THINK HE'S THE MAN'S GOING TO KILL HER. TWO MONTHS LATER SHE WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN OUR OWN HOME IN FRONT OF HER CHILDREN. THIS IS JUST A FEW OF THE MANY CASES THAT WE HAVE WHERE THESE ARE NOT. A JUDGE WITH LOTION BLOW BLOOD SUGAR BEFORE LUNCH. THESE THIS IS A PATTERN AND PRACTICE [inaudible] OF ONE THING THAT THE CDP IT. IS TO LOOK FOR BIAS THERE ALSO TAPS WAS LOOKING FOR PERJURY I'VE WORKED WITH THE FBI PUBLIC CORRUPTION UNIT THEY'VE ATTENDED HEARINGS IN SOLANO COUNTY. THEY'VE SAID TO ME JACQUELINE. THESE CHILDREN WERE LEGALLY KIDNAPPED THE JUDGE KNOWINGLY LIED IN THEIR COURT ORDER TO COVER UP WHAT THEY DID AND YOU KNOW THE US ATTORNEY SAID UNLESS WE CAN PROVE QUID PRO QUO WE CAN'T GO AFTER THE JUDGE. WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE JUDGE WAS PAID TO LIE BUT WE CAN'T PROVE THE JUDGE WAS PAID TO LIE. ABSOLUTE POWER CORRUPTS ABSOLUTELY THE ONLY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE C. J. P. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THEM TO DO THEIR JOB WE DON'T NEED ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE DON'T NEED -- LET'S MAKE SURE YOU ARE DOING OKAY EMOTIONALLY TODAY IF YOUR CHILD WAS THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN MURDERED BECAUSE OF A JUDGE'S BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE LAW YOU WOULD NOT BE OKAY WITH THAT RESULT. I LASTLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FACT. THAT THE APPELLATE PROCESS DOES NOT ADDRESS FACTS AND EVIDENCE WE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT IF THERE'S LEGAL ERROR THEN TAKE IT UP WITH THE APPELLATE COURTS EVERY ATTORNEY KNOWS THAT THE COURT OF APPEAL DOES NOT REASSESS FACTS AND EVIDENCE. SO BUT SAYS EUROPE HAD A FILE. NO ONE ELSE'S YOUR PET A FILE THERE ISN'T ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE FOR THAT BUT A JUDGE SAYS IT IN THEIR COURT ORDER. AND YOU COMPLAIN TO THE C. J. P. AND SAY HEY THIS JUDGE KNOWINGLY LIED TO ME THE CJ PEOPLE SAY TAKE IT UP ON APPEAL. THE COURT OF APPEAL WILL SAY WE DON'T REASSESS FACTS AND EVIDENCE THE PRESIDING WILL JUDGE WILL SAY WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT WE DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE JUDGE. IF YOU GO TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SAY WE WANT YOU TO PROSECUTE THE JUDGE FOR PERJURY THEY'LL SAY THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. AND WE KNOW AS I SAID WITH THE FBI UNLESS WE CAN PROVE THE JUDGE GOT PAID TO LIE THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT EITHER THE ONLY RECTIFYING PROCESS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. IS THE CJ PIECE SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS AUDIT WE ASK THAT YOU WOULD CONTINUE WITH THE AUDIT THAT THERE WOULD BE EVEN MAYBE WE CAN SCHEDULE IT'S FOR EVERY COUPLE YEARS. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF HE ICEBERG IN RECTIFYING THIS PROBLEM BUT THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLACE. THANK YOU AN ERROR NO DORY I'M -- MOM FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY I SPENT FOUR YEARS IN THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM SO UNLIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE PANEL HERE I ACTUALLY AT FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THEM. SEEM TO THINK. THEY HAD HAD MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN FAMILY COURT -- I WANT TO THINK THE TWO OF YOU. THANK YOU I THINK IT'S APPALLING THAT EVERYBODY GOT UP AND LEFT AFTER WE WAITED FOR TWO AND A HALF HOURS. TO MAKE THESE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND WE WE LISTEN TO EVERYTHING THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAD TO SAY AND THEN WHEN IT'S OUR TURN EVERYBODY GETS UP AND WALKS OUT. SO. I I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. MOST OF THESE CASES WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN I LEFT THE AND I WAS SENT A COURT ORDER THAT SAID I WAS EVICTED FROM MY HOUSE I COULD NOT RETURN HOME I COULD NOT RETRIEVE ANY MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS. AND MY TWO YOUNGEST CHILDREN MY THE COST I WOULD I WAS REMOVED FROM BOTH PHYSICAL AND LEGAL CUSTODY OF THEM. THIS WAS ALL DONE BASED ON A PRESUMPTION THAT IS RIGHT MY CHILDREN WERE TAKEN FROM ME. BASED ON A PRESUMPTION NOT ON FACTS IN EVIDENCE NOT ON A TRIAL. THE LAWMAKERS SHOULD CREATED THIS LOCK CODE PRESUMED THAT THE JUDGES WOULD BE ETHICAL ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A HEARING. TO REBUT THIS PRESUMPTION. MY JUDGE DENIED ME A REBUTTAL A HEARING FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. SO THE LAWMAKERS ARE NOT IN LINE. GOING ON IN THE COURTROOM YOU ARE ASSUMING YOU ARE WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE BY US IN OUR ETHICAL AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A HEARING IN A TIMELY MANNER I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN OUR FAMILY COURTS. CALIFORNIA HAS A STRICT DIRECTIVE VISITATION WITH THE PARENT CANNOT BE DENIED UNLESS THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD. I WILL TELL YOU. I KNOW HUNDREDS OF PARENTS PERSONALLY WHO ARE DENIED VISITATION BASED ON NOTHING MORE THAN A JUDGE'S PERSONAL OPINION. THIS IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS HOW DO YOU PUT THAT INTO A COMPLAINT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT COMPLAINT RELEVANT. APPARENTLY WERE NOT USING THE RIGHT SEMANTICS BUT IF YOU THINK TAKING SOMEONE'S CHILD AND DENYING VISITATION IS LEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU. THE US SUPREME COURT HAS DETERMINED THAT A PARENT COULD NOT BE STRIPPED OF LEGAL RIGHTS TO THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT A STRICT SCRUTINY HEARING. WHEN I TOLD MY JUDGE I WANTED A STRICT SCRUTINY HEARING SHE LEANED INTO THE MICROPHONE AND SAID MISS SO DORY STRICT SCRUTINY DOES NOT APPLY IN MY COURTROOM? NOW THIS IS A COURT ROOM STILL ON WILL. ON LAND IN THE UNITED. ERICA SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPT EXCEPT THAT I'M DEALING WITH THE QUARTERBACK FORTY INSTEAD OF A COURT OF LAW WHICH MEANS THAT ALL OF THE DECISIONS ARE BASED ON HEARSAY RATHER THAN FACTS OR EVIDENCE. WHEN THIS PANEL SITS HERE IN SAYS NEITHER PARTY IS HAPPY IN COURT OUTCOMES AND LITIGANTS ARE SIMPLY LOOKING TO BLAME A JUDGE? IT SHOWS YOU THEIR LACK OF EDUCATION OR WILL FOR WILLFUL IGNORANCE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR FAMILY AND JUDICIAL COURT. WHAT WE ARE PRESENTING TO YOU IN TRYING TO TELL YOU IS THAT THE MINUTE YOU WALK INTO FAMILY COURT? OR JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT THERE'S A COMPLETE DISREGARD OF DUE PROCESS. THERE'S A BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE LIBERTY INTEREST PROTECTED BY THE US CONSTITUTION. AND I WILL ARGUE THERE'S A WILLFUL AND INTENTIONAL DESTRUCTION OF FAMILIES FOR PROFIT. THIS IS NOW A FIFTY TWO BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. TO THINK THAT JUDGES ARE NOT GOING TO SUCCUMB TO COLLUSION AND CORRUPTION IS ABSURD. TO THINK THAT WE DON'T NEED A WATCH STAR THAT HAS TEETH IS ABSURD. IN FAMILY COURT. DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY. DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. IT DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO A HEARING IN A MANNER. AS I MENTIONED I WAS DENIED A HEARING FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. NOW IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S AN APPEALS PROCESS WELL I DID TRY THAT APPEALS PROCESS. FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS I WAS DENIED A HEARING FROM MY APPEAL THEY WAITED UNTIL MY DAUGHTER AGED OUT OF THE SYSTEM TO HEAR MY APPEAL AND THEN THEY DETERMINED IT WAS MOVED. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO POINT OUT ABOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE IT COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND THAT. THE COURT TRANSCRIPTS THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE READILY AVAILABLE THEY ARE IF YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY FOR THEM. THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST A PARENT KEEPING CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN. IF YOU CAN CONCLUDE PLEASE OKAY. I'LL WRAP IT UP BUT I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING HERE FOR YEARS WE SAID. THAT THEIR MASS INCARCERATION WAS NOT INTENTIONAL ON THE PART OF OUR CRIMINAL COURTS AND NOW I'M LISTENING HERE AND FOR YEARS WE'VE BEEN SAYING THAT OUR FAMILY IN JUVENILE COURT OR NOT INTENTIONALLY DESTROYING. FAMILIES I'M HERE TO TO SAY THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND THE TWO THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR PARENTS EVERY THREE DAYS IN THE FAMILY FAMILY AND JUDICIAL COURT. TENNESSEE COURTS IN THIS COUNTRY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. SKEWS ME AND I TOO WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT ARE. ELECTED OFFICIALS WOULD RUN OUT THE DOOR I THANK YOU FOLKS FROM THE GYM. THE COUNCIL FOR STATE I REALLY APPRECIATE. I'M A BRITISH FITS PATRICK FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND I REPRESENT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY'S INTERESTS. AND THE INTERESTS OF THE UNPROTECTED PUBLIC. THE AUDIT ON THE C. J. P. STATES IN CHAPTER ONE QUOTE. FLIES IN THE C. JP'S INTAKE AND INVESTIGATION PROCESS SEES. COULD ALLOW JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT TO CONTINUE. WHICH IMPLIES THAT IT'S ALREADY GOING ON JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT AS AN HAS OCCURRED. IN THIS POSSIBLY MOST EVIDENT IN FAMILY COURT. THE SEXUAL TORTURE AND MURDER OF CHILDREN. HAS BEEN ENABLED. BY DEEPLY FLAWED TO JUST ALL DECISIONS OFTEN. UNBIASED IN INCOMPETENCE. WHEN I WROTE THE C. J. P. ABOUT A JUDGE SENDING MY GREAT NIECE? TO LIVE WITH HER DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTED. EX CONVICT MALE PARENT. WHO IS AWAITING TRIAL FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? I RECEIVED A LETTER AFTER ABOUT A YEAR. TELLING ME THAT THE JUDGE HAD DONE NOTHING WRONG. THEY DID NOT ADDRESS MY COMPLAINTS. THEY DID NOT EXPLAIN HOW THEY CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION. NINE MONTHS AFTER THE MALE PARENT IN CUSTODY. AFTER REPEATEDLY DRUGGING AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER. HER MALE PARENT MURDERED HER. AND BURIED HER IN THE BACKYARD. HE PHOTOGRAPHED HIS BEHAVIOR WITH THOUSANDS OF PICTURES ON HIS COMPUTER. THAT TOOK THE FBI TEN MONTHS TO FINALLY GET. TO AFTER HE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES HE CONTINUED HIS PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. WITH A SIXTEEN AND AN EIGHT YEAR OLD. OLD SINS CAST LONG SHADOWS. THE JUDGE IS FLAWED DECISION. WITH PRONOUNCED BIAS AGAINST THE MOTHER. HIS DISREGARD OF THE MANY SIGNS OF DANGER. ENABLE THE PETA FILE AND MURDERER. TO IMPRISON. TORTURE AND MURDER HIS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SEVERAL OTHER CHILDREN HAVE MET A LEASE YOU MYSTERIOUS FATE. SINCE SHE WAS MURDERED. AND NOBODY DOES ANYTHING YOU DON'T CHANGE A LOT YOU DON'T FIND THE JUDGES AT FAULT. IT KEEPS GOING ON PLEASE DO YOUR JOBS. THEY MAKE THE LAWS SO WE'LL KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE. THE JUDGES WILL NOT HAVE SO MUCH DISCRETION THAT THEY CAN IGNORE EVIDENCE OF ABUSE AND SEND THEM TO LIVE WITH DANGEROUS PEOPLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHARON KRAMER AND I'M HERE FROM SAN DIEGO. CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA TRY TO BE BRIEF MY COMMENTS. AND I'M A WHISTLEBLOWER JUNK SCIENCE A US PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY THAT. WAS BEING MARKETED TO COMMIT INSURER FRAUD IN MOLD ISSUE AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF LOBBYING I'VE GOTTEN FEDERAL ON SAID. WASHINGTON DC I JUST BECAUSE THE NAVY TO RETRACT A NEW PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE. BUT I FIRST READ THIS IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE AND GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER ENDORSE THE JUNK SCIENCE AND CALIFORNIA. HEALTH POLICY SIX MONTHS LATER IN CALIFORNIA COURT STARTED FRAMING ME FOR LIBEL FOR EXPOSING FRAUD WAY BACK SO. I AM FILE MY FIRST COMPLAINT TO THE C. J. P. IN OCTOBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND TEN AND ONE OF THE PEOPLE I COMPLAINED ABOUT WAS THE CHAIRWOMAN MYTHS AJP. AND TEN DAYS LATER A SECOND LAWSUIT WAS FILED TO TRY TO PERMANENTLY AND JOIN ME. ON WHAT I COMPLAIN TO THEM ABOUT WAS SO BORN IN THE PERJURY. IN THE STRATEGIC LITIGATION LÃ  TRYING TO SHUT ME UP. AND IN THE SECOND LAWSUIT I WAS SENT TO JAIL. FOR REFUSING TO SIGN A PIECE OF PAPER WHICH SAYS I DO NOT BELIEVE THE PLAINTIFF COMMITTED PERJURY. SO. THEY LOOK THE ONE OF THE LADIES MENTIONED THE PERJURY THAT'S GOING ON PUNISHED AND THE COURTS AND THE C. J. P. IS NOT ADDRESSING AT YOU KNOW IT IS DISRESPECTFUL THAT EVERYBODY LEFT HERE. AND THAT YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TALK ABOUT -- 90% OF THOSE PRO PURRS DATE THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. YOU KNOW WE COST. HIDE IT WE THE PUBLIC THOSE OF US WHO WORK FOR THIS. WE'RE NOT STUPID WE KNOW WHAT A LEGAL ERROR IS WE KNOW WHAT A LEGAL ERROR OF JUST BIAS THAT NEEDS A LITTLE. YOU KNOW LITTLE NUDGE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE AND WE ALSO KNOW WHAT CRIMINAL LEGAL ERRORS ARE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. SAID THIS IS WHAT I WANT YOU OUT TO ADDRESS. THE C. J. P. HAS WRITTEN A ROLE FOR THEMSELVES. THAT THEY NAY REPORT CRIMINAL CONDUCT IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO THOSE WITH PROSECUTING AUTHORITY NOT THAT THEY SHALL REPORT THEY MAY. SO IF YOU GO TO THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL AND YOU REPORT A CRIME OF THE JUDGE. THEY FLIP YOU OVER TO THIS GO GO SEE THE C. J. P.. THE C. JP THEY DON'T REPORT CRIMES TO THOSE ARE PROSECUTING AUTHORITY. SIMPLY HAVE ON HOLY RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW BETWEEN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND ARE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. AND I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY THE REAL BOTTLED LACK. OF ITS BE. CRIMINAL CONDUCT THAT'S OCCURRING IN THESE COURTS WITH THE AND NO ONE'S HOLD THINKING AND RESPONSIBLE. AND HERE'S MY LAST COMMENT. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS AUDIT TO COME OUT BECAUSE I WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULD. REALLY BRING THIS CRIMINAL ASPECT TO LIGHT. I HAVE TO FILE ANOTHER COMPLAINT WITH THE C. J. P.. I'M AFRAID TO FILE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE A NOT THERE SEE JAY PEAK COMMISSIONER HIS ON THE COMMISSION NOW WHO'S INVOLVED. EXTENSIVE CASE FIXING. I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA GET PHYSICALLY HURT AGAIN IF I FILE ANOTHER COMPLAINT SO I SENT A LETTER ASKING WHAT CAN YOU DO TO PROTECT ME. AND COMMON I GOT BACK FROM MISS SONYA SMITH WAS WE CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THE JUDGES DO. SO DO I FILE ANOTHER COMPLAINT TO TRY AND STOP THIS CRIME I DO I LIVE IN FEAR. BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING TO PROTECT ME FROM RETALIATION. THAT'S MY PRESENTATION I HOPE YOU TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION PLEASE IT'S NOT JUST THEM IT'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THANK. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. I SPEAK NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR DOZENS OF PROTECTIVE PARENTS SURVIVORS OF HONORABLE JUDGE BEVERLY WHAT. MANY. NOT BE HERETODAY AS THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED OUT OF WEALTHY MARIN COUNTY OR INTO HARDSHIP BY JUDGE WHAT'S PUNITIVE CHILD CUSTODY AND FINANCIAL ORDERS. BY THE LUCRATIVE NEEDS COTTAGE INDUSTRY OF COURT AFFILIATED PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS REUNIFICATION THERAPIST AND SUPERVISED VISIT SUPERVISORS. MOST IMPORTANTLY I SPEAK FOR MY PRECIOUS CHILDREN. IS COMMON SENSE FOR THE CJ T. H. C. J. P. TO TAKE STEPS TO IDENTIFY PATTERNS OF COMPLAINTS. AND INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS WERE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ALLEGE SIMILAR PROBLEMS INVOLVING A JUDGE. I HAVE FILED SEVEN COMPLAINTS WITH THE C. J. P. AND PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT ARE JUDGING GAUGES AND JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. AND DOES NOT UPHOLD THE CODES FOR JUDICIAL CONDUCT SUCH AS SHE ENGAGES AN EX PARTE COMMUNICATION WITH MY CHILDREN'S FATHER. I INFORM THEM THAT OUR FAMILY UNDERWENT TO CUSTODY EVALUATIONS PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING OF BOTH PARENTS AND SEVEN SAKE C. F. S. INVESTIGATIONS. I ALSO SENT TO C. J. P. AUDIO RECORDINGS THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO THE COURT A FATHER SEVERE VERBAL ABUSE OF THE CHILDREN. IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME AT THE C. J. B. P. READ THE EVALUATIONS TRANSCRIPTS CFS REPORTS OR LISTEN TO THE RECORDING. JUDGE WAS STRIPPED AWAY PROTECTIONS PREVIOUSLY ORDERED BY ANOTHER COURT THAT WERE IN PLACE TO PROTECT US AND PLACE MY CHILDREN INTO THE PRIMARY CARE OF THEIR FATHER. A DOCUMENTED PERPETRATOR OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT HAS A LIFETIME IMPACT ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES EVERY SINGLE DAY. OUR CHILDREN LIVED PRIMARILY WITH THE FATHER THAT INFLICTS EMOTIONAL TORTURE UPON THEM IN A SIMILAR MANNER THE TURF AND CHILDREN WERE TORTURED BY THEIR PARENTS. MY CHILDREN'S FATHER IS A DOCTOR. HE HAS BEEN ENABLED ABUSER BECAUSE OF JUDGE WHAT. HE HAD SUPERVISED VISITS FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS. HIS POWER PRIVILEGE AND WEALTH AFFORDS HIM THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR EXPENSIVE LAWYERS EXPERTS AND PROFESSIONALS. TO MY CHILDREN'S FATHER OR CASSIE BATTLE IS ABOUT THREE THINGS WINNING CONTROL AND MONEY. HE'S MODERATELY GOOD IMAGE CONTROL AND GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF BEING A CARING FATHER ALTHOUGH HIS ACTIONS DO NOT MATCH HIS WORDS. I WANT MY CHILDREN TO HAVE THE SAME HUMAN RIGHTS TO AN ABUSE FREE CHILDHOOD THE OTHER CHILDREN HOUSE. THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ABUSED. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEIR FATHER IS AN ABUSER AND THE COURT HAS ENGAGE IN BIAS MISCONDUCT. WE NEED TO HAVE AUDIO RECORDINGS IN TRANSCRIPTS OF ALL FAMILY COURT PROCEEDINGS IN ALL COURT ROOMS. IT TAKES NEAR SUPER HUMAN ABILITY FOR REPRESENTED MOTHER OR FATHER TO NAVIGATE THE APPELLATE PROCESS. NOT EVERYONE CAN AFFORD AN APPELLATE ATTORNEY IT FEELS CAN EASILY COST TWENTY TO NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. IS DANGEROUS COMPLAINT IS TO HAVE THE DETAILS. A THEIR COMPLAINT DISCLOSED DIRECTLY TO THE JUDGE THAT ENGAGES IN JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT DUE TO THE JUDGE. KNOWING WHO THE COMPLETE MADE THE COMPLAINT AND RETALIATING. I AM ONLY HERE TODAY BECAUSE MY CHILDREN ARE CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN UP THE SYSTEM. IF THEY WERE YOUNGER I WOULD BE TOO AFRAID TO SPEAK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY PLEASE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON. pBEEN AN ATTORNEY FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS. I HAD OCCASION TO DEAL WITH THE C. JP ON A CASE OF JUDGE CORRUPTION. FOR CLIENTS I REPRESENTED IN THEIRCASE WE MADE A COMPLAINT TO THE C. J. P. ABOUT THIS JUDGE'S CRIME. IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE JUICY J. P. HAS NOT RESPONDED OR DONE ANYTHING FOR OVER THREE YEARS. IN THE CASE ADAMS VERSUS C. J. P. OUR CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SAID THAT THE C. J. P. IS THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY CHARGED WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE POP. FROM JUDICIAL CORRUPTION. I DIDN'T HEAR ANYONE MENTION THAT HERE TODAY. AND IN FACT THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE CJ P.. C. J. P.. THE C. JP RECEIVES THREE TYPES OF COMPLAINTS ONE THAT SOMEBODY APTLY REFERRED TO THEM AS SOUR GRAPES PEOPLE ARE ANGRY AT THEIR JUDGE THEY COMPLAIN TO THE C. J. P. BUT IT'S REALLY NOT A C. JP COMPLAINT. NEXT IS MISCONDUCT AND THERE'S LOTS OF MISCONDUCT UNFORTUNATELY RACIAL SLURS WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT THOSE THINGS MAY BE CRIMINAL OR THEY MAY NOT THE THIRD CATEGORY IS CRIME WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PERSON REPORTS TO THE C. J. P. THAT A JUDGE HAS COMMITTED A CRIME AND PROVIDES CREDIBLE. EVIDENCE THIS REALLY UNDENIABLE. THAT PROVES THAT JUDGE CRIME WHAT HAPPENS [inaudible] ANSWER NOTHING. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS? IS THAT THE CJ P. SUPPRESSES THAT EVIDENCE OF JUDGE CRIME IT DEEP SIX IS THAT. AND DOESN'T SEND IT TO PROSECUTING AUTHORITIES THE RESULT IS THAT IN THIS STATE TODAY. BECAUSE OF THE C. JP PRIMARILY. JUDGES THAT WANT TO COMMIT CRIMES NO THEY CAN DO SO WITHOUT. FEAR OF BEING PROSECUTED. NOW LET ME RELATE THE CASE THAT LED ME TO THIS CONCLUSION. I REPRESENTED -- NUMBER OF SENIORS IN A SENIOR MOBILE HOME PARK IN SAN CLEMENTE VERY VALUABLE PIECE OF REAL ESTATE. THERE WAS CAN THERE WAS LITIGATION PROBLEMS. LOS IT WENT ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS I REPRESENTED SOME OF THEM WE HAD ONE PARTICULAR JUDGE. IN THE LAWSUIT WE CAME TO BELIEVE HE WAS BIASED AGAINST US. THEN WE LEARNED THAT THE CROOKED H. O. A PRESIDENT AND OTHERS HAD ESSENTIALLY RIG THE SALE OF THIS EXTREMELY VALUABLE MOBILE HOME PARK. TO IT TO A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER THAT THE BROKER NEW. WHAT WE DO WE FILED ANOTHER LAWSUIT TO STOP THE SALE? NOW PROCEDURAL A WHEN YOU FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT THAT'S RELATED TO ANOTHER LAWSUIT. THE RELATED THE NEW RELATED CASE GET SENT TO THE SAME JUDGE THAT'S LOGICAL. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE. BUT THEN WE FILED A ONE SEVENTY POINT SIX PEREMPTORY CHALLENGE TO DISQUALIFY THAT JUDGE HE WAS DISQUALIFIED ON THE CASE AND A NEW JUDGE WAS APPOINTED. HE WAS DISQUALIFIED BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDING JUDGE THIS IS STANDARD PROCEDURE. THREE WEEKS LATER WE LEARNED. THE CRIMINALS INVOLVED IN STEALING THIS PROPERTY FROM THESE ELDERLY PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE PLANNING TO CLOSE THE SALE OF THIS OF THIS. THIS QUIRK AND SALE AT MILLIONS BELOW MARKET THEY WERE PLANNING TO DO THAT ONE PARTICULAR DAY. SO THE DAY BEFORE I WHEN YOU NEXT PARTY TO STOP THAT SALE TO OBTAIN A T. RO A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER. IT WAS THAT THE MATTER WAS PLACED BEFORE THE NEW JUDGE NOT OUR FIRST JUDGE THAT WE DISQUALIFIED BEFORE THE NEW JUDGE. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I GOT TO THE COURTHOUSE I WAS TOLD -- THE NEW JUDGES ARE GOING TO HEAR THIS CASE IT'S BEEN SENT BACK TO THE OLD JUDGE. AND I WASN'T CLEAR HOW THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE. BUT WE WENT TO THAT COURT ROOM. THEN THE OLD JUDGE WOULD WE JUST QUOTED WE HAD DISQUALIFIED WAS NOT THERE AND WE KNEW HE WASN'T THERE BECAUSE HE HAD STATED ON THE RECORD IN ANOTHER CASE THAT HE WOULD BE ON VACATION. ANYONE BECAUSE HE WASN'T THERE. WHAT DID HE DO THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS HE ISSUED AN ORDER TO STOP MY T. R. O.? HE'S NOT EVEN THE JUDGE ON THE CASE. WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT I GUESS A SECOND THOUGHT HE ISSUED AN ORDER? SHALL FREE QUALIFYING HIMSELF BACK ON TO THE CASE. NOW THAT IN SEOUL. TO THE PUBLIC EVERYONE UNDERSTAND YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED WHETHER YOU'RE AN ATHLETE A JUDGE AND JURY YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED. YOU'RE OFF THE TEAM AND YOU DON'T GET TO SELF RE QUALIFY I HEREBY RE QUALIFY MYSELF. NO. THE JUDGE CELL FREE QUALIFIED STOP THE T. R. O. HE'S NOT EVEN THERE IS ON VACATION. FOUR HOURS LATER THE DEED FOR THE CROOKED MULTI MILLION DOLLAR RIP OFF SALE THE SENIORS RECORDED THAT SAME AFTERNOON. SO I ASKED THE JUDGE. REPORT PROCESS ESSENTIALLY. YOU KNOW HOW THIS HAPPENED. OBVIOUSLY JUDGE YOU KNOW YOU WERE ON VACATION SOMEBODY CALLED YOU AND SAID YOU KNOW PLEASE FIX THIS FOR US PLEASE DO THE FIX. THE JUDGE SAYS NO I DIDN'T HAVE ANY. X. PARTY CONTACT WOW IS THAT POSSIBLE. YOU WERE ON VACATION THE CASE ISN'T IN YOUR COURT YOU ARE DISQUALIFIED ON THE CASE UNDER CAÃ±ADA MEDIC THREE BE YOU CAN'T EVEN TOUCH THE CASE. YET YOU CALLED IN AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME. TO TO FIX IT SO THAT THE CROOKED SALE COULD CLOSE. THE COMPLAINT WITH THE C. J. P. WAS EXTREMELY. COLLUSION SO WE CAN ALLOW ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY AS WELL THANK YOU. AND THE STAFF OF THE DID THEIR JOB INITIALLY THEY ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION THEN IT WAS DEEP. SIX THE LADY EARLIER MENTIONED THE PROBLEM WITH THE C. J. P.. IF YOU LOOK AT IT SEE JP RULE ONE OH TWO G. AND POLICY DECLARATION FOUR POINT. TO THE C. J. P. SAYS IT MAY REFER JUDGE CLOCK CRIME TO A PROSCAR MAYBE IT WILL AND MAYBE IT WON'T HOW CAN THAT BE. HOW CAN IT NOT BE THAT THE C. J. P. MUST REPORT THE JUDGE CRIME IN MY FINAL POINT? IN THE FACEOF THIS CRITICISM. TO THE C. J. P. DOES NOT REFER JUDGE CRIME. IN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE C. J. P. SAID IN ITS RULE AMENDMENT REPORT. THAT THAT ACCUSATION WAS FALSE THAT IN FACT THE C. J. P. HAS REFERRED JUDGE CRIME ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. SO IN MY LAWSUIT AGAINST A CJ P. I. ONE AFTER MY SAID FINE. FILL OUT THIS FORM SHOW US HOW MANY TIMES YOU REFER JUDGE CRIME WE CAN ONLY FIND ONE EXAMPLE SEARCHING HIGH AND LOW AND WHAT TO THE C. J. P. SAY I'LL SAY. THAT SECRET INFORMATION. THAT SECRET WE'RE NOT GOING TO TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES ON THOSE MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WE REFERRED NOW [inaudible] THE INFORMATION. SECRECY IS JUST. BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WHAT THE C. J. P. SAID TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE REFER JUDGE CRIME ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE. AND IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE MOST OF THAT MOST OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES NOT HERE AS THE PUBLIC SPEAKS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE IS THE IS THE C. J. P. THE LEGISLATURE EVERYONE IS IGNORING THE PUBLIC. GIVE THE PUBLIC SOME CREDIT YOU KNOW I I HEAR CONSTANT CRITICISM OF THE PUBLIC ARE THEY SENDING COMPLAINTS TO THE C. J. P. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. PEOPLE KNOW -- UNDERSTAND. THE PROBLEM HERE IS NOT THE PEOPLE THE PROBLEM IS A TRULY BROKEN C. J. P. THE NEEDS TO BE JUNKED IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REINVENTED. THIS THAT THE WISE OF PEOPLE OF THIS STATE TWICE HAVE REVAMPED THE CJ P. BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LAW THEY'VE DONE THAT TWICE. NOW WE'RE AT THE THIRD TIME IN AS WE ALL KNOW THEY SAY THE THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM SO NOW I'M GONNA DO ALL I CAN AS AN OFFICER OF THE COURT. HAVING SWORN TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION I'M TO DO ALL I CAN TO MAKE THAT THIRD TIME. THE CHARM WE'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU. PLEASE LET'S PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] WELL. OUR I WOULD DONE. TO MY COLLEAGUES STATEMENT ABOUT CORRUPTION -- I A START UP WITH TWO THINGS WITH MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE JP. THEY DON'T TELL THE TRUTH AND THEY DON'T GIVE EXPLANATIONS. AND SENSE -- THE HIGHEST CRITERION OF BEING A JUDGE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. THE DISCIPLINARIAN SHOULD ALSO TELL THE TRUTH. AND THEY SAY THEY THEY WRITTEN IS RULE FOR THEMSELVES THAT THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN EVERYTHING ANYTHING BUT CONSTITUTION ARTICLE SIX I THINK IT'S PARAGRAPH AM IN THERE. AND THEIR AUTHORIZATION SAYS. THE THE COMMISSION MAY MAKE EXPLANATIONS THAT'S ONE OF THE HANDFUL OF POWER SIX OR SEVEN POWERS AT THEIR GIVEN BY THE CONSTITUTION. AND THEY'VE WRITTEN A RULE BY WHICH THEY SAY WE DON'T HAVE WE CANNOT TELL YOU ANYTHING SO YOU GET THESE DECISIONS FROM THEM I ONLY DID IT ONCE. THAT ARE COMPLETELY OFF THE WALL HAVE NO RELATION TO THE FACTS OR THE LAW. AND WE HAD A BIG THING EARLIER WELL IT WAS ON THE TRANSCRIPT WHITED TAKEN YEARS AND YEARS. AW IT'S ON THE TRANSCRIPT HERE. THE JUDGE SAYING. I DECIDED THIS CASE ON EX PARTE COMMUNICATION I DID NOT READ WHAT YOU FILED. THE JUDGE SAYS IT NOT NOT MANY WORDS BUT HE ADMITS IT ON THE RECORD WHEN DID YOU READ MY MISSION. NO I DON'T THINK YOU FILED. HE WAS THERE IN THE COURT'S FILE -- SO. MY FEELING AFTER BEING THROUGH THIS NO EXPLANATION [inaudible] COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL. FALSE EXPERT DECISIONS. I SUSPECT THAT. A COMPLAINT TO THE C. J. P. AT THE INTAKE LEVEL THESE THINGS MAY BE SORTED. AND IT'S A CHANCE FOR SOME ROGUE ELEMENTS. TO RECRUIT THE JUDGES IN. TWO SOME COSA NOSTRA -- THE THING ABOUT THE TRANSCRIPT THAT SHOULD BE DEFINITIVE. WELL. I ADDRESS GOOD IN THIS CASE AND THE DIRECTOR REVIEW THE CASE AND SAID THERE'S NO BASIS FOR ACTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT TAKES THERE'S CRIME GOING ON IT COULD BE A RICO CASE I CAN INVESTIGATE. ON MY POWER -- THAT YOU COULD THIS IS THE CASE IT NEEDS AN AUDIT. I'VE TOLD US SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT IT THEY'VE BEEN BRIEFED ON IT -- WELL WITH. YOUR OWN SO THERE'S A THERE'S A BIG. LOOPHOLE. THIS CONTROLLED BY THE CJ P. HELLO PAUL AS EVERYTHING SEEMS. AND WE WE DUMP THIS CASE IN THAT WHOLE NOBODY EVER SEES IT WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT IT DOESN'T EXIST. AND I THINK A REALLY DEEP AUDIT NOT THIRTY CASES I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS THAT ARE ALLEGEDLY NO BASIS FOR ACTION AND I HAVE ONE FOR YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE -- I HAVE. STUDIED THE ROBERTS RULES OF ORDER I ASSUME THAT THIS COMMITTEE RUNS ON A SIMILAR FORM SO IF IT'S POSSIBLE I'D LIKE. TO EXECUTE A QUORUM CALL -- WE WILL BE DOING THAT THIS TIME THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. OKAY WELL INITIAL POLICY BUT OKAY PLEASE PROCEED WITHOUT COMMENT UNDER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT. THAT DOESN'T GIVE US A RIGHT TO GO TO THE PRESIDENT AND PRESENT A PETITION BUT IT GIVES US A RIGHT. TO PETITION SOME ENTITY IN GOVERNMENT OKAY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IS DIFFERENT WE NOT ONLY HAVE A RIGHT TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT BUT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO INSTRUCT. THE GOVERNMENT AND SO I'M HERE TO INSTRUCT THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE ASSEMBLY ON WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DISCUSS SO MAY I ARRANGE A TIME WHERE I MADE A FULL COMMITTEE IT CAN BE IN SEVERAL MONTHS OR WHATEVER BUT I WANT. TO BE ABLE. TO UNDER DUE PROCESS OF LAW TO PRESENT THE ISSUES THAT I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS TODAY CAN WE MAKE THAT TIME WE CAN DO IT OFF THE RECORD SO YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME -- TO PRESENT YOUR COMMENTS TODAY YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO SUBMIT. TO THE COMMITTEE WHICH WE CAN RELATE TO EACH OF THE MEMBERS -- WHAT I DO WANT FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND ALSO IS DURING THIS PUBLIC COMMENT EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT SEE SOME OF THE THE MEMBERS HERE IS EACH OF THEM ARE PROVIDED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY GO BACK? AND REVIEW THIS AS WE ARCHIVE THIS -- THROUGH OUR ARCHIVES SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE VIDEO IT AND GET THE TRANSCRIPT AS WELL OKAY BUT WHAT IS THE PROBABILITY THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY LOOK. AT THE A VIDEO RECORDING OF WHAT I'M ABOUT TO PRESENT. ALL YOU TYPICALLY THE STAFF AT EACH OF THE OFFICES ARE MONITORING ALL THE COMMITTEES THAT THEIR MEMBERS SERVE ON SO -- I WOULD SAY FOLLOW UP WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL OFFICE BUT IF YOU SUBMIT SOMETHING WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET THAT EACH OF THEM OKAY COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M NOT TIME I'M JUST BEGINNING BUT I I'D LIKE TO COMMEND YOUR POLITICAL SKILLS FOR NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION -- AS TO THE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION CITIZENS HAVE A RIGHT TO INSTRUCT THE GOVERNMENT NO ONE HAS EXPLAINED WHAT THAT MEANS [inaudible] OKAY. TO ME AGAIN. I WAS SO THIS TO THE PHOTOGRAPHER IF HE COULD TAKE A PICTURE OF IT. THIS IS A PICTURE. OF THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL OFFICER IN THE CALIFORNIA JUDICIARY. SHE IS ENDORSING THE PUBLIC THE PRIVATE -- PRIVATE JUDGING BUSINESS OF I'M NOT GONNA MENTION HIS NAME AND I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION HER NAME BECAUSE I CAN'T PRONOUNCE IT. BUT THIS OKAY YOU'RE LOOKING FOR CRIMINAL CONDUCT. INVESTIGATE THIS HERE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST JUDICIAL OFFICER ENDORSING THE PRIVATE BUSINESS OF A NON ATTORNEY. NOW THE NON ATTORNEY CONDUCTS A WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS A LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE. HE'S NOT A LAWYER HE DOESN'T HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE SUPREME COURT TO CONDUCT A LAWYER REFERRAL SERVICE. SO UNDER NO CONCEPTION CAM A NON ATTORNEY REFER AT LEGAL CASE. ANYWHERE AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR A FEE BUT YET MR RECORD CENTER BY VANCE DOES EXACTLY THIS WITH THE THE CONSENT AND ENDORSEMENT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE. OF THE CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THE RECORD I'M GOING TO PRESENT THIS WOOD SIDING COLLUDED A COMPLAINT TO THE TO THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE BUT THEY ARE IGNORING IT. NOW I THINK UNDER ANY CONCEPTION OF DUE PROCESS IGNORING A COMPLAINT NO MATTER HOW REPETITIOUS PEOPLE THINK OF IT IS A DENIAL OF DUE PROCESS. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION ALL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE TO GIVE AN EXPLANATION OF ALL OF THEIR DECISIONS. SALTAR LATE I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNCIL THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. PASS ANSWER MY COMPLAINT AND EXPLAIN HOW THEY CAN POSSIBLY CONDUCT AN IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WHO HAS A PUBLIC REVIEW. AND SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION OVER ALL OF THEIR ACTIONS. OKAY NOW THE THIRD ASPECT OF WHEN I JUST PRESENTED IT'S CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE. SIXTY ONE FIFTY ONE WHICH IS WHICH PROHIBITS RUNNING AND CAPPING OPERATION NOW A RELATIVE OF THE WHO WAS HELP ME PREPARE FOR THIS SAID. GREGORY DO NOT USE A SLANG TERM WHEN YOU READ JESSE AN AUGUST BODY SUCH AS THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON JESUS SO. FOR YOURSELVES WELL THE MEMBER AND CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. SIXTY ONE FIFTY ONE PROHIBITS EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON IS PETER ACCURATE SAID SOLICITS REFERRALS OF CASES FROM CIVIL COURTS. AND JUDGES JHANSI CANALIS ON JUNE TENTH AND JUNE -- JANUARY TENTH AND JANUARY SEVENTEENTH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN REFERRED MY CASE. TO PETER ADKISON NOW. GONNA LIE I ASSUME DIDN'T RECEIVE A FEE [inaudible] BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVE THAT. OKAY BUT THEN PETER RECORDS. REFERRED MY CIVIL CASE WHICH IS A DIVORCE CASE TWO IBM'S RETAINED. ATTORNEYS SOME OF WHOM ARE RETIRED QUOTE UNQUOTE RETIRED JUDGES. AND I HAVE TO NOTE THAT UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION RETIRED JUDGES DO NOT HAVE ANY STATUS. OKAY NOW ON THIS NIGHT MY FIRST RECOMMENDATION OR REQUEST IS TO GET A SOLID RESPONSE TO MY CLAIMS OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE. OKAY MY SECOND REQUEST IS. TENSION I CAN GIVE YOU A COPY OF THE PICTURE IF YOU LIKE IT I GIVE TO THE SERGEANT AT ARMS. THINK ABOUT THIS. IF YOU CAN CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL. OKAY I HAVE SPENT THREE DAYS COMING HERE IN PREPARATION FOR THIS AND I'M GETTING SHORT SHAFTED BECAUSE NO OTHER MEMBERS ARE HERE BUT I AM NOW. PRESENTING A PETITION TO THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S BEEN A LONG ISSUE SO I THINK I USED TO BE GIVEN MORE TIME [inaudible] NOW. PRINCIPLES OF ETHICS ARE VERY IMPORTANT HERE. JUDGES ARE DISQUALIFIED. IF THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST. I DO THAT PICTURE AND PRESENTING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CONCLUSIVELY DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST HERE. BECAUSE THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS ENDORSING. RECORDS AND MARTHA BALLENGER WHO IS A TEMPORARY JUDGE. AND I ADVANCE. OKAY. WHEN THERE IS A TEMPORARY JUDGE THERE HAS TO BE A STIPULATION? I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENFORCE A STIPULATION TO USE MARTHA BALLENGER AS A TEMPORARY JUDGE. I HAVE EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER PRESENTS AT AN INVESTIGATION OKAY NOW I DON'T PRESENTED. AS A CURIOUS QUIRK OF THE SUPREME COURT PROCEDURE INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES INCLUDING THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN THIS CASE. CAN DIVERT DISMISS OR REFER A WRIT OF MANDATE BACK TO THE APPELLATE COURTS AND HAVE THEM DEAL WITH IT BUT GUESS WHAT THEY THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN THIS CASE DIDN'T HAVE TO PRODUCE A RECORD. SHE ACTED ON THEIR OWN. BUT THE CONFLICT IS THE WRIT OF MANDATE THAT I FILED TWICE. TO ENFORCE A STIPULATION WHAT TO USE A TEMPRARY JUDGE MARTHA BALLENGER. SHE DIVERTED TO READ TO MANDATE ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WITHOUT CAN BE EATING EVEN A CORE OF WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT. THREE JUDGES PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE EASIER FOR THE SERVICE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICS TO THE CASE SOME OF THE GENERAL PARAMETERS OF WHAT WE SPOKE WITH ABOUT THE HEARING HERE. FOR YOUR THE SPECIFICS IN THE CASE YOU BRING UP PERHAPS WE CAN SPEAK AFTER IS TO ALLOW OTHER FOLKS. TO SPEAK DURING PUBLIC COMMENT MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE YOU SIT WITH THE STAFF AS WELL TO GO THROUGH -- ANY PARTICULAR GRIEVANCE OR AWAY IN YOUR PARTICULAR CASE THAT WE CAN HELP ADDRESS THE IN. THE ENTIRE. OKAY SO MY THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS. FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE HAS STATED THAT IT DOES NOT. REVIEW THE ACTIONS OF RETIRED JUDGES. OKAY NOW THAT MIGHT THAT MIGHT BE SOLID REASONS FOR THAT BUT THE MINUTE BUT THESE THREE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION. USE THAT TO ABDICATE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REVIEW THE ACTIONS OF ALL JUDGES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION ALL JUDGES YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THE TERM JUDGES OR JUDGE IS USE OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. I'LL TELL YOU IT'S NINETY NINE FOR MORE THAN MARTIN LUTHER'S THESIS. ONE OF THOSE JUDGES IS A TEMPORARY JUDGE. NOW TEMPORARY JOBS IT'S NOT A TEMPORAL ASSIGNMENT IT DOESN'T REFER TO ALL THIS JUDGE IS ON THIS CASE ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. TEMPORARY JOBS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICE. MEANING AND I WANTED TO ADDRESS MISTER ALLEN'S COMMENTS WHEN HE ASKS -- EDGES OFFICER WHO IS ELECTED OR DULY APPOINTED. I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE JUDGMENT ON THAT PACKAGE. MARTHA BALLENGER IS LISTED AS A JUDICIAL OFFICER. THAT IS DIRTY POOL THAT IS JUDICIAL FROG SHE IS NOT A JUDICIAL OFFICER. HE IS MERELY A RETIRED JUDGE HE HAS NOT WON AN ELECTION SHE HAS NOT BEEN DULY APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. BUT I HAVE THREE PRESIDING JUDGES JOHN C. VINEYARD. HAROLD W. HOP AND BECKY L. DUGAN. ALL THREE PRESIDING JUDGES HAVE BEEN DOORS. JUDGE HARMON'S. DESIGNATION OF A NOBODY AS A JUDICIAL OFFICER. SO I WANT I CALL FOR AN INVESTIGATION ON THAT. AND ALSO THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD. OKAY THIS IS NOT A MATTER OF DISCRETION. THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE HAS A MANDATORY DUTY TO WRITE RULES TO INVESTIGATE ALL JUDGES. NOW JUDGES REFERS TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE WELL I'M CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION ON WHAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE DOES. BUT FOR THREE YEARS NOW THE COMMISSION HAS IGNORED MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT WANT TO BALANCE HER. AND I'LL TELL YOU THE REASON AFTER I SUM UP. THEY HAVE IGNORED BY COMPLAINTS AGAINST BECAUSE THEY SAY WELL WE DON'T INVESTIGATE RETIRED JUDGE RETIRED JUDGES I'M NOT ASKING THEM TO INVESTIGATE A RETIRED JUDGE. I'M ASKING THEM TO THANK YOU FOR COMMENTS YEAR NOW I SEVEN TIMES LONGER THAN WHAT WAS ALLOTTED. I ASKED FOR TWO MINUTES TO SUM UP. OKAY. FOR THREE YEARS THEY HAVE IGNORED MY REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE MARTHA BALLENGER. BUT THEY HAVE A MANDATORY CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO INVESTIGATE HER AS AN ACTIVE. TEMPORARY JUDGE. AND I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS OF THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE ADVOCATES ITS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE SITTING JUDGES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOTHER BALLENGER'S THE GRAVEST CONSTITUTIONAL ERROR. SHE DID NOT TAKE HER OATH OF OFFICE. AND SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS SENATOR ALLEN'S POINT IS. THIS IS NOT A JUDICIAL OFFICER SEES NOT DULY SWORN. IF YOU WANT TO BE A TEMPORARY JUDGE THE CONSTITUTION MANDATES THAT SEE TAKE ITS OF CHARTER OATH OF OFFICE. HE DIDN'T DO IT. AND I'M NOT ASKING FOR A BIG INVESTIGATION HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR THE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE THE MOTHER BALANCER DIDN'T TAKE ROTH OF OFFICE. IT WOULDN'T TAKE MORE THAN ONE OR TWO MINUTES. BUT HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN TO TAKE ME TO GET IN FRONT OF A BODY LIKE THIS AND NOW YOU'RE CUTTING ME OFF I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS LIMITED TIME BUT TELL US. BUT I ASSURE YOU I'M GOING TO VISIT EACH ONE OF YOU IN CHAMBERS IS HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE. THE RETIRED JUDGE WHO'S OATH OF OFFICE BY THE DETERMINATION AND HOLDINGS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S AT RISK A JUDGE RETIRES OATH OF OFFICE IS NO LONGER VALID. SO WE HAVE AN UNSWORN TEMPORARY JUDGE WITH YOU INDIVIDUALLY AND LOTS OF OKAY. WHO SAID THAT? WHO ARE YOU? OTHER OUR PUBLIC AND I'M TALKING. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU.

AND FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN THE RECORD THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE HERE IF YOU GUYS COULD JUST STAY FOR A MINUTE. BE BACK AFTER THIS -- I'M A PUBLISHER MY NAME IS SUSAN BASSY AND I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE STATE PUBLISHING INFORMATION ON OUR FAMILY COURT -- I HAVE. INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE C. J. P. I'VE WORKED DIRECTLY WITH MISS DRIVERS. I WORKED WITH MR DRESSER WHEN HE WAS AT THE STATE BAR AND I BELIEVE HIM TO BE A LIAR. I ANSWER TO THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. AND AS PUBLISHERS OF DONE RECENTLY WE HAVEN'T DONE OUR JOB VERY WELL WE HAVE ENGAGE THOSE USE BACK THERE. THEY'RE READING INSTAGRAM FACEBOOK AND GOOGLE THEY'RE NOT READING PRINT PUBLICATIONS THE DAILY JOURNAL ISN'T EVEN A CONCEPT TO THEM. AND YET THE LAWYERS AND THE JUDGES ARE ALL TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES AND DECIDING HOW TO RULE OUR COURTS. I'M A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS YOU GUYS CAN LOOK IT UP I KNOW YOU HAVE PHONE OUT TO YOU CAN LOOK IT UP. THE LAWYERS IN THE ROOM WILL KNOW WHAT A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT IS. WHEN I WAS MEETING WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES ON A COLLABORATION ON PRIVATE JUDGING STORY? I ASKED THE REPORTER IF HE KNEW WHAT A VEXATIOUS LITIGANT WAS AND HE TOLD ME NOW. HE'S MARRIED HE JUST HAD HIS FIRST BABY. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR SIX MONTHS ON AN INVESTIGATION. WORKING ON WITH MY ASSOCIATES IN THE MEDIA FOR FIVE YEARS WERE BETTER THAN THE C. J. P. AT INVESTIGATING. THEY WILL TELL YOU AND THEY WILL COME FOR YOU THAT THEY INVESTIGATE THEIR COMPLAINTS THEY DO NOT LOOK AT PATTERNS THERE IS A RULE IN THE C. J. P. ONE ONE ONE POINT. FOR THE SAYS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT THE PATTERNS IN THE PRACTICES OF THE JUDGES. MISTER MOORE I JUST SAW YOUR FACE WHEN YOU HEARD MISS NEWMAN SPEAK. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE C. J. P. ABOUT SEVEN JUDGES. EACH OF YOU GOT THIS REPORT ON YOUR DESK THIS IS GONNA BE OVER YOUR HEAD. YOU'RE NOT GONNA UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MEANS WHAT THIS MEANS IS THE JUDGES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. WILLIAM DANCER WAS INDICTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE JUDGE PERSKY WAS RECALLED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE ARE A COUNTY THE ONCE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF OUR JUDGES AND WHEN THE CJ P. DOESN'T DO THEIR JOB. WHICH THEY DID NOT ON BUILDING ANSWER THE PUBLIC TOOK CARE OF IT A GRAND JURY INVESTIGATION INDICTED BILL DANCER. THIS REPORT IS FIVE YEARS WORTH OF WORK. THIS TALKS ABOUT THE PATTERN AND PRACTICE AND HOW VERY SLOWLY JUDGES BEGAN SHIFTING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO ATTORNEYS TO DO THEIR JOBS. THEY'RE CALLED REFEREES SPECIAL MASTERS PRO TEM JUDGES PRIVATE JUDGES PRIVATELY COMPENSATED JUDGES AND IT IS FOUND IN THE CIVIL CODE OF PROCEDURE SECTION SIX THIRTY EIGHT AND SIX THIRTY NINE NOW MOST OF US GET IN THE FAMILY COURT. AND WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE LAW. WE SPEND OUR LIVES IN PUBLISHING OR FARMING OR HOME STAGING OR HOME CARE FOR OUR CHILDREN. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE EXPECTED TO KNOW THE LAW. MISS NOODLE MAN HAD BEEN MARRIED TO A PROSECUTOR. WHILE SHE WAS MARRIED. HE SECRETLY RECORDED CRIMINAL HEARINGS AND MADE HER TRANSCRIBED THEM AT NIGHT WANTING TO GET A JUMP ON THE TRANSCRIPT. THE OFFICE WHERE HE WORKED WAS KNOWN FOR PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. AND WIN EIGHT INVESTIGATIVE STORY CAME OUT ABOUT THAT PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. THE ONE OF THE PROSECUTORS STARTED WORKING WITH THEM TO POINT THEM TO WEAR THAT WOULD BE. AND A LAWYER FROM OUR COUNTY WHEN I BECAME THE CHIEF TRIAL COUNSEL OF THE STATE BAR. MR DRESSER GOT A COMPLAINT ABOUT NOT HAILS. WHEN HE WAS WORKING FOR THE STATE BAR? NOT HILLS WAS A REFEREE IN PAM NEWMAN'S CASE. NOT HILLS GOT CONFIDENTIAL DISCIPLINE. FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH THE CODE OF JUDICIAL ETHICS. DOES AND PROFESSIONS CODE. HE MADE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MY CASE HE MADE OVER TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN OTHER CASES. AND HE NEVER COMPLIED WITH THE LAW FILING HIS OATH OR EVEN POSTING THE MOST BASIC OF NOTICE SO THAT WE COULD FIND HIS CASES. THERE'S A REALLY SIMPLE LAW. CALIFORNIA RULE OF COURT TWO POINT. EIGHT THREE FOUR IT ASSURES THE PROCEEDINGS ARE OPEN. AND IT REQUIRES THE COURT CLERK IN EVERY COUNTY TO POST A LIST OF THE PRIVATE JUDGING CASES IN THE COUNTY. MISS NEWMAN'S CASE BEFORE JAMES YEAH HILLS IS CASES WERE NOT POSTED ON THE LIST. I'VE INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET RECORDS I OBTAINED FROM SEVERAL COUNTIES. AND IN THESE COUNTIES TWENTY SEVEN WHERE I HAVE DONE PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS UNDER RULE TEN POINT. FIVE OH OH THEY ALL SAID THEY DON'T KEEP THE LIST. THESE ARE SECRET PROCEEDINGS. WHO IS USING THEM? THE FOUNDER OF GOOGLE SERGEI BRENT GOT PRIVATE JUDGING. HIS NAME WAS NOT ON THE LIST WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR WHO ELSE MIGHT HAVE JUDGES SIMILARLY APPOINTED. IT WAS POSTED YEARS LATER BY SHARON ROPER AFTER HIS DIVORCE WAS DONE. THE GENERAL COUNSEL FOR THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY COURT LISA HERRICK HER JUDGE WAS HER BEFORE PRIVATE JUDGE. AND THAT WAS JAMES **** AND HIS NAME WAS NOT ON THE LIST YOUR COME TO CONCLUDE I'M GONNA COME DOING POLLUTION IN A MINUTE. THESE JUDGES HAVE BEEN SHIFTING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND CLAIMING THEY WANT INDEPENDENCE THEY'VE NOT BEEN INDEPENDENT THEY'VE EEN INFLUENCED BY ATTORNEYS WHO ARE CORRUPT AND ATTORNEYS WERE GETTING BENEFITS OF APPOINTMENTS. THE WORST IS HEATHER ALLEN. THE WOMAN WHO SPOKE EARLIER TO YOU TODAY HAD HEATHER ALLEN APPOINTED IN HER CASE I HAVE FOLLOWED FIFTEEN CASES INVOLVING HEATHER ALLEN AND LEASE MITCHELL. NONE OF THEM MET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY NEEDED TO MEET TO BE ABLE TO BE APPOINTED TO REPRESENT CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS DIVORCE CASES. MISS ALLEN HAS TOLD ONE MOTHER WHO WAS A VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HER HUSBAND HAD FELONY CONVICTIONS FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. MISS ALLEN SAID SHE THOUGHT THE% MOTHER MIGHT BE ALIENATING THE CHILD FROM THE CHILDREN AND SHE TOOK THE CHILDREN. THESE LAWYERS ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE LAW. THE SICK PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN SECRETIVE. AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SELF REPRESENTED HAVE BEEN PUNISHED. I WAS SANCTIONED. IN TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR REPORTING MY PRIVATE JUDGE TO THE BAR. THE BAR WHEN INVESTIGATING HIM CALLED ME UP AND ASKED IF I HAD BEEN DECLARED VEXATIOUS YET. THEY WANT ME QUIET I'M A PUBLISHER AND I'M NOT GONNA BE QUIET THIS IS IN YOUR PACKET THIS IS BEFORE THE STATE AUDITOR I'VE MADE WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINTS THE CJ P. IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. GREG DRESSER DIDN'T DO HIS JOB WHEN HE WAS AT THE STATE BAR SO TO EXPECT HE WOULD DO IT LOOKING AT JUDGES WOULD BE NAIVE AND WOULD BE COMPLICIT. WE INTEND TO DO OUR JOB BECAUSE WE CAN PUBLISH THIS. OUR BAR IS LOWER AND THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION IS STRONGER IT RECALLS JUDGES IT RECALLS PUBLIC OFFICIALS ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND WE WILL HAVE OUR SAY IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION WHERE WE'VE BEEN LOCKED OUT OF THE COURTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK WERE NEARLY COMING UP ON A OUT ALMOST AN HOUR OF PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU I AM KATHERINE CAMPBELL WITH CALIFORNIA PROTECTIVE PARENTS ASSOCIATION -- WE'RE HERE TODAY FOR OVER THREE YEARS AGO WE CAME TO ASK. FOR AN AUDIT FOR IN FAMILY COURT ABUSE CASES WERE BEING DISMISSED. THERE WAS JUDICIAL MISCONDUCT. VALID COMPLAINTS TO THE C. J. P. WERE ALSO BEING DISMISSED. ADVOCATES FOR JUDGES -- DURING WHETHER WE WOULD GET AND NOT IT WE'RE SAYING WE'RE JUST DESCRIBE LITIGANTS. BUT NOW WE HAVE THE ON IT AND WE CAN SEE. THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND THERE IS A PROBLEM. WE KNOW THE AUDIT SHOWS MAJOR FLAWS IN AT LEAST ONE THIRD OF ALL CASES REVIEWED. THE TIME FOR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR JUDGES IS NOW. CALIFORNIA DESERVES COURTS THAT PROTECT THE PUBLIC. AND THE C. J. P. WAS NOT PROTECTING THE PUBLIC NOR HAVE OUR FAMILY COURTS PAN. I CALIFORNIA PROTECT PARENTS ASSOCIATION WE REQUEST THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY OUR STATE AUDITOR BE ACCEPTED AND IMPLEMENTED. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT ANY PERSON WHO SITS ON A BENCH BE UNDER REVIEW FOR THE C. JP INCLUDING COMMISSIONERS. AND PRO TEM JUDGES. AND AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION NOT IN THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS SHOWN ABOUT THEY EIGHT TIMES. SOMEONE WAS ON REFERRED WE KNOW THAT -- IF THEY DECIDED TO RESIGN WHICH HAPPEN AND I THINK BELIEVE THIS CASE. THEY COULD THEN BE A PRO TIME TOUCH. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO SITS ON THE BENCH CAN ACTUALLY. ACCOUNT ABOUT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND WE ALSO ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE ARE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS AS WE'VE SEEN IN COLORADO -- I THINK. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE C. JP I MEAN I THINK THE AUDIT SAYS WE ALL SHOULD BE AND I APPRECIATE THAT THEY'RE HERE. AND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING THESE -- I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE IN THE LETTER IT SAID. THE RESPONSE LETTER IN THE AUDIT IT SAID THEY WERE BEING UNCOOPERATIVE. AND I DON'T BELIEVE SUING THE AUDITOR BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING THAT THE CLIP COMPLAINTS ARE VALID -- CONFIDENTIAL. IS BEING COOPERATIVE I AM TODAY THEY SAID THEY WERE BEING COOPERATIVE AFTER. THERE ARE AFTER THEIR LAWSUIT. WAS SETTLED. SO I THINK WHAT I'M SEEING IS IT'S TAKING TIME TO DIGEST. WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN THIS AUDIT AND THERE HAS BEEN NO OVERSIGHT? REALLY FAR JUDGES. I HEARD TODAY -- SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON SAID THAT SHE WAS OF THAT SHE IS CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO SERVE JUSTICE. AND HER COMMENT REALLY WAS. AT THIS WAS DUE TO WHAT THE OVERSIGHT WOULD DO ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS WITH TO SEE JP. MY TAKE ON IT IS THAT WE HAVE JUDGES WHO ARE NOT DOING. WHAT IS RIGHT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A CULTURE THAT DISMISSES ABUSE. AND IF THEY TRY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. THEY WILL NO LONGER HAVE THEIR JOBS. I'M WE HAVE HAD A COMPLAINT -- SOMEONE IN LOS ANGELES CALL TODAY THEY HAD FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE CJ BE A YEAR AGO. AND THAT COMPLAINT WAS. ENTERED INTO INVESTIGATION FACE SO IT COMPLIED WITH WHAT WAS NEEDED. AND THAT'S GREAT ON JUST AFTER THE AUDIT THAT WAS DISMISSED EVEN THAT WAS A VALID COMPLAINT. WE ARE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE VALID COMPLAINTS ACTUALLY MAKE THEM ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- REGARDLESS OF THIS -- YOU KNOW IT'S 50% LESS LIKELY THAT. PUBLIC WILL BE HEARD BY THE SEA JP. WHEN YOU SEE THAT I GET EVERYTHING I JUST -- I ALSO HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS TODAY ABOUT. BEHAVIORAL CLASSES -- WE WE DEAL WITH A LOT WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE MARRIED ABUSERS -- MURDERED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING THE PROTECTION AND THOSE JUDGES. CONTINUE ON THE BENCH. THANK YOU AND SO I JUST FINISHED THANK YOU SO I I JUST THINK. THAT ACCOUNTABILITY COMES. WITH BOUNDARIES AND ONE JUDGES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET -- IT'S TIME TO END THE DISMISSAL OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND OTHER FORMS OF ABUSE TO CHILDREN IN OUR FAMILY COURTS. IT'S TIME FOR US TO HAVE INSTITUTIONAL COURAGE. AND I WANT TO THANK JAY LACK FOR PROVING THE AUDIT FOR HAVING THIS IS A BEGINNING POINT A STARTING POINT. AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE WHO WORKS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY FOR OUR LAWS AND THE CODE OF ETHICS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND THAT WILL CONCLUDE THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION. AND LET THE RECORD REFLECT THAT WE SPENT ALMOST AN HOUR ON PUBLIC COMMENTS -- AS WE CONCLUDE TODAY'S HEARING -- I DO SEE THIS AS A BEGINNING OF A LONGER DISCUSSION NOT AS AN AND BY ANY MEANS ORANY STRETCH OF OF THAT -- I AM I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES AS WELL -- YOU KNOW THIS IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT THAT'S BEEN DONE IN FIFTY SIX YEARS. IT TOOK US A COUPLE OF YEARS TO GET TO THIS. I DON'T SEETHIS AS AN ENDING BUT RATHER A BEGINNINGAS WE LOOK. TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE OUTLINED. IT SEEMED IN THE PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL WERE IN ALIGNMENT WITH WHAT SOME OF THE AUDIT FINDINGS WERE AS WELL. SO -- WITH THAT YOU KNOW IT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WE WE DID HEAR FROM EVEN. THE PANELISTS WAS. PERHAPS THE NEED FOR MORE TEETH IN THE FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION -- FOR JUDGES AT THAT NEED THAT ACTION. AND SO WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT WE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED INTO THE IDEA OF A BICAMERAL SEPARATING THOSE POWERS OUT SO THAT THERE'S MORE ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. WE KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES. DESERVES SUCH THEY DESERVE ACCOUNTABILITY DO DESERVE DUE PROCESS. THAT AND THEY DESERVE TRANSPARENCY AND WE SHOULD KNOW THAT THIS IS DONE IN A PUBLIC BANNER IN AN OPEN MANNER. AND THAT THOSE MEETINGS ARE PUBLICLY HELD AND AND THAT WE HAD HERE TO ALL THE RULES. I GUIDING SUCH ACTION.
